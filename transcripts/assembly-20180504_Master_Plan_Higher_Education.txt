POPULATION GROWTH INCREASE STUDENT DIVERSITY CHANGE IN LEADING INDUSTRIES AND THEIR NEED FOR TALENT. AS WELL AS THE FIELD OF EDUCATION ITSELF. REPRESENTING SILICON VALLEY I SEE HOW QUICKLY TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCING ALONG WITH THE RISE OF NEW INDUSTRY. BOTH HAVE ALTERED STUDENT NEEDS AND BOOSTED DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. WE NEED OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO A HOST OF ISSUES. NEVER PREVIOUSLY ENVISIONED.

THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS THE FIRST STEP IN A MULTI YEAR ENDEAVOR TO UPDATE THE MASTER. I'M COMING IN WITH AN OPEN MIND AND DO NOT HAVE ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OR SOLUTIONS AND I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME. I DO THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS BEING THE INFORMATION GATHERING PHASE WHERE WE HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND COLLECT FEEDBACK WHICH IS WHAT WILL BE DOING TODAY.

I I'VE BEEN THE CHAIR FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS AND I SEE THAT THE DOCUMENT THE MASTER PLAN THAT WAS WRITTEN IN NINETEEN SIXTY. AS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN SAID NEEDS UPDATING BECAUSE AS HE SAID MUCH AS JANE. AND WITHOUT A VERY STRATEGIC A. GOLD PLAN A WE FLOUNDER. AND. AND THE DIFFERENT. SEGMENTS OF PUSH AGAINST EACH OTHER. AND OTHER MAY BE GOOD. THAT MAY BE GOOD YOU KNOW INNOVATION IS GOOD BUT I THINK IT'S FOR THE STATE IS. IT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE A CONSISTENT PLAN AND I I I I ALSO WOULD NOTE THE LACK.

AS A GRADUATE OF THE WHAT LAW SCHOOL S. C. FIND ON. AND. GUY LET'S LONG START OFF WITH. JULIE. AND THE. FOLKS IF THE A LIGHT ON THE TOP THE MIKE IS RED IT'S NOT ON. PERFECT. I GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MEDINA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. I SERVICE THE PRESIDENT THE ACADEMICS AND FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUTE COLLEGES. THE ORGANIZATION TRUSTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW TO BE THE VOICE OF FACULTY AN ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL POLICY MATTERS WE REPRESENT A FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM. I WILL FOCUS MY COMMENTS TODAY ON THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT STUDENTS AS THEY REACH FOR THEIR ACADEMIC AND CAREER GOALS. FACULTY NEED ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THREE VERY SPECIFIC REASONS TO MAINTAIN CURRENCY IN THEIR DISCIPLINES TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING AND TO FULFILL THEIR ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES IN COLLEGE GOVERNANCE AND SERVICE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED INTO LAW THE REFORM BILL FOR COMMUNICABLE EDGES AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE IT MOVED OUR SYSTEM AWAY FROM ESCAPE THROUGH TWELVE ROUTES TO A GREATER CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION LIKE CSU AND YOU SEE. ONE EFFECT OF THOSE CHANGES WAS THE ELIMINATION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CREDENTIAL WHICH WAS SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TODAY FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE. ESSENTIALLY AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE FOLKS ARE HIRING ON COMPETENCY IN A DISCIPLINE. ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN PEDAGOGY WOULD BE LEFT TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AT THE TIME THE LEGISLATURE DISCUSS REQUIRED A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COMMITTEE COLLEGE FUNDING TO BE SAID SPENT ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL STAFF SIMILAR TO WHAT CORPORATION SPENT ON TRAINING FOR THEIR WORKERS ABOUT FIVE PERCENT. THAT APPROACH WAS REJECTED IN FAVOUR OF A DISTINCT CATEGORICAL LINE ITEM FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS ELIMINATED IN THE FIRST THOUSANDS. MUCH OF THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY THE STATE IS DESIGNED TO TRAIN FACULTY ON IMPLEMENTING STATE DIRECTED FITNESS INITIATIVE SUCH AS THE STUDENT SUCCESS IN SUPPORT PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO CONSISTENT SUPPORT FOR FACULTY TO MAINTAIN CURRENCY IN THEIR AREA OF EXPERTISE OR TO IMPROVE AND PEDAGOGY. OF COURSE ALL COLLEGES SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM CONCEPT A FEW PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR ALL FACULTY TO ATTEND EVENTS. AS A RESULT FACULTY IN PARTICULARLY PART TIME FACULTY ARE FREQUENTLY LEFT TO BEAR THE COST PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ACTIVITIES WITHIN THEIR DISCIPLINES. TEACHING IS A FULL TIME JOB. BUT WHEN WE OUT ON THE REQUIREMENT FOR COLLEGE SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES OFFICE HOURS AND OTHER JOB. SERVICES FITTING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INTO ALREADY TIGHT SCHEDULES BECOMES DIFFICULT ADVANCED. COMPOUNDED WITH THE ADDITIONAL COST IN A LACK OF SUFFICIENT COLLEGE SUPPORT SUCH AS PROVIDING SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS IS QUITE CHALLENGING FOR FULL TIME FACULTY TO ATTEND AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR PART TIME. TO PURCHASE. WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY. AT INSTRUCTION LOW COST ACCESS TO OVER TWO MILLION STUDENTS ANNUALLY AND IN THE PROCESS CREATE MIRACLES FOR OUR STUDENTS HOWEVER WE FAILED TO PRIORITIZE THE MOST BASIC ASPECT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING. WHICH IS KNOWLEDGE CURRENCY FOR TEACHERS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PROFESSIONAL DEPARTMENT. OTHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SPECIFIC INITIATIVES MAY BE VALUABLE FOR INSTITUTIONS IT IS INSUFFICIENT FOR WHAT OUR FACULTY NEED AND BY EXTENSION FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE STATE CAN ENSURE THE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION BY INVESTING OUR MOST IMPORTANT RECENT SOURCE. THE INDIVIDUALS WORKING AT OUR COLLEGES ONE ACTION THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD BE TO DESIGNATE A PERCENTAGE OF OUR BASE FUNDING BE ALLOCATED TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ANOTHER ACTION THAT DOES REQUIRE FUNDING NEW FUNDING WOULD BE TO FIND THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CATEGORICAL. PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT A FACULTY WILL IMPROVE EVERY ASPECT OF OUR COLLEGES AND SURE THAT WE ARE READY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. I'D LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION NOW TO THE ISSUE OF FACULTY DIVERSE. THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS LONG BEEN IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING THE DIVERSITY OF FACULTY TO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. DOING SO IS CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. IN SUPPORT OF THE SCHOOL OF THE STATEWIDE EONE DIVERSITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE DEVELOPED A HANDBOOK ON BEST PRACTICES FOR PROMOTING DIVERSITY IN THE HIRING PROCESS. SUBSEQUENTLY THE ACADEMICS AND IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS ON IMPLEMENTING THOSE BEST SINCE WORKSHOPS WERE WELL ATTENDED AND RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MOST OF OUR COLLEGES. THESE CHANGES WERE PUT INTO PRACTICE WHEN COLLEGES HIRED FULL TIME FACULTY USING A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF SIXTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES IN FIRST TIME FULL TIME HIRES. HOWEVER WE WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THE RESULTS WE DESIRE FREE CONTINUE RELY ON AN INTERMITTENT APPROACH WHEN WE HIRE A GOOD NUMBER FACULTY ONE YEAR BUT IN OTHER YEARS EVEN WHEN THE STATE BUDGET IS STRONG WE RELY ON OUR PART TIME FACULTY. AND PERHAPS REPLACE THE RETIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE. WE NEED A SUSTAINED EFFORT THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE SET A GOAL OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CREDIT INSTRUCTION TAUGHT BY FULL TIME FACULTY. CURRENTLY OUR SYSTEM HOVERS AROUND THE AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. THIS LOW PERCENTAGE OF FULL TIME FACULTY HAS SOME VERY REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR COLLEGES. HIRING FULL FULL TIME FACULTY EVERY YEAR WOULD ALLOW US TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT GOAL. IMPROVE THE DIVERSITY OF THE ACADEMY AND PROVIDE THE CRITICAL SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS NEED FROM FACULTY OF ALL BACKGROUNDS TO ACHIEVE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. AND WHEN WE DO HIRE PART TIME FACULTY WE NEED TO HONOR THEM AS PROFESSIONALS BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO TEACH OUR DIVERSE BODY OF STUDENTS. SUPPORT FOR ANY ANY FACULTY MEMBER SHOULD INCLUDE OFFICE SPACE TO MEET WITH STUDENTS ADEQUATE COMPENSATION TO TEACH AND SUPPORT STUDENTS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS IDEA FREEWAY FLYERS. ACCESS TO HEALTH BENEFITS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO RECRUIT OUR OWN STUDENTS TO COME BACK AND TEACH AT OUR COLLEGES. THIS MEANS THAT THERE MUST BE A CLEAR PATH FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO SEE ES UN YOU SEE AS WELL AS MENTORING AND PAID INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THAT PATHWAY IS SOME ASSURANCE THAT A TEACHING POSITION OR SYSTEMS IN OBTAINING A POSITION IS AND AS AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE PATH. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE THREE EFFORTS DEDICATED FUNDING TO HIRE FULL TIME FACULTY PARITY FOR PART TIME FACULTY AND A PATH WE TO TEACHING IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING THE DIVERSITY OF OUR FACULTY TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR COLLEGES. TEACHING AS AN INTERPERSONAL ENDEAVOR. FUNDAMENTAL TO ITS SUCCESS IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN FACULTY AND STUDENTS FACULTY REMINDED DAILY OF THE POWER OF THIS CONNECTION IN OUR LEARNING SPACES BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL. AND WE ARE DEEPLY COGNIZANT OF THE NECESSITY OF SUSTAINED INTERACTION BETWEEN FACULTY AND STUDENTS AS THE MOST MEANINGFUL FACTOR THAT CONTRIBUTES TO STUDENT SUCCESS. SUPPORTING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL FACULTY WHILE IMPROVING THE DIVERSITY AND NUMBER OF FULL TIME FACULTY ARE COLLEGES WILL ENSURE A VIBRANT AND ENGAGING COLLEGE COMMUNITY WHERE STUDENTS WILL ENJOY A RICH ACADEMIC LIFE ARE PURSUING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE AND I WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROFESSOR BRUNO. AND A PROFESSOR MILLER. THINK YOU IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOUR DAY TALKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IN THE MASTER PLAN. YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE SIGN FROM THE LONDON METRO MIND THE GAP WHEN IT ADVANCES YOU'LL SEE IT. UP MY CLICKER PERSON STEPPED AWAY. THERE WERE BY YOU SEE NOTHING BEFORE ME IT'S ALSO A WAY FOR ME TO DEVELOP DEMON REMARKS. GONNA TALK ABOUT THE GAPS TO MIND IN CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION GAPS IN SKILLS ACHIEVEMENT COMPLETION FUNDING UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO EDIT THIS TESTIMONY TO OMIT DISCUSSIONS OF WORKFORCE AND TENURE DENSITY BUT MAYBE WE CAN DISCUSS THEM DURING Q. IN A. THE FIRST HAPPENED GONNA DISCUSS RELATES TO STUDENT BASIC SKILLS AND HOW FACULTY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ADDRESS THESE GAPS. SKILLS GAPS HAVE TO DO WITH THE PREPARATION STUDENTS BRING WITH THEM TO COLLEGE OR WHETHER THEY'RE COLLEGE READY. WITH THE CSU IS ADDRESSING SKILLS GAPS BY PURSUING DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION INITIATIVES AS PART OF GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. COURSE IS FORMALLY KNOWN AS REMEDIAL ARE BEING TRANSITIONED INTO CREDIT BEARING EXPERIENCES CONVERTING THESE COURSES IS REQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IN THE FORM OF COURSE REDESIGN USING APPROACHES LIKE SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION AND STRETCH MODELS. WEBINARS HAVE HOPE FACULTY TO MAKE THESE CHANGES IF YOU GO TO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE THIS SCREEN AND YOU CAN SEE THE TOPICS COVERED IN THE WEBINARS IN THE DROP DOWN MENU. NOTICE THAT ARE IN THE KNOW EVEN FACULTY PEPPER PATE REAL TIME IN THE WEAPON. IF THEY CAN WATCH OR REWATCH LATER. AND IF YOU EXPLORE THOSE CATEGORIES YOU CAN FIND THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS JUST THIS YEAR THIRTY CHIU WEBINARS HAVE BEEN OFFERED WITH A HUNDRED AND FIVE HOURS OF FACULTY DEVELOPMENT KATA. IN SOME THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF FACULTY DEVELOP RELATED CLOSING SKILLS GAPS AND HELPING STUDENTS TO SUCCEED. CSU FACULTY ARE MINDING THE GAP HERE. THE NEXT GAP HAS TO DO WITH GRADUATION RATES FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SUCH AS STUDENTS OF COLOR SO I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT HOW FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IS HELP. CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AS IN A PROFOUND DEVELOPER CALL VOLUME PRACTICES WERE HIPS. HIPS THINGS LIKE STUDY ABROAD SERVICE LEARNING INTERNSHIPS LEARNING COMMUNITIES AND THE LINK BETWEEN HIPS AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS CAN BE SEEN IN EXAMPLES LIKE CSU NORTHRIDGE WHO REPORT THAT LATINO STUDENTS ARE TEN PERCENT MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR PEERS. TO EARN A BACHELORS DEGREE IF THEY DO JUST ONE HIP AND IF THEY DO MORE THAN ONE THE EFFECT IS CUMULATIVE. BUT THERE'S A BIG HOBBY I HEAR QUALITY MATTERS AND FACULTY DEVELOPMENT MATTERS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE QUALITY. THERE WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH SAID OFFERING JUST OFFERING AND LABELING AND ACTIVITY AS A HIP. DOESN'T GUARANTEE STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT FROM IT WHAT IS EFFECTIVE IS SUPPORTING FACULTY DEVELOPMENT TO MAKE THEM HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCES AND THEN THEY CAN REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SO AGAIN REMINDING THE GAP ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT BY DEVOTING RESOURCES TO HELPING FACULTY DEVELOP HIGH QUALITY HIPS. WE'RE ALSO PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO COMPLETION GAPS WHAT WE WANNA SEE IS THAT WHEN A STUDENT ENTERS THE INNER CITY THAT PERSON. WHATEVER PAYS FOR THAT. WE'D RATHER NOT SEE THEM STOP AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T PERCEIVE ROB. SO WE LOOK FOR. YOU CAN PERSISTENCE RATES WHICH ULTIMATELY CLOSES COMPLETION GAPS. ONE KEY REASON WHY STUDENTS MIGHT NOT STICK WITH THEIR EDUCATION IS COST INCLUDING THE COST OF TEXTBOOKS. SO THERE FACULTY DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED THROUGH ACADEMIC TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES AND I'LL RUN THROUGH SOME OF THEM VERY QUICKLY. THE ACADEMIC TECHNOLOGY STE A SERVICES DIVISION IS DEVOTED AMONG OTHER THINGS TO SUPPORTING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE BLOCK BOXER Y.. TS FIRST INNING IN CONSULTING DISS THE LINE TOOLS CONFERENCES AND SO ON. YOU CAN SEE HERE A WHOLE SUITE OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR EACH ONE. ONE OF THE SIGNATURE RESOURCE FOR FACULTY OFFERED BY THE ANSWERS DOES IS THE CSU SUPPORT LEARNING SOLUTIONS A. L. OTHER SIGN PROGRAM. IT OFFERS FREE OR LOW COST DIGITAL TV RE PURSES TIGHTER CURATOR AT THE BEST LEVELS OF QUALITY OR MAINTAIN. JUST LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE PROGRAM A SAFE STUDENTS SINCE IT STARTED IN TWENTY TEN THE CSU ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL STUDENT SAVINGS ON TEXTBOOKS THROUGHOUT THE CSU HAS BEEN OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY. MILLION DOLLARS. KEY VENUE FOR A BIT AND HE'S OF ABILITY PRINCES PORTAL CALLED COOL FOR AN. NOTICE THE TOP THIS IMAGE IT HAS THE LOGO FOR ALL THREE SAID IT'S A PUBLIC HIGHER PATIENT. COOL FOR ED IS TRULY YOURS MENTAL EFFORT THE ACADEMIC SENATE'S OF COORDINATED FOR SEVERAL YEARS ON THIS PROJECT. IT'S PART OF AB SEVEN NINETY EIGHT WHICH ALLOCATED THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT ADOPTION OF OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES OR OR A ARE. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED IS ALMOST THERE ARE THOUSAND. STOOD IN COURT ACTIONS OF IT DID. ARE CLOSE TO FOUR HAVE MILLION DOLLAR WAS SAVED. IN ONE SEMESTER. SO I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ALL THREE SUSPECTS SEGMENT SENATE'S ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN REDUCING TEXT BECAUSE FOR STUDENTS BY INVOLVING OUR FACULTY. IN WAYS TO KEEP COLLEGE AFFORDABLE SO STUDENTS CAN PERSIST AND COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE. AT THIS POINT I HAVE TO EDIT MY REMARKS SO I'D ASK YOU TO SKIP SLIDE SIXTEEN THROUGH TWENTY TWO. ON THE WORK FORCE IN TENURE DENSITY GAPS AND A PICKUP WITH SLIDE TWENTY THREE WHICH IS TO FROM THE AND. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE EVERYTHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY COSTS MONEY BUT LEAVE THE LAST COUNT GONNA TALK ABOUT. THAT THE GAP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING WE. AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE NEED TO OPERATE. ALL OF THE INITIATIVES I'VE TALKED ABOUT ART FREE AND YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET BARELY COVERS A THIRD OF OUR NEED AND DOESN'T EVEN COVER OUR BASIC OUR MOST BASIC MANDATORY COSTS. IT ALSO DOESN'T FUND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH IS THE LYNCH PIN OF SO MUCH OF WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. WE BUILT UP A LOT OF MOMENTUM WITH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WITHOUT FULL FUNDING THAT MOMENTUM WILL BE STOPPED IN ITS TRACKS AND WILL GO BACKWARD COURTESY OF SIGNIFICANT CUTS FOR EVERY CAMPUS. THIS WOULD BE A TIME WHEN STATE RESERVES ARE HUGE IN THE RAINY DAY FUND THIS FALL IT A FIVE LOGIC. IT'S ALSO NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHERE THE MASTER PLAN COMES IN. THE MASTER PLAN IS A PERFECT FLEXIBLE BLUEPRINT FOR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. IT'S PROMISED ON A MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD EDUCATE ITS CITIZENRY. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH SEGMENT WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN IS TO FULFILL THE PUBLIC TRUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR MISSION. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE IN TURN IS TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT THE SEGMENTS NEED TO OPERATE WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN. SO FOR OUR PART WE'RE MINDING THE GAPS IN SKILLS ACHIEVEMENT COMPLETION WORKFORCE NEEDS AND YOUR DEAD BODY. BUT ALL WE DO IS ADVOCATE WHEN IT IS TO THE LINK OUT. WE NEED FUNDING TO CLOSE ALL THESE GAPS WE NEED FACULTY DEVELOPMENT TO CLOSE ALL THESE GAPS AND WE NEED ALL OF YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO MIND THE GAPS WITH US. BUT YOU THINK YOU PROFESSOR MILLER AND AND MEN TO PRACTICE TODAY'S ENTIRE HEARING BY SAYING. EVERYONE OF THESE PANELS COULD BE A TWO HOUR CONVERSATION. AND I WISH THEY WERE. ENFORCING WERE TRYING TO HIT FOUR PANELS INTO ONE HEARING. BUT IS REALLY VALUABLE FOR US TO START THE DIALOGUE AYE AND DEVELOP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL THE PANELISTS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JAMMING. A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION INTO INTO A SHORT PRESENTATION. BUT KNOW THAT THIS IS REALLY JUST THE THE START BUT WE HAVE REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW ALL IN ALL YOU'RE DOING TO PARTICIPATE TODAY AND I WAS NOT THE MOST IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES. PROFESSOR WHITE PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE FACULTY. OF THE SIX STATES DIFFERENTIATED RESEARCH UNIVERSITY THAT REWARDS. IRAQI CHEMICAL PROFESSIONAL DEGREES AND ALSO IN THE GROUND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OTHER SEGMENTS. AND IT DOES SO TO SERVE THE MOST DIVERSE STUDENT BODY IN ITS HISTORY. AT THE UC FACULTY DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES RELATED TO DIVERSITY TRANSFER STUDENT SUPPORT ATAGO GEE THAT MISSION ON NOT THINGS MANDATED EXTREMELY TO THE FACULTY. THERE ARE THINGS BETTER THAT A BIRTH STE ORGANICALLY FROM THE FACULTY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE STUDENTS. WHAT WE NEED? WHEN WE ARE COMMITTED THE UC'S PUBLIC MISSION WHERE HAVE IT. WE DO HAVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SUMMARIZE SOME OF THEM. I THINK WE COULD DO BETTER AND TO DEVELOP. SYSTEM. WIDE. TRANSPARENT CLEARINGHOUSE THAT WOULD HELP TO BETTER. SHARE THE RESOURCES TO HELP AN INCREASE IN DIVERSIFY REPRESENTATION. WE HAVE ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES BUT A FAR BIGGER CHALLENGE IS ONE MORE BASIC ONE. BOUT OF INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES. I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE A FEW REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLES OF. INITIATIVES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FACULTY OF VARIOUS FLAVORS. UNLIKE APPEARS WE HAVE A HIGHER PROPORTION. TENURE TRACK FACULTY NOT A RANK FACULTY AND A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION OF OUR COURSES ARE TAUGHT. OUR BY LATERITE TENURE TRACK FACULTY. WE ARE GUIDED BY SINGLE ACADEMIC PERSONNEL MANUAL THIS DEFINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FACULTY MEMBER AND THE UNIVERSITY. IT DOES NOT AS A CAREER MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR THE INDIVIDUAL LINKING THEIR LONG TERM CAREER LONG DEVELOPMENT. CONTRIBUTION DIRECTLY TO THE UNIVERSITY'S MISSION. YOU SEE UNIQUELY EMPLOYS RIGOROUS CAREER LONG POST TENURE. FACULTY REVIEW. YOU SEE FACULTY ARE HELD TO HIGH STANDARDS IN TEACHING AND RESEARCH. THE ACADEMIC SENATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DETERMINES ACADEMIC POLICY. ADMISSION ENROLLMENT RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES FROM FIRST JAN UNDERREPRESENTED. ENTRANCE FOR STUDENTS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH AND EIGHTEEN YOU TO STEM THE RISE. SPITE PROP TO A NINE. THESE EFFORTS A FOUNDATIONAL TO IMPROVING THE PIPELINE TO DIVERSIFY THE. THE STORY OF. UC'S HIGH GRADUATION RATES MEANS. HIGHER RETURNS ON ROMAN INVESTMENTS. NINE STUDENTS OUT OF EVERY TEN WILL AND DEGREE. THEY ARE PROUD OF OUR UNPARALLELED SUCCESS ADVANCING SOCIAL MOBILITY. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE ACADEMIC SENATE RECOMMENDED DIVERSITY STATEMENT THE BOARD OF REGENTS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY ADOPTED IT. MORE RECENTLY THE ACADEMIC SENATE INITIATED REVISION OF THE ACADEMIC PERSONNEL MANUAL TO READ. CONTRIBUTIONS IN ALL LEVELS OF FACULTY ACHIEVEMENT THE PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ADVERSITY SHOULD BE GIVEN DUE RECOGNITION. IN THE ACADEMIC PERSONNEL PROCESS IN THE MERIT REVIEW PROCESS IN THE PROMOTION PROCESS. THAT SHOULD BE EVALUATED AND CREDIT IS IN THE SAME WAY AS OTHER FACULTY ACHIEVEMENTS. DIVERSITY STATEMENTS ARE NOW SORT. OF ALL APPLICANTS TO FACULTY POSITIONS. PRESIDENT'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IS KEY TO SPORTING DIVERSIFICATION OF THE UC FACULTY. IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IT'S BEEN EMULATED ELSEWHERE NATIONWIDE AND WORLDWIDE. IT'S WAY TOO SMALL LAST YEAR WHO GREAT HUNDRED APPLICANTS I JUST TWENTY FOUR SLOTS. NORMAL ATTRITION END IN LIKE AND RENEWAL IS INSUFFICIENT TO MOVE THE. NEEDLE ON DIVERSIFYING THE FACULTY FAST ENOUGH WE NEED TO DO MORE. IN MY OPINION GREATLY IMAGINING. THE PRESIDENT'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW PROGRAM WOULD REALLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE WE GOTTA DO THAT. THE BOARD OF ADMISSIONS AND RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS WE CALL IT POOREST. I IS AN ACADEMIC SENATE COMMITTEE. IT REGULATES THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF ADMISSION TO THE YOU SEE. ONE CURRENT EXAMPLE OF BOARDS ENGAGEMENT IS THE WORK TO IMPLEMENT. THE BRAND BICU TRANSFERRED GUARANTEE OF ADMISSION TO THE UC SYSTEM THAT'S BUILT UPON THE TWENTY ONE TRANSFER PATHWAYS INITIATED BY THE FACULTY. TO INCENTIVIZE AND REWARD GOOD ACADEMIC PREPARATION WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO FULFILL A MASTER PLAN TRANSFER OBLIGATIONS. THE STATE PROGRAM. A DAVIS STRENGTH TO EQUITY AND DIVERSITY USES TRAIN FACULTY MEMBERS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ADVICE ABOUT ACHIEVING. EXCELLENCE EQUITY AND RECIPIENT FACULTY RECRUITMENT. ALL CAMPUSES HAVE SIMILAR PROGRAMS. TRAINING BY ANY PARTICIPANT IN A FACULTY RECRUITMENT COMMITTEE OF FACULTY SEARCH COMMITTEE. A IS A REQUIREMENT TO SERVE AND. THAT WAY. IN PEDAGOGY WE HAVE THE INNOVATIVE LEARNING TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE OR I'LL TI. SYSTEM WIDE EFFORT SUPPORTING FACULTY TO HARNESS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ONLINE AND HYBRID MODELS TO ASSIST YOU SEE STUDENTS. I BY HELPING THEM ACCESS ITEM ON COURSES SATISFIED REAL REQUIREMENTS GRADUATE ON TIME IT'S PROVIDED HARD AND SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE TO CAMPUSES. PROVIDED A SYSTEM WIDE ACROSS CAMPUS IN ROMAN SYSTEM. I AT SEARCHABLE DATABASE OF STUDENTS CAN FIND THE COURSES THEY NEED. AND IT'S FUNDED DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL HUNDRED COURSES AROUND THE SYSTEM OF COURSE EVERY CAMPUS HAS ITS OWN. ONLY CAMPUS GROWN EFFORTS THAT WORK IN SYNC WITH I'LL T. I. REMEDIATION GENERALLY IF YOU SEE WE DO NOT OFFER REMEDIAL COURSES INSTEAD WE DO THINK TWO THINGS MORE IMPORTANT I THINK IN BETTER ONE IS WE TRY TO ENSURE. THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE EXCELLENT PREPARATION COMING IN EXAMPLE WOULD BE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO CREATE AND UPDATE THE ATG CURRICULUM. ANOTHER ONE WOULD BE THE ENTRY LEVEL WRITING REQUIREMENT YELL W. ARE. SO WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS ARE WELL PREPARED TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WHEN THEY ARISE. IF THEY'RE NOT INSTEAD OF SAYING STOP AND HOLDING THEM UP. UP FOR REMEDIATION WE DO SOMETHING ELSE. WE DO. HAVE A COLLEGE LEVEL INTENSIVE COURSES. IN THOSE RELATED AREAS THAT THEY WILL TAKE FOR CREDIT AND PROGRESS. SO THAT IS. ARE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO REMEDIATION. YOU SEE FACULTY DON'T JUST DRIVE OUR OWN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BUT. WE. GENERATE. MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FACULTY OF OUR OWN UC AND CSU SYSTEMS. I HAVE ANOTHER THIRTY OR SO EXAMPLES IN THE LONGER WRITTEN HANDOUT. WHAT CAN WE DO? ALL THE LOW HANGING FRUIT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PICKED THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT WE CAN DO THAT WON'T REQUIRE MORE FUNDING. OUR REAL PROBLEM IS. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIO. IT STEADILY WORSENED OVER THE LAST DECADES. WE USE THE WHERE APPEARS THERE A DECADE AGO ONE NOT ANY MORE WE'VE LEFT FAR BEHIND. SLIDE DIRECTLY CONNECTS THE WORSENING OUR FACULTIES RATIO. WITH A DIM. I MEAN. IN STATE FUNDING. THINGS ARE TO PLEASE RELATED INESCAPABLE. SLIDE SHOWS A DECREASE INC FUNDS FROM THE STATE OR LAST THIRTY YEARS. THIS SLIDE SHOWS. ONE PERCENT DECREASE IN FULL BATTLE RISKY. IN THIS PLENTY OF. THIS IS ONLY IN SCHOOL BEING WRONG. WE HAVE FACULTY ENGAGEMENT IN GOVERNANCE AND IN DEVELOPMENT FACULTY ARE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATES. IT'S PART OF OUR EXPECTED BUTTONS IT'S NECESSARY FOR OUR SMALL. THE SUPPORT YOU CAN SEE IN THE WAY IS THAT WE DEVELOP OUR FACULTY. WE WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR SEGMENT CSU IN THE CCC. MASTER PLAN HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN LA EACH SEGMENT EFFECT THE AND THE LEAST DISCUSSED. MUCH TO A PARTNER. CCC AND CO TWO SYSTEMS. MASTER PLAN CAN USED TO SERVE WELL THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. STATE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS FALLEN SHORT BY MANY METRICS. NOTABLY FUNDING PER STUDENT AND STUDENT FACULTY RATIO. SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT AND STUDENTS SUPPORTER CONSTRAINED BY STEADILY WORSENING STUDENT FACULTY RATIO METRIC FOR BROAD ACADEMIC TEACHING RESEARCH AND SERVICE QUALITY. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MUSIC STRANDS ALL OF THOSE THINGS REVERSING THIS TREND MUST BE KEY PRIORITY STATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROFESSOR Y. IT. AND DOCTOR CLOTS. THANK YOU. I JUST WANNA INTRODUCE MYSELF BRIEFLY SO NOT ONLY AM I A RESEARCHER AND SOMEONE WHO WORKS ON POLICY AT THE CENTER FOR URBAN EDUCATION. I BUT I WAS A TEACHER FOR TEN YEARS AND SO I THOUGHT BOTH IN THE UC SYSTEM AS A GRADUATE INSTRUCTOR FOR SIX YEARS AT UC DAVIS. UP AND THEN I MOVED TO BUTTE COLLEGE WHICH IS IN THE NORTH STATE IN BUTTE COUNTY. I'M WHERE I TAUGHT BOTH TRANSFER LEVEL IN BASIC SKILLS ENGLISH COURSES FOR THREE YEARS. SO ALL OF MY COMMENTS ABOUT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT I HOPE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BRING THOSE THREE PIECES TOGETHER WHAT WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH WHAT WE SAY ABOUT POLICY. AND ALSO WHAT THE PRACTICE OF BEING A FACULTY MEMBER IN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY LIKE. I'M SO IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE SPEAKING WITH A SELECT COMMITTEE TODAY. I WHEN I WORK COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA OFTEN TELL THE STORY WE OWE OUR HER. AYE WHO'S ONE OF THE KEY ARCHITECTS OF THE MASTER PLAN I'M GONNA BE ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A KILLJOY ABOUT THE THE MASTER PLAN RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF MY ROLE AS A RESEARCHER AND A SCHOLAR. SO HE WAS THINKING BACK ON DEVELOPING THE MASTER PLAN HE WROTE AN ARTICLE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN YEARS AFTER THE MASTER PLAN WAS WRITTEN THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS. HE CONSIDERS IN RETROSPECT THE VAST EXPANSION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AS AN INSTITUTION OF INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC RENOWNED WHAT IF YOU MEAN BY THIS. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE PERSISTENT OPPORTUNITY GAPS IN OUR STATE'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THAT IDEA OF THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. IT MEANS THAT THE MASTER PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO BLOCK THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS FROM ENTRY INTO THE HIGHEST SOCIAL GOODS PROVIDED BY HIGHER EDUCATION. IN THE WORDS OF EDWARDS DEMING EVERY SYSTEM IS PERFECTLY DESIGNED TO TO GET THE RESULTS THAT IT GET. AND TODAY THOSE RESULTS HAVE RACIAL IMPLICATION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATIN NEXT NATIVE AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER STUDENTS MATRICULATING CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE STUDENTS ARE SUBJECT A DISPROPORTIONATE REMEDIATION AND THEY COMPLETE DEGREES CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER GOALS AT LOWER RATES THAN THEIR WHITE AND ASIAN PEERS. AT THE CENTER FOR URBAN EDUCATION OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THESE EQUITY GAP ARE BUBBLE OF. ACCESS NOT A PROBLEM IF THE ABILITIES OR THE POTENTIAL OF THESE STUDENTS. SO HOW DO WE IMPROVE PRACTICE I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR CENTER IS DOING IN THE AREA OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. TO ENSURE THAT OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS ARE SERVING MINORITY HIGHS RACIAL STUDENT GROUPS EQUITABLY. FACULTY ARE SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS ARE PROFESSIONAL IDENTITIES DERIVED FOR MANY YEARS OF ENCULTURATION INTO OUR ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. DESPITE EXPERTS THAT WE GAIN AS I MET SOCIOLOGISTS HIS REAR. BUT RARELY TRAINED IN THE KEY COMPETENCIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SERVE STUDENTS AN EQUITABLE WAYS. THE MOST IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY AREA EXPERTISE IS INSUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN HIGHER EDUCATION TODAY. AS FACULTY WE NEED TO BECOME. INSTITUTIONAL EMPOWER MENT AGES FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. THIS MEANS LEARNING TO TEACHING CULTURALLY SUSTAINING REYES TO BUILD HIGHER LEVELS OF EQUITY MINDED DATA LITERACY TO UNDERSTAND OUR OUTCOMES DATA. AND TO INTERROGATE ARE TAKEN FORGET GRANTED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THE BLOCK AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATIN NEXT NATIVE AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER STUDENTS FROM EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. GIVEN THE SHORT TIME THAT WE HAVE TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST ONE AREA WHERE CENTER IS LEADING PROFESSIONAL LEARNING. EQUITY IN FACULTY HIRING. RATHER THAN PROVIDING BEST PRACTICES WE FOCUS ON BEST PRACTITIONERS. WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE HIGH LEVELS OF CONTEXT SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAT FACULTY POSSESS. AND PRIDE BRIEF ARTICLE FOR FACULTY TO LOOK INTO THAT OWN BEST. IF YOU CAN ONGOING LEARNING PROCESS PROFESSION EXPAND. IT IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT FACULTY HIRING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUT OF STEP WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN STUDENT IDENTITIES IN OUR STATE. I QS BUILDING CAPACITY FOR FACULTY TO IDENTIFY HOW RACIAL BIAS IS KEEPING FACULTY REPRESENTATION STATIC. THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT SHOWING THAT DISPARITIES BETWEEN STUDENTS BACKGROUNDS AND THE PROFESSIONALS TEACHERS AND LEADERS THEY ENCOUNTER THEIR. CAMP SAYS SO IT SLIDE YOU CAN III AT THE UNDERGRADUATE DEMOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION IN THE STATE. IN THIS SLIDE YOU CAN SEE THE DEMOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THE PROFESSIONALS IN HIGHER EDUCATION BETTER CURRENT WORKING IN OUR FIELD. THE PAST SMUDGED THREE OF WHOM ARE WE. WHY DIVERSITY IN OUR CURRENT FACT AND CURB THE STEREOTYPE THREAT EXPERIENCED BY STUDENTS OF COLOR? FACULTY OF COLOR ENHANCE THE SENSE OF BELONGING THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR CAN FEEL ON CAMPUS. THEY PROMOTE POSITIVE AND CURB NEGATIVE SOCIAL OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND FACULTY OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO ADVOCATE FOR AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH. DO YOU HAVE NOW COULD IN OVER FORTY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO LOOK INTO THEIR FACULTY HIRING PROCESS YOU. TEAMS OF TEN LOOK AT DATA ABOUT HOW CANDIDATES PROCEED THROUGH THE HIRING PROCESS AND THEY ARE NOT BY THE PRECISE POINTS WHEN A POOL BECOMES LESS DIVERSE. THEY LOOK INTO THE LANGUAGE OF THEIR JOB ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SEE HOW THEIR COLLEGE IS PRESENTING THEIR VALUES AROUND RACIAL EQUITY TO POTENTIAL HIRES. THE TEAMS WORK TOGETHER TO LEARN ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS AND TO BUILD INTERPERSONAL STRATEGIES TO DISRUPT EXPLICIT BIAS WHEN IT EMERGES IN HIRING COMMITTEE MEETING. WE ARE ALREADY SEEING WIDESPREAD CHANGES AND JOB ANNOUNCEMENTS USED ACROSS THE STATE AFTER ONE YEAR OF ENGAGING IN THIS IMPORTANT WORK. THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR METHODOLOGY FOR FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WE CONVENE FACULTY FROM ACROSS CAMPUS AREAS TO ENGAGE DEEPLY AND DISCUSSIONS OF RACIAL EQUITY. THEY BECOME RESEARCHERS INTO THEIR OWN PRACTICE AND CHANGE AGENTS WILLING TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR RACIALLY MINORITY HIGH STUDENTS. TO CONCLUDE I WONDER RESTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF FACULTY DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE OF THEIR SUBJECT AREAS. THE STATE SHOULD BE FUNDING MORE PROGRAMMING FOR FACULTY TO COME TOGETHER AND LEARN HOW TO BRING CRITICAL RACE CONSCIOUSNESS INTO THEIR PRACTICE. ONE ACTION THE STATE CAN TAKE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE FUNDING IS TO SHIFT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE USE AROUND ACHIEVEMENT VERSES OPPORTUNITY GAPS. WE CANNOT BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT IN ACHIEVEMENT GAP UNTIL WE ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS DO HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHER EDUCATION. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE STOP TALKING ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AS A PROBLEM OF STUDENT MOTIVATION OR STUDENT PREPARATION. AND INSIST IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE THE SOURCE OF THE INEQUITIES THAT WE ARE SEEING. THIS REFRAMING HAS CHIU BENEFITS THE FIRST IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND ATTEMPT TO CORRECT. MANY CENTURIES OF GOVERNMENT SPONSORED EDUCATIONAL INJUSTICE FROM JIM CROW SEGREGATION TO NATIVE AMERICAN BOARDING SCHOOLS FOR LANGUAGE ERADICATION. THE SECOND BENEFIT IS TO RE FRAME EDUCATIONAL INEQUITY AS A PROBLEM OF PRACTICE WITHIN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF OUR FACULTY. A PROBLEM WITH A SOLUTION. THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THROUGH REFLECTION AND PROFESSIONAL LEARNING. WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF A JUST AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM WITHOUT DISMANTLING OUR EUPHEMISTIC LANGUAGE AROUND RACIAL INJUSTICE. CHALLENGING OUR MYTHS OF MERITOCRACY AND RETHINKING THE TAKEN FOR GRANTED PRACTICES OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THANK YOU. BUT. THANK YOU DOCTOR CLIENTS AND FOR EVERYBODY HERE TODAY AND ANYBODY WATCHING. ONLINE LATER ON ALL THE MATERIALS ALL THE SLIDES THAT. FOLKS OF PRESENTED TODAY IS GONNA BE AVAILABLE ON MY WEBSITE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN A JOB DOWN MENU FOR FOLKS IF THEY WANT IN THE FUTURE. I WOULD THAT I WANT TO WELCOME MY COLLEAGUE DR WEBER. WHO JOINED US? AS SOON AFTER WE STARTED TODAY. THEN YOU GIVE HER A CHANCE TO SAY THE OPENING WORDS I SHOULD LIKE OR WE CAN JUST GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE Q. IN A BECAUSE I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN TAKEN LONG NOTES. AND OFFER THEM SPEAK TO A LOT OF THESE ISSUES BEFORE AND I KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF FUNDS. SO I'LL START OFF WITH ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN. WELL THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS DUH LOT OF THE INFORMATION LOT OF THOUGHT PROVOKING. INFORMATION PRESENTED. AS THE CHAIR SAID MANY OF THIS ISSUES WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IN SACRAMENTO. AND I. WOOD JUMPS IN A LOT JUMPS OUT AT ME OF THE LACK OF FUNDING OF THE STATE. AND THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE LACK OF FUNDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE CHANGE IN THE RATIO OF STUDENTS TO FACULTY. A WHEN I WAS A STUDENT HERE BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WE WERE A. I CAMPUS OF SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS AND THAT WE HAD A AYE I'M SURE A GREAT RATIO OF. A STUDENTS TO FACULTY WAS ABLE I WAS ABLE AS A STUDENT TO REALLY GET TO KNOW. ON MY FACULTY HERE AND I THINK THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THE SAME. AND THE EXPERIENCE. I'M SURE IT IS DIFFERENT OF WHEN WHEN THE IT STUDENT RATIO TO FACULTY IS A SO MUCH HIGHER. I AND AND I WILL. YOU KNOW TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. A FOR THIS UNIT FOR THE STATE. I CAN'T. I'VE SAID BEFORE WE CAN'T TAKA AT BOTH ENDS OF OUR OF OUR MOUTHS AND YOU KNOW. CRITICIZE CRITICIZE WHILE NOT FUNDING SO THAT THAT IS A TAKEN. AYE I AM VERY. TAKING NOTES. PROFESSOR. CLOCKS NO IT'S NOT CORRECTLY UP WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THAT WE GET THE SYSTEMS THAT. WE. HELP ME HERE THAT WE THAT WE DECIDE THAT WE DESIGN. A WE HAD A HEARING ON. OF FACULTY DIVERSITY AT SAN JOSE STATE AND I'LL REPEAT THE. STATEMENT MADE BY UC FACULTY ASTRONOMER DISTINGUISHED FACULTY WHO SAID THAT WE DON'T NOT HAVE THE DIVERSITY ON AND HIGHER EDUCATION. UP BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO. WAS THE STATEMENT HE SAID. THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE ARE LAUDABLE. MANY OF THEM. HERE AT UC RIVERSIDE CLUSTER HIRING. THE STATEMENT. A PROFESSOR THAT YOU MENTIONED THE STATEMENT OF OUR DIVERSITY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO TEACH. DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION REQUIRING THAT DIVERSITY STATEMENT AS PART OF THE APPLICATION. I MENTION IN SACRAMENTO CLUSTER HIRING THAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE AT UC RIVERSIDE. I KNOW THAT. CHANCELLOR WILCOX WAS ABLE TO HIRE A BELIEVES SEVEN NATIVE AMERICANS FACULTY IN THE LAST YEAR SO LOTS OF VERY LAUDABLE THINGS. HOWEVER. I WOULD POINT OUT. GOING OUT TO A DOCUMENTARY THAT I SAW RECENTLY THAT GOES BACK FIFTY YEARS. FIFTY YEARS TO BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. WHEN STUDENTS AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. UNIVERSITY. STUDENTS AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY IN VERY UNCERTAIN TERMS. A PROTESTER. FOR THE SAME THINGS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FIFTY YEARS LATER. LACK OF. AMONG IN IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SO I AS AS MUCH AS I APPLIED ALL SEGMENTS FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. AND CONTINUING WORK AND THE GREAT PROGRAMS. SOME OF WHICH ARE ARE GOING TO BE UNDER FUNDED. THIS YEAR. PROGRAM OF THE POST DOCTORAL. AS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IS IS GONNA BE CUT IN HALF THIS YEAR WHERE IT RECEIVED MAYBE TWO MILLION IT WOULD RECEIVE. ONE MILLION THIS YEAR AND THESE PROGRAMS COST MONEY WHY ARE WE. NOW GONNA UNDER FUND. EVERY YEAR AND WE HAVE WITH US A SUBPOENA CONTROLLER EVERY YEAR WE FIGHT TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE WE KNOW ARE WORKING PROGRAMS LIKE WEDNESDAY AND MESS. WE FIGHT EVERY YEAR TO KEEP FUNDING THEM. SO I I I AM. YOU KNOW I I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT WORDS TO SAY DID THE THAT THE FIGURES AS WELL IF WE LOOK AT THE PROGRESSION OF A DIVERSE FACULTY HIRING. SPECIALLY WITH WITHIN UC. ARE FLAT. OUR FLAT. IT WE LIVED FROM YEAR TO YEAR GOING BACK FORTY FIFTY YEARS. AYE. SHARED WITH A DOCTOR WEBER THAT IN THE FALL I INTEND TO HAVE A HEARING SPECIFICALLY. ON THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN UC BECAUSE I I THINK WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT FOR THREE FOUR HOURS. AND THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO IN THE FALL COME BACK TO YOU SEE ARE TO HAVE. A AYE HEARING ON THE LACK OF DIVERSITY FACULTY IN UC. A BUT THANK YOU ALL TO. TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND. CERTAINLY THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK WITH US TO SACRAMENTO. I WANNA. ALL FOR. I KNOW. AND. WILL BE NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FIRST WON'T APOLOGIZE OF STUCK IN A TRAFFIC ADDED NO THE JUST THE BOTTLE NICK OF TIME. RATE. YOU SO CLOSE YOU COULD SEE IT BUT YOU CAN'T GET THERE ONE OF THOSE KIND OF REALITIES. BUT. YOU I'M I APPRECIATE BEING HERE THIS MORNING AND. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT I I SPENT FORTY YEARS AS A PROFESSOR OF AFRICANA STUDIES IT'S ENABLE STATE UNIVERSITY OF THE FOUNDER OF AFRICAN STUDIES. AND A BOOK WITH WILL PROFESSOR AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. ARE AND. CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY. AFTER MY RETIREMENT IT'S AN EAGLE STATE WHERE CONTINUE TO. REALLY WORK IN AND DO INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS I'M OUT OF WORK WITH THE SEVERAL OF YOU OVER THE YEARS IN TERMS OF THE ONGOING STRUGGLE. OF WHAT IS PRESENT. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BRING A CHANGE TO THE SYSTEM. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I'M PLEASED THAT THE. THAT THE ACADEMIC THE CHEERS OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE ARE HERE ON THIS PANEL BECAUSE. YOU PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DETERMINING OUR WHAT HAPPENS UP OUR OWN ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES IN THE SYSTEMS THAT I APPRECIATE. DR KLOTZ'S OP COMMENTS BECAUSE AS WE MADE OUR EFFORTS AT THE UNIVERSE AT THE AT THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO BRING CHANGE WERE OFTEN. CONFRONTED WITH THE WITH THE IDEA OF THE NOTION THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE RUN BY THE FACULTY. THAT IS A FACULTIES WILL WITH THE PUT TALKING DIVERSITY AND FACULTY THE TALKING CHANGING CURRICULUM. AT THE TALKING A REQUIREMENTS OF ETHNIC STUDIES OF ALL STUDENTS TO A COME TO THE UNIVERSITY. OF WHERE I AND AND AS A LEGISLATURE THOSE ARE THINGS WE CAN WORK ON A TRIP AND MANDATE WERE OFTEN. CONFRONTED WITH THE NOTION OF WHAT WORLDS OFTENTIMES MIS USE OF THE WORD ACADEMIC FREEDOM WHICH IS NOT WHAT THAT'S ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHY IT TO CLARIFY THAT RECENTLY BUT THE NOTION THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE COLEGIO INSTITUTIONS AND THEY ARE. THAT ARE RUN BY FACULTY. THAT THE ISSUES OF CURRICULUM AND HIRING AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS GOAL TO THE FACULTY. I AND HAVING BEEN IN THAT SYSTEM IN THOSE POSITIONS OF PERSONAL. OWN PERSONAL COMMITTEES AND WHAT HAVE BEEN HIRING THINGS THAT IS TRUE. SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS CHEERS OF THESE ACADEMIC IS SENATE'S WHICH EVERYBODY PAYS HOW MUCH DO. I SERVE IN ACADEMICS AND SO I DON'T PAY AS MUCH HOW MUCH AS EVERYBODY ELSE. IT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS I CAN REMEMBER LAW PART OF MY. SEEM LIKE ON ACADEMIC SENATE. SO WHAT DO YOU. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS OTHER THAN FUNDING BECAUSE AT DEFINING WHAT THE KEY I'D PROBABLY GO FIND THE MONEY FOR YOU BUT? WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE KEY TO? CHANGING THE DYNAMICS. OF ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE ISSUE OF HIRING AND RESEARCH WAS EVEN THOUGH WE CAN SAY. THE ACTIVITIES YOU ENGAGE IN FOR DIVERSITY OR WHATEVER SHOULD COUNT LIKE THE OTHERS. ANYBODY IN ITS INSTITUTION KNOWS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WORDS. BUT IN THOSE PERSONNEL COMMITTEES WHAT I'VE SAID. I PEOPLE SAY YES IT'S WONDERFUL THAT THEY'VE GONE OUT AND AND RESCUE ALL THESE KIDS OF THEIR WORKING WITH THEM IN THERE HELPING THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL HOWEVER. THEY SHOULD OF DONE ONE MORE ARTICLE. AND SO THEY DID TO THE GUY WHO DID NOTHING THE A THREE. AND THE THREE GETS PROMOTED INTO A NEED AND A TWO PERSON GETS A A A SAY YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET ENOUGH ARTICLE AND BLAH BLAH BLAH AND SO. IN SOME SMALL WAY. AND WHICH IS REALLY LARGE OF THE EMPHASIS IS IS SAID AND IN MANY WAYS IT THIS IS UNIMPORTANT IN THE REAL WORLD. AND THE WORLD OF TENURE PROMOTION AND RESOURCES WORKING WITH THESE POPULATIONS IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT. IT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COUNT IN IN IN TERMS OF HOUSEHOLDS CAN. FOLKS IN WHO THEY CELEBRATE WITH A LOT WHEN THEY BECOME THE DEAN WHO BECOMES WHATEVER ELSE THAT USED TO BE WE KNOW WHO GETS THAT SO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT. AS YOU FOLKS ARE. SHARES OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE. WHICH ACCORDING TO AND BEING TOLD VALUE PRESIDENTS AND CHANCELLORS THAT IF YOU FOLKS SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN. THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL US WHICH I KNOW THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE EITHER BUT WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WHAT DO I MEAN WHAT CAN WE DO TO CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC BECAUSE EVERYBODY KIND OF SHIFTS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE. NO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO FIGURING OUT HOW YOU GONNA MOVE THESE INSTITUTIONS TO TO REALLY OPEN UP TO THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS WERE HERE. AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA ARE WHAT WHAT WHAT. IF THERE WAS ONE THING YOU COULD THINK ABOUT THAT WOULD CHANGE IT WHAT WOULD IT BE SINCE. LIKE I SAID YOU GUYS AT YEARS OF ACADEMIC SENATE. WELL. THANK YOU I WISH THAT WE DID HAVE THE POWER THAT YOU THOUGHT AND YOU HAVE. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS OF SERVICE. I I SEE A A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ONE IS IT'S A CHICKEN AND EGG SITUATION. WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER WITH THE PIPELINE. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY. FUNDAMENTAL. WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE PERFECT STORY AT MACADAM THE THAT REPRESENTS AND IS REFLECTIVE OF THE PEOPLE. THE GETTING THERE. IS THE HARD BIT. WE HAVE SAID WHAT WE WANT WE HAVE SAID WHAT OUR IDEALS ARE WE HAVE ENCODED. IN OUR PRACTICES THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY. WE'VE GOT THAT IN THE APPLICANT HAVING IT RISKY STATE. WE'VE GOT ABOUT IN OUR. APPRAISAL OF THE APPLICANT. I THINK WHAT PROFESSOR CLARK SAID IS. WE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND THAT WE ARE THE PROBLEM. I BELIEVE WE DO BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN MAKING THOSE CHANGES. TO OURSELVES. SO IT'S A CHICKEN AND EGG. WE GO TO BREAK THE CYCLE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A BETTER PIPELINE. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT. THE FACULTY SENATE MAY GET TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION. WHO MAKE THE HIGHER? WE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ADMINISTRATOR MAKES THE HIGHER. SO THE LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS WHETHER IT SENATORS OR ADMINISTRATIVE. DEAN OR CHANCELLOR HAS GOT TO LIVE THAT. TO. SO I GUESS IN A WAY. I'M NOT PASSING THE BUCK BUT I'M SHARING IT. A WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. I WOULD ALSO SAY WE GOT ANOTHER EXAMPLE. AT UC. OUR STUDENT BODY AS LONG. IN WAITED TOWARDS FEMALE GENDER. BUT. BUT THE NEXT STEP GRAD SCHOOL WE LOSE SOME OF THAT AT THE NEXT STEP POSTDOC WE LOSE SOME OF THAT. AT THE NEXT STEP FACULTY WE DO SOME OF THAT. NOW WE HAVE. BABY FOR PRESIDENT LAST YEAR WE HAD. A LADY AS PROVOST. WE HAVE. TWO LADIES AS COUNSELORS. WE'RE GETTING THROUGH THAT. BUT WE'VE GOT TO. RIGHT THIS THING AND IT'S A CHICKEN AND EGG THING. IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO DO BUT I REALLY SEE THE PIPELINE. WE'VE GOT TO PUT OUR RESOURCES INTO THAT PIPELINE. I HOPE I'M HELPING. YOU CONTEXT AND ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. YOU ARE. GOOD COULD I FOLLOW UP ON AYE AYE REFERENCE THE YEAR NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. SINCE THEN. NO DOCTOR WEBER. I HAVE GOT THROUGH. GOT HER DOCTORATE AT UCLA. THERE ARE MANY MORE LIKER. WHO GRADUATED AND GOT THEIR DOCTORATES FROM OUR INSTITUTIONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA? SO IS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE NUMBER OF. QUALIFY. FOLKS WITH WITH P. H. D.'S HAVE VASTLY INCREASED. OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. BUT STILL THE NUMBER OF FACULTY REMAIN. THE SAME SO I I I I I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WANTING TO TO. INCREASE THE PIPELINE BUT I WAS A STUDENT HERE. AND I I GOT MY MASTERS HERE. I I ACTUALLY. BEGAN THE SKI HD PROGRAM HERE IN HISTORY AND I HAVE. AND HAD A LOTS OF FRIENDS. WHO LOOK LIKE ME? YOU KNOW SOME OF WHOM WENT ON TO FINISH THEIR P. H. D.'S. SOME OF WHOM ARE TENURED. IN IN DEPARTMENTS OF HISTORY HAD AT IRVINE. OF BUT NOT ENOUGH. SO I I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT JUST BE KNOW. FIFTY YEARS AGO WE WERE SAYING THE SAME THING. WE WERE ST FIFTY YEARS AGO THAT THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH. BUT BUT THERE HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER HAS HAD TO HAVE INCREASED. AND IN THE IN THE POOL AS THEY SAY. I'M CAN I SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THAT THE PIPELINE QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WORKING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO I KNOW THAT THAT THE UC IS OF COURSE A VERY DIFFERENT CONTACTS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU WE HEAR THE SAME EXACT ARGUMENTS EVERY TIME WE SPEAK TO FACULTY FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES ABOUT WHY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M HAVE A SUCH A VAST MAJORITY OF WHITE FACULTY THAT HAS NOT BUDGED IN ANY SUBSTANTIAL WAY IN THESE YEARS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ON AND WHAT SO WHAT WE DID OUR CENTER IS WE WENT AND WE FOUND IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO MEETS THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS WHO IS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN LATIN NEXT PACIFIC ISLANDER. AN ASIAN AMERICAN IN THE STATE FROM THE CS YOU AND THAT YOU SEE SYSTEM. SO WE ACTUALLY CREATED A POCKET FOR ALL OF OUR FACULTY TO SHOW THIS IS YOUR POOL AND IT'S ACTUALLY A MASSIVE POOL SO THEY HEARD SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS GOING ON. ARE YOU IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WHERE THE REQUIREMENT TO TEACH IS A MASTER'S DEGREE. ARE YOU GOING FOR THAT WHITE CANDIDATE WITH THE PHD AND IF YOU ARE DEAD Y.. WHAT ARE THE WAYS YOU NEED TO REPHRASE? YOUR NOTION OF MERIT SO THAT YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY FULFILLING THE NEEDS OF YOUR STUDENTS. I'D LIKE TO JUST CHIME IN I FIGURED YOUR SPOT ON AND AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS AT LEAST FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE. WHEN YOU LOST ME ON THE ARTICLES FOR TENURE AND ALL THAT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FOR US. ARM AND IS ABOUT THE TEACHER RIGHT AND WE ARE COLLEGES OF OF TEACHING. SO I THINK REALLY THE CONVERSATION IT HAS TO BE A MORAL IMPERATIVE. IT HAS TO BE THE IDEA THAT THIS IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE AND SO WE HAVE GOT TO START EXAMINING OUR PROCESS SEIZE WE'VE GOT TO REDUCE THOSE BARRIERS WE HAVE GOT TO THAT POOL IS OUT THERE. AND WE HAVE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHY WERE NOT RECRUITING APPLE HOWEVER NOT RECRUITING THAT PULL TO GET IN SO THAT WE WIDEN. THAT PULL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE HIRING THOSE THAT ARE READY TO MEET OUR STUDENTS AND AND AND THAT'S REALLY. WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I DO I DO THINK ALSO THERE HAS TO BE THIS CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT WE TALK ABOUT TEACHING AND LEARNING AND PEDAGOGY? AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO CRITICAL PEDAGOGY AND AND AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AMONGST OURSELVES AND I THINK THAT'S WHY RELEASED WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING. FOR FACULTY IN THE COMMUNICATIVE JUST. WE NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS TO CONFRONT. OUR COLLEAGUES AND OUR PRACTICES AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET RID OF. THE STUFF THAT IS NOT SERVING OUR STUDENTS AND REALLY FOCUS ON WHERE WE NEED TO SERVE THEM. AND SO THAT. THAT TAKES TIME AND IT TAKES ON SPACE TO DO AND SO I THINK REALLY IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT. AND AND AND JUST CREATE THAT SPACE AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY STARTING TO I THINK THE WORK. THAT AND Q. IS DOING I THINK THE WORK THAT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THE ACADEMIC SENATE SO I THINK THE WORK THEY WERE DOING AROUND THE GUIDED PATHWAYS AWARD PROGRAM. IS ACTUALLY PART OF THAT IS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ARE WE CREATING AS BARRIERS. BUT. IT IT IT'S IT HAS TO BE AN INSTITUTION WIDE AND BECAUSE OUR COLLEGES OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED INSTITUTIONS THAT WORK IS FOR THEM TO REALLY DIGGIN INTO. BUT I TAKE MISTER MEDINA'S POINT IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS WE'VE HAD THAT MORAL IMPERATIVE EVEN BACK THEN IS WHAT'S NOT THE MERE MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT'S CHANGED. I WOULD SAY WHAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIFTY YEARS AGO AND NOW IS WHETHER WE CAN BE MORE INTENTIONAL ABOUT IT. AND INTENTIONALITY A LOT OF THE RIVER THE THINGS THAT DRIVE FACULTY IS DATA. WE HAVE DATA DASHBOARDS NOW THAT WE NEVER HAD BACK FIFTY YEARS AGO WE HAVE THE DATA LIKE THE THE THE. THAT SLIDES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TODAY THAT SHOW THE FOR THE THE SITUATION AND WE CAN POINT TO THAT RATHER THAN ANECDOTES. WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT THAT STUDENTS TELL US I SUCCEED BETTER WHEN I SEE SOMEONE LIKE ME UP IN FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM AND THAT'S IT ANECDOTES. WHEN WE CAN WHEN WE CAN TAKE DATA AND PUT IT TO THOSE ANECDOTES IT GIVES US MORE AMMUNITION TO BE INTENTIONAL. AND ONCE WE CAN GET INTENTIONAL ABOUT IT WE CAN REWARD. SO WE CAN REMOVE THEM FROM A REWARDING FOR INSTANCE PUBLICATIONS TO RIP TO REWARDING HOW MANY STUDENTS OF COLOR HAVE YOU HELPED THIS YEAR. THAT KIND OF THING WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY NOW BEGIN TO TRACK IT AND AND HOPEFULLY BEGIN TO REWARDED SO THE MORAL IMPERATIVE IS STILL THERE AND I THINK IT'S IT'S STRONG. IT JUST NEEDS TO HAVE SOME BACKING TO IT NOW WITH THE REWARD STRUCTURE IN MORE INTENTIONALITY. I'D I'D I THINK YOU YOU YOU. I THINK CLEARLY INTENTIONALITY IS CRITICAL BECAUSE. IF YOU DON'T MAKE THAT YOUR GOAL. A TO DO YOU WON'T NEED IT BECOMES NO MORE THAN OPEN STATEMENTS. AND I THINK ALSO WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IN AND I'M SURE YOU DO. WHY IS IT THAT THOSE WHO COME DON'T STAY SOMETIMES? IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE THE FACT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT ALWAYS WELCOMING. A YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO INFUSE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR INTO AN INSTITUTION AND EXPECT THEM TO ACT LIKE MEN WERE WHITE. OF THEY BRING A DIFFERENT KIND OF FLAVOR AFFECTED THEM. ALL A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE TO THE CAMPUS AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT STUDENTS ARE TRACKED A TO DO. BOB AND SO IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU ARE COSTLY LOOKING FOR THOSE FACULTY OR YOUR COLLEAGUE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU WHO MAY NOT LOOK LIKE YOU WOULD ACT LIKE YOU. THEN YOU END UP. BASICALLY BRINGING PEOPLE INTO A INSTITUTION WHICH WE OFTEN DO THAT HAVE LITTLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE STUDENTS AT ALL. OKAY AND SO I I DIDN'T ADMIT IT'S NOT ONLY YOU IT'S ALSO K. TWELVE AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE REALIZE OF ONCE YOU. DECIDE THAT THE INSTITUTION. NEEDS TO BE INFUSED WITH THAT WITH A DIVERSE FACULTY ARE DIVERSE CURRICULUM WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IVORY TOWER WOULD NO LONGER BE IVORY COLORED ANYMORE. IT WILL BE YOU KNOW MAYBE JAMAICAN COLORED OR WHATEVER BUT IT WILL NOT BE THE SAME AND THAT AND AND I FOUND AS A FACULTY MEMBER. ON THE SENATE AND CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THAT WAS PROBABLY THE GREATEST CHALLENGE THAT PEOPLE WANTED FOLKS THERE BUT THEY WANTED THEM TO ACT LIKE THEM. AND I'D REMIND THAT THIS IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE HE DOESN'T ACT LIKE THE OTHER ONES AND HE'S IT AND THE STUDENTS ARE TRACKED IT TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SWAGGER TO HIM THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EXCITING. UP HIS CURRICULUM YOU KNOW HIS SUBJECT MATTERS IS CLEAR HE TEACHES A CLASS HE KNOWS MATERIAL WHAT HE MAY BE A LITTLE LOUDER IN THE HALLWAY THAN SOMEBODY ELSE OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. AND SO WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IT IS GOING TO CHANGE IT IS NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE. AND I THINK THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THE HARDEST PART A I'D YOU KNOW AND AND AND AND. AND AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN I WAS ON THE FACULTY. WE WOULD HAVE FOLKS WHO WOULD DIE GO OUT WITH EVERY INTENTION TO HIRE A PERSON. AND BRING THEM TO CAMPUS AFRICAN AMERICAN. BRING THEM TO CAMP WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE FACULTY INTRODUCED INTO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEN I WOULD LEAD. THEY WOULD GET HOME THEY WOULD CALL ME BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID DID YOU MEET GOT THE WEBER GOOD CHEER FOSCA SAID NO. AND SO THEY WOULD CALL ME AND SAY I DIDN'T MEET ANY BLACK PEOPLE WHAT I WAS ON CAMPUS. WHERE IS THAT BLACK LIFE THAT I'M GOING TO BE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY THAT I'M GOING TO BE A PART OF TO? AND SOMETIME AND AND I MENTION THAT TO COLLEAGUES ARE SO WHAT WE DON'T THINK THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. WHAT IS IMPORTANT YOU HIRING AFRICAN AMERICANS KNOW THAT THERE'S AN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO THERE'S ONE ON CAMPUS FACULTY AND STAFF? AND THAT THEY MAY WANT TO BE A PART OF IT BECAUSE AND THEN THEY REALIZE I COULD NOT ONLY TEACH HERE BUT I CAN LIVE HERE AS WELL. AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE RECOGNITION AND AND AND REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF OF INTERVIEW PANELS AND. WHO YOU TAKE FOLKS TO SEE AND WHEN YOU BRING AROUND THE CAMPUS THERE'S ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAVEN'T MAKE A TREMENDOUS CHANGE IN THE PERSON SAYING YES I WILL CALM? I HATE TO CUT THIS UNLESS THERE'S ENOUGH. THAT'S THE BAD NEWS THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION YEAH A COUPLE MONTHS RIGHT BACK YOU'RE YOU SEE OUR. AND. WILL LET ME GET AS A TO GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WERE WERE ONLY TWENTY THREE MINUTES BY SCHEDULE. OF WHICH HAS AS WAS BEING THE FOURTH HEARING OF GOTTEN USED TO BY NOW. BUT LET'S BRING UP OUR SECOND. PANEL OF OF FOLKS WE'RE GONNA SPEAK TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY AND LECTURERS FROM A UNION PERSPECTIVE.

AND I'M ALSO VICE PRESIDENT AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. FOR THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE GROSSMONT CUYAMACA COLLEGES. SO THANK YOU. TO THE COMMITTEE MARC BERMAN IS CHAIR JOSE MEDINA AND MY FELLOW SAN DIEGANS SHIRLEY WEBER FOR INVITING ME. IN FRAMING THE MASTER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION NINETEEN SIXTY CLERK HER TO FIND A FORMAL STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE THREE YEARS OF JUNIOR COLLEGES STATE COLLEGES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. CURRENT VISION BOTH SOCIAL INCLUSIVENESS INSTANCE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND THE CULTURAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH AND NOT WAS A MARRIAGE MERITOCRATIC SYSTEM. AT THAT MOMENT. IN MANY WAYS. THIS VISION SEEMED TOO FEW OPTIMISM THE STATE OPTIMISM WHICH. INFLUENCED. PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOR. SOMETIME. FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS APPARENT THAT CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS HAVE STRENGTHS IN OFFERING STUDENTS LIFE CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES AND ACADEMIC AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AND IN ADVANCING SCHOLARLY RESEARCH. YET THE GREAT PLAN WHICH CLARK HER. ARTICULATED HAS STALL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDED HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN SOME WAYS. BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. LIBERTARIAN INSURGENCY AND THE ANTI TAXATION MOVEMENTS SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIANS. THE DESTABILIZING RISE OF THE SUPER RICH ENTREPRENEURS CONCENTRATED IN THE SILICON VALLEY. AND THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH AMONG THE NEW ELITE NOW SOME OF THOSE NEWLY MONIED VENTURED PHILANTHROPISTS. CORD OPPORTUNITIES WITH POLITICIANS AND EDUCATIONAL LEADERS IN THE TOP RANKS OF THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS TO PROMOTE THEIR BRANDS. AND VARIOUS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL REFORM. BUFFETED BY THESE FORCES COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY FACULTY. FACE MARGINALISATION FACULTY CONTENDER IN THE PUSH TO BOOST ENROLLMENT INCREASE STUDENT RETENTION AND SUCCESS RATES LEADING TO DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES FOR TRANSFER AND EMPLOYMENT. THAT THEIR VOICES ARE NOT HEARD. AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF STUDENT NEEDS IS DISREGARDED WHOLESALE. TODAY I FOCUS ON WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE FACULTY IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I START BY POINTING OUT. THAT DESPITE SOME NEGATIVISM IN SOME CORNERS THE SUCCESSES. OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE VERY REAL IF YOU STATISTICS ILLUSTRATE MY POINT. IN ACADEMIC YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ROLLED THROUGH POINT ONE FIVE MILLION STUDENTS THAT WITH A LARGE THAT IS THE LARGEST SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. MAYBE IN THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO UC TRANSFERS. INCREASED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX INCREASED BY SIXTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE STUDENTS. SOME FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF CSU GRADUATES IN TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF YOU SEE GRADUATE STARTED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATES ENTERED THE LABOR FORCE IN IN EARNED WAGES WHICH ONLY AVERAGE WERE HIGHER THAN THOSE PAID TO EMPLOYEES. LACKING ANY COLLEGE DEGREES. EVERYDAY THE OAK COMMUNITY COLLEGES THANKS MICK AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY THINGS MANY HURDLES. IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY BY TEMPLE UNIVERSITY IN THE WISCONSIN HOPEFULLY AB. WHICH INCLUDED THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND SAMPLING INDICATES THAT FORTY TWO PERCENT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. CONTENT HOUSING INSECURITY FORTY TWO PERCENT. AND THAT FORTY SIX PERCENT SUFFER FROM FOOD INSECURITY. MEANWHILE CSU LEADERSHIP NOW RECOGNIZES THE URGENT NEED FOR ENHANCE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH STUDENTS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED. STATE LEGISLATURE REPORTEDLY IS CONSIDERING MANDATING AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE RACIAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS TO SEE US USED. THE NEEDS IN THE MUCH LARGER COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ALMOST CERTAINLY ARE EVEN GREATER. THE SYSTEM IS GROSSLY UNDERFUNDED TO MEET THE DEMAND. ACROSS THE U. S. WE STRUGGLE WITH ILLITERACY AND IN NUMERACY. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY SIX APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO INVESTIGATIVE REPORT THIRTY FIVE MILLION ADULT AMERICANS ONE SIXTH OF THE POPULATION CANNOT READ AT THIRD GRADE LEVEL. MOST ARE WHITE EUROPEAN AMERICANS. THE PORTIONS OF THESE AMERICANS LACKING LITERACY SKILL OUR GREATEST AMONG LATINOS FORTY ONE PERCENT. IN AFRICAN AMERICANS THIRTY TWO PERCENT. DURING MY THREE DECADES OF TEACHING IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF OUR INCOMING STUDENTS. HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATING DEVELOPMENTAL TRAINING IN READING WRITING AND NUMERACY. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT ALL OF THE STATISTICS DESCRIBE REAL PEOPLE. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO YES WE FACULTY FACE MAJOR HURDLES BUT WE LACK THE FULL SUPPORT NEEDED TO ADVANCE OUR STUDENTS EDUCATION. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE BEEN THE ONE AND THEN THE INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSES OVER TIME. INSTEAD OF A PREDICTABLE REVENUE STREAM THE COLLEGES WERE FORCED TO CHASE ENROLLMENT. DEMONSTRATE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. THAT WE ARE BEING PRODUCTIVE AND DESERVING OF OUR FULL PORTION. GIVEN IS THE CONTINUOUS EBBING AND FLOWING OF ENROLLMENT SPECIAL NOW IN THE NUMBERS GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IS. TREATMENT. ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT DRIVEN DECISIONS OFTEN LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT POLICIES. THE ADVERSELY AFFECT BOTH STUDENTS AND FACULTY TRYING TO SERVE THEM. GOVERNOR BROWN'S PROPOSAL FOR PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING ONLY ADDS INSULT TO INJURY. SINCE THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE GROWING RELIANCE OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ON CONTINGENT FACULTY TO TEACH STUDENTS WHILE PER POLLING TENURE LINES IS BEEN A DIRTY SECRET. IS DATA FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. STATEWIDE I INDICATE DURING FALL OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE HEAD COUNT OF OF THE ADJUNCT FACULTY EMPLOYED THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WAS FORTY TWO THOUSAND FOURTY FOUR. OR SIXTY NINE POINT THREE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGE HEAD COUNT OF SIXTY THOUSAND SIX THIRTY THREE. LIMITED TO ASSIGNMENTS OF SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF A FULL LOAD PER ACADEMIC YEAR IN ANYONE DISTRICT MANY OF THE AYE JACKSON URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS HAVE ASSIGNMENTS AT MULTIPLE DISTRICTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. EVEN WITH THOSE PAYCHECKS MOST ADJUNCT FACULTY STRUGGLING MEET THE COSTS OF LIVING. IT'S APPALLING. THE ADJUNCT FACULTIES. STILL ACCOUNT FOR FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT FACULTY. GENERALLY AS WELL. THE ADJUNCT FACULTY ARE ABLE TO TAKE ON THE LITTLE IF ANY SERVICE WORK WHICH MEANS PROGRAM REVIEW CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT. AND REVISION INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND THE NEVER ENDING ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTING. FOR THEIR DEPARTMENTS. CONSEQUENTLY THE TENURE LINE FACULTY ARE LEFT WITH MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS A TIME CONSUMING PROCESS IS A FACULTY EVALUATION AND SERVICE ON SHARED GOVERNANCE COMMITTEES. THAT KEEP THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE COLLEGE IS RUNNING. FOR LEASE THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE COLLEGES HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH. THE NEW INITIATIVES. IN A MID COURSE CORRECTIONS OF ONGOING. INITIATIVES ALWAYS TAUGHT DOWN. MOST EMANATE FROM THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL WHO ACTUALLY GATES THOSE REFORM AND AGENDAS. MOSTLY THEY'RE GRANT FROM THE GATES LUMINA KEY GOAL JAMES IRVINE COLLEGE FUTURES AND WILLIAM AND FLORA HEWLETT FOUNDATION. ALL ARE LAUNCHED FROM THE TOP RANKS WITH MINIMAL INPUT FROM FACULTY PROFESSIONS HAVING PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE. MOST OF THESE AGENDAS ARE ONE SIZE FITS ALL THEY FOCUS ON INSTRUCTIONAL METHODOLOGY IN OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT. TYPICALLY THE PLANS ARE STEEPED IN JARGON FROM SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION. CONCEPT THEY IGNORE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES WHILE BEING ORIENTED TOWARDS CAREER TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS BUT ALL PROGRAMS. ALIKE OUR TASK TO GET ON BOARD WITH THE LATEST REGIMES. WHETHER THESE MEASUREMENTS WHAT WHETHER ALL THESE MEASURE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES OR DEVELOPING GUIDED PATHWAYS. SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES ARE EVEN INHERENTLY CONTRADICTORY. THAT'S FACULTY APPLAUDED TRANSFORM CLASSES AND ONLINE FORMAT SO THE COLLEGES WILL PARTICIPATE NEW ONLINE EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVE. OR EVEN GOVERNOR BROWN'S. OPPOSE A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN. COMMUNITY COLLEGE A FULLY ONLINE INSTITUTION. THE SAME TIME THOMAS BAILEY WHO IS ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONS FOR GUIDED PATHWAYS. THOMAS BAILEY AS ASSOCIATES. HAVE ARGUED. DEFINITIVELY THAT ONLINE COURSES ARE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE IN IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR. AND THAT'S BACKED UP BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE REPORT OF CALIFORNIA TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ON THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE REPORT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY. AND THOSE ARE NATIONAL. STE STUDIES INVOLVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. SO WHAT AM I ASKING THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE. ON THE MASTER PLAN. WELL TO REPORT FIRST OFF TO REPLACE THE INEFFICIENT ENROLLMENT BASE FUNDING MODEL WITH A SIMPLE FORMULA ALLOCATING A PROPORTION OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET RESOURCES TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO MEET THE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS WOULD PARALLEL THE BUDGETING PROCESS FOR BASIC A DISTRICTS. TOOK. FUN THE TRANSFORMATION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY INVEST IN THE HIRING OF TENURE LINE FACULTY TO MEET THAT SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE RATIO. THAT WAS FIRST PUT FORWARD IN AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE DATING BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR GOD SAKES IS LONG OVERDUE. NUMBER THREE IN THE SHORT RUN. BOOSTS FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO ENHANCE ADJUNCT FACULTY SALARY SCHEDULES AND TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF COMPENSATION FOR ADJUNCT FACULTY HOLDING EVEN LIMITED OFFICE HOURS. FOR BILL ONE RECENT PROGRESS TO IMPROVE THE COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIO. FIVE. ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR STUDENT SERVICES TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY IN THE STUDENT POPULATION NOT JUST PATCHWORK BUT SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL. SIX PROVIDE INCENTIVES WERE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TO PARTNER WITH PUBLIC AGENCIES IN IDENTIFYING PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR STUDENTS HOUSING INSECURITY. SEVEN AND FINALLY STOP THE PRIVATIZATION OF THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE IMPACT OF GRANT FUNDING IT'S UNDERMINING SHARED GOVERNANCE AND REDIRECTING THIS TECHNICIAN THE COLLEGES WITH LITTLE SUBSTANTIVE AND I EMPHASIZE SUBSTANTIVE. IMPORT FROM ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS FACULTY CLASSIFIED PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND STUDENTS IN YES EVEN HONEST ADMINISTRATORS. IF I CAN SPEAK OFF THE RECORD. ARE REFORM INITIATIVE WHERE. WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODEL IN GROUP GET BACK TO OUR CORE MISSION. CLOSING I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING MY TESTIMONY IN CONSIDERING MY RECOMMENDATIONS. THE U. DOUG MACLEOD. DOCTOR LEE'S. I'M SHARON A LEASE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT SOUTH COUNSEL FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. THIS THE FAA REPRESENTS MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TENURE LINE PROFESSORS LECTURERS LIBRARIANS COUNSELORS AND COACHES ON THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. ALSO KNOWN AS THE PEOPLE'S UNIVERSITY. I AM ALSO PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF THE SOCIOLOGY DEPARTMENT. AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. YOU ASKED US OF A CERTAIN A SET OF QUESTIONS AND I WANT TO RESPOND IN THAT WAY SO FIRST AS WE CONSIDER WHAT FACULTY NEED TO TO SUPPORT STUDENTS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ACCESS AND EQUITY. IN THE CFA WE LIKE TO SAY THAT FACULTY TEACHING CONDITIONS ARE STUDENT LEARNING CONDITIONS THIS IS WHY WE FOCUS ON WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS. IN TERMS OF ACCESS WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE ARISEN TO MEET CSU QUALIFICATIONS SO THEY DESERVE ACCESS. AND YET AT THE END OF SCHWARZENEGGER'S GOVERNORSHIP AND THROUGHOUT GOVERNOR BROWN'S RECENT TENURE BOTH THE CSU IN THE UC TURNED AWAY TENS OF THOUSANDS WHO WERE QUALIFIED. EVERY YEAR. THIS IS A CRISIS FOR CALIFORNIA'S A LONG TERM ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL BEING THESE PROTECTIVE STUDENTS WILL EITHER GO TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS OR THEY WON'T GO. THE STATE'S PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING AMOUNTS TO AN UNDER FUNDING WITH AN ALLOCATION OF JUST NINETY TWO MILLION. ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THIS YEAR'S YOU ADMINISTRATION COUNTERS WITH THE REQUEST OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION STILL NOT ENOUGH. CFA RECOMMENDS FUNDING THE CSU AT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION. ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ONLY THIS FUNDING LEVEL WOULD HELP TO INCREASE STUDENT ADMISSIONS UP TO A POINT OF AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FTE STUDENTS STILL NOT THE NUMBER. THAT IS BEING TURNED AWAY ONLY HALF. ARE RECENT REPORT AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE CAL FACT DOT ORG EQUITY INTERRUPTED SHOWED THAT THE CSU SYSTEM EDUCATES MORE DIVERSE STUDENT BODY TODAY THAN IT DID THIRTY YEARS AGO. BUT ASTHMA NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF COLOR INCREASED THE FUNDING WENT DOWN AS WE SEE IT WHEN THE STUDENT BODY GOT DARKER THE FUNDING GOT LIGHTER. ONLY IT'S NOT FUNNY. NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF THE STUDENT BODY IN THE CSU IS FROM CALIFORNIA THREE QUARTERS OF THEM IDENTIFY AS STUDENTS OF COLOR. WE KNOW HIGHER EDUCATION IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE AND THAT IT'S HELPFUL FOR THE ECONOMY AS WELL SO WE URGE THAT THE CSU BE FUNDED AT A LEVEL THAT INSURERS. ALL QUALIFIED CSU GRADUATES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERS ARE ADMITTED TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. OUR REQUEST FOR THAT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION WOULD ONLY RETURN US TO HALF THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT ENJOYED BY STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN THE AVERAGE STUDENT WAS A WHITE MALE. IN TERMS OF EQUITY A RELATED ASPECT IS THE STUDENTS NEED FACULTY WHO CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH EQUITY IN EDUCATION WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN FACULTY HIRING AND EVALUATION. THAT OBSTRUCT THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FACULTY. A SHORT HURT TERM I'M FOR THAT WOULD BE RACISM RACISM IS A PROBLEM HAVEN'T HEARD THAT WORD TODAY SO I FEEL LIKE PUTTING THAT OUT ON THE TABLE. STUDENTS NEED AND DESERVE A FACULTY THAT MIRRORS THE COMPOSITION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE OVERALL CSU STUDENT POPULATION WE KNOW FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH THAT UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. ALSO NEED A CULTURALLY RELEVANT CURRICULA AND PEDAGOGY TO THRIVE SO WE MUST TRANSFORM TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF THE CORNERSTONES OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO NOT JUST INCLUDE BUT EVEN CENTER COURSES IN ETHNIC STUDIES. AND WOMEN'S STUDIES ALONG WITH PEDAGOGIES BASED IN COLLABORATIVE LEARNING SERVICE LEARNING AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT ARTICULATE WHAT THE COMMUNITY ETHOS FROM WHICH MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DRAW THEIR STRENGTH. THE SECOND QUESTION YOU ASKED US TO ADDRESS OUR THE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS FACULTY FACING MEETING STUDENT NEEDS. WE FILL CENTRAL TO THIS QUESTION IS DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY. THAT QUALITY HIGHER EDUCATION CAN ONLY BE ASSURED BY ENDING THE RECENT TRENDS TOWARD RELIANCE ON QUOTE UNQUOTE TEMPORARY FACULTY AND THEY SAY THAN QUOTES RECENTLY OF FACULTY IN MY DEPARTMENT RETIRED. FROM HER TEMPORARY JOB AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT. LECTURER FACULTY POSITIONS. A NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS SIMPLY POSITION SPACE AND INSTRUCTION WHEREAS TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITIONS INCLUDE SCHOLARLY AND CREATIVE ACTIVITY AND SERVICE AS OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED HERE. ADVISING MENTORING COLLABORATIVE WORK WITH STUDENTS COMMITTEE SERVICE ACADEMIC PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW FACULTY PEER EVALUATION AND SO FORTH. FIFTY YEARS OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENT AT VANCE MEN IN AND BEYOND COLLEGE DEPENDS ON RELATIONSHIPS THEY BUILD WITH FACULTY THROUGH THE KINDS OF SERVICE THAT TENURE TRACK FACULTY PROVIDE. FOR GROWING NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE OF COLOR WHO ARE IMMIGRANT WHO ARE FIRST GENERATION WHO ARE VETERAN THESE MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS ARE CRITICAL TO THEIR SUCCESS. EXAMPLE I HAD A STUDENT WHO WISHES WALK INTO THE CAFETERIA WHEN I SAW HER SHE WAS ON THE VERGE OF DROPPING OUT I HAD NO IDEA. BUT WHEN WE SPOKE SHE STAYED IN SCHOOL SHE GOT STRATEGIES TO STAY AND SHE IS A NATIVE WOMAN AN INDIGENOUS WOMAN WHO IS NOW A FULL PROFESSOR. AT A COLLEGE. WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SO THROUGH TENURE TRACK FACULTY. WE CAN PROVIDE THESE KINDS OF SERVICES IMPORTANT TO OUR STUDENTS BUT THE GROWING RELIANCE ON THE CONTINGENT FACULTY WORKFORCE MEANS THAT WE ARE UNDER SERVING THOSE STUDENTS. AND IT ALSO MEANS A GREATER BURDEN ON THOSE WHO OUR FACULTY OF COLOR IN THE CFA WE CALL THIS CULTURAL TAXATION THAT FACULTY OF COLOR HAVE TO PAY AS THEY ARE THE ONES WHO KNOW WHAT THEIR STUDENTS NEED. AND I SEE THIS THROUGH EFFORTS OF MY COLLEAGUES SO FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WILL SAY PROFESSOR X. KEPT ME IN SCHOOL OR I DIDN'T FEEL I BELONGED HERE BUT PROFESSOR X. TOLD ME ABOUT HER JOURNEY TO THE PHD. AND SHE HAD THE SAME STRUGGLES IT GAVE ME CONFIDENCE SO PROFESSOR ACCESS CULTURALLY TAX BUT SHE WILL PAY THAT TAX TO HELP THOSE STUDENTS STAY IN SCHOOL. CFA THEREFORE PROPOSES A BUDGET THAT SETS ASIDE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF EXISTING ONGOING FUNDS JUST TO TARGET THE HIRING OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY. THE THIRD FRAMING QUESTION WAS HOW THE MASTER PLAN OF MET THE NEEDS OF FACULTY AND WHAT IS AN ACTION THE STATE COULD TAKE THAT WOULD REQUIRE FUNDING WHAT IS ONE THAT WOULD. SHARED GOVERNANCE COST NOTHING TO THE CSU IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CSU TO RESPECT THE WAYS THAT FACULTY CONSULTATION CAN INFORM THE DIRECTION AND SHAPE OF EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. YET IN RECENT DECADES AND PARTICULARLY ALL THROUGH THIS YEAR WE SAW CASE AFTER CASE OF POLICIES THAT OUT WITHOUT CONSULTATION WITH FACULTY. THIS EXPERIENCE WITH ADMINISTRATIVE FIATS FOR EXAMPLE WITH CHANGES IN GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS IS A CASE IN POINT. IN TERMS OF ONE THING THE LEGISLATION COULD DO TO SUPPORT NEEDS A FACULTY THAT DOES HAVE A COST WE NEED A LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE TO SUPPORT. FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION SUCH AS THE LEGISLATION RECENTLY INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. MY FATHER'S PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS FROM THE CARIBBEAN WHO ENJOYED FREE EDUCATION IN THE UC SYSTEM. MY MOTHER WHO IS HERE WITH ME AND HER FAMILY ENJOYED FREE EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN LA. MY HUSBAND AND ONE OF MY CHILDREN ARE CSU GRADUATES WHO LIKE ME AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN MY GENERATION INCLUDING MANY OF OUR LEGISLATURES. LATERS BENEFITED FROM AN ALMOST FREE HIGHER EDUCATION SO WHY AREN'T STUDENTS GETTING THE SAME DEAL WE GOT BY THE TIME MY DAUGHTER GRADUATED FROM THE C. S. YOU A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. HER TUITION WAS FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT HIGHER THAN HER FATHER PAID. THERE IS A STRONG ECONOMIC CASE FOR FREE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA WILL BE OVER ONE MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATE SHORT. DEBATE THAT MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE ECONOMY BY TWENTY THIRTY JUST AROUND THE CORNER. THIS TREND WILL WORSEN WITHOUT ACTION. EDUCATION IS ARE DRIVING FORCE FOR OUR ECONOMY. AND IT'S ALSO SUCH AN IMPORTANT GIFT THAT WE CAN GIVE OURSELVES AND OUR CITIZENS LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING FOR STUDENTS IN THE PEOPLE'S UNIVERSITY. ASSURE THEIR ACCESS TO AN EDUCATION BASED ON EQUITY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY WHO CAN DEVOTE TIME TO MENTORING THEM IN AN INSTITUTION THAT THRIVES BECAUSE IT IS REASONABLY FUNDED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS HONOR. THANK YOU DOCTOR LEADS AND DOCUMENT GOT MCIVER. CHAIR BERMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA DOCTOR WEBER COLLEAGUES IN THE AUDIENCE AND THOSE WATCHING ONLINE TODAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU. I RECEIVED MY PHD FROM UC IRVINE MEANING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA INVESTED IN ME AS A SCHOLAR AND A TEACHER. SO I AM PART OF THE PIPELINE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. IT'S AN HONOR TO REPAY THAT TRUSTS AND HELP GUIDE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE. I'M CURRENTLY A CONTINGENT FACULTY MEMBER AT UCLA AND PRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY COUNCIL AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. THE LABOR UNION REPRESENTING YOU SEE LECTURES AND LIBRARIANS. I SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF NON TENURE TRACK FACULTY WHO ARE INTEGRAL TO THE UC'S TRIPARTITE MISSION. OF RESEARCH EDUCATION AND SERVICE. THE NINETEEN SIXTY MASTER PLAN NEVER ENVISIONED THE WIDESPREAD EXPLOITATION OF UNDERPAID UNDEREMPLOYED FACULTY. YET THAT IS THE SITUATION AT THE UC TODAY AND AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE CS USE. UC'S UP FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED LECTURERS TEACH ONE THIRD OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT CREDIT HOURS. ALL OF THOSE ARE OFTEN GATE CLASS THAT OFF ENTRY INTO THE. I'M FOR ME WHEN MY TEACHER OF FIRST YEAR STUDENTS. I LOOK FORWARD EVERY FALL TO THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS TO BEING IN THE CLASSROOM WITH MY STUDENTS AND SAYING TO THEM MANY OF THEM FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. WELCOME TO COLLEGE THAT IS A MAGIC MOMENT. ALTOGETHER PRECARIOUS INSTRUCTORS INCLUDING ADJUNCTS VISITING ASSISTANT PROFESSORS ACADEMIC STUDENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS TEACH NEARLY ONE HALF OF UNDERGRADUATE CREDIT HOURS. FACULTY GROWTH IS OCCURRING MAINLY CONTINGENT TITLES. THE UC USES TEMPORARY FACULTY TO DO PERMANENT WORK A SHORT SIGHTED POLICY SHORT INJURED POWERFUL ASTUTE. I MIGHT BOTH CAN WORK AS A BRIEF I TO YOU UBER FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE FIFTY FOUR PERCENT MORE STUDENTS AT THE UC TODAY THAN IN TWO THOUSAND CLEARLY INDICATING A LONG TERM NEED FOR HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION. EXCELLENT LECTURERS ARE TREATED AS DISPOSABLE AND SUBJECT TO FORCED TO TURN OVER. OFTEN PREVENTED FROM TEACHING LONGER THAN A YEAR OR TWO. LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I WORK MULTIPLE JOBS AGAINST ME AND STRUGGLE TO REMAIN IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. ARE. DOT. PERCENTAGES NECESSARILY A LOOP SURE. FROM BASIC HELP RETIRED BENEFIT. AND WE PERFORMED COUNTLESS HOURS OF UNCOMPENSATED RESEARCH AND SERVICE NOT TO MENTION THE EMOTIONAL SERVICE AND LABOR I THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALSO DESCRIBED. OUR WORKING CONDITIONS IN HER PROFOUND FEELINGS OF ISOLATION ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. BY NEGLECTING A CORE OF INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED TALENTED EXPERIENCED AND ACCOMPLISH FACULTY THE UC DIMINISHES THE SEDIKIT A PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO ARE SO WELL PREPARED TO MENTOR STUDENTS. AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY KILLS ME IT IS SUCH A WASTE. YOU SEE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ADMINISTRATORS PUBLICLY DESCRIBED CONTINUED FACULTY AS SUBSIDIZING TENURE TRACK FACULTY BY TEACHING THEIR CLASSES FOR THEM. THIS TWO TIER MODEL IN WHICH TEACHING IS EFFECTIVELY OUTSOURCED DRIVES A WEDGE BETWEEN FACULTY AND CREATES CLEAR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHERE WE SHOULD BE UNITED. THIS IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF EQUITY WITHIN A FACULTY HIERARCHY BUT ALSO OF RACIAL AND GENDER EQUITY. LECTURER MORE LIKELY THAN TRACK PUTTING THE WOMEN AND OF COLOR. YOU SEE CAMPUSES INTENSIFY THE STRATIFICATION. BY SEPARATING RESEARCH AND TEACHING INTO DISTINCT. WHEREAS THE MASTER PLAN OF ORIGINALLY EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE CALLER TEACHER. I SEE ADMINISTRATORS ARE INCREASINGLY SAID TARGET PENTAGON FROM. A CLEAR DISSERVICE TO BOTH THE STUDENTS BENEFIT STARTING WITH EXPERTS IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS. AND A FACULTY HIS RESEARCH BENEFITS FROM ENGAGING STUDENT PRESS. AND CONSIDERING THE FUTURE OF THE MASTER PLAN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. STORE STATE FUNDING HISTORICALLY HIGH LOW AND DEDICATE A STABLE FUND SOURCE TO ALL THREE SEGMENTS OF. HIGHER EDUCATION. THREE HELLO WE HIGHER EDUCATION COALITION HAS PERHAPS ONE SUCH PILE. THE SIXTY SIX DOLLAR FIX. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS DESERVED TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DEBT FREE. STABLE AND DEDICATED FUNDING WILL ALSO RELIEVE THE YOU SEE FROM THE BUDGETARY UNCERTAINTY THAT DRIVES FACULTY PER CHARITES AND UNDERMINE STUDENT SUCCESS. REFORM THE BOARD OF REGENTS TO ENSURE ITS MEMBERS BETTER REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS AND YOU SEE STAKEHOLDERS. PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL INSTEAD OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INCLUDE A SEAT FOR CONTINGENT FACULTY MEMBER. INCLUDE MEASURES OF CONTENTION FACULTY WELFARE IN ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS FOR THE UC AND SET AMBITIOUS TARGETS FOR THE UC TO MEET. THE MOST REVEALING STATISTICS TO ANALYZE WOULD BE LECTURER TURNOVER RATE AN AVERAGE APPOINTMENT PERCENTAGE AND I HAVE SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS WITH ME TODAY IN CASE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED DURING THE CUBAN. AND FINALLY ADVOCATE FOR CONTINGENT FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND INCLUSION IN ACADEMIC INITIATIVES. WELL TAKING CARE NOT TO INFRINGE ON. THE FAMOUS ECONOMY THE USE DE. THROUGHOUT THE CHURCH THERE'S THE SENSE TO. STOP TURNOVER BY INSTITUTING READ BRING RIGHTS FOR EARLY CAREER CONTINGENT FACULTY. I PICKING ONE OF MY CLASSES MY STUDENTS OFTEN ASK WHETHER THEY CAN TAKE ANOTHER WITH ME. I HAVE TO RESPOND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'LL BE TEACHING NEXT YEAR. WE CAN ONLY INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UNIVERSITY INVESTS IN OFFICE. IMPROVE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION BY REPLACING STUDENT EVALUATIONS OF TEACHING WITH A VOICE IN THEIR OWN EDUCATE. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. BUT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT USING STUDENT EVALUATIONS AND PERSONNEL DECISIONS PERPETUATES RACISM AND SEXISM COMPROMISES ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND GENERATES A CUSTOMER SERVICE DYNAMIC THAT UNDERMINE SOUND PEDAGOGY. ESTABLISH PAY PARITY AMONG TENURE TRACK AND NON TENURE TRACK FACULTY. ENOUGH SAID. IN FRANCHISE LECTURES AN ADJUNCT THROUGH MEMBERSHIP IN THE UC ACADEMIC SENATE. WE TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATING STUDENTS BUT LITTLE TOO NO VOICE IN DECISION MAKING ABOUT CURRICULA AND OTHER MATTERS. THERE'S NO JUSTIFIABLE REASON TO EXCLUDE SUCH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF FACULTY FROM SHARED GOVERNANCE. MY STUDENTS MAKE ME FIERCELY PROUD WHEN THEY GRADUATE WITH THE ABILITY TO INQUIRE TO CHALLENGE AND TO CREATE. THE YOU SEE MAKES ME FIERCELY PROUD WHEN IT EMPOWERS MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WITHIN AND BEYOND THE UNIVERSITY. BY INVITING CONTENDER FACULTY TO THIS HEARING YOU'VE ALREADY SIGNAL THAT YOU SHARE THIS PRIDE. AS WELL AS A HOLISTIC VISION FOR RESEARCH TEACHING AND SERVICE AT THE UC. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAK TODAY FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND REFRAMING THE MASTER PLAN FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. YOU'RE MUCH LIKE MCIVER. THAT ALTMAN. CALLING THREE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT MIGHT HAVE. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AYE I AM. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT. CLEARLY GET TO THE HEART I THINK OF OF FACULTY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FACULTY IN ITS RELATIONSHIP TO. ACCOMPLISHING THE GOALS OF WE WANT. YEAH I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY FOLLOW THE. SOME KIND OF THE OF THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WE PUT FORWARD TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS AND AND. YOU KNOW BEING THE BILL THE ONE MEMBER I THINK IN THE HOUSE OF THE ONE OF TWO THAT HAVE ACTUALLY SERVED IN. AS A TENURED FACULTY ON ONE OF THESE CAMPUSES AND CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT AND. ALSO KINDA KNOW THE DRAMA AND THE TRAUMA INVOLVED IN PART TIME HIRING AND THE RATIO. THAT EXISTS BETWEEN FACULTY FULL TIME TENURE TRACK FACULTY AND A PART TIME FACULTY. IT IS CRITICAL FOR AN INSTITUTION TO HAVE A LOT OF TENURED FACULTY. BECAUSE THAT REALLY GETS TO US OF THE MISSION WE WANT WHICH IS. THAT ONLY GIVING STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. A MENTOR AND A SUPPORTER. BUT DODD TO STABILIZE THE INSTITUTION AND OFFERINGS OF THE YEAR AND TO ACTUALLY RUN THE INSTITUTIONS YOU KNOW IF FACULTY ARE SUPPOSED TO RUN THE UNIVERSITIES WHICH THEY TELL US. WHEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH OF US. AS IT ALSO STILL HAVE THIS BAND A DIVINITY BUT ANYWAY WE NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM I PUT TO BE ABLE TO SERVE ON ALL THESE COMMITTEES OTHERWISE YOU BURN OUT. AND. AND SO YOU DON'T GET THE QUALITY THAT YOU WANT THAT'S THE AS WELL AS FACULTY. A PART TIME FACULTY THAT RUNS AROUND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO ALSO LOOK AT IS THAT I FOUND DISTURBING. I WHEN I WAS IN AND MOST IF IT'S STILL THERE I'M SURE HE IS AYE MANOMETER LONG. IS THAT WHEN WE GET READY TO HIRE PERMIT FACULTY WE GENTLY DON'T LOOK TO OUR PART TIMES TO HIRE. AT THE C. ISSUE. OF THAT AND AND AND IT'S IT WAS ALWAYS ALARMING TO ME THAT. I'D HAVE I'D MEET INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR TEN TWENTY YEARS WORKING AND SOMETIMES TEACHING FIVE AND SIX CLASSES WITH THE AVERAGE FACULTY TEACHES ABOUT TWO TO THREE. AND WHAT IT CAME DOWN TO HIRE A PERMANENT PERSON PERMIT FACULTY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER. THIS PART TIME WHO HAD A STRONG RECORD OF TEACHING. WHO MAY NOT HAVE A STRONG RECORD OF A PUBLICATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE TEACHING SO MANY CLASSES RUNNING ALL OF THE WORLD? IT WAS RARE I MEAN ABSOLUTELY IT'S RARE WHEN A PART TIME FACULTY GOT A FULL TIME POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY AFTER TEACHING FOR FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS. AND I FOUND THAT TO BE ALARMING I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CHANGED ANY. BUT. YOU KNOW HERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S TRIED AND TRUE THAT YOU KNOW CAN DO THE JOB AND YET THEY DON'T GET DOING DON'T GET THE NOT THEY DON'T GET THE. PERMIT FACULTY POSITION SO BEING IDENTIFIED AS AN ADJUNCT WITHOUT FACULTY IS REALLY A LIFE SENTENCE. YOU WANT TO BE THAT ADJUNCT FACULTY IF YOU IF YOU REMAIN IN THE SYSTEM. WHATEVER. AND I'VE SEEN I HAVE FRIENDS WHO'VE BEEN ADJUNCTS FOR. A YEARS I'VE ONLY HAD ONE WHO ACTUALLY BECAME AND MESA OF OF LOSE CHAIR OF A BLACK STUDIES NOW OF WHO'S A FORMER STUDENT MY. MOVE ACTION BECAME A PERMANENT FACULTY. EVERYBODY ELSE ESTADO. NOT STARLETS THE CHEMO MY JASA. IT'S A FULL TIME FACULTY I BELIEVE YEAH BUT WITH. THE CHEMO CAME IN AS A PART TIME FACULTY AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE I'VE KNOWN TO ACTUALLY BE HIRED AS A FULL TIME PERSON UP FACULTY AFTERWARD. ISN'T THAT THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW WHAT I NOT SEE IS YOU. THAT IS RARE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY IT SEE ISSUE MAYBE ONE. THAT ACTUALLY AFTER MY FORTY YEARS WHO ACTUALLY GOT A FULL TIME POSITION AND HAVE BEEN A PART HAD BEEN A AN ADJUNCT FACULTY MEMBER. AND A AND THAT WAS ALWAYS ALARMING TO ME BECAUSE WHEN WE OPEN THE POOL WE WOULD NEVER THEY'VE IF THEY APPLIED THERE WOULD NEVER CONSIDER. THERE WILL ALWAYS THE NEW LISTS FLAVOR THAT SEEM MORE EXCITING YOU KNOW THAT WAS THERE BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AS WE TRIED AND. COULD BILLS FOR I HAVE THE TO GET TO THE SEVENTY FIVE INCLUDES THE SEVENTY FIVE IN SOME ANOTHER. IT'S HARD TO GET OUR MINISTRY DOES. AT THE END WHO IS IN CHARGE OF ALL THE SYSTEMS TO BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT'S IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THEY WANT. HOLD THE FLEXIBILITY TO. DO OTHER THINGS WITH THE RESOURCES AND OF SORTS IT BUT IT IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO CONTINUE THE CHAMPION. IT MAY BE SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BRING UP WITH THE NEW FOLKS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PIECE THANK YOU SO MUCH. I. AS DOCTOR WEBER BRINGS UP THE FACT OF THE OF BRINGING IT UP WITH THE NEW PERSON RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. THURSDAY EDITORIAL IN TODAY'S SACRAMENTO BEE. THAT SAYS JUST THAT ARE THAT THE NEXT GOVERNOR SHOULD BE SOMEONE WHO FULLY FUNDS. HIGHER EDUCATION THAT FULLY FUNDS I USUALLY. AND CSU. I SHARED THE ARTICLE OF THIS MORNING I SHARED THAT EDITORIAL THIS MORNING ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE AND I ASK THE QUESTION. WHY SHOULD WE WAIT ANOTHER YEAR? AND I SAY THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS. I SAY THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS. WEEKLY SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. ANOTHER YEAR. YOU NO EVERYONE ON THIS PANEL. HERE SO FAR AND I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO HEAR THE SAME THING I WRITE IN MY NOTES. THE IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING. I I DON'T THINK THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA CAN WAIT ANOTHER YEAR AND WE'RE HEARING THAT. I THINK VERY DRAMATICALLY A THROUGHOUT THE YEARS STUDENTS CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER YEAR SO. YOU NO LET'S NOT LET'S NOT WAIT ANOTHER YEAR WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT THIS YEAR WE NEED TO DO IT THIS YEAR. ONLINE I COLLEGE. WELL HOPEFULLY IS NOT GONNA GO IN THERE. YEAH I ALSO SERVED I ALSO SERVE ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND. YESTERDAY I MET WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY A IN SACRAMENTO. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MUCH BY EN. AMONG THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE ONLINE AND I AND I WILL MAKE AND THAT'S ANOTHER POINT THAT I HEARD. FROM PROFESSOR MCCLOUD THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN CONSULTATION THERE HASN'T BEEN CONSULTATION. EVEN. EVEN WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S WE HEARD. FROM BUT CHANCE THROUGH UP CAMINO. COLLEGE THAT IT WOULD BE THE WORST WELL THAT THAT WAS IN FUNDING AND IN REFERENCE TO THE FUNDING. REFORM AND BASS YEAH WELCOME YEAH BOTH PROPOSALS I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN CONSULTATION OF WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S. I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY CONSULTATION WITH A WITH THE FACULTY. SO I I I I MIGHT AGREE THAT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE BETTER SPENT. A IF IF WE WENT TO OF FULLY FUNDING. CHANGING THE RATIO I WAS A PART TIME. INSTRUCTOR. YEAH RCC AND. COLLEGE OF THE DESERT AND VALLEY COLLEGE AND I KNOW PERSONALLY AND SO THEREFORE I'M HAPPY TO TO PUT THE BILL'S FORWARD WITH DUH. WITH THE DOCTOR WEBER YOU KNOW TO GIVE OFFICE HOURS TO MAKE SURE THAT SENIORITY HIRING THAT SENIORITY IS USE. AND HIRING A PART TIME FACULTY. RIGHT NOW MY. STAFF PERSON LEFT TO GO TO RCC TO TALK WITH PART TIME FACULTY THAT'S WHERE SHE LEFT. IT'S WHERE SHE IS RIGHT NOW. WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IF IT WERE NOT FOR PART TIME FACULTY. AND AND AT THE SAME TIME FOR ALL THOSE DIFFERENT REASONS YOU KNOW THEY DON'T FEEL. LIKE FACULTY. THEY DON'T HAVE OFFICE HOURS THEY MAY NOT HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS. THEY CAN'T SERVE ON COMMITTEES. EVEN THINGS LIKE NOT BEING INCLUDED IN GRADUATION EXERCISES. AND. SO IF WE ARE. NEED TO DO MORE AND WE ARE HEARING THE NEEDS FOR DOING MORE. THERE'S LOTS. A LOTS OF STUFF HERE AND AND I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE HEARING SOME THINGS HERE THAT WE DON'T HEAR IN SACRAMENTO. AND THAT IS THAT THEIR FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING HERE UP ON THE GROUND. ON CAMPUS HEARING FROM YOU DIRECT. AGREED EL I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR ALL YOUR SUGGESTIONS MANY OF WHICH THIS IS THEY MORE FUNDING WHICH WHICH I THINK WERE ALL LINED ON THE NEED FOR SOME OF WHICH I DON'T. WHICH IS ALSO VERY HELPFUL. TO TO HAVE. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. SOME THEM ALL DO JUST QUICKLY ALIGN MY THOUGHTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS. AND WANT TO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY WE PLEASE. GO ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AND. OUR NEXT PANEL IS GOING TO BE OF THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS SERVICES STAFF. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME DOCTOR CHECK DOCTOR JAMES TODD VICE PRESIDENT OF STUDENT SERVICES MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE JUST AND JOSE. AG WE LARGE DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL AID THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE UNFORTUNATELY DOCTOR BRIDGET DRISKELL. FROM CSU DOMINGUEZ HILLS WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY. BUT I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE A GREAT PANEL. A WITHOUT TO MET ERRED ARCHDUCHY PANELISTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS YOUR. GOOD. OKAY. OKAY WE'RE GOOD GOOD THAT. BUT THAT'S. SO WHEN WE KICK IT OFF. WITH DOCTOR GOD WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. IF WE GIVE FOLKS IF THEY HAVE ANY CONVERSATIONS TO MAYBE TAKE THOSE UP SINGERS THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE WITH THE HEARING. THIS SONG ONLY HALF AN HOUR LATE. WELL THINK THINK YOU FOR FOR HAVING ME. I HAVE WONDERFUL DISCUSSION SO FAR I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES OUR. COMMITMENT THAT'S BEEN APPEAR ON EVERY PANEL SO FAR TO EQUITY AND DIVERSITY ACROSS OUR INSTITUTIONS AND I THINK YOU MORE. COMPREHENSIVELY ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS. MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE ALSO. CUTTING DRIVEN OUT OF THE. CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE LOCALLY AS ESPECIALLY CHIEF STUDENT SERVICES OFFICERS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM. ON WHAT ARE OUR FRUSTRATIONS I'M FROM STAFF IN HELPING STUDENTS SUCCEED. I WOULD THE HIGHEST IT YOU KNOW WOULD THE LARGEST. IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF A HIGH AS A AS SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE SERVE THE TOP HUNDRED PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT US JUST EXPRESSED TO THINK ABOUT THAT MEANS WE ARE SERVING STUDENTS THAT ARE INSIDE. KATIE TWELVE SYSTEM THROUGH OUR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT. WE ARE WORKING ON FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND SYSTEM AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS WE ARE WORK WITH. FOLKS THAT ARE HOMELESS THERE OFTEN. IN VERY DIRE. CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF THEIR SOCIAL LIFE SO. THE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS HOW DO WE BEST MOVE FROM A SYSTEM BROADLY BASED ON ACCESS AND ENROLLMENT. TOWARDS A SUCCESS DRIVEN MODEL. AND ONE THAT'S FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING EQUITY. AND I THINK AS WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE THE THE SYSTEMS HERE ARE HOW DO WE HAVE A MORE GLOBAL INTERSECT MENTAL APPROACH ACROSS STUDENT SUPPORT SYSTEMS. BECAUSE IT'S NEEDED IN TERMS OF BUILDING A MORE STRUCTURED AND INTENTIONAL PIPELINES FOR STUDENTS THERE IS FRUSTRATION ON HOW DO WE MOVE OUR STUDENTS FROM OUR SYSTEM AS A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. INTO THE UC'S END TO THE CS USE AND ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF CAPACITY. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BUILDING CAPACITY ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ON LOCAL CAMPUSES NOT NOT JUST TO KNOW WHY WE NEED TO CHANGE BUT HOW TO EXTRACT CHANGE AT SCALE ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF INTEGRATED STUDENT SUPPORT SO I HAVE FOUR MAIN POINTS I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON TODAY. ON THE FIRST ONE IS ABOUT OUR OWN TRANSFORMATIONAL DEMANDS AHEAD OF US AS THE CALIFORNIA RECALL SYSTEM. I'M WHICH MEANS THAT WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE TOOLS SUPPORT AND TRAINING FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE. I'M IN THIS ERA OF GUIDED PATHWAYS WHICH I THINK IS. MOVING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF ALIGNMENT. AND TRANSFORMATIONAL WORK ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AS WE RETHINK ABOUT HOW STUDENTS MOVE THROUGH OUR COLLEGES THERE'S GREAT NEED FOR RETRAINING STRUCTURE ORGANIZATIONS. AND IN PARTICULAR THE CHALLENGES INVOLVED RETRAINING AND RECLASSIFYING MANY CLASSIFY PROFESSIONALS AND STUDENTS SUPPORT STAFF IN ORDER TO ALIGN AND RESTRUCTURING INSTITUTIONS AND MODELS THAT BEST SUPPORT. DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT AS WELL AS TRANSFERRING CAREER AND THREE. SO WE NEED SYSTEMIC APPROACHES TO HELPING COLLEGES RETRAIN STAFF INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS I'M IN THE PURSUIT OF STUDENT SUCCESS IN EQUITY. RICK SAMPLE. WERE ALREADY A HISPANIC OR LET LOT NEXT. OF A SUPPORTING SYSTEM I'M I'M ABOUT FORTY PERCENT I THINK IT'S FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE PARTICULAR MOMENT. HOW DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENTS? TO HELP COLLEGES LEARNED NOT TO BE HISPANIC EMERALDS. INSTITUTIONS BUT HAS SPANDEX SERVING INSTITUTIONS THAT KIND OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY NEEDED ACROSS OUR STOCK AND STUDENT SUPPORT. AND HOW CAN THE BEST RECOGNIZE UP BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS. AND AND AND. MODIFIER PRACTICES IT LOCALLY. SECOND OF ALL WE NEED STATEWIDE TECHNOLOGY CREWS INCLUDING CROSS SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED PLANNING. PROGRAM NAVIGATION FOR STUDENTS DATA SHARING AND TRACKING. EXAMPLES CAN INCLUDE ELECTRONIC CATALOGS THAT INTEGRATE WITH CURRICULUM DATA DASHBOARDS THAT CONTRACTS STUDENTS IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL PLAN PROGRESS FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. REFINE WEBSITES FOR EFFICIENT EDUCATIONAL PLANNING AND QUIRK CAREER GOAL SETTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PRIOR LEARNING ASSESSMENT. PROGRAMS FOR ONLINE COUNSELING AN ACADEMIC ADVISING AND TECHNOLOGY FOR JUST IN TIME SUPPORT THAT IS INTEGRATED WITH INSTRUCTIONAL EFFORTS. SO LEADING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHAINS ARE REQUIRE SPECIFIC SKILLS AND COMMUNICATION IN THE EFFECTIVE USE OF DATA AND IMPLEMENTATION BEYOND THE DISCUSSIONS OF WHY THE FRAMEWORK MATTERS. AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THEIR STUDENT SUPPORT STAFF BROADLY NEED SHARED MODELS THAT CAN BE ADAPTED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL ATKINS TO TO SINCE. THE SECOND BROAD POINT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HER HAVING CLEAR STRUCTURAL PATHWAYS FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES AND THE UNIVERSITY. OF CALIFORNIA WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BUILDING CAPACITY FOR LOCAL GUARANTEED ADMISSION AND A PIPELINE AB DEGREE ATTAINMENT. AND THIS IS A FRUSTRATION FOR MANY OF US WE HAVE. THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE SEEN THE DATA FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT MOVE INTO. THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM MANY OF OUR GRADUATES ARE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE THAT START AT THE C. S. USE OR THE UC'S ONCE THEY TRANSFER. AND SO GIVEN THAT THE LARGE POPULATION OF THE STUDENTS IN THE SOCIAL NET THAT WE PROVIDE HOW CAN WE HAVE MORE CAPACITIES OF VERY IMPORTANT POINT. FOR FOR OUR STAFF THAT ARE TRYING TO NEW STUDENTS THROUGH AND HAVE REAL FACTS IN THEIR LIVES. SO WHILE THE ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER OF PROVIDED A PATHWAY AND GUIDED PATHWAYS IS REALLY HELPING US IN THIS EFFORT MANY PROBLEMS REMAIN IN TERM TERMS OF ALIGNMENT ARTICULATION AND PROVIDING A TRUE EFFICIENT PIPELINE. FOR STUDENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM ATTENDING COMMUNICORP COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH A GUARANTEED AND SRI INTO A LOCAL CSU OR YOU SEE I WILL SAY THIS. THAT I HAVE A TWENTY PERCENTAGE POINT GAP OF MY INSTANT. IN TERMS OF. UNDER REPRESENTED. STUDENTS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRANSFER DUE TO NOT HAVING A LOCAL GUARANTEE AT THE INSTITUTION DOWN THE STREET. AND I WILL SAY THAT IF WE ARE ABLE TO MARKET TO STUDENTS THAT ARE INDICATED TWELFTH WHEN WE ARE DOING OUTREACH AND STUDENT SERVICES AND SAY YOU HAVE IF YOU GET THESE DEGREES AT YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU ARE GUARANTEED ENTRY. INTO A CSU OR YOU SEE THAT IS LOCAL THAT WILL CHANGE FOR FAMILIES. IT WILL CHANGE FOR STUDENTS. ARMED SO INTENSIVE PARAMOUNT'S OF LABOR PROVIDED BY STUDENTS SUPPORT STAFF AND COUNSELORS IN TERMS OF CURRICULUM MAPPING ACROSS SYSTEMS AND EDUCATIONAL PLANNING YET MANY STUDENTS STILL END UP WITH A LESS THAN SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE. WHEN TRANSFERRING INSTITUTIONS DUE TO A LACK OF INTERSECT MENTAL AGREEMENT. SO RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE INTENSIVE BRAND IN OF A STATEWIDE PIPELINE OF SUCCESS FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE CSU AND YOU SEE. A RE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE ARTICULATION PRODUCT PROCESS INCLUDING BROCK INERT BROUGHT INTERSECT MENTAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ENGENDERING OR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROMOTES MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LOWER DIVISION IN ROMANCE AND MORE CAPACITY AND THE CSU AND UC'S FOR UPPER DIVISION COURSES. TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR STATEWIDE CROSS SYSTEM AND EDUCATIONAL PLANNING AND GUARANTEED ENTRY INTO LOCAL UNIVERSITIES. THIRD POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS ABOUT REDESIGNING THE SUPPORT FOR AFFECTED BY SEEN AT SCALE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STE INSTITUTIONS I'M A MEDIUM SIZE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE SERVE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN TERMS OF OUR HEAD COUNT. THERE ARE MANY THAT ARE MUCH HOW MUCH HIGHER. AND THERE'S A LOT OF CAPACITY THAT'S NEEDED IN TERMS OF ADVISING STUDENTS. THE GREAT NEED PROVIDE EFFECTIVELY ADVISING THAT SCALE CURRENTLY COUNSELORS PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PLANNING A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES COLLEGES INCLUDING ACADEMIC PERSONAL AND CAREER COUNSELLING. AND. NOW COUNSELORS ARE BEING ASKED TO COMPLETE MORE TRANSFERS IN CAREER SERVICES ARE GIVEN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS THAT WE HAVE FROM OUR OUR CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT INITIATIVE. BUT MANY COLLEGES HAVE COUNSELORS TO STUDENT RATIOS OF ONE TO OVER A THOUSAND. AND THE SYSTEM IS NOT CURRENTLY DESIGNED PERFORMED COUNSELING SERVICES AT SCALE. FUNDING AND HIRING COUNSELORS IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ON CAMPUSES WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE FIFTY PERCENT LAW. I'M SO EITHER MORE MORE. FUNDING FOR CANCERS THIS NEEDED OR STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY NEED TO OCCUR THAT COULD ENABLE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO COLLABORATIVELY WE THINK FORMS OF ACADEMIC ADVISING. IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS. THEIR ACADEMIC ADVISING MODELS I USED SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA IN STATE SYSTEMS LIKE YOU SEE OR CS YOU. ADDITIONALLY STUDENTS CIRQUE SENATE EDUCATIONAL PLANNING FOR STUDENTS MOVING THROUGH SYSTEMS AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE INTER SEGMENTAL TECHNOLOGY. MAY WARRANT INVESTIGATION AND INVESTMENT. THE LAST POINT IS THIS WE NEED MORE INCREASED FUNDING THE HOLISTICALLY MEETS STUDENT NEEDS. I'M GIVEN THE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE ACROSS ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A MAP OF WHERE THEY ARE SERVING STUDENTS. YOU CAN TELL THAT WE HAVE INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY AND NEED FOR FOR LOCAL POPULATIONS. THE OPEN ACCESS MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. PLAQUES. REQUIRES THE CONNECTEDNESS OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND AN AGENDA OF SERVING OUR MOST IN NEED SERVICES AS DID INDEED STUDENTS HOLISTICALLY. IN ORDER TO OUT TO ACHIEVE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL GOALS THE SYSTEM NEEDS CLEAR FINANCIAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH. HEALTH SERVICES BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITIES TRANSPORTED TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AND HOUSING AND SECURITIES DISABILITY SERVICES AND INCREASED SERVICES FOR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED STEEP POP UP POPULATIONS. JEFF ACTIVELY SERVE HIGH NEED STUDENTS AND INCREASED COMPLETION RATES PERHAPS THE STUDENT NEEDS A FUNNY MODEL THAT SUPPORTS ADDITIONAL CLASSIFIED PERSONNEL. AND ALSO FACULTY ADVISING DUTIES IN ADDITION TO TEACHING LOADS. WE WOULDN'T WEEK WE NEED FUNDING FOR IT INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS TUTORING AND SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET INSIDE OF THE CURRENT BUDGET STRUCTURES THAT WE HAVE. THE DIFFICULTY REMAINS TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS ADDRESS INTENTIONALLY INTERVENE AND FOLLOW UP WITH STUDENTS AS THEY ENTER AND MOVED THROUGH THE COLLEGE SYSTEM AND HOLISTIC WAYS. I FIND IT FUNNY COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN PER PER STUDENT IN WAYS THAT ADDRESS PARITY ACROSS THE SYSTEMS. AND MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS IN TERMS OF INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT ISN'T HARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADOPTED TODD MISTER I WILL ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BERMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND GUESS MY NAME IS JOSE AGUILAR AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE LATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN SIXTY OUR STATE DEVELOP A VISIONARY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION KNOWN AS THE MASTER PLAN. MUCH HAS CHANGED IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE INCIDENT DECADES. POPULATION GROWTH INCREASED DIVERSE CITY. CHANGING LEAD IN INDUSTRIES AND THEIR NEED FOR TALENT. AS WELL AS INNOVATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE FEEL OF EDUCATION EXCEPT. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MASTER PLAN IS THAT IT CAN BE COMPARED TO A THREE LEGGED STOOL. ONE LEG REPRESENTS THE. YOU NEED A COLLEGE SYSTEM ONE LEG RISK REPRESENTS THE. CSU SYSTEM. AND THE. ONE LABOR HAS THE UC SYSTEM ALL THREE LEGS SUPPORT AND HOLD THE SEAT PORTION OF THE STOOL. STUDENTS. SEEKING A DEGREE ARE AND AND. NEED OF THAT SEAT IN MY OPINION. THAT SEED. OF THE STOOL REPRESENTS A SUPPORT SERVICES THAT STUDENTS DO SERVE AND REQUIRED TO SUCCEED IN OBTAINING A DEGREE. EXAMPLE OF THESE SERVICES ARE ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES. ADMISSIONS FINANCIAL AID. CAREER AND INVESTMENT SERVICES HOUSING FOOD IS AND SOCIAL SAFETY NETS PROGRAMS. HELP IN AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND MANY MORE SERVICES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE DIRECT TEACHING AND RESEARCH MISSION OFFERED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT THE LARGEST RESOURCE IN UNIVERSITIES STATE IN THE WORLD WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND MATRICULATED STUDENTS. HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR. FACULTY AND STAFF IN ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION LIVING ALUMNI. IT INCLUDES TEN CAMPUSES FIVE MEDICAL CENTERS. AND THREE AFFILIATED NATIONAL LABORATORIES YOU SEE REMAINS COMMITTED TO CARRYING OUT THIS RESEARCH EDUCATION. HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC SERVICE MISSIONS. STRENGTHENING THE PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY. TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE AND SURVIVE AN ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION. STAY FUNDING THIS KEY AND CRITICAL TO ENSURE ADEQUATE. SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OUR GROWING STUDENT POPULATION. AT YOU SEE OUR LOAN WE RECEIVE MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE OF FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER APPLICATIONS. FOR EVERY YEAR TO FILL APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED SEATS. THE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED HE'S JOINED YOU SEE US CONTINUE STUDENT POPULATION TO COMPRISE A TOTAL. POPULATION OF APPROXIMATE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS. THIS TOTAL AND ROLL POPULATION ASSEMBLY INCREASES YEAR AFTER YEAR. DEPENDING ON INSTITUTIONAL TIGERS AND STUDENT ACCEPTANCE THIS. FOR EXAMPLE TEN YEARS AGO THE TOTEM ROLL POPULATION THAT YOU SEE ARE. APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE AND ENROLL STUDENTS IN THE LAST DECADE. INCREASES THE STAFFING HAVE NOT KEPT UP TO THE STUDENT GROWTH LEVELS. FOR EXAMPLE IT JUST ALONG IN MY FINANCIAL AID OFFICE WE HAD A STAFF OF TWENTY EIGHT. FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. SURF. STUDENTS. OF THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS. WHEN COMPARED TO THE STAFF TEN YEARS AGO THAT TRANSLATES TO A SIXTY PERCENT INCREASE IN STAFF. OVER THE TEN YEARS. OTHER TWENTY EIGHT STAFF MEMBERS. NINE I DECIMATED THE FINANCIALLY COUNSELORS WHO ARE ABLE TO SERVE OUR TOTAL STUDENT POPULATION WHICH HAS. A COMPLEX AND UNIQUE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS TRANSLATES TO A TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TO ONE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID THE STUDENT TO FINANCIALLY COUNSELOR RATIO. TEN YEARS AGO. I'D EIGHT FINANCIALLY COUNSELORS AVAILABLE TO SERVE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT REYES WHO WAS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIX STILL HIGH. BUT IT. IT WHEN LOOKING AT THAT AND DOING A COMPARISON. THERE'S. THE STUDENT TO FINANCE LABOR ACCOUNTS SERRATIA INCREASED BY THREE HUNDRED FORTY STUDENTS. WE ARE. REGULARLY ASKED TO DO MORE WITH LESS AN APPETIZER SO THE STAFF WORKING OVERTIME. TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR STUDENTS EXCESS OVER TIME I THINK KOSTAS STEPPED BURNOUT THAT THEN LEADS TO STAFF TURNOVER. THE CHALLENGE IS NOT UNIQUE YOU SEE ARE I REGULARLY ME WITH OTHER YOU SEE FINANCIALLY DIRECTORS TO COLLABORATE ON VARIOUS TOPICS AND ISSUES RELATED TO FINANCIALLY. AT THIS MEETING AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT HE NEEDS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WERE SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR RESPECT THE STUDENT BODIES. FOR THE MORE I LIKE TO AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS ALSO A CHALLENGE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. NOT A IT IS NOT YOU H. HOUSE YOU NEED TO THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE. IN ADDITION TO ADEQUATE STAFF AND WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THE STAFF. ARE. THE STAFF ARE ETHICALLY CUP COMPENSATED STAFF SALARIES MUST BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I OFTENTIMES I LOSE WELL TRAINED AND COUNT TO STAFF TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS DUE TO LOW SALARIES. ADEQUATE FACILITIES SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENTS ALSO COUNTRY TWIST THAT MEMBERS OVERALL JOB SATISFACTION WHICH TRANSLATES TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. TO LIKE. CAMPUS COMMUNITY. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS ALSO KEY A KEY FACTOR IN ASSISTANCE STAFF IN THE CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF ACQUIRING A NEW IT. A KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT RELATE TO THEIR PROFESSION DRIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OR WORK ENVIRONMENT. INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION NEED TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND PROVIDE MORE SELF SERVICE MEN USED TO STUDENTS. STOOLS THESE TOOLS SHOULD BE MITIGATES MEDICAID HIGH VOLUME PHONE CALLS AND OFFICE VISITS. FOR EXAMPLE ENHANCE PHONE SYSTEMS AND WEB TOOLS WERE REGULAR BENEFITS STUDENTS AND PREVENT THEM FROM WAITING ON HOLD FOR THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES IT REPRESENTED TO BE AVAILABLE DURING HIGH PEAK TIMES. UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT STAFF BASIS ALSO IMPORTANT. YOU SEE RISK WE CONDUCT THE STAFF ENGAGEMENT SURVEY WHICH HAS HELPED YOU SEE ARE IDENTIFY ERISA STRENGTH. POSITIVE WORK POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH SUPERVISORS AND ASKED OF ATTENTION. FOR EXAMPLE WORKLOAD AND CHANGE AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT. AS AN INSTITUTION IT IS VITAL FOR US. TO COLLABORATE WITH STAFF TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS AND OTHER THEIR RESPECTIVE. PERSPECTIVE AND IN AN IMPROVING EFFICIENCIES OF OUR CSUS. MY RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMITTEE IS THAT THE MASTER PLAN IS SURE THE STATE. PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDING AND RESOURCES FOR STAFF TO SUPPORT STUDENT GROWTH. INCREASED CAPACITY AND ADDRESS DETERIORATED INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY UNDER EXISTING CAMPUSES. DO THEY STUDENTS THEY SERVE THE SAME QUALITY EDUCATION ASSN PAST GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT WE MUST PROVIDE STUDENTS AND STAFF. WITH THE CLASSROOMS THE LAVATORIES THE LIBRARIES. AND THE LIVING AND LEARNING SPACES THEY NEED TO THRIVE AND SUCCEED. AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVERY FACULTY AND STAFF MEMBER PLACE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ADVANCE IS YOU SEE MISSION OF EDUCATION. RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE MY PERSPECTIVE AN ASSOCIATE OF RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE YOU VERY MUCH YOUR. I'LL I'LL START I YOU KNOW. THIS OUR FOURTH HEARING AT THE MENTION OF THE START IN THE LAST HEARING THAT WE HAD WAS ON ON STUDENT NEEDS AND STUDENT SERVICES REALLY. AND. IT MADE ME APPRECIATE SO MUCH MORE. THE ROLE THAT OUR. STUDENT SERVICES STAFF IN THE WHOLE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY ECOSYSTEM. THE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT ECOSYSTEM TESTING SIX. AND AND INVESTMENT. IN. STUDENTS STAFF SERVICES IS SO CRITICAL FOR TODAY'S STUDENTS ESPECIALLY AS SO MANY MORE ARE FACING CHALLENGES OF FOOD INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS. AND LACK OF ACCESS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AND IT'S REALLY FROM JUST BEEN EYE OPENING FOR ME YEAH HEARING THE STORIES FROM STUDENTS. THAT WE HAVE OVER THE PAST. I'M ONLY BEEN THE LEGISLATURE FOR YEAR AND A HALF BUT JIMMY DEAN IS BEEN THERE FOR LONGER. YOU KNOW AT IT MAKES ME APPRECIATE. THE NEED FOR IT FOR MORE INVESTMENT. YOU BOTH ANSWERED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD BUT I GUESS ONE THAT I ASK. IS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S ONE THING THAT. YOU WISH OUR CALLINGS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT STUDENT SERVICES STAFF WHEN WE'RE CRAFTING POLICY. OF FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR THE NEXT. COUPLE GENERATION. WELL. NO MYSELF I THINK. WE'RE GOING THROUGH AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF CHANGE AT OUR INSTITUTIONS AND SOME OF THE THE THE QUESTION THAT'S THAT'S OUT HIS FOR SO LONG. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS FILL OUR CLASSES WITH ENROLLMENT WE'VE ALSO WAITED FOR STUDENTS MANY TIMES TO SHOW UP TO FIND PLACES ON CAMPUS TO? TO GET SUPPORT. AND THERE'S BEEN A BEEN A REAL SHIFT I THINK THE LAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS ABOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE INTENTIONALLY. GO AFTER AND WORK WITH STUDENTS IN NEW WAYS AND THAT AND THAT HAS HAS HAS BEEN LARGELY AN EFFORT THAT'S AROUND EQUITY. THINKING ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS ARE DOING ON ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND SO THIS THIS CHANGE FROM MOVING FROM ENROLLMENT TO SUCCESS AS THE FOCUS A OF OUR COLLEGES IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE WERE. IT NOT THAT WE WERE DOING THAT ALL ALONG BUT THE WAY IN WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PERHAPS BEING FUNDED. AYE HAS HAS STARTED NEW CONVERSATIONS ON OUR CAMPUSES SO. WHAT THAT LEAVES US WITH THIS BEAR DECADES OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE RUN PERSONNEL AND HAVE HAD STOCK IN PER PARTICULAR LOCATIONS ON OUR CAMPUS? AND THIS MEANS MAJOR TRANSFORM TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE FOR OUR LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND HOW DO WE BEST PROVIDE. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO SERVE STUDENTS BETTER. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO BEST BUT WORK ON EQUITY BEING. IN IN INCOME INCLUSIVITY ON OUR CAMPUSES HOW DO WE BEST WORK WITH. PARENTS AND FAMILIES HOW DO WE BEST SERVE NOW ON IN A MUCH MORE A MERCHANT A WORK FORCE AN ADULT LEARNERS THAT ARE TRYING TO ACCESS OUR CAMPUSES. IT MEANS REALLY RESTRUCTURING OUR STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES SO THE KINDS OF FUNDING AND THE KIND OF ATTENTION AND I THINK THAT ADMINISTRATION AND SUPPORT STAFF NEED. ARE ARE DEVELOPING MODELS THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY USE THAT CAMPUSES AND HOW BROAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO TRANSFORM ON THE CAMERA'S RIGHT AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT BETTER? AND WE CAN IT'S INTERESTING WE HAVE THREE SILOS. I'M ON THESE PANELS AND WE'RE NOT WE NEED TO THINK TOO ABOUT HOW WE WORK ACROSS OUR SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW JUST HOW WE CAN INTENTIONALLY DOING ON OUR CAMPUS HOW WE CAN TO PROVIDE STUDENTS. WITH SYSTEMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT STUDENTS CAN THINK ABOUT POINT A TO POINT Z. AT ENDING AT A YOU SEE OR ANY POLICY S. YOU SO THEY CAN SEE THEIR ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL PLAN AND NEEDS TO BE SEAMLESS. AND MANY DEVELOP PROCESSES AND WAITS FOR STUDENTS TO MEET THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS EASILY AS A LOT OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE AND MONEY NEEDS TO BE. FUNDED REPORTS THAT OVER THE NEXT AT LEAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS AS WE TRANSITION. YEAH I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH WITH THAT. THE COMMENTS AND NOW ALSO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AS AS WELL IS THAT AS WE. I IN TERMS OF SERVICES AS WE GROW MORE AS A STUDENT ROMAN GIRLS ARE THERE MORE SERVICES REQUIRE OTHER THAN THE CORE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE MENTAL HEALTH. AT SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT YOU YOU HAD MENTIONED AS WELL AS. THAT YOU KNOW. THE NIECE OF BASIC NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ALL THOSE RESOURCES. WE NEED TIME AND INCLUDE THAT WHEN WE'RE HAVING THOSE DISCUSSES A SPARSE POLICY AND ALSO LOOK AT POLICY. THAT IS PREVENTING FROM US MOVING FORWARD TO TO SERVICE THE STUDENTS TO ADEQUATELY SOMETIMES WERE MORE WRAPPED UP. AND MEETING THAT COMPLIANCE IN THE POLICY REQUIREMENTS FROM THE STATE AS WELL AS FROM THE GOD OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT YOU KNOW WE. TEND TO LOSE THE BABY OFFERING THAT'S THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE TO THE STUDENT THEY REALLY NEED AND WHEN A STUDENT COMES TO MY OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T WHEN THEY COME AT A HIGH SCHOOL THAT WILL COME OUT WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL. WITH FINANCIAL AID EDUCATION THEN THERE IS SOMETHING NEW TO THE UNIVERSITY OR TO THE STUDENT AND THE FAMILY. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT EACH COMPLEX OFF FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE STUDENTS FINDS HIMSELF. WE NEED TO PROVIDE THAT'S LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WHERE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE. AND THEY FEEL. EMPOWERED TO MAKE THE DECISION TO COME TO THE UNIVERSITY AND LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW THE FUTURE EXPENSIVE THEY HAVE IN FRONT OF THEM. NOW REALLY APPRECIATE BOTH YOUR COMMENTS AND AND NOW DOCTOR JUST CALL FROM CSU DURING HIS HOUSE CAN BE YEAR. SOUGHT TO SAY THAT I THINK GERMANY THE AMOUNT OF BEEN WITH ME. WE TOOK A TOUR OF CSU DOMINGUEZ HILLS AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS PROACTIVE. NOW YOU KNOW OUR REACH IN THAT THAT THEY DO AND USING TECHNOLOGY IDENTIFY WHEN THEY'RE RED FLAGS IN FIRST JUNE. AND FIND IT YOU KNOW SEEING THAT WHEN IT HAPPENS IN THE PROVIDING THAT STUDENT WITH A LITTLE SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE IT WILL SUBMIT A HELP. THAT AT THAT POINT RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL IT GETS WORSE AND THERE ARE RISK OF DROPPING OUT SO YOU KNOW USING TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY. YOU KNOW WHEN THE STUDENT IS STRUGGLING AND AND WHAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT BE PROVIDED FOR THEM CAN SAVE A LOT OF OF MONEY AND TIME AND HEART ACHE. DOWN THE ROAD. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED A. TRY TO GET BETTER AT DOING SO. AND IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GAIN MORE EFFICIENCIES THERE AND BE MORE TRANSPARENT WITH STUDENTS AND I THINK. THE GLOBAL INTERSECT MENTAL APPROACH AGAIN ISN'T IT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE STOCK PIPELINE LOOK LIKE AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO. GET BACK TO AN IDEA THAT. THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED OF FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AT THAT ARE SERVING STUDENTS THAT ALSO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE THROUGH YOUR FINISHED A BACHELOR'S DEGREES ABSOLUTELY. NOPE DOT ORG WITH THAT. PLEASE. THANK THE PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AND OUR LAST PANEL. OF OF THE HEARING IS GOING TO BE THE NEEDS OF STAFF. FOR UNION PERSPECTIVE I'D LIKE TO WELCOME BILL RAWLINGS COMPUTER FACILITIES COORDINATOR AND CHAIR OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE COMMITTEE. OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. VICKI MACLEOD IT BUDGET SPECIALIST AND VICE CHAIR OF WHAT IS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AT THE CSU M. AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES UNION. AND CHRISTINE STOCKY SENIOR CUSTODIAN ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE REPRESENTATIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. TODAY. AND IT BILL IF YOU WANNA KICK US OFF THEIR THING. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS BILL RAWLINGS I'M A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS. AND I'VE BEEN A CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE AT MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION CSEA. CCA REPRESENTS OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. I AM THE CHAIR OF THE CSEA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR THOUGHTS AND PERSPECTIVE ON HOW TO MAKE OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM BETTER. SPECIFICALLY I WAS ESTA FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF CLASSIFIED STAFF IN THREE AREAS SO FIRST. WHAT WE NEED TO BETTER SUPPORT STUDENTS? CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE THE EXTRAORDINARY WORKERS WHO DO THE ESSENTIAL WORK TO KEEP A COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CLEAN SAFE AND FUNCTIONAL. WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERY STUDENT FACULTY ADMINISTRATOR INVESTOR HAVE AN ENJOYABLE AND EFFECTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT TO PURSUE THEIR ACADEMIC CAREER AND LIFE GOALS. LIKE ANY PROFESSION BETTER PAY HELPS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN BETTER PROFESSIONALS AND MORE STAFFING WILL ENSURE THAT ADDITIONAL VITAL SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED ADEQUATELY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. FROM THE MOMENT THAT A STUDENT FIRST VENTURES ON CAMPUS TO THE DAY THAT THE GRADUATE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION JOURNEY. IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES STUDENTS TING MANY SERVICES TO SUCCEED. HAVING MORE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ON CAMPUS MEANS BEING ABLE TO DELIVER MORE SERVICES TO STUDENTS INCLUDING MORE FINANCIAL AID SERVICES MORE RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. COUNSELING TUTORING HEALTHCARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT CAMPUS SAFETY JOB PLACEMENT SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FEW. BUT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT OUR MEMBERS REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR IS TO GET MORE TRAINING AND ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT I THINK THIS IS A THEME WE'VE HEARD A BIT TODAY. IN THIS EVER CHANGING WORLD WE WANT AND NEED TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO CONTINUOUSLY UPGRADE OUR SKILLS AND LEARN BEST PRACTICES TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY. TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS INCREASES IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION CURRICULA FORMS AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS AND DANGER REQUIRES TO A PETER SKILLS AND KEEP UP WITH CHANGING TIMES. FOR EXAMPLE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTIPLE MEASURES FOR ASSESSMENT. WHO REQUIRE MANY OF ARE ECONOMIC TO SUPPORT STAFF? TO ADAPT TO THE INCREASED IN A TRANSFER LEVEL STUDENTS. SO WITHOUT ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE LATEST INFORMATION AND SKILLS TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS. SECOND. WHERE THE CHOSEN BARRIERS CLASSIFIED STAFF IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND HOW ARE THESE ADDRESSED? WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO STOP OR MINIMIZE THE REPEATED USE OF SHORT TERM INTEMPERATE PLOYS WERE OFTEN MINIMALLY TRAINED AND SKILLED. AS A WAY TO AVOID PROVIDING HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES. MANY COLLEGES HIGHER NON PERMANENT CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SUCH AS STUDENT WORKER SHORT TERM WORKERS EXTENDED SUBSTITUTES AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTS IN LIEU OF HIRING MORE PERMANENT CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. CERTAIN CONDITIONS EXIST TO WARRANT THE USE OF HIS TEMPORARY SHORT TERM EMPLOYEES TO FILL A LIMITED TEMPORARY ME. HOWEVER THE NEED TRULY SHOULD BE LIMITED AND THEY SHOULD NOT OUTNUMBER THE NUMBER OF PERMANENT CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE'VE SEEN AN ENFORCER PATTERN WERE SOME DISTRICTS HAVE DEVELOPED THE PRACTICE OF HIRING SHORT TERM EMPLOYEES FOR ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR DAYS. LAYING THEM OFF AND THEN RE HIRING THEM FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THIS PRACTICE IS REPEATED YEAR AFTER YEAR CIRCUMVENTING THE ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DAYS ROLE THEREBY DENYING THESE EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS LEAVES HOLIDAYS AND ALL OF THE RIGHTS OF CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. ALSO SOME COLLEGES HIGHER MULTIPLE PART TIME CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES INSTEAD OF FEWER FULL TIME CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS AND SHIPPING TO CALPERS OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM. SOME POSITIONS MAY BE SUED WAS PART TIME POSITIONS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WORK. HOWEVER WHEN THE WORK CAN BE DONE BY ONE PERSON AND A FULL TIME POSITION WE'D PREFER THAT HAPPENED VERSUS PUTTING THE WORK BETWEEN TWO PART TIME POSITIONS. TO AVOID PAYING THE HEALTH AND. WE BELIEVE FULL TIME POSITIONS ENCOURAGE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES BE MORE COMMITTED TO THEIR JOB. MORE INVESTED IN THE OUTCOMES THEY HELPED PRODUCE WITH OUR STUDENTS AND MORE ENGAGE IN THE CAMPUS CULTURE THEREBY PROMOTING A CONSISTENT WORKFORCE INSTEAD OF CONSTANT TURNING. HIGH TURNOVER AND MULTIPLE VACANCIES CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED WORKLOAD ON THE REMAINING STAFF WHICH SOMETIMES RESULTS IN DECREASED ACCESS AND SERVICES TO STUDENTS. AND DECREASED EMPLOYEE MORALE. PROTECTING EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND BENEFITS CONTINUE TO BE A POTENTIAL KEY BARRIER AND CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF OUR MEMBERS. THIRD HOW SHOULD THE MASTER PLAN MEET THE NEEDS OF STAFF WHAT IS ONE ACTIONS TAKEN TAKE THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE FUNDING. AND ONE ACTION THAT THE STATE CAN TAKE A THAT WOULD REQUIRE FRONT. THEIR STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT COLLABORATION BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT ADVOCATES WHO TWELVE CAMPUS LEADS TO BETTER STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. OUR CURRENT STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TORRANCE AND HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA THROUGH HIS LABOR MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE. IT BRINGS TOGETHER THE SCHOOL BOARD THE FACT THE CLASSIFIED UNION SEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS BUDGET ISSUES AND CAMPUS ISSUES. THE DISCUSSIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS AMICABLE BUT THROUGH RESPECT AND COMMUNICATION. THE RESULTANT IMPACT ON STUDENTS ARE CLEAR THE GRADES IMPROVE. IN SOME WAYS IT'S ALMOST COMMON SENSE THAT WHEN ALL EDUCATORS RECORDED IN THEIR MISSION STUDENTS BENEFIT. IT IS THIS NOTION OF SHARED GOVERNANCE I BELIEVE WILL MAKE OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BETTER FOR STUDENTS. IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE IDEA PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE PERMEATES FROM THE STATE LEVEL FROM THE CONSULTATION COUNCIL OR DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL IN AND BUT COMMITTEE. I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER BUILDING THE FUTURE MASTER PLAN A CALL FOR SHARED GOVERNANCE BETWEEN BOARD MEMBERS ADMINISTRATORS FACTLY AND CLASSIFIED STAFF. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO PACIFIC WE HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE WORKERS AS A MEMBER AND PARTICIPANT IN THE SHARED GOVERNANCE PROCESS. WE MAY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS BUT OUR COMMON GOAL IS THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS. ALSO INCLUDING US IN THE SHARED GOVERNANCE PROCESS HAS MINIMAL TO NO FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS. BUT WHAT CAN WE DO IF WE HAD MORE FUNDING. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE GO BACK TO LOOK AT MORE FULL TIME STAFFING. AS WELL AS IMPROVE PAIN BENEFITS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO RETAIN OUR HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES. HAVING DEDICATED AND ENGAGED EMPLOYEES IS A NECESSARY INVESTMENT IN OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOR THE DIRECT IMPACT ON STUDENTS TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND. THANK YOU BILL OF VICKI MACLEOD YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. FOR INVITING CSU YOU HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT OUR EMPLOYEES THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR WEBER. I'M I'D LIKE TO START OFF MY NAME'S VICKI I AM HERE TODAY REPRESENTING SEE ISSUE EMPLOYEES UNION THAT WE REPRESENT SIXTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. AND I'M ALSO AN EMPLOYEE AT CAL STATE FULLERTON. BEEN THERE SEVEN YEARS AND ALSO WORKED AT CAL POLY POMONA FOR TWENTY FOUR SIDE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. THE SUPPORT STAFF OF THE CS YOU ARE THE BACKBONE EN BANC BRAIN TRUST OF THE UNIVERSITY BUT WERE OFTEN OVERLOOKED. THE FIRST INNER ACTION AS STUDENT EXPERIENCES WHEN CALLING ARE WALKING INTO A CSU OFFICE IS WHAT THE STAFF MEMBER. THE SERVICE PROVIDED TO STUDENTS PARENTS AND OFTEN ON CAMPUS COMMUNITY IS THOROUGH AND BODIES A CARING CHARACTERISTIC TO PROMOTE THE CSU MISSION STATEMENT. OF INVESTING IN OUR STUDENTS TO PREPARE PREPARE THEM TO ENTER THE COMMUNITY AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. MANY EMPLOYEES HAVE WORKED AT A CSU CAMPUS FOR FOR YEARS. IN ORDER TO ASSIST STUDENTS SUPPORT STAFF POSITIONS SHOULD BE FULLY FUNDED AND EMPLOYEES NEED TO MOVE THROUGH THE SALARY RANGE TO RETAIN CAMPUS WORKFORCE. SEE IF YOU YOU IS ACTUALLY SPONSORING A BILL WITH DR I WEBER IT'S ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE THIRTY ONE. AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT EMPLOYEES RECEIVED FURLOUGHS AND LAYOFFS FOLLOWED NUMEROUS POSITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN FILLED SON FAN BUT THE REMAINING EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO ASSUME THE DUTIES OF THE VACANT POSITIONS. STAFF ARE COMMONLY TOLD TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS VACANT POSITIONS DO NOT INCLUDE AND SALARY INCREASE. STAFF AREN'T IMPORTANT COMMUNITY PLAYER AND DEDICATED TO SERVING STUDENTS WHERE THE TRUST THAT MANAGEMENT THAT MANAGES IMPORTANT TASK. I ENROLLING STUDENTS IN CLASSES. HIRING STUDENT WORKERS KEEPING OUR CAMPUSES CLEAN. RUNNING THE FRONT OFFICE HANDLING BUDGETARY FINANCIAL AND TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE SUPPORTING FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS AND CARING FOR STUDENTS. WE SHARED GOALS TO BILL SOLUTIONS TO BETTER OUR STUDENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATUS FOR MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES IS GRAHAM AND DURING THE FIFTH FURLOUGHS THE TASK OF TAKING TWO JOBS WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR OUR EMPLOYEES TO MAKE ENDS MEET. MANY STAFF LOST THEIR HOMES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT STUDENTS FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS AND THE PUBLIC KNOW THE CHALLENGES THAT STAFF FACE. OUR DEDICATED EMPLOYEES TREAT THIS ISSUE CAMPUS AS THEIR HOME AWAY FROM HOME. THE COMMITMENT AND DEVOTION OUR STAFF REPRESENT DALY IS COMPATIBLE TO BEING A PROUD MOTHER. PARENT I AM THE PROUD MOTHER BECAUSE MY STUDENT GRADUATED FROM CSU FULLERTON TWO YEARS AGO. DEATH WANT STUDENTS TO SUCCEED AND ACCOMPLISH THEIR DRAIN WITH A DEGREE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. WE FACE MANY CHALLENGES WE WEAR MANY HATS. EMPLOYEES AS I MENTIONED HAVE RETIRED THE POSITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN REPLACED. ACCEPTING ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND COMMITTING TO HIRING DIVERSE FACULTY IS SUPPORTED BY STAFF. BUT OUR EMPLOYEES TEND TO NOT BE MENTIONED. THERE IS A VOID IN ADDRESSING THE NEED TO INCREASE STAFF POSITIONS. SUPPORT STAFF SHOULD BE INCLUDED WHEN DIALOGUE TAKES PLACE THAT AFFECTS THE CAMPUS SO THAT EMPLOYEES CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE STUDENTS PRODUCTIVELY. MANY DEPARTMENTS ON CAMPUS HOUSE ONE STAFF MEMBER TO ASSIST A LARGE STUDENT AND FACULTY POPULATION. SUPPORT STAFF ARE THE FRONTLINE IN THE FIRST CONTACT STUDENT INNER ACTS WITH ONE BEING ADMITTED. WE GIVE THEM GUIDANCE AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE ENROLLED IN CLASSES LEARNING THE DEPARTMENT AND FACULTY AND UNDERSTANDING THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF EACH CAMPUS. STAFF CREATE ORGANIZE COLLABORATE PRIORITIZE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT DIED AND MONITOR STUDENTS TOWARDS THEIR EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. THE MASTER PLAN. AND THE CALIFORNIA SITE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE KNOWLEDGE EXPERTISE LONGEVITY AND DEDICATION THAT STAFF SUPPLY TO THE CSU CAMPUSES. THERE ARE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR CAREER WE ENCOURAGE FAMILY TO ATTEND TO SEE ISSUE AND RETREAT THIS ISSUE OUR EMPLOYMENT AS FAMILY. THE ISSUE YOU HAS REQUESTED TO HAVE A SUPPORT STAFF SEAT ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WE'VE DONE THIS THREE TIMES TO THREE DIFFERENT BILLS AND IT'S BEEN VETOED. THERE IS A STUDENT AND ALUMNI AND THE FACULTY REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES BUT NO STAFF DELEGATE. ALLOWING INPUT FROM SUPPORT STAFF. WOULD GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY AN INSIGHT FROM THE PERSON WHO WORKS DALY AND INNER ACTS WITH STUDENTS TO GIVE CONCERNS AND ISSUES. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER CSU A SPONSORING A BILL BY DOCTOR WEBER IS THE AUTHOR IT'S AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE AND THAT IS TO RESOURCE RESTORE SALARY STEPS FOR SUPPORT STAFF. THIS WOULD BRING BACK A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE BASED ON AN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM SUPPORT STAFF OF THIS ISSUE NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO. THE BILL WILL RE ESTABLISH PARITY WITH ALL OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND PARITY WITH THE HALF MILLION STATE EMPLOYEES WHO ALREADY HAVE SALARY STEPS. THIS WAS HEARD IN THE ASSEMBLY FOREIGN AND IT WAS PASSED AND I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF MEDINA AND BERMAN FOR VOTING YES ON OUR BILL. AND IT WILL BE HEARD ON MAY NINTH IN THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT TREND OF NEWLY HIRED SUPPORT STAFF LEADING THE C. S. YOU DUE TO NO MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SALARY RANGE. BY NOT RETAIN THE EMPLOYEES THE DUTIES ONCE AGAIN FALL ON THE REMAINING EMPLOYEES AS INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN MEMORY. RETENTION IS AN ISSUE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND THERE IS A DISSERVICE TO OUR STUDENTS. THERE'S ALSO. AN INVERSION SO MANY EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN THERE SUCH AS MYSELF FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS WE HAVE NEWLY EMPLOYEES THAT ARE BEING HIRED BUT HIRED AT A HIGHER SALARY. AND THAT CAUSES A MORALE ISSUE AMONG STAFF. IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER ED COMMITTEE AND THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION HELD A SPECIAL HEARING. TO REVIEW THE STATE AUDIT OF THE CSU PERSONNEL AND BUDGET PRACTICES. THE AUDIT WAS RELEASED IN APRIL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE ARCTIC DEMONSTRATED THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND STAFF POSITIONS. THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER ED COMMITTEE HEARD AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE IN JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND IT WAS SUGGESTED BY SENATOR ROCK THAT THE CS CONDUCT AND EMPLOYMENT SURVEY TO DETERMINE IF THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSING THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF MANAGEMENT POSITIONS. AGAINST FACULTY AND STAFF POSITIONS. THIS SURVEY WOULD DETERMINE IF THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ARE HIRED TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE OUR STUDENT POPULATION. THE SURVEY IS AN ACTION THE STATE CAN TAKE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT REQUIRE FUNDING. THE UNIVERSITIES CONTINUE TO FUNCTION TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND STAFF ARE EMPLOYED TWELVE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR. WE REMAIN ON CAMPUS ONCE THE SEMESTER CONCLUDES DURING DECEMBER BREAK SPRING BREAK AND SUMMER SESSION. WE SUPPORT STUDENTS MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY EIGHT TO FIVE MANY OF THEM OR EMPLOYEES. WORK OVERTIME TO JUST SERVE OUR STUDENTS. EMPLOYEES KNOW THAT OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I JUST HAD AN ADVANTECH CAL STATE FULLERTON YESTERDAY IN REGARDING OUR CAMPUS MASTER PLAN AND IT WAS. KIND OF STRUCTURING THE SAME TALKS THAT ARE HERE TODAY AS NOT ONLY ON HOW TO SERVE STEVE STUDENTS BUT ALSO OUR FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE ON OUR CAMPUS. THOUGH AGAIN I WANNA THANK YOU FOR INVITING SEIZE YOU EMPLOYEES UNION TODAY TO GIVE OUR FOCUS AND INPUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HUMAN CLOUD AND NEXT WE HAVE CHRISTIAN. YES.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BERMAN AND THEM MR MEDINA. MY NAME SOME ASSEMBLY LINE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE ARE THE ORGANIZATIONAL VOICE FOR I NOW EIGHTY A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING LOCALLY HERE ARE CAL BAPTIST UNIVERSITY AND LAST YEAR UNIVERSITY. THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT A SECTOR. HAS LONG BEEN A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN. SINCE IT'S DRAFTING IN NINETEEN IN NINETEEN SIXTY AND ALSO WE WERE INTEGRAL IN THE CREATION OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE. A WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A LARGE ROLE IN CREATING STUDENT ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES. ESPECIALLY FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. IN REGARDS TO A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND FACULTY DIVERSITY. MANY PRIVATE NONPROFITS HAVE SUBSTANTIVE FACULTY DIVERSITY PROGRAMS. AND THIS IS A POINT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT SECTOR EDUCATES FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE STATE. THAT'S MORE THAN THIS YES YOU AND YOU SEE COMBINED. AND THESE INCLUDE MASTER'S PROGRAMS PHD PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONAL DEGREES AS WELL. THAT'S SUCH A DON'T KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE ROLE IN EDUCATING THE NEXT GENERATION. OF. PROFESSORS THAT. END UP TEACHING AT A COMMUNICABLE EACH OTHER YOU SEE YOUR S. YES YOU. OR YEAH ALSO WORK IN LOW SOCIO SOCIO ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES. THAT NEED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AND THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT TO STRENGTHEN THESE EFFORTS AND TO STRENGTHEN THAT PIPELINE THAT HAS BEEN REFERRED TO. IN PREVIOUS PANELS. FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO UNDERGRADUATE TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. FOR STUDENTS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THE STATE NEEDS TO FULLY FUND THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. FOR STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THAT. NEED THE CHANCE TO ATTEND. THAT HAVE THE CHOICE TO ATTEND A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGE UNIVERSITY OR A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. AND. NO WELL WE APPRECIATE DEFINITELY. HALTING THE CUTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO GROW THE AWARD IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

THANK THANK YOU TOM ISLAMIST QUICKLY SAY US SOMEONE EARLIER USE A HELPFUL METAPHOR A THREE LEGGED STOOL A AYE WELL ONCE IT'S REALLY MORE LIKE A FOUR LEGGED CHAIR. BECAUSE OUR INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE CRITICAL PARTNER. FOR ALL OF US. IN MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS GET HIGHER EDUCATION. HIGH QUALITY AND EDUCATION MICHELLE CANOE THANK YOU SO MUCH. HI MY NAME IS MICHELLE CANOE AND I'M WITH BLUE EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION WERE BASED AND SALMON MEDINA COUNTY WORKING A LOT EXAMINES YOU KNOW SCHOOLS. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE UP TO YOU BECAUSE OUR ORGANIZATION WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH STUDENTS OF COLOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS YOU OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO STEP FOOT ON THE CAL STATE CAMPUSES. AND THE UC CAMPUSES UNTIL WE ACTUALLY TAKE THEM AND I WANTED TO REITERATE THE VALUE THAT THOSE SUPPORT STAFF OFFER ON THE COMMUNITY CAN'T COLLEGES. AS WELL AS ON THE CS USE IN THE UC CAMPUSES AND PARTICULARLY WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR HOW MUCH IT DOES. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO WANT TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. IN THE ONCE THEY'RE THERE HOW MUCH IT REALLY ENCOURAGES THEM TO STAY IN TO EVENTUALLY GRADUATE SO I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THE REAL VALUE OF THAT. FROM THE K. THROUGH TWELVE ENDS FOR THE ORGANIZATIONS THOSE OF US WORKING WITH THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE REALLY. TRYING TO GET ON TO THESE CAMPUSES AND IN THE LONG LONG BRIAN THAT REALLY BENEFITS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS THE GOAL IS TO EVENTUALLY GRADUATE MORE THE STUDENTS AND CONTRIBUTES YOU A DIVERSE. AND WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE NEXT THAT WE HAVE CARLA OR BONDS YOU CAN THE LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED BY JONATHAN HUGHES. I THINK YOU I'M CARL RPG AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE LABOR AND ASSOCIATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR ALL YOU SEE LIBRARIAN. I'M ALSO A LIBRARIAN HERE AT UC RIVERSIDE AND AN ALUMNI OF YOU SEE ARE AND SOME OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION ARE NOT JUST ABOUT WRITING ACCESS TO WORK THE WORLD'S KNOWLEDGE BUT ABOUT KNOWLEDGE CREATION. LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT WE OFFER TO OUR PATRONS BUT WHAT WE DO FOR THEM TO REALIZE THEIR GOALS WHETHER IT BE COMPLETING A PROGRAMMER DEGREE. DISCOVERING NEW INSIGHTS AND INNOVATIONS DESIGNING CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH OR EVEN BECOMING A NOBEL LAUREATE. WE OFFER THE TRANSFORMATIVE SERVICES PROGRAMS AND EXPERTISE TO MAKE THESE THINGS HAPPEN. LIBRARIANS NOW MORE THAN EVER ARE LOOKING BEYOND THEIR TRADITIONAL ROLES AND PROVIDING GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION EXPLORATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP. EMPOWERMENT AND ENGAGEMENT. THEREFORE I HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CRUCIAL ROLE. THAT LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS PLAY IN ADVANCING IDEALS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE HEARTS OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. I HOPE THAT IN YOUR REVIEW OF THE MASTER PLAN YOU ENSURE THAT LIBRARIES REMAIN AN ESSENTIAL AND WELL SUPPORTED COMPONENT OF CALIFORNIANS INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THANK YOU. NICK SIMEONE JONATHAN HUGHES FOLLOWED BY CATHERINE CALLED. THEY DO SO MUCH I CHAIR BERMAN AND SELENA MEDINA AYE JONATHAN HUGHES REPRESENTING AZUSA PACIFIC UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE MANY INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. WERE PROUD. THAT WE'VE BEEN PART OF THE MASTER PLAN SINCE IT'S. FORMATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY ARE PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL CHOICE FOR STUDENTS FOR WHOM AN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL MAY BE THE BEST CHOICE FOR THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. AND IF YOU HAS EIGHT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOCATIONS IN OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL I CAN SAY HONESTLY AFTER THE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE WITH MANY OF OUR PUBLIC PARTNERS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. A PARTICULARLY THE CCC ARE WE HAVE TO JUST COLLEGE PREPARATORY WORK CLOSELY WITH PASADENA CITY COLLEGE MOUNTS AND ANTONIO COLLEGE VICTOR VALLEY COLLEGE UP IN THE HIGH DESERT. AND MANY OTHER SO THAT'S JUST TO NAME A FEW I THINK A THEME DEFINITELY TODAY DURING OUR CONVERSATION HAS BEEN THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALPERS HIGHER ED LANDSCAPE. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT. AT IF YOU THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TO LOCAL GUARANTEED ADMISSION PARTNERSHIPS AND AP YOU JUST IN THE LAST YEAR TO WE'VE SIGNED FIFTEEN PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL QUE TWELVE DISTRICTS. AND WERE MORE REFLECTIVE THAN EVER OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THE BROADER CITY CALIFORNIA. AND JUST TO MENTION A FEW OF THE MANY PROGRAMS WE HAVE FOR FACULTY STAFF. WHEN IT COMES TO ENGAGING THE STUDENTS FROM ALL THESE DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND WE HAVE JUST IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAD TRAINING FOR STAFF AND FACULTY AROUND. ENGAGING WITH UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION PROGRAMMING PRADA SAY THAT OUR FRESHMAN CLASS THIS YEAR AT FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF THEM ARE THE FIRST IN HER FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. WHERE DIVERSITY AMBASSADOR PROGRAM THE TRAINING THAT'S HELD ALL YEAR ROUND FOR FACULTY AND STAFF ON ENGAGING THE STUDENTS? AND FACULTY FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS COME FROM AT THAT MINORITY BACKGROUNDS AS WELL AS LGBTQ TRAININGS AND VETERAN AND MILITARY CONNECTED FAMILIES HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT IDENTIFY THAT WAY. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST RESTAURANTS BASED CAMPUS AND SO WE ARE EMPLOYER STREETS WHICH APPROACH NOT ONLY WITH OUR FACULTY AND STAFF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT BEEN EMPOWERS THEM TO INTERACT WITH STUDENTS AND A LEAN TO THEIR STRENGTHS. RIGHT HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION. ONE OF ONLY THREE A PRIVATE CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY THAT HAVE THAT DESIGNATION YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ANYWAY I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THOSE FEW PROGRAMS WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR AND ADVOCACY FOR THE HIGHER ED. MASTER PLAN FOR SHOULD BE DRAWING.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CATHERINE COBB PRESIDENT OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL TWENTY TEN OR WE HAVE FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEMBERS. WHO DO WITH HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL AS SKILLED TRADE? I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CS YOU WHEN YOU SEE SHOULD BE A SOURCE OF GOOD JOBS. AND GOOD EDUCATION FOR CALIFORNIA AND THIS SHOULD BE CENTRAL PA Y. MASTER PLAN. OF KEY IMPORTANCE TO WORKERS HEALTH AND SAFETY IS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. CSU AND YOU SEE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO BILLION AS WELL AS EIGHT BILLION RESPECTIVELY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS FOLLOWING YEARS OF UNDERFUNDING ARE SKILLED TRADE MEMBERS AT CS YOU AND YOU SEE. OUR TASK WOULD MAINTAINING FACILITIES SO THEY KNOW BETTER. THAN ANYONE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK THAT THESE GOING BACK OAK LOGS POSE TO THEMSELVES STUDENTS AND FACULTY. YOU KNOW GOVERNOR BROWN PROPOSE I READ. HE PROPOSED AND ALSO REJECTED FIFTY MILLION FOR CS YOU AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR YOU SEE AN A ONE TIME FUNDING TO ADDRESS THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOGS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME GOVERNOR BROWN DID PROPOSE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO ADDRESS THE FAR MAINTENANCE I CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY COLLEGES I KNOW ADDRESSING CRITICAL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE NEEDS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR ALL. FOR ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION AND NOT JUST HUMIDITY COLLEGES. BUT GOVERNMENTS TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL CONTINUES A PATTERN OF UNDERFUNDING THAT NEEDS TO LARGER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOGS AND TOO FEW STAFF TO ADDRESS THE MAINTENANCE NEEDS. TOGETHER THESE ISSUES CAN CONTINUE. TO OUT SOURCE WHICH IS THE PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN PROJECTS BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE OR DANGEROUS. TO PUT ALL. WE HAVE SAID HAVE SEEN THAT OUTSOURCING UNDERMINES GOOD JOBS BY BRINGING IN CONTRACTORS WHO PAY THEIR WORKERS LITTLE WAGES AND PROVIDE FEWER BENEFITS AND IN SUMMARY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS MUST EIGHT INITIATIVE. TO ENSURE THAT THE C. S. YOU AND YOU SEE ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED TO MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE MASTER PLAN WHILE INCREASING ACCOUNTABILITY. OF THIS UC'S TO BE A SOURCE OF GOOD JOBS. AND EDUCATION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH CLASSROOM. BOTH WILL CONTROL OF ALL OF BY INTO ALONZO.

BUT ALSO ACHIEVE HIGHER EDUCATION. WHEN THAT HAS PROVEN TO CREATE STRONG PREPARED ACADEMICALLY SUSPECT SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS ARE DATA PROVES OUR PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. WHAT WE NEED A SIMPLE? WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOME WOULD SAY SHOW ME THE MONEY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE LESS THAN THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROGRAM FUNDING AND WITH THESE LIMITED FUNDS WE START OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHEN THAT DOES WHAT SOME WOULD CALL TRUE MIRACLES WITH OUR LIMITED RESOURCES. WE KNOW WE CAN AND ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE WITH ADEQUATE FUNDING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAY IS JUST A MINUTE I REQUEST FOR SIX MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO OUR BUDGET. WE HOPE YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS REQUEST THERE IS NO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL SUPPORT WENT THAT HAS A PROVEN THIRTY FIVE YEAR HISTORY OF SORT OF STUDENT SUCCESS. OUR WORK SUPPORTS THE MASTER PLAN BY CREATING EDUCATIONAL EQUITY FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS THAT MAIN AB NOT OTHERWISE PURSUE OR A CHIEF HIGHER EDUCATION. THERE FOR MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION AVAILABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS AND NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE BORN INTO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PRIVILEGE WE BRIDGE OUR STUDENTS AND FROM. WOODBRIDGE OUR STUDENTS INTO BECOMING FUTURE SUCCESSFUL COLLEGE GRADUATES AND PROFESSIONALS FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU ALSO ENOUGH.

I'M HERE WITH YOUR SAY COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS WELL AS THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY YOUNG DEMOCRATS. BOTH OF WHICH SUPPORTED THE FORTY DOLLAR FIX NOW NOTICED SIXTY SIX DOLLAR FIX WHICH WOULD RETURN OF HISTORIC FUNDING TO THE YOU SEE SEE SEE YOU AND YOU SEE SEE SISTER A CCC SYSTEM. UP AS WELL AS DECREASE PRIVATIZATION WHICH WOULD. ALLOW STUDENTS AND FACULTY TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL I'M A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF I'M ACTUALLY CURRENTLY A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT AT NOTS INNOCENT SO COMMITTEE CALLED TRADE DOWN THE LENGTH. AND I'M. I HAVE TO SAY THE. YOU KNOW LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME AYE AYE AYE AYE THEN TELL FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE ONCE YOU CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND HIGH SCHOOL I. SH I SHOULD HAVE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS IT WAS WATER TO HOW HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS AWAY FROM. NOT GRADUATING I'M IN TELFORD COMMITTEE COLLEGES HAVE GIVEN ME A SECOND CHANCE FOR MAGIC. SO I'VE GONE THERE AND. SUCCEEDED BUT IT WASN'T JUST BECAUSE OF MY QUOTE UNQUOTE HARD WORK. COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE AN ECOSYSTEM WHEN WE REALLY THINK ABOUT IT IT'S THE CUSTODIAN TO THE FACULTY TO STUDENT TO YOU KNOW THE LIBRARY. OF AND REALLY THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS NEED THESE RESOURCE THIS IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED BECAUSE I I CAN'T SAY THAT RIGHT NOW I I'M. I'M ACTUALLY GRADUATING THIS SEMESTER AND IT'S BEEN A LONG TWO YEARS. WHAT WHAT HE MEANS THE SYSTEM NO I I WAS PLACE IN REMEDIAL MATH REMEDIAL ENGLISH? I CAME IN THAT I HAD TO TAKE MATH FIFTY FIVE NINETEEN NINETY SIX ONE FLORIDA UNITED ALL THROUGH ALL THAT AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE THE NEAREST DEATH IN TIMES OF NEED THINKING OF DROPPING OUT JUST SAYING YOU KNOW IT LOOKS. A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO DO THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER PATHWAYS AND LIKE TO TAKE. I'M BUT IT WAS THE PROFESSORS THAT CAN BE AND IT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE OFFICE HOURS THAT I WAS ABLE TO. NOT ONLY TALK TO THEM ABOUT MY EDUCATION BUT MY PERSONAL THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON WITH IN MY LIFE. SO IT WAS REALLY PROFESSORS THAT ENABLED ME TO DO THIS AND SO BY DENYING FACULTY AND STUDENTS RESOURCES WE'RE NOT ONLY DENYING THAT YOU KNOW OURSELVES FROM. GREATER HEIGHTS BUT WE'RE DENYING OUR STATE AND OVERALL OUR COUNTRY FROM REACHING A BETTER. GENERATION WE WOULD BE DOING A LOT OF TO WHERE WE COULD IT POWER GENERATIONS FOR MUCH MUCH LARGER THAN JUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN COULD GO ON FOR YEARS SO WE NEED A VISION AND A PATHWAY TOWARDS THE FUTURE TO EMPOWER THE REST OF CALIFORNIANS. NOT JUST NOW BUT FOR. WANT YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU TRAVIS. NICK SIMEONE CHRISTIAN HE'S DONE FOLLOWED BY JAN MUCHO. THANKS OF I'M A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY HERE UC RIVERSIDE AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE RIVERSIDE FACULTY ASSOCIATION I WAS FINANCED BY THE. COUNCIL OF UNIVERSITY OF FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS OF THE UC SYSTEM TO COME AND BASICALLY ENDORSED THE AND TELL YOU ABOUT THIS. SIXTY SIX PICKS. DOT ORG PROPOSAL THAT TRAVIS JUST MENTIONED AND SOME OF YOU HAVE THAT IN YOUR AND YOUR THINGS BUT OTHER WHAT OTHERS WANT TO LOOK AT BASICALLY IT'S A PROPOSAL FOR HOW THE STATE CAN FIND. FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA AND ROLL BACK. WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. AND THEY THEY THEY'RE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE WAYS TO FUND THIS. INCOME TAX THE STATE TAX AND SO ON THAT BASICALLY THE IDEA HERE IS. THERE'S A THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN CALIFORNIA TO. HAVE A NEW NEW DEAL AND A NEW MASTER PLAN AND TO. GET PEOPLE IN THE THE THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT THAT. IT MAY TAKE A REFERENDUM BUT WE THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND SO WE SUPPORT ALL THE EFFORTS THAT ARE SELLING HUNDRED MAKING IN THAT. IN THE US IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW BUT WE THINK THERE'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY IN SAY CALIFORNIA TO DO PUBLIC EDUCATION RIGHT TO KEEP THIS PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH IS THE BEST ONE IN THE WORLD. AS GOOD AS IT HAS BEEN AND MAKE IT WORK FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU PROFESSOR MOST RELIGION AND. MUTO AND I APOLOGIZE BY GOD THAT NO YOU WERE PERFECT FOR WRITTEN FOR OF ALL BY JONATHAN ABBOUD. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN AND MR MEDINA FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. MY NAME IS JAN YOU TOM UP FOR AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT NORCO COLLEGE. BUT I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ASSOCIATION. WHICH IS THE HIGHER A BRANCH OF CTA ANY. I SIT ON THE BOARD AS A DIRECTOR OF DISTRICT QUE. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY RIVERSIDE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT. BUT I I REALLY WANT TO SPEAK IN PRETTY BROAD TERMS ABOUT. MY OWN PERSPECTIVE BEING A FORMER ADMINISTRATOR AS WELL AS. A COMMUTER COLLEGE PROFESSOR. I THINK THE COMMENTS OF THE PANELISTS WERE SO RELEVANT. A BUT I WANT. KIND OF PERSON INTO THREE. AREAS ONE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL A PIPELINE OF DISCRIMINATION. AND THAT REALLY IS THAT NOTION OF CHICKEN AND EGG. BUT IT IT IS FUELLED BY IN MY OPINION AN ACADEMIC ELITISM. WHERE WE DO IN FACT IN THE PROFESSION OF HIGHER ED? SEEK PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE OURSELVES AND AND THAT IS WHITE WHITE MEN WHO HAVE DOMINATED HIGHER EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY. AND I'LL Ó POINT THIS OUT BY AN EXAMPLE OF VERY REAL EXAMPLE THE PERSON THAT I KNOW VERY WELL THAT MR MEDINA KNOWS VERY WELL. WHO'S TAUGHT ADDICT A COLLEGE PART TIME FOR FOURTEEN YEARS THIS WOMAN HAPPENS TO BE LATINA. SHE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND SHE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE. SHE WAS A MEMBER OF A CANDIDATE IN A IN A POOL FOR A FULL TIME JOB AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND WAS CHOSEN. BUT THE CHOSEN CANDIDATE WAS A WHITE MALE COULD ONLY BEEN TEACHING FOR FIVE YEARS. WHO HAD A PHD IN HAND? AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE PHD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE. A GREAT COMMITTEE BECAUSE TEACHER EVEN THOUGH I AM ONE. YEAH IT EXCEPTIONS SUCH AN ACCORD. ANOTHER ANOTHER THING I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BEAR IN MIND AS YOU WORK ON THE MASTER PLAN IS A GROUP THAT I HAD NOT HEARD MENTION TODAY. THAT OFTEN SOUNDS IS SILENT AND THAT IS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF RACE WE'VE HEARD SOME ABOUT DIVERSITY AND SOCIO ECONOMIC CLASS. BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE PERSON TODAY. TALK ABOUT THE LGBTQ POPULATION. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IDENTIFIED AS A MEMBER OF THAT POPULATION SO THAT IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT. TO WHO WE ARE. AND IT ERIC AT MY COLLEGE ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WAS HELP CONVINCE OUR ADMINISTRATION TO ESTABLISH A SAFE ZONE. BUT WE PARTNERED WITH THE DOCTOR STUDENTS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH POPULATIONS FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY. SO WE THE STUDENTS CAUGHT THE UNITY SO. IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO BE ABLE TO FOR EVERY COLLEGE IN THE STATE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SUCH A A SPACE THERE ARE CURRENTLY ONLY SEVEN LGBT PRIDE CENTERS IN THE STATE. AT THE COMMUTER COLLEGES. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER THE CORPORATE IS ASIAN OF EDUCATION. AND THAT COMES NOT JUST IN THE FORM OF THE CORPORATIONS THAT SPONSOR GRANTS BUT IT REALLY COMES FROM OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BEING UNDER FUNDED. AND HAVING TO CHASE DOLLARS SO WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE PARTNERING. IN VERY KIND OF HAPHAZARD WAYS SOMETIMES WITH GRANT BODIES BUT ALSO WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY. SEEK FUNDS SO A FULL AND SHORT A FULLY FUNDED. THREE TIER SYSTEM. OF HIGHER EDUCATION HELPS US AND IT HELPS ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS HOMELESS STUDENTS AND LGBTQ TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU JAN. NEXT TO JONATHAN THE BOOT FALL BY FRED CINCHES. HELLO MY NAME IS JONATHAN THE MOOD I AM IN THE MASTER PLAN IS MY FAVORITE PIECE OF PUBLIC POLICY SINCE I WAS EIGHTEEN.

IN MY FIRST MONTH AT UCSB THOSE APPROACHES FOR ANOTHER TUITION INCREASE. AND THAT END UP CAUSING ME TO WRITE MY FIRST PEOPLE IN SCHOOL. ON THE MASTER PLAN. I FOUGHT TO PASS PROP THIRTY BECAUSE IT MEANT MY FELLOW STUDENTS WOULD HAVE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE OF ANOTHER TUITION INCREASE THAT WAS HELD A GUN TO OUR HEAD IF WE CAN PASS IT. AND THEN AT THE END OF MY TIME TO YOU SEE S. B. I WORKED ON A STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN TO GET STUDENT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. A NEW MASTER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA. REGARDLESS OF ALL THIS WHATEVER WE DECIDE WHAT'S IN THIS NEW MASTER PLAN THERE'S ONE CONSTANT AND ONE CLEAR ACTION THE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN. AND THAT'S FULLY FUNDING THE MASTER PLAN. THE MASTER PLAN AS WE KNOW IT IS THE BROKEN COVENANT TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THE STATE OBJECTED ON ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO FUND IT. STUDENTS OF COLOR LAUGHED THE UC SYSTEM NOT BECAUSE THE UC SYSTEM DIDN'T WANT THE BECAUSE THE STATE DEFUNDED THE SCHOOL'S TUITION AS A POLICY. IS AGAINST USE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO LISTEN CANNOT EXIST ANYMORE AND THE STATE. IF WE WANT A MASTER PLAN TO SUCCEED WE NEED TO FULLY FUNDED. AND PROJECTS AND IDEAS LIKE THE SIX SIX DOLLAR FIX TO HAVE FIVE COPIES OF RIGHT NOW OR REAL TANGIBLE PATH FORWARD SUPPORTED BY STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY STATE INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IF WE WANT TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM THIS TUITION FREE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND FOR ALL IN WE NEED TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTHS ARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JOHN. NEXT INFERENCE ENGINES FOLLOWED BY AMELIA MARTINEZ. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU. CHAIR BERMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I'M FRED SANCHEZ THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AT CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. AND AT THE CAMPAIGN WE WORK TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND AND SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. THIS SPRING THE CAMPAIGN PUBLISHED A REPORT TITLED LEFT OUT THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT TODAY AND WHICH FOUND THAT WHILE SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS COME FROM DIVERSE. RACIAL AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE FOR THE DIVERSITY OF ITS LEADERSHIP. OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF COLLEGE FACULTY IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP AT THE UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE WHITE. SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE MEMBERS ARE WHITE ACROSS THIS. AND. DESPITE FIFTY PERCENT OF. COLLEGE STUDENTS BEEN FEMALE WOMEN ARE UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG TENURED FACULTY ACADEMIC SENATE'S COLLEGE LEADERSHIP AND STATEWIDE GOVERNANCE. COLLEGE LEADERS SET THE TONE VALUES AND DIRECTION OF THEIR INSTITUTIONS. AND WHEN THEY'RE LEADERSHIP IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE STUDENT POPULATION. STUDENT SUCCESS SUFFERS. WHEN CAMPUSES ARE INCLUSIVE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE STUDENT POPULATION. CULTURE PRACTICES AND POLICIES ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS. THEY EXPERIENCE A GREATER SENSE OF BELONGING AND HAVE MORE ROLE MODELS WHO UNDERSTAND AND VALIDATE THEIR EXPERIENCES. OUR STATE AND COLLEGE LEADERS MUST GO BEYOND AN INTELLECTUAL COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY. THAT FOR TOO LONG HAS TOLERATED. TOLERATED ITS ABSENCE. THAT'S WHY TODAY WE URGE THE LEGISLATOR LOOKED LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR TO APPOINT UC REGENTS. CSU TRUSTEES AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEMBERS THAT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. THESE POSITIONS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO SETTING THE TONE AND DIRECTION OF THE INSTITUTIONS THEY SERVE. WE ALSO URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUIRE THE UC CSU. IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SUBMIT A BI ANNUAL ANALYSIS OF LEADERSHIP FACULTY AND ACADEMIC SENATE DIVERSITY. THIS AGGREGATED BY RACE ETHNICITY AND GENDER. THIS INCLUDES DEFINED GOALS FOR IMPROVEMENT. AND IT IS ONLY BY LOOKING AT THE DATA AND SETTING GOALS THAT OUR VERBAL COMMITMENTS TO DIVERSITY ARE MANIFEST. THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ENSURE OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE THE LEADERSHIP NEEDED TO SERVE OUR DIVERSE STUDENT BODY. THANK YOU FRED. NEXT UP WE HAVE A MILLION MARTINEZ IN AMELIA'S ONE OF OF HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS. THAT COME HAVE BEEN OF THE CAPITAL COUPLE A TIMES NOW. TO ADVOCATE SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN A MEAL. FIFTY SEE YOU TO. SO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MANY AT AYE AND THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR STUDENTS HERE UNDER A AS YOU SEE I. AM AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO SENT IN THE PANELS AND SPOKE BECAUSE I ALSO LEARNED A LIFE LIKE. SOMETIMES A STUDENTS WE DON'T ALWAYS FOCUS ON FACULTY AND STAFF WHICH WE SHOULD MORE IN OUT OF MY WAY TO A PORT OF. PORT OF THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS GRAY AT A I LEARNED A LOT. OF MOVING FORWARD AND DISPENSE AND MANY TIMES PERSISTED AND I WANT TO. REMIND EVERYONE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FORM A DIVERSE FACULTY AND STAFF FOR ALL THE REASONS THEY HAVE HEARD HERE TODAY. ON ANOTHER TOPIC. THE UC SYSTEM NEEDS TO STOP TRYING TO FIND SHORTCUTS WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. FOR EXAMPLE DID YOU KNOW THAT AND IT'S A CAMPUS THERE'S ENTRY LEVEL MATH CLASSES THAT ARE TAUGHT BY SECOND YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. NATIONAL BE HAPPENING Y. WISE TO SECOND YEAR TEACHING A FIRST YEAR ENTRY LEVEL MATH CLASS. ON OUR OUR LECTURES TAUGHT BY PROFESSOR BAR LOT WHICH FOR ENTRY LEVEL CLASSES ARE SOMETIMES UP TO THREE TIMES A WEEK. IS TAUGHT BY STE A SECOND YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS THE SOMETIMES WE SPEAK TO THEM THEY'VE ONLY TAKEN THREE MORE CLASSES OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS IN THE VERY STUDENTS ARE TEACHING. ON. I APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE STUDENT THAT DOES TEACH THESE CLASSES BECAUSE THEY WORK ICED TEA EIGHTIES AND YOU SHOULD BE THE CENTRAL ENTRY LEVEL CLASSES ARE BIG SO DARED TO YOU KNOW OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING A LOT OF PEOPLE. ON MOST OF THEM ARE MATH MAJORS IN A LOT OF THEM ARE YOU SEE VERY HAPPY BECAUSE OF THE WORKING FOR THAT BUT YOU SEE AND GETTING PAID FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND. AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE THEM THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES OF THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO BE TEACHING OTHER STUDENTS. ON A WIDE IS THE UC SYSTEM DO THIS BECAUSE THEY CAN PAY A STUDENT HAS. BEEN THEY SHOULD BE TRAINING DAY THAN THEY SHOULD BE PAYING TRAIN SOME OF THAT'S TRAINING HAS A REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS. M.. YOU KNOW THAT. A LITTLE SAD M. AND I THINK. STUDENTS WHO SERVE MORE THAN THAT THERE'S SO MANY STUDENTS HERE AND FAMILIES WHO DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO BE A YOU SEE ARE. AND THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT GIVING US THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION WE DO SERVE IS. DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO BETTER THAN THAT. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A LAB CAN REALLY IMPACT YOUR LEARNING AS ANYONE KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE IN A LAB WHERE NO DISCUSSION THAT'S WHY YOU DO MOST OF THE ACTUAL WORK WHEN. YOU'RE IN A SMALLER GROUP AND YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS RATHER THAN YOU DO IN A LECTURE SO. IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY EMPLOYMENT AND IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE. HOME SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING ON IT UP TO BRING UP TO NORTH ATTENTION. BEFORE I LEAVE I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE NEEDS NEEDS MORE FUNDING. ON EVERY TIME I GO AND I SEE ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE WORKING AND AND THEY'RE GREAT THEY WILL TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS TO THE BEST OF THE BILLY I BEEN THERE MULTIPLE TIMES HAVE BEEN THERE WITH OTHER STUDENTS HAVE BEEN THERE WITH MY PARENTS. DICK DO TRY THEIR BEST. Y. PERSON CANNOT HAVE HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE I'M. DOT ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT BE THE CASE IF NOT JUST BE ABOUT FIVE TO SIX PEOPLE WORKING ON WE NEED MORE PEOPLE AT THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE BECAUSE TRUST ME STUDENT TOUGH QUESTIONS. I'M WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A SYSTEM EVERY SINGLE YOU SEE CAL STATE INCOMMUNICADO LEGIT WHERE STUDENTS CAN MAKE APPOINTMENTS WHERE YOU GO TO A CLOSED OFFICE. I'M I'M NOT I CANNOT SPEAK FOR EVERY SINGLE YOU SEE BUT MOST UC'S I'VE BEEN TO ON THE WAY IT'S SET UP YOU STAND IN A LINE THERE'S OVER ON THE FRONT AND. USUALLY IT'S KIND OF QUIET EVERY ONCE IN THE PHONE. AND YOU CAN HEAR. WAS ON THE FINANCIALLY DEVICES ARE TELLING THOSE STUDENTS I HAVE HER MULTIPLE TIMES WE NEED TO PICK SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS YOU WANNA BE WITH HIM ALL. THIS IS VERY PERSONAL STUFF THAT'S BEING TOLD IN A ROOM FULL OF OTHER PEOPLE ON BUSES ON THE SEA CHANGE EVERY TIME I TALK TO STUDENT THAT. DESERVES TO CONTINUE TO BE A MOLD AND AND THIS YOU SEE IN THIS YOU SEE. I HEAR THEM SAY. WHY DON'T I GOT QUESTION BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE LISTENING? YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL THIS JUST KIND OF STICK MUSLIM TIMES AROUND HAVE BEING ABLE TO AFFORD AN EDUCATION SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT CHANGING ITS LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT. LITTLE CONSIDERATIONS LIKE THAT THAT WE. CHANGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE AT HERE A YOU SEE I. ON LASTLY STUDENTS WE WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR FOR FACULTY FOR STUFF WE ARE COMMUNITY WE SEE. EACH OTHER EVERY SINGLE DAY I CAN TELL YOU PAT T. H. WHO ARE MAY SEEM TO MEAN HE'LL WALK ON SINGLE SOURCE STOPPING FACULTY. SO WE WE SHOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR EACH OTHER ONE SHOULD BE THERE. LISTENING TO TURN IN HEARING EACH OTHER OUT SO WE SHOULD HAVE MORE EVENTS LIKE THIS THINK YOU THANK YOUR MILLION. NEXT UP WE HAVE ALL HUNTER LOW MILLIE WHO PARTICIPATED IN OUR STUDENT HEARING AT FRESNO CITY COLLEGE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN I WANDER IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING. YEAH ZILLOW EVERYONE. THINK IT'S IS THAT WE MEMBER BERMAN SILLIER MEDINA AND OTHER MEMBERS THE SELECT COMMITTEE MEETINGS ALL HUNTER LAMELLAE I MISS YOU TO AND LONG YOU SEE COLLEGE WITH PLANS TO TRANSFER TO COUNTY LONG BEACH IN THE FALL. SO I I'VE DONE SOME WORK ACROSS THE STATE ON SOME ISSUES AND. I KNOW WE ALL HAVE SOME INITIATIVES THAT WE WANT TO PUSH FORWARD THEY LIKE TO KEEP MY COMMENTS THE FOCUS MORE ON FACULTY AND STAFF. IT MORE. I'M ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE SEEN HER SINGING I JUST CANNOT GET MY MIND OVER. IS THIS ISSUE THAT WE SEE A STUDENT ERA WE TALK TO STUDENT THAT THERE THAT THEY HAVE TO ATTEND THREE COMMUTER COLLEGES ARE MORE COMEY COLLEGES TO REACH YOUR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY. WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A PROBLEM WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU DO A BIT MORE WE NEED TO ALIGN OUR COURSE SCHEDULING WE NEED TO OFFER MORE CLASSES WE NEED TO OFFER. MORE ADAPTABLE SECTIONS FOR THE STUDENT TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN WE HAVE THE SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH FACULTY AND STAFF THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK AT THREE DIFFERENT COMMUNICABLE EDGES TO BE SUCCESSFUL OR TO SURVIVE. IT'S JUST ANOTHER NOR. YOU KNOW I HAVE A PROFESSOR RIGHT NOW YOU SEE WHO HAS TO TEACH AT THREE DIFFERENT CAN YOU COLLEGES. AND I ASKED HER YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU TEACHING AT THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SHE SAYS I BECAUSE I WANT TO ITS BECAUSE I HAVE TO. SO I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND I I KEEP HEARING IN THESE MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE ALL HERE FOR STUDENTS AND. YOU KNOW I KEEP HEARING OVER OVER AGAIN I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BELIEVE IT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW STUDENTS CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE SYSTEM IS NOT THERE TO MEET THEM BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM. PERSONALLY IT IS HEARTENING TO ME TO SEE MY FAIR PROFESSORS THAT INSPIRED ME TO DO MORE AND BE BETTER. STRUGGLING WITH THEMSELVES TO SUPPORT THEM THEIR OWN SUCCESSES AND THEIR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW I'M SORRY TODAY I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS FOR YOU ALL ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE SUGGESTIONS ARE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE BUT I HOPE THESE OPEN UP SOME CONVERSATIONS AND OPEN UP A DIALOGUE THAT WE CAN HAVE MOVING FORWARD. TO INCLUDE THOSE MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE BECAUSE WE WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE MUST DO BETTER FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FACULTY AND STAFF THAT WE. SUPPORT AND DAILY BASIS I DO WANNA ENDS UP WITH A COUPLE PLUGS THE FIRST ONE. IS THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THIS IDEA OF YOU KNOW HAVING A STUDENT'S EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY MAPPED OUT FROM INSTITUTION TO INSTITUTION. AND AS A TRANSFER STUDENT RIGHT NOW GOING TO THE TRANSFER PROCESS I CAN EVEN APPLY TO CLASSES UNTIL THE MONTH BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. I'M SO I GET ALL THE LEFTOVER CLASSES I'M GONNA REALLY BE FIGHTING FOR THE AND THAT'S A KEY PIECE THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON AS WELL AND FACULTY WILL BE A HUGE PART IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE EARLIER ABOUT I'M STRENGTHENING AND IMPROVING THE CULTURE AROUND SHARED GOVERNANCE AND AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE EARLY ABOUT INCLUDING FACULTY STAFF ADMINISTRATORS AND ALL THOSE CONVERSATIONS. I DO WANT US TO REMEMBER THAT STUDENTS ARE VALUED PARTNER WE WANT ENCOURAGED THAT PARTICIPATION AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOUR HONOR. NEXT WE HAVE NATALIE MORALES FOLLOWED BY ALONDRA LUNA. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS NATALIE MORALES I AM A STUDENT AT UC RIVERSIDE AND I AM PART OF THE US IN GOVERNMENT AS A CIVIC ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE DIRECTOR. AND OF FOR SO WHY DOESN'T APOLOGIZE FOR MY TERRY TO PEEN THINKING BACK FROM A MID TERM REALLY TIRED. BUT ANYWAYS. I JUST WANTED TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PANELISTS THAT EVERYONE THAT'S HERE BECAUSE OF THAT I LEARNED A LOT LIKE. EMELIA THAT. FROM EVERYONE'S. RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCES BUT I DO WANNA POINT OUT A FEW. ON TOPICS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. ONE IS. ABOUT MAKING A FACULTY OF MORE DIVERSE IN THAT RACE ETHNICITY AS OF EACH YEAR AND THE OF RELIGION AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE. AS A STUDENT I NEED THAT RAMALLO. TO TEACH ME OF CLASSES YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THOSE CLASSES THAT WE LEARN ABOUT THESE ISSUES WE SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE FROM THAT COMMUNITY TEACHING THIS. SO. THAT'S JUST AN EMPHASIS THAT I WANT A PET. AND ALSO I WANNA PUT AN EMPHASIS ON TEMPORARY. FACULTY I THINK. IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS FORA FACULTY TO BE WORRYING ABOUT WHERE THEY GONNA BE REHIRED WHEN I THINK THEY'RE GREAT PROFESSORS I WANNA. HERE BUTTON OR TAKE MORE CLASSES WITH THEM. AND ALSO THE RESTRICTIONS OR THE WORRY THEY HAVE. A LOT OF PROFESSORS WORRY ABOUT. ON. IN GIVING TOO MANY AIDS. THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM I SHOULDN'T BE WORRYING ABOUT ARM AND I GONNA MAKE THAT CATEGORY OF THE HAVING THE EIGHT IF I DESERVE THE A AS YOU GET THAT AID NOT JUST BECAUSE. FACULTY BELIEVE THAT A THE THEY WON'T GET REHIRED IF THEY GET THEY GET TOO MANY AIDS. THAT'S SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM. AND ALSO IF THERE'S SUCH A LARGE POOL THAT COULD BEAT ARM PERMANENT WORKERS HERE. WHY? NOT THAT IS THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS BECAUSE. THERE IS AND I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S. A STATE FOR OPPORTUNITY MOST OF THE OTHER FACULTY MEMBERS HERE ARE FROM OTHER STATES I'VE HAD MOST OF MY FOR PRESSURES FROM FROM OUR STATE. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE HIGHER AND OUR OWN CALIFORNIA WORKERS THAT ARE ALREADY ON TEMPORARY WORKERS HERE SO I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT. AND ALSO MORE FACULTY IN TERMS OF COUNSELORS. AND DESPITE YOU SEE ARE THERE. HOUSE FRIEDMAN FACULTY IS FOURTEEN. OUT OF THOSE FOURTEEN E. ARE LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST. FOR THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENT BODY. THAT'S. NOT HOURS BUT. IT'S VERY LIMITED TIME YOU CAN HAVE. A RESTRAINED TIME WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES I SHOULD BE MAKING ON THE POINT MEANT LIKE WEEKS AFTER LIKE I'M STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. TO JUST DISCUSS SOMETHING THAT BALL EVEN MATTER INTO THE TWO WEEKS. YOU KNOW SO I THINK MORE FACULTY. IS VERY IMPORTED SO FUNDING FOR THESE ISSUES IS. EXTREMELY IMPARTED TO STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF. AND YEAH THOSE ARE JUST THE SOME OF THE FEW POINTS I WANT TO MENTION AND THANK YOU FOR. TAKING THE TIME IN HEARING ME AND MAKING THIS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO SINCE LIKE MYSELF THINK YOU THINK YOU KNOW. NICK SIMEONE ALONDRA LUNA FOLLOWED BY KILEY SANCHES. HELLO EVERYBODY MY NAME IS A LONDON LUNA AND AMY SEE OUR STUDENTS ARE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BERMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AFTER LISTENING TO ALL OF US. AND CONTINUE TO HOLD THIS HEARING I ORIGINALLY WASN'T GOING TO BE SO TO BE SPEAKING I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH ALL OF YOU. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS A STUDENT OF MYSELF TO EMPHASIZE A MESSAGE THAT EVERYBODY'S NEEDS NEEDS NEEDS TO BE MET. THERE REGARDLESS OF DEMOGRAPHICS REGARDLESS OF AGE REGARDLESS OF GENDER REGARDLESS OF IDENTITY THE ONLY TO BE MET. PERSONALLY I KNOW MANY STUDENTS I GO TO THE RESOURCES ON CAMPUS AND ACTUALLY UTILIZE RESOURCES. AND THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE CONNECTING WITH STAFF BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE NOT YOU GO TO THESE COUNTERS AT THE CARE OFFICE. AND SEE THEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR WHATEVER YOU'RE STRUGGLING AT HOME. AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THEM BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME YOU GO YOU GONNA BE SWITCHED OUT BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A LOT OF. UNDERSTAFFED. AND ALSO. ANOTHER FACT IS. YOU ENROLL IN THESE CLASSES AND YOU'RE ALWAYS NERVOUS WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO BE PUT IN THESE CLASSES AND ONCE YOU ARE THERE THEIR STUDENTS SITTING ON THE FLOOR. AND THEIR STUDENTS IN THE BACK TO STANDING UP AND THERE SHOULD BE MORE SEATS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SCHOOL OF DESIGN HAS WORKED IN THE PAST YEARS AND USE YOUR IS A BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS. AND I KNOW EVERYONE WORKS HARD TO MAKE IT A BETTER CAMPUS EVERYDAY. BUT. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA STATED IN THE LAST. CONGRESO HAD LIKE WE COULD GO TODAY'S A RAINY DAY AND IT'S RAINING RIGHT NOW AND WE NEED TO BE FUNDED. AND WE NEED TO BE MET OUR RESIDENTS METS THE STAFF THE FACULTY EVERYONE ENDING IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT MESSAGE AND INFORM THE I HAVE UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE ENDORSED. A PLAN YET BECAUSE I WANT TO BE MORE WELL INFORMED AND EDUCATE MYSELF SINCE I AM THE FIRST YEAR I'M STILL LEARNING AND GAINING ALL THESE.
