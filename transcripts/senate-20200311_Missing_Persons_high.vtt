PROCESS. LOOK LIKE. BUT IT

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:23.928
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE SOME

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:26.631
ADDITIONAL IDEAS AS WELL THAT

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:27.198
ARE ARE WELL YOUR POINTS ARE

OFFICERS IN THE FIELD PROBABLY

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.211
EVER DOES COME FROM COMMAND WE

TAKE A LOOK AT THE INSTRUCTOR

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:55.293
DELIVERY. IN TERMS ARE THEY

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.495

RELEVANCY FOR CURRENCY I WE

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:12.177
MAKE A DAT ADAPT HAITIANS AS

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:13.778
NECESSARY AND TYPICALLY THE

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:14.946
ADAPTATIONS THAT WE MAKE A VERY

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.948
AGILE. AND SO WE WILL WE WILL

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:17.916
MAKE THOSE THAT WE CAN

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:19.817
ACTUALLY- WE CAN UPDATE

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:22.220
APPROVED- ACRYLAMIDE EDUCATION

00:30:22.287 --> 00:30:24.956
IN TERMS OF ADDING THINGS

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:25.957
WITHIN AN HOUR. GET THAT

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:27.759
INFORMATION OUT. YEAH WE HAVE A

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.360
REGIONAL CONSULTANTS THAT ARE

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:30.762
VERY GOOD TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING

00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:32.664
RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERY LAW

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.700
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. SO BOTH-

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:37.235
HAS A HIGHLY NETWORKED

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:39.604
RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL OF LAW

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.239
ENFORCEMENT. ON THE LOCAL.

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:44.475
STATE NATIONAL. AND EVEN

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:46.110
INTERNATIONAL BASIS- YOU YOU

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:47.812
PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT BUT-

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:49.614
POST FREQUENTLY WE ENTERTAIN

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.616
ENTERTAIN- DIGNITARIES FROM

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:52.784
OTHER NATIONS BECAUSE THEY

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.819
THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE FAR

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:57.355
EXCEEDS. OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:59.757
THEIR CURRICULUM. AND IT'S TRUE

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:02.126
AND IS TRUE IT'S TRUE AND SO

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:03.261
WE'RE VERY PROACTIVE IN THAT

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.897
AREA- I THINK THAT WE SHOULD

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:06.731
ALSO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT SOME

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:08.499
OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY

00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:09.701
USED WHEN GET VESTED GATE

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:11.336
MISSING PERSON I TALK ABOUT-

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:13.905
INTO A AS THE ICY. NAME IS A

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:16.341
CLASS- WHICH IMAGE YOU HAVE THE

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:17.108
INTERNET INFORMATION WITHIN

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:19.143
FOUR HOURS- I THINK WE SHOULD

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.511
TAKE MORE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:22.714
OF THE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.781
WE CAN ELIMINATE SOME OF THE

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:24.749
OLD SCHOOL THINGS LIKE DOOR

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:26.217
KNOCKING BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.785
VERY IMPORTANT ALSO BUT I THINK

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:28.686
WE HAVE TO INCREASE OUR

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.822
RELATIONSHIP WITH SURVEILLING

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:33.758
CERTAIN FOLKS- GPS TRACKING

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:35.293
DEVICES LISTENING DEVICES

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.596
HIDDEN MINIATURE CAMERAS A

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:41.633
COVERT BRADY BODY CALMEST ASH

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:44.168
CAN. MAYBE BUT BRIDGE A BRUSH

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:46.037
CAMERA. MILLET IMAGERY SURVEYS

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:49.173
TAKE. FLAT APT OPTICAL LIKE

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.075
DETECTION- KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:52.210
I MEAN TO IT THERE'S A FULL

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:54.245
SPECTRUM. OF THINGS THAT WE

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:55.713
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO IF WE

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.815
HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT. AND SO

00:31:57.882 --> 00:32:00.084
OUR OBJECTIVE IS ALWAYS ENSURE

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:01.252
THAT OUR INSTRUCTORS ARE NEVER

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:02.720
TEACHING FROM OF A SILO

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:04.756
PERSPECTIVE. WE ALWAYS WANTED

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:06.424
TO INTERACT. BECAUSE OF THAT

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:09.193
INFORMATION COMES. OUTSIDE YOU

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.461
MENTIONED THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:13.131
OF DEFENSE HAS TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:15.433
YOU BELIEVE COULD BE USED TO

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.669
INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:20.571
UNIDENTIFIED REMAINS. CAN YOU

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:22.206
SPEAK TO THAT AGAIN PLEASE YEAH

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:22.940
THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:24.042
EXAMPLE FOR YEARS THE

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:24.676
MILITARY'S ACTUALLY BEEN

00:32:24.742 --> 00:32:27.779
INSERTING- BIO INFORMATION

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:31.049
SHIPS IN SOLDIERS. IN THE EVENT

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.750
THAT THEY GET SEPARATED YOU

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:35.153
KNOW AND SO- AND THERE IS A LOT

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.788
NOW TO REALLY DRILL DOWN TO

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:38.389
FIND OUT THE NUANCES OF THEIR

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:39.390
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.858
DEVELOP A GREAT RELATIONSHIP

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.061
WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED- IS THAT

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:44.529
MANY OF OUR MILITARY ALL THE

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:46.564
FIVE BRANCHES NOW SIX WITH THE-

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.167
THE SPACE BRANCH- MANY OF OUR

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.635
BRANCHES OF THE FIVE BRANCHES

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.570
AT LEAST. THEY'RE VERY A

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.372
SECRETIVE ABOUT THEIR

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:56.107
TECHNOLOGY I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:57.608
BE MORE FOR PROACTIVE IN

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:58.242
DEVELOPING A SHARE

00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.744
RESPONSIBILITY WITH AND WE MUST

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:00.912
HAVE TO LOBBY AND LIKE MANY OF

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:02.580
YOUR CONSTITUENTS LOBBY YOU AS

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:03.715
A WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE THAT

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:05.416
KIND OF RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.385
TO GAIN ACCESS TO WITH A NO.

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:09.120
AND SO I THINK THAT ARE THERE'S

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:10.822
MUCH THAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE WE

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:13.791
HAVE INFORMATION WE JUST HAVE

00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:15.226
TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO IT.

00:33:15.293 --> 00:33:17.528
THANK YOU. NOW THE QUESTION.

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:20.865
THIS I'M SORRY IN THE QUESTIONS

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.433
ARE JUST MORE CURIOSITY I MEAN

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.835
I KNOW IT HAPPENS BUT IT CAN

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:25.737
YOU SHARE WHAT CRITERIA HAS TO

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:27.372
BE MET BEFORE LIKE A LOCAL

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:29.140
AGENCY TRANSFERS A CASE TO THE

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.943
FBI MATHIS HIM AT SOME POINT

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:33.811
THE POLICE HANDLES IT UNTIL

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.446
THEY CAN NO LONGER SO HOW DOES

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:37.281
A TRANSFER HAPPENED A CALL TO

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.616
THE FBI HOW DO THEY GET

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:39.884
INVOLVED I WOULD THINK THAT IF

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:40.351
THERE'S AN INTERSTATE

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:43.221
JURISDICTION HELLO THIS TO YOU

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:45.189
HAVE A- YOU HAVE A- I DON'T

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:47.692
HAVE FILE. LETTER FOLLOWS KNOWN

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:48.960
IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE

00:33:49.026 --> 00:33:49.894
YOU KNOW WHEN THE INFORMATION

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:50.828
GOES IN THE NAME IS WORTH THE

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:52.797
ICY WE ACTUALLY OF ABILITY NOW

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.265
TO HAVE A NETWORKED INFORMATION

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:55.466
SYSTEM WHERE WE COULD PICK UP

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.635
THAT INFORMATION FROM OTHERS

00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:00.338
SO. IF THE QUESTION IS WHEN

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:01.139
DOES THE CASE BECOME A COURT

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:04.242
CASE. AND SO. WE HAVE THE CASE

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:06.043
UP TO THE POINT THAT THERE ARE

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.645
NO NO FURTHER LEADS. NOW YOU

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.180
HAVE TO TALK TO EXPECTED AGENCY

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:12.083
TO DETERMINE WHAT OTHER RAT

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:12.583
WHAT ARE THE LOCAL. ARE

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:13.751
REQUIREMENTS PROCEDURES

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:15.253
POLICIES PROCEDURES REGARDING

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.021
WHEN THE CASE GOES COAL. HOW

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:18.823
LONG DO YOU ALLOW THAT TO BE IN

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.057
A POSITION IN TYPICALLY STAYS

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:21.859
THERE. UNTIL SOME ADDITIONAL

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.362
INFORMATION. A COMES IN WE HAD

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.798
THAT WITH OUR- WAS THAT THE

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:28.599
STRANGLER HERE. I IN IN

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.301
CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GETTING THIS

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:33.504
NAME. BUT OF. THE TRANSFER IS

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.673
NEVER REALLY TRANSFERRED TO

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.809
ANOTHER AGENCY. IT'S USUALLY A

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:40.478
SITUATION WE COLLABORATE WITH

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:41.379
ANOTHER AGENCY IF THERE IS A

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:43.915
HIT. AND SO THEY HAVE TO BE A

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.783
NEED ACT ACTUALLY OPEN A CO

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.286
CASE. SO WHAT'S CONSIDERED A

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:50.521
COLD CASE IN TERMS OF TIMELINE

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:51.856
HAS AND THAT'S THE THIS

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:53.825
QUESTION IS SO EACH DEPARTMENT

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:54.926
WOULD DETERMINE THAT PROCESS

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.894
AND HAVE A- DETERMINATION FOR

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.763
WHAT A CO CASES. YOU KNOW SO WE

00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.764
TOOK A LOOK AT THE HOUSE RIGHT

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:02.600
HILLSIDE STRANGLER CASE YOU

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:03.167
KNOW THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:03.801
DONE DECADES AGO ALMOST A

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.536
DECADE AGO BUT THE KEY IS THAT

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:06.304
IT TOOK SOME ADDITIONAL

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.105
INFORMATION SO THE KEY REMAIN

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:10.074
COOL SO HOW LONG IS. A CASE A

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:12.777
NOW PUT ON A BURKE ON ON SITE

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.245
ON THE SIDE BURNER. IT'S A

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:16.314
LOCAL DETERMINATION SENATE

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.782
FIRING SHARE I IT WAS UNDER THE

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:19.917
IMPRESSION THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.819
TO BE A COLD CASE MAYBE I'M I

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:23.254
MISUNDERSTOOD AT TIMES WERE THE

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.822
FBI COME SOONER TO TRY AND HELP

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.157
EXPEDITE LIKE FINDING A MISSING

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:28.693
CHILD OR AT NINE ASSIST WE HAVE

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:30.161
TO REQUEST THAT ALL YOU HAVE

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.196
AGENCY HAS TO TRIGGER THAT

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:34.165
REQUEST. AND THERE IS NO

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:36.267
STANDARDIZATION FOR WHEN YOU DO

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:39.270
THAT YOU KNOW AND SALAS JUST

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:39.904
COMES OUT TO A PERSON I'M IN A

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.772
RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW AND SO

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:44.408
THAT THERE THERE IS NO POST

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:45.977
MANDATE OR STANDARD. THAT

00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:47.011
REQUIRES YOU CONTACT AN OUTSIDE

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.546
AGENCY. OR HOMICIDE

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:49.780
INVESTIGATOR INVESTIGATORS OF

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:51.382
MISSING PERSONS- ARE ARE

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.584
TYPICALLY VERY FOCUS. THE RE

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.353
PASSION ABOUT RESOLVING EVERY

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:56.888
CASE. BUT AS I MENTIONED

WAS GETTING STOP IS BECAUSE THE

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:03.881

THE BEEN THERE. SO I WASN'T

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:13.257
THERE FOR THAT REASON I HAD TO

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:14.759
STAY WITH MY PARTNER AND I

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:17.094
COULD INVESTIGATE THAT. FIVE

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.696
YEARS LATER. I'M IN CHARGE OF

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:20.831
VICE- IN DOWNTOWN ONE OF MY

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:23.567
GUYS BRINGS. IN A YOUNG PERSON.

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:27.271
WITH A PROSTITUTE. TURNS OUT

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:30.274
THAT PERSON WAS ONE OF THE KIDS

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.009
WHO LIVE IN A HOTEL AND I

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:34.178
WANTED TO MYSELF IS THERE

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:34.745
SOMETHING THAT I COULD HAVE

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:37.648
DONE. FIVE YEARS EARLIER. THE

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.650
COULD PREVENT IT THAT OUTCOME A

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:41.485
BEEN A REST AS A PROSTITUTE

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.154
FIVE YEARS LATER. SO WHEN WE

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.291
LOOK INTO OUR SYSTEM- NEMETH

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.794
AND IS THE ICY IT CAME OF THAT

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.730
PERSON WAS A MISSING PERSON.

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:53.764
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THAT

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.533
HAPPENING. I THINK THE CHANCES

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:58.335
ARE GREAT. AS A WE TAKE A LOOK

00:38:58.402 --> 00:38:59.470
AT A LOT OF A LOT OF OUR HOMES

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:01.172
COMMUNITY. HOW MANY PERSONS ARE

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:03.974
ACTUALLY MISSING. PROBABLY A

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.276
LOT OF THEM THAT'S WHY I JUST

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:06.243
WANT TO PUT THAT IN THERE

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.012

IS NOT EMERGENT IS HERE NOW.

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.450
AND SO I THINK WHAT WE WHAT WE

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:12.983
HAVE TO DEAL WITH. IS THE

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.685

TO ASSUME THAT. THE DNA THEY

PERCENTAGE OF THE- OF THE TOTAL

OF THOSE WHO ARE STILL MISSING.

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.195
SOAP CREEK CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:56.731
THE SYSTEM WE'RE CLOSE TO

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:59.000
TWENTY THOUSAND SO IT'S

01:23:59.067 --> 01:23:59.634
NINETEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.102
AND FIFTY NINE. ACTIVE MISSING

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.303
PERSON RECORDS THAT WAS AS OF

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.372
MARCH FIRST. AND OUT OF THAT

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:06.775
NUMBER WE HAVE DENTAL RECORDS

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:09.210
ON FILE AT MAPS AND ALSO IN

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:12.614
NCIC. FOR ONE THOUSAND THREE

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.048
HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE OF THEM

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.150
SAID THAT'S LESS THAN TWO

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.519
PERCENT. 2% CAN YOU DESCRIBE

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:20.221
FOR US SOME OF THE REASONS WHY

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:22.190
THAT NUMBER WOULD BE SMALL AND

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.492
IF THAT. CHANGED OVER TIME OR

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:25.660
IF THAT'S BEEN A PRETTY

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.896
CONSISTENT PERCENTAGE OVER

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:30.165
TIME. I'M EIGHT IT'S GROWN A

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.566
LITTLE BIT OVER TIME JUST

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:33.401
BECAUSE OF PROVIDING TROUT

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:36.805
TRAINING AN OUT REACH. THERE'S

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.239
MANY REASONS WHY THAT NUMBER'S

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.408
PRETTY SMALL ONE OF WHICH WOULD

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:42.577
BE MANY CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ANY

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:45.647
DENTAL RECORDS AVAILABLE-

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:50.218
THERE'S ALSO CASES WHERE.

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:52.420
DENTAL RECORDS ARE NOT ACTUALLY

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.522
THERE THERE'S NO- GUIDELINES

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:55.957
FOR DENTAL OFFICES TO MAINTAIN

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.493
DENTAL RECORDS. AS A GENERAL

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.228
PRACTICE THE WILL KEEP THEM FOR

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:02.497
ABOUT SEVEN YEARS BUT IF A

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:04.265
PATIENT DOESN'T RETURN AFTER A

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.066
YEAR SOMETIMES THEY'RE

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:07.469
DESTROYED- WITH MANY LOCAL

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.704
PRACTICES. GOING OUT OF

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.573
BUSINESS BEING BOUGHT BY AND

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.775
BIG DENTAL CORPORATIONS THEIR

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.810
OLDER RECORDS ARE OFTENTIMES

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.446
DESTROYED AS WELL- SO IT'S

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:19.981
REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN SOMEBODY

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:21.649
IS REPORTED MISSING TO OBTAIN

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:22.951
THOSE DENTAL RECORDS IN A

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:24.719
REALLY TIMELY MANNER. SO THAT

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.621
THEY CAN BE COLLECTED AND

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:28.590
MAINTAINED IF THEY'RE SUBMITTED

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.825
TO US AT DOJ. WE MAINTAIN THEM

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:32.393
INDEFINITELY SO IT DOESN'T

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.995
MATTER IF THEY'RE OBTAIN ONE

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:36.831
TIME FOR SAY A RUN AWAY AND

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:39.067
THAT PARTICULAR CHILD COMES AND

01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:40.435
GOES IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:41.503
MANY TIMES WILL JUST KEEP

01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:43.171
UPDATING THE SYSTEM WITH THOSE

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:47.609
DENTAL RECORDS. AND THEN ALSO-

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:49.110
SOMETIMESFAMILY MEMBERS DON'T

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:51.412
KNOW WHERE THEIR LOVED ONES-

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:53.381
WENT TO THE DENTIST ESPECIALLY

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:55.049
IF PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM OTHER

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:57.352

MY MOM WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHO

MY DENTIST AS- HERE. A GOOD

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:11.933
EXAMPLE. IF A FAMILY MEMBER

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.935
WERE TO COME FORWARD AND I WILL

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.370
GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A YOUNG

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.771

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:40.995
QUICK OCCUR. TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:43.898
THAT THE DNA WOULD BE UPLOADED

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:46.067
INTO THE STATE SYSTEM AS WELL

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.403
AS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. A WELL

OBTAIN. THAT DNA SAMPLES SO

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:08.089
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME TO

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.058
CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THEIR

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:12.827
SAMPLES AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.562
TO GO TO THE- LOCAL LAW

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:16.130
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT HAS

LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:27.875
PROVIDE A SAMPLE- BUT OF COURSE

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.143
AT OUR BUREAU OF FORENSIC

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:33.448
SERVICES HANDLES ALL OF OUR DNA.

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:34.015
COLLECTION PROCEDURES AFTER

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:37.719
THAT POINT. IS THERE A CLEAR

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:39.687
WAY FOR FAMILY MEMBERS TO KNOW

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:42.123
WHETHER THERE IS DNA ON FILE

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.125
FOR THEIR LOVED ONE IS THAT

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:46.327
SOMETHING THAT'S INDICATED AND

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:49.464
RECORDS THAT ARE PUBLIC I NOTED

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.265
AT THE CALIFORNIA DOJ THERE'S

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:53.434
THE PUBLIC SYSTEM AND THEN

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.637
THERE'S THE SECOND SYSTEM THAT

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:57.372
IS USED STRICTLY BY LAW

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.474
ENFORCEMENT SO IS THERE A WAY

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.209
FOR A FAMILY MEMBER TO LOOK UP

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:03.878

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:06.381
ANY CERTAINTY WHETHER THERE IS

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:08.483
DNA ON FILE FOR THEIR LOVED ONE

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:09.817
WE WOULD ADVISE THEM TO SPEAK

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.185
WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:13.154
AGENCY THAT HAS JURISDICTION

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:13.988
OVER THAT PARTICULAR

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:16.591
INVESTIGATION OKAY AND THEN FOR

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:18.259
THAN THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:20.361
YOU GAVE THAT ARE STILL ACTIVE-

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:22.196
DO YOU HAVE IT I THINK YOU SAID

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.698
EARLIER THE NUMBER THAT YOU

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.333
BELIEVE ARE STILL MISSING AFTER

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.435
YEARS TIME. CAN YOU GIVE US

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.504
THAT NUMBER YES AFTER AFTER ONE

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.606
YEAR AS OF MARCH FIRST TWO

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:35.009
THOUSAND AND 201-100-0500 AND

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:37.011
TWENTY TWO CASES ARE STILL

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.580
ACTIVE IN THE SYSTEM. SO THAT

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:42.984
WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY HALF.

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:47.588
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OKAY.

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.190
AND SO JUST SO THAT I MAKE SURE

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:49.957
THAT I UNDERSTAND THIS

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:51.993
CORRECTLY WHEN LOCAL LAW

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.361
ENFORCEMENT RECEIVES A REPORT

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:54.896
OF A MISSING PERSON THEY

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:58.966
REPORTED TO. CALIFORNIA MOPS.

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:02.170
AND THE INFORMATION IS

01:29:02.236 --> 01:29:04.872
COLLECTED THROUGH CLASS CRACKED

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:06.007
AND TRANSFERRED INTO THE

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:08.743
STATE'S DATABASE AND

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.478
AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED INTO AND

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:14.248
SEE I SEE WHERE DOES IT REQUIRE.

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:16.384
DOES IT IS IT REQUIRED THAT.

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.186
CALIFORNIA DOJ PERSONNEL

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:21.155
SEPARATELY ENTER INTO AND- LOW

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:22.657
IT'S AUTOMATIC IT'S AN

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.859
AUTOMATIC TRANSFER SO ONCE SO

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.828
ONCE IT'S ENTERED INTO CLASS

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:28.596
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:32.767
INTO NCIC CRACKED OKAY SO NCIC

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:35.636
IS THE SYSTEM THAT WE SHOULD.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:38.339
THINK OF AS THE PRIMARY FEDERAL

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:41.209
DATABASE FOR ALL MISSING PERSON

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:43.711

CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE WITH

ONE ANOTHER IN OTHER WORDS.

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:12.840
BECAUSE SOMETHING IS BECAUSE A

MISSING PERSON IS UP LOADED

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:16.677
INTO ONE SYSTEM DOESN'T

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.279
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY CAN

BE AUTOMATICALLY UPLOADED INTO

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.717
ANOTHER SYSTEM AND THEIR

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:25.753
REASONS. THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.589
ENTERED INTO BY CAP. AS OPPOSED

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:29.991

FEDERAL AND STATE MANDATES

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:37.231
INDICATE THAT A LOCAL LAW

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:38.566
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ABSOLUTELY

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:41.302
MUST ENTER ANY MISSING PERSON

INTO THE MISSING PERSON SYSTEM

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:44.539
AND I'M JUST FOR CLARIFICATION

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:46.574
IT'S NO THERE'S NO LONGER THE

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:47.708
FOUR HOUR REQUIREMENT FOR

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:50.645
ADULTS- THAT LARGE CHANGE I

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:52.413
THINK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.383
IT'S TWO HOURS ACROSS THE BOARD

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:57.451
FOR ANYONE AT RISK OR ANY CHILD

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.587
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE.

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:01.589
AND THEN WITHOUT DELAY FOR

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:05.259
ANYONE ELSE. FOR THERE WAS A

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:07.128
FOUR HOUR DELAY WITH. THEIR

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.730
WEST UP TO TWENTY FIFTEEN YES I

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:12.266
BELIEVE TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT I'D

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:13.801
HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK TO OUR-

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:15.703
MUST BE COMPLETE TRANSMISSION

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:18.706
WITHIN TWO HOURS FOR. FOR ANY

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:20.508
ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:21.642
ONE AND ANYONE CONSIDERED AT

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:22.810
RISK AND THE PENAL CODE

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:24.545
DESCRIBES WHO'S CONSIDERED AT

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:26.914
RISK I DON'T KNOW THE CRITERIA

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.683
OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. BUT IT

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:30.451
WOULD INCLUDE DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:33.955
DISABLED ADULTS- ANYONE WHO'S

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.323
CONSIDERED TO BE AT HARM

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:37.391
PHYSICAL PHYSICAL HARM THERE'S

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:38.860
ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT SETS OF

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:40.995
CRITERIA FOR AT RISK IS THERE

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:46.500
MUCH I'M SORRY. IT SAYS HERE

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.402
FIRST TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:49.770
HOURS AT THE MOST CRITICAL FOR

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:51.772
A MISSING PERSON. IS THAT

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:55.109
ACROSS. IS THAT ACROSS THE

01:31:55.176 --> 01:32:00.181
BOARD WITH. MINERS AND ADULTS

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:06.687
OR IS IT DIFFERENT. FOR MINOR'S.

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:08.990
IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:10.992
OF THE CASE IF THE MINOR IS A

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:14.595
RUNAWAY VERSES THE MINERS BEEN.

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:18.232
TAKEN BY AN ADULT- THE NUMBERS

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:21.669
ARE ARE GREATLY DIFFERENT. SO

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.671
THERE'S THE WASHINGTON STATE

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:28.075
STUDY- THAT LOOKED AT. CHILDREN

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:30.244
THAT WERE ABDUCTED FOR SEXUAL

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.747
PURPOSES AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:36.317
MURDERED- THOSE NUMBERS THE

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.586
TIME FRAME IS MUCH SHORTER SO

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.554
THE CRITICAL TIME FRAME FOR

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:43.024
THOSE CASES IS THREE HOURS. AND

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.493
THEN THE RATE OF LIKELIHOOD OF

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:47.662
THEM BEING FOUND DECEASED GOES

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:51.632
UP 291% I BELIEVE WITHIN TWENTY

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:53.935
FOUR HOURS. IF THEY'RE NOT

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:54.502
RECOVERED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:57.538
HOURS. IN THEIR UNDER EIGHTEEN

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.473
THEY HAVE A 90% OR FICTION IF

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.176
THEY RENTAL. FOR THAT THAT

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:05.713
UNIQUE CATEGORY. 90% EXPECTED

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:10.685
TO SEE STRAIGHT. BUT I CAN GET

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:11.752
YOU THAT STUDY AS WELL IF YOU'D

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:15.022
LIKE I WOULD ADD TO THAT STATE

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:16.991
LEGISLATION PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.993
THAT THE REPORTS BE DONE FROM

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.628
THE LOCAL LEVEL TO THE

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:23.497
CALIFORNIA DOJ ONLY FOR MISSING

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:25.866
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.668
THE AT THE AGE OF I BELIEVE IT

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.770
WAS EIGHTEEN. POINT NINE THAT

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:31.939
RECENTLY AND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:34.208
WE CHANGED THE LAW WITH SENATE

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:35.609
BILL TEN SIXTY SIX REQUIRE

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:37.778
REPORTING OF ALL MISSING ADULTS

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:40.281
IN ADDITION TO TWO CHILDREN

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:42.883
YOUNG PEOPLE. CAN YOU CAN YOU

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.485
DESCRIBE FOR US YOUR

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:47.722
INTERACTION WITH NAMYS YES- SO

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:50.992
WE AT. WITHIN MAPS AND WE WORK

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:53.861
WITH NAY MISS EVERY SINGLE DAY-

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.496
WE DO HAVE ONE POSITION WHEN

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:57.498
ANALYST POSITION THAT IS

01:33:57.565 --> 01:34:00.167
ASSIGNED TO NAME S. WE

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:03.938
COLLABORATE WITH THEM SO- IF A

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:05.673
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.842
A FAMILY MEMBER. REQUEST THAT

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:10.177
WE- PROVIDE INFORMATION TO NAME

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.879
S. WE DO SO AND THAT'S

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:12.880
GENERALLY BIOMETRIC

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:16.217
INFORMATION- FINGERPRINTS.

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:19.186
DENTAL RECORDS PHOTOGRAPHS. IF

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:21.255
WE HAVE CASE REPORTS ON FILED

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:23.190
WILL PROVIDE THAT AS WELL-

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:25.026
ENTRIES CAN BE MADE INTO NAME

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:26.694
IS BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:28.496
AGENCIES OR BY FAMILY MEMBERS

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:32.867
OR BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC.

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:35.036
I'M CURRENTLY OUR METHOD OF

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:36.570
GETTING THAT INFORMATION AND TO

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:38.706
NAME A SO IS MANUAL. WITH WE

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:40.107
ENTER THE DATA INTO OUR STATE

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:41.242
DATABASE AND THEN WE TURN

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:43.044
AROUND AND LOG INTO NAME S. AND

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:45.046
WE ENTER THE DATA INTO THEIR

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:46.947
MANUALLY WE DID LOOK AT PROCESS

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:49.016
I SEE THERE'S NO WAY TO

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:51.385
DIRECTLY TRANSFER ANY OF THE

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:53.220
INFORMATION TO NAME S. THERE'S

01:34:53.287 --> 01:34:55.156
NOT A SINGLE BUTTON WE CAN

01:34:55.222 --> 01:34:56.891
HEAD. AND SAY PLEASE THAT MET

01:34:56.957 --> 01:35:00.227
THE CINEMAS AND UPLOAD THIS NOW

01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:03.464
SO IT'S JUST NOT THAT SIMPLE.

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.366
BUT IT IS A GREAT RESOURCE AND-

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:08.035
AS I STATED EARLIER IT THEY'RE

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:08.636
ONE OF THE PARTNERS THAT WE

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:10.171
TRAIN WITH AT ALL OF OUR

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:12.706
TRAINING- IN FACT I THINK THE

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:14.975
NAME IS PRESENTATION MIGHT BE

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:15.509
GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IN SAN

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:19.246
DIEGO. IF THERE WAS EL A STATE

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:22.049
LAW TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE A

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:24.151
REQUIREMENT THAT INDIVIDUALS BE

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:25.519
UPLOADED INTO EIGHT NAME IS

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:26.454
WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.956
TIME FRAME IN YOUR VIEW. FOR AN

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:31.559
INDIVIDUAL TO BE MISSING BEFORE

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:34.128
MANDATE BE ISSUE THAT THEY BE.

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:36.230
REPORTED TO NAME S. AS WELL. I

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.398
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:39.834
NEED TO LOOK FURTHER INTO AND

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.735
PROBABLY DISCUSS DIRECTLY WITH

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:44.872
NAME S. AS WELL. AS TO THE

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:47.808
CAPABILITIES- FOR BOTH OF OUR

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.844
SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:51.812
IN ADDITION THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:54.248
AGENCIES WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:56.484
PROVIDE IMPACT AS TO. HOW LONG

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:57.751
THAT MIGHT TAKE IF SOMEONE IS

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:59.153
SUPPOSED TO MANUALLY ENTER

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:01.789
SOMEONE INTO. IN DOUBLE

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:04.792
SYSTEMS. ABSOLUTELY AND WE

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.093
WOULD IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN ON

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.394
WE WOULD HOPE AN ELECTRONIC

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.497
INTERFACE WHERE WE COULD SEND

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:13.434

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:35.256
BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A

THE CASES. ON THE TOP OF OUR

LIST WOULD BE A CASE MANAGEMENT

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:49.069
SYSTEM MORE WE COULD TAKE OUR

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:50.704
MANUAL FOLDERS WE HAVE

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:53.741

IMPROVE OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:24.305
OUR SERVICES THAT WE COULD

COULD HAVE. A CASE MANAGEMENT

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:33.214

THAT THEY HAVE DINNER. THAT

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.445
THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE COMPATIBLE

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:07.348
ENOUGH THAT IF CHANGES IN ONE

01:38:07.414 --> 01:38:09.083
ARE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED

MANAGEMENT BUT IT IS THIS NOT A

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:19.860
TECH ELIGIBLE SOLUTION IT'S

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:21.895
BOTH THE TECHNOLOGY COULD EXIST

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:24.498
IF WE BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM OUR

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:27.334
STATE SYSTEM IS. FAIRLY OLD I'M

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:30.204
IT'S BUILT ON MESSAGE KEYS- THE

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:32.072
COURT SYSTEM MESSAGE WHAT'S-

01:38:32.139 --> 01:38:33.574
THERE IS TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:34.975
ALLOW YOU TO DO IT BUT IT'S

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:38.112
RESOURCES MONETARY RESOURCES

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:41.215

WE LIVE IN. A DATA DRIVEN WORLD

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.907
LISTEN THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE IF

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:10.978
APPROPRIATIONS AND TRYING TO.

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:14.348
PUSH FOR THE IMMEDIACY OF THE

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:25.893
SOME INSTANCES AND UNDER THREE

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:30.864
THERE INSTANCES WHERE IS THERE

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:32.633
ANY METRICS ARE ANY HIT DATA

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.969
HISTORY THAT INDICATES THE TIME

01:39:36.036 --> 01:39:38.305
IT TAKES TO UPLOAD INFORMATION.

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:41.575
FROM ONE SOURCE INTO A SECOND

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.210
AND THAT SECOND BEING WITH IN A

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:44.345
JURISDICTION THAT COULD HAVE

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:45.512
OTHERWISE BEEN HELPFUL IN

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:47.781
TRACKING AN INDIVIDUAL. USING

01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:49.149
THE TIME LINES THAT WE'RE

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:54.455
JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.123
APPROPRIATION COULD SOUND LIKE

01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:58.392
THERE WOULD BE. THAT YOU'RE

01:39:58.459 --> 01:40:00.361
ACTUALLY SAVING LIVES BY A

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:02.196
INTEROPERABLE IMPROVING THE

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:05.332
SYSTEMS. WE WOULD BE IMPROVING

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:07.000
THE INTER OPERABILITY BUT WE DO

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:08.535
HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE THROUGH

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.104

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.578
WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER MANAGE

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:19.646
IT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND TO MAKE

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:21.582

01:54:12.645 --> 01:54:15.014
AWAY AND THERE. THE ACCURACY OF

01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:16.583
THE RECORD CONTINUES TO DWINDLE

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:19.586

WE'RE DOING THOSE ENTRIES AS

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:34.400

ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM AND

01:54:51.251 --> 01:54:52.719
THEN TAKEN BACK OUT. BECAUSE

01:54:52.785 --> 01:54:54.254
THEY WERE FOUND IN AND THE

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.222
NUMBER IS ASTOUNDING IT IS AND

01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:58.491
IT CAN BE. EXHAUSTIVE

01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:00.460

02:00:58.918 --> 02:00:59.919
EITHER THE CLIENT OTHER FAMILY

02:00:59.986 --> 02:01:01.687
MEMBER. AND SO WE PROVIDE THEM

02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:02.421
A SCRIPT THAT THEY CAN CARRY IN

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:04.223
THEIR WALLET OR THE WE'VE MADE

02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:05.458
THEM A MAGNET THAT THEY CAN PUT

02:01:05.524 --> 02:01:07.727
ON ON THE FRIDGE. AND IT TELLS

02:01:07.793 --> 02:01:09.829
THEM EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY WHEN

02:01:09.895 --> 02:01:11.897
THEY CALL NINE ONE- INCLUDING

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:14.133
THE FREQUENCY THAT IS UNIQUE TO

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.868
THAT CLIENT. I WOULD LIKE A

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:17.603
VERY SMALL DEMONSTRATION YES

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:19.672
PLEASE OKAY. SO THIS IS LASSEN

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:23.109
EIGHTY. THIS IS ADAM. WHAT THE

02:01:23.175 --> 02:01:25.511
RECEIVER LOOKS LIKE AND AS YOU

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:28.514
CAN SEE IT'S VERY SIMPLE ALL IT

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:29.782
IS JUST LIKE A RADIO RECEIVER

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:31.484
LIKE YOU'D SEE BACK IN THE

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:33.753
SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES. AND BUT

02:01:33.819 --> 02:01:35.021
THE REASON WHY WE CHOSE THIS IS

02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:36.322
BECAUSE THE TOP LOCKERBIE IN

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:37.456
CITRUS HEIGHTS IS SUCH THAT WE

02:01:37.523 --> 02:01:39.558
HAVE LARGE OPEN GREEN SPACES WE

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:41.427
HAVE SEVERAL MILES OF CREEK

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.829
AREA BUT WE ALSO HAVE APARTMENT

02:01:43.896 --> 02:01:45.064
BUILDINGS IT'S A BEDROOM

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:46.799
COMMUNITY FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:48.768
MEET FOR WORK. SO WE HAVE THESE

02:01:48.834 --> 02:01:50.036
HUGE APARTMENT COMPLEXES WE

02:01:50.102 --> 02:01:52.605
HAVE EIGHTY THE AM I EIGHTY

02:01:52.672 --> 02:01:54.340
THAT RUNS THROUGH THE CITY WE

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:55.975
WANT THIS BILL TO WORK THROUGH

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:57.543
CONCRETE WE WANT THIS TO WORK

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.378
THROUGH STEEL AND THAT'S WHY WE

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:01.614
CHOSE A RADIO BASED PROGRAM AS

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:03.549
OPPOSED TO A GPS PROGRAM. LESS

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:05.184
EXPENSIVE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:08.220
CHARGED EVERY TWELVE HOURS AND

02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:08.854
IT WORKS THROUGH ALL OF THESE.

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:10.723
HERE'S THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:12.258
FOUND WITH A LOT OF THE GPS

02:02:12.324 --> 02:02:14.727
SOLUTIONS. WAS THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:16.529
KEEP TAKING IT OFF OF THE

02:02:16.595 --> 02:02:17.463
CLIENT IN ORDER TO CHARGE IT

02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:19.131
OVERNIGHT. WELL WHEN THESE

02:02:19.198 --> 02:02:23.069
FOLKS. WONDER SOMETIMES IT'S

02:02:23.135 --> 02:02:24.437
DUE TO SUNDOWNERS IF YOU'RE

02:02:24.503 --> 02:02:25.971
FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM HAM

02:02:26.038 --> 02:02:28.007
WITH FOLKS I HAVE DEMENTIA. AND

02:02:28.074 --> 02:02:29.575
SO THEN THEY HAVE TAKEN OFF THE

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:31.110
DEVICE TO CHARGE IT AND THEN

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:32.611
THAT'S WHEN THEY WONDER. OR

02:02:32.678 --> 02:02:34.847
WITH THE KIDS DOUBLE AND RAN

02:02:34.914 --> 02:02:36.716
AND IT'S LEFT ON THE CHARGING

02:02:36.782 --> 02:02:38.484
STATIONS WE WANTED THIS DEVICE

02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:39.385
TO NEVER COME OFF THEIR BODIES

02:02:39.452 --> 02:02:42.888
SO. THE ACTUAL TRANSMITTER THAT

02:02:42.955 --> 02:02:45.291
THEY WHERE IS AND WATER

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:46.992
RESISTANT SO THEY CAN STILL DO

02:02:47.059 --> 02:02:48.227
THEIR WATER THERAPY THEY CAN

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:50.496
SWIM THEY CAN BATHE AND IT

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:53.532
STAYS ON THEIR PERSON. THE ONLY

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:54.734
TIME WE TAKE OFF IS WHEN WE TO

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.001
ABOUT AND WE PUT IT RIGHT BACK

02:02:56.068 --> 02:03:01.307
ON. WE'VE HAD BEEN RAMP. SEVEN

02:03:01.373 --> 02:03:02.808
YEARS. AND I'VE GROWN UP WITH

02:03:02.875 --> 02:03:04.777
IT SOME OF OUR LITTLE GUYS. AND

02:03:04.844 --> 02:03:06.145
THEN WE HAVE AND SOME OF OUR

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:08.481
OLDER CLIENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN

02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:09.048
ON THE PROGRAM FOR A SHORTER

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:12.051
TIME. AND IN THE NAY H. OUT OF

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:13.652
THE PROGRAM AS WELL. SO MY

02:03:13.719 --> 02:03:15.321
PARTNER NIKKI IS WEARING ONE OF

02:03:15.387 --> 02:03:16.922
THE DEVICES ON A REST. AND

02:03:16.989 --> 02:03:17.823
BASICALLY ONCE YOU GET A

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.825
SIGNAL. THE AVERAGE RECOVERY

02:03:19.892 --> 02:03:22.194
TIME WITH THIS DEVICE IS THIRTY

02:03:22.261 --> 02:03:24.597
MINUTES OR LESS. WHICH I A

02:03:24.663 --> 02:03:26.599
HUGE BECAUSE IT TAKES A SEARCH

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:28.734
THAT THE AVERAGE SEARCH TIME

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.903
FOR AN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT IS

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:32.905
NINE HOURS. NATIONALLY AN

02:03:32.972 --> 02:03:36.475
AVERAGE. COST OF A SEARCHES

02:03:36.542 --> 02:03:37.042
FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:39.378
HOUR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

02:03:39.445 --> 02:03:40.112
HOW MANY RESOURCES HERE

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:43.582
UTILIZING. SO WITH THIS PROGRAM

02:03:43.649 --> 02:03:44.517
WE HAVE GOTTEN THAT SEARCH TIME

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:46.485
FROM THE- FROM ONLY START THE

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:47.920
SEARCH WITH THE EQUIPMENT TO

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.088
THIRTY MINUTES OR LESS AND YOU

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:51.090
ONLY NEED. THREE OFFICERS TO

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:52.658
OPERATE AS YOU'RE NOT TO PLAN

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:53.993
YOUR ENTIRE CADRE FOLKS

02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:56.796
NECESSARILY. COURSE OF THE

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:57.363
CRITICAL MISSING WE STILL DO

02:03:57.429 --> 02:04:01.834
INITIALLY BUT- AND- SO THIS

02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:04.203
PLAN HAS TO BE ON A SIX BECAUSE

02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:06.071
THIS OPERATES ON A TWO ONE SIX

02:04:06.138 --> 02:04:07.573
MEGAHERTZ CHANNEL AND THESE

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.841
LAST THREE BUTTONS HAVE TO BE

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:11.410
ON THE UNIQUE FREQUENCY FOR THE

02:04:11.477 --> 02:04:12.778
CLIENTS EACH CLAN MEMBER HAS A

02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:14.146
UNIQUE THREE DIGIT FREE

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:15.781
CONCERTS ASSIGNED TO THEM AND

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.716
THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE SIGNAL

02:04:17.783 --> 02:04:18.818
IT'S REALLY LIKE PLAYING PONG

02:04:18.884 --> 02:04:20.352
COLD THE LOUDER THE

02:04:20.419 --> 02:04:22.121
TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU ARE.

02:04:32.965 --> 02:04:34.600
THAT'S WHAT I'M LISTENING FOR

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:38.771
IF I GO THIS WAY. IT GETS HIRED

02:04:38.838 --> 02:04:41.807
SOMEONE THE WRONG WAY. THEN A

02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:48.981
LOWLY TURN. YES NOW I KNOW THAT

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:50.482
THIS WAY IS THE RIGHT PERSON

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:51.283
YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THE

02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:53.319
DELEGATE BUT DANCING SOMETHING

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:56.455
THAT'S METAL IN THE ROOM BUT I

02:04:56.522 --> 02:05:01.727
KNOW THIS FOR. OUR HEY. AND IT

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:02.294
JUST KEPT GETTING LOUDER AND

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:04.930
LOUDER. YEAH THAT MIGHT BE IN

02:05:04.997 --> 02:05:09.168
IT WHILE IS THE AYE WHILE IS A

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:12.705
REQUIREMENT SO IT SMALL. AND IT

02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:14.306
IS IT'S SMALL AND IT'S COST

02:05:14.373 --> 02:05:15.741
EFFECTIVE AND IT'S NOT

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:17.343
BURDENSOME FOR THEM TO WEAR

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:18.277
SOME OF THE CASES WE'VE

02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:19.612
ACTUALLY START ORDERING AND

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:20.713
SOME FUN COLORS FOR THE

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:22.648
CHILDREN AND THAT ARE AUTISTIC-

02:05:22.715 --> 02:05:24.049
HAVE DOWN SYNDROME OR DRAMATIC

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:26.018
BRAIN INJURY. SO THEY CAN

02:05:26.085 --> 02:05:26.819
CHOOSE A COLOR THAT THEY LIKE

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:28.354
AND THEN THEY'RE MORE AT THAT

02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:30.823
LIKELY TO WEAR IT. AND WE HAVE

02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:32.157
SOME FABRIC BANDS LITTLE BIT

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:33.893
MORE COMFORTABLE FOR OUR OLDER

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:36.896
FOLKS WHO ARE IN CARE HOMES TO

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:38.864
WEAR BECAUSE IN OTHER SKIN GETS

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:41.834
VERY FRAIL THE ONE THAT IS

02:05:41.901 --> 02:05:43.802
COMFORTABLE FOR THEM TO WEAR.

02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:46.338
AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT EVEN

02:05:46.405 --> 02:05:46.872
IF THEY'RE NOT A LOCKDOWN

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:47.873
TREATMENT CENTER THAT

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:50.209
SPECIALIZES IN MEMORY KERR THAT

02:05:50.276 --> 02:05:50.876
THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WANDER.

02:05:50.943 --> 02:05:52.811
YOU'RE SURPRISED. THEY ARE SO

02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:56.548
CLEVER. AND I HAVE TO SMILE A

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:57.116
BIT BECAUSE WE HAD A CLIENT

02:05:57.182 --> 02:05:59.285
AND- HER NAME IS DOROTHY AND I

02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:01.186
WAS VERY FOND OF HER. AND WE

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:02.922
WOULD WATCH HER AND YOU IN

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:03.989
ORDER TO GET OUT OF HER

02:06:04.056 --> 02:06:05.457
CAREFULLY YOU HAD TO HAVE TWO

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:06.892
PEOPLE PUSH BUTTONS ON OPPOSING

02:06:06.959 --> 02:06:07.826
WALLS IN ORDER FOR THE FRONT

02:06:07.893 --> 02:06:09.662
DOORS TO OPEN. AND SHE WAS

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.397
STAND THERE AND WAIT TO

02:06:11.463 --> 02:06:11.997
INTEREST WITH BY AND THEN SHE

02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:12.898
TRIED TO BRIBE. TO PUSH THE

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:14.867
OTHER BUTTON. AND SHE ACTUALLY

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:16.302
GOT OUT ONE TIME SHE WAS

02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:17.636
SUCCESSFUL IN WRITING SOME TO

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:18.470
PUSH THE OTHER BUTTON SO SHE

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:20.639
COULD. HELLO AND SHE WENT AND

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:22.274
SHE FOUND AN UNLOCKED CURRENT

YOU KNOW AND SHE WAS JUST VERY

02:06:34.987 --> 02:06:35.554
CLEVER SO EVEN WHEN THEY ARE.

02:06:35.621 --> 02:06:37.323
THE WALK DOWN MEMORY WAR IT'S

02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:38.490
GOOD TO HAVE THIS EXTRA LAYER

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:41.427
PRECAUTION. AND FOR AND THAT

02:06:41.493 --> 02:06:42.928
HAVE THIS PROGRAM EVEN WHEN

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.663
THEIR CHILD. AND WHAT WOULD

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:46.932
SEND. BEEN A PART OF IT. IT'S

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.534
AN ADDED WELFARE CHECK AND IT'S

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.703
AN ADDED LAYER OF RESOURCES FOR

02:06:50.769 --> 02:06:52.004
US TO GIVE TO THAT FAMILY.

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:53.305
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS-

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:54.606
LONELIER THAN BEING A

02:06:54.673 --> 02:06:56.909
CAREGIVER. I THINK THOSE OF US

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.344
WHO HAVE HAD CHILDREN AND

02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:00.379
NOTICE LIKE TO BE. THERE FOR

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:01.814
LONG DAYS A SMALL CHILDREN THAT

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:04.283
CAN BE MENTALLY TAXING. BUT TO

02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:07.453
THINK ABOUT DOING THAT FOR A

02:07:07.519 --> 02:07:09.621
PARENT WHOSE. HAS YOU KNOW

02:07:09.688 --> 02:07:11.223
THESE MOMENTS OF ANGER AND

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:13.892
CONFUSION. IT BECOMES EVEN

02:07:13.959 --> 02:07:15.027
LONELIER STILLNESS STRETCHES

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:17.363
OUT FOR YEARS THEY DON'T GROW

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:18.063
OUT OF THAT PHASE LIKE A

02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:21.000
TODDLER DOES IT JUST PROGRESSES.

02:07:21.066 --> 02:07:22.935
AND WE'VE HAD OUR VOLUNTEERS GO

02:07:23.002 --> 02:07:25.938
OUT AND TO DO THESE BATTERY

02:07:26.005 --> 02:07:26.872
CHANGES AND IT'S BECOME KIND OF

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:28.574
A SMALL WELFARE CHECK FOR THE

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.476
FAMILY. JUST ASK HOW ARE YOU

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:32.177

02:07:32.244 --> 02:07:34.580
TINO RESPITE CARE IS CAN WE GET

02:07:34.646 --> 02:07:37.149
YOU CONNECTED WITH AN OMBUDSMAN

02:07:37.216 --> 02:07:38.851
OR SOMEONE FROM SOCIAL WORK

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:39.985
THAT COULD COME IN AND HELP

02:07:40.052 --> 02:07:41.920
YOU. AND WE'VE HAD TIMES WE'VE

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:43.122
GONE OUT DURING THE HOLIDAYS

02:07:43.188 --> 02:07:45.624

TO PUBLISH THOSE IN OUR SYSTEM.

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:21.980
ON THE IDENTIFIED TO SEE INSIDE

02:15:22.047 --> 02:15:24.115
WE HAVE CURRENTLY TWO THOUSAND

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:24.950
SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT

02:15:25.016 --> 02:15:27.252

PERSONS WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:33.258

CALIFORNIA'S. SHOULD WA. OVER

02:15:43.802 --> 02:15:47.205
SEVEN THAT THOUSAND. ACTIVE

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:51.643
MISS PURSING. THE US VICE WE

02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:53.712
HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND CASES. NO

02:15:53.778 --> 02:15:54.613
ONE OF THE PRIME PUSHES THE

02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:55.547
CREATION OF NEW IS K. FROM THE

02:15:55.614 --> 02:15:57.649
EXAMINER. COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE

02:15:57.716 --> 02:15:59.451
HAD AGENCIES WHO WERE TASKED

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:01.219
WITH IDENTIFYING REMAINS WHO

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:02.687
HAD VERY LITTLE TOOLS AT THEIR

02:16:02.754 --> 02:16:04.356
DISCRETION TO DO SO. THEY

02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:06.157
DIDN'T HAVE A CENTRAL DATABASE

02:16:06.224 --> 02:16:08.593
THAT THEY COULD ALL ACCESS 80%

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:09.728
OF OUR MEDICAL EXAMINERS IN

02:16:09.794 --> 02:16:11.530
CORNERS IN THE UNITED STATES

02:16:11.596 --> 02:16:14.065
RARELY OR NEVER USE NCIC.

02:16:14.132 --> 02:16:16.568
MAJORITY HAVE NO ACCESS TO NCIC

02:16:16.635 --> 02:16:18.303
SO THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:19.838
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

02:16:19.905 --> 02:16:21.139

ENTER THAT WAS ON IDENTIFIED

02:16:23.275 --> 02:16:25.076
CASES FOR THEM. THE OTHER SIDE

02:16:25.143 --> 02:16:26.811
OF THAT COIN IS THAT THEN THEY

02:16:26.878 --> 02:16:28.880
HAVE NO DIRECT ACCESS TO SEARCH

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:30.715
FOR A MISSING PERSON MATCHES.

02:16:30.782 --> 02:16:31.516
FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:33.218

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.753

INITIAL ROLLOUT OF NAME AS OUR

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:38.123

02:16:38.189 --> 02:16:38.890
THAT WENT LIVE WAS ON

02:16:38.957 --> 02:16:41.026
IDENTIFIED DECEDENTS. AND TODAY

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:44.796

02:16:48.199 --> 02:16:49.501
FOR PASSES NUMBER OF DECEIT

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:52.170
BETTER IN AND THE ICY BECAUSE

02:16:52.237 --> 02:16:54.139

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:59.377
SYSTEM INCORPORATES EVERYONE

02:16:59.444 --> 02:17:01.813
INTO ONE DATABASE. SO WE DO

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.049
ALLOW ANYONE TO MAKE AN INITIAL

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:05.684
MISSING PERSON REPORT TO NAME

02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:08.486

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:26.671
BECAUSE OF COURSE WE WANT TO

A MISSING PERSON REPORT FILED

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:38.009

THERE WAS NO MISSING. FIVE IN A

02:18:54.025 --> 02:18:55.393
CASE LIKE THAT IS THERE A

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:56.661
RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU WOULD

MEMBER. YES AND WE DO THAT

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:09.140
COMMONLY SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:11.409
ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND

02:19:11.476 --> 02:19:13.178
PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

IN THE NAME A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW

02:19:17.615 --> 02:19:19.084
SO WHEN A FAMILY REPORTS TO

02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:20.952

02:19:21.019 --> 02:19:22.287

ALREADY IN THE NAME IS NETWORK.

02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:29.527
SO THEY'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:31.129
WITH THE CHALLENGES FACING

02:19:31.196 --> 02:19:34.466
PERSON CASES WE CAN REACH OUT

FORCE. LOCATE THOSE FAMILY

02:19:42.273 --> 02:19:44.375
FIRST. BECAUSE OFTEN WE

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:46.811
RECEIVED VERY LONG TERM CASES

02:19:46.878 --> 02:19:47.946
IN NAME IS AND I DON'T KNOW

02:19:48.012 --> 02:19:48.780

BEGINNING STAGES 95% OF THE

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.418
CASES THAT ARE REPORTED TO NAME

02:19:53.485 --> 02:19:55.153
S. ARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:56.921
MISSING ONE YEAR OR MORE. WHAT

02:19:56.988 --> 02:19:58.490
A LOT OF AGENTS MIGHT DEEM A

02:19:58.556 --> 02:20:00.325
COLD CASE AND I KNOW WE TALKED

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:01.626
ABOUT DEFINITIONS OF COLD

02:20:01.693 --> 02:20:04.028
CASES. FOR ME THAT'S A CASE

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:05.764
WHERE THE POOR STATE AGENCIES

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:07.532
HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED ALL OF

02:20:07.599 --> 02:20:10.101
THEIR INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES.

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:12.003
AND THEY FEAR THAT FELL PLAYS

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:13.371
IT HEARD IN THERE LOOKING TO

02:20:13.438 --> 02:20:16.474
COMPARE THAT MISSY PERSON.

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:18.076
IDENTIFY DECEIT. SO WE HAVE

AN UNIDENTIFIED THAT SERVICE.

02:20:28.219 --> 02:20:30.221
REALLY A FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR

02:20:30.288 --> 02:20:31.756
THE AGENCIES THAT WORK WITH

02:20:31.823 --> 02:20:33.324
NAMYS. SO THEY'RE AN EXTRA SET

02:20:33.391 --> 02:20:35.026

02:20:37.462 --> 02:20:39.297
THAT CAN HELP THEM TRACK DOWN

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:40.598
THOSE FAMILY. FIRST AND EVEN

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:41.933
FACILITATE THOSE THE IN

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.269
COLLECTIONS SOMEONE MISSING IN

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:45.089
BECAUSE WE HEAR FROM FAMILIES

CASE THEY CAN SEARCH FOR

02:23:04.943 --> 02:23:06.277

AUTOMATICALLY COMPARE MISSED.

02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:29.934
THIS TO A DENTAL TO SEE. ON THE-

02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:33.771
SUB OF CRITERIA SO. JEAN RATE

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:35.540
THIS DE SAC HIGH EIGHT BUT

02:23:35.606 --> 02:23:37.208
ALSO. SOME EVER BEEN XIN IT

02:23:37.275 --> 02:23:39.177

02:23:39.243 --> 02:23:39.811
ONE WITH THE RAY TATTOO. I CAN

02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:40.845
DO A WORDS FOR ROAST. I CAN

02:23:40.912 --> 02:23:42.747
LOOK FOR THAT TIMEX WATCH I CAN

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:44.816
LOOK FOR THAT SHOE SIZE OR THAT

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.084
NAME BRAND OF CLOTHING THAT I

02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:47.618
KNEW THEY WERE WEARING. HIS

02:23:47.685 --> 02:23:49.988
SEARCH FOR SCARS MARKS TATTOOS

02:23:50.054 --> 02:23:52.490
ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS

02:23:52.557 --> 02:23:54.625
SEARCHABLE TO THE PUBLIC. CAN'T

02:23:54.692 --> 02:23:56.361
PUBLIC MEMBER KNOW WHETHER

02:23:56.427 --> 02:23:58.329
THERE IS DNA ON FILE FOR THEIR

02:23:58.396 --> 02:24:00.832
LOVED ONE WE DO NOT PROVIDE

02:24:00.898 --> 02:24:02.200
THAT INFORMATION PUBLICLY AND

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:03.568
THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR

02:24:03.634 --> 02:24:05.770
THAT. THE FIRST IS WE HAVE A

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:07.438
LOT OF CASES WHERE MAYBE FAMILY

02:24:07.505 --> 02:24:09.507
MEMBERS AREN'T IN CONTACT WITH

02:24:09.574 --> 02:24:11.075
ONE ANOTHER AND SO FOR PRIVACY

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:13.511
REASONS WE DON'T DISCLOSE THAT

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.513
THIS RELATIVE GAVE DNA VERSES

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:17.682
THIS RELATIVE WHO DID NOT. THE

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.984
OTHER REASON WE THERE USED TO

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:21.486
BE MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:23.821
IN NAME IS THAT. BASICALLY JUST

02:24:23.888 --> 02:24:25.890
THE DNA IS AVAILABLE OR IS NOT

02:24:25.957 --> 02:24:28.226
AVAILABLE. WHAT WE FOUND IS

02:24:28.292 --> 02:24:29.394
WHEN THE VICTIM ADVOCATE

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.329
COMMUNITY WAS RUNNING SEARCHES

02:24:31.396 --> 02:24:32.764
THROUGH NAME IS FOR POTENTIAL

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:34.365
MATCHES THEY WERE MAKING

02:24:34.432 --> 02:24:36.267
ASSUMPTIONS THAT BECAUSE THE

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:38.469
SYSTEM SAYS DNA IS AVAILABLE I

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:40.271
DON'T NEED TO REPORT THIS TIP.

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:41.739
BECAUSE DNA WOULD HAVE MADE THE

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:45.076
MATCH. THAN IN A IS AVAILABLE

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:47.578
BUT- AS THEIR ASSUME NEW. THESE

02:24:47.645 --> 02:24:50.081
WILL MATCH. DNA IS NOT ALWAYS

02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:51.115
GOING TO PRODUCE AN

02:24:51.182 --> 02:24:54.018
ASSOCIATION. WE MAY NOT HAVE

02:24:54.085 --> 02:24:55.953
ENOUGH FAMILY FRIEND SAMPLES WE

02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:57.422

HEARD A LOT OF THE RESOURCES-

02:28:04.575 --> 02:28:07.712

NOW THAT. THAT INITIAL SEARCH

02:28:24.328 --> 02:28:24.996
WHEN SOMEBODY'S REPORTED

02:28:43.114 --> 02:28:45.983
BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND- THE

ROLE OF DETECTIVE BASICALLY HAS

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:53.124
GONE TO WHERE- WE- GET INVOLVED

02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.991
IN THE CASE OR TAKE OVER THE

02:28:54.058 --> 02:28:56.027
CASE WHEN. ONE OF TWO THINGS

02:28:56.093 --> 02:28:58.029
HAPPENS THAT INITIAL SEARCH

02:28:58.095 --> 02:29:01.098
COMES UP EMPTY AND THINGS ARE

02:29:01.165 --> 02:29:02.533
GOING TO TURN LONG TERM WHERE.

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.603
THE INVESTIGATION TURNS INTO.

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:07.004
ESSENTIALLY A SEARCH OF THE

02:29:07.071 --> 02:29:11.309
REST OF THE WORLD- AND USING

02:29:11.375 --> 02:29:13.010
INVESTIGATIVE DATABASES AND

02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:16.514
MANY OF THE SOURCES NAY MISS-

02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:19.383
THAT TO BE ONE. TO TRY AND

02:29:19.450 --> 02:29:21.085
LOCATE THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:22.820
TURN UP SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO WHEN

02:29:22.887 --> 02:29:24.855
IT'S JUST GONE LONG TERM. THE

02:29:24.922 --> 02:29:26.924
OTHER WAY THE DETECTIVES GET

02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:29.794
INVOLVED IS AT FROM THE OUTSET

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:31.262

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.768
A KIDNAPPING THOSE SORTS OF

02:29:37.835 --> 02:29:38.969
THINGS WERE IT APPEARS TO BE A

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:41.205
CRIME FROM THE BEGINNING-

02:29:41.272 --> 02:29:43.674
THAT'S WHERE A DETECTIVE

02:29:43.741 --> 02:29:45.609
IDEALLY IS IN CHARGE OF FROM

02:29:45.676 --> 02:29:48.279
THE OUTSET OF THE- OF THE CASE.

02:29:48.346 --> 02:29:50.981
AND DIRECTING ALL OF THE

02:29:51.048 --> 02:29:54.385
AFOREMENTIONED RESOURCES TO-

02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:56.287
INTO USE IN THE INVESTIGATION

02:29:56.354 --> 02:30:00.624
APPROPRIATELY. AND DIRECTING-

02:30:00.691 --> 02:30:03.160
CANVASES- NEIGHBORHOOD AREA

02:30:03.227 --> 02:30:06.564
CAMPUSES- IN A VERY DETAILED

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:10.101
FASHION. BECAUSE THE SEARCHES

02:30:10.167 --> 02:30:12.203
NOW MORE THAN LOOKING FOR. THE

02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:14.372
MISSING PERSON THE SEARCHES

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:17.007
DEAD TO IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:19.944
EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE THAT MAY

02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:21.712
BECOME IMPORTANT AT SOME POINT

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:23.881
DOWN THE LINE. SO THAT WAS

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:25.750
BASICALLY THE TWO WAYS THAT-

02:30:25.816 --> 02:30:28.285
INVESTIGATORS AS A DETECTIVE

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:31.188
NOW GETS INVOLVED IN- A MISSING

02:30:31.255 --> 02:30:39.230
PERSON CASE. SO ONCE IT'S

02:30:39.296 --> 02:30:41.599
BECOME CLEAR THAT THEM THE

02:30:41.665 --> 02:30:44.468
MISSING PERSON HAS. THERE

02:30:44.535 --> 02:30:46.604
APPEARS TO BE A CRIME. AT THAT

02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:48.339
POINT IT WOULD HOW WOULD YOU

02:30:48.406 --> 02:30:49.740
COMMUNICATE WITH THE LOCAL LAW

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:51.776
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO ENSURE

02:30:51.842 --> 02:30:54.311
THAT THAT THERE IS FAMILIAL DNA

02:30:54.378 --> 02:30:57.615
ON FILE FOR A MISSING PERSON.

02:30:57.681 --> 02:30:58.215
WELL SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY

02:30:58.282 --> 02:30:59.383
TAKEN CARE OF BY LAW

02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:00.451
ENFORCEMENT IS IT SOMETHING

02:31:00.518 --> 02:31:02.019
THAT YOU NEED THAT YOU WORK

02:31:02.086 --> 02:31:03.187
WITH THEM TO VERIFY WELL IN

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:05.322
SPEAKING- JUST JUST TO CLARIFY

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:06.957
MIKE MY CURRENT ROLE IS AS A

02:31:07.024 --> 02:31:08.025
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR WITH THE

02:31:08.092 --> 02:31:09.093
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.795
THAT'S BEEN THE LAST TWO YEARS-

02:31:10.861 --> 02:31:12.062
PRIOR TO THAT I SPENT SIXTEEN

02:31:12.129 --> 02:31:16.200
YEARS AS A DETECTIVE WITH THE

02:31:16.267 --> 02:31:17.268
SECOND A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

02:31:17.334 --> 02:31:18.436
AND THE OLD GROVE POLICE

02:31:18.502 --> 02:31:20.938
DEPARTMENT. SO KIND OF WHAT I'M

02:31:21.005 --> 02:31:22.807
SPEAKING FROM IS THE LOCAL LAW

02:31:22.873 --> 02:31:25.576
ENFORCEMENT- DETECTIVE POINT OF

02:31:25.643 --> 02:31:27.945
VIEW- AS TO HOW WE WOULD WE

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:30.347
WOULD HANDLE THOSE CASES- IN

02:31:30.414 --> 02:31:32.817
ANY MISSING PERSON CASE- FROM

02:31:32.883 --> 02:31:34.652
THE OUTSET YOU KNOW WE INFORM

02:31:34.718 --> 02:31:36.187
THE- FAMILY THAT THEY HAVE A

02:31:36.253 --> 02:31:38.823
RIGHT IN HIGH RISK SITUATIONS

02:31:38.889 --> 02:31:42.059
TO SUBMIT. DNA AND THAT'S A

02:31:42.126 --> 02:31:45.129
RIGHT AND GO DO THAT WITHIN

02:31:45.196 --> 02:31:46.697
THIRTY DAYS HOWEVER IF WE'RE

02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:48.566
LOOKING AT SOME AND IT'S SUCH A

02:31:48.632 --> 02:31:51.001
CHILD ABDUCTION OR SOMETHING

02:31:51.068 --> 02:31:51.769
WE'VE- YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT

02:31:51.836 --> 02:31:55.139
ABOUT TWO. TIMES X. AND BECOME

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:56.574
LESS LIKELY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:31:56.640 --> 02:32:01.078
FIND A LIVING VICTIM- IT CAN BE

02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:02.947
YOU KNOW IT IS OUR PREROGATIVE

02:32:03.013 --> 02:32:06.550
RIGHT UP FRONT TO ASK PEOPLE TO

02:32:06.617 --> 02:32:09.553
VOLUNTEER THAT. BERMAN SAID

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:12.256
DETECTIVES POINT OF VIEW AND TO

02:32:12.323 --> 02:32:14.758
QUESTION EVERYTHING A LOT OF

02:32:14.825 --> 02:32:16.794
MISSING PERSON CASES ARE

02:32:16.861 --> 02:32:21.465
HOMICIDES AND THE MISS TEEN.

02:32:21.532 --> 02:32:22.833
THE PERSON REPORTING THE

02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:24.702
MISSING PARTY IS ACTUALLY THE

02:32:24.768 --> 02:32:29.540
SUSPECT. AND THAT IS AND I

02:32:29.607 --> 02:32:32.676
THINK WHY IN TRAINING MISSING

02:32:32.743 --> 02:32:34.912
PERSON TRAINING A LOT OF IT- IT

02:32:34.979 --> 02:32:37.915
GOOD FOCUSES. TO LOOK AT IT

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:38.849

PERSON WHEN THE REPORT IS MADE.

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:56.367
REFERENCING BACK A WELL

02:32:56.433 --> 02:32:57.768
PUBLICIZED CASE THAT WE'VE

02:32:57.835 --> 02:32:58.969
LEARNED A LOT FROM WAS THE

02:32:59.036 --> 02:33:01.906
SCOTT PETERSON CASE. AND LAW

02:33:01.972 --> 02:33:05.276
ENFORCEMENT. FOR PURPOSES OF

02:33:05.342 --> 02:33:07.444
EFFICIENCY AT SOME POINTS HAS

02:33:07.511 --> 02:33:09.847
GOTTEN TO WHERE- WILL TAKE A

02:33:15.553 --> 02:33:17.388
HAVING SOMEBODY THERE THAT

SHOWED UP TO TAKE THE MISSING

02:33:19.189 --> 02:33:21.358
PERSON REPORT WAS ABLE TO LOOK

02:33:21.425 --> 02:33:23.127
AROUND AND SEE SOME THINGS THAT

02:33:23.193 --> 02:33:24.495
WERE OUT OF PLACE IN THINGS

02:33:24.562 --> 02:33:25.629
THAT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN USED

02:33:25.696 --> 02:33:27.932
TO. CLEAN SOMETHING UP AND

02:33:27.998 --> 02:33:29.733
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE- YOU KNOW

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:30.568
THOSE THINGS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

02:33:30.634 --> 02:33:33.470
SEEN SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE

02:33:33.537 --> 02:33:34.672
SOMEBODY THERE WHETHER

THE RISK OF THESE REPEATED RUN

02:33:50.921 --> 02:33:53.724
AWAYS. AND ONE THING THAT YOU

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.826
KNOW WE STARTED. INITIALLY WHEN

02:33:55.893 --> 02:33:57.895
I WAS. RUNNING THE SYSTEM AN

02:33:57.962 --> 02:34:00.731
OUTGROWTH. IS THAT WE- IF THERE

MEETING THE CHECKLIST. I WOULD

02:34:54.151 --> 02:34:55.486

THE INVESTIGATIVE GENETIC

GENEALOGY PERSPECTIVE. SO THAT

IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT-

02:36:21.405 --> 02:36:23.373
WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND

IT NEEDS IT NEEDS TO BE

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:49.666
ENCOURAGE I THINK TRAINING

02:37:10.487 --> 02:37:11.488
OF DISCUSSION IN SAN DIEGO

RIGHT NOW- SEEM TO BE OUT THERE

02:37:20.430 --> 02:37:20.964
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF THE LACK

02:37:21.031 --> 02:37:23.367
