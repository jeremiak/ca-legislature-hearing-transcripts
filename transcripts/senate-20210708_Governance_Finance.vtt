00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.974
SOMETHING WE DO ALL EVERY DAY

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:39.809
AND FOR MANY OF US MANY TIMES

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:40.543
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.914
ABOUT IT IN THE BUILDING WE

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:47.884
AT OUR HOMES WE JUST GO. RIGHT

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:50.820
USING OUR RESTROOMS IT NOT ONLY

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:52.956
FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS BUT

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:54.891
FOR PARENTS WITH TODDLERS AND

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.826
CHILDREN WITH SENIORS BEING

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:58.895
ABLE TO GO OUT INTO A PUBLIC

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.998
PLACE AND COUNT ON A BATHROOM

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.167
THAT IS NOT ONLY OPEN BUT THAT

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:07.403
IS. USABLE AND CLEAN IS

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.905
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE SEEING

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.507
LESS AND LESS OF PARTICULARLY

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:14.744
DURING THIS PANDEMIC AS WE KNOW

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:19.082
RETAIL HAS BEEN LIMITED MANY

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:21.184
MANY TIMES WE SEE BATHROOMS ARE

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.419
ONLY FOR CUSTOMERS WE SEE OUR

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:26.289
FAST FOOD PLACES ARE THAT HAVE

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:30.326
BEEN CLOSED- AND SO AS WE THINK

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:33.196
ABOUT IT. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.597

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:36.733
ELSE'S SHOES AND CERTAINLY

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.901
AROUND THE CAPITAL ALL WE HAVE

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:41.571
TO DO IS LOOK AROUND AND SEE

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.139
THAT BECAUSE THIS BUILDING HAS

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.908

WITH NO PLACE TO USE A PUBLIC

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.652

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:59.856
THIS BILL. IS ORIGINATED OUT OF

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.125
THE IDEA THAT NOT JUST HOMELESS

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.499
BE ALLOWING PUBLIC RESTROOMS TO

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:11.567

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:40.693
RESOURCES OF HEALTH CARE. OF

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.395
THROUGH THIS THERE WILL BE A

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:44.296
ADVISORY COMMITTEE PUT IN PLACE

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.632
OF CITIZENS AND THE BOARD IS

MORE THAN WELCOME TO APPLY FOR

THAT POSITION OF AN ADVISORY.

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:51.904
BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT MORE

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:55.875
BEING DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF

02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.510
THIS COMMUNITY. FOR AND- THAT'S

02:01:57.576 --> 02:01:59.311
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN

02:01:59.378 --> 02:02:00.913
BROUGHT UP THAT- I KNOW THAT

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.682
THAT A LOT OF IT IS AT THE CORE

02:02:02.748 --> 02:02:05.418
OF THIS. IS THE ISSUE OF

02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:06.552
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:10.489
RESOLVED LOCALLY. OR OR BY THE

02:02:10.556 --> 02:02:13.959
STATE- AND SO I DO HAVE

02:02:14.026 --> 02:02:16.128
CONCERNS ABOUT BACK. IF YOU

02:02:16.195 --> 02:02:18.931
COULD. GET INTO THAT A LITTLE

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:21.067
BIT MORE BECAUSE- AGAIN THERE'S

02:02:21.133 --> 02:02:22.702
A SYSTEM THERE IS A SYSTEM

02:02:22.768 --> 02:02:25.304
THERE IS A PROCESS SET UP AND

02:02:25.371 --> 02:02:25.938
WE'RE BASICALLY BEING ASKED OF

02:02:26.005 --> 02:02:28.974
THE STATE. TO CHANGE THAT

02:02:29.041 --> 02:02:31.844
SYSTEM WHILE IT'S STILL IN IN

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:33.779
IN THAT LITIGATION PROCESS

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:35.281
RIGHT NOW AND AS I UNDERSTAND.

02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:37.616
AND IT IS AN APPEAL PROCESS

02:02:37.683 --> 02:02:41.320
NOW. WHAT MIGHT MIGHT. ABSOLUTE

02:02:41.387 --> 02:02:43.522
HOW I'M OFFENDED IS THAT

02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:45.591
THEY'RE USING MONEY TO DEFEND

02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:47.593
THIS PROCESS THAT SHOULD GO TO

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.663
THE PEOPLE. IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:52.431
AND THIS IS HUNDREDS OF

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:53.432
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:55.468
SPENT WHERE WE LOOK AT POST

02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:57.369
PANDEMIC WE NEED MENTAL

02:02:57.436 --> 02:02:59.472

EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS DISTRICT.

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:06.612
AND AS THIS PLAYS OUT AND TIME

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:08.781
AND TIME AND TIME THAT'S LESS

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:10.282
AND LESS MONEY THAT ARE GOING

02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:12.118
TO THE INTENDED RECIPIENTS FOR

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:13.886
HEALTHCARE. AND THAT'S MY WHOLE

02:03:13.953 --> 02:03:15.654
PURPOSE IS JUST TO MAKE SURE AT

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:17.022

THERE TO PROVIDE THIS AND WE

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:32.738
CAN MULTIPLY THE EFFECTIVENESS.

02:03:32.805 --> 02:03:34.607
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:35.608

IT ENTRENCHED INTO ENTITIES WHO

02:27:53.397 --> 02:27:54.999

ISSUE THAT HAS KIND OF BECAUSE

02:57:31.774 --> 02:57:33.075
THIS IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:57:33.142 --> 02:57:35.311
IRRIGATION DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE

02:57:35.378 --> 02:57:37.546
THAT PROVIDE ENERGY. THEY HAVE.

02:57:37.613 --> 02:57:39.915
OF GENERATORS AND- AND THEY

02:57:39.982 --> 02:57:43.519

INVOLVE OTHER PARTIES THERE'S A

02:57:46.122 --> 02:57:47.990
MUCH BETTER WAY TO DO THIS THEN

02:57:48.057 --> 02:57:51.127
IF YOU WILL PUT. THE PERSON WHO

02:57:51.193 --> 02:57:53.062

02:57:53.129 --> 02:57:56.232
WITHIN THAT CLOSE SESSION. WAY

02:57:56.298 --> 02:57:58.134
BACK IN THE MID EIGHTIES TO

02:57:58.200 --> 02:57:59.402
DEAL WITH SOMETHING FAR GREATER

02:57:59.468 --> 02:58:01.437
THAN THIS. THE WHOLE SACRAMENTO

02:58:01.504 --> 02:58:05.841
RIVER. I AUTHORED LEGISLATION

02:58:05.908 --> 02:58:06.942
CREATING WHAT BECAME THE

02:58:07.009 --> 02:58:10.212
SACRAMENTO RIVER CONSERVATION

02:58:10.279 --> 02:58:12.314
FOR. THAT WAS ALSO A PATTERN

02:58:12.381 --> 02:58:13.716
FOR WHAT BECAME CALVET DEALING

02:58:13.783 --> 02:58:16.152
WITH THE DEATH. BUT IT IS ALSO

02:58:16.218 --> 02:58:18.387
SIMILAR TO WHAT IMPERIAL COUNTY

02:58:18.454 --> 02:58:20.990
IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAS DONE TO

02:58:21.057 --> 02:58:22.958
DEAL WITH GIVING OTHER INPUT.

02:58:23.025 --> 02:58:24.727
ON THESE ISSUES THAT AFFECT

02:58:24.794 --> 02:58:26.862
OTHER AREAS SUCH AS RIVERSIDE

02:58:26.929 --> 02:58:31.734
COUNTY. THE GREAT SUCCESS OF

02:58:31.801 --> 02:58:32.835
THAT LEGISLATION THAT

02:58:32.902 --> 02:58:34.003
CONTRIBUTION FORM IS STILL

02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:37.206
AROUND. AND IN FACT THE SECTOR

02:58:37.273 --> 02:58:39.208
OF RESOURCES ACTUALLY CHAIRS

02:58:39.275 --> 02:58:40.943

02:58:41.010 --> 02:58:42.912
THE TIME. AND WHAT IS THAT

02:58:42.978 --> 02:58:44.180
ALLOWED YEARS AGO THE

02:58:44.246 --> 02:58:47.149

AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I

02:58:53.122 --> 02:58:54.457
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY HAVE A

02:58:54.523 --> 02:58:57.059
PROBLEM WITH. COMMUNICATING AND

02:58:57.126 --> 02:58:58.661
COORDINATING AND EXCHANGING

02:58:58.727 --> 02:59:01.197
INFORMATION. THAT KIND OF

02:59:01.263 --> 02:59:02.698
LEGISLATION WOULD BE A GOOD

02:59:02.765 --> 02:59:05.067
IDEA AND I WOULD SUGGEST AFTER

02:59:05.134 --> 02:59:07.136

WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST AS AN

02:59:12.441 --> 02:59:15.478

AREA THAT I REPRESENT. AND 60%

03:06:04.386 --> 03:06:07.089
OF THE BUSINESS. IS IN AN AREA

03:06:07.155 --> 03:06:08.724
WHERE THERE IS NO VOICE TO

03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:30.479
WHERE DOES IN RIVERSIDE CONTROL

03:06:30.546 --> 03:06:31.513
THEIR OWN DESTINY WHEN IT COMES

03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:33.382

03:06:33.448 --> 03:06:36.218
SHARED- POWER IN GOVERNANCE AT

03:06:36.285 --> 03:06:38.220
BETWEEN RIVERSIDE IN IMPERIAL

03:06:38.287 --> 03:06:39.955
COUNTY WHATEVER THAT MODEL MAY

03:06:40.022 --> 03:06:42.491

03:06:48.530 --> 03:06:50.632
IS WHY WE SEEN A SHIFT IN OUT

03:06:50.699 --> 03:06:53.535
WHERE THE POWER LOAD HENCE THE

03:06:53.602 --> 03:06:55.804
CONSTITUENTS ARE LOCATED. BUT

03:06:55.871 --> 03:06:57.873
THERE THERE ARE VERY FEW AREAS

03:06:57.940 --> 03:07:00.142
IN THE STATE. WHERE THERE IS

03:07:00.208 --> 03:07:01.343
SUCH A GAP WHEN IT COMES TO

03:07:01.410 --> 03:07:02.678
REPRESENTATION JUST BEING

03:07:02.744 --> 03:07:04.680
CANDID ABOUT IT. NOT TRYING TO

03:07:04.746 --> 03:07:06.548
THROW STONES BUT SIMPLY SAYING

03:07:06.615 --> 03:07:08.550
WE HAVE TO FIX IT- AND KNOW
