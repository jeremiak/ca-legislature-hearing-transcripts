COMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE YOUR
TIME TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE

THE DISCUSSION AND GETTING
GETTING YOUR IN THE COMMITTEES

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:04.408
FEEDBACK ON THE PROPOSAL THAT'S
IN FRONT OF YOU -- YOU KNOW I

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:07.578
THINK THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS
DOES A NICE JOB SHOWING HOW

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:10.547
SMALL DOLLAR LENDING OVER
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HIS HAS

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:13.417
DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE
STATE THE REASONS WHY IN THOSE

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:18.122
ARE LEGITIMATE REASONS -- IF
VARIOUS FORMS OF OF GOVERNMENT

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:21.492
ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS
RENT MORATORIUMS ALL OF THOSE

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:25.729
THINGS HAD HAVE LED TO THAT
DECLINE BUT AS THE AS THE

00:44:25.796 --> 00:44:29.633
ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT WE
KNOW THAT FOR BETTER OR WORSE

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.770
A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE
COMING TO AN END AS AS THE

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:36.573
AUTHOR JUST NOTED -- WE'RE
SEEING IN POLLING WE'RE SEEING

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.811
AND OTHER -- OTHER AVENUES
CALIFORNIANS ARE BECOMING

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:44.048
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT
THEIR FINANCIAL WELL BEING HERE

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:48.152
IN THE STATE AND AND WHAT THAT
LOOKS LIKE MOVING FORWARD OUR

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:52.589
VIEW IS THAT IT SHOULD BE THE
PUBLIC POLICY OF THE STATE OF

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:57.294
CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE A SAFE
REGULATED PLACE FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:01.265
NEED MONEY CAN'T GO TO BANKS
CAN'T GO TO CREDIT UNIONS TO

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:05.969
GET THOSE FUNDS AND AND WE WE
THINK YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH THERE

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:10.574
IS THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT ENTITY
OUT THERE THAT COLLECTS DATA ON

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:13.877
WHAT THE NEED IS WE THINK THERE
ARE SOME INDICATORS OUT THERE

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:20.117
IN THE MARKET PLACE FOR EXAMPLE
-- YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT TWENTY

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:23.620
TWENTY PAYDAY LOANS HERE IN THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SIX POINT

00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:27.324
ONE MILLION PAYDAY LOANS AROUND
ONE POINT SIX EIGHT BILLION

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:32.629
DOLLARS LENT AS THE COMMITTEE
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT UNDER --

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.867
PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF AB
FIVE THIRTY NINE LOANS FROM

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:40.003
THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR
TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:44.541
SPACE BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF
THAT BILL BE OF SEVEN HUNDRED

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:48.312
AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND LOANS
EVERY YEAR AROUND THREE BILLION

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:52.483
DOLLARS LENT THOSE LOANS ARE
NOT NO LONGER AVAILABLE OUT IN

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:56.487
THE MARKET PLACE WHERE TO THOSE
FOLKS GO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A

00:45:56.553 --> 00:46:01.258
PLACE TO GO WE KNOW THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO THE PILOT PROGRAM

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:04.394
DATA ON THE PILOT PROGRAM SHOWS
THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONLY

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:08.232
NINETY FIVE THOUSAND LOANS
WERE MADE THROUGH THE PILOT

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:11.635
PROGRAM THE BULK OF THOSE IN
THE FIVE HUNDRED TO FIFTEEN

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:15.139
HUNDRED DOLLARS SPACE ONLY
AROUND NINETY FOUR MILLION

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:19.109
DOLLARS LAND VIA THE PILOT
PROGRAM WE THINK ONE OF THE

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:23.547
REASONS WHY THOSE NUMBERS ARE
SO LOW IS BECAUSE AS AS THE

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:27.084
AUTHOR POINTED OUT YOU REALLY
ONLY HAVE ONE MAJOR LEFT

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:30.621
ONE MAJOR LENDER LEFT IN THE
PROGRAM THERE USED TO BE TWO

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:34.258
AND UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE
PANDEMIC ONE OF THOSE ENTITIES

00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:38.729
WENT BANKRUPT SO YOU'VE GOT
ONE MAJOR LENDER LAUGHED YOU'VE

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:43.367
GOT SEVENTEEN SMALL LENDERS
AND YOU'VE GOT SIXTY PERCENT OF

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:46.904
THE PEOPLE WHO APPLY FOR LOANS
UNDER THAT PROGRAM ARE DENIED

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:51.875
A LOAN THESE FOLKS DON'T STOP
LOOKING FOR MONEY THEY JUST

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:56.313
GO TO OTHER PLACES TO GET IT
AND WE CAN ASSUME THAT A SMALL

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.783
PERCENTAGE OF THEM DO STOP
LOOKING FOR MONEY BUT THE THE

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.986
VAST MAJORITY OF THEM DON'T
THEY JUST GO TO OTHER PLACES TO

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:08.959
GET IT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF OF

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:13.163
THE AUTHORS BILL IS BECAUSE WE
KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S PREVIOUS

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:18.402
PILOT PROGRAMS DIED BECAUSE OF
LACK OF LENDERS FROM D.

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:18.602
F.

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:19.703
P.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:23.273
EYES YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY
REPORT ON THIS PILOT PROGRAM

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.076
THEY NOTED THAT IN TWENTY TEN
THE AFFORDABLE CREDIT BUILDING

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:29.613
OPPORTUNITIES PILOT PROGRAM
WAS IN EFFECT HELLO LENDER

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.151
PARTICIPATION RATE LED TO THE
PROGRAM'S DEMISE LEADING TO A

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:38.956
TO BE REPLACED BY THIS PILOT
PROGRAM IN TWENTY THIRTEEN

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:41.491
WE ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF
THAT AGAIN WE'VE GOT ONE

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:46.096
MAJOR LENDER LEFT AND SO HOW
DO YOU GET MORE LENDERS INTO

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:50.133
THIS PROGRAM SO THAT MORE
CALIFORNIANS KNOW ABOUT IT THE

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.737
AVAILABILITY OF THE PROGRAM
AND CAN ACCESS THESE FUNDS

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:59.042
WHEN THEY NEED IT INSTEAD
OF GOING TO AT A A.

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:00.110
N.

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:03.447
LENDING ENERGY OFFSHORE NOT
REGULATED BY THE STATE OF

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:08.352
CALIFORNIA SO AB TWENTY EIGHT
THIRTY NINE DOESN'T TOUCH

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:12.489
THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OF
THE UNDERLYING PROGRAM IT

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:17.160
DOESN'T TOUCH THE SUNSET DATE
OF THE PROGRAM IT HAS TWO

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:21.331
MAIN COMPONENTS TO IT AND THE
FIRST IS REQUIRING D.

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:21.531

TO POST ON THE INTERNET THE
LIST OF OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION

00:48:27.337 --> 00:48:31.041
PROVIDERS THAT A LENDER COULD
UTILIZE WHICH HERE IN A SECOND

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:33.477
MISTER GWALTNEY IS GOING TO GET
INTO WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IN

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:36.847

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:36.960
THROUGH THERE ARE LOCATIONS
BANKRUPT IT UNFORTUNATELY SHOWS

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:39.095
THAT THERE ARE EXPENSES THAT
HAVE TO BE COVERED IN ORDER

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:42.299
TO OFFER THIS KIND OF CREDIT

THEY'RE NOT AVAILING THEMSELVES
OF LICENSED REGULATED AND

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:52.609
AUDITED CALIFORNIA COMPANIES SO
SOME OF THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:55.745
WITH THE TWO PROPOSALS WITHIN
-- THIS BILL IS THAT THE

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:59.983
FIRST ONE IT ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS
SMALL IS HAVING THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.787
NOTATE ON THEIR WEBSITE WHAT
IS THE AVAILABLE EDUCATION

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:07.023
PROGRAM THAT IS REQUIRED IS
A CONSUMER PROTECTION UNDER

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.693
THE PILOT RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE
A LICE IF YOUR LENDER WHO

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:12.095
WANTS TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS
YOU HAVE TO COULD YOU HAVE TO

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:14.831
FORMALLY GROUND TAKE IT TO THE
REGULATOR AND THEN ASK THEM TO

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:18.502
BLESSED AS OPPOSED TO THAT'S
ALREADY BEEN DONE SO WE WOULD

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:21.872
WE FIND IT REALLY HELPFUL
AND IT REDUCES THE UP FRONT

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:25.609
-- BERRY TO ENTRY COSTS THAT
LENDERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO GET

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:28.211
INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM THEY
CAN JUST GO AHEAD THIS IS A

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.013
PROGRAM THAT'S ALREADY BEEN
PRE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.250
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND MONEY
TO TRY TO FORMULATE A NEW ONCE

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:37.254
THE SECOND PROPOSAL -- ALLOWING
A MODEST MONTHLY MAINTENANCE

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.257
FEE RECOGNIZES AND I REALLY
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S TIMES

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:43.493
LOOKING AT THIS THAT THEIR
ONGOING EXPENSES THAT OCCUR

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.364

LENDING THAT TARGETS THE
MOST ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:09.526
CONSUMERS WITH THAT WE ARE VERY
CONCERNED WITH THE PROPOSED

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:13.363
CHANGES TO THE SMALL DOLLAR
LOAN PILOT PROGRAM THIS BILL

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:16.032
WOULD UNDERMINE ALL THE WORK
WE HAVE DONE TO KEEP LENDERS

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:19.569
FROM STRIPPING WEALTH FROM
OUR COMMUNITIES THE PROPOSED

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:22.438
MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE OF
FORTY DOLLARS ON LOANS FROM

00:57:22.505 --> 00:57:24.774
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWENTY
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS NOTHING

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:28.278
SHORT OF ABUSIVE THIS BILL
WOULD ALLOW LENDERS TO CHARGE

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:31.514
THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO HUNDRED
PERCENT APR ON A FIVE HUNDRED

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:35.185
DOLLAR LOAN AND SEVENTY ONE
PERCENT APR ON A TWENTY FIVE

00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:38.688
HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN THE FBI
DATA SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:41.424
OF PILOT LOANS MADE ARE TO
PEOPLE BUT MAKING BETWEEN

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:44.961
TWENTY THOUSAND TO FORTY FIVE
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THESE

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.430
CONSUMERS IN PARTICULAR SHOULD
NOT BE THOUGHT OF HIGH COST

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:50.233
DEBT WHEN SEEKING LOANS THAT
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BENEFICIAL

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:54.237
ALTERNATIVES TO PREDATORY

OF WHAT THIS NEW BILL PROPOSES
THEREFORE AB TWENTY EIGHT

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:17.627
THIRTY NINE WOULD MOVE US IN
THE WRONG DIRECTION AND PROVIDE

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:21.531
A LOOPHOLE FOR LENDERS TO

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:58.434
OPPOSITION CALIFORNIA HAS
MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN

00:58:58.501 --> 00:59:00.937
ADDRESSING THE NUMEROUS WAYS
CONSUMERS FACE PREDATORY

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:04.440
FINANCIAL PRACTICES AND PRIOR
TO PASSING THE RATE CAP IN

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:07.744
TWENTY NINETEEN TRIPLE DIGIT
INTEREST LOANS WERE WREAKING

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:10.313
HAVOC IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND
DRIVING CALIFORNIANS INTO

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.750
SIGNIFICANT CYCLES OF DEBT AB
TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE IS A

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:16.619
STEP BACKWARDS I WOULD OPEN THE
DOOR TO THIS TYPE OF LENDING

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:19.789
ALL OVER AGAIN INDUSTRY KEEPS
TRYING TO CLAIM THAT THIS

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.492
TYPE OF LENDING HELPS CREATE
ACCESS TO CREDIT AND THAT THIS

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:25.528
IS JUST UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF
THE PILOT PROGRAM HOWEVER AS

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:29.532
ADVOCATES ON THE GROUND WE KNOW
BETTER TO ADD FEES TO A LOAN

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:32.235
THAT IS ALREADY INTENDED FOR
FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED PERSON

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:35.371
IS FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE
IF THE CONSUMER NEEDS ALONE

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:38.374
IN THE FIRST PLACE ADDING
MORE COSTS FIFTEEN THE LOAN

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:41.744
IS SIMPLY ILLOGICAL TWENTY
TWO PERCENT OF LOANS MADE

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.480
UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM WHERE
DELINQUENT FOR SEVEN TO TWENTY

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:48.084
NINE DAYS ADDING COSTS THESE
LOANS THROUGH A MAINTENANCE FEE

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:51.321
OR BY RAISING INTEREST RATES
ALLOWED TO BE CHARGED WILL ONLY

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:55.892
MAKE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT
GREATER FOR THESE BORROWERS

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:58.828
NO ONE IS DOING ANY FAVORS BY
OFFERING A PREDATORY SERVICE

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:01.965
TO FILL A GAP THAT HAS BEEN
MADE BY LARGER SYSTEMIC ISSUES

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.968
THE VERY SAME SYSTEM THAT IS
BECOMES THAT BECOMES OVERBURDEN

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:08.137
WHEN IMPACTED CONSUMERS SIMPLY
CANNOT AFFORD TO TREAD WATER

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:11.975
ANY LONGER IN THE WAKE OF COBIT
AND THE ECONOMIC PRESSURES IT

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:15.712
HAS CREATED FOR MANY FAMILIES
IS NOT THE TIME TO SCALE BACK

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.114
OUR INNOVATIONS HAVE WORKED
WITH MANY OF YOU TO MAKE SURE

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:20.917
THAT CALIFORNIANS WITH THE
LEAST AMOUNT OF RESOURCES OF

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:24.354
ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE
PRODUCTS ALLOWING THESE RATES

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.457
TO COME BACK IS TAKING US IN
THE WRONG DIRECTION SO WHILE

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:29.859
THERE IS NOT A VOTE ON THIS
MEASURE TODAY WE DO EMPLOYER

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.762
TO STAY THE COURSE AND CONTINUE
SENDING THE MESSAGES THE

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:35.999
MESSAGE THAT BUSINESS ENTITIES
THAT MAKE THEIR PROFITS OFF THE

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:39.035
VULNERABILITIES OF DISTRESSED
CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE A PLACE

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:42.038

I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:50.620
-- FOR -- OR RECOGNIZE -- THE
AUTHOR FOR YOUR INTENTIONS AND

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:56.459
WANTING TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SO -- FOR

01:04:56.525 --> 01:05:02.298
THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE WELL
NOTED AND -- I I I I ALSO THINK

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:08.271
THAT -- SINCE AB FIVE THIRTY
NINE WHICH DID ADDRESS THE LOAN

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:12.241
-- SPECTRUM FROM TWENTY FIVE
HUNDRED UP TO I BELIEVE IT WAS

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:17.113
TEN THOUSAND -- AND WHAT YOUR
TRYING TO ADDRESS IS ACTUALLY

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.182
BETWEEN THE THREE HUNDRED
AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MARK

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:25.588
IS THAT CORRECT ALL RIGHT SO
SO WITH THAT I THINK THERE'S

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:29.625
A VACUUM OF OF DATA WE WERE
MISSING A LOT AND A LOT OF

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:34.430
DATA AND THE QUESTION WAS
POSED BY PROPONENTS -- WHERE

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:37.233
DID THOSE PEOPLE GO BUT THAT
WAS ACTUALLY FOR FIVE THIRTY

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:43.706
NINE WHICH IS NOT YOURS SPACE
FOR THIS BILL THIS SPACE HAS

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:48.644
BEEN THE SAME SENSE HOWEVER
WAS NOTED THAT THERE WERE SOME

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:52.648
-- A PILOT PROGRAMS THAT DID
FAIL AND WE'RE DOWN TO ONE

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:58.554
LEFT SO WITH THAT -- I WOULD
LIKE TO HEAR IF IF EITHER SIDE

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:02.958
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN
-- INFORMATION AND AND BE

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:08.164
ABLE TO FIND DATA TO SHOW WHAT
HAS HAPPENED SINCE AB FIVE

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:12.601
THIRTY NINE -- ESSENCE THAT
WENT INTO LAW AND -- I I ALSO

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:16.272
WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE ARE
EXCITED ABOUT THE FBI AND THE

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:20.142
NEW RESEARCH ARM THAT IS BEING
BUILT THERE THAT I BELIEVE

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:24.046
WOULD BE OF VERY INTEGRAL TO
BEING ABLE TO GET THE DATA THAT

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:27.216
I'M ASKING FOR HOWEVER HAVE
YOU ALL BEEN ABLE TO FIND DATA

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:32.822
ON YOUR OWN MISTER CHAIRMAN
BOB SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE DE

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:36.759
APENAS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO GET
DATA FOR THIS PARTICULAR SPACE

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.261
UNFORTUNATELY THROUGH THE YEARS
HAS NOT BEEN A REPORT THAT

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:43.566
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES IT FROM
THE REGULATOR WHAT I CAN DO IS

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:47.203
EXPRESS -- SOME DATA THAT WE
DO HAVE IN IT ALTHOUGH SOME OF

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:50.206
IT IS ANECDOTAL BECAUSE THERE'S
NOT A FORMALIZED STUDY FROM OUR

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:55.511
REGULATOR ON IT IT'S THERE IS
WHEN CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS GO

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:58.381
ON THE INTERNET AND THE ATTEMPT
TO FIND A LOAN WHICH IS USUALLY

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:01.217
LIKE ALL OF US WEEKLY GOOGLE
SOMETHING SO WHEN YOU GOOGLE

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:04.754
YOU'RE GONNA FIND MILLIONS OF
HITS WHEN YOU GOOGLE CALIFORNIA

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.892
PERSONAL LOANS FOR CALIFORNIA
INSTALLMENT LOANS THE THERE

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.528
ARE COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT
CONSOLIDATE THIS DATA AND

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:17.967
PROVIDE LEADS TO COMPANIES THAT
ARE LOOKING TO LEND TO THESE

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:22.338
CONSUMERS WHAT WE'VE SOUGHT
FROM THIS SET OF DOUBT IS IN

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:26.175
TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS OVER
SIXTEEN MILLION REQUESTS FOR

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:30.780
LOANS THAT WERE DONE ONLINE
AND OF THAT ONLY ONE POINT

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:34.150
FOUR PERCENT OF THEM WENT TO
CALIFORNIA LICENSE LENDERS

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.519
SO WHAT DOES THAT SPEAK UP
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE EXACT

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:39.588
OUT OF THAT THEY WENT TO THESE
PARTICULAR LENDERS BUT WAIT A

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:42.591
MINUTE WE HAVE ALMOST NINETY
EIGHT MORE THAN NINETY EIGHT

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:45.961
PERCENT ARE NOT LENDING A ARE
NOT LANDING AT LICENSE LENDERS

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:48.297
IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN SOME AND
IT'S NOT THAT NINETY PERCENT

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:51.934
DIDN'T GET LOANS SO LOGIC TELLS
US THAT THEY'RE GETTING LOANS

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:56.172
ARE JUST NOT GETTING LOANS THAT
ARE REGULATED BY THE DAPI AND

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.774
THANK YOU FOR THAT I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE DISTURBANCE WE WILL

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:03.946
HEAR ALSO -- FROM FROM YOU AS
FAR AS DATA I AM GOING TO HAND

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:08.417
CHAIR -- THE GAVEL OVER TO MR
STONE I HAVE TO GO PRESENT AND

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:13.088
REVAN TAX THE BILL WERE THEY'RE
GONNA CLOSED MEETING WITHOUT

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:16.392
HEARING FROM ME MR STONE IF
YOU WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO TAKE

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:21.230
OVER PERFECT SO I WILL ADD AND
AGAIN MY NAME IS LUCY A MATIC'S

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:24.400
WITH ANTIPERSPIRANTS BLENDING
ALL ADD THAT AB FIVE THIRTY

01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:28.571
NINE WENT TO EFFECT IN TWENTY
TWENTY AND SHORTLY IF YOU MEANT

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:31.507
THREE MONTHS INTO THE YEAR THE
PANDEMIC HIT RIGHT AND SO WE

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:34.810
SAW LENDING DOWN ACROSS THE
BOARD NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.813
BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY AND
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.948
THAT WE LET THE D.

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:42.985
FBI GAME A LITTLE BIT MORE
TIME TO COLLECT MORE DATA BUT

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:46.889
ALSO WE SAW THAT CONSUMERS
WERE ABLE TO ACCESS LOANS THAT

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:50.493
THE BUY NOW PAY LATER PRODUCTS
FOR EXAMPLE MADE UP FOR NINETY

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:53.796
ONE PERCENT OF NON BANK LOANS
DURING THAT TIME AND TWENTY

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:56.398
TWENTY WHEN THE LAST DATA THE
LAST YEAR WE HAVE DATA FROM

01:08:56.465 --> 01:09:00.169
THE FBI SO FOLKS WERE ACT AND
THOSE LENDERS ARE LICENSE IN

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:03.539
CALIFORNIA SO THE IDEA THAT
FOLKS WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:06.809
ANY LOANS IS NOT TRUE IN OUR
IN OUR OPINION WHAT WE'VE

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:09.879
BEEN SPLIT WE'VE BEEN SEEING
IN THE DATA AND WE HAVEN'T

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:12.748
HAD ENOUGH TIME SINCE EIGHTY
FIVE THIRTY NINE HAS BEEN IN

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:16.252
EFFECT TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACTS
ARE ON THE GROUND SO IN ORDER

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:19.622
TO DO THAT WE NEED SOME MORE
TIME AWAY FROM THIS IRREGULAR

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:22.157
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN DUE
TO THE PANDEMIC TO SEE HOW

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:26.128
THESE LOANS BEAR OUT AND HOW
THESE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:31.200
I THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER
QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISS WILSON

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:37.840
THANK YOU TO DR AND MRS HELPS
THE LEARNING I'M THANK YOU

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:40.676
TO THE AUTHOR AND OF THIS IS
THAT REALLY IMPORTANT -- THE

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:44.547
PILOT PROGRAM IS VERY MUCH
NECESSARY -- AND ACCESS TO

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.716
CAPITAL IS IS GOOD ESPECIALLY
FOR THOSE WITH LOW CREDIT

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:51.587
ARMS ARE LOWER CREDIT SCORES
OR NO CREDIT SCORES AT ALL

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:54.290
-- ONE CONCERN THAT CAME UP
WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO THE

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:57.259
TESTIMONY TO EACH FOR THE BOTH
PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF

01:09:57.326 --> 01:10:01.063
IT AND WONDER IF IT COULD BE
CLARIFIED IT WAS NOTED -- IN

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:03.899
THE PROPONENT THAT -- IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT IT'S SAFE AND

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:07.536
REGULATED AND IT WAS NOTED IN
THE OPPONENT THAT IT SHOULD BE

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:13.042
SAFE AND AFFORDABLE SO COULD
YOU EXPLAIN THE TWO DIFFERENT

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:15.945
WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU IN TERMS
OF SAFE AND REGULATED VERSUS

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:19.014
SAFE AFFORDABLE OR ONE OF THE

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.218
IF YOU DON'T MIND I CAN GO
AHEAD AND FILL THAT ONE SO

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:26.589
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BALANCE
THE PILOT PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:29.224
YOU KNOW FOR OVER TEN YEARS
AND THERE'S GREAT CONSUMER

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:31.827
PROTECTIONS IN IT AND THE
LENDERS THAT ARE LOOKING TO

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.096
LONDON OR WANT THOSE CONSUMER
PROTECTIONS THEY WANT TO BE

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:38.968
ABLE TO TO CONTINUE TO OFFER
THAT SO THIS IS THIS IS THE

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:43.872
BALANCE HOW DO YOU ATTRACT
MORE LENDERS AND IN RIGHT

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.609
NOW IT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE LENDER

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:49.845
AND IT ISN'T IT'S NOT FOR THE
LAST YEAR THIS IS BEEN GOING

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:53.482
ON FOR YEARS AND THE ONE AND
WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:56.185
FIRST LENDER TOOK HIM SEVEN
YEARS TO GET PROFITABLE SO

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:58.821
YOU'RE GONNA ATTRACT ANOTHER
LIKE YOU KNOW OTHER LENDERS WE

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:01.857
DO HAVE TO FIND THAT BALANCE
YOU'RE RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:05.794
SURE IT'S SAFE FOR THE CONSUMER
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS BUT IF

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:10.633
THE LENDER CANNOT LAND AND
COVER THE EXPENSES YOU'RE JUST

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:12.201
NOT GONNA HAVE ANY LENDING
AND THAT'S WHAT'S CURRENTLY

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:17.373
HAPPENING SO THAT IS THAT IS
THE BALANCE WE HAVE TO FIND A

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:20.843
WAY TO COVER EXPENSES FOR THE
LENDER AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:23.979
BILL IS DOING THAT OTHER STATES
HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:28.250
ON GOING MONTHLY EXPENSES AND
WE AND IT'S RECOGNIZING THAT

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:31.620
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO
HELP ATTRACT NEW LENDERS THAT

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:36.725
ARE WILLING TO BE LICENSED AND
REGULATED AND AUDITED I THINK

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.194
THE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION
I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE OTHER

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:41.630
STATES POINTED TO THE ARE
ALSO LEARNING FOR TRIPLE DIGIT

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:44.233
INTEREST RATES AND THAT'S GOING
AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE PIECE

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:47.770
THAT YOU JEFF REYES AT THAT
POINT SO THERE'S A BALANCE I

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:51.140
AGREE BUT MOVE IN THE DIRECTION
OF CHARGING FORTY DOLLARS PER

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:54.543
MONTH ON ITS SURFACE REGARDLESS
OF THE SIZE OF THE LOAN YOU'RE

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.912
LOOKING AT CHARGING SOMEONE
ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:11:56.979 --> 01:12:00.949
A YEAR AT THE FORTY DOLLARS A
MONTH -- THAT COST THERE AND

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.919
SO THERE ARE OTHER SOLUTIONS WE
CAN EXPLORE BUT TACKING ON THAT

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:06.955
COST OF BOOKS AS I MENTIONED
BEFORE WE'RE MAKING AT MOST

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:09.224
FORTY FIVE FOR THE MAJORITY OF
THESE CONSUMERS ON THIS PROGRAM

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:12.428
AGAIN UNDER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND
DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S THE WRONG

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:16.065
SOLUTION AND WRONG CALCULUS
BECAUSE THE EMPHASIS IS BEING

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:19.201
PLACED ON ON ON LENDERS AND HOW
THEY CAN BECOME PROFITABLE AS

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:21.970
OPPOSED TO CONSUMERS AND HOW
THEY CAN REALLY GET ACCESS TO

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:24.540
THOSE STATE LOANS BECAUSE AS
I MENTIONED BEFORE THEY ARE

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:28.944
ACCESSING LOANS AND THE FINAL
ACCESS TO CREDIT -- AND SO IF

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.946
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS
PROGRAM IS STRONGER I THINK

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.882
THERE'S ANOTHER CALCULUS THAT
WE CAN COME TO AND WE NEED

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:38.721
SOME MORE TIME TO COLLECT THAT
DATA AND NOW TO THE CHAIR HOW

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:42.758
HOW DOES THE IT SAYS NOT TO
EXCEED FORTY DOLLARS ON THE

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.260
MAX AMOUNT AND I THOUGHT I
HEARD DURING THE TESTIMONY

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:48.997
THAT THERE POTENTIALLY COULD
BE A TIERED SYSTEM AS OTHER

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:52.201
STATES MAY DO AND SO A LOT OF
TIMES AND YOU SEE A MAXIMUM IT

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:56.038
USUALLY MEANS THAT FEMALE RATE
AND THEN IT ALSO HAS THE JUST

01:12:56.105 --> 01:13:00.642
FORMULATION SO IT SEEMS LIKE
IF IF IT'S SET INTO -- AND IF

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:03.812
IT'S IF IT'S WRITTEN THIS WAY
AND THERE'S NO CAP EVEN ON THAT

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:06.715
YOU COULD EVENTUALLY GET TO
WHERE IT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:09.985
AND JUST ON THE EXAMPLE HERE
IT HAS THE TRIPLE DIGITS WHICH

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:12.254
IS UP THE WHOLE POINT OF THE
PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WAS TO

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.923
AVOID THAT YOU COULD COULD
YOU TELL TALK TO ME A LITTLE

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:19.294
BIT ABOUT THE HOW THE -- THE
MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE WORKS

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:25.534
IS EXPECTED TO BE FORTY DOLLARS
PER -- LOAN AND IS IT EXPECTED

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:29.404
-- AND I DON'T SEE IT HAPPEN
HERE BECAUSE THERE IS -- IN

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:33.041
TERMS OF HOW HIGH IT CAN GO IN
TERMS OF THE ANNUAL INFLATION

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:37.079
EACH YEAR UNDERSTOOD AND ONE
THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:40.015
CLARIFY BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT
GETS LOST THE INTEREST RATE

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.118
IS NOT A TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST
RATE THE INTEREST RATE IS

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:46.321
NOT CHANGING UNDER THIS BILL
THERE'S A SET INTEREST RATES

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.357
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE TOTAL COSTS ALONE IN THE

01:13:48.423 --> 01:13:50.959
ACTUAL INTEREST RATE IS ONE
MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE --

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:53.762
RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S IT'S THAT
THE MAXIMUM UNDER THE PILOT AT

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:56.732
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT IS THIRTY
SIX PERCENT ALTHOUGH THERE IS

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:59.835
ADDITION THIS MONTH THE MONTHLY
MAINTENANCE FEE DOES INTRODUCE

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:03.839
ANOTHER COST SO WHEN YOU DO AN
APR -- IT DOES SHOW THE NUMBERS

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:06.375
THAT WE SAW IN THE ANALYSIS
I THINK WHAT IS HELPFUL AS

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.277
I THINK THE ANALYSIS DID A
REALLY GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:11.814
SOMETIMES IT IS NOT THE BEST
INDICATOR OF THE COSTA CREDIT

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.449
BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE LOANS
ARE NOT OUT FOR YEARS YOU KNOW

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:20.422
OVER A YEAR OR TWO SO I THINK
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE V.

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:24.493
THIS BILL IS A STARTING POINT
INTRODUCING A TYPE OF STRUCTURE

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.564
THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE LENDERS
I MEAN I THINK US AS THE A

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.266
COMMUNITY OF LENDERS THAT WOULD
LIKE TO LENDER THIS WE'VE BEEN

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:34.203
TRYING WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR
OVER WITH THE PILOT PROGRAMS

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.572
OVER ELEVEN TEN ELEVEN YEARS
TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.408
THAT DOES WORK WE'RE WE'RE
OPEN AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:42.978
PROGRAM AND INTRODUCING A A
A RECOGNITION THAT THERE'S

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:46.515
ONGOING EXPENSES ON A MONTHLY
BASIS TO THE LENDER IN ORDER TO

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:51.620
HAVE THE BAR ACCESS THIS CREDIT
BOB WE RESPECT THAT M.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:54.323
AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEY
THE AUTHORS DONE A GOOD JOB

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:57.726
SHOWING THAT HEY THIS ISN'T
EXPECTED EXPENSE IS IT FORTY

01:14:57.793 --> 01:15:01.029
IS GONNA BE LESS THAN THAT THE
WORLD INTO THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:04.566
BOB WE'RE OPEN TO OTHER
SOLUTIONS WE WOULD ASK YOU KNOW

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:07.603
THOSE THAT MAY BE IN OPPOSITION
YOU KNOW THERE'S USUALLY A LOT

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.872
OF TALK ABOUT WHY THIS ISN'T
WORKING BUT WE DON'T HEAR A

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:14.509
LOT OF SUGGESTIONS BY HER PAID
BY NOW PAY LATER WE SAW A HUGE

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:18.447
INCREASE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT
THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:21.216
THE REASONS THAT THE REGULATOR
STATED IN THE END REPORTS AS TO

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:24.086
WHY PEOPLE TAKE A PILOT PROGRAM
LOANS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:27.055
TO BUY GOODS YOU KNOW THERE'S
EMERGENCIES AT THEIR EXPERIENCE

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.924
AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING ABOUT
THE QUEST THE QUESTION WAS

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:32.127
SPECIFIC TO THE THAT THE FORTY
DOLLARS FORTY DOLLARS YEAH AND

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:35.631
THEN IT SO EIGHT NINE OR DO YOU
YOU ECHOED -- SOMETHING THAT

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:38.667
WAS SAID EARLIER IN TERMS OF
NOT SURE FORTY DOLLARS IS THE

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:42.371
RIGHT NUMBER WHICH IN MY MIND
FLAGS IT'S ARBITRARY AND SO

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:45.908
I WAS VERY BEEN ANY ANY DATA
GIVEN AT ALL AND MAYBE NOT

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:49.077
HERE BUT DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE
THAT SAYS IT USUALLY COSTS THIS

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:52.981
MUCH TO MAINTAIN A SMALL DOLLAR
LOAN BETWEEN THAT FIVE HUNDRED

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.550
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS
A COST BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYEES

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:58.220
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS IS
THAT DATA THIS IS THE SOFTWARE

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.389
THAT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE YOU
KNOW THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:04.526
WAS THERE DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA
THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE WHITE

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:08.330
FORTY DOLLARS AMOUNT OR IS IT
UNDER SO IT'S IT'S NOT EXACTLY

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:11.400
IT'S IT'S NOT ARBITRARY IN
THAT THERE WERE IN THE THERE

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.902
WAS LOOK YOU LOOK AT OTHER
STATES AND WHAT OTHER STATES

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.505
HAVE DONE AND AS WE MENTIONED
I BELIEVE THAT MR MOFFETT'S

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:18.140
TESTAMENT HE MENTIONED THAT
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:21.410
STATES THAT HAVE PASSED THIS
CONCEPT ONE OF THEM WAS OHIO

01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:23.745
AND WE LOOK AT OHIO AND LOOKED
AT WHAT THEY WERE DOING I

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:28.350
BELIEVE THAT THAT AMOUNT WE
SAID IT THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.786
BECAUSE OF HIGH BECAUSE COSTING
CALIFORNIA THIRTY PERCENT

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:33.689
HIGHER THAN OPERATING IN THE
STATE OF OHIO AND SO THAT'S

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:37.759
WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM BOB
IT RECOGNIZES THAT THE -- THAT

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:40.829
STATE DID SOME MATH CALIFORNIA
WE RECOGNIZE THE COST OF

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:44.299
DOING BUSINESS HERE IS HIGHER
SO THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.735
IF I HEARD CORRECTLY THERE'S
NO YET JUSTIFICATION FOR THE

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:49.938
AMOUNT OF FORTY DOLLARS EXCEPT
SETTING IT AT A RATE AGAINST

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:53.075
OHIO OF THIRTY PERCENT IN
ADVANCE THAT WAS ONE WAY TO

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:56.311
GET TO THIS NUMBER -- AT THIS
POINT AND I'M NOT PREPARED TO

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:59.815
GIVE YOU AN ACTUAL BREAKDOWN
I DATED KHLOE DOLLARS RIGHT

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.517
HEARING CORRECTLY ON THAT OKAY

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:08.423
THANK YOU AND IT'S NOTED THAT
OHIO HAS A VERY DIFFERENT

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.193
PROGRAM INCLUDING IN LOWER
INTEREST RATES SO WHEN WE'RE

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:13.929
TALKING ABOUT THE FORTY DOLLARS
A MONTH OR OR MONTHLY FEE

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:18.400
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND YES
WE'VE CAP SHE SO THAT A MEMBER

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.836
THIS COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:22.804
AND THROUGH THIS AND THROUGH
THE SENATE TOOK A NUMBER OF

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:26.808
YEARS TO GET TO A POINT WHERE
WE COULD GET ENOUGH CONTROL

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:30.278
OVER INTEREST RATES AND AND
TRY AND PROTECT CONSUMERS IN

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:36.084
THIS SPACE TO THE TO THE EXTENT
THAT WE HAVE SO IT'S I GUESS

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:40.088
SOME FOR ME A LITTLE SKEPTICAL
ABOUT THIS STEP RIGHT NOW

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.825
ESPECIALLY WITH THAT THE LACK
OF DATA THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:47.829
THE SMALL DOLLAR LOANS AND WHEN
I LOOK AT THE RESERVE OPPOSE OR

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:51.733
FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH ON A FIVE
HUNDRED TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.971
DOLLAR LOAN IS A LOT AND THE
INTEREST RATE IS THERE FOR A

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.740
NUMBER OF THINGS YES YOU TALK
ABOUT A FEVER SINCE AN INTEREST

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:03.979
RATE BUT TO CONSUMER ITS COST
OF MONEY TO THAT CONSUMER AND

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:07.449
WE'RE TALKING GETTING BACK TO
SOME EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS OF

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:12.587
MONEY THAT CONSUMERS CAN END UP
HAVING TO PAY FOR THAT ORIGINAL

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:19.094
LOAN TO THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN
THE VERY WARY OF THESE KINDS

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:22.397
OF RELATIONSHIPS UP FOR ME
I'M WAS CLASS THAT THIS WAS AN

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:25.934
INFORMATIONAL HEARING I THINK
IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:29.371
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PILOT
PROGRAM OTHERS WORK THE LOANS

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:34.276
AVAILABILITY IN THIS DOLLAR
RANGE OKAY THAT'S A LEGITIMATE

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:37.679
CONVERSATION TO HAVE BUT
WITHOUT THE DATA AND THE FACT

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:41.016
IS THAT THE REGULATOR STARTING
TO LOOK AND COLLECT SOME OF

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:44.553
THAT INFORMATION I THINK THAT'S
GOING TO BE MUCH MORE USEFUL

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:48.990
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
DECISIONS OFF OF THAT AND THEN

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:54.463
A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS SO HAVING
BEEN AROUND THIS FOR SUCH TIME

01:18:54.529 --> 01:19:00.635
JUST CALL ME SKEPTICAL AT THIS
POINT ANYWAY -- I THINK THAT

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:04.573
EXHAUSTS ARE QUESTIONS MR THE
APPROVER YOU MAY CLOSE YES

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:08.276
WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY I
THINK WE WE ALL NEED A ROBUST

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:12.814
A PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA AS YOU
HEARD A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:17.018
TO OUT OF THE STATE AND I LIVE
IN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU KNOW

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:21.389
GOING ON ONLINE SOME SOMETIMES
PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THAT I MEAN

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:24.826
THEY DON'T THEY WANT TO GO INTO
A STORE AND TALK TO SOMEONE

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:31.099
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE TOUCH
AND SPEAK AND AND BE ONLINE

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:34.402
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T HAVE THAT
AND THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:37.572
BEING ASKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY
THE COSTS EXPENSIVE WE'RE IN

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:41.910
CALIFORNIA A REMINDER SO EVEN
IF YOU COMPARE OTHER STATES

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:44.813
ARE STILL LIVING CALIFORNIA
TO PUT A STOREFRONT IT'S NOT

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:50.585
CHEAP IT'S EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW
SO -- WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:56.558
THAT PEOPLE CAN RELY ON PEOPLE
TO HAVE TRUST THAT THEY CAN

01:19:56.625 --> 01:20:01.429
WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO SO
MANY ISSUES AND PROBLEMS IN

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:04.533
CALIFORNIA THAT PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW WHO TO TALK WHO TO TURN

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:08.470
TO AND ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO
IS MAKE SURE THAT IT WHEN THEY

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:13.975
NEED ALONE THAT THEY CAN GO TO
THAT STORE THEY CAN GO TO THAT

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:18.613
PERSON WHO THEY FEEL THEY'RE TO
ME THAT THEY CAN TRUST SO I L.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.316
LEAVE THAT WITH YOU CHAIRMAN
MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:24.286
TIME TODAY THANK YOU CAN
THINK OF RIGHT WE JUST HAD

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:29.858
ONE ITEM OF INFORMATION ONLY
AND WITH THAT WE ARE ADJOURNED
