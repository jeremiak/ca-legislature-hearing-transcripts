THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING IS OF COURSE THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA AND SPECIFICALLY THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS INDEPENDENT FACT FINDING REVIEW. WE ARE FOCUSED ON. THIS REVIEW BECAUSE THE CENTRAL ISSUE THAT WE ARE. ALL TRYING TO ADDRESS. IS. THE ISSUE OF. INTERFERENCE. SPECIFIC. AND INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE. UP BY THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND THE STATE AUDITOR'S. WELL AUDIT THAT WAS ORIGINALLY REQUESTED BY. ASSEMBLY BUDGET YOUR TING. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. WE HAD THE HEARING GO IN MAY OF LAST YEAR. UP THE THREE JOINT COMMITTEES. THAT WE HAVE RECONVENE TODAY. AND AT THAT HEARING ON MAY SECOND. THE STATE AUDITOR DETAIL THE MANY FINDINGS OF HER AUDIT. ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT SHE. CONCLUDED THAT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. HAD INTENTIONALLY INTERFERED WITH THE AUDIT PROCESS. AND THAT THE AUDITING STANDARDS. REQUIRED OF HER IN HER OFFICE. PREVENTED HER FROM. A DRAWING VALLEY CONCLUSIONS AS TO. THE PORTION OF THE AUDIT. THAT. WAS FOCUSED. ON THE ISSUE OF DUPLICATE DUPLICATIVE SERVICES. BETWEEN THE YOU SEE OKAY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND THE CAMPUSES. AT THE OVERSIGHT HEARING ON MAY SECOND. PRESIDENT A POLL TONTO. STATED THAT OUR TEAM MADE THE DECISION TO WORK WITH THE CAMPUSES AND RESPONDING TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S CAMPUS SURVEYS. TO INSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF THE AUDIT. AND THE AUDIT SCOPE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ENGAGEMENT SHE STATED WAS TO HELP. ENSURE THAT ACCURATE RESPONSIVE INFORMATION WAS CONVEYED TO THE AUDIT TEAM. AND THE PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME FOR FURTHER STATED. IT CLEARLY WAS NOT A PROCESS THAT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU SEE OP LOOK GOOD. FURTHERMORE AT THAT SAME HEARING AND THEN CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. CHAIR LOZANO STATED THAT PRESIDENT OF ALL TARO. HAD QUOTE ASSURED HER. THAT THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE HAD NO INTENT TO INFLUENCE THE RESULTS. BUT RATHER SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT THE SURVEY RESPONSES WERE FACTUALLY ACCURATE. AND REFLECTED THE VIEWS OF THE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP. THAT IS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE RECEIVED. JUSTICE MORAN DOES. REPORT THE INDEPENDENT FACT FINDER REVIEW. THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS. OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT. JUSTICE MARINO'S INDEPENDENT REPORT. CONFIRMED THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE AUDITOR. OF THE INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE. ON THE PART OF THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND SO HERE TODAY. WE WANT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. WE WELCOME CAL FOR CALIFORNIA CHIEF. JUSTICE CARLOS MORENO. TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF HIS FACT FINDING REVIEW. WE WILL THEN. WELCOME. THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS GEORGE KEEFER. AND THEN. WE WELCOME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA JANET NAPOLITANO. TO. RESPOND. TWO THE FACT FINDING REVIEW. NOW LET ME SAY THAT UP AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER. I THINK I SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND FOR MANY OF US IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THAT WE ARE. PROUD OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AS. IN MY OPINION. THE PAST. PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. AND IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE COMMITTED. TO. PROTECTING THEIR BRAND. AND TO. FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO. RESTORE SOME QUESTIONS OF TRUST. IN MOVING FORWARD IN WORKING TOGETHER. TO SUPPORT. OUR STEAMED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. THAT WE APPROACH THIS HEARING HERE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOW INVITE THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY. COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION. MR MEDINA TO SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU CHAIR. A MERCER G.. LAST TIME THAT WE GATHER HERE I THINK I EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT. IN. PRESIDENT OF THE UC. AND I I I STATED THAT PUBLICLY. BUT AS WE BEGAN THIS TODAY'S HEARING. I I I WANT TO GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE. AND EXPRESS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND THAT IS. PICKING UP WHERE I CHAIR. A SAID ABOUT THE PRIDE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I I WANNA REMIND. THIS A COMMITTEE. AS WE TALK ABOUT THE LONG HISTORY THE LONG PROUD TRADITION OF UC. A UNIVERSITY THAT WAS FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. THE US SOON AFTER OF UNITE PARA CALIFORNIA JOINED THE UNION. THAT IT HAS BEEN AND AS FACED MANY OTHER CRISIS. BEFORE AND ITS LONG HISTORY. AND AS I THOUGHT OF THAT I WENT BACK AND SAW. BUT CURRENT A RECENT ARTICLE. IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES I TALKED ABOUT THE LOYALTY OATH CRISIS. THAT THE UNIVERSITY FACED IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES. WHERE THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF? BASS FOR LOYALTY OATHS. ON THE FACULTY. AND HOW THAT GREW. TO SHAKE. THE CONFIDENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ALMOST. AS THE ARTICLE POINTED OUT DESTROYED THE UNIVERSITY. THEN I THINK BACK TO. FURTHER ON NINETEEN SIXTIES WITH STUDENT UNREST ON THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. AND THEN GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN. A FIERY. PRESIDENT CLARK KERR. AND SO I WANT TO SAY A WORD OF CAUTION. THAT AS WE'VE MOVED FORWARD AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR. THAT WE THINK. AND THINK DEEPLY. A AND LONG ABOUT BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION. OF AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS IT. PERTAINS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND AND I THINK UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE PREMIER INSTITUTION THAT IT IS. OF PARTLY BECAUSE IT HAS HAD THE ABILITY TO STAY OUTSIDE THE FRAY OR REMAIN. A. A TIMES. AND SO I I CAUTIONED US TO THROW OUT THE BABY WITH THE BATH WATER. AND. AND TO THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT WE DO. AS IT PERTAINS TO YOU SEE. AND. AND TO TO BE CAUTIOUS. BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO A. THE GOING OVER AND LISTENING TO. JUSTICE MODANO. AND. AND. TO HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER TING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ANY OPENING COMMENTS. OKAY. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO INVITES OF. THE IN THE VICE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE SENATOR ROTH WOULD YOU LIKE TO SING OKAY. ALRIGHT. ABOUT I'D LIKE TO NOW ASK. JUSTICE MORENO. PLEASE SIR. COME TO THE TABLE WELCOME YOUR HONOR. PLEASE SIR NOTE WE WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN NOW. MAKE A PRESENTATION. THE. OH GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S A PLEASURE. TO BE HERE. OF BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION THE. HI MY NAME IS CARLOS MORENO SAYS HERE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD. AND OF FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME I SERVED ON. VARIOUS CALIFORNIA COURTS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE LAST TEN OF WHICH RUN THE. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. NO I ALONG WITH FEEL LAW FIRM OF HOUSTON HENNIGAN. IN LOS ANGELES WERE RETAINED BY THE UC REGENTS. TO CONDUCT A FACT FINDING THE. REVIEW TEAM. REGARDING CERTAIN ALLEGATIONS. THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF. CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT YOU COPD. HAD INTERFERED WITH THE CAMPUS RESPONSES TO SURVEYS DISTRIBUTED BY THESE. STATE AUDITOR IN CONNECTION WITH A CERTAIN AUDIT. NO THE SCOPE OF OUR. WORK AS WE DEFINED IT. CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUEST FROM THE UC REGENTS. WAS FIRST TO. DETERMINE WHETHER YOU COPD. INTERFERED IN PREPARATION. CAMPUS SURVEY RESPONSES. SECOND IF THERE WAS INTERFERENCE. THE REASON FOR SUCH AN APPEARANCE. THIRD AT WHOSE DIRECTION THE INTERFERENCE TOOK PLACE. FOR ALL RELEVANT FACTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SUCH. DIRECTION AND OR INTERFERENCE. AND FIFTH ANY FACTS RELEVANT. TO THE CONTEXT. FOR ANY SUCH PURPORTED INVOLVEMENT. NOW AFTER THE SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY OF OUR. A FACT FINDING MISSION. I WOULD LET THE. COMMITTEES HERE NO THAT WE INTERVIEWED THIRTY EIGHT PERCEPTIVE WITNESSES. MANY OF THOSE WERE IN PERSON OTHERS WERE TELEPHONICALLY. ACROSS THE BROAD SCOPE OF EACH OF THE TEN CAMPUSES. YEAH I AM THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES. WE REVIEWED APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOCUMENTS. THAT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF OUR EMAILS AND TEXT MESSAGES AND OTHER. PERTINENT DOCUMENTS. WE ALSO REVIEWED AUDIT STANDARDS BLOW YOU SEE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES. AND CALIFORNIA STATUTES GOVERNING PUBLIC AUDITS. AS TO OUR FINDINGS ONE WE ARE ASKED. WE WERE TASKED WITH DETERMINING WHETHER INTERFERENCE OCCURRED. SECOND WE DEFINED INTERFERENCE. QUITE BROADLY ACTUALLY. AS ANY ACTION THAT HAD THE EFFECT OF HINDERING. OR IMPEDING. A SURVEY RESPONSES. THIS DEFINITION OF INTERFERENCE IS NOT BASED ON ANY. CIVIL OR CRIMINAL OF STATUTE. IT IS ALSO A STRICT LIABILITY PROVISION. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE INTENT TO INTERFERE. ALTHOUGH WE DID FIND THAT SOME ACTIONS WERE TAKEN. WITH THIS PURPOSE. I SHOULD NOTE THE AS AN ASIDE. THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF AN AUDIT. AS WE HAVE HERE. THAT IS WHERE THE. MANAGEMENT UCL P.. IS THAT. PARTY. THAT THAT. PARTICULAR ASPECT IN THE CONTEXT. AND ANY INTERFERENCE AS WE'VE DEFINED WOULD AFFECT THE RELIABILITY OF ANY SURVEY. SPONSORS. IN OTHER WORDS. IF THE SUBJECT BEING AUDITED. HAS ANY KIND OF ROLE. ANY KIND OF INPUT. IN THE AUDIT ITSELF. THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE LA INTERFERENCE EVEN THOUGH THE CONTENT. OR THE MOTIVE. A WAS COMPLETELY OF THE NIGHT WITH A VERY BROAD. THE DEFINITION OF INTERFERENCE THAT WE WILL APPLY. OUR FINDINGS REGARDING INTERFERENCE. PARSE FOLLOWS. WE FOUND THAT YOU SEE OPIATE. INTERFERE AS WE'VE DEFINED THAT. HAVE A BETTER INTERFERENCE COMPRISED R. CONSISTED OF FOUR ACTIONS. ONE. INFORMING CAMPUSES THAT CHANCELLOR'S WERE TO REVIEW THE SURVEY RESPONSES. TOGETHER WITH INFORMING CAMPUSES SECOND. THAT YOU CO P.. WOULD ALSO OF REVIEW. THIRD. WE ALSO FOUND THAT INFORMING CAMPUSES THAT SURVEY RESPONSES. WE'RE NOT A TIME TO QUOTE AIR DIRTY LAUNDRY. AND FOURTH TYPE OF INTERFERENCE WAS SUGGESTING REVISIONS. AND CHANGES TO RESPONSES. THAT REFLECTED POORLY FUND. A UC OPIATE ALMOST. I WOULD SAY LARGELY IF NOT. EXCLUSIVELY THE REVISIONS. TENDED TO PUT. THE UC OPIUM A MORE FAVORABLE AS OPPOSED TO UNFAVORABLE. FILED LYFT. WE ALSO FOUND THAT PRESIDENT APOLLO TUNNEL APPROVED A PLAN. THAT INVOLVED THE FIRST TWO ACTS THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED. THAT IS ONE. INFORMING CAMPUSES THAT CHANCELLORS WERE TO REVIEW THE RESPONSE WAS. IT'S PART OF THE. CAMPUS MEAL. AND SECOND. THE CAMPUSES PERFORMED AT UC OP WOULD UP REVIEW. THOSE RESPONSES. HOWEVER THE EVIDENCE WE FOUND. IS INSUFFICIENT BUT TO CONCLUDE. THAT SHE KNEW OF OR APPROVED. THE LATTER TWO ACTIONS. THAT IS. INFORMING CAMPUSES THAT THEIR SURVEY RESPONSES WERE NOT THE TIME TO AIR DIRTY LAUNDRY. AND SECOND. SUGGESTING REVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESPONSES THAT REFLECTED POORLY. ON UC LP. NOW THESE FIRST TWO ACTIONS THAT I'VE DESCRIBED INVOLVED INTERFERENCE. BECAUSE IN A VERY LARGE SENSE. THE CHILLED A CAMPUS RESPONSES. INDEED ONE TRAPS WERE ADMITTED TO REVISING. HIS ANSWERS AS A RESULT. OF THESE TWO ACTIONS. WHAT I MEAN TO SAY BY THAT IS THAT? SIMPLY KNOWING. FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S PERSPECTIVE. SUBORDINATES OF THAT CHANCELLOR. THAT YOU SEE OP WOULD REVIEW SURVEY RESPONSES. IN EFFECT PLACED A CHILLING EFFECT ON. OF THOSE. RESPONSES. THE PRESIDENT DAN CHIEF OF STAFF AND THEN DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. ENGAGED IN THE LETTER TO ACTIONS. THAT IS THE AIRING OF DIRTY LAUNDRY AND ALSO MAKING THE REVISIONS. A TWO THE. SURVEY RESPONSES. THEY INFORMED CAMPUSES THAT THE SURVEYS WERE NOT THE TIME TO REVEAL. NEGATIVE INFORMATION. AND THE PATIENT SUBMIT THEIR RESPONSE TO YOU FEEL PRETTY. FOR THE AUDITOR FOR REVIEW. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF. THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF THEN PROVIDED COMMENTS. THE SOME CAMPUSES ABOUT. THEIR RESPONSES. NOW THESE ACTIONS OBVIOUSLY INTERFERED WITH THE RESPONSES. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THESE ACTIONS WERE UNDERTAEN BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. WITH THE PURPOSE. WITH THE PURPOSE PREVENTING SOME NEGATIVE INFORMATION. FROM THE CAMPUSES ACTUALLY REACHING THE STATE AUDITOR. BY YOU FEEL P.. THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT AND OF HER SUBORDINATES OFFERED THREE REASONS. PORTS PLAN TO REVIEW AND TO COMMENT UPON THE SURVEYS. FIRST. THAT YOU FEEL P. INTENDED TO REVIEW. INTO THE BILL REVIEW FLAG RESPONSES WHICH WERE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. THAT RESPONSES WOULD BE FACTUALLY ACCURATE. AND THIRD. THAT THE SURVEY RESPONSES WOULD REFLECT THE ACTUAL VIEWS. OF THE CAMPUS CHANCELLOR IN QUESTION. SECOND. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF PROFFERED THAT. THE CAMPUS IS THEMSELVES. EXPRESSED CONFUSION REGARDING. A SURVEY. AND IN THAT SENSE WELCOMED ANY KIND OF INPUT. BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND THIRD. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED THAT THEY RELY ON THE ADVICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL. IN CONDUCTING THE REVIEW. REGARDING. THE FIRST A POINT. THAT IS TO ENSURE THE SKILL BACKERS SEE. AND THE VIEWS OF THE. CHANCELLOR. THE COMMENTS PROVIDED ON THE SURVEY RESPONSES. AS WE'VE ANALYZE THOSE. WE'RE NOT IN FACT LIMITED. SCOPE ACCURACY IN CHANCELLOR REVIEW. REGARDING THE SECOND POINT. AND THAT IS WHETHER OR NOT IN THE CAMPUSES THEMSELVES FOR EXPRESS SOME DEGREE OF CONFUSION. CONSERVING THE SURVEY. ITSELF. WE FIND THE ASSERTION THAT THE. CAMPUSES WE'RE CONFUSED GENERALLY. GENERALLY. UNSUPPORTED. BY THE RECORD ALTHOUGH. INTERNALLY A WITHIN CAMPUSES THERE WAS SOME. DEGREE A CONFUSION ABOUT WHO WOULD BE THE DESIGNATED. OF RESPONDER. AND I BELIEVE ON THE. SURVEY THE SERVICES RESPOND SURVEY. THEREWERE APPROXIMATELY SIXTY QUESTIONS THAT HAD TO BE DISTRIBUTED OUT TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON CAMPUS SO TO THAT DEGREE. THE OTHER MAY HAVE BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHO THE PROPER RESPONDER WAS. FOR CERTAIN DRUG QUESTIONS. AT A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT CHANCELLOR'S DID COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SERVICE. BUT THE RECORD DOES NOT REFLECT. THAT PASSED WITH THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE. TO ASSIST OR REVIEW THE RESPONSES. THE THIRD POINT. THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL DID PLAY SIGNIFICA THAT A MITIGATING FACTOR. IN RESPONSE TO CAMUS CONCERNS. YOU CO P. SOUGHT ADVICE AS TO THE LEGALITY. OF THE PLAN THAT IS HAVING. YOU FEEL PEER REVIEW OF THE RESPONSES. THE OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL ADVICE CORRECTLY. WELL AS FAR AS THAT WENT. THAT THE STATUTE CITED BY THE STATE AUDITOR GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION EIGHTY FIVE FORTY FIVE. BE. DID NOT PRECLUDE THE CAMPUSES FROM SHARING SURVEY RESPONSES. THAT WASN'T ADMONITION CONTAINED IN THE PREFACE TO THE SURVEY THAT THEY WERE NOT TO SHARE THEIR. RESPONSES WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS. THE OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNCIL ADVISE YOU FEEL P.. HOWEVER OF THE POLITICAL. RISK OF THE PLAN. THAT THE STATE AUDITOR WOULD TO NO DOUBT IT AT SOME POINT. COMMENT ON CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE GIVEN THE. THE TRACKING. OF THEIR SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO SEE. THE INITIAL DRAFT AMENDMENTS AND SO FORTH. RIGHT UP AND DOWN. OF THE LINE. LATER IN THE PROCESS THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL OF DEPUTY. THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL. PROVIDED REVISIONS RELEASED AND IN ONE INSTANCE WORKS. SARAH CREWS INSTANCE. PROVIDED REVISIONS TO THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF COMMENTS TO ONE CAMPUSES OF SURVEY RESPONSES. HOWEVER WE CONCLUDE. BUT IT IS NOT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL. APPROVED OF THE PLAN IN QUESTION. THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL DID PROVIDE ADVICE ON THE STATUTE IN QUESTION THAT WAS AS FAR AS IT WENT. ACCURATE. AT FACE VALUE THE. ADVICE WAS ACCURATE. BUT THE OFFICE ALSO WARNED OF THE POLITICAL RISKS ATTENDANT POSED BY OF THE PLAN. AND THOSE POLITICAL RISKS. WOULD THAT BE A RESULT. OF CHANGES BEING MADE TO THE INITIAL. OF SURVEY RESPONSES. THERE WAS ALSO. NO ONE INSTANCE. WHERE? RELUCTANTLY THE. THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL AGAIN ADVISING AGAINST FOR. OF THE PLAN. SAID WILL SOME OF MY OF PEOPLE AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. WOULD LIKE. THE AUDITOR TO KNOW THAT. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IS REVIEWING THE RESPONSES. I HOPE THERE'S NO RESPONSE FORTHCOMING FROM. EITHER THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF. AND ULTIMATELY THE. A STATE AUDITOR WAS NOT ADVISED AT LEAST THAT TIME. THAT THESE. SURVEY RESPONSES WERE BEING REVIEWED. AROUND BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL IS MORE DIRECT INVOLVEMENT. ALSO WAS AFTER YOU SEE OP HAD MADE THE DECISION TO REVIEW RESPONSES. AND AFTER SEVERAL CAMPUSES A BEEN ADVISED TO RECONSIDER RESPONSES THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED. TO REFLECT POORLY ON YOU FEEL P.. THE PRESIDENT. PREVENTION OF OF STAFF. AND. THEN DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF ALL STATE IN RETROSPECT. BUT THE REVIEW PLAN WAS AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT AND THEY DID NOT INTEND TO. INTERFERE WITH A RESPONSE OF. AB BEFORE I CONCLUDE. I JUST WANT TO. HAD WANT OTHER OF PERTINENT OBSERVATION. ON ITS FACE EVEN THE TWO PART PLAN. OF WHICH I DESCRIBED. AND OF WHICH. PRESIDENT APOLLO TUNNEL APPROVED. YEAH CONSTITUTED INTERFERENCE IN THE SUBMISSION OF SURVEY RESPONSES. FROM THE CAMPUS WAS TO THE STATE AUDITOR. IN ADOPTING SUCH A PLAN YOU SEE OP WAS AFFIRMATIVELY NOTIFYING EACH CAMPUS CHANCELLOR. THAT FEAR SHE. WOULD BE SEEN AS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. FOR ANY STATEMENT CRITICAL OF YOU CO P.. IN THE SURVEY OF RESPONSES. FURTHER IN ADOPTING THE TWO PART PLAN USE YOUR P. TOLD EACH CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. BUT THE CAMPUS SHOULD SHOULD SUBMIT. I CAPS RESPONSES TO YOU SEE OP FOR REVIEW. BEFORE SUBMISSION TO THE STATE AUDITOR. MEANING. THAT ANY CRITICISM FROM THE CAMPUS WAS WOULD BECOME KNOWN. DO YOU CO P.. AND SHORT THE REVIEW PLAN WAS LIKELY TO AND AT LEAST IN ONE CASE THE CHILL. CAPAS RESPONSES TO THE STATE PEARL AUDITOR. ALTHOUGH IT HAD THE EFFECT OF INTERFERING WITH THE CAMPUS RESPONSES THE PLAN THAT. PRESIDENT APOLLO TUNNELING KNOWLEDGE IS ADOPTING DID NOT. DID NOT ON ITS FACE ATTEMPT ALTERED THROUGH INFLUENCE FOR SUBSTANTIVE. SURVEY RESPONSES. REPAIRED AND SUBMITTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES. HOWEVER. A BEYOND THAT. HER CHIEF OF STAFF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TOOK THOSE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. BUT I'VE DESCRIBED. TO DO JUST THAT. AND IN WHICH IN MANY CASES ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED. IN CHANGING THE SURVEY RESPONSES. VIRTUALLY ELIMINATING EVERY SINGLE. UP POR UM RATING RESPONSE. THE ADVICE CAMPUSES TO REFRAIN FROM INCLUDING NEGATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU SEE OPIATE. AND ITS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THEY ALSO PROVIDED DETAILED COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE CAMPUS OF SURVEY RESPONSES. BUT BECAUSE SOME CAMPUSES TO REVISE THE RESPONSES TO REFLECT. IN THE END. MORE FAVORABLY UPON UC OP. WE CONCLUDE. THAT PRESIDENT APOLLO TARO. HAS REPRESENTED THAT SHE DID NOT APPROVE AND WOULD NOT OF APPROVED. OF THE EXECUTION OF ANY PLAN. THAT INCLUDED THESE LATTER TWO ACTIONS. FURTHER SHARE STATED THAT SHE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT HER. CHIEF OF STAFF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. ENGAGED HERE IN THESE ACTIONS. WE CONCLUDE. THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS INSUFFICIENT AND INCONCLUSIVE. THAT THE PRESIDENT OF ALITALIA APPROVED OR HAD KNOWLEDGE. THOSE TWO. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. WELL I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS. OF THE CHAIR RELATED CHAIRS OR ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUSTICE MORENO. DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I CAN GET US STARTED OUT. MS BAKER NOTHING I REALLY ON THE OTHER END OF THESE DISCUSSIONS BUT BECAUSE. THANK YOU JUSTICE. NORMALLY IT WOULD APPEAR FOR. FOR YOU ON A DIFFERENT SIDE SERVICES HAVE BEEN FRIENDS AT HOME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY A FEW QUESTIONS. IN THE U. GATHERED I THINK OF A FOREIGNER THOUSAND DOCUMENTS YOU MENTIONED YES. AND ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY THAT WERE WITHHELD THAT THE UNIVERSE HE SAID YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE YOU THOSE DID AT ANY POINT DID THEY SAY NO YOU CAN'T HAVE THEIR VERY. INVOLVED AND WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE GOT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE APARTMENT DOCKING. AND AND WAS THAT. SO WHEN SHE IT PRINT THE SCOPE WITH THE ASK WAS ANYTHING RELATED TO SURVEYS INTO HOW HOW DID YOU DEFINE THEY. THE WEB THAT YOU CAST. NO I DON'T HAVE THE PRECISE AND YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE OTHER LAWYERS ACCUSED AND HAVING HIM CAST A BROAD NET. AND THERE'S A FORMS OF ELECTRONIC DISCOVERY I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT IF. WE WERE SATISFIED THAT. WE HAD EVERYTHING OKAY THANK YOU AND. WHAT DID YOU DETERMINE AT ANY POINT? IF THE PRESIDENT APOLOGIZED NO. AFTER. I HAD THE SURVEYS WERE RECALLED WHICH YOU'RE SAYING WAS SHE WAS AWARE OF THAT THE SURVEYS ARE BEING RECALL YES. DID AT ANYTIME AFTER THAT DID YOU FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT SHE THEN. CIRCLE BACK WITH HERS STAFF THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF AND CHIEF OF STAFF TO CHECK AND ABOUT THE SERVICE. WHAT? DID SHE. INQUIRE ABOUT HOW THAT WAS GOING HER OR CHECK ON THE STATUS OF THE SURVEYS AFTER THEY HAD BEEN RECALLED. I DON'T HAVE ANY PRESENT RECOLLECTION OF THAT I DO KNOW WHAT I CAN SAY POSITIVELY THAT. SHE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE SUGGESTED REVISIONS THAT WERE BEING MADE A BUYER STAFFERS TO WHETHER OR NOT. SHE HAD A GENERAL. KNOWLEDGE OR DISCUSSION WITH. HER SUBORDINATES LISTA HOW THE SURVEY RESPONSES WERE COMING AND I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT OKAY. AND SUPER SO NO AWARENESS OF IF SHE FOLLOWED UP WITH THEM TO SEE AFTER THE DIRECTIVE HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO RECALL THEM TO TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE GOING THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. AND DID YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT WOULD LEAD TO WHAT SHE THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN ONCE THEY CAME BACK TO THAT WHAT'D WHAT'D SHE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. FOR WHAT PURPOSE WAS THAT GOING TO BE. WELL THE THIS STATED THE PURPOSE FOR THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE UC OP GENERALLY WAS TO BASICALLY. ASSURE THAT THE RESPONSES WERE WITHIN THE SCOPE. LEARNED THE OBJECTIVE OF THE AUDITOR'S. SURVEY. OF THAT THOSE RESPONSES WERE ACCURATE IN NATURE. AND THAT ALSO THAT THEY ACCURATELY REFLECT THE CHANCELLOR'S. VIEW THE CAMPUS WAS VIEW. OF. BECAUSE YOU HAD IN SOME INSTANCES I MENTIONED WITH SIXTY QUESTIONS BEING DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT. MANY LAYERS OF CAMPUS BUREAUCRACY. OTHER SMALL LIARS I WOULD THINK AND. V. UP PRESIDENT UNDERSTAND ONE OF TO MAKE SURE THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT THE RESPONSES REFLECT THE VIEWS OF THAT CAMPUS IN THE FORM OF THE CHANCELLOR'S VIEWS OKAY ARE YOU CAN THAT WAS THEIR STATED PURPOSE START HAVE YOU CONCLUDED THAT THAT. THEY STE BUT THAT WHAT'S THE PURPOSE EXACT WORLD I AND WE CONCLUDED THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE. BUT TO SUBORDINATES AND QUESTION THAT. OTHER WAS SOME INTENT THERE. LOVE THEN BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR COMMENTS WENT BEYOND SCOPE ACCURACY AND CHANCELLORS BICU. AND THAT'S WHAT'S DETAILED IN THE REPORT IN THE APPENDIX. AND WE CONCLUDE THAT THEIR OBJECTIVE OR MOTIVE IF YOU WILL. WAS TO ASSURE THAT THE UNFAVORABLE RESPONSES WERE SENSUALLY DELETED. IN THE THAT IS PART OF WHAT YOUR TEAM ASKED FOR ANY SAY THEIR CALENDAR ENTRIES FOR AFTER THE SURVEY'S RECALLED MEETINGS BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND HER DEPUTY A DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. ANY. EITHER EMAILS. AFTER THAT OR ANY ENTRIES IN THE CALENDAR SHOWING THAT THEY WERE HAVING MEETINGS SHORTLY AFTER THE SURVEYS ARE RECALLED. WILL CLEARLY OTHER THERE WERE THERE WERE MADE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY MEETING CERTAINLY WE PILED. DISCUSSIONS A BETWEEN THE. DEPUTY CHIEF STUFF AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN. I WITH THE PRESIDENT. BY WHAT THE PRESIDENT JUST BE BETWEEN THEMSELVES OKAY. AND SO WE HAVE IT MAY NOT HAVE HEARD TALENT THE PRESIDENT'S CALENDAR TO FIND OUT IF SHE MET WITH HER DEPUTY AND. CHIEF OF STAFF. EITHER ABOUT THAT SUBJECT MATTER OTHERWISE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THE RECORD THAT SHE IN ANY WAY HAVE ANY INPUT AS TO. REVISING OR COMMENTING ON THE RESPONSE OF THEMSELVES AND THEN THERE'S ONE NOTE IN YOUR REPORT ON PAGE TWENTY FIVE JUST MENTION HAS TO DO WITH THE SANTA CRUZ EMAIL WITH WHICH IS GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION. AND AND IT JUST MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF COURSE PRESIDENTE PALATINUS ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SURVEY RESPONSES FROM UC SANTA CRUZ ARE THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE ON WHICH TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD. THAT MEMBERS OF HER STAFF WERE SYSTEMATICALLY HIGHLIGHTED OR SANITIZING CRITICAL COMMENTS FROM THE CAMPUSES. BUT YOUR CONCLUSION IS NOT THAT SHE KNEW. THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING. BUT SO I'M AYE. IF YOU CAN JUST HELP US FIND WHAT WAS THE COUNTERBALANCE SEEN EVIDENCE THAT TO THE SANTA CRUZ EMAIL. WE MATCH IT'S THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE ROSE YOU IS WELL AWARE OF SYSTEMATIC. SANITIZING WHAT WAS THE COUNTER BALLOT THOUGH THAT THE COUNTER BALANCE AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION. CORRECTLY IS THAT THAT DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR AND. NOW THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEONE. INDISPUTABLE TONE AND SOFORTH. AND ONE CONCLUSION BASED UPON. THE TONE MAYBE THAT. SHE WAS MORE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT. SHE WAS MORE THAN JUST UPSET ABOUT THE FACT THAT. LOVE THE CHANCELLOR. SUBMITTED THE. RESPONSES WITHOUT CLEARING THEM THROUGH YOU STILL PAY. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT WE FOUND THAT SHE KNEW. THAT SOME OF THOSE INITIAL RESPONSES WHICH ARE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOUND TO BE. PROBLEMATICAL. OF THAT SHE HAD ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE. OF THOSE RESPONSES WE SAY THE SERBS IN KEEPING THE SPECIFIC WORDS INCIDENT WORD YES OKAY YEAH SO SHOULDN'T THERE WAS A BIT OF AUDITING. OR EDITING RATHER. BETWEEN THE DEPUTY CHIEF STAFF. AND THE CHANCELLOR THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH AND ULTIMATELY. OF THE CHANCELLOR BASICALLY EXCEEDED TO WHATEVER CHANGES WERE SUGGESTED. BY THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. BUT IN SO FAR AS THAT. GOES EMAILS LE. ARE CONCERNED THEY DO NOT REFLECT ANY KNOWLEDGE OR IMPLIED BY THE PRESIDENT. OKAY AND I AND I GET SCHEDULED A LOOK AT THE SHE WASN'T AWARE. ARE YOU SEE THAT SHE WAS AWARE THE SPECIFIC CHANGES THAT WERE MADE BY RISE OF WHERE THE CHANGES WERE BEING MADE. WELL THEY WERE BEING REVIEWED AND WHETHER IF THAT'S CONSIDERED REVIEWED A RECOMMENDATION WAS READ. THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS FOR YOU COPD. SUBORDINATES TO REVIEW. THANK YOU ALL THAT THANK YOU IN LAST WHEN IS IS THE. YOU MENTIONED THE OPINION THAT THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE PROVIDED WHO REQUESTED THAT. WAS IT THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF THE CHIEF OF STAFF THE PRESIDENT WAS THERE ANY. FOR SOME WHO MAY HAVE REQUESTED THAT OPINION THAT I BELIEVE IN THAT. I BELIEVE WAS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF INITIALLY. WHEN HE SOUGHT ADVICE THAT WAS ULTIMATELY PROVIDED. BY THE ACTUAL OH GENERAL COUNSEL. BELLS EARLY IN THE PROCESS. AND THAT JUST DEALT WITH THE. PRELIMINARY QUESTION. OF THE AS TO WHETHER IT WAS PROPER TO SHARE. THE SURVEY RESPONSES OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS SO WHAT IS OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS MAIN. DOES IT INCLUDE THE THE OFFICE WITH THE PRESIDENT THE YES OR NO. WITH LIMITED THE TO THAT LATER. THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL DID GET INVOLVED IN THE WORD SMITHING IF YOU WILL. THE SANTA CRUZ FOR. EXCHANGE AND IN FACT AS I RECALL THERE'S EVEN. AT THE VERY BEGINNING. ADVICE WAS SOUGHT. AS TO WHAT EXACTLY WAS THIS THE AUDITOR'S SCOPE OF AUTHORITY. AND I BELIEVE THE CONCLUSION WAS TAKEN ASKING GET ANYTHING THEY WANT. SAID IT WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU SAW. ANY EMAILS OR EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESIDENT HERSELF. WAS AWARE OR HAD REQUESTED OF HER DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TO GET ANY LEGAL OPINION AND THAT IT HAD BEEN SURE DIRECTLY WITH HER. NOT TO SOLICIT THE ADVICE BUT LATER SHE WAS ADVISED. THAT THAT ADVICE HAD BEEN OBTAINED AND THEY WERE GOOD TO GO. AT LEAST ON ITEMS ONE AND TWO. AND DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT INDICATED WHETHER NOT THE PRESIDENT WAS WE ARE AWARE THAT THE SURVEYS. WE'RE MEANT TO BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL OR HAVE THAT STAMP ON THEM. THAT THIS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS AWARE OF THAT. CONFIDENTIAL AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. WELL FROM OUR UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE AUDITOR HAD MARKED THE SURVEYS. DON'T SHARE OUTSIDE THE CAMP ALSO THE CAMPUS ARE YOU WHERE DID YOU FIND ANY INDICATION IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THE PRESIDENT KNEW THAT THE AUDITOR HAD GIVEN THAT INSTRUCTION. NOT SO MUCH HOW SHE MIGHT INTERPRET IT IF SHE DID KNOW BUT THAT DID YOU DID YOU FIND ANY OF IT SHE KNEW THAT WAS INSTRUCTION FROM THE AUDITOR HIM LIKE THAT TO BE HONEST I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE. ABOUT THAT BUT CLEARLY SHE FELT SHE HAD THE IMPRIMATUR. ALL THE GENERAL COUNSEL AT SOME STAGE TO HAVE YOU CO PEER REVIEW. AND IN THE COURSE OF YOUR. REVIEW OF ALL THIS DID YOU REVIEW THE PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY TO THIS COMMITTEE BACK EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT THE AUDIT REPORT AND I THINK. I DON'T RECALL I'M SURE I SAW EXCERPTS OF IT EITHER IN THE NEWS OR ELSEWHERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR SACK AROUND. ON THE U. SO MUCH. JUSTICE FOR FOR YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS. I I WANTED TO JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR SENSE OF. OF. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET WHEN I. WHEN. WHEN SWENSON ONE GETS A FIFTY PAGE SURVEY. I. IS IT NOT. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF IN HERE EVERY SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING AT THAT QUESTION OF HOW COMPLICATED THE SURVEY WASN'T? WHETHER IT BE REASONABLE FOR. PEOPLE TO WANT TO RUN SOME OF THE. RESPONSES THAT THE CHAIN NOT BECAUSE ATTORNEY HIDE SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A DIFFICULT COMPLEX SURVEY WITH A LOT OF MOVING PARTS PUTTING THAT'S THAT'S CORRECTIVE NOT. ITO REVEALED WAY TO THE CHANCELLOR'S CERTAINLY WITHIN. THEIR UNIT OR SECTION. I THINK THAT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO DO FOR. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AND. YOU WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER THE. THE SURVEY WAS SENT TO THE CAMPS IS YOU SEE. CALL THE STATE AUDIT STAFF AND THEY TOLD THEM THEY WERE HOLDING A CONFERENCE CALL TO CLARIFY ITS A QUESTION RIGHT. I MEAN IN THE AUDIT STAFF NEVER PROJECT TIME. I'M I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF THAT WAS SUCH A GROSS VIOLATION OF PROCEDURE TO WIDEN. YOUR SENSE OF WHY HONORED IN JACK. WOULD YOU SAY THE STATE AUDITOR OR THE OR THE INTERNAL AUDITORS I THINK THAT WAS THE MEETING THAT. WHAT SORT OF CAMPUS WIDE CHAIRED BY THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACTING COMPLIANCE BY SISTER MAGICS DEMANDING AND I HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK? SAID KITTY CARDENAS WAS SHE MEN AND PART OF THE STATE AUDITOR. SHE MIGHT HAVE IN THE THE CONTACT A LOT ABOUT POSITIVE BUT I THINK THE TELEPHONE CONFERENCE YOU'RE REFERRING TO WAS INTERNAL. WITH THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACTING COMPLIANCE OFFICER IN EACH OF THE. CAMPUSES THAT THAT PHONE BEEN. THAT I THINK. THERE WAS CONTACT BETWEEN THE UC. ACTING COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND. CARTOONIST FROM THE STATE AUDITOR SO IN THAT SENSE THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION THAT. THE. ARE YOU SEE AUDITOR'S. INTERNAL. HOWEVER LET HAVE LEFT THE STATE AUDITOR CONTACT NO. THAT THEY WERE HAVING THIS. A CAMPUS WIDE RANGE SORT OF TOTAL CONFIDENCE SOME LOOKING AT APPENDIX A. OF THE REPORT PAGE FOUR AND IT IS THIS LOW SUBHEADINGS HAVE HICKS EMAIL STATE AUDIT STAFF. AND IT JUST TALKS ABOUT HOW THERE WAS A DIRECT OUTREACH TO THE STE TO STAFFORD STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AND I I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. IF THAT IF IF IF. WHAT DO YOU SEE WAS DOING IN TERMS OF HAVING THIS CALL AND HAVING PEOPLE HAVE A CONVERSATION GET QUESTIONS ANSWERED? YOU KNOW I'M GETTING GAUGE AND. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW IF IF IF IF THE AUDITOR NEW THAT THE ABOUT THIS CALL AND. I I GUESS I'M I'M I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH. THE. WITH WITH WITH IT AFTER THE FACT. RESPONSE TO. THESE EFFORTS. THAT IF IT WERE REALLY SO OUTRAGEOUS ANYWHERE SO FACIALLY. IMPROPER IMPROPER. WHY WOULD IT WHY WHY WOULD THE STATE AUDITOR NOT HAS RAISE ANY OBJECTIONS WHEN THE ROOM FORM HILL AYE I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER THAT IS IS A A CURIOUS SITUATION ONE COULD ARGUE THAT? WELL THE STATE AUDITOR KNEW FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THAT THIS. SYSTEM WIDE. CONFERENCE. CALL. WAS TAKING PLACE OR HAD TAKEN PLACE. TO RESPOND TO ANY. QUESTIONS. THAT THE INTERNAL. CAPS AUDITOR'S OF HAD. SO THAT DOES SUGGEST I THINK IS YOUR INFERRING THAT WELL MAYBE THE STATE AUDITOR NEW. OR LEAST ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES NEARLY AS ON NEW. PREDICT THAT INFORMATION IS BEING SHARE FILE AND I DON'T THINK. SUBSTANTIVE. RESPONSES I WERE BEING PROVIDED JUST MORE. HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE THE SURVEY THAT JUST CAME AND? ONE OF WHETHER IT WAS SIXTY PAGES. SO IS MORE OF A PROCEDURAL. LA FORMAT AS OPPOSED TO HOW DO WE ANSWER THIS QUESTION OKAY OKAY. IMMEDIATE DO YOU THINK THAT THAT FROM YOUR SIN THE CALLERS RESEMBLED YOU THINK IT'S. REASONABLE TO EXPECT ONE PERSON FROM EVERY CAMPUS TO COMPLETE A FIFTY PAGE SURVEY WITHOUT WELL. NOT NOT FOR ME TO SAY BUT GIVEN THE THE BROAD SCOPE OF THE QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S MORE REASONABLE THAT. THEY WOULD DISTRIBUTE THESE OUT TO PEOPLE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE PARA. AND MAYBE THAT WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE NEED TO REALLY KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT. PROVIDING ANSWERS YEAH I GUESS IT'S PART ONE SERVING WITH THE NEEDS OF VERY COMPLICATED SURVEY. ITS LONG SURVEY. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ON CAMPUS WHO IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE ANSWERS. THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TREAT FUNDS JUST GOT IT YOU GOT IT FARMING OUT TO VARIOUS VOTE RIGHT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. ON AND THAT SEEMS REASONABLE AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW. WHO'S ULTIMATELY THE RIGHT PERSON ON CAMPUS CANCERS QUESTION. YOU KNOW ISN'T SHOULD THE CHANCELLOR REVIEW IS THAT WOULD THAT BE. YOU GIVEN THEIR HIS OR HER CENTRAL ROLE IN MANAGING THE. OPERATION. WELL FIRST TASK TO REVIEW UNDER CHANCELLOR REVIEW OBVIOUSLY A CHANCE WAS NOT. HAVE THE DETAILED KIND OF INFORMATION TO RESPOND. QUESTION REGARDING A CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OR. OR PROGRAM THE GUEST RELY ON FROM SUBORDINATES. YEAH OKAY Y. SIGNATURE GOES ON. AND IT HAS HIS IMPRIMATUR. RIGHT GREAT. OKAY WHY I APPRECIATE THOSE ANSWERS BECAUSE I THINK GUN I THINK YOU ARE VERY GOOD I I THINK THAT CONCERN I THINK YOUR ANSWERS ARE ARE VERY FAIR IN THE SENSE THAT THEY REFLECT. THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT WAS BEING ASKED THESE CAMPUSES IN THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH GIVING. FACTUAL TRUTHFUL ANSWERS ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THE FACT THAT TO EXPECTED THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY COMMUNICATION OF COORDINATION WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION THIS IS. IT JUST SEEMS REALLY AND REASONABLE THAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY. WHAT IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE RATHER OVERBEARING ACTIONS TAKEN BY A COUPLE OF? THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF TOP STAFFERS WHO ANDERSON ARE NOW GONE. BUT I THINK AT LEAST IT HELPS TO CONTEXTUALIZE A LITTLE BIT OF THE WAY THE UNIVERSITY. RESPONDED TO THIS. I THINK I'VE EVER HERE I THINK YOU. THANK YOU MR MEDINA BEST FOR FIRST THANK YOU JUST AS MY OWN FOR A VERY THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. AND FOR SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH US. ARE ARE ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY. THE REGION'S OR THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. IN REACTION TO YOUR REPORT. IT ONLY WHAT I WHAT I'VE READ. AND THAT I THINK THE. AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT I THINK THEY'VE ADOPTED ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS I KNOW THAT. AND I THINK WITH RESPECT A TO MY REPORT. I GUESS WE'LL HEAR FROM FROM THE PRESIDENT BUT BY SEN BEN FROM THE CHAIR OF THE REGENTS. A BUT I THINK THEY'VE. THEY'VE TAKEN THAT THE REPORT AND I THINK. VIEW IT TOUGH FAVORABLY. I'VE EVER SURE DOES LIKE CONCLUDED THAT. THE WHOLE IDEA ABOUT. ENGAGING IN THEM THIS KIND OF. SURVEY REVIEW WAS. NOT A GOOD IDEA. OTHER HIGH AND THAT THE. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN AND I FACT I THINK THIS BODY. I AN ACT WITH SOME LEGISLATION REALLY CORRECT. RATTLED PUTTING. RESTRICTIONS ON MAKING IT CLEAR IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE. THAT THE ANY KIND OF INTERFERENCE WITH THE TYPE I DESCRIBED. THAT CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN THE LEASE WITHOUT. THE CONSEQUENCES SO IN YOUR ESTIMATION YOU THINK THEY HAVE DONE SUFFICIENT ACTIONS. TO TO GUARANTEE THAT. THAT KIND OF TAMPERING WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN IT'LL AS FAR GOOD IS I KNOW AND GIVEN THE STATE OF THE LAW I WOULD SAY I THINK THEY'VE LEARNED THEIR LESSON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUSTICE. A MISTER KILEY. DEFINITE JUST RIGHT NOW MOVEMENT. I DON'T ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT. SECTION THREE. SUBSECTION A IN OF THE REPORT WHICH PAGES THAT I THIS IS STARTING NEAR THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIVE. KIND OF GOT. AND YOU DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU CO P. AND THE STATE HONOR IN THE FALL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AS TENSE I EVEN TOXIC. SUPPOSE TO SOME EXTENT IT'S UNAVOIDABLE NO ONE REALLY LIKES AYE BEING AUDITED UMMAH CLOSER LIDO. YOU GO ON TO SAY THAT WITNESSES AT ALL LEVELS OF THE UNIVERSITY REPORTED THAT AT THIS POINT. THE STATE AUDITOR WAS KNOWN TO OVERLOOKED FACTS AND PAINT CERTAIN FACTS IN A MISLEADING LIFE. SO I WITNESSES AT ALL LEVELS OF THE UNIVERSITY COULD YOU PROVIDE SHED A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON HOW MANY FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT ROLES THEY OCCUPIED IN THE UNIVERSITY. IT I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT FLOOR. AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THE OTHER CONCERNS THERE. AND ALSO THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS EXPRESSED TO US THAT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. AS WELL AND I THINK IT ALL ORIGINATED WITH AN EARLIER. SURVEY NAM NOR AUDIT CONCERNING. NONRESIDENT. STUDENTS IN TUITION AND SO FORTH. THAT KIND OF LEFT A BAD TASTE IN THEIR MOUTH SO. WE DIDN'T REALLY GOING TO ALL THAT DETAIL BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF COLLATERAL AND ISSUE THAT PERHAPS SUB BUT HOME. AND THE SCREEN DE DESCRIBES RELATIONSHIP. AS BEING THAT WE HEARD THAT. A NUMBER OF TIMES LOW. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE THAT MOTIVATED. THE COMMENTS AND REVISIONS AND SO FORTH MINUTES THINK MIGHT BE SPECULATIVE TO. THE SAILOR. I OF THE LANGUAGE JUST STRUCK ME BECAUSE IT'S QUITE SIMILAR LATER ON THE REPORT YOU ARE GO OVER THERE. THE GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS YEAH AND. KNOW THAT INTENTIONAL EMISSIONS OR MISLEADING INFORMATION CAN CAUSE THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS TO BE INCOMPLETE OR IMPROPER AND HERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE. WITNESSES AT ALL LEVELS OF THE UNIVERSITY I SAYING BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT OCCURRED THAT THE STATE AUDITOR WAS KNOWN OVERLOOKED FACTS. AND PAINT CERTAIN FACTS IN A MISLEADING Y.. YOU ALSO REVIEW. THE AYE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RELIABILITY OF TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE WHEN IT COMES FROM SOMEONE IN MANAGEMENT ON THE ONE HAND AND WHEN IT COMES FROM AN UNBIASED A KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON ON THE OTHER. NUYS. WITH THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU GOT IN THIS RESPECT INCLUDE. JOB BEING FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FELL ON THAT UNBIASED KNOWLEDGEABLE CATEGORY AS OPPOSED THE MANAGER OF. MONEY MANAGEMENT CATEGORY YOU KNOW THAT'S THE EASIEST BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE. COMMENTS ABOUT RIGHT THE COMMENTS THAT BASICALLY PURPORT THAT THE AUDITOR I WAS NOT VIOLENT FOLLOWING GOVERNOR LISTENING THINKS FOR THE MOST PART THEY WERE CONFINED KIND OF THE. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT FLOOR THAT EXECUTIVE OFFICE. FLOOR BECAUSE I THINK. THEY FELT THEY WERE BEING DILUTED WITH. AUDITOR'S MILLING ABOUT IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND. ASKING FOR HARD DRIVES AND. THIS IS WHAT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT THEY WERE JUST. CONCERNED THAT THERE. BEING TOO INVASIVE RIGHT BUT. THOSE FEELINGS WERE. YOU KNOW CAN CERTAINLY. NEGATIVE FEELINGS CONCERNING THE AUTHOR REALLY REACH BEYOND. JUST THE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE I WOULD. REALLY WITH JUST THE WORKLOAD. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER. THAT THERE'S A CALCULATION THAT SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT. THINK THE AUDITOR GAVE THEM. UNDERESTIMATE THIS ISN'T IT LIKE THE IRS TELL YOU SEEM TO TAKE TWENTY MINUTES. HOW LONG DOES IT REALLY TAKE? HIM TWENTY DOLLARS SOLOS ON THE MAGNITUDE OF MAYBE FOUR TO ONE. OF THAT THE WORK TO RESPOND. ACCURATELY. TO THESE QUESTIONS WASN'T TAKE MUCH MORE TIME THAN. THAT WAS APPARENT AND I THINK THAT WAS THE JUST. OF THE CONCERN. UP AT THE LOWER LEVEL. UP PEOPLE AFTER PROVIDING THE ANSWERS. A HAPPY EXECUTIVE OFFICE LEVEL LOSE MORE. KIND OF. DEMANDING ACCESS THEM. LOVE. PEOPLE MILLING ABOUT A HALF OF THE AUTHENTIC I THINK THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN RIFLE ABOUT PLAN. SO ON THAT. SPECIFIC CLAIM THAT THE AUDITOR WOULD OVERLOOK BACKS AND PAINT SOME FACTS AND MISLEADING Y. DID YOU FIND ANYTHING TO CORROBORATE THAT WELL YOU KNOW WE. I DO WE DIDN'T DO A. THAT ISN'T THAT WASN'T THE FOCUS NOW IS PART OF THE CONTACTS YOU LOOKED ME UP WITH THE TO CONTACT WERE TOLD YOU KNOW. ALL THIS OCCURRED IN AN ENVIRONMENT. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE. HE NOTED THAT. WAS THAT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN OUR IN OUR SCHOOL IN OUR STUDY WE WEREN'T REALLY LOOKING AT THAT THAT WAS. A COLLATERAL THING THAT MAYBE. I GAVE SOME COLOR TO WHAT WAS GOING ON. THERE ALSO I'M A STATEMENT IN HERE THAT. THE OVER ARCHING FEELING WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY WAS THE U. COPD AUDIT WAS POLITICAL. IN NATURE AND. CAN YOU IT IS PROBABLY MORE ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU UNDERSTOOD. POLITICAL IN NATURE TO MEANS. YEAH SO IT. SO THE FACT THAT THE. THE ENTITY WAS BEING AUDIT THE. YOU KNOW. REGARDLESS OF HOW THAT SURVEY MADE COME OUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT HAPPY AND CAN. CONSERVATIVE MAKE POLITICAL HAY OUT OF IT ME THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT. IF I HAD TO GET INTO THE MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SAYING THAT THE UNITED SANTA. BUT THEY'VE FILLED A SUSPICIOUS POLITICAL. IT MAY BE THE TERM WITCH HUNT WAS USED TO ONE POINT. YOU KNOW WE HEAR THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW. RIGHT SO I YOU ALSO. DESCRIBED A LETTER WRITTEN BY CHERYL. BACK OFF ABOUT MILLION LACA. AND SHE WAS UNHAPPY. WELL NUMBER ONE WITH THE FACT THAT YOU SEE IF YOU WERE GIVEN A HEADS UP ABOUT THE SERVICE GOING OUT. BUT THEN YOU SAY SHE LEFT THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND LATER SIGNED HER NAME TO A MEMO TO PRESENT A POTANO DETAILING MOTHER THINGS PRODUCER INTO THE ACTIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE AUDIT. IS THAT MEMO PART OF THE REPORT HERE ACT OR IS THAT THINK OTHERWISE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IT IS NOT A WHICH CERTAINLY. WE WOULD WE COULD MAKE THAT AVAILABLE WITH YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS BUT I DON'T THINK WE. INCLUDED EXCERPTS LA IN THE APPENDIX ATTACK IT EASILY BE OBTAINED. AND HER CONCERNS WERE SIMILAR TO THE ONES YOU ARE DISCUSSED LATER AGAINST AND THEN SHE WAS HAVING ON HER WAY OUT. BECAUSE ALREADY RETIRED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUSTICE. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS OF. THREE CLICK HERE. LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TOUCHED ON SEVERAL ISSUES THAT I WANTED TO. TOUCH ON SO LET'S GO. PERILS AWAITING LITTLE TOO LONG BUT I SAID THAT JUST MARINO THANK YOU OFFER A VERY THOROUGH DETAILED REPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I I JUST A BRIEF QUESTION TO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE THAT WERE MADE RELATIVE TO THE. THE AUDITOR STAFF I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THE YOU KNOW THIS THIS AUDITOR. WHO? I AM BY HOLY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU TO PUT A REAPPOINTMENT. THAT MAYBE HER STAFF AS A LITTLE OVERZEALOUS IN YOUR EXPERIENCE. VERY TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW NO ONE LIKES TO GET AUDITED. BUT. ISN'T THERE A PRESUMPTION THAT WHEN WHEN AUDITOR'S COME IN THAT THEY HAVE A AN IMPLICIT. RIGHT I MEAN EVERYBODY SHOULD BE RESPECTFUL BUT AN IMPLICIT RIGHT TO THE DATA THAT THEY'RE. CHARGED WITH UNDER THE LAW TO TO HAVE ACCESS TO AND THAT. MAYBE THEY NEED TO SAY PLEASE AND THANK YOU MORE OFTEN BUT. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT THE. ABSOLUTELY I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY HAVE TO SAY PLEASE THANK YOU WOULD. ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO RIGHT NICE. YEAH PERHAPS BUT IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT OF THE JOB AND I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT THE THAT THE STATEMENTS HERE. ARE AUDIT STAFF ROAMING THE HALLS THEY FELT CORDON THREAT I'M PRETTY HAD I HAD A. CONTEXT OF IT BOOK OAKLAND HEADQUARTERS UNCOMFORTABLE EVEN CORNERED THREATENED. I I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE THREATENED PART YEAH AND THEY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS OR. OR SOME OTHER REPERCUSSIONS IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE THAT'S ONE FORMER THREATENING OR YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET BEAT UP IN AN ALLEY AND WHICH WHICH IS A. AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE FLIPPANT BUT I'M LOW CORNERED THREATEN MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND IN CONTEXT IS IT. YOUR JOB IS THREATENED YOUR FREEDOM IS THREATENED OR YOUR YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS IT. AND THEN ALSO BEYOND ITS STAFF ROAMING THE HALLS WELL THAT'S WHAT ANA STAFFS DO. IT IF MY RECOLLECTION SERVES ME CORRECTLY WITH WHEN YOU GO WITH THAT SIR. WELL. THEY DON'T SIT IN A ROOM AND SAY PLEASE BRING US ALL THIS INFORMATION OFTENTIMES THEY'VE LITERALLY GO DOWN THE HALLWAY TO THIS OFFICE TO THAT STAFF REMOVE ROOM TO THAT. YOU KNOW PART OF THE BUILDING IS IN THAT WAY IT'S NORMALLY DONE. WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S THAT NORMALLY DONE AND AND I DON'T THINK WE INQUIRE DISLIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BY THREATEN. AND AGAIN WE DIDN'T REALLY. EXPLORE IN DETAIL. THAT. THE THOSE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY PERSONS WHO REPORTED THAT SO SOMEONE CAN SAY I FELT CORNERED AND THREATENED. AND THEY'RE IN AND YOUR EXPERIENCE IS NOT A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CURRENTLY ACTIVE TITLE REMEMBER WELL AND THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH MONEY JUST WAS THE IT JUST STRUCK ME AS WHILE. WE NO ONE SHOULD BE CORDON THREATENED IT CERTAINLY. BUT THEN ITS FOLLOW UP AUDIT STAFF ROAMING THE HALLS. BUT THEN AGAIN THE SALUTE TO THE PHRASE CORNERING PEOPLE. MAN HAS A CONNOTATION TO IT YOU GIRLS ALL VERY SUBJECTIVE DISPARITIES ACTUALLY SAWWHAT WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE MORE COLOR IN CONTEXT BUT NOT YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT IT'S NO PROCEDURE FOR. FOR THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO UNDER THE LAW BUT. I THINK THIS YEAR AS I MENTIONED OF THE FIRST TIME THAT. LEGAL ADVICE WAS SOUGHT. ON ON THE AUDITOR'S ROLE. OF THE RESPONSE WAS HEY. THEY'VE GOT FULL AUTHORITY. TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING. SO THE THE. OF THE UC OP OFFICE KNEW THAT THE SCALPERS VIRTUALLY. UNLIMITED MOVIES OR IS THIS A STATE AGENCY. REVIEWING A STATE AGENCIES I THINK. IF THEY INTENDED TO TO FIGHT THAT BATTLE WAS GOING TO BE A LOSING CAUSE YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION AND THEY'RE ACTING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AND STATE LAW NO. THANK YOU. MR LIVING DID YOU WANT TO GO TO LATIN AMERICA FIRST OKAY. YEAH I THINK YOU JUSTICE. THE THE IN LOOKING AT THE WAY THAT THE. THE AUDITOR AND THE CAMPUS IS ALL BEHAVED. IT. COSMAN REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HAS A STATEWIDE GOVERNING BOARD BUT WE ALSO HAVE. AND MANY MORE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN GOVERNING BOARDS AND THERE ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT INSTITUTIONS AND THAT WAY. YOU SEE IS. DIFFERENT AND IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BUT TIED TO A PARTICULAR TO SEEN. MORE AS A AS A SYSTEM. ORGANISM IF YOU WELL. AND. I THINK THAT THAT THE QUESTION I HAD IN AND. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE INTERNAL SHARING OF A SURVEY THAT SENATOR ALLEN HAD REMARKED ABOUT WHICH YOU KNOW. BOB PERHAPS CAUSED FOR SOME OF THIS CONFUSION. BUT THAT. THE INSTITUTION PERHAPS USUALLY ACTS AS A SYSTEM RATHER THAN AS MANY DIFFERENT CAMPUSES. INDEPENDENTLY. VERY DIFFERENT STARKLY DIFFERENT FROM. THE. BIKINI COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND THAT PERHAPS NOT HAVING. CLEAR DIRECTION WHETHER IT WAS FROM THE AUDITOR PERHAPS THERE WAS KERN OBSTRUCTION FROM FROM THE AUDITOR BUT BECAUSE. THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS NOT USED TO ACTING. HAS THE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT CAMPUSES AND WITH ARE THIS TYPE OF INTERACTION OF THE STATE AGENCY KNOW. THAT BACK HAVE BEEN A CAUSE FOR CONFUSION AND MISCOMMUNICATION THAT UNFORTUNATE WHAT TO US. LET ME THINK I LOVE I AGREE MEAN THERE'S A. THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND I'M NOT REALLY THE EXTRA HOMELESS BUT. THERE'S A CERTAIN NOT AUTONOMY AMONG THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES AND NAY DEPEND ON THE STYLE OF. OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IS IT MORE OF. A REPUBLIC. IS IT THE UNIFIED STRUCTURE THINK YOU'RE HERE HINTING AT THAT. LOVE. SO AND I DON'T KNOW HOW. THAT MIGHT CHANGE OVER TIME WITH WHOEVER'S WELL THE PRESIDENT. BUT HERE CLEARLY THIS WAS A SYSTEM WIDE. SURVEY. THE CAMPUSES RESPONDED INDIVIDUALLY. THEY HAVE THEIR. ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL THAT EACH AT EACH CAMPUS. A BUT I THINK THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THEIR. IN THIS INSTANCE ACTED TO YOU TO UNIFY. THE RESPONSES TO THIS SURVEY FROM ANOTHER INDEPENDENT. STATE AGENCY. SHOULD THIS HAVE BEEN A THIS CONSIDERATION BEEN. PART OF AN AUDIT REQUEST AS TO HOW TO PROVE APPROACH THE INSTITUTION. THAT. YET IS THERE A. POINT OF ENTRY INTO SUCH A SYSTEM OR ARE WE GOING DIRECTLY TO. WHOEVER THAT APPROPRIATE OFFICER MIGHT BE YET EACH INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS WHICH I THINK PERHAPS WOULD BE. MAYBE MORE APPROPRIATE WITH THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE MODEL THEN A UC SYSTEM MODEL BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS OF COURSE HINDSIGHT FOR US. AS WE PREPARE OUR AUDIT SOON IN APPROVED ON. YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE THE CONCERNS THAT I RECALL WAS THAT. ALTHOUGH THE BE. UNIVERSE IS A WHOLE NEW THE AUDIT. WAS COMING IT DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. THERE WERE NOT ANY NOTICE THAT WHAT WAS BEING SENT OUT TO SORT OF SENT TO ALL THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES. WITHOUT ANY SORT OF A. FOR NOTICE. TO THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT IT'S GOING OUT. IT OCTOBER SIXTEENTH OR WHATEVER WHEN OUT. SO. PEOPLE ACTED SURPRISED WHEN IT DID COME OUT AND THEN THAT'S. WHEN THE RECOMMENDATION TABLED LET'S HAVE A CONFERENCE CALL. WHAT WE DO WITH THE SLITS? GET TOGETHER SO WE HAVE SOME KIND OF. WE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT THE CAPSULES MIGHT HAS. WELL WE OF VERY FINE AUDITOR'S AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'LL FIND BUT THEY WILL FIND SOMETHING YEAH. AND IS THIS AN AUDIT TECHNIQUE OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S IT THIS IS JUST A HAPPENSTANCE WE GET ABOUT THE ONE THAT. YEAH DANCER WHAT YOU'RE WRITING THEM. YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE. THE FACT THAT. EVERYTHING IS DIGITAL AND CAN BE RECOVER AND. INITIAL DRAFTS CAN BE. YELLOW LAB DISCOVERED AND AMENDMENTS IT'S ALL. THERE TAKES A LOT OF WORK A. TO PUT TOGETHER. AND I THINK THERE'S ONE INSTANCE. IN MY REPORT. WHERE THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD GO OFF LINE? NOT SEND EMAILS. YOU MAY GO ON TEXT MESSAGING. AND LOW AND BEHOLD. YOU CAN RECOVER THOSE TWO AS WE'VE LEARNED FROM KERN INVESTIGATIONS IN WASHINGTON. THANK YOU JUSTICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUSTICE BRUNO I LIKE TO OF. GET BACK TO. THE SPECIFIC ACTS OF INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE AND WHO EXACTLY COMMITTED THESE SPECIFIC ACTS OF INTERFERENCE. ON A PAGE THREE OF YOUR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY YOU INDICATE THAT. THAT. YOU FIND THAT THE MEMBERS. OF THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE. ENGAGED IN ACTIONS THAT INTERFERED. WITH THE CAPS SURVEY RESPONSES. HIS THE ID RECALL THAT WON'T YES YES. AND. A SPECIFICALLY IF YOU FOUND THAT YOU SEE OP INVITATION FOR ACTS WHICH YOU DESCRIBED EARLIER. AND. AS TO THE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED BUT WHAT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT. THAT THE TWO ACTORS IN THIS. THAT THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THIS. FACT FINDING REVIEW THAT. COMMITTED THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACTIONS WERE A CHIEF OF STAFF SELF GROSSMAN. AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF BERNIE JONES NO THREAT INC. AND IN FACT ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. YOU INDICATE THAT. THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. TOOK. ADDITIONAL ACTION DESIGNED. TO. CULTURE OR INFLUENCE OF. OF SURVEY ANSWERS. AND WIT AND WHICH IN MANY CASES SUCCEEDED IN DOING SO THAT'S RIGHT. SO. WE KNOW THAT. THE THE CHIEF OF STAFF IN THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF COMMITTED THESE SPECIFIC ACTS OF INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE CORRECT. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THINK YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH PROSPECTIVE THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS. IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS. SO I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE. SOME SECTIONS THAT I FOUND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IN IN YOUR REPORT ON PAGE NINE OF YOUR REPORT. YOU TALK ABOUT HOW AND A NOVEMBER TENTH MEETING. AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WITH ONE WITNESS. WHO SPOKE TO INVESTIGATORS DESCRIBE PRESIDENT PAUL TUNNEL AS? QUOTE UNQUOTE VERY UPSET. REGARDING THE AUDIT AND ASKING HOW THE UC OP COULD GET. MORE QUOTE UNQUOTE CONTROL OVER THE SURVEYS IS THAT. YEAH YOU RECALL THAT STATEMENT YES I SEE IT OKAY. AND THEN. THERE WERE CALLS THAT FOLLOWED THAT NOVEMBER TENTH MEETING. BETWEEN THE CHIEF OF STAFF THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF AND CAMPUS ACCEPTED EXECUTIVES ON NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH. AND ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT. SEVERAL PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED AN IMPLICIT MESSAGE CONVEYED ON THE CALLS. THAT CAMPUSES WHO WOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY SURVEY RESPONSES CRITICAL OF YOU CO P.. IT IS THAT CORRECT YES. AND IN FACT TO ONE WITNESS SIR IT WAS CLEAR THAT YOU CO P. WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE SURVEY RESPONSES WOULD REFLECT WELL ON PRESIDENT NEPAL TANA. IS THAT ACCURATE YES. AND FINALLY ON. THE ON THAT ON PAGE TEN OF YOUR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THERE AT LEAST THREE ASSOCIATE CHANCELLOR'S WHO REPORTED. THAT ON NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH ON THE NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH. CALLS THE CONFERENCE CALLS. THEIR CHIEF OF STAFF OR THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. CAUTION THE PARTICIPANTS THAT THE SURVEYS WERE NOT THE PLACE OR FORUM IN WHICH TO AIR DIRTY LAUNDRY. THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT THE OTHER DURING THE. THE DIRTY LAUNDRY. YES MY WAS THAT THAT WAS THE. RECURRENT. PHRASE THAT TO. MORE THAN ONE WITNESS WHO REPORTED. ALSO. I THINK WITH RESPECT TO. CERTAIN PROGRAMS LIKE THE PATH PROGRAM COMES TO MIND. BUT THIS WAS NOT THE PLACE TO AIR GRIEVANCES CONCERNING PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. THAT THOSE. YOUR CONCERNS WOULD BE CONVEYED. SORT OF OFF LINE ON A SEPARATE. A MODE BUTTON. BUT THE SURVEY RESPONSE WAS NOT PLACE. TO AIR THOSE CONCERNS TEARING. AND AND FOLLOWING THAT. CONFERENCE CALL ON THE VERY NEXT DAY. AYE AS INDICATEDON PAGE ELEVEN OF YOUR. REPORT THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH PRESIDENT TO PULL TARA HOSTED A DINNER AT HER RESIDENCE FOR THE CAMPUS CHANCELLORS. IS THAT CORRECT RIGHT YES. AND AT THAT DINNER A ONE AT LEAST ONE SHASTA TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT. PRESIDENT NEPAL TANO ADVISED THE CAMPUS CHANCELLORS THAT THE SURVEY RESPONSES SHOULD NOT BE OVERLY NEGATIVE. IS THAT CORRECT YES NOW. IN YOUR REPORT TO BE FAIR IT ALSO INDICATES THAT PRESIDENT PLATONIC DENIED SAYING THAT. CORRECT. AND AND FINALLY. GOING TO THE UC SANTA CRUZ. AND OUR ACTIONS THEY YOU INDICATED. WERE THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE. OF THE PRESIDENT'S. DIRECT PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT IN. THIS. FINDINGS OF INTERFERENCE. YOU INDICATED ON PAGE TWENTY FIVE THAT ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SECOND PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME NO. CALLED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ CHANCELLOR. AND THE SANTA CRUZ CHANCELLOR DESCRIBED PRESENT NEPAL TANO IS BEING A QUOTE FURIOUS. WHILE PRESIDENT PULL TARA TOLD INVESTIGATORS. THAT DATE ISSUES A MEASURE TELL HIS IT IS AFTER CORRECT YES THAT'S WHAT EACH OF THEM REPORTED. SO. THERE WHAT WHILE YOU CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NOT. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO FIND. DIRECT INVOLVEMENT ON THE PART PART OF PRESIDENT TO PULL TUNNEL THERE THERE THERE THERE SEEMS TO BE. THE CIRCUMSTANCE LARA CIRCUMSTANCES ARE A LOT OF CONTEXT SURROUNDING THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE. AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS THAT FAIR TO SAY YES. AND SO DID YOU EVER ASK THE. DUH CHIEF OF STAFF. WHY? EARLIER THAT THAT CHIEF OF STAFF OR THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF WHY THEY. TOOK THE ACTIONS THAT THEY TOOK INCLUDING THE FOR ACTIONS THAT YOU SPECIFIC ACCOUNT IS AN INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE. ILL. ESSENTIALLY THERE THEIR RESPONSE WAS. YOU KNOW TO ENSURE THAT THEY TOOK THE ACTIONS THEY DID TO ENSURE. THE RESPONSES WOULD REMOVE PROPER SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. RESPONSES WERE ACCURATELY REFLECTED THE CHANCELLOR'S VIEW. OBVIOUSLY BAY STRAYED FROM THAT BUT THEY DENY. YOU KNOW MAKING. STATEMENTS CONCERNING PARA DIRTY LAUNDRY AND REVISING. ANSWERS TO BE MORE FAVORABLE. BUT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES WHEN YOU LOOK AT PARTICULAR. A. EMAIL EXCHANGES. ABOUT THE WRITTEN WORD BELIES. OTHER THEIR TESTIMONY. THE SHOOTING. OKAY THANK YOU JUST RAN OUT REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY THOROUGH REPORT AND AND. TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AS TO WHY. YOU'RE HERE TODAY SCENE IS. THE LEGISLATURE POLICE DURING MY. TENURE THOMAS. FIVE PLUS YEARS NOW. WE HAVE HAD TROUBLE. GETTING THE FACTS FROM YOU SEE. AND THAT EVERY TIME WE CONTINUE TO ASK FOR PARKS. WE FACE SIMILAR ACTIONS THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED IN YOUR REPORT. ON IT HAS REALLY. HE WROTE IT THE TRUST BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE IN YOU SEE AND FRANKLY THE TRUST BETWEEN THE. THE PUBLIC CAN YOU SEE. SO WHILE MY. COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA TALKS ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF SURVEYS. THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE TO THAT WE'RE HERE BECAUSE. THERE IS AN INABILITY TO. WHAT ARE? SO THERE THERE ISN'T AN ABILITY TO. GET THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION. AND. HAS AS YOU SAID VERY CLEARLY THE FACTS ARE. ARE THE FACTS. ON HOW I WAS CURIOUS GIVEN ALL THE INSTANCES MY. THAT THE CHAIR LAID OUT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR. A IT DOES APPEAR VERY CLEAR THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED ARM IN. THE SURVEYS AND INVOLVED IN IN PROVIDING INSTRUCTION AS TO HOW THE SURVEYS. SURE TURNOUT WHY DID YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE. TO. COOPERATE THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED. YOU KNOW. I WAS A TRIAL JUDGE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. OF MANY INSTANCES OF. AS THE TRIER OF FACT. MAKING A DETERMINATION. IN A BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE OR IN CRIMINAL CASES BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AND IT'S. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT I APPRECIATE. YOUR CONCERN. OF. AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU MIGHT SAY THAT. THIS PERSONALLY I SIDE IMPACT REPOSE. BUT I THINK WEIGHING THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES I JUST DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH NARRATIVE. CONCLUDED AT LEAST. I COULDN'T CONCLUDE. AT LEAST. BY PREPONDERANCE. THAT. SHE KNEW WHAT FACTORS THREE AND FOUR. I THINK IT'S FLOOR. OF THE REGION'S AND AND YOU AS A BODY TO DECIDE. THE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT WE REPORTED THE FACTS. AM CONCLUSIONS I'M LIKE I SUBMIT THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY ARGUE DIFFERENTLY. BUT THIS WAS THE BEST THAT I CAN DO THAT AND THEN WE% CHRISTIAN WHICH IS WHY I THINK WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU FOR YOUR FOR DR REACHING KEY FOR TO THE PRESIDENT. YEAH HOME. THAT. I I TYPE MYSELF IN HER POSITION IN THIS IS WHAT I CERTAINLY HAD A CONVERSATION A FEW MONTHS AGO. HOME IT WE ALL AS LEGISLATORS HAVE CHIEF THE STEPS. DART OUR CHIEF OF STAFF IS. PERSON THAT WE PROBABLY. INTERFACE. ALMOST THE MOST IN EACH OF OUR OFFICES THERE HOPING NO INDIVIDUAL. ON THAT AND WE WOULD INTERFACE WITH ANY MORE THAN THAT CHIEF OF STAFF. A AND I DON'T KNOW TOLD HER WE SPOKE I FIND IT. IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE. THAT. THE CHIEF OF STAFF AXED. WITHOUT. DIRECTION FROM THEIR LOSS. THAT'S THAT'S USUALLY WHEN THE CHEAPEST ROCKETS FIRE YOUR. IT. DID YOU BELIEVE FOUR DID YOU FEEL THAT THEY WERE ACTING WITHOUT. DIRECTION OR IT. OR THEY WERE ACTING ON THEIR OWN. IT ARE CLEAR LISTA FACTORS ONE AND TWO THEY WERE ACTING WITH HER APPROVAL AND KNOWLEDGE IN HER. AUTHORIZATION. BUT AS TO THE GIVE AND TAKE. THE REVISIONS RECONSIDER REFRAMING. NO THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT WE FOUND. SORRY NO EVIDENCE THAT WAS DOCUMENTED IN WRITING. THAT SHE KNEW. OF THAT. THOSE. CHANGES. WE'RE BEING OFFERED IS RECONSIDER CONSIDER CHANGE. NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE DIRECTED THAT. THEY DO THAT. CHAU MAYBE THEY WERE STILL BELIEVE THEY WERE SERVING THEIR MASTER. WANTING THE BAKER THE UNIVERSITY THAT LIKE HIKE. SITTING HERE I COULDN'T I COULDN'T TELL YOU YES THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON SHE KNEW. THAT THE DEGREE OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT. SUGGESTED OF THOSE TWO STEPS. SIX EVEN IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW SAY THOUGH THE BRADFORD THAT REALITY TO WHAT WHICH IS COMMON WE WE VERY RARELY KNOW. ALL THE THINGS THAT. OUR STAFFS DO OR SEE OUR CHIEF OF STAFF SABRINA DO. A BASED ON THE APPENDICES BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN. ON. HER HORROR ACTIONS ALIGNED WITH THEIR ACTIONS IN THE SENSE THAT SHE. SHOULD OUT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S. SHE TALKED ABOUT CONTROLLING THE SURVEYS SHE INDICATED THAT HOME. THAT SURVEYS NEEDED TO BE ON THEM WRITTEN IN A CERTAIN WAY TO. TWO IOTA. SHARE INTIMATE THATTHEY NEEDED TERM SORT OF THE BRITAIN IN A PARTICULAR WAY WHICH IS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH HER TO SUBORDINATES. WELL LET ME JUST SAY TWO THINGS ONE PASSED THROUGH TAKING CONTROL. OF I BELIEVE IT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE. LOVE AUDITOR'S PRESENCE IN THE BUILDING THAT. SHE FELT THAT THINGS WERE OUT OF CONTROL ASSEMBLY DID ASK YOUR. YOU CAN ASK HER. GOT WITH THE SECOND THINK THAT YOU'RE THE SAME LITTLE FELLOW SETTING WAS RIGHT IN THE DINNER AND THE DIRECTION TO OUR CHANCES WERE AGAIN HER THAT THE. GOING THROUGH THE SPECIFICS OF YOUR HUNG HER ACTIONS WERE VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH HER STAFF ACTIONS I REMEMBERED THE SECOND YES YOU KNOW. AS I INDICATED THE BEGINNING. THE CHILLING EFFECT. I MEAN EVEN AT THE. SUBORDINATE POSITIONS BELOW THE CHANCELLOR WHEN. PERSON KNOWS THAT THEIR SUPERIOR. IT'S GONNA BE. REVEALING. BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CIRCUMSPECTION. NATURALLY AND I THINK THE SAME THING WHEN. SUBORDINATES LOW WHO ARE WORKING. WITH THE PRESIDENT. THINKER AND AGAIN I'M NOT USE MAYBE IT'S HUMAN NATURE BUT. I THINK THEY'VE. MADE A BELIEVE THE WRAPPING AT HER BEHEST INTERACTIONS WERE CONSISTENT. BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO DIRECT EVIDENCE IN MY VIEW. THAT WOULD IMPLICATE HER AT LEAST IN MY. THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CONFIDENTLY CONCLUDE SHE KNEW ABOUT THOSE. FACTORS THREE. AND FOR. TELL WHETHER AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POST HER WHETHER SHE SHOULD HAVE NEW NO. THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION. BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT. WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW CHIEF OF STAFF ARE DOING AND THEY THINK THEY'RE DOING THINGS AT THE. AT THE BEHEST OF. THEIR BOSS BUT IN FACT THAT. AUTHORIZATION BILL THAT EXTEND. IS NOT THERE ARE CERTAINLY NOT EXPLICITLY. BUT BUT WHICH WOULD YOU AGREE THAT HER HER ACTIONS ALSO SEEM CONSISTENT WITH HER STAFF ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW CURIOUS OVERALL BIG PICTURE I THINK YOU COULD CERTAINLY ARGUE THAT. YOU ONE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING WE'RE TRYING TO IT WE THAT THE SURVEY'S WORTH THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION TO TRY TO GET. FAX NO AND I THINK THE OVERALL CONCERN IS THAT THERE WAS A COVER UP THERE WAS A FABRICATION. THERE WAS A INTENTION TO HOME KEEP THE FACTS AWAY FROM THE AUDITOR INNOCENCE KEEPING THE FACTS WHICH IN THE LEGISLATURE KEEPING THE WAY FOR THE POPULAR. LATE ME NO I CAN'T. I CAN'T AGREE WITH THAT TO THE EXTENT. THE PRESIDENT IS INVOLVED. THAT SHE HAD THAT INTENT LIKE I JUST CAN'T SAY THAT. BUT. I'M LIKE I DID ONE ALONE HOUSE THERE IN GOING THROUGH THE APPENDICES THERE IS ANOTHER. STAFF PERSON I WAS. WRITTEN ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TOM TIMES BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY MENTION THIS INDIVIDUAL IN IN EUROPE SOME PURE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY YOUR THE. ACTUAL REPORT KNOWLEDGE IS YOUR SISTER Y. THAT WASN'T. AND THAT WAS SORT REGARDING MR PROSCRIBED. YOU'VE YOU'VE MENTIONED HIM IN ART AND THEN FRIDAY DEPENDENCIES HE WAS ON A NUMBER OF CALLS HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO TALK TO. A NUMBER OF THE CFO'S AND HE'S MENTIONED OVER AND OVER INDEPENDENCE HE'S KING. DO YOU KNOW WHY HE WASN'T MENTIONED TO KNOW MY MY RECOLLECTION. WAS HE IS A FINANCE GUY YEAH HE'S THE CHIEF AS WELL AS A MUCH SIMPLER. SURVEY. AND I DON'T THINK MEANING THE THE BRUNT OF. OF THE. REVISED RESPONSES IF YOU WILL DEL WITH MORE OF THE. THE SERVICES ASPECT AND NOT THE FINANCIAL. BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU'RE I THINK SAYS EVEN THOUGH HE WAS. REPEATING IN CALLS IN COORDINATION. YOU DIDN'T FIND ANY SITUATION WHERE SHE WAS. CHANGING THINGS ALTERING THINGS DOING DOING SOME ATTRACTIONS HERE IS DEALING WITH THE PROVOST'S PERHAPS DUE TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES OKAY OF HER. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ARM IN IN REGARDS TO THE HOME. CONVERSATION IN WITH THE SANTA CRUZ CHANNELER. HOME IF TWO DIFFERENT. I GUESS VERSIONS OF IT SO HARD YEAH. HEARTENING YOU HAVE TO ONLY TWO PEOPLE SO YOU CAN HAVE A THIRD. YOU DON'T HAVE A THIRD PERSON TO COOPERATE ROOM. HE AND DISCOS BACK TO THE. HOME. PRESENCE ATTENTION I KNOW. MY MY ON MY OTHER COLLEAGUE FROM. DUBLIN ASHES THIS ALREADY. HOME BUT IT DE. BUT DID YOU FEEL THE INTENTION WAS ABOUT. THAT. PHONE CALL BECAUSE FROM FROM THE WAY AND AGAIN IT'S EVERYTHING'S PERSPECTIVE RIGHT FROM WHATEVER ANGLE YOU'RE LOOKING AT PER FROM THE. PERSPECTIVE BASED ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE PITCHING STAFF EVEN. PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR AB. DINNER. HARM. THAT DID IT IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS ON. CONCERN I I DON'T WANT OTHER. YOU'RE MISREPRESENT DETAILS OF NOT JUST CONCERNED. THAT THE. SURVEY RESPONSES MAY HAVE UP THE UNIVERSITY IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT. WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT VICTOR. THE PRESIDENT KNEW ABOUT THE ACTUAL SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSE WAS. CLEARLY. AT LEAST AT ONE LEVEL. AND YOU CAN ASK HER SHE WAS UPSET PAT. BE TRANSFERRED COUNTERMANDED HER. ORDER TO ALL THE CHANCELLOR'S TO SUBMIT THEIR RESPONSE WAS. TO USE YOUR PRE FIRST BEFORE SENDING THEM TO. THE AUTHOR AND THAT WAS NOT DONE. SO. ONE LEVEL. GOD WOULD BE REASON THE DAVID CHIU SOMEONE NOW. BUT AGAIN THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT. IT WENT BEYOND THAT. THAT THERE WAS ANY. KNOWLEDGE ON HER PART. THAT THE ANSWERS. WERE UNFAVORABLE. BUT WHAT IS CLEAR IS AND THIS IS DOCUMENTED. IS THAT WHEN THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. INTERCEDED IN WELL WITH A BACK AND FORTH WITH THE CHANCELLOR. I MEAN IT'S PLAIN AS DAY. THAT THE RESPONSES. CHANGE IN THE MATERIAL WAY. TO REFLECT MORE FAVORABLY. ON ON THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. HOME DID YOU IMAGINE THIS CHEWING. ON THE ACTIONS FROM THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT YEAH IN IN THE CHANCES A PARTICULAR. HOME DO YOU THINK THAT ON THE CHILLY AFFECT HAS ANY LONG TERM ASPECT BASED ON YOUR INTERVIEWS OR DO YOU THINK THAT WAS JUST. ACTUALLY FACT BASED ON THIS ONE. PARTICULAR SITUATION. WELL I THINK I THINK YOU'RE GENERALLY. AS I'VE SAID IF YOU KNOW YOUR BOSS WHO IS BEING AUDITED. IS. GOING TO BE REVIEWING YOUR RESPONSES TO THAT AUDIT. I THINK IT'S GOING TO CHURCH IN HUMAN NATURE TO BE CHILL. AND NOT A GOOD WAY TO BE SO. IN AND EVEN GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SOME OF THE OTHER RESPONSES THAT CAME BACK HAD SOME. FEEDBACK OR YOUR CRITIQUE I GUESS YES. ON THE I SO EVEN GIVEN THAT SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW THE SOMEONE'S LOOKING OVER THERE ARE STILL YEAH. SINCE SOME FEEDBACK THAT WAS GIVEN. SO BABY GIVEN ACTUALLY FACT CLEARLY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT COURTS ARE. TAKE UNDERTAKE SIGNIFICANT BUT A AN AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK WAS CLEARLY. NOT GIVING BACK BECAUSE OF THAT RIGHT. WHERE THEY GAVE INFLICTED THEM MAYBE THREE INSTANCES? WITHOUT ANY KIND OF A BACK AND FORTH. REVISIONS WERE MADE ONCE THE. CAMPUS IN NEW THAT THERE'S GONNA BE YOU COPD REVIEW SORT OF A PREEMPTIVE. REVISION. DO YOU THINK WILL BE. DO YOU THINK THERE IS A LONG TERM IMPACTS IS BECAUSE YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY TALKED TO ALL THE VARIOUS NOT RIGHT I REALLY COULDN'T ANSWER. CREDENTIAL ADMITTED SO MANY PEOPLE PERSONALITIES AT TIMES BOOKS I REALLY TECH COULDN'T REALLY ADDRESS OF LONG TERM EVEN SHORT TERM. I JUST KNOW THAT IN THIS CASE THERE WAS A CHILLING EFFECT OKAY THANK YOU BUT THEN AGAIN I THINK I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE REPORT MEMBERS PERSONAL PLEASURE. WELL THANK YOU I KNOW THAT YOU'VE HAD QUITE OF A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I COME WHAT ABOUT THAT JUST REALLY QUICKLY TO THE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WERE. HEREIN APRIL WHICH WAS NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE NON DISCLOSED. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE BUDGET AND AND THEN WHAT CAME AFTER AS FAR AS THE AUDIT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. AND I WILL PARTICIPATED IN THAT HEARING AND IN THE SPRING WAS A. HOW MUCH WAS REPORTED TO THE REGENTS HOW MUCH DID THE LEGISLATURE KNOW MOUNT THOSE FUNDS AND I THINK THE CONCERN FOR MANY OF US HAS BEEN THAT HOW WE ALL ARE? BELIEVERS IN THE UC ATTENDED. A COLLEGE THERE BUT ALSO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CAL STATES. AND EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE VERY. DIFFICULT DECISIONS AS HOW MUCH EACH INSTITUTION IS GOING TO BE FUNDED SO TEND TO. QUESTION A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AND IS THAT REALLY. SHOULD OF IT AND HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED OR NOT. I THINK FOR ME WAS KIND OF A RED FLAG OF WELL WHY WASN'T THAT AND I KNOW I FELT AS IF A. THAT THAT WAS A SERIOUS A PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED. BUT THEN READING YOUR ANALYSIS AND AS IF YOU WOULD SAY YOU CAN'T COME TO THE ULTIMATE CONCLUSION THAT. ON ALL FOUR ITEMS AND YOU MENTIONED THERE WAS IF YOU WANT TO SAY. DISCUSSIONS EVERYBODY IT DOES CREATE A PATTERN FOR ME MA THAT ONE COULD. INFER THAT. IT JUST PUTTING IT AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE THAT NGUYEN A SURVEY TAKES PLACE IN ONE OF THE BEST. RESULTS POSSIBLE I KNOW. FIFTY QUESTIONS IS QUITE LENGTHY BUT MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOW EVEN. K. TWELVE OR DOING SURVEYS OF FOR THEIR OWN TEACHERS AND A LOT OF MEMBERS BECOME. TEACHERS THEMSELVES DON'T EVEN WANT TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS AFRAID THAT RESULTS ARE GOING TO GET OUT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ANONYMOUS OR IT'S NOT. AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE FEAR. THAT IS IT REALLY GOING TO SHED LIGHT ON WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT THAT'S THE. EXACT POINT OF SOME OF THE SURVEYS IS TO FIND OUT REALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND KIND OF GAUGE IT. BECAUSE IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY FACE TO FACE ON THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO SAY HOW THEY REALLY FEEL BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID AGAIN. THAT MAYBE THEIR BOSS OR SUPERINTENDENT OR IN THIS CASE CHANCELLOR IS GOING TO THINK POORLY OF THEM SO AS I. HAVE LISTENED TO THE QUESTIONS AS I HAVE LOOKED AT THE REPORT. I GUESS THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU DID SAY THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN THE OFFICE. OF. OR USE MENTIONED TO ARE THERE OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW OF OR. YOU SAID THAT ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE MADE I WORK WHAT ARE TAKING PLACE DO YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO ANY MORE OF THOSE ITEMS. I CANNOT BECAUSE I JUST I JUST KNOW BASICALLY WHAT I'VE READ. IT IN PUBLIC CA REPORTS ARE ARE. SO FAR TRACK FINDING. TASK WAS REALLY LIMITED TO WHAT HAPPENED. IN THAT VERY. CONSTRAINED TIME PERIOD. SO SPARSE THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE THE LAWS OF CHANGE I REALLY. HAVE NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST CRIED OUT. HAVE TYPE. MR SHOT THAT'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST FROM THE PRESENTATION HERE. LISTEN ALL QUESTIONS OF. I COLLEAGUES UP HERE. ONE TO PUT THIS IN. VINCE. KIND OF A TIMELINE. SEE THIS ALL STARTED OUT SOME TIME AGO SOME YEARS AGO I THINK. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. SINCE LOT OF SCOTT APPEARANCE TWELVE YEAR WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT TUITIONS. AND WORRYING ABOUT HOW MUCH DE OF US COSTS IN FOR STUDENTS AND HOME FOR ELECTRONIC GOING TO PAY. SO THE QUESTION ONLY FOR MY WHEN MY COLLEAGUES ANYWHERE ASK QUESTIONS OF FELT WE WERE GETTING THEM. THAT'S WHERE THE OUT IT CAME FROM. BECAUSE IN OUR SUB TO MEETINGS WE HAD WE SAY WELL YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE BECAUSE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WITH ALL THE DETAILS. THE. AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE HAVE SECOND WE WHAT WE EACH OF US RANSOM IT TO OUR OWN. THE CHURCH ONE SEES. WHEN THE AUDIT WENT FORWARD. YEAH. AND IT CAME BACK. I'M. IN YOUR REPORT HERE ON THE END OF IT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW EVERYBODY IS INVOLVED. YOU MAKE A STATEMENT ALL THREE INDIVIDUAL STATED THEY DID NOT INTEND TO INTERFERE WITH THE SURVEYS. STAY WITH THAT. AFTER MEGA GOOD. CREDIBILITY. CALLED CERTAINLY AYE THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SKEPTICISM. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE WHETHER OR NOT. THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF AND THE CHIEF STAFF ONE ABOUT THIS BUT AS FAR AS THE. NEPAL CONNOR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU DID NOT INTEND TO INTERFERE WITH THE SERVICE. WELL AS WE'VE DEFINED AT ME SHE DID IN FACT INTERFERE WITH OUR ITEMS ONE AND TWO BUT AS TO THREE AND FOUR. THAT AIRING THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY NEGATIVE RESPONSE MOVES AND AMENDING. WE AYE THERE'S INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO CONCLUDE. SHE EITHER APPROVE SANCTIONED. RATIFIED OF THOSE ACTIONS BY HER SUBORDINATES AND THAT WAS MY IMPRESSION WE HAD THE HEARING I GUESS TO HEARINGS AGO WHEN WE HAD AND EVERYBODY HERE THAT. ANSWER QUESTIONS I I LISTENED TO IT DOWN. WHAT WAS PROBABLY IN EVERYBODY'S MIND ON NOVEMBER THE TENTH TWENTY SIXTEEN? YOU HAVE A COCKTAIL PARTY COMING AND WHAT WAS YOUR REASON MINE. WE JUST COMPLETED ELECTION. WE HAD SOMEBODY JUST ELECTED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. NOW THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON THE TIME AND I WOULD IMAGINE IN THE UC SYSTEM THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING TO BE ON THIS. I DON'T. AND. I WOULD JUST ASK ALL OF US AS WE LOOK AT THIS KIND OF PUT IT IN CONTEXT AND GO THE NEXT RAISES QUESTIONS THAT. WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S CAREERS IN AND THEIR CONDUCT AS THERE IS A DOING VERY DIFFICULT JOBS IN. AND THAT WE'VE HAD. A STATEMENT RIGHT HERE THAT'S. CLEARLY ALIGNED IF SOMETHING HAD TO BE CORRECTED IT WAS COUPLE PEOPLE REMOVED. WISDOM THE OTHER ACTIONS LATER ON ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS MONEY OVER TO DO WITH IT. BUT WE EVERYBODY APPEARS SAYS ARE SUPPORTING THE THE UC'S. AND SO. WE SHOULD NOT. IMPUGN ANYBODY OR MAKE ENDS ABOUT THINGS OR IF I HAD A CHIEF OF STAFF I WOULD KNOW WHERE SOMEBODY WOULD DO THAT BECAUSE. AND DEALING HOW BIG HOW BIG IS YOUR ORGANIZATION READ HOW MANY PEOPLE DISH SHE MANAGE. A BOLT ON. YOU KNOW SHE WOULDN'T SHE WOULD KNOW THE EXACT WITH GIVE ME A BALLPARK ISM IS A MORE THAN SEVEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HELL YEAH GOVERNOR A. A THINK IT ISN'T IT OCCUPIES MORE THAN A ONE FLOOR IN OAKLAND I'M SURE OF THAT YET TONIGHT I COMMANDED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ONE TIME. AND I COULD TELL YOU THINGS GO ON THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE LEVELS AND LEVELS OF THINGS GOING ON SO MIKE AND I CAN CONFIRM THAT WHILE I WAS UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO BILLY'S. I HAD A HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE I COULDN'T TELL YOU. THE NAMES OF EACH AND EVERYONE OR WHAT THEY DID RESPONSIBLE FOR BUT I TRIED. I AGREE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT I THINK IS VERY CLEAR. LAID OUT SOMETHING THAT WAS THERE AND I'M I'VE MEMBER ASKING THE AUDITOR HOW MS IS ALWAYS GOOD. BECAUSE I JUST TO BE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL ST MILITARY SING BECAUSE NOT OUR. WE EGO WHEN TO DO THESE TO MAKE ORGANIZATION BETTER. AND I ASKED HER I SAID IS THE ORGANIZATION BETTER BECAUSE WHAT YOU DID. AND SHE SAID YES. THERE'S A METAL RECORD. AND I SAID THAT'S GREAT. SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A POUND OF FLESH. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT'S BEST FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND THERE'S REGION'S AND RATHER MILLION DO THAT I DON'T KNOW THE LEGISLATORS ARE. THAT'S OUR PER REACHED BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY TWO TESTIMONY. GOING THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. AND OBVIOUSLY. I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT WORK THIS THAT IS TO BE DONE TO GO INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHEN YOU. OF OF AS EVERYONE IS KEEP SAYING OVER AND OVER THAT MY THE INSTITUTION AND WE BY NO MEANS A TALKING ABOUT DESTROYING IT. TEARING APART THE UNIVERSE ITSELF WHEN YOU AND THAT IS NOT AN AGENDA ITEM I THINK FOR ANYONE IN THIS. ON THE STATUS IT YOU KNOW IT IT BECOMES A DIFFICULT TASK TONIGHT IS I SAY THIS TO YOU AS SOON AS TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT. YOU KNOW. MOST OFFENSES SOME BEGIN OFF AS BIG THINGS WOULD BEGIN AS LITTLE THINGS. AND AND THEN THEY BLOW UP YOU KNOW AND THEY CONTINUE TO GROW. AND. YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN A TRIPLE BREWING ALL MY DEGREES ME SILLY YOU I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION BUT ALSO KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. ARE VERY RESEARCH ORIENTED INDIVIDUALS. AND THEY UNDERSTAND SURVEYS. DAMN STAND WITH THEIR ABOUT THROW AND THEY KNOW THAT THEIR OWN INSTITUTION THAT THE VALUE THAT INSTITUTION RIDES ON THEIR ABILITY TO DO EXCELLENT RESEARCH. AND TO BE HONEST IN THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND REPORTING OUT OF INFORMATION. PEOPLE'S WHOLE CAREERS ARE DESTROYED IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD BECAUSE THEY FALSIFIED DATA WILL% ALTER INFORMATION AND SO THIS IS NOT JUST A MOM AND POP OPERATION THIS IS UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. THESE A PERSONS WHO HAVE PROBABLY SOME OF THEM HAVE LONG EXTENSIVE CAREERS IN ACADEMIA. AND HAVE COME TO GO. TO RISE TO BE A PART OF THIS SO I WOULD WANT US TO DISMISS THE FINDINGS. IN IN MAY THAT REQUIRE A TWO MINUTES ACTION ON OUR PART. BUT UP WE SHOULD NOT IN ANY WAY DIMINISH THE SIGNIFICANCE. ALTERING SURVEYS. AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND AND AND I'M HAVING A CHILLING EFFECT ON INDIVIDUALSWHO ARE PART OF THE INSTITUTION WHO HAVE SOME INFORMATION PRESENT. AND FEEL THAT THE OF THE PRESENTATION OF THAT INFORMATION COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES. SO I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S COMMENTS I AND YOU KNOW AND AND I'M I'M NOT SURE WHERE THIS IS WILL IN AT THE END BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE PROCESS OF SURVEYING. DATA COLLECTION HONESTY IN THAT IN THAT BAND THAT INFORMATION IS REALLY WHAT DETERMINES EXCELLENT UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. BUT ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE TELL YOU IS NOT GOING TO FLY AS A RESEARCH INSTITUTION. AND MOST OF THE TIME THOSE INSTITUTIONS GET THEIR GRANTS BASED ON THE HONESTY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FACULTY AND THE MEMBERS WHO DO RESEARCH. AND A OTHERWISE YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAYS WHERE THIS CAME FROM STANFORD THIS RESEARCH CAME UCLA OR UC BERKELEY THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO'S READING THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO BACK INTO THE RESEARCH THEMSELVES. SO HIS REPUTATION OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS IN THE QUALITY OF THAT RESEARCH THE DETERMINES THE VALUE OF IT IN ANY DISCUSSION. SO I WANT IS TO MINIMIZE THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND INFORMATION AND THOSE WHO COLLECTED BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PREMIER RESEARCH INSTITUTION. NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS NATION BUT IN THE WORLD. AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER. REQUESTS. JUSTICE MARINO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR SERVICE THANK YOU AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO. INDIVIDUALS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF WERE. HAVE DEPARTED. THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER IN QUESTION I THINK RETIRED. AND THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE. OF SANTA CRUZ. DIALOGUE IS ALSO RETIRED. I THINK YOU. NEXT WE WOULD LIKE TO. INVITE AND WELCOME. GEORGE KEEFER CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS MR KIEFER WELCOME FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I'M GEORGE KEEFER CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. I WAY BACKGROUND I'M. FORMER ALUMNI REGION AS WELL MANY MANY YEARS AGO. TOO MANY YEARS AGO. FORMER CHAIR THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND. FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION AT UC SANTA BARBARA AND NINETY FOUNDATION AND I CO FOUNDED THE. COMMITTEE COLLEGE FOUNDATION. THAT A PREVIOUS APPEARANCE FOR THIS JOINT COMMITTEE FORMER REGENTS BOARD CHAIR MONICA LOZANO. COMMITTED UNDERTAKING THE BOARD'S OWN REVIEW OF FACTS FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS BY THE STATE AUDITOR THAT ACTIONS BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AMOUNTED TO A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO BIAS CAMPUS SURVEY RESULTS. WE PROBABLY HELD A SPECIAL BOARD MEETING AND THAT YOU'VE HEARD RETAIN JUSTICE MARINO IN THE LAW FIRM OF HOUSTON HAD AGAIN TO DO AN INDEPENDENT FACT FINDING. FOR THE BOARD. AS YOU'VE ALSO HEARD THAT REPORT CONFIRMED INTERFERENCE OF VARIOUS KINDS HAVE VARIOUS LEVELS WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND THAT IN TURN REYES DEEP CONCERN SHOCK ANGER. AND DISAPPOINTMENT AMONG BOARD MEMBERS INCLUDING ME. IN OTHER WORDS WE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY. BRIDGET WAS ON I RECOMMENDED VARIOUS FOLLOW ON ACTIONS TO THE FULL BOARD AS A RESULT OF THOSE FINDINGS. AND OUR NOVEMBER BOARD MEETING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE HEARD. EXTENSIVELY DEBATED AND VOTED UPON FOLLOWING ORAL PRESENTATION. BY AND DISCUSSION WITH SOME QUESTIONS TO THE MARINO HOUSTON HANNIGAN TEAM. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS WERE APPROVED BY THE BOARD AT THE NOVEMBER MEETING AND MULTIPLE CHANGES TO THE BY LAWS AND POLICIES WERE APPROVED AT THE RECENT JANUARY MEETING. HAVING RUN OUT OF TIME TO FULLY CONSIDER THOSE AT THE NOVEMBER MEETING. ACTIONS TAKEN REGARDING DISCIPLINE AT THE NOVEMBER MEETING WERE AS FOLLOWS. ONE A PUBLIC STATEMENT BY ME AS CHAIR ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD ADMONISHING THE PRESIDENT FOR HER ACTIONS IN DIRECTING THE PRESIDENT. TO EXAMINE THE CULTURE WITHIN HER OFFICE THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED. TO THE FAILURE OF OTHERS IN MEETING THEIR RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES. TWO REQUIRING AT THE SAME TIME A PUBLIC STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT. ACKNOWLEDGING RESPONSIBILITY AND APOLOGIZING FOR HER ACTIONS. DISCIPLINE THIRD DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS WERE TO BE RECOMMENDED REGARDING THE CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE PRESIDENT BUT WERE RENDERED MOOT DUE TO HIS RESIGNATION. AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS WOULD BE RECOMMENDED REGARDING THE DEPUTY CHIEF STAFF EQUIPMENT RENDERED MOOT BECAUSE OF HIS RESIGNATION. FOLLOWING THE MEETING THE FULL HOUSTON. PENTAGON MORENO REPORT WAS MADE PUBLIC. AND PRESIDENT NOT I CONDUCTED A PRESS AVAILABILITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. AS NOTED MULTIPLE RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO THE BY LAWS WERE APPROVED AT THE RECENT JANUARY MEETING WE HAD DETERMINED. THAT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE INTERFERENCE RELATED TO THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BOARD. AND OFFICERS WITH DUAL REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE BOARD. AND ALSO CLEAR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE GENERAL COUNSEL IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THE CHANGES TO THE BYLAWS AND BOARD POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PREVENT FUTURE INTERFERENCE WITH STATE AUDITS. RESET THE AUTHORITY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF DUAL REPORTS. IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE AUDITS OF THE OFF OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. AND RESTRAINT IN THE REPORTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE GENERAL COUNSEL ON THE BOARD AND THE CHIEF AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND THE BOARD. MORE SPECIFICALLY THEY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING PREVENTING THE DIRECTOR IN HER DIRECT INTERFERENCE WITH STATE AUDITS THE FUTURE. ENSURING THAT OFFICERS WHO REPORT TO BOTH THE BOARD IN THE PRESIDENT PERFORM THEIR DUTIES TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE BOARD. WHEN THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT IS SUBJECT TO AN AUDIT. AN EXPLICIT DUTY OF ALL DUAL REPORTS REPORT TO THE BOARD ANY SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AT ANY TIME. WHETHER AS PART OF AN AUDIT WERE GENERALLY. REQUIRING DIRECT THE EQUAL INVOLVEMENT BY THE BOARD IN THE HIRING. COMPENSATING AND EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY DUAL REPORT. WE EXPECT TO FURTHER ENSURE THIS BY REQUIRING REGULAR ONE ON ONE MEETINGS WITH THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF BOARD CHAIR AND THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND THE BOARD CHAIR AND THAT WATCHER OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE THOSE MEETINGS ARE SET. I MEET NOW WITH THE THE. GENERAL COUNSEL EVERY OTHER MONTH AND WITH THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER EVERY QUARTER. BESIDES ALL OF OUR NUMEROUS REGULAR BECAUSE THESE ARE SET ASIDE FOR. ONE ON ONE DISCUSSIONS OPEN NO JANET YOU TALK TO ME. I TALK TO YOU. FOLLOWING MY DISCUSSIONS WITH ASSEMBLY BUDGET CHAIR TING AND UPON HIS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE EARLIER HEARING. THE BOARD RETAIN THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES OF THE CHAU BERG EVER SHANK CONSULTING FIRM HEADED BY THE FORMER STATE AUDITOR. AND CHIEF DEPUTY STATE AUDITOR. THEY ARE LOOKING AT POSSIBLE DUPLICATION OF WORK AS BETWEEN THE SYSTEM OFFICE AND CAMPUSES. AS WELL AS REVIEWING WITH THE CAMPUS IS THE SERVICES PROVIDED THIS WILL GET AT SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO THOSE PROPOSED IN THE AUDIT SURVEYS. WE EXPECT THE HAVE THE SCHOBER GIVE A CHECK REPORT BY THE END OF APRIL. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS IN ADDITION TO A SEPARATE EXAMINATION YOU MAY READ ABOUT BY THE HURON EDUCATIONAL CONSULTING GROUP. COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT TO REVIEW THE STRUCTURE OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THE BOARD HEARD A PRESENTATION BY HERE ON AT ITS JANUARY MEETING AND ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF CONTINUING EXAMINATION. BY THE BOARD. THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD OF HAD NUMEROUS. I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF CONSTRUCTIVE MEETINGS AND PHONE CALLS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR. I HOPE AND BELIEVE WE HAVE FORMED A BASIS FOR CONTINUING CANDOR AND TRUST. SHE HAS MY CELLPHONE AND I HAVE HERS IN THE EVENT THAT EITHER OF US SEE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE BOARD LEVEL. I WANT TO THANK HER INNER STAFF THE ADVICE THEY HAVE GIVEN US. AS WE ADDRESS THE BY LAW AND POLICY CONCERNS. I'VE ALSO HAD MEETINGS WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S TING AND MCCARTY ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE CHAIR MEDINA. SENATE EDUCATION CHAIR ALLEN ADDITIONAL PHONE CALLS WITH BUDGET CHAIR TAKING AND CONVERSATIONS ARE MEETINGS WITH MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. I HOPE TO HAVE FURTHER DIALOGUE WITH THOSE WITH WHOM I HAVE NOT YET HAD THE OPPORTUNITY MEET. AND TO CONTINUE MANY FULL DISCUSSIONS WITH THOSE WHO I HAVE MEANT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S A WHAT IS WIDELY CONSIDERED. TO THE BEST SYSTEM OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION THE WORLD. WE CAN BE PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE BUILT. BUT WE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OR THE BOARD OF REGENTS CERTAINLY DID NOT BUILD IT ALONE. FROM ITS FOUNDING IT WAS A PARTNERSHIP AMONG THE STATE GOVERNMENT. CIVIC LEADERS AND ACADEMICS. PERHAPS IT DERIVES FROM BOTH THE ROMANTIC ON MY PART PRACTICAL DEEP APPRECIATION AND RESPECT FOR BOTH HISTORY AND GOVERNMENT. BUT I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE DEEPLY IN THE NECESSITY OF THAT PARTNERSHIP. AND THE TRUST REQUIRED TO DO AS WELL IN THE FUTURE AS WE HAVE DONE. IN THE PAST. THIS IS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR ALL NATIONAL PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. AS WE GRAPPLE WITH DEMAND. RESOURCES COST. AND FRANKLY PURPOSE. FOR OUR PART WE MUST BE AS CANDID OPEN AND TRANSPARENT AND RESPONSIVE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE MUST EMBRACE THE OVERSIGHT ROLE OF STATE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE STATE AUDITOR. AS WE ALL RECOGNIZED RESPONSIBILITIES TO TOMORROW AS WELL AS TODAY. AS IMPORTANT AS MEANS. HONEST AND RESPECTFUL SHARING OF RESPECT FOR THE RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG US. VIEWPOINTS AND IDEAS MUCH JUST DID THE CIVIC AN ACADEMIC AND GOVERNMENT FOUNDERS OF THIS UNIVERSITY FIFTY HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO. AS CHAIR OF THIS BOARD OF REGENTS I BELIEVE WE'RE PREPARED TO DO THIS WORK. RESPOND MORE QUICKLY. LISTEN MORE CAREFULLY AND ANSWER MORE FULLY TO OUR PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVES. AS AND THE PUBLIC AS A WHOLE. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU. S. THE END OF MY REMARKS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER KEY FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM MAYBE. MS BAKER. THINK YOU MISTER KIEFER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR AFTER BEING HERE AND FOR BEING A REGION. AND AND MAKING YOURSELF AVAILABLE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND I CLEAN THE CHURCH YOU MENTION OTHER MEMBERS AND TO THE AUDITOR. I GIVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND REALLY TRYING TO CHANNEL MY CONSTITUENTS IN HER HER. AND AND FELLOW ALUM. YOUR TIE CAN DEFINITELY BE INTERPRETED AS AT LEAST THREE EUSTICE COUPLES. I'M GONNA GO WITH A COW MIGHT BE IS STILL AND NOT SURE. FIRST IT GOES TO AYE I'D LIKE TO ASK IF IF THERE REGION'S. IF YOU SAW PRESENT APOLLO'S TESTIMONY TO PASS. WHEN THE AUDIT CAME OUT AND WE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE. I ASKED IS DO YOU JUSTICE MARINO THIS THE SAME QUESTION AS WELL BUT I'M CURIOUS IF THE REGENTS DID. I DON'T KNOW OF ALL THE REDUCE IT I I CERTAINLY SAW A LOT OF IT. AND AND PERHAPS NOT ALL. BUT. AND THE REASON I'M ASKING IS BECAUSE I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU I DID NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WAS FORTHRIGHT. WITH US IN THAT TESTIMONY I'VE GONE BACK MULTIPLE TIMES AND LOOKED AT THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF INTERFERENCE BECAUSE IT IS SO CENTRAL TO OUR ABILITY TO. FIND OUT HOW WE CAN. DO BETTER BY YOU SEE NOT JUST WITH FUNNY BUT IMPROVEMENTS. AND I JUST FLAT OUT ASKED DO WORK WHERE THERE SURVEYS RECALLED AT YOUR DIRECTION AND THE ANSWER WAS NO. AND WHAT CONCERNS ME IS AN ONLY WHAT CAME OUT HAVE THAT THIS REPORT AND THE WHOLE INCIDENT BUT WAS THE CONDUCT TOWARDS THE LEGISLATURE EVEN AFTER THE FACT. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL REGIONS TO GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD AND REBUILD CREDIBILITY. IT'S NOT JUST THE DISAPPOINTMENT AND WHAT HAPPENED TO BEGIN WITH. AND WE JUST HEARD FROM THE THE JUSTICE THAT TWO OF THE FOUR. AREAS THAT WENT OFF OF THE PRESIDENT HE JUST IS QUITE CERTAIN SHE WAS INVOLVED IN ITS IT IS CAN CONCLUDE ON THE THREE AND FOUR. ITEMS BUT. THAT ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN. IN MY VIEW REASON TO TO KNOW TO TURN THE PAGE AND I DO THINK THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TURN THE PAGE AND LEADERSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT. BUT NOT BEING FORTHRIGHT WITH THIS LEGISLATURE IS ALSO AN ISSUE. AND SO THAT IS AN ASK FIRST OF ALL THAT THAT I REALLY RECOMMEND. THE NEXT IS. WHEN THE REPORT CAME OUT. AT THE END OF REPORT THERE WAS. EXTENSIVE I THINK ABOUT FOUR FIVE HOURS OF CLOSED SESSION THAT THE YOUR REGION'S HAD WITH PRESIDENT APOLLO TIME NOW BUT THERE IS. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY VIRTUALLY NO. QUESTIONING IN PUBLIC OF THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE INTERFERENCE THERE'S NOTHING FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE. AND C. CANDIDLY HER EXPLANATION. IF IT WAS DIFFERENT WHEN I WAS TO THE LEGISLATURE WAS IN THE EVIDENCE. AND I'M WONDERING WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE FOR THAT I CERTAINLY KNOW A LOT OF CLOSE SESSIONS TEND TO BE MORE PERSONNEL RELATED. YOU KNOW PRIVATE OR MAYBE LEGAL MATTERS AND AND COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WHY WAS THAT CAN YOU I MIGHT NOT SO Y. IT WITH THEIR WRISTS. QUESTIONING IN PUBLIC AS I RECALL ABOUT THE INTERFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND. MAYBE IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT WE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. DIFFERENTLY AS WELL OUR FOCUS WAS IN THOSE FIVE HOURS TIME WHICH INCLUDED THE REPORT BY HOUSTON HAD TAKEN MARINO. IT WE INCLUDED ALSO. QUESTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT AND STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT TO US THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND TO US AND. LOST TO HIM. AND THEN OUR OWN DEBATE. WE LOOKED AT IT AS A PERSONNEL MATTER. ON A SERIOUS PERSONAL MATTER THAT. JUST THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL. ARE FOR US TO GET OUT. WOULD BE QUESTIONS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE FOR A CLOSED SESSION. WE DID HAVE A. AS I SAID I'VE. READ A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD ADMONISHING THE PRESIDENT WHAT YOU DID TO HAVE BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS IN THE NEWSPAPER AND SHE. BREADED STATEMENT APOLOGIZING. SO I'M NOT. SURE WHAT WOULD BE A GAINED BY FOG. A PUBLIC THE PUBLIC. DISCUSSION OF THAT BECAUSE WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO DEEPER THAN THE SURFACE LEVEL. BUT IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS WE WELL UP WE WOULD CONSIDER. AND MIGHT HAVE CONSIDERED YEAH AND I APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW THAT I GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHATEVER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WOULD NEED TO BE ASKED. TOTALLY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE REGION'S TO DO AND AND WHETHER TO MAKE IT OPEN OR CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC IT IS AS WELL BUT. GIVEN HOW TRANSPARENCY HAS BEEN SUCH AN ISSUE WITH THIS AUDIT AND THEN THE INTERFERENCE AND PREVIOUS AUDITS. THAT JUST MADE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR. USE MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS TO FEEL LIKE THEY COULD READ REAR IN THE TRUSTBUT LET ME DID I I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THAT IMMEDIATELY UPON. ACTING AND I IT FROM THAT CLOSE SESSION AND THEN REPORTING ON OUR ACTIONS AND THE ACTIONS THAT WE WERE TAKING. JUST AS WE DID AT THE JANUARY MEETING. WHICH WAS OPEN SESSION. WE DID RELEASED THE ENTIRE HOUSTON HAD AGAIN REPORT TO THE PUBLIC AND HAVE A PRESS AVAILABILITY. I WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT A FORMER CHAIR LOZANO WAS QUESTIONED AND THE PRESIDENT WAS QUESTION PUBLICLY. BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. AND I. I KNEW IT'S A PERSONNEL MATTER THAT YOU SEE IS INDEPENDENT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THAT INDEPENDENCE IT SHOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WE HAVE WORK TO DO TO SUPPORT YOU SEE. BUT I I I ASK THIS NEXT QUESTION NOT TO BE FLIP BUT IT. WITH THE WE JUST HEARD THAT THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF RETIRED OR NOT FIRED. AND THE PRESIDENT. IT HAS BEEN HAS APOLOGIZED AND UC REGENTS HAVE SAID HOW MUCH THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED BUT IS STILL PRESIDENT AND THERE'S A REAL LACK OF TRUST ME WHAT. I I'M SURPRISED WHAT ALMOST HAS TO HAPPEN YOU SEE FOR THEIR TO BE A CHANGE IN PERSONNEL AND I. BECAUSE THIS IS TO ME SERIOUS AND I'M NOT ASKING FOR A POUND OF FLESH. BUT FOR REBUILDING THAT TRUST I REALLY DO BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO TURN THE PAGE. AND I. I HOPE YOU SEE WILL CONSIDER THAT I HOPE WE WON'T HAVE A REPEAT OF ANY OF THESE POINTS THAT WE WON'T BECAUSE IT. BUT THAT. THAT IS. THAT IS A A GREAT CONCERN IS IS ESPECIALLY AS AS MEMBER WEBER MENTIONED ACADEMIC INSTITUTION AND THE CREDIBILITY IS SO VERY CENTRAL. AND. THESE WHOLE SERIES OF THAT'S UNDERMINE THAT. YEAH I I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE DOUBLE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON. TO WHAT DEGREE. WE TURN THE PAGE AND HOW REFER TO THOSE. THOSE WORDS I WHETHER THEY'RE POUNDS OF FLASHER PAGE TURNS. TOM. A LOT OF THINGS. WENT INTO OUR OWN DECISION ABOUT THAT. AND PART OF IT IS THE CONTACT IS AN ENTIRE SET OF. CONTEXTUAL POINTS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN. THE REPORT BY HOUSTON HANNIGAN MORENO. AND TOUCHED ON. THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S ADVICE. RESPECT TO THE. THE AUTHOR THE AUDITOR HAD SAID. I MONTH AND THERE'S A DEAD THERE'S A STATUTE IT DOESN'T PERMIT DISCLOSURE BUT APPLIED TO HER NOT TO THE. TO THE UNIVERSITY SO HIS ADVICE WAS CORRECT ON THAT. BY IT WAS HE ALSO SAID I SEXY NO REASON THAT THESE CANNOT BE SHARED. YOU KNOW WITH THE SYSTEM. AND AND SO ALTHOUGH THAT HE ALSO POINTED OUT WAS PROBABLY A POLITICAL CHOICE WAS NOT BE A WISE ONE. SO BUT THERE WAS CONFUSION AND THAT WENT THROUGH THE DEPUTY. CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE PRESIDENT. WE HAD THE CONTEXT OF THE PREVIOUS AUDIT. WE HAD. A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AT THAT TIME I COULD LIST I SORT OF A BECAUSE I I I THOUGHT SOMEONE WOULD ASK THIS QUESTION SOME WAY. AND AND NOT IT WAS. FAIRLY UNANIMOUS THAT AND IN FACT I WOULD SAY WAS I I DON'T SEE THERE'S ANY OBJECTION BET THE PRESIDENT CONTINUE. BUT WE HAD TO ALSO DETERMINE A WAY TOO SOON TO MAKE A MARK ON WHAT THAT HOW SERIOUS THAT WAS AND AND AND. THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE DID THAT PROPERLY OR NOT WE THOUGHT WE DID IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. WE STILL HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PRESIDENT. AND THAT THE PRESIDENT INTELLIGENCE AND AND DILIGENCE AND AND AND DR. CAN CAN BENEFIT THAT UNIVERSITY. ITEM. WE BELIEVE WE WILL. THAT WILL TAKE PLACE OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE GONE WE WOULD HAVE TURNED THE PAGE. ON BOTH BUT THAT'S HOW WE CAME OUT ON IT. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANTED TO PUT INTO PROCESS IN INTO INTO AFFECT A LOT OF PROCEDURES THAT WE THINK WILL MINIMIZE THE KIND OF CONTEXTUAL THINGS THAT. THAT ADDED TO THE TO THE SITUATION THE FACT THAT NOT A DIRECT REPORTS THE DOOR REPORTS WERE. TALK TO THE BOARD ABOUT IT. THESE KIND OF THINGS. WORKED WHERE WHERE WE'RE CORRECTING. PEOPLE AS I THINK PEOPLE FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT IT WHILE WE WERE PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WITHOUT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU AND I I I DO BELIEVE IN GRACE AND FORGIVENESS AND I I DO BELIEVE SPECIAL FOLKS OF APOLOGIZE. IT HELPS WHEN THERE'S FORTHRIGHTNESS. YOU'VE BEEN DILIGENT AND I JUST SHARE THE SENTIMENT OF CONSTITUENTS I SEE ALMOST ON DAILY BASIS THAT. THEY REALLY WANT TO SEE A CHANGE AND TRUST RESTORED WE WANT TO WE NEED TO DO OUR PART AS A LEGISLATURE. AND. I HOPE WE CAN CAN CONTINUE TO PARTNER ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME KEEP THAT IN MIND. AS YOU'RE GOING FORWARD AS WELL THANK YOU. GIVE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SAYING NONE. THANK YOU UP YESTERDAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FADEN THANK YOU MISTER OR BOARD CHAIR FOR BEING HERE THAT. I THINK ABOUT MY. COLLEAGUE FROM DUBLIN SORT OF CHARACTERIZED. ON THE THE BROADER CONCERN AND I THINK WE'VE HAD DONE NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SAME ISSUE GROUP. REGARDING. REALLY THE TRUST FACTOR. ON MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM OCEANSIDE MENTIONED EARLIER WE'VE. PRO AND WE SAT FROM WHEN WE FIRST STARTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ON THE. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR EDUCATION SO WERE VERY. VIABLE FIRST AND HOME. ALL THE VARIOUS HIGHER EDUCATION ISSUES AND ALL THE ISSUES AROUND YOU SEE. HOME THAT THE ISSUE AND I DON'T I TRUST THIS WITH JUSTICE MARINO WASN'T JUST A. JUSTICE AUDIT THIS AUDIT WAS A SNAPSHOT AN EXAMPLE OF THE SITUATION THE OVERALL A LARGER SITUATION IS WHEN AND IF YOU CAN ADDRESS IT TO SORT OF ASSURE US THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS. THE. VERY DIFFICULT TIME WE WOULD HAVE GETTING. INFORMATION DATA. A FAX WHOM IN THIS OUR AUDIT IN WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS AUDIT WAS JUST A SORT OF A PARALLEL STORY TO NOT. SEE YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE PUT ON. PROTOCOLS IN PLACE N AND TO ENSURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN IN RESPECT TO THE HONDA CAN YOU ALSO. UP PROVIDING STILL SHIRTS WAS JUST WITHIN THE RELATIVE HER COURSE OF BUSINESS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE UNIVERSITY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A FEE OF VERY KEEN AWARENESS ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS. ABOUT THE NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THIS BODY TO THE LEGISLATURE NAM AND OBVIOUSLY TO PUBLIC. PEOPLE. I AM CONCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY BELIEVE THEY THEY ARE GENERALLY RESPONSIVE. AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE ANECDOTAL. POINTS ON ON BOTH SIDES. ON THAT POINT. I THINK WITH THE MOST. AND FACT I'VE BEEN TOLD WITH THE MOST TRANSPARENT OPEN UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE MAYBE PARTICULAR. MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE HAD PARTICULAR ISSUES WITH GETTING INFORMATION THAT THEY WANT. BUT I HAVE NOT. HEARD THAT FROM EVERYONE. WE HAVE TEN CAMPUSES FIVE. A HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THREE LAPS I IT'S A BIG EXECUTION AND HALF YOU WANNA FIND. ISSUES THEY WILL BE THERE WE FIND THEM ALL THE TIME. I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PART. AT WHAT WAS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT OCCURRED IN THIS I THINK THAT THERE THERE THERE IS A CHILLING EFFECT WHEN YOU ASK THAT KIND OF A QUESTION. BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. IT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY KINDA REACTS TO IT THAT'S ONE. TO WE HAVE A BOARD THAT'S VERY MUCH ON. ON TOP OF THIS RIGHT NOW. WELL I CAN PAY MY OWN VIEW THOUGH ABOUT THIS AND AND I'LL BE CHAIR FOR ANOTHER CUP YOU KNOW THE YEAR AND A HALF. I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN GOVERNMENT. UP HA IT'S JUST WHO I AM I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN OVERSIGHT. AYE HONOR WHAT YOU ALL DO I I I I COULD NOT DO THAT. BUT I DO WHAT I DO. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A KIND OF PARTNERSHIP THAT EXISTED. I'LL QUITE AWHILE AGO. I THINK THE PARTNERSHIP NOT TO THE EXTENT IT'S FRAYED. MORE RADICALLY RECENTLY BY PEOPLE'S VIEWS. BEGAN FRAYING SOMETIME AGO WOULD AND FROM MULTIPLE CAUSES NOW I'M NOT I THINK. WHETHER THAT IS. BUT THE THE RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND EIGHT. AND THE FOLLOW ON AND AND THEN THE FINGER POINTING ABOUT TUITION. THAT WAS I THINK THOUGHT OF BY THOSE PEOPLE LEGISLATURE THAT TIME HAS. GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THEN IT SORT OF BECAME MY GOD THERE'S GAMBLING IN CASA BLANCA THERE'S TUITION. WHAT A SURPRISE? SO I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A NEED FOR TRUST AND AND PARTNERSHIP ON ALL SIDES. I THINK THE BIGGEST BURDENS ON US. GIVEN WHAT'S OCCURRED AND ON THE UNIVERSITY. WAS BUT A A CLEAR DIRECTION HAS GONE OUT TO THE CHANCELLOR'S AND THAT THE PRESIDENT FIRST OF ALL. THE BOARD THE CHANCELLOR'S. THAT WE NEED TO BE. MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE AND MUCH MORE QUICKLY MUCH MORE QUICKLY. I RESPONSIVE AND ACCURATE IN OUR RESPONSES SO. I THINK THAT WILL TAKE PLACE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT SO MANY RULES YOU CAN PUT IN FOR THAT YOU DEVELOP A CULTURE FOR THAT. AND AND I THINK THAT CULTURE HAS BEEN THERE I THINK IT'S THEIR LARGELY. WHEN WE HEARD FROM THE HERE ON PEOPLE THE OTHER DAY ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE PICKING UP FROM. CAMPUSES AS TO HOW THEY REACTED TO THE SYSTEM OFFICE. NO WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THAT WAS THERE WAS NO GENERAL COMPLAINT BUT THERE WAS ANECDOTAL COMPLAIN IF THEY CALL JOHN SMITH. HE WASN'T VERY RESPONSIVE BY BETTY JONES WAS. SO I WAS MUCH MORE PERSONAL WE NEED TO PUSH THAT RIGHT THROUGH THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION CULTURALLY. ANA AND I KNOW FOR ME AND FOR THE BOARD WE'RE COMMITTED. TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND JUST AND JUST TO CLARIFY. HOME WHAT WHEN I WAS A DISCUSSING THROUGHOUT. THE CHALLENGES GETTING AIRPORT INFORMATION IS IS REALLY. ON MY EXPERIENCE AS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN EDUCATION WHICH IS WHERE. THE TIAS ASSEMBLY ARM FIGURES OUT HOW MUCH TO APPROPRIATE TO THE UNIVERSITY I THINK. WHEN IT WAS OR WASN'T AN INDIVIDUAL ON MEMBER REQUESTED WAS JUST THE ACTUAL ABILITY OF THEM HOW THE BODY TO GET FACTS OF THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATIONS IS WHICH IS FRANKLY OUR JOB. SO I THOUGHT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS I THINK IT IS YOU'RE EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. I AS I SAID DO YOU NUMBER NUMEROUS TIMES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THE REACHING THE BOARD OF REGENTS REALLY. PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OVERSIGHT OVER THE UNIVERSITY TO REALLY BE PROBABLE THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY THAT THE. THAT THE STATE REALLY INTENDED WHEN IT WAS FORMED AND I HOPE THAT THE CAN. I CONTINUE TO. SEE THAT HAPPEN A I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BY CARRYING OUT CHáVEZ ON HOMES. COMMITMENT TO LOOK INTO THE ISSUE THAT WASN'T ABLE TO BE LOOKED INTO BECAUSE OF THE INTERFERENCE AND THAT'S. I IN THE CULMINATION OF THE OF THE SHOW BUT REPORT I'M. GOING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM DUBLIN DISARMING COMMENTS IN THE BUT ALSO MY COMMENTS HOW HOW CAN WE. BE ASSURED THAT THE REPORT WILL BE AN ACCURATE REPORT THAT IT WON'T. ON. SOMEHOW PIECE SOME SORT OF SUGAR COATED DUH VERSION OR SOME SORT OF FOUND. HER FIRST THAT REALLY DOESN'T TAKE A VERY FRANK VIEW OF THIS DUPLICATION ISSUE TO THE VERY ISSUE THE HONOR WASN'T AYE PETARD BECAUSE LOOK AT. I I THINK YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT WHEN YOU GET THE REPORT. THE I THINK PART OF THE CREDIBILITY COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THE PERSONS WE HAVE TO DO IT. ARE THE IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATE PAST. HEADS OF. ESSAY DOT AND THE DEPUTY. STATE AUDITOR. SO WE'VE PICKED PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF CREDIBILITY WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES. OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL HELP. FOR SOME PEOPLE MAYBE IT WILL NEVER. BE ENOUGH BUT I'M I'M HOPEFUL THAT. THAT THAT WILL PROVIDE CREDIBILITY I THINK IT'LL HOUSE SO HAVE TO BE SEEN IN CONTEXT WITH THE. SURE ON REPORT AND WHAT THEY COME UP WITH HOW DOES THAT CROSS AND HOW WE FEEL GOT WISE. AND THEN I IN TALKING WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S. UNITED'S TO YOUR BUDGET POINT I GET THAT FOR YOU I TOOK ME A FOR EVER KNIFE IN THE STATE TIED TO IT. TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE BUDGET. HA I HOPE THAT BY. MAY. AND AND THEREAFTER WILL BE ABLE TO PUT THE BUDGET IN A FORM THAT'S MUCH MORE CONSISTENT WITH HOW YOU USUALLY LOOK AT BUDGETS. THESE BUDGETS CROSS INTO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM RELATES TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS. THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE GETS MONEY THAT DOESN'T END UP IN HER OFFICE IT JUST GETS PASSED THROUGH. LOT TO ANOTHER AND BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. SO WHO WERE IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING THAT IN ORDER HOW WE'VE GOTTEN GOOD ADVICE ON HOW TO DO THAT FROM THE AUDITOR. AND FROM THE FORMER A STATE AUDITOR AND. APPRECIATE THAT I'VE I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL GET CLOSER TO WHAT YOU WANT. THANK YOU. THERE'S SO QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU AND MISTER KEY FOR OR BOARD PRESIDENT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO AGAIN SOME OF THE THE. LAST SPRING WHERE THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS NOT DISCLOSED. AND THE SURPRISE UP WAS AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH AGAIN HOW. IT BE ALLOCATING. BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT YOU IN THE REGENTS. HAVE THE CLOSED SESSION AND THAT YOU FELT THAT IT WOULD UNANIMOUS WAS THERE A VOTE TAKEN IN CLOSED SESSION ABOUT ON THE THE FUTURE LEADERSHIP. THERE WAS NO FORMAL VOTE TAKEN. THERE WAS SAKE THERE WAS AND CLEAR CONSENSUS THERE WAS NO OBJECTION. I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE THAT WAS A VERY VERY LONG TIME. AND. A FIVE HOURS OR WHATEVER THE TIME WAS IT WAS A LONG TIME AND I WAS. CHAIRING THE MEETING. A LOT OF IT WAS TAKEN UP BY THE QUESTION AND ANSWER AND ANSWERS TO OTHER HOUSTON HANNIGAN MORENO FOLKS. THE POT TO THE GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT. AND THEN A DISCUSSION REALLY ABOUT WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE ACTION WE TAKE FOLLOWING THAT. SO. THAT WAS WHERE THE TIME WAS SPENT. ON WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. UP BECAUSE ONE OF THE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE AUDIT ON. WAS THAT THERE HAD BEEN DO. AT LEAST SOME DUPLICATION AS FAR AS POSITIONS AND AND AS THAT HAS BEEN LOOKED INTO THERE HAS BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT IF THAT DUPLICATION WAS NOT HAPPENING THERE COULD BE COST SAVINGS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. AND ALSO SOME OF THE INCREASES IN ADMINISTRATION SO KNOWING ABOUT YOUR CALENDAR FOR NOW THAT THERE WERE THERE WAS A MEETING SCHEDULED LAST WEEK FOR A TUITION INCREASE. UP SOME OF THE COST SAVINGS THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR SOME OF THE DIG DUPLICATION IS UP THE BATTLE OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU CAN SAVE. BY NOT HAVING A DUPLICATION AND POSITIONS. AND AS WAS NOTED TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE MS BAKER THAT. SHE HEARS FROM HER CONSTITUENTS I HEAR FROM STUDENTS ALL THE TIME ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY OF COLLEGE ABOUT ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO. AYE NOT ONLY US. GET INTO A YOU SEE BUT CAN THEY AFFORD TO GO AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT TUITION INCREASES AND I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OFF TRACK HERE. THAT'S IT'S REAL IT'S REAL TO US STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT. THAT YOU DIDN'T MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. THAT THE THE PRESIDENT WOULD NEED TO APOLOGIZE. THAT YOU HAD. A LETTER THAT YOU WERE WRITING I'M STILL STRUGGLING WITH IS THAT FAR ENOUGH I HAVE BEEN ONE OF TO A ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO ASK FOR THE PRESIDENT'S RESIGNATION. I KNOW THAT'S. SOUNDS UP PRETTY HARSH BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT THE CHIEF OF STAFF THE DEPUTY. CHIEF THAT THEY HAVE LEFT THE MANSION TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE LAUGHED I MEAN TYPICALLY IN ORGANIZATIONS IT RISES TO THE TOP AND ALTHOUGH. A SO I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE AS MISS BAKER WHAT IS ENOUGH AS FAR AS. THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE YOU DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE BECAUSE I CERTAINLY HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN I HAVE COFFEES IN MY DISTRICT ALL THE TIME I'M IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND WE GET ASKED UP HOW ARE USING OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS YOU KNOW WHY IS THIS GOING ON AND. SO I'M GONNA GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT I DON'T THINK WE'VE GONE FAR ENOUGH IN TO BUILD PUBLIC TRUST COMES WITH ACTION. POLLINIA. RESPOND TO OF A FEW THINGS YOU SAID ON THEIR. WITH RESPECT TO THE HUNTERDON ROUGHLY HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ROUGHLY WAS WHAT THE AUDITOR ORDER I THINK WHEN YOU BROKE THAT DOWN. IT. IT IT BECAME A DIFFERENT STORY THAN THE HEADLINE THAT WAS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS NOT THAT IT WAS MISS SPENT. ARE WASTED OR ANY FOUND ANYBODY FOUND ANY SAVINGS AND THAT. WHAT WAS FOUND WAS A AND I THINK? PARTLY OUR AIR AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT'S AREA. THAT DOES IN FACT THAT THE AUDITOR DIDN'T CRITICIZE ANY OTHER PROGRAMS AND NOBODY DEBATED THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAMS. AND WE KNEW THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE THERE WHAT WE HADN'T DONE AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD DONE. WAS BUDGET THOSE PROGRAMS OUT PROPERLY AND BUDGET TO ACTUAL. SO WHAT WAS DESCRIBED BY THE AUDITOR. AS OF BEING HIDDEN TO VIEW. BECAUSE NOT HAVING BEEN BUDGETED AND THEN ACCOUNTED FOR PROPERLY. I THINK WAS CORRECT. TO THE EXTENT THEY WERE HIDDEN AND THEN PLAYED BY NEWSPAPERS AS A SLUSH FUND WAS ENTIRELY INACCURATE AND UNFAIR. AND LEAD TO TO SERIOUS. MISCONCEPTIONS BY THE PUBLIC CERTAINLY. AND AND OTHERS. SO I. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE THOSE ARE ALL GOING TO BE BUDGETED IN ADVANCE. THE FUN THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR. FOR. SPECIAL INITIATIVES IS GOING TO BE VERY IS RELATIVELY SMALL. AHA AND APPROVALS WILL BE REQUIRED BY THE BOARD CHAIR AND SOMETIMES THE BOARD CHAIR OF THE FINANCE CHAIR. AND E. AND THE. CHAIR THE AUDIT COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE FOR CERTAIN KIND EXPENDITURES. SO I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATE THAT WHEN RAN AWAY WELL FROM US A PUBLICLY AND CREATED A FOR AN IMPRESSION WAS FAR DIFFERENT THAN I THINK THE REALITY. AND THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN OUR IN OUR BUDGETING. WITH RESPECT TO TUITION. THIS WILL ALWAYS BE A DIFFICULT ISSUE. I PROTESTED TUITION UP HERE. AGAINST YOUR PREDECESSORS. BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE AT A TIME WHEN I WAS PAYIG VIRTUALLY NOTHING COMPARATIVELY. BUT. WE AYE. AT AND THE OTHER FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR NOTE NO TUITION AS YOU KNOW. I UP TO HUNT AT ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE OUT YOU'RE GOING TO FAKE PAY FULL TUITION. TOO WE LIKE THIS PROCESS OF RAISING TUITION AYE WE DO NOT AND IT'S THE ONE WE GET THE MOST PRESSURE ON FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS INCLUDING YOU. BUT OUT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. BECAUSE OF OTHER PRESSURES ON THE BUDGET. THOSE PRESSURES HAVE PUT PRESSURES ON THE UNIVERSITY. AND IF YOU RAISE THE BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY BY FOUR PERCENT. WHICH IS NOT BEING PROPOSED AS YET. WHEN THE STATE ONLY PAYS FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COST OF THE CORE EDUCATION AYE COMES OUT TO ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. INCREASING THE STATE BUDGET. COMPARED OF TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT INCREASED INFLATION. NOW. WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. BUT GIVEN THE HISTORIC ONE THIRD CUTS IN THE BUDGET OVER SINCE TO THAT TOO NOW THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T EVERY YEAR KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. AND TRY TO TO HAVE MORE STUDENTS COMMITTED SYSTEM WHICH. WE'RE GETTING A GREAT DEMAND FROM STUDENTS WHO NOW QUALIFY FOR A THROUGH G. COURSES AND SO FORTH. WE'RE WE'RE KINDA RIDING THEIR THE WRONG MESSAGE FOR THE UNIVERSITY. OVER THE LONG TERM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND DIFFERENT DELIVERY METHODS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S CORRECT ON THAT. IN THE MEDIUM TERM WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE. FUNDING. THE STUDENTS WHO TODAY WANT TO GET IN ON A QUALIFY BUT THE COURSES THEY TAKE TO BE SOMEPLACE WITHIN. CSU ARE YOU SEE. SO. I WISH. IN A HOPEFULLY WE WE WE WE WE DEFERRED THAT DECISION AND I WAS A AT AT A REALLY OF. ON A SPLIT FEELING AMONG THE BOARD ABOUT IT. AND. WILL TAKE IT UP AGAIN IN MAY AND BY THAT TIME I'M SURE I'LL HEAR FROM. A NUMBER OF YOU A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE. ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO ABOUT THAT. MR MEDINA. S. FIRST. THANK YOU. MISTER KEY FOR. AND. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO RIVERSIDE AND MEETING WITH ME. I FOUND THAT VERY HELPFUL AND I WOULD SAY THAT IN MY FIVE YEARS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND SEVERAL THOSE YEARS AS CHAIR HYBRID OF EDUCATION. I HAVE NOT SEEN OF BEFORE. OF WHAT I'VE SEEN FROM YOU AND I THANK YOU AND GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND THAT IS. A A MUCH MORE ENGAGEMENT. WITH THE. WITH THE REGIONS OF WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND. AS TO TRUST. BUT I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND SOMETHING THAT WAS CALLED INTO DOUBT. OF WITH. DURING THE AUDIT BUT I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF ADDRESSING. AND AND I WOULD DARE SAY OR BE SO BOLD AS TO SAY THAT RELATIONSHIP IS TWO WAYS. AND. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR OF FORT RIGHTNESS BUT CHALLENGING US. THAT. A. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN'T DO. WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT. AND WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT THAT MORE. AS A LEGISLATIVE YEAR COMES AHEAD OF GOES FORWARD. BUT BUT IT IS A TWO WAY STREET. AND. BUT I SENATE COMMITTEES ALONG WITH OUR CHAIR AND AND SAW YOU SEE BEING A LITTLE OF IT NOT BEING ABLE TO BRING FIGURES TO US. NO WE'RE OR BRING FIGURES IN A USEFUL MATTER. TO US SO I SAT ON THOSE SUBJECTS. SUBCOMMITTEES. UP BUT I I KNOW THAT. IF ALL OF US HERE YOU KNOW OUR SINCERE IN WHAT WE SAY. THAT WE ARE ALL LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR STUDENTS. THAT WE WILL DO A BETTER JOB MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. Q. AND I'LL BE OUT AND RIVERSIDE NAY MARCH FIRST AND SECOND FOR ANOTHER CAMPUS WAS. BOB. THANK YOU WHISKEY RIVER BEING HERE I I JUST HAD A COMMENT I AND I. I WAS A LITTLE HESITANT TO BRING THIS UP BUT IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT STUCK WITH ME YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE CLOSE SESSION WHICH I BELIEVE TOOK PLACE AFTER OUR HEARING. WHERE WE HAD THE QUESTIONING OF OF? OF AMUSEMENT PALATABLE PRISON PONZANO. YOU REFERRED TO THAT IT AS A PERSONNEL MATTER WHEN MY OTHER COLLEAGUES INQUIRED ABOUT THAT AND ABOUT. THE YOU SAID THERE WERE NOT THERE WASN'T A VOTE. YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING ONE PERSONNEL MATTERS OF THIS. NATURE SERIOUSNESS AND CONCERNED STATEWIDE. OBVIOUSLY THAT LEGISLATURE'S VERY CONCERNED. MANY MEMBERS STICK STICKING AROUND OF FOR EVERY HEARING. ONE OF THINGS YOU SAID REALLY STRUCK ME AND I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT HAS ONE OF BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. AND THAT'S A FACT WHEN YOU WERE QUERIED ABOUT THE WEATHER OR NOT YOU WATCHED THE HEARING AND AND THE TESTIMONY OF A PRESENT OF ALL TIME NOW. YOU HAD JUST A LITTLE BIT. AND I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU ON THE SPOT I DON'T I DON'T REALLY EXPECT YOU TO FULLY. RECALL WHETHER YOU SEEN AT ALL OR PART OR WHAT PARTS YOU SEEN. BUT. I DO I THINK GIVEN THE THE SEVERITY OF THAT OF THE NAME OF AN AND THE NATURE OF. THIS INQUIRY AND THIS AUDIT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S INVOLVED AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS WE GET FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS REGULARLY ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S IT'S ONE OF IT UP SECOND ONLY TO THE GAS TAX BY THE WAY. OF THE HIGHEST RESPONSE RATE ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA RIGHT NOW HAS BEEN THIS ISSUE SO THAT JUST GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF OF THE SEVERITY. AND I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT IT WASN'T A MATTER OF. OF. POLICY IF YOU WELL OF THE REGENTS TO WATCH THAT HEARING. AND I KNOW THEY CAN BE BORING IS HACK I KNOW THEY CAN BE DRYING I KNOW THEY CAN BE CHALLENGING TO WATCH BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE. I I I'M VERY CONCERNED. SIR THAT. NOT ONLY DID YOU HATCH BUT YOU WEREN'TCONFIDENT THAT YOU THE REST OF THE REGENTS HAD SEEN THAT HIT THE HEARING IN BECAUSE THERE WERE FACTUAL ON MISTAKES. AND ERRORS A MADE IN IT MISSTATEMENTS MADE AND THAT HEARING AND. AND THEY'VE BEEN OUTLINED SOME OF THEM TODAY IN THEIR OUTLINED IN THE REPORT FROM A JUSTICE MARINO SO. I WOULD BE. I WOULD AYE I THINK WITH THAT I WOULD BE VERY. I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IF THE BOARD OF REGENTS WOULD GO BACK. AND REVISIT THAT THE ALL OF THE TESTIMONY THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE ASIDE FROM THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT. IS NOW DOWN TO THIRTY TWO OR WHATEVER IT IS TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE TRYING TO GET THE KIDS AND YOU SEE. IT'S A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT SO I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT APPRECIATE YOU KNOW HAVE TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT I'M YOU YOU'RE WELCOME WELL I'D LIKE TO I'D WANT TO. YEAH I'D LIKE TO. THE AYE HEADS BECAUSE I DID NOT WATCH ALL FOUR HOURS FOR. SOMETHING HOURS OF IT I TURNED IT OFF IT PARTS WHERE THE AUDITOR WAS SPEAKING BECAUSE I HAD SOMETHING ELSE THAT CAME UP. BUT I I THINK I SAW ALMOST ALL OF THE TESTIMONY OF MS LOZANO AND AND THE PRESIDENT. THE I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT. AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS LEARNED A LOT. SINCE THAT. HEARING AS WELL. MAMA AND ONE OF THINGS I'VE LEARNED ABOUT A LOT ABOUT WAS THE IMPACT OF THE CHIEF STAFF. MOM I THINK MOST OF THE REGION'S WATCH THAT HEARING. I CAN'T TELL YOU THE DIRECTION WAS MADE TO WATCH IT AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA. BUT THE REGION'S WERE KEENLY INTERESTED IN THAT HEARING. AFTER WHAT HAD. COME OUT. MOMMY SO I TAKE IT I TAKE YOUR ADVICE. TO TO HEART. AND. I'LL DO MY OWN LITTLE POLL TO FIND OUT AND TO THE EXTENT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN ABOUT ASKING THE WATCH IT. I'M SURE THEY'RE WATCHING OF THIS ONE AS WELL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MR KEY FOR HOW WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY DISTRICT INTO THE BEAUTIFUL CITY OF GARDENA. AND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST I WOULD LIKE TO. INVITE AND WELCOME. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT JANET NAPOLITANO WELCOME A PRESIDENT OF THE POTANO. FLOOR IS YOURS. WELL THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN MURATSUCHI AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM HERE TODAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. THAT I HOPE WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU AND TO RESPOND TO YOUR CONCERNS. AND WHILE WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DELVE INTO SOME DIFFICULT TOPICS I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOOK. POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP TOGETHER. DURING MY TIME AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY. OR FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR ACTIVE SUPPORT IN IMPROVING THE EXPERIENCE OF YOU SEE STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES. MANY OF YOU HERE TODAY ALONG WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ENABLED YOU SEE. TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT. UNDER TAKE NEW EFFORTS TO PROMOTE FACULTY DIVERSITY. INCREASED. AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACTIVITIES. AND INCREASED SUPPORT AND ACCESS FOR STUDENTS FROM ALL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS. YOU SEE NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT. AND I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY WITH YOU. I WANT TO START BY STATING VERY CLEARLY THAT I MADE A MISTAKE. AND I AM SORRY FOR. I ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE FACT FINDING REVIEW IN THE ACTIONS THE BOARD OF REGENTS HAVE TAKEN. TO ADMONISH ME FOR MY ROLE IN THIS. IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR ME TO APPROVE A PLAN. TO HAVE THE CAMPUSES SENSE SURVEY RESPONSESTO MY OFFICE. PRIOR TO THEIR SUBMISSION TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. MY INTENT AT THE TIME WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE RESPONSES TO THE SURVEY QUESTIONS. WERE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. THEY WERE FACTUALLY ACCURATE. THAT THEY REFLECTED THE CHANCELLOR'S VIEWS. BUT ITS CLEAR TO ME NOW THAT NO ONE AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN REVIEWING THE SURVEY RESPONSES. PROCESS THAT I APPROVED. HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON SOME CAMPUSES. THAT I SHOULD HAVE APPRECIATED AT THE TIME. I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I READ JUSTICE MORE RENTALS REPORT. WHAT SOME OF MY STAFF MEMBERS SAID TO THE CAMPUSES? BUT IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME. IT WAS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR ANYONE FROM MY OFFICE TO DISCOURAGE CAMPUSES FROM PROVIDING NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. I APOLOGIZE TO THE AUDITOR. TO YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO THE REGENTS. AND TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR THAT HAPPENING. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THIS TYPE OF THING DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BOTH MY FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. ARE NO LONGER WITH THE UNIVERSITY. AND CHOSE TO LEAVE PRIOR TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE MARIN A REPORT. MY NEW LEADERSHIP TEAM AND ALL OF THEIR REPORTS ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE HIGH STANDARDS WE MUST UPHOLD AS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. AND OF LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS TO NEVER REPEAT IT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I MYSELF HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. IT IS CLEAR THAT PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM DID NOT FEEL THEY WERE ABLE TO COME TO ME WITH THEIR CONCERNS. ABOUT HOW MY OFFICE WAS DEALING WITH THE SURVEYS. THAT IS MY FAULT AND MY RESPONSIBILITY. I WANT EVERYONE IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TO KNOW THAT MY OFFICE AND I VERY MUCH WANT TO HEAR YOUR CRITICISM AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE JOB WE ARE DOING. IF THAT MESSAGE WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE. I WANT YOU TO ASSURE YOU THAT IT IS CLEAR NOW. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND I AS PRESIDENT WANT TO HEAR WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT AND WHAT WE ARE DOING WRONG. OPEN DISCUSSION WILL ONLY HELP US DO A BETTER JOB OF SERVING THE CAMPUSES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WELCOME THAT DISCUSSION. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE TAKEN SOME SPECIFIC STEPS TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THE MISTAKES RELATED TO THE AUDIT DO NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. FOR THE PROMULGATION OF MARIN A REPORT. WE ADOPTED A NEW POLICY FOR HANDLING OUTSIDE AUDITS TO ENSURE THAT AUDITOR'S RECEIVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. AND IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES ITS INTEGRITY. UNDER THAT POLICY ALL UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES MUST FOLLOW THESE PROTOCOLS DURING THE STATE AUDIT. COOPERATE FULLY WITH ALL REQUEST FROM THE STATE AUDITOR INCLUDING INFORMATION REQUESTS AND MEETING REQUEST. PROVIDE TIMELY CANDID INCOMPLETE RESPONSES TO ENQUIRIES FROM THE STATE AUDITOR TO THE BEST OF THE EMPLOYEES KNOWLEDGE. PRIMARY CONTACT FOR ANY ENQUIRIES RELATING TO A STATE AUDIT DURING AUDIT FIELDWORK IS A MEMBER OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S TEAM. AND THE CAMPUS INTERNAL AUDIT DIRECTOR OR DESIGNATED EXTERNAL AUDIT AUDIT COORDINATOR. WILL SERVE AS THE INTERNAL POINT OF CONTACT FOR ENQUIRIES RELATING TO A STATE AUDIT AND CONSERVE TO FACILITATE COMMUNICATION WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AS NECESSARY. WE'VE ALSO HIRED ALEX BUSTAMANTE IS THE NEW SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT OFFICER. FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. MISTER BUSTAMANTE IS DEMONSTRATED INDEPENDENCE AND AN UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO HIS RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. AND MOST RECENTLY SERVED AS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. FURTHERMORE AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THE REGIONS HAVE ADOPTED A NEW POLICY THAT GIVES THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT OFFICER A DIRECT SOUL REPORTING LINE TO THE REGENTS. ON ANY MATTERS RELATED TO AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. A POLICY CLARIFIES AND STRENGTHENS ALEX'S ROLL AND REINFORCES HIS INDEPENDENT REPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO THE BOARD. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT IN MATTERS CONCERNING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. CHIEF COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT OFFICER NOT ONLY HAS THE ABILITY. BUT THE DUTY TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS AND REPORTS A MEETS REGULARLY WITH THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD. AND THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT. THE POLICY ALSO EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS. INTERFERENCE WAS STATE AUDITOR AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE'VE INSTITUTED SOME CHANGES THAT I BELIEVE FOSTER A MORE OPEN AND INCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU CO P. AND THE CAMPUSES. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE RECONSTITUTED THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. COMPRISED OF LEADERS FROM EACH CAMPUS MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AND LEADERS FROM MY OFFICE TO ADVISE THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IN DECISION MAKING THAT ENSURES THAT ARE BUDGET PRIORITIES ARE ALIGNED WITH CAMPUS PRIORITIES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT I PERSONALLY MEETING MORE REGULARLY ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS. WITH INDIVIDUAL UC CAMPUS CHANCELLORS WITH YOU CO P. LEADERS AND WITH REGENTS. SO BEFORE I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M EXTREMELY PROUD TO LEAD THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I APOLOGIZE AGAIN FOR MY ACTIONS AND THOSE OF MY OFFICE. THAT HAVE DISTRACTED FROM THE MISSION OF THIS WONDERFUL INSTITUTION. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH YOU. TO ENSURE THAT YOU SEE IT REMAINS A GREAT PUBLIC INSTITUTION AND MAINTAINS ITS HONORED POSITION AMONG UNIVERSITIES WORLDWIDE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS BAKER. I THINK YOU AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR APOLOGY. AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY. SOME FACTUAL QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE WE'VE BROUGHT UP BEFORE. AND. AND I I JUST WANT TO. VISIT WITH YOU DIRECTLY BOTTOM ONE IS. DID IT AT WHAT POINT IF ANY DID YOU LEARN THAT THE AUDITOR AND MARK THE SURVEYS ARE INTENDED FOR THE SURVEYS NOT TO BE SHARED WITH THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT. THAT YOUR TEAM EVER MADE AWARE TO YOU THAT THEY WERE STAMPED DO NOT SHARE OUTSIDE OF THE CAMPUS. I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT AT THE TIME OKAY. AND DO YOU REMEMBER ROUGHLY WHEN YOU WERE MADE AWARE CERTAIN WAS THAT WHEN THE AUDIT REPORT CAME OUT OR. AT WHAT POINT YOU LEARNED THAT THEY WERE THAT THEY HAD BEEN MARK THAT WHEN THE AUDITOR INTENDED THAT WERE SERVICE TO BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE. I LEARNED THAT WHEN THE AUDIT REPORT CAME OUT. AND AND I I VERY MUCH TRIED TO BE SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING AFTER AUDITS FROM FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND MEDIA COVERAGE AND ANOTHER AUDIT HAPPENING A TEAM FEELING LIKE THEY'RE BACK IS UP AGAINST THE WALL AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS THEIR BEST. FOOT FORWARD AND. SO I AM TRYING TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME. ALSO VERY CONCERNED. THAT. THE INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED WITH US WAS NOT IN CANDOR AND FORTHRIGHT. WENT FOR FOR EXAMPLE WENT WHEN YOU DID. DIRECT THE TEAM TO RECALL THE SERVICE AT THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF. MISTER MARINO'S REPORT WAS THAT YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE SURVEYS ARE GOING TO BE RECALLED Y. THINK THE REPORT IF I MIGHT SAY SO. AND I THINK WE MAY BE HAVING UP A MISCOMMUNICATION. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FIVE PROVED A PLAN. BY WHICH THE CAMPUSES WOULD SUBMIT THEIR SURVEYS. TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. BEFORE SUBMITTING THEM TO THE STATE AUDITOR. OTHER THAN. A DISCUSSION WITH THE CHANCELLOR AT SANTA CRUZ ON ONE INSTANCE. I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN SO CALLED RECALLING THE SURVEYS. OKAY. I AM NOT SURE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN APPROVING A PLAN THAT THE SURVEYS COME BACK TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. MAYBE MEAN YOU WEREN'T INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT. I'M NOT SURE. BUT THAT THE REPORT CONCLUDED. THAT YOU ARE AWARE. AND THE. EMAIL. FROM SANTA CRUZ INDICATES THAT CURRENT DISCUSSION WITH YOU THE SURVEYS WERE GOING TO BE COMING TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNEW THEY WERE COMING TO YOUR OFFICE AND THAT WAS WITH YOUR. NOW THE KNOWLEDGE BUT MY UNDERSTAND IS A DIRECTION. YES. I'VE PROVED IN IN THIS WAS A MISTAKE. I APPROVED A PLAN. BY WHICH. THE CAMPUSES WOULD SUBMIT THEIR SURVEYS TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PRIOR TO SUBMITTING THEM TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S. WHEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS. IN APPROVING THAT PLANNED WHAT DID YOU ANTICIPATE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE SURVEYS WHEN THEY CAME BACK TO THE OFFICE WHAT AFFECT WHAT ACTION DID YOU THINK WOULD BE TAKEN. THE REVIEW WAS INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ANSWERS WERE ACCURATE. WITHIN SCOPE. AND THAT THEY REFLECTED THE VIEWS OF THE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP. AND. YOU KNOW WE HAD HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF WITH. PREVIOUS AUDIT WHERE INACCURATE INFORMATION. ENDED UP HAVING A LONG TAIL AND GOT INTO THE FINAL AUDIT REPORT. WE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO CORRECT IT IN THE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE STATE AUDITOR. AND SO. THE FOCUS ON ACCURACY WAS WAS KEY. AND REALIZE THE SURVEYS HAD GONE TO THE CAMPUS AUDITOR'S. BUT. THE CAMPUS AUDITORS WERE NOT NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE IN THE BEST POSITION TO ANSWER THE SURVEYS. AND THERE WAS. I NOW KNOW A CONCLUSORY QUESTION AT THE END ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THAT THAT ALSO. VALIDATED THE NEED FOR THE CHANCELLOR HIM OR HERSELF. TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD REVIEWED THE ANSWERS SO. THAT WAS THE INTENT AS JUSTICE MORENO I THINK JUST DESCRIBED. IT WAS. WRONG BUT IT WAS BENIGN AT THE OUTSET. SO IF IF THE ENTITY AND SAID THE REASON WHY YOU WANTED TO DO WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACCURATE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S HAD. AT OP TO SEE THEM THERE WERE SOME ALL THAT THREE OR FOUR REASONS IT BEEN GIVEN FOR WHY. BUT LET'S SAY WHAT WHAT I'M HEARING AS WE THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA COME BACK IF THEY WEREN'T ACCURATE. THEN WE WERE GOING WE'D BE IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT I HEAR WHEN I HEAR IT WE WE WANTED THEM TO COME HERE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACCURATE AND DID THESE THINGS. AND STATE YOU'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED SOMEHOW IN THE RESPONSES OF THOSE SURVEYS. WHEN THEY CAME BACK IT WASN'T JUST THAT. WE'RE GONNA SPRING INTO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. UNDERSTANDING HOW A DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF AND CHIEF OF STAFF IN THE PRESIDENT. DIDN'T HAVE AN INDICATION THAT THIS THEY WERE GONNA BE INVOLVED IN THE SERVICE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I. DELEGATED THE WORK OF THE SURVEYS. TO MY STAFF. ONCE IT WAS DECIDED THAT. WE WERE GOING TO. RECEIVE THE SURVEYS. BACK AND CHECK THEM FOR ACCURACY SCOPE CHANCELLOR INVOLVEMENT. YOU KNOW I MOVED ON TO OTHER THINGS. AND. YOU NO PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE PAID GREATER ATTENTION. BECAUSE I NOW KNOW HAVING READ THE MORENO REPORT. THAT UP WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SURVEYS WENT FAR BEYOND THAT INITIAL INTO. I APPRECIATE THAT I I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT A LESSON LEARNED IN ANY ONE OF US COULD TAKE THIS LESSON IS IF YOU'RE ASKING FOR SOMETHING COME BACK TO YOUR OFFICE TO MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE. YOU'RE OPENING THE DOOR FOR THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT'S GOING TO BE CHANGED BY OUR OFFICE. AND WHETHER IT'S FUTURE AUDITS THAT HAPPENED OR FUTURE INFORMATION. THAT IS A. A STRAIGHT FORWARD. LASSEN ALSO IN HERE JUST TO SPELL IT OUT REALLY CLEARLY. AND. I AM FINALLY AFTER THESE. SURVEYS WERE THE DIRECTIVE WAS GIVEN TO RETURN THE SURVEYS TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DID YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF TO ASK. HEY HOW IS THAT GOING WHAT'S WHAT'S OUR BABY GIVING THEM TO YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM OR DID YOU NOT HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR STAFF AT ALL. AFTER THAT. MEANING THE DEPUTY YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF. THE ONLY. INTERACTION I HAD WITH THE SURVEYS AFTER THAT POINT WAS. WHEN. I BELIEVE IT WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF SAID. COULD COULD I CALL THE CHANCELLOR AT SANTA CRUZ BECAUSE. SOMEHOW HE HAD LEARNED. THAT. THEIR SURVEY HAD GONE AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT THE CHANCELLOR'S REVIEW. AND AYE CALLED CHANCELLOR BLUMENTHAL AND. OUR RECOLLECTIONS OF THAT PHONE CALL DIFFER. I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY BUSINESSLIKE CALL. YOU KNOW. CHANCELLOR DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO. REVIEW THAT. AUDIT RESPONSE TO THIS SURVEY AND. HE SAID NO HE WAS UNAWARE THAT IT HAD GONE AND THEN WE TALK FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ABOUT. WHAT HE COULD DO ABOUT THAT AND? EITHER HERE I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF A ONE OUT YOU JUST ASK TO WITHDRAW IT SO YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF MY INTERACTION. WELL THANK YOU. I SAID MENTIONED I HOPE THERE WILL BE A TURNING OF THE PAGE IT YOU SEE. AND I I KNOW THAT THE STUDENTS NEED IT. FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA NEEDED WE WE WANT TO BE AND SHOULD BE SUPPORTED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I WILL CONTINUE TO BE. AND WHAT WE CAN FIND WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR APOLOGY. I AM I DO BELIEVE THAT. THERE ARE NO OTHER INSTITUTIONS WHERE FOLKS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND NOT HAD MUCH MORE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU'VE HAD. EXPERIENCE HERE. YEAH I THANK YOU FOR COMING AND TESTIFYING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS SHOW US AROUND. I THINK YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT THANK YOU OFFER. FOR YOUR STATE ANY APOLOGY. ON I I LIKE TO. TO. TALK A LITTLE ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES A COUPLE DAYS AGO. AND THAT TALKED ABOUT THIS UPCOMING HEARING. AND IT HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF THE PARTICULAR. THINGS COMING OUT OF THE AUDIT WHICH IS THIS YEAR ON REVIEW AND AN EFFECT ON ME. ME WANT TO HEAR SOME COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT KEY FOR WHO'S HERE. STILL. OUR ABOUT THE REACTION I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LA TIMES REPORTS. WAS CONCERNED FROM A LOT OF FOLKS THAT BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE CRITICISM IT'S HAPPENING AS A RESULT. OF THIS INCIDENT THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. THAT THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT MAY BE CONSIDERING. A SERIES OF CHANGES THAT MADE ME A BIG MAY BE DISRUPTIVE UNNECESSARY AS THE AS THE LA TIMES REPORTS. AND. YOU KNOW. THAT THE TIMES REPORTED THAT THE MOB OUTSIDE REVIEW FOUND RELATIVELY LITTLE FAT. IN THE OFFICE OF HE PRESENCE OVERSIGHT OF THE MOST COMPLEX UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE NATION. NINE AND FOUND THAT THE UC OFFICE IS RELATIVELY LEAN AS IT LEADS THE NATION WITH WORLD CLASS SERVICES. MY CONCERN I SUPPOSE IS THAT IN THE WAKE OF ALL OF THE. FOCUS THAT'S BEEN ON. THESE. YOU KNOW THIS THIS RUN THIS IS CLEAR WRONGDOING THAT WAS DONE BY SOME FOLKS IN YOUR OFFICE. THAT YOU ARE FEELING PRESSURE TO MAKE A SERIES OF DRAMATIC CHANGES THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THEY MAY END UP ON. EFFECTIVELY RESULT AND JUST KIND OF REARRANGING DECK CHAIRS ON THE ON THE ON THE DECK. WHILE NOT NECESSARILY AND. SITTING ON A MONEY. I KNOW THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT UP IN AN OUTRIGHT ELIMINATION OF THE YOU SEE MEXICO INITIATIVE. ARE I KNOW THERE'S A PUSH TO TRY TO SPIN OUT A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS TO THE CAMPUS IS WHICH. DOESN'T LIMIT THE PROGRAM I DON'T I DON'T SEE HOW THAT SAVES MONEY NECESSARILY JUST MEANS AT THAT WORK IS HAPPENING ON CAMPUS AS OPPOSED TO CENTRALLY. I SUPPOSE THAT HAS SOME ADVANTAGES THOUGH THAT COURSE OF ITS AS IF IT'S A SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAM. MAY MAKE SENSE TO HAVE A RUN OUT OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT SO I SUPPOSE MY FEAR AND IN AS HE SAID ABUSE IN HERE WELL ANOTHER THING IT'S BEEN MENTIONED IS LIMITING POSTDOC FELLOWSHIPS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED WOMEN MINORITIES. AND THERE WAS ALSO IN THE REPORT SO I GET. THE FACT THAT AND. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE NOW ON YOU TO MAKE YOU KNOW TO SLASH. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE NOT BEING PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH. I IN RESPONSE TO ALL OF THIS LEGITIMATE CRITICISM. THAT EIGHT IN WAYS THAT WILL BE DAMAGING TO THE UNIVERSITY ON THE LONG TERM. AND I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND IF THE PRESIDENT HAS ANY. IF THE POOR CHAIR OF THE CHECK THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL SALINAS IN HEARING. SURE SIR SO. FIRST OF ALL THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN REVIEWED SOMETHING LIKE. TEN TIMES IN THE PAST ELEVEN YEARS. EVERYONE WANTS TO FIND THE HOLY GRAIL OF. WASTE FRAUD ABUSE WHAT WHATEVER. AND THE REPORT BY. A CONSULTANT WHO'S REVIEWED FIVE HUNDRED HIGHER EDUCATION. SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CONCLUDES. WELL ACTUALLY. FAIRLY LEAN IN OUR IN OUR OPERATION GIVEN THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. NONE THE LESS WE NEED TO CONSISTENTLY. BE THINKING ABOUT. WELL HOW ARE WE. ORGANIZED TO PROVIDE THE BEST VALUE TO THE SYSTEM. ARE THERE THINGS THAT ARE LOCATED IN OAKLAND. THAT. COULD BE RUN BY A CAMPUS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SYSTEM. YOU SEE PRESS. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE. UP ARE THERE. PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY. MATURE THAT THEY CAN BE ALMOST STANDALONE UNITS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY SO THE TWO REFERENCED ARE. YOU SEE HEALTH. A AND AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. DOESOUR. SOME OF THOSE ARE. RELATIVELY DISCREET DECISIONS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT. SOME OF THEM ARE. FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE GUIDED BY OUR BEST ANALYSIS AS TO. WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA? REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICAL PRESSURES OF THE DAY. AND THAT IS OUR INTENT IN RECEIVING THE HURON REPORT WE'RE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING. CONSULTATIONS ABOUT IT. THESE ARE NOT DECISIONS TO BE TAKEN QUICKLY OR LIGHTLY. AND THEY'RE ALL GUIDED BY. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE IDEAL SIZE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT AS IF THESE PROGRAMS GO AWAY. THAT THE QUESTION IS. OR THEY. BEST A MANAGED FROM. THE CENTRAL OFFICE OR. CAN THEY BE CALM BEST MANAGED BY THE CAMPUS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIS IS. RIGHT I MAY JUST. I I HOPE THAT THAT'S EXACTLY THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE BECAUSE. I'D JUST SEE I SEE IT ALL THIS MAELSTROM ALL THIS PRESSURE THAT YOU'RE FEELING I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY MAKING SOME ABRUPT DECISIONS THAT MAY END UP BEING. TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE SYSTEM AND I'LL I'LL JUST. YOU KNOW SITE THIS. QUOTE IN THE PAPER FROM THE CHAIRMAN THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE YOU. WERE CLOSE TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE WHEN I WAS ON THE REGION'S AND AND HAVE MEMBERS MY FAMILY OR PROFESSORS I KNOW THAT'S NOT A LOT OF LOVE LOST AMONGST THE FACULTY FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. WITHIN THE FIRST CALIFORNIA AND YET. ARE NONE THE YOU KNOW BUT I I THINK THAT THE CHAIR MAKES A VERY GOOD POINT MR Y.. WHEN HE SAYS ANY CHANGES TO BE MADE MUST BE DONE SO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE COMMON GOOD NOT FOR ANY THOUGHT OF EMPTY POLITICAL APPEASEMENT. AND DOWN. YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS APPEAR WHO JUST WANT TO TAKE RAZAK REVENGE. ON THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. ARE BECAUSE IT'S POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT BUT TOWN. I REALLY HOPE THAT. THAT THE. YOU DON'T. THAT MAKE DECISIONS THAT WILL BE YEAH DAMAGING IN THE LONG TERM OF THE INSTITUTION. ARE BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL HEAT OF THE MOMENT. I'M WITH YOU. YOU SEE. HAS A. ALMOST MONTHLY. A ROUND TABLE WITH LEGISLATORS. OTHER WE WE. DID YOU SEE CONVENES A ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO HAVE THE UC CAMPUS AND THERE DISTRICT. I THINK IT'S EITHER MONTHLY BI MONTHLY THINK IT'S BIMONTHLY AT ITS VALUE. VERY VALUABLE I THINK TO TO ME AND OTHER LEGISLATORS WHO PARTICIPATE. AND I KNOW THAT MANY TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE EVEN SOME WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE UC CAMPUS. ON THEIR. IN THEIR DISTRICT. A WE'VE HEARD FROM. THE CHAIR KEY FOR THAT. THERE THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE VISITS. IN OUR DISTRICTS WITH US WITH US AS LEGISLATORS. SO I I SEE A LOT OF A. A. YOU KNOW INITIATIVE BY UC. TO TO IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU SEE. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND LEGISLATORS. BESIDES THOSE TWO THAT I MENTIONED WHAT ELSE. MIGHT YOU HAVE IN MIND TO IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND YOU SEE IN GENERAL. WHAT BY I THINK THE MORE THAT? WE CAN ENGAGE IN PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT ONE ON ONE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. SOCIAL EVENTS. NEXT WEEK. THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND YOU ARE CO SPONSORING. AN EVENT WITH. OUR CAMPUS CHANCELLORS WHO WILL ALL BE MEETING IN SACRAMENTO. WE THINK OF IT ALMOST AS A SPEED DATING WITH CHANCELLOR'S. WHERE? MEMBERS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN COME AND TALK WITH CHANCELLORS AND I WOULD HOPE. THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS REVOLVE AROUND THE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY. THIS THIS UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN RUN ON A TIGHT STRING. FOR ON A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT'S WHY THERE'S SUCH PRESSURE ON TUITION. AND YES WE CAN CONTINUALLY LOOK FOR WAYS TO CUT COSTS. BUT IN THE AND TO RUN A WORLD CLASS INSTITUTION LIKE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PAY FACULTY SUPPORT GRADUATE STUDENTS. DO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ON YOUR FACILITIES. A THOSE NEEDS DON'T GO AWAY AND AND AND THAT I HOPE IS SOMETHING THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S CAN PUT INTO TANGIBLE FORM BEYOND NUMBERS ON A PIECE OF PAPER. OFFER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. CHARLIE. A PRESIDENT ALTERNATE LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT A STATEMENT HERE ON PAGE TWO OF THE APPENDIX THAT YOU MAKE. YOU QUOTED AS SAYING YOU'D LIKE TO THINK THAT AN AUDITOR COMES IN. AYE WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO FIND. ALL CONFESSED THAT ON THIS ONE I DIDN'T HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE. FROM THE OUTSET WE NEED THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT AUDIT. I WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR YOUR LACK OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD COME IN WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS. WELL WE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE AUDITOR. AND. WE NEW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT THAT SHE HAD BUDGETED THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND HOURS. AND WE KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE THAT THAT MEANS THREE TIMES THAT IN TERMS OF THE. TIME IT WILL TAKE FOR US TO RESPOND TO THE THE AUDIT REQUESTS. WE NEWS THAT. THE. I IT WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE. TREME MEETING OF OF THE. AUDIT TEAM TO THE UNIVERSITY WAS. EXTRAORDINARILY TOUGH FAR RANGING. AND. THAT. THAT THEY WERE GOING TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING. NOW LOOK LOOKING AT EVERYTHING IS IS PERFECTLY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF OF AN AUDITOR WE KNOW THAT. GETTING ACCURATE INFORMATION IS SOMETHING THAT. NEEDS TO HAPPEN DURING AN AUDIT WE KNOW THAT. BUT. AS THE AUDIT. WAS HAPPENING. IT WAS A CONCERN THAT. THIS. AUDIT TEAM WAS. ROAMING THE HALLS AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. NOT COORDINATING. MEETINGS OR APPOINTMENTS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WERE ALSO INVOLVED IN OTHER WORK FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UNIVERSITY SO. TRYING TO. DEAL WITH THE AUDITOR AND CONTINUE WITH A YEAR WHERE WE WERE HAVING A RECORD INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT WE HAD TO CHANCELLOR SEARCHES UNDERWAY. WE WERE UNDERGOING A MASSIVE REVISION OF OUR POLICIES ON. SEXUAL VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. THAT THAT WAS IT A CONCERN SO. YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT BLENDED TOGETHER. BUT YOU MENTION PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS I'VE WHAT WERE THOSE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT YOU THINK ARE BROUGHT. INTO THE AUDIT THE OUTSIDE. SO I THINK THERE. I WAS REFLECTING THE COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT. AUDITORS ARE THERE TO FIND STUFF. AND. GIVEN THE TENOR WITH WHICH. OUR LAST AUDIT EXPERIENCE SAID AND DID. ON SATISFACTORILY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. WE WE WE DIDN'T SEE ANY CHANGE OR IMPROVEMENT IN THAT RELATIONSHIP PASSING WOULD YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS AND GIVE THEM THE RECEIVING END OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT FOR HOW FUTURE AUDITS UP FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR AND MIGHT BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND BETTER SERVE THAT THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGISLATURE. WEALTH. I DON'T WANNA MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO. THE STATE AUDITOR. SHE HAS HER JOB WE HAVE OUR JOB SURE. AND. I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW SHE CAN DO HER JOB AND WE CAN DO OUR JOB. AND MOVE MOVE THE UNIVERSITY FOR. THANK YOU. ASSERTING. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR BEING HERE DAY I THINK. I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER TO BOTH ARMS THE. CHEROKEE FOR INJUSTICE MORENO. THE. THE CHAD THE HISTORIC CHALLENGING HERE WE'VE HAD CONVERSATION ABOUT ABOUT TRYING TO GET. INFORMATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY ON I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO I CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THAT AN OPPONENT. ON. MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE UP PROGRESS ON ENSURING THAT WE CONTINUE TO GET. FACTUAL INFORMATION YOU GET IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY WE WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE YOUR YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW WORK WITH US IN THAT MANNER. YEAH. YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT AND. YOU ALSO HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER SO IF THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT IS OCCURRING I HOPE YOU'LL LET ME KNOW AT NO ABSOLUTELY AND WE WE APPRECIATE THAT. COMMUNICATION I I'D I DO WANNA GO BACK TO HER HOME ME I ASKED JUSTICE MORENO SOME QUESTIONS AROUND. THAT. DID THE THREE. I DEALS THAT YOU OUTLINED IN TERMS OF THE PLAN. AND. THROUGH HIS REPORT HE HE WENT THROUGH AND JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE. AND THAT THAT NONE OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT ANY OF THE THREE STATED REASONS WAR. WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING? A. NO BELIEVE WEATHER IS ON. YOU KNOW YOUR ACTIONS ARE YOUR COUGAR DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF YOU CHIEF OF STAFF ACTIONS. HOME IN IN YOUR MIND WHAT WHY DO YOU THINK. YOU HAD THREE PARTICULAR. THINGS THAT WERE STATED. THE CAMPUS IS NEVER. ASK FOR HELP. NONE OF THE FEEDBACK WAS REGARDING ACCURACY. ON NONE OF THE FEEDBACK WAS REALLY REGARDING SCOPE. WHY DO YOU BELIEVE? THERE WERE SUCH A. SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE IN TERMS OF ACTION FROM WHAT AND WHAT THE PLAN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. YOU KNOW. THE. PLAN AS ADOPTED IN AND. WAS. INTENDED JUSTICE I'VE STATED WITH THE THREE PURPOSES. PERHAPS. MY CHIEF OF STAFF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF. THOUGHT THAT. IF THEY WERE DOING WHAT I WANTED THEM TO DO. ALTHOUGH I'D NOT. GIVEN THEM THAT DIRECTION. HAD I KNOWN WHAT THEY WERE DOING I WOULD HAVE INTERVENED AND STOPPED. AND I'VE TESTIFIED TO THAT PREVIOUSLY I DIDN'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES UNTIL I RECEIVE THEM AROUND A REPORT. BUT. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT. YOU KNOW IT HAPPENED ON MY WATCH. THAT WAS MY STAFF. I ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. AND I THINK I APPRECIATE THAT I I GUESS I WANT TO GO BACK TO CSUS WELL WHAT THAT. JUSTICE OUTLINED IN THE APPENDIX TERMS OF DIRECTION SO THERE WAS THIS. A NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH DINNER THERE WAS PRIOR I THINK PART OF VOTE FRAUD REGENTS MEETING GET TO CONVENE WITH CHESTER'S. WHERE? HOME CHANCES HEARD THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE THEY HEARD ABOUT YOU TALKING ABOUT THE SERVER AT THE HEART OF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. IT'S. POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT YOU HAD A CALL. WITH THE CHANCELLOR BLUMENTHAL ON TEN NOVEMBER SECOND TWENTY SECOND LATER ON AFTER SURVEYS WERE BEING TURNED IN. ARM. YOU YOUR ACTIONS. HOME. EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE INSTRUCTION WITH YOUR STAFF SEEM TO OF LONGING. IN THE SAME DIRECTION. AS YOUR STAFF. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS I AND THAT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS JUST BASED ON THE APPENDICES MAYBE IT'S NOT A. A COMPLETELY ACTOR CAN YOU CAN YOU SEE WHY THAT IS IF IF YOU GIVE THIS PLANNED. THIS THIS PLAN ON AND THE EXECUTION WENT INTO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. YET THE THREE OF YOU ALL SEEM TO GO IN THE SAME. DIRECTION. WELL. FIRST. YOU KNOW RECOLLECTIONS OF WHAT. HAPPENED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S DINNER DIFFER. ONE CHANCELLOR. SAID. THAT I REFERENCE CONTROLLING. THE SURVEY. THE OTHER CHANCELLORS WERE AT THE DINNER THEY WERE PROBABLY ASKED THE SAME QUESTION BY HOUSTON HAD AGAIN AND. NONE OF THEM SAID THAT AND I DON'T RECALL SAYING. SO. YOU'VE GOT A DIFFERENCE IN RECOLLECTION. OBVIOUSLY. THE THE. ON IT. CAME UP IT WAS A BIG DEAL IT WAS A BIG SURVEY IT WAS A BIG AUDIT. SO. YES IT WAS A TOPIC OF. CONVERSATION WHAT I REGRET. IS. THAT. NONE OF THAT THE. CHANCELLOR'S RAISED WITH ME DIRECTLY. THE CONCERNED WITH HAVING OP IN THE MIDDLE OF. THE SURVEY. AND. NOW. YOU KNOW. WHY THAT IS IS A CULTURE QUESTION? AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO CORRECT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE OF SPOKEN ABOUT DIRECTLY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S. AND. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE THAT EASY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP AND I AND I FRANKLY THOUGHT DID. BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY ACTIVE MEETINGS OF MONTHLY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S AND THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF OPINIONS THAT THEY SHARE WITH ME. NO ONE RAISED THEIR HAND AT AT AT THAT TIME. AND. AGAIN I THINK I'VE. DESCRIBE THE PHONE CALL WITH. THE CHANCELLOR AT SANTA CRUZ AND. AND HE AND I HAVE SPOKEN SINCE THEN. AND. CLEARED WHATEVER AIR THERE WAS TO CLEAR. BUT. WE JUST HAVE VERY DIFFERENT RECOLLECTIONS OF THAT PHONE CALL. FAIR FAIR ENOUGH I THINK ALL GOING BACK TO THIS. WHEN I ALSO ASKED THE. CHAIRMAN THE JUSTICE WHAT'S AROUND THIS CONCERN AROUND THAT. THE CHILLING EFFECT ON WHETHER THE IT WHAT IT IS CHILLING EFFECT WAS JUST ONLY IN REGARDS TO THE AUDIT. OR WHETHER YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT I MIGHT HAVE LONG SOME LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES AND. STILL MAY BE. A IN EFFECT. SO. THE MUCH I UNDERSTAND YOU JUSTICE JUSTICE MORENO. TALKED ABOUT THE INTIMIDATION OF A CHILLING EFFECT BASED ON THE ALTERING OF THE SURVEY IS THE COLLECTION OF THE SURVEYS. AND THE CHILLING EFFECT WAS HOME IN ESSENCE THE. INABILITY FOR THE CAMPUSES TO REALLY SAY WHAT WAS. ON THERE MIGHT. I YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SAME THING REGARDING THIS DINNER HOW WHETHER OR NOT THE SURVEYS YOU KNOW IN WHAT FASHION SERVICE COME UP. IF TEN CHANCELLORS I TALKED TO THEM PERSONALLY FOR A NUMBER OF THEM JUST TO THINK THAT THEY'RE QUIET WOULD BE. A VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO IMAGINE AYE AYE A I FIND IT VERY BELIEVABLE THAT YOU HAVE VERY ANIMATED MEETINGS HAVING TALK TO MANY OF THEM I WOULD EXPECT THAT. ON THE FACT THAT YOU SAY THAT NONE OF THEM SAID ANYTHING. GIVE ME SOME CONCERN IN TERMS OF. ARE THEY. GOING TO GIVE YOU. THE FEEDBACK THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP YOU KNOW TO LEAVE. THE UNIVERSITY TO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. SO YES AND. I THINK THEY WILL I'M RELYING ON THEM TO. THEY GAVE ME SOME IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK TO THE HURON REPORT. ONE DAY. SAW IT. AND I HAVE INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM ON THAT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN THE IN THE PROCESS OF. RESPONDING TO SHOW OVER EVER SHANK. AND. YOU KNOW I NEED THE BAD INFORMATION AS WELL AS THE GOOD IF I'M TO EFFECTIVELY LEAD THIS ORGANIZATION. IT DOES NO ONE ANY GOOD TO PAINT A FALSE ROSY PICTURE. DOESN'T DO ME ANY GOOD DOESN'T DO YOU ANY GOOD SO. I'M. RELYING ON THE CHANCELLORS AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE WORKED OUR WAY THROUGH THIS GREAT THANK YOU MY MY LAST QUESTION JUST REGARDING THE SHOW PRINT REPORTERS. I WOULD JUST LIKE YOUR COMMITMENT THAT. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GONNA BE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM RESERVE ALTERING ALTERING THAT REPORT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THAT REPORT YOU CAN WE ASK QUESTIONS THAT. THAT'S. DATA I JUST WANNA BE ASSURED THAT THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE. A A REPEAT OF THIS HOME SANITIZING THE INFORMATION WHICH AS YOU HEARD DOCTOR WEBER STATE AN ACADEMIC SETTING IS JOE'S TOM. COMPLETELY. INEXCUSABLE YOU KNOW. I'M. HAVING. ANY REPEAT OF THIS WOULD BE CALM. INEXCUSABLE. THANK YOU. MR LIVING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU PRESIDENT PATAN ALSO THANK YOU MISTER KEY FOR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY EARLIER. AND FOR SEEN THROUGH THE SIDE THIS I'VE FACT FINDING. REVIEW. THE. I I THINK IT'S IT'S BEEN SAID THAT BUT THE BREAKDOWN IN TRUST IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO IT'S PRETTY SERIOUSLY AND. THAT. CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP THE FACT. NOW GOING BACK A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW WE'VE. CONDUCTED A GREAT NUMBER OF AUDITS MIND YOU SEE. AND SO. THE MEDIA AT THE BREAKDOWN IN TRUST I THINK PROBABLY GOES BOTH WAYS AND THAT. YOU SEE YOUR STAFF. CAN SEE AN AUDIT REQUEST AND AND WONDER. HOW THIS AUDIT GRENADE IS GOING TO BE LOBBED OVER AND AFFECT YOU IN THE INSTITUTION? WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AUDIT. AFTER IT WAS DIED THE THE ORIGINAL AUDIT. I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE OCALAN AT WHICH WHICH ONE WAS THAT BUT THE AUDIT THAT WAS ON YOU CO P.. THAT. THE FINDINGS ARE NOT FINDINGS THAT ALARMED ME. AS A LAWMAKER. I. FOUND THEM INSIGHTFUL INSTRUCTIVE THEY TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO BE BETTER BUDGET MEAN. BETTER BUDGETING PROCESSES. AT E. COMPARED A LITTLE BIT APPLES TO ORANGES WITH SOME OF THAT EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT PARA EDUCATION SEGMENT SO. IF YOU COULD PUT COME LOOK AT IT IN AND AND ANALYZED IT YOU WOULD SEE. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE. COMPARABLE UP POSITIONS ARE NOT. THAT WE CAN JUST TAKE THE INFORMATION AND SAY WELL THE CSU CFO IN THE U. CCF ARE EXACT SAME SPOT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME JOB. SO WHY WOULD THEY BE PAID THE SAME AMOUNT. SO AS AS LAWMAKERS. AND YOU KNOW IT'S OUR JOB TO LOOK AT THESE AUDITS AND THEN. ANALYZE IT FOR OURSELVES AND COME OUT WITH SOMETHING SO. AND SO I ALSO LOOK AT. SOME OF THE DISCRETIONARY PRIVATELY RAISED MONEY IN AND HOW THAT WAS SPENT AND THOUGHT WELL THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE. WHAT LAWMAKERS DO? WE PRIVATELY RAISE MONEY AND IF THERE'S A DINNER THAT'S PAID FOR BY THE PRIVATELY RAISE MONEY THAT'S NOT SUCH A BIG PROBLEM BUT. FOR YOU SEE PERHAPS THERE'S A BETTER BUDGETING SYSTEM ON THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT SO NONE OF THESE THINGS RAISE ALARM BELLS FOR ME AND. IT WAS THE HUMAN BEHAVIOR ELEMENT THAT JUST CAME IN AND OUR CURRENT TOUR THROUGH. THIS BUILDING AND THAT WERE STILL STRUGGLING WITH. AND I THINK. I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. BOTH YOU SEE. AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE TO BE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT IT AT THIS MOMENT. SO. MORE ENGAGEMENT BY YOU SEE IS PROBABLY GOOD DONE. BY. AGAIN A FACT FINDING REVIEW WAS A VERY POSITIVE THING. THAT WAS TAKEN ASIDE TAKING ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR OF COURSE THAT IS ALWAYS WELCOME. AND. AND I THINK FOR US. OUR CHARGES LAWMAKERS IS TO. REMAIN IN THAT OVERSIGHT ROLE BUT MAYBE WE CAN DO THIS IN A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER. THAT ALSO DOESN'T HIDE IT YOU KNOW IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT. SEIZE UPON FINDINGS WITHOUT OUR OWN ANALYSIS OF THOSE FINDINGS TO DETERMINE. WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD BE OUTRAGED OR THERE'S A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. TO BUILD TRUST IN WHAT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING INSTITUTION FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. THAT SHINES AS BRIGHTLY TODAY AS IT EVER DID AND BRIGHTER THAN ITS PEER INSTITUTIONS. THAT. WHAT WE DO WITH YOU SEE? YEAH I IT AND IN THE IMPACT OF THESE AUDITS IN THIS HUMAN BEHAVIOR ON YOU SEE IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT AND MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT. AND THAT WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT IT. THANK YOU. I AGREE WITH YOU. MISTER CHALMERS. THANK YOU ARE. LISTEN THIS WITH GREAT INTEREST AND OTHER ASKING WHY THEY WOULD BE HEAT. IN A AUDIT YOU KNOW HIS JOKE AROUND TWO GREATEST LIES ONE OF MS. I'M INSPECTING GENERAL I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. AND A LOT YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THE OTHER ONE IS THE BIGGEST LIE. THE. I WANT TO TAKE THE TIME BECAUSE I FOR LOT DISCUSSIONS APPEAR TO YOU WAY AND IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST. ECONOMIC DRIVERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY PROVIDE JOBS IN ACTIVITIES THAT DEFINE AN AREA IN THE PARTICULARS SAN DIEGO IT'S ALL IN THE. PHARMACEUTICALS AND IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. AND. I WOULD LIKE. TO GIVE DIRECTION TO. MR PALMISANO INTO THE REJECTS. THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FOCUS ON THAT. I LIKE YOU TO SPEND THE HOURS IN YOUR TIME. I'M SURE IN THE YOUNG PEOPLE. RB UNEDUCATED. AND BEING TRAINED FOR THE FUTURE. P. YOU ALIGN YOURSELF TO BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY IS CONTINUE TO GROW OUR ECONOMY. EN I WOULD HOPE THAT WE ARE NOT. CONTINUE TO BURN THESE HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF THOUSANDS OF HOURS. THAT WE HAVE TO IT AS LITTLE QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE SOMETHING GOING WRONG. BECAUSE I THINK. GOVERNMENT IS BEST WHEN WE HAVE CLEAR LINES OF RESPONSIBILITY HAS RESPONSIBILITY LEGISLATORS WE DO LAWS WE DO BUDGETS. HOW WE CAN YOU OVERSIGHT? BUT WE SHOULD NOT USE OUR INFLUENCE TO STOP INSTITUTIONS DEBT REALLY DRIVE THE ECONOMY IN THE STATE. AND SO. PRESIDENT PUB DOT I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN YOU. PLEASE GO FORTH INTO GREAT I WAS LOOKING HISTORICALLY HERE HOW LONG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN YOUR POSITION. I GUESS GO LIKE FIVE EIGHT YEARS NINE YEARS SO. YOUR YOUR FIFTH YEAR. HOPE YOU GET TO MAKE EIGHT OR NINE AND CONTINUE TO GO WHERE EVER LET ANYONE DO THIS. BUT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT WHATEVER AIR WHEN ON WAS CORRECTED. AND WE USED TO HAVE A A LINE THAT WE USED WHEN WE WOULD DO. INVESTIGATIONS IS. YOU CAN OF. FORGIVE AND THERE OF. WELL MISSION THAT'S WHAT I THINK THIS IS. WE DON'T FORGIVE ERRORS OF COMMISSION WHERE PEOPLE CLEARLY SO I'M GONNA DO A. B. C. DEED BARRETT SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS CASES TROUT ASK US ALL TO STAND BACK AND LOOK AT THAT. AND DON'T. TRY TO JUDGE A LARGE INSTITUTION HONOR SOMETIMES OWN LIMITED ABILITIES SO. THANK YOU FOR YOU DO ONE. I SEE YOU NEXT WEEK THANK YOU BY THE WAY I DON'T HAVE YOUR CELL NUMBER NO WHATEVER VISIT MY OFFICE. BUT THAT'S OKAY I UNDERSTAND I'M THE REPUBLIC IF WE DON'T GET THAT. MR ACOSTA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR. CLEANED ROOM LOOK AT THAT. POLITICAL FAST. THANK YOU. MR CULT TANA FOR BEING HERE. AND THANK YOU FOR. FRANKLY TAKING SOME RESPONSIBILITY AYE AYE TERRIBLE HATCHING IN YOU AS WELL AND I'M I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BUT. I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE I THINK IF WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE HEARING THAT WE HAD RIGHT SAT OVER THERE AND ASK YOU DIRECT QUESTIONS. STORIES CHANGE A LITTLE BIT. AND I'M GONNA GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO RESPOND A COUPLE THINGS BUT ONE OF THEM IS. ASK A DIRECT QUESTION AND DO YOU HAVE THE. TRUST IN YOUR CHANCELLOR'S. AND IN EACH CAMPUS THAT YOU ARE OVERSEE. I DO OKAY SO WHEN A SURVEY COMES TO A CAMPUS WHICH IS ITS OWN. THEIR YOU KNOW. SELF SUPPORTING ENTITY IN A SENSE AND IT RELIES ON THE U. OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT ADMINISTRATION ETCETERA I UNDERSTAND ARE THERE IN A CONNECTED. AND SAYS DO NOT. YOU DON'T SHARE THIS OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS. WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT? THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S WERE NOT CAPABLE WITHIN THEIR THEIR COLLECTIVE BODY OF THE CAMPUS AT THE UNIVERSITY AFTER ALL IT HAS. MATH AND SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE AND ECONOMICS DEPARTMENTS AND PHILOSOPHY AND ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT GO ON THERE. NOW YOU. AYE WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN. JUDICIAL PROCESSES IN AND EXPERTS WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY NEEDED THEN TO. SEND THEIR INFORMATION OFF TO TO. TO IT TO THEIR OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO BE REVIEWED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S DID THEIR JOB IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR CANCERS. IF BY THE VERY NATURE OF YOU REQUESTING THE INFORMATION THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S WERE CHARGED WITH. THAT YOU'RE. YOUR SECOND GUESSING THE CHANCELLOR'S ANOTHER WORDS. WAR IS THERE SOMETHING IN THAT THOSE SURVEYS THAT CONCERNED YOU BECAUSE YOU USE THIS THIS TERM. HERE THIS PHRASE HE SAID IT WAS A BIG DEAL AT BIG SURVEY A BIG AUDIT SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT KNOWS ON EVERYBODY'S RADAR. IF THAT WERE THE CASE. WHY THEN DID YOU NOT FOLLOW THE THE THE THAT? PRE SCRIBED AND PRE DESCRIBED ARE EFFORTS BY THE THE AUDITOR AND YOU'VE IT EVEN MINUTE WITH YOU GONE THROUGH LOTS AND LOTS ABOUT IT SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY'D ALL BE. YOU KNOW PERFORM AT THIS POINT FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT YOU DID KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT A LITTLE BIT. WHY DIDN'T YOUR YOU'D HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR CHANCELLOR'S THEN TO COMPLETE THE INFORMATION AND GET IT BACK TO THE AUDITOR WITHOUT THIS INTERFERENCE THAT NOW YOU'VE ADMITTED THAT YOU? FRANKLY I I HAVE DONE. WELL AS I RECALL. AT THE TIME. THERE WAS CONCERN EXPRESSED BY SOME OF THE CHANCELLOR'S. THAT. THERE. CAMPUS AUDITOR'S MAY RESPOND TO THE SURVEYS. WITHOUT TO THE CHANCELLOR. AND I BELIEVE THAT. THE APPENDIX TO THE MORETTO REPORT. INCLUDES A REFERENCE. TO THAT CONSUMER. AND. YOU KNOW. OUT OF THAT. CONCERT OUT OF. YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS ME NO PRACTICE OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH IS WEAK WE COORDINATE SURVEY RESPONSES TO THE CAMPUSES ALL THE TIME. AND IT'S NOT A REFLECTION OF A LACK OF TRUST IN THE CHANCELLOR IS JUST AS YOU MENTION THESE CAMPUSES ARE BIG PLACES AND SO. IT BECOMES KIND OF A BELT AND SUSPENDERS APPROACH. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY. GETS THE INFORMATION AND HAS HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT. SO. AND AND AGAIN. WE WOULD NOT DO IT THE SAME WAY AGAIN. AND HAVE. ADOPTED POLICIES ETCETERA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. BUT. I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE GENESIS. I I I'M STILL TROUBLED BY. THERE THE REQUIREMENT IF YOU WELL FOR IT TO COME UP IT TO MIKE MIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE BAY AREA'S. QUESTION EARLIER COMMENT EARLIER AS TO WHAT DID YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU GOT THEM BACK IN OTHER WORDS. THE CHANCELLOR'S DIDN'T TRUST THE AUDITOR'S TWENTY HEARING. TO NOT. COMPLETE PEACE WITHOUT THE CHANCELLOR'S IMPORT. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S THAT THEY'RE NOT. IN YOU KNOW INTEGRATED INTO THEIR INTO THEIR CAMPUSES. THAT SEEMS LIKE A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM THERE. TO WHERE THEY CAN'T TRUST THE AUDITOR'S TO WORK WITH THEM. AND THEN WHEN YOU FELT THAT WA THEIR YOUR OFFICE FELT IN SOME CASES THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU TO TAKE THAT AND THEN OVERSEE THE CHANCELLOR'S OR OVERSEEING THE AUDITOR'S. OUT WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN AT THAT POINT WHEN YOU GOT THEM AND IS MISSING INFORMATION WHO WAS GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO JUST SIMPLY SENATE BACK SAY YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE LINE FOURTEEN. I DON'T THINK WE GOT A CLEAR ANSWER FOR MIKE MY COLLEAGUE AND ASK YOU THAT QUESTION. WHAT WERE YOU PLANNING ON DOING? WHEN YOU DIRECTED THOSE TO COME BACK TO YOUR OFFICE THE WITH THEY WERE INCOMPLETE OR NEED TO BE CHANGED OF. TWO. OF WORK WITH OF THE CAMPUS. AND. WHERE? THERE WAS MISSING. INFORMATION. OR. INFORMATION THAT APPEARED INACCURATE. TO BE ABLE TO RAISE THAT WITH THE CAMPUS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAMPUS WAS. COMFORTABLE SAY YES THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO SAY. WHERE THIS WENT OFF THE RAILS WAS THAT? THE ACTIONS. FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WENT BEYOND THAT TO ACTUALLY. EDITING SOME OF THE RESPONSES AND A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH WITH THE CAN. IT WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL INTENT. BUT FORGIVE ME. MADAM PRESIDENT YOU'VE WORKED IN. PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS AND STATE GOVERNMENT AND. DO YOUR CURRENT POSITION ETCETERA. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT. YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE CHILLING EFFECT AS IT'S BEEN CALLED YOU KNOW CALLED HERE PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO. OF. EUROPE. YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR YOUR BOSS IS GOING TO REVIEW YOUR HOMEWORK. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR REPORT BEFORE YOU PRESENTED TO THE BOARD BUT IT'S ABOUT YOUR BOSS. I I MEAN. IS THAT WAS THAT JUST I'M SORRY THAT AT NO DISRESPECT MEANT WAS I DO I'M GONNA LOOK AT ALL YOUR STUFF BEFORE YOU SEND IT TO. MY BOSSES AND THE AUDITOR'S IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED HERE YOU KNOW. IT WAS A SERIOUS ERROR ON MY PART I JUST DIDN'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY. OUR CHANCELLORS ARE ALL STRONG INDEPENDENT PEOPLE AYE I DIDN'T SEE. THAT THERE WAS AN INHERENT CHILLING EFFECT THAT WOULD. BE IMPLICATED HERE. AND. YOU KNOW I NOW FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT HAVING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT INVOLVED IN THE MIDDLE OF A SURVEY ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. WAS OF FATALLY FLAWED THIS. YOU DIDN'T MAKE THAT IT WAS CHIU. AND I SAID THAT. I CERTAINLY DIDN'T INTEND IT TO BE CHILLING. ARE WELL THANK YOU UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M NOT CONVINCED. THAT THAT. FULL FAITH AND TRUST HAS BEEN RESTORED BY AND A SIMPLE APOLOGY. IN SOMETHING AGAIN. YOU KNOW SOMETHING SO SUCH A BIG DEAL A BIG SURVEY AND A BIG AUDIT. WHEN SO MANY THINGS WENT AWRY FROM SOMEONE WITH YOU YOU KNOW YOUR. AT YOUR PEDIGREE. FRANKLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER AND NOW IT'S LIKE WELL IT'S MY SUBORDINATES DID THIS AND IT THAT WE FOR THAT FAR TOO MANY TIMES. SO I'M AYE I APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE AND SIT HERE AND. ANSWER THE QUESTIONS I DO RESPECT YOU FOR THAT AND. FOR FREER ANSWERS IN YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT. MATTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR. YOU'RE VERY. DIRECTED KNOWLEDGE MEANT. OF FOR. YOUR ROLE AND NOW ALL OF THIS. I. WANT TO JOIN AND MY COLLEAGUES AND. ACCEPTING YOUR POLICY. TO THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I FOR ONE.
