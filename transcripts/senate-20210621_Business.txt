ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE TWENTY SEVEN. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THREE PRIMARY ISSUES NUMBER ONE ASSURING THE AVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. OF NEW CANNABIS CANNABINOID RELATED DRUGS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR MARKET FOLLOWING FDA APPROVAL AND SUBSEQUENT RESCHEDULING UNDER FEDERAL LAW. CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY ADOPTED THE SCHEDULING OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CONTAINING CONNECT CANNABIDIOL CANNABIDIOL THAT'S A HARD WORD SORRY SORRY ABOUT THAT- THERE- THEREBY ALLOWING FDA APPROVED THERAPIES TO BE AVAILABLE. HOWEVER SEVERAL OTHER CANNABIS DERIVED MEDICINES THAT CONTAIN CANNABINOIDS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND ENTERING THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS. THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT THESE DRUGS ONCE FDA APPROVED WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING FROM SUCH DEBILITATING DISEASES AS WELL AS- FOR EXAMPLE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. THE SECOND ISSUE WITHOUT FURTHER ALIGN FEDERAL LAW WITH CALIFORNIA LAW TO EXEMPT FROM SCHEDULING COMBINATION DRUGS WHERE THE RATIO OF CONTROLLED DRUG COMPONENT TO THE NON CONTROLLED INGREDIENTS. QUALIFIES THE DRUG PRODUCT FOR THE EXEMPTION. THE LACK OF CONSISTENCY BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW FOR THE SPECIFIC DRUG COMPOUNDS CREATES CONFUSIONS FOR PHARMACISTS PRESCRIBERS AND THE BOARD TO REGULATE THEM. THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF PHARMACY HAS REQUESTED THIS CHANGE TO PROVIDE CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY. AND THIRDLY CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION REMAINS IN THE GRIPS OF A NATIONAL PANDEMIC. THAT OF DRUG USE AND OVERDOSE DEATHS. AS A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL I FULLY SUPPORT THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED TO ENSURE THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTIFIABLE DATA. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SENSITIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS CONTROLLED CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE USE. IT'S IMPORTANT STATE STRATEGIES ADOPTABLE SEASON PRACTICES TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED UNNECESSARY USE OF RELEASE OF THIS INFORMATION. HOWEVER AS A SCIENTIST I ALSO SUPPORT THE ABILITY BUT INABILITY OF BONA FIDE RESEARCHERS TO CONDUCT MEANINGFUL RESEARCH. RECENT REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SEVERELY HINDER RESEARCH ACCESS TO STATEWIDE CURES DATA. AND IT AFFECTS STIFLE OR EVEN WHOLE POPULATION.

MORNING THANK YOU I WANT TO START BY THANKING GENERAL THING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND I WANT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS WHICH ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE BUREAU TO DEVELOP NECESSARY REGULATIONS. REQUIRED FOR NEW LICENSURE PROGRAM. EIGHTY FIVE OH ONE WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL OPTION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND GIVES ANOTHER CHOICE FOR BURIAL. THE MEASURE WOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO BE ORGANICALLY BECOME POLLS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE REDUCTION IN HUMAN REMAINS. AFTER IS THAT YOUR PROCESS IS COMPLETE FAMILY AND LOVED ONES OF THE SEASON I INTEGRATE THE REMAINS OF SOIL WHEN PLANTING A TREE OR GARDEN IN REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE A FEW REAL OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS COMMON OPTIONS INCLUDE TRADITIONAL BURIAL WHICH COUNTIES CHEMICALS WHEN THE TREATED WOOD AND THE EMBALMING PROCESS FROM THE GROUND. AND CREMATION WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR OVER 66% OF AFTER THAT CHOICES. IN CALIFORNIA AND EMIT CO TWO INTO THE ATMOSPHERE POLLUTING AIR. AND CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THE CONVENTIONAL VERY INTIMATE INFORMATION ARE PROFOUND IN THE UNITED STATES CEMETERIES TAKE UP ONE MILLION ACRES OF LAND. AND CAVITIES FOUR MILLION ACRES OF FOREST EVERY YEAR. THE BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. ON THE PHONE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. YOUR WITNESSES MAY PROCEED HELLO. HI THIS IS KATE AND GERRY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE I AM A FUNERAL DIRECTOR AND FUNERAL HOME OWNER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GIVING MY FULL SUPPORT THE BILL THIS PAST YEAR FUNERAL DIRECTING HAS BEEN A TOUGH BUSINESS THE PANDEMIC CAUSED EXTREME BACKUPS WITH CREMATORY RUNNING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND BURIAL NOT HAPPENING FOR MONTHS WE REALLY COULD HAVE DESPERATELY USED ADDITIONAL METHODS. OF BODY PROTECTION. NOT ONLY IS NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION ANOTHER OPTION FOR OUR FAMILIES IT'S AN OPTION THAT FOR MANY IS MORE IN LINE WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES. THE MAJORITY OF MY CLIENTS AND CALIFORNIANS IN GENERAL ARE CREMATED AT THE CREMATION DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE. AND INTRODUCING NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION ISN'T AN OPTION IS GOING TO CREATE A CALMER CLEANER MORE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FOR MY FAMILY AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. IT WILL BE LESS EXPENSIVE FOR WORKING FAMILIES BUT IN TRADITIONAL BURIAL I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS NEXT PLEASE. HELLO THIS IS KATRINA STATE. I'M FOUNDER AND CEO OF RECOMPOSED PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION FOCUSED ON PROVIDING NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION THANK YOU TO OUR BILL FOSTERED AND SUPPORTED IN CALIFORNIA FOR YOUR INTEREST IN BRINGING NEW END OF LIFE OPTIONS TO YOUR STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I LEARNED ABOUT DECADES OF RESEARCH AROUND THE PROCESS OF LIVESTOCK BY FARMERS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. THE PROCESS IS SIMPLE A BODY IS COVERED IN NATURAL MATERIALS LIKE STRAW AND WOOD CHIPS AND OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL WEEKS COULD DEFINITELY BROKEN DOWN INTO THE SOIL. MICROBIAL ACTIVITY. OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS TOGETHER WITH RESEARCHERS FROM SEVERAL MAJOR UNIVERSITIES WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE SAME PROCESS NOW CALLED NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION. AND EFFECTIVE FOR HUMAN DISPOSITION. IN ADDITION TO BEING A NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION IS SUSTAINABLE AND GENTLE ON THE PLANET. IT PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN CARBON EMISSIONS OVER CONVENTIONAL BURIAL OPTIONS YOU CAN GET THEM IN THE ENERGY EXCLAMATION I THINK OVER METRIC TON OF CARBON DIOXIDE PER PERSON TO CHOOSE. WASHINGTON STATE LEGALIZED NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHICH ALLOWED RECOMPOSED CIRCLE CAN OUR DOORS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. THE FILM TURNED OVER FORTY FIVE HUMANS INTO SOIL. IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO WORK WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES PROVIDING THEM WITH THE SAME LEVEL AND MEANINGFUL SEARCH WHAT. FINANCIAL TIMES OPERATING GROUP ALSO GENERATED FOURTEEN JOBS. IT'S REALLY EXCITING FOR ME TO BE AN ENTIRELY NEW CLEAR PATH COMBINING ECOLOGY HOSPITALITY AND END OF LIFE CARE COME TO LIGHT. FINALLY OVER TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WROTE IN A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND COLLABORATING WITH FILM DIRECTORS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIANS WANT MORE CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO THE END OF LIFE.

THAT'S NOTED ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS- SENATOR JOE BLOW DID YOUR MAKEUP OKAY CENTER PANEL FOR SERVICE THANK YOU THANK YOU THE SUMMER ACTUALLY GO SEE- FOR BRAINS BILL FORD AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THIS IS BEING ANOTHER OPTION FOR- FOR A FUNERAL- JESUS PERHAPS JUST TOUCH ON I THINK SOME CONCERN OF IN RACE IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE GUIDELINES FOR ACTUALLY THE- THE SOIL GETS CREATED- AND IT'S- DISPOSITION. ARE IS THERE ANY GUIDELINES THAT- THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR THAT- AND REALIZE SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE TO DO AS MUCH WITH PEOPLES- PERHAPS- SUPERSTITIONS ARE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO PUT IT BUT YOU KNOW. ABOUT TOOK PLACE IN HUMAN REMAINS- AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE BUT- PERHAPS YOU CAN SPEAK TO. THE GUIDELINES FOR DISPOSAL OF BASICALLY THE WHAT. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM SO IT'S CREATED. THANK YOU SO WE DID TAKE THEM IN TO GIVE THE BUREAU AN EXTRA YEAR TO IMPLEMENT THIS TO HELP DEVELOP WHAT THOSE GUIDELINES WOULD BE. MUCH LIKE WE'VE DEVELOPED GUIDELINES FOR WHEN WE ARE GOING TO. BE CREMATED BODY WHAT WE DO LITTLE FASCIST- AS WELL AND SO IT'S JUST ANOTHER OPTION I THINK FOR FOLKS WHO DO HAVE. MAYBE THIS MAY NOT ALIGN WITH THEIR VALUES ARE STILL FOR IT THEY DON'T HAVE TO USE THIS OPTION TO HAVE OTHER OPTIONS THAT MIGHT STILL FIT WITHIN THE VALLEY CENTER. SO I'M NOT. WANTING TO TAKE AWAY AN OPTION IT'S AN OPTION THAT I HAD ACTUALLY HAD A- LIVELY DISCUSSION WITH MY PARENTS OR THIS BILL THIS WEEKEND. MY MOM WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA AND MY DAD JUST COULDN'T. DEAL WITH IT- AND SO YOU KNOW IT HAS BROUGHT UP A LOT OF. A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS OF DEBATING CREATING ONE MORE OPTION IT IS ALSO A LITTLE. ENVIRONMENTALLY MORE FRIENDLY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO CONSIDER. OUT THERE- AND SO WE NEED THIS BILLS ALSO THEY'LL REFER TO HEALTH I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THERE AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO FIGURE OUT. SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS US TO KEEP INDIVIDUALS SAFE IN OUR COMMUNITY SAFE WHILE ALSO- BEING RESPECTFUL AND CREATING IN THE OPTIONS. SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER I THINK IT SAYS MUCH. NOT JUST THE PERSON ARE THE FAMILY. THAT MADE DECISION TO CHOOSE THIS OPTION- MAY BE OTHER P. WHO HAVE. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WE THAT PEOPLE'S. ASHES OVER YOU KNOW FLORISTS AND- RIVERS AND- OCEANS AND SO FORTH- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK SOME PEOPLE MAY EXPRESS SOME DISCOMFORT NOT KNOWING THAT THEY MAY BE IN. A PLACE WHERE- SOMEONE'S REMAINS WERE AT SO IN TERMS OF THE DISPOSITION AGAIN SELF. APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR VANS- CINNAMON AT THE SAME ISSUE SO- CENTER PARENTS KNOW GOT ME CURIOUS SO I SIMPLY WONDER SHOULD I DO HAVE A QUESTION THAT THERE ARE. THE PARTS OF OUR BODIES THAT DON'T NATURALLY DECOMPOSE- TEETH FILLINGS ASSUMED BONES. THAT SO HOW. HOW DOES IT ALL WORKS OR MECHANICALLY- SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE MOST ABOUT IT TURNS TO SO QUICKLY BUT WHAT WHAT ABOUT THOSE PARTS THAT DON'T WORK HOW DO WE DISPOSE OF THOSE THINGS. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS THANK YOU AND IN FAITH- THE TRAVEL OUT IF I COULD HAVE ONE OF THE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK THE FIFTH PERSON. YEAH THE FIFTH BETWEEN PAID FOR TALKING ABOUT NON ORGANIC MATERIAL THAT- THAT AREN'T BROKEN DOWN DURING NATURAL ORGANIC. PRODUCTION IS THAT TRUE. THAT'S THE QUESTION BACK I THINK IT'S BOTH MINUTES IT'S NOT GOING TO MATERIALS AND IT'S THOSE PARTS OF THE BODY THAT DON'T NATURALLY DECOMPOSE AT THE SAME RATE. AS OTHER PARTS OF. YES DURING NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION ALL ORGANIC MATERIALS INCLUDING BONES AND TEETH ARE BROKEN DOWN. AND THAT'S A FACTOR OF. HI HI SPEED THAT CREATED DURING THE MICROBIAL ACTIVITY- AND TO REPLICATE THAT OPERATORS USE TO ENSURE THE PERFECT ENVIRONMENT TO- ENTERED MY CREDIT. FOR NON ORGANIC SUCH AS ATTACKING IN HIM OR- DENTAL WORK. JUST LIKE IN CREMATION THERE'S A SCREENING AND SORTING PROCESS THAT HAPPENS. AND BELIEVE THOSE MATERIALS ARE RECYCLED- THERE ARE COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT WORK WITH CREMATORY TODAY. THAT RECYCLED METALS. FROM THE BODY AFTER CREMATION. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU SIR CEREBRAL. YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIR- AND TAKE IT TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THERE ARE THOSE IN MY FAMILY WHO ARE ALSO VERY EAGER TO USE THIS AND I SO I GUESS IT'S JUST INTERESTING AS AS WE ARE ALSO TALKING A LOT ABOUT- THAT. THE WASTE AND AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR BODIES AND AT THE END OF OUR LIFE AND MIGHT COME SO ANYWAY THIS IS JUST A I THINK ANOTHER STEP IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- WORK AROUND- ED REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF A OF UNNECESSARY WASTE IN CLOSING THE CYCLE- AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF THAT THAT I THINK IT'S FASTING AND OF COURSE LIKE MANY THINGS IT MAKES PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE WE START TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT OF COURSE THIS IS THE MOST NATURAL WAY I THINK EVER OF BEING ABLE TO DISPOSE OF A BODY IN THE- THANK YOU. EVERYBODY I MEAN THIS IS ABOUT AS ABOUT OPTIONS IS ABOUT CHOICES ABOUT. AND ALSO THE COST FACTOR I MEAN THERE IS A- D. AT. THE DEATH. AT THE END OF OUR LIFE- BEARING SOMEBODY BURIED ANYBODY LIKES IT IS AND IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE- ON FAMILIES. AT THE END OF THE LIFE AND PUTTING A LOT MORE THINGS. INTO OUR GROUND SO ANYWAY IS AS WE TALK ABOUT. BE ONE MORE WAY OF BEING ABLE TO. HAVE THE SAY IN OUR LIFE ALL THE WAY TO THE END I THINK THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO. SAVE OUR EARTH AND DO THINGS IN A VERY NATURAL WAY. I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF I'M NOT ALREADY. THANK YOU SENATOR WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR NEWMAN SOME WOMEN MEMBER. SKEWS ME CENTER PANTOMIME AND THEN WE CAN SEE YOU. BETTER MEN. YEAH- SAID IT APPRECIATE THE BILL SOME MEMBER GARCIA I HAD A QUESTION JUST- I'M READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BILL. AND IT DESCRIBES- ON OUR ON OUR- PAGE FOR THAT- THE LIFE THE LICENSEES LIMITED TO FINAL DISPOSITION- REDUCE HUMAN REMAINS WITH A LICENSE CEMETERY BY BERLIN TO MEN FOR INTERNMENT- FOR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HER OWNERSHIP OF A CONSERVATION AREA WHERE THE REDUCTION FACILITY MAY LAWFULLY INTEGRATE THE REDUCED REMAINS INTO THE SOIL. IS THAT DOES THAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE DO WITH- CREMATION. PERMISSION AND ASK A QUESTION OF THE SEVEN MEMBER. YEAH I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME- I GUESS MAYBE JUST TO BOIL IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER- YOU KNOW IS IT THE SAME AS WHAT WE DO IS CREMATED ASHES OR ARE WE LOOKING AT SOME DIFFERENT SET OF CRITERIA AND GUIDANCE. ACCEPTED AT THIS IN MY VISION IT WOULD BE SIMILAR RETURN RETURN THESE- THE SOIL BACK TO THE FAMILY AND THEY GET TO. PUT IT IN RECENT RIGHT THERE STILL RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO FALL EVEN FALL EVEN WITH YOUR AND YOUR FAMILY'S ASHES. I THINK THE SAME THING WITH THE WITH THE SOIL TO THE DEPARTMENT WOULD CREATE GUIDELINES OF WHAT THAT HI HE SAID AND MAYBE TO- I APOLOGIZE WHAT WE NEED TO DISCLOSE HIS WEALTH WITH IT'S HAPPENING HOW YOU REGISTER THAT. SO THIS IS ALL PART OF WHAT THE BUREAU WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP- BUT I THINK IT'S CREATING AN OPTION I THINK CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS OF WHAT WE DO AT THE END OF OUR LIFE AND IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT OFTEN TEND TO OUR FATE. TO HAVE- I'M THE CARETAKER FOR MY PARENTS AND FROM MY UNCLE INTO THE CONVERSATION I'VE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH- FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS SINCE I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH A WHOLE HOST OF THE HEALTH CRISIS OUT WITH THEM AND SO. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A SPACE WHERE WE KEEP COMMUNITIES HELPING SAVE CREATURES OF FAMILIES BUT WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR EXPERTS OF WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE BEST YEAH AND THEN IT'S JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT- I DIDN'T SEE THIS AND MAYBE I JUST MISSED IT I APOLOGIZE IF SO- IS THERE. GUIDANCE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING TO THE BUREAU OTHER THAN JUST A SORT OF ADOPT THE SAME GUIDELINES EXCLAMATION I ONLY ASK THAT BECAUSE- I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT IN MY COMMUNITY. AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS DIFFERENT CULTURES WITH DIFFERENT ATTITUDES ON ON DEATH AND REMAINS THAT MIGHT VIEW THESE TYPES OF REMAINS IS DIFFERENT THAN ASHES AND TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO'S POINT. THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE LEGITIMATE RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL OR SPIRITUAL CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING THESE TYPES. REMAINS LIKE RIGHT NEAR THEM AND I GUESS- I'M I'M KERRY IF THERE A- GUIDANCE THAT GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND JUST. THE IT POLICY. WORKING IN. TO BE TODAY THEIR- AND POLICIES. I LOVE THAT MADE SENSE AND I TALKED. EARLY ON A MONDAY NO I MEAN I UNDERSTAND I THINK THE DISCUSSION ALSO ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WHAT WE DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC AND NOT AND I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LEVEL OF THIS CLOSER THAT IS. OUT THERE- AND THAT IS A FAIR DISCUSSION TO BE HAD THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH I WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE BUREAU ON WHAT THESE WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE LOOK LIKE THEY USED TO HAVE AN OPEN PROCESS I THINK IT GIVES PEOPLE SPACE TO PARTICIPATE. IN THAT AS WELL. ALONG THE WAY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RELIGION- YOU KNOW THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TO SOMEONE IS TO BE CREMATED EITHER- AND SO. IT'S AND PEOPLE STILL MAKE THAT CHOICE EVEN WITHIN THAT RELIGION BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT FOR THEM AND- THEIR FAMILIES AND WHAT THEY DO WITH THE FASCIST. THAT THE DISCUSSION. OFTEN TIME WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OUT THERE WHAT HAPPENS. NEXT AND SO I THINK IT'S FAIR THAT. WE KNOW WHAT'S IN OUR BACKYARD LITERALLY. NINE FIFTEEN THAT DISCLOSURES FOR I WILL SAY FOR EXAMPLE TO THIS BILL LET DISCOVERED. THAT WERE ALLOWED TO BURY IT TO FIVE PEOPLE IN A BACKYARD IN THIS YOUR CITY OR COUNTY HAS PASSED AN ORDINANCE THAT. MODIFIES THAT HE DO THE RIGHT TO SAY THAT AND PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT THIS IS NEXT TO YOU IN YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY OUT THERE. AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SPACES WHERE WE EXPECTED AND THINGS AND THERE'S ACTUALLY. A LOT MORE LATITUDE THAN WE WOULD REALIZE. I APPRECIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HELLO OKAY SIR ARCHULETA- YES- QUESTION PROBABLY FOR THE DIRECTOR THE FUNERAL HOME MORE THAN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ACT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS THE PROCEDURE- WE TALKED ABOUT THE FAMILIES AND- THE SENSITIVITY THE FAMILIES WOULD WOULD THERE BE A NORMAL- VANTAGE AS WE ALL ARE CUT FROM THE SCENE AND THEN THIRTY DAYS LATER WHEN IT'S COMPLETE IS THERE ANOTHER CEREMONY- CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH WHAT WOULD BE. A SORT OF A CEREMONY I MEAN IT- USUALLY THERE'S GRAVESITE AND THEN THE CASKET IS- IS PUT IN THE GROUND OR THERE'S- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY WHAT WOULD TAKE PLACE WHEN WITH THE FAMILIES ACTUALLY MOURN WOULD IT BE AT THE END OF THIRTY DAYS IN THE BEGINNING. WHAT'S THE PROCEDURE I GUESS WHAT SO LET'S HAVE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ERIC THAT AND THEN RE DIRECT THAT IF YOU WOULD. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S ON THE LINE AT ALL ALL. AT ONE THIRTY THAT FUNERAL DIRECTOR SO I CAN I CAN STEP IN WHATEVER'S APPROPRIATE. YES AND I WOULD SAY WHEN WE MOURN OUR FAMILY MEMBER AUSTIN TEXAS UP TO THAT. FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENS OFTEN TIMES WITH CREMATION DO WE DO IT AHEAD OF TIME AFTERWARDS WE DO WE DO IT TWICE. I'VE I'VE I'VE HAD. I PARTICIPATED IN VARIATIONS OF THAT AS WELL BUT I WILL ALLOW THE DIRECTOR TO CHAIRMAN. AND DIRECTOR. YEAH THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION AND THIS IS A REALLY FASCINATING TIME TO BE A PART OF THE FUNERAL INDUSTRY. BECAUSE THINGS ARE CHANGING AND THERE ARE NEW IDEAS AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT. BUT AS I WILL SAY I DO MOSTLY CREMATION. OR NATURAL BURIALS WHICH IS JUST A BOTTOM STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND- AND- NORMALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU TEND TO HAVE A VIEWING AFTER THE TONE BECAUSE PEOPLE DO YOU WANT TO BE WITH THE PHYSICAL BODY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE SO MUCH ABOUT THE IDEA OF NATURAL ORGANIC REDUCTION IS THAT POLICING THE BODY INTO THE VESSEL. TO BE TO BE REDUCED TO SOIL. IS SUCH A- BEAUTIFUL CALMING WAY BECAUSE CREMATORY LET'S BE HONEST TEND TO BE VERY LOUD TEND TO BE VERY INDUSTRIAL SO WHEN WE HAVE FAMILIES COME TO WITNESS THE BODY BEING PLACED INTO THE CREMATION CHAMBER. SOMETIMES I CAN BE A PRETTY INTENSE EXPERIENCE. BUT IT'S SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A TRADITIONAL BURIAL AND GRAVESIDE SERVICE THAT A LOT OF FAMILIES YOU KNOW HOW TO CHOOSE CREMATION BUT IN THIS CASE. BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION MEANS THEY HAVE A MUCH. NICER ABILITY TO HAVE A CEREMONY PRIOR TO THE BODY BEING INSERTED INTO THE VESSEL AND THEN AFTER THE THIRTY DAYS ONCE THE SOIL COMES BACK. YOU CAN HAVE A MEMORIAL SERVICE SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER CREMATION FOR THE ASHES ARE SCATTERED. AND A QUICK- RETURNS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WITH THE DISCUSSION I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO HOW CREMATED REMAINS ARE HANDLED CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS SOME OF THE MOST STRICT LAWS AROUND HANDLING THE CREMATED REMAINS. PRIOR OR AFTER THE CREMATION TAKES PLACE THAN ANY OTHER STATE SO I IMAGINE THE SAME SORT OF STRICT LAWS AND PERMITS AND PROCEDURES WILL ALSO BE CARRIED OVER INTO. THE HANDLING OF THESE ORGANIC REMAINS. THANK YOU MUCH FOR. THANK YOU SIR OKAY COLLEAGUES FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS LAST CALL. SEEING NONE.
