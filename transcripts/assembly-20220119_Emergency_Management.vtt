00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.958
EVALUATING THE PROBLEM NUMBER

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.927
ONE. WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM.

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:38.730
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CAUSES AND

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:39.764
EFFECTS OF THE PROBLEM- WHOSE

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:41.899
PROBLEM IS THAT. IT WHAT IS THE

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:44.469
MOTIVATION TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I

00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:46.004
DEFINITELY WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.172
CONSIDER A FEW FACTORS RELATED

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.641
TO DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS. ARE

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:52.844
THERE ANY SHORT TIME IS VERY

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.480
SHORT TERM FIXES. ARE AT THEIR-

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:57.915
LONG TERM SOLUTIONS SOME OF THE

00:31:57.982 --> 00:31:59.684
PROBLEMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.786
TODAY IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT TIME R.

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:02.620
M. S. PERSONNELOF FIRST

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.588
RESPONDERS ARE STUCK IN

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.757
HOSPITALS WITH PATIENTS UNTIL

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:07.558
THE HOSPITAL STAFF TAKES MEDICAL

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.427
CONTROL OF THE PATIENT AND THEN

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:12.163
WILL SAYS ARE PUT BACK TO THE IN

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.065
THE SYSTEM. WHAT IS THE COST I'M

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:16.034
GONNA TALK ON SOME OF THESE

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.101
ANIMALS. BUT WHAT ARE THE

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:18.369
EFFECTS OF THE FIRE SERVICE. THE

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.738
FACT. IS THE EXTENT OF ALL TIME

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:23.241
IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE FINITE

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:24.442
RESOURCES SUCH AS A RELIGIOUS

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:27.312
EMS PERSONNEL. ARE TAKEN OUT OF

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:28.579
THE EMS SYSTEM. WE CANNOT

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.248
RESPOND TO OTHER NINE ONE ONE

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:32.283
EMERGENCY IS ESSENTIALLY TO FAX

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.886
THE NINE ONE ONE READINESS. THIS

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:36.888
HAPPENS IN A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:38.389
. BLACK REGENCIES ARE ON SCENE

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:40.124
LONGER FOR CALLS WAITING FOR A

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:42.593
RELIGIOUS WHICH ARE STUCK IN

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.995
HOSPITALS. THIS AGAIN DECREASES

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:45.430
THE READINESS TO RESPOND TO

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:48.266
EMERGENCIES. IN ADDITION. FIRE

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.168
PERSONNEL OFTEN FOLLOW UP WITH

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:51.636
THE PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:53.404
WHICH REDUCES STAFFING ON FIRE

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.406
EQUIPMENT. THIS IS GOING TO

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.508
REDUCE OUR ABILITY AND

00:32:57.575 --> 00:32:58.643
EFFECTIVENESS TO RESPOND AND

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.578
MITIGATE OTHER CALLS FOR SERVICE

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.413
SUCH AS FIRES WILDLAND FIRES

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.082
RESCUES HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.084
INCIDENTS AND OTHER MEDICAL

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.454
EMERGENCIES. SO THIS PROBLEM IS

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.856
IT. WELL AS WE ALL KNOW A LOT OF

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:13.691
THE DATA THAT'S OUT THERE WOULD

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.827
INDICATE THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:17.995
WIDE PROBLEM HOWEVER IF YOU READ

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:19.964
EIGHTY- A DOCUMENT THAT WAS

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.466
PRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:33:21.532 --> 00:33:22.333
FOURTEEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.634
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:25.536
PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.271
MERCY MEDICAL SERVICES A FLORIDA

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.773
CAL EMSA PUBLISHED A PAPER

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.676
CALLED THE TOOL KIT TO REDUCE

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:32.510
AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD IT

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:35.780
DELAYS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.348
. THIS TOOL KIT I. MANY

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:38.549
ASSOCIATED FACTORS CAUSING

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:41.552
DELAYS SUCH AS DECREASED PATIENT

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:43.888
OR IMPATIENT CAPACITY. NURSE

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:45.857
PATIENT RATIOS POSSIBLE

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:47.692
REGULATIONS LIMITING AREAS ARE

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.827
CARE INABILITY TO RAPIDLY TURN

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:52.430
OVER HOSPITAL BEDS AND THE LIST

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:54.265
GOES ON AND ON. EXACTLY

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:56.267
IDENTIFIES A LOT OF THE

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:57.702
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS AND SUGGEST

00:33:57.769 --> 00:34:01.606
THAT THESE ARE- ALL PROBLEMS ARE

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.141
FOUND IN THE HOSPITAL'S NOT

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.977
NECESSARILY ON ON THE NINE ONE

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:10.148
ONE SIDE OF- EMS. SO WHAT IS THE

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:11.048
MOTIVATION FOR HOSPITALS TO

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:13.084
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WELL THE

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:16.421
PROBLEM IS A LOT OF THESE ISSUES

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:18.189
ARE ARE SO. ISSUES IN OTHER

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:20.558
WORDS THEY ARE REAL WE'RE

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:24.295
RELYING ON OLD- TYPES OF SYSTEMS

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.297
THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY. I THINK

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:27.265
TWO OTHER FACTORS NEED TO BE

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:29.100
THEY'RE WHEN ASKED THIS QUESTION

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:30.735
SO WHO'S HOLDING THE HOSPITAL'S

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:33.337
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS OR

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:35.606
INACTIONS. AND THEN ARE THERE

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:36.707
INCENTIVES TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:38.009
CHANCE OF THE FIRST QUESTION IT

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:39.010
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:40.011
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.879
OVERSIGHT OF HOSPITALS ARE

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:43.648
CURRENTLY HOLDING THEM

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:45.983
ACCOUNTABLE FOR. FOR A PART

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.020
ISSUES AND PAY AND ALL TIME.

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.555
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ARE THERE

00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:52.490
INCENTIVES TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:53.658
WOULD SAY HELLO BECAUSE PRIVATE

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:56.027
AMBULANCES AND FIRE AGENCIES

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:57.728
DON'T CHARGE HOSPITALS FOR LOST

00:34:57.795 --> 00:35:00.097
TIME WALLACE SAID ON THE WALL.

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:02.500
BEGIN TAKING THEM OUT OF THE

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:03.601
NINE ONE SYSTEM AND THE FIRE

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:04.802
SERVICE AND PRIVATE AMBULANCE

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:06.404
PROVIDERS. SEEMS TO BE

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:09.707
SUBSIDIZING THE HOSPITALS A LOT

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:10.741
OF REGARDS. SO ARE THERE ARE

00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:13.644
SHORT TERM FIXES AND LONG TERM

00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:15.646
SOLUTIONS. YES WE BELIEVE SO.

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.682
SOME OF THE SHORT TERM FIXES THE

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.050
CONSIDER OUR HOLD HOSPITALS

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:20.918
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AN

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:23.454
ACT IN ACTIONS WHEN IT LOOKS AT

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:25.790
THE ABILITY TO FIX SOME OTHER

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:28.092
INTERNAL PROBLEMS AND SO ON AND

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:30.595
SO FORTH. ALSO DISINCENTIVE THE

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:32.396
HOSPITAL STOCKHOLDER MERCY

00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.365
PERSONNEL THE HOSPITALS WHICH IS

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:36.467
IT IS IN ESSENCE UTILIZING

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.503
PUBLIC TAXPAYER FUNDS TO

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:39.871
SUBSIDIZE THESE HOSPITALS AND

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:41.105
SHIFT THE BURDEN TO OTHER

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.641
AGENCIES. MANDATORY REPORTING

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.910
AND DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS SO

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.778
WE CAN BETTER IDENTIFY THE

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:50.181
PROBLEM AND FUTURE SOLUTIONS.

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:52.383
DEFINITELY SOME OF THE LONG TERM

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.918
SOLUTIONS WE LIKE TO LOOK AT AND

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.753
YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT- GERMAN

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.422
RODRIGUEZ THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:01.526
HAVE A VERY OUTDATED EMS SYSTEM.

00:36:01.592 --> 00:36:04.328
THE HOSPITALS ARE ARE ONLY ABLE

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.897
TO DO WHAT THEY CAN DO BASED

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:07.632
UPON THE SYSTEM THE EMS

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:09.901
PROVIDERS ARE ONLY ABLE TO DO

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.636
WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO- IN THE

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:13.804
SYSTEM AS WELL AND WE ARE

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.506
CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER A

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:16.674
FORTY TWO YEAR OLD EMS SYSTEM

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:19.610
WHICH IS WHICH IS WOEFULLY.

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.079
OUTDATED AND DOES LITTLE TO GIVE

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.948
HOSPITALS AND EMS PROVIDERS THE

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.850
TOOLS WE NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEM

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:28.753
IN FACT. THE REGULATIONS THAT

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.288
WERE THAT WERE WORKING ON A

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:32.156
RIGHT NOW ARE FROM NINETEEN

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:33.090
EIGHTY AND IT IS REALLY

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:35.560
DIFFICULT TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:36.561
TODAY BASED UPON- THESE

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.396
REGULATIONS. TRANSIENCE SYSTEM

00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:40.264
IS FAILING BECAUSE OF AN

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.999
OUTDATED REGULATIONS INCREASED

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.435
DEMAND FOR SERVICE. LACK OF

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:46.504
INNOVATION AND A LACK OF WILL TO

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:47.905
FIX THE PROBLEM CALIFORNIA WAS

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.140
INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING THE

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.509
EMS SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES.

AND TAKE THE STEPS NEEDED TO

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.683
CREATE A BETTER SYSTEM FOR

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:00.484
TOMORROW AND CONTINUE

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.205
AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION

ARE FOCUS. ON SYMPTOMS RATHER

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:13.257
THAN THE DISEASE OVER WITH COST

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:14.325
. WE RECOGNIZE WITH MO DISEASE

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:15.793
THE TRIP PATHWAY NEED TO BE

WALL TIMES CONTINUED IN ACROSS

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:21.799
THE STATE. ONE OF THE MOST

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:23.501
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS IS THE

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:24.502
AMBULANCE DELAYS THAT ARE

OCCURRING IN OUR COMMUNITIES ON

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:28.472
A DAILY BASIS. THIS IS THAT THIS

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:30.107

THE NEXT RESPONDED THIS CALL WAS

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:31.682
NOT A SACRAMENTO. EIGHT MILES

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.784
AWAY THREE CITIES OVER THANK

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:35.419

TO US IT WAS ABLE TO GIVE US AN

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:40.190
AMBULANCE TO TRANSPORT THIS

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:42.192
PATIENT. BUT THEY WERE TWENTIETH

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.928
IN THE PIC FOR AMBULANCES

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:46.463

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.031
AMBULANCE THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.466
RESPONDED TO THIS CALL. WALKABLE

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:52.403
TO AMBULANCES SAT JUST A BLOCK

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:56.140
AWAY. ON THE WALL. ALLEN THIS

00:42:56.206 --> 00:42:58.509
NEIGHBORING AGENCY GAVE US THEIR

00:42:58.575 --> 00:42:59.977
AMBULANCE THEY ALSO OPENED UP

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:03.113
VERY ENTIRE DISTRICT. AND MADE

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.248
ALL OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:07.818
VULNERABLE. SO I WANT TO MAKE

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:10.688
THIS POINT THAT THIS IS THESE

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.923
ARE TAXPAYER RESOURCES THAT ARE

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.658
BEING USED RIGHT NOW TO STAFF

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:16.860
HOSPITALS THIS IS NOTHING SHORT

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:18.862
OF CRIMINAL THESE ANIMALS ARE

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:21.298
BEING HELD ON THE WALLS UP TO

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:23.133
EIGHT NINE HOURS AT A TIME AND

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.002
THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:27.404
AND THIS ISN'T AN ALL OPEN

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.306
PROBLEM THIS IS BEEN GOING ON

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:31.508
FOR OVER A DECADE IN OUR REGION

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:33.777
IF WE HAD SOLVED THIS PROBLEM IN

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:34.979
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.981
WOULDN'T BE IS BOUND UP AS WE

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.582
ARE RIGHT NOW. AND MOVING IN THE

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:41.285
AMBULANCE FROM THE SYSTEM MAKES

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:45.055
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WORKS. HAVING

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:46.557
ONE AMBULANCE IT ON THE WALL

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:47.891
JUST REMOVES ONE MEDICAL

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:48.826
RESOURCE FROM THE ENTIRE

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.828
COMMUNITY IT ALSO CREATES

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:51.829
INCREASES THE PATIENT'S

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.764
CRITICALITY MEANING THAT EVERY

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.699
MINUTE COUNTS AND WE MAY RESPOND

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:57.835
TO A MINOR PATIENT BUT IF WE

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.003
TAKE MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:01.205
MINUTES TO GET IN THE HOSPITAL

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:02.239
THAT MAY TURN INTO A CRITICAL

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.375
PATIENT THEN OCCUPIES. AND I

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:07.511
ZERO. SO QUICK SMART GOAL FOR

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.613
SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE TO MOVE

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.416
FORWARD. I QUIT THIS CHIU THE

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:15.386
OLDER OSHA LAWS THAT FINES WERE

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.321
REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:21.225
CHANGED BEHAVIOR AND UNDER TITLE

00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:22.593
TWENTY TWO WE HAVE THE ABILITY

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:26.563
TO UP. IT FIND THE HOSPITAL'S

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.298
FOR ANYTIME THE HOLES OVER THE

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:30.434
WALL FOR OVER TWENTY MINUTES. WE

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.002
ALSO HAVE THAT SAME ABILITY IN

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:34.104
THE HIT HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE.

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:36.073
AND ALSO TO REPORT DEMAND AS

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.709
ADVERSE EFFECTS TRUE A TRANSFER

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:40.844
OF CARE COULD NOT TAKE ANY MORE

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:42.379
THAN TWENTY MINUTES IN ANY AND

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:44.114
EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS THE

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:45.816
HOSPITAL SHOULD BE FINE AND HELD

00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:46.784
ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT MAY BE THE

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.420
ONLY THING. THAT GETS INTO

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:53.157

PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM

00:48:01.378 --> 00:48:03.347
WHICH IS A GOOD THING FOR THE

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:06.550
HOSPITAL. IT'S A GOOD THING FOR

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:08.151
THE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE EACH

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.081
TRANSFERRED TO A COMPREHENSIVE

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:40.384
STROKE CENTER SO WHAT HAS BEEN

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.885
ONE TOOL THAT IS I'M GIVEN A

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:44.521
MINOR RELIEF BUT IT'S THE SMALL.

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:46.056
THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH

HOSPITALS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF A

AT MOST MOST PATIENTS COME IN

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.023
WITH A GOOD PAIR SOURCE. SO

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.992
AGAIN THAT'S A FINANCIAL

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.160
INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO KEEP THE

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:25.395
AMBULANCE IS- MOVIE. SO ANY

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.497
CONTRACT WITH THE NINE ONE ONE

WE HAVE BEEN TRYING. TO

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:35.739
IMPLEMENT THOSE THAT OUR SYSTEM-

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:38.075
BUT THEY SHOULD BE BE REQUIRED

TO PAY THE AMBULANCE COMPANY FOR

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:42.112
WAITING TIMES. ARE A SPEAR NOT

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:43.880
NECESSARILY THE HOSPITALS ARE

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:46.350
ALREADY OVER REGULATED THERE ARE

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.752
ALREADY PUNISHED WITH FINANCIAL.

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.420
PUNISHMENTS WHICH IS NOT THE

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:53.123
ANSWER BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.759
TO PAY A FAIR WAGE I TO THAT

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.928
ONE'S COMPANY. THAT IS WAITING

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.363
FOR WE WERE LOOKING A OVER AN

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:01.398
HOUR. THE COMPANY SHOULD BE

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:03.367
ALLOWED TO BUILD FOR THE

00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:04.701
INDIVIDUAL HE SHOT THAT THEIR

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:11.308
CITY WEST. ON THIS CAN BE DONE.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.076
TO WHERE IT WHEN THE P. CO THEN

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:15.545
ARE SIGN IN BY THE- AND THE M.

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:16.813
COMPANY. OUT BY NURSE AND THE

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.084
AWG CARE RECORD WITH THAT TIME-IS THAT MAN INTO THE HOSPITAL

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:23.120
WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND THERE IS

00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:24.921
A FAIR RATE THAT IS PAID TO THE

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.590
AMBULANCE COMPANY. OFF FOR THEIR

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:28.425
STAFF AND HAVING THE AMBULANCE

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.627
WAITING AND BEING OUT OF SERVICE

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.028
THIS WOULD BRING THE ISSUE TO

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:34.631
THE LEVEL OF THE C. E. O. AND

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:37.134
THEN THE CBO OVER THE COMPANY

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.836
WHAT- I THINK THEY WOULD BE ABLE

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:41.204
TO PUT PROCESSES IN PLACE TO

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.839
MOVE THE AMBULANCES AND RELEASE

00:50:42.906 --> 00:50:46.343
THEM. MORE QUICKLY HOSPITALS ONE

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.145
OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:49.880
HAD IN OUR SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:51.448
HELPFUL ESPECIALLY DURING THIS

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:53.717
CALL BIG PANDEMIC. HAS HAVING

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:56.720
HOSPITALS HIRE EMTS ALBION'S OR

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.221
OTHER MEDICAL STAFF TO MONITOR

00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.656
THE PATIENT'S AND RELIEVE THE

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.291
AMBULANCES AND GET THEM BACK

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:03.126
INTO SERVICE MORE QUICKLY.

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:04.628
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.430
HOSPITALS CANNOT HIRE THIS

00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:08.832
ADDITIONAL STAFF TO YOU RELEASED

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:14.971
THE AMBULANCES ARE AND LIKE. I

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.506
SAID WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.208
WITH THAT. WE DON'T STAY ON THE

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:19.443
HOSP- ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:20.811
WE DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM TO

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:22.913
ENSURE THAT THE HOSPITAL CAMPUS

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:24.881
ADDITIONAL STAFF. SO WE ARE NOT

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:27.117
ON THE HOSPITAL WE NOTICED THAT

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:29.052
THE HOSPITAL THEY MOVE ON TO

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.954
OTHER THINGS THEY GET OTHER

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:32.456
PRIORITIES AND THESE THE STAFF

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:33.824
BEING EXTRA STAFFING SEEMS TO GO

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.293
AWAY. SO AGAIN THAT WOULD BE A

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:38.929
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION THAT UP

00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:41.064
IN A SYSTEMS CAN POINT INTO WORK

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:42.666
SOME OTHER MECHANISMS TO ENSURE

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:44.568
THE HOSPITAL HOW DOES IT IS JUST

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:50.340
NOT STOPPING. SO ALL. PRACTICES

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:52.409
NOT PUNISHING HOSPITALS WE NEED

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.144
TO WORK AS A TEAM WITH THE

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:56.379
HOSPITAL'S DIVERTING SPECIALTY

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:58.381
CARE PATIENTS ALLOWING AMBULANCE

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.517
COMPANIES TO BILL I THINK AFTER

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.786
MY THIRTY YEARS HERE AT IT

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:04.921
WITHIN THE EMS AGENCY AND

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:06.823
WORKING WITH THE IS A POT ISSUES

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.192
AND TOOL KITS- I THINK THAT THIS

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:12.028
IS A MORE REASONABLE RESPONSE

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:13.630
AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT A

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:15.499
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THE

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.133
HOSPITAL TO BE ABLE TO MOVE

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.903
THESE PATIENTS SO IN CONCLUSION.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.705
WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE HOSPITAL

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:23.106
SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:25.342
MISSION OF CARING FOR THE SICK

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:26.910
AND INJURED ANOTHER THINK RING

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:29.045
COBIT HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN MADE

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:31.014
TO BE POSSIBLE FOR SOCIAL

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.083
ASPECTS OF PATIENTS GETTING

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.685
HOMELESS OF PEOPLE CONNECTED ALL

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.387
OF THESE THINGS ARE NOT

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.421
NECESSARILY BUT THE HOSPITAL

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:39.956
SHOULD BE DOING MENTAL HEALTH

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:41.858
PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE IN THE

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.460
HOSPITAL'S HOSPITAL SHOULD BE

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:46.696
CARING FOR THE SICK AND THE-

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:48.565
INJURED. AT THE THAT SHOULD NOT

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:49.833
HAPPEN RIGHT. FORCED ON THAT

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.302
ADDRESS SOCIAL ISSUES WE NEED TO

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.604
SUPPORT OUR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS.

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:55.872
AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:58.308
SURE THAT THEY REMAIN VIABLE AND

00:52:58.375 --> 00:52:59.743
THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:01.311
THEIR MISSIONS TO TRANSPORT THE

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:02.979
SICK AND INJURED. AND FINALLY WE

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.881
NEED TO IDENTIFY A MECHANISM TO

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:06.249
ENSURE THAT THE HOSPITAL'S

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:08.218
PURELY PAY OFF FOR THE AMBULANCE

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:09.753
PROVIDERS AND FIRE DEPARTMENT

00:53:09.819 --> 00:53:12.422
STAFF- THAT ARE WAITING AND

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:14.257
AGAIN I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:15.692
NEEDS TO BE A FINANCIAL

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:18.361
INCENTIVE. I TO GET THE

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:20.497
HOSPITAL'S TO YOU TO MOVE ON

PERSPECTIVE- PUTS ON THE GROUND

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.048
WORK FORCE. I'M HERE TO TALK

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:19.949
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF WALL TIMES

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.017
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND HOW

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.319
IT AFFECTS OUR PATIENTS MY

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:24.187
FELLOW EMS PROVIDERS. AND THE

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:28.191
IMPLICATIONS. WORKFORCE FIRST

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:30.460
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WHILE TIMES

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:31.794
ARE NOON IT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.429
PROBLEM FOR AS LONG AS I CAN

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:34.230
REMEMBER. EVERY WINTER FLU

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.100
SEASON WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.267
TOO MANY PATIENTS NOT ENOUGH

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.236
BEDS NURSES. I CAN REMEMBER BACK

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.304
TEN YEARS STANDING ON THE WALL

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:42.438
CENTER ROADS WILL BE OFFERED

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:43.973
SNACKS BECAUSE WE'D BEEN THERE

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.009
FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. MOST

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:48.211
RECENTLY THE WALL TIME ISSUE HAS

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.879
GOTTEN WORSE I THINK BECAUSE WE

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.714
HAVEN'T HAD A BREAK FROM

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:53.349
BREAKING THE COOPERATE. THIS

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.784
PROBLEM IS TWO FOLD IN MY

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.452
OPINION THE MOST IMPORTANT THE

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.654
IMPACT OUR PATIENTS IT IS

01:00:58.721 --> 01:00:59.689
UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE HAVE

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:01.991
PATIENTS. PATIENTS LAYING ON OUR

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.559
EARNINGS FOR HOURS SOME AS LONG

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.495
AS EIGHT. AND THEN IN A HALLWAY

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:07.864
AT THE ER A GOOD PORTION OF THE

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:08.798
TIME THEY'RE EDERLY PEOPLE WITH

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:11.634
DISEASE PROCESS. AT HAS BEEN

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:13.736
BEDRIDDEN AND UNABLE TO SIT IN A

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.038
WHEELCHAIR IN THE WAITING ROOM

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.305
THEY'RE STUCK O OUR JOURNEYS

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:17.974
WHICH ARE NOT MADE FOR COMFORT.

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.275
THEY'RE MADE FOR EASE OF USE OF

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.910
USED DURING AN EMERGENCY THE

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.245
PATIENTS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE THEY

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:24.247
START COMPLAIN OF PAIN. SOME OF

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.448
THEM HAVE ALZHEIMER'S OR

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.682
DEMENTIA SO THEY BECOME

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:29.285
INCREASINGLY CONFUSED- MOST OF

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.020
THE ARTS HAVE A SUITE IN A

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.155
HALLWAY BY A DOOR SO THE

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:34.057
PATIENTS GET COLD OR HOT

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.024
DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER. THEN

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.492
WE HAVE THE PROBLEM OF THE

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:37.994
PATIENTS NEEDING TO USE THE

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.395
RESTROOM. AGAIN ATTORNEYS ARE

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.364
NEED TO BE USED AS LONG TERM

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.865
BEDS FOR PATIENTS SO TRYING TO

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:46.202
GET THEM ON THE BENCH. IS

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:47.170
DIFFICULT. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.805
THE IMPACT OF THE FIELD WORKERS.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.473
MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE STANDING

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.408
IN THE HALLWAY. FOR HOURS WITH

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.243
NO WHERE TO SET OUR FEET BACK

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.045
LEGS AND HIPS START TO HURT. OUR

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.547
JOB IS ALREADY TAXING ON OUR

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:59.382
BODIES. BUT SPENDING HOURS UPON

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:02.218
HOURS STANDING IN ONE SPOT. IS

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:02.952
MAKING AN IMPACT ON OUR BODIES

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.854
EVEN WORKS. WE ARE UNABLE TO

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.956
TAKE BREAKS UNABLE TO EAT UNABLE

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:08.324
TO GET A DRINK. THEN YOU HAVE

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.226
THE REST OF THE CREWS OUT IN THE

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.994
STREETS HAVING TO COVER THE-

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.196
COVER EVEN MORE CALLS. BECAUSE

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:15.231
THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:15.998
AMBULANCES AVAILABLE TO RUN THE

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.567
CALLS. BECAUSE SO MANY

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:18.167
AMBULANCES ARE SITTING IN THE

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:21.370
HALL AT THE ER. SO THE CREWS RE

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:22.171
GETTING BEAT TO THE GROUND

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.073
RUNNING CALLS. AGAIN WITH NO

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.109
BREAKS. EVER YOU TURN THE

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.211
CRUISER BEING RUN TO RUN RAGGED.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.480
THE BURNOUT RATE HAS INCREASED

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:30.980
PEOPLE ARE MENTALLY AND

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:33.249
PHYSICALLY FATIGUED. ANOTHER

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.017
ASPECT OF THESE UNPRECEDENTED.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.486
LONGTIME THAT CAN'T BE

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.488
OVERLOOKED IS THAT. IS THAT IT

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:40.590
LEADS TO A FIELD CREW HOLD OVER.

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.358
WHICH IS WHEN ARE WE ARE UNABLE

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.527
TO LEAVE ON OUR SCHEDULE AND OF

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:45.428
SHIPS. IN PREPARING FOR THIS

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.597
TESTIMONY TODAY I WAS TELLING MY

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.265
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. ABOUT

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.067
THIS HEARING AND THE TOPIC SHE

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.502
WANTED TO INCLUDE THE POINT.

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.470
THAT GETTING AWFULLY AFFECTS OUR

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.439
FIELD CREWS. HOMES WHAT HOLD

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.174
LIVES YOU END UP MISSING OUT ON

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:00.076
PLANS THAT YOU HAD MISSED SEEING

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:01.711
YOUR CHILDREN. MISSING HAVING

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:07.183
DINNER WITH THEIR FAMILY WHICH.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.184
INCREASE THAN INCREASES THEY

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.585
BURN OUT. I THOUGHT IT I THOUGHT

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.187
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE A

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.322
COUPLE OF. SHORT EXAMPLES A FEW

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.124
WEEKS AGO I HAD A BURN PATIENT.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:18.928
BAD 3240% BURNS COVERING. COVER

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.329
43240% OF THEIR BODY COVERED IN

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:22.131
SECOND DEGREE BURNS. THEY WERE

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.933
IN A LOT OF PAIN AND I HAD

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.402
ALREADY MAXED OUT ON MY PAYMENT

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.170
ALLOWING A LOT BY PROTOCOL. WE

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:28.938
WERE TOLD TO STAND IN THE HALL

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:31.107
UNTIL THEY COULD GET IT GET A

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:32.708
BED FOR MY PATIENT. FORTY FIVE

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:33.376
MINUTES LATER THEY FINALLY FOUND

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:35.011
A PLACE FOR ME TO PLACE THE

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:36.846
PATIENT. THERE ARE TWO MAJOR

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:38.114
PROBLEMS HERE DESPITE THE WALL

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.283
TIME OF FORTY FIVE MINUTES BEING

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.150
SHORT. COMPARED TO OTHERS. FIRST

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:42.818
MY PATIENT WAS IN PAIN AND THERE

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.720
IT. I CAN DO FOR THEM. SECOND

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.455
THE PATIENT HAD EXPOSED BURNS

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:47.990
THAT ARE OPEN TO INFECTION. WE

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.091
STOOD THERE IS MULTIPLE PEOPLE

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:51.160
WALKED BY THE BEAR WITH VARIOUS

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.895
MEDICAL PROBLEMS. THEY COULD

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:55.698
HAVE BEEN. EXPOSING MY PATIENT

FOR EIGHT HOURS WITH A PATIENT I

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:07.210

THE CRUISER IN THE FIELD WITH

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.825
LESS AMBULANCES TO COVER. WHICH

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:25.027
INCREASES OUR- RESPONSE TIME.

SERVICE TO THE POINT OF

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.161
EXHAUSTION. ALL TIMES ARE A

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:41.030
DIRECT THREAT TO PATIENT SAFETY

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.899
AND A SIGNIFICANT DESTABILIZING

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:45.935
FACTOR IN THE EMS SYSTEM.

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.236
MINUTEWOMEN IN YOUR FIRE

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.904

CONTINUE TO ANSWER THE CALL DAN

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.509
THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:55.244
RISK TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:56.846
HOWEVER THESE CHALLENGES ARE

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:58.547
EXASPERATED BY THE LACK OF

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:00.583
HOSPITAL RESOURCES WHEN

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:03.953
TAXPAYERS MUST ON CRITICAL

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.388
EMERGENCY MEDICAL INCIDENTS.

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.423
FROM A FAR BETTER PERSPECTIVE.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.891
THERE TO MEASURE ROLE IN

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:11.727
CRITICAL IMPACTS TO PATIENT CARE

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:12.795
AND PATIENT SAFETY THAT WE

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:15.097
EXPERIENCE. FIRST BARBARA

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.866
PARAMEDICS ARE STUCK ON THE WALL

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:19.435
CELEBRITY DEPARTMENT. NOT ONLY

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:20.870
IS THIS THE LAND EDUCATION FROM

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.805
GETTING CARE AT THE HOSPITAL BUT

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.174
THIS TAKES CRITICAL NINE ONE ONE

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.710
RESOURCES OUT OF THE FIELD.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.278
SECOND PART PART PARAMEDICS ARE

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:31.247
CONSISTENTLY WAITING ON SCENE

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.948
FOR AN AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE WHEN

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.750
ZERO AMBULANCES ARE AVAILABLE IN

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:38.621
THE SYSTEM. AS I NOTED IN MY

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:39.255
OPENING I WORK FOR THE ALAMEDA

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.290
COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WE DO NOT

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:42.391
TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO THE

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.926
HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTY BUT

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.628
PARAMEDICS FROM MY DEPARTMENT

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.863
ARE CONSISTENTLY FIRST ON SCENE.

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:50.166
WHEN PEOPLE CALL NINE ONE ONE

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:51.667
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.702
EARLY ON A CAREER THAT SPANS

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:56.372
OVER TWO DECADES WE REGULARLY

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:59.809
ARRIVED. ON SCENE WITH THE

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:00.743
PRIVATE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.878
SIMULTANEOUSLY. TODAY IT IS NOT

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.947
UNCOMMON FOR OUR PARAMEDICS TO

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:07.283
START RENDERING AID TO A PATIENT

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:08.951
AND THEN WAIT THIRTY MINUTES OR

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:11.921
MORE FOR AN AMBULANCE ARRIVAL TO

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:12.988
TRANSPORT THAT PATIENT TO THE

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.257
HOSPITAL. I PERSONALLY WAITED

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:17.993
LONGER THAN EIGHTY MINUTES. YES

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.862
EIGHTY MINUTES ON SCENE FOR AN

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.897
AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE. ON MULTIPLE

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:24.400
OCCASIONS. THESE WAIT TIMES ARE

01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:26.969
NOT A NEW PHENOMENON IN THE EMS

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.304
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:31.040
FACT. SERVICES BEEN DEALING WITH

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:33.075
THESE TYPES OF DELAYS. FOR FIVE

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:35.411
PLUS YEARS. OUR COMMUNITIES USE

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.246
THAN I WANT SYSTEM WHEN THERE IS

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.081
AN URGENT THREAT TO THEMSELVES

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.483
OR THEIR FAMILIES THEY

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:42.551
RIGHTFULLY EXPECT FAST RELIABLE

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.253
AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FROM

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.821
THEIR EMS PROFESSIONALS

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:47.823
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE'S LIFE

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.492
IS ON THE LINE. IT'S

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:51.093
UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE TELLER

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.229
CITIZEN OF THE LARGEST STATE IN

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.164
OUR NATION THAT THEY MUST WAIT

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:57.199
TO RECEIVE CRITICAL MEDICAL CARE

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.667
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO AMBULANCES

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.669
AVAILABLE TO TAKE THEM OR THEIR

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:02.605
LOVED ONES TO THE HOSPITAL. WE

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.440
URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:06.575
TO EXAMINE ALL THE DEFICIENCIES

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:07.676
IN THE WAY THE AMBULANCE

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.245
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.779
CALIFORNIA AND THE CURRENT

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:13.115
LIMITATIONS ON FIRE DEPARTMENT'S

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:15.451
ABILITY TO OFFER RESOURCES. BUT

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:17.753
FOR TODAY'S FOCUSED WALDHEIM'S

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.555
MCCORMICK IMPACT RESOURCES OUT

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.423
OF SERVICE AT THE E. D.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.560
INTRODUCED ACCEPTABLE DYLAN'S IN

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:27.396
THE FIELD. THESE UNNECESSARY AND

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:28.731
AVOIDABLE DELAYS HAVE REAL

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:31.901
CONSEQUENCES FOR MEMBERS OF OUR

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.202
COMMUNITIES AND I THINK IT IS

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.837
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.171
IMPACT OF THESE DELAYS IN THE

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.674
CONTEXT. OF THE IMPACT ON THE

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:41.443

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.211
NINE ONE ONE DUE TO WORSENING

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:44.413
CHEST PAIN. FIREFIGHTERS ARRIVED

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.382
ON SCENE IN UNDER FIVE MINUTES.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.583
AS A FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.018
BEGAN TO ASSESS AND TREAT THE

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:50.786
PATIENT THEIR SYMPTOMS WORSEN TO

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.589
THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE THE

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:54.490
PATIENT LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. I

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.559
REQUEST WAS MADE FOR A TRANSPORT

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:59.194
IN AN ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:00.563
FOR THE MEDIC UNIT TO ARRIVE ON

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:02.398
THE SCENE THE RESPONSE THE

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:03.499
PATIENT WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AT

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:06.135
LEAST TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.336
MINUTES UNTIL THE END IT'S GOING

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:08.370
TO RISE. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.239
DETERIORATED AND EVENTUALLY WENT

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.941
INTO CARDIAC ARREST. THE

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.409
FIREFIGHTER PROJECTS CONTINUE TO

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:14.910
TREAT A PATIENT WITH ALL THE

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:16.845
ADVANCE CARE THEY CAN PROVIDE.

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:18.013
THEM THAT UNIT FINALLY ARRIVED

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.114
ON THE SCENE NEARLY THIRTY

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.050
MINUTES AFTER THE INITIAL NINE

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:22.918
ONE ONE CALL. FORTUNATELY IN

REVIVED REVIVED BY THE

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:28.223
FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS. BUT NOT

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.392
ALL PATIENTS EXPERIENCE THE SAME

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.661
OUTCOMES. AND FOR SOME. EXTRA

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:35.197
MINUTES COULD MEAN THE

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:36.231
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:37.967
DEATH. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.702
AWARE WHEN DEALING WITH MEDICAL

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:41.070
EMERGENCIES TIME IS OF THE

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:42.471
UTMOST IMPORTANCE. AMBULANCE

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:43.706
PROVIDERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE

AMBULANCES SITTING HOSPITALS

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:55.918

SOMETIMES FOR HOURS IS THE

ANTITHESIS OF THE PATIENT CO OUR

UNNECESSARY STRAIN ON THE REST

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.828
OF THE SYSTEM. OFTEN WAKING

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.998
CRITICAL MOMENTS NEEDED TO SAVE

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:09.898
A PATIENT'S LIFE. ALL THE

CURRENT OPERATE SYSTEM IS BROKEN

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.201
WATER DANGEROUS THERE ARE

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:14.303
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THESE

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.305
CHALLENGES. FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:17.840

INSURERS. THERE CITIZENS RECEIVE

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:39.928
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DEFINITIVE

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:43.065
CRITICAL CARE AND DO SO IN A

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.534

EMPLOYING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:50.906
PATCH THE SYSTEM TOGETHER BUT

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.442
MORE AMBULANCES IN THE SYSTEM

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:54.510
STILL MEANS MORE AMBULANCES ON

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.845
THE WALL. IF THE ROOT PROBLEM IS

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.681

ARE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO COME

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.258
VERY SOON TO ADDRESS CRITICAL

THE HOSPITALS CAN AFFORD TO HIRE

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:28.437
PARAMEDICS ND AT LEAST CREATE A

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:29.938
- SPACED ALTHOUGH THE PATIENTS

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:32.641
FROM ONE PARAMEDIC TO THE NEXT

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.576
WE DID A TRIAL RUN IN SACRAMENTO

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:35.978
WHERE WE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:38.680
PARAMEDICS TO WAIT OUT TO THE

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:39.248
HOSPITAL'S AND TRANSFER THE

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.717
PATIENTS. WHEN WE TRANSPORT WHEN

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:43.418
WE TRANSFERRED ONE PATIENT FROM

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:45.554
OUR AMBULANCE TO THE PARAMEDIC

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.589
WAITING ON SCENE- THAT AMOS WAS

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:50.058
ABLE TO ONE FIVE CALLS WHILE

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.161
THAT ONE PATIENT WAS WAITING

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:54.429
WITH THAT HERMETIC ON AT THE

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:57.266
HOSPITAL THAT TRIAL WORKED I

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.034
KNOW THE STATE IS TRYING TO DO

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.202
IT AGAIN WITH HIM OF PARAMEDICS

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.137
BUT THAT CAN AT LEAST GET OUR

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:03.705
AMBULANCES OFF THE WALL. I'D

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.274
STILL ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.342
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT ARE

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:08.777
NEGATIVE FINANCIAL CENTRAL

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:26.662
AN IMMEDIATE FIX- THE HOSPITAL'S

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:29.097

SECURITY MONITORING PATIENT FOR

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:46.248
THE HOSPITAL WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.584
OUR HOSPITALS LAKE COUNTY HAVE

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:53.455
ACCESS TO TENANTS ADDITIONALLY.

YOU CAN DEFINITELY FIX I AM

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.227
STATE THAT WE NOT QUITE MODE I

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:00.929
DO FIND THAT WE ARE NOT TREATING

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:03.599
THE HOSPITALS AS THEY ARE IN A

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.634
CRISIS MODE AT THE HOSPITALS

HAVE ASKED FOR STAFFING RELIEF-

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.672
AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:14.610
FOR ANY STAFFING RELIEF. FOR I

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:18.146
EAT RATIOS THEY HAVE ARE STILL

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:20.616
EXPECTED TO OPERATE AS A NORMAL

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:22.351
DAILY BASIS BUT ALL THE

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:25.120
REGULATORY PROCESSES. AT THROUGH

THIS CRISIS SO WHAT THEY COULD

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:28.790
GET SOME RELIEF AS LONG AS WE

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.993
ARE IN THIS CRISIS MODE SO THOSE

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.562
ARE SHORT TERM FIXES THAT CAN BE

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.464

EMS PROVIDERS TO DO THAT ON

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.057
MAYBE CONSIDER DOING- LOOKING AT

THOSE PROGRAMS IN UP IN A MORE

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:06.662

THAT ARE LOW QT MEDICAL PROBLEMS

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.140
TO US ALTERNATE DESTINATION ALSO

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:21.343
LIKE UTILIZING A TELEMEDICINE- I

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.178
KNOW WAS WAS TALKED ABOUT A LOT.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:26.214
AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN- KEEP

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:28.083
PATIENTS FROM GOING TO THE

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:29.685

WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO. A LOT

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.127

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:44.633
EMERGENCY- REGULATIONS THAT WERE

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.002
PUT INTO PLACE- I WOULD LOOK AT

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.037
THOSE SYSTEMS. AND CONSIDER

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:51.139
THOSE TO BE ARE ALSO NOT ONLY A

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:54.776
SHORT TERM SOLUTION BUT CONSIDER

WORKING IN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. THE

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.800
ULTIMATE CONCERN THERE IS THAT

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:20.469
WE END UP COMPETING FOR THE

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:22.270
SAME- WORK FORCE- AND THAT

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:24.272
CREATES THE SAME SUPPLY AND

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.941
DEMAND ISSUES THAT I THINK WE'RE

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:28.143
SEEING A HOSPITALS NOW ONE

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:29.478

SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE THAT WE

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.459
HAVE IN HOSPITALEMERGENCY

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:47.262
DEPARTMENTS I THINK. THAT BUT

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:49.598
TEMPORARILY FLEXING- DURING

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:51.066

PARAMEDIC SCHOOL OVER THIRTY

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:02.390
YEARS AGO AND- THE SYSTEM THAT

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:05.193
IS IN PLACE WAS LARGELY. THE

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.062
SAME ONE THAT JOHNNY AND ROY

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.463
WERE WORKING ON FROM EMERGENCY

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.765
BACK IN THE DAY AND- THE PROBLEM

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:13.368
WAS IS THAT WHEN YOU GET CALLED

OUR ARE DOING THEIR JOB THEY

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.610
THEY- THEY ASSIST THE PATIENT

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:22.510
THEY START DOING TREATMENT OF

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.279
THE PATIENT NOW WE'RE WAITING

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:27.215
FOR A MELISSA GET THERE AND- THE

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.251
ONLY OPTIONS WE HAVE CURRENTLY.

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:31.486
ARE WE CAN EITHER TRANSPORT THE

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:35.290
PATIENT TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. OR

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:37.626
WE CAN- HAVE THE PATIENT SIGN

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.160
OUT WHAT'S CALLED A MA WHICH IS

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.929
AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE AND THOSE

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.098
ARE REALLY THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:46.167
THAT WE HAVE- IN OUR IN OUR

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:48.903
REGULAR SYSTEM. NOW IF. IF WE

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.273
CAN USE OUR DISPATCH WE HAVE A

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:52.674
MERCY WILL DISPATCHING WE HAVE

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.609
THAT IS A RESOURCE. WE COULD

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:56.344
POSSIBLY TAKE THOSE PATIENTS

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:59.014
THAT ARE MAYBE DON'T NEED TO GO

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.148
TO THE HOSPITAL OR WE DON'T EVEN

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:02.617
NEED TO RESPOND ENABLES OR A

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:04.452
FIRE DEPARTMENT THERE. WE CAN

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:06.454
USE THE NURSE HOTLINE TO SEND

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:08.323
THEM OVER TO YOU- IF WE DO GET

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:10.592
ON SCENE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.527
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:13.862
ABILITY HOWEVER WE DON'T REALLY

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.664
HAVE THE- ABILITY TO

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.966
REGULATIONS. TO USE TELEMEDICINE

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.302
SO WE CAN HAVE A- FAR APARTMENT

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:21.603
PARAMEDIC OR A NAMELESS

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.338
PARAMEDIC ESSENTIALLY HAVE A

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:26.841
PATIENT TALK TO A POSITION OR A

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:29.811
PA ON A TELEMEDICINE CALL AND

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.813
ACTUALLY GET THAT PATIENTS THE

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.515
CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND SO ON

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.250
AND SO FORTH THE OTHER PART OF

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.052
THAT IS ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS.

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.286
DOES EVERY SINGLE PATIENT NEED

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:40.989
TO GO TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE-

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.891
MEDICAL CARE FACILITY WHICH IS

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:45.160
AN EMERGENCY ROOM NO THEY DON'T.

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.195
ONE OF THESE PATIENTS OFTEN NEED

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.331
LESS CRITICAL CARE THEY CAN GO

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:51.032
TO URGENT CARE- THEY NEED TO

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:55.403
POTENTIALLY GO TO A SOBERING

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.404
SYSTEM. THEY POTENTIALLY HAVE

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.340
BOB MAN- IS THAT THEY TO DEAL WE

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.041
HAVE THE THEM TO. THE PROBLEM IS

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.010
THAT WE ONLY HAVE A ONE SIZE

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.079
FITS ALL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WHICH

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:05.080
IS THEY GO TO. THE EMERGENCY

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.214
ROOM AND THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:08.483
WE REALLY HAVE. SO AND THEN THE

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.552
OTHER- I THINK THE CHIEF BOB

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:12.721
WILLIAMS POINT. IS THAT THESE

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.155
REGULATIONS THAT WERE PUT INTO

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:16.925
PLACE. ARE YOU LOCAL FIRE

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.660
DEPARTMENT THAT WASN'T

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:19.961
TRANSPORTING BEFORE NINETEEN

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:22.664
EIGHTY. DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:25.200
OPTION OF. A LOT OF DEVELOP OF

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.068
DOING AMBULANCES AND ACTUALLY.

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:29.738
ADDING TO THE- THE RESOURCES

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:32.941
THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE NO ABILITY

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:34.776
TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS OR USE A

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.611
BILL AND SALAS. IF WE WERE DOING

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.580
THAT PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY.

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.382
AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:42.050
PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT-

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:44.219
CHIEF ONCE OUR COMMENT. IS THAT

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:45.887
WE HAVE A LOT OF FIRE

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:47.255
DEPARTMENTS ARE WILLING AND ABLE

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:49.057
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. HOWEVER

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:50.658
BUT BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS WERE

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:52.460
NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. SO THE

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.096
POINT IS THAT. WE HAVE A ONE

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.332
SIZE FITS ALL. TYPE OF PMS

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.434
SYSTEM. AND THAT IS YOU EITHER

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.536
GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR YOU

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:05.573
DON'T GO AT ALL. THERE IS

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.241
NOTHING IN BETWEEN. I THINK WHAT

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:07.842
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S A

01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:09.911
LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.346
AVAILABLE OUT THERE. THAT ARE

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.748
SIMPLY NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:16.084
AS FAR AS- WHEN WE NOTIFY THE

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:18.052
HOSPITAL EVERY TIME YOU'RE GOING

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:19.954
TO GO TO A HOSPITAL. N TO

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.589
RECEIVING FACILITY. THE

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:23.158
PARAMEDIC FROM THE EMPTY HOUSE

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:24.592
TO CALL THE HELP THE HOSPITAL

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:25.727
LET THEM KNOW THEY'RE COMING

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.228
WHAT TYPE OF PATIENT OR THEY

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:30.265
HAVE. AN APPROXIMATELY THEIR ETA

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.300
OTHER ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:33.301
BEFORE THEY GET THERE SO EVERY

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:38.072
SINGLE ONE OF THESE PAY. IS NO.

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:39.774
THE HOSPITAL THAT THEY'RE COMING

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:40.942
WHAT TYPE OF PATIENT OF THIS AND

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:43.144
SO ON AND SO FORTH. NOW I

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:43.912
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:46.281
HOSPITALS ARE ARE ARE INUNDATED.

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:47.849
WITH PATIENTS THAT PROBABLY

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.551
SHOULDN'T BE AT THE MERCY ROOM.

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:52.153
HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.321
IN OUR TOOLBOX IN THE FIRE

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:55.056
DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER EMS

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:57.992
AGENCIES TO. TAKE THOSE PATIENTS

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:59.828
TO A MORE APPROPRIATE ARE

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.729
RECEIVING FACILITY AND THAT'S

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.298
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:06.835
RIGHT NOW- QUESTION. THINKING

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:09.103
THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR- QUESTION

AND- SO I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY-

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:20.148
WEIGHING IN- I DID WANT TO

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:21.783
CORRECT ONE PERSON A SAID THIS

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.418
IS BEEN GOING ON FOR FIFTEEN

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:24.752
YEARS- I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IT'S

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.488
BEEN GOING ON FOR PROBABLY JUST

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.723
ABOUT MORE THAN FORTY- THAT'S

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.559
WHEN I ENTERED INTO THIS SYSTEM.

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:33.428
AND SO I DID GET TO WATCH IT

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:35.663
EVOLVE ESSENTIALLY FROM EIGHT

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.999
YEARS PRIOR THE INCEPTION OF THE

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:41.402
PARAMEDIC PROGRAM. AND ONE OF

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:43.438
THE THINGS THAT HE HAS EVOLVED

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:47.175
AND I WANTED TO GET. SOME SOME

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:49.110
COMMENTS FROM SOME OF THE CHIEFS

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:52.146
IS. YOU KNOW THE USE OF THE NINE

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.482
ONE ONE SYSTEM AND HOW THAT HAS

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:57.118
INCREASED BY THE PUBLIC. AND IF

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:59.020
THEY THINK THAT THAT HOUSE.

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.855
BECAUSE THAT'S THE SUPPLY SIDE

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.390
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SUPPLYING

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:04.392
PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITALS. AND

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:07.562
THAT HAS INCREASED. WHAT I'VE

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:08.429
SEEN IS IT'S INCREASED

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:11.299
DRAMATICALLY. AND AND I'M

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:14.869
CURIOUS- IF THAT STATISTIC IS

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:18.606
STILL. INCREASING BECAUSE OF HAS

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.909
BEEN INCREASING FOR FORTY YEARS

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.944
I CAN IMAGINE IF WE STILL HAVE

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.546
THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOSPITALS.

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:26.881
WHICH I KNOW DOWN IN MY REGION

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.616
WE'VE ADDED A COUPLE HOSPITALS-

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.785
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS THAT

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.054
HAVE NOT ADDED HOSPITALS AND

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:34.422
THEY'RE STILL DEALING WITH A-

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:35.557
THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE PATIENT

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:38.359
LOAD TODAY THAT WAS MEANT FOR A

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:41.696
PATIENT LOAD. BACK IN. NINETEEN

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.031
EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. IN

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:45.700
IN THAT THAT ERA SO- FROM SOME

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.669
OF THE CHIEFS AND CHIEF GUY GUY

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:50.338
APPRECIATE. YOUR IT ENLIGHTENING

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.440
US ABOUT THAT WHAT YOU'RE WHAT

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:54.509
BASICALLY IS TALK ABOUT IS

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:57.645
PREHOSPITAL TRIAGE. AND DECIDING

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.981
WHO IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO GO

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.751
TO AN ER- BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:05.620
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.088
BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:08.957
THAT'S ALSO INVOLVED THAT WEIGHS

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:11.626
IN A LOT. THAT- EVERYBODY DOES

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:14.228
NOT NOBODY WANTS THE LEGAL

01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:15.730
RESPONSIBILITY OF TELLING

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:17.532
SOMEBODY WITH A CUT FINGER THAT

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:19.033
HEY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST NEED

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.835
TO PUT A BANDAID ON THAT AND

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.971
KEEP IT KEEP IT DRY WILL THREE

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.205
DAYS LATER THEY HAVE A HEART

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:25.506
ATTACK. AND YOU'RE BEING SUED

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:26.908
MIXING NO YOU'RE BEING SUED

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:28.242
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TRANSPORT AND

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:29.877
FOR THAT CUT FINGER THREE DAYS

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:30.745
PRIOR. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:32.547
EVERYBODY MAKES THAT DECISION ON

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.248
THEIR OWN AND THAT DECISION IS.

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:37.952
OUT I DON'T CARE WHO WE GO ON

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:38.853
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.921
TRANSPORTING. AND THAT HAS LED

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.190
TO AN OVER SATURATION OF YARDS.

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:44.392
AND THAT IN TURN HAS LED TO IN

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.494
IN CASES WHERE I WORK- THE

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.529
CLOSING OF SOME VERY PROMINENT

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:49.430
HOSPITALS DANIEL FREEMAN

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:51.966
MEMORIAL HALL. IS NO LONGER I

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:52.934
THINK IT'S AN APARTMENT BUILDING

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:56.004
NOW AFTER THEY USED IT FOR TV.

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:59.974
DRAMA ON THE ER AND STUFF- BUT-

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.542
AND AS THOSE CLOSE DOWN GUESS

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.044
WHAT IT OVER IMPACTED THE

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.946
HOSPITALS THAT ARE ADJACENT AND

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.848
CENTINELA HOSPITAL. RFK HOSPITAL

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:09.751
CLOSED. SO IT JUST IT THIS

01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:12.353

BETTER WAY OF DOING- THAT PRE

THEY DON'T NEED TO GO TO THE ER

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:02.537
. SO BACK TO MY QUESTION I'M

01:29:02.603 --> 01:29:04.205
SORRY GOT OFF ON A LITTLE RAN.

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:06.107
BACK TO MY QUESTION FOR THE

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.743
CHIEFS- THE CHANGES IN USE BY

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.978
NINE ONE ONE BY THE PUBLIC- WHAT

HAVE YOU SEEN IN YOUR EXPERIENCE

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:14.982
OVER THE YEARS OF YOUR

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:18.553
INVOLVEMENT. THIS IS CHIEF

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:19.554
SAILORS FROM SEGMENT CITY FIRE

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.256

ON NINE ONE SYSTEM IS INCREASING

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:29.464
CONTINUES TO INCREASE OUR CALL

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.299
VOLUME IS CLIMBING STEADILY YEAR

01:29:31.365 --> 01:29:34.068
BY YEAR. BUT TO YOUR POINT ON

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:37.004
THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION. IN

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:37.739
TWENTY SIXTEEN I PUBLISHED

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:40.141
PAPERS RESEARCH PAPER LOOKING

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.976
OUT THIS NOT ONLY COUNTRYWIDE

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.511
BUT WORLDWIDE TO SEE IF ANYBODY

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.079
WAS COMING UP WITH ANY VIABLE

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.948
SOLUTIONS I DON'T SEE THE- FROM

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:49.884
A SYSTEM STANDPOINT OF LOOKING

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:51.853
AT. FROM PATIENT CARE FOR THE

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:54.589
TIME IT DOWN ON A ONE TO LEAVE

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:55.923
THE HOSPITAL THE MOST VIABLE

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.458
SOLUTION WAS SOMETHING CALLED

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.660
HERE INTRIGUED. C. ENTRY ENTRY

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.763
IN TRANSPORT AND THAT IS EXACTLY

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:02.830
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:06.067
THAT TRIAGE THE PATIENTS BEFORE

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:07.769
THEY WENT TO THE HOSPITAL. IT

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:09.637
WAS A QUICK CONVERSATION OVER

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.439
THE PHONE TO EVALUATE THE

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:13.975
PATIENT- THE U. K. IS CURRENTLY

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.144
USING THIS AND THEY WANT TO DO A

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:17.411
TELEMEDICINE SESSION WITH THE

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.780
PATIENT. PRIOR TO ANY ONE GOING

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:21.949
OUT SO THEY CAN GET THAT PERSON

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:24.152
TO THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.019
BECAUSE THEY ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.021
A PROBLEM- BUT THIS WILL GET

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.589
THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:30.224
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE E. R. A

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.993
C. INTRIGUED AS THEY WILL SEND

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:33.461
SOMEBODY OUT TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:34.996
THE PATIENT EVALUATED MAKES

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:36.497
THEIR VITALS ARE STABLE. DO

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:37.698
TELEMEDICINE CONGRESS WITH A

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:39.367
DOCTOR THE EXACT SAME THING GET

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.002
ON TO THE SOLUTION THAT THEY

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:42.904
NEED BECAUSE EVERY PATIENT IS A

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:44.172
PROBLEM. JUST NOT NECESSARILY

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:46.107
THE E. R. AS THE SOLUTION AND

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:48.009
THE TREE TRANSPORT IS WHAT WE DO

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.343
NOW. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:52.380
PROGRAM IN THE U. K. IN TWENTY

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.248
ELEVEN I KNOW DROP THE CALL

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:55.917
GOING BY NINETEEN PERCENT. OF

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:58.152
THE- NOW. A WE CAN'T COPY THAI.

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.987
BUT IT IS A GREAT FRAMEWORK TO

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:02.557
START FROM LOOKING AT A SYSTEM

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:04.258
WIDE PROBLEM OF GETTING PATIENTS

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:06.160
TO THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES.

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.662
THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS THE ER SO

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.964
THE DVR IS RESERVED FOR THE

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.799
CRITICAL PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:14.302
NEED. AND A FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:15.469
REALLY QUICK YOU CRITICAL

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.171
PATIENTS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:18.139
WHEN A CRITICAL PATIENT GETS

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:20.007
INTO AN ER. WHAT HAPPENS WITH

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:22.210
ALL THE STAFF. THERE YOU GO WORK

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:24.645
ON THAT CRITICAL PATIENT. AND

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:27.381
THAT FURTHER REDUCES THE AMOUNT

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:29.350
OF PEOPLE- TRYING TO TREAT THESE

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:30.918
OTHERS TO GET THEM OUT OF THE

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.987
BEDS SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE MORE

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:35.356
PEOPLE COMING IN. SO I THINK THE

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:36.824
ON PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:39.060
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- THAT-

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:41.195
THERE ARE VERY SICK PEOPLE THAT

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:44.398
GO TO THE ER AND- AND WHEN THEY

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:45.967
ARE THERE IN ADDITION TO. WITH

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:49.170
ALL THE RISK- THAT THAT THAT

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:53.608
PERSON WINDS UP- DOMINATING THE-

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:56.978
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE. SO

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:59.347
MANY OTHERS I'M SORRY GO AHEAD

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:01.015
CHIEF. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN THE

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:03.217
SAME AS ON THE PREHOSPITAL SIDE

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:04.252
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE ARE

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:06.153
RESERVED FOR THE MOST CRITICAL

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:06.954
PATIENTS AND IT TAKES A TON OF

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:09.390
RESOURCES- TO KEEP A CRITICAL

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.959
PATIENT ALIVE AND WHEN WE DO ON

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.027
THE HOSPITAL CRITICAL PAGE THEY

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:15.496
DO AN EXCELLENT JOB- THERE ON A

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:16.898
VERY FAST AND THAT'S WHAT

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:18.332
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO DO BUT TO

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:20.101
YOUR POINT IT SLOWS DOWN THE

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:21.702
THROUGHPUT OF ALL THE OTHER LOW

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:23.371
ACUITY PATIENTS. THAT ARE

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:25.172
WAITING IN BEDS OR ON THE WALL

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:26.274
AND THAT JUST HAS A MASSIVE

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.942
IMPACT ON A LOT OF THIS LITTLE

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.510
CUTIE PATIENTS. THEIR PROBLEMS

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:30.945
AREN'T NECESSARILY SOLVED AT THE

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:33.214
ER THEY HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.548
THAT HOUSE TO BE SOLD SOMEWHERE

01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:36.083
ELSE WHETHER IT'S GETTING A

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.885
PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION FILLED OR

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:39.887
WHETHER IT'S A MENTAL HEALTH

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:42.490
PROBLEM IT'S VERY RARELY RESULT

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:44.959
IN THE ER IN THE ER IS RESERVED

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.027
FOR THOSE CRITICAL TRAUMA

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:48.629
STROKES CARDIAC EVENTS YEAH SO

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:50.064
IT'S A GOOD TO HEAR FROM THE

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:52.099
DELIVERY SIDE OF THIS WHAT THEIR

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:53.267
CURRENT RATE- THE TRIBULATIONS

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:54.802
OF DOING THAT TRIALS AND

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.304
TRIBULATIONS OF THAT. WE'RE

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.605
GONNA GET TO HEAR FROM THE

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.740
RECEIVING SIDE OF IT PRETTY SOON

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:02.243

IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT IT'S A

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:10.718
DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT TO WORK

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:14.021
ON. AND WORK IN AND THAT

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:17.124
TRANSLATES INTO IT NOT WRITTEN

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:20.428
IT TRANSLATES INTO A LOT OF EMS

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:21.095
PERSONNEL AND HOSPITAL

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:24.932

YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.369
BECAUSE THERE THEY FEEL LIKE

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.771

MUCH AND- IN THEIR UNDERLYING

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:49.090
ISSUE WENT UNDETECTED- AND THEN

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:51.225
BY THE TIME IT MANIFESTED ITSELF

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:54.128

TRANSLATES INTO A LITTLE BIT OF

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:54.281
BETTER SERVICE FOR BUT THEY

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.417

WHICH- MANY OF US ARE- WE

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:06.327
UNDERSTAND THE WATCHING IT CITY

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:08.262

COME AND BUILD AND WE'VE BEEN

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.069
SUCCESSFUL THAT MY AREA BUT- AT

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.203
THE SAME TIME THAT DOES NOT

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:18.372
ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM THAT THIS.

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.474
OVER SATURATION OF YARS. WITH

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:23.978
WITH THE CHANGING. NEEDS OF THE

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:25.846
PUBLIC. JUST ONE OTHER THING

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:28.415
BONTA SERMON. I CAN PUTT TALK

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.985
REAL QUICK- IN SEVERAL COUNTY-

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:33.888
WE DEVELOPED A PILOT PROGRAM AND

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.489
THIS IS ONE OF OR PARTNER

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:38.592
DISPATCH CENTERS- CAR FIRE IN IN

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:41.195
SEMINOLE COUNTY. AND THEY THEY

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.229
THEY BASICALLY STARTED A PILOT

01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:43.564
PROGRAM WITH THE MERCY

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.065
COMMUNICATION- SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:47.768
AS THE C. N. S. AND THAT'S WHEN-

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.470
WE HAVE A LOW CUTIE CALL THAT

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.705
CAN BE TRANSFERRED- IT DOESN'T

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:52.806
GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AT

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:54.475
THAT POINT ACTUALLY GETS

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:56.343
TRANSFERRED TO A- A NURSE. A

01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:58.145
TRAINED NURSE THAT'S ABLE TO

01:36:58.212 --> 01:37:00.114
TAKE THAT CALL AND PEOPLE THAT

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:02.349
DON PATIENTS NEEDS- DIRECTLY AND

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:04.318
THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS- IT'S

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:07.154
NOT FUNDED. AND IT'S A IT'S A

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:14.962
PILOT. BEING YOU KNOW PRUDENT BY

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:16.230
THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO DO THAT

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:18.399
AND IT IS PART OF THE SYSTEM

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:20.301
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY- THE

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:22.269
PATIENT'S STILL GETTING A GOOD

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.672
OF PATIENT CARE. HOWEVER THEY'RE

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:26.473
NOT BEING PUT INTO THE NINE ONE

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.309
ONE SYSTEM SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:30.945
TO CONSIDER- AS A AS A LONG.

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:33.147
TERM SOLUTION BUT THAT WAS UP

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:34.415
AND RUNNING IN SEMINOLE COUNTY

AS A PILOT PROGRAM AND I KNOW

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:38.919
THEY BASE THAT AROUND A RENO-

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.254
STUDY THAT THEY DID IN THE

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:41.956
PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE SO THAT'S

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.991
JUST A CONSIDERATION. THAT THIS

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:46.026
COMMITTEE MAY- LOOK AT- IN THE

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:47.928
FUTURE AND ALSO HELPING FOR SOME

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:49.263

FUTURE WE MUST REMAIN DILIGENT

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:56.616

SYSTEM AND THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM.

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:12.733
AS WE SEEK TO OF ALL OF THESE

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:14.201
INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS THOSE

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:16.069
SOLUTIONS IF THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:18.171
WORK TOGETHER WILL TIME OUT WE

LEAD TO THE BEST PATIENT CARE

OUTCOMES. AND WE MUST ENSURE

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:24.644
STANDARD. FOR TRANSPORT TO

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:26.313
TRANSFER OF CARE DOESN'T CHANGE.

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:28.248
AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE INCREASED

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:30.417
WALL TIMES OUR GOAL MUST REMAIN

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:32.419
AT TWENTY MINUTES. FOR AMBULANCE

01:46:32.486 --> 01:46:33.987
PATIENT OFFLOAD TIMES THIS IS

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.756
THE STANDARD PRACTICE AND THIS

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:38.225
IS WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:39.893
WORK TOWARD. TOWARD SO I THINK

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.431
AS- AND SUMMARIZING WITH FOUR

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.700
MAJOR BUCKETS FOR SOLUTION. THIS

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:48.769
IS WHAT WE BRING FORWARD. I

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:50.003
THINK THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.172
BY YOU FOR A LITTLE BIT OF POWER

01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:53.740

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:56.309
PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL HHS AND L.

01:46:56.376 --> 01:46:58.578

TO BUILD UPON WORKFORCE

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:08.321
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TO KEEP-

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:09.656
TO KEEP THIS WORKFORCE GROWING

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:11.691
IS KEY. THE SECOND MAJOR

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:14.127
SOLUTION WOULD BE THE DATA I

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:19.566
THINK. WE'VE TAKEN SOME VERY

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:20.233
GREAT STOPS. TO ENHANCE OUR DATA

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:22.169

REFINING OUR DATA OPERATIONS. IS

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:33.413
KEY. COLLABORATION I THINK. TO

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.948
STRESS THE POINT MAINTAINING A

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:36.216
COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:37.884

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:51.531
CONTINUUM. AND THEN FINALLY

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:53.500
WHICH I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:54.534

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:56.670

I WORKED AT MY HOSPITAL AS IT

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:41.908

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:43.443
ALLOW POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:46.479
PARALYZE THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM

01:49:46.546 --> 01:49:47.480

01:49:57.390 --> 01:50:02.128
WHO. THE CARE WAS NOT TRANSITION

01:50:02.195 --> 01:50:03.463
FOR TWENTY FIVE HOURS. I ALSO

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:05.265
VISIT HOSPITALS IN MY ROLE AS

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:06.366
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MEDICAL

DIRECTOR AND HAVE WITNESSED THIS

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.469
FIRST HAND HOW AMBULANCES ARE

01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:11.771
HELD UP WELL CALLS CONTINUE TO

01:50:11.838 --> 01:50:13.807
GO OUT WITH NO AMBULANCE TO SEND

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:15.442
. AMBULANCES ARE A LIMITED

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:17.577
COMMUNITY RESOURCE FOR YEARS

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:19.346
HOSPITALS HAVE TREATED BILLSAS

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:21.281
AS AN UNLIMITED RESOURCE. AND

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:22.849
ALLOW THEM TO WAIT FOR THESE

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.651
HOURS AND OVERTIME IT'S GOTTEN

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.319
OF COURSE PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:28.221
BUT EMS SYSTEM ALWAYS MANAGED TO

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:29.856
BE SUCCESSFUL IN SPITE OF THE

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:31.391
WALL TIME ISSUES BECAUSE THAT'S

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:33.026
WHAT THE FIRE SERVICE AND M. S.

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:34.427
DO. THEY SOLVE PROBLEMS AND THEY

01:50:34.494 --> 01:50:36.930
MANAGED TO HOLD THAT SAFETY NET

01:50:36.997 --> 01:50:38.665
TOGETHER. BUT NOW WITH ANOTHER

01:50:38.732 --> 01:50:40.333
CALL THAT SEARCH LARGE NUMBERS

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.868

IT. AND THE SURGEON EMS CALLS

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:46.573
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IS

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:49.876
UPON US WE FIND OURSELVES AT A

01:50:49.943 --> 01:50:51.544
CRISIS POINT. EVERY DAY EMS

01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:53.213
SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR STATE OR FIND

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:54.881
THEMSELVES COMPLETELY OUT OF

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:56.216
AVAILABLE AMBULANCES TO SEND THE

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:58.718
CALLS. BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING

01:50:58.785 --> 01:50:59.719
COMPLETELY CONSUMED AT THE

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:02.722
HOSPITALS. SO WHAT HAVE WE DONE

01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:03.857
TO MITIGATE. IN RESPONSE TO THE

01:51:03.923 --> 01:51:05.291
CRISIS THE EMS SYSTEM HAS

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:06.960
RESORTED TO A NUMBER OF

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:08.294
MITIGATION MEASURES. WE HAVE

01:51:08.361 --> 01:51:09.763
SPECIALTY UNITS IN TELEMEDICINE

01:51:09.829 --> 01:51:11.364
PROGRAMS LAUNCHING WITH THE HOPE

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:13.366
OF IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING LOW

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:14.734
ACUITY PATIENTS WITHOUT SENDING

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:17.237
THEM TO HOSPITALS. IT IS A BILL

01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:19.005
SINCE THIS WAS JUST MENTION

01:51:19.072 --> 01:51:21.174
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR OUR

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:22.842
DEPARTMENT ALSO APPLIED FOR A

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:25.979
FEDERAL GRANT TO SET UP A NURSE

01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:27.547
TRIAGE LINE IN OUR DISPATCH

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:29.449
THERE WAS A NOTICE OF FUNDING

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:30.483
OPPORTUNITY THAT GOT REVOKED BY

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:32.318
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DESPITE

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:34.621
LOTS OF AGENCIES LIKE OURS-

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:37.490
APPLIED TO GET FUNDING TO DO

01:51:37.557 --> 01:51:38.091
JUST THAT. WE HAVE COMMUNITY

01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:39.859
PARAMEDICINE TEAMS ACROSS THE

01:51:39.926 --> 01:51:43.029
pAPPROPRIATE PATIENTS THE

01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:44.397
PSYCHIATRIC URGENT CARE CENTERS

01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:47.600
AND SOBERING CENTERS IN ORDER TO

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:48.968
SAVE HOSPITAL CAPACITY. IN SPITE

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:50.070
OF ALL THESE MEASURES WERE STILL

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.404
HAVING CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:53.073
WAITING ON SCENE BECAUSE OF A

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:54.908
LACK OF AVAILABLE AMBULANCES. SO

01:51:54.974 --> 01:51:56.142
WE RESORTED TO TRANSPORTING

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:57.710
THOSE PATIENTS BY ANY MEANS

01:51:57.777 --> 01:51:59.312
NECESSARY TO GO OUT TO GET THEM

01:51:59.379 --> 01:52:01.114
TO THE HOSPITAL. WE TRANSPORTING

01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.816
CRITICAL PATIENTS AND FIRE

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:04.851
ENGINES AND PARAMEDICS SQUADS

01:52:04.918 --> 01:52:06.719
LAW ENFORCEMENT PATROL VEHICLES.

01:52:06.786 --> 01:52:08.721
AND EVEN WE'LL CROSS A BUSY

01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:10.824
STREET FROM THE NURSING HOME TO

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:14.027
THE HOSPITAL IN THEIR CAR FROM

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:14.994
THE NURSING HOME. AT THE

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:16.096
HOSPITALS WE CONSOLIDATED

01:52:16.162 --> 01:52:18.098
INSPECTIONS BY GETTING ONE ABLE

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:19.065
TO SCREW TO WATCH MULTIPLE

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:20.467
WAITING PATIENTS. SO THE OTHER

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.368
CREWS CAN GO BACK INTO SERVICE

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:24.270
AND PICK UP THE NEXT PATIENTS.

01:52:24.337 --> 01:52:25.405
AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:27.640
SUSTAIN US IF WE DON'T START

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:28.208
GETTING OUR AMBULANCES BACK

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:30.643
EXPEDITIOUSLY. SO WHAT DO WE

01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:33.046
NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO ACT

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:34.914
QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY TO STOP

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:37.317
THE BLEEDING AND OUR EMS SYSTEM

01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:40.186
. WE'RE IN A DISASTER. IT IT'S

01:52:40.253 --> 01:52:41.988
BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS IT'S

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:43.990
A SLOW ROLLING DISASTER I

01:52:44.057 --> 01:52:46.392
UNDERSTAND BUT IT IS A DISASTER

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:48.228
WE NEED TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY

01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:50.363
IF THERE WAS A PLANE CRASH IT

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:52.098
WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTABLE FOR A

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.433
HOSPITAL TO HOLD UP A BILL SAYS

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.968
AND LEAVE PATIENTS IN THE

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:55.802
FLAMING WRECKAGE WAITING FOR

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:57.837
TRANSPORT JUST BECAUSE THEY FELT

01:52:57.904 --> 01:52:59.572
OVERWHELMED. THE CULVERT

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:01.007
SEARCHES BEEN NO LESS OF A

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:03.076
DISASTER IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF

01:53:03.143 --> 01:53:04.811
A PLANE CRASH EVERY COUPLE OF

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:07.113
DAYS IN MY COUNTY ALONE BUT

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.815
EVERY DAY WE STILL HAVE CRITICAL

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:11.684
PATIENTS WAITING FOR AN

01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:12.886
AMBULANCE AT THE SCENE OF THEIR

01:53:12.952 --> 01:53:14.254
EMERGENCY. IN TERMS OF ALL TIME

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.722
THIS IS ONE AREA IN WHICH

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:17.790
EXISTING LAWS VERY CLEAR. THE

01:53:17.857 --> 01:53:18.958
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:21.528
TREATMENT AND ACTIVE LABOR ACT

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:23.062
AND TALA. HAS CLEARLY DEFINED

01:53:23.129 --> 01:53:23.930
THAT THE TRANSITION POINT IN

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:25.899
PATIENT CARE RESPONSIBILITY

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:28.334
BETWEEN EMS AND HOSPITALS. IT IS

01:53:28.401 --> 01:53:30.103
AS SOON AS THAT PATIENT ARRIVES

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:31.171
AT THE HOSPITAL AND THERE'S

01:53:31.237 --> 01:53:32.906
AWARENESS THAT THERE IS A

01:53:32.972 --> 01:53:34.941
PATIENT SEEKING THEIR SERVICES.

01:53:35.008 --> 01:53:36.910
DESPITE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:53:36.976 --> 01:53:38.378
AMBULANCES IN THIS SORT OF

01:53:38.444 --> 01:53:40.446
PERPETUAL STATE OF TRANSPORT.

WHERE THEY'RE SITTING ON THE

01:53:41.347 --> 01:53:44.517
WALL BUT THE HOSPITAL'S REFUSING

01:53:44.584 --> 01:53:44.951
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:46.653
RESPONSIBILITY. EXISTING LAWS

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:48.054

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:51.157
OBLIGATIONS. AND THEY'D BE

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:52.592
FORCED TO STOP PRETENDING THAT

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:54.160
THEY CAN STALL THESE OBLIGATIONS

01:53:54.227 --> 01:53:57.063

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:43.336
HAPPEN EVERY DAY OF EVERY MONTH.

01:55:43.403 --> 01:55:44.604
OF EVERY YEAR. WILL WAS SO

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.139
SEVERE THAT AND M. C. A. POT

COMMITTEE ISSUED A HUNDRED

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:48.808
TWENTY PAGE DOCUMENT ON HOW TO

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:50.043
FIX IT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN.

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.210
PUBLISHED BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:53.646
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. BUT THE

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:55.882
PROBLEM IS EVEN WORSE TODAY.

01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:58.117
OFTEN OVER HALF OF THE OUR BEDS

01:55:58.184 --> 01:55:58.918
ARE OCCUPIED BY PATIENTS WHO ARE

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:00.586
ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL IN

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:02.555
SHOULD BE UPSTAIRS IN A HOSPITAL

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:03.656
WARD. THIS INCREASES PATIENTS

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:05.692
SUFFERING AND MORTALITY AND

01:56:05.758 --> 01:56:07.327
DECREASES PATIENT SATISFACTION.

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:08.861
THE LIGHTS ARE NEVER OUT THESE

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:10.563
PATIENTS GET NO REST. THE

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:11.964
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS AN EIGHT

01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:13.900
CYLINDER ENGINE RUNNING ON FOUR

01:56:13.966 --> 01:56:15.468
CYLINDERS DUE TO THESE BLOCKED

01:56:15.535 --> 01:56:17.103
BEDS BUT IS STILL EXPECTED TO

01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:19.005
PULL ITS LOAN. EMERGENCY

01:56:19.072 --> 01:56:19.839
DEPARTMENT BEDS DEPEND ON

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:21.708
HOSPITAL THROUGHPUT WHICH IS IN

01:56:21.774 --> 01:56:24.711
CONTROL OF THE HOSPITAL NOT EMS

01:56:24.777 --> 01:56:26.079
FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:27.347
THURMOND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED

01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:29.015
SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TO

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:31.484
AMELIORATE THIS PROBLEM AND THEY

01:56:31.551 --> 01:56:33.319
ARE NOT BEING FOLLOWED IN THE

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:34.487
HOSPITALS. M. AS PATIENT OFFLOAD

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:36.155
DELAYS CREATE A HUMAN TOLL ON

01:56:36.222 --> 01:56:37.990
PATIENTS AND ON EMTS TO WAIT FOR

01:56:38.057 --> 01:56:41.194
OUR STANDING NOT SITTING IN

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:42.729
HALLWAYS WITHOUT REST PERIODS.

PROLONGED STAY THE NAY OF CARE

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:48.868
INCLUDING NO PAIN MEDICATION NO

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:52.138
ANTIBIOTICS NO PRIVACY AND NO

01:56:52.205 --> 01:56:52.772
DIGNITY. ATIONS WAITING IN THE

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:54.440
WAITING ROOM FOR CARE FOR MANY

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:55.975
HOURS THEN LEAVING WITHOUT BEING

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:58.077
SEEN OR TREATED. THIS IS NEITHER

01:56:58.144 --> 01:57:01.114
SAFE NOR DIGNIFIED. ATIONS

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.915
ALASKA'S RESPONSIBILITY AS SOON

01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:04.283
AS THE AMBULANCE ARRIVED AT THE

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:05.651
HOSPITAL THIS HAS BEEN

01:57:05.718 --> 01:57:07.453
DOCUMENTED IN THE TWENTY

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.955
FOURTEEN A PART TOOL KIT. IT

01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:10.323
EVERYDAY I SEE PATIENTS ON

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.491
AMBULANCE STRUCTURES LINING THE

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:13.726
HALLWAYS WITH EMPTY EMERGENCY

01:57:13.793 --> 01:57:14.894
DEPARTMENT BEDS RIGHT NEXT TO

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:16.763
THEM. THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR

01:57:16.829 --> 01:57:18.464
SO LONG THAT HOSPITAL STAFF I

01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:20.333
THINK IT IS NORMAL THAT EMS

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:21.667
PERSONNEL WATCH HOSPITAL

01:57:21.734 --> 01:57:24.237
PATIENTS ON PMS EQUIPMENT IN

01:57:24.303 --> 01:57:25.638
HOSPITAL HALLWAYS. I WOULD

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.206
SUBMIT THAT CLINICAL OBSERVATION

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:28.741
OF A PATIENT'S HEALTH STATUS

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:30.510
REQUIRES MEDICAL JUDGMENT IT'S

01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:32.478
SORT REQUIRES MEDICAL EDUCATION.

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:34.013
AND SO IT IS THE PRACTICE OF

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.149
PARAMEDICINE OF NURSING AND OF

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:37.984
MEDICINE. ANY DOCTOR OR NURSE

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:39.018
WORKING IN A HOSPITAL HAD TO GO

01:57:39.085 --> 01:57:40.720
THROUGH A LENGTHY CREDENTIALING

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:42.288
PROCESS TO ASSURE COMPETENCE.

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:43.556
BUT EMS PERSONNEL ARE NOT

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:45.391
CREDENTIALED TO PRACTICE

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:47.293
MEDICINE ON HOSPITAL GROUNDS.

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:48.694
THE OVER TWENTY YEAR PRACTICE OF

01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:50.463
EMS CONTINUING TO WATCH PATIENTS

01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:52.131
IN THE HOSPITAL VIOLATES THE

01:57:52.198 --> 01:57:53.833
HOSPITAL'S OWN CREDENTIALING

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:56.669
REQUIREMENTS. HOSPITALS ARE IN

01:57:56.736 --> 01:57:58.037
CONTROL OF THEIR INTERNAL

01:57:58.104 --> 01:58:00.339
PROCEDURES AND THEY ARE FAILING.

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:01.941
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ADMITTED

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:03.776
10220% OF PATIENTS THEY SEE

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:06.045
WHICH MEANS THEY SENT 8290% HOME

01:58:06.112 --> 01:58:07.914
AFTER WORK UP WITH TREATMENT AND

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:09.248
FOLLOW UP AS NEEDED. NO IN

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:11.384
PATIENT BED REQUIRED. AS AN

01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:13.052
EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN IF I HAVE

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:15.354
ALL TEST RESULTS I NEED I CAN

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:17.023
EITHER ADMIT OR DISCHARGE 80% OF

01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:18.925
MY PATIENTS ON THE SPOT. ONLY

01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:20.426
FEW NEED CLINICAL OBSERVATION

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:22.094
OVERTIME IN THE E. R. TO FOR

01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:24.430
TREATMENT TO WORK. IT LAB AND

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:25.665
IMAGING TURNAROUND TIMES ARE

01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:27.033
ATROCIOUS BECAUSE HOSPITAL

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:29.635
PROCESSES ARE CONVOLUTED AND

01:58:29.702 --> 01:58:31.204
INEFFICIENT. HOSPITAL'S REPORT

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:32.839
THE AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIMES ON

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:35.141
THESE TEST. BUT THE PATIENT DOES

01:58:35.208 --> 01:58:36.509
NOT WAIT FOR THE AVERAGE JUST TO

01:58:36.576 --> 01:58:38.110
RETURN. THEY WAIT FOR THE LAST

01:58:38.177 --> 01:58:40.646
TEST TO RETURN IF I DID NOT NEED

01:58:40.713 --> 01:58:41.814
THAT LAST TEST I WOULDN'T HAVE

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:43.082
ORDERED IT. HOSPITAL QUALITY

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:45.718
METRICS DO NOT REFLECT THE

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:46.919
PATIENT EXPERIENCE. PATIENT MDMS

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.087
ARE SUFFERING FROM HOSPITALS

01:58:48.154 --> 01:58:50.323
FAILING TO GET THEIR MOST BASIC

01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:50.890
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROCESS

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:54.227
HE'S RIGHT. THEY ALSO SUBMITTED

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:55.495
ALTERNATE DESTINATION IS VERY

01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:56.963
LIMITED IN EFFICACY BECAUSE

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:58.531
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS

01:58:58.598 --> 01:58:59.765
ARE FAR BETTER EQUIPPED TO

01:58:59.832 --> 01:59:01.267
HANDLE A VARIETY OF UNSCHEDULED

01:59:01.334 --> 01:59:02.335
VISITS AND ESCALATE OR

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:04.036
DEESCALATE CARE AT A MOMENT'S

01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:06.305
NOTICE. WE HAVE SPENT FORTY

01:59:06.372 --> 01:59:07.707
YEARS CREATING BOTH THE MEDICAL

01:59:07.773 --> 01:59:08.808
AND NURSING SPECIALTY CALLED

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.676
EMERGENCY MEDICINE WHICH IS THE

01:59:10.743 --> 01:59:12.011
ENVY OF THE WORLD THE

01:59:12.078 --> 01:59:13.679
COMPROMISED EMERGENCY CARE

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:16.382
WITHOUT THE NEED TO TRANSPORT TO

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:17.350
ANOTHER FACILITY. ALTERNATIVES

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:18.584
TO NATIONS SUCH AS CLINICS TO

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:19.986
NOT HAVE A MEDICAL OR NURSING

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:21.821
EXPERTISE TO DO SO AND THEY

01:59:21.888 --> 01:59:23.422
DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT. MANY

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:25.157
ALTERNATE DESTINATION PROJECT TO

01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:26.792
FAILED FOR THIS REASON.

01:59:26.859 --> 01:59:27.860
ALTERNATIVES TO NATION MAY BE

01:59:27.927 --> 01:59:29.395
COULD CARE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:30.396
PATIENT SAY A PSYCHIATRIC

01:59:30.463 --> 01:59:33.799
PATIENT BUT IT WILL NOT SOLVE

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:34.867
THE WIDESPREAD A PUMP PROBLEM.

01:59:34.934 --> 01:59:36.235
NO IT TO THE PATIENTS ARE IN THE

01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:38.037
WAITING ROOM AND DO NOT COMPETE

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:40.439
FOR ER BEDS THEIR CONTRIBUTION

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:43.743
TO ALL TIMES IS LIMITED. SO WHAT

01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:45.778
ARE MY ASKS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:46.979
SAFETY AND DIGNITY FOR THE

ONE ONE AND GETS A DELAYED PMS

01:59:52.685 --> 01:59:54.353
RESPONSE. WE NEED TO THINK

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:55.555
INSIDE THE BOX NOT OUTSIDE THE

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:57.490
BOX. WE NEED IMPROVED HOSPITAL

01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:59.225
PROCESSES FOR BASIC DAILY

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:00.693
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SERVICES

LAB IMAGING STAFFING AND MEDICAL

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:05.164
TREATMENTS SUCH AS HEMODIALYSIS.

02:00:05.231 --> 02:00:07.700
IF I'LL HAVE TO WORK WITH THIS

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:08.734
FOUR CYLINDERS AT LEAST THOSE

02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:10.636
NEED TO RUN SMOOTHLY. M. AS BOTH

02:00:10.703 --> 02:00:11.904
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ARE PAYING

02:00:11.971 --> 02:00:13.806
FINES FOR FAILING TO MEET NINE

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:14.941
ONE ONE RESPONSE TIMES BECAUSE

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.309
OUR EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL ARE

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:18.144
HELD HOSTAGE IN HOSPITALS.

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:19.545
HOSPITALS ALSO NEED FINANCIAL

02:00:19.612 --> 02:00:20.913
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FAILING TO

02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.250
MEET A PART TIME. AND LASTLY MAY

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:26.118
BE MORE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

02:00:26.185 --> 02:00:28.354
CALIFORNIA CAME OUT YEAH COBIT

02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:30.056
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS HAVE.

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:31.757
TAUGHT US THE PARAMEDICS AND

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:33.259
EMTS CAN BE VALUABLE EMPLOYEES

02:00:33.326 --> 02:00:35.428

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENTS.

02:00:40.499 --> 02:00:43.269
THE CURRENT RATIO FOR TO ONE IS

CONDEMNING COLLEGE EDUCATED

THESE NURSES COLLEGE EDUCATED

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:56.315

BETWEEN AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:14.458

UP- OFFICE HE ONCE AGAIN I'M-

02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:03.180
ARE NOT GOING THROUGH MY MIND

02:37:03.247 --> 02:37:04.748
FROM ALL THE PRESENTATIONS WE'VE

02:37:04.815 --> 02:37:05.849
BEEN HAVING FROM THE FIRST

02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:07.584
PRODUCT UP TO NOW THE SECOND

02:37:07.651 --> 02:37:09.686
PANEL. ARE JUST ONE QUICK

02:37:09.753 --> 02:37:11.421
QUESTION FOR PROBABLY ANYBODY ON

02:37:11.488 --> 02:37:13.590
THE SECOND PANEL UNKNOWNS COUPLE

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:16.026
PALACE WE TALKED ABOUT. THE DATA

02:37:16.093 --> 02:37:17.761
THESE COMMITTEES OF THESE BOARDS

02:37:17.828 --> 02:37:18.962
THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:21.265
STUDY THIS ISSUE BUT- TO ME I

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:23.133
THINK THE DATA IT'S QUITE CLEAR

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.102
THAT. THERE IS A PROBLEM I DON'T

02:37:25.169 --> 02:37:27.104
KNOW HOW MANY MORE YEARS OF DATA

02:37:27.171 --> 02:37:29.473
OR HOW MANY MORE COMMITTEES OR

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:33.377
BOARDS THAT NEED TO BE. CREATED

02:37:33.443 --> 02:37:35.179
TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE

02:37:35.245 --> 02:37:36.780
IT'S HERE IT'S BEEN HERE FOR

02:37:36.847 --> 02:37:39.550
DECADES- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:37:39.616 --> 02:37:41.351
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHY WE NEED

02:37:41.418 --> 02:37:43.854
MORE DATA MORE INFORMATION- I

02:37:43.921 --> 02:37:45.789
HAVE LETTERS HERE FROM

02:37:45.856 --> 02:37:46.723
DEPARTMENTS. TELLING ME THAT

02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:47.758
THEY HAVE DATA GOING BACK

02:37:47.825 --> 02:37:49.893
DECADES. BUT YET THERE'S NOBODY

02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:51.628
SEEMS TO FIX THE SOLUTION OR

02:37:51.695 --> 02:37:53.363
WANT TO FIX THE SOLUTION. SO

02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:54.865
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY

02:37:54.932 --> 02:37:56.900
WE'RE HERE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE

02:37:56.967 --> 02:37:58.535
THAT. IF NOBODY WANTS TO MOVE IT

02:37:58.602 --> 02:37:59.336
THESE COMMITTEES THESE THESE

02:37:59.403 --> 02:38:00.804
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HAVE THE

02:38:00.871 --> 02:38:03.040
STATE OF THEM. IT'S GOING TO BE

02:38:03.106 --> 02:38:05.709
OUR TURN AS LONG. TO COME UP

02:38:05.776 --> 02:38:06.243
WITH SOME SOLUTIONS SOME

02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:07.511
LEGISLATION THAT FOLKS MAY NOT

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:10.013
LAW. BUT I GUESS IT'S GOING TO

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:13.917
AFTER FOR. SO THE NO ONE

02:38:13.984 --> 02:38:15.752
CHRISTOPHER ANYWAY ON ON THE

02:38:15.819 --> 02:38:17.287
SECOND WAS. HOW MUCH MORE DATA

02:38:17.354 --> 02:38:18.322
DO WE NEED WE ALREADY KNOW THE

02:38:18.388 --> 02:38:19.823
PROBLEMS HERE. EVERYBODY CAN

02:38:19.890 --> 02:38:22.626
HEAR THAT'S BEEN IN IN THE YEAH

02:38:22.693 --> 02:38:23.827
MASS. FIELD FOR YEARS CONTAR

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:25.863
THIS GOING BACK DECADES THE

02:38:25.929 --> 02:38:27.631
PANDEMIC HAS JUST ELEVATED TO A

02:38:27.698 --> 02:38:31.768
NEW TO A NEW LEVEL BUT WHAT WHAT

02:38:31.835 --> 02:38:34.671
CAN WE DO NOW LIKE I SAID. I

02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:35.272
DON'T WANT TO DO LEGISLATION.

02:38:35.339 --> 02:38:36.306
YOUR TUNING PROCESS I'M GONNA DO

02:38:36.373 --> 02:38:38.642
IS I'M A SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:39.743
THAT I CAN HOPEFULLY SEE WITHIN

02:38:39.810 --> 02:38:41.211
THE FEW WEEKS THAT WOULD START

02:38:41.278 --> 02:38:43.146
TO SEE SOME ELIMINATION OF THE

02:38:43.213 --> 02:38:44.781
PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING I MEAN IT'S

02:38:44.848 --> 02:38:46.884
THERE'S SO MUCH RIGHT. FROM THE

02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:48.886
CALL OF SERVICE FROM THE MY ONE

02:38:48.952 --> 02:38:50.120
CALL TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL HALF

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:51.722
OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY

02:38:51.788 --> 02:38:53.090
MORE DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE

02:38:53.156 --> 02:38:55.692
HOSPITAL WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:38:55.759 --> 02:38:56.326
TELLEMENT MOUNT. TELEMEDICINE

02:38:56.393 --> 02:38:56.927
COMMITTEE PERMISSIVE ALL THOSE

02:38:56.994 --> 02:38:58.495
OTHER THINGS BUT ONCE AGAIN THE

02:38:58.562 --> 02:39:00.163
DATA IS THERE SO CAN ANYBODY

02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:01.965
JUST ANSWER A QUESTION OF HOW

02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:04.668
MUCH MORE DATA AND WHY DO WE

02:39:04.735 --> 02:39:06.570
NEED TO WAIT FOR MORE DATA TO

02:39:06.637 --> 02:39:07.804
COME UP WITH PROBLEMS. AND WENT

02:39:07.871 --> 02:39:10.340
I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR WE CAN

02:39:10.407 --> 02:39:11.808
ALL AGREE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

02:39:11.875 --> 02:39:13.076
THE GENERATOR USES A START

02:39:13.143 --> 02:39:14.344
UNIFIED NAME AS COMMISSIONER

02:39:14.411 --> 02:39:15.879
STARTED JUMPING BY THAT I'M- IN

02:39:15.946 --> 02:39:17.180
THE PANEL I'M- I'M NOT ON

02:39:17.247 --> 02:39:19.049
PALISADE CAN'T RAISE MY HAND. I

02:39:19.116 --> 02:39:20.884
AGREE WITH YOU I THINK WE HAVE

02:39:20.951 --> 02:39:21.919
ENOUGH DATA WE KNOW IT'S AN

02:39:21.985 --> 02:39:23.987
URGENT PROBLEM WE HAD A TOOL KIT

02:39:24.054 --> 02:39:25.088
EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT IS A

02:39:25.155 --> 02:39:26.256
HUNDRED TWENTY VERBOSE PAGES

02:39:26.323 --> 02:39:28.058
THAT DIDN'T FIX ANYTHING I AGREE

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:29.226
WITH THAT. KASICH ADJUSTER THE

02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:31.061
TOOL KITS WILL NOT SOLVE THE

02:39:31.128 --> 02:39:33.330
PROBLEM. WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT

02:39:33.397 --> 02:39:34.298
WE NEED TO THINK INSIDE THE BOX

02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:36.300
NOT OUTSIDE THE BOX LET'S NOT

02:39:36.366 --> 02:39:37.601
GET TOO FANCY WITH SOLUTIONS AND

02:39:37.668 --> 02:39:39.636
IMPROVE THE PROCESS. YOU HAVE.

02:39:39.703 --> 02:39:41.605
AGAIN IF WE CAN MAKE. AN E. R.

02:39:41.672 --> 02:39:43.140
AS EIGHT CYLINDER ENGINE RUNNING

02:39:43.206 --> 02:39:45.108
ON FOUR CYLINDERS BECAUSE- BEDS

02:39:45.175 --> 02:39:46.410
ARE OCCUPIED WITH PATIENTS THAT

02:39:46.476 --> 02:39:47.945
SHOULDN'T BE IN THE YEAR THEY

02:39:48.011 --> 02:39:49.846
SHOULD BE UPSTAIRS. BUT IF I CAN

02:39:49.913 --> 02:39:51.281
TURN THOSE REMAINING BEDS FASTER

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:53.083
IF I CAN GET MY TEST PAID BACK

02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:54.952
FASTER IF I CAN PER IMPROVE THE

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:56.219
EFFICIENCIES WITH. IN THE

02:39:56.286 --> 02:39:57.988
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BLOOD

02:39:58.055 --> 02:40:00.524
DRAWS LABS X. RAYS WITH READS IF

02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:02.392
I CAN DOUBLE THAT SPEED I WILL

02:40:02.459 --> 02:40:04.094
DOUBLE THE SPEED WITH WHICH I

02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:05.829
TURN THOSE. BEDS 80% OF MY

02:40:05.896 --> 02:40:11.802
PATIENTS PLUS 85% ARE NOT BEING

02:40:11.868 --> 02:40:12.436
ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. BEING

02:40:12.502 --> 02:40:14.371
SENT HOME. WE NEED TO FIX THE

02:40:14.438 --> 02:40:15.238
EFFICIENCIES IN THE SYSTEM WE

02:40:15.305 --> 02:40:16.773
CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THEN WE CAN

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:18.275
ALSO THINK ABOUT OTHER SOLUTIONS

02:40:18.342 --> 02:40:20.143
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT BE THE

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:21.278
BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK.

02:40:21.345 --> 02:40:23.246
THANK YOU SIR. CHARLES DICKENS A

02:40:23.313 --> 02:40:25.449
STARK AND MORGAN I THINK I MIGHT

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:26.216
ANSWER THAT A LITTLE BIT

02:40:26.283 --> 02:40:28.185
DIFFERENTLY AND IT GOES BACK TO.

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:29.353
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT OTHER

02:40:29.419 --> 02:40:31.788
FOLKS TESTIFIED TO ITS I THINK

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:34.091
ALL UP. INTO ME WHEN I SAY MORE

02:40:34.157 --> 02:40:36.893
DATA I GUESS IT'S NOT MORE DATA

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.395
TO PROVE THE ISSUE BECAUSE

02:40:38.462 --> 02:40:39.997
CERTAINLY THE ISSUE AS WELL

02:40:40.063 --> 02:40:41.965
PREVENT. I THINK IT'S MORE DATA.

02:40:42.032 --> 02:40:44.134
UNDERSTAND LOCALLY WHAT THE

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:46.003
PROBLEM IS- PERHAPS DOCTOR

02:40:46.069 --> 02:40:48.205
OWNERS. HOSPITAL AND I JUST HAVE

02:40:48.271 --> 02:40:50.340
A PROBLEM WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF

02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:52.809
X. TEST OR Y. X. RAY. THAT MIGHT

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:55.379
NOT BE TRUE ON A IN THE NEXT

02:40:55.445 --> 02:40:56.913
COUNTY OVER IN ON THE NEXT

02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:57.948
COUNTY OVER MAYBE THERE

02:40:58.015 --> 02:41:01.318
ABSOLUTELY. NO AVAILABILITY OF

02:41:01.385 --> 02:41:03.153
BEDS TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS TOO

02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:05.922
SO. I THINK THAT TO ME THAT MORE

02:41:05.989 --> 02:41:09.159
DATA QUESTION REALLY IS. A POP

02:41:09.226 --> 02:41:11.762
MAYBE NOT. MORE DATA BY

02:41:11.828 --> 02:41:15.532
DIFFERENT DATA WHICH IS PARKS

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:17.000
AND THE DATA. FOR A OF THOSE

02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:18.201
LOCAL REGION AND LOOK AREA. WE

02:41:18.268 --> 02:41:20.370
CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE THINGS

02:41:20.437 --> 02:41:21.138
THAT WE ARE DOING ARE GOING TO

02:41:21.204 --> 02:41:24.307
BE HELPFUL YOU KNOW IF SOME. ONE

02:41:24.374 --> 02:41:26.376
HOSPITAL RD HAS LAB TURNAROUND

02:41:26.443 --> 02:41:29.279
TIMES THAT ARE YOU KNOW IN THREE

02:41:29.346 --> 02:41:31.314
MINUTES OR LESS THAN FOCUSING ON

02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:32.883
LAND TURN AROUND TIMES FOR THAT

02:41:32.949 --> 02:41:34.851
HOSPITAL OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT BE

02:41:34.918 --> 02:41:37.020
USEFUL. SO I THINK WHEN I TALK

02:41:37.087 --> 02:41:39.556
ABOUT WE NEED SORT OF BETTER I

02:41:39.623 --> 02:41:41.358
WOULD SAY MAYBE THE ISSUE IS-

02:41:41.425 --> 02:41:43.794
MORE PARSED DATA. SO THAT WERE

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:45.762
MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN COME UP

02:41:45.829 --> 02:41:47.697
WITH SOME BUTTONS- THAT WILL BE

02:41:47.764 --> 02:41:51.902
EFFECTIVE OR AT DIFFERENT AREAS

02:41:51.968 --> 02:41:54.271
. THANK WHEN I MAKE SPEAKING-

02:41:54.337 --> 02:41:56.139
ADJOURNMENT JUST TO ANSWER YOUR

02:41:56.206 --> 02:41:57.974
QUESTION WE DON'T NEED MORE DATA

02:41:58.041 --> 02:41:59.342
WE DO NEED TO FIX THE DATA

02:41:59.409 --> 02:42:01.344
BECAUSE- THAT'S GOING TO HELP US

02:42:01.411 --> 02:42:03.280
UNDERSTAND IF THE- THINGS THAT

02:42:03.346 --> 02:42:04.648
WE'RE DOING ARE IMPACTING THE

02:42:04.714 --> 02:42:06.850
PROBLEM SO I DO THINK THAT WE

02:42:06.917 --> 02:42:09.186
NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON THE

02:42:09.252 --> 02:42:10.387
DATA. BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE. AN

02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:12.222
IMPEDANCE TO ACTUALLY DOING

02:42:12.289 --> 02:42:14.758
SOMETHING TO TRY AND SOLVE THE

02:42:14.825 --> 02:42:15.992
PROBLEMS ARGUING IF OUR WALL

02:42:16.059 --> 02:42:17.527
TIME IN SIXTY FIVE MINUTES.

02:42:17.594 --> 02:42:19.262
MINUTES DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF

02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:19.930
SIXTY FIVE MINUTES IS STILL

02:42:19.996 --> 02:42:22.065
UNACCEPTABLE. BUT WE STILL DO

02:42:22.132 --> 02:42:23.967
WANT TO SOLVE THE DATA PROBLEM.

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:26.002
AND I WOULD JUST SAY AT THIS

02:42:26.069 --> 02:42:27.604
THIS I'M FOR AND AGAIN THIS IS.

02:42:27.671 --> 02:42:29.039
I UNDERSTAND THE HARMFUL SIDE OF

02:42:29.106 --> 02:42:30.807
THINGS BUT THAT THE STANCE HAS

02:42:30.874 --> 02:42:32.642
BEEN KIND OF FOR YEARS. THAT WE

02:42:32.709 --> 02:42:34.077
NEED TO SOLVE THE HOSPITAL

02:42:34.144 --> 02:42:35.846
PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THE M. S.

02:42:35.912 --> 02:42:37.280
PROBLEMS BUT- WE HAVE AN

02:42:37.347 --> 02:42:38.882
IMMEDIATE NEED WE HAVE PAID.

02:42:38.949 --> 02:42:40.350
WITH HEART ATTACKS WITH MAJOR

02:42:40.417 --> 02:42:42.886
TRAUMA WE LITERALLY CANNOT GET

02:42:42.953 --> 02:42:46.389
THEM TO THE HOSPITAL SO. WE NEED

02:42:46.456 --> 02:42:48.325
AN IMMEDIATE SOLUTION TO GET

02:42:48.391 --> 02:42:50.393
THOSE HANDLE. OVERALL WE CAN'T

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:51.995
WAIT TO SOLVE ALL OF THE

02:42:52.062 --> 02:42:53.663
HOSPITAL THROUGHPUT ISSUES WHICH

02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:55.398
I COMPLETELY AGREE DESERVE

02:42:55.465 --> 02:42:58.301
ATTENTION BUT- IT JUST LACKS A

02:42:58.368 --> 02:42:59.769
SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE REALLY

02:42:59.836 --> 02:43:03.874
HAVE TO HAVE BECAUSE. WE ARE

02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:06.009
STILL IN THE MIDST OF A

02:43:06.076 --> 02:43:07.144
DISASTER. SO THERE ARE YOU'RE

02:43:07.210 --> 02:43:09.079
RIGHT IT'S A 100% TRUE I MEAN

02:43:09.146 --> 02:43:10.814
WE'RE WE NEEDED ME TO FIX IS NOW

02:43:10.881 --> 02:43:12.449
NOT LATER- IT'S GOING TO BE A

02:43:12.516 --> 02:43:14.618
LOT WORK ANYBODY ELSE WANTED TO

02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:15.752
FOLLOW UP ON THAT. FROM

02:43:15.819 --> 02:43:16.887
COMMITTEE. I WOULD SAY JERRY

02:43:16.953 --> 02:43:18.855
THIS IS DOCTOR LARRY STOCK- I

02:43:18.922 --> 02:43:20.790
THINK IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR AN

02:43:20.857 --> 02:43:22.092
IMMEDIATE FIX THE CRUX OF THE

02:43:22.159 --> 02:43:23.994
PROBLEM COMES DOWN TO- THE

02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:25.829
COMMITMENT TO OWNERSHIP OF THE

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:28.031
PATIENT'S CARE. UPON ARRIVAL TO

02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:30.100
THE DEPARTMENT I BELIEVE THAT

02:43:30.167 --> 02:43:31.968
MOST DEPARTMENTS HAVE A TRIAGE

02:43:32.035 --> 02:43:33.670
NURSE THE TEXT REPORT. AND THE

02:43:43.647 --> 02:43:45.782
THAT THE WAY FOR WHATEVER REASON

02:43:45.849 --> 02:43:47.284
WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE NO NURSE I

02:43:47.350 --> 02:43:49.486
DOUBT IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO

02:43:49.553 --> 02:43:51.788

02:43:54.357 --> 02:43:56.893
CARE. OR INTO. PHASE AND IF THAT

02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:58.662
ONE HELLO WAS. IMMEDIATELY A LOT

02:43:58.728 --> 02:44:01.298
OF THIS WOULD BE SOLVED

02:44:01.364 --> 02:44:03.967
SECONDARILY THAT'S RIGHT BELIEVE

02:44:04.034 --> 02:44:08.805
. ANYONE ELSE. YOU KNOW JUST TO

02:44:08.872 --> 02:44:10.440

YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK TO MY

02:44:12.475 --> 02:44:13.476
YEARS WORKING AND THE EMPLOYERS

02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:16.246
INDUSTRY ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:17.013
AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THE

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:19.282
HOSPITALS TAKING PATIENTS BY

02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:21.952
YOU'RE RIGHT AND I THINK A LOT

02:44:22.018 --> 02:44:23.153
OF A START WITH THE TRIAGE

02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:25.488
ASPECT OF SOME THESE ALSO. OF

02:44:25.555 --> 02:44:25.989
THE TOP OF MY HEAD SOME

02:44:26.056 --> 02:44:27.857
HOSPITALS DO A REALLY GOOD JOB

02:44:27.924 --> 02:44:29.259
OF TRIAGING PATIENT GET HIM OFF

02:44:29.326 --> 02:44:31.061
THE GURNEY AND OTHERS AREN'T YOU

02:44:31.127 --> 02:44:32.862
HAVE TO SIT THERE AND WAIT. AND

02:44:32.929 --> 02:44:34.731
IT'S THE WAY THEY THEY THEY

02:44:34.798 --> 02:44:35.298
MANAGE THEIR DEPARTMENTS THE

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:37.300
WORK STUFF EVERYTHING I KNOW

02:44:37.367 --> 02:44:38.168
IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF A

02:44:38.235 --> 02:44:39.135
PANDEMIC. BUT I THINK WE CAN

02:44:39.202 --> 02:44:41.104
COME UP TO BETTER. AT QUICKLY

02:44:41.171 --> 02:44:42.872
WAYS TO GET THOSE PATIENTS OFF

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:43.473
BUT- THAT'S PROBABLY BIGGER

02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:44.241
DISCUSSION WITH EVERYBODY ELSE-

02:44:44.307 --> 02:44:46.676
SENT UPON MY COLLEGE HAVE SOME.

02:44:46.743 --> 02:44:48.411
QUESTIONS SOMEONE ABOARD YOUR

02:44:48.478 --> 02:44:50.080

THAT THIS- ECOSYSTEM- YEP WELL

02:44:58.855 --> 02:45:01.791
PRETTY. COVED FORTY YEAR- BUT-

02:45:01.858 --> 02:45:04.894
DURING THIS TIME. HAVE ANY BODY

02:45:04.961 --> 02:45:06.997
FROM A HOSPITAL SYSTEMS- NO

02:45:07.063 --> 02:45:09.065
POSSIBLY EITHER LOOKED AT USING

02:45:09.132 --> 02:45:11.101
SOME OF YOUR- FEDERAL OR STATE

02:45:11.167 --> 02:45:14.471
COVERED RELIEF MONEY- TRIED- YOU

02:45:14.537 --> 02:45:16.473
KNOW. NEW OPERATIONAL CHANGES

02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:18.241
THAT YOU KNOW MIGHT. BE

02:45:18.308 --> 02:45:19.976
SOMETHING THAT THE POINT TWO.

02:45:20.043 --> 02:45:21.478
LESSONS KIND OF LEARN FROM THE

02:45:21.544 --> 02:45:24.314
LAST TWO YEARS- WITH THE

02:45:24.381 --> 02:45:26.016
RESOURCES KIND OF YOU KNOW WITH

02:45:26.082 --> 02:45:27.484
THIS I MEAN A HEIGHTENED EMERGE.

02:45:27.550 --> 02:45:29.185
THAT MIGHT SHED SOME LIGHT ON ON

02:45:29.252 --> 02:45:32.922
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES- YOU

02:45:32.989 --> 02:45:34.090
KNOW AT THAT THAT THAT ENTRY

02:45:34.157 --> 02:45:38.895
POINT. THE NUMBER OF. NOT

02:45:38.962 --> 02:45:42.165
SOMEBODY I COULD CALM ON DR

02:45:42.232 --> 02:45:47.671
MORGAN. DR MORE THOUGHT THAN YES

02:45:47.737 --> 02:45:50.173
SIR- FIRST- YOU KNOW OUR-

02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:53.610
FEDERAL DOLLARS HAD ARE STILL

02:45:53.677 --> 02:45:55.712
FOR OUR US ALONE FORTY TWO

02:45:55.779 --> 02:45:56.946
MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF WHAT WE

02:45:57.013 --> 02:45:58.882
SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF THE

02:45:58.948 --> 02:46:00.383
PATIENTS SO AND THERE WERE NO

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:04.220
EXTRA EXTRA DOLLARS FOR- FOR THE

02:46:04.287 --> 02:46:06.056
CARE OF PATIENTS AND I THINK WE

02:46:06.122 --> 02:46:08.391
HAVE REALLY DONE A LOT OF THINGS

02:46:08.458 --> 02:46:09.259
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO

02:46:09.326 --> 02:46:11.628
I. T. NURSING WE HAVE USED OUR

02:46:11.695 --> 02:46:12.962
TEAM NURSING BUT AGAIN WE'RE

02:46:13.029 --> 02:46:14.798
USING TEAM NURSING TO BE ABLE

02:46:14.864 --> 02:46:18.435
TO. EXPAND CARE BEYOND NORMAL-

02:46:18.501 --> 02:46:21.037
BEYOND THE NORMAL LOCATIONS IN

02:46:21.104 --> 02:46:22.339
AGAIN WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF

02:46:22.405 --> 02:46:24.040
PATIENTS AND TENTS THAT'S NOT

02:46:24.107 --> 02:46:26.009
OUR PREFERENCE TO DO THAT WE'VE

02:46:26.076 --> 02:46:28.411
TAKING OF PATIENTS AND A

02:46:28.478 --> 02:46:30.613
CONFERENCE ROOMS NOT OUR FRIENDS

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:32.582
TO DO SO I MEAN I THINK MANY OF

02:46:32.649 --> 02:46:34.551
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE TO

02:46:34.617 --> 02:46:36.786
EXPAND CARE HAVE REALLY TRULY

02:46:36.853 --> 02:46:39.923
HAVE BEEN. CRISIS MEASURES AND

02:46:39.989 --> 02:46:41.524
WOULD NOT BE THINGS THAT WOULD

02:46:41.591 --> 02:46:45.495
CHOOSE TO DO- PASSED UP PASSED

02:46:45.562 --> 02:46:49.332
THE TIME OF A CRISIS I DO THINK

02:46:49.399 --> 02:46:51.067
THAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT

02:46:51.134 --> 02:46:54.037
PEOPLE HAVE MADE AROUND- ON.

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:55.805
SOME RELAXATION OF THE

02:46:55.872 --> 02:46:57.640
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS

02:46:57.707 --> 02:47:00.176
OF WHO CAN PROVIDE A WHAT LEVEL

02:47:00.243 --> 02:47:02.912
OF CARE SO YOU KNOW THAT ONE OF

02:47:02.979 --> 02:47:04.581
MY EMERGENCY ROOM COLLEAGUES

02:47:04.647 --> 02:47:06.916
JUSTIN HAVING AN APPARENT DO ALL

02:47:06.983 --> 02:47:10.687
OF- THE ENTRY OF MEDICATIONS

02:47:10.754 --> 02:47:12.789
THAT- THAT HAPPENS NOW WHAT

02:47:12.856 --> 02:47:14.290
COULD BE DONE AT A DIFFERENT

02:47:14.357 --> 02:47:16.393
LEVEL SO I DO THINK THERE ARE

02:47:16.459 --> 02:47:17.660
SOME SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT THAT

02:47:17.727 --> 02:47:20.730
COULD- PROVIDED- YOU KNOW FOR A

02:47:20.797 --> 02:47:21.865
QUICK SOLUTION IF WE DID NOT

02:47:21.931 --> 02:47:23.400
HAVE TO WAIT FOR INSURANCE

02:47:23.466 --> 02:47:25.602
AUTHORIZATION IF IN A CRISIS.

02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:27.737
THERE COULD BE A IF THE PATIENTS

02:47:27.804 --> 02:47:29.038
READY TO BE DISCHARGED THEIR

02:47:29.105 --> 02:47:32.008
AUTHORIZED TO BE DISCHARGED I

02:47:32.075 --> 02:47:33.376
WOULD I WOULD A DISCHARGED

02:47:33.443 --> 02:47:37.947
EIGHTEEN PAID. SIXTEEN SO I

02:47:38.014 --> 02:47:38.948
THRE ARE SOME MEDIA SOLUTION

02:47:39.015 --> 02:47:40.884
THAT BE A- ON ALL ENDS OF THE

02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:43.319
SPECTRUM AND- YOU KNOW I'M NOT

02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:45.522
INTERESTED PERSONALLY AND- WHO

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:48.958
pAND WHO'S NOT DOING THIS AND WHO

02:47:49.025 --> 02:47:50.827
IS NOT DOING NOT I THINK THE

02:47:50.894 --> 02:47:52.395
SOLUTIONS ARE ALL REALLY. MULTI

02:47:52.462 --> 02:47:54.531
FACTORIAL AND THERE IS NOT GOING

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:57.634
TO BE ONE SINGLE ANSWER TO. TO

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:59.202
CAST THIS ISSUE EITHER WITHIN

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:03.440
THE TIME OF CRISIS OR- AS WAY

02:48:03.506 --> 02:48:04.541
HOPEFULLY SOME POINT THIS

02:48:04.607 --> 02:48:05.875
HAPPENS THAT WE ARE OUT OF

02:48:05.942 --> 02:48:07.644
POCKET CRISIS BECAUSE WE KNOW.

02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:09.212
WE WILL STILL BE LEFT WITH THE

02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:12.248
ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS AND I

02:48:12.315 --> 02:48:14.384
WILL JUST IN A SHOT OVER THE

02:48:14.451 --> 02:48:15.985
YARD ARM RIGHT NOW THE

02:48:16.052 --> 02:48:17.954
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. HEALTH ISSUES

02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:19.522
THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF

02:48:19.589 --> 02:48:21.391
THE COPA CRISIS WILL BE THE GIFT

02:48:21.458 --> 02:48:24.427
THAT KEEPS ON GIVING FOR THE

02:48:24.494 --> 02:48:26.129
NEXT TWENTY YEARS. THANK THANK

TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARTS

02:48:36.072 --> 02:48:37.974

GETTING SOME RELIEF THAT RELIEF

02:48:51.521 --> 02:48:53.823
IS COMING OVER TIME AND IT'S NOT

02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:56.726
ENOUGH TO COVER THE LOSSES THAT

02:48:56.793 --> 02:48:58.862
THEY TOOK- I WOULD ALSO STRESS.

02:48:58.928 --> 02:49:00.163
AGAIN DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:03.600
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED- IN TWO

02:49:03.666 --> 02:49:04.868
THOUSAND FOURTEEN ANSWER AND SAY

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.903
TO WORK ON THAT TOOL KIT AS

02:49:06.970 --> 02:49:08.137
EIGHTY OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY

02:49:08.204 --> 02:49:09.706
START EXPLORING THIS

02:49:09.772 --> 02:49:12.342
MULTIFACTORIAL PROBLEMS. AND HOW

02:49:12.408 --> 02:49:14.110
WE NEED TO SOLVE IT REGIONALLY

02:49:14.177 --> 02:49:16.212
OUR STATE AS WIDE COMPLEX AND

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:18.147
VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE MONTH SO

02:49:18.214 --> 02:49:20.016
AND COUNTY TO THE OTHER. AND I

02:49:20.083 --> 02:49:22.185

02:49:23.086 --> 02:49:26.089
PROBLEMS AND HOSPITALS NEED HELP

ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION-

02:49:28.658 --> 02:49:30.093
THAT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TOOL

02:49:30.159 --> 02:49:31.861
KIT WAS TO HAVE HOSPITALS DO AS

02:49:31.928 --> 02:49:34.063
MUCH AS THEY COULD IN THE INSIDE

02:49:34.130 --> 02:49:36.499
OF THE HOSPITAL RELATIVE TO EACH

02:49:36.566 --> 02:49:39.068
TREE R. AS- A TECHNOLOGY

02:49:39.135 --> 02:49:40.537
ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO CHANGE.

02:49:40.603 --> 02:49:43.306
THE TIME BUT OF COURSE SINCE TWO

02:49:43.373 --> 02:49:44.207
THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE VOLUMES

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:46.175
HAVE EXACERBATED AND WE HAVE ALL

02:49:46.242 --> 02:49:47.210
KINDS OF COMMUNITY ISSUES THAT

AREN'T BEING ADDRESSED

02:49:48.411 --> 02:49:49.379
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS

02:49:49.445 --> 02:49:51.714
HOMELESSNESS SO. I WOULD SAY WE

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:53.383
NEED TO START RIGHT AWAY WITH

02:49:53.449 --> 02:49:55.285
REGIONAL ANSWER COLLECTIVES JUST

02:49:55.351 --> 02:49:57.754
LIKE WE HAD IN TWO THOUSAND

02:49:57.820 --> 02:49:58.354
FOURTEEN WHERE WE CAN ADDRESS

02:49:58.421 --> 02:50:00.390
THE LOCAL REGIONAL ISSUES WHERE

02:50:00.456 --> 02:50:01.991
WE CAN DEVELOP DATA THE MEASURE

02:50:02.058 --> 02:50:03.826
CHANGE. DEVELOP ALL THOSE

02:50:03.893 --> 02:50:05.528
COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE ALTERNATE

02:50:05.595 --> 02:50:07.931
DESTINATION A TRIAGE ALL OF

02:50:07.997 --> 02:50:10.333
THOSE INNOVATIONS THAT ARE

02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:12.702
HAPPENING MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:17.240
REGULATORY. AND THAT'S A THAT

02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:19.776
WOULD BE A WAY TO GET. MEDIA

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:21.778
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT- WASHER

02:50:21.844 --> 02:50:23.446
SORORITY QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW

THAT I HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS I

02:50:25.114 --> 02:50:26.416
THINK EVERYBODY HAS COVERED JUST

02:50:26.482 --> 02:50:28.418
ABOUT EVERY QUESTION- QUITE

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:32.088
WELL- YOU KNOW A- I THINK DR

02:50:35.692 --> 02:50:37.660
ISSUE IS REALLY REALLY COMPLEX.

02:50:37.727 --> 02:50:38.962
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY

02:50:39.028 --> 02:50:41.331
DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT THAT NEED

02:50:41.397 --> 02:50:44.667
TO BE LOOKED AT AND CHANGE BUT

02:50:44.734 --> 02:50:46.536
AT THE SAME TIME CHANGING IT IN

02:50:46.603 --> 02:50:49.005
A MANNER THAT DOESN'T. RISK

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:52.442
PATIENT CARE OR OR A COMPROMISE

02:50:52.508 --> 02:50:53.643
PATIENT CARE AT THE END OF THE

02:50:53.710 --> 02:50:57.113
DAY- YOU KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM

02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:00.316
OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED-

02:51:00.383 --> 02:51:01.351
YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A

02:51:01.417 --> 02:51:03.086

POLICE GIVEN TO THE PARAMEDICS

02:54:19.515 --> 02:54:21.284

02:54:35.131 --> 02:54:36.899
MORE PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY DO

NEED HELP. SO YOU KNOW LIKE I

02:54:39.902 --> 02:54:41.838
SAID THIS IS EVOLVED OVER THE

02:54:41.904 --> 02:54:43.973
YEARS AND YEARS. IT WASN'T

02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:46.008
NEARLY AS BAD AS IT IS NOW IN

02:54:46.075 --> 02:54:48.344
WHEN YOU KNOW FORTY YEARS AGO

02:54:48.411 --> 02:54:49.545
BUT YOU COULD SEE IT WAS

02:54:49.612 --> 02:54:52.682
STARTING. IT WAS STARTING. AND

02:54:52.748 --> 02:54:54.217
AND HERE WE ARE TODAY AND WHEN

02:54:54.283 --> 02:54:56.018

02:54:56.085 --> 02:54:59.989
REALLY. REALLY ILLUMINATES- THE

02:55:00.056 --> 02:55:02.491
CRISIS AND- AND THAT'S WHAT WE

02:55:02.558 --> 02:55:04.093
HAVE SO WE NEED SHORT TERM

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:05.261
SOLUTIONS BUT WE ALSO NEED LONG

02:55:05.328 --> 02:55:08.331
TERM SOLUTIONS. AND WE NEED TO

02:55:08.397 --> 02:55:10.066
LOOK AT REGULATIONS WE NEED TO.

02:55:10.132 --> 02:55:11.934
LOOK AT WAYS OF STREAMLINING

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:14.837
THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE- SO THAT

02:55:14.904 --> 02:55:16.606
TO YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE THE

02:55:16.672 --> 02:55:18.140
EIGHTEEN PEOPLE THAT THE DOCTOR

02:55:18.207 --> 02:55:19.175
WAS TALKING ABOUT COULD BE

02:55:19.242 --> 02:55:20.843
DISCHARGED. WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS

02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:22.411
THEY'RE READY TO GO HOME THERE

02:55:22.478 --> 02:55:24.547
THEY KICK ME OUT OF THERE AND

02:55:24.614 --> 02:55:26.816
THAT BEDS FREE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE

02:55:26.883 --> 02:55:29.018
AND YET NO IT TAKES ANOTHER.

02:55:29.085 --> 02:55:31.320
THREE OR FOUR HOURS FOR THEM TO

02:55:31.387 --> 02:55:34.390
ACTUALLY GET TO GO HOME- SO I

02:55:34.457 --> 02:55:37.593
FEEL I FEEL FOR OUR- EMS WORKERS

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.695

INVOLVED IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING

02:55:42.431 --> 02:55:43.933
THE PRE HOSPITAL SETTING.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.002
BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM THAT ISN'T

02:55:46.068 --> 02:55:48.304
WORKING IN CALIFORNIA- WITH THE

02:55:48.371 --> 02:55:49.705
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE

02:55:49.772 --> 02:55:51.841
TO US THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

02:55:51.908 --> 02:55:53.376
IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:55.544
PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. SO I THINK

02:55:55.611 --> 02:55:57.980

REASONABLE THINGS TO DO IN THE

02:56:04.921 --> 02:56:06.555
SHORT TERM AND THEN ALSO

02:56:06.622 --> 02:56:08.491
CONTINUE TO WORK GOING FORWARD.

02:56:08.557 --> 02:56:10.459

LONGER TO GET IMPLEMENTED-

02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:15.097
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S JUST

02:56:15.164 --> 02:56:16.499
