THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS THE LARGEST CBD MARKET IN UNITED STATES DESPITE PASSAGE OF AB FORTY FIVE LAST YEAR THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS LEGAL AND WHO CAN PRODUCE CBD PRODUCTS IN THIS NOON MARKET PLACE. A REST A RECENTLY ISSUED DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FAQ HAS FURTHER MUDDIED THE WATERS BY INCORRECTLY STATING THAT OUT OF STATE MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REGISTER IN CALIFORNIA. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX REPRESENT A REFINEMENT OF LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION AB FORTY FIVE TO FURTHER OUTLINE IT DEFINED AND STABLE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENT FOR LICENSE CBD PRODUCTS IN THE STATE. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX ALSO STATES LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO EVENTUALLY ENHANCE THE VIABILITY OF CANNABIS LICENSEES IN THE MARKETPLACE BY PURSUING MEASURES TO RELIEVE TAX AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND TO AUTHORIZE LICENCES TO MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTE AND SELL HAVE BEEN KIND OF ANNOYED. PRODUCTS IN COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT LAW.

HI MY NAME IS GREG HARTMAN- ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ELEVATOR CONSTRUCTORS- WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. I WISH. YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS POINT. OKAY THERE ARE NO MORE COMMENTS AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING IT BACK ALL THESE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALEXANDER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THE BILL. SEEING NONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU SIR AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE CAP ONLINE UNLICENSED WORK. HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. INFLATION IS INCREASED BY 74% SINCE THAT TIME ATTEMPTING TO OPERATE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. ON NINETEEN NINETY BUYING POWER. IT IS THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION TO ALLOW FOR SUCH OVER THE THRESHOLD THAT THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED STATED POLICY. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THIS BILL HAS BEEN TRIED A NUMBER OF TIMES IN DIFFERENT WAYS SOME ASKING TO DOUBLE THE THRESHOLD OTHER SHOT TO TIE IT TO THE CPI. REGARDLESS OF THE METHOD TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE DIX DISCLOSURE FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND FROM GROUPS OPPOSING THIS BILL HAS BEEN THE SAME. EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS ISSUE EXIST. TECHNOLOGY THAT IT WILL AFFECT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. AND THEN THEY REFUSED TO ACT- TO SOMEONE Væ INVENTED CONCERNED THAT ADDRESSES THAT WILL INCREASE FRAUD. BUT THE- BUT THAT WE HAVE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR INPUT ON THIS ISSUE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO AMEND THIS BILL IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS ALL PARTIES INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WHO PERFORM THIS TYPE OF WORK. INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN SACRAMENTO. SO I ASK AGAIN. THAT IF WE HAVE A THRESHOLD FOR UNLICENSED CONTRACTING WORK HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AS A RETIRED CONTRACTOR IT'S NOT THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR THE REMODEL THE LUMBER ALONE IS GOING TO COST MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE DRYWALL ALONE IS GOING TO COST MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT IS NOT THE FRAUD THAT WE'RE AFTER I'M TRYING TO BE THE VOICE FOR THE LITTLE MAN. AT THAT TIME A RETREAT REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH. WHAT WHILE I UNDERSTAND IN AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. YOUR INTENT I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULDPUT HOMEOWNERS AT GREATER FINANCIAL RISK BY ALLOWING UNLICENSED INDIVIDUALS. TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTION WORK AND OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WHEN LABOR COSTS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR LESS. BUT THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE COST OF MATERIALS. THE BILL ALSO RECEIVED LATE OPPOSITION LAST WEEK WHICH RAISE A NUMBER OF POLICY CONCERNS THAT WARRANT ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. CONSEQUENTLY I AM UNABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY- MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN NO BERMAN NO FLORA. FLOOR HI BLOOM. BLOOM NO BONTA. CAN CAN I CUNNINGHAM FONG. FONG I GIPSON. GIPSON GRAYSON GRAYSON NOW IRWIN LEAN. LINO MCCARTY MEDINA SALAS SMITH. SMITH I THINK WARD FOR NOW WEBER WEBER NOW. OTHER VOTERS FORTY SEVEN WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS- THANK YOU SUMMER SMITH I LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING YOUR BILL ON CONSENT LATER TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. SO WITH THAT I SEE DOCTOR ARAMBULA. READY TO ROCK AND ROLL I DON'T NUMBER ELEVEN AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE. REMEMBER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS READY WHEN YOU ARE THINK IT ARAMBULA I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE SUGGESTED AMOUNT IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS FURTHER I AGREED TO THESE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE OF. ANALYSIS AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE WILL HELP CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SAFEGUARD OPIOID MEDICATIONS AND REDUCE THE ACT OF PILFERING. A POWERFUL ON RAMP TO THE NATION'S OPIOID ADDICTION CRISIS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A PHARMACIST TO PROVIDE A SCHEDULED OR TWO AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN A LOCKABLE CONTAINER. PRESCRIPTIONS SUCH AS MORPHINE OXYCODONE AND RITALIN. BILL FOR IN THE ACT OF SNEAKING A SMALL NUMBER OF PILLS HOPING THAT IT WILL GO UNDETECTED IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF OUR YOUTH OPIOID ABUSE HERE IN AMERICA. THE OUTDATED CHILD RESISTANCE PRESCRIPTION VIALS CURRENTLY IN USE HAVE NOT BEEN MODIFIED IN OVER FIFTY YEARS. WHEN THE FEDERAL POISON PREVENTION PACKAGING ACT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. THE GOAL BACK THEN WAS FOR US TO PREVENT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE FROM GAINING ACCESS TO ASPIRIN. TODAY THOSE SAME CHILD LOCKS ARE USED TO PROTECT MEDICATIONS WHICH ARE RANGING. FROM COUGH MEDICINES TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT MEDICATIONS THAT ARE EIGHTY TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE. REQUIRING LOCKING PRESCRIPTION VIALS FOR POWERFUL NARCOTICS IS A LOW COST WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE THE ANTIQUATED FEDERAL LAWS THAT ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING THIS NATIONWIDE EPIDEMIC IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO SIX FIVE IT WILL BE PATTY VARGAS WHO IS REPRESENTING THE RECOVERY ADVOCACY PROJECT. AND SHERRY DALY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA GOOD AUDIBLE CHAIR MEMBER SHERRY DALY WITH CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND ADDICTION COUNSELORS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TREATMENT PROGRAMS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WOULD REST AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RECOVERY THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'M HERE TODAY TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE BOTH AS AN EXPERT IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FIELD AND PERSONALLY AS A PARENT. FROM A CLINICAL STANDPOINT WALKING AN IN VERY EFFECTIVE PREVENTION MEASURE CONCERNING YOUNG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS THIS AGE GROUP IS MATURE ENOUGH TO CALCULATE RISK REWARD POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ACTIONS STEALING TWO OR THREE PILLS FROM A CONTAINER PERIOD OF TIME IS FAR LESS LIKELY TO BE DETECTED THAN AN ENTIRE CONTAINER OF MEDITATE MEDICATION SUDDENLY GOING MISSING THEREFORE EXPERIMENTING WITH HER PHARMACEUTICALS FROM HOME MEDICINE CABINET HAS VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE FROM A PARENTAL PUNISHMENT PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM A LIFE AND DEATH STANDPOINT CONSEQUENCES FROM THIS BEHAVIOR CAN LITERALLY BE DEADLY. INCLUDED IN OUR LETTER OF SUPPORT WITH A NEWS REPORT ABOUT A FAMILY IN INDIANA WHO EXPERIENCED THE TRAGEDY THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN THESE POWERFUL MEDICATIONS ARE SHARED CASUALLY AT PARTIES AND MIXED WITH ALCOHOL. HE SAVAGE HAD TO. SONS NICK JACK WHO LOVE TALKY PACHELBEL AND LATE NIGHT HANGOUTS WHEN IT CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE TO CELEBRATE YOUNGER BROTHER JACK'S HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION THE TO.ATTEND A SMALL PARTY WITH FRIENDS WERE OPIOIDS AND ALCOHOL WERE SHARED. IN THE MORNING BECKY WENT TO PICK UP LAUNDRY IN JACK'S ROOM. AS WE ALL DO WHEN THEY COME HOME FROM COLLEGE. SHE FOUND HIM UNRESPONSIVE. UNBELIEVABLY WHILE SHE WAS ADMINISTERING CPR PARAMEDICS ARRIVED BUT WENT TOWARD THE BASEMENT WHERE ANOTHER CALL FOR ASSISTANCE HAD BEEN RECEIVED. THAT NIGHT BECKY LOST TWO OF HER FOUR SONS TO OPIOID OVERDOSE OVERDOSE. FOR PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE I'VE EXPERIENCED PILFERING AND MY OWN HOME. ALTHOUGH I WAS SPARED THE HORRIFIC TRAGEDY MISS SAVAGE SYLLABUS WITH TODAY. AS AN ADVOCATE A FIELD OF ADDICTION TREATMENT FOR THREE DECADES I BELIEVE MY CHILDREN HAD SOMEHOW BECOME IMMUNE TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AFTER ALL I DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS I HAD THE TALKS I GAVE ALL THE PERTINENT INFORMATION AND I EXCLUDED THEM FROM ENVIRONMENTS WHERE I SUSPECTED DRUG AND ALCOHOL. WOULD BE A- THEY WERE STRAIGHT EAST MUSICIAN DANCERS. NONE OF MY- WERE VERY AFFECTED BY THE DISS. OF A THAT. WHEN MY COLLEGE AGE HOW RETURNED UNIVERSITY IN EUROPE. WITH A SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER DIAGNOSIS WAS SADDENED AND CONFUSED HOW THE STARTED. WHO HAD INFLUENCE MY CHILD. WHY WOULDN'T CHILD EVER START USING DRUGS ASKED. IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTY MONTHS INTRO MY CHILD BECAUSE- THAT I ASKED SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. ONE MIGHT TRIAL TOLD ME THAT HER USE BEGAN IN MY HOME. BILL LEFTOVER NORCO FROM A SURGERY I WAS SHOCKED IN IN THIS. MY HEART SANK I THOUGHT IF I ONLY KNEW. HOW MUCH PAYMENTS UP COULD I HAVE SAVED MY CHILD LIFE. AND MY OWN FAMILIES. HOW MUCH TIME DO WE LOSE AND HOW MUCH MONEY WAS LOST PAYING FOR MONTHS OF RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. ALL BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. IN OUR HOME. IT'S TOO LATE FOR BECKY AND- OF PARENTS WHO. DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW. WE CAN CHANGE THAT WITH AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE I RESPECTFULLY URGE DRIVE UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM PATTY VARGAS I'M A STATE ORGANIZER WITH THE RECOVERY. PROJECT AND ALSO APPEAR PARENT COACH WITH THE PARTNERSHIP IN DETECTION. I'M ALSO A MOTHER HER SON TO OPIOID ADDICTION. AND I HAVE A DAUGHTER IN RECOVERY NOW. TO BE HONEST I SELDOM WORRIED ABOUT MY KIDS PILFERING FROM MY MEDICINE CABINET MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THERE. BACK THEN I HAD AN AVERSION TO NARCOTICS AND I NEVER TOOK ANYTHING STRONGER THAN ASPIRIN OR IBUPROFEN. SO IF MY KIDS WANTED TO EXPERIMENT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO ELSEWHERE AND THEY DID. WHEN MY SON WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN I LEARNED THAT HE AND SEVERAL OF HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN STEALING PILLS FROM THEIR PARENTS A LITTLE HERE. A LITTLE THERE TRADING AND SELLING BACK AND FORTH. JOEL'S CONTRIBUTION WAS HIS OWN ATTAR ALL I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS A HOT TICKET ON THE ILLICIT MARKET. I DID CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF MY KIDS FROM THE AGE OF TEN AND UP ABOUT THE DANGERS OF ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA I WAS A KID FROM THE SIXTIES. I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED TALKING ABOUT PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS WHY DID THEY USE THESE DRUGS. BECAUSE IT WAS SO EASY TO GET PLAIN AND SIMPLE. GREG EXPERIMENTATION DOESN'T START WITH A NEEDLE IN THE VEIN IT STARTS WITH DRUGS THAT ARE IS EASY TO GET AS OPENING YOUR MOM'S MEDICINE CABINET. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT UP 280% OF HEROIN ADDICTS BEGAN BY USING PRESCRIPTION. OPIOIDS WHAT IF THERE WAS A SAFEGUARD IN PLACE THAT MADE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO ACCESS WHAT IF THAT YOUNG PERSON HAD TO DO A REALLY QUICK RISK REWARD ASSESSMENT. SNEAKING A PILLAR TO HEAR IN THERE VERSUS TAKING THE WHOLE BOTTLE. LOCKING PILL VIALS ARE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PREVENTING. OPIOID ADDICTION MAKING THAT SNAP DECISION A WHOLE LOT EASIER. TWO OF MY KIDS EVENTUALLY GRADUATED OTHER DRUGS INCLUDING HEROIN IN MATH AND WE LOST JOEL IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. HE WAS A POET HE WAS A MUSICIAN HE WAS FUNNY AND HE- HE WAS LOCKED OUT. HE WAS ALSO BROKEN BY AN UNFORGIVING SYSTEM AND THE DISEASE HE JUST COULDN'T BEAT. I WISH I HADN'T BEEN SO COMPLACENT ASSUMING THAT MY IN LIGHT AND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA ACCURATELY REPRESENTED WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON IN THEIR SCHOOL. IF I HAD I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY SAVE THE MANY YEARS THAT THEY LOST TO ADDICTION ULTIMATELY COSTING MY SON HIS LIFE. IT COULD HAVE SAVED OUR FAMILY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN TREATMENT LEGAL FEES AND OTHER RESIDUAL COST NOT TO MENTION THE TRAUMA OF CHILD LOST AN OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT. AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT SCHEDULE TWO DRUGS ARE ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY THOSE WHO NEED THEM AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS VARIOUS IMAGE DALY- WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO A PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I BELIEVE WE HAVE- MISSOULA HORN. THE CALVET RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. NEAR ME HEY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS WHEN THE GOAL HORN AND I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHAIN DRUG STORES AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE M. FIRST IS WHEN I RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE M. WE SHARE THAT COMMITMENT TO COMBAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND THEFT- UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T THINK AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE IS THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION AS DRAFTED- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WE HAVE THREE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY. FIRST AND WHAT MOST NOTABLY AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE FIVE RAISES SOME SERIOUS SAFETY QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR MEDICATIONS SOME PATIENTS MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY OPENING A LOCKABLE VIAL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- OR THEY MIGHT FORGET THEIR PASSCODE AND BE UNABLE TO RETRIEVE IT WHEN THEY NEED IT LEAVING THEM WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE MEDICATION. SECOND THIS BILL WILL PUT SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON PHARMACIES- M. ALTHOUGH IT DOES REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO REIMBURSE PHARMACIES FOR THE COSTS OF THE LOCK WILL BILES PHARMACIES WILL STILL HAVE TO FRONT LOAD THE COSTS AND FOLLOW UP WITH MANUFACTURERS TO RAISE RECEIVE PAYMENT. PHARMACIES ACTUALLY INTERACT WITH MANUFACTURERS DIRECTLY TYPICALLY GO THROUGH WHOLESALERS SO TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROCESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SET UP AN ENTIRE NEW ACCOUNTING SYSTEM JUST TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE LOCKABLE VIALS M. IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM AND CONSTANTLY FOLLOWING UP WITH MANUFACTURERS WILL PLACE A NEW FINANCIAL BURDEN ON PHARMACIES AND DISTRACT FROM PATIENT CARE AND I THINK AS WE HONOR PHARMACIES ARE INCREDIBLY BUSY PLACES- M. DISPENSING MEDICATIONS AM DOING HIS ASIANS AND TESTING THIS IS ONE MORE THING THAT WILL- PUT A KINK IN THE WORK FLOW. MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT PATIENTS ACTUALLY ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO LOCKABLE VIALS I AM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AB TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH REQUIRES CHAIN PHARMACIES TO PROMINENTLY DISPLAY AND OFFERED TO PATIENTS LOCKABLE STORAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDING LOCKABLE PRESCRIPTION VIALS M. THE PATIENTS IF THEY WANT TO USE THEM THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT. THE SLIDE HAS ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A BELIEVE THREE YEARS SO WE THINK IT IS PREMATURE TO IMPLEMENT A MANDATE WITHOUT FIRST SEEING IF THE SLOT IS WORKING AND. SEEING IF IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY CAN ADDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG- TELL FRANK. FOR AN ABUSE. M. DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED THE COMMITTEE AND- WHICH- THEIR- THAT PHARMACIES MAINTAIN PATIENT PASSCODES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THESE DO NOT REMOVE THE BURDEN ON PHARMACIES. AM I THINK WE COULD GET TO A PLACE THAT WE COULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. IF THE LOCKABLE VIALS ARE MADE VOLUNTARY AND IF THESE- BURDENSOME ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS ON PHARMACIES. M. ARE REMOVED I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WE ABSOLUTELY SHARE. AND A COMMITMENT TO FINDING EFFECTIVE PROVEN WAYS TO COMBAT THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. AND WE DEFINITELY WORK WITH THAT THE AUTHOR IN THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THIS BUT- AT THIS TIME WE ARE OPPOSED AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE. THANK YOU OPEN UP TO ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES- IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION IN THE HEARING ROOM TO ADD ON IS A ME TOO. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- MARC FOR GADABAY HALF OF NATIONAL NONPROFIT SHATTERPROOF FOR THE CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. AND WE ARE DRIVE. THANK YOU. THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM SUPPORT OPPOSITION SAYING NINE ONE OVER THE PHONE LINES FOR ANY YOU WANT TO ADD ON. IN EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE DO HAVE A COMMENT. BEING TAKEN AND- HARD NOT RIPPING ASSIGNED HIM. FOR MISTER CHAIRMAN NORTH. OKAY COVETOUS FROM NINE THIRTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN. THANK YOU FOR A BILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN RESPECTFUL- OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OR OUR MOTION- SECOND. OR MOTIONS ARE SECONDS I THINK WE'VE GOT A QUESTION SOME REWARD TWENTY OFFER I HAVEN'T CONVERSATION WITH ME YESTERDAY- WELL I HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED I'M REALLY ENCOURAGE ONE THAT- AND PLEASE CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD THAT THERE IS AN OPT OUT PROVISION. IN THE EXPLAINED TO THE PATIENTS AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD- TO- ON THE ON ON THE FRONT END THAT'S ALLOWS FOR NOW ABOUT A OF A PRESHEAF YOUR CONTINUED- ONE YOUR YOUR YOUR DEEP STUDY ON THE ISSUE- BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE ON THE WHOLE AND TO YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH- THE OPPOSITION WITH SOME STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL I'LL TRY TO PERFECT THE BILL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT I'LL BE SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOT A MOTION. GOTTA SAY. NEWS OAKLAND DR WEBER. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT- WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND WE NEED TO FIX SOMEONE I THINK ALL OF THE WITNESSES AS WELL FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES WITH US. I YOU KNOW I DEFINITELY WILL BE SUPPORTING AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF JUST CLARIFYING. SO THE OVERALL COST DOLLARS IN DIFFERENT AREAS IS THE TOTAL FOR FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS. IS IT TWO DOLLARS FOR THE VIAL AND THEN TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS BACK TO THE PHARMACIST. NO IT'S CHARACTER A TWO TO. PER LOCKABLE FILE- THE ANTICIPATION AND HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE- OPPOSITION. BUT AS WE KNOW PHARMACIES ARE BUSY PLACES BUT WE'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE SECONDS. FOR THE PHARMACIST TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAM IN. THE LOCKABLE PILL VIAL AND SO. WHILE WE'RE ON THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO ATTRIBUTE THAT COST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS ON. THE MECHANISM THE LOCKABLE PILL VIAL ITSELF. OKAY SO WHEN IT SAYS- I WENT RAN CLAMORING FOR THE COST OF THE LOCKABLE FILE NOT TO EXCEED TWO DOLLARS PROFILE AND FOR THE PHARMACY DISPENSING COSTS AND SERVICES RENDERED NOT TO EXCEED TO FIFTY. I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES THE DISPENSING SERVICES I BELIEVE THE PHARMACIST HAS THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES IT'S FIVE SECONDS ADDED TO THEM PROGRAM AND LOCKABLE PULLED BY I DON'T THINK IT'S- ANY DIFFERENT FROM THEM- ADMINISTERING PRESCRIPTIONS TODAY. OKAY SAID THAT WOULD NOT AT TWO FIFTY IS THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S CURRENTLY IT'S KNOTS TO EXCEED THAT OKAY- IS THERE ANY. THE WAY THAT YOU CAN SEE- AT SOME. THE INCREASE COSTS BEING PASSED TO THE PATIENT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN PROFITING OFF OF THIS OPIOID CRISIS FOR QUITE A WHILE HERE. AND FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE DIRECTING THE COST TO THE MANUFACTURERS IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL- HI I BELIEVE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PROFIT MARGINS OF MANY OF THESE LARGE COMPANIES AS WELL WITHIN THEIR- PROFITS TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB SOME OF THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THIS THE NEW AND IMPROVED WAY. I THINK SINCE IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS SINCE WE'VE DONE CHILD RESISTANT FOX I THINK IT'S LONG PAST TIME. FOR US TO LOOK AT THE MEDIUM IN INSURANCE THE MOST PROTECTIVE THAT WE CAN TO HELP TO ENSURE THAT WHAT OCCURRED HERE IS NOT GOING TO OCCUR AGAIN. NO I AGREE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT AS IT MOVES FOR YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PASS THESE COSTS DOWN TO PATIENTS BECAUSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ARE ALREADY EXTREMELY HIGH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE WOULDN'T WANT THOSE THAT NEED IT TO HAVE THIS AS A BARRIER- I WOULD ALSO JUST- YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE YOU TO. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID HAVE DOWN IS THE UP. FRONT COST BURDEN TO MANY OF THE PHARMACIES- IT MAY NOT BE THAT BIG OF A DEAL FOR SOME OF THE LARGER CHAINS LIKE CVS TO WALGREENS BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE LIKE THE SMALLER. YOU KNOW MOM AND POP PHARMACISTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND- WE WOULDN'T WANT THIS TO BE TOO MUCH OF A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THEM WHERE THEY'RE UP FRONTING THE MONEY AND THEN HAVING TO WAIT. THIS TIME TO GET REIMBURSED BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- DOING THIS AND I'M LOOKING FOR TO SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU AND I WILL JUST ADD IF I CAN THAT CURRENTLY WITH CHILD RESISTANCE LAW- BILES THE PHARMACIES HAVE TO FRONT LOAD THAT COST AND INVENTORY THEM AS WELL AND THEY- ARE NOT ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED OR REBATE FOR THEM. THAT THIS ACTUALLY MAY BE ABLE TO ASSESS SOME OF OUR PHARMACY SINCE WE'RE CREATING A WAY IN WHICH- THE- THAT REBAY. ON AND- WILLING TO WORK THE OFFICE. BUT JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AND BRING THAT UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CNN DOCTOR I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WE HEARD HERE TODAY HOW IT WAS SO EASY FOR SO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE OPIOID MEDICATIONS AND THAT LOCKABLE PILL VIALS ARE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR US TO HELP TO WORK ON THIS OPIOID EPIDEMIC WITH OUR CHILDREN I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT WHAT'S OCCURRED DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND THUS THE NEED FOR THIS BILL IS EVEN MORE NOW THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR WHEN I ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THAT. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I. THANK YOU DR RANDALL AND I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMORIZED. THANK YOU FOR CONFIRMING THAT ON THE RECORD. THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY WHO TESTIFIED TODAY. AND I UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE THIS COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS DO NOT REMOVE THE BILL'S OPPOSITION- BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THEM.

SO WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON IT TOO I BELIEVE SO MEMBER HOLDEN'S BILL ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB. TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY THREE. WARNING MORNING. THE JURY MEMBERS I'M HERE TO DAY 2% ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY THREE BILL THAT SEEKS TO UPDATE OUR OUT OF DATE AND DEEPLY INSUFFICIENT THAT MICROCHIPPING AND PAT THE FLAWS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE HIGH PROFILE INSTANCES OF THAT STUFF. INCLUDING SOME PET OWNERS BEING ROBBED AT GUNPOINT. NO DOUBT THERE HAVE BEEN CONSTITUENTS IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE DRAMATIC LOSS OF A PET. BOB A LOSS OF A PET BY BAD ACTORS LIKE THIEVES. HOWEVER IN MANY US CONSTITUENCIES ONE INDIVIDUAL WITH CONSTITUENT A CURATIVE LENI WAS JOINING US AS A WITNESS TODAY SUFFERED THE THEFT OF HER PET DOG AT THE HANDS OF THE VERY RESCUE GROUP WHICH SOLD HER THE DOG. AND DESPITE THE OBVIOUS OWNERSHIP HE RETAIN NO EXPLICIT LEGAL RIGHTS TO HER DOG BECAUSE THE MICROCHIP WAS REGISTERED WITH THE RESCUE GROUP. AS THE PRIMARY CONTACT. IT IS VITAL THAT WE PROTECT OUR PETS AND CONSUMERS BY ENACTING AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY THREE. THIS BILL UPDATES PET ADOPTION AND MICROCHIPS STANDARDS BY REQUIRING THAT ALL SHELTERS AND RESCUE GROUPS PROVIDE TO ADOPT. A TO BRIDE TO ADOPTERS THE PROPER RESOURCES ACCESS POINTS AND ASSISTANCE WERE UPDATING THE PRIMARY CONTACT REGISTERED. TO THE MICROCHIP IN PLACE IN THE PAST. WITH THE BILL THAT'S TO BE ADOPTED. THIS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT EVERY NEWLY ADOPTED COULD BE MICROCHIPPED WITH INFORMATION REFLECTIVE OF THEIR TRUE OWNER RATHER THAN THE INFORMATION. OF THE SHELTER OR RESCUE GROUP WHICH MERELY HELD THEM UNTIL THEY FOUND THEIR HOME HEIGHTEN STANDARDS OF DUE DILIGENCE FOR PET ADOPTION. ALL SHELTERS AND RESCUE GROUPS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF ALREADY DILIGENT AND GOOD ACTING ORGANIZATIONS BY RELEASING PETS TO OWNERS. WITH THE MOST MEANINGFUL PROOF OF OWNERSHIP AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY MICROCHIP REGISTRATION UNTIL OWNERS ONLY SO LONG AS THEY HAVE NO DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF PET MISTREATMENT. THIS IN EFFECT WILL PREVENT BAD ACTORS FROM RECLAIMING PATHS TO THE DETRIMENT OF WAR AND LOSS OF THE PETS TRUE OWNER. AND IT WILL PREVENT PET ABUSERS FROM ACCESSING ACCESSING LOW LOST PETS WHOSE FAMILIES ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR. LASTLY AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY THREE WILL INCLUSIVELY CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF AT THE- END GIVE OWNERS GREATER REDRESS TO REUNITE WITH THEIR PET.

CORRECT HARPER AND THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF NONPROFIT AND MUNICIPAL ANIMAL SHELTERS AND ANIMAL CONTROL AGENCIES AROUND STATE ORGANIZATION IS OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION UNLESS AMENDED TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT WOULD HAVE A CATASTROPHIC IMPACT ON THEIR OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA'S SHELTERS. WHAT WE DO AGREE THAT SHELTERS AND RESCUES SHOULD NOT BE LISTED AS THE OWNER ON MICROCHIPS ONCE CUT FOR A- YOU'RE SHOWING OPPOSE TO LIMITING DETERMINE OF OWNERSHIP THE NAME LISTED ON THE MARKET. MICROCHIP FOR SIMPLY ONE OF MANY MEANS THAT I DON'T FOR PAT AND OUR ANIMALS PROFESSIONALS NAVIGATE THAT YOU EACH AND EVERY DAY WORKING DILIGENTLY TO RETURN TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS LIMITING. TO THE MICROCHIP ONLY WITHIN THE CAPABILITY OF ID TAG LICENSES AND YEARS OF VETERINARY RECORDS BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE QUALITY CLEANING THEIR ANIMAL ONE SHOULD ALSO BE MINDFUL THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO FEEL AN ANIMAL AND IMMEDIATELY HAVE IT SHIPPED WITH A NEW PARTY INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY WITH NO ALPHA ON THIS LEGISLATION ANIMALS WOULD NEED TO BE HELD INDEFINITELY ANY LEGISLATION THAT IMPACT THE LENGTH OF TIME A SHELTER IS REQUIRED TO CARE FOR AN ANIMAL MUST NOT POWER AS A RESULT IN AN UNFUNDED. MANDATE UNIFICATION CAN BECOME. AND I DON'T. TECH I CONTINUE OF ALL. THERE IS NO. THAT THE- NEEDS TO DICTATE REUNIFICATION EFFORT OTHERS. ARE ALREADY UP NOW THE IT IS. FOUR HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OF ANNA EACH. WE'RE HOPEFUL WORK WITH THE I. OFF FUNDING. THE BILL AT THIS TIME RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NOSE UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A WE HAVE ONE A THIS IN A WIN IS AN OPPOSITE MS. YEAH GOOD MORNING SHERRY MAY IS JOY TOP AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS PERCENT HUMANE SOCIETY AUTHOR IN HIS FOR TACKLE THIS COMP IS. THERE IS A WAY THING WE HOLD AGREE UPON THAT IS IT IS NOT AND- WITH BEST PRACTICES TO ALLOW FOR RESCUE GROUPS OR SHELTERS. TO REMAIN THE PRIMARY CONTACT ON A MICROCHIP ONCE UNLAWFUL ADOPTION IS TAKING PLACE. THAT IS REALLY THE HEART OF THIS ISSUE AND WHAT ALLOW THE RESCUE GROUP INVOLVED IN MISCELLANEOUS CASE TO STILL HER DOG AND PRESENT TO THE COURT THEMSELVES AND THE RIGHTFUL OWNER. WHERE WE DIVERGE IS THE PROVISION THAT ALLOWS- ANIMALS ONLY TO BE RECLAIMED IF THEY HAVE UP TO DATE MICROCHIPS. WELL A USEFUL TOOL MICROCHIPPING IS AN IMPERFECT TECHNOLOGY. UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY SAN DIEGO HUMANE ERRONEOUSLY ASSUMES THAT BECAUSE WE PROVIDED INFORMATION TO NEW PET OWNERS ON HOW TO REGISTER THEMSELVES ON THE CHIP THAT IT WAS HAPPENING. IT WAS ONLY WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF THE MANDATORY MICROCHIP BILL THAT PASSED TWO YEARS AGO THAT WE REALIZE MANY DOCTORS NEVER FOLLOWED THROUGH. WELL WE NOW HAVE AN AUTOMATED PUSH FROM ARE SHELTERING SOFTWARE MICROCHIP COMPANY WE CONTRACT WHEN. THERE COULD BE THOUSANDS OF LAWFUL ADOPTIONS INVALIDATED BY THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE CHIPS WERE NEVER UPDATED ARE REGISTERED. FURTHER THERE ARE DOZENS OF MICROCHIP aPANIES AND THEY DO NOT ALWAYS SHARE INFORMATION AMONG THEMSELVES OR USE A SINGLE PLATFORM TO OF THE ORDER INFORMATION WHEN WHICH EMIT TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP TAKE PLACE. SHELTERS NAVIGATE THESE CHALLENGES BY UTILIZING MORE THAN ONE SOURCE OF OWNERSHIP DOCUMENTATION. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SHELTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE EFFECTIVELY NAVIGATING THE PROCESS OF RETURNING PETS TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS AND ARE EXERCISING THEIR DUE DILIGENCE IN DOING SO. SAN DIEGO HUMANE SOCIETY'S RECLAIM RATE FOR DOGS FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND EIGHT TIMES GREATER FOR CAPS. IT'S OUR ABILITY TO USE THAT- MANY TOOLS OF OWNER IDENTIFICATION SUCH AS COLLARS WITH TAGS VACCINATION HISTORY VETERINARY RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE OWNERSHIP THAT ALLOWS SAN DIEGO HUMANE. SOCIETY TO BE SO SUCCESSFUL WITH A PROGRAMS. WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THE OTHER OFFICE THAT FILL OUT A- AND CAN. WALKING TO ALLOW SOME DOING IN THE REAR. EFFORTS TO USE THEIR EXPERT AND JUDGE. IN THE BASS AND OF LOS PETS IN THE- WE OUR HIS. OPEN TO ENGAGE AND WE WILL FORWARD TO. CHANGES THAT WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION UNTIL THEN UNFORTUNATELY WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FILLS OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IF YOU WANT TO ADD ON IS A ME TOO IN THE HEARING ROOM RIGHT NOW. SEEING NONE. LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR ANY. GONNA ADD ON ME TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND THERE ARE NO COMMENTS TO DISPLAY MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. GEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND SOME HOME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRING THIS LEGISLATION OVER TO- THE YEAR- COMMITTEE. ON I THINK THIS IS A FOR LEGISLATION AS IT'S GOING TO PREVENT SOME NEFARIOUS ISSUES HAPPEN IN TERMS OF SHELTERS PREMATURE RULING- BUT IN GOAL OF THE ANIMAL CAT OR DOG OR EVEN IN SOME CASES SELLING- THE- CAT OR DOG. SO MY QUESTION IS MOSTLY IN TECHNICAL IN TERMS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION- IN THE EVENT. THAT A CAT OR DOG OR ANIMALS BROUGHT TO THE SHELTER AND IT DOES HAVE A CHIP. BUT WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME. OF HOW LONG THE SHELTERS WILL BE HOLDING ON. TO THE CATID ALREADY ANIMAL. BEFORE IN THE EVENT THAT- THE ORIGINAL OWNER CANNOT BE FOUND. AND THAT IT CAN BE ADOPTED BY A NEW OWNER THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE CURRENT STATUTORY TIME FRAMES- TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME RIGHT TO SHARE WITH YOU AT THIS MOMENT BUT IT'S ALREADY SET IN STATUTE AND THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER THE- I THINK I'VE ALSO HEARD SOME MISLEADING INFORMATION JUST ONE CLARIFIED THAT DIED. IN THE EVENT THAT- ANIMALS FOUND WITH A MICROCHIP. THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE AN CHANGE IN TERMS OF. IF THE ORIGINAL OWNERS NOT FOUND THAT THIS WOULD EXPEDITE THE ANIMAL FROM- IN EUTHANIZED OR OR LET GO IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT I'M I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT ISNOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL. YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS NOT INTENT OF THE BILL- AND I MIGHT JUST ALSO SAY IT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL. TO DO AWAY WITH ANY CURRENT PRACTICES THAT. RIGHT ORGANIZATIONS AGENCIES HUMANE SOCIETIES ARE USING AND- SEEING GOOD RESULTS BY. WE'RE SORT OF WALKING INTO AN AREA WHERE CLEARLY THERE IS A DEFICIENCY. WE'RE TRYING TO TIGHTEN THAT PIECE- AND SO WHERE. THE CURRENT OPPOSITION AS INDICATED THEIR CONCERNS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND WILL COME UP WITH THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO A GOOD THING NOT ELIMINATE WHAT ARE ALREADY SUCCESSFUL TECHNIQUES THAT ARE BEING USED. TO REUNITE FAMILIES WITH THEIR LOSS. THANK YOU MR HOLDEN I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND- I KNOW THAT TO YOUR REPUTATION SECOND TO NONE AND- YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I LOOK FORWARD TO A SUPPORT YOUR BILL AT THIS TIME. BECAUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SHORT. THANK AT ONE APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT IS GOING TO BE POSITIVE AND I NEED TO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE SAN DIEGO HUMANE SOCIETY I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MULTIPLE CHAPTERS OF THE MEANS OF THE MID SIZE ACROSS THE STATE- AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THEM AS WELL SO TODAY I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- BUT TO ANY EXTENT THAT WE CAN WORK ON OPTIONS FOR- DEMONSTRATING OWNERSHIP. AND ALSO WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO ON HOUSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BONDED WITH THEIR PETS I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL AS THIS APPROACH IS THE FLOOR THANK YOU APPRECIATE. YOU MISTER WARD BONTA AT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AYE AYE MY DOG LEGO LOS ALSO THINKS YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WE IN OUR DISTRICT ACTUALLY HAVE IN MY CITY IN PARTICULAR RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON AT NONPROFIT RESCUE SHELTER TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THAT ENSURE THAT THERE WON'T BE ANY ADDITIONAL BURDEN PLACED ON ON SHELTERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND IT'S ALREADY A PART OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT WE CONTINUE TO UNDER INVEST IN- AS A SOCIETY AND TO AND HOPING THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR- OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T ANY ADDITIONAL BURDEN THAT WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE. ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY OWNERSHIP- TO ENSURE RAINY REUNIFICATION WHEN THEY NEED NOT ONLY IN THE CHIP AND KNOW THAT WE WILL GET THERE I WITH THIS AND FOR THAT REASON THOSE REASONS I WILL BE VOTING YES ON THIS. NAME IS BONTA ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR MOTIONS OR SECONDS. GOT A MOTION GOT A SECOND- HOLDEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- YES RESEARCHER AND COMMITTEE I FIRST OF ALL I JUST APPRECIATE- THE IMPORTANCE OF.

AND THEN OF COURSE I'M- THEN OKAY WILL DRIVE AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE FIRST THING THAT CAME INTO OUR MIND WAS DO WE GET A CHIP. AND WE DID BURKE THERE WE REGISTER THE CHIP YOU KNOW SO THERE'S ALL THESE THINGS THAT START RUNNING THROUGH YOUR MIND AFTER THE FACT- IT IS TO SAY- HE WAS ON THE NEIGHBOR'S PORCH. A CHASING AFTER SOMETHING SO IT WORKED OUT BUT THERE WAS THAT PERIOD OF TIME. WHERE YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE JUST WHAT HAPPENED.

I APOLOGIZE HOW DO EVER SKINNING TWO QUICK NOW IT'S FINE IT'S FINE- I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INTRODUCING THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BELL- YOU KNOW I THINK OVER TIME WE HAVE. I'M HAS WE'VE EXPANDED SCOPE OF PRACTICE- WE RECOGNIZE THAT- PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL YOU KNOW PHYSICIAN- ODD YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE SETTING HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN- HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR PATIENTS I THINK- EQUALITY CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY SAID IT VERY WELL- WHEN THEY SAID. THAT THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE ROLE THAT PHARMACISTS PLAY IN CLOSING HEALTH GAPS FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'M I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED- TO SEE THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CULTURAL COMPETENCY- WE ARE ONLY DOING IT FOR AN HOUR. AND BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO WITH CULTURAL WITHIN CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND ALSO THAT WE DIDN'T TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SEPARATE OR TO ALSO INCLUDE SPECIFICS ON- THE DISPARITIES THAT YOU SEE WITHIN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN AND I KNOW THAT'S A PART IT SAYS. IT'LL BE A PART OF IT BUT YOU CAN'T FIT ALL OF THAT WITHIN AN HOUR- RECOGNIZING THAT JUST WITH THE PREP IN THE PATH- YOU KNOW HELPING COMPLIANCE WITH THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DIABETES HYPERTENSION AND PEOPLE ARE COMING IN FROM THEIR MEDICATIONS WE'VE EXPANDED THE SCOPE FOR VACCINES AND- WE EVEN HEARD YOU KNOW PHARMACISTS NOW WHEN IT PRESCRIBE BIRTH CONTROL PILLS THAT- THAT INTERACTION. ALSO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CULTURAL COMPETENCY YES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE CULTURALLY COMPETENT WHEN DEALING WITH LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER COMMUNITY THAT MARGINALIZE AND THAT'S OUR ARE BLACK AND LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN AND SOUTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF WE HAD OR IF YOU HAD- MAYBE BROKEN THAT OUT MAYBE HAD TWO HOURS OF REQUIREMENT- IN THEIR IN THEIR LICENSURE- OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS BECAUSE THAT. ASPECT IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD- IS TO HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANY PUSH BACK FROM THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY ON THE REQUIREMENT OF THE SUBMISSION OF PROOF- VERSUS THE RANDOM AUDIT THAT THEY USUALLY DO. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS DR WEBER- I'LL SAY TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION OR TO REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR FIRST COMMENT- YOU KNOW THIS IS INTENDED TO BE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE EXISTING PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE CAN FOCUS IN ON. AREAS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AREAS IN WHICH- MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE AS DIVERSE AS THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND WE INTEND TO BE AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE AND ADDRESSING THOSE HEALTH DISPARITIES PARTICULARLY IS THE ADDRESS OF THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY AS THE ADDRESS WOMEN'S AND TRANS RELATED ISSUES AS WELL. WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND QUESTION- WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THAT ORGANIZATION YET BUT I WILL DEFER TO OUR PRIMARY WITNESS FROM THE PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. DR VAN ALLEN IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. NO PRESS. OREGON QUESTION- IF I CAN JUST CLARIFY I THINK THAT'S THE POINT REGARDING OUR- OF PRINTING EDUCATION WILL BE KEY I THANK CURRENTLY HELPING A TRACK IN THE PHARMACY CURRICULUM AS PHARMACISTS. NOT TREATING AND- ACCUMULATING AND THE SECOND PART IS. FOR THE BOARD THE PHARMACY HAVE YET TO IT HEARD ANY- PUSHED. BACK SO FAR. OKAY THANK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S THEY THEY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE GIVING LICENSORS. AND THAT'S WHY THEY USUALLY DO LIKE YOU KNOW MEDICAL BOARD AND ALL OF THESE LARGE FORCE JUST TO KIND OF RANDOM AUDITS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR LICENSEES. ARE ACTUALLY DOING THEIR REQUIREMENTS SO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ACTUALLY WAIT TO ACTUALLY GET PROOF OF EACH PERSON MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT BURDENSOME FOR THEM AND THEY MAY BE CONTACTING YOU AT SOME POINT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU DR WEBER. SOMBERLY GUESTS ARE PROUD TO BE JOIN AUTHOR ON THIS WITH YOU AS A MEMBER WARD AND I THINK IT'S- COURSE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE EDUCATING OUR PHARMACISTS ABOUT THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT OUR COMMUNITY BEACON K. FACES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN THAT STILL. LASSEN FOR SOME OF THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO JUST A REMINDER YOU KNOW BY BY DEFINITION THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY'S INTERSECTIONAL WE COME FROM ALL RACES AND BACKGROUNDS IS REALLY GREAT THAT WE GET THIS IN AND HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE MORE GROUNDWORK LAID FOR MORE CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AND I WITH THAT A MOVE THE BILL. ALREADY GOT THE MOTION OF THE SECOND. BUT I APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE NONE THE STORE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON THANK YOU MEMBERS AT PLEASURE JOINING YOU THIS MORNING AND- I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OF ALL THANKS FOR JOINING THE COMMITTEE IN AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND THANK YOU TO THE SPONSORS FOR PROACTIVELY SEEKING TO IMPROVE.
