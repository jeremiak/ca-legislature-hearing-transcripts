KNOW THIS IS VARIAS SENSITIVITY

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:50.060 region:rollup2
ISSUE. THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:52.229 region:rollup2

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.998 region:rollup2

BUT THAT DOES FAR.

00:49:07.011 --> 00:49:12.883 region:rollup2
BUT. IN MOST CASES.

00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:14.351 region:rollup2
THE SMOKER WAS JUST A FLOOR

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:17.288 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE THAT THE WIND BLOW

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:19.423 region:rollup2

BEACHES IN PARTICULAR AND THAT'S

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:47.751 region:rollup2

MISTER HARPER.

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:03.133 region:rollup2
I'VE EXPRESS SOME OF THESE

00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:05.869 region:rollup2
ISSUES UP BEFORE AND NOT IN

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:07.104 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS BLLS. ON.

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:09.072 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S

00:55:07.104 --> 00:55:10.374 region:rollup2
TWO HARMS THAT ARE EXPRESSED HER

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:11.909 region:rollup2
TO AREAS TO SEE AGAINST THAT ARE

00:55:10.374 --> 00:55:12.543 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED OF ONE IS THE LITTER

00:55:11.909 --> 00:55:15.078 region:rollup2
SIDE.

00:55:12.543 --> 00:55:17.481 region:rollup2
OF WHICH I YOU CAN MAKE CASE IN

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:19.650 region:rollup2
TERMS OF FILTERS OF CIGARETTES

00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:21.218 region:rollup2
UP BUT IN TERMS OF CIGARS YOU

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:24.054 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT FILTER ISSUE AND

00:55:21.218 --> 00:55:26.190 region:rollup2
SO. I THAT I THINK IS SOMETHING

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:28.058 region:rollup2
THAT. I THINK MAY BE PROBLEMATIC

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:29.860 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF DATA KIND OF AN

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:31.361 region:rollup2
ISSUE ALSO IN TERMS OF.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.630 region:rollup2
VAPING PRODUCTS AND SUCH LIKE

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:35.399 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:37.334 region:rollup2
AYE DOCUMENTATION OR SHOWING

00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:39.303 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S A CONTRIBUTOR ON A

00:55:37.334 --> 00:55:40.270 region:rollup2
LETTER SITE PEOPLE SEEM TO WANT

00:55:39.303 --> 00:55:42.039 region:rollup2

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:43.907 region:rollup2
PRODUCT IN TERMS OF.

00:55:42.039 --> 00:55:45.042 region:rollup2
OF THOSE HAVE VAPING PRODUCTS

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:47.811 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ENSURE WHY

00:55:45.042 --> 00:55:48.545 region:rollup2
DOES HER INCLUDE NAFTA

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:49.847 region:rollup2
SECONDHAND SMOKE SIDE.

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:52.549 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE YOU HAVE VERSES

00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:54.451 region:rollup2
MAYBE SOME INLAND PARK AREAS IS

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:56.086 region:rollup2
THAT SMOKING IS AT THE BEACH

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:57.387 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY IS VERY DISPERSED

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.689 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:59.223 region:rollup2
WEATHER AT THE BEACH THERE'S

00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:00.791 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY EITHER AN OCEAN

00:55:59.223 --> 00:56:01.792 region:rollup2
BREEZE.

00:56:00.791 --> 00:56:04.361 region:rollup2
OR HEAVY OF.

00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:05.929 region:rollup2
HEAVY OCEAN WINDS UP ONE OF THE

00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:08.265 region:rollup2
OTHER VERY MUCH DISPERSES

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:10.300 region:rollup2
I ANY KIND OF A SMOKER

00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:10.934 region:rollup2
SECONDHAND SMOKE SECTOR. I KNOW

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.069 region:rollup2
ONLY THAT BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:15.138 region:rollup2
ROOM AT THE BEACH.

00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:16.106 region:rollup2
IN WHICH A PEOPLE CAN NOW I GO

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:17.374 region:rollup2
TO AN AREA WHERE THERE IS

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.675 region:rollup2
SMOKING WHERE THERE'S NOT

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:20.878 region:rollup2
SMOKING EXCEPT FOR.

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:22.179 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE

00:56:20.878 --> 00:56:23.714 region:rollup2
ODD THAT THAT IS INDEED

00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:25.315 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND SO I THINK THAT

00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:27.251 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE CAN.

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:28.051 region:rollup2
COEXIST ARE ON A BEACH BECAUSE

00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:29.052 region:rollup2
THERECERTAINLY IS ROOM

ESPECIALLY WITH THE A

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:32.656 region:rollup2
DISBURSEMENT SMOKE.

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:34.892 region:rollup2
I AND LASTLY I DON'T SEE THE

00:56:32.656 --> 00:56:37.160 region:rollup2
HARM IN SOMEBODY SMOKING A CIGAR

00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:38.729 region:rollup2
NEXT TO A BEACH BONFIRE RING.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.864 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IS SMOKE.

00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:43.533 region:rollup2
SMOKE IS ALREADY THERE WITH THE

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:44.268 region:rollup2
UPBEAT BONFIRE AYE IN SO WHAT TO

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:46.336 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT.

00:56:44.268 --> 00:56:47.371 region:rollup2
