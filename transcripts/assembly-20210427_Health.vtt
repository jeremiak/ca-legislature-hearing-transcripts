RAISED BY OPPOSITION. I DIDN'T

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:40.802

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:41.937
FIRST PART OF THE BILL WHICH

SIMPLY ALIGNS THE ALGORITHMS

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.173
WITH EVIDENCE BASED CARE AND I

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.675
THINK THAT'S- FAIRLY SELF

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:47.843
EVIDENT AND PROBABLY LEAD TO

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.845
COST SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN-

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:53.482
AS TO THE TWELVE VISITS. I

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:54.082
THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:56.752
ARE GONNA. SORT OF GO SEE SIX

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:57.953
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARE

01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.755
PROVIDERS TWELVE TIMES EACH IS

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.223
A LITTLE BIT OF A RED HERRING

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.791
RESPECTFULLY. I MEAN THIS IS

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:03.926
LIMITED TO CHIROPACTIC

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.594

MEDICINE AN AUDITORY THERAPIES.

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.000
SO IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.368
YOUR HEARING OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:15.337
THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY UNLIKELY

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.338
TO GO TO A PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.439
THEY PROBABLY GOT A PHYSICAL

WITH YOUR NEAR YOUR BACK OR SO

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.610
FOR SO I DON'T THINK THESE-

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:22.978
THAT THAT RISK I THINK IT'S

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:24.379
PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT.

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.315
OVERBLOWN AND AGAIN. AT THE END

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:27.950

TO. SORT OF ARBITRARY DECISIONS

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.898

NOT SURE WHY IT PATIENTS.

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:27.047
PREMIUM WOULD GO TO THE

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:28.115
BUSINESS AND THAT WAY INSTEAD

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:29.216

THAT. ALREADY BASICALLY

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:33.553
STRUCTURED TO PROVIDE HELP OF

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.388
BUSINESS DURING SOME SORT OF.

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:37.357
CRISIS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:39.392

POLICIES INSTEAD OF CREATING

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:50.403

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:51.338
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER I'M

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:56.009
SURE SHE CAN ANSWER. THE MORE

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.477
OF A STATEMENT THAN A QUESTION.

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.812
A QUESTION A QUESTION I

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:00.447
ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:02.516
ADJUST THE PREMIUM WHY CHANGE

01:47:02.582 --> 01:47:04.518
THE FLOW OF THE PREMIUMS WHY

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:07.621
NOT JUST REQUEST THAT BUSINESS

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:09.289
INTERRUPTION INSURANCE. COVER

01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:12.793
PANDEMICS. SINCE THE BUSINESS

01:47:12.859 --> 01:47:15.395
ALREADY PROBABLY PAYS FOR THAT.

01:47:15.462 --> 01:47:17.197
COMMENT FROM THE QUESTION THE

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.865
ANSWER TO QUESTION- I THINK

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:19.933
THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.101
AROUND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:21.768
APPROPRIATE FOR BUSINESS

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:22.936
INTERRUPTION INSURANCE TO COVER

01:47:23.003 --> 01:47:24.805
PANDEMICS I THINK- MY

01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:26.540
UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE ISSUES

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:27.874
IS THAT GENERALLY IT'S SO

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:29.976
CATASTROPHIC THAT IT IS IT'S

01:47:30.043 --> 01:47:31.178
THEYHAVE TO HAVE THOSE KIND OF

01:47:31.244 --> 01:47:32.946
WAIVERS IN THERE BECAUSE THE-

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:33.747
THE INSURANCE CAN'T REALLY

01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:36.283
AFFORD TO COVER THAT- AS FAR AS

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:37.818
WHY WE DID IT THIS WAY. THE

01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:39.486
PLANS DO HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO

02:43:38.942 --> 02:43:40.610
MORE FAVORABLE THAN GENERALLY

OF CARE REFORM THAT. WE'VE BEEN

03:01:58.641 --> 03:01:59.942
WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF

03:02:00.009 --> 03:02:02.244
YEARS WE'VE CREATED A DIFFERENT

03:02:02.311 --> 03:02:04.280
FRAMEWORK FOR DEALING WITH KIDS

03:02:04.346 --> 03:02:05.948
IN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. BUT

03:02:06.015 --> 03:02:07.850
ONE OF THE GAPS THAT HAD REALLY

03:02:07.916 --> 03:02:10.386
YET TO BE FULFILLED WORK. KIDS

03:02:10.452 --> 03:02:11.787
WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS AND

03:02:11.854 --> 03:02:13.055
ULTIMATELY THE STATE ENDED UP

03:02:13.122 --> 03:02:14.657
SENDING THOSE KIDS. OUT OF

03:02:14.723 --> 03:02:17.559
STATE. AND CERTIFYING VARIOUS

03:02:17.626 --> 03:02:19.828
NUMBERS OF FACILITIES. DUE TO

03:02:19.895 --> 03:02:20.462
SOME PROBLEMS OF THOSE

03:02:20.529 --> 03:02:21.630
FACILITIES THE STATE ENDED UP

03:02:21.697 --> 03:02:23.532

AND THIRTY SOME ODD. AND THAT

03:02:28.037 --> 03:02:29.338
RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHY

03:02:29.405 --> 03:02:31.073
CALIFORNIA CANNOT DEVELOP THE

03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:33.175
CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH ALL THOSE

03:02:33.242 --> 03:02:34.243
KIDS REGARDLESS OF LEVEL OF

03:02:34.310 --> 03:02:36.045
NEED IN STATE AND THAT'S WHAT

03:02:36.111 --> 03:02:38.080
AB EIGHT AWAIT IS ABOUT IT IS

03:02:38.147 --> 03:02:42.217
CREATING. A CRISIS SUPPORT FOR

KIDS WITH THE HIGHEST MEANS IN

03:02:43.719 --> 03:02:45.654
THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE AS

03:02:45.721 --> 03:02:47.489
WELL AS WITH HUMAN SERVICES IS

03:02:47.556 --> 03:02:49.491
IT COMBINES MENTAL HEALTH

03:02:49.558 --> 03:02:51.393
FACILITIES AS WELL AS THIS

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:52.227
GROUP CRISIS INTERVENTION

FACILITY IN A PILOT PROGRAM

03:02:55.097 --> 03:02:56.365
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO SEE IF

03:02:56.432 --> 03:02:58.133
WE CAN REALLY FILL IN THE GAP

03:02:58.200 --> 03:03:00.002
AND DEVELOP THAT CAPACITY DEAL

03:03:00.069 --> 03:03:01.737
WITH THESE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:03:01.804 --> 03:03:03.405
OBVIATING THE NEED TO SEND THEM

03:03:03.472 --> 03:03:04.306
OUT OF STATE WHICH WOULD BE

03:03:04.373 --> 03:03:06.275
ULTIMATELY A VERY GOOD THING

03:03:06.342 --> 03:03:08.577
FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHAT ABA

03:03:08.644 --> 03:03:11.613
DALY IS IT. THESE ARE.

03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:12.915

INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED TOWARDS

03:03:14.850 --> 03:03:16.452
THE KIDS. AND AT THE HIGHEST

03:03:16.518 --> 03:03:17.619
LEVEL THERE WOULD BE SOME

03:03:17.686 --> 03:03:19.788
FAIRLY RAPID STEP DOWN. OUT OF

03:03:19.855 --> 03:03:21.957
THOSE AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE

03:03:22.024 --> 03:03:23.692

03:03:50.686 --> 03:03:51.687

WHILE SEIZE CONCERNS I THINK

03:17:21.329 --> 03:17:23.164
ARE WELL TAKEN IT IN FOUNDED IN

03:17:23.231 --> 03:17:25.333
THE FACT THAT WHEN THOSE

HUNDRED THIRTY THREE KIDS WERE

03:17:26.034 --> 03:17:27.035

ALL PLACED WITH INDIVIDUAL

03:17:33.575 --> 03:17:34.842
FAMILIES AND THAT BEGS THE

03:17:34.909 --> 03:17:36.744
QUESTION OF WHY THEY WERE SENT

03:17:36.811 --> 03:17:38.680
OUT OF STATE IN THE FIRST PLACE

03:17:38.746 --> 03:17:39.681
BY THREE IS THIS IS A PILOT

03:17:53.995 --> 03:17:55.797
THE CERTIFIED. AND WHAT WE'RE

03:17:55.863 --> 03:17:56.931
TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE AN

03:17:56.998 --> 03:17:59.033
OPTION HERE AS THE S. AS DOES

03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:02.337
THE GAP ANALYSIS THAT THEY ARE

03:18:02.403 --> 03:18:02.971
SUPPOSED TO DO. WE'RE TRYING TO

03:18:03.037 --> 03:18:05.406
PROVIDE A REAL OPTION. THAT

03:18:05.473 --> 03:18:06.975
PROVIDES THAT THAT KIND OF A

03:18:07.041 --> 03:18:09.010
PLACEMENT THAT. CARRIES ARE

03:18:09.077 --> 03:18:10.378
CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T HAVE IN

03:18:10.445 --> 03:18:11.846
CALIFORNIA. THAT MAKES THEM

03:18:11.913 --> 03:18:14.315
WANT TO LOOK. OUT OF STATE AND

03:18:14.382 --> 03:18:15.450
THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY

03:18:15.516 --> 03:18:16.851

03:18:16.918 --> 03:18:19.887
BUDGET. ASK AS WELL TO INVEST

03:18:19.954 --> 03:18:22.257

FILL THEM AND THAT IS

03:18:30.531 --> 03:18:31.299
ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT WE'RE

03:18:31.366 --> 03:18:33.067
TRYING TO DO HERE. WHAT WE TRY

03:18:33.134 --> 03:18:34.135
TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE

03:18:34.202 --> 03:18:35.703

THE. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN TWO

03:49:05.932 --> 03:49:06.432
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BECAUSE ME

03:49:06.499 --> 03:49:07.733
FEDERAL FARM BILL HER FIGHT

03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:09.302
THAT INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS AN

03:49:09.368 --> 03:49:11.137
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. I'M

03:49:11.204 --> 03:49:12.905
REMOVED INGREDIENTS AND HELP

03:49:12.972 --> 03:49:16.075
FROM THE FEDERAL DRUG FOOD AND

03:49:16.142 --> 03:49:17.443

CALIFORNIA LEGALIZED CANNABIS

IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

03:49:30.923 --> 03:49:31.891
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FEDERAL

03:49:31.958 --> 03:49:33.359
GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THE

03:49:33.426 --> 03:49:36.662
CANNABIS IS ILLEGAL. IRONICALLY

03:49:36.729 --> 03:49:37.730
WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:49:37.797 --> 03:49:39.198
HAS REMOVED BARRIERS TO THE

03:49:39.265 --> 03:49:41.100
LEGAL USE OF HAMPER DERIVED

03:49:41.167 --> 03:49:43.803
PRODUCTS INCLUDING CBD

03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:46.072
CALIFORNIA HAS NOT TAKEN A

03:49:46.139 --> 03:49:48.307
SIMILAR APPROACH. CALIFORNIA

03:49:48.374 --> 03:49:49.709
CURRENTLY ALLOWS THE

03:49:49.775 --> 03:49:52.211
MANUFACTURING AND SALE OF

03:49:52.278 --> 03:49:54.213
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA PRODUCTS

03:49:54.280 --> 03:49:56.649
INCLUDING FOOD AND DRINKS YEAH

03:49:56.716 --> 03:49:58.818
ONE OF HIM IS THE SOURCE OF CBD

03:49:58.885 --> 03:50:00.920
TO BE ADDED TO FOOD PRODUCTS IT

03:50:00.987 --> 03:50:04.724
IS PROHIBITED. MANY PEOPLE HAVE

03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:06.759
BEEN PURCHASING HIM DERIVE CBD

03:50:06.826 --> 03:50:08.361
PRODUCTS AT THE LOCAL NATURAL

03:50:08.427 --> 03:50:11.030
FOODS SHOPS. FITNESS CENTERS

03:50:11.097 --> 03:50:12.465
AND EVEN HIGH END DEPARTMENT

03:50:12.532 --> 03:50:15.501
STORES FOR SOME TIME. AND THIS

03:50:15.568 --> 03:50:20.473
IS A LEGAL. IN FACT SENIORS ARE-A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

03:50:20.540 --> 03:50:22.341
PEOPLE CHOOSING TO USE HEMP

03:50:22.408 --> 03:50:25.545
CBD. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT

03:50:25.611 --> 03:50:26.012
TO VISIT THE MARIJUANA

03:50:26.078 --> 03:50:29.382
DISPENSARY. THE MANUFACTURE AND

03:50:29.448 --> 03:50:33.419
SALE OF CBD DERIVED FROM HEMP-IS A RAPIDLY EXPANDING BUSINESS

03:50:33.486 --> 03:50:35.955
IN CALIFORNIA WITH MILLIONS OF

03:50:36.022 --> 03:50:37.190
DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC

03:50:37.256 --> 03:50:39.525
PRODUCTIVITY. SHOULD THE STATE

03:50:39.592 --> 03:50:41.460
CHOOSE NOT TO CLARIFY THAT HEMP

03:50:41.527 --> 03:50:43.396
CBD PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL FOR SALE

03:50:43.462 --> 03:50:46.566
AND CONSUMPTION BUSINESSES AND

03:50:46.632 --> 03:50:49.669
THEIR TAX REVENUES ARE LOST. WE

03:50:49.735 --> 03:50:52.371
HAVE A WILD WILD WEST FOR CBD

03:50:52.438 --> 03:50:53.639

STORES UNWITTINGLY FILLING ON

03:50:56.209 --> 03:50:58.177
REGULATED PRODUCTS. I DON'T

STATE FOR FOREIGN PRODUCTS.

03:51:04.483 --> 03:51:07.153
THEY ARE UNSAFE. WHILE OUR

03:51:07.220 --> 03:51:09.021
FARMERS AND BUSINESSES LOSE

03:51:09.088 --> 03:51:12.458
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AB FORTY

03:51:12.525 --> 03:51:13.893
FIVE WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO

03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:15.995
MAKE IT EASIER TO ACCESS A NON

03:51:16.062 --> 03:51:18.064
INTOXICATING ALTERNATIVE

03:51:18.130 --> 03:51:20.366
PRODUCT CONSUMERS WANT AND FOR

03:51:20.433 --> 03:51:23.202
FARMERS TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES

03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:25.404

04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:14.398
HARM YOU KNOW THAT THE CURRENT

FOR SO MANY COMMUTES AROUND

04:25:17.768 --> 04:25:19.270

GOD SO. OKAY GOOD- YES YOU- SO

04:25:33.851 --> 04:25:35.686
THE BILL. JUST QUICKLY FROM

04:25:35.753 --> 04:25:37.821
HONG THE BILL REQUIRES THAT AT

04:25:37.888 --> 04:25:40.991
THE TIME OF SENTENCING. IF THE

04:25:41.058 --> 04:25:42.793
JUDGE MUST OFFER THE DEFENDANT

04:25:42.860 --> 04:25:44.561
VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN THE

04:25:44.628 --> 04:25:47.164
PILOT PROGRAM AS AN ALTERNATIVE

04:25:47.231 --> 04:25:50.467
TO JAIL. OR PRISON SENTENCE

04:25:50.534 --> 04:25:51.835
THAT THE JUDGE WOULD OTHERWISE

04:25:51.902 --> 04:25:54.071
IMPOSE IF THERE'S CERTAIN

04:25:54.138 --> 04:25:59.043

WOULDN'T BE FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS

04:26:10.154 --> 04:26:11.822
I THINK THIS IS BASED UPON THE

04:26:11.889 --> 04:26:13.757
EVALUATIONS WITH MEDICAL

04:26:13.824 --> 04:26:15.592

TIME OF SENTENCING IF THERE'S

04:26:31.608 --> 04:26:33.077
SOME INDICATION BY ANY OF THE

04:26:33.143 --> 04:26:34.578
PARTIES THAT THE SUSPECT THAT

04:26:34.645 --> 04:26:36.280

YOU FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE IN

05:09:17.605 --> 05:09:19.741
THIS AREA MISTER NAZARIAN- I

05:09:19.807 --> 05:09:20.775
KNOW WE'VE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR

05:09:20.842 --> 05:09:22.944
AND- I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE%

05:09:23.011 --> 05:09:25.013
YOUR WORK ON THIS. I HAVE TO

05:09:25.079 --> 05:09:26.681
REFLECT ENOUGH INSULIN WAS

05:09:26.748 --> 05:09:29.984
INVENTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE

05:09:30.051 --> 05:09:32.921
FIRST USED IN NINETEEN TWENTY

05:09:32.987 --> 05:09:35.056
TO NINETY NINE YEARS AGO. THE

05:09:35.123 --> 05:09:37.058
FACT THAT IT ISN'T AFFORDABLE

05:09:37.125 --> 05:09:39.928
FOR PEOPLE TODAY. IS A TRAVESTY

05:09:39.994 --> 05:09:41.863
IN MY OPINION THE FACT THAT

05:09:41.930 --> 05:09:43.197
YOUR BILL WOULD CAUSE A

05:09:43.264 --> 05:09:45.166
POTENTIAL ONE DOLLAR INCREASE

05:09:45.233 --> 05:09:48.636
IN MONTHLY PREMIUMS FOR HEALTH

05:09:48.703 --> 05:09:50.605
PLANS IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY I

05:09:50.672 --> 05:09:53.007
BELIEVE. I AGREE WITH THE

05:09:53.074 --> 05:09:54.842
OPPOSITION THAT IT DOESN'T DO

05:09:54.909 --> 05:09:56.511
ANYTHING TO DEAL WITH THE

05:09:56.577 --> 05:09:59.047
UNDERLYING COSTS- MET OF

05:09:59.113 --> 05:10:00.782
PHARMACEUTICALS. BUT WE'RE

05:10:00.848 --> 05:10:02.951
WORKING ON THAT. THROUGH A BILL

05:10:03.017 --> 05:10:04.152
CALLED THE OFFICE THAT THAT'S

05:10:04.218 --> 05:10:05.553
GONNA IS TOTALLY ESTABLISHED

05:10:05.620 --> 05:10:06.287
THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE

05:10:06.354 --> 05:10:08.356
AFFORDABILITY. FOR EVERYONE

05:10:08.423 --> 05:10:10.591
WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CAR

05:10:10.658 --> 05:10:11.693
THE INCREASING COSTS IN HEALTH

05:10:11.759 --> 05:10:16.030
CARE. SO I DO QUESTION TO.

05:10:16.097 --> 05:10:17.932
WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE

05:10:17.999 --> 05:10:19.267
CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF MANDATES

05:10:19.334 --> 05:10:20.969
AND THAT AS WE'VE HEARD THAT

05:10:21.035 --> 05:10:21.836
MESSAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN

05:10:21.903 --> 05:10:25.306
TODAY- WE WERE OPPOSED BECAUSE

05:10:25.373 --> 05:10:26.441
OF THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

05:10:26.507 --> 05:10:29.277
MANDATES- I DO WONDER YOU KNOW

05:10:29.344 --> 05:10:30.545
THE COST TO THE SYSTEM OF

05:10:30.611 --> 05:10:32.613
SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T ABLE TO

05:10:32.680 --> 05:10:34.449
COMPLY WITH THEIR- INSULIN

05:10:34.515 --> 05:10:35.883
COSTS AND ENDS UP NEEDING MORE

05:10:35.950 --> 05:10:37.986
EXPENSIVE TREATMENT. I DO HAVE

05:10:38.052 --> 05:10:39.854
TO WONDER WHAT IF THERE IS IF

05:10:39.921 --> 05:10:41.756
THERE IS NOT SOME OFFSET THERE.

05:10:41.823 --> 05:10:44.158
SO SO I UNDERSTAND THE

05:10:44.225 --> 05:10:46.627
OPPOSITION- WE'RE TRYING TO

05:10:46.694 --> 05:10:48.129
FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. I'M

05:10:48.196 --> 05:10:50.798
DISAPPOINTED THAT- THE MARKET

05:10:50.865 --> 05:10:53.701
IS WHAT IT IS THEY CHARGE WHAT

05:10:53.768 --> 05:10:56.037
THEY CAN BECAUSE THEY CAN- AND

05:10:56.104 --> 05:10:57.772
THERE IS NO PUSH BACK BUT-

05:10:57.839 --> 05:10:59.307
WE'RE TRYING. AND I BELIEVE WE

05:10:59.374 --> 05:11:02.343
HAVE A SOLUTION IN THE MEANTIME

05:11:02.410 --> 05:11:03.978
A SOLUTION LIKE THIS. IS BETTER

05:11:04.045 --> 05:11:06.047
THAN NO SOLUTION AT ALL. AND I

05:11:06.114 --> 05:11:08.082
I'M- I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A

05:11:08.149 --> 05:11:08.683
CO AUTHOR TO YOUR BILL IF YOU

05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:12.420
HAVE ANY. IDEA I'D BE HONORED

05:11:12.487 --> 05:11:14.055
TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND

05:11:14.122 --> 05:11:15.790
YET. YOU DO A QUICK GOOGLE

05:11:15.857 --> 05:11:19.527
SEARCH- IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE

05:11:19.594 --> 05:11:21.229
IF YOU JUST RIGHT NOW I JUST

05:11:21.295 --> 05:11:22.730
DID A GOOGLE SEARCH JUST SO

05:11:22.797 --> 05:11:26.034
THAT I CAN SPOT A FEW NUMBERS-

05:11:26.100 --> 05:11:27.802
MINIMUM NIGHTLY COST ENOUGH

05:11:27.869 --> 05:11:30.204
HOSPITAL IS TEN THOUSAND SEVEN

05:11:30.271 --> 05:11:33.141
HUNDRED DOLLARS GOES UP TO

05:11:33.207 --> 05:11:34.075
FIFTEEN THOUSAND I EVEN SAW

05:11:34.142 --> 05:11:35.843
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND- AND IT

05:11:35.910 --> 05:11:37.412
DEPENDS ON THE STUDY OF THE

05:11:37.478 --> 05:11:38.713
YEAR AS WELL THE ONE THAT I

05:11:38.780 --> 05:11:40.715
LOOKED THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND

05:11:40.782 --> 05:11:42.016
EIGHTEEN ANOTHER ONE WAS A TWO

05:11:42.083 --> 05:11:45.053
TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY. WE KNOW

05:11:45.119 --> 05:11:47.555
WHAT THE COSTS ARE. AND WE KNOW

05:11:47.622 --> 05:11:51.292
HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS. SO IT'S A

05:11:51.359 --> 05:11:53.628
BASIC SIMPLE MATH FOR ME YOU

05:11:53.694 --> 05:11:56.297
HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLIENTS

05:11:56.364 --> 05:12:01.335
WHO NEED THIS. A SUBSET OF THAT

05:12:01.402 --> 05:12:01.803
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

05:12:01.869 --> 05:12:03.171
CALIFORNIA'S NEED THIS HAVE

05:12:03.237 --> 05:12:05.440
DIABETES AND NEEDED 10% OF IT

05:12:05.506 --> 05:12:07.108
WILL DIE IF THEY DON'T USE

05:12:07.175 --> 05:12:10.078
INSULIN. AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE

05:12:10.144 --> 05:12:14.982
FOR THEM. THIS DRUG. IN A WAY

05:12:15.049 --> 05:12:17.418
WHERE IT'S AFFORDABLE. AND IT

05:12:17.485 --> 05:12:19.620
DOESN'T OVERALL RAISE THE COST

05:12:19.687 --> 05:12:21.422
TOO MUCH I WOULDBE HAPPY TO

05:12:21.489 --> 05:12:24.225
PAY A ONE DOLLAR EXTRA MONTH.

05:12:24.292 --> 05:12:26.661
IF THAT MEANS A CERTAIN

05:12:26.727 --> 05:12:29.564
PERCENTAGE OF THAT FORTY

05:12:29.630 --> 05:12:31.499
THOUSAND PATIENTS DON'T RATION

05:12:31.566 --> 05:12:34.869
THE DRUGS. AND DON'T END UP IN

05:12:34.936 --> 05:12:36.838
AN EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE

05:12:36.904 --> 05:12:39.740
PAYING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

05:12:39.807 --> 05:12:41.709
NINETY IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM. IS

05:12:41.776 --> 05:12:44.145
GOING TO INCREASE OUR COSTS AND

05:12:44.212 --> 05:12:46.214
PREMIUMS AND OVERALL HEALTH

05:12:46.280 --> 05:12:50.017
CARE COSTS MUCH MORE. THAN ONE

05:12:50.084 --> 05:12:53.354
DOLLAR INCREASE IN SOCIALIZING

05:12:53.421 --> 05:12:55.890
THE COST OF THE MEDICINE. TRIP

05:12:55.957 --> 05:12:58.559
TO ME IT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE

05:12:58.626 --> 05:13:00.461
MATHEMATICAL EQUATION THAT

05:13:00.528 --> 05:13:02.830
MAKES SENSE I KNOW IT DOES TO

05:13:02.897 --> 05:13:04.899

05:13:04.966 --> 05:13:07.301

05:28:31.291 --> 05:28:32.325
SOMETHING THAT'S KNOWN AS

05:28:32.392 --> 05:28:35.128
PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION CARE.

05:28:35.195 --> 05:28:36.863
IN EMERGENCY SETTINGS AND WE

05:28:36.930 --> 05:28:38.532
KNOW THAT IF WE DO THIS WE CAN

05:28:38.598 --> 05:28:41.435
STABILIZE UP 280% OF PATIENTS

05:28:41.501 --> 05:28:42.369

EMERGENCIES IN LESS THAN TWENTY

05:28:44.538 --> 05:28:45.906
FOUR HOURS. WE CAN PROBABLY

05:28:45.972 --> 05:28:48.375
HELP THESE FOLKS FOR A FRACTION

05:28:48.442 --> 05:28:49.910
OF THE COST OF WHAT IN PATIENT

05:28:49.976 --> 05:28:51.678
CARE AREAS. AND THEN THAT'S

05:28:51.745 --> 05:28:53.080
GOING TO SAVE THOSE PRECIOUS

05:28:53.146 --> 05:28:55.348

05:28:55.415 --> 05:28:57.184
WHO TRULY HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE.

05:28:57.250 --> 05:28:58.785
SO PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION

05:28:58.852 --> 05:29:00.454

05:29:00.520 --> 05:29:02.289

05:29:07.094 --> 05:29:09.029
MOVING PATIENTS QUICKLY OUT OF

05:29:19.506 --> 05:29:21.942
COLLABORATIVE AND NON COERCIVE

05:29:22.008 --> 05:29:23.877
THERE'S CLOSE TO ZERO USE OF
