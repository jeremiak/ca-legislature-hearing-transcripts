CENTER NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES ON THE SENATE- I DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR OBJECTIONS BUT I AM GOING TO HAVE STATE. AND THE REASON BEING THIS DOES UNDERMINE PARENTAL AUTHORITY. AND I'VE SEEN A LOT MORE OF THAT THAN ANYBODY AROUND HERE BY YEARS THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS CRIMINALS LIVES. THE BROKEN HEART. THAT MAY HAVE STARTED IN THE WOMB. AND THEN DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAT THEY RESORT. TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT BROKEN HEART. WE DEAL WITH THEM IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU BET THERE ARE A LOT OF IRRESPONSIBLE. BAD PARENTS. AND WE SHOULD CONDEMN. BUT HERE. THE BROADNESS OF IT CONCERNS ME. THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW SOME ABUSE OF THAT. AND YET ANOTHER OF THIS LEGISLATURE IS UNDERMINING. OF PARENTAL AUTHORITY. AND RESPONSIBILITY I DO NOT- JIM NOBLE. BUT I WILL ABSTAIN. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE CENTER CALM WATER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I- AGREE THAT THE DEFINITION IS OVERLY BROAD AND SO THE ATTEMPT OF THIS BILL IS TO MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED IT OBVIOUSLY- AND IT STILL KEEPS IN CODE WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL NEGLECT FAILURE TO TAKE CARE OF A CHILD TO PROVIDE FOR A CHILD. BUT CURRENTLY SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ABLE TO SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND PLACE THEM IN FOSTER CARE BECAUSE ON ONE PARTICULAR DAY THEY MAY HAVE A BROKEN REFRIGERATOR OR NOT ENOUGH FOOD AND SO THIS SAYS LET'S HAVE SOCIAL WORKERS MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION CONNECT THEM WITH RESOURCES BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE CERTAINLY DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED. BUT IN TEMPORARY INSTANCES OF POVERTY OUT WE'D LIKE FOLKS TO GET RESOURCES RATHER THAN HAVE FAMILY SEPARATIONS HAPPEN AND HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN STAY IN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER CALM WATER MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
