I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY IS HERE LIKE TO WELCOME HIM TO COMMENT PRESENT ITEM NUMBER TWO ASSEMBLY BILL. FOR TWENTY THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS. OF I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT A BEFORE -- TWENTY I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING SO DILIGENTLY WITH THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY ASPECT OF THIS BILL. WORKS FOR THE CENTER AND FOR CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TAKEN A FEW MOMENTS BUT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL. REMAINS THE SAME TO GIVE AUTHORIZATION TO THE CENTER OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH. TO CONTINUE PERFORMING NECESSARY RESEARCH ON THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS. APPEAR CANNABINOIDS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPOUNDS. IT ALSO BROADENS THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH AVAILABLE TO CMC ARE. AND WOULD ALLOW THEM TO THE ABILITY TO CULTIVATE THEIR OWN CANNABIS. IT'S CRITICAL TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CURRENT CODE TO ALLOW FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE STUDIES IF WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. THIS NEW AND INNOVATIVE FIELD OF RESEARCH FOR OUR STATE. THIS BILL PRESENTS RESEARCHERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH BENEFITS. THAT CAN BE GAINED FROM THIS PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. DOCTOR TOM MARK ON HIS CO DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO IS GOING TO SHARE SOME MORE ABOUT THE RESEARCH YOU NEED FOR THE BILL [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] SO. SO JUST VERY QUICKLY BY BY WAY OF BACKGROUNDTO THE C. M. C. R. WAS ESTABLISHED IN. TWO THOUSAND WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE COMPASSIONATE USE ACT -- CENTER VASCONCELOS SPONSORED A BILL TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE. OF RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC DATA REGARDING CANNABIS AS POSSIBLE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE A FAX. DURING THAT ERA WE GOT SOME FUNDING TO AND DID SEVEN CLINICAL TRIALS THE FIRST CLINICAL TRIALS IN TWENTY YEARS THE SMOKE OUT OF US -- AT ALL OF THEM SHOWED POSITIVE RESULTS IN VERY SHORT. TERM STUDIES BUT IN THE SUBSEQUENT TWENTY YEARS A LOT HAS HAPPENED WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT CANNABINOIDS INTO CANNABINOIDS THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL -- BUT WE CAN'T STUDY MOST OF THOSE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS IMITATIONS AND APART WE ONLY GET. OUR PLANT MATERIAL FROM BAIDOA. US THE ONLY SOURCE AND ONE OF THE THE GOALS OF THIS IS ULTIMATELY SPECIALLY WITH FEDERAL WHEN FEDERAL APPROVALS COME THROUGH THAT WE CAN WORK WITH EITHER INDUSTRY ARE WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES. TO DEVELOPED CANNABIS PLANTS THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST MEDICINALLY. OFFER VARIOUS CONDITIONS. ANOTHER LIMITATION THAT WE FACE IS THAT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE SOURCES OF KIND OF CANNABINOIDS -- IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT CERTAIN CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A STUDY GOING TO LOOK AT AUTISM. BUT WE HAVE TO GO TO A SPECIFIC SOURCE TO FIND CBT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TÁEEN AS A TNC IS THE PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENT. OBVIOUSLY WE DO NOT WANT TO GET KIDS STONED AND HIGH -- SO THIS ALSO ENABLES US TO BE LOOKING AT THESE SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY AND DOING CLINICAL STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW CANNABIS AND ITS CONSTITUENTS MIGHT AFFECT. OUR PERFORMANCE. AND THEN I'LL JUST ALSO THROW IN THAT -- WE DO STUDY ALSO LOOK AT PUBLIC SAFETY I DO DRIVING RESEARCH AND SO FORTH IMPACT OF OF CANNABIS -- AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE LIMITED BY BEING ABLE TO ACCESS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN. THE CANVAS THIS BEING DISTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC -- AND THIS WILL ENABLE US ALSO TO ALTERNATELY LOOK AT THOSE MATERIALS AS WELL. AGAIN ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ALEX TOURISM ME OF EASE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FRANCO THE CALIFORNIA CANNERS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANKS THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. I DON'T SEE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SOARING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. FOUR EIGHT I DO I RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUE SAYS. SOMETHING OVER THERE IS A SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS -- IN A ANALYSIS ARE YOU TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AND ARE YOU WILLING TO SUPPORT THAT YES WE ARE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU RECOGNIZE SENATOR PAT. I THANK YOU AND SUMMER LIKE DOCUMENT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE I THINK WHEN THE MOST FRUSTRATING ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO CANNABIS AND RELATED -- THE ISSUE. WELL I THINK TERMS A MEDICINAL CANNABIS IS ACTUALLY LACK OF INFORMATION SO AS A PHYSICIAN. I SEE. NUMEROUS CLAIMS BEING MADE ABOUT CANNABIS SOME THE MORE QUESTIONABLE I'VE ALSO SEEN NUMEROUS CLAIMS INTO BOTH IN TERMS OF ITS BENEFITS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF ITS DANGERS. AND I THINK ULTIMATELY WE NEED ACTOR INFORMATION ACTUALLY MANY OF THE TREATMENTS POSITIONS EMPLOYEE -- WE CAN TALK ABOUT RATE OF WILL AIDS. TO AT THE OUR VARIOUS OF LIGHT OTHER THINGS HAVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS RIGHT AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEM SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO BENEFIT PATIENTS AND HOW TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC AND ALSO PROTECT THEM FROM. THE DANGERS THAT MIGHT BE ASSOCIATES WELL STRIKE THAT RIGHT BALANCE. AND SO TO HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO I APPRECIATE WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO. I GUESS ONE THE QUESTIONS I HAVE MAYBE -- FOR THE START BY GETTING YOUR NAME RIGHT NOW MORE CONTACT OUR MARKET YES IS IS THAT -- SO UNDER THIS BILL I MEAN WE HAVE FUNDING WE PROVIDE FOR CANNABIS RESEARCH ARE WE STE DOLE CONSTRAINED BY THE FEDERAL RULES OF WE USE ONLY STATE OR PRIVATE FUNDS. IN TERMS OF THE THEN SO OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO HAVE. YOU KNOW -- OF A BILL APPROPRIATE SAMPLE OUR OUR TRIO THAT SUBSTANCES FOR AND THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY POTENCY AND PURITY AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO CONDUCT YOUR RESEARCH ARE YOU STILL IF YOU'RE NOT USING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THAT RESEARCH ARE YOU STILL CONSTRAINED -- BY SOME OF THE FEDERAL RULES VEAL CONDUCT THE THE RESEARCH THAT YOU NEED TO DO -- SO CURRENTLY WE ARE AND PART OF IT IS IS SORT OF MAYBE PROBABLY A SUBURB OF PEOPLE BEING RISK AVERSE TO THE THINGS ARE DECADE OF THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN -- SHOULD WE USE CANNABIS THAT THAT COMES FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO POSITION OURSELVES READY TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT AS THINGS START TO LOOSEN UP AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I KNOW THERE A LOT OF BILLS CURRENTLY MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH. THE TO GIVE MORE FREEDOM TO THE STATES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. RIGHT NOW -- WE HAVE TO GET OUR OUR CANNABIS FROM NIGHT A IS IT A SIMPLE CHOICE SO JUST TO CLARIFY AND I'VE BEEN AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE WITH THIS BILL IF THIS BILL IS PASSED AND BECOMES LAW [inaudible] WELL THAT. ARE YOU WOULD YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR FEDERAL ACTIONS FOR YOU. TO DO TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF RESEARCH THAT YOU NEED TO DO OUR WILL THIS BILL IN ITSELF ALLOW YOU TO DO MORE THAN YOU'RE ABLE TO DO NOW. I SUSPECT WE STILL NEED SOME FEDERAL ACTION SO RIGHT NOW IT'S WRITTEN INTO THE BILL THAT WE STILL WILL FOLLOW THE D. E. A. GUIDELINES -- BUT AGAIN IT DOES POSITION US WELL I THINK -- FOR WHEN THOSE THIS ENOUGH OR YOU KNOW I I'M NOT A LEGISLATURE AND I'M ALSO NOT PART OF THE UC SYSTEM A WRITER INSURANCE SHERMAN. DEPEND ON HOW MUCH THEY ARE OR WILLING -- TO DAY SORT OF TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS I CAN JUST ADD SOMETHING WHAT WHAT THEY'RE WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IT AND ONE OF THE MAIN FUNCTIONS BILLS TO SHOW THE PRIORITIZATION. AND POINT OUT THE PROBLEM IN THE DISPARITY THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING BECAUSE WERE WE'VE GOT THE RESEARCH WE'VE GOT THE ABILITY -- AND AND WE HAVE THE THE MECHANISM IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY WHAT NEEDS TO BE IDENTIFIED BUT WE HAVE. THIS REALLY OLD STANDARD THAT LIMITS US TO THE POTENCY OF SEVENTIES WE'D AS OPPOSED. TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING USED TODAY AND SO THAT AS A IT'S RIDICULOUS. WELL FIRST OF ALL I AM FAVOR YOUR BILL -- BUT WHY I'M ALSO TRYING TO GET AT I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT. YEAH I SAID YEAH OBVIOUSLY DE A RULES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PROTECTING PEOPLE PATIENTS WE WANT TO KEEP BUT IF THE ONES THAT. BASICALLY JUST STOPPING YOU FROM DOING THE RESEARCH. SO WE NEED TO HAVE ALL THE YEAH WE HAVE ALL THE ARBY'S ALL THAT OTHER STUFF THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT -- BUT I'M ALSO TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU AT EIGHTEEN TO BUILD AYE AYE I AM I AM TO ME ABOUT HOW DO WE NEED TO GET THAT INFORMATION WE NEED TO HAVE MORE ACCURATE FORMATION SO PEOPLE CAN -- HAVE AND SO THAT AND YOU TALKED ABOUT VERY SHORT TERM STAYS WE NEED LONG TERM STUDIES RIGHT AND SO FORTH SO -- I'M JUST PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS REALLY ABOUT HOW CAN CALIFORNIA LEAD. YOU KNOW WE'VE NOW THE PEOPLE CALPERS SPOKE THEY'VE YELL LEGALIZED THE AREA OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCURATE FORMATION. IF YOU'RE USING A MEDICINALLY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE BENEFITS AND THE THAT THE RISKS ARE HOW TO BEST STRICT AS THE RIGHT BALANCE WE POSITIONS NEED AFFIRMATION OTHER HEALTH PROVIDERS. SO I'M HOPING WE CAN -- WITH THIS BILL THAT ALSO THINK ABOUT OTHER ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TO TRY TO MOVE THAT FORWARD IN A WAY THAT WILL BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL DESPITE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. NOT I RECOGNIZE SENATOR PANS MOTION. AS AMENDED THE FOR THE BILL AS AMENDED SENATOR.

LEAD TO STUDENT ATHLETES. SO ARE WITH ME HERE WE HAVE A CHEN AT LOW PATH FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING MRCHAIRMAN MEMBERS JANET LOPEZ REPRESENT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] WHAT? GOOD AFTERNOON ALEX CRAZY ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN SUPPORT THANKS THANK YOU. ENTER MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. LAST CHANCE I WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR ARCHULETA. THE THANK YOU A MEMBER FOR COMING BEFORE US -- I HAVE A SON. WHO HAS A SON MY GRANDSON WHO IS ABOUT TO ENTER INTO COLLEGE AND -- HE'S IN THAT LEVEL ONE COMPETITIVE EDGE AND SO THIS BROUGHT A LOT OF ATTENTION TO MAKE IT HE'S ON HIS WAY -- WITHOUT NAMING THE UNIVERSITY BUT HE HOPES TO BE THE QUARTERBACK ONE DAY. BUT MY CONCERN IS -- THE COST FEES AND EXPENSES THAT MIGHT BE SWIRLING AROUND SOME SORT OF ASSOCIATION WITH A MANAGER OR OR AN AGENT OF SOME SORT OF THING. SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW. THESE KIDS MIGHT GET CAUGHT INTO A CONTRACT THAT. THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF IF IN FACT THEY DO NOT GET PICKED UP IN THEIR HANDED A BILL UPON GRADUATION. HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THAT IS THAT AN ISSUE. THAT -- DEFINITELY THE DAILY YOU WANTED. TO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL. I'M SENATOR WE ACTUALLY PUT A PROVISION YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE ROUND DANA MITCHELL I'M THE STAFFER FOR MISTER. TO WE PUT A PROVISION IN THE MOST RECENT ROUND OF AMENDMENTS THAT MAKES THE CONTRACTS TERMINATE BY THEIR OWN TERMS -- IF THEY DON'T -- ELECT TO GO PROFESSIONAL AND AND RETURN BACK TO THEIR SCHOOLS SO THAT WILL BY. DEFINITION -- WILL CUT IT OFF RIGHT THERE FORM SO. SO THERE THERE WON'T BE ANY -- FEES COSTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MEMBERSHIP OR OWNERSHIP. FOR A PARTNERSHIP THAT WILL CALL IT WATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND THEN AT THE END DOESN'T WORK. THE STUDENT RETURNS TO SCHOOL AND HE'S NOT STUCK WITH THE BILL OF SOME SORT. OKAY GOOD THAT WAS MY WORRY THANK YOU VERY GOOD CENTER ISOLATING GRADUATION SIGN YOUR BUDDING GRANDSONS ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENTS SO. SENATOR DODD. YES BUT CENTER ARE TO LET I WOULD AT LEAST EIGHT DOLLARS TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW THE THOUGHT SO HIGHLY OF YOUR RED SAID -- TO IN TYSON THAT UNIVERSITY BUT I I'VE A LOT SO I I MIGHT IF THAT THE CHAIRS I BETTER NOT. NEVER THE LESS -- I'M INTERESTED -- MAYBE A DUMB QUESTION I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M JUST INTERESTED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFONIA. OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE HAD A NUMBER OF ATHLETES WILL QUALIFY FOR THIS OVER THE YEARS IN MANY SPORTS. TELL ME WHAT -- YOUR INTEREST IS IN SEEING THIS TYPE OF POLICY -- PREVAIL. SO WE ARE ALWAYS SUPPORTIVE OF STATE LEGISLATION THAT WILL -- IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY OUR ORGANIZATION NATIONAL THE NC DOUBLE A AND THIS WOULD REALLY PUT -- STATE LAW IT CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE LARGER MEMBERSHIP -- THE NC DOUBLE A HAS THIS IS A PART PART OF THEIR THIS IS. PART OF THE NC DOUBLE A RULES RIGHT NOW WE'RE THE INSIDE WITH A AN AGENT WHILE THEY'RE STILL PLAY AS DANA MENTIONED IT'S A RECENTLY ADOPTED. YEAH SO WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN STATE LAW WITH THE RECENTLY RULE CHANGES ADOPTED BY THE NC DOUBLE A MOVE THE BILL OF NOBODY ELSE HAS. YET I HAVE SENATOR PAN AND THEN WE'LL GET TO THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THE I. APPRECIATE -- THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ALIGN WITH NC DOUBLE A ALTHOUGH I WILL POINT OUT I MY CONFIDENCE IN NC DOUBLE A ITSELF IS NOT THAT GREAT AT THE MOMENT -- AS I UNDERSTAND THIS ONLY APPLIES. TO MALE ELITE ATHLETES BASKETBALL [inaudible] IN BASKETBALL. AND SO WIDE BY NO YOU'RE NOT NC DOUBLE A BUT I MEAN IT'S SO THERE YOU KNOW OF A ONE AND DONE RULE WHERE YOU HAD TO PLAY ONE YEAR OF COLLEGE AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE RECRUITED AND THERE WAS A GROUP OF FOLKS THAT WOULD. GO COMMIT THEMSELVES -- TO TO BE RECRUITED AND THEY'D SHOW UP AT THE COMBINE AND THEY WOULD HIRE AGENTS AS THEY WOULD HAVE TO IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T GET DRAFTED. AND SO THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR ELIGIBILITY BUT THEY COULDN'T COME TO THE COULDN'T COMEBACK SCHOOL AND THEY DIDN'T GET DRAFTED AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS UNFAIR. AND THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET -- FOR THIS VERY ELITE CADRE OF BASKETBALL PLAYERS -- DEBILITY TO COME TO THE COMBINE TO TO TRY OUT -- IN ORDER TO DO SO YOU NEED TO BE DECLARED A LEAD BY THE THE NBA COMMITTEE SO -- LIKELY HAS THIS QUESTION THAT -- SO THE NC DOUBLE A HAS MADE THIS RULE CHANGE FOR A VERY NARROW GROUP OF ATHLETES -- IS. SO WHEN -- I GUESS ARE THE UNIVERSITIES IN FAVOR OF AND YOU SAID I HEARD WERE PILOT. ARE THEY IN FAVOR THIS POLICY BEING APPLIED MORE GENERALLY EVENTUALLY TO ALL ATHLETES. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE REASON THAT IT'SHAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN BASKETBALL IS DRIVEN BY THE NBA'S ROLES ON RECRUITMENT WHICH IS HOW COME I STARTED WITH THE ONE AND ROLE -- THE THE RECRUITMENT INTO THE PROFESSIONAL RANKS IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN BY THE PROFESSIONALRANKS AND SO -- FOR INSTANCE BASEBALL PLAYERS ARE ALLOWED TO BE RECRUITED -- BECAUSE THE THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SYSTEM HAS THE FARM TEAMS -- THEY ALREADY ARE ALLOWED UNDER THE EXISTING INTO DOUBLE A RULES TO HAVE AGENTS AND TO TO BE PART OF THAT -- THE NBA IS -- RATHER UNIQUE IN THAT THEY ALSO -- THEY HAVE THIS RULE -- THE W. A. B. A. ALSO HAS A A RULE SO THEY ARE CONSIDERING EXPANDING IT RIGHT NOW TO THE W. NBA AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SPORTS WHERE THE PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FOLK. ARE ALLOWING -- COLLEGIATE ATHLETES TO TO JOIN THE RANKS WERE TO JUMP FROM HIGH SCHOOL STREET IN LIKE THE NBA'S DOES ALLOW PEOPLE. SO THAT'S THE THE THE GENESIS OF AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO NARROW IS. LIKE I SAID IT'S DRIVEN BY THE THE NBA'S OR DO YOU THINK THIS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS. YES OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE. TO RETURN TO THEIR INSTITUTIONS WERE THEY NOT DRAFTED. OKAY SO SO THEN IF THIS IS THE BEST AND I REALIZE SOMEONE'S HAS TO DO WITH THAT. BUT OTHER PROFESSIONAL. THE X. DO IT BUT THEN THEN YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF DOING THIS MORE BROADLY. FOR YES SIR AND THE LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN A WAY TO NOT EXPRESSLY CONFORM TO ONLY THIS ONE RULE CHANGE BUT WE RODE IT SO THAT WE COULD ALLOW AS THE NC DOUBLE A EXPANDS. THEIR PROGRAM THE LAW IS NOT GOING TO HAVE TO BE REVISITED EACH TIME YOU ADAM BOARD AND I'VE LET ME ASK -- POLLUTANTS FROM. USC SO NC DOUBLE A IS. GOVERNED BY UNIVERSITIES CORRECT YES [inaudible] SERVICE. HUNDRED MEMBERS RIGHT NOW MORE OKAY BECAUSE YOU'RE MINE SO IS THERE A COMMITMENT FROM USC AND PERHAPS I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TO ONE IS HERE SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY FAIR FOR YOU ALONE BUT TO ACTUALLY A PUSH FOR THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES AT NC DOUBLE A AFTER ALL YOU ARE. THE GROUP YOU ARE RUN BY UNIVERSITIES I I IF I JUST AND I I SIGNED A FEEL THAT THE UNIVERSITY THEMSELVES. ARE NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH ADVOCATES FOR THEIR OWN STUDENTS AND SINCE THE S. INTERESTING YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT YOU ACTUALLY RUN. SO CAN WE SEE BROADER CHANGES THE NC DOUBLE A WITH -- THAT WHERE YOU'RE NOT JUST USC BUT OTHER CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES STANDING TOGETHER SAYING WE DEMAND CHANGES AT U. S. IN NC DOUBLE A FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR STUDENTS. KNOW ABSOLUTELY CENTER I KNOW YOU **** THAT QUESTION WHEN WE ARE IN SENATE EDUCATION. AND SO I KNOW OUR TIME HERE IS IN FOCUSED ON THE LARGER DISCUSSION WITH INTO DOUBLING GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT. WE ARE -- ADVOCATING FOR REFORMS ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENT ATHLETES REGULARLY YET I THOUGHT I GUESS SO YEAH I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT. I DON'T WANT TO JUST DO BILLS CONFORM WITH THE NC DOUBLE A I WANT US TO THINK HERE ART IN THIS LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR STUDENTS. AND NOT JUST DO THINGS BECAUSE AND TWO OF THEM EXCHANGED WORDS CAN CONFORM TO THAT. ANDERSON YEAH OKAY. RIGHT THANK YOU YEAH ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THAT ARCHULETA SIGNATURE. I WAS IN THE IMPRESSION THAT PERHAPS SOME OF THIS WORD THAT THISINCLUDED WOMEN AS WELL. AND I WAS ALSO THE IMPRESSION IT INCLUDED ALL SPORTS AS WELL. SO I SEE THAT ALL SPORTS ARE LEFT OUT AND CERTAINLY WOMEN ARE BEING DISCRIMINATED BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PROFESSIONAL LEAGUE -- AND THEY TOO ARE RECRUITED. SHOW I I SEE THAT THERE ARE YOU LEADING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT'S WHY YOU CALL IN A PILOT PROGRAM I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT IT DOWN. BECAUSE I WANT TO SAY THIS IS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WOMEN. BUT IF IT'S A DOOR OPENER FOR THE FUTURE AND THAT'S WHY THE PILOT THEN I CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. WOULD YOU COMMENT PLEASE. YOUR DOCTOR DEFINITELY RIGHT THIS IS -- WE'RE TRYING TO JUST CONFORM WAS. TO AND SEE DOUBLE THE RULES AND RIGHT NOW DO YOU ONLY ADDRESSING THE MALE BASKETBALL AFFLECK. YOU KNOW AND AND TO NC DOUBLE A RUSE. THE IS REALLY DRIVEN BY THE HUNDRED WHAT TWENTIES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. IN A SHOW WORK WERE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CONFORM WITH A AND C. W. YOU HAVE ANYTHING. TO IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE EXAMINING THE EXTENSION TO THE WOMEN UNDER THE W. A. B. AS WELL BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THE SAME CONTRACT. SO THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION YES SIR. AND ALONG THIS PATH WITH THESE -- STUDENT ATHLETES BE RECEIVING FUNDING MONIES -- PAYCHECKS BY ANYWAYS. FORM IN ADVANCE OF THEIR FUTURISTIC PLAY. YEAH THIS BILL ALLOWS THEM TO HIRE AGENTS AND ALLOWS THE AGENTS TO EXPEND MONEY -- IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS IT'S VERY NARROW IT IT DOESN'T GET INTO THE CONTRACTS THAT THE AGENTS WILL THEN SIGN ON THE HALF OF THE STUDENT ATHLETES AND THIS DOES NOT -- ALLOW THE STUDENT ATHLETES TO BECOME PROFESSIONALS AS THEY MAINTAIN THEIR AMATEUR STATUS SO IF THE START GETTING PAID. TO PERFORM ATHLETICALLY -- THAT'S ANOTHER BILL. AND AND AND THAT IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL THIS BILL MERELY ALLOWS THEM. TO OBTAIN THE SERVICE AGENTS AND IT ALLOWS THE AGENTS TO EXPAND TO MINIMUS AMOUNTS TRAVEL PART OF THE THE ENTICEMENT TO SIGN WITH THE AGENCY. FOOD -- ASSOCIATED WITH -- WITH THE CONTRACT SOLICITATIONS SO IT'S IT'S NOT EXACTLY -- WITHIN THE THE SCOPE OF US TO TO TALK ABOUT THE THE PROFESSIONALISM. GOOD THANK YOU.

IT WOULD CHANGE THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE WHO PROVISION.

WERE PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN EDUCATIONAL AND CLINICAL SETTINGS. AB. SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL ALLOW LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL pUP TO A MAXIMUM. OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED HOURS WHILE THEY PROVIDE SERVICES TO SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. TOWARDS LICENSOR. THIS IS OUT OF THE TOTAL OF THREE THOUSAND HOURS REQUIRED. WOULD ALSO ALLOW.

AMENDMENTS TAKEN PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON WHAT KIND OF SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUPERVISED BY A LICENSED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGISTS. AND PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND ADD THE DEFINITION OF SUPERVISOR IN CODE PROVISIONS RELATED TO MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS.

IF YOU THINK YOU ARE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA FOR OFFERING THIS BILL. AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME OF OTHER COMMITTEE HERE. ON CURRENTLY THE REGULATIONS NOT ALLOW ELLIE PEAS AS MYSELF LICENSE EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST -- TO PROVIDE SUPERVISION TO OTHER BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES ASSOCIATES -- OR PROFESSIONALS GAINING HOURS TOWARDS THEIR LICENSURE ON MANY OF THESE BBS ASSOCIATES ARE EMPLOYED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ON PROVIDING EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH IS THE EXPERTISE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT NEED TO EMPLOY OTHER BBS LICENSING IS TO PROVIDE SUPERVISION FOR THE ASSOCIATES EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS THEY RELATE TO EDUCATIONAL. FUNCTION. IN ONE INSTANCE TO B. B. S. ASSOCIATES WERE PROVIDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS IN A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN ALLEY P. -- THEY BELIEVE THEIR HOURS WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THEIR LICENSURE -- BUT THEY WERE DENIED THE ENTIRE YEARS WORK WHICH WAS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED HOURS -- BECAUSE THE SUPERVISION WAS PROVIDED FINALLY P.. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THIS AND ALLOW THE PEACE TO PROVIDE SUPERVISION TO OTHER BBS ASSOCIATES WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICES WITHIN OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE IN EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BBS ASSOCIATES TO WORK TOWARDS THEIR THEIR RELATED HOURS -- NEED HOURS FOR LICENSURE WITH SUPERVISION PROVIDED BY PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EXPERTS IN EDUCATION RELATED.
