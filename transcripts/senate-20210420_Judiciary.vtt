AVOID SCRUTINY OR BACKLASH.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.213
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE RECENT

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.948
FIRING AT GINA CARANO FROM

OPINIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HER

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.654
OPINIONS APPARENTLY DID NOT

00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:37.556
ALIGN WITH DISNEY'S. BECAUSE

BARE FOR US FOR US ALL TO SEE.

ENTIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

AMAZON WEB SERVICES ALL STAR

SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FROM A

DECADE AGO CAN COME BACK. AND

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.818
RUIN A PERSON'S CAREER. AS

LEGISLATORS WE ARE CHARGED TO

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:08.521
REPRESENT ALL OF OUR

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.689
CONSTITUENTS NOT JUST THE ONES

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:13.459
WITH WHOM WE AGREE. SB TWO

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.160
THIRTY EIGHT MAKES IT CLEAR

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:16.095
THAT WE AS AN ELECTED BODY IN

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.863
THE STATE. TELL YOU THE

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.465
OPINIONS OF OTHERS EVEN THOUGH

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.167
WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH THEM AND

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:22.234
ENSURES THAT POLITICAL

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.503
AFFILIATION IS NOT USED AS A

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.772
DISQUALIFIER FOR JOB. WHETHER

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.707
THAT JOBS AT A STARBUCKS FOR

CRITICAL IT OR DISNEYLAND. IT

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.611
ALSO ENSURES THAT EMPLOYEES

WITH NOTORIETY LIKE AMANDA I AM

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:35.648

THE MAKE UP COMPANY SEPHORA

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.185
PROPOSED IN SOCIAL MEDIA. AND

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.719
THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN CAN

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.788
HAVE THEIR PERSONAL VOICE

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.490
WITHOUT BEING SHAMED OR WITHOUT

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:47.893
FEAR OF RETALIATION BECAUSE IT

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.527
MAY DIFFER FROM THEIR EMPLOYER.

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:49.728
THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:51.497
PROTECT THE PERSONAL IDEAS AND

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.332
BELIEFS WE EACH HAVE FROM BEING

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.067
USED AS A LITMUS TEST BEFORE

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.203
RECEIVING A JOB OFFER. IN A

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.571
COUNTRY THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.072
THE FREE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AND

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.241
EXPRESSION. IT IS CONCERNING

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.642
THAT POLITICAL LEADERS

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:05.411
CORPORATIONS AND SOCIAL MEDIA

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:07.079
GIANTS WOULD SEEK TO SILENCE

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:09.648
THAT OPPRESSION. SIMPLY BECAUSE

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.216
THEY DON'T AGREE WITH IT OR

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:12.051
THEY DON'T LIKE IT. THE FIRST

00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:13.018

LEVEL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.257
ASSOCIATION. THIS RATE WILL BE

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:19.592
RAISED IF WE ALLOW THE CURRENT

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.393
PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATION ON

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.796

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:36.727
AHEAD. IT IS OUR OPINION THAT

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:39.029
IN THE ABSENCE OF A LEGITIMATE

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:40.998
BUSINESS INTEREST JUSTIFYING A

00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:43.601
DISTINCTION. ON THE BASIS OF

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.502
POLITICAL BELIEF OR AFFILIATION

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:47.037
THE OWNER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:48.539
PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON THE

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:50.241
BASIS OF POLITICAL BELIEFS OR

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:52.810
AFFILIATIONS. SO I HAVE A KIND

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:56.113
OF ZONE IN ON THE ABSENCE OF A

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.116
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTEREST.

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.819
SO I DO BELIEVE THAT. THERE

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.854
HAVE BEEN FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:06.490
OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM THAT

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:07.224
HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:10.494
AGAINST- I DON'T NECESSARILY

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:12.730
FIND AT THAT ONE PARTY HAS A

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.164
SUPERIOR POSITION OVER THE

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:15.866
OTHER WHETHER BEYOND THE LEFT

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.968
CENTER OR THE RIGHT. I JUST

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.871
KNOW THAT. IT DEFIES LOGIC IT

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.374
DEFIES WHAT WE DEEM TO BE OUR

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.876
FIRST AMENDMENT. CONSTITUTIONAL

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:29.380

BEING PART OF AN ASSEMBLY AND

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:32.616
EXPRESSING THOSE SO LONG AS

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:35.686
IT'S NOT. HI INTERFERING WITH

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:39.323
THE WORK PLACE- BEEN IT SHOULD

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:40.658
HAVE NO BEARING ON AN

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:43.227
INDIVIDUAL'S CAPACITY TO BE

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:45.262
EMPLOYED OR TO BE HOUSED- IT

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:48.832
CETERA. BUT THAT CONCLUSION IF

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:52.803
I MAY. OFFER A REQUEST TO THE

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.638
AUTHOR THROUGH THE CHAIR. IS

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:56.040
THAT A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS

00:42:56.106 --> 00:42:57.274
INTERESTS JUSTIFYING A

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:58.842
DISTINCTION IS AN INTERESTING

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:01.745
CHOICE OF WORDS THAT LEDGE

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:04.048

EMPLOYER FORTY INDUSTRY- ENTITY.

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:19.530
CALCULATES OUT THAT IT WOULD

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:22.800
HURT THEIR BUSINESS INTEREST BY

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:25.169
ALLOWING EMPLOYEES WHO MAY BE

FACTION OR PARTY. IS IT YOUR

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.476
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT GIVES

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:37.181
RISE TO AN ALLOWANCE. M. NO IT

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.449

APTLY POINTED OUT. BUT IT

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:55.933
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.602
FOR EMPLOYER TO METE OUT WHO

00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:07.337
AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO DO

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:08.972

FACT THAT THERE. ACTIVITIES ARE

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.265
ANTITHETICAL TO THE

AFFILIATION. OFF THE TOP OF MY

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:04.374
HEAD IT SEEMS UNCLEAR BUT IF

THERE WAS KNOWN PROSPECTIVELY

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:08.144
YOU KNOW FOR THE EMPLOYER THAT

RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. I WOULD

00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:22.459
READ THE LAW TO SAY THAT THE

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:23.259
FOR THE EMPLOYER COULD

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:25.862
RATIONALLY CONCLUDE THAT THAT

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.464
WOULD NOT BE A GOOD CANDIDATE

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.133
FOR THAT JOB JUST BASED ON. HOW

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.401
DEDICATED THEY WOULD BE TO

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:33.737

MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION IS

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.040
TO PROMOTE ONE BECAUSE BUT- YOU

WERE INTERVIEWING A CANDIDATE

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:39.943
WHO BELIEVES IN THE OPPOSITE OF

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.977
THAT BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER COULD

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.545
RATIONALLY CONCLUDE THAT

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:43.480
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK VERY

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:45.615
HARD FOR ME OR THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:46.583
GOING TO WORK WELL WITH.

MEMBERS OF THE TEAM SO I THINK

00:54:47.817 --> 00:54:49.853
IN THAT SITUATION. THAT WOULD

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:53.390
BE A PERMISSIBLE. IT WOULD BE

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:54.491

ONE WHEN PETE WILSON WAS

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:29.911
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE

COLLEGE EVER THOUGHT THE TEST

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:33.014
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT. BUT

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.949
BUT THOSE OF YOU MAY REMEMBER

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:36.317
PETE WILSON WASN'T SO POPULAR

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:37.752
WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS BACK THEN

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:40.955
I WASN'T POLITICALLY ACTIVE-

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:42.723
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE- NOR

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.659
MOTIVATED BUT I DID APPRECIATE

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:48.663
THE- THE DIALOGUE OR THE DEBATE

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.731
OR CONTROVERSY OR- YOU KNOW

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:52.633
JUST WATCHING THE DIFFERENT

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.001
SIDES OF THE ISSUE AND THE

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.436
ISSUE BACK THEN WAS A PRETTY

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:59.006
SIMPLE ONE- P. WILSON- AND THE

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.942
LEGISLATURE WAS RAISING FEES AT

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:03.344
THE ON THE CSU SYSTEM- FAIRLY

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.079
DRAMATICALLY. AND ALLOW THE

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:06.814
STUDENTS DID APPRECIATE THAT I

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:09.116
THINK EVEN ONE DAY- AND I DON'T

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:10.785
THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THIS

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:12.219
BUT IT I BELIEVE IT'S PROTECTED

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.821
BY THE FIRST MINUTE THEY THEY

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:15.756
BURNT AN EFFIGY OF. PETE WILSON

01:33:15.823 --> 01:33:20.628
I THOUGHT THAT WAS- UNFORTUNATE.

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:25.800
BUT- THE DIALOGUE WAS IMPORTANT

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.335
AND THE DEBATE WAS IMPORTANT

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.836
AND I THINK THAT IT ADDED

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:30.571
CERTAINLY TO MY EXPERIENCE AS A

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:35.009

FOLKS THAT WERE ENGAGED ON THE

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:40.314
EITHER SIDE OF THE SHOULD

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:41.415
CERTAINLY WAS IMPORTANT FOR

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:42.283
THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:45.152

AMENDMENT. AND IS ADDS TO. THE

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.325

SPEECH ISSUES THANK YOU RIGHT

444-494-4249 EXCUSE ME. IS NOT

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.298
TWO THREE EIGHT THEY'RE TOTALLY

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:07.535
DIFFERENT PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:10.638
WITH- I THINK. DRAMATICALLY

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:14.442
DIFFERENT- CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:17.011
IN THE LAST BILL THERE WAS-

01:35:17.078 --> 01:35:19.313
SOME WORST CASE SCENARIOS THAT

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.448
WERE BROUGHT FORWARD I THINK IT

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:21.849
MEANS LESS SOME FOLKS A LITTLE

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:24.418
UNCOMFORTABLE- I WILL I

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.821
PARTICULARLY WASN'T BUT I THINK

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.923
SOME FOLKS MAY HAVE BEEN. BUT

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:29.423
TWO FOUR NINE IS TOTALLY

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:33.127
DIFFERENT. AND I'VE MENTIONED

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:37.598
THIS ON THE FOR MANY TIMES- I

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.533
TAUGHT FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND I

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.602
GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT.

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.571
THE MARKET PLACE OF IDEAS IN

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:47.508
SCHOOLS. SEEMS TO BE DEGRADED

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:50.411
AT LEAST TO ME. NOW I HAPPEN TO

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.780
GO TO VERY LIBERAL ARTS SCHOOLS

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:55.349
WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH MY

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.184
COLLEGE GRAD AND POST GRAD

01:35:57.251 --> 01:36:00.988
EXPERIENCE. BUT ESPECIALLY LAW

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:03.524
SCHOOL PROFESSORS WANT. YOU TO

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.594
ENGAGE ON ON ISSUES CAN TAKE

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.095
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES EVEN IF

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:09.997
YOU DISAGREED WITH THEM THEY

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:11.065
WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE THE

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:13.000
OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVE. AND

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:15.269
FASHION AN ARGUMENT EVEN THOUGH

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:15.870
YOU PERSONALLY DISAGREED WITH

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.938
THAT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:20.040
FANTASTIC TRAINING AND I THINK

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:22.510
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT HIGHLIGHTS

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:26.013
THE NEED FOR US TO FOSTER IN

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.083
OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT SENSE

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:32.153
THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE AND BE

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:32.853
EXPOSED TO THESE DIFFERENT

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.091
IDEAS. ARM AND NOT ALLOW FOR

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:40.094
THERE TO BE A PREVAILING WISDOM

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.630
CULTURE AND I THINK THAT IT HAS

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:44.565
CERTAINLY TAKEN ITS COURSE.

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:47.334
WHERE YOU MAY OF PHILLY- IN ONE

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:49.703
DIRECTION ON THE SPECTRUM OR

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.173
WHATEVER- WHATEVER PART OF THE

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:53.741
COUNTRY YOU MAY LIVE IN I THINK

01:36:53.807 --> 01:36:54.942
THAT IS DANGEROUS AND WE SHOULD

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:57.945
FIGHT THAT AT EVERY TURN.

01:36:58.012 --> 01:36:58.546
BECAUSE I WANT WHEN MY BOYS GO

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:00.681
TO SCHOOL. I WANT THEM TO BE

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:03.684
CHALLENGED. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.253
PART OF THE PREVAILING WISDOM.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.189
PROCESS WITHIN THEIR NOT GOING

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:09.857
TO BE CHALLENGED APPROPRIATELY

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:12.293
INTELLECTUALLY. AND I WANT THAT

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:15.062
TO HAPPEN. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:17.231
EVERY SCHOOL IS FOSTERING THAT

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.200
APPROACH AND I THINK WHAT THIS

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:22.069
DOES IS IT REINFORCES THAT THAT

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:24.238
THIS THAT SCHOOLS ARE PETRI

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:26.073
DISHES THEIR EXPERIMENTS OF

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.909
THOUGHT. THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:31.045
THE AMERICAN COLLEGE EXPERIENCE

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:32.813
WHICH MAKES IT THE GOLD

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.349
STANDARD AROUND THE GLOBE. AND

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:37.451
I THINK THAT OVER GENERATIONS

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.486
THAT HAS SUBSIDED SOMEWHAT AND

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:41.689
I DON'T LIKE IT. SO I THINK

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.624
WHAT THIS DOES IT REALLY

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:46.060
REAFFIRMS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:49.296
AFFILIATION FOR A MIND SET. ON

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:52.099
THAT YOU WERE GIVEN. A DEGREE

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.534
OF EQUAL PROTECTION IN THE

01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:54.902
EDUCATIONAL INTELLECTUAL

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:56.036
PROCESS AND I THINK THAT IS

01:37:56.103 --> 01:37:58.138
IMPORTANT BUT FOR THOSE OF OU

01:37:58.205 --> 01:38:00.107
WHO MIGHT STILL BE IN THE

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:01.542
MINDSET OF THE LAST BILL. WE

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:04.245
WERE DEALING WITH. THIS IS

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:04.812
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT ONCE

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:08.415
AGAIN. IT FURTHER SPECIFIES TWO

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:09.383
FOUR NINE DOES FURTHER

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.719
SPECIFIES THAT NO PERSON SHALL

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:14.088
BE SUBJECTED TO DISCRIMINATION

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:15.289
ON THE BASIS OF THEIR POLITICAL

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:18.192
IF IT FILIATION ANY PROGRAM OR

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:20.361
ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY AN

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:22.997
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. HATE

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.765
SPEECH AND HATE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:29.103
ARE NOT ALLOWED. IN IN- IN IN

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:31.238
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES YOU

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:32.406
MAY HAVE INDIVIDUALS AT A

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:33.741
SPELLS THOSE THINGS BUT

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:36.443
ORGANIZATIONALLY- THEY'RE NOT

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.511
TO BE PERMITTED TO THIS IS

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:39.280
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT I THINK

01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:40.481
THE CONCERNS THAT WE HEARD

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:42.283
BEFORE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:45.019
ASSUAGED BY THIS AND IF WE ARE

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:47.554
FUNDING STATE PROGRAMS I WANT

01:38:47.621 --> 01:38:48.155
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:50.291
CRITICAL THINKERS AND WE CAN'T

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:52.126
DO THAT. IF WE ALLOW

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:55.462
INTELLECTUAL INERTIA TO BE THE

01:38:55.529 --> 01:39:01.502
DOMINANT CULTURE OF COLLEGE.

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.237

ANYMORE DAN SCHOOLS ARE

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:16.076

01:40:17.878 --> 01:40:21.482

01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:23.751
NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS A CERTAIN

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:25.819
NUMBER OF LIBERTARIANS WE DON'T

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:26.653
REQUIRE THAT THIS IS NOT

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.189
REQUIRING POLITICAL NEUTRALITY

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:33.127
THIS IS REQUIRING- FAIRNESS AND

HOUSE ALL STUDENTS ARE TREATED

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:36.630
IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR-

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.732
POLITICAL IDEOLOGY OR BELIEFS I

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:42.302
WANT TO- COMMENT THOUGH ON

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:43.837
BECAUSE A LOT OF DISCUSSION HAS

01:40:43.904 --> 01:40:45.072
BEEN TAKING PLACE ABOUT THE

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:48.242
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- AND I YOU

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:50.711
KNOW I WILL TELL YOU. ARE I WAS

01:40:50.778 --> 01:40:52.846
A BIT TAKEN ABACK AT THE

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:55.949
EXTREME EXAMPLES THAT WERE

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:59.253
GIVEN IN THE ANALYSIS AND IT.

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:01.288
YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS A

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:02.756
TOPIC WORTHY OF DISCUSSION AYE.

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.892
AYE I JUST WAS CURIOUS AS TO

01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:07.194
WHY SUCH EXTREME EXAMPLES WERE

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.963
USED- TO DEBATE THIS VERY REAL

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:14.001
ISSUE AND- I. YOU KNOW I WILL

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:16.370
JUST TELL YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN-

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:19.406
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I FOUND I

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:21.708
THINK WE CAN DO COMMITTEE

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:25.446
ANALYSES WITHOUT- OUR SUCH

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:27.614
VULGARITIES EXPRESSED I DON'T

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:29.049
THINK THAT WAS NECESSARY I

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.651
THINK THAT WAS OVER THE TOP AS

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:32.719
A WOMAN I WAS OFFENDED I WAS

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:33.887
INSULTED I'M SURE THE FEMALE

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.322
MEMBERS OF MY STAFF. DIDN'T

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:37.424
APPRECIATE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE

01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:38.325
THAT WAS USED IN THE COMMITTEE

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:39.660
ANALYSIS I GET THAT HE WAS

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:41.295
TRYING TO MAKE THAT POINT. BE

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:42.362
THAT AS IT MAY I THOUGHT I

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:43.564
WOULD GO ON THE RECORD AND SAY

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.299
THAT BUT MR RIGHT COMES KEY TO

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:47.768
YOUR POINT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:50.103
POLITICAL NEUTRALITY AB GRADE

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:51.338
IF EVERYBODY WAS YOU KNOW A

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:52.573
LITTLE MORE OPEN MINDED IN

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:53.640
NATURE BUT THAT'S JUST NT

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:56.443
REALITY. WE CAN LEGISLATE THAT

01:41:56.510 --> 01:42:00.314
EVEN IF WE TRIED. ALL RIGHT I

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.249

COMMONLY REFERENCED ARGUMENT IS

02:00:19.245 --> 02:00:22.381
THAT IT WOULD RAISE THE COSTS.

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:25.051

INTENT OF THE FRAMERS ACTUALLY

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:44.170
DID NOT CONSIDER COST. AS A AS

02:00:44.236 --> 02:00:44.837
A METRIC OR BASIS FOR

AND IF YOU COULD SECURE THOSE.

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:02.188
IF OU COULD MEET THAT

02:01:02.254 --> 02:01:04.457
THRESHOLD IT WAS VIEWED AS

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:06.559
VALIDATION OF THE JSON

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:07.994
LEGITIMACY AND VALUE OF AN

EFFORT. AT NO TIME IN NINETEEN

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:12.932
TWELVE TODAY ANTICIPATE THE

02:01:12.999 --> 02:01:14.667
CHANGES WHICH WERE TO COME UP

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.769
AND IN PARTICULAR THE ABILITY

TO RAISE MONEY TO DO SO

02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:19.905
DIGITALLY- AND THEN TO HIRE

02:01:19.972 --> 02:01:22.008
SPECIALIZED FIRMS THAT. HAD

PERSONNEL IN THE CONDUCT OF

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:31.617
THESE EFFORTS. AND SO. THE

02:01:31.684 --> 02:01:33.019
INCENTIVES THAT THE SYSTEM

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:35.321
CREATES FAR CLEARLY DISTORT IF

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:36.822
I THINK ANYBODY WHO HAS

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:38.324
ENCOUNTERED A SIGNATURE GATHER

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:39.225

KIND OF THAT THE THREE CARD

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:45.231

VERY QUICK WAY PLEASE SIMPLY

02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:50.136
SON. AND THE REASON IT'S DONE

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:52.538
THAT WAY IS BECAUSE THE-

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:53.372
PRACTITIONERS GET PAID PER

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:56.042
SIGNATURE. AND THE BEST MOST

02:01:56.108 --> 02:01:57.910
EFFECTIVE WAY TO OPTIMIZE THEIR

02:01:57.977 --> 02:02:00.379
YIELD. IS TO TALK QUICKLY INTO

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.081
SAY WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR YOU

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:03.916

THAT YOU KNOW IT'S SOMEHOW THAT

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:11.157
THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND

02:02:11.223 --> 02:02:12.625
THEREFORE THE FAIREST WAY TO DO

02:02:12.692 --> 02:02:14.660
THIS. I WOULD ARGUE IS FLAWED

02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:17.296
AND I THINK IT'S PROOF OF THAT-

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:19.065
I WILL CITE. A PARTICULAR

02:02:19.131 --> 02:02:21.967

LEVEL. IT WILL HAVE A CHILLING

02:03:57.963 --> 02:04:00.499
EFFECT ON DIRECT DEMOCRACY AND

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:02.902
IF THE AUTHOR COULD. COMMENT ON

PATIENTS FAMILIES AND MORE. AND

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:08.740
THROUGHOUT THOSE HEARINGS WE

02:09:08.807 --> 02:09:09.708
DID FIND SOME THINGS THAT

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.243
NEEDED TO BE UPDATED AND

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:13.278

02:09:13.345 --> 02:09:14.913
YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S

02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:17.983
WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DO-

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:19.418
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BET

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:20.986
WAS CONSISTENTLY IN IN COMING

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:22.454
UP WAS THE ISSUE OF SOMETIMES

02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:24.089
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME BETWEEN

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:25.858
THAT INITIAL ASK. AND WHEN THE

02:09:25.924 --> 02:09:28.360

TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS TO

REQUEST THE AID IN DYING.

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:39.538
BEFORE IT DIES BEFORE

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:40.772
COMPLETING THE TIME CONSUMING

02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:42.541
PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES A

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.710
FIFTEEN DAY PERIOD- IN TWENTY

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:46.445
NINETEEN. OREGON THE STATE OF

OREGON WHICH HAS OVER TWENTY

YEARS OF HAVING THIS IN EFFECT.

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:50.883
AUTHORIZED A WAIVER OF THE

02:09:50.949 --> 02:09:51.650
FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:53.051
BETWEEN ORAL REQUEST TO ADDRESS

02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:55.554
THIS ISSUE- AND IN NEW MEXICO

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:57.356
ALSO JUST REDUCE THEIR WAITING

02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:59.191
PERIOD TO TWENTY EIGHT TO ADD

02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:00.893
FORTY EIGHT HOURS. AND THIS IS

02:10:00.959 --> 02:10:03.061
OFTENTIMES A REAL. MAKE THE ASK

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:04.530
TO THEIR INITIAL PHYSICIAN THE

02:10:04.596 --> 02:10:06.265
INITIAL ATTENDING PHYSICIAN

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:07.299
THINKING THAT PERSON IS GOING

02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:09.034
TO. PARTICIPATE THAT PERSON AND

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:10.469
SAYS NO THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRY

02:10:10.536 --> 02:10:12.004
TO FIND SOMEBODYELSE TO DO

02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:13.739
THAT INITIAL ACT OF. THAT

02:10:13.805 --> 02:10:15.174
SOMETIMES TAKES A WHILE AND

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:17.042
THEN TO WAIT AN ADDITIONAL

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.843
FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE THE FIND

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:19.778
SOMEBODY ELSE. TO BE ABLE TO

02:10:19.845 --> 02:10:21.847
WORK WITH. AND DURING THAT TIME

02:10:21.914 --> 02:10:23.882
BECAUSE THIS THIS BILL BACK TO

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:24.783
REQUIRES THE PERSON SELF

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:29.588
ADMINISTER. SOMETIMES THAT TIME

02:10:29.655 --> 02:10:30.189
THEY HAVE LOST THEIR BILLY TO

02:10:30.255 --> 02:10:31.056
SWALLOW. TO THEIR HAND TO

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:31.890
MOUTHS. WERE VARIETY OTHER

02:10:31.957 --> 02:10:33.592
THING I CAN PER. THEM FROM

02:10:33.659 --> 02:10:35.661
BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW.

02:10:35.727 --> 02:10:38.230
AS AS IT IS WRITTEN- SO WE

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:38.730
BELIEVE THAT FIFTEEN DAY

02:10:38.797 --> 02:10:40.699
WAITING PERIOD IF CAN CAN BE

02:10:40.766 --> 02:10:42.434
WAIVED. AND THAT IS WE'RE

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:44.236
SUGGESTING TO MOVE THAT TO

02:10:44.303 --> 02:10:46.038
FORTY EIGHT HOURS INSTEAD-

02:10:46.104 --> 02:10:47.306
THERE'S NO NEED FOR PEOPLE TO

02:10:47.372 --> 02:10:50.409
SUFFER- NEED LISTING DURING

02:10:50.475 --> 02:10:55.581
THAT TIME- ED. CURRENTLY

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:56.648
ANOTHER ISSUE AT THE END OF

02:10:56.715 --> 02:10:58.050
LIFE OPTION ACT IS THE

02:10:58.116 --> 02:11:00.719
PHYSICIAN NEEDS TO REMIND THEM

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:02.221
THE PERSON THAT THEY MAY NOT

02:11:02.287 --> 02:11:03.989
TAKE IT AT A PUBLIC SETTING

02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:05.057
SOMETIMES THIS PREVENTS

02:11:05.123 --> 02:11:06.558
CONFUSION FOR HOSPITALS OR

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:07.926
OTHER HEALTH PROVIDER FOR

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:09.228
BUSINESS BECAUSE NOT IT

02:11:09.294 --> 02:11:11.230
SHOULDN'T JUST BE OUTSIDE- BUT

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:12.364
CERTAINLY HEALTH CARE STANDARDS

02:11:12.431 --> 02:11:14.566
SETTING IS ALL RIGHT IF THAT

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:16.368
HEALTHCARE SETTING PARTICIPATES

02:11:16.435 --> 02:11:17.936
IN THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING

02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:20.472
NOTHING IN THIS CHANGE- SAYS

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:22.140
THAT THE OF A HEALTH CARE

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:23.775
FACILITY MUST PARTICIPATE BUT

02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:24.610
REDUCING THAT THE WITH THE

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:25.611
PHYSICIAN DOESN'T NEED TO

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:30.182
CONTINUE TO SAY THAT- AS- THIS

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:32.217
BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.986
DATE OF ALL ORAL AND WRITTEN

02:11:34.052 --> 02:11:35.854
REQUEST MUST BE DOCUMENTED.

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.522
ENSURING THAT TIME WE ASK

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:39.424
ACCESS SO THE PERSON PASSED

02:11:39.491 --> 02:11:40.826
OFTENTIMES MISADVENTURE THAT'S

02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:42.194
NOT DOCUMENTED SO THEN THERE

02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:43.228
BECOMES A QUESTION WHEN DID

02:11:43.295 --> 02:11:44.730
THAT FIFTEEN DAYS ACTUALLY

02:11:44.796 --> 02:11:46.765
START SO THIS SAYS A POSITION

02:11:46.832 --> 02:11:48.867
MUST DOCUMENT AT THAT TIME IF

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:49.701
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

02:11:49.768 --> 02:11:52.137

02:40:58.415 --> 02:41:00.217
OTHERWISE LIMITING A PATIENT'S

02:41:00.283 --> 02:41:01.618
MEDICAL CARE FOR NON MEDICAL

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:05.022
REASONS. THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

02:41:05.088 --> 02:41:07.290
HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED IN

02:41:07.357 --> 02:41:10.527
THE PAST FEW DECADES ONE TREND

02:41:10.594 --> 02:41:12.596
THAT HAS IMPACTED PATIENT CARE.

02:41:12.662 --> 02:41:15.265
IS THE RAPID PACE OF MERGERS

02:41:15.332 --> 02:41:18.869
AFFILIATIONS IN ACQUISITIONS.

02:41:18.935 --> 02:41:20.070
THESE TRANSACTIONS GIVE

02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:23.273
COMPANIES TREMENDOUS POWER TO

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:25.776
DICTATE PATIENT CARE. EVEN IF

02:41:25.842 --> 02:41:27.844
THEIR MOTIVES ARE PROFIT DRIVEN

02:41:27.911 --> 02:41:30.747
AND DISCRIMINATORY. FOR EXAMPLE

02:41:30.814 --> 02:41:33.183
CEOS CAN IMPOSE POLICIES THAT

02:41:33.250 --> 02:41:35.052
PROHIBIT PHYSICIANS FROM

02:41:35.118 --> 02:41:37.521
DELIVERING EVIDENCE BASED CARE

02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:39.689
TO PATIENTS EVEN WHEN THEIR

02:41:39.756 --> 02:41:40.857
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ARE

02:41:40.924 --> 02:41:43.293
EQUIPPED AND STAFFED TO DELIVER

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.695
THESE SERVICES. THIS IS

02:41:45.762 --> 02:41:48.965
ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IN URGENT

02:41:49.032 --> 02:41:50.834
AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:52.736
BECAUSE FOR SO MANY PATIENTS

02:41:52.803 --> 02:41:55.072
LIVING IN RURAL AREAS THERE ARE

02:41:55.138 --> 02:41:57.607
SIMPLY NO OTHER OPTIONS FOR

02:41:57.674 --> 02:42:00.377
RECEIVING CARE. DESPITE THIS

02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:02.479
FACT AN INCREASING NUMBER OF

02:42:02.546 --> 02:42:04.281
HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ARE

02:42:04.347 --> 02:42:06.650
RESTRICTING THE TYPES OF CARE

02:42:06.716 --> 02:42:09.553
AVAILABLE ON THEIR PREMISES.

02:42:09.619 --> 02:42:10.854
RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT EVIDENCE

02:42:10.921 --> 02:42:12.422
BASED MORE GROUNDED IN MEDICAL

02:42:12.489 --> 02:42:15.692
SCIENCE. PUT PATIENTS LIVES AT

02:42:15.759 --> 02:42:17.294
RISK AND SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:20.464

02:42:29.806 --> 02:42:31.775
MEDICAL SERVICES AND PRESSURE

02:58:27.363 --> 02:58:29.198
THE LAW IS. IT BASICALLY SAYS

02:58:29.265 --> 02:58:31.067
DOCTORS CAN'T BE MESSED WITH

02:58:31.133 --> 02:58:32.334
THEY HAVE THEIR PROFESSIONAL

02:58:32.401 --> 02:58:33.869
OPINION. AND YOU CAN'T MAKE

02:58:33.936 --> 02:58:35.538
DECISIONS ON PROFITABILITY'S OF

02:58:35.604 --> 02:58:38.174
HOSPITALS AND THAT. BODY OF LAW

02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:41.710
IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. NOW WE

02:58:41.777 --> 02:58:43.446
HAVE A SERIES RECENTLY OF A

02:58:43.512 --> 02:58:44.480
BUNCH OF MERGERS AND

02:58:44.547 --> 02:58:45.748
ACQUISITIONS AS WE SEEN ALL

02:58:45.815 --> 02:58:47.917
ACROSS. MANY SPECTRUMS AND WHAT

02:58:47.983 --> 02:58:49.752
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:51.854
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ARE.

02:58:51.921 --> 02:58:53.222
SO WHEN I READ THIS I READ THE

02:58:53.289 --> 02:58:55.691
NARAL CONSTRUCT AS IT RELATES

02:58:55.758 --> 02:58:57.126
TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE.

02:58:57.193 --> 02:58:59.095
BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE

02:58:59.161 --> 02:59:00.729
LARGER ISSUE IN TERMS OF ITS

02:59:00.796 --> 02:59:03.799
IMPACT. AND HOW YOU REALLY AS

02:59:03.866 --> 02:59:05.067
WE DEAL WITH THIS LARGER

02:59:05.134 --> 02:59:06.702
DYNAMIC AND WE DEAL WITH THE

02:59:06.769 --> 02:59:08.337
ISSUE OF. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

02:59:08.404 --> 02:59:09.438
FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ALL OF THE

02:59:09.505 --> 02:59:11.207
LIKE HOW DO WE INTEGRATE ALL

02:59:11.273 --> 02:59:13.042
THIS AND I HAVE SOME

02:59:13.109 --> 02:59:14.910
UNDERSTANDING SO I'M GONNA VOTE

02:59:14.977 --> 02:59:18.080
FOR THIS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW.

02:59:18.147 --> 02:59:20.282

CHACE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT.

02:59:25.020 --> 02:59:26.021
BUT I JUST I JUST HAVE

02:59:26.088 --> 02:59:27.990
QUESTIONS THAT WE GET A CHANCE

02:59:28.057 --> 02:59:29.859
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT TO TRY

02:59:29.925 --> 02:59:31.527

02:59:36.866 --> 02:59:39.435
AS COMPLEX AS HEALTH CARE. AND

02:59:39.502 --> 02:59:41.537
IT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BIT SO I

02:59:41.604 --> 02:59:43.005
JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE I'M

02:59:43.072 --> 02:59:44.540

LEGITIMATE REASONS AND WANTED

TO ARTICULATE I THINK THE

02:59:53.215 --> 02:59:55.251
FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH WE SHOULD

02:59:55.317 --> 02:59:57.086
BE APPROACHING BY THIS MEASURE

02:59:57.153 --> 02:59:58.187
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:59:58.254 --> 02:59:59.555

OR WORD REACH FROM- HE ACTUALLY

03:00:16.305 --> 03:00:17.907
WAS VERY PERSUASIVE BECAUSE I

03:00:19.975 --> 03:00:21.477
QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR.

03:00:21.544 --> 03:00:23.012
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR

03:00:23.078 --> 03:00:24.680
PROVISION THAT SEEMS VERY

03:00:24.747 --> 03:00:25.848
SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ATTORNEY

03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:28.050
GENERAL WAS TRYING TO DO LAST

03:00:28.117 --> 03:00:31.053
YEAR ABOUT APPROVING THE- THE

TRANSFERS OF HOSPITALS THAT

03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:46.635
SEEMS VERY SIGNIFICANT TO ME

03:00:46.702 --> 03:00:48.904
AND SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE. A

03:00:48.971 --> 03:00:50.973

PREPARED TO ENGAGE IN QUESTIONS

03:01:08.524 --> 03:01:10.159
BACK AND FORTH BUT I THINK

WOULD VOTE TO MOVE ALONG BUT

03:01:36.685 --> 03:01:38.153
WOULD CALL OUT THOSE ISSUES AS

03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:39.655
THINGS THAT I THINK ARE WORTHY

03:01:39.722 --> 03:01:41.924
OF CONVERSATIONS AND SEEING HOW

03:01:41.991 --> 03:01:46.362

PROCEDURE CLOSURES HAVE GREATLY

03:26:01.982 --> 03:26:03.684
EXACERBATED THE ISSUE THIS

ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE OPPOSITION

03:26:09.256 --> 03:26:10.691

DRAG OUT CASES UNTIL VICTIMS

03:26:27.842 --> 03:26:30.344
DIE. BECAUSE THE WINDFALL THAT

03:26:30.411 --> 03:26:33.214
REDUCES ACCOUNTABILITY. THE

OPPOSITION IS ALSO STATED THAT

03:26:35.082 --> 03:26:36.450

THESE DAMAGES ARE REAL. AND

03:28:00.534 --> 03:28:01.869
THAT SOMEONE WHO NEGLIGENTLY

COMPENSATE THE VICTIM. BUT WE

03:28:05.573 --> 03:28:06.907

SUFFERING DAMAGES. AND THIS

03:28:32.299 --> 03:28:33.868

CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN

03:42:05.979 --> 03:42:08.815
FRANCISCO GROUNDS FOR LAWSUITS-

03:42:08.882 --> 03:42:10.316
BUT ALSO IN OBSERVING OTHER

03:42:10.383 --> 03:42:13.286
LAWSUITS FRANKLY ARBITRARY

03:42:13.353 --> 03:42:16.923
NATURE OF THIS CUT OFF. AND THE

03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:19.759
FACT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A

03:42:19.826 --> 03:42:21.261
SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE HAPPEN

03:42:21.327 --> 03:42:23.129
TO PASS AWAY IT WOULD

03:42:23.196 --> 03:42:26.232
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE

03:42:26.299 --> 03:42:28.902
MONETARY VALUE OF DAMAGES- ON

03:42:28.968 --> 03:42:32.739

TERMS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS. AND

03:42:36.609 --> 03:42:39.379
SO I THINK- IT IS ARBITRARY AND

03:42:39.446 --> 03:42:41.247
NUTS WILL HAVE A FEW STATES

03:42:41.314 --> 03:42:44.818
HAVE THIS RULE- AND I THINK

03:42:44.884 --> 03:42:49.856
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP. IN

03:42:49.923 --> 03:42:52.025
MIND. THAT THE SUFFERED THE

03:42:52.092 --> 03:42:53.126
NONAKA DAMAGE RUN THROUGH THE

03:42:53.193 --> 03:42:55.061
DAY OF THE- AND ARE CUT OFF. SO

03:42:55.128 --> 03:42:56.529
IT'S STILL THE CASE THAT IF

03:42:56.596 --> 03:42:57.964
SOMEONE LET'S SAY HAS A

03:42:58.031 --> 03:43:01.434
HORRIBLE- INJURY AND AS A-

03:43:01.501 --> 03:43:03.970
QUADRIPLEGIC OR A SERIOUS BRAIN

03:43:04.037 --> 03:43:06.005
INJURY AND IS TWENTY EIGHT

03:43:06.072 --> 03:43:07.841
YEARS OLD AND IS ANTICIPATED TO

03:43:07.907 --> 03:43:09.542
LIVE FOR ANOTHER. FORTY OR

03:43:09.609 --> 03:43:11.111
FIFTY YEARS THAT PERSON IS

03:43:11.177 --> 03:43:13.847
GONNA GET DRAMATICALLY MORE IN

03:43:13.913 --> 03:43:15.882
TERMS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING NON

03:43:15.949 --> 03:43:17.784

YEAR LATER FROM THOSE INJURIES

03:43:22.822 --> 03:43:24.557
SO THIS IS NOT THE CASE OVER TO

03:43:24.624 --> 03:43:26.459
US THIS OPENING UP THE DOORS

03:43:26.526 --> 03:43:28.194
AND YOU CAN AWARD WHATEVER YOU

03:43:28.261 --> 03:43:30.296
WANTS. ON IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE

03:43:30.363 --> 03:43:31.598
A LITTLE BIT OF SUBJECTIVITY IN

03:43:31.664 --> 03:43:34.701
TERMS OF WHAT THE JURY AWARDS-

03:43:34.768 --> 03:43:37.370
BY IN MY EXPERIENCE JURIES ARE.

03:43:37.437 --> 03:43:39.272
I AM AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY TRIED

03:43:39.339 --> 03:43:40.974

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:42.809
SEVERAL CONTACTS OR CASES.
