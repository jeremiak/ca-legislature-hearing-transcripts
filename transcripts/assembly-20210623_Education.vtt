AND MY FATHER IS HEAVILY

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:02.140
INVOLVED IN THE NORTH STATE AND

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:04.075
RECRUITMENT SO WHEN I SAW SO I

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:06.544
WAS. CONFUSED TO BE HONEST

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:07.445
BECAUSE THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:08.780
ENTITIES AND THEY'VE BUILT

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.348

NONPROFITS. AND SO WHEN WE WHEN

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.757
I QUESTIONED- YOU KNOW WHAT WHY

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.926
ARE WE INVOLVED IN THIS WELL SO

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:23.928
IT'S THE RECORD I WANT TO BE

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:24.695
CLEAR IT'S A RECRUITMENT FROM

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:27.565
THE SCHOOLS THAT MAKES THIS.

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:29.534
THE INVOLVEMENT OKAY. SO

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.002
RECRUITMENT FOR MY FATHER

00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:32.437
INCLUDES WALKING AND HANDING

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:34.372
HAS. SLIPPED TO THE YOU KNOW

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:35.807
FLYERS THE PRINCIPLE TO SAY

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:37.675
LET'S REMEMBER. THIS IS COMING

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.710
UP WE NEED KIDS IT'S VERY

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:41.179
ACTUALLY HARDER TO RECRUIT THAN

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:43.247
YOU CAN IMAGINE AS I'M SPEAKING

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:43.881
FOR THAT OUR STATE I DON'T KNOW

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.583
ABOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.452
IT'S ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE TO

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:50.121
SEND GIRLS FROM THE NORTH STATE.

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:51.789
TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:53.424
GUESS MY QUESTION IS WE'RE NOT

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:56.961
GOING TO. FORCED PROGRAMS THAT

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:58.763
ARE NONPROFIT PROGRAMS TO

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.832
RELOCATE TO A DIFFERENT CAMPUS

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.166
BECAUSE THE REASON THEY DON'T

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:05.770
HAVE ACCESS TO. THE CAPITALS

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:06.304
BECAUSE THERE IN SOUTHERN

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.475
CALIFORNIA. CORRECT NO- WE HAVE

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:12.043
LOTS OF YOUNG MEN FROM SOUTHERN

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:13.277
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PART OF BOYS

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:14.445
STATE THE TRAVEL UP TO THE

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:16.314
CAPITAL RIGHT BUT THE GIRLS

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.815
STATE PROGRAM IS LOCATED IN

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:19.150
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THAT IT

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:20.251
WAS SO PART OF THEIR PROGRAM IS

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:21.786
A BUILT OUT TO ATTEND LIKE WE

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:23.955
HERE I THINK THIS WEEK

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:25.690
ACTUALLY. AND THEY WILL BE

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:27.825
THROUGH THE HALLS SO WE'RE

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:28.893
GOING TO BE ASKING THE AMERICAN

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.762
THE AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:34.565
TO RELOCATE THEIR CONFERENCE.

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.200
TO SACRAMENTO THEY DON'T HAVE

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:37.101
TO BUT IF THEY DON'T THEN THE

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:38.436
BOYS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.904
SACRAMENTO. THIS IS JUST

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.039
STRICTLY ABOUT EQUITY AND

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:44.008
MAKING SURE THAT BOTH PROGRAMS.

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.410
OFFER THE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:48.145
PROGRAMS. THAT YOU KNOW YOU

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:49.780
THINK ABOUT IT SO IF THEY HAVE

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:51.549
TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM YES. WE

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.584
WORK WITH THE AUXILIARY THAT IS

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:56.087
OPPOSITION. THEY ARE IN SUPPORT

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:58.456
NOW- IT CAN YOU JUST THINK

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:00.258
ABOUT IT SO AS A PART OF THE

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:02.159
STARTED FOR ME. ASSEMBLY WOMAN

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:04.028
WHEN I WOULD SEE THE THOUSANDS

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.229
OF BOYS ARE HUNDREDS OF BOYS

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:06.497
COMING TO BOISE STATE UP HERE

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:07.965
AND I SAID WHY DON'T THE GIRLS

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.534
ALLOWED ONE OF THE GIRLS HERE.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.735
AND I DON'T KNOW THE GIRLS

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:11.536
AREN'T ALLOWED TO COME NICE

00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:13.304
WHAT SEEMS WRONG. YOU KNOW WHEN

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:14.205
YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.606
WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT FEMALE

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.275
LEGISLATORS. WHICH IS THE MOST

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:19.277
WE HAVE HAD IN HISTORY OUT OF A

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:20.778
HUNDRED AND TWENTY. WE NEED

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.179
MORE WOMEN COMING SO THEY CAN

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.915
SEE THAT THEY CAN BE IN THE-

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.149
ASSEMBLY THAT THEY CAN BE IN

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:27.051
THE SENATE. SO YES THEY ARE

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:28.119
GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:29.654
PROGRAM AND LIKE I SAID THE

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.621
AMENDMENTS WE'VE TAKEN HAVE

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:32.290
REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.325
BILL. SO I AGREE THAT WE NEED

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:38.729
EQUITY AND- I'M- A WOMAN. TO A

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:41.832
POSITION. BUT- I THINK OR ME.

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:44.368
I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:45.503
TODAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.838
IT'S- WE CAN JUST. MAYBE NOT

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.006
RECRUITING MORE OUT OF THE

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:50.441
SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.109
ASKING A NONPROFIT WHO'S BEEN

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:53.177
DOING THIS SUCCESSFULLY FOR

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:54.378
DECADES AND YES OR NEEDS TO BE

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.814
IMPROVEMENTS I AGREE. BUT

00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:58.182
THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT MONEY

00:36:58.249 --> 00:36:59.884
THERE ARE IN THESE PROGRAMS

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:02.253
THERE'D WE DON'T FIND THIS. AND

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.988
A GIRL SAY IS JUST GROSSLY

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.222
UNDER FUNDED AND THAT'S JUST

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:06.624
COMING OUT OF THE COMMUNITIES.

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:09.093
AND THE NONPROFIT ITSELF SO.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.661
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:12.129
OVER HERE OTHER THAN IF WE WANT

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.598
TO GET INVOLVED OURSELVES AND

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:14.832
HELP FUND THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.668
THEY DO. AND THEN OUR STATE. SO

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:19.604
THANK YOU. FOR THAT AND I WOULD

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.005
JUST SAY THAT I THINK WE HAVE

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.807
TO DEFINE SUCCESS. IF THE

00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:24.709
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.677
THE IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:27.778
THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:28.579
BECAUSE THESE YOUNG WOMEN

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.881
HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO

00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:34.952
SEE THEIR GOVERNMENT. ACTION

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:35.553
THEY'RE SINGING SONGS THE ARE

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.587
VERY HONESTLY VERY DEMEANING.

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.255
AND SO I. THAT MAYBE THAT

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:39.724
SUCCESS WAS IN THE FIFTIES AND

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.792
SIXTIES. BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.127
AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE TO GET

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.695
BETTER AND THIS BILL IS JUST

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:45.863
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.465
DOING THAT FOR THE GIRLS AS

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:51.802
WELL AS THE YOUNG MAN. GOOD MR

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:57.775
LINK. IT IS TOO LATE. I SCITECH

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:58.943
DAUGHTER FOR BRING US FOR IT I

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.277
ALSO KNEW THE SIMILAR THING

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.946
WHEN I WAS STAFF AND I WOULD

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.214
SET MY BOSSES BIGGER VOICE

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.348
STATE AND I WOULD ASK OF ONE OF

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:05.950
THE GIRLS COMING OFF AND IF

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.652
THEY DON'T COME UP AS A LOT. OF

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.820
SOMETHING TO MAYBE TO ADDRESS

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:11.355
MY COLLEAGUES POINT TO IS I

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:13.324
KNOW IN MY NOTES THAT GIRL

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:15.493
STATE HAS 50% FEWER APPLICANTS

00:38:15.559 --> 00:38:17.194
AND THEY ALSO PAY A SEVENTY

00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:17.895
FIVE DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.163
WELL BOYS STATE THEY'LL PAY

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.164
ANYTHING AND IT'S DOUBLE THE

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:21.198
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE SO THERE IS AN

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.767
UNFAIRNESS THERE TO THAT POINT

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.335
YET SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:25.403
ABLE TO ADDRESS THE FUNDING

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.004
ISSUE BY HAVING A CRUEL PAY

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:28.105
STRUCTURES LAW OF COURSE YOU

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.807

A FEW MORE EQUITABLY DISPERSED

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:33.277
THAT WAY I DO THINK IT'S

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:35.479
IMPORTANT WHAT- EQUITY MEASURE

00:38:35.546 --> 00:38:37.014

COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OFTEN THESE

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:20.684
PROGRAMS ARE GENERATIONAL IN

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.787
THE SENSE THAT. WHETHER IT'S

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.221

ARE SHUT TO A VERY. UNDERSERVED

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:37.968
COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:39.637
COLOR BECAUSE NOBODY IN THEIR

FOUR H. OUR BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:45.476

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.178
PARTICULARLY AT THE SCHOOLS

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.113
WERE THE INVITATIONS ARE MADE

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.615
TO WHETHER IT'S THE- GIRL OR

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:53.284
THE YOUNG BOY A LOT OF TIMES

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.819
THAT THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.987
AT THE PRINCIPAL. OFFICE OR AT

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.622

FAMILIES BEING INVITED SO I

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.268
SUPPORT THIS BUT I DO THINK AS

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.804
WE EVOLVE. THESE MEASURES OF

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:16.807
EQUITY. NOT TO SAY EVERY BOY
