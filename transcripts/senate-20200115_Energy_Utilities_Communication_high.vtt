00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.460
A WORK IN PROGRESS AND THAT

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:23.963
BLACKOUTS. AND BLACKOUTS ARE A

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.498
HUGE ISSUE- THROUGHOUT

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:33.506
AS WELL AS ALL OF OUR

00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:35.875
CONVERSATIONS UP WITH THE

A CONTINUING CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:41.480
SB THREE SEVEN A I THINK IS A

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:44.684
GOOD FAITH. EFFORT TO TRY TO

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.686
GRAPPLE WITH THESE GALS THAT

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.421
ARE HAVING A HORRENDOUS

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.589
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:55.394
CALIFORNIA- WE'VE SEEN THAT-

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.063
IN- GINNY TERRITORY OF COURSE

00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:02.134
IN MOST DRAMATIC FORM OF

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:05.037
BLACKOUT AFFECTING ABOUT. A

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:08.441
HALF MILLION PEOPLE. SEEN IT

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:12.545
CALIFORNIA WELL. I'M MORE CLEAR

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:13.412
I'M NOT AGAINST PLANNED PLANNED

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:14.213
BLACKOUTS AS A GENERAL MATTER

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.581
THEY CAN BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:16.682
PARTICULARLY- FOR UTILITIES

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.450
LIKE P. GINNY THAT HAVE ALLOWED

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:18.884
THEIR SYSTEM TO DETERIORATE SO

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.319
BADLY THAT'S CAUSING A HUGE

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:21.454
WILDFIRE RISK WE HAVE TO

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.456
REMEMBER WHAT THE ROOT CAUSES

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:24.991
YOU TO IN A THE FAILURE TO

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.360
MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT IT

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:29.628
ISN'T UNTIL WE CAN GET THAT

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:31.397
TURNED AROUND PLAN BLACKOUTS

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.599
SHOULD BE ONE TOOL IN THE

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.434
TOOLBOX. BUT THE CHALLENGE THAT

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:37.536
WE FACE AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN-

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:40.473
PARTICULARLY WITH P. GINNY BUT

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.009
NOT JUST. ANY IS THAT THERE IS

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.477
UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW A

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.479
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO ERR ON

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.781
THE SIDE OF BROADER BLACKOUTS-

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:50.549
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:54.253
UTILITIES- IN A- AT THE COST OF

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.722
DOING A BLOCK OF THERE'S A COST.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.624
BUT I IS NOT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.127
TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THE COSTS

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:02.795
THAT THE UTILITY IS INFLICTING

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:03.596
ON THE POP IN GENERAL

00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:07.166
POPULATION. THE ONLY TAKE INTO

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.435
ACCOUNT THEIR OWN COST BENEFIT

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.204
BALANCE FOR THE UTILITY ITSELF.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:14.573
AND THE UTILITY DOES NOT EVEN

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.107
HAVE TO OTHER THAN THROUGH

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:18.577
POLITICAL PRESSURE. THE UTILITY

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.146
DOES NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:22.748
ATTENTION. TO THE COST AND THE

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:25.484
HARMS INFLICTED ON PEOPLE AND

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:26.685
THOSE COSTS ARE REAL IT'S NOT

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.788
JUST AN INCONVENIENCE RIGHT

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.289
THAT YOU CAN'T WATCH YOU KNOW

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.024

FOOT MASSAGER IT'S NOT JUST

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.266
CONVENIENCES. THIS IS ABOUT

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:41.534
LIFE OR DEATH IN A LOT OF

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.536
SITUATION WHEN WE KNOW THAT

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:45.171

THEY HAVE TO PLUG IN OR THEY

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:52.011
HAVE REFRIGERATED MEDICATION-

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.512
AND THAT IS A LIFE OR DEATH

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.548
SITUATION. WE KNOW ABOUT THE

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.349
PUBLIC SAFETY PROBLEMS THAT

TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:52.464

CPUC- AND PURSUING TOOK A MEMO

WE'RE GIVING THE CPC

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:13.586
FLEXIBILITY ABOUT SETTING UP

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:16.355
THAT SYSTEM AND WHAT EXACTLY IS

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:17.456
COMPENSATED SO WE'RE NOT GOING

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:22.394
HAVE SOME LATITUDE TO SET UP-

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.897
THAT- THAT SYSTEM. ON IT IN

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.433
ADDITION- WILL- THERE WILL BE

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:29.235
AN HOURLY FEE WHICH WE'VE

THE CPC DETERMINES THAT THE

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:38.010
BLACKOUT WAS UNREASONABLE- SO

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:41.413
WE SCALE THAT BACK I THINK IN

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.082

WERE HOT WE WERE WILLING TO

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.169
TAKE THAT OUT BECAUSE THAT IS A

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.971
SIGNIFICANT. IDEA I COULD

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:08.440

HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT EITHER

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.821
SO- PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:18.290
MONEY TO BUY A GENERATOR SO

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:19.658
THEY COULD SAVE THE FOOD THAT

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.293
THEY PAID THAT THEY PAID FOR.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.199
WHAT DO YOU DO. AND ALSO I HAVE

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:28.333

BECAUSE THEY'RE ELECTED BASED

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.622
SO THAT MEANS OKAY I NEED A

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.524
GENERATOR NOW I NEED TO GO OUT

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.027

BUSINESSES- IS NOT. THE RIGHT

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:03.095
WAY TO PROCEED- I THINK THAT

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:04.529
THERE ARE MANY BUSINESSES WHO

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:07.699

INTERFACE BUT I THINK ONE OF

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.506
THE- MISS NUMBERS ABOUT THAT IS

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:15.841
THAT YOU THINK ABOUT. THE

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:17.476
WILDLIFE FOR INTERVENTION IT

WILDERNESS. I LIVE IN SANTA

SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE CITY OF

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:30.922
SANTA ROSA. AND LOST POWER SIX

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:34.860
TIMES- KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL. FOR

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:37.696
TWO AND A HALF WEEKS. AND

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.031
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I'M

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:41.900
GONNA- ORGANIZE MY WORK DAY.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.870
AROUND THAT. AND IN. IN

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:47.706
RESPONSE TO THAT TOO AND- DAYS

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:49.408
OF MISS SCHOOL- THEY GET HALF

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:51.576
DAY. OF IT BACK FOR. THAT TIME

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.412
UP- BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:56.515
TO FIND GENERATORS. SHIFTING

00:21:56.581 --> 00:22:00.419
ARE RISKS. FROM UTILITIES WHO

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:02.320
ARE THE EXPERTS IN THIS TO.

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:03.822
VISUAL BUSINESSES TO FIRE UP.

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:07.025
THE RAIDERS AND FIGURE OUT ALL

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:08.460
THOSE THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:09.861
THEIR BUSINESSES ARE. EVEN

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:10.996
THOUGH COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE. IS

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:15.600
NOT NECESSARILY. A FOR THE

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:20.605
PUBLIC. I'M I WOULD SAY THAT

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:21.206
PART OF WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:21.840
IT- THROUGH THIS IS TRYING TO

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:22.607
REACH OUT TO OTHER BUSINESS

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:23.108
OWNERS TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:23.775
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS. ARE EVER

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:24.409
CENTER IS A IS A LARGE RETAIL

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:26.511
OPERATION IN SANTA ROSA- I KNOW

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:28.747
THE OWNERS OF UPPER CENTER AND

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:29.614
THEY HAVE EXPRESSED TO ME THAT

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.483
THESE POWER SHUT OFFS COSTS

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.784
THEM. A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.686
DOLLARS DURING THIS- SHUT OFF

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.421
TIME- AND THEY HAD THEIR POWER

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.757
ON. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:41.526
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE EVACUATED.

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.628
AND SO MANY PEOPLE I CHOSE TO

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.831
STAY AT HOME BECAUSE OF- THE

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:48.200
SITUATION THAT THEY LOST

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:50.502
SIGNIFICANT REVENUE. SO WE NEED

00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:52.003
TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.239
NOT JUST FOR THOSE WHO LOSE

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:55.974
POWER BUT FOR THOSE BUSINESSES

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.976
THAT HAVE POWER STILL ON AND

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.478
THE EFFECTS OF THAT IN THE

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:01.780
COMMUNITY- I WOULD SAY IF I

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:05.684
CAN'T VERY QUICKLY- THAT ARE

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:07.385
THROUGH THE CPUC. IN MIND JOINT

00:23:07.452 --> 00:23:09.588
ERROR- AND IN THE PRECEDING

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:12.190
RELATED TO THE POWER SHUT OFF

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:14.159
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT CAN

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.027
BE DONE AND I THINK THE BIG

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:18.463
THING THAT. BILL DOES IN THAT I

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.998
SUPPORT IS THAT THE UTILITIES

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:23.535
FIND SHEL SUCCESS. NEEDS TO BE

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:24.136
TIED TO OUR SUCCESS. AND THAT

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:24.770
HAS BEEN LARGELY MISSING FROM

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:27.072
THE EQUATION. AND ALTHOUGH

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:28.940
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:30.709
UTILITIES ARE LOOKING OUT FOR

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:33.245
PUBLIC INTERESTS. AND LESS IT

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:33.845
IS TIED TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:37.282
INTERESTS. IT WON'T HAVE A PATH

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:40.585
FORWARD- I JUST WANTED TO ALSO

00:23:40.652 --> 00:23:41.920

FOR ME DOWN THE HOME STRETCH OF

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:34.371
THE BILL MAKES IT OUT BECAUSE

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:45.116

THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT BANNING

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:36.092

THEY CAN SAVE. LIVES AND

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.734
PROPERTY IS ABOUT ESTABLISHING

A RUBIO SAID A BALANCE I AGREE

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.809
WE NEED A BALANCE AND RIGHT NOW

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.110

AND BIGGER AND MORE FREQUENT

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:03.687
BLACKOUTS. TWO AND A HALF

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:06.022
MILLION PEOPLE IMPACTED UP ONE

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:08.525

RIGHT NOW WE ARE AT TIME SEEING

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:22.873
A SLEDGE HAMMER APPROACH. AND

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:25.509
THAT IS VERY VERY HOPEFUL TO

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:32.516
INDIVIDUAL- TO LOOK BOOK UNITY

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:41.625

EIGHTY SIX IS A DISTRICT BILL

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:40.784
WHICH WILL PROVIDE ECONOMIC

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.953
FLEXIBILITY TO THE MODESTO

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:44.254
INTERLOCUTORS XIN DISTRICTS AND

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:46.623
THE RATE PAYERS. THAT HAVE BEEN

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.024
PRODUCING ZERO CARBON ENERGY

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.726
FOR OVER OVER THE YEARS YOU YOU

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:53.229
HEARD THIS BILL- IN AND IT

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:55.465
PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE-

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:57.500
AND THAT AMENDMENT THAT WE MADE

00:53:57.567 --> 00:54:00.537
WAS TO BE IN RESPONSE TO

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:02.973
OPPOSITION THE CONCERN THAT

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:05.942
THESE VARIEGATION DISTRICTS

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:06.943
COULD BACKSLIDE AND USE. THE

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.678
ENERGY- BE AMENDED THE BILL TO

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:11.648
ALLOW. ME TO REQUIRE THEM TO

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:14.117
INVEST. THE RESOURCES THAT THEY

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:15.785
OTHRWISE WOULD INVEST IN IN

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:18.888
SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY IN ENERGY

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:21.858
STORAGE- SO THAT- WE COULD.

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.661
HELP THEM TO MEET THEIR ENERGY

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:26.863
GOALS AND ALSO MEET THE NEEDS

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.265
OF THE RATE PAYERS- BECAUSE

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:30.834
RIGHT NOW WHICH WHAT THEY ARE

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.637
DOING IS GENERATING ENERGY

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:35.205
WHICH THEY DON'T NEED ANY SELL

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:37.641
OFF AT A LOSS WHICH- IS THERE.

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:38.541
HERE'S TO PAY THE SCIENCE IS

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.377
CLEAR RENEWABLE ENERGY IS

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:43.113
GENERATED FROM SOLAR WIND AND

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:43.947
WATER WHEN THE R. PS WAS

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.882
CREATED SOLAR AND WIND NEEDED A

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:48.818
SUBSIDY TO COMPETE IN

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:49.352
CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MARKET

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:54.457
BECAUSE IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE.

00:54:54.524 --> 00:54:56.926
TEN PLUS YEARS LATER CALIFORNIA.

00:54:56.993 --> 00:54:57.827
HAVE BEEN PAYING EIGHT KERR

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.396
SAYS WE'RE ENERG IN ORDER TO

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:00.964
CURB OVER GENERATION AND

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:03.633
MAINTAIN A RELIABLE GRADE. LOW

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.934
INCOME AND POOR COMMUNITIES IN

00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:06.703
SENATE-DISTRICT TWELVE HAVE

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.405
BEEN SUBSIDIZING SOLAR ENERGY

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:10.073
FOR WEALTHY POPULATED COASTAL

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.975
COMMUNITIES SINCE THE OUR PS

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:14.744
WAS ENACTED SB THREE EIGHTY SIX

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:17.313
IS AN EFORT TO MAKE MODEST

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.149
STEPS TOWARDS THAT INEQUALITY.

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:21.151
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE-

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:22.952
TERM IS CLIMATE GOALS LARGE

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:24.621
HYDRO AS A RECOGNIZED RENEWABLE

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:27.257
ENERGY SOURCE WASHINGTON STATE

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:28.525
WILL GET 21100% RENEWABLE

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.160
ENEGY BEFORE CALIFORNIA BY

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:33.329
KIND COUNTING HYDRO. CALIFORNIA

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:34.798
INSTEAD PLACE POLITICS IS WHAT

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:36.399
COUNTS AND WHEN THE GOAL TO

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:37.934
REACH SO THAT WALL STREET BACK

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.270
SOLAR ENERGY FIRMS CAN CONTINUE

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:42.038
CONVERTING AGRICULTURAL LAND

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.640
INTO SOLAR FARMS. OR SO THAT

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:45.575
MASSIVE PART OF THE NEVADA

00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:46.710
DESERT CAN BE CONVERTED TO

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:48.144
SOLAR FORMS WITH NEW

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.145
TRANSMISSION LINES IN

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.246
INFRASTRUCTURE CARING THAT

00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:51.915
RENEWABLE ENERGY HUNDREDS OF

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:53.083
MILES BACK THROUGH NATURAL

00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:55.552
LANDS RIGHT BACK TO LOS

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:57.420
ANGELES. SB THREE EIGHTY SIX

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:59.122
WAS MADE INTO A STATEWIDE

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.790
LIGHTNING ROD LAST YEAR- AS I

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:02.492
SAID THIS COMMITTEE PASSED IT

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:05.462
OUT AND IT WAS SET TO BE HEARD

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:06.196
ON THE FLOOR. AND FORMER

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:07.630
LEADERS OF THIS SENATE AND THE

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:08.698
ASSEMBLY FROM SOUTHERN

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.867
CALIFORNIA USE THE SEAL OF THE

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:11.901
LEGISLATURE TO PUSH MEMBERS

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:15.038
INTO CHANGING THEIR VOTE. AS I

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:15.638
SAID AFTER IT PASSED FROM THIS

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:18.575
COMMITTEE. SB THREE EIGHTY SIX

00:56:18.641 --> 00:56:20.877
IS NOT SET NEW PRESIDENT. OTHER

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.246
PO USE CURRENTLY COUNT THEIR

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:24.681
HYDRO ENERGY TO SATISFY

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.182
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROCUREMENT

00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:27.851
REQUIREMENTS. THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:30.453
THAT THOSE PO USE GET TO COUNT

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.756
OVER 50% OF THEIR HYDRO ENERGY

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:35.125
AND DON'T YOU TO PROCURE EXCEPT

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.760
RENEWABLES. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.928
THEIR ENERGY COMES FROM GROW.

00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:40.163
NOW THERE IS A TYPICAL

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.699
GOVERNMENT CREATED OXYMORON.

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.601
THE PROBLEM IS IT TURLOCK IN

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:46.102
MODESTO DO NOT GET ENOUGH OF

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:48.772
THEIR ENERGY FROM DON PEDRO DAM

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.406
OR THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR IN

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.809
OUR P. S. EXEMPTION IN OTHER

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:53.777
WORDS SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.513
EXEMPTION BUT NOT- RURAL

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.615
CALIFORNIA. SB THREE EIGHTY

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.450
SIXES ABOUT EQUITY UNDER THE

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:04.187
OUR PS AND NOT PLAYING POLITICS

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:04.754
WITH SCIENCE IN ORDER TO

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:06.556
MANIPULATE POLITICAL IN ENERGY

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.691
MARKETS. WHEN FEDERAL DOLLY

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.593
COMMITTEE SUBSIDIZE ENERGY FOR

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.629
OTHERS. THIS IS A VERY OF A

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:14.964
REGRESSIVE TAX ON OUR POOREST

00:57:15.031 --> 00:57:16.499
COMMUNITIES IN THE FORM OF HIGH

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:19.602
ENERGY COSTS. AS WE DID IN THE

00:57:19.669 --> 00:57:21.738
ANALYSIS HE COSTS ARE NOT IN

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.540
THIS VALLEY WHERE IT IS HOT IN

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:26.709
THE SUMMER AND COLD IN THE

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:29.279
WINTER AND TIERED RATE SYSTEM.

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:31.548
POOR THE MOST. JEAN SECURITY IS

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:32.248
HIGHEST. IN THE CENTRAL IN

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:33.149
IMPERIAL VALLEY'S. INNER

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:34.417
WEALTHIEST COASTAL AREAS WHERE

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.920
TEMPERATURES ARE MORE MODERATE.

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:38.655
THE CURRENT SYSTEM WILL HAVE

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:39.656
THESE POOR COMMUNITY

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:42.192
SUBSIDIZING SOLAR AND WIND FOR

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:44.627
ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS IGNORING

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:46.362
GOOD SCIENCE THE COUNT WATER

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:49.365
SOLAR AND WIND ACT EQUITABLY.

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:50.233
REGARDING THE COST LIMITATION%

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:53.469
COMPLIANCE OPTION DON PEDRO IS

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:54.337
AN ASSET THAT IS OWNED BY THE

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:56.005
DISTRICTS PURSUING ACOSTA

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:57.574
LIMITATION OP OPTION WHICH IS

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.610
IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS WOULD

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.779
NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DISTRICTS

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.647
FINANCING STANDING. THE

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:05.982
DISTRICT MIGHT MUST ENSURE

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:08.585
CONTINUED CAPITAL AXIS AT

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.787
REASONABLE COST IN ORDER TO

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:11.721
MAINTAIN THE DAM AND OTHER

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:14.357
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ASSETS THE

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:16.025
DISTRICTS CREDIT PROFILE IS

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.460
ALREADY LIMITED BY THE

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.195
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES THAT EXCEED

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:21.097
STATE AND NATIONAL AVERAGES AND

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:23.099
THE DEPRESSD ECONOMIC PROFILE

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:25.568
OF THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY. THE

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:27.570
COST LIMITATION OPTION WOULD

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:30.540
ESSENTIALLY INDICATE TO THE

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.542
MARKET THAT THE DISTRICTS COULD

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:33.676
NOT MEET THEIR FINANCIAL

IF I MIGHT SAY- PART OF WHAT

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:14.577
WHAT HAS BECOME CLEAR TO ME IN

THIS WHOLE ENERGY SECTOR AS WE

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.449

THAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

HIGHER THE RISK OF FIRES. IS

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:34.497
THAT WE HAVE DONE A REALLY POOR

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:35.865
JOB OF GUARANTEEING THAT WE'RE

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.300

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.603
KNOWS WE'VE BEEN A LEADER IN

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:54.537
FIGHTING FOR LOWER RATES AND

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.471
FOR PROTECTING LOW INCOME

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:57.473

THAT THREE EIGHTY SIX HELPS

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.144
LEASE LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS AND

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:04.147
IT WOULD BE IN OUR VIEW HIGHLY

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.448
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CHEAT IN A

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.565

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:31.433
BEFORE WHAT I VOTED ON IT. I

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.368

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:33.869
QUESTIONS- THAT THE PERMIT. ONE

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.638
OF THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:39.542
IS- THE LAST 40% YOU CAN USE

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:41.944
HYDRO AS PART OF YOUR- ACCOUNT

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.579
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:48.751
IS YOU KNOW WHY IS IT WHY ISN'T

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:49.318
THAT GOOD ENOUGH WHAT'S THE

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:53.556
ECONOMIC. IMPACT OF WITHIN THE

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.690
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ALREADY THE

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:57.560
POLICIES WE HAVE A PLACE TODAY

01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:02.164
AND- YOUR ACHIEVING THAT 60%

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.700
AND THEN USE IT THE YOU UTILIZE

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:07.469
THE LAST 40% AS- PART OF A-

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:09.605
100% GOAL. REALLY GOOD QUESTION

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:12.007
THAT THE IT WHO HAS TO DO WITH

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.176
WHEN YOU GET TO COUNT HYDRO-

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:18.147
FOR THE USERS THAT ARE. I WOULD

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:20.316
SAY. AND THIS IS PART OF THE

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.217
INEQUITY IN THE SYSTEM IS THAT

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:25.421
IF YOUR IF YOUR USE OF HYDRO IS

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:26.855
SMALL ENOUGH THEN YOU GET TO

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:30.993
COUNT IT NOW- AND- AND AS I

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.461
SAID IS THIS PERVERSE THIS

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:35.264
PERVERSE SYSTEM IS. THE DON

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:37.399
PEDRO JENNA DAM HAS BEEN THERE

01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:39.969
FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS IT'S

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.637
NINETY THREE OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:46.375
THAT- AND- AND IT'S BEEN GREEN

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:48.744
FOR BEGINNING JUST AND- THAT

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:51.180
THE- POINT AT WHICH YOU'VE GOT

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.649
TO CAPITA IT. NOW DOESN'T TO

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:57.052
YOUR BET. ARE YOU AFTER MARK

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:57.853
YEAH I DID HIT TARGET TWENTY

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.054
TWENTY HAVE TO HIT TARGETS FOR

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.322
TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN AT THE

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:02.358
END YOU CAN USE THAT FOR TWENTY

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:05.527
FORTY FIVE. AND SO THAT THEY

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:07.429
THEIR THESE PARTICULAR

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:09.465
IRRIGATION DISTRICTS HAVE HAD

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:12.601
MAJOR INVESTMENTS. IN SOLAR AND

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:13.168
WIND ENERGY DESPITE THE FACT

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:16.839
THAT. DAM GENERATED OF ENERGY-

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.307
ALMOST BY ITSELF DEPENDING ON

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:20.342
THE YEAR FOR THE RATE PAYERS

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:21.877
AND SO THEY END UP WITH EXCESS

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.178
ENERGY AND HAVE TO SELL IT

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.447
SOMETIMES IN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.616
SOMETIMES OUT OF STATE AND

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.918
BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD TO PAY A

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:33.222
PREMIUM FOR THAT DEVELOPMENT OF

01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:34.289
THEIR SOLAR IN THEIR WIND

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:37.192
ENERGY. FACILITIES THEY HAVE TO

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:39.762
SELL IT AT A LOSS AGAIN THE

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:41.664
RATE PAYERS PAY THE COST OF

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.100
THAT AND SO THAT THAT. IT DID

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:47.002
ACT THAT'S THE ANSWER TO IT IS

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:49.672
A GET TO USE IT AT THE VERY END

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:50.873
BUT YOU CAN'T USE IT NOW THEY

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:54.076
HAVE TO CONTINUE MAKING AND

01:11:54.143 --> 01:12:00.549
COMMENCE. BUT THE YOU MADE IN

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:01.850
YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY WAS

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:04.620

FOR YOUR RATE THE RATE PAYERS

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:08.490
OF PAY MORE. IT'S ALSO MY

THE CODE AT THIS POINT TIME

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:19.101
THAT. THE GOOD THERE COULD BE

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:19.968

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.469
A BIG PART OF THE PASSION I

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.571
HAVE FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:32.074
IS THAT. ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.542
ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.643
AND THERE ARE INDEED TENDING

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.980
CONSEQUENCES- AND I FEEL PART

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:41.717
OF OUR OBLIGATION IS TO. SAY

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:45.287
LOOK HERE'S THE SCIENCE. ARE

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:46.221
YOU THAT THE AIR IS GONNA GET

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:46.789
DIRTY OR BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:47.389
COUNT HYDRO NOT NOW THAT'S

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.691
DISINGENUOUS TO ME. IF YOU'RE

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.994
SAYING WE MAY REVERT TO DIRTY

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.097
YOUR SOURCES OF ENERGY I GET IT

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.832
AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:58.367
LOOKED AT. UP PUTTING A

01:13:58.433 --> 01:13:59.868
LIMITATION F THE WHICH YOU

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.537
CAN'T BACKSLIDE NUMBER ONE AND

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.505
NUMBER TWO. LET'S LOOK AT

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.840
STORAGE BECAUSE THERE'S

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:06.809
DEFINITELY A NEED FOR STORAGE

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:09.044
AND- AND THAT'S- WHAT THE COST

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.580
MORE YES BUT IT SOLVES ANOTHER

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:12.648
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.216
WHICH IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.785
ULTIMATELY. NEED STORAGE WHEN

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.520
THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW IN THE

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:20.823
SUN DOESN'T SHINE. AND IF IT'S

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:23.525
A DROUGHT THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.160
STORAGE AND SO THAT'S THE

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:26.161
REASON WE MOVE IN THAT

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:28.030
DIRECTION BUT BUT AT THIS POINT

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:31.266
TO IT. I GUESS I JUST FELT LIKE

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.268
ON BEHALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS IT

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:40.642
HAD TO BE HEARD. AND I AM

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:41.210
ASKING THE COMMITTEE VOTE TO

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:50.285
HOLD THE BILL THANK YOU. NEED

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:51.587
BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR TAKES

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:52.654
GREAT COURAGE BUT AS YOU SHOULD

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:53.488
CLEARLY STATED THIS IS ABOUT

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:54.389
BEING HONEST AND GENUINE AND

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:55.090
TRANSPARENT TO NOT ONLY YOUR

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:55.691
DISTRICT BUT TO THE STATE OF

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.426
CALIFORNIA I WAS A CHEER OF

01:14:57.492 --> 01:14:58.827
UTILITY COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.929
WHEN OUR PS BILLS ARE MOVING

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.764
FOR IT WAS A MAJOR FIGHT TO

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:03.765
MAKE SURE HYDRO WAS NOT

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:05.968
INCLUDED IN THAT BECAUSE IT

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.502
ALLOWED US TO BUILD A LOT OF

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.905
AND SOLAR THAT TRULY WAS NEEDED

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.740
BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE'RE

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.475
SHEDDING MORE POWER HERE IN THE

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:14.409
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.178
MORE TO NEVADA THERE WERE USING

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:18.614
DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.482
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BE HONEST

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.149
I'M GOING TO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:24.219
A DRUG- FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:25.821
THAT'S THE REASON A DARKER VIEW

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:29.157
IS GROWING BECAUSE WE'RE

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:29.758
BUILDING. MORE OPEN AND SOLAR

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.561
THAT NOT DISPATCH BILL. I WON

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:33.562
THE MOST RELIABLE ENERGY

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.130
SOURCES WE HAVE. WE SAW PROOF

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.231
OF IT FROM BC IN. BRITISH

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.567
COLUMBIA- WASHINGTON DC WENT TO

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:39.568
CANADA IT WORKS IN ALL THOSE

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.270
COUNTRIES. THEY'RE NOT HAVING

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.105
GROWING POLLUTION BECAUSE OF

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.539
USING HIGH HYDRO WHICH WAS ONE

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:46.174
OF THE CLEANEST SOURCES AROUND.

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.809
BUT WE BECOME HYPOCRITES AS

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.912
LEGISLATORS WHEN WE CONTINUE TO

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:52.581
PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS THIS

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.883
HOUSE VALUE WE SHOULD BE. ADDED

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.285

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:59.221
BE COUNTY TOWARD- OUR OUR PS A

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.523
REQUIREMENT JUST LIKE ROOFTOP

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.158
SOLAR SHOULD BE COUNTED BUT IF

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:05.394
WE COUNTED THAT. WOULD WELL BE

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.895
CAST 60% WOULD BE WELL ON OUR

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:08.063
WAY TO. RENO WHEN PROJECT BUT

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.097
WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.500
WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD MORE

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:13.468
MORE. RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:16.138
