MISTER CHAIR GERMAN AND- CENTER MAKOWSKI- THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US IN THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AS PRESENTED IN THE ANALYSIS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON THOSE. AMENDMENTS AS ODD MISTER CHAMBERS YOU AND I HAVE. DISCUSSED WE ARE WINDING- WE MAY GET SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK FROM UC OR CSU OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE FUTURE IF THEY HAVE ANY CONCERNS WE WILL ASK THEM TO ENGAGE WITH THE COMMITTEE- BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THESE ARE AMENDMENTS. ON ARE CALLING SIDE SPEEDY SEX IS THE STUDENT FACULTY HOUSING ACT. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HELP US ADDRESS THE PROFOUND. LACK OF STUDENT AND FACULTY HOUSING- IN OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS PERVASIVE AND- THE STUDENTS. ARE PART OF THAT CRISIS- ALTHOUGH. THE ARE YOU SINCE SYSTEMS ARE HAVE ADDED NEARLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND BEDS FOR STUDENTS SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN- EMISSIONS INCREASES HAVE FAR OUTPACED BY THE GROWTH IN HOUSING. AND IT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE STUDENTS AND MORE STUDENTS ARE- ARE ARE. BEING PART OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING FOR THEM AND WE NEED TO GIVE OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THE TOOLS TO PROVIDE THAT HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE NOTE THAT- IN AS OF THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ONE THIRTEEN CSU CAMPUSES WE HAD EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS ON WAIT LISTS FOR HOUSING- AT UC CAMPUSES THEY REPORTED- SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE UNDER A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED. STUDENTS ON A WAITING LIST FOR HOUSING WHICH OF THOSE TWO- SYSTEMS A COMBINED TOTAL OF OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO WERE UNABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO STUDENT HOUSING. I AM IS TOO HUGE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ARE THESE WAIT LISTS DON'T TRUST- PUSH STUDENTS TO PRIVATE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. FIVE GOOD MINISTERS CAN AFFORD THAT OPTION SO WE EITHER HAVE STUDENTS GOING INTO THE GENERAL HOUSING POOL AND THAT CAN COOK PRESSURES ON THOSE ON THAT HOUSING- A POOL- WORDS DALY IF WE BECOME HOMELESS OR HOUSING INSECURE OF ELEVEN IN TEMPORARY MOTELS. WHERE THEY COUNTY SERVER THEY LIVE IN THEIR CARS- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE R. L. A. O. REPORTED THAT 5% OF YOU SEE STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY. HOMELESSNESS WHEN WE ARRIVE AT IN THOSE LIVING IN MOTELS TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AT SIXTEEN PERCENT. FOR CSU STUDENTS THE RATE OF HOMELESSNESS- IS. ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE. A NINETY SERVE OF FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CAN COLLEGE STUDENTS I FOUND THAT 90% OF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN HOMELESS AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST YEAR WELL 60% HAD EXPERIENCED HOUSING INSECURITY. THE HOUSING SHORTAGE RELATING TO OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT STUDENTS IT'S ALSO ABOUT. OUR FACULTY FACULTY YOU SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE COLLEGE CAMPUS. UNDER PUSH IN THE LONG COMMUTES THUS INCREASING- THEIR OWN STRESS LEVELS REDUCING THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS ON TEACHING- AND INCREASING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSIONS ARE WITH THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE. ARE WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS FACULTY HOUSING- ON CAMPUS- SO- SB EIGHTY SIX WILL HELP ADDRESS THIS CRISIS- OUR BODIES STREAMLINING HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY ON YOUR CITY LAND- IT ARE BY- OF REMOVING THESE PROJECTS FROM SEACROFT. AND INSURING THAT THEY ARE NOT STOCKTON ANALYSTS LITIGATION AND APPEALS ONE OF THE CLERKS SICK WAS NOT THE ONLY ISSUE. WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT HOUSING- WE NEED MORE FUNDING WE NEED- BETTER PLANNING BY OUR OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. I SERVICE- IS NOT A SILVER BULLET THERE ARE VERY FEW SILVER BULLETS AND LYFT. THIS IS ONE WAY TO ACCELERATE THE APPROVAL WE HAVE WE ARE INCREASING OUR BUDGET INVESTMENT AS SOON HOUSING WE DID A LOT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE'VE INCREASED OUR INVESTMENT WE'RE GOING IN. THERE I HOPE. ONE TO DEPLOY FUNDING HOW QUICK. I SO I RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR VOTE I'M A COMMITTED TO TESTIFY. CAUSING HIM- WHO IS- THE TRANSFER STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICE AND VICE CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. WITH THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION ONE OF OUR ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AND DR JAMES MARTELL A PROFESSOR AND JOHN CALIPARI FACULTY ASSOCIATION CHAPTER PRESIDENT. AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY SEE IF THERE'S ANOTHER CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AND THEN ON MARCH THIRD OCT CO SPONSOR- THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES- IS PRESENT- THROUGH GERMANY. THEN ANY OCT- RELATING TO SOME OF THE LABOR PROVISIONS. IN THE BILL THANK YOU. THE REASON PERCENT. YEAH OKAY. AFTERNOON CHALLENGED AND- SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE AND ANYONE WHO IS ON THE TELECONFERENCE MY NAME'S TARGETS HUMAN ON THE VICE CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND THE TRANSITION AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION I'M INTERESTED NOT UC DAVIS FROM TV COLLEGE AND I CURRENTLY LIVE IN AN ON CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING COMPLEX THAT WAS A TARGET OF THIS. LAWSUIT DURING ITS DEVELOPMENT. THE ONGOING COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC I HAVE NEVER VISITED UC DAVIS UNTIL THE END OF MY FIRST YEAR AS A STUDENT. WHICH WAS ENTIRELY ONLINE. AROUND DECEMBER WHEN IT WAS LIKELY THAT UC DAVIS RETURNING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THE FOLLOWING FALL. I STARTED MY SEARCH FOR HOUSING I DECIDED TO ASK MY FRIENDS FOR ADVICE AND HE TOLD ME GOOD LUCK. AND I SHOULD HAVE STARTED SEARCHING LAST SEPTEMBER. WHEN I LIVED IN OFF CAMPUS HOUSING THE PRICES AND COMPETITION FOR THEM WERE UNBELIEVABLE. I WAS STRESSED ABOUT WHERE I WOULD BE LIVING IN A CITY WHERE I ONLY KNEW A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE. BUT THEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE NEW CAMPUS VILLAGE IS THE LARGEST IN HOUSING PROJECT UNITED STATES. WITH THIRTY THREE HUNDRED BEDS ACROSS THIRTY FOUR ACRES AND IS PRIMARILY ORIENTED TOWARDS TRANSFER STUDENTS LIKE ME. AS THE NAME SUGGESTS ENVIRONMENT SUSTAINABILITY WAS CENTRAL TO THIS PROJECT AND HAS AN ANNUAL GOAL OF 1100% NET ZERO ENERGY USE. LIKE OTHER STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS PROJECT BASIS PEOPLE LOST YOUR ATTENTION DELAY THE CONSTRUCTION PLANS. THE LAWSUIT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL BUT IF THE PROJECT HAD BEEN DELAYED I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES I HAVE TODAY. FOR DECADES ENTICING COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE WEAPONIZED SEE WHAT'S HOT THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING PROJECTS INCLUDING STUDENT PORTAL HOUSING. SB EIGHT EIGHT SIX FOR EXAMPLE ON CAMPUS STUDENT FACULTY HOUSING FROM SYKORA RECOGNIZING THAT THESE HOUSING PROJECTS TYPICALLY RESULT IN LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BECAUSE THEY ALLOW STUDENTS. TO RESIDE NEAR THE CAMPUSES INSTEAD OF COMMUTER SCHOOL EVERY DAY. I'M GRATEFUL TO BE LIVING IN ON CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY THERE ARE MULTIPLE BUS ROUTES IN THE COMPLEX MAKING IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO GET AROUND THE CITY% IN CLASSES. WHICH IS GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CAR. IT IS EASIER TO SUCCEED PERSONALLY AND ACADEMICALLY WHEN YOU LIVE ON CAMPUS HOWEVER THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ONLY CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO SELECT GROUPS OF STUDENTS AND THOSE WHO LIVE ON CAMPUS OR CONSERVE THE LUCKY ONES. THERE'S AN EXTREME SHORTAGE OF STUDENTS FACULTY HOUSING AT THREE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. THE UC'S ONLY HAVE BEDS 435% OF STUDENTS AND CSU HAVE 14% WE MUST DO BETTER. ONLY ELEVEN OF THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN FISCAL COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA PROVIDE HOW. HOW LONG THE CITY COLLEGE A PILOT PROGRAM HAS BEEN LAUNCHED FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS SLEEP IN THEIR CARS IN PARKING LOTS OVERNIGHT. SANTA MONICA COLLEGE'S BILL EXPLORING BUILDING HOUSING. FOR HOMELESS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING. ABOUT PROJECT WERE DELAYED BECAUSE OF A CIVIL LAWSUIT. THE STATUS IF THE STATE OF STUDENT FACULTY HOUSING IS A DISASTER PROVIDING FUNDING TO BUILD HOUSING IS NOT ENOUGH. WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS FOR THE HOUSING TO ACTUALLY CONSTRUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER. WELL S. B. EIGHTY SIX WILL NOT COMPLETELY ERADICATE THE HOUSING SHORTAGE WILL STREAMLINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR OUR STUDENTS AND THE HARDWORKING FACULTY TO EDUCATE THEM.

OKAY I THINK YOU CHAIR NUMBERS MY NAME'S JENNIFER CANNOT AND THEN THE SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT OR CD CD EVEN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION THAT ORGANIZES AND WORKS ALONGSIDE COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES WELLINGTON EAST OAKLAND AND RICHMOND. WELL. TO REMEMBER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. PHOEBE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SB EIGHT EIGHT SIX THIS BILL WOULD EXEMPT HOUSING PROJECTS BY PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND PUBLIC CONCEPTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. WE APPRECIATE THE OFFICE STAFF AND THE BILL'S SPONSORS FOR TAKING THE TIME WITH US. TO DISCUSS THE CONCERN HOWEVER REMAIN TROUBLED BY THE HARMFUL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THIS BILL WOULD CREATE VULNERABLE PUBLICLY. THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE REAL BARRIERS TO CREATING ADEQUATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS. TO PROMOTE A DANGEROUS FALSE NARRATIVE THAT SEEK WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. SEQUEL TO ONE OF THE FEW LEGAL TOOLS THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE. TO ENSURE THAT NEW PROJECT WILL NOT BRING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ANOTHER IMPACT. AS NOTING THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS SEE FOR EXEMPTIONS OVERLOOK THE BENEFITS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IF YOU. WOULD JUST CHEN FORMALIZATION MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT PROJECT IMPACT IDENTIFY WAYS TO AVOID OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC REASON HE LINE AGENCY APPROVED THE PROJECT SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL COMPACTORS IDENTIFY. AND INCREASE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND FIND COST. THE FORTY PROCESS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TAKE MOVIES TO LEARN ABOUT PARTICIPATE IN AND IMPROVE THESE PROJECTS THAT WILL LIKELY IMPACT THEIR FAMILY'S HEALTH AND THEIR ABILITY TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. HE ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROWING HOUSING CRISIS FOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THE BILL MISTAKENLY TARGET SEQUENCE THE PROBLEM AND DOES NOT ADDRESS THE REAL BARRIERS CREATING MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY. IT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN US TIME AND AGAIN THE PREQUEL EDUCATION IS OFTEN GROSSLY MISSTATED AND ONLY ABOUT WAS OPENED BY THE CASE. REAL SOLUTION FOR THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS TO LOOK AT THE ABSENT PLANNING AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL. REFORMING THE PROCESS FOR OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY pDEVELOPMENT PLAN IT HELPS PREVENT SIMILAR SITUATION HAPPENED FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY THE LACK OF AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS. CAN EXACERBATE A PATTERN OF MARKET REDEVELOPMENT THAT DRIVES UP COSTS FOR THE SURROUNDING AREA DIRECTLY DISPLACING VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB SIX. AND URGED COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO VOTE NO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOU VERY MUCH AND IF YOU COULD STAY ON THE LINE AND TO BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS OR HER OR HEARD A DISCUSSION READY PROJECT THAT. I'M AT DILLON HERE PERSON WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS OR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL YES YES MA'AM. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALLIANCE- REGISTERING OPPOSITION ALIGNING WITH CP- ALSO REGISTERING FOR LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE YOU ON THE PHONE LINES. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION OF SB EIGHT EIGHT THANK YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ADMITTED ONE EMINENT FEAR OF YOUR OPPOSITION. WE DO HAVE ONE QUEUING UP ONE MOMENT WHERE WE GIVE THEIR LINE NUMBER. AGAIN THIS IS OPPOSITION. OF SB EIGHT EIGHT SIX. AND WE WILL GO TO THE LINE UP FOR TWENTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. FEVERS REPRESENTING THE CITY OF THE LEADER- APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHORS DOING THE CANDY OF. THE BILL BUT WISH TO POINT OUT THAT NOT ALL DORMS ARE CREATED EQUAL HE- TO BE ABLE TO LET IS FACING THE STORM THAT WOULD BE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED BEDS IN A SINGLE BUILDING. NOT YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF ROOMS SPREAD OUT OVER MULTIPLE BUILDINGS BUT IN ONE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS- SEQUEL REVIEW WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR PROJECT OF THAT SIZE SO THEY WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO. A COMIC NUMBER SIX IN THE ANALYSIS IF YOU'LL BE SO KIND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY. AT PRESENT THERE MR KERRY HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN KIEL OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING THE BILL BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION QUESTIONS. I KNOW THAT OUR OUR TERMS LIKE TO. GAUGE WELL NOW. I THINK THE STAFF REPORT DOES A WONDERFUL JOB OF. OF ADDRESSING THIS FALSE NARRATIVE THAT SEAQUEST SOMEHOW THE EVIL OF WHY WE DON'T HAVE STUDENT HOUSING WHICH IS I HOPE PEOPLE READ IT AND YOU KNOW IT IS STILL. PERCENT OF THE OF IT. OF THE- OF THE- WHAT CONSERVING FALL THAT OUR CALL BACK SURE ARE FILED TO ACTUALLY GO INTO A LAWSUIT BUT WHEN I WE REVIEW TO STAFF REPORT ON THE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS YOU KNOW SME OF THE STUDENT HOUSING THAT'S ANTICIPATED YOU KNOW FEELS INTO AN INFILL PROJECT FOR RESIDENTIAL PRODUCT PROJECTS THAT ARE IN- BEEN- AND REALIZE COUNTY AREAS. AS THE AUTHOR JUST REMINDED ME THAT THAT PROJECT THAT MONSTROSITY IS COULD BE BUILT AT UC SANTA BARBARA WENT THROUGH SEEK WHAT THANK GOD APPROVED I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU MAY COMPLAIN ABOUT FORTY FOUR HUNDRED UNIT BUT IT WENT THROUGH SEQUEL AND GOT APPROVED. I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS THE- A SITUATION WHERE TAG YOU'RE IT IT'S NICE TO CARPABOUT STUDENTS TO NOT POLLUTANTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT. IS GOING ON BUT REALLY UC BERKELEY WHICH UNDER THE CHAIR AND I ATTENDED AT ONE TIME IS REALLY. A CULPRIT HERE IN IN IN FORCING SOME LAWSUITS BY NOT UPDATING YOUR LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT PLANS TONIGHT I HOPE ALL THE STUDENTS IN THE TRADES THAT HAVE CALLED IN TODAY. GO TO THE UC'S AND PARTICIPATE IN THEIR LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT PLANS BECAUSE- I WAS SURPRISED. HAPPY HAPPY THAT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND BEDS HAVE BEEN. BEEN BUILT THAT'S IT THAT'S OTHER. GREAT TO THE CSU AND UC SYSTEM NOT. NEARLY A SNUFF IF WE GOT SIXTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ON. VARIOUS CAMPUSES ARE ARE ARE UNDER HOUSE THE AMENDMENTS. MERE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT INTO THE NOW PUBLICIZE YOU KNOW YOU SEE. RICKLY THING WHERE THE FIFTEEN YEAR. MASTER PLAN FOR LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE UPDATE I'VE APPLIED THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN IT'S TAG YOU'RE IT YOU SEE YOU GUYS YOU KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE IN SEVEN YEARS AFTER THIS IS THIS BILL EXPIRES AND HAVE NO STUDENT HOUSING CRISIS YOU SEE SINCE ISSUES HAVEN'T GOTTEN THEIR ACT TOGETHER ON DOING IT SO- I'M GONNA SUPPORTED BALLOT. IN IOWA- A PUNCHING BAG FOR SOME PEOPLE TO SAY THIS IS THE PLACE FOR THIS THIS IS THE SOURCE OF ALL EVIL BUT I THINK. THE EXEMPTIONS THAT THEIR EXISTING NOW FIT NICELY INTO THE TONE OF WHAT WE ALREADY LOOK AT IT EXISTING PROJECT PROJECTS AND IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR ANTICIPATES WITH THE STUDENT HOUSING. BUILT AROUND- OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES TODAY SO PLEASE UC AND CSU SPEND SOME WORK ON YOUR LONG TERM PLANS. S. N. WHAT THAT- CLOSE TO THE ACT I GUESS IT'S ON THE TOPIC THAT IS A QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN YES AFTER ON SO IN TURN IN TERMS OF THE MARKET AND THE REASON I MENTION THE MUNGER PROJECTS I'VE AND FOR THE CITY OF ALEDO TELL YOUR YOUR SENATORS CENTER ALONE HAS BEEN EXTREME A STRONG ADVOCATE OF FOR YOU AND TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE MUNGER PROJECT AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU SEE SANTA BARBARA SO SHE IS VERY FOCUSED ON BEING AN EXCELLENT REPRESENTATIVE AS ALWAYS. ON BUT THE- RIGHT THE POINT WAS THAT THE MUNGER. PROJECTS WENT TO SEE WHAT AND STILL. GOT APPROVED TO THE- SO FOR THOSE WHO THINK. THE CITY OF THE LEADER THAT WE NEED TO GO TO FIGHT PROJECTS TO FIGHT A HORRIBLE PROJECT WITH THE MUNGER PROJECT. HE COULDN'T EVEN FIGHT EXTENDED IN TAKING A MUCH LONGER TO GET. APPROVED BUT ULTIMATELY GOT APPROVED. AND THAT'S ALSO THE OTHER PIECE HERE- AND I KNOW THAT THESE DEBATES HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND MISS COMMITTEE AND I'M NOT GOING TO IN A SENSE PRETEND LIKE I KNOW MORE THAN THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. WHAT I DO KNOW ESPECIALLY FOR MY TIME AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS YES IT MAY BE THAT ONLY 2% OF PROJECTS. THAT SUIT ON THE SEQUEL. BUT THAT IS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG BECAUSE- WHAT WHAT THE IMPACT THAT SEQUENCE I AM I DON'T. I'M NOT GONNA DEMONISE SECRECY WITH A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. BUT FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE REQUIREMENTS THE MOBILE WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS TO PROCESS ALL TO ME. WITH EARTH OR DIE. THEIR NEVER GETS SUED A DOG. OR MAD. IN THE- YOU'RE NEVER. PROCESS UNDERSEA QUAFF. ON AND UNDER LOCAL DISCRETIONARY PROCESSES. AND EVERYTHING. GET STELLAR AROUND TRYING TO AVOID A LAWSUIT- THERE ARE OTHER EXEMPTIONS BUT WE KNOW THAT THOSE DON'TALWAYS APPLY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE BEEN IN YORK'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF SICKLE LITIGATION AROUND STUDENT HOUSING I DO APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT SENATOR AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT. I WILL OF COURSE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS YEAH AND MR THE OPPOSITION'S POINT ABOUT THE SEQUEL OF PROVIDING A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW MANY OF TE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN TODAY IN THE TRADES LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD WE KNOW THAT THE BILL REQUIRES AT LEAST ONE PUBLIC HEARING. AND WE HOPE THAT THE U. SEASON THIS YEAR IF YOU GET THE MESSAGE THAT THERE'S A THERE'S VALUE IN HAVING INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THE CITY AND THEN THE STUDENTS AND IN THE TRACE WHOEVER WANTS TO COMMENT ON WHAT THE PROJECT IS IN ITS ITS- YOU KNOW JOIN THE- THE- THE TABLE WHERE DOES THESE TEN THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE. ARE OPEN AND EXPLAINED WHAT THE PROJECT IS WHAT THEY THINK THE DEFECTS COULD BE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AGAIN. SOMETHING AN IMPROVEMENT. YEAH MEAN THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT- AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO- REQUIRED LEED PLATINUM WHICH I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE. OF WINDOWLESS. DORM LIKE THE ONE THAT WAS APPROVED TO SEE WHO AT THE END.

THANK YOU OKAY LET'S LET'S CALL UP FROM CENTER MCGUIRE WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT ITEM FOR IN YOUR CHEN IS THIS SB. NINE SEVENTY EIGHT. CENTER YOU MAY PRESUME RIGHT. WHERE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH OF FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO CHEER ALLEN INTO HIS TREMENDOUS STAFF FOR ALL THEIR EFFORT ON THIS BILL SB NINE SEVENTY EIGHT LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS- WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW ON HOW CALIFORNIA CAN IMPLEMENT THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WILDFIRE DEBRIS REMOVAL PROGRAM. IN THE NATION. IN JUST LIKE CENTER DOLLY SCENE SEASON. AFTER SEASONAFTER SEASON WE'VE SEEN THE SAME THING ON THE NORTH COAST IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. NEARLY THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES BURNED. IN TRYING TO BE ABLE TO MOBILIZE TO BE ABLE TO GET OUR COMMUNITY'S CLEAN UP AND REBUILD. IN WHAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD DO IS ONE THAT PUTS THE NEEDS OF NEIGHBORS WHO LOST EVERYTHING FROM WILDFIRES FIRST IT DELIVERS FOR COMMUNITIES IN THEIR REBUILDING PLAN. AND ENSURES TAXPAYERS SEE THE MASSIVE CLEANUP PROJECTS FINISH SAFELY ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING A NEW NORMAL FOURTEEN THE LARGEST TWENTY WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE LAST DECADE. AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE STOPPING ANYTIME SOON WHICH MEANS CALIFORNIANS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WILL REMAIN IN DANGER. AND WITH EACH OF THESE DISASTERS FIRES THOUSANDS OF LIVELIHOODS ARE OFFENDED. IN WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AND WHAT EACH OF YOU KNOW IN OUR BUDGET SUB TO CHEER KNOWS IS THAT. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A RECOVERY IS THIS MOVES. RE CLEAN UP PROCESS. THROUGH S. B. NINE SEVEN EIGHT STREAMLINES AND ENHANCES THE PROCESS FOR WATER CLEAN UP RECOVERY CONTRACTS LIKE TO WALK THROUGH THE POINTS AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO. CATCH FOLKS UP ON WHERE WE BEEN OUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. THE BILL REQUIRES CAR RECYCLE TO ESTABLISH A PRE QUALIFIED LIST OF CONTRACTORS WHO CAN BE DEPLOYED ANYTIME. WITH THEIR STAFF TEAMS TO BEGIN COMMUNITY CLEANUPS THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE FEMA PROGRAM HAS. ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THIRTY SET A STANDARDS HERE TO STATE THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ESTABLISH WHAT CONTRACTORS WE NEED IN ORDER TO BECOME PRE QUALIFIED SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BILL REQUIRE CONTRACTORS HAVE PROPER LICENSING. EMPLOYEE SAFETY TRAINING THAT'S CALLED HAS WHOPPER- IN THE IT TAKES ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO BE ABLE. TO COMPLETE THE MUSON ROLE WITH THE DEPARTMENT INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTRACTORS WE NEED TO HAVE A- RECORD OF SAFE WORK PERFORMANCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD ENSURE THE AWARDED GENERAL CONTRACTOR PERFORM ABOUT 30% OF THE WORK THEMSELVES. IN WORK WITH A REGISTERED APPRENTICE PROGRAM WHICH CREATES A PATHWAY TO SKILLED JOBS. NOW WE ALSO BELIEVE CONTRACTORS SHOULD BE QUICK PREQUALIFIED FOR HAZARDOUS TREE REMOVAL. AS WELL AS DEBRIS CLEANUP. NOW I WANT TO GET TO THE NEXT STEP INTO A CATCH UP ON WHERE WE'VE BEEN OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE FULL DISCLOSURE THE GOOD FOLKS THE GOOD FOLKS AT CAL RECYCLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ESTABLISHING THIS PROCESS OF PRE QUALIFIED. THE PROCESS IS WELL. IT WOULD ESTABLISH A PRE QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR LIST. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS INVESTED IN AN ENTIRE NEW DEPARTMENT AT CAL RECYCLE- THAT IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON DEBRIS REMOVAL. NOW WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL PROCESS IN GETTING PRE QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS WELL I CAN NEVER SPEAK FOR THE AGENCY OR THE ADMINISTRATION. I CAN NEVER SPEAK FOR THEM- WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AS WE HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS- TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS DEAL LANDED. AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF MY PRESENTATION THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS IN FACT WE HAD OUR LATEST MEETING AT EIGHT THIRTY THIS MORNING. MEMBERS ARE GONNA SEE REFINEMENTS TO THE BILL AS THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES TO SPEEDING UP THE CLEAN UP PROCESS ONE THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVE. OTHER IS LEGISLATIVELY AND I CAN I CAN PROMISE EACH OF YOU TODAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE COMPLEMENTARY. I'M IN AGAIN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR TWO YEARS NOW FOR THE WORKING WITH THEM IN THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAD BEEN AT THE TO. THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THE USE OF THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED WORKFORCE IS AVAILABLE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DELIVERING PROJECTS ON TIME WORK IS PERFORMED IN A SAFE MANNER AND THAT THE BEST- IN IT. AND WE ALSO ARE ABLE TO PROTECT WORKERS. CONTRACTORS HAVE EXPERIENCE DOING THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK IN OUR COMMUNITIES I WITH ME TODAY TIM CRIMMINS WITH THE OPERATING ENGINEERS AS WELL AS ERIN HAYNES THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SOME COMMENTS IN SUPPORT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ANY CONVERSATION RESEARCHER. MISTER CRIMMINS DURING THE FIRST. A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TEMPERAMENTS ARE PRETTY GENEROUS OF CO SPONSOR THE BILL ALONG WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES I THINK THIS BILL IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD A PRE QUALIFICATION HAITIAN OF CONTRACTORS ALLOWS US TO ANTICIPATE WORKFORCE NEEDS TRAINING NEEDS- THESE ARE HIGHLY UNSTABLE HAZARDOUS WORK ENVIRONMENTS. MYERS EXTRA TRAINING A UNIQUE TYPE OF WORKER A WORKER FAMILIAR WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY ON ON HAZMAT REMOVAL AND THIS WILL IT HELP US ANTICIPATE THOSE NEEDS. AND ALL AND ALSO- A CONTRACTOR KNOWLEDGE OF WITH KNOWLEDGE OF HIS LABOR REQUIREMENTS- AS EVIDENCED BY HAVING TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL AT THE STATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND WHIMS LINE GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN- ERIN LEE HANNA WE HAVE THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- HERE'S YOUR WITNESS. ABOUT A YEAR- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE I CAN SAY THIS IS YOU KNOW- SADLY A VERY UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND- THIS BILL- WILL SERVE.

AND WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION IQ AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH ARE LET'S BRING THEM BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRED FOR BRINGS FOR I JUST WANT TO. I KNOW THAT YOU SAID THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS LOOK I. KNOW NO QUALMS WITH SOME. SKILLED LABOR AND ALL THAT BUT- I'VE I HAD- PARADISE AND ALSO- GREENVILLE AND OBVIOUSLY TOO MANY MY COMMUNITIES AS AS WELL AS YOU HAD THOSE SAME ISSUES IN YOUR COMMUNITIES AND- WE'VE LEARNED A LOT WE LEARNED A LOT THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW. WHEN WE PERCENT SO PARADISE OBVIOUSLY WHAT WAS OF MOST. UNBELIEVABLE SCENE IF YOU LOOK LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB WENT OFF THERE AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CONTAMINANTS IN A LOT OF THE THINGS HAPPEN SO NUMBER ONE YOU COMMUNITY GETS DESTROYED. NUMBER TWO- YES COMES IN AND THEN. THEY BRING FEDERAL DOLLARS AND UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND YOU BRING IN CONTRACTORS RATHER SEE YOUR COMMUNITY JUST GOT HIT THEN YOUR CONTRACTORS IN YOUR LOCAL AREA. YEAH HAMMERED BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET TO WORK SO USE A DOUBLE WHAMMY. ON YOUR COMMUNITY AND SO IN THESE VERY. IS SO IN POPULATED AREAS WE HAVE THE WORKFORCE WE QUITE BRING WE HAVE THE SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE AND SOMETIMES. AND LIKE GREENVILLE LET'S TAKE FOR EXAMPLE GREENVILLE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A HALL THERE. I KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER SKILLED WORKFORCE ARE. NOT TO LEVEL SO I WANT YOU TO BE CAUGHT I WANT YOU TO BE IT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT I'M SURE YOU DO. THERE'S GOT TO BE AWARE THAT WE DON'T HAMMER THE LOCAL CONTRACTORS AND THE COMMUNITY ARE THEY LOST OUR COMMUNITY IN SECOND WHEN THEY DON'T ANY WORK. SO THAT'S HOURS WERE BRING A CONCERN UP BECAUSE IT'S REAL AND IT HAPPENS. THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS TO IS- ON THE RECYCLING SIDE OF IT WE SAW WE SAW- THE CONTRACTOR THAT GOT THE BID IN. IN PARADISE- WASN'T A LOCAL GUY AND THEY ACTUALLY TRUCK THE STEP FURTHER BECAUSE- CONTRACT GOT THE- I COST THE- COST MORE MONEY AND IT ALSO HURT A LOCAL CONTRACTOR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THEY DON'T GET TO LAY DOWN SO I JUST WANNA SAY THERE THAT IS SOUNDS GOOD ON IN THE BILL AND I I'M GONNA I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I WANT I WANT YOU AS IT GOES FORWARD THERE HAS TO BE. ABILITY TO HELP MAKE THE COMMUNITY HOLE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LOST EVERYTHING IF THEY HAVE THE SKILLS AND THEY HAVE THE IN THE FACILITIES TO DO IT. RIGHT THIRD HERE VETERANS PLEASE YOU I'M AND I WILL SOMETIMES GET CHOKED UP ABOUT IT AND I APOLOGIZE JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. IT'S BEEN AWFUL. SEEN YEAR AFTER YEAR SO MANY COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT'S IN SIR DOLLARS ECHO THE WORDS ARE ON THE NORTH COAST SO MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEVELED. AND WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT WE WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS REALITY THAT WE'RE ALL FACING RIGHT NOW. SO THERE BEEN THREE THAT'S RIGHT THINK THAT WE SHOULD TAKE AND- CANDIDLY THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF. CARE BY CASKEY- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THERE ON TO THE STEPS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST. WE LEARN A LOT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AFTER THE VALLEY FIRE TORE THROUGH MIDDLETOWN. AND BURNED DOWN ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOMES. IT DESTROYED CAL RECYCLE THERE WAS NO INTERNAL DEPARTMENT THAT WAS FOCUSED ON DEBRIS AND WE HAD TO BE A REBUILD IT FROM THE GROUND UP. AND IT WAS A STATE SPONSORED PROJECTS THE OF TWO DIFFERENT PROJECTS WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN UP DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE FIRE RIGHT STATE AND OR FEDERAL. SO IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WAS STATE WE LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL INTERNAL ACCOUNT RECYCLE. THANKS TO THE DIRECTION OF DIRECTOR WAGNER. AND THAT MAY SEEM LEADERSHIP I'VE JEREMIH CASKEY THEY ARE NEARLY FULLY STAFFED WITH AN INTERNAL DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE FLIPPING DO IS TO BRING. DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL. AND THEY COORDINATE WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AT THE TABLE WHEN WE'VE BEEN HAVING THESE MEETINGS HAS BEEN. INFORMALLY OF COURSE HAS BEEN CONTRACTORS HAS BEEN CARRY CYCLE HAS BEEN- YES WE TRY TO WORK THROUGH THE CHALLENGES THAT- CENTER DOLLY HAS JUST ADDRESSED. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TO A STEP TWO WE GOTTA GET OR PRE QUALIFIED LIST THIS IS CRAZY WE'RE BRINGING IN LARGE CONTRACTORS FROM FLORIDA. I TO COME DO THE WORK. AND THEN THEY SCRAMBLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE QUALIFIED WORKFORCE SO WHAT WE DID IN MIDDLETOWN AND OFFERING JUNIORS CAN TALK ABOUT THIS IS THEY ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE STATE OFF THE MERCY SERVICES WERE ABLE TO HIRE A LITTLE LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE ACTUAL CLEANUP WORK FORCE. FROM THE COUNTY. FROM THE CAP YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TWO WEEKS CERTIFICATION HAS WHOPPER TRAINING THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE UNDER THIS PLAN WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET MORE FOLKS BACK TO WORK AND WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST BECAUSE THESE FOLKS HAVE LOST LITERALLY EVERYTHING. IN OUR LIFE. SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT. THE THIRD ITEM I WOULD JUST SAY IS- WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. WE HAVE TO GET- TREES OUT PLUS WE HAVE TO GET DEBRIS OUT AND SO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A PRE QUALIFICATION. I CALL A CONTRACTOR COULD BE QUALIFY FOR BOTH OR IT COULD BE QUALIFIED FOR ONE OF THE OTHER. IS THAT ANY OTHER PIECE I'M JUST BEING REALLY TRANSPARENT WITH YOU CENTER DOLLY. WE ARE NOT FOCUSING ON THE RECYCLING IN WITHIN THIS BUT SIMPLY ON GROUP DEBRIS REMOVAL AND I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON THIS CASE. YOUR OPINION IS HE YOU HAVE IS CREEK SO. IN THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. OR BUILDING YEAH. PARADISE CAR FIRE REDDING YEAH GREEN BILL LAST YEAR FOR MAJOR EVENTS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE GETTING A LOT BETTER AT THE RESPONSE I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE TIME FROM. ORVILLE PARADISE TO LAST YEAR- YES CARRY CYCLE THEY WERE ALL ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE FIRE WAS EVEN PUT OUT. A BEFORE WE LOS GREENVILLE THEY WERE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP MITIGATE SO WE HAVE MOVED MOUNTAINS IN COORDINATION AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT BUT THERE HAS TO BE COORDINATION FOR IT'S NOT JUST. TREE REMOVAL IT IS IT IS THE CALORIE CYCLE GOING TO BE THERE TOO AND WE HAVE TO THE CONTRACTORS DO THAT AS WELL SO THAT THAT BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT AT IN THIS PROCESS. I'M I'M GONNA BE HELPFUL BUT I DON'T WANNA LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITIES EITHER. TOTALLY AGREE AND- I NEVER WANT TO BE COREY. WHEN I SAY THERE'S A WORK IN PROGRESS WE REALLY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR TWO YEARS. I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE- THE DEPARTMENT MOVES IN THE COMING. FEW MONTHS ON A PRE QUALIFIED LIST THIS IS ALL DONE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP. OF OBVIOUSLY GOVERNOR NEWSOM. IS WELL AS DIRECTOR WAGNER AND CAL RECYCLE SHE HAS BEEN AMAZING. I GOT TO SAY. AND WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE MARKER THE DUTY. AS DIRECTOR OF- YES BECAUSE THEY BECOME GOOD AT IT. NOW WE NEED TO BECOME. GREAT IN TURN THIS INTO A MODEL BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO WHAT WE HAD IN I'M- CENTER DIED BE HAPPY. IF YOU BE WILLING TO. ENGAGE ON THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I DON'T THINK YOU GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH CREDIT- I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO ADDRESS. SIX YEARS AGO SEVEN YEARS AGO ALL THE BIG FIRES WERE HANDLED BY FEMA BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THIS NARRATIVE OF. SOME GUY FROM FLORIDA COMING IN NOT RECYCLING STUFF NOT KNOWING THE LOCAL ALL THE LITTLE FIRES WERE. PRODUCTS OF- OF CAL RECYCLE AND EVEN THE LITTLE FIRES CAL RECYCLES. AND A- CHALLENGED THE LAST SIX YEARS THERE'S BEEN AN AGREEMENT WITH THE TO QUIT CAL RECYCLED AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN YOU. EXPLAIN WHERE WE'RE AT BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT THE EXTERNALITIES ARE ALSO A WORK IN PROGRESS OF WHERE WE'VE COME WITH IF WE HAVE A BIG FIRE COMING UP THIS YEAR HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE TREATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOUR UNDERSTANDING YEAH NO ABSOLUTELY SO RIGHT NOW- WHICH IS BEEN REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND I'M GONNA USE THE TUBBS FIRE FOR EXAMPLE. OF THE WAY THIS NEW MODEL HAS WORKED IS THAT YOU HAVE THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES DIRECTOR ON THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES DIRECTOR MARK OF THE DUTIES LITERALLY OVERSEEN. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- ROBERT FENTON WHOSE THAT I REGION NINE ADMINISTRATOR FOR FEMA ON CO MANAGEMENT OF THE ENTIRE DEBRIS REMOVAL. SO YOU HAVE US DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN. TERROR- EXCUSE ME I'M HERE BECAUSE HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND WHAT I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE A TO SEE GOING INTO THIS. IS THREE LEVELS OF DISASTER SMALL MEETING MARCH. RIGHT INTO YOU WOULD HAVE CONTRACTOR- IN THIS IS WHY STATE TO WORK IN PROGRESS BECAUSE THIS IS STILL BEING WORKED OUT. THAT WOULD BE THAT COULD QUALIFY FOR ALL OR QUALIFY FOR SOME OR QUALIFY FOR ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES. AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE GOING WITH THIS BUT- MR SENATORS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN REGARDS THE WAY WE CHANGE THIS THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THIS. ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IS WHEN WE HAD TO CHANGE CONTRACTORS MIDSTREAM FOR THE TUBBS FIRE YEAH. IT WAS AWFUL. IN ORDER TO GROW JUDE SHE BROUGHT A STATE. BENEFIT THE JOB WEEKS. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S THIS PRE QUALIFICATION THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I'M SORRY CENTER CASCADED NO NO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S GOOD I GUESS I DON'T LIKE TO GET TO THE SECOND PIECE BECAUSE- ONE PORSCHE ON. DEBRIS REMOVAL AND THIS IS TREE REMOVAL CAN YOU TALK I MEAN WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR THINKING ON BECAUSE WHEN THESE FIRES COME SOME OF THE TREES THAT NEED TO BE REMOVED ARE. OUTSIDE THE LIVEABLE AREA SOME OF OUR MARK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE NEIGHBOR'S TREE- HOW IS ACT HOW IS THAT APPROACHED. BY FOR YOUR VISION ON THIS- BY CAL RECYCLE I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO- PRE QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS FOR BOTH. ON AND ONE CONTRACTOR COULD DO BOTH OR JUST ONE BUT LOOK SO RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE IRE THAT COMES THROUGH. TYPICALLY AND I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL BUT I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHAT I'VE SEEN CRITICALLY YOU HAVE A LARGE AT TIMES MULTINATIONAL TECH. ALL THIS TO BE A- WHAT IF TO FACE OF REMOVAL YOU HAVE- WHERE I. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS IS THE REMOVAL AND THEN YOU GET RID OF ALL THE FOUNDATIONS AND THE REMAINDER OF THE CARS EXCEPT DR THEN YOU HAVE THE DEAD AND DYING TREES AND YOU REALLY HAVE A TREE OUTSIDE COMING IN ACTUALLY OF ALL THE EGGS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE EITHER DYING OR DEAD. SO JUST BEING HONEST WHERE I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THIS PLAY OUT IS IT THERE'LL BE TO PRE QUALIFIED LIST ONE FOR DEBRIS. ONE FOR TREES IN YOU'D HAVE TO SEPARATE LIST OF CONTRACTORS THAT WOULD NOT BE ON THAT PRE QUALIFIED THIS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE BUT AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO JUMP AHEAD OF MY SKIS BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THIS IS GOING TO END UP. THANK. OKAY MOVE THE BILL. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS FROM THE- FROM MEMBERS OKAY THANKS AND MOVED WILL GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE RESPECT FASTER. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TOM PLEASE. ITEM NUMBER FOUR S. B. NINE SEVEN EIGHT BY SENATOR REQUIRE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN. ALLEN AYE BATES. IT'S DOLLY AYE DADDY AYE GONZALEZ SKINNER STERN ALL RIGHT STERN HI MY COUNTY BY COUNTY I. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THINK CENTER. PART WILL ASK OUR CENTER HERTZBERG TO APPROACH THE DICE NOW TO PRESENT ITEMS TWO AND THREE YEAR GENESIS IS THE SB NINETY ONE NSP NINE EIGHTY NINE. ANYONE BUSINESS LIKE YES YOU'RE DOING NINE EIGHT NINETY ONE THIS IS THE- BUSINESS LICENSES STORMWATER DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE SURE YEP OKAY. THIS IS ONE OF THESE KINDS OF BILLS. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET LOW GOVERNMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WE WANT THEM TO GET HEIR PERMIT. THEIR INDUSTRIAL GENERAL PERMIT TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS OKAY. MAKES PRETTY SIMPLE WE PASSED THE BILL THINK ABOUT THIS HEY WE PASSED THE BILL AND WE TRIED TO USE THE BUSINESS LICENSE APPROACH TO BE ABLE TO THEN GATHER THE INFORMATION. AND THE SUCCESS TWO THOUSAND ENTITIES AND UP BUT GUESS WHAT. HOME LOCAL COMPANIES DON'T HAVE BUSINESS LICENSE THEIRBUSINESS CERTIFICATES AND IS IT THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO US. SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO NOW REWRITE THE LAW WE HAVE A NEW LAW SPEND ALL THIS MONEY OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN NOW SAY NOT JUST BUSINESS LICENSES BUT BUSINESS CERTIFICATES SO WE CAN GO AFTER HIM TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY WILL COMPLY WITH THE LAW THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AS THEY SAY IN YIDDISH- WALKING CARP YOU GOTTA HOLD YOUR HEAD. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME WITH THAT I GOT A VERY GOOD WITNESS HERE'S WHO'S BEEN WORKING WITH ME SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER SEAN BOTHWELL HER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHO'S BEEN WITH ME ALL THE WAY ON ALL OF THESE VARIOUS MEASURES OVER THE YEARS. IF YOU SEE. THANK YOU TERRY AND ERIC MEMBERS AND- SEVEN HERTZBERG- WE PASSED SB TWO OH FIVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. I WAS REALLY WE CAME UP WITH AN ELEGANT SOLUTION- US WORKING WITH PERMIT TEAS DOWN NEXT TO THE LA REGION. A CAME UP WITH THIS THIS CONCEPT- AND WE REALLY WANTED TO COMMIT TO MAKING SURE THAT- THAT IT WAS AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR BUSINESSES- AND THAT WE- ALSO STREAMLINED THE PROCESS. LOCAL GOD SO THAT IT WASN'T BURDEN UPON THEM- AND NOT BILL PASSED HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THANK YOU SENATORS- AND SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE ISSUES THAT HAVE POPPED UP- THE SENATOR BROUGHT UP THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE WHICH IS THERE'S CERTAIN CITIES AND- THROUGH THIS BILL WE'VE GOT TO DISCOVER THAT. THAT THEY'RE QUITE LARGE CITY SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES SAN JOSE. I HAVE BUSINESS CERTIFICATES INSTEAD OF BUSINESS LICENSES. BUT THE INTENT IS THE SAME. ARE THAT THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY PERMITTING OR ALLOWING A BUSINESS. WITH THEIR- I SAID YOU'RE BILL BUT ARE COMPLYING WITH LAW BECAUSE AREN'T IN. UNDER THIS INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT AND SO WE WANT TO FIX THAT ISSUE- THE SB TWO A FIVE YEAR ORIGINAL LAW IS WORKING WE HAVE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND NEW BUSINESSES THAT HAVE ENROLLED UNDER THIS INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMITS SINCE. SINCE IT WAS ADOPTED ITS ONLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO- COUPLE OTHER THINGS THE BILL DOES THAT'S IMPORTANT- SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PHARNACES. PROVIDING THE INFORMATION. IT WAS PROVIDED TO THEM FOR THEM TO GET THE BUSINESS LICENSE AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN FACILITIES THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE SHOULD A LICENSE BECAUSE THE GENERAL IN THE PERMIT. SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME TRANSPARENCY SO THE PUBLIC KNOWS WHAT THOSE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ARE. IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S JUST JUST OF A FOUR DIGIT CODE- THAT WE WANT TO BE PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE- NAME ADDRESS DATE WHICH IS ALREADY BEING REQUIRED- AND THEN LASTLY THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT IN. SAID THAT THEY WERE EXIST- PROBLEM FOR FROM THE PROCESS. AND THE- OVERSIGHT BY THE BOARDS TO GET ON TO THAT. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT SOME OF THE NEW PERMIT FEES ARE. FOR IT ACTION TO TURN POST TRUTH ARE. FROM PERMITS REQUIREMENTS- AND THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR FAIR PART. AND THEN LAST BUT JUST REALLY. TOTAL. YEAH BARMOUTH. INSTEAD SURE. BUSINESS ADDRESSING THEIR INDUSTRIALS POLLUTION. BUT IF IT'S NOT ADDRESS. THE POLLUTION AND RUNNING INTO THE- THE NEW- STORMWATER I KNOW THEY BECOME LIABLE FOR IT AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS WERE ALSO TRYING TO HELP THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS YOU OF THEIR OWN STORMWATER LIABILITY BY. ALL THE INDUST COASTS ARE ARE IN THE SAME BEEN PLAYING FIELD I WOULD COMES TO COMPLY WITH THE PERMIT SO. WITH THAT I ANSWERED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S GO TO ON THE PHONE LINES TO SEE- SORRY SOON AS A PERSON ONE TO RAISE. THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. OKAY PHONE LINES ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES YOU WANT TO. VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR SB EIGHT NINETY ONE. IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB BE EIGHT NINETY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S WHAT AND THEN THERE ARE FEWER PARTS.

FOR ANY OPPOSITION THAT IS THE ONE AND THEN ZERO. WE HAVE NOT THANK YOU AT THE FRONT MITCHELL K. LET'S GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS. SENATOR STERN. THAN FARMERS AND- I WOULD JUST PRIVATELY EXPRESSING MY FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS BILL BUT THAT'S HOW IT GOES I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TO DO THE CLEAN- WE NOT GET THIS THROUGH. QUICKER I MEAN HOW FAST DO WE NEED THIS THE SOLUTIONS IN THE FIELD IN YOUR GUYS VIEW. THINGS LIKE A NO BRAINER BILL SEEMS TO BE SEND COMMITTEE IS IT WORTH TRYING TO GET IT THROUGH AN EMERGENCY LEGISLATION. YEAH MY- WE ARE AT NOT A BY. BAKER BE I MEAN LOOK THE POINT I WANT TO SEE MY CLOTHES NOW RESPONSE POINT SINCE YOU'RE NOT 5% OF CALIFORNIA WATERS WATER WHICH ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED ALREADY POLLUTED SO CLEARLY TONIGHT SHOWING WE'VE GOT SEVEN THOUSAND ENTITIES THE REGISTERS OF THE BILL WHICH YES. MAKE IT IS POSSIBLE PROVOKES. TO COMPLY IT ALSO SEAN WAS SAYING IT HAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY THAT WE'VE SEEN. HEY WE WANT TO HELP THEM TO. THIS IS RESTORING THE BURDEN. MLB ABOUT IDEA TO PUT IN THE URGENCY LEGISLATION. I MOVE THE BILL. THANKS THANK YOU SENATOR A SENATOR ALI. SO- I HAVEN'T GOT THROUGH THE WHOLE BILL BUT I JUST JUST IN GENERAL HOOPS I MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GO TO. GET A BUSINESS LICENSE. WHICH I HAVE IN THE PAST RIGHT YEAR YOU GET YOUR BUSINESS NAME AND GO TO THE COUNTY OR CITY OR WHEREVER YOU'RE AT IN YOUR BUSINESS LICENSE SO. IS IT THAT POINT IS WHERE THEY CAN ASK. WHETHER YOU. HOW TO QUALIFY FOR ASTATE JUST CHARGE FROM IT I MEAN. THERE WAS LEDGES THERE WAS FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THAT STATE LEGISLATION AT ONE POINT THAT WAS IF WATER RAN OFF THE ROOF IN YOUR GUTTER. AND INTO THE STREAM YOU HAVE TO GET A PERMIT. THAT WOULD AND THAT FAILED. IT WAS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT- I WANNA I WANNA KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHO'S GONNA FACT THANK YOU SENATOR- SO WITH THE SYSTEM WE CREATED AND- ALSO RIGHT OFF THE BAT THERE'S A PROVISION IN- THE TWO OH FIVE BILL WE- TO BE CLEAR THAT. NONE OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO SET UP ANY PROCESS OR DO ANY OF THE ANALYSIS THEMSELVES WE ARE NOT. PUSHING THE REGIONAL BOARD OF THE WATER BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY ON TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. SO THE PROCESS CREATED INTO A PRIVATE. THE TWO STEP PROCESS THE FIRST IS THE APPLICANT PROVIDES THEIR S. I. C. CODE NUMBER WHICH EVERY BUSINESS HAS ITS THREE TO FOUR DIGITS- AND THEN FROM THERE. IF THAT AS I SEE CODE NUMBER MATCHES UP WITH WHAT SO THE STATE WATER BOARD COUPLE YEARS AGO PUT TOGETHER A WEB PAGE. ALTHOUGH THE CODES THAT NEED TO BE UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL PERMIT IF THOSE CODES MAY UP. THE LOCAL IT THEY HAVE TO TWO NUMBERS IN THE APPLICATION. AND THEN IF THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS THEY'RE GIVEN THE BUSINESS LICENSE. IF THEY HAVE THE S. I. C. CODE BUT DON'T HAVE A THE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. THERE HAS TO GO TO THE WATER BOARD GET. THAT PROCESS GOING WHICH TAKES ABOUT SEVEN DAYS. WE PUT A PROVISION INTO S. B. TWO OH FIVE THAT IF THERE'S AN EXISTING BUSINESS AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY NEEDED THIS PERMIT COVERAGE. IF THREE MONTHS TO GO SEE THAT- GET THAT NUMBER FROM THE WATER BOARD WHICH AGAIN. THEY SAY TAKES ABOUT SEVEN DAYS TO DO WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY ISSUE WITH. IT HOLDING ANYTHING UP OR DELAYED. AND SO ONCE THEY HAVE THAT THAT SECOND NUMBER THAN THEY CAN RETURN BACK TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND GET THE REST. SO AS SOMEBODY WHO. YOU KNOW ELECTED IN UNDERSTAND THERE'S A- YOU KNOW. A THOUSAND LAWS PASSED IN THIS BUILDING EVERY YEAR AND THE GUY THE PERSON THAT'S OUT THERE THAT DOESN'T THAT'S BEEN CARRYING ON. HE'S GONNA HAVE THREE MONTHS OF THIS BILL PASSES FOR HERE SHE'S GONNA HAVE THREE MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT FIRST OF ALL. DON'T KNOW PART NOT COMPLIANCE. SO IN IS ARE GONNA BE A FINE OR AND WHAT'S THE COST GOING TO BE FOR THE PERSON THAT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DOESN'T FALL LEGISLATION OF DAYS JUST TRYING TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS AND WHOSE IN FORCE WHO'S GOING TO. ENFORCE SO THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT THREE MONTHS TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION TO THE WATER BOARD. AND THEN THEY GET THE FOUR DIGIT CODE. AND THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS UP FOR THOSE THREE MONTHS- AND ONCE THEY HAVE THE NUMBER THEN THAT THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THEM THEIR RENEWAL BUSINESS LICENSE. OR THEIR NEW BUSINESS LICENSE- SO I HOPE I HOPE I MEAN. BASICALLY WHEN YOU FILL OUT THE IN OTHER WORDS YOU GET YOUR NUMBER YOUR FOUR DIGIT CODE RIGHT AND SO NOW THE NEXT YEAR LET'S ASSUME YOUR BUSINESS YOU'VE GOT TO GO AND RENEW YOUR QUESTION SLICES LIKE EVERYBODY DOES IS GONNA BE OF. THIS CAN BE A FOREMAN THERE YOU GO BY YES TELL WHAT YOUR COACH CODE IN BINGO THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S JUST YOU'LL SEE IT ON THE FORM WHEN YOU GET YOUR BUSINESS LICENSE THAT'S WE TRY TO MAKE IT SIMPLE. ARMISEN GONNA. SOLVE THE DILEMMA. DAY INTO A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE- OF WHAT I'M CONFIRM CONCERNED ABOUT IS. THAT IF THE PERSON THAT DOESN'T KNOW. THE DOESN'T KNOW IT. DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS BUILDING EVERY DAY. AND I WANT TO SEE WHO FALLS INTO WHAT CATEGORY BEFORE I. JUST BLANK AT LEAST SAY YES BECAUSE- WE PASSED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS LAWS. OVER TIME AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW UNTIL SOMEONE. COUNTY ITEMS OUT THERE AND SAYS OH YOU. YOU GOT SIX VIOLATIONS IN THERE'S A FINE THERE'S- LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING SOMETHING. I DON'T FALL UNDER THAT LAW. HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. RIGHT. ALL RIGHT SENATOR DICK OKAY HE'S HE'S LIVING ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS. A CENTERS FOR EXPEDITING THE BILL. INTENTLY YEP THE KEY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES YEAH. THE MEASURE ON THE ON THE THERE'S SO TO RESPOND TO THAT SENATOR THERE ISN'T A CONSEQUENCE FOR NOT KNOWING THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS BILL IS ALMOST EDUCATION TO LET THEM KNOW HEY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ENROLLED UNDER THIS PERMIT. GO APPLY FOR THE PERMIT BEFORE WE RENEW YOUR BUSINESS LICENSE THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE INTENT OF THAT THERE THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT FOR NOT KNOWING OR NOT BEING ENROLLED- TO BE HONEST IF IT WITHOUT THIS BILL SOMEONE LIKE ME QUITE FRANKLY OR THE REGIONAL BOARD AN NGO IF WE FOUND OUT THAT SOMEONE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER THE PERMANENT NOT. THERE COULD BE AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION CHALLENGE- IN THAT CASE BUT IT IN THIS BILL THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT I THINK IT GETS TO PROP THEM HEY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER THIS PERMIT AND THEN THEY WOULD GO GET THE APPLICATION NUMBER. YEAH I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST PAGE OF THE MEASURE ON PAGE TWELVE TALKS ABOUT JUNE FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE STATE PORCHER REQUIRE ALL RECIPIENTS OF NOT OF A NON. APPLICABILITY OF IDENTIFICATION NUMBER TO. GET THE INFORMATION BUT THERE IS I SEE NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT REQUIRES THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE FOR THAT. I PROBABLY IS YOUR CALL YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK TO THE LAWS AYE SOME CATCH ALL. VIOLATION OF THE STAFF KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT TO. BUT I ABSENCE IF YOU POINT I DON'T DISAGREE OF HIS HARD TO FOLLOW ALL THE STUFF THAT COMES OUT OF THIS PLACE YOU'RE NOT WRONG. A BUT I THINK. THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE NOT IMPOSING SOME BIG NEW THING ON ANYBODY ELSE ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY'VE GOT THESE PRECIOUS STUFF FOR THIS LOSS IN A PLACE FOR A LONG TIME. WE'RE TRYING TO JUST PUT A MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THESE FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE PER. THAT DON'T KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE PERMITS ACTUALLY HE- FIRED MEETING PLACE IN THEIR BUSINESS CERTIFICATE IN A BUSINESS LICENSE TO COMPLY MAKE IT SUPER SIMPLE FOR THEM TO DO SO. RIGHT THERE'S A WEBSITE THAT THE NUMBERS ARE POSTED. YOU GO LOOK AT IT. IS COULD BE A BLANK FORM IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE REQUIREMENT. FOR THIS DISCHARGE FROM THE STATE TO THE LOCALS AND MAKING SURE BUSINESSES COMPLY. THAT MINUTE THE IMPACT. GOVERNMENT SICK. HOWEVER THIS CHART THE STORM WATER RUNOFF AND STUFF. A. N. AND- HOLD PEOPLE RESPONSE FOR ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING THE CHALLENGE LIKE TO ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS THAT ARE UPSTREAM FROM MY FARM. THEY DON'T GET PERMITS FOR ANYTHING. BUT I DON'T OF THE NECESSARY APPLIES WELL THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO COVER YOUR BILL THE CLAMP DOWN ON THE MAGISTRATE OUT THERE NOT GO SOURCES GLORIA. BUT I JUST CO AUTHORED I SEND YOU THE PICTURE OF IT YOU SEE IT AS A TO THE- I DON'T KNOW TECH STUFF YOU SENT ME RT. WE SHOULD. ALL RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT US FOR NOT VOTE THANK YOU- THE- ASSEMBLY HOLLOW NINE ONE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN HI ALAN I BATES. IT'S NOT VOTING TALLY. DALLY NOT VOTING GONZALEZ SKINNER STERN ALL RIGHT STERN AYE WIECKOWSKI AYE CASKEY AYE. ALL RIGHT THAT'S THREE VOTES THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S LEAVE THE ROLL UP AND YOU MAY PROCEED WITH THEIR NEXT BILL CENTER THAT'S IT. SB NINETY NINE. SO WE CREATED THE IT WAS- AUTUMN BURKE AND- KIM WHO THE OTHER CO AUTHOR WAS CREATED A PROGRAM FOR THESE. TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES WHO IS IT. ARAMBULA STRAIGHT ASSEMBLY MERIMBULA. GAME AND WE CREATED THIS TCC THE CRATES HE GOES COUNCIL WHICH CENTER THERE WAS A MEMBER. WHEN HE WAS IN HIS OLD JOB. AND IT'S NUMBER EIGHTEEN VARIOUS PROGRAMS EIGHT OF IT'S A SERIES OF PROGRAMS. WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PHD IN FILLING OUT FORMS IN DEALING WITH THE STUFF IT'S USUALLY COMPLICATED WE SPENT OVER A YEAR AND AT POINT BUFFER PROCLAIM A BEAUTIFUL TRYING TO GET THEM THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. GENERAL CAST YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY WENT TO. POLAND WITH THE HEAD OF THE VIEW CO COUNSEL I WAS LOBBYING HIM FOR QUITE AWHILE HOLDEN TO LOBBY OF. FOR THIS BUT IT WAS VERY COMPLICATED AND VERY DIFFICULT. THE PROGRAM IS A GREAT PROGRAM IT'S IMPORTANT AND ALL THE OLD YOU KNOW AND CENTER ACCOUNTS YOU WILL REMIND US OF THIS BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT START GREAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BASICALLY LOCKED IN ESSENCE IS DOING T. C. C. LIGHT FOR SMALLER COMMUNITIES SMALLER COMMUNITY PROJECTS THAT AREN'T SO DIFFICULT THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMMUNITIES TO GET INVOLVED. BACKYARDS TO BE IMPACT ESPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES COMMITTEES ARE CHALLENGED TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE THESE PARTNERS IN ALL OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF WHAT IT TOOK FOR US WHICH ULTIMATELY WAS TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR KOYNA. AND JUST AN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT PROCESS AND MAYBE THAT'S GOOD FOR THE BIGGER STUFF AND AN ADMITTEDLY IS SORT OF A CASKET WILL TELL US. THAT IF THIS DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO WHAT AN AEROBIC DIGESTER DOES IN TERMS OF IMPACT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EXTREME HEAT ALL OF THESE THINGS TO GIVE LOCAL. TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCESS FUNDS AND- AND ACTIVISTS THIS PROCESS IN A IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY IT IS IT IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO I HAVE. OF MY RESEARCH A CHRISTIANSEN FROM THE FRIENDS OF THE L. A. RIVER AND READ ADDIS NATURE FOR ALL YOUR TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF. THIS MEASURE. OKAY THE GERMAN YES LET'S GO AHEAD WITH THE- MERCED FIRST YOU WANNA. BUT- SHE'S. WHICH ARE READING BECAUSE HE'S IN WHO GOES OKAY OKAY WE'LL GO IMMERSE ACROSS. ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON. MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG MY NAME IS BRENT CHRISTIANSEN AND THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF. LOS ANGELES BAKER. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE FOR COMMUNITY STUDENTS AND FUTURE LEADERS TO ADVOCATE FOR NATURE CLIMATE AN ATHLETE ON THE L. A. RIVER. OR IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE CELL BECAUSE THE RIVER WE WORK ON FLOWS THROUGH SOME OF THE REGION'S MOST DENSELY POPULATED AND POLLUTION BURDENS. COMMUNITY THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT THE FRONTLINE. MANAGING CLIMATE IMPACT. SB NINETY. WITH SUPPORT PERSPEX COMMITTEE. CRUCIAL BECAUSE AS WE'VE ALL SEEN FROM NUMEROUS DIRE SCIENTIFIC REPORT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY HÌNH LAST MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. EVEN IF THE ENTIRE WORLD ALL SEATS HE EMISSIONS ZERO TOMORROW THE PLAN IT WOULD STILL BE EXPECTED TO WARM. FOR OVER A DECADE. DUE TO THE GASES THAT ARE ALREADY IN OUR ATMOSPHERE. THOUGH BELIEVE IRAQ REALITY IS CALIFORNIA HAVE TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE THAT IS LESS PROFITABLE WHILE DOING ITS PART BECAUSE INITIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO IT. SB NINE NINE EIGHT NINE WILL HELP PREPARE THE STATE SENATE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTIES FOR TAXIS SURE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED OUR REGION AND ACROSS THE STATE. THAT WOULD PROVIDE I'M A FAN OF THAT AS WELL AS OTHER MULTIPLE BENEFITS. THAT WE NEED THE STATE AND STATE AGENCIES LIKE TO CURRENCIES HELD BACK. FOR THAT REASON WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST I THOUGHT ON SP. NINE EIGHT NINE EIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL GO TO YOU MISTER AT. I THANK YOU MEMBERS RE OUT OF SOME. OF NEW FOR WE'RE A LOSS BASED ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON PROTECTING AND RESTORING. THE PUBLIC SPACES OPEN SPACES AND PARK LANDS AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE COMMUNITIES CONNECTED TO THOSE PROJECTS. OBVIOUSLY JUST AS YOU'RE GRAPPLING WITH IT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THEN WANTING TO LOOK AT OUR CONSERVATION PROJECTS THROUGH THAT FILTER WANTING TO. DEVELOP MULTI BENEFIT CLIMATE FOCUSED PROJECTS THEY ARE BOTH DEALING WITH NATURE OPEN SPACE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE THINK THIS MEASURE GOES A LONG WAY PROVIDING US AN ABILITY TO GO PROVIDE THE- ACCESS DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDS. WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WITH LOCAL STATE AGENCIES LIKE CONSERVANCY'S DEVELOP THIS PROJECT. BACON IS MULTI BENEFIT AS POSSIBLE. BUT TO THE SENATORS PORT- POINT% ALLOWING US TO ACTUALLY DO THAT IN A WAY THAT WITH OUR LIMITED CAPACITY. AND WITH OUR LIMITED GROUPS THAT WE WORK WITH WE CAN DO THAT AT A SMALLER SCALE WITH THOSE PROJECTS TOGETHER AND APPLY FOR A GRANT. WITH WITHOUT YOU KNOW YEARS OF WORK AND- EXPERTISE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE'RE WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE WE APPRECIATE THE WAY THAT THE BILL BREAKS OUT IT AND TO BE SICKLY THREE DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS ONE BASED ON COMMUNITY RESILIENCY WANNA LANDSCAPERS ON CM ONE FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WHICH WE OFTEN ALSO THINK IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO US SO FOR THOSE REASONS INSTRUCTOR FOR TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO- ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. HELLO ABIGAIL MILE AND A HALF. THIS IS THE ASIAN OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS LA NEIGHBORHOOD LAND TRUST. CALIFORNIA HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN COALITION. AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ACTION FUND- IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES IN ONCE A VOICE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL SB NINE EIGHTY NINE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB NINE EIGHTY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN IT IS ONE AND THEN VIDEO IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF SB. NINE EIGHTY NINE. WE DO HAVE ONE ONE MOMENT FUTURE AND WE WILL GO TO LINE FOR SEVENTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN THAT BECAUSE FOR SOME BEHALF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF CENTER HERTZBERG SB NINE EIGHT NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AGAIN WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF S. B. NINE EIGHT NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORTING QUEUE AT THIS TIME THE- ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL FOR YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- ARMS I'M HERE I'M SO SORRY I'M SO SORRY THERE IS NO RESERVATION BUT I BUT CERTAINLY WE WOULD WELCOME ANYONE WHO WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL- EITHER ANYONE IN PERSON ON THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR. I DO APOLOGIZE POSITION OF S. B. NINE EIGHT NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE OF MEANT THEY OFFER ANY OPPOSITION. MISTER CAREY AT NOT FINISHING CAN- GREAT OKAY WILL REMIX COMMITTEE I MEAN MY MAIN CONCERN THE BILL IS THIS. REALLY LONG TITLE. THE C. C. P. R. J. C. P. THE COULD COOK COOKER RECOVER FROM. I HAVE SO ARE YOU YOU TO STICK WITH THIS TITLE FOR THE PROGRAM THAT CLIMATE CHANGE REPAIRS RESILIENCY JOBS COMMITTEES PROGRAM. WHERE ARE ALSO BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE YOU ARE H. BORDER I DON'T CARE RIGHT NOW ANYWAY. IT'S VERY DESTRUCTIVE THE DISTANCE DESCRIPTIVE OKAY ANYWAY QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS YES- CINEMA COUNTY. PHOMICINDA STERN BUDGET PUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE TCC PROGRAM OVER THREE YEARS CORRECT- SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE HIS IF IT BECAUSE HI I WILL I LIKE THE IDEA THAT A SMALL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND YOU HAVE A FRIEND IN CENTER COVER HERO WITH HER BILL ELEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH IS ON OUR CONSENT CALENDAR. WHICH FOR A LOT. THE GATORS TO THE NAVIGATORS- A PROGRAM TO HELP HAVE THE OPR HELP THESE ARE OF SMALLER CITIES TO SMALLER CONSERVANCY IS WITH SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT I'M I. FOR THE YELLOW SHIRTS WALKING AROUND THE- THE- HOT BUILDING TODAY AND I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND AS YOU SO ELOQUENTLY STATED DEGREES OF MAGNITUDE CORRECT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT I PULLED OFF FROM THE AIRPORT AIRPORT PROGRAM IF YOU SEE THAT WE ARE THERE'S IN THE STAND WHEN WE DID. SB THIRTY TWO AND WE SAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY. TWENTY FORTY WE FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY FORTY WE HAVE TO REDUCE. EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS AS IS PAGE SIX OF FOOD EXCELLENT STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. ALL EIGHT OF THE CURRENT TCC PROGRAMS COLLECTIVELY IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WILL REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS. TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED TONS. BY THE GREASE OF COMPARISON WE'VE GOT LAST YEAR WE PUT FORTY THREE MILLION INTO THE PCC PROGRAM AND ART ACT OUR ACTUAL CALCULATION WAS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND FOR THE FOR THE FIRST YEAR. A JURY DAY JESTER WE PUT IN SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DERRIDA GESTURES SO THAT'S ABOUT A THIRD WE GOT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON RENEWAL IN. THEY INDICATE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WAS 78% THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE BY THE SPIRIT DIGESTERS 78% OF THEM ARE DISADVANTAGED AND PEOPLE DON'T WE DON'T WE THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO THEM VERSUS 83% OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE IN THE- TCC PROGRAM SO SEVENTY EIGHT EIGHTY THREE COMPARE IT. COMPARISON BUT IF WE COULD SPEND THE MONEY THE SAME MONEY ON VERY TIGHT GESTURES FORTY THREE MILLION AS WE DID ON PCC'S WE WOULD HAVE FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON REDUCTION. COMPARED TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION WITH THAT SAID I'M JUST I'M DOING THAT FOR COMPARISONS BECAUSE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO GET EIGHTY UP ON REDUCING CARBON- BUT WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM. AND ITS COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS AND SOME SMALLER FOLKS ARE NOT BEING A- COMPLICATED. AS TO THE HAVE NOTS SO. BUT LIKE WE GOTTA GET A LOT OF BANG FOR OUR BUCK BUT SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE PUCK OUT THERE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS OTHER SMALLER ENTITIES TO COMPETE FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO GET PERHAPS MAYBE A LARGER BENEFITS THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING FROM THE EIGHT PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT COIN IS DOING TO BE UNIFIED THEIR THEIR CITY BUT THAT'S THAT'S- I THOUGHT IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CLIMATE LESSONS SO I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY. AND I MOVED THE BILL- IT IS UNDERSTOOD. THAT'S ALL I WAS GONNA DO IS MOVE THE BILL COULD PLEASE LEGISLATION NOT MY OWN MAYBE IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU CAN DRESS BUT- HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET WITH THESE LIKE- BECAUSE-I NOTICED IN THE DEFINITION OF. UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES COULD EVEN BE A LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD. FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITY BUT BILL. I JUST DON'T I I'M TRYING TO THINK. OF THESE LITTLE POCKETS OF AREAS LIKE IN LA WE'VE CANOGA PARK RIGHT. LOST IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. HARD TO ORGANIZE THEIR IT'S TOUGH. AND BUT SO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF OPPORTUNITY BUT- I DON'T LIKE HOW MUCH ORGANIZING AS A COMMUNITY. HAVE TO DO TO QUALIFY FOR ONE OF THESE IT COULD JUST BE A- HOUSEHOLD QUALIFYING INTERIORS. WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR VISION YEAH IN THEORY SENATOR AD YES BUT I THINK IN PRACTICE WILL PROBABLY FIND IS PROJECTS THAT ARE PROBABLY THE ONE TO FIVE MILLION DOLLAR RANGE THAT. WOULD OKAY YOU KNOW AND NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL OF PROBABLY THE SMALLEST UNIT IF THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH. IT DOES OKAY THANKS. GREAT GUY CLOSER QUICKLY. BUT YES BUT I WOULD LIKE I MEAN I REPUBLICAN FRIENDS OF ASKING ABOUT THE MONEY I MEAN I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A BUDGET ASKS US HERE WITH THIS- IF YOU COULD CLARIFY. AND JUST REAL QUICKLY HI I LIKE THE GOAL OF THE BILL BUT- TO HAVE JUST YOU KNOW NO IDEA OF HOW MUCH MONEY AND- TO SENATOR STERN'S QUESTION HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SMALLER COMMUNITIES CAN COMPETE. I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA. OF THAT. GIVE GOOD JOB. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET I ASKED FOR AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR TCC SO IS AS I READ THIS I WITHOUT THAT THAT WOULD BE FORTUNATE THAT. I HAVE FOR. RIGHT WHAT WILL BE. ULTIMATELY CITIES YOU SEE LIGHT. YEAH SO LOOK I THINK THE ANSWER HERE'S THIS. I MEAN I THINK WHAT YOU KNOW AND I'VE BEEN HAMMERING THE SAME POINT THE SENATE WOULD COST YOU DID ALL OF OUR CLIMATE GROUPS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETS GET MONEY TO REDUCE CAUGHT PEOPLE'S BILLS LET'S HAVE MONEY TO DO THESE OTHER THINGS AND IF OUR CLEAR OBJECTIVE IS JUST TO REDUCE GHGS I THINK WE SHOULD SPEND THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND ADJUSTERS AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE A PLACE WHERE WE COULD POSSIBLY PUT IT DIGESTED SHOULDN'T BE THERE. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE GHGS BUT ALSO THE METHANE THE SHORT TERM POLLUTANTS THE IMPACT EIGHT WHAT EIGHTY TIMES WHAT THE IMPACT IS OF CARBON EXTRAORDINARY RIGHT IT IS A IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT OUR OBJECTIVES ARE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WHERE WHERE WE TALKED LAST ON THE FLOOR THAT WAS WILL CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT THE IDEA OF CLIMATE CHANGE VERSUS CLIMATE CHANGED WE NOW FIFTEEN EXTREME HEAT WE'RE NOW FACING IMPACTS ON INDIVIDUALIZED COMMITTEES. THE IDEA IT SEEMS TO ME IN TERMS OF THE DEMOCRACY IS TO GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMUNITIES THAT CAN'T DON'T HAVE THE P. H. D.'S IN AND A BUREAUCRACY TO GET ACCESS TO FUNDS TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT REDUCE EXCHANGES MUCH BUT MAYBE MAKE THINGS MORE COMFORTABLE MAYBE DEAL EXTREMELY MAYBE DO OTHER THINGS. THAT IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE COMMITTEE BEING FORMED A COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT DEALS WITH THIS CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID AB THIRTY TWO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX RIGHT HE WAS WITH DARIA FROM ARE USED TO CALL THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER BILL NO ONE REALLY BELIEVED IT NO ONE KNEW WHICH CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. LOVE ABOUT BLOOD SO WE JUST SAID FINE LET'S JUST GIVE THIS ALL TO AN AGENCY AND SEE WE CAN MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION NOW WE'VE EVOLVED INTO A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSION AROUND CLIMATE THE IMPACT. AND GOING FOR. THE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND SO AS WE ARE TO CREATE THE ARE. FRAMEWORK IF YOU WILL. YOU KNOW YOU COURSE CORRECT ALONG THE WAY. YOU LEARN YOU GROW WE DO TEACH YOU SEE THAT SOME INTERESTING IMPACTS. YOU KNOW AND SO NOW WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS IT'S HARD. FOR SMALLER GROUPS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS GLORIA BOARD THAT HAS TO GO BECAUSE PROCESS THERE'S A CHECK AND BALANCE OF ALL THE SYSTEMS. IS NOT JUST WRITING CHECKS AS THE WHOLE PROCESS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OTHERWISE INSPIRED. THE IMPACT THEIR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS TO ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. AND I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN THAT REGARD NOW STRUGGLE. HI THANKS FOR CALLING I THE NUMBER THREE SB NINE EIGHT NINE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE FIRST RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN ALLEN AYE BATES BATES NOT VOTING TALLY. DALLY NOT VOTING GONZALEZ SKINNER STERN ALL RIGHT STERN I WHITE HOUSE LIKE MAKOWSKI I. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR HERTZBERG. THE SENATE CAREER YOU MAY PURCHASE THE DYESS SB FOURTEEN TEN WE WERE YEARS MUST BEEN BURNING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX WHICH IS CLAMPING DOWN ON. DANGEROUS CRIMINAL- ILLEGAL GROWERS UPSTREAM FROM SENATE DOLLIES FARM AND HE'S VERY INTERESTED IN GIVING HIS THOUGHTS ON THIS IS WE CAN MAKE THAT BUILD STRONGER AND BETTER SO AS TO ADDRESS THAT ENORMOUSLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE WHICH I'VE I'M PROUD OF COSTS OF YOUR BILL SENATE KRIGING OTHERS TO DO THE SAME. YEAH WITH THAT IN MIND LET'S GO ON TO SB FOURTEEN TEN. AND YOU MAY PURSUE IN RIGHT RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FOURTEEN TEN TODAY LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR THEIR WORK ON THAT THIS COMPLEX ISSUE AND A THOROUGH ANALYSIS IN THE BILL IT WAS REALLY WELL DONE. AS YOU KNOW IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB SEVEN FORTY THREE BY SENATOR STEINBERG THAT BILL ESTABLISHED AS A TOOL ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS UNDER SYKORA FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO TO STREAMLINE THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION. OF THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER DOWNTOWN IN ADDITION THE BILL ALSO TASK THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH FOR PR WITH THE TASK TO DEVELOP NEW C. CORE GUIDELINES TO REPLACE AREN'T QUITE YET USED. TO MAKE. IMPAX WHICH MEASURED THE LEVEL OF SO AT INNER. IMPACTED BY THE INFILL DEVELOPMENT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPMENT IMPOSSIBLE TO MITIGATE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU FOUND IN THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER. HAD THEY USED THE- THAT- MEASUREMENT OF LEVEL OF SERVICE AT THAT POINT THERE JUST NO WAY THAT YOU CAN INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THE STREETS. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TRANSPORTATION- THROUGH GIVEN THE SIZE OF THAT OF THE CONSTRUCTION. IN TWENTY TWENTY- PURE DEVISED ANOTHER METHODOLOGY TO SATISFY SECRET FOR INFILL PROJECTS. IN TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS. AND THEY CALL THAT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- OR VMT. BMT IS A MEASURE OF HOW MANY VEHICLE TRIPS ARE GENERATED BY A POP PROJECT. AND MUST NOW BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT'S LOCATED. ROGERS WITH IBM T. THE DEVELOPER MAY BE ASSESSED TO BE EMPTY MITIGATION FEE OR BE REQUIRED TO BUILD AMENITIES OR DESIGN FEATURES. THAT REDUCE BE EMPTY. AND THERE'S A GREAT LAST IN- ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS THAT TALKS ABOUT WHAT THOSE. AMENITIES DESIGN FEATURES OR- MITIGATION MEASURES ARE AND I AND I AND I WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE- MY DISK. HERE TODAY REALLY HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WHAT THAT EXPANSION DID. TWO IN RURAL CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE LIST OF MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU HAVE THEY THEY JUST DON'T WORK IN RURAL CALIFORNIA- BUYER TO SEND MY DISTRICT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CITY OF SALINAS IN THE CITY NOW THATIN THE NEW DISTRICT THE CITY OF FRESNO. THERE THERE IS VERY VERY LIMITED TRANSIT OPPORTUNITIES- THAT YOU CAN USE ON A REGULAR BASIS TO GET TO WORK IN REALLY KEPT RURAL CALIFORNIA YOU ABSOLUTELY DEPEND ON THE VEHICLE. TO BE ABLE TO GET TO WORK MANY PEOPLE TRAVEL. MINIMUM THIRTY MILES TO GET TO A FIELD OR- OR A PROCESSING FACILITY AND IT NOW WITH THE NEW INFLUX OF PEOPLE FROM. THE BIG CITIES THAT MOSTLY SUBCONTRACTOR IN THE BAY AREA THEY TRY. BROKEN IT. AN HOUR AND A HALF SO TO INCORPORATE NEIGHBORHOOD ELECTRIC VEHICLE NETWORK OR- ORIENT PROJECT. TRANSIT BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES METHOD THAT'S A JOKE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE RIDING A BICYCLE OR SENDING YOUR KIDS ACROSS THE STREET WHEN YOU'VE GOT- PRODUCE TRUCKS AND- BIG VEHICLES THAT ARE ARE MOVING EQUIPMENT COMING THROUGH YOUR- YOUR COMMIT COMMUNITY PROVIDE BICYCLE PARKING IMPLEMENTED PROVIDE ACCESS TO COMMUTE REDUCTION PROGRAM. PROVIDE CAR SHARING BIKE SHARING RIGHT PROGRAMS DOES IT JUST DO NOT WORK AND SO THE CHALLENGE BECOMES AT. BAD IN MANY COMMUNITIES- TO USE A V. M. T. THAT WOULD THE THAT THAT THAT METHODOLOGY WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO IMPOSE SOME KIND OF A FEE AND A FEE AS YOU KNOW STARTS TO IMPACT. HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE AND IT PITS ARE ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS AGAINST OUR HOUSING INTERESTS AND BECOMES MORE EXPENSIVE- TO BUILD HOUSING THE HIGHLIGHT HOW EXTREME IMPLEMENTING VM TEAM MAYBE. SAN DIEGO COUNTY RECENTLY PROPOSED A VMT MITIGATION FEE RANGING FROM FIFTY FROM FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TWO MILLION PER NEW HOMES FOR RECENT HOUSING PROJECT. AND WHILE THIS SPACE SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION IT AND HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED IT'S A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BE EMPTY AND THAT'S IN SAN DIEGO WHERE THEY HAVE- INTO IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY A MORE ROBUST- TRANSPORTATION PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT IN MOST OF. OF OF CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR IN MY IN MY REGION. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS NOT ONLY A SUPPLY ISSUE AND IT'S AN AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AS A MEDIUM HOME PRICE IN THE STATE CONTINUES TO RISE MANY FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO BUY OR RENT IN THE SUBURBS OR IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. TO FIND HOUSING THAT THEIR BY. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING MY DISTRICT AND PEOPLE COMING. INTO MY NIELSEN PATTERSON IN NEWMAN FROM THE BAY AREA THEY'RE SUPER COMMUTERS. THE DRUG OVER AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HALF TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY A HOME. IN CALIFORNIA MANY READ HAVE NO BUT TO COMMUTE LONG. DUE TO THE LACK OR OR OF OR RELY AND RELIABILITY OF PUBLIC TRANSIT IN ORDER TO COMMUTE TO THEIR JOBS OR TO RUN ERRANDS ERRANDS. BMT WILL DISCOURAGE THE MUCH NEEDED HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN OUR STATE'S RURAL COUNTIES AND CITIES WHICH IS WHY I'VE AUTHORED THIS BILL TO LIMIT ITS APPLICATION TO TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SB SEVEN FORTY SIX. AND RETURNED TO LEVELS OF SERVICE OR ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO MITIGATE AIR POLLUTION FOR THOSE AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS AND FRANKLY- I'M- MIKE MY AT ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS ON THIS BILL SENATOR ROTH ONE OF THE REASON HE IS SO SOLIDLY IN FAVOR OF COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION. IS WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN IN RIVERSIDE IS. OF PEOPLE. IN THE LA AREA WHO CAN WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY THEIR OWN HOME AND THEN GET OUT- IN IN RIVERSIDE AND THE CONGESTION AND THE- THAT DRIVING IS SO. DIFFICULT THAT THEY- THEY THEN START TO ORGANIZE AROUND. AT THAT IT IMPACTING THE FREEWAY SYSTEMS ARE EXPANDING THE FREEWAY SYSTEMS- IN AND WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS THAT WERE IMPOSING THIS SYSTEM ON TOP OF IN AN EQUAL DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE AND SO WE WE'VE DONE IT IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY THAT PENALIZING THE COMMUNITIES ARE BUILDING THE HOUSING AND THAT PENALIZING THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE POOR- BECAUSE- PEOPLE MOVE THERE BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO MOVE THERE- AND IT STARTS PUSHING OUT RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY. IN THE GUEST BOOK THAT ARE MOVING IN ARE EARNING TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ORIGINALLY LIVED THERE AND SO IT STARTS CREATING THESE INEQUALITIES AND- THE CHALLENGES SAID THEN PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BUILD ANYMORE HOUSING BECAUSE IT BECOMES IT STARTS IMPACTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR AND THEIR COMMUTE SO. DO WE HAVE HERE. WE FLARED OVER A SYSTEM IN- IN OUR ATTEMPT TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES BUT WILL THE COMMUNITIES IT REALLY SHOULD BE PROVIDING A LOT MORE HOUSING- AREN'T DOING IT AND PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES SO NOT ONLY YOU THINK IT'S GONNA COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY A LOT MORE MONEY FOR THE HOUSING AND- AND OF COURSE AS I SAID IT DRIVES UP THE- THE COST OF HOUSING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THAT. LOCAL PEOPLE CAN AFFORD IT EITHER SO- I THINK THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS THAT- WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS TO BRING SOME LOGIC AND SOME- CONSISTENCY IN THE STATE AROUND HOW WE'RE GOING TO- PLAN TO MITIGATE AIR QUALITY ISSUES AROUND TRANSPORTATION AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T END UP NEGATIVELY IMPACT US AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH THE CHAIR- ABOUT THIS- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT MISTER CHAIR AND- ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT DUE TO- I SUBMISSION ERROR. THAT THE- THE ANALYSIS DOESN'T ACCURATELY REFLECT THE FULLEST OF SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. AND I WANNA- HIGHLIGHT THAT THE BILL HAS SUPPORT FROM GROUPS LIKE TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA UNITED CONTRACTORS CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL OF LABOUR'S BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION OPERATING ENGINEERS JUST TO NAME A FEW- IT RIVER SOME ERROR IN TERMS OF SUBMITTING SUBMITTING THAT INFORMATION SO- AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CHAIR I'M IN IT EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AT THIS TIME THERE OUTLINED ON. PAGES ELEVEN AND TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS IN WITH THE CAVIAR- I DON'T LIKE STUDIES IT'S USUALLY A WAITED TO SHELVE SOMETHING AND NOT GET ANYTHING DONE BUT I THINK THIS THERE'S A REAL INTERSECTION HERE BETWEEN HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT AND SO- IT MAY BE THAT THAT THERE'S A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN COME TO IF WE GET ALL THE GROUPS TOGETHER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WE KNOW SOMETHING SHORT OF A STUDY BUT IT MAY BE THAT THE STUDIES THE ONLY WAY TO GET THAT INFORMATION I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEND THIS BACK TO THE SAME ENTITY THAT PREPARED. THE IBM T. IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A DIFFERENT RESULT AND I DON'T THINK THAT. THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH OF AN ANALYSIS OF OUR PRIORITY ON BUILDING HOUSING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BUILD TWO POINT FIVE MILLION OR THREE MILLION HOUSING UNITS- WE DESPERATELY NEEDED IN THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T GOING TO GET US THERE SO- I PUT I PUT. THE CHAIRS UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUE- AND- I'M THANKFUL FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THE ISSUE FURTHER TO CLARIFY WHAT ACTIONS WE SHOULD TAKE. WE NEED. ALSO SALUTE. WILL ACHIEVE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. AND NOT STYMIE THE NECESSARY HOUSING PRODUCTION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THAT IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED IN RURAL CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THAT MY- MY A GOOD FRIEND- FROM- SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE SUGGESTED AS WE STOP GIVING TAX CREDITS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT BUILDING THE HOUSING BETTER ADDRESSING THE JOBS- OR WE TAKE ALL THAT TRANSIT DOLLARS AND WE PUT HIM TO EXPAND TRANSIT TO. RURAL AND SUBURBAN COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN. HAVE PARITY IN TERMS OF THE TRANSIT OPPORTUNITIES. THOSE ARE ALL POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE WAY BEYOND KIND OF WHERE WHERE WE'RE AT BUT IT IT JUST IT STARTS TO. EXPLAIN WHY THIS ISSUE IS SO DESPERATELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED THAT WE NEED TO AMELIORATE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE- WE'VE- PRODUCED IN THE PAST AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO. CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES TO BUILD HOUSING TO GROW AND IT. OF THE NEEDS OF THEIR CA. THIS WELL SO. I THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND FOR YOUR IN YOUR- WORK ON IT. MISTER CHAIR AND WITH THAT I WILL- WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES. FLASK WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS STEVE CRUZ WHO'S HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WILL TESTIFY IN PERSON IN MY QUICKLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR JOB AND HE'LL TESTIFY REMOTELY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBER STEVE CRUZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- THEIR CAREER THEY'RE WONDERFUL JOB- IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM WITH THE EXISTING V. M. T. REGULATIONS AND- I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- HOW SERIOUS- THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BECOME IN TERMS OF AS YOU SEE IN THESE. REGULATIONS PUT IN PLACE. THEY ARE CREATING- SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS- TO BUILDING. ENTRY LEVEL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- MULTI HOUSING A MULTI UNIT PROJECTS- AND I'D HAVE PASSED OUT A GRAPHIC IF YOUR- IF THE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE IT IF NOT I'LL JUST REFERENCE IT IS. THE PHENOMENA AS YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE IT IS THE DRIVE UNTIL YOU CAN AFFORD INITIATIVE A GRAB BAG OF SORRY YOU CAN GET IT BUT- JUST A GRAPHICS IT DEMONSTRATING THAT THE FURTHER YOU MOVE OUT FROM THE JOB CENTERS HOUSE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE YOU'RE PAYING. FOR HOUSING COSTS- AND JUST DECIDE SOME OF THE NUMBERS YOU MIGHT GET TO A DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT IF YOU'RE BUILDING SOMEWHERE FURTHER OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. OPERATE THE CENTER. AND YOU MIGHT BE A HUNDRED. A SQUARE FOOT SO. A HER THOUSAND DOLLARS PER THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME AN INFILL PROJECT- CITY. IS NOT AFFORDABLE AND SO WE WERE LOW TAKING- HOUSING. OFF AND SHELVING PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMPLY. AGAIN CENTER COMMUNITY GREAT JOB OF DESCRIBING THE- HOW THE VMT METRIC WORKS AND HOW IT'S APPLIED- I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT- ON THE ON THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THAT. WE I THINK SEPTEMBER TWELFTH THAT LOCKS NIGHT OF SESSION- IT WAS ABOUT THE GOLDWASSER BILL THAT THAT LANGUAGE WAS IN THERE TO GIVE A PRICE AT THE READY. AND IT WAS IN OUR PERSPECTIVE ALWAYS MEANT FOR TRANSPORTATION PRIORITY AREAS AND SO THIS BILL IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH THAT- AND WHILE THERE WAS A PROCESS THROUGH. TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS WE PARTICIPATED HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN THAT PROCESS. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT WASN'T A CONSENSUS PRODUCT WRITERS LIKE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE THEY ARE THAN OURS ARE DOING WITH THOSE CONSEQUENCES. I ALSO WHAT IT DECIDED. WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS BILL WORK WITH THE CENTER THAT IT'S BRINGING TOGETHER PRETTY DIVERSE COALITION OF SUPPORT YOU KNOW WITH- WITH BUILDERS WITH WITH LABOR- WITH THE WITH THE MPO ISN'T THERE'S A NUMBER OF NPOS ACROSS THE STATE ARE HAVING. TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES WITH THIS AND SOME AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OWN DISTRICT- THAT THEY'RE CREATING THESE INEQUITIES AND HOUSING COST AND SOCIAL INEQUITIES- WE JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT IN THE ANALYSIS- BEFORE I. FINISH UP HERE IS THAT- THERE IS A REFERENCE TO THE COURT CASE- THE TWO HUNDRED VERSUS OF THE ARTIFACT. TECH CASES NOT BEEN DISMISSED BUT THEY WERE ASKED TO- MAKE IT AMENDMENTS SO IT'S STILL PENDING AND I THINK THERE'S A HEARING ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH- IN THE LAST THREE AS YOU SAID- WE CAME WITH THE BILL TODAY- WE THINK THAT'S- A SOLUTIONS THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS A CENTER ALLEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I KNOW WE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK AS WELL- TO GIVE THIS MORE CONSIDERATION. I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR FROM OTHER WITNESSES THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS REALLY NEEDS TO LOOK AT- THERE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU. THANK YOU THINK STEVE. AYE MR QUICKLY WE SAYS YOU TO. TRY TO GIVE A BRIEF- STEVE DID A GREAT JOB AT THE TAKE UP SOME TIME SO- IF WE- WILL TURN UNANIMOUS A QUICKLY. THANK YOU I WILL BE A- BIT WITH BRIEF HERE.

THREE YOU KNOW WE ARE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF SEVEN FORTY THREE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ITS DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTATION WE BELIEVE THAT SEVEN FORTY THREE MAKE.

FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BILL FORWARD I REPRESENT A DISTRICT SIMILAR TO YOURS. AND I JUST WANT TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF YOU KNOW. THE OPPOSITION I'M I'M A FORMER. WE DON'T FUND WILLIAMSON ACT IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A PRESERVATION TO HELP OPEN SPACING KEEP FERTILE GROUNDS RIGHT HERE YOU DRIVE OUT I FIVE AND I HAVE TO GO HOME THAT WAY AND WE'RE PAVING OVER AND BUILDING HOMES ON. THIS FARM GROUND WORLD. THAT'S NUMBER ONE CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS A VERY LARGE STATE AND IS VERY HAS DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY HAS DIFFERENT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL THIS IS THE COMES OUT HERE DOESN'T WORK. IN ALL PLACES AND FOR ALL THOSE INFILL BILLS I AGREE WE NEED INFILL AYE I. HAVE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT. GOING BY THE HOSTESS FACTORY RIGHT HERE ON FIFTY. THERE'S A PERFECT PLACE TO PUT IN HOMES. YOU HAVE LIGHT RAIL YOU HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND YOU HAVE A- HAVE A BROWNFIELD ALL IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE WE SHOULD AND WE HAVE JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THIS TOWN. I MEAN HOUSING. IT OFFERS IN MY- I WILL THAT. THERE'S ALL RESIDENTIAL. THAT DOESN'T MEET ALL THESE CRITERIA THAT WE'VE PUT ON IT STARTED BACK WITH SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT BUILDING THESE AND LET I CAME AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE. I DID SUBDIVISIONS. AND THE WARS OF THOSE I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO SEE. AT THE AT THIS LEVEL OF MY JOB. BUT THE PERFECT PLANNERS OF THE WORLD WILL TELL YOU. THAT WE NEED TO PUT ALL THESE PEOPLE IN IN A- CONDENSED AREAS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT THE PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT THAT ONE A LITTLE PIECE OF AMERICAN WANT PEACE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE LITTLE TO SPACE IT'S REALLY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE'RE WE'RE SHOVING THOSE BOXES SO. AND WE'VE AND WE'RE DOING THAT WE HAVE CREATED THAT GET WHAT THEY WANT AND A VERY BUNCH OF A BUNCH OF POOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T GET. WHAT THEY WANT THEY THEY'RE THE ONES THAT GET STUCK. SITUATIONS WHERE THEY- LONG WAY IS A KEY. FOR TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY WORK IN. AND GIVE THE SERVICE IT'S ALL THOSE RICH PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT REALLY IS PLACE AND I'VE BEEN TRAVELING THE STATE RECENTLY AND I SEE IT EVERYWHERE THE PEOPLE THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICE INDUSTRY TO THE WEALTHY. DON'T LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND I HAVE. THE PLACE LAKE TAHOE VERY POPULAR JERRY BUT THE BILLIONAIRES ARE KICKING OUT THE MILLIONAIRES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WANNA. THIS IS TRUE THIS IS THE FACT. AND YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE AREAS LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE YOUR FOOD AND CLEAN HOTEL ROOMS IN THE SUCH WHEN YOU VISIT MY DISTRICT DON'T LIVE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE MUSIC IN RENO NEVADA. AND THEY TRAVEL TO TAHOE TO SERVE. THE WEALTHY PEOPLE FOR SAM'S IS GOING TO HAVE THEIR SECOND THIRD HOMES THERE. THAT'S A FACT. SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT YOUR BILL I. I AM AMID THE STEPS YOU'RE ABLE TO DO AS A LEGISLATOR IT IS AWESOME THAT YOU'RE TO BRING. TO THE TABLE AB SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT I'M ONE OF SUPPORT YOUR BILL OBVIOUS TODAY. BUT KEEP IN MIND ALL OF THE- WE'RE DRIVING HARDWORKING PEOPLE OUT A COMPANY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR HOMES LIKE INSANE SO I THINK WE NEED TO COMPROMISE I THINK WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT CALIFORNIA ARE ONE SIZE FITS ALL WE SHOULD BE DOING INFILL WHERE SPORT MAKES SENSE BUT WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM SO GREAT FOR THE IT IS THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SENATOR ALSO ABLE TO HELP I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT. FINDING THINGS LIKE THE WHIMS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AFTER THE DEBATE YEAH THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ARE SENATOR CAFIERO AND I AM GOING TO SUPPORT IT BUT I JUST MAY HAVE TO MAKE ONE OF THE TORIO COMMENTS SO YOU READ THE ANALYSIS AND- THERE'S A- OVER. THEIR VM. INCREASES ARE. WHEN THE CBI. THAT BILLS AND FINANCES. THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TELL. THAT THAT PARTICULAR REQUIREMENT FOR YEP. E. R. B. M. T. OF MITIGATION RAISES THE COST OF A HOUSE WE NEED TO LISTEN THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE FINANCING IT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE BUILDING AT ONE THIRTY IN THE PEOPLE FOR. TRACTORS IT ALL IN A CAR ARE SO I IT WOULD BE I THINK I WOULD PERSONALLY APPRECIATE WE HAVE THESE DEBATES THAT A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF TWO DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THINGS LIKE THIS- ADEQUATELY. PRESENTED IN OUR ANALYSES HAPPENED TO ME THIS MORNING ON ANOTHER BILL YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA DEBATE INFORMATION THAT DON'T WANT. I DON'T LIKE TO EQUAL OF WAIT WHEN I READ THAT BUT WHEN I READ SOME OF THESE IN OUR THESE ARE COMING OF CA. M. PRICE BECAUSE- TACTIC BEEN INVOLVED IN BUSINESS FOR THIRTY FORTY YEARS AND NO BOTTOM LINE WHAT RAISES THE COST OF HOUSING NOT JUST IN THE STATE BUT IN THE NATION IN FRONT NEEDS TO A- TO THE- THERE THEN. ALL WE- TO BUY A PARTICULAR POSITION WE HAVE I SUPPORT YOUR THANK. ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. AND I THINK SENATE DOLLY. DID HI I'M. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT THE TURKEY MEAT- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY- THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE COST OF HOUSING RIGHT IT'S ALSO ABOUT. SPRAWL IN THE COSTUME ARCHER AND SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT VERY PHENOMENON THAT- THAT SENATE ALI WAS MENTIONING- INVOLVING. HAVING TO DRIVE IN FROM LONG DISTANCES TO COME WORK IS. REYES IS ACTUALLY PARTLY WHAT THIS THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL SCHEME OF THREE SEVENTY FIVE SEVEN FOUR THREE ARE TRYING TO AVOID RIGHT WE DO WE DO WE REALLY WELL KNOWN COURAGE FOR MORE THE SUPER MEETING THAT YOU. THAT APPLE BY THAT STATE GOT OF OUR FREEWAYS AND- IT POLLUTE OUR AIR AND CRISP THAT PORCELAIN PEOPLE SPEND SO MUCH TIME BEHIND THE ROLE IN THE CITY WITH THEIR FAMILIES. SO ANYWAY. THEY'RE GONNA BE GREAT DISCUSSION I LOOK FOR TO AYE AYE I THINK YOU FOR DISCUSSIONS MORNING AYE AYES I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THE MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION. AND A HALF. WITH A PARTITION THE AMOUNT COMMUNITY IN YOUR SPONSORS. WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES- AND I THINK YOU FOR YOU CERTAINLY PRODUCT IMPORT ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO. TAKE IN WELL THE AND GRAPPLE WITH. ARE WHILE ALSO STILL. MAINTAINING THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF. THAT I THINK THAT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT WITH IT WITH SB SEVEN FORTY THREE- AND SO WITHOUT A CLEANING. YES. OKAY WE'LL CENTER BATES IS MOVING BILL. AND- AND WILL WILL- BECAUSE WHAT WILL LET YOU CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO TESTIFIED IN AND HAS A- AN OPINION ON IT- I'M ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED INFILL IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M STILL WORKING SO HARD ON SB SIX IT'S OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY. I'M WAITING TO BE HEARD INCOME WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO CREATE PRETTY CLOSE TO TWO TO THREE MILLION HOUSING UNITS USE IT AND- I KNEW THAT OR UNDER UTILIZED COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL- PROPERTY THAT'S LOCATED IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT THIS REALLY- THIS REALLY AFFECTS THE WAY BEYOND THAT- AND ANNA IT OCCURRED TO ME AS I'M I'M LISTENING TO PEOPLE SPEAK THAT. YOU KNOW PART OF THE CHALLENGES IS YOU MAY NEVER VISIT ANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR HOUSING. ARE VERY POOR LOCATED RURAL CALIFORNIA WHERE. THERE ARE VERY LITTLE IT BY THE IN THE WAY OF SERVICES BOTH BOTH IN TERMS OF- GROCERY STORES AND PHARMACIES IN THE KINDS OF AMENITY. ONE EIGHT COMMUNITY THEY- THEN YOU. BUT EVERYTHING THERE SO THAT YOU FIND- AND SO MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ORGANIZE A TRIP COMMANDO TO AND A FIRE BINDER HERE ON INTO- CHOWCHILLA SO PEOPLE COULD SEE- THAT THE- AND TALK TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE. SENATOR YOUR CALL IT'S ABOUT- LISTENING TO A BROAD GROUP- ARRAY OF PEOPLE THAT THE FIRST. JEWELS THAT BROUGHT THE IS. IT'S BECAUSE HE SAID WE WANT TO BUILD WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR- OUR METHODOLOGY AND THIS IS REALLY HARD ON OUR COMMUNITY SINCE I STARTED ASKING WHAT IS THE COST SAN DIEGO CAME OUT WITH THAT THE COST FIRST AND YOUR FIRST KNOWS WORKING ON THEIRS RIGHT NOW WE SPEAK AND THERE'S A COST TO CHANGING THE METHODOLOGY- BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS IT IT IT'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG A BIG IMPACT ON THE SMALLER COMMUNITY THAT BETTER LOOKING FOR HOUSING AND HAVE THE CAPABILITY. FOR YOU CAN STILL BUY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES- AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AND- WE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL TENT OF THE OF A BILL WHICH WOULD CEASE IT SAID AREAS TRANSIT AUTHORITY AREAS AT. I POINT. THE WENT IT ALL CENTER BECAUSE ABSOLUTE RIGHT JUST DOESN'T IT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR- HIS HIS HIS COMMENTS AND- INTEREST IN WORKING WITH ME GETTING GROUPS TOGETHER TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE THERE IS A NEED FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS AND IF IT IS. IT WAS ONLY IF DOING VMT MEANT THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES WOULDN'T SEND THEIR RESIDENTS. TO OUR TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE CAN BUILD FOR OUR OWN. I'D BE FAT DUMB AND HAPPY I MEAN I JUST BE HAPPY THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN WE BUILD HOUSING- IT ATTRACTS PEOPLE TO COME FROM AREAS THAT WERE THERE NOT BUILDING HOUSING RIGHT AND SO. I YOU KNOW I'M I'M I STRUGGLE BECAUSE- I REALLY DO WANT. THESE COMMUNITIES. TO GROW BECAUSE WHEN AFTER TALKED TO THE RETAILERS THEY SAY WERE WILLING TO GO IN BUT THEY NEED MORE HOUSING YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR US TO BE THERE. AND- AND SO IS THE CHICKEN AND EGG THING HOW DO WE GET THERE HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE REALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES BUT WE DO IT IN A WAY WHERE PEOPLE WERE COMMUNITIES ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING HOUSING FOR THE JOB. CREATING AND THAT THAT GOES BEYOND THIS BILL BUT SOMEHOW WE NEED TO TALK. TO GET THAT I BELIEVE THE TESTIMONY WHEN THEY SAY IT THE BE. THE IMPACT ON GREENHOUSE GASES IS GOING TO BE MINUSCULE. IN COMPARISON TO THE COST- CAN BUILD A HOUSE IN THAT. COST THEN GETS TRANSLATED INTO THE INABILITY OF PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY BE TO LIVE THERE SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS- AND WITH A SOLUTION THAT. THAT HOPEFULLY REALLY MANAGES. WHAT I THINK RIGHT NOW IS A REALLY TOUGH SITUATION. OKAY FOR THE MOTION AS DEEP AS AMENDED YES WITH LOTS MORE WORK TO BE DONE- APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS ON BOTH SIDES LET'S SEE WE CAN SEE WE CAN WAS HE WAS SORT OF PROGRESS WE CAN MAKE HERE- PLEASE. CALL SURE THE ITEM NUMBER SIX SB FOURTEEN TEN BY SENATOR COVER THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN HI ALAN ALL RIGHT BATES BATES ALL RIGHT ALI AND ALI I CAN SALAS SKINNER STERN STERN HIGHWAY CAL SKI MY COUNTY I. OKAY THAT'S FIVE VOTES- ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE US THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE CAREER. J. WILL I SEE SO HERE. COME ON UPSET ALERTS GOING TO PRESENT ITEMS SEVEN- I NOW I KNOW NOTHING BUT ARE YOU SET MISTER CHAIR YES YES SIR THANK YOU OF. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF ON THIS BILL AND THE EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HAD I AM TAKING THE AMENDMENT ON THE FILING NOTICE. THERE TO OTHER ITEMS. CYST THAT I'VE COMMITTED TO CAN YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH THE CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE STAFF THOSE ITEMS INCLUDE WORKING ON ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THAT OUTLINES THE OVERSIGHT THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS WHEN A NOTICE OF EXEMPTION. AND ANNA WE IS FILED AND WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS CULTIVATION ACTIVITIES AND HOW TO ENSURE. VITAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OCCURS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. YEAH I MEAN PIZZA THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT SENATOR- ONCE AGAIN GOOD PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS IT'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS THIS WEEK- I WANT TO- YOU KNOW BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH MY STAFF AND WITH ME ON THIS IS A- TEST. WE POINT IS THERE IS THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS. BUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO WORK WITH WITH YOU ON ON ON THE ON THESE COMPONENTS SO PROJECTS THAT I FEEL LIKE. WE HAD A PATH WE JUST. DIDN'T HAVE A PATH THAT WOULD GET US LANGUAGE BY TODAY RIGHT. I THINK WAS GOOD. THIS IS KID FISCAL. AND GOES THERE SO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE TO DEAL WITH THAT. YEP WHAT ARE THIS BILL AIMS TO STREET IN THE REAR VIEW AND APPROVAL OF ANNUAL CANNABIS LICENSES AND- AND TO MAYBE SYNTHESIZE IT. A RIGHT NOW A PROJECT. WE ARE ON THE LICENSE PROJECT IS REQUIRED TO DO SECRET TWICE FOR THE SAME PROCESS AND THE OAL OF THIS BILL. IS TO GET IT TO ONE. AND WE ARE FACING- THE SITUATION IN THE STATE. WHERE ARE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A REGULATED SYSTEM WORK AND WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF RESOURCES. WE WERE DEALING AND IT IS NOT. OUR FOR MR DOLLARS DISH BUT THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR. A GREGIS. ARE A BLAST OF STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT INVOLVED A MASSIVE DIVERSION OF WATER AND I KNOW SENATOR CAFIERO HAD A BILL ON ON DIVERSION OF WTER YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE. ON THE SUIT IT MORE SKETCHY PAST. INVOLVE PEOPLE BEING ARM. OUR OF AND THE REAL IDEA IS IF THIS IS GOING TO EXIST IT'S GOING TO EXIST IN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND NOW WE'VE DESIGNED A LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THAT IS REALLY HARD TO NAVIGATE AND IT SUCH THAT LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET A WE DID A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR SISTANCE IN THE CANNABIS LICENSE AND PROCESS BUT WE DID A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR REMEDIATION OF THE BAD STUFF AND- IT'S OF LIKE OUR- HASN'T BEEN. HIT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE ARE MAKING IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO EXIST IN THE WEEKLY MARKET. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO THE APPROVAL PROCESS INVOLVES COMPLYING WITH SEEK WELL WHETHER RESULTS IN APPLYING FOR AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION OR PREPARING THEM WROTE MORE ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL. REVIEWS SUCH AS A NEGATIVE DECLARATION OR AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WHEN THAT LOCAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED AND THE APPLICANT APPLIES FOR STATE COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSE THE STATE MUST COMPLY WITH SEQUEL. EVEN THOUGH FOR THE PURPOSE. OF THIS SEQUEL REVIEW THIS FOR THE PROJECT IS THE SAME AS IT WAS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OF THE DEPARTMENT CAN RELY ON A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COMPLETED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BUT MUST UTILIZE ITS OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT A PROCESS WHICH CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL. TO RE. SO DATA FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. OF THE STATE DESIGN. APPLICANTS IT WIGGLE COMPLIANCE BY UPCOMING DEADLINES IN THIS BILL SURE SIX WE'RE VIEW IS STREAMLINED. AND COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSES MAY BE ISSUED BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE DIEM. IS HE WILL NOT BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ONCE AND WHAT WE ARE WORKING OUT IN THE- IS MAKING SURE THE LOWER LEVEL. IS DONE IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY THAT IT TRULY DOES MEET WHAT WHAT OUR- NEED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WITH THAT- HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS KAREN WOODS AND THE DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE LICENSING AT KIVA AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT LET'S GO TO YOU KAREN ON THE PHONE LINES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ALAN BY SURVEYS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF MY NAME IS KAREN WATSON AND ON BEHALF OF CUBA IT IS A PLEASURE TO TESTIFIED TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN FORTY EIGHT BY SEVEN EARLIER. WHICH STREAMLINES THE PEOPLE CAN PROCESS THE NECESSARY TO OBTAIN AN ANNUAL CAMPUS LICENSE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. HE WAS FOUNDED IN TWENTY TEN AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OPERATORS IN THE STATE. BUT LIKE SO MANY OTHER CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARE DISTRIBUTION LICENSES REMAIN AND PROVISIONAL THAT. AND WHAT THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE OFFERS AND THE ABILITY TO OPERATE IT PROVIDES NO VESTED RIGHT OR DO YOU PROCESS. I MENTION THIS UP FRONT BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE THE CRITICAL CHANGE NEEDED TO TRANSITION THOUSANDS OF PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS. TO ANNUAL LICENSE HOLDERS. UNDESIGNATED A PER PROP SIXTY FOUR AND MARKERS THAT. CANNABIS LICENSING IS GOVERNED BY LOCAL CONTROL AND LICENSEES UNDERGO EXTENSIVE SEEK OVER A FEW OF THE LOCAL LEVEL AND FRANKLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BEST POSITIONED TO ANALYZE THE PROJECT POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. PROPERLY EVALUATE STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS AND MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT ANY NECESSARY MEDICATIONS. IF AN APPLICANT UNDERGOES PEOPLE REVERE IN A JURISDICTION THAT HAS FILED A NOTICE OF MOTION. FOR DETERMINATION FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF A NEGATIVE BACK OR A CERTIFICATE OF ANY I. R. THIS EFFECT TO THE COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY. AND THAT THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE PROJECT FORM FUNCTION OR OFFICE WHEN SEEKING A STATE ISN'T. IN THE LOCAL APPROVAL SHOULD SUFFICE TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S FOR IS THE LOOK AT THOUSANDS OF. LICENSEE HAVE WAY MANY YEARS TO TRANSITION TO AN ANNUAL LICENSE AND THE ONLY HOLD UP IS THE SAFETY FOR RUBIO. IT COSTS US OPERATORS TIME AND MONEY ACCORDING TO THE B. C. C. ROUGHLY 70% OF ALL LICENSES REMAIN IN PROVISIONAL STOP. ELIMINATING THE DUPLICATE OF REVIEW FOR PROJECTS THAT DO NOT POSE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WILL EXPEDITE THE APPROVAL OF THESE LIFE SAYS BOB HERTZBERG D. FOR UC'S AUTHORITY IT'S A PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEE FOR A VIEW ON THE PROJECT THAT REALLY NEED IT. LASTLY THE OVERWHELMING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CREATED BY CANNABIS PRODUCTION OCCURRED AND CHANNELS WHICH ARE. AND WHICH ARE ILLICIT AND REMAIN ENTIRELY UNAFFECTED BY THE SEQUEL RUBIO. SHORTENING THE TIME IT TAKES TO OBTAIN OF HANIEL AN ANNUAL LICENSE HOLDS IN STORE THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET REMAINS.

THE ASSET OF COMMERCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU AND MEMBERS. I KNOW I HAVE TO BILLS IN FRONT OF YOU AND SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS ONE IS SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE. HI YES WE ARE STARTING WITH- A LIST WITH. AT NO LET ME SEVENTH. THAN ERIC. LEVY SEVEN. SO IF I MAY ASK THAT WE START WITH HOW DO YOU LIKE TO START WITH. I HAVE A WITNESS WHO IS OUT OF. DATE AND IN SHORT IS COAST TIME AND SO JUST TO OKAY THAT'S- WITHOUT OBJECTION WILL WILL GO AHEAD AND DO ITEM NUMBER NINE THIS IS SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE. WHICH ONE. OKAY THEN YOU SHOULD PRESENT. OKAY MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT MY BILL SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE REASONABLE AND MUCH NEEDED REFORMS TO CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR CLIMATE POLLUTION SO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE ARE- CONTINUES TO RELY HEAVILY ON THIS POLICY WHILE DISMISSING SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT ITS PERFORMANCE. THAT COME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE INDEPENDENT ACADEMICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO MORE TO MEET ITS CLIMATE TARGETS AND THAT SOME POINT PORTENT BUT I CERTAINLY WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR PEOPLE LIVE NEAR THE OIL REFINERIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE LOS ANGELES AREA. AND REFINERIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE KNOW FROM RECENT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. AND EXPERT ADVISORY REPORTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS TOO MANY ALLOWANCES AND CARBON OFFSETS THAT IT'S TOO EASY FOR BIG POLLUTERS TO CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL. WORSE MANY OF THESE ASSETS AREN'T DELIVERING CLIMATE BENEFITS. WHAT THAT MEANS ON THE GROUND IS THAT YOUNG KIDS LIVING NEAR REFINERIES ARE GETTING ASTHMA MORE OFTEN. AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE TAKING THEM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM MORE OFTEN. MEANWHILE THE BURDEN OF AIR POLLUTION FROM FACILITIES SUBJECT TO CAP AND TRADE CONTINUES TO FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. MY BILL WOULD HELP ADDRESS THESE INJUSTICES WITH A SET OF PRACTICAL REFORMS FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. WE KNOW THAT THE R. WANTS TO LINK ITS PROGRAM WITH A SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN WASHINGTON STATE. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WASHINGTON LEGISLATORS HAVE STUDIED OUR PROGRAM CLOSELY IN THEIR BILL SPONSOR FORMER SENATOR CARLYLE. SAID THAT HE POURED OVER CRITICAL REPORTS AND CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IN DRAFTING THEIR LAW. AND THEY DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE LIVING NEXT TO MAJOR POLLUTERS. IN CALIFORNIA WE LET THESE COMPANIES INCREASED AIR POLLUTION WHATEVER THEY CLAIM CARBON OFFSETS CREDITS FROM EXTRA CARBON SUPPOSEDLY STORED IN A TREE OR METHANE THAT'S NOT EMITTED FROM A COAL MINE. THE WASHINGTON POLICY DECIDED THAT THE USE OF CARBON OFFSETS WON'T EXPAND THE TOTAL POLLUTION ALLOWED IN THEIR PROGRAM THEY WON'T LET OFFSET'S OUTSOURCE THE HARD WORK OF CLEANING UP THE AIR ONE WANTS TO BRING THE LESSONS WASHINGTON LEARN FROM CALIFORNIA BACK TO CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD CREATE TWO REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE MET BEFORE THEY ARE FORMALLY LINKS ITS PROGRAM WITH THE PROGRAM IN ANOTHER STATE FIRST. I WOULD NEED TO DO A REGULATORY CHECK UP ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AT LEAST ONCE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THIS IS A REASONABLE ASK IT'S BEEN MORE THAN FOUR YEARS SINCE THE LAST CHECKUP AND DESPITE EVIDENCE SHOWING THE PROGRAM IS OFF TRACK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THE FOR. UP EFFORTS UNTIL NEXT YEAR. SECOND ARE WOULD HAVE TO REDUCE THE PROGRAM WIDE SUPPLY POLLUTION ALLOWANCES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE USE OF CARBON OFFSETS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T OUTSOURCE THE POLLUTION REDUCTIONS ARE COMMUNITIES URGENTLY NEED. AGAIN THIS REQUIREMENT IS ALSO VERY REASONABLE IT'S ONE OF THE SPECIFIC REFORMS RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA'S EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL. SO WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS DR DANNY CULLEN WORD. WITH CARBON PLAN AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH- THIS INTERVIEW I MEAN TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH CENTER KYLE TODAY SO WE HAVE WE ARE GOING TO BE CONNECTING AFTERWARDS BUT I. WANT TO SAY THAT I AM INTERESTED TALKING WITH HIM AND INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AS A SMOKE A HOPEFULLY IF THIS MOVES FORWARD. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS COMPATIBILITY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA IF THE GOAL IS TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER STATES AND SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LINK IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. OKAY ALL RIGHT I DO WANT TO. I'VE GOT THREE BILLS AT THE SAME TIME UP AND SETTLING ON AN AD BUT- I DO I DO APPRECIATE YOU CONNECTING YEAH YEAH YEAH. I THINK I THINK THAT'S THE BASIS OF IT THE BASIS OF IT. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ARE. WORKING WITH OTHER STATES. YEAH THAT. THERE'S ARE YOU KNOW. THERE'S A SYMBIOSIS TO IT SO OKAY. ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE BILL YEP OKAY. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO DOCTOR CONGER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ALAN CAN YOU THE MEMBERS HERE THIS WEEKEND THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMEDY MEANWHILE WITH OUT OF STATE- I JUST WANT TO ADD A FEW MENTIONS IF YOU ADDITIONAL POINTS TO A FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE KAMAGRA TRADUCTION. B. TWO REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BILL I THINK ARE ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD THE FALLOUT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS- AND PROCESS- THE PROPOSAL TO TALK ABOUT FOR SOME TIME. THE IDEA OF A CHECK UP TO THE PROGRAM I WANT TO EMPHASIZE DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY NEW STEP. UP ON THE PROGRAM. ALL OF THE EXISTING STATUTORY CRITERIA THAT ALREADY APPLY. ASSEMBLY ASK THAT- THE PROGRAM BE REVIEWED IN LIGHT OF THOSE CRITERIA BECAUSE AGAIN. WE HAVE LOTS OF NEW INFORMATION. PROGRAMS THE LAST TIME THE CSU DONE. BY THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT SHE AND REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE DONE AND- WITH. THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON WHICH I SERVE- SO I JUST SORT OF LIKE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE NEW CHANGE OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE A QUESTION OF SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE INSISTENCE. IN ASKING THE PROGRAM IS ON TRACK I DIDN'T THE DENTIST. THE MOST CHANGES THE SECOND. MY RITESH OF THE BILLS. THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED CALIFORNIA TO FOLLOW WASHINGTON'S LEAD IN ADOPTING APPROACH. WASHINGTON IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO TAKE THE WASHINGTON STATE LAW- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- IT THE DESIGN GOAL WITHOUT REQUIREMENTS IS TO AUTOMATICALLY APPROVE THE APPROACH THE WASHINGTON STATE IS REQUIRED TO FIX. SUPPOSED TO BE AGNOSTIC AND FLEXIBLE WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECTION WASHINGTON STATE TAKES. APPRECIATING THAT PERFORMING WANNA SAY JUAN- AND IT HAD NO EFFECT ON THE- LANGUAGE BACK BECAUSE THE LINKING PROCESS. ONLY APPLIES TO NEW LINKIN PARK. AND I WANT TO ADD IS THAT THIS HAS. FLEX ON WHETHER JUST LOOK LIKE THE TURN OF THE BILL PUT. SIGNIFICANT CLICK. THAT WOULD REFLECT THE RESOURCES FOR THE BILLING TO CHOOSE ROLE FOR THE CAP AND TRADE FOR. AND THE BILL LAW TO THE OFFICER TO JOSS REQUIRED WITH THE REALMS OF POLICY PARAMETERS THE PART OF THE- ABOUT HIM CAREFUL DEFINING OUR PRO. TO GETTING TWENTY THIRTY PARK- WITH THAT- SENATOR AND THEN OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DR CURRENT PRESIDENT ALL RIGHT ANYWAY WHO WANTS A RAISE. VOICE OF FOR THE BILL AND- ON THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR THIS IS FOR SB THIRTY NINETY ONE. LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE DETAILS AT THIS TIME. WHAT'S GOING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND THERE ARE NO WINDING QUEUE AT THE MOMENT. OKAY ALL RIGHT I'M LET'S GO TO OPPOSITION ANYONE IN PERSON ONE RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL ON THE PHONE LINES MOTOR. YOU HAVE A SELECTED BEGIN OPPOSITION THIS PRESS ONE AND ZERO. YOU TO HAVE A LINE FOR EIGHTY SIX THESE GUYS. LARA HAIDER FROM ROCHELLE WELL I DON'T LIKE LOAN SHOULD HAVE ON THE TICKET SHOULD BE CHECKED TO MAKE SURE I HEARD THAT THE LORD SHALL BE. THANK OKAY THANK YOU HI ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE LINE FIVE OH FIVE DESPITE. HELLO I WAS TRYING TO BE ADDED TO STILL SUPPORT COLUMN- NAME IS SHERRY JOHNSON REPRESENTING ALL. OR GO THANK YOU. WELL NOT THAT ANYONE ELSE. AND WE HAVE A LINE FIVE SIXTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS QUITE MONEY IN STRATEGIC ADVISOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL EMISSIONS TRADING ASSOCIATION AND- ISSUES DO NOT BERKELEY WHERE I STUDY CARBON MARKETS JUST LIKE MAKE- MET MY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- WE PUT THE BILL MAKES IT HARDER TO LINK WHICH IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE GIVING OUT LINKING. CAN INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ALSO- FACILITATE ENHANCED AMBITION MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK IT ON OCCUPIES THE FIELD OF THE REGULATOR BY FOURTEEN- REGULATORY CHOICE IN WASHINGTON ON TO CALIFORNIA. MY VIEW IS THAT- THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO LINK IN PARTICULAR WHETHER CARBON OFFSET HAVE INTEGRITY I CAN HAVE MANY SOLUTIONS NOT JUST THE ONE PROPOSED IN THIS BILL AND THEREFORE IT'S BETTER LEFT BOBBY A REGULATORY DECISION FOR A LOT OF THE EXPERTISE IS HOUSE PLEASE REPEAT YOUR NAME INNER TIE YOUR POSITIONING AND I'M SO SORRY WE DON'T HAVE YOU ON THE LIST. NO WORRIES CLEAN MONEY. STRATEGIC ADVISOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL EMISSIONS TRADING ASSOCIATION. A NONPROFIT BUSINESS ASSOCIATION THAT THE COURTS KERR MARKETS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE WATER FOR THE LAST WEEK GREAT OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OF WHAT THE KEY. GREAT OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. I CENTER STERN. YES THANK YOU- JUST TRY TO READING THROUGH THE BILL RIGHT NOW I KNOW WE GOT A LOT GOING ON THIS WEEK SO- POLICIES FOR NOT BEING BETTER VERSED ON THIS BUT- IS THERE. WHAT WHAT PREVENTS THE AIRBOARD FROM DOING THIS UNDER EXISTING LAW IS THERE ANYTHING THAT PREVENTS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FROM. ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS AND THEY JUST HAPPENED. THIS WOULD FORCE THEM TO. THEY COULD UNDER EXISTING LAW. OKAY- YEAH I MEAN MY CONCERN ABOUT THE MEASURE. I THE IDEA OF HAVING FORMAL REGULATION REVIEW SEEMS. STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SORT OF STRUGGLING POLITICAL EFFORTS GOING ON IN MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA THE DON'T HAVE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS OR ANY MARKET BASED MECHANISMS I MEAN REGGIE ON THE NORTHEAST THIS IS- REALLY HARD. REALLY HARD SLOGS FOR STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA TO GET INVOLVED AND- AND OTHERS SO MY CONCERN IS THAT. I DON'T WANT TO. PUT ANY DETERRENT IN STATE LAW FOR SAY A BRIEF STATE LIKE PENNSYLVANIA THAT'S GOING TO. TRY TO PUT TO. PUT SOME KIND OF CARBON MARKET TOGETHER BUT THEY- WERE SAYING- WAIT FOR WE'RE NOT GONNA LINK WITH YOU- OR WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCESS. IN PLACE WITH. I. E. MAC- AND SORT OF. PUT THEM THROUGH THE WRINGER AS IT WERE WHEN IF THEY'RE WILLING TO STEP OUT AND MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS I GET WHAT'S GOING ON WASHINGTON- STATE AND IF THEY'RE TAKING CHANCES. THERE TO- BUT BUT THE PROVISION THAT ACTUALLY IT'S IN AND MICROMANAGES HOW THE AIR BOARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF EMISSIONS ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF OFFSETS INVOLVED IN LINKAGE I THINK WE'RE SORT OF CONFLATING LINKAGE AND OFFSETS TO THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS WE TAKE OFFSETS FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS BUT- MY UNDERSTANDING IS LINKAGE HAS TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL ALLOWING MARK. SO MUCH THE OFFSETS. I'M ALWAYS HESITANT TO DO VERY NARROW- TINKERING WITH. A REALLY IMPORTANT STATUTE THAT HAS HUGE MARKET IMPLICATIONS AND WHAT THIS MIGHT DO TO THE MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW IF WE- IF WE TO PASS THIS SO I GET THE PEOPLE OF YES WITHOUT THE CURRENT PROGRAM MR NINE HEARD YOUR LEAD WITNESS AND I KNOW HE'S HAD ONGOING ISSUES WITH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND WE HEAR HIM LOUD AND CLEAR THAT. BUT I GUESS I'M JUST I'M CONCERNED THAT PICKING THIS NARROW APPROACH AND DECIDING WHAT THAT IS NOW THAT WE COULD PROBABLY DEAL BETTER WITH THAT THROUGH THE SCOPING PLAN- AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE DEALT WITH SOME OF THIS IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. I DON'T KNOW IF THE GOVERNOR IS NOT PUTTING ANY OF THESE CERTIFICATIONS IN WRITING OR FOR NOT BEFORE PROPOSING OVER THE LINK WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE NOT HAD A FORMAL REGULARLY REVIEW. BUT YEAH I JUST FEEL WOULD PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE OTHER THAN. TRY TO FOR THE AIRPORTS- SO. THAT'S MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW BUT I'M HAPPY IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND OR HAVE YOUR PLEA WITNESS RESPONDED THAT QUICK NO I'M- HAPPY TO HEAR SOME FEEDBACK. I'M JUST GENERALLY RECOVER. IN A MARKET THAT'S A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CARBON MARKET WITH GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS THAT WE WANT A STABLE AS POSSIBLE ANYTHING THAT DESTABILIZES THAT OR IN ANYWAY PUTS A WALL UP AROUND CALIFORNIA. AND SAYS WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN LINKING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT. I WANT TO SHARE AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW. ANYWAY THAT THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S MY QUICK REACTION BUT MAYBE I MAYBE MISSED READING THIS AND OVERSTATING IT SO I'M I'M I'M HAPPY TO BE- DISSUADED OR OR WRONG. AT THAT'S THAT'S THE CONCERN THIS POINT. OKAY GREAT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MY LEAD WITNESS RESPOND. YES I THINK TO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE BILL WAS DRAFTED DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ACTION FROM THE AIRPORT SO ONE OF THE OPTIONS THE AIRPORT COULD TAKE. TAKE NO ACTION AGAINST ME THE PROGRAM EXACTLY AS A SUSPENDED FINE ORDER FOR THAT HARD TO BE LIKE THE REQUIREMENTS THE BILL WITH APPLY IF AND ONLY THAT IF THE BOARD WANTS TO MAKE A NEW BIKE HELMET JURISDICTION OF THAT IS MOST APPROXIMATELY IN UNDER POTENTIAL CONSIDERATION WITH WASHINGTON STATE AND THE LONG SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN THE MARKET ROLES WOULD BE TO ADOPT PROTECTION WASHINGTON IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO. SO THOSE ARE CHANGES I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT BUT THAT IT'S BASICALLY BRINGING CAL. WASHINGTON OKAY AND ONE OF THE OP BEFORE WOULD PREFER ON THE BILL THE IT IS TO TAKE NOT AT ALL SO IF THE BOARD WERE TO SAY RIGHT DIRECTION WANTED TO THEY CAN CONTINUE THE ONE THAT THE CURRENT OFF BUT BE ELIGIBLE TO MAKE A WITHIN PROGRAM IN THAT INSTANCE I'M- BUT IF ANOTHER STATE WANTS TO OUT. AND OCT. LAN FROM AND I MEANT PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE THAT THAT GUY IS BRAVE VETOED A OF ITS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO BLOCK THEM FROM JOINING THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE IN THE NORTHEAST BUT IF WE WANTED TO REWARD THAT KIND OF CLIMATE BRAVERY ON THE EAST COAST AND LOOK AT LINKAGES THERE. WE'VE NOW DESIGNED OF THIS SORT OF PRECONDITION AROUND A WASHINGTON. PARITY IDEA BUT- ARE WE BUSY LOCKING THE AIRPORT INTO TRYING TO FIND PARITY WITH THE WITH ONE JURISDICTION BUT THEN IF ANOTHER JURISDICTION HAD A DIFFERENT SORT OF FRAMEWORK WOULD IT. WOULD PRECLUDE US IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING IT WOULD PRECLUDE US FROM LOOKING WITH THAT JURISDICTION- I BELIEVE IT WOULD ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THE EAST COAST RESTRICTIONS. LEVINE AND PARTICIPATED IN A MARKET THAT I THINK IS UNLIKELY TO BE LINKABLE UNDER CURRENT MARKET STANDARDS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT IS PRETTY FAR ALONG IN THE CONVERSATION OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON TO AN ECONOMY WIDE PROGRAM LIKE THAT SO I. WOULD ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. AND I. I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT HAS LIMITED THE FACT BUT- THAT'S DENIED OLDER. FOR THANKS WITH SO YOU I'M ADDRESS THE BROADER THE BROADER CONCERNS BEING RAISED BY CENTER STERN WHICH IS. WHY WOULD WE WANT TO HARM OUR ABILITY TO. I HAD TO IT TOOK TO LINK WITH STATES THAT ARE REALLY STEPPING UP. WHAT SENATOR I THINK AGAIN THERE ARE MAKING PROVISION IN THE END OF STATE LAW RIGHT NOW THAT REQUIRE US TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE LINKED INTO COMPARABLY AMBITIOUS PROGRAMS. SUPPORT STANDARD RT EXISTENCE LONG AND I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CONSIDERATION THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING WITH JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE AGAIN COMPARABLY FISH PROGRAMS. THE WASHINGTON. MORE THAN OURS IS GOOD- FOR MIKE OF VIEW- I THINK THE PRODUCT IS DO WE WANT TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WORKS WELL IF WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DINING OUT OF HOME OR WE MORE INTERESTED IN COLLECTING LOOKING EXPERIENCES AND- TRYING TO GET THE PROGRAM UNDER. WITH CLEAR TO FIND WHAT IT'S GOING TO IT A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN THIS WOULD BE I THINK THE WAY TO ENCOURAGE THAT. BUT CAN I TAKE YOUR POINT IF THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO LINK WITH A MATTER OF MONTHS FORWARD. INCREASING STANDARDS FOR LINKING WILL NECESSARILY DISLIKE THAT. BABY YOU YOU FEEL- BUT YOU FELT YOU FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT A STRONG PROGRAM. LIKE WASHINGTON'S WILL NOT BE. I SUBSTANTIVELY. BY THIS BILL THEY ARE BILLING TO MY ATTENTION. MY EDUCATION TO REQUIREMENTS THE PROCEDURAL CHECKUPS THE AIRPORT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO THE LINK AND THE CHANGES IN THE SECOND REQUIREMENT WOULD BE TO MATCH THE WASHINGTON STATE COACH WASHINGTON STATE BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED APPROACHES BECAUSE STATURE PARTY REQUIRES THE SAME KIND OF. SURE THAT WOULD BE MY INTERPRETATION OF THE AND DRAFTED. OKAY- CENTER CASKEY. SO I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL BECAUSE I LIKE THE BILL AND I WOULD INTERPRET ME FIRST SO EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS REGGIE ALL READ SHE DEALS WITH IS THE UTILITIES THEY DO NOT HAVE COVERED ENTITIES POWER PLANTS SIX ALL THE WITH THIS POWER PLANTS IT'S A MUCH SMALLER CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS TO SPEAK OF THEN WHAT WE'RE DOING SO. BUT BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SO MANY. SOMEBODY- EMITTER CENTER ADMITTING IT SO IT'S AS MUCH SKINNIER LITTLE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE WASHINGTONHAS COVERED ENTITIES LIKE WE'D GET THE LARGEST INDUSTRIAL EMITTERS THAT THEY HAVE AND WHAT THEY'VE DESIGNED IS A CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM IF REUVEN CARLYLE WERE HERE HE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT CAPEN TREE WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TRADE THESE ALLOWANCES WE WANT YOU TO INVEST AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY YOUR BILL. IS BEFORE YOU CAN OFFSET WHICH YES THE CARBON MARKETS THEY'RE OUT THERE THEY'RE LISTENING TO WHAT WE'RE GOING ON HERE YOU CAN'T TRIPS HAVE TO IN THE- YOUR FIX FACILITIES YOU DON'T GET AND IF YOU DON'T THEN YOU DON'T THAT'S WHAT THE MAP OF. STAFF REPORT ADEQUATELY EXPLAINS THAT YOU YOU HAVE ONLY GET A 5% LESSER 10% DEPENDING ON WHAT THE OFFSET IS OF YOU MEETING YOUR ALLOWANCES SO THIS PROGRAM WE DECIDED IN TWENTY TWELVE IT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE STATIC. AS I READ FORMAL REGULATORY OF PROCESS ONCE WASHINGTON HAS PASSED YOUR BILL WHAT WE'RE AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LINKAGE BUSINESS SO THEY HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND SAY CAN WE LINK IT IN CAN WE NOT WE'RE NOT. IS SO IF IT IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE STATIC IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE EVOLVE AND IF YOU HAVE A BETTER CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THAT SAYS YEAH NOT GOING. TO GIVE YOU A CREDIT ON THESE ALLOW ON THESE OFFSETS THAT YOU YOU'RE NOT REDUCING EMISSIONS UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS THEN WE- IT INCREASES OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND- SO WE GET MORE INFORMATION. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MEET TWENTY THIRTY. MEASURES THEN YOU WOULD THINK YOU WANT TO TIGHTEN UP. THE BED I'M I THINK IT'S- HE. STROKE OF BRILLIANCE THAT YOU DIDN'T SET NEW STANDARDS BECAUSE I COULDN'T CONTROL MYSELF NOT TO THE SET TO SET NEW STANDARDS AND IT ALSO THAT BUT I WAS JUST IN TROUBLE RIGHT BUT NO BUT BY JUST HAVING THEM GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND HARMONIZE THE WASHINGTON- PROGRAM THEN I THINK THAT IN WITH THE GET A JAIL DON'T HAVE TO DO IT THINK THE GOING TO END UP. THE GOOD THIRTY IT- BUT PROGRAM IS PROVEN AT THE STATE IT'S WHAT CAN HAPPEN TRADE WAS FOR TO BE WE IT. MADE ALL THE MOST AND THEN OTHER STATES HAVE COPY YET AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE NEXT STATE THAT WANTS TO JOIN US IT. DOING EVEN BETTER THAN WASHINGTON AND THEY'RE GONNA SAY THE OR THEY'RE GONNA DO THEY'RE GONNA ASK TO BE LINKED TO US BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE- THIRD ALLOWANCES FOR THAT THAT WE HAVE IN AND ALSO MAYBE OPEN UP BUT OFF NEEDS FOR OFFSETS BE DONE. AND IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS SO. THE QUESTION THERE BUT THERE IS A MOTION. OKAY TO MOVE BY- THERMA CASKEY- YEAH I MEAN ONE YOU KNOW I MEAN ONE THING CENTER STERN YOU KNOW- IF SO ONE THING TO CONSIDER IF THEY'RE TOO MANY ALLOWANCES IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET AND THEN WE LINK WITH ANOTHER STATE LIKE WASHINGTON. NOW SUDDENLY A HEART ALLIANCES AS OUR OUR ALLOWANCES AND BECOME THEIR PROBLEM TO- SO WE GOT IT THE PARTLY IS ABOUT TRYING TO CLEAN UP OUR OWN HOUSE. BEFORE ENGAGING THE SUN PARTNERSHIPS- HIS EXCELLENCY THAT RIGHT WELL THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE BILL RIGHT ISN'T. AND THAT'S THE- ISSUE. OKAY I IT'S THE MOVE I CENTER CASKEY SEEING NO MORE QUESTIONS I IN MY CLOTHES THAT WAS THE CLOSE OKAY ACTUALLY I HAVE A OKAY HMM. THANK YOU ARE SECTOR PLEASE ADD OFFICE COLOR ITEM NUMBER NINE SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE BY SENATOR COME LONGER THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN HI ALAN I. FELT THEY KNOW. DALLIED NO CONCERN. SKINNER SKINNER AYE STERN. STERN NOT VOTING Y. CASKEY ARE CASKEY I CRAM I WILL HOLD IT OPEN FOR FOCUSED ON ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO YOUR PREVIOUS SIDE CENTER THIS IS ITEM NUMBER EIGHT THIS IS A SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN OKAY GREAT THANK YOU- HERE TODAY A DAY TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN IT CREATES A PILOT PROGRAM IN LA AND VENTURA. RECYCLED TEXTILE IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND I KNOW ALL OF YOU ALL CAN RELATE BECAUSE THE YOU ARE THE MOST FASHIONABLE MEMBERS IN THE SENATE. ASHLEY COMES AT A HUGE COST REFERENCE GROUPS. BASHIN COMES AT A HUGE COST TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES PEOPLE AND THE ECOSYSTEM FROM WATER POLLUTION TO TOXIC CHEMICAL USE THE CLOTHES AND ACCESSORIES WE WHERE HARM OUR WORLD THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS THE THIRD LARGEST MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN THE WORLD AFTER THE AUTOMOBILE AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES. AS OF TWENTY TWENTY THERE ARE FIFTY GLOBAL COMPANIES WITHIN FASHION RETAIL AND TEXTILE CHAINS THAT HAVE COMMITTED TO THE SCIENCE BASED TARGETS OF THE PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT. AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO CLIMATE CHANGE THESE COMPANIES ARE AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES FACING THE INDUSTRY INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OVER PRODUCTION AND WASTAGE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE FASHION SECTOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME TWO POINT ONE BILLION METRIC TONS OF GHGS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT 4% OF THE GLOBAL TOTAL. DOES THAT IN CONTEXT THE FASHION INDUSTRY EMITS ABOUT THE SAME QUANTITY OF GHGS PER YEAR AS THE ENTIRE ECONOMIES ARE FRANCE GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM COMBINED. THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IS NOW PURCHASING 60% MORE ITEMS OF CLOTHING THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO. WITH THAT X. IN THEM THIS COMES AT A HUGE COST 20% OF GLOBAL WASTE WATER COMES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF GARMENTS WHILE COTTON FARMING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S INSECTICIDE ABOUT LANDFILLS OR INCINERATORS AND INCREDIBLY 60% OF TEXTILES ARE THROWN AWAY WITHIN A YEAR OF BEING MADE. SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN CREATES A PILOT PROGRAM WITH A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY TO DESIGN RECYCLABILITY STRATEGIES COLLECTING RESELL USED GARMENTS. PROMOTE AND EDUCATE THE USE OF RECYCLED POST CONSUMER TEXTILE FIBERS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO MAKE THE FASHION INDUSTRY SUSTAINABLE BY REDUCING WASTE RECYCLING AND REUSING RESOURCES AND APPLYING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY THINKING TO THE INDUSTRY.

TWO OF WHICH ARE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES I WORKING WITH LA SANITATION OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IS SENDING OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS OF COMMERCIAL TEXTILES TO THE LANDFILL EVERY. THE EQUIVALENT OF MILLION METRIC TONS OF GHGS AND THAT'S JUST COMMERCIAL TEXTILES AND THAT'S JUST WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS. SO I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE'RE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THE LOCALLY FUNDED PILOT PROJECTS AS WELL. THANK YOU. AWESOME ALL RIGHT.

REYES PROUD. SENATE EFFORTS TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM FOCUSED ON DESIGNING FABRIC RECYCLING STRATEGIES COLLECTING AND RESELLING HIS GARMENTS AND PROMOTING THE USE OF RECYCLED POST CONSUMER TEXTILE FIBERS. BURKE CITED FOR THIS PILOT TO HELP INFORM NOT ONLY HOW TO CREATE A TEXTILE RECYCLING PROGRAM IN THE STATE. HOW TO MAKE IT SCALABLE SUSTAINABLE LONG LASTING I WANT TO THANK SENATOR CALM WATER FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT US SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN THANK YOU. IF YOU.

THANK YOU CARE CENTER CALM WATER I'D LIKE TO BE AN AUTHOR. AND I REALLY- GLAD THAT THEORY AND ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S AN OFFICE THAT NOTES THAT- NOT ONLY IS WHATEVER NOW WE'RE PRODUCING A LOT OF THESE TEXTILES THAT PART THAT ARE GOING INTO LANDFILLS BUT- THAT YOU KNOW WE- THERE WERE A FEW OTHER BILLS AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT DETAILS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THESE. MICROFIBERS AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT ARE- WHATEVER IN CONTRIBUTING TO THAT IN THAT. BABIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF THESE MICROFIBERS IN THERE YOU KNOW BAY BOTTLE IT JUST SAYS- WHEN HE CAUGHT- FORGET WHAT THAT TERM IS FOR WHEN. BODY DURING YOUR PRIME NUMBER BUT ANYWAY. AND NOW WE KNOW THAT IT IS A LOT FROM. IT IT'S NOT JUST THE BLANKETS OR THAT IT'S FROM ALL THESE CLOTHES. AND IT'S IN THE REMEMBER MEANT IT'S A PHYSICALLY IN US IT'S- YOU KNOW PRETTY SOON THEY SAY YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE EATING. WE DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING WE'RE JUST BECAUSE WERE IN JUST WERE BRIEFING AT THE WHOLE BIT. ANYWAY SO THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THE OTHER THING. THAT IT TO KERR TO ME THAT WE HAVE THESE GOALS NOW REGARDING DIVERSION FROM LANDFILL FOR ORGANIC WASTE AND THE PURPOSE TO AVOID METHANE. THAT ANY OF THESE MATERIALS THAT ARE. FOSS FUEL BASED. BREAKING DOWN IN THE LAND PRETTY- NOTHING THEY ARE THE SAME AS IF WE PUT FOOD WASTE THEY MIGHT TAKE LONGER TO BREAK DOWN BUT THEY'RE THE SAME AS IF WE PUT PAPER FOOD WASTE OR THOSE OTHER ORGANICS IN A LANDFILL SO THERE'S YOU KNOW MULTIPLE. FORTUNATELY NEGATIVE DIMENSIONS TO THE FACT THAT I LOVE CLOTHES ANYWAY- THERE ARE MULTIPLE OFFICE STAND. THERE AND- YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO OVER TIME THINK ABOUT HOW TO EVEN PREVENT THIS FROM GETTING INTO LANDFILLS SO- ANYWAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BILL. BY TO BE A CO AUTHOR NORMAN THE BILL. Q. SENATE- I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE WITNESSES IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST QUORUM I'M VERY FAST IT ABOUT THIS BILL AMENDS REPORTED I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA I WANT. THE IT MAY. BUT CAUGHT MUST HIS CAUGHT MOMENT KNOW THERE'S LOT OF- WILHELM SYNTHETIC IN OUR CLOTHES BUT IT CAN IT CAN NOT BE REPURPOSE LIKE WE DO- PAPER WE CAN TAKE PAPER WE CAN RECYCLE AND WE COULD PUT RIGHT BACK IN THE PAPER AGAIN IS THERE IS THERE ANY- TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR LIKE I KNOW COTTON IS. YOU KNOW. YES A LOT OF THOSE NATURAL. THROUGH MECHANICAL RECYCLING PROCESS. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MECHANICAL RECYCLERS IN STATE HOPEFULLY A FUTURE BILL COULD INCENTIVIZE THAT BUT- A LOT OF THE MOST MECHANICAL WRIST LIKE. FOR COTTON ANOTHER NATURAL FIBERS ARE. EAST COAST MEXICO SPAIN INDIA. YEAH THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY EXISTS. AND GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THESE. FIBERS IN USE WITHOUT USING TOO MUCH ENERGY INTO MUCH WATER TO. YOU WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION AT THE WHAT WHAT MECHANICAL. RECYCLING PROVIDES BASICALLY SHREDDING AND RE TWISTING THE FIBERS INTO YARN. WELL IN QUESTION I SEE GOOD WILL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I'M ASSUMING THAT WHEN WE'RE USING THE TERM RECYCLE IN THIS CASE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CREATING A COLLECTION SYSTEM BUT THAT IT PROBABLY AND I HOPE THIS IS TRUE INCLUDES POTENTIALLY REDUCE BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE LIKE GOODWILL INDUSTRIES THEIR INTENTION WOULD BE TO. AERIAL AT USABLE AND OF COURSE THAT WE HAVE THREE ARTISTS BUT THEY ALSO GAMES REUSE RECYCLE YEAH THEY ALSO GET. I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT WE GO AND DROP OFF A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF TO GOODWILL AND MAYBE THEY USE MAYBE THEY CAPTURE LIKE 30% OF WHAT'S DROPPED OFF. AND THEN THE REST SORRY THE CLOSURE WILL ACTUALLY AND IF THEY'RE ABLE TO RESELL IT AND SO THOSE THAT WHAT ITEMS. CAP IS STILL IN UP IN LANDFILL. SO THIS IS A- BECAUSE THEY STILL GREEN NO I BY RESALE FOR SURE- SO THIS WHAT IMPACT THIS. BUT WE'D STILL KNOW THAT MANY ITEMS ARE STILL BEING DISCARDED AND THEY'RE NOT. PLACE IN IN A SPACE WHERE THEY CAN BE RECYCLED. AND GOOD WILL IS OUR GRANT PARTNER WITH ONE OF THE RECOVERY PILOTS WHERE WE ARE ESTABLISHING A REPAIR ACADEMY. AMENDING SOME OF THOSE. TO ACTUALLY GET THOSE GARMENTS BACK INTO USE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DUMPING THEM ON SECOND HAND CLOTHING MARKETS THAT DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES. THIS YEAR WE HAVE AS AN AUGUSTA WAS CORRECTLY THERE'S A GREAT LITTLE BREAKDOWN- OF KARAKUL NUMBERS ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR ANALYSIS AND RESOLD 30% CUT DOWN TO MAKE WIPING CLOTHS AND RAGS 20% CONVERTED TO RECYCLE FIBERS. AND LANDFILLS HERE. I WONDER WHAT THE OVERSEAS NUMBERS END UP LOOKING LIKE THAT'S THE HALF OF IT BUT. OKAY YES IT OF COURSE HAVE ONE LAST COMMENT.

THIS BILL SB TWELVE OH THREE IS BY HAVING THE STATE GOVERNMENT SAID EXAMPLE BY GETTING TO NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ITSELF BEFORE ASKING EVERYONE ELSE THE STATE TO DO SO. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN LEADING THE WORLD IN REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS AND ASCETICAL FOR THE WHOLE STATE BEING AS YOUR BY TWENTY. OF FORTY FIVE WE'RE ASKING OUR COMPANIES AND OUR CITIZENS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDUCE EMISSIONS DRAMATICALLY. IN ORDER TO HIT THAT TARGET.

I CAN ALWAYS THE CONCERN AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED PLANS FOR GETTING TO NET ZERO AND IT WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ACHIEVING THAT CIRCLE ONCE THEY DO SO. PASS THIS BILL IS NOT MAKING A BINDING COMMITMENT TO NET ZERO. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE OR COMMITTING TO UNKNOWN FUTURE BUDGET EXPENDITURES. WHAT SHOULD YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE HOW FAR AND HOW FAST TO GO TO FUTURE BUDGET PROCREATION ONCE AS PLANS ARE DEVELOPED.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I AM PRESENTING S. B. THIRTEEN NINETEEN ON BEHALF OF CENTER GROVE. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUGGEST AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE THE BILL AND AMENDMENTS IN MINUTES IN COMMENTS TWO THREE AND FOUR THAT CLARIFY A NARROW THE MONITORING REPORTING PROPOSALS. WE WILL WHAT WE WILL BE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS. EACH YEAR CALIFORNIANS CONSUME ONE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A DAY THAT'S ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BARRELS A YEAR. BUT ONLY A HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION BARRELS WERE PRODUCED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BY CALIFORNIA WORKERS. WE IMPORT THE REST OF THAT OIL WHICH IS TRANSPORTED HERE MOSTLY ON HUGE TANKER SHIPS. THE AMOUNT WE SPEND ON IMPORTED OIL IS IT ENORMOUS. IF OIL IS PRICED AT A HUNDRED DOLLARS A BARREL CALIFORNIANS PAY FIFTY BILLION A YEAR TO IMPORT THE OIL WE NEED TO USE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WITH FOREIGN OIL IMPORTS WE HAVE PLACED CALIFORNIA'S ANY ENERGY SECURITY INTO THE HANDS OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY HOSTILE TO CALIFORNIA'S USE WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN RIGHTS. LABOR RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS BUSINESS WITH ACCOUNT FOR TWO THIRDS. OF THE FOREIGN OIL WE IMPORT THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BARRELS. WELL DAYS OR A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BARRELS OF OIL YEAR. THESE COUNTRIES ARE ECUADOR SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAQ. ALL THE IMPORTED OIL IS BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA BY SIX HUNDRED TANKER SHIPS A YEAR THOSE TANKER SEND MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. EVERY YEAR FROM THE FUEL THEY CONSUME TO POWER THE NEEDS TO OUR AND THE POWER THEY NEED THEY NEED TO OFFLOAD- THIS BILL. MUCH OF THE OR IT COULD BE REPLACED BY CALIFORNIA'S IN STATE. PRODUK PRODUCERS PROVIDING CALIFORNIA JOBS IF WE WERE ALLOWED TO EXPAND PRODUCTION. THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS OPERATE UNDER THE MOST STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IN THE WORLD. SB THIRTEEN NINETEEN WOULD SIMPLY IMPLORE THE LEGISLATURE TO REALIZE THAT MUCH OF THE CRUDE OIL IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA COMES FROM FOREIGN NATIONS. WITH CHEMISTRY WITH DEMONSTRATED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND FOREIGN NATIONS THAT HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS LOWER THAN THOSE IN CALIFORNIA. THESE MEASURES WERE ALL TO REQUIRE A CAL JIM TO REPORT ON ITS WEBSITE THE AMOUNT OF PARTICULATE MATTER RELEASED INTO THE AIR FROM OIL TANKER SHIPS EMISSIONS. IN AN EFFORT TO HIGHLIGHT THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS FROM THE STATE'S DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL. CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE READY TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR CALIFORNIA OIL. MORE MORE THAN A THOUSAND JOIN PERMITS ARE CURRENTLY AWAITING APPROVAL AT CAL JIM AND FIFTY FIVE YOU I SEE PERMITS HAVE BEEN AWAITING FOR APPROVAL FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS. APPROVAL OF THESE PERMITS WOULD EXPAND PRODUCTION IN IN STATE REDUCING FOR THEM FOREIGN IMPORTS. GENERATE GENERATE THOUSANDS OF HIGH PAYING JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS IMPROVE OUR STATE'S ENERGY SECURITY AND BE DONE UNDER THE MODE THE WORLD'S MOST STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. SB THIRTEEN NINETEEN WILL HOPEFULLY START A PROCESS TO BRING BACK TO CALIFORNIA THE THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES DUE TO THE SHARE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AS WE RESPECT. AT ALL RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS MAYOR THE MAYOR OF TOP OF TAFT MISTER DAVE NORA AND SEAN WALLENSTEIN FROM CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S I THINK THE MERITS ON THE COASTLINE. M. YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY WELCOME MISTER MAHER WE'VE IN THE PROJECT FRENCH HAVE YEAH AND WE'VE BEEN LISTEN WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT YOU ON NPR. THE MAN TALKING ABOUT OIL INTO. YEAH YOU MAY PROCEED. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE CHAIR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH YOU ALL. THE BILL THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS ABOUT ACTUALLY TAKING STOCK IN WHAT OUR DECISION IS HUGE TO US IN THE AFFECTED THOSE DECISIONS. BEYOND OUR BORDERS I MEAN WE ARE STATE CONSUME A GREAT DEAL OF CONTROLLING THEM. AND YET EVEN THOUGH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE ONLY IMPORTED FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT OF ALL THE OIL THAT WE USE. CALIFORNIA FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TODAY THAT NUMBER IS CLOSER TO SIXTY IVE PERCENT. WE USED FOR HIM AND HE WILL. HI YEAH LIKE IS TALKED ABOUT IN BILL THE SOURCE OF PETROLEUM FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE IGNORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS AFFECTS THAT WE ACTUALLY FINANCE ECUADOR IS CURRENTLY OUR LARGEST PROVIDER OF IMPORTED OIL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ECUADOR THEY'RE IN- SEE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH CHINA. I DIDN'T. ACTUALLY DRILLING AND PRODUCING OIL IN ECUADOR MUCH TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND INDIGENOUS PERSONNEL. WHAT ARE USED TO BE THE GREATEST CARTONS THANK NATURAL CARBON SINKS IN THE FACE OF THE GLOBE AND IS NOW A CARBON EMITTER. WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PURCHASING SOME 60% OF ALL THE OIL THAT IS EXPORTED FROM ECUADOR. WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE FINANCING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE AMAZON RAINFOREST WELL WE CHOOSE TO FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING GREEN RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR WHAT WE IMPORT UNFORTUNATELY FROM RUSSIA. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL GOING ON IN THE WORLD THESE DAYS IN RUSSIA BEING AT THE FOREFRONT A LOT OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN MISSOURI'S. THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. CALIFORNIAN PORTED ON AVERAGE FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL AND PRODUCT A DAY. EVERY DAY FROM RUSSIAN. SO WE DID WAS HELP FEEL FILL THEIR THEIR WAR CHEST AND BY PROXY THAN WE ARE THEN HELPING FINANCE HUMAN MISERY AND DESTRUCTION TAKING PLACE IN RUSSIA WE AS A STATE. OTHER THAN THIS IF WE'RE GONNA LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO. THE REALIZATION OF IMPACT ON THE CLIMATE WE HAVE GOT TO LOOK BEYOND OUR BORDERS WE HAVE GOT TO TAKE STOCK. IN THE ACTIONS THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE FOR THE EFFECTS OF THOSE ACTIONS. GLOBALLY THAT IS WHO WE ARE AND THAT IS THE WAY WE SHOULD LEAD WHERE OUR WORDS FELLA SINGLE STORY OUR ACTIONS UNFORTUNATELY HELD A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY. WHAT BETTER THAN THAT NINE WE CAN DO BETTER WE PRODUCE OIL RIGHT HERE AND STAY CALIFORNIA UNDER THE MOST STRINGENT STANDARDS AND PUT PEOPLE TO WORK WE DON'T VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS. VARMINT CALIFORNIA IS TRANSITION TO A GREENER FUTURE WE HAVE BEEN FOR DECADES YOU WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT WITHOUT DESTRUCTION I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPONSIBLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

ALAN ALL RIGHT BATES. VALLEY DALLY I'D CONSOLIDATE. SKINNER SKINNER AYE STERN. RECOUNTS SKI. HI THE CASKET GUY RIGHT. I THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALI. ARE LET'S GO T. TODDLE TIME NEXT TUESDAY ANNOUNCES JOINTLY AUTHORED BILL. I WILL GO TO ITEM ELEVEN THIS IS S. B. TWELVE NINETEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY- TURN MEMBERS. SO I I'M SURE THAT YOU ALL HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE JUST THE BREAKING NEWS YESTERDAY RIGHT THAT THERE'S SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE FACED WATER RESTRICTIONS AND SEEM LIKE EVER BEFORE IT COULD VERY WELL BE IN A SITUATION LIKE. YOU KNOW MANY THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND WHILE I WOULD LIKE TO BLAME THIS ON. THE DROUGHT ALONE- I I'D BE DISHONEST. AT IT'S JUST ONE OF SEVERAL FACTORS FROM LACK OF STORAGE TO DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IN MY HUMBLE OPINION IT IS A LARGE PART DUE TO. AN ANTIQUATED OF A WATER SYSTEM THAT HAS LED TO THE YOU KNOW THE MISSED THE MISMANAGEMENT OF OUR MOST PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCE FOR INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE A- POINT OF NOTING THIS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE I PARTNERED UP WITH A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE WATER THAT'S NOT FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND SUBJECT TO A VERY HAPPY AND THANKFUL TO HAVE CENTER COURT CORTEZ YOU HERE WITH ME TO- SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS A JOINT AUTHOR OF SB TWELVE NINETEEN. BUT WATER SCARCITY IS YOU KNOW AS I SAID BEFORE IT'S NOT JUST A CENTRAL VALLEY ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA ISSUE IT'S A GLOBAL ISSUE IN. REPORT AFTER REPORT TELLS US THAT WATER. SCARCITY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT REALLY IN IT AND A NEXUS WITH FRAMEWORK WITH FOOD HEALTH ENERGY AND SECURITY ALL PART OF IT. IN FACT THE TWENTY TWELVE COMMITTEE INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT REPORT ON THE STATE OF GLOBAL WATER SECURITY INDICATED THAT. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THIS WAS BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE MANY COUNTRIES IMPORT TO THE UNITED STATES WILL EXPERIENCE WATER PROBLEMS WERE JUST POOR WATER QUALITY OR FLOODS THAT WILL RISK INSTABILITY AND STATE FAILURE INCREASED REGIONAL TENSIONS. AND DISTRACT THEM FROM WORKING WITH UNITED IT'S ON AND IT WAS POLICY OBJECTIVES. THE PORT THE REPORT ALSO STATED THAT DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS THE DEPLETION OF GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES IN SOME. AREAS GOING TO POUR WATER MANAGEMENT WILL POSE A RISK TO BOTH NATIONAL GLOBAL FOOD MARKETS. THAT WATER ENSURE BASINS WILL INCREASINGLY BE USED AS LEVERAGE AND THE USE OF WATER AS A WEAPON OR TWO FOR THE TERRORIST. UP PROJECT OBJECTIVES WILL ALSO BECOME MORE LIKELY. I'VE BEEN WORKING TO FIND YOU STRATEGIES AND WAYS TO COLLABORATE TO HELP ADDRESS THE DROUGHT WE ARE FACING A PROTECT US FROM WATER AND FOOD SCARCITY. NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. AND I EIGHT I. LAST YEAR THE SENATE MADE- AND PUSH NAVIGATOR FOR UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENTS IN OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSTRUCTION HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO RIP TO REPAIR THE STATE'S WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS THIS IS THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE TO CONSERVE THE LIMITED WATER SUPPLY THAT WE HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUDGET THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT MORE FUNDING IS STILL NEEDED FOR REPAIRS BUT UNTIL FULL REPAIRS ARE MADE WE WILL CONTINUE LOSE WEIGHT TOO MUCH PRECIOUS WATER AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- IT'S WATER THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE IN IN THIS CLIMATE. AND JUST LAST YEAR THERE WERE MANY TOWNS ACROSS MY SENATE DISTRICT. THAT OTHER WELLS RAN DRY AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE KNOW THE SIX MILLION PEOPLE FROM PARTS OF LOS ANGELES AND TORRANCE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES THAT RELY HEAVILY ON THE- ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT COULD EXPERIENCE THE SAME. SO THE IMPACT THE POOR WATER MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA THREATEN THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF ALL PEOPLE. AND TO COMBAT THAT SENATOR CORTEZ NINE PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF HOW DECISIONS FOR UNDERWATER MEAT. TODAY THERE ARE TOO MANY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AT EACH DEAL WITH A PIECE OF WATER MANAGEMENT WITH SIMILAR BUT SOMETIMES CONFLICTING GOALS. AND THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE BOTH MOBILE OFTEN LOW INCOME AND OR AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS AG. ARE TOO OFTEN NOT PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS THE LAWS OF THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS DO NOT APPLY. TO THE CHALLENGES THE NEEDS OF THE CALIFORNIA WE LIVE IN TODAY. WE INTRODUCED SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETEEN ALSO KNOWN AS A STATE WATER RESILIENCY MODERNIZATION ACT TO PRIORITIZE THE PRESERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY OF WATER USAGE. AND ENSURE THE WATER IS PROTECTED FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS ABUSE. MODERNIZING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO MEANS INCREASING TRANSPARENCY. MODERNIZING MEANS THAT WE HAVE BETTER CONTROL OF WATER FEET INCREASES. SOME OF THOSE FEE INCREASES BEING FELT ACROSS EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO RISE MORE THAN LIKELY. MODERNIZE IT ALSO MEANS THAT WE DO BETTER PROVIDING CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR ALL THAT WE DON'T DELAYED BECAUSE PROJECTS THAT OUR- MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES DESPERATELY NEED. MODERNIZING MEANS WE HAVE A CYBER SECURITY ACROSS OUR WATER SYSTEM AND ACKNOWLEDGES THE NEW ERA OF CYBER WARFARE WE ARE IN TODAY. AND HOW IT COULD BE USED AGAINST US COLLEAGUES FOR WATER MANAGEMENT MAKES US ALL VULNERABLE AND REALLY I THINK IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THREATENS. OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR VERY OWN EXISTENCE. SB TWELVE NINETEEN WILL IMPROVE OUR WATER MANAGEMENT BY CREATING A COMMITTEE THAT WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR MORE INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. A MODERN SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP US ACCOUNT FOR EVERY DROP OF WATER AND FOLLOWS THE MOST RECENT SCIENCE. A MODERN SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP US ALL CONSERVE. I'D LIKE TO GIVE TIME NOW A TO CENTER COURT TO THE TO SPEAK ON THE MATTER AS WELL THANK YOU. THE FIGURES SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL BE BRIEF- F. AFTER THAT- THOROUGH PRESENTATION- BY OUR COLLEAGUE- CENTER TARO- I THINK WHAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL IS A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE- PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS. IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE JUST ANOTHER ENUMERATED. BULLET POINT IF YOU WILL. ABOUT VARIOUS FINDINGS THAT SHOULD BE MADE DURING THIS PROCESS THAT'S CALLED OUT IN THE BILL- BUT- THAT STATEMENT IS REALLY ALMOST MORE OF A CONCLUSION. TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS A MODERN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SAID WATER WAS REGULATIONS. AND STATE LOCAL WATER AGENCIES. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE TAKE A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF HOW WATER RESOURCES IN THE STATE ARE MANAGED IN I'D IN IDENTIFY NECESSARY REFORMS. THAT'S NECESSARY REFORMS FOR A WATER SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO SERVE. EVERYBODY EVERY STAKEHOLDER- IN EVERY ISSUE OUT THERE IS THAT THE BISHOPS. IN A COMPREHENSIVE YES BUT TO DO THAT- THE BILL CALLS FOR A MAIN COMMITTEE- WHICH WOULD BE SET UP. IT IT THE SET UP ITSELF WOULD BE IN A VERY TRANSPARENT WAY. UP OKAY. IN A BLUE RIBBON TO- OF STAKEHOLDERS TRANSPARENT AS THEY WOULD LIKE- AND SO I DON'T WANT TO- HIS. KHALKHAL WITH OPPOSITION. WITH THAT DONE BEFORE IT'S IT STATED OR- OR OR- BUT PERHAPS- IT OVER ANTICIPATED- BUT- YOU KNOW TO LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD AT LEAST IN THE ANALYSIS- THAT- THAT SOMEHOW THIS KIND OF WORK COULD BE DONE. IMPLIED NOT AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE IS NOT REALISTIC OF COURSE IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THANK YOU. VERY HEALTHY JUST WALDRON APOLOGIZE- THE PROCESS IS NECESSARY WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE A MODERNIZED WATER SYSTEM WOULD WANT MODERNIZE WAY TO LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WATER SYSTEM AT ANY MOMENT NOTHING EVEN EQUIPMENT THE ICE SO THAT WOULD APPLY TO WATER RIGHT NOW. WE NEED IT IT OF COURSE S. B. THE PROCESS OR ANALYSIS TO BE PAID FOR TAXPAYERS EXPENSE- TRANSPARENCY IS NOT ONLY NOT A PROBLEM OR OBSTRUCTIONISM OR ANYONE TRYING TO IMPEDE- THE REFORMS BUT THE OF ACTUALLY CALLS FOR ARMS INTO THE PROCESS WHERE THERE WOULD BE LEGISLATORS FROM HOUSES WILL. KARAMANA WROTE ROUGHLY A TO WHAT WE HAVE- IN A POST COMMITTEE- LIKE WE'RE CONVENIENT HERE TODAY SO- YOU KNOW I'M VERY PROUD- YOU KNOW TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND- AND WOULD URGE- I POKE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I'M A MODERATOR I BY DO WE HAVE THE TEST OF THE- WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- FRANK GALLERIES. I DON'T SEE HIS WIFE CONNECTED IF HE IS DIALED IN AS A PARTICIPANT MAKING HIM WONDER VERO OKAY YOUR IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HE'S HE'S NOT GOING AUTHORITIES SO IT IT WHO WANTS OF ONE HERE IN PERSON WITH THE VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL WILL GO TO MODERATE IF YOU COULD SWITCH TO THE OPEN PHONE LINES. IF ANYONE WANTS TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL SB TWELVE NINETEEN. I WOULD LIKE THIS OUR VOICES SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THAT ZERO. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. WE DO HAVE ONE KID UP HERE FOR THE. AND THE FIRST ONE IS FIVE TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'M I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED AM I ALLOWED TO I'M EXPRESSED OPPOSITIONAT THIS POINT OR DO I NEED TO WAIT WHAT WE'RE HAPPY TO KNOW DRIVERS IF YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR QUESTION. ANDREAS VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION- I'M CALLING FROM SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA I'VE WORKED WITH THE WATER BOARD FOR MANY MANY YEARS- AND CLEAN WATER ACTION ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- REGRETFULLY OPPOSES THIS BILL WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER COMMITTEE I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY. IF ANYONE ELSE ABOUT SPEAK AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO. AND THERE ARE NO FOR THE WHY DID YOU AT THIS TIME CORRECT OKAY ARE AT LATIMES FOLKS YOU WANT TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- WE DON'T HAVE A LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WE JUST. HEARD FROM ONE. PERSON BY ANYONE IN PERSON- YES HERE WE ARE OKAY. A GOOD AFTERNOON KYLE JONES WITH COMMUNITY WATER CENTER IN OPPOSITION- WE DO THINK THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY PROCESS LIKE ME BETTER HANDLED BY. EXISTING OVERSIGHT PROCESSES THROUGH THE BUDGET IN ORDER TO FIND THE REFORMS THAT WE NEED- AND WE DO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FEES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ON WATER USERS ACROSS THE SECTOR I THINK THAT WAS A RESULT OF A SHIFT OVER A DECADE AGO. TO SHIFT THE WATER POURED FROM A GENERAL FUND BASED. TO A FEE BASED STRUCTURE AND MAYBE THERE'S TIME TO REVISIT THAT TO SUPPORT BETTER SUPPORT. THE WORK THAT THE WATER BOARD DOES THAT IS CRITICAL FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS THE APPROACH. TO DO IT. WE ARE TRAVEL THANK YOU. OKAY FIGURE OUT HOW BECAUSE I AM YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OKAY- LET'S GO TO THE FUNDS ANYONE WHO WANTS TO VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. PLEASE PRESS ONE AT THIS TIME. I'M SORRY ONE FOLLOWING ZERO DEFECT. AND LIMÓN PLEASE WITH A BLANKET OF. AND THAT FLIGHT NUMBER IS. WE HAVE FIVE TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON ELENA ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF NASCO RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ACTION FUND IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND THERE ARE NO FOR THE WIND TO GIVE. OKAY ALL RIGHT TO THE SITE IS BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE- I LOOK I YOU KNOW IT'S- CLEAR TO ME THAT WE DO NEED A REAL RE EXAMINATION OF OUR WATER SYSTEM AND I GUESS I'M A PART OF I WANTED TO USE TO CRANK OUT BECAUSE- I READ THE- OPPOSITION LETTER. AND I KNOW THIS BILL IS THE PRODUCT OF A GRAND NEGOTIATION WHEN ABOVE AND LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE- I GUESS INTERESTING MODELS OUT THERE I YEAH I WITH YEARS AGO DURING THE LAST MAJOR DROUGHT WITH A NUMBER OF US TOOK ACV TRIP TO AUSTRALIA AND LEARN ABOUT THEIR SYSTEM THERE WHICH IS JUST FASCINATING BY THE WAY- YEAH THEY HAVE SIMILAR. WATER RIGHTS- STATED SIMILAR- COMMON LAW RIGHT HERE IN RIGHTS TO WHAT WE HAVE. SIMILAR OF COURSE COMING FROM THE U. K. RIGHT WHICH IS NO END OF RAIN AS OF THE NO NO WATER PROBLEMS THEY'RE HIDING COURSES SIMILAR CLIMATE TO ALL WE HAVE HEREWHERE WHERE WHERE FOR FOLKS ARE ARE WE WERE WE HAD REAL PROBLEMS WITH WATER ACCESS. AND THEY THEY BASICALLY TOLD ME AFTER SYSTEMS THEY HAVE A COMMODITIES MARKET FOR WATER YOU CAN GO ONLINE RIGHT NOW AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT ALL THE WATER LEVELS ARE IN EVERY RESERVOIR RIVER IN SOUTHEAST AUSTRALIA WHICH IS WHERE EVERYBODY LIVES. THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT IS ALLOCATED PER PERSON AND THE REST THE WATER IS A MARKET SO THAT WHEN. WATER MOTOR MARKET DEMAND IS MORE WATER WHAT IS LESS EXPENSIVE AND IT REALLY DOESN'T SET OF EYES. YOU TO CONSERVE- NOT JUST. THEY BEING TOLD TO BECAUSE THERE'S A MY- MECHANISM TO PUSHING THEM IN THAT DIRECTION. AND IT IS EQUITABLE IN THE SENSE THAT IT RECOGNIZES THE FACT THAT EVERY BUT THERE'S ONLY CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER AVAILABLE. AND YEAH WITH THE YEAH. PEOPLE CAN PAY THE COSTS ARE NOT- WELL YOU KNOW ONCE THE ONCE THERE'S WHAT ONCE THEY GET THEIR OWN PERSONAL ALLOCATION THERE WOULD BE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY. IS INDIVIDUALLY TAKEN CARE OF FOR THEIR PERSONAL NEEDS. I'M SO HAPPY FOR MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S GREAT TO TAKE A STEP BACK TAKE A BIG LOOK AT WATER RIGHTS. AND I GUESS WHAT I GUESS WHAT I'M- I YOU KNOW I GET. IT IN THE LETTER IT TALKED ABOUT AYE AYE ANDERSON IS MISTRUST REMINISCE SPECIALLY WITH THE- MEASURE THE VETO OF S. B. Y. AND I. YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THAT I RECOGNIZE THE- YOU KNOW IT MAY MAYBE THE FACT THAT- THAT THE DAY WOULD WANT. A MORE EXPLICIT DIRECTION FROM THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS REFORM OF THE YOU KNOW THE WATERING SYSTEM AND ALL THE INEQUALITIES THERE. ALSO ARE A CERTAINLY EITHER A COUPLE THINGS THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO TINKER WITH WITH THE WORDING OF THE BILL BUT I GUESS. I DON'T SEE WHY. THIS APPROACH IS NECESSARILY. GONNA BE ANTITHETICAL TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IN WHITE- IN IN IN A WAY WHY WHY WHY DO WHY WHY WHY WOULD YOU ARE YOU ON A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THE GOALS OF THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE MET THROUGH A BILL. LIKE THIS IF WE CAN. FIGURE OUT THE APPROACH- AND ENGAGE. YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES IN A WAY THAT TO ENSURE THAT THAT THE CONCERNS ARE BEING INCORPORATED. YEAH I THOUGHT SO I AGREE ENGLISH COMMON LAWS BERMAN PRETTY TERRIBLE FOR IN STATE MANAGEMENT AND I THINK AS A GUISE OF THE ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE THERE PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO NEED TO BE SOME SORT OF CHANGE ON HOW WE ALLOCATE WATER RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA. PERSONALLY I THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE DRINKING WATER RIGHTS COME BEFORE ANY OTHER CONSENTED RIGHT WHICH IS A STERLING APPROACH IT- FANTASTIC APPROACH- WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT JUST THE APPROACH BEING IN THIS MODEL I THINK IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO WHO WHO IS WHO IS DEFINING WHAT. IT MEANS MODERNIZE MEANS AND- WE ARE WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT- MAKING SURE THAT THE GOALS AT THE OUTSET OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE REALLY ARE THEY GONNA BE FOCUSED WITH MAKING SURE THAT THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL THIS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BENEFITS OR MATT. IS THERE GOING TO BE A PUSH TOWARDS TOWARDS OTHER THINGS THAT MAYBE THE COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED ABOUT AND I JUST- SEEING WHERE THE BILL ORIGINATED BECAUSE CONCERT WITH US SO WE ARE AND HOW HOW IT ORIGINALLY LOOKED AT W. APPRECIATE AND SO NATURI AND WATER- WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT THE- LEVEL OF CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE PORT ITSELF IS REGULATING- WHERE IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WE WORK TO PUT THE SECOND PART BILL. THANK REPORTABLE DRINKING WATER FUND THERE- SO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BOARD IS PRESERVED AND WE GOT THAT. ORIGINAL PROPOSALS. OFF THE TABLE. YEAH YEAH BUT FOR MY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SETTING UP A PROCESS THAT THAT THAT IS THAT IS THE- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT MODERNIZATION MEANS. THAT THAT COMES FROM OF FROM THAT PLACE THAT THIS COMES WROTE FROM WHAT NEEDS TO BE MODERNISED GETTING RID OF THE WORD OKAY WILL MAYBE WE'RE NOT GETTING RID OF THE BOARD ANYMORE. BUT IT'S STILL COMING FROM THE SIDE OF THINGS THAT THE BOARD HAS BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT. THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND HOW THE HOW THE STATE'S GOING AND THAT WE NEED TO JUST MOVE EVERYTHING TO A DIFFERENT AGENCY OR OR TEAR DOWN WHAT'S ALREADY THERE- AND SO WE JUST HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROCESS AS WRITTEN. OUT I'M THAT IT'S WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS GOING TO BE DESIGNED IN A WAY TOWARDS. THAT WHAT'S FROM GETTING TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AIMS- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS THAT WE CAN TRUST WHEREAS- AND- WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THAN IS THAT GOING TO STALL NEEDED PERFORMS FROM HAPPENING IS THAT GOING TO YOU KNOW TAKE UP THE OXYGEN IN THE ROOM AND WHAT HAVE YOU. YEAH I GUESS I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS NOT LIKE THE STATUS QUO IS GREAT EITHER- AND SHE'S ASKING. WITH THE OTHERS ARE ASKING FOR IT FOR A REAL LOOK I MEAN USING THE ANSWERED IT FOR US TO JUST SIT DOWN AND TRY TO. WORK ON THE LANGUAGE. I MEAN IT WILL LET LET LET ME THIRTY YOU- SENATOR IT WHAT. IT OBVIOUSLY I THINK YOUR ORIGINAL PROPOSAL REALLY TOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE BACK I MEAN IT WAS OF. A SERIOUS BACKLASH AMONG YOUR COLLEAGUES. ABOUT THE IDEA JUST TO SPENDING THE WATER BOARD- I THOUGHT YOU KNOW COURSE NOW THIS IS A TOTALLY. DRAMATICALLY CHANGE BILL. YOU HAVE A HEARING. I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF KYLE'S ARTICULATED- I KNOW IF I WERE TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY WOULD BE DONE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT. THOSE SOME OF THOSE KEY CONCERNS ARE GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ANALYSIS THAT'S- BEING. HI THAT'S BEING BROUGHT TO BEAR THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR INTENT. WITH THIS BILL AS IT STANDS NOW LOOK I UNDERSTAND IT. FOR THE CONTROL. THE OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM RIGHT THAT WE ORIGINALLY WITH THIS BILL WE HAD TO. INCLUDE LANGUAGE TO GET RID OF THE WATER BOARD LOOK THE REAL LET'S BE REAL THE WATER BOARD IT'S- IT'S NOT THE MEMBERS IT'S JUST IT'S THE SYSTEM. RIGHT THAT IS JUST NOT WORKING AND THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED. AND IT'S HONESTLY A LITTLE. IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT- THE% OPPOSITION I MEAN THERE'S- THIS IS A BILL THAT- WE MADE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT WORK SO IT LOOKS AT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE RIGHT. WE TOOK A WHOLE APPROACH VERSUS JUST. FOCUSED ON ON ON THE WATER FORGE PEACE OR HAVING TO PUT IT AS WELL I THINK THIS IS MORE OF A PERSONAL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL RIGHT THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WE DO NEED REFORMS. NOW I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF WHAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD WHAT YOU KNOW PUT PROPOSED AND PUT IN FRONT OF US THIS IS. THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DOING THE WORK THAT ARE THE EXPERTS IN THE AREA THAT ARE THERE ARE COMING TOGETHER TO. PRESENT SOLUTIONS. TO LEGISLATORS AND SO- I DON'T HAVE ANY OUT I MEAN. PROBABLY IF APPOINTED. YET THERE ARE DIRECTLY SPEAKING I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF INFLUENCE IN FRONT. AT YOU KNOW OVER WHAT THE WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE FACTS. I MEAN THAT'S RIGHT IF LIKE- HEATER BUT I GET IT AND YOU CAN LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE NERVOUS GIVEN THE ORIGINAL BILL BUT BUT THAT BUT THAT IT'S A NEW BILL RIGHT I MEAN WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. I GET THAT THEY'RE NERVOUS BUT THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEMS ARE STILL THERE AND IT SURE DIDN'T TAKE IT PERSONAL RIGHT SURE YOU SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND I'M SURE THAT. KYLE COULD AGREE TO SOME MODEL THAT GOT RID OF THE WATER BOARD IN RETURN FOR SOMETHING THAT HAD REALLY STRONG SAFEGUARDS THAT HE WOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT I MEAN I'M SURE YOU DRAFT A OF AN ALTERNATIVE WATER BOARD PLAN THAT WOULD BE BAD. CURRENT THAT BEING YES SO. IN FACT THAT IS BECAUSE WHAT THE- WHAT. THE IN YEAH BUT IT MIGHT JUST IN A CONTINUE TODAY BE IT'S JUST BEEN VALIDATE WAS THAT THE ORIGINAL OPPOSITION LETTER PRIOR TO THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING SAID THE SOLUTION IS GONNA BE OUT. IN MUCH OF THE REST OF BILLS FINE ESSENTIALLY IN PARAPHRASING AND THIS IS THERE NEEDS TO BE A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW ALL RIGHT THEN WHAT I SO THAT'S ALL TO YOUR POINT. THAT WAS. FOR THOSE THOSE AMENDMENTS IN IN BEYOND WERE- WORK WERE ACCEPTED. THEY WERE HERE TODAY WITH THIS DRAMATICALLY REVAMPED BILL THREE DISSOLUTION IN IT. BUT WHAT WAS. SAID JUST A MINUTE AGO IT'S NOT A PARAPHRASE SOMEONE TRY TO QUIT EXACTLY IS OUR CONCERN IS WHERE THE BILL. CAME FROM. WHICH IS PERSONAL. I TAKE THAT PERSONALLY AS SOMEBODY WHO SPENT TWENTY YEARS PRESIDING OVER THE BAY ESTUARY PROJECT AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. THEY WERE RECEIVING A COMPLAINT FROM THE UPPER MIDDLE COMMUNITY JOINING UP WITH SOMEBODY. THE CERTAINLY REPRESENTS A DISTRICT WITH A LOT OF THAT CULTURAL INTEREST COMING FOR TOGETHER SAYING THERE NEEDS TO BE A TRUMP ON REVIEW. REGARDLESS IN ALLSTATE CORP FOLDERS IN THIS BILL HAVE BEEN- THIS BILL HAS BEEN OPENED UP WITH WHAT I CALL THE SECOND COMMITTEE STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE. BUT TO INVITE STAKEHOLDERS TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS IN A VERY FAST WAY THOSE. TO WHERE IT CAME FROM. BURKE FROM A PERSONAL. AND WHAT IT SAID IN THE PAST. THAT'S NOT SURE OKAY I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND BUT SURELY OR INTENT IS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS ANALYSIS STORY THEY'RE NOT TO GO OVER THERE IS IT WOULDN'T GO AWAY INCLUDING AMOUNT JUSTICE CONCERNS. ABSOLUTELY YEAH AND THEN AND THEN OKAY. AND IN IN IN IN SURELY I MEAN IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW- YOU KNOW. I WOULD THINK YOU'D ALSO BE INTERESTED AS YOU JUST MENTIONED LIKE IT'S IN IN AN INVESTIGATION OF THE WATER RIGHT SYSTEM. AND YOU HAVE NOT WITHOUT WITHOUT KIND OF CREATING ANY OUTCOME SUGGESTED THAT THAT OUGHT TO BE EXAMINED. THERE'S NO LIMITATIONS ON THAT THE BILL I THINK THE BILL DOES A GREAT JOB. OF SORT OF STATING THAT THE EXCUSE ME FORGET JUMPING THAT- THIRTY. THE BILL DOES A GREAT JOB. OF OPENING UP IS ESSENTIALLY- ALL OF THOSE AREAS BUT I THINK. THE STRUCTURE AS THE BILL CONTINUES TO BE VETTED. ADDING AFFIRMATIVELY DDING TOPICS OR SUBJECT MATTER LIKE. YOU'RE JUST PROBING INTO- TOOK TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT'S CLEAR WHEN OKAY COMMITTEE ON THE SICKLE COMMITTEE CONVENES BUT THEY DON'T THAT THEY DON'T MISINTERPRET THEIR MISSION OR DON'T NARROW THEIR MISSION. SO THAT SO THAT- SO THAT ALL ISSUES ARE LOOKED AT OKAY THAT'S THE IDEA. HI OKAY YOU DON'T WANT LIMITING LANGUAGE HERE. BUT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE AS BROAD AT THE END IS DEEP A LAUNDRY LIST IF YOU WILL OF. OF KNOWN ISSUES- IN IS PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE DOESN'T MEAN. AN AD. ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S ANY CONCERN THERE ANYTHING'S BEEN EXCLUDED OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AM I YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I WOULD I WOULD YOU KNOW. I WANT TO SEE- AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD. WHERE I'M COMING FROM AND I YOU KNOW I WORKED COMMITTEES TRADITIONALLY COME FROM AND SO WE WANT TO SEE- JUST TAKE A LOOK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THE LANGUAGE IS GRADED ON THOSE ISSUES. I'M I HEAR THAT THE CONCERNED WELL WELL WE DON'T WANT WE WANNA MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T DELAY. OTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION ON WATER RIGHTS AND WATER POLICIES. I GUESS MY PROBLEM IS I'M NOT SEEING A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THOSE AREAS- YOU KNOW GET GET WE GET GIVEN THE STATUS QUO AND I DON'T SEE WHY THIS. CAN'T BE A MECHANISM. WHAT WHAT WHY THIS WOULD NECESSARILY- DELAY IN FACT IF DELAY PROGRESS EFFECTIVE ANYTHING IF WE IF WE IF WE'RE ABLE TO. WEAR THIS RIGHT IT COULD ACTUALLY HELP TO ADVANCE. OUR COLLECTIVE. NEEDS IN IN THOSE AREAS- IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE BOTH GOOD FOR REGULAR CALIFORNIANS GOOD FOR ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S REALLY. THE REASON I WOULD HAVE. YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SO. I'M. YES I DID I DIDN'T ACTUALLY PUT A NINE RECOMMENDATION I'M I'M COMFORTABLE NOW WITH THIS CONVERSATION I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS KYLE- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IT YOU KNOW I HEAR YOU. I UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERNED ABOUT- THE FRAMING OF THE OPPOSITION IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE FOR ME IT'STHE RIGHT IN THEIR IN THEIR LETTER ARE THERE IS MISTRUST QUITE FRANKLY AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE ORIGINAL WORDING THE BILLTHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED SB ONE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN. THAT HAVE CREATED MISTRUST. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WECAN'T COME TOGETHER. TO CRAFT A GOOD SOLUTION HERE THAT REALLY WILL WILL WILL WILL. WILL WILL. PUSH US. TO ASK FUNDAMENTAL. TEN THOUSAND FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS THE SYSTEM THAT I THINK IT'S JUST. BECOME SO FLAWED. AND IS REALLY NOT SERVING OUR STATE CONSERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT CONSERVING REGULAR FOLKS. THIS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING I'M I'M I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND WOULD ASK OUR COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME- ANYWAY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS OR YEAH YEAH YES CENTER DOLLARS. SO THE OPPOSITION IS LISTED TODAY IS THAT FROM BEFORE OR NOW IT'S ACTUALLY POST AMENDMENT TO GET IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE TEN IT ACTUALLY SAYS AS AMENDED- THE EIGHTY CERTAINLY FOR ABOUT YOUR BLUE RIBBON HOUSES PAGE TEN IF IT IF YOU COULD SEE THEIR ARGUMENT IS RIGHT THERE ON PAGE TEN OF THE WAY THEY WERE VERY OPPOSE THE FIRST TIME AROUND- BUT THEY STILL CONTINUE HAVE CONCERNS AND I WOULD INVITE YOU TO READ PAGE TEN BECAUSE IT IT DOES A GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING THEM AND- THEY'RE VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH WHAT. KYLE WAS ARTICULATED. WELL I'M I'M LOOKING AT. THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION AND I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY OPPOSITION FROM. WATER RIGHT HOLDERS OR BOARD AGENCIES OR OR- I SEE IT MAINLY FROM. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS RIGHT YOU KNOW CLEAN WATER ACTION COMMUNITY WATER CENTER SO THE THIS LIST IS. OPPOSING THIS BILL AS AMENDED RIGHT TODAY. YES OKAY HOW DOES THE KIND OF PERSON I THINK. SO I AM THAT'S UNFORTUNATE- OKAY WELL THAT THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW WAS WAS WERE IRATE. YEAH THIS IS COMMITTEE WHO'S WHO'S GOING TO BE A POINTING. TO THE COMMITTEE AND- WE GET KINDA GIVE YOUR VISION OF WHAT WHAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LOOK LIKE. OF- GO AHEAD AND TAKE TURNS SO- YOU SEE A PAGE- THAT PARAGRAPH ONE OF THE TOP THE ANALYSIS SENATOR- REQUIREMENT. THAT THE SECTOR NATURAL. HIS SECTOR PROVIDE MORE PROTECTION CONVENE A COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENTS SMITH. TO THE GOVERNOR INTO THE LEGISLATURE STRATEGIC VISION. PROPOSED STATUES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MODERN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SAID A WATER LAWS AND REGULATIONS- IT GOES ON TO SAY REQUIRES THAT THE CONCERT THE COMMITTEE- CONSIST.% OF THE SECRETARIES FROM NATURAL RESOURCES UC ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AGENCY DEPARTMENT. OF CULTURE. IN THE PRESIDENT PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. TAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN KIND OF REFERRING TO THANK. LATER IN PARAGRAPH FOUR. IN ADDITION TO WHAT I JUST SAID REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR OR THE COMMITTEE OR THE COMMITTEE ITSELF TO APPOINT A BLUE RIBBON CITIZEN COMMISSION OR TASK FORCE IN ADDITION TO THAT IN ADDITION THE BLUE RIBBON CITIZEN COMMISSIONER TASK FORCE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND ANY OTHER GROUP THAT THE GOVERNOR OR THE COMMITTEE DEEMS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE TO ASSIST IN CARRYING OUT THESE PROVISIONS. SEEMS PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE BUT AGAIN I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR BOTH OF AUTHORS TO SEE IF THERE'S- IF THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING THERE- WE'D LIKE TO HEAR IT SPECIFICALLY RATHER THAN JUST AS GENERAL. DISTRUST WELL WHAT I'M AND I DIDN'T I WASN'T POINTED AT YOU NOW AND I KNOW THIS LOOK THIS IS- AS YOU CAN TELL I MEAN YOU YOU YOU CAME OUT WITH A- THE A VERY. BOLD STATEMENT. IN ORIGINALLY IN THIS INTENT OF THIS BILL AND TRUST ME NOT. ALL EVERY MEMBER THAT I'M ASSUMING IN THIS LEGISLATURE HEARD ABOUT IT BECAUSE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT ARE CALLING UP SAYING. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON DOWN THERE. TO START OUT WITH. AND SO- AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS HAS CYCLES AND WE'RE IN A WE'RE A REALLY TOUGH CYCLE RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S BEEN THAT THE CYCLES ARE GETTING THEY SEEM TO BE CYCLING QUICKER. WHETHER IT'S- TOO MUCH WATER AS WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR WE SEE. YOU KNOW AND MANAGEMENT THAT WATER IS. SOMETHING THAT WE THERE'S BEEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT IN COURTROOMS. ARGUED OVER WATER IN CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA STOP ANYTIME SOON- THE ONLY WAY IT STOPS IS WHEN WE CREATE ONE MORE WATER. AND THERE'S OPTIONS TO THAT WHICH WE DON'T TALK ABOUT VERY OFTEN AND MAYBE THIS COMMITTEE WOULD COME OUT WITH SOME- CONCERNS LIKE. THE SALINIZATION MORE STORAGE AND TIMING OF HOW WE DO THINGS WITH WATER THAT'S WHAT I THINK WOULD BE AWESOME IF WE ASK IF WE ACTUALLY CAME OUT WITH SOME SOLUTIONS WERE WITH BUT EVERY TIME THE SOLUTIONS ARE AFFORD. BY WHATEVER GROUP IS PUTTING THEM FOR THE CBS WASHED IN CALIFORNIA POLITICS SO. SO I WAS NERVOUS I WAS THE ONLY OFFICE BILL I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE OUTCOME. IS GOING TO BE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE SHEPHERD ALONG THE WAY. AND SO- BUT IF. OUR IS YOUR IS YOUR SENSE THAT THIS BILL WILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY AND IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS AFTER THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S ALL I DO I JUST THIS IS THIS IS A- THE WORLD IS IT MAKES RELEASED ME VERY NERVOUS YEAH- AND AS SOON AS AS SOMEBODY WHO- LOOK WE THERE'S NO DOUBT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING BUT IT'S IN THE DAY- I'VE SEEN NEIGHBORS AND COMMUNITIES COME APART. AND I KNOW YOU'RE WITNESSING IT BECAUSE YOUR NEIGHBOR YOUR YOUR OUT OF WATER. IN IN PORTER BILL YEAH I GET IT- BUT WE NEED WE NEED SOLUTIONS SO- WHAT'S THAT IS THAT MARK TWAIN LINE YEAH- WHAT WHISKIES MADE FOR DRINKING WATERS MADE FOR FIGHTING OVER WILL KNOW THAT. THERE'S ON OF WHISKEY. WELL I MEAN I YOU KNOW I THERE'S AN AREA THAT- IN IN MY IN MY NEW DISTRICTS IT'S CURRENTLY IN THE CENTER STARNES BUT I'M I'M I'M GETTING AND REDISTRICTING- THAT TIME IS. YOU KNOW DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN OFFER IT'S NOT AT THE WATER PROJECTS NOT GIVEN ANYMORE WATER AND THEY'RE JUST BESIDE THEMSELVES AND THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO- YES. THESE ARE BIG ISSUES. WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THIS SOMETHING IT'S GOING TO BE MEANINGFUL ASK BIG BIG QUESTIONS QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. AND SO ON. YEAH. YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT- THE PHILADELPHIA ANYTHING. I GUESS I'LL JUST JOIN THE NERVOUS NELLY SAPIR. IT'S. VERY PRODUCTIVE- PRESENTATION AND THE OPPOSITION- AND THAT MY COLLEAGUES TALKING IS A TRY THAT MELTED DOWN. AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE. VERY EFFECTIVE TODAY- THE AUTHORS HE SAID IT JUST SETS UP A COMMITTEE AND SETS UP A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WE'RE ALL NERVOUS ABOUT IT BUT AFTER IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING AND I JUST WALKED IN HERE AND I SAID WELL THEY GOT THESE WATER PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY WANT TO GET THE SECRETARY SAID REVOLVED IN CEMEX. THE LEGISLATURE SET UP SOME COMMITTEES I WOULD BE SURPRISED AT THE OPPOSITION WHO ARE MY FRIENDS AND WELL THEY WERE MY FRIENDS WE START THIS YEAR AND I DIED. THAT THIS WOULD BE OKAY SO HOW. I WAS GONNA. I WAS GOOD AT STAYING AT THE BE TRUTHFUL BUT I'LL MOVE ON MOVE IT. WE GOTTA. WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING- AT IT IT DOESN'T AND I'M DOING IT WITH THE CAVIAR AT THAT IT DOESN'T STOP STOP THE BUDGET. DOESN'T STOP ANY OF THESE COMMITTEES- ANY OTHER AUTHORS FROM ENTERING LEAD PROPOSING LEGISLATION OR FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT IMPROVE THESE ARE. THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE STATE IS- A FACING IN THE WORLD WATER. YES AND I. THE INTENT OF THE OF THE LEGISLATORS OF BOTH THE YOU IS TO NOT CHANGE THIS BILL LATER ON TO ADD ANYMORE- IT IS TO BASICALLY GET A STUDY IS THAT IT I MEAN I THINK. THIS BILL HAS A WAYS TO GO HAS TO GO THROUGH OUR HOUSE TO THE OTHER HOUSE. AND SO CAN YOU TELL ME THAT YOUR INTENT IS TO NOT TAKE ANY FURTHER- AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD. CHANGE LAW. THIS WOULD BE THIS WOULD BE BE A STUDY BILL. SCROOGE THANK YOU COMPARTE ASKING IF IT'S TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT LOOK LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION FOR EXAMPLE NO THIS IS THE BILL. FOUR OR MANY CHECK ME I KNOW YOU GOT TO GET IT THROUGH YOUR TRYING TO SHEPHERD THROUGH MY POINT IS THAT. I RARELY COOK I READY CO AUTHOR BILLS BECAUSE SOMETIMES A CHANGING OF BILLS THAT I HAVE TO OPPOSE AND SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS I'M TRYING TO GET TO A POINT WHERE I WANT TO HELP YOU GET YOUR BILL OUT OF YOUR DAY I THINK IT'S GOING TO GET OUT BUT I'M NOT SURE. BUT I ALSO WANT SOME SOME. I WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT IT'S- THE BILL'S NOT GONNA GET CHANGED AND- WHEN ASSEMBLY INTO SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T RECOGNIZE RIGHT HERE. YEAH AND- ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I ON OUR END I THINK THAT WE HAVE- A BILL THAT IS. THAT IS SOLID THAT LOOKS KIND OF ATWATER AS A WHOLE RIGHT WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF IT. THAT WILL PROVIDE US WITH YOUR THROAT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IS. DONE IN A WAY THAT IS TRANSPARENT AND WHATNOT RIGHT THAT- BUT I. AT THE SAME TIME I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT. YOU KNOW- AMENDMENTS WILL BE IMPOSED ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT TO YOU BUT I CAN. I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN AS A CO AUTHOR WE WILL KEEP YOU ENGAGED.
