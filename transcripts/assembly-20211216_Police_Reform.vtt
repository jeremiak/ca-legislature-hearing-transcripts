00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.786
OFTEN. ARBITRARY AND GROSSLY

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:05.589
UNFAIR- SO OFFICERS ROUTINELY

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:08.091
COMPLAINED THAT THE LIKELIHOOD

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:10.193

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.294
LITTLE TO DO WITH THE

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.963
SERIOUSNESS OF THE ALLEGATIONS

AGAINST OFFICERS. BUT WAS

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:17.267
INSTEAD DRIVEN BY FAVORITISM

MEDIA PRESSURE AND OTHER FACTORS

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:21.371
THAT WERE OUTSIDE OFFICERS

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.540
CONTROL ON THE PERCEPTION WAS

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.475
THAT SOME OFFICERS ACTED OPERATE

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:27.177
WITH IMPUNITY BECAUSE THEY WORK

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.212
WELL LIKED BY THEIR SUPERIORS.

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:30.247

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.415
DISCIPLINE FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:35.018
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IGNORED.

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.086
OFFICERS ALSO EXPRESSED

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:37.654
TREATMENT OF THAT CONCERN ABOUT

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:38.822
THE TREATMENT AT DURING

DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS.

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:42.659
INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR THE USE

00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:44.194

THE SORTS OF CONCERNS BY HAVING

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:53.770
SOME DEGREE OF PROCEDURAL

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.505
FORMALITY TO THE DISCIPLINARY

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.974

HAD AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:03.480
PRESENT OUR DEFENSE. THERE IT'S

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:04.414
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:07.584
THE VERY REAL CONCERNS AT THAT

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.953
DROVE THE ENACTMENT PULL BAR.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.421

MOVEMENT IN THE NNETEEN SIXTIES

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:32.509
AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY THE

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:34.678
RISE OF CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS

00:53:34.744 --> 00:53:35.879
AND THE PUSH FOR GREATER

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.314

CIVILIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:46.523
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS WHICH

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.325
REALLY KIND OF BRINGS OUT THE

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:49.926
OTHER SIDE OF THE HISTORY OF A

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:52.629

00:53:56.866 --> 00:53:58.234
KIND OF STRONGER PROCEDURAL

WITH A FEW PROVISIONS THAT

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:20.824
POTENTIALLY MAKE IT HARDER TO

HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.095

DURING THE COURSE OF THE USE OF

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:12.221
FORCE INCIDENTS- AND OFTEN HERE

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.390
IN IN WHAT AS YOU GUYS KNOW HERE

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:18.728
IN LOS ANGELES- THERE IS A- THE

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:19.395
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT RESPOND. I

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.164
HAD SIGNIFICANT USES OF FORCE

THE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATOR IN THE

INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATOR

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.570
BUT ALSO. THE STATE ATTORNEY

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.438
GENERAL'S OFFICE OFFICE OF

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.073
INDEPENDENT REVIEW OR INSPECTOR

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.742
GENERAL'S SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:34.577
FOLKS TO COME OUT- AND GATHER

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.078
INFORMATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:39.715
THESE- THESE PARTICULAR CASES-

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.784
YOU KNOW. WITH THAT SAID I THINK

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:44.086
THAT- AS A PROFESSOR MENTIONED-

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.355
IF THE PANEL SHOULD DECIDE THAT

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:49.458
THEY WOULD LIKE TO. REPEAL THIS-

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.360
I THINK WE SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WE

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:52.461
SHOULD CAUTION OURSELVES

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:55.431
BECAUSE- BARGAINING AND- YOU

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.867
DON'T. A MORE USE- IN COLLECTIVE

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.969
BARGAINING CAN ACTUALLY LEAD TO

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:02.705
MUCH MORE FRUSTRATING- AND MORE

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.408
CHALLENGES TO A DEAL. FOR

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.076
SPENDING ESTIMATIONS- I THINK

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.844
THAT- YOU KNOW IF WE'RE TAKE A

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.880
LOOK AT. HOBART TAKE A LOOK AT

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:15.318
EACH SECTION- AND BE VERY VERY-

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.220
CAUTIOUS ON THE AND-

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:18.888
INTROSPECTIVE ON HOW WE'RE GOING

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:22.291
TO BE- REVISE IT- OR MAKE ANY

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.827
CHANGES TO THE PERSON'S. RIGHTS

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:27.496
BUT IN SHORT I BELIEVE THAT-

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:29.799
IT'S A- IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:32.034
PROTECTION- ON BOTH SIDES I

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.103
THINK IT HELPS IT HELPS-

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.339
DEPARTMENTS UNDERSTAND. HOW TO

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.441
ACT- PERFORM THEIR JOBS WITHIN

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:40.209
CERTAIN BOUNDARIES WITHOUT BEING

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:43.212
OFFICIOUS- AND- AT SOME POINT WE

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:44.413
PROBABLY WILL TALK ABOUT LIFE

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.948
PARTNERS. WHO IS ACTUALLY THE

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:47.216

ENABLE MINISTRIES- I'M SORRY ANY

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.427
COMPEL STATEMENT STATEMENTS

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.730
CANNOT BE USED CRIMINALLY. SO WE

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:01.764
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BY

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.032

INVESTIGATION THAT COULD LEAD TO

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.809
DISAPPOINT. THE COURTS AND CURB

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.378
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EXTENDED

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:25.247
THOSE SAME WEINGARTEN RIGHTS TO

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:28.350
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA-

IN INVESTIGATION OR SIMPLY NOT

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:01.116
TRUE THE OFFICER DOES NOT HAVE

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:03.052
AN ABILITY TO DO THAT THE COURTS

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:04.920
HAVE SAID. THAT THE OFFICER CAN

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:06.088
BE GIVEN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:08.891

EMPLOYER. CONTROLS IN PLACE

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.730
DIFFERENT THAN A CIVIL CASE

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.398
BECAUSE IT YOUR EMPLOYEES SO YOU

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.200

DONE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OR

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:29.578
WITHIN DAYS OF THE ACCUSATIONS

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.647
COMING FORWARD. THE FIREFIGHTERS

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:32.848
HAVE A BILL OF RIGHTS IT'S

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.616
ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL IN THIS

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:37.352
REGARD THE WINE GARDEN RIGHT

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:40.656
IT'S BROADER. BECAUSE THE OUR

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.591
BILL OF RIGHTS PERTAINS TO WIN

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.059
THE EMPLOYER THINKS THE

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:44.593
QUESTIONING COULD LEAD TO

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.296
DISCIPLINE. THE WEINGARTEN RIGHT

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:49.098
IS WHEN THE EMPLOYEE THINKS IT

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.032
COULD LEAD TO DISCIPLINE WHICH

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:52.067
IS ACTUALLY UNDER THE LABOR LAWS

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.736
EMPLOYEE CAN STE SAY I WANT TO

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:56.071
REPRESENTATIVES- IN ALMOST ANY

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.639
CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN PROBE HAS

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:58.841
TAKEN IT EVEN FURTHER AND

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.576
THEY'VE EXPRESSLY HELD THAT THE

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.478
RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA AS IN MY

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:04.046
OPINION THEY SHOULD BE. OUR

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.448
BROADER AND MORE EXPANSIVE THAN

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:07.983
THAT THE FEDERAL MINIMUM

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.985

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:33.368
ABOUT. WINE GARDEN. AND THE

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:34.870
NINTH CIRCUIT HAVE ACTUALLY GONE

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.471
EVEN FURTHER THAN JUST NATURE OF

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:38.040
THE ALLEGATIONS AND THEY SAID

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:40.209
THAT AS- UNION REPRESENTATIVE

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:41.310
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SECURE

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:42.477
INFORMATION REGARDING THE

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.646
SUBJECT MATTER- AND A PRE

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:45.814
INTERVIEW CONFERENCE WITH THE

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:47.616
UNION REPRESENTATIVES. IT'S NOT

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.184
MUCH DIFFERENT BUT THEY MAKE

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.887
CLEAR THAT IT'S ENOUGH. SO THAT.

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:54.289
THE ACCUSED EMPLOYEE CAN TALK TO

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.691
THEIR UNION REPRESENTATIVES AND

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:56.892
I KNOW WHAT THE SUBJECT MATTER

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.527
IS GOING TO BE. AND THEY CAN

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.896
PREPARE. THERE IS A CASE DOWN

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.631
THERE AT THE BOTTOM. ALLEN'S

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.767
VERSUS SIERRA MADRE AND IN THIS

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:08.470
CASE THE COURT WAS. LOOKING AT

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:11.106
THE RIGHTS UNDER P. O. B. R. AND

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:11.740
THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.976
PARALLEL. TO SPECIFICALLY THAT

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.944
PACIFIC TELEPHONE CASE AND TWO

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:18.580
OTHER. UNION RIGHTS IMPORTANTLY

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:21.116
IN THAT CASE. I THEY THEY

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.684
OFFICER AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.086
COMPLAINED THAT THEY WERE GIVEN

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:25.487
ENOUGH ADVANCE NOTICE AND THE

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.689
COURT SAID IT WAS SUFFICIENT.

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.758
UNDER THE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT.

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:31.260
WILL NAY OFFICER AND HIS

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:32.661
REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED THAT THEY

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:35.097
WERE GIVEN TIME TO TALK AND THEN

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:36.598
GIVE THE STATEMENT THAT SAME DAY

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:37.866
I THINK IT REALLY DRIVES HOME

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.368
THE POINT. THAT THE BILL OF

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:41.169
RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.672
DELAY OR IMPEDE THE ABILITY TO

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:46.408
CONDUCT A FAIR AND THOROUGH

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.244
INVESTIGATION- I CHIEF RAMBO HAD

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:50.646
MENTIONED THE RIGHT AGAINST SELF

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.080
INCRIMINATION AND I WANT TO JUST

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.283
TOUCH ON THIS TOO AND REMIND

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.784
EVERYBODY THIS IS A

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.853
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THERE'S A

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.954
BALANCE BETWEEN A FIFTH

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.122
AMENDMENT RIGHT AGAINST SELF

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.257
INCRIMINATION AND THE IMPORTANT

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.793
PUBLIC INTEREST IN KNOWING WHAT

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.262
ITS OFFICERS ARE DOING OFFICERS

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.697
ARE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.198
THAN OTHER EMPLOYEES THERE

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.967
SUBJECT EIGHT THIRTY TO AT SAC

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:13.468
OF THE PENAL CODE WHICH MANDATES

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.404
A PROCEDURE FOR RECEIVING

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:17.039
COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATING

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.507
COMPLAINTS AND EVEN INTERNAL

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:20.309
COMPLAINTS. AND MY CLIENTS

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:22.878
UNDERSTAND THAT PARTICULARLY IN

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:26.248
THESE TIMES THESE ARE IMPORTANT

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.383
. PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.352
CONFIDENCE- BUT YOU HAVE TO

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.820
BALANCE THE RIGHT AGAINST SELF

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.455
INCRIMINATION AND THIS IS ONLY

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.890
IN THE DISCIPLINARY SPEAR

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.258
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:37.225
NORMAL CRIMINAL DEFENDANT THEY

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.226
WOULD JUST INVOKE THE RIGHT TO

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:40.495
REMAIN SILENT AND SAY. NOTHING

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:42.731
AND SO THAT BALANCES LIVE ORDER

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.333
WHERE THE OFFICER IS COMPELLED

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.234
TO GIVE A STATEMENT. AND THAT

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.303
STATEMENT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.038
PURPOSES OF DISCIPLINE UP TO

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.440
TERMINATION THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:52.341
EXCEPTIONS WHERE THEY CAN

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:54.443
ACTUALLY STILL COME INTO COURT.

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.243
THE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE A MUCH

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:57.579
STRONGER PROTECTION THEY CAN

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.414
ONLY BE INTERROGATED REGARDING

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:00.182
MATTERS THAT HAVE CRIMINAL

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:02.250
CONNOTATION IF THERE'S A WRITTEN

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:04.386
GRANTED IMMUNITY. OTHER PUBLIC

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.422
EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES- ARE

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:09.558
ESSENTIALLY. SUBJECT TO THE SAME

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:10.892
Y. BARBARA RULED THERE WAS A

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.527
CASE CALLED SPIEL BAUER THAT

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:14.296
CLARIFIED THAT THAT YOU DON'T

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:15.297
HAVE TO BE THE PROSECUTING

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:16.598
AGENCY OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:17.899
AGENCY IN ORDER TO COMPILE AN

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.534
EMPLOYEE TO GIVE A STATEMENT.

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:21.003
EVEN IF IT INVOLVES POTENTIAL

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.571
CRIMINAL MATTER SO THE POINT

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:25.007
HERE IS THAT OFFICERS CAN'T JUST

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:25.907
INVOKE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.542
SILENT AND REFUSED TO GIVE A

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.244
STATEMENT REGARDING ALLEGATIONS

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.279
OF EXCESSIVE FORCE OR SEXUAL

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:33.615
ASSAULT OR ANY OF THOSE. SERIOUS

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:36.585
MATTERS. WHEN WE TURN TO THE

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:39.654
DISCIPLINARY APPEAL. HEARING THE

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:41.757
BILL OF RIGHTS DOES VERY LITTLE

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:44.459
ACTUALLY THE RIGHT TO APPEAL

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.727
DISCIPLINE FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:47.262
IN CALIFORNIA GOES ALL THE WAY

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.764
BACK TO THE SKELLY DECISION AND

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.565
IT'S A MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:52.401
RIGHTS. EMPLOYEES HAVE A FIFTH

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.403
AMENDMENT RIGHT THIS PUBLIC

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:55.003
EMPLOYEES I SHOULD SAY HAVE A

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.705
FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT. TO THEIR

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.340
CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AND THEY

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.808
HAVE A FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.309
PROCESS RIGHT BEFORE THAT CAN BE

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:03.578
DEPRIVED. AND SO I THINK

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:05.647
EVERYBODY REMEMBERS STALEY IT

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.783
HAS TWO PARTS GIVE A QUICK

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:09.751
REFRESHER ON IT THE FIRST IS PRE

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:11.153
DEPRIVATION MEANING BEFORE THE

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.988
DISCIPLINE IS IMPOSED. THE

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:14.756
EMPLOYEE HAS A RIGHT TO A COPY

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.558
OF THE INVESTIGATION AND TO

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.660
RESPOND NOT IN THAT EVIDENCE

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:21.096
REYES BUT JUST TO MEET AND

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:22.464
RESPOND AND EXPLAIN. IF THEY

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.099
DISCIPLINE IS IMPOSED THEY HAVE

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:26.101
A RIGHT TO HAVE THE DENTURES

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:28.070
HEARING APPEALING THAT. THESE

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:30.639
RIGHTS ARE NOT IN P. O. B. R.

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:34.309
AND THEY ARE. EXISTING

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.378
REGARDLESS OF P. O. B. R. ALL

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:39.247
THAT THE BILL OF RIGHTS SAYS IS

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:40.949
THAT NO PUNITIVE ACTION CAN BE

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:42.451
IMPOSED WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:44.152
FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:45.153
JUST A RESTATEMENT OF THE

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.189
EXISTING LAW. IT GOES ON TO SAY

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:48.423
THAT THE LOCAL AGENCIES SHALL

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:50.092
SET THE RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:51.760
APPEAL THAT'S YOUR CIVIL SERVICE

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.762
SYSTEM THAT ALSO EXISTS IN THIS

01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:55.664
IS JUST A RESTATEMENT OF THE

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:58.567
EXISTING LAW. THE BILL OF RIGHTS

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:00.202
PROVIDES A RIGHT OF ACCESS TO

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.937
ADVERSE COMMENTS AND TO

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.905
PERSONNEL FILES THAT CAN BE USED

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:05.941
TO DISCIPLINE EXPRESSLY. THERE

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:09.411
ARE OTHER STATUTES THAT APPLY TO

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.113
NON SWORN EMPLOYEES IN

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.881
CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS A PRETTY

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:15.650
STANDARD RIGHT- YOU KNOW ASIDE

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:17.052
FROM ALL RIGHT TO WORK STATE.

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:18.520
THAT ANY EMPLOYEE WHETHER

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.222
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC IN CALIFORNIA

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:24.526
HAS. THE FIREFIGHTER BILL OF

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.027
RIGHTS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.029
WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT. IT

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:29.798
ACTUALLY SPECIFIES WHAT THE

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:31.933
APPEAL PROCEDURES ARE AND

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.268
THEY'RE MUCH MORE ROBUST IT

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.337
MANDATES EITHER OF THE

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.938
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT OR

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:39.274
BINDING ARBITRATION- WITH

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:41.543
RESPECT TO PEACE OFFICERS. IT

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.044
RUNS THE GAMUT I WOULD SAY THE

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.412
MAJORITY IS A CIVIL SERVICE

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:45.981
BOARD THAT'S VESTED WITH HEARING

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:48.049
THESE APPEALS THERE ARE CITIZENS

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:51.286
APPOINTED BY. ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.854
SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:53.622
ARBITRATION BUT THAT'S THE

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:56.458
MINORITY I SOME HAVE CITY

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.894
MANAGER OR CITY COUNCIL REVIEW

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.531
OF THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS- BUT

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:05.200
THERE IS- AS A PRIOR SPEAKER

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:09.304
MENTIONED. I A WIDE AVAILABILITY

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.039
FOR CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AND THAT

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:12.707
DOES IN FACT EXIST WITHIN THE

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:14.943
APPEAL PROCESS ITSELF AS WELL

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.179
AS- IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THEIR

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.014
CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS AND OTHER

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.982
MEASURES AND I SHOULD ALSO POINT

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:23.885
OUT. THAT AS PART OF THIS MOMENT

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:25.353
IN REFLECTING ON POLICE REFORM

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.923
MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.624
PARTICIPANTS WORKING WITH THE

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:31.092
STAKEHOLDERS AND WORKING WITH

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.161
THE LEADERSHIP TO ENACT

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:35.497
STATEWIDE USE OF FORCE STANDARDS

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:38.166
TO REFORM USE OF FORCE POLICIES

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:40.402
TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AND

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:43.672
ALSO ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR THE

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:46.007
CERTIFICATION OF OFFICERS WHO

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.943
COMMIT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WHILE

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.644
STILL AFFORDING THEM DUE PROCESS

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.013
RIGHTS- I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.315
THE STATUE LIMITATIONS I

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.750
UNDERSTAND- FROM THE PRIOR

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:56.418
SPEAKER THAT THERE WAS SOME

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:58.086
CONCERN. ARE THERE SOME

01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:59.254
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:02.390
HERE THE STATUTE RUNS FROM THE

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:05.660
DISCOVERY OF A PERSON AUTHORIZED

01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:07.362
TO INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.997
JUMPING MY SLIDES HERE A LITTLE

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:10.832
BIT BUT THERE IS A THREE YEAR

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:12.234
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.969
GENERALLY APPLIES THE PUBLIC

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:16.404
EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:16.972
THREE YEAR STATUTE OF

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:20.842
LIMITATION- I THINK. IT'S RIGHT

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:23.912
HERE AB IT RUNS FROM THE DATE OF

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:28.450
OCCURRENCE SO IF NOBODY FINDS

TRAFFIC COLLISION THAT WOULD

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:01.950

IS A DEFENDANT AND BEYOND ALL OF

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.039
THAT. THERE'S AN ABILITY OF THE

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:59.441
AGENCY TO RE OPEN THE

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:02.377
INVESTIGATION. IF THERE'S- IF

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:03.978
THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE. THAT

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:06.047
FIREFIGHTER BILL OF RIGHTS HAS A

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:08.717
SIMILAR STATUTE THERE'S ALSO A

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.185
CIVILIAN STATUTES FOR CIVILIAN

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:12.887
POLICE EMPLOYEES IN THE MMDA-

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:14.923
THAT'S THE SAME AND THEN. YOU

ALSO HAVE EVEN SOME SHORTER TIME

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.728

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:25.367
AGREEMENTS. I WOULD SUBMIT. TO

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.469
THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS A

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:29.604
VERY STRONG PUBLIC INTEREST AND

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.006
MAINTAINING TIME LIMITATIONS ON

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:34.075
DISCIPLINE. THE ENTIRE POINT OF

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.877
DISCIPLINE IS TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:37.746
AND CORRECT BEHAVIOR SO YOU HAVE

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:40.014
TO PUT AN EMPLOYEE ON NOTICE

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:41.182
THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:43.718
DEFICIENT. AND THEN CORRECTED

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:45.186
NOW AGAIN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:47.355
SOMETHING LIKE A USE OF FORCE OR

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:49.357
AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:51.192
I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.761
IN THOSE CASES THE OFFICERS PUT

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.329
ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE AND-

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:56.631
INTERVIEWED WITHIN A WEEK OR SO

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.733
OF THAT HAPPENING NOW TO BE FAIR

01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.868
THE AGENCY'S GONNA WANT

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:00.769
INTERVIEW THE OTHER WITNESSES

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:02.637
FIRST. BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:03.471
THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE AN

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:05.373
OFFICER WORKING FOR A YEAR OR

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.841
MORE THAN A YEAR WITHOUT

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:08.676
CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION AND

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.812
IF THEY WERE SO INCLINED IT

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:11.346
WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC'S

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:12.914
INTEREST. TO PUT A TIME

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.682
LIMITATION ON THAT TO FORCE THEM

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:15.483
TO CONDUCT A TIMELY

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.985
INVESTIGATION AND IF THAT

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:17.986
OFFICER COMMITTED SERIOUS

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:19.888
MISCONDUCT REMOVE THEM FROM THE

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:22.524
FORCE IF THEY DIDN'T THEN CLARA

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:26.094
PUT HIM BACK TO WORK SO YOU'RE

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.862
OR JUST LEAVING IT HANGING OVER

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:29.497
THEIR HEADS WHERE THE TIME

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.633
LIMITATIONS. TYPICALLY WOULD

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.902
COME INTO PLAY IS ON MINOR

01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:36.671
ISSUES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE A

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.540
DETECTIVE WHO IS WRITING VERY

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:39.841
GOOD REPORTS ARE CONDUCTING

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.910
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS AND THE

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:43.244
PUBLIC INTEREST WOULD STRONGLY

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:45.280
IN MY VIEW BE IN FAVOR OF TIMELY

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:47.048
CORRECTING THAT. RATHER THAN

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.149
ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE TO

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:50.452
CONDUCT DEFICIENT INVESTIGATIONS

01:24:50.518 --> 01:24:51.619
FOR A YEAR BEFORE YOU TAKE

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.521
ACTION ARE MORE THAN A YEAR.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:56.157
BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION- IT DOES

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:57.725
NOT IMPEDE THE DISCIPLINARY

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.394
ACTIONS OR THE COMPLETION OF THE

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:01.062
INVESTIGATION AS I MENTIONED

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.864
AGENCIES PRIORITIZE THE MORE

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.966
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THEY CAN

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.234
ORDER AN OFFICER TO COME IN AND

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.136
PROVIDE A STATEMENT AT ANY TIME.

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.437
THE OFFICER CANNOT DELAY THAT

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.372
THE ON MAYBE A FEW DAYS AT MOST

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.140
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:14.209
REPRESENTATIVES AND MANY TIMES

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.144
IN MY PRACTICE. THE OFFICERS

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:17.679
BEEN ORDERED TO COME IN AND GIVE

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:19.514
A STATEMENT IMMEDIATELY ON

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:22.116
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT- ON CRITICAL

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.385
INCIDENTS ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.855
AND THEIR UNION FACILITATES

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:27.956
GETTING AN ATTORNEY YOU'RE

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:32.293
GETTING A REPRESENTATIVE. FOR

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.728
THEM. IMMEDIATELY AND I ALSO

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.430
WANT TO POINT OUT ANOTHER RISK

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:36.764
OF NOT HAVING A TIME LIMIT AND

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:37.866
THIS ONE MAY BE IT'S A LITTLE

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:39.534
CLOSE TO HOME I PERSONALLY

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.302
REPRESENTED AT MICHAEL'S ECKLER

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:42.871
WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:43.972
SACRAMENTO COUNTY LAW

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:46.307
ENFORCEMENT MANAGERS ASSOCIATION

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.910
THE TIME THAT I ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.378
COOPER WAS RUNNING FOR SHERIFF

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:52.380
BACK IN IRAN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:55.149
TEN OR SO AND MR ZIGLAR WAS

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.351
SUBJECT TO AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.652
INVESTIGATION FOR BRINGING

01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:59.821
DISREPUTE ON THAT SACRAMENTO

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:01.222
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BY FILING A

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.857
GRIEVANCE IN INVESTIGATING A

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:05.460
GRIEVANCE. AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.095
THE INTENT OF THAT WAS THE PLACE

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.163
HIM ON A GAG ORDER INDEFINITELY

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.798
AND WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO COURT

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:12.300
AND GET THAT LISTED AND HAVE HIS

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:15.069
NAME CLEARED BUT THERE IS A RISK

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:17.505
OF MISUSE AND ABUSE IF THERE'S

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:20.008
NOT A TIME LIMIT SO THAT THESE

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:22.076
ALLEGATIONS ARE RESOLVED- ONE

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:24.679
WAY OR THE OTHER AND JUST. IN

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.581
CLOSING. WANT TO KNOW TO THE

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:27.815
COMMITTEE THAT VIRTUALLY ALL

01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:29.317
STATES HAVE STATUTES

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:31.920
ESTABLISHING- SIMILAR TYPE

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.755
PROCEDURES FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:35.557
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS CALLED THE

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:36.591
BILL OF RIGHTS THIRD CONTAINED

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:39.494
IN. OTHER STATUTES AND CASE LAW

01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:43.197
AND OTHER NAMES ARE BUT THE THAT

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:44.399
. THE PROTECTIONS IN

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:46.501
CALIFORNIA'S BILL OF RIGHTS ARE

01:26:46.568 --> 01:26:48.169
AT THE LOWER END OF THE SCALE AS

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:49.537
THE PRIOR SPEAKER MENTIONED I

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.406
AGREE WITH THAT THEY ARE THEIR

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:53.374
BASIC UNION RIGHTS MORE THAN

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:57.045
ANYTHING ELSE. I THERE ARE

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:58.012
FOURTEEN OR ALL RIGHT I THINK

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.914
ACTUALLY THAT NUMBERS INCREASED

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:01.215
TO SEVENTEEN STATES THAT HAVE

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:03.618
EXPRESSED BILL OF RIGHTS I DO

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:05.820
WANT TO POINT OUT WITH ILLINOIS'

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:08.089
AND MARYLAND. THERE HAS BEEN

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.358
SOME MISS MISLEADING OR

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:12.627
CONFUSING REPORTING ON WHAT WAS

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.596
ACTUALLY DONE ON THAT SO CALLED

01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:16.130
REPEALING THE BILL OF RIGHTS

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:17.999
BOTH STATES STILL HAVE A BILL OF

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.968
RIGHTS FOR OFFICERS THERE WERE

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:22.537
AMENDMENTS STEIN. AND IF YOU IF

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:24.138
YOU DIG DEEPER AND LOOK AT WHAT

01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:25.607
WAS ACTUALLY DONE THEY WEREN'T

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:26.841
REALLY CHANGES TO THE BILL OF

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:29.777
RIGHTS THEY WERE AND ACTIONS-

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:32.313
REFORMS IN NATIONAL REFORMS VERY

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.381
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:37.285
CALIFORNIA. WITH RESPECT TO AB

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:37.852
THREE NINETY TWO WHICH I WAS

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.487

NINETY TWO AND- MSP AT FOURTEEN

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.061
NINETY TWO AND SIXTEEN WHICH

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:49.263
DEALT WITH TRANSPARENCY. SO

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:51.265
ILLINOIS' WHAT THEY DID IS THEY

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:53.635
ENACTED USE OF FORCE CHANGES

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:55.637
THEY ENACTED BODY CAMERA

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:57.739
MANDATES AND THEY STRENGTHENED

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:59.907
DE CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES ARE

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.476
SIMILAR TO WHAT. WE DID IN

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:04.612
CALIFORNIA WITH SB TWO MARYLAND

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:06.914
VERY SIMILAR THEY INCREASE CIVIL

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:08.716
AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY THEY

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:09.884
MANDATED DISCLOSURE OF

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.419
DISCIPLINARY RECORDS THEY

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:13.254
IMPLEMENTED STATE WIDE USE OF

DIRECTIVE. WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:53.367
LEAD WHAT WE COULD DO IS SET UP

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:56.170
AN NGO THAT WOULD GIVE THEM A

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:57.271
VOICE TO THE VOICELESS AND WE'LL

01:37:57.338 --> 01:38:02.476

LEGISLATURE TOOK ITS ACTION

01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:15.322

AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THERE ALL

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.002
KINDS OF REASONS. WHY LAW

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.770
ENFORCEMENT WILL LEGITIMATELY

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:32.172
DISENGAGE THEIR CAMERAS BUT IF

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:34.174

ORDINANCE PASSED YEAR THAT

01:38:35.676 --> 01:38:36.777
REQUIRE THEY BE URNED OVER

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:40.447
HUMONGOUS AND THAT CAME AS A

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:42.650
RESULT- SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:44.385
CAME FORWARD TO OUR OFFICE AND

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.186

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:48.055
WERE MISTREATED BY POLICE BUT

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.823
THERE WAS NO AUDIO OR VIDEO

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:52.092
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE SO THAT

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:53.661
THEN OF COURSE ON A STATE LEVEL

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:55.229
GOT LIFTED TO WHERE WE HAVE IT

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:58.165

THIS COUNTRY WHO SETTLED IN THIS

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:24.625
PART OF SACRAMENTO. AND ONE OF

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.627
THE THINGS THAT MAKES IT. IN MY

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:31.398
OPINION A VERY- IMPORTANT PART

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:33.400
OF OUR CITY IS THE DIVERSITY

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:35.969

INTERACT WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:44.945
JUST RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:46.046
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:47.214
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:48.916
DISTRACTION. IS THAT THEY FEEL

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.651
THEY HAVE NO RECOURSE IF THEY'VE

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:52.186

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:54.054
INAPPROPRIATE POLICE CONDUCT LET

IN SOME CASES OF. AN OFFICER

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:06.033
USING SOMETHING OTHER THAN

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:12.506
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:14.141
FOR THOSE ACTIONS I QUOTED MY

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:27.855
IN ONE SEGMENT WHAT HE DOES IS

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:30.491
EXPLORES THE CONCEPT THAT NOT

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:32.426
EVERY ASPECT OF POLICE

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:34.428
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR IS WITH

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:36.497
THE USE OF THAT DEADLY FORCE HE

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:38.232
TALKS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.333

I'M SURE THE OTHER RETURNING A

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:04.825
SIMPLE COULD ATTEST TO THIS WE

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:06.827
HAVE CERTAIN THRESHOLDS OF WHERE

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:09.496
WE CAN ACCEPT CASES IN OUR

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:11.231
INTAKE PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.699
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:14.501
SURE THEY'RE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:16.470
THAT THERE IS A LEGAL RIGHT FOR

WHATEVER IS THE CLAIM WRONG OF

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.340
THE PERSON WHO'S COME TO OUR

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:22.342
OFFICE AND QUITE HONESTLY THAT

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:24.378
THERE IS SUFFICIENTLY. A LEVEL

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:25.979
OF DAMAGES THAT COULD BE

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:28.315
AVAILABLE TO THE COMPLAINANT IF

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.416
IN FACT WE PROCEED WITH

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:31.585
LITIGATION LET'S TAKE LITIGATION

01:41:31.652 --> 01:41:32.886
OFF THE TABLE BUT WHAT ABOUT

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:34.354
THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT DON'T MEET

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:36.657
THAT THRESHOLD I'VE HAD NUMEROUS

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:38.025
CASES INCLUDING A WOMAN WHO CAME

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.526

WHO COULD CORROBORATE HER CLAIMS

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:53.207
BUT SHE MADE A VERY LEGITIMATE

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:55.609
SET OF CLAIMS IN MY OPINION THAT

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:57.311
THIS HAD IN FACT OCCURRED

01:41:57.377 --> 01:41:59.446
BECAUSE WE COULD NOT LOCATE ANY

UNABLE TO TAKE THAT CASE AS A

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:07.187
LITIGATION MATTER. BUT WHAT WE

FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THIRTY THREE

01:54:45.945 --> 01:54:49.616
OH FOUR. AND IN PRACTICE WHAT

01:54:49.682 --> 01:54:51.284
THAT MEANS IS IF AN OFFICER GETS

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:52.986
A WRITTEN REPRIMAND FOR

01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:55.021
VIOLATION OF POLICY WHICH- IN

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:56.656
ALL THESE AGENCIES THERE ARE

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.191
CONCEPTS OF WHAT ARE WHAT IS

01:54:58.258 --> 01:55:00.326
CALLED PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE-

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.394
YOU START WITH LOWER LEVEL

01:55:01.461 --> 01:55:03.630
DISCIPLINE UNLESS IT'S A VERY

01:55:03.696 --> 01:55:05.498
VERY SERIOUS ACT OF MISCONDUCT.

01:55:05.565 --> 01:55:09.202

WRITTEN REPRIMANDS THOSE CAN BE

01:55:12.939 --> 01:55:15.074
APPEALED SOMETIMES THOSE APPEAL

01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:17.043
HEARINGS CAN TAKE MULTIPLE

01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:19.579
BREAKS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT

01:55:19.646 --> 01:55:20.480
THERE'S A SOMEWHAT OF A

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:23.016
DISINCENTIVE FOR A SUPERVISOR TO

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:24.317
ISSUE A WRITTEN REPRIMAND TO

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:26.552
CORRECT BEHAVIOR- AND THAT'S

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:28.788
JUST A FACT OF LIFE IF YOU WILL-

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:32.425

OH FOUR ALSO HAS WHAT'S BEEN

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:37.630
TALKED ABOUT TODAY WHICH I THINK

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:39.032
IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.767
IMPORTANT PROVISION WHICH IS

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:41.934

MY VIEW- EIGHT. AS AN AREA THAT

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:50.576
I THINK IF THE COMMITTEE IS

01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:53.446

PROVISIONS IN THERE FOR

01:55:59.118 --> 01:56:02.055
TOTALING- I DON'T AGREE THAT

01:56:02.121 --> 01:56:04.857
IT'S AS EASY AS HE MAKES IT SEEM

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:06.726
TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION AND

01:56:06.793 --> 01:56:09.395
ONE YEAR IN ALL CASES ARE THERE

01:56:09.462 --> 01:56:12.465
CERTAINLY- SITUATIONS THAT I'VE

01:56:12.532 --> 01:56:14.701
HELPED OUR CLIENTS WITH WHERE IT

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:16.169
IS DIFFICULT TO GET WITNESSES

01:56:16.235 --> 01:56:18.171

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:20.340
WITNESSES WHOM AND MAYBE ARE

01:56:20.406 --> 01:56:21.908

UNAVAILABLE FOR ONE REASON OR

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:25.845

02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:20.165
ONE YEAR THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:21.333
CASE AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.235
DIFFERENT REASONS FOR AND THE

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:26.938
INABILITY TO DO THAT CAN BE CAN

02:12:27.005 --> 02:12:29.441
LEAD TO SOME DRACONIAN RESULTS-

02:12:29.508 --> 02:12:30.942
OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYEES DO NOT

02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:33.145
HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOTICE OF WHAT

02:12:33.211 --> 02:12:33.979
THEY'RE GOING TO BE INTERROGATED

02:12:34.046 --> 02:12:35.947
ABOUT- PRIOR TO THE

02:12:36.014 --> 02:12:38.016
INVESTIGATION. AT LEAST NOT THE

02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:39.951
EXTENT I BELIEVE UNDER AS THEY

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:41.787
AS OFFICERS TO UNDER POPE R. OR

02:12:41.853 --> 02:12:45.157
FIREFIGHTERS TO UNDER FOLLOW ARE

02:12:45.223 --> 02:12:46.591
- THERE'S NO RIGHT TO IN PRE

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:47.826
INTERROGATION DISCOVERY

02:12:47.893 --> 02:12:49.027
GENERALLY SPEAKING FOR OTHER

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:50.762
TYPES OF EMPLOYEES LIKE TERROR.

02:12:50.829 --> 02:12:53.665
THERE IS FOR OFFICERS THERE'S A

02:12:53.732 --> 02:12:56.968
CASE- SANTA ANA POLICE OFFICERS

02:12:57.035 --> 02:12:58.670
ASSOCIATION VERSUS CITY OF SANTA

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:01.540
ANA. I WHICH IS HELD AND NOT IF

02:13:01.606 --> 02:13:03.442
AN OFFICER IS IN. A SUBJECT

02:13:03.508 --> 02:13:06.778
OFFICER IS AND TARGETED TWICE.

02:13:06.845 --> 02:13:08.580
SO SAY THE- THE INVESTIGATOR

02:13:08.647 --> 02:13:11.049
NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICER

02:13:11.116 --> 02:13:12.484
ASKED SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS.

02:13:12.551 --> 02:13:14.820
OF THAT COURT AID THAT AND IT'S

02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:16.254
BEEN INTERPRETED THIS WAY BUT AT

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:18.490
LEAST BY THE UNION LETTERS THAT

02:13:18.557 --> 02:13:21.393
WE GET- THAT THE OFFICERS

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:22.794
ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING IN THE

02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:26.865
INVESTIGATORS POSSESSION- OTHER

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:28.200
WHAT OTHER WITNESSES HAVE SAID.

02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:30.535
TRANSCRIPTOME INTERVIEWS ALL THE

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:35.674
DOCUMENTS COLLECTED- ALL OF THAT

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:37.342
STUFF NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED TO

02:13:37.409 --> 02:13:39.411
THE SUBJECT OFFICER IF THERE IS

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:40.011
GOING TO BE A SECOND INTERVIEW

02:13:40.078 --> 02:13:44.683
OF THAT OFFICER. AND THAT IS IN

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:45.384
MANY WAYS NOT A SOUND

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:48.220
INVESTIGATORS- PROVIDING ALL

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:50.122
THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE SOME

02:13:50.188 --> 02:13:52.023
OFFICERS WILL TAKE THAT

02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:54.292
INFORMATION AND TAILOR THEIR

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.795
TESTIMONY ACCORDINGLY- I MENTION

02:13:56.862 --> 02:14:00.298
THIS- THE LEVEL. AT WHICH AN

02:14:00.365 --> 02:14:03.034
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL OF IS

02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:05.170
PERMITTED FOR A AN EMPLOYEE IS

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:07.305
LOWER FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND

02:14:07.372 --> 02:14:08.206
FOR FIREFIGHTERS THAN OTHER

02:14:08.273 --> 02:14:10.675
TYPES OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THEY

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:11.443
CAN APPEAL WRITTEN REPRIMANDS

02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:13.812
WHICH- IN MY VIEW IT SOMETIMES

02:14:13.879 --> 02:14:16.348
IS A IS A DISINCENTIVE TO ISSUE

02:14:16.415 --> 02:14:17.182
THAT LOWER LEVEL DISCIPLINE

02:14:17.249 --> 02:14:19.284
BECAUSE- IT CAN TRIGGER AN

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:21.019
EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING

02:14:21.086 --> 02:14:24.122
PROCESS- AND- THAT'S THE FIRST

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:24.956
PART OF THE PROGRESSIVE

02:14:25.023 --> 02:14:26.925
DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND SO. I

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:29.728
DON'T THINK- DISINCENTIVE ISING

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:32.798
THAT IS NECESSARY GREAT PUBLIC

02:14:32.864 --> 02:14:35.767

PANELISTS BUT FILING A CIVIL

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:52.470
LAWSUIT IS NOT THE PRIMARY

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:53.872
TRIGGER FOR INITIATING AN

CALL AND I THINK IT'S ALSO

02:22:10.054 --> 02:22:11.756
IMPORTANT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:22:11.823 --> 02:22:13.925

THIS ISN'T ABOUT HELPING.

02:22:23.234 --> 02:22:24.335
SOMEBODY GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:26.170
IF THE AGENCIES FOLLOW THE RULES

02:22:26.237 --> 02:22:28.506
ARE BASIC THINGS SUCH THAT YOU

02:22:28.573 --> 02:22:29.807

POLICING OUR COMMUNITY AND SO

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:33.631
THERE REALLY HAS TO BE SOME

02:24:33.698 --> 02:24:35.566
FOLLOW UP DIALOGUE NOT ONLY WITH

02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:38.903
EXAMPLE BUT ALSO WITH ALL THE

02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:40.705

02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:50.381
COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNS THAT.

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:51.949
REALLY WORKS WITH LAW

02:24:52.016 --> 02:24:53.317
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL TEND TO BE

02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:55.153
VERY VERY DEFENSIVE OF THEIR

02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:56.954
OFFICERS AND THEIR DEPUTIES.

02:24:57.021 --> 02:24:58.222
WHEN REALLY THERE SHOULD BE MORE

02:24:58.289 --> 02:25:00.858
DIALOGUE AND COMMUNICATION-

BACK TO THE COMPLAINANT IS

02:25:25.083 --> 02:25:27.819
LIMITED- BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:30.154
STATUTES- THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH

02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:31.556
THAT CAN BE SAID BECAUSE-

02:25:31.622 --> 02:25:34.459
OFFICER RECORDS DO YOU. HAVE A

02:25:34.525 --> 02:25:35.993
CONFIDENTIALITY ATTACHED TO THEM

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:38.062
BECAUSE OF THOSE STATUTES AND

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:39.497
SO. TO THE TO THE CHIEFS POINT

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:41.566
IT IS A RATHER SANITIZED VERSION

02:25:41.632 --> 02:25:43.301
WHICH CAN I THINK BEYOND

02:25:43.367 --> 02:25:45.503
SATISFYING IN SOME. TO SOME

02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:50.374
PEOPLE. A GREAT WAY TO GO TO- MR

02:25:50.441 --> 02:25:52.243
LACKEY. YEAH I THINK IT'S

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:53.511
IMPORTANT JUST. TO ONE ISSUE

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:54.512
THAT'S NOT GETTING ANY

02:25:54.579 --> 02:25:56.247
DISCUSSION OF A DISCOVERY PLEASE

02:25:56.314 --> 02:25:58.282
MENTION. OF AYE MR IS NEGATIVE

02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:01.586
IT. AS FALSE COMPLAINTS YOU

02:26:01.652 --> 02:26:04.655
GOTTA REMEMBER AS- AS A MEMBER

02:26:04.722 --> 02:26:06.924
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- COMPLAINTS

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:09.961
ARE SERIOUS THING WITH MY

02:26:10.027 --> 02:26:12.463
SERIOUS AND THEY ARE DOCUMENTED

02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:14.398
AND THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO

02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:16.701
NOTIFY. BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL

02:26:16.767 --> 02:26:18.669
AGENCIES AND I THINK IT IS. A

02:26:18.736 --> 02:26:20.671
VERY DELICATE TOPIC BUT THERE IS

02:26:20.738 --> 02:26:22.440
SUCH A THING AS- A FALSE

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:25.076
COMPLAINT. AND THERE ARE A

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:27.278
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE.

02:26:27.345 --> 02:26:28.546
WHO WANNA USE THE COMPLAINT

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:33.384
PROCESS AS RETRIBUTION OR AS- A

02:26:33.451 --> 02:26:35.786
TOOL TO PUNISH AN OFFICER

02:26:35.853 --> 02:26:37.455
UNFAIRLY BECAUSE THEY FELT LIKE

02:26:37.522 --> 02:26:39.290
OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT BROUGHT

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:41.459
THEM IN TO CUSTODY. WERE A

02:26:41.526 --> 02:26:42.960
DISTURBING. AND I THINK THAT

02:26:43.027 --> 02:26:47.865
THERE. THERE IS THE REALITY THAT

02:26:47.932 --> 02:26:49.767
NEEDS TO AT LEAST BE CONSIDERED

02:26:49.834 --> 02:26:52.603
THAT- YOU DO HAVE. A LARGE

02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:54.872
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. THEY

SOMETHING ABOUT SO. PARTLY IT

HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND I THINK

02:30:01.392 --> 02:30:07.565
I REALLY APPRECIATED WHAT- CHIEF

02:30:07.631 --> 02:30:09.066
ARAMBULA- TALKED ABOUT IN IN. EX

02:30:09.133 --> 02:30:10.668

02:30:10.735 --> 02:30:12.036
WHEN THIS FIRST PUT INTO LAW IN

02:30:16.874 --> 02:30:19.744
IT WAS. ENDORSED BY THE ACLU.

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:21.846

DON'T I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT BUT-

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:35.326
DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD MANDATE.

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:36.327
RIGHT MAYBE THERE' CERTAIN

02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:37.561
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IT

02:30:37.628 --> 02:30:39.163
LIKE EVERY OTHER THING SEACOR

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:40.531
EVERY OTHER MAJOR DOCKING WE

02:30:40.598 --> 02:30:41.565
HAVE HERE IS A LIVING BREATHING

02:30:41.632 --> 02:30:43.768
THING. TIMES HAVE CHANGED IT'S

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:47.138
BEEN UTILIZED DIFFERENTLY- BYE

02:30:47.204 --> 02:30:49.206
BYE WHETHER THEY'RE- INDIVIDUAL-

02:30:49.273 --> 02:30:50.474
JURISDICTION THROUGH THEIR

02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:52.443
CONTRACTS IN THEIR- THAT MIGHT

02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:53.744
USE WITH THEIR LOCAL LAW

ENFORCEMENT AGENCY- I DO

02:30:56.580 --> 02:30:59.450
UNDERSTAND THAT- I'D I'D I KNOW

WE DON'T HAVE. AS FAR AS ONE OF

02:31:02.186 --> 02:31:04.955
OUR PANELISTS HERE. THE ACLU-

02:31:05.022 --> 02:31:07.224
DID MENTIONED EARLY ON- SO I

02:31:07.291 --> 02:31:08.793
HAVE TWO ISSUES I WANT TO TALK

02:31:08.859 --> 02:31:11.295
ABOUT MISTER- ONE IS THE STATUE

02:31:11.362 --> 02:31:14.098
LIMITATIONS ISSUE. AND ONE IS

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:15.800
HOW THIS RELATES TO ALL OTHER

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:17.468
EMPLOYEES WHICH WAS WHICH WAS

02:31:17.535 --> 02:31:22.706
SUGGESTED. SO FIRST- I WE'VE

02:31:22.773 --> 02:31:24.842
HEARD DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THE

02:31:24.909 --> 02:31:26.977
ISSUE OF THE STATUTE OF

02:31:27.044 --> 02:31:31.115
LIMITATIONS- THE SPEAKER

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:33.217
REPRESENTING THE- LEIBER AT LAW

02:31:33.284 --> 02:31:36.086
FIRM WHO WORKS WITH AGENCIES-

02:31:36.153 --> 02:31:40.324
TALKED ABOUT- THE FLAWS IN IN IN

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:42.626
THE- EXEMPTIONS FOR POTENTIAL

02:31:42.693 --> 02:31:44.495
TOLLING WHERE THERE ARE SOME

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:45.663
WILL SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS IN

02:31:45.729 --> 02:31:48.032
THERE WON'T BE AN OPPORTUNITY.

02:31:48.098 --> 02:31:50.634
TO HOLD. INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE

02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:54.004
FOR WRONGDOING- YEP OF COURSE

02:31:54.071 --> 02:31:55.940
THAT THE IT THE ATTORNEY FOR-

02:31:56.006 --> 02:31:57.475
OUR LOCAL PEACE OFFICE HERE IN

02:31:57.541 --> 02:31:58.509
SACRAMENTO AND I BELIEVE CORRECT

02:31:58.576 --> 02:32:00.411
CALIFORNIA- MISTER MISS STAGNATE

02:32:00.478 --> 02:32:02.646
TALKED ABOUT HOW HE THINKS THAT

02:32:02.713 --> 02:32:05.216
IT'S SUFFICIENT I GUESS MY FIRST

02:32:05.282 --> 02:32:08.953
QUESTION IS FOR MR MISDIAGNOSIS-

02:32:09.019 --> 02:32:11.522
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD BE

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:14.291
THE FLAW HER EITHER YOU KNOW

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:16.460
WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE HARM. IF

02:32:16.527 --> 02:32:18.062
THE STATUE LIMITATIONS WAS

02:32:18.128 --> 02:32:20.397
CHANGED FROM A YEAR TO TWO YEARS

02:32:20.464 --> 02:32:22.800
OR THREE YEARS. OR ANY CHANGE AT

02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:24.335
ALL WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE

02:32:24.401 --> 02:32:26.837
POTENTIAL PUBLIC POLICY HARM IN

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:32.776
YOUR EYES. I THINK THAT IT. THE

02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:34.578
CURRENT LAW STRIKES THE RIGHT

02:32:34.645 --> 02:32:36.647
BALANCE AND- MISTER CARTY I

02:32:36.714 --> 02:32:38.616
DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW MY

02:32:38.682 --> 02:32:41.051
PRESENTATION I DID IMPAIRING THE

02:32:41.118 --> 02:32:44.255
STATUTES BUT IT RUNS FROM WHEN

02:32:44.321 --> 02:32:45.923
SOMEBODY MAKES A COMPLAINT NOT%

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:47.458
FROM WHEN THE CONDUCT OCCURRED

02:32:47.525 --> 02:32:49.460
SO IN PRACTICE IT'S NOT ONE YEAR

02:32:49.527 --> 02:32:50.995
FROM WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED

02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:53.097
IT'S ONE YEAR FROM WHEN THE

02:32:53.163 --> 02:32:55.232
AGENCY WAS MADE AWARE OF THE

02:32:55.299 --> 02:32:57.835
MISCONDUCT AND FRANKLY I THINK

02:32:57.902 --> 02:32:59.303
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS

02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:01.272
MISCONDUCT AND AN AGENCY WANTS

02:33:01.338 --> 02:33:03.340
TO TAKE MORE THAN ONE YEAR. TO

02:33:03.407 --> 02:33:04.575
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT

02:33:04.642 --> 02:33:06.577
OFFICERS FIT IT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND

02:33:06.644 --> 02:33:08.612
IT'S IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT

02:33:08.679 --> 02:33:10.281
THAT INVESTIGATION IS TIMELY

02:33:10.347 --> 02:33:12.983
COMPLETED AND IN MY EXPERIENCE

02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:14.618
IT'S NOT BANNED THE SERIOUS

02:33:14.685 --> 02:33:16.987
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT IT'S

02:33:17.054 --> 02:33:18.722
BEEN THE REALLY MINOR STUFF

02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:20.724
WHERE AGENCIES BLOW IT OFF

02:33:20.791 --> 02:33:23.093
BECAUSE THEY WHATEVER THEY'RE

02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.161
TRIAGING OF THEY DON'T THINK

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:25.329
IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S LIKE MISSING

02:33:25.396 --> 02:33:27.264
QUARTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:28.365
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE CAREER

02:33:28.432 --> 02:33:30.367
THREATENING BUT JUST FROM A GOOD

02:33:30.434 --> 02:33:32.202
EMPLOYER STANDPOINT IF YOU'VE

02:33:32.269 --> 02:33:35.806
GOT AN EMPLOYEE. THAT'S

02:33:35.873 --> 02:33:36.440
PERFORMING AT A DEFICIENT LEVELS

02:33:36.507 --> 02:33:38.008
. THIS IS JUST BASIC IS YOU NEED

02:33:38.075 --> 02:33:39.176
TO PUT THAT EMPLOYEE ON NOTICE

02:33:39.243 --> 02:33:40.411
WHETHER IT'S MCDONALD'S WHETHER

02:33:40.477 --> 02:33:42.479
IT'S A POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT.

02:33:42.546 --> 02:33:44.248
THEY'RE NOT MEETING STANDARDS

02:33:44.315 --> 02:33:45.382
AND THAT YOU NEED TO GET UP TO

02:33:45.449 --> 02:33:46.550
STANDARDS AND GO THROUGH

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:48.185
PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE IT DOES

02:33:48.252 --> 02:33:50.120
NOBODY ANY GOOD TO JUST LET

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:51.689
THINGS LINGER FOR A BEYOND A

02:33:51.755 --> 02:33:53.724
YEAR. AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:56.126
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE AN AGENCY

02:33:56.193 --> 02:33:57.828
WOULDN'T BE ABLETO DO IT I'VE

02:33:57.895 --> 02:33:59.530
NEVER SEEN IN MY TWENTY TWO

02:33:59.597 --> 02:34:01.432
YEARS OF PRACTICE. A SERIOUS

02:34:01.498 --> 02:34:03.467
ALLEGATION AND LIKE A USE OF

02:34:03.534 --> 02:34:05.102
FORCE OR A SEXUAL ASSAULT OR

02:34:05.169 --> 02:34:06.670
ANYTHING THAT'S COVERED BY S. B.

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:07.471
TWO WERE THE DISCLOSURE

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:10.140
STATUTES. GO BEYOND A YEAR IT'S

02:34:10.207 --> 02:34:11.809
BEEN MINOR STUFF SO YOUR

FOR PEOPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT IF IT

02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:36.200

NOT ELIGIBLE TO GET ANY KIND OF

SPECIALTY ASSIGNMENT NOT

02:34:51.382 --> 02:34:53.550
ELIGIBLE- TO PROMOTE OR

ADVANCEMENT AND IT CAN'T BE

FRANKLY USED AND I'M- EXCLUDING

02:34:58.355 --> 02:35:00.357
CHIEF RAMBO HERE. OF COURSE BUT

02:35:00.424 --> 02:35:01.759
THERE ARE SOME BAD SHE'S IN

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:03.961
THERE ARE SOME BAD MANAGERS THAT

02:35:04.028 --> 02:35:06.030
WILL MISUSE THE ABILITY TO DO

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:07.531
THESE THINGS AND SO THEY KNOW

02:35:07.598 --> 02:35:09.333
THAT DATE YOU KNOWS FOR INSTANCE

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:10.234
THAT AN ALLEGATION IS

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:12.169
UNWARRANTED. BUT HOLDEN OVER THE

02:35:12.236 --> 02:35:14.038
OFFICER'S HEAD INDEFINITELY SO

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:14.805
THAT THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY

02:35:14.872 --> 02:35:17.041
BLACKBALLED AND YOU MAYBE PUSH

02:35:17.107 --> 02:35:18.609
THEM OUT OF THE AGENCY BECAUSE

02:35:18.676 --> 02:35:20.778
THEIR CAREERS DAD THEY CAN'T GET

02:35:20.844 --> 02:35:22.980
INTO A SPECIALTY ASSIGNMENT THAT

02:35:23.047 --> 02:35:24.048
COULD LEAD TO A PROMOTION OR

02:35:24.114 --> 02:35:25.582
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I GAVE THE

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:28.752
EXAMPLE OF MY EXECUTOR WHO HAD A

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:30.220
GAG ORDER IN A CLOUD PUT

02:35:30.287 --> 02:35:31.388
OVERSIGHT SIMPLY FOR FILING A

02:35:31.455 --> 02:35:34.892
GRIEVANCE- ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:36.960
MEMBER COOPER WHEN HE WAS A

02:35:37.027 --> 02:35:39.663
POLICE CAPTAIN. AND SO I THINK

02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:40.964
THERE'S AN INTEREST ON BOTH

02:35:41.031 --> 02:35:42.433
SIDES IN HAVING THESE MATTERS

02:35:42.499 --> 02:35:45.335
RESOLVED TIMELY AND THEY REALLY

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:46.470
. THERE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

02:35:46.537 --> 02:35:48.706
THAT WOULD MAKE AN AGENCY UNABLE

02:35:48.772 --> 02:35:50.307
TO DO AN INVESTIGATION IF THE

02:35:50.374 --> 02:35:52.509
COMPLAINANT DOESN'T WANT TO COME

02:35:52.576 --> 02:35:53.110
FOR A WITNESS DOESN'T WANT TO

02:35:53.177 --> 02:35:55.713
COME FORWARD. EIGHT THEY'RE NOT

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:56.847
GONNA COME FORWARD I MEAN NOBODY

02:35:56.914 --> 02:35:58.248
CAN CONTROL THAT BUT WHAT THE

02:35:58.315 --> 02:36:00.951
AGENCY CAN CONTROL IS THAT THEY

02:36:01.018 --> 02:36:02.186
CAN CONTROL THE TIMING OF

02:36:02.252 --> 02:36:04.321
REACHING OUT TO THOSE WITNESSES.

02:36:04.388 --> 02:36:06.423
THEY CAN CONTROL THE TIMING OF

02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:08.192
THE INTERROGATION OF THE OFFICER

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:10.394
WHO'S THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND ONE

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:11.462
THING THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OFF

02:36:11.528 --> 02:36:12.930
TOPIC BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:36:12.996 --> 02:36:14.531
THAT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS.

02:36:14.598 --> 02:36:15.999
UNDER S. B. TWO IN THIS IS

02:36:16.066 --> 02:36:18.168
SOMETHING KORAC ADVOCATED FOR

02:36:18.235 --> 02:36:19.636
THE EMPLOYING AGENCY HAS TO

02:36:19.703 --> 02:36:21.038
COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION EVEN

02:36:21.105 --> 02:36:22.206
IF AN OFFICER LEAVES AND GO

02:36:22.272 --> 02:36:23.607
SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THAT THERE IS

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:25.843
A FINAL DETERMINATION. BOB AND

02:36:25.909 --> 02:36:28.212

GOING TO BE COMING INTO EFFECT

02:36:33.884 --> 02:36:35.886
IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE A SHARED

02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:51.341
IMPEDIMENT TO HOLDING THE

02:40:51.408 --> 02:40:53.710
OFFICER ACCOUNTABLE. UNTIL THERE

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:55.345
IS SOME SORT OF NOTIFICATION TO

02:40:55.412 --> 02:40:59.016
THE DEPARTMENT THE- HI ROB IF

02:40:59.082 --> 02:41:01.151
YOU WILL IS THERE ARE SOME

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:03.653
CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE THERE IS

02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.288
INFORMATION THAT USUALLY HAPPENS

02:41:05.355 --> 02:41:06.223
IN THE SCENARIO WHERE THE

02:41:06.289 --> 02:41:08.091
INFORMATION COMES TO US A

02:41:08.158 --> 02:41:10.927
SUPERVISOR OFFICER A SERGEANT.

02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:13.196
WHO IT CAN END UP THE PAID

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:14.398
ROVERS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES

02:41:14.464 --> 02:41:16.333
CASE AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:17.100
COMMITTEE TO READ IT IT'S A

02:41:17.167 --> 02:41:19.403
GOOD. TEACHING TOOL I THINK ON

02:41:19.469 --> 02:41:22.239
THIS POINT. BUT THE INFORMATION

02:41:22.305 --> 02:41:23.540
COMES INTO A SUPERVISOR WHO

02:41:23.607 --> 02:41:25.542
NEEDS TO LOOK INTO SOME THINGS

02:41:25.609 --> 02:41:26.610
TO DETERMINE WHETHER A

02:41:26.676 --> 02:41:29.746
MISCONDUCT EVEN OCCURRED OR NOT-

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:31.381
WHETHER THIS IS A REAL COMPLAINT

02:41:31.448 --> 02:41:34.251
OR NOT- AND THEN WHO THE OFFICER

02:41:34.317 --> 02:41:35.352
MIGHT BE AND IN THE PAPER OKAY

02:41:35.419 --> 02:41:38.255
USE. THE LAPD HAD TO DO SOME

02:41:38.321 --> 02:41:39.923
DIGGING INTO TO JUST FIGURE OUT

02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:41.158
HOW THE OFFICER WAS IN A

02:41:41.224 --> 02:41:42.592
PARTICULAR PATROL CAR AND IT

02:41:42.659 --> 02:41:44.061
TOOK HIM TEN OR ELEVEN DAYS TO

02:41:44.127 --> 02:41:46.163
DO THAT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:47.464
ULTIMATELY MISS THE STATUE

02:41:47.531 --> 02:41:49.366
LIMITATIONS JUST BY A MATTER OF

02:41:49.433 --> 02:41:51.868
A DAY OR TWO- AND THE COURT

02:41:51.935 --> 02:41:54.571
ULTIMATELY HELD IS WHAT THE WHAT

02:41:54.638 --> 02:41:55.405
THE COURT ULTIMATELY HOME THE

02:41:55.472 --> 02:41:57.541
PEDRO CASE WAS. THE DEPARTMENT

02:41:57.607 --> 02:42:01.845
WAS ON INQUIRY NOTICE. AND SO IT

02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:03.747
SHOULD UPS. DOES THIS OF STATURE

02:42:03.814 --> 02:42:05.315
WITH. WAS OR ELEVEN DAYS EARLIER

02:42:05.382 --> 02:42:07.117
BECAUSE OF THE SERGEANT.

02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:10.387
SHOULD'VE KNOWN THAT. HE NEEDED%

02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:11.588
TO START LOOKING INTO WHO THE

02:42:11.655 --> 02:42:13.924
INDIVIDUAL WAS AND HE WAS REALLY

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:15.392
THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS

02:42:15.459 --> 02:42:17.027
INVESTIGATOR IF YOU WILL NOT.

02:42:17.094 --> 02:42:18.328
WIN THE AND THE MATTER WAS

02:42:18.395 --> 02:42:20.497
ULTIMATELY. ASSIGNED TO AN

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:21.631
INVESTIGATOR ONCE FIGURE

02:42:21.698 --> 02:42:23.200
OUT WHO WOULD BE A THE OFFICER

02:42:23.266 --> 02:42:24.301
INVOLVED IN THE POTENTIAL

02:42:24.367 --> 02:42:26.603
MISCONDUCT WAS. AND SO I GUESS

02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:28.872
MY MAIN CONCERN WOULD BE ON THAT

02:42:28.939 --> 02:42:30.841
KIND OF. IS THE AREAS OF THE

02:42:30.907 --> 02:42:32.509
WHAT I CALL PRE INVESTIGATION

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:36.246
BIASA- SUPERVISING- OFFICER

02:42:36.313 --> 02:42:37.314
WHERE THEY LOOK INTO SOMETHING

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.315
THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:40.417
NOT SURE YET IF MISCONDUCT EVEN

02:42:40.484 --> 02:42:42.119
OCCURRED OR IF IT DID WHO WHO

02:42:42.185 --> 02:42:45.021
DID IT- WHO DID THE MISCONDUCT.

02:42:45.088 --> 02:42:46.890
YEAH IF THAT STARTS TO **** A

02:42:46.957 --> 02:42:49.326
MAGICIAN STARTS THE STATUE

02:42:49.392 --> 02:42:51.261
LIMITATIONS THAT CAN HELP. THE

02:42:51.328 --> 02:42:53.563
COMPANY IN A FAX AND WE DO

02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:56.032
COUNCIL OR OUR CLIENTS- ERR ON

02:42:56.099 --> 02:42:56.766
THE SIDE OF CAUTION IN THESE

02:42:56.833 --> 02:42:59.236
AREAS. YOU KNOW WAS ONE OF THE

02:42:59.302 --> 02:43:01.938
FIRST- INFORMATION COMING TO THE

02:43:02.005 --> 02:43:02.739
AGENCY BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T

02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:05.709
KNOW ALL- IN WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

02:43:05.775 --> 02:43:06.810
YOU KNOW A SERGEANT RECEIVED A

02:43:06.877 --> 02:43:11.915
PHONE CALL AND DIDN'T. TELL

02:43:11.982 --> 02:43:12.516
ANYBODY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:43:12.582 --> 02:43:13.817
AND SO. I THINK. IT THERE'S TWO

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:14.851
WAYS OF. IT ONE IS ADDRESS THE

02:43:14.918 --> 02:43:17.387
LENGTH TIME BUT ALSO GIVING AND

02:43:17.454 --> 02:43:19.356
PERHAPS MORE CLARITY ON WHEN THE

02:43:19.422 --> 02:43:20.924
STARTING OF THE STATUE

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:23.126
LIMITATIONS ACTUALLY. TAKES OFF

02:43:23.193 --> 02:43:25.362
OKAY THANK YOU AND LASTLY.

02:43:25.428 --> 02:43:26.897
MISTER CHAIR COMING GO TO

02:43:26.963 --> 02:43:30.500
PROFESSOR. NUMBER RANKO. AND ASK

02:43:30.567 --> 02:43:35.505
HER. TO QUESTIONS. WHAT ONE. DO

02:43:35.572 --> 02:43:37.107
YOU THINK THERE ARE IMPEDIMENTS

02:43:37.174 --> 02:43:40.911
IN CALIFORNIA IS- IMPLEMENTATION

02:43:40.977 --> 02:43:43.113
OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE YEAR AND

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:44.681
WHAT WAS JUST NOTICE BUT WHEN IT

02:43:44.748 --> 02:43:49.252
STARTS INTO- IS THERE. IS THERE-

02:43:49.319 --> 02:43:51.588
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER STATES

02:43:51.655 --> 02:43:53.890
AS FAR AS THIS IS THIS AND- IS

02:43:53.957 --> 02:43:55.158
THIS A NORMAL PRACTICE OR IN

02:43:55.225 --> 02:43:58.061
OTHER STATES AS THE- STATUE

02:43:58.128 --> 02:44:00.530
LIMITATIONS MUCH LONGER. THAT'S

02:44:00.597 --> 02:44:01.965
A GREAT QUESTION SO I THINK ON

02:44:02.032 --> 02:44:03.200
THE FIRST POINT THE CONCERN

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:04.601
REALLY IS AROUND THESE AND BIG

02:44:04.668 --> 02:44:07.971
US AT NOTIFICATIONS AT SO. IT'S

02:44:08.038 --> 02:44:10.740
WHEN THEY SEE ACT EITHER ISN'T

02:44:10.807 --> 02:44:12.876
SURE YOU KNOW WHO THE OFFICER IS

02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:13.944
A CASE IN CALIFORNIA THAT MADE

02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:15.779
CLEAR THAT ONCE THEY'RE PUT ON

02:44:15.845 --> 02:44:17.180
NOTICE THAT SOMETHING BAD

02:44:17.247 --> 02:44:18.348
HAPPENED EVEN IF THEY DON'T KNOW

02:44:18.415 --> 02:44:20.550
WHO'S- ON THE BALL BACK STARTS.

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:22.419
TO RUN AT AND SO I THINK

02:44:22.485 --> 02:44:23.753
CLARIFYING THAT AMBIGUITY WOULD

02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:26.990
PROBABLY GO. A LONG WAY ON THIS

02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:28.358
FIRST AND SHE'S LIMITATIONS MEAN

02:44:28.425 --> 02:44:29.259
HONESTLY THEY'VE VERY QUITE A

02:44:29.326 --> 02:44:35.165
BIT. LIMITATIONS SOME AGENCIES

02:44:35.232 --> 02:44:37.200
ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED AWAY EVEN

02:44:37.267 --> 02:44:38.368
SHORTER ONES UNDER COLLECTIVE

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:40.337
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS OUT THERE

02:44:40.403 --> 02:44:41.638
ARE SOME THAT ARE YOU KNOW

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:43.873
EGREGIOUSLY SHORT AB I THINK THE

02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:45.141
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS SOMETHING

02:44:45.208 --> 02:44:46.843
IN THAT TWO TO THREE YEAR RANGE

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:49.412
THAT WOULD GET YOU KNOW ADEQUATE

02:44:49.479 --> 02:44:51.014
SPACE FOR AGENCIES TO COMPLETE

02:44:51.081 --> 02:44:54.517
THOSE INVESTIGATIONS- IN THOSE

02:44:54.584 --> 02:44:56.019
KIND OF CASES WHERE IT MIGHT

02:44:56.086 --> 02:44:57.287
TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO REALLY

02:44:57.354 --> 02:44:59.623
FIGURE OUT. WHAT HAPPENED I JUST

02:44:59.689 --> 02:45:00.890
WANNA MAKE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON

02:45:00.957 --> 02:45:03.093
RANDY RIGHT SO WE WANT EACH OF

02:45:03.159 --> 02:45:04.361
THESE TO DO THIS QUICKLY WE WANT

02:45:04.427 --> 02:45:06.463
THE PUBLIC TO BE ANGRY WITH

02:45:06.529 --> 02:45:08.298
THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

02:45:08.365 --> 02:45:10.000
IF THEY'RE DRAGGING THEIR FEET.

02:45:10.066 --> 02:45:11.268
AT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE

02:45:11.334 --> 02:45:14.304
CONSEQUENCES WHEN AGENCY FAILS

02:45:14.371 --> 02:45:15.972
THAT I INVESTIGATE SOMETHING

02:45:16.039 --> 02:45:17.540
WITHIN A ONE YEAR LIMIT AND IF

02:45:17.607 --> 02:45:19.276
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFICER

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:21.411
GETS OFF THE HOOK AT THAT'S WHEN

02:45:21.478 --> 02:45:23.380
YOU START TO SEE A PROBLEM AND

02:45:23.446 --> 02:45:24.914
THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER MECHANISMS

02:45:24.981 --> 02:45:26.883
FOR ENSURING THAT AGENCIES. DO

02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:28.318
THIS WHILE INCLUDING APPS CITY

02:45:28.385 --> 02:45:29.619
COUNCIL OVERSIGHT NAY OR

02:45:29.686 --> 02:45:32.022
OVERSIGHT AND OTHER MECHANISMS

02:45:32.088 --> 02:45:35.759
FUNDING. AT TO SPEED THINGS

02:45:35.825 --> 02:45:37.360
ALONG. YES JUST CONCLUDING

02:45:37.427 --> 02:45:39.329
COMMENTS ON THIS- YOU KNOW I

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:41.031
DON'T WANT TO BE LOOKING AT

02:45:41.097 --> 02:45:42.966
SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM

02:45:43.033 --> 02:45:44.434
BUT- I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK

02:45:44.501 --> 02:45:45.935
I KNOW ENOUGH NOW THAT WE KNOW

02:45:46.002 --> 02:45:47.704
ENOUGH I KNOW THAT. YET THAT.

02:45:47.771 --> 02:45:48.972
YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TOURNEY

02:45:49.039 --> 02:45:50.140
THIS MISDIAGNOSIS AS NOT A

02:45:50.206 --> 02:45:51.474
PROBLEM EVERYTHING'S GOODNESS

02:45:51.541 --> 02:45:53.343
FRONT- BUT IF THERE ARE

02:45:53.410 --> 02:45:55.178
INDIVIDUALS OFFICERS THAT THAT

02:45:55.245 --> 02:45:56.846
SKATED ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE

02:45:56.913 --> 02:45:58.281
THEY RAN OUT THE CLOCK THAT'S

02:45:58.348 --> 02:45:59.282
WRONG. I THINK THAT'S WRONG FOR

02:45:59.349 --> 02:46:00.383
EVERYBODY MAKES THE GOOD

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:02.952
OFFICERS LOOK BAD AND SO- YOU

02:46:03.019 --> 02:46:03.953
KNOW I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING

02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:07.957
WORTHY OF EXPLORATION. AND YOU

02:46:08.024 --> 02:46:08.458
KNOW WITH THAT CERTAINLY

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:10.393
SOMETHING I'LL LOOK INTO- BUT

02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:11.227
THANK YOU MISTER GETS THAT'S ALL

02:46:11.294 --> 02:46:12.696

THAT MISTER MISS STAGNATE TALKED

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:26.910
ABOUT. HIS PRESENTATION WAS THAT

02:46:26.976 --> 02:46:30.380
WHICH WAS I OPENING HE TALKED

02:46:30.447 --> 02:46:32.749
ABOUT THE IN OUR BE- NOT-

02:46:32.816 --> 02:46:35.085
THERE'S NO IN OUR BE. PROCESS

02:46:35.151 --> 02:46:37.487
FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES- IN THE

02:46:37.554 --> 02:46:41.658
LOOK AT THE WHOLE BAR ITSELF-

02:46:41.725 --> 02:46:43.360
AND THEN YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE

02:46:43.426 --> 02:46:45.362
QUESTION OF MAYBE I'LL ASK THE

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:47.530
QUESTION SO IT LOOKS WHY DO YOU

02:46:47.597 --> 02:46:49.432
DON'T THINK THAT WE THAT THE

02:46:49.499 --> 02:46:51.401
POLICE AT THAT SCARES ME YEP.

02:46:51.468 --> 02:46:54.337
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES HAVE SUCH AN IN

02:46:54.404 --> 02:46:58.441
R. V. IN RB- PROCESS WITH AND

02:46:58.508 --> 02:46:59.709
BECAUSE THESE ARE UNION THIS IS

02:46:59.776 --> 02:47:01.878
I'M OF THE POLICE OFFICERS- PULL

02:47:01.945 --> 02:47:05.882
BAR IS IT'S THE SAME THING-

02:47:05.949 --> 02:47:08.218
GIVING EMPLOYEES RIGHTS JUST

02:47:08.284 --> 02:47:10.019
LIKE ANY OTHER UNION A

02:47:10.086 --> 02:47:11.321
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

02:47:11.388 --> 02:47:14.224
RIGHT- ONE IS SET FOR PRIVATE

02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:16.493
AND ONE IS THAT THE PUBLIC. BUT

02:47:16.559 --> 02:47:18.261
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE

02:47:18.328 --> 02:47:21.831
OF POLICING AND THERE PIECE OFF

02:47:21.898 --> 02:47:23.733
THE BILL OF RIGHTS- DO YOU THINK

02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:25.635
THAT IN ARE BEING COULD BE US A

02:47:25.702 --> 02:47:30.573
GOOD PLACE. FOR THEM TO END UP

02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:31.174
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. ARE YOU

02:47:31.241 --> 02:47:35.311
FOLLOWING THE- I AM AT SO YOU

02:47:35.378 --> 02:47:36.212
KNOW THIS GOES A LITTLE BIT

02:47:36.279 --> 02:47:37.614
BEYOND MY EXPERTISE I'M NOT A

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:39.516
LABOR LAWYER I WRITE ABOUT

02:47:39.582 --> 02:47:41.584
POLICING MINISTER GOVERNMENT

02:47:41.651 --> 02:47:43.353
MORE BROADLY- YOU KNOW I

02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:45.588
UNDERSTAND MR AT STAGNATE IT SAY

02:47:45.655 --> 02:47:46.689
THAT YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:47:46.756 --> 02:47:48.091
ACTUALLY HAVE KIND OF AN

02:47:48.158 --> 02:47:50.360
ANALOGOUS AT SIDE OF PUBLIC

02:47:50.427 --> 02:47:53.930
SECTOR EMPLOYEE RIGHT- I THINK

02:47:53.997 --> 02:47:55.432
THE QUESTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE

02:47:55.498 --> 02:47:57.700
TO REALLY FOCUS ON IS ACT HOW

02:47:57.767 --> 02:47:59.102
THE SORTS OF RIGHTS PLAY OUT IN

02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:00.537
THE CONTEXT OF POLICING

02:48:00.603 --> 02:48:01.604
PARTICULARLY THIS KIND OF

02:48:01.671 --> 02:48:03.139
OVERLAP BETWEEN INVESTIGATIONS

02:48:03.206 --> 02:48:04.974
AND SUPERVISION. RIGHT SO YOU

02:48:05.041 --> 02:48:06.075
KNOW ONCE A COMPLAINT IS FILED

02:48:06.142 --> 02:48:07.310
AND THERE'S A FORMAL

02:48:07.377 --> 02:48:09.112
INVESTIGATION AGAINST AN OFFICER

02:48:09.179 --> 02:48:10.480
A LOT OF THE RATES THAT KICK IN

02:48:10.547 --> 02:48:14.651

ROLE IMPORTANT FOR ALL LOOKS. I

02:48:35.672 --> 02:48:37.373
THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS OVER

02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:38.942

BARRIERS TO KIND OF SUPERVISION

02:48:43.213 --> 02:48:44.514
AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT MAY NOT

02:48:44.581 --> 02:48:46.449
HAVE AS MUCH TRACTION IN. THE

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:48.985
CONTEXT OF YEAH. THE BUS DRIVER

02:48:49.052 --> 02:48:50.320
YOUR OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:51.621
EMPLOYEES AND SO THE IMPACT OF

02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:53.156

02:48:56.526 --> 02:48:58.094
POSITION TO KIND OF SPEAK TO

02:48:58.161 --> 02:49:00.263

EMPLOYEE- AND WITHOUT THAT WE

02:49:27.924 --> 02:49:29.659

WE BELIEVE UNJUST TERMINATIONS

02:49:34.464 --> 02:49:35.231
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE

02:49:35.298 --> 02:49:37.467
BECAUSE- THERE. ISN'T SUCH IN

02:49:37.534 --> 02:49:39.969
PLACE. I WANT TO ASK. MR

02:49:40.036 --> 02:49:41.871
STAGNANT QUESTION IN YOUR

YOU GIVE US EXAMPLES OF WHAT-

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:52.482
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. WOULD- KICK

02:49:52.549 --> 02:49:55.785
INTO PLACE- UNDER A PEACE

02:49:55.852 --> 02:49:57.754
OFFICER'S BILL OF RIGHTS. GIVE

02:49:57.820 --> 02:49:59.389
US SITUATIONS THAT THIS WOULD

02:49:59.455 --> 02:50:05.028
AUTOMATICALLY. BE IMPLEMENTED.

02:50:05.094 --> 02:50:05.929
SO IF UNDERSTAND QUESTION

02:50:05.995 --> 02:50:08.031
QUESTION. IT IT IN THE CONTEXT

02:50:08.097 --> 02:50:08.998
OF LIKE THE TOLLING AGREEMENT

02:50:09.065 --> 02:50:12.201
FOR EXAMPLE. WHATEVER

02:50:12.268 --> 02:50:13.836
ALLEGATIONS MISCONDUCT IS GOING

02:50:13.903 --> 02:50:15.038
TO BE SUBJECT TO THESE BASIC

02:50:15.104 --> 02:50:16.940
PROCEDURAL RIGHTS ABOUT NOTICE

02:50:17.006 --> 02:50:18.474
AND HAVING AN ATTORNEY THERE IF

02:50:18.541 --> 02:50:19.642
THERE'S A LIGHT SO YOU'RE

02:50:19.709 --> 02:50:21.311
TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT

02:50:21.377 --> 02:50:23.413
LIKE I USE THAT FOR SIR USED TO

02:50:23.479 --> 02:50:25.281
DEADLY FORCE THERE'S GONNA BE A

02:50:25.348 --> 02:50:27.617
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THAT IS

02:50:27.684 --> 02:50:29.552
GONNA TAKE PRIMARY OVER THE

02:50:29.619 --> 02:50:31.354
ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION

02:50:31.421 --> 02:50:32.755
NONE OF THE POPE OUR RIGHTS ARE

02:50:32.822 --> 02:50:33.656
GOING TO BE A PLAY ON THE

02:50:33.723 --> 02:50:35.325
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND ALL

02:50:35.391 --> 02:50:37.727
OF THE TIME ON DAY ONE STATUTE

02:50:37.794 --> 02:50:39.362
OF LIMITATIONS IS GONNA PULL

02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:41.197
WHILE THAT'S GOING ON. SO THE

02:50:41.264 --> 02:50:42.298
DISTINCTION THAT I'M TRYING TO

02:50:42.365 --> 02:50:44.601
MAKE IS THAT ON SOMETHING

02:50:44.667 --> 02:50:45.935
SERIOUS IT'S GONNA GET

02:50:46.002 --> 02:50:48.137
INVESTIGATED RIGHT AWAY. THE ONE

02:50:48.204 --> 02:50:49.672
INSTANCE I CAN RECALL OF THERE

02:50:49.739 --> 02:50:51.474
EVER BEING A VIOLATION OF THE

02:50:51.541 --> 02:50:53.343
ONE YEAR TIME LIMITATION IT WAS

02:50:53.409 --> 02:50:55.078
SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER SHELDON

02:50:55.144 --> 02:50:55.979
WAS DESCRIBING IT WAS A

02:50:56.045 --> 02:50:58.381
SITUATION WHERE I OFFICER WAS IN

02:50:58.448 --> 02:50:59.816
AN ACCIDENT REPORTED TO HIS

02:50:59.882 --> 02:51:01.718
SUPERVISOR WHO REPORTED TO THE

02:51:01.784 --> 02:51:03.419
TRAFFIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. TO

02:51:03.486 --> 02:51:04.887
LOOK INTO IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH

02:51:04.954 --> 02:51:06.189
AND THEN THEY WERE REFERRED OVER

02:51:06.255 --> 02:51:08.091
TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND THE

02:51:08.157 --> 02:51:09.492
DEPARTMENT SAID OKAY YOU'RE FROM

02:51:09.559 --> 02:51:11.260
INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THEY WERE

02:51:11.327 --> 02:51:13.029
GLUED TO TIME BY A MONTH. IT'S

02:51:13.096 --> 02:51:14.263
NOT SOMETHING THAT SERIOUS

02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:15.798
MISCONDUCT IN THE SENSE THAT AN

02:51:15.865 --> 02:51:17.133
OFFICER IS GOING TO GET FIRED

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:18.935
WHAT THERE'S ALLEGATIONS OF

02:51:19.002 --> 02:51:21.404
CRIMINAL CONDUCT ON DUTY. IT'S

02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:23.272
NOT SOMETHING WHERE I WOULD ASK

02:51:23.339 --> 02:51:24.707
I MEAN IT'S ALL OF THESE IS WHY

02:51:24.774 --> 02:51:26.743
WAIT TILL THE LAST DAY ON A YEAR

02:51:26.809 --> 02:51:27.977
IF THERE'S AN OFFICER THAT HAS

02:51:28.044 --> 02:51:30.380
AN ISSUE WITH THEIR DRIVING YOU

02:51:30.446 --> 02:51:32.682
SHOULD REMEDY IT IMMEDIATELY OR

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:34.817
AT LEAST IN A TIMELY FASHION AND

02:51:34.884 --> 02:51:35.585
I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE

02:51:35.652 --> 02:51:37.620
QUESTION. AND IF YOU'RE WAITING

02:51:37.687 --> 02:51:39.589
FOR THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR AND

02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:40.757
YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT ON THE LAST

02:51:40.823 --> 02:51:41.958
DAY OF THE YEAR FROM WHEN YOU

02:51:42.025 --> 02:51:44.193
RECEIVE THE COMPLAINT BECAUSE OF

02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:45.928
THIS STATUTE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

02:51:45.995 --> 02:51:47.864
TAKE THAT STATUE AWAY. THEN

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:48.998
THEY'LL JUST GET AROUND TO IT

02:51:49.065 --> 02:51:49.999
WHENEVER THEY GET AROUND TO IT

02:51:50.066 --> 02:51:52.101
MAYBE IT'S TWO YEARS LATER MAYBE

02:51:52.168 --> 02:51:52.869
THREE YEARS LATER AND WHAT GOOD

02:51:52.935 --> 02:51:54.804
DOES IT DO TO DISCIPLINE

02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:55.471
SOMEBODY FOR GETTING IN A

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:58.307
CHARGEABLE- ACCIDENT ON DUTY

02:51:58.374 --> 02:51:59.876
THREE YEARS AFTER IT HAPPENS.

02:51:59.942 --> 02:52:02.245
WHAT I MEAN MY SANITY OFTEN GET

02:52:02.311 --> 02:52:04.113
RETRAINED IN A IN A PROMPT IN A

02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:06.249
TIMELY MANNER AND SO THAT'S THE

02:52:06.315 --> 02:52:08.384
MAIN DISTINCTION THAT THAT I'M

02:52:08.451 --> 02:52:13.690
TALKING. ABOUT ON TERMS OF WHAT

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:15.124
HOW I WOULD DEFINE A SERIES.

02:52:15.191 --> 02:52:17.093
MISCONDUCT I THINK THEY- THE- IS

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:20.296
DONE A JOB THAT. THROUGH THE HAD

02:52:20.363 --> 02:52:21.731
THE PENAL CODE HAS BEEN AMENDED

02:52:21.798 --> 02:52:23.766
NOW WITH SB SIXTEEN AND THERE'S

02:52:23.833 --> 02:52:24.534
A DEFINITION OF WHAT ARE

02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:27.870
SERIOUS- I'M MISCONDUCT SB TWO

02:52:27.937 --> 02:52:30.506
ALSO. HAS A LITTLE BIT LESS

02:52:30.573 --> 02:52:32.675
REFINED BUT PRETTY SIMILAR TYPE

02:52:32.742 --> 02:52:34.744
DEFINITIONS. I MEAN WHEN YOU

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:35.912
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AN OFFICER

02:52:35.978 --> 02:52:37.513
THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW

02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:39.215
POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL IS MAYBE.

02:52:39.282 --> 02:52:40.683
NOT THE ONLY BRIGHT LINE BUT IS

02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:42.085
A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT VERSES

02:52:42.151 --> 02:52:43.152
THERE'S THINGS ARE JUST

02:52:43.219 --> 02:52:44.587
PERFORMANCE ISSUES. YOU'RE NOT

02:52:44.654 --> 02:52:45.555
DRIVING GREAT YOU'RE NOT

02:52:45.621 --> 02:52:47.957
INVESTIGATING GREAT- YOU KNOW

02:52:48.024 --> 02:52:49.926
YOU HAVE A PUNCTUALITY PROBLEM

02:52:49.992 --> 02:52:50.927
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN

02:52:50.993 --> 02:52:52.729
EVERY PROFESSION. AND YOU DON'T

02:52:52.795 --> 02:52:54.263
FIRE SOMEBODY FROM PROSECUTING

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:55.565
FORM BUT YOU TAKE CORRECTIVE

02:52:55.631 --> 02:52:56.866
MEASURES HEY YOU NEED TO START

02:52:56.933 --> 02:52:58.468
SHOWING UP TO WORK ON TIME. I

02:52:58.534 --> 02:52:59.469
MEAN IF I HAD AN EMPLOYEE THAT

02:52:59.535 --> 02:53:00.970
WAS SHOWING UP PARTY EVERY DAY I

02:53:01.037 --> 02:53:02.505
WOULDN'T WAIT A YEAR. TO TELL

02:53:02.572 --> 02:53:03.206
THEM THAT THEY NEED TO DO

02:53:03.272 --> 02:53:05.141
IMPROVE THEIR ATTENDANCE. SO

02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:06.943
WHAT I'M HEARING. JUST FOR THE

02:53:07.009 --> 02:53:09.278
PUBLIC EDUCATION IS THAT- PULL

02:53:09.345 --> 02:53:11.547
BAR KICKSTAND- JUST AS YOU

02:53:11.614 --> 02:53:13.182
DESCRIBED. IF A POLICE OFFICER

02:53:13.249 --> 02:53:15.351
GETS IN THE ACCIDENT- THERE'S A

02:53:15.418 --> 02:53:18.254
VESTED GEISHA- HE HAS TO HAVE

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:20.423
UNION REPRESENTATION HE HAS

02:53:20.490 --> 02:53:22.492
PULLED MARKETS IS INVOKED. IN

02:53:22.558 --> 02:53:24.794
THAT PARTICULAR SCENARIO HOWEVER

02:53:24.861 --> 02:53:27.163
WHEN THEY'RE- ADULTS. I'M SORRY

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:28.631
I DIDN'T. I THINK THAT'S A

02:53:28.698 --> 02:53:30.199
LITTLE BIT TOO BROAD THE STATUTE

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:32.301
ACTUALLY DEFINES IT. IT'S WHEN

02:53:32.368 --> 02:53:33.369
THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF

02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:35.037
MISCONDUCT OR QUESTIONING REALLY

02:53:35.104 --> 02:53:36.939
ON THAT ON THE PROCEDURAL PARKS

02:53:37.006 --> 02:53:37.874
WHEN THERE'S A QUESTIONING BY A

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:40.309
SUPERVISOR. THAT COULD LEAD TO

02:53:40.376 --> 02:53:42.011
DISCIPLINE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

02:53:42.078 --> 02:53:43.746
OF THE SUPERVISOR SILVA

02:53:43.813 --> 02:53:45.214
SUPERVISOR IS GOING TO AN

02:53:45.281 --> 02:53:47.817
OFFICER IN ST- HEY YOU'RE DOING

02:53:47.884 --> 02:53:50.119

WRITING I'M NOT GONNA DISCIPLINE

02:53:50.853 --> 02:53:51.954
HIM SHOULD TELL YOU TO DO

02:53:52.021 --> 02:53:53.189
BETTER. THAN KHOBAR DOESN'T EVEN

02:53:53.256 --> 02:53:54.357
COME INTO PLAY THEY HAVE OR

02:53:54.423 --> 02:53:55.725
THAT'S JUST A ROUTINE COUNSELING

02:53:55.792 --> 02:53:56.692
AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DO

02:53:56.759 --> 02:53:58.628
THAT. IT'S ONLY WHEN DISCIPLINE

02:53:58.694 --> 02:54:00.429
IS IN THE PICTURE IS. A LAYMAN'S

02:54:00.496 --> 02:54:01.964
WAY OF SAYING IT AND IT'S FROM

02:54:02.031 --> 02:54:03.933
THE SUPERVISORS PERSPECTIVE IF

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:05.168
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OFFICER

02:54:05.234 --> 02:54:07.036
FOR POTENTIAL DISCIPLINE. THEN

02:54:07.103 --> 02:54:08.104
THEY HAVE TO PAY THE OFFICER

02:54:08.171 --> 02:54:13.876
LOOKING AT. YOU FOR POTENTIAL

02:54:13.943 --> 02:54:14.477

GROW BIGGEST AND SO I'M GOING

02:54:23.486 --> 02:54:24.487
YOU CLEAR THAT BECAUSE THINK

02:54:24.554 --> 02:54:26.022
SOME PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC WOULD

02:54:26.088 --> 02:54:27.990
THINK THAT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

02:54:28.057 --> 02:54:31.160
A POLICE OFFICER AND- ALLEGATION

02:54:31.227 --> 02:54:33.629
OF THE USE OF FORCE OR DEADLY

02:54:33.696 --> 02:54:35.898

02:54:56.519 --> 02:54:58.387
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO- USE OF

PARTICULAR PER VIEW- THAT

02:55:29.418 --> 02:55:30.286
POTENTIALLY COULD LEAD TO

02:55:30.353 --> 02:55:32.255
DISCIPLINE FROM A COMMANDING

02:55:32.321 --> 02:55:35.858

FORCE IT IS A CRIMINAL

02:55:41.564 --> 02:55:43.165
INVESTIGATION AT THAT POINT POPE

02:55:43.232 --> 02:55:45.234
OURS NOT EVEN IN THE PICTURE YOU

02:55:45.301 --> 02:55:46.836
TYPICALLY ARE GONNA HAVE TO

LOOKING AT THAT IF IT'S A

02:55:50.573 --> 02:55:51.140
FIFTEEN OH SIX CASE THEN YOU'RE

02:55:51.207 --> 02:55:51.874
GONNA HAVE THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL'S OFFICE LOOKING AT IT.

02:55:53.876 --> 02:55:54.977
AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:55.845
ARE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THE

02:55:55.912 --> 02:55:59.015
INVESTIGATION- SIDE BY SIDE WITH

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:01.284
WHATEVER THAT. THE LOCAL LAW

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:02.885
ENFORCEMENT IN THE JURISDICTIONS

02:56:02.952 --> 02:56:04.787
THAT OCCURRED AND NONE OF THESE

02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:07.623
RIGHTS APPLY THE ONLY WAY THAT

02:56:07.690 --> 02:56:09.358
ANY OF THAT PEACE OFFICER BILL

02:56:09.425 --> 02:56:11.227
OF RIGHTS WOULD COME INTO PLAY.

02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:12.528
IS IT AFTER THAT CRIMINAL

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:14.664
INVESTIGATION SEPARATE FROM THE

02:56:14.730 --> 02:56:16.032
DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO

02:56:16.098 --> 02:56:17.533
CHARGE THE OFFICER THE AGENCY

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:19.702
DECIDES TO FIRE THE OFFICER THEN

02:56:19.769 --> 02:56:21.203
THE APPEAL RIGHTS KICK IN BUT AS

02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:23.306
I MENTIONED BEFORE. THEY'RE NOT

02:56:23.372 --> 02:56:24.540
THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF

02:56:24.607 --> 02:56:26.175
SUBSTANCE ON THE APPEAL RIGHTS

02:56:26.242 --> 02:56:28.544
IN THAT. IN THE STATUTE IT'S

02:56:28.611 --> 02:56:30.246

YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE NLRB WHY

02:56:37.486 --> 02:56:39.088

HAVE REPRESENTATION RIGHTS AND

02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:42.525

BASED ON NEPOTISM OR CORRUPTION.

02:56:50.066 --> 02:56:51.200
AND THAT YOU HAVE VARIANCE I

02:56:51.267 --> 02:56:52.835

03:01:51.767 --> 03:01:53.002

AROUND THE BUSH- AND SO THAT THE

03:01:55.571 --> 03:01:56.905
QUALITY OF THE QUESTION LOOKING

AT DEPENDING ON THE ALLEGATIONS.

03:01:58.741 --> 03:02:00.576
ARE SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW

03:02:00.643 --> 03:02:02.945
USUALLY AS IS DISCUSSED I HAD A

03:02:03.012 --> 03:02:04.446
TIME SO THAT YOU CAN TAILOR YOUR

03:02:04.513 --> 03:02:07.750
YOUR INVESTIGATION TO REALLY GET

03:02:07.816 --> 03:02:09.685
TO THE CRUX OF THE ACTUAL

03:02:09.752 --> 03:02:11.720
ALLEGATION. AND NOT VEER TOO FAR

03:02:11.787 --> 03:02:14.023
OFF INTO SPECULATION AND OTHER

03:02:14.089 --> 03:02:16.258
ISSUES. LIMIT LIMIT HAVE A

03:02:16.325 --> 03:02:17.760
FOLLOW QUESTION SHOULD A THIRD

03:02:17.826 --> 03:02:20.029
PARTY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:02:20.095 --> 03:02:22.097
EVALUATE THE QUESTIONS. SHOULD A

03:02:22.164 --> 03:02:24.166
THIRD PARTY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:26.568
TO EVALUATE THE QUESTIONS. I

03:02:26.635 --> 03:02:27.670
DON'T IS VERY BROAD BUT IT DOES

03:02:27.736 --> 03:02:32.074
NOT. PLEASE IF YOU'RE ASKING

03:02:32.141 --> 03:02:32.808
LIKE SHOULD THERE BE JUDICIAL

03:02:32.875 --> 03:02:35.244
OVERSIGHT. I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE

03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:37.513
IT BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

03:02:37.579 --> 03:02:39.715
WHAT OFTEN NOT OFTEN- MOST

03:02:39.782 --> 03:02:41.283
INVESTIGATORS DO A GOOD JOB TO

03:02:41.350 --> 03:02:43.886
BE FAIR BUT SOMETIMES THEY ASK

03:02:43.952 --> 03:02:44.753
WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE

03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:46.522
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS BEYOND

03:02:46.588 --> 03:02:50.259
THE SCOPE OR DELVING INTO-

03:02:50.326 --> 03:02:52.361
PERSONAL MATTERS THAT ARE. FAR

03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:53.696
AFIELD FROM WHAT'S UNDER

03:02:53.762 --> 03:02:55.831
INVESTIGATION OR ASK FOR LEGAL

03:02:55.898 --> 03:02:57.566
CONCLUSIONS OR THINGS LIKE THAT

03:02:57.633 --> 03:02:59.668
AND I A INVESTIGATION IS NOT A

03:02:59.735 --> 03:03:00.269
COURT OF LAW IT'S NOT A

03:03:00.336 --> 03:03:02.104
DEPOSITION I DON'T REPRESENTING

03:03:02.171 --> 03:03:04.039
OFFICER I CAN MAKE AN OBJECTION

03:03:04.106 --> 03:03:05.874
ON THE RECORD BUT I DON'T HAVE

03:03:05.941 --> 03:03:08.477
THE ABILITY TO INSTRUCT THE

03:03:08.544 --> 03:03:09.511
OFFICER NOT TO ANSWER THE

03:03:09.578 --> 03:03:12.314
QUESTION. OR TO GO GET A JUDGE%

03:03:12.381 --> 03:03:15.284
HAS- DISCOVERY RAFFERTY LIKE YOU

03:03:15.351 --> 03:03:18.554
WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEPOSITION-

03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:20.856
TWO. TO INTERJECT ON HERE AND SO

03:03:20.923 --> 03:03:22.925
IF I INSTRUCT MY CLIENT NOT TO

03:03:22.991 --> 03:03:24.993
ANSWER A QUESTION AND I'M WRONG

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:27.162
THEN MY CLIENT'S GONNA PROBABLY

03:03:27.229 --> 03:03:28.731
GET FIRED I'M PROBABLY GONNA GET

03:03:28.797 --> 03:03:31.033
SUED FOR MALPRACTICE. SO THE

03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:33.135
AMOUNT OF POWER AND CONTROL THAT

03:03:33.202 --> 03:03:35.504
THE AGENCY AND THE INVESTIGATORS

03:03:35.571 --> 03:03:36.905
HAVE IS VERY VERY

03:03:36.972 --> 03:03:38.907
DISPROPORTIONATELY SKEWED

03:03:38.974 --> 03:03:41.110
AGAINST THE OFFICER COMPARED TO

03:03:41.176 --> 03:03:43.312
PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER KIND- THE

03:03:43.379 --> 03:03:44.346
JUDICIAL PROCEEDING OR

03:03:44.413 --> 03:03:47.449
QUESTIONING. THAT ANY OTHER

03:03:47.516 --> 03:03:50.018
CITIZEN WOULD BE SUBJECT TO. IF

03:03:50.085 --> 03:03:52.788
I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT. I

03:03:52.855 --> 03:03:54.256
THINK IT IS UNNECESSARY TO HAVE

03:03:54.323 --> 03:03:55.924
A THIRD AYE AYE AS A PRACTICAL

03:03:55.991 --> 03:03:57.192
MATTER I THINK IT WOULD BOG DOWN

03:03:57.259 --> 03:03:59.261
THE PROCESS TO HAVE THE

03:03:59.328 --> 03:04:01.130
QUESTIONS IF YOU'LL SCREEN BY

03:04:01.196 --> 03:04:03.365
SOME THIRD PARTY. AND AS A

03:04:03.432 --> 03:04:05.734
PRACTICAL MATTER- THERE IS AN

03:04:05.801 --> 03:04:07.169
OPPORTUNITY FOR THIRD PARTY

03:04:07.236 --> 03:04:09.405
REVIEW- AND IT'S THROUGH THE

03:04:09.471 --> 03:04:11.206
DISCIPLINE IN THE APPEAL PROCESS

03:04:11.273 --> 03:04:13.075
AND ALL THE WAY YOU KNOW TO THE

03:04:13.142 --> 03:04:14.710
COURT SYSTEM WITH THE WRIT OF

03:04:14.777 --> 03:04:16.345
ADMINISTRATIVE MAN DAMOS

03:04:16.412 --> 03:04:21.116
PROCESS- IF THE INVESTIGATOR-

03:04:21.183 --> 03:04:23.385
GOES OVERBOARD- ORDERS OUT OF

03:04:23.452 --> 03:04:25.854
BALANCE- MISTER MISTER.

03:04:25.921 --> 03:04:27.523
CHALLENGE THAT YOU CAN CHALLENGE

03:04:27.589 --> 03:04:28.791
AND FROM THE HEARING OFFICER

03:04:28.857 --> 03:04:30.058
FROM THE CIVIL SERVICE

03:04:30.125 --> 03:04:30.626
COMMISSION IN FRONT OF THE

03:04:30.692 --> 03:04:33.262
PERSONNEL BOARD AND IF THEY GO

03:04:33.328 --> 03:04:34.997
ALONG WITH THE INVESTIGATOR AND

03:04:35.063 --> 03:04:36.231
HE STILL DISAGREES HE CAN TAKE

03:04:36.298 --> 03:04:38.200
THAT UP TO THE COURTS AND THEY

03:04:38.267 --> 03:04:39.635
WILL ADDRESS IT THERE AND SO BUT

03:04:39.701 --> 03:04:41.270
IT IS ALL DONE AFTER THE FACT

03:04:41.336 --> 03:04:44.273
ADMITTEDLY. I THINK TRYING TO.

03:04:44.339 --> 03:04:47.142
IMPOSE A THIRD PARTY. IN ALL AT

03:04:47.209 --> 03:04:50.813
THE INTERROGATION STAGE- IS ONLY

03:04:50.879 --> 03:04:54.116
GOING TO SLOW THINGS DOWN- IN

03:04:54.183 --> 03:04:56.051
THE PROCESS IN. THE LAST POINT

03:04:56.118 --> 03:04:58.020
ON THIS- WELL THERE ARE

03:04:58.086 --> 03:04:59.455
DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF

03:04:59.521 --> 03:05:01.557
INVESTIGATORS- THROUGHOUT THE

03:05:01.623 --> 03:05:03.725
STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDOUBTEDLY-

03:05:03.792 --> 03:05:06.462
MOST- SEEK OUT SPECIAL TRAINING

03:05:06.528 --> 03:05:07.529
TO BE AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS

03:05:07.596 --> 03:05:09.531
INVESTIGATOR- POST PROVIDES

03:05:09.598 --> 03:05:12.134
TRAININGS I KNOW HAT THERE'S A

03:05:12.201 --> 03:05:14.102
LOT OF TRAINING- PROVIDED TO

03:05:14.169 --> 03:05:16.171
THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY GO OUT OF

03:05:16.238 --> 03:05:18.106
THEIR WAY NOT TO ASK ANY

03:05:18.173 --> 03:05:20.042
QUESTIONS ARE TRAINED NOT TO DO

03:05:20.108 --> 03:05:21.343
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE BEST

03:05:21.410 --> 03:05:24.179
PRACTICES- WAYS TO CONDUCT AN

03:05:24.246 --> 03:05:25.747
EFFECTIVE FAIR AND THOROUGH

03:05:25.814 --> 03:05:27.349
INVESTIGATION WITHOUT. ARE

03:05:27.416 --> 03:05:28.750
VIOLATING OFFICERS RIGHTS BUT

03:05:28.817 --> 03:05:30.752
ALSO GETTING TO THE TRUTH OF THE

03:05:30.819 --> 03:05:33.555
MATTER AND- INJECTING A JUST

03:05:33.622 --> 03:05:38.026
ANOTHER LAYER I THINK WOULD DO

03:05:38.093 --> 03:05:38.627
PROBABLY MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

03:05:38.694 --> 03:05:40.829
YOU MEASURE CHINA FOR TWO

03:05:40.896 --> 03:05:42.698
SECONDS SURE GREATHEAD CHIEF

03:05:42.764 --> 03:05:44.433
RAMBLE SO JUST TO YOUR POINT I

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:45.400
THINK WHAT THE POINT YOU'RE

03:05:45.467 --> 03:05:46.535
REALLY TRYING TO MAKE IS THE

03:05:46.602 --> 03:05:48.136
INTEGRITY OF THE INVESTIGATION

03:05:48.203 --> 03:05:50.072
THE INTEGRITY OF- THE INITIAL

03:05:50.138 --> 03:05:52.641
INVESTIGATION ON ITS- ON THE

03:05:52.708 --> 03:05:57.045
ONSET- I THINK THAT- AS A CHIEF-

03:05:57.112 --> 03:05:58.413
IF I HAD IT YEAH A

03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:00.749
CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING- ARMED.

03:06:00.816 --> 03:06:01.917
HERE INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT THAT

03:06:01.984 --> 03:06:04.353
I'M IN OR PERHAPS IF I'M IN- IN

03:06:04.419 --> 03:06:05.487
THIS YEAR'S DEPARTMENT WORKING

03:06:05.554 --> 03:06:07.422
WITH FOLKS THAT ARE- SKILL

03:06:07.489 --> 03:06:10.225
RETURNS. DATA PARTICULARLY ON

03:06:10.292 --> 03:06:11.260
SUCH A SERIOUS CASES

03:06:11.326 --> 03:06:12.895
PARTICULARLY LIKE USES OF FORCE

03:06:12.961 --> 03:06:14.296
FOR PERSON HAS ACTUALLY

03:06:14.363 --> 03:06:16.098
SUCCUMBED AND PASSED AWAY- I

03:06:16.164 --> 03:06:18.467
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

03:06:18.534 --> 03:06:20.502
TRANSPARENCY PART TO CONSIDER.

03:06:20.569 --> 03:06:21.904
MAYBE HAVING SOMEONE OF A THIRD

03:06:21.970 --> 03:06:23.805
PARTY SAY WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE

03:06:23.872 --> 03:06:25.774
QUESTIONS WE'RE LOOKING AT. HOW

03:06:25.841 --> 03:06:27.276
WE'RE GOING TO QUESTION THE

03:06:27.342 --> 03:06:28.977
OFFICER THE DEPUTY INVOLVED IN

03:06:29.044 --> 03:06:30.379
THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT

03:06:30.445 --> 03:06:31.647
THEREFORE IT GIVES THEM THE

03:06:31.713 --> 03:06:33.815
PEOPLE. WHO ARE WATCHING THE

03:06:33.882 --> 03:06:36.084
INVESTIGATION AND IDEA THAT IT'S

03:06:36.151 --> 03:06:37.853
NOT JUST ALL DONE INTERNALLY AND

03:06:37.920 --> 03:06:39.955
AFTERWARDS THERE'S NO WAY FOR US

03:06:40.022 --> 03:06:43.225
TO REALLY- SKIRT THE ISSUE OR

03:06:43.292 --> 03:06:44.993
MINIMIZE. WHAT WHAT THE

03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:46.461
ALLEGATIONS WERE BECAUSE THEY

03:06:46.528 --> 03:06:48.163
WERE LOOKED AT BY LIKE THE

03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:50.065
CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING PART OF

03:06:50.132 --> 03:06:51.466
THE ORGANIZATION SO I THINK THAT

03:06:51.533 --> 03:06:57.472
SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW MAYBE.

03:06:57.539 --> 03:06:58.106
IS WORTHY OF DISCUSSION AT SOME

03:06:58.173 --> 03:07:01.243
POINT. LIMIT SURE SO- LIMITED

03:07:01.310 --> 03:07:02.644
CLARIFY SO IT SHOULD I SHOULD

03:07:02.711 --> 03:07:03.979
THE BE MORE OF A CONCERN.

03:07:04.046 --> 03:07:06.548
PROTOCOL AS TO WHAT QUESTIONS

03:07:06.615 --> 03:07:10.786
SHOULD BE ASKED. THAT HAVE

03:07:10.852 --> 03:07:16.992
ALREADY BEEN EVALUATED. ANYONE

03:07:17.059 --> 03:07:18.894
WITH IT EIGHT I THINK IT WOULD

03:07:18.961 --> 03:07:21.530
BE REALLY DIFFICULT- I MEAN THIS

03:07:21.597 --> 03:07:22.064
REALLY WOULD BE FROM THE

03:07:22.130 --> 03:07:24.032
MANAGEMENT SIDE AND NOT MY

03:07:24.099 --> 03:07:26.301
BAILIWICK BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY

03:07:26.368 --> 03:07:28.236
DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH A

03:07:28.303 --> 03:07:29.705
STANDARD SET OF QUESTIONS

03:07:29.771 --> 03:07:31.239
BECAUSE THE COMPLAINTS ARE SO

03:07:31.306 --> 03:07:32.541
VARIED IN NATURE IN THERE SO

03:07:32.608 --> 03:07:34.643
FACT SPECIFIC THAT THEY YOU KNOW

03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:35.844
I MEAN THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

03:07:35.911 --> 03:07:37.379
THAT- YOU KNOW LIKE MOST

03:07:37.446 --> 03:07:39.214
AGENCIES WILL ASK AT THE END OF

03:07:39.281 --> 03:07:41.016
THE- INVESTIGATION ALL OF THE

03:07:41.083 --> 03:07:42.985
OFFICERS LOOK AT THE POLICIES

03:07:43.051 --> 03:07:43.485
THAT ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE

03:07:43.552 --> 03:07:45.220
VIOLATED. ASKING IF THEY

03:07:45.287 --> 03:07:47.322
VIOLATED IT- YOU KNOW AND IF NOT

03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:49.691
WHY A LOT OF TIMES IN WAYS THAT

03:07:49.758 --> 03:07:52.294
I DON'T APPRECIATE IT OR OR OR

03:07:52.361 --> 03:07:53.328
LIKE THAT THE FORMATTING OF THE

03:07:53.395 --> 03:07:55.130
QUESTIONS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

03:07:55.197 --> 03:07:57.399
LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE YOU YOU CAN'T

03:07:57.466 --> 03:07:59.534
I DON'T THINK MAKE JUST DIED A

03:07:59.601 --> 03:08:01.169
CHECKLIST OF. ALL OF THE

03:08:01.236 --> 03:08:02.938
QUESTIONS OTHER THAN JUST THE

03:08:03.005 --> 03:08:04.506
SORT OF INTRODUCTORY ONCE AT THE

03:08:04.573 --> 03:08:05.841
BEGINNING BECAUSE IT ALL TURNS

03:08:05.907 --> 03:08:07.275
ON WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE

03:08:07.342 --> 03:08:11.113
COMPLAINT AGAINST THE OFFICER.

03:08:11.179 --> 03:08:12.114
WHAT'S THE FACTUAL BACKDROP. IT

03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:13.482
AND I WOULD TO THAT WHAT'S THE

03:08:13.548 --> 03:08:15.050
RISK. OF THE- OR THE WEIGHT WHO

03:08:15.117 --> 03:08:17.319
IS ASKED QUESTIONS THAT THE CAN

03:08:17.386 --> 03:08:20.589
. WHERE THE LEAD. GEISHA NEEDS

03:08:20.656 --> 03:08:23.225
TO GO OR NOT. ALSO DISTRACT THE

03:08:23.291 --> 03:08:25.460
CHIEF MEMBERS COMMON- ABOUT THE

03:08:25.527 --> 03:08:28.830
PARTY- I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

03:08:28.897 --> 03:08:30.666
THAT BUT I THINK WHAT HE- AND

03:08:30.732 --> 03:08:31.566
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG CHIEF

03:08:31.633 --> 03:08:33.201
BUT- WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE

03:08:33.268 --> 03:08:35.070
SEEKING THE ADVICE IF YOU WELL

03:08:35.137 --> 03:08:36.538
ABOVE CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING

THIRD PARTY STATE. EVALUATE THE

QUESTIONS BEING PUBLISHED. I

03:08:48.583 --> 03:08:49.918
THINK MOST AGENCIES PARTICULARLY

03:08:49.985 --> 03:08:52.721
WITH HIGHER LEVEL MORE SERIOUS

03:08:52.788 --> 03:08:54.222
ALLEGATIONS THEY DO BRING IN

03:08:54.289 --> 03:08:56.324
LAWYERS WHETHER YOU CALLING

I SAID BEFORE I DON'T THINK IT

03:11:53.201 --> 03:11:55.070
POSES A PROBLEM I THINK WHERE

03:11:55.136 --> 03:11:56.338
LIKE MISTER SHELDON'S TALKING

03:11:56.404 --> 03:11:57.439

BUSY- LOT IRONS IN THE FIRE BUT

03:12:22.063 --> 03:12:23.265

THE DOMESTICATION IS COMPLETED.

03:12:25.467 --> 03:12:26.668

YOU KNOW IT'S BARELY THERE BUT I

03:13:01.102 --> 03:13:03.104
DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. BECAUSE

AT LEAST FOR THE- LAST MEETING

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:07.542

DOES THAT INFORMATION STAYS ON

03:13:20.455 --> 03:13:23.158
THE OFFICER'S RECORD IF SO WHAT

03:13:23.224 --> 03:13:29.030
IS THE EXTENT. ON ALL I'LL TAKE

03:13:29.097 --> 03:13:32.033
A STAB AT THAT ONE- THE ANSWER

03:13:32.100 --> 03:13:35.303
IS YES DOES- IF AN OFFICER IF

03:13:35.370 --> 03:13:37.472
THE FINDINGS ARE SUSTAINED THE

03:13:37.539 --> 03:13:39.841
OFFICER- WILL BECOME A

03:13:39.908 --> 03:13:41.042
CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN

03:13:41.109 --> 03:13:42.410
DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE

03:13:42.477 --> 03:13:45.113
MISCONDUCT- CAN RANGE AGAIN

03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:47.282
FROM- FROM COUNSELING WHICH IS

03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:48.883
NON DISCIPLINARY IN NATURE THAT

03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:52.487
THAT PROBABLY- IS TEMPORARY

03:13:52.554 --> 03:13:53.355
ANYTHING IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S

03:13:53.421 --> 03:13:55.323
RECORD- BUT ANYTHING THAT IS

03:13:55.390 --> 03:13:56.524
CONSIDERED FORMAL DISCIPLINE

03:13:56.591 --> 03:13:58.293
WHICH WE WHICH MADE. WHICH WOULD

03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:03.231
BE A WRITTEN REPRIMAND. ASSIST

03:14:03.298 --> 03:14:05.433
AND DEMOTION OUR NATION OF

03:14:05.500 --> 03:14:06.501
EMPLOYMENT THOSE ARE THE

03:14:06.568 --> 03:14:08.203
GENERALLY SPEAKING THE MORE

03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:10.271
SIGNIFICANT DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

03:14:10.338 --> 03:14:11.239
THOSE ARE GONNA STAY ON THE

03:14:11.306 --> 03:14:14.275
OFFICER'S RECORD- THERE ARE AT

03:14:14.342 --> 03:14:17.312
PRESENT. AGENCIES THROUGH THE

03:14:17.379 --> 03:14:18.913
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS

03:14:18.980 --> 03:14:21.349
THAT A PERMANENT. URGING OF

03:14:21.416 --> 03:14:24.352
OFFICERS FILES AFTER FIVE YEARS-

03:14:24.419 --> 03:14:27.655
AND SO SOME OF THOSE LATE OLDER

03:14:27.722 --> 03:14:29.057
DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS COULD

03:14:29.124 --> 03:14:30.191
THEORETICALLY BE REMOVED FROM

03:14:30.258 --> 03:14:33.528
THE OFFICERS FILE- THAT WILL BE

03:14:33.595 --> 03:14:36.564
CHANGING AT LEAST WITH SB

03:14:36.631 --> 03:14:37.665
SIXTEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:14:37.732 --> 03:14:41.069
ANY SUSTAINED- FINDING NOW NEEDS

03:14:41.136 --> 03:14:42.370
TO BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM OF

03:14:42.437 --> 03:14:46.708
FIFTEEN YEARS- GOING FORWARD SO-

03:14:46.775 --> 03:14:47.509

GONNA BE KEPT AT LEAST FIFTEEN

03:14:49.644 --> 03:14:50.712
YEARS AND THE LEGISLATURE

CALL- FORCES AGAINST THE STATE

03:14:55.316 --> 03:14:57.519
FINDINGS. NON SYSTEM FINDINGS I

03:14:57.585 --> 03:14:59.087
BELIEVE THOSE RECORDS ARE

03:14:59.154 --> 03:15:00.989
MANDATED TO BE KEPT FIVE YEARS

03:15:01.056 --> 03:15:04.359
SO- I THINK WHAT THIS

03:15:04.426 --> 03:15:06.261
EFFECTIVELY MEANS THOSE THOSE MO

03:15:06.327 --> 03:15:08.129
YOU PROVISIONS THAT DID A LOT

03:15:08.196 --> 03:15:09.764
FOR THE PURGING OF FILES WILL NO

03:15:09.831 --> 03:15:13.334
LONGER BE PERMISSIBLE- GIVEN THE

03:15:13.401 --> 03:15:15.103

THE TIME WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC

03:15:29.017 --> 03:15:30.685
COMMENT BUT I. MUST ASK YOU A

03:15:30.752 --> 03:15:33.321
QUESTION WHAT DO YOU SEE AS IT

03:15:33.388 --> 03:15:37.092
RELATES TO POMOR WOULD YOU SAID

03:15:37.158 --> 03:15:39.994

03:15:40.061 --> 03:15:44.432
AMENDMENTS- WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS

03:15:44.499 --> 03:15:46.201
IN THAT IN THAT SPACE. FROM YOUR

03:15:46.267 --> 03:15:48.236
PERSPECTIVE AS A PROFESSOR AT

03:15:48.303 --> 03:15:52.006
THE UNIVERSITY. AT SURE I THINK

03:15:52.073 --> 03:15:53.308
YOU KNOW THINKS THAT AT THE

03:15:53.374 --> 03:15:54.742
BEGINNING YEAH BY AND LARGE IT'S

03:15:54.809 --> 03:15:56.478
A FAIRLY SENSIBLE SIDE OF

03:15:56.544 --> 03:15:57.745
PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS FOR

03:15:57.812 --> 03:15:58.913
OFFICERS AT BUT I DO THINK

03:15:58.980 --> 03:16:00.915
THERE'S PROBABLY ROOM FOR

03:16:00.982 --> 03:16:02.250
TWEAKING SO ONE THING THAT A

03:16:02.317 --> 03:16:02.784
NUMBER OF STATES INCLUDING

03:16:02.851 --> 03:16:04.385
ILLINOIS ANTON IS MADE MUCH

03:16:04.452 --> 03:16:06.321
CLEAR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

03:16:06.387 --> 03:16:08.089
FORMAL INVESTIGATION AND

03:16:08.156 --> 03:16:10.558
SUPERVISOR. USE THAT YOU KNOW

03:16:10.625 --> 03:16:12.660
THOSE EARLY KIND OF FACT FINDING

03:16:12.727 --> 03:16:15.163
ASK QUESTIONS A SUPERVISORS ASK

03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:16.865
DON'T GET WRAPPED UP INTO A BAR

03:16:16.931 --> 03:16:20.001
PROCESS. THERE'S ALSO BEEN

03:16:20.068 --> 03:16:21.136
DISCUSSING RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW

03:16:21.202 --> 03:16:22.270
REASONABLE QUESTIONS AROUND THE

03:16:22.337 --> 03:16:24.339
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS I

03:16:24.405 --> 03:16:25.740
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OLD

03:16:25.807 --> 03:16:27.208
DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE APPEALABLE

03:16:27.275 --> 03:16:30.011
WATER NUMBER OF STATES LIMIT YOU

03:16:30.078 --> 03:16:32.447
KNOW DISCIPLINE OUT. THIRTY DAYS

03:16:32.514 --> 03:16:34.182
OR MORE SUSPENSIONS OF TALENT ON

03:16:34.249 --> 03:16:36.050
THE WAR ARE AT YOUR BILL AND ALL

03:16:36.117 --> 03:16:39.187
OTHER THINGS ARE DEALT WITH IN A

03:16:39.254 --> 03:16:41.656
SOMEWHAT MORE FORMAL FASHION SO

03:16:41.723 --> 03:16:42.957
I THINK THERE'S ROOM CHECK TWEAK

03:16:43.024 --> 03:16:44.559
AND I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE

03:16:44.626 --> 03:16:46.027
TO DO THAT BUT AGAIN I WOULD

03:16:46.094 --> 03:16:47.395
ALSO URGE THAT TO THE EXTENT

03:16:47.462 --> 03:16:49.397
THAT YOU DO TWEAK ACT I WOULD BE

SAME PROVISIONS DON'T JUST

03:16:56.271 --> 03:16:57.005
REAPPEARING COLLECTIVE

03:16:57.071 --> 03:16:59.440

LOT OF THE SAME RESTRICTIONS

03:17:02.277 --> 03:17:04.712
SOMETIMES MUCH STRICTER ONES-

03:17:04.779 --> 03:17:06.915
THEY GET NEGOTIATED AWAY AND END

03:17:06.981 --> 03:17:08.616
UP BEING JUST AS MUCH OF AN

03:17:08.683 --> 03:17:09.250

DON'T THINK THE BABY TO BE

03:17:25.967 --> 03:17:28.503
THROWN OUT. THERE CAN BE SOME

03:17:28.570 --> 03:17:31.005
TWEAKING AROUND THE GRAY AREA

03:17:31.072 --> 03:17:32.507
ABOUT THAT- THAT PRE

03:17:32.574 --> 03:17:34.209
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATION

03:17:34.275 --> 03:17:35.910
STAGE I THINK CLARITY THERE IS

03:17:35.977 --> 03:17:39.681
WE NEEDED- IT'S FINE IF YOU

03:17:39.747 --> 03:17:40.848
DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE ONE

03:17:40.915 --> 03:17:42.250
YEAR STATURE LIMITATIONS THAT

03:17:42.317 --> 03:17:44.052

OFFICERS HAD YOU WANT TO GIVE

03:17:48.756 --> 03:17:50.425
THE DEPARTMENT MOTIVATION TO

03:17:50.491 --> 03:17:53.027
COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION BUT-

03:17:53.094 --> 03:17:54.596
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE CLEAR WHEN

03:17:54.662 --> 03:17:56.531
THAT CLOCK STARTS RUNNING AND I

03:17:56.598 --> 03:18:01.202
THINK- GIVING US SOME CLARITY ON

03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:03.104
THAT. WOULD BE- WELCOME ALSO

03:18:03.171 --> 03:18:04.939
HAVE I THINK BETWEEN THE REMEDY

03:18:05.006 --> 03:18:06.808
PROVISION OF PULP ARE A SHOULD

03:18:06.874 --> 03:18:07.709
BE ADDRESSED AT SOME LEVEL

03:18:07.775 --> 03:18:09.177
ABOUT. KNOW WHAT IS THE

03:18:09.244 --> 03:18:10.712
APPROPRIATE REMEDY WHEN THEY'RE

03:18:10.778 --> 03:18:12.347
USING A VIOLATION OF THE POOL

03:18:12.413 --> 03:18:14.682
BAR- IN ALL CASES SHOULD

03:18:14.749 --> 03:18:15.950
EVIDENCE BE SUPPRESSED OR

03:18:16.017 --> 03:18:18.119
DISCIPLINE OVERTURNED BECAUSE

03:18:18.186 --> 03:18:19.220
THERE'S BEEN A MINOR TECHNICAL

03:18:19.287 --> 03:18:21.656
VIOLATION OF THE ACT- I THINK

03:18:21.723 --> 03:18:23.758
THIS I THINK INTENT MATTERS. OR

03:18:23.825 --> 03:18:26.628
SHOULD MATTER. AND THAT'S

03:18:26.694 --> 03:18:29.163
SOMETHING I THINK- TO THE EXTENT

03:18:29.230 --> 03:18:30.064
THE COMMITTEE'S GONNA LOOK AT

03:18:30.131 --> 03:18:32.600
THINGS ABOUT TWEAKING- THE ACT

03:18:32.667 --> 03:18:34.569

IF YOU ARE TO MAKE CHANGES YOU

03:18:43.544 --> 03:18:45.313
DO ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THE

03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:46.514
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUTES

03:18:46.581 --> 03:18:49.217
AS WELL SO. THERE CAN'T BE AN

03:18:49.284 --> 03:18:52.987
INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES WHO JUST

03:18:53.054 --> 03:18:54.555
CONTRACT AROUND WHAT THE LIFE IS

03:18:54.622 --> 03:18:55.823

THAT I'LL DO THE SAME FOR MR MR

03:19:01.863 --> 03:19:04.198
ACNE AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO

03:19:04.265 --> 03:19:05.967
THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION. OF

03:19:06.034 --> 03:19:10.004
THE AGENDA- JUST VERY BRIEFLY

03:19:10.071 --> 03:19:11.739
CONCERNING THE- THE STATUTE OF

03:19:11.806 --> 03:19:13.007
LIMITATIONS I CERTAINLY WOULD

03:19:13.074 --> 03:19:17.445
NOT. CONSIDER SHORTENING HAD-

03:19:17.512 --> 03:19:18.379
ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN TELL YOU

03:19:18.446 --> 03:19:20.481
IS THAT THERE IS A MOTIVATION TO

03:19:20.548 --> 03:19:22.050
DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS OF

03:19:22.116 --> 03:19:24.185
WITHIN A TIMELY MANNER NOW THAT

03:19:24.252 --> 03:19:25.787
WE HAVE THE ONE YEAR STATUTE.

03:19:25.853 --> 03:19:27.155
ARE YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO

03:19:27.221 --> 03:19:28.122
CONSIDERATION THE SIZE OF THE

03:19:28.189 --> 03:19:30.625
ORGANIZATION- MY REALIZATION IS

03:19:30.692 --> 03:19:31.759
A LITTLE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED

03:19:31.826 --> 03:19:34.429
FOLKS SOME AGENCIES ARE LARGEST

03:19:34.495 --> 03:19:36.631
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND- SO YOU HAVE

03:19:36.698 --> 03:19:38.866
NATURALLY MORE MORE EMPLOYEES

03:19:38.933 --> 03:19:40.868
YOU HAVE YOU KNOW MORE CASES

03:19:40.935 --> 03:19:42.170
GOING AND MOST INTERNAL AFFAIRS

03:19:42.236 --> 03:19:44.372
BUREAUS ARE NOT VERY LARGE IN

03:19:44.439 --> 03:19:46.474
SEOUL- THE NUMBER OF CASES-

03:19:46.541 --> 03:19:48.142
THAT. INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO

03:19:48.209 --> 03:19:50.178
HANDLE- JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LIKE

03:19:50.244 --> 03:19:52.480
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS- YOU CAN

03:19:52.547 --> 03:19:53.614
BE OVERWHELMING AND SO YOU WANT

03:19:53.681 --> 03:19:54.349
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

03:19:54.415 --> 03:19:57.185
MANAGEABLE- AND THEN I CONCUR

03:19:57.251 --> 03:19:58.286
WITH YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS OF

03:19:58.353 --> 03:20:01.689

MISUNDERSTANDING. ANY

RECOMMENDATIONS YEAH AS I SAID

03:20:09.230 --> 03:20:10.331
IN MY PRESENTATION MY

03:20:10.398 --> 03:20:13.568
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO

03:20:13.634 --> 03:20:15.703
CODIFY THESE UNION RIGHTS FOR

03:20:15.770 --> 03:20:18.573
ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IMPORTANT-

03:20:18.639 --> 03:20:20.308
EITHER IN THE VARIOUS LABOR

03:20:20.375 --> 03:20:22.443
STATUTES LIKE MYERS MILLER'S

03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:24.712
BROWN BILLS ACTING CETERA- OR

03:20:24.779 --> 03:20:26.180
JUST IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE

03:20:26.247 --> 03:20:27.915
GOVERNMENT CODE I DID WANT TO

03:20:27.982 --> 03:20:30.017
TOUCH JUST ON TWO POINTS THAT

03:20:30.084 --> 03:20:30.885
WERE RAISED BY SOME OF THE OTHER

03:20:30.952 --> 03:20:32.954
SPEAKERS WITH THE RESPECTED DUE

03:20:33.020 --> 03:20:35.256
PROCESS THIS STATUTE DOESN'T

03:20:35.323 --> 03:20:37.959
SPECIFY WHAT GETS APPEALED OR

03:20:38.025 --> 03:20:38.926
ONE THOUSAND GET A FIELD THAT'S

03:20:38.993 --> 03:20:41.229
A MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.

03:20:41.295 --> 03:20:43.131
AND GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO

03:20:43.197 --> 03:20:45.066
SKELLY AND WHAT OUR SUPREME

03:20:45.133 --> 03:20:47.101
COURT SAID IS THAT THE NATURE OF

03:20:47.168 --> 03:20:49.137
THE DEPRIVATION DETERMINES THE

03:20:49.203 --> 03:20:50.671
LEVEL OF DUE PROCESS THAT'S

03:20:50.738 --> 03:20:54.108
REQUIRED SO FOR INSTANCE- YES

03:20:54.175 --> 03:20:55.243
YOU CAN APPEAL A LETTER OF

03:20:55.309 --> 03:20:57.245
REPRIMAND BUT ONLY IF IT SAYS

03:20:57.311 --> 03:20:58.379
IT'S GOING TO BE USED AGAINST

03:20:58.446 --> 03:21:00.381
YOU IN THE FUTURE AND THE APPEAL

03:21:00.448 --> 03:21:01.816
AS A MEETING WITH THE SUPERVISOR

03:21:01.883 --> 03:21:02.984
THAT ISSUE THAT YOU'RE SOMEBODY

03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:04.051
THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

03:21:04.118 --> 03:21:05.052
OVERTURN IT IT'S NOT AN

03:21:05.119 --> 03:21:07.021
EVIDENTIARY HEARING IT'S NOT AS

03:21:07.088 --> 03:21:09.791
EXPENSIVE OR CUMBERSOME PROCESS-

03:21:09.857 --> 03:21:12.427
AS COMPARED TO A TERMINATION OR

03:21:12.493 --> 03:21:13.161
SUSPENSION OR SOMETHING OF THAT

03:21:13.227 --> 03:21:16.230
NATURE- WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:21:16.297 --> 03:21:22.770
REMEDY. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. WITH MR SHELDON ON SOME POINTS

03:21:22.837 --> 03:21:24.038
. ONE UNDER THIS. IT DOES SAYS

03:21:24.105 --> 03:21:25.440
THAT THE COURT CAN FASHION A

03:21:25.506 --> 03:21:27.475
REMEDY BUT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC.

03:21:27.542 --> 03:21:29.477
OTHER BILL OF RIGHTS AND OTHER

03:21:29.544 --> 03:21:31.979
STATES IT IS AUTOMATIC THAT IF

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:35.683
YOU COMMIT A VIOLATION- THEN. X.

03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:37.518
HAPPENS TO CASES THROWN OUT OR

03:21:37.585 --> 03:21:39.520
EVIDENCE IS SUPPRESSED. I HAVE

03:21:39.587 --> 03:21:41.389
NOT SEEN A CASE THROWN OUT

03:21:41.456 --> 03:21:43.858
BECAUSE- OF A PROCEDURAL

03:21:43.925 --> 03:21:47.428
VIOLATION TYPICALLY WHAT DAY THE

03:21:47.495 --> 03:21:49.764
COURTS WILL DO. IS I THINK

03:21:49.831 --> 03:21:51.532
LOBBY- WAS- ONE OF THE SEMINAL

03:21:51.599 --> 03:21:53.901
CASES ON THIS THEY APPLIED FOR A

03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.136
MIDDLE TYPE STANDARD LIKE IF

03:21:55.203 --> 03:21:57.371
YOU. INTERROGATED SOMEBODY

03:21:57.438 --> 03:21:58.673
WITHOUT ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE A

03:21:58.739 --> 03:22:00.308
WRAP YOU CAN'T USE THAT

03:22:00.374 --> 03:22:02.009
INTERROGATION AGAINST THEM BUT

03:22:02.076 --> 03:22:04.111
YOU CAN READ NOTICE ON AND GIVE

03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:06.414
THEM A PROPER INTERROGATION-

03:22:06.481 --> 03:22:08.115
WITH THE RAP AND YOU CAN STILL

03:22:08.182 --> 03:22:09.484
DISCIPLINE I'M AND I'VE HAD

03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:10.985
CASES WHERE THAT'S HAPPENED IN

03:22:11.052 --> 03:22:13.120
THAT. STATE MINISTER ON HOW BUT

03:22:13.187 --> 03:22:14.489
THE NETWORK SAYS THAT'S ALL THAT

03:22:14.555 --> 03:22:16.190
HAPPENS THE COURT HAS BROAD

03:22:16.257 --> 03:22:17.225
DISCRETION BUT THEY WILL

03:22:17.291 --> 03:22:18.926
TYPICALLY SAY THAT'S ALL THAT

03:22:18.993 --> 03:22:20.428
HAPPENS YOU CAN PROCEED WITH THE

03:22:20.495 --> 03:22:22.263
CASE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT

03:22:22.330 --> 03:22:24.432
YOU HAVE EXCEPT FOR. THE ILL

03:22:24.499 --> 03:22:26.367
GOTTEN STATEMENT- WHICH

03:22:26.434 --> 03:22:27.635
TYPICALLY IT'S NOT MUCH OF A

03:22:27.702 --> 03:22:29.504
REMEDY TO MY CLIENTS IT'S REALLY

03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:32.240
MORE JUST- HOLDING THE AGENCIES

03:22:32.306 --> 03:22:34.041
FEET TO THE FIRE. BECAUSE THEY

03:22:34.108 --> 03:22:36.444
CAN GO RE INTERVIEWED THEM. AND

03:22:36.511 --> 03:22:37.645
TO GET THOSE STATEMENTS AND

03:22:37.712 --> 03:22:39.380
THERE HAVE BEEN COURT CASES

03:22:39.447 --> 03:22:40.381
WHERE THE COURTS HAVE COME DOWN

03:22:40.448 --> 03:22:41.482
AND SAID THAT THERE WAS A

03:22:41.549 --> 03:22:45.152
VIOLATION. OF OUR POP ARCS AND

03:22:45.219 --> 03:22:46.621
TOLD THE AGENCY YOU KNOW

03:22:46.687 --> 03:22:48.289
ESSENTIALLY DON'T DO THIS AGAIN

03:22:48.356 --> 03:22:50.691
AND GIVE THEM A WARNING BUT THEN

03:22:50.758 --> 03:22:52.793
SAID THAT BASED ON THE THINGS

03:22:52.860 --> 03:22:54.529
MISTER SHELDON WAS TALKING ABOUT

03:22:54.595 --> 03:22:55.863
YOU KNOW THE INTENT AND WAS THAT

03:22:55.930 --> 03:22:57.164
A MISTAKE IN AND ALL OF THOSE

03:22:57.231 --> 03:22:59.667
FACTORS. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

03:22:59.734 --> 03:23:02.770
PROVIDE- I RECOURSE OR REMEDY

03:23:02.837 --> 03:23:04.505
BEYOND JUST TELLING TE AGENCY.

03:23:04.572 --> 03:23:07.041
NOT TO DO IT AGAIN- SO JUST IN

03:23:07.108 --> 03:23:09.176
CONCLUSION I THINK THAT THESE

03:23:09.243 --> 03:23:12.613
ARE SIMPLE. CARE BASIC FAIRNESS

03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:14.448
AND BASIC DUE PROCESS RIGHTS

03:23:14.515 --> 03:23:16.350
