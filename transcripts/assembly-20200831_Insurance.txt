WORK SHARING INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WORKERS THAT ARE EMPLOYED AND IF I REDUCES THE COST OF LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT WORK SHARING ALSO HELPS MAINTAINING ATTACHMENT BETWEEN WORKERS AND FIRMS AND THIS PREVENTS WORKERS FROM LOSING ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A KEY FACTOR IN THE COST OF UNEMPLOYMENT. AND MOBILE UNDER WORK SHARING WORKERS KEEP RECEIVING HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS THAT PUT THEM IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN TEMPORARY LAYOFFS EMPLOYERS BENEFIT AS WELL ESPECIALLY IN THIS PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY COULD REHIRE LAID OFF WORKER ON A PART TIME YOU CAN WORKSHOPS AND FINALLY. BY LIMITING ONGOING LAYOFFS WORK SHARING ALSO ALLOWS FOR A FASTER RECOVERY BY REDUCING CROWDING IN THE LABOR MARKET AND WE'RE TRYING HAS FOR THIS REASON BOB BY SUPPORT.

AND ALL INVITE MISS GONZALEZ TO PRESENT HER BILL. THIS WAS A GUT AND AMEND FROM THE SENATE. COMING TO US FROM THE SENATE MISTER CALDERON HAD TO LEAVE AND HE MAY NOT BE BACK FOR A WHILE SO ALASKA MARC TO REMIND ME TO HOLD A HEARING OPEN BECAUSE HE DOES WANT TO ADD ON. WILL GROW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD IT'S A GOT A MENU MADE THAT SOUND SO DIRTY AND OUT OF ORDINARY I SHALL WRITE OR PRONOUNCE IT DIFFERENTLY NEXT TIME. THE GUT AND AMEND THANK YOU. IT'S A GREAT. LOOK AT A NASHVILLE- IT DID GO THROUGH THE SENATE. BUT AT ASSEMBLY BILL TEN SIXTY SIX IS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE INDIVIDUAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS ARE NOT DELAYED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYER HASN'T RESPONDED TO ET'S INITIAL NOTICES. IT ALSO ALLOWS ET DE TO DELEGATE THEIR AUTHORITY TO RECOVER MISSING YOU I CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AG FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE. THAT HAVE WORKERS RECEIVING STATEWIDE BUT HAVE NEVER PAID INTO THE FUND. THE EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM HAS BEEN A CRITICAL LIFELINE WE KNOW DURING THESE TIMES MANY WORKERS EVERY DAY WAIT TO GET THROUGH EDT FOR THE U. I. BENEFITS. IN EVERY DAY THEY HAVE TO WAIT IS A DAY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO PAY THE RENT OR BUY FOOD. WE'VE HEARD IN OUR OFFICES THE DELAY IS OUTSTANDING. BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES STREAMLINE SOME OF THAT SO HOPEFULLY DELETE SOME OF THOSE DELAYS IT CODIFIES THE TEN DAY DEADLINE FOR EMPLOYERS TO RESPOND TO ET'S INITIAL NOTICE. UNLESS THERE IS A GOOD CAUSE FOR THAT DELAY THIS IS. ALTHOUGH A NEW DEADLINE ALREADY IN THE LITERATURE THAT IS SENT TO EMPLOYERS THEY HAVE A TEN DAY RESPONSE- REQUIREMENT IN THE LITERATURE THAT THEY SENT. ASSEMBLY INSURERS AND INDIVIDUALS CLAIM WILL NOT BE DELAYED IT JUST BECAUSE EMPLOYER HAS NOT RESPONDED TO ET'S INITIAL REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION AB TEN SIXTY SIX WOULD ALLOW EACH DELEGATE THEIR AUTHORITY TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO RECOVER MISSING YOU I CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AND TAXPAYERS ARE SUBSIDIZING COMPANIES ARE BREAKING THE LAW BY NOT PAYING INTO YOU I FIND WELL THERE WORKERS RECEIVE YOU I BENEFITS. WHAT WE SAW DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION IS IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO PAY OFF FOR YOU I DEBT WE KNOWTHAT IN TWO YEARS WE HAVE A FEDERAL LOAN THAT'S GOING TO BECOME DEAL. AND THAT THAT WILL HAVE TO BE PAID BY LAW ABIDING BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING IN WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING AFTER THE COMPANIES WHO HAVE NOT PAID IN AND TO RELEASE. SOME OF THAT BURDEN SPECIALLY OFF OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT. IT'S TIME WHEN ARE YOU AYE. FUND IS BEING DEPLETED AB TEN SIXTY SIX ONE SURE CORPORATIONS THEIR FAIR. INSURE THAT WORK GET THEIR THEIR BETTER. IN A TIMELY MANNER AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR TIME BUT- ALL RIGHT- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE INVITE PUBLIC COMMENT ANY QUESTIONS THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED I WILL ASK THE EIGHTEEN T. MODERATOR TO INVITE SUPPORT COMMENT. GIVEN THE POOR COMING YOU MAY PRESS. ONE ZERO. ONE MOMENT WHILE WE GET THE PHONE LINE NUMBER. YOU AND WE WILL GO TO A LINE OF NINETY ONE. NINETY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERAPH LOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISS FLOCKS. OTHER OTHER SUPPORT. COMMENTS THANK YOU. IT IS ONE ZERO FOR SUPPORT. THERE ARE NO WHEN Q. THANK YOU- WOULD YOU INVITE ANY OPPOSE COMMENTS PLEASE. MODERATOR IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU'RE NOT THE VISION OF THIS BILL YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO NOW. A MEASURE TO WELL- WHICH COMPANY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I'D LIKE TO SPEAK I THE PRINCIPLE I PROMISE TO BE QUICK. GO AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU GET RIGHT WHICH REPUBLICAN CONGRESS YOUR POST BABY CAN'T BE SICK- IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT BILL WILL RESOLVE THE PROBLEM CITED THAT MAY CREATE NEW ONES- I APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF THE AUTHOR AND ALL I WILLATTEMPT TO MIRROR IT AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ABOUT A GOOD BET YOU GOT HIM. HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL BASICALLY IT IS POINTING IN THE RIGHT BECAUSE WRECK NO EVIDENT IN PLAYERS FAILING DELAYING AND IN PROVIDING FORM CD ALREADY HAVE IT THAT HAVE CAUSED YOU TO BE SLOW WE'RE AWARE OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID WHICH IS EASY IT'S BEEN OVER WELL. TO THAT END WE DON'T SEE THE TEN DAY DEADLINE AND THE BILL HAS CREATING ANY IMPROVEMENT IN FACT EXISTING ET REGULATIONS ALREADY DEFINED DEADLINES FOR EACH FORM IN A VERY PRECISE MANNER AND ALREADY CARRIED A PUNISHMENT IF YOU FAILED TO RESPOND YOU WILL PAY MORE BENEFITS SO THAT ALREADY IN TAX WE'RE CONSERVATIVE BILL ADDS A LAYER OF VAGUENESS THAT THAT MAY ACTUALLY. MAKE THE PROFIT NOT WORK AS WELL ADMITTEDLY IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT IT WILL ONLY MAKE. IT MORE COMPLICATED. ONE MORE GRIEF FOR AT FORMS EVEN URGENT. NOW TO WEAR. RIGHT AT THE END. OF A ONE FORM EXAMPLE. IS A- AND TO READ. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO CONTEST BENEFITS SO. IF YOU. TO RESPOND TO I THINK POINT AROUND. THAT THE COURT RECORDS OR THE BACON SO I WILL STOP THEIR- AND- RESPECT THEY POSE A BECAUSE THE KEYS. THANK YOU MISTER RUIZ. OUR OTHER PERSONS WERE TO A. KEEP IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO. THERE IS NO OTHER ONE THANK YOU. ALRIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBERS ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OR MAKE COMMENTS. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER IF YOU'D LIKE TO THANK YOU KANYA I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND THERE'S FRUSTRATION BY EVERYBODY BUT WE KNOW FROM DOING CASE WORK THAT OF BUSINESSES FAILURE TO RESPOND ESPECIALLY WITH MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS HAS IN FACT LED TO DENIAL OF BENEFIT OR PROLONGED- INVESTIGATION AND A WAIT PERIOD. FOR EMPLOYEES THAT NEED THOSE FUNDS THIS WILL PUT A TIME CERTAIN DATE WHEN THE EDT WILL STOP WAITING FOR AN EMPLOYER TO RESPOND INSTEAD START THE INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER NUMBER ONE THEIR EMPLOYEE AND HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MADE IT WON'T JUST BE A FREE PASS TO. TO IT TO PAY OUT FUNDS BUT IT ALLOWS ET DE TO SAY ALRIGHT WE'VE GIVEN THEM TIME WE'VE GOT TO MOVE ON THAT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN FACT I HAVE IN MY DISTRICT A WOMAN WHO DIED- BECAUSE SHE WENT BACK TO WORK BECAUSE HURT HER FORM WAS NEVER FILLED OUT IT WAS NEVER RETURNED- SHOULD WAITED THREE MONTHS. FOR ET DE TO DECIDE TO BEGIN THE WAGE INVESTIGATION SHE WAS MISCLASSIFIED I'M XIN OF CONTRACTING COBIT AND DINE AND SO LOOK WE HEAR THE STORIES I KNOW ALL OF YOU HAVE HEARD THE STORIES THIS JUST SETS A TIMELINE IT SETS A TIMELINE SO THAT HE CAN TELL US THEY'RE JUST WAITING IT ALSO ALLOWS- I AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A FEW YEARS WE'RE ALL GOING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE NOT PAID INTO. THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND AS A RESULT IT'S UNDERFUNDED WE KNOW FOR A FACT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT- THAT FIND OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT WE BORROWED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S GOING TO BECOME DEAL AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO OUR MOM AND POP SHOPS IN OUR DISTRICT WHY THEY'RE PAYING FOR CORPORATIONS WHO NEVER PAID AND THIS ALLOWS EIGHTY TO GO AFTER THOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR TIME.
