UPDATE TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:44.629
PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.698
MAKE IT A REALLY A FUNCTIONAL.

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:48.200
A BILL AND ABLE TO GET THE

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:49.401
INFORMATION TO BUILDING OWNERS

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:50.368
THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE

00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:51.570
INVESTMENT.

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:53.405
DECISIONS AND ALSO FINANCE

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:55.073
INVESTMENTS.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.408
I'M SO AB EIGHT A THREE TO

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:57.809

MULTI FAMILY BUILDING OWNERS

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:03.281
ACCESS TO HOLD BUILDING DATA

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:04.616
AGAIN SO THEY CAN MAKE THE

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.351
SENSIBLE INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:08.253
THERE'S THREE WAYS AT THIS BILL

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.222
IS GOING TO CLEAN UP ON NATO TO

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:11.823
SO THAT ITS REALLY USABLE --

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.258
THE FIRST IS THAT THERE IS SOME

00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:14.893
LANGUAGE ISSUES AROUND THE USE

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.961
OF THE TERM A BUILDING AS

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:17.629
OPPOSED TO PROPERTY.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.064
AND WE USE THE TERM THAT BILL

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:20.432
USES THE TERM BUILDING AND IN

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:22.234
FACT THERE'S A NUMBER OF A MULTI

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.702
FAMILY PROPERTIES THAT HAVE

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:24.603
SMALL GARDEN APARTMENTS IN THE

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:26.004
CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:27.105
AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.039
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:29.374
AYE MULTI FAMILY PROPERTIES ARE

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.376
ABLE TO BE AGGREGATED AND THOSE

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:32.911
PROPERTIES CAN RECEIVE.

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:34.246
ENERGY EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.480
AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:37.215
IMPACTS OF THE CURRENT ENERGY

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:39.117
USE IN THE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:41.086
MADE TO MAKE THOSE ON UNITS MORE

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:41.787
EFFICIENT.

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:43.588
I'M SECOND AB IT ARE TWO DID NOT

00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:44.856
REQUIRE THE CC TO ESTABLISH A

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.291
BUILDING IDENTIFIER FOR EACH

00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:47.225
BUILDING.

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.161
ON THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:51.296
VENN NUMBER I'M FOR VEHICLE SO

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:52.998
THAT THOSE LARGER PROPERTIES

00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:54.065
THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PUBLICLY

00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:56.401
BENCHMARK THEIR DATA ENERGY USE.

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:57.235
CAN -- MAKE

00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:57.869
SURE THAT THAT THE MEET THE ALL

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.873
THE DIFFERENT.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.341
IT MAY SEEM LIKE --

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:04.843
SURPRISING THAT THIS ISN'T THAT

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.211
DISTANCE MORE COMPLICATED THAN

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.345
IT SHOULD BE.

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:08.280
BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:09.714
MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:10.348
BUILDING IN THE STATE WE KNOW

00:24:10.415 --> 00:24:11.516
WHERE THEY ARE AND WE KNOW WHICH

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.051
BILLS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BE

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.119
ASSOCIATED.

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:15.854
WITH THOSE PROPERTIES SO PRETTY --

00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.956
IMPORTANT FACT --

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:24.429
AND THE THE THIRD PIECE --

00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:25.063
BUT THAT'S IT SO DOES BOTH SORT

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.565
OF THE MAIN ISSUES ON WITH THE

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:27.199

COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:25.877
COULD GET WORSE.

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.345
EVEN AS WE MEET OUR GREENHOUSE

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:30.648

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.116
THIS BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:34.385

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:43.828
AN ANALYSIS OF THE AIR QUALITY

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.863
IMPACTS BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.832

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:58.343
DATA THE FIRST PART OF THIS BILL

00:32:58.409 --> 00:32:59.777
REQUIRES THAT A CALIFORNIA

STARTS STOPS AND CYCLING OVER

CONCERNS FROM BALANCING

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:49.060
AUTHORITIES.

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.762
IN THIS NEW LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN

00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:52.630
THE PARALLEL THE U. S. EPA'S

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:54.699
REQUIREMENTS SO THAT EACH OF THE

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:55.733
FACILITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.502
ABOUT CONSENT CARP AND CAN THE

00:33:57.568 --> 00:34:00.505
SEND THE U. S. EPA THE QUARTERLY

00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:01.973
ADMISSION DATA SETS TOGETHER.

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.207
SO THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:04.842
THE ADDRESSES ANALYSIS OF AIR

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:06.544
QUALITY IMPACTS.

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:08.513
AND FIRST I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:10.782
ARM AMENDMENTS WE'VE ADDRESSED

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:11.649
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:13.551
OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS BY TAKING

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.720
OUT PREVIOUS PROVISIONS RELATING

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:16.954
TO PERMIT LIMITATIONS THAT

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.756
IMPACT DISPATCH.

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.091
THAT GOT EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.893
ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:23.461
ADDRESSING THIS DISPATCH IN A

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.496
MEANINGFUL WAY IS IMPORTANT WE

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.498
THINK MORE DATA AND DISCUSSION

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.900
THIS NECESSARY DEFERRED TO

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:30.101
DEVELOP THAT CONCEPT.

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:32.336
NOW OUR ANALYSIS OF YOUR CALL

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:33.704
THE IMPACTS IS NOW LIVE IT IS

00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:35.773
JUST TWO SECTIONS THE FIRST

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.708
SECTION SEE REQUIRES THAT AIR

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.043
DISTRICTS TO DETERMINE THE

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.145
ACTUAL EMISSIONS OF POWER PLANTS

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:42.847
DUE TO THE CYCLING.

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.415
THIS INFORMATION IS AND ISN'T

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:46.083
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARDS

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.752
ASSESSING THIS ISSUE IT WILL BE

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:53.658
USEFUL TO US INFORMATION

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:58.463
[inaudible] TO USE.

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.465
BUT THEN THIS WILL INFORM THIS

00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:02.300
IF THIS FORM FORMER STAR STUDY

00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:04.469
OF THE FLEET AND AND HOW WHAT

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:05.770
THE FINAL SECTION OF THE ABOUT

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.371
BILL IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:08.773
THE OTHER SECTION RELATES TO THE

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.908
ANALYSIS IN SECTION VI WHICH

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.777
REQUIRES AIR DISTRICTS TO LOOK.

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.879
AT THE ACTUAL IMPACT TO LOOK TO

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.414
THE ACTUAL IMPACTS AT YOUR

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:17.849
QUALITY --

00:35:17.915 --> 00:35:19.050
ON THE CHANGING OF CYCLING IN

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:19.517
THAT IN THE DIFFERENT

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.519
COMMUNITIES THIS CONSIDERATION

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:23.554
IS ESSENTIAL AYE FOR ENSURING

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:24.822
THAT THE IMPACTS OF THIS CHANGE

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.524
IN THE CYCLING IS UNDERSTOOD.

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:28.593
THIS BILL DOES NOT THAT EXTEND

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:30.728
THEIR CHANGE CURRENT HERE

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.063
DISTRICT PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS

HE SAID IT AGAIN THIS BILL DOES

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:34.131
NOT.

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.967
DAD CHANGER ALTER CURRENT AIR

PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS RATHER

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:39.270
IT REQUIRES THAT THE YEAR

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:40.872
DISTRICTS.

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.573
BLESSEDLY EVALUATE THIS

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.575
OPERATIONAL CHANGE AS WE ARE

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:46.611
SAYING FARM FORTS IMPACT ON

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:48.813
AMBIENT AIR WITHIN THEIR CURRENT

PERMITTING AUTHORITIES AND

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.650
FINALLY THE STUDY.

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:55.052
HOW THE WE TRANSITION OUR FLEET

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.254
THE BILL THIS BILL REQUIRES A

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.556
STUDY ON HOW TO PRIORITIZE TO

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:00.057
REDUCTION OF THE USAGE AND

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.893
EVENTUAL RETIREMENT OF NATURAL

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:03.794
GAS FACILITIES MOST IMPACTING

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:05.363
THE AIR QUALITY OF DISADVANTAGED

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:06.264
COMMUNITIES?

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.632
AND COMMUNITIES BREATHING

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:09.767
UNHEALTHY AIR THIS STUDY IS NOW

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.068
IN THE THE STATE'S NEEDED RIGHT

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.236
NOW.

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:13.571
GAS PLANTS ARE ALREADY

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:15.039
THREATENING TO RETIRE ACROSS THE

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:17.275
STATE BUT THERE'S NO PLAN ON HOW

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.943
THIS SHOULD OCCUR WITHOUT ANY

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.678
STEADY WE COULD END UP WITH

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:22.079
INCREASE POLLUTION FROM POWER

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.948
PLANTS IN AREAS WITH THE WORST

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.116
AIR QUALITY.

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.517
THIS STUDY WILL GIVE US THE

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:28.052
INFORMATION TO HELP OUR

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:30.821

A GREAT.

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:34.525
NOW.

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:35.059
YOU WILL HEALTHCARE FROM

OPPOSITION.

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.729
I SAID DISCUSSED ARE JUST NOW

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.097
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:42.199
ARGUMENTS BY THE OPPOSITION HAVE

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.067
BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE REMOVAL OF

OPPOSITION CAN BE DIVIDED INTO

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:57.081
TWO ARGUMENTS FIRST THERE'S AN

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:58.916
ARGUMENT OF WHETHER THIS PROBLEM

00:36:58.983 --> 00:36:59.850
SHOULD BE ADDRESS.

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:00.818
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS OF

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:03.721
POWER PLANTS CONTRARY TO WHAT

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.856
THE OPPOSITION STATES WANT POWER

ANY SUGGESTION THAT MINIMIZING

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.065
POWER PLANT EMISSIONS SHOULD NOT

ANALYSIS OF POWER PLANTS SHOWS

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:25.509
THAT EMISSIONS FROM ONE FACILITY

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:26.777
CAN NEARLY DOUBLE THE

WORST CITIES FOR OZONE TAP SEVEN

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.060
OF THE TOP TEN WERE CITIES FOR

YEAR ROUND PARTICULATE POLLUTION

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:26.564
AND SEVEN OF THE TOP TEN WERE

POLLUTED CITIES RIGHT HERE.

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.906
AS WERE BRIEFING TODAY.

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.441
THE SACRAMENTO AREA RANKS FIFTH

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:40.411
WORST IN THE NATION FOR OZONE.

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.346
AND ONE POWER PLANTS EMISSIONS

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.648
CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:46.050
I'M I HAVE AN EXAMPLE FOR YOU

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.284
THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.119
UNFORTUNATELY THROUGHOUT THE

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:49.286
STATE BUT I'M GONNA TALK A

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:50.221
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PINOCHET

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:52.089
ENERGY CENTER WHICH IS LOCATED

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:54.525
IN FRESNO COUNTY.

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:56.260
IT'S AN IN NON ATTAINMENT AREA

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:57.661
WITH SOME OF THE WORST AIR

00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:59.196
QUALITY IN THE STATE AND IN THE

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:00.664
COUNTRY.

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.433
I'M THE AIR DISTRICTS MODELING

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.701
OF PANACHE FOUND THAT IT'S

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.770
NORMAL OPERATING IMPACTS WOULD

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.505
CAUSE LOCAL EMISSIONS. TO

00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:09.573
VIOLATE TWENTY FOUR HOUR

OVER A 100% AND ANNUAL STANDARDS

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.113
BY NEARLY 70%.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.381
THE AIR MODELING ANALYSIS DID

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.617
NOT EVEN CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.986
IMPACT OF START UPS SHUTDOWNS

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:25.289
AND PARTIAL OPERATION.

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.924
AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FRESNO

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:29.193
MADERA AREA IS THE THIRD WORST

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.795
IN THE NATION FOR SHORT TERM

00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:32.329
PARTICLE POLLUTION.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:35.299
SO INTO THIS AREA AT THE AIR

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:37.368
DISTRICT WAS PERMITTING AT POWER

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:38.969
PLANT AND IT DID NOT MODEL START

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.005
UPS OR SHUT DOWNS.

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.473
BUT PINOCHET IS NOW UP AND

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.741
RUNNING AND IT'S STARTING AND

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.176
STOPPING NEARLY EVERYDAY AND

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.677
THIS IS NO EXAGGERATION.

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.479
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EACH OF ITS

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.114
UNITS STARTED MORE THAN THREE

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:52.650
HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES.

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.518
THE START UP EMISSIONS FROM ANY

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:56.120
GAS FIRED POWER PLANT CAN BE

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:57.721
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN STEADY

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.423
STATE EMISSIONS.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.659
I'M ONE OF THE PILLOW SHE UNITS

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.294
HAD AND IT MAKES US OXIDE OR

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.095
KNOCKS RATE OF A HUNDRED AND

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.530
ELEVEN POUNDS PER AND THE TO YOU

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.331
WHEN IT STARTED.

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:09.867
AND A RATE OF EIGHT POUNDS PER

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.602
AND BTU DURING STEADY STATE

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:12.703
OPERATION THIS MEANS THE PLAN

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.872
ACTUAL EMISSIONS ARE OVER TEN

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:16.073
TIMES MORE THAN THE STEADY STATE

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.274
EMISSIONS.

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:18.542
AND THAT'S WHAT THE AIR DISTRICT

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:20.778
WITH MODELING.

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:21.612
OTHER PLANTS EMIT EVEN MORE

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.914
DURING START UP. FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.382
COLUSA GENERATING STATION IS

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.518
PERMITTED TO EMIT AS MUCH KNOCKS

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.019
IN ONE START.

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:31.655
AS IT DOES IN THIRTY EIGHT HOURS

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.390
OF STEADY STATE OPERATION.

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.892
AS CALIFORNIA INTEGRATES MORE

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:36.594
RENEWABLES PLANTS LIKE PANACHE

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.297
WILL BE CYCLED MORE OFTEN.

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:41.465
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.634
NOT PROVIDE A MECHANISM A

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.903
UNIFORM MECHANISM FOR AIR

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:46.804
DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER THESE

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:48.305
CHANGES.

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:49.640
THE DISTRICTS CURRENTLY HAVE A

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:51.008
REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THAT A

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:52.376
PERMIT DOES NOT PREVENT OR

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.144
INTERFERE WITH THE ATTAINMENT OR

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.813
MAINTENANCE OF ANY APPLICABLE

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.781
AIR QUALITY STANDARD.

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:59.683
I'M AN AIR DISTRICTS CAN'T ISSUE

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.885
A PERMIT AND LAST THE PERMIT

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.286
APPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.788
RULES ORDERS REGULATIONS.

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:07.758
I'M BUT THE AIR DISTRICTS SO

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:09.393
WHILE THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.661
REQUIRE LIMITS ON CYCLING IN

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.962
PERMITS.

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:12.830
THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY SEEKING

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.965
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW PLANNED

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.567
OPERATION IS CHANGING TO MEET

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.669
THE NEEDS OF THE GRAD.

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:20.437
IN FACT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:21.405
POWER PLANTS ARE OPERATING ON A

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:23.007
DAY TO DAY BASIS.

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:25.276
IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:26.277
DISTRICTS OR TO THE PUBLIC.

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.544
YOU HAVE ABOUT THIRTY SEC

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:27.845
[inaudible]

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.280
THANK YOU.

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:30.481
PERMITTING REQUIREMENT OF

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:33.183
SECTION DE OF SB SIXTY FOUR IS

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.052
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.387
THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:37.621
REDUNDANT TO WHAT THE AIR

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:38.789
DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY DOING

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:40.190
OTHER SOME DISTRICTS ARE LOOKING

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:41.625
AT IMPACTS FROM CYCLING THIS IS

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.460
NOT TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD THE

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:44.862
PINOCHET FACILITY IS A PAINFUL

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.664
EXAMPLE.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.199
I AM BY CONTRAST THE SOUTH COAST

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:50.534
IN ITS PERMITTING PROCESS FOR

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.469
THE VALLEY FACILITY DID MODEL

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:53.637
DIFFERENT TYPES OF STARTS AND

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:54.171
STOPS AND LOOKED AT THEIR

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.673
IMPACTS.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:56.840
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:57.975
SOME AIR DISTRICTS MODELING

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.643
IMPACT AND OTHERS NEGLECTING TO

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.211
DO THAT MODELING ALL OF OUR

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:03.113
COMMUNITIES DESERVE THAT

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.782
ANALYSIS AND SECTION DE IS

00:43:04.848 --> 00:43:07.117
NECESSARY TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY

00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:08.619
AND ENSURE THE ANNOUNCES HAPPENS.

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:10.120
WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:13.190
THANK YOU NECKS WERE.

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:14.525
THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:15.492
CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:16.593
COMMITTEE ON LOWER WITH LYNN

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.161
WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:18.429
SCIENTISTS GOING TO KEEP THIS

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:19.430
REALLY SHORT BECAUSE I THINK

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:21.031
THAT SENATOR WIECKOWSKI IN CHINA

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:22.366
JUST HAD A GREAT JOB INTRODUCING

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.500
THE BELL.

00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:24.401
ALL TO SAY THAT YOU ALL KNOW

00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:25.703
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:27.104
COMMITTED TO A TRANSITION AWAY

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.539
FROM NATURAL GAS TO MEET OUR

00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:30.140
ELECTRICITY NEEDS ARE STRONG

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.508
CLIMATE POLICIES ARE RENEWABLE

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:33.043
PORTFOLIO STANDARD ARE

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.178
INEVITABLY.

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.179
TAKING US DOWN THE ROAD OF

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.814
REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON GAS TO

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.482
THE GREAT BENEFIT OF OUR ECONOMY

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:40.050
AND OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:42.052
HOWEVER NATURAL GAS CURRENTLY

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.454
SUPPLIES ABOUT 40% OF OUR

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.989
ELECTRICITY NEEDS AND WILL

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:46.657
CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:48.125
ROLE IN THE GREAT FOR SOMETIME

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:49.326
AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:50.627
UNDERSCORE.

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:52.229
THAT THE PURPOSE OF SB SIXTY

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.097
FOUR IS NOT TO ENDED

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:55.299
INDISCRIMINATELY SHUT DOWN GAS

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:56.967
RATHER THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO

00:43:57.034 --> 00:43:58.635
ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AN

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.170
ISSUE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HAVE

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.238
HAPPEN.

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.806
AND EXPECT TO GET MORE ACUTE AND

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:04.475
THAT IS THE MORNING THE MORE

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:06.410
FREQUENT INCREASE IN THE CYCLING

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.045
OF NATURAL GAS UNITS AND THE

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:10.014
POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.547
THIS CAN HAVE ON LOCAL AIR

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:12.950
QUALITY.

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:14.151
SO AS WE HEARD BEFORE THE

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:15.152
PROBLEM IS THAT MANY OF THE

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:16.587
STATE'S PLANTS WERE BUILT TO

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:17.988
PROVIDE BASELOAD STEADY STATE

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:19.990
POWER NOT EXPECTED TO BE TURNED

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:22.326
ON AND OFF A LOT AS A RESULT.

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:24.061
THIS MORE FREQUENT CYCLING WAS

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:26.163
NOT ANTICIPATED AND MANY OF THE

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.098
ORIGINAL AIR QUALITY PERMITS S.

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.533
B. SIX BEFORE WE DO THREE THINGS

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.068
IT WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.603
ACCESSIBILITY OF THE DATA MADE

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:33.570
AVAILABLE.

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:34.605
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:35.506
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.207
HAPPENING TO THE OPERATION OF

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:38.575
THE FLEET AND HOW THAT'S

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:39.943
CHANGING OVER TIME.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.678
WITH THE AMENDMENTS AGREED TO IN

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:42.913
THIS COMMITTEE THE AIR DISTRICTS

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.314
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SIMPLY TAKE

00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:46.116
THIS INFORMATION INTO ACCOUNT

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.618
DURING THEIR PERMIT REVIEWS.

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:48.485
AND FINALLY THE BILL WOULD

00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:52.790
REQUIRE EASY TO CONDUCT A STUDY

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:54.091
TO MAP OUT WHAT THE INEVITABLE

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:56.126
TRANSITION AWAY FROM NATURAL GAS

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.795
LOOKS LIKE. TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:59.797
SUCH A TRANSACTION I TRANSITION

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.031
HAPPENS IN A WAY THAT

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:02.499
PRIORITIZES REDUCTIONS ON

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:04.601
GENERATION IN COMMUNITIES MOST

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.203
IMPACTED BY FOSSIL FUELS.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.704
SO CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:08.872
STARTING TO FEEL THE IMPACTS OF

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:10.707
CLIMATE CHANGE AND COMMUNITIES

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:12.009
IN THE STATE SOME OF THE

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:13.877
UNHEALTHY AS AIR IN THE COUNTRY.

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:15.345
FOR THIS REASON IT'S CRITICAL

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:16.480
THAT WE SHIFT TO CLEANER NON

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.048
FOSSIL RESOURCES.

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.416
BUT THE STATE ALSO NEEDS BETTER

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:20.884
TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.252
CHANGING OPERATION OF THE GAS

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.521
FLEET MAY IMPACT AIR QUALITY.

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.657
AN EXPLICIT MECHANISM TO MAKE

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.525
DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE IF WE

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:31.361
DECIDE THAT IS A PROBLEM.

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:32.463
S. B. SIXTY FOUR WOULD ENSURE

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:33.597
THAT CALIFORNIA'S RAMP UP AND

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:34.965
CLEAN GENERATION DOES NOT LEAD

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.567
TO THE INTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:38.368
FREQUENTLY CYCLING GAS PLANTS IN

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:39.269
A WAY THAT INCREASES AIR

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:40.537
POLLUTION THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:42.206
THANK YOU.

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.108
I LOOK AT IT.

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:46.243
POPULOUS IN THE MID UPPER IN

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:48.378
SHAW WITH A PEN WORLD ONLY A

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.313
COSPONSORED BILL --

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:54.084
AND I JUST URGE DRIVE VOTE LIKE

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.752
CAUSE ACCEPT EVERYTHING THAT

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:58.922
NEEDS TO BE SAID. FOR AS CHAIR

00:45:58.989 --> 00:45:59.523
MEMBERS JOHN WHITE WITH THE

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.157
CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN IN SUPPORT

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:00.657
OF THE BILL [inaudible]

00:46:00.724 --> 00:46:02.659
THANK.

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:05.295
THEN OF ASK IS WAY WITH ON THE

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:06.296
CALIFORNIA ROOM JUST SCIENCE BUT

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:07.197
I LIKE TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR A

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:07.931
COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER

MIND CHANCE BUT HE JONES FOR THE

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:15.859
INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS --

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:17.728
AND WE ARE --

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:18.328
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WE ARE

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:19.696
POSTED WITHOUT PRIOR NATURAL

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:20.831
RESOURCES AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.966
FACT THAT IT'S BEEN AMENDED BUT

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:24.635
WE STILL DON'T LIKE THE BILL

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.669
WHICH UP PERHAPS WON'T COME AS A

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.470
SURPRISE.

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.205
WE BELIEVE THAT SB SIXTY FOUR ON

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:30.374
A IN NECESSARILY CREATES A

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:35.312
TENSION BETWEEN A NEW ERA THE

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:37.514
THE RELIABLE OPERATION THE GRID

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.750
AS IT EXISTS TODAY --

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.184
YOU KNOW POST ENERGY CRISIS YEAH

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:43.654
LEGISLATURE PASSED AB FIFTY

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.988
SEVEN OF WHICH RESULTED IN --

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:46.123
OVER THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS OR

00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:47.724
SO ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND

00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.593
MEGAWATTS OF NEW NATURAL GAS

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.228
FACILITIES THAT --

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.363
REPLACE OLDER LESS EFFICIENT --

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.299
UNITS ARE IN SOME OF THOSE OLDER

00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:57.134
UNITS THAT WERE REPLACED BY THE

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.435
WAY WE'RE IN DISADVANTAGED

00:48:58.502 --> 00:48:59.770
COMMUNITIES LIKE HUNTERS POINT

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.805
PATROL HILL CHULA VISTA WHICH

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:03.507
SEEMS TO GO UNNOTICED BY --

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.608
THE PROPONENTS --

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.809
THE FACT A MATTER IS GAS

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:07.778
PRODUCES ABOUT 40% OF THE ENERGY

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:09.646
WE NEED FOR RAMPING WHICH IS

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:10.614
VERY IMPORTANT --

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:13.750
IN YOU AND AND OBVIOUSLY --

00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:16.053
OPERATES AT NIGHT AND PRODUCES

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.387
POWER WHEN THE TRANSMISSION

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:18.155
SYSTEMS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:20.424
FIRES AND ACCORDING TO THE S. B.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.559
THREE FIFTY STUDY --

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:25.629
CONSTITUTES ABOUT 1% TERRY

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:27.831
POLLUTANTS IN THE IN THE IN THE

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.132
STATE SO LET'S.

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.701
KIND OF GO THROUGH THIS VERY

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:31.368
QUICKLY --

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.470
DE DATUL GAS INDUSTRY AVERAGE

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:35.038
REPRESENT MOST OF THE

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.440
INDEPENDENTLY OWNED --

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:38.342
BASICALLY ARE HEAVILY REGULATED

00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:39.776
ALREADY BY THE LOCAL AIR

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.545
DISTRICTS --

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:43.714
IT TO MEET LOCALIZED --

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.116
STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.084
THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD WITH THE

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.719
GAY ISSUE OF KNOCKS THAT IS A

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:51.288
LOCAL ISSUE THAT IS NOT LIMITED

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:52.723
TO A CENSUS TRACK --

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:54.124
THAT IDENTIFIES THE DISADVANTAGE

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:56.126
COMMUNITY --

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:57.527
A BIT IS IT IT IT'S A BROADER

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:58.962
REGIONAL PUT OUT SORT OF ISSUE

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:00.564
AND IS ALREADY REGULATED THEY

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.065
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MEET EMISSIONS

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.834
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.535
PARTICIPATING CAP AND TRADE --

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:07.037
THE FACT THAT THE LOCAL AIR

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:09.406
DISTRICTS ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:10.607
BILL UNLESS ADMITTED SHOULD TELL

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:12.142
YOU SOMETHING IT'S NOT OFTEN

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:13.810
THAT THE REGULATORS AND THOSE

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:15.412
THAT ARE BEING REGULATED SORT OF

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:16.646
AGREE ON AN ISSUE --

00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:18.315
SO WE WE REALLY HAVE A WE ARE

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:21.551
VERY TROUBLED BY THAT --

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:22.853
BASICALLY I THINK IT SECTION BE

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:23.854
AS WAS INDICATED EARLIER IS

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.956
DECIDE TO GIVE INFORMATION IT

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:27.157
SEEMS THAT THE REST OF THE IT IT

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.692
SEEMS THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:30.794
IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA.

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.596
BUT THEN WE WANT TO REGULATE.

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.363
WE WENT AT THESE OTHER TYPES OF

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.198
REGULATIONS BASED ON THE FACT

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:36.800
THAT WE WANT TO APPLY SOME DATA

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:37.801
TO IT SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT --

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:38.902
PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:40.470
HORSE ON THAT --

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:42.506
DNF SECTIONS ARE STILL THERE

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.040
NEAR TROUBLING A AND AGAIN WE

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:46.109
BELIEVE THAT THIS CREATES YET A

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.711
NEW AIR QUALITY STANDARD THAT

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.646
DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:50.781
PLANTS GET DISPATCHED.

00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:52.816
OKAY IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS BUT

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.584
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH BODY IAN

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:55.385
HAVE SECTIONS NEED TO COME OUT

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:56.787
COMPLETELY --

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:58.889
AND THEN FINALLY SECTION --

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:00.090
TO IS IS --

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:02.692
AYE I THINK TOTALLY IN A THE

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:05.462
COMMISSION TRYING TO DETERMINE --

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:06.263
YOU KNOW HOW PRIVATE BRA

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.631
PROBABLY ALL POWER PLANTS ARE

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.332
GOING TO BE RETIRED --

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:11.468
AS ANALYSIS INDICATES A DOES NOT

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:13.003
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ISSUES LIKE

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.638
COST RELIABILITY IN THOSE OTHER

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:16.873
ISSUES SO OTHER THAN THAT IT'S

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.875
FINE BUT WHERE TO PUT OPPOSED A.

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:21.278
B. ESPY'S AT SIXTY FOUR ANALYTIC

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:22.312
URGENT ABOUT.

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.247
RIGHT AND I AM MY UNDERSTANDING

00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:25.615
IS THAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL DO

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:30.220
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SUGGEST.

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:33.723
YES RIGHT AND WELL YES PRODUCT

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.559
THE COVER I DON'T THINK IT PAY

00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:36.159
TO THE AMENDMENTS.

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:39.529
OUT WILL COST THE ENTHUSIASM OF

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:40.831
MISTER SCOTT NAY JONES.

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:43.767
YES OPPOSITION WE DO AGREE ON

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:44.901
THAT WILL NOT A CLOSE LOOK ON

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.203
YET ANOTHER WE'RE MOVING IN THAT

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:47.871
DIRECTION WHETHER.

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.440
WE GET IT THERE.

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:54.010
RIGHT RIGHT DATES.

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:55.479
ABOUT ONE'S ATTENTION TO AND

00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:56.546
THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH THE

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:57.747
OPPOSITION BUT ON PAGE SIX OF

00:51:57.814 --> 00:51:59.149
THE ANALYSIS --

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:00.217
WHERE WE REFERRED?

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.185
TO A STRIKE IN THE REPORTING OF

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:04.521
DATA BY THE DALLAS IN AUTHORITY --

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:08.391
WHICH IS PAGE THREE LINES TWENTY

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.025
FIVE TO TWENTY SEVEN AND INSTEAD

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:12.462
REQUIRE THE GAS PLANTS REPORT

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:13.697
THAT DATA TOOK PART.

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:15.932
CORRECT AND THEN ON PAGE

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:16.233
[inaudible]

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:19.269
SEVEN OTHER COMMITTEE --

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:20.904
MINUTES SHOW THAT --

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:24.374
STRIKING SUBDIVISIONS E. AND F..

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:25.775
PAGE.

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:28.912
FOUR LINES TWENTY THREE THROUGH.

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.347
TWENTY NINE PAGE FIVE LINES ONE

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:34.084
THROUGH [inaudible]

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.853
THIRTY SEVEN YES YES.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.788
SO THAT MEANS SECTIONS DNF WOULD

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:40.891
BE DELETED YES CURRENT

WE HAVE BEEN LAW TODAY A WIDE

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:13.229
VARIETY OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ON

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:15.565
HOW WE PERMIT POWER PLANTS FOR

SAID I HEAR TOXIC HOTSPOTS

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.976
ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.177
OF THOSE FACILITIES ON ADJACENT

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.145
COMMUNITIES.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.581
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING A MS

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:32.815
WATERS WHEN SHE WAS IN THIS

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:33.950
BUILDING AUTHORED A WONDERFUL

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:36.819
LAWYER TOXIC HOTSPOTS PROGRAM

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:38.354
THE PROBLEM WITH. ONE OF THE

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:43.159
PROBLEMS WITH THE IS THAT IN DE

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:45.428
R. PARAGRAPH.

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.998
I SEE WHERE REQUIRED NOW DO

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.433
SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE SIMILAR

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.703
BUT DIFFERENT AND IN FACT A AND

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.805
B. AND C. ARE ALL SIMILAR IN

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.707
THAT RESPECT IN THAT THEY PUT IN

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.809
PLACE A NEW REQUIREMENT THAT'S

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:00.877
VERY SIMILAR.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.212
SEE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.548
DO UNDER THE WATERS ACT BUT IT'S

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.616

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.384
WEAKER.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:11.187
AND SO THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.255
IT'S COMPLETELY AN UNINTENDED

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:13.656
CONSEQUENCE OF THAT BUT THE

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.424
PROBLEM IS THAT.

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.059
WE'VE GOT OUR EXISTING WATERS

NEW REQUIREMENT.

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:24.100
SO NOW LET'S SAY THAT A POWER

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.835
PLANT COMES THEN WHAT ARE THEY

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:26.135

BE AT THIS LEVEL POLLUTION THAT

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.220
WERE SAYING THE WAY IT'S BEING

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:00.089
OPERATED IT'S AT THAT LEVEL OF

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:03.292
POLLUTION IT'S UP TO US I'M FIX

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:03.859
YOUR CALL THE BOARD THE GOOD

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:04.760
REPORTED.

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.362
BUT IT'S UP TO US TO DETERMINE

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:11.133
WHAT THE PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD BE.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.868
THOUGH I LET ME JUST DIDN'T SAY

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:13.703
THAT I THINK IT'S A GOOD

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.404
QUESTION AND AND SECTION DE WE

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.739
BELIEVE IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:17.907
BECAUSE IT.

01:06:17.973 --> 01:06:20.309
IT MAKE SURE THAT THIS NEW

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.644
ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION THAT

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:22.378
WE'RE CREATING [inaudible]

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:24.113
IS.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.781
EVALUATED IT DOESN'T JUST SIT

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.083
THERE IT'S PART OF THE PROCESS

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.151
THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS.

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:30.386
IT'S PART OF THE INFORMATION

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.487
THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS TAKEN

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:32.822
WHEN THEY EVALUATE.

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:34.090
THE PLANT IN A PERMITTING

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:36.192
PROCESS THE BILL EXPLICITLY DOES

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:38.294
NOT SPECIFY WHAT TO DO WITH THAT

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.829
INFORMATION OR WHETHER TO DO

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.130
ANYTHING WITH THAT INFORMATION.

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:42.565
IT JUST REQUIRES THAT THAT

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:43.966
INFORMATION BE PART OF THE

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:51.640
EVALUATION PROCESS.

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:53.909
I DON'T THINK YOU SO I GUESS MY

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.745
PART PARTLY MY CONFUSION IS

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:56.011
GENERALLY.

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:58.614
ON MR ALLISON'S VERY MUCH

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.016
ALIGNED WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.184
SPONSORS OF THE GROUP THE

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.153
SPECIAL AIR QUALITY ISSUES SO.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.020
WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET A BETTER

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.390
UNDERSTANDS HOW COME?

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:09.024
HOW COME THERE'S MISALIGNMENT

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:11.060
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOALS OF

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:12.628
MISTER HARRIS'S AGENCIES ARE

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:14.630
EXACTLY THE GOALS AS ESPOUSED IN

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:15.498
THE BILL?

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:17.733
I IS IT REALLY AN IMPLEMENTATION

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.667
ISSUE IS HERE.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:23.205
ON NO IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:23.472
REGARDING.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:26.575
THE MANAGEMENT OF THE STATE AND

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:27.109
THEN JUST TRY TO GET OF

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.144
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THERE IS

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.378
THIS --

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.213
DISCONNECT WHEN THERE SEEMS TO

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.014
BE ALIGNED WITH THE OVERALL

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:36.519
GOALS OF THIS ISSUE.

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:37.319
MATTHEW MISTER ALLISON BUT

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.622
THAT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR.

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.123
AND THEN THE SPONSORS TO OF

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.892
THEIR WORK AND THAT'S FINE.

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:45.861
WAS REYES WHO WANTED TO REPLY

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:46.929
AND THEN THE SITE IF YOU.

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:48.164
I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION WE

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.498
VERY MUCH DO WHAT TO CUT

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.467
EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS.

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.702
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.004
THINK ABOUT AS WE GET MORE

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:58.107
RENEWABLES THE EFFECTIVE CYCLING.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:00.509
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NO

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.378
PROBLEM THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE.

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:05.080
OF BE AND SEE THE PARTS THAT.

01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:06.816
ARE AS WELL AS SECTION WHO THE

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:09.618
PARTS THAT YOU GET AT THAT ISSUE.

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.187
THE REASON THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:14.223
WITH THE D. IS THAT WE BELIEVE

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.392
THAT DATA IS GOING TO HAMPER OUR

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.561
ABILITY TO DO THE REGULATORY

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:19.862
PERMITTING WORK ON THESE

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.564
FACILITIES.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:24.066
THAT WE NEED TOO TILL IT SETS UP

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:25.334
UP PARALLEL BUT DIFFERENT

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:29.138
PROCESS. FOR MORE THE POLL.

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:31.207
THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:35.544
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE --

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.614
THERE ARE A VARIETY IS.

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:41.917
OF ISSUES WITH SOME FOR EXAMPLE.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.953
WE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.654
WERE GIVEN AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK IN

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.323
A THE JUDGE THE EFFECTIVE

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:49.792
DISPATCH.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.227
ON THE STATE'S GOAL.

01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:52.394
TO MINIMIZE THE MISSING FROM

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.096
THESE FACILITIES WHICH IS NEVER

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.564
DEFINED HER SAID ANYWHERE.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.199
IN LAW CURRENTLY ARE IN THIS

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.033
BILL.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.336
SO IT SETTING US UP TO FAIL AND

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:01.670
IT'S SETTING UP TO POWER LOW

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:04.373
PROPHECIES. FOUR THINGS THAT

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.608
ALREADY EXIST WHICH CORPORATE IF

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.943
THE PROBLEM.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.945
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:12.448
YES AND THANK YOU FOR I MIGHT

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:13.983
THIS IS A MISTER TING AN

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:15.417
EXCELLENT.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.286
QUESTION WHY A WE ARE NOT IN ON

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:21.757
EXACTLY THE SAME PAGE AND SO THE

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:24.927
AYE AIR TOXICS.

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.662
RULE WHICH ON COMMUNITIES FOR A

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.464
BETTER ENVIRONMENT WAS EXTREMELY

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.565
SUPPORTIVE OF ADDRESSES

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:30.633
DIFFERENT [inaudible]

01:09:30.699 --> 01:09:32.968
POLLUTANTS THEN THE CRITERIA

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:35.571
POLLUTANTS THAT WERE VERY

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.039
CONCERNED ABOUT FROM GAS FIRED

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.674
POWER PLANTS.

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:41.710
AND AND SO IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT IN

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:44.213
PARALLEL BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.180
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.749
THING AND WE ARE NOT SEEING

01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:47.483
THESE.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.618
OBJECTIVES BEING ACCOMPLISHED

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.620
STATEWIDE AS I SAID IN MY

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.923
OPENING REMARKS SOME AIR

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:56.559
DISTRICTS ARE IN FACT LOOKING AT

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.626
CYCLING IMPACTS SOME ARE

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.361
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:01.730
AND SO --

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.933
YOU KNOW TO PURSUE YOU YOU KNOW

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.801
THE GOAL OF BREATHABLE AIR FOR

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.536
ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.772
IS WHAT SB SIXTY FOUR BRINGS US.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:13.943
AND THE NOT NO EXISTING --

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:15.744
LAWS OR RULES SEEM TO BE DOING

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:18.247
THAT AT THE MOMENT [inaudible]

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.582
TIA FOLLOW.

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:23.252
YEAH SO I I GUESS I'M I'M STILL --

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:23.852
HAS ALSO MATHIS QUESTIONS OF A

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:25.454
DIFFERENT --

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:28.390
I MEAN GENERALLY MY AIR QUALITY

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:29.959
DISTRICT WHICH IS BESET MISTRUST

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:30.993
REPRESENTS WERE SEEN AS THE MOST

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.361
AGGRESSIVE.

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:35.965
THE MOST PROGRESSIVE PALM

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.733
USUALLY WERE NOT SEEN AS THE

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.300
ONES WHO NEED TO BE DRAGGED

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.068
ALONG USUALLY WERE KIND OF

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:40.169
LEADING THE PACK.

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:43.138
SO HELP ME UNDER IS IS IT.

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:44.740
GEE IS IT YOUR FEELING THAT.

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.542
ARE YOU WANT TO MOVE IN THIS

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:47.843
AREA AND THE AIR QUALITY

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.878
DISTRICTS IN GENERAL OR EVEN

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.780
SPECIFICALLY THE BAY AREA ONCE.

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.048
ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MOVING

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.283
THIS DIRECTION WAS THERE SORT OF

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:57.987
BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE I'M JUST.

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:59.355
WE'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:00.422
SITUATION JUST WERE CLEAR THE

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:02.057
SOUTH COAST IS OKAY WITH THIS

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:03.792
LANGUAGE THERE THE LONGEST AT

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:04.259
LEAST THAT'S WHAT THE

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.728
INFORMATION THAT I'VE GOT THAT

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:06.695
THEY DON'T HAVE.

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.564
AN OBJECTION TO THIS SO WITHIN

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:11.333
THE YEAR THE REGIONAL DISTRICTS.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.135
YOU KNOW I I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:15.104
THIRTY EIGHT OF THEM I'VE GOT.

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.039
TWO OF THEM THEY'RE HERE.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.907
BUT BILL FISCAL SENATOR WHAT WHY

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.075
IS OUR AIR QUALITY.

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:22.077
DISTRICT OPPOSED TO YOUR BILL.

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:24.513
USUALLY I GUESS THEIR THEIR JOY

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.448
SEEN AS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE.

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:30.619
ON GOING AFTER POLLUTANTS.

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.221
NOW IF AT MEAN.

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:34.056
IT'S A CONCERN TO ME TOO BUT I

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.859
YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO CREATE

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:38.560
AND TRYING TO CREATE A SITUATION

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:39.361
WHERE WE GET THE BEST

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:40.896
INFORMATION.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.631
ON HOW THE CITY'S THESE PLANTS

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.633
ARE OPERATING IN TODAY'S WORLD

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.601
BUT RECENT WITH CYCLING AND IF

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.468
IT [inaudible]

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.337
CREATES.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:49.571
HEARTBURN BECAUSE WE HAVE NEW

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.840
CRITERIA THAT WERE ASKING THAT'S

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:53.542
MEANINGFUL TO US THAT I WANT TO

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:54.843
HAVE.

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:55.778
PUT IN THE FORM THAT'S OF

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:57.813
AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE CAN USE

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.916
AND ALSO WE GET A STEADY BEN.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:01.684
I GUESS WE HAVE HARPER AND I'M

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.950
YOU KNOW.

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:07.523
I I KEEP I'VE READ THIS FOURTEEN

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:08.791
TIMES I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:11.226
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE LANGUAGE

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:13.128
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THAT.

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:15.631
TRIPS EVERYBODY UP --

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:16.298
THAT REALLY IS WHERE YOUR CHOIR

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:17.232
SUMMERS.

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.567
AND MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND IF

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:20.769
IT DOES IF IT DOES THAT'S

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:22.504
PROBABLY A GOOD THING IT'S

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.506
PROBABLY A GOOD THING TO SAY HOW

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.975
WE OPERATE IN THE NEW WORLD THAT

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.110
WE LIVE IN THAT WERE.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.311
RECYCLING ALL THE TIME WHAT IS

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:32.915
THE GOOD AND THEY AND LET THAT

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.683
LOOK THAT.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.218
PLANTS FALL INTO THE BIG

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.786
CATEGORIES THAT THEY ARE.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:38.854
BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE COMMUNITY

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:41.290
IT'S UP TO US TO STE PART TWO

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:42.291
COMES LATER WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL

OUR MICRO GRAVITY AND ENERGY

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.858
STORAGE EFFORTS.

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:13.194

COMMITTEE FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS.

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:25.673
THE WARREN --

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.576
IT GETS US ABOUT 90% OF THE WAY

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:31.679
THERE THE ONE ARE WHERE WE STILL

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.548
HAVE ISSUE IS HIS BULLET FOR

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:35.216
BULLET.

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:37.819
THREE ON PAGE [inaudible]

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:38.686
SIX WHICH ADDRESSES [inaudible]

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:41.556
TARIFFS --

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:45.627
THE MAIN CONCERN HERE IS AROUND.

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:48.396
A WHAT WE CALL NET ENERGY MAY

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:50.698
METERING OR ANY M. TARA AND

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:53.368
CURRENTLY THE WAY THAT WORKS IS.

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.803
YOUR CONSUMPTION IS NETTED

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:58.072
AGAINST YOUR USE [inaudible]

01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:01.442
AND OUR YOU GET CREDIT FOR THAT

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:04.412
WHERE WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT.

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:08.216
IS IF ANY ACCESS GENERATION.

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:11.586
GETS CREDITED AT THE RETAIL RATE.

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:13.621
THAT IS A BIG COST SHIFT FOR OUR

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:15.189
CUSTOMERS [inaudible]

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:17.291
THOSE THAT.

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:19.427
WOULD HAVE A MICROCLIMATE FIGHT

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:20.962
FOR THEM WITH YET.

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:24.032
ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:25.833
PRICE OF ENERGY IS ALMOST

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.701
TENFOLD.

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:28.703
SO IT WOULD BE A COST SHIFT FOR

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:30.738
OUR CUSTOMERS.

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:33.408
AND SO THAT THAT IS OUR MAJOR.

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.576

WITH THIRD PARTY DEVELOPERS AND

01:38:41.815 --> 01:38:43.183

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.618
WE'RE PUTTING OUT AN IMPORTANT

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.053

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:52.793
KEEPING --

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.361

THE TABLE TO AND I'M REALLY

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:57.064
APPRECIATIVE OF THE COALITION

01:38:58.899 --> 01:39:00.467
UNIQUE TO SEE --

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:03.170
BOATS BOTH SIDES SORT OF PLAYING

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:04.905
TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'S

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:06.740
BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:08.275
ROOM FOR EVERYBODY IN THE FUTURE

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:10.577
OF ENERGY STORAGE --

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:11.779
SO -- I KNOW

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.480
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.482

THEY BE AYE ACTUAL DEMAND SIDE

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:15.602
CUSTOMERS ARE GENERATORS THAT

USE ENERGY STORED BY THE METER --

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:19.239
WE WOULD STILL --

POTENTIALLY OWN UP 250%.

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.426
OF THE BILL SINCE BEEN AMENDED

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:40.627
THAT THAT'S THEIR RELIABILITY

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:42.095
BASED ENERGY STORAGE REQUIRE A

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.330

CCA'S DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:47.968
AND UTILITIES.

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:49.036
ARE I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT ALSO

01:41:49.102 --> 01:41:49.536
HAS A CONCERN WITH THIS

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:50.370
DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT'S THE IT

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:52.039
IS THE OPERATION OF THE ENERGY

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:53.941
STORED ITSELF THAT'S CRITICAL TO

01:41:54.007 --> 01:41:55.642
MAINTAINING A RELIABLE AND

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.211
AFFORDABLE GREAT OPERATIONS.

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:59.079
AND IT IS ONLY THE UTILITIES

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:00.647
THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:04.051
THE CPC IN FEDERAL REGULATORS --

DIRECTLY REGULATED BY THE CPC

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.323
AND IF WE REQUIRE THEM TO

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:10.858
PROCURE THIS RELIABILITY BASED

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:11.725
ENERGY STORAGE.

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:14.294
OF DEL OPERATED FOR THE BENEFIT

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:14.928
OF THEIR CUSTOMERS AND

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:16.063
SHAREHOLDERS --

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:18.832
IN CASE OF A OF A DIRECT ACCESS

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.601
PROVIDER AND THEY SHOULD.

01:42:20.667 --> 01:42:21.268
ALL UTILITIES ON THE OTHER HAND

01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:22.903
IS YOU MAY BE AWARE DON'T MAKE

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:24.371
MONEY AND IN THE ENERGY

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:26.240
PROCUREMENT BUSINESS A WE ARE

01:42:26.306 --> 01:42:27.174
REQUIRED BY COMMISSION RULE TO

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:28.475
BETTER RESOURCES AT THEIR ACTUAL

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:29.276
COSTS.

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:30.577
SO THAT THE GRID CAN OPERATE

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:32.613
EFFICIENTLY AND AFFORDABLY AND

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.681
RELIABLY FOR ALL CUSTOMERS.

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:35.716
BUT THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:37.651
ABOUT ALLOCATION ALL CUSTOMERS

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:39.286
IS IT'S JUST NOT ALTS USING ALL

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:41.054
A LOAD SERVING AS IT'S JUST NOT

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:41.755
PRACTICAL.

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:43.023
IF YOU THINK ABOUT A SITUATION

01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:44.157
WHERE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED

01:42:44.224 --> 01:42:45.359
MEGAWATT REQUIREMENT INPALM

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:47.160
SPRINGS WOULD YOU REALLY WANT

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:48.795
SOMEBODY LIKE LANCASTER OR

01:42:48.862 --> 01:42:50.564
PEOPLE RIVERA. TO HAVE TO DO A

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:51.932
HALF OF MEG A LOT PROCUREMENT

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.967
ENERGY STORAGE AND PALM SPRINGS

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:55.636
OR DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.137
THE UTILITY DO IT.

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:58.672
ARE AND HAVE IT TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:00.173
ECONOMY OF SCALES AND

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.375
IMPORTANTLY BE ABLE DETERMINE

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:02.743
THE OPTIMAL LOCATION FOR THAT

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:04.511
STORAGE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:05.812
ITS USE BEST MEETS THE GRAD

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.915
AGAIN UNDER THE FULL OVERSIGHT

01:43:07.981 --> 01:43:09.416
OF THE CPUC.

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:11.251
AND THEN --

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:13.253
FINALLY JUST WANT --

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.888
TO A REMIND EVERYONE THAT HOW WE

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:16.523
DON'T KNOW HOW THE CCA MODELS

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:17.691
GOING TO TURN OUT AND WE DON'T

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:19.226
KNOW HOW THE S. P. MODELS GOING

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:20.460
TO TURN OUT --

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:22.496
IT MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL IT THEY

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:23.597
MAY NOT BE EVER IF.

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:24.998
IF IT DOES CHANGE OVER TIME AND

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:26.133
WE'VE ALLOCATED ENERGY STORAGE

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:27.868
REQUIREMENTS TO THEM HOW DO WE

01:43:27.935 --> 01:43:28.635
AS A STATE ENSURE THAT THAT

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:30.404
ENERGY STORAGE IS THEN AVAILABLE

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:31.805
TO THE UTILITIES UNDER THE CPU

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:33.073
SEES OVERSIGHT.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.708
FERRETTE MEETING CRITICAL GREAT

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:34.942
DATA --

01:43:35.008 --> 01:43:36.677
OPERATIONS --

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:37.878
ALT RESPECTFULLY REMIND THIS

01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:39.446
COMMITTEE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.214
INFAMOUS AT ENERGY CRISIS WAS

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.449
THE RESULT OF CRITICALLY NEEDED

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:44.751
RESOURCES NOT BEING OPERATED.

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:45.852
BY ENTITIES --

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:48.989
THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIABILITY --

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:51.792
AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT OUR SB

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:52.326
THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN IT'S

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:53.060
INTENDED.

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:54.061
TO TREAT ENERGY STORAGE NO

01:43:54.127 --> 01:43:55.329
DIFFERENT THAN POLES AND WIRES

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:56.763
IT DELIVERS ELECTRICITY WHEN

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:57.965
CUSTOMERS NEED IT WHERE THEY

01:43:58.031 --> 01:43:58.398
NEED IT.

01:43:58.465 --> 01:43:59.399
AND AND THAT IS A UTILITY

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:05.038
FUNCTION.

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:06.440
BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED --

01:44:06.506 --> 01:44:10.877
EXPLICIT WITNESS.

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:12.412
OKAY GIVEN BIRTH GOOD AFTERNOON

01:44:12.479 --> 01:44:14.314
MY NAME IS JANICE LYNN.

01:44:14.381 --> 01:44:15.315
ON THE CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE

01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:17.017
DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:18.652
STORAGE ALLIANCE.

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:20.487
I'LL BE VERY BRIEF.

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:21.021
WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:23.023
CALIFORNIA'S STUCK IT'S GREAT

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.558
EXPORT WE HAVE AND ONE THING'S

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:25.926
CLEAR AND I THINK ONE THING WE

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.694
CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THE DOC IS

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:28.962
GETTING STUCK HERE IN FACT IT'S

01:44:29.029 --> 01:44:29.896
LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE AN

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:32.265
OSTRICH.

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:34.234
IN TWENTY AND THE REASON IS IS

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:37.070
THE NECK BONNAT LOAD RAMP IN

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:37.838
TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT NET LOAD

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:39.272
RAMP WAS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:40.641
MEGAWATTS.

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:43.477
ACCORDING TO THE CASE SO BY.

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:44.378
TWENTY TWENTY THAT KNACK THAT

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:46.213
MAXIMUM THREE OUR NET LOAD RAMP

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:47.781
WILL EXCEED SIXTEEN THOUSAND

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.650
MEGAWATTS.

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:52.319
THAT'S JUST TWO YEARS FROM NOW.

01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:53.487
TO MEET THIS NEED WE NEED TO

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:55.822
CONTRACT FOR FLEXIBILITY NOW.

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.357
AND THAT'S WHAT SB THIRTEEN

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:59.126
FORTY SEVEN DIRECTS.

01:44:59.192 --> 01:45:00.627
SO JUST REALLY BRIEFLY ONE I

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:01.962
WANTED TO SAY ABOUT ENERGY

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:04.765
STORAGE IS IT IT IS THE ULTIMATE

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:05.699
FLEXIBILITY TOOL.

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:07.234
IT REPRESENTS A VERY BROAD ASSET

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:09.102
CLASS EVERYTHING FROM THERMAL

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:10.570
STORAGE CAN BE LIKE CITED

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.472
ANYWHERE AROUND THE CURRENT TO

01:45:12.539 --> 01:45:15.542
VERY LARGE PULP TIGHTROPE.

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:16.109
IT COULDN'T --

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:17.811
OUT.

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:19.946
PERFORM MULTIPLE SERVICES EVEN

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.581
FROM THE SAME ASSET IT CAN BE

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:23.383
REPROGRAMMED AND MOST

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:24.551
IMPORTANTLY AND THIS WILL AND

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.153
THEN I'LL WRAP UP.

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:28.121
ENERGY STORAGE CAN BE DEPLOYED

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:30.590
WITH THE ASSETS WE ALREADY HAVE.

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:31.958
SO IT YOU KNOW IT'S IN THE

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:33.760
DISCUSSION EARLIER.

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:35.195
FOSSIL PLANTS WHEN THEY RAN UP

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:36.563
AND THEIR GOAL THEIR RAMPING UP

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:37.330
AND DOWN THEY'RE NOT VERY

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:38.665
EFFICIENT THEY PRODUCE A LOT OF

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:39.700
POLLUTION.

01:45:39.766 --> 01:45:41.001
INTEGRATING STORAGE WITH A

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:43.370
FOSSIL PLAN CAN ABSORB THAT LOAD

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:45.072
FOLLOWING THAT FLEXIBILITY AND

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:46.707
ALLOW THE UNDERLYING ASSET TO

MANDATES FROM THE CALIFORNIA

CONTEMPLATED IN THIS BILL --

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:17.524
ARE ISSUES AT THIS POINT I ARE

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:19.292
ARE REALLY CONFINED TO THE

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:20.760
LANGUAGE PROPOSED UNSUB DE.

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:23.230

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:25.565
PROCUREMENT ECONOMY.

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.634
IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR GIVEN THAT

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:29.369
THE LANGUAGE IS REQUIRING THAT A

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:31.171
C. C. A. OR OTHER LOAD SERVING

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:32.939

THAT -- A

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.175
RESOURCE IS COST EFFECTIVE AND

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:37.143
VIABLE WHO THAT SHOWING IS GOING

01:48:37.210 --> 01:48:38.311
TO BE MADE.

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:39.312
TO IF IT'S THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:40.580
UTILITIES COMMISSION THAT WOULD

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:42.115
BE OUTSIDE OF HOW WE'VE

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.617
TRADITIONALLY BEEN TREATED AS

01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:45.785
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES AGAIN

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:47.153
BECAUSE THE CPUC DOES NOT.

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.723
HAVE THE AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW TO

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:51.358
SET PROCUREMENT FOR US AND

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:52.726
THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF

01:48:52.792 --> 01:48:54.628
CONFUSION THAT WHEN WE START

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:56.429
TALKING ABOUT UTILITY OWN

01:48:56.496 --> 01:48:58.832

01:48:58.899 --> 01:49:00.500
CCA'S OUR LOAD SERVING ENTITIES

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:02.435

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:03.703
AMENDMENTS HOWEVER WE ARE.

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:05.872
UTILITIES SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:06.706
THAT WOULD MEAN.

01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:08.074
TIME WE BELIEVE THAT.

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:09.409

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:11.011

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:19.819
STATUTE --

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:21.288
BUT ABSENT THAT AMENDMENT WE

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:21.888

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:34.226
ON DEAL WITH WE KNOW THAT THE

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:38.264
CDC IS ALREADY GONNA REQUIRING

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.864
TWENTY TWENTY ZERO NET ENERGY

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:39.965
BUILDINGS WHICH THEN WE HEARD

02:05:40.032 --> 02:05:41.000
TESTIMONY THAT THEIR BASIC ON

02:05:41.066 --> 02:05:42.635
PAR WITH THE MARKET.

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:45.604
BUT NEVERTHELESS --

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:47.473
THERE'S GONNA BE A REQUIREMENT

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:48.240
ON THE BUILDING ENVELOPE ARE

02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:48.974
READY.

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:51.377
AND WE THINK THAT IF WE

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:54.113
ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURERS YOU KNOW.

02:05:54.179 --> 02:05:55.814
ATTITUDE TO WORK WITH DEVELOPERS

02:05:55.881 --> 02:05:56.916
AND GIVES PUT SOMETHING OUT

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:59.151
THERE ON THE SHELVES THAT

02:05:59.218 --> 02:05:59.752
WOULDN'T THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:01.553
THAT OUT WE THINK THAT THAT

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:02.688
SHOULD BE I THINK WHAT THE BILL

02:06:02.755 --> 02:06:05.257
SAYS THAT'S NEW BUILT --

02:06:05.324 --> 02:06:07.126
AND ALSO WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT

02:06:07.192 --> 02:06:09.528
THAT ACTUALLY IS BEYOND TITLE.

02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:12.498
TWENTY FOUR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE --

02:06:12.564 --> 02:06:13.966
WE ALSO THINK THAT ABOUT SIXTEEN

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:15.167
MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE IN THE

02:06:15.234 --> 02:06:16.769
BILL PROGRAM AND THIS IS WHERE

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:18.771
WE'VE REALLY JUST HOT OFF THE

02:06:18.837 --> 02:06:20.039
PRESSES COME OFF OF WORK A

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:22.741
DISCUSSION THIS MORNING --

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:24.343
WHERE WE THINK THAT --

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.312
THAT BACK OF THE ENVELOPE COULD

02:06:26.378 --> 02:06:29.748
GO INTO OVER --

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:31.216
THIRTY THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING

02:06:31.283 --> 02:06:33.352
TO COVER THE COSTS --

02:06:33.419 --> 02:06:34.687
THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL THAT WE

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:35.921
SEE BETWEEN CHOOSING THE

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:37.923
TRADITIONAL TECHNOLOGY OR NOW

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.425
GOING -- FOR

02:06:39.491 --> 02:06:40.859
MAINLY OUR CALCULATIONS FOR THE

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:43.495
HEAT PUMP ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP

02:06:43.562 --> 02:06:44.263
FIVE FOR WATER HEATING AND SPACE

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:45.597
HEATING --

02:06:45.664 --> 02:06:47.900
WE ALSO THINK THAT --

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:50.069
YOU COULD STRICTLY FOCUS THAT ON

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:52.237
AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW INCOME

02:06:52.304 --> 02:06:53.672
AREAS --

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:56.041
BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATORS JUST

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.643
HAD RECENTLY HAD A BIG DEBATE ON

02:06:57.710 --> 02:06:59.178
THAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:00.612
PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT WE CAN

02:07:00.679 --> 02:07:02.381
COMPLEMENT LIKE.

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:03.882
THE SET ASIDE IN S. CHIP THAT'S

02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:06.085
FOR LOW INCOME --

02:07:06.151 --> 02:07:06.452
MISS EGGMAN'S --

02:07:06.518 --> 02:07:09.822
PROGRAM --

02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:11.190
THREE AND MAYBE --

02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:12.925
OTHER THE OTHER PROGRAM

02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:15.027
REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:17.363
THE EP YOU SEE --

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:19.031
HAS -- HAS

02:07:19.098 --> 02:07:21.066
RECENTLY ADOPTED I'M A FEW

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:22.401
MILLION DOLLARS FOR MEASUREMENT

02:07:22.468 --> 02:07:24.203
EVALUATION ETCETERA.

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:27.239
WHERE P. GENIE CANNOT ACCEPT --

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:29.008
LANGUAGE IS HAVE OUR GAS

02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:31.543
CUSTOMERS PAID FOR THE FUEL

02:07:31.610 --> 02:07:34.713
SWITCH TO ELECTRIFICATION --

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:36.515
IT AND TO TELL YOU WHY WE'RE

02:07:36.582 --> 02:07:37.816
OPPOSED TO THAT IS BECAUSE THINK

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:41.186
OF THE DYNAMIC RETAIL MARKET

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:42.955
THAT WE HAVE NOW.

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:44.723
AND BUNDLED CUSTOMERS ARE

02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:46.358
LEAVING AND OTHERS ARE LEFT

02:07:46.425 --> 02:07:48.127
BEHIND AND THERE'S FEWER

02:07:48.193 --> 02:07:50.729
CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR FIXED COSTS

02:07:50.796 --> 02:07:51.030
[inaudible]

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:52.765
SO.

02:07:52.831 --> 02:07:55.000
WE DO NOT WANT A SCENARIO WHERE

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:57.569
WE ARE HAVING GAS CUSTOMERS THAT

02:07:57.636 --> 02:08:00.639
PAID FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO LEAVE

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:00.939
THE SYSTEM.

02:08:01.006 --> 02:08:03.308
AND OTHERS ARE LEFT BEHIND WITH

02:08:03.375 --> 02:08:06.678
FIXED COSTS SO WE DO NOT WANT TO

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:08.514
SEE -- GAS

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:10.015
CUSTOMERS --

02:08:10.082 --> 02:08:14.086
PAPER PAPER THIS PROGRAM --

02:08:14.153 --> 02:08:17.122
AND SO I'M AS YOU CAN SEE I HOPE

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.857
YOU AGREE THAT WE'VE REALLY

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.659
THOUGHT HARD --

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:23.362
ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:24.430
PROGRAM.

02:08:24.496 --> 02:08:25.964
I'M WE HAVEN'T --

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:29.068
COMPLETELY FINISHED PROPOSING --

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:31.503
AMENDMENTS TO THE ALL --

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:34.807
BUT THOSE ARE ALONG THE LINES --

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:36.842
OF WHAT WE'RE THINKING SO.

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:38.477
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:40.145

REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:17.449
IF WE FIND A WAY TO GET OFF

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:19.818
NATURAL GAS IF WE ARE GOING TO

02:09:19.885 --> 02:09:22.221
NEED OUR CLIMATE GOALS --

02:09:22.287 --> 02:09:24.890

NOW THIS READ THIS HERE IT SAYS

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:46.578
CONSEQUENTLY OTHER NOT INTENDED

02:09:46.645 --> 02:09:48.280
BY THE AUTHOR THE FUNDING OF

02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:49.982
BUILDING TECH FROM ELECTRIC GIGI

02:09:50.048 --> 02:09:50.916
LANCE'S RESULT IN A NEW POT

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:52.317
PURPOSE PROGRAM CHARGE ELECTRIC

02:09:52.384 --> 02:09:54.086
CUSTOMERS. TO INSURE THAT THIS

02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:55.187
BILL A PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGES

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:56.522
DOES NOT OCCUR THE COMMITTEE MAY

02:09:56.588 --> 02:09:57.122
WISH TO CONSIDER LIMITING THE

02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:58.023
FUNDING.

02:09:58.090 --> 02:09:59.224
THE BILL THE TEXT NO MORE THAN

02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:01.193
FIFTY MILLION A YEAR FROM.

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.494
CHICHI GAS ANNOUNCES I'M

02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:03.595
ACTUALLY STRUGGLE BUT WITH AN

02:10:03.662 --> 02:10:05.230
UNDERSTANDING THAT.

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:06.165
AT THAT POINT CAN YOU JUST THAT

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:08.367
YEAHSENATE AYE I WAS PRO TOO

02:10:08.433 --> 02:10:09.434
QUICK IN MY OPENING STATEMENT

02:10:09.501 --> 02:10:14.106
BUT I I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAVE

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:15.974
A SPILLOVER AFFECTED TRIGGER AN

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:17.809
AUTOMATIC NEW PUBLIC PURPOSE

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:19.611
CHARGE THAT WAS NEVER THE GOAL.

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.680
BUT I'M SORT OF STUCK HERE

02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:23.348
BECAUSE NOW I'M HERE FROM THE

02:10:23.415 --> 02:10:25.184
OPPOSITION THEY DON'T WANT IT TO

02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:26.185
COME FROM.

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:30.055
THE GAS SIDE OF THE UTILITY AYE

02:10:30.122 --> 02:10:31.423
AYE USING THIS STATE --

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:32.925
PURCHASE ALLOWANCES FOR THE CAP

02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:34.359
AND TRADE PROGRAM AND THOSE ARE

02:10:34.426 --> 02:10:36.595
CONSIGNED BACK IN THAT REVENUES

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:37.396
PLACE THE P. YOU SEE TO DELIVER

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:39.164
REPAIR BENEFITS OF THE ELECTRIC

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:40.299
SIDE HAS SOME THAT'S CARVED OUT

02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:40.666
THAT.

02:10:40.732 --> 02:10:42.167
SOME WHICH FUNDS MISS SEGMENTS

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:43.869
PROGRAMMING LOW INCOME SOLAR AND

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:44.803
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:46.305
GASP RIGHT NOW IF WE LEAVE IT ON

02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:47.706
TOUCH TO GOES RIGHT BACK TO

02:10:47.773 --> 02:10:48.407
RATEPAYERS.

02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:52.244
JUST ONE BIG CHUNK BUT NOT.

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:55.581
THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT WAS BECAUSE

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:56.181
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IN THE

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:58.350
BUILDING SECTOR IS A MIX OF

02:10:58.417 --> 02:10:59.918
INNOVATIVE GAS TECHNOLOGY

02:10:59.985 --> 02:11:01.587
INNOVATIVE ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY

02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:03.155
RIGHT AN ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP NEW

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:04.756
WAYS TO INTEGRATE ARE IN G. THE

02:11:04.823 --> 02:11:05.624
BILL WAS.

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:06.925
DESIGNED TO BE TECHNO TRY

02:11:06.992 --> 02:11:08.460
APPRECIATE FOLKS WANT TO SEE

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:10.329
LESS GAS IN THE SYSTEM BUT IT

02:11:10.395 --> 02:11:11.630
ACTUALLY WASN'T HERE TO EXCLUDE

02:11:11.697 --> 02:11:12.998
GAS.

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:14.433
THAT'S WHY WE ORIGINALLY HAD IT

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:16.902
WITH ELECTRIC AND GAS A BUT I'M

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:18.737
I'M I'M DEFERRING TIP TO THE

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.372
COMMITTEE ON THAT FRONT IN TERMS

02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:22.074
OF HOW TO CONSTRAIN THIS BUT I I

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:23.141
WOULD.

02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:25.177
I AM OPEN.

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:26.511
TO A ADDING THAT SAVINGS BECAUSE

02:11:26.578 --> 02:11:27.980
THE STATE THIS WON'T TRIGGER ANY

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:28.981
NEW PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGES.

02:11:29.047 --> 02:11:30.682
AND BE.

02:11:30.749 --> 02:11:33.352
ARE THERE OTHER POTS S. CHIP WAS

02:11:33.418 --> 02:11:34.353
MENTIONED I KNOW THE COMMITTEE

02:11:34.419 --> 02:11:35.687
MOVE SOMETHING ALONG ON THAT

02:11:35.754 --> 02:11:37.756
FRONT --

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:39.925
THERE'S EPIC FUNDS IN SOME C. E.

02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:40.959
C. PROGRAMS THERE'S ACTUALLY

02:11:41.026 --> 02:11:42.094
LEFT OVER DOLLARS IN THE NEW

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.862
SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:46.031
SO I'M OPEN TO THOSE FUNDING

02:11:46.098 --> 02:11:47.799
SOURCES I DON'T WANT TO PUT.

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:49.368
THIS WHOLE BURDEN NECESSARILY ON

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:52.404
GAS CUSTOMERS BUT YEAH

02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:52.704
[inaudible]

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:56.842
THAT'S THAT'S MY COMMENT ON INTO

02:11:56.908 --> 02:11:58.076
THEIR MEN'S WOULD WOULD WOULD

02:11:58.143 --> 02:12:00.078
STAY WITHIN JUST THAT GASOLINE

02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:01.913
BUT I'M I'M UP.

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:04.983
SO IS THIS SPENDING.

02:12:05.050 --> 02:12:06.351
SOME OF THAT CLIMATE CREDIT OR

02:12:06.418 --> 02:12:07.853
IS THIS A NEW CHARGE ON RATE

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:09.454
PAYERS TO BE ABLE TO US THAT

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.056
THAT'S THE PART I'M.

02:12:11.123 --> 02:12:11.623
NOT IN CHARGE OF WITHIN THE

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:13.492
CRIME OCCURRED.

02:12:13.558 --> 02:12:16.194
WITHIN YEAH SO SO TO BE CLEAR

02:12:16.261 --> 02:12:18.430

02:20:35.059 --> 02:20:36.795
FROM ANY KIND OF ATTACK OR

02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:37.729
ANYBODY THAT WOULD ENGAGE IN

FOUL PLAY.

02:20:39.798 --> 02:20:40.932
THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS

RESPONDERS IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT

02:20:46.437 --> 02:20:48.306

THEY'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE THERE.

02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:54.679
DEAD PEOPLE BEAR THAT RISK EVERY

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:56.781
SINGLE DAY THEY'RE NOT PLAN.

02:20:56.848 --> 02:20:58.116
AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT TO

02:20:58.183 --> 02:20:59.617
THE STATE CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED

02:20:59.684 --> 02:21:01.619
THIS ONE FACILITY IS 10% OF OUR

02:21:01.686 --> 02:21:04.222
STATE'S ELECTRICITY. 10% CARBON

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:05.590

AND IF I COULD SAY WHAT I THINK

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:11.529
HAPPENED TO THOSE WORKERS.

02:21:11.596 --> 02:21:14.566
BEING PROMISED A CERTAIN THING.

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:16.100
AND HAVING THAT REDUCED WAS

02:21:16.167 --> 02:21:18.269
UNFAIR.

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:19.671
I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO BE TOLD

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:20.705
IF YOU STATE YOU'RE GONNA GET

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:22.707

KEEP THIS FACILITY RUNNING.

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:26.244
YOU CAN'T RUN NUCLEAR FACILITY

02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:27.745
PERHAPS.

02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:29.647
THERE'S NO WAY.

02:21:29.714 --> 02:21:31.082
AND YOU CAN GET WORKERS FROM OUT

02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:31.616
OF STATE TO MOVE SOMEWHERE

02:21:31.683 --> 02:21:33.051
THAT'S GONNA CLOSE.

02:21:33.117 --> 02:21:35.153
THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO.

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:36.087
AND THEY WERE PROMISED ACTS AND

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:38.323
THEY GOT REDUCED I THINK THAT

02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:39.624
WAS UNFAIR I THINK IT'S AN

02:21:39.691 --> 02:21:40.725
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT RIGHT

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:42.293
IT'S GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE STATE

02:30:50.374 --> 02:30:51.842
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

02:30:51.909 --> 02:30:53.444
THE CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE SIXTY

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:54.044
FIVE MILLION FOR LOCAL CITIES

02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:55.980

02:30:56.046 --> 02:30:57.314

02:31:03.521 --> 02:31:04.522
FUND THAT ALSO LACKS ANY

02:31:04.588 --> 02:31:05.990
SPECIFICITY.

02:31:06.056 --> 02:31:07.425
I'M TURN DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT

REPAIRS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

MAKE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PAYMENTS

02:31:10.628 --> 02:31:12.096
TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES EVERY TIME

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:13.531
A MAJOR UTILITY ASSET IS REMOVED

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:14.965
FROM SERVICE.

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:16.600
SINCE THE PLANT WAS FIRST

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:18.302
COMMISSION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:19.170
FOUR THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN

02:31:19.236 --> 02:31:20.905
AWARE THAT DIABLO CANYON WAS

02:31:20.971 --> 02:31:22.039
SCHEDULED TO CLOSE AT THE END OF

02:31:22.106 --> 02:31:23.808
ITS CURRENT LICENSE.

02:31:23.874 --> 02:31:25.176
THE RECENT PEW SEE DECISION ONLY

02:31:25.242 --> 02:31:27.144
REINFORCES THIS PRE EXISTING

02:31:27.211 --> 02:31:28.612
EXPECTATION.

02:31:28.679 --> 02:31:29.980
OUR CONCERN IS THAT S. B. TEN

02:31:30.047 --> 02:31:31.048
NINETY WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO

02:31:31.115 --> 02:31:32.750
EVERY OTHER COMMUNITY AFFECTED

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:34.485
BY A PLANT CLOSURE TO SEEKS

02:31:34.552 --> 02:31:36.353
SIMILAR SUPPORT PAYMENTS.

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:37.388
THAT WOULD BE FINANCED THROUGH

02:31:37.455 --> 02:31:39.490
RATE INCREASES ON ALL CUSTOMERS.

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:40.925
WE HAVE OFFERED TO ALTERNATIVES

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:42.760
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL.

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:44.428
ABOUT ONE WE WOULD PROPOSE THAT

02:31:44.495 --> 02:31:45.229
THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER

02:31:45.296 --> 02:31:46.430
AUTHORIZING MONEY FROM THE

02:31:46.497 --> 02:31:47.965
STATE'S GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT

02:31:48.032 --> 02:31:49.767
THE COMMUNITY PAYMENTS IF IT IS

02:31:49.834 --> 02:31:50.968
INDEED A STATEWIDE OBLIGATION

02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:51.735
IT'S WE PAID BY ALL THE

02:31:51.802 --> 02:31:52.536
TAXPAYERS [inaudible]

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:54.738
SECOND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

02:31:54.805 --> 02:31:56.974
CONDITION ANY RATE PAIR FUNDING

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:58.209
ON EQUIVALENT CONTRIBUTION FOR

02:31:58.275 --> 02:32:00.177
P. GENIES OWN SHAREHOLDERS THAT

02:32:00.244 --> 02:32:01.545
HAVE REALIZE SUBSTANTIAL PROFITS

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:02.847
FROM THE OWNERSHIP OF THE

02:32:02.913 --> 02:32:03.447
FACILITY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

02:32:03.514 --> 02:32:04.882
DECADES.

02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:06.283
SO WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE

02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:07.918
RETIREMENT OF THIS PLANT WILL

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:09.119
HAVE IMPACTS IN THE SURROUNDING

02:32:09.186 --> 02:32:09.954
COMMUNITIES.

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.789
THE LEGISLATURE MUST RECOGNIZE

02:32:11.856 --> 02:32:12.990
THAT THE LOCAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:15.259
OF DIABLO CANYON WILL NOT END

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:18.162
WHEN THE FACILITY SHUTS DOWN IN.

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:18.929
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AT THAT POINT

02:32:18.996 --> 02:32:20.498
B. GENIE WILL BEGIN A DECADES

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:21.932
LONG EFFORT TO DECOMMISSION THE

02:32:21.999 --> 02:32:23.534

OVER TWO AND A HALF BILLION

02:32:25.569 --> 02:32:26.971

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:28.005
A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION

DOLLARS IN EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:30.941
BENEFITS WE BELIEVE THAT THAT

02:32:31.008 --> 02:32:32.576
PROJECT IS GOING TO REQUIRE A

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:34.144
SIGNIFICANT LOCAL WORKFORCE AND

02:32:34.211 --> 02:32:35.446
WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE JOBS

02:32:35.513 --> 02:32:37.348

02:32:40.518 --> 02:32:41.051

02:50:57.847 --> 02:50:58.781
AND RETAIL MARKET.

02:50:58.848 --> 02:51:00.783
AT A TIME WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL

02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:02.318
ADVANCES WEREN'T AVAILABLE AND

02:51:02.385 --> 02:51:03.653
IT WAS EARLY.

02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:04.921
AND IT WE ALL KNOW THE

02:51:04.988 --> 02:51:06.022
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ME IN

02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:08.257
PARTICULAR.

02:51:08.324 --> 02:51:10.193
AND NOW WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS BEEN

02:51:10.259 --> 02:51:12.161
WE HAVE AS WE GRAPPLE WITH SO

02:51:12.228 --> 02:51:14.030
MANY OF THESE ISSUES.

02:51:14.097 --> 02:51:15.365
WE'VE COME ALONG AND SAID WE

02:51:15.431 --> 02:51:16.232
WANT TO START.

02:51:16.299 --> 02:51:17.533
PUTTING IN RENEWABLES AND WE

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:19.535
WANT TO CHANGE FOR SERIES OF

02:51:19.602 --> 02:51:21.270
REASONS.

02:51:21.337 --> 02:51:22.805
HOW WE RELY ON ENERGY?

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:24.741
WILL THAT CHANGE HAS

02:51:24.807 --> 02:51:26.643
FUNDAMENTALLY.

02:51:26.709 --> 02:51:28.144
ARM IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN I

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:29.145
WASN'T WORKING IN THE ENERGY

02:51:29.212 --> 02:51:30.480
CRISIS EVERY LAW THAT WAS

02:51:30.546 --> 02:51:31.614
WRITTEN IN THE WHOLE STATE WAS

02:51:31.681 --> 02:51:33.116
IN THE WRITTEN BY MUNICIPAL OR

02:51:33.182 --> 02:51:34.651
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY.

02:51:34.717 --> 02:51:35.652
AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR

02:51:35.718 --> 02:51:37.020
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN THEY HAD

02:51:37.086 --> 02:51:39.422
REALLY MONOPOLISTIC POWER

02:51:39.489 --> 02:51:40.857
JURISPRUDENTIAL IF YOU WILL.

02:51:40.923 --> 02:51:42.425
AND SOON WE STARTED SAYING WELL

02:51:42.492 --> 02:51:43.026
WE WANTED TO START HAVING A

02:51:43.092 --> 02:51:44.861
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

02:51:44.927 --> 02:51:47.530
WHATEVER YOU THAT WAS TWO

02:51:47.597 --> 02:51:48.064
THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND TWO

02:51:48.131 --> 02:51:48.731
THOUSAND THE U. S..

02:51:48.798 --> 02:51:50.533
WITHOUT BYRON SHEER.

02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:51.100
ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THE

02:51:51.167 --> 02:51:52.568
CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THAT

02:51:52.635 --> 02:51:53.369
WAS WELL.

02:51:53.436 --> 02:51:54.604
IT DOESN'T PERFORM IN THE SAME

02:51:54.671 --> 02:51:56.939
MANNER AS OTHER ENERGY IT'S NOT

02:51:57.006 --> 02:51:59.075
THE EXACT SAME BASES LOADED WITH

02:51:59.142 --> 02:52:00.843
BASED LOADS IN PICKERS AND THE

02:52:00.910 --> 02:52:01.911
LIKE AND WE HAD ALL PRICING

02:52:01.978 --> 02:52:03.880
SCHEDULE.

02:52:03.946 --> 02:52:04.580
YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WE DID

02:52:04.647 --> 02:52:05.882
FLEXURE POWER PROGRAM IS ALL

02:52:05.948 --> 02:52:08.451
ABOUT.

02:52:08.518 --> 02:52:09.686
TRIP SHUT YOUR YOUR YOUR WASHING

02:52:09.752 --> 02:52:10.620
MACHINE OFTEN YOUR LIGHTS OFF IN

02:52:10.687 --> 02:52:12.055
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IN AUGUST

02:52:12.121 --> 02:52:13.489
NOW WE CAN THE MIDDLE THE DAY IN

02:52:13.556 --> 02:52:14.724
AUGUST SOMETIMES WE HAVE IT ALL

02:52:14.791 --> 02:52:16.459
A SURPLUS IN JUNE WE ACTUALLY

02:52:16.526 --> 02:52:18.461
HAVE THE AYE IS SO WHAT YOU'RE

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:19.529
TRYING TO WITH REGIONALIZATION.

02:52:19.595 --> 02:52:20.329
TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF

02:52:20.396 --> 02:52:21.764
ALMIGHTY GOD.

02:52:21.831 --> 02:52:22.632
WE HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE TO TAKE

02:52:22.699 --> 02:52:24.634
THE EXTRA POWER.

02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:26.903
SO PART OF THAT DIAGNOSTIC WHEN

02:52:26.969 --> 02:52:28.171
I FIRST CAME BACK TO GOVERNMENT

02:52:28.237 --> 02:52:29.338
HOW MANY YEARS OF FOUR YEARS AGO

02:52:29.405 --> 02:52:30.540
WHATEVER I DID A DIRECT ACCESS

02:52:30.606 --> 02:52:32.575
BILL.

02:52:32.642 --> 02:52:33.710
AND NOW I'M SITTING WITH THAT

02:52:33.776 --> 02:52:36.546
GUY KILLED JEFF DEXTER NO.

02:52:36.612 --> 02:52:37.180
BACK THEN I THINK IT WAS IN THIS

02:52:37.246 --> 02:52:38.247
COMMITTEE.

02:52:38.314 --> 02:52:40.416
ARM TRYING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

02:52:40.483 --> 02:52:41.984
ON THE RETAIL SIDE FOR

02:52:42.051 --> 02:52:43.086
COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL

02:52:43.152 --> 02:52:45.088
ESTABLISHMENTS CHOICE.

02:52:45.154 --> 02:52:46.489
WHY IS IT IN SUPPORT FOR A LOT

02:52:46.556 --> 02:52:48.958
OF REASONS AND WE THINK THAT

02:52:49.025 --> 02:52:49.492
THEN I'LL LET TURN OVER TO

02:52:49.559 --> 02:52:50.793
MISTER WELCH?

02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:51.527
BUT IT'S GOING TO GIVE THE

02:52:51.594 --> 02:52:52.962
LARGER CONTEXT OF WHAT I'M DOING

02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:55.031
OF LIFTING THAT CAP THAT WE HAD

02:52:55.098 --> 02:52:57.467
WAS SENATOR KEYHOE --

02:52:57.533 --> 02:52:59.669
WHAT YEARS AT NINE TO THE?

02:52:59.736 --> 02:53:01.437
HE IS TWO THOUSAND NINE THERE'S

02:53:01.504 --> 02:53:04.373
TWO THOUSAND I AS IS ALWAYS AS

02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:05.641
WE SEE I CAN NEVER BILL NUMBERS

02:53:05.708 --> 02:53:06.509
ON AROUND GOLDMEMBER.

02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:08.010
BUT THE THE POINT IS IS THAT.

02:53:08.077 --> 02:53:10.179
ARM TO TRY TO CREATE THOSE

02:53:10.246 --> 02:53:13.082
RETAIL MARKETS IN A WAY THAT

02:53:13.149 --> 02:53:15.418
GIVES CHOICE BECAUSE OF A CUT

02:53:15.485 --> 02:53:17.353
BUSINESSES LOOK EVERY BUSINESS

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:19.255
HAS THREATENED FIXED COSTS WHAT

02:53:19.322 --> 02:53:20.623
BUSINESS IS TRYING TO DO IS TO

02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:22.225
BE GREAT CREATIVE TO MANAGE

02:53:22.291 --> 02:53:24.026
THOSE FIXED COSTS.

02:53:24.093 --> 02:53:26.162
AND TRY TO PUT TOGETHER VARIOUS

02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:26.896
CONFIGURATIONS TO REDUCE THEIR

02:53:26.963 --> 02:53:30.633
COSTS AND BY LIFTING THIS CAP.

02:53:30.700 --> 02:53:31.834
THERE'S JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:32.902
MISTER WHICH CAN TALK ABOUT THE

02:53:32.969 --> 02:53:34.303
NUMBERS BECAUSE OF EXTRAORDINARY

02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:36.706
BACKLOG OF COMPANIES THAT ARE

02:53:36.773 --> 02:53:37.840
PRETTY CREATIVE IN THAT WANT TO

02:53:37.907 --> 02:53:40.276
TAKE ADVANTAGE TO REDUCE COSTS.

02:53:40.343 --> 02:53:41.477
ONE I CHAIRED THE LOS ANGELES

02:53:41.544 --> 02:53:42.411
COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

02:53:42.478 --> 02:53:44.013
CORPORATION.

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:47.550
IN 200-042-00011 WE DID SURVEYS

02:53:47.617 --> 02:53:48.818
ON BUSINESS CLIMATE AND

02:53:48.885 --> 02:53:50.453
EVERYBODY ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT

02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:52.155
REGULATION AND ALL THAT STUFF.

02:53:52.221 --> 02:53:53.256
PART NUMBER ONE OF OUR TOP THE

02:53:53.322 --> 02:53:54.323
TOP TWO ISSUES WHICH ENERGY

02:53:54.390 --> 02:53:57.226
COSTS ENERGY COSTS.

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:59.028
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK TO TRY TO

02:53:59.095 --> 02:54:00.530
FIGURE OUT WAYS.

02:54:00.596 --> 02:54:02.198
WILL WE CAN HARMONIZE PUBLIC

02:54:02.265 --> 02:54:04.967
POLICY TO REDUCE ENERGY COSTS

02:54:05.034 --> 02:54:06.169
THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR

02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:08.070
VALUES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ON

02:54:08.137 --> 02:54:08.905
THE ONE HAND.

02:54:08.971 --> 02:54:10.940
YET GIVE SMART COMPANIES THE

02:54:11.007 --> 02:54:12.809
ABILITY TO ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR

02:54:12.875 --> 02:54:14.610
ENERGY COSTS IN WAYS THAT ARE

02:54:14.677 --> 02:54:16.145
MORAL AT A CONSISTENT WITH

02:54:16.212 --> 02:54:17.814
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY BECAUSE

02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:18.815
THEY'RE GONNA GET DIRECT ACCESS

02:54:18.881 --> 02:54:19.682
THEY'RE GONNA BY DIFFERENT

02:54:19.749 --> 02:54:20.583
SOURCES.

02:54:20.650 --> 02:54:21.818
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDUCE

02:54:21.884 --> 02:54:23.619
THEIR COSTS I THINK IT'S TIME

02:54:23.686 --> 02:54:25.421
FOR THIS BILL THAT LOST IN THIS

02:54:25.488 --> 02:54:27.356
COMMITTEE. FOUR YEARS AGO TO

02:54:27.423 --> 02:54:29.192
BRING IT BACK TODAY.

02:54:29.258 --> 02:54:30.059
BUT WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO TURN

02:54:30.126 --> 02:54:33.095
OVER TO MR WHICH GERMAN MEMBER

02:54:33.162 --> 02:54:33.663
SCOTT WHICH CAN BE HALF THE

02:54:33.729 --> 02:54:34.664
CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY

02:54:34.730 --> 02:54:36.232
EMPLOYEES.

02:54:36.299 --> 02:54:37.867
I THINK FOR FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN

02:54:37.934 --> 02:54:39.068
INVOLVED IN ENERGY POLICY --

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:41.404
SINCE -- THE

02:54:41.470 --> 02:54:43.005
EARLY NINETIES --

02:54:43.072 --> 02:54:43.840
AND CERTAINLY SINCE A

02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:45.074
DEREGULATION THEY WILL BE

02:54:45.141 --> 02:54:47.910
SHOCKED SEE ME UP HERE

02:54:47.977 --> 02:54:49.212
SUPPORTING THE BILL TO LIFT THE

02:54:49.278 --> 02:54:50.680
CAP DIRECT ACCESS I'M THE FIRST

02:54:50.746 --> 02:54:52.415
ONE BY THE WAY.

02:54:52.481 --> 02:54:53.282
THE JUST.

02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:54.483
JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE BILL

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:55.952
OVER -- MANY

02:54:56.018 --> 02:54:57.320
MANY MANY YEARS TO HAVE BEEN

02:54:57.386 --> 02:54:59.622
INTRODUCED WE WE HAVE A POST.

02:54:59.689 --> 02:55:01.457
AND SO SO WHAT HAS CHANGED WHAT

02:55:01.524 --> 02:55:02.525
WHAT WE'VE COME TO REALIZE IS

02:55:02.592 --> 02:55:04.093
THAT [inaudible]

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:06.696
A AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK

02:55:06.762 --> 02:55:09.732
POINTED OUT WE'VE BALKANIZED THE

02:55:09.799 --> 02:55:11.100
ENERGY MARKETS IN.

02:55:11.167 --> 02:55:13.169
AND UNDER THE GUISE OF

02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:15.404
COMPETITION WE HOPE WE WE WE

02:55:15.471 --> 02:55:17.406
HAVE ALLOWED CERTAIN.

02:55:17.473 --> 02:55:19.575
TYPES OF OF OF WHAT I WOULD CALL

02:55:19.642 --> 02:55:21.277
FAKE COMPETITION TO OCCUR WE'VE

02:55:21.344 --> 02:55:23.145
ALLOWED --

02:55:23.212 --> 02:55:25.748
CUTIE CHORES AGGREGATORS TO TO

02:55:25.815 --> 02:55:28.517
FORM INTO JUST SWEEP CUSTOMERS.

02:55:28.584 --> 02:55:30.486
AND THEN THE CUSTOMERS HAVE TO

02:55:30.553 --> 02:55:33.356
BE SAVVY ENOUGH --

02:55:33.422 --> 02:55:35.091
TO OPT OUT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:36.659
BE SERVED BY THAT INTO TV LONGER

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:38.728
THAT'S NOT COMPETITION.

02:55:38.794 --> 02:55:39.629
SO WE'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION

02:55:39.695 --> 02:55:42.164
THAT IF YOU GET A DO COMPETITION

02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:43.266
AND YOU'RE GONNA CLAIM THAT YOU

02:55:43.332 --> 02:55:45.468
WANT TO HAVE COMPETITION.

02:55:45.534 --> 02:55:46.936
THE LET'S OPEN IT UP AND ALLOW.

02:55:47.003 --> 02:55:49.639
TRUE COMPETITION TO TAKE PLACE.

02:55:49.705 --> 02:55:51.841
AND THIS IS REALLY A HISTORIC

02:55:51.908 --> 02:55:54.443
MOMENT BECAUSE OF WHEATON DIS

02:55:54.510 --> 02:55:56.145
THE VARIOUS GROUPS HERE THAT ARE

02:55:56.212 --> 02:55:57.847
SUPPORTING THIS BILL HAVE NEVER

02:55:57.914 --> 02:55:59.882
STOOD TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE.

02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:02.485
EVER YEAH AND TO TO QUOTE A TO

02:56:02.551 --> 02:56:04.153

ALANIS MORISSETTE.

02:56:06.155 --> 02:56:07.890
I HAVE TO SAY.

02:56:07.957 --> 02:56:09.959
ISN'T IT IRONIC [inaudible]

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:10.927
NOT.

02:56:10.993 --> 02:56:12.895
DON'T YOU THINK.

02:56:12.962 --> 02:56:14.864
A LITTLE TOO IRONIC.

02:56:14.931 --> 02:56:15.831
THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSING

02:56:15.898 --> 02:56:17.867

02:56:24.674 --> 02:56:26.108
CHOICE.

02:56:26.175 --> 02:56:27.476
I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:56:27.543 --> 02:56:28.911
HAVE CHOICE LET'S LET THE

02:56:28.978 --> 02:56:30.112

03:03:02.404 --> 03:03:03.806
IN DEALING WITH THEM AND I HAVE

03:03:03.872 --> 03:03:05.474
UTMOST RESPECT FOR HIS VIEW OF

03:03:05.541 --> 03:03:10.079
OUR ENERGY ISSUES THANKS A LOT?

03:03:10.145 --> 03:03:13.015
AND SO NOW WILL OF WELCOME. ONE

03:03:13.082 --> 03:03:14.049
TO BE A WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN

03:03:14.116 --> 03:03:30.366
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

03:03:30.432 --> 03:03:31.033
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:32.000
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE

03:03:32.067 --> 03:03:33.135
THAT FRIEDMAN AGAIN WITH THE

03:03:33.202 --> 03:03:34.570
UTILITY REFORM NETWORK I'M NOT

03:03:34.636 --> 03:03:35.704
REPRESENTING COMMUNITY CHOICE

03:03:35.771 --> 03:03:37.272
AGGREGATORS I'M REPRESENTING

03:03:37.339 --> 03:03:38.640
RATEPAYERS AND SPECIFICALLY

03:03:38.707 --> 03:03:40.275
RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS.

03:03:40.342 --> 03:03:41.110
AND I BELIEVE THAT SENATOR

03:03:41.176 --> 03:03:42.211
HERTZBERG DID IDENTIFY A NUMBER

03:03:42.277 --> 03:03:44.046
OF VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

03:03:44.113 --> 03:03:44.813
THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY

03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:46.582
FACING IN ACHIEVING MANY OF ITS

03:03:46.648 --> 03:03:47.816
POLICY GOALS BUT THIS BILL

03:03:47.883 --> 03:03:49.418
DOESN'T ACTUALLY RESOLVE ANY OF

03:03:49.485 --> 03:03:50.119
THEM.

03:03:50.185 --> 03:03:51.587
I'M IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT WILL

03:03:51.653 --> 03:03:53.288
MAKE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE STATE'S

03:03:53.355 --> 03:03:54.923
POLICY GOALS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

03:03:54.990 --> 03:03:56.892
AND THIS IS THE MOST.

03:03:56.959 --> 03:03:58.394
BOB MAJOR AND FUNDAMENTAL

03:03:58.460 --> 03:04:00.929
PROPOSED CHANGE TWO THE STATE'S

03:04:00.996 --> 03:04:02.564
ELECTRICITY MARKETS SINCE THE

03:04:02.631 --> 03:04:05.501
ADOPTION OF ASSEMBLY BILL.

03:04:05.567 --> 03:04:07.236
EIGHTEEN NINETY AND THIS WOULD.

03:04:07.302 --> 03:04:09.104
THIS IS A THIS REPRESENTS A VERY

03:04:09.171 --> 03:04:10.973
SIGNIFICANT SHIFT.

03:04:11.039 --> 03:04:11.573
AND IT SHOULD RECEIVE

03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:12.975
SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION FROM THE

03:04:13.041 --> 03:04:14.676
LEGISLATURE AND ARGUE IT WOULD

03:04:14.743 --> 03:04:16.412
UNDERMINE STATE POLICY GOALS AND

03:04:16.478 --> 03:04:19.381
DESTABILIZE ELECTRICITY MARKETS.

03:04:19.448 --> 03:04:21.083
ARMED WITH RESPECT THE CCA'S WE

03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:22.184
EXPECT THIS WOULD CREATE A

03:04:22.251 --> 03:04:23.986
CRISIS FOR THEM ESPECIALLY THE

03:04:24.052 --> 03:04:26.121
CCA STRUGGLING TO OBTAIN CREDIT

03:04:26.188 --> 03:04:27.222
RATINGS AND TO ENTER INTO

03:04:27.289 --> 03:04:28.757
FINANCE CIVIL COMMITMENTS FOR

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:30.559
NUCLEAR ENERGY RESOURCES.

03:04:30.626 --> 03:04:32.761
ON DIRECT ACCESS SUPPLIERS HAVE

03:04:32.828 --> 03:04:34.863
NO OBLIGATION TO SERVE AND

03:04:34.930 --> 03:04:36.899
INSTEAD THEY OPERATE UNDER

03:04:36.965 --> 03:04:37.666
ESSENTIALLY A CHERRY PICKING

03:04:37.733 --> 03:04:39.134
MODEL WERE ONLY THE MOST

03:04:39.201 --> 03:04:40.469
LUCRATIVE CUSTOMERS ARE OFFERED

03:04:40.536 --> 03:04:42.004
CONTRACTS.

03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:44.907
THIS APPROACH CONTRASTS SHARPLY

03:04:44.973 --> 03:04:45.908
WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED

03:04:45.974 --> 03:04:47.309
UTILITIES THE PUBLICLY OWNED

03:04:47.376 --> 03:04:49.211
UTILITIES AND EVEN THE CCA'S

03:04:49.278 --> 03:04:51.213
THAT PROVIDE UNIVERSAL SERVICE

03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:52.548
ON NON DISCRIMINATORY PRICES AND

03:04:52.614 --> 03:04:54.349
TERMS.

03:04:54.416 --> 03:04:55.617
I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE

03:04:55.684 --> 03:04:57.853
THAT DURING THE TO THOUSAND TWO

03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:58.787
THOUSAND ONE ENERGY CRISIS

03:04:58.854 --> 03:05:00.923
DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS DUMPED

03:05:00.989 --> 03:05:02.157
MOST OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BACK TO

03:05:02.224 --> 03:05:03.625
THE UTILITIES IN ACTION THAT

03:05:03.692 --> 03:05:05.527
EXACERBATED COST PRESSURES ON

03:05:05.594 --> 03:05:06.829
CUSTOMERS WHO NEVER CHOSE TO

03:05:06.895 --> 03:05:09.665
SWITCH. FOR EXAMPLE ENRON

03:05:09.731 --> 03:05:11.433
PERHAPS THE LARGEST DIRECT

03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:12.768
ACCESS SUPPLIER AT THE TIME.

03:05:12.835 --> 03:05:13.936
ON DUMP THE UNIVERSITY OF

03:05:14.002 --> 03:05:15.704
CALIFORNIA BACK TO UTILITY

03:05:15.771 --> 03:05:17.206
SERVICE BECAUSE IT'S ON

03:05:17.272 --> 03:05:18.907
OPPORTUNITY TO RESELL THE POWER

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:20.242
IT HAD BOUGHT FOR THE UNIVERSITY

03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:22.044
OF CALIFORNIA INTO THE WHOLESALE

03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:23.979
MARKET AND MAKE A LARGE PROFIT.

03:05:24.046 --> 03:05:25.647
THIS WAS CONSIDERED EFFICIENT

03:05:25.714 --> 03:05:27.349
ECONOMIC BREACH WE COULD SEE A

03:05:27.416 --> 03:05:28.784
SIMILAR RESULT IF THERE'S

03:05:28.851 --> 03:05:29.885
ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH ENERGY

03:05:29.952 --> 03:05:31.720
MARKETS.

03:05:31.787 --> 03:05:33.222
DIRECT ACCESS IS DOMINATED BY

03:05:33.288 --> 03:05:35.190
SHORT TERM CUSTOMERS AND SHORT

03:05:35.257 --> 03:05:37.459
TERM WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS.

03:05:37.526 --> 03:05:38.727
IT'S SATISFYING RESOURCE

03:05:38.794 --> 03:05:39.862
PLANNING AND STATE POLICY

03:05:39.928 --> 03:05:42.464
OBJECTIVES REQUIRES LONG TERM

03:05:42.531 --> 03:05:42.965
COMMITMENTS TO DRIVE NEW

03:05:43.031 --> 03:05:44.466
INVESTMENT.

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:46.101
BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM

03:05:46.168 --> 03:05:47.769
INVOLVES DEEP INTERDEPENDENCE

03:05:47.836 --> 03:05:49.605
CHOICES MADE BY SOME CUSTOMERS

03:05:49.671 --> 03:05:50.906
TO GO SHORT CAN AFFECT ALL

03:05:50.973 --> 03:05:52.841
CUSTOMERS.

03:05:52.908 --> 03:05:53.976
SO WHO IS GOING TO BE LEFT TO

03:05:54.042 --> 03:05:55.010
MAKE THE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS

03:05:55.077 --> 03:05:57.045
ON BEHALF OF THE SYSTEM.

03:05:57.112 --> 03:05:58.146
WE BELIEVE THE STATE NEEDS TO

03:05:58.213 --> 03:05:59.615
FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE

03:05:59.681 --> 03:06:00.916
CONSIDERING AN UNLIMITED

03:06:00.983 --> 03:06:03.619
EXPANSION OF DIRECT ACCESS.

03:06:03.685 --> 03:06:04.486
AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

03:06:04.553 --> 03:06:05.787
COMMISSION IS STRUGGLING TO

03:06:05.854 --> 03:06:06.722
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THEY HAVEN'T

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:08.223
FIGURED OUT AN ANSWER.

03:06:08.290 --> 03:06:09.591
THEY HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED THEY

03:06:09.658 --> 03:06:10.792
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIRECT LONG

03:06:10.859 --> 03:06:11.894
TERM CORE PROCUREMENT AND

03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:13.729
RESOURCE PLANNING IN A

03:06:13.795 --> 03:06:15.063
FRAGMENTED RETAIL MARKET.

03:06:15.130 --> 03:06:16.765
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED MANY GAPS IN

03:06:16.832 --> 03:06:17.966
THE FRAMEWORK AS PART OF THEIR

03:06:18.033 --> 03:06:19.468
GREEN BOOK PROCESS.

03:06:19.535 --> 03:06:20.302
AND AS REFERENCED IN THE

03:06:20.369 --> 03:06:21.870
ANALYSIS DOWN THIS BILL PRODUCED

03:06:21.937 --> 03:06:22.771
BY THE COMMITTEE.

03:06:22.838 --> 03:06:24.172
THERE LITERALLY IS NO PLAN TO

03:06:24.239 --> 03:06:25.774
COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES OF

03:06:25.841 --> 03:06:28.010
VARIOUS RETAIL PROVIDERS.

03:06:28.076 --> 03:06:29.344
AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT PRIOR

03:06:29.411 --> 03:06:30.946
BILLS THAT WERE CONSIDERING

03:06:31.013 --> 03:06:32.447
EXPANSIONS OF DIRECT ACCESS THAT

03:06:32.514 --> 03:06:33.415
WERE ENACTED RECEIVED

03:06:33.482 --> 03:06:34.583
SUBSTANTIAL DEBATE FROM THE

03:06:34.650 --> 03:06:36.251
LEGISLATURE HERE WE ARE IN THE

03:06:36.318 --> 03:06:37.452
SECOND HOUSE IN THE FIRST POLICY

03:06:37.519 --> 03:06:38.186
COMMITTEE.

03:06:38.253 --> 03:06:39.588
THIS APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY

03:06:39.655 --> 03:06:41.189
CHANCE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.

03:06:41.256 --> 03:06:43.458
AND WHILE THE AUTHORS PRIOR BILL

03:06:43.525 --> 03:06:45.627
TO EXPAND DIRECT ACCESS ON WOULD

03:06:45.694 --> 03:06:46.929
HAVE INCLUDED GUARANTEES THAT

03:06:46.995 --> 03:06:48.430
DIRECT ACCESS CUSTOMERS WOULD

03:06:48.497 --> 03:06:50.432
ACHIEVE 1100% RENEWABLE

03:06:50.499 --> 03:06:51.366
PORTFOLIOS.

03:06:51.433 --> 03:06:52.935
NO SUCH REQUIREMENTS ARE

03:06:53.001 --> 03:06:53.969
INCLUDED IN THIS BILL.

03:06:54.036 --> 03:06:55.837
AS A RESULT.

03:06:55.904 --> 03:06:57.339
ON THE DIRECT THE LEGISLATURE

03:06:57.406 --> 03:06:59.508
SHOULD EXPECT THE DIRECT ACCESS

03:06:59.575 --> 03:07:01.643
PROVIDERS WILL ENGAGE IN MINIMUM

03:07:01.710 --> 03:07:02.110
COMPLIANCE WITH STATE

03:07:02.177 --> 03:07:03.478
REQUIREMENTS.

03:07:03.545 --> 03:07:04.680
AND I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM

03:07:04.746 --> 03:07:06.381
IMAGINING THAT THE ANECDOTES YOU

03:07:06.448 --> 03:07:08.083
HEAR ABOUT CUSTOMERS SEEKING TO

03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.984
OBTAIN HIGHER RENEWABLE

03:07:09.051 --> 03:07:11.486
PORTFOLIOS ARE INDICATIVE OF THE

03:07:11.553 --> 03:07:12.955
TYPICAL DIRECT ACCESS CUSTOMER

03:07:13.021 --> 03:07:14.556
WHO SIMPLY IS LOOKING TO GET THE

03:07:14.623 --> 03:07:16.658
CHEAPEST ENERGY.

03:07:16.725 --> 03:07:18.160
AS A PRACTITIONER I CAN TELL YOU

03:07:18.226 --> 03:07:20.095
THAT ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS

03:07:20.162 --> 03:07:21.229
THAT PROVIDE DIRECT ACCESS SERVE

03:07:21.296 --> 03:07:22.564
ACT SERVICE.

03:07:22.631 --> 03:07:24.800
ROUTINELY CLAIM CONFIDENTIALITY

03:07:24.866 --> 03:07:25.867
PROTECTIONS FOR BASIC

03:07:25.934 --> 03:07:27.536
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR RETAIL

03:07:27.603 --> 03:07:29.304
SALES IN ABOUT THE RESOURCE

03:07:29.371 --> 03:07:31.373
PORTFOLIOS AND AS A RESULT WE

03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:32.941
KNOW SO MUCH LESS ABOUT WHAT

03:07:33.008 --> 03:07:34.543
THEY'RE DOING THAN WE DO ABOUT

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:36.411
WHAT THAT I'LL USE.

03:07:36.478 --> 03:07:38.547
P. O. USE AND CCA'S ARE DOING.

03:07:38.614 --> 03:07:40.649
SO MORE DIRECT ACCESS IN EFFECT

03:07:40.716 --> 03:07:42.618
MEANS LESS TRANSPARENCY AND

03:07:42.684 --> 03:07:44.453
GREATER DIFFICULTY IN PROVIDING

03:07:44.519 --> 03:07:46.221
MEANINGFUL PUBLIC OVERSIGHT THIS

03:07:46.288 --> 03:07:47.155
BILL DOES NOT PROPOSE A FIX THAT

03:07:47.222 --> 03:07:49.458
PROBLEM. FOR THESE REASONS WE

03:07:49.524 --> 03:07:50.993
URGE YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THE ROAD

03:07:51.059 --> 03:07:52.427
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE IN

03:07:52.494 --> 03:07:55.063
THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES AND TO

03:07:55.130 --> 03:07:55.631
NOT APPROVE THIS BILL TODAY

03:07:55.697 --> 03:07:58.467
THANK YOU.

03:07:58.533 --> 03:07:59.601
THANK YOU.

03:07:59.668 --> 03:08:00.736
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE THAT

03:08:00.802 --> 03:08:01.770
WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN

03:08:01.837 --> 03:08:04.906
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

03:08:04.973 --> 03:08:06.475
HEARING NONE WILL WILL BRING IT

03:08:06.541 --> 03:08:07.242
BACK -- TO

03:08:14.149 --> 03:08:15.517
THE BOX AND PUSHES THE ENVELOPE

03:08:15.584 --> 03:08:17.819
AND AS TIME.

03:08:17.886 --> 03:08:19.788
LOOKING FOR WAYS OF CONTINUING

03:08:19.855 --> 03:08:21.590
TO FIND WAYS OF INCREASING

03:08:21.657 --> 03:08:23.325
CHOICE AS YOU POINTED OUT.

03:08:23.392 --> 03:08:25.160
OUR AND ALSO BRINGING DOWN THE

03:08:25.227 --> 03:08:26.395
COST NEVER EXPECT AND

03:08:26.461 --> 03:08:28.797
APPRECIATED --

03:08:28.864 --> 03:08:31.133
I HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION ON THIS

03:08:31.199 --> 03:08:33.168
BILL A TODAY --

03:08:33.235 --> 03:08:36.304
BUT I MUST AT GIVEN VP UC'S

03:08:36.371 --> 03:08:38.440
VALUATION OF THE MARKETPLACE AND

REALLY MOVE IN THE CAP.

03:08:40.308 --> 03:08:42.310
I AT THIS TIME THE INSTABILITY

03:08:42.377 --> 03:08:43.111
THAT WOULD CREATE IN THE

03:08:43.178 --> 03:08:44.146
MARKETPLACE --

03:08:44.212 --> 03:08:46.381
I DO RECOGNIZE THAT AND HAVE

03:08:46.448 --> 03:08:46.915
SOME CONCERN OF WHAT THAT

03:08:46.982 --> 03:08:48.417
REPRESENTS.

03:08:48.483 --> 03:08:50.285
OF SO WITH THAT I WOULD NOT BE

03:08:50.352 --> 03:08:51.920
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

03:08:51.987 --> 03:08:53.088
BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO

03:08:53.155 --> 03:08:56.124
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR AS

03:08:56.191 --> 03:08:57.359
TO HOW THIS MIGHT OF VIEW THIS

03:08:57.426 --> 03:08:58.827
PARTICULAR BILL.

03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:17.045
THINGS --

03:09:17.112 --> 03:09:20.148
I'M ALSO REMINDED OF A OF A THE

03:09:20.215 --> 03:09:24.086
SONGWRITER AND BUT JANICE JOPLIN.

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:25.053
FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR

03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:28.390
NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE --

03:09:28.457 --> 03:09:30.092
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M A LITTLE

03:09:30.158 --> 03:09:34.162
WORRIED ABOUT --

03:09:34.229 --> 03:09:35.464
RIGHT THIS IS BEEN DESCRIBED BY

03:09:35.530 --> 03:09:37.532
IDENTIFIED IN IN THE GREEN BOOK

03:09:37.599 --> 03:09:38.166
AS SOMETHING THAT COULD

03:09:38.233 --> 03:09:39.334
POTENTIALLY CRITIC CRISIS

03:09:39.401 --> 03:09:42.104
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF CAP --

03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:45.807
I THINK I CERTAINLY HEAR FROM --

03:09:45.874 --> 03:09:47.375
A LOT OF INDUSTRY LOUD AND CLEAR

03:09:47.442 --> 03:09:47.943
THAT THAT THAT COSTS ARE TOO

03:09:48.009 --> 03:09:48.677
HIGH.

03:09:48.744 --> 03:09:50.045
RIGHT AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DO

03:09:50.112 --> 03:09:51.747
BUSINESS IN THE IN THE CURRENT

03:09:51.813 --> 03:09:52.748
MARKET THAT WE LIVE IN WITH

03:09:52.814 --> 03:09:54.449
INCREDIBLY HIGH.

03:09:54.516 --> 03:09:57.185
I'M A COST OF OF OF ENERGY AND

03:09:57.252 --> 03:09:59.321
AYE I AGAIN I APPLAUD YOUR

03:09:59.387 --> 03:10:00.388
WILLINGNESS TO CUT IT TO HAVE TO

03:10:00.455 --> 03:10:02.090
GET IN HERE.

03:10:02.157 --> 03:10:04.626
SO BUT NO WE DID THIS WITH

03:10:04.693 --> 03:10:06.061
TURKEY O. THERE WERE SOME CAPS

03:10:06.128 --> 03:10:07.963
IN PLACE.

03:10:08.029 --> 03:10:09.531
AND NOW WE'RE TALKING AND THAT

03:10:09.598 --> 03:10:10.932
WAS ON AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET NOR

03:10:10.999 --> 03:10:12.868
TALK ABOUT GOING LARGER.

03:10:12.934 --> 03:10:15.437
WHY NO CAPS [inaudible]

03:10:15.504 --> 03:10:21.843
AND AND IF AND BUT AND AGAIN.

03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:22.778
EVERY EVERY WEEK WE SAID THIS

03:10:22.844 --> 03:10:23.779
COMMITTEE WE KEEP TALKING WE

03:10:23.845 --> 03:10:25.180
NEED A LARGER ORGANIZING MODEL

03:10:25.247 --> 03:10:27.015
TO BE ABLE LOOK AT OUR ENERGY

03:10:27.082 --> 03:10:28.784
GOING FORWARD AND WE KEEP JUST.

03:10:28.850 --> 03:10:30.719
CREW DOING MORE BILLS.

03:10:30.786 --> 03:10:31.753
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND I

03:10:31.820 --> 03:10:32.854
THINK THE IMPACT OF HOW THEY

03:10:32.921 --> 03:10:33.722
INTERSECT WITH EACH OTHER

03:10:33.789 --> 03:10:34.022
[inaudible]

03:10:34.089 --> 03:10:35.791
AND HAVE.

03:10:35.857 --> 03:10:38.293
THE IMPACT ON ON ON ON THE

03:10:38.360 --> 03:10:39.427
CONSUMER RIGHT WHICH IS THE

03:10:39.494 --> 03:10:39.995
BUDGET THE BOTTOM LINE THAT

03:10:40.061 --> 03:10:40.295
[inaudible]

03:10:40.362 --> 03:10:41.897
I THINK.

03:10:41.963 --> 03:10:43.031
POLICY MAKERS HAVE TO THINK

03:10:43.098 --> 03:10:44.166
ABOUT WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE

03:10:44.232 --> 03:10:44.766
FOR THE CONSUMER HOW DOES THAT

03:10:44.833 --> 03:10:46.101
AFFECT THEM.

03:10:46.168 --> 03:10:47.102
SO CAN YOU ANSWERS LIKE Y. NO

03:10:47.169 --> 03:10:48.804
CAP.

03:10:48.870 --> 03:10:50.205
WOULD YOU SEE THIS GOING THIS IS

03:10:50.272 --> 03:10:50.672
THE BEGINNING OF THE

03:10:50.739 --> 03:10:51.640
CONVERSATION OR IS THIS YOUR END

03:10:51.706 --> 03:10:53.508
PRODUCT.

03:10:53.575 --> 03:10:54.976
RIGHT SHOULD BE MOVING ON TODAY

03:10:55.043 --> 03:10:56.278
BECAUSE YOU WON'T BECAUSE IT CAN

03:10:56.344 --> 03:10:58.146
USE THAT OR IS THIS IT.

03:10:58.213 --> 03:10:58.747
AND I WONDER WHY THE UTILITIES

03:10:58.814 --> 03:11:01.082
ARE SILENT.

03:11:01.149 --> 03:11:02.851
TALKED ABOUT THAT TAPE OKAY SO

03:11:02.918 --> 03:11:03.518
TANACH I I'M NOT SO IS MUSICALLY

03:11:03.585 --> 03:11:04.586
INCLINED BUT I WANT TO BE

03:11:04.653 --> 03:11:07.122
INSPIRED BY JACK KENNEDY IN

03:11:07.189 --> 03:11:07.656
NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WHEN HE

03:11:07.722 --> 03:11:08.490
TALKED ABOUT.

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:09.558
PUTTING SOMEBODY ON THE MOMENT

03:11:09.624 --> 03:11:11.426
AND IT A PERSON A HUMAN BEING ON

03:11:11.493 --> 03:11:12.761
THE MONET SAYS WE'RE NOT DOING

03:11:12.828 --> 03:11:13.929
IT BECAUSE IT'S EASY WOODLAND

03:11:13.995 --> 03:11:14.963
BECAUSE IT'S HARD.

03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:16.832
WELL THAT WAS NINETEEN SIXTY ONE

03:11:16.898 --> 03:11:18.533
TODAY PUTTING SOMEBODY ON THE

03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:19.734
MOAN IS A LOT EASIER WE'VE

03:11:19.801 --> 03:11:21.303
LEARNED A LOT.

03:11:21.369 --> 03:11:22.504
AND EVEN FROM THE TIME WHEN IT

03:11:22.571 --> 03:11:23.672
IS TO SPILL FOUR YEARS AGO

03:11:23.738 --> 03:11:25.507
THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

03:11:25.574 --> 03:11:26.141
THAT.

03:11:26.208 --> 03:11:27.876
I THINK INFORMED THE REASON WHY

03:11:27.943 --> 03:11:29.845
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

03:11:29.911 --> 03:11:30.579
WHICH WORK THEIR CASH BECAUSE

03:11:30.645 --> 03:11:32.614
OUT TO COME OUT AGAINST ME LAST

03:11:32.681 --> 03:11:33.915
TIME AROUND FOR YEARS AGO

03:11:33.982 --> 03:11:34.950
HAVEN'T SHOWN UP.

03:11:35.016 --> 03:11:37.152
AND HERE'S THE REASON.

03:11:37.219 --> 03:11:39.654
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

03:11:39.721 --> 03:11:41.356
TO ADVANCE THE BALL.

03:11:41.423 --> 03:11:43.391
IT IS EASY TO COME UP AND SAY

03:11:43.458 --> 03:11:45.060
THE SKY IS FALLING IN THE SCARE

03:11:45.126 --> 03:11:46.428
POLICYMAKERS.

03:11:46.494 --> 03:11:48.830
THAT WAS DONE IN SO MANY ISSUES

03:11:48.897 --> 03:11:50.832
THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY ALWAYS

03:11:50.899 --> 03:11:52.801
THE WAY TO KILL SOMETHING BUT WE

03:11:52.868 --> 03:11:54.703
HAVE ENGAGE IN EXTRAORDINARILY

03:11:54.769 --> 03:11:56.238
THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATION AND

03:11:56.304 --> 03:11:57.372
CONSIDERATION.

03:11:57.439 --> 03:11:59.708
IN TRYING TO CHANGE THIS MARKET

03:11:59.774 --> 03:12:01.710
WHAT HAVE WE DONE FIRST.

03:12:01.776 --> 03:12:04.079
IT S. B. THREE FIFTY WE SAID

03:12:04.145 --> 03:12:05.714
THAT THIS OUR PS STANDARD OF THE

03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:06.681
TIME I DID THIS WE DIDN'T HAVE

03:12:06.748 --> 03:12:09.284
S. B. THREE FIFTY IS 50% IF S.

03:12:09.351 --> 03:12:11.086
B. BEST BE ONE HUNDRED PASSES.

03:12:11.152 --> 03:12:12.721
IT'S GOING TO BE A 100% IN TERMS

03:12:12.787 --> 03:12:15.023
OF THE OUR PS IN MAKING SURE

03:12:15.090 --> 03:12:16.725
THAT WHATEVER THAT CHOICES IS

03:12:16.791 --> 03:12:18.426
APPROPRIATELY ENVIRONMENTALLY

03:12:18.493 --> 03:12:21.029
SENSITIVE [inaudible] TO THE

03:12:21.096 --> 03:12:22.864
WHOLE COST SHIFTING ARGUMENT

03:12:22.931 --> 03:12:24.199
WHICH NO ONE MADE AND THAT'S THE

03:12:24.266 --> 03:12:26.067
ARGUMENT THAT THE UTILITIES

03:12:26.134 --> 03:12:27.736
ARGUED LAST TIME THAT SOMEHOW.

03:12:27.802 --> 03:12:29.170
WE'RE NOT A WOULD HAVE A COST

03:12:29.237 --> 03:12:30.338
SHIFTING THAT THAT'S JUST ABOUT

03:12:30.405 --> 03:12:31.873
RIGHT THAT THAT QUITE FRANKLY

03:12:31.940 --> 03:12:34.175
WAS THE CORE OF THE OPPOSITION

03:12:34.242 --> 03:12:36.478
LAST TIME THERE'S A VAPID Y..

03:12:36.544 --> 03:12:38.713
BECAUSE THE L. BECAUSE THINK

03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:40.682
MATURITY OF THE PROCESS AND THE

03:12:40.749 --> 03:12:42.817
CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD

03:12:42.884 --> 03:12:45.020
HAS SHIFTED AWAY.

03:12:45.086 --> 03:12:45.820
ARM.

03:12:45.887 --> 03:12:47.522
UNION YOU KNOW I THINK THAT.

03:12:47.589 --> 03:12:49.925
IT AND THE RELIANCE ON THE OUR

03:12:49.991 --> 03:12:52.127
PS IS CREATED IN MY JUDGMENT A

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:54.663
DIFFERENT MARKET THAT WE DIDN'T

03:12:54.729 --> 03:12:55.897
HAVE BEFORE.

03:12:55.964 --> 03:12:57.933
THE OTHER ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE

03:12:57.999 --> 03:13:00.335
THAT TRIED TO TANK THIS WAS WELL

03:13:00.402 --> 03:13:01.603
THERE'S NO LONG TERM CONTRACTS

03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:04.506
WELL S. B. THREE FIFTY DID THAT.

03:13:04.572 --> 03:13:06.541
TO SO THE READ THE REASON THIS

03:13:06.608 --> 03:13:08.209
IS COULD YOU KNOW SEE OLD SCHOOL

03:13:08.276 --> 03:13:11.112
OF OLIVE WOULD GO HOME SAYS WHEN

03:13:11.179 --> 03:13:12.247
THE REASON BUT NO WHICH AT THAT

03:13:12.314 --> 03:13:13.548
WITH THE ART WHEN THE REASON FOR

03:13:13.615 --> 03:13:15.317
THE RULE SEIZE THE RULE SEIZE I

03:13:15.383 --> 03:13:15.784
CAN'T REMEMBER LATIN.

03:13:15.850 --> 03:13:16.418
THE POINT IS THAT.

03:13:16.484 --> 03:13:17.919
THERE'S IMPORTANT REASONS TO DO

03:13:17.986 --> 03:13:20.088
STUFF AND THAT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY

03:13:20.155 --> 03:13:21.790
CHANGED WE ARE NOW IS THE

03:13:21.856 --> 03:13:22.824
CHAIRMAN WAS TRYING TO DO

03:13:22.891 --> 03:13:24.659
REGIONALIZATION.

03:13:24.726 --> 03:13:26.027
CLEARLY MUST TO PASS OF THIS

03:13:26.094 --> 03:13:27.595
COMMITTEE BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE.

03:13:27.662 --> 03:13:29.764
WHAT'S HE DOING WE'RE LITERALLY

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:31.900
IN THIS SITUATION DID PASSED

03:13:31.967 --> 03:13:33.902
BETTER KNOW WHATEVER WE TALKED

03:13:33.969 --> 03:13:34.302
ABOUT THIS WHOLE.

03:13:34.369 --> 03:13:36.271
PARA.

03:13:36.338 --> 03:13:37.973
OF WAS BUT BILL A VAGUE MEAN

03:13:38.039 --> 03:13:40.709
LIKE THIS ONE HERE YOU MEAN OKAY

03:13:40.775 --> 03:13:43.345
BUT ANY INNOCENT GETS WATERY BUT

03:13:43.411 --> 03:13:44.679
IN ANY EVENT THE POINT IS THAT.

03:13:44.746 --> 03:13:45.947
WE LITERALLY PAYING PEOPLE TO

03:13:46.014 --> 03:13:47.282
TAKE ENERGY THINGS THAT WE JUST

03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:49.284
COULDN'T IMAGINE BEFORE SO THAT

03:13:49.351 --> 03:13:51.219
THAT THE COST PROTECTIONS ARE

03:13:51.286 --> 03:13:51.786
THERE.

03:13:51.853 --> 03:13:53.755
THE AND THEN ALSO YOU CAN HEAR

03:13:53.822 --> 03:13:55.156
FROM US OR YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY

03:13:55.223 --> 03:13:55.757
HEARD YOU HEAR THE RESOURCE

03:13:55.824 --> 03:13:57.258
ADEQUACY BILL THE OTHER

03:13:57.325 --> 03:13:59.027
COMPONENT PIECE WAS WHICH WE PUT

03:13:59.094 --> 03:14:00.395
IN.

03:14:00.462 --> 03:14:02.297
WAY BACK IN THE STONE AGE WAS

03:14:02.364 --> 03:14:03.898
THIS NOTION OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY

03:14:03.965 --> 03:14:06.001
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A

03:14:06.067 --> 03:14:07.869
COMPANION BILL TO DO A DIRECT

03:14:07.936 --> 03:14:09.738
ACCESS IS RESOURCE ADEQUACY.

03:14:09.804 --> 03:14:11.406
SO THIS IS LITERALLY A BUT TO

03:14:11.473 --> 03:14:12.974
GET TO YOUR POINT ABOUT BEING

03:14:13.041 --> 03:14:14.342
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS I'M NOT

03:14:14.409 --> 03:14:15.910
TRYING TO JUST WING IT IT'S IT

03:14:15.977 --> 03:14:17.946
IS BELTS AND SUSPENDERS IT IS

03:14:18.013 --> 03:14:20.682
THE EVOLUTION OF THE IDEA.

03:14:20.749 --> 03:14:22.283
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE INVESTOR

03:14:22.350 --> 03:14:23.818
OWNS HERE WHO WERE KILLING ME

03:14:23.885 --> 03:14:25.754
LAST TIME BECAUSE WE'VE SOLVED

03:14:25.820 --> 03:14:26.855
THAT PROBLEM.

03:14:26.921 --> 03:14:30.158
THIS CCA'S I'M A PIXIE CA I

03:14:30.225 --> 03:14:32.227
BELIEVE IN THAT BECAUSE I THINK

03:14:32.293 --> 03:14:33.795
THAT THEY GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

03:14:33.862 --> 03:14:34.396
COMMUNITIES TO DO ALL SORTS OF

03:14:34.462 --> 03:14:35.530
STUFF.

03:14:35.597 --> 03:14:37.265
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONLY ONE GROUP

03:14:37.332 --> 03:14:38.299
THAT GETS IT.

03:14:38.366 --> 03:14:39.534
WE HAVE THESE UNDERLYING

03:14:39.601 --> 03:14:41.903
CHALLENGES THE WHOLE MORE HIGH

03:14:41.970 --> 03:14:43.104
RIVER WOULD DUKE ENERGY CAME TO

03:14:43.171 --> 03:14:44.372
LOS ANGELES AND THEY START TO

03:14:44.439 --> 03:14:45.407
SELL YOUR SOUL THE WORLD AND

03:14:45.473 --> 03:14:47.008
STUFF.

03:14:47.075 --> 03:14:47.876
AND THE LAST ARGUMENT THAT WAS

03:14:47.942 --> 03:14:49.711
MADE WHEN YOU USE THE WORD AND

03:14:49.778 --> 03:14:51.279
RON RIGHT IT'S LIKE OLD MY GOD

03:14:51.346 --> 03:14:52.347
THAT'S JUST A BUZZ WORD FOR BAD

03:14:52.414 --> 03:14:53.281
STUFF.

03:14:53.348 --> 03:14:55.083
WELL GUESS WHAT.

03:14:55.150 --> 03:14:57.118
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

03:14:57.185 --> 03:14:59.220
MANAGERZONE SYSTEM I THINK SAN

03:14:59.287 --> 03:15:01.022
DIEGO LAST TIME I TESTIFIED NO

03:15:01.089 --> 03:15:02.791
ONE IS NOW AT 88%.

03:15:02.857 --> 03:15:04.492
WHAT WHAT IT WAS SEVEN CAMPUSES

03:15:04.559 --> 03:15:06.061
THE ALL MANAGE THEIR OWN STUFF

03:15:06.127 --> 03:15:06.594
THE VOTE THAT THERE WERE

03:15:06.661 --> 03:15:07.762
INTERNAL PEOPLE THEY'RE

03:15:07.829 --> 03:15:09.464
CLAMORING FOR THIS STUFF BECAUSE

03:15:09.531 --> 03:15:10.865
THEY WANT TO REDUCE COSTS WHICH

03:15:10.932 --> 03:15:12.367
HAS ALL SORTS OF IMPACTS ON

03:15:12.434 --> 03:15:13.301
VARIOUS THINGS?

LEGISLATION THAT UNDERLYING

03:15:24.612 --> 03:15:26.981
SOLVES THE ARCHITECTURE AND I

MARRY THIS THIS DIRECT ACCESS

03:15:29.417 --> 03:15:31.519
WITH RESOURCE ADEQUACY WHICH

03:15:31.586 --> 03:15:33.521
BASICALLY IMPOSES THE OBLIGATION

03:15:33.588 --> 03:15:34.889
FOR EVERYBODY HAVE A PLAN IN ONE

03:15:34.956 --> 03:15:35.824
OF THE REASONS WE HAVE THE PLAN

03:15:35.890 --> 03:15:36.658

THERE'S ALL SORTS OF

03:15:43.064 --> 03:15:44.899
CONSEQUENCES TO ALL THAT SO

03:15:44.966 --> 03:15:47.135
WE'VE LITERALLY RE STRUCTURED

03:15:47.202 --> 03:15:49.170
THE PLAYING FIELD THAT ACTUALLY

03:15:49.237 --> 03:15:50.839
NOW I WOULD SUGGEST.

03:15:50.905 --> 03:15:52.640
BEFORE I DIDN'T HAVE A CAP

03:15:52.707 --> 03:15:53.408
BECAUSE I WAS JUST TRYING TO

03:15:53.475 --> 03:15:54.976
MOVE IT UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

03:15:55.043 --> 03:15:56.578
THAT WAS SUCH A HUGE COMPRESSION

03:15:56.644 --> 03:15:58.980
A HUGE DEMAND. FOR THE

03:15:59.047 --> 03:16:00.648
MARKETPLACE THOSE TRY TO GIVE A

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:01.549
LITTLE BUT I HAD ROOM I THINK IT

03:16:01.616 --> 03:16:03.184
TOOK ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO

03:16:03.251 --> 03:16:04.519
FILL UP THE MARKET LAST TIME.

03:16:04.586 --> 03:16:05.920
AND JUST WE DO SOME OF THAT

03:16:05.987 --> 03:16:07.655
COMPRESSION NOW WHAT I'M DOING

03:16:07.722 --> 03:16:09.190
IS TAKING IN THE MARKET IS

03:16:09.257 --> 03:16:11.092
SAYING LOOK WE HAVE MATURED OUR

03:16:11.159 --> 03:16:14.395
POLICY IT IS NOW TIME TO CHANGE.

03:16:14.462 --> 03:16:15.797
I HOPE THAT HELPS YEAH SO YOU

03:16:15.864 --> 03:16:18.133
DON'T HAVE ANY.

03:16:18.199 --> 03:16:19.000
CONCERNED WITH THE CPU SEE

03:16:19.067 --> 03:16:20.335
SAYING [inaudible]

03:16:20.401 --> 03:16:22.237
THEY'RE CONCERNED.

03:16:22.303 --> 03:16:23.705
ABOUT AN ENERGY CRISIS YEAH I'M

03:16:23.771 --> 03:16:25.340
ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE I'M

03:16:25.406 --> 03:16:27.242
ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT YOU

LIVE THROUGH IT YOU KNOW IT IT

03:16:30.278 --> 03:16:31.212
WAS JUST MONEY DEMING WELL

03:16:31.279 --> 03:16:33.848
BALANCED.

03:16:33.915 --> 03:16:35.717
THE THROUGH IT THE POINT OF

03:16:35.783 --> 03:16:36.885
DEFAULT YES.

03:16:36.951 --> 03:16:39.220
HIT DIFFERENT SEAT TO SAY THE

03:16:39.287 --> 03:16:40.288
LEAST APOLOGIZE I DON'T MEAN TO

03:16:40.355 --> 03:16:41.589

BUT IN ANY EVENT --

03:16:46.427 --> 03:16:49.230
THAT THE POINT IS THAT THAT.

03:16:49.297 --> 03:16:51.166
THERE ARE ENOUGH OUR CONSTRAINTS

03:16:51.232 --> 03:16:53.234
IN MY JUDGMENT THAT WE'VE DONE

03:16:53.301 --> 03:16:54.569
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE ME

03:16:54.636 --> 03:16:56.037
I'M SCREAMIN ON THE WHOLE THING

03:16:57.305 --> 03:16:58.239
LIABILITIES.

03:16:58.306 --> 03:16:59.707
THAT I LOOK AT THAT AS A MUCH

03:16:59.774 --> 03:17:01.676
BIGGER RISK PERSONALLY ON ENERGY

03:17:01.743 --> 03:17:03.144
CRISIS BECAUSE IT A CRISIS HAD

03:17:03.211 --> 03:17:04.379
NOTHING TO DO WITH ENERGY ALL

03:17:04.445 --> 03:17:05.346
HAD TO DO WITH.

03:17:05.413 --> 03:17:07.749
PRICING AND THE ABILITY OF OF

03:17:07.815 --> 03:17:10.318

NOT AN ENERGY CRISIS.

03:17:17.692 --> 03:17:19.360
AND I SEE THE SAME THING THAT

03:17:19.427 --> 03:17:21.629
SCARES ME MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT

03:17:21.696 --> 03:17:25.733

03:21:35.783 --> 03:21:37.318
ARE THEY ARE ALREADY TERRIBLY

03:21:37.385 --> 03:21:39.120
CHALLENGED BY THE COMMUNITY

03:21:39.187 --> 03:21:41.355
CHOICE AGGREGATION.

03:21:41.422 --> 03:21:43.157
AND THEY ALREADY HAVE THEIR RD

03:21:43.224 --> 03:21:45.159
CELINE ASSETS FOR DIMES ON THE

03:21:45.226 --> 03:21:48.596
DOLLAR --

03:21:48.663 --> 03:21:50.798
THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN MORE

03:21:50.865 --> 03:21:53.401
STRANDED ASSETS WITHOUT ABILITY

03:21:53.468 --> 03:21:55.736
TO RECOVER.

03:21:55.803 --> 03:21:57.605
THIS MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

03:21:57.672 --> 03:21:59.006
REMAIN WHO ARE PRIMARILY I

03:21:59.073 --> 03:22:02.477
BELIEVE IN REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS

03:22:02.543 --> 03:22:03.644
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO REMAIN WITH

03:22:03.711 --> 03:22:06.047
UTILITIES.

03:22:06.113 --> 03:22:08.483
ARE GOING TO PAY MORE MONEY.

03:22:08.549 --> 03:22:11.152
AND THE CCA'S I DON'T KNOW WHAT

03:22:11.219 --> 03:22:12.787
HAPPENS TO THEM UNDER THIS BUT

03:22:12.854 --> 03:22:13.788
THEY PROBABLY LOSE CUSTOMERS AS

03:22:13.855 --> 03:22:15.690
WELL.

03:22:15.756 --> 03:22:18.059
UP BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT WE

03:22:18.125 --> 03:22:19.727
WILL HAVE STRANDED AT MORE

03:22:19.794 --> 03:22:22.597
STRANDED ASSETS.

03:22:22.663 --> 03:22:23.264
I THINK IF WE'RE GOING LOOK AT

03:22:23.331 --> 03:22:24.899
THIS IT OUGHT TO BE AFTER WE

03:22:24.966 --> 03:22:26.067
HAVE.

03:22:26.133 --> 03:22:28.369
GONE THROUGH THE STORM OF THE

03:22:28.436 --> 03:22:29.570
CCA'S.

03:22:29.637 --> 03:22:31.506
AND WE SEE IF OUR UTILITIES CAN

03:22:31.572 --> 03:22:33.741
STAND ON THEIR AND THE WILDFIRES

03:22:33.808 --> 03:22:35.109
AND SEE IF WE COULD STAND ON OUR

03:22:35.176 --> 03:22:36.611
OWN TWO FEET.

03:22:36.677 --> 03:22:39.380
THE CCA'S ARE ALREADY DAMAGING

03:22:39.447 --> 03:22:41.148
THE SYSTEM.

03:22:41.215 --> 03:22:43.484
SO MUCH THAT I AM VERY WORRIED

03:22:43.551 --> 03:22:45.553

ABOUT THE PEOPLE LEFT ON THE

03:22:49.457 --> 03:22:51.492

THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY.

03:22:53.127 --> 03:22:54.362
AND THE WORKERS WHO WILL NO

AND THEY DO THEIR HOMEWORK IF IF

03:23:23.357 --> 03:23:24.859
THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE DEALT

03:23:24.926 --> 03:23:26.127
WITH IN THE ENERGY CRISIS WE

03:23:26.193 --> 03:23:27.228
DON'T WITH ALL THESE OTHER

03:23:27.295 --> 03:23:28.930
ISSUES WE DEALT WITH WITH THE

CLEAR THE WHAT THE OTHER THING

03:23:45.947 --> 03:23:46.714
THAT HAPPENED JUST REAL QUICKLY

03:23:46.781 --> 03:23:48.416
AND SO COST SHIFTING WOULD WHERE

03:23:48.482 --> 03:23:49.951
YOU HAD THE STATE ASSETS BECAUSE

03:23:50.017 --> 03:23:51.319
THE IDEAS CHAD ASSETS IS AN

03:23:51.385 --> 03:23:52.687
ASSET NOT THAT DOESN'T YOU GET

03:23:52.753 --> 03:23:53.220
ACCUSED.

03:23:53.287 --> 03:23:54.822
BUT GET DOESN'T GET TAKEN CARE

03:23:54.889 --> 03:23:56.490
FROM AN ACCOUNTING STANDPOINT

03:23:56.557 --> 03:23:57.925
AND THAT'S HIS WHOLE POWER

03:23:57.992 --> 03:23:59.260
DIFFERENCE ADJUSTMENT AND HOW

03:23:59.327 --> 03:24:00.695
THAT ALL OF THEM IN THE HOLE

03:24:00.761 --> 03:24:02.897
JUST MISSING KAUSHIK THING WORKS.

03:24:02.964 --> 03:24:05.066
AND THAT WAS THE THING IN THE

03:24:05.132 --> 03:24:07.034
WERE [inaudible]

03:24:07.101 --> 03:24:09.303
TO PAPERS AND THEY WERE ARGUING

03:24:09.370 --> 03:24:12.506
Y. WHAT I SAID WAS WRONG AND NOW.

03:24:12.573 --> 03:24:16.711
THE REASON WHY I SUPPORTED S. B.

03:24:16.777 --> 03:24:17.311
TEN EIGHTY EIGHT YEAH WAS NOT

03:24:17.378 --> 03:24:18.746
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE

03:24:18.813 --> 03:24:20.281
UTILITIES I WAS WORRIED ABOUT

03:24:20.348 --> 03:24:21.916
THE RATE PAYERS.

03:24:21.983 --> 03:24:23.417
AND IT IS THE RATE PAYERS WHO

03:24:23.484 --> 03:24:24.452
ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THOSE

03:24:24.518 --> 03:24:26.387
STRANDED ASSETS IT IS THE RATE

03:24:26.454 --> 03:24:28.255
PAYERS WHO ARE NOT ON CCA'S WHO

03:24:28.322 --> 03:24:29.290
ARE GOING TO GET A* DEAL OUT

03:24:29.357 --> 03:24:30.791
OF THIS.

03:24:30.858 --> 03:24:31.659
AND THAT'S WHY I AM OPPOSED TO

03:24:31.726 --> 03:24:34.929
THE BILL [inaudible]

03:24:34.996 --> 03:24:39.367
ABOUT [inaudible]

03:24:39.433 --> 03:24:40.901
IT'S MURATSUCHI [inaudible]

03:24:40.968 --> 03:24:44.872
QUESTION WHAT.

YOU MENTIONED EARLIER.

03:24:47.475 --> 03:24:49.610
THE PROBLEM OF BALKANIZATION.

03:24:49.677 --> 03:24:51.946
ISN'T THIS MORE BALKANIZATION.

03:24:52.013 --> 03:24:54.815
NO I I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS AN

03:24:54.882 --> 03:24:56.484
HONOR MERE CITY I THINK WHAT IT

03:24:56.550 --> 03:24:57.652

03:25:08.996 --> 03:25:11.265
AND IS WITH THIS WILL DO IS GIVE

03:25:11.332 --> 03:25:13.534
A CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO

03:25:13.601 --> 03:25:15.102
ACTUALLY CONTROL THEIR OWN

03:25:15.169 --> 03:25:15.736
DESTINY.

03:25:15.803 --> 03:25:18.172
AND NOT JUST BE SWEPT INTO ONE

03:25:18.239 --> 03:25:20.708
PARTICULAR PROVIDER BECAUSE THEY

THIS WILL --

03:25:33.821 --> 03:25:36.424
ALLOW US ALL OUR CUSTOMERS TO

03:25:36.490 --> 03:25:38.092
HAVE TO HAVE THAT OPTION NOT

03:25:38.159 --> 03:25:39.860
JUST THOSE ONES IN THE POCKETS

03:25:39.927 --> 03:25:40.828

FREEDOM HERE.

03:26:10.458 --> 03:26:11.859
THE IDEA.

03:26:11.926 --> 03:26:13.194
THAT I I THINK I I CAN'T ANSWER

03:26:13.260 --> 03:26:14.395
THE QUESTION YOU MORE CLEARLY

03:26:14.462 --> 03:26:16.263
THAN I ALREADY DID [inaudible]

03:26:16.330 --> 03:26:19.500
TECH.

03:26:19.567 --> 03:26:22.002
WELL SENATOR WE AGAIN.

03:26:22.069 --> 03:26:23.270

THANK YOU --

03:26:25.539 --> 03:26:27.074

THAT THAT THE WORLD IS --

03:26:29.210 --> 03:26:30.111
I THINK YOU'RE VERY DIFFERENT

03:26:30.177 --> 03:26:31.812
THAN IT WAS.

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:34.548
DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS WE'VE --

03:26:34.615 --> 03:26:37.118
WE'VE MOVED TOWARD CCA'S WE'VE

03:26:37.184 --> 03:26:39.086
MOVED MOVED TOWARD CLEANER

03:26:39.153 --> 03:26:40.454
ENERGY SOLAR AND WE JUST HAD A

03:26:40.521 --> 03:26:41.989
HUGE PRESENTATION ARE ON ENERGY

03:26:42.056 --> 03:26:43.758
STORAGE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION.

03:26:43.824 --> 03:26:46.093
SO OBVIOUSLY THERE IS --

03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:48.095
READY PEOPLE MOVING DIRECTLY

03:26:48.162 --> 03:26:49.663
INTO DIFFERENT.

03:26:49.730 --> 03:26:51.665
CHOICES HARM NOW GOING BACK TO

03:26:51.732 --> 03:26:52.800
AYE THICKNESS IN THE FRAGMENTS

03:26:52.867 --> 03:26:54.301
QUESTION.

03:26:54.368 --> 03:26:56.604
WHY NOT STILL MAINTAIN A CAP?

03:26:56.670 --> 03:26:58.205
WHY COMPLETELY REMOVED THE CAP

03:26:58.272 --> 03:26:59.840
THAT CAPS SEEMS TO BE?

03:26:59.907 --> 03:27:02.243
A A SAFEGUARD IN CASE THINGS

03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:04.478
SORT OF GET.

03:27:04.545 --> 03:27:06.647
OUT OF CONTROL UPON.

03:27:06.714 --> 03:27:08.983
BECAUSE IT DOES APPEAR THAT --

03:27:09.049 --> 03:27:11.218
GIVEN THE YOUR THE THE TRAUMATIC

03:27:11.285 --> 03:27:13.087
EXPERIENCE WE WENT THROUGH.

03:27:13.154 --> 03:27:16.991
THAT MUCH OF THE STEPS OF HOME

03:27:17.057 --> 03:27:18.325
MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW AND WHEN

03:27:18.392 --> 03:27:19.927
WE TALK ABOUT SOLAR.

03:27:19.994 --> 03:27:22.730
THERE CERTAIN CERTAIN STOP GAPS

03:27:22.797 --> 03:27:24.265
AND NET METERING STOP HAVE TECH

03:27:24.331 --> 03:27:25.866
SALUTING SCOTT WHICH A BBQ.

03:27:25.933 --> 03:27:27.234
THEN THAT ONE OF ARGUMENT WOULD

03:27:27.301 --> 03:27:29.036
WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH HAVING

03:27:29.103 --> 03:27:30.571
A CAP ON CCA'S I MEAN WE'RE

03:27:30.638 --> 03:27:34.074
TALKING ABOUT MOVING LOAD FROM.

03:27:34.141 --> 03:27:36.777
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO

03:27:36.844 --> 03:27:38.712
OTHERS SO IF YOU'RE CONCERNED.

03:27:38.779 --> 03:27:39.280
WITH NEEDING A CAP DIDN'T WE

03:27:39.346 --> 03:27:43.117
SHOULD BE KAPLAN CCA'S.

03:27:43.184 --> 03:27:44.685
BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER

03:27:44.752 --> 03:27:46.120
IF THEY'RE LEAVING TO GO TO ANY

03:27:46.187 --> 03:27:48.656
S. P. OR THEY'RE LEAVING TO GO.

03:27:48.722 --> 03:27:50.858
UP TO SEE CA OR THEY'RE LEAVING

03:27:50.925 --> 03:27:52.326
THE GRID BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST

03:27:52.393 --> 03:27:53.994
BECOMING SELF SUFFICIENT WHICH A

03:27:54.061 --> 03:27:55.429
LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES ARE

03:27:55.496 --> 03:27:57.097
TODAY PEOPLE RE GOING BROWN OFF

03:27:57.164 --> 03:27:58.699
THE GROUND OFF THE GRID.

03:27:58.766 --> 03:28:00.601
SO -- I HAVE

03:28:00.668 --> 03:28:02.303
NOT HEARD ANY.

03:28:02.369 --> 03:28:05.072
OF CONCERNS FROM FROM FOLKS IN

03:28:05.139 --> 03:28:06.774
IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT SOMEHOW

03:28:06.841 --> 03:28:07.842
WE SHOULD BE.

03:28:07.908 --> 03:28:08.943
YOU KNOW CAPPING HER TO BE

03:28:09.009 --> 03:28:10.678
PROPOSING LEGISLATION OR

03:28:10.744 --> 03:28:12.146
AMENDMENTS TO CAP CCA'S.

03:28:12.213 --> 03:28:13.314
SO I JUST DON'T THINK THAT

03:28:13.380 --> 03:28:14.315
THAT'S CONSISTENT AND AND YOU

03:28:14.381 --> 03:28:16.183
KNOW WE SHOULD.

03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:20.087
WE SHOULD OPEN UP AND THAT WE

THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT IS THE

03:31:06.854 --> 03:31:08.422
BUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME

03:31:08.489 --> 03:31:10.758

03:31:28.442 --> 03:31:30.411
THAT STARTS TO HAPPEN.

03:31:30.477 --> 03:31:32.046
RIGHT WHAT WE'VE WRITTEN IN THE

03:31:32.112 --> 03:31:34.815
LAW IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA NO WAY

03:31:34.882 --> 03:31:35.616

TEMPERATURE THEY HAVE TO HAVE

03:31:36.884 --> 03:31:37.918

03:31:37.985 --> 03:31:40.087
OUT AND DROP PEOPLE NUMBER.

03:31:40.154 --> 03:31:41.588
ONE NUMBER TWO ON THE WHOLE COST

03:31:41.655 --> 03:31:45.125
SHIFTING THING THAT ALSO CREATES.

03:31:45.192 --> 03:31:46.760
A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF FACTORS

03:31:46.827 --> 03:31:48.362
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAW THEY'RE

03:31:48.429 --> 03:31:49.263

THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES.

03:32:07.648 --> 03:32:08.515
THROUGH THE EXPENSE IS BUILT IN

03:32:08.582 --> 03:32:10.684
THIS REDUNDANCY TO MAKE SURE

03:32:10.751 --> 03:32:12.653
THAT IF THERE'S A FAILURE. TO A

03:32:12.719 --> 03:32:14.421
SYSTEM BECAUSE SOMEBODY WENT OFF

03:32:14.488 --> 03:32:16.156
THE SYSTEM BUT THERE'S BOTH TIME

03:32:16.223 --> 03:32:18.425
AND MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK

03:32:18.492 --> 03:32:20.160

03:32:21.495 --> 03:32:23.797
SAVINGS. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT

03:32:23.864 --> 03:32:25.466

PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED

03:33:44.411 --> 03:33:45.846
HAVE BEEN RESOLVED ALREADY.

03:33:45.913 --> 03:33:47.114
THAT ALL THE POLICIES HAVE BEEN

03:33:47.181 --> 03:33:48.615
NAILED DOWN IN THE COST SHIFTING

03:33:48.682 --> 03:33:50.884

THE POWER COST INDIFFERENCE

03:33:58.458 --> 03:33:59.493
ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS IN FACT THE

03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:00.761
EXIT FEE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO

03:34:00.827 --> 03:34:02.396
COLLECT STRANDED COSTS.

03:34:02.462 --> 03:34:03.931
AND THERE IS Y. DISAGREEMENT

03:34:03.997 --> 03:34:05.432
THAT THE CHARGE SIMPLY DOESN'T

03:34:05.499 --> 03:34:07.234
WORK AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED.

03:34:07.301 --> 03:34:08.035
AND AND THERE'S WIDE

03:34:08.101 --> 03:34:09.102
DISAGREEMENT AS TO HOW IT SHOULD

03:34:09.169 --> 03:34:11.004
BE REFORMED.

03:34:11.071 --> 03:34:11.605
THE P. YOU SEE HASN'T RESOLVED

03:34:11.672 --> 03:34:12.773

FOR THE FUTURE.

03:34:23.116 --> 03:34:24.751
AND THEY'VE SOUNDED THE ALARM

03:34:24.818 --> 03:34:25.986
BELLS THAT WE ARE RUNNING INTO A

03:34:26.053 --> 03:34:27.254
SITUATION.

03:34:27.321 --> 03:34:28.789
WHERE THERE MAY BE A SHORTAGE OF

03:34:28.855 --> 03:34:30.958
CAPACITY WERE RESOURCE ADEQUACY

03:34:31.024 --> 03:34:32.793
NEEDS ARE NOT BEING THAT?

03:34:32.859 --> 03:34:33.760
AND WHERE THERE'S NO ONE TO

DIRECT TO COMPLY WITH THE

03:34:35.495 --> 03:34:36.597
STATE'S REQUIREMENTS AND WE LOOK

03:34:36.663 --> 03:34:38.165
AT THE EAST EASTERN MARKETS

03:34:38.232 --> 03:34:39.299
WHERE WE TELL CHOICE IS RUN

03:34:39.366 --> 03:34:40.968
RAMPANT.

03:34:41.034 --> 03:34:43.036
ON STATE COMMISSIONS HAVE VERY

03:34:43.103 --> 03:34:44.972
LITTLE OVERSIGHT AND THEY WERE

03:34:45.038 --> 03:34:47.040
VERY BIG CHALLENGES TO THE

03:34:47.107 --> 03:34:48.175
MEETING A LOT OF THEIR RESOURCE

03:34:48.242 --> 03:34:49.476
GOALS AND WE HAVE SOME.

03:34:49.543 --> 03:34:51.345
BIGGER GOALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

03:34:51.411 --> 03:34:51.778
WERE TRYING TO MEET.

03:34:51.845 --> 03:34:54.281
ON MUCH OF THIS STUFF SIMPLY

03:34:54.348 --> 03:34:56.683
HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED AND YES YES

03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:57.884
PIECE HAVE NOT DUMP THEIR

03:34:57.951 --> 03:34:59.586
CUSTOMERS BACK TO THE UTILITIES

03:34:59.653 --> 03:35:00.954
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN NO BIG

03:35:01.021 --> 03:35:02.689
PROBLEM IN WHOLESALE MARKETS.

03:35:02.756 --> 03:35:04.157
THE NEXT TIME THAT PROBLEM

03:35:04.224 --> 03:35:06.593
ARRIVES ALL BETS ARE OFF.

03:35:06.660 --> 03:35:08.762
AND IF AN E. S. P. GOES BANKRUPT

03:35:08.829 --> 03:35:10.030
AND ITS CUSTOMERS ARE PUT BACK

03:35:10.097 --> 03:35:11.632
TO THE UTILITY THERE'S NO ONE TO

03:35:11.698 --> 03:35:13.233
GO AFTER FOR THE MONEY.

03:35:13.300 --> 03:35:14.901
WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT IT'S

03:35:14.968 --> 03:35:17.471
APPROPRIATE. TO AUTHORIZE

03:35:17.537 --> 03:35:19.273
UNLIMITED RETAIL CHOICE AT THIS

03:35:19.339 --> 03:35:21.141
POINT IN TIME.

03:35:21.208 --> 03:35:21.808
WITH SO MANY UNANSWERED

03:35:21.875 --> 03:35:23.744
QUESTIONS BOTH HERE IN THE

03:35:23.810 --> 03:35:25.445
LEGISLATURE AND THE REGULATORY

03:35:25.512 --> 03:35:26.580
AGENCIES OKAY MAG HAPPEN TO

03:35:26.647 --> 03:35:29.016
CLOSE.

03:35:29.082 --> 03:35:29.950
I WILL I'LL ANSWER THAT MY

03:35:30.017 --> 03:35:31.351
CLOTHES WHAT IF WHAT BOOK A

03:35:31.418 --> 03:35:32.419
QUESTION TO THE SENATOR SODA SO

03:35:32.486 --> 03:35:33.453
MISTER FRIEDMAN MENTION AGAINST

03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:35.122
THE LAST BILL YOU HAD.

03:35:35.188 --> 03:35:36.323
HAD MORE IT ALFA RENEWABLE

03:35:36.390 --> 03:35:37.891
COMPONENT WAS THERE A REASON WHY

03:35:37.958 --> 03:35:38.592
YOU DIDN'T.

03:35:38.659 --> 03:35:40.394
ON YOUR MARKET CERTAIN PORTION

03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:42.229
FOR RENEWABLES A LOT WE DID WITH

03:35:42.296 --> 03:35:43.664
FOLLOWING THE LAW RIGHT NOW IT'S

03:35:43.730 --> 03:35:47.301
50% AND I SPACES BACK THAT S. B.

03:35:47.367 --> 03:35:48.368
ONE HUNDRED WILL PASS AND GET

03:35:48.435 --> 03:35:48.935
2100%.

03:35:49.002 --> 03:35:50.037
SO WE DID NEED TO HANDLE IT

03:35:50.103 --> 03:35:51.071
SEPARATELY IT'S GOING TO BE

03:35:51.138 --> 03:35:52.639
HANDLED IN THE SHIFT TO POLICY

03:35:52.706 --> 03:35:54.374
QUITE SO WE THINK THINK ON IT I

03:35:54.441 --> 03:35:55.242
CAN CLOTHES.

03:35:55.309 --> 03:35:56.677
YOUR INCIDENT OF HIS QUESTIONS I

03:35:56.743 --> 03:35:58.345
GUESS WHAT I COULD ANSWER THE

03:35:58.412 --> 03:36:03.083
TWO QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED

03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:03.583
IF YOU JUST HOPE REPORT

03:36:03.650 --> 03:36:04.685
MOMENTOUS.

03:36:04.751 --> 03:36:06.687
MAKE SURE THAT WE SCALE YOU HAVE.

03:36:06.753 --> 03:36:07.487
YOU JUST VERY BRIEFLY --

03:36:07.554 --> 03:36:08.288
YOU KNOW I I THINK WHAT.

03:36:08.355 --> 03:36:08.922
WE'RE SEEING IN THIS DISCUSSION

03:36:08.989 --> 03:36:10.257
IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT

03:36:10.324 --> 03:36:11.325
YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A LOT OF

03:36:11.391 --> 03:36:13.060
CONSISTENCY TO OUR OVERALL

03:36:13.126 --> 03:36:14.795
ENERGY PLAN IT SEEMS LIKE YOU

03:36:14.861 --> 03:36:16.029
KNOW ME ON THE ONE HAND WE WANT

03:36:16.096 --> 03:36:17.230
TO HAVE MORE MORE PEOPLE WOULD.

03:36:17.297 --> 03:36:17.998
COME TO GET OFF THE GRID SO TO

03:36:18.065 --> 03:36:20.334
SPEAK -- BUT

03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:21.201
ON THE OTHER HAND WE'RE SAYING

03:36:21.268 --> 03:36:22.169
NO WHAT WE NEED PEOPLE ON THE

03:36:22.235 --> 03:36:23.870
GROUP WE NEED AND IN FACT WE

03:36:23.937 --> 03:36:26.206
NEED REGIONALIZATION RAY AND WE

03:36:26.273 --> 03:36:27.040
NEED OTHER POWER SOURCES FROM

03:36:27.107 --> 03:36:28.175
OTHER.

03:36:28.241 --> 03:36:29.176
YOU KNOW OTHER WESTERN STATES

03:36:29.242 --> 03:36:30.744
YOU KNOW I'M [inaudible]

03:36:30.811 --> 03:36:33.380
AND AND IT WILL YOU KNOW ONE

03:36:33.447 --> 03:36:34.648
THING ON THIS I MEAN CERTAINLY A

03:36:34.715 --> 03:36:37.851
LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT.

03:36:37.918 --> 03:36:39.119
YOU KNOW THAT --

03:36:39.186 --> 03:36:40.320
THAT EMPLOY.

03:36:40.387 --> 03:36:41.922
PEOPLE IN OUR DISTRICTS WANNA

03:36:41.988 --> 03:36:43.557
TAKE ADVANTAGE THIS IS NO WONDER.

03:36:43.623 --> 03:36:46.493
THE OTHER COSTS ARE 89% HIGHER.

03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:48.061
THAN ANY OTHER STATE YOU KNOW

03:36:48.128 --> 03:36:48.895
WHEN THEY'RE DOING COMMERCIAL

03:36:48.962 --> 03:36:50.330
INDUSTRIAL PRICING SO OF COURSE

03:36:50.397 --> 03:36:51.365
THEY WANNA.

03:36:51.431 --> 03:36:52.399
BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

03:36:52.466 --> 03:36:54.167
THIS AND THAT REALLY ALL GOES

03:36:54.234 --> 03:36:55.502
BACK -- TO

03:36:55.569 --> 03:36:57.537
OUR PS RIGHT IS WHAT IS REALLY

03:36:57.604 --> 03:36:59.606
DRIVEN UP THE COST YOU KNOW FOR

03:36:59.673 --> 03:37:01.274
A LOT OF THESE --

03:37:01.341 --> 03:37:02.709
BUSINESSES AND SO BUT WITH THE

03:37:02.776 --> 03:37:04.511
SAME TIME WE ALSO.

03:37:04.578 --> 03:37:06.012
MAYBE WE DON'T REALIZATION WHERE

03:37:06.079 --> 03:37:08.048
WE TAKE NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES --

03:37:08.115 --> 03:37:10.951
TO POWER. TO PROVIDE THAT THAT

03:37:11.017 --> 03:37:12.052
POWER RIGHT SO I MEAN THERE'S

03:37:12.119 --> 03:37:12.719
JUST.

03:37:12.786 --> 03:37:13.854
IT IN ON THE SAME TIME WE TALK

03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:15.188
ABOUT CCA'S WE TALK ABOUT MICRO

03:37:15.255 --> 03:37:17.524
GRIDS.

03:37:17.591 --> 03:37:19.359
YOU KNOW WHAT I GUESS ONE OF THE

03:37:19.426 --> 03:37:20.127
THINGS IS THAT WE NEED TO GET

03:37:20.193 --> 03:37:21.495
OUT I'D I AM GOING TO SUPPORT

03:37:21.561 --> 03:37:22.896
THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK.

03:37:22.963 --> 03:37:24.064
WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE THIS AND

03:37:24.131 --> 03:37:26.066
AND AND AND GIVE PEOPLE THE

03:37:26.133 --> 03:37:26.700
ABILITY BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE

03:37:26.767 --> 03:37:27.968
STRAW THAT BREAKING THE CAMEL'S

03:37:28.034 --> 03:37:29.202
BACK RIGHT I MEAN THAT THERE'S

03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:30.437
SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

03:37:30.504 --> 03:37:31.138
CAUSING.

03:37:31.204 --> 03:37:34.174
THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IN AND

03:37:34.241 --> 03:37:36.109
RISE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH.

03:37:36.176 --> 03:37:37.677
AND THIS IS REALLY A VERY SMALL

03:37:37.744 --> 03:37:39.112
THING.

03:37:39.179 --> 03:37:41.047
AND THEN A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF

03:37:41.114 --> 03:37:43.417
PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY EVEN.

03:37:43.483 --> 03:37:44.551
FLAT AS AS IN TERMS OF OVERALL

03:37:44.618 --> 03:37:45.752
CUSTOMERS THAT ARE TAKING

03:37:45.819 --> 03:37:47.387
ADVANTAGE OF THIS PARTICULAR

03:37:47.454 --> 03:37:49.055
DIRECT ACCESS RIGHT --

03:37:49.122 --> 03:37:51.224
SO.

03:37:51.291 --> 03:37:52.559
DEFTLY ON LONG TERM WE NEED TO

03:37:52.626 --> 03:37:53.827
HAVE A BETTER MORE CONSISTENT

03:37:53.894 --> 03:37:54.995
PLAN OF HOW WE GONNA MAKE THIS

03:37:55.061 --> 03:37:57.197
ALL WORK --

03:37:57.264 --> 03:37:58.498
WE ALL WANT DIFFERENT THINGS IN

03:37:58.565 --> 03:38:00.000
ALL OF US ARE HAPPY ABOUT

03:38:00.066 --> 03:38:01.768
CERTAIN ASPECTS AND NOT OTHERS.

03:38:01.835 --> 03:38:02.869
BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A

03:38:02.936 --> 03:38:04.971
COHESIVE PLAN I THINK THAT'S

03:38:05.038 --> 03:38:05.505
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

03:38:05.572 --> 03:38:06.139
CONTINUE.

03:38:06.206 --> 03:38:07.107
TO THAT HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO

03:38:07.174 --> 03:38:08.742
WORK ON BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE

03:38:08.809 --> 03:38:10.377
HAS TO BE A LONG TERM MORE

03:38:10.444 --> 03:38:12.312
CONCLUSIVE CONSISTENT.

03:38:12.379 --> 03:38:14.347
PLAN FOR OUR ENERGY NEEDS.

03:38:14.414 --> 03:38:15.382
IN THE FUTURE.

03:38:15.449 --> 03:38:16.750
THAT I DON'T THINK ANYONE

03:38:16.817 --> 03:38:18.251
DISAGREES WITH THAT AND SENATOR

03:38:18.318 --> 03:38:19.786
WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION

03:38:19.853 --> 03:38:22.656
TODAY I WON'T REPEAT THE THE THE

03:38:22.722 --> 03:38:24.357
THE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE

03:38:24.424 --> 03:38:25.659
ABOUT THE BILL THERE'S NO

03:38:25.725 --> 03:38:27.694
RECOMMENDATION I AM VOTING NO

03:38:27.761 --> 03:38:29.229
BUT PLEASE THIS IS OUR

03:38:29.296 --> 03:38:31.264
OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE.

03:38:31.331 --> 03:38:33.300
I HAVE BY.

03:38:33.366 --> 03:38:35.869
TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

03:38:35.936 --> 03:38:37.137
OR THE ENERGY COMMITTEE AND BEEN

03:38:37.204 --> 03:38:39.806
INVOLVED IN A I KNOW HOW MANY

03:38:39.873 --> 03:38:41.208
ENERGY RELATED ISSUES OVER THE

03:38:41.274 --> 03:38:43.443
YEARS.

03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:44.911
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.

03:38:44.978 --> 03:38:46.446
THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

03:38:46.513 --> 03:38:48.949
COMMISSION DID NOT SHOW UP.

03:38:49.015 --> 03:38:52.219
SUPPORT OPPOSE WORD VICE.

03:38:52.285 --> 03:39:01.728
SO WHEN THE ARGUMENTS MADE AGAIN

03:39:01.795 --> 03:39:02.028
[inaudible]

03:39:02.095 --> 03:39:05.465
SCOTT. TO POST A BOND.

03:39:05.532 --> 03:39:07.868
AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM UNLIKE

03:39:07.934 --> 03:39:09.336
WHAT WE HAD BEFORE THERE ARE

03:39:09.402 --> 03:39:11.137
SIGNIFICANT EARLY WARNING

03:39:11.204 --> 03:39:13.340
SYSTEMS IN PLACE.

03:39:13.406 --> 03:39:15.375
SO WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO. ONE

03:39:15.442 --> 03:39:17.444
OF THE REASONS I DECIDED TO COME

03:39:17.511 --> 03:39:18.578
BACK TO GOVERNMENT AFTER WORKING

03:39:18.645 --> 03:39:20.614
IN RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR TWELVE

03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:22.082
YEARS AFTER LEAVING GOVERNMENT.

03:39:22.148 --> 03:39:24.784
WAS TO MOVE AWAY FROM.

03:39:24.851 --> 03:39:27.787
THE BROAD DISCUSSIONS OF LET'S

03:39:27.854 --> 03:39:29.689
HAVE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

03:39:29.756 --> 03:39:31.658
STANDARDS ARE LET'S GO GREEN AND

03:39:31.725 --> 03:39:32.893
HAVE A LOT OF PRESS CONFERENCES

03:39:32.959 --> 03:39:34.694
AND TO GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY

03:39:34.761 --> 03:39:36.363
OF HOW DO WE DO IT. TO ASK THE

03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:39.499
HARD QUESTIONS AT EVERY LEVEL TO

03:39:39.566 --> 03:39:41.735
MAKE SURE THE PROCESS AND NOT TO

03:39:41.801 --> 03:39:43.470
BE INTIMIDATED BY WHAT HAPPENED

03:39:43.537 --> 03:39:45.438
BEFORE TO LEARN FROM WHAT WE

03:39:45.505 --> 03:39:46.506
LEARNED BEFORE AND THEY GET IT

03:39:46.573 --> 03:39:48.775
RIGHT.

03:39:48.842 --> 03:39:49.743
HOW WE GONNA GET IT RIGHT NO ONE

03:39:49.809 --> 03:39:50.810
CAN GUARANTEE HAVE BEEN TO A FEW

03:39:50.877 --> 03:39:52.379
PERFECT STORMS IN MY LIFE?

03:39:52.445 --> 03:39:54.014
BUT I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE IS

03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:54.848
IN THE BALANCE OF THINGS

03:39:54.915 --> 03:39:56.616
PARTICULAR ENERGY COSTS ARE SO

03:39:56.683 --> 03:39:59.119
HIGH WERE OPPORTUNITIES ARE SO

03:39:59.185 --> 03:39:59.920
GREAT.

03:39:59.986 --> 03:40:01.021
WHERE COMPANIES ARE SO

03:40:01.087 --> 03:40:02.556
SOPHISTICATED WERE OF THE

03:40:02.622 --> 03:40:04.457
FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES I

03:40:04.524 --> 03:40:06.226
THINK FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO

03:40:06.293 --> 03:40:06.960
HALVES CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY

03:40:07.027 --> 03:40:09.429
OFFICERS WHERE THE ENTIRE

03:40:09.496 --> 03:40:10.997
CORPORATE STRUCTURE OF BIG COSTA

03:40:11.064 --> 03:40:12.999
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED?

03:40:13.066 --> 03:40:14.734
AND WE HAVE WON THE WAR.

03:40:14.801 --> 03:40:16.469
WE HAVE WON THE WAR.

03:40:16.536 --> 03:40:18.405
IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL THINKING

03:40:18.471 --> 03:40:19.806
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT

03:40:19.873 --> 03:40:21.675
SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT HOW THEY BY

03:40:21.741 --> 03:40:23.376
POWER AND ABOUT HOW THEY DO DO

03:40:23.443 --> 03:40:24.611
THIS KIND OF THING.

03:40:24.678 --> 03:40:26.613
THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE IT WAS

03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:28.648
THE WILD WEST THERE WERE A FEW

03:40:28.715 --> 03:40:30.150
COMPANIES WHO ARE BOTTOM FEEDERS

03:40:30.216 --> 03:40:32.319
WHO CAME IN AND PROMISE THE MOON

03:40:32.385 --> 03:40:33.987
I WATCHED IT HAPPEN IN LOS

03:40:34.054 --> 03:40:35.622
ANGELES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

03:40:35.689 --> 03:40:37.123
SAYING WE'RE GONNA MAKE ALL THIS
