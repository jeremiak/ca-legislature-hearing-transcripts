ORGANIZATION -- AND WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. FIRST LET ME THANK MY COLLEAGUE CHAIRMAN BROADER GARCIA FIRST PARTNERSHIP IN ORGANIZING THIS HEARING. I APPRECIATE ALL OF HIS LEADERSHIP IN THE WORK OF THE STAFF. UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS BEEN A REBOUND HERE FOR CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY BUT THE ABUNDANCE OF WATER ALSO CARRIES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK. A FEW WEEKS AGO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS AND NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. METEOROLOGIST AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FLIGHT OPERATIONS CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IT WAS NOT FOR TO TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR STATE AND FEDERAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT TEAM AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED BY A FLOOD EMERGENCY. WHILE THE SIERRAS WERE INUNDATED WITH THE RECORD NUMBER OF ATMOSPHERIC RIVER. EVENTS THIS YEAR WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE SHORT TERM AND SEVERE DROUGHTS IN THE LONG TERM. FOR FAR TOO LONG CALIFORNIA HAS NOT HAD A REAL WATER PLAN REAL PLANS REQUIRE REAL DECISIONS IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. HAVE REFUSED TO TAKE ON THIS TOUGH ISSUE. CALIFORNIA'S AGING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS PAID THE PRICE. THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED ASSEMBLY BILL SIX THIRTY EIGHT EARLY THIS YEAR TO FORCE THE STATE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE VERY REAL IMPACTS THE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HAVE ON OUR DAMS CANALS. AQUEDUCTS AND LEVEES. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM IS COMPLEX AND LOCAL FEDERAL STATE AGENCIES HAVE DEVELOPED A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL STRUCTURES TO REGULATE FLOOD FLOWS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DECLARED A FEDERAL DISASTER AREA AT LEAST ONCE FOR A FLOODING ABOUT. MORE THAN SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE ON STRUCTURES VALUED AT NEARLY SIX HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE ARE LOCATED IN AN AREA WITH A ONE IN FIVE HUNDRED PROBABILITY OF FLOODING. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALONE NEARLY ONE THREE RESIDENTS IN CROPS WORTH NEARLY SIX BILLION ARE LOCATED IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR FLOOD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THE REST TO LIVES AND PROPERTY IT IS IMPORTANT WE INSURE ARMORED SHE PLANS A ROBUST AND UP TO DATE. I IS THE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE MOST CURRENT RESTS AND INCORPORATE THE BEST FOR CASTING TECHNOLOGIES. WHEN IT COMES TO FLOOD MANAGEMENT WE ALSO NEED TO FULLY CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES FLOODING HAS OUR LIFELINE SYSTEMS SUCH AS FUEL POWER COMMUNICATIONS DRINKING WATER? AND CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO'S HERE -- PRINT AND THE PRESENTERS FOR TAKING TIME TO PARTICIPATE -- IN TODAY'S HEARING. THIS TIME ALL TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE -- EDUARDO GARCIA FOR ANY OPENING COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND EVERYONE WHO IS JOINING US THIS MORNING I WANT -- TO JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR EFFORT IN REACHING OUT TO OUR COMMITTEE TO PUTTING THIS. A HEARING TOGETHER IT'S ALL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE FOREFRONT -- I ALSO WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING. OF FOR THIS CONVERSATION AS WE KNOW -- WE HAVE BEEN FACED WITH TREMENDOUS -- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT -- RAISE THE CONCERNS OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AS A STATE -- NOT ONLY TO REACT BUT ALSO TO TRY TO BE PROACTIVE. ON THIS MATTER -- I'M HOPING THAT WE GET A GOOD. CONVERSATION GOING WITH OUR PANELISTS. AND I THINK THE FIRST ONE SETS THE TONE. FOR US TO SEE WHERE OUR RESOURCES ARE BEING INVESTED -- TO ADDRESSES ISSUES SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION. OKAY WITH THAT WE WILL -- INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL. TO THE TO UP FRONT. WE HAVE WITH US MEMBERS -- PRINCIPLE FISCAL POLICY AND SMELLY RO AS WELL AS CHIEF OF HYDROLOGY FIGHTER IF OPERATIONS OFFICE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING I'M RACHEL EHLERS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING -- THE SERGEANTS JUST PASS OUT THE HANDOUT FROM WHICH I'LL SPEAK IT'S ALSO POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE LA -- DOT CA DOT GOV AND WILL BE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE -- AS WELL SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S FIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM -- ALSO TOUCH ON FUNDING AND HAVE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND THE SYSTEM AND THEN -- DEFERRED TO SUBSEQUENT PANELS TO GET INTO THE DETAILS AND ALSO HAD TO TALK ABOUT. EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH MOST OF MY PRESENTATION COMES FROM A REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE PUT OUT. IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT'S KIND OF A PRIMER ON FLOOD MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE LEFT A STACK OF THEM WITH STAFF -- IF ANY MEMBERS ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE AND THAT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL. SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE THIS IS JUST A VISUAL OF OF WHAT CHAIRMAN GREAT ALREADY DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF OUR FLOOD RISK ACROSS THE STATE -- BOTH IN TERMS OF RESIDENTS SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN -- THE FIVE HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD RISK AREA THAT MEANS THERE'S A ONE IN FIVE HUNDRED CHANCE OF A FLOOD HAPPENING IN A GIVEN YEAR -- US -- BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STRUCTURES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CROP VALUE. AND I THINK EVEN THESE DATA WHICH COME FROM A REPORT THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AREPROBABLY UNDERSTATING THE RISK BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT IT. TOTALLY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE WETTER WIND. STORMS SNOW MELT POTENTIALLY MEANT MELTING EARLIER SOME OF THE PREDICTIONS OF OF SOME OF THE CHANGES WILL SEE -- BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THERE'S CLEARLY HAVE QUITE A BIT OF RISK ACROSS THE STATE. TURNING TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT THIS JUST HIGHLIGHTS THAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY SHARED ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT FOR ADDRESSING FLOOD MANAGEMENT -- THE FRONT LINES ARE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THOSE ARE ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE SOME ORGANIZATIONS -- TASK TASK THOSE RESPONSIBLE IS TO CITIES TO COUNTIES AND SOME TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS -- THOSE FRONTLINE AGENCIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTING MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING THEIR LEVEES AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES DEVELOPING LAND USE POLICIES. PLANNING AND LEADING EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND THEN GENERATING A LOT OF THE FUNDING THAT'S USED FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE ARE TWO MAIN AGENCIES INVOLVED THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND FEMA THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY. I HAVE THE THE US ARMY CORPS GENERALLY IS CONSTRUCTING SOME LARGE PROJECTS AND THEN TURNING OVER THE DAILY OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE TO THEIR NON FEDERAL SPONSORS TO PART PARTNERS EITHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OUR STATE AGENCY LEVEL -- BUT THEY DO TYPICALLY MAINTAIN REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THOSE STRUCTURES CAM INCLUDING SETTING STANDARDS. AND THEY WILL COME IN AND REPAIR FLOOD DAMAGE LEVEES BUT ONLY FOR THOSE LEVEES HAVE MET CERTAIN STANDARDS AND I THINK YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR ABOUT THAT AND SUBSEQUENT. PANELS -- FEMA COMES IN IF THERE ARE EMERGENCIES AND ALSO OPERATES THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THEN AT THE STATE LEVEL AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM ALL OF THESE AGENCIES TODAY. I DID HAVE YOU ARE IS OUR LEAD AGENCY IN FLOOD RELATED PREPARATIONS FOR CASTING AND RESPONSE AND ALSO HAS RESPONSIBILITIES OVER -- THAT CENTRAL VALLEY. FLOOD SYSTEM OVER WHICH THE STATE HAS SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES KNOWN AS THE STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL OF TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL IN A MOMENT -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD OVERSEAS AND REGULATES THAT SYSTEM AND THEN -- THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HELPS IN RESPONDING TO AND PREPARING FOR FLOOD DISASTERS. SO TURNING TO PAGE. THREE MOST OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS LOCALLY OWNED AND MANAGED -- ALTHOUGH THE STATE DOES HAVE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OVER AT THIS STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM. AND I'VE GOT HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE FOUR YOU CAN SEE A MAP THAT OUTLINES WHERE WHAT THAT STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IN WHICH WHERE THOSE LEVEES ARE. AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE MOSTLY ALONG THE MAIN STEM OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER IF YOU LOOK AT THE DELTA THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAP YOU CAN SEE THERE AREN'T A LOT MANY. STATE RESPONSIBILITY LEVEES WITHIN THAT SYSTEM SO IT'S MOSTLY ON THE MAIN STEM BUT BUT THERE ARE SOME PATCHWORK SURROUND OTHER PARTS OF IT -- I CAN DEFERRED A SUBSEQUENT PANELS TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM CAME ABOUT BUT THE IN THE OVERVIEW IS THAT. WHILE MOST OF THESE LEVEES WERE ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY PRIVATE CITIZENS PUSHING SAND AND SOILS TOGETHER DURING THE GOLD RUSH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEN CAME IN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS AND AND HELPED -- DEVELOP THEM IN THIS PROJECT AND THEN THE STATE TOOK OVER RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MID FIFTIES AND GIVE ASSURANCES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE AS THE STATE WOULD. BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THIS SYSTEM AND THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT LAWSUIT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE TURNOVER SCAB VERSUS CALIFORNIA COURT DECISION. THAT REALLY ESTABLISHED -- THAT THE STATE HAS SPECIALIZED THAT LADY OVER THESE SYSTEMS. YOU DRIVE A LITTLE DEEPER TO EXPLAIN WHY -- WHAT THE PROMISE LAWSUIT ONCE? WELL AND I MAY DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE MORE EXPERTISE ON THIS BUT I'LL I'LL I'LL GIVE THEM A SHOT AND THEN AND THEN PERHAPS TURNED OVER IF THAT'S ALRIGHT -- BUT THERE WAS A LEVEE FAILURE THERE AND THERE WAS A COURT DECISION THAT FOUND THAT IT WAS THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH. THE LEVEES HAD NEVER BEEN UP TO IN MODERN ENGINEERING STANDARDS THE COURT STILL FOUND THAT THE STATE KNEW THAT AND THEN THEREFORE HAD SOME RESPONSIBILITY -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE IN OPERATIONAL. FOR ANYTHING THAT I GOT THE THUMBS UP THAT COVERAGE -- SO. THAT DID ESTABLISH THIS STATE LIABILITY FOR MAINTAINING THIS THIS SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE STATE HAS THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY WE HAVE IS TO ESTABLISH MAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS AND AGREEMENTS WITH AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE TO DO THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OVER THOSE SYSTEMS -- AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME OF FROM ONE OF THOSE AGENCIES LATER AND YOUR PANEL AS WELL. SO EVEN THOUGH WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THESE STRUCTURES -- TO CONTROL FLOOD WATERS THERE ARE ALSO OTHER -- APPROACHES THAT THE STATE CAN TAKE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TAKE TO MANAGE FLOOD WATERS -- WHICH INCLUDE. ACTUALLY LETTING THE WATER FLOW AND CREATING WIDER AND AND BROADER AREAS FOR THE FLOOD WATERS TO SLOW TO SPREAD TO SYNC. AND WE FOUND THAT THAT HAS A LOT OF OTHER BENEFITS IT CAN BENEFIT FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT AND ALSO -- EVEN WATER SUPPLY WHEN IT REPLENISHES GROUNDWATER -- UP THE FIRST SO THAT'S BEEN A REALLY MAJOR PUSH OF THE STATE IN RECENT YEARS AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT SOME FROM SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS AS WELL. TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS FOR TRYING TO MANAGE OUR FLOOD WATERS. SO SKIPPING OVER PASSED THE MAP TO PAGE FIVE TALKING ABOUT FUNDING FOR A MOMENT THERE ARE WIDE RANGES OF ESTIMATES ON HOW MUCH IS SPENT ANNUALLY ON FLOOD MANAGEMENT -- ACROSS THE STATE ESTIMATES RANGE BETWEEN TWO IN THREE BILLION DOLLARS AS IS TRUE WITH MOST WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE MOST OF THIS IS FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND MOST OF THAT THAT LARGEST SOURCES PROPERTY TAXES AND POPERTY ASSESSMENTS BUT THEIR LOCAL LOCALS GENERATE FUNDS IN VARIOUS FORMS. THERE IS SOME FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL ESTIMATES ARE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY THE LARGEST PIECE OF THAT COMES IN THOSE LARGE PROJECTS THAT THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS CONSTRUCTS -- THERE'S ALSO SPENDING FOR DISASTER RESPONSE AND THEN FROM THE STATE THE LARGEST SOURCES BOND FUNDS YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THE CHART AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- FIVE SOME OF THEIR RECENT ACROSS THE LAST TWO DECADES BONDS THAT HAVE PROVIDED. FOR FIVE POINT SIX BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT TYPE OF ACTIVITIES THESE FUNDS ARE STILL BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE MORE RECENT ONES. IN ADDITION TO BONDS ARE ALSO SOMETIMES IS GENERAL FUND PROVIDED FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT -- AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE MOST RECENT BUDGET. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUT PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR MATCHING FUNDS FOR TO SOME LARGE FEDERAL PROJECTS A HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON LEVEES IN THAT STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM. AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR INCREASED MAINTENANCE FOR A DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ON THAT SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE SIX JUST HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS IN YOUR SUBSEQUENT PANELS AS WELL. FIRST BEING THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS OLD -- ARE LEVEES MANY OF OUR LEVEES ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWO YEARS OLD AND WERE NOT DESIGNED ACCORDING TO MODERN DESIGN STANDARDS EVEN IN THE FIRST PLACE WE SAW. THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAPPENED OR A BILL DAM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT SHOW BOTH -- THE RISK OF SOME OF OUR EXISTING AGING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO ARE CRITICAL DEPENDENCE ON IT. AND NOT ONLY THIS INFRASTRUCTURE ALL BUT WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED IT DIDN'T WASN'T NECESSARILY DESIGNED FOR THE TYPES OF GOALS AND CONDITIONS THAT WE FACE TODAY. A LOT OF THE ORIGINAL GOALS OF THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WAS GETTING THE WATER OUT TO THE SEA AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND NOW WE KNOW THAT. THAT HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON FISH AND WILDLIFE AND ALSO EVEN ON ON WATER SUPPLY IN SOME CASES SO TRYING TO RE ENVISION HOW WE HANDLE FLOOD WATERS TO ACHIEVE OTHER BENEFITS -- WE'VE OUTSIDE A LOT OF POPULATION GROWTH FOR FACING CHANGING CLIMATE SO A LOT OF A LOT OF CHANGING FACTORS THAT HAVE COME INTO PLAY SINCE THAT FLOOD INFRASTRUCTURE WAS DEVELOPED -- THIRD OUR NEEDS ARE GREAT BUT FUNDING IS LIMITED AND WE HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES HERE OF SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS ON ON GENERATING FUNDING FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT. LAND USE COMES INTO PLAY ESPECIALLY THE GROWING POPULATION AND WHERE THAT DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS. AND THEN FINALLY I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT TODAY IS THERE ARE SO MANY AGENCIES INVOLVED IN FLOOD MANAGEMENT DECISIONS THAT A LOT OF TIMES COORDINATING ACROSS THOSE AGENCIES FOR PERMITTING FOR FUNDING FOR TIMING. CAN CREATE CHALLENGES AS WELL SO HOPEFULLY THAT PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE DISCUSSION YOU HAVE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTER WILL HOLD QUESTION AFTER THE THE FINAL PRESENTER FOR THE SPANISH. YEAH THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GRAY CHAIRMAN GARCIA MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE MY NAME IS JOHN PASH. AND THE PRINCIPAL CIVIL ENGINEERING CHIEF OF THE HYDROLOGY IN FLIGHT OPERATIONS OFFICE FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THE WATER RESOURCES -- I OVERSEE THE FOOT OPERATIONS SNOW PACK AND RIVER FORECASTING REGIONAL EMERGENCY FLOOD EMERGENCY PLANNING. AND THE STATE FEDERAL FOR OPERATIONS CENTER AND THE CALIFORNIA DATA EXCHANGE CENTER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT THE BSN ABOUT RESOURCE AMERICANS NEARING FROM CAL POLY SAN LUIS IN A MASTERS OF SCIENCE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING FROM TEXAS A AND M. UNIVERSITY. AND I'LL JUMP IN HERE. GET A CHAIRMAN'S GARCIA AND GRAY MY NAME IS MIKE MYERS WHY I'M ALSO CIVIL ENGINEER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES I CURRENTLY WORK WITH THE TO BE OURS EXECUTIVE VISION. I REPORT TO ERIKO BECAUSE OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT DAM SAFETY WHO HAS JOINED US HERE TODAY. SO WANTED. TO CALL ATTENTION TO THAT. I MY EXPERTISE AND REMEMBER ALL THE DEPARTMENTS BY TECHNICAL AND POLICY ADVICE TO A NUMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION OF VARIOUS WATER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. I AM CURRENTLY LEADING THE DVR'S CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS IN SUPPORT OF PROPOSITION ONE THE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. AND PREVIOUSLY I WAS THE LEAD FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CENTER FIVE THE PROTECTION PLAN. WHICH I'M HOPING WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF THE SECOND PANEL HERE TODAY -- IN MY BACHELOR'S IN CIVIL ENGINEERING FROM TEXAS A AND M. UNIVERSITY WE HAVE TO AYE HE'S HERE TODAY. AND THEN I CAME TO CALIFORNIA TO GET MY MASTERS OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AT UC DAVIS. WE HAVE HAND OUTS FOR YOU -- WILL BE ALSO WALKING THROUGH THE POSTERS AND CALL ATTENTION TO WHICH POSTER WILL BE WORKING THROUGH -- THESE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU AFTER AS WELL SO YOU SHOULD HAVE THE NOW BUT IF YOU NEED MORE COPIES -- THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND START WITH OUR FIRST HAND OUT HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED THE STAIR STEP OR MANAGING RESIDUAL RISK GRAPHIC THIS IS ADAPTED FROM A DOCUMENT THAT FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN USING FOR DECADES TO DESCRIBE. WHAT WE DO FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TO BUY DOWN RISK THE KEY POINTS HERE IS THAT THERE IS ALWAYS FLOOD RISK IT'S A MISNOMER THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY ELIMINATE OR CONTROL FLOOD WATERS? THE THE THE GOAL OF ALL AGENCIES IS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS TO BUY DOWN THOSE RISKS THROUGH PORTFOLIOS OF ACTIONS THAT INCLUDE ACTUAL STRUCTURAL ACTIONS. AS WELL AS WHAT WE WOULD CALL MANAGEMENT OR NONSTRUCTURAL ACTIONS THERE ARE A HOST OF THOSE THINGS INCLUDING BUILDING DAMS RESERVOIRS -- BUILDING A CONSTRUCTING AND MAINTAINING LEVEES HAVING FORECASTING PROGRAMS COORDINATING ENSURING THE INFORMATION FROM THOSE FORECASTING PROGRAMS. HAVING FLOOD INSURANCE -- AS A MEANS TO PROTECT PRIVATE CITIZENS -- ZONING AND BUILDING CODES WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE PEOPLE AWAY FROM HARM. AND THEN -- ALSO IN THERE IS TRAINING IN BUILDING EXERCISES SO THAT WHEN A FLOOD EVENT HAPPENS THE RESPOND AS WELL AS LOCAL COMMUNITIES KNOW WHAT THEY CAN GO THROUGH AND DO -- IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- JUST SOME NUMBERS OUT THERE THEY'RE OVER TWELVE HUNDRED REGULATORY DAMS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- MOST OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE SMALL THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A DEDICATED FLOOD CONTROL OPERATION OR DESIGN WITHIN THEM BUT THEY DO POSE SOME ADDITIONAL RISK OUT THERE THERE'S ADDITIONALLY FOR COORDINATION -- THERE OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND MILES OF LEVEES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED OF WHICH THE STATE ACTUALLY MAINTAINS AND OWNS THE MAJORITY OF THESE ARE LOCALLY MAINTAINED AND THERE OVER A THOUSAND DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITH WATER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT OVERLAP INTO FLOOD MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND THE LARGEST ROLE THE STATE HAS ACTUALLY IS IMPROVING THE LOCAL CAPACITY TO REDUCE FLOOD RISK IN BY IT DOWN OVER TIME. AND THE PRIMARY MEANS OF DOING THIS IS EFFECTIVELY COORDINATION AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATION AND THEN BUILDING THROUGH EXERCISES AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. THAT LOCAL CAPACITY TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO FLOOD EVENTS HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS NOT GOT INTO THIS BROADER GOAL OF ACTUALLY GOING IN ACTIVELY MANAGING THE FLOODS OUT THERE BECAUSE OF THE EXPANSIVE THE STATE ITSELF IS SO LARGER BE COSTLY TO MOVE. PEOPLE IN PERSONAL OUT THERE. I THANK MIKE. X. WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH -- MORE IN DEPTH OVERVIEW OF THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM -- THAT RITUAL AT A ALLUDED TO EARLIER AND SO IF YOU LOOK TO THE NEXT FIGURE -- HARMS IS UPSIDE DOWN AFTER -- SO THE FIGURE ON THE TOP OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT AND IN THE FIGURE ON THE BOTTOM IS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT. AND WITHIN THESE TWO PROJECTS OTHERS OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE FLOOD PLAINS EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS WITH THE PROPERTY AND ASSETS THAT ARE AT RISK. FIVE MAJOR URBAN CENTERS AND DOZENS ABOUT FORTY PLUS SMALL COMMUNITY CENTER. AND END DOZENS OF ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT ARE -- PROTECTED BY THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM. AND THE THIRD ARE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM AND THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEM OF A SACRAMENTO SYSTEM IS RAIN DRIVEN. WHERE THE SAME WORKING SYSTEM IS MORE SNOW MELT DRIVEN AS WAS A SHARED AT THE IF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE? HAPPENED THE NORTHERN SIERRA YOU CAN EXPECT ABOUT FIFTY INTO THE PRECIP ON AVERAGE PER YEAR RESIDENTS SOUTHERN SIERRA AS YOU'D EXPECT ABOUT THIRTY INCHES A PRESET PER YEAR. AND CALIFORNIA RECEIVED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TOTAL PRECIPITATION FROM THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAIN RANGE -- GOING THROUGH UP THE BIG PIECE OF THE THE CITY GETS A SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS WE HAVE THE RESERVOIR THE RESERVOIR SYSTEMS AND AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM YOU GOT THE OROVILLE DAM FOLSOM DAM. SHASTA IS OUT OF THE RANGE OF THIS GRAPHIC BUT THOSE ARE A MAJOR PIECE OF THE FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT. WHEN MANAGING IT IS A SYSTEM IN ON THE SAN JOAQUIN SIDE YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF? RESERVOIRS -- ON THE ON THE MCCALL ONLY CALAVERAS STANISLAUS WOLLEMI MERCED RIVER'S AS WELL THE CHURCHILL AND FRESNO RIVER AND THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER AND THE KINGS RIVER. THERE'S A LOT OF RESERVOIRS THAT ARE MANAGING FLOOD WATERS -- IN BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SYSTEMS IS A SACRAMENTO SYSTEM HAS MORE GREAT CHANGED STEEPER SLOPES MOVE WATER FASTER. THE SAME WORKING SYSTEM IS MUCH FLATTER. THAT CREATES A DIFFERENCE IN HOW YOU HOW YOU APPROACH THE THE CHALLENGE OF FLOOD CONTROL AND IN THE SACRAMENTO. SILICON VALLEY IS. AND IN ADDITION -- IN ADDITION OF THOSE PIECES WE HAVE OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF FEDERAL STATE LEVEES. IT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED AS A STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IT'S OWNED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OPERATED TO MAINTAIN MOSTLY BY LOCAL AGENCIES. AND THE STANDARD FOR MINUTES IS REGULATED BY THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IN THE CENTRE LIKE FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD. ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS SYSTEM ARE THE WEIRS AND BY PASSES. WHICH ARE UP MOSTLY MAINTAINED BY THE STATE. AND AND THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM PASSED THROUGH THE SET THROUGH THE THROUGH THE BY PASS SYSTEM SHOWN IN GREEN. ON ON YOUR ON YOUR HAND OUT. IT'S NOT AS PREVALENT OF A BY PASS SYSTEM ON THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM THERE'S A SMALL BY PASSES OFF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER THAT CHURCHILL AND YOU SIDE BY PASS. AND THEN FURTHER ON TOWARDS TRACY YOU HAVE THE PESCADERO CUT WHICH ASK ACTS AS A BY PASS. SAID INFLOWS WEST THE WEST HILLS AS OPPOSED UP. INTO THE URBAN AREAS OF STOCKTON -- TOOLS OF THE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS OF THE FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM THAT I WANT. TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF BUT THERE'S ALSO IS MICHAEL TO THE NON STRUCTURAL PIECES TO THE SYSTEM WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MANAGE THE SYSTEM. THE PUBLIC ENTITIES. THEY OPERATE MAINTAIN THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM AND YOU. YOU'LL YOU'LL HEAR FROM PANELIST REPRESENTING THOSE ENTITIES TODAY OTHERS ALSO THE GAUGE NETWORK AND YOU AND IN THE END NOW ALSO STAYED BEHIND THE MANAGEMENT THIS THE SYSTEM AND IT'S IT'S ROBUST ENCOMPASSES THE ENTIRE. QUITE A BIT OF A WATERSHED -- AND THAT'S LARGELY HOW ARE FORECAST AND ARE STILL NOT FORECASTER. ARE A ARE CREATED USING THE GAVE SYSTEM. SO WE'RE GONNA JUMP THROUGH HAND OUT THREE AND THEN -- SHORTLY AND A HAND OUT FOR HERE -- WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN THIS GRAPHIC ON HAND OUT THREE IT'S JUST REVISED CONTACTS THAT AS WERE MANAGING THE FLOOD ISKS OUT HERE THERE HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED YEARS OF OUR BUS PLANNING EFFORTS -- THIS GRAPHIC HERE TO PICKS WITH DOTS ALL OF THE MAJOR FLOODS AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. AND THEN ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS YOU'RE SEEING OFF THE SIDE OR EITHER PROJECTS OR SOME SORT OF FEASIBILITY STUDY OR A PLAN THAT HAS BEEN CLEVERLY WORK BETWEEN THE STATE -- FEDERAL AGENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES -- A FEW FLOOD EVENTS IN THOSE DOTS THAT HE JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ARE VERY FOUNDATIONAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM. IS IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN NINETEEN OH NINE FLOOD EVENTS -- THAT'S WHAT MOST OF THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY WAS ORIGINALLY SIZED FOR THE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE FLOOD EVENT WAS VERY NOTABLE THAT WAS PART OF THE JUSTIFICATION FOR CREATION OF ORAL DAM. WHICH MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AS PART OF STATE WATER PROJECT BUT IS A CRITICAL FACILITY IN THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL FACILITY. AND PROVIDES FLOOD PROTECTION FOR THE FEATHER AND SEPARATE LOWER SACRAMENTO VALLEY'S. AND THEN -- THE LAST OF THE MAJOR FLOOD EVENTS WAS THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX FLOOD EVENT WHICH REYES REFERRED TO DURING HER PRESENTATION AND THE CONTEXT THAT THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF THE LEGISLATION. TO HAVE A SYSTEM MY PLAN THE SENATE BY FOR PROTECTION PLAN. AND JOHN'S GOING TO PULL UP THE SECOND SLIDE NOW WHICH IS -- A MAP JUST IN IS INDICATING AND THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF WHERE THE STATE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS HAS BOUGHT DOWN RISK THROUGH BOTH -- STRUCTURAL IN NONSTRUCTURAL MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS MADE WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. NOW PART OF THAT WAS DUE TO PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN THEY WERE ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE WAS NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THEIR PORTIONS OF THAT MONEY WAS SET ASIDE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WITH THE REMAINING PORTIONS THAT MONEY WAS TO BE DISTRIBUTED STATEWIDE -- BUT THIS GIVES YOU AN INDICATION THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT THOSE DOTS REPRESENT ALL REPRESENT SORT OF A BLEND OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE STAIR STEP GRAPHIC OFF TO THE RIGHT HERE -- WITH THAT THE APPROACH BY WHICH WE WERE GOING THROUGH AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE DETAIL OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THOSE PROJECTS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. CAN BE SEEN NOW IN HAND OUT FIVE IN IN THIS PARTICULAR GRAPHIC OFF TO THE LEFT YOU'RE LOOKING OUT THE LOWER THE A BY PASS OF THE A BY PASS IS ONE OF THAT SYSTEM A BY PASS IS FOR THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THERE IN THE BLUE IS YOUR BY ASSETS THIRTY FIVE MILES LONG THE SACRAMENTO RIVER STARTS OFF TO THE WEST OF THEIR CUTS ACROSS THE TOP OF THE A BY PASS. AND THEN PASSES ESSENTIALLY TO THE EAST OF THE A BYPASS -- AND TOGETHER THEY WORK AS A SYSTEM DURING FLOOD EVENTS ABOUT 80% OF THE FLOOD WATERS ACTUALLY MOVED THROUGH THE YELLOW BYPASS THEIR EFFECTIVELY PROTECTING. THE GREATER SACRAMENTO WEST SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN AREA -- BUT THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE BY PASSES WHEN IT'S NOT BEING USED FOR FLOOD PROTECTION IT IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION FOR YOLO SOLANO COUNTY. AS WELL AS AN AREA WHERE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VERY ROBUST -- AB IN A WATERFALL AND AQUATIC SPECIES AN IMPORTANT FOOD SOURCE SO THIS IS BECOME A FLAGSHIP FOR WILL BE CALL INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT OR MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS. IN THE MAP ALL THE LITTLE WHITE COLLAR BOXES YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND LOCAL AGENCIES BUT THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THE LOCAL MEANT LEVY MAINTAINING AGENCIES AND LAND OWNERS. HAVE COLLECTIVELY WORKED ON AN ARTICULATED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CENTER I FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN. NOW JUMPING DOWN INTO THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE DELTA THERE'S A CONCEPTUAL GRAPHIC HERE FOR PARADISE CUT EXPANSION -- VERY SIMILAR TO THE A BY PASS AGAIN THIS IS A STRUCTURE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE CONVEYANCE OF WATER THE WATER WILL NOT GO DOWN AS SEMI CAN RIVER AND CAN ENTER INTO THE OLD AND MIDDLE RIVERS -- THE SIZING OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE FOR THE PARADISE CUT WAS ACTUALLY CONDITIONED ON FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE CONDITIONS SO WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING WHAT IS EQUIVALENT TO A VERY LARGE DROP IN THE THE FLOODWATERS PASSING THROUGH STOCKTON MANTECA. AND A LINE THAT WATER TO MOVE THROUGH THE DELTA WELL ACHIEVING HABITAT OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL THE MOST COLORFUL GRAPHICS. ARE THE MOST COLORFUL GRAPHIC OF THE OF THE DAY IS IT SHOWS HOW WEGOT TO WHERE WE ARE THIS WINTER. THIS IS A APART PUT TOGETHER BY CW THREE YOU PICK THE THE CENTER FOR WESTERN WEATHER AND WATER EXTREMES. AND AND AND THE BEAT BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM TO HELP DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVER PROCESSES. AND AND FORECASTING AND TO BUILD AWARENESS BECAUSE THIS HELPS US MANAGE FLOOD WATERS AS WELL AS MANAGE -- MANAGE WATER SUPPLY. AND SO. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE SUCH A WET WINTER FORTY SEVEN OCCURS ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS MADE LANDFALL ON THOUGH -- CONNELL US HALF OF THOSE. MADE LANDFALL IN THE STATE IT ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE ABOUT A 126% OF OUR STATEWIDE AVERAGE THIS YEAR. AND JUST. THE IN GAME THE IMPORTANCE OF OF WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS IS THAT AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVER PROCESSES REDUCES THE UNCERTAINTY. IMPROVES OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE REAL TIME FLOOD RISK ENABLES LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO BETTER MEET THEIR MULTIPLE WATER MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. THE NEXT GRAPHIC WE HAVE UP AS ANOTHER STEP SORT OF WHERE WE'RE AT THE PRESENT SITUATION -- YOUR MATE BEGINNING IN MAY HERE AND SO THIS IS A THIS IS A FIGURE WITH DATA THAT COMES FROM OUR A CALIFORNIA DID EXCHANGE CENTER AS WELL WHICH IS FED BY THE THE RESERVOIR OPERATORS AS WELL AS THAT STATEWIDE MONITORING NETWORK OF GAUGES. THAT I TOUCHED ON EARLIER AND AS YOU CAN SEE YEAH THE BLUE BAR SHOW THE STATUS OF THE RESERVOIRS. THAT'S A PRETTY FULL RESERVOIRS AT THIS MOMENT. NEARING THE TOP CONSERVATION WHICH IS THAT RED LINE WHICH IS ANYTHING ABOVE THAT IS SPACE OF THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS REGULATES AND WANTS TO KEEP OPEN. IN CASE THERE'S A THERE'S AN INFLUX OF INFLOWS IN THAT RESERVOIR FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE RESERVOIR AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE THE DOWNSTREAM COMMUNITIES. HELLO BAR ON THE RIGHT. WITH THE KIND OF SNOW OUTLINES THAT'S THE FORECASTED -- SNOW MELT IT REMAINS TO BE THE BEST IS YET TO RUN OFF OUT OF THE OUT OF THE WATER SHOULD ABOVE THOSE RESERVOIRS. AND THAT'S THAT'S DATA THAT'S COMES FROM ARSENAL CENTER NETWORK AS WELL AS OUR MANUAL SNOW -- ARSENAL MEASUREMENTS. AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE THE THE WET WEATHER WE GOTFULL RESERVOIRS AND IT'S ALSO BEEN A COLD WINTER WHICH MEANS WE'VE GOT A WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A DEEP SNOW PACK. AND WE PEAKED IN AT FORTY FIVE INCHES OF STATEWIDE SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST AND ALREADY WE'VE LOST ABOUT TWENTY INCHES. OF THAT OF THAT FORTY FIVE INCHES JUST IN THE STOMACH THAT OCCURRED IN APRIL. QUESTION SO THE STATE. DOESN'T OPERATE OWNER OPERATOR YEAH CERTAINLY. TO ASK A QUESTION [inaudible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inaudible] WE'RE DONE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR THE ACTUAL PRESENTATIONS AND CERTAINLY BRIDGE TOPIC AT THIS TIME WILL BRING ABOUT THE NUMBERS I SEE THE MYSTICAL YES QUESTION. AND I WAS SORT OF MULTI TASKING SO SHAME ON ME. BUT DO YOU END UP HAVING A IS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEM REQUIRE GREATER COORDINATION AMONG SORT OF PARTNER AGENCIES. MY SENSE IS THE SACK ROSE MORE STATE BROWN. THAT THAT THE BIG RELEASES ARE ARE. MADE BY STATE AGENCIES IN COORDINATION ORVILLE FALL SOME. TO WEAR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A NEED FOR MORE. COORDINATION. OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES EACH WITH A PIECE TO CONSENT WATER INTO THE COMMON CHANNEL. IS THAT MORE RECORD NATION. ON THE SAN JOAQUIN. AMONG PART RATES USE AS OPPOSED TO WITHIN. THE STATE D. W. R.. AND HOW TO AND IS THAT WORK GENERALLY. PRETTY WELL YEAH I THINK YOU YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT THERE -- WE DO HAVE A SIMILAR FORECAST COURTED OPERATIONS GROUP ON THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM PASSED BETWEEN THE HAVE TO ORVILLE AND AND THE FED I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WATER FROM MORE OF BILL IS GOING TO PASS THE CONFUSED AMERICAN REVERSAL THAT FALL SOME WATER CAN. SEVEN BEHIND IT AND VICE VERSA. FOR EXAMPLE -- BUT HERE YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S THERE'S MORE RESERVOIRS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN -- THERE'S LESS. THE STATE DOESN'T MAINTAIN. ANY OF THE SYSTEM ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER THAT'S ALL MAINTAINED BY LOCAL LIVING MAINTAINING AGENCIES -- AND RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR THE FOR ADDED COORDINATION AT THAT POOR LEVEL LIKE YOU SAID AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- WE'VE THE THE STATE THROUGH ITS PROP TWENTY AND ON MY PROPERTY FOR FINDING US AS PUT SOME LOCAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS OUT THERE -- TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ENCOURAGE LOCALS -- THE LOCAL NOT LETTING MAINTAINING AGENCIES TO COME WHEN YOU COULD BE BETTER ALIGNED WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND THOSE COUNTY OFFICES OFFICES OF THE BRITISH SERVICE TO BE MORE AWARE OF WHAT EACH OTHER'S -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S WITH A LOT OF A LOT OF PLANNING AT THE LOCAL AND COUNTY LEVEL FOR EMERGENCIES FLOOD EMERGENCY SPECIFICALLY -- TRAINING EXERCISES AT THE COUNTY LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN -- BUILDING STOCKPILES OF FLOOD BY MATERIALS AT THE COUNTY AND LOCAL LEVEL -- DANIELLE. IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM ONE OF THE PANELLISTS LATER ON YOU CAN AND MAYBE SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT -- AND SO YEAH THAT THAT THAT IS A NEED FOR FOR GREATER COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT HAD A SURE OF THAT ALL TWENTY CHANNELS ONLY SO LARGE. AND YOU CANNOT HAVE ALL THE AGENCIES SENDING WATER OFF THEIR LITTLE PIECE. IT WAS ALL GUNNA CONVERSION A POINT IN THE CHANNEL WORD. OVERFLOWS. SO YOU SORT OF HAVE TO HAVE A TIME IN A QUEUE IN SEQUENCE SEEN. IN PEOPLE AND FOR THOSE PIECES OUT. AND I'M GENERALLY FIRMER WAS OUT ON THE ON THE SACRAMENTAL -- AND I I I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO WATER FOR MORE REAL TO PASS THE CONFLUENCE OF THE AMERICAN RIVER OR THE WHERE WHEN IT'S OPEN AND AND CONSEQUENTLY. WHEN WHEN RELEASE COULD BE MADE FROM FULSOME AND TRAVEL -- DOWN PAST MY CITY AND IT JUST. THE THE TIMING OF ALL THESE PIECES I JUST SORT OF ASSUMED AT THE STATE LEVEL ON THE NORTH ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. IT WAS GOT THAT HANDLED. AND YOU MANAGE MORE THAT IN HOUSE. AS OPPOSED TO NEEDED IT JUST CORD AND EVERYONE WITH THEIR PIECE. I'D I'D SAY IT'S SETTLED -- I WOULDN'T CALL IT IN HOUSE I WOULDN'T WE'RE NOT WE'RE WE'RE NOT TRAFFIC COPS OUT THERE THAT ARE YOU KNOW. IT'S MORE OF A ROUND ABOUT. THAT IS THAT A FOUR WAY STOP. IF THERE IS MAYBE THE WAY I'D. WELL I DEFINITELY SEE THAT ON THE SAN JOAQUIN AYE AYE ME MY SENSE IS THERE'S MORE STATE. CONTROL ON THE SACRAMENTAL THE NORTHERN END MAYBE I'M. YES TO SIMPLISTIC WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADD IT'S IN CONTEXT AND LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS THE THE SAN JOAQUIN I THINK BIãU IS MEMBERS ARE AWARE THIS THE MOUNTAINS THERE ARE HIGHER HITS THE SNOW BASIN. THE RESERVOIRS IN THE SACRAMENTO BASE ARE ACTUALLY A BIT YOUNGER -- THEY WERE NEWER FACILITIES AND WE HAVE LEARNED FROM SOME OF THE LESSONS ON HOW TO COORDINATE EARLY ON IN THE FIFTIES THE CHALLENGES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. SO WHEN THE FLOOD CONTROL POLLS WERE ESTABLISHED FOR WELL NEW BULLARD SPARSE ON THE FEATHER AND THE UNIVERSE THERE WAS A JOINT OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATION THAT WAS PUT INTO THAT FLOOD OPERATION THERE. SO THERE THE REASON THAT YOU HAVE. EARLIER COORDINATION ON THE SACRAMENTO BASIN IT WAS ACTUALLY PLACED INTO THE ACTUAL RULES OF HOW THEY WOULD WORK TOGETHER. I HAD A COUPLE. A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- AND I WOULD DRAW BOTH THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION AND THE PANELS ATTENTION. TO THIS IS DOCTOR THE DOCUMENT TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE RESIDENTIAL FUND RISK IF WE GO TO PAGE. SEVEN WE HAVE RESERVOIR CONDITIONS AND SNOW ABOUT TWENTY NINETY A AND IT WOULD JUST A QUICK. CLICK GLIMPSE OF THIS DOCUMENT -- WHAT'S CONCERNING. IS CERTAIN RIVERS. WELL DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SAN JOAQUIN FOR EXAMPLE. HAVE SNOW MELT. AND I SERVICES AND THOUSAND ACRE FEET RISE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- A 10% CHANCE OF THE WORK WORST CASE SCENARIO WHAT WAS AT ONE POINT SIX MILLION. ACRE FEET OF WATER IN THE SNOW MELT. THAT'S A 10% CHANCE AND THE RESERVOIR CAPACITY IS DOWN AT WHAT SEE. 65% CAP ON IS THAT LESS THAN A HALF A MILLION ACRE FEET. I THINK IT IS. YEAH. SO. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND THEN YOU TAKE YOUR EYES AND HEAD UP TO THE TOP LEFT CORNER HERE WITH THE SACRAMENTO RIVER BASIN. THEY'RE SITTING ON FOUR AND A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET OF STORAGE. AND THEIR CAP IS AT 94% OF THAT -- WHATEVER THAT WORKS OUT TO A LITTLE OVER FOUR MILLION ACRE FEET. OF STORAGE AND AND IF YOU LOOK TO THIS THE SNOW PACK THERE IS OBVIOUSLY SO MY POINT BEING. IN SOME RIVERS WE'VE GOT LOTS OF STORAGE. AND SMALLER SNOW PACKS AND THEN DOWN HERE WE'VE GOT BIG SNOW PACKS AND NOT ENOUGH STORAGE IT LOOKS LIKE -- WHICH TELLS ME THAT WE'RE RELEASING A LOT OF WATER IF WE HIT THAT 10% SITUATION AND OR WERE FLOODING RIGHT. YEAH IT IS THAT AN ACCURATE STATEMENT. AND SO TO THE LAY PERSON OR THE COMMONSENSE PERSON. YOU WOULD THINK WE NEED TO BUILD SOME MORE STORAGE ON THIS PARTICULAR RIVERS. IN ORDER. TO ACHIEVE. YOUR BETTER FLOOD CONTROL SITUATION. AT LEAST HAVE SOME. HELLO FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT OR SAYS SOMETHING THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME ADDITION -- WHAT WOULD YOU ALL SUGGEST -- I IT'S ACTUALLY THE PORTFOLIO JUST LIKE SUGGESTED OUT THERE IT'S A COMBINATION OF ACTIONS -- KING TO THE HAND OUT ONE WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL SEE SOME OF THOSE -- THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH -- OVER TIME AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT YELLOW PORTION NOW. CALL THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BASIN IS OUT THERE THAT FLOOD CONTROL POOL IS. A THREE OPERATION REDEFINED THE YELLOW VERSES THE BLUE SO THAT YOU HAVE MORE SPACE IN THE YELLOW TO PUT. THE SNOW INTO WHICH IS I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S ONE OPTION -- RACHEL TALKED EARLIER IN HER PORTFOLIO DISCUSSING THAT AS THE STATE ACTIONS OUT THERE THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SEEK EASEMENTS -- DOWNSTREAM AND IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE THE THE THE ACTUAL CONSEQUENCES OF FLOODING OUR LAST AND THOSE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF THINGS WE COULD GO THREE NEW -- THE THIRD THING THAT I POINT OUT IS IN SOME SMALL INSTANCES THROUGH PROPOSITION ONE THE STATE IS INVESTING TO TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN STORAGE PROJECTS ONE ON EXACTLY THAT POINT. IT WAS AS A MEMBER WHO IS HERE WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD WAS STORAGE FUNDING. WITH THE CONCEPT THAT THAT STORAGE FRONT WOULD ACHIEVE IN THIS EXACT REASONS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT -- INVESTMENT INTERPRETS FIGHT RESERVOIR WHICH I BELIEVE IS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN. YOUR CORRECT YES IN THE END YOU KNOW HOW MANY ACRE FEET -- THAT POTENTIAL PROJECT WOULD HAVE -- STORED. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER ON THAT HOWEVER I CAN'T CONFIRM THAT THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT -- DOES HAVE WHAT WE CALL INCIDENTAL FLOOD RISK BENEFITS IN THE STATUS COST SHARING TO ADDRESS THAT VERY ISSUE -- IT JUST STRIKES ME AGAIN THAT YOU KNOW IN SOME AREAS WE'VE GOT WAY WHAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE STORAGE OTHERS WE DON'T AND I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD TO WHERE I KNOW THE WATER COMMISSION SCORED SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WE THAT WE FUNDED. THROUGH THE WATER BOND -- AT LEVELS THAT YOU MAY NOT SEE THEM -- BUILT AND THIS. IS CONCERNING AND IT DOESN'T SEE LIKE DOES HE LIKE REPORT WE'RE MAKING AVAILABLE ALL THE TOOLS. FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND I'M KIND OF CURIOUS. WHY THAT IS SIR IF THE AND AND WHY IS THAT NOT IN THE STATE MANAGEMENT -- PORTFOLIO WE WILL GET BACK TO THE PATERNAL FIRST CALIFORNIA THE ESTABLISH OF THE S. P. FC. WHY DID THAT NOT MOVE UPSTREAM -- UP. BUT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND I THINK THE SECOND PANEL PROBABLY WOULD WANNA PROBABLY ADDRESS THAT AS WELL -- THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL THE ONLY RESERVOIR THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THAT SYSTEM IS OR BILL BECAUSE THE STATE ACTUALLY OWNS OR BILL WE'RE ALL OF THE RESERVOIRS WE HAVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN OR EITHER FEDERAL OR LOCAL ENTITIES. THIS BILL IS YOUR QUESTION. YOU'RE YOU'RE ON TRACK TO KEEP GOING. THE JURORS SO FIRST -- ONE I KNOW MR CORY ASKED LOOK ABOUT THE DATA. HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES -- MAKE THIS PSYCHOLOGY DATA AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL OF FOLKS IN A WAY THAT -- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE -- RIGHT ABOUT THAT SO BUT BASIC QUESTION A WE'D LIKE TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THAT. SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IN PLACE. YEAH WE WE WE THAT'S A THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART IS TO MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA THAT WORD THAT WORK WE'RE COLLECTING AND WE'RE ANALYZING IS BEING DESCENDED IN A WAY THAT'S UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE THAT THOSE THAT NEED IT. AND SO -- WHEN WE MAKE AVAILABLE DATA REAL TIME THAT THE DATA YOU FIND ON CALIFORNIA DATA EXCHANGE CENTER WHICH WE USE PRETTY EXCLUSIVELY IS NOT YOU SEE THIS THIS THE RAW DATA COMING IN FROM THE FROM THE GAUGES -- AND THAT SO THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET -- ANYONE CAN GO TO THAT GO TO THAT WEBSITE -- WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA RIVER FORECAST CENTER. THEY ISSUE YOU KNOW YOU MAY BE AND THE YOU KNOW THEY THEY ISSUE THERE FOR THE RIVER FORECAST ON THEIR OWN. ON THEIR OWN PAGE BUT WE WE CONTRIBUTE TO THAT ANALYSIS. AND AND AND THAT'S AVAILABLE PUBLICLY ON THE INTERNET. AND AND WE ALSO DO HIGH WATER NOTIFICATION CALLS WILL ACTUALLY CALL LADY LOOK LOCALLY BLOODY MAINTAINERS UP OR INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS. UP AND LET THEM KNOW WHEN OF STAGE AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION OF THEIR OF THEIR INTEREST IS GONNA REACH MONITOR A FLUTTER DANGER STAGE -- AND THERE'S ALSO THE YOU KNOW THROUGH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE THEIR THEIR ALERT WARNING SYSTEM YOU KNOW THE BUZZERS IF YOU GET ON YOUR CELL PHONE ONCE IN AWHILE. YOU'LL THAT THE ISSUE WARNINGS -- THAT WAY TOO AND SO THERE'S THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO ONE THAT THEY CAN PULL DATA. OFF THE WEBSITES BUT WE'RE ALSO GETTING INTO A DAY AND AGE WERE MORE DATE IS CAN BE CAN BE PUSHED IF PEOPLE WANT TO GO IN AND REGISTER -- FOR NOTIFICATIONS CAN BE PUSHED TO THEM -- AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA IS UNDERSTOOD. WE ROUTINELY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WILL MEET WITH PARTNERS ON YOU KNOW. HOW TO HOW TO UNDERSTAND AND DIGEST WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AND ONE OF THE REQUESTED WE DO HAVE FROM COUNTY? OFFICES OF THE MERGER SERVICES WHEN WHEN THERE'S A HIGH WATER THEN AS WITH THE LAST FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SOMEONE FROM THE FLIGHT CENTER TO COME DOWN. AND BE IN THEIR COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE AWARE AND THEIR DIGESTING UNDERSTANDING ALL THIS INFORMATION -- YOU KNOW IN AN ENTRY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND ARE NOT MISINTERPRETING ARE MISSING SOMETHING. JUST ON A THE GENERAL -- I GUESS A PERSPECTIVE. WHO ARE THE PARTNERS JUST FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND? AND TO AND HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHO WHO THEY ARE WAR WE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY YOU. PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION TO THE PARTNERS. YES SO THE THE PARTNER'S ONE IS OUR OUR OUR COOPERATORS THAT WORK WITH US ON ON SNOW MEASUREMENTS IN A AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN GAUGING NETWORK SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ON THE RESERVOIR OPERATORS THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CITY GAUGES THAT WE ALL SHARE INFORMATION -- YET THE POWER COMPANIES P. JEANNIE SO CALLOUS AND THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF DATA YOU KNOW THEY GOT A LOT OF CENTERS UP IN THE WATERSHED -- THE RESERVOIR OPERATORS YOU KNOW THE MAJOR ONES ON THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM WERE GETTING DATA REAL TIME -- AND THEN PUT THE BOOK WILL THE RESERVOIR OPERATORS YOU GOT. TO THAT THE COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGERS AND THE LOCAL LIVING MAINTAINING AGENCIES -- THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND THE OF THE WONDER TO PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE PATROLLING LEVEES DURING HIGH WATER DANCE -- MAKING THAT INITIAL ATTACK ON AN INCIDENT IT'S A RELIGION SIDE OR A BOILER SOME KIND OF SEEPAGE -- YEAH THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WERE TRYING TO AND TRYING TO INFORM. BUT MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE AROUND THE THE SMALLER RIVERS. AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE -- THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FROM YOUR? PERSPECTIVE IN WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S CONSTANT RISK MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT AND KEEPING -- THOSE PARTNERS - IN THE LOOP. I'LL TAKE A CRACK AT THAT ONE JUST FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OF FLIGHT OPERATIONS AND SO THE BUT THE DEPARTMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA RIVER FORECAST CENTERS FUNDS WE DON'T. DO RIVER FORECAST FOR EVERY EVERY STREAMING THE STATE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S THE MAIN. MAIN RIVERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT THOSE SMALLER SMALLER STREAMS WHICH CAN BE JUST AS AND NO IMPACTFUL AND ARMING TO TO SMALL COMMUNITIES -- WEEK THROUGH OUR GRANTS FOR THE THINGS THAT WE'VE WE FIND IT IS THE THE UPGRADE OF THEIR ALERT WARNING SYSTEMS. AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL COUNTIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT. TO TO SO THAT THEY HAVE BETTER QUALITY DATA ON YOU KNOW HOW WHAT WHAT THE STAGES IN THEIR RIVER OF CONCERN OR THEIR TO THEIR CREEK OF CONCERN. AND AND HAVE THAT DATA TO LIMITED RIGHT INTO THEIR COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT OR COUNTY AND THE BIRDS HE OFFICE OF THE BURDEN COUNTY -- EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. AND I'LL JUST ADD A NOTE IS THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE THERE'S WITHIN SACRAMENTO TO OFFICES THEY GET INVOLVED IN EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS IT'S THE RIVER FORECASTS ARE THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA RIVER FORECAST CENTER WHICH JOHN MENTIONED WHICH HANDLES THE LARGER RIVERS. AND THEN THERE IS THE SACRAMENTO -- WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE -- THERE OFFICES SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PRODUCTS FROM THE NATIONAL -- RIVER FORECAST CENTER PUSH DOWN TO THE WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE WHO THEN IS THE ENTITY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ON LIKE YOUR TELEVISION OR THE RADIO SENDING OUT THE ALERTS FOR THE SMALL CREEKS AND WATERSHED SO SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE. AT THIS TIME OF YEAR -- DICTATE THE BOTTOM OF THE THE TELEVISION A NOTIFICATION SOMETHING HAPPENED IT'S A FORECAST THAT COMES FROM THE LARGER GROUP TO THE SMALLER THAN THE HYDROLOGIST WHO ARE MY WITH THOSE WATERSHEDS THE FEDERAL LEVEL WORK TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ADD TO JOHN'S ANSWER IS THE WEATHER SERVICE HAD WITH THE CALL SERVICE COORDINATION HYDROLOGISTS WHICH ARE SPECIALISTS TO GO THROUGH. AND ENGAGE THE LIST OF COMMUNITY SAID HE WENT OUT THERE AND WHEN WE'RE COMING UP WITH PROTOCOLS ON WHAT IS THE LEVEL -- TO ALERT PEOPLE AT ITS THE LOCALS WHO THEN COME UP TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF WHAT THAT THRESHOLD IS SO IT'S NOT A TOP DOWN PROCESS BUT RATHER A BOTTOM UP. I'VE GOT TO ASK JUST A FEW QUESTIONS ARE PUT INTO ONE FOR LA -- REPRESENTATIVE -- TALKING ABOUT PERHAPS -- THIS HAS BEEN ALREADY LOOKED AT INVESTMENTS IN TRADITION -- FLOOD PROTECTION INFRASTRUCTURE VERSES. FLOODPLAIN RESTORATION AND THEN THE OTHER IS -- OUR INFORMATION TELLS HOUSES WE'VE SPENT ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. ON THIS MATTER AND DO WE HAVE A BALLPARK FIGURE OF REALLY WHAT THE STATE WIPED A ASSESSMENT MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF NEED. THE TICKET FOR SHOT AT THAT AND THEN KICK IT TO THE DEPARTMENT -- YES THERE HAS BEEN AND A VERY. LARGE INCREASE AND FOCUS ON THE MULTI BENEFIT APPROACH -- IN IN FACT IN PROPOSITION ONE AND I THINK IN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT AS WELL THOUGH HE BONDS WERE WRITTEN WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT THOSE FUNDS GO FOR MULTI BENEFIT -- FLOOD MANAGEMENT PROJECTS -- THERE AND THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY IN ESTIMATES ON NEED. ALWAYS IN THE MULTIPLE TENS OF BILLIONS -- OF DOLLARS ACROSS THE STATE I THINK IT WAS WAS IT TWENTY BILLION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN -- JUST FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- SOME OF THE OTHER ESTIMATES I'VE SEEN I'VE BEEN KIND OF IN THE FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR RANGE ACROSS THE STATE -- FOR FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD BE ACROSS MULTIPLE DECADES AND I WAS SO THAT'S NOT A SINGLE YEAR ESTIMATE BUT IN TERMS OF NEEDS SO SO CLEARLY AND NOT A LOT OF NEED OUT THERE I WOULD JUST AGAIN HIGHLIGHT -- THAT TYPICALLY THE FUNDING COMES FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES LOCAL FEDERAL AND STATE AND THE STATE HAS NOT BEEN THE LARGEST SOURCE IN IN THOSE FUNDS BUT WIND THE STATE HAS PUT MANY IT HAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND AND STATE PLAN IF I'M CONTROL BECAUSE OF THAT SPECIAL. LIABILITY THAT WE HAVE BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY THESE BONDFUNDS HAVE ALSO BEEN USED AND BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS AND OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. AND BE A SOURCE OF THE THE DOLLAR ESTIMATES THAT RACHEL HAD INDICATED OUT THERE THE TWENTY ONE BILLION HAT WE HAVE FOR THE SOME BY THE PROTECTION PLAN. IS LOOKING AT STATE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS PROJECTS THAT LOCAL ENTITIES TO PROVIDE A MORE INCLUDED WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO THAT THE PLOT PLAN ADVOCATES. FOR THE STATEWIDE ESTIMATE OF FIFTY BILLION FIFTY BILLION IS THAT ACTUAL DISCRETE LISTA PROJECTS WHERE THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES AND THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. INTERVIEWED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT FLOOD MANAGEMENT ENTITIES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN FROM THEN HAVE AN ACTUAL LIST OF DEFINED PROJECTS SO THE FIFTY IS. PROJECTS THAT ARE CONCEPTUALIZED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD ON AND WE'RE WE GET UP TO THE HUNDRED BILLION THAT'S A GAS THAT THESE WOULD BE THE NEXT LEVEL OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD COME. TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE FLOOD RISK. HELLO TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE CHAIRMAN'S QUESTION -- IF WE HAVE THE NUMBER PICKED AT FIFTY AND WE'VE DONE. SEVERAL WATER BONDS -- IN RECENT MEMORY. HOW MUCH OF HOW HOW MUCH OF WE DONE AND WHAT IN WATER BONDS HERE IN TOTAL AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE FIFTY BILLION AND AND OF THE NUMBER THAT WE'VE DONE AND WATER BONDS? HOW MUCH OF IT ACTUALLY GOES TO FIXING ANY OF THAT FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR? ISSUE SO ON PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT THERE'S A FIGURE THAT SHOWS -- OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES THE PROPORTION OF THE BONDS THAT HAVE PASSED THAT IT HAD FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES -- SO FIVE POINT SIX BILLION SO WITH. SO WHAT'S THAT TOTAL. SO FIVE POINT SIX BILLION HAS BEEN DEDICATED FROM WATER BONDS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY. OF A FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM. CORRECT BUT AGAIN I THINK AS NOTED THAT FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE WAS PROJECTS TO ANTICIPATED NOT THAT THE STATE WOULD WOULD PLAY THAT. BE THE SOLE FINDER IT IS STORE KLAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF SOME OF% THE BIG PROJECTS STATE FAIR STATEMENT -- OF THE BIG PROJECTS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS. CHOSEN TO INVEST IN WHICH I THINK IT IS. LAW EMITTED. A WOMAN'S LAST TIME THEY MADE ONE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS READ VERY RECENTLY YEAH IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS -- CURRENTLY THERE'S A TWO BILLION DOLLAR -- SPECIAL INITIATIVE FOR THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO INVEST IN THEIR COST SHARING THE PROJECTS AND INVESTED. ARE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE FLOOD PLAN AND UP PART OF THE REASON THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO GET THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE STILL HAVE TO GET -- WAS THEY LOOKED AT THE ACTUAL LIST OF PROJECTS ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER ACTIONS IN THE CONFERENCE PORTFOLIO. THAT -- THE LOCALS IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH OUR PLANNING EFFORTS TO THE BUILDING AND THEN A FIVE IT WE HAVE THE NUMBER THE TOTAL WATER BOND NUMBER FRIENDLY DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE FIVE BILLION THAT'S GONE TOWARDS FLOOD MANAGEMENT BUT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT WE'VE. AUTHORIZED. I THINK IT'S AROUND THIRTY BILLION THIRTY ONE MAYBE SO OUT OF THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS WE'VE WE'VE ALL THE ALLOCATED -- FIVE TWO THIS SUBJECT OF FUND MANAGEMENT SINCE YOU DO HAVE WATER PARKS CRACKS THAT THIRTY ONE BILLION IT WATER AND RESOURCES SO THERE'S MANY FOR PARKS AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES IN IN THOSE BONDS BUT OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES BOND SINCE TWO THOUSAND I THINK IT'S THIRTY ONE BILLION. LET ME DRAW YOUR ATTENTION BACK. TO MY FAVORITE CHART HERE -- OF ALL THOSE RIVERS IF WE GOT TO THE 10% PROBABILITY OF THE SNOW MELT. WHERE WHERE'S THE GREATEST FLOOD RISK? AB. IN THE HERE AND NOW -- USUALLY WERE WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE URBAN POPULATIONS SO LOOKING UP THERE WE WOULD BE USUALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING UP IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION. BUT THE WHAT WE DON'T ALWAYS FACTOR INTO THAT IS THE ACTUAL -- REAL TIME FIELD CONDITIONS OUT THERE MEANING THE CONDITIONS OF THE LEVEES THE ABILITY TO CONVEY THE FLOWS THROUGH. SO ANY GIVEN TIME YOU CRITICS. YOU HAVE THEIR RULE NUMBER ONE SHIP TO EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED THE FLOOD WILL NOT HAPPEN FOR YOU THINK IT WILL IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEWHERE ELSE. I LET ME ASK THAT AGAIN -- WHERE WITH THE MOST FLOODING OCCUR NOT TAKE IN THE CONSIDERATION YOU KNOW YOUR PRIORITY LIST OF ALL WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT AFTER THE URBAN FOLKS FIRST WHICH? SOUND OFF A LOT LIKE THE OPERATE KIND LIKE LEGISLATURE FROM. HERE. URBAN COMMUNITIES FIRST -- THAT ASIDE. WHO'S LEAST WHICH RIVERS LEAST PREPARED TO HANDLE THE SIZE OF THE STONE OUT. AT 10%. YEAH I'D I'D I THINK IT IT'S STILL KIND OF DEPENDS I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT. CAN I ASK A RELATED QUESTION. WHICH COOLEY. I MEAN AREN'T. DON'T THESE SORTS OF ISSUES YOU KNOW WE'RE NOW IN MAY IF WE HAD A VERY SUSTAIN HOT PERIOD. ISN'T THAT WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT. IT'S YOU KNOW IN JANUARY IT'S ALWAYS YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT WARM RAIN STORM THAT IS ACTUALLY MELTING THE SNOW MELT AS A FALLS OUT OF THE SKIES. NOW REGIS WE'RE SORT OF STUCK WITH WE JUST HAVE A VERY SUSTAIN PERIOD OF HIGH HEAT. THE STAR CENTER WATER. I ACTUALLY DO KEEP THE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY -- HYDRAULIC HYDROLOGY ON MY PHONE SO I WATCHED. THE THE RIVER FLOW GOING UP AND DOWN -- ON A DAILY BASIS SO NOW I THINK WE'RE GETTING IN THE WARM TIME HERE WE IF WE GET INTENSE HEAT. IT'S JUST ARE SENATE WATER DOWNSTREAM AND THEN. YOU CAN'T HAVE THE WATER OVERTOPPING A SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE RELEASES. NO YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT IN ALL BUT CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO HAND OUT EIGHT AND THE PACKAGE THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE IN OF THE THE DETAIL WEEKS BUT THIS IS EXACTLY. THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE RUN THROUGH IN THE COMING UP THE OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS THAT ARE THE BASIS FOR THE RESERVOIR FOR NATIONS AND A HAND OUT EIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM HALF. YOU'LL SEE DOWN THERE IN -- THE IT'S REALLY THE BOTTOM HALF SORT OF THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER IT SAYS F. IN F. FORECAST SELECTION HAVE TYPICAL WEATHER PATTERNS WET AVERAGE WITH THOSE ARE CHOOSE OUR BOXES. AND YOU CAN GO THROUGH IF YOU'RE REALLY RISK ADVERSE AND PUT IN A VERY WET. BUT WARM SCENARIO. AND THAT WILL THEN ALLOW THE TOOL TO GO THROUGH ND SHOW YOU HEY HERE'S MORE WATER THAT COULD POTENTIALLY COMING AS AN ACTUAL SNOW MELT QUICKER. AND THEN LOOK AT THE DASHBOARD AT THE TOP AND SEE HOW THAT SYSTEM IS RESPONDING TO THAT PARTICULAR SCENARIO SO EACH RESERVOIR OPERATOR HAS WITHIN THEIR TOOL KIT. THE ABILITY TO ASK THAT INDIVIDUAL QUESTION AND THEN THROUGH THE COORDINATION CALLS THEY SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES. AND REALLY WHAT THE STATE'S ROLE IS TO HELP FACILITATE OKAY WHO CAN HOLD BACK. SO THAT THIS AREA WHERE WE SEE IT THIS PRESENT CONDITION A GREATER RISK. THEY CAN MOVE FIRST AND FORWARD IN TIME AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE DIDN'T HIGHLIGHT WE ARE COUNTING FOR THAT ROUTING OR THAT TIME TRAVEL OF THE WATER AS IT MOVES THERE SO IF YOU'RE FURTHER AWAY FROM A POINT OF CONCERN. THAT'S INCLUDED WITHIN THE TOOL. TO AND YOU HAVE A MODEL THAT COORDINATES. THE DOWNSTREAM RIVER CHANNEL WITH ALL THE OTHER FLOWS. BE BECAUSE IT'S THE CUMULATIVE AFFECT. IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW THE MERCED RIVER THE TO ALL OF ME. THE SAN JOAQUIN IT'S THE WATER THIS POINT TO ALL THOSE CHANNELS. THAT EVENTUALLY START DROPPING INTO THE INTO THE VALLEY FLOOR AND HAVE TO WORK THEIR WAY NORTH. INTO DELTA. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND ON THE THE UPPER PANEL OF THAT SAME HAND OUT EIGHT THOSE GREEN DOTS WILL TURN OTHER COLORS WHEN WE START ACTUALLY SEEING WHAT WE CALL THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS IS THE TECHNICAL TERM BUT IT'S THE CAPACITY OF THE CHANNELS. AT THOSE LOCATIONS WILL CHANGED OTHER COLORS. IN A SIMILAR COLOR NAMAN GLACIER TO WITH THE WEATHER SERVICE USES FOR THEIR TO ON THE WEB SO WE WE KIND OF KEPT WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONDITIONAL LIES. TO GREEN YELLOW RED AND ALL OF OUR TOOLS AND DASHBOARDS. ADVANCING TO SEE THIS WITH THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE FROM THEIR MAIN RESERVOIRS ON EACH OF THESE. RIVERS SLASH TRIBUTARIES TO WHEN THEY START ACTUALLY HITTING THE SAN JOAQUIN. JUST STANDARD WATER FLOW TIMES. DO YOU GUYS HAVE MODELING WHERE YOU COULD -- SHOW US WHAT. THAT 10% PROBABILITY OF THE LOOKS LIKE. AS FAR AS FIGHTING AGAINST. YEAH WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN THAT WE DO AS PART JUST A PART OF OUR OPERATION IS IS WORKING WITH THE RESTAURANT WRITERS. TO AND WE WE RUN SOME WORST CASE SCENARIOS OURSELVES AS A DEPARTMENT. TO TO KNOW WHERE -- NETWORK WHERE WE MIGHT BE AT RISK OF SOME OF THOSE. CHANNELS OF EXCEEDING OUR OBJECTIVES I JUST SAT THERE BRIEFINGS SERVE RISCO -- ON THE MERCED WITH A THAT BIOLOGIST DID SOME COMPUTER MODELING OF DIFFERENT CFS. NUMBERS AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE -- TO THE RIVER IN THE FLOOD PLAINS ROUNDED SOME SO FOR THE SHOULD YOU HAVE THE SAME CAPABILITY RIGHT. YEAH. THE QUESTION I'M STILL STRUGGLING WITH IS. AFTER SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO CENTRALIZE AS A LAYPERSON HOW APPEAR THE SACRAMENTO WHERE YOU'VE GOT FOUR AND A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET OF STORAGE. AND WORST CASE SNOW MEL IS ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION ACRE FEET. THAT THE RISK. IS IT FAR LESS THAN DOWN HERE ON THE SAN JOAQUIN WHERE THE TOTAL STORAGE -- IS MAYBE A HALF A MILLION ACRE FEET. AND THE WORST CASE SNOWMELT IS THREE TIMES THAT. SO I HAVE A HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT RESERVOIR. HAS THE SECOND YOU KNOW IS IT AT GREATER RISK IN THAT REGION ISN'T AT GREATER RISK FOR FLOODING A WORST CASE SCENARIO THAN THE SACRAMENTO. AND UNDERSTAND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN -- I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS I GET THAT BUT IT SEEMS VERY OBVIOUS RIGHT UP FRONT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE GREATEST RISK AND IT AM I MISS INTERPRETING THE FACTS HERE. WELL. WHAT I? I THINK IT'S A IT'S THE TERM THE TERM REST WHAT RISK IS IS A LIKELIHOOD OF FLOODING. TIMES THE CONSEQUENCE OF FLOODING. SO ON THE ON THE LIKE YOU MENTIONED ON THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF FLOODING THERE BASED ON THE SENATE IS VERY SMALL. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OUR POPULATIONS ARE SO THE CONSEQUENCES ARE ENORMOUSLY HIGH. ON THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM AND MAYBE THE OTHER PARTS ON THIS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEM THAT WE'RE YOU'RE DRAWING OUR ATTENTION. TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF FLOODING IS HIGHER. BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FAT FLOODING WOULD BE LOWER AND SO THAT'S WHY I STOPPED TAKING A TOUGH ANSWER WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WITH WHEN YOU USE THE TERM RISK NO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE NOW WE CAN. WE CAN BY FOR KATE RESCUED TWO CATEGORIES NOT A LIKELIHOOD SIDE. THEN WE COULD SAY WITH SOME CERTAINTY THAT SAM OUR KIDS IN THE WORST. POSITION. THERE'S DEFINITELY A CONCERN THERE -- I WANT TO THE LIMIT LIVING DRILL DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER FOR YOU -- IN ORDER TO MITIGATE FOR THAT POTENTIAL FLOODING WITH AFTER. RELEASED A WHOLE LOT OF WATER THROUGH THAT RESERVOIR RIGHT SO WERE WE WARMING UP COMPLEMENT WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT WATER SUPPLYAND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES FOR WATER SUPPLY AND SECURITY AS WE LOOK AT EXTENDED DROUGHTS AND WHICH IS ONE OF THE TOPICS -- REBECCA COR PORTION OF THE TOPIC HERE TODAY. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY RIVER IN THE SENSE THAT THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF WATER WOULD BE -- NOT STORING FOR THE FUTURE IN THE CASE OF A YOU KNOW HOT FEW HOT WEEKS OR HOT MONTH SET FAIR TO SAY. YES -- BUT I WANTED TO GO AND DO A LITTLE COMPARISON HERE BETWEEN -- SHASTA WHICH IS THE LARGEST OF OUR RESERVOIRS AND BACK -- TO MILLER TENANTS AND CAN RIVER THERE WHICH I THINK IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING -- THIS THE ORIGINAL SIZE IS DESIGNED BY THOSE TO RESERVOIRS YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S THE FOUR POINT FIVE IT SHASTA THOUSAND ACRE FEET. OR FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET SORRY AND THEN YOU HAVE A BASICALLY EFFECTIVELY A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET AS THE ACT OF STORAGE BOWL WITH NORTON MIKE. AND AT THE PARTY ORIGINAL DESIGN FOR THOSE TWO WATER SHEDS WE WERE ALWAYS. KNOWING THAT WE WOULD BE REFILLING A MILLER TEN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AS THE SNOW MELT BETWEEN APRIL AND JULY WOULD SLOWLY UP HER OUT THERE. SO THERE HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A METERING OF THAT SNOW PACK TO FILL THAT -- IN I THINK THE THE QUESTION AT HAND IS WINNER THE RULES GONNA CHANGE AND WHEN WILL WE SEE FASTER SNOW MELT INTO THAT AREA ANY TO LOOK INTO THAT -- THE GOOD NEWS IS IT DOES TAKE AWHILE FOR THAT TO OCCUR -- MEANING LIKE DECADES WHEN WE GET INTO THAT DEGREE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHEN WE WENT AND DID THE CENTER FIVE FOOT PROTECTION PLAN WE DID DO CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENTS I TALKED ABOUT. HOW PARADISE CUT WE SIZED SO WE LOOK DOWNSTREAM WITHOUT WATER WAS GOING ACTUALLY DESIGNED THE CHANNEL TO BE BROAD ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THAT WATER AS IT MOVES THROUGH AN IMPROVED SEVENTEEN RIVER SYSTEM -- BUT WE HAD OTHER AREAS WHERE WE HAD TRANSITORY STORAGE AREAS WHERE WATER CAN GET INTO THESE MULTI BENEFIT REFUGES ABOVE THAT AREA AS WELL AND WE DID -- PLAY AROUND WITH SOME RESERVOIR RE OPERATIONS WHICH WOULD BE LIKE REDEFINING THAT YELLOW SPACE IN BLUE SPACE WITHIN MILLER TEN SO THAT WE HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THERE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT IN A PLANNING CONSTRUCT AS THIS IS TALKING ABOUT PLANNING FOR AN AREA THE SIZE OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. SO WE HAD TO MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS AND THEN THE WAY THAT WE WOULD THEN MOVE IT IS. TEAR OFF OF THOSE PLANS TO GET TO MORE REAL FEASIBILITY STUDIES ABOUT IS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY WOULD WORK OR NOT. KNOWING THAT SURVIVED THE PROTECTION PLAN BY LAWS TO BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS SO AS WE DO OTHER ACTIONS AND HAVE OTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS. THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEN BECOMES THE NEW BASELINE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM CONTEXT PLANNING THIS BIGELOW. AS A CANDIDATE JUST TO LISTEN AND BE ON THE BALCONY AND AND JUST TRY TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE. BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW -- FOR MISTER COOLEY THERE IS A A GREAT DEAL COORDINATION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. AND ALONG THE THE WAY MOST OF THESE RIVERS HAVE A COORDINATED EFFORT SO THEY DON'T WIND UP WITH THE OCCURRENCE THAT YOU WERE. SPEAKING TO WHICH IS. I'M A CUMULATIVE IMPACT THAT WOULD HIT THE RIVER THAT WOULD CAUSE A MAJOR FLOOD TO THE COMMUNITIES DOWN FLOW. AND AS WE RECOGNIZE EACH OF THESE HAVE EIGHT BY THE BY THE GRAPH THAT WE SEE UP HERE ON THIS CHART IN OUR CHARTS ON HER DESK. WE SEE THAT THERE'S MORE CAPABILITY FOR TIME OF DISPLACEMENT THE TERM IS NOT REGULARLY USED OR HEARD BY THIS BODY. TIME A DISPLACEMENT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT FOR US TO HAVE SUCCESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WATER STATE. NOW WE JUST. WE WERE JUST LISTENING. TO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU NEED DECADES. TO REALLY STUDY. TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS UP. TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE TELL US ABOUT WHAT MAJOR CATASTROPHIC EVENT OCCURRED. ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. THAT WE KNOW CAN HAPPEN AND WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN IF WE DON'T CHANGE THE SKEW OF TIME A DISPLACEMENT BY HAVING. A QUANTITATIVE CHANGE IN STORAGE CAPACITY. SO THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN FLOOD WAS A WIDESPREAD FLOOD OF AND FOR BOTH SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SISTER WHERE -- BUT THAT WAS AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED BEFORE WE HAD THE FORECAST WHEN IT OPERATIONS PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE SO NOT TRUE. THAT WAS BUILT INTO THE FEDERAL REGULATION AND AND THEY MISTER TONY WAS RUNNING THAT SO KEEP GOING I'M GONNA I'M GONNA CHALLENGE ON THIS ONE OKAY. I WELCOME IS THERE YEAH I WAS THE GUY THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE THE CALLS -- PRE BEING ABORTED SUPERVISOR AS A LANDMARK. I WASN'T AFFECTED PARTY -- MOVING INTO -- THE MORE RECENT THOUGHT OF AS WE HAD SO THINKING ABOUT THE WATER THAT HAPPEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE COORDINATION CALLS THE JOHNS TEAM WAS WORKING WITH THE RESERVOIR OPERATORS WITH THE DOWNSTREAM COMMUNITIES. TO LITERALLY GO THROUGH AND DO EXACTLY DESCRIBED EARLIER WAS TO ENSURE THAT BASICALLY WE COULD. MEET HER OUT THE WATER ACCOUNT FOR THE ATTENUATION TIME THIS DISPLACEMENT TIME AS YOU CALL IT. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE EXCEEDING THE DOWNSTREAM CAPACITIES PARALLEL TO THAT -- THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WERE GOING THROUGH AND WHERE THEY NEEDED WERE AN ACTING EMERGENCY MEASURES ON THEIR LEVEES TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY WHERE THERE'S KNOWN LOW SPOTS ON THE LEVEES. GO THROUGH PROVIDE BASICALLY SOME ADDITIONAL BERMS OR SANDBAGS TO ADDRESS AND STRENGTH IN THAT SYSTEM IN THOSE WEAK POINTS. SO. WHAT OCCURRED IN NINETY SEVEN WAS ONE OF THE GREAT? INJUSTICES. BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT POINTS OUT OUR FAILURES -- TO PREPARE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON? A PAGE FIVE YOU SPOKE TO ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BUT IF WE TAKE A LOOK VERY LITTLE MONEY IS MISSING ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER IT'S ALL BEEN SPENT. IN THE SACRAMENTO REGIONAL AREA -- FOR IMPROVEMENTS THEIR RECOGNIZING THAT THE CHURCHILL A BY PASS HAS HOLES RIDDLED THROUGH IT AND ANY MAJOR. ADDITIONAL FLOOD THAT WOULD OCCUR THERE IS GOING TO HAVE A BLOW OUT THAT'S GOING TO WIPE OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IF NOT MORE -- WITH IT WITHOUT ANY HARDLY ANY NOTICE AT ALL. LET'S RECOGNIZE MISSED COOLEY JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF THIS TRIVIA -- THAT FLOOD. THAT OCCURRED HAD OVER SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND THE DESIGN CAPACITY IS AT TWENTY SIX ONLY TO GET TO THE SACK DAM. THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER TODAY CAN ONLY HANDLE EIGHT THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND. YOU CAN ONLY PUT A LITTLE OVER NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND AND THE BY PASS THOSE DON'T EQUAL. TWENTY SIX WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DIFFERENCE IT GOES AND IT SPREADS WILDLY IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ROOM MOST OF US HAVE DRIVEN ONE FIFTY TWO WE KNOW ONE FIFTY TWO HAS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BECAUSE WE CROSS IT. HOW FAR DO WE SEE ACROSS TO ABOUT THE WITH OF THIS ROOM? IT'S ACTUALLY ELEVEN MILES WIDE. BUT WE NEVER SEE IT FLOODED. BECAUSE WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB A MASTERING IN HARNESSING THE RESOURCE. THAT EXIST. BUT MR GRAY IS HEATING UP FABULOUS POINT HERE. THE LARGEST SNOW PACK. THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR US TO HAVE A GAME IS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER FOR FLOOD PROTECTION AND UTILIZATION. YET WORK STUMBLING OVER RECOGNIZING IT. AND ADDRESSING IT. WHY IS THAT NOT OCCURRING? IN A MORE HASTILY WAY. BECAUSE JUST AS WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT WAR BILL. WITH ITS FLOOD. WHEN IT WAS OCCURRING? WE WE DIDN'T THREATEN THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER WE NEED TO GET IT TAKEN CARE OF NOW. WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER. BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE. HAVE GROWN IN MASSES AND TO SAY THAT ONE COMMUNITY. AND ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE IS OF MORE VALUE THAN ANOTHER. KIND OF GETS TO THE SOMEONE'S CROSS. HOW CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT? OR DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HAVE DON'T HAVE RESPONSE THAT I DIDN'T THINK SO. WE'LL KEEP GOING WE'LL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. OR I CAN PICK ON HIM NOW. TO HAVE -- DO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS NUMBERS AT THIS JUNCTURE. SIGNAL TAKE OUR FIRST PANEL -- AND ALSO MENTION MEMBERS I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SEVERAL WEEKS AGO TO GO OUT AND TOUR THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS CENTER AND WAS -- VERY INTERESTING VERY INFORMED EXPERIENCE I WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ARRANGE IT -- AND THANK YOU ALL -- BOTH FOR THE INFORMATION BY THE TOUR AND THE TESTIMONY. HERE -- THIS AFTERNOON THANK YOU. OKAY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE -- TO ITEM THREE ON YOUR AGENDA -- FLOOD MANAGEMENT NOW THAT WE'VE COVERED THE OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA FOR CONTROL SYSTEM A WE'RE GONNA INVITE -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR PROTECTION BOARD EXECUTIVE OFFICER LESLIE GALLAGHER THE RECLAMATION DISTRICT ONE AWAIT DEPUTY MANAGER MEGAN MAGGIE AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CENTRAL FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION MILITARY. THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH HERE WITH US TODAY AND GO AHEAD AND PROCEED WITH YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LESLIE GALLAGHER I IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD. I WAS APPOINTED BY THE BOARD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SO I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW AT THE LAST TIME I WAS BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE THE WEST. TWENTY FIFTEEN SO. THANK YOU FOR INVITING US BACK. I KNOW THAT TO A CATASTROPHIC REVEREND FLOODING IS NOT THE ONLY DISASTER THAT WE FACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A FOCUS ON THIS. AND I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS -- TO JUST A A BIT OF A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- THAT DEPARTMENT SHOWED YOU A LOT OF THEIR GREAT TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE BOTH FOR GATHERING DATA AND FOR SUPPORTING DECISIONS I'M GONNA TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE ORGANIZE THE THE VENUES AND HOW WE CREATE THE POLICY THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. THE STATE'S STRATEGIC VISION FOR REDUCING FLOOD RISK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS A LOT OF AND HAS HAD A LOT OF INPUT FROM THE LOCALS WHICH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR FOR QUITE AWHILE AND I KNOW WE TALK ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY AS KIND OF A STARTING POINT AROUND THE FIFTIES WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOT INVOLVED. BUT ACTUALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD IN ITS -- PREVIOUS ITERATION AS THE RECLAMATION BOARD WAS ASKED TO STEP IN IN THE VERY EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY TO HELP DEVELOP THE WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS THE STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL. SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN OUT THIS FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS -- WE DID HAVE A PLAN BACK THEN IN NINETEEN ELEVEN WHICH WAS THE JACKSON REPORT AND I THINK TO UNDERSTAND REALLY WHERE WHY WE HAVE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT. WHY THE SYSTEM CAME ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT DID WE TOUCHED ON THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT IN THE FIRST PANEL -- WHEN THE BOARD WITH ASKED TO STEP IN AND DEVELOP A PLAN? TO TAKE OVER THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS -- WHAT THE OBJECTIVE WAS AT THAT POINT WAS TO DEAL WITH -- THE SEASONAL RIVER RAIN FLOODING THAT WE HAD WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE RIVERS WERE FLOWING FAST AND SWIFT TO GET RID OF THE MINING TAILINGS AND ALLOW FOR COMMERCE TO CONTINUE UP THE RIVERS. SO THAT'S WHY THIS BYPASS SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE I CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY. IF YOU JUST TURN AYE AYE HAS SENT A PACKET IF YOU TURN TO A KIND OF THE FIRST PAGE OF YOUR POCKET -- I I TOOK THIS FROM THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN PLAN BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A GREAT GRAPHIC TO SHOW WHAT HAS CHANGED IN A HUNDRED YEARS YOU LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC. THAT'S WHERE WE WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN YOU LOOK ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE ADOPTED THE MOST RECENT ITERATION OF THE PLAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IF YOU JUST TAKE A FEW SECONDS IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO PRE THROUGH THAT IT. WILL REALLY GIVE YOU A GOOD SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE. ALTHOUGH THESE THINGS ARE VERY COMPLEX THE BOARD HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE THE VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE VALLEY AS TO NOTED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN WHICH IS REALLY THE BLUEPRINT THAT WE ALL FOLLOW. AND I KNOW THAT CHAIR GARCIA WHO JUST HAD TO STEP OUT FOR A MOMENT IS -- EX OFFICIO ON OUR BOARD AND THIS IS HIS SECOND YEAR THAT HE'S BEEN DOING THAT SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S THE LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT IN OUR BOARD -- THE SEVEN VOTING MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE AND TO FOUR YEAR TERMS ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT DRIVE THE POLICY FOR THE BOARD AND SO. HAVING THAT INPUT -- FROM AND ABILITY FROM THE LEGISLATORS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS ALSO VERY HELPFUL FOR THE BOARD -- THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE NOW WAS DEVELOPED WITH EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND I'VE GOT SOME LOCALS HERE THAT HOPEFULLY ARE GOING TO ATTACHED TO THAT AND TELL YOU HOW AND HOW THAT. MAKES THE PLANIMPLEMENTABLE IN AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PLANNING EFFORTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE STATUS WE HAVE BROAD SUPPORT FOR THIS PLAN WHICH MEANS WE CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING WITH IT AND THAT'S AND NOT SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US THAT. THE BOARD. SO HOW ARE WE HANDLING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I MENTIONED I'M GONNA BREAK THAT DOWN JUST INTO THREE CATEGORIES WE HAVE -- REGULATORY AND OVERSIGHT. WE HAVE OUR NON FEDERAL SPONSORING ASSURANCES ROLE AND THEN MUCH LIKE THIS COMMITTEE HERE WE HAVE -- DRIVING THE VISION IN PROVIDING THE VENUE WHERE THOSE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS CAN HAPPEN -- I THINK YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WAS ISSUED LAST WEEK THAT REQUIRES THE STATE AGENCIES TO I THINK DIFFERENTLY AND ACT BOLDLY. TO DEVELOP A RESILIENT WATER PORTFOLIO IN THE FLOOD WORLD THAT SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING BY NECESSITY FOR AT THE OVER A DECADE NOW -- AND I WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT. THE BOARD UTILIZES ITS BROAD REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THE SYSTEM TO MANAGE AND OVERSEE MORE THAN A HUNDRED LOCAL ENTITIES WHICH INCLUDE RECLAMATION AND LEVY DISTRICTS COUNTIES AND EVEN OUR PARTNERS AT THE STATE WHEN THEY'RE AND MAINTAINING. MAINTENANCE AREAS THAT SECOND THIRD PAGE OF MY HAND OUT HAS THAT A GRAPHIC SHOWING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT RECLAMATION LEVY DISTRICTS AND JUST KIND OF SHOWS YOU I SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY ON BOTH THE SACRAMENTO IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. WE OVERSEE AND MANAGE ALL OF THOSE AND THEY IN TURN ARE OVERSEEING AND MANAGING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. WHEN WE ADOPTED THE LATEST ITERATION OF THE PLAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD BILL ANCHOR STATED THAT THE BOARD'S FOCUS WAS GOING TO BE ON TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW? AND FINDING A WAY TO PAY FOR IT. SO IN THE ROLE OF TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE THAT THEN YOU CALLED THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE. AND WE REALLY DRILL DOWN AND A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT WHAT OPERATIONSAND MAINTENANCE REALLY MEANS WHAT IS OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE THAT THE LOCALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SINCE THE STATE TURN THAT OVER TO THEM. AND THEN WHAT REALLY DO WE NEED TO LOOK MORE HOLISTICALLY WITH ALL OF US TOGETHER ON WHAT WOULD BE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR WHAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED -- SORT OF YOUR TYPICAL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND REALLY TRYING TO SOLVE SOME OF THOSE COMPLEX PROBLEMS THAT SOMETHING WE WORKED ON LAST YEAR WHICH RESULTED IN THE ISSUANCE OF BOARD RESOLUTION TWENTY EIGHTEEN DASH OF SIX WHICH THAT STANDARDS FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR GOAL IS TO GET. TO YOU COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE MANUALS THAT WE AS THE STATE SAID BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO. AND THEN FINDING A WAY THAT WE COULD SANTA VISE AND ASSIST THE LOCAL AGENCIES IN TWO GETTING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL PEEL EIGHTY FOUR NINETY NINE PROGRAM. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER -- THE STATE DOES HAVE LIABILITY FOR THE SYSTEM AND SO AS MUCH AS WE TRY TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDING TO HELP AND ASSIST WHEN THERE ARE -- DAMAGE TO THE SYSTEM THAT'S ONE WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT. THE JUST TO BRIEFLY TELL YOU ABOUT THE PL EIGHTY FOUR NINETY NINE PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE REPAIRS TO CATASTROPHIC FAILURES TO STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL LEVEES AND SO. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH THE LOCALS TO MAKE SURE THAT CAN HAPPEN AS WELL AS REESTABLISHING OUR COMMITMENT. TO DEALING WITH -- THOSE THINGS THAT ARE WITH ON WITHIN SPECIFICALLY THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION LIKE HANDLING FIFTEEN THOUSAND ENCROACHMENTS UPON THIS SYSTEM THAT STILL HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH THAT HAVE. CROPPED UP OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. WITH ALSO REALLY BEEN OUT THERE SHAKING THE TREES TRYING TO FIND THE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THIS -- THE AS YOU HEARD FROM RACHEL IN THE LA YELLOW -- MANAGING THE SYSTEM THROUGH BOND FUNDS AND AND THE OCCASIONAL GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION DOES NOT PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -- THANKS AND IN LARGE PART TO THE ALLOCATION THAT WE RECEIVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE BOARD IS COMMISSION DAY -- A STUDY TO SEE IF WE COULD. ARE RE UTILIZED AND REINVIGORATE THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN DRAINAGE DISTRICT WHICH BACK IN NINETEEN ELEVEN WAS SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD USED TO RAISE FUNDS. TO BUILD THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM AND TO MANAGE IT UP AND THREW UP THROUGH THE NINETEEN TWENTIES OF WE DID THAT SO -- WE APPRECIATED THAT -- AUTHORIZATION AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN NOTED THAT -- WE REALLY ARE ONLY SPENDING AROUND THIRTY MILLION ANNUALLY ON ACTUAL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND WE SHOULD BE SPENDING CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING TO TRYING CLOSE THAT GAP. IN OUR NON FEDERAL SPONSOR ROLE THE BOARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE NON FEDERAL SPONSOR WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS PARTNERING ON THESE LARGE SCALE SO SWITCHING OVER TO KIND OF THE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS IN. THE LAST DAM FOUR PAGES IN YOUR PACKET THAT I PROVIDED THAT THERE ARE THE FACT SHEETS. FOR THE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON GOING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT ARE BEING FUNDED BY THAT SPECIAL ALLOCATION SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THAT WAS A PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET -- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT WAS IN RESPONSE -- TO REQUEST BY IF THEY ALREADY TEAMS THAT TELLING THE ARMY CORPS THEY'VE GOT TO MOVE DIRT TURNED OR GET THESE THINGS BELT SO WITH THIS FUNDING AND WITH THAT IMPETUS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE ARMY CORPS IS TRYING VERY HARD TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY ON AMERICAN RIVER COMMON FEATURES ON THE FOLSOM DAM REYES. THERE'S TULE RIVER PROJECT AND THEN ALSO IN THE U. BUT BASS AND AND THAT'S WHERE THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT SO THE BOARD IS PARTNERING ON THAT AND THOSE ARE SOME VERY EXCITING LARGE SCALE PROJECTS BUT IT'S ALSO REQUIRING US AS THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID TO SORT OF THINK. DIFFERENTLY RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH HOW WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH WITH A HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR ALLOCATED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY GOT A GLASS ALL AT ONCE AND THEN YOU HAD TO REALLY RETHINK HOW YOU'RE DOING IT. DESIGNING BUILDING CONSTRUCTING ALL AROUND ALL AT THE SAME TIME SO -- ALL OF THE PARTNERS ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS -- ON THE VENUE SIDE OVER THE PAST DECADE WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF MEETINGS AT THE BOARD AND THIS IS WHERE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING THE LOCAL INTERESTS WE HAVE A A LOT OF PARTNERS TO SHOW UP TO THAT NOT JUST -- THE MAINTAINERS THAT YOU SEE HERE TODAY BUT NGOS -- COME THE PART OF HOW THE CONSERVATION STRATEGY WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ITERATION OF THE PLAN IS BECAUSE WE HAD A GROUP OF OF NGOS COME UP AND SAY WE REALLY NEED TO DO THIS THIS IS YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP THESE -- THE ECOSYSTEM UP LIFT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING WE CAN MEASURE THAT AGAINST AND NOT SOMETHING WE'RE STARTING TO WORK ON AND YOU SHOULD BE SEEING THAT -- FOR THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE PLAN AS WELL. I KNOW YOU WERE INTERESTED IN CLIMATE CHANGE -- AND I TO TALK ABOUT JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE WHERE WE WERE IN THAT IN THE PAST AND TO GIVE A LITTLE SHOUT OUT TO ONE OF THE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS THAT WE MANAGE THAT I KNOW IS A IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MELINDA TERRY'S HEART -- FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS -- WE HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERING THE DELTALEVY SUBVENTION PROGRAM AND THAT IS FOR BOTH PROJECT AND NON PROJECT LEVEES. AND THAT HAS BEEN BY A REALLY ANY MEASURE AS SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM -- JUSTIN IN MANAGING THAT THE REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND KEEPING CATASTROPHIC VILLAGE FROM HAPPENING MAYOR -- AND IT'S REALLY BEEN A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE SO I MEAN A LOT MELINDA TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE --AND JUST KIND OF LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THOUGHT TWENTY EVENTEEN WAS A VERY WET WINTER YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WE HAD THAT YOU SAW THE VERY COLORFUL ATMOSPHERIC RIVER GRAPH. AND THAT DROVE A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THOSE HIGH WATER EVENTS. AND EVEN THOUGH -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IS STEPPING INTO THE P. LED FOR NINETY NINE PROGRAM TO PAY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE DAMAGE FROM THAT AND THAT IS DAMAGE WITHOUT A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE THOSE ARE JUST THE THE SLIPPAGE IS IN THE EROSION AND THE AND THE OTHER -- FLOOD FIGHTING PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD. THE STATE STILL I HAVE TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OR SO RIGHT AND TWO YEARS LATER WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO HOW TO MANAGE THAT HOW TO FIX THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THIS YEAR AGAIN WE HAVE HIGH WATER ALTHOUGH NOT THE SAME KIND OF HIGH WATER WE HAD TWENTY SEVENTEEN AM AS YOU'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED AT LENGTH WE HAVE VERY HIGH SNOW PACK IN THE SIERRA BOTH. IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH. AND THE FLOOD SEASON IN THE SAN JOAQUIN RUNS THROUGH JULY FIFTEENTH SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE AT SPECIAL ATTENTION TO YOU KNOW NEARLY ALL SUMMER IS HOW ARE WE GETTING HOW IS THAT SNOW GOING TO GET OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND SAFELY THROUGH THE SYSTEM. SO ENSURING RESILIENCY THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGE IS SOMETHING WE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON FOR QUITE AWHILE OUT OF NECESSITY JUST BECAUSE OF HOW THE SYSTEM CAME CAME ABOUT AND HOW THIS IS HOW WE'VE HAD TO MANAGE WE'VE DONE THESE CAREFUL PLANNING -- EFFORTS AND WE'VE GOT TO ITERATIONS OF THE FLOOD PLAN NOW I CARRY MINE AROUND WITH ME AND IT'S ALL DOGEARED AND AND HAS A LOT OF POST ITS ON IT BECAUSE WE WE ACTUALLY DO USE THAT -- A LOT WITH OUR WITH OUR EFFORTS AND HOW WE PRIORITIZE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT. HAVE COME UP THAT THE BOARD IS DEALING WITH AND THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PLAN AS WELL -- THERE'S SOME REALLY EXCITING DISCUSSIONS GOING ON ALSO ABOUT THE NEXUS BETWEEN FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND THINGS LIKE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- YOU CAN LOOK FOR SOME OF THAT COMING UP IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. SO I JUST WANT TO INVITE YOU TO KIND OF LOOK AT OUR WEB PAGE IF YOU GET A CHANCE WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION ON THERE WE HAVE ALL THE BOARD MEETING SCHEDULES WE ALTHOUGH. ALSO BROADCAST THE BOARD MEETINGS -- ANY OF THE AGENDA ITEMS THAT ARE COMING UP THAT ANYONE HAS A PARTICULAR INTEREST AND WE'D BE. HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THAT WITH YOU. AND I JUST WANT TO KIND OF LEAVE YOU WITH -- KNOWING THAT THERE IS A COLLABORATION OF LOCAL FEDERAL AND STATE PARTNERS THAT THIS IS ALSO ON THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN CHARGE OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT WE REALLY ARE AND I'M THINKING VERY BROADLY. PLANNING VERY CAREFULLY AND COLLABORATING WIDELY AND AND I TAKE HEART IN THE FACT THAT THAT'S HAPPENING -- SO I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND COME BACK AND REPORT. WHEN WE FINISHED GREAT TO SWITCH OVER TO ME TO QUESTION? I'M GONNA GO AHEAD OF ME AGAIN -- HI MELINDA TERRY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION -- WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX AND LESLIE HAD IN ONE OF HER PAGES ALL THOSE RECLAMATION DISTRICTS AND THE TWO SYSTEMS WE DO NOT REPRESENT ALL THOSE BUT WE DO HAVE -- OVER SEVENTY MEMBERS THAT ARE FROM LIKE THE CHICO MAYBE DOWN TO TRACY SO WE DON'T COVER THE UPPER SAN JOAQUIN. A PART OF THAT SYSTEM -- BUT WITH A LARGE SO PACKED THIS YEAR WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE BEING INVITED IN THE FACT THAT YOU ALL ARE THINKING ABOUT IT -- WHEN I STARTED MY JOB ONE OF THE THINGS I WENT DID WAS THE TOUR AT THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS CENTER SO I WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE CHAIR DID AND I DO ENCOURAGE THE STAFF AND OTHER MEMBERS TO DO THAT -- IT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND IT'S YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S HELPFUL AND TELL YOU LOOK THE MATH AND APPRECIATE ALL THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THIS IS THE LOGICAL COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THAT IT'S SCARY AND ALL THE TIME -- AND THAT'S WHAT MY MEMBERS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT I YOUR INTRO COMMENTS WERE JUST PERFECT IF I THINK SETTING THE FOUNDATION FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HEAD ON OUR COMMENTS -- TO AND AS YOU HEARD THIS IS REALLY AN X. EXTENSIVE -- SYSTEM -- AND THE STATE DOES HAVE LIABILITY OUR MEMBERS ARE THE LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES RECLAMATION DISTRICTS. AND COLMAR DIS AND BUT THE STATE ALTERNATELY STILL MAINTAINS THAT LIABILITY THE PATERNAL LAWSUITS -- SOMEBODY TO ASK QUESTIONS EARLIER IT WAS THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THERE WAS A LEVEE FAILURE OF OUR PROJECT WE CALL PROJECT LEVEES OF THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL -- IT ENDED UP IN COURT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS SO IT WASN'T SETTLED UNTIL ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR AS I RECALL. IF YOU CAN REMEMBER OR CONNIE DECLINED AT THAT POINT BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION HOUSING AND COLLAPSED -- IT WAS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT -- WILLS INTERESTS THAT HAD ACTUALLY CRUDE OVER THAT TWENTY SMOKING HERE'S BUT THE STATE'S TOTAL FOR FOREIGN FORTY MILLION STATE AND HAVE THAT MONEY WE WERE WE WERE IN HARD ECONOMIC TIME BUDGET TIMES -- THEY PAID OUT OVER TEN YEARS SO IT IT CAN GET YOU KNOW VERY EXPENSIVE -- AND SO IT'S THAT WHOLE PREVENTION OF THING IS IS WHERE WE COME IN OF THE MAINTENANCE TO HELP REALLY TRY TO MAINTAIN IT. GET OUT AHEAD OF IT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO A BE CAUGHT UP BECAUSE IT'S LIKE YOUR LAUNDRY YEAH YOU MAY HAVE DONE LAUNDRY YESTERDAY BUT YOU'RE WEARING CLOTHES BEING SOCIABLE FAMILY SO. GUESS WHAT YOU GET TO DO YOU IN A COUPLE DAYS SO IT'S JUST A CONSTANT STATE AND IT'S ABOUT ANTICIPATING WHAT'S COMING. A HEARING LOVING. THE OTHER LEFT -- BUT IT'S A ANYWAY OUR OUR MEMBERS REALLY DID -- SIGN THESE AGREEMENTS WITH THE STATE AS WELL TO BE THEIR LOCAL PARTNER IN THAT -- IN ADDITION LIABILITY THE STATE. THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE THERE ARE NOT RECLAMATION DISTRICT SALUTE ALAMAIN. AND SO THE STATE ACTUALLY DOES MAINTAIN SOME OF THE LEVEES THEY HAVE OPERATIONS THAT DO THAT I I WANT TO SAY THERE'S NINE OR TEN OF THEM -- THAT THEY DO HAVE TWO MAIN AREAS THEY MAINTAIN THEMSELVES THEY'RE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THOSE BY PASSES. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YOLO AND CENTER AND HIS BILL THESE SEVEN BY PASSES THAT'S A RELIEF VALVE. YOU CAN IMAGINE A REALLY BIG WHAT EVENTS WHEN THEY PHILIP YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SENTIMENT DEBRIS SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE THINKS ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES. YOU KNOW ON THE STATE SIDE AND FOR KEEPING THE CHANNELS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT MAPS THAT SHOW THE DESIGN CAPACITY FOR THE FLOOD FLOWS. BUT WHEN YOU GET SETTLEMENT STUFF COMING IN EVERY YEAR YOU'RE LOSING THAT CAPACITY RIGHT SO THERE IS A LOT OF MAINTENANCE JUST BE ON THOSE LEVEES THAT I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE -- WILL THINK ABOUT -- OUR MEMBERS A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR MAIN SINCE OF NON PROJECT LEVEES IN THE DELTA -- AS WELL BUT ESSENTIALLY OF MY MEMBERS WORK REVOLVES AROUND ONE PARADIGM -- AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT EVERY WINTER -- ARE LEVEES ARE GONNA EXPERIENCE WEAR AND TEAR. EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THEN SOME YEARS ARE WORSE THAN OTHERS -- BUT EVERY YEAR THAT WILL HAPPEN SOME THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT. I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THE INCREASE FUNDING THAT YOU HEARD TALK TO BUY BY THE LA HELLO -- THIS AT NEW CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN THAT WE HAVE -- THEY REALLY PAID OFF -- WOULDN'T HAVE LEVEE FAILURES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND YOU KNOW KNOCK ON WOOD WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE SOME THIS YEAR DESPITE THE RISKS YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND FACING -- SO I MEAN TO ME THAT IS A REALLY GOOD THING IT WE SHOULDN'T EVER FORGET THAT THAT RISK IS THERE BUT IT IS STILL A VERY GOOD THING -- A MAJOR REASON I THINK FOR THE COMBINATION OF THIS FUNDING AND THE PLANNING IN MY OPINION AS HURRICANE KATRINA -- IT WAS A DISASTER AND A NIGHTMARE FOR NEW ORLEANS BUT IT REALLY ENDED UP -- BEING MOTIVATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE ADOPTION OF THE SOCIAL BALLOT FLOOD PROTECTION THAT WE PLAN AND WE ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING. AND THE VOTERS APPROVED A FLOOD ONLY BOND THAT YEAR OF THE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND I THINK IT WAS RATE YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE REALLY. AFTER THAT SUBSEQUENTLY WE SEEN ADDITIONAL -- BOND FUNDING BUT IT'S A SMALL PORTION OF WATER BONDS THAT ARE BONDS ARE FOCUSED ON WATER SUPPLY -- BUT AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE STATE WE HAVE DROUGHTS AND FLOODS I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE OUR REALITY THAT WE LIVE IN. BUT THERE'S SO THERE'S SMALLER BOND FUNDS THAT GO TOWARDS THAT THAT FLOOD RISK IN THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD MORE STORAGE -- BUT AGAIN IT ENDED UP KIND OF A GOOD CASE SUCH SITUATION -- THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FEDS TO PAY FOR SOME STUFF BUT THE ONE THING THAT THEY DON'T I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE FEMA OR THEIR ARMY CORPS THEY DON'T PAY FOR MAINTENANCE? THAT'S ALL ON US BETWEEN THE STATE IN THE US -- THAT'S ALL ON US THEY DON'T PAY FOR THAT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK FOR THAT MEAN INSTALLERS -- WE DID TALK ABOUT THE INCREASED OF RECOGNITION THAT WHEN THE BOND FUNDS AREN'T THERE WE DO HAVE TO GO TO GENERAL FUND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN IGNORE. THAT MAINTENANCEIN THOSE GIVEN YEARS AND THIRTY MILLION IS NOT ENOUGH THAT HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IS REALLY WHERE WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS -- BUT THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION IN THESE MONTHLY MEETINGS WHERE WE REALLY DO TALK ABOUT THE HARD STUFF THERE -- BUT AS WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEAS OF CREATING DUE TO THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY CREATED TWO NEW FUNDING PROGRAMS FOR MAINTENANCE. AND SO NOW WE'VE GOT OPPORTUNITIES OF WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN ACTUALLY DIRECTLY APPROPRIATE MONEY WHICH THAT DELTA LEVY SUBVENTION PROGRAM THAT SHE MENTIONED HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL OVER TOPPING OFF WAS VERY COMMON IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. FEMA GOT VERY UPSET AT THE STATE -- AND WE HAVEN'T HAD OVERTOPPING IN THE DOUBLE TO SENSE THAT PROGRAM CAME AND THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM CAME INTO PLACE. AND THE LEGISLATURE DOES DIRECTLY APPROPRIATE FUNDING TOWARDS THAT AND THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD WAY TO GO -- WE ARE CHALLENGED WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR COST YEARS WE DO HAVE TO DO PROP TWO EIGHTEEN UNLIKE THE STATE FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE AREAS -- SO WE DO HAVE TO GET LAND OVER APPROVAL WHEN WE DO NEED TO RAISE OUR ASSESSMENTS AND THAT CAN BE A CHALLENGE PARTICULARLY IN THE URBAN AREAS WHERE WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE AGENCIES. WE TYPICALLY HAVE -- WHERE I LIVE WE HAVE LITTLE JUST A SAFE CAR WAS SAFE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A LARGER AGENCY THAT'S DOING BIG CIVIL WORKS IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE RECLAMATION DISTRICT THAT ONCE THOSE PROJECTS ARE DONE? THEY TURN OVER FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE RECLAMATION DISTRICTS BUT YOU GET CHARGED TWICE IF YOU'RE A LANDOWNER WITHIN THAT AREA FROM TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND THEY'RE LIKE WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I'M GETTING CHARGED. FROM TWICE FOR THE SAME THING FLOOD -- SO THEY HAVE TO COORDINATE WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO DO THERE BECAUSE EACH GONNA NEED TO DO TO EIGHTEEN THERE'S A LOT OF CHOREOGRAPHY THAT HAS TO GO ON LOCALLY -- THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION AT THE FLOOD BOARD THOUGH IN OUR COORDINATING COMMITTEE MEETINGS I HAVE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF STATE AGENCIES IN MY ROLE. FOR THE ASSOCIATION AND I WILL SAY THE IT IS VERY NEEDS THE AMOUNT I THINK OF INCLUSION THAT THEY HAVE THAT THEY ACTUALLY INCLUDE THIS AND WHEN WHERE THEY'RE DEVELOPING THINGS -- AND THE AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY SO YOU KNOW WE DO GET A REALLY GOOD PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS WHY WERE ABLE TO THEN GET THAT LOCAL SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION THAT LESLIE -- TALKED ABOUT. SOME. THE I DID PROVIDE A HAND OUTS -- WHICH JUST BECAUSE YOU HEAR US TALK ABOUT DAMAGE TO LEVEES EROSION SEEPAGE I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE SOME PHOTOS I KNOW I'M THAT TYPE OF PERSON IN ADDITION A NEW. TREND THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS I WENT MY OUTLOOK TO LEVEES AND LIKE I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S THE KIND OF DAMAGE AND IT WAS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE HAVE NOT FINISHED DOING THOSE REPAIRS AND UNDERSTAND AS THESE HIGH WATER. THE WATER STAYS HIGH WE CANNOT SEE THE DAMAGE BEING DONE THIS YEAR BUT WE KNOW IT IS BEING DONE -- LESLIE -- MEGAN'S GONNA TALK INITIAL TALK ABOUT HOW WATER LEVELS GO UP AND DOWN IT'S THE EROSION IS OCCURRING. BUT IF WE CAN'T SEE IT UNTIL JULY WE HAVE A VERY SHORT WINDOW TO DO THOSE REPAIRS. SO IN ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MONEY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO APPROPRIATE FOR MAINTENANCE OF ITS SYSTEM YOU NEED TO ANTICIPATE MAYBE THIS YEAR. ON PUTTING SOME MONEY TOWARDS THE REPAIRS. THAT WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN JULY AND THE BEGINNING OF THAT OCTOBER YOU KNOW FLOOD NOVEMBER YOU KNOW FLOOD SEASON REALLY STARTING -- AND I THINK BEING ISN'T TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE ONES THAT. ARE DOING THAT THAT -- THE DAILY PATROL AND SO YOU HEARD ABOUT THE C. DECK IN THE GAUGES THEY DO GO ONLINE AND LOOK AT THOSE DAILY. AND THEY DO HAVE WITH RICK USUALLY EACH DISTRICT WILL HAVE OKAY WHEN LET'S SAY I STREET BRIDGE GETS TO THIS LEVEL THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GONNA START OR TWENTY FOUR HOUR PATROLS RIGHT. SO THEY THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GONNA START DOING THOSE THINGS AND THEN THEY START MARKING AND PAYING ATTENTION -- BUT THEY THEY ACTUALLY DO THOSE AND OUR FEAR OR THINGS LIKE HAVING THAT LARGE SNOW PACK AND A PINEAPPLE EXPRESS COME THROUGH -- THE REALLY HOT DAYS THEY'RE JUST GONNA -- MELTED SO FAST -- BUT YOU DO HAVE TO BE CONCERNED YOU KNOW WHETHER THIS IS OUR NEW NORM OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH THESE VERY SCARY NUMBERS WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PIECE OF PAPER WHO WOULDN'T BE AFRAID. TO DO LIKE YOU SAID IT JUST TAKES COMMONSENSE TALKED ABOUT IT IT DOESN'T TAKE IN A CIVIL ENGINEER. STAND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THAT IT'S A LITTLE SCARY OUT THERE -- OF I THINK I'VE HIT ON THAT -- I WANT TO PUT IN A PLUG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS OF IS YOU KNOW NOT PART OF MY MEMBERSHIP BUT WHETHER YOU'RE THE LARGE RIVER SYSTEMS THEY'RE ALREADY TRAINED THEY KNOW HOW TO LATE OF THE SCREEN. THEY KNOW HOW TO SAND BAG PROPERLY HOW TO LAY IT PROPERLY AND FAST AND THEN FOR THE CREEK SYSTEMS THAT THE THE CURSE SOMEONE OR SEE IT TALKED ABOUT. THEY'RE ALSO REALLY CRITICAL IN THOSE LOCAL AREAS FOR THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST SO FAST AND I THINK THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR REALLY HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE AND I DON'T CARE RICH FLAVOR IT'S FIRE TO I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST TRAINED ALREADY THEY'RE JUST A GREAT -- ENTITY TO HAVE -- THE I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT SO. THOSE THINGS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE NEW PROGRAMS I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU JUST WITH THREE WORDS TO THINK ABOUT -- ONE IS VIGILANCE THEY'RE JUST REALLY IS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE THAT'S NECESSARY -- TO REDUCE THE RISKS TO QUALIFY FOR THAT FEDERAL REPAIR FUNDING FROM BOTH PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW THAT WE DID OUR MAINTENANCE. AND ALSO TO RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THE SECOND WORD IS SYNERGY -- THE FLOOD BOARD LIKE I SAID IT HAS A PLAN FOR THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL -- INCLUDING THE EXPENDITURES THAT ARE REALLY NEEDED -- FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND WE HAVE SUCH REAL IMPRESSIVE LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND COOPERATION -- THAT YOU JUST DON'T SEE ANY OTHER STATE AGENCIES AT LEAST I DON'T AND THIRD WORD IS CONSISTENCY. IT'S AN AND THAT I REALLY JUST MEAN IT'S ABOUT RELIABLE APPROPRIATIONS -- BOND FUNDING IS NOT THAT RELIABLE SO HOPEFULLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN GET USED TO SOME LEVEL OF GENERAL FUND. A YOU KNOW AS A BASELINE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE WE LOOK AT HOW TO USE THOSE BIGGER FUNDS WHEN THEY COME IN. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MEGAN NEED GEE I'M THAT RECLAMATION DISTRICT ONE AWAIT DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER FOR FLOOD CONTROL. I DO IN THE DISTRICT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AFTER A TWENTY YEAR CAREER AT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS -- WHERE I SERVED AS THE EMERGENCY MANAGER FOR THE SACRAMENTO DISTRICT AND LEADER AS THE LEVY SAFETY PROGRAM MANAGER OVER INSPECTIONS AND PERMITTING? SO -- HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN RT WHEN I WAIT AND JUMPED ON THAT OPPORTUNITY TO TO REALLY GET INTO BE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND -- WHICH IS REALLY FUN TO BE HONEST IS TO TO BE THE FRONTLINE -- THIRTY ONE AWAIT WAS FORMED IN -- EIGHTEEN SEVENTY JUST TWO YEARS AFTER THE RECLAMATION DISTRICT LAW -- THEY WERE FORMED TO BUILD LEVEES AND RECLAIM LAND FROM OWNERS THAT OVERFLOWED NEARBY RIVERS. IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN TO NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE KNIGHTS LANDING RIDGE DRAINAGE DISTRICT AND THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WEST SIDE LEVY DISTRICT -- LARGELY BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU WANNA WAIT WAS REALIZING THEIR BUILDING LEVEES THAT WERE MOVING FAR BE BEYOND -- THEIR DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. AND SO. THEY CREATED -- THESE TWO OTHER DISTRICTS TO BETTER REPRESENT THE LANDOWNERS THAT WERE BEING PROTECTED -- WE CALL THOSE SISTER DISTRICTS -- AND WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER AS THREE DISTRICTS -- SINCE THE INCEPTION -- WE WERE COST EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY TO OPERATE OVER NINETY MILES OF LEVEES THAT SPAN FROM COLUSA -- DOWN TO JUST SOUTH OF KNIGHTS LANDING WHICH FEEDS INTO THE YOLO BYPASS. IT PROTECTS OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF PRIME FARMLAND AND SEVERAL SMALL COMMUNITIES. IT'S LOCATED IN -- LOWER POLICE COUNTY AND NORTHERN YOLO COUNTY. WE MANAGEMENT STAFF OF FOUR AND A TOTAL STAFF OF ABOUT -- TWENTY FIVE AND I SERVED AS DEPUTY MANAGER FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE DISTRICTS THAT I MENTIONED -- SO IN ADDITION TO FLOOD AND DRAINAGE ON WE DO DRAINAGE AS WELL AND ARE YOU WANT TO WAIT -- PARTY ONE WAY ALSO HAS A WATER SUPPLY MISSION AND WE PROVIDE WATER TO ABOUT FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND IN COLUSA AND YOLO COUNTIES. SO LIKE MOST OTHER LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES WERE A LAND OWNER RUN WORK -- AGENCY WE HAVE A BOARD OF FIVE COMMISSIONERS ARE TRUSTEES THAT ARE ELECTED BY LANDOWNERS -- AND WE IMPLEMENT THE DAILY OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THOSE NINETY LET -- NINETY MILES OF LEVEE. SO IN THE SIMPLEST FORM MANY ASSUME THAT -- LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCY SIMPLY GOES OUT AND SPRAYS THE WEEDS AND MOST THE GRASS AND KEEPS THE ROADS NICE AND CLEAN AND AND DOES THE LEVEE PATROLS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BUT IN REALITY WE DO WAY MORE. THAN THOSE EVERYDAY ITEMS -- SO WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR PRODUCTION BOARD -- AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES -- AS YOU'VE HEARD -- WE'VE ALSO WORKED REALLY HARD TO FOSTER CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COUNTIES IN YELLOW AND COLUSA COUNTY -- WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE HELP DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY -- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE RIVER WE'RE VERY CLOSE WITH OUR NEIGHBORS IN ALREADY FIFTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY IN -- SIXTEEN SIXTY WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM -- WE ARE THE MIDDLE OF OUR DISTRICT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE IS THE TUESDAY -- BY PASS IF THAT IS THE BY PASS DOESN'T FUNCTION GUESS WHAT THE WATER GOES DOWN THROUGH MY LEVEES AND PROVIDES GREATER RISK AND SO THE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS THE TISDALE. BY PASS AND OUR NEIGHBORS ACROSS THE STREET ARE KEENLY AWARE SO WE ALL WORK TOGETHER IN THAT REGARD -- WE ALSO WORK WITH JUST OTHER ALL THE OTHER LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT AND ESPECIALLY THOSE IN WHAT WE CALL THE MID NUMBER SACRAMENTO RIVER REGION -- SO ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT STEPPED FORWARD TO BE THE LEAD AGENCY -- FOR WHAT WE CALL THE MIDDEN UPPER SACRAMENTO RIVER REGION -- AS PART OF REGIONAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT PLANNINGTHAT STEMMED OUT OF THE TWENTY TWELVE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN. WE ARE ONE OF SIX REGIONS -- AND SO WE BRING TOGETHER A VARIETY OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP THE STATE IN THE UPDATE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN -- OR PARTICULAR REGION COVERS A SEVEN COUNTY AREA OR PRETTY BIG AREA -- AND I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE REGIONS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCALS WAS LARGELY THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN HAVING THAT LOCAL INPUT -- AND REALLY BEING COLLABORATIVE IN THAT UPDATE MADE THAT A SUCCESS -- SO ONE OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO REGIONALLY IS REGIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANNING -- JOHN'S PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED GRANTS FOR MANY AREAS -- WE ESTABLISHED AS PART OF OUR GRANT UNIFIED COMMANDS FOR BROADER AREAS THAN JUST OURSELVES SO WE'RE TALKING. TO EACH OTHER AND WE SPENT TWO COUNTIES AND LET ME TELL YOU IF I COULD CHANGE THE COUNTY LINE AND BE SO MUCH EASIER IT IS SO COMPLICATED THAT TAKE. TO CROSS THE COUNTY LINE IS A SPECIAL DISTRICT JUST FROM FEMA FUNDING FOR IT JUST EVERYTHING IS MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING. I MEAN IF ONE OF OUR LEVEE BREAKS IN COLUSA COUNTY IT IT'S NOT GONNA STOP COUNTY LINE ROAD. IT'S GOING TO CROSS IT AND GO INTO YOLO COUNTY SO -- THAT GRANT HAS BEEN HUGE IN HELPING US WORK BETTER TOGETHER AND BECOME CLOSER WITH OUR COUNTY -- YES OFFICES. I'M PART OF THAT ESTABLISHED -- STOCKPILE MATERIALS WE BUILT CONTAINERIZED FLOOD FIGHT MATERIAL THAT WE USED IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE WROTE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLANS WHICH YEAH UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME MY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB WAS THE FIRST DAY LEVY PATROL IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I CAME IN. YOU KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW ANY LANDMARK I KNEW LEVEES I HAD BEEN WORKING IN IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE LOCAL AREA AS WELL -- AND WITHOUT THAT PLAN. I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXECUTE AS WELL SO THOSE EMERGENCY RESPONSE GRANTS HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL -- SO. WE ALL THE OTHER PART OF THE GRANT WE CREATED ALL OF WHAT I'M CALLING ON THE FLY FLOOD FIGHT TRAINING -- SO WE CAN GO TRAIN OUR FARMERS WHICH WE HAVE OUR WE'VE GONE TO SOME OF THE LARGER FARMS WE'VE TRAINED THEIR FARMWORKERS WITH AN ONLINE VIDEO IN FOUR HOURS TO BE ABLE TO HELP US WITH OUR FLOOD FIGHT SO. FOR IF WE CAN'T USE THE SEE SEE SEE WE CAN GO TO OUR LOCAL FARMERS AND SUPPLEMENT OUR STAFF DURING TIMES OF EVENT -- AND IT'S IT'S IT JUST MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE TO INVEST IN THE PLANNING NOW. THAN IN THE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AFTERWARDS AND WE SEEN IT THE MIDWEST THIS YEAR. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD TO RECOVER FROM THAT ECONOMIC DAMAGE AND SO IF EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO PLAN AND PREVENT THAT IS CRITICAL. SO PART OF THAT AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS PROGRAMS FOR REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE AND SO MANY GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT IN NUMBERS. SO WE JOINTLY WITH SEVERAL OTHER RECLAMATION DISTRICTS JOINED TO DEVELOP WHAT'S CALLED A SYSTEM WIDE IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK. IT'S BASICALLY A DOCUMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AS A GET WELL PLAN. THIS IS ALL THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE NEED TO FIX THIS IS OUR PLAN FOR FIXING IT AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT AS A TEAM THEY LOOK THEY DON'T LOOK AT EACH RECLAMATION DISTRICT SEPARATELY. THEY LOOK AT PROTECTED AREAS SO MY PARTICULAR AREA THAT ALREADY ONE AWAY AND SACRAMENTO RIVER WEST SIDE LEVY DISTRICT ARE PART OF HAVE THREE OTHER LOCAL MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES. TO STAY ELIGIBLE THAT WHOLE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES HAS TO BE GOOD. SO WE HAVE TO WORK TO GET HER -- WE SPENT UP -- ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PUTTING TOGETHER THE PLAN -- IT'S STILL GOING THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS BUT WHILE IT GOES TO THAT APPROVAL PROCESS YOU REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FEDERAL FUNDING. TWENTY SEVENTEEN HEAD. OUR BASIN WAS ELIGIBLE FOR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING. I LOVE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT. NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS COMMENTS AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REINVEST EVERY YEAR. BUT IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT [inaudible] SO. WE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM AND THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ALL THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY HAS TO GET TAKEN CARE OF SO. WE'VE THE BOARD HAS MELINDA SAID IS BEEN PUTTING DOWN A COORDINATING COMMITTEES AND AND DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AND AND SO ONE OF THE RECENT COMMITTEES. AS THE INSPECTION COMPLIANCE WORK GROUP HOW DO WE GET TOGETHER. TO TO MAKE ALL OF OUR JOINTLY WORK TOGETHER TO FIX ALL THESE MAINTENANCE DEFICIENCIES AND SO WE'RE STARTING ON THAT AND I HAVE GREAT HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO MINIMIZE COSTS FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. THEN WE CAN I'M NOT SPENDING MONEY IN ANOTHER IDEAS IT'S BEEN MANY ON THE SAME THING LETS YOU KNOW POOL OUR RESOURCES -- TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS YEAR YOU KNOW ITTHIS YEAR'S FLOOD EVENT I THINK WAS REALLY DECEIVING -- DECEIVING BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WORK WE HAVE A CATASTROPHIC FAILURES RATE SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE THERE'S GOING TO BE DAMAGE AND IT VERY WELL MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT AND IT'S STILL UNDER WATER IN MANY. PLACES I KNOW IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY ARE ARE RIVERS WILL COME DOWN -- THE SAME JOAQUIN YOU KNOW IT'LL STAY UP FOR AWHILE AND SO WE WON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT A REVISION -- DAMAGE THAT WE HAVE UNTIL THOSE RIVERS RECEIPT -- AND I I WAS COMPARING TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN A LITTLE BIT AND NOTICED THAT THE FLUCTUATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON WAS MUCH MORE DRAMATIC THAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICHMEANS. THE RIVERS GO UP AND DOWN A LOT WE SEE MORE RUSSIAN WHEN THE LIVER'S LIVE EAST IRWIN THE REVERSE JUST STAY UP LIKE THEY DID IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SEE A LOT MORE SEEPAGE. WHICH YOU CAN SEE EASIER DURING THE EVENT THE EROSION. WE WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE -- SO THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON WE IT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT. AT LEAST IN OUR AREA WE PATROLLED FOR FIFTY DAYS THIS YEAR LEVY PATROL WHEN WE GET SEAT ACT AND WE HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER WE GOT A LEVY PATROL WE PATROLLED FOR FIFTY DAYS THAT'S ONLY TWO DAYS LESS THAN IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'VE EXCEEDED OUR OUR EMERGENCY PATROL BUDGET BY THREE TIMES -- AND SO FAR WE DON'T HAVE AN A FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO RECOUP A LOT OF THOSE CONTROL COSTS WE DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM. TO RECOUP THOSE COSTS SO THAT'S JUST LESS MAINTENANCE THAT WE CAN DO. I'M THE CORE IS ALSO NOT OPENS THE P. ONLY FOUR NINETY NINE PROGRAM YET THIS YEAR WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL OR NOT -- BUT ALL THOSE DAMAGES MAY NOT HAVE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN REACH INTO AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MORE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE STATE AND LOCALS. BECAUSE THE DAMAGE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET FIXED -- SO. YOU KNOW I I CAN'T WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE DAMAGE MORE DAMAGE AND WE ALREADY HAVE A BACKLOG OF DAMAGE FROM -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO AS MELINDA STATED THAT YOUNG THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN THE URBAN AREAS. WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS THE SYSTEMS HAS REALLY REALLY WORKED -- BUT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIX THE OUTSTANDING STORM DAMAGE -- IF WE WAIT THEY JUST GET MORE EXPENSIVE THEY DON'T GET THEIR ON THEIR OWN IT JUST GETS MORE EXPENSIVE. AND WE ALSO NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THE NEXT DISASTER AND LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT'S NEXT -- PROTECTING OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES AGRICULTURAL AREAS THE THAT COMMUNITIES SUPPORT AGRICULTURE IS KEY -- WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AS THE NEXT AREA -- SO WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THE FLOOD INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE THE ELEMENTS CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH AND WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AS THE STATE AND LOCALS AND THEN WE NEED TO RELY ON EACH OTHER. TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE SYSTEM -- OUR INVOLVEMENT AT THE LANDOWNER LEVEL BRINGS A FORM OF COST EFFICIENCY. TRUST IN ACCESS THE JUST THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST CAN'T GET -- THE AMOUNT OF TRUST THAT ARE LOCALS HAVE WITH THE R. D. IS -- IS IT'S HUGE AND AND SO WE CAN PROVIDE THAT. AVENUE FOR THE LOCALS AND AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THE STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND ALSO BE THE VOICE BACK TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. SO WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD IN SYNC ALLOWING US TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL AND WERE ALWAYS -- WE WE'VE DO WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF COLLABORATING MORE BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS DO MORE SO WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND TRYING. TO ACT AS ONE RATHER THAN A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ENTITIES -- WE NEED TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS -- AS I SAID IT THE PLANNING THAT WAS DONE IN OUR REGION -- WAS PHENOMENAL -- BUT IT IF YOU DON'T PRACTICE IF YOU DON'T TRAIN IT GOES STALE SO WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER ROUND OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE GRANT WE WILL KEEP THAT GOING IN OUR REGION BUT THAT'S CRITICAL TO KEEP UP -- AND WE NEED TO CONVINCE CONTINUE INVESTING IN OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND AS LESLIE SAID TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE HAVE WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT WE HAVE -- SUPPORTING THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT HELP THE FLOOD MAINTENANCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM REPAIR PROGRAM THOSE ARE TWO HUGE PROGRAMS -- THAT THE STATE HAS PUT TOGETHER THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARDS THOSE PLANS AND ULTIMATELY SO WE CAN REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR THAT FEDERAL FUNDING. IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO MOVE FORARD AND WE DON'T SHOW PROGRESS. GUESS WHAT WHAT WE BECOME AN ELIGIBLE AGAIN NO MORE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT -- AND SO INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS CLIMATE CHANGE YOU KNOW IMPACTS THE SAME IN THE FREQUENCY AND THE INTENSITY OF THE STORMS MIGHT CHANGE AND SERVICES EVER MORE IMPORTANT -- AND AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THE URBAN INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS AND IT'S TIME TO TO MOVE TO OUR SMALL COMMUNITY IS THE NEXT BIG LIABILITY FOR THE STATE -- BECAUSE THERE ARE ALSO POPULATIONS THERE THAT -- ARE AT RISK AND SO -- YOU KNOW ALL THE PLANNING AND DATA COLLECTION AND COORDINATING. IT'LL ALL BE FOR NOT IF WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF WHAT WE HAVE A MODERNIZE FOR THE FUTURE -- AND SO EVERYTHING WE DO WORKS TOWARDS -- REDUCING STATE LIABILITY AS WELL AS REDUCING RISK FOR OUR OUR LANDOWNER ANYTIME WE REDUCE RISK IT IT REDUCES THE STATE LIABILITY SO WORKING TOGETHER SKI -- AND ULTIMATELY WE ALL WANT TO MAXIMIZE THAT FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. THAT'S ALL I HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S NICE TO HEAR THE ENTHUSIASM IN YOUR VOICES -- FOR FOR THE JOBS THAT YOU DO AND THE HAVE APPRECIATION FOR COLLABORATION THAT CERTAINLY BEEN. OUT FOR THE REGISTER HERE TODAY I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION -- TO ASK D. W. R. TO LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON BOTH -- YOU KNOW WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY SAFETY -- THE GOVERNOR'S OPPOSITION EXECUTIVE ORDER ALONG THE SAME LINES -- SO A LOT OF ATTENTION. ON THIS ISSUE AND FRANKLY. I THINK WE ARE. CAUGHT UP IN WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE STALE POLITICS OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHERE THIS ENTIRE DISCUSSION -- HAS THE ELEPHANT THE ROOM OF DAMS VERSES NO DAMS. AND THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT VERSUS -- ALL THESE OTHER KIND OF TECHNICAL ISSUES IN THE WATER SIDE THE REALITIES AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M A BELIEVER THAT WE NEED -- ACROSS THE BOARD COLLABORATION. MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN REGIONS -- AND WE NEED TO MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND IS TO BE KIND OF THE ANSWER TO CALIFORNIA'S WATER QUESTION TO BE ALL THE ABOUT RIGHT. ENGAGE ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ENGAGE CONSERVATION BUT ALSO LEAVE ON THE TABLE THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS FOR BOTH FLOOD MANAGEMENT LONG TERM WATER SUPPLIES RELATES -- TO YOU KNOW THE THE INCREASED -- I'M RELIABLE -- CLIMATE CHANGE FACTS RIGHT. DOES THIS NEW DAMS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE FULSOME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX YOU KNOW WAS NEWER IT MADE THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE THEY ACTUALLY LET IT FILL UP HIGHER THAN ITS DESIGN STANDARD AND FRANKLY. CROSS THEIR FINGERS BECAUSE THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE WAS TO EVACUATE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM SACRAMENTO BUT THANK GOODNESS IT WAS THERE. YOU KNOW THAT I GOT PLANNED FOR AND IT WAS AVAILABLE. BECAUSE MAYBE YOU KNOW I WELL I HOPE IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE PLANNING AND LIKE YOU SAID THINKING AHEAD. OR THINGS GONNA GET DIFFERENT AND WE NEED TO PLAN FOR MORE. TAKE CARE WHAT WE HAVE THE DO WE NEED MORE THAT'S POSSIBLE. EXACTLY. JERRY GARCIA I HAVE A QUESTION AND THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH. HOW SOME OF OUR SMALLER DISTRICTS ARE? OF FAIRING WHEN IT COMES TO MAX IS SEEN THE DOLLARS WERE EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH. MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. P. M.. I DON'T THINK WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE NARROWED DOWN HOW MUCH HAS GONE TO SOME OF THE SMALLER DISTRICTS IN. RURAL CALIFORNIA BUT I GUESS I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE SAYING DIRECTLY -- SO THAT AS WE ARE ROLLING OUT THESE DOLLARS AND CRITERIAS -- WERE MAKING SURE THEY WERE KEEPING IN MIND -- THOSE -- SPECIFIC HER HURDLES RIGHT THAT PRESENT THEMSELVES IN NOT SO MUCH JUST THE WORLD THE BIGGER -- URBAN AREAS GET ALL THE MONEY LET LET'S GET MORE SPECIFIC TO SO WHAT ARE EXACTLY THOSE A CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN IN THAT PROCESS. I WILL SAY THAT AGAIN AFTER KATRINA AND THE LEGISLATURE DID THE LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE FLOOD PLAN -- THE OTHER THING IT REQUIRED WAS FOR THE URBAN AREAS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SYSTEM ANYWAY TO GET UP TO TO IT TO ENTER YOUR LEVEL OF PROTECTION BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND SO THEY'VE ALL THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY STATE FUNDING IN PARTICULAR WAS GOING TO THE TOWARDS THAT AREA BUT ALSO BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE HIGHER. RISK OF LOSS IS IF YOU WILL SO IT BUT WAS WITH THE INTENTION THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU DO HAVE TO THEN TAKE EVERY OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES A LITTLE BIT OF THE SIMILAR THING WE'VE SEEN THAT SOMETIMES OF THE NEWER PROJECTS ARE WANTING TO DO. ARE IN THE URBAN AREAS AND TRYING TO GET TO THEIR COST BENEFIT RATIO THAT THEY REQUIRE FOR THESE RURAL AREAS IS IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT. BUT I'M ON ALL IT MEGAN HIT UPON THAT I WILL SAY IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE DELTA. AS I MENTIONED FOR FORTY YEARS WE'VE HAD THE DELTA SUBVENTIONS PROGRAM FOR MAINTENANCE AND WE HAVE ONLY HAD TWO FAILURES IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND NONE OF NEW FEELINGS FOR OVERTOPPING SINCE IT'S BEEN. IN PLACE -- AND AND WE DO HAVE THESE TWO NEW PROGRAMS JUST RECENTLY CREATED BY DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THAT REALLY ARE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RURAL AREAS -- TO START ACCESS SCENE AND I AGAIN A LET ME AGAIN MAYBE YOU'VE HAD ON HOW THEY USE THAT BUT THAT'S THOSE ARE THE USEFUL FUNDING TOOLS. BUT THEY NEED TO BE FUNDED. SO I THINK SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- AT MIL MELINDA MENTION THE TWO EIGHTEEN ELECTION PROCESS RATE THAT CREATES A CHALLENGE -- IN. IN BRINGING IN THE ASSESSMENTS AND ESPECIALLY IN OVERLAPPING DISTRICTS SO I MENTIONED THAT I'M DEPUTY MANAGER FOR THREE DISTRICTS WILL LOT OF THOSE LANDOWNERS OF THE SAME. SO THEY HAVE OVERLAPPING ASSESSMENTS FOR LEVY MAINTENANCE -- ON TOP OF THAT YOU'VE -- WE'VE ADDED THE CIGNA THE GROUND WATER. ACT WHICH IS IT ANOTHER ASSESSMENT THAT'S GOING TO BE LAID UPON. THE SAME LANDOWNERS AND THEN WE'VE -- THIS IS A REALLY FUN PROTECTION BOARD IS LOOKING AT THE SACRAMENTO SEEM LOOKING DRAINAGE DISTRICT WHICH IS POTENTIALLY ANOTHER ASSESSMENT. SO IS IS ALL OF THESE ASSESSMENTS GET BUILT ON EACH OTHER IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS -- IT WERE LESS ABLE TO GENERATE LOCAL DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY THEY JUST. THERE SOME YOU MIGHT THEY CAN VOTE NO. RIGHT. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT. TO TO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR ASSESSMENT THROUGH AND IN SOME AREAS -- REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS I MEAN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT COST AND SO FOR FOR A LOT OF THE COSTS AND WITH REGULATORY -- ELEMENTS IS IS A DOLLAR LESS IN IN MAINTENANCE AND WE'RE SEEING IN SOME OF WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE FOCUSING A LOT ON TIGHT. REPLACEMENTS AND PIPE PICTURE A BIG RESTORE LEVEES THEIR OLD RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM IS OLD -- THERE ARE SOME TYPES THAT YOU THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY IS TO TAKE THEM OUT AND THE COST OF DOING ALL OF THE PERMITTING. EQUALS THE COST OF REPLACING THE PIE. AND SO IT IT THOSE CHALLENGES JUST MAKE IT HARD FOR A LOCAL DISTRICT TO EFFICIENTLY. OPERATE AND MAINTAIN -- THEIR SYSTEM. SO AT SOME POINT WILL BE ASKED TO CONSIDER ANOTHER WATER BOND INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT. AT SOME POINT. IF YOU WERE WRITING IT BUT WHAT WOULD THOSE MAYBE TOP. THREE CRITERIAS LOOK LIKE -- NOT CONSIDERING THAT YOU PROBABLY WOULD SAY I WANT TO DIRECT ON OCCASION. TO THESE DISTRICTS RIGHT BUT WHAT WOULD BE KIND OF THE TO BE. TOP CRITERIAS THAT YOU FEEL WOULD ALLOW DISTRICTS LIKE YOURS TO TO COMPETE WELL RIGHT TO FOR OFF. WELL IT WITHIN THE A DISTRICTS OF SIMILAR YOU KNOW NATURE SO. TO HEAR THAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT -- SO. AT THE DISTRICTS HERE EVERY DISTRICTS IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT FINANCIAL SITUATION I THINK WE NEED -- TO WE NEED TO POSITION OURSELVES BETTER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME -- YOU KNOW I'M WE DON'T DO A LOT OF PREPARING WE KNOW WHAT OUR DAMAGE STAR ARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SITE SORRY WE KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE. AND IF WE HAD -- THE ABILITY TO ACCESS STATE FUNDS NOW TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE AND PERMIT AND IN DESIGN A LOT OF THOSE THINGS WHEN ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES COME UP. YOU CAN JUMP ON IT -- THE FEMALE HAS THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM THAT YOU KNOW FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY ISSUE IN -- PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THE STATE GETS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY BACK THAT WE CAN DO MITIGATION. YOU KNOW WHAT WE APPLIED FOR ONE OF THOSE ACTUALLY GOT IT WE WE WERE TOLD WE WERE. GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT WE WE TRIED WE HAD TO DECLINE BECAUSE WE ARE THE PROJECTS WE THINK WE'RE GONNA GET IT -- BUT IT SHOWED THAT WE CAN. AS LONG AS WE'RE PREPARED. AND SO IF WE CAN PREPARE IF WE CAN POSITION OURSELVES AND BE BETTER STRATEGICALLY PLACED TO ACCESS ALL OF THOSE GRANTS WE CAN BETTER LEVERAGE BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY. I'M I ANSWERED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY SO WHAT. MY MEMBERS WOULD SAY WE WERE PRIDE GO BACK TO THE WORDING THAT WAS IN THE FLOOD ONLY BOMB THE PROP. ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE IT HAD THE TYPES OF CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD WANT. TO YOU KNOW SPEND THE MONEY ON AND WHEN WE LOOK BACK YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH THAT ONE ANY YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT THESE NEWER BONDS ARE. HAVING DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND KIND OF GOT AWAY FROM SOME OF THOSE CATEGORIES -- SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND REALLY LOOKING BACK AT THAT LANGUAGE. YEAH I THINK A LOT OF THE NEWER BONDS HAVE BEEN ALL MULTI BENEFIT. AND WHAT IN. OUR DISTRICT IS MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS SO THOSE ARE GREAT BUT NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE FLOOD RISK REDUCTION PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE DONE -- BUT AND THAT'S WHY I SAY THERE IS CATEGORIES THAT INCLUDED THE SYSTEM THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR BY PASSES AND SUCH [inaudible] RESPOND. TO HERE IS H. U. EVALUATE -- FLOOD RISK AND MITIGATION. ON FOOT PRESQUE. TWO CAN CIRCLE BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS I GAVE YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. MY CONTINUE FRUSTRATION THERE WATER POLICIES JUST TOTAL LACK OF COLLABORATION AND A TOTAL -- LACK OF UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW THE RIGHT HAND LEFT AND NEED TO BE DOING THE TO BE COORDINATED. AND GIVEN EXAMPLE. WE PASSED THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY ACT. LEGISLATURE DRESS THE THE CRISIS FOLLOWING YOU KNOW EXTENDED PERIOD DROUGHT THAT WE HAD COLLAPSING AQUIFER'S THROUGHOUT CENTER I THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IN THAT VERY LEGISLATION WE PROHIBITED -- RECHARGE OF GROUND WATER AS A BENEFICIAL USE FOR DISTRICTS ACTUALLY PUT WATER -- INTO THE GROUND OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE -- NOW THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICS BEHIND THAT POLICIES ARE HAS TO DO WITH URBAN AREAS WANT THEIR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO AS FAR AS GETTING THEIR WATER DOWN. TO THE URBAN AREAS AND IF YOU GOT A BUNCH OF RURAL. DISTRICTS PUTTING WATER INTO THE GROUND IT'S NOT MOVING -- SOUTH SO THERE'S REASONS FOR THOSE DECISIONS BUT THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY SOMEWHAT HYPOCRITICAL INCONSISTENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ME FLOOD RISK AND WATER SUPPLY ART. DISCONNECTED RIGHT AND WHAT'S INTERESTING BOTH IN THE PANEL THAT WE HAD BEFORE THIS PANEL AND IN DURING THIS PANEL IS. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THERE'S TALK ABOUT COLLABORATION BUT I'M NOT SURE WE'VE GOT SHARED GOALS. IF THAT MAKES SENSE AND AND I KIND OF WONDER HOW. HOW COULD WE TAKE THOSE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS INTO AFFECTS THE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT FLOOD RISK AND I WAS LOOKING FOR EXAMPLE TO LA OWES? HAND OUT -- FROM EARLIER TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW FLOOD RISK IN A IT BREAKS DOWN OR YOU KNOW NUMBER OF RESIDENTS NUMBER OF STRUCTURES CROP VALUE. RIGHT. WELL IF YOU TAKE THE SACRAMENTO RIVER THE SAN JOAQUIN AND TULARE LAKE JUST JUST THOSE. THREE YOU'VE GOT A COLLECTIVE CROP VALUE OF ALMOST SIX BILLION DOLLARS. THE ENTIRETY OF THE REST THE STATE HAS A CROP VALUE OF ONE POINT. FIVE RIGHT -- SO WE'RE TALK ABOUT CROP VALUE. EIGHT AND OF COURSE FOOD SUPPLY AND WHAT THAT MEANS LONG TERM -- AND THAT'S ALSO A SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUE -- THAT'S ARE WE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION NECESSARILY IT SOUNDS LIKE IT SO I GUESS HOW DO WE WHAT CAN WE DO AS A LEGISLATURE TO ASSIST. YOU TO ASSIST YOU HAVE YOU ARE TO ASSIST. YOU KNOW THE WATER COMMISSION I MEAN EVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A WATER BORDER WATER COMMISSION D. W. R. FLOOD CONTROL AND EVERYTHING'S IN A DIFFERENT PLACE RIGHT SO. FROM THE LAY PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE THE LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE TO SYSTEMS EVEN SET UP FOR A LOT OF COLLABORATION SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO I REALIZE THAT WAS ALL ALARM. QUESTION WITH A LOT TO UNPACK BUT I HAVE THE SAME THOUGHTS ALL THE TIME AND THE REASON IS THE OTHER HAT THAT I WEAR IS I'M ALSO THE MANAGER OF THE NORTH. DELTA WATER AGENCIES SO WE DEAL WITH WATER SUPPLY ISSUES AND SO I GO TO MEETINGS FOR ABOUT FIVE MEANT WATER SUPPLY TAKE MEETINGS AND MATT FLED. AND AND I USED TO WORK RESOURCES AGENCY AND I'M LIKE YOU I JUST KEEP IN MY MIND I KEEP THINKING WHY ARE WE MAKING THESE SYNERGIZE TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE CAN BE COMPLETELY COMPLEMENTARY. AND IN SOME RESPECTS WE DO BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE REST RESERVOIRS PROVIDE BOTH FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER SUPPLY BUT YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT DID OF YOU ARE THEY DO HAVE TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTORS YOU KNOW ONES WATER SUPPLY AND YOU NO ONE'S GOT ALL THE OTHER INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT WHICH I THINK. INCLUDES YOU KNOW FLOOD CONTROL -- AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK. I I THOUGHT BY WHERE STRUGGLE WITH WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP IS I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT WOULD AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE. YOU CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE YOUR COORDINATION INTERNALLY YOU KNOW AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THESE I THINK LIKE ANYONE WERE WE GET CAUGHT UP AND WE GET STUCK ON HAVING TO RESPOND. TO THE EMERGENCIES OUR WATER SUPPLY SIDE THE DROUGHTS COME IN NO CENTERS OUT DROP CAM I GUARANTEE YOU WHAT COMES RIGHT AFTERWARDS AS THE FLOOD. YOU KNOW AND SO AS A DEPARTMENT WE SEE THAT THE INTERNALLY THEIR STAFF. THAT MIGHT EVEN WORKING FLOOD OPERATIONS HAS TO GO WORK ON SOME DROUGHT STUFF FOR A FEW YEARS AND THE ONE THAT'S OVER THE FLOOD DOES COME NOW PEOPLE CHANGE. AND SO WERE OFTEN REACTING AND NOT HAVING I THINK AS MUCH TIME AND ABILITY TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE OKAY NOW WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE HOW DO WE REALLY START MAKING IT WORK TOGETHER. I DO THINK THAT'S PART OF THEIR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT IF YOU WILL IT IS ON THEIR MIND AS PART OF THEIR WATER PLAN THEY THEY CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT UNDERSTAND IT -- THEY THERE YET NO I WOULD I WOULD WHAT I WISH I HAD IS THAT WHERE YOU GOT AT THE END WHICH IS WHAT WAS MY RECOMMENDATION. TO ME TO YOU ON WHAT DID WE ARE COULD OR SHOULD DO. THAT'S THE PART MAYBE I STRUGGLE WITH A LITTLE BIT MAYBE MAYBE LESS. HAVE THE ANSWER. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ANSWER BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT. OUR BOARD PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING TO EVERYONE -- AND WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IS THAT BUILDING ON THE SUCCESSES THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE SO WE HAVE THIS MANDATE NOW TO DO THESE MORE INTEGRATION AND MORE RATE ADDING MORE RESILIENCE I'M LOOKING MORE AT HABITAT THINGS THAT WE HADN'T DONE IN THE PAST. WELL WE'VE GOT TEN YEARS OF PLANNING EXTENSIVE PLANNING LOTS OF FUNDING THAT'S GONE INTO THIS AND WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD PLAN THAT ALREADY WORKS SO WORK FROM THERE AND EXPAND THAT OUT. WE CAN ADD IN THE FLOOD MAR WE CAN ADD IN THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY ACT TO WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE AND SEE WHERE THE GAPS ARE AND WORK ON FILLING IN FROM THAT DIRECTION RATHER THAN TRYING TO START ALL OVER AGAIN WITH THE HOLISTIC PLAN AND WORK DOWN SO -- THAT'S CERTAINLY A STRATEGY THAT I THINKCAN WORK -- I WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER THAT WHO HAVE THE ABILITY AND AUTHORITY OUTSIDE OF THE FLOOD WORLD SO. THAT'S ONE OF OUR CONSTRAINTS IS THAT WE HAVE A JURISDICTION IN A MANDATE THAT INCLUDES -- THE FLOOD WORLD SO IT'S IT'S NOT UP TO THE BOARD TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT GROUND WATER AND OTHER THINGS EXCEPT WHERE THOSE NEXUS ARE SO. SO -- THE POWERS THAT BE BEING ABLE TO DO THAT AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE SOME -- INFLUENCE AND IT'S ALREADY IN THAT AREA I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START. I WOULD. CHOOSE A LITTLE BIT TO SAY WHAT WHAT WHY SEE THE BENEFIT OF NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL. IN EXISTING. DIRECTIONS AND PLANS. YEAH WE TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN HALF AND ASK PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ IT. AND TELL ME WHERE THE PLAN PART IS. BECAUSE IS GIVING SAMPLE I'M FORTY ONE YEARS OLD AND IN MY LIFETIME THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA'S ALMOST DOUBLED. OUR WATER SUPPLY HAS INCREASED THE STATE AND FEDERAL INVESTMENT WASH WAS INCREASED BY ABOUT 1%. WHEN YOU DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE? AND YOU INCREASE YOU WASH BY BY IT SHOULDN'T BE REAL HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S PROMISE RIGHT. AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE OPERATE IN SILOS FUND MANAGEMENT VERSES WATER QUALITY VERSUS ACTS -- I THINK WE'RE MISSING OUT ON OPPORTUNITIES UP TO SAY GO ABOVE AND BEYOND EVEN JUST -- WATER RIGHT -- THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HYDRO MAKES TOWARDS REAL WINNER SHE IN THE SERIOUS THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS A MAJOR SUBJECT -- THE GETS LOST IN THIS IN THIS SAME WASH RIGHT SO WE COULD BE SOLVING MULTIPLE PROBLEMS -- BY MAKING SOME THESE INVESTMENTS AND AND CREATED GREATER COLLABORATION -- AND BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO OPERATE IN SILOS IN VARIOUS AGENCIES AND NOT NECESSARILY COLLABORATE COMMUNICATE -- I THINK WE'RE MISSING A WHOLE LOT OF REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES I THINK IT IS HAPPENING LOCALLY A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW I THINK LESLIE BROUGHT UP IN HER COMMENTS EARLIER. OF THE RECOGNITION NOW THAT THE STORM WATER CAPTURE YOU KNOW AND BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE OF WE CAN RE USE THAT WATER AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE RECHARGE AND SO I KNOW AT LEAST LOCALLY THEY'RE STARTING TO DO THAT YOU KNOW WHETHER WE'VE GOT A HANDLE ON IT. IN THE BIGGER SENSE LIKE YOU'RE ASKING YOU KNOW THAT'S WERE DEFINITELY I THINK IMPROVEMENT COULD OCCUR. THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH THE AS I SAID EARLIER THE GOVERNOR'S ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER -- SEEMS TO BE PUSHING OUT LOOKING FOR THE KIND OF COLLABORATION -- THAT I'M SPEAKING OF SO I'VE GOT ONE FEELING AT THE MOMENT SOMEWHAT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT. THE TEAM UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND THE INTEREST IN AT LEAST -- IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW THESE PATHWAYS TO COLLABORATE OCCURRING AND REALLY HAVE A A STRONG WATER PLAN FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. I AM HOPEFUL. TO AT THINK -- TO THE THE REASONS THAT I MENTIONED THE THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT REGION'S AT LEAST UP IN OUR AREA YOU KNOW THOSE DO THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THAT -- WHILE THE FOCUS MAY BE FLOOD ARE ALSO WATER SUPPLY FOLKS MAY NOT WE HAVE A WATER SUPPLY MISSION IN OUR DISTRICT -- AND THE THE COUNTIES IN OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THAT SO WILD WHILE IT MIGHT NOT BE DIRECT. THERE IS ALWAYS A WATER SUPPLY THOUGHT IN THE BACK OF MOST OF THOSE FOLKS MIND AS WE AS WE PLAN AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M I'M LESS AWARE OF SOME OF THE OTHER REGIONS AND AND IF THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE -- IS MIX OF I THINK I WERE ONLY ONE OF FOR RECLAMATION DISTRICTS THAT HAS WATER SUPPLY MISSION SO MOST RECLAMATIONS ACTUALLY DON'T. HAVE A WATER SUPPLY MISSION -- BUT WE'RE LUCKY IN THAT WE DO AND IT DOES IT IT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO KIND OF THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY ABOUT ALL. GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER AND FLOOD IN AND ALL OF THOSE COMBINED. OKAY REALLY DIGITAL QUESTIONS ARE FOR THE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS PRECIADO YOUR PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S HEARING. AT THIS TIME MEMBERS WERE GONNA MOVE TO OUR FINAL PANEL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. AND WE HAVE -- THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING PATTERSON PREVENTION CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AS WELL AS THE CHIEF OF EMERGENCY SERVICES -- OFFICER FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY SO WELCOME -- PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS TINA CURRY AND ONE OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTORS AT CALLOW YES AND I OVERSEE PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS -- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS -- ANGLE OF THIS OF THIS TOPIC AND TO BE HERE WITH -- ONE OF OUR COUNTIES -- WHICH IS A BIG ROLE IN THE STATE I'LL START WITH IN IN A MERCY PREPAREDNESS IS TO SUPPORT. THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND BY EXTENSION THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THAT IN ALL ASPECTS OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IN ALL THE HAZARDS THAT WE FACE -- FLOOD IS DEFINITELY -- ONE THAT HISTORICALLY -- AS WE'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE DAY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT IT'S AFFECTED EVERY COUNTY IN SOME WAY -- OVER HISTORY AND IS RESULTED IN A LOT OF LOSSES AND CERTAINLY -- A LOT OF STE -- MERGES YOU DECLARATIONS AND AND RESPONSES I'M SO IT'S IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO BE READY FOR THAT. AND I'LL JUST SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT SORT OF HOW WE FRAMERS HE PREFERS A CALIFORNIANS SPECIFIC TO FLAT AND CERTAINLY WANT TO GET TO YOUR QUESTIONS FIRST AND FOREMOST AS WELL AS MY CO PANELIST HERE. SO PLAN PREPAREDNESS FOR AS FAR AS WE LOOK AT THAT AND EMERGENCY SERVICES SPANS A LOT OF THINGS PART OF THAT IS PLANNING. ON HAVING EMERGENCY PLANS SO THAT WERE READY AND UNDERSTAND -- WHAT ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND WHAT TYPE OF RESPONSE WE MIGHT NEED TO UNDERTAKE TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT PROPERTY BUT ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE TRAINING AND EXERCISES? INCLUDES RISK REDUCTION IT'S ALL THOSE THINGS TO GET READY FOR EMERGENCIES SO THEY ARE LESS IMPACTFUL -- FOR ON THE PLANNING SIDE WE HAVE A STATE EMERGENCY PLAN THAT ARTICULATES OUR SYSTEM RESPONSE THINGS LIKE MUTUAL AID HOW RESOURCES MOVE AROUND THE STATE TO DEAL WITH MULTIPLE HAZARDS. AND WE'VE ALSO -- DONE A NUMBER OF WHAT WE CALL CATASTROPHIC SCENARIO PLANS FOR EARTHQUAKE -- AND ALSO FOR FLOOD HAZARDS HOW WOULD A VERY AND LARGE FLOOD EMERGENCY. THAT AFFECTS A LARGE SWATH OF THE STATE HOW THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COME TOGETHER TO RESPOND TO THAT AT TO SUPPORTER COUNTY SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO EXAMINE THE SCENARIOS. SO THE CAN REALLY LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT EITHER WE HAVEN'T FACED IN A LONG TIME OR THAT WE HAVEN'T FACED AT ALL. UNDERSTAND HOW WE MIGHT HAVE -- TO COME TOGETHER TO RESPOND TO THAT EFFECTIVELY -- IN TERMS OF PLANNING WE ALSO HAVE A NEW ROLE AT CALLAWAY YES THE RESULT OF THE OROVILLE EVENT AND THAT IS TO OVERSEE THE EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS BY ALL THE REGULATED. DAM OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S A VERY DIRECT -- ROLE THAT SOUNDS THAT WERE WORKING WITH THOSE OWNERS AND BY EXTENSION THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THOSE DAM -- INUNDATIONS MIGHT IMPACT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT DAM ISSUE IF THERE WERE TO BE A PROBLEM OR FAILURE HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THE COMMUNITIES DOWNSTREAM. HOW THEY WOULD NOTIFY -- PEOPLE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WHAT'S OUR SYSTEM OF OF EVALUATING DAMS CONSTANTLY TO UNDERSTAND -- THAT WHAT YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE SAFER WHETHER THERE'S A PROBLEM EMERGING AND THEN TAKING THOSE PLANS AND WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE THEN PART OF THE FABRIC OF THEIR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN AND THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS -- DAM SAFETY SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT NEWER TO AS I WANTED TO MENTION THAT. FOR TRAINING AND EXERCISES WE HAVE A A PROGRAM TO HELP EMERGENCY PERSONNEL -- ACROSS THE STATE THOSE DOES CHANGE SOMETIMES SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE FRESHEN UNDERSTAND HOW EMERGENCY RESPONSE WORKS IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SPECIALTY AREA SO THERE'S DIFFERENT POSITIONS THAT -- THERE ARE INVOLVED IN AND THEY NEED TO BE READY -- AGAIN WE AT THE STATE ARE PREPARED TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES INTO SEARCH THEIR CAPACITY MOVE RESOURCES AROUND THE STATE TO HELP ANOTHER THAT'S HAPPENED A LOT IN THE FIRES -- RECENTLY AND IT'S HAPPENED A LOT AND OTHER HAZARDS WE'VE HAD. CAN FINALLY I MENTION ANOTHER PLAN THAT WE HAVE IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S CALLED THE STATE MITIGATION PLAN -- THAT IS ONE THAT ARTICULATES THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO RISK REDUCTION AND INCORPORATES ALL THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO FIRE. EARTHQUAKE AND THE DIFFERENT HAZARDS WE FACE AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE DOING TOWARDS BUYING DOWN AT RISK AND LAYERED ON TOP OF THAT HOW CALIFORNIA'S CHANGING. CLIMATE INCREASED POPULATION ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED TODAY NEED TO BE KIND OF RE RE -- LOOKED AT BY CALLAWAY YES OVER TIME SO THE UNDERSTAND THE RISK IS CHANGING ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT -- NECESSARY TOOK IN OUR HISTORY FOR THE TYPE TO HAVE THREE PHASE BUT THEN L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G THAT OVER HOW&lt;/c&gt; CALIFORNIA ITSELF IS CHANGING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CONSTANTLY RESETTING -- WHAT THAT COMMITMENT TO RISK REDUCTION IS -- SO THAT WAS JUST A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO SOME OF THE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE -- I KNOW THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ME ON ON SOME SPECIFICS OF HOW WE UNDERTAKE RECEIVER FAIRNESS BUT I WANT. TO GIVE A CHANCE FOR THE OTHER PANELISTS -- AND THEN TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS -- AS YOU WISH OR RIGHT NOW HOWEVER YOU PREFER. THANK YOU.

TO TO KIND OF RESPONSE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD TODAY -- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS INVOLVED IN -- EMERGENCY TYPE OF WORK AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED SINCE EIGHTY SIX INTO THE IN THE FLOOD SO FOR ME SIX ALL THE WAY TILL TODAY. AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S BEEN A HUGE -- IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF COOPERATION COORDINATION THAT GOES ON IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- IS STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S GOVERNMENT SO IT DOESN'T NOTHING HAPPENS QUICKLY -- BUT I WILL TELL YOU IS IS GOOD IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT THERE WAS WHEN I STARTED IN MARIN CITY MANAGEMENT. AND FAR SERVICE -- WITH THE LOCAL LEVEL WE HAVE TO COORDINATE AND COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE -- ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE -- WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL -- GOVERNMENTS FROM THE RECLAMATION DISTRICTS OF THE CITY IS -- SPECIAL DISTRICTS -- AND THEN WE WORK. IT IN PARTICULAR WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITHCALLAWAY US AND CALIFORNIA D. W. R. -- IS THERE SUPPORT THAT HELPS US MAKE -- WHAT WE DO SO SUCCESSFUL? THE THE COUNTIES AND I'M SPECIFIC TIME A SECOND ROUND OF THE OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL HAVE -- HUGE RESPONSIBILITIES TO PRY PROTECTION -- TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WITHOUT. THE WORK OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE WORK OF THE PARTNERS THAT WE WORK WITH AS WELL AS THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE COULD NOT DO WHAT WE DO TODAY -- HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST KIND OF BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY AND HOW WE WOULD -- OUR SUPPORT OF IT WE DO COLLABORATE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- IN THE STATE -- THE STATE PROVIDES A LOT OF THE TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN ARMORED SEE OPERATION CENTERS WHENEVER WE HAVE A DISASTER OR ARE LARGE INCIDENT -- STATE E. W. R. HAS PROVIDED US WITH A LOT OF FUNDING -- TO HELP US TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVEN'T PREPARE OUR COMMUNITIES -- FOR FACING A FLOOD EVENT -- I KNOW JOHN PASHA EARLIER AND MENTION THE FACT THAT -- HE HE COR COOPERATION COORDINATES WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE IS -- HIS OFFICE AND IN DOING RECENTLY IS WORKING WITH US TO PROVIDE A LOT OF THE FLOOD PROTECTION EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES THAT ARE NEEDED DURING AN EVENT WE'RE TAKING THESE THINGS -- PURCHASING IT THROUGH GRANT FUNDING AND WE'RE TAKING THESE THINGS AND WERE STRATEGICALLY LOCATING THEM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY ESPECIALLY IN THE IN THE DELTA AREA. AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO ALL THE GOVERNMENT SO THEY CAN -- USE THAT EQUIPMENT AND THE SUPPLIES IN THE FLOOD -- EMERGENCY SO -- THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH -- COUNTY HAVE YOU ARE ON WE ALSO WORK WITH ANOTHER THINGS LIKE -- SUFFER PROGRAMS -- TELLS MODEL EVENTS -- WE WORK WITH THEM ON ONE SOFTWARE MET A MOLLY THAT THEY'LL HELP US US IF WE FIND -- AREAS WITHIN OUR OUR LEVEES THAT NEED TO BE -- ADDRESS WE CAN SIMULATE A FAILURE AT THAT LEVEL IT WITH LEVY AND WE CAN ACTUALLY MODEL WHERE THE WATER WILL GO AT THE RATE OF THE SPEED OF THE SPREAD. THE DEPTH OF WHAT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS IS IN THIS WAY SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT -- WE DO IN PARTING WITH THE STATE TO HELP US AND LOCAL LEVEL THE SAME PROGRAMS OBVIOUSLY HELP THE STATE AT AT THEIR LEVEL. SO -- WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH THEM -- CALLOW YES -- ANYTIME WE HAVE AN EVENT WE RELY HEAVILY ON THEIR FOR ME TOO LATE -- THEY ALSO PROVIDE US WITH THOSE TECHNICAL SPECIALIST TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT ARE WITHIN OUR COUNTY AND A RELATED TO THOSE DOES THAT ESTHER'S. SO -- YEAH I I JUST LIKE TO BEFORE I CLOSE OUT JUST SAY THAT I DO. THINK THAT THE SUPPORT FOR THE RECLAMATION DISTRICT IN THE FUNDING FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- AS YOU KNOW THE THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT LEVEES -- THAT ARE IMPACTED SO I CAN THE SECOND AREA AND THESE ARE ALL OLD LEVEES AND THEIR FRAGILE AND THE WHILE THE RECLAMATION DISTRICTS IN THE ONLY A IS -- DO A LOT OF WORK IN TRYING TO MAINTAIN THOSE THINGS IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF EFFORT A LOT OF RESOURCES TO DO THAT SO -- OBVIOUSLY IF THEY IF THEY MAINTAIN THEIR LEVEES AND THOSE LIKE IS A STRENGTH AND THEN THAT HELPS ME IN DOING MY JOB SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT -- AND I'M ALSO SUPPORT OF OF SOME OF pTHE FUNDING THAT THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT LIKE PROP -- EIGHTY FOUR ONE WHEN THE THOSE THINGS ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT -- TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE RESILIENCY AND THE PREPAREDNESS FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO WITH THAT I DON'T TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR QUESTIONS -- OUTSIDE OF A CATASTROPHIC. A RESPONSE PLAN HOW MANY OTHER TYPES OF CATASTROPHIC. PLANS DO WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE SO FAR WE'VE COMPLETED -- PLANS FOR THE THE HIGH HAZARD EARTHQUAKE AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BAY AREA AS WELL AS THE CASCADIA SUBDUCTION ZONE UP IN EXTREME NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION TO THE FLOOD PLAN. AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE ARE TO OTHER TYPES OF EVENTS OF COURSE THAT COULD BE CATASTROPHIC IN CALIFORNIA. I'M SORRY. YEAH RIGHT YES EARTHQUAKES YEAH AND THEN THE SAID NOR THE IT'S A CASCADIA UP IN -- DONOR HUMBLE AREA -- BUT THOSE THOSE GIVE US A A FRAMEWORK OF WHAT'S SOMETHING -- WE'RE REALLY KIND OF A MAXIMUM THE MAXIMUM TYPE OF EVENT SO IT ALLOWS US TO GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER TALK ABOUT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES SOME OF THE REALITIES OF THE TIMING ON RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BECOMING A FAR TO HELP US DEAL WITH SOMETHING. REALLY -- REALLY IMPACTFUL IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE EFFECT OF THOSE PLANS HAVE REALLY HELPED US WITH OTHER EVENTS AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE IN THAT ORVILLE -- DAM EMERGENCY WE ACTUALLY ACTIVATED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HAVE KIND OF A UNIFIED COMMAND AT THE AT THE YES LEVEL WITH THE FEDERAL WITH OUR FELLOW PARTNERS AND STATE AGENCIES THAT WE HAD CONTEMPLATED NEEDING FOR A CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKE AND SOME OF THE OTHER PLANS. AND THAT INTERNET THAT COMMANDED CONTROL ENDED UP BEING VERY USEFUL AND WE'RE ABLE TO TEST THAT CONCEPT OF HOW WE JOINTLY PRIORITIZE -- OF RESPONSE AND RESOURCES REQUEST WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS SO SO REALLY THE IDEA IS WE LOOK AT THESE -- MAXIMUM SCENARIOS BUT THE BENEFITS OF THOSE PLANS HELP US -- WITH EITHER DISASTERS THAT ARE LESS IMPACTFUL OR OTHER TYPES OF EVENTS THAT -- IT KIND OF KEEPS AS PRACTICED IN THAT THAT DIALOGUE OF HOW WE WOULD APPROACH. A BIG EMERGENCY. THANK YOU MY QUESTION WOULD BE -- AROUND THE ISSUE AND WE TALK A LOT ABOUT AGENCIES WORKING IN THEIR OWN. SILOS. YOU HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AS WELL IN FACT. IN OF ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WHAT IS YOU KNOW MAYBE THE LAST -- EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT YOU RESPONDED. WHAT WHAT IS THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE WHAT IS THAT COMMUNICATION I THINK THE PUBLIC -- SHOULD GET A BETTER SENSE OF THAT -- LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION THAT'S HAPPENING ON REAL TIME AND REALLY YOU KNOW TO THE POINT THAT YOUR SCENE THE RESPONSE ON THE GROUND. SO MAYBE YOU CAN CONSTRUCT AS TO WHAT THANK YOU FOR ABSOLUTE SO. I'M SORRY. TO OFFSET THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A LOCAL STANDARD SYSTEM FOR RESPONSE IT WAS A LESSON WE LEARNED ON BACK IN THE NINETIES AFTER THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY WAS TESTED IN. SOME OF THE EVENTS AND THAT REALLY -- ORGANIZES EMERGENCY SERVICES THE SAME WAY AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SO -- WHETHER IT'S LOCAL FIELD RESPONDERS ON THE SCENE AND THEM PORTENTS OF THAT IS BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S GOING TO NEED TO COME TOGETHER IN AN EVENT AND SO THEY NEED TO BE. APPROACHING THE MANAGEMENT OR MERCY IN A IN A SYSTEMATIC AND CONSISTENT WAY AND THEN EVERY LAYER THAT'S RESPONDING NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THOSE WHO ARE HELPING THEM -- SO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO TO KEEP TO STAND RIGHT AND THAT'S TESTED ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND AND IN ADVANCE IN FACT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED IT IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS -- SO THAT IS WHAT THAT SERVICE TWO THINGS PRIMARILY THAT IS AND HOW TO MOVE RESOURCES SO IF YOU NEED SOMETHING HAVE YOU ASKED FOR IT WHO DO YOU ASK. AND HOW DO WE GET IT BACK DOWN AND ALSO SERVES AS A WAY TO PROVIDE SUITABLE BECAUSE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS SO HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT UP TO THE NEXT TO THE COUNTY UP TO THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE STATE OR HAVE A VANTAGE POINT OF MAYBE MULTIPLE COUNTIES AFFECTED. IN SO HOWEVER WE SORT OF TAKING THAT ALL IN AND BEING A FISSION AND HOW WE PROVIDE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES BACK OUT. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE ASK WHETHER IT'S STATE -- YES SIR AND COUNTY -- YES HAS TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH DIFFERENT ENTITIES WITH DIFFERENT SUB EXPERTISE THAT MIGHT LEND A HAND IN THAT EVENT THAT CANNOT COME TOGETHER. IN YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING IS HAPPEN YOU HAVE TO CULTIVATE THAT AHEAD OF TIME FOR EXAMPLE OF AT THE STATE LEVEL WE RELY ON ALL THE STATE AGENCIES -- TO HAVE SOME ROLE IN EITHER GETTING READY FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDING TO IT -- OVERSEAS DON'T TYPICALLY PRESENT THEMSELVES WITH SORT OF ONE TYPE OF FACT AND WILL DO TO BE YOU ARE IN A FLOOD EVENT WOULD BE PRIMARY -- FOR FLOOD FIGHT UNDERSTAND THE WATER SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOCIAL IMPACTS -- PEOPLE THAT NEED SHELTER WE'RE GONNA HAVE HEALTH IMPACTS AND SO IT'S UP TO US TO IN LIST AND THE EXPERTISE OF OUR STATE AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE THOSE THINGS TRANSPORTATION -- SECURITY WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BE ABLE TO DRAW THAT IN. AND SO THE WAY THAT WE MAINTAIN THAT IS FIRST OF ALL WE'VE DEFINED ROLES OF STATE AGENCIES IN OUR STATE EMERGENCY PLAN SO WE KNOW WHO IS CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT AND HOW THAT MIGHT GET EMPLOYED IN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISASTERS WE COULD HAVE -- AND THEN WE HAVE TO PRACTICE THAT WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THINGS CHANGE YOU KNOW HOW HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT AREABLE TO EMPLOY THAT IN THE FUTURE. AS WELL AND THEN -- FINALLY AN ACTUAL EVENTS THEY COME AND THEY SAID IN OUR OFFICE AND WE HAVE A AS STATE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER IT'S GOT A SEAT FOR ALL THAT. NOT TO STATE PARTNERS BUT THE BUT THE FEDERAL PARTNERS AS WELL SO THE WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW ASYMMETRIC EFFECTS AND KIND OF REQUIRE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS. AND THE SAME TIME WE'RE CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO SIMILAR HASN'T UC -- IT TO KIND OF LET US KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND WITH THE SITUATION HOUSE A CHANGING WHAT DO YOU NEED SO WE'RE KEEPING THAT REAL TIME. COMMUNICATION WITH -- WITH OUR COUNTIES AND BY EXTENSION THE COMMUNITIES THAT AND KEEPING THE COMMUNICATION UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO COME HELP US AND THEN ACROSS TO THE STATE EMERGENCY SO. IT DOESN'T JUST COME TOGETHER IN IN A DISASTER WHEN WE ACTIVATE THE EOC THAT HAS TO BE RELATIONSHIPS WE ESTABLISH AHEAD OF TIME SO THEY'RE READY. FOR THAT RESPONSE SO THAT WE CAN BE EFFECTIVE. IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I I'D LIKE TO REITERATE WHAT YOU JUST SAID IT IN THAT -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE DO THE VERY SAME THING -- FROM OUR OUR PARTNERS THAT ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE THE RECLAMATION DISTRICT THE CITY'S -- AS WELL CITY AND THE STATE AND THE FEDS -- SO WE'RE COSTLY WORK WITH INVOLVING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WHEN SOMEBODY FROM OUR OFFICE GOES IN TO MEET WITH THEM WE TYPICALLY KNOW EACH OTHER THE SAME VICE VERSA THE SAME THING THEY COME IN. TO OUR OFFICE WE TYPICALLY KNOW WHO'S COMING IN AND WE HAVE A SEAT AT OUR TABLE ARE YOU'LL SEE -- FOR A LOT OF PARTNERS -- FROM -- PROBABLY AROUND IT'S A SMALLER -- EOC OBVIOUSLY BUT WE PROBABLY HAVE ROOM FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE TO COME INTO OURS OF WHICH PROBABLY AT LEAST THIRTY OF THEM ARE -- LIAISONS FROM OTHER AGENCIES.
