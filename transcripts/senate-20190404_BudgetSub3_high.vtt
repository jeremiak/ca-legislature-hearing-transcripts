00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.218
ISSUE WITH OUR L. P. A.'S THAT'S

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:00.586
A BIG CHALLENGE FOR US IT'S A

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:03.356
IT'S JUST A CONSTANT -- CHURNING

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:05.324
OF STAFF THE JOBS VERY DEMANDING

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.225
THEIR CASE LOW THEY'RE

FACILITIES TO BE SEVEN DAYS A

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.998
WEEK -- TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.499
THERE'S PROBLEMS THEY'RE THERE --

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.034
AND SO SOME STAFF JUST CAN'T

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.869
HANDLE IT THEIR THEIR LOW PAYING

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.638
JOBS THERE BELOW THE A. T. P.

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.173
A.'S THAT IS THAT THAT STANDARD

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.841
ANALYST POSITION IN THE STATE

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:24.544
THEIR TOP SALARY IS THE LOWEST.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.545
OF THE EIGHT GPA SO THERE'S YOU

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.280
KNOW WHEN IT'S VERY CHALLENGING

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:33.686
TO KEEP THEM -- ON STAFF -- THEN

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.154
WE'VE BEEN -- WE HAVE THE

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:35.822
COMPLAINT BACKLOG THAT SOMETHING

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.023
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:37.890
THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN GOING

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.258
UP BUT WE'VE BEEN KEEPING UP

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.827
WITH THE INCREASE OF COMPLAINTS

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.094
OVER NINETY DAYS.

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.697
BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAD

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:49.468
ABOUT. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.403
THE BACKLOG WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:52.538
CLOSE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED OVER

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:53.773
NINETY DAYS SO WE'RE WE'RE

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.474
CHUNKING AWAY AT THE BACKLOG AS

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.277
WE CAN YOU KNOW BASED ON THE

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.613
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.748
AND LASTLY WE HAVE AN OUTDATED

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.350
LEGACY SYSTEM THAT IS A

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.118
CHALLENGE FOR US YOU KNOW

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.086
SOMETIMES THAT THE L. PA'S WILL

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.822
BE OUT ON INSPECTION AND THE

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.057
COMPUTER WILL JUST GO INTO A

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.658
CONSISTENCY CHECK FOR LIKE AN

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.727
HOUR TO TWO HOURS BEFORE THEY

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.863
CAN CONTINUE WITH THEIR

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.197
COMPLETING THEIR REPORTS.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:21.601
SO WE RELY ON LOTUS NOTES AND

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.902
WE'RE WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.070
CAN NINE HOURS OF THE BEST WE

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.339
CAN TO KEEP IT TOGETHER SO --

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.141
THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE SOME

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.744
OF THE CHALLENGES.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.212
OKAY WHAT DO I JUST CONTINUE ON

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.282
WITH THE THE OTHER TWO QUESTIONS

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.217
AS WELL OKAY SO -- AND AN

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.652
OVERVIEW OF THE INSPECTION

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.255
PROCESS -- I DO HAVE A MORE

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:43.789
COMPLETE POWER POINT THAT I AM.

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.291
THAT YOU CAN BE PRESENTED THAT

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.626
HAS MORE OF THE DETAIL TO IT

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:47.960
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.428
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE DID

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.898
A PILOT FOR THE SENIOR CARE WE

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.499
DID TWO HUNDRED INSPECTIONS --

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.167
AND SO NOW WE'RE GOING OVER THE

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.402
ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW WE'VE HIRED

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:58.504
SACKS STATE TO ASSIST US WITH

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:02.308
SOME ABOUT ANALYSIS -- AND THE

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.743
THE THE TOOLS ARE BUILT ON

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:06.712
DOMAIN SO IT'S WE NEVER HAD A

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.014
COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.116
PACKET BEFORE A TOOL FOR THE L.

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.517
P. A.'S USE SO THEY ALL USED

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.719
THEIR OWN NAMES THEY MADE THEIR

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.521
OWN UP SO NOW WE HAVE A STANDARD.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:17.323
ANNEKE IT HAS BUILT ON DOMAINS

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.725
LIKE RESIDENT RIGHTS MEDICATIONS

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:22.395
THEM BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS AND

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:24.263
SO IT'S MORE OF A YOU CAN GET A

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.698
WHOLE PULSE OF THE FACILITY

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.533
WHETHER IT'S IN THEIR INCOME

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.568
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE SO --

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.771
THAT WE GOT A LOT OF DATA OUT OF

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.205
THE THE COMPREHENSIVE TOOL SO

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:34.740
WITH THAT TOOL WE'RE TAKING THAT

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.642
THAT THE DATA AND WE'RE BUILDING

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:41.781
THE STANDARD TO WHICH IS GOING

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:43.382
TO REPLACE THE CAT -- AND SO

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:44.717
I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN MY THIRD

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.218
QUESTION SO WERE -- ALL THREE

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.586
PROGRAMS THE CHILD CARE IN

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:48.220
CHILDREN'S ROSE HAVE DEVELOPED

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:48.888
THEIR TOOLS AND SO WE'RE GETTING

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.156
PREPARED TO DO THEIR PILOTS

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.590
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING PILOTS FOR

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.125
MOST OF THE FACILITY TYPES

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.660
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SPECIFIC.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:58.898
TOOLS FOR EACH FACILITY TYPE.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.700
AND SO YOU'RE ASKING HOW THE

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.134
INSPECTION PROCESS WILL BE

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:06.739
MEASURED -- WILL MEASURE IT BY --

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.607
THE CLOSURES AND THIS IS GONNA

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:10.543
BE A NEW BASELINE FOR US BECAUSE

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.678
WE HAVEN'T HAD WE WEREN'T ABLE

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.313
TO COLLECT DATA WITH THE KIT AND

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.047
SO.

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.615
WITH THESE NEW TOOLS WE'RE GONNA

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.617
BE ABLE TO COLLECT OUR BASELINE

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:20.720
DATA AND THE MEASURE BY CLOSURES

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.521
BY COMPLIANCE ISSUES BY NUMBER

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:23.823
OF CITATIONS.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:26.192
THE TOOL ALSO HAS BUILT IN

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.994
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.462
DIDN'T HAVE AND THE OTHER TOOL

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:31.964
AND IT'S MORE OF AN INTER OF

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.866
PROCESS SO THE KID DIDN'T ALLOW

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.534
YOU TO UPDATE IT AS YOU GOT NEW

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.369
LAWS.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.204
ENACTED SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.472
TAKE A EXTRA PIECE OF PAPER

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:40.573
WRITE IT DOWN AND SAY I NEED TO

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.708
CHECK FOR LIABILITY INSURANCE OR

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:43.175
WHATEVER.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.944
THIS IS THE INTERIM PROCESS WILL

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:45.811
BE CONTINUOUS QUALITY

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.380
IMPROVEMENT WE UPDATED AS NEW

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:49.749
LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE IN PLACE

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.650
SO WE WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:53.252
THIS IS GOING TO HELP BUT THE

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.820
PREVENTION SIDE OF ITS VERY

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:56.455
TRANSPARENT WE HAVE IT ON OUR

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.490
WEBSITE SO.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.191
PROVIDERS CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:00.526
THE WHOLE TOOL AND SAY THESE ARE

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:01.761
ALL THE REGULATIONS WE NEED TO

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.396
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND ACTUALLY

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:05.998
USE THAT AS A TRAINING

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.801
INSTRUMENT.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.002
YOU MAY GO TO THE THIRD OKAY THE

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:11.570
THIRD QUESTION OF A BRIEF

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:13.105
HISTORY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:13.839
KIT.

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.674
TOOL AND DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:17.076
NEW TOOLS WILL BE VALIDATED.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.377
SO THE KIDS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.646
BASED ON SOUND RESEARCH IN THE

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.381
FIELD OF CHILD CARE THEY WERE

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.215
REALLY.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.151
UTILIZE DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:26.986
CUTS OF RESOURCES DURING THE

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.255
RECESSION AND SO -- IF THEY

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:30.923
WEREN'T A GOOD INDICATOR OF A

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.658
HEALTHY FACILITY AND THAT'S ONE

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:33.726
THING THAT I FOUND ONE AFTER I

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.494
TOOK THIS JOB FIVE YEARS AGO

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:36.262
THAT WHY ARE WE DOING

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:37.963
INSPECTIONS THE YEAR TWO YET

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.131
LATER WERE FINDING THESE

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.800
COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT WE DIDN'T

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.001
IDENTIFY.

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:43.969
SO -- SO THAT'S WHERE WE START

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.237
TALKING ABOUT THE NEW TOOL OR

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:46.539
YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT A WHOLE

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.340
COMPENDIUM OF THE REGULATIONS AT

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:49.775
EVERY PART OF IT NOT JUST A FEW

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:54.980
PIECES LIKE WE HAD ON THE CAT --

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:58.384
SO -- HOW WE'RE GONNA VALIDATED

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.387
AGAIN IS IS BASICALLY -- THE

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:03.189
POST INSPECTION LICENSING

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:04.557
SERVICE WHEN WE DID THAT THE

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:05.925
PILOTS WE ACTUALLY LEAVE A

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:07.793
SURVEY FOR THE LICENSEE AND THE

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.061
LPA TO FILL OUT WE'VE GOT

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.063
FEEDBACK FROM THEM WE HAD FOCUS

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.365
GROUPS AFTERWARDS -- THE INTER

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:15.701
RATER RELIABILITY WE HAD --

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.636
MANAGERS THAT WENT ON SITE TO DO

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.772
IN A RATER RELIABILITY WE ROUTE

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.609
74% SO 70% AS THIS IS THE MEDIAN

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:25.111
AVERAGE THEY TELL US YOU NEED TO

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.812
GET ABOVE THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.380
AT HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT A LITTLE

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:30.850
BIT HIGHER -- SO THESE ARE ALL

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.585
THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.153
ACTUALLY MEASURE IF IT THIS IS

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.389
DOING A GOOD JOB AT AND ALSO

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:39.191
LOOKING AT OTHER STATES

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:39.492
[inaudible]

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.360

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.806
TO JUST -- TOUCH BASE A LITTLE

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:58.911

THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.287
KNOW JERRY TROUBLE RETAINING

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:11.157
CERTAIN POSITIONS BECAUSE THE

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:12.892
PAY IS LOW.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.528
SO CAN YOU WRITE TO WELL WE HAVE --

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:18.697

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:27.173
CAN BE.

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.440
DANGEROUS SITUATION WE'VE HAD TO

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:29.808
CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SO THAT

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:30.910
THEY HAVE THE TOOLS HOW TO DE

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.012
ESCALATE WHAT TO DO IN THESE

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:34.280
TYPE OF SITUATIONS WE HAVE A

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:36.282
BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:38.484
LICENSEES SO WE'RE TRYING TO

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:40.586

TO ABOUT.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.503
HUNDRED POSITIONS AND HOW THAT

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.638
COMPARES WELL AS A HISTORICALLY

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:01.840
I GUESS BEFORE THE RECESSION IS

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.876

OKAY AND AND YOU'RE ABLE.

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:10.449
TO THAT DATE PERCENT VACANCY

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:16.755
RATE STILL HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:19.024
WHOM WELL.

SAY YES IT'S FINE.

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:26.966
I WILL DO ON THE SIDE.

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:27.633
MOST OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.534
WITH CURRENT STAFF THAT WE

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.602
ALREADY HAD THAT -- IS ACTUALLY

00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:30.502

DISCUSSED ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:49.421
OF CCL I THINK ESPECIALLY -- AS

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:50.923
PA AS LAWS CHANGING POLICIES

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.625
CHANGE THAT REQUIRE MORE

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.760
FREQUENT INSPECTIONS -- THIS

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.228
ISSUE OF A FOR READY HAVING AN

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.896
ISSUE WITH RETENTION AND VACANCY

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.266
HOW THEN DO YOU BUILD UPON THAT.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.568
TO INCREASED FREQUENCY AN

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.370
INSPECTION. FOR YEARS SO YOU

00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:09.808
LOOK AT THIS TOO RIGHT AND SO.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:10.442

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.377
DO YOU HAVE CAN STEER DO YOU

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:12.444
HAVE CONCERNS BASED ON THE

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:13.579
NUMBERS YOU LOOK THAT RELATE TO

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:15.514
THIS AGENCY.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.017
I'M NOT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.918
OVERVIEW BUT IN GENERAL THERE

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.955
HAVE BEEN ISSUES RAISED ABOUT --

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:25.090
FOR NUMBER FACILITIES TO THE

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.659
EXTENT THAT THERE FOR

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.661
INSPECTIONS -- FOR FOR FREQUENCY

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.229
OF INSPECTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:32.665
RAMP UP WHICH SOME ARE -- IN THE

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:33.966
CURRENT YEAR BUT ALSO IN FUTURE

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:37.069
YEARS THE QUESTION OF ARE WE

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:38.737
THAT ARE DO WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFF

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.406
TO SUPPORT THAT RAMP UP THOSE

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.607
ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.108
MONITORING AND TRACKING.

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:44.243
OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT THAT

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.412
CERTAINLY IMPORTANT SO YOU KNOW

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.147
NUMBER POSITIONS HOW MANY

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:49.415
VACANCIES BECAUSE IT'S HOW MANY

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:50.816
PEOPLE DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.151
WOULD DO THE WORK OKAY.

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.520
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE KEEP

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:55.688
YES IT WAS A MISTER CHAIR

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.022
MEMBERS PAT KELLY REACTING

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.324
DIRECTOR -- THE ONE THING I JUST

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.159
WANT TO STRESS IS THAT HIRING

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.628
AND RETENTION OF STAFF IS A VERY

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:04.863
HIGH PRIORITY IN CCL SO AS

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:05.931
MISTER PROSS WAS OUTLINING SORT

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.466
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT GO ALONG

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.868
WITH THAT -- IT IS A VERY LARGE

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:11.670
POPULATION AND WE THERE IS

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.439
ONGOING WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:14.907
THAT FOLKS ARE HAVING TO STEP IN

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:16.942
AND DO SO TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.677
THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:21.613
INNOVATIVE AND AND DIFFERENTLY.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.282
WE POSSIBLY CAN TO HIRE AS MANY

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.250
QUALIFIED STAFF AS WE POSSIBLY

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.919
CAN AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN IT'S

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.053
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GETTING

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.456
BETTER AND BETTER OUT -- WE THIS

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:32.458
THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN -- AND

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:33.792
AN ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN BOTH

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.694
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ADDING

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:37.396
RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY CARE

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:38.797
LICENSING OVER THE LAST FIVE

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.265
YEARS WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.000
INFLUX TO REALLY TRY AND CHANGE

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:43.102
THE DIVISION.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.503
CHANGE THE CULTURE THAT'S

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.472
REFLECTED IN MANY OF THE

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:48.440
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT YOU HEARD --

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.909
BUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DAY --

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.177
HIGH PRIORITY TO ENSURE THAT

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:54.146
WE'RE HIRING EVERY SINGLE

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:56.382
AUTHORIZED POSITION THAT WE HAVE

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.583
OKAY WISEMAN BE SURE WE'RE

00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:00.152
KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT --

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:02.054
BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN THIS THEM

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:03.155
FOR IMPORT ROLE AND I KNOW THAT.

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:09.661
PASSED HEARINGS YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:11.830
TALKED ABOUT.

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:12.765
RELATIONS SOME OF THEM FRANKLY

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.266
TO TRY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.402
YOU KNOW -- TO DECREASE THE SUR

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:18.904
WORKLOAD RIGHT -- AND DOWN TO

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:19.705
EXAMPLES OF AND THAT IN ITSELF

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:20.472
IS IN THIS REALLY BAD BUT I

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.340
THINK IT'S RAISE SOME CONCERN

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.608
WHETHER.

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.343
SOME OF THE STEPS WERE TAKING NO

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.511
MIGHT CAUSE MORE THINGS TO GET

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:28.046
MISTER SOMETHING SO -- FOR

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:31.784
EXAMPLE IN ONE WORD AND THE UNIT.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.718
BUT TO APPRECIATE SIMPLY LOOK AT

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:33.852
THE MAINS AND THEN YOU MIGHT

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.287
LOOK AT ONE MEASURE TO REFLECT

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.221
THAT DOMAIN.

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:38.257
AND BUY THINGS YOU ALWAYS HAVE

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.192
TO KEEP AN EYE ON IS OUR PEOPLE

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:40.993
THIS WAS A PEOPLE ARE VERY SMART

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.060
INTO THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE TEST

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.662
QUESTIONS ARE YOU YOU PREPARE

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.063
FOR THE TEST.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.799
BUT THAT DOESN'T AND WHILE WE

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:47.933
TRY TO DESIGN A TEST SO THAT

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.034
THIS WAS QUESTIONS REFLECT THE

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.569
LARGER THING RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:51.703
NOT TO ASK FOR IT WE ASK

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.238
QUESTIONS ON EVERY SINGLE THING

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:55.207
YOU WOULD BE A REALLY REALLY.

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:57.176
BIG LONG EXPENSIVE TEST CENTER

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:57.743
WILL BE SURE PEOPLE AREN'T

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.411
GAMING THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:00.612
THE MARKER ACTUALLY DOES A

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:02.815
MARKER STILL TRULY REFLECT OVER

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.118
TIME -- THE ACTUAL FULL THE MAIN --

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.953
NOTS AND WRITING THAT JUST

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.088
CONTINUALLY MONITOR AYE A TWO

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.457
SURE THAT THAT'S AND THAT WE'RE

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:12.658
NOT CREATING SORT OF PERVERSE

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:14.226
INCENTIVES TO DO CERTAIN THINGS

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:14.893
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.128
MEASURING OTHER THINGS THAT WE

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:23.936
DON'T MEASURE.

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:25.337
WE ALSO TO KEEP AN EYE ON RIGHT.

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:26.371
YES AND THAT'S WHY THIS TOOL IS

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:27.873
IS SO DIFFERENT THAN THE KIT

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.807
BECAUSE THERE'S THINGS WE DIDN'T

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:29.842
MEASURE SO WE WILL OUR QUALITY

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.543
ASSURANCE TEAM IS LOOKING VERY

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.711
CLOSELY AT AT THE THE DATUM THE

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.813
CITATIONS RIGHT AND THAT'S

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.881
THAT'S WHY.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:36.915
SO I APPRECIATE THE UPDATE AS WE

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:37.649
HAD THIS QUESTION SPECIFICALLY

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:38.250
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:39.785
KNOW HOW THAT WAS GOING AND

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:40.419
WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THAT SO.

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.054
I MEAN WE WANT TO STRIKE THE

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.921
RIGHT BALANCE IN TERMS OF BURDEN

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:43.655
ON THE PEOPLE BE INSPECTED SO

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:44.590

THE INFORMATION WE NEED.

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:47.826
FOR PROTECTION SAFETY RIGHT YEAH

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:51.563
OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.832
OKAY ANY OTHER.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.301
MOVE ON TO A DATA MIGRATION

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:57.202
ISSUE NUMBER TWO THE C. P. FOR

DATA MIGRATION FOR LEGACY

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.073
SYSTEMS. FOR AGAIN CALORIE WITH

00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:03.542
DEPARTMENT -- ONE OF THE MOST

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.177
EFFECTIVE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.879
TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND TO

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:08.313
MAKE SURE THAT OUR STAFF HAVE

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.415
THE TIME TO DO THE JOB THAT WERE

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:11.617
TASKING THEM WITH.

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:12.518
IS FOR IMPROVE THE TOOLS THAT

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:14.152
THEY HAVE TO USE IN THE FIELD

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.821
AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:18.657
ARE SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE USING.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:23.295
OUR WERE INVENTED DURING PAGER --

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:25.898
TIMES -- AND THEY ARE NOT WHAT

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:27.766
ANYBODY AT THE TIME THEY WERE

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.601
CUTTING EDGE THEY TRULY WERE WE

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.103
USED TO HAVE L. P. A.'S WHO

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:32.538
LITERALLY CARRIED IN THE TRUNK

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:34.907
OF THEIR CAR BOXES FULL OF FORMS

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:36.008
AND MANUALS.

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:37.543
THAT THEY HAD TO BRING TO EVERY

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.811
SINGLE CHILD CARE IN THE STATE

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:40.379
SO THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:42.381
FORMS TO DO IT WE TOOK ALL THAT

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:44.049
PAPER AND MADE IT A COMPUTER

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:44.883
SYSTEM.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:45.918
WHICH IS HOW YOU USED TO DO

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.686
THINGS FACT THAT IT IS NOT HOW

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:49.087
WE WOULD BUILD A COMPUTER SYSTEM

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:51.490
TODAY BUT WE STILL ARE TASKED

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:52.891
WITH USING THIS LEGACY SYSTEMS

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:53.992
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.661
REPLACE SOME OVER THE YEARS.

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.930
SO WE HAVE BEGUN EFFORTS TO

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.898
REPLACE ALL OF THOSE SYSTEMS --

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.400
PART OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:04.202
CARES PROJECT INVOLVES -- THE

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:06.138
LICENSING PORTION FOR CHILDREN'S

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:08.807
RESIDENTIAL -- WE HAVE PLANNED

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.342
AS THAT PROJECT HAS MOVED

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.578
FORWARD THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:15.013
CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL LICENSING.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.615
AND ALL OF OUR OTHER LICENSING

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.951
PROGRAMS ARE DE MINIMUS -- SO

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:20.919
WE'VE PLANNED EVENTUALLY TO USE

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.821
THAT WHAT'S DEVELOPED IN THAT

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.123
SYSTEM -- TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.991
FOR OTHER SYSTEMS BUT WE'RE

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.492
STILL MANY YEARS AWAY FROM DOING

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:28.694
THAT BECAUSE CHILDREN

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.129
RESIDENTIAL IS A CENTRAL PART OF

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:32.764
IT THESE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE IT --

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.100
AND SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:38.270
WAYS WE CAN IN THE INTERIM

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:39.304
CREATE A STOPGAP SO THAT AND

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:40.672
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ONE ARE

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.842
LPA GOES OUT TO A FACILITY TO DO --

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.111
AN INSPECTION OR COMPLAINT VISIT.

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:49.114
FREQUENTLY OUR SYSTEMS -- WILL

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.550
GLITCH AND YOU WILL GET A COT

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:52.784
WHAT'S KNOWN AS A CONTINUITY

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.586
CHECK WERE I I CALL IT THE

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:55.721
LITTLE BLUE SPINNING WHEEL OF

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.090
DEATH -- THAT HAPPENS THAT MIGHT

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:03.662
OCCUR AS LONG AS AN HOUR.

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:04.296
SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE TO SIT THERE

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:06.598
AND NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER THINGS

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:07.332
ON THE COMPUTER FOR SONGS THAT

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:07.933
THAT'S AN HOUR THAT THEY ARE.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.800
DOING OTHER THINGS.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:09.668
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MOVING

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:10.502
FORWARD WITH TRYINGTO FIND AN

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:13.338
INTERIM SOLUTION -- TO GET OUR

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.207
STAFF ON ALL MODERN PLATFORM

00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:16.675
WITH MODERN TOOLS SO THAT THEY

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.310
CAN DO THINGS IN AN EFFICIENT

00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:18.877
WAY.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.178
IN AN INTUITIVE WAY AND HAVE

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.380
EVERYTHING AT THEIR FINGERTIPS

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.681
THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY GO TO

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:24.816
AN INSPECTION -- INCLUDING THE

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:27.786
DIRECTIONS YOU KNOW BEING ABLE

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:28.687
TO GET THE RUSSIANS THE FACILITY.

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:30.856
PART OF ANY NEW SYSTEM OR

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:32.824
SYSTEMS WHATEVER PLATFORM YOU

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:34.860
USE IS ALWAYS HOW DO YOU DEAL

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:36.228
WITH THE DATA MIGRATION HOW DO

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:37.729
YOU DEAL WITH ALL THAT ALL DATA.

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.365
LICENSING NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:42.701
TO THE PRIOR HISTORY OF SILLY

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:43.402
NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:45.737
BEFORE SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:46.872
THAT WHAT THEY DO.

00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:47.973
BECAUSE ALL OF THE DATA THAT'S

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.141
IN THERE WAS CREATED OVER THE

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:51.576
LAST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.311
IS AND IT WASN'T CREATED THE WAY

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:54.913
THAT WE WOULD DO A MODERN --

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.082
TECHNOLOGY IT'S IT NEEDS TO BE

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:00.585
MIGRATED TO A MODERN PLATFORM --

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.120
SHE MENTIONED LOTUS NOTES WE

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:03.622
ALSO USE EIGHT A BASS AND

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:05.457
NATURAL WHICH ARE COMPUTER

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:07.859
LANGUAGES NO ONE SPEAKS ANYMORE

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.628
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIND

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:11.563
STAFF TO WORK ON THESE SYSTEMS.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.099
SO WHAT ARE THIS PROPOSAL IS IS

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.001
TO TAKE THAT DATA THAT'S

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:17.402
CURRENTLY THERE.

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:20.972
AND MIGRATED TO A MODERN --

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.407
ARCHITECTURE.

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:23.975
IT IS AHEAD OF WHERE YOU

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.577
NORMALLY SEE THAT AND IN A

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:27.646
PROJECT USUALLY SAY WELL HERE'S

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:30.048
WHAT WE WANT TO BUILD A FOUR BY.

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:32.451
FOUR LICENSE OR IN A BY LICENSES

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.985
FOR AND DATA MIGRATION IS A PART

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.387
OF THAT.

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:37.489
BECAUSE WE ARE STILL IN THE

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:39.558
PROJECT APPROVAL -- SCALE FOR

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:41.026
GOING FOR ONE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:42.494
GOING TO DO FOR THAT WE KNOW

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.762
THAT DATA MIGRATION IS AN

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:45.330
ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT.

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:47.032
AND WE KNOW THAT BY PUTTING IT

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.433
AT THE TAIL END SO TO THE

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.936
CABOOSE ON ON THE PROJECT.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:52.070
YOU ARE WITHOUT MUCH LONGER

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:53.572
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE WORKING

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:55.474
SOFTWARE IN THE HANDS OF THE

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.675
STAFF WHO NEED IT.

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:58.276
BY BRINGING THE DATA MIGRATION

00:22:58.343 --> 00:23:02.447
FORWARD AND PUTTING IT IN IT IN-A IT'S IT'S A SYSTEM AGNOSTIC

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:04.416
WAY IT'S JUST PUTTING IT INTO A

00:23:04.483 --> 00:23:06.118
MODERN ARCHITECTURE WE CAN

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:08.453
ACTUALLY FIND STAFF WHO CAN WORK

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.254
ON IT.

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:11.623
WHATEVER SYSTEM WE BUILD WILL BE

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.259
ABLE TO ACCESS THAT DATA AS

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:15.827
QUICKLY AS WE CAN GET A SYSTEM

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.529
CONFIGURED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:19.397
WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AN EXTRA

00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:20.999
THREE YEARS AT THE TAIL AND TO

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.701
DO THAT.

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:23.902
SO THAT'S THE PROPOSAL BEFORE IT

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:27.706
OKAY ALL RIGHT COMING FAMILIA.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:29.074
CONCEPTUALLY INTERSTATE AND THE

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.976
VALUE THAT THIS ACTIVITY WOULD

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:32.878
HAVE ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.346
OF JUST OPERATING.

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:37.215
CURRENT PROGRAM -- PRACTICES

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:38.283
JUST SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.684
A FLAG FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.520
CONSIDERATION AS WAS MENTIONED

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:43.021
THIS ACTIVITIES A PART OF A

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.323
BROADER BIGGER PICTURE I. T.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.527
PROJECT -- SO JUST ENSURING THAT

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:49.961
IF THIS B. C. P. R. PROPOSAL

00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:52.097
GOES FORWARD THAT THE DATA

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:53.431
MIGRATION OR THE DATA CLEANUP

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:55.300
ACTIVITY IS PULLED FROM THOSE

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:57.235
PROJECT PROPOSALS AND COST

00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:59.070
ESTIMATES -- TO REFLECT THAT

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:00.505
THIS IS HAPPENING AND THEN

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:01.840
ANOTHER THING THAT WE WOULD FLAG

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.375
IS GIVEN THAT THE PROPOSAL'S

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:06.178
BASED OFF OF ESTIMATED COST --

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:07.879
AND WOULD BE SPENT ACROSS THREE

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:10.048
YEARS RATHER THAN PROVIDING THE

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.049
FULL AMOUNT OF FINDING AN

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.617
ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE FOR THE

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:15.320
LEGISLATURE -- TO PROVIDE FIRST

00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:18.890
YEAR FUNDING AND THEN WHEN COST --

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.659
WE GET A BETTER SENSE OF COST.

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.527
OF ACTUAL COST -- HAVING THE

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.262
ADMINISTRATION COME BACK AND

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:27.833
REQUEST THE REMAINING AMOUNT --

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:28.867
THAT'S NEEDED [inaudible]

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:32.137
IT'S DOESN'T REDUCE FRONT OF AN

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:33.371
ANSWER -- AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:34.439
OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL

00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:36.408
THEN AS ACTING DIRECTOR LARRY

00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:37.742
STATED THAT THERE'S AN AGING

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:39.177
INFRASTRUCTURE HERE THAT'S GONNA

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:41.146
INVENTION WE NEED TO BE UPDATED --

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.681
THE PROPOSAL IS IN LINE WITH THE

00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:44.883
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES -- PAL

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.786
PROCESS AND ADDITIONALLY LAST

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:49.955
YEAR FINANCE INSTITUTED BUDGET

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:52.524
LETTER -- EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE

00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:53.792
THE REQUIRES THAT ANY PROJECT

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:56.027
THE RECIEVES FUNDING -- ANY AYE

00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:57.662
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT

AN ANNUAL -- PLANNING

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:02.634
EXPENDITURE REPORT SO WE FEEL

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.269
THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE --

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.538
OVERSIGHT -- TO TO MAINTAIN AND

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:07.973
AND AND FOLLOW WHAT THE PROJECT

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.774
IS DOING SO AGAIN WE ENCOURAGE

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.910
AND SUPPORT THE THE PROPOSAL AS

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:17.115
IT IS FOR THE FUNDING OR THREE

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.416
YEARS.

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:19.885
THE QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:20.886
ALRIGHT SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO

00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:21.553
BASICALLY I MEAN THIS IS A THREE

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.988
YEAR PROJECT SO IT IS A FIXED

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:23.521
PERIOD OF TIME [inaudible]

00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:25.523
CORRECT.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.192
THE THE WAY THAT THE COST ARE

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:28.927
LAID OUT IN THE B. C. E. AND THE

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:31.129
COST WOULD BE EXPENDED OVER

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:32.230
THREE YEARS RIGHT.

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:34.266
BOB.

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:36.334
IT WILL TAKE TIME TO ACTUALLY DO

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:37.068
THE DATA MIGRATION TO GET TE

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:39.771
CONTRACT EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:41.106
SO OKAY SO I I'M JUST SAYING NO

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:42.307
SO I MEAN FOR SO LIKE I HEAR

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.475
YOUR CONCERN ABOUT FIRST OF ALL.

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:44.042
VIEWS AS PART OF A LARGER

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:45.810
PROJECT WERE SERVED BUDGING FOR

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.245
THE SEPARATELY AND WE DON'T GET

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:48.713
DOUBLE COUNTED RIGHT SO BECAUSE

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.115
WE'RE PAYING FOR NOW ON ITS OWN

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:51.783
IS THAT WE NEED TO AND THEN WE

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.484
THAT SOMEONE FALLS INTO COSTS

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.019
AND OTHER THINGS AND THEN THE

00:25:54.085 --> 00:25:54.719
OTHER PART.

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:56.288
THAT IT NEARLY YOU SAID IT'S A

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:57.389
LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:58.023
STARTING IT'S A LITTLE BIT AN

00:25:58.089 --> 00:26:00.258
ESTIMATE WE DON'T KNOW BUT I

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:01.726
MEAN IT'S ALSO IT'S NOT AND IT

00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:02.994
CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.362
THAT OR ANYTHING SO IT IS IS A

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.264
THREE YEAR WE COULD NEXT YEAR

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:08.066
EVEN THOUGH WE APPROPRIATED

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:09.301
THREE YEARS SAY A HOW MUCH HAVE

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.369
YOU SPENT SO FAR WHERE ARE YOU

00:26:11.436 --> 00:26:12.170
RIGHT SO.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:13.405
AND THAT'S ONE ALTERNATIVE AS

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:14.806
WELL IF YOU GO FORWARD WITH AS

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.041
IT'S PROPOSED PROVIDE THE FULL

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:17.409
AMOUNT OF FUNDING BASED OFF A%

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:18.944
COST ESTIMATE IS JUST ENSURING

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:17.148
IMPORTANT PIECE TO KEEP IN MIND --

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.382

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:15.773
COUNTIES GOT ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.707
FROM HI THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:17.675
THIS PARTNERSHIP SO THING A LOT

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:18.576
OF SUCCESS WE DON'T HAVE

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.177
EVALUATION RESULTS YET -- BUT

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:21.312
THE PROGRAM IS SET TO SUNSET

00:41:21.378 --> 00:41:23.447
THIS THE FISCAL YEAR.

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:24.949
THE NEXT ITEM IS THE FAMILIES

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:26.483
FIRST ACT IN THE QUESTIONS WERE.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.185
AROUND -- BASICALLY KIND WHAT IS

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.954
IT AND WHAT IMPACTS MIGHT THAT

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:30.387
MIGHT WE SEE.

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:31.589
I THINK.

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:34.358
THAT THE THE FEDERALIZED IS VERY

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:35.826
VERY COMPLICATED HAS MANY CAUGHT

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.661
MANY PARTS AND MANY STARTIN

00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:39.697
START OUR START DATES AND SO FOR

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:40.431
THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:42.066
I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:44.635
ON A COUPLE OF AREAS PART.

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.237
ONE OFTEN SEEN AS THE PREVENTION

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:47.838
PART IN PART FOR WHICH IS THE

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.240
CONGREGATE CARE PIECE I THINK

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:50.474
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.076
FOR US TO TALK ABOUT.

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.677
TODAY -- HAPPY TO DO A MORE FULL

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:55.346
BRIEF AT SOME OTHER TIME BUT I

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:56.413
THINK THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.415
ARE REALLY -- IMPACT US THE MOST

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:02.186
AND SO -- THE THE THE THE THE

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:03.254
FAMILIES FIRST ACTIVE -- IF FOR

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.155
THE FIRST TIME KIND OF CRACKS

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:07.658
THE DOOR OPEN FOR STATES AND AND

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:09.093
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO USE

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:11.395
FEDERAL FOR E. FUNDING FOR

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:13.163
SERVICES HISTORICALLY THE FORTY

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.099
FUNDING HAS BEEN USED -- FOR

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:16.166
KAREN SUPERVISION AND

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:17.768
ADMINISTRATION CASE WORK THAT

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:18.602
KIND OF THING.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:22.139
THE THE THE FOR THE FIRST -- THE

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:26.277
FIRST SECTION THE WITH OFTEN

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.578
KNOWN AS PART.

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:29.179
ONE IS -- AN OPTIONAL AN

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:30.814
OPTIONAL -- PROGRAMS THAT WOULD

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:31.682
BE THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO OPT

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.918
INTO IT AND IT ALLOWS -- FOR AND

00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:35.252
IT CAN ONLY BE OPTED INTO ONCE

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:37.354
PARK FOR IS IN IN OPERATION SO

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.489
IN OTHER WORDS YOU DO THAT

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.157
CONGREGATE CARE PIECE THEN YOU

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.993
CAN OPT IN TO THE TO THE

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.128
PREVENTION PIECE.

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:46.463
IT ALLOWS FOR SERVICES AND FOR

CANDIDATES FOR FOSTER CARE SO IN

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.304
OTHER WORDS IF WITHOUT SOME KIND

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.805
OF INTERVENTION THEY WOULD BE

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:55.906
REMOVED FROM THEIR HOME?

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:57.875
ALLOWS SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED

TO THEM OR THEIR FAMILIES IN

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:02.279
KIND OF THREE THREE AREAS.

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:04.114
ONE IS -- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.916

PARENTING A SERVICES -- AND AND

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:12.923
A AND THE AND THE THE LOS

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.491
PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHICH

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.126
PROGRAMS YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE OF

00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:17.561
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.997
CREATED A LIST THAT -- IS MODEST

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.967
AT PRESENT -- AND POTENTIALLY

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.802
COULD GROW -- BASED ON BASED ON

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.003
A MORE EVIDENCE OF THESE ARE

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.838
EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS DECIDED

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:28.639
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:30.107
CAN BE USED.

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.109
IN THESE PARTS FOR THESE

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:35.546
PURPOSES -- IT IN IN PART FOR

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:37.514
THE AND I'LL COME BACK A LITTLE

00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:38.983
BIT TO THE IMPACT OF THOSE SEE

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:39.984
IF AT THE END.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.151
SO IT IN PART FOR THERE'S WITH

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:42.720
IT IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH IT'S

00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:44.621
SIMILAR TO BUT NOT EXACTLY THE

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:46.557
SAME AS THE KIND OF THINGS WE'VE

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:47.658
BEEN DOING WITH C. C. R..

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:50.427
IT IS IT HAS FOUR KIND OF AREAS

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.395
WHERE THERE'S THE TO THE WAY

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.230
THINGS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.898
ONE IS THAT THE THE FEDS.

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.600
HAVE DESCRIBED THIS QUALIFIED

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.135
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM

00:43:58.202 --> 00:44:00.104
SIMILAR TO OUR S. T. R. T. P.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.739
HOWEVER THE THE ADMISSION

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:04.108
CRITERIA ISN'T IS NARROWER MUCH

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:07.578
IT MORE -- MORE -- CLINICAL IT

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:08.579
CAN BE AND LESS BEHAVIOR --

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:11.148
LET'S SAY THAN WE HAVE IN OUR IN

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:13.050
OUR IN OUR CURRENT LAW.

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.485
REQUIRES THAT NURSING --

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.421
SERVICES BE AVAILABLE TWENTY

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:18.655
FOUR SEVEN IT DOES SAY DEPENDING

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:19.623
ON THE PROGRAM WORSE WERE

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.158
SEEKING CLARIFICATION TO SEE

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:22.426
WHAT THAT IS THAT HOW THAT COULD

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:23.494
BE IMPLEMENTED HERE.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.329
THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:26.430
FROM OUR STR TEEPEES IS THERE

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:28.499
REALLY A SOCIAL MODEL ONE NOT A

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.267
MEDICAL MODEL -- IT ALSO

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:32.069
REQUIRES AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:33.103
THAT'S NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.705
STATE THE COUNTY OR THE PROVIDER

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.473
TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.508
THAT YOU WHETHER THE YOUNG

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:39.543
PERSON SHOULD BE -- IT MATED TO

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.745
THAT FACILITY -- THE FEDS CAN

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:43.313
WAIVE THAT AND WE BELIEVE WE

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.982
HAVE OUR PROCESS IT FROM C. C.

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:47.785
R. WAS WOULD LIKELY MEET IT'S ME

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:49.920
TAKE THEIR THAT THE THE INTEREST

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.221
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN IN

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:52.256
IN IN THAT.

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.725
AND IT ALSO REQUIRES -- POSTED

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:57.594
DISCHARGE FROM THE FROM THE THE

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:59.196
THE THE Q. R. T. P. -- SIX

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.998
MONTHS OF AFTER CARE SERVICES

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:02.800
AND THAT IS A IS IS SOMEWHAT

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.501
TICKET THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN

00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:06.403
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN IN OUR IN OUR

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:07.905
S. T. OUR G. P..

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:09.306
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OFTEN THE

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:09.940
FOLKS?

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:11.809
WHO HAVE HAVE TALK WHO TALK

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.644
ABOUT -- THE FAMILY'S FIRST ACT

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:24.588
THINK ABOUT IT AS AS EIGHT

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:27.424
CONTINUE.

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:28.092
AN EXTENSION IF YOU WILL.

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:29.660
A TRIP FROM OF FOR FROM TO THE

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:30.861
WAY FROM A WAIVER SO.

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:31.862
IF YOU RECALL WITH NOT THE LAW

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:32.830
PASSED THE FEDERAL LAW PASSED

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:33.730
AND ARE AND THE FORTY WAIVERS

00:45:33.797 --> 00:45:36.366
THAT MANY STATES ENJOY INCLUDING

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:37.401
OURS.

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:38.802
THE SUN SETS AT DURING THAT TIME

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:39.336
PERIOD THERE WAS THIS THAT

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:39.970
SUGGESTION THAT THE THE THE NEW

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:41.505
ACT WOULD ALLOW -- FOR DOES MANY

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:42.940
OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WAIVER

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:43.774
COUNTIES ARE STATES TO TO BE

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:45.476
FUNDED IN THAT SO IN THAT PART.

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.044

OTHER JURISDICTIONS I SHOULD

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:22.846
MENTION SINCE THE IT'S IT'S

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:24.248
OFTEN TALKED ABOUT IN IN

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:26.250

SUPPORT EDUCATION -- TASK FORCE --

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.048

DISTRICT BY SCHOOL DISTRICT KIND

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:59.202
OF BASIS TO SEE HOW.

HOW HOW PERFORMANCE IS HAPPENING

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.438
SOME OF THE THE THINGS THAT I

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:03.273
THINK YEAH YOU MENTIONED EARLIER

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.274
ONE OF THE MANY?

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:05.308
OFTEN THE SCHOOL -- POOR SCHOOL

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.444
PERFORMANCE IS TIED TO

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.813
INSTABILITY OF PLACEMENT AND SO

00:54:09.879 --> 00:54:12.549
IF WE CAN -- REDUCE PLACEMENT

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:14.417
MOVES WE ALSO REDUCE SCHOOL

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:15.785
MOVES.

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.988
AND SO WE ARE -- WE'RE FOCUSING

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:20.056
ON THAT AREA -- MOVE LARGELY BY

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.025

THROUGH OUR CHILD AND FAMILY

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:26.663
TEAM PROCESS WILL TALK ABOUT

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.832
MORE IN C. C. R. BUT THROUGH BUT

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.100
THROUGH A WHOLE BUNCH AND

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:32.469
PROVIDING -- FOSTER PARENTS AND

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:34.104
RELATIVE CARE GIVERS WHAT THEY

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.439
NEED TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT COME

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.341
UP AS A RESULT OF KIDS DEALING

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:40.110
WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA SO WE'RE

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:40.910
LOOK WORKING ON PLACEMENT

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:42.779
STABILITY WE ALSO NEED TO DO A

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:49.285
BETTER JOB OF OF OF WE THERE IS --

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.121
PROVISIONS IN LAW THAT ALLOW FOR

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:52.155
IT YOU KNOW UNDER REASONABLE

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:53.690

WITH THEIR SIBLINGS.

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:58.561
AND SO I THINK WE WE ARE

00:54:58.628 --> 00:54:59.696

SCALE OR IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:56.199
SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT SO I

00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:57.233
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.501
OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT TO GET

00:58:58.568 --> 00:58:59.002
THE VALUATION DATA AND

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:00.236
APPRECIATE THE UPDATE ON THE

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.838
EVALUATION -- BUT I'M ALSO

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:03.139
THINKING LIKE OKAY.

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.074
CELLS THE END DON'T KNOW YET

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:05.675
BECAUSE VALUE WHICH HAS TO BE

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.110
COMPLETED BUT IF IT SOUNDS

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:09.746
PROMISING WE SHOULD BE STARTING

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:10.346
TO THINK ABOUT OKAY.

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.514
THE THINGS THAT SEEM TO BE

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:12.548
WORKING REALLY WELL HOW DO YOU

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.350
BRING THAT SCALE AND GET MORE

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:17.053
PEOPLE AND MORE RESOURCES -- THE

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.255
I'D START TO MAKE NOTE THAT --

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:20.523
IS YOU MENTION ON THE FEDERAL

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.391
LEVEL THE FAMILIES FIRST

00:59:21.457 --> 00:59:23.192
PREVENTION SERVICES ACT YOU DID

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:24.961
MENTION WERE LOSING HUNDREDS OF

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.396
MILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.531
POTENTIALLY - BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:31.200
LINED UP FOR THE DAY CARE THAT

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:33.002
RIGHT OR NOT.

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:35.171
YES I I THINK ULTIMATELY SO THE

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:37.173
THERE THERE ARE AT ACT ACT --

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.443
FEDERAL IS -- ACTIVITIES BY A

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.078
CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AND OTHERS

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:44.280
OTHER STATES TO LOOK AT OPTIONS

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.915
TO EXTEND THE WAIVER UNDER THE

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:48.551
CURRENT SITUATION WHAT -- WHAT I

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:50.787
WAS DESCRIBING IS THAT -- THERE

00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:52.221
THAT SAYS COUNTIES ARE AT RISK

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:53.623
OF FOR LOSING SOME OF THE

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.291
FEDERAL FUNDS THAT THEY'RE

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:56.259
THEY'RE FEDERAL ALLOCATION WILL

00:59:56.326 --> 01:00:00.596
WILL WILL WILL WILL DROP -- AS A

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:01.931
RESULT OF THE THE WAIVER AND

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:02.966
THAT KIND OF WHAT I WOULD ARGUE

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.000
THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.336
FAMILIES FIRST ACT FOR WHAT THEY

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:07.103
HAPPEN TO BE.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.906
HAPPEN TO BE DOING -- SO THERE

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:12.675
WE WE ARE SO DO WE HAVE A PLAN

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.410
FOR IF THAT HAPPENS I THE OF

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:15.712
REAL CERTAINLY LEASE HUNDREDS OF

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.147
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:19.215
SYSTEM.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.416
AS A RESULT OF THAT EVERY.

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:21.818
THE READ.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.219
ARE WE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.454
GONNA DO ABOUT THAT OR DO YOU

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.588
SIMPLY SAY WHAT WE LOST A FEW

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:26.923
HUNDRED MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.559
ARE WE GONNA TRY HAVE TO MAKE UP

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:30.126
SOME ATTITUDE RELY I'M JUST

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:30.860
TRYING.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.295
TO I I HEARD THE LOSS OF HUNDRED

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:33.563
HAVE BEEN HERE PLAN ABOUT OKAY

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:34.597
WE'LL LOGIN DO ABOUT IT RIGHT

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:35.932
WITHOUT ZERO BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:36.666
SELL.

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.101
SPEAKING ABOUT OKAY WHAT WHAT

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:41.270
WHAT DO I NEED TO BE PUTTING A

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:44.407
MARKER ON JUST JUST RAISED FROM

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.308
FRANCE I THINK I JUST WANT.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.209
TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT WE'RE

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:46.809
TALKING AT THE THE END OF THE

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:48.745
TITLE FOR E. WAIVER RIGHT YEAH

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.680
ENDS I THINK OF CORRECT IT'S

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.715
COMMITTEE CORRECT OKAY IN IN THE

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:53.783
PARTS SEVEN COUNTIES -- COUNTY

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:54.851
TO PARTICIPATE IN AND AT THE

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:55.485
TIME KNEW THAT IT WAS A WAY FOR

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.353
OUR THAT IT'S BEEN EXTENDED A

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:01.524
FEW TIMES BY THE FENCE SO --

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:04.060
IT'S EIGHT EIGHT I GUESS THE THE

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:05.161
THE THE EASIEST WAY TO PUT IT IS

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:05.762
THAT COUNTIES HAVE BEEN AWARE

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:06.362
THAT THIS.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.164
THAT THE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.933
USE OF THE THAT OF THE TITLE FOR

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.935
YOU EVER FINDS -- WOULD END AT

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.737
SOME POINTS FOR THAT THEY SHOULD

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.305
BE IN THE PLANNING AHEAD TO KIND

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:17.473
OF ADDRESS.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.842
HOW THEY WOULD -- HOW THAT GAP

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.477
THAT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY --

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.146
END UP -- MISSING OUT ON WOULD

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.614
WORK BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.848
THERE IS.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.016
THAT THERE'S ANY SORT OF

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.584
ADDITIONAL PLAN BEYOND THAT AT

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:30.853
THE MOMENT SO I GUESS -- EVEN IF

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.455
YOU QUOTE NOW AND I APPRECIATE

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.123
PEOPLE KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.492
ADVANCE.

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.795
DID I FORGET THE HELPFUL.

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.596
THIS WEBSITE WE KNOW IS IF WE'RE

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.065
GONNA LOSE HUNDRED DALE I DON'T

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:42.665
KNOW HOW MANY HUNDRED MILLION

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:43.032
EVER.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.567
LIKE AROUND THREE HUNDRED OKAY

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:46.469
SO MY GUESS IS THAT LOSS OF

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:47.837
THREE HUNDRED MILLION WHAT WE

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.105
SHOULD DO ABOUT IT NOW WE'LL

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.106
FIGURE OUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:51.741
BUT LOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:52.442
IS PROBABLY.

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:59.148
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT JUST GONNA

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:01.451
HAPPEN AND WITHOUT SOME

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:04.287
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT GREAT.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:05.822
YES I WOULD SITES I WOULD I

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:06.956
WOULD SAY THIS THAT THE A AS

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:07.557
MISTER FREEZE SAID THIS WAS A

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.224
CHILD WELFARE WAIVER

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.292
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.660
THE THE THE HOPE I THINK FROM

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.061
THE STATES AND JURISDICTIONS

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.296
THAT DID THE DEMONSTRATION WAS

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:14.397
THEY WOULD DEMONSTRATE

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.799
ACTIVITIES THAT MADE SENSE AND

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.601
THOSE WOULD ULTIMATELY MAKE IT

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.937
INTO WHATEVER THE FINANCE REFORM

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.472
OR THE FEDERAL LAW CHANGE WOULD

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:22.972
BE.

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.740
WITH THAT DID NOT NECESSARILY

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:26.876
HAPPEN FOR US IN IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:28.411
ALL THE COUNTIES PER THE TERMS

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.245
AND CONDITIONS DO YOU HAVE A

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.980
FACE DOWN PLAN AND THINGS LIKE

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.815
THAT SO THEY'RE OF MECHANISMS IN

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:36.452
PLACE -- THE OVER THAT SO IS

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:38.488
THERE SO I I IMAGINE THAT I

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:39.722
CAN'T READ THE MIND OF THE SAID

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:40.756
BY A MANAGER THEY SAID OKAY --

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:41.924
WE GIVE THESE WAIVERS PEOPLE DO

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:42.959
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WILL

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.627
DECIDE WHICH ONES WE THINK WORK

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.229
BEST WHETHER WE AGREE OR NOT

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.598
HERE BUT SO WE ASKING PEOPLE

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.466
THAT THEN TRY TO LINE UP WITH US.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.068
SO THAT WE CASE WITH WHAT THE

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:52.969
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CURRENTLY

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.303
PROPOSING OR IS THAT SOMETHING

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:55.004
THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:56.372
AGREE WITH IN TERMS I'M JUST

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.107
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHERE

01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:58.741
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO AFTER THE

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.510
WAIVERS -- COUPLE THINGS VOTE

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.545
WILL LIKELY WILL WILL IMPLEMENT

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.081
THE FEDERAL LAW IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.115
ONE THE WAIVER EXPIRES IN IT

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:16.859
BEFORE THAT -- CERTAINLY THE THE

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:18.494
THE WE CAN WORK WITH OUR COUNTY

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:19.028
COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS TO

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:19.629
IMPLEMENT THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:20.196
THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:21.464
THE THE PREVENTION PIECE IT'S

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:23.032
NOT EXACTLY WHAT THE THEY'RE

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.133
DOING FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.068
INTERVENTION NOW WOULD BE

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.637
DIFFERENT AND AS I SAID.

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.539
BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH OF IT

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.907
COULD BE MEDI CAL --

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:32.441
REIMBURSABLE THERE'S A QUESTION

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.010
ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN REALLY DO

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.611
YOU AND THEY WON'T THE AND WE

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:37.113
HAVE TO DETERMINE THAT MEDI CAL

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.481
COULDN'T DO SOMETHING BEFORE WE

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.183
COULD USE THE FORTY CLEARLY.

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.450
BUT THAT IT WILL BE USING THE

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.519
NEXT TWO YEARS OUR THAT'S OUR

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:44.921
TOP TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:45.988
ADDITION TO BE LINING UP WHAT WE

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:47.490
NEED TO DO TO IMPLEMENT PART FOR

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:48.324
BECAUSE IT'S THE LAW.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:51.661
WE WILL BE WORKING ON A WAYS TO

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:53.663
MATT TO TO LOOK AT BOB HOW

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:55.398
COLLUDED WITH SOME OF THESE

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:56.866
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE CANDIDATES

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:59.368
AND THEIR FAMILIES GET SERVICES.

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:00.803
AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.672
LOBBYING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:05.808
TO EXPAND THE LIST -- WE HAVE.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.343
MANY MANY STATES HAVE THAT THE

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.312
THAT WE KNOW THAT THE LIST OF

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.180
APPROVED PROGRAMS WILL IN FACT

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:12.515
GROW THERE ARE SOME VERY

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.717
SPECIFIC KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.185
RELATE RELATED TO KIND OF

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:18.020
RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.388
WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.123
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.960
SEEN -- PROMISING OUTCOMES AND

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.695
TO DETERMINE IT TO TO MAKE THAT

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:28.698
LESS SO -- WE WILL BE DOING WHAT

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.132
WE CAN TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:33.135
COLLEGE TO MAXIMIZE WHATEVER WE

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.271
CAN FROM THE CURRENT THE NEW

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.173
FEDERAL LAW ALL RIGHT SO --

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.408
SINCE WE HAVE THE SELF WHEN

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:40.009
THINGS LET'S PUT A MARKER ON

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:42.345
THIS THAT DELVE INTO MORE DEEPLY

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.280
E. IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO YEARS

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:45.548
RIGHT HE SAID ROUGHLY CELL BY

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.250
NEXT YEAR WE DEFINITELY BETTER

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:50.219
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:58.961
IF THE SO THE THAT'S OUR

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.763
OFFICIALLY FOLLOW THIS OKAY.

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:01.797
ALL RIGHT NOW THANK YOU AND THAT

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:02.431
THEY REALIZE THAT YOU'RE WORKING

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.799
WITH IN THIS FEDERAL CONSTRUCT

03:03:40.209 --> 03:03:41.643
CLEARLY THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE

03:03:41.710 --> 03:03:43.045
DONE THERE AND AND THE OTHER

03:03:43.112 --> 03:03:44.747
QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WHAT

03:03:44.813 --> 03:03:45.748
HAPPENED.

03:03:45.814 --> 03:03:47.516
OR HOW WHAT WAS WHAT HOW IS THE

03:03:47.583 --> 03:03:49.485
MONEY USE AND WE'VE SEEN IT

03:03:49.551 --> 03:03:50.953
BEING USED IN OVERTIME.

03:03:51.019 --> 03:03:53.255
SOME SOFTWARE PACKAGES WE'VE

03:03:53.322 --> 03:03:55.924
SEEN IT BEING USED -- TO BOX

03:03:55.991 --> 03:03:57.626
PROVIDE AND BY MOBILE I'VE

03:03:57.693 --> 03:03:58.927
SCANNED MACHINE SO THAT THINGS

03:03:58.994 --> 03:04:00.295
COULD BE DONE OUT IN THE FIELD

03:04:00.362 --> 03:04:01.764
AND SO WE'VE SEEN OF THOSE AT

03:04:01.830 --> 03:04:03.332
THOSE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS SOME

03:04:03.399 --> 03:04:05.901
JUST SOME SOME CHANGES WITHIN IN

03:04:05.968 --> 03:04:06.769
SOME DEPARTMENTS ABOUT.

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:08.570
HALF ALL HANDS ON DECK TO CLEAR

03:04:08.637 --> 03:04:11.607
THE BACKLOG -- AS A AS A RESULT

03:04:11.673 --> 03:04:19.314
AT RESULTING IN THE THE CHANGES

03:04:19.381 --> 03:04:20.182
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER.

03:04:20.249 --> 03:04:21.250
AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE THE

03:04:21.316 --> 03:04:23.952
LEVEL OF CARE -- PROTOCOL BUT

03:04:24.019 --> 03:04:25.721
I'D SAY IT WHEN I WHEN I WHEN I

03:04:25.788 --> 03:04:26.655
THE THERE IS THE QUESTION IS A

03:04:26.722 --> 03:04:27.723
KIND WHEN WILL BE BE DONE I

03:04:27.790 --> 03:04:28.323
THINK IS HOW I READ IT RIGHT.

03:04:28.390 --> 03:04:29.391
AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS

03:04:29.458 --> 03:04:30.859
I'D SAY WE DID DO EVER RECOVER

03:04:30.926 --> 03:04:32.227
RELIABILITY STUDY OF OF OF WHILE

03:04:32.294 --> 03:04:33.762
BACK IN IT DETERMINED THAT THE

03:04:33.829 --> 03:04:36.064
THE THE TOOL WAS WAS WAS ROBBERY

03:04:36.131 --> 03:04:37.833
WAS REASONABLY RELIABLE.

03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:39.601
AND THE NEXT STEP WAS TO THEN

03:04:39.668 --> 03:04:40.335

AND THE WE ARE DOING THAT NOW AT

03:04:52.314 --> 03:04:53.449
THE SAME TIME WE'VE DEVELOPED

03:04:53.515 --> 03:04:56.151
THE VALIDITY STUDY AND WE WENT

03:04:56.218 --> 03:04:56.952

BECOMING LICENSED AND THEN

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:07.329
CERTIFIED AND THEN GETTING A

03:10:07.395 --> 03:10:08.597
MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTOR

03:10:08.663 --> 03:10:09.831
CONSIDERABLE.

03:10:09.898 --> 03:10:11.466
AND WE THINK THAT IT'S INCUMBENT

03:10:11.533 --> 03:10:13.201
UPON ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT

03:10:13.268 --> 03:10:14.569
WAYS TO DEVELOP.

03:10:14.636 --> 03:10:16.538

03:10:18.373 --> 03:10:19.441
THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE HIGH

03:10:19.508 --> 03:10:21.042

PARTICIPATE IN STATE FUNDING AND

03:10:38.260 --> 03:10:39.361
SO WE THINK THAT'S THE DATE THAT

03:10:39.427 --> 03:10:42.230
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE VISIT

03:10:42.297 --> 03:10:43.565

THE OTHER THING WE'D LIKE TO

03:13:57.759 --> 03:13:58.994
ELEVATE IS THAT WE NEED TO

03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:00.895
DRAMATICALLY CHANGE HOW WE LOOK

03:14:00.962 --> 03:14:02.731
AT THE FORMULA OF HOW WHEN AND

03:14:02.797 --> 03:14:04.699

AND MANY OF THEM IDENTIFIES LGBT

03:14:16.144 --> 03:14:19.481
Q. I EIGHT AND THEY ARE OLDER.

SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

03:14:20.615 --> 03:14:22.751
FAIR PER PLANS AND WE LOOK AT

03:14:22.817 --> 03:14:24.953
HOW ARE IS THIS NEW MONEY BEING

03:14:25.020 --> 03:14:27.589
USED -- A PLANE AND EQUITY LANDS

03:14:27.655 --> 03:14:30.291
A BASED ON WHO THIS POPULATION

03:14:30.358 --> 03:14:32.394
IS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE WANT TO

03:14:32.460 --> 03:14:33.528
ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY IS BEING

03:14:33.595 --> 03:14:35.797
USED ON EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS.

03:14:35.864 --> 03:14:37.665
THAT IT IS EQUITY BASED AND THAT

03:14:37.732 --> 03:14:39.100
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TRAUMA THAT

03:14:39.167 --> 03:14:39.768
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

03:14:39.834 --> 03:14:42.837
EXPERIENCING WITHIN THE CHILD

03:22:55.530 --> 03:22:56.898
MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD I FROM

03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:59.166
THE COUNTY STANDPOINT WE SORT OF

03:22:59.233 --> 03:23:01.669
A GREEN PARDON DISAGREE IN PART --

03:23:01.736 --> 03:23:05.172
THE THE IDEA THAT -- THERE WAS

03:23:05.239 --> 03:23:06.440
ALL IT WAS ALWAYS THE COUNTY'S

03:23:06.507 --> 03:23:08.709
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO FOSTER

03:23:08.776 --> 03:23:11.078
PEREGRINE IT'S TRUE -- BUT THAT

03:23:11.145 --> 03:23:12.914
WAS WHEN THE LAWS DIDN'T

03:23:12.980 --> 03:23:15.416
PROSCRIBED THE USE OF CONGREGATE

03:23:15.483 --> 03:23:16.851
CARE FACILITIES -- AND

03:23:16.918 --> 03:23:18.619
COMPLETELY CHANGE THE FOSTER

03:23:18.686 --> 03:23:19.520
CARE SYSTEM SO THE

03:23:19.587 --> 03:23:21.989
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. TO

03:23:22.056 --> 03:23:23.891
PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY

03:23:23.958 --> 03:23:25.059
TO ALLOW THE COUNTIES TO BE

03:23:25.126 --> 03:23:27.261
SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING C. C.

03:23:27.328 --> 03:23:28.796
R. WHICH IS THE LEGISLATIVE

03:23:28.863 --> 03:23:30.865
REQUIREMENT I THINK CHANGED THE

03:23:30.932 --> 03:23:31.933
NATURE.

03:23:31.999 --> 03:23:33.601
OF WHAT THE OBLIGATIONS WERE

03:23:33.668 --> 03:23:34.535
BETWEEN THE STATE IN THE

03:23:34.602 --> 03:23:36.904
COUNTIES PRIOR.

03:23:36.971 --> 03:23:37.538
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I THINK THE

03:23:37.605 --> 03:23:38.673
OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS

03:23:38.739 --> 03:23:40.875
THAT THE IDEA THAT FLIPPERS OR

03:23:40.942 --> 03:23:42.209
FOR THE ENHANCED FOSTER PARENT

03:23:42.276 --> 03:23:43.444
RECRUITMENT RETENTION IS SOMEHOW

03:23:43.511 --> 03:23:44.645
SOMETHING.

03:23:44.712 --> 03:23:46.080
THAT YOU ONLY NEED TO FUND UP

03:23:46.147 --> 03:23:49.183
FRONT AND THEN ONCE THAT HAPPENS

03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:53.287
WERE GOOD -- IT'S FLAWED.

03:23:53.354 --> 03:23:54.755
LARGELY BECAUSE MANY OF THE

03:23:54.822 --> 03:23:55.990
FAMILIES THAT WERE RECRUITING

03:23:56.057 --> 03:23:57.692
AND SUPPORTING A RELATIVE CARE

03:23:57.758 --> 03:23:58.826
GIVERS.

03:23:58.893 --> 03:24:02.330
AND WE ASK THEM TO COME INTO --

03:24:02.396 --> 03:24:04.098
OUR SYSTEM IN CARE FOR THEIR CAN

03:24:04.165 --> 03:24:05.733
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY WERE

03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:07.068
LOOKING TO DO WE KNOCKED ON

03:24:07.134 --> 03:24:08.436
THEIR THE IT ON THEIR DOOR.

03:24:08.502 --> 03:24:10.237
VERY FEW OF THEM WHEN THAT CHILD

03:24:10.304 --> 03:24:11.973
REACHES PERMANENCY OR REACHES

03:24:12.039 --> 03:24:14.008
MAJORITY SAYS.

03:24:14.075 --> 03:24:14.976
HEY I'VE BEEN RECRUITED THAT

03:24:15.042 --> 03:24:16.410
USED PEPPERS MONEY I'M GOING TO

03:24:16.477 --> 03:24:19.480
STAY IN THE POOL AND SO.

03:24:19.547 --> 03:24:22.283
THE NEED FOR A HIGH A NUMBER OF

03:24:22.350 --> 03:24:24.151
HIGH QUALITY FAMILIES TO CARE

03:24:24.218 --> 03:24:26.287
FOR CHILDREN GIVEN THAT MANY OF

03:24:26.354 --> 03:24:27.288
THEM ARE GOING TO BE RELATIVES

03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:29.557
MEANS THE WORK NEVER ENDS.

03:24:29.624 --> 03:24:31.192
THE INTENSITY OF THE ON GOING

03:24:31.258 --> 03:24:33.194
WORK NEVER ENDS AND SO I DON'T

03:24:33.260 --> 03:24:35.496
THINK THAT THE PREMISE THAT

03:24:35.563 --> 03:24:36.897
SOMEHOW FLIPPERS.

03:24:36.964 --> 03:24:39.800
IS A STATE OBLIGATION THAT ENDS

03:24:39.867 --> 03:24:42.036
AT SOME POINT IS CONSENT IS

03:24:42.103 --> 03:24:44.205
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE KNOW TO

03:24:44.271 --> 03:24:46.140
BE THE WAY C. C. R. IS ROLLING

03:24:46.207 --> 03:24:48.743
OUT.

03:24:48.809 --> 03:24:50.211
OKAY -- COMING FROM [inaudible]

03:24:50.277 --> 03:24:52.079
THE NEED.

03:24:52.146 --> 03:24:56.884
SUCH SERVICE TO THAT -- I THINK

03:24:56.951 --> 03:24:58.386
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD IS

03:24:58.452 --> 03:25:01.122
IS CRACKED -- I I THINK THOUGH

03:25:01.188 --> 03:25:02.289
IT'S A MISTAKE.

03:25:02.356 --> 03:25:04.325
THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THINGS

03:25:04.392 --> 03:25:05.860
ALTHOUGH WE BUDGET THEM BY LINE

03:25:05.926 --> 03:25:08.429
ITEM TO THINK THAT TE TOTALITY

03:25:08.496 --> 03:25:10.665
NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED AS AS

03:25:10.731 --> 03:25:12.500
INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS IN THE

03:25:12.566 --> 03:25:15.069
CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT WE'RE

03:25:15.136 --> 03:25:17.171
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH -- C. C. R.

03:25:17.238 --> 03:25:19.373
WAS NEVER INTENDED AS A FISCAL

03:25:19.440 --> 03:25:20.841
COST SAVING MEASURE.

03:25:20.908 --> 03:25:22.543
IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO

03:25:22.610 --> 03:25:24.178
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN

03:25:24.245 --> 03:25:25.446
AND FAMILIES.

03:25:25.513 --> 03:25:27.148
AND FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE BELIEFS

03:25:27.214 --> 03:25:29.150
REFLECTED LATER IN THE FEDERAL

03:25:29.216 --> 03:25:31.285
LAW FF PSA THAT WE DISCUSSED

03:25:31.352 --> 03:25:33.921
EARLIER -- THAT KIDS ARE BETTER

03:25:33.988 --> 03:25:35.022
IN HOME BASED FAMILY CARE

03:25:35.089 --> 03:25:37.158
SITUATIONS RATHER THAN

03:25:37.224 --> 03:25:38.526
CONGREGATE CARE SITUATIONS

03:25:38.592 --> 03:25:39.694
ALTHOUGH THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE

03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:41.195
ROLE OF COURSE FOR CONGREGATE

03:25:41.262 --> 03:25:42.663
CARE AS WELL.

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:44.465
BUT DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE IN

03:25:44.532 --> 03:25:45.900
DIFFERENT PLACES IN TERMS OF

03:25:45.966 --> 03:25:47.401
THEIR ABILITY SOME HAD ALREADY

03:25:47.468 --> 03:25:49.270
VERY LOW RATES OF CONGREGATE

03:25:49.336 --> 03:25:51.305
CARE -- CONGREGATE CARE ALSO

03:25:51.372 --> 03:25:53.274
TENDS TO BE VASTLY MORE

03:25:53.340 --> 03:25:55.776
EXPENSIVE -- IN PART BECAUSE OF

03:25:55.843 --> 03:25:57.478
THE NEED TO TREATMENT NEEDS OR

03:25:57.545 --> 03:25:59.313
THE SERVICE NEEDS OF THE

03:25:59.380 --> 03:26:01.482
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES -- AND THE

03:26:01.549 --> 03:26:02.750
REDUCTION IN THAT CONGREGATE

03:26:02.817 --> 03:26:05.619
CARE ALSO PROVIDES A IS A

03:26:05.686 --> 03:26:07.121
REDUCTION IN PLACEMENTS AND

03:26:07.188 --> 03:26:08.823
CONGREGATE CARE NOT ONLY

03:26:08.889 --> 03:26:10.491
PROVIDES IMMEDIATE MONTH TO

03:26:10.558 --> 03:26:12.593
MONTH FISCAL SAVINGS RELATIVE TO

03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:14.295
A HOME BASED PLACEMENT.

03:26:14.361 --> 03:26:15.629
BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAN A

03:26:15.696 --> 03:26:17.231
CONVERSATION ABOUT PLACEMENT

03:26:17.298 --> 03:26:18.799
STABILITY.

03:26:18.866 --> 03:26:20.201
PLACEMENT DURATION.

03:26:20.267 --> 03:26:22.737
OF THE LIFE OUTCOMES OF THE USE

03:26:22.803 --> 03:26:23.904
AND THE NUMBER OF ACES THAT

03:26:23.971 --> 03:26:25.473
THEY'RE EXPOSED.

03:26:25.539 --> 03:26:27.174
TO THE NUMBER OF RELATIONSHIPS

03:26:27.241 --> 03:26:29.343
THAT MAY BE ENDED OR MAINTAINED

03:26:29.410 --> 03:26:31.445
SO I I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO

03:26:31.512 --> 03:26:32.813
THINK ABOUT.

03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:34.982
INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS ALTHOUGH

03:26:35.049 --> 03:26:37.017
THEY'RE IMPORTANT -- WE NEED TO

03:26:37.084 --> 03:26:38.185
BE FOCUSED ON THE OUTCOMES WERE

03:26:38.252 --> 03:26:39.520
TRYING TO WILL SHE EVEN FIGURE

03:26:39.587 --> 03:26:41.589
OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THERE

03:26:41.655 --> 03:26:42.857
AS A WHOLE PACKAGE.

03:26:42.923 --> 03:26:44.358
I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN PART OF

03:26:44.425 --> 03:26:46.093
MY QUESTION IS IS REALLY COMES

03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:48.162
DOWN TO OKAY WELL WE HAVE A

03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:51.398
CERTAIN DREAM AND STRUCTURE.

03:26:51.465 --> 03:26:51.899
IN TERMS OF HOW WE LABEL

03:26:51.966 --> 03:26:53.234
DIFFERENT.

03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:55.803
PIECES OF MONEY [inaudible]

03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:59.707
CURRENTLY AND LIVING.

03:26:59.774 --> 03:27:02.409
FOR STATE SO AND THE VALUES YOU

03:27:02.476 --> 03:27:03.043
SEE THIS PART SHARDS THEY WILL

03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.811
WORDS MAY ACTUALLY GO AND IT'S

03:27:03.878 --> 03:27:05.579
GOING TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:27:05.646 --> 03:27:06.180
THINGS AND THE QUESTION IS IS

03:27:06.247 --> 03:27:07.014
THAT.

03:27:07.081 --> 03:27:10.518
IS THE TOTAL LEVEL SUPPORT.

03:27:10.584 --> 03:27:13.020
NECESSARY THERE AND MAYBE IF.

03:27:13.087 --> 03:27:14.822
WE MORE SPECIFICALLY LABEL LIKE

03:27:14.889 --> 03:27:15.790
OKAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO BOOST

03:27:15.856 --> 03:27:18.492
MONEY UP HERE FOR THIS PURPOSE

03:27:18.559 --> 03:27:20.127
AND SO FORTH BUT THAT.

03:27:20.194 --> 03:27:22.363
THE GUY A ON VERSES LIKE -- WELL

03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:23.564
ENOUGH SO WE REDUCING THIS AND

03:27:23.631 --> 03:27:24.398
WE'RE INCREASING THIS ONLY JUST

03:27:24.465 --> 03:27:25.432
REDUCING THIS.

03:27:25.499 --> 03:27:26.267
RIGHT AND CERTAINLY I THINK THE

03:27:26.333 --> 03:27:29.804
THE SPEAKS TO THE NEED -- FOR

03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:30.404
SAID YOU RECRUITING FAMILIES

03:27:30.471 --> 03:27:33.174
THEY NEED TO KNOW THE SUPPORT IS

03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:34.241
THERE A DATE DATE.

03:27:34.308 --> 03:27:36.177
IT'S IT'S NOT THAT'S GOING TO GO

03:27:36.243 --> 03:27:37.144
AWAY AND THERE'S ALWAYS NEW

03:27:37.211 --> 03:27:38.813
FAMILIES RIGHT THERE'S

03:27:38.879 --> 03:27:40.080
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NEW KIDS

03:27:40.147 --> 03:27:41.549
TO ENTER TO SYSTEM AND THERE'S

03:27:41.615 --> 03:27:42.917
NEW FOSTER FAMILIES AND I THINK

03:27:42.983 --> 03:27:44.418
IT IS I JUST HAVE TO SAY IN THE

03:27:44.485 --> 03:27:44.718
SHORT RUN.

03:27:44.785 --> 03:27:45.786
THE URGENT QUESTION AS ARE THE

03:27:45.853 --> 03:27:47.087
RESOURCES GOING TO BE THERE FOR

03:27:47.154 --> 03:27:49.990
COUNTIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO

03:27:50.057 --> 03:27:51.559
IMPLEMENT THE STATE MANDATES.

03:27:51.625 --> 03:27:53.360
IF IN A IF IN A LONGER RUN OR

03:27:53.427 --> 03:27:54.829
MEDIUM TERM RUN THE STATE WANTS

03:27:54.895 --> 03:27:55.996
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE

03:27:56.063 --> 03:27:56.964
COUNTIES ABOUT.

03:27:57.031 --> 03:27:59.033
CHANGING THE NATURE OF HOW WE

03:27:59.099 --> 03:28:00.634
FIND ON AN ONGOING BASIS C. C.

03:28:00.701 --> 03:28:01.368
R..

03:28:01.435 --> 03:28:02.670
THAT THE CONVERSATION WE'RE

03:28:02.736 --> 03:28:09.877
HAPPY TO HAVE WE CAN'T REDEFINED

03:28:09.944 --> 03:28:11.612
PROP.

03:28:11.679 --> 03:28:12.079
THIRTY THAT'S IN THE

03:28:12.146 --> 03:28:12.780
CONSTITUTION -- BUT TO THE

03:28:12.847 --> 03:28:13.414
EXTENT THAT WE CAN WORK WITHIN

03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:14.248
THE BOUNDS OF PROP THIRTY IN

03:28:14.315 --> 03:28:14.548
TALK ABOUT.

03:28:14.615 --> 03:28:15.449
DIFFERENT MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO

03:28:15.516 --> 03:28:16.884
FUND THE PROGRAM TO GET THE

03:28:16.951 --> 03:28:18.285
OUTCOMES MAKE WE WANT WE SAY.

03:28:18.352 --> 03:28:20.321
ABSOLUTELY BUT IN THE SHORT RUN

03:28:20.387 --> 03:28:21.789
I'M TELLING YOU FROM THE COUNTY

03:28:21.856 --> 03:28:23.958
STANDPOINT IF WE PULL THE RUG

03:28:24.024 --> 03:28:25.860
OUT FROM UNDER OUR A FANFIC PERS

03:28:25.926 --> 03:28:30.798
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SUCCEED.

03:28:30.865 --> 03:28:31.532
YOU KNOW I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE

03:28:31.599 --> 03:28:33.167
SUPPORT WHAT'S CONTAINED IN THE

03:28:33.234 --> 03:28:34.635
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND BUT

03:28:34.702 --> 03:28:36.370
WE'RE ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THE

03:28:36.437 --> 03:28:39.106
WORLD IS NOT STATIC AND WE WOULD

03:28:39.173 --> 03:28:40.341
BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE

03:28:40.407 --> 03:28:41.375
CONVERSATIONS.

03:28:41.442 --> 03:28:42.977
YOU DON'T GET KIDS OUT OF

03:28:43.043 --> 03:28:44.511
CONGREGATE CARE WITHOUT HOME

03:28:44.578 --> 03:28:45.913
BASE PLACEMENTS TO PUT THEM IN

03:28:45.980 --> 03:28:47.448
THAT'S WHAT THE FLIPPERS MONEY

03:28:47.514 --> 03:28:50.184
WAS ALL ABOUT.

03:28:50.251 --> 03:28:51.185
MISTER MAC IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

03:28:51.252 --> 03:28:51.919
NOT ONLY ARE THE MORE OF THEM

03:28:51.986 --> 03:28:53.921
RELATIVES BUT WE NEED MORE OF

03:28:53.988 --> 03:28:56.190
THEM PERIOD THAN PREVIOUSLY THEY

03:28:56.257 --> 03:28:57.291
HAD.

03:28:57.358 --> 03:28:59.960
AND ARE RFA FUNDING THAT YOU

03:29:00.027 --> 03:29:00.628
THAT THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT

03:29:00.694 --> 03:29:02.296
RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL TO GET

03:29:02.363 --> 03:29:04.298
THEM TO BE APPROVED PLACEMENTS

03:29:04.365 --> 03:29:05.833
IS A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD AND

03:29:05.900 --> 03:29:07.368
THERE'S A BACKLOG THERE.

03:29:07.434 --> 03:29:09.570
AND WE HAVE BEEN ADDING FUNDING

03:29:09.637 --> 03:29:11.338
AS WE GO ALONG TO ADDRESS THE

03:29:11.405 --> 03:29:13.307
NEEDS THAT WE SEE EMERGENCY C.

03:29:13.374 --> 03:29:16.477
R. IMPLEMENTATION CONTINUES OKAY.

03:29:16.543 --> 03:29:19.213
AND THE OTHER GUESTS -- QUESTION

03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:21.348
DOES BROUGHT UP WAS ABOUT -- IN

03:39:18.111 --> 03:39:20.680
IT CETERA AND THEN HOW CLOSE TO

BOARD AT THE UTILIZATION THAT'S

04:20:48.766 --> 04:20:50.134
HAPPENING THE FUNDING THAT'S

04:20:50.201 --> 04:20:51.335
BEING SPENT.

04:20:51.402 --> 04:20:52.036
OUR CLAIMS COMING IN

04:20:57.041 --> 04:20:58.109
THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING SORT OF

04:20:58.175 --> 04:21:00.044
IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT OF OF THE

EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW

04:21:04.849 --> 04:21:06.384
ORGANIZATIONS SIMILAR AGAIN TO

04:21:06.450 --> 04:21:09.787
OUR MANAGED CARE -- STE SIDE --

04:21:09.854 --> 04:21:10.788
TO MEDICAL MISTER SIDES THAT

04:21:10.855 --> 04:21:12.323
GOES OUT AND DOES THINGS ABOUT

04:21:12.390 --> 04:21:14.759
TIMELY ACCESS AND IS NOW ADDING

04:21:14.825 --> 04:21:16.627
THE NETWORK ADEQUACY COMPONENTS --

04:21:16.694 --> 04:21:17.862
AND LOOKING AT QUALITY

04:21:17.928 --> 04:21:19.830
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AND ON TOP

04:21:19.897 --> 04:21:21.298
OF THAT WE JUST SORT OF DO OUR

04:21:21.365 --> 04:21:22.833
NORMAL YOU KNOW LIKE.

04:21:22.900 --> 04:21:24.068
BRENDA AND HER TEAM WORK VERY

04:21:24.135 --> 04:21:25.703
CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES TO TRY

04:21:25.770 --> 04:21:26.804
TO PROVIDE AS MUCH TECHNICAL

04:21:26.871 --> 04:21:28.339
ASSISTANCE AND IDENTIFY WHEN

04:21:28.406 --> 04:21:30.007
THINGS ARE ARE GOING WRONG I

04:21:30.074 --> 04:21:32.510
WOULD SAY -- I THINK AS THE AS

04:21:32.576 --> 04:21:33.811
THE PROGRAM HAS MOVED TO THE

04:21:33.878 --> 04:21:34.345
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

04:21:34.412 --> 04:21:36.781
SERVICES I THINK WE DO HAVE A

04:21:36.847 --> 04:21:38.682
DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN.

04:21:38.749 --> 04:21:40.217
IT WAS HOW IT WAS MANAGED

04:21:40.284 --> 04:21:42.486
PREVIOUSLY -- SO I DO THINK IT'S

04:21:42.553 --> 04:21:44.221
BEEN A CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIP IN

04:21:44.288 --> 04:21:45.890
A CHANGE IN PROCESS AND FOR

04:21:45.956 --> 04:21:48.025
STAFF. TO TO SORT OF SWITCH TO

04:21:48.092 --> 04:21:50.161
MORE MORE MORE OF AN OVERSIGHT

04:21:50.227 --> 04:21:52.229
AND REGULATOR ROLE SIR TRYING TO

04:21:52.296 --> 04:21:54.498
MAKE IT MORE LIKE WHAT WE DO ON

04:21:54.565 --> 04:21:56.067
THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE SIDE SO.

04:21:56.133 --> 04:21:57.401
I THINK WE'RE STILL GETTING

04:21:57.468 --> 04:21:58.002
THEIR THIS WILL BE THE FIRST

04:21:58.069 --> 04:21:59.937
TIME COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS

04:22:00.004 --> 04:22:01.705
HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED -- WITH

04:22:01.772 --> 04:22:03.541
RESPECT TO ANY ASPECT OF OF THE

04:22:03.607 --> 04:22:05.276
CONTRACT AND SO I THINK THAT WE

04:22:05.342 --> 04:22:06.577
ARE STILL.

04:22:06.644 --> 04:22:08.279
BUILDING THAT AT DECISIONAL

04:22:08.345 --> 04:22:10.247
CAPACITY AND SORT OF MAKING SURE

04:22:10.314 --> 04:22:11.182
THAT BOTH OF US.

04:22:11.248 --> 04:22:13.651
BRENDA AND HER TEAM AS WELL AS

04:22:13.717 --> 04:22:14.418
THE COUNTIES AND SEE EACH DAY

04:22:14.485 --> 04:22:15.786
ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW

04:22:15.853 --> 04:22:18.089
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO REALLY.

04:22:18.155 --> 04:22:19.223
MAKE SURE COMPLIANCE IS

04:22:19.290 --> 04:22:25.629
HAPPENING THAT PEOPLE ARE

04:22:25.696 --> 04:22:26.163
GETTING THE SERVICES THAT

04:22:26.230 --> 04:22:28.165
THEY'RE OWED -- AND THAT THAT'S

04:22:28.232 --> 04:22:29.467
HAPPENING VERY CLEARLY AND SO A

04:22:29.533 --> 04:22:30.034
COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT

04:22:30.101 --> 04:22:30.701
WE'VE BEEN DOING BECAUSE ONE OF

04:22:30.768 --> 04:22:31.302
THE CHALLENGES THAT I THINK

04:22:31.368 --> 04:22:31.802
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FACE.

04:22:31.869 --> 04:22:33.037
IS WHEN THERE'S A QUESTION OF

04:22:33.104 --> 04:22:34.171
WHETHER IT IS ESPECIALLY MENTAL

04:22:34.238 --> 04:22:35.739
HEALTH SERVICE OR IS IT A HEALTH

04:22:35.806 --> 04:22:36.740
PLAN SERVICE.

04:22:36.807 --> 04:22:38.309

OBLIGATIONS ARE -- AND TYPICALLY

04:22:58.729 --> 04:23:00.865
IN THOSE CASES IT'S ABOUT A

04:23:00.931 --> 04:23:01.532
FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT SO WE DO SORT

04:23:01.599 --> 04:23:02.800

04:26:23.000 --> 04:26:23.701
EXCITED BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS

04:26:23.767 --> 04:26:25.269
THE WORK OF THAT WERE REALLY

04:26:25.336 --> 04:26:27.538
LOOKING TO BUILD ON WHEN WE HAVE

04:26:27.604 --> 04:26:29.073
THE RENEWAL OF OUR WAIVERS BOTH

04:26:29.139 --> 04:26:30.407

04:26:32.276 --> 04:26:35.045
STARTED THIS WORK LAST YEAR WITH

04:26:35.112 --> 04:26:35.913
A VERY EARLY LOOK I THINK.

04:26:35.979 --> 04:26:37.247
I MAY HAVE TESTIFIED AT SOME

04:26:37.314 --> 04:26:39.450
POINT TO THIS WE HAD A LIKE A

04:26:39.516 --> 04:26:40.951
50% STAKE HOLDER GROUP IT WAS

04:26:41.018 --> 04:26:42.219
ABOUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY ABOUT THE

04:26:42.286 --> 04:26:43.987
FUTURE OF MEDICARE.

04:26:44.054 --> 04:26:46.156
AND SO I TALK ABOUT IT AND MY

04:26:46.223 --> 04:26:48.325
TEAMMATES I WOULD TALK ABOUT IT

04:26:48.392 --> 04:26:50.661
TOO MUCH THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET

04:26:50.728 --> 04:26:57.301
ANNOYED BUT THEY THINK THAT.

04:26:57.368 --> 04:26:57.935
THEY'RE TRYING TO COME OVER LAST

04:26:58.001 --> 04:26:59.470

AS LIKE A FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS

04:27:00.471 --> 04:27:01.038
LIKE REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW

04:27:01.105 --> 04:27:02.039
DO WE WANT THE PROGRAM TO LOOK

04:27:02.106 --> 04:27:02.706
AND THAT SPECIFICALLY ALSO HAS A

04:27:02.773 --> 04:27:03.307
GOAL OF AROUND INTEGRATION AND

04:27:03.374 --> 04:27:04.241
MAKING SURE THAT.

04:27:04.308 --> 04:27:05.843
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO

04:27:05.909 --> 04:27:07.344
ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED

04:27:07.411 --> 04:27:08.579
AND NOT JUST THE HEALTH SERVICES

04:27:08.645 --> 04:27:10.214

04:27:10.280 --> 04:27:11.014
DOING A LOT OF STUFF WITH THE

04:27:11.081 --> 04:27:12.316
WHOLE PERSON CARE TO TRY TO

04:27:12.383 --> 04:27:13.550
REALLY GET THE OTHER SORT OF

04:27:13.617 --> 04:27:14.618
SOCIAL.

SPECIFICALLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH

04:27:17.821 --> 04:27:20.057
AND SUBSTANCE USE HOW DO WE MAKE

04:27:20.124 --> 04:27:21.925
IT A MUCH EASIER SYSTEM FOR

04:27:21.992 --> 04:27:23.627
PEOPLE I MEAN I SO I TALK ABOUT

04:27:23.694 --> 04:27:24.762

PEOPLE MAY HAVE TO ACCESS

04:27:25.662 --> 04:27:27.197
SERVICES IN FIVE DIFFERENT

04:27:27.264 --> 04:27:28.699
SYSTEMS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM

04:27:28.766 --> 04:27:30.267
THAT'S THAT'S NOT HOW WE WOULD

04:27:30.334 --> 04:27:31.568
HAVE BUILT IT TODAY IF IT WAS

04:27:31.635 --> 04:27:33.437
BEING BUILT TODAY SO WHAT SHOULD

04:27:33.504 --> 04:27:35.372
IT LOOK LIKE IT THIS IS WHERE.

04:27:35.439 --> 04:27:37.708
IT COMES TO THE FIVE AND TEN AND

04:27:37.775 --> 04:27:39.810
FIFTEEN BECAUSE MAYBE

04:27:39.877 --> 04:27:40.444
SOMETHING'S WILL TAKE LONGER BUT

FINANCING REASONS TO DELIVERY

04:27:50.154 --> 04:27:51.221
SYSTEM REASONS.

04:27:51.288 --> 04:27:52.890

04:31:38.415 --> 04:31:40.517
ELIGIBLES AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO

04:31:40.584 --> 04:31:41.752
MAKE THAT CHANGE SO.

04:31:41.818 --> 04:31:43.253
TRYING TO COMPETE DO COMPARISONS

04:31:43.320 --> 04:31:44.588

BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE AS WE DO

04:32:04.541 --> 04:32:05.642

AB FIVE OH ONE THE QUESTION OF

05:05:42.290 --> 05:05:44.759
WE WERE LOOKING AT WHAT TYPE OF

05:05:44.826 --> 05:05:46.661

05:05:46.728 --> 05:05:49.964
EFFECTIVELY -- THE S. T. R. T.

05:05:50.031 --> 05:05:51.700
P. LICENSURE WAS THE MOST

05:05:51.766 --> 05:05:53.735
COMPATIBLE WITH THE C. C. R. P.

05:05:53.802 --> 05:05:54.936
MODEL.

05:05:55.003 --> 05:05:56.838

CATEGORY THAT WAS AGREED UPON.

05:05:59.808 --> 05:06:01.943
THIS IS CREATED CONFUSION. TO

WRAP UP SENT UP.

05:06:05.046 --> 05:06:06.648
BECAUSE THE C. C. R. P. IS A NOT

A FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT.

05:06:07.415 --> 05:06:09.017
IT IS CLEARLY A PSYCHIATRIC

05:06:24.933 --> 05:06:26.434
THE ISSUE AT HAND TODAY IS THE

05:06:26.501 --> 05:06:29.370
BILL IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES

05:06:29.437 --> 05:06:31.072

05:08:49.844 --> 05:08:51.079
A RECENT SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERS

YEAR ON THESE PROGRAMS.

05:08:56.651 --> 05:08:57.952

THAT WELL AS THE COURT OFFICE

05:09:11.199 --> 05:09:12.600
OFTEN OFTEN DICTATES EXACTLY

05:09:12.667 --> 05:09:14.168
WHAT WE HAVE TO TAKE.

05:09:14.235 --> 05:09:15.937
BASED ON LEGISLATIVE MANDATES

05:09:16.004 --> 05:09:16.871

GROWN 30% IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS

05:09:22.610 --> 05:09:24.245
THIS 30% INCREASE OF CASES IS

05:09:24.312 --> 05:09:26.581
DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE LAWS AND

05:09:26.648 --> 05:09:26.848

QUESTIONS I HAD BEEN ANALYST

05:11:13.621 --> 05:11:14.455
FINANCE EARLIER MIGHT WANT TO

05:11:14.522 --> 05:11:17.825
ANSWER THIS ONE IS IS THAT -- IS

05:11:17.892 --> 05:11:19.894
MENTIONED THAT -- YOU KNOW.

05:11:19.961 --> 05:11:22.530
WE THROUGH THE STATE LEGISLATURE

05:11:22.597 --> 05:11:24.198
GOVERNOR'S AYE IT THAT HAVE HAVE

05:11:24.265 --> 05:11:26.834
INCREASED THE WORKLOAD.

05:11:26.901 --> 05:11:33.875
A CONSERVATIVE OR I THOUGHT.

05:11:33.941 --> 05:11:35.243
IT IS YOURS GUARDIANS COULD

05:11:35.309 --> 05:11:42.417
SERVICE -- SO -- SO -- THAT

05:11:42.483 --> 05:11:43.751
DOESN'T ADD DAY DISSIDENT

05:11:43.818 --> 05:11:49.824
TRIGGER A STATE NEED TO PUT CHEN.

05:11:49.891 --> 05:11:51.225
TELL ANYTHING THE THOUGHTS ON

05:11:51.292 --> 05:11:54.629
THAT OUT OF THE HISTORY OF WHAT

05:11:54.695 --> 05:11:55.963
WHOSE WAS TO DO WHAT SO YES.

05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:56.664
YEAH I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY

05:11:56.731 --> 05:11:58.066
COMMENTS I WOULD I'D BE CURIOUS

05:11:58.132 --> 05:12:01.536
TO SEE THE DATA AND TO TO KNOW

05:12:01.602 --> 05:12:03.104
LIKE WHAT WORKLOAD WAS INCREASE

05:12:03.171 --> 05:12:04.338
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK

05:12:04.405 --> 05:12:06.040
WHEN THERE ARE INCREASED COSTS

05:12:06.107 --> 05:12:07.775
THAT RESULT IN STATE MANDATES.

05:12:07.842 --> 05:12:08.810
YOU KNOW THEIR CONVERSATIONS

05:12:08.876 --> 05:12:10.778
WITH WITH THE ENTITY THAT COUNTY

05:12:10.845 --> 05:12:12.513
SAID. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

05:12:12.580 --> 05:12:15.149
AND IF THEY'RE LEFT AND UNFUNDED

05:12:15.216 --> 05:12:17.218
THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW PROCESS

05:12:17.285 --> 05:12:18.186
THAT.

05:12:18.252 --> 05:12:20.621
COUNTIES CAN FILE STATE MANDATE

05:12:20.688 --> 05:12:22.290
CLAIMS.

05:12:22.356 --> 05:12:23.291
BUT I MEAN THOSE ARE

05:12:23.357 --> 05:12:24.225
CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE

05:12:24.292 --> 05:12:25.793
HAD IN LIKE.

05:12:25.860 --> 05:12:27.995
YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I MEAN

05:12:28.062 --> 05:12:29.697
IT I MEAN WHEN ONE ROUTE WOULD

05:12:29.764 --> 05:12:30.465
BE TO GO TO MANDATE COMMISSION

05:12:30.531 --> 05:12:31.432
SAY BY THE WAY YOU KNOW IT'S AT

05:12:31.499 --> 05:12:33.067
BUT I THINK THE OTHER PRO YEAH

05:12:33.134 --> 05:12:33.668
YEAH I GUESS I GUESS RIGHT WE

05:12:33.734 --> 05:12:35.603
TRIED THAT WE WENT TO THE STATE

05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.870
MANDATE.

05:12:35.937 --> 05:12:38.072
COMMISSION AND AND AND MADE A

05:12:38.139 --> 05:12:40.508
CASE THEY DENIED IT BECAUSE THE

05:12:40.575 --> 05:12:42.877
LAW IT'S IT'S CONTRADICTORY SO

05:12:42.944 --> 05:12:44.445
THE LAW SAYS THAT THE COUNTY

05:12:44.512 --> 05:12:46.114
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC

05:12:46.180 --> 05:12:47.115
GUARDIAN.

05:12:47.181 --> 05:12:48.616
BUT AT THE COUNTY CHOOSES TO

05:12:48.683 --> 05:12:50.017
HAVE APUBLIC GUARDIAN THEN WE

05:12:50.084 --> 05:12:51.119
MANDATE THAT YOU DO ALL THESE

05:12:51.185 --> 05:12:53.221
THINGS BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT

05:12:53.287 --> 05:12:55.490
THAT SHIP SAILED A LONG TIME AGO

05:12:55.556 --> 05:12:56.791
LIKE FORTY YEARS AGO THE

05:12:56.858 --> 05:12:58.392
COUNTIES CREATED PUBLIC

05:12:58.459 --> 05:12:59.227
GUARDIANS.

05:12:59.293 --> 05:13:00.628
AND NOW PUBLIC GUARDING

05:13:00.695 --> 05:13:02.563
CONSERVATIVES ARE RESPONSIBLE

05:13:02.630 --> 05:13:04.298
FOR ALL THESE CASES THE COURT IS

05:13:04.365 --> 05:13:06.367
NOT GOING TO ALLOW US TO WALK

05:13:06.434 --> 05:13:07.935
AWAY WE DON'T HAVE THAT

05:13:08.002 --> 05:13:09.570
DISCRETION AT THIS POINT TO WALK

05:13:09.637 --> 05:13:10.471
AWAY.

05:13:10.538 --> 05:13:13.040
SO WE WERE CAUGHT IN A IN A

05:13:13.107 --> 05:13:14.242
DOUBLE BIND.

05:13:14.308 --> 05:13:20.148
THE STATE MANDATES SAID I'M NOT

05:13:20.214 --> 05:13:21.315
IT'S NOT YOU PERSONALLY -- STATE

05:13:21.382 --> 05:13:21.849
MANDATE SAID NO YOU DON'T

05:13:21.916 --> 05:13:23.184
QUALIFY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE

05:13:23.251 --> 05:13:23.651
TO HAVE THIS.

05:13:23.718 --> 05:13:25.086
BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE IT

05:13:25.153 --> 05:13:26.621
BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY HAS GOTTEN

05:13:26.687 --> 05:13:30.324
TO A POINT WHERE IT IS REQUIRED.

05:13:30.391 --> 05:13:32.527
SO WE WERE WE WERE NOT ELIGIBLE.

05:13:32.593 --> 05:13:34.028
DIMMING FOR TO COME RIGHT NOW IT

05:13:34.095 --> 05:13:35.163
WOULD JUST SAY THAT I I THINK.

05:13:35.229 --> 05:13:36.164
DEFINITELY WHEN THERE'S LAWS

05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:38.499
PASSED A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY

05:13:38.566 --> 05:13:41.502
THEY SAY THE COUNTIES MAY.

05:13:41.569 --> 05:13:44.872
RATHER THAN SHALL AND SO WHAT

05:13:44.939 --> 05:13:45.540
WITH IT MOST OF THE SELECTION OF

05:13:45.606 --> 05:13:47.975
THE COUNTY AND WHETHER NOT THEY

05:13:48.042 --> 05:13:49.243
WANT TO DO THAT OKAY WELL AS A

05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:50.144
LIST OF THE SITE.

05:13:50.211 --> 05:13:54.882
SO I MEAN WE CAN.

05:13:54.949 --> 05:13:56.884
WE CAN.

05:13:56.951 --> 05:13:59.420
WEEK AS I'M NOT A LAWYER SO WE

05:13:59.487 --> 05:14:01.455
COULD NOT TAKE THE LAW -- BUT I

05:14:01.522 --> 05:14:03.758
THINK SO SO MAYBE LEGALLY NOT

05:14:03.824 --> 05:14:05.826
MANDATED BUT I I I I DO WONDER

05:14:05.893 --> 05:14:09.230
ABOUT -- THE STATE'S

05:14:09.297 --> 05:14:09.830
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE SOME

05:14:09.897 --> 05:14:11.098
FUNDING.

05:14:11.165 --> 05:14:12.667
BECAUSE OF WHAT WORK WE'VE

05:14:12.733 --> 05:14:14.502
REQUIRED SO I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT

05:14:14.569 --> 05:14:16.170
STRICTLY YOU KNOW.

05:14:16.237 --> 05:14:17.305

THAT CENTRO THE WE CAN DEBATE

05:14:22.710 --> 05:14:23.644
ARGUE BUT I'M JUST SAYING

05:14:23.711 --> 05:14:25.279
CONCEPTUALLY.

05:14:25.346 --> 05:14:25.880
SOMETIMES ON A SAY WELL YOU

ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS OKAY I HAVE

05:14:37.625 --> 05:14:39.160
TO SAY BUT IT SOUNDS AS IF THE

05:14:39.227 --> 05:14:41.929
STATE CURRENTLY DOES NOT PROVIDE

05:14:41.996 --> 05:14:42.663
ANY DIRECT FUNDING FOR THAT

05:14:42.730 --> 05:14:44.465
RIGHT SO OKAY WELL I THINK I

THIS IS PART OF A LARGER EFFORT

05:28:10.837 --> 05:28:12.406
THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING.

05:28:12.472 --> 05:28:13.774
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW THE

05:28:13.840 --> 05:28:15.642
PUBLIC TO SEE THE DOLLARS THAT

05:28:15.709 --> 05:28:17.544
ARE AVAILABLE THE PROGRAMS THAT

05:28:17.611 --> 05:28:19.212
ARE FUNDED WITH THOSE DOLLARS

05:28:19.279 --> 05:28:19.846
AND THEN THE HARD PART IS THE

05:28:19.913 --> 05:28:20.814
OUTCOMES.

05:28:20.881 --> 05:28:22.349
THE INTENT OF THIS WORK IS TO

05:28:22.416 --> 05:28:23.750
ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY

05:28:23.817 --> 05:28:25.085
PLANNING PROCESS THAT IS

05:28:25.152 --> 05:28:26.086
REQUIRED IN THE MIDDLE HOW

05:28:26.153 --> 05:28:27.120
SERVICES ACT.

05:28:27.187 --> 05:28:28.655
THE IDEA IS THAT SOMEONE FROM

05:28:28.722 --> 05:28:29.856
THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE ABLE TO

05:28:29.923 --> 05:28:31.792
WALK INTO THAT PROCESS AND HAVE

05:28:31.858 --> 05:28:33.727
THE BASICS IN BASIC INFORMATION

05:28:33.794 --> 05:28:35.162
AT THEIR FINGERTIPS TO REALLY

05:28:35.228 --> 05:28:36.930
ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR

05:28:36.997 --> 05:28:39.599
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

05:28:39.666 --> 05:28:40.734
AND HOW WELL IT'S WORKING.

05:28:40.801 --> 05:28:41.301
WE THINK THIS WORK IS HIGHLY

05:28:41.368 --> 05:28:43.603
EFFECTIVE -- THE STATE'S HISTORY

05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:44.671
IN THE COUNTY HISTORY IN TERMS

05:28:44.738 --> 05:28:47.240
OF REPORTING WAS NOT GREAT BUT

05:28:47.307 --> 05:28:48.575
AS WE RELEASE THESE THESE

05:28:48.642 --> 05:28:50.243
FIGURES AND CREATED PUBLIC

05:28:50.310 --> 05:28:51.978
AWARENESS IT IT CREATED

05:28:52.045 --> 05:28:53.680
ATTENTION ON THE PROBLEM AND THE

05:28:53.747 --> 05:28:54.581
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY

05:28:54.648 --> 05:28:55.649
RESPONSIVE AND COUNTY SOME VERY

05:28:55.715 --> 05:28:56.917
RESPONSIVE.

05:28:56.983 --> 05:28:58.585
THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS THAT

05:28:58.652 --> 05:29:00.387
UNDER THE TERMS OF AB ONE

05:29:00.454 --> 05:29:01.388
FOURTEEN AS THE DEPARTMENT HAS

05:29:01.455 --> 05:29:04.091
BEGUN TO GO BACK TO TWO THOUSAND

05:29:04.157 --> 05:29:06.526
AND FOUR TO RECONCILE.

05:29:06.593 --> 05:29:08.695
RECEIPTS REVENUES SPENDING IN

05:29:08.762 --> 05:29:10.564
UNSPENT FUNDS THAN WHAT WE'RE

05:29:10.630 --> 05:29:11.465
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

05:29:11.531 --> 05:29:13.366
NUMBERS THE DEPARTMENT HAS DON'T

05:29:13.433 --> 05:29:14.868
MATCH WITH THE NUMBERS THAT

05:29:14.935 --> 05:29:16.303
WE'VE BEEN RELYING ON WHICH OF

05:29:16.369 --> 05:29:17.804
THE COUNTY ARE YEAH OURS WHICH

05:29:17.871 --> 05:29:19.673
ARE CERTIFIED BY THE INDEPENDENT

05:29:19.739 --> 05:29:21.074
AUDITOR CONTROLLERS.

05:29:21.141 --> 05:29:23.510
SO WE ARE WE'VE RAISED THE ISSUE

05:29:23.577 --> 05:29:24.611
WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVEN'T

05:29:24.678 --> 05:29:25.846
SAT DOWN YET BUT I THINK THERE'S

05:29:25.912 --> 05:29:27.114
A COMMITMENT TO SIT DOWN AND

05:29:27.180 --> 05:29:29.082
FIGURE THAT OUT.

05:29:29.149 --> 05:29:30.584
OUR CONCERN IS THAT.

05:29:30.650 --> 05:29:32.986
IT BY LINKING THIS DATA TO A

05:29:33.053 --> 05:29:34.654
THIRD PARTY CERTIFIED REPORT

05:29:34.721 --> 05:29:36.556
FROM THE COUNTIES WE HAVE A HIGH

05:29:36.623 --> 05:29:38.425
DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE

05:29:38.492 --> 05:29:39.659
DAY THAT THE ORIGINAL DATA

05:29:39.726 --> 05:29:40.627
SOURCES GOOD.

05:29:40.694 --> 05:29:42.362
OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT BECAUSE

05:29:42.429 --> 05:29:46.333
OF CHANGES IN THE WAY IN WHICH

05:29:46.399 --> 05:29:46.766
THE DEPARTMENT HAS.

05:29:46.833 --> 05:29:47.801
COUNTING EXPENDITURES AND

05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:49.636
REVENUES BY YEAR THAT THE

05:29:49.703 --> 05:29:50.937
NUMBERS DON'T MATCH.

05:29:51.004 --> 05:29:51.938
AND WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE

05:29:52.005 --> 05:29:54.174
CONFUSION ON THE PART OF FOR

05:29:54.241 --> 05:29:56.676
EXAMPLE -- COUNTY SUPERVISORS

05:29:56.743 --> 05:29:57.944
WHO ARE LOOKING AT THEIR OWN

05:29:58.011 --> 05:29:59.679
COUNTIES NUMBERS AND COMPARING

05:29:59.746 --> 05:30:00.680
THEM TO THE STATE'S NUMBERS AND

05:30:00.747 --> 05:30:02.549
THEY DON'T LINE UP AND SO SO

05:30:02.616 --> 05:30:04.417
WHAT WE'VE RAISED WITH SAFF AND

05:30:04.484 --> 05:30:05.485
WE DAM OUT.

05:30:05.552 --> 05:30:06.720
ALL OF THESE TOOLS WITH STAFF

05:30:06.786 --> 05:30:07.888
WITH YOUR STAFF.

05:30:07.954 --> 05:30:09.089
IS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

05:30:09.156 --> 05:30:10.090
SIT DOWN.

05:30:10.157 --> 05:30:12.025
AND DEVELOP A AN AGREED UPON

05:30:12.092 --> 05:30:13.593
UNIFORMS STRATEGY FOR COUNTY

05:30:13.660 --> 05:30:15.962
REPORTING AND STATE REPORTING SO

05:30:16.029 --> 05:30:17.230
WE HAVE A SINGLE SET OF NUMBERS

05:30:17.297 --> 05:30:18.698
THAT ARE VALID AND RELIABLE.

05:30:18.765 --> 05:30:20.133
THAT WORK HASN'T BEEN DONE YET

05:30:20.200 --> 05:30:21.935
BECAUSE THE THE FISCAL RAGS ARE

05:30:22.002 --> 05:30:24.337
NEW BECAUSE THE CHANGE AND IN

05:30:24.404 --> 05:30:26.840
THE ACCOUNTING APPROACH HAS JUST

05:30:26.907 --> 05:30:27.874
HAPPENED BUT IT BUT WE'VE WE'VE

05:30:27.941 --> 05:30:29.075
BEEN HIGHLIGHT THAT AS A

05:30:29.142 --> 05:30:30.143
CHALLENGE.

05:30:30.210 --> 05:30:31.878
IF THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE

05:30:31.945 --> 05:30:33.680
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND UPDATE

05:30:33.747 --> 05:30:35.615
THE FISCAL REPORTS IF WE WERE TO

05:30:35.682 --> 05:30:37.417
DO THAT NOW FOR EXAMPLE WITH

05:30:37.484 --> 05:30:38.852
COUNTY DRIVEN REPORTS WE WOULD

05:30:38.919 --> 05:30:40.020
SEE THAT IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY

05:30:40.086 --> 05:30:42.489
MATCH ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY

05:30:42.556 --> 05:30:43.657
BASIS WITH THE STATE'S NUMBERS.

05:30:43.723 --> 05:30:46.826
WE THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM.

05:30:46.893 --> 05:30:47.561
CERTAINLY CAN CAUSE A LOT OF

05:30:47.627 --> 05:30:48.461
CONFUSION.

05:30:48.528 --> 05:30:50.797
ABSOLUTELY UP COSTS DID YOU HAVE

05:30:50.864 --> 05:30:52.032
MORE TO SAY [inaudible]

05:30:52.098 --> 05:30:53.934
OKAY.

05:30:54.000 --> 05:30:55.168
EDWARD WE ARE COMMITTED TO

05:30:55.235 --> 05:30:57.037
SITTING DOWN WITH THE AC AND AND

05:30:57.103 --> 05:30:58.371
FIGURING THAT OUT BUT ARE YOURS

05:30:58.438 --> 05:31:00.273
ARE BASICALLY LIKE COSTS REPORTS

05:31:00.340 --> 05:31:02.075
AND SO WOW WHAT GETS SUBMITTED

05:31:02.142 --> 05:31:03.677
AND CERTIFIED CAN CHANGE

05:31:03.743 --> 05:31:04.945
AFTERWARDS BECAUSE COUNTIES MAKE

05:31:05.011 --> 05:31:07.714
UPDATE SO -- SO EVEN YOU KNOW

05:31:07.781 --> 05:31:09.749
THE METHODOLOGY IS LIKE -- YOU

05:31:09.816 --> 05:31:10.917
KNOW IN A DIRECTORY EWING SAID

05:31:10.984 --> 05:31:13.286
THAT -- METHODOLOGIES CAN CHANGE

05:31:13.353 --> 05:31:15.388
OVER TIME -- SO CAN THE NUMBERS

05:31:15.455 --> 05:31:16.656
THAT THE COUNTY IS -- SUBMIT

05:31:16.723 --> 05:31:17.691
BASED ON YOU KNOW JUST CALL

05:31:17.757 --> 05:31:19.893
CORRECTIONS OF INACCURACIES AND

05:31:19.960 --> 05:31:20.560
SUCH SO I THINK WE JUST NEED TO

05:31:20.627 --> 05:31:22.229
SIT DOWN AND KIND OF WORK IT OUT

05:31:22.295 --> 05:31:23.430
TOGETHER AND JUST MAKE SURE.

05:31:23.496 --> 05:31:24.764
THAT -- THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A

05:31:24.831 --> 05:31:25.498
WAY TO MAKE THAT SURE THE

05:31:25.565 --> 05:31:29.402
NUMBERS LINE UP SO WE HAVE SOME

05:31:29.469 --> 05:31:31.871
IDEAS FOR THAT AND WE'RE GONNA.

05:31:31.938 --> 05:31:33.907
WE'RE ALL WORKING HARD WORK IT

05:31:33.974 --> 05:31:36.509
OUT OKAY ALL RIGHT HELLO I WAS

05:31:36.576 --> 05:31:38.878
MILLION THE NO ALL RIGHT.

05:31:38.945 --> 05:31:39.646
FINANCE [inaudible]

05:31:39.713 --> 05:31:41.915
MEMBERS.

05:31:41.982 --> 05:31:45.018
OKAY SO I AM.

05:31:45.085 --> 05:31:50.023
YEAH I'M AND I THINK THAT -- YOU

05:31:50.090 --> 05:31:51.458
KNOW WHAT ONE OF THINGS THAT

05:31:51.524 --> 05:31:52.626
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NO ONE THE

05:31:52.692 --> 05:31:54.628
AUDITOR'S REPORT CAME OUT AS

05:31:54.694 --> 05:31:56.029
DURING SUBCOMMITTEE AND WE

05:31:56.096 --> 05:31:57.530
COULDN'T FIGURE I RECONCILE WE

05:31:57.597 --> 05:31:59.065
HEARD DTS NEVER BOTHER TRACKING

05:31:59.132 --> 05:32:00.900
THE NUMBERS SO -- BECAUSE AND

05:32:00.967 --> 05:32:02.502
THEY INITIATIVE IT SAYS THAT YOU

05:32:02.569 --> 05:32:05.538
DON'T SPEND THE MONEY IT COMES

05:32:05.605 --> 05:32:06.706
BACK.

05:32:06.773 --> 05:32:08.241
AS LIKEWELL WE DON'T KNOW

05:32:08.308 --> 05:32:08.908
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TRACK WHATEVER

05:32:08.975 --> 05:32:10.010
I MEAN THAT THAT I THINK THAT

05:32:10.076 --> 05:32:13.513
WAS -- I THINK THAT LED TO A

05:32:13.580 --> 05:32:15.315
TREMENDOUS LOSS OF CONFIDENCE

05:32:15.382 --> 05:32:20.820
AND AND SO -- AND AND I THINK IT

05:32:20.887 --> 05:32:23.023
WENT WELL -- I THINK ONE OF THE

05:32:23.089 --> 05:32:25.659
THINGS IS THAT -- WE NEED TO BE

05:32:25.725 --> 05:32:26.993
SURE BECAUSE MOST OF THE SITE

05:32:27.060 --> 05:32:28.428
AND THE SERVE TIES A LITTLE BIT

05:32:28.495 --> 05:32:29.796
TO SOME OF MY QUESTIONS AND THE

05:32:29.863 --> 05:32:31.531
BEGINNING OF AROUND WHAT WE'RE

05:32:31.598 --> 05:32:34.234
TALKING ABOUT A HEALTH OVERALL

05:32:34.301 --> 05:32:36.436
IS THAT.

05:32:36.503 --> 05:32:37.237
WHAT WE SAW THIS EVEN POLLING

05:32:37.304 --> 05:32:38.705
SHOWS THAT MENTAL HEALTH LIKE

05:32:38.772 --> 05:32:40.674
HEALTH CARE'S PRETTY MUCH ON TOP

05:32:40.740 --> 05:32:42.142
RIGHT -- OF OF OF OF

05:32:42.208 --> 05:32:43.209
CALIFORNIANS MIND AND AND

05:32:43.276 --> 05:32:45.245
ACTUALLY MENTAL HEALTH AS FAR AS

05:32:45.312 --> 05:32:46.713
HEALTH CARE DATE.

05:32:46.780 --> 05:32:47.347
AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT LAW MY

05:32:47.414 --> 05:32:48.782
COLLEAGUES LIKE WE NEED TO DO

05:32:48.848 --> 05:32:50.216
SOMETHING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH

05:32:50.283 --> 05:32:52.052
RIGHT AND THERE'S BY DIFFERENT

05:32:52.118 --> 05:32:53.119
BUILDINGS SO FORTH.

05:32:53.186 --> 05:32:54.954
ETCETERA BUT I THINK THERE'S

05:32:55.021 --> 05:32:56.256
ALSO AYE FEEL THERE'S

05:32:56.323 --> 05:32:59.059
FRUSTRATION THAT THE FROM PEOPLE

05:32:59.125 --> 05:33:00.360
EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE FAIRLY

05:33:00.427 --> 05:33:04.831
INVOLVED IN MENTAL HEALTH -- THE

05:33:04.898 --> 05:33:06.566
THAT.

05:33:06.633 --> 05:33:07.767
WE DON'T REALLYKNOW WHAT'S.

05:33:07.834 --> 05:33:09.035
GOING ON RIGHT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S

05:33:09.102 --> 05:33:09.936
ALL IT'S LIKE WELL EACH COUNTIES

05:33:10.003 --> 05:33:11.104
DOING THEIR OWN THING AND SO

05:33:11.171 --> 05:33:12.639
FORTH AND SOME OF ITS TO THE WAY

05:33:12.706 --> 05:33:13.673
WE STRUCTURED NOW THE THE

05:33:13.740 --> 05:33:16.843
PROPOSITION SO FORTH BUT ALSO

05:33:16.910 --> 05:33:17.243
THAT WE DID IT IT.

05:33:17.310 --> 05:33:19.713
IT SEEMS.

05:33:19.779 --> 05:33:20.347
I THINK PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

05:33:20.413 --> 05:33:20.947
NOT THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY

05:33:21.014 --> 05:33:22.849
GETTING ACTION INFORMATION --

05:33:22.916 --> 05:33:23.950
THE OUT IT SEEMED INDICATE THAT

05:33:24.017 --> 05:33:25.652
PEOPLE REALLY FIND RULES A START

05:33:25.719 --> 05:33:28.288
WITH YOU KNOW SECOND COUNTY

05:33:28.355 --> 05:33:28.922
FOUND OUT THE COUNTY OF SITTING

05:33:28.988 --> 05:33:29.956
IN A WHOLE.

05:33:30.023 --> 05:33:31.291
BUNCH OF MONEY AND THAT WAS ON

05:33:31.358 --> 05:33:32.459
THE ONLY OTHER COUNTY IN

05:33:32.525 --> 05:33:33.293
MEANTIME OR SAY WHAT WE HAVE

05:33:33.360 --> 05:33:35.462

NATION TO SELL PROPERTY THE

05:33:36.663 --> 05:33:38.398
THREE GIVE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR

05:33:38.465 --> 05:33:39.766
US TO DO ALL THE STUFF AND WE

05:33:39.833 --> 05:33:40.633
CERTAINLY SEE THE NEED.

05:33:40.700 --> 05:33:41.835
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME WHAT

05:33:41.901 --> 05:33:43.737
SPENDING THE MONEY AND WHAT'S

05:33:43.803 --> 05:33:44.938
GOING ON THERE RIGHT.

05:33:45.004 --> 05:33:47.874
AND SO IT AND AND THEY'LL LIVE

05:33:47.941 --> 05:33:49.409
WHILE CERTAINLY NOT THIS YEAR

05:33:49.476 --> 05:33:50.910
BUT YOU KNOW NOT SO MANY YEARS

05:33:50.977 --> 05:33:53.913
AGO PEOPLE START SAYING WELL YOU

05:33:53.980 --> 05:33:56.049
KNOW IS.

05:33:56.116 --> 05:33:57.884
THAT THAT DON'T DO WE STILL NEED

05:33:57.951 --> 05:33:59.219
THIS NOT THAT WE DON'T NEED THE

05:33:59.285 --> 05:34:00.520
RESOURCES BUT IS THIS NOW THIS

05:34:00.587 --> 05:34:02.489
IS ALREADY WORKING RIGHT.

05:34:02.555 --> 05:34:05.392
AND AND THERE ARE SOME CERTAINLY

05:34:05.458 --> 05:34:06.826
SOME I THINK SOME SOME SOMETIMES

05:34:06.893 --> 05:34:08.962
UNWARRANTED CRITICISM ABOUT WHAT

05:34:09.028 --> 05:34:10.230
THEY DID FIND OUT WAS BEING

05:34:10.296 --> 05:34:10.764
SPENT.

05:34:10.830 --> 05:34:12.165
I THINK SOMETIMES YOU ON VALUE

05:34:12.232 --> 05:34:14.768
PREVENTION TYPE ACTIVITIES AND

THAT'S WHY TALK ABOUT LIKE

05:34:23.443 --> 05:34:25.211
THINGS LIKE STATEWIDE GOALS AND

05:34:25.278 --> 05:34:27.881

LOTS OF DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND I

05:34:32.786 --> 05:34:34.154
CAN A TAKE OFF SEVERAL OF THEM

05:34:34.220 --> 05:34:35.155
BUT THE SAME TIME IT.

05:34:35.221 --> 05:34:35.889
PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE NEEDLE

05:34:35.955 --> 05:34:37.924
NESTLE MOVING AS MUCH AS THEY

HEALTH OKAY I'VE DONE MY

05:34:51.304 --> 05:34:52.439

THE OPIOID CRISIS AT A WHOLE

05:35:00.313 --> 05:35:01.948

YEAH WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT

05:35:06.252 --> 05:35:06.786
PARTS AND IT SEEMS HARD TO

EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE ALL THIS IS

05:35:07.987 --> 05:35:14.194
ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT

05:35:14.260 --> 05:35:18.998

05:35:19.065 --> 05:35:19.933
HOPING THAT SO PART OF PART OF

05:35:19.999 --> 05:35:20.700
ITS SMALL THINGS LIKE

05:35:20.767 --> 05:35:21.801
RECONCILING NUMBERS AND PART OF

05:35:21.868 --> 05:35:23.770
IT IS ALSO -- YOU KNOW AND THIS

05:35:23.837 --> 05:35:24.504
IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW CERTAINLY

THINK WE DO WE NEED TO NEED TO

05:35:28.408 --> 05:35:29.709
THINK OF SOME KIND OF BETTER

05:35:29.776 --> 05:35:31.978
STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK THAT'S MORE.

05:35:32.045 --> 05:35:33.446
EXPLAINABLE I GUESS AS MORE

05:35:33.513 --> 05:35:35.181
COMMUNICATIONS VALUE TO THE

05:35:35.248 --> 05:35:37.517
PUBLIC THAT SHOWS THAT WE'RE

05:35:37.584 --> 05:35:38.618
ACTUALLY MOVING THE NEEDLE.

05:35:38.685 --> 05:35:41.688
AND HOPING WE CAN TRY TO GET

05:35:41.754 --> 05:35:41.888
THERE.

05:35:41.955 --> 05:35:47.327
HELLO MY THE CELL DAVID TELL ME

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YEAH AND

I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE

05:35:52.165 --> 05:35:54.133
COMMISSION IS COMING FROM AND

05:35:54.200 --> 05:35:56.336
PART OF THIS EFFORT AROUND BEING

05:35:56.402 --> 05:35:58.104
ABLE TO CREATE VERY EASILY

05:35:58.171 --> 05:35:59.906
ACCESSIBLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE

05:35:59.973 --> 05:36:01.407
INFORMATION ON THE DOLLARS THE

05:36:01.474 --> 05:36:02.842
PROGRAMS AND THE OUTCOMES IN THE

05:36:02.909 --> 05:36:04.043
OUTCOME IS THE IS THE IMPORTANT

05:36:04.110 --> 05:36:04.978
PIECE.

05:36:05.044 --> 05:36:06.346
IS THAT IS OUR DEFINITION OF

05:36:06.412 --> 05:36:08.381
PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY PUBLIC

05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:10.483
OVERSIGHT -- IS THAT HOW CAN THE

05:36:10.550 --> 05:36:12.118
STATE THROUGH THE WORK THAT

05:36:12.185 --> 05:36:13.953
WE'RE DOING REALLY HELP THE

05:36:14.020 --> 05:36:15.755
PUBLIC UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS

05:36:15.822 --> 05:36:16.923
THAT ARE BEING BEING MADE.

05:36:16.990 --> 05:36:18.925
AND WHAT WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE

05:36:18.992 --> 05:36:20.894
THE OUTCOME WORK IS THE MOST

05:36:20.960 --> 05:36:22.095
DIFFICULT WORK -- WE'VE BEEN

05:36:22.161 --> 05:36:26.466
ABLE TO DO SOME ANALYSIS OF FULL

05:36:26.533 --> 05:36:28.001
SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS.

05:36:28.067 --> 05:36:29.636
pOUTCOMES BUT OVERALL THE DATA

05:36:29.702 --> 05:36:32.171
EXPRESS A LOT OF CHALLENGE AND

05:36:32.238 --> 05:36:33.540
PART OF THAT CONVERSATION IS.

05:36:33.606 --> 05:36:35.341
AS WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

05:36:35.408 --> 05:36:37.310
THERE ARE CHALLENGES WHAT ROLE

05:36:37.377 --> 05:36:39.012
DOES THE STATE HAVE OR CAN HAVE

05:36:39.078 --> 05:36:40.280
TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY COUNTIES

05:36:40.346 --> 05:36:41.281
TO IMPROVE.

05:36:41.347 --> 05:36:42.282
AND IN SO PART OF THE

05:36:42.348 --> 05:36:43.116
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN

05:36:43.182 --> 05:36:44.517
HAVING INTERNALLY ARE WHAT ARE

05:36:44.584 --> 05:36:45.752
THE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN

05:36:45.818 --> 05:36:47.487
INCENTIVIZE AN INFLUENCE AND

05:36:47.554 --> 05:36:48.354
SHAPE.

05:36:48.421 --> 05:36:49.789
IN IN WAYS THAT ARE VERY MUCH

05:36:49.856 --> 05:36:51.658
INFORMED BY THE DATA ANALYTICS

05:36:51.724 --> 05:36:52.992
YOU'RE RIGHT SOMETIMES YOU DO

05:36:53.059 --> 05:36:54.427
HAVE TO DO THE MUNDANE WORK OF

05:36:54.494 --> 05:36:55.962
RECONCILING NUMBERS BECAUSE WE

05:36:56.029 --> 05:36:57.597
DON'T WANT TO CREATE THAT LACK

05:36:57.664 --> 05:36:58.665
OF CONFIDENCE.

05:36:58.731 --> 05:37:00.433
WE CAN GET THE FUNDAMENTALS

05:37:00.500 --> 05:37:01.568
RIGHT LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY IS

05:37:01.634 --> 05:37:01.801
THERE.

05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:03.403
IWILL POINT OUT THAT IN THE

05:37:03.469 --> 05:37:04.771
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ITS ITS

05:37:04.837 --> 05:37:06.139
VERY FOCUSED ON THE IMAGE TO SAY

05:37:06.205 --> 05:37:07.941
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE DOLLARS

05:37:08.007 --> 05:37:09.442
THAT ARE EASIER TO TRACK.

05:37:09.509 --> 05:37:11.911
BUT THE IMAGES SAY IS ABOUT 25%

05:37:11.978 --> 05:37:12.812
OF THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH

05:37:12.879 --> 05:37:14.280
FUNDING.

05:37:14.347 --> 05:37:15.615
AND SO AGAIN.

05:37:15.682 --> 05:37:16.749
OUR THIS SITE THAT ALLOW YOU TO

05:37:16.816 --> 05:37:20.553
SEARCH TWENTY ONE HUNDRED

05:37:20.620 --> 05:37:22.255
COMMUNITY PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW --

05:37:22.322 --> 05:37:23.556
IT'S NOT LIVE YET BECAUSE A

05:37:23.623 --> 05:37:24.157
COUPLE LITTLE GLITCHES BUT IN

05:37:24.223 --> 05:37:25.258
THE NEXT YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR

05:37:25.325 --> 05:37:27.560
DAYS IF NOT TOMORROW -- WE HAVE

05:37:27.627 --> 05:37:29.896
REQUIRED THAT CAN'T DAY COUNTIES

05:37:29.963 --> 05:37:31.631
BUT ONLY IN P. E. I. INNOVATION

05:37:31.698 --> 05:37:33.800
PROGRAMS TO REPORT ON HIS BEING

05:37:33.866 --> 05:37:36.035
SERVED BY RACE ETHNICITY AGE

05:37:36.102 --> 05:37:37.537
GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION

05:37:37.604 --> 05:37:39.806
VETERAN STATUS DISABILITY STATUS.

05:37:39.872 --> 05:37:41.341
AND SO THE INTENT REALLY IS TO

05:37:41.407 --> 05:37:43.476
MAKE IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE

05:37:43.543 --> 05:37:44.711
INVESTMENTS OF BEING MADE.

05:37:44.777 --> 05:37:48.514
WHO HAS ACCESS IN ADDITION?

05:37:48.581 --> 05:37:49.382
TO THE KINDS OF OUTCOMES ARE

05:37:49.449 --> 05:37:52.418
BEING ACHIEVED BASED ON THOSE

05:37:52.485 --> 05:37:53.119
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS.

05:37:53.186 --> 05:37:54.754
BUT AGAIN THAT'S ONLY IN THE P.

05:37:54.821 --> 05:37:56.322
I. PIECE BECAUSE THAT'S THE

05:37:56.389 --> 05:37:57.423
LIMIT OF THE COMMISSION'S

05:37:57.490 --> 05:37:58.625
AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THE COUNTY

05:37:58.691 --> 05:38:00.026
TO SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION.

05:38:00.093 --> 05:38:01.094
AND SO YOU KNOW FROM OUR

05:38:01.160 --> 05:38:02.862
PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE A NUMBER

05:38:02.929 --> 05:38:04.163
OF THINGS THE STATE COULD

05:38:04.230 --> 05:38:05.598
ENHANCE THAT WOULD MAKE IT

05:38:05.665 --> 05:38:08.267
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN

05:38:08.334 --> 05:38:09.736
PLACE TODAY WHAT'S WORKING.

05:38:09.802 --> 05:38:11.304
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT'S

05:38:11.371 --> 05:38:12.939
WORKING FOR WHOM AND WHERE

05:38:13.006 --> 05:38:14.674
BECAUSE WE DON'T RECEIVE MENTAL

05:38:14.741 --> 05:38:16.075
HEALTH CARE AT THE STATE LEVEL

05:38:16.142 --> 05:38:18.311
WE RECEIVE IT IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

05:38:18.378 --> 05:38:19.812
YOU KNOW BASED ON WHO WE ARE AND

05:38:19.879 --> 05:38:21.014
BASED ON WHO ARE NEEDS ARE INTO

05:38:21.080 --> 05:38:23.249
THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IS VERY

05:38:23.316 --> 05:38:24.584
CAPTURE BULL.

05:38:24.651 --> 05:38:25.485
BUT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE

05:38:25.551 --> 05:38:27.720
TODAY AREN'T SET UP TO DO THAT

05:38:27.787 --> 05:38:29.155
AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

05:38:29.222 --> 05:38:30.356
IS ANSWER QUESTIONS WE CAN

05:38:30.423 --> 05:38:31.924
ANSWER WITH THE DATA WE HAVE.

05:38:31.991 --> 05:38:33.893
WITH THE INTENT OF DEMONSTRATING

05:38:33.960 --> 05:38:35.662
THE CAPACITY AND THE VALUE OF

05:38:35.728 --> 05:38:37.697
THAT WORK SO THAT WE CAN

05:38:37.764 --> 05:38:39.365
ACTUALLY MOVE THE STATE TOWARDS

05:38:39.432 --> 05:38:41.200
INVESTING MORE TIME AND ENERGY

05:38:41.267 --> 05:38:43.770
AND FOCUS ON THAT THAT LEVEL

05:38:43.836 --> 05:38:45.605
ABOUT COME INFORMATION.

05:38:45.672 --> 05:38:47.874
BIGGEST AT THE ON TERMS OF OF

05:38:47.940 --> 05:38:50.743
FOR DATES YES I MEAN IT'S AS YOU

05:38:50.810 --> 05:38:52.245
POINTED OUT.

05:38:52.311 --> 05:38:53.846
THE TOTALITY OF AN IMAGE A

05:38:53.913 --> 05:38:55.548
FUNDING IS ABOUT A QUARTER RIGHT

05:38:55.615 --> 05:38:57.784
NOW IT'S A QUARTER SO AND THE

05:38:57.850 --> 05:38:58.951
SITE PEOPLE DON'T SIT BACK AND

05:38:59.018 --> 05:39:01.921
GO AND HA FINDING ANY IF THAT

05:39:01.988 --> 05:39:03.456
AND BETTER A. L. AT IT.

05:39:03.523 --> 05:39:06.292
AND I GOT SADDER SO OFTEN IT'S A

05:39:06.359 --> 05:39:08.327
SO THE STORY NEEDS TO BE

05:39:08.394 --> 05:39:09.595
COLLECTED LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE

05:39:09.662 --> 05:39:11.097
VALLEY'S MUCH OF THE POT AS

05:39:11.164 --> 05:39:11.764
POSSIBLE RIHT SO.

05:39:11.831 --> 05:39:13.032
AND I APPRECIATE THAT OFTENTIMES

05:39:13.099 --> 05:39:14.734
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE DON'T

05:39:14.801 --> 05:39:16.335
THE OVERSIGHT WE BRING YOU UP

05:39:16.402 --> 05:39:17.870
YOUR TOBY AND WE'RE LIKE MENTAL

05:39:17.937 --> 05:39:19.038
HEALTH AND LIKELY EARLY I I ONLY

05:39:19.105 --> 05:39:20.173
GOT THIS PIECE OF IT I DON'T YOU

05:39:20.239 --> 05:39:21.541
KNOW I OVERSIGHT YEAH I DON'T

05:39:21.607 --> 05:39:22.442
GET TO OVERSEE ALL OF THAT.

05:39:22.508 --> 05:39:24.877
GREAT SO.

05:39:24.944 --> 05:39:26.145
AS WE CAN IF THERE'S SOME

05:39:26.212 --> 05:39:26.946
MECHANISM WE CAN WORK WITH THE

05:39:27.013 --> 05:39:27.780
COUNTY TO TO PROVIDE SO WE CAN

05:39:27.847 --> 05:39:30.416
ACTUALLY TELL THAT STORY TO THE

05:39:30.483 --> 05:39:31.751
PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY DO

05:39:31.818 --> 05:39:32.885
WHAT WE'RE DOING MENTAL HEALTH

05:39:32.952 --> 05:39:34.353
AND ALSO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY

05:39:34.420 --> 05:39:35.855
THEN TO MOVE THE SHIP IN THE

05:39:35.922 --> 05:39:37.056
DIRECTION.

05:39:37.123 --> 05:39:38.658
THAT WE NEED TO TO BE SURE WE

05:39:38.725 --> 05:39:40.359
ADDRESS THERE AT THAT THE

05:39:40.426 --> 05:39:41.794
PUBLIC'S TOP PRIORITIES.

05:39:41.861 --> 05:39:43.496
SURE AND I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE

05:39:43.563 --> 05:39:45.298
STARTED THAT WORK I THINK. TO

05:39:45.364 --> 05:39:46.966
TELL BRENDA IN TERMS OF JUST HER

05:39:47.033 --> 05:39:48.468
SHE'S SHE'S BIG DATA PERSON

05:39:48.534 --> 05:39:49.635
SHE'S EXCELLENT AT AT THE

05:39:49.702 --> 05:39:50.570
PERFORMANCE OUT COME SYSTEMS

05:39:50.636 --> 05:39:52.038
THAT WE HAVE THOSE OF NOW BEEN

05:39:52.105 --> 05:39:53.106
ADDED TO HAVE.

05:39:53.172 --> 05:39:54.774
THE RACE ETHNICITY AND SOME OF

05:39:54.841 --> 05:39:55.875
THE STUFF THAT THAT -- FOR YOU

05:39:55.942 --> 05:39:57.210
IN WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SO I

05:39:57.276 --> 05:39:59.078
THINK THAT IS WHERE WE'RE GOING

05:39:59.145 --> 05:40:00.546
AS WELL AND BEING ABLE TO REPORT

05:40:00.613 --> 05:40:02.381
THAT ON THE WHOLE THE WHOLE

05:40:02.448 --> 05:40:04.617
SYSTEM -- BECAUSE IT IS

05:40:04.684 --> 05:40:06.252
CONFUSING BECAUSE I WAS THE

05:40:06.319 --> 05:40:06.886
EMERGENCY MONEY CAN ALSO FUND

05:40:06.953 --> 05:40:08.421
MEDI CAL SO IT JUST BECOMES A

05:40:08.488 --> 05:40:10.757
WEIRD -- A WEIRD MIXTURE SO THAT

05:40:10.823 --> 05:40:12.258
IS SORT OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE

05:40:12.325 --> 05:40:13.292
STARTED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS

05:40:13.359 --> 05:40:14.794

05:40:23.770 --> 05:40:25.104
BEFORE I MEAN WE REALLY ARE

05:40:25.171 --> 05:40:26.339
LOOKING AT HOW DO WE HAVE JUST A

05:40:26.405 --> 05:40:28.541
FUNDAMENTAL PICTURE OF WHAT'S

05:40:28.608 --> 05:40:29.609
HAPPENING.

05:40:29.675 --> 05:40:31.110
AND WHO'S GETTING SERVICES AND

05:40:31.177 --> 05:40:32.311
WHERE SERVICES NOT GETTING

05:40:32.378 --> 05:40:33.980
PROVIDED AND HOW WHAT THEN CAN

05:40:34.046 --> 05:40:36.315
WE DO ABOUT THAT SO ABSOLUTELY --

05:40:36.382 --> 05:40:38.284
AND I I AGAIN I I THINK BRENT

05:40:38.351 --> 05:40:39.385
AND HER TEAM IS DONE HAVE DONE A

05:40:39.452 --> 05:40:41.420
TREMENDOUS JOB IN GETTING -- A

SIGNIFICANT MUCH AMOUNT MORE

05:40:43.823 --> 05:40:46.092
DATA THAN IT USED TO BE.

05:40:46.159 --> 05:40:46.726
HEARD ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE

05:40:46.793 --> 05:40:48.427
AND SO HOW DO WE THEN WORK

05:40:48.494 --> 05:40:49.228
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:40:49.295 --> 05:40:51.264
THERE'S ALL I MEANT -- WITH WHAT

05:40:51.330 --> 05:40:52.398
MEASURES WERE LOOKING AT AND HOW

05:40:52.465 --> 05:40:53.466
WE'RE MEASURING THINGS I THINK

05:40:53.533 --> 05:41:04.177
IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION

05:41:04.243 --> 05:41:05.945
AND I KNOW I NUMBER AND IT DOES

05:41:06.012 --> 05:41:06.512
WORK PRETTY CLOSELY WITH.

05:41:06.579 --> 05:41:07.480
THE COMMISSION BUT BUT YES WE

05:41:07.547 --> 05:41:08.080
WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO DO

05:41:08.147 --> 05:41:10.316
THAT.

05:41:10.383 --> 05:41:10.917
OKAY IS TO DETECT ADMINISTERED

05:41:10.983 --> 05:41:11.651
AIR.

05:41:11.717 --> 05:41:13.052
SO -- IN THE COMMENT ABOUT THE

05:41:13.119 --> 05:41:13.619
THE SO THE PURVIEW OF THE

05:41:13.686 --> 05:41:14.921
COMMISSION FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

05:41:14.987 --> 05:41:15.788
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT

05:41:15.855 --> 05:41:16.622
IS EMBEDDED IN THE WELFARE AND

05:41:16.689 --> 05:41:17.657
INSTITUTIONS CODE AND WHILE THE

05:41:17.723 --> 05:41:18.224
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT

05:41:18.291 --> 05:41:18.958
CREATED THE COMMISSION.

05:41:19.025 --> 05:41:19.926
THE CHARGES ON IN THE HOUSE

05:41:19.992 --> 05:41:21.093
SERVICES ACT ARE THINGS LIKE

05:41:21.160 --> 05:41:21.594
REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT.

05:41:21.661 --> 05:41:22.695
AND REDUCING HOMELESSNESS --

05:41:22.762 --> 05:41:23.963
SUPPORTING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES

05:41:24.030 --> 05:41:25.932
FOR CHILDREN PREVENTING THE

05:41:25.998 --> 05:41:27.366
ONSET OF MENTAL ILLNESS SO WE

05:41:27.433 --> 05:41:28.935
ACTUALLY DON'T THINK ABOUT OUR

05:41:29.001 --> 05:41:30.870
PURVIEW IS ONLY IMAGES THEY

05:41:30.937 --> 05:41:32.171
FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT'S GOOD WE

05:41:32.238 --> 05:41:32.905
TAKE THAT WE SAID THE MONEY'S

05:41:32.972 --> 05:41:33.840
HERE.

05:41:33.906 --> 05:41:36.042
THE POLICY IS ACTUALLY QUITE

05:41:36.108 --> 05:41:37.777
BROAD AND IT'S ACTUALLY BROADER

05:41:37.844 --> 05:41:40.313
THAN THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF THE

05:41:40.379 --> 05:41:41.581
DEPARTMENTS.

05:41:41.647 --> 05:41:42.215
WEATHER WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF

05:41:42.281 --> 05:41:43.282
HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE

05:41:43.349 --> 05:41:45.284
SERVICES SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE

05:41:45.351 --> 05:41:46.619
UNDER THE PREVENTION LANGUAGE IT

05:41:46.686 --> 05:41:48.154
BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE

05:41:48.221 --> 05:41:49.222
PREVENTING OUT OF HOME

05:41:49.288 --> 05:41:50.156
PLACEMENTS.

05:41:50.223 --> 05:41:52.391
AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE

05:41:52.458 --> 05:41:52.959
THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS PER

05:41:53.025 --> 05:41:55.828
VIEW IS OVER THE ENTIRE MENTAL

05:41:55.895 --> 05:41:56.996
HEALTH SYSTEM.

05:41:57.063 --> 05:42:00.666
REALLY THINKING MORE ABOUT WELL

05:42:00.733 --> 05:42:01.467
BEING.

05:42:01.534 --> 05:42:02.568
AGAIN DRAWING UPON THAT PO THAT

05:42:02.635 --> 05:42:03.369
PREVENTION LANGUAGE AND SAYING

05:42:03.436 --> 05:42:05.037
HOW DO WE PREVENT THESE BAD

05:42:05.104 --> 05:42:06.505
THINGSFROM HAPPENING SO THAT WE

05:42:06.572 --> 05:42:08.140
ACHIEVE OUTCOMES FOR THE

05:42:08.207 --> 05:42:09.075
COMMUNITY.%

05:42:09.141 --> 05:42:10.810
THAT ARE NOT DRIVEN NECESSARILY

05:42:10.877 --> 05:42:13.012
BY ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS OR A

05:42:13.079 --> 05:42:15.181
MEDICAL NECESSITY IT REALLY IS

05:42:15.248 --> 05:42:16.716
MORE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH

05:42:16.782 --> 05:42:18.951

AT HOME OUT OF TROUBLE.

05:42:24.323 --> 05:42:26.325
AND AND AND WITH THAT PURVIEW WE

05:42:26.392 --> 05:42:27.360
THINK MORE ABOUT THE

05:42:27.426 --> 05:42:28.628
COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY IS PRETTY

THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT IN THE

05:52:10.342 --> 05:52:11.543
END THEY THEN SO.

05:52:11.610 --> 05:52:12.845
WHEN THE SUMMER MULLIN ROAD IS

05:52:12.911 --> 05:52:14.112

05:52:14.179 --> 05:52:15.314
CONSTRAINTS THAT HE HAD TO FACE

05:52:15.380 --> 05:52:16.315
AND TO GET THROUGH THE

05:52:16.381 --> 05:52:17.516
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS?

05:52:17.583 --> 05:52:19.051
THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING

05:52:19.117 --> 05:52:20.052
SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET BASED ON

05:52:20.118 --> 05:52:24.490

THE SAME ISSUE OR SIMILAR ISSUES

SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE

05:52:34.466 --> 05:52:35.467

05:52:35.534 --> 05:52:36.235

RIGHT.

05:53:00.058 --> 05:53:01.360

HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AND THERE'S

05:53:08.300 --> 05:53:09.601
NOTHING FOR CLEANING THEM FROM

05:53:12.804 --> 05:53:14.373
JUST TO NOTE THOUGH AS WELL A

05:53:14.439 --> 05:53:16.008
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE

05:53:16.074 --> 05:53:18.076
TWO PROPOSALS THAT ARE.

05:53:18.143 --> 05:53:18.877

WORKING TOGETHER RIGHT WELL SHE

05:53:30.155 --> 05:53:32.491
THE SAME GOAL.

05:53:32.558 --> 05:53:33.792
IF YOU AS WELL WHAT WE WOULD ASK

05:53:33.859 --> 05:53:34.326
ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER

05:53:34.393 --> 05:53:35.093
INVESTING THE FUNDS INTO THE

05:53:35.160 --> 05:53:35.694
THIRTEEN FIFTEEN PROGRAM WHICH

05:53:35.761 --> 05:53:36.695
WAS SUPPORTED BY THE

05:53:36.762 --> 05:53:38.063
ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR WE

05:53:38.130 --> 05:53:38.564
RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENT

05:53:38.630 --> 05:53:40.432
ADMINISTRATION -- SAME

05:53:40.499 --> 05:53:43.001
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO YOU

05:53:43.068 --> 05:53:44.903
KNOW AGAIN THE THE LAW REQUIRES

05:53:44.970 --> 05:53:45.938
THE COMMISSION TO APPOINT AN

05:53:46.004 --> 05:53:47.439
ADVISORY BODY OF SUCH A MATTER

05:53:47.506 --> 05:53:49.441
EXPERTS. TO ESTABLISH THE

05:53:49.508 --> 05:53:51.143
CRITERIA AND INCLUDING THE

05:53:51.209 --> 05:53:54.479
NOTION OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS --

05:53:54.546 --> 05:53:58.150
AND ALSO YOU KNOW I THINK.

05:53:58.216 --> 05:53:58.984
IT'S THE IDEA THAT THERE IS AN

05:53:59.051 --> 05:54:00.419
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT IS

05:54:00.485 --> 05:54:02.187
MOVING FORWARD THAT IS SECURED

05:54:02.254 --> 05:54:03.655
COUNTY DOLLARS THAT IS ENGAGING

05:54:03.722 --> 05:54:04.923
WITH OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS

05:54:04.990 --> 05:54:05.757
THAT IS BUILDING THIS

05:54:05.824 --> 05:54:07.225
COLLABORATIVE.

05:54:07.292 --> 05:54:08.493

FUNDS ARE ADMINISTERED THROUGH

05:54:09.795 --> 05:54:10.629
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

SERVICES ARE THROUGH THE

05:54:11.997 --> 05:54:12.898
COMMISSION.

05:54:12.965 --> 05:54:14.499
IT'S THE IDEA THAT THE STATE HAS

05:54:14.566 --> 05:54:16.501
ESTABLISHED AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS

05:54:16.568 --> 05:54:18.937
STRATEGY.

05:54:19.004 --> 05:54:20.072
AND IT IT IS.

05:54:20.138 --> 05:54:21.473
BACK TO THAT ISSUE A PUBLIC

05:54:21.540 --> 05:54:23.175
PERCEPTION IS VERY DIFFICULT ON

TAXPAYERS WHO FIND PROPER SIXTY

05:54:30.382 --> 05:54:31.283
THREE WHY THE STATE WOULD

05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:35.621
ESTABLISH A DUPLICATE STRATEGY.

05:54:35.687 --> 05:54:37.122
TO ACHIEVE A COMMON GOAL.

05:54:37.189 --> 05:54:38.156
THE SO WE WOULD ASK

05:54:38.223 --> 05:54:40.993
ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER AGAIN

05:54:41.059 --> 05:54:42.761
OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO PUT

05:54:42.828 --> 05:54:44.463
THOSE FUNDS IN THE THIRTEEN

05:54:44.529 --> 05:54:45.397
FIFTEEN PROGRAM.

05:54:45.464 --> 05:54:46.832

06:04:20.238 --> 06:04:21.873
TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR

06:04:21.940 --> 06:04:22.207
THIS PURPOSE.

06:04:22.273 --> 06:04:25.276
AND COUNTY STRUGGLE TO SPEND

06:04:25.343 --> 06:04:25.877
THESE DOLLARS AND THERE WAS A

06:04:25.944 --> 06:04:28.613
LARGE -- POCK POCKET OF UNSPENT

06:04:28.680 --> 06:04:31.149
FUNDS THE COMMISSION HAD ASKED

06:04:31.216 --> 06:04:32.817
TO REINVEST INTO THE PROGRAM.

06:04:32.884 --> 06:04:34.419
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

06:04:34.485 --> 06:04:36.554
RECOGNIZING THAT THOSE FUNDS

06:04:36.621 --> 06:04:38.323
HADN'T BEEN SPAN RECOMMENDED

06:04:38.389 --> 06:04:40.458
REDUCING THE FUNDING DOWN TO THE

06:04:40.525 --> 06:04:41.693
LEVEL OF FUNDS THAT.

06:04:41.759 --> 06:04:44.028
MORE ACTUALLY REFLECTED WHAT

06:04:44.095 --> 06:04:44.963
COUNTIES HAD SPENT.

06:04:45.029 --> 06:04:46.731
WE UNDERSTAND THAT DECISION IN

06:04:46.798 --> 06:04:49.534
THE CONTEXT OF THINKING OF THESE

06:04:49.601 --> 06:04:50.969
FUNDS AS ACTUALLY.

06:04:51.035 --> 06:04:53.104
SORT OF PROVIDING A A UNIT OF

06:04:53.171 --> 06:04:55.173
STAFFING FOR COUNTIES AND IF THE

06:04:55.240 --> 06:04:56.608
ARGUMENT WAS THAT THE FUNDS WERE

06:04:56.674 --> 06:04:58.610
NECESSARY THEN LET'S REPURPOSE

06:04:58.676 --> 06:05:00.044
THESE FOR OTHER NEEDS.

06:05:00.111 --> 06:05:01.479
HOWEVER WE DON'T THINK OF THESE

06:05:01.546 --> 06:05:03.214
FUNDS AND THAT WAY WE THINK OF

06:05:03.281 --> 06:05:04.816
THESE AS INCENTIVE FUNDS.

06:05:04.882 --> 06:05:05.617
AND WE AT THE AND I'LL GIVE YOU

06:05:05.683 --> 06:05:07.151
THE EXAMPLE THE SCHOOL COUNTY

06:05:07.218 --> 06:05:08.286
COLLABORATIVE'S.

06:05:08.353 --> 06:05:09.988
THERE'S TREMENDOUS UNDERSTANDING

06:05:10.054 --> 06:05:10.722
IN THIS BUILDING AND IN OUR

06:05:10.788 --> 06:05:12.457
COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE MENTAL

06:05:12.523 --> 06:05:13.992
HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN OUR

06:05:14.058 --> 06:05:15.226
SCHOOL SETTING SCHOOLS WHERE THE

06:05:15.293 --> 06:05:17.228
CHILDREN ARE IN OFTEN NGUYEN

06:05:17.295 --> 06:05:18.529
WERE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

06:05:18.596 --> 06:05:20.331
CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE

06:05:20.398 --> 06:05:21.466
WITH FAMILIES.

06:05:21.532 --> 06:05:22.934
IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE CULTURALLY

06:05:23.001 --> 06:05:24.802
AND SOCIALLY APPROPRIATE

06:05:24.869 --> 06:05:26.271
UNDERSTANDING STIGMA THAN THAN

06:05:26.337 --> 06:05:28.373
IS POSSIBLE OUTSIDE OF THE

06:05:28.439 --> 06:05:29.607
SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT.

06:05:29.674 --> 06:05:31.943
WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR CAPACITY

06:05:32.010 --> 06:05:33.211
TO USE THESE DOLLARS TO

06:05:33.278 --> 06:05:34.612
INCENTIVIZE.

06:05:34.679 --> 06:05:36.047
COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS FOR

06:05:36.114 --> 06:05:38.816
EXAMPLE IS TREMENDOUS AND SO --

06:05:38.883 --> 06:05:40.485
WE'RE ASKING FOR RESTORATION OF

06:05:40.551 --> 06:05:43.788
THE FUNDS NOT BECAUSE THE MONEY

06:05:43.855 --> 06:05:45.723
WASN'T USED ORIGINALLY BUT

06:05:45.790 --> 06:05:47.625
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL TO USE

06:05:47.692 --> 06:05:49.193
THESE DOLLARS TO SHAPE HOW

06:05:49.260 --> 06:05:50.928
COUNTY SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY.

06:05:50.995 --> 06:05:52.697
IN WAYS THAT CAN ADDRESS ISSUES

06:05:52.764 --> 06:05:54.899
OF HIGH STATEWIDE CONCERN

06:05:54.966 --> 06:05:55.967
PARTICULARLY SCHOOL MENTAL

06:05:56.034 --> 06:05:58.169
HEALTH BUT NOT LIMITED TO THAT.

06:05:58.236 --> 06:05:59.570
AS THE TRIAGE PROGRAM IS

06:05:59.637 --> 06:06:01.105
DESIGNED TODAY IT IT

06:06:01.172 --> 06:06:03.308
AGGRESSIVELY FOCUSES ON REDUCING

06:06:03.374 --> 06:06:05.576
HOSPITALIZATIONS RESIST REDUCING

06:06:05.643 --> 06:06:07.278
CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT.

06:06:07.345 --> 06:06:08.880
AND AGAIN IN THIS CONTEXT WE

06:06:08.946 --> 06:06:10.515
FOCUSED ON SCHOOLS THE

06:06:10.581 --> 06:06:11.482
COMMISSION IS ASKING FOR

06:06:11.549 --> 06:06:12.917
RESTORATION BUT ALSO

06:06:12.984 --> 06:06:15.153
CONSIDERATION OF FREEING UP

06:06:15.219 --> 06:06:16.921
CONSTRAINTS ON HOW THESE DOLLARS

06:06:16.988 --> 06:06:18.556
ARE USED SO THAT WE CAN CREATE A

06:06:18.623 --> 06:06:20.224
BROADER SET OF INCENTIVES.

06:06:20.291 --> 06:06:21.492
THE DOLLARS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE

06:06:21.559 --> 06:06:26.264
TO COUNTIES THEY'RE ONLY CRISIS

06:06:26.331 --> 06:06:28.132
AND WE SEE THIS AS ONE OF THE

06:06:28.199 --> 06:06:30.134
STATE'S MOST SIGNIFICANT TOOLS

06:06:30.201 --> 06:06:31.102
IN SHAPING HOW COUNTIES USE

06:06:31.169 --> 06:06:33.071
THEIR DOLLARS WE WANT TO BE ABLE

06:06:33.137 --> 06:06:34.472
TO LEVERAGE THESE FUNDS. TO TAKE

06:06:34.539 --> 06:06:37.108
ADVANTAGE OF THE ALL TWO BILLION

06:06:37.175 --> 06:06:38.810
OF MHSAA BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

06:06:38.876 --> 06:06:40.611
THE EIGHT AND A HALF BILLION

06:06:40.678 --> 06:06:42.213
THAT IS AVAILABLE OVERALL. TO

06:06:42.280 --> 06:06:43.648
REALLY SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF

06:06:43.715 --> 06:06:44.949
COUNTIES TO FOCUS ON ISSUES

06:06:45.016 --> 06:06:46.984
WHERE THEY HAVEN'T ON THEIR OWN

06:06:47.051 --> 06:06:48.619
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT MEANS IT

06:06:48.686 --> 06:06:49.654
CAN OVER THE LONG OVER THE

06:06:49.721 --> 06:06:51.889
LONGER TERM REDUCE STATE COSTS

06:06:51.956 --> 06:06:54.325
AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES STATEWIDE.

06:06:54.392 --> 06:06:55.793
I THANK YOU LA YOU COMMENTS

06:06:55.860 --> 06:06:57.895
FINANCE.

06:06:57.962 --> 06:06:59.030
OKAY.

06:06:59.097 --> 06:07:00.231
THE SHOWS GOING AS YOU NEED

06:07:00.298 --> 06:07:01.632
ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHICH WAS

06:07:01.699 --> 06:07:02.967
THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT DO

06:07:03.034 --> 06:07:04.736
WE ARE WE OVERLY RESTRICTED THE

06:07:04.802 --> 06:07:06.571
FUNDS THAT WE NOT PUT ENOUGH

06:07:06.637 --> 06:07:09.407
INTO -- OTHERS T. AIR EDUCATING

06:07:09.474 --> 06:07:12.110
THE FOLKS THAT YOU TRY TARGET TO

06:07:12.176 --> 06:07:13.211
THIS TO WHY WOULD PEOPLE WEREN'T

06:07:13.277 --> 06:07:14.245
ASKING AS MUCH FOR THE MONEY

06:07:14.312 --> 06:07:16.481
RIGHT SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE

06:07:16.547 --> 06:07:18.816
VIEW THE YOU SAY WELL WE ARE TO

06:07:18.883 --> 06:07:19.917
GIVE YOU MONEY FOR ACTS BUT

06:07:19.984 --> 06:07:21.285
ACTUALLY THE RESTRICTIONS ARE

06:07:21.352 --> 06:07:23.020
NECESSARILY THE ONES THAT.

06:07:23.087 --> 06:07:24.889
THE OF THE FACILITY ACTUALLY

06:07:24.956 --> 06:07:27.258
USING THE MONEY SO -- SO AS SOON

06:07:27.325 --> 06:07:29.060
THAT'S PAR YOUR PROPOSAL IS THAT

06:07:29.127 --> 06:07:30.395
WE SHOULD TRY TO LOOSEN SOME OF

06:07:30.461 --> 06:07:33.030
THOSE CONSTRAINTS ABSOLUTELY YES

06:07:33.097 --> 06:07:33.698
OKAY -- DURING THE RATE THE PART

06:07:33.765 --> 06:07:34.999
OF THE REASON THE COUNTY

06:07:35.066 --> 06:07:36.234
STRUGGLE TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS

06:07:36.300 --> 06:07:37.702
WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE LIMITED

06:07:37.769 --> 06:07:38.469
PERSONNEL.

06:07:38.536 --> 06:07:40.171
AND SO ONE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE

06:07:40.238 --> 06:07:41.839
HAD A VERY WELL INTENTIONED

06:07:41.906 --> 06:07:44.475
PROGRAM TO REDUCE -- E. R.

06:07:44.542 --> 06:07:45.710
UTILIZATION.

06:07:45.777 --> 06:07:47.712
RIGHT AT THE ISSUE CAME UP OF

06:07:47.779 --> 06:07:50.915
WHO WHO'S SUPERVISES THE STAFF

06:07:50.982 --> 06:07:52.550
THE E. R. OR THE COUNTY.

06:07:52.617 --> 06:07:55.186
OKAY HAND DELAYS IN NEGOTIATING

06:07:55.253 --> 06:07:56.921
AN ANIMAL YOU RESULTED IN IT

06:07:56.988 --> 06:08:00.224
THIS COUNTY ACTUALLY WAS I ABLE

06:08:00.291 --> 06:08:01.125
TO TAP THE FUNDS FOR TWO YEARS

06:08:01.192 --> 06:08:02.927
NOW BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF

06:08:02.994 --> 06:08:05.296
CONFLICT GOING ON HAD NOTHING TO

06:08:05.363 --> 06:08:06.497
DO WITH THE FUNDS RIGHT.

06:08:06.564 --> 06:08:07.732
WE'VE PUT IN PLACE

06:08:07.799 --> 06:08:08.733
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT

06:08:08.800 --> 06:08:09.667
THOSE FAMILIES HAVE TO BE IN

06:08:09.734 --> 06:08:11.636
PLACE BEFORE YOU ASK NOT AFTER

06:08:11.702 --> 06:08:13.004
YOU ASKED IN ORDER TO SHORTEN

06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.805
THAT TIME FRAME.

06:08:13.871 --> 06:08:16.040
BUT IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THAT AT

06:08:16.107 --> 06:08:23.314
THE TIME AND I WASN'T HERE AT

06:08:23.381 --> 06:08:24.048
THE TIME.

06:08:24.115 --> 06:08:25.450
THE INTENT WAS TO SORT OF CREATE

06:08:25.516 --> 06:08:25.917
A SURGE OF STAFFING.

06:08:25.983 --> 06:08:26.584
PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS

06:08:26.651 --> 06:08:27.318
COUNY STRUGGLE TO SUSTAIN

06:08:27.385 --> 06:08:28.586
STAFFING WHEN THEY HAVE TO GET A

06:08:28.653 --> 06:08:29.220
THREE YEAR GRANT IT'S ALSO HARD

06:08:29.287 --> 06:08:30.588
TO HIRE PEOPLE FOR THIRTY SIX

06:08:30.655 --> 06:08:32.256
MONTH JOB I PARTICULARLY

06:08:32.323 --> 06:08:33.291
RECOGNIZING THE WORK FORCE

06:08:33.357 --> 06:08:34.692
CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN THIS FIELD.

06:08:34.759 --> 06:08:36.661
SO ABSOLUTELY THE COMMISSION IS

06:08:36.727 --> 06:08:37.895
LOOKING AT THIS VERY DIFFERENTLY

06:08:37.962 --> 06:08:39.096
AND SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT

06:08:39.163 --> 06:08:41.399
SEARCH OF STAFFING. FOR CRISIS

06:08:41.466 --> 06:08:43.234
IT'S ABOUT HOW CAN WE CREATE

06:08:43.301 --> 06:08:45.303
INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT CLAVINET

06:08:45.369 --> 06:08:47.171
PARTNERSHIPS AND IN SOME CASES

06:08:47.238 --> 06:08:47.939
ON THE SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH

06:08:48.005 --> 06:08:49.373
DOLLARS THE COMMISSION RECEIVED

06:08:49.440 --> 06:08:51.108
NUMEROUS CALLS FROM SCHOOLS WHO

06:08:51.175 --> 06:08:52.543
WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

06:08:52.610 --> 06:08:54.378
BUT FIRST BUT FOR OFTEN VERY

06:08:54.445 --> 06:08:55.513
GOOD REASONS THERE COUNTIES ONE

06:08:55.580 --> 06:08:58.616
IN A POSITION THEY DIDN'T HAVE

06:08:58.683 --> 06:08:59.217
THE STAFF TO APPLY.

06:08:59.283 --> 06:09:00.017
THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

06:09:00.084 --> 06:09:01.819
SUSTAINABILITY PIECE THE LAW WAS

06:09:01.886 --> 06:09:03.154
PRESCRIPTIVE AND IT DID NOT

06:09:03.221 --> 06:09:05.756
ALLOW US. TO HAVE THE SCHOOL

06:09:05.823 --> 06:09:07.358
RECEIVED THE DOLLARS AND TO

06:09:07.425 --> 06:09:08.893
EITHER DO THAT IN PARTNERSHIP

06:09:08.960 --> 06:09:10.495
WITH THE COMMUNITY CARE PROVIDER

06:09:10.561 --> 06:09:12.597
OR OR EVEN HAVE THE SCHOOL APPLY

06:09:12.663 --> 06:09:13.664
AND PARTNER WITH THE COUNTIES

06:09:13.731 --> 06:09:14.599
AND HAVE A GO THAT WAY.

06:09:14.665 --> 06:09:16.701
AND SO YES WE WOULD ASK FOR SOME

06:09:16.767 --> 06:09:17.935
LOOSENING OF THE CONSTRAINTS SO

06:09:18.002 --> 06:09:19.070
THAT WE CAN BETTER TAILOR THE

06:09:19.136 --> 06:09:21.372
PROGRAM TO THE NEEDS OF THE

06:09:21.439 --> 06:09:22.740
COUNTIES.

06:09:22.807 --> 06:09:24.275
ALL RIGHT MAKES LICENSED ME.

06:09:24.342 --> 06:09:25.543

06:54:49.264 --> 06:54:50.265
IT MORE DETAILED STUDY BUT YET I

06:54:50.332 --> 06:54:51.366
WE KNOW WHERE THE FOUR HUNDRED

06:54:51.433 --> 06:54:52.100
MILLION NEED IS NOW.

06:54:52.167 --> 06:54:53.768
OKAY RIGHT OKAY SO BECAUSE I

06:54:53.835 --> 06:54:55.070
THINK WE WE NEED TO THINK MORE

06:54:55.136 --> 06:54:56.605
SYSTEMATICALLY ABOUT THIS I

06:54:56.671 --> 06:54:58.940
APPRECIATE THAT AND THE BRAIN

06:54:59.007 --> 06:55:01.943
BRAIN THE THESE FORD BYE THINK

06:55:02.010 --> 06:55:02.344
WE NEED TO THINK.

06:55:02.410 --> 06:55:03.745
AND DON'T TELL US A LITTLE BIT A

06:55:03.812 --> 06:55:05.347
JOKE IS EVERY I THINK EVERY

06:55:05.413 --> 06:55:06.548
SEGMENT THE STATE WE'RE HEARING

06:55:06.615 --> 06:55:11.953
ABOUT SPURRED MAINTENANCE AND

06:55:12.020 --> 06:55:12.520
MAINTENANCE BACKLOGS AND SO

06:55:12.587 --> 06:55:13.922
FORTH AND ALSO I THINK THE OTHER

06:55:13.989 --> 06:55:15.523
PART IS IS THAT -- AND

06:55:15.590 --> 06:55:17.192
RECOGNIZING WE HAVE A LOT ROOFS

06:55:17.259 --> 06:55:18.293
AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS

06:55:18.360 --> 06:55:20.462
WONDER THAT YOU DON'T FIX A ROOF

06:55:20.528 --> 06:55:21.096
THAT DAMAGE GETS WORSE AND WHAT

06:55:21.162 --> 06:55:21.329
I MEAN.

06:55:21.396 --> 06:55:23.932
THAT IT DOESN'T STAY STILL ALL

06:55:23.999 --> 06:55:25.367
RIGHT IT'S JUST AND THOUGH.

06:55:25.433 --> 06:55:26.701
SO WE US WE NEED A PLAN TO START

06:55:26.768 --> 06:55:28.069
TACKLING THESE AND PRIORITIZING

06:55:28.136 --> 06:55:29.170
SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

06:55:29.237 --> 06:55:29.938
FURTHER DEGRADATION YOUR

06:55:30.005 --> 06:55:30.238
FACILITIES.

06:55:30.305 --> 06:55:31.373
AS WELL AND RECOGNIZING ALSO THE

06:55:31.439 --> 06:55:32.007
NATURE OF OUR BUDGETS AND

06:55:32.073 --> 06:55:32.674
ECONOMIC CYCLES THAT WE WANT TO

06:55:32.741 --> 06:55:34.809
BE SURE WE HAVE A STRATEGY THAT

06:55:34.876 --> 06:55:36.878
WHEN WE HAVE THOSE FUNDS

06:55:36.945 --> 06:55:38.980
AVAILABLE WE CAN TRY.

06:55:39.047 --> 06:55:42.050
TO GET ON TOP OF THEM -- SO --

06:55:42.117 --> 06:55:43.618

FOR TWO YEARS FROM NOW RIGHT WE

06:55:44.886 --> 06:55:49.658
EXPECT TO HAVE A THE BACK THE

06:55:49.724 --> 06:55:50.959
PLAN WILL BE SPEAKING BEFORE

06:58:14.269 --> 06:58:15.203
AN EX NUMBER YEARS WE ANTICIPATE

06:58:15.270 --> 06:58:17.572
WE WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE AFFECTS

06:58:17.639 --> 06:58:18.573

06:58:37.959 --> 06:58:38.993
WAS GONNA LAST ANOTHER TEN YEARS

06:58:39.060 --> 06:58:40.962
OR SOMETHING BUT I'M JUST TRYING

06:58:41.029 --> 06:58:43.364
TO GET IT THE TERMS OF THINKING-OF THIS IS A MORE DYNAMIC THING

06:58:43.431 --> 06:58:44.766
THAT SIMPLY A ASSESSMENT IN A

06:58:44.833 --> 06:58:45.567
LIST OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

06:58:45.633 --> 06:58:46.534
FIXED.

06:58:46.601 --> 06:58:47.101
YEAH AND WE DON'T HAVE OUR

HAVE -- I BELIEVE IT'S A FIVE

06:58:52.207 --> 06:58:53.241
YEAR PLAN FOR THE RIGHT HOSPITAL

06:58:53.308 --> 06:58:55.276
OUTLAY PROJECTS AS WELL SO

06:58:55.343 --> 06:58:55.944
BEYOND JUST THE GENERAL

06:58:56.010 --> 06:58:56.945
MAINTENANCE.

06:58:57.011 --> 06:58:58.813
THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSING

06:58:58.880 --> 06:59:01.249
AND AND DOING THOSE THE PLANNING

06:59:01.316 --> 06:59:02.851
FOR THE LARGER CAP OUTLAY

06:59:02.917 --> 06:59:05.520
PROJECTS AS WELL OKAY SO I MEAN

06:59:05.587 --> 06:59:06.754
I THINK THATSERVE ALONG WITH

06:59:06.821 --> 06:59:08.223
THE LA I WAS SAYING WE WE WANT

06:59:08.289 --> 06:59:09.157
TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE GOOD

06:59:09.224 --> 06:59:11.259
STEWARDS OF OUR PROPERTIES WALLS

06:59:11.326 --> 06:59:13.394
ARE FINANCES AND AS WE'RE

06:59:13.461 --> 06:59:13.661
PUTTING.

06:59:13.728 --> 06:59:16.364
TOGETHER THIS PLAN AND GETTING A

06:59:16.431 --> 06:59:19.067
SENSE BECAUSE BUT CERTAIN YEAH.

06:59:19.133 --> 06:59:20.502
SO SO WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT AND

06:59:20.568 --> 06:59:23.471
WHERE WE'RE HEADED TO AND I

06:59:23.538 --> 06:59:24.839
THINK THAT THAT AND SO THAT WE

06:59:24.906 --> 06:59:26.574
CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS

06:59:26.641 --> 06:59:28.376
RIGHT AND NOW SOMETIMES FISCAL

06:59:28.443 --> 06:59:29.711
CONSTRAINTS WILL BE WILL.

06:59:29.777 --> 06:59:32.247
WE KNOW WE'RE FALLING BEHIND AT

06:59:32.313 --> 06:59:33.915
LEAST WERE CONSCIOUSLY DOING IT

06:59:33.982 --> 06:59:36.751
RIGHT AND IF THERE'S OPERATE TO

06:59:36.818 --> 06:59:37.452
CONSCIOUSLY GET AHEAD.

06:59:37.519 --> 06:59:38.820
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO

06:59:38.887 --> 06:59:41.556
SELL BUT IF WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

06:59:41.623 --> 06:59:49.130
WE THINK WE ARE WHATEVER SO WE

06:59:49.197 --> 06:59:51.533
NEED A ROADMAP.

06:59:51.599 --> 06:59:52.133
AND WE HAVE A PRETTY DETAILED

06:59:52.200 --> 06:59:53.835
ROAD MAP OF WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO

06:59:53.902 --> 06:59:54.502
SEE OVER THE YEARS IN THE IN THE

06:59:54.569 --> 06:59:55.470
THE STUDY OF OUR FACILITIES WITH

06:59:55.537 --> 06:59:56.337
THE EXPERTISE WE HAVE.

06:59:56.404 --> 06:59:57.305
THE INFRASTRUCTURE MASTER PLAN

06:59:57.372 --> 06:59:58.673
WILL GO MUCH DEEPER TO THAT AND

06:59:58.740 --> 06:59:59.541
AND ADDRESS ART OUT YEARS TEN

06:59:59.607 --> 07:00:00.108
TWENTY THIRTY YEARS DOWN THE

07:00:00.174 --> 07:00:00.308
ROAD.

07:00:00.375 --> 07:00:00.942
BUT CERTAINLY THAT FOUR HUNDRED

07:00:01.009 --> 07:00:01.509
MILLION REPRESENTS A LOT OF

07:00:01.576 --> 07:00:02.744
STUDY AN EVALUATION OF OUR

07:00:02.810 --> 07:00:03.711
SYSTEMS PRIMARILY ESPECIALLY IN

07:00:03.778 --> 07:00:05.914
AREAS OF PATIENT SAFETY --

07:00:05.980 --> 07:00:06.814
FIRELIGHT AND SAFETY FOR THE

07:00:06.881 --> 07:00:09.083
FACILITIES FOR THE STAFF AS WELL

07:00:09.150 --> 07:00:10.418
OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL.

07:00:10.485 --> 07:00:13.154
APPRECIATE WERE.

07:00:13.221 --> 07:00:15.089
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE HERE BUT

07:00:15.156 --> 07:00:16.991
THAT THAT THAT THAT.

07:00:17.058 --> 07:00:18.760
AND CERTAINLY WE WANT TO TAKE

07:00:18.826 --> 07:00:20.628
CARE OF THEM BUT SERIOUS STUFF

07:00:20.695 --> 07:00:21.362
BUT IT.

07:00:21.429 --> 07:00:22.263
I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW --

07:00:22.330 --> 07:00:24.699
EVEN.

07:00:24.766 --> 07:00:26.100
THAT'S WAS ASKING I'M I FALLING

07:00:26.167 --> 07:00:26.801
FOR IT IS THAT THE THIRTY FIVE
