I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS FOR ACCOMMODATING REQUESTS PRESENT AT THIS HEARING- DURING THE ERA OF THE PANDEMIC. HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX TOPIC. YOU CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE PEOPLE RECEIVE AND REDUCE THE COST OF THAT CARE BY REDUCING DUPLICATIVE TESTS AND PROCEDURES. TODAY'S HEARING WILL TOUCH ON FIVE AREAS FIRST HE WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH A PRESENTATION ON WHAT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEANS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT AND THE EXISTING HEALTH AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. SECOND WE WILL HEAR WHAT HAS BEEN DONE DATE DONE TO DATE BY THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY EXAMINING RECENT STATE AND FEDERAL EFFORTS. TO ENCOURAGE H. I. E. THAT'S HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THROUGH FINANCING THE TO THE ADOPTION. AND USE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS AND CONNECT PROVIDERS TO REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS. THIRD WILL HEAR ON THE FORTHCOMING FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO H. I. E. FOURTH WE WILL HEAR FROM THE CEO OF MARYLAND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ORGANIZATION- ARE KNOWN BY THE ACRONYM CHRIS- AND ON ON WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE RELATED TO HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AND FIFTH WE WILL CONCLUDE WITH A PRESENTATION ON POLICY OPTIONS- TO INCREASE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE IS MY GOAL THE TODAY'S HEALTH INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL PROVIDE OF FOUNDATIONAL BASIS OF INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE IN ANTICIPATION OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION- WE DO HAVE SOME. OTHER MEMBERS ATTENDING TODAY WE HAVE ONE AND ONE IN THE CHAMBER AND OTHERS ATTENDING REMOTELY IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ME OPEN REMARKS- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY WHICH I HAVING ANYTHING TO SAY. OKAY ANY OF OUR- MEMBERS WHO ARE ATTENDING REMOTELY IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO- HAVE ANY OPEN REMARKS. I'M NOT SURE WHICH SCREEN TO LOOK AT OKAY. NOPE CURRENTLY NOT OKAY. SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD OF FROM. WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKER OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS- WHAT DR WALTER- SO JANSKY- IS A PRESIDENT WHO JANSKY ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATES EXCUSE ME THE AUTHOR OF PROMISE AND PITFALLS A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS. SO WITH THAT AND I WANT TO THANK A DOCTOR SUGGESTS THE FROM WHOSE TESTIFYING FOR MARK AND ARE OAKLAND REMOTE TESTIMONY SITE THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO GO THERE SO- WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DO DOCTORS SUGGEST SKI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HOPE YOU ALL CAN HEAR ME GOOD AFTERNOON. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FIRST OF ALL FOR INVITING ME HERE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I HOPE MY REMARKS TODAY WILL BE. HELPFUL TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. NICK'S FIRST SLIDE PLEASE. JUST A NOTE I CANNOT SEE THIS LIGHT SO I'M HOPING THEY'RE COMING UP. CAN I GET AN AFFIRMATIVE FOR MARIA YEAH. YES FIRST FIGHT IS UP. FIRST LIGHT IS UP THANK YOU TITLE SLIDE ANYWAY SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO THE SECOND SLIDE. IT'S UP. SO A QUICKLY I TO BEGIN THINGS IN THIS HEARING I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DISCUSS A FEW SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE OR H. I. E. AS IT'S KNOWN- BEGINNING WITH A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WHAT IT IS TO BEGIN WITH AND HOW THAT TERM IS USED. AS FOR BACKGROUND AND ALSO WHAT THE IMPETUS IS FOR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE TO BEGIN WITH WHY WE CARE ABOUT WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY AND THEN GOING TO TALK ABOUT OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE TECHNICAL MODELS FOR PROVIDING IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOME OF THESE BOTTLES IS RELEVANT TO POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS AND ALSO TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THOSE MODELS IN OUR STATE. AT THE PRESENT TIME AND HOW THOSE- WORK WHERE THEY WORK THEY ARE AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER AND SO FORTH AND THEN LASTLY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WOULD GAPS REMAIN IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN CALIFORNIA AND- AND WHAT WHY THAT IS THE CASE THE SENATE UP FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO WILL TALK LATER ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS OF ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO FIRST A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT ON TERMINOLOGY SINCE THE TERM HA ITSELF CAN BE AMBIGUOUS- SO. ESSENTIALLY IT'S OFTEN USED IN TO. SOMEWHAT DISTINCT WAYS FIRST AS H. I. E. THE BIRD AND IN THIS SENSE REFERS TO THE ACT OF ELECTRONICALLY SHARING PATIENT DATA. AMONG DESPERATE HEALTH CARE. ORGANIZATIONS SHARING OF THAT THE ACT OF SHARING THAT DATA- IT DOESN'T THAT THAT USE DOESN'T ASSUME ANY PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION INVOLVED WITH IT OR TYPE OF ORGANIZATION INVOLVED WITH IT- IT'S JUST A THE GENERAL- FACT OF. PERFORMING THAT SHARING. IN THE SECOND USE THAT THEN HA THE NOUN. IN IN DISTINCTION IS OFTEN USED TO REFER TO AN ACTUAL SPECIFIC CENTRAL ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES SOME FORM OF TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE. HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN MOST OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS SERVE A PARTICULAR REGION AND OR A PARTICULAR GROUP OF. CONSTITUENTS AND PARTICIPANTS ACROSS EVEN ACROSS REGIONS. SO I'M NOT A FAN OF. THIS USING THE TERM. AS A AS A NOUN BECAUSE IT'S CONFUSING AND AMBIGUOUS SO MAYBE FOR PURPOSES OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION MY PRESENTATION TODAY TO AVOID CONFUSION. I'LL BE USING. HEALTH INFORMATION FOR. OR H. I. O. WHEN REFERRING TO THE NOUN FORM. OUR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT HIV THE FOR THE ACT OF SHARING INFORMATION ESSENTIALLY BOILS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT OUR OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM REMAINS FRAGMENTED- IN THE SENSE THAT A SINGLE PATIENT RECEIVING FOR A NORMAL COURSE OF CARE ANY ANY COMPLEX COURSE OF CARE WHATSOEVER WHATSOEVER NEEDS TO SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WORKING IN A LOT OF DISTINCT ENTERPRISES- OR ORGANIZATIONS FROM- THAT SAID NOT NINE O'CLOCK IN THIS PARTICULAR DIAGRAM STARTING WITH A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. THAT MAY IDENIFY A LUMP OF SOME SORT SOMEWHERE SENDING THEM OFF TO NUMBER TWELVE THE IMAGING CENTER A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION- WHERE SCANNING IS PERFORMED AND- PERHAPS- CANCER FOUND A NECESSITATING A TRIP TO AN ONCOLOGIST AT A SPECIALTY CLINIC AT NUMBER FIVE. ON THIS DIAGRAM AND THEN OFF TO THE HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY NUMBER ONE AND THEN A REHAB CENTER- NUMBERS- NUMBER THREE FOLLOWING THAT AND SO FORTH ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT BUSINESS ENTITIES THAT MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTH IT PURCHASING DECISIONS AND IN FACT OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES AND DON'T SHARE MEDICAL RECORDS- IN IN THEIR NATIVE FORM. SO N. AND IN FACT A STILL TODAY THERE'S LIMITED VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION OF THE CLINICAL PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS- ACROSS THESE ORGANIZATIONS ALTHOUGH THERE CERTAINLY- BEEN A MORE CONSOLIDATION AMONG THESE ORGANIZATIONS NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE SHARING OF HEALTH INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT AND HAS VALUE TO ORGANIZATIONS FROM FROM VARIOUS PARTS PERSPECTIVES. SO THROUGHOUT THIS CARE PROCESS WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE. WHAT TO WHAT IS THE USE OF H. WATER USE CASES ARE EXAMPLES OF HOW HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE- MAY BE VALUABLE TO PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO ONE WAY OF USING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES TO FACILITATE TRANSFERS OF CARE SO FOR EXAMPLE POSITION SEEING A BRAND NEW PATIENT- IN HIS OR HER OFFICE. WHO HAS RECEIVED A LOT OF CARE IN THE PAST AT OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT HIS NEW TO THIS CONDITION THAT THAT THAT POSITION IN ORDER TO GET A FULL PICTURE THAT PATIENTS HISTORY REALLY WOULD NEED TO COLLECT AND AGGREGATE DATA FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER. TO BE ABLE TO- MOST EFFECTIVELY ASSESS THE NEEDS AND PROVIDES THE THERAPEUTIC SERVICES SCREENING SERVICES WERE NOT FOR THAT PATIENT. SECONDLY A PHYSICIAN MAY REFER THEM THAT PATIENT TO A SPECIALIST THAT SPECIALIST'S WOULD SIMILARLY NEED A LOT OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION MORE THAN THE PHYSICIAN MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE JUST IN THE REFERRAL REQUEST. ARE ALSO PATIENTS IN EMERGENCY ROOMS WITH MANY CHRONIC CONDITIONS OFTEN- AND CMPLICATED CLINICAL HISTORY. BUT WITHOUT BRINGING THEIR OWN MEDICAL RECORDS TO THAT URGENT SITUATION- MAIN RESUSCITATE THE EMERGENCY ROOM BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR PAST MEDICAL HISTORY. NORD ASCERTAIN PERHAPS WHAT WHAT ASPECT OF THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURRENT VERSION CONDITION. AND ACCESS TO ALL THOSE DATA WERE IMPORTANT FOR THAT FINALLY A PATIENT IS DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL OFTEN THEY GO TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. OR OTHER A STEP DOWN TYPE% FACILITIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT NEED IN CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THAT'S PATIENTS HOSPITALIZATION. A RIGHT AWAY AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE- SO THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT TRANSFER OF CARE USE CASES. ARE OF ANOTHER- CATEGORY OF USEFUL HIV COVERS NOTIFICATION OF CARE. FOR EXAMPLE POSITION BEING NOTIFIED OF THIS PATIENT IS BEING SEEN OR WAS SEEING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE DISCHARGED. THE POSITION CAN FOLLOW UP EFFECTIVELY WITH THEM- TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP CARE MAYBE PREVENT FUTURE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT OR HOSPITALIZATION- SIMILARLY INSURERS- BENEFIT FROM FROM NOTIFICATION- OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN MANAGE. A DISCHARGE PLANNING- AND OTHER SERVICES. AND AS WELL AS- OFTEN BENEFIT FROM BEING NOTIFIED WHEN IT WHAT A PATIENT THAT'S BEEN REFERRED AS ACTUALLY VISITED THE SPECIALIST OFTEN- SOMETIMES PATIENTS DON'T BOTHER TO HOLD THEIR IMPORTANT SPECIALIST VISITS- TO CARDIOLOGISTS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH CAN HAVE ADVERSE EVENT. AFFECTS ON THEIR HEALTH- AND IF THEIR POSITION WERE AWARE THAT THEY COULD INTERVENE AND- I THINK COURAGE TO START THE HOLDING OF AB VISIT- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OTHER IMPORTANT USE CASES INCLUDE COORDINATION OR OVERSIGHT OF CARE LOOKING ACROSS ALL PATIENT POPULATION FOR EXAMPLE AN INSURER HAVING ENOUGH DATA FROM MULTIPLE. ORGANIZATIONS TO TRACK WHETHER PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED A NEED OF PREVENTIVE SCREEN CARE THIS IS ALREADY DONE BY MANY INSURERS TODAY BUT THEY RELY ON CLAIMS DATA LARGELY WHICH IS OUT OF DATE AND OFTEN INCOMPLETE. AND SO THE THEIR PICTURE OF THE PATIENTS- FULL FULL HISTORY IN THIS REGARD- IS SUBOPTIMAL HAVING ACCESS TO CLINICAL DATA FROM ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS WERE PATIENT HAS BEEN SEEN WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE THAT- SIMILARLY PHYSICIANS ARE INCREASINGLY ORGANIZING IN ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER- OF PARTNERSHIPS- THAT TAKE ON CLINICAL RISK. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO- TO ALSO HAVE A FULL PICTURE OF WHERE PATIENTS RECEIVED VARIOUS TYPES OF THERAPEUTIC AND UP. IN PREVENTIVE AND SO FORTH CARE ALSO IN FOR- OF. SAFETY NET PATIENTS ARE SEEN IN COMMUNITY CLINIC ENVIRONMENTS- THEY OFTEN RECEIVE TREATMENT OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL RECEIVE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT- SUCH AS AT SUBSTANCE ABUSE CENTERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SO FORTH AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR THE COMMUNITY CLINIC HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. TO ALSO HAVE A PICTURE OF THESE- NONTRADITIONAL SERVICES THAT HAVE A BEARING ON A PATIENT'S MEDICAL CARE. AND A AND LASTLY THERE THE THERE'S VALUE IN MORE PROSAIC TYPES OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE JUST MORE EFFICIENTLY COMMUNICATING MEDICAL DATA THAT IS ALREADY COMMUNICATED TODAY- SUCH AS LAB RESULTS AND- IMMUNIZATION RECORDS CASE REPORTS SO FORTH BUT DIDN'T OFTEN IN INEFFICIENT SLOW. AT WAYS THAT INTRODUCED DELAY. AN EXTRA COST SO ACROSS ALL THESE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THESE VARIOUS USE CASES FOR HIV GENERATE- SOCIAL VALUE I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IN AT LEAST THREE WAYS FIRST IS- JUST CLINICAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT THROUGH PROMPTLY PROVIDING ALL THE CLINICAL DATA RELATED TO A PATIENT- THROUGH TRACKING MAKING SURE PATIENTS RECEIVE PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES TO PREVENT DISEASE. AND A POORLY MEASURING. AND REPORTING ON QUALITY OF CARE ACROSS DIFFERENT PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS- AND THAT REPORTING AND TRACKING UNTO ITSELF- THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THAT HELPS IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE- BYE BYE- ENCOURAGING PROVIDERS TO FOCUS ON IT IMPORTANTLY IN ORDER TO DO THAT EFFECTIVELY. FOR MORE VALUE BASED CARE PROGRAMS ALL ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS ONE NEEDS TO OF. RISK ADJUST THOSE DATA APPROPRIATELY IN ORDER TO DO THAT THE FULL CLINICAL PICTURE OF THE PATIENT'S SITUATION NEEDS TO BE KNOWN ALL THE PATIENTS DATA NEEDS TO BE FACTORED IN A INCLUDING A SOCIAL DETERMINANT DATA NOT JUST MEDICAL DATA- SO THAT'S THAT'S A- DOES A WAYS IN WHICH HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE CAN IMPROVE- CLINICAL QUALITY. TERMS OF COST CONTROL OBVIOUSLY ACCESS TO PRIOR RECENT TEST RESULTS CAN- OBVIATE THE NEED TO REDO THOSE TESTS JUST TO BECAUSE THE RESULTS AREN'T. DON'T HAPPEN TO BE AVAILABLE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR A SPECIALIST THAT THAT THEIR OBVIOUS COST SAVINGS AND NOT ESPECIALLY FOR VERY EXPENSIVE TYPE OF IMAGING STUDIES AND SO FORTH- IN IN IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE CAN ALSO REDUCE COSTS BY REDUCING HOSPITALIZATIONS OR RE HOSPITALIZATIONS WHEN BETTER CARES PROVIDING OUTPATIENT. SETTING AND EARLIER INTERVENTIONS CAN BEFORE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE KNOWN TO BE NEEDED- AGAIN HAVING A FULL PICTURE OF THE PATIENT'S CLINICAL DATA CAN ASSIST WITH THAT AND OF COURSE THERE'S REDUCING THE ADMINISTRATIVE. COSTS AND INEFFICIENT PAPER BASED COMMUNICATIONS FINALLY NOT NOT LEAST IMPORTANTLY THESE DAYS THERE'S A PUBLIC VALLEY SICK PUBLIC HEALTH VALUE IN SHARING PATIENT DATA AGGREGATING PATIENT DATA. TO GET MORE COMPLETE PICTURES OF PATIENT CARE FOR PURPOSE OF DIZZY SURVEY. EPIDEMIOLOGY CONTACT TRACING AND SO FORTH FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN CASE REPORTS ARE RECEIVED OF COCA NINETEEN POSITIVE RESULTS- PERHAPS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO BENEFIT FROM KNOWING WHAT OTHER COMORBIDITIES THOSE PATIENTS HAD. ARE WHAT SOME OF THEIR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WERE- IN ORDER TO PRIORITIZE FOR EXAMPLE CONTACT TRACING OR TO PROVIDE A NECESSARY COMMUNICATION TO THOSE PATIENTS. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM FOR NEEDED TREATMENT. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THERE IT IS- SO HOW DOES THAT SWITCHING GEARS HOW DOES HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THE VERB HAPPEN- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TECHNICAL METHODS I WON'T GO INTO INTO THIS IN GREAT DETAIL OF COURSE TODAY BUT- I THINK AT A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS AND CHOICES AS WELL SO IN GENERAL FROM THE TECHNICAL MODEL POINT OF VIEW THERE'S A SPECTRUM BETWEEN A CENTRALIZED. MODEL OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND- AND A VERY DECENTRALIZED MODEL ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IS A DEPICTION OF A CENTRALIZED MODEL IN WHICH ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISES PARTICIPATING IN PATIENTS CARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE THEIR DATA THEY A COPY THEIR DATA INTO A CENTRAL DATA REPOSITORY AND THERE ARE CENTRALIZED SERVICES FOR MANAGING THOSE DATA AND CONTROLLING ACCESS TO THOSE DATA AND SO FORTH IT'S VERY CENTRALIZED PROCESS SO- JUST- A ROUGHLY THIS IS ANALOGOUS TO A SYSTEM LIKE FACEBOOK WHERE WE ALL WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN A SENSE. BUT ALL OF ITS ALL BEING ORGANIZED BY BY PARTICULAR ENTITY IN THIS CASE THAT'S CONTROLLING THE DATA AND CONTROLLING ACCESS TO THE DATA AND SO FORTH WITHOUT WHICH NONE OF IT COULD HAPPEN. CONVERSELY ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM IS A VERY DECENTRALIZED MODEL WHERE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ON A POINT TO POINT BASIS JUST CONFINING AND COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER AND SENDING INFORMATION THAT THAT THAT- THEY EACH MAY NEED TO CENTER MAY NEED TO ASK FOR AND RECEIVE- AND THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED ENTITY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING IT ALSO THIS IS ROUGHLY AGAIN AND NOW IT IS TO THE EMAIL SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ALL USED TO THERE'S NO BIG. THERE'S NO FACEBOOK FOR EMAIL IT'S JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT EMAIL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE INTERNET BACKBONE THAT ENABLE THE EXCHANGE OF EMAIL AMONG ALL OF US AND HAD FOR A VERY LONG TIME SO THOSE. ARE THE TWO DIFFERENT MODELS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN PRACTICE OF COURSE THERE'S A SPECTRUM. BETWEEN THESE TWO MODELS VERY FEW SYSTEMS ARE AT THE EXTREMES- AND MANY ARE IN THE MIDDLE WITH A PARTS PARTIALLY. PARTIALLY DECENTRALIZED PARTIALLY FEDERATED. MODEL NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO NOMINA TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT. HOW THE HELL THESE MODELS WORK. A LITTLE BIT. WITHOUT GETTING WITHOUT BORING YOU ALL HOPEFULLY I'LL HAVE THE TECHNICAL DETAILS SO THERE'S A DEPICTION OF A FULLY CENTRALIZED AGGREGATED MODEL THE- THE BLUE AREAS ARE THE CENTRALIZED SERVICES. WE SEE HERE THAT IN THIS MODEL AS I MENTIONED DATA FROM VARIOUS HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISES LARGE AND SMALL ARE ACTUALLY SENT TO A COPY TO THE CENTER CENTRAL DATA REPOSITORY WHERE THEY ARE AGGREGATED. ORGANIZED A STANDARDIZED- AND NOT LEAST THE PATIENT'S DATA IS LINKED INTO WHAT'S CALLED A MASTER PATIENT INDEX THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT STEP BECAUSE DIFFERENT HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISES USE DIFFERENT IDENTIFIERS DIFFERENT MEDICAL RECORD NUMBERS DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS TO IDENTIFY THE SAME PATIENTS- SO. IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMPLETE RECORD OF ANY PARTICULAR PATIENT- ALL THE DATA FROM THOSE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE SAME PATIENT NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED AS BEING FOR THE SAME PATIENT NEED TO BE- AGGREGATED AND A MASTER PATIENT INDEX IS A CRITICAL. TECHNICAL COMPONENT FOR DOING THAT. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IN THIS MODEL WHEN A PARTICULAR HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISE WANTS TO ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT A PATIENT THEY DON'T GO TO THE OTHER ENTERPRISES THAT GO TO THE CENTRALIZED RESOURCE IN THIS CASE AND SOME USER INTERFACE OR COMPONENT THERE WHICH- WHICH- REFERENCES THE MASTER PATIENT INDEX MAKE SURE THIS PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THEN THE DATA ARE RETRIEVED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED CENTRAL DATA REPOSITORY. NOW IF ENOUGH HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISES IN A PARTICULAR AREA OR YOU KNOW IDEALLY ALL OF THEM THAT HAVE. MAY HAVE- GENERATED DATA FOR PARTICULAR PATIENT IF THEY ALL CONTRIBUTE. THEIR DATA TO THE CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORY THE REPOSITORY CONFORMANCE WHAT'S CALLED A LONGITUDINAL PATIENT RECORD. FOR ONE ORMANY PATIENTS ACROSS ALL OF THEIR- HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISES. AND THIS IS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT- WENT WHEN IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED- IF IT PRESENTS AS I MENTIONED A NICE CLEAN ORGANIZED FOR VIEW THE DATA. BUT ALSO SUPPORTS- ANALYTICAL FUNCTIONS ACROSS PATIENTS AND ACROSS PROVIDERS WHICH ARE OTHERWISE NOT NOT POSSIBLE OR NOT EASILY POSSIBLE- IF THE DATA REMAINS IN SEPARATED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND WE SEE THAT IN IN LOOKING CONVERSELY AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM AT A FULLY DECENTRALIZED AND FEDERATED MODEL OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE HERE IN THE MIDDLE YOU SEE YOU DON'T SEE A PATIENT DATA REPOSITORY THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED STORAGE FOR THE DATA THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST AS A SET OF STANDARDS AND RULES- BY WHICH THE VARIOUS HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISES EXCHANGE DATA IN A POINT TO POINT MATTER THEY SUBMITTED TO EACH OTHER OR THEY REQUESTED AND RETRIEVE IT FROM EACH OTHER. THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORY MANAGEMENT SO THERE'S NO MASTER PATIENT INDEX HELPING TO- JUDICATA FRIEND REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SAME PATIENTS THERE'S NO DIRECTORY. OF WHICH ORGANIZATIONS OF WHICH PATIENTS DATA- THERE COULD BE DUPLICATE COPIES OF DATA ACROSS DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. IT'S UP TO. EACH ORGANIZATION WHEN THEY RECEIVE THOSE COPIES TO SORT THAT OUT- BUT IN SOME WAYS THEIR ADVANTAGES TO THIS MODEL AS WELL- IN THAT. THERE'S LESS PERCEIVED RISK IN MANY CASES BY THE PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS BY THE HEALTHCARE FUNDS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO YOU. DON'T HAVE THIS SECURITY RISK PRIVACY RISK FOR EXAMPLE OF. OF SENDING ALL OF THEIR PATIENT DATA TO A THIRD PARTY. AND HAVING TO TRUST THAT THIRD PARTY TO PROTECT THAT DATA THERE'S ALSO. LESS BUSINESS RISK PERCEIVED BUSINESS RISK IN THAT IN THAT THEIR PATIENT DATA IS SEEN BY MANY HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS. AS AS A STRATEGIC ASSET AND A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO THEM- AND THERE'S ALSO GEN GENERAL FOR THIS DECENTRALIZED MODEL THEIR LOWER COST OF OPERATING THE MODEL- BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAINTAIN A MASTER PATIENT INDEX AND SOME OF THE OTHER CENTRALIZED. INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES OF THE CENTRALIZED MODEL. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE PROS AND CONS IN THIS MODEL. NOW IN BETWEEN THE TWO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THEN YOU MAY HAVE SEEN UP IN THE LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE SLIDES ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA THAT- HAVE IMPLEMENTED THESE VARIOUS MODELS- SO THE ALL OF THESE MODELS EXIST SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE. SO THIS DOES PARTIALLY CENTRALIZED PARTIALLY FEDERATED MODEL AGAIN INCLUDES INTEL'S NO CENTRALIZED PATIENT DATA REPOSITORY EACH ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO STORE AND MAINTAIN ITS THE DATA ITSELF. AND ONLY SHARE IT ON ON DEMAND ESSENTIALLY WITH WITH THE HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION BUT THERE ARE IN LIKE THAT COMPLETELY DECENTRALIZED MODEL THERE ARE RESOURCES SUCH AS A MASTER PATIENT INDEX. WHAT'S CALLED A PATIENT LOCATOR SERVICE WITH WHICH EACH ORGANIZATION REGISTERS ITS PATIENT DATA THESE ARE SORT OF INDEXES- IN AWARE DIRECTORIES. UP TO HELP GUIDE FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR PARTICULAR PATIENTS DATA WHERE THAT PATIENT WHERE WHERE THAT DATA MAY RESIDE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO AGAIN. UPON REQUESTING INFORMATION A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION CONSULTS THE CENTRALIZED RESOURCE WHICH OUT REFERS TO THE DIRECTORIES IN INDICES IT HAS MAINTAINED AND SO IT KNOWS WHERE WHICH ORGANIZATIONS TO REQUEST DATA FROM NEXT SLIDE. AND THEN THOSE DATA OF COURSE ARE RETRIEVED FROM THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AS AS NEEDED AND- INDIVIDUALLY AND SENT BACK TO THE REQUESTING ENTERPRISE AGAIN AS MENTIONED- THAT THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORIES ALTHOUGH IT'S EASIER TO FIND A PATIENT'S DATA AND GET THE RIGHT PATIENTS DATA TO THIS MODEL. THERE IS STILL LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO- THE TECH DE DUPLICATED DATA TO HAVE TO HAVE THE DATA ALL IN ONE STANDARDIZED FORMAT WHEN IT WHEN IT. IS RETRIEVED ALL AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ANALYZE ACROSS PATIENTS AND ACROSS PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONS EACH HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISE THAT COLLECTS DATA FROM OTHER HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISE IN THIS MANNER MUST STILL DO ALL THAT WORK ITSELF OF AGGREGATING AND ANALYZING THE DATA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WITH THAT- IN A SURVEY OF THE DIFFERENT MODELS- LET'S TURN TO TALKING ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF EXISTING HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENT ONE OR MORE OF THESE MODELS AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES AROUND THE STATE AND THEIR THEIR- THERE IS NO NO SMALL NUMBER OF THEM IN FACT ALREADY OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRST CATEGORY ARE WHAT WE'RE CALLING REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS AND THERE ARE NINE- MAJOR ONES IN THE STATE TODAY. N. AND THEY'RE HIGHLY VARIABLE IN TERMS OF THEIR SIZES AND THE SERVICES THEY OFFER AND VARIOUS OTHER DIMENSIONS THEY ALL PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF ON DEMAND CLINICAL DATA SHARING FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS AND SOME OF THEM PROVIDE OTHER IMPORTANT SERVICES- RELATED TO THAT THE USE CASES THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE SUCH AS A CENTRAL REPOSITORY THAT SUPPORTS. ANALYSIS OR- A POPULATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES OR THESE NOTIFICATION SERVICES WHEN A PATIENT IS DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL OR OR CONNECTION TO SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES AT CETERA. THE SECOND TYPE OF H. IONE CALIFORNIA- OF THOSE THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO INTEGRATED DELIVERY NETWORKS OR OTHER- AGGREGATIONS OF. HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISES THAT ARE IN SOME WITH EACH OTHER THAT HAS INCENTIVIZE THEM TO SHARE DATA AND DAY THESE ARE SOMETIMES CALLED PRIVATE H. I. O.'S- THEY'RE ONLY AVAILABLE TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS IN THIS CLUB AND THIS PARTNERSHIP. AND OUR DATE DAY SHARE THE COSTS OF THIS HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE- INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEN THE THIRD CATEGORY ARE- HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE- HAVE HAVE BEEN CREATED BY OUR AND ARE OPERATED AND GOVERNED BY- CONSORTIA OF VENDORS OR SOMETIMES EVEN INDIVIDUAL VENDORS- THESE INCLUDE. ONCE CALLED CARE QUALITY WHICH HAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF EHR VENDORS THAT IT ENABLES THE SHARING A HEALTH INFORMATION AMONG. COMMON WELL A DIFFERENT ONE WITH SOME OVERLAPPING IN SOME DIFFERENT MEMBERS- THERE'S A PROMINENT LOCAL EPIC CARE EVERYWHERE WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO JUST THE EPIC. EHR VENDOR- AND THERE'S SOME SECURE MESSAGING. INFRASTRUCTURE IN IN PLACE THAT MOST EHRS HAVE SOME CAPABILITY TO LEVERAGE- GENERALLY SPEAKING HOWEVER THESE. IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT THESE NETWORKS IS THAT DAY PROVIDE THEIR SERVICES ARE. GENERALLY SPEAKING AGAIN CONSTRAINED TO JUST ON DEMAND CLINICAL DATA SHARING IN PARTICULAR THE SHARING OF A PARTICULAR KIND OF STANDARDIZED- DATA FORMATTER DOCUMENT THAT CONTAINS A PATIENT MEDICAL. MEDICAL RECORD BUT I BUT THIS IS A ON A ON A PATIENT BY PATIENT BASIS CAN BE RETRIEVED- AGAIN THERE'S IN THESE MODELS THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORY- AND THERE'S- MOST CASES NO NOTIFICATION MANY OF THE OTHER SERVICES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NEXT WE'LL TURN TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE TYPES OF H. IDEAS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE FIRST AMONG THE THOSE REGIONAL H. I. AS A NINE REGIONAL H. IDEAS- THIS IS A OF THE MAPPING OF THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTIONAL REFER PEOPLE TO THAT PROMISE AND PITFALLS REPORTS FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT EACH OF THESE. BOB SO THEY THEY TEND TO BE CLUSTERED IN IN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS- ALTHOUGH THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME OVERLAPS IN GEOGRAPHY FOR EXAMPLE L. A. COUNTY. THERE'S A MADE A PRIMARY- ORIGINAL H. I. O. THERE BUT THERE'S ALSO PARTICIPANTS IN THAT AREA IN IN- H. I WAS OF ADJOINING REGIONS ONE IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS LIGHT IS- THIS DATA AND THIS DEPICTION IS FROM. TWENTY EIGHTEEN A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND SO- THERE THE FOOTPRINT OF THE SOME OF THESE H. I. OWES MAY CERTAINLY HAVE CHANGED EVEN SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED. IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- SO- THAT THIS THIS MADE MAY NOT NECESSARILY TO PICKED UP THE CURRENT STATE OF THE WORLD BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS UP ROUGHLY ACCURATE I WOULD SAY- BASED ON TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WITH RESPECT TO INTEGRATED DELIVERY NETWORKS. ARE THESE ALSO EXISTS IN VARIOUS PARTS AREAS AROUND THE STATE ARE SPREAD AROUND THE STATE ROOM RECALL THESE ARE- PARTNERSHIPS OF HEALTH CARE DISTINCT HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS- THAT HAVE A BUSINESS INCENTIVE TO SHARE DATA. AND YEAH INCLUDING HOSPITAL SYSTEMS- THE SUCH AS THE WELL KNOWN ONES AND ALSO ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH THEY TEND TO BE AND- POPULATION CENTERS AROUND THE STATE. AND ALSO THERE'S SOME OVERLAP AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS MATH VERSUS THE PREVIOUS ONE- THAT THAT SOME ORGANIZATIONS SOME OF THESE IDEA AND H. I. O.'S- ARE IN THE SAME AREAS AS REGIONAL H. I. AS IN EFFECT SOME. SPECIFIC HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISES WILL WILL PARTICIPATE IN BOTH A- A PRIVATE H. I. O. AND A REGIONAL A CHAU. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OF THE SITE SO SOME OF THOSE THE VENDOR GOVERNED AND OPERATED HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ORGANIZATIONS- A- IN FUTURE THESE IS THAT THE REALLY AVAILABLE- THAT THEY'RE NOT REGIONAL. THEY'RE THEY'RE AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE THEY'RE BASED ON BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON TECHNOLOGY CHOICES. OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISES AND A AND- SO THAT THE CONCENTRATION HOWEVER OF THE MEMBERS OF THESE. H. IOS IS- IS HIGHLY VARIABLE IN ANY PARTICULAR CITY COUNTY OR REGION. SO FOR EXAMPLE- TO ENTERPRISES IN SEPARATE CORNERS OF THE STATE'S MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE DATA USING THE CARE QUALITY- NETWORK BECAUSE THEY THEY BOTH USE EHRS THAT ARE IN THAT NETWORK WHERE IS TO HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STREET FROM EACH OTHER IN A PARTICULAR CITY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE THAT NETWORK BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SIMILARLY FOR ANY FOR THESE AND AGAIN SOME ORGANIZATIONS MAY BELONG TO MULTIPLE OF THESE SO THERE'S A REAL MIXING AND MATCHING OF PARTICIPATION AMONG HEALTH CARE ENTERPRISES IN THESE VARIOUS- HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS AVAILABLE IN OUR STATE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE'RE GETTING NEAR THE END. SO SERVING THE SLIDE IS UP OF. THE AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MODELS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. H. I. O.'S ACROSS THE STATE A REAL SMORGASBORD IN FACT OF CHOICES AND EXISTING RESOURCES FOR HEALTH INFORMATION. NEVER THE LESS THERE REMAIN GAPS IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE CAPABILITIES OF PARTICULAR ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA IT MANY ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA FOR VARIETY OF REASONS AT ALL THAT I'LL GO GO OVER NOW NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE FIRST TYPE OF GAP IS WHERE- IN A REGION WHERE THERE IS A REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION UP THERE THERE MAY STILL BE ON AND ARE. OF MANY ORGANIZATIONS TYPICALLY HEALTHCARE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT CANNOT OR DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THAT REGIONAL H. I. O. THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS FOR OUR FOR THIS- SOMETIMES ARE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS. SOMETIMES THEY FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T NEED TO PARTICIPATE AND SO FORTH BUT THE FACT IS- THAT THERE'S NOWHERE IS THERE UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION IN ANY REGIONAL H. I. O. AND THIS IS MORE SO- USUALLY AMONG. AMBULATORY PROVIDERS OUTPATIENT PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HOWEVER OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS I DON'T PARTICIPATE IN A REGIONAL HR THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANY HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE HAVE NO CAPABILITIES BECAUSE IN THOSE SAME REGIONS AS SHOWN IN THESE. OVERLAPPING LAYER DEPICTION OF DIFFERENT HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS OTHER. HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS MAY BE OPERATING THERE AND MEMBERS ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE REGIONAL H. I. O. MAYBE PARTICIPATING IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE. OTHER TYPES AS WELL AS WE CAN SEE HERE IN THIS SLIDE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND AGAIN IN FACT. I'M SORRY PREVIOUS SLIDE. IN FACT AS WE CAN SEE HERE IS THAT THE- IN THE TRUE STATE OF THE WORLD. ORGANISE THEIR SOME ORGANIZATIONS THAT PARTICIPATE IN MULTIPLE OF THESE HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS IN A PARTICULAR REGION. AND SO THAT EXPANDS THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE CAPABILITIES OF ANY PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION SO WE SEE HERE TWO OF THE MEMBERS OF THE REGIONAL H. I. OR ALSO CARE. MEMBERS SO DOES TWO CAN. COMMUNICATE EXCHANGE DATA WITH ANY OTHER CARE QUALITY MEMBERS BUT THE OTHER REGIONAL HR MEMBERS CANNOT AND UP IT UP AT. THE TOP OF ONE OF THE CARE QUALITY MEMBER PARTICIPANTS IS ALSO AN INTEGRATED DELIVERY NETWORK SO THAT ORGANIZATIONS CAN EXCHANGE DATA NOT ONLY WITH THE OTHER CARE QUALITY MEMBERS BUT WITH. THOSE OF THE INTEGRATED LIVER YOU KNOW. THE OTHER IN A GREAT DELIVERY NETWORK MEMBERS CANNOT HOWEVER DO THAT EXCHANGE DATA WITH ANY ANY OTHER NETWORK MEMBERS SO. THERE'S THAT COMP COMPLEXITY AND THE GAPS THAT ARE- ENGENDERED BY THAT AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THEN THE MOST COMMON KIND OF- GAP THAT THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HELLO IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE ONLY GAP IS WHERE THERE'S A REGION. THAT DOESN'T HAVE A REGIONAL H. I. OPERATING IN THAT AREA THIS OP IS OFTEN CALLED THE CORTICAL WHITE SPACE- YOU SEE LITERALLY WHITE SPACE IN THAT MAP OF REGIONAL H. I. AS THAT I SHOWED EARLIER. THAT HAPPENED AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO HEALTH INFORMATION SHARING BY REGIONAL H. I. O. IN THOSE IN THOSE PARTS OF THE STATE. NEVER THE LESS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. THERE CAN BE N. N. OFTEN IS. ALL VERY COMMONLY IS- OTHER MEANS OF. ACHIEVING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGIONAL H. I. L. A THROUGH. H. I. IS LIKE A CARE QUALITY NETWORK INTEGRATE DELIVERY NETWORKS COMMONWEALTH DIRECT MESSAGING AND SO FORTH- AS AS MENTIONED IMPORTANTLY THOUGH. THOSE NETWORKS OFTEN DON'T PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES AS A REGIONAL H. I. L. THEY OFTEN DO NOT HAVE A CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORY THEY OFTEN. DO NOT PROVIDE NOTIFICATION SERVICES AND SO FORTH ESPECIALLY THE CARE QUALITY COMMON WELL IN SECURE MESSAGING INTEGRATE DELIVERY NETWORKS MAY PROVIDE MORE THOSE FEATURES. SO EVEN WHERE THEIR ALTERNATIVES FOR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE TO REGIONALLY CHAU THERE STILL MAY BE GAPS IN THE TYPES OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THAT THAT THOSE ALTERNATIVES PROVIDE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE WHICH IS MY LAST SLIDE. SO SUMMING UP I BY I HOPE I'VE COMMUNICATED TODAY THAT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES VALUABLE WITH RESPECT TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE AT LOWER COSTS AND BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THEY'RE DIFFERENT TECHNICAL MODELS THAT HAVE. IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONLITY AND ALSO A PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS AND THAT THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE- THAT DAD USED USE ONE OR MORE THESE TECHNICAL MODELS SOME IN REGION SOME ACROSS REGIONS- AND OFTEN MANY OF OPERATING THE SAME REGION AT THE SAME TIME YET DESPITE THIS. GAPS REMAIN IN HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISE ABILITY TO EXCHANGE DATA AFFECTED BILLION MEET ALL THOSE USE CASES THAT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE OUTSET. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT'S COMPLICATED TO COMPLICATED AREA- AND- IT WILL REQUIRE COMPLICATED THINKING IN MY OPINION- TO. DEVELOP PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS APPROPRIATE NEEDS- AND THAT GAME IN SUPPORT OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. SO NEXT LAST VERY LAST SLIDE PLEASE. AND I DON'T KNOW FOR TAKING QUESTIONS. YES RIGHT NOW OR AT THE END NO WE WILL GUARANTEE AT QUESTIONS AT THE END SO WITHOUT NO NO CLUE NO. OR WEAK VACATE THE CHAIR FOR THE NEXT SPEAKER. GIVE I THOUGHT WE WERE. WHAT A QUESTION YEAH I THINK IS DOCTOR SUE JANSKY BEFORE YOU GO. COME BACK. COME BACK DOCTOR SUGGESTING. THANK YOU WE DO WANT TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS- IF YOU DON'T IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT- I'M AT TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF A I WOULD WELL NO WE'VE A SISSY AGUIAR-CURRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GEAR CURRY IS HERE AND OUT OF. THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AUTUMN BURKE IS HERE AS WELL DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. PLEASE GO AHEAD WELL MAKE QUICK COMMENT- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT WHEN YOU SAID THE LAST LINE AND THERE WAS IS COMPLICATED. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT ON STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN NOBODY WANTS TO GIVE UP THEIR- PIECE OF THE PIE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THERE ANYONE- ANY OF OUR MEMBERS ATTENDING REMOTELY WHO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS DOCTORS WHO JESSE I DO HAVE I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE GREAT. YOU KNOW AND I WOULD I WOULD ECHO WHICH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY SAID THIS IS THIS IS ABSOLUTELY- VERY COMPLICATED AND WE'RE WE'RE ABOUT AS DEEP IN THE WEEDS YOU GET ON HEARING- WITH THIS AND THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC SO- SO MY QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE- A LITTLE BIT ARE PRETTY DETAILED SO BEAR WITH ME HERE SO. YOU KNOW YOUR PRESENTATION YOU DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A FEDERATED MODEL THE CENTRALIZED MODEL N A HYBRID MODEL IN TERMS OF HOW THE DATA IS MAINTAINED- DO YOU SEE. ANY PARTICULAR ADVANTAGES IN ANY IN IN IN ANY OF THOSE APPROACHES I MEAN WOULD YOU WOULD YOU WERE. COULD YOU CONCEIVABLY RANK THEM OR- AND THAT MAY BE A DIFFICULT THING TO DO BUT- YOU KNOW DO YOU SEE- WHICH YOU YOU KIND OF HIT ON A LITTLE BIT BUT- IF. IF YOU WERE DOES LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY THIS WAY IF YOU WERE TO DIE DESIGN A SYSTEM- HOW WOULD YOU DO IT. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF. DOT I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS THERE I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO RANK THE APPROACHES IN IN A VERY PRACTICAL SENSE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE BEST TARGET- BECAUSE THERE ARE- ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES TO ALL OF THEM THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT ALL NECESSARY TECHNICAL- SO THERE MAY BE ONE MODEL MIGHT PROVIDE THE MOST FUNCTIONALITY FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT IT MIGHT COST THE MOST. OR IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT NOT BE PALATABLE TO ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION WHO YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME TYPE OF MANDATE- IT WOULD NOT ACHIEVE A BROAD ENOUGH PARTICIPATION COULD REALLY CREATE THAT LONGITUDINAL PATIENT RECORD IF THAT WAS YOUR GOAL AND IT MAY BE. MORE FEASIBLE MORE PRACTICAL TO SHOOT FOR- MAYBE LESS DAA SHARING FUNCTIONALITY BUT BROADER PARTICIPATION SO GETTING SOME DATA FROM EVERYONE RATHER THAN- ALL DATA FROM FROM TRYING TO GET ALL DATA FROM FROM A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE MANY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS ALL THOSE TRADE OFFS ARE YOU KNOW. IN IN PLAY AND THOSE ARE- YOU KNOW GET THOSE AT THE COMPLICATED PUBLIC POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE. ABOVE MY PAY GRADE- FROM FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. IN TERMS OF IDEAL. PERSONALLY I FEEL YOU KNOW I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT THE IDEAL IS REALLY TO HAVE A CENTRAL DATA REPOSITORY OF ALL THE PATIENTS STATE AND HAVE A LONGITUDINAL PATIENT. PATIENT RECORD THERE THAT- YOU KNOW ALL ALL RELEVANT AUTHORIZED ORGANIZATIONS AND PROVIDERS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT'S MAINTAINED THAT'S COMPLETE AND MAINTAIN UP TO DATE IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER- SO THAT THERE'S ESSENTIALLY A SINGLE. MEDICAL RECORD FOR EVERY PATIENT IN THE STATE AND THEN YOU CAN DO ALL KINDS OF. ANALYSES AGAINST THAT IT'S NICELY ORGANIZED IT'S VERY EFFICIENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS. EACH D. DUPLICATING AN ORGANIZING AND LINKING PATIENTS- YOU KNOW OF A REDUNDANTLY- SO IN SOME SENSE THAT'S IT THAT'S A THAT'S AN IDEAL BUT WHETHER THAT IS. FEASIBLE FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE REASONS OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S PIECES OF THE PIE IN THE COST OF DOING THAT AND SO FORTH. IS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT QUESTION. THANK YOU I'M CAN YOU CLARIFY- MANIFEST MEDICS MEDICS- CLASSIFICATION AS A REGIONAL H. I. O. IS AS IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED TO ME IT'S A STATE WIDE. H. I. E. WITH PROVIDER PARTICIPANTS IN HIRTY EIGHT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HELP PLANNED LIVES IN EVERY COUNTY MORE THAN A HUNDRED PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS AND CURRENTLY SHARING DATA FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE SO. CAN YOU CLARIFY HOW YOU CLASSIFY THAT. SURE. SURE SO- SO FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTIONED AT THE DATA THAT I'M USING THE CHARACTERIZATIONS THAT I'M USING ARE FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THINGS ARE MOVING FAST SO- MANIFESTS MAY HAVE ENLARGED ITS FOOTPRINT. APPRECIABLY FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I HAVEN'T COLLECTED YOU KNOW DATA WE COLLECTED THE DATA- TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT TODAY I THINK ONE IN DOING SO ONE NEEDS TO CONSIDER- NOT JUST WHETHER A PARTICULAR H. I. O. HAS. YOU KNOW MAY HAVE ONE PARTICIPANT IN. JUST ONE PARTICIPANT FOR EXAMPLE IN A LOT OF COUNTIES- AND WHETHER THAT GIVES IT A STATE WIDE FOOTPRINT BUT BUT REALLY WHAT THE CONCENTRATION OF PARTICIPANTS AND IN THOSE COUNTIES IS AND WHERE THAT H. I. O. HAS A- SUBSTANTIAL CONCENTRATION SUCH THAT ANY PARTICULAR PARTICIPANT. CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT THE PATIENT AT THE NEW PATIENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT IT'S ARRIVED IN THEIR OFFICE THAT DAY THAT DATA FOR THAT PATIENT IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN THE H. I. L. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M FROM UP IN. THE NORTH STATE COUNTY AND THERE'S ONE ORGANIZATION THERE THAT'S PART OF AN H. I. O. FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- BUT NO OTHERS IN THAT REGION MOST OF THE CARE THE PATIENTS SEEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GOING TO BE BY OTHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PROVIDERS. SO IF THEY'RE NOT IN THAT H. I. O. THERE'S A- MORE LIMITED VALUE THEN THERE WOULD BE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT H. I. O. FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S MANY MANY OF THE PART OF THE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE PARTICIPANTS IN THAT H. I. O. SO THE CHANCES THAT- DATA FOR YOU DON'T MORE COMPLETE DATA FOR MY PATIENT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THAT H. I. ARE MUCH HIGHER. SO I'M NOT I'M NOT AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE DATA FOR MANIFEST MEDICS OR ANY OF THE H. I. OWES AS OF TODAY- SO I WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT. JUST FROM UP. SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW IF YOU WILL WHAT WHAT IS THE CONCENTRATION. OF MANIFESTS OR ANY OTHER H. I. OWES- MEMBERSHIP IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. AND WHAT IT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS TYPICALLY USING ARE THEY USING- MULTIPLE WAYS OF IDENTIFYING PATIENTS SO. SO IT I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU KNOW YOU DO A QUERY AND YOU END UP WITH YOU KNOW FORTY SEVEN JOHN SMITH'S AND SO ONLY ONE OF THEM IS. THE REAL JOHN SMITH SO WHAT ARE OR WERE USING MULTIPLE WAYS OF IDENTIFYING THAT PATIENT OR IS THERE A SINGLE ACCEPTED- TRACTOR SOMETHING LIKE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SOMETHING. SO THAT YOU ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE DATA FROM THE RIGHT PATIENT. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND A GREAT QUESTION AND AS YOU KNOW IN THE US AND IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NO. UNIVERSAL PATIENT ID YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL MEDICAL ID LIKE LIKE THERE IT THERE IS IN OTHER COUNTRIES- SO WE RELY ON. USING OTHER EXISTING IDEAS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND NAMES AND DATES OF BIRTH. AND OTHER DATA POINTS- THAT THAT COULD HELP IN THAT AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET FOR THAT SOME ORGANIZATIONS DON'T. DON'T COLLECT EVEN A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE USING THAT. BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THAT IDENTIFIER IN THEIR PATIENT MATCHING ACTIVITIES- SO IT'S SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A MAGIC BULLET FOR THAT ALSO. SOME PATIENTS DON'T HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS- YOU KNOW NEWBORN BABIES AND SMALL CHAU INFANTS IN THE HOSPITAL MAY NOT HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER- YOU KNOW UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS MAY NOT HAVE SO SECURE NUMBER ETCETERA- SO. AGAIN THERE'S NO PERFECT SOLUTION FOR THAT DIFFERENT H. I WAS THERE TO USING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TO DO THIS PATIENT MATCHING IT'S A WHOLE. FIELD OF STUDY AND A WHOLE SUB INDUSTRY ONTO ITSELF TOOLS. FOR HELPING TO IDENTIFY. WHICH WHICH PATIENTS FROM DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE FACT THE SAME PEOPLE BASED ON- YOU KNOW THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY'RE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FROM THOSE ORGANIZATIONS MATCH OR DO NOT MATCH- THERE ARE SOME MORE ADVANCED. TECHNOLOGIES FOR DOING THAT THAT INCORPORATE. OTHER DATA SOURCES LIKE CREDIT BUREAUS AND OTHER PUBLIC DATA SOURCES- TO EXPAND INTO. THE TYPES OF DATA THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR MATCHING FOR EXAMPLE CREDIT BUREAUS MAY HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A PATIENT'S. PERSONS MAIDEN NAME NOT JUST THEIR CURRENT NAME THAT CAN BE USED TO MATCH ACROSS TWO ORGANIZATIONS- WHERE. THEY KNEW IN ONE IS THE PATIENTS MAIDEN NAME IS USING THE OTHER THEIR MARRIED NAME IS USE SO FORTH. SO TO LONG WINDED ANSWER BUT TO SAY THERE'S NO THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTION FOR THAT AND IT REMAINS AN ISSUE. SO THAT THAT MAKES ME WONDER THAN FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF USEFULNESS AND BEING ABLE TO SORT THROUGH SO IF YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE WITH A COMMON NAME. AND YOUR THE PHYSICIAN TRYING TO TRACK TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THE RECORD ON THIS PERSON- YOU KNOW I DO WONDER AT SOME POINT ORG PEOPLE DISCUSS A THE HECK WITH IT I'M JUST GONNA DO THE MRI ANYWAY. BECAUSE I NEED THAT I'M IN THE R. I NEED THIS NOW YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY HAD ONE YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE JOINING HOSPITAL AN HOUR AGO BUT- THIS PATIENTS CRITICAL AND I NEED TO GET THAT INFORMATION NOW SO. SO I DO WONDER YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING QUERIES HERE IF YOU IF YOU'VE GOT TO SORT THROUGH A BUNCH OF INFORMATION AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. AND HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY LEAD TO COST SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCIES. IF THE NEW INFORMATION IS. ISN'T ISN'T AS COHESIVE AS AS WE LIKE TO SEE A. IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT- I GUESS I WOULD SAY WE'RE WE'RE MAYBE IT'S THE SITUATION'S NOT QUITE AS DIRE. AS YOU'RE INDICATING BECAUSE- EVEN JUST UP JUST BASED ON. READILY AVAILABLE DEMOGRAPHICS SUCH AS NAME. AND DATE OF BIRTH AND GENDER POSSIBLY ADDRESS YOU CAN YOU CAN DO. RELATIVELY EFFECTIVE PATIENT MATCHING SO MOST OF THE TIME YOU WILL NOT GET BACK OU KNOW. IN MULTIPLE PATIENT OR NO PATIENCE- WHEN IN FACT YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD FIND JUST ONE MATCHING PATIENT MOST OF THE TIME- IT BY MOST I MEAN YOU KNOW. FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY PLUS PERCENT OF THE TIME YOU YOU WILL GET THE YOU WILL GET. A GOOD MATCH IT'S JUST THAT IT'S STILL IN PERFECT- SO- YOU KNOW PUT A 20% 30% ERROR RATE- IS YOU KNOW IF IT IF IT CREATES MORE WORK FOR A PROVIDER IN THOSE CASES- IS STILL SIGNIFICANT. BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE'S NO VALUE TO THE SYSTEM- BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S HARDLY THE CASE AT ALL I WOULD SAY AS FAR AS PUBLIC POLICY IS CONCERNED IN MY OPINION. YOU KNOW A VERY IMPORTANT AREA. TO HELP WITH HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN GENERAL WOULD BE TO EXPLORE- AN ALTERNATIVE I UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS FOR CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. TO HELP WITH WITH THIS IDENTITY MATCHING TASK TO GET FROM THAT 7080% TO A 100% AND MAKE THE SYSTEM THAT MUCH BETTER. WELL THAT'S GREAT WELL I WASN'T IMPLYING THAT ISN'T OF VALUE I WAS JUST- WELL I WAS JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW HOW OFTEN YOU YOU REALLY GOT A CALL THROUGH A LOT OF INFORMATION- TO GET WHAT IT IS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SO- SO. IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE AND FEELS LIKE IF WE HAD A UNIQUE PATIENT IDENTIFIER- FOR EVERY PERSON I WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW A REALLY HIGH LEVEL OF ACCURACY. YES I WOULD I WOULD AGREE. YOU KNOW AGAIN THAT'S THE THAT'S AN IDEAL BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE. NOT EVERYONE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. AND THERE MAY BE DOUBT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME PERCEIVED DOWNSIDES TO THAT AS WELL- THAT THAT NEED TO BE MANAGED. FROM A TECHNICAL AS WELL AS A PERCEPTION POINT OF VIEW BUT I BUT I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT. IN IN NET PERSONALLY SPEAKING I THINK. IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND- APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE TREK TO OAKLAND TO DO IT. NO PROBLEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GO AHEAD NOW AND MOVE ON TO OUR OUR SECOND SPEAKER. OUR SECOND SPEAKER IS- DR LYNETTE SCOTT. SHE IS THE CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ENTERPRISE DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO- DR SCOTT YOU ARE IF YOU'RE OUT THERE YOU'RE ON. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME OKAY. YES MA'AM. WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH- DOCTOR BUT A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITH OUR PARTNERS. ACROSS THE AGENCY AND ACROSS THE STATE RELATED TO HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. TODAY I'D LIKE TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME- SHARING SOME BACKGROUND AND SOME CONTACT OF OUR WORK. OF MUCH OF OUR WORK IS VERY MUCH ROOTED IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH ACT. WHICH WE MUCH PREFER TO SAY HI TECH SO THE HIGH TECH ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. REALLY HAD A VARIETY OF COMPONENTS AND IN PARTICULAR HOW TO FOCUS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES AND POLICY PRIORITIES. THAT INCLUDEDIMPROVING QUALITY SAFETY EFFICIENCY- OF HEALTHCARE AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES. ENGAGING PATIENTS THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR HEALTH CARE. IMPROVING CARE COORDINATION. IMPROVING POPULATION PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENSURING ADEQUATE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROTECTIONS FOR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION. THESE PRIORITIES WELL INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE NOW OVER A DECADE AGO THEY CONTINUE TO BE THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE WORK AND OUR PURPOSE OF THE WORK ON HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND THE ADOPTION OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA MEDIC HOW. SERVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE OR APPROXIMATELY ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS AND A PART OF THAT. THAT PROGRAM. WE THINK THAT HIGH TECH A LINE WITH ARTICLES TO FOCUS ON PATIENT CENTERED CARE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO PATIENTS SO THAT THEY CAN ENGAGE MEMBERS OF THEIR CARE TEAM. AS WELL AS THE CORONATION OF CARE ACROSS MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM. I PARTICULARLY FOR ON THE HEALTH DELIVERY AND ALSO THAT THE PARTICIPANTS IS A COMMUNITY SERVICES THAT ARE. IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH OF OUR MEMBERS. I KEEP. THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. THE ROLE OF HIGH CAN'T HAPPEN IF TRAIN. FROM A BASED EMPIRE. TO AN ELECTRONIC DATA FIREMEN. WITH THE PARTICULAR ON AND CALL OF CARE. THAT THE COURT IMPROVED VALUE THE RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY JUST THE DOLLARS BUT ALSO THE VALUE OF THE CARE DELIVERED BY HAVING MORE ROBUST INFORMATION WHEN A PROVIDER EIGHTEEN A PATIENT. THIS IS ALSO A LINE WITH A GOAL THAT WE HAVE OF OUR HELPING HIM WITH AGE. WITH THE PRIORITIES WERE SET BY DA CALLER TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN. SERVICES ACROSS OUR CLINICAL FINANCIAL AND SYMPTOMS STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. TO FACILITATE SEAMLESS CARE DELIVERY. AND TIME HAS GONE BY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL LONG BEYOND HIGH TECH AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE. AND SOME OF THE MOST RECENT LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED RELATE TO SECURITY BACKED AND THE MOST RECENT REGULATIONS THAT WERE PASSED THE LAST. SPRING I'M NOT SURE WHEN WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT MORE SO I WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THAT BUT CERTAINLY THE GOALS OF INTEROPERABLE ANY IN CONNECTING PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITIES. ARE IN LINE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. AFTER GOING BACK IN TIME A LITTLE BIT HI TECH- WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED HAD A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THERE WERE THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICES. THAT INCLUDED THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WERE. SPONSORED BY THE OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. OFTEN CALLED IN. THAT INCLUDED THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT PROGRAM THE REGIONAL EXTENSION CENTER PROGRAM THAT THEY CAN POGRAM. AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANT. THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAM THINK. REALLY SET THE STAGE FOR MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY. PART OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT PROGRAM WE ESTABLISHED A STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL PLANS- MUCH OF THAT WORK WITH ORIGINALLY LED BY MR FROLIK WHO WILL BE A PANELIST LATER TODAY- AND WE DID A LOT OF WORK WITH THE VARIOUS TEAMS IN PARTICULAR THE REGIONAL EXTENSION CENTERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE WORKED HAND IN HAND% WITH PROVIDERS TO SHIFTED FROM USING PAPER TO HAVING AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS THAT LEVERAGE LIKE TRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. AND TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. PART OF THE REASON I MENTION IT'S PROGRAMS IS THAT THEY HAVE CARRIED THROUGH AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANKS TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THOSE AND SEE PROGRAMS AND THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AS WELL- IS THAT OUR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN NAMED THE PROMOTING AN OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM- REALLY HAVE THREE CORE COMPONENTS. AND THESE COMPONENTS INCLUDED THE IDEA OF USING A CERTIFIED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. THIS MEANT THAT THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD HAD KEEP FUNCTIONALITY. BEING ABLE TO. SEND AND RECEIVE INFORMATION TO STORE INFORMATION STANDARDIZED WAY TO MANAGE YOU. AND TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT VARIOUS SECURITY AND PRIVACY WORLD. THE SECOND THING WAS THAT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS NEEDED TO RECORD AND PROVIDERS RECEIVING AND SENATE FINANCE RECORDS NAMES FOR YOUTH MEASURES SO DEMONSTRATING OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS COULD BE USED FOR WHAT WE NEEDED TO BEING ABLE TO RECORD THINGS LIKE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT PRESCRIPTIONS IMMUNIZATIONS. ALLERGIES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE CONDITIONS. AND THIRD THE OTHER KEY COMPONENT WHAT'S REPORTING CLINICAL QUALITY MEASURES SO UNDERSTANDING THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT WAS BEING PROVIDED. BY LEVERAGING THOSE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. AND WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD THROUGH TIME THESE HAVE EACH ADVANCED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR BOTH THE MEDICARE AND THE MEDICAID PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS I MENTIONED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CMS THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES CHANGE THE NAME OF THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO PROMOTING INTER OPERABILITY PROGRAM. THIS NAME CHANGE REALLY REPRESENTED A COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING AND PRIORITISING INTER OPERABILITY OF HEALTHCARE DATA. IT MOVES BEYOND THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THE MEANINGFUL USE. AND REALLY DROVE UP FOCUS ON INTERACTIVE BILITY AND IMPROVING PATIENT ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE INFORMATION. THIS SHIFT IS REPRESENTED NOT JUST IN THE NAME CHANGE BUT ALSO THEN AND WHAT WE SEE YOU AGAIN BUT THE NEW RULES THAT WERE RELEASED THAT BLACK BRING UNDER THE CURES ACT- THE NEW INTER OPERABILITY ROLLED BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT MORE LATER WELL. THE MEDICARE LIKE TRY HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND HAS SENT SHIFTED TO BE. A POTENTIALLY HAVING A PENALTY COMPONENT IN TERMS OF A DOWNWARD PAYMENT ADJUSTMENT FOR PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS THAT PARTICIPATE. AND THIS HAS HAS KIND OF CREATED THAT THAT SHIP THE NOT LONG GOING NATURE OF A MEDICARE. HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IN CONTRAST THE MEDICAID ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH RUNS THROUGH SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE REMAINS AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THROUGHOUT. SO WE HAVE BEEN IN THE FORTUNATE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD WITH FEDERAL INCENTIVES TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR YOU'VE GOT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. IN THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL SOME OF THE STATISTICS INCLUDED- BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT- BUT KEY ITEMS NOW AS WELL. SO OUR MEDIC HEALTH PROMOTING INTER OPERABILITY PROGRAM- HAD. BONDING THAT OCCURRED IN TWO WAYS THE FIRST IS THE SENATE THAT ARE PROVIDED TO PROVIDERS AND HOSPITAL WHICH REPRESENT A SECOND OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM WHICH IS FUNDED 990% WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AND 10% BUT STATE OR NON FEDERAL FUNDS. THANK AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM AND THE TEMPER TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE ARE RAPIDLY APPROACHING THAT TIME PERIOD- IN TERMS OF THE TIME PERIOD TO CLOSE THINGS OUT WE HAVE UNTIL DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO FINISH INSIDE OF PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS. AND THEN- THERE IS- ANY ADDITIONAL I TIME FOR A MINUTE STRAIGHT UP CAUGHT. THREE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AUDIT AN APPEAL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE. TO DATE IN TERMS OF OUR ELIGIBLE PROVIDER PAYMENT WE HAVE OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNIQUE PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN OVER ONE THOUSAND UNIQUE FRIEDMAN CLINICS. THAT HAVE RECEIVED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THEIR WORK WITH ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS THAT RECEIVED. OVER EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND SENATE. THE REPRESENTS ON ORDER OF POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FEDERAL THAT GO DIRECTLY TO OUR PROVIDE AND HOW IN THE- OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. TO ADVANCE THEIR GET ELECT HEALTH RECORD. ONE MILLION FORWARD AT THE POINT IN TIME. THERE THERE REALLY IS SUCH A IN FOCUS ON NOW THAT YOU IN A LOT. HEALTH RECORD HOW DO WE BOTH YOU IT AND HOW. IT SO WE HAVE THAT INTER OPERABILITY. THAT IS SUPPORTED HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES AND OTHER PRACTICES THAT DOCTOR TO CHANCE HE TALKED ABOUT. SO THERE ARE NUMBER PROGRAM THAT WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. ENHANCED FUNDING BUT 90% FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP SUPPORT THE- WORK IT MADE FORWARD. TWO PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY MANAGED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SERVICESINCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE RACIAL TENSION CENTER THAT WORKED WITH PROVIDERS TO ADOPT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. AND SHOW MOVED THROUGH THE MEANINGFUL USE STAGE IS. AND THEY WORKED- TO ACHIEVE THOSE FEDERAL SENATE. FOR THE CALIFORNIA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM RAN FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. AND WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH OVER SEVENTY APPROXIMATELY. SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE STATE. THE SECOND PROGRAM AT THE THAT WE HAVE RUNNING NOW WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INFORMATION CHANGE ONBOARDING PROGRAM OR CAL HOCK. AND THIS PROGRAM IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON- ONBOARDING HOSPITAL PROVIDER PRACTICES TO HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION AND IN DOING SO HELPING TO SUPPORT THE INTERFACES NECESSARY FOR VARIOUS KINDS OF ACCORDING. TO THE STATE- TO SYSTEM SUCH AS YOURS CONTROLLED-SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION SYSTEM- AS WELL AS SYSTEM SUCH AS THE CAL READY SYSTEM FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE REPORTING- AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHERPROVIDERS THAT THEY ARE- TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN. SO THE CAL HARPER AGAIN VERY APPRECIATE A FIVE MILLION AND EIGHT THAT WAS. BUDGETED THE WHERE YOU'RE A TO MATCH WITH FORTY FIVE MILLION IN BETTER FUNDING. AND THAT WE WILL BE WORKING WITH- CURRENTLY SEVEN AND WE ARE WORKING WITH SEVEN QUALIFIED HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION- THAT ARE WORKING ACROSS THE STATE. TO ADVANCE THE- AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS THAT ARE BEING USED BY PROVIDERS AS WELL AS WITH- OTHER REPORTING ENTITIES THAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH. IN ADDITION TO THE TO PROTEST TO PROGRAMS THAT HAD BEEN ADMINISTERED DIRECTLY BY HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH OUR OUR FUTURE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE SIMILAR KINDS OF PROGRAMS IN OTHER WAYS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH LIMITED MARKETING MEDICAL SERVICES ACCORDING TO IMPLEMENT THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC I FIFTY FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ARE HIGH TOWN. AND THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS SPECIFICALLY A FIFTEEN THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND HOSPITAL- INTERWORKING WITH HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES. AND THEY'VE ALSO PARTICULARLY WORKED WITH THE PATIENT UNIFIED LOOKUP SYSTEM FOR EMERGENCIES OR PAUL. WHICH ALLOWS FOR PATIENT RECORD CRANE DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS- THE PULSE SYSTEM HAD BEEN ACTIVATED DURING SEVERAL OF THE FIRES. THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE ALL BEEN WORKING WITH THE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND OF FUNDING. THAT HAD BEEN ABLE TO HELP SUPPORT UPDATE THE CALIFORNIA STATION REGISTRY AS WELL AS ON BOARDING PROVIDERS TO THE- CALIFORNIA RECORDABLE DISEASE INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACCOUNT READY TO FACILITATE ELECTRONIC THE BEACH ACCORDING. AND FINALLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ALSO WITH OUR CALGARY OFFICE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADVANCEMENT OF THE STATE'S HEALTH INFORMATION GUIDANCE. WOULD HELP ADDRESS THE POLICY AND LEGAL ISSUES THAT PEOPLE RUN INTO AND WHEN EXCHANGING DATA THAT THE- THAT NATURE. WE HAVE WORK TO WITH THE DIFFERENT PARTS AND DIFFERENT PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE IN THE PAST NOW OVER TEN YEARS. CALIFORNIA HAS ATTRACTED PROJECTED THAT HAD OF VERY DIVERSE LANDSCAPE OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACROSS THE STATE WE REALLY ARE A NETWORK OF NETWORK- THAT SUPPORT THE INTER OPERABILITY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. PART OF OUR APPROACH AS WE HAVE DONE THIS- WE INITIALLY LOOKED AT OPTIONS AROUND HAVING STATEWIDE OR STATE LEVEL OUR SERVICES AS PART OF OUR H. I. A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT BACK IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN TWENTY TWELVE TIME FRAME. AT THAT POINT IN TIME NO WE- DECIDED NOT TO MOVE FORWARD- AND INSTEAD PROVIDED FUNDING AND SUPPORT TO DEVELOPSHARED PROPERTIES FOR EXCHANGING DATA IN CALIFORNIA. TO PARTICULAR- ITEMS THAT EMERGED FROM THAT AND HAVE CONTINUED ARE THE CHARACTERS OVER THE CALIFORNIA DATA USE AND RECIPROCAL SUPPORT AGREEMENT. SOMETHING OF A MOUTHFUL- BUT THE COUNTER STUFF IS THE AND BASICALLY MULTIPARTY DATA SHARING AGREEMENT SO IT'S WHICH IS COMMON POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR TRUSTED STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. IT IS THE DATA SHARING AGREEMENT BUT THAT IS THE COMPANY BY THE TENER CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC CHANGE NETWORK WHICH REALLY FOCUSES ON THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR EXCHANGING DATA BETWEEN ORGANISATIONS. AND HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION. IN TURN OF THE CHARACTER AND THE TEN BASED OKAY OF DOC. IN A PAIR PROPERTIES THAT GUY. DATA EXCHANGE AND OUR SUPPORT BY THE BUT OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE OKAY HI AND THOSE YOUTH OF THOSE HAVE REQUIRE TO PART OF THE CALIFORNIA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THE CALVET PROGRAMS THAT THE AGENCY HAS ADMINISTERED. AND WE ARE CAN TO WORK WITH OUR VARIOUS HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES AND THAT THE QUALIFIED H. I. OWES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ACTIVE IS. WHAT ARE THE SOME OF THE POLICY DRIVERS THAT HELP. AND SUPPORT THE NEED FOR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE- BEEN MOVING FORWARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. INCLUDE VARIOUS- PROGRAMS TO DRIVE INTEGRATION ACROSS DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT. SO SOME OF OUR SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES INCLUDE PUBLIC HEALTH IF YOU CAN THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL REDESIGN AND SEVEN MEDIC CAL OR PRIME PROGRAM. WORKING WITH OUR- PUBLIC HOSPITALS THE WHOLE PERSON CARE- THERE'S BOTH THE CLINICAL DATA EXCHANGE WITH THE COURT THAT THE CARE SYSTEM WAIVER AND WHICH WERE DIRECTLY ON FOURTEEN TO HELP INFORMATION ORGANIZATION TO BE ABLE TO KOREAN EXCHANGE DATA. AND THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED INVADING MEDIC HOW- BALL AND THAT. PARTY IT REALLY REPRESENTS THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE LOOKING TO INTEGRATE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE AND TO SUPPORT QUALITY. OUTCOMES FOR MEDIC CAL MEMBERS. REMOVE FORWARD WILL BE. ON IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE. OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CURES ACT AND THEY INTERPRET THE RULES. AGAIN MISTER WHEN WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT FURTHER BUT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT CAME OUT IN THE WORLD TAT BLOCK NAY- THAT PARTICULARLY APPLIES FOR MEDICAID PROGRAM. THOSE INCLUDE FOCUSING ON BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENTED A STANDARDS BASED HAITIAN ACTOR ACT API OR APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE SUPPORTING AND MONITORING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO TEAR PAYER HERE TO CATER GIVE ME PAYER TO PAYER DATA EXCHANGE- WHICH REALLY USES STANDARD- AND FOCUSES ON THE U. S. COURT DATA FOR INTER OPERABILITY STANDARD AS A WAY TO EXCHANGE DATA AND HELP CREATE MORE CONSISTENCY. ALSO IN TERMS OF MAKING INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT PROVIDER NETWORKS USING SPECIFICALLY YEAH FIREBASE- API FIRE IN THIS CASE STANDS FOR FAST HEALTHCARE IN OUR FACILITY REPORT. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY I. THE EXPERIENCE FOR DOING ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS BY THE EXCHANGE TREATMENT WITH OUR STATE PARTNER. WE ALSO WILL BE LOOKING CLOSE AT THE TWENTY THIRD CENTURY BACK BY A LOW FROM UP OUT OF CORE THAT AFFECTED ON PUBLIC. INFORMATION BLOCKING INDEFINITE RELATE TO HELP NETWORK. SO IN TERMS OF OUR NEXT STEP OVER THE YEAR WE ARE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON THE DELIVERY OF THE CAL POLY PROGRAM AND WORKING WITH OUR QUALIFIED AGE I OWN. OUR HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION TO REALLY SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP DECREASE THAT WHITE SPACE THE DOCTORS THE CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT. FOCUSING ON ONBOARDING CONNECTING YOUR PROVIDERS AS WELL IT'S PRETTY MORE CONNECTIVITY FOR PROVIDERS THAT ARE ALREADY PARTICIPATING IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES. WILL BE WERE ON. REQUIRED AS PART OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CURES ACT. AND THEN WE WILL ALSO BE SHIFTING HERE TO WORK ON- UPDATING OUR STATE MEDICAID HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLAN. THIS PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT WAS ESTABLISHED INITIALLY OVER TEN YEARS AGO A PART OF THE INPUT. I REALLY IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM. AND IT'S PART OF THE CLOSE OUT OF THE PROGRAM NOW TEN YEARS LATER. ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS AS FAR AS TO UPDATE THE PROGRAM WITH THE LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPER TO BE PLANNED FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THIS I DUE TO THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL BE FOCUSED ON DURING TWENTY TWENTY ONE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS- TO HELP SUPPORT THAT IF IT IS A VERY ROBUST- DOCUMENTED ROBUST. PLANNED ADDITIONALLY IF WE FORWARD WHERE WE'RE LOOKING HOW WE CAN LIVE HEALTH INFORMATION POLICY TECHNOLOGY HELP ME CHECK SHE CHURCH ARE VERY PROGRAMS. GOALS INCLUDE PAGE ENGAGEMENT AND ACCESS TO THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION. BUT SHE MEAN HIGH QUALITY CARE AND PATIENT OUTCOMES AND SUPPORTING THE INTEGRATION WITH SERVICES THAT PUT PEOPLE AT THE CENTER OF THEIR HEALTHCARE AND THEIR SOCIAL NEEDS. SO I WILL STOP THERE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TIME TO SHARE THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING- WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR SCOTT- QUESTIONS- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AGAIN COMPLEX ISSUE- I'M JUST GONNA I THINK YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR YOU- THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE OUT BOARDING PROGRAM WAS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OVER TWO YEARS AGO IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STATE BUDGET. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING IN FORTY FIVE MILLION A FEDERAL DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE IT'S X. GOING TO EXPIRE THIS NEXT YEAR- WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR CALVET UP AND RUNNING AND IS THERE ANY PLAN TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM I THINK YOU SAID IT WAS BUT I COULDN'T HEAR YOU. I APOLOGIZE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION- SO IN TERMS OF THE TIME IT TOOK TO GET THINGS. STARTED A LOT OF THAT TIME I WASN'T. INVOLVED IN WORKING WITH OUR OUR PARTNERS TO ESTABLISH THE GUARDRAILS FOR THE PROGRAM- AS WELL AS TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE AMERICAN TERMS OF HAVING THE PROVED- AND- AS WE WORK ON DELIVERING THE FUNDS TO THE- THAT QUALIFIED HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS- WE HAVE- MODEL BACK PROGRAM AFTER. OTHER PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE RETENTION CENTER FOR THE CALIFORNIA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- WE DID RECEIVE A APPROVAL FOR THE PROGRAM FROM CMS. BLOCKED OF FEBRUARY- AND WE HAVE- NOW EXECUTED CONTRACTS- WITH THE DIFFERENT QUALIFIED HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION. AND ARE WORKING ON- RECEIVING A PROCESSING INVOICES FROM THEM FOR THE INITIAL WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE- WE DO- CONTINUE TO EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- OVER THE- NEXT YEAR- BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT WE HAVE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE URGENCY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SUPPORT. THAT. DOES WORK ACROSS THE STATE. I THINK WHAT THE FIRST THAT I HAVE AND I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE A IT ALL TECHNICAL CHANGES INNOVATION CHANGES ALL THE TIME REQUIREMENTS THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE ASK YOU TO DO AND CHANGE. MAKE SURE JOB REALLY DIFFICULT. AND IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF TIME I'M CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T TO BE BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL AS OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE KNOW. NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS EDV WERE BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL ON THAT WE DIDN'T GET OUR- SOFTWARE UPGRADED AND DO THAT. YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND SO I DON'T WANT TO LET THE VIEW HIGH AND DRY SO- THANK YOU FOR YOUR- INFORMATION TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENT. IN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM HERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS REMOTELY NOT NINE SO OKAY I'VE GOT A COUPLE- AND PERSONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE- OBVIOUSLY OVER THE LAST DECADE WE SPENT A LOT OF RESOURCES- HERE. HOW ARE WE DOING I MEAN. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS THE UPTAKE- AND- AND THE PROGRESS JUST A GENERAL STATEMENT YOU KNOW GOOD FAIR. POOR I MEAN HOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO OVERALL ASSESS WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS. AT THE RISK OF BEING- HALF FULL PERSPECTIVE. I ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL YOU KNOW THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS A CHALLENGING THING IT IS NOT SIMPLE- REALLY I THINK THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE HIGH TECH PROGRAM. IT REALLY TOOK THAT TIME TO GET THE ADOPTION OF A LIKE HOT LIKE CHRONIC HEALTH RECORDS TO THE POINT THAT WE COULD HIT SOMETHING OF A TIPPING POINT AROUND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND ROBERT BILITY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MANY OF US- NOTICED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE HIGH TECH PROGRAM THROUGH THE ONC THAT ENDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN- MANY OF US THOUGHT THE THOUGHT WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN GREAT IF THE HIV COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT STARTED NOW NOW THAT WE HAVE ADOPTION OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WASN'T THE WAY THE TIMING WORKED- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS- IN TERMS OF CONNECTIVITY AND INTER OPERABILITY. AND SO YES WE STILL HAVE A WITH NOT QUITE A WAYS TO GO BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE INCREDIBLE STRIDES- I REMEMBER THE POINT IN TIME THAT SOMEBODY SAID YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FIRST PERSON GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT NEVER TOUCHED A PIECE OF PAPER- YOU KNOW FOR THAT TO BE AN ACHIEVEMENT IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IT'S TAKING UP TIME TO REALLY CHANGE IN ADVANCE. HOW WE INTEGRATE CARE WITH- INTER OPERABILITY AND HELP INFORMATION CHANGE THAT BEING SAID- I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A VERY STRONG COMMITMENT FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE AND THE NEW INTER OPERABILITY ROLES THAT WERE ISSUED THE BOX MARKED ME- REALLY ECHO THAT. WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE HEARING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DROPPED- PROPOSED RULE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD FROM BOTH OUR CMS AND OUR OWN THE PARTNERS WHAT THAT DOES THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE RULES COMING TO YOU ABOUT INTER OPERABILITY THIS IS THE BEGINNING THEY SAW THIS AT THE BEGINNING OF A REAL PUSH OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS TO REALLY INCREASE THOSE REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT WE CAN SEE THE BENEFITS THAT WE ORIGINALLY STARTED OUT TO WORK ON YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO- SO I THINK I THINK WHERE WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WE'RE DEFINITELY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- BUT THERE'S WORK AHEAD OF US AS- YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH. TODAY THINGS LIKE THE- THAT. IDENTIFY HOW DO THAT. HOW WE DO THAT OCCUR THE NUMBER AND THAT WERE. IS A KEY ISSUE AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO. I YOU KNOW HOW THAT STANDARD BASED COME. THAT REALLY AGAIN IT'S CONTINUE TO ADVANCE- THROUGH THE VARIOUS FEDERAL ROLES AS WELL. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- YOU KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT EXPANDING THESE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE TO INVOLVE SOME BY WHAT I CONSIDER NONTRADITIONAL PROVIDERS THINGS LIKE- FOOD BANKS OR HOUSING AGENCIES TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. I MEAN THERE IS CERTAINLY YOU COULD YOU THEY COULD HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO SOME OF THE INFORMATION BUT BUT THE INTEGRATION OF HEALTH SERVICES IS A CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE NEW CALLIN PROGRAM SO. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON ON HOW THAT MIGHT. PLAY INTO THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE- COMPONENT. YES I'M CERTAINLY THAT THAT IS A KEY PIECE- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST- SEVERAL YEARS BOTH WITH THINGS LIKE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER EXAMPLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY- GENTLY AS PART OF OUR- WHOLE WHOLE PERSON CARE- PILOT AS WELL- IT REALLY HITS ON THAT NEED TO EXCHANGE DATA NOT NOT JUST BETWEEN PERHAPS YOUR TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. ACROSS THE SPECTRUM SUPPORTING THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS THAT INCLUDES NOT JUST- MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS BUT HOUSING- SOCIAL SUPPORT AND OTHER OTHER SUPPORT AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE STATE HEALTH INFORMATION GUIDANCE THAT I MENTIONED- THE SHEIK. THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY THE OFFICE HEALTH INFORMATION INTEGRITY ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THERE WAS ACTUALLY THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF ISSUE IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE DO MORE INTEGRATION ACROSS- DIFFERENT. PARTNERS THAT ARE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU FOR PARTICIPATING WITH US AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO- MORE PROGRESS OBVIOUSLY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- AT WHAT RATE THANK YOU. COURSE WE'RE GONNA MOVE NECK ONTO OUR NEXT SPEAKER- ON A SPEAKERS. QUAL WHEN- FROM OAKLAND- MISTER WHEN IS- THE CEO FOR CAYENNE CONSULTING. THE AUTHOR OF UNDERSTANDING THE NEW FEDERAL DATA INTEROP INTER OPERABILITY REQUIREMENTS SO. MISTER NGUYEN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HI THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- SO I'M HERE TO. SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE NEW- FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO DATA. SHARING CAN HELP INFORM SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA DISCUSSIONS TODAY SO NEXT LIKE. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR- TO FEDERAL AGENCIES- THE SENATE FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICES CMS AND THE OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ONC BIG THEY RELEASED CHIU REGULATIONS- TOGETHER- AND IF YOU HEARD FROM DOCTORS GOD SOMETIMES THEY'RE CALLED. THE INNER ROCK THE DAILY RULE A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CURES ACT SORT OF TOGETHER THEIR RESEARCH THE RELEASE ON THE SAME DAY AND THEY HAVE OVERLAPPING AND SORT OF COMPLEMENTARY- REQUIREMENTS BUT THAT THE MAIN GOAL OF THE THESE REGULATIONS ARE TO MAKE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PATIENTS- PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS. TO ACCESS. EXCHANGE AND USE ELECTRONIC HEALTH INFORMATION. NOW THE REGULATIONS WHEN THEY CAME OUT ARE TWO THOUSAND PAGES. AND NEARLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED COUNT PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE SUBMITTED SO THERE ARE A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS AND I'M GONNA USE MY FIFTEEN MINUTES HERE JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW I THINK THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT TO THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING. SO I'M NOT GOING TO COVER ALL OF THEM. BUT THEY ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND- IMPACT A BIG PORTION OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY NEXT SLIDE. SO BEFORE I GET TO THE REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE TO CALIFORNIA- EDGE I DO WANT TO SPEND EQUIPMENT ON YOU KNOW WHO'S IMPACTED AND WHO HAS OVERSIGHT OF SOME OF THESE REGULATIONS. SO FOR CMS- THESE REGULATIONS GOING TO BE IMPACTING A LOT OF HEALTH PLANS. PROVIDERS IN STATES. OPTICALLY THOSE THAT PARTICIPATE IN CMS PROGRAMS- WHICH ON MEDICAID. MEDICARE AND THE INDIVIDUAL- EXCHANGE MARKET PLACE. FOR ONC THEY HAVE OVERSIGHT- OVER HEALTH I. T. THEY CERTIFY- I. T. SYSTEMS ESSENTIAL EHRS THAT PROVIDERS USE TO STORE THEIR CLINICAL DATA. SO ESSENTIALLY BY A SORT OF AN INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP ONC HAS IS SORT OF IMPACTS OF PROVIDERS BECAUSE PROVIDERS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO USE CERTIFIED IT SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN SENTENCE IN THE MEDICARE MEDICAID PROGRAM. SO A LOT OF THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN BOTH THE CMS RULE IN THE ONC RULE REALLY GETTING AT A COMBINATION OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY NEXT LIKE. SO WHAT WHAT DO THE REGULATIONS DUE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PATIENTS PROVIDERS HEALTH PLANS TO SHARE ACCESS SHARE AND USE HEALTHCARE DATA. THE REGULATIONS AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF AND I CAN I'M NOT GOING TO COVER ALL OF THEM BUT I THINK THE THREE MAIN ONES TEND TO KNOW ABOUT AND BE AWARE OF AS THE STATE SO CONTEMPLATES THESE- YOU KNOW. HEALTH DATA EXCHANGE OPTIONS IS THREE THAT THAT ARE COVERED IN IN THE REGULATION THE SUN'S LIGHT FOR THAT THE THREE ARE. ONE DATA EXCHANGE THEY ARE REQUIRING VERY SPECIFIC- ENTITIES TO SHARE DATA CERTAIN DATA WITH. EACH OTHER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE ALSO WHEN DATA IS BEING EXCHANGED- THEY ARE PUTTING IN PLACE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THOSE TWO ENTITIES THE ORGANIZATION THAT IS SENDING THE DATA AND THE ORGANIZATION THAT'S RECEIVING THE DATA THEY CAN DO THAT IN A VERY SEAMLESS WAY. ON SO THAT WITHOUT A LOT OF EFFORT AND CURRENT STATE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW GETTING DATA FROM ANOTHER SYSTEM CAN TAKE MONTHS OF JUST IMPLEMENTATION WORK. THE THIRD ONE WHICH I'M NOT GONNA SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON BUT IS A BIG. PART OF THE REGULATION IS- RELATING TO INFORMATION BLOCKING WHERE. CMS AND ONC ARE ESSENTIALLY PREVENTING. OUR PROVIDERS AND VENDORS OF HEALTH SYSTEMS- TO- NOT BLOCK- PATIENT OR PROVIDER REQUESTS FOR HEALTHCARE INFORMATION SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DEFINITIONS AND EXEMPTIONS. TO IT BUT A SAN IF THERE IS A DATA EXCHANGE AND ANIONS BEING REQUESTED THAT THEY CAN BE SUPPORTED. SOMEONE SPEND MY TIME ON THE NOTION OF DATA EXCHANGE AND AN IMPROBABILITY WHERE IT'S EASY FOR TWO SYSTEMS WHO DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER. MY PRIOR EXPERIENCE TO CONNECT AND SHARE THAT DATA. SO THERE'S FIVE TEAMS I KIND OF COME OUT AND I AND I THINK FOR THE TAKE AWAY FOR. AND LEGISLATOR AND THE AUDIENCE- I THINK AS YOU APPROACH THIS DISCUSSION IS THE APPROACH THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS USED. WHICH. THE CONSUMERS ACTUALLY AT THE CENTER OF THIS HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. THEY ARE MANDATING PARTICIPATION FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY CAN REGULATE SO IT'S NOT VOLUNTARY. ANDFOR DATA IN A ROCKET BILITY THEY ARE IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC COMMON STANDARDS AND THE USE OF A CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES SOMEONE OF EACH OF THOSE NEXT. SO NEXT LIGHT SO AND I THINK AN EASY WAY TO HELP EXPLAIN WHAT. IS THIS IN A RAPIDLY RULE IS TO GO OVER USE CASE AND TAKE IT FROM THE USER PERSPECTIVE. SO IF I ASKED YOU- IF YOU WENT TO YOUR PROVIDER YOUR HEALTH PLAN AND ASK THEM. I'D LIKE A COPY OF MY HEALTH RECORD HEALTH INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE ON. THE RESPONSE YOU TYPICALLY WILL GET TODAY IS THE MAY GIVE YOU A PRINT OUT. THAT IS PRETTY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OR PDF VERSION OF THAT PRINT OUT THEY MAY GIVE YOU EVEN A CD OR USB DRIVE WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION. AND IN SOME CASES THEY WILL- DIRECT YOU TO AN ONLINE PORTAL THAT THEY HAD THAT YOU CAN SIGN INTO AND HAS A COLLECTION OF ALL YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION BUT THAT PROVIDER WHAT WITH THAT HEALTH PLAN. WHAT THE REGULATION IS ACTUALLY GETTING OUT IS ENABLING THE ABILITY SO THE FOR THE FUTURE IS THAT ANY CONSUMER PATIENT HAS THE BILL TO ACCESS ALL THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE. IN THAT ONE PLACE IS ESSENTIALLY THE SMARTPHONE. IT IS A MOBILE PHONE. N. THAT MEANS PROVIDERS AND OR HEALTH PLANS WE HAVE INFORMATION ON A CONSUMER PATIENT. IF THAT CONSUMER DOWNLOAD AN APP ON THEIR PHONE TELLS THAT APT. TO REQUEST THAT INFORMATION FROM THE HEALTH PLAN OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THAT REQUEST AFTER CONSENT IS CONFIRMED THAT THOSE OLD HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS WILL SEND THAT INFORMATION. TO THAT THIRD PARTY APPS IN THE CONSUMER THEN ESSENTIALLY THE USE CASE THAT IS THAT IS BEING OFFERED IS THEY WILL GOAL TO THEIR PROVIDER OR DOCTOR DOING IT IS IT. PULL OUT THE PHONE AND SHOW THEM HERE MY MEDICATIONS FOR MY PROCEDURES HERE ARE YOU KNOW THINGS THAT MY CONDITIONS FOR MY PREVIOUS HEALTH CARE VISITS SO THAT IS THE SPECIFIC USE CASE. THAT IS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS. AND THAT'S BOTH A HOLISTIC VIEW FROM ANY PROVIDER ANY HEALTH HAZARDS LIKE GNOSTIC AND HAS ALLOWED ME TO NO RECORD SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN HAVE OVER MANY YEARS YOU KNOW AS PEOPLE CHANGE HEALTH PLANS THEY THEY GO VISIT MULTIPLE PROVIDERS. IT'S ALL CENTRALIZED IN ONE PLACE AND THAT'S. REALLY THE TARGET IS ON THE SMARTPHONE. I NEXT PLEASE. SO BECAUSE IT'S CONSUMER DIRECTED IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THE FEATHER IN ABOUT THE DELAYED A RULE A BIG PORTION OF IT IS ESSENTIALLY A CONSUMER. DIRECTED DATA EXCHANGE I THINK DUCT SUE JANSKY YOU KNOW HIGHLIGHTS DIFFERENT MY- OF A HEALTH KNOW INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN THE FEDERAL RULE IT'S THE PERSON IN THE MOBILE PHONE THAT'S THE CENTER OF THE MODEL WHERE ALL THE DATA SOURCES ARE COULD BE FROM A PAYER PROVIDER COULD BE FROM A WEARABLE DEVICE LIKE A FITBIT. THAT COULD BE FROM A PHARMACY OR LAB. IT COMES TO THE CONSUMER AT THEIR DIRECTION. THEY CAN USE IT HOWEVER THEY WANT AND THEY CAN SHARE IT. YOU KNOW TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS TO ANY OTHER ENTITY COULD BE ANOTHER PROVIDER KNOW THEHEALTH PLAN. HOWEVER THEY CHOOSE A COULD BE- TO YOU KNOW OFF OUR BIOTECH COMPANY FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. SO THAT THAT THE CORE OF IT IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL. AND THEIR PHONE WILL BE BACK STANCHION IS. THE DATA EXCHANGE MODEL. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW NEXT SLIDE IS MAYBE JUST TO COVER A COUPLE MORE THE USE CASES AND JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS. SO HERE WHAT I HAVE INDIVIDUAL IS- FOUR OF THESE CASES THE MIDDLE COLUMN. IS A SOME OF THE DATA REQUIREMENT THAT'S BEING EXCHANGED AS PART OF THAT THAT FROM THE SENDER TO THE RECEIVER. AND THEN WHETHER THAT REQUIRES CONSUMER CONSENT OR NOT. SO THE FIRST ONE TO AS UNDER THAT SAME BUCKET I JUST DESCRIBED WHERE A PATIENT YOU KNOW HROUGH THEIR APP CAN REQUEST THEIR HEALTHCARE INFORMATION IT CAN BE DOWNLOADED ESSENTIALLY WITHIN SECONDS. AND THAT DATA BUNDLE YOU KNOW INCLUDE ALL CLAIMS ENCOUNTERS CLINICAL DATA. YOU FROM THE HEALTH PLAN IT'S ALSO THERE FOR MILITARY CAMP PROVIDER NETWORK SO THE PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THEIR HEALTH PLAN. THE OTHER TWO IF I CAN JUST REALLY BRIEFLY THE- THE ADDITIONAL USE CASES THAT ARE PROMINENT IN THE REGULATION- NUMBER THREE HERE THAT'S LISTED IS- I CARE TRANSITION WHEN A PERSON INVOLVED IN A NEW HEALTH PLAN. SO AT MY NOW IF YOU GO TO ENROLL IN A NEW HEALTH PLAN THAT NEW HEALTH PLAN ESSENTIALLY DOESN'T GET ANY DATA FROM ALL YOUR PRIOR HISTORY FROM YOUR PREVIOUS HEALTH PLAN. IN YOUR TREATED AS A PERSON AS PRETTY MUCH NO HISTORY AND THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU UNTIL THEY SEE CLAIMS AN ACCOUNT IS- YOU KNOW FROM PROVIDERS. AND IN THIS NEW RULE THE CONSUMER CAN REQUEST THE OLD HELPING THAT THE COMING FROM. ST TO THE NEW HEALTH PLAN. THURMOND THEY ARE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION BEHALF SO THAT NEW HEALTH. CARE PLAN INSTEAD OF JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN- THEY CAN IDENTIFY- YOUR YOUR CURRENT AUTHORIZED SERVICES THE MEDICATIONS YOU'RE TAKING SO ESSENTIALLY CHORE COTTON WE KISS IN THIS NO GAPS. BUT THEY CAN ALSO IDENTIFY- ANY KIND OF RESOURCES AND HOW TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL YES I SIGNED A ONE WHAT DISEASES- OR CONDITIONS MAY HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW COULD BE HEALTH EDUCATION OR ANY PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR. SO THAT THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC USE CASE- THE FOURTH ONE IS ONE THAT REALLY TARGETS HOSPITALS- IN THIS ONE IS AND SUCH DOCTORS THE CHANTING OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THIS. WHERE A CONSUMER. WHO OUR PATIENT AND GO TO HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL THAN NOTIFY PCPS AND OTHER FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY. OF AN ER VISIT- IF THERE'S AN ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL- THAT PATIENT HAS BEEN DISCHARGED THE COMMUNITY. OR TRANSFER TO ANOTHER FACILITY SO THIS IS A LOT OF HOSPITALS DO THIS TODAY- BUT THIS WILL REQUIRE OF ALL HOSPITALS IN THIS WILL BE A REQUIREMENT OF MEDICARE PARTICIPATION SO THAT ENSURES ESSENTIALLY MORE ALMOST ALL. HOSPITALS ARE PARTICIPATING THIS. SO THAT THAT COVERS THE USE CASES IN THE IN THE- REGULATION SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S BEING. TRANSFERRED BETWEEN ENTITIES AND BY THE CONSENT IS REQUIRED OR NOT. OUR NEXT FLIGHT. I JUST WANT TO COVER VERY BRIEFLY SO TO TECHNICAL COMPONENTS THAT GET THIS NOTION OF INTEROP AND W. WHERE TWO SYSTEMS CAN DO THIS VERY EASILY- ONE IS- THE CORE DATA THAT IS BEING THE MINIMUM DATA THAT IS BEING SUPPORTED IN MAKING AVAILABLE IS DATA THAT FITS INTO WHAT'S CALLED THE U. S. CPI DATA CLASSIFICATION AGAIN THAT'S U. S. COURT DATE IN A LOP ABILITY VERSION ONE. AND ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS THAT IT'S SIXTEEN DATA CLASSES IN FIFTEEN TO DATA ELEMENTS AND I KIND OF JUST LIFTED IT LISTED HERE THE VISUAL IF YOU CAN SEE IT THAT'S GOT SOME STANDARD INFORMATION LIKE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION BUT ALSO INCLUDES IMMUNIZATIONS LABS MEDICATIONS AND CLINICAL COMPONENTS SUCH AS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT VITAL SIGNS- ALLERGIES AND SO FORTH. SO THIS IS THE MINIMUM THAT WE KNOW HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS IF THEY HAVE IT IN THEIR SYSTEM IN A IN A PATIENT REQUESTED. THEY MUST MAKE OUT OF TO ANY THIRD PARTY OUT THAT THAT THE CONSUMER CHOOSES. NOW THERE'S CONSISTENCY IN A MINIMUM FLOOR THIS IS NOT ALL DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE IN CLINICAL SYSTEMS BUT THIS IS THE MINIMUM THAT EVERYONE IS BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT. I NEXT LIGHT. SO IN ADDITION TO THIS THIS FOUNDATION FOR DATA I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS JUST REALLY BRIEFLY- THREE OTHER TECHNICAL STANDARDS- THAT IT BECOMES THE BASIS THAT NOW AGAIN NOW PLANS PROVIDERS IN THESE HEALTH IT SYSTEMS WILL BE BUILDING SUPPORT FOR AND SOMETHING THAT THE STATE AS WE THINK THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THE HOW. AT TO GET PAST SOME OF THE USE CASES IS THAT A BIG PORTION OF OUR HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY NOW WILL BE SUPPORTING EMBARRASSED DATA FORMAT AND A SPECIFIC WAY TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH- TO ORGANIZATIONS NOW FOR MENISCAL FIRE A VERSION FOR- AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THIS TO FOUNDATIONS FOR EXCHANGING INFORMATION THAT PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY I AROUND CONSUMER DEDICATION AND- ACCESSING- FOR THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS. SO AS THE STATE THINKS ABOUT THEIR OWN OPTIONS THESE ARE YOU KNOW KIND OF FOUNDATION THAT MANY IN THE INDUSTRY WILL BE SUPPORTING AS WELL SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD EITHER BUILD OFF OF AND NOT EASILY REPLICATE FOR FILLING SOME GAPS AND- THAT IS STILL. OUT THERE FROM THE OF THE FEDERAL. OUR NEXT LINE. SO WHO'S IMPACTED THIS THIS NEW SORT OF DATA SHARING CONSUMER ORIENTED DATA EXCHANGE. CMS AND ONC ESSENTIALLY FOR THIS HEALTH PLAN PAYER SIDE THEY ARE MANDATING PARTICIPATION AND THAT INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE UNIQUE CMS PAYERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT REALLY WHICH ONE RELATES CALIFORNIA SO THE THREE PROGRAMS IN MEDICAID THAT INVOLVES ALL MEDICARE BUT MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES ALL ROUGHLY THIRTEEN MILLION IN CALIFORNIA- BECAUSE THE STATE STILL HAS A SMALL PORTION OF PEOPLE SERVICE THE STATE HAS DROPPED OUT DR SCOTT HAD MENTIONED. THE STATE HAS TO SUPPORT THAT CAPABILITY FOR MEDIC MEDIC CAL BENEFITS REASON PEOPLE SERVICE ALL MEDICAID MANAGED MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF MEDIKAL- BENEFICIARIES ACCESS OR A MEMBERS. HAVE SUPPORTED. AS WELL AS ENTITIES ARE DEFINED AS PREPAID INPATIENT IN PREPAID ASSEMBLY TORY HEALTH PLANS. IN CALIFORNIA WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT INCLUDES ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. ALL THE NINETEEN DRUG MEDI CAL- YES PLANTS ALSO HAVE TO AGAIN MAKE THEIR DATA AVAILABLE. CLAIMS AND ACCOUNTS CLINICAL DATA FORMALLY PROVIDER NETWORK. AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THIRD PARTY APPS IF CONSUMERS REQUESTED. SO THAT THAT THIS IS A PRETTY BIG LEFT- FOR ALL pTHIS TODAY ON THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE AND THIS IMPACTS OR IS NOW GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO- AT THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIA MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN MEDICARE. IT'S ALSO REQUIRED OF ALL- PLANS THAT PARTICIPATE MEDICAID AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE- AND THAT INCLUDES- IN CALIFORNIA THAT THE SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION PLANS WOULD DO ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE ONLY MEDICARE SO THAT'S ROUGHLY YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT SIX MILLION. CALIFORNIA SENIORS ARE ENROLLED IN A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. AND LASTLY ARE OF IT'S ALSO REQUIRED FOR HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE IN THE FEDERALLY FACILITATED EXCHANGE. IT'S AN OPTION FOR. STATE RUN EXCHANGES FOR IN CALIFORNIA IT'S COVERED CALIFORNIA. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT IF THEY INTEND TO MAKE THAT A REQUIREMENT OR NOT BUT THAT THAT STATE OPTION. AND THEN IF I CAN CONCLUDE HERE OUR NEXT SLIDE. WHEN IS THIS ALL- DO YOU WANT TO SOME OF THE DEADLINES AND YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF OTHER REQUIREMENTS IN REGULATION BUT THE ONE THAT I'M FOCUSED ON ON THESE FOR USE CASES. THE FIRST ONE WITH THIS PATIENT ACCESS AND THIRD PARTY AT. THAT IS COMING UP. IN REGIONALLY WITH JANUARY BUT GOT DELAYED BECAUSE CODED SO IT'S NOW. ONE IN A POX SEVEN. THE THAT HEALTH. NEW AND ROMAN. DATA EXCHANGE THE STILL CHEN ONE OF. TWENTY TWO AND THEN THE HOSPITAL BED NOTIFICATION THAT'S COMING ON THE SIMILAR TIME FRAME. AGAIN WITH THE ORIGINALLY WAS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. AS A RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS DELAY- AND NOW IT'S ON MAY ONE OF NEXT YEAR. THOSE ARE THE MAJOR SORT OF DEADLINES. AND I CAN CONCLUDE TO SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS THAT HOPEFULLY I ALREADY MENTIONED DURING MY PRESENTATION IT'S A PRETTY BIG LEAGUE FORD FORD- DATA AVAILABILITY DATA SHARING AND IT'S REALLY IT'S CONSUMER. ORIENTED SO HOPEFULLY THAT THAT WILL DRIVE CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT BUT WILL SUPPORT CLINICAL CARE COORDINATION. BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE JUST MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS SO THAT IT REALLY JUST SETS THE FLOOR NOT THE C. AND ACTUAL LIFE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE COMMON STANDARDS AND- YOU KNOW MORE AND WITH HEALTH PLANS HEALTH IT PROVIDERS ALL PARTICIPATING THESE REQUIREMENTS. ZACKS OPPORTUNITIES FOR A MORE COORDINATION. AND JUST A CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW IN IN THIS DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD- YOU KNOW MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THERE'S A SOLID FOUNDATION THAT'S BEEN DEALT THROUGH THE FEDERAL APPROACH AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE CAN. CAN LEVERAGE AND LEASING FORMS AND THE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY THE USE CASES. ARE MANDATING PARTICIPATION AND- SOME OF THE COMMON STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE READY SORT OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS. THAT'S ALL I HAD FOR MINE- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. WHILE THANK YOU VERY THAT'S THE AND IT'S KINDA SHEDS A WHOLE NEW LIGHT ON THE ON THE WAY THIS IS INTO TO OPERATE SO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY A QUESTIONS. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE REMOTE. NO QUESTIONS FROM REMOTE SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND SO- FIRST WHY I APPRECIATE THE REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION AND LIKE I SAID IT DOES SHED A DIFFERENT LIGHT ON THINGS- THAT I THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF SO- ARE THERE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE OR THEY'RE GONNA BE DIFFERENCES IN WHAT ARE. YOU KNOW THE ART WITH DCS AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO DO DIFFERENTLY- OF IT AND MADE OTHER SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. PROBABLY MORE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES AND GETTING INTO A LOT OF THE NEW ONES BUT- THE MAIN IS THE SIMILARITY OF- ACCESS. I JUST THIRD PARTY APPS- BASED ON CONSUMER CONSENT THAT ONE IS THE SAME- THE END. THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY INFORMATION. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ON THAT PAID A PAY DATA EXCHANGE WHERE MEMBERS INVOLVED IN A NEW PLAN THAT'S ONLY REQUIRED OF- MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IT IS NOT REQUIRED IN THE STATE. AGAIN THAT'S THE FLOOR THAT DOESN'T MEAN THROUGH STATE POLICY AND DISCUSSIONS THAT. AND NUMBER WHO MOVES FROM STATE PEOPLE SERVICE INTO A MEDIC CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN THAT THAT COULD BE. WEIGHED UP MAYBE CLOSE A LITTLE BIT OF A GAP THAT'S IN THE REQUIREMENTS- I KNOW OUR- HEALTH PLANS AND IN THE STATE YOU KNOW THAT'S OPEN FOR DISCUSSION BUT THAT'S TECHNICALLY NOT REQUIRED OF. PH CS TO SUPPORT THAT. GREAT N. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS BEING. AN ANIMATOR DIFFERENCES. OKAY OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS BEING YOU KNOW CONSUMER DIRECT GO HEAD. WITH ABSENT WITH AN APP HOW HOW DOES THIS IS HOW HOW WE HOW DO WE DRESS LIKE OLDER PATIENTS WHO MAY NOT BE TECH TECHNOLOGY SAVVY- IN IN MY DISTRICT I GET MISS AGUIAR-CURRY IS DISTRICT WE LACKED IN MANY AREAS WE LACKS CELL PHONE SERVICE WE LACK BROADBAND AND SO. HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HELPS OUR OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE HAVE THESE KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. YES TWO QUESTIONS THERE IS- SORT OF TECH SAVVY AND I THINK THAT IS ONE ISSUES THAT WITH THAT WILL COME UP OF. HOW WELL DO WE THINK THE ADOPTION WILL BE. N. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THE THIS REGULATION ABOUT ACCESS TO THIRD PARTY APPS AND CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT IT'S BUILT ACTUALLY OFF OF WHAT CMS HAS DONE FOR MANY YEARS FOR MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE AND THEY HAVE FIFTY FIVE APPS ACTUALLY IN PRODUCTION THAT ACTUALLY ARE READY SUPPORTING THIS KIND OF FUNCTIONALITY. THEY DON'T HAVE- A LOT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL AND TALKING TO SOME OF THE APPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE- HIGH USAGE I THINK SOME ADDITION FROM AWARENESS. BUT I THINK THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT PEOPLE STILL RELY ON THE PHONE AND IF IT'S NOT THEM THEMSELVES. A BIG BENEFIT OF THIS OPPORTUNITIES ACTUALLY NOT THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER BUT IN MANY CASES IS ACTUALLY THE FAMILY AND IN THE CARE GIVER WHO CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION AGAIN IF WE LOOK AT THE USE CASE BEFORE AND AFTER MANY TIMES. IT'S PAPER DRIVEN FOR ITS INCOMPLETE HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT ON THE ONE THAT THEY'RE CARING FOR AND THIS CASE- IT BE CENTRALIZED IN THE PHONE AND EVEN THE CARE GIVER. BECAUSE IT COULD BE GRANTED ACCESS. CAN HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION ON THE PHONE. SO IT'S NOT JUST IN THE CONSUMER THEY CAN GRANT ACCESS TO A PROXY- THE TO SOMEONE ELSE. THAT'S ASSUMING THEY HAVE SELF RICH. THE LACK OF CELL PHONE BROADBAND AND I THINK THAT THAT'S GONNA BE A COMMON CHALLENGE AS WELL FOR SOME CONSUMERS- BUT- AND AGAIN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN BE PLAN HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT CAN BE DONE. IN AN EXAMPLE I GIVE PEOPLE IS THERE IS AN AL ON APPLE APPLE HEALTH APP THAT ESSENTIALLY DOES IS NOW YOU CAN LOOK AT. PROVIDERS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING WITH APPLE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD YOUR HISTORY I DOWNLOAD MY SUTTER. HISTORY AND STANFORD IN A DOWNLOADING FIFTEEN SECONDS- AND I THINK THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF USING SOME OF THE MODERN TECHNOLOGIES THAT THEY'RE REQUIRING. IT'S THAT IT'S REALLY A SMALL PACKET OF DATA. AND IT'S AT THE CONSUMER LEVEL. AND THAT'S THE THEORY BEHIND IT IS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE ACCESSIBLE- IT DOESN'T TAKE. LIKE STRONG SO YOU KNOW SELL WERE BROADBAND- POWER TO. TO GET THAT INFORMATION INTO YOUR CELL PHONE. SO I MEAN THIS IS A KIND OF A NUTS AND BOLTS QUESTION SO I'M JUST TRYING TO- JUST TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND SO AS THE CONSUMER. WHO'S GOING TO ACCESS THIS APP. SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN IN THE WORLD OF DATA. THERE'S A HEALTH INFORMATION- EXCHANGE THAT RECOGNIZES THAT PATIENT AND THEN AND THEN SUPPLIES THE DATA IS THAT A FAIR ASSUMPTION. WAGEWORKS WOULD BE- THE CONSUMER DOWNLOADS THE APT THE APP THEN WOULD HAVE TO MAKE DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS TO PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS SO THEY HAVE ACCESS AND IF THE WORD E. TO REQUEST. DATA SO THAT THAT AB IS ACTUALLY TALKING DIRECTLY TO A HEALTH PLAN FOR A HEALTH CARE HEALTH PROVIDERS EHR SYSTEMS. AND THEN WHEN THEY MAKE THAT REQUEST THEY'RE SAYING HEY. I'M MAKING REQUEST ON BEHALF OF THIS PERSON. THE H. R. SYSTEMS HOW PLAN SYSTEMS OR SAY YES THAT'S A MEMBER THAT SOME WE HAVE DATA ON AND THEN THEY WOULD SEND THAT ACROSS. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTED AT EACH AYE HE'S LIKE AN H. I. LIKE ORGANIZATION IT'S REALLY DIRECTLY AT HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND AGAIN THAT'S TO. CMS AND ONC HAS AUTHORITY TO REGULATE. RIGHT WOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT ALSO THANKS FOR. MAKING THE TRIP TO OAKLAND FOR. THE TESTIMONY AND- VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER- AN XP FOR SPEAKER IS DAVID HORROCKS WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHESAPEAKE REGIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR OUR PATIENTS. AND WE'LL JUST CALL IT CHRIS- AS BASICALLY HE'S THE CEO OF THE MARYLAND H. I. E. AND HE'S GONNA BE ON THE PHONE LINE. AND SO- MISTER WORK- THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU THIRDS MAKE SURE CAN ALL HEAR. YES RIGHT YEAH SO- HAD FADED- MY NAME IS DAVID HORROCKS MY RUN- AND H. I. O. ON THE EAST COAST THANK YOU THANK YOU H. ID BUT I'LL TRY TO STICK WITH A DOCTOR THE ECONOMIC TODAY. AND MY NAME AT THIS YEAR FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE H. I. O. I'LL DESCRIBE HELP THEM SUCCESSFULLY YEARS HAVE BEEN OPENED BY ORGANIZED I'LL START WITH. CREDIT ON FLIGHT TO. CHRIS IS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COMPANY THAT WAS A COLLECTED BY MARYLAND HEALTH CARE COMMISSION IN A COMPETITIVE PRODUCT THAT BV DESIGNATED. THEY MIGHT HIV AND BEING DESIGNATED COURT DOESN'T MEAN NO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO FACILITATE EXCHANGE IN MARYLAND BUT WE ARE THE ORGANIZATION WITH WHICH THE STATE WORKS CLOSELY AS WELL DESCRIBED. I'M ALREADY TO DESIGNATE. WITH THE TABLET IN THAT THE BIT OVER A DECADE AGO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH I HAD THE PARTY TO DO GRANT TO CHRIS OUT BY OF THE SOMETIMES CUMBERSOME STATE PROBE CRIED THAT. AND THE SOURCE OF THE KERR I IN WHOLE OR IN PART FEDERAL DOLLARS. THANK YOU DOES PROVIDE BY THE EPIDEMIC SUPPORT RIGHT FUNDED. THAT NINETY TWO MATCH. ALONG WITH THAT SPECIAL STATUS THE BEST A FOR CRYPTO OBLIGATE PLACED ON IT BY THE STATE THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR BOARD COMPETITION. TO HAVE CERTAIN NINETY THREE THIRTY AUDIT POLICIES DESIGNED TO PROTECT. HM PRIVATELY. OUR DESIGNATION IS RENEWED MUST BE RENEWED EVERY THREE YEARS AND THE MARYLAND HEALTH CARE COMMISSION USE THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE STOCK OF OUR PERFORMANCE I THINK ALSO. THAT OF THE MODEL. SO WHILE WE ARE A NONPROFIT- AND WE WORK TO MAINTAIN OUR INDEPENDENCE AND GOVERNANCE YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL FROM THE DESCRIPTION. REALLY A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP OF SORTS. THAT WE PERFORM SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE STATE MIGHT OTHERWISE- NEED TO HANDLE AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO EFFICIENTLY. YOU'RE FREE FROM THE FIVE WERE ALSO A PART OF AFFILIATION AMONG FOR. STATE BY WHICH WE SHARE A SINGLE- I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE- NONPROFIT ENTITY AND- THE DISTRICT ONE B. AT WEST VIRGINIA AND- AS OF LAST MONTH CONNECTICUT. WORK WITH THE TEAM ON THE OPERATION OF THE HIV TECHNOLOGY- EVEN AT THE SEPARATE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS PRIOR. A PROJECT IN EACH STATE ENABLING LEGISLATION HELP ONCE ALL FOUR OF THOSE AFFILIATE HIV THOSE. ALL FOUR HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED. AS THEIR STATE- H. I. L. NG BUT WE DIFFERENT PROP THAT THE- I'M ALL FOR OUR STATE WIDE AND- ALL OUR PARTNERS IN SOME WAY WITH THEIR STATE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY AND WITH. AND WITH MEDICAID. SO ON FLIGHT THREE I HAVE BEEN GENERAL I'M- ABOUT. SOME H. I. EVEN AGAIN ARE GENERAL. AND NOT HARD AND FAST RULES THERE BATES ON VISIT BACK MADE TO- AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE H. I. OWES AROUND THE COUNTRY- OVER THE YEARS INCLUDING THREE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO ON THE BOARD OF THAT THE CHOIR PROJECT WHICH OPERATES TO THE NATIONAL NETWORK THE HEALTH EXCHANGE AND AIR QUALITY. ITS FIRST THREE BULLET ONE EACH IS REALLY ABOUT THE CATEGORY. OF H. I. O. AND- I GROUP A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN DOCTORS AGAIN HE- I LEFT UP A SMALL IDEA AND- THE CATEGORY AND I ADDED ANOTHER WHICH IS THAT THE FOR PROFIT VENDORS. WHICH I'LL SPEAK TO IN A MOMENT. YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE NATIONAL NETWORKS FROM MY DOCTOR'S THE CHEN YEAH MY FIRST OBSERVATION TO SHARE THAT THE FAST NETWORKS ARE. IMPORTANT FOR BASIC DATA TRANSPORT. THEY OPERATE TODAY IN CALIFORNIA AT THAT THE MAP SHOWS- THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY THE HEALTH RECORD VENDORS. AND THE TRANSACTION VOLUMES ARE GROWING EVERY YEAR. IN MY EXPERIENCE THOSE NATIONAL NETWORKS ARE TYPICALLY LEVERAGE MOST SUCCESSFULLY BY. THE FIFTY KATE AT HOSPITAL THE- HELP PLAN FUTURE MANAGER MALL PRACTICES ARE ADULTS FAR LEFT INVOLVED AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT A HARD AND FAST RULE- DEPENDING ON YOUR EHR SOME SMALL PRACTICES TO PARTICIPATE. BUT I'D SAY THAT UP ARE LEFT AND THEN LARGE TROPICAL SYSTEMS. ARE NOT ALLOWED THE PATIENT HAS BEEN ACROSS TOWN AT A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL. I NATIONAL WITH CREE. EASY FOR A NEARBY. TO OBTAIN ELECTRONIC SUMMARY OF HIS DAY. NOW THAT SUMMER WILL PROBABLY COME TO THE DOCTOR AND THE BIG LONG ELECTRONIC FILE. BUT IT FIRST VACATED HOSPITAL EMPLOYER IS HELPING- TO PARK DOWN THE MOST RELEVANT DATA. SHE'S GONNA HAVE WHAT SHE NEEDS FOR IMPROVED DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT DECISIONS. SO ON THE SECOND BULLET IMPORTANT COROLLARY AT THE TOP SURVEYS ABOUT THE NATIONAL NETWORK IF THE DATES FOR THE STRONG STATE H. I. L. ARE DOING. MUCH MORE THAN MOVING DATA. EIGHT EIGHT CHAU ARE AGGREGATING RECORDS FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES PHARMACY PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY. RECORDS ARE OFTEN PAIRED WITH CLAIMS DATA FROM COMMERCIAL PAYERS MONTHLY MEDICAID. OUR MARYLAND MEDICARE AS WELL. NOT A BIG COOK AT THE MOMENT IS TO CAPTURE MORE DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH INFORMATION- H. I. DOES NORMALIZE THEM THAT THEY DID TO MAKE IT CONSISTENT AND THEY PARKED OUT THE IMPORTANT THING. THAT EVEN A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WITHOUT SOPHISTICATED I. T. IS ABLE TO USE THAT. H. I WOULD TURN DATA INTO QUALITY MEASURES AND REPORTS WHICH THE COMMUNITY- I USE AS A BASELINE AND REPORT SHARED SAVINGS PROGRAM. AND H. I WAS TRACK PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT FACILITATE COORDINATION BETWEEN ORGANIZATION. DOCTORS DID HE MENTIONED THAT THE A WIDESPREAD SERVICE THE PUSH NOTIFICATIONS AND STATE H. I. O. I DO QUITE A BIT AT THAT MAKING SURE THAT A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER WORK YOUR MANAGER KNOWS WHEN THEIR PATIENTS SHOW UP EMERGENCY ROOM ARE MATED OR DISCHARGE FROM THE FACILITY NATIONAL NETWORKS DON'T YET PUSHED MUCH INFORMATION THEY RELY INSTEAD ON DOCTORS TO QUERY. AT THE RIGHT TIME THIS BULLET AT THE CABIN OF FOR PROFIT BENDERS. AND THAT THE BEYOND THE NATIONAL NETWORK- WHICH THAT WERE SUPPORTED BY- THE HEALTH RECORD VENDORS- AND THE NONPROFIT EIGHT EIGHT THAT WOULD I THINK THE FOR PROFIT INTER OPERABILITY VENDORS ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT MARKET PLAYER. AND SOME DO OPERATING CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANIES ARE BRINGING PRIVATE CAPITAL AND INNOVATION FOR THE INTER OPERABILITY SPACE THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND H. I. O. SUCH AS MINE TYPICALLY HAVE CUMBERSOME GOVERNANCE WHICH REQUIRES CONSENSUS AMONG PROVIDERS PAYERS AND PATIENT ADVOCATE THE INTEROPERABLE ENDERS ARE. OFTEN MOVED AND INNOVATE RAPIDLY I'D SAY THEIR BIGGEST ACCEPTED WITH QUICK NOTIFICATION THEY'RE ADDING FILTERS AND INTELLIGENT THE BRAIN- THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT THE ATTENTION OF CARE MANAGERS. AND CURRENTLY THEIR BIGGEST CONSTITUENCY- BEING TO BE HEALTH PLAN- THEY DO SOMEWHAT LAPS WITH- BASIC DATA MOVEMENT. AND GENERALLY THE FOR PROFIT INTEROPERABLE STANDARDS ARE NOT. BAD PARTNERED WITH PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IN THE WAY OF THE STATE H. I. L. BE. AFTEREFFECT OBSERVATION THE FOURTH AT IS THAT SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NOW MUCH TOP OF MIND. BUT THE THREE MARKET THE STATE H. I. O. HAVE BEEN THE MOST TIED THE PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES. I'VE BEEN A BIG FOCUS MY OWN. WHICH WE HAVE A PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT MET OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAVE THREE DOCTOR AT THE PUMP HEALTH. BUDGET TO HELP BUT BE A BETTER PARTNER- WITH THE- THREE NOW. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANS A WE WERE. I HAD NO YOU THINGS WE DONE AS FAR OF THE CODE REST. TRACKING INSEMINATING REAL TIME HOT LEVINE WORKING CALCULATING DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS INCLUDING RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA FOR INDIVIDUAL TO BEEN CATHOLIC FOR THOSE WITH POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS AND PERFECT TALIBAN WE'VE DONE THAT BY LINKING OTHER DATA THAT THE SPECIALLY CLAIM OF RANELLIDAE TECHNIQUE BY INTERMINGLED BY THE CODE. AND BY PERCENT THIS BLOCK. RELEVANT COME. THE CARE. MEDICAL AT THE MERGE TO. WE'VE BEEN HAND THAT CONTACT RATING CAPABILITIES ABOUT THE DATE INFORMATION- FROM RICK AND HEALTH CARE ENCOUNTERS PROVIDED ALSO MECHANISM FOR. CREDENTIAL CLINICIANS TO. ORDER TASK DRIVE THROUGH LOCATIONS WITH STATE OF MARYLAND- SET UP AND THAT THE ORDERING PROCESS THAT ALLOWED THEM TO AVOID LONG LINES. THOSE pOTHER H. I EAT IN THE COUNTRY ARE- ARE PERFORMING ARE NOT SIMPLE DATA EXCHANGE. ITS MARKET IS DONE BY THE PHABLET AND WEALTH FUND H. I. THAT ARE PARTNERING WITH AND REGULATED BY. THE STATE- SOME IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE TAKEN TO CALLING BUT ORGANIZATION THEIR STATE. WHAT HEALTH DATA. UTILITY ABOUT MY WORK BLYDE OF FIVE MAKES. SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE CAPITAL STATE H. EYES AGAIN YOU CAN FIND EFFECTIVE THE STATEMENT THE TAKEN A GENERALIZATION AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT THE FEW STATES THAT HE- THE ONES IN ARIZONA INDIANA NEBRASKA COLORADO MICHIGAN. DELAWARE NEW YORK RHODE ISLAND AND MAINE THEY'VE ALL BEEN OUT SOMETHING ON MY MODEL IS NOT PULLING OUT THE BULLET POINTS. THE AND THE FIRST IS THAT THEY TEND TO BE STATEWIDE. MY PARTNERS ARE PUBLICHEALTH WHEN YOU CAN ONLY COVER A PART OF THE GEOGRAPHY. DEPARTMENT ONCE FOR INSTANCE YOUR H. I. L. TO MAKE. IMMUNIZATION DATA AVAILABLE POINT OF CARE WHERE THEY WANT TO USE THE HIV CAPTURE RESULT THE- OFFICE ADMINISTERED RAPID PATH. THEY'LL WANT THE PROJECT TO COVER THE WHOLE STATE FACE LIKE MICHIGAN HAVE MIGRATED FROM REGIONAL H. I. OWES TO A ONE PROMINENT. A STATEWIDE H. I. L. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS INTO THE APPLE WITHIN A FEW MINUTES WELL. BUT I THINK IN BOTH THEIR PRIVATE NONPROFITS WITH STRONG AND DIVERSE. THEY COLDER INVOLVEMENT IN GOVERNANCE. THE H. TIME FOR OFTEN STATE I THANK BY- THE GROUP WHICH WAS MOST PROMINENT IN THEIR FOUNDING. IN MARYLAND THAT WAS HOSPITAL IN INDIANA IT WAS RESEARCHERS IN UTAH IT WAS INSURERS- BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL H. I IT WAS I BELIEVE BRING TOGETHER THE DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. AND OFF THE TOP OF PATIENT ADVOCATE THE AND H. I. O. THAT IS. TO ALIGN WITH ONE OF THOSE BURKE. AT TEN TO GET OUT OF BED AND DOESN'T DOESN'T SERVE THE OTHERS AS WELL. A IS ACCEPTABLE. H. I. O.'S ARE PARTNERED WITH PUBLIC APART THE THINK I HAVE THAT. IF PLAY I'LL TAKE YOUR H. I. O. I HI LOOK THE BACK TO COUNTRY BEEN FOR A LONG AND- THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY PARTNERED WITH THE STATE ALL THAT MUCH BUT THAT TOTALLY CHANGED THIS YEAR AND THEY ARE- WORKING WITH THE MUCH CLOSER MUCH MORE CLOSELY AT THEY RESPONDED CODED. OF COURSE TAKE I INTEND TO LEVERAGE MEDICAID FUNDING WITH GENEROUS FEDERAL MATCH. IN THE CASE OF CRAP- AND ART AND I STILL ALL. THREE OF OUR PARTNERS HERE- ALL OF OUR WHAT YOU CONSIDER CAPITAL INVESTMENT COMES FROM GRANT DOLLARS. A USER P. USER FEES PAY FOR. ONGOING OPERATION BUT EVEN THERE WERE LEVERAGING SOME MEDICAID MONEY TO OFFSET OPERATING COSTS. SHARE THE DATA I O'S AND RECEIVE SOME DATA BY MEN. RIGHT MAKES A COMPLETE ACROSS THE STATE THE HARDEST THING TO DO IS IN A TIGHT- IS TO CONVINCE EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE. THEY TAKE- TIME AND A BIG MONEY. BUT A SUBSET OF DATA IS NOW BEING COLLECTED BY MANDATE IN MANY STATES HELPING A CHILD GO FROM THE THERE TO FIX THE ISSUE WELL MUCH FASTER. BUILD LAB RESULTS HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND DISCHARGE AND- OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS ARE GAMPEL OF DATA THAT SOME STATES MANDATE GO TO THEIR DESIGNATED. H. I. L. THE BROWN. IS EXAMPLE OF DATE WHICH OFFERS DRUG RECORDS BAD UP TO THE STATE DESIGNATED H. I. L. AND THE SIX BULLET HERE ARE DEAD. AND REGULATED THAT HOW UTILITY. WHEN YOU'RE TABLET THE MANDATE IN THE PRIOR BALLOT I THINK REGULATED ABOUT THE NECESSARY AT THE AGE I WAS THE COURTS DON'T ALWAYS LIKE IT AND MY OWN BOARD I. TELL OF THE PRESERVE INDEPENDENT BUT TOPPLE REGULATION OF THE HEALTH DATA UTILITY OR H. I. O. MAKE YOUR DESIGNATED A CHILD MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T. TAKE A MONOPOLY WHICH ADDED THE FENCE THEY BEING HANDED. AND SHUT OUT THE OTHER MARKET PLAYERS. AT THE STATE OF MARYLAND FOR INSTANCE MANDATE BACK IN BUT OTHER H. I. OWES. AND THAT SERVICES AS THOSE WHICH SHARE. HM VAMPED DIRECTIVE. AB ONE MORE BULLET HERE AFTER A OF THE QUESTION THAT. WERE CRAP DAVID BECKHAM TO JAN HE AND THAT IS I WOULD MOST OF THE FIX THE H. I. AND TOWARD CENTRAL. DATA STORE ROUTE. THAN A DISTRIBUTOR THEM BOTH LIKE THEY ARE HYBRID THERE'S OF BOTH BUT A MOST CENTER. I THINK FOR THE DAY SERVICE. THAT DATA. ARE JUST EASIER TO LAW WITH CENTRAL MODEL. IF YOU JUST MOVE BASED DATA HOSPITAL THAT MORE LIKELY TO BE DONE. DECENTRALIZED. I HAD ONE LAST WHY WHICH IS THE PITFALLS I BEEN. IN OTHER STATE NINE LIKE TO CALL OUT AND SHIPS WENT MULTIPLE VICTIM BE. I'VE BEEN IN OTHER STATES WHERE THAT ARE TRYING TO BUILD- AND H. I. O. SOMEONE WILL POINT OUT NO THE DOCTOR ALREADY GET RECORDS FROM THE HOSPITAL ACROSS TOWN. AND THEY'LL BE CLEAR THAT THE WHOLE PROBLEM IT'S ALL. BUT IT REALLY IS THAT ASSEMBLY MOVING DATA- AND YOU MIGHT BE WITH THE NATIONAL NETWORK IT MAYBE A 25% POLLUTION. A SUCCESSFUL STATE H. I. L. H. I. WILL DO A MUCH MUCH MORE. THAN THAT. OKAY SECOND BULLET. IS THAT THE IN MY EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY WITH LARGER STATE. A THEY LOOK AT A BUNCH OF EXISTING H. I. OPEN TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THAT BY MAKING A NETWORK OF NETWORKS. AND THAT WITHOUT NAMING NAMES THE STATE AND GENERALLY NOT MANAGED TO TURN ON THE BAND H. I. E. CAPABILITIES. NAMIK SECTION OF NEW YORK STATE WHERE A STRONG ORDINATING ORGANIZATION. HAD MADE THEIR REGIONAL H. I. O. A FACTOR IN SERVING PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. AND I'LL CALL OUT HELD BACK IN NEW YORK CITY HE'S DONE VERY WELL THIS YEAR. I BELIEVE RESPONDING TO- THE CODED A MERCHANT ST. BUT EVEN IN NEW YORK STATE RETAIN SOME CONSOLIDATION AMONG. THE STATE'S REGIONAL- H. I. L. AND AFTER. PITFALL THAT THE BALLPARK THE RIGHT WORD FOR THE BALLOT BUT AMONG THE MOST BASIC H. I. YOU GO ABOVE SHOULD BE THE ABILITY OF A DOCTOR OR CARE MANAGER TO SUBSCRIBE. TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS EVERY TIME A PATIENT WHO BELONG TO THEM GO TO THE HOSPITAL IT DISCHARGED ITS NETWORK OR STOP WORKING EVENT LIKE- AND OVERDUE. FOR APPROVED NINETEEN FATHER THAT THAT THE DESCRIBING IS IMPORTANT AND NOT JUST RELYING ON THE PATIENT TO REMEMBER WHICH DOCTOR TO WRITE DOWN AT THE TIME OF HOSPITAL REGISTRATION. IF IN A STATE MULTIPLE AND TO THE PROVIDE THAT'S BUT THEY DO NOT IN IRAQ. DR IN CARE MANAGER ARE NOT BEING WELL SERVED AND I GUESS. WE ARE ALSO FEELING THE PATIENT. PEOPLE BENCHMARK FOR A STATE NOT THE BJP CAPABILITIES ARE ANY GOOD THE FIGURE OUT WHETHER NOTIFICATIONS ARE BEING MADE TO DOCTORS. EVERY TIME. AND I'LL CLOSE BY GIVING ONE OBSERVATION THAT PACIFIC THE CALIFORNIA- I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE CALIFORNIA- IS THAT THE GREAT EXPERTISE TO KNOW HOW. WHETHER IN- H. I. O. TOP IT'LL- WAR TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND I JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT ONCE YOU HAVE EVERYONE. ARE RUNNING THE SAME PLAY SO TO SPEAK THAT THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL- I KNOW WE CAN HAVE I THINK WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. THEN TATIAN- APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. HOW WAS MARYLAND CONVINCED- ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES LIKE THE PLANS AND INSURERS HOSPITALS DOCTORS ACCEPTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NETWORK. THE HOUSE CHRIS WOULD DRESS THE ISSUE OF EXPENSIVE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEMS FOR ALL THE PROVIDERS CONNECTING TO THE NETWORK. THANK YOU. AT GREAT QUESTIONS ON THE FIRST ONE- BUT HE DIDN'T BRING EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE. WE HAD. I THINK THE BOTH THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME AND ARCTIC FELT. REALLY HISTORY POINT WITH PROTECT THE TEN. I BELIEVE GOING BACK TEN YEARS NOW AND- THE MESSAGE BAKED THAT WAS- FOR THE BAILED. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR PARTICIPATION STRONG- PARTICIPATE IN- AS A RESULT WITH THAT- WE- ALSO- I HAVE OVER THE YEARS. INCLUDED IF YOU MANDATE AND WE GET SOME DATA THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM- FROM THE STATE HELPING THE REPORTABLE CONDITIONS UNDER LAW GO TO THE STATE AND THEY FOR WORKER COPY OVER TO- AT THE AGE THAT WE TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND WE DELIVER IT BACK TO THE POINT OF TEARS UP SOMEONE IT. BUT THEY HAD A POSITIVE VIEW GET THAT. AND IT PREGNANT THAT IS REPORTABLE. AND WE ARE FLASHING ADD UP TO A DOCTOR IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO ARRIVE. THE SECOND PART WHETHER WE HOW WE DEALT WITH THE- EHRS. AND I BELIEVE YOU MEANT IN THE AMBULATORY SPACE WE HAVEN'T ENTIRELY ACCEPTABLE. ALL OF OUR LARGER PRACTICES CERTAINLY ALL OF OUR HOSPITAL PRACTICES- PARTICIPATE. AND A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PRACTICES WITH THE INFORMATION FROM US ESPECIALLY THOSE BEEN COUNTER NOTIFICATION- BUT- A DISAPPOINTINGLY LARGE NUMBERS BILL. DO NOT STAND UP CLINICAL INFORMATION THEY'LL SEND US A ROSTER OF. AFTER WE KNOW WHAT INFORMATION BENEFIT THEM- BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING EVERYTHING. WE NEED YET PROBLEM NOT FROM SMALL PRESS. GREAT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR REMOTE. NOTE OF CITY OKAY I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- AND YOU ANSWERED I HAD DIED SEVERAL BUT YOUR HANDS ARE A COUPLE OF THEM SO IT'S SO ENCOURAGING TO SEE THAT THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES PROVIDED DURING THE PANDEMIC BYE BYE CHRIS- I'M I'M CURIOUS IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH CHRIS THAN. VERSUS WHAT WE SEE INTERNATIONAL EHRS AND OR THROUGH ANY HEALTH EXCHANGE. MORE DETAILS ABOUT THEIR YES THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES- THE COR DOCUMENT IF YOU WILL THEY GET MOVED BY THE NATIONAL NETWORK IS A- A STANDARD DOCUMENT CALLED- A DVD OR SOMETIMES THE TVA. AND IF THAT IT'S A STRUCTURED ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS THAT ALLOW THE H. R. ON THE FAR SIDE TO. INJECTED AND MAKE IT PART OF THE WITH THE MESSAGE IF SO CHOSEN ON THE FAR END. AND THERE'S A CERTAIN SOPHISTICATION OF THAT. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. WHAT CLINICIANS USE FROM CRAP THE MOLD. AND COULD BE SIMPLER INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. A PART OUT OF THOSE WERE WHICH WE'VE REPEATED SOME OTHER WAY. SO WE MIGHT DELIVER JOHN. THE LIST OF KNOWN DIAGNOSES ENTER OF THE FULL DOCUMENT FOR. PROBABLY OUR MOST- WORKFLOW FRIENDLY HING THAT WE DO IS. IN CERTAIN HOSPITALS THAT THE POSITION IS BORDERING PRESCRIBING AN OPIOID WE POP UP IMMEDIATELY PRIOR OPIOID THAT HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED OR AN OVERDOSE THAT THAT THAT A PATIENT MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCE. SO THE WORD DEFENDING BETTER THAN FORMATION BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT IN A MORE WORK FLOW FRIENDLY WAY. AND THEN I'D CALL THAT A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- THE NATIONAL NETWORKS AND OURSELVES. FREE THANK YOU. WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE DATA IN CRISP IS IT HEALTH PLANS INSURERS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- IS IT A SUBSCRIPTION HOW TO HELP PEOPLE GET HAD PEOPLE GET TO THE INFORMATION. WHO AND WHO GETS TO THE INFORMATION ABOUT. YES HELLO WE REALLY BEGAN WITH- WITH THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OPPOSITION TO NURSES. AND OUR PURSUIT CASE THEY ARE CREDENTIALED THROUGH THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION THE PRICKLY. OUT WORK THERE A SMALL PRACTICE WITH THEIR CREDENTIALED- DIRECTLY WITH- WITH B. H. I. L. AND- THE LAW PRACTICE WOULD LOG INTO THE PORTAL TO ACCESS INFORMATION A- A HOSPITAL OR LARGER PRACTICE MIGHT ACT THAT THE INFORMATION RIGHT WITHIN THEIR OWN. HR HEALTH PLANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA BUT IT IS FAR MORE LIMITED PURPOSES AT THE FIND IN IN OUR PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT. AND PUBLIC HEALTH HAS ACCESS TO THE DATA AGAIN FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES ALLOWED BY LAW I BELIEVE INVESTIGATION PRINT THAN. AND THEN WE DO A LOT THAT IS TAKING DATA THAT COMES TO A IDENTIFIED. ABROGATING IT AND THEN DISTRIBUTING IT BACK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY HE IDENTIFIED AND- THAT MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE VERY BROADLY. RIGHT SO AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION IS A LITTLE BIT- WAS ACTUALLY COUPLE COUPLE QUESTIONS EMBEDDED HERE BUT IT'S AROUND THE SAME SUBJECT. SO IS THERE EVER BEEN ANY CALCULATION ON THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF HAVING AN EXCHANGE. BECAUSE WHAT AND THE REASON I ASK THIS IS ONE OF THE USE CASES AS- A REPUBLICAN A REDUCTION IN YOU KNOW DUPLICATIVE LAB WORK OR IMAGING OR READMISSION. COSTS OR YOU KNOW AN EASY VISITS SO WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS ANYONE QUANTIFIED WHAT IT COSTS TO ESTABLISH THE EXCHANGES. VERSUS A SAVINGS THAT WOULD HAVE THAT THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS HEALTHCARE SAVINGS COSTS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM. FROM THEM. RIGHT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ACADEMIC STUDY THAT LOOK AT THE I. WOOD CHARACTERIZED ALL OF THEM AS MEASURING- VOEPEL. AS LOOKING AT PRODUCTS MEASURES AND NOT HEALTH OUTCOMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GO ALL THE WAY TO- THE IMPACT YOU'RE HAVING ON HEALTH THROUGH THESE TOOLS THE TOOLS ARE ALWAYS JUST- SUPPORT THE OTHER CLINICAL INITIATIVES OR THINK THAT DOCTORS ARE DOING. SO I HATE TO SAY THAT THE BODIES MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY SATISFYING AND HOW WELL THEY ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING- BUT THEY HAVE BEEN TEMPTED. I GUESS AND THE REASON I ASK IS THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIG- CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE IS THE GROWING COST OF HEALTHCARE. AND ELIMINATING SOME OF THE DUPLICATE DUPLICATION AND HEALTHCARE- IS ONE OF THE STATED GOALS OF THIS BUT I YOU KNOW I THINK WEEK WE KIND OF AT SOME POINT REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND ARE WE ARE WE ARE WE ADDING THE LATE ADDING SOMETHING TO THE SYSTEM. AND GETTING OUT WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING TO GET OUT AND IF WE ARE AT WHAT LEVEL THAT'S HAPPENING SO- THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE- YOU KNOW AS STEWARDS OF PUBLIC RESOURCES HERE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND SO. MAY NOT BE THE QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER BUT BUT TRUST ME AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW A THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WILL NEED ANSWERS AROUND THAT- THERE IS NO DOUBT THE INFORMATION IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE- BUT I'M LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF. OF HOW WE- HOW WE USE THIS IN A WAY TO HELP MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE SO ANYWAY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THAT THAT'S THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT I KNOW I. AND I KNOW IT IT ACTUALLY MAY BE PREMATURE QUITE FRANKLY- YOU KNOW BASED ON ON WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS. I CAN TELL AT THAT THOUGHT RATHER THAN FOCUSING. PRIMARILY ARE ONLY ON- BENEFITS WITH THEM AT THE POINT OF CARE. YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT THE BENEFITS THE YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH AFTER. AND AS I MENTIONED- YOUR IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC. THAT THE H. I. OWES WHICH HAVE WHICH WERE ALREADY IN THE BORDER AND WHICH ALREADY HAD A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DATA ARE PROVING A REALLY VALUABLE TO THOSE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. I WOULD LOOK AT THAT AS WELL AS YOU CONSIDER. THE BEST ORDERS OR OUT TO CALIFORNIA GREAT GREAT. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ASSUME IT'S- DINNERTIME OUT THERE HER PAST DINNER TIME SO- APPRECIATE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FIRST PARTICIPATION AND VERY VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HORROCKS. AND WITH THAT WE WILL GO AND MOVE ON TO OUR TO OUR LAST SPEAKER- OUR LAST SPEAKER. IS JONAH FROHLICH. THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR MANAGEMENT AT HEALTH STRATEGIES- AND THE AUTHOR OF EXPANDING PAYER AND PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AND DATA EXCHANGE OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA SO- AS THE LAW OBVIOUSLY A LONG HISTORY IN THIS AND IS ACTUALLY IN OUR WITNESS VIDEO ROOM IN THE STATE CAPITAL SO. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. RIGHT THANK YOU AFTERNOON THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND AGUIAR-CURRY FOR THE- OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY- ABOUT. THE TOPIC. ONE OF MY MENTORS DR MARK SMITH A FORMER CEO OF THE COMPANY HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION- HE WAS IMPRESSED UPON ME THE NEED YOU'RE CONVEYING IMPORTANT MESSAGES FORUMS LIKE THESE THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT AT FIRST YOU TELL THE AUDIENCE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TELL THEM. CAN YOU TELL THEM. ANY TELEMARKETER. SO THIS IS A PART IN IT TELL YOU WHAT TO TELL YOU. THREE THREE ABOUT THREE THINGS THAT REALLY BASED ON WHAT'S IN THE REPORT THAT YOU. JUST REFERENCE THE MEMBER WOULD. FIRST NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE LEVERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. MEMBERS ARE AVAILABLE TO- POLICYMAKERS AGENCY LEADS- NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. HEALTH PLANS OTHERS TO ENCOURAGE ADOPTION AND USE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THE COMMISSION EXCHANGE. THEN I'M GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES OF CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES AND HOW THEY USED SOME. OF THE FIRST TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND THEN. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD THE NORTH. EXCHANGE TOPIC THAT. VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AND MANY OF THOSE WHO PRESENTED TODAY AND HAVE A VERY. THERE'S A SLIDE DECK THANK YOU CAN'T JUST TURN TO THE FOR PAGE. ITS TITLE BACK AFTER TEAM POLICY CONTRACTING AND FINANCE LOVERS. AND HERE- ONE OF PRESS UPON YOU THAT VARIETY OF THESE ARE LOOKING ON EACH EXCLUSIVE LEVERS THAT CAN BE USED TO ADVANCE A CHILD EITHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TOGETHER- IN ORDER TO ADVANCE INFORMATION EXCHANGE- AND THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTENSITY I MEANING pSOME OF THEM ARE. MUCH MORE RIGOROUS AND INTENSE AND OTHERS ARE SOFTER TOUCH SO STARTING ON THE LEFT THERE SOME LEVERS THAT ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE. COLLABORATIVE ADVISORY BODIES AND FINANCING IN SUPPORT OF INCENTIVE STRUCTURES. THAT CAN HELP CREATE AND SUPPORT INFORMATION EXCHANGE. THEY'RE CONTRACTING AND- REGULATORY LEVERS THAT ARE MORE DIRECTIVE ESSENTIALLY TELLER DIRECT STAKEHOLDERS. WERE IMPLICATED BY OTHER REGULATION OR CONTRACT BUT THEY SHOULD DO. AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE ARE MORE EXECUTIVE OR LEGISLATIVE THERE ARE YOU HEARD. THERE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE MANDATE EXAMPLE VARIOUS STATES- AND THAT'S THROUGH LEGISLATION. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THIS THAT BEFORE CONSIDERING WHICH LEVERS TO DEPRESS OR TO USE THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT- TICKET LATER VISION AND THE PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED. BEFORE APPLYING THESE LEVERS OTHERWISE YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY. YOUR HAMMER CHOOSE ANY ONE OF THESE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND THEY'LL IT. SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS REALLY WHAT IS IT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S THE VISION OR THE PROBLEMS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. THE NEXT FIVE DAYS. SO IF WE START THE FAR LEFT SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM HERE. WE START WITH THE MORE SUPPORTIVE LETTERS. AND THESE ARE AROUND COLLABORATIVE'S ADVISORY COUNCILS AND FUN AND FINANCING WEAVERS. NOW THESE LEVERS- ARE CAN BE EFFECTIVE. IN SUPPORTING A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT BROUGHT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT- AND THEY HELP CREATE THINGS LIKE POLICIES STANDARDS- PROGRAMS AND OTHER. INITIATIVES INCLUDING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE DONE TOGETHER. AND ENACTED TOGETHER AND SUPPORTED. AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THOSE THAT EXIST ALL OVER THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA HAS A K. HIGH AND DOCTOR STOPPAGE OF THIS EARLIER. WHICH IS A GROUP OF ORGANIZATIONS HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS POLICYMAKERS AND OTHERS WHICH HELPED CREATE. POLICY DOCUMENTS- COUNTERSIGNED SUPPORT THINGS LIKE THE DEVELOPMENT OF C. TEN. AND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE IN MICHIGAN THAT HAS- A QUALITY COLLABORATIVE THAT'S- MANY YEARS OLD VERY EFFECTIVE- THAT SUPPORTS A SERIES OF QUALITY MEASURES DIRECTED BY A LARGE PART THAT THE PRIVATE CARE TO CROSS THEIR AND INCLUDES COLECTING QUALITY MEASURES AND DATA. THEN OUR FINANCING PROGRAMS UNDER FINANCING PROGRAMS AND DR SCOTT MENTIONED SOMEBODY'S ALREADY THAT HIGH TECH IN THE USUAL GRAHAM WHICH- PROVIDE. SOME FUNDING FOR- SUPPORTING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE- AND THERE ARE OTHERS INCLUDING FIVE MEDICAID WAIVERS AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY AND PURCHASING INCENTIVES FOR- THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS THAT CAN. I SUPPORT INFORMATION EXCHANGE EXAMPLES AGAIN THE DOCTOR SCOTT REFERENCED WAS CAL HOT WHICH IS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM TO SUPPORT ON BOARDING UP MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO INFORMATION EXCHANGES OR OTHER INFORMATION EXCHANGE ORGANIZATIONS. NOT THE CONSERVE SOME OF THESE ARE OR IS THAT ONE IS WITHOUT. POWER ENFORCEMENT A FORTY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A RULE OF LAW THIS IS NOT A REGULATION IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT I TO COMPEL PARTICIPATION OR TO ACT ON AND SOMETHING LIKE AN ADVISORY COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS. A SECOND ISSUE IS THAT FUNDING FOR SOME OF THESE INITIAL ONBOARDING COSTS ON ARTS US THE STATE SO THEY MAKE FUNDING FOR ONBOARDING. BUT FOR ONGOING COSTS OF WHICH CAN BE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL- OFTEN MANY OF THESE FUNDING SOURCES DON'T SUPPORT THOSE ONGOING COSTS IN THE LAWSUIT JUST THE USE OF THE HIGH TECH ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING TO SUPPORT- HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THAT'S GOING TO EXPIRE. THIS WAS LAW-THAT WAS PASSED OVER A DECADE AGO THE CREATED THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM INCLUDING A 90% FEDERAL MATCH AND THAT'S GOING TO EXPIRE NEXT YEAR. SO THAT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY WILL LIKELY BE SOMEWHAT CLOSED. SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE WE'RE ON SLIDE. A THREE DIRECTED LEPERS SO THIS IS SORT OF THE LEVERS THAT DESPITE CONTRACTING RULE MAKING. I TOOK PART IN OPERABILITY. I TOOK PART MISSION EXCHANGE MARKS NETWORK PARTICIPANTS STATE PURCHASERS REGULATORS AND OTHERS THE PROMULGATED EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS AND RULES. SO A CONTRACTING AUTHORITY IS JUST AS IT SAYS IT'S THE FORTY THAT'S AT ISSUE THROUGH THE CONTRACT THE PROCUREMENT OF A MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BY A PURCHASER CAN INCLUDE INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS. A COVER CALIFORNIA WHICH YOU HAVE A VERY NICE PASSED BY THE WAY. SOME OF THESE REQUIRED IN THE TOP SEVEN HAS HAD IN THE PAST THAT TRIED TO INCENTIVIZE CREATE THE RIGHT SORT OF. ALIGNMENT TO ENCOURAGE HEALTH PLANS TO USE. NETWORKS THAT HAVE INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF THEM STATE AGENCIES CAN ALSO USE REGULATORY RULEMAKING- TO ADVANCE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AND THESE CAN ARE REALLY ALIGNED WITH- AGENCY GOALS- IN ORDER TO CREATE INCENTIVES OR THERE CAN BE LICENSING RULES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED AROUND HOW CERTAIN TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER HOSPITALS NURSING HOMES OR OTHERS. MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE INFORMATION EXCHANGE OR EXCHANGE INFORMATION AS PART OF A LICENSING PROCESS SO THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES AS WELL- OF HOW THESE TYPES OF RULES THESE TYPES OF LETTERS HAVE BEEN USING MICHIGAN'S ANOTHER ONE WHERE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. ARE ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. CONNECTIVITY THROUGH THEIR THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS. NOW SOME SOME OF THE CONS OF THESE OF PARTICULAR CONTRACTING SITE IS THAT THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE A CONTRACT AND HAVE. ALL SORTS OF CLAUSES IN IT. BUT THERE ARE SOME CASES- SOME RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENFORCING THOSE RULES ESPECIALLY IF YOU AVE A FRAGILE NETWORK- YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEY. YES THEY ARE WEALTHY PAYER. AND SO IF YOU HAD A SET OF REQUIREMENTS AND PENALTIES THAN. THOSE WHO ARE BEHOLDEN TO THE CONTRACT HELPED BY THE PROVIDER NETWORKS MAY SAY THE COST IS TOO MUCH. AND THEY WALK AWAY FROM IT AND SO IT MAKES THOSE NETWORKS MORE FRAGILE AND UNSTABLE THE OTHER IS THAT. IN THIS IS A PARTICULAR AROUND RULEMAKING- GUIDANCE THAT WITHOUT CLEAR DIRECTION FROM STATE LEADERSHIP SOME AGENCIES MAY PRIORITIZE OTHER THINGS OTHER OTHER PRIORITIES AND DIFFERENT AGENCIES MAY PURSUE DIFFERENT PATHS WHICH CAN RESULT IN DOWNSTREAM I STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE IMPACTED OR AFFECTED BY RULES MAY BE AFFECTED BY. RULES THAT ARE CONSISTENT OR ONLINE. I'M AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS- THAT OR OR SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THIS CONTRACT OF THESE CONTRACTS FOR RULEMAKING OF APRS WE HAVE SEEN AGAIN SOME OTHER STATES THAT HAVE USED EFFECTIVELY SOME OF THESE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS NORTH CAROLINA IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. WHERE THEY HAVE BOTH BLUE CROSS. WILL BLUE CROSS- IS A LARGE PAIR THERE AT THE S. OR THE BIGGEST PRIVATE PAY ARE. ALSO INVOLVED OR WILL BE LIKELY MEDICAID WHEN THEY GO THROUGH MANAGED CARE. AND THEY HAVE CONTRACTED REQUIREMENTS AND THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE- CONNECTIVITY TO A STATE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE HEALTH CONNECTS. I'M AS PART OF THEIR- THE CONTRACTS THEY HAVE WITH THEIR PLAN WITH THEIR PROVIDER NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FINALLY ARE ON THE FAR EXTREME IS EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND LEGISLATIVE LEVERS AND SO GOVERNOR'S AN EXECUTIVE ORDER- AS YOU KNOW HOW TO FORTY TO DIRECT STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES TO AND- AND PURCHASES ARE THE PURVIEW TWO TO- ENCOURAGE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE- THROUGH A CERTAIN RULE MAKING THAT EXIST WITHIN EXISTING THAT THAT THEY HAVE WITHIN THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITIES- LAW OF COURSE CAN ANYTHING HENCE. THE AUTHORITY OF VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES AND CREATE NEW RULES OR REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE WHO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM OR FOR OTHER ACTORS IN THE STATE LIKE PLANTS AND PROVIDERS. REQUIRE THEM TO DO THINGS SURE AT THE PROS AND CONS ARE AS FOLLOWS ON FOR AN EXECUTIVE ORDER- THEY CAN BE ACTED VERY QUICKLY- SO THEY CAN BE DONE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- AND THEY CAN DIRECT STATE AGENCIES TO COORDINATE THEIR ACTIONS. IN CERTAIN WAYS AS LONG AS THOSE AGENCIES ACTUALLY HAVE NINE FORTY TWO ACTON IN WAYS THAT THEY'RE DIRECTED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN LEGISLATIVE- IS A LONGER TIME FRAME TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OBVIOUSLY IF OF- OF HEARINGS ETCETERA- BUT IT CAN IT CAN ENACT NEW AUTHORITIES ARE YOU CAN CREATE NEW LAW. MANDATES AS YOU'D HEARD- PREVIOUSLY THAT WILL REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE- THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AMONG STEP IN FRONT SPECIFIED PARTICIPANTS. SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THE CONS OF THE TWELFTH FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER. YOU CAN ORDER STEP WE DON'T GO THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEARINGS TYPICALLY- THEY DON'T GO THROUGH THAT SORT OF STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND SO THEY'RE OFTEN THEY CAN CREATE OR BREED MISTRUST OR- OR ANGST OR OR OR WORSE- ABOUT THE NEW RULES AND- NEW REQUIREMENTS THERE PUT. PLACE I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE. IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATION. ONE OF THE SHORTCOMINGS IN SOME CASES MAYBE THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LAW AND THERE'S ONE EXAMPLE IN MINNESOTA WHERE THERE IS A STATEWIDE MANDATE FOR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD USE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN WHILE MINNESOTA THE- THE MANDATE FOR EHRS RELIEF- HAD WENT INTO EFFECT AND WHAT WAS ALIGNED WITH HIGH TECH THERE IS REALLY VERY. MINIMAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS FOR THAT THE INFORMATION EXCHANGE MANDATE AS A RESULT- THAT REALLY HASN'T COME TO PASS THERE HASN'T BEEN THE SAME SORT OF THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE. THAT YOU SEE IN PLACES LIKE MARYLAND OR MICHIGAN OR NORTH CAROLINA WHERE. LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTIVES AND MANDATES- HAVE EXISTED AND HAVE HELP TO PUSH FORWARD INFORMATION EXCHANGE. SO THAT'S SORT OF WHERE THE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LEVERS EXISTS NOW WHAT DID WE LEARN AND WHICH DESCRIBE IN THE PAPER ABOUT HOW THESE ARE USED TOGETHER- FIRST OF ALL- I THINK ONE IS THAT WE FIND THAT. A MAJOR BARRIER IN AND STATES THAT CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH INFORMATION EXCHANGE IS THAT THERE'S A LACK OF SUPPORT OF STATE POLICIES AND LEADERSHIP YOU HEARD FROM AGAIN FROM THEIR HEART THAT. IN MARYLAND WHAT REALLY GOT. THE STATE MOVING WAS A GOVERNOR AND THE SECRETARY WHO WAS BEING- WHO TOOK THIS ON AS A MAJOR INITIATIVE FOR THE FOR THE STATE. AND FOLLOWED UP WITH LEGISLATION THAT ESSENTIALLY REQUIRED PARTICIPATION HIV OR H. I. O. SO WE FIND THAT NGUYEN IN STATES WHERE YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF STRONG LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT OF POLICIES THAT ARE DIRECTED INCLUDING MANDATES. YOU TEND TO GET STATES THAT ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL. THE SECOND IS THAT THERE'S THIS IN MANY STATES THAT HAVEN'T REALLY ADVANCED THE BALL AS MUCH- THERE CAN BE A LACK OF A COMPELLING BUSINESS CASE AND A LACK OF INCENTIVES OR FINANCING. MARYLAND TOOK CARE OF THAT BY HAVING THIS GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM WHICH REALLY ALIGNS WELL WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO EXCHANGE DATA. MICHIGAN SIMILAR REYES HAD A PAIR OF I'VE MENTIONED. THAT OUTLINED INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS AND MANAGED CARE IN MEDICAID ALSO HAS REQUIREMENTS AROUND INFORMATION EXCHANGE. SO YOU YOU HAVE WERE STRONG REQUIREMENTS OF STRONG PAYER ALIGNMENT INCLUDING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND THE SAME THING WITH NORTH CAROLINA- YOU HAVE A MANDATE IN THE STATE. YOU HAVE A CARE IN BLUE CROSS THAT IS INCENTIVIZING AND REQUIRING INFORMATION EXCHANGE. YOU HAVE STATE FUNDING FOR THE INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND YOU HAVE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND- FOR THE PAYMENTS TO SUPPORT ONBOARDING FOR NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS. YOU KNOW THE LACK IS AROUND PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR SOME TYPES OF DATA THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MEDIATED BY HIPAA AND- OTHER ACTS. BUT THERE STILL REMAINS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AROUND- EXCHANGING INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE WITH WITH WITH. THERE IS A PROCESS MONITOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND HIV- AND THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA. SO MOST OF WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT MOST STATES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL HAVE REALLY CREATED A SERIES OF LEVERS ARE DEPRESSED MULTIPLE LEVERS OF WANTS TO BOTH. CREATE MANDATE HAVE A SUPPORT STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES INCENTIVES AND PAYMENTS. AT THAT HAS- A WINE CONTRACTING BOTH IN MEDICAID AND ALSO IN THE PRIVATE CONTEXT AND THEY ALSO USED A SERIES OF THESE SORT OF SUPPORTIVE STRUCTURES LIKE INCENTIVES. AND THE SUPERVISORY GROUPS THAT HELP DEFINE AND SUPPORT POLICY DEVELOPMENT. SO WHEN I TELL YOU I TOLD YOU- WHAT KIND OF LEVERAGE WERE AVAILABLE. I'M WHAT WE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE STATES THAT HAVE USED A VERY SLIPPERS AND- HOW THOSE LEVERS CAN BE USED IN COMBINATION AND HAVE BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN USED TOGETHER. IN A FRIDAY STATES TO ADVANCE INFORMATION EXCHANGE- AND WITH THAT I THINK THAT- HELLO WE'VE OPENS YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. ANYONE OTHER THAN ME. MR BONTA. BUT YOU NEED A NEED THERE THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES I THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR MISTER- FOLLOW FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AT X. ONE THINK ARE OUR OUR CHAIR FOR- UPLIFTING THIS IDEA PROVIDING THE ROBUST AND THOROUGH DISCUSSION TODAY FROM MANY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES I DEFINITELY THINK THAT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES ARE- WORTHY OF OUR VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION I THINK WE SHOULD CHAMPION AT THIS YEAR AND- IT REALLY BE A SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES WELCOME IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS WE TRY TO PROVIDE. A TO ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE TO EVERY SINGLE DAY CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S SOMETHING IS MISSING RIGHT NOW SO I'M I'M I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER- AND IF THERE'S A COALITION BUILDING TO WORK ON THIS I'M I I'M HAPPY TECH TO WORK WITH THE COALITION- SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN OUR COLLEGE PARTICIPATED TODAY I THINK YOU CAN REALLY REMOVE- SOME INEFFICIENCIES REMOVE IT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE WHAT I CALL FRICTION IN THE SYSTEM THAT THAT NEED TO BE THERE THAT LEADS TO WORSE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND WORST PATIENT CARE YOU CAN INCREASE AFFORDABILITY. ABSOLUTE OF GOOD BENEFITS TO IT AND I APPRECIATE THE MENU OF OPTIONS I JUST PRESENTED- SHOULD TO THE LEGISLATURE WANNA- OR SORRY SHOULD CALIFORNIA WANT TO AS AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE GIVEN ARE PROJECTED FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT I WANT TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION OUT WITH AS MUCH CLARITY AS POSSIBLE TO GET A HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE UP AND RUNNING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHICH OF THE MENU. WHICH OF THE OPTIONS IN THE MENU. WE YOU RECOMMEND. I YOU SWIMMING ABOUT THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- BUT I THINK FIRST OF ALL. ARTICULATING A VISION FOR WHAT THE STATE REALLY WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH IN ITS PRIORITIES IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FIRST AND IF THE STATE CAN DO THAT WITH THIS LEADERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND DEFINE WHAT THOSE PRIORITIES ARE THE BEST PRIORITIES COULD BE ANYTHING FROM CAROLINE AND ADVANCING PUBLIC OPTING OF THE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT CALTRAIN IS INTENDED TO- IMPROVE AROUND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- OR FITS AROUND PANDEMIC RESPONSE FOR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION. FIRST DEFINING WHAT THOSE THOSE USE CASES AND THOSE ISSUES ARE. THAT'S THE THAT HAS TO BE A PRICE. FOLLOWING THAT. IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE CALIFORNIA ADVANCING FURTHER WITHOUT HAVING SOME SORT OF DIRECTIVE FROM THE STATE AND THE FORM OF A MANDATE OF SOME KIND THAT SUPPORTS THAT VISION. OUT WE'VE TRIED FOR DECADES- AND I'VE BEEN AT THE STATE WHEN WE TRIED AND DID NOT SUCCEED IN ADVANCING INFORMATION EXCHANGE AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD WE DID IT WITHOUT A MANDATE- AND- QUITE FRANKLY WITHOUT HAVING SOME MORE DIRECTIVES BUT ALSO SUPPORTIVE POLICIES- BECAUSE UNFUNDED MANDATE AND AS YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE A DEFICIT- DOES NOT CREATE THE KIND OF TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS IN PARTICULAR THOSE IN THE SAFETY NET. WE'RE GONNA BE IMPACTED BY. SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU CONSIDER THE VISION GOALS. CREATE A LEGISLATIVE. PROCESS TO BE DIRECTIVE BUT ALSO TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BEAR A GREAT DEAL ACOSTA AND FINDING THOSE FUNDING SOURCES WHETHER IT'S LEVERAGING. FEDERAL MONIES ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE A PRIORITY IN PROCEEDING. THINK OF IT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN ACT OR OF COURSE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WELL I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS I DEFINITELY AND AM INTERESTED IN ANY FEDERAL MATCHES 90% IS- HIGHLY WELCOME ENCOURAGED IF IT'S IF IT'S POSSIBLE- AND- AB-IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW CLARITY IT IN MAYBE IN THE FORM OF A MANDATE- YOU KNOW I'M A LEGISLATOR AND AT AND WE CAN. AND THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE BODY SO WE SEE A LOT OF THINGS TO THE LEFT OF LEGISLATION I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE ONLY. WAY TO MOVE- IMPORTANT POLICIES FORWARD BUT- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE SAYING LEGISLATION IT COULD COULD BE A AN IMPORTANT WAY TO PROVIDE THE CLARITY DEPRIVE THE MANDATE- AND YOU HAVE A- COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE- MEANING YOU YOU SEE WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND DONE WELL. YOU MENTION YOUR TESTIMONY MARYLAND NORTH CAROLINA YOU THINK THAT NORTH CAROLINA STATUTE OR SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT CLOSELY I. I THINK IT IS I THINK ONCE ONCE THERE'S A CLARITY OF THE VISION AND THE PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THE PRIORITIES. LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS MODELS OF STATES HAVE TAKEN- MARYLAND'S NORTH CAROLINA- HARD PART TWO. GOOD EXAMPLES BUT THERE ARE OTHERS- WOULD BE. A VERY WORTHWHILE ENDEAVOR JUST TO ENSURE THAT WHAT. WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE MAKE IT CHEAPER BOND HAS AND WHAT RESULTS. HAVE BEEN. APPROVED NOT ANOTHER STATE SO I WOULD. CERTAINLY LOOK AT THEM AS- ESPECIALLY IF IT ALIGNS WITH SORT OF THE VISION OF THE PRIORITIES THAT. WE NEED TO SET UP. THANK YOU MISTER PHILIP YOUR TESTIMONY WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEVADA THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MR BONTA APPRECIATED GOOD TO SEE YOU- A COUPLE QUESTIONS- MISTER PRODUCT AND- THE FIRST OF ALL WHAT DO YOU SEE AS SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. GAPS IN HEALTH INFORMATION DATA EXCHANGE RIGHT NOW. WELL ONE INPUT- OTHER THAN FOR THE LEVERS YOU MENTIONED AROUND IRAQ. HELLINGER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ONE IS JUST AROUND FUNDING- THERE ARE. HUNDREDS OF HOSPITALS FOR HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MANY WHICH ARE SAFETY NET HOSPITALS ARE CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS THAT DO NOT HAVE EXTENSIVE- AND BACK SENSE OF RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING. TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO AN INFORMATION EXCHANGE TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT CONNECTION THERE COMMUNITY CLINICS EIGHT HUNDRED CORPORATIONS ORGANIZATIONS- OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY CORPORATIONS AND A NUMBER OF SMALL PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO CONNECT AND SUSTAIN A CONNECTION BASED ON THE CURRENT REVENUES PARTICULAR MANY THE MARKET VERY HARD. I COVERED. SO THAT'S A SHIFT THAT'S IT INSTEAD MORE. CONCERN OR ISSUE BUT IT LONGER TERM YOU STILL HAVE SMALL PRACTICES THAT JUST COULD NOT BEAR THE BURDEN OF CONNECTING TO AN INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AND SUSTAINING THAT COST THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME WAY TO SUPPORT THAT- MANY OF THOSE CONSTITUENCIES. THAT'S ONE I THINK THE SECOND IS THERE'S A LACK OF THE KIND OF A REALLY COMPELLING BUSINESS CASE. WHEN HEALTH CARE IS STILL. LIKE IT OR NOT IT'S STILL A BUSINESS FOR THE MOST PART IT MAY BE PRINT NOW PREDOMINATED BY A NUMBER OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS BUT- IT IS A MARKET DRIVEN. ECONOMY AND UNLESS THERE IS A VERY CLEAR BUSINESS RATIONALE. AGAIN IT CAN BE SUPPORTED BY ENABLING LEGISLATION OR OTHER POLICIES BUT UNLESS THERE'S A CLEAR RATIONALE ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO CHOOSE. WHAT TO INVEST IN BASED ON MANY THANKS THEIR MISSIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE KNOWN IF THERE'S NO MARGIN IS NO MISCHIEF THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST- AND SO THEY HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS BASED ON- THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS. AND THERE IS NOT REALLY YET COMPELLING BUSINESS CASE IN CALIFORNIA- UNLIKE IN MARYLAND WHERE THERE'S ESSENTIALLY A REQUIREMENT BASED BECAUSE THEY PRODUCT LOCAL. THE PRODUCT GLOBAL BUDGET PROCESS AND THEY GET DATA FROM THE HOSPITAL THREE THIRTY JACQUI TO ENABLE AND SUPPORT THAT- SO WITHOUT A COMPELLING BUSINESS CASES WITHOUT FINANCING THOSE ARE TWO OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS I THINK THAT WE FACE. TODAY SO- FROM. NOW MAY I MISS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED SUBJECT OBVIOUSLY I MAY HAVE MISSED. MAY MISUNDERSTOOD THIS BUT- IS THE FUNDING FOR SOME OF THIS RUNNING OUT IN SEPTEMBER. FOR IS THAT WE HEARD FROM MARK FROM DH CS THAT- THAT THERE WAS THERE'S SOME FUNNY RUNNING OUT IN SEPTEMBER. IS THAT. IS THIS TIED TO THE 90% FEDERAL MATCH IS THAT GOING TO BE AN ONGOING- MATCH THAT'S OUT THERE IN PERPETUITY OR OR OR NOT MORE WE CAN NEVER KNOW EVER. BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW IS THAT IS THAT OUT THERE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE RIGHT SO DR SCOTT DESCRIBED THE CALVET BROKE GROUND THIS WAS THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THANKS TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LEGISLATURE- FOR. CREATING A DRAWDOWNS FIVE MILLION FROM THE STATE FORTY FIVE NINE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FIFTY MILLION TOTAL FOR POWERHA UP WHICH IS. THIS INFORMATION EXCHANGE ONBOARDING PROGRAM FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS. THOSE FUNDS DO EXPIRE THEY GO AWAY IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE THOSE FUNDS WERE ENABLED BY THE HIGH TECH PROGRAM OR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH IS THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED HIGH TECH WAS A BILL WITHIN IT. AND IT ENABLED AND SUPPORTED THEY HAD AN AND DR SCOTT WENT THROUGH THIS VERY LONG WITH THE A PROGRAMS THAT IT WAS THAT ENABLED. ONE OF WHICH WAS JUST NINETY TEN FUNDING STREAM FOR HIV. THAT FUNDING STREAM. WILL GO AWAY IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITHOUT ANY CHANGE UNLESS SOME CHANGE THAT ARE MADE A I DON'T. AND I WOULD HAVE TO BE UT OF THE CHANGE UP OFF THE FUN STREAM THEN STATUS MEAN THAT ALL FUNDING OPTIONS INCLUDING. TEN FUNDING UP GO AWAY THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF NINETY TEN OR SEVENTY THIRTY OR FIFTY FIFTY MATCHES. WE COULD POTENTIALLY TAP INTO. AND A STRAIGHT FOR. MEANING THEY HAVE TO BE TIED TO THINGS LIKE THE MEDICAID- ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS SO YOU YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CASE. CALIFORNIA THAT. FEDERAL DOLLARS BEING ACCESSED THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR CHANNEL. I REALLY GOING TO SUPPORT MEDICAID ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS. WHICH COULD BE LIKE AN ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT SYSTEM IT COULD BE A PAYMENT SYSTEM BUT- THE DOORS ARE. ARE ARE ARE NARROWER. WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE PAYMENT STREAMS- THAT HIGH TECH NINETY TEN FUNDING TO DEPART EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER WAS. DIRECTED AND DEDICATED TO THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING AWAY. OKAY THANK YOU. AND MR BONTA TOOK ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WHICH WAS A GOOD GOOD FOR HIM BUT- AND WELL AS WELL DOWN ON HIS SIDE ON HIS HANDS. BUT YOU GO BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE QUESTION ACTUALLY HAD FOR MR HORROCKS AND THAT IS- BUT BUT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST BECAUSE YOU'VE ADDED NEW INFORMATION HERE. YOU KNOW YOU'VE TO TALK ABOUT THAT IT'S COSTLY FOR SMALL SMALL PROVIDERS IT'S COSTLY FOR SMALL HOSPITALS TO. DO TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS TO GET THIS GOING BUT ALSO TO MAINTAIN IT AS WELL. AND THAT THERE ISN'T A COMPELLING BUSINESS MODEL FOR THAT- FOR THIS FOR THOSE ENTITIES IS THAT A FAIR. SO YES. SO OBVIOUSLY DH CS HAS A HAS A HAS A BIG INTEREST IN THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE THIRTEEN MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. YOU WHO ELSE HAS A BIG INTEREST IN THIS AND HOW DOES THAT HELP THE CONSUMER ON THE OTHER END. WELL YOU'RE WEARING ONE OF THEM THE COVER CALIFORNIA HAS A BUSINESS INTEREST THE CASE. THAT INFORMATION EXCHANGE CAN PROVIDE VALUE THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY HELP REDUCE UNNECESSARY UTILIZATION COSTS IS AS THEY PARKS MENTIONED THERE IS EVIDENCE OUT THERE. IT IS IT IS- IT'S NOT SO CONVINCING THAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA SAY THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IT IS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT BUT THERE ARE. CASES AND THAT REPORT- THAT- YOU REFERENCE THE BEGINNING OF MY TESTIMONY. HAD A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES AND CITATIONS FOR- FOR RESEARCH STUDIES FROM THAT EARLY MARKET MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION. ABOUT SOME OF THE SAVINGS- FROM HIV SO THERE. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THAT- THAT DOLLARS CAN BE SAVED AND OUTCOMES CAN BE IMPROVED AND UTILIZATION UNNECESSARY UTILIZATION CAN BE DECREASED. SO THERE'S A BUSINESS INTEREST ON FROM- FROM COVER CALIFORNIA'S PERSPECTIVE- TO TRY TO MANAGE TO KEEP COSTS AND PREMIUMS DOWN. FOR ALL THE BENEFICIARIES WILL ACCESS COVERAGE THROUGH THE MARKET PLACE. AND BUT ALSO TO CREATE THESE- THESE- THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THESE PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAMS SHOULD SAVINGS PROGRAMS. MUCH OF WHICH RELY ON EXCHANGING INFORMATION- ACROSS VARIOUS PARTIES AND SO AND SO YOU HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA'S CALPERS CAL IS ANOTHER LARGE PURCHASER IN THE STATE- THEY'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS IN SOME OF THEIR INNOVATIVE- PAYMENT PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S AROUND- WHETHER IT'S AROUND THERE- I CAN PUT YOUR ORGANIZATION WITH BLUE SHIELD AND DIGNITY AND- HEAL PHYSICIANS. THEY'VE SHOWN REAL SAVINGS- AND CREATING THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH REQUIRE. INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITHIN THAT NETWORK OF PROVIDERS AND PLANS. SO THERE ARE THEIR PURCHASERS LIKE CALPERS AND EVEN PRIVATE PURCHASERS WHO WOULD BE WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF TOTAL COST OF CARE- AND BEING ABLE TO EXCHANGE MORE INFORMATION TO MANAGE MORE COMPLEX PICTURE SO PURCHASERS ALL AROUND REALLY QUICK BENEFIT. BUT THAT THE IMPLEMENTERS ARE BROADER THAN PURCHASERS YOU'VE GOT AS WE MENTIONED PROVIDERS AND OTHERS WHO HAVE TO PUT THESE TOOLS IN PLACE AND THEN USE THEM AND INTEGRATE THEM INTO THEIR WORKFLOWS AND THAT'S CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL PRACTICE. GREAT WHAT WHAT THANK YOU AND THAT THIS IS REALLY HELPFUL I MEAN I'M- I'M I'M SEEING THIS AS A AS A AS A AS AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT IN- OUR EFFORTS AS A STATE TO HELP MANAGE THE OVERALL. AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTHCARE SO. NONE OF THESE BY THEMSELVES IS THE MAGIC BULLET ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WORKING. THINGS LIKE THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. ALL OF THESE THINGS NEED TO BE FIRING ON ALL THE SAME CYLINDERS FOR US TO HELP GET THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT WE'RE GOING TO HOPE TO ACHIEVE. AS WE AS WE LOOK TO BEND THE CURVE- ON ON THE COST OF THE COST OF HEALTHCARE SO. SO THAT THAT'S MY TAKE AWAY IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF IT. BUT IT IS NOT A MAGIC BULLET THERE IS NO MAGIC BULLET THERE'S A LOT OF MAGIC BULLETS I GUESS WE JUST NEED HIM ALL THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME SO. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FREE INFORMATION AND IT WAS KIND OF A GREAT SUMMARY TO WHERE WE- WHERE FROM WHERE WE STARTED FROM SO. IT CERTAINLY TAKES A LOT TO THERE'S A LOT HERE AND IT'S A COMPLICATED SUBJECTS ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THEIR SHIP AND SHIP. THANK YOU. SO WITH THAT.

TOTAL INCLUDES OTHER SUPPORT- THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACROSS THE STATE. BUT OTHER NON PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN TO SHOP MISSION IS TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THAT IS HIGH QUALITY AND STATE THE PORTABLE. AND OBVIOUSLY SHARING PATIENT HEALTH RECORDS IS A CRITICAL PART THAT MISSION. R. FOUR MILLION MEMBERS AND IN FACT ALL CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE RECORDS IN A SEAMLESS DIGITAL BILL TIME FORMAT. AND IT IS THE MISSING LINK THAT WILL ALLOW OUR HOSPITAL AND PHYSICIAN PARTNERS TO SHARE AND MUSICAL IN THE NATION AND DO THINGS LIKE. REDUCE UNNECESSARY CATCHES YOUR BUDGETS TO AVOID COSTLY MISSIONS AND A GOOD PATIENT OUTCOMES AND WOULD ALSO ADD THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE THE STATE WITH LOW BUSTY INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADDRESS PUBLIC PUBLIC AND SHE'S LIKE ME COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC.

AT THE NONPROFIT WORKING WITH SAFETY NET PROVIDERS- BELIEVE THERE'S TWO POINTS I WANTED TO QUICKLY MAKE AROUND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ONE IS- YOU CAN'T BE INTEROPERABLE WHEN YOU'RE NOT OPERABLE- WE FEEL FINE BECAUSE OF UNDERFUNDING PUBLIC HEALTH- H. I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE MANY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE RUNNING OLDER SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO EVEN EXCHANGE DATA- ON THE BALLOT BASIC LEVEL AND SO- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FUNDING FOR UPGRADING EHR SYSTEMS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. ALSO HIV HAS GOT TO BE VERY VERY SIMPLE AND VERY LOW COST OTHERWISE IT WON'T BE USED REDUCING THE TIME AND TIME AGAIN ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT. AGE I- WOULD CONTINUE TO SOUND THEY OPEN SOMETHING CLOSE TO SO AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS EXPLORING- THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE H. ID WE LOOK FORWARD TO BE PARTY PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WHAT A GREAT PANEL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT CALLER PLEASE. OUR NEXT TOWN COME FROM NUMBERS. TWO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU READ THE WITH PERMANENTE A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR VARYING HEARING TODAY OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX TOPIC IN A RAPIDLY EVOLVING LANDSCAPE AND CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN THIS AREA AND YOU'VE HEARD WITH SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND KAISER PERMANENTE A AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE EARLY LEADER IN THIS SPACE AND THIS YEAR ALONE WE HAVE EXCHANGE HEALTH INFORMATION OVER NINETY THREE MILLION HìNH LET THEM CALIFORNIA ITH OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PHYSICIAN PRACTICES AND OTHER PROVIDERS SITE OUTSIDE OF OUR SYSTEM. ACROSS THE STATE YOU DID IT THE THING THAT WORK THE CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE NATION AND BUILD ON OUR SUCCESS IN STATEWIDE DATA SHARING ACROSS THE HEALTH SYSTEM BUT WE MUST PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY AS WE EXPLORE THE NEXT STEPS TO GET THAT UNIVERSAL ROBUST DATA SHARING THAT WE ALL WANT. UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN RELY ON THE EXISTING PROVEN SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY IS THAT THE MARKET BOARD THAT DOCTORS THE DNC REFERRED TO THE WORKING WELL FOR ALMOST ALL PROVIDERS IN THE STATE BUT WE DO NEED TO BETTER LEVERAGE AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT GREATER ADOPTION OF THAT TECHNOLOGY AND BETTER EDUCATE PROVIDERS ABOUT THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND WE'RE ALSO FORTUNATE TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR AND WELL THOUGHT OUT NATIONAL STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT- AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPTION OF THAT WILL MAKE IT EVEN EASIER TO SHARE INFORMATION. AND WE DO AGREE THAT SAFETY NET PROVIDERS AND SMALL AND RURAL PHYSICIAN PRACTICES WILL NEED SUPPORT TO GET AND STAY CONNECTED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE- AND OTHERS ON SCHOOL CONCRETE IDEAS WE HAVE IN THAT SPACE. AND WE ALSO AGREED THAT A SEPARATE BUT RELATED ISSUE IS THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH DATA FLOWS BEEN WORK ALSO HAPPY TO OFFER OUR EXPERTISE IN IN THAT FACES WELL BUT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUE WILL REQUIRE A DIFFERENT TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS IN DIFFERENT FUNDING SOLUTION FELT. I THINK THE BEST CAN YOU IT WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT. PINPOINT THE VERY THAT MAKE IT UP FOR PROVIDE TO CONNECT. AND THEN THE- CAN BE DESIGN TO ADDRESS PARK THOSE HOW WHICH WILL. REALLY VERY ACROSS OUR LARGE INCOME THEY- AND THE APPROACHES AND SOMETHING STATE THAT MAY NOT WORK SO WE NEED TO AVOID. ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THAT WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON YOUR MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALL. THE BUILDING THE CLUES WE ARE HAD AN PLACE THANK HELL FOR THE WEEK GET THAT. UNIVERSE OKAY. THAT WE BEEN WORK TOWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. OUR NEXT COMMENT WILL COMPLY SIXTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO DOCTOR WOULD AND MEMBERS ENGAGED YET HERE ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE HEARING A LOT OF INFORMATION HAS BEEN PRESENTED AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE ULTIMATE GOAL IN TRYING TO ACCESS HI NEED CLINICAL HEALTH INFORMATION- AT THE A NEW WE DO BELIEVE MEANINGFUL AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE IS NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL TO BRINGING DOWN. ESCALATING HEALTHCARE COSTS WHICH CONTINUE TO HAMPER OUR WORKERS ABILITY TO SECURE WAGE INCREASES AT THE BARGAINING TABLE BUT IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE TOOL THAT PROVIDES THE CLINICAL INFORMATION NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND- PATIENT. ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS ACTUALLY EXPOSED IS THE LACK OF INFORMATION WHICH LEADS TO FRAGMENTATION AND IT ALSO IT CREATES HUGE CHALLENGES FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS PROVIDING HEALTH SERVICES AND HOSPITAL CLINICS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN OTHER SETTINGS. I DO KNOW THIS IS VERY ALARMING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE TIME THE ACCESS AND DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE AND BEAUTY AND WEBER HOPES SERVICES HEY AND AS YOU ALSO KNOW OUR WORKERS PROVIDE CARE IN VARIOUS PUBLIC COUNTY AND PRIVATE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS WHICH USED DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THAT MAY CREATE LAGGED IN ACCESS BEING. PATIENT HEALTH. INFORMATION WHAT DEPENDING ON WHERE THE PAY ACTUALLY AND- THE DIFFERENT DELIVERY. THAT WE- OUR BURKE ALL MAY NOT NECESSARY HAVE THE REAL HI ACCESS TO INFORMATION. SO FAR. WHEN A PATIENT HAS THAT THE PA FOR CARBON NINETEEN IT'S NOT OFTEN AVAILABLE TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS AS PART OF THE PATIENT HEALTH RECORDS. WHICH THEN EXPLODED HEALTHCARE WORKERS- IN THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT THAT. A BILL WITH THE PATIENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE BUT KOGAN NINETEEN. AND SO WITH THAT SAID WE DO THINK- THAT THERE COULD BE INVESTMENT INSTRUCTORS THAT DELIVER TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO ENSURE PATIENTS HAVE CARE AND ALSO TO ENSURE THE- SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT NEXT CALLER PLEASE. WHEN IT COMES ONE SIX FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WOULD AND- D. COMMITTEE THIS IS CLAUDIA WILLIAMS AND ITS CEO OF MANIFEST NOT ACT. AND THAT IS THE QUALITY OF THE STATEWIDE HIV BUT PROVIDERS IN THIRTY EIGHT AT THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES. SERVING OVER A HUNDRED HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS ACROSS THE STATE WE SHARE DATA FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS TODAY AND THAT HAS BLOCKED YOUR POINTED OUT WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS SINCE HIS THAT REPORT FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO. I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS HEARING AS A FIRST STEP TO REALLY ENGAGING THE WHOLE STATE AND CRAFTING A SOLUTION THAT WORKS. FOR CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION TO THE IMPORTANT GOAL THE PARTY DISCUSSED TODAY- I THINK IT'S WORK IT'S CRITICAL TO ACCELERATE HEALTHEQUITY. ENHANCE PATIENT CARE AND ALSO THE TWO POINTS THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN MADE PROFOUNDLY- TO SUPPORT. PUBLIC HEALTH AND REDUCE COSTS. WE'RE REALLY BUSCA. OTHERS I THINK WE'D MAKE PROGRESS. BUT I WANNA YES CAPTURE. AND WHILE I THINK THERE'S SCOPE. IN THE- AT THE END OF. WHAT REALLY GREAT IS THE CUT WE ARE NOT A FIRST MOVER WE HAVE INCREDIBLE MODELS AND MODE MAPS FROM OTHER STATES AS WELL AS- SHARED BY DAVID FOR APPS. I WANTED TO DEEPER PEOPLE YOU MENTIONED FIVE THINGS THAT I THINK THOSE MODEL SHELAGH. TICKET STATEWIDE. WE CAN AFFORD WHAT SPACE. THE LETTER LOOK FOR THE MANDATE AND INCENTIVES THAT LOOK UP TO A 100% PARTICIPATION. TO LEVERAGE WHAT WE FELT. WE DON'T HAVE A DECADE AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUILD FROM SCRATCH SO LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE AND FIGURE OUT. HOW TO USE THAT. THIRD I THINK OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH AND COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDER CARE POINT OF CARE THOSE ARE SUCH IMPORTANT USE CASES AT THE STATE SPEND NEXT YEAR AND YEARS PAST THAT. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES IN OTHER STATES GET 5280% OF FUNDING FROM FEDERAL SOURCES. AND WHILE WE SORT OF MISSED THE BOAT AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE NINETY TEN HIGH TECH THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE. AND FINALLY FREE UP THE PUBLIC HEALTH DATA MANY OTHER STATES ARE TAKING THEIR THEIR REGISTRY DATA FROM CAL READY. TYPE REGISTRIES AND THEN YOU GET TO H. I EAT THE WE CAN ALERT PROVIDERS SO THAT THE HUGE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE- TO REALLY- HELP WITH THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME NUMBER REALLY EXCITED. TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE YEAR I HAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU AND AS LES GENERAL YORK PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO EXT KAMU COME FROM ONE OF SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

I WOULD WORK FOR THAT I'M AWARE OF THE INMATE POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS THAT I'D BE THE RECIDIVISM STATISTICS I HAVE SEEN THAT IT IS A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE AT THE VERY ONES WHO HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMING CONSISTENTLY AND THEY HAVE FULFILLED THEIR TO THEIR ARM AND IN MOST CASES CONTINUE THEIR CONFINEMENT MANY YEARS BEYOND THEIR TERMS. THAT THESE PRINTERS ARE NOT EVEN CONSIDERED FOR ANY KIND OF A VERY DEEP OF THEIR DEBT THAT'S BEEN FULLY PAID AND THEN SOME THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE LIFERS IN THIS EQUATION AT ALL RELEASED. EVEN DO NOT REACH TO PRISON THEY ARE OLD WHY AND HAVE THE- MORE. RESPONSE BEEN. WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR HEAD. OF FIRING BUT EVEN BEYOND. THE OVER POP. IS SOMETHING WILL NOT GO AWAY WITH THE BACK.
