YOUR PREFERENCES -- THANK YOU MISTER BELL AND POLICE OBVIOUSLY KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THE PHYSICAL OR YOUR WITNESSES TO THE FISCAL. AND WITH THAT WILL OPEN UP ON SP. FIVE GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MISTER CHAIRMAN. SP FIVE IS PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS SO. THE THE CENTER REQUIRE AN I. R. HAVE INTRODUCES SURE HE'S THE JOINT OFFER WITH ME ON THIS BILL. THE PACKAGE IS BASED ON INPUT GATHERED THROUGH A SERIES OF PUBLIC HEARINGS WE COULD WE CONVENED ACROSS THE STATE THIS FALL. THE DEALS WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENT. AND FOR ABOUT HOUSING INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA -- THE LACK OF INVESTMENT HAS HAD A OVERALL NEGATIVE FISCAL EFFECT ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BY -- FEELING TO PRODUCE THE NECESSARY. HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS PER YEAR. COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO LOCATE CALIFORNIA IF THEY CAN'T. PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS RESULTS -- ALSO. ANOTHER CAUSES INCURRED BY GOVERNMENT THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ON THE STREETS LAST YEAR. AND OUT OF TWO POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE LOW INCOME OR VERY LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS. THEY'RE COMPETING FOR SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES SO. THIS IS. A TREMENDOUS IMPACT [inaudible] ON THE LOWER INCOME. RESIDENTS THE CALIFORNIA. AND IT LEAVES A HUNDRED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LOIS INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING. AND RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS REQUIRING MORE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY. TO ON THE OTHER SIDE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO BUILD SHELTERS. AND SHORT TERM HOUSING IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. INEFFICIENT WITHOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF PERMANENT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO THIS BILL MAKES THE STATE A LONG TERM. FINANCIAL PARTNER. TO MERELY CONSTRUCTS THE NEEDED HOUSING FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS. BUILDS UP -- TO EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND REHABILITATED HOUSING UNITS -- AND IS SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO COLLABORATE. ON STATE APPROVED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS WOULD CREEP WHICH SHOULD BE FUNDED BY REDUCING. THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO THE EDUCATIONAL REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUN. ZERO INFERENCES WILL BE PAID. TO THE HOUSING OF THE NEEDY LOW VERY LOW. AND MODERATE INCOME AS WELL AS TRANSIT OUR PRIORITY PROJECTS. SP FIVE CREATES A CAP ON FUNDS -- VILLE IT NOW VIA ITS -- PROPOSING A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN. AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM HAS RAMPED UP THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND SPENDING. CANNOT EXCEED TWO MILLION BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THE STATE GENERAL FUND WOULD BE TO BACK FILL THE SCHOOL LAW SCHOOL REVENUE. THE LEGISLATURE UNDER THE BILL CAN SUSPEND -- PLANS DURING FISCAL DOWNTURNS. THAT SOUND LIKE REDEVELOPMENT LOG THE FISCAL. REVENUE FOR REDEVELOPMENT WOULD JUST CONTINUE ON WITHOUT ANY CONTROL BY THE STATE THIS ALLOWS. A SUSPENSION. THE BILL ALIGNS. WITH OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS WE NOW HAVE. TO INSURE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL NON STATE GENERAL FUNDS. THESE INVESTMENTS GENERATE. IN TEN OF FEDERAL FUNDS ABOUT THREE TIMES THE INVESTMENT. OF OF THE STATE SO FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAX CREDIT PROGRAM SO IF YOU INVEST ONE DOLLAR YOU'RE GETTING THREE DOLLARS ADDITIONAL. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAX CREDITS. THE LEGISLATION ALSO ROSE WITH SCHOOL COUNT ABILITY PROVISIONS MISTER CHAIRMAN AND TO ENSURE FUNDS AND ALWAYS SPENT ON DISNEY PROJECTS. AND OR NOT OR OR IT'S A STATE COMMITTEE. TO REVIEW AND MONITOR THE FISCAL -- OVER START ON PART OF THE STATE -- THE COMMITTEE IS EMPOWERED TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH LOCALS DO NOT MEET YOUR PLANET CHAPTERS. AND THOSE THOSE ISSUES ARE NOT ADDRESSED IN ANY REDEVELOPMENT. LAW WAS NOT ADDRESSED -- READ% THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT LOST SO THIS PUTS THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. AND THE STRONG CONTROL BY THE STATE. AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING OF REDEVELOPMENT RESTORED. IN CALIFORNIA SO I HAVE A TURTLE MY WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN -- WE HAVE DOWNTOWN MUSHI FROM THE CARPENTERS AND LEAGUE OF CITIES ALSO. HIS REPRESENTATIVES OF DOWNTURN OVER YOUR BRAIN PLEASE OBVIOUSLY FISCAL ISSUES. GOOD MORNING SENATORS -- DAN KELLUM GM A RESEARCHER WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS REGIONAL COUNCIL -- WE'RE PLEASED TO OFFER OUR SUPPORT FOR SP. FIVE AND ALSO TO SHARE WITH YOU THE RESULTS OF A STUDY THAT WE DID IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. WERE USED IN IN PLAN INPUT OUTPUT MODEL TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE DIRECT INVESTMENTS. AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE FUNDS FROM SENATE BILL FIVE AS IT WAS INTRODUCED. OUR MODEL IS BASED ON ANALYSIS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. AND LIKE THE PROGRAM WE EXPECT THE STATE'S DIRECTEMENT DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM SP FIVE TO BE LEVERAGED OVER THREE TIMES FROM LOW INCOME TAX CREDITS. FROM OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS FROM OTHER LOCAL SOURCES AND FROM PRIVATE FUNDS. THESE INVESTMENTS COULD TRANSLATE INTO OVER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. INCLUDING OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT PER YEAR BY. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OUR ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE THESE INVESTMENTS CAN PRODUCE OVER EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND REHABILITATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE. TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOME AND SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND JOBS. INCLUDING A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND FAMILY SUPPORTING PREVAILING WAGE CONSTRUCTION JOBS WITH HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS WHILE OPENING UP APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND OTHER FOLKS JUST BEGINNING THEIR CONSTRUCTION CAREERS. SP FIVE WILL NOT ONLY HELP US MEET THE STATE'S URGENT NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ITS EFFECTS WILL RIPPLE THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY. WILL RESULT IN MORE JOBS INCREASED CONSUMER SPENDING AND MORE TAX REVENUE IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN STATES CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK FORCE OUR HOUSING MARKET AND OUR ECONOMY. AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS ARE PLEASE TO OFFER OUR SUPPORT THANKS THANKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M DAVID SANDER I'M VICE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF RANCHO CORDOVA ALTHOUGH COME YOU'RE WEARING SEVERAL HATS. I HAVE SERVED AS CHAIR OF THE REGIONAL TRANSIT DISTRICT HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION I AM ALSO THE CURRENT CHAIR OF SAY COG WHICH IS THE COG FOR THE SACRAMENTO REGION. I'VE SERVED ON THE LC BOARD AND LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES BOARD. AND I HAVE SERVED AS A POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THEM IN TERMS OF OLD SUBURBAN ISSUES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. AND SO I'M COMING TO YOU TODAY AS A PERSON IS WEARING MANY HATS BECAUSE OF ICE WHERE VENTURA. WHERE WE HAVE FULL SYMBOL OF ART IN THE HEART OF OUR OLD SUBURB OLD COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR? IN DESPERATE NEED OF REINVENTION -- WE HAVE SOUGHT ABOUT TO DO THAT SINCE OUR CORPORATION TWO THOUSAND TWO AND FOUND A GREAT NUMBER OF BARRIERS NOW THIS IS A BOWL OF OUR YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE IT'S JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE. WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR MILES OF TRANSIT STRETCHING ALONG THAT OLD COMMERCIAL QUARTER THAT USED TO BE HIGHWAY FIFTY BUT NO LONGER AS OTHER SIX LIGHT RAIL STATIONS ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND WE ARE UNABLE DUE TO ECONOMICS. TO STIMULATE ANY SORT OF TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT AT THOSE STATIONS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT MOTIVATES ME TO COME BEFORE YOU HEARD TODAY. AS CHAIR OF SAY COG -- WE ARE AWARE THAT WE NEED TO DECREASE OUR GREEK GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACT -- AND INCREASE THE REDUCTION 219% SOURCES SAY CUT REGION WHERE DESPERATELY STUDYING HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THAT. IN OUR REGION AND THE ANSWER IS ABOUT 75% OF OUR EFFORT OUGHT TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS INFILL. FOR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AGENCY BUT IN PHIL IS THE SOLUTION ALLOWING PEOPLE LIVE CLOSER TO JOBS HIS RANCH ROVERS JOB RICH -- AND NOT HAVE THOSE LONG COMMUTE -- DISTANCES IN THEIR COMMUTES. SO HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THIS. I'M WELL AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND I CAN TELL YOUR BRIEF STORY ABOUT WHAT LOOKS LIKE IN MY COMMUNITY WHERE JOBS RICH WE HAVE A GROWING GREEN EDGE IN RANCHO CORDOVA WE HAVE A LARGE OLD URBAN SUBURBAN. CORRIDOR AND NEED TO RE INVENTION A RESTAURANT WANTED TO COME ON ONE PARTICULAR SIDE OF TOWN THEY WERE ALSO INTEREST IN BEING AND IN FULL SIGHT. IT TURNS OUT THEIR COSTS FOR THAT IN FULL SIGHT ROUGHLY DOUBLE OF WHAT THE GREENFIELD COST ONCE. AND IT WAS DOUBLE BECAUSE THEY FOUND SITUATIONS LIKE -- YES THE REPLACING OLD RESTAURANT THAT WAS THERE AND THERE WAS A GREASE TRAP ALREADY IN PLACE BUT THE SEWER DISTRICT AND STATE REGULATIONS. AND STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT YOU REPLACE THAT OLD NINETEEN SIXTIES GREEK GREASE TRAP SO THAT IT MEETS THE REGULATIONS WERE PASSED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND THE COST OF DOING SO TURNING IT FROM A SIX FOOT TRAPPED UNDER SIX AND A HALF FOOT TRAP WOULD COST THAT RESTAURANT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS REPEATED ON THROUGH EIGHTY A THROUGH -- POWER NEEDS THROUGH WATER NEEDS THROUGH DRAINAGE MEANS VARIOUS DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS NOT UNDER CONTROL OF THE CITY UNTIL THE COST OF THAT INFO RESTAURANT WAS LITERALLY DOUBLE. WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN GREENFIELD SORTED IT END UP OBVIOUSLY IN GREENFIELD THAT WAS THE ONLY THING? THAT IS ECONOMICALLY POSSIBLE. SO MY CITY IS HERE ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WERE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE NEED TO SEE THAT IN FILL DEVELOPMENT WE NEED TO SEE THAT HOUSING ON OUR OLD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS AND ASSURE SAY COG. AND IN MY NATIONAL POST I CAN TELL YOU EVERY JURISDICTION IN OUR STATE EVERY JURISDICTION IN THE COUNTRY IS FACING THE SAME CHALLENGE HOW DO YOU REINVEST ALONG THESE OLD SUBURBAN CORRIDORS. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION SP FIVE IS CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT WILL HELP US KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS IT'LL DO THINGS AS AS BORING AS FINANCE THE REPLACEMENT OF AGREE STRAP -- WITHOUT ARGUING THE SPECIFICS OF IT BUT THOSE SORTS OF BARRIERS ARE WHAT STOP US FROM STARTING. TRANSFERRING TO THE HOME IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE THINK THIS BILL WILL HELP NOT ONLY US BUT A LOT OF CITIES IN THE STATE ISSUE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE DO YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION. BUCKLEY ON WE HAVE A THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT.

SEEING NONE FINANCE THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STILL UNITARY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE DON'T HAVE A FILE ON THIS MEASURE. ANY QUESTIONS. GO AHEAD MR CASH CAN BE. CENTRE BELL YOUR PROPONENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT -- THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING OTHER -- FEDERAL FUNDS PRIVATE FUNDS OTHER FUNDS BEING LEVERAGE LEVERAGE -- TO INCREASE THE POOL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT IF. THESE FUNDS WERE NOT WE WERE NOT INVADING THE E. WRAPPED AND WE SIMPLY LET'S SAY -- MODIFIED SP TWO FROM LAST YEAR SO WE ACTUALLY DO CATCH EVERY TRANSACTION THE SALE NEW SALES THAT WOULD CREATE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WOULDN'T THOSE FUNDS THAT. YOU'RE PROPONENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEVERAGE WOULD THAT ALSO BE LEVERAGE AVAILABLE -- FOR THE DEVELOPERS -- I CAN PROPOSE A BOWL OF BILL THAT HAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE OR A COUPLE OF A BILL THAT -- HAS A MAJORITY VOTE. CERTAINLY WE HAD. NEW TAX REVENUE FROM SOMEWHERE -- THAT REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE -- WHICH IS. CONCEIVABLE NOBODY'S PROPOSE THAT HOWEVER -- I THINK IT COULD BE DONE SURE RIGHT ANY KIND OF NEW REVENUE WOULD [inaudible] ADDITIONALLY -- THE MATCH IT HAS TO BE MATCHED. TO ROGER X. THAT QUALIFY UNDER THE FEDERAL. TAX CREDIT -- PROGRAM. IF THEIR MATCH TO THOSE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT YOU CAN GET THE THE THE HE REVENUE FROM THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT. IT'S ABOUT THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU INVEST IN THIS BOOK PERHAPS IF WE LOOKED AT THE CAPTAIN TREAT HIS ONE YEAR PROPONENTS IS TALKING ABOUT -- TRANSITORY AT DEVELOPMENT FOR MAYBE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IF THE FLOOR OF A CAP AND TRADE WOULD GO FROM FIFTEEN DOLLARS TO THIRTY DOLLARS THAT WOULD DOUBLE THE REVENUE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SO WOULD. THE CURRENTLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION IT GOES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH WOULD DOUBLE TO ONE POINT TWO MILLION WOULDN'T THOSE FUNDS BE AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME TAX CREDITS. PRIVATE FUNDS IN OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS DOUBLING THE AMOUNT A TRANSITORY IN DEVELOPMENT IS AT THE TIME I'M THINKING ABOUT THE MECHANISM OF ALL THE REVENUE INCREASE TAX -- ANY KIND OF REVENUE INCREASE EXPANDING THE TOP MAKING THE TAX CREDIT. WHICH REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE AGAIN. THAT CAN BE DONE IT COULD BE ANY KIND OF REVENUE LIKE THAT. IS A COULD BE MATCHED WITH FEDERAL -- FEDERAL FUNDS LIKE I LIKE TO POINT OUT THE I HAVE NOT SEEN A PROPOSAL DOING THAT IT CAN BE DONE [inaudible] HOWEVER -- WELL WE DO NEED WHAT WE DO KNOW WE NEED IS AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT STUDY ON GOING. AND SET UP IN A WAY WHERE CAN EASILY USE BY CITIES WHICH TH STARS. SO THE THIS. PROPOSAL DOES NOT REQUIRE -- THE TWO THIRDS VOTE THAT DO YOU. WOULD REQUIRE FOR THOSE OTHER ITEMS WELL I MISSED THREE CHURCH I DON'T BELIEVE CAP AND TRADE AUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY THE COURTS TO NOT BE IFFY AND NOT BE ATTACKS WOULD REQUIRE TWO THIRDS BUT I JUST WANTTO KNOW. THE MECHANISMS THAT TREE THAT YOU -- PEOPLE YES AGREE WITH THAT BUT OKAY -- FIGHTING. DID YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I THINK -- I THINK GO WITH UNLIMITED REDEVELOPMENT IN THE CRISIS THAT WE HAD IN THE BUDGET I MEAN WE HAD. WE HAD A GROUP OF PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE -- COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS -- IT RICK IT DID NOT. IT HAS SOME FAILINGS. AND THIS BILL -- WINDSOR REQUIRE AND I WENT OUT AND LOOKED AT VARIOUS WAYS WE TRIED. TO DEVISE A WAY WHERE WE CAN CORRECT THOSE PROBLEMS. MAKE CORRECTIONS AND MAKE IT PHYSICALLY MORE RESPONSIBLE. AND WE CAME UP WITH THIS BILL. AND IN MY AREA -- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE PASSED HOUSING MEASURES. HOWEVER THE STATE NEEDS TO COME UP WITH WITH THEIR FAIR SHARE. OF REVENUE SO WE NEED TO BE A PARTNER ON ON GOING BASIS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL THIS IS THE ONLY BILL THAT ACTUALLY DOES THAT. THAT'S OUT NOW PENDING IN THE LEGISLATORS GONE THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE SO. THIS IS THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A IN MY AREA -- THE DISINVESTMENT IN MY AREA IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN MEASURE FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT. WHEN A COMPANY RELOCATES TO ANOTHER AREA? AND A HIGH TECH AREA BECAUSE OF THEY DON'T HAVE HOUSING. BUT IT IS. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR RELOCATION. OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY [inaudible] THE HI TECH COMPANIES THAT I REPRESENT IN MY AREA IT'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON. SO I REGION I VOTE ON THIS THIS WOULD HELP THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT TO THE STATE ON A PHYSICAL BASIS. THANK YOU MISTER BELL I WOULD NOTE THAT -- I WAS ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT VOTE TO DISSOLVE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES BACK WHEN I WAS ON THE TABLE SO I'M. PROUD OF MY POSITION THEN IN FACT THEN I SAID HOW CAN YOU DO AWAY WITH THE STATE'S ONLY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT. AND HERE WE ARE A DECADE LATER STILL TRYING TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT SO -- CERTAINLY IN CONCEPT -- YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE A FRIENDLY FRIENDLY CHAIR THIS IS A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE TEN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD WITH MISTER MCGUIRE.
