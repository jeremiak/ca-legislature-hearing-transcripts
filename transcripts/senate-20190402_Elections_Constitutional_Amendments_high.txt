SIR SIR LABOR -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GOING TO CONVENE AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WE'RE GOING -- TO START WITH THE CENTER REQUIRES SP. FIVE TWENTY THREE AND THEN WE'LL CONTINUE TO HOPE AND BESEECH OTHER MEMBERS. TO APPEAR. ALL RIGHT [inaudible] CINEMA CHOIR [inaudible] WHAT? THANK YOU SO MUCH AS THE CHAIR IN. MADAM SENATOR VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE AT SECURITY HUNTING MOMENT SAY THANK YOU. FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AND YOUR STAFF TEAMS WORK ON THIS BILL -- IN I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IS FOR A STRONG DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON THE VOTERS BELIEVE THAT THEIR BALLOT COUNTS AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE PEDIA IS WELL. AS YOU MAY REMEMBER WE ARE IN FRONT OF THIS DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE LAST YEAR REQUIRING ELECTION OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY VOTERS. OF MISMATCHING SIGNATURES AT LEAST EIGHT DAYS PRIOR TO AN ELECTION. AND ALSO GIVE THE VOTER AN OPPORTUNITY TO VERIFY THE SIGNATURE. WHAT WE KNEW LAST YEAR -- AND THAT BILL BY THE WAY WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR IS IT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BALLOTS WERE TOSSED. OUT BECAUSE OF A MISMATCH SIGNATURE THIS YEAR WE'RE BACK WITH A ECOND VOTER EMPOWERMENT DALE PARTNERING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. ON BALANCE THEY DON'T HAVE A SIGNATURE INCLUDED. IN THE GOLDEN STATE ROBERT HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS NOW VOTE BY MAIL BECAUSE OF THE MISSING BALLOTS WERE REJECTED IN THE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ELECTION. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE IN THIS MODERN DAY. SIGNATURE ISSUES SUCH AS A MISSING SIGNATURE IS ONE OF THE TOP REASONS THAT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ARE REJECTED. FOLKS MAY NOT KNOW THAT THEIR SIGNATURES USED TO VERIFY THEIR BALANCE. IN THAT CREATES A PROBLEM UNIQUE TO THOSE WHO VOTE BY MAIL. SP FIVE TWENTY THREE REQUIRES ELECTION OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY VOTERS OF THE MISSING SIGNATURE AT LEAST EIGHT DAYS PRIOR TO CERTIFICATION OF AN ELECTION. IN PROVIDE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO VERIFY THE SINGER UP TO TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION. THIS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TIME FOR VOTERS TO CORRECT A MISSING SIGNATURE AND PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY TO COUNTIES TO NOTIFY VOTERS. AND THAT'S THE OTHER IMPORTANT WORD IS NOTIFY RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN NOTIFYING THESE FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOLKS THAT THEIR BALLOT IS ABOUT TO BE TOSSED. TODAY OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIANS BUT WHEN I MAILED IN SOME COUNTIES CONDUCT ENTIRE ELECTIONS BY MAIL. AND THE USE OF VOTE BY MAIL BOWS INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST ENSURE THAT ALL VOTERS HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO VERIFY THEIR SIGNATURES. MISTER CHAIR AT MADAME SENATOR I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

I'M SORRY SIR SAID I'VE BEEN HERE LESS PART AND CONTAINED YEAH AND I'M ON A POLE I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CALLING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. I HAVE OF OF COMMENTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PASS TALLER IF WE GIVE IT TO SERGEANT. AND IF I MAY READ THAT REAL QUICK IT'S JUST SHORT -- SURE -- HOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA READ IT OURSELVES HOW LONG IS IT? IT'S ONLY ABOUT PAGE. OKAY GO AHEAD OKAY. ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA OF OPPOSES SP FIVE TWENTY THREE THE ELECTIONS VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. THE EXPANSION OF THE CANVASSING TIMELINE FOR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS PROPOSED AN SP. FIVE TWENTY THREE IS UNNECESSARY AND PROBLEMATIC AND WILL LIKELY LEAD TO JUSTIN FRENCH MENTION ON ANTENNA AND INTENDED FRAUDULENT VOTING. THE CURING PROCESS ALREADY IN PLACE PROVIDES ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR VOTE BY MAIL VOTERS THE LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES. THAT VOTERS WHO FAIL TO SIGN THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. OR WHOSE SIGNATURES ON THE ENVELOPE IS DEEMED TO BE A MISMATCH BE NOTIFIED WITHIN EIGHT DAYS. ELECTION DAY AND GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO VALIDATE OR PROVIDE A SIGNATURE SO THAT THEIR BALLOT CAN BE COUNTED. SP FIVE THIRTY OF TWENTY THREE EXPANDS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE REGISTERS HAVE TO NOTIFY THOSE VOTERS. UP TO INCLUDING EIGHT DAYS BEFORE CERTIFICATION AND ALLOWS THE VOTER RESPONSE TO ARRIVE ANYTIME. TO AND INCLUDING IN THEIR TWO DAYS PRIOR TO CERTIFICATION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN REGISTERS FACE UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS FOR BOTH VOTE BY MAIL AND PROVISIONAL BALLOTS AND HAD TO FIND POTENTIALLY. EXTRA EXTRA LEGAL WAYS TO COPE WITH THE NEW TIME LINES WHILE STILL MEETING THE DICTATES OF A FIX CERTIFICATION DATE. SOME REGISTERS FELT FORCED TO BEGIN PROCESSING PROVISIONAL BALLOTS PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF VOTE BY MAIL PROCESSING. IN THE CASE OF A VOTER FOR WHOM THERE WAS APPEARED TO BE BOTH A VOTE BY MAIL. AND A PROVISIONAL BALLOT CAST THESE REGISTERS PROCEEDED. UNDER THE PHILOSOPHY THAT IT WOULD COUNT WHICHEVER BELL IT. MADE IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM FIRST. THIS VERSION OF THE LEGALLY PRESCRIBED PROCESS INTRODUCED THE POTENTIAL OF COUNTING A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. IN LIEU OF A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT AND THUS INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY. THAT A BALLOT NOT CAST FOR THE LEGITIMATE VOTER COULD BE THE ONE COUNTED. FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE VOTE BY MAIL PROCESSING TIME LINE MAKES DEMANDS TO WHICH THE SYSTEM CANNOT PROPERLY ADAPT. AND VOTERS ARE LIKELY TO BE DISENFRANCHISED. AND VOTE FRAUD A BE FACILITATED. THE P. I. C. C. A. APPLAUSE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE. THAT THE VOTES OF ALL ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS BE ACCURATELY COUNTED. HOWEVER WE CAUTION THE LEGISLATURE AGAINST. PRECIPITOUS MOVES THAT ARE BOTH UNNECESSARY AND POTENTIALLY DAMAGING MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST MORE. ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA URGES AND NO ON SP. FIVE TWENTY THREE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME IS GWEN MYERS OUT FROM ROSEVILLE AND I'M OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU -- QUESTIONS THE ELEVENTH. NO QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. SIR MCGUIRE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS EMPOWERING VOTERS. ARE JUST LIKE KITTENS AND APPLE PIE. EVERYONE LIKES IT. AND EVERYONE. WE HAVE A CRISIS IN THIS STATE. FOURTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS FOURTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DID NOT HAVE THEIR VOTES COUNTED REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS LIBERTARIANS GREEN PARTY MEMBERS INCLINED TO STATES. AND WHY ANYONE WOULD BE HERE TODAY ARGUING AGAINST COUNTY BALANCE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE IS CLEAR -- THIS BILL IS ALSO UNDER THE AUSPICES OF A B. EIGHT FORTY WHICH IS CALIFORNIA LAW THAT RT ALLOWS THE VOTERS DID NOT SIGN THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT TO RETURN. A COMPLETED UNSIGNED BALLOT STATEMENT BY EMAIL AND IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE DISCRETION IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE DISCRETION OF THE REGISTER VOTER REFERRING MISMATCHING SIGNATURE THAT THEY BELIEVE WAS FRIED GENTLY SIGNED TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. THOSE GLAD THOSE LAWS OF ART IN PASSING THE STATE -- AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE NO MATTER WHAT PARTY YOU BELONG TO SHOULD BE ON RECORD TO ENSURE THAT EVERY VOTE COUNTS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SIR REQUIRE IT IF YOU SEE -- SENATORS HERTZBERG OR STERN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME IF ONE OF THEM WOULD APPEAR THEN WE COULD FORM A QUORUM AND WILL. PICK UP YOUR MEASURE FOR VOTE SO WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE HUNT. HEY THERE YOU GO THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIR THING -- I SEE SENATOR ALAN HERE. CENTER ELLEN -- AT YOUR SP SIX SIX FOUR IS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. AND THEN OF I WOULD. JUST LIKE TO TAKE UP AS B. FORTY SEVEN FIRST. YES ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND WHEN I'M OBVIOUSLY THINK THE I. THE DILIGENCE STAFF WHO I KNOW AND LOVE WELL FROM MY TIME AS CHAIR OF THIS WONDERFUL COMMITTEE -- FOR THEIR WORK IN HELPING TO PREPARE THE ANALYSIS. THIS IS A BILL THAT -- FOLKS ME RECALL -- FROM LAST YEAR WE'RE FINALLY GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO LANDING THIS PLANE AND I I'M JUST EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND WE WERE. THE THE THE STARS ARE ALIGNING SO THIS BILL REQUIRES SIGNATURE GATHERS TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIA VOTERS. WITH THE NAMES OF THE TOP THREE FOUNDERS OF AN INITIATIVE CAMPAIGN FOLKS MAY REMEMBER THE DISCLOSE ACT WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO -- WHERE WE REQUIRED THE TOP THREE DONORS TO INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES TO BE DISCLOSED ON TV ADS IN ON MAILER SO THAT WHEN YOU GOT A MAILER FROM? CALIFORNIANS FOR MOM AND APPLE PIE YOU KNEW ACTUALLY HE WAS PAYING FOR THE THE CAMPAIGN WELL SIMILARLY WHEN SOMEONE STANDING OUTSIDE THE MARKET AND YOU KNOW I'M FROM SANTA MONICA RIGHT WE WERE GOING TO MARKET TRYING TO GET SOME FARRO OR KEEN WHY SINCE FAT -- OR LENTILS YOU KNOW THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS OF SANTA MONICA. AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST BE ABLE TO GET GET YOURSELF A LITTLE FOOD NO QUAL KALE CUTS FIVE FOOD GROUPS AS YOUR TAIL. AND IF SOMEONE THROWS A AS GOOD POSITION IN FRONT OF YOU AND SAYS THIS IS GONNA SAY WESTERN CIVILIZATION AS YOU KNOW IT. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S PAYING FOR IT HALF THE TIME THEY KNOW THEY'RE GETTING FIVE BUCKS A SIGNATURE. AND SO THEY'RE GONNA DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET YOU TO SIGN SO WE OUGHT TO HAVE A SYSTEM. WHERE THE WHERE THE VOTER HAS TO BUILD A HAS TO BE DISCLOSED INFORMATION HAS TO BE DISCLOSED TO THE THE SIGNATORY SO THAT THEY HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO IS? BEHIND THE THEIR SIGNATURE COLLECTION DRIVE. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. CURRENCY. ARE WE HAVING MORE AND MORE INITIATIVES ON THE BALLOT. AND AND AND A LOT OF OF GAMESMANSHIP THAT HAPPENS TO GETTING PEOPLE SIGNATURES. SO DID THEM THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS DISCLOSURE ISSUE SOMETHING THAT ATTRACTS FOLKS FROM ALL ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM I TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN YOU KNOW LITERALLY ALL OVER YOU YOU BOTH DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS INDEPENDENTS OVERWHELMINGLY. SUPPORTED INCREASED DISCLOSURE SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL AND I HAVE TRAVELING HERE WITH ME IS PRESENT EXACTED DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAN'T IT'S A MAJOR PRIORITY OF THEIRS AND NICHOLAS TYRANT WHO IS A POLICY LEGAL DIRECTOR.

AT MY PRESENT CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE WE ARE THRILLED THAT SENATOR ALLEN IS TAKEN UP THIS VERY IMPORTANT EXPANSION OF THE DISCLOSE ACT AGAIN. AS AS HAS HE SAID I THINK THAT WE ARE. WE'VE HONED IN ON A SOLUTION THAT REALLY WORKS LAST YEAR PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLY HAVING. TO REPRINT PETITIONS WHEN THE TOP FUNDER IT'S CHANGED -- THIS SOLUTION USING THE OFFICIAL TOP FUNDERS SHEET THAT ANY PETITION GATHER CAN PRINT OUT AT HOME EASILY AND LASTS FOR FOR A MONTH. I THINK ADDRESSES THOSE THOSE PROBLEMS SO -- AS HE SAID IT HAS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT -- ARE CLEAN MONEY ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN OUT IN FORCE AT AT ALL THE DIFFERENT RALLIES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RALLIES AND THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING THEY'VE ALREADY GATHERED -- OVER TEN THOUSAND SIGNATURES -- BY PAPER IN OUT IN THE FIELD OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND OVER ALSO I THINK THAT SHOWS THE THE BROAD INTEREST IN THIS AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHARMERS MEMBERS NICKELS HEAD ON WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE WE'RE PLEASE BEEN STRONG SUPPORTERS DISPOSE WELL. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LEADING STATES WHEN IT COMES TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE DISCLOSURE WE ALSO HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE LEADING STATES WHEN IT COMES TO JUST PEOPLE QUALIFYING INITIATIVES WE REALLY THINK THIS BILL HELPS TOO BECAUSE THOSE TWO WORLDS INTERSECTED WITH WILL REALLY HELP THE VOTERS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S COMING IN FRONT OF THEM.

IS AROUND TO DO WHEN I CLOSE I'D INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS AND AND I I ALSO WANT TO DIS DIED SEND A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO THE OTHER ACTIVISTS WHO'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD ON THIS. ISSUE FOR SO LONG AND IT'S THERE. IF THEIR ENERGY AND THEIR RELENTLESSNESS IN THE CONTINUING TO PUSH FOR TRANSPARENCY THAT ARE THAT THAT THAT I THINK IS HELPING TO MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY A LITTLE BIT BETTER. IN THESE WILD TIMES AND SO THANK YOU. TO THE COMMON CAUSE WITH WOMEN VOTERS AND MONEY OUT VOTERS IN AND AND CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN AND REPRESENT US ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING SO HARD ON THIS. THANK YOU SIR WELL DON' GO ANYWHERE. YES. WHAT'S RIGHT. MY FAVORITE COMMITTEE RIGHT YES OKAY. FANTASTIC. OKAY SO THIS IS ANOTHER SO EFFECT SOME OF THE FOLKS ARE STAYING HERE -- BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER REFORM BILL IN THIS RELATES TO ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH OUR DEMOCRACY THAT IS THE PROBLEM OF GERRYMANDERING -- AND THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE DONE AWAY WITH POLITICIANS DRAWING THEIR OWN DISTRICT LINES AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT THE PHENOMENON STILL EXIST -- IN MANY LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND LET LET ME JUST SAY THIS IS ITEM FOR FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH YOUR PLAY BOOKS OUT THERE -- IN ITS S. B.. ONE THIRTY NINE SO I'D LIKE TO OBVIOUSLY THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL. SIMPLY PUT THIS BILL REQUIRES THE COUNTIES WITH MORE THAN. TWO FIFTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS. TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION ENSURING A MORE FAIR. NON PARTISAN SYSTEM FOR DRAWING THE LINES OF COUNTY SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS. SO FOLKS MAY REMEMBER THAT WITH PROPER LEVIN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE CREATE THE CITIZENS REDUCTION COMMISSION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW WE HAVE INDEPENDENT -- DISTRICT LINE DRAWING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF OUR DISTRICT LINES WERE DRAWN UP. BY -- THE INDEPENDENT ADJUSTER COMMISSIONS. AND THERE'S BEEN A REAL INTERESTING TRYING TO EXPAND THIS THIS PRACTICE TO THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE HAD S. B. ELEVEN AWAIT TWENTY SIXTEEN US BEST BE. TEN EIGHTEEN BOTH MY BILLS TEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT AUTHORIZED COUNTIES -- AS CITIES SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES OTHER SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO ESTABLISH -- REGISTERED IN COMMISSIONS. AND NOW COURSE THOSE LAWS ARE PERMISSIVE IN THE JURISDICTIONS CAN CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT. THOSE REGISTERED COMMISSIONS IF THEY WANT OR OR A MAYBE THE CITIZENS CAN ALSO. PUSH FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THE BALLOT BUT UNFORTUNATELY JERRY MANNER HAS CONTINUED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU SEE THAT IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS I MEAN BY. ONE ANALYSIS I SAW RECENTLY FROM THE LEGO I REPORTED THAT -- YOU KNOW. THAT LATINOS ARE 40% OF STATE BUT ONLY 10% OF COUNTY SUPERVISORS -- BEANO OFTENTIMES YOU'LL HAVE COUNTIES WHERE -- THE COUNTY MAY BE VERY POLITICALLY DIVERSE BUT THE BOARD IS DOMINATED BY ONE POLITICAL PARTY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE ONE PARTY OR THE OTHER HAS DOMINATED THE THE THE DRAWING OF THE LINES AND WE ALL KNOW FROM OUR STUDY OF NATIONAL EXAMPLES HOW. THE EXTREMES TO WHICH MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES HAVE BEEN WILLING TO TAKE GERRYMANDERING TO MAXIMIZE PARTISAN ADVANTAGE. THE STATE LEGISLATURES ALREADY PASSED BILLS TO REQUIRE LA AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES TO ADOPT INDEPENDENT RESEARCH COMMISSIONS. AND IT'S NOW OUR STRONG SENSE THAT IS THE TIME FOR EVERY FOR THE OTHER LARGE COUNTIES TO JOIN THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN CONGRESS AND TAKE. PART IS IN AT A SELF INTERESTED POLITICAL GERRYMANDERING OUT. OF REDISTRICTING. SO I THOUGHT THAT'S AFFECTED WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT REQUIRES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED COMMISSION WILL HAVE THE FULL POWER TO DRAFT. AND ADOPT MAPS INDEPENDENT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REQUIRES THE COMMISSION MEMBERS BE POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IT PROHIBITS PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING COUNTY REDISTRICTING. IT ENSURES TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING THAT DROP MAPS THE PUBLISHED FOR SEVEN DAYS BEFORE ADOPTION AND THAT THE COMMISSION ENGAGE THE PUBLIC BY HOLDING AT LEAST THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS PRIOR TO ADOPTING ANY MAPS. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH THE CHAIR AND AND I KNOW THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND AND WE REALLY ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE YOUR YOUR CONCERNS AND AND AND INTERESTS ARE MET IN IN IN REALLY TRULY ENSURING THAT THIS IS THIS IS A TRUE FAIR AND INDEPENDENT PROCESS. AND IF THIS BILL DOES MOVE FOR TODAY I AM ONE OF THE PRISON COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WITH THE CHAIR. TO ENSURE THAT -- THAT THE GOALS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE ARE DRESSED IN AND WHATEVER FIND OUT COME. IS IN THIS BILL SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE -- SEVERAL FOLKS WHO BROKEN INTRODUCES US A NECKLACE FIRST FROM -- COME TO US. KAREN BERG NICHOLAS I DON'T WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE WE'RE VERY PROUD TO SPONSOR SP ONE THIRTY NINE TO ENSURE A FAIR AND INDEPENDENT COUNTY REDUCING PROCESS. FOR CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES. MENTORING HAS NO PLACE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AT ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. WHEN INCUMBENTS ABUSE LINE DRAWING PROCESS TO ADVANCE OUR OWN PERSONAL AND POLITICAL SELF INTEREST? IT HARMS PUBLIC TRUST IN THE FAIRNESS OF OUR PROCESS. UNDERMINES THE REPRESENT OF NATURE OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND DEPRIVES THE VOTERS. OF THEIR ABILITY TO HOLD THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS WHEN IT COMES TO STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE TO ELIMINATE GERRYMANDERING. CALIFORNIA STATE CITIZEN REDUCING COMMISSION WHICH REMOVES INCUMBENCY BIAS FROM THE PROCESS IS CONSIDERED THE NATIONAL GOLD STANDARD BY MANY ACADEMICS AND REFORM ORGANIZATIONS. BAD NEWS HOWEVER IS THAT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WERE INCUMBENTS CONTINUE TO CONTROL THE PROCESS. RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY PARTISAN AND PRONE COMING GERRYMANDERING PROCESS. REGISTERING ABUSE CONTRIBUTES TO THE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF RACIAL MINORITIES IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT WHICH IS AMONG THE LEAST REPRESENTED LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA XANDER MENTIONED CORN TO TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LATEST STUDY. OF 40% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE LATINO BUT ONLY 10% OF COUNTY SUPERVISORS ARE IN FACT JUST LAST YEAR. NOW THE PHONE A SUIT AGAINST KERN COUNTY. SHOWING THAT IT HAD VIOLATED THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT TO SOME FRANCHISING THEIR LATINO COMMUNITY. BUT THAT'S NOT JUST NICELY THAN INSTANCE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS BY CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS A MINORITY DISENFRANCHISEMENT OCCURRED LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY SAN BERNADINO COUNTY INTO OUR ACCOUNT IS JUST TO NAME A FEW. REDUCING WE ALSO KNOWS USED TO ABUSE TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS JUST BASED ON THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION -- IN MANY COUNTIES A PARTY AFFILIATION OF A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS STARKLY AT ODDS WITH OTHER ELECTORATE IS VOTING. TO GIVE ONE EXAMPLE FROM YOUR COUNTY IN ORANGE COUNTY GOP CONSULTANTS ACTUALLY WENT TO EVERY SINGLE SUPERVISOR. AND TOLD THEM TO BASE THEIR REDISTRICTING ON PARTY REGISTRATION FIGURES AND WHEN THE FINAL MASTER ADOPTED. THEY WENT TO THE PRESS IN OAKLAND OPENLY SAY IT STATED THAT THEY WERE HAPPY THAT THEY'D GUARANTEE THAT QUOTE WITH THOSE LINES. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL CONTINUE TO OF ALL REPUBLICAN MEMBERS FOR THE NEXT DECADE. I WANT TO STRESS HOWEVER THE REDUCING IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. WHEN DEMOCRATS IN POWER THEY TO CONFUSE PROCESS -- GERRYMANDERING IS SIMPLY NOT LEFT FOR SAYS RIGHT IT'S ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THOSE WHO ARE IN POWER ABUSING THE PROCESS TO TRAIN SOME CELLS FROM COMPETITION. THAT'S REASON WHY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AS P. ONE THIRTY NINE IT EXTENDS A VERY SUCCESSFUL STATE MODELS IN PENRY DISTINCT TO OUR LARGEST COUNTIES IN THE STATE. IT ENTERS A FAIR TRANSPARENT PROCESS BY FAIR AND IMPARTIAL COMMISSIONERS. WINNING IN DUST -- INPUT OF REDUCING IS A FAUCET IS FIRMLY TAKEN ROOT IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN NOW'S THE TIME TO EXTEND IT TO THEIR COUNTIES FOR THOSE REASONS. WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT INTERACTION I VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO. THIS ISN'T MY OKAY HI SORRY ARCHER -- BERG MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MONICA BROWN AND I'M A SOLANO COUNTY SUPERVISOR. I STRONGLY URGE APPROVAL OF SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY NINE BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS CAN BE ABUSED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. MY STORY CONFER CONCERNS FORMER SUPERVISOR BARBER CAN DEALERS. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT BARBER RAN FOR A SEAT ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SHE LOST. IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE REDISTRICTING TOOK PLACE AND HER HOME WAS PURPOSEFULLY REMOVED FROM DISTRICT ONE THE BOUNDARY WAS MOVED AND WENT AROUND HER HOME. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO SHE RAN AGAIN IN DISTRICT ONE AFTER MOVING OUT OF HER HOUSE TO A DUPLEX ONE MILE AWAY. SHE WON THE INCUMBENT CHOSE NOT TO RUN. SHE WON AGAIN IN 962-000-2000 FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TODAY HER ORIGINAL RESIDENT IS BACK IN DISTRICT. ONE WHEN I INTRODUCED INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING DONE SOLANO COUNTY I COULD NOT GET A MAJORITY OF THE SUPERVISORS TO SUPPORT IT. THE RATIONALE WAS SUPERVISORS DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THEIR AUTHORITY. THOSE WHO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM DISTRICT LINE SHOULD NOT BE TASKED WITH DETERMINING THOSE LINES. I URGE APPROVAL OF SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. SURE I REMEMBER. UP I'M DOOR ROSE I AM DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH LEGAL MOVE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO SUPPORT AND CO SPONSOR. S. B. ONE THIRTY NINE THE LEAGUE -- WAS IN A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN BRINGING AN INDEPENDENT RIGID REDISTRICTING COMMISSION TO CALIFORNIA OUR LOCAL LEAGUES ARE A BIG PART OF THE MOVEMENT TO BRING INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING. TWO COUNTIES AND CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION THEY'RE REALLY IN THE TRENCHES TRYING TO GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT. WORKING TO MAKE SURE THE COMMISSIONERS REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. IN WHICH REDISTRICTING IS OCCURRING. WORKING TO HELP DRAW THE MAPS AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT OCCURS IS REALLY ROBUST. THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND THAT IT'S DIVERSE. SO IS. THERE IS -- BEHIND ME -- IS. THERE. ONE AND THE REASON FOR ALL OF THIS RESOURCE SO INVESTED IN THIS IS THAT WHEN A LEGISLATIVE BODY DRAWS ITS OWN LINES THERE IS NECESSARILY A TEMPTATION. TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT EITHER -- HURTS OR HELPS INCUMBENTS OR POTENTIAL MEMBERS OF OF THE BODY ITSELF. WAR TO PRESERVE POLITICAL PARTY IN IT APPLE POLITICAL POWER IN ONE POLITICAL PARTY. THESE ARE NOT ABSTRACT CONCERNS YOU'VE HEARD A FEW OF THE HORROR STORIES IN THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY WE REALLY THINK IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN THIS IS TO REQUIRE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS IN -- IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SPECIFICALLY IN LARGE COUNTIES OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATIONS -- BEFORE COUNTY SUPERVISORS STREET IS S. C. SET THAT IS A GOOD START TO SORT OF MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD -- VOTERS WANT TO KNOW. THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT PEOPLE WHO REALLY REPRESENT OUR COMMUNITY'S INTERESTS THEY WANNA KNOW. THAT ELECTIONS ARE CLEAN THAT THEY'RE FAIR AND THIS IS A BIG PART OF THAT. AS AS TO WHAT WE'RE MAJORITY MINORITY STATE AND AS NICHOLAS TESTIFIED -- THE GIVEN THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF THE STATE. IS WOEFULLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. BY FIXING THE WAY THAT WE DRAW THESE -- LOCAL LINES BUT BY TAKING THAT NEXT STEP. WE'RE GOING TO GO A LONG WAY I BELIEVE IT'S A IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A MORE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. WHICH IS REALLY THE KEY. AND SO WE HOPE THAT. YOU ILL TAKE THIS NEXT STEP WITH US AND THAT YOU WILL -- VOTE TO PASS SB ONE THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IF YOU WOULD AS WE MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO IDENTIFY YOURSELF WHERE YOU'RE FROM. IF YOU'RE PART OF AN ORGANIZATION OR REPRESENTING ORGANIZATION THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION. AND IF YOU LIKE TO ADD TO THE ELOQUENT TESTIMONY ALREADY RECEIVED FEEL FREE TO DO SO. I AM NICHOLAS GONZALEZ OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCACY THERE IS A REASON WHY CALIFORNIA IS BEING PRAISED BY ITS REFERS DISTRICTING REGULATIONS I THINK WE SHOULD EXPAND [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI AM EVAN MINTON I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA VOICES FOR PROGRESS WE GALVANIZE THE ADVOCACY OF BUSINESS LEADERS ENTREPRENEURS FULLY AT THEIR PRESENT OTHER PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS. TO UNITE TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT STRENGTH IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND INSURE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. EIGHTY ONE THIRTY NINE IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BILL FOR DEMOCRACY BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS.

SHANE MCLEOD OF SACRAMENTO PLEASE SUPPORT. THANK YOU OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE THERE LATER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT -- CENTER. CENTER THE CENTER ISLAND I I JOIN WITH ALL THOSE WHO -- APPLAUD YOU FOR DEALING WAS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR OUR CONVERSATIONS CONCERNING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE OF CONCERN YOU KNOW WANT ONE ISSUE. IS. WHILE WE WE I THINK THE MAJORITY OF US CERTAINLY SUPPORT INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CODIFY SOMETHING. THAT. THAT STILL TIES THE THE PROCESS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN STATE LAW RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FIVE FIVE SPLIT AT LEAST INITIALLY IN THE IN THE FIRST GO ROUND THE STATE INDEPENDENT. REDISTRICTING COMMISSION BETWEEN REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE THE PARTISAN DIVIDE NOW IN THE STATE. AND SO -- I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOU TO COMMITTING TO WORKING WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE SOME SORT OF PROPORTIONALITY WITH RESPECT TO THE ULTIMATE. DECISION MAKING BODY WITH RESPECT -- TO THE LINES.

ESPECIALLY ON THE I. T. COMPONENT OF THE WHOLE TRANSACTION SO HERE WE ARE -- FOUR FIVE SIX MONTHS LATER IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE LEARNED OF A DMV INTERNAL AUDIT SHOWING THAT.

BECAUSE JUST SENT TO THE END YEAH RIGHT ALL RIGHT AND YOU AND IT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THINK YES SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT MR CHART. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS ON THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE ELEVEN FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUP IN THE NATION WE WORK TO PROTECT AN ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. OUR MISSION IS TO ADVOCATE EDUCATE INVESTIGATE AND LITIGATE. TO ADVANCE THE RIGHTS DIGNITY EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CHOICES FOR ALL PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. VOTING ACCESS IS ONE OF THE MAIN PRIORITIES FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WORK SO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CAN VOTE PRIVATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY. OUR VOTING RIGHTS. UNIT. PROVIDES OUTREACH IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY WITH VOTING RIGHTS VOTING RIGHTS AND CIVIC PARTICIPATION TRAININGS. THE R. C. IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. REQUIRING ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMITTEE. AS SPECIFIED AND SUPPORTS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THE THAT THE DMV EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. YES ON THE EXPERIENCES OF DRC CONSTITUENTS. WHO ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES? THE R. C. BELIEVES THAT PRIOR DMV STAFF TRAININGS HAVE BEEN LESS THAN ADEQUATE. THE TRAINING REQUIREMENT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE RC WE BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR ALL DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND ALL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE FOR THIS BILL IMPACTS AS MANY PEOPLE POSITIVELY AS POSSIBLE -- AND WE PLEASE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR OTHERS IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE LABOR CENTER HERTZBERG. NO. SO -- I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- SO THE SO A CENTER MORE LIKE -- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMITTEE WHO WHO'S GOING TO FORM THIS COMMITTEE WHO'S GONNA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FORM THE COMMITTEE. I'M THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION MISTER CHAIR IT IS. A LITTLE VAGUE BUT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE PARTIES TOGETHER SECRETARY OF STATE THE DMV THE REGISTER VOTERS -- ARE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. TO HEAD TO WORK TOGETHER AND I I THINK THEY COULD SELL SELECT ON WHO WOULD CHAIR AND WHO WOULD GET THE AGENDA MOVING. ALL UP I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT I AM CONCERNED IF WE DON'T DEFINE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE TO ORGANIZE THIS AND ORGANIZE THE COMMITTEE THAT JUST WON'T EVER GET ORGANIZED. SO IMPRESSIVE SECTORS THEY WILL DO IT -- BUT A SUGGESTION TO YOU IS IS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DESIGNATE A ORGANIZING ENTITY. FOR THE COMMITTEE -- IN IN TERMS OF THE THE PRODUCT WHAT WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT -- AND I REALIZE THAT YOU WANT TO PRE JUDGE THE THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS MAYBE YOU DO -- BUT WHAT WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT DO YOU EXPECTING OR HOPING FOR WELL WE WANT TO HAVE. ZERO ZERO ZERO RATE OF ERRORS BUT WE WANTED. TRAIN. BUT DO YOU WANT THE COMMITTEE WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMITTEE WILL SUGGEST LEGISLATION WHAT WHAT. WELL IF WE CAN JUST PROVIDE APPROPRIATE INTERNAL -- ONE TRAINING -- TO IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE. IT'S BEEN QUITE QUITE INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO CONSTITUENTS TALK ABOUT WHEN THEY RE WRITE THEY THEY REACH UP THEIR DMV RENEWAL AND FIND THESE FIVE QUESTIONS AND ON THE ON THE WEBSITE THEY JUST DON'T SEEM. TO INTEGRATOR CONNECT WE GOT A LEASE START IMPROVING THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM THAT'LL ALLOWS PEOPLE. TO RENEW THEIR DMV WITHOUT HAVING THAT AWKWARD SITUATION WITH THE REGISTRATION FOR VOTING. SO I I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE COULD GET THOSE TWO AREAS CORRECTED -- THAT WOULD BE THE GOAL OF THE COMMITTEE. SO GOAL NUMBER ONE TRADING DMB EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE T THIS'LL TAKE. WHATEVER WE WANT WITH THE WITH MOTOR VOTER AND THEN GOAL NUMBER TWO IS. TO IMPROVE THE SOFTWARE. AND IF IT IF YOU WANT ME TO PUT AMENDMENTS IN THE GET THAT CLARIFIED I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. WELL. MY MY CONCERN IS I OR EXPRESS FIRST CONCERN IS THAT WE DESIGNATE SOME ENTITY OR AS THE CONVENING. AUTHORITY IF YOU WILL. AND THEN SECONDLY IS IT THAT WE PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO THAT WE DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE COMMITTEE. IN A WAY THAT THE THEY DID WITH THE THEY PRODUCE FOR US. SOMETHING THAT IS OPERATIONAL GOOD. IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ASSUME YOU WILL. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU IS IT IS THE FILM'S FORD ALL RIGHT.

AN ADVOCATE OF ESTABLISHING COMMITTEES THIS IS NOT USUALLY WHAT I DO MISTER CHAIR -- BUT AS A LEGISLATOR LOOKING TO AVOID OUR STATE RECEIVING ANOTHER BLACK EYE THIS APPEARS TO BE AN APPROPRIATE FIRST STEP.

OKAY -- BUT NEVER TO THIS IS -- YOU WANT TO START CENTER WITH FILING A NUMBER THREE SP SEVENTY TWO CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SERVICE CENTER HERTZBERG -- LAST YEAR MARKED THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA AS OF VERSION OF THE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION WAS AVAILABLE. FOR STATEWIDE ELECTIONS. LAW REQUIRES THESE VOTERS COMPLETE AFFIDAVIT OF CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AND CAST A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. PROVISIONAL BALLOTS TABULATED ONLY HALF THE REGISTRATIONS CHECKED FOR VALIDITY AGAINST THE SO SECURITY AND DMV RECORDS. THE STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE TO INSURE THE VOTER DID NOT ALREADY RECEIVE A BALLOT ELSEWHERE. IN SOME WAYS THE SYSTEM WORKED WELL FOR INSTANCE OVER FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND SAME DAY BALLOTS WERE CAST IN THE GENERAL ELECTION ALONE. THE SECRETARY OF STATE REPORTS THAT THERE WERE NO LET ME UNDERLINE THAT NO REPORT INSTANCES OF FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH. THEM ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. THE GLARING PROBLEM HOWEVER WAS THAT SAME DAY VOTER VOTING SIMPLY WASN'T OFFERED IN NEARLY ENOUGH LOCATIONS. CURRENT LAW ONLY REQUIRES THAT IT BE OFFERED THE PERMANENT OFFICES OF THE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS AND AT BOTH CENTERS IN THE COUNTIES PARTICIPATING IN THE VOTER'S CHOICE ACT. ONLY FIVE NON VOTERS CHOICE AT COUNTIES CHOSE TO OFFER SAME DAY REGISTRATION. AND VOTING AWAY FROM THEIR PERMIT OFFICES AS A RESULT. THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WERE FORCED TO WAIT HOURS LONG LINES IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE OR SIMPLY DID NOT PARTICIPATE. WHILE THERE WERE NO MORE OF THERE WILL BE NO MORE -- BOATER CHOICE -- BACK CANDIES IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S EXCUSE ME STRIKE THAT WELL THERE WILL BE MORE. THE C. A. R. VOTER CHOICE AT COUNTIES. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS WILL RESIDE IN A NON. VCA COUNTY REQUIRING ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES AND WAIT IN LONG LINES. IS UNACCEPTABLE THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE. STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AS BE SEVENTY TO REQUIRE ALL NON VC COUNTIES TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AT EVERY POLLING PLACE THERE BY THE FILLING IS TRUE. POTENTIAL THE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTIES TO CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES. WHETHER THEY WANT TO GO HI TECH WITH ELECTRONIC PULL BOOKS. INVALID ON DEMAND PRINTING SYSTEMS OR LOW TECH BY SIMPLY PROVIDING THE SAME DAY VOTER. THAN OLD FASHIONED PAPER PROVISIONAL BALLOT. BOTH WILL GET THE JOB DONE S. B. SEVENTY TWO IS SPONSORED BY THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS COMMON CAUSE ACLU AND SUPPORTED BY NUMEROUS OTHER GROUPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHEN THIS IS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE CANADIAN -- PROMISES SOME HAVE THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAST THREE YEARS CALIFORNIA'S ROLLED OUT A NUMBER OF REFORMS MEANT TO MAKE VOTING AND REGISTRATION I'M MORE ACCESSIBLE MOST NOTABLY AUTOMATIC AGE A LOT MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS WITH THE LAST WELL IN PARTICULAR THINGS HAVE REALLY PICKED UP. SPEED OVER THE LAST. LAST FOUR YEARS I THINK BUT I'M. BUT I'M HIGHLY AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION IN THE BUSH CHOICE ACT. WE AND AND BUT DESPITE THESE WERE FOR REFORMS IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE SAW A FIVE AND A HALF MILLION UNREGISTERED ELIGIBLE VOTERS. AND TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION ELIGIBLE VOTERS DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT REGISTRATION AND PARTICIPATION GAPS. CONTINUE TO EXIST IN FACT ACCORDING TO RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROJECT PARTICIPATION GAP BETWEEN LATINO VOTERS AND NON LATINO OR ASIAN VOTERS. WAS HIGHER IN TWO THOUSAND IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GENERAL ELECTION THAN IT HAS BEEN SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TEN LAST YEAR WE'RE EXCITED HAVE CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ROLLED OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME STATEWIDE IN A GENERAL ELECTION. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE COMPLAINT IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING TO CLOSE THESE PARTICIPATION GAPS. HOWEVER COUNTIES. WE'RE ONLY REQUIRED TO OFFER CD ARE AT THEIR MAIN OFFICE WITH THE OPTION OF OF OFFERING ADDITIONAL SITES AND AS WE HEARD. I'M ONLYFIVE COUNTIES ULTIMATELY OFFERED MORE THAN A SINGLE SITE ON ELECTION DAY DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON LOS ANGELES COUNTY JUST A CURIOSITY BECAUSE IT WAS A TWO HOUR DRIVE I INTRODUCED A SAME DAY REGISTRATION BILL TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND THE GOVERNOR THE TIME WAS WORRIED THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN MINNESOTA THAT YOU'D HAVE SIX ELECTIONS ON THE SAME DATE OF WILD OUTCOMES AND SO WE COMPROMISED FIFTEEN DAYS. WHICH RESULT IN SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE VOTING IN THE NEXT LOS ANGELES CITY ELECTION. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WITH RESPECT TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY JUST CURIOUS IF YOU GOT DROPPED IN NORWALK TO VOTE ON THE SAME DAY. THAT UNDER THE FEAR BILL DID YOU DID YOU DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE VOTE COUNT WAS THERE TO SCARE THE FED ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND CONDITIONAL BUTTER AT MANY BOATS AND WELL JUST PUT IN PERSPECTIVE. SACRAMENTO HAD. YOU KNOW. I THINK CLOSE -- TO TEN THOUSAND CONDITIONAL REGISTRATION BALLOTS CAST HERE WHERE CD R. WAS WIDELY AVAILABLE. WE HAVE A LOT FEWER VOTERS IN LOS ANGELES I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S OBVIOUSLY I KNOW BUT I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO WHERE IF YOU OFFER MORE SITES WITH MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE A REGISTRAR OF VOTERS TOLD US IN TESTIMONY IN VARIOUS HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. HE COULDN'T GET IT DONE BUT YOU FOR OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN I MEAN I I WAS THAT I DON'T CARE GET A NEW JOB. TONS OF THE MORE IMPORTANT VOTING BUT THIS IS GREAT I LOVE IT. YEAH I MEAN AND SO. ANYTHING AS AT THE CENTER EXPLAINABLE PART OF WHY I THINK WE THINK. ALL COUNTIES CAN'T GET THIS DONE IS THAT THEY HAVE THIS LOW TECH OPTION OF OFFERING A PROVISIONAL BALLOT -- FOR THE TYPE OF THE TYPE ABOUT THAT'S OFFERED AT EVERY POLLING SITE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THESE HIGHER TECH SOLUTIONS OF THE POLL BOOKS WERE. BAD ON ON DEMAND IF THEY HAVE THAT THAT'S FANTASTIC AND THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO USE IT. ON THE COST OF ALSO DIRECT VOTERS TO THE CORRECT PULLING SIDE IF. I'M. GIVE THAT WATER THAT OPTION BUT IF THE VOTER. FIRST ABOUT THEIR THEY CAN VOTE AT AT THE SITE WHERE THEY ARE JUST LIKE. ANY REGISTERED VOTER CAN YOU CAN SHOP AT AT THE POLLING SIDE OF YOUR CHOICE AND IF YOU CAN. IF YOU WANT ME ONE TWO THREE AWESOME PROVISIONALLY DATA. THAT INTERRELATE. IN THE COUNTIES WHERE WE HAD MORE LIKE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THERE WERE CERTAIN COUNTIES IN SP. FOR FARMER FOR FOUR FIFTY YEAH THAT WE DO WITH WHAT I DO WITH BEN ALLEN THAT WE DID WE HAD VOTES CENTERS JUST A CURIOSITY GEMINI IN A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.% THE SAME DAY REGISTRATION VOTERS VOTERS ALLOWED TEN DAYS VOTING WHICH IS A BIG DEAL IN THE THE POINT IS CERTAINLY REMOVE EVERY BARRIER HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO IN A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO ND COUNTIES THAT ADOPTED BOTH. WE'RE A PUT UP TO DEFEAT THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT ALL ALL OF THEM HELD HIGHER CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION IS OAKS CONDITION MOTOR CHECHEN WAS REQUIRED ALL OF THE VOTES ENTERS. INTO WHAT WE SAW THERE WHERE THEY HAD MUCH HIGHER RATE OF USAGE. I'M WHEN YOU'RE OFFERED EVERYWHERE. IN THE VOTERS WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIGHER RATES I'M [inaudible] I SO WE THINK THERE'S SOME THE MAN JUST ONE OR THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PUT IT WE WE RECENTLY GOT SOME DATA FROM. I'M ACTUALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS ELECTIONS OFFICIALS SHARED SOME DATA WITH US. IT SHOWED THAT THERE WERE FIFTY THOUSAND VOTERS. I'M IN NOVEMBER WHO -- SHOWED UP AT A POLLING SITE THEY WERE THEY VOTED PROVISIONALLY AND THEIR VOTES WEREN'T COUNTED BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T REGISTERED TO VOTE UNDER THIS BILL WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COUNT THOSE VOTES. I'M I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S BEEN SOME AND CONCERNS RAISED OVER WELL. WE'RE GOING TO VOTERS WHO -- IF THEY'RE NOT AT THE CRACK PULLING SITE UNDER THIS UNDER THIS METHOD OF GIVING THEM THE BALLOT. AVAILABLE AT THAT AT THAT POLLING SITE THEY WOULD HAVE. I'M. THEY WOULD NECESSARILY GET TO VOTE ON EVERY ELECTION. AND SINCE THERE'D BE SOME DOWN BALLOT RACES AND AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT ON THE OTHER I WOULD EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT THERE THERE IS THERE WAS NO FRAUD THE SECTOR EXCEEDS -- OFFICE FOUND. NO REPORTED INSTANCE OF FRAUD AND BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM OF C. B. R. IS PROTECTIONS. EVERY VOTER CAST A PROVISIONAL BALLOT -- UNDER THE SECRETARY STATE REGULATIONS THEY CAN ELECTIONS OFFICIALS HAVE TO PROCESS THE REGISTRATION FIRST MATRIX PROCESSES SUCCESSFULLY AND THEN VEER VERIFY THAT THE VOTER HASN'T VOTED IN ANY OTHER COUNTY WE HAVE A STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THIS NOW. AND SO WE HAVE BUILT IN PROTECTIONS IN TRYING TO POSSESS IT IS. SENATOR UMBERG I WOULD BE SO HONORED IF YOU'D LET ME JOIN YOUR BILL IS AS A CO AUTHORS WHATEVER WE CHOOSE I'D LIKE -- TO TO JOIN IN ON THIS EVER IT'S GREAT TAKE THE REVISED. SO. AND WE'LL ADJOURN THIS MEETING -- GONE THERE IS A NEIGHBOR EVA VIRGIN I THANK YOU OKAY QUESTION OTHER WITNESSES. YES. FIRST OFF THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS OSCAR COPELAND I'M A FOURTH YEAR SENIOR IDC BERKELEY. AND SETTING POLITICAL SCIENCE AND CAMPING COORDINATOR FOR CALPERS NEW VOTERS PROJECT -- I BELIEVE THAT VOTING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT PROVE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND BELIEVE THAT'S GREAT THERE'S GREAT POWER THAT COMES WITH BEING INFORMED AND EDUCATED VOTER. I'M THE NEW VOTERS PROJECT IS A CAMPAIGN THAT WORKS ON RAISING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT ON OUR CAMPUSES AND COMMUNITIES AROUND US BY REGISTERING NEW VOTERS RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING. AND PROVIDING TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR THOSE THAT NEED IT -- TO BECOME MORE EDUCATED AND INFORMED VOTERS DURING THE LAST MID TERM ELECTIONS WE WERE TO REGISTER OVER SIX THOUSAND NEW STUDENT VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND MADE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND GET OUT THE VOTE EFFORTS LEADING UP TO THE MID TERM ELECTION. THESE ARE SOME EXCITING SUCCESSES FOR SURE BUT THERE ARE MANY VERY BARRIERS IN PLACE FOR MANY YOUNG PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR ELECTION -- THERE PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE REGISTRATION DEADLINES AS THEIR JUGGLING OTHER PRIORITIES IN LIFE SUCH AS SCHOOL. FAMILY I'M WORKING JOBS -- DURING THE MID TERM ELECTIONS ARE MANY STUDENTS THAT CAME UP TO US AND TOLD US THAT THEY MISSED THE DEADLINE TO REGISTER -- AND SPLITS THE WANTED TO CAST THEIR VOTE THE ONLY UP. A CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION SITE IN ALAMEDA COUNTIES IN OAKLYN WHICH CAN BE A TWENTY MINUTE DRIVE FOR STUDENTS -- MANY STUDENTS DON'T HAVE CARS ON CAMPUS SO ON THIS IS REALLY A BARRIER KEEPING STUDENTS FROM CASTING THEIR VOTE ON ELECTION DAY -- STUDENTS AT UCLA I ACTUALLY HAD TO TRAVEL TO OUR NEARLY TWO HOURS TO GET TO THE CLOSEST CONDITIONAL LETTER TO READ VOTER REGISTRATION SITE. I'M ONLY CONDITION ONLY SITUATION SITE DISCOUNTING. BY THE WAY A LITTLE OF THAT HISTORY. NO NO. NO. WE CERTAINLY NEED EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY AND KNOW THAT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF POLLING PLACES THAT OFFER SAME AY VOTER REGISTRATION WOULD REMOVE MANY OF THE BARRIERS THAT FACE VOTERS TODAY. SB SEVENTY TWO PASSING WOULD PROVIDETHE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY POTENTIAL VOTER HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. THIS WOULD EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND REINVIGORATE OUR DEMOCRACY THAT WORKS BEST WHEN EVERY PERSON IS ABLE TO HAVE A VOICE IN IT. I AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY STUDENT LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SIGNED ON TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND FULLY SUPPORT ON THE BILL THOMAS. THANK YOU HEATHER WITH DECISION SUPPORT. YOUR ROSE THE WORD VOTERS CALIFORNIA WE ARE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL AND I ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT DUE TO A RECENT COURT SETTLEMENT. THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE CALIFORNIA REGISTRARS TO PURGE INACTIVE VOTERS FROM THE ROLLS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FAIL SAFE BECAUSE AN INACTIVE VOTER WHO HAS BEEN PURGE WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW UP AT THEIR POLLING PLACE. AND TO REGISTER AND VOTE AT THE SAME TIME SO E DO NOT END UP LOSING THOSE FOLKS VOTES. THANK YOU SO VERY. MUCH. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. BECAUSE I DON WITH CALIFORNIA COMING BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DON'T THINK REGISTRATION SHOULD BE A BARRIER TO VOTING WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASY ACCESSIBLE AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. NICHOLAS GONZALEZ FOR THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY SUPPORT. THANK YOU OPPOSITION. WHO WANTS TO LEAVE THE UP YOU CAN SET UP HERE? HI MY NAME IS CALLING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. HE'S SENDING OUT A POSITION PAPER THAT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE RECEIVED YET BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE IT. AND I'D LIKE TO READ IS REAL SHORT SO -- DIRECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA OPPOSES SP SEVENTY TWO CONVERSION CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AND PROVISIONAL BALLOTS. MUST BE SEVENTY TWO AS WELL INTENTIONED BUT AN INTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF ITS IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT HE WROTE THE ELECTION INTEGRITY IN VOTER CONFIDENCE PHILIP LEGITIMATE VOTERS WOULD BE UNDERMINED? UNLAWFUL VOTERS WOULD BE CAST. COUNTED. OF EACH PIECE A PIECE THE I. P. C. A. APPLAUDS EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS BE AFFORDED A PATH TO REGISTERING TO VOTE. AND TO VOTING AS UNIMPEDED AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER ARE EIGHT YEARS PLUS OF EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND DOCUMENTATION. REQUIRE THAT WE RECOMMEND EXTINCT EXTREME CAUTION WITH RESPECT TO THE TENANTS OF S. B.. SEVENTY TWO THOUSANDS OF INCIDENT REPORTS SIGNED UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY BY THOROUGHLY TRAINED. OBSERVERS SHOW THAT REGARDLESS OF THE QUALITY OF TRAINING SUPERVISION NETWORK SOME POLL WORKERS WILL FAIL TO ADHERE TO CORRECT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS THE HONEST ERROR ENACTED IN ADEQUATE ADEQUATE TRAINING. IN ATTENTION DURING TRAINING UNWILLINGNESS TO REVIEW OR REFER TO THE PROVIDED REFERENCE MATERIALS UNWILLINGNESS TO ADOPT NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SAYING THIS IS THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS DONE IT THIS IS I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE NOW. AND EVEN HAVING A PERSONAL AGENDA THE I. P. C. A.'S COMMUNICATION NETWORK WITH COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS. HAS BEEN HELPFUL AND WERE A RECTIFYING MANY OF THOSE IRREGULARITIES AS THEY OCCUR. THERE IS MUCH MORE PROGRESS THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELECTION INTEGRITY AND VOTER CONFIDENCE. THE CURRENT JOB OF A POLL WORKER IS DEMANDING AND EXHAUSTING EXPECTING THOUSANDS OF POLL WORKERS TO ADD TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THE PROPER REGISTRATION AND THEN PROPER PROCESSING OF NEW VOTERS. WITH CONSISTENT CORRECTNESS ESPECIALLY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIGH DEMAND AND POTENTIALLY LONG LINES OF INPATIENT INDIVIDUALS. IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. THE I. P. C. H. DOCUMENTATION SHOWS THAT MISTAKES. SUCH AS THOSE IN ENUMERATED IN PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH ARE VERY COMMON. MAKING THE JOB OF POLL WORKERS EVEN MORE COMPLEX AND EXPECTING ACCEPTABLE INTEGRITY IS NAIVE AT THE BEST. IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTION SAME DAY REGISTRATIONS CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATIONS WAS LIMITED BY LAW TO THE REGISTER'S OFFICE. AND SATELLITE OFFICES INCLUDING VOTE CENTERS NEVERTHELESS EVEN AND IN COUNTIES WHERE POLL WORKERS TRAINING WAS IMPECCABLE. THE I. P. C. A. OBSERVERS DOCUMENTED NEIGHBORHOOD PRECINCT POLL WORKERS REGISTERING VOTERS UNLAWFULLY AND ISSUING PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT THE LAW WOULD UP BY LAW WOULD NOT BE COUNTED. THUS DEPRIVING THOSE VOTERS. OF THEIR FRANCHISE. THEY HAVE BEEN PROPERLY DIRECTED IN ONE OF LITTLE LAWFUL CV ARE LOCATIONS -- HAD THEY BEEN DIRECTED TO ONE OF THE LAWFUL CVR LOCATIONS THEIR VOTE WOULD HAVE COUNTED. EVEN MORE EGREGIOUS YET IS THAT OBSERVERS DOCUMENTED NEIGHBORHOOD PRECINCT POLL WORKERS SAME DAY REGISTERING VOTERS AND ISSUING POLL BALLOTS. THOSE BALLOTS COULD NOT BE RECALLED OR CANCELED SHOULD THE REGISTRATION BE REJECTED. AN UNFORGIVABLE BALL UNFORGIVABLE BLOW TO ELECTION INTEGRITY AND TO EVERY PERSON WHO VOTED LAWFULLY. CLEARLY THE CHALLENGES OF PROPER ELECTION MANAGEMENT ARE ALREADY MONUMENTAL. LIVING CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION TO LOCAL POLLING SITES WILL GUARANTEE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS. OF VOTES WILL BE MISHANDLED. EVERY MISHANDLED VOTE DILUTES OR CANCELS OUT THE VOTE OF A LEGITIMATE VOTER. EVEN ONE OCCURRENCE IS UNACCEPTABLE. IN VOTING LOCATIONS CURRENTLY TASKED WITH CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION WORKERS ARE BETTER TRAINED AND BETTER SUPERVISED THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIALS AND BALANCE NEEDED. TO CORRECTLY AND ACCURATELY PROCESS EACH VOTER THEY SHOULD REMAIN THE ONLY LOCATIONS TO OFFER SAME DAY RED. RED SAME DAY SERVICES. IN ADDITION S. B. SEVENTY TO CREATE INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR VOTERS FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND COUNTIES WHERE ELECTRONIC PULL BOOKS. AND ALL BELT STYLES ARE ABLE TO BE CALLED UP AND ALL LOCATIONS. NEW REGISTRANTS WOULD BE PER. THUS ENABLING THEM TO ACCESS ALL CONTEST WITHIN THEIR THAT JURISDICTION. NEW REGISTRATIONS AND COUNTIES NOT YET EQUIPPED WITH POLL TECH PROPER TECHNOLOGY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH SINGLE BALLOT STYLE OFFERED BY THAT PRECINCT. IN WHICH THEY ARE REGISTERING BE AT THEIR OWN ARE NOT. THOSE VOTERS REGISTERING OUT OF PRECINCT WOULD THEN BE DISENFRANCHISED WITH RESPECT TO SOME CONTENT CONTEST NOT REFLECTED ON APPLE'S BALLOT. IN THE LATER CASE FURTHER BURDEN WOULD BE PLACED ON THE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICE DURING THE BALLOT PROCESSING. AS REDUCTION OR DUPLICATION WOULD BE NECESSARY. CURRENTLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTER REGISTRATION ARM AREA. AND EVEN WITHIN ELEVEN DAYS OF ELECTION UNREGISTERED INDIVIDUALS WITH THE DESIRE TO VOTE ARE WELL SERVED UNDER CURRENT LAW. ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA URGES A NO VOTE ON S. B.. SEVENTY TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION BRIEFLY. YEAH HOW YOU DOING JOHN SULLIVAN I'M OFTEN OFFICES. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN ON FUMES FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS NOW I FEEL I SPEAK FOR SIXTY THREE MILLION VOTERS OUT THERE THAT. HAVE BEEN DELEGITIMIZE AND HAVEN'T HAD A VOICE AND THE STATE THAT I I AM A NATIVE. TO THE CARPET CLEANING INDUSTRY FROM OAKLAND TO SACRAMETO IS AND AND IT DID IT WITH ILLEGAL ALIENS. AND I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW I I HEAR IN THIS ROOM AS OUR FORM OF DEMOCRACY AND APPARENTLY NOBODY OWNS A CONSTITUTION. ARTICLE FOUR SECTION FOR THE CONSTITUTION SAYS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A REPUBLICAN FORMER GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE. SO -- I JUST WANTED TO BE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AS WELL BECAUSE THIS IS JUST GONNA FURTHER. DELEGITIMIZE THE AMERICAN VOTER THE CALIFORNIA VOTER IN -- I WOULD THINK WITH ALL THE STATES THAT ARE SPLITTING -- UNDER THE LAST. PRESIDENCY THAT -- MAYBE YOU GUYS WOULD. WAKE UP TO THIS THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY I KNOW I'M JUST ONE MAN BUT I'M GETTING BACK ON MY FEET AGAIN. AND I'M IN MY FIFTIES I LIVE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE FOR FOUR YEARS WHEN I HAD IT FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS BECAUSE I WAS LIVING ON FUMES BECAUSE YOU LIVE LANTERNS FOR AUTHOR DOING MY WORK FOR ME RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU COMING NEXT. MY NAME STAND NEAR THE CAR SOME OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. COULD I JUST SAY JUST A FEW WORDS PLEASE [inaudible] HOW? LOT OF PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO OVER THE LAST FEW ELECTIONS. SEEM TO BE GETTING VERY EXTREMELY UPSET THE SAY LEAST. HEY I'M NOT I THINK IT REALLY HIT HOME WHEN I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE THE OTHER DAY SHE PLAYS A LARGE GROUP OF CARDS WITH PEOPLE. THEY'RE MIXED BAG. SOME OF THEM DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN OR WHAT THEY ARE. ONE THING THAT SHE DID SAY THEY GOT A LONG CONVERSATION THERE IN A CARD GAME. TALKING ABOUT THE BOAT HARVESTING TALKING ABOUT KIDS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD BEING ALLOWED TO VOTE TALKING ABOUT. WASHINGTON. STATE OR WASHINGTON NOW WANTS THE HOPPED OUT OF THE ELECTION ALL TOGETHER. PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. ONE THING SHE SAID. WE ALL HAD CONSENSUS ON THEY'VE LOST FAITH IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN IT% ANYMORE. THE VOTE HARVESTING THE PEOPLE THAT AC OUT MYSTERY COLLECTING VOTES FROM. ALMOST PEOPLE AND SO FORTH YOUR VOTER REGISTRATION. I HAVE LOST FAITH IN THE ELECTION PROCESS AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'VE LOST FAITH IN THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. THAT MEANS THEY'VE LOST FAITH IN THE GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO GET BACK TO BASICS. I TRULY MADE OUT FROM MY HEART. WE NEED TO GET BACK TO KNOWING WHO'S FOLDING. NOT JUST ALLOW PEOPLE TO VOTE. MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE INTERESTED IN VOTING. AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE VOTING. FOR HOW CAN WE ALLOW SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS FOR EXAMPLE. TO VOTE. AND NO WATER FORTY FOUR MAY NEVER EVEN PAID A DOLLAR IN TAXES. THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING. MAYBE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. BUT YEAH WE'RE GONNA ALLOW THEM TO VOTE DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. SO IF THE SAME TIME -- DO HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY TAXES THERE ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE. THEY HAVE A REAL CONCERN WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY. HOW CAN THEY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE? GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LOOK OUT FOR THEM WHEN THEY ALLOW CHILDREN. WHO KNOW NOTHING? TO CIRCUMVENT THEIR VOTE. WE NEED TO REALLY STRAIGHTEN US OUT AND GET BACK TO BASICS. AND NOT VOTE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS ON END BRING THIS DOWN TO ONE OR TWO OR THREE DAYS. LET'S HAVE SOME VOTER ID LET'S MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE REALLY HAVE TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT AGAIN. WE'RE LOSING OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY LOSE IN OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY HAVE FAITH THAT ANYMORE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TALK THANK YOU SIR. IN THE US OPPOSITION. HELLO I'M GWEN MYERS I LIVE IN ROSEVILLE AND I'M OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE US. OPPOSITION.

I JUST MOVED THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER STAR I JUST MIGHT TRUSTY STAFF JUST HANDED ME A NOTE SAYING. THAT JUST ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO THE SECRETARY OF STATE MAYBE IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO BY NOW CAME OUT WITH A REPORT. WITH RESPECT TO THE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELECTION AND INDICATED THAT FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATIONS IN THAT ELECTION IN TOTALITY AS SAYING. AND 91% OF THOSE FOLKS WERE COUNTED AS AFTER THEY WERE VERIFIED TO BE COUNTED SO IS THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT READ THAT INTO THE RECORD ANYTHING FURTHER. BILL'S BEEN MOVED ENDING FURTHER CENTER AMERICA -- THE LET ME JUST URGENT I VOTE AND I'VE I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE COMMENTS I THINK ALL OF US WANT TO ENSURE THAT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE ONLY THOSE WHO ARE. CITIZENS [inaudible] VOTE. BUT THE TENSION THAT EXISTS IN TERMS OF THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR SYSTEM. EXISTS BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BASICALLY CREATE BARRIERS AND THOSE OF US WHO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE ACTUALLY DO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS THIS? INCREASES BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS I CAME. TO ELECTORAL POLITICS -- BY VIRTUE OF AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED IN ORANGE COUNTY WHERE ONE PARTY POSTED FOLKS POSING AS POLICE OFFICERS ATTEMPTED TO STOP LATINOS FROM VOTING. IT IS IT IS Y EXPERIENCE THAT. JUST AS REPORTED LAST ELECTION THAT VOTE FRAUD IS. INFINITESIMAL INFINITESIMAL IF IT EXISTS AT ALL AS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF FRAUD IN THE LAST ELECTION. SO HAVING SAID THAT I REGION. THANKS FOR THE CHECK CALL ROBLESS. MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS NUMBER. NUMBER EIGHT NIELSEN HERTZBERG CRISPER GUIDE LLEVA. STERN. STERN HI. THREE VOTES HOLD THAT ROLE OPEN THE NUMBER GIVE ANOTHER MEASURE FILE NUMBER. FIVE IS THAT THE ONE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. THANKS LEON. SO -- MY SP -- MEMBERS SP FIVE OH FIVE TO THE ROBERT PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. BY THE NUMBER FIVE THE NUMBER YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU -- CENTERS. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THE THAT THE PROCESS OF PUTTING. CANDIDATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT. IT HAS NOT BEEN REGULARISED IN IN THE SENSE THAT IS ALMOST OBJECTIVE AT THIS POINT -- SP FIVE OH FIVE SIX TO CLARIFY THE PROCESS FOR CANDIDATES TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. BALLOT CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE STATUTORY GUIDANCE FOR CANDIDATES TO ATTAIN. BALLOT ACCESS AND CONSEQUENTLY HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT CONFUSED AND LAWSUITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE FORMAL PAPERWORK. OR SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION OF THE SECTORS STATES OFFICE TO APPEAR ON CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY BALLOT I UNDERSTAND SEVEN REQUIRES IS WORKING. TO CHANGE THAT A BIT. SINCE THE SECTOR STATE DECIDES WHO ARE QUOTE RECOGNIZE CANDIDATES THROUGHOUT THE NATION OR THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA END QUOTE. ANY EXCLUDED CANDIDATE REGARDLESS OF ELIGIBILITY OR DESIRE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTY'S NOMINATION COULD CHALLENGE THEIR EXCLUSION AND COULD RESULT IN UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO THE STATE. BY REQUIRING. THE SUBMISSION FORM. CANDIDATES WOULD NEED TO SHOW THAT THERE IS SOME BASIC LEVEL OF SUPPORT AND SERIOUSNESS WHEN SEEKING THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY. CANDIDATES ARE NOT SELECTED. BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE AS QUOTE RECOGNIZE CANDIES AND QUOTE. THOSE WHO ARE NOT SELECTED STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BY GATHERING A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF SIGNATURES. AND PETITIONING TO GET ON THE BALLOT THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE SECTORS STATE ALEX PADILLA A ZERO VOTE. ANY WITNESSES IN FAVOR. KAREN MEMBERS AT TIFFANY MARK ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE ALEX TO DO WE ARE IN. SUPPORT AND SPONSOR THIS BILL TO PROVIDE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS. FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR OBTAINING BALLOT ACCESS AND WE WANT TO ENSURE VOTERS THAT THEY HAVE SERIOUS CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE DRIVER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS MY ANY OTHERS IN SPORTS. SEEING NONE DO WE HAVE ANY IN OPPOSITION. THERE WITH A SUSPECT HELLO MY NAME IS CITY WHATEVER ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR OF HIS FREEDOM PARTY OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAD TALKED -- TO THE STAFF ABOUT THIS BEFORE -- THEY WERE GONNA GET BACK TO US SO THE INFORMATION DIDN'T GET IN INTEL LATE SO. HANDED OUT -- BASICALLY. A PEACE FREEDOM PARTIES OPPOSE THE BILL THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY OF OUR CANDIDATES WOULD EVER BE ABLE. TO QUALIFY FOR THE PRIMARY AND WE THINK THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US -- NOT GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY IS FAT MATTER. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CALIFANO FOR MATCHING FUNDS WHICH IS ONE OF THE FOUR CRITERIA THAT THEY LIST OUT. FIRST OF ALL DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS CONTROL THAT PROCESS. LIBERTARIANS IN GREEN PARTIES HAVE BOTH TRIED TO GET RECEIVE MATCHING FUNDS ARE GET INTO DEBATES THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE DEBATES -- END OF IT. SO THIS WAS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT TO ALLOW. FOR PARTIES HAVE THEIR OWN DEBATES. WE DO DO THAT WE HAVE OUR DEBATES BEFORE CONVENTION BECAUSE THE CONVENTION IS WERE WE ACTUALLY DECIDE WHO ARE. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIES GONNA BE. THE PRIMARY ISSUES BASICALLY AS A BEAUTY CONTEST SO THAT OUR DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION WE'LL HAVE A GOOD IDEA. OF WHO ARE REGISTERED RANK AND FILE MEMBERS LIKE TO SEE IS OUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THE CURRENTLY THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT IS THAT -- BASED ON PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING OUR NOMINATION WE SUBMITTED A LIST AS SECRETARY OF STATE. UNTIL RECENTLY THAT LIST HAS BEEN -- SELECTED [inaudible] AND CERTIFIED. SO WE'RE KEPALA DEBATES THE AS FAR AS MATCHING FUNDS I DON'T SEE PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY. WHICH IS THE SMALLEST PART IN CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO GET -- THE MATCHING FUNDS. FROM THE FEDERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND EVEN IF WE DID WE WOULD MAKE IT BY THE DEADLINES THAT ARE SET IN CALIFORNIA -- CALIFORNIA PRIMARY SO EARLY CANDIDATES SEEKING OUR NOMINATION WILL BE ENABLED EVEN QUALIFY FOR PLACEMENT. ANOTHER PARTY IN ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY OR CAUCUS. EVEN IF THEY WERE ALLOWED TO DO SO BY THE STATE ELECTION CODES. TEN I GUESS. OF FINAL COMMENT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT THE CANDIDATES FROM OTHER STATES THIS IS A MUST BE REGISTERED. TO VOTE WITH THE PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY -- IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT. IT DOESN'T HAVE STATES THAT DON'T HAVE A REGISTRATION BY PARTY. AND SO CANDY FROM ANY OF THOSE STATES WOULD BE REGISTERED IN WHATEVER PARTY -- YOUR SECOND. IN THE CURRENT BATCH TO BE LIKE KEEPING. BERNIE SANDERS OFF THE BALLOT BECAUSE HE'S NOT REGISTERED DEMOCRAT. HE'S AN INDEPENDENT [inaudible] VERMONT. ANYWAY WERE OPPOSE THE BILL -- WE THINK IT -- DOES HARM -- SOME OF THE PARTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT GO DOWN [inaudible] GO AHEAD. I AM REGISTERED WINGER WITH BALLOT ACCESS NEWS. THERE'S SOME FLAWS IN THE BILL IT COULD EASILY BE IMPROVED. THE PART ABOUT. PRIMARY SEASON MATCHING FUNDS IS AMBIGUOUS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ONLY TWO PEOPLE EVEN. QUALIFIED FOR PRIMARY SEASON MATCHING FUNDS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF SERIOUS DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT IT. BECAUSE IT COMES WITH STRINGS. YOU CAN'T SPEND. OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY IN EACH STATE IF YOU TAKE THE MONEY. SO IT'S IT'S VIRTUALLY A DEAD LETTER [inaudible] BUT IF IT WERE [inaudible] CLARIFIED. YOU MEAN THE THE PERSON QUALIFIES IF. THEY WERE SEEN [inaudible] THE MONEY [inaudible] YOU KNOW. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ME TO TWENTY STATES. BUT THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR IT. MUCH OF THAT WOULD COVER LOTS OF CANDIDATES. AND THIS CAME UP IN OHIO IT WAS AMBIGUOUS. AND SO THE OHIO LEGISLATURE AMENDED THE LAW AND THEY SAID WELL LET ME ME WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS. THE CANDIDATE RAISED THE MONEY. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR IT. AND I WAS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL UNTIL IT WAS AMENDED THE DEBATES PROVISION WAS SUBSTANTIALLY TOUGHENED AND THAT MEANS SOMEBODY IS SERIOUS IS WILLIAM WELD FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS. IT WAS COMMUNICATED. AS CONCERNS TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. MIGHT BE EXCLUDED. IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN. TWENTY TWENTY DOESN'T WANT TO HOLD ANY PARTY SPONSORED DEBATE. AND THEY PROBABLY WON'T. AS IT WON'T WANT THEM TILL JUST AS THEY DIDN'T HOLD ANY DEBATES IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THIS PRESIDENT. GEORGE H. W. BUSH DIDN'T WANT TO DEBATE ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN HE'S RUNNING FOR REELECTION. YOU CAN QUALIFY UNDER THE DEBATES PROVISION AS AMENDED IT WAS OKAY BEFORE BEFORE. THE LIKE WILLIAM WELD IN MAYBE GOVERNOR CASEY COULD HAVE GOT TOGETHER AND HAD THEIR OWN DEBATE. THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T BE THERE BUT SO WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DEBATED BUT NOW IT HAS TO BE A PARTY SPONSORED DEBATE I WAS VERY SORRY TO SEE THAT CHANGE. SO WILLIAM WELD IF THERE'S NO REPUBLICAN SPONSORED DEBATE. AND HIS PARTY DOESN'T WANT HIM ON THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY BALLOT. ALL HE'S GOT LEFT IS THAT HE WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY THAT'S EASY. BUT YOU HAVE TO SATISFY TOO AND HE COULD ONLY SATISFY. ONE SO I FEEL THE BILL. IS A GOOD BILL. THE OLD LAW WAS TOO VAGUE BUT IT'S NOT READY TO ADVANCE YET. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. A SCENE AND BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE MEMBER. QUESTIONS [inaudible] COMMENTS CONCERNS [inaudible] NINE I'LL BRING IT BACK TO YOU I I I GUESS THE ONE THING I WOULD JUST SAY IS. I'M LOOKING AT THIS THE SIX SPECIFIC EXAMPLE ON WELD -- CANDIDATE BEING PLACED YOUR QUALIFYING TO PLACE ON A BALLAD OR CAUCUS BALLOT AT LEAST ONE OTHER STATE. IN THE CURRENT ELECTION CYCLE. SEEMS TO ALLOW THAT PATHWAY EVEN IF IT WEREN'T THROUGH A REPUBLICAN SPONSORED. MMHM DEBATE BUT MAYBE WE CAN CLARIFY I MEAN THAT AND I JUST WAS A LITTLE FEEDBACK. YEAH -- NUMBER DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN QUALIFY -- SO FOR EXAMPLE AS YOU MENTIONED. DEBATE IF YOU'RE INTO THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED DEBATE IF YOU'RE ON THE BALLOT ANOTHER STATE -- IF YOU IF HE IS YOU LOOK AT THE BILL IF YOU MEET TWO OF THE CRITERIA SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A CAMPAIGN INTERNET WEBSITE. THRESHOLD IS VERY LOW. ALSO YOU CAN QUALIFY BY IT TO DRESS THE ISSUE CONCERNED PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY -- ISN'T FREE IN PARTY CANDIDATES CAN QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. IF THEY'RE NOT SELECTED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE BY SIMPLY GATHERING. IN THE CASE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM -- PARTY SEVEN AND SIXTY EIGHT SIGNATURES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THAT CAN PROBABLY BE DONE IN SAN FRANCISCO ON A WEEKEND. OF JUST MY VIEW. DOES THAT ADDRESS YOUR YOUR QUESTION YES ABSOLUTELY SO. LIGHT CLOSE YOUR THANK YOU. IMPORTED REGISTERED.

BILL HERE TODAY WE'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN THIS STATE [inaudible] IN. TELLING YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL GETTING THEMSELVES PREPARED TO VOTE GOING THROUGH CIVICS AND TRAINING ABOUT DEMOCRACY THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A SPECTATOR SPORT BUT THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS. WE BELIEVE IT'S TOO LONG TO WAIT TIL YOUNG PEOPLE GO TO COLLEGE. ACTUALLY GIVE THEM AN EQUITY STAKE IN DEMOCRACY SO THE PRE REGISTRATION EFFORTS IN THIS STATE WHICH STARTED WITH THE BILL FROM CENTER JACKSON HAVE BEEN. QUITE SUCCESSFUL WE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS PRE REGISTER SINCE THE LAW CAME INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN HOWEVER THE BILL TODAY. TRYING TO SOLVE ONE TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH AN AGE THRESHOLD BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT A DMV FORM. WHEN YOU'RE FIFTEEN AND A HALF AND YOU CAN QUALIFY FOR A LEARNER'S PERMIT YOU FILL IT A DL? FORTY FOUR AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT TRIGGERS A PROCESS TO ACTUALLY ENTER YOU INTO THE SYSTEM THEN GET PRE REGISTERED -- BY THE STATE -- HOWEVER WHEN YOU RETURN WHEN YOU'RE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN IF YOU ACTUALLY WANTED TO GET THAT DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY FILLED OUT THAT FORM ANSWER TO MISS THE MOMENT. SO WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF PROVIDE A TECHNICAL FIX WE THINK AROUND THIS THIS PARTICULAR FORM BUT ALSO TELL -- EVERY YOU KNOW HALF THE SOPHOMORE CLASS IS NOT ABLE TO RE REGISTER TO VOTE AND HALF IS WE THINK THAT'S ARBITRARY AND YOU KNOW THE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE WE CAN GETTING GAUGE TO VOTE AND I DO THINK -- SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO VOTE MAYBE NOT SIXTEEN BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT -- THEY DO PAY TAXES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT TURNS OUT I SURE DID AS A YOUNG PERSON SO -- I'M ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS BILL AND APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER YES ALLIES [inaudible] YES.

TRYING TO ESTABLISH SOME PARITY WITH SEVERAL OTHER REFORMS WE'VE UNDERTAKEN IN THE LEGISLATURE -- STARTING A WAYS BACK WITH A BILL FROM SENATOR STEINBERG THAT ALLOWED THE LEGISLATURE. TO TAKE A LOOK AT A BALLOT INITIATIVES THAT ARE BEING QUALIFIED AND GIVE THE PROPONENTS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO REMOVE THAT MEASURE -- OR ACCEPT AMENDMENTS TO IT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THE INITIATIVE PROCESS STILL AT THE CORE OF DEMOCRACY IN THIS STATE AND IT'S STILL HELD DEAR BY MANY VOTERS BUT WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT FOLKS DON'T GET LOCKED INTO IDEAS THAT MAY HAVE SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD IDEA. AT THE TIME AND THEN WHEN MORE FACTS COME TO LIGHT IN THE PROCESS PLAYS OUT. WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES OR EVEN REMOVE THAT MEASURE ALL TOGETHER A BILL WE MOVE LAST YEAR -- WOULD HAVE A THINGS AT ELEVEN FIFTY THREE WOULD ALLOW THE REMOVAL OF INITIATIVES -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- BUT WE DIDN'T DO SURE AS TRY NOT JUST FOR INITIATIVES BUT FOR ALSO FOR REFERENDUM TO ALLOW LOCAL MEASURES TO BE WITHDRAWN AND HOPEFULLY AVOID A BIG COSTLY FIGHT -- OVER COMPORT CONFUSING BALLOT WE'VE GOT COMPETING MEASURES THAT REALLY DON'T MAKE SENSE TO VOTERS SO WE THINK IS GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE HOPEFULLY SAVE SOME COST TO TAXPAYERS AND KEEP VOTERS A LITTLE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY'RE VOTING ON MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY BRENNAN ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA WE SPONSORED. LAST YEAR'S BILL WHICH BROUGHT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCESS IN LINE WITH THE STATE PROCESS RELATIVE TO WITHDRAWING INITIATIVES -- GENIUS THAT IT WAS WE ADDED TO THE REFERENDUM AND THIS YEAR WE'RE FIXING THAT AS WELL AS APPLYING IT -- CITIES WHO NEED DIRECT AUTHORIZATION TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AS WELL SO FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORTED.
