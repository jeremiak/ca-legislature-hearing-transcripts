00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.101
NUMBER THE SPEAKERS N. F. PA'S

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:32.236

RECOGNITION PROGRAM- THAT THAT

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:38.609

HOMEOWNERS AS A GRASSROOTS

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.879

THAT. BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE AND

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.663

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.432
FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:02.066

THAT HOMEOWNERS ARE DOING THEIR

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.376
PART BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IN

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:13.944
IN MANY OF THESE WILDFIRES IS

00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:15.679
THAT- JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.248
YOUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE. DOESN'T

00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:19.016
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOUR HOME

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.785
IS GOING TO SURVIVE A WILDFIRE

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.286
IF YOUR NEIGHBOR ESPECIALLY IF

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.054
YOU LIVE IN A DENSE AREA OF YOUR

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.122

NOT BUILT OR RETROFITTED IN

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:31.762
THEIR HOME IGNITES ON FIRE IT'S

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:32.763
VERY LIKELY THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.832
SPREAD TO YOUR HOME SO. TAKING

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:37.301
TAKING A STEP BACK AWAY FROM THE

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:51.093
EARTHQUAKES. AND THAT TO

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.528
EFFECTIVELY AND MEANINGFULLY

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.764
REDUCE RISK MITIGATION IS

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:55.965
REQUIRED THROUGH BOTH THROUGH

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:58.367
STRUCTURAL ADAPTATION AS WELL AS

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:00.036
THE MANAGEMENT OF FUELS. AND THE

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:02.071
LATTER OF WHICH MUST BE DONE ON

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:04.674
A RECURRING BASIS. ALSO THIS

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.908

THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AS WE

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:11.847
KNOW WIND DRIVEN EMBERS CAN

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:12.882
TRAVEL FROM ONE PROPERTY AND

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.317
IGNITE THE NEARBY OR ADJACENT

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.252

NEIGHBORHOODS AS WE'VE SADLY

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:21.591
SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. SO THIS

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:24.093
POSES A VERY UNIQUE CHALLENGE

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:24.727
FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHICH

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.630

PERILS THAT WE INSURE. THE

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:29.865
INDUSTRY'S ONLY NEEDED TO

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:31.567
ESTABLISH A STANDARD FOCUS ON

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.769
HARD BEING A SINGLE HOME WITH

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.104
VALIDATION THAT IS A ONE TIME

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.440

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.175
MOLD REGARDING WHAT THE STANDARD

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:42.712

OPERATIONALIZE MANY OF THESE

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:14.010
REQUIREMENTS ALSO THE BIGGEST

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.578
CONCERNS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:16.879
RACES THERE'S NO INTELLECTUAL

WE FIND THAT THERE NEED TO BE A

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:38.868
BALANCE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

THOSE CONCERNS INSURERS ARE VERY

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:49.412

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.480
MODELS TO UNDERSTAND MODERN

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.883
BETTER WEATHER PHENOMENON SUCH

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.684
AS WILD FIRES. AS WE HAVE HEARD

MY FIRST SPREADING INCREASINGLY

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:55.271
POPULATED AREA US ANY

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.640
UNPREDICTED WAYS DRIVING

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:58.874
ECONOMIC LOSSES THAT HAVE

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.943
SKYROCKETED OVER THE PAST FIVE

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.813
YEARS. I EXPERIENCED THIS MYSELF

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.181
WHEN I HAD TO EVACUATE MY OWN

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:08.217

COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.220
TWENTY. SINCE YOU WON'T BE ABLE

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:13.022
TO STOP EVERY WIDE FIRE FROM

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:15.791
STARTING. AND WE CAN ALWAYS KEEP

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.893
HOMES FROM BURNING. HEALTH

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.396
INSURANCE MARKET IS NECESSARY TO

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:23.432
BALANCE RISK AND ENABLE PEOPLE

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:24.934
TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.168
UNFORTUNATELY THE CALIFORNIA

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:28.170
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET IS

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.372
NOT HEALTHY TODAY. AND IT'S NOT

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.242
HEALTHY BECAUSE WE ARE USING

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.944
THIRTY YEAR OLD TOOLS TO

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.246
UNDERSTAND A RECENT CHANGE IN

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:40.216
WEATHER PATTERNS. NEW LOSSES AND

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:44.353
RISKS ARE BRINGING THE INSURANCE

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.257
INDUSTRY TO A BREAKING POINT.

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:50.159
AND IF WE ONLY HAD A DECADES OLD

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:53.362
TOOLS TO FIGHT THIS CRISIS WOULD

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:56.198
PROBABLY LOSE. HOST WOULD BECOME

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.901
UNINSURABLE IN MANY PLACES

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.804
AROUND CALIFORNIA. MEANING THAT

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.239
AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT THREE

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.808
TRILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:09.478
VALUE WOULD BE AT RISK OF LOSING

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.814
AFFORDABLE INSURANCE AND WITH

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:15.951

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:27.916
AIRCRAFT SO NOT FROM

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:30.552
INSPECTIONS. AND WE HAVE GAINED

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:34.089
LOST DATA FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.157
HUNDRED HISTORICAL WIDE FIRED

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.660
EVENTS MOST OF THEM IN

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.762
CALIFORNIA. TO THE BEST OF MY

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:42.698
KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE LARGEST

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:43.766
WILDFIRE LOSS DATABASE IN THE

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:46.869
INDUSTRY. WE COMPLEMENTED THIS

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:51.006
LOSS DATABASE WITH DATA. WITH A

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.342
REAL FIRE SCIENCE FROM

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:55.678
INSTITUTIONS LIKE CAL FIRE AND

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.846
ID CHECKS TO MAKE INFORMED

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.049
PREDICTIONS OFWHAT WILL MAKE

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.884
MORE WHAT WILL MAKE PROPERTIES

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:06.055
MORE OR LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSS

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.990
. BY INCORPORATING SIGNS DO YOU

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.825
JUST LIKE OVERHANGING VEGETATION

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:11.493
VEGETATION MULTIPLE DEFENSIBLE

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.162
ZONES AS WE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:15.230
SPEAKERS TODAY ROOF MATERIAL

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:17.032
NEIGHBORHOOD DENSITY SMOKE A

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:19.835
PARTIAL USE OF SUPPRESSION AND

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:22.638
MANY MORE. OUR MODEL CAN

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:25.307
DETERMINE WHY FIRE RISKS. ABSENT

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:28.610
OF THE BIAS INTRODUCED BY HUMAN

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.579
ANALYSTS WERE INSPECTORS. JUST

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:34.049
REAL FIRES REAL DAMAGE AN

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:36.385
OBSERVABLE PROPERTY FEATURES. SO

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:38.554
WE BUILD A MODEL TO ASSESS RISK

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.989
ACROSS TWO DIMENSIONS THE FIRST

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:42.925
ONE IS RISK OF WILDFIRE OR AS

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.960
THE INDUSTRY CALLS THE FREQUENCY

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.729
THAT'S ORIGINAL SCORE THE

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.464
DESCRIBED THE PROBABILITY OF AN

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:51.100
ADDRESS FALLING WITHIN THE WATCH

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:53.869
PARKER METER. THE SECOND ONE IS

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.904
RISK OF PROPERTY LOSS OR

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:59.408
SEVERITY. THAT DESCRIBES THE

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:04.046
EXPECTED DAMAGE- ONCE ON ADDRESS

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.881
FALLS WITHIN A WIDE FIRE

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.916
COMMANDER AND BY THE WAY HIS

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:11.086
SECOND SCORE IS TAKING PROPERTY

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:14.089
SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS INTO

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:17.025
CONSIDERATION. SO WE PROCESS ALL

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:19.228
THE SCORES FOR EVERY HOME IN

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.396
AMERICA. IN OUR SYSTEMS

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:22.998
DELIVERED A FULLY TRANSPARENT

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.968
RESULTS IN LESS THAN ONE SECOND

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:28.604
FOR EVERY PROPERTY. I KNOW IT

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.305
WILL START UP CIRCLE STRICKEN

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.074
SNYDER INTERJECT I NEED YOU TO

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.709
START WRAPPING UP YOUR COMMENTS

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.177
YOU HAVE ABOUT THIRTY MORE

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.912
SECONDS THANK YOU. YEAH SO I'M

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:39.414
VERY HIGH LEVEL AND ABOUT EIGHTY

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:42.384
PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA HOMES OR

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.653
LOW RISK THE REMAINING HIGH RISK

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.822
PROPERTIES ARE THE ONES THAT WE

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.524
NEED TO LOOK AT MUCH MORE CLOSED

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.793
AND HERE'S WHERE I WANT TO SHOW

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:53.362
YOU AN EXAMPLE. OPERATE IN. THE

01:13:53.428 --> 01:13:55.964
HOLLYWOOD HILLS WHERE ARE THE

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:56.799
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS THE FIRE HAS

01:13:56.865 --> 01:14:00.035
HAPPENED. AND THIS IS WHERE

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:00.602
INSURERS ARE NOT. ARE VERY

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.571
RELUCTANT TO DO TO WRITE AND-

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:05.440
ADD COVERAGE. IN IF YOU ZOOM IN.

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:07.743
FURTHER AND WE LOOK AT THE

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:10.612
PROPERTY WE CAN SEE THAT WE CAN

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:11.246
PRODUCE AND ANALYSES. THAT IS

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:13.015
RESPONSIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:13.649
COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY SPECIFIC

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.584
NEEDED MEDICATION. WE CAN SEE

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:16.919
THAT THIS PROPERTY HAS AMAZING

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.221
DEFENSIBLE SPACE HAS MODERN CODE

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.923
COMPLIANT BUILDING MATERIALS.

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.458
AND IS SEATED ON FLAT LAND SO

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.260
EVEN THOUGH THE PROPERTY EXISTS

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:27.429
IN THE ZONE THAT IS HIGH. FOUR

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:29.798
FOOT WIDE VIRUS OUR MODEL CAN

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:31.967
PREDICT ARMADA CAN TRANSPARENTLY

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:36.772
LIST ALL THE REASONS WHY THIS

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:37.906
SHOW WHAT IS HOME SHOULD BE

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:40.042
INSURABLE. I LET ME JUST JUMP TO

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.443
THE FINAL COMING HERE WHY SOME

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:42.744
INSURERS ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA.

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.646
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:47.316
THE NEW RISK OF WILDFIRE. OTHERS

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:49.885
ARE PARTNERING WITH STI TO BE

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:51.486
ABLE TO EXPAND COVERAGE IN

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:53.856
CALIFORNIA. ONE OF OUR PARTNERS

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:54.923
FARMERS INSURANCE IS COMMITTED

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.825
TO WRITING ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:58.227
ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES. THAT

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:00.028
WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAVE BEEN

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.197
WRITTEN BEFORE. AS I MENTIONED

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:03.765
BEFORE IN MY OPENING STATEMENT

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:05.868
WE'RE AN INSURANCE CRISIS. IT IS

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.536
CRITICAL THAT WE DO EVERYTHING

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:10.072
POSSIBLE TO TARGET OUR WRIST

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:10.839
REDUCTION EFFORTS TO HIGH RISK

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.275
REGIONS. THIS REQUIRES USING NEW

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.277
TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS AND

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.079
RECOGNIZING EFFECTIVE ACTIONS

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.348
THAT HOME AND BUSINESS OWNERS

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.149
CAN TAKE ON THEIR OWN. OUR STATE

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:23.285
LEADERS SHOULD DO ALL THEY CAN

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.021
TO ENCOURAGE PROMOTE AND HELP.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:28.590
ALSO FUN MITIGATION ACTIONS. NOT

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.192
OUR HAND INSURANCE SHOULD DO

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.394
THEIR PART BY USING INNOVATIVE

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.429
TECHNOLOGY THAT RECOGNIZES

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:37.299
PROPERTY DETAILS KNOWN TO REDUCE

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.401
RISK OF LOSS. AND INCORPORATE

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.436
THIS LEAK DETAILS IN THE

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.472
UNDERWRITING AND RATING PLANS.

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:45.540
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:46.975
TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.311
YOUR TIME THANK YOU MR TOP TOP

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.246

FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:54.950
INCREDIBLE PRESENTATION- YOU

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:57.052
KNOW THE VISUALS ARE VERY

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.053
COMPELLING- WE WILL NOW TURN IT

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.188
OVER TO OUR NEXT GUEST JACK

PRESIDENT OF LINDSAY. FIRE SENSE

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:05.994
AND WE ARE. RUNNING OUT OF TIME

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.629
SO I'M GOING TO ASK THE

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:08.597
PRESENTERS TO KEEP A VERY

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:12.000
CONCISE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN-

OF THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.109
STAFF I APPRECIATE IN WRITING

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:21.710
HERE TODAY TO TALK MY NAME IS

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:24.012
JACK ARE CALLED MUSIC IN A VICE

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.280
PRESIDENT WHEN THE FIRE SOUNDS.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.349
OUR COMPANIES BASED IN AS YOU

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.284
SAW A PART OF BUT NOT IN CHURCH

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:30.686
DISTRICT. I'D LIKE TO OPEN BY

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.820
SAYING THAT THE FIREBIRD

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:32.521
TECHNOLOGY MINUTES TALK ABOUT

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:33.822
HERE WITH THE SAME BATTING

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:34.690
CREDIBLE GROUP ENGINEERS AND

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.591
SCIENTISTS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.393
ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY.

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.262
DEPLOYMENT VIA T. DEVICES AND

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.763
WELFARE DETECTION AND A VERY

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:47.336
EXCITING PROJECT LIKE I. I GO BY

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.104
THE END OF THIS YOU'LL YOU'LL

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:50.672
FREE. SO- WHY DO WE- THIS- THIS

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:53.408
NEW TECHNOLOGY- WHILE WORKING AT

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:54.810
THE WORST FIRES IN WORST

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.745
WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA WE LOOK

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:58.747
TO CAL FIRE MAINTAINS LISTS OF

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.816
THE LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:02.851
DEADLIEST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.853
YOU CAN SEE THE ALMOST 25% OF

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.822
THESE WILDFIRES WERE CAUSED BY

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:08.757
POWER LINES. THIS IS CONSISTENT

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.225
WITH RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.861
WILDFIRES TURN POWER LINES TEND

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:14.796
TO BECOME ABOUT TEN TIMES LARGER

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.431
WHEN WILDFIRES STARTED BY OTHER

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:18.633
PRODUCTS THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.068
THE TYPE OF WINDOW ON JUST THE

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.304
CAUSE POWER LINE FALLS WERE ALSO

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:25.874
EXTREMELY. EFFECTIVE SPREADING A

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.542
MISSILE FIRE. THIS UNIQUE

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:28.143
SITUATION CALLS FOR DEFENSIVE

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.045
FIRE DETECTION WHICH CAN DETECT

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:31.613
A WILDFIRE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.582
AFTER IGNITION. NO MATTER WHAT

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:36.251
TIME OF DAY. SUCH RAPID

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:36.952
DETECTION CAN REDUCE THE

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.687
RESPONSE TIME ENSURING THAT

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.455
FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES PROVIDED

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:43.892
THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE FIRE SO

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:46.895
HOW IS THIS DONE TODAY. THERE

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.363
ARE SEVERAL EXISTING WILDFIRE

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.665
DETECTION SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS

01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:51.833
IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.169
AROUND THE WORLD HOWEVER MOST OF

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:55.804
THESE ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:57.839
LOOK OVER EXPANSIVE AREAS AND

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.908
STOP WILDFIRES FROM A DISTANCE

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:01.576
MOST COMMONLY BY IDENTIFYING

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.478
SMOKE. WHICH MAY LIMIT THE

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.480
ABILITY FOR RAPID DETECTION

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:08.784
QUALIFIERS SMALL. IN COMPARISON

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:09.918
THE FIREBIRDS SYSTEM WAS

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:11.853
DESIGNED TO BE PLACED ALONG HIGH

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.722
RISK BOUNDARIES AND THEN TO

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:15.891
DETECT AND REPORT A VERY SMALL

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:18.660
WILDFIRES WHICH HER IMMEDIATELY

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:21.363
ADJACENT TO THAT SOUND. AS NOTED

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.731
UTILITY POWER LINES ARE A

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.699
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT HIGH RISK

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.201
I DON'T REDUCE THEIR RECRUITMENT

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:30.806
SOURCE OFTEN SEVERE WILDFIRES.

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.875
WITH THE FARMER SYSTEM HAS TWO

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.977
PRIMARY FUNCTIONS FIRST THE TECH

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:38.146
WORLD FIGHTERS. SENSORS WITHIN

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.515
EACH- FIREBIRD UNIT CAN DETECT

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:42.751
WILDFIRES ACROSS AN ALMOST

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.186
THOUSAND FOOT RADIUS RESULTING

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.254
IN ABOUT A SIXTY A PROTECTION

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:48.657
ZONE. AND WILDFIRES AS SMALL AS

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:50.225
FIVE BY FIVE FEET IN THE

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.294
DETECTED AS FAR OUT AS TWO

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.595
HUNDRED FEET AND EVEN SMALLER
