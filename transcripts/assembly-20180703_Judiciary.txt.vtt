ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY TODAY IS TUESDAY JULY THIRD. WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM. WE HAVE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE WITH MEMBERS COMING AND GOING. BECAUSE WEDNESDAY COMMITTEES ARE. ALSO MEETING TODAY SO I KNOW MEMBERS HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES TO BE. AND NORMALLY I WOULDN'T WANT TO START WITHOUT [inaudible] POLICE REPUBLICAN BUT WE'VE GOT A LONG AGENDA. AND NOBODY'S HERE YET SO WE'RE GOING TO START. AND WE WILL START WITH SENATOR HILL WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN SP. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HAD AND GOOD MORNING. GEN MEMBERS S. B.. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WILL HELP STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES ATTEND SCHOOL. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT WORKS FOR SOME OF THE STUDENTS IS MEDICAL CANNABIS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEM IN NON SMOKING. AND NON VAPING FORMS MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE IT DOSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES DURING SCHOOL HOURS CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS. THE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS AND TAKEN OFF CAMPUS IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINE. THIS IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING INFECTED SOME CASES THEY HAVE TO BE ONE THOUSAND FEET AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR A CHARTER SCHOOL. CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE. DISTRICTS IN COUNTIES THAT OPT IN CAN OPT OUT FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN REQUIRES THE STUDENT TO BE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION. TYPICALLY THE MEDICINE IS ADMINISTERED AS OIL CAPSULES TEACHERS LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT A PARENT MUST GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THEIR CHILD'S MEDICAL CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP ON FILE. SIGN IN WHEN THEY COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER THAT ADMIT MEDICINE. NOT DISRUPT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE ALL CANNABIS FROM SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER ADMINISTRATION. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO LEGALLY ADMINISTER ANY PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG INCLUDING OPIATE OPIOIDS THAT A CHILD HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED. IN MANY CASES THOSE OAKLEY OPIOIDS ARE KEPT ON CAMPUS UP ON THE SCHOOL AND ADMINISTERED BY APES BY SCHOOL PERSONNEL. BUT THERE ARE MEDICAL CONDITIONS PHARMACEUTICALS CAN'T FIX AND THEY OFTEN HAVE DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS MEDICAL CANNABIS HELPS FILL SOME OF THESE GAPS IN LESSEN THE THESE CHALLENGING SIDE EFFECTS PARENTS ACROSS THE NATION. HAVE HAD SUCCESS TREATING THEIR CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS WHEN NO PHARMACEUTICAL WOULD WORK. WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE DELAWARE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ALL PASSED LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES IN JUST A FEW WEEKS ILLINOIS. WILL BECOME THE SEVENTH ST TO DO THIS. I DO HAVE SOME -- WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU SENATOR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING SENATORS MY NAME IS CORINA GARCIA AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT JUDGES ACT S. B.. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN MY SON GIOVANNI JO JO HUMANNESS HAS USE CANNABIS IN THE FORMA TINCTURES CBD. AND TEACH THE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. HE HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH EPILEPSY SINCE THE AGE OF THREE MONTHS OLD. HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LENNOX CUSTO SYNDROME IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN THIS KIND OF EPILEPSY IS VERY HARD TO CONTROL JUDGE WITH MEDICATED WITH HIGH DOSES OF PHARMACEUTICALS. THAT TOOK THE ABILITY TO HOLD HIS HEAD. UP. AND PARTICIPATE WITH HIS PEERS AT SCHOOL HE WAS ALSO FITTED WITH A DEVICE CALLED THE VAGUS NERVE STIMULATOR ALL WITH NO SUCCESS. I WAS WATCHING MASON DIE RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. I BEGAN RESEARCHING CANNABIS AND THE EFFECTS OF IT TO TREAT EPILEPSY. AND CHOSE TO TRIED AS OUR LAST RESORT. FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED CBT AND SEEM VERY HOPEFUL. THEY BUY THE A ACM EMERGE FROM ITS MEDICATED STAY IN STARTING GAUGING AGAIN. SEATED SEIZURES WERE DECREASED IMMEDIATELY I SUPPORT THIS BILL DUE TO THE FACT THAT JUDGE NEEDS. A DOSE AT SCHOOL TWELVE PM EVERYDAY. I FEEL CANNABIS SHOULD BE TREATED AS EVERY OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ON CAMPUS. IT IS NOT FAIR THAT THIS MEDICINE OF STE HAS SAVED MY SON'S LIFE AND IT NOT BE GIVEN THE SAME TREATMENT AND ABILITY AS OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL FROM SCHOOL CAMPUS. THERE IS SOMETHING SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE ABOUT THAT. IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NO ONE HAS DIED FROM CANNABIS IT IS THE ONLY MEDICINE THAT CAN TREAT SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ON SUCH A WIDE SPECTRUM FROM EPILEPSY TO ARTHRITIS. THE CANCER TO PARKINSON'S TO ADHD AND DEPRESSION. IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REGENERATE BRAIN CELLS THIS I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS BILL BECOMING LAW MY SON'S LIFE AND SO MANY OTHER CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. I ASK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART TO GIVE A YES VOTE TODAY. AND BE THE VOICE MY SON AND SO MANY OTHERS NEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND COMPASSION. THAT'S WITH US. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. MY NAME IS JENNIFER CONVENTION. I'M A WIFE AND A MOM TO A BEAUTIFUL FIVE YEAR OLD BOY NAMED ZACHARY OR IS THE AS WE CALL HIM. IN A BROAD PICTURE BECAUSE I'M A MOM I HAVE TO SHOW OFF MY SON. WE HAVE PICTURES OF JOE DOE HERE AS WELL. I'M ALSO AN INTENSIVE CARE NURSE THAT REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER IN SAN JOSE. OUR ONLY SON ZACHARY WAS BORN IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AT FIVE MONTHS HE STARTED HAVING SEIZURES AND WAS DIAGNOSEDWITH INFANTILE SPASMS IN LIFE FOR US STOPPED. WE ALSO TRIED EVERYTHING OVER TWELVE MEDICATIONS THE KETOGENIC DIET WE SAW SPECIALIST AT LUCILLE PACKARD TALKED ABOUT BRAIN SURGERY WHICH HE DID NOT QUALIFY. FOR AND EVEN GIVEN MEDICATION THAT WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE BLINDNESS ALL OF THIS TO STOP HIS SEIZURES. NOTHING WORKED FOR US IN ON A NEXUS SEVEN MEDICATIONS HE STILL WAS HAVING FORTY TO SIXTY SEIZURES AND SPOUSAL CLUSTERS. EACH LASTING UPWARDS OF TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTES EACH. OVERTIME IS TEACHERS CHANGING HE BEGAN HAVING FULL BODY SEIZURES WHERE HE WOULD STOP BREATHING. THE DOCTORS TOLD US OUR SON WOULD NOT LIVE VERY LONG TO TREASURE THE TIME THAT WE HAVE LEFT. WE WERE GIVEN INFORMATION ON NURSING HOMES FOR OUR SON. MY HUSBAND CALLED SPECIAL CALLED LEAVE WARS AND ASKED IF WE COULD TRY CANNABIS AND I WAS COMPLETELY AGAINST IT AND THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY. AS A NURSE I REQUIRE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE RESEARCH IN FACT SOME OF CANNABIS I JUST DIDN'T FEEL THAT THAT WAS THERE BUT I WAS ON EDUCATED. WHEN YOU'RE LEFT WITH A SON WHO SEIZING IN YOUR STARING DEATH IN THE FACE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE WILLING TO TAKE A RISK? SO WE STARTED CANNABIS A CALL GENE STE USE IN -- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HIS TEACHERS COMPLETELY STOPPED. WITHIN A MONTH HE LOOKED AT US FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR. OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS EVEN ABLE TO COME OFF OF FIVE MEDICATIONS THE CHILD TO THE DOCTORS TOLD US WOULD NEVER WALK OR TALK IS DOING ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND STARTING KINDERGARTEN IN THE FALL. HE'S INTERACTING WITH HIS PEERS AND HE'S DRIVING. AT MY EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES NOW MY SON I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND WHAT CANNABIS CAN DO. THE IS FORCED TO BE REMOVED A THOUSAND FEET OFF CAMPUS AND I FEEL WE'RE BEING ASKED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS MEDICAL NEEDS AND HAS EDUCATION AND I'M ASKING YOU TO CHANGE THAT FOR US TODAY. PLEASE VOTE YES I MIGHT REALLY DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT TIME FOR THE OTHER STUDENTS OR MY SON AND I FEEL THAT THE MEDICATION THAT TO SAVE HIS LIFE AND IT'S GIVEN ME ABILITY TO BE PRESIDENT THE CLASSROOM SHOULD BE GIVEN. IN SCHOOL [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE. SO IN SUPPORT IF YOU GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR GOOD MORNING. KIDDING MADE ON BEHALF OF WE DROP CANNABIS DELIVERY IN THE LONG BEACH COLLECTORS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THINKING. MARIN BANALITY MEDICAID AS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THINKING. LUIS RADIUS O. LIKE I KNOW QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE UP INTO CANADA DON'T SYSTEM SO AND THERE WERE A LOT OF IT HELPS I'M I'M IN FAVOR OF IT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GINA BELLA. WE THE PEOPLE PRICING I'M IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'VE NURSING BACKGROUND ALLIANCE SUPPORT. OF HIS BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT SAY NONE IS THEIR OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTION COMMENTS SO MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER AND THEN MISTER KALRA [inaudible] SO. I AM INTERESTED IN THIS AND IN THESE TWO CASES THINK IT'S COMPELLING I THINK I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. BECAUSE IT APPEARS -- THAT THAT I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW A PRESCRIPTION FOR CANNABIS COMES ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN LIKE AT AN ISSUE FOR ME IN GENERAL A PRESCRIPTION FOR CANNABIS COMES ABOUT BECAUSE WE WANT TO TREAT IT LIKE EVERY OTHER DRUG BUT IT'S NOT PRESCRIBED LIKE EVERY OTHER TRACK. AND IT APPEARED FROM I MEAN JUST VERY QUICK RESEARCH I DID. YESTERDAY THAT -- THAT THERE'S NO INVOLVEMENT NECESSARY [inaudible] OR THE ATTRITION A CHILDREN'S DOCTOR WITH THAT CANNABIS CARD SO I I JUST WONDERED A LITTLE BIT MORE ON HOW YOU DID IT THE DECISIONS ON DOES SEEM. AND WHAT IT'S BEING USED FOR BECAUSE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WAY OF AN EXTREME CASE IN THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS I GET THAT -- I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE MIGHT -- LOOK AT CANNABIS AS IT AS A LOT OF PEOPLE DO AS A NATURAL REMEDY FOR OTHER THINGS THAT MAY BE A PEDIATRICIAN WOULD SUGGEST THAT A MORE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FOR CERTAIN REASONS WITH DOSAGES THAT A PRIEST. DESCRIBED -- MAKE MORE SENSE AND WHAT KIND OF OPENING UP. A PANDORA'S BOX SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT HAS JUST WONDERING -- ON LIKE DOSAGES IN THE DECISIONS AND AND THE INVOLVEMENT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD SOME INVOLVEMENT OF THE OF THE DOCTORS BUT LIKE HOW THAT'S THAT DECISION IS MADE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NORMAL PRESCRIPTION CRACKED. YEAH RULED LOOK TIME BEFORE I GIVE YOU NEED TO TALK IN THE MICROPHONE SO THEY FOR I CAN EVEN GET A RECOMMENDATION I HAD TO GET MY PEDIATRICIAN'S APPROVAL. SO HE HAD TO GIVE ME A DOCUMENT THAT I COULD TAKE THAT KIND OF THIS DOCTOR BEFORE HE EVEN LICENSE STATUS. IN IS APPLE THAT'S NOT THE LAW RIGHT NOW DOLE JUST OUR DOC THE DOCTOR WHO GAVE THE CAMPUS CARD. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOCTOR WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TREAT A MINOR AND GIVE HIM A CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION WHO NEEDED. HIS PEDIATRICIAN ON BOARD I HAD TO HAVE IT ON A LETTERHEAD STATING THAT HIT MY PEDIATRICIAN SUPPORT MIND EVER. TO PURSUE CABINETS BUT I WOULD IT DOES SEEM BECAUSE EACH PERSON IS DIFFERENT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF TRIAL AND ERROR SO. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE STARTED ON THE LOWER SPECTRUM AND THEN TITRATED UP? SO IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE YET WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW HOW THE BODY METABOLIZES EACH PERSON IS DIFFERENT RULE IT IT METABOLIZES DIFFERENT. SO THEREFORE -- LIKE THOSE IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT FROM CHEN STOSUR YOUR DOES. AND YOU JUST TITRATE UP AS YOU GO. BU YOU'RE FOLLOWED BY YOUR PEDIATRICIAN THIS PEDIATRICIANS VERY INVOLVED WHEN THEY COME SEE HIM HE WANTS TO KNOW THE MILLIGRAM WITH. THE DOES SEEM TO TYING -- ALL OF THAT SO WITH THIS BILL REQUIRED THAT A PEDIATRICIAN AS INVOLVED IN THAT. THE TREATMENT OF A CHILD'S WE HAVE TO BE BECAUSEIN ORDER TO GET THE FORMS SIGNED ON CAMPUS THE PEDIATRICIAN HAVE LIKE THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S WHAT I WANTED IT IS NOT PART OF THE BILL. THAT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY OUTLINED IN THE BILL BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT THE THE KEY IN THE BILL IS THAT YOU HAVE A PHYSICIAN'S RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THE PRESCRIPTION FROM. A DOCTOR THAT THAT TO CALLS. FOR AND WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THEM AND WHAT MY CONCERNS IT IS IT ISSUE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MINERS THAT IT'S NOT JUST I MEAN BECAUSE THERE ARE I'M SORRY THERE'S STILL SOME DOCTORS OUT THERE THAT WOULD. WELL I TO ANYBODY AND I'M AND SO I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BUT I WAS WONDERING YOU KNOW AS FAR AS BRING IT ON SCHOOL AND AND BUT AND I KNOW IT'S RIGHT ON TO THE SCHOOL BY THE PARENT TO TAKE SHOULD IN ADMINISTERS A TO THE PATIENT TO THE CHILD. AND THEN REMOVES IT FROM THE CAMPUS UNLIKE OPIOIDS WHICH ARE ON CAMPUS AND LEFT THERE IT LIKE IN THAT STORE THAT COULD BE USED IN THESE ARE NOT THE T. H. C.. TYPE OF PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABIS THESE ARE THE CB DE TYPE WHICH HAS WRITTEN THAT'S HOW THAT'S ALLOWED UNDER THIS IN ALL ITS ALLY CB DE I WOULD REVEAL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IF IT ALSO REQUIRED THAT IT WAS -- THAT THE P. ALONG WITH CANNABIS [inaudible] WE'LL JUST. I I I NOW I READ THE LA CALIFORNIA'S MADE THAT. CLEAR IN IS YOU ARE BUT WHAT CHANGING A LOT FOR BRINGING THINGS ON CAMPUS AND I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT IT WOULD MAKE ME MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. IF THE P. EFFORT PEDIATRICIANS ARE INVOLVEMENT WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BE -- DELIVERING THIS SO IT'S NOT JUST A PARENT'S DECISION BUT IT'S A BONTA FIGHT NOT THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DISMISS AYE IT YOU KNOW THERE'S THE LAW THERE'S ONLY CERTAIN HOLD ON HOLD ON HOLD ON SHE MADE A STATEMENT THERE WAS NOT A QUESTION THERE SO. SO I WAS JUST I I DON'T KNOW. IF THIS IS THE LAST STOP ON THIS BILL IF IT COMES IT IS. I AM A WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT. AND I KNOW YOU LOVE IT WHEN I START ABSENCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT SAYS BEEN LEGAL. FOR MINORS TO SORT OF IS IT SHOULD MINISTER FROM UP. A LICENSED PHYSICIAN IN CALIFORNIA AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN YOU HAVE WHICH IS THE SAME CONCERN THAT CHEN RAISED IN HER SKEPTICISM OF THE ECHO OF AND I THINK WE ALL HAVE BEEN AYE WHICH SURPRISED AND FOR ME TO CARRY THIS BILL I WAS SHOCKED. THAT I WOULD BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE I THOUGHT FRANKLY ANYONE CAN GET UP A PRESCRIPTION OR A RECOMMENDATION FROM A DOCTOR IN THAT IT WAS. YOU KNOW USED -- TO RANDOMLY FOR RECREATION FOR ACTUAL TREATMENT OF OF OF OF THE OF A OF A MEDICAL PROBLEM BUT THAT -- I'VE LEARNED A LOT I WOULD JUST HATE A SITUATION BY WHICH AND NOT SUGGEST THAT PARENTS CAN'T PARENT THEIR CHILDREN BUT WE'VE WE'VE. MADE A LOT OF DECISIONS FOR PARENTS WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL DECISIONS -- VACCINES BEING THE MOST OBVIOUS BUT THERE ARE PARENTS WHO WHO MAY DECIDE JUST WITH A CARD THAT THEY ARE DOING. AND THE PROTOCOLS THEMSELVES AND I I WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF A PEDIATRICIAN OR A DOCTOR THAT IS WORKS WITH CHILDREN. THE SAME WAY I MEAN WE HAVE A BILL ON HEADS CANNABIS AND WE ONE INVOLVED THAT I MEAN THIS IS SERIOUS LIKE WE ONE OF ALL THE VETERINARIAN BECAUSE WE WANT. PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR THE DOCTOR THAT. THAT WORKS WITH THAT PATIENT WHETHER IT'S WHAT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE SENATORS DO IT WOULD SHIP IT RIGHT NOW THE DOCTOR -- IF A PARENT BRINGS A CHILD TO A DOCTOR AND RECEIVED THE CANNABIS IN A RECOMMENDATION -- THAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE IT'S ALREADY USED IT IN THE PROJECT TO SOLVE AND RESOLVE SOME PROBLEMS THIS BILL ONLY ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE THAT EXISTING. USE OF THAT SHE BEAT THE OIL ARE TO ENSURE AND BRING IT ON TO THE CAMPUS RATHER THAN REQUIRING THAT. PARENT TO TAKE THAT CHILD A THOUSAND FEES RIGHT FROM IT IN A WHEELCHAIR IS IN THE CASE OF THAT PHOTO. AND ADMINISTER THAT -- THAT CBD OIL THAT'S TO JOHNNY HERE IT'S NOT PSYCHOACTIVE IT'S NOT SIMILAR TO AND IT ALSO IS LOCAL CHOICE IF THAT. THE AS WE KNOW IT TO SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN CHOOSE NOT TO DO IT IF TRACK THEY DON'T WANT TO THERE'S NO MANDATE INVOLVED. CHART I HAVE ON MY QUE TENGAN. OKAY SO I I LAKE WOULD I I'M SORRY I AS THAT YOU WOULD YOU LIKE I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE VISITED LIKE THIRTY PLUS CANNABIS DOCTORS WE'RE TRYING TO GET A RECOMMENDATION. NOBODY WILL GIVE A RECOMMENDATION TO A MINOR YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN DEAR PEDIATRICIAN. BECAUSE OF THE ILLEGAL FOR MINORS TO USE CANNABIS SO YOU HAVE TO GET ANY. LIKE YOUR PHYSICIANS ONBOARD AND THERE'S ONLY VERY SPECIFIC DOCTORS WHO WILL GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S NOT LIKE AN ADULT. RE I CAN GO TO JUST LIKE YOUR POINT YOU CAN GO TO ANY. CANNABIS DOCTOR FOR ANY REASON YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE INVOLVED IF YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE'S DOCTORS WILL GIVE YOU RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S DIFFERENT FOR CHILDREN BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S NOT THE LAW THAT MIGHT BE THE PRACTICE OF MY WRONG ON THAT. MY MISREADING THE LAW ONLY CERTAIN CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION DOCTORS TREAT LIKE THEY'RE THEY DON'T ALL DIFFERENT. SENIOR CLASS YOU ARE LIKELY THOUGH TO TAINT YOUR QUESTION. TO GET A CANNABIS CARD WHICH I THINK IS YOUR ISSUE. JUST NEEDS A PHYSICIAN TO SAY SO AND BECAUSE THERE ARE MINOR APPROACH PARENTAL PERMISSION EVER. YES SO IT HE'D IT IS OPENING UP IF DOCTORS ARE TAKING AMONGST THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT ISSUING THOSE. TO MINORS WITHOUT A PEDIATRICIAN THEN. I THINK YOU HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS THERE IF NOT. THEN THE THE ISSUE RAISING IS IS. AT ADDRESSING ISSUES. AND MAYBE IT'S NOT THE PART I DON'T WANT TO PREVENT -- YOUR CHILD FROM STARTING KINDERGARTEN WITH. A NORMAL KIND OF SITUATION SO -- I I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON THIS ASPECT I WOULD JUST FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IF IT IF IT CAME WITH. THE RECOMMENDATION OF A PEDIATRICIAN -- AS WELL YOU KNOW WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU HAD I HAD TO GET THAT BEFORE I EVEN KNOW ABLE TO YEAH OF THE CANNABIS CARD FOR WHO I UNDERSTAND MY DOCTOR HAD THE SIGGRAPH HITTING A PAYER. SO IT IS NOT TIME FOR BACK AND FORTH AS A COVER ANSWER QUESTIONS. SO I THAT'S UNDERSTAND THINK THE INTERNET AND ALSO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR THAT THAT -- RIGHT NOW IF IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN ADD THIS IS A POLICY IF THEY'D LIKE IF THEY THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY AS WELL AS PART OF THEIR OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ITS GOING TO APPLY TO WHAT WE COULD HAVE. WE CAN APPLY ISSUE OF AND AS WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM THE WITNESSES IN. I WOULD SAY MOST CASES OF BEFORE OF A REGULAR PHYSICIAN WOULD RECOMMEND CANNABIS TO A MINOR HE WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE HER SHE WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE SOME. SOME SOME PRESCRIPTION OR SOME. RECOMMENDATION FROM -- THAT THE CHILD'S PEDIATRICIAN TO SEE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE STANDARD PRACTICE FROM WHICH IT IS NOT IN LAW BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE PRACTICE. THANK YOU. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISS SURE I'M I HAVE AND BY ONE OF THE FEW AREAS WHERE. I DIFFER A LITTLE BIT FROM MY COLLEAGUE ON HOW WE APPROACH THIS ISSUE -- AYE FIRST OF ALL I THINK THIS IS CONTINUES TO BE A FEDERAL FAILURE -- THAT WE HAVE TO TREAT CALABASAS. I A N. AND THE WAY THAT IT'S TREATED AND THAT'S UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND THE CURRENT ONE SO IT'S NOT A PARTISAN THING I THINK THAT. REALLY -- THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ACTED -- AND TREATED CANNABIS WAY THAT IT SHOULD TO ALLOW FOR PROPER RESEARCH ALLOW FOR PROPER USE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MEDICINE. AND THE REALITY IS THAT THIS. AS BILL WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT -- IT. THE TREATS CANNABIS STRICTER THAN PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS THAT ARE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS AND MUCH MORE SEVERE. THAN CANNABIS UP FOR CHILDREN AND LOOK YOU KNOW I HAVE I THINK IT'S BECOME WELL DOCUMENTED IN RECENT YEARS. THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF CANNABIS UPON OUR CHILDREN AND ADULTS REGARDING SEIZURES WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IN SOME CASES THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE. THAT COULD HELP -- BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY A MANY OTHER APPLICATIONS ANXIETY EIGHTY HD YOU NAME IT THAT RIGHT NOW. CHILDREN ARE BEING DRUGGED UP WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AB ROTTING ó BETTER THAN OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND AGAIN THIS IS CBD. NOT TEENAGE SEE AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED I DO HAVE A CBD BILL FOR PETS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON BECAUSE OF THEIR SUB MAKE BEEN RELIEF. OTHER THAN HEAVY NARCOTICS AND PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE. A PROBABLY EXPLORED BY THE THAT THE POSITION AND THE PARENT OF AND WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT NOW I THE THE MY AT MY HESITANCE AND THAT SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS IS THAT I I REALLY WOULD HESITATE TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT. WE HAD TREATED CANNABIS AND TERMS OF WHAT'S REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT TO THE DISTAL USE AS A STATE NOW AS MENTIONED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN YOU KNOW. LOCAL SCHOOLS TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN RULES AS THEIR CAMPUS IT SAYS GO THERE CAMPUS SAFETY I GET THAT. BUT I WOULD HESITATE AS US AS A STATE TO GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT WE'VE GONE PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHERE WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR FEDERAL ACTION AT A TIME OR RECREATIONAL HAS BEEN. LEGALIZED I THINK THAT HONING IN ON STILL GET MEDICINAL TO THOSE THAT NEED IT THAT THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TENSION RECREATIONAL OR FORGETTING THAT WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE STILL PUTTING PEOPLE NEED. A BUT WE CANNABIS NEED CB DE UP FOR AILMENTS AND I I THINK THAT I'M THIS BILL I I THINK IT IS. BUT AS IT STANDS I FULLY SUPPORT IT I THINK THAT HAVING A PARENT OR GUARDIAN COME ON TO THE CAMPUS ADMINISTER AND THEN LEAVE THE CAMPUS WITH THE CANNABIS -- IS AS RESPONSIBLE WAY AS IT COULD BE. DONE AND MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN HOW WE TREAT PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION AGAIN THAT CAN BE MUCH MORE SEVERE IN TERMS OF HOW IT IMPACTS BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY AT A A MINOR. SOMEONE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION. THANK YOU SECARA. SO SAID I THINK WHAT I THINK YOU'RE HEARING HERE IS IS A CONCERN OF MINE THAT WITH THIS BILL I THINK THIS THAT YOU'RE MOVING THIS FORWARD. BUT I ALSO WORRY WHEN WHERE WE HAVE A CULTURE OF OVER MEDICATING CHILDREN. AND WE MEDICAID CHILDREN FOR OUR BENEFIT FOR THE SCHOOL'S BENEFIT NOT FOR THE CHILD'S BENEFIT THERE'S OF TOO LONG OF HISTORY OF THAT. AND THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY FACILITATING THAT BUT TO THE POINT THAT IT BECOMES TOO EASY TO MEDICAID A CHILD FOR THE BENEFITTED SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE CHILD WHETHER IT'S CANNABIS RITALIN. YOU NAME IT. AMOUNT OF A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND THAT'S ON THE I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR RIGHT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN IN IN IN RESPONSE TO THAT I AM. ABSOLUTELY. CONVINCED THAT DIDN'T MANY OF THE ILLS AND PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SUFFERED STRUGGLE WITHIN SOCIETY IS THE RESULT OF THAT. THE ISSUE WITH WITH THE CANNABIS IN THE CBD AND BRINGING THAT ON CAMPUS UNLIKE THE OCHRE OPIOIDS THAT ARE AND OTHER DRUGS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED ON THE CAMPUS AND LEFT THERE FOR THE SCHOOL TO ADMINISTER. A PARENT HAS TO ACTUALLY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY DURING THE DAY AND COME ON TO THE CAMPUS ADMINISTER THAT IN REMOVING TO ME WHICH IS A CHALLENGE IN. AND NOT SOMETHING EASY FIRM FOR MANY PARENTS TO HAVE TO DO SO WHICH WOULD BE A STRUGGLE IN THE IN A SACRIFICE IN MANY CASES TO DO THAT IF THIS WERE. SOMETHING INVOLVED I DO ABOUT WHAT I WANNA DO IN THE INTERIM AND TO AND TO RESPOND. TO A ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THOSE FLETCHER'S A QUESTION IS TO FIND OUT WHAT THE ROOM WITH THE STANDARD OF PRACTICE IT'S AND AND TO SEE WHAT. DIDN'T WARM IS WITHIN THE IN TERMS OF MINORS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A CANNABIS DOCTOR I GUESS ROCK OF A BETTER WORD AND FROM THEIR PEDIATRICIAN IF THAT'S WHAT IS THE THE THE THE PRACTICE AND A AND UP BE HAPPY TO GET THAT INFORMATION -- AND AND BRING IT BACK WITH THE I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT IN WITH RESPECT WE ASTRONOMICAL MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU WE DON'T OF COURSE WE CAN'T TO GET UP GET AT THEM OVER TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU PRO THINK OF THE CONVERSATION. CREATED THANK YOU. RIGHT SENATOR ROTH. IT'S NEXT SO. TAKES US TO ITEM. TWELVE AND SIXTEEN S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AM SCR.

SINCE A NINETEEN ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY THREE THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION IS BEEN STUDYING TOPICS AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE AT LEAST ONCE. PER REGULAR SESSION THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION. THAT SETS OUT A CALENDAR OF TOPICS AUTHORIZED FOR STUDY BY THE COMMISSION. THIS PARTICULAR OF CONCURRENT RESOLUTION SIMPLY RENEWS THE ASSORTED TO STUDY A CALENDAR OF TOPICS AUTHORIZED IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BY ACR. ONE FORTY EIGHT WITH ONE ADDITION REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROLS INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL HAVING TO DO WITH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SO WITH THE OF AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. WE HAVE A QUORUM OF EXPECT LEAH'S FOR AN AYE VOTE. CENTER. ANY ONE WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS. ALRIGHT SEEING NONE SO DID YOU ARE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS. OKAY IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. COME UP HERE [inaudible] CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY STATEMENT. MY NAME'S RUN KELLY. I SERVED AS THE EXPERT ADVISOR IN DRAFTING THE CHAPTER OF THE EVIDENCE CODE THAT PROVIDES MEDIATION CONFIDENTIALITY IN THE STATE AND HAS. FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW. AND I WAS START BY SAYING THAT I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF SENATOR ROTH TO MEET WITH ME FOR AN HOUR LAST WEEK. AND REALLY SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING. POLICY AND PROCESS REASONS WHY I'M ASKING YOU [inaudible] TO WITH HOLD YOUR I VOTE UNLESS TWENTY THREE IS AMENDED. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BY THE VERY ABLE. CHIEF COUNSEL TALKS ABOUT THE SURPRISING AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION TO WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE SEEING IT AS A A ROUTINE. RESOLUTION TO STUDY THE SAME TOPICS AS THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN STUDYING. THERE ARE OVER A DOZEN MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE WRITTEN IN OPPOSITION UNLESS TWENTY THREE IS AMENDED INCLUDING MAJOR BAR SO CA SHINS AND MEDIATION PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE. INCLUDING MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MAIN. MEDIATION ORGANIZATION IN YOUR DISTRICT THE MENTAL GUESS CENTER WHY? THE STUDY THAT THIS SECTION. TWENTY THREE DIRECTS THE COMMISSION TO DO HAS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED. THEY'VE ALREADY FINISHED THEIR STUDY. THEY'VE ALREADY VOTED TO APPROVE THEIR FINAL RECOMMENDATION. AND THAT RECOMMENDATION WAS SO WIDELY POSE THAT NO LEGISLATOR WOULD CARRY. THE COMMISSION TOOK INPUT FOR FIVE YEARS FROM THE PUBLIC FROM ORGANIZATIONS WHO SPENT ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME FLYING AROUND THE STATE. COMMENTING. ANALYZING PROPOSALS I MYSELF ATTENDED TWENTY TWO STRAIGHT COMMISSION MEETINGS. VIRTUALLY EVERYONE IN THE FIELD AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS FOR SAYING YOU'RE TAKING THE WRONG APPROACH. THIRTY THREE ORGANIZATIONS WENT ON RECORD THIRTY TO OPPOSE THE APPROACH THE COMMISSION TOOK IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY. SECTION TWENTY THREE IS OBSOLETE AND REDUNDANT ANYWAY AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU. IF THERE IS A PROCEDURE AWAITED DO SO. CHANGE SECTION TWENTY THREE TO SAY THE SECTION DELETED. THANK YOU FOR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ANYONE SCOTT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I'D SAY NONE OF IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] ALRIGHT SENATOR PERHAPS YOU CAN. ADDRESS THAT AND ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE WELL. YOU MISTER CHERUB THAT ACTUALLY MY FRIEND WAS WAS CORRECT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FROM MY UNDERSTOOD MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE COMMISSION HAS COMPLETED ITS WORK IN STUDYING THE MEDIATION PIECE OF THE ASSIGNMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE OF PROVIDED TO IT. OF THERE IS A REPORT -- THAT IS AT LEAST IN DRAFT IF NOT. FINALIZED AND FINALIZED -- THAT IS POSTED -- I'VE MY POSITION IN THE PAST HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT -- WE'RE NOT TAKING A POSITION ON THESE ISSUES ONE WHERE THE OTHER OR A POSITION ON THIS STUDY IN THE THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMISSION REACHES. IN ANY OF ITS STUDIES WERE SIMPLY REAUTHORIZING THE COMMISSION'S PORTFOLIO IF YOU WILL -- AND THAT'S THE CASE HERE. I THOUGHT IT WAS. PERHAPS A A BAD PRECEDENT START BY DELETING ASSIGNMENTS. THAT WE HAVE IS A LEGISLATURE GIVEN THE COMMISSION FROM SUBSEQUENT RESOLUTIONS WHEN WE REAUTHORIZE ITS WORK. THE COMMISSION DOES HAVE TO FROM TIME TO TIME. PROVIDE SUPPORT -- ANSWER QUESTIONS REGARDING THE STUDIES THAT IT CONDUCTS. IT PERHAPS HAS SUCH AUTHORITY A BURIED IN THE RESOLUTION IN OTHER PLACES [inaudible] SO ON IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE. TO STRIKE AN ASSIGNMENT THAT WE PREVIOUSLY GIVEN THE COMMISSION. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SERVICE THREATS OF SUFFICIENT RESPONSUM HAPTIC AS ANSWER FURTHER QUESTIONS IF ANYONE. HAS THEM ON THE SUBJECT. DIED AND JUST WAIT AYE AYE I AGREE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT BY STRIKING ALLEVIATE IT IS DETERMINATIVE OF ANYTHING THAT THIS BODY MAY. OR MAY NOT DO IS NOT WEIGHING IN ON THE SUBJECT AND I AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE. THERE'S NO PRECEDENT FOR US STRIKING OUT A REMOVING AUTHORITY AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD BE. HAVE WOULD NEED TO DO VERY VERY CAREFULLY TO REMOVE AUTHORITY FROM THE LAW REVIEW COMMISSION. AND MISTER CHAIR I WOULD ADD TO HAVING SPENT SOMETIME WITH MR KELLY WHO'S AN EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUAL VERY BRIGHT -- CERTAINLY INFORMED ME ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING THIS ONE I WOULD NOT WANT TO TAKE A POSITION. IN THIS RESOLUTION ON THAT PARTICULAR OF SUBJECT IN THAT AND THE STUDY THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE COMMISSION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. THINK THERE'S YOU CLOSER YES SIR RESPECTFULLY HAS FOR A VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IF THEY WERE. ALRIGHT. THEN WE'LL MOVE TWO I'VE EVER TWELVE S. B.. ELEVEN TWENTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOES THE THREE THINGS IT PERTAINS TO COMMON INTERESTS TO DEVELOPMENTS. HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS CONDOMINIUMS AND LIKE IT ALLOWS RESIDENTS OF COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS TO OPT IN BY EMAIL TO RECEIVE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS. SUCH AS ANNUAL BUDGETS AND ANNUAL POLICY STATEMENTS BY EMAIL AND TO DO SO THROUGH THE USE OF EMAIL. IT ALSO CHANGES THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT PERIOD FOR PROPOSED RULE CHANGES TO TWENTY EIGHT DAYS FROM THIRTY DAYS. IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE MORE EFFECTIVE CALENDARING OF MEETINGS. FINALLY IT CREATES -- AN ACCLIMATION PROCESS FOR UNCONTESTED BOARD ELECTIONS WHERE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES DO NOT EXCEED AND IN SOME CASES ARE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES. THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS -- IN MOCK UP FORM THAT ARE A COMBINATION AMENDMENTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT WILL GIVE WOULD BE RIGHT IN CANDIDATES AN ADDITIONAL. TWENTY ONE DAY PERIOD TO SUBMIT EVIDENCE OF CANDIDACY AFTER THE CLOSE OF NOMINATIONS. AS WELL AS AMENDMENTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE COMMITTEE TO INCORPORATE RESTRICTIONS. ON CANDIDATE QUALIFICATIONS IN OTHER WORDS RESTRICT THE TYPE OF RESTRICTIONS SO TO SPEAK. THAT ASSOCIATIONS MAY PLACE ON CANDIDATES IN CANADA RECRUITMENT. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES IT AGAIN AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I RESPECTFULLY AS FOR AN AYE VOTE. SEN SO YOU'RE TAKING THOSE OF ITS ABSOLUTELY MUST CHECK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT THIGH WITNESSES SUPPORT PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TIME BRAD HATS AND SEE ALL THE GOOD AWARDS VILLAGE A COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT HAVE. TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HOMES AND OVER EIGHTEEN AT THOUSAND RESIDENTS AGE FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER WHERE THE SPONSOR OF S. B.. ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT MOST MORE MEMBERS LIVE ON MODEST FIX INCOMES. ARE THE AB AVERAGE MEDIAN INCOME IS UNDER FORTY THOUSAND IN OUR COMMUNITY. ARMS WE TRIED TO BE VERY FRUGAL AREA IN USING THEIR RESOURCES TO WRITE A VERY HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE IN A PRETTY EXPENSIVE. OUR COMMUNITY. BOMB THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT OF THOSE AFTER. WITH RESIDENT RESOURCES I THINK THE SENATOR COVERED THE FIRST. TWO PRETTY WELL -- THE EMAIL -- COMMUNICATION AS WELL AS THE CHANGE WITH THIRTY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS WILL BE VERY EFFICIENT FOR US AND WILL SAVE OUR RESIDENTS. A LOT OF MONEY. NAM THE THIRD CHANGE ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION BY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS THIS PROVISION WOULD EXTEND H. WEIGHS THE SAME ABILITY. MUNICIPALITIES SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE -- UP TO A POINT BY ACCLAMATION AND AVOID COSTLY COSTLY ELECTIONS WHEN THE OUTCOME IS IS ALREADY KNOWN. NAM FOR H. AWAY SUCH AS OURS A SINGLE ACTION. COST BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE DO THREE A YEAR AND SO. I LAST YEAR WE SPENT ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON UNCONTESTED. OUR ELECTIONS I'M SO WE'VE HEARD CONCERNED HAVE. A FOR MAYBE THAT SOMEHOW -- THE BOARD WOULD. OUR BOARDS WOULD IMPOSE -- KIND OF AND REASONABLE QUALIFICATIONS AND AND I IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT KIND OF UNFOUNDED WE HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING PEOPLE. TO TAKE ON THESE CHALLENGING VOLUNTEER PASSED THAT IN OUR COMMUNITY IT'S A FORTY HOUR WEEK JOB. AND I HAVE FORTY TWO BOARD MEMBERS SO FINDING FORTY TWO BOARD MEMBERS TO VOLUNTEER THAT KIND TIME IS QUITE DIFFICULT. AND SO -- I THINK OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE ADDED -- WHILE WE DON'T HAVE TO BE RESTRICTIONS OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE'RE DYING GET MORE BOARD MEMBERS I THINK OUR IS GOOD POLICY AND AND I APPLAUD -- THE COMEDIAN AND THE SENATOR -- FOR TAKING THAT TASK ON AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE ADDED. INCLUSION INTO THE ACCLAMATION PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND AND FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE BY THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL COME TO THE TABLE [inaudible] ARTIST YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOW AND HE TO COME BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE -- WE WARN SUPPORT AND WE SUPPORT VOTE BY ACCLAMATION UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BURDENS OF PLACES ON HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME HAVE TO REMOVE. OUR SUPPORT THINK. THANK YOU THAT'S WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MARJORIE MURRAY CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. CONSULTANT ANTHONY LOW FOR HIS OUR HEROIC WORK ON THIS BILL AND ALSO THE WIECKOWSKI BILL THE SUBJECT OF CAL OF ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMON INTERESTS DEVELOPMENTS. IS NOT AN EASY ONE TO GET YOUR ARMS AND YOUR BRAINS AROUND. AND THAT WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD A TO TRY TO SORT OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE TOPIC OF ELECTIONS BY ACCLAMATION HAS COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. THIS IS AT LEAST A THIRD OF ABOUT THE FORD -- WE DO HAVE SOME BASIC CONCERNS AND WERE ACTUALLY IN ON OPPOSE POSITION. ORIGINALLY ON THIS BILL -- WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NATURE OF ACCLAMATION AS OVERRIDING THE OF NATURE OF COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS WHICH ARE SELF GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS SO. USING ACCLAMATION AS A TOOL TO SEE BOARD DIRECTORS DOES REMAIN A CONCERN FOR US. HOWEVER WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON AMENDMENTS -- AS SENATOR ROTH EXPLAINED TO WORK OUT THE QUALIFICATIONS ISSUE AND TO WORK OUT SOME ISSUES AROUND NOTICE. SO I THINK THAT THE BILL IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL WORK MORE TO BE DONE. OF SO WE HAVE MODERATED OUR POSITION IN HOPES THAT SOME OF THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED. BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PRESENT TO OUR ERIC SHEFFER. OF WHO IS AN ATTORNEY WHO HAS LITIGATED THE ONLY PUBLISHED APPELLATE CASE IN THE CALIFORNIA COURTS ON ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS WHO WILL EXPAND ON THE TOPIC OF USING. A ACCLAMATION AS A TOOL FOR SEATING FOR DIRECTORS. THANK YOU RECKLESS WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP MARJORIE NOTED MY NAME IS ERIC SHIP FOR I AM A PRINCIPAL AT THE LAW FIRM. OF SHIVERING BOOSTS APC WERE LOCATED IN ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA. I AM A. S. CERTIFIED APPEL A SPECIALIST AND I WAS COUNSEL RECORD IN THE WITTENBERG VERSES BEACH WHAT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WHICH IS MURDER SAID. IS THE ONLY PUBLISHED OPINION ON THE IT TO ELECTION PROCESS -- MIGHT FIRM DOES REPRESENT MANY DISSENTING HOMEOWNERS OF THESE ISSUES DO COME UP MORE OFTEN THAN THAN YOU MAY THINK. AND THE ISSUE I WANTED -- TO DRESSED TO THE THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS THE ACCLAMATION ISSUE THE STATED GOAL IS TO IS THAT ARE DEEMED UNNECESSARY. BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE IN THE ACCLIMATION PROCESS THERE ACTUALLY IS AN ELECTION IT'S HELD EXCLUSIVELY BY SEATED BOARD MEMBERS. IT'S A VOTE UP BUT IT'S A VOTE DONE WITHOUT A BALLOT. SO THE ISSUE IS HOW IMPORTANT IS A BALLOT TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTION PROCESS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT -- WE START WITH THE PREMISE THAT H. AWAYS ARE BECAUSE I GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES MANY CASES HAVE SO HELD. AND AT SUCH A TO A BOARD ENGAGE IN CONDUCT CONSTITUTES MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST THE THINGS THEY DO. THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE MEMBERS HOMES -- SAID IN ANGER BALLOT VOTE ON MEMBERS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOMES CAN LEAD TO VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL OR AT THE VERY LEAST BECAUSE THEY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS -- MORE PORTLY I THINK IT OPENS THE DOOR TO ASSOCIATION BOARDS BEING ABLE TO STRIP THEIR OPPONENTS A VOTING RIGHTS WHICH AFFECTS THE EQUITY -- THE FAIRNESS IN THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS IT ALSO AFFECTS THE ABILITY TO DO WRITE IN VOTES -- AND IT ADDS IN AT A MECHANISM TO QUELL DISSENTING VIEWS -- AND ALL THIS BEING DONE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF COST SAVINGS I THINK CAN BE SEEN AS CHILLING THE VOTING PROCESS IN SOME INSTANCES. BOB CORDY THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF US TO LOOK AT FIFTY ONE OH FIVE WHICH AT THE TIME WAS THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE POINT OF THREE IT WAS ENACTED TO IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTING PROCESS AND BASED UPON FINDINGS. YEAH IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE ELECTIONS BOARD MEMBERS WERE CONTAMINATED BY OPPRESSION MANIPULATION AND INTIMIDATION OF MEMBERS I'VE HANDLED MANY CASES WHERE I'VE SEEN THOSE THINGS HAPPEN FIRST HANDED THOSE THOSE THINGS ARE REALIZADO. THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING ACCLAMATION PORTION I BELIEVE IS A STEP BACKWARDS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF COST SAVINGS AND I THINK THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS SO WITH THAT I WOULD SUBMIT MY COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND ALSO OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND THIS FOR THE COMMITTEE THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF CENTER WIECKOWSKI SPILL THAT WE'LL SEE LATER ON BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THESE ARE. IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD THAT THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO HARMONIZE SOME OF THE PROVISIONS [inaudible] AND THAT. IT'S DIFFICULT TO LOOK AT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. AS A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY BECAUSE IT IS SEEMS OPERATE MORE LIKE A NONPROFIT BUT YET BECAUSE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIVING THERE IT'S THEIR HOME WHO WERE. MAKING THE DECISION TO TO MOVE INTO A LOCATION LIKE THEY WOULD A CITY THAT THAT HAS THESE ADDITIONAL SETS OF RULES. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO LOOK AT THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN THE WAY THAT A A LOCAL AGENCY WOULD WORK. AND WHILE IN CITIES COUNTIES AND OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE. TO QUALIFY FOR ELECTION IT'S IN A POOR BECAUSE SAVING MESSAGE METHOD. TO DEEMED THOSE PEOPLE THAT ESSENTIALLY APPOINTED TO THE BOARD. IN THIS CASE HOWEVER SO BUT FOR CITIES COUNTIES THEY'RE VERY VERY FEW IF ANY RESTRICTIONS ON WHO CAN STAND FOR THOSE ELECTIONS. IN THESE CASES THE BOARD ITSELF HAS THE ABILITY TO CREATE RESTRICTIONS ON WHO IS ELIGIBLE. TO BE TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ND THROUGH POTENTIAL THE POTENTIAL MANIPULATION OF WHO'S ELIGIBLE. THAT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY THEN TO NARROW THE THOUGH THE FOCUS HAVE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO SIT ON A BOARD. THAT'S KIND OF THE HEART OF THE THE ISSUES THAT THAT I HAD WITH THIS AND I APPRECIATE SENATE ROTH BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH US. THROUGH THOSE ISSUES I THINK WE HAVE ULTIMATELY NO STANDING THAT. THE OPPOSITION TO ADD TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS BUT I THINK. HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS DO NEED TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY WHERE IT'S IT'S APPROPRIATE AND WE ALSO YOU HAVE SERVED BICU HAVE VERY LARGE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. WE ALSO NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT CRAFTING STATE LA TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MIGHT EXIST THERE AND I APPLAUD. YOUR DESIRE TO REDUCE THE COST ON YOUR RESIDENTS BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE THERE MANY DIFFERENT HOMEOWNERS THOSE ASIAN. MANY DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAT THIS IS GOING TO APPLY TO AND IN ANY CASE WHERE WE ARE RESTRICTING SOMEONE'S. ABILITY EVEN A DISSENTING VOICE TO SIT AND VOTE. ON SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THEM SO DIRECTLY I THINK THAT'S THE PART THAT WE HAVE. SO WITH BOTH THIS BILL AND THE WHITE HOUSE KEEP BILL. WE DO HAVE A VERY CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED -- DEAL THAT WAS MADE AND SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND IF THAT. IF THESE AMENDMENTS ARE CHANGE THROUGH THE PROCESS THEN THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE BRINGING THIS BILL OR SEMI CASSIE'S BILL IF HE DOES SOMETHING BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HARMONIZING THEM BECAUSE I I THINK WE HAVE. A PRETTY GOOD BALANCE HERE WITH THE ALL THE COMPETING INTERESTS SOMETHING THAT WE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO WITH SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN IN THE ISSUE OF OF ELECTIONS BACK MASON IS COME UP A LOT AND IT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT. THAT WE DO NEED. TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE. SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AND I APPRECIATE BOTH CENTER WIECKOWSKI AND ROB FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH US. TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS BOTH BILLS TO MOVE FORWARD BOTH BILLS [inaudible] TO EVEN THOUGH THAT THE APPROACHES WERE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WE TALK ABOUT THE SAME CODE TECHIES WE TALK ABOUT BASIC THE SAME THING. SO WE WE'RE ABLE TO HARMONIZE THESE IT TO A REASONABLE EXTENT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. STILL. LACKO QUORUM BUTTON CENTER YOU MAKE CLUBS MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU IN THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION APPRECIATE. THANK YOU WE WILL TAKE THIS UP ONLY. HAVE ENOUGH OF A QUORUM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. SO WE NOW GO TO SENATOR LEYVA HUNDRED YOU HAVE TWO BILLS BEFORE US. ITEM NUMBER FIVE S. B. EIGHT TWENTY AND ITEM NUMBER TEN SB. TEN THIRTY EIGHT YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE. ALRIGHT WE WILL TOO ITEM NUMBER FIVE S. B.. EIGHT TWENTY WELL GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS HAPPY ALMOST FOURTH OF JULY. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY ALSO KNOWN AS THE STAND ACT THE STAND TOGETHER AGAINST NON DISCLOSURE ACTS WOULD PAN SECRET SETTLEMENTS IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES. THIS IMPORTANT BILL WILL EMPOWER VICTIMS BY ALLOWING THEM TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIALITY IF SHE OR HE REQUIRES AND CHOOSES. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT ENFORCE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS IF THEY INVOLVE A FELONY CHARGE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR RAPE AND CASES OF ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. SO S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TAKES THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP BY COVERING ALL CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT AND DISCRIMINATION. AS WE HAVE CLEARLY SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS SEXUAL HARASSMENT OTHER TYPES OF NON FELONY SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE STILL ALLOWED TO BE HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC EYE VIA SECRET SETTLEMENTS. IN SHORT SECRET SETTLEMENTS HELP PERPETRATORS EVADE JUSTICE. I THINK A LOT ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND THAT SCANDAL AND HOW IT THE VERY FIRST VICTIM HADN'T BEEN ALLOWED TO ARE MADE TO SIGN. A SECRET SETTLEMENT MAYBE THE SEVENTY NINE OTHER WOMEN WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HELP. THIS CYCLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IS NOT NEW WE'VE ALL SEEN IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN INSTANCES IN WHICH RICH AND POWERFUL PEOPLE AND COMPANIES. HIDE BEHIND THEIR ABILITY TO USE SECRET SETTLEMENTS AND THE CURTAIN OF SECRECY TO KEEP THEIR VICTIMS QUIET. BY SHINING A LIGHT ON EFFORTS TO SILENT VIC'S SILENCE VICTIMS SB EIGHT TWENTY WILL KEEP THESE AGGRESSORS ACCOUNTABLE AND PREVENT THEM FROM PREYING ON OF THE VICTIMS. WE ALL DESERVE TO LIVE AND WORK FREE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT DISCRIMINATION. IN S. B. EIGHT TWENTY ONE POWER VICTIMS SO THAT DAY AND NOT BE HARASSER OR THE ATTACKER CAN DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEMSELVES. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS ALEXIS MCKENNA WITH THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND SHANE GUSMAN WITH SAG AFTRA. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ALEXIS MCKENNA I REPRESENT EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEES IN EMPLOYMENT CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA A CO SPONSOR ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S LAW CENTER OF SP. EIGHT TWENTY S. B. A TWENTY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF SECRET SETTLEMENTS AND EMPLOYMENT CASES. DURING MY EIGHTEEN YEARS OF REPRESENTING HARASSMENT VICTIMS I'VE SEEN A GROWING TREND WHERE EMPLOYERS INSIST UPON THE EMPLOYEE. AGREEING TO A NON DISCLOSURE AND NON DISPARAGEMENT BECAUSE IN ORDER TO SETTLE THESE CLAIMS. THESE CASES OFTEN INVOLVE A PERSON IN A POSITION OF POWER OF SUPERVISOR A MANAGER AND EXECUTIVE. USING HIS OR HER POSITION TO SUBJECT A LOWER LEVEL EMPLOYEE. A SEXUAL DEGRADATION HUMILIATION AND ADVANCES. ONE WOULD THINK THAT STOPPING THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WOULD BE A PUBLIC POLICY CONCERN WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE PUBLIC LIGHT. TO ENSURE THAT THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR DOES NOT REOCCUR. IT INCREASINGLY DEFENDANTS INSIST ON SECRECY SO THAT SO THAT IF A VICTIM WANTS PERSONAL CLOSURE FOR THEIR ORDEAL. THEIR FORBIDDEN TO ENGAGE IN ANY EFFORT TO INSURE THAT THE SAME BEHAVIOR DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ANOTHER UNSUSPECTING EMPLOYEE. SOME WILL ARGUE THAT SECRET SETTLEMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE A SETTLEMENT IN OTHER WORDS THE DEFENDANT WILL NEVER SETTLE A CASE UNLESS THE INFORMATION IS KEPT QUIET. HOWEVER AGAIN THIS IS A GROWING TREND. NOT ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE INSISTED ON THIS AND IT USED TO BE UNCOMMON AND SETTLEMENTS WERE FLUCTUATED. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROHIBITED SECRET SETTLEMENTS AND OTHER CONTACTS SUCH AS CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE. AND OUR MEMBERS REPORT THESE CASES DO STILL SUBTLE BUT WITHOUT SECRECY. AS WE'VE SEEN IN REPEATED EXAMPLES THE USE OF SECRET SETTLEMENTS HAVE BECOME RAMPANT. AND ALLOW PERPETRATORS TO CONTINUE HARASSMENT WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY. THE PUBLIC POLICY CONCERNS REGARDING THIS BEHAVIOR AND THE ELEMENT OF DETERMINED DETERRENCE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS CASES MAKE CLEAR THE NEED TO ELIMINATE THESE EMPLOYER MANDATED SECRECY CAUSES. SECRET SETTLEMENTS IN SEX OFFENSE CASES ARE MAJOR REASON WHY PREDATORS. WHETHER WITHIN FOX NEWS HARVEY WEINSTEIN OR EVEN BILL COSBY WERE ABLE TO HIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT. SO MANY YEARS. CHAU C. STRONGLY BELIEVES THE LEGISLATURE MUST INTERVENE TO SHIFT THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE PARTIES WHO DEMAND SECRECY TO SETTLE A CLAIM. AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN CURBING HARASSMENT AND ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT'S WHERE A CO SPONSORING SP EIGHT TWENTY BY SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU ATLAS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF SAG AFTRA -- IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- OBVIOUSLY MANY OF THAT -- MORE INFAMOUS CASES IN RECENT TIMES HAVE COME FROM OUR INDUSTRY BUT THIS BY NO MEANS IS IS -- ONLY OCCURRING. ACROSS OUR CULTURE -- AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS IT UNFORTUNATELY SECRET SETTLEMENTS HAVE BEEN USED AS A WEAPON FOR PERPETRATORS TO KEEP ON COMMITTING THAT HEINOUS ACTS THAT THEY COMMIT -- NOT JUST TO PROTECT A COMPANY'S REPUTATION BUT TO ACTUALLY SHIELD A PERPETRATOR AND ALLOW THEM TO GO ON DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND THAT OUR VIEW IT'S TIME THAT WE PUT A STOP TO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. LARRY DOYLE ON BEHALF OF THE COVERS THE CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS IN SUPPORT. JEAN HYAMS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE RECENT AMENDMENTS AND STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CRISTINA CARO REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING JESSICA STAND ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING PAMELA GUEST A NATIONAL OF BOARD AND LOCAL BOARD OF SCREEN ACTOR'S GUILD AFTER. AND I AM STRONGLY SO STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SO THAT PEOPLE CAN I KNOW. LAURA LEE MARTIN FORMER EMPLOYER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN SUPPORT. GINA FELLOW WITH PEOPLE RISING STRONGLY SUPPORT. ROBIN BIDSTON THE REMEMBRANCE PROJECT IN SUPPORT. IF YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN TO HAVE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB -- EIGHT TWENTY WITH REGARDS TO THE PROVISIONS ARE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS. I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO INTERFERE WITH ALL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND SUGGEST THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE I THINK EMPLOYERS THAT GETS INTO THE REASON AS TO WHY. SETTLE CASES ONE THEY SETTLE CARE CASES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THERE IS MERIT TO THE CASE AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THOSE CASES I DON'T THINK THIS BILL WILL IMPACT THOSE EMPLOYERS. WHO ARE UP BELIEVE THAT THERE'S LIABILITY EXPOSURE AND OF THAT INVESTIGATION AND FIND THAT A SUPERVISOR HAS ENGAGED IN POTENTIALLY HARASSING CONDUCT ARE LIKELY GOING TO SETTLE THOSE CASES REGARDLESS BECAUSE GOING TO TRIAL JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THEM? BUT THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY EMPLOYER SETTLE CASES ARE BECAUSE I THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THE CASE HAS MERIT BY GOING TO COURT AND GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH TRIAL IS A BUSINESS DECISION IT'S EXPENSIVE AYE IT REQUIRES THEM TO PAY FOR THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES AND PAY FOR ALL THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRIAL AND SO THEY WILL ENGAGE IN A SETTLEMENT. DISCUSSION NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T. BECAUSE IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO RESOLVE THE CASE EARLY TO SAY THAT MONEY AND TO JUST MOVE ON AND IN THOSE CASES WHEN WE UTILIZE -- EIGHT CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION IT IS TO MAINTAIN THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE COMPANY THAT IS NECESSARILY AT FAULT WITH ESPECIALLY IN HARASSMENT CASES WHEN IT'S A SUPERVISOR WHO HAS ENGAGED IN THE CONDUCT AND THE EMPLOYER HAD NO IDEA ABOUT IT UNTIL IT WAS REPORTED. ITS STRICT LIABILITY NO MATTER IF THE EMPLOYER IMMEDIATELY TERMINATES THAT INDIVIDUAL ARE NOT AND TAKES IMMEDIATE ACTION THEY'RE STILL LIABLE AND SO AGAIN IF THEY RESOLVE THE CASE AND THEY HAVE A CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION IN PLACE TO MAINTAIN THE REPUTATION. THAT'S EFFECTIVE FOR PURPOSES OF THE SETTLEMENT IF THEY CAN NO LONGER DO THAT IT WILL ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO GO TO TRIAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR REPUTATION IS IN PLACE AT THE CAN DEFEND THE TO A CASE OF TRAVELS. ULTIMATELY BE SUCCESSFUL SO I DO THINK THAT THERE WILL BE SOME INTERFERENCE WITH SOME SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SAYING THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THAT. THAT I THINK THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE BELL UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THAT WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED CONFIDENCE HILL PALADIN RAN A LOT OF THESE AYE I DO AGREE. TENDS TO BENEFIT THE PERPETRATOR AND ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO PREDATE AND THEY BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT RE VICTIMIZING THE VICTIM AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE VICTIM DOES NOT WANT. TO BE. MADE THEIR NAME TO MAY PUBLIC THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE MADE PUBLIC SAID THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE EVEN HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. AND WE HAVE ALSO TOO LONG HELD. VERY BAD BEHAVIOR FROM LEGISLATORS AND STAFF IN CONFIDENCE WHICH MEANS THAT THE PUBLIC IN OUR VOTERS DON'T HAVE THEY THE ABILITY TO KNOW ABOUT THAT BAD BEHAVIOR ALLOWING. FOR CONTINUATION OF THAT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO STOP. SO I DO I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF SOME OF THE BUSINESSES HAVE WITH THIS BUT ISRAEL TO IN THE ABOUT US AND IF WE ARE GOING. TO CONTINUED TO SHIELD ADVERT LEERING AT HER AND LAY PERPETRATORS THAT ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO RE OFFEND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT STATED CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE ABSOLUTELY SERIOUSLY. AND THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL UP AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY SUPPORT AND OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S WHY WE ADDED IN THE BILL THAT THE VICTIM CAN REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERPETRATOR IS. OUTED SO TO SPEAK US SO THAT WAY PEOPLE KNOW THE COMPANY THEY'RE GOING TO WORK -- FOR THEY WILL KNOW ABOUT THIS PERSON IF THEY'RE GOING TO WORK FOR THEM ONSITE WRIST IDEA APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT RESPECT FAST FOR LIFE OF THANK YOU THANK. ALRIGHT THEN WE'LL GO TO ANOTHER ITEM NUMBER TEN SB [inaudible] TEN THIRTY EIGHT ALRIGHTY. WELL GOOD MORNING AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU. S. B. TEN THIRTY EIGHT WILL STRENGTHEN ANTI RETALIATION PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION BY HOLDING INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGED IN HARASSING OR DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT PERSONALLY LIABLE. IN RETALIATING AGAINST A VICTIM FOR EXERCISING HER OR HIS RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AT THE H. A UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON MAY ALREADY A WHOLE BE HELD PERSONALLY LIABLE. FOR HARASSMENT CLAIMS UNDER FEE HA HOWEVER INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT BE HELD PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR RETALIATION DUE TO AN INTERPRETER INTERPRETATION. BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WHICH RENDERED THE ISSUE UNCLEAR. IF THERE'S NO INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY FOR THE RETALIATION YOU MAY ACTUALLY END UP INCENTIVIZING HARASSER TO JUST GET RID OF THE PERSON WHO WAS HARASSED. IN THE END THE HARASSER MIGHT EVEN AVOID LIABILITY FOR THE HARASSMENT AS WELL IF THEY SUCCESSFULLY SILENCE THE VICTIM. S. B. TEN THIRTY EIGHT WAS RECENTLY AMENDED SO THAT ONLY THE PERSON WHO ENGAGED IN THE HARASSING CONDUCT MAY BE HELD PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR RETALIATION CONNECTION WITH THE UNDERLYING HARASSMENT CLAIM. THESE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN THAT THIS BILL COULD SUBJECT INDIVIDUALS UNCONNECTED TO THE HARASSMENT CLAIM TO PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR MAKING IT ADVERSE PERSONAL DECISION. WITH THE RECENT CHANGES THE ONLY ONLY THE HARASSER CAN BE HELD PERSONALLY LIABLE IF HE OR SHE TRIES TO RETALIATE OR SILENCE A VICTIM. AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE ME TOO AND WE SAID ENOUGH MOVEMENTS THREATS AND FEAR OF RETALIATION OR ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS FOR WOMEN AND MEN WHO WISH TO SPEAK OUT OR FILE SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS. THESE BILLS THESE CONCERNS AND FEARLESS FEARS ARE VALID AND WELL FOUNDED. WHEN REPORTS COME OUT THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN HARASSED IN THE WORKPLACE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS IS? WHY DIDN'T SHE SAY ANYTHING? ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STUDY BY THE US EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION 75% OF EMPLOYEES WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST WORKPLACE MISTREATMENT FACE SOME SORT OF RETALIATION. INDIVIDUALS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY TRIED INTERFERE WITH THREATEN OR OTHERWISE RETALIATES AGAINST SOMEONE WHO HAS MADE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM. WE MUST NEVER ALLOW VICTIMS TO BE VICTIMIZED AGAIN [inaudible] OR SILENCED HERE WITH ME TODAY IS JEAN HYMES AND JUST ACOSTA UNDER. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF SELAH THE CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. MY NAME IS JIM HIMES AND I'M A FOUNDING PARTNER OF LEVY VINIK BURRELL HYAMS A WOMEN OWNED FIRM IN THE BAY AREA. WE PROSECUTE CASES AROUND THE STATE ON BEHALF OF WORKERS HAVE EXPERIENCED HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND OFTEN RETALIATION. GIVING WORKERS A VOICE AND HELPING THEM BREAK THE SILENCE SURROUNDING THEIR EXPERIENCE IS CENTRAL TO THE WORK WE DO. S. B. TEN THIRTY EIGHT CLOSES AND EGREGIOUS ESCAPE PATCH FOR HARASSERS. IT'S AN ESCAPE HATCH THAT CURRENTLY LETS THEM AVOID PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR RETALIATING AGAINST THE VICTIMS THEY HARASSED. AND HOOKED TRIED TO SPEAK OUT AND STOP THE HARASSMENT. HAVING LISTEN TO THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL WORKERS STORIES OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER. I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT MAY SURPRISE YOU GIVEN THE PREVAILING. NARRATIVE THAT OURS IS AN OVERLY LITIGIOUS SOCIETY. WORKERS PUT UP WITH A LOT OF SUFFERING BEFORE THEY THINK ABOUT BRINGING A LAWSUIT. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR SEXUAL OR RACIAL HARASSMENT TO GO ON MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS BEFORE WORKER COMPLAINS. THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE EASY TO UNDERSTAND. PEOPLE NEED THEIR JOBS. THEY'RE AFRAID OF ROCKING THE BOAT AND THEY KNOW THAT COMPLAINING CAN PUT A TARGET ON THEIR BACKS. AND THAT THEY RISK LOSING THEIR JOBS. AND THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY WORKERS WHO MY FIRM AND OTHER CEILING MEMBERS HAVE REPRESENTED OVER THE YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY PROVES THEIR FEARS RIGHT FAR TOO OFTEN. I THINK I'VE ON AMONG TALIBAN WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF SB. TEN THIRTY EIGHT MS MONTALVO ON WAS PROMOTED UP THROUGH THE RANKS TO THE ROLE OF REGIONAL ACCOUNT MANAGER AT AN INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS COMPANY. DURING A CAREER WITH THE COMPANY THAT LASTED MORE THAN A DECADE. HOWEVER AFTER SHE REJECTED THE ADVANCES OF FOR SUPERVISOR AT A BUSINESS DINNER. WHERE HE CARESSED HER LEGS UNDER THE TABLE AND FORCED A KISS ON HER? I PROMISE PROMOTION WAS TAKEN AWAY. INSTEAD OF THE PROMOTION SHE WAS ASSIGNED SUB PAR ACCOUNTS AND DEMOTED AND ULTIMATELY FORCED TO END THE CAREER SHE HAD WORKED OVER A DECADE TO BUILD. ALL THIS WHILE THE SUPERVISOR SHE ALLEGED RETALIATED AGAINST HER [inaudible] WAS PROMOTED. HARASSERS TO TURN AROUND AND RETALIATE OR TRY TO SILENCE THE PERSON WHO REPORTED THEIR BEHAVIOR NEED TO KNOW THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR MANY YEARS THIS WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CALIFORNIA TOOK A STEP BACKWARD WHEN THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS DECISION. IN JONES VERSUS THE LOGIC TORREY PINES. BEFORE THAT TIME CALIFORNIA WAS IN STEP WITH MOST OTHER STATES IN THE NATION IN HOLDING INDIVIDUALS PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR RETALIATION. BUT THE DECISION AND TORREY PINES CHANGE THAT AND SINCE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF WORKERS RIGHTS LAW WHERE STATES LIKE ALABAMA AND TENNESSEE. OFFER GREATER WORKER PROTECTION THAN THE GOLDEN STATE. IN HIS DISSENTING OPINION JUSTICE MARINO URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ACTION TO CLOSE THE ESTATE ESCAPE HATCH. THAT THE TORREY PINES CASE OPENED. HE WROTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD NOT HAVE INTENDED TO EXPOSE A SUPERVISOR TO INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY FOR HARASSING AN EMPLOYEE ON THE ONE HAND. WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND SHIELDING THAT SUPERVISOR FROM LIABILITY FOR RETALIATING AGAINST THE EMPLOYEE FOR OPPOSING THE VERY SAME HARASSMENT MELANIE TO WRAP UP PLEASE AYE WELL THANK YOU -- IF WE HAVE ANY HOPE OF CHANGING THE CULTURE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WE HAVE TO PREVENT THE REALITY OF RETALIATION. A GOOD FIRST STEP IS TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO VICTIMS THAT IT'S SAFE TO REPORT WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND ISN'T AS CLEAR MESSAGE TO RETALIATE HERS THAT THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU. THANK. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE SOME NOT MUCH TO ADD JUST DOESN'T EXTENDER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL I JUST ADD THAT WE REPRESENT PRIMARILY LOW WAGE WORKERS AND THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO THESE WORKERS GOING FORWARD. IS FEAR OF RETALIATION OFTEN THAT RETALIATION IS ALREADY BEEN THREATENED BY THE TIME THEY CALL US AND OFTEN THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM FROM ACTUALLY PURSUING ANY KIND OF CLAIM SO FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU JUST HEARD WE REALLY STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT JACQUI STERN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. IF YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. BY DENNIS SEATON ON BEHALF OF CHURCH STATE COUNTENANCE WORK. FAMILY GUEST IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. IT WOULD ALSO SUPPORT. SEEING NONE SIR OPPOSITION -- CHAIR MEMBERS STILL GIVES WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE ARE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANKS TO THE AMENDMENTS ASTRO AND WE ARE NEUTRAL ON BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU.

LINER COMMENTS FROM OF OPPOSITION FROM THE MEASURE THINK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSED OR REMOVING OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SING NONE AMONG A BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AND AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE THANK YOU WE WANT TO GIVE UP ON ME. GET A QUORUM ITSELF HAD SOMETIME THIS OKAY BILLY. THEY COULD RESEARCHER THANK YOU MEMBERS RIGHT SENATOR MONEY THAT TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN S. B. [inaudible] ELEVEN TWENTY NINE MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- AND LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LIKE TO ESPECIALLY THANK YOU AND COMMITTEE STAFF FREER. EXCELLENT. WORK IN HELPING TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL SO IN ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR WITH OUR STAFF THANK YOU SENATOR. MEMBER SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE WILL CRACKED IN INJUSTICE FOUNDING CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FAMILY LAW CODES WHERE ONLY CERTAIN SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO PROTECTED. FROM BEING FORCED TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORTTHEIR ABUSIVE SPOUSE AT THE END OF A MARRIAGE. CURRENT LAW SHIELDS VICTIMS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER AND VICTIMS OF VIOLENT SEXUAL FELONIES FROM HAVING TO PAY THEIR VIEWS OR SPOUSAL SUPPORT. ATTORNEY'S FEES OUT OF THEIR SEPARATE PROPERTY WERE FUTURE INCOME FROM INTEREST IN THEIR PENSION OR RETIREMENT. SURVIVORS OF ALL OTHER FORMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOWEVER CANNOT BENEFIT FROM THIS IMPORTANT FINANCIAL PROTECTION. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE ADDRESSES THIS IN EQUITY BY EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR THESE PROTECTIONS TO ALL SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THROUGH A BIFURCATED SYSTEM. IT PROVIDES GUIDANCE AS TO WHEN THE COURTS CAN AWARD SUPPORT TO AN ABUSIVE FORMER SPOUSE. IF YOU ABUSER IS CONVICTED IN A CRIMINAL COURT OF FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MEANING THEY'RE LIKELY HEADED TO PRISON. FOR HEINOUS ACT AGAINST THEIR SPOUSE COURT WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM ORDERING FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FROM THE SURVIVOR. IF AN ABUSER IS FOUND GUILTY BACK CRIMINAL COURT OF MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC BALANCE THEN THE ABUSER WILL FACE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE SPOUSAL SUPPORT. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE MAINTAINS EXISTING LAW THAT ALLOWS A SURVIVOR OF ABUSE WHO FIGHTS BACK AGAINST THEIR SPOUSE AND WHO SUBSEQUENTLY CONVICTED OF ABUSE THEMSELVES. TO PRESENT THIS EVIDENCE OF THEIR HISTORY IS A VICTIM. BEFORE A JUDGE IN ORDER TO REBUT THE PRESUMPTION. FINALLY THE CHAIRS AMENDMENTS WILL FURTHER CLARIFY THAT INSTANCES THAT ANY INSTANCES OF A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION THE JUDGE WILL HAVE COMPLETE DISCRETION. IN DETERMINING IF THE INJURED SPOUSE IS ENTITLED TO ALL OR SOME OF THEIR INTEREST IN THE COMMUNITY PROPERTY PENSION. WELL FAMILY LAW PROFESSIONALS HAVE SHARED AND WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. WE FEEL WE HAVE CRAFTED A BALANCED AND THOUGHTFUL APPROACH. PROTECTING SURVIVORS THAT HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO DATE. STANDING THESE PROTECTIONS TO ALL VICTIMS NOT ONLY CREATES PARITY IN THE LAW IT WILL ENSURE THAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO SURVIVED THE INSIDIOUS EICHEL OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. ARE NOT RE VICTIMIZED BY HAVING TO SUPPORT THEIR ABUSER AFTER THEY'VE SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING THE MARRIAGE. I WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND MISTER CHAIR WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO PRESENT ONE WITNESS. AND THEN IF WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION I OF A SHORT STATEMENT FROM A WITNESS WHO BECAUSE OF HER CIRCUMSTANCES ISN'T ABLE TO APPEAR PUBLICLY. HAVE A SHORT STATEMENT THAT I'D LIKE TO READ MISSION -- FROM THE VICTIM. BUT AT A DECIDER BY INTRODUCED FIRST WITNESS OUR FIRST WITNESS. GOOD MORNING -- I'M LAURA LEE MARTIN -- I'M PART OF THE HIDDEN DEMOGRAPHIC OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS I'M HIDDEN BUT NOT UNIQUE. I'M AN EDUCATED WOMAN WHO HAD A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. HAS EARNED A GOOD INCOMING WHO LIVES IN A NICE HOUSE. ON THE OUTSIDE EVERYTHING LOOK PERFECT BUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RAGED. I'M SIXTY FOUR I'M DISABLED I OF A RARE HEART CONDITION I'M ON SST AYE IN THE FIXED PENSION. I CARE FOR AN ADULT SON DISABLED SON WHO SUFFERED A BRAIN INJURY IN HIS HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION TRIP TO DISNEYLAND TWO YEARS AGO. I AM A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT SPANNED NEARLY THIRTY TWO YEARS. THIS BILL HITS CLOSE TO HOME BUT IT WON'T BENEFIT ME. I WAS EMPLOYED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE STARTED THE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN THE LEGISLATURE TEN YEARS AGO. IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE I WAS CONFIDENT EFFECTIVE AT HOME I LIVED ON EGGSHELLS I FREAK FEARED FOR MY LIFE. AND THE SAFETY OF MY SON. I'D SLEEP ON THE GROUND FOR GUESTROOM SAGA CLIMB OUT A WINDOW AT THE CAR BACK IN THE DRIVEWAY I HAD A NOTE IN MY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX THAT SAID IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME IT WAS MY HUSBAND. ONLY AFTER MY SON'S BRAIN INJURY AS ME. DID MY SON'S SAFETY OUT WAY MY OWN FEAR OF THE FINANCIAL LOSS. CURRENT LAWS PROTECT ME FROM PAYING SPOUSAL SUPPORT SORRY. I HAD IT TOGETHER. THEY DO NOT PROTECT ME FROM LOSING UP 250% OF MY PENSION AND MY RETIREMENT SAVINGS. I'M LIVING ON THOSE WITH MONIES. THOSE PENSION RETIREMENT DOLLARS IT IS NO DIFFERENT TO ME THAN PROVIDING HIM WITH SPOUSAL SUPPORT. HE GAINES I LOSE UNLESS I STAY MARRIED TO HIM. IF I'D STAYED IN THIS RELATIONSHIP UNTIL YOU TRIED TO MURDER ME. I WOULDN'T LOSE ANY RETIREMENT PENSION INCOME UNDER STATE LAW. THE LINE OF LUCK BETWEEN ATTEMPTED MURDER AND MURDER IS TOO THIN AND UNPREDICTABLE TO BE WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE INTENDED TO BE. THE BEST TO PROTECT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. MY HUSBAND PLAYED A MY FEAR OF FINANCIAL INSECURITY TO KEEP ME CAPTIVE. HIS RETURN ON INVESTMENT INCREASED WITH THE YEARS OF ABUSE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT DENYING IN NICE GUY WHO SHARE OF COMMUNITY PROPERTY EARNED DURING THE MARRIAGE. IT'S ABOUT FINANCE FUTURE FINANCIAL REWARD. FOR SOMEBODY WHO EXTRACTED FROM THE VICTIM DURING THE GOING PERPETRATION OF THE CRIME. IT REWARDS THIS VICTIM ANY VICTIM WILL PAY TO THE ABUSER FOR THE REST OF THE VICTIM'S LIFE. IT SORT OF MOVES INTO THE LINE OF ELDER ABUSE AT THAT POINT. FINANCIALLY MY HUSBAND WILL BE REWARDED. MY SON AND I WILL STRUGGLE. THIS BILL WILL ALSO HELP REMOVE THE FINANCIAL INSECURITY THAT HOLDS MANY VICTIMS LIKE IT DID ME CAPTIVE. AND I WILL SEND THE MESSAGE TO ABUSERS AT THERE'S OF FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE FOR THEIR ABUSE. IT WILL HELP VICTIMS LIKE ME COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS. I'M STILL MARRIED TO MY HUSBAND. THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING AMBER SO DIRE GIVEN MY AGE MY DISABILITY AND MY NEED TO CARE FOR MY SON I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I HAVE THE OPTION TO CIVIL COURT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO LET HIM PLEAD BARGAIN DOWN. I'D HAVE TO START ALL OVER IN CIVIL COURT BECAUSE I CAN'T CARRY THAT CONVICTION FORWARD THAT WAS A DECISION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAD NO SAY IN THAT. I URGE YOU TO VOTE POSITIVELY FOR THIS. I THANK SENATOR. MINING FOR OFFERING THIS BILL AND I RESPECT AND THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU CENTER YOU HAD A STATEMENTYOU WANT YES THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE SECOND SUPPORT WITNESS WAS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE WHO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE HERE TODAY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WAS FORCED TO LEAVE THE STATE AND CHANGE HER IDENTITY IN ORDER TO FULLY ESCAPE HER ABUSIVE SPOUSE. WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR WHICH I'VE REQUESTED ON READ THE SHORT EXCERPT. DEAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M WRITING IN HOPES THAT YOU WILL HELP VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A WAY THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE TO ME. MY CASE IS COMPLETE I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY HOWEVER I EMBARKED ON THIS JOURNEY TO WORK WITH SENATOR MINING TO CHANGE LEGISLATION SO THAT OTHERS WOULD BE PROTECTED FROM AND I DEEMED. AN UNETHICAL LOOPHOLE IN CALIFORNIA FAMILY LAW. HAVE NOTHING TO PERSONALLY GAIN BY URGING THIS LEGISLATIVE CHANGE I'M MINERALOGIST WHO TRAINED AT ONE OF THOSE IVY LEAGUE IVORY TOWER INSTITUTIONS. I'M YOUNG I HAVE IN HAD A GOOD STEADY INCOME. I HAD A RESPECTABLE EDUCATION A KNOWLEDGE BASEASSOCIATED WITH IDENTIFYING ABUSE AND PSYCHOPATHIC. I WAS EVEN ON MY PSYCHIATRIC ROTATION AT THE NUMBER ONE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION IN THE COUNTRY WHEN I MARRIED. HOWEVER NONE OF THIS EDUCATION PROTECTED ME. I UNDERSTAND TO MY MARRIAGE WITH NO WARNING SIGNS AND THE ABUSE WAS INTRODUCED IN A SLOW CALCULATED WAY. THAT LED ME TO BE BOTH FEARFUL. FULL OF GUILT AND SERVITUDE ALL AT THE SAME TIME. I'VE SINCE LEARNED THIS IS ALL PART OF THE VICTIMIZATION CYCLE. IN THE END HE NEARLY ENDED MY LIFE LAYING IN WAIT WITH A SHOT GUN UNDER MY BED AFTER HEATED STRANGLING INCIDENT. I THOUGHT CALIFORNIA WAS A PROGRESSIVE STATE UNTIL I WENT THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE LOS INTENDED TO FINANCIALLY BENEFIT ABUSERS BUT I DO THINK THEY WERE WRITTEN AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS ASSUMED ONLY WOMEN COULD BE ABUSED. AND ONLY MEN COULD EARN AN INCOME. THIS IS THE REALITY IS ANYONE IS SUBJECT TO ABUSE NO MATTER THEIR MEANS STATUS OR GENDER. I TRULY HOPE YOU PASS THIS BILL I'M AFRAID IF YOU DON'T IT SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT IN CALIFORNIA. IT LITERALLY PAYS TO BE AN ABUSIVE SPOUSE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. SIGNED JANE DOE. THANK YOU AND ON WITH THAT. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GINA FELLA WITH THE PEOPLE RISING STRONGLY SUPPORT. ROBIN BIDSTON THE REMEMBRANCE PROJECT IN SUPPORT. ROLL RODRIGUEZ AMERICA FIRST LATINOS AND SUPPORT. AMERICAN CHILDREN'S FIRST IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE SINCE. I THINK NONE OPPOSITION. JEAN MACLEOD SAVE OUR STATE I'M IN SUPPORT [inaudible] RIGHT. POSITION TO S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY NINE THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS AVI LEVY AND I'M A CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALISTS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALISTS ALSO KNOWN AS AC FLS. AC FLS THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MEMBERS. ALL OF WHO ARE CERTIFIED AS FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST BY THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. BOARD OF LEGAL SPECIALIZATION. ACF ALAS ABHORS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BELIEVES. THIS COMMITTEE MUST FOCUS ON THE OVERRIDING ISSUE OF PROTECTING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHAT S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY NINE DOES IS IT ELEVATES FINANCIAL ISSUES SUCH A SPOUSAL SUPPORT? ATTORNEYS FEES AND PENSION RIGHTS OVER OF VICTIMS PROTECTION. AC UP FELL S. BELIEVES THAT S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY NINE WILL HAVE THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF ACTUALLY HARMING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT WILL TAKE AWAY ALL JUDICIAL DISCRETION. IN AWARDING SPOUSAL SUPPORT TO CHIU VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FELONY CONVICTIONS. AND WILL END UP FORCING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO TESTIFY. IN EVERY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE AS NO ALLEGED ABUSE WILL PLEAD GUILTY TO A LESSER OFFENSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NOT EVEN TO A MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE. DUE TO A POTENTIAL LOSS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS [inaudible] AND SUPPORT. S. B.. ELEVEN TWENTY NINE BECAUSE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THEREBY MAKING IT MORE DANGEROUS FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THAT IT WILL RESULT IN ALMOST EVERY CRIMINAL CHARGE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURT TRIAL. AND WILL LIKELY CAUSE BLAHBLAH CASES OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY. TO RESULT IN ACQUITTALS. WITH THE CURRENT LAW IN PLACE THERE IS NO THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR ALLEGED ABUSERS TO PLEAD TO A LESSER OFFENSE AND AVOID A TRIAL. THIS RESULT IN A HIGHER CONVICTION RATE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATORS. AND AVOID THE VICTIM FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE TRAUMA. TESTIFYING IN CRIMINAL COURT AGAINST HER ABUSIVE SPOUSE. ALTHOUGH THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS MAKE A DISTINCTION. BETWEEN OF MANDATORY LAS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND FELONY CONVICTIONS -- VERSES A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE LOSS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS ONE ALLEGED ABUSER IS ADVISED OF THIS POTENTIAL LOSS THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO PLAY OUT. THEY WILL TAKE THEIR CHANCES AT TRIAL WHERE THE ALLEGED ABUSER WILL HAVE A PUBLIC DEFENDER REPRESENTING THEM. AND THE VICTIM WILL HAVE TO STAND TRIAL TO TESTIFY AGAINST HER ABUSER RELIVED THE ABUSE. THIS BILL COULD LEAD TO ATTRIBUTE THEIR TO UPDATE AFFECT THEM. INTO RETALIATORY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ATTEMPT TO ENSURE HE DOES THAT HAVE TO PAY SPOUSAL SUPPORT BEEN A LONG TERM MARRIAGE. OR SHARE HIS LUCRATIVE PENSION WITH THE SPOUSE. IT BECAUSE THE VICTIM WHO WAS DEFENDING HERSELF FINALLY OR WHO FINALLY SNAPPED AND WAS CRIMINALLY CONVICTED. OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO LOSE ALL RIGHTS TO SUPPORT AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND NOT EVEN HAVE THE FUNDS TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY [inaudible] DEFEND HERSELF. FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THIS BILL THE COURT WOULD HAVE NO DISCRETION TOWARD SPOUSAL SUPPORT ATTORNEY FEES OR RETIREMENT BENEFITS TO A STATE HOME WIFE. AND MOTHER IN A TWENTY FIVE YEAR MARRIAGE WHO WAS A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HER ENTIRE LIFE. AND FINALLY HAD ENOUGH SNAPPED AT THROUGH A VASE OF HER HUSBAND MADE HIM BLEED WAS CONVICTED OF A FELONY [inaudible] SHE'S DOT. AND THEN S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY NINE PROVIDES A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE LAST OF THESE RIGHTS FOR MISDEMEANORS ARTICULATELY NOT IRREPARABLY OF COURSE. I'M IN THIS SITUATION THERE MANY TIMES WHERE A WIFE WOULD SEND HER RESTING TEXT MESSAGE OR EMAIL TO HER HUSBAND PLEADING HIM TO COME BACK FOR THE CHILDREN OR WHATEVER. AND THAT COULD BE ALSO CONSIDERED A MISDEMEANOR -- CHARGE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE AND NOT CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AGAINST THAT PERSON FROM FROM GETTING ANY SUPPORT OR FEES OR PENSION. AND FOR ALL THOSE REASONS A THEOPHILUS PURCHASE A NAY VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU EXODUS PLEASE. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS KENDAL EVANS. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY LAW SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION -- I AM A FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY MY PRACTICES BASED IN LONG BEACH AND I PERSONALLY REPRESENT A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. AS PRACTITIONERS OF FAMILY LAW FLEX COMMENTS HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE UNLESS AMENDED. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM AC FLS NOTED [inaudible] I ARE. THE FAMILY LAW COMMUNITY IS AWARE OF AND WORKS ON THE FRONTLINES IN AREAS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE AND WE ARE. ACUTELY AWARE OF THE INJURY PAIN AND TRAUMA SUFFERED BY THE VICTIMS. THIS SESSION REGARDING -- EIGHT NINE AB NINE TWENTY NINE FLIX COM. SKEWS ME -- WORKED WITH STAFF TO EXPAND THE THE RELIEF AVAILABLE UNDER. FORTY THREE TWENTY FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS [inaudible] AND ALTHOUGH. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO ELEVEN TWENTY NINE OF THOSE WILL BE CONSOLIDATED SUCH [inaudible] THEY ARE. ARE CONSTRUED RECONCILE WITH EACH OTHER -- EXISTING LAW AND BOTH FAMILY AND TOWARD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- THE ADDITIONAL RELIEF AB ELEVEN TWENTY NINE SIX TO CREATE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT UNINTENDED UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE ITS INTENT. IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED BY OTHER GROUPS LIKE SCUM WOULD LIKE TO RAISE THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF CONCERN. THE PENSION PROVISION WILL STATED BY THE BILL IS PROBLEMATIC AS DRAFTED IT CANNOT BE TAILORED TO ENSURE JUSTICE ON THE FACTS OF A PARTICULAR CASE THAT MAY NOT FALL INTO THE TYPICAL -- PATTERN THAT WE THAT WE USUALLY SEE. WHILE THE TYPICAL DB SCENARIO IS THE EXERCISE OF COURSE OF CONTROL BY THE DOMINANT PARTNER IS NOT THE ONLY POSSIBLE SCENARIO. THEY'RE RELATIVELY RARE BUT COMPELLING INSTANCES IN WHICH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT PART OF A PATTERN OF COURSE OF CONTROL BUT IT'S RATHER A ONE TIME OCCURRENCE. THIS IS NOT A SITUATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND IT'S EXISTENCE IS SUPPORTED BY SOLID SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH. ANYINSTANCE OF A VICTIM FINALLY RETALIATING AFTER YEARS OF IT OF ABUSE. IT WOULD BE JUST FOR THE COURT TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE JUDICIAL DISCRETION REGARDING DISTRIBUTION OF THE PENSION FUNDS. SOMETIMES THE PARTIES COMMIT ACTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST EACH OTHER -- I THINK ONE OF THE PHRASES USED ITS MITCHELL COMBATANTS. AND BOTH WERE FOUND TO BE AT FAULT. THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR WHAT OCCURS IN THIS INSTANCE. BUT UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THE EFFECT WOULD BE. THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS RELATIVELY FINANCIALLY DISADVANTAGED IT'S GOING TO REMAIN THAT WAY -- AND IN FACT IT WOULD BE EXACERBATED RELATIVE TO CURRENT LAW. FAMILIES YOU WRAP UP PLEASE. UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW IT CIVIL CODE SEVENTEEN OH EIGHT POINT -- SIX A PERSON WHO HAS SUFFERED ABUSE MAY FILE AN ACTION IN TORT. FLIX COM UM RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE IT SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE AT ITS HEART. THANK YOU VERY KINDLY FELIZ. THANK YOU OTHERS THAT OPPOSITION PLEASE. MORNING TEAR MEMBERS LARA SPEED WITH ADDITIONAL COUNSEL CALIFORNIA WHILE WE ARE LISTED IN OPPOSITION OR CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE LATEST PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND WE HOPE TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SAY NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR I I AM. 1000% IN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOAL. I JUST HAVE A KIND OF A TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT. THE LACK OF REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR FELONIES AND I SHOULD SAY BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I'VE HANDLED AS A PROSECUTOR AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IS THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY ON HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DB CASES THAT. AND MY WIFE PRACTICES FAMILY LAW SO WE SEE THE INTERSECTION INTERPLAY BETWEEN TWO THINGS MY FEAR IS. A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES PARTICULARLY WITH FELONS. AND DB CASES YOU GOT SOMEBODY THAT'S AN ABUSER AND IS MANIPULATIVE. NOW THAT'S NOT EVERY CASE OKAY BUT QUITE OFTEN THAT IS THE CASE. AND THEY CAN BE QUITE GOOD AND QUITE CRAFTY AT MANIPULATING A SYSTEM THAT IS -- TO TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE Y FEAR IF THERE'S NO JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN THE FELONY INSTANCE -- IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. DEFENDANTS IN THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM -- MANIPULATING THAT SYSTEM. TO TRY TO GAIN SOME SORT OF ADVANTAGE IN THE FAMILY LAW SYSTEM IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE THE ABILITY OF THE JUDGE. TO EVALUATE IT THEN AS A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHEN YOU'RE. ADVISING YOUR CLIENT. WHAT YOU'RE PUBLIC DEFENDER PRIVATE COUNSEL? OF THE CONSEQUENCES THE PLEA YOU'D BE. DUTY BOUND ADVISING THAT MIGHT HAVE. THE EFFECT OR WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF IT'S A FELONY IF THIS BECOMES LAW OF STRIPPING AWAY. ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO COMMUNITY PROPERTY IN RESPECT. TO WITH RESPECT THE PENSION AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT -- THAT IS COULD THAT COULD GIVE INCENTIVES PEOPLE WOULD PROLONG A CRIMINAL CASE THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE PROLONGED OR OFF FORCE IN ESSENCE A TRIAL PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE GETTING A FREE ATTORNEY. THE PUBLIC DEFENDER OF CIRCUMSTANCE. HIGH QUALITY OF COURSE. SCHOLAR BUT I MEAN IT COULD PROLONG THE RESOLUTION OF THAT CASE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE THE VICTIM. COME TO COURT AND BE FORCED TO TESTIFY AND I MEAN. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WATCHED THESE PEOPLE IN TEARS AT TIMES VIC ON THE VICTIMS SIDE. THE PROSPECT OF HAVING TO FACE. THEIR VIEWS ARE IN COURT AND THAT'S IT. THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT TAKES PROFOUND COURAGE. AND NOT EVERYBODY IS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY WANT. TO TO COME TO COURT SO. AB AGAIN A 1000% ONBOARD WITH A CALL BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON WIDE THERE'S NO REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. FOR THE FOR THE FELONY SICKENING WISH WELL THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION -- IN THROUGH THE CHAIR THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION Y. WE DON'T ALLOW THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THE FELONY. WE HAVE EXISTING LINE CALIFORNIA FROM SENATE BILL FIFTEEN TWENTY TWO BY. A SENATOR ATKINS WHICH ESTABLISHED A THE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION IN A FELONY CONVICTION SOMEBODY CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AS THEIR FORM OF DOMESTIC ABUSE OR ATTEMPTED MURDER. A WHAT THAT LEAVES IS WILL SAY A WOMAN SPOUSE WHO IS BEATEN CLOSE TO DEATH -- BUT THERE'S NOT A AN ALLEGATION OF ATTEMPTED MURDER -- POTENTIALLY FORFEITS -- PENSION RIGHTS COMMUNITY PROPERTY RIGHTS ETCETERA SO THE FELONY PART CONFORMS. IN ALL MEMBERS IN BOTH A FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR COMPONENTS. DUE PROCESS IS AFFORDED THE ACCUSED IN A CRIMINAL COURT THERE ARE THOSE IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMMUNITY WHO THINK SIMPLE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD RESULT IN THESE REMEDIES WE HAVE THE STANDARD OF A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. WHERE THE ACCUSED IS AFFORDED FULL DUE PROCESS WHETHER IT'S VALENTINIAN MISDEMEANOR THE OTHER PART OF YOUR QUESTION? ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT. PLEA BARGAINING OR PEOPLE PLAYING PLAYING THE SYSTEM AND AND THE CONCERN OF A VICTIM HAVING TO TESTIFY. IN COURT WELL. IF AN ACCUSER A IS CHARGE A IF AN ABUSE IN MP USER IS CHARGED. LIKELY A PROSECUTOR IS GOING TO WORK WITH THE VICTIM. YOUR TESTIMONY FROM THAT VICTIM BUT WE'RE TOLD FROM THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL. THAT. THEY SHOULDN'T PURSUE THIS BECAUSE THEY CAN PURSUE A REMEDY IN TORT BY PURSUING A CIVIL ACTION. AFTER THE ABUSE HAS TAKEN PLACE ARM AND THAT REQUIRES THEM TO COME BACK INTO COURT TO DEPOSITIONS LINK THE DEPOSITIONS SO THE ABUSE DOESN'T AND AND AND THE ONLY PLACE THAT IT CAN HAPPEN ISN'T NECESSARILY. IN THE CRIMINAL SETTING SO BY PROTECTING THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED. AND IN THE MISDEMEANOR ARENA ALLOWING FULL DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE TO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER HYPOTHETICAL WE'VE HEARD IS THAT THE THROWING OF THE VASE RETALIATION A VICTIM OF ABUSE -- LIKE MISS MARTIN FOR MANY YEARS. REACHES A BREAKING POINT THROWS A VASE AT THE LONG TERM ABUSER AND GETS CHARGED WITH A CRIME WELL SIMPLY THROWING A BASIS PRAY NOT GONNA BE CHARGED AS A FELONY -- IF IF IT WERE IT MIGHT BE PLAYED DOWN TO A MISDEMEANOR THE JUDGE RESERVES IN THIS BILL FULL DISCRETION TO REVIEW THAT HISTORY OF TWENTY YEARS OF ABUSE. TO REVIEW FACTS IN EVIDENCE OF A BREAKING POINT OF A VICTIM. AND THE FULL DISCRETION TOWARD SOME OR NONE. OF THE PENSIONER COMMUNITY PROPERTY A TO THE ABUSER OR NINE AND SO I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DEVELOPED. WITH RESPECT TO THE MISDEMEANOR IT PROTECTS FULL DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE TO TO LISTEN TO THESE. WHAT I THINK UPRIGHT UNIQUE EXAMPLES I RECOGNIZE THEY HAPPEN? BUT FRIENDS THE VAST MAJORITY OF VICTIMS OF ABUSE ARE WOMEN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF VICTIMS OF THAT ABUSE ARE FROM ABUSIVE HUSBANDS. IN THE CURRENT LAW. TEX THEM IN SHARING A THE EARNINGS THE PENSION OF THEIR VICTIM WERE TRYING TO CONFORM. TO LAW WHAT ALREADY EXISTS FOR THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT OR AN ATTEMPTED MURDER WE THINK IT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL VICTIMS WHERE THERE'S A FELONY CONVICTION SO I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES IT MAYBE NOT SATISFACTORILY BUT THAT WOULD BE MY RESPONSE. THANK YOU [inaudible] OUR WELL. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUILD OF MAN ISSUE THAT WE CONTINUALLY AND UNDERSTANDABLY. ARE OF PUTTING MORE MORE FOCUS ON THE MORE VERY REALIZING ABOUT ABUSE AND THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY OF THE NEW VICTIMS COMMON ALL WEALTH CLASSES ALL RACES YOU NAME IT. A SORT OF PERPETRATORS AND THAT THE THAT THERE IS BUDGET AND THAT'S NOT THAT I THINK WE'RE LEARNING A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT IN RECENT YEARS WHICH IS GOOD -- AND AND CERTAINLY I THINK -- THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE ARE MANY SITUATIONS AND SCENARIOS WHERE VICTIMS TO BE FINANCIAL HOSTAGES IN DIFFERENT FORMS IN THIS FORMAT COULD BE. DUBBED RISK OF LOSING THEIR THEIR PENSION AND RETIREMENT WHAT HAVE YOU. I'M. FOR MANY IMMIGRANTS I KNOW THAT WE SEE THIS LOT SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY OF THEY COME HERE -- THEY HAVE MARRIED INCOME HERE THEY DON'T KNOW ANYONE THEY DON'T HAVE AND AND AND A PILL HELPLESS TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT IF THEY'RE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ABANDONED UP AND SOUTHERN ALLOT A DIFFERENT. WEB FORMS THAT THIS KIND OF ABUSE TAKES SHAPE IN AND AND SO I I APPRECIATE OF MISS MARTIN AND OTHERS THAT WERE BILLION TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO SPEAK ABOUT IS VERY VULNERABLE. A POSITION IBM IS COURAGEOUS AND IT REMINDS ME OF OF WHEN I WAS AT A YOUNG ATTORNEY WAS IN CHAMBERS AND WAS OF A CASE ROUTE BUT LITTLE MOTIONAL BOWDEN. SORT OF CRIME. TO BEING HUMAN AND SO BOB PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THE MOTION USUALLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT COMES FROM A REAL PLACE AND IT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS. THAT WE'RE DOING LIES IN YOUR DOING YOU KNOW COME UP ON PAPER BLACK WHITE THAT WERE ACTUALLY TRYING OUR BEST TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DO BECAUSE AS WE ARE HEARING OTHER IS DUE PROCESS OUR RIGHTS THAT EVERYONE HAS UP THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND AND OF AS MUCH MY COLLEAGUE NAM. EYES WORK AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER W. DEFENDER FOR ELEVEN YEARS -- AND SO KNOW VERY WELL -- ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FAR MORE THAN THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM HOWEVER -- BY UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER FAMILY LIVES AND IT GETS VERY CONTENTIOUS AND I APPRECIATE. THE THE HONING AND AND THE FOCUS OF THE AMENDMENTS ON THE THAT THE MISDEMEANOR ASPECT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES MY UNDERSTANDING OF FAMILY COURT NO ACCUSATIONS ARE FLYING BACK AND FORTH I THINK. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT A COURT -- HAS THE DISCRETION -- TO IT YOU AS TO HOW IT APPLIES THE RULE WAS THAT AND IS IT UP THERE WITH THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AS APPLIES. TO MISDEMEANOR CHARGES I AND I DO. AS OFTENTIMES CASE HAS SOME SENSITIVITY TO THAT THOUGH REYES LEGISLATE TELLS US TO RESOURCES FOR THE COURTS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT -- THAT AND I KNOW OUR CHAIR AGREES THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. TUB OF DATA TO GET MORE RESOURCES FOR OUR COURTS IN GENERAL AND SO I THINK ABOUT. UP WHEN I HEAR THAT COMMON REFRAIN. I TAKE IT TO HEART BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOUBT WERE STILL MY IS EVEN WITH OUR BUDGET GETTING MORE RESOURCES TO OUR OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM THERE'S STILL MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO AND I THINK THAT EVERY TIME WE PUT. ON MORE -- OPPORTUNITIES. FOR MORE MORE MORE OCCASIONS WHERE -- COURT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MORE DISCRETION THAN CLEARLY THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ASK A I'D TO WORKLOAD. HOWEVER I I APPRECIATE JUST WHAT DISCRETION I KNOW THAT I'VE SAID THIS ON IN THE PAST MY COMES TO MANDATORY ENHANCEMENTS WHAT HAVE YOU. AND I'M. THAT THOUGH THE ONE THING I'LL MENTION IS THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT WITH THE FELONY CHARGES. BUT YES I COULD ADD ANOTHER ELEMENT -- I'M TO OF DEFENDANTS TO CONSIDER TO WAY. AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA PLEAD GUILTY OR NOT THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT ANYTIME YOU OUR THERE'S IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCE POTENTIAL TAMMY LA CONSEQUENCE BUT THERE'S HAS TO TRUST YOUR CHILDREN. EYES UP OF FORMER DEFENSE ARE THOSE ALL THINGS THAT WE WOULD. VERY SERIOUSLY ADVISE OUR CLIENTS ON AND THIS WOULD BE ONE MORE THING ON A FELONY CASE BUT AB TO SUGGEST THAT. THIS CONSEQUENCE ALONE WILL BE A DETERMINING FACTOR AS WHETHER THE GO TO TRIAL OR NOT. IS JUST NOT REALISTIC I'M I THINK THAT. IF SOMEONE'S FACING PRISON TIME IF THEY DON'T A TRIAL AND IF THEY ARE. GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID PRISON TIME FOR NOT GOING TO TRIAL I THINK THAT PROBABLY HAS A MUCH GREATER IMPACT ON THEIR DECISION AS TO WHETHER THEY PETER NOT AND AS OPPOSED TO FIGHTING IT ALL THE WAY. NOT SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE OCCASIONS WHERE GOING TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME OCCASIONS BUT IN THE BALANCE. HOW AM I DON'T? I'M I I DON'T SEE THAT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LEGITIMATE SERIOUS FELONY CASE I AM A THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR OFTENTIMES BENEATH ON THE CASES ARE REDUCED TO MISDEMEANOR WHEN THE FACTS COME OUT AND AND AND UP TO CLEVELAND. WHEN THERE'S A WOMAN BEING ACCUSED OF FELONY AND THEYARE A PART OF THE A A AND THEY'VE BEEN IN A VIOLATION FOR A LONG TIME AND IT'S DAMN? RESPONDING BACK -- OFTENTIMES THAT THE AT THE CRIMINAL COURT LEVEL. THOSE ISSUES WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND DOLBY CONSIDERATION AND OFTENTIMES THOSE CASES WILL BE REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR GIVEN. THE THAT THE THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COURTS AND FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAPPEN TO FURTHER DELVE INTO THE CASE. I'M I DON'T KNOW THE ONE THING JUST YOU KNOW A AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY IS. IS THE I KNOW THIS ISN'T IN SOME WAYS NOT DIRECTLY COLONEL HANSON BUT IT DOES ENHANCE PENALTIES FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES AND SO -- I THINK IN WEIGHING. IN AND WEIGHING EVERYTHING I STILL SUPPORT THE BILL EXACTING THAT THERE ARE STILL. A BROAD AYE AYE SO THAT THERE'S STILL A FAR MORE TO SUPPORT SHOULD NUMBER WOMEN -- WHO ARE? VICTIMS OF OF VIOLENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CRIMES. THAT ARE NOT -- GETTING BY OF THAT THEIR FAIR SHAKE ALL IN ALL IT IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOME OF CASES BOTH CRIMINALLY AND IN FAMILY LAW. ARE AND SO BUT I WOULD I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING IS. IF THIS WERE TO BECOME LAW -- PUT IT THE OTHER IN A IN A BATCH OF SUMMER FORGET ABOUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE TWO THREE YEARS DOWN THE LINE. WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE BECAUSE I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED INCLUDING WAYS BY OPPOSITION? UMMA AND I THINK IT'LL BE INCUMBENT UPON US TO RETURN. TO THE US TO SEE HOW BUT THE OUTCOMES ARE IN THE YEARS AHEAD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS THE DESIRED OUTCOME WHICH I KNOW SENATOR. UP YOUR INTENTIONS ARE 100% PURE AND GOOD IN CHINA PROTECT VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WITH THAT GOAL I I CERTAINLY SUPPORT IT [inaudible] THIS KILEY. A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- FOR THE OPPOSITION'S SO I'M. THAT PERVERSE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU OUT WARNER HAVE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT PLAY OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE FELONIES -- FOR WHICH THERE IS ALREADY A BAR ON AYE SPOUSAL ABUSE -- YOU KNOW AND IF NOT WHY WOULD THIS ADDITIONAL COSTS OF THEM FELONIES HAVE THOSE PERVERSE CONSEQUENCES. AND SAID SORRY AT SECOND QUESTION IS -- UNDER -- EXISTING LAWS YOU KNOW THE THE FAMILY LAW JUDGE CAN ALREADY CONSIDERING CRIMINAL HISTORY AND MAKING THE SPOUSAL ABUSE AWARD AND SO -- THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A ROOM IM XIN -- FOR MISDEMEANOR CASES SO OUT WHY DO YOU SEE -- THE ELEVATION OF THIS EVIDENCE BEING RELEVANT TO IT BECOMING A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION -- TO BE SUCH A STRONG -- FACTOR THAT WOULD THEN DRIVE -- THE DECISION WHETHER TO ACCEPT A PLEA BARGAIN ON THE PART OF DEFENDANT [inaudible] I I THINK THE SECOND QUESTION IF IF THAT'S OKAY -- WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING A LOT WHAT EXISTING LAW DOES IS GIVE THE JUDICIAL OFFICER THE DISCRETION TO TAKE. ANY DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BETWEEN THE PARTIES INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE AWARD OF SPOUSAL SUPPORT. AND ATTORNEY'S FEES BECAUSE THE ATTORNEYS FEES STATUTES. BUT DIRECT THE COURT TO LOOK AT THE SPELLS SPORTS STATUES WHAT IT COMES ABOUT BUT CREATING A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR UP FOR EXAMPLE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION. OVERCOMING OF A BY THE BOOK PRESUMPTION IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT -- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL YOU KNOW WOMAN WHO'S A STATE HOME MOM WHO DOESN'T HAVE HER OWN. PORT OR OR MONEY TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO OVERCOME THAT VERY BIG BURDEN. OF BOTH OF THAT PRESUMPTION. AND SHE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MOST LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT I THINK AS ATTORNEY AS A PRACTITIONER VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME OVER ABOUT ABOUT PRESUMPTION. VERSES THE CURRENT LAW WHICH ALLOWS THE COURT TO JUST TAKE EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDERATION AN EXERCISE OF DISCRETION WHICH WE THINK IS THE BETTER PART WHICH AND THEN THAT THE FIRST QUESTION AND I AT WITH RESPECT TO THE FELONIES THAT ARE ALREADY CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE TO CREATE THIS. SPARK -- WELL I HOPE THAT I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY I DON'T PRACTICE CRIMINAL LAW I PRACTICE ONLY. FAMILY LAW I CAN TALK TO ABOUT THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANDATORY -- THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS AS A RESULT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACTION AND HOW WOULD IMPACT MY CLIENTS. THEY ARE SCARED TO DEATH TO GO TO COURT. IT IS A STRUGGLE IT IS IT IS A CONTINUING STRUGGLE THAT REQUIRES THE SUPPORT OF EVERYONE AROUND THEM WHEN THEY HAVE GENUINELY BEEN VICTIMIZED. TWO TO GET THEM TO HANG AND THROUGH THE LITIGATION PROCESS TO GET THE PROTECTION THAT THEY NEED. AND I ALSO THINK THAT THIS -- IT IS BUT I REALIZED THAT IT'S A VERY HARD CALL BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS INCREASES RISK FOR THEM. BECAUSE WE'RE UPPING THE ANTE WITH RESPECT. TO THE ABUSER WERE GIVING HIM MORE TO BE ANGRY ABOUT AND AND WHICH IS NOT TO SAY. WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT. IN MANY CASES. IT'S NOT WELL DESERVED AYE I THINK FLEX COMES PROBLEMS WERE REALLY CENTERED AROUND THE PROCESS ISSUES -- THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT MONETIZING INJURY. THAT SHOULD BE OCCURRING IN TORT FAMILY LAW DOES NOT SAID -- AND TORE IT WE DON'T HAVE JURIES AND WE SUPPORTED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS EARLY ON AND THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. MAKING IT EASIER PATHWAY FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. TO GET INTO THE THE TORT SYSTEM TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED THERE. RATHER THAN HAVING THIS KIND OF BLANKET TREATMENT I UNDERSTAND EVERYONE'S CONCERNS REGARDING THIS I JUST HAVE GENUINE CONCERN FOR THE VICTIMS. WHEN THE ABUSERS FIND OUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SING NONE. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I APPRECIATE. THE TIME YOU'VE AFFORDED TO THIS AND I'M THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE CHALLENGES -- I WOULD SAY HOWEVER THAT. ON WE ESTABLISH A BAR THAT REQUIRES A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. THAT AFFORDS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS TO AN ALLEGED ABUSER. IT ALSO CAN INFORM A FAMILY COURT AS TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD THE HIGHEST STANDARD. IN TERMS OF DETERMINING GUILT INDIANS INNOCENTS WE'RE TOLD THAT THE NO FAULT SYSTEM IN FAMILY LAW IS SACROSANCT IN THIS WILL UPSET NO FAULT SYSTEM. FRIENDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SYSTEM WHERE SOMEBODY HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF FAULT IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING -- ATTEMPTED MURDER -- SEXUAL ASSAULT FELONIES CURRENTLY PROTECT THE VICTIM FROM THE ABUSER BENEFITING FINANCIALLY FROM THAT. THE QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER KILEY AYE DON'T THINK WAS WAS FULLY ANSWERED WE DON'T HAVE THAT I AM AWARE OF ANY DATA. OF HOW THAT'S ADVERSELY IMPACTED VICTIMS -- OUR HOPE IS THAT IT DOES ADVERSELY IMPACT A CONVICTED FELON WHO'S ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ATTEMPTED MURDER WE THINK THAT SAME STANDARD SHOULD APPLY TO ANYONE CONVICTED OF A FELONY. HOW THIS IMPACTS CRIMINAL COURTS IN PLEA BARGAINING A IT. PERHAPS WILL GIVE A PROSECUTOR SOME LEVERAGE TO SECURE -- A PLEA FOR A MISDEMEANOR SO THAT THE FOR THE THE PERSON ACCUSED OF A FELONY -- HAS AN OPTION TO APPEAL TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY BAD IN TERMS OF OPENING UP FOR PROTECTION IT'S WITH A MISDEMEANOR. PLEA -- IN A FELONY SITUATION BUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS LAW. IS NOT TO DICTATE HOW CRIMINAL DEFENSE FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FULFILLS IN THEIR JOB -- I DO THINK WOULD BE INCUMBENT ON THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO MAKE -- HIS OR HER CLIENT FULLY AWARE OF POTENTIAL FAMILY LAW IMPLICATIONS THEY ALREADY EXIST UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT. OR ATTEMPTED MURDER WE THINK IT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL FELONIES WE THINK THAT SUGGEST IT'S EQUITABLE. AND AT THE CORE OF THIS. ATTEMPTING PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN VICTIMS. OF LONG TERM ABUSE [inaudible] ASSAULT. ATTEMPTED MURDER AND EVEN MURDER AND IT IS HIGH TIME THAT CALIFORNIA A RECOGNIZES THAT AS WE HAVE WITH THE NARROW CLASS TO EXTEND THAT TO OTHER CLASSES OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I'D RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU. AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING CRAFT I THINK. VERY REASONABLE AMENDMENTS TO GREATER CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY IN THE MISDEMEANOR RINA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. THEY WILL TAKE THIS UP WAS TO GET A LOT THANK YOU THANK YOU. SENATE Y. KOWSKI. ALRIGHT SENATOR. LET'S. WE SHALL SEE SO SENATOR ALLEN YOU'RE FOR BILLS FOR TODAY NOW NOW NOW MY GUIDE NOW PLEASE. YOU'RE YOU'RE ONE BILL THIS IS HOW AND REYES IS ITEM NUMBER NINE S. B. TEN SIX THIS BILL HAS LITERALLY ENTIRE IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME BILLS WHEN IT STARTED AND HAS NOT RECEIVED A SINGLE NOVO IT WHEN IT THIRTY EIGHT ZERO VOTE IN THE STATE. SENATE. I SO THAT'S BECAUSE THE SENATE CZ ARE HIGH YES. ALRIGHT SO I JUST WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL FOR THEIR DETAILED ANALYSIS THIS BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CLIMATE. AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION GOALS BY LIMITING OBSTACLES THAT COULD PREVENT CONDOMINIUM RESIDENTS FROM ACCESSING ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS WHILE THE PRICE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HAS BEEN STEADILY DECREASING THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE. CONDOMINIUM RESIDENTS BELONG TO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS OFTEN FIND IT EVEN HARDER TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SINCE THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE CONVENIENCE [inaudible] STATION. SO CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS A HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION FROM UNREASONABLY RESTRICTING RESIDENTS ABILITY. TO INSTALL A CHARGING STATION AT THEIR OWN COST BUT IT'S SILENT REGARDING THE REMAINING NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE TIME OF USE METER. AT THAT MAKE DVDS MORE ECONOMICAL THIS BILL ADDRESSES THIS GAP IN LA BY PROHIBITING HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS FROM RESTRICTING THE ABILITY RESIDENTS TO INSTALL A TIME OF USE METER. AND THE COMPANY INFRASTRUCTURE I HAVE WITH ME COURT ABOLISHED FROM THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SUFFICIENT SPEAKING. SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I DO WANNA THINKS AS SENATOR MORE CASKEY FOR I'VE FOR BY ME PRESENT. THANK YOU THEIR WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KORABL OF SOME HALF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF SP. TEN SIXTEEN EARLIER THIS YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLING FOR TURNER FIFTY THOUSAND EVEN CHARGING STATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. BY TWENTY THIRTY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THESE ADMIRABLE GOALS AND THEY WILL REQUIRE A PRETTY MASSIVE SCALE UP IN INFRASTRUCTURE IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET THEM.

FOR A GENERALLY SEE GENEROUSLY SPENDING MANY HOURS ENDEAVORING TO MAKE THIS BILL EVEN BETTER I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS CONTAINED COMMITTEES MOCKUP THANK YOU I'M THE BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN CALIFORNIA IS. A FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY IS A STAFF REPORT PART. POINTS OUT SOME HOMEOWNERS SPORTS HAVE MANIPULATED ELECTIONS BY FAILING TO NOTICE AN ELECTION FAILING TO DELIVER THE BALLOTS ALL RESIDENTS AND THROWING OUT VALID BALLOTS SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN HOLD ELECTIONS AT ALL. THIS IS DONE TO EXCLUDE DISENFRANCHISE THE RESIDENTS WITH ME TODAY IS. MEMBERS WHO YOU HEARD FROM OUR MISTER ROBERTS K. SCR A PARIKSHIT FOR A TENTH. AND JUDGED OTHER THOMAS SIR. BUT RETIRED JUDGE THOMAS SIR AND I URGE AND I BOTH. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING. TO CHAIR MY NAME IS ERIC SHIVARAM ATTORNEY WITH THE LAW FIRM OF SHIVERINGBOOSTS IN ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA. OF A CERTIFIED POLA SPECIALIST I WAS COUNSEL OF RECORD IN THE WITTENBERG VERSES BEACH WHAT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. WHICH WAS -- BURSTON TOWARDS I'D ONLY PUBLISHED A OPINION ON ELECTIONS INVOLVING HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS. MY OFFICE IN -- REPRESENTS DISSENTING HOMEOWNERS IN SEVERAL MATTERS AND I WANTED HER TO MY SUPPORT -- FOR SENATOR WIECKOWSKI IS BILL I WANTED YOU IN PARTICULAR THE AMENDMENT THAT'S SET FORTH TO FIFTY ONE FORTY FIVE EIGHT WHICH IS PROVIDING A MEANINGFUL REMEDY FOLLOWING THE COURT'S DETERMINATION. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ELECTION -- VIOLATIONS FOUND -- AS THE LA NOW STANDS A COURT IS GIVEN DISCRETION TO AVOID RESULTS OF AN ELECTION EVEN AFTER VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN FOUND. AND IN THOSE INSTANCES IT KEEPS THE BURDEN ON THE DISSENTING MEMBER TO PROVE THAT THE ELECTION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO VIOLATE THE PROCEDURES. I'M WHETHER NOT THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED THE AMENDED THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED UNDER. FIFTY ONE FORTY FIVE EIGHT ACTUALLY SHIFT THAT BURDEN TO ASSOCIATIONS AND IT MAY COULD MANDATORY THAT IT SHALL BE. VOIDED UNLESS THE ASSOCIATION CAN SHOW THAT THE VIOLATIONS WERE A UNINTENDED IN NON CONSEQUENTIAL. AND I THINK THAT IS A MUCH FAIRER -- WAY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THE LIES WRITTEN I BELIEVE HAS NO TEETH AND I URGE THAT AMENDMENT TO PASS -- AND JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE THE PROVISION IS ENTITLED THE JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF ELECTION PROCEDURES. AND WOOD BURKE DECISION SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT WHILE VIOLATIONS MAY BE RELEVANT ESSENTIALLY ITS HANDS WERE TIED BECAUSE DISCRETION AS WITH THE COURTS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO AVOID IT I THINK. VIOLATIONS -- SHOULD BE MORE THAN RELEVANT THEY SHOULD CARRY THE DAY I THINK THE OPINION. WHAT SORT OF THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG BUT AS TO THAT POINTSO I BELIEVE THAT IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT THE ASSOCIATION SHOULD BEAR THAT BURDEN? THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO SHOW BY A PREPONDERANCE THAT THE VIOLATIONS. BUT THE VIOLATIONS WERE IN FACT UNINTENTIONAL AND NON CONSERVE QUITE CHILL I BELIEVE TWELVE SIXTY FIVE DOES JUST THAT AN EDITOR CHEN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE -- TIME SIR ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK OF COMMITTEE STAFF THAT'S BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT. AND DEFERRED TO OUR NEXT WITNESS AT KEVIN BAKER FROM THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA. I CAN STATURE AWARENESS KEVIN DIFFER FROM THEIR CONSERVE LIBERTIES UNION I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. UP WE ARE OFTEN -- COLE DIDN'T ON ISSUES RELUCTANT REGARDING. ELECTIONS IN THESE -- HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE I GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR OF THEIR SCOPE AND THEIR AUTHORITY OVER HOMEOWNERS. AND AND OR OR OR ALL RESIDENTS INCLUDING TENETS NAM WE BELIEVE THAT THAT. EFFORTS BY MR MAJKOWSKI WITH ALAN AND THAT BUT BY THE COMMITTEE TO REFINE THE BILL ANWAR HELPFUL STEP INTO ME TO PREVENT PROBLEMS AND HAVE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AND ITS ASSOCIATES. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION DON'T YOU. CLEAR THE TABLE FOR THE OPPOSITION. SORRY I MEANT SUPPORT DIDN'T GET IT FAST YOU OKAY. WILL REDUCE YOUR SUPPORT JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR FOR LARGEST RAINY AND I AM ON A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION BOARD. AND I THINK THIS WILL BENEFIT THE ENTIRE ASSOCIATIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] OPPOSITION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF OUR KNOW AND HE TAKE UP HALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS AND I'M FOR DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES WITH US ON THIS BILL. AND WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE COPYING OF THE BALLOTS AND OF THE SIGNATURE ENVELOPES THAT WAS A HUGE PRIVACY ISSUE FOR US. EVEN WITHOUT AMENDMENT THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE TO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE LIMITATIONS THAT THIS BILL PLACES ON THE QUALIFICATIONS OF WHO CAN BE ON THE BOARD -- WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WORK FOR SOME LIMITATIONS ON WHO CAN RUN FOR THE BOARD BUT WE DO THINK THAT THE BOARDS AND THE MEMBERS OF THESE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS. SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME DISCRETION SHOULD OTHER ISSUES ARISE -- WE HAD DISCUSSED -- AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR FUTURE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE BY LAWS SO THAT WAS IT WAS A VOTE OF THE ENTIRE. HOMEOWNERS IT ASSOCIATION WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHOR TO STILL CONTINUE -- POSSIBLY PROVIDING THAT DISCUSSION FOR BOARD MEMBERS -- FEATHER ISSUES ARISE WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THE QUALIFICATIONS DOES ADDRESS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT UP TO DATE ON REGULAR ASSESSMENTS BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS -- IF A MEMBER IS NOT PAYING THEIR SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS THE REST OF THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE TO PICK UP THAT TAB. AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEONE RUNNING FOR THE BOARD AND BEING ON THE BOARD WHEN THEY'RE ALSO NOT PAYING THEIR SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS -- WE FURTHER HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE SHIFTING OF THE BURDEN. I'M WE BELIEVE THAT IF A MEMBER BELIEVES THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE ELECTION THAT SOMETHING WAS DONE UNFAIRLY. AMAR THAT PROCEDURE WASN'T FOLLOWED THEY SHOULD HAVE THE BURDEN TO PROVE. THAT -- THAT THAT WAS THE CASE AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ON THE ASSOCIATION TO HAVE TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S AN ODD SHIFT TO HAVE THEM PROVING A NEGATIVE -- OTHER THAN THAT WE JUST HAVE OTHER CONCERNS WITH -- THINGS THAT MAY RAISE THE COST TO HOMEOWNERS CERTAINLY ACTION PROCEDURES ON THE PAYING OF AN ATTORNEY CONSULTATION FEE -- AND WHILE WE SUPPORT FAIR ELECTIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO WRONGDOING WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT UNDUE BURDENS AND I DO COSTS ARE NOT PLACED ON THE HOMEOWNERS FOR SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE JUROR NO VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S BEEN SWEAT LODGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYWHERE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SINGLE BRING ABOUT THE COMMITTEE. COMMENTS I MADE EARLIER ON CENTER RAS BILL. NOT TO GO INTO ALL THAT DETAIL BUT THIS WAS CAREFULLY CRAFTED. THE BETWEEN THIS BILL AND CENTER RAS BILL MOVING TO BILLS PART OF SUCH A THE SUBJECT THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER. THE SAME BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL HOW THAT'S DONE. SO WE ARE NOT EXPECTING THAT WHAT WE HAVE CHANGED IN THIS BILL OR SENATE ROTH BILL IS GOING TO CHANGE IF IT DOES WILL. CERTAINLY BRING IT BACK AND AND RECONSIDER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO IT. SO I'D APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH US AND BEING ABLE TO AS BEST WE CAN. HARMONIZE THESE TWO BILLS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR ELECTIONS THAT ARE. FAIR EFFICIENT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AND I I DO AGREE THAT. EVEN THOUGH THESE TEND TO BE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON WITH MUNICIPALITIES MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATIONS SO WE WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE ENSURE THAT ELECTIONS HOW INTER HOW ELECTIONS HAPPENED AND THAT THEY ARE. THEY THEY ARE FREE AND NOT WASTE TO A NECESSARILY EXCLUDE.

TWO TO FOUR IMMENSELY UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT TO ADD INVESTOR ELECTED OFFICIAL LOBBYIST DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER. TO THE LIST OF EXAMPLES OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE COVERED UNDER SECTION FIFTY ONE POINT.

IMPORTANTLY IS ISSUES HAVE EMERGED WE HAVE CONTINUED TO CRAFTING CONSIDER LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS EXISTING WEAKNESSES IN OUR LAW. IN TODAY'S AUTHORS AMENDMENTS WERE MOVING FOR FORWARD WITH ANTI RETALIATION LANGUAGE. TRULY AN ADEQUATELY PROTECT THOSE WHO DO INDEED COME FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY WERE INCLUDING LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS INSTANCES WHEN PERPETRATORS MISREPRESENT THEIR PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO COERCE AND ABUSE VICTIMS FOR EXAMPLE IF THE DEFENDANT IS AN INVESTOR.

ESTABLISH A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM OR HIS COLLEAGUES. JOINING ME THIS MORNING IS PAMELA GUEST AN ACTRESS WHO HAS BEEN BATTLING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT IN HOLLYWOOD. FOR FORTY YEARS BY SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HER OWN RAPE AT THE HANDS OF A SINGER SONGWRITER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES. WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER AND TO BE CLEAR THEIR NUMBER OF PROPOSED AUTHORS AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THAT IS SO THAT WAS YOU'VE REFERRED THOSE YES YOU'RE TAKING. THANK YOU. FOR STUDENTS PLACE GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS PAMELA GUEST I'VE WORKED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AS AN ACTRESS. A CASTING DIRECTOR AND CASTING EXECUTIVE AND AM NOW AN AWARD WINNING WINNING FILMMAKER. I CURRENTLY SIT ON THE NATIONAL IN LOS ANGELES BOARDS OF SAG AFTRA THE LARGEST UNION OF PERFORMERS IN THE WORLD WHICH WAS HAS WRITTEN TO YOU IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO TO FOUR I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE MY STORY WITH YOU. IN THE HOPES THAT IT WILL HELP ILLUMINATE Y. LEGISLATION LIKE S. B. TWO TO FORT PROTECT PROTECT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND ASSAULT IS SO IMPORTANT. GROWING UP IN RURAL OHIO I ALWAYS DREAMED OF BEING A GLAMOROUS ACTRESS. AS A FIRST STEP I WAS GIVEN A SCHOLARSHIP TO ATTEND A TOP UNIVERSITY AND WHILE THERE WAS ACTIVE IN EVERYTHING FROM GOVERNING THE COLLEGE TO PERFORMING IN THEATER AND FILM. AND EVEN STARTING MY OWN THEATRE COMPANY. A DRAMA MAJOR AND A DANCE MINOR I DANCED EVERYDAY JOYFULLY EXPRESSING MYSELF. DURING MY SENIOR YEAR IN COLLEGE WHEN I WAS JUST TWENTY ONE I CAME ACROSS A NOTICE ON A SCHOOL BULLETIN BOARD THAT THE DIRECTOR OF A FEATURE FILM WAS IN TOWN. TO AUDITION COMEDIC ACTRESSES MY SPECIALTY. MY HANDS SHOOK AS I CALLED THE NUMBER FROM THE PAY PHONE IN MY DORM HALLWAY. I JUST KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING HOLLYWOOD ASPIRATIONS I WAS SO EXCITED. A FRIENDLY WOMAN ON THE PHONE INSTRUCTED ME TO DRIVE TO REMOTE TOWNHOUSE OUTSIDE CAMPUS WHICH I DID THE NEXT DAY. SHE GREETED ME AT THE FRONT DOOR THEN QUICKLY LEFT AFTER SHE RELIEVED ME OF MY JACKET AND CURSE STOWING THEM SOMEWHERE I TO MY SITE AND LEAVING ME ALONE WAITING FOR THE DIRECTOR. HE USHERED ME INTO A SMALL ROOM UPSTAIRS THE CONTAINED A CAMERA. ON A TRIPOD AND THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR. THERE WERE A LOT OF MATTRESSES ON THE FLOOR IN THE SEVENTIES SO I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. HE BRAGGED ABOUT HIS SUCCESS IN NEW YORK IS A JINGLE WRITER FOR COMMERCIALS AND ASKED ME TO READ A SCENE FROM THE DOG EARED SCRIPT HE HANDED ME WHILE HE FILMED MY AUDITION FROM BEHIND THE CAMERA. HE THEN ASKED ME TO REMOVE MY GLASSES BECAUSE HE SAID THEY WERE CAUSING A GLARE. I COULD STILL READ BUT EXTREMELY BUT BEING EXTREMELY NEARSIGHTED EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM INCLUDING HIM WAS FUZZY AND INDISTINCT. I GAVE THE SAME MY ALL AND HE TOLD ME I'VE GOT IT. AND THEN HE ASKED ME TO TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES FOR THE LOVE SCENE THAT WAS NEXT. TO PROVE MY PROFESSIONALISM. I MEEKLY ARGUED WITH HIM A LITTLE BUT I WANTED TO PROVE THAT I COULD BE A PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS WHO TO THE DEMANDS OF THE ROLE SERIOUSLY. AND WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM ON SET LOOKING BACK MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUS BUT I TRUSTED HIS EXPERIENCE AND SUCCESS HAVING NO ADDITION ING EXPERIENCE MYSELF IN THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD. I RELUCTANTLY TOOK MY CLOTHES OFF. AND HE PUT THEM SOMEWHERE I COULDN'T SEE. I CONTINUED READING FROM THE SCRIPT. THEN I HEARD THE DISTINCT SOUND OF HIS ZIPPER BEING UNDONE AND SAW THROUGH THE FOG OF MY BAD EYESIGHT HIM ADVANCING TOWARDS ME. HE PINNED ME DOWN ON THE MATTRESS AND I FROZE FEELING COMPLETELY ALONE AND TERRIFIED. I SOBBED HYSTERICALLY AS HE RAPED ME. AFTERWARDS HE COULD UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS SO UPSET TELLING ME THAT I'D DONE A GREAT JOB AND I WAS A STRONG CONTENDER TO WIN THE ROLE. WELL I WAS ALTERED MY WORLD COMPLETELY SHATTERED. FEAR AND DISTRUST OF LIFE ITSELF BECAME EMBEDDED INTO MY VERY SOUL. I BLAME MYSELF FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE TO ME THINKING THAT IT WAS MY FAULT. I KILLED MY THREE BEST FRIENDS AND NO ONE ELSE. FOR YEARS I REPRESS THE EXPERIENCE BUT IT HAD UNDENIABLE AFFECTS ON MY CAREER AND PERSONAL LIFE. I STOP DANCING WITHOUT KNOWING IT I FELL APART IN AUDITIONS BUT I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MYSELF FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME I NEVER GAVE UP ON MY DREAM OF BEING AN ACTRESS BUT I COULD ONLY HALF HEARTEDLY PURSUED IT. I WAS SO AFRAID YEARS OF TRAINING AND EFFORT WERE UNDERMINED BY THIS ONE EVENT. I ULTIMATELY CONTINUED ON IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AS A CASTING DIRECTOR. FINDING SAFETY AND A PURPOSE BEHIND MY DESK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I CAME ACROSS AN ARTICLE. ABOUT AN OSCAR WINNING SONG WRITER AND DIRECTOR WOULD KILL HIMSELF WHILE AWAITING TRIAL FOR RAPING YOUNG ACTRESSES AT PHONING AUDITIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. LIKE A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO DEVELOPING I BEGAN TO SEE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE MAN'S METHODS AND THOSE OF THE MAN WHO RAPED ME. WHEN I SAW HIS PHOTO A VIOLENT PHYSICAL REACTION COURSE THROUGH MY BODY ALMOST FORTY YEARS LATER? I KNEW I WAS LOOKING AT THE FACE OF MY RAPIST. AFTER LEARNING WHO HE REALLY WAS A SERIAL RAPIST I WAS RELEASED RELEASED FROM MY SELF IMPOSED PRISON OF SHAME. I FINALLY REALIZE THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME WAS NOT MY FAULT. BUT I ALSO FELT IMMEASURABLY SAD FOR HIS DOZENS OF OTHER VICTIMS AN ANGRY THAT HE WAS NEVER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. SO I BEGAN TO SPEAK OUT GOT MY LIFE AND RIGHTFUL CAREER BACK. MY STORY TRAGICALLY IS NOT UNIQUE OR UNCOMMON IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OR IN NEARLY ANY INDUSTRY. ACROSS FIELDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE THEY ARE THERE TO MENTOR HELP AND ENCOURAGE IN THEIR CAREERS. THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUSTING AND VULNERABLE LIKE I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES. THESE PREDATORS MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND NO LONGER ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR X. POTATO BEHAVIOR UNCHALLENGED LIKE MY ATTACKER WAS ABLE TO DO. I AM HONORED TO BE ABLE TO USED. MY PLATFORM TO SPEAK UP FOR MYSELF AND OTHER VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE AND IF YOU LIMIT YOURSELF TO A COUPLE MINUTES AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER AND I'M SENIOR COUNSEL FOR WORKPLACE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. WERE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR S. B. TWO TO FOUR FOR TOO LONG AND TOO MANY INDUSTRIES THE EXISTENCE OF UNEQUAL POWER DYNAMICS IN CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS HAVE ALLOWED SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF VIOLENCE TO RUN RAMPANT AND CHECKED. YOU'VE HEARD EXPLICITLY HOW THIS IS ACCORDING HOLLYWOOD IN HERE FROM WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW DIRECTORS AND PRODUCERS AND EXECUTIVES USE THEIR THEIR POWER TO OUT TO FORCE WOMEN AND OTHERS TO TO SUCCUMB TO SEXUAL ADVANCES. IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND SILICON VALLEY ALSO YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS SEEK FUNDING FOR THEIR COMPANIES FROM OLDER MORE EXPERIENCED AND ALMOST ALWAYS MAIL VENTURE CAPITALISTS INVESTORS. YOUNG WOMEN IN THIS POSITION ARE OFTEN SEXY PROPOSITION HARASSED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BUT ON IT ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO SPEAK UP OR FIGHT BACK BECAUSE THEIR HARASSERS ARE THE GATEKEEPERS THEIR SUCCESS. ONE FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR WHO WAS REPEATEDLY GROPED AND KISSED BY AN INVESTOR IN HER START UP COMMENTED OF OF HIS BEHAVIOR QUOTE I FELT LIKE I HAD TO TOLERATE IT BECAUSE THIS IS THE COST OF BEING A NON WHITE FEMALE FOUNDER. THESE WOMEN DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THAT THEIR ABUSERS ACCOUNTABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO SACRIFICE THEIR CAREER AMBITIONS. OF COURSE WE SEEN THIS PHENOMENON SACRAMENTO AS WELL WE SEEN IMPORTANT PROGRESS ON THIS FRONT IN WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS BILL THE NEXT IMPORTANT STEP TO CLARIFY THAT THESE THAT HARASSMENT WITHIN THESE PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS IS UNLAWFUL AND TO CLARIFY THAT THE VICTIM DOES NOT NEED TO SHOW THAT SHE COULD HAVE. EASILY TERMINATED THE RELATIONSHIP WE DON'T PUT -- TO STOP THIS KIND OF UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND MERGER AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU.

TO IT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING SO PERSONAL AND SO TRAGIC AND IN SO MANY WAYS. I THINK THAT AS WAS MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN AWAKENING A CHANGE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT -- WHETHER IT'S IN HOLLYWOOD -- OR WHETHER IT'S AN INTERN IN THE CAPITAL OR ITS IN TECH OR IT'S A JANITOR OR A HOTEL WORKER. WE'RE SEEING TIME AND AGAIN -- HOW FOR DECADES I'M AND FROM THE FOR THE MOST PART WOMEN IN SOME CASES MEN -- HAVE HAD JUST BEEN SHUT DOWN AND HAVE FELT LIKE THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO.

ARM THAT TO A MAN HAVE JUST AS MUCH RESPONSIBILITY. THAT NOT MORE IN SOME CASES OF AND IN THIS CULTURE. UP BUT I THINK THAT DUBBED THE LEGISLATION IS SO NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THAT THE MARKET. LICCARDO SOME BUT IT IS THE MARKET OR THE INDUSTRY SO WHETHER IT'S TECH WHETHER IT'S HOLLYWOOD WHETHER IT'S THAT. THE POLITICAL. COMPANY. BUT I'M ESTABLISHMENT AB THEY'RE NOT FIXING IT ON THEIR OWN AND AND SO IT TAKES THE COURAGE OF THOSE A STEP FORWARD TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

AND THIS POWER IMBALANCE HAS BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF A PARTICULARLY WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE NAIVE WHO ARE IN EXPERIENCED -- WHO ARE AFRAID? OF AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS KIND OF DEHUMANIZING AND HUMILIATING BEHAVIOR HAS GOT TO STOP. AND IT HAS TO STOP WITH THE PERPETRATORS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT ADDS TO AN EXISTING THE CHIP UNDER A CIVIL RIGHTS ACT HAS BEEN IN LAW FOR DECADES. IT IS TIME WE STEP UP HERE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY I AS A LEGISLATOR A LEGISLATURE.

THESE ILLEGAL CONVERSIONS ARE HARMING CALIFORNIA'S PRISTINE PORCELAIN WHICH DAMAGES IMPORTANT HABITAT ARE RESTRAINED BY WILDFIRES INSURANCE CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST CARBON SINKS. AND YOU'LL SEE MEMBERS SAT TO MY LEFT EYE IN THE BACK BY IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL. A LEGAL CONVERSION YOU WILL HAVE A STREAM THAT IS DIVERTED -- TREES THAT ARE ARE CLEARED WITHOUT PERMIT AYE IN A LEGAL STRUCTURES ALSO PUT UP. THE FORCE PRACTICE ACT WAS ENACTED NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE TO ENSURE THAT LOGGING IS DONE IN A MANNER THAT WILL PRESERVE AND PROTECT. FISH WILDLIFE FORCE INSTREAM BROADBAND SING TIMBER CUTS IN CALIFORNIA'S FORCED. THE TIMBER INDUSTRY IS COMPLY WITH THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS BUT NOW ARE FOR SPACE A NEW THREAT ROW CANNABIS GROWS A IN THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ACT. CAL FIRE HAS BEEN DEALING WITH A SHARP INCREASE IN FORCE TO PRACTICE ACT VIOLATIONS FROM ILLEGAL CONVERSION OF TIMBERLANE FOR CANNABIS CULTIVATION OPERATIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND IN ORDER FOR CAL FIRE TO INVESTIGATE WELL CANNABIS GROWS COMPLETELY AREN'T SP FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE EXTENSIVE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR ILLEGAL CONVERSIONS. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS THE CAUSE OF ACTION TO OCCUR UPON DISCOVERY OF THE VIOLATION VERSES THAT THE CONVERT WIN THE CONVERSION TAKES PLACE. A CRITICAL CHANGE THAT WILL ASSIST IN PROSECUTING THESE OFFENSES. AT THE CURRENT STATUTE LIMITATIONS TRULY MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR CAL FIRE INSPECTORS TO BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS INVESTIGATED PREPARE REPORT. AND THEN REFERRED THE MATTER TO A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SO THAT THE CIVIL ACTION CONNECT TO BE FILED IN TIME AND RIGHT NOW IT'S CURRENTLY WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH WINDOW.

REFER THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE PROSECUTING ENTITY THAT ONE YEAR STATUTE LIMITATIONS ACTS AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE SUCCESSFUL INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF THE SPECIFIC FORCE PRACTICE ACTS BY WHAT VIOLATIONS -- THIS BILL REALLY ALIGNS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THESE OFFENSES WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL OFFENSES THAT WE OFTEN SEE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THESE ARE ILLEGAL GROWS. BETTER BE WATER QUALITY CONTROL ACT VIOLATIONS -- ILLEGAL WATER DIVERSION WATER POLLUTION STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS THAT ARE ALSO THREE YEARS AND A CREW FROM. THE TIME THAT THE VIOLATIONS DISCOVERED SOME IN SOME CASES THIS WILL WHERE YOU HAVE ANILLEGAL -- TIMBERLAND CONVERSION ALONG WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER -- VIOLATIONS IT ALLOWS TO PURSUE ALL OF CHARGED VIOLATIONS AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO INSTANCES WHERE IT IS JUSTIN ILLEGAL TIMBERLAND CONVERSION.

JUDICIAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT HAS VERY LITTLE SUPPORT THEY DON'T GIVE PELUK GOT DIVISIONS THEY DON'T WORK ON CAMPAIGNS EXCEPT FOR THEIR CAMPAIGN TO BE JUDGES. AND YET IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE BEEN THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT AND PROVIDING JUSTICE TO FOLKS WHETHER IT'S ON TRAFFIC TICKETS OR BAIL OR EXPLODED TRIALS. AND SEWER DOING IN THIS BILL AS PART OF ONE STEP IN THE LONG MARCH OF JUSTICE. IS TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE A LOT A DOE IN THEIR POCKET TO TRY CASES AND SO WE'RE MOVING UP FROM TWENTY FIVE GRAND THE FIFTY GRAND. THIS PROCESS OF EXPEDITED TRIALS. WE'VE COMMITTED DO WITH THE EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE WHICH WE TRY TO FORGET A SOLUTION I KNOW THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING WELL THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DISCOVERY. IN IN IN THE NEXT WITH A TRIAL BUT IGOR COURT NECESSARY YOUR HONOR I NEED MORE TIME FOR WITNESSES WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT YOU KNOW THE MAIN.

ANYWHERE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS RUSS% BUCKLEY WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION WITH EFFECTIVELY OPPOSE SB TEN TWELVE CURRENTLY THE LIMITS CIVIL CASE ARE USEFUL TOOL FOR OUR COURT SYSTEM TO EFFICIENTLY HANDLE CASES. THE RISE ABOVE A SMALL CLAIMS COURT BUTFALL BELOW THE UNLIMITED CIVIL CASES. BY DOUBLING THE JURISDICTIONAL THRESHOLD. BOB THE BILL WOULD LIMIT THE FENCE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DISCOVER AND DEFEND A LAWSUIT. WE BELIEVE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DISCOVERY FOR A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR CASE WHICH IS NOT MAKES AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. AB PERFECTLY WHEN LIABILITIES THAT DISPUTE. WHAT TURN HE CAN BRING A MOTION FOR ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY? THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THIS MORE FREQUENT OCCURRENCE AN OPENLY CREATE ADDITIONAL WORK EXPENSES FOR THE COURTS AND PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE LAWSUIT. THE CHURCH IS YOU HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS EXPANSION ALSO IN THE FOLLOWING OF MORE COMPLEX MATTERS IN QUARTS OF LIMITS CIVIL JURISDICTION. WITH THE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES COVER THE FACTS OF THE CASE. INTERLUDE FOR WILL BE HINDERED FROM FOR OUR LEGAL DUTY FRANK A LEGAL DEFENSE FOR POLICY HOLDERS THANK YOU. I GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN IS THAT THE COMMITTEE KATE MICHELMAN CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- AS WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE OTHERS OFFICE WERE NOT I NECESSARILY OPPOSED THE CONCEPT OF RAISING THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT FOR A LIMITED JURISDICTION CASES. OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN THIS BILL WHICH IS TO DO AN OVERNIGHT INCREASED TO FIFTY THOUSAND FROM. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SO WE ASK FOR WE THOUGHT WAS A REASONABLE IT -- AMENDMENT TO DO A TWO STEP INCREASE SO RATE IT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A OUT RIGHT AWAY AND THEN MONITOR THAT FOR THREE TO FOUR YEARS SEE WHAT THE EFFECT ON NOT IS. IS MORE DISCOVERY WARRANTED AND OF SO INCREASED AGAIN TO THE FIFTY THOUSAND OTHER RESPONSE WE GOT BACK FROM THE AUTHORS OFFICE WAS THAT THAT WOULD BE COMPLEX AND COMPLICATED FOR CASES THAT ARE PENDING. BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF QUE CAPTION COURTS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THIS AMENDMENT WAS TAKEN. A OR IF THE SUB BILL WHAT'S TAKEN UP. UP OUR MAIN CONCERN HOWEVER IS WITH WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THE AUTHOR'S COMMITMENT. TO OVERTURN AYE SHAMUS WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH WITH UNANIMOUS IN SAYING THAT IF. AND WHAT ABOUT THAT CASE SAYS IS THAT IF I PLAINTIFF MISS PLEADS THE CASE. AND IT'S A CASE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN LIMITED JURISDICTION BUT WAS INSTEAD BROUGHT IN UNLIMITED JURISDICTION THAT THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION. TO DENY ATTORNEY'S FEE AWARD SO THAT PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE BROUGHT A DISCRIMINATION MATTER UNDER FEE HA. UP BROUGHT IT IN UNLIMITED JURISDICTIONS OVER. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THE JURY AWARDED HIM ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED I BELIEVE AND THEN HE BROUGHT ATTORNEY FEE AWARD FOR NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID YOU KNOW THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION TO DENY THAT IF YOU MUST PUT THE CASE SO WERE VERY CONCERNED. WITH THE ISLAND NOT AMENDMENT IF IT WERE TO TAKE PLACE IT WOULD BE A POST THINK IF. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

CHIU HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN REYES. GONZALEZ FLETCHER CONSULTS WHICH I THAT CURRENT VOTERS FOR TO ONCE WILL PUT THAT ALONG CALL THANK YOU. SENATOR LARA WELCOME. YOU HAVE TO BILLS BEFORE US ITEM NUMBER TWO S. B. ONE SEVENTY FOUR AND ITEM NUMBER THREE SB. ONE EIGHTY THREE COVER PREFERENCE -- WE CONCERT WITH ONE THIRTY FOUR FEET OF OKAY I'M NEVER TO SP. ONE SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AGAIN I DON'T THINK FIRST OF ALL YOUR STUFF ON BOTH THESE MEASURES THEY'VE BEEN ARE VERY VERY HELPFUL I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. HAS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED S. B. ONCE ONLY FOR SIX TO MAKE. KEY CHANGES AND KEY CODE SECTIONS THAT HAVE MADE HAVE BEEN IN OUR BOOKS FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AND REQUIRE CRITICAL REVISION SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REVISES. AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION IN THE STATE DEFINITION OF CITIZEN OF THE STATE IN ORDER TO INCLUDE THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS WERE BORN IN THE STATE AND EXPAND ACCESS. TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ACROSS THE STATE TO OUR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP OR IMMIGRATION STATUS. UNDER CURRENT LAW CITIZEN OF THE STATE IS DEFINED AS ANYONE BORN IN THE STATE EXCEPT FOR CHILDREN OF TRANSIENT ALIENS THAT IT'S CURRENTLY IN OUR CODES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TEMPTED TO DENY THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS THAT BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN THE STATE IMPLEMENTED THIS PROVISION HOWEVER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. WHICH WAS RATIFIED GRANTS BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP TO ALL PEOPLE BORN IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT THE SUPREME COURT RULED ON THIS MATTER WHEN CALIFORNIA CITIZEN BY THE NAME OF WONG KIM ARK. FOUGHT THAT CHINA AND THE MAD AT BIRTH RIGHT CITIZENSHIP EVEN THOUGH HIS PARENTS WERE CHINESE IMMIGRANTS. THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN HIS FAVOR AND STATED THAT NEITHER CONGRESS NOR ANY STATE COULD DENY BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP TO ANY CHILD OF AN IMMIGRANT BORN IN THE U. S.. THIS BILL SIMPLY STATES THAT CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE BORN IN THE STATE ARE CITIZENS OF THE STATE IN LINE WITH THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND MULTIPLE COURT RULINGS. THE SAME TIME THAT THIS DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE WAS BEING ENACTED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PASSED RESTRICTIONS ON WHO COULD SERVE ON APPOINTED SEVERAL OFFICES. APPOINTED HAVE OFFICES INCLUDE NUMEROUS STATE AND LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ACROSS OUR STATE. THIS INCLUDES OFFICES SUCH AS A MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA FIRST FLAT OUT FIRST FIVE CHILDREN FAMILIES COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. SP ONE SEVENTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS INCLUDING A DOCUMENT IMMIGRANTS TO BE APPOINTED. TO ANSWER OF ON THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THE BILL HAS BROAD IN ALLOWING ALL IMMIGRANTS TO SERVE IT ALSO DIFFERS A FEDERAL LAW REGARDING PAID WORK FOR EXAMPLE IF AN IMMIGRANT DOES NOT HAVE A WORK AUTHORIZATION THEN UNDER THIS BILL THAT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SERVE. IN AN APPOINTED CIVIL OFFICE THAT HAS A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ARE VERY HAVE VERY STRICT REQUIREMENTS TO SERVE INCLUDING OBTAINING SURPASS CERTAIN LICENSES AND UNDERGOING BACKGROUND CHECKS. THE PEOPLE WOULD STILL NEED TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE ON THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND ULTIMATELY STILL BE SELECTED TO SERVE. BY THE APPOINTING AGENCY OR INDIVIDUAL A AS YOU KNOW MANY IMMIGRANTS ARE HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND WOULD LIKE TO DOUBLE TO SERVE THE STATE BUT ARE BARRED CALIFORNIA'S MOST IMMIGRANT WHICH STATE WITH A POPULATION OF ABOUT TEN MILLION. IMMIGRANTS INCLUDING OVER TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU ARE MY NAME IS CARTHA CHRONIC CHRISTIAN. I'M A PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU. TO PROVIDE EXPERT TESTIMONY WITH RESPECT TO SP ONE SEVENTY FOUR ALSO KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA INCLUSION ACT INTRODUCED BY SENATOR LARA AND PRINCIPLE COAUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO. I SPEAK TODAY IS A PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY WHOSE LIFE'S WORK SEEKS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR POLICIES ARE INFORMED BY GOOD THEORY AND EVIDENCE. HAVE TWO DECADES OF RESEARCH EXPERIENCE ON IMMIGRANT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IMMIGRATION LAW AND POLICY. I'VE WRITTEN MANY BOOKS ARTICLES AND POLICY REPORTS ON THESE TOP. MY TESTIMONY IS ALSO INFORMED BOB BY MY SERVICE AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICAN AFFAIRS. WHICH INCLUDES COMMISSIONERS WHO ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR THE STATE SENATE AND STATE ASSEMBLY. TO ME THIS BILL IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT HOW ALLOWING THE STATE TO BENEFIT FROM THE IMMENSE TALENTS AND SERVICES OF ITS RESIDENT POPULATION. THIS BILL IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CALIFORNIAN. THAT AS THE KEY WORD HERE CALIFORNIANS. THE LAST TWO DECADES THE STATE HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE BENEFIT. FROM THE TALENT AND POTENTIAL OF ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. INCLUDING ALLOWING STUDENTS WERE STATE RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION STATUS TO OBTAIN DRIVER'S LICENSES ATTEND A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. PAY IN STATE TUITION AND QUALIFY FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID. THIS LEGISLATURE AND THIS GOVERNOR ALSO HAD THE WISDOM TO ALLOW ALL STATE RESIDENTS TO OBTAIN PROFESSIONAL LICENSES. ENABLING THEM TO UTILIZE THEIR TALENTS IN JOBS RANGING FROM COSMETOLOGIST AND REAL ESTATE BROKERS TO ACCOUNTANTS AND ATTORNEYS. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY A LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THOSE SAME EFFORTS BY ALLOWING IT PER QUOTE A PERSON REGARDLESS OF CITIZENSHIP OR IMMIGRANT STATUS IMMIGRATION STATUS. IS ELIGIBLE TO HOLDEN APPOINTED CIVIL OFFICE OF THE PERSON IS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND A RESIDENT OF THE STATE. I SHOULD ADD THAT THERE ALREADY IT HAS BEEN IN THE DOCUMENT INDIVIDUAL SERVING ON A STATE COMMISSION THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. WHO HAD DHAKA ó AND WAS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT? ALL OF THESE ACTIONS ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE BOTH BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND BY THE US CONSTITUTION. FOR EXAMPLE AS WE WANT SEVENTY FOURS CAREFULLY WORDED SO THAT IS FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE US CONSTITUTION AND FEDERAL LAW WITH RESPECT TO COMPENSATION OF BORDER COMMISSION MEMBERS. S. B. ONE SEVENTY FOUR ALLOW ALLOW OUR STATE TO BENEFIT FROM THE IMMENSE TALENTS OF ITS RESIDENTS AND TO CONTINUE DEEPENING THE NOTION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CALIFORNIA. IT WILL STRENGTHEN THE WORK OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS INCLUDING THE ONE THAT I CHAIR ON ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICAN AFFAIRS. FINALLY THERE'S A LOT OF HEATED RHETORIC THESE DAYS ABOUT IMMIGRATION. AND MANY MIGHT INTERPRET WATER STATE DOES AS AN ACTIVE RESISTANCE OR AS A POLITICAL FIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE'S LEGISLATIVE HISTORY ON IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION. THIS BODY HAS BEEN TAKING COMMON SENSE STEPS TO ADVANCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION STATUS FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. UNDER BOTH DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. TIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT MAKING A POLITICAL STATEMENT AND REACTION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT IS A FAR MORE NOBLE CAUSE THE NOT. THIS BILL IS A REFLECTION OF OUR SHARED VALUES OUR SHARED IDENTITY OUR HOPES AND OUR DREAMS AS CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PROVIDE MY EXPERT OPINION ON THE STOP. THANK YOU AND CENTER JUST FOR CLARITY THERE'D AMENDMENTS IN THAT THAT YOU'RE TAKING THOSE AMONG ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

AND COME FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.

TAKE A LOOK AT THAT [inaudible] VERY GOOD [inaudible] THANKS ADDRESS. SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS. BILL AND AND I CERTAINLY EXPECT THAT IT WOULD. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR ITS RESIDENTS THOSE WHO WERE HERE AND WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR TALENTS AND CAPABILITIES OF EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THIS DAY AND AGE. THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER POINTS OUT WE STATE YOU BRING THAT FORWARD APPOINT IS DENIED. SORRY MIKLOS THANK YOU -- MEMBERS APPRECIATE YOUR TIME IS QUESTION AGAIN.

THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CHAU CHIU HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN REYES. REYES AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE. THAT NEEDS ONE MORE VOTE SO WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT VILLA QUAKE GIVES CHAIR THANK YOU AND THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER THREE SB. ONE EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF -- FOR THEIR WORK ON THE COULD YOU CLICK ON THIS BILL -- WITH AND THE COLLABORATION AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THE SCOPE OF THE BILL HAS A NARROWED BUT THEESSENCE OF THIS MEASURE REMAINS INTACT. S. B. ONE EIGHTY THREE WILL CODIFY THE COMMON LAW. PRIVILEGE FROM ARREST. US SPECIFICALLY IT CLARIFIES THE POWER OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO PREVENT ACTIVITIES THAT THREATEN ACCESS TO OUR COURTHOUSES INCLUDING BY PROTECTING THE PRIVILEGE OF A CIVIL UNREST FROM CIVIL ARREST. DECLARES THAT NO ONE SHALL BE SUBJECT. OR SERVED WITH THE PROCESS WHILE ATTENDING OR GOING TO OR FROM THE COURTHOUSE BROKER PROCEEDING. THIRD IT STATES THAT ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY EXECUTES FACILITATES AN ARREST OR A SERVICE OF PROCESS AT A COURTHOUSE RECORD PROCEEDING SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT FALSE IMPRISONMENT OR BOTH. TRADITIONAL CIVIL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN DECLINED HAVE DECLINED BUT THEY'RE ALSO I'M NOT ENTIRELY HAVE NOT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED I'VE INTRODUCED S. B.. ONE EIGHTY THREE LAST YEAR ONCE WE WERE ALL MADE AWARE OF NUMEROUS INSTANCES WHERE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY ICE AGENTS AT COURTHOUSES ACROSS THE NATION. WHEN ICE AGENT TAKES CUSTODY OF A PERSON WHO WAS ALLEGEDLY NOT AUTHORIZED TO BE THE U. S. THE AGENT MAKES A CIVIL ARREST? BECAUSE OF THE RECENT INCREASE OF THESE TYPES OF CIVIL UNREST I FIND IT PRUDENT TO CODIFY THE PRIVILEGE. FROM ARREST DOCTRINE TO PROTECT NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL BUT THE COURTS AS WELL. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS A PRIVILEGE ALSO PROTECTS THE SANCTITY OF OUR COURTHOUSES AND THE POWER OF JUDGES TO CONDUCT PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE. S. B. ONE THIRTY TO AT ONE EIGHTY THREE WILL FOSTER SAFE ENVIRONMENT AROUND OUR COURTS AND THE SHOWS THAT OUR PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. WITHOUT THE THREAT OF BEING HARASSED OR ARRESTED HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS WERE PAYING A FINE ACTING AS WITNESSES ARE SEEKING STATE SANCTIONED BENEFITS. AT THE COURTHOUSE SHOULD NOT BE TARGETED FOR UNLAWFUL ARREST OR DETENTION BY ICE THIS BILL WILL PROTECT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMMIGRANTS NON IMMIGRANTS AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SB ONE EIGHT THREE WILL ALSO PERMIT THE COURTS TO FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE SAFE AND ORDERLY JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A CRIMINAL ARREST. IF THERE IS A PROBABLE CAUSE OR A CRIME WITNESSED THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL IS TO LIMIT CIVIL ARREST AT COURTS IN ORDER TO ALLOW. FOR THE ACCESS TO AND DELIVERY OF JUSTICE FOR ALL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE. ALBERTO TRICKLE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. THE BILL IS A PERSONAL ONE THANK THE STAFF FOR THE FOR THE WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS IN THE AND AND APPROACHES BEEN TAKE ON THE BILL. THE BILL CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE OF INTRODUCED BY THINK DATA. THE THE NOTION OF BANNING CIVIL UNREST AND COURTHOUSES. IN BUILDINGS WERE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS ARE TAKING PLACE WERE ALSO ALSO BEING CONDUCTED BY PEOPLE TESTIFYING UNDER OATH UNDER SUBPOENA THINK IT'S AND IT'S IMPORTANT. FORUM FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE SAFE WHEN THEY TESTIFY IN COURT. WHETHER IT'S CIVIL OR CRIMINAL TRIALS THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING PICKED UP. AND BY ICE OR ANY OTHER AGENCY. THIS BILL TAKES TO TAKE SO THIS APPROACH IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL CONCERNS WITH THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT ALSO A ANY. KIND ANY CONCERNS OR POTENTIAL ARGUMENTS [inaudible] OF MY LIST OF A PROTECTION SO IT'S A GOOD APPROACH FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE TERM. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE OPPOSITION [inaudible] YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. ONE OF AMERICA'S GREATEST PETITIONS I SUBMIT. IS THE FIRST EXCEPT THE ALLOWING OF IMMIGRANTS PENSIONS COUNTRY SECOND [inaudible] THREE THE EXPLOITATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND THIRD AND FINALLY ACCEPTANCE OF IMMIGRANTS. IT'S BILL GOES A LONG WAY. TO CONTINUE THAT LONG AND GREAT TRADITION. OF ACCEPTING IMMIGRANTS. AND MAKING THIS COUNTRY A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS. IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE FROM THE FLETCHER BODY. PUBLIC THE MOST DIVERSE PLEDGE OF BODY NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY NOT ONLY IN THIS WORLD BUT NAY HISTORY THIS WERE.

OUR SENSE THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN ISSUED WE RECEIVED REPORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. THAT ICE AGENTS HAVE BEEN ARE WAITING OUTSIDE COURT ROOMS AND ALSO OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE ITSELF TAPPER HAND INDIVIDUALS.

HOW THEY ADMINISTER JUSTICE I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD? SCOTT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR LARA. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD UNCONSTITUTIONAL PLEDGED EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND INDEED. COURTS IN PARTICULAR OB AND THEY'RE SUBPOENAING SOMEONE WHEN WE WANT PEOPLE TO SHOW UP TO COURT. OF WEATHER IS FOR THEM TO IT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR IN RESPONSE TO THE COURTS ARE OTHERS ASK THEM TO COME FORWARD AS PART OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS SOMEONE THAT WORKED FOR ELEVEN YEARS. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'M A WITNESSES CAME FORWARD VICTIMS CAME FORWARD AND MANY OF OUR IMMIGRANTS AND THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE WERE A DOCUMENT OR NOT IS IRRELEVANT. BECAUSE THEY'RE HELPING TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER BY SPEAKING UP WHEN PEOPLE WERE VICTIMIZED IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO THE LAST THING WE NEED IS DISCONTINUED DIVISION OF IN OUR COMMUNITY. OF THE LAST THING WE NEED IS. FOR US. TO I'M HAVE OUR COURT SYSTEM OF ALL PLACES [inaudible] BE SUBJECT THE POLITICIZATION OF POLITICAL THE POLITICS OF POLITICIZATION OF OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY AND WE ALL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION THAT INCLUDES THE WHITE HOUSE. AND I WOULD I WOULD PROCLAIM THAT LOCKING CHILDREN UP IS A VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION NOT -- UP WOULD NOT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING JUSTICES OF SENATOR LARA AS SOMEONE THAT SPENT OVER A DECADE IT PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY IN THE COURTHOUSE. THS BILL IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE THAT ARE ACCESSING OUR JUSTICE AS IS. PERMITTED BY AND DEMANDED BY THE CONSTITUTION HAS ABILITY TO DO SO FREELY AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THAT THE JUDGES HAVE SAY ABOUT OUR COURTHOUSES ARE OPERATING I'M REALLY GRATEFUL OUR CHIEF JUSTICE. FOR MAKING THAT VERY CLEAR AS WELL AND FOR YOU SENATOR THE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON HER SENTIMENTS AS WELL. IF YOU MISS HARRIS. SENATOR THANK YOU OF FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD WHO IT WAS JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE. I'M SAN JOSE MENTIONED WHEN WE HAD THE CHIEF JUSTICE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE. ADDRESS THE ENTIRE BOOK LEGISLATIVE BODY THIS IS SOMETHING SHE MENTIONED. AND EMPHASIZED HOW IMPORTANT WAS IT FOR GOING TO PROVIDE ACCESS AND JUSTICE. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SAFETIES FOR ANYONE COMING THAT SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE SAFE PLACES SAFE HAVENS FOR ANYBODY. ALSO WANTED TO SHARE ONE PARTICULAR CASE WHERE THE ONLY WITNESS TO A VERY IMPORTANT CRIMINAL CASE [inaudible] WASN'T UNDOCUMENTED. AND HE WAS NOT GOING TO COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE WAS THE ISSUE OF HIS -- IMMIGRATION STATUS. IT WASN'T UNTIL HE WAS SURE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE ISSUE IT WAS HIS I WITNESS RECOUNT THAT WAS GOING TO BE. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THAT CASE. HE CAME FORWARD IN IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS RECOUNTING OF THE FACTS. THAT THE PERSON THAT NEEDED TO BE CONVICTED WAS CONVICTED. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY THAT COMES FORWARD. WHETHER YOU BE A WITNESS FOR YOU BE A VICTIM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE ENTERING A SAVE [inaudible] SPACE WERE THE ISSUE OF YOUR IMMIGRATION STATUS IS NOT WHAT'S GOING TO BE QUESTIONED IT IS YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF IS YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I AND AGAIN I DO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I AM PROUD TO BE. A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WITH YOU -- AND THANK YOU [inaudible] TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANNA. WHEN MY SUPPORT TO THIS BILL -- I CERTAINLY ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE REAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS TRUE FOR EVERYONE. AS A FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR I BELIEVE FUNDAMENTALLY THAT IF NOT EVERYONE THE COMMUNITY FEELS LIKE THEY CAN ACCESS OUR COURTS WE DO NOT HAVE JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND DOES YOUR LOT OF THINGS I THINK THAT WERE SET BY THE OPPOSITION THAT -- I'M GONNA REFRAIN FROM RESPONDING TO OUR ACCEPTED YOU WANNA SAY THERE WAS THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW IT'S NOT CONSTITUTIONAL FOR ALL CHILDREN TO HAVE A RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND THAT. WAS CLEARLY A A PINE ALREADY THE US SUPREME COURT HAS HELD REPEATEDLY THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO EDUCATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THAT BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID WE ARE IN A ANTI IMMIGRANT. XENOPHOBIC TIME IMMIGRATION STATUS AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THROUGHOUT HISTORY IS BEING DETERMINED AGAIN BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO. ARE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT -- THE PRINCIPLE OF IMMIGRATION AND AND THAT THE HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION IN OUR COUNTRY HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CHANGE AT SOME POINT SOON BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WE NEED LAWS LIKE THIS IN WITH THAT.

I'M S. B. SEVENTY ONE IS A BILL OUGHT TO ADDRESS A FUNDAMENTAL OVERSIGHT ARE RELATING TO THE THEFT OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS FROM SOLID WASTE ENTERPRISES THAT HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY A LOCAL -- CITIES AND AGENCIES. OUR CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE DISINCENTIVE OUGHT TO PREVENT -- ILLEGAL -- TASKS OF WASTE TOM. VIOLATIONS ARE RARELY PROSECUTED NOT ONLY BECAUSE PERPETRATORS ARE OFTEN HARD TO IDENTIFY. ABA BECAUSE OF HIGH LITIGATION COSTS IT'S NOT ECONOMICALLY PLOT VIABLE. I'D THIS BILL WOULD THEREFORE PROHIBIT ANY PERSON OTHER THAN A SOLID WASTE ENTERPRISE AUTHORIZED -- BY A SEVERE COUNTY IN REMOVING OR TRANSPORTING SOLID WASTE. BUT AUTHORIZES LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES TO PURSUE CIVIL ACTIONS FOR THE STUFFED. ON THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES A OP PLAINTIFF ONE OF THE HOLDING IT ENTITIES OUGHT TO SUE AND IF THEY HAVE PLAYED A PREVAILS I'VE CIVIL ACTION THE COURT WILL THE WORD REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. ARE AND PURSUANT TO ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE RECIPROCAL TYPICALLY LOSE THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY A LOT. OF THE PLAN WILL HAVE TO PAY THE DEFENDANT THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES. AND ALSO WITH THE COMMITTEES ARE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ACCEPTING LOCAL AGENCIES -- WILL HAVE TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO APPROVE OR REJECT A REQUEST OFF FROM A HOLLER TO FILE ONE OF THESE LAWSUITS AND SEEK -- ATTORNEY'S FEES ODD SO I'D THE HOLDER WILL HAVE TO GO AND BASS WE GET PERMISSION UP FROM THE CITY BEFORE -- DOING THAT AND THIS IS A SERVER CHECK MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THAT THESE ODD LAWSUITS ARE BEING WELL. I THOUGHT OUT BEFORE I THEY ARE BROUGHT. ON THE BILL ALSO HAS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OUGHT TO ADDRESS A CONCERN THAT WE ALL SHARE A WHICH IS PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY POOR -- WHO? WHO -- TAKE RECYCLABLES TO MAKE THE ADS -- WE DON'T -- WE'RE NOT THIS IS NOT ABOUT SUING THEM ARE GETTING ATTORNEYS FEES FROM THEM THESE ARE ABOUT IS ABOUT ORGANIZED I'VE BASICALLY CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. ODD THAT ARE STEALING A HUGE AMOUNT OF RECYCLING MATERIAL. AND SO WE PUT OUR A DOLLAR THRESHOLD ON AS WELL AS A REQUIREMENT THAT VEHICLES BE INVOLVED -- AND AT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK NONE OF US IS INTERESTED IN AND AND GOING AFTER OF THESE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS -- SO I COLLEAGUES THIS IS -- A BILL THAT I KNOW IT'S AN IDEA THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED FOR A LONG TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK IT'S I TIME TO TAKE ACTION WE'VE WORKED THROUGH THE SPELL WORKING OUT TO POLICY COMMITTEES AND OF ACCEPTED VERY THOUGHTFUL AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS. OUR CONCERNS -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOAT. AYE WITH ME TODAY I FOR IS ARCHITECTURE FROM ECOLOGY AND CHUCK HELD IT FROM. OUR PUBLIC SERVICES. THANK YOU FIRST WITH THIS PLEASE. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND CHUCK HELD THAT RIFF THAT REPRESENT REPUBLIC SERVICES TODAY. A FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU STAFF ON AND YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE STAFF IT'S NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE FORUM SHOWING. LOT OF PROFESSIONALISM PATIENTS AND ASSISTANCE IN AND GETTING TO THE AMENDS FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY. OF THE CALIFORNIA SOLID WASTE RECYCLING SYSTEMS BASED ON SECTION FOUR DOUBLE FIVE NINE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE WHICH AUTHORIZES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ESTABLISH SOLID WASTE HANDLING SERVICES. IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE COLLECTION PROCESSING RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTE A CALIFORNIA BASED ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LOCAL AGENCIES A SOLID WASTE ENTERPRISES. THE STATE'S INNOVATIVE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURES BEEN PRIMARILY FINANCED THROUGH THESE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS IN THE FRANCHISE RATES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE AGREEMENTS. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE SYSTEM THAT FINANCES THE NECESSARY RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO HELP ENSURE THE PROPER MONITORING REPORTING RECYCLING DISPOSALS. SO THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS STATED SHE OF THE RECYCLING ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS OF AB NINE THIRTY NINE OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX AND MORE RECENTLY S. B.. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE RACE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE AGREEMENTS ARE BASED THE ASSUMPTIONS A SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLABLES COVERED BY THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. WILL IN FACT BE IN THE WAY STREAMING WILL NOT BE STOLEN. BILL IS NOT ABOUT BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THESE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS RATHER S. B. SEVENTY ONE PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE FRANCHISE HOLLERS WITH AN ADDITIONAL. TWO PROTECT THE RIGHTS GRANTED AND LOCAL ORDINANCES. THE COMMITTEE MEASUREMENTS EGGS AT EXEMPT TRANSPORTING ORGANIC MATERIAL TO COMMITTEE COMPOSTING SITES FROM THE SUB CHAPTER DEALING WITH ATTORNEYS FEES WE'VE ALSO AGREED TO EXEMPT HOLLERS OF EDIBLE FOOD. AND HOLLERS OF FOOD PROCESSING. BYPRODUCTS DESTINED FOR ANIMAL FEED. THIS LATTER PROVISION WAS ADDED AFTER NGUYEN AGO SHARED AGREEMENT ON A. B.. THIRTEEN THIRTY SIX A BILL EXTENDING THESE BY PRODUCTS FROM THE EXCLUDING THESE BY PRODUCTS FROM THE DEFINITION OF SOLID WASTE -- WILL S. B. SEVEN ONE OPEN FLOODGATE FLOODGATES TO CIVIL ACTIONS TO STE UNSUSPECTING INDIVIDUALS KNOW THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE THAT A PLANE TO PROVIDE WRITTEN SEASON DESIST NOTICE TO THE OFFENDING PARTY. COPIES OF WRITTEN NOTICE TO CAL RECYCLING AND INFORM OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WE ATTENDED SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES. WE'VE ALSO AGREED TO SUNSET PROVISION THAT WILL ALLOW THREE YEARS TO EVALUATE EFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CIVIL ACTIONS. FOR THE ABOVE REASONS WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT PLEASE HAD GOTTEN A CROP AS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. I WENT STRONG SUPPORTER THE SPELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THAT THE SPONSORS OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS ON FINDING A SOLID MIDDLE GROUND HERE WE THINK WE HAVE FOUND IT. THE BILL AS WRITTEN BASICALLY GIVES THAT WASTE RECYCLING INDUSTRY ANOTHER TOOL TO GO AFTER UNSCRUPULOUS COMPETITORS. WHO ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE SAME RULES THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW UNDER FRANCHISE SYSTEM? AT CALIFORNIA'S SOLID WASTE FRANCHISES. ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOOL IN ACHIEVING OUR RECYCLING GOALS BUT ALSO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS INCLUDING AIR QUALITY FROM THE FUELS USED AND TRUCKS -- LABOR PROTECTIONS AND A LOT OF OTHER REGULATORY. THAT THINGS THAT WE FIGHT FOR THAT. REALLY WOULD BE UNDERCUT IF IT WAS AN OPEN SYSTEM AND ANYBODY COULD -- COMPETE ENOVIA LOS COMMON DENOMINATOR [inaudible] S. SITUATION. PACIFIC WE WE HAVE COMPANIES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE SAME REQUIREMENTS ENVIRONMENTALLY -- FROM A LABOR PERSPECTIVE. FROM RECYCLING PERSPECTIVE. AND THEY OUR CEILING MATERIAL THAT HAS LEGALLY BEEN -- ONE BY THE SOLID WASTE HAULERS BETTER SITTING AT THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S SITUATION THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. AND THAT'S JUST ALLOWS THEM -- TO RECOVER ATTORNEY'S FEES WHEN THEY SU THOSE ENTITIES. THANK YOU OF IT ALLOW ONE MORE WITNESS TESTIMONY SHOPKEEPER SHORT I. ERIC ATTACHED WITH RECOLOGY -- WE PARTNER WITH OVER A HUNDRED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE WASTE RECYCLING SERVICES S. B. SEVENTY ONE IS A IN OUR VIEW IS A COMMON SENSE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT PROTECTS OUR RATE BASES PROTECTS LE YOU KNOW VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS THAT RELY ON ACCESS TO THIS MATERIAL TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DAY. AND ALSO JUST KEEPS OUR LOCAL PROGRAMS FISCALLY SOUND SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE MANDATED RECYCLING ORGANIC SERVICES THAT WERE INTENDED TO DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT IF YOU'VE EVEN IF NAY MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH PANEM BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE pRECYCLING COUNCIL WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY BROAD WITH THE TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT CSUS ARE WASTE. TAKE IT AWAY WE LOSE A LOT OF WORK DONE WITH TESTIMONY THANK YOU DAVID AFFILIATION MARIN THING NOW WASTE CONNECTIONS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. SO COULD YOU BACKROOM THAT THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU WILL BE BRIEF A DENNIS ALBION -- UP BOBBY HAVE THE CULVERT GRAY FEES ASSOCIATION PACIFICUS RENDERING ASSOCIATION. AND IT AND A FEW OTHERS ARE THAT THAT. BUT RECYCLE ORGANICS ONE OF THINK THE CHAIR AND THE CONSULTANT FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND ROLLED UP SLEEVES. ON ON THIS BILL BEGIN WORSE AND THAT IT'S MAKING PROGRESS BUT BEGINS TO OPPOSE THEM AGAIN THE CHAIRMAN SOME VERY GOOD POINTS IN LAST COMMITTEE. ON WE'RE GONNA HOW THIS WOULD WORK. BUT WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR A JUSTIFICATION OF OF WHY THESE EXTRAORDINARY POWERS. ARE ARE NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF A SOLID WASTE THIS ISN'T THE THE OTHER DISCUSSED [inaudible] RECYCLING AND ENTITIES WITH LIKE BOTTLED BILL MATERIAL FIRST MATILDA COPPER ALL THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY SOME EXTRAORDINARY RULES THIS WOULD APPLY. TWO SOLID WASTE TO REALLY GARBAGE AND AND THOSE DETAILS SO SO THAT'S AN ISSUE I'D LIKE. TO JUST MAKE AN ANALOGY THAT. OF THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE BY LITTLE CONTRACTS ARE NEGOTIATED THE A AGREEMENTS TO THE CITY AND THE WASTE HAULERS. ARE REALLY KIND OF THEIR SCOPE OF OF OF PRACTICE. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT GIVES THESE EXTRAORDINARY POWERS. TO A PRIVATE ENTITIES TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THAT THAT CONTRACT. UP AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND AND REALLY THAT WOULD BE LIKE A SCOPE OF IT A PRACTICE OF WE GAVE. DOCTORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENFORCE AGAINST NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS THAT'S THE SAME POWERS WHICH WE DON'T DO BY THE WAY. SAME BARS IN SAME AUTHORITY AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S KIND OF AN AWKWARD. FEEL TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THESE THESE THIS PRIVATE OF ACTION TO ENTITIES TO ENFORCE AGAINST. A OTHER PLAYERS AND IT MAY BE USED IN A SHOT GUN MATTER SOME WILL USE THAT ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATELY. BUT THAT THEN THEY SEND OUT A NOTICE IS THAT. SEE SPECIFIC OR PRIVATE ENTITY IT'S A YOU NEED. TO OUR SIX TO DESIST EVEN IF YOU ARE DOING [inaudible] OF OF LEGAL ACTIVITIES INAPPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES SO THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE AND BASICALLY APPROVED. EIGHT YOUR HOLLY IS LEGAL IN WITHIN THE PARAMETERS AND SO REALLY SHIFT THE BURDEN ON TO THE HOLLERS THAT ARE DOING. MATERIAL FOR FERTILIZERS MATERIAL FOR US A HOST OF ERRORS INCLUDING BIOFUELS ANOTHER UP OPPORTUNITY SOAP. BUT TODAY AGAIN WE WANT TO COMPLEMENT THE THE THE CHERITON STAFFER FOR MOVING THE BALL. BUT AGAIN THERE'S STILL SOME ISSUES OUT THERE ABOUT HOW THESE POWERS COULD BE USED. A ARE GOING TO FUTURE IN FOR THEREFORE WE STILL SUPPOSED WAS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT US WITH GOOD AFTERNOON NOEL KRAMER'S CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I TO WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION. TO THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING AMENDMENTS TO FURTHER NARROW THE BILL HOWEVER FARM BUREAU REMAINS OPPOSED BECAUSE DESPITE. THE CLARIFICATION THAT UP. BUY PRODUCTS FROM FOOD PROCESSING GOING FOR ANIMAL FEED WOULD BE EXCLUDED. WEEK THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL INCREASES IN COSTS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. I'M IF IF THERE'S EFFORTS TO WHO CAN PICK THAT UP IN AND HAUL THOSE MATERIALS AND SO WE REMAIN OPPOSED AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU EFFORTLESS ATTRIBUTES OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS REPRESENTING THE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY I JUST LIKE TO ECHO WHAT NOEL JUST SAID. I'M OUR OUR GUYS I IN THE TOMATO PROCESS SEEN AND IMPEACH PROCESSING ANY PROP PROCESSING THERE'S A LOT OF BY PRODUCTS THAT COME OUT THE BACK AND WHETHER IT STANDS APPEALS ARE PETS OR WHATEVER IT IS. THEY'RE USED FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT BENEFICIAL USES SO WE HAVE MADE THE ARGUMENTS I HEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO WITH CAL RECYCLE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. I FINING UP BY PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED FOR BENEFICIAL USES WHETHER IT'S ANIMAL FEED WEATHER'S FOR SOIL AMENDMENT WHETHER IT'S FOR BIOFUELS WHATEVER IT'S FOR THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE WASTE STREAM THEIR BENEFICIAL USES SO OUR CONCERN WITH THIS BILL. IS THAT THIS IS GONNA HAVE A WIDE BROAD DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES WASTE OTHER WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DISINCENTIVE VISINE -- OUR OUR GUYS FOR TAKING THINGS TO IT FOR ANIMAL FEED AND FOR FIRST THE SOLEMN AND ANOTHER THING SO AS OF ALMOST FORWARD WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORK ON SOME DEFINITIONAL ISSUES WITH REGARD TO MAKING SURE THE BENEFICIAL USES ARE EXEMPTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE CODY BOILS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BIOFUELS LINES NOT POSITION. IF YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SINGLE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WAS CONSULTED HER. AT I BELIEVE THIS IS NOW WITH THESE AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED SHOULD SEND IT TO APPROPRIATIONS I'M HOPEFUL I JUST I'M. GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY I AM. THIS IS WHY I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND ON THE FARM BUREAUS OPPOSITION BAD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER I THINK I KIND OF UNDERSTAND IT BUT I DIDN'T I WAS FIXATED ON SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO -- I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THE FIFTY DOLLAR I'M SORRY THAT -- THE LIMIT ON INDIVIDUALS HILL QUITE FRANKLY I'M EITHER HAVE AN INCOME OR ARE INDIVIDUALS NOT THAT COMPANIES WHO AUGMENT THEIR INCOME -- BY COLLECTING AYE RECYCLABLES -- FOR AT SOME FIFTY DOLLARS RIGHTS. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IT'S A FIFTY A I'M MORE CONCERNED [inaudible] I WHETHER IT'S IT SEEMS AN ACCEPTABLE NORMAL NOT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE ON RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE MIDDLE OF HOUSING UNFORTUNATELY AND I'M PEOPLE DO. EITHER AUGMENT THEIR ON VERY LIMITED -- INCOME OR SOMETIMES THAT IS THEIR FULL INCOME -- AND IT WAS TOLD TO ME WELL YOU KNOW IT IT THIS IS A LOT YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE A LOT WELL I'VE SEEN SOME VERY. VERY INCREDIBLE SHOPPING CARTS WITH A NUMBER OF AND I IN I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A BUSINESS GIVE AND TAKE BUT I AM NOT -- I AM CONCERNED AND I NEED TO ACTUALLY GO TALK TO SOME PEOPLE IT MIGHT THAT DO THIS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD -- AND AND ENSURE THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT AND THE POSITION WE'RE PUTTING IN INDIVIDUALS AND HILL YOU KNOW I'M SORRY FOR THE COMPANIES THAT LOSING OUT OF COUNTRIES LIKELY TO MAYBE IT'S NOT THE MOST POPULAR POSITION TO BE. ADVOCATING -- FOR FOLKS OFTEN HILL I'M. YOU KNOW ARE NOT IN THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY BUT OUR EYES SOMETIMES AS GOING. THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND COLLECTING RECYCLABLES SO AT BUT I I I I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU I'M ALSOEXTREMELY EVER HAPPENS IN MY BUT YOU PROBABLY ALMOST EVERYONE'S DISTRICT THAT I KNOW I I SEE IT IN MY OWN. NEIGHBORHOOD ESPECIALLY SENIORS WHO ARE CLEARLY LOW INCOME INNER OPTUS TRYING TO EKE OUT A LIVING AND I'M THAT THOSE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT I'M INTERESTED IN. ANYWAY ENFORCING AGAINST I THOUGHT I WILL SAY FOR THOUGHTS FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT OVER A PERIOD TIME MINUTES SO IT'S IT'S IT'S PER DAY TO START. BE CLEAR ON THAT I'M ALSO IN V. I.. SET UP THE DIFFERENT. A SIMILAR VERSION OF THE SPELL WITH HAVING LAST YEAR SOME MEMBERS -- SUMMONED OUT SALAS I HAD A BILL THAT WAS -- ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN AND ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- THE AUTHOR IN SPORTS IS NEGOTIATED WITH IT'S GO COALITION ON HOMELESSNESS WHICH WILL FIGHT. TO THE DEATH -- TO PROTECT THE ABILITY OF VERY LOW INCOME HOMELESS PEOPLE TO COLLECT RECYCLABLES TO BE ABLE TO EAT AND AND LIVE. AYE THAT THEY ARE THE FIFTY DOLLAR PER DAY LIMIT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO COALITION ON HOMELESSNESS -- AND AT A BROUGHT HIM TO SUBMIT THE ENDORSED THE BILL. I AFTER THAT SO AYE WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE -- AND I RIGHT NOW I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO WHAT YOU'RE RAISING IN THAT YOU KNOW AND MAYBE I I DON'T KNOW AND I I'M GONNA GO DURING USE MY BREAK TO GO TALK TO SOME FOLKS IN AND THE DISTRICT. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH -- THERE. UTILIZING THIS PER DAY -- IT MAY BE THAT WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE COLLECTING BUT THEY'RE COLLECTING MORE IN OUR AREA -- BECAUSE I HAVE TO TELL YOU ON A DAILY BASIS LACE ON MY FRIDAYS WHEN I MY WELCOMING PEOPLE. TO COME GET MY CANS -- THERE THERE'S THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE AT LEAST IN MY AREA WHO I THINK ARE MAKING PROBABLY ARE ACTUALLY THERE. SUBSTATION IN THEIR LIFE BY THAT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT FIFTY DOLLARS I I DON'T KNOW IF ITS THE RIGHT NUMBER OR NOT I JUST DON'T WANT SOMEBODY -- PENALIZED NAM. IT'S THAT'S ONLY WHAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM I KNOW I KNOW IT'S SENSITIVE AND BUT I GROUP BY GROUP YOU 100% AND ODD LOOK LOOK MINE WE MAYBE AFTER THE RECESS TECHNICAL NOW TO SAN DIEGO AND WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU'D LIKE A LOT OF HYPE AROUND. BUDDY A LOGIN AND WELL WE'LL GO TALK TO SOME FOLKS THAT THEY I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD LOVE TO THEM BUT ALSO THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE MOMENTS THAT WE TOOK. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO NOT GET PERMISSION. FROM YOUR THE LOCAL AGENCY. BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT BEFORE THEY CAN FILE SUIT THAT'S JUST AN ADDITIONAL CHUCK COULD ASSUME THAT MOST CITIES ARE NOT GONNA WANNA AUTHORIZED SUITS AGAINST POOR PEOPLE. BUT YOU HOPE NOT. BUT THANK YOU THINKING. RESEARCH YOU AND THEN HIS VARIOUS THANK YOU WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I'D HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION -- THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION AROUND THE JUSTIFICATION AND I WILL CERTAINLY ATTEST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN UP SOME OF THESE LARGE SCALE CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THAT ARE TROLLING URBAN STREETS -- IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT I AND AND OPENLY OPERATING AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DESIGNATED ROUTES AND COLLECTION DAYS -- AND AND AND I'VE SEEN THIS THE AUTHOR IS TRYING ADDRESS A VERY. REAL N. LONG STAND IN FRANKLY A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE OUT TO DEAL WITH AND I THINK YOU'VE STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE ON ON TWO FRONTS WITH. YOUR EXEMPTION AROUND BYPRODUCTS OF AGRICULTURE AND SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION ON THAT BUT THAT SEEMS THE RIGHT STRUCTURE TO DEAL WITH. THAT LEVEL OF OPPOSITION AND I WILL STATE OR A COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO -- DE THE SENATOR MENTIONED COMING TO TERMS WITH THE COALITION ON HOMELESSNESS -- CENTER AND THIS ORGANIZATION ARE NOT ALWAYS ON THE SAME PAGE SO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THERE ON THIS ISSUE -- WAS GREAT AND DIE AND I THINK A TESTAMENT TWO UP TO TWO WHETHER THE RIGHT BALANCE IS BEEN STRUCK AT LEAST IN OUR URBAN CITIES BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THE STRUCTURES THERE. TO EXEMPT OUT LOW INCOME FOLKS AND HOMELESS FOLKS WHO WHO MAY BE FORCED -- TO TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT TOOLS AS CITIES ARE AND WITHIN THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS -- THE THE LARGE SCALE CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THAT WE SEE SO WITH THAT HAPPENED MOVE THIS BILL FOR DEAD. THANK EVERYONE FOR THE DISCUSSION NEW YORK THINK THAT IS A MOTION IS THERE SECONDS. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU HIS ARREST IN THE MISTER HOLDEN. THANK YOU AYE TO THANK YOU. CLEARLY YOU HAVE SEEN THE NEED TO ADDRESS A SERIOUS ISSUE -- AND THIS IS THE WAY TO ADDRESS IT. THERE WERE FEW CONCERNS AND I WANT TO TO SHARE THE CONCERN OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. A THAT WAS ONE OF THE CALLS THAT I RECEIVED FROM THE COMMUNITY IS THAT THEY WANTED TO BE SURE THIS IS NOT DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST THE POOR. BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY USED TO TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME. AND TO TO BE ABLE TO LIVE. TO BE ABLE TO LIVE. A ANOTHER -- CONCERN WAS THAT IT MAY PROHIBIT COLLECTING OF SOURCE SEPARATED CEREALS [inaudible] AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT IS ADDRESSED AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS COMMENTED ON WAS. BUT BEFORE I GET TO THAT -- IT. THE THE AMENDMENT AS NOTED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TRUE. ABOUT OF THESE BY PRODUCTS I THINK IS GOOD AYE IT MAY NOT GO FAR ENOUGH THOUGH. FOR OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS JUST AS WAS MENTIONED BY. ONE OF THE WITNESSES -- FROM THE OPPOSITION -- IT. SO FOR TALKING ABOUT ADDRESSING THEFT RINGS OR VOTE OR WORSE. MEET HAVE SOMETHING GET IT AT THE HAZARD BEEN THE THEFT RING THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR OTHER AGRICULTURAL HOME BYPRODUCTS OR AT ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS MENTIONED. EITHER TODAY OR IN PERSON THAT LITERATURE WAS KITCHEN GREASE. IT IF THAT ISN'T IT AS BIG AN ISSUE WHY NOT EXEMPT THOSE GROUPS I WOULD BE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS -- AND THE OTHER. COMMENT WAS MADE AND I'D NOTED HERE EXTRAORDINARY POWERS. AND I DID GET THAT -- GRANTING EXTRAORDINARY POWERS AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A CHECKS AND BALANCES -- PACIFIC WE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALLER. HOLLERS -- THAT MAY HAVE THOSE CONTRACTS O. DIDN'T MAKING SURE THAT WE DO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY -- BUT VERY. SO MY ONE QUESTION THEM. BESIDES THE OTHERS THAT WERE MOSTLY COMMENTS. IS ABOUT PERHAPS PROVIDING AN EXEMPTION. AND ADDITIONAL EXEMPTION FOR OTHER FARM RELATED ORGANIC WASTE AND KITCHEN GREASE [inaudible] A SO OUR PRISM I UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE SMALLER HOLLER SMALLHOLDERS OR AN ARM BOARD WITH DEVELOPER NOT. MISTAKEN CIGARETTE NECESSARY THAT THE LARGE ON THE SMOG OF SUPPORTING THE THE BILL IN TERMS OF IT CAN RESULT THE WEATHER TODAY RESPOND BY. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THESE LOCAL FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS ARE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN TYPICALLY A CITY OR AGENCY OF A CITY. AND HOLLER THEY NEGOTIATE BEGUSARAI WHAT'S WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE WHOLE HOLDING. AND AND WHAT'S NOT. AYE AND SO AND THEN THE HOLLER BASIC PAVE. A A FEE TO THE CITY AND IS ABLE TO THEN GO THROUGH ITS BUSINESS OF COLLECTING ARE AND ITS BUSINESS MODEL. AYE AND SO IF THE CITY HAS CHOSEN TO INCLUDE SAID GREECE ABOUT PART THAT'LL HAVE -- TO BUT IF THEY HAVE NOT SORT OF PART OF THE PART OF THE THAT ARRANGEMENT THAT'S BEEN NEGOTIATED -- BY OUT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WITH AYE AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE GOOD CONVERSATIONS AND WILL. PUT UP A CONTINUED UP BUT WE CAN PROBABLY. E. M. ISRAEL'S THE BOMB. THE HAULING FOR RENDERING AND RESTAURANTS HIS A HUGE AREA OF ORGANIZED CRIME -- WHERE? PEOPLE GO AROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND STEAL IT IT'S A MAJOR ISSUE SO WE WOULD. WE NOT WANT TO SEE THAT EXEMPTED. FROM THE BILL. JUST ON THE ISSUE OF EXTRAORDINARY POWERS JUST WANNA CLARIFY WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING ECONOMIC INTERFERENCE LAWSUITS TO FOLKS THAT ARE. INFRINGING ON FRANCHISES OR STILL RECITE BOTH THIS IS JUST ABOUT BEING A RECOVER THOSE ATTORNEYS FEES SO I'M NOT SURE FACT AND IS CONSIDERED AN EXTRAORDINARY POWER. BUT THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO BRING THESE LAWSUITS IS SOMETHING WE ALREADY HAVE UNDER THE LAW. RIGHT IN THAT IT REQUIRES. THE SMALL HALL HOLLERS THEN TO HAVE TO GET ATTORNEYS TO DEFEND EVEN IF THEY DO HAVE THEIR OWN CONTRACT IT IT'S JUST THE IDEA OF HAVING. IT WILL BE THAT I WOULD NOT TAKING THAT PHRASE AWAY FROM SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WOULD TESTIFY TO THAT. BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE EXTRAORDINARY POWERS -- BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT TO A MISTER BECAUSE OF SENATOR WIENER I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BUT I WILL BE LOOKING AT IT FURTHER. BEFORE COMES TO THE FLOOR AND ALSO IN APPROPRIATIONS WHERE I WILL SEE IT NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER HOLA. THANK YOU SO CHAIR OF THE I JUST WANTED TO ADD -- MOVE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I THINK DOES A GOOD JOB OF REFERRING TO THE ISSUES THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH THE BILL THAT WE PRESENT AND THAT'S FIFTEEN SIXTY SIX BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE OF A LEGAL HAULING OF WAY OF RENDERING. OF THOUGHT INEDIBLE KITCHEN GREASE RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE BASICALLY -- STEALING -- VERSUS THE LEGITIMATE HAULERS THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THAT AND GIVE SOME OF LEGAL OVERSIGHT THERE. AS I GUESS THE QUESTION TO THE THE QUESTION OF THE HOPE IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY. OF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGITIMATE HOLLERS AND THOSE WHO ARE -- PLAYING BY THE RULES TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING ARE -- NOT CAUGHT UP IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED LITIGATION AS THE A REPORT DESCRIBES SO THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE HELD HARMLESS IN THIS. FURTHER QUESTIONS HOUSE WAS MENTIONED YEAH IDEA. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL -- I DEFINITELY SEE THAT THE NEED FOR I THINK IT'S SIDE YOU KNOW LIFE. INITIALLY READ IT IT'S SOMETHING OUT JELLY. BE SUPPORTIVE OF PRESENTATION HAS MAYBE. SLIGHTLY CONFUSED ME A LITTLE BIT ON IT -- SIDE I WOULD BE INTERESTED -- I AM DESPERATE TODAY I KNOW IT'S GOING TO APPROACH US I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO THE CHAIR OF APPROACHES DRIVE. UP -- BUT I KNOW I DON'T KNOW SO I KNOW SHE'S VERY THOROUGH -- AND AND DIED HAS SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS. AT AT AS WELL SO I'M CERTAINLY TRUSTING TURN HER -- ABILITY TO TO MODIFY IT A APPROPRIATELY. SO I WILL SUPPORT AND ALSO BE INTERESTED IN SOME THE PROPONENTS SAY THAT I SON HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN CHATTING WITH THEM IF THEY WANNA STEP BY A MILE OFFICER DEFINE OVER THE BREAK IN AND HAVE A CHANCE TO CHECK THAT. INITIALLY SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF DISCONNECT ON HOW DE HOW. HOW THIS COMES TOGETHER AT LEAST IN MY MIND SO I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HELPS TO HELP MOVE IT FORWARD AND THEN NOT BUT ONCE IT COMES TO THE FLOOR? I SEE IT SEE HOW IT'S GONNA COME TOGETHER SO THANK YOU THANK YOU ALRIGHT SO ONE OF THAT. THIS ISSUE IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY DIFFERENT IN AN URBAN SETTING IN A RURAL SETTING IN AND THEN A RURAL SETTING WITH A LOT OF AGRICULTURE. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WANTED THE LOCAL AGENCY INVOLVED WHETHER WAS A SENIOR COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY ISSUE THE THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ALSO HAVE THE BEST PROBABLY THE BEST UNDERSTANDING. OF THE LAY OF THE LAND WHO'S COLLECTING WHO'S NOT COLLECTING AND WHY. SORT FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. ACTUALLY TAKING SOME OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT [inaudible] THERE ARE. ANCILLARY GROUPS WHO HAVE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF COLLECTING WITH THIS RECYCLABLES ARE CARDBOARD KANSEN THINGS. THAT'S ALL TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHEN IN SO. IDEALLY ONE IN FRANCHISE AGREEMENT. IS ISSUED SO THEY'RE IN A GOOD POSITION TO ESSENTIALLY ARBITER THIS. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES WE WANTED TO PUT IN HERE. THAT'S WHY THAT WAS IMPORTANT SO THAT. BEFORE SOMEONE IS. ON THE WRONG END OF THIS THAT THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION HAS HE BELIEVES THEY OWE I UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S HAPPENING THAT'S OKAY WITH US [inaudible] AND WE'RE TRYING. TO DO SOMETHING STATEWIDE THAT IS AT COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE REGION IT COMES FROM SO WE'RE TRYING. TO I FIND THAT AND THEN DEALING WITH AGRICULTURE THERE AGAIN LOTS OF DIFFERENT NESTS. POTENTIALLY MOVING PARTS THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF VALUE OF MATERIALS THAT ARE COLLECTED AND DISTRIBUTED. SO IT'S IT'S A COMPLEX AREA WHICH IS WHY I THINK THESE KINDS OF BILLS. ALRIGHT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. I EARLY APPRECIATE PARA OF GETTING USED TO A VERY THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK FROM THIS COMMITTEE HAVE HAD A FEW BILLS HERE THIS YEAR ANDI MEAN THAT VERY SERIOUS THE APPRECIATE. THE DIALOGUE WILL CONTINUE -- TO HAVE DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPONENTS -- WILL WILL WORK GONE THROUGH EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BRING THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE TO THE FLOOR AND I RESPECT WESTERN AYE VOTE.
