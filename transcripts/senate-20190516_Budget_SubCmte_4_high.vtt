INVESTED IN AT THIS POINT IN

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:31.524
TIME TO BE WASTED THERE IS

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.926
NOTHING THAT SOUTH TO PULL UP TO

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.294
THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'VE NOT YET

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.462
AND ON SEPT.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.596

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:39.031
PLEADED WITH DEPARTMENT OF

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:39.765
TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.734
IS THE PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGY

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:42.735
WE WILL USE TO DO THAT.

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:43.836
ON SET AND THE REASON THAT THE

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:44.970
PAS IS.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:47.239
CRITICAL IN A VERY DAMAGING WAY

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:48.374
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:48.941
THE CURRENT LEADER SYSTEM.

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:49.608
WHICH PAYS OUT OVER SEVENTY FIVE

00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:50.776
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.711
TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:54.413
CURRENTLY HAS THE BUILT IN

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.148
THRESHOLD TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.283
AREN'T EXPLOITING.

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:59.218
AND TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT LIMITS

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.520
HOTEL LIMITS FOOD LIMITS.

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:03.689
IF THIS IS PAUSED OUR CALENDARS

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.458
SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY SET TO

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:08.494
EXPIRE BY IBM NEXT YEAR.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.829
WE'VE ASKED FOR AN EXTENSION ON

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.130
THAT CONTRACT.

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.332
IF THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS PAUSED

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.034
THE COST OF THAT EXTENSION IS

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.836
GOING TO BE SKYROCKETING SO WE

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:19.605
WILL BE HELD AT A MUCH HIGHER.

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:22.341

THE CURRENT CONTRACT.

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:28.013
IF THE PROJECT.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.415
IF OUR CURRENT CALENDAR SYSTEM

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.283
GOES DOWN WE HAVE TO RESORT TO

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.519
MANUALLY OUR OFFICE HAS SEEN.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.721
I'M TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.289
THERE'S NO AUDIT THERE THAT

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:39.091
WOULD STOP PEOPLE FROM CLAIMING

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:40.426
MORE IN COUNTIES THEN THEY'RE

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.328
SUPPOSED TO WERE ALREADY PAYING

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.129
OUT MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.296
MILLION.

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.264
AUDITING STAFF ALONE AT THE

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.399
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WOULD MORE

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:48.400
THAN DOUBLE TO TRYING TO KEEP UP

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:49.502
WITH.

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:50.703
THE AUDITING OF TRAVEL EXPENSE

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.204
CLAIMS WHERE WE HAVE A SYSTEM

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.073
THAT DOES IT IN AN AUTOMATED

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.141
FASHION.

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:55.674
AND THE WORKLOAD ON THE

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:57.810
DEPARTMENTS IF WE WERE TO GO TO

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.045
A PAPER SYSTEM IS ENORMOUS RIGHT

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.914
NOW THIS IS AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:02.681
THAT HAS.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.016
WORKED LOW ROUTING AND PEOPLE

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.718
DON'T HAVE.

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:06.986
TO IT TAKES YOU KNOW PAPER

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:08.554
AROUND FROM PERSON TO PERSON TO

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.089
PERSON TO GET THESE APPROVED AND

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:11.190
SO.

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.324
THE ADMINISTRATIVE IMPACT ON

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:13.726
PERMITS WOULD BE HUGE THE

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.227
ADMINISTRATIVE IMPACT. TO THE

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.296
STATE IS VERY LARGE AND WE HAVE

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.697
A SECURITY RISK.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.633
THE SECURITY SYSTEM RIGHT NOW ON

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.568
THE CALENDARS IN THE REASON IBM

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.270
IS NO LONGER SUPPORTING IT.

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.571
IS BECAUSE THERE IS AN

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.108
EXPLOITABLE SECURITY RISK WITH

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:30.809
THIS PLATFORM.

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:32.611
AND IBM HAS SAID THIS IS NOT

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:33.212
THEIR INTENTION TO KEEP THIS

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.614
PRODUCT GOING AGAIN BECAUSE THIS.

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.216
IN THAT PAYS OUT SEVENTY FIVE

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:40.085
MILLION DOLLARS -- ANNUALLY MORE

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:41.921
THAN THAT.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.122
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT AS A

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.957
SECURITY RISK IN CYBER SECURITY

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.525
BEING ONE OF THE HIGHEST

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:48.527
CONCERNS OF THE LEGISLATURE.

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:49.628
WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE A

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:52.398
VULNERABLE SYSTEM WITH OUT A

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.100
PLAN RIGHT NOW TO BE REPLACING

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.136
THAT TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IT FAILS.

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.470
AND AGAIN THE RESOURCES THAT THE

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:00.406
LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY DIRECTED

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:02.041
TO THIS PRODUCT PROJECT.

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:04.577
ARE NOT IN ANY WAY RELATED. TO

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:07.279
THE RESOURCES SCO HAS BEEN

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.414
IMPROVED TO DEDICATE TOWARDS

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.715
THIS GAL OUR COMMITMENT TO

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:12.084
FISCAL REMAINS UNCHANGED THE

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.953
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WORKING

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:14.420
ON THE SCALE.

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:15.988
REMAINED FULLY DEDICATED AND AND

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.123
CHANGE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.291
RESOURCES THAT ARE WORKING ON A

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.459
LATER.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:25.064
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR AND A

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.401
HALF HE WIPES OUT LATER.

00:14:29.468 --> 00:14:29.568
YES.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.972
YEAH I WOULD MOVE.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.107
MISSION REQUEST I THINK THEY'VE

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:36.342
NOT MADE A COMPELLING ARGUMENT

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:36.875
HERE BUT IF YOU WANTED TO

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:39.678
CONTINUE.

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:42.014
OKAY SO WHERE.

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.449
THAT'S WITH REGARDS TO CAL

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.918
EIGHTERS.

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:48.487
THE TRAVEL NUMBER.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:51.290
FIVE REJECT REJECT THAT THAT TO

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:55.094
DECREASE ANOTHER WAY REJECTED

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.264
DECREASED.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.466
C. BUT THEN IT LOOKS LIKE IS IT.

I COULDN'T EVEN SAY IT'S ANY

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.005
SOUND AND FOUND -- WHICH I THINK

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:06.772
IS THIS BILL IS ALL THE WAY

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.107
COMPLETE ARE YOU SAY YOU HAVE AN

BUT THE ALTERNATIVE ONE THAT'S

THIS IS CORRECT.

00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:00.345
IT SAYS S. ZERO REQUEST FUNDING

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.146
TO SUPPORT.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.849

THEY WILL APPROACH AND THAT

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:12.958
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S NOT

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:13.158

AND THAT IS -- THE APPROVED BCP

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.468
BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.604
BUT WE DO HAVE A CONCERN WITH

THAT APPROACH.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:29.141
WE HAD A SECOND ALTERNATIVE IN

FURTHER DELAYS ON THE STATE

CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT

TWENTY THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYERS

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.465

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:47.221
DO THINK.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:50.291

EVERYBODY BELIEVES THE SENSES IS

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:00.901
SO IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD MAKE

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:04.338
A MAJOR INVESTMENT -- BUT I DO

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:06.073
BELIEVE HAVING SPENT SO MANY

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.142
YEARS OF MY LIFE WITH COMMUNITY

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.844

01:34:11.178 --> 01:34:13.981
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO REGION

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:16.317

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:19.020
AND NEIGHBORHOODS A WITHIN THE

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.254

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:23.257

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.592
GOVERNMENT.

01:34:24.658 --> 01:34:26.527
AS A FORMAL INSTITUTION DOES

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:29.230
EXIST OUT THERE I'VE SEEN IT ALL

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:31.866
FOR EXAMPLE IN COMMUNITIES OF

INDIGENOUS GROUPS FROM MEXICO

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:36.504
THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.739
NOBODY WOULD KNOW OTHERWISE AND

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:40.107
THEY SPEAK VERY SPECIFIC

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:41.575
DIALECTS BUT THERE ARE

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.677

THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A

01:38:57.898 --> 01:38:58.699
LITTLE BIT.

01:38:58.766 --> 01:38:59.633

YOU CAN KNOCK ON DOORS.

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.749
BUT IF WE DON'T ALLOW ACCESS FOR

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:19.086
PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY FILL OUT THAT

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:19.987

QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE CENTERS

01:39:37.705 --> 01:39:39.673
I THINK -- SIR ONE OF THE THINGS

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:40.574
THAT.

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:42.443
WAS POINTED OUT WAS THAT THE US

01:39:42.509 --> 01:39:44.712

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:49.450
A HUGE YOU KNOW COMPARING TWO

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:50.884
THOUSAND TO A HUGE ISSUE.

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:52.853
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY AN AREA

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.288
THAT WE HAVE CONSIDERED AND WE

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.924
HAVE ASKED OUR CONTRACTORS

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:59.293
COUNTIES AND CBO'S WE'VE

HIGHLIGHTED IN BRIGHT YOU KNOW

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:03.030
READ.

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:04.665
BUT IF THEY'RE NOT CONSIDERING

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:05.999
THAT IF OUR CONTRACTORS ARE NOT

01:40:06.066 --> 01:40:08.969
CONSIDERING THE VERY FACT THAT

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:10.437
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ACCESS.

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:13.574
THEN THAT'S A PROBLEM THEN --

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.108
YOU.

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:15.175

IT'S A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY --

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:27.588
AND IF OUR CULTURE TO SAY OH YOU

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:28.756
DIDN'T TELL US EXACTLY WHAT TO

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:30.858

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:32.626
INDEPENDENT THAT CAN BE

01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:33.827
PROBLEMATIC.

01:40:33.894 --> 01:40:35.062
AND SO KNOWING THAT IF THERE'S

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.397
CONTRACTORS WE HAVE OUT THERE

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:37.498
