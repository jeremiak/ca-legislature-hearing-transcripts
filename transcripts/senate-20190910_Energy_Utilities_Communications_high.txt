WOULDN'T BE OUR LAST MEETING HERE WE ARE AGAIN WELCOME TO THE CALIFORNIA SENATE STATE SENATE COMMITTEE AND ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR TWO BILLS TODAY. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX WHICH WAS PULLED BY THE AUTHOR SO WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED TODAY. WE'RE GONNA HERE A. B. FIFTEEN THIRTEEN. AND A. B. NINE THIRTY SIX WHILE WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WE'LL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE COMMUNITY HEAR TESTIMONY ON A. B. FIFTEEN THIRTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AS YOU AS YOU WISH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. ARE WITH ONE EXCEPTION ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN THIRTEEN IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD CODE CLEANUP BILL CAN MAKE SEVERAL CLEAR FINE AND TECHNICAL CHANGES TO VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE CODES. FIXES DATES ND CORRECT GRAMMAR. ONE SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENT IS INCLUDED A TO AB TEN FIFTY FOUR CODIFIED EARLIER THIS SUMMER WHICH AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS ESTABLISH THE WILDFIRE FIND. OUTSIDE OF THE STATE TREASURY. THE REVENUES FROM THE FUND COME FROM RATEPAYERS AN ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO PAY ELIGIBLE CLAIMS ARISING FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN THE EVENT THAT THE FUND TERMINATES A. B. TEN FIFTY FOUR REQUIRES THAT ANY REMAINING FUNDS BE REBATED DIRECTLY. TO THE RATE PAYERS. TAX COUNSEL HAS ADVISED THAT THE RQUIREMENT TO RETURN ANY REMAINING FUNDS TO RATE PAYERS JEOPARDIZES THE STATE'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN A PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM THE IRS THAT THE FUND IS ENTITLED TO TAX EXEMPT STATUS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE WALL FIRE FUND ITSELF BEING SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX WHICH WOULD BE A TERRIBLE RESULT. BOTH INITIAL AND ONGOING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUND IN ANY INVESTMENT EARNINGS OF THE FUND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. FEDERAL INCOME TAX INSURED A TRANSFER OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE WELFARE FUND TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE LONG TERM DURABILITY OF THE FUN AB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY TRANSFERRING THE FUNDS THE GENERAL FUND. WITH THE INTENT THAT IT WILL BE USED FOR WHILE FAR MEDICATIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. VERY WELL CLERK WE HAVE A QUORUM PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

WAITING TO BE MADE WHOLE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. THIS BILL DOESN'T TOUCH THAT FUNDED IT JUST TOUCH THE IT IT ONLY TOUCHES THE- OUTSTANDING FUNDS FROM THE FROM THE ON THE WILD FIRE SIDE THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. SO DOES IT AT YOUR DOES IT ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE ISSUES I JUST MENTION ON THOSE TECHNICAL ITEMS AROUND PACE IN TERMS OF JUST BEING ABLE TO TRY TO MAKE THOSE HOMEOWNERS HOLDER REGION THE NO THE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CHANGES AS REFERENCE WOULD BE PURELY TECHNICAL ARE. GRAMMATICAL. THE ONE THAT IS MORE SENSITIVE AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD PROBABLY THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE IN THE COMMITTED THIS TODAY.
