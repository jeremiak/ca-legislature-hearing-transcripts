GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR IN ORDER TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRIS CHAMBERS DEPUTY DIRECTOR C. SARS OFFICER RESEARCH. HAS TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CCAR'S FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE POPULATION PROJECTIONS. CCAR'S FALL POPULATION PROJECTIONS UTILIZED TO STORE TREND DATA INCLUDING DELCOURT COMMITMENTS IN INTAKE TO STATE PRISON TO PREDICT FUTURE POPULATIONS. CDCR SPOKE REJECTIONS THEY ARE UTILIZED ARE CUT OFF AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE PROJECTIONS TO YOU WHICH INCLUDES OUR CURRENT POPULATION PROJECTIONS COMPARED TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT PROJECTIONS FOR REFERENCE. YOU'RE LOOKING AT. INSTITUTIONAL POPULATION ALL TWENTY ONE POPULATION PROJECTIONS ANTICIPATE THE AVERAGE DAILY INSTITUTIONAL POPULATION WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND. FIVE HUNDRED FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND 1-001-200-0900 AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. OUR CURRENT ADULT INMATE POPULATION AS OF FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH. IS APPROXIMATELY JUST UNDER. NINETY SIX THOUSAND. TWENTY TWENTY ONE POPULATION PROJECTIONS INCLUDE ESTIMATED IMPACTS FOR EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ELDERLY PAROLE PROGRAM IN THE NONVIOLENT PAROLE PROCESS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED. BUDGET THIRTIETH KHALAF OF DATA UTILIZED TO CALCULATE FALL TWENTY ONE PROJECTIONS SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR SPRING TWENTY TWENTY TWO PROJECTIONS THE MAY REVISION WILL INCORPORATE DATA ENTRANCE THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THE YEAR AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS. BASED UPON ACTUAL LEVEL OF INTAKE BETWEEN JULY AND DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CDCR DID NOT RECEIVE AS MANY ADMISSIONS AS WE PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. AND AS SUCH THERE WILLBE A DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT TO SPRING POPULATION PROJECTIONS. WE WILL ALSO ADJUST% THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHEN WE WILL REACH NORMAL LEVELS AND THEN TAKE YOU TO RECEPTION CENTERS. ARE YOU. REGISTERED TO PERCEPTION CENTER STREET ON THE CONTRARY. THE FALL TWENTY ONE PROJECTIONS THAT ASSUMED INTAKE TO RECEPTION CENTERS WITH STABILIZER CREEK AND THE MCCORKLE'S. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND REMAIN AT THOSE LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE PROJECTION CYCLE. IN ADDITION I WILL ALSO BE INCORPORATING THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF SENATE BILL FORTY THREE. WHICH WAS PASSED AFTER WE COMPLETED OUR PROJECTIONS. WHEN WE LOOK AT PEARL POPULATION CEASAR EXPECTS ACTED PRO POPULATION WILL DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE DAILY PEARL POPULATION. WILL BE PROJECTED TO APPROXIMATELY FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THE ANTICIPATED DECREASE SOME PRO POPULATION IS RELATED TO CHANGES DUE TO EARN DISCHARGE AS WELL AS LENGTH OF PAROLE TERMS FOR MOST PAROLEES. IT WENT INTO EFFECT JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. THE POLLING CHANGE ALLOWS MOST NON SEX REGISTRANT DETERMINEDLY SENTENCE PAROLEES RELEASED FROM PRISON. AFTER JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY CONSERVING TO YOUR PRO. APPROPRIATE THREE YEARS FOR MOST PROBABLY SPENT AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. IN LOOKING AT OUR JUVENILE POPULATION CITIES ARE PROJECTS TO TOTAL JUVENILE AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION LIKE SEVEN EIGHT TEN POINT 7% DECREASE FROM JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND REACH SIX HUNDRED EIGHTEEN YEARS BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THEN FURTHER DECREASED. TWENTY POINT THREE YEARS. BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE NOW THAT IS AN AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION NUMBER NOT THE ACTUAL POPULATION NUMBER. THAT WE WOULD SEE AND- JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT IS PROJECTED DECLINE REFLECTS ANTICIPATED CHANGES- ACID JUBILATION OF JUVENILE JUSTICES REALIGNED INTO OUR LOCAL SYSTEMS. ALSO DUE TO THIS CHANGE THE PROJECTIONS ASSUMED NO ADDITIONAL YOUTH WOULD BE RECEIVED AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW YEAH I'M OPEN FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT PANELIST. KEEP AN EYE ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE WITHHOLD RECOMMENDATION ON THE POPULATION RELATED BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS UNTIL THE MAY REVISION WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL SUBMIT REVISED POPULATION PROJECTIONS AND ASSOCIATED BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS. OKAY AT THANK YOU I WAS WONDERING I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT- LOOKING AT THE TABLE YOU HAVE HERE YOU HAVE SOME FLUCTUATION. THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPY AND HAPPENING WITH THE POPULATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS- AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH STAFFING LEVELS WHEN WE HAVE. THESE FLUCTUATIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THIS IS BATTLING THE CLAIM ACTIVITY DIRECTOR OFFICE OF THE SCHOOL SERVICES FOR CDC ARE TO THE EXTENT WE- I JUST HOUSING TO ACCOMMODATE THE REDUCE POPULATION THOSE ADJUSTMENTS ARE CAPTURED WITHIN THE ANNUAL POPULATION ADJUSTMENTS SO. IF THERE IS A STAFFING REDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN DOWN AT THAT TIME. FOR EXAMPLE ME CLOSE TO LOCATION WAS THAT YOU SHOULD BE TOOK DOWN SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SESSIONS ONE TIME EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN POSITIONS ON THE LAKE. AND SO ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE PINK SLIPPED THEIR VACANCIES THAT YOU ALREADY HAD OR. I WOULD HAVE TO DIVERT OR LABOR FOLKS TO GET YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THE EXACT PROCESS BUT THE IDEA WAS IS THAT- POSITIONS WERE- WELL WE'RE ACCOMMODATED THROUGH VOLUNTARY TRANSFER PROCESS. AND OTHER MOVEMENTS AND SO THE WE MINIMIZED THE LAYOFFS- AND I BELIEVE WE HAD VERY FEW IF ANY LAYOFFS. OKAY THANK OKAY SO THEN I JUST UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY SO WE'RE NOT REDUCING. STOP US FOR THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE WHICH IS MOVING THEM AROUND. VACANT POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO THAT THE POSITIONS WERE REDUCED AND THEN INSTEAD OF BACKFILLING BEHIND A VACANT POSITION AT ANOTHER INSTITUTION WE'VE MOVED THAT PERSON TO THAT THAT MAKE IT POSITION SO WE DIDN'T HIRE A NEW POSITION WE RELOCATED EVERY ALLOCATED OUT BUT STILL TOOK BE COMMENSURATE REDUCTION IN STAFFING LEVELS STORE- STAFFING LEVELS WERE REDUCED BY THOSE EVENTS. I THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION SEARED IN A COMBINATION OF BOTH. AND THEN HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN THE JAILS. WE HAVE WE NOT MANY PEOPLE IN JAIL AWAITING TRANSFER TO CDCR. RIGHT NOW WE'RE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TWO HUNDRED- THAT ARE IT IN THE COUNTIES BECAUSE WE DID HAVE TO SUSPEND INTAKE AS A RESULT OF THE OMICRON SEARCH- AND SO WE HAVE RESUMED INTAKE AT BOTH NORTH KERN AND WHAT'S GOING TO LIMITED BASIS- AND WE ARE. YOU KNOW AS SOON AS IT SAFE TO. BRING THOSE- OFFENDERS INTO THE STATE'S INSTITUTIONS WILL DO SO BUT WE ARE SLOWLY BRINGING THEM BACK SO THAT WE CAN OBSERVE ALL PUBLIC PROTOCOLS AND SPOKESPERSONS. DISTANCING AND QUARANTINE. ARE WE STARTING TO CREATE A PLAN AROUND THE IDEA THAT THIS IS AND THAT MAKE IT IT'LL STAY WITH US. THE PENTATHLON OF IRIS. THANK YOU WHAT WE HAVE- WHAT'S WHERE WE HAVE MANY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE- OUR ROADMAP TO RE OPENING AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE TO. ESTABLISH MOVEMENT WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS TESTING VACCINES- AND QUARANTINES SO ALLOF THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT ARE NOW PUT IN PLACE AND ESTABLISHED WORKING WITH OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE AND SO THOSE WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT- TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE THE SOCCER- TO OCCUR. OCCURS OKAY THANK YOU BECAUSE OF COLLEAGUES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU THEN WE CAN MOVE ON TO UPDATE ISSUE NUMBER TWO. WHICH IS AN UPDATE ON COVER NINETEEN IN THE PRESENCE. HELLO KATHLEEN ALLISON SECRETARY FOR CITY CIGAR- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME AND OUR CDCR STAFF TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY.

IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT TOOK QUICK ACTION TO PROTECT THE POPULATION BY CLOSING THE INTAKE SUSPENDED IN PERSON VISITING A FAMILY VISITING AND LIMITING UNNECESSARY MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT A STATE WIDE MODIFICATION PROGRAM. I'M NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DR TO DIRECTOR GIPSON AND DOCTOR BACK TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE MEASURES TAKEN TO ADDRESS CODE. NINETEEN WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRPERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM KIND OF GETS INTO THE DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND THANK YOU SECRETARY ALISON. IS I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE STEPS THE DEPARTMENT HAS CONTINUED TO TAKE EVERY SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED. TO HELP MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF KOBE IT WITHIN OUR SYSTEM TO KEEP OUR POPULATION AND OUR STAFF SAFE. WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE AS IT RELATES TO SELL SCREENING OR COVERT NINETY SYSTEM SYMPTOMS WHAT ARE EMPLOYEES WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT BEFORE EMPLOYEES REPORT TO WORK. THEY ARE CONDUCTING A SELF SCREENING THAT THEY HAVE COBIT NINETEEN SYMPTOMS THEY ARE NOT REPORTING. WE CONTINUE TO TEST BOTH OUR STAFF AND THE POPULATION. WE CONDUCT SURVEILLANCE TESTING WITH OUR STAFF WHO ARE UNVACCINATED TO TEST FLIGHTS A WEEK. AS WELL AS WELL WE ARE IN THE OUTBREAK PHASE AT A PRISON WE INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF TESTING FOR BOTH. STAFF AND THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. WE CONTINUE TO PRAY AND UTILIZE I. ACQUIRED PROTOCOL WHEN I. A POSITIVE CASE OF CODE THAT ARE SYSTEM. OR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CLOSE CONTACTS. WE CONTINUE TO ENFORCEABLE ASKING MANDATE WITH OUR POPULATION AND OUR STAFF. OUR STAFF WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR QUE IN NINETY FIVE. OR IN NINETY FIVE BASED ON THEIR WORK SITE. AS WELL AS OUR POPULATION WHO WERE PROVIDED SURGICAL MASKS. ADVOCATE IN NINETY FIVE. WE CAN TAILOR ENCOURAGE VACCINATIONS ARE STAFF AND THE POPULATION. AND I GET EXCITED OVER THE MEMBERS OF THE SECRETARY JUST SHARE BECAUSE YOU LOOK BACK A FEW MONTHS AGO IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF THE TECH OR WHAT ARE STAFF MEMBERS. AND WE WERE AT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. AND TO SEE TODAY THAT WERE AT 72% AND 8% INCREASE SHOWS THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO CONTAIN ENCOURAGE VACCINATION AND BOASTING. AMONG OUR STAFF AND THE INCARCERATED POPULATION PATIENT EDUCATION AND EDUCATION FOR STAFF AS IT RELATES TO COPE AT NINETEEN. UNDERSTANDING THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN SPARED FROM HELP WITH THE TEETH THAT WE SEE OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A DUE DILIGENCE THAT OUR EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO GET FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE. OF COMPLIANT WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE AND COBIT PROTOCOLS. IN RESPONSE TO THE- OPPRESSORS THE DEPARTMENT ACTIVATED DEPARTMENTS OPERATIONS CENTER AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. AND AT THE PRESENT THE INCIDENT COMMAND POST STEP. THESE TWO ENTITIES THE DEPARTMENT'S OPERATIONS CENTER FROM A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE. THE INSTITUTIONAL INCIDENT COMMAND POST FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVELS. ALLOW THIS INDUSTRY TO REALLY. MANAGE AND NAVIGATE OUR WAY THROUGH THE RESEARCH IDENTIFIER RESOURCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS RESOURCE NEED IS QUICKLY. IDENTIFY STRATEGIES BEST PRACTICES ABOUT COLLABORATIVE PERSPECTIVE BETWEEN CDC ARE AT CCAC AT. A DISPLAY AT THE SECRETARY SPOKE ABOUT WE DID A MODIFIED PROGRAM FOR FIVE WEEKS WHICH ENDED YESTERDAY TO REALLY SLOW DOWN MOVEMENT WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF COBIT. AT AND THAT INCLUDED- SUSPENDING OF COUNTY INTAKE OR REACH TO BE ONLY REDUCING THE NUMBERS AS WELL AS ALL THE ALLOW INNOCENT MOVEMENT WITHIN THE SYSTEM. WE ALSO. CONGREGATE ACTIVITIES VISITING PROGRAMMING EDUCATION I ISSUE THE T. BUT UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE FOR OUR POPULATION TO STAY CONNECTED WITH THEIR LOVED ONES ON THE IN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS FOR THE LOVED ONES TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT AND CHECK ON THEIR LOVED ONES IN SIGHT. WE MAKE SURE THAT THE POPULATION HAD ACCESS TO TELEPHONES. VIDEO BETHANY AS WELL AS RECREATIONAL YARD CANTEEN SERVICES A DELIVERY OF EDUCATIONAL SELF HELP. MATERIALS TO THEIR CELLS SO THAT THEY CAN STAY BUSY. AS STATED THE MODIFY PROGRAM IS TODAY SO OUR PRISONS WILL BE REVERTING BACK TO THE FACE THAT THEY FALL INTO ON THEIR DEPARTMENTS REACH ROADMAP TO RE OPENING. AND WE CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THAT COLD IT CHANGES IN OUR RESPONSE AS THE CHANGES. WERE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO NORMAL PROGRAM BUT IN OUR SYSTEM. SO WE WORK ON A NEW ROADMAP TO RE OPENING THAT IS BEING RELEASED TODAY- THAT HELPS TO REALLY GO GUYS TO OUR PRESENCE ABOUT HOW WE NAVIGATE. AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS IT MAY TAKE BETWEEN A POSITIVE CASE BEFORE THEY COULD MOVE TO THE NEXT PHASE. SO IF YOU CHECK OUR WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE PROBABLY OVER THE NEXT. FEW DAYS MANY WILL STILL BE IN AT OUTBREAK FAZER PHASE ONE AS WE NAVIGATE OUR WAY THROUGH. AND THAT HAVE A POSITIVE. CASES WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD. AS WE LOOKED AT LAW. AND GET BACK TO OPEN OUR PRESS UP BELOW BIT IT MEANS INCREASING. BUT THE SYSTEM- INCREASE AND TAKE ON THE COUNTY JAILS AS A SECRETARY SPOKE- SPOKE EARLIER. WE DO HAVE A COUNTY BACK LAW. AS A WE ARE WORKING TO BRING THOSE FOLKS AND FROM THE COUNTIES. BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL MOVEMENT WITHIN THE SYSTEM. OF COURSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S MOVEMENT MATRIX REQUIRES. TESTING OF THE INDIVIDUAL AT. THE BITE QUARANTINE PERIOD. SO WE'RE GOING EVERY WE CAN TO MAKE MORE SAY IN THIS. TO MEDICAID SPREAD OF HOPE IT. ADDITIONALLY WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OUR VENTILATION SYSTEMS WITH OUR PRESENCE. AND WHERE APPROPRIATE OUR STAFF OR- INSTALLING MARC. WE HAVE ALSO PURCHASE. A PORTABLE HELP A FILTER UNITS THAT WE ARE INSTALLING CONGREGATE AREAS. EDUCATION I. S. U. T. T. VISIBLE SPACES SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE CAPACITY AND GET BACK TO NORMALIZE OUR PROGRAM OUR POPULATION. AND THOSE WE SERVE. AB AS SECRETARY STEP BY STEP AND DOCTOR BAKER HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. I DO HAVE A ALEJO. HI GREETINGS MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S ORLANDO SANCHEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITH ALL ACTION ON THE PROPOSED RESOURCES FOR COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSEAND TOLERATE VICE PROPOSAL AT THE MAY REVISION IS AVAILABLE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CDCR WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE. HOWEVER AT THE TIME THAT WE CONDUCTED OUR ANALYSIS THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO JUSTIFY THE ESTIMATED COSTS. EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT PROVIDED PROJECTIONS ON THE NUMBER OF INMATES EMPLOYEES REQUIRING TEST. THE COST PER TEST OR THE AMOUNT OF EXPECTED OVER TIME THAT LED TO THESE COULD GET PROJECTIONS. IN ADDITION THE PROTECT THE PROJECTIONS OF THE INMATE POPULATION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IS LIKELY TO BE REVISED DOWNWARD AT THE MAY REVISION. AS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE HEARING. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES IN THE PANDEMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS EMERGENCE OF A NEW VARIANT COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES. AND CURRENTLY PROPOSED. THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF PROVIDE A REVISED PROPOSAL SHOULD INCLUDE ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATION. AND ACCOUNT FOR THE REVISED PROJECTIONS AND ANY CHANGES AND PANDEMIC CONDITIONS THANK AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. HI THANK YOU I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT IT WILL FIRST OF ALL I WANNA OF KNOWLEDGE THE IMPROVEMENT THAT WE'VE SEEN AND VACCINATIONS FROM THE LAST TIME. WE WERE HERE AND SO I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF THE IF THE CITY STATEWIDE SYSTEM- THAT A LOT OF PROGRESS- BUT WE DO HAVE A COUPLE PRESENTS WHERE ON THE PROGRESS IS NOT AS IMPACTFUL AS YOU SEEN IN OTHER. PLACES AND THEN FROM THE LIST THE DA PROVIDE IT WE ALSO HAVE THE CONTRACTORS WHO ARE FALLING BEHIND IN THEIR VACCINATION RATES COMPARED. TO YOUR STAFF SO CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THE STRATEGIES THAT YOU'RE USING TO TRY TO IMPROVE- THE RATES AMONGST CONTRACTORS. AND THEN ALSO WITH A SPECIFIC PROCESS OVERSEEN A VERY DIFFERENT. A NUMBER FOR EXAMPLE AT THE- HI THIS THERE IS THE- DO WE HAVE SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO TARGET THOSE. WITHOUT LIARS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- KIND OF GIPSON DIRECTOR I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND INVITE DOCTOR BIG TO COME IN IF I MISSED SOMETHING AS SO AS IT RELATES TO THOSE PRESENT THAT HAVE A LOW VACCINATION RATES TO AND I WOULD DARE SAY THEIR VACCINATION RATES ALIGNED WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE AT. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO. THE BUG STRATEGIES TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW. WE UTILIZE OUR CENTERS FAR STAFF THE POPULATION. BUT ALSO WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS IN IN YOU KNOW ON THE CRIME KIND OF- MAYBE SPOT IS A LITTLE BIT BUT WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS WITH DOING WHAT WE CALL A VACCINATION BEAR. AT PRESENT IS WHETHER IT'S FOR STAFF WORKS FOR THE POPULATION. THAT WE PASS THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE EMPLOYED AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS. AND I'M SURE WE'RE STILL LOOK INTO THE COMPUTER BOY THAT AT VARIOUS OTHER PRESENTS. THE GLEE. FOR PLEDGE OF WILL PLEDGE ON FLAWS OF. EDUCATION AT. A DAY TO SPEND WITH JUST TALKING TO WALKING WITH THE STAFF AND POPULATION IT REALLY INCENTIVIZE THEM. AND GET PEOPLE TO WANT TO VACCINATE THEM WHAT'S. ARE VACCINATED IS THE- WANT TO GET THE- AND WELL. BUT I I'VE BEEN DARE SAY YOU SEE THE LOW BACK. RATES ARE VERY SO TO WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS COMMUNITIES OF THOSE PRESENTS ARE LOCATED. WE CONTINUE TO WORK OUR CCAC AS A CDCR AND CLEAN IT UP THE CONTRACTOR NUMBERS AND ENSURING THAT. THOSE CONTRACTORS WHO PROVIDE SERVICES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. ARE COMPLIANT WITH OUR VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS AND OR TESTING REQUIREMENTS UNDERSTANDING THAT. THEY AS ROBERT YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO I KNOW WE HAVE STAFF LOOKING TOTALLY. ENGAGING WITH THE VENDORS AND THE CONTRACTORS TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR STAFF HAVE TO COMPLY- BUT WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET THOSE NUMBERS HIGHER. THANK YOU DIRECTOR GIPSON JOSEPH SPECTOR RECTOR OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I THINK THE ONLY THINGS I WOULD ADD TO THAT ARE- FOR ALL NEW CONTRACTORS THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL BE. VACCINATED WHEN THEY START WITH US OR HAVE BEEN APPROVED ACCOMMODATION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH OUR LIST IS THAT. WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS LISTED IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTORS. WHO MIGHT BE COMING IN QUARTERLY SEMI ANNUALLY ANNUALLY THE SERVICE AREA WHERE VARIOUS EQUIPMENT FOR EXAMPLE. OR THEY MAY HAVE AND- ARE SERVICING A GREAT MENTOR PROVIDING SOME SERVICE IN THE PAST AND REALLY. HAVE NOT BEEN ANY INSTITUTION IN QUITE SOME TIME. SO WE'VE INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN ENSURING THAT THOSE LISTS ARE CURRENT. AND I BELIEVE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR NUMBERS. ONE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD TO WHAT DIRECTOR GIPSON SAID IS THAT. YES FOR THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OUR CLASSIFICATIONS IN. POLITICAL AND CUSTODY. OUR VACCINATION RATES YOUR PASS. WHAT'S FOUND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALSO IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO OFFER. AND ENCOURAGE AND EDUCATE PEOPLE WE DO KNOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE VACCINATED. ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET INFECTED LESS LIKELY TO TRANSMIT TO OTHERS AND- MOST IMPORTANTLY LESS LIKELY TO. BE HOSPITALIZED OR SUFFER SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF. BEING INFECTED SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TARGET ALL OF OUR. UNVACCINATED RESIDENTS AND STAFF. THANK YOU WE COULD JUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE US WITH UPDATES- LIKE I SAID I DO ONE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE VOTE. WE HAVE SOME PROGRESS TO CONTINUE ON ESPECIALLY AS WE WANT TO KEEP BOTH STAFF AND MADE SAFE AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AS WELL WE KNOW THAT AN OUTBREAK. THE PRESENT OFTENTIMES THESE TOPICS IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AS WELL- COLLEAGUES QUESTION TH. MISTER JONES SAWYER. CONNECTION JUST KIND OF CURIOUS- OBVIOUS I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED INTO. IN SOME WAYS WHEN THE COMMAND CDCR. ON GETTING THE VACCINATION RATES UP SO HIGH- IN SOME WAYS IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE FROM WHAT I WAS HEARING EARLIER. AND AND KEEPING IT YOU KNOW 15% EIGHTY PERCENT. OF IT REALLY REALLY GOOD. THE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE COMING IN IS IT KIND OF. AND THIS IS PROBABLY MORE GLOBAL TRYING TO GET A SENSE. OF WHY. THEY DON'T WANT WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU WHY THEY'RE NOT GETTING VACCINATED. AMADOR IS THE THING WHICH YOU JUST SAID A MATTER OF FREQUENCY THEY'RE IN THERE SO INFREQUENT THAT THEY MAY NOT BELIEVE THEY NEED TO BE VACCINATED- IS THERE RATIONALE IS IT IS IT INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE GETTING THAT TELLS THEM FROM THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY NEED. OR THEY DON'T NEED TO BE VACCINATED EVEN THOUGH OF THE STATE EMPLOYEES LOOK LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A MIXTURE OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SAID ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC IS FOR A LARGE ORGANIZATION LIKE THIS TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD LISTING OF EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S COMING IN AND OUT OF ONE OF YOUR INSTITUTIONS CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING IT'S SUCH A LARGE- SERVICE THAT THAT IS PROVIDED AND SO- I CAN'T SIT HERE AND SAY THAT WHAT CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE CONTRACTORS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BEING VACCINATED. OR NOT BUT I THINK THAT BY THE TIME WE GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE'LL FIND IT THEIR ACCEPTANCE IN DECLINATION RATE IS PROBABLY MORE LINKED TO THE ACCOUNT TEAM WHICH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR CLASSIFICATION AS WE'RE SEEING WITH CALIFORNIANS ALL OVER THE STATE. I GUESS I WAS ASKING ANY SPECIFIC. THAT THE BACKS IN VACCINATIONS DON'T WORK THAT. YOU COULD CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS AS A MULTIPLIER. OR I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND YOU CAN MAKE ME. A FRONTRUNNER GET TO. WELL DIRECTOR GIPSON MAY HAVE- IT DISHMAN FORMATION ON THIS BUT I THINK WE'RE SEEING A FULL RANGE OF. OPINIONS AMONG BOTH THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN PRISON. ONE SECOND VERY IMPRESSED BY IS HOW PEOPLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS BASED UPON THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PERCEIVED RISK FACTORS AND BY THAT I MEAN. ARE AMONG OUR RESIDENTS FOR EXAMPLE ME VERY INFORMED DECISIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACCEPTANCE RATE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE ELDERLY HAVE MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. WHO ARE MOST AT RISK FOR ADVERSE OUTCOMES THEY'VE ACCEPTED THIS VACCINE AT A RATE OF OVER NINETY PERCENT. EXCEPT MISTER IS THAT OVER 80% AND THIS IS A POPULATION THAT HAS NEVER ACCEPTED A VACCINE IN OUR SYSTEM THAT MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT. SO I'VE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED AND I THINK OUR EMPLOYEES ARE DOING SIMILAR RISK CALCULATIONS BASED UPON THEIR SELF PERCEPTION OF RISK. IN WHERE THEY GET. THEIR NEWS AND THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA. OKAY IN A RESERVE ASK IS A BE TRANS. TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE I MEAN IF YOU'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL. AT A POPULATION THAT MAY BE A LITTLE RETICENT TO DO THIS IN YOUR RATES ARE THIS HIGH. IT COULD BE APPLICABLE TO REST THE CALIFORNIA OF BEING ABLE TO DO SO THAT'S- KIND OF WHAT I'M ASKING I KNOW IT'S A MICROCOSM OF THE STATE. BUT IT COULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN GET MORE PEOPLE VACCINATED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY. YEAH MIKE MY QUESTION IS JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE POINT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE L. A. O. THAT SAYS THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ONGOING A COVERT NINETEEN MANAGEMENT ARE STILL UNKNOWN AND UNPREDICTABLE WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR THE APPROPRIATION THAT STATED HERE OVER GRANTING SPENDING AUTHORITY. GOOD AFTERNOON AT MADELINE MCRAE MCC ARE SO WE BASE OUR JAN TEN PROPOSAL ON THE LAST. YOU MONTHS OF ACTUALS THAT WE HAD- AND COMPARE THAT TO WHAT WE HAD EXPENDITURES. AND SO WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IS TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT WE HAD AND WHAT WE'RE WHERE WE'RE GOING AND LIKELY UPDATED THAT THE REVISION WILL RE ASSESS AT A REVISION SO. WE INDICATED IN OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS A POINT IN TIME. AND WILL BE REFINED. OKAY THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY WHEN ALSO WELCOME ARCHER OR BUDGET MR KING. THANK MEASURES JUST A QUICK QUESTION BACK TO SEE IF YOURSELF I GUESS DID DID I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY THAT YOU. ARE ASKING THE NEW CONTRACTORS TO GET VACCINATED BUT DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THE- CURRENT CONTRACTORS DON'T HAVE TO. SWANA CLARIFIED THE WAS A SERVER HEARD THAT CORRECTLY. THANK YOU FOR ASKING FOR THE CLARIFICATION NO EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO BE VACCINATED HER PROVIDE A APPROVED ACCOMMODATION AS TO WHY THEY'RE NOT IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE WHO COMES TO STATES SERVICE NOW. KNOWS THAT UP FRONT AND THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF BY PRIOR TO THEM STARTING. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION AND IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE IT'S- ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE. IMPLEMENTING THAT WITH YOUR CONTRACTORS. I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S THE CONTRACTORS PER SE IT'S JUST A LARGE VOLUME FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE TRYING TO TRACK EVERYBODY DOWN. THEY'RE WORKING- YOUR DIFFERENT SHIPS DIFFERENT DAYS SOME IN THE INSTITUTION A DAY A MONTH TWO DAYS A MONTH ONCE A QUARTER. IT CAN BE CHALLENGING DURING THAT SO- I DON'T THINK IT'S A PARTICULAR PROBLEM TO THE CONTRACTORS. DO YOU THINK YOU YOU MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT THAT- HAS LA SOMETIMES PEOPLE'S OPINIONS HAVE LESS TO DO WITH THEIR- CLASSIFICATION OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT A PARTICULAR PLACE VERSES WHERE THEY'RE WHERE THEY'RE LIVING IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SO BASED ON THAT COMMENT- THE PEOPLE WHO I IMAGINE ARE IN CHARGE OF ENFORCING. THESE RULES OF THE WARRANTS AND THE WARRANTS ARE LIVING IN THESE COMMUNITIES AS WELL. ARE. YOU GETTING FULL COOPERATION FROM YOUR WORDS. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT FRANTICALLY PLEASED WITH. HOW MUCH SENIOR CUSTOMER EITHER SHIP AS IN BRACED. VACCINATIONS WHEN WE LOOK AT CLASSIFICATIONS INCLUDING WARDENS CHIEF. ORDERLY'S CAPTAINS IN THE TENANTS WERE SAYING ARE VERY HIGH UPTAKE OF VACCINATIONS I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP. ONE CALL DIDN'T AT ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE VERY SUPPORT. BUT WHY THE- FOR RATES AT HIGH DESERT PELICAN BAY CCI. I MEAN WE CAN GO ONBECAUSE THERE'S THEY'RE ALL LISTED IN THE RIGHT UP MILLCREEK. AGAIN I THINK IT'S MORE RELATED TO- THE BELIEFS AROUND VACCINATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS IN GENERAL- ACROSS OUR STATE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A VERY. VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU YOU MENTIONED EARLIER BUT YOU ARE ALSO SAID THERE'S A REQUIREMENT. SO YOU JUST ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE NOT TO. FOLLOW THE REQUIREMENT. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NO ABSOLUTELY NOT EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO EITHER BE VACCINATED FOR TO HAVE AN APPROVED MEDICAL OR RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION PERIOD. SELECTABLE I THEIR SERVICE IN ORDER. I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM HALF MY QUESTION THE BIGGEST YOU CAN ANSWER AND THE ANSWER DIRECTOR SO LET'S WITH THE HIGH DESERT YOU GOT 30% 35% BECAUSE THE STAFF. THE AND I GOT MY ARE YOU ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT 64% ACROSS THE STAFF HAVE A- THE EXEMPTION OR- WHICH WHICH WOULD BE WHICH WOULD SEEM FAIRLY. FAIRLY HIGH. IT ALSO THAT 67% WHICH IS EVEN HIGHER OF ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF HAVE A SIMILAR EXEMPTION. SO HI THIS IS KIRTI GIFT ND IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY A BIT- CURRENTLY THE ONLY FOLKS WHO ARE MANDATEDTO BE VACCINATED. ARE THOSE WHO FALL UNDER THE CDPH ORDER THAT DIRECTED US THAT IF YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES OR WE WERE GOING TO HEALTH CARE LOCATION OTHER PROJECT. SO WE HAVE STAFF WHO THE PRISONS ARE C. A. C. F. C. M. S. CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY I APOLOGIZE. CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY AND THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AS EASY TO HELP CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY. AS WELL AS FOR ALL OF OUR OTHER PRISONS IS THOSE HEALTHCARE MEDICAL- ANCILLARY STAFF WHO MAY WORK IN OUR CORRECTIONAL TREATMENT THIS- CENTERS ARE UP. PATIENTS PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT BEDS ARE HEALTHCARE CLINICS WHO ARE REQUIRED IN THE CDPH ORDERED TO BE VACCINATED BY THE REST OF OUR STAFF THERE IS NO VACCINATION REQUIRED WE DO ENCOURAGE VACCINATIONS AND IF THEY ARE VACCINATED THEN THEY ARE REQUIRED TO TWICE WEEKLY TESTING I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED CMS BECAUSE IT SAYS 52% OF CONTRACTORS ARE NOT VACCINATED. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT OUR DEBATE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS WORKING THROUGH ON MANY OF THESE CONTRACTORS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF SERVICE- EQUIPMENT AT THE PRESENT AS ALWAYS TRYING TO TRACK DOWN THESE FOLKS BECAUSE- BECOME MISSILES WILL RADICALLY SOME OF THEM I THINK THAT'S WHAT DOCTOR BECAUSE TALK ABOUT THE AGENCIES ALLEGEDLY. BUT IF YOU EVER PARTNERING IN A YEAR WITH A CONTRACTOR I'M NOW WE HAVE A SIPLE POLICY. YOU CAN EITHER GIVE US THE INFORMATION AND YOU DON'T. HAVE TO COME BACK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE ISN'T. YES YES WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE WIDEST FOR THE VERY LOW PERCENTAGE RATE THIS IS ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE CONTRACTORS. TRY TO TRACK DOWN TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE INDIVIDUALS. WHAT I SUSPECT IS HAPPENING IN THIS IS THE PART WHERE DR BIG TALK ABOUT WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAN UP OUR DATA IN SO FAR AS SOMEBODY'S CONTRACTORS MAY ONLY CAME IN ONE TIME AND-THAT ONE TIME AND THEY'RE IN A GOOD OUR SYSTEM AND IT MAY BEEN A YEAR AGO. BECAUSE A VENDOR WHO PROVIDES AT THE CHECKLIST SERVICE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO IN. TIME AS ALWAYS AS MAKE IT SURE AS WE GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT WE PUT PEOPLE OUT THERE NOT. NO LONGER. BURBANK SERVICE YEAH BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR THEM WHEN THEY CONTRA. COMES IN AND YOU DON'T HAVE THEM ON THE RECORD AND THEY'RE NOT BACKS AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENS. THAT'S ENOUGH. I WOULD HAVE THE DEPARTED I BIG I WOULD SUSPECT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED IN BUT I WOULD. HERE HE COULD HE COULD RESPOND YOU HAVE RESPOND FOR. THANKS AND FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING I WAS I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THOSE EMPLOYEES. WERE MANDATED TO BE VACCINATED I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION I'M TOTALLY MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION. NO IT THAT'S THE EASY PART EASY PART IS SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE NOT VACCINATED OR HAVE AN EXEMPTION YOU CAN'T COMMAND. THAT THE CHALLENGER WE'VE HAD AND WE'VE MADE HUGE PROGRESS OVER THE LAST SIX WEEKS OR SO IS IDENTIFYING ALL THOSE CONTACTING THOSE PEOPLE I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYONE WITH THE OPPRESSION THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST COMING. IN AND OUT **** NILLY DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S I'M CONFIDENT SAYING THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. RIGHT BUT BUT BUT BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MY CAR SO YOU'LL CMF. YOU GOT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE CONTRACTORS THAT AREN'T VACCINATED. WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE OF THEM SHOWS UP TO DO THEIR JOB. SO WE HAVE A LISTED EVERY INSTITUTION OF EVERYONE WHO REQUIRED TO BE VACCINATED AND IF PEOPLE COME IN AND THEY'RE NOT BACKS NEEDED. ARM THEY AND THEIR SUPERVISOR OR THE PERSONAL TO CONTRACT FOLLOWS UP WITH THOSE FOLKS. STORY CAN. GO AHEAD SO THEY'LL HAVE TO SHOW PROOF OF VACCINATION BEFORE BEING ABLE TO ENTER THE FACILITY VACCINATION CARD THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED DO CHAU. BUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE NOT COMING IN AND OUT WITHOUT BEING VACCINATED THIS TIME. OKAY SO YOU'RE YOU'RE UNDERSTANDING IS IN THAT FACILITY FOR EXAMPLE IN THE DIRECTOR LET'S NOT FACILITIES THAT ARE A REQUIREMENT TO VACCINATE THAT ANYBODY ENTERING THE FACILITY- WOULD EITHER HAVE TO BE VACCINATED OR OR THE- SHOW FOR YOU KNOW- OR HAVE A EXEMPTION. THAT'S CORRECT AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU- IN THE NEXT WEEK OR ARE CONTINUALLY WITH THAT LIST OF CONTRACTORS BECAUSE AS I SAID AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THAT REFINING A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN REALLY STILL WORKING FOR US AT ALL. THANK YOU. IRAQ MISSPELLED IF. I AM JUST CURIOUS AND I'M I DID STEP IN- A LITTLE- AFTER YOUR YOUR UPDATE WHAT'S THE KEYS OF ABLE BEING ABLE TO GET A VACCINE DO YOU DO THEM ON SITE DO. WHAT STAFF NEED TO GO TO ANOTHER LOCATION FOR A VACCINE. NO THANKS FOR ASKING WE MAKE AVAILABLE VACCINES AT ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON ALL SHIPS SO IT'S VERY EASY AND WE CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE SO THAT AVAILABILITY TO OUR EMPLOYEES. AND IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS THE VOTE SO WE HAVE. DATA AND CALCULATIONS WERE VACCINATED PARTIALLY VACCINATED- DO WE HAVE ALSO LOOSE BOOSTED AND UNVACCINATED AND OF THE UNBOXED POPULATION WHAT PERCENTAGE OF HAD. CODED AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OVERALL HAVE HAD COVERAGE. WE CAN MAKE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU IT THESE ARE VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE MONITOR AS WELL SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE US A LIST OF SPECIFICS I ENSURE WE CAN GENERATE THAT. THANK YOU. THE WALK. ANYMORE QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME PLEASE KEEP US UPDATED AS THOSE NUMBERS HOPEFULLY IMPROVE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE- CC ARE IN THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. ON STAFF COMPLAIN PROCESS BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH A TOPIC WE- HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR LAST YEAR AND I HOPE WE GET SOME BETTER ANSWERS THIS YEAR. THE PANEL GETTING STARTED AS LISTED ON THE AGENDA MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMY MILLER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF CORRECTIONAL POLICY RESEARCH AND INTERNAL OVERSIGHT FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. IT IS THE ARTS REQUESTING FUNDING AND POSITIONS TO RESTRUCTURE THE DEPARTMENT STAFF MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS SCREENING REFERRAL INVESTIGATIVE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCESSES. THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN THIS REQUEST WILL ENABLE THE DEPARTMENTTO COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURE THE PROCESS FOR REVIEWING ALEX ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT INVOLVING AN INCARCERATED PERSON ARE PROBABLY. PREVIOUSLY AGREEMENTS WAS REVIEWED AT THE INSTITUTION FOR ALL OFFICE FOR OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE THE COMPLAINT ORIGINATED. IF IT WAS DETERMINED TO INVOLVE A COMPLAINT AGAINST STAFF IT WAS SENT TO THE LOCAL HIRING AUTHORITY GENERALLY THE HIGHEST RANKING PERSON WITHIN THE STAFF MEMBERS PROGRAMMER DIVISION. NOW THE REVIEW OF ALLEGATIONS MADE BY INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND PAROLEES FROM THE INSTITUTION CENTRAL OFFICES. WILL BE TRANSFERRED FROM WHERE THEY ORIGINATED TO A CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM BUT THEN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AT CDC OUR HEADQUARTERS. THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM REPLACES THE SCREENING OF GRIEVANCES BY INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES AND CENTRALIZES THAT SCREENING IN ONE OFFICE FOR ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY. AS WELL AS REMOVE ANY ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED LOCAL FIRE BUT ELIMINATING THE ABILITY OF INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES TO REMOVE GRIEVANCES FROM THE REVIEW PROCESS. ALL INSTITUTIONS CENTRAL OFFICES WILL ROUTE GRIEVANCES AND COMPLAINTS TO THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIVING THE GRIEVANCE OR COMPLAINT. THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM IS TASKED WITH REVIEWING THE COMPLAINT AND DETERMINING WHETHER IT INCLUDES. AN ALLOCATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND IF SO WHETHER THAT SHOULD BE REVIEWED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH AN ALLEGATION INQUIRY REFERRED OUR Y. A FOR A CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION. TO ASSESS THE CENTRALIZED GRADING TEAM WITH THEIR DECISION MAKING THE NEW PROCESS ALSO INCLUDES A NEWLY CREATED ALLOCATION DECISION INDEX THAT WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHEN A COMPLAINT WILL BE ROUTED. TO A WHITE APRON DESTINATION. WELL EACH COMPLAINT WILL BE INVESTIGATED THE ALLEGATION DECISION INDEX SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES THE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS THAT WILL ALWAYS BE REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR INVESTIGATION. INCLUDING ALL ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT INVOLVING STAFF USE OF FORCE. AND ALL ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TOWARDS AN INCARCERATED PERSON- PROLATE ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING DISHONESTY DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT RETALIATION CODE OF SILENCE AND INTEGRITY MATTERS SUCH AS FAILING TO STOP MISCONDUCT BY ANOTHER EMPLOYEE. WHEN AN ALLEGATION IS NOT INCLUDED ON THE ALLOCATION DECISIONS AND ACTS IT WILL GENERALLY BE REFERRED TO THE LOCAL HIRING AUTHORITY FOR AN ALLEGATION INQUIRY HOWEVER THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM CAN STILL REFERRED THE ALLEGATION TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS. IF THEY DETERMINE THAT BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION BY- I A IS MORE APPROPRIATE. STAFF MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE ROUTED TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS WILL RECEIVE A FULL INVESTIGATION AND WILL NOT BE FORWARDED TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY UNTIL MANAGER HAS DETERMINED THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT IS THOROUGH. COMPLETE AND UNBIASED. LIKEWISE STAFF MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE ROUTED TO THE INSTITUTION OR PAROLE REGION FOR AN ALLEGATION ENCOURAGE INQUIRY. WILL ALSO HAVE TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS MANAGER BEFORE THEY ARE FORWARDED TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY ENSURING THE WORK BY THE LOCALLY DESIGNATED INVESTIGATOR IS ALSO THOROUGH. COMPLETE AND UNBIASED. THESE EFFORTS COUPLED WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS AND CHANGES REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT STEPS IN OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BYLER FROM THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS AND KIMBERLY SEIPEL FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU DO WE HAVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE HERE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM EMERY THING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S PROCESS FOR MONITORING- STAFF COMPLAINTS I'M IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN THE DEPARTMENT BEGAN DEVELOPING A PROCESS TO ADJUST ADDRESS INCARCERATED PERSONS COMPLAINTS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. THE O. I. G. GAINES ADDED RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE CONTEMPORANEA OVERSIGHT OF THAT PROCESS. THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED A PROCESS- WHICH WAS THE CREATION OF THE ALLEGATIONS INQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION ALSO CALLED AIMS- A UNIT THAT WAS DEDICATED TO CONDUCTING ENQUIRIES INTO ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. IN RESPONSE THE- I. T. CREATED A TEAM OF FIVE STAFF MEMBERS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE IN KIRBY'S CONDUCTED BY GAINES. SINCE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY UNTIL NOW OUR TEAM OF FIVE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENTS PROCESS FOR REVIEWING AND INVESTIGATING INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. WE USE A COMBINATION OF IN PERSON AND REMOTE MONITORING TOOK OVER CD GAMES AND CURRIES. AND WE ALSO COLLECT- DATA AND ANALYZE VARIOUS STAFF COMPLAINT DATA POINTS INCLUDING WORKLOAD STATISTICS AND THOSE COMPLAINTS REFERRED TO AIMS BY THE PRESENTS DEPARTMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED NEW REGULATIONS IT IS OUR PROPOSAL TO MONITOR THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR NEW REGULATIONS ON THEIR NEW STAFF COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION PROCESS MONITOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE DECISIONS THAT WILL BE MADE BY THEIR NEW A CENTER LIKE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM. TO INSURE THE FACT TEAM IS MAKING CONSISTENT DECISIONS IN THEIR REFERRALS TWO CASES THAT WILL GO TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR TO THE LOCALLY DESIGNATED INVESTIGATORS WE ARE ALSO ASKING FOR STAFF TO MONITOR WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT'S NEWLY CREATED. ALLEGATIONS INVESTIGATION UNIT AND WE INTEND TO MONITOR THOSE INVESTIGATIONS TO ENSURE THOROUGH COMPLETE AND UNBIASED INVESTIGATIONS WE WILL ASSESS THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND THEN WE WILL ALSO WORK ON A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH TIMELY FEEDBACK AND TO ISSUE PUBLIC REPORTS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. AND WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. L. A. L.'S OFFICE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL- THE CDC ARE PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT A NEW STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS IN LINE WITH THE NEW REGULATIONS APPEARS REASONABLE I'M HOWEVER WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSED LEVEL OF MONITORING OF THAT NEW PROCESS BY THE O. I. G. MAY NOT BE LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS FOR OVERSIGHT- SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE ITS SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS FOR OVERSIGHT OF THIS NEW STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS AND THEN ONLINE B. O. I. G. RESOURCES ACCORDINGLY. AND TO ASSIST THE LEGISLATURE IN THINKING ABOUT ITS EXPECTATIONS FOR OVERSIGHT WE PROVIDE- THREE KEY QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION WHICH ARE ONE SHOULD THE O. I. G. MONITOR THE SCREENING OF ALL TYPES OF COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY TE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM OR JUST- REGULAR GRIEVANCES AS IS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. TWO SHOULD BE- I JIM A LARGER PORTION OF INVESTIGATIONS- BENNETT'S PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY THAT PROPOSAL PER- WOULD UNDER THE PROPOSAL OR YOU WOULD MONITOR 10% OF INVESTIGATIONS- IN COMPARISON UNDER EXISTING PROCESS FOR HANDLING. ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE REFERRED BY WARDENS ANOTHER HIRING AUTHORITIES ALLEGING MONITORS ABOUT 15% OF INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN THIRD IT SHOULD- I. G. MONITOR THE QUALITY OF LOCAL ENQUIRY REPORTS- AND UNDER THE PROPOSAL- UNDER THE TWO PROPOSALS. AT CDCR STAFF WOULD MONITOR 100% OF THE QUALITY OF THOSE- LOCAL AND GREATER UP ROUGHLY THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND ANNUAL- REPORTS CONDUCTED BY PRISON AND PAROLE STAFF- AND AVOID YOU WOULD NOT MONITOR ANY OF THEM- AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD LIKE- I. G. TO MONITOR. A PORTION OF THAT IS- THOSE REPORTS ARE IN PART THEMSELVES. AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS MAYBE THAT I'M TERRIFIED ME. HI THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE JUST WANTED TO REGISTER A COUPLE OF COMMENTS IF THAT'S OKAY. YES FRANKLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE DEMONSTRATION WAS IN THE PROCESS OF EXPLORING VARIOUS OPTIONS. IT MAY BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE SPRING THIS INCLUDES CONCERNED RESOURCES AS IT RELATES TO OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL INCREASE THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR THE O. I. G. TO MONITOR APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT OR ROUGHLY A HUNDRED FORTY OUT OF EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED INVESTIGATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL WAS AIMED AT PROVIDING THOUGH I G. WITH RESOURCES TO OVERSEE THE MOST SERIOUS AND COMPLEX CASES BASED ON THE ALLEGATION DECISION INDEX THOSE INCORPORATED INTO CITY SEWERS REGULATIONS. AS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CAN SPEAK TO THE 10% IS A MEANINGFUL SAMPLE SIZE THAT ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF ALLEGATIONS- THE ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT WILL BE INVESTIGATING WHILE PROVIDING THE O. I. G. WITH THE ABILITY TO OVERSEE THE MOST SERIOUS CASES THIS LEVEL OF MONITORING ALSO RECOGNIZES THE MANY IMPROVEMENTS SEE THIS YEAR HAS MADE TO ITS STAFF MISCONDUCT PROCESS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS PROPOSAL OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. AS WE WORK THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE 10% SAID IN A LITTLE BIT BUT- CAN WE GO BACK TO- THE 280% OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PRESENT- THEY'RE STILL MISCONDUCT WITHIN THOSE 80% THAT NEED TO BE. INVESTIGATED AND IF SUBSTANTIATED THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE PROCESS GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT FOR THAT 80% AND EXILED QATARI DOING THAT DIFFERENTLY THAN BEFORE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION MADAM CHAIR AND SO I AS MENTIONED IT IN MY INTRODUCTION WE ABSOLUTELY ARE GOING TO TREAT THOSE DIFFERENTLY THAN WE USED TO SO AT THE DEPARTMENT WE MADE THE DECISION TO REALLY BROADEN THE DEFINITION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND IN THAT WE'VE REALLY COVERED EVERYTHING FROM FROM THE LEAST AREAS TO THE MOST SERIOUS IN THAT THE DEFINITION. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS A VAST AMOUNT OF CONCERN WITH THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE LOCALLY WE'VE ELECTED TO CHANGE OUR PROCESS SO THAT EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS LESS SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS ARE GOING BACK TO THE INSTITUTIONS. THEY WILL HAVE TO BE REVIEWED BY A MANAGER IN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND IT THIS WILL BE THE SAME MANAGERS BY THE WAY THAT ARE ALSO REVIEWING THE WORK BEING DONE BY THE ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE REPORTS AND DETERMINE IF THEY ARE THOROUGH COMPLETE AND UNBIASED NO DIFFERENT THAN THE SAME PER VIEW THAT THEY'RE DOING FOR THE INVESTIGATIONS BEING DONE BY THEIR TEAM WE REALLY FEEL THAT THIS WILL MITIGATE THE CONCERNS OF- WORK QUALITY FROM THE INSTITUTION LEVEL AND GIVE US A BETTER OUTCOME OVERALL. AND THEN AM I AM I CORRECT AGAIN TO THE CITY OUR- AM I CORRECT THAT IT'S THE WARDENS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE FINAL DETERMINATION THAT STAFF MISCONDUCT OCCUR OR DID OCCUR. THAT IS CORRECT AND SO WHAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT THAT WE HAVE OVER THESE WARDENS AND HOW BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY DIFFERENT THAN. THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM THAT WAS FAILING MATH. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION IN OUR NEW PROCESS WE HAVE NOW ADDED IN OVERSIGHT BY OUR OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS IN OUR ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT WHICH MEANS MORE. OF THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE GOING TO BE AIMS UNIT FOR AN INQUIRY THERE WAS NO OVERSIGHT BY OUR LEGAL TEAM. NOW WE WILL HAVE INCORPORATED IN THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS INTO THAT PROCESS. AND SO THEY AS THEY MONITOR THESE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS FOR THOSE THAT THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN. THEY OF COURSE FOLLOW THAT CASE ALL THE WAY TO THE TO THE INSTITUTION- TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY DECISIONS AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY DURING THAT PROCESS IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THE HIRING AUTHORITY. TO ELEVATE THAT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AT FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEW AND SO WE'VE WE'VE INCORPORATED THEM INTO THAT PROCESS- FOR ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE INSTITUTIONS. THEY'RE INCORPORATED INTO THE PROCESS FOR THAT 20% AND THE 80% OR JUST FOR THE 20% THAT IT YOU'RE CORRECT IN THATFOR THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS WE'VE INCORPORATED THEM INTO THE- OUR CLAIMS THE STAFF MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO GO TO A LIGHT A FOR INVESTIGATION THEY ARE NOT. ATTACHED TO THE INSTITUTIONS ALLEGATION INQUIRY PROCESS IN LAST WHEN IT IS REVIEWED BY THE- OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS MANAGER THAT MANAGER MAKES THE DECISION THAT THAT PARTICULAR INQUIRY NEEDS ADDITIONAL WORK AT BY AN INVESTIGATOR AND THEREFORE WOULD ENTERED INTO THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS AT WHICH POINT. AT OUR LEGAL TEAM AND ATTACH THAT. SO. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE MADE SOME PROGRESS MAYBE IN THE FRONT END OF THINGS BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'VE MADE PROGRESS ON THE BACK END OF THINGS I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT'S GOING TO RESULT IN ANY REAL CHANGES TO THE QUARTER INTO THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE ARE. TRYING TO CREATE HERE. IN ORDER AND SO I KNOW WHAT YOU JUST ANSWERED ME BUT IF I TRANSLATE WHAT I HEARD IS THAT'S WHAT I HEARD THE DO YOU. I'M JUST RAY THAT WE'RE GONNA DO A LOT TO WORK THAT'S PRODUCTIVE AND REFORMING THE PROCESS AT THE FRONT BUT A WIN AT THE END OF THE BED AT THE BACK AND HAVEN'T REALLY DONE ANYTHING. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THAT QUESTION. MAYBE IT'S A BETTER ANSWER THE QUESTION UP THOUGH THE ROLE THAT LEGAL AFFAIRS HAS IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS- INCLUDING THE OVERSIGHT FOR DECISIONS MADE BY HER. PARTY'S I'M I. WOULD LIKE TO PASS ON. PASS IT OVER TO LEGAL AFFAIRS CHRIS THE DONE FILER OR- OR JENNIFER NEIL SET MAYBE PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION. AND ACTUALLY MAYBE IF SOMETHING WERE GONNA SINGLE FIRST RIVER MORE INFORMATION AND THEY CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE I HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WARD AND- THERE WERE. WE HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE WATER ORTON SINCE THEY GET TO MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KRISTA THAT'S WHETHER I'M THAT CHICK THAT THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS EMPLOYMENT ADVOCACY OF PROSECUTION TEAM. I THINK I'M SORRY CAN YOU SPEAK UP OR MAYBE GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE. I WILL TRY TO MOVE CLOSER AND SPEAK UP AT THE SAME TIME. I CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES THANK YOU. AT EIGHT I THINK THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF. ISSUES THAT YOU'VE RAISED WHERE ARE YOUR QUESTION AND HOPEFULLY I'LL I'LL GET. AT ALL ASPECTS ANSWERED- FIRST WITH REGARD TO THE OVERSIGHT- M. B. I HAVE. WORKED WITH THE HIRING AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING CENTER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE. I'M PART OF EQT'S ROLE IS TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED DURING THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION. AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. SHOULD BE SUSTAINED OR NOT. I EXISTING. WHICH WILL CARRY OVER INTO THE NEW PROCESS SHOULD HIRING AUTHORITY ACT IN A MANNER THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR POLICIES AND OUR PRACTICES. THE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR SUPERVISORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ELEVATE THE HIRING AUTHORITIES THE WARDENS OR CVS DECISION. TO THE NEXT HIGHEST LEVEL. AND SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FURTHER REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION. OF ANY ISSUES WHERE IT PTC'S I HAVE A DENTAL PROBLEM WITH HELLO- WHARTON OR CEO IS IMPOSING DISCIPLINE OR SUSTAINING ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT THE SAME ALLEGATIONS. I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER BENEFITS TO THIS NEW PROCESS AND IN TERMS OF HELPING WITH THIS THE PLAN AND THAT PROCESS AND WHETHER OR NOT WATER SUSTAINING ALLEGATIONS. IS THAT WITH MORE INFORMATION COMES MORE CONFIDENT IN MAKING A DECISION FOR THE HIRING AUTHORITY FOR THE WORKING SO BECAUSE SO MANY MORE OF THESE CASES WILL BE INVESTIGATED THE ONLY BE WARDENS WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION UPON WHICH THEY CAN ACT. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE I'M ORGANISTS LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT ON ADDRESSING DISCIPLINARY MATTERS AND ADDRESSING MISCONDUCT BECAUSE THE WARDENS AND THE CEOS WILL HAVE ALL OF THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OR NOT SUSTAIN AN ALLEGATION BECAUSE THE CASE WILL HAVE AN INVESTIGATIVE. BY AN INVESTIGATOR. SO I AT THIS WILL BE MY LAST COMMENT ACTUALLY IS NOT A QUESTION FAILING TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO I KNOW ARE CHOMPING AT THE BIT FOR QUESTIONS. LET ME JUST SAY THAT HAPPY MORE INFORMATION. IS NOT ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE CHANGING THE CULTURE A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT OVER TIME HAS BEEN ABOUT THE CULTURE AND HE'S TO BE CHANGED. I AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT. THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AND PROCESS- IS ACTUALLY REFORM. AS WELL AND SO I WOULD JUST F. AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE MAY REVISE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS THERE TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE- THAT THAT WE'RE DOING GOOD WORK AT THE FINANCE AND THE BACKEND AND BOTH FOR THE 20% AND 80% OUT THERE NOT JUST NOT JUST FOR SOME OUT THERE AND SO EIGHT WHILE I KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE HAPPY WHAT I HAVE SEEN IS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM WE HAD SEEN LAST YEAR I DO THINK WE NEED TO WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTION AT THE THAT. THE BACK AND- IT. IS ACTUALLY STARTING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AMONGST. AMONGST INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE. AND INFORMATION ALONE DOES NOT CONVINCE ME THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. AND SO MISTER LUCKY. YEAH I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT THE- ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME I'M I WORK FOR AN AGENCY THAT I ACTUALLY HAD A COMPLAINT PROCESS AND I'VE IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR TO ME THAT FIRST OF ALL MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE. WENT WENT CONCERT WHEN THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM- MAKES A REFERRAL TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. IS THEIR CRITERIA BASED ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF ALLEGATIONS OR THE EVIDENTIARY. VALIDITY OF THE COMPLAINT. THOSE ARE TWO VERY SEPARATE. CONSIDERATIONS. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR THAT QUESTION SO IN OUR OLD PROCESS WE ABSOLUTELY I USED- BEING THE ABILITY OF EVIDENCE AS PART OF THE CRITERIA TO SEND AN ALLEGATION TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IN OUR NEW PROCESS WE WILL NO LONGER DO THAT INSTEAD WE HAVE A THE WHAT WE CALL THE ALLEGATION DECISION INDEX IT IS A VERY. A SPECIFIC LIST OF THE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS THAT NO MATTER WHAT WE'LL GO TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS BASED ON THE ALLEGATION AND NOT NECESSARILY BASED ON ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES OR DOES NOT EXIST AT THE TIME. WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE AND IDENTIFIED THOSE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS AS THE MOST SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND RECOGNIZE THAT HAVING THEM BE INVESTIGATED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT'S CRUCIAL THE POTENTIALLY PRESERVING ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT EXIST AND ALSO GETTING TO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MATTER AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IF YOU WELL. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Q. MY NEXT WOULD BE WHAT WHEN DETERMINING A FINDING FOR THE PARTICULAR COMPLAINT WHAT EVIDENTIARY CRITERIA HAS TO BE MET THERE'S A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE. OR IS IT. NO IN OUR DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN AN ALLEGATION WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND FIND IT MY LAST QUESTION HAS TO DO IS HOW IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS OF THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL PLANS TO REVIEW ESTABLISHED THAT YOU HAVE A THIRTY PERCENT. OF THAT BASED ON YOUR MANPOWER IS IT BASED ON SOME OTHER CRITERIA. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AMRIK SINGH INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE 30% IS A NUMBER THAT WE DETERMINED IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE BASED ON THE HIGH VOLUME OF- CLEANS OR- GRIEVANCES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPARTMENT- WE BELIEVE THAT THIRTY PERCENT. WOULD GIVE US A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL NUMBER OF. CLEANS THAT WILL BE SUBMITTED- BASICALLY 830% WE THOUGHT WAS A REASONABLE- NUMBER FOUR STAFF TO REVIEW IT WOULD GIVE US GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE TOTAL NUMBER. AND IT WOULD GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE REASONABLE AND- RELEVANT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THEIR PROCESS THEN AS FAR AS IRIS. BUT AND THANK YOU FOR THIS BECAUSE I'M I'M ONE OF THE ONES. THAT REALLY WANTED TO- PROVIDE THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL- MORE RESOURCES- SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT- AND WE WANTED. TO MONITOR ALL TYPES OF CLAIMS. IT WAS THAT SIMPLE. INSTEAD I'M LOOKING AT AN ALPHABET SOUP OF BUREAUCRACY. THE LITTLE LOCAL DESIGNATED UNION LDO TO CENTRALIZE SCREENING TEAM CST THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS- LA THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS- I A THE ALLEGATIONS INVESTIGATION UNIT A. I. YOU AN ALLEGATION DISSENSION INDEX A. B. I. I'M A DEMOCRAT I WOULD EVEN WANT THIS MUCH BUREAUCRACY IN THE PINK I DO. HOW DO YOU GET ANYTHING DONE. WITH THIS BUREAU MUCH BRACKET C. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU STILL HAVE THE WARDENS HAVING SOME IMPACT. INTO THIS WHICH WAS THE CENTRAL PROBLEM BEFORE. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LIGHTS I'M LIKE YOU KNOW NOW. ALL THE LEGISLATURE WANTED WAS FOR THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL TO HAVE MORE MONEY RESOURCES AND POWER. TO OVERSIGHT THIS WHOLE DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM THAT'S IT WHAT YOU'VE CREATED INTERNALLY EXACERBATE THE WHOLE PROBLEM AND FURTHER MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE O. I. G. TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. AND SO I AGREE YOU NEED TO GO BACK. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE RESOURCES TO THE OFFICE INSPECTOR GENERAL SO THAT% THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN DO THE JOB TO REPORT BACK TO THIS BODY IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHITE BEANS CAN AND CANNOT BE DONE SO WE CAN MAKE THE APPROPRIATE- BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS OR ENDORSED LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS. TO HELP IMPROVE C. D. C. R. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. ANYBODY HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ALPHABET SOUP WITH DANGER WHY THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIRE BY MAY I CAN APPRECIATE ABSOLUTELY THEY CONCERNED WITH WITH- THE PROCESS AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES GO THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT STEPS IN ORDER TO BE COMPLETED BUT I ALSO CAN TELL YOU IN IN LOOKING AT OUR PROCESS AND WORKING THROUGH IT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THAT WHAT WE'VE SET UP NOW REALLY DOES REMOVE A LOT OF BE. PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL BIAS THAT EXISTED PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD GO TO A Y. EIGHT RESTED WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES I BELIEVE THAT OUR CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM BEING A VERY INDEPENDENT UNIT PART OF OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WHEN THEY DECIDE THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT BURIED DIRECTLY THEN HAND IT OFF TO THEIR PARTNERS IN THE INVESTIGATION UNIT. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE CHANGES. IN OUR PROCESS WE ARE ALSO WE HAVE ALSO STOOD UP ONE CENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT TRACKS EVERY SINGLE ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT FROM THE TIME THAT IT'S MADE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE COMPLETION. OF ANY DISCIPLINE AND IF IT IF DISCIPLINE IS TAKEN AND SO WE WILL NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO STATEWIDE EVALUATE THAT DATA. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE THAT DATA TO ESTABLISH WHAT WE ARE REFERRING TO AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. SO THAT ANY KIND OF CONCERNING TRENDS OUR SITUATION WHETHER IT'S A STAFF MEMBER WITH THE PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW NUMEROUS NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS A LOCATION THAT HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT EARLY WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT EARLY- AND GET. GET PROCESSES IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY AND FIX WHAT'S WRONG SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW PROCESS HAT WE'VE SET UP AND WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOING TO ESTABLISH A MUCH. BETTER PROCESS THAT WILL IMPROVE TRANSFER CURRENCY AND IMPROVE THE CARE. IN OUR AGE. SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND DEFERENCE- I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE O. I. G. AND IF YOU WANT TO PUT IN THIS SET SYSTEM WHICH IS MORE LIKE IN ALICE'S PARALYSIS. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMEBODY'S GONNA BE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING EVALUATED HONESTLY NOT PART OF THE SYSTEM. YOU HAVE AN OFFICE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND YOU CREATED. A CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM TO WATCH THE OFFICE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHEN YOU ALSO HAVE AN OFFICE- INTERNAL AFFAIRS. I'M SO CONFUSED. HOW ARE YOU EVER GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE WITH THIS MANY LAYERS AND SO I AM BACK TO ALL WE NEEDED WAS TO BOLSTER THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL WE CAN TRY THIS BUT WE STILL NEED THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL TO TELL YOU TELL US HOW YOU REALLY DOING THAT HOW YOU COME BACK TO US AND TELL US HOW YOU PERCEIVE YOUR DOING BUT HOW IT'S REALLY DONE AND YOU NEED TO HAVEN'T SOMEONE LOOKING AT YOU HONESTLY AND OPENLY TO GIVE US THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED HERE. THANK. AT OUR SHARE ALLEN MY CONCERNS WITH MY WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES IN THE CHAIR AND THAT THIS IS THE FOR ME IT SEEMS ANYTHING BUT SIMPLE A WE'RE LOOKING FOR STREAMLINED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I AM NOT CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE SERVE YOU'RE CONFIDENT- I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD ON IT FOR NOW BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE. TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY- FOR BUT FOR SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY I KEEP ON HEARING THIS WHAT IS THAT THE NEXT LEVEL UNTIL THE NEXT LEVEL I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE NEXT LEVEL MEANS. I'M SORRY- THAT THAT ANY MILLER I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NEXT LEVEL GAMES EITHER. WE'RE ALL CONFUSED. UP THROUGH TO JUST FALL THIS LINEAGE HERE IF THERE IS WHETHER IT IS IN- DURING OUR AN AUDITING OF A REVIEW OF THE STAFF COMPLAINTS OR THE STAFF MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. I'M ONE SOMETHING IS IDENTIFIED- ULTIMATELY THE WARD AND MAKES A DECISION- BUT I KEEP ON GETTING THIS- WORD SALAD OF- THE NEXT LEVEL AND I JUST I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. THANK YOU THANK YOU AYE I BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. SO WHEN THE HIRING AUTHORITY HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO SUSTAIN ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. IF DURING THAT PROCESS- AND IFIT'S BEING MONITORED BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OR IF IT'S A- HAS. OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS MONITORING THE CASE IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THAT DECISION BEING MADE BY THE HIRING AUTHORITY THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ELEVATE IT. TO THAT NEXT ARE THAT BAD SUPERVISOR IF YOU WILL TO THE HIRING AUTHORITIES SO IN THIS CASE IT'S OFTEN ELEVATED TO AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR WITH THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS WHO SUPERVISES THE WARDENS. AND THEN ON THE LEGAL AFFAIRS SIDE THEY ALSO ELEVATED UP TO THEIR SUPERVISOR. TO REEVALUATE THE CASE AND TO DETERMINE IF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE WERE APPROPRIATE OR THE DECISION SHOULD BE CHANGED WE CALLED EXECUTIVE REVIEW- AND SO THAT'S THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. TO WHEN. WHEN A CASE THAT WHEN A DECISION MADE BY HER AND THE FORTY. ODD IS NOT MUTUALLY. AGREED TO AMONG THOSE MONITORING THE PROCESS. OKAY SO A LITTLE MORE CLARITY THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. I MEAN I GUESS I WOULD SAY THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE THAT SKEPTICAL OF CREATING MORE LEVELS WITHIN AN AGENCY THAT WE'VE LOST TRUST AND TO MONITOR AND GET THIS RIGHT AND CHANGE THE CULTURE AND SO DOES HE KEEP HEARING QUESTIONS AND DOUBTS AND US AND I THINK THE QUESTION COMES DOWN TO WHY CREATE A LEGAL AFFAIRS WITHIN THE AGENCY VERSUS JUST HANDING STUFF OVER TO THE I. O. G. AND SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T ANSWER THAT AS YOU. AS YOU APPROACH THEM A REVISED I THINK YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THAT'S WITH COFFEE RUNNING THROUGH OUR HEAD- AND SO YOU'RE WELCOME TO SPEAK NOW ORGAN MAY COME BACK AT AND WE CAN ONCE THE NEXT ITEM BUT THAT I DID FLOOR STARTING TO RUN IN CIRCLES BUT I THINK I SUMMARIZED MY PROVIDING THE CIRCLES ARE. THE MAN CARE. MMHM YES MA'AM FOR A MOMENT HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER NEAL AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY LEGAL AFFAIRS AND CHIEF COUNSEL. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES BETWEEN IN HOUSE COUNSEL FOR THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS SERVES AS LEGAL COUNSEL. FOR THE AGENCIES EXECUTIVES ITS EMPLOYEES. AND NOT PROSECUTING STAFF MISCONDUCT INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS AN OVERSIGHT ROLE OVER THE DEPARTMENT AND MONITOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF. OUR INVESTIGATIONS AND DISCIPLINE SO WE DO SERVE TWO DIFFERENT ROLES WITHIN THE PROCESS. I GET THAT WERE JUST SAYING WHY ARE WE NOT HANDING OVER MORE INVESTIGATION POWER TO THE O. I. G. BECAUSE WE'VE LOST FAITH THAT AND IN THIS DEPARTMENT AND ADDING EXTRA LAYER SOMETHING CONVINCED US YET SO THAT'S- THAT'S THE LITANY OF QUESTIONS ARE GETTING AT THE END OF THE DAY. SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON SAID I WANT TO CONTINUE IN. AND THE ORDER AND THE AGE AND THEN YOU COULD JUST GO ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND NOW WAIT FOR MY PROMPT. GOOD AFTERNOON MARIE THING INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE PROPOSAL FOR THE MEDICAL INSPECTION UNIT- D. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS- GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY TO OBJECTIVELY- ARE.

AND WE ARE REQUESTING AN R. PROPOSAL AN ADDITIONAL- FUNDING AMOUNTS TO HIRE EIGHTEEN POSITIONS THESE POSITIONS WILL HELP OUR CREATE- HELP US CONDUCT OUR CYCLES IN A QUICKER FASHION OUR OUR MEDICAL INSPECTION UNIT CURRENTLY COLLECTS DATA- FROM THE INSTITUTIONS AND WITH THAT DATA WE CREATE A SAMPLE. THEN CONDUCT CLINICAL CASE REVIEWS SHOULD ENSURE THAT CARE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS WE ALSO CONDUCT COMPLIANCE REVIEW OF DOCUMENTATION- TO ENSURE THE CARE IS CONSISTENT WITH DEPARTMENT POLICY WE CONDUCT ON SITE TESTING AND THE PROVISION OF CARE AND THEN WE TAKE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WE REVIEW IT ENSURE ACCURACY AND WRITE REPORTS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN SINCE THE MEDICAL INSPECTION UNIT DI CAME INTO BEING ON THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL CARE THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL THEY HAVE INCREASED A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS SUCH AS THERE ARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS. I HEPATITIS C. PROGRAMS. THERE'S BEEN SOME- TELEHEALTH TELL US HEALTH TELLING. IMPLEMENT AND THEREFORE WE ARE ASKING FOR THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS SO THAT WE CAN CREATE- WE CAN. CONDUCT OUR MEDICAL INSPECTIONS IN A QUICKER FASHION AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE REPORTS FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS I HAVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY IN TWO YEARS AND NOT THREE TO THREE AND A HALF YEARS.

IS THAT THE ORIGINAL OR IDEAS FOR BOTH-OF US THAT YOUR PROPOSAL AND I'M ASKING THIS I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HIRE AND- RETAIN PROFESSIONALS WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THE FUNDING THIS LIMITED. A BRAND COULD BE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE MINISTRATION CONSIDERS EACH PROPOSAL IN ITS UNIQUE CONTACTS AND BASED ON THE DATA SAID AVAILABLE- WITH THE SPECIFIC REQUEST IT WAS BASED ON DATA COLLECTED FOR ROUGHLY A THIRD OF THE- INSPECTIONS FOR A RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE OF. A THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS AND COUPLED WITH THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING MEDICAL INSPECTIONS ARE RELEASING REPORTS THEY'RE IN THE MIDST. OF THE PANDEMIC DEMONSTRATION FOUND THAT- IT IS THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS TO FUND AT THE POSITIONS FOR THREE YEARS UNTIL A MORE COMPLETE DATA CENTERS BAILABLE. THIS IS ALICE HEWITT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST TO STATE THAT THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND SO INSPECTOR GENERAL SAYING. AS WELL CAN SPEAK TO THIS BUT IT WAS ESSENTIALLY WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WHICH IS SPEEDING UP THE MEDICAL INSPECTION CYCLE WE JUST DON'T HAVE A GREAT DAY TO SET TO DO IT AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES IN THE NEAR TERM.
