TIM IS CALDERON. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR GERMAN IN MEMORY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF GLORIA RENDON. SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF LOS ANGELES BORN THERE ON FEBRUARY FIRST NINETEEN FORTY TWO. VIRTUALLY FROM HER BIRTH SHE WAS A DIE HARD DODGER FAN. AND A LOYAL BRUEN. LAST MONTH SHE STAY GLUED TO YOUR SEAT FOR SIX HOURS AT THE DODGERS BATTLED THE PADRES FOR SIXTEEN INNINGS TO WIN THE GAME. SHE WAS ALSO A DEVOTED UCLA BASKETBALL FAN FROM THE GLORY DAYS OF JOHN WOODEN. BRUINS TO THE TEAM'S FINAL FOUR LAST SPRING WHEN UCLA BECAME ONE OF THE ONLY TEAMS TO GO FROM FIRST FOUR TO FINAL FOR AN ALMOST UPSET THE TOP SEEDED GONZAGA BULLDOGS. HERFATHER DIED WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG AND THEY GAVE HER TOUGHNESS AND- DAY SHE CARRIED WITH HER THROUGHOUT HER LIFE. GLORIA WAS ALWAYS KIND SELFLESS GENEROUS AND CONSIDERATE. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REMARKABLY STRONG AND UNFLAPPABLE IN TIMES OF CRISIS. GLORIA ALWAYS FOUGHT FOR OTHERS AS MUCH AS SHE FOUGHT FOR HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN. IF A WORKER WAS MISTREATED IN HER PRESENCE. SHE WOULD STAND UP TO STRANGERS AND CALL THEM ON IT FOR BEING RUDE. KEEP IN MIND SHE WAS ONLY FIVE FEET TALL BUT SHE WAS AS FIERCE AND TENACIOUS AS ANYONE TWICE HER SIZE WHEN IT CAME TO HOW MUCH YOU VALUE DECENCY AND KINDNESS. SHE TAUGHT HER CHILDREN TO STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES. REMINDING HER DAUGHTERS IN PARTICULAR TO NEVER ALLOW ANYONE TO BE A LITTLE BE RATE FOR DISRESPECT THEM. GLORIA HAD NO PATIENT FOR RACISTS MISOGYNISTS AND HOMOPHOBES AND STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND POLITICIANS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS WHO BUILT PLATFORMS BASED ON HATE AND XENOPHOBIA. SHE BELIEVED EVERYONE HAD A RIGHT TO MARRY WHOMEVER THEY LOVED. ONCE ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS YOUNG BEST FRIENDS CONFIDED IN GLORIA HE WAS GAY BEFORE HE EVEN TOLD HIS OWN PARENTS. SHE RESPONDED BY ASSURING HIM SHE WAS CONFIDENT HIS PARENTS WOULD BE AFFECTING OF HIM BUT IF NOT SHE WOULD ADOPT THEM. NOTHING DEFINED GLORIA MORE THAN A LOVE AND DEVOTION SHE HAD FOR HER FAMILY. SHE MARRIED THE LOVE OF HER LIFE TOM RENDON IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. THIS MONTH THEY WERE TO CELEBRATE THEIR FIFTY SEVENTH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY AND TOM HAD SECRETLY MADE TRAVEL PLANS. AFTER ALL THE YEARS THEY WERE STILL MADLY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER THEY HELD HANDS CONSTANTLY. THEY COMMONLY SHOWED EXPRESSION OF THEIR LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER. THE DAY BEFORE HER SUDDEN PASSING TOM TOLD GLORIA HOW FORTUNATE HE WAS THAT IT OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM. HOURS BEFORE HER HEART ATTACK HE BOUGHT HER TWO DOZEN RED ROSES. EVERY MONDAY FOR THIRTY YEARS GLORIA COOK TO DINNER IN HER HOME FOR ALL OF HER FAMILY. ABOVE ALL ELSE IT WITH HER FAMILY THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD TO HER. IN HER HOUSE HE WERE CARED FOR FED AND PAMPERED. NONE OF IT EVER FELT LIKE SHE SAW IT AS HER DUTY. SHE SIMPLY DERIVED HER OWN HAPPINESS FROM THE HAPPINESS OF THOSE AROUND HER. SHE LOVED THE HOLIDAYS THE MOST BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT ALL HER LOVED ONES WOULD CRAM INTO HER HOUSE AND JUST ENJOY BEING TOGETHER. HER HEART WAS BIG ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE. SHE NEVER SAID NO TO ANY FAVOR ASKED OF HER BY ANYONE. SHE DID NOT SEE LIVE IS A FINITE RESOURCE TO BE PARCELED OUT AND CAREFULLY GUARDED SHE SO LOVED IS SOMETHING BIG GREW EXPONENTIALLY AS SHE WELCOMED FRIENDS FIANCE'S. IN LAWS AND GRANDCHILDREN. ANTHONY CHRISTINE AND LEAH SHE WAS OUR FIRST AND BEST TEACHER. SHE TAUGHT THEM TO VALUE OTHERS ABOVE ALL ELSE AND LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THEIR ACCOMPLISHED LIVES. SHE SPOKE TO HER CHILDREN EVERY DAY AND REASSURED THEM OF HER AND YOU'LL BE IN LOVE. SHE TOOK PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT HER CHILDREN WERE INDEPENDENT ADULTS. BUT NEVER STOPPED THINKING OF WAYS TO MAKE THEIR LIVES EASIER. SHE WAS A LOVING MOTHER IN LAW TO JEFF. JOSEPH PATRICK IN HANDING AND WELCOME TO ALL OF THEM AND TO HER FAMILY AS THOUGH THEY WERE HER OWN CHILDREN AND TREATED THEM AS SUCH. SHE AND TOM BECAME GRANDPARENTS TO SIX JOSHUA TIMOTHY ASHLEY THOMAS DEVIN AND VIENNA SHE WAS DEVOTED TO ALL OF THEM. SHE WAS NO STRANGER TO THESE CHAMBERS HAVING VISITED DOZENS OF TIMES. WHENEVER SHE DID SOMEONE WILL INEVITABLY ASK IF SHE WAS PROUD OF HER SON. HER ANSWER WAS THE SAME EACH TIME I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN AND I'M EQUALLY PROUD OF ALL OF THEM. ALTHOUGH SHE WAS PAINFULLY TAKEN AWAY LAST WEEK HER FAMILY IS ETERNALLY GRATEFUL THAT HER HUSBAND AND ALL HER CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO SAY GOODBYE. AND TELL HER ONE LAST TIME THAT THEY LOVED HER. LARA RENDON'S LOVE KINDNESS FAIRNESS SELFLESSNESS GENEROSITY DECENCY AND COURAGE WILL CONTINUE TO SHAPE CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE LIVES AND WORK OF HER FAMILY THAT SHE HELD SO DEAR MEMBERS PLEASE JOIN ME IN A JOURNEY IN MEMORY OF GLORY RENDON. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON. MS RADIUS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WAS MENTIONED TO BUY THIS CALDERON. GLORIA RENDON HAD A FAMILY WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVED HER WHO ADORED HER WHO LOOKED UP TO HER. SHE WAS THEIR MENTOR.
