TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR THAN FIVE THOUSAND SEPARATE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS SPECIFYING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR PENALTIES FOR CONVICTIONS ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS. AND CREDIT EARNING ONCE INCARCERATED.

TO STUDY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO REVISE THIS COMPLEX STATUTORY STRUCTURE. THE NEW COMMITTEE WILL HAVE SEPARATE POWERS FROM THE COMMISSION TO MAKE POLICIES AND TAKE ACTIONS INTERVIEW AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ON REVISIONS TO THE PENAL CODE. THE COMMITTEE WILL BEGIN AN EFFORT TO SIMPLIFY AND RATIONALIZE CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURES. ESTABLISHED ALTERNATIVES. TO INCARCERATION THAT AID REHABILITATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY. IMPROVE PAROLE AND PROBATION SYSTEMS AND ADJUST THE LENGTH OF CENTS TERMS BASED ON CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS.

WHICH IS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE YES. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN GOOD MORNING MOUNTAINS SAY THAT THOUGH [inaudible] I USED. IF YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT I THINK IT BACK. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CLARK KELSO ONE THE RECEIVER APPOINTED BY THE FEDERAL COURT IN THE PLOT A LITIGATION. I WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR CDC OURS MEDICAL PROGRAM -- I'LL PROVIDE JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL. DETAILS OF BACKGROUND THAT I KNOW THE COMMITTEE IS ALREADY WHERE UP -- OVERALL WE CONTINUE TO MAKE STEADY PROGRESS IN FULFILLING OUR MISSION. OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE THAT IS BEING DELIVERED TO OUR PATIENTS. AND ON AN INSTITUTION BY INSTITUTION BASIS. TRANSFERRING AUTHORITY OVER TO THE MEDICAL OVER THE MEDICAL PROGRAM BACK TO THE STATE. AS OF TODAY TWENTY FOUR OF CDC OUR THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTION THAT'S ABOUT 70%. HAVE EITHER BEEN DELEGATED BACK TO CDC ARM FOR ITS MANAGEMENT. OR RECEIVED A FINDING OF ACCEPTABLE CARE. FROM THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. THE ELEVEN REMAINING INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DELEGATED BACK TO THE STATE AND DO NOT HAVE A FINDING OF ADEQUATE CARE. ARE NOW MY PRIMARY FOCUS. I BELIEVE THAT A FEW OF THESE ELEVEN WELL FAIRLY EASILY BE FOUND ADEQUATE. IN THE NEXT ROUND OF REVIEWS BY THE O. I. G.. AND WILL THEN BE SUITABLE FOR DELEGATION BACK TO THE STATE. THAT IS GOING TO LEAVE US WITH A SMALL BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE FRANKLY. SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO MANAGE INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE. BOTH FOR MEDICAL I AM FOR MENTAL HEALTH -- IN FOR CUSTODY FRANKLY -- I CAN ASSURE THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER -- TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE IN THOSE MOST DIFFICULT INSTITUTIONS -- BUT I DON'T WANT TO PAINT TOO ROSY A PICTURE A GETTING TO THE FINISH LINE WITH THESE LAST INSTITUTIONS IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF HARD WORK. REQUIRING CLOSE COOPERATION WITH AND SUPPORT FROM SECRETARY DIAZ IN HIS CUSTODY RESOURCES. UNFORTUNATELY THE SECRETARY AND I AND OUR STAFFS WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER -- IN WE ARE JOINTLY COMMITTED TO GETTING THIS JOB DONE. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE TWO OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. OUR FIRST. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS OF SYSTEM. A MASS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT BEGUN A SHORT FIVE YEARS AGO. HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AT ALL INSTITUTIONS. OUR PATIENTS BENEFIT FROM THIS SYSTEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR MEDICAL RECORDS AND NOW FINALLY IN SUCH GOOD ORDER. THAT OUR PROVIDERS IN NURSES CAN EASILY TRACK EVERY PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY. SEE A MONITOR ALL TEST RESULTS PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS AND MONITOR THEIR ADMINISTRATION. IN AND PUT PROVIDER IN NURSING NOTES DOCUMENTING THE CARE THAT IS BEING DELIVERED. EQUALLY IMPORTANT MEDICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE INSTITUTIONAL AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND AT HEADQUARTERS ARE NOW ABLE TO MONITOR THE DELIVERY OF CARE IN A REAL TIME. AND WE HAVE DATA NOW -- THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US ABOUT THE WAY CARE IS BEING PROVIDED -- THAT THAT IS SIMPLY REMARKABLE AND THE WERE ABLE TO USE TO IMPROVE OUR QUALITY -- I WOULD NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS OVER THE LAST DECADE. A DECADE AND MAYBE TWELVE YEARS DOZEN YEARS. HAS ESSENTIALLY GONE FROM HAVING. ACTUALLY NO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS SUPPORTING ITS OPERATIONS. VERY RUDIMENTARY SYSTEMS ON CUSTODY SIDE AND NOT ON HEALTH CARE. TO HAVING SOME OF THE BEST IT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT EVERY LARGE I. T. PROGRAM IN THE STATE. OF FLOUNDERS OF CDC ARE ACTUALLY IS A A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A DEPARTMENT THAT HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED FROM PAPER TO A DIGITAL DEPARTMENT. MY SECOND. INITIATIVE BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT -- IS THAT AFTER SUBSTANTIAL INTERNAL OPERATION LAST YEAR I JOIN WITH UNDERSECRETARY DIANA TOSSED. IN DIRECTING OUR STAFFS TO DEVELOP A MEDICATION ASSISTED A TREATMENT PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITHIN CDC ARE WHO HAVE SUBSTANCE AND OR OPIOID USE DISORDERS. INITIALLY WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK FOR OVERDOSE. AS THE MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE NO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. IS A COMPLEX CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION -- IT INVOLVES DOPAMINE DYSREGULATION IN THE BRAIN THAT CONTROLS REWARD AND MOTIVATION. IT CAN LEAD TO UNCONTROLLABLE CRAVINGS CONTINUED SUBSTANCE USE. AND OTHER ABBERTON BEHAVIORS -- WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO PERMANENT DISABILITY PREMATURE DEATH. AND OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR AFFLICTED INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IN RECENT YEARS OPIOID USE DISORDER IS THE PRIMARY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN FATAL AND NONFATAL OVERDOSES NATIONALLY. IN CALIFORNIA. TAMBIÃ©N CDC ARE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE PREVALENCE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AMONG THE CDC OUR POPULATION IS APPROXIMATELY 80%. BUT A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND INMATES. AND THAT AT LEAST 26%. OF PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER HAVE AN OPIOID USE DISORDER. CURRENTLY THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATION OFFERS BEHAVIOR THERAPY USED AT ALL CDC OUR INSTITUTIONS. THROUGH VARIOUS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY SERVICES ARE BASED ON MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE WITH SPECIFIC GROUPS OF PATIENTS IN THE OUTSIDE COMMUNITY. THE RELIABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TREATMENTS WITHIN CDC ARE IS UNKNOWN. THE DATA JUST HASN'T BEEN COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT S. U. D. TREATMENT MODEL USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. IS NOT BASED ON A MEDICAL CHRONIC CARE MODEL. INSTEAD THE TREATMENT DURATION IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS. AND CURRENT AVAILABLE TREATMENT CAPACITY IS LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS PER YEAR. WE WILL BE PROPOSING -- LATER THE THIS SPRING A MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAM. INVOLVING LONG TERM COMBINATION THERAPY WITH MEDICATION AND BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS. THAT ARE BEST DELIVERED IN AN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SETTING. USING INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THIS APPROACH WILL PROVIDE A GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE RELIABILITY. EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY IN THE DELIVERY OF CLINICAL TREATMENTS. AND THAT IN TURN WILL ALLOW BETTER COST CONTROL AND TO PROMOTE BETTER POSITIVE OUTCOMES INCLUDING A DECREASE IN A RELAPSE. FATAL AND NONFATAL OVERDOSES. AN ABNORMAL BEHAVIORS WITHIN THE PRISON SETTING. WE BELIEVE IT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION IN RECIDIVIST. IN OUR MODEL. OF TREATMENT WOULD CONTINUE AFTER RELEASE FROM CDC OUR CUSTODY. AND THAT WILL REQUIRE COORDINATION WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. AND THAT COORDINATION HAS ALREADY BEGUN. HELLO LAST NOVEMBER WE CONVENE DAY TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS SUMMIT. IN TEN DIS INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE OF LA -- FINANCE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY REPRESENTATIVES FROM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. A COUNTY PROBATION COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES -- THE INTENTION OF THE MEETING WAS THE TO MEET WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO OUR PLAN. TO ENSURE ACCESS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. ESPECIALLY DURING THE HIGH RISK TRANSITION FROM PRISON. TO THE FREE WORLD. ADDITIONALLY THE FINAL SO ALL THE WAY DOWN FIVE BEST PRACTICES OPPORTUNITIES AND LEVERAGE POINTS. TO IMPROVE CARE DURING TRANSITION IT'S I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. ON THE MANY ISSUES THAT I KNOW WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW TREATMENT PROGRAM -- I'VE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT PERSONALLY WAS SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I'D LIKE TO EXTEND AN INVITATION TO DO SO AT YOUR CONVENIENCE. THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PRESENTATIONS. OKAY. IT'S FROM FINANCE [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS. PUBLIC COMMENTS YES. GOOD AFTERNOON GOING BACK AS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ENDING THE DRUG WAR AND REPLACING IT. WITH POLICIES BASED ON HEALTH COMPASSION HUMAN RIGHTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE RECEIVERS PROPOSAL PARTICULARLY ASPECTS TO ENROLL PEOPLE IN METHADONE OR BUPRENORPHINE WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED AND TO TAKE CARE OF THEM DURING THE TRANSITION OUT. AND WHEN IT COMES TO FATAL DRUG OVERDOSE. THERE IS AN OVER REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST INCARCERATED IN JAILS OR PRISONS OR JUSTIN DRUG TREATMENT. AMONG THE DEAD THEY NEED A WARM HAND OFF TO DRUG TREATMENT WE'RE THINK THE PROPOSAL IS SOUND THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS [inaudible] OKAY. THIS ITEM WAS TO BE HELD OVER -- THE RECOMMENDATION OBVIOUSLY GOVERNOR SUPPOSE INCLUDE THREE POINT SIX NINE MILLION. FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASE TO THE MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION PROMISE AND THIRTEEN PRESENTS TO ENCOURAGING THAT YOU'RE TELLING US THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE OUR IT WILL BASICALLY BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER ALL OF THEM BUT TWO IS THAT CORRECT IS THAT WHAT YOUR NUMBERS ARE SAYING. THE BILL WE HAVE TWO LEFT THAT'S REALLY HARD -- IN TERMS OF DELEGATION BUT IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE MORE THAN TWO BUT WE MORE THAN TWO IN LESS THAN SIX OKAY. THE WEATHER NUMBER SEEMED SMALL AND I WAS GETTING A SMALL FOR MY PERSPECTIVE A LOT BETTER THAN THIRTY FIVE WHAT EXACTLY -- EXACTLY OKAY FINE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UNFORTUNATELY LEFT LOS OUR CORPSMAN MR. STONE UP THE ROOM. I KNOW CRAFT I WAS TO TELL ME. STILL THERE SO IT YEAH HE'S COMING BACK BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMITTEE TO VOTER. TRACKING DOWN PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WHERE THE THIRD ITEM? WHICH IS A DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY WILL BE A LONG. ONE SO I WANTED. TO WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT ITEM WHICH IS -- THIS IS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANAGER DEAL POST IS A HUNTER SAID WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WERE WE GOING TO DISCUSS THE CONTRACT MEDICAL AUGMENTATION -- AS WELL OR YES WE CAN OKAY. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD THEN -- I AM DOING READER I AM THE DIRECTOR OVER FISCAL SERVICES FOR SHE SHE SHE S. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU JUST WHAT WOULD LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS. THE THE LA -- PRESENTED. YES. YES DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR QUESTION TO ONE OF THE AUDIENCE. THANK YOU. LUCAS MORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL FUNDING NECESSARY IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN NAMELY IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE VACANCIES ARE IN THREE D. C. R. I. AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR HOME VISITORS ESPECIALLY AROUND THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS -- AND THE PROPOSAL THEY SAY THAT THAT I'VE STOPPED THIRTY POINT THREE POSITIONS OVER THE AUTHORIZED AMOUNT. OF ON THE SAME PROPOSAL AS A FOOTNOTE SAYING THAT THE 10% COMMISSION BUT THEY CAN SEE. AND A SEPARATE PROPOSAL IN JANUARY THEY MENTION AND 18% VACANCY RATE FOR THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. SO IT'S UNCLEAR IF THAT'S POTENTIAL SALARY SAVINGS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TOWARDS THIS IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET YOUR IN ADDITION IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY DOES NOT INCREASE AND THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED -- LARGE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE COSTS OF RELATED TO INPATIENT -- KELLER. AND THAT WOULD BE ATTENTION TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR MEDICAID COVERAGE OKAY THANK. I'M INTERNET YES THE ON STAFF. AND MEDICARE -- THIS IS A VERY MUCH DOWN IN THE WEEDS HOW DO YOU COUNT VARIOUS NUMBERS -- WE GOT INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LITTLE LATE IN THE PROCESS I AND I THINK -- LET'S FROM ANALYST'S OFFICE DID NOT HAVE SOME OF OUR MOST RECENT INFORMATION THAT MORE CLEARLY EXPLAINS THE ISSUES THAT LA -- HAS IDENTIFIED -- I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOW SUPPLY THAT INFORMATION TO FINANCE AND THEY HAVE SUPPLY AND NEW INFORMATION THE LA -- HAVE THAT YET. OKAY THEY HAVE I WOULD SUGGEST DUBBED BEFORE WE TAKE THE COMMITTEE'S TIME UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THESE NUMBERS -- THE PERHAPS WE LET STAFF. I HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN RESOLVE THE APPARENT DISCREPANCIES I'M NOT DENYING THERE WERE DISCREPANCIES THAT. YOU WOULD RALLY -- WAS IDENTIFIED I JUST THINK THAT -- IT IT REALLY IS A STAFF DISCUSSION THAT WE CAN RESULT YOU JUST GOT RESCUED BUT THAT'S OKAY. OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO WE DISCUSSION. JUST A QUICK QUESTION YOU DID GET THE OF NEW INFORMATION WE WE RECEIVED INFORMATION ON THAT HALF IN LEVEL THERE IS A COMPONENT OF THE FUNDING THAT DIDN'T MATCH UP WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE BUDGET -- WE DID RECEIVE INFORMATION ON WHAT THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR AND THAT HAS BEEN CLARIFIED BUT I STILL QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THAT VACANCY RATES FOR THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND WHY FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS AREN'T BEING INCREASED. OKAY SO YOU UNDERSTAND OKAY YES WITH THE VACANCY RATES -- BUT WE DID THE PROPOSAL FOR THE BCP FOR THE APP WOULDN'T INCLUDE THE TELEMEDICINE PCP POSITIONS AND THAT INCREASED INFLATED OUR VACANCY RATE -- BECAUSE WE HADN'T INCLUDED THOSE -- WHEN WE DID THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WE DIDN'T INCLUDE THE THE TELEMEDICINE WHICH BROADER VACANCY RATE DOWN WHICH IS CURRENTLY AT FOUR POINT 6% -- SO VERY MINIMAL -- IN VERY MINIMAL SAVINGS THERE -- AS FAR AS THE REIMBURSEMENT -- WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT WAYS TO GET MORE REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDS -- UNFORTUNATELY IT'S OF IT'S A LENGTHY PROCESS TO GET THAT REIMBURSEMENT IT TAKES SOMETIMES UP TO TWO YEARS. AND SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE INCREASES IN OUR REIMBURSEMENT TO TO DRIVE US TO GO AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT -- AS WE GET CAUGHT UP IN WE SEE THOSE INCREASES WILL COME BACK AND AN INCREASE THAT IF POSSIBLE -- BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE OPTICS. NOT EVERY IN MAY QUALIFIES FOR MEDI CAL -- WHICH IS ONE ISSUE WE ONLY GET REIMBURSED FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND THEY'RE SLOWLY -- REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT RATE THEY STARTED A 100% AND I BELIEVE IT'S DOWN CLOSER TO ABOUT 93%. AND NEXT YEAR WILL BE GOING 290% SO THOSE FACTORS HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO TO COME FORWARD AND MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE REIMBURSEMENT AT THIS TIME OKAY. OKAY. I WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR THE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE WILL COMMITTEES. RIGHT FINE ARE WE GOING TO CALL ROLE AT THIS TIME.

HI MY NAME IS CHUCK SUPPLE AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE DR ROBERT COMMITMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I'M ALSO JOINED BY DR MARK MARK GALLI WHO IS THE CIRCUIT SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS TRYING TO SIR TODAY. THE DEAD PEOPLE. AND I WANTED TO PROVIDE AND WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME TO PRESENT BUT I WANTED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE THE VISION IN THE MISSION IN THE STRATEGY WHICH MOVING -- DJJ INTO A NEW DEPARTMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- AGENCY -- INTO A DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION ONE SECOND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND AND WAIT WILL CALL FOR YOU GUYS TO MAKE THEY WERE STANDING AND I WANT TO HAVE TO STAND THAT LONG WE WILL CALL FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENTS NO PROBLEM. UHHUH OKAY CONTINUE. BUT BY MOVING DJJ INTO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. IT'S A CRITICAL INTO IT A NEW DEPARTMENT. COMMITTEE THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION IS A CRITICAL STEP. ON THE JOURNEY OF STRENGTHENING DJJ IS ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL OUR VISION. AND MISSION UTILIZING SOME SOME KEY STRATEGIES AND THE JOURNEY THAT DJJ HAS BEEN ON CRITICALLY POST FERAL. AND THE WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO MOVING FORWARD I I SEE IN SORT OF THREE THREE DIRECTIONS THAT WE NEED -- TO ADVANCE ONE IS WE NEED TO SUSTAIN AND ADVANCE THE GAINS. THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT. AND FERAL WAS WAS HALF THE JOURNEY AND THERE IS STILL A JOURNEY TO CONTINUE AND A DIFF ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE. TWO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE A CULTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE MISSION AND IT'S A CULTURE OF SUCCESS. AND THREE WEEKS NEED TO WHAT I CALL BUILD UP THE STRENGTH BASS BASS. AND I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE. IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. VISION AND MISSION A STRATEGY LANGUAGE THAT I THINK CAN BEST BE ADVANCE THROUGH THIS MOVE. INTO AN OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AN OVERALL VISION. WHY IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE? KNOW WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE FOR YOUTH HER ONCE UNDER THE CARE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. IS THAT THEY HAVE TRANSITIONED SUCCESSFULLY INTO ADULTHOOD. AND THAT THEY HAVE THE SYSTEM FROM CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. AND THAT THEY ARE THRIVING AND ENGAGED MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE ACTIVE ELEMENTS IN THE RESTORATION OF THE COMMUNITY ALONG WITH. THEIR OWN RESTORATION. AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION BEING ABLE TO FULFILL THIS VISION. A ROLL A SIMPLE. THAT WE HELP YOU. WHO HAVE HURT PEOPLE? AND HAVE BEEN HURT THEMSELVES. RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY. AND BECOME RESPONSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL. ADULTS. IN A FIVE STRATEGIES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE TRAIL THE LANGUAGE THAT ARE THE STRATEGIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. WILL SEEK TO ADVANCE. ONE IS BUILDING SAFE AND CARING COMMUNITIES WITHIN [inaudible] THE DEPARTMENT. COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE GAVE ENGAGE ALL OF OUR MEMBERS. AND THAT INCLUDES STAFF YOUTH FAMILIES. VOLUNTEERS. IN FULFILLING THE MISSION. AND THIS IS KIND OF BORROWED FROM NORWAY IS BORROWED FROM GERMAN GERMANY THE NORMALCY PRINCIPLE THAT FOR THE BEST WAY TO HELP SOMEONE WHO IS NOT SAFE TO BE IN THE COMMUNITY LEARN HOW TO LIVE SAFELY WITHIN A COMMITTEE AS YOU BUILD NORMAL SOCIETY WTHIN. YOUR FACILITY FOR DJJ. THAT IS -- SKINNY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY YOU THINK COMMITTEE RESTORATION THAT'S BUILDINGS SAFE CARING COMMUNITY WITHIN OUR FACILITIES THE BEST ENVIRONMENT FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO LEARN HOW TO BE BLE. TO THRIVE WITHIN A COMMUNITY AND IT IS NOT JUST THE STAFF RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOR FILLING THAT MISSION. OF THE YOUTH THEIR FAMILIES OF VOLUNTEERS AND VISITORS AS WELL AND HAVE A NEW A NEW EDICT THAT ANYBODY WHO COMES TO VISIT THE GOT CONSERVE HIT THE DEPARTMENT -- AT HOUSE TO TO CONTRIBUTE HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF THE REHABILITATION AND SHARE SOMETHING OF THEIR EXPERIENCE SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO HELP US. HELP THOSE YOUTH RETURN SAFELY TO COMMUNITY BECOME RESPONSIBLE SUCCESSFUL ADULTS THE SECOND STRATEGY IS DEVELOP A FULLY PREPARED AND CONTINUALLY SUPPORTED. STAFF THAT IS HEALTHY EDUCATED AND TRAINED TO FULFILL THEIR UNIQUE AND VITAL ROLES TO FULFILL THIS MISSION. AND PART OF THE TRANSITION INTO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IT SPEAKS TO SETTING UP A TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE THAT. WORKS NOT JUST WITH THE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING IN AT THE VERY BEGINNING BUT ALL OF OUR STAFF ALL OF THEM ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THEIR UNIQUE ROLES IN FOR FILLING THAT MISSION. AND THAT INCLUDES TRAINING SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AS WELL AS FOR VOLUNTEERS AS WELL AS FOR THE YOUTH THEMSELVES TO PLAY A ROLE IS PEER MENTORS AND THE LIKE IN HELPING US TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL THE MISSION. THE THIRD IS. TO OFFER TREATMENT TO HELP YOU HEAL FROM THEIR PAST EXPERIENCES AND CHANGE THE THINKING BELIEVES THAT LEAD TO HURTING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS AND THAT'S VERY MUCH BUILDING UPON. THE MYRIAD OF EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM THAT CAME IN WITH THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT AND TO BE ABLE TO PARTICULARLY WITH -- THE THE MOVE TO A HHS TO BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ALL THE MORE ON TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AS WELL LAWS AS THE YOUTH WHO'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND THE NEXT WAS GREAT OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND AND RESTORE THE HARMS CAUSED BY THEIR ACTIONS RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE HARMS THAT THEIR ACTION THAT BROUGHT THEM TO D. J. J. AS WELL AS THE THE BEHAVIOR THAT CONTINUES WITHIN DJJ. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THOSE HARMS AND TO SET UP RESTORED ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO REPAIR THOSE HARM TO THE CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY. THAT TYPE OF RESTORATIVE ROLE WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. THE NEXUS PROVIDE EDUCATION TRAINING AND LIFE EXPERIENCES FOR YOU TO IMAGINE A SPIRE AND BUILD A PATHWAY TO A SUCCESSFUL LIFE AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT I CALL THE STRENGTH BASED SPACE WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO BE ABLE. TO IMAGINE AND BEGIN LIVING A LIFE WITHIN DJJ THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WHEN THEY GET OUT. AND THAT'S A HUGE SECOND PART WE CAN WE CAN DO ALL WE CAN TO TRY TO REDUCE REST IN THE WORD. HELP YOUTH LEARN HOW NOT TO FIGHT BUT MUCH IN TERMS OF EFFECTIVE LEARNING THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BRING INTO DJ JACK. IS THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE A REASON NOT TO FIGHT A LIFE THAT THEY CAN LIVE WHEN THEY GET OUT A NEW IDENTITY THAT THEY CAN PURSUE. CREDIBLE MESSENGER MENTORING IS A BIG PART OF THOSE WHO BETTER THAN TO BRING INTO OUR FACILITIES INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT WE ARE ASKING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO. AND HAVE IT BE BELIEVED AND SUPPORTED IN WAYS IN WHICH THEY CAN HELP GUIDE THEM TO THIS NEW IDENTITY AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES LIKE OUR CODING PROGRAM AND OTHERS TO BEGIN. LIVING THIS LIFE THAT THEY WANT TO WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO LIVE UPON THEIR RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY FINALLY. WE WANT TO BRING PEOPLE WITH RESOURCES RELATIONSHIPS EXPERTISE AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE INTO. THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION TO INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE YOU AND TO BUILD A CARING COMMUNITY THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT. FOR THEIR RE ENTRY AND ULTIMATELY THEY'RE HONORABLE DISCHARGE WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH PROBATION WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH. COMMUNITY PROGRAMS BRINGING THEM IN FAR EARLIER WE'VE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME OF THIS SO THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE MEETING THE INDIVIDUALS. IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SUPPORT THERE BEING CONNECTED WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATING IN PROGRAMMING IN DC CC. SO THAT CARING COMMUNITY TRICK TRANSCENDS DIRECTLY INTO THE COMMUNITY WE'RE GONNA DO OUR PART TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM. DJJ THE COMMUNITY OF YOU FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION AND A STRONG COMMUNITY. WITHIN OUR FACILITIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BUILD STRONG COMMUNITIES BACK IN WHERE THE YOUTH ARE GOING TO BE RETURNING FOR THAT TRANSITION TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER AT THIS POINT TO DR GALLEY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF HOW WE'D BE ABLE TO BETTER ACHIEVE THISWITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THANK YOU CHUCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE -- I MARK KELLY I'M THE SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- AND AS I THINK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US I THINK IT'S IT'S TO INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES. ONE TO SUPPORT THE YOUTH IN IN THE IN OUR CUSTODY WITH THE BASS PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN IMAGINE ONES WE WOULD WANT. FOR OURSELVES AND OUR OWN CHILDREN IN OUR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS AND BE ABLE TO BRING THOSE THOSE TO BEAR IN A VERY MEANINGFUL WAY. AT A THE PRIVILEGE TO VISIT WITH CHALK A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THE MENTOR FACILITY SAW THE COATING PROGRAM WHICH IS FANTASTIC AND AND BELIEVE SO MUCH MORE. LIKE THAT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR OUR NEW DEPARTMENT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AS YOU KNOW THE TWELVE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MANY OF THEM. PROVIDE THE SUBSTRATE IN THE SERVICES FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. THAT -- WHAT A TREMENDOUS CHANCE TO BRING SOME OF THAT EFFORT AND ENERGY -- TOGETHER WITH THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT -- SECRETARY D. AS HAS ALREADY BUILT -- ADD A JUVENILE JUSTICE AND TO SCALE THINGS AND A VERY MEANINGFUL WAY. TO ALLOW US TO BRING -- EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW FROM OUR HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORLDS TO THOSE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE OUR DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COME IN. AND TO REALLY BUILD COMMUNITY EARLY WITH WITH ARE YOU. TO ENSURE THAT THE HEALTH CARE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND THAT YOU TO HAVE HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE TRANSITION SAFELY TO COMMUNITY PROVIDERS WHO CAN CONTINUE THAT CARE. AND PROVIDE THE SUPPORT TO THE FAMILIES -- WHETHER IT'S IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH. ARENAS ADDITIONALLY I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY REINVENT HOW WE DO TRANSITIONS -- OUR YOUTH TO RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY GO BACK AND THE MORE WE ALLOW THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTIES IN OTHER CITIES. TO TO REALLY BE CALM RECEIVING CENTERS FOR THOSE YOUTH WITH A WITH A REALLY STRONG PLAN FOR ACTION THAT FOCUSES ON THAT COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION AND RESTORATION -- THERE'S A REAL CHANCE TO DO THIS IN AN INCREDIBLE WAY TO NOT ONLY CATCH UP WITH OTHER PLACES ARE ARE ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT TO REALLY BECOME A LEADER IN THIS AREA -- I WAS I WAS IMPRESSED BY -- THE YOUTH SAID I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET AND TALK WITH AND THE INTEREST THAT MANY HAD IN -- FIGURING OUT WHICH OPPORTUNITIES WERE AVAILABLE AND I THINK WE HAVE THE THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WE HAVE A GREAT CHANCE TO PARTNER WITH CHALK IN THE TEAM TO REALLY -- BRING THIS OVER IN A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND SEAMLESS WAY AND SUPPORT THE STAFF TO BUILD ON SUCCESS IS THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE. I LOOK FORWARD TO TO MAKING THAT HAPPEN AND SUPPORTING -- THIS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN A BOLD AN INCREDIBLE. THANK YOU OF GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M MORE IN WASHBURN WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE CJ CJ HAS WORKED WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BOUND FOR THE STATE YOUTH CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. AND WE'VE CLOSELY MONITORED CONDITIONS IN THE FACILITIES IN FEBRUARY WE RELEASED A REPORT WHICH I BELIEVE YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. DETAILING HOW EVERYDAY LIFE HAS CHANGED FOR YOU SINCE THE STATE WAS RELEASED. FROM A YEARS LONG CONDITIONS LAWSUIT CALLED THE FERAL LAWSUIT. FERRELL BEGAN IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS IN RESPONSE TO HORRIFIC ABUSES IN THE INSTITUTIONS AND IT LASTED FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. HOWEVER SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE DJJ FACILITIES HAVE SEEN AN ABRUPT END. TO THE REPORTING INSPECTIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIRED UNDER FERAL NOW NO SINGLE OVERSIGHT BODY EXISTS TO ENSURE THE DJJ IS FULFILLING ITS BASIC OBLIGATION. TO KEEP YOU SAFE. AND TO PREPARE THEM TO RETURN HOME. OUR RESEARCH EVALUATED ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE AT DJJ. FROM INTAKE TO RE ENTRY. AND A FEW KEY THEMES EMERGED. ONE BUT THE DJJ INSTITUTIONS REMAIN DOMINATED BY A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE AND FEAR. TWO THAT YOUTH ARE ROUTINELY ISOLATED. BOTH FROM HEALTHY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND FROM THEIR FAMILIES BACK ON AND THREE THE DJJ IS INHERENTLY NON REHABILITATIVE. FOR YOUTH IN DJJ VIOLENCE IS A PART OF THEIR DAILY LIVES. ON AVERAGE THIRTY THREE YOUTH PER HUNDRED IN THE FACILITIES ARE INVOLVED IN FIGHTS BEATINGS OR RIGHTS EACH MONTH. AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A DRAMATIC SPIKE IN USE OF FORCE BY STAFF. WITH THE RATE THAT'S INCREASED NEARLY THREE FOLD SINCE THE END OF FERAL [inaudible] DJJ. FRANKLY IS DOMINATED BY CULTURE OF FEAR THE PLACE IS YOUTH ON HIGH ALERT AND EXACTS. A SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL. AND STAFF OFTEN RESPOND TO THIS VIOLENCE BY ISOLATING YOUTH. AND DEPRIVING THEM OF HEALTHY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. IN THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT PROGRAM BTP. WHICH PLACES YOUTH IN RELATIVE ISOLATION FOR WEEKS MONTHS AND SOMETIMES EVEN YEARS ON AND PROFOUNDLY AFFECTING THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING. AND BECAUSE DJJ IS REMOTELY LOCATED. MANY YOUTH ARE ALSO ISOLATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES BACK CALL. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF YOU THE DJJ ARE PLACED MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILES FROM THEIR HOME COUNTIES WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM. TO MAINTAIN A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH LOVED ONES DURING THIS CRITICAL PERIOD IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. SO BOTH THE ISOLATION AND VIOLENCE YOUTH EXPERIENCE AT DJJ DIRECTLY UNDERMINES ITS REHABILITATIVE AIMS. AND THE RESULT IS POOR OUTCOMES. SO THREE QUARTERS OF YOUTH ARE RE ARRESTED MORE THAN HALF A RE CONVICTED AND MORE THAN A THIRD RETURN TO STATE CUSTODY WITHIN THREE YEARS OF RELEASE FROM DJJ. AND OUR SURVEY FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY 60% OF YOUTH ARE NEITHER EMPLOYED NOR ENGAGE IN AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. YOUTH LEAVE DJJ WITH DEEP TRAUMA AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION. UPON RETURNING HOME MANY USE TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF JUST SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT. AND HOW IT FELT TO TRY TO SHED THE HYPER VIGILANCE THAT THEY NEEDED JUST TO SURVIVE IN THE FACILITIES. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR DECADES OF RESEARCH HAVE FOUND THAT THESE CONDITIONS ARE ENDEMIC TO LARGE CONGER GET REMOTE INSTITUTIONS LIKE DJJ. AND NO AMOUNT OF SUPERFICIAL REFORM OR FACILITY UPGRADES WILL BRING THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONS. CLOSER TO USE HOMES AND FAMILIES OR ENSURE YOU SAFETY. SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THESE ISSUES AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING YOU THREATEN CENTER IN TODAY'S DISCUSSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ELIZABETH CALVIN -- SENIOR ADVOCATE IN THE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS DIVISION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. A NON GOVERNMENTAL. INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION WORKING IN SOME NINETY COUNTRIES. I AM COMMITTED TO ENDING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT. ONCE AND FOR ALL. AS I THINK YOU PROBABLY KNOW THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF OUR GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR NEWSON WHO JUST DAYS AFTER HIS INAUGURATION CHOSE TO VISIT A YOUTH PRISON AS ONE OF HIS FIRST OFFICIAL ACTS. STANDING WITH YOUTH HE ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION TO REMOVE THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FROM THE STATE'S ADULT. CORRECTION AGENCY AND SET IN MOTION CHANGES TO HOW CALIFORNIA TREATS ITS YOUTH. WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. THIS IS A BOLD ACT. IT'S A BIG MOVE. WE UNDERSTAND TO THAT IT IS ALSO A DIFFICULT TASK. EXTRICATING A DIVISION FROM A LARGE AGENCY AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF STAFF. YOUTH AND COMMUNITIES WILL REQUIRE NO DOUBT GRAPPLING WITH ON GLAMOROUS AND THORNY DETAILS. WE SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO ACCOMPLISHING THIS MOVE. IN A SYSTEMATIC AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER. IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT THE GOVERNOR CHOSE TO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS AND THE POTENTIAL. OF OUR YOUTH WHO ARE IN THE DEEP END OF THE SYSTEM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IS ABOUT YOUTH WHO MANY WOULD JUST AS SOON. GIVE UP ON THE TO THE RECOGNITION OF THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT AN UP LIFT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START. IF IT STOPS THERE THOUGH WE WILL ALL LOOK BACK ON THIS MOMENT. AND WE'LL REALIZE THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WAS SQUANDERED. THE PROPOSAL ONLY ADDRESSES THE STATE SYSTEM WHICH REPRESENTS LESS THAN 1%. ACTUALLY POINT 3% OF YOUTH WHO ARE REFERRED TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR SEVENTY THOUSAND YOUTH WERE REFERRED TO PROBATION AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. CALIFORNIA HAS A DEEP BENCH OF KNOWLEDGEABLE YOUTH JUSTICE JUSTICE ADVOCATE TO HAVE WORKED ON THESE ISSUES LITERALLY FOR DECADES. OUR NORTH STAR IS A SYSTEM THAT OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALING AND TRANSFORMATION FOR SURVIVORS OF CRIME YOUTH ACCUSED OF CRIMES ARE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S VISION IS TO END JOURNAL JUSTICE AS WE KNOW IT. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS REPRESENT WHAT SHOULD BE IN ITS PLACE. YOU HAVE OUR MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH MEMO. REFLECTING TWO YEARS OF WORK ON A PLAN FOR REFORM IN CALIFORNIA. IN IT WE OFFER SEVERAL CONCRETE SMALL STEPS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THIS BUDGET. TO ACHIEVE MORE HOLISTIC CHANGE. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT OF CONTROL AT THE STATE LEVEL. YET PROBLEMS HAVE PERSISTED EACH TIME. WHICH HE EACH OF THOSE STRIPS THOSE MOST AFFECTED BY THE LINGERING PROBLEMS ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS FOR THE MOVE ONE THAT INVOLVES A DIVIDE A DIVERSE BODY OF STAKEHOLDERS. AND EXPERTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH DIRECT EXPERIENCE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND TAKES THE TIME TO THINK THROUGH HOW TO SET IN MOTION BROADER CHANGES FOR THE STATE'S YOUNG PEOPLE -- MEMO LAYS OUT FIVE BIG IDEAS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSFORMATION AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE MOVE OF DJJ I'M GOING TO QUICKLY REVIEW TO MR VIDEO. NEXT TO ME WILL DESCRIBE -- THREE FIRST WE ASK. THAT WHILE PLANNING FOR THE DJJ MOVE THE STATE SHOULD EXPLORE ESTABLISHING A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK ACROSS ALL YOUTH SERVING SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. A CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY SHOULD BE CREATED EITHER AS A STANDALONE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AGENCY OR UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF AN EXISTING AGENCY WITH DEDICATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCES TO ENSURE COORDINATION. EFFICACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS ALL YOUTH SERVING SYSTEMS NOT DRESSED THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE RECOMMEND BUDGET ALLOCATIONS TO CREATE A COMMISSIONER TASK FORCE THAT WOULD GIVE INPUT ON THE TRANSITION OF DJJ OUT OF CDC OUR MAP ALL STATES. A YOUTH SERVING SYSTEMS FUNDING STREAMS AND SERVICES. EXAMINE EXISTING OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS AND DETERMINE HOW THEY CAN BE RECONFIGURED IN ORDER TO BE GROUNDED IN YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES. AND TO GIVE INPUT ON BEST PRACTICES FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND STAFF TRAINING RULES OF THIS AGENCY. WE ASK THAT THIS COMMAND THIS COMMISSIONER TASK FORCE GET THE TIME NEEDED TO PROCEED WITH THE MOVE AND EXPLORE NEXT STEPS AT THE SAME TIME. WE RECOMMEND THAT SUCH A BODY SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE GOVERNOR BY MARCH -- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND THE NEW AGENCY BE LAUNCHED NO EARLIER THAN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE YOU CAN REFER TO PAGES ELEVEN AND TWELVE FOR MORE DETAILS ON THIS. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO REMOVE ALL THE SEC AUTHORITY OVER CHILDREN AND YOUTH. CALIFORNIA HAS NO CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY WITH ENFORCEMENT POWER OVER ITS YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THROUGH REALIGNMENT AND OTHER FORCES THE STATE'S ROLL OVER YOUTH HAS DIMINISHED WELL A BIGGER RATIO OF CASES HAVE BEEN HANDLED AT THE COURT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SINCE THE END OF THE FERAL LITIGATION THERE'S BEEN NO MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OVER DJJ. AND WHILE THE B. S. C. C. MAINTAINS OVERSIGHT OVER COUNTY FACILITIES IT IS A WEEK. AND THERE IS IN FACT AN ATTORNEY GENERAL OPINION CONCLUDING. THAT THE FCC REGULATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE. THE STATE DOES NOT PROVIDE LEADERSHIP FOR ONGOING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT. POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR YOUTH UNDER COUNTY SUPERVISION. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE SAME COMMISSION DEVELOP A PLAN TO TRANSFER THE BSE SEAT AUTHORITY OVER YOUTH. AND CHILDREN TO A NEW AGENCY EFFECTIVE JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE YOU CAN REFER TO PAGES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN ARE MEMO FOR DETAILS REGARDING THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR. OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS HEARING. I BELIEVE THAT WE COULD BE OUT. AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL TURNING POINT. A GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN I STARTED THIS MY NAME IS ISRAEL VIA ON THE PROGRAMMING PARTY CORNER WITH ME BY OUT IN SALINAS. A WE ARE PROUD MEMBERS ALLIANCE OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR WE ARE PROUD MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LINE FOR YOU THANK COMMUNITY JUSTICE. WE BOUGHT IS CULTIVATING CHAIN MAKERS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES WE PROVIDE INNOVATIVE CULTURALLY RELEVANT APPROACH THAT SUPPORT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. AND WORK TO EN MASS INCARCERATION. WE USE HEALING TO FORM RELATIONSHIPS SENATE APPROACHES TO INCUBATE NEXT GENERATION LEADERSHIP AND INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE STRIVING FOR RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. A SMALL GROUP OF YOUTH JUSTICE ADVOCATE JOINED TOGETHER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO DEVELOP A RESEARCH BASED. MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO TEN YEARS OF CHANGE TO CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO ITS YOUTH. THE END RESULT WAS TEN IDEAS FOR TEN YEARS THAT CHANGED THE RESULT WHAT A SEVENTY THE RESULT WAS A SEVENTY PAGE DOCUMENT. THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED BUT OUR MEMEL TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE IDEAS WE FOUGHT MOST RELEVANT TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED MOVE. WE ARE FORMING CARS RATED WHERE FAMILY OF YOUTH IN THE SYSTEM WE ARE RESEARCHERS WHERE ADVOCATES ACTIVISTS ATTORNEY THAT PROFESSORS. OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IS DIVERSE AND WE'LL THE COMMON GOAL OF HEALING AND EMPOWERMENT FOR OUR YOUTH AND COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SIGNED ON IN SUPPORT OF THE IDEAS IN THE MEMO WE PROVIDED. YOU IN LATE MARCH AND I BELIEVE YOU GUYS HAVE AN UPDATED LIST. MRS CALVIN REVIEWED TWO OF THE FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS I WHEN I DESCRIBED THREE ADDITIONAL ONES FIRST IN THE CONTEXT OF PLANNING FOR THE DJJ MOVE THE STATE SHOULD EXPLORE ENDING THE USE OF LARGE. PRISON LIKE FACILITIES FOR CASES AB JUDICATA IN JUVENILE COURT. YOUTH CURRENTLY HOUSED AT THE DAY AFTER JUVENILE COURT ADJUDICATION SHOULD BE MOVED TO SMALL STATE RUN. REGIONAL REGIONALLY BASED FACILITIES ARE CLOSER TO HOME. OUR AT OUR MEMEL OUTLINED SOME OF THE PARAMETERS NO NEW BUILDINGS. USING EXISTING UNDER UTILIZED OR CLOSE COUNTY BUILDINGS AND LEAVING INCARCERATION AS A LAST RESORT. BY FURTHER LIMITING YOUTH ELIGIBLE FOR CORPORATION. FOR THE BUDGET WE RECOMMEND THE COMMISSION SLASH TASK FORCE TO EXPLORE HOW THIS WOULD WORK AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE LOCATION AND NUMBER OF REGIONALLY BASED FACILITIES BY MARCH. TWENTY TWENTY SECOND THE STATE SHOULD INVEST FURTHER IN COMMUNITY BASED INTERVENTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. CALIFORNIA TO STOP RELYING ON THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THE STAFF INVEST IN YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. IF THEY CAN DO THIS BY RE DIRECTING EXISTING FUNDING STREAMS AND CREATING NEW ONCE DESCRIBED ON PAGE. SIX THE BUDGET STEPS WOULD INCLUDE SENDING BENCHMARKS FOR RESEARCHING COMMUNITY ALTERNATIVES. POWER TIGHTENING COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION. FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE START THE PROCESS OF RE DRAFTING ITS YOUTH JUSTICE COLD. IT HAS BEEN NEARLY SIXTY YEARS SINCE CALIFORNIA LAST OVER ALL THE COLD. TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT THE LAWS THAT GOVERN WHAT HAPPENED TERM WAS ONE WHAT CHILDREN WERE FIRST WRITTEN AROUND THE SAME TIME. THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE BUILDING WAS ERECTED IF THEY HAD THE TERM AT THE BILL IN THIS OLD AND OUTDATED IT NO LONGER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NEEDS TO BE LEVELED. AND BUILT A NEW. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR YOUTH JUSTICE LAWS THE LAWS ARE WRITTEN WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF DECADES OF RESEARCH ON EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO YOUTHFUL MISS BEHAVIOR. AND ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND PRINCIPLES OF POSITIVE YOUTH JUSTICE. MOREOVER THE LAWS WERE WRITTEN WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMATIC BIAS. THAT HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON YOUTH OF COLOR. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. AS A FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION A NEW PURPOSE CLAUSE BE ENACTED FOR THE WEEK COLD. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PURPOSE CLASS PROPOSED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET TRAILER BILL IS FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. I WHILE WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT WILL APPLY. ONLY TO STATE FACILITIES AS A LITTLE BIT AS ELIZABETH DESCRIBED THIS IS LESS THAN 1% OF YOUTH WHO TOUCH OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE PROPOSES START WITH THE NEW PURPOSE STATEMENT FOR THE WHOLE STATE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A PROPOSED PURPOSE BECAUSE THIS IS GREATER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. THAT HARMS OF JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT FALL MOST HEAVILY ON YOUTH OF COLOR AND REFORMS. MUST. PRIORITIZE ANY RACIAL DISPARITIES. BUT THEIR SELF SO MUCH MORE TO DO MY EXPERIENCE AS A MEMBER OF THE TARA FIFTEEN WORK GROUP. THAT WORKED ON TARA FIFTY REVISIONS MADE CLEAR THAT UNTIL THE STATE MAKES CONCRETE CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM OF OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. OUR EFFORTS WILL BE USELESS MANY THOUGHTFUL POWERFUL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE TARA FIFTEEN REGULATIONS BUT THE STATE HAS NO WAY TO ENFORCE THEM. I KNOW VERY WELL HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS MY FIRST CONTACT WITH THE WITH THE LAW WAS IN SIXTH GRADE FOR AN ALTERCATION. I CONTINUE TO ESCALATE FROM THERE I AM NOW FORTY ONE AND SPENT OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE LOCKED UP IN JUVENILE HALL GROUP HOMES SEE WHY STATE AND FEDERAL PRISON. NOT ONCE WHAT IN THE SYSTEM WAS MY PROBLEM EVER QUESTION NO WAY THE ROOT CAUSES OF MY BEHAVIOR AS A CHILD EVER ADDRESSED INSTEAD THE SYSTEM BECAME PART OF MY HISTORY OF TRAUMA. I NEVER EVEN HEARD THE WORD TROM OR HAD ANY IDEA WHAT IT MEANT UNTIL I WAS OUT AND INVOLVED WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED CULTURALLY GROUNDED ORGANIZATION THAT'S RUNNING ME WITH LOVE AND GAVE ME THE TOOLS TO HEAL MYSELF. AND NOW ALLOW ME TO HELP OTHERS. DINNER AFTER THURSDAY'S EVERY PERSON WAS SACRED EVERY PERSON WAS EMBRACED EVERYONE HAD A ROLE TO PLAY. THAT'S THE MESSAGE RIGHT THERE. EVERY PERSON EVERY YOU HAS VALUE IS SACRED AND MUST BE EMBRACED. I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA CAN EMBRACE ALL ITS YOUTH. SOME OF IT HAS BEGAN DJJ HAS STARTED BRINGING A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO THE YOUTH PRESENCE AND ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO THE YOUTH WILL RELATE TO TO BE MENTORS AND GUIDES. ME BY REGULARLY MEETS WITH YOU THAT THE JJ AND I KNOW WE'RE HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT. WE SPOKE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO MOVIE JJ AWAY FROM CORRECTIONS AND TO STATE TO SET IN MOTION THE STEPS RECOMMENDED HERE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING. I STRONGLY BELIEVE BY WORKING TOGETHER WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS WE WILL END YOU THINK CAR SERRATION AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF OUR YOUTH I CONTINUE TO LEAD THE NATION WERE JUVENILE JUSTICE IS CONCERNED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE HAVE RELEASED THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- TO EFFECTUATE THIS PROPOSED TRANSFER -- LAST LAST WEEK -- WE KNOW THAT THIS -- ISSUES OF GREAT INTEREST TO MEMBERS -- WE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AS WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE RELEASE LANGUAGE WE BEFORE -- TO ROBUST SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE DETAILS AND WITH FORD ENGAGING WITH YOU ALL AND YOUR STAFF -- AS WELL AS EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS -- AND WE HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD. OKAY [inaudible] LL. LUCAS MORE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED A FEW KEY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS DOES DJ NEED TO BE REORGANIZED TO IMPROVEREHABILITATION -- WE NOTE THAT. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT SPECIFIC BARRIERS EXIST TO REHABILITATION WITHIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. AND IN ADDITION IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THE COURT SYSTEM IS PERFORMING THE MOST RECENT DATA ON RECIDIVISM. IS FUN THE COHORT WITH WHO IS RELEASED AND 200-011-2000 -- TWELVE THAT WAS WHILE THE FELLOW AUSSIE WAS STILL UNDER LITIGATION. IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THE COURT SYSTEM AS A PERFORMING NOW THAT ADDITIONAL CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE -- AND IN ADDITION WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED SUB WILL BENEFIT STONE THIS CONVERSATION -- IT'S NOT GO WHAT POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES THIS REORGANIZATION COULD HAVE -- FOR INSTANCE IT COULD COMPLICATE THE COORDINATION OF SO RECESS BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS -- AND THEN. WE ALSO -- OF WHAT ALL THE ALTERNATIVE ORGANIZATIONS ARE POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE REHABILITATION IF THAT IS DESIRED APPROACH TO TAKE -- FOR INSTANCE WE COULD POTENTIALLY REALIGNED THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE COUNTIES OTHER THAN HAVING A SEPARATE STATE AND COUNTY SYSTEM THIS IS. OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT OUR OFFICE HAS -- PUT FORWARD IN THE PAST -- ANOTHER APPROACH WOULD BE TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURAL BUT MAKE CHANGES WITHIN IT -- OR POTENTIALLY INCREASE THIRD PARTY OVERSIGHT. AND THEN FINALLY -- WE RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY SHOULD GO THROUGH TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION --NOTING THAT THE PREVIOUS REALIZATIONS OF THE STATE'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAVE GONE THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH REORGANIZATION PROCESS THAT ESTABLISHMENT STATUTE. AND IT'S NOT MADE CLEAR WHY THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL SHOULD GO THROUGH TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION INSTEAD [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FOR MEMBERSHIP THE SYSTEM [inaudible] THANK YOU. SECRETARY NICE TO MEET YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU AND AND IT'S WITH STUBBLE LICENSE YOU AGAIN I SEE THE BOTH OF YOU HERE. I THINK FOR THIS DISCUSSION. WE NEED TO RE FRAME. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN MISTER SUPPLE YOU TALKED ABOUT? KIDS WHO HURT PEOPLE AND TO THEMSELVES OF BEEN HURT LET'S REFRAME THAT KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN HURT. BECAUSE IF WE'RE IF THIS IS A STEP [inaudible] THAT. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE TAKING AND IS WHAT I SAW THIS PROPOSED I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. BUT IF ALL WE DO IS REMOVE DJJ INTO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND JUST MOVE THIS INCARCERATION PEAS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. I THINK WE'VE MISSED A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE. AND THAT IS TO RE. HOW WE ADDRESS KIDS AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO SAY KIDS AT RISK EVEN THOUGH MY GOOD FRIEND HERE WILL ALWAYS CHANGE? KIDS TOOK TOUGH TALK ABOUT KIDS ARE PROMISE. I KNOW THAT'S OF THIS CAN BE A HARD ONE FOR ME TO ALWAYS REMEMBER. BECAUSE THESE KIDS ARE KIDS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED AND SUFFERED THEIR THEIR ORIGINS THERE. CHALLENGES ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THOSE KIDS TO GET REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. ULTIMATELY SO IF WE RE THINK THE SYSTEM THAT'S FOR CHILDREN ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT HAVE CHALLENGES AND WHO WE NEED TO HELP ED WHO DESERVE OUR HELP. ESSENTIALLY NO WRONG DOOR FOR ANY CHILD NOW I THINK WE'RE WE HAVE SOMETHING. KIDS WHO BUT OF ALL THE JUSTICE SYSTEM MAY HAVE. AND SOME ISSUES THAT AND THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAT AT THAT OTHER KIDS DON'T NEED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THAT'S THERE SOMETIMES FINE LINES THERE THAT THAT. WE NEED TO ADDRESS. BUT ULTIMATELY ADDRESSING THE ISSUES FOR ALL KIDS. AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. ULTIMATELY MAKE THE NEED FOR A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. DOWN THE LIGHT. HOPEFULLY IDEAL -- THAT'S I THINK THE SYSTEM WE CAN STRIVE. FOR SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS AGENCY AS BEING ONE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO COMBINE A NUMBER OF THESE COMPONENTS WHERE WE SERVE KIDS. IN CALIFORNIA. WHETHER THEY'RE HOMELESS WHETHER THEY'RE JUSTICE INVOLVED WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WAR. POTENTIALLY IS TO BE REMOVED FROM HOMES A NUMBER OF COUNTIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENCE RESPONSE SYSTEMS WHERE THEY'RE GIVING SERVICES TO FAMILIES BEFORE THAT CHILD NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. THOSE CASES ARE ALSO DEALING WITH. ISSUES IN THOSE FAMILIES THAT MIGHT PREVENT A CHILD THEN FROM BEING JUSTICE INVOLVED. BECAUSE THOSE FAMILIES ARE GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. SO WE CAN BRING WELL HEALTH COMPONENTS INTO THIS WE CAN BRING. HEALTH COMPONENTS INTO THIS. CULTURAL ISSUES FAMILY ISSUES ADVERTISE THAT EXPERIENCES INTO A SYSTEM TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE THEN WE DON'T NEED. WHAT HAS DEVELOPED INTO THIS PUNITIVE SYSTEM AND I KNOW WE'RE STRUGGLING LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE PRISON SYSTEM WHICH IS BUILT ON PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN REHABILITATION? THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE SO AGAIN IF WE THINK. JUST IN THAT NARROW CONTEXT OF MOVING DJJ INTO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. I WE REALLY MISS SOMETHING IF WE RE THANK WHAT THE BROADER SYSTEM IS AND THIS IS WHERE. I KNOW THE LA -- DEPARTMENT FINANCE LOOKING AT PUTTING SOME MONEY AND I THINK THIS IS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT THIS TRAILER BILL THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PUT SOME MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM. TO TO REDESIGN HOW ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS WORK TOGETHER WE CAN ADDRESS AND COVER A LOT MORE GROUND. AND THAT IT SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY THE JUSTICE SIDE OF THINGS FOR KIDS WHO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE BUT DRIVEN BY THE THE NEED THAT OUR FAMILIES HAVE IN OUR CHILDREN HAVE. SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP JUST AS ABOUT THAT THEY DON'T END UP REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES THEY DON'T END UP WITH THESE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE SITUATIONS THAT THEY HAVE. AND THEN WE CAN DEAL WITH EACH KID AS THEIR NEED AS THEY AS THEY GO. THAT'S TO ME WAS WHAT WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S THE STEP I THINK WE CAN TAKE. IF WE DO THAT BUT IF WE IF WE ALL WE'RE GONNA DO IS LIMIT OURSELVES MOVING DJJ AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE MISS THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THINK THIS THROUGH A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CEDING. THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN A SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS CHANGE WITH THE SYSTEM TO CHANGE ISN'T JUST DJJ THE SYSTEM TO CHANGE SERVICES FOR KIDS. AND THEN THERE IS A COMPONENT OF IT WHERE WE MAY NEED TO DEAL WITH THE REHABILITATIVE AND WITH THAT THE THE MISTAKE IT THAT A KID HAS MADE. SOLVE THAT HELP SOLVE THAT PROBLEM FOR THEM AND FOR THAT COMMUNITY VENN WHETHER THEY'VE BAD REMOVED FROM A FAMILY WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN HOMELESS WHETHER THEY'VE BAD TRAFFIC. WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN JUSTICE INVOLVED. FIND WAYS TO GET THEM BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES IN A PRODUCTIVE HEALTHY WAY THAT THAT HELPS THEM BREAK THE CYCLES THAT HAVE LED THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE. SO LET'S. AIM HIGH LET'S REALLY LOOK AT ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO SUPPORT KIDS WHICH I KNOW UNFORTUNATE GOES A LITTLE BIT. ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE WAY WE HAVE BROKEN UP. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT'S GOING TO BE. INTERESTING BUT I THINK WE CAN DO THAT AND WITH WITH A WOMAN GOVERNOR AND WITH. OUTSIDE I KNOW THIS COVER WILL TAPE IT EIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF US. TO REALLY BE ABLE TO LOOK HARD AT THE SYSTEM. WE COULD DO SOMETHING EVEN MORE AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE CAN ULTIMATELY GET TO SO AS WE HAVE THE NEXT FEW CONVERSATIONS AROUND. THIS PROPOSAL THIS SPECIFIC BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE TO DO SOMETHING HERE BUT WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WITH YOUR DEPARTMENTS. AND THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY WITH ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CAN BRING. TO BEAR WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH HE'S BRINGING THAT INTO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM AND OTHER PIECES THAT. THAT NEED TO WORK BETTER TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE REALLY EXCITING AND GIVE US A MUCH BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO TO ADDRESS ISSUES FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S WORTHY OF ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER ON MAKING SURE WE GET. THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO TABLE GET THE RIGHT DECISIONS MADE AND KIND OF BREAK DOWN THE THE THE SILOS THE BARRIERS TO BEING ABLE TO WORK ACROSS DISCIPLINES WHICH WE'RE NOT OFFICE AT GOOD DOING BUT IF WE CAN DO THAT. THEN WE CAN SERVE KIDS MUCH BETTER AND I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL FOR ALL OF US A REALLY HAPPY TO SEE YOU HERE. AND HAVE THIS COVERAGE IS A REALLY START OFFICE CONVERSATION BUT WE COULD BE. WE COULD BE ON SOMETHING HERE THAT REALLY IMPROVES OUR COMMUNITIES IN A BIG WAY. MRS JONES SAWYER. NOT THE HOUSE WHEN IT THANK YOU -- BUT I WAS ALSO VERY EXCITED -- ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BECAUSE WE ACT WE CAN'T CONTINUES TO SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT. RESULTS [inaudible] BOB. BUT ALSO LIKE TO SEE A VISION. NOT JUST MOVED CHAIRS ON THE TITANIC. THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND THAT -- I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE GOVERNOR'S VISION ON HOW YOU WANT. THIS TO LOOK ULTIMATELY -- RIGHT NOW THEY'RE OUT THERE. THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS -- BUT BASICALLY TRAINING THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THESE ANY GLADIATOR CAMPS BECOME BETTER CRIMINALS WILL BECOME BETTER. PERSONS TO GO ON TO PRESENTS AND BECOME BETTER PRISONERS AND AND BE INCARCERATED FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. AND WE HAVE NOT DONE A VERY GOOD JOB. IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM RIGHT NOW -- PART OF THAT IS A CULTURAL THING. THAT WHAT YOU'RE ALL IN THAT SAME SILO BECAUSE YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT AND I'M VERY FAMILIAR GOVERNMENT WHAT YOU'RE IN THAT SILO. YOU IS REALLY HARD TO GET OUT OF IT IN NEW ALL BECOME KIND OF THE SAME [inaudible] AND ALMOST LIKE A SCHOOL SYSTEM YOU. YOU GO FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. AND YOU REALLY NEVER GET OUT OF OF WHERE WHAT YOU USED. TO AND SO -- I WANT IS I WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT? THE DIVISION IS FOR THIS AND IF THAT INCLUDES HAVING US HERE HELP YOU WITH THAT VISION. WE SHOULD OTHERWISE I I THINK BOTH FINANCE AND AND AND LA -- URBAN CONSTANTLY BE FRUSTRATED ABOUT COME OUT WITH A NUMBER. DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING YOU KNOW WE START ORGANIZATIONS WE ASK FOR MISSION STATEMENT AND ALL OF THAT BUT WE HAVE AN ASK FOR MISSION STATEMENT HERE WE HAVE ASKED FOR WHAT IS OUR ULTIMATE VISION WE HAVE NOBODY'S GIVEN US. ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WE JUST SAID. MOVE CHAIRS OVER HERE. AND HOPE FOR A BETTER RESULT -- I ALSO. HAVE BEEN USING. THE TERM AT PROMISE. BECAUSE AGAIN WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE KIDS DIFFERENTLY -- IF WE KEEP CALLING -- JUVENILES JUVENILE DELINQUENCY CALLING HIM AT RISK WE KEEP CALLING NAMES LIKE THAT. THEN THEY WILL ACT APPROPRIATELY. IF YOU TELL THEM THERE'S A FUTURE FOR THEM THAT'S A PROMISE TO THEM THEY WILL GET BETTER. AND WHEN I MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DJJ. TELL ME THAT. I NEED TO ME AS A AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO USE -- PEPPER SPRAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THOSE KIDS ARE REALLY REALLY BAD. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE GO THROUGH BUT THERE'S SOMETHING. WRONG WHEN THE STAFF ITSELF. IS KIND OF CRIMINALIZING CRIMINALIZING THE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND SO I I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU IF YOU CAN A BILL THAT SHE GOT A BILL THAT FROM HER. GROUND UP I BELIEVE YOU CAN BUILD IT WITH THE EXISTING STAFF BUT THOSE THAT DON'T SHARE THE VALUES THE VISION -- ABOUT WHO YOU MIGHT BE TIME FOR THEM RETIRE. IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR THEM TO TO TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NEW SYSTEM WE'RE BUILDING IS GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE STAFF IS THE ONE THAT WOULD FIT IN ONCE IT WILL IMPLEMENT THIS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM ON BOARD. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM FULLY BEHIND YOU ALL ORDERS ROWING AT THE SAME TIME. YOU WILL REPLACE THIS WITH THE SAME D. J. J. THAT YOU HAVE NOW ONLY IT'S IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. YOU JUST MOVED THE CHAIRS WHEN YOU DECIDED TO TENT. AND SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO SIT DOWN WITH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU WANT TO WORK IN THESE FACILITIES. NOW TO GET BY IN THE GET THEIR INPUT HOW. YOUR YOUR VISION IS. SO THAT YOU HAVE THE SOLDIERS WITH YOU -- TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND AND THEN FINALLY -- WHAT TWO THINGS? ONE WORKING WITH THE JUVENILE COURTS. HOPEFULLY WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE -- MAKE MAYBE COMING YOUR WAY ARE NOT COMING YOUR WAY DO WE DO IT IN THE TO DO IT AND COMMUNITY. DO YOU BRING THEM. INTO THIS SETTING OF THE JUVENILE COURTS ARE THE THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO GUIDE A LOT OF THIS AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE A US A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND LOOK AT THE DATA WE HAVE. AN ULTIMATE OVERSIGHT OF ALL OF THAT. AND FINALLY THIS WORD CALLED FROM. TRUMP IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AS I'VE GOT DUPES SEVERAL UP PRISONS -- MEETING WITH ADULT PRISONERS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE TOLD ME. SOME REALLY HORRIFIC THINGS THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCE OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. THAT -- I CALL PUSH BACKSTREET DISORDER BECAUSE WHAT GOES ON THE STREETS SOMETIME MUCH WORSE TOMATOES ON IN WAR. AND THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SPRING SOME THINGS THAT YOU AND I IF IT HAPPENED TO US. WE HAVE TO SEE SEEK MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS -- TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH IT AND SNEEZE AT LIKE FIVE YEAR OLD SECURE -- SEVEN YEAR OLD AND THEN WE EXPECT THEM. TO GROW OUT OF IT OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO -- IT MADE ME MORE MONEY DÃ¢N. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE. OF THE TABLE MAY BE LOOKING AT BECAUSE IT'S A WHOLE SYSTEM OF CARE. THAT WE MAY BE LOOKING AT AND NOT JUST -- WHERE CAN WE PUT THEM? UNTIL THEY GET BETTER. NOW WHERE CAN WE PUT THEM SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THE SERVICES AND A THE HELP THAT THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. AND AGAIN I I THINK PART OF THE THE FUNDING PROBLEM IN THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE HAVING HERE. IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT VISION. AND SO. THEY LIKE I APOLOGIZE CAME A LITTLE LATE MAYBE YOU DID SHARE YOUR VISION OF WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. I KNOW SUMMERTIME IS IS REALLY MACRO BUT I LIKE TO GET IN TWO WEEKS -- OF WHAT. TYPE OF A PERSON WILL BE. TAKING CARE TO YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROFESSIONS WOULD DEPRIVE SKILL SETS WITH THE WHAT DO WE NEED. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL. BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN BILL LET pIMPORTANT THING WHAT GOES ON INSIDE. SO I AM A I'M I'M HOPING THAT I CAN GET. OR WITH THIS COMMITTEE AT LEAST CAN GET SOME SOME UNDERSTANDING OF OF WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS SO THAT WHEN WE DO VOTE. AND WE DO PUT MONEY TOWARDS THIS IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A WHOLE OTHER JUST MONTHS LATER THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO CAME TODAY THANKS SO THOSE OF YOU WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATION -- I THINK WHEN WE ALL HEARD THAT OF THIS RECOMMENDATION AND THE EARLY PART OF THE YEAR WE WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE WAS NOT -- THE WE HAD NOT DO NOT HAVE SI A PLAN. BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS JUST A STATEMENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITHOUT ANY REAL. IDEA OF HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE WHETHER THEY BE A THOROUGH PROCESS ALL THOUGHTFUL PROCESS IN DOING THIS AND OF OF WE JUST GOT THE RECOMMENDATION LAST FRIDAY. SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY THAT THAT BECAUSE WE WERE ON BREAK. FOR THE LAST WEEK SO WE'VE HAD NOT HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY THOROUGHLY LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL WHICH WE WILL DO. AND LOOK AT WITH REGARDS TO WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. MOST OF OUR CONCERNS LEASE MY CONCERN INITIALLY WAS AS MANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE SAID ALREADY. THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE JUST A SIMPLE PLACEMENT OF ONE INSTITUTION INTO A OF UNDER THE OFF UP UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANOTHER INSTITUTION -- THAT NOT THAT THAT OF THE INSTITUTION IS ALL THAT GREAT YOU KNOW I MEAN SO AS A RESULT IT YOU KNOW THE IMPLICATION OBVIOUSLY WAS THAT THIS SHOULD BE A CHANGE IN. PHILOSOPHY OF HOW WE OPERATE AND WHAT WE HANDLE AND HOW WE DEAL WITH IT IN HOW WE VIEW. THE THE ACTIVITIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN IN CALIFORNIA AND AND AND THAT'S AND SEE AN RESULTS I A I A PROBLEMS. WITH WITH ALL OF THE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- IN TERMS OF HOW WE OPERATE PERIOD I'D YOU KNOW AND WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S AN ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE -- IT'S NOT ONLY IN THERE BUT IT'S THROUGHOUT OUR OTHER SYSTEMS AS WELL I FIND IT APPALLING. OF THAT WE TOLERATE THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SYSTEMS AND THAT WE BRAG ABOUT IT. AND I SAY WHEN I SAY BRAG ABOUT IT I MEAN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT -- ON EACH OTHER THE PHYSICAL ASSAULT ON EACH OTHER IN IN WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS YOU KNOW SOMEONE GOING ANSWERS ALL YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO AND SO'S GIRLFRIEND WHEN YOU GET THERE. THAT'S A STATEMENT ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT EVEN IF WE MAKE THAT STATEMENT EITHER IN COURT OR IN IN IN IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THIS IS WE TOLERATE THIS WE TOLERATE THIS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE. THAT OCCURS AND IT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO REHABILITATE WILL BRING THEM BACK INTO SOCIETY THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TAKE A MENTAL PLACE IS GOING TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE VICTIMS. MORE DEFENSIVE AND FIGHT MORE SO I MEAN SO THIS IS I THINK WE HAVE A A WAYS TO GO IN TERMS OF THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THIS NATION PERIOD IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM. THAT IS BASICALLY PUNITIVE AND PEOPLE INTEREST AND BECOME WORSE RATHER THAN BETTER AND MOST MOST OF THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG FAMILY THAT INTERVENES THE ONES I'VE SEEN HAVE COME OUT. A VERY VERY STRONG FAMILIES AND OF INTERVENE AND AND AND TRIED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT PERSON'S LIFE WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT IF IT RELIES UPON THE SYSTEM TO REHABILITATE THEM THEN IT GENTLY DOESN'T HAPPEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN -- I WAS IN ANY EVENT YESTERDAY AND IN LOS ANGELES -- VISITING WITH FAMILY SAID IN A DINNER AND I HAD JUST INQUIRED OF SOME YOUNG PEOPLE AND I THINK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE MY EAST NOW. BUT THE LITTLE BIT YOUNGER AS TO WHERE ARE THEY AND THESE ARE KIDS WHO HAD -- OF FRIENDS SOME FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHERS WHO HAD OFTEN BEEN INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY WORK. WHAT WERE THEY DOING I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT COMING ITS MEETING I JUST WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE I HADN'T SEEN HIM IN AWHILE? AND NOT A ONE OF THEM WAS DOING WELL. NOT A ONE OF THOSE WHO WEREN'T INCARCERATED WERE IN SEVERE PAIN HEALTH ISSUES. OF WHERE THEY WERE -- YOU KNOW IN THEIR LATE FORTIES EARLY FIFTIES AND YET IN WITH AND CONVALESCENT HOMES. I HAVE WERE VICTIMS OBVIOUSLY A CONSTANT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND AS A RESULT IT HAD DESTROYED MUCH OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS A HOST OF OTHER THINGS. SO NOT A PERSON NOT A ONCE IT THIS PERSON IS DOING REALLY WELL. EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM HAD SOME PROBLEMS OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEM. AND IT WAS REALLY QUITE SAD THAT I REMEMBER THEM AS CHILDREN -- GETTING INVOLVED IN LITTLE ACTIVITIES AND DOING THINGS THAT WERE WRONG -- AND NOW AS I LOOK AT THEIR LIVES AT THE AFTER FORTY FIFTY YEARS. AND WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PROCESS OF ALL THESE ACTIVITIES NOTHING TURNED OUT GOOD. NOTHING NOT A PERSON SAID TO ME ABOUT ANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I KNOW. OF THERE WAS SOME RELATIVES AND SOME FRIENDS THAT THEIR LIVES ARE BETTER. THAT THEY JUST LIVING A NORMAL LIFE EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM WAS UNDER THE CARE OF SOMEONE ELSE FOR SOME HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH. OR MENTAL HEALTH SITUATION AND ONE WAS INCARCERATED. AND IT WAS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND I WE WAS SO SAD -- TO REMEMBER THESE THE THIS THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO KNOW THE NOT A ONE HEADED GOOD OUTCOME. AS A RESULT OF BEING IN THE SYSTEMS THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND SO IT'S REALLY QUITE SAD FOR ME I MEAN I LEFT THAT EVENT JUST REALLY DEPRESSED. AND IT YET THOUGH A LOT OF OLD FOLKS ABOUT WAS DOING EXTREMELY WELL. BUT THOSE OF THAT I REMEMBER WHO WERE VICTIMS OF A WHOLE LOT OF DRAMA IN THEIR LIVES -- WITH THIS FROM THE FAMILIES OF REAL IS WHATEVER IT WAS A SCHOOL OF MANY OF THEM WERE COSTLY TAUNTED AT SCHOOL AND KICKED OUT ALL THE TIME AND NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY AT ISSUES. NOTHING GOOD CAME FROM THEM NONE OF THEM EVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEY ALL HAD SEVERE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL PROBLEMS AND IT BOTHERED ME SO THAT I TOLD MY SISTER I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO VISIT THEM WHEN I GO BACK TO LA. AND JUST SEE IF IS THIS LATE IN LIFE IF I COULD TAKE A LUNCH OR DINNER OR SOMETHING I MEAN. IT WAS VERY VERY TRAUMATIC FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS THE PRODUCT. OF THE SYSTEM THAT I THINK CLINTON SAID LONG TIME AGO SYSTEMS CANNOT RAISE CHILDREN. FAMILIES RAISE CHILDREN. AND WE SAID THAT WHEN CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT AND WE STILL ARE TRYING TO LET SYSTEMS RAISE CHILDREN OR SOMEONE SAID TO ME ONCE WHEN WE WERE TALKING THEY SAID ALL THE KIDS ARE WE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH. OUR WERE ONCE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNTIES OF OF THE STATE BECAUSE ALL OF THEM HAVE SOME KIND OF SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES. AND SO IN SO WE HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE I I WENT TO I WAS IN GHANA ONCE FOR PROGRAM JUST TO VISIT AND I WHEN I GO I KNOW ME TRIED TO SOME GOOD ONE ON THERE. AND THEN JUST VACATION. AND I WENT TO A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM A PROGRAM. AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW IT DRIVING DOWN THE STREET IT WAS LIKE A BIG HOUSE SEVERAL HOUSES. ON IN THIS BLOCK AND THERE WAS NO GATE NOBODY LOCKED UP SO FOR THE SOMEONE. AND THEY WERE NUMBER OF YOUNG LADIES IN THIS IN THIS FACILITY AND THEIR PHILOSOPHY WAS THAT THESE KIDS HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG. BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES AND THE SOCIETY HAVE FAILED THEM. AND SO THEIR TASK WAS TO TRY TO RE BILL. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES. THEIR ANSWER UNCLES AND COUSINS OF WHATEVER AND TO REBUILD THE SOME PEOPLE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE FAMILY. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING OF THE THE KIDS WERE TAKING CLASSES THEY WERE LEARNING. TO SO WHEN I WENT TO WINS WOMEN'S THING THEY WERE LEARNING IS A SKILLED IN A TRADE TO SO. THEY HAD SOME COUNSELORS THEIR THEIR FAMILIES VISITED THEM OFTEN. YOU KNOW AND THAT WAS COUNSELING FOR FAMILIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT WAS THERE BECAUSE THEIR PHILOSOPHY WAS. IN THIS SOCIETY THE GOOD NAY INSISTS THAT IT THAT IS THE FAMILY THAT'S THE CENTER. OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS AND AND YOU STRENGTH IN THAT FAMILY AND THOSE RELATIVES IN THE CONNECTION THAT'S THERE AND THAT THE FAMILY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILDREN. AND WHEN WHEN THINGS GO AWRY THEY DO THEIR BEST TO TRY TO REBUILD THOSE FAMILIES. AND SO I WENT TO A WOMEN'S FACILITY AND THEN I WENT TO ONE I SHOULDN'T SAY A FACILITY BECAUSE REALLY WASN'T AND THEN I WENT TO ONE OF WITH THE HEAD MALES. TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF HOW YOU DEAL WITH WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES. AND SO I THOUGHT I'D I LEFT THE THINK IN WOW YOU KNOW THIS IS A WORLD AWAY FROM US YEAH THIS IS WOULD BE CONSIDERED A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. DEALING WITH ITS OWN CHILDREN AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO TRY TO REBUILD THOSE LIVES FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE FAMILIES THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THAT. SO WE HAVE GOT I I I AGREE WITH MY STAFF WE NEED TO HAVE A PHILOSOPHY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO -- I WHAT I AM STILL CONCERNED THAT WOULD THERE HAVE THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE VARIOUS ENTITIES AND THE FINANCES AS TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TALKING ABOUT BUILDING IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IT. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU WILL MOVE IT TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU MOVE IT TO WHETHER THIS IS A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY. OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AT SOME POINT A PUBLIC SAFETY WHETHER THEY'D RATHER THAN JUST SHIFTING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER THAN DISCOVERING THAT WOULD TOTALLY INADEQUATE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE SOME SERVICES WE HAD OVER HERE. THAT WE NEED OVER THERE AND SO I I I'M HOPING AND AND CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME IN DEPTH CONVERSATION -- I DON'T PLAN DOUBLE FOR A MOVE OF ANYTHING THAT IS NOT US SO I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SOME TIME OR US TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. WITH THE ADVOCATES AS WELL AS WITH THOSE IN FINANCE I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT EVER BECAUSE AND FINANCE BECAUSE I FIGURED IF WE LIKE IT AND WE LOVE IT WILL FUND YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST KIND OF THING SO. I'M NOT IS IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL PIECE I GUESS YOU GUYS WILL TELL US WHAT IT COST US AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BIGGER BUT BECAUSE MY BELIEF IS THAT IF WE DO IT AND WOOD RIGHT. EVEN IF IT COSTS US MORE IN THE FRONT AND IT WILL COST US LESS ON THE BACK. AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DID NOT TRYING TO MAKE PERMANENT CRIMINALS AND A PERMANENT COST. OF THIS THERE'S STILL THAT EVEN IF IT'S IF IT'S IF IT COSTS US MORE IN THE IN THE BENEFITS THAT WE REAP TO HAVING. ACTIVE PRODUCTIVE OF RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIFE OF CALIFORNIA IS FAR BETTER THAN HAVING A PIPELINE TO THE BIGGEST PRISON THAT WE CAN FIND FOR THEM -- IN TERMS OF THE COST THAT'S THERE AND SO FORTH AS WELL AS A SPENDING A FORTUNE RIGHT NOW. ON JUVENILE JUSTICE AND AND YOU KNOW THE MOUNT PEOPLE TELL ME WE SPEND I COULD TAKE A FAMILY GIVEN AND MONEY THEY GET A HOUSE. AND LIVE GOOD EATEN AND MAYBE TAKE EVERYBODY YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF STUFF I MEAN REALITY IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN A ONE THESE KIDS THEIR FAMILIES DON'T MAKE. IT AS AS INCOME AND SO THAT IN ITSELF IS FRIGHTENING -- TO YEAH YOU KNOW THEIR FAMILIES -- MAKE TO A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND AND SO AS A RESULT WE COULD PROBABLY A WHOLE LOT BETTER TO REBUILD FAMILIES AND LIVES -- WITH THIS RATHER THAN WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING BUT BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC I'M GOING TO BE THE OPTIMIST IN THE ROOM ALWAYS. THAT IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING DO IT RIGHT WELL IT TAKES TIME -- IT TAKES COMMITMENT WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS IN LINE WHO GOES GIVE US THEIR DEFINITION -- JUST THE ONE STATEMENT OF WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY'RE FROM -- BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. SOMETIMES BY THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED -- BUT I THINK WE ARE HEADED IN THE GOOD DIRECTION AND I THINK AS LONG AS WITH BIT. TO MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT WE REALLY HAVE A VISION OF SOMETHING COME TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE I THINK WE'LL BE FINE WE'LL BE FINE SOMEONE MOST BRILLIANT KIDS OF A MATTER IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS SOMETIMES FRIGHTENING TO ME. HOW SMART THEY ARE AND AND AND -- AND I THINK SOMETIMES THAT'S WHY THEY THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SMART THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE SO THIS IS WHAT THIS IS HOW THEY HANDLE. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A NUMBER PURCHASE A WANT TO GIVE US THEIR NAME. AND WITH A FAVORABLE TO POSTED WHAT ORGANIZATION AND WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR LONG.

AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ASKING FOR MORE STAFF WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR THE MOVE TO CONTINUE AS PROJECTED WITHOUT ANY STEPS BEING TAKEN TO STABILIZE THE POPULATION AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT.

TO BEST DO THAT THIS IS OF A HISTORIC SHIFT IT'S AN IMPORTANT SHIFT AND CAN'T BE DONE OVERNIGHT AND CAN'T BE DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES -- WHERE WE'VE SEEN THE PAST TEN YEARS 60% DROPS AND -- DETENTION RATES AND OVER 70% DROPS IN JUVENILE ARREST RATES AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT SAME PATH THANK YOU.

AND ALSO A GRADUATE OF THE JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE I TOTALLY SUPPORT. THE MOVE FROM DJJ. TO MORE -- HEALTH BASED APPROACH AND ALSO THAT JUST MOVING DJJ IS NOT ENOUGH -- I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THE MEMO THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO I'M NORMA WITH THE OTHER BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND I'M JUST HERE IN SUPPORT AND ALSO TO STATE THAT THIS MOVE IS NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE CAGED UP THAT IS NOT. A REHABILITATIVE PROCESS AND FOLKS OF MENTAL ILLNESS DO NOT SHOULD NEVER BE IN PRESIDENT -- SO DO TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION WE DO SUPPORT IT BUT WE DO NEED TO GO FURTHER THANK YOU. DEREK MORGAN SPEAKING AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN OF OAKLAND BUT ALSO FOR THE BECAUSE CENTER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO URGE YOU TO NOT FORGET -- THAT. WE ARE HERE FOR A REASON AT C. W. A. N. D. TODAY SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM REHABILITATION BECAUSE OF THEIR PAST PROMISE THAT THEY'VE CAUSED AND THEIR BACKSLIDING INTO THAT CLIMATE OF ABUSE. I URGE YOU TO ALSO LOOK AT CURRENT FUNDING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S OVERSIGHT FOR THE CURRENT PROCESSES AND GRANT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING -- AND ONE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OP PROCESS WILL BE LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL THAT IS COME FORWARD THAT WE SEE -- WE'RE NOT INTERESTED AS WANTED OUT IN COSMETIC CHANGES BUT REAL STRONG SYSTEMIC CHANGE THAT WOULD UP PRODUCE FOR US -- OF THE DIFFERENT RESULTS SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL AS KIND OF SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE MUCH MORE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUNG PEOPLE THEN CURRENTLY THE SYSTEM THAT WE DO HAVE -- IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO ARE ENVISIONING AND THINKING OF THIS THAT WOULD NOT LOCK OURSELVES INTO BEING COMMITTED TO THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. YOU KNOW I HEAR THIS OFTEN WHERE ANY TIME A GOOD WAY TO MAKE CHANGE EVERYBODY THINKS EVERYBODY WHO'S EMPLOYED. IN A SYSTEM HAS TO ALSO MOVE WITH THE NEW SYSTEM AND THAT. IN THE EFFORT TO TRY TO DO THAT YOU LIMIT YOUR VISION. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM BUT IF IT IF I TASK IS TO TAKE ALL THE FOLKS WHO WORK. IN A CERTAIN SYSTEM AND PUT THEM BACK INTO THE NEW SYSTEM WE WILL END UP WITH THE SAME SYSTEM AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE REAL CHALLENGE. IS HOW DO WE ENVISION SOMETHING WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING A FACTORY IN THAT ELEMENT KNOWING THAT THOSE THINGS WILL WILL WORK THEIR WAY OUT AND WILL EVENTUALLY COME TO BE BUT IF THEY BECOME THE FOUNDATION. FOR THE STRUCTURE. YOU KNOW IF IF EVERYONE WHO'S EMPLOYED CURRENTLY WITH DJJ IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE STRUCTURE YOU'RE GONNA LIMIT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BECAUSE THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT'S ROUND AND YOU'VE GOT A SQUARE PEG IT MAY NOT FIT IN. YOU KNOW IT JUST MAY NOT AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR GOALS ARE CLEAR. OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. HAVE THE CREATIVITY IN THE VISION AND THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU TALK ABOUT PERSONNEL. BUT OFTENTIMES IN THIS PLACE WE TALK ABOUT PERSONAL FIRST. AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT OTHER STUFF AND TRY TO MAKE IT WORK AND IT NEVER SEEMS TO WORK I RUN INTO THIS ALL THE TIME WITH SCHOOLS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOTTA WORK BUT MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S THERE AND THEN AS A RESULT THE KIDS DON'T GET WHAT THEY NEED. SO WE WANT TO BASICALLY RELEASE OURSELVES FROM THAT ****. AND REALIZE THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS CREATING A VISION OF WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM SHOULD EXIST. AND IT AS A RESULT OF THAT HOW WHAT IS A PERSONAL NECESSARY TO SUPPORT AND DRIVE THAT SYSTEM AND I HOPE THAT'S THE VISION THAT WOULD GO AWAY. OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S THERE. THIS WILL COME BACK THIS IS NOT BEEN FUNDED YET IS BEING HELD OVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OUR FINAL ITEM I BELIEVE IS FINAL IS THAT RIGHT IT IS ARE THESE OFFICES TRADING POST IS HERE -- YES SOME PEOPLE FAMOUS OKAY.

LOCAL ASSISTANCE AN AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT OF TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION. UNFORTUNATELY DISPLAYING THE FUNDING IN THE B. C. P. UTILIZING THESE CATEGORIES DOES NOT CLEARLY DELINEATE HOW CLOSE WE UTILIZE THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR USE OF FORCE. DE ESCALATION AND MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING. I IF YOU WOULD LIKE I CAN GO INTO SPECIFICS ON HOW WE AND EXPECT TO USE THAT MONEY OR I CAN. ANSWER QUESTIONS WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE MADAM CHAIR I KNOW YOU KNOW. A LOT OF THIS BUT I'M. RIGHT CAN YOU TO I'M PREPARED TO CONTINUE IF YOU LIKE WELL THEY'RE NOT HERE SO -- AND I'VE I'VE HEARD OF ABOUT IT BEFORE MY STAFF S. SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE FINE WITH THE THAT WILL THAT THE THE OF THIS RESPOND. TO OF FINANCE HAVING A RESPONSE. HELLO. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DO HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU ON THIS ISSUE. THE FIRST IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND ONGOING LEVEL FUNDING IS OVER 60%. AND TO REALLY IT WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE FOR SHOULD FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT WHATEVER FUNDING IS PROVIDED CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND IT REFLECTS -- THEIR THOUGHTS. THE PLAN THAT'S BEEN LAID OUT AND AND DISCUSSED IS ONE WAY. OF USING THE DOLLARS IT'S A THOUGHTFUL WAY POST REALLY REAL VALUE IN THE PROGRAMS ETCETERA. BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN PRIOR YEARS INDICATED ALTERNATIVE WAYS THEY WANTED TO DEDICATE FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES AND THAT'S AN EQUALLY ACCEPTABLE WAY OF USING THE DOLLARS. SO OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER FINDINGS PROVIDED WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING ANNUAL REPORTING. ON SPECIFIC OUTCOME IN PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE TIED TO ANY NEW FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED. AND SO THIS WILL REALLY HELP THE LEGISLATURE MONITOR THAT THE FUNDS ARE USED YOU KNOW IN THE COURTS OF LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS. TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THEM AND THIS TYPE OF DATA WILL ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD DETERMINE WHAT'S THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF DELIVERING SERVICES. AND IF ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS PROVIDED THE FUTURE WHERE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO INVEST THOSE DOLLARS THANK YOU. IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL THANK YOU. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE YES. THIRTY SOME JEWS. THERE WE GO GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR SHOWN ON WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING -- AND OUR VIEWS -- LONG OVERDUE NAME INVESTMENT INTO LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY ACROSS A CALIFORNIA AS A PRIMARILY TRAINING ORGANIZATION IF THERE'S ANY INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE ABOUT WHO WE'VE. TRAINED IN SOME OUTCOMES EITHER THROUGH THE LA. ELIAS'S RECOMMENDATION WE WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT -- WHEN THIS ITEM COMES BEFORE VOTE BUT -- IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING INCIDENT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR LUCIA MUCH LEARNED HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ARE WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL PROPOSE FUNDING.

OKAY WANT TO THANK POST FOR PROVIDING US WITH THIS INFORMATION -- IT WAS INTERESTING I WAS IN A MEETING THIS MORNING CONCERNING -- POLICE OFFICER TRAINING AND SOMEONE SAYS WELL YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN HIM ANY MONEY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS HILARIOUS AND I SAID TO YOU LAST YEAR GIVING TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH IS 50% OF THEIR CURRENT BUDGET -- YOU KNOW SO THEY'VE SEEN AN INCREASE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE AN INCREASE AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WE HAVE TO TIE THAT MONEY WHICH WE DID INITIALLY. TO ISSUES OF DE ESCALATION AS WELL AS FOR PROVIDE INNOVATIVE GRANTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF EXCITING THINGS HAPPENING IN IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. AND A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY HELP SOME GO ALONG WAY WITH USE OF DRONES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A SAFER COMMUNITY.
