GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF SENATOR JACKSON LIKE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWELVE A ONE THE BILL THAT FILLS AN IMPORTANT GAP IN EXISTING LAW REGARDING. PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH TRANSLATED VERSIONS OF MORTGAGE LOAN AND CREDIT EXTENSION DOCUMENTS. MORTGAGE LOANS AND EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT ARE SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WILL MAKE IN THEIR LIFETIME. FOR CONSUMERS WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. LANGUAGE BARRIER ADDS YET ANOTHER LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY TO AN ALREADY COMPLEX PROCESS. THIS LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THIS CHALLENGE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND RESPONDED WITH ASSEMBLY BILL. ELEVEN FIFTY WHICH REQUIRED KEY TERMS OF MORTGAGE LOAN ENTRANCE LIKE THAT EXTENSION AGREEMENTS. TO BE TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH. CHINESE TAGALOG VIETNAMESE OR KOREAN. IF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY NEGOTIATED AND ONE OF THOSE LANGUAGES. HOWEVER ELEVEN FIFTY WAS SILENT REGARDING -- WHETHER CHANCELLOR XIN SHOULD BE. PROVIDED IF THE AGREEMENTS WERE RENEGOTIATED IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE OBTAINED A MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATION IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. AS WE 12-1 FILLS THIS GAP BY REQUIRING SUPERVISE FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE BORROWERS WITH TRANSLATED COPIES. KEY TERMS OF RENEGOTIATED LOAN AGREEMENTS IF THE RE NEGOTIATIONS WERE PRIMARILY CONDUCTED IN SPANISH CHINESE TAGALOG VIETNAMESE OR KOREAN. AMENDMENTS TAKEN EARLIER IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS CONFIRMED THAT THE DEBATES DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT SHOW MAKE THESE TRANSLATIONS. OF KILO PROVISIONS AVAILABLE TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AT NO COST. AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE'RE PLEASED TO SAY THAT THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION. S. B. TWELVE OR ONE ALSO ENSURES DUE PROCESS FOR LICENSEES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDING ACT. AT FACING LICENSE REVOCATION FOR FAILING TO FILE A FINANCIAL REPORT. NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT BY ENTITLING THEM TO A HEARING UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. A BY REQUIRING THE DVD OUT TO VACATE A REVOCATION ORDER IF THE DEPARTMENT FAILS TO PROVIDE THAT HEARING WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF ITS INITIAL ORDER.

FOR YOU TO ACCESS THE WEB SITES OF OUR COMPETITORS THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- MAY OUT WE KNOW THAT THE ICE PLEASE HAVE A HISTORY. OF ENGAGING IN THIS BEHAVIOR WHETHER IT IS A TNT AND OTHER COMPANIES BLOCKING GOOGLE WALLET WHETHER IT IS A TNT BLOCKING SKYPE AND FACE TIME. WHETHER IT IS AN I. S. P. BLOCKING A UNION ORGANIZING WEBSITE. NOT NEUTRALITY IS ABOUT WHO GETS TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS ON THE INTERNET AS A PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME AS CONSUMERS. IS THAT PEOPLE COMPETING AS INNOVATORS OR IS THAT. INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS GET TO THE SIDE. WINNERS AND LOSERS -- IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T LEAD WHICH IT WON'T. I CALIFORNIA MUST LEAD. AND WE MUST PASS A ROBUST. BILL THAT PROTECTS NET NEUTRALITY. NOT ANOTHER TRIAL THE BILL IN NAME ONLY. A REAL NET NEUTRALITY BILL. WE WORKED FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS ON SBA. TWENTY TWO WORKING WITH FORMER FCC OFFICIALS -- WITH COMPUTER SCIENCE EXPERTS ARE WITH PEOPLE WHO REALLY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. TAKE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA NET NEUTRALITY ORDER THE ONE THAT TRUMP'S FCC REPEALED. AND THE CRAFT THAT INTO A GOOD BILL AND WE DID THAT AND WE INTRODUCED A I THAT BILL HAS ENORMOUS. SUPPORT. INCLUDING FROM TOM WHEELER WHO IS OBAMA'S FCC CHAIRMAN WHO WROTE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. NANCY PELOSI OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL HOBBY OVER SARAH. AND YOU'LL HEAR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THE CEO YOU WESTERN CENTER. LIKE ON A FRONTIER FOUNDATION THE LA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND SO FORTH THE OPPOSITION. THE TNT COMCAST VERIZON. COMPANIES WHOSE INTEREST IS PROTECTING THEIR SHAREHOLDERS NOT PROTECTING CONSUMERS. S. B. TWENTY TWO BEFORE LAST WEEK COMPREHENSIVELY PROTECTED NET NEUTRALITY. THERE WAS A MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS OF AND FLOODING ACROSS THIS BUILDING I'M SURE YOU'RE OFFICES HAVE BEEN INUNDATED. WITH LOBBYISTS AFTER LOBBYIST SPREADING INACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL. MEN INFORMATION MISINFORMATION OF COURSE THERE ARE THE ASSERTIONS THAT THE BILL SOMEHOW WENT BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA ORDER IT DID NOT. UNFORTUNATELY LAST WEDNESDAY AS I THINK YOU KNOW -- THE COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE COMMITTEE -- GUIDED THIS BILL. TURN IT INTO A BILL THAT NO LONGER ACTUALLY PROTECT NET NEUTRALITY. THE COMMITTEE DELETED MOST OF THE BILL'S CORPORATE TAX SENDS. PROTECTING THROUGHOUT INTERCONNECTION AROUND PROHIBITIONS ON ACCESS FEES -- AROUND PLAYING FAVORITES WITH THE HIGHEST HIS OWN WEBSITES VERSUS OTHER WEBSITES. ON ALLOWING A THROTTLING OF ENTIRE CLASSES OF APPLICATION LIKE OF A TELECOM DOESN'T WANT ANY INTERNET TELEPHONY. I AND SO FORTH. THE COMMITTEE STATED THAT IT WAS SCALING THE BILL BACK TO BE. CONSISTENT WITH THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. THAT IS NOT TRUE. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ACCURATE. THE BILL AS IT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY IT FALLS WELL SHORT OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU. THIS IS THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER THAT BARACK OBAMA'S FCC PAST HUNDREDS OF PAGES THAT WE WORK METHODICALLY TO BOIL DOWN. TO A BILL [inaudible] THE COMMITTEE. TOOK TO PAY THAT OUT OF IT. BEST TWO PAGES AND SAID THIS WAS THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AND BOILED THE BILL DOWN TO THESE TWO PAGES. INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TAKING THE PROTECTIONS. FROM THIS FULL ORDER I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND STAFF DID A FANTASTIC JOB THOROUGHLY GOING THROUGH AND POINTING TO ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAST COMMITTEE TOOK OUT OF OUR BILL. THAT WERE IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER IMPORTANT PROVISIONS. SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THAT -- SO I THE TODAY CONSUMERS ARE NOT PROTECTED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT PROTECTED AND THEY WILL GET STOMPED OUT OF EXISTENCE. BY THE BIG GUYS PEACE BECAUSE NOW BE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE COMPETING. AGAINST THE ISPS OWNED BUSINESSES. THE NETFLIX USING GOOGLE'S OF THE WORLD THEY'RE GONNA DO OKAY. THEY CAN PAY WHATEVER MONEY IS DEMANDED OF THEM THEY MAY NOT LIKE IT AND THEY DON'T AND IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY. BUT THEY CAN TIE. IT IS A SMALL BUSINESSES IF THE NEXT GENERATION OF NETFLIX'S AND RULES. THAT ARE GOING TO GET DESTROYED. WITH A LOCK OF NET NEUTRALITY. I SO WHAT I AM ASKING TODAY CALLING ON I WOULD LOVE IT I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN -- IF WE COULD JUST RESTORE REVERSE ALL THE AMENDMENTS FROM LAST WEEK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST OUTCOME. I'M A REALIST OF SO WHAT I AM ASKING IS FOR THE COMMITTEE. OUGHT TO PASS SB A TWENTY TWO IN ITS CURRENT -- GUIDED FORM OUT OF THE CAN AN OPPORTUNITY. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AND OTHERS TO TRY TO RESTORE THE BILL WE HAVE OUR MISTER SANTIAGO AND I HAVE AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER. IN GOOD FAITH I TRY -- TO UNDO THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE LAST WEEK AYE WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK BUT I NEED THIS VEHICLE TO MOVE FORWARD IN ORDER TO DO THAT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING -- I'M JOINED BY THREE WITNESSES TODAY OF BARBARA VENCIDA COUP THE STANFORD LAW PROFESSOR AND COMPUTER SCIENCE PHD. WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS SPACE OFFER A VERY VERY LONG TIME. ON WHICH SIDE OR FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND STEVEN RENDER SAN FROM THE CENTER FOR MEDIA JUSTICE THANK YOU. ATTIC BROUGH THANK YOU VERY MUCH EFFORTS WITNESS PLEASE. BUT YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ARE IN A POSITION OF SUPPORT IF AMENDED BACK TO THE VERSION OF THE BILL AS IT WAS ON JUNE ELEVENTH AS AS THE ULTIMATE YOU REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT VERSION. EITHER MEETS A REASONABLE DEFINITION OF NET NEUTRALITY AND WE FEEL IT FAILS TO PROTECT OUR RIGHT TO ORGANIZE ON AND IT'S ESPECIALLY CONCERNING IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE ATTACKS THAT WERE FACING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF BAD U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ONE OF WHICH IS GOING TO COME TOMORROW. BAD NLRB DECISIONS AND A VARIETY OF OTHER ATTACKS ON HEALTH AND SAFETY IN WAGE AND HOUR THAT WE'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW THAT ARE VERY MUCH. ERODING BASIC RIGHTS THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE FOUGHT LITERALLY DIED FOR AND REALLY OUR ONLY HOPE TO DEFEND THESE RIGHTS IN MANY CASES IS TO ORGANIZE. IS TO COME TOGETHER AS WORKERS COMMUNIQUE PLACE AND TRY TO FIND WAYS TO DO THINGS BETTER. AND THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW -- THAT ALLOWS FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT CONFLICT WITH THAT BECAUSE THE REALITY IS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A LOT OF THE ORGANIZING HAPPENS ONLINE. AND THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR ACCESS FEES THAT'LL MAKE THE INTERNET MORE EXPENSIVE IT ALLOWS FOR SLOWING IN BLOCKING AT THE POINT OF INTERCONNECTION. THAT COULD VERY POSSIBLY JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE ONLINE AND WILL ENSURE THE OPPOSITION IS GOING TO COME UP HERE AND TELL YOU ALL ABOUT. WHY THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO DO ANYTHING OF THE SORT THE REALITY IS THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE GROUP OF WORKERS ORGANIZING? A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY CALLED TELLUS IN CANADA -- ACTUALLY DID BLOCK WORKERS ACCESS TO WEBSITE THAT THEY WERE USING TO ORGANIZE AND SO WE WE JUST ASK THAT. COMMITTEE MEMBERS KEEP THAT IN MIND AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF A RIGHT TO ORGANIZE IN THE FACE OF ALL THESE FEDERAL TAX AND HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT THE BILL CAN LOOK MORE LIKE A DEAD ON JULY. THANK YOU MY CHAIR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. SO THANKS FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY -- LAST WEEK THAT COMMITTEE COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE COMMITTEE CUT KEY PARTS OF THE BILL. REMOVING MANY IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS AND CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING IT BACK. AND THAT REALLY RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WHICH IS WHAT OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIANS SHOULD A LOT SHOULD ENJOY. SO FIRST SHOULD CALIFORNIA CONSONANTS HAVE AN INTERNET WEB THAT STATES NEED TO PAY FEES TO THE OUR CUSTOMERS ICED TEAS. A RISK BEING BLOCKED FROM THE CONSUMERS WHO VIEW. IS THAT HOW WE WANT THE INTERNET TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA. I THAT MEANS EIGHTEEN TI WOULD BE FREE TO CHARGE EVERY WEBSITE DEFEAT JUST TO BE VISIBLE TO EIGHTEEN TO SUBSCRIBERS AND BLOCK THOSE WEBSITES THAT DON'T PAY THE FEES. SO IF THE LA TIMES DIDN'T PAY EIGHTEEN TO DEFEAT IT WOULD NOT BE ACCESSIBLE TO CUSTOMIZE OF EIGHTEEN TEAS INTERNET SERVICE. THAT'S NOT HOW THE INTERNET HAS WORKED. TODAY CARDS YOU MUST PAY THE ICE P. TO GET ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE INTERNET. NOT JUST TO THE WEBSITES THAT HAVE PAID THE I SP. IN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THE FCC DECIDED IT SHOULD STAY THAT WAY AND PROHIBITED THESE. S. B. EIGHT TO TO DO IT SO AS WELL AND NOW AND YOU NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER CALIFORNIANS SHOULD CONTINUE TO ENJOY THESE. FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU. MISTER SHARE MEMBERS MY NAME STEVEN AND THOSE ON THE ORGANIZING DIRECTOR AT THE CENTER FOR MEDIA JUSTICE LA WHERE IN OAKLAND BASED RACIAL JUSTICE ACTION CENTER. THE FIGHTS FOR THE DIGITAL RIGHTS OF POOR PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE UNITED STATES -- CENTER FOR MEDIA JUSTICE -- HAS ADVOCATED FOR NET NEUTRALITY FOR THE LAST DECADE -- INCLUDING FIGHTING FOR THE STRONG PROTECTIONS THAT IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OPEN INTERNET ORDER. UP BEFORE IT WAS GOT IT LAST WEEK SB. EIGHT SAME OPEN INTERNET PART ACTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND I AM HERE TO URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND SUPPORT ALL EFFORTS TO RESTORE THE ORIGINAL PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL. ON THE CENTER FOR MEDIA JUSTICE FIGHTS FOR NET NEUTRALITY NOT BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO BITS AND BYTES. ON BUT BECAUSE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NET NEUTRALITY IS A CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE. AND FOR THOSE OUTRAGE BY THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES AT THE BORDER -- OR UPSET OVER -- TODAY'S SUPREME COURT DECISION AROUND THE MUSLIM BAN AND THE INTERNET IS GOING TO BE THE PLACE WE CAN CHANNEL OUR OUTRAGE. BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED S. B. A TWENTY TWO COMPREHENSIVELY PROTECTED A LOT OF THESE VOICES THAT LIVE AT THE MARGINS. BUT I NEED TO HIGHLIGHT A PROTECTION IN THE BILL THAT IS CRUCIAL TO CMJ AS BE A TWENTY TWO WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED THE MOST EGREGIOUS FORMS OF AN OFTEN DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICE. KNOWN AS ZERO RATING THESE HARMFUL ON ZERO RATING SCHEMES PUSH INTERNET CUSTOMERS TO USE WEBSITES AND APPLICATIONS CHOSEN BY THEIR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER IN EXCHANGE EYES PEAS DO NOT COUNT THAT DATA AGAINST OUR CUSTOMERS DATA PLAN -- SO SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT THESE PLANS ARE GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HIGH WHICH IS I'M HERE TO SAY THAT DISCRIMINATION OF ANY FORM IS NEVER GOOD FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR -- I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO MOVE SB EIGHT TWENTY TWO FORWARD AND FIGHT TO BRING BACK THE CRITICAL PROTECTIONS REMOVED LAST WEEK THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE USED TO HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LEFT US SO IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS SO WE WOULD WELCOME. HIM HURT THEM IF BECAUSE OF DESIRE. WE HAVE MORE TESTIMONY WE THOUGHT HE SAID THAT WE CAN ONLY TALK. TOM WHICH LIKE YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LEFT OF YOUR TEN MINUTES TEN MINUTES TOTAL ON EACH SIDE. BUT THEY WERE [inaudible] OKAY SO. THE SECOND QUESTION AS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT IS THIS QUESTION OF WHERE WE ARE PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM NET NEUTRALITY VIOLATIONS. WE KNOW THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THIS PUPPY IN DOWN THIS PAAS BEFORE. FOR EXAMPLE THE FCC'S TWENTY TEN OPEN INTERNET RULES ONLY APPLY TO DATA AS IT TRAVELED ACROSS COMPRESS NETWORK. THEY DID NOT APPLY TO DATA AS IT ENTERS CON BECAUSE NETWORK FROM THE REST OF THE INTERNET. SO THE RULES ONLY BAND CON BECAUSE FROM SLOWING DOWN WHAT SETS AS THEY TRAVELED OVER CONGRESS NETWORK. AND SENSING A LOOPHOLE THE SIXTH LARGEST ICE PIECE FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN FOUND A WAY TO SLOW DOWN DATA AS IT AND HAVE BEEN NETWORKS. SIXTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS SUFFER AT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. EMPLOYEES COULDN'T CONNECT TO THE COMPANY'S NETWORK SCHOOLS COULDN'T UP OF THAT PAYROLL DATA SKY COSTS DROPPED AN ONLINE VIDEO STORE THAT. IN ITS TWENTY FIFTEEN OPEN INTERNET ORDER THE FCC FIX THAT PROBLEM AND IN ACTED A POLICY THAT ALLOWED IT TO STOP ICE PEACE FROM CIRCUMVENTING THE FCC'S NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS. AT THE POINT WHERE DATA AND TO SPEND AT WORK. THE PRIOR VISION OF SP EIGHT TO TWO DID SO AS WELL. SO NOW WE NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS IS A PROTECTION THAT CALIFORNIAN SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE. IF NOT WE ARE EFFECTIVELY SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY FOR ICE PIECE TO CIRCUMVENT THE BOLTS NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS AT THE POINT WHERE DATA AND TEST THE ICE CUBES NETWORK. HE IN THE CAPITAL WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE NEW VEHICLE NUANCES OF WHERE AND HOW THE FCC AND ACT AS THE TWENTY FIFTEEN NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. BUT IN THE END CALIFORNIA STONE CARE. THEY NO THEY JUST LOST THE TWENTY FIFTEEN PROTECTIONS AND THEY DON'T WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING THE BACK. ALL OF THEM. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE THESE PROTECTIONS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE HOPING YOU WILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION VERY MUCH -- OTHER ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE STEP FORWARD. TELL US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION OR ASSOCIATION.

OR IN SUPPORT OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL BUT TO URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATCH. OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. BECAUSE THE FAMOUS VOTER NAME. I WOULD APPRECIATE IS A WELCOME ANYTIME YOU'RE READY WE I'D. BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME'S BILL DIVINE AND I REPRESENT A T. AND T. I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. LET ME OPEN BY SAYING THAT EIGHTEEN ANTI SUPPORTS AN OPEN INTERNET. WE DO NOT BLOCK WEBSITES WE DO NOT CENSOR ONLINE CONTENT AND WE DO NOT DEGRADE INTERNET TRAFFIC. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE THEY ARE ENFORCEABLE BY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. AND FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THAT IS EXACTLY THE WAY WE HAVE RUN OUR NETWORK. WE OPPOSE SENATOR WIENERS ORIGINAL LANGUAGE AND WE ALSO OPPOSE THE AMENDED S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE INTERNET HAS BEEN THE MAJOR ECONOMIC ENGINE OF GROWTH. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THE INDUSTRY INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR AND INFRASTRUCTURE. RESULTING IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF EDUCATIONAL. ENTERTAINMENT AND ECONOMIC CHOICES FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE. WE'RE NOT ON THE THRESHOLD OF A SECOND WAVE OF OF A TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION. WITH THE INVENTION ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. WIRELESS NETWORKS. GIGABIT SPEEDS OVER FIBER. AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS. WE HAVE A A LOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO CORRECT OR AT LEAST SUGGESTS SOME OF THE THINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY ARE INACCURATE. STATEMENTS THAT EIGHT TWENTY TWO IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM HAVE BEEN GUIDED WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS THE CASE EIGHT TWENTY TWO WENT FAR BEYOND. THE NOT TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OBAMA FCC RULES. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WOULD HAVE BANNED LONG STANDING COMMERCIALLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS BETWEEN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WOULD HAVE SHIFTED THESE COSTS. FROM MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CONTENT COMPANIES TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. HERE'S WHAT THE OBAMA FCC SAID ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND I QUOTE. THIS ORDER DOES NOT APPLY THE OPEN INTERNET RULES TOO INTERCONNECTION. HE GOES ON TO STATE. QUOTE WE CONCLUDE THAT IT WOULD BE PREMATURE. TO ADOPT PRESCRIPTIVE RULES TO ADDRESS ANY PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ARISEN OR MAY ARISE UNQUOTE. MEMBERS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE OBAMA FCC DID NOT PROHIBIT ISPS FROM LONG STANDING INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS I MIGHT ADD [inaudible] INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN WITH THE INTERNET SINCE THE BIRTH OF THE INTERNET. THE SECOND ISSUE THAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT ZERO RATING. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WOULD HAVE ENDED. POPULAR CONSUMER DRIVEN ZERO READING PROGRAMS OR PROGRAMS DESCRIBED AS FREE DATA. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ESPECIALLY POPULAR AMONG YOUNG MINORITY AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT AT LEAST THREE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS ENJOY AS MUCH AS THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH IN SAVINGS BY USING FREE DATA OR ZERO RATING PROGRAMS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. THE OBAMA FCC IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LOOKED CLOSELY AT THIS ISSUE. AND SPECIFICALLY DID NOT PROHIBIT ZERO RATING PROGRAMS. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES PROCUREMENT THE OBAMA NET NEUTRALITY RULES DID NOT INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON PROCUREMENT FOR FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL PROCUREMENT [inaudible] PERIOD. AND THEN FINALLY THERE IS THE ISSUE OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION THE FREQUENTLY GET DISCOUNTED BOTH THE OBAMA TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FCC. AND THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY FCC INCLUDED FEDERAL PREEMPTION IN THEIR NET NEUTRALITY ORDERS. EVEN FCC CHAIRMAN TOM WHEELER WHO WAS QUOTED EARLIER RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF A SINGLE NATIONAL POLICY HE RECOGNIZED THE INTERNET ISN'T INTERSTATE SERVICE. IN HIS COMMERCIALS ORDER QUOTE WE REAFFIRMED THE COMMISSION'S LONG STANDING CONCLUSIONS. THAT BROADBAND NTERNET ACCESS SERVICE IS JURISDICTION EARLY INTERSTATE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES. WHILE INDIVIDUAL STATES MAY DISAGREE WITH THE F. C. C.'S LEGAL. AND POLICY JUDGMENTS. THE WAY TO EXPRESS THAT DISAGREEMENT. CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IS TO CHALLENGE THOSE JUDGMENTS IN COURT. AND BY THE WAY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL IS DOING HE IS JOINED IN LITIGATION WITH MULTIPLE OTHER STATES TO CHALLENGE THE FCC RULES. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING MEMBERS BOTH VERSIONS OF S. B. EIGHT THIRTY TO EIGHT TWENTY TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT HARM FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THE INTERNET ECONOMY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WOULD URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT TWO TWO TODAY -- LIKE MISTER DEVINE STATED FOR EIGHTEEN T. I WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE CTA DO IN FACT SUPPORT TO AN OPEN INTERNET. THEY ARE COMMITTED TO IT HEARING TO THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE A NET NEUTRALITY NO BLOCKING NO PROBABLY NO PAID PRIORITIZATION. HOWEVER WE CANNOT SUPPORT STATE LEVEL LEGISLATION THAT WILL SUBJECT THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO STATE BY STATE PATCHWORK LEGISLATION WHERE WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT RULES ON HOW TO GOVERN THE OPERATION AT THE NETWORKS -- WE DO IN FACT SUPPORT A FEDERAL SOLUTION ONE THAT WON'T BE CHANGED WHENEVER THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGES FROM ONE PARTY TO THE NEXT BUT WE DO NOT AND CANNOT SUPPORT STATE LEVEL LEGISLATION. AS POINTED OUT BY MISTER DEVINE S. B. EIGHT TO TWO DOZEN FAT GO BEYOND. THE TWENTY FIFTEEN FCC ORDER THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE UNDER THE PRESIDENT OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE LAST COMMITTEE I THINK WHEN A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING AND THOSE THINGS THAT WERE IN OVER REACH BEYOND THAT ORDER. BUT YOU STILL HAVE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL TODAY THAT CONTINUE TO GO BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER ONE OF THOSE ISSUES OF COURSES PROCUREMENT AT STATE LEVEL PROCUREMENT. AND THE OTHER IS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF APPS ACTION THAT THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS WOULD IN FACT BE SUBJECT. TO UNDER THE PROVISIONS OUT OF S. B. EIGHT THAT IN AND OF ITSELF MEANS THAT NOT ONLY WOULD BE BE WE BE SUBJECT TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS WE ARE TO DAY. FOR THE PUBLIC COMMITMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE WE WOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION OF FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S MULTIPLE CITY ATTORNEYS AND OF COURSE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY CONSUMERS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SUBJECT THE INTERNET APPLE SYSTEM TO THE VARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS THAT MANY OF THESE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE. SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'VE NOT PLACED OVERSIGHT AND THERE ONE PARTICULAR ENTITY. FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE S. B. EIGHT TWO TWO AND HER QUESTION ABOUT. THANK YOU MY CHEN NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS US STEEP CARLSON PROCEED HE AYE A WHERE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. MIKE MY COLLEAGUES I THINK HIT ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE BILL I'D LIKE TO KIND OF MAYBE GIVE US SOME SORT OF A BROADER VIEW UP. THERE IS A REAL FALLACY AT THE HEART OF A I THINK THAT. WHAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER? ONE SIDE SWORD OWNS THE NET NEUTRALITY -- BELOW TO FIGHT THESE BUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. WE STATED EARLIER THAT THERE IS NO NET NEUTRALITY. THERE IS IN FACT ROBUST NET NEUTRALITY EXISTS EVERYDAY. FROM EVERY COMPANY [inaudible] WHAT YOU HEAR THE WITNESSES HERE SAY AS WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE RULES? THAT WE WANT -- TO SUGGEST THAT -- WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK REMOVE NET NEUTRALITY? AND THAT THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF OF OF BUT SENATOR WINNERS BILL WAS IN FACT THE TWENTY FIFTEEN RULES. IF DISAGREED BY. CHICO ENTERPRISE RECORD TECH CRIME SCENE THAT WIRED ALL THE ARTICLES THAT CAME OUT AFTER THE HEARING THE OTHER DAY. LAST WEEK SAID WELL. THOSE RULES ONE WAY BY. BUT WOULD IT WOULD IN FACT THE COMMITTEE DID WAS PUT IN THE CORD NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES. THAT'S WHAT'S IN THIS BILL RIGHT NOW IT'S GOT A FEW OTHER THINGS TO WHICH WE DISAGREE WITH. BUT TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER NET NEUTRALITY IS GONE DOESN'T EXIST. WE WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THAT. WE ALSO THINK THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT MIGHT BE WHAT COULD BE WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. IT REALLY HASN'T HAPPENED. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS TO TRY TO SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PUT? IN PLACE AND YOU HEARD ALL THE ALL THE SUPPORTERS SAY THIS GO BACK. TO A SET OF RULES THAT ARE UNNECESSARY PRESCRIPTIVE AND WILL HAVE NEGATIVE CONSUMER IMPACTS. WE WOULD THE U. DECISIVE THE LAST HEARING I THINK WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW. A ALARMIST SPECULATION. GET IN THE WAY OF DE A RADICAL DEPARTURE. FROM THE LIGHT REGULATORY TOUCH WHICH HAS ALLOWED THE INTERNET TO BECOME WHAT IT IS TODAY. PARTICULARLY FROM CALIFORNIA AND I THINK WE AS CALIFORNIA. OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE -- SIXTEEN HAVE TO SAY. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS IN THE STATE THAT MADE ALL THIS HAPPEN? WE WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THEM A NO VOTE.

WHERE TOP ON BEHALF OF ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING AND LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS I MR OBERNOLTE HAD A QUESTION. FIRST. FOLLOWED BY MISTER NOLAN BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I TO QUESTION. ABOUT THE COMMITTEE ACTION FROM A WEEK AGO AND I KNOW THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE COMMITTEE INTENDED. TO HAVE THE BILL IMPLEMENT EXACTLY THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTY A TWO THOUSAND TEN FCC ORDER. AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT SO I NOTICE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT ONE OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. JUST DELETE THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL AND REFERENCES THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT THAT YOU WERE HOLDING UP. THAT'S A VERY VIVID IMAGE. YOU KNOW THE DATA AND SO THE BILL UNDER THAT AMENDMENT WOULD JUST REFERENCE THAT DOCUMENT AND AND REQUIRE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH IN CALIFORNIA. TO ADHERE TO THOSE REQUIREMENTS I ARE YOU ACCEPTING THAT AMENDMENT ON HER ARE RESPECTFULLY NO AND WE PERSON OUGHT. WE AGREE WE'VE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND WE ARE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE THAT THE COMMITTEE AND IT'S VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS WAS. TRYING TO THINK FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK AND WE WE APPRECIATE THAT. ON THE CHALLENGE WITH DOING IT YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST SAW IT IS VERY TEMPTING TO SAY YEAH OF COURSE HE WOULD DO THAT. IS ARE THERE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT -- CHALLENGING WITH PASSING A STATE LAW TO SAY YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH A REPEALED. FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO SOMETHING AS CRAFTING IT AND I KNOW THAT THE STAFF I'M SO HAD. IT'S NOT BEEN A JAILBREAK FROM LAST WEEK HOLLYWOOD WORK. GUESSING MAY HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH US TO DO THAT -- BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO TO TO GET OUT IT. TO SOME A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING ABOUT. ALSO THE WITH THE ORDER -- THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF IT THAT ARE NOT NET NEUTRALITY -- AND SO IT WOULD BE ACQUIRING COMPLIANCE WITH THEM THINGS THAT NO ONE ON ANY SITE IS. IS ASKING -- FOR AND IN ADDITION UP PARTS OF THIS ORDER ARE ON RESPONDING TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE'S A LOT OF TO SORT OF COLLOQUY THING THERE WAS THIS COMMENT THIS IS OUR RESPONSE. SO IT JUST DOESN'T MATCH UP IN THE WAY THAT YOU WANT TO AND THAT'S WHY. ARE WE SPENT OUR SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY -- MY STAFF OUTSIDE FOLKS ARE TAKING WHAT'S IN THIS ORDER THAT IS ACTUALLY LEGAL OBLIGATION AROUND THE NEUTRALITY. AND PUTTING IT INTO A BILL WITHOUT BEST APPROACH SO -- SO GO WERE APPRECIATIVE OF THE CREATIVE THINKING ABOUT WHERE WERE UNABLE TO ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT OKAY WELL I JUST THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A KIND OF A CREATIVE WAY OF SOLVING THE DILEMMA WAS CREATIVE ELEGANCE. BUT I'M WERE PURCHASED IT DOESN'T MATCH UP. IT'S PERFECTLY AS WE WOULD LIKE SO OKAY WELL I MEAN I I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY BUT I WANTED TO TAKE. A MINUTE AND TELL YOU WHY AND WHAT I TALKED TO CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE IT'S ALWAYS A DIFFICULT DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INTERNET NEUTRALITY YOU TALK ABOUT AN OPEN AND FREE INTERNET IN A LACK OF DISCRIMINATION. THESE WORDS ARE VERY EMOTIONALLY EVOCATIVE. AND IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO SAY WELL HOW COULD YOU NOT SUPPORT THAT. BUT I LIKE TO USE THAT ANALOGY AND A FEW FOR ABUSE IT BEFORE I APOLOGIZE BUT I I TELL PEOPLE THAT THE INTERNET'S KINDA LIKE VILLAGE BY A RIVER. AND THE VILLAGERS CAN SEE ACROSS THE RIVER THIS HIGHWAY BUT THEY CAN'T GET TO IT IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING AND ONE DAY A BRIDGE COMPANY DECIDES TO BUILD A BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER THAT IS OF GREAT BENEFIT TO EVERYONE THAT LIVES IN THE VILLAGE. SO MORE AND MORE PEOPLE USE THIS BRIDGE EVERYDAY AND THE BRIDGE IS ONLY DESIGNED TO HOLD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AT ONCE. SO THE BRIDGE COMPANIES GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO THEY LIMIT THE TRAFFIC TO THE BRIDGE. AND SO TO COME UP WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CHARGE A DIFFERENT TOLL FOR EIGHTEEN WHEELERS ON HONDA CIVICS EIGHTEEN WHEELERS PAY MORE BECAUSE THEY WAY MORE. AND THEY ALSO MAY BE THAT THAT'S A PAID PART OF OUR THAT'S DIFFERENTIAL PRICING. RIGHT THE IN THE ANALOGY I'M ALSO GOING TO ADD A TOLL ROAD PETROLEUM TO THE BRIDGE THAT. PEOPLE CAN PAY TO GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE WITH LESS TRAFFIC WHICH BY THE WAY AS A BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY BECAUSE IT MOVES TRAFFIC. I OUT OF THE DANTE BLAMES THAT'S PRIORITIZATION. THE QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR OR DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU OPPOSE THAT THEN YOU'RE A FAN OF BRIDGE NEUTRALITY. AND IF YOU THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO CHARGE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEHICLES THEY ON YOUR OPPONENT A BRIDGE NEUTRALITY. AND I THINK THAT REALLY BRINGS IT HOME TO PEOPLE. IN WHAT WHAT WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE THAT AND I KNOW THAT. SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL WE KNOW WHAT WHAT HAPPENS BRIDGE COMPANY HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF IMPACT. OVER WHAT KIND OF VEHICLES TRANSIT THE BRIDGE I IT'S NOT FAIR THEY THEY COULD TOTALLY PREVENT CERTAIN TYPES OF VEHICLES FROM CROSSING THE BRIDGE. YOU KNOW AS AT A FAIR THING EVEN ON THE BRIDGE COMPANY HASN'T TALKED ABOUT DOING THAT. AND THE SOLUTION TO THAT. IS TO BUILD MORE BRIDGES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT IS WE WANT LOTS OF BRIDGES WE WANT LOTS OF INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS PROVIDING DATA TO PEOPLE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND THE MORE. REGULATION THAT WE LYER ON TOP OF THE ACT OF PROVIDING THAT SERVICE TO PEOPLE THE FEWER BRIDGES WE GET. AND NOT THE MORE BRIDGES WE GET. AND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WE WOULD DON'T WANT ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR ON THE INTERNET. AND I THINK THAT WE WILL ALL BE UNANIMOUS IN OUR OPINION ON THAT. HOWEVER WE DO ALREADY HAVE RULES IN PLACE. THAT PROHIBIT THAT TYPES OF BEHAVIOR. WE HAVE RULES THAT ARE ANTI TRUST AND FORCED THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAVE RULES AGAINST ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR THAT WERE FORCED BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND I WOULD SAY THAT ANY. INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER THAT HAD THE TEMERITY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE PROHIBITING SOMEONE FOR VISITING A WEBSITE. WOULD INSTANTLY BE FACED WITH A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER FROM ONE OF THOSE AGENCIES IF NOT MULTIPLE AGENCIES. AND THERE'S A TRACK RECORD OF THIS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED ABUSES IN THE PAST. I MOST OF THOSE HAVE COME TO LIGHT. BECAUSE THE FCC TOOK ACTION AGAINST THOSE COMPANIES BY THE WAY A LOT OF THE ONES THAT WE WERE TAUGHT THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PRESENTATION. ARE OCCURRED BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND TEN FCC NET NEUTRALITY ORDER SO THE FCC WAS ALREADY ON THE JOB AND ALREADY WAS PROHIBITING THOSE KINDS OF BEHAVIOR. ARE YOU KNOW THE REAL PROBLEM THAT I HAVE THAT NEUTRALITY IS THIS EVERY TIME THAT WE TRY TO MAKE IT. LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE EIGHTEEN WHEELERS ACROSS THE BRIDGE. BY DEFINITION WE'RE MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE PEOPLE AT HONDA CIVICS ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND MOST OF US DRIVE HONDA CIVICS. SO. THE BREAK THE THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THEY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FIXED COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN PROVIDING THE SERVICE THAT THEY DO. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECOVER THOSE COSTS OR GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND IF WE PROHIBIT THEM FROM CHARGING CERTAIN TRAFFIC MORE. AND PRIORITIZING CERTAIN TRAFFIC DOWN ALL THE TRAFFIC IS GOING TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE SO AFTER RESPECTFULLY OF OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY BUT I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD IT'S A IT'S A GOOD DISCUSSION HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT'S A FASCINATING -- AN ALLERGY A MISTER MOLEN HASN'T. I WISH I HAD A COOL COUNTER ANALOGY. BUT I CAN HE DOES GOOD HE DOES GET BETTER EVERY TIME -- LET ME JUST SIMPLY SAY SENATOR WINNER THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS ISSUE HEAD ON YOU LIKE TO GET INTO THESE DIFFICULT STICKY ISSUES AND I APPLAUD YOUR FORKS AND NO IT'S NOT. A EASY TO DO SOME A PROUD PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL. S. B. EIGHT TWO TO THE PRE AMENDED VERSION I DO BELIEVE THAT AMENDMENTS WEEK IN THE CORPS. A CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS HOW THAT ALL. OCCURRED SO ACCORDINGLY ALTHOUGH THE BILL FORWARD TODAY TO CONVERSATION MOVING. HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME UP WITH A PRODUCT WHERE THE INTERESTS OF THE CONSUMERS ARE PARAMOUNT. AND THAT WE SET A UP STANDARD FOR NET NEUTRALITY FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY -- TO FOLLOW SO I WILL VOTE ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE TIME COMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER ALCOTT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. YOU KNOW WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE THEIR ACTION AND WITH REGARD TO NET NEUTRALITY IN THE REPEAL OF IT -- MYSELF COLLEAGUES IN THIS HOUSE AND ALSO COLLEAGUES IN THE OTHER HOUSE. WE ARE VERY CLEAR THAT WE WANTED TO RESTORE THOSE PROTECTIONS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE. THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOKING OUT FOR US IN MAINTAINING WHAT WE'VE HAD. THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE TO ACT TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO RE IMPLEMENT THE OBAMA. TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER OR WE ARE GOING TO NOT DO NOTHING -- YOURSELF AND SENATOR DELEON TOOK THE MANTLE TO DO THAT -- AND I THINK THAT IT'S BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION HAVE -- WITH REGARDS TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT IN THE PROCESS I THINK WAS BECOME. DIFFICULT -- FOR MYSELF BUT I THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS IS IS JUST -- THERE'S AND THERE'S NO CLEAR THERE'S NEVER BEEN A CLEAR EXPLANATION AS TO WHERE THESE GOAL POSTS REALLY ARE -- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE A BOMB ORDER YOUR BILL AND THEN ALSO YOUR ORIGINAL VERSION OF YOUR BILL IN THE AMENDED VERSION OF YOUR BILL. AND AND AND YOU KNOW YOU TALK YOU KNOW NEAR PROPONENTS SAY WOW THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS WITH THE OBAMA ORDER WAS TO TALK TO THE OPPONENTS OF ON AND SAY IT IS COMPLETELY. DIFFERENT IT GOES FAR BEYOND WHAT THE ORIGINAL BOND ORDER DID. AND IN ALL THREE HUNDRED PAGES YOU HAVE RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PAGES OF COMMENT. AND ABOUT TWENTY PAGES OF OTHER MORE SUBSTANTIVE SCENARIO -- TYPE OF INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW. BUT I ASKED MY STAFF TO DO AS I SAID OKAY YOU KNOW IT TAKE WHATEVER THE MAIN PROVISIONS ARE OF THE ORIGINAL TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. PUT ON PUT IT DOWN AND THEN LATER ON WHAT YOU KNOW S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TO DOAND WHAT DOES HE DO NOW AS ADAM OUT AS IT'S AMENDED. NEITHER THE WHAT WE PUT TOGETHER WAS. IN OTHER FIRST ISSUE WHICH IS THE REQUEST OCCASION OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE DOZEN APPLIED IN APPLYING YOUR BILL THERE'S A PLAN THAT -- BLOCKING. WAS ORIGINALLY IN YOUR BILL UNDER THE AMENDED VERSION TO US IT LOOKS THIS IT WOULD BE IF THE SAME AND YOUR BILL TODAY THROTTLING. WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN YOUR BILL LOOKS TO BE THE SAME AS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS IN IN YOUR BILL TODAY? PAID PRIORITIZATION AND YOUR BILL IT PROHIBITED THIRD PARTY PAID PRIORITIZATION. HOWEVER IN THE NOW AMENDED VERSION IT REMOVES THE THIRD PARTY I'M A STILL BUT STILL PROHIBITS PAID PRIORITIZATION. AND THEN THEIR STANDARD FOR INTERNET CONDUCT. AND WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN YOUR BILL -- AT LEAST FROM OUR ASSESSMENT LOOKS TO BE THE SAME AS IT IS IN YOUR BILL AND THEN THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS JUST BEING. YOUR ORIGINAL BILL THIS BEING THE AMENDED VERSION. I THAT SEEM TO GO BEYOND WHATEVER THE A BOMB ORDER HAD DONE -- AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW I I I I I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE COMMITTEES ORIGINAL. APROPOS PROPOSAL TO JUST REFERENCE YEARS FIFTH TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER I UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES WITH DOING THAT ESPECIALLY BEING A LAW THAT NO LONGER. EXISTS -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT RESPECT THAT BUT I THINK WHAT A LOT OF MEMBERS YOU'RE GONNA FACE MOVING FORWARD. IS IS THAT. A I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO UNDO THE ACTIONS OF PREVIOUS POLICY COMMITTEE. I REGARDLESS OF HOW THOSE CHANGES HAPPEN. I BUT I THINK MOVING FOR THE CONCERN IT'S GONNA BE IS WHAT DID WHAT WAS THE INTENT AND THE HEART OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN A BOMB ORDER. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AT LEAST CODIFYING INTO LAW OF THOSE SAME [inaudible] PROVISIONS NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS -- AND THERE BEEN A DISAGREEMENTS THERE HAVE BEEN THINGS THAT WERE PROPOSED FOR THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER THAT. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TRIED DECIDED TO TAKE PASS ON SOME OF ARGUED THAT THOSE WERE ORIGINAL IN YOUR ORIGINAL VERSION OF YOUR BILL OTHERS. NOW THE PROPONENTS SAY AREN'T -- BUT I THINK. MOVING FORWARD BUT IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY VITAL IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND. THAT WHATEVER WE MOVE UPON AND WHATEVER WE TAKE ACTION ON IS. IT LEAST AND ITS FORM ACT CURRENT FORM REGARDLESS OF HOW WE SEE IT IS A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT THE OBAMA ORDER WAS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- FOR MYSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS CONTINUE SUPPORT -- BAN. WHAT I WILL SAY THAT WAS YOU KNOW FOR THOSE THAT REPRESENT THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL? YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THIS POSITION AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT OF I DON'T WANT A PATCHWORK. OF DIFFERENT STATES PASSING DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO BE COMPLYING WITH AND HOW THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERNET AS A PROVIDER. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT I I GET THAT BUT WHAT DID YOU DO TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. WHEN IT WAS ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT DID YOU DO? DID YOU ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE RE CLASSIFICATION AND WHO YOU WERE. WHO YOU WERE BEING REGULATED BY? OR DID YOU FIGHT TO STOP AND PREVENT IT FROM EVER HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU SHOULD HAVE. BECAUSE IF THAT HAD NEVER BEEN REPEALED WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE POSITION THAT WE ARE TODAY WHERE WE AS A STATE. NOW HAVE TO ACT ON WHAT YOU CLASSIFY A FEDERALLY PRINT ISSUE -- WE VERY MUCH AS A FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD SHOULD HAVE A SAY IN WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE INTERNET. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE DO DOESN'T SERVE JUST AS A NATIONAL MODEL SERVES AS AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL SO WE VERY MUCH TAKE THE COMPLETE MCKAY IMPLEMENTATION THAT. THE THE THE THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT WE DO EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY. BUT IN THE FUTURE I THINK WHAT FRUSTRATES MYSELF IN MY OTHER COLLEAGUES IS THAT. THINGS WILL HAPPEN ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WILL TRY TO RESTORE THAT BECAUSE WE APPRECIATE THEM THE PROTECTIONS AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT YET. WHAT WAS DONE ON YOUR AND? TO KEEP US FROM EVER GETTING TO THIS POINT. TRUMP'S FIGHTING AGAINST THE AS A PROVIDER FROM SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THE WE NEED TO KEEP THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THIS IS WHAT WORKS AND IT'S GONNA CAUSE A HEADACHE FOR US BECAUSE EVERY STATES WANT TO IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN POLICY. I THINK THAT THAT -- YOU CAN GO BACK -- BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE IT PUTS US ALL IN A POSITION WHERE NOW TRYING TO RE LITIGATE AN ISSUE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED. IT WAS ALREADY SETTLED ON THE FOUNDED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE OUR CONSTITUENTS WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY DESERVE AND THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS NO. NOBODY THAT HAS ANY ADVANTAGE OVER ANOTHER I MEAN. SO I THINK THAT ON THE PROPONENT SIDE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. AS TRUE TO THAT A BOMB ORDER AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE WE GET SOMETHING TO THE GOVERNOR. BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION HOUSE I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL TODAY THOUGH IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MISS VARIAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BEFORE I IT GIVE MY COMMENTS I DID WANT TO SAY THAT FOR THIS VILLAGE AND THE FREEWAY IN THE BRIDGE. IF THE VILLAGE AND THE RIVER AND THE BRIDGE BELONG TO THE PEOPLE THAN A BELONGS TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR ME. THAT WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT IT DOES BELONG TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE. THERE WERE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE DO NEED A NET NEUTRALITY BILL THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. OF BETWEEN YOU AND A SENATOR KEVIN DE LEóN THERE WAS THE DISCUSSION AND YOURS IS THE ONE THAT CAME FORWARD -- WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE I I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT CAN'T BE UNDONE -- BUT THERE HAS TO BE DISCUSSION. WE NEED A NET NEUTRALITY BILL AND WE NEED THE STAKEHOLDERS TO BE AT THE TABLE TOGETHER TO DISCUSS WHAT IS BEST SO THAT AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS SAID SOMETHING IS PASSED AND TAKEN TO THE GOVERNOR. WE CANNOT BE WITHOUT. NECRO TOOK NEUTRALITY SO I I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT IT FORWARD APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THAT EVERYBODY DO JOIN. TOGETHER SO THAT WE DO GIVE SOMETHING TO THE GOVERNOR THE IT TAKES ALL PEOPLE ALL OWNERS OF THAT BRIDGE THAT. THAT VILLAGE AND THAT FREEWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IT'S KIND. I HAVE A DIFFERENT SENATOR I'D. JUST BE CLEAR IF THE OBAMA ERA -- RULE OR ORDER HAD NOT BEEN THE BILL WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN NECESSARY. I WOULD I WOULD HAVE -- I'M I'M WHEN I'M WE MOVE FORWARD THIS BILL. BECAUSE I DON'T ACTUALITY PROTECTIONS WERE REPEALED GOT GAS AND SO THERE IS THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD SAID WELL LET'S JUST REFERENCE -- THAT ORDER -- SO. UNDER THAT WOULD WIN THAT THAT ORDER WAS STILL IN PLACE -- HOW IS A COMPANY OR AN ISP TO GO ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT ITS OBLIGATIONS WERE? WELL OF COURSE THE FCC WITH THE REGULATOR AND AND SPEAKING OF WHETHER WE'RE GOING UP TO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER BEYOND ONE THING WE DID NOT DO. IN THIS BILL IS RECLASSIFY EYES PEAS AS PUBLIC UTILITIES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID THAT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS TO BE HEEDED. THE MOST OF EVERYTHING WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE SO IN THAT RESPECT WE YOU KNOW IT IT DOESN'T EVEN TALK TO ANNOUNCE A NO ONE HAS BEEN ASKING. US FOR THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE IF YOU SEE OUGHT TO BE IN CHARGE AND THAT'S ITS OWN SEPARATE A DYNAMIC -- SO -- HIGH BUT THE F. C. C. OF COURSE WOULD BE THE QUOTE WAS THE GLOBAL UTILITY STYLE. OUR REGULATOR AND IT BECOMES. INNOVATIVE BAY THAT ARE AT THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW THE REGULATION OVERSIGHT. OCCURRED SO SO EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD. TO AYE STAY FAITHFUL TO TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. PUTTING ASIDE THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND ECONOMY NOT A NOT ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE EXACTLY PERFECTLY LINE FOR LINE. OF WITH THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER BUT WE DID WORK. NOR A COMMENT ON THAT. WHEN I CLOSE ABOUT HOW WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT -- pTHE SAME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THE FCC IN THE FCC REGULATES IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN WE DO OF LEGISLATIVE LIKE -- SO WE I AM AGAIN WITH THAT PERSON THEN WE APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF IT WE JUST DON'T THINK IT WORKS LOGISTICALLY. ITEMS PASS HERE ARE A STATE LEVEL BILL THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED. SO EVEN IF IT WASN'T ENTIRELY WORKABLE DO YOU THINK THAT IF THAT AMENDMENT WERE ADOPTED AT THAT POINT IT WOULD BE A REAL NET NEUTRALITY BELLER WOULD STILL BE AN END OF TRIAL AND BILLING NAME ONLY. I I I I I THINK IF WE HAVE A BILL THAT. THAT DOES EVERYTHING THAT TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. DID AND YES THAT WOULD BE A STRONG NET NEUTRALITY BILL. WHAT CAME OUT OF COMMITTEE LAST WEEK DOES NOT MEET THAT? A STANDARD WHAT WE PROPOSED I DID IDEALLY THE FCC WERE REALIZED EMITTER WILL MISTAKEN REINSTATE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AND THAT THEY WILL BE. MUCH MORE PEACE AND HARMONY ON EARTH. WE CAN ALL HOPE FOR THAT -- THE PEACE AND HARMONY PART -- SO I I DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. THE POINTS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION THEY MOLESTED OFF A FEW THINGS LIKE A ZERO RATING IN OUR CONNECTIONS -- PROCUREMENT AND I THINK THAT THOSE ITEMS I GO BEYOND WHAT THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ORDERED AND SO I KNOW I DO I DO SO IN TERMS OF INTERCONNECTION. ARE AND THEY AND THERE WAS -- CHERRY PICKING UP SOME LANGUAGE IN THAT ORDER I'VE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. ABSOLUTELY AND EXPLICITLY AND WE CAN PROVIDE THE LANGUAGE OUGHT PROVIDED THAT YOU CAN NOT GIVE BE NET NEUTRALITY AT THE POINT OF INTERCONNECTION. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THE AMOUNT FROM LAST WEEK THAT SAYING NO YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THE MAMMOTH LESLIE SAID NO BLOCKING THROTTLING. NOTES THAT ARE THAT IS LISTED IN THEIR BUT IT IT IS NOT BE THE COMMITTEE REMOVED. THE PROVISION IN OUR BILL THAT WAS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER THAT YOU CAN'T USE IN OUR CONNECTION TO AVOID MENTALITY IN WHAT IS I MEAN. YEAH IF I'M AN ISP AND YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN'T BLOCK ANYONE ON YOUR OWN NETWORK. BUT YOU CAN DO AT THE POINT WHERE DATA FLOWS INTO YOUR NETWORK WHICH IS CALLED INTERCONNECTION. THEN UNDER CHARLIE DOESN'T EXIST SO GREAT I WON'T BLOCK ANYONE ON MY NETWORK I'M JUST GONNA SHUT THEM DOWN AS THEY ENTER MY NETWORKS OF YOUR TIMES ISN'T PAYING ME. ENOUGH MONEY OUGHT NEAR TIMES DATA DOESN'T GET TO ENTER MY NETWORK OR IT'S GOING TO ENTER INTO REALLY DEGRADED WAY. THEY DID THAT TO NETFLIX -- DOT WAS THAT SO THE INFAMOUS HOME WHERE WE'RE NOT POLLUTE THEY WANT TO CHARGE THAT SAY IT HATE NETFLIX IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS MY CUSTOMERS. YOU PAY ME A FEE. AND WHEN THAT LOOKS WHEN DO IT I'D BE DEGRADED. NETFLIX AND THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS VERY IT WAS A LOT OF BUFFERING GOING ALONG WITH NETFLIX ULTIMATELY NETFLIX. PAID. IT'S OUR TRADE SECRETS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT. THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY -- NETFLIX CAN AFFORD TO PAY IT. AND THE DATA. ARE THERE A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THAT AND THAT'S WHAT'S SCARY ABOUT SO THE INTERCONNECTION PIECE WAS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER -- IT WAS TAKEN OUT LAST WEEK OF OUR BILL YOU COMMITTEE ZERO RATING -- VIA AND WE HAVE A LETTER FROM TOM WHEELER FROM CHAIRMAN WHEELER ATTESTING TO THAT. I ZERO RATING -- Y. DAXI SEE UNDER THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. UNDER THE GENERAL CONDUCT WILL WAS BEGINNING TO ENFORCE ON AGAINST I BELIEVE IT WAS A TNT. ON ZERO RATING BECAUSE IF YOU ARE IF YOU TEAR COMCAST. RISE AND SANDRA -- ANDY AND SAID HEY IF USE MY PRODUCT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY -- USER DATA IF YOU DATA. AND EVEN THOUGH THAT SOLD AS QUOTE UNQUOTE FREE DATA IT'S NOT VERY. AYE WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES THE EYEPIECE AND SENATE TO KEEP YOUR DATA COPS LOW. AND TO MAKE UNLIMITED DATA PLANS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IF EVERYONE CAN AFFORD UNLIMITED DATA PLAN ZERO RATING HAS NO VALUE SO PEOPLE -- WHO IF WARY OF LIKE I'VE I KNOW. WE'RE ABLE TO MOST OF US PLAY FOR AN UNLIMITED DATA PLAN. WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON ZERO RATINGS TELL US WHERE TO GO WE GET THE PICKET. IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME CONSUMER. I AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD UNLIMITED A PLAN THEN YOU GET BASICALLY DROPPED INTO HERE THE FIVE OPS. THAT YOU CAN USE AND WON'T COUNT AGAINST YOUR DATA. OUR AND SO WHAT'S YOUR RATING DOES IT TURNS - IT TURNS THE INTERNET INTO A FORM OF CABLE. ARMY CABLE CUSTOMER I LIKE CABLE NO OFFENSE CAROLINE THOUGHT. BUT I DON'T WANT MY INTERNET TO BE CABLE WHERE I'M TOLD HERE THAT FIFTY PLACES YOU CAN GO -- AND NO ONE ELSE HAS A CONTRACT WITH US AND SO YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE. BY AND SO ZERO RATING IS -- IT WHEN IT'S DONE ABUSIVE WAY. CAN BE VERY ANTI CONSUMER I'M NOT. IN ORDER WAS HAD INITIATED AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST A TNT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SHOT THAT ENFORCEMENT DOWN. I DO WANT TO GIVE -- THE WHAT IT'S MAKING TO YOU CHANCE TO RESPOND BECAUSE OUR FATHERS AND PRETTY CLEAR LANGUAGE ON THE INTERCONNECTION THAT YOU LET US FOR THE ORDER. ABSOLUTELY WE'VE GOT. MISTER A KILEY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH US SENATOR WIENERS A POINT OF VIEW ON THIS. FIRST AND FOREMOST I READ MY TESTIMONY AND I QUOTE DISORDER DOES NOT APPLY THE OPEN INTERNET RULES TO INNER CONNECTION UNQUOTE THAT WAS IN BLACK AND WHITE IN THE FCC ORDER. AND SO THERE WAS NO PROHIBITION ON INNER CONNECTION. ON THE ISSUE OF ZERO RATING -- IN FACT THEY SPECIFICALLY AT THE FCC YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS ISSUE AND THEY DID NOT PROHIBIT ZERO RATING NOW THE SUGGESTION. THAT A TNT WAS UNDER SOME FORM OF INVESTIGATION. THE FCC MADE AN INQUIRY OF A. T. AND T. EIGHTEEN T. RESPONDED TO THAT INQUIRY AND IT WAS STAFF BACK AND FORTH A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH A. T. AND T.. THERE WAS NO STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO THE FCC THE FCC TOOK NO ACTION OR ENFORCEMENT AGAINST A TNT WE WERE NEVER FORMALLY CHARGED OR ACCUSED OF ANY VIOLATION. IN FACT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ONE ZERO RATING AND FREE DATA AT EIGHTEEN T. AND I SUSPECT IT'S TRUE OF ALL THE COMPETITORS WE HAVE AN OPEN ANTI DISCRIMINATION POLICY SO ANY CONTENT PROVIDER. GET NOW ZERO RATING WITH A TNT FOR THE IDENTICAL PRICES. WITH NO DATA CAPS WHATSOEVER. AND SO EVERYBODY WHETHER YOU'RE SMALL OR LARGE CAN ACCESS THE PLATFORM AND PROVIDE CONTENT. WITH A ZERO RATING PROGRAM THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS ZERO RATING IS BASICALLY A MARKETING PLAN WERE CONTACT A CONTENT COMPANY WOULD LIKE TO PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCT. TO AN ISP'S CUSTOMER AND THE CUSTOMER BENEFITS BY GETTING ZIP FREE DATA OUT OF THE DEAL IF AND ONLY IF. THEY CHOOSE TO SIGN UP FOR FOR ZERO RATING AND BY THE WAY. THE FALLACY OF THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION IS NO ONE IS BLOCK IF A CONTENT PROVIDER CHOOSES NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A ZERO RATING PROGRAM AND MANY DON'T. THEY HAVE UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM. UNLIMITED NO CONSUMERS EVER BLOCKED NO CONSUMERS EVER DENIED ACCESS. I WOULD SUGGEST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'LL MAKE THIS MY FINAL COMMENT RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION. THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE ON THE INTERNET. YOU'RE NEVER BLOCKS YOU GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT COLLECT ANY CONTENT YOU WANT AT ANY TIME YOU WANT THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S MASSIVE VIOLATIONS. IS INACCURATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND I ALSO ONE QUESTION FOR THE AWARENESS FROM US STANFORD THAT WERE YOU INVOLVED IN -- THE IN CRAFTING THE BOMB ERA ORDERED YOU TESTIFIED FOR THE FCC ANYWAY IN THAT. YES SO I DID TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THE FCC YES AND I WAS INVOLVED IN THE IN THAT PROCEEDING. AND WERE THERE ANY -- POLICIES THAT. OR THERE THAT DID MAKE IT INTO THAT ORDER BUT ARE PART OF THIS BILL LIKE OF THE ORIGINAL OR AMENDED VERSION. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- A LOT OF THE PROPOSALS THAT. ME AND I AND YOU KNOW I THEN AND NEUTRALITY PROPONENTS PUT FORWARD WERE EMBODIED IN THE ORDER THAT THEY WERE IN THIS BILL AND THEY WERE CUT LAST WEEK. SO I THINK THAT SO IF YOU NEED THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF IT -- ON ZERO RATING ABSENT OF WE NOT ICING BECAUSE TRY TO SAVE THE THE BILL PICKS UP WHERE THE OBAMA F.. LEFT OFF AND I JUST WANNA RESPOND TO THIS IDEA THAT YEAH LEGALISTIC WAY I MEAN THERE WAS THE ENFORCEMENT BUREAU WAS LOOKING AT WHAT YOU WERE DOING WAS SENDING LETTERS TO YOU. THOSE ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE NEVER FORMALLY BROUGHT TO AN END BECAUSE THEN THE FCC CHANGED WHAT DID HAPPEN WAS THAT THE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAU IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONE OF THE FINAL SAYINGS. THE OBAMA CC DID WAS PUBLISHER REPORT THAT WAS CALLED. POLICY REVIEW OF MOBILE BROADBAND OPERATORS SPONSORED DATA OFFERINGS FOR ZERO RATED CONTENT AND SERVICES AND SO THAT'S WHAT. SENATE HAVE WE NOT IS REFERRING. TO SO LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK FOR A SECOND AND TALK ABOUT WHAT HE HANDED OUT WHICH WAS. THIS QUESTION OF HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE THE ORDER INTO LAW. I WHEN YOU DON'T WANT THE REGULATORY AGENCY TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF STUFF. SO ONE OF THE BIG MARCHING ORDERS FOR THIS BILL WERE WE DO NOT WANT A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID LOOK GUYS I AM NOT A REGULATED. I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO LONG YEAR LONG PROCEEDINGS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ALL THESE THINGS MEAN. SO TO THE EXTENT PLEASE THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON THINGS LIKE SEWER RATING. I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE DOT. AND SO IN THAT SENSE. THE BILL IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT DOES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON ZERO RATING THAT IS MODELED AFTER WHAT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN OR THAT DID. ARM YOUR BY DOTS STUDIO -- I THINK OF IT I I I I THINK. WE HAVE TO BE MORE BRIGHT LINE IN SOME RESPECTS THAN THE FCC BECAUSE AND AGAIN IT WOULD BE EASIER IF WE JUST GAVE IT ALL AND CENTER DALY OWNS ORIGINAL BILL. A HIS ORIGINAL VERSION THAT DOES IT DOES SAID THAT THE CPC'S HAVE A PROCEEDING. AND YOU KNOW ADOPT ALL THESE RULES AND EVA UTILITIES SAU REGULATOR. NO ONE WANTED THAT ON EITHER SIDE THE PROPONENTS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING THE OPPONENTS EVER THAT WAS THE ONE AREA OF COMMON GROUND -- AND SO THAT WAS TAKEN OUT SO AS A RESULT -- WERE BECAUSE IT IS BEING -- AND THAT'S IT A CHOICE THAT'S PRETTY UNIVERSALLY EMBRACED IN THIS BUILDING AROUND THE CPUC. A LOT YOU HAVE TO BE -- MUCH CLEARER IN SOME RESPECTS THAN YOU WOULD IF YOU'RE JUST SAYING HEY CPUC YOU FIGURE IT OUT BUT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR. THE FCC WAS BEGINNING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AROUND ZERO RATING -- THE FCC TOM WHEELER CONFIRMS AYE CONFIRMS AND IN THE SECOND LETTER HE SAT. AND WITH RESPECT TO INTERCONNECTION IT YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT IN THE TEXT OF THE ORDER. THAT SAYS OUR ASSERTION OF AUTHORITY OVER INTERNET TRAFFIC EXCHANGE PRACTICES WHICH IS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING INTERCONNECTION. ADDRESSES THE QUESTION BY PROVIDING US WITH THE NECESSARY CASE BY CASE ENFORCEMENT TOLD TO IDENTIFY PRACTICES THAT MAY CONSTITUTE SUCH A VISION OF NET NEUTRALITY. AND ADDRESS THEM NOT BASICALLY INTERNET CONNECTION AGREEMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT IF THEY'RE USED TO EVADE NEUTRALITY PAY ME MONEY OR MY CUSTOMERS WON'T SEE YOUR WEBSITE RATHER GREATER TRAFFIC. AND ON LETTER FROM TOM WHEELER THAT ARE WE TO SCIENCE. DOTS Y. IN OUR TWENTY FIFTEEN OPEN INTERNET ORDER. THE FCC ASSERTED JURISDICTION OVER THE DEMANDS THAT BROADBAND COMPANIES CAN PUT INTO INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. IT WAS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER ABSOLUTELY -- AND AND SO IT WAS IN THERE WE HAVE -- WE'VE TAKEN SOME EXACT OUT OF THE ORDER IN TERMS OF OUR INTERNET CONNECTION -- LANGUAGES SO YOU CANNOT USE THE POINT OF OUR CONNECTION TO OBEY NET NEUTRALITY SO NOTHING EVER ALIGNS PERFECTLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING WITH THE FCC VERSUS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS ALWAYS GOOD. BUT WE WE HAVE REALLY TRIED. VERY HARD TO TRACK THE TO AND THERE ARE OTHER AREAS WE HAVE GOT INTO TODAY I DON'T WANT TO PROLONG THIS THAT WERE SLICED OUT LAST WEEK. WEEP AND ONE EXAMPLE GIVEN ARE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AND OUR BILL PROHIBITED CHARGING ACCESS FEES TO REACH CUSTOMERS SELF I'M. AYE NICE P. AND I SAY HEY YOUR WEBSITE IF YOU WANT MY CUSTOMERS SEE IT YOU HAVE TO PAY ME A FATE. THAT WAS BANNED BY TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER WAS BANNED IN A SPEED -- TWENTY TWO AND THE COMMITTEE LAST WEEK TOOK THAT OUT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS LIKE THAT. THANK YOU JUST DIED AT METRO GIVE THE WITNESS CHANCE TO FINISH OUT WHERE THERE ARE WE GONNA LIST ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE ZERO RATING WHERE YOU TESTIFIED FOR THEIR AND DIDN'T MAKE IT IN VOTES PART OF THE BILL HERE. YES SO THE THERE IS ONE ADDITION ALL -- SAYING WHICH IS THE USER PAID USER CONTROL QUALITY OF SERVICE. WHICH IS IN SECTION. SEVENTY SEVENTY SEVEN A AND THIS BILL WHAT THIS MEANS IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY. THE ICE FEES HAVE I ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN PROCEEDING WHEN THEY STILL THOUGHT. THE ODD -- THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ANY CHILD WHO RULES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WHAT THIS THAT SECTION OFF THE BILL DOES IS TO SAY LOOK. WHAT WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT IS WHO GETS TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF DATA AS POTENT A FOSS LANE AND TO GETS TO PAY? FOR WE DON'T WANT THE ICE PIECE TO DETERMINE WHO GETS PRIORITY ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THE INCENTIVES DON'T ALIGN WITH CUSTOMERS DOTS Y. WE PROHIBIT THE SLOWING DOWN OF APPLICATIONS AND CLASSES OF APPLICATIONS. AND WE ARE WORRIED THAT IF YOU CHARGE. HOW THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES FOR A FAST LANE? DODD WILL PUT EVERYBODY WHO KIND OF FOR TO PAY FOR THE FAST LANE SMALL BUSINESSES START UPS -- ACTIVISTS IN SPEAKERS WITHOUT THE POCKETS THAT WILL PUT THEM AS A DISADVANTAGE THAT'S WHY THE FCC ADOPTED THIS BAN ON POPPY TRADE HAS ASIAN [inaudible] BUT THOSE KINDS OF CONCERNS DON'T APPLY IF WE PUT CUSTOMERS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. SO IF AND I S. P. GIVES US. THE USERS OF THE INTERNET THE ABILITY TO SAY PAPER. TODAY I'M HAVING A SKY CHO WAS MY FRIEND I DON'T CARE AS MUCH OF IT IF SO IF. I HAVE DROPPED CALLS SO I JUST USE THE NORMAL SERVICE BUT IF I'M DOING A JOB INTERVIEW ON SKYPE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE NO DELAYS SO THAT THE CALL DOESN'T OFFER AND SO ON SO. SINCE. TWENTY TEN BOTH MY NEUTRALITY OPPONENTS AND NET NEUTRALITY OPPONENTS HAVE AGREED. DODD ANOTHER THREE CONDITIONS LINED OUT IN THE BILL THESE FORMS OFF WE QUALITY OF CONTROL GIUSEPPE QUALITY OF SERVICE SHOULD BE ALLOWED THE TWENTY TEN OF CC ALLOW THESE KINDS OF SERVICES. I HAD AUGUST ALONG WITH OTHERS THE SEC TO CLARIFY THAT RATHER THAN KEEPING THESE ON OF THOSE GENERAL CONDUCT OR THEY SHOULD CLARIFY. THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED. THEY DID NOT GET TO THAT. AND SO GIVEN THE ODDS SO IF THERE SEEMS TO BE UNIFORM AGREEMENT THAT THESE ARE. PRO CON SUMA OFFERING STUD ALLOWS HIGHEST HE'S TO DIFFERENTIATE THIS SERVICE AND INNOVATE AND SO OF TWO NEW COOL STUFF. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A NICE THING TO PUT INTO THE BILL -- WE HAVE NEVER CLAIMED THAT I WAS PART OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT ENDED WAS NOT. BUT IT WAS MEANT AS CLARIFYING SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY AGREES IS NOT HARMFUL. AND I PERSONALLY DO THINK I DO BELIEVE UNCERTAINTY AND I DO THINK IF WE CAN. CHAU ICE PIECE OF THAT THERE ARE THESE PRO CONSUMER WAYS OF DIFFERENTIATING THEIR SERVICES AND INNOVATING AND MAKING MONEY YOU KNOW CHARGING US FOR THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES NOW TO GET THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NINE LET ME -- LET ME ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR BRINGING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD. ARE A LOT HAS BEEN SAID IN THE LAST WEEK ABOUT THIS BILL. AND WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO HERE FROM MANY STAKEHOLDERS -- AND CONSTITUENTS IN FACT WE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS HAVE. A BULLFIGHT INDIA CAPITOL OFFICE AS WELL AS THE DID AS WELL AS THE DISTRICT OFFICE. AND FACT A NUMBER OF THEM ARE REQUESTED. THAT WE ARE THE COMMITTEE THAT IS SO TRY TO UNDO SOME OF THE ACTIONS OF THE LAST COMMITTEE. I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO BASICALLY. SHARE MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS ALL THESE RICH. OF THESE CONSTITUENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS. I AM I THINK THAT FOR THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO WORK PROPERLY COMMITTEES NEED. TO OUR LOW FOR ALL AND INTENDED CONSEQUENCES. A GIVEN THE STAKEHOLDERS HEAVY AND PERSONAL STAKES IN ANY GIVEN ISSUE. NOW THE PROCESS DOESN'T WORK IF WE DON'T ALLOW FOR THE INPUT. ARE THAT THE INSTITUTION IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE. IT MOST CERTAINLY DOES NOT WORK IF THE EXPECTATION IS THAT AMENDMENTS OF ONE COMMUNITY. ARE CAN BE WHOLLY UNDONE IN THE NEXT. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY -- THE AUTHOR HAS NOT THEIR ASKS DIED WE DO THAT TO TODAY. ARM AS COMMITTEES HOWEVER WE SHOULD BE EXPLORING THE VARIOUS OPTIONS ARE FORWARD. WHILE RESPECTING THE COMMITTEE PROCESS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY SUGGESTED A POSSIBLE POSSIBLE PATH FORWARD. AYE INDIANAPOLIS'S WE AUTHORED THE CONSIDER. ON IF HE CHOOSES TO IN THE FUTURE. IT IS ALSO MY BELIEVE THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ACCOMPLISH OF BOTH WHAT THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH YA AND ALSO WHAT THE PROPONENTS HAVE ASKED. NAMELY TO ADHERE TO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN FCC ORDER. OUR TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT. OF BUT IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE LAST COMMITTEE. AND THE DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT GO FURTHER THAN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS -- HIS THAT THEY TENDER REMOVE THE NEED. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO SYNTHESIZE A LARGE REGULATORY DOCUMENT THAT IS HOLY REFLECTIVE. OF THE FCC SELL FOR ACTION. HI PERSONALLY LEARNED HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS AND SEEN HOW MUCH STAKEHOLDERS MAY DISAGREE AS WE HAVE SEEN HERE TODAY. AS TO WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FCC ORDER. ARM WHEN I ENGAGE IN A SIMILAR AND HARD FIGHT THAT BATTLE TO PROTECT PRIVACY RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS. A WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND SOLD BY BUSINESSES. A PROTECTIONS WHICH WERE SIMILARLY ROLLBACK -- BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST LAST YEAR. NOW THAT BEING SAID I'VE -- I'M NOT ASKING THE AUTHOR TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS. OUR AS A COMEDIAN MEN MEN. BECAUSE YET THOUGH I THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COPYING. ALL THREE HUNDRED PLUS PAGES OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. AREN'T WORTH FORWARD TO INTO CALIFORNIA LAW. OUR WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE CPUC AS WE HEARD EARLIER. AND ALSO RE CLASSIFICATION. AND THE SIMPLE REFERENCE SO CROSS REFERENCE TO THE LAW AND TELLING EYES PEAS. OUR IN CALIFORNIA TO COMPLY WITHOUT LAW [inaudible] ARE. S. WE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR EARLY TODAY ARE HE IS WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD. OUR IN COMMITTEE WITH THE BILL AND PRINT -- BUT WISHES TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE THE CHAIR OF THE PRIOR COMMITTEE. HOW TO ENSURE FROM THE AUTHOR'S PERSPECTIVE BUT THE TO THE BILL IS AS STRONG AS THEIRS TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER? I UNDERSTAND FULLY THAT DESIRE AND I ASK THAT THE THE ALL. INCLUDE THIS COMMITTEE. AS WE GO FORWARD. SAID THAT WE COULD -- MAKE ALL CONTRIBUTIONS OUT TO THE EXTENT WE CAN. SO I WOULD THAT SET UP I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU. TO A CLOSE OUR ALLIES THERE ARE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEES. AND I ALSO NEED A MOTION TO MOVE THIS BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN MOVED BY MISTER A MULLIN EARLIER. TYPE I NEED A SECOND. HOPE YOU HAVE TAKE YOU THROUGH I DO I HAVE A SECOND. SECOND IT SO YOU MAY CLOSE UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND DOT YES WE WILL -- BE WORKING CLOSELY WE ALREADY ARE BEGINNING THAT PROCESS WITH MISTER SANTIAGO AND WE STRONGLY WELCOME THE PARTICIPATION OF YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF SO WE APPRECIATE. OUR THAT WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US. I YOU KNOW I I I AGREE ABOUT BRIDGE COMPETITION IS GREAT. ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES THAT ONLY HAVE ONE BRIDGE. THE LOT OF PLACES IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE THAT ONLY HAVE EFFECTIVELY. ONE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER MAYBE THEY HAVE -- TO THE BUT OFTEN THOSE ONE SO IT'S NOT THE KIND OF OUR FREE RANGING OPEN MARKET -- DIED CAN OFTEN LEAD TO GOOD OFFER CONSUMERS. ARE AND SO WHEN YOU DO. HAVE. EITHER ONE BRIDGE OR MAYBE OF A BRIDGE IT'S FAR AWAY FROM OTHER BRIDGE IS SO IT'S EFFECTIVELY A MONOPOLY OR MAYBE IT'S A DUOPOLY. AND THEN THE BRIDGE THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA BUY A PRODUCE COMPANY. BECAUSE I WANT TO DO THAT -- AND I'M GONNA SAY THAT ONLY MY PRODUCE CUTS ACROSS THE BRIDGE. THOSE OTHER GUYS THEIR PRODUCE SOMETHING UP ACROSS THE BRIDGE OR WIN A CHARGE ON BOAT LOAD OF MONEY. TO DO IT. I AND IF THEY DON'T PAY AT AND THEY CAN'T CROSS THE BRIDGE. AND I'M GONNA COMPLAIN THAT IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING US NOT MONEY OF WERE NOT ALLOWED. TO GET THE MONEY OUT OF THEM THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RAISE YOUR PRICES -- THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THIS IS ABOUT WE WANT. OPEN COMPETITION. AND YOUR OF OPEN COMPETITION WHERE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A MONOPOLY OR A DUOPOLY. ON WHAT INFORMATION GETS TO YOU. DON'T HAVE RULES. TELLING THEM NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THAT'S ANTI CONSUMER ITS ANTI INNOVATION IT'S ANTI -- COMPETITION YOU CAN DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IT IS HOT. THOSE BRIEFS AGROUND OR THAT I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY IF THE SAME PEOPLE OF KIM COMPANIES OPPOSING THIS BILL HADN'T GONE. TO THE TRUMP FCC AND SAID PLEASE GET RID OF THE OBAMA NET NEUTRALITY ORDER STATE IN SUCH STOP NOT SAGA THEY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN MAKING IT HAPPEN AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO DO THAT IT'S A FREE COUNTRY TO DEMOCRACY IN THAT. THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD TO THE POSITION BUT THEN YOU CAN COME BACK AND SAY. DON'T HAVE A PATCHWORK THAT PATRICK WAS CREATED BY THIS. A VACUUM AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY AND I'M GOING TO RAISE IT HERE SHE'S ABSOLUTE RIGHT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PASS SOMETHING AND GET THE GOVERNOR TO DECIDE. I KNOW THAT IMPLICIT IN WHAT SHE SAID WAS SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY GOT THE JOB DONE ON I'M NOT INTERESTED AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE IF THIS BILL REMAINS THE WAY IT IS TODAY -- I WILL WITHDRAW. ON BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH PASS AND ACTUALLY GET THE JOB DONE -- AND SO I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH BOTH COMMITTEES -- AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO PASS A STRONG THAT NEUTRALITY BILL THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF AND BE A LEADER IN THE NATION SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIBEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A NATION IS TO PASS -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL REAL. MOTION IS DE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS CHAO AYE CHAU AYE KILEY. KILEY NO BAKER. BAKER AYE BERMAN. BERMAN AYE CALDERON. CALDERON AYE GABRIEL. GABRIEL I IRWIN -- WHEN I AM MULLIN? MULLIN I OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NO [inaudible] REYES. YOUR BILL IS HOUSE SEVENTY TWO WILL LEAVE THE ROAD OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN THANK YOU COLLEAGUES [inaudible] ALL [inaudible] OH SURE YEAH. SENATOR HAS JUST WALKED IN OKAY FINE ALRIGHT [inaudible] MARGARET [inaudible] SELECT CHIU. WE JUST DIDN'T GO -- OKAY HOME [inaudible] YEAH DOT SURE AND WHEN THAT I NOTICE -- SENATOR HILL IS HERE ON AND HE'S GOING TO PRESENT ON SP ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX A WELCOME SIGN TO HELP. YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND A IN COLLEAGUES AT THE ELEVEN EIGHTIES. SURE IS THAT STATE LAW KEEPS UP WITH THE LAUNCH WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ADOPTION SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES. SURVEILLANCE TACTICS ARE EVOLVING RAPIDLY AND HAVE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. WHILE SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT WE HAVE NO REASONABLE RIGHT TO THE BREATH AND PERVASIVENESS OF SURVEILLANCE TODAY CHALLENGES THIS NOTION. THE POLICE WANT TO SEARCH YOUR PHONE YOUR CAR OR YOUR HOUSE THEY HAVE TO GET A WARRANT. BUT MANY AGENCIES HAVE TECHNOLOGY THE CONTRACT WHERE YOU GO WHO YOU TALK TO AND WHAT YOU SAY IN PUBLIC PLACES WITHOUT ANY SAFEGUARDS. IN A LANDMARK DECISION LAST WEEK THE US SUPREME COURT RULED LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS A WARRANT. IF IT WANTS TO TRACK IN INDIVIDUALS LOCATION THROUGH CELLPHONE RECORDS. WELL THE DECISION NARROWLY APPLIES TO CELL PHONE LOCATION DATA THERE ARE THEMES IN THE COURT'S DECISION THAT ARE APPLICABLES SB. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX WELL THE COURT NOTES THAT PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE DIMINISHED WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS IN A PUBLIC PLACE. THIS DOES NOT MEAN ALL FOURTH AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS ARE SURRENDER. THE OPINION SAYS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IN THE WHOLE OF THEIR PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS. THE COURT ADDS THAT TRACKING SOMEONE WITH SUCH INVASIVE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY OVER TIME NOT ONLY REVEALS MOVEMENTS BUT ALSO FAMILIAL. POLITICAL PROFESSIONAL RELIGIOUS AND SEXUAL ASSOCIATIONS. THE USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY HAVE UNPRECEDENTED IMPACTS ON OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS IT CAN CAPTURE A DETAILED LOG OF YOUR ACTIONS EVERY DAY EVERY MOMENT AND OVER SEVERAL YEARS. GEN SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY CAPTURES DATA ON EVERYONE IN ITS PATH NOT JUST THOSE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. IT IS ONLY FAIR. THAT SUCH SWEEPING ABILITY TO MONITOR CITIZENS IS DONE WITH TRANSPARENCY AND RESPECT FOR PRIVATE PERSONAL PRIVACY SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX WILL REQUIRE THAT SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES BE SUBJECT. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE AND LOCAL LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED TRANSPARENCY RULES FOR AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READERS. AND CELL PHONE INTERCEPTED VICES THESE LAWS REQUIRE SIMPLE DISCLOSURES LIKE THE AUTHOR RIGHT AUTHORIZED PURPOSE OF USING THIS SURVEILLANCE. HOW THE LOCAL AGENCY WERE MONITOR USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY? AND HOW INFORMATION WILL BE STORED AND SHARED. WITH THE AMENDMENTS MADE AND SENATE APPROPRIATIONS S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX APPLIES THE SAME POLICY IN PLACE FOR LICENSE PLATE READERS. AND CELLPHONE INTERCEPTED BY SIR TO ALL SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES AN EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE PROVISION TO ALLOW THE USE OF UNAPPROVED SURVEILLANCE DEVICES IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS WILL ARGUE THAT CREATING TRANSPARENCY PROVIDES A SURVEILLANCE ROAD MAP TO CRIMINALS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE THE MERE KNOWLEDGE OF A POLICE TACTIC DOES NOT RENDER IT USELESS. THERE ARE ALREADY LAWS MANDATING THE DISCLOSURE OF WIRE TAPS AND LICENSE PLATE READERS AND BOTH TECHNOLOGIES STILL HELP CATCH CRIMINALS. SOME CONCERNS MAY ALSO BE EXPRESSED BY THE BREATH OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES COVERED BY THE BILL. S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX RECOGNIZES THE WIDE EVER CHANGING ARRAY OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES AT THE DISPOSAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. THE GOAL IS TO BE SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO CAPTURE THE APPROPRIATE SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BUT NOT NARAL NOT OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE. SURE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO RUN A BILL EACH TIME AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES INVENTED I LIKE TO MAKE ONE THING VERY CLEAR. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT LONG FORSMAN FROM USING SICK TECHNOLOGY SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO FIGHT CRIME. SIMPLY TAKES EXISTING STANDARDS FOR LICENSE PLATE READERS AND CELLPHONE INTERCEPTED VICES. IN APPLIES INTO ALL SURVEILLANCE DEVICES. AS THE SUPREME COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY RULED ARKANSAS CONSTITUTION SEEKS TO SECURE THE ARBITRARY POWER. ADDITIONALLY A CENTRAL GOAL OF THE FRAMERS WAS TO PLACE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY. OF A TWO PERMEATING SURVEY POLICE SURVEILLANCE. WE NEED TO KEEP THESE PRINCIPLES% IN MIND AS NEW TECHNOLOGY FORCES US TO EXAMINE PRIVACY RIGHTS IN THIS DIGITAL AGE. I SUPPORT USING TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT WE NEED TO SAFEGUARD BASIC CIVIL LIBERTIES FROM POTENTIAL ABUSES I DO HAVE WITNESSES AND SOME. CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR LET'S GO TO OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS TO COMMITTEES ANALYSIS REFLECTS. THIS IS A BILL THAT'S REALLY ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THROUGH LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS I'M AS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL VALUES AND PRIORITIES ARE REFLECTED IN LOCAL AND PUBLIC SAFETY DECISIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONCERNS THAT US UNDER HILL A OUTLINED A JUST NOTE. THAT THE COLLECTION OF THIS INFORMATION HAS. RAMIFICATIONS IN IT AN EVEN BROADER WAYS AND SOME. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN -- THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MIGHT USED LICENSE PLATE READERS FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE SEEN THAT THE IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HAVE TAPPED INTO THAT DATABASE AND ARE USING THAT INFORMATION TO TRACK IMMIGRANTS FOR ENFORCEMENT. EFFORTS IN -- IN CALIFORNIA -- AND IN OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET SOME SUNSHINE ON THAT WE HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY -- FORCED TO SUE A ICE ON FOR ACCESS TO THOSE PUBLIC RECORD SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IS VERY SENSITIVE AND AND HAS RAMIFICATIONS OF WAYS THAT YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE APPARENT -- AT FIRST BLUSH AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND AND PUBLIC TRUST IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE BILL THAT YOU I SAW AND APPROVED LAST YEAR AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MY CHAIR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CATHERINE CRIER BUT I'M AN ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL RIGHT DIRECT THE SAMUELSON CLINIC FOR LAW TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX WHICH WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. TO OBTAIN PUBLIC APPROVAL WHEN THEY ADOPT SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. I AM ONE OF MORE THAN A DOZEN CALIFORNIA BASED LAW PROFESSORS AND INFORMATION SCHOOL PROFESSORS AND AFFILIATES INCLUDING DEAN IRWIN CHEMERINSKY TO JOIN A LETTER SUPPORTING THIS BILL. AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAKE IT EVER EASIER TO COLLECT RETAIN SHARE AND ANALYZE INFORMATION ABOUT PRIVATE CITIZENS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND OFTEN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX WHO PUT ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND THREW THEM THEIR CONSTITUENTS. I IN CHARGE OF DECIDING WHEN TO DEPLOY THESE POWERFUL TECHNOLOGIES IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. TODAY'S SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT MARGINAL IMPROVEMENTS ON EXISTING TOOLS. THEIR REAL GAME CHANGERS FOR EXAMPLE WITH AN AUTOMATIC LICENSE PLATE READER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN WITH LITTLE EFFORT AND LITTLE EXPENSE LOG MILLIONS OF LOCATION TRACKING DATA POINTS ABOUT WHERE INDIVIDUALS TRAVEL ON MASS SCALE WITH NO SUSPICION. LICENSE PLATE READERS CAN HELP COMBAT CRIME. BUT THEY CAN ALSO IMPLICATE IMPORTANT AND CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS. WHEN LONG FORSMAN AGENCIES USE A LICENSE PLATE READER TO LOG ATTENDEES AT A MOSQUE AS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST THEY IMPLICATE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM? WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE LICENSE PLATE READERS TO LOG ATTENDEES AS A POLITICAL AT A POLITICAL PROTEST WHICH HAS ALSO HAPPENED IN THE PAST THAT IMPLICATES FREE SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY? AT AND AS MISTER BAKER MENTIONED IN A WORLD WHERE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES ARE WELL DOCUMENTED USERS OF SHARED LICENSE PLATE READER DATA A STATE THAT HAS PROCLAIM ITSELF STINKS YOU A STATE. OUGHT TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL ABOUT WITH WHOM THEY SHARE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION. DEPLOYMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY RAISES THORNY ISSUES ABOUT VALUES THOSE VALUES INCLUDE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT THEY ALSO INCLUDE FREE SPEECH PRIVACY AND OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. IT TAKES NOTHING AWAY FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN DECIDING HOW SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED. THEY SHOULD NOT BEAR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING THESE TRADE OFFS. THESE SORTS OF IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE EXACTLY THE TYPE OF DECISIONS WE EXPECT LOCAL OF REP ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THEIR THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE JOB BECAUSE THEIR BEST INFORMED ABOUT THINGS. LIKE THE LEVEL OF LOCAL CRIME THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE COMMUNITIES VALUES [inaudible] UP THIS BILL IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS MY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- TO MAKE AID AVAILABLE TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES -- TO ACQUIRE POLICE EQUIPMENT AND MELODY OFTEN IN THE NAME OF COMBATING TERRORISM BUT THAT EQUIPMENT IS MORE OFTEN USED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN ROUTINE POLICE SURVEILLANCE. AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT MONEY HAS LOOSENED LOCAL CONTROL OVER POLICE SURVEILLANCE THIS BILL WOULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND HELPING TO WRITE THE BALANCE. THANK YOU FOR HEARING FROM ME TODAY AND I LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTER OF THE LEGISLATION PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEING NONE ARE OPPOSITION LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME UP PER WELCOME ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. SURE MEMBERS JONATHAN FELT OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION I ONE OF OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS IS THAT. BY FORCING US. TO SPEAK ABOUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN FRONT OF A LOCAL GOVERNING BOARD OF PUBLIC HEARING. WHERE ANYONE CAN ASK ANY QUESTIONS ANYTHING TO BE DISCUSSED? ARE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE HAVE TO DEVOTE SOME OF OUR TACTICS ARE STRATEGIES BEHIND THE USE OF THE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH NOT EXPRESSLY REQUIRED OF US IN THE BILL. I COULD HAPPEN AND BECAUSE THE BILL SO BROAD AND COVER SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS BILLS WHICH WE HAVE WORKED ON AND A COMPROMISED ON AND ACTUALLY -- WE'RE PART OF THAT SUCCESSFUL PROCESS BUT IT WAS A PLACE THIS ONE IS JUST SO BROAD WE HAVE WE HAVE. GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT HAS ON SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S EMERGING NOW IN SOME STUFF THAT COULD COME IN THE FUTURE. WE TALKED ABOUT ONE OF THE PROPONENTS TALK ABOUT THIS BEING ALL ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. THERE'S LOCAL CONTROL INVOLVED RIGHT NOW ON THE USE OF THIS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY ANY CITY COUNCIL CAN GO TO THE POLICE CHIEF AND ASK THEM WHAT ARE YOU USING HOW ARE USING IT OR SET SOME KIND OF POLICY IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS. PRESCRIBING UPON LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXACTLY HOW YOU HAVE TO DO THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY TYING THEIR HANDS ITS NOT -- GIVING THEM MORE CONTROL IT'S GIVING THEM LESS CONTROL. WE TALKED ABOUT -- THE AUTHOR TALK ABOUT THE COURTS COMING UP WITH A DECISION LIMITING OUR USE OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY THE COURTS ARE. WHERE WE HAVE HISTORICALLY SEEN -- LIMITS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT USE. OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY INTO THE PRIVATE. LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS DRAW THE LINE WHAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE. WE CANNOT VIOLATE SOMEONE'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY. THAT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION. AND THE COURTS HAVE BEEN THE THE BODY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY COME TO SET THE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR OUR USE -- FOR EXAMPLE I CANNOT COME PARK OUTSIDE SOMEONE IF I WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T COMPARTO PARK OUTSIDE OF SOMEONE'S HOUSE WITH THERMAL RADAR AND FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE INSIDE THE HOUSE WITHOUT A WARRANT. I CAN'T VIOLATE THEIR PRIVACY JUST BECAUSE I HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD DO IT. THERE ARE LIMITS IN PLACE IN THE COURTS OF SET THOSE LIMBS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE THE COURTS AREN'T ALWAYS AWARE OF WHAT WE HAVE. AND SO IF THIS IS. THE ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT. US DISCLOSING WHAT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY IN SURVEILLANCE WERE HAVING THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE CAN HAVE BUT THERE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL. THE EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE EXEMPTION IS IS RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS. IT'S IS THE WEEKENDS ONLY USE WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRE FOR THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WHICH I MEAN THESE ARE SOMETIMES VERY EXPENSIVE PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU CAN'T JUST PURCHASE. FOR A FEW DAYS JUST YOU KNOW. BECAUSE THERE'S AN EMERGENCY AND INCOME GIVE IT RIGHT BACK I MEAN THEIR RETURN POLICY IT'S NOT NORDSTROM'S -- WHICH CAN ONLY COLLECT INFORMATION THAT SOLELY RELATED TO THE EMERGENCY SO IF I'M. A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT CLAYTON YOU KNOW ACQUIRE SOME PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE IT THERE WAS A KIDNAPPING I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE BUT ALONG THE ROUTE I FIND INFORMATION ABOUT. A SEPARATE MURDER ARE SEPARATE RATE OR SEPARATE. KIDNAPPING I CAN'T COLLECT IN STORE THAT INFORMATION I'VE TO JETTISON IT BECAUSE THE BILL DOES NOT ALLOW ITS TO HOLD. THE BILL SAYS ONLY [inaudible] A INFORMATION RELATED TO THAT EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE CAN BE RETAINED -- AND WE HAVE TO RETURN THE EQUIPMENT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS ARE AT THE END OF THE EXHAUSTION CIRCUMSTANCE. SO AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT JUST TECHNOLOGY CAN PURCHASE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN THE RETURN -- YOU KNOW FOR ALL THOSE REASONS YOU KNOW WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. EMERGING TECHNOLOGY IS GONNA. COME WITH SOME SOME NEW RESTRICTIONS AND THERE HAS TO BE CONVERSATION ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT USE ONE OF RELATES TO PRIVACY BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS GONNA HELP US PREVENT SOME REALLY BAD INCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING. I MEAN FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THE OTHER TYPE OF DETECTION SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE ON PLACE. ARE GOING TO SAVE LIVES AND SO BY PUTTING RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE THAT ARE. OVERLY BURDENSOME ARE PRACTICALLY. NOT IMPLEMENTABLE ARGH GUN LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SAVE LIVES AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WHEN HIS PLACE THANK MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SHAUN OFTEN OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION I WOULD ECHO ALL OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE -- ALSO POINT OUT IN THE CASE OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND SHERIFF'S WE HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THIS LEGISLATION AND GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION TWENTY FIVE THREE A THREE WHICH IS VERY EXPLICIT IN. THAT IT SAYS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SHALL NOT OBSTRUCT THE INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE SHERIFF AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WE BELIEVE THAT GIVING A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE A FORTY TO SAY YES OR NO ON OUR USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. VIOLATE SECTION TWENTY FIVE THREE A THREE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE BILL SHALL BE. SHALL LIMIT THE APPLICATION OF TWENTY FIVE THREE THREE BUT THEN IN THAT CASE WERE BEING REQUIRED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION THAT THEY CAN'T DENY SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHAT THE BENEFIT WOULD BE OF DOING THAT. I SP TWENTY ONE WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR THAT PROVISION WAS REMOVED WE HAD TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE WE DEPLOY ANY SORT OF A SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. BUT IT DID NOT REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- WE BELIEVE THAT THAT. AT LEAST ADDRESSES THE TWENTY FIVE THREE AND THREE ISSUE WOULD STILL HAVE CONCERNS -- WITH WITH SORT OF THE THE ROAD MAP ISSUE THAT -- THE MY COLLEAGUE ALLUDED TO BUT WE BELIEVE AS DRAFTED THIS BILL VIOLATES THE AYE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY OF THE SHERIFFS AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION TWENTY FIVE THREE A THREE FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. I CAN MUCH YEAH ADDITIONAL ON INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION THAT A BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN RESOLUTION MUCH LARA AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU AN EXPLICIT. BRADY PARA THERE AGREED DISSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF POOR ACTUAR OPPOSED I CAN MUCH NEXT PLACE. CHAIRMAN MACHINE LEVINE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CESSATION FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE LONG BEACH POLICE OFFICER ASSOCIATION SACRAMENTO DEPUTY SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SO SURCHARGE COUNTY DEPARTURES DROPS OF I CAN MUCH NEXT PLACE. CHAIRMAN MORAL MARSHALL ON BEHALF OF SHERIFF BILL GORE IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE LIEUTENANT SHIRLEY SO WILLIAM SAMBAR MEDINA SHERIFF'S ON BEHALF OF JOHN MCMAHON. IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. NEXT PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN IS NOT THE CYBERLINK WE HAVE OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFFS IN THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE BOTH THE POST THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATCHA COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SENATOR I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT [inaudible] PRIVACY AND I AM VERY BADLY WANT TO GET THERE WITH YOU HERE ON THIS BILL. A BUT I'M I'M STRUGGLING A SO. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SENATOR LENO HAD THE ELECTRONIC MICHIGAN DUPLICATION PRIVACY ACT. AND I WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THAT I WAS FLOOR MANAGER OF THE BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS A HEAVY LEFT I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT IT ON CALL. TWICE BEFORE WE GOT IT -- PASSED THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY ARE FOUGHT FOR THAT BILL SO I AM A BELIEVER IN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH HERE IS THAT? THIS BILL WORDS SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY SO BROADLY. THAT I THINK IT COVERS A LOT OF SITUATIONS WHERE. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POINT YOUR YOUR ATTENTION WAS TO PAINT THIS ISSUE WITH A BROAD BRUSH SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK. INTERPRETED REINTERPRETED EVERYTIME WE'VE GOT NEW TECHNOLOGY. RELEASED BUT I'M AFRAID THAT WERE CAPTURED. PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT AND SAY -- YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT IS A REASONABLE USE OF TECHNOLOGY HOW WE ARE TO BE COUPLE EXAMPLES OF IF SOMEONE. I'VE TAKES A PICTURE OF A PERSON IN A BATHROOM STALL WE WE WE THE COURTS HAVE RULED WE CAN WE ALL AGREE. THAT THAT IN A BATHROOM STALL YOU HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IF SOMEONE TAKES A PICTURE OF YOU WALKING INTO A RESTAURANT. I THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY NO YOU DON'T HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY THERE YOUR CARS IN THE PARKING LOT OF MANY PEOPLE SAW YOU WALK IN THERE PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT THE TO SING DOWN EATING THEIR DINNER. THAT SAW YOU SIT DOWN -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT REASONABLE FOR YOU TO EXPECT THAT THE FACT THAT YOU WERE THERE. IS NOT PUBLIC INFORMATION SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT A TECHNOLOGY THAT PUTS A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON A A STREET LAMP FOR EXAMPLE. AND PERHAPS USES FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE WALKING INTO A RESTAURANT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU HAD. A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THAT SITUATION SO THE QUESTION IS I MEAN WHAT. I TELL ME THAT I'M WRONG THERE TELL ME WHY ASH I I SHOULD HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. WHEN THERE ARE MANY OTHER FORMS OF LESS TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED SURVEILLANCE THAT WOULD REVEAL THE SAME INFORMATION I GUESS IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR THROUGH A THROUGH THE CHAIR ON THIS THIS? THIS ISSUE I THINK THE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IS NOT WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET IN THAT CAMERA THAT BLUE LIGHT THAT YOU SEE DOWN THE STREET HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IS TAKING A PICTURE OF YOU BUT IT'S WHEN THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN THEN THE ONE AT THE NEXT CORNER TAKEN THE NEXT CORNER TODAY AND FIND WHERE YOU PARK YOUR CAR WHERE YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR TAKE YOUR FACIAL RECOGNITION WHAT YOU GOING TO THE STORE. COME OUT THEN TAKE YOUR PICTURE DOWN THE STREET AND AND HAS A UP A MAP OF WHERE YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE. THEN THEY CAN USE THAT INFORMATION FOR HOWEVER THEY WANT TO USE IT THAT'S THE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY HAVE WHEN WHEN YOU'RE. IT JUST IS GPS USE IS NOT FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLLOW YOU INTO TRACK WHERE YOU'RE GOING. THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE WHEN THEY USE THAT INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY THE POLICIES IMPORTANT HOW THE UC INFORMATION HOW LONG THEY KEEP THAT INFORMATION WHO HAS ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AS WE SAW WITH LICENSE PLATE READERS WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST BASIC FORM. OF THAT TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE BECAUSE IT GETS YOUR VEHICLE AS IT DID WHEN I GAVE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR MY WIFE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER AND SURE ENOUGH THE FOUNDER. CAR WHERE SHE GOES APPEARED AT A GYM ON WEDNESDAY SO I MEAN IT CAN BE TRACKED AND USED IN A WAY THAT IS. IS NOT WHAT WE WOULD WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE IT FOR NOT THAT THEY WOULD DO IT BUT IT'S JUST HOW LONG IT WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO IS I'D LIKE TO ASK ASK MY WITNESS OF THEY HAVE ANOTHER. A BIT OF INFORMATION THAT COULD I THINK THE ARGUE THAT POINT MISTER VOTE NO TO I WOULD ONLY POINT OUT THAT THE BILL DOESN'T PROHIBIT ANY KIND OF SURVEILLANCE IT ALLOWS THESE DECISIONS TO BE MADE AT A LOCAL LEVEL. AND IN FACT YOUR COMMUNITY MAY DECIDE THAT IT WANTS TO EMBRACE ALL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND USE IT WITHOUT LIMITATION AND THAT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE UNDER THE BILL. OKAY I'D I RESPECT THE ANSWER THAT WE COMPLETELY AGREE. WITH THAT WERE IN FURIOUS AGREEMENT AS EIGHT SAY -- EXCEPT FOR THIS YOU KNOW I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S THE WAY THAT THE DATA IS THAT'S AGGREGATED THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME TROUBLING PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS. THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS WORDED THE SITUATION THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THAT WOULD BE OKAY WITH YOU THAT THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA WITH THE BLUE LIGHT. AND JUST YOU KNOW THE ONE INSTANCE IF YOU WALK INTO A RESTAURANT THAT ALSO WOULD REQUIRE DISCLOSURE. UNDER THE BILL AND SO IF IF IT'D BEEN WORDED IN A WAY THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE SELECTIVE I THINK I'D BE ABLE TO GET THERE BUT AFTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AND IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IF IT IF IT EVER GETS NARROWED TO THE POINT WHERE. WHERE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YES A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD SAY YOU DO HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY UNDER THE CONDITIONS WHICH COVERS ARE BE HAVING TO SWITCH OVER TO SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR WITNESSES THE MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR THAT YOU BRING THE BILL FORWARD -- IMAD THINK IN TERMS OF PRIVACY THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT OPPOSITION TO HAVE -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WHAT WE WORK ON HERE -- YEAH I THINK IN SUPPORT OF OVERALL THE CONCEPT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT MOVING FOR MY CONCERN IS GONNA BE. OUT TO GUYS I I HAVE BOTH -- CITY SO I AM PLEASED TO FIVE CITY POLICE OFFICERS TO HANDLE BOTH THE CITY OF WHITTIER CITY SANTA FE SPRINGS AND MY DISTRICT AND ALSO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFER THE REST MY CITIES. AND I AND I AND I WHAT I DON'T WANT AND I THINK WE DO AT TIMES HERE IN SACRAMENTO HAT WE LIMIT. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO KEEP US SAFE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND YOU KNOW AND WHEN WHEN I APPROACH. OUR LOCAL ON FORCE AND LIKE THE POLICE CHIEF AFTER THE CITY OF WHITTIER THE ISSUE USUALLY TENDS TO BE WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A SET OF RESOURCES. IN ORDER TO HOT SETTLE YOUR FIX YOUR ISSUES AND SO WHEN I MOVED INTO A COMMUNITY IN UPTOWN WHITTIER -- I NAY BECOMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CHASING PEOPLE DOWN OR CHASE PEOPLE OUT OF OUR COMMUNITY WITH MAG LIFE ASSET FLASHLIGHT -- BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT THE CAPACITY FOR THAT FOR OUR LOCALS AS CITY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT I THINK SURVEILLANCE IS. IS SOMETHING THAT ARE A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO LIVE MY COMMUNITY WOULD BE APPRECIATIVE OF WE HAVE IT -- AT THE KIND OF THE WAY GETTING PART OF OUR COMMUNITY WHEN WE INSTALLED THE CAMERA OUR SELVES GET THE COLLECTED INFORMATION AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD NOT TAKING TOOLS AWAY. OFF FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB TO KEEP US SAFE BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE UP HERE. TO TO MAINTAIN IS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND PROTECTED AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE THE TOOLS TO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THEN ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO BE ABLE TO THAT BEING ABLE TO DISCUSS INFORMATION -- PUBLICLY I YEAH I I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE INPUT FROM THE CITY COUNCIL WHEN IT COMES TO THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE DAILY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES LOCALLY. ARE AND THEY SHOULD BE TRUSTED AND IF THEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED IN THEIR CHECK THAT CHANGE NEEDS TO BE MADE AYE AND WE CAN ALWAYS BE THE ONES MAKING THAT CHANGE FOR THEM -- BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD SOMETIMES IT'S BAD NONE THE LESS WERE ALWAYS TAKEN -- THE NONSENSE FOR IT -- BUT I TIMES AYE I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT IN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE IF THERE ARE TIMES WHERE A CONVERSATION ARE NOT IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT DETERMINATION TO BE MADE. BY THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS BECAUSE IT. IT IN CONCEPT YOU ARE SPEAKING TO THE THE THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING TO AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTED BY THE ELECTORATE. TO TAKE CARE OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WAS OTHER COUPLE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IN THE THING MOVING FORWARD I'D REALLY APPRECIATE ATTENTION IN ADDRESSING. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WE'VE BEEN. BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT IN THE THE QUESTION CAME UP ABOUT HAVING. THIS IN CLOSED SESSION FOR A LOCAL FOR A CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS WE KNOW WHAT THE BROWN ACT. THIS DOES NOT FIT WITHIN ONE OF THOSE -- FOR BROWN ACT CLOSED SESSION CONVERSATIONS AND SO WE'RE STILL LOOKING AND TRYING TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT FOR THAT AS WELL AND I AGREE WITH. WITH YOU ON ALLOWING AND AND MAKING SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TO HAVE THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THE ONLY CONDITION AND THE ONLY REASON FOR MOVING THIS AND I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE IS CONCERNED IS THAT WHICH ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE CIVILIAN BODY MAKES THOSE DECISIONS THAT AND UNDERSTANDS AND KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS ARE UTILIZED IN USING WHO HAS ACCESS. TO IT HOW LONG WE KEEP THE DATA WHAT WOULD CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE IN PLACES THAT THERE AREN'T THE ABUSES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE AND CERTAINLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT% OCCURS ON A ON GOING BASIS ANYWHERE. BUT IT'S THAT FEAR THAT I THINK WE HAVE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES THAT. THAT WE DON'T KNOW OF YET AND IN WOULD YOU KNOW THAT THE THE OPPOSITION WAS TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT. I THOUGHT WERE WERE -- INTERESTING ONE YOU KNOW MENTIONING THAT UP -- IT WASN'T JUST THE ONE ISSUE WHICH HAPPEN WELL ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN IN THAT IN IT'S NOT MENTIONED IN THE BILL AND IN. EVERY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF TECH. YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T MIND IT WAS LICENSE PLATE READERS FOR THEY WERE OPPOSED THERE DIDN'T SUPPORT THE BILL CERTAINLY BUT THAT THEY WEREN'T IS. ADAMANT ABOUT IT WITH LICENSE PLATE READERS OR CELL INTERCEPT TECHNOLOGY. BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S A REAL FEAR AS I GUESS WOULD WOULD GETS ME GOING A LITTLE BIT IS. WHAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY DO THEY NOT WANT US TO KNOW ABOUT? AND SHOULDN'T WE KNOW ABOUT THAT TECHNOLOGY. I UNDERSTAND WE WANT WE KNOW WHAT THE BAD GUY TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CENTER NOTE BUT THEY'RE PROVIDENCE AHEAD OF US AND WHAT WE KNOW BUT THAT'S THE FEAR I HAVE. IS WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY NOW THAT THEY MAY NOT WANT US TO KNOW ABOUT. THAT THEY'RE USING TO THAT COULD ACTUALLY AG I'M I WAS MORE NERVOUS AFTER THE TESTIMONY TODAY THAN I WAS BEFORE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ITS GOODNESS REYES FOLLOWED BY MISS IRWIN AND AND MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OUT IT TO TO AREAS THAT I WANTED TO DISCUSS SENATOR ONE IS DE I I THINK WITHOUT A DOUBT THERE HAS TO BE THIS BALANCE. OH WE DO WANT THAT. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY BUT WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THAT PROTECTIONS. TO ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS -- AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING TOWARDS THAT AND AYE I SUPPORT YOU IN THAT. ARE THE OTHER IT HAS TO DO WITH OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. ARE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DA AND THE SHERIFF THOSE ARE BOTH ELECTED. AND THEY ARE INDEPENDENT AND TO HAVE TO HAVE THEM NOW COME BEFORE THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IF THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE -- AND SO FINDING LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS THEM THAT INDEPENDENCE PRESENTING IT TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AYE I THINK WOULD BE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE BUT TO SEEK THEIR APPROVAL. DOES NOT ALLOW THEM THE INDEPENDENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT CODE. INTENDED FOR THEMAS ELECTED OFFICIALS SO THOSE ARE THE TWO AREAS THAT YEAH THAT NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME. TO TO VOTE AGAINST IT I DO WANT THAT YOUR YOUR BILL TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I DO WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. A WATCH THAT CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE AND I'VE REALLY GOT ESTA -- TO RAISE IT WE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN. DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THAT CERTAINLY THE THE THE THE OPINION IN THE LIST OF IN THE ANALYSIS TODAY -- SURLIS CONTRARY TO WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO TO RELIEF HAVE FINE TUNE THAT AND AND HONE IN ON THAT THAT DEFINITION AND TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT -- THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS SHARE FOR D. A TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES THEM TO DO -- AND WE RESPECT THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND AND IT SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT AND SO WE WILL WE WILL. LOOK AT THAT A LOT CLOSER IN THE NEXT -- IF THE BILL MOVES TODAY ROOM TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PART OF THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU SENATOR. RESERVOIR. YES I AM VOTED ON THIS BILL I THINK WAS TWO YEARS AGO AND AT THAT TIME THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TAKEN INCLUDING I BELIEVE THAT THE SHERIFFS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT AND AND I DO AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY HAS SAID. THEY ARE US. INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED OFFICIALS THE DA AND SHERIFF CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. AND I DON'T THINK IT IS FOR ME IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE THAT THEY HAVE TO GO IN FRONT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SO. I THINK THIS IS THAT BALANCE THAT -- A NUMBER OF MEMBERS HAVE MENTIONED IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT UNLESS THE SHERIFF'S. DAYS ARE -- TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL LIKE THEY WERE THE LAST TIME I VOTED FOR THE BILL I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING IT ON THE FLOOR BUT AS I MENTIONED I WILL SUPPORT TODAY. REGULAR IMAGES. AREN'T MISTER BERMAN FOLLOWED BY THIS TO GABRIEL. THEORY MUCH US SO THREE YEARS AGO OR SO. A FORMER STAFFER OF YOURS WHO IT WHO WAS A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT THAT TIME ON THE PULSE OF CITY COUNCIL. A CAME TO ME WITH THIS IDEA -- AND THAT'S WHERE I THOUGHT I THOUGHT. I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND SO HE AND I OTHER COLLEAGUE WORK TO CREATE THIS POLICY FOR THE CITY OF PALO ALTO -- WHO I THINK IS STALLED -- GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING EXACTLY. WHAT THAT POLICY WOULD BE -- I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT WAS LAST YEAR UP AS SOME OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED IT WAS IF THERE WAS DIFFERENCES -- AND SOME PARTS ABOUT THIS BILL ARE BETTER IN SOME PARTS ABOUT THIS BILL OR WORSE -- WHICH RELATED TO BUY SOME COLLEAGUES SAID THIS ONE I THAT ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP ON WORKING ON SOME OF THOSE DETAILS -- I LIKE THE VERSION LAST YEAR BETTER -- AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY AND BUY IT PRE* YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND FIND WAYS TO THAT AND YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE APPLICABLE SAID -- FOLKS THAT AREN'T -- THEM SO [inaudible] MR GABRIEL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FOR I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION AND I I I APOLOGIZE I'M NEW HERE SO I DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT THE HISTORY OF THE FOLKS ARE SITTING AROUND THIS TABLE WHO VOTE ON THIS. PREVIOUSLY AND SO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS YOU RAISED AROUND EXIGENCY ARKHAM STANCE AS THE GOVERNMENT CODE I GUESS WE WOULD CALL SORT OF REVEALING SOURCES AND METHODS. MY QUESTION ARE IS IF SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY VERSION OF THIS BILL THAT YOU BE COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING [inaudible] YEAH -- SO TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR. I WE BASICALLY CAME IN AND SAID LOOK THERE'S THERE'S ROOM FOR US TO WORK WE WORKED ON THE LICENSE PLATE READ A BILL WE WORKED ON THE STING RAY BILL WITH THE AUTHOR -- BUT THAT THAT PUBLIC HEARING IS A NON STARTER SO WE CAN MOVE PAST THAT THEN THERE'S ROOM FOR US TO START NARROWING THE DEFINITION AND WORKING ON EVERYTHING ELSE BUT WE'VE. WE'VE YET TO BE ABLE TO GET PAST THAT HURDLE. SO THE THE FACT THAT THERE IS STILL A PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING CITY COUNCIL MAY BE CITY MANAGER WEIGH IN ON THE POLICY BUT YOU KNOW THAT WAS THAT WAS THE FIRST HEARD ON WE HAVE A CLEAR TO GET. SPEND YOU KNOW YEAR AND A HALF -- AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THAT WAS A NON STARTER FOR THE POLICE CHIEFS AND UNTIL UNTIL THAT MOVES. YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT THE LIKE I SAID IF THIS WAS ABOUT KNOWING WHAT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE BEEN KNOWING. YOU KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE SO THAT. THERE PUBLIC AWARE OF IT IN THE COURTS ARE AWARE OF IT AND THEY CAN HELP SET THE BOUNDARIES AROUND IT. WHERE WE THINK THAT DISCUSSION IS APPROPRIATE? NO ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHERE THE CONVERSATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY NEVER CLEARED THE FIRST HURDLE. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS OF SCOTT GRETCHEN SORRY JUST TED JUST IF TO FINISH EVER SO I AM YOU KNOW I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO IT TO THE CONCERNS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT I DO THINK THAT -- AS A NUMBER OF MEMBERS HAVE ALLUDED TO THAT THAT THE QUESTION HERE IS BALANCE AND AND WHO IS THE APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKER TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE SO. AM I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT BUT I'M INTERESTED IN. FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH FOLKS ON ALL SIDES OF THIS AND I'M GONNA RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT SEPARATE CLEAR THAT -- WE NEED TO FINE TUNE THIS ABILITY TO PAY MORE. AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING A TODAY'S AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. MOVING FORWARD -- I I SUPPORTED THE YOUR BILL LAST SO TIME AS WELL. AND IS SO QUICK DELIVERS THE MOST OF AND IT'S ALWAYS A FOR A TOUGH TASKS IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCING TELL US IN ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE. YOU HOW OF TRANSPARENCY AND THEN YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THAT WITH PRIVACY OUR LOCAL CONTROL OF BEING PART OF THE EQUATION. ARE IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD HINDER LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM ENFORCING THE LAW.
