WE PARTNER BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. APARTMENTS HUMAN RESOURCES AND STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. YOU KNOW HOW QUORUM WILL START OFFICE COMMITTEE. RIVERSIDE A MUSICIAN NUMBER ONE. ORIGINAL SERVICES CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS SECOND REGION. HI UP MY NAME IS JASON KENNEY I AM THE STSCI ACTING THE PROJECTOR FOR THE REAL ESTATE SERVICES DIVISION FOR TGS. WE HAVE FOUR PROJECTS BEFORE TODAY THE IT WAS P. PRINT PLANT DEMOLITION THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW RICHARD BILL OF OUR COMPLEX. OF THE RENOVATION A GREATLY BATES IN BUILDING AND THE RENOVATION OF THE JUST THE UNDER BUILDING. SINCE THESE ITEMS ARE TOGETHER ON THE AGENDA I'LL RUN THROUGH THEM. QUICKLY ONE OF THE TIME. A THE IT WAS P. PRINT BUT NUMBERLESS XIN. WE ARE REQUESTING INHABITING THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE WORKING DRAWING PHASE FOR THE TOTAL PROJECT COST OF SIXTEEN MILLION. BLASTER LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED. FUNDING FOR PUBLIC PLANS AND US TODAY WE ARE ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET. OF THIS SITE HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR DUMP LA DOT DEVELOPMENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THE CURRENT TENANTS IS A RELOCATING TO US SMALLER MORE EFFICIENTLY SPACE. THIS DEMOLITION ALLOW THE SITE TO BE USED FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND AVOID WARM SHUT DOWN COSTS. THE SECOND PROJECT IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW RICHARD BOULEVARD COMPLEX. FOR THIS PROJECT WE ARE SEEKING EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS POOR PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR DEVELOPMENT UPSET COMPLEX THE TOTAL PROJECT COST IS ESTIMATED AT JUST OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THIS COMPLEX LOW YOU FOR SIX WEEK NICHOLAS DELTA QUEEN. COOPER HERE ALAN CARRERO. CHOI. PROCEED ABSOLUTELY. UP TO THIS COMPLEX IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL SACRAMENTO OFFICE BASED EFFICIENCY OF THE DEFIED IN THE TWENTY A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SACRAMENTO REGION OFFICE PLANNING STUDY AND THEN UPDATE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO LEGISLATORS REQUEST. I IT'S ALSO PART OF OUR SACRAMENTO SEQUENCING PLAN TO DO ADDRESSED EFFICIENT SPACE IN THE CITY. THE PROJECT WILL CONSIST OF OF A CONCEPTUALLY TWENTY NINE STORY TOWER THE HOUSE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICE HOUSING AGENCY IN DEPARTMENTS. OF THREE FIVE STORY BUILDINGS TO HOUSE THE DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. A PARKING GARAGE INSISTED SURFACE PARKING. I'M. THE NEXT PROJECT BEFORE YOU IS THE RENOVATION OF THE GREGORY BATESON BUILDING SO THE GRANT WE'RE REQUESTING FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA TO RENOVATE SAID BUILDING. TOTAL PROJECT COST WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE MILLION. OF THAT BUILDING. WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE LATE EIGHTIES SEVENTIES EARLY EIGHTIES. IT WAS THAT THE STATE'S OUR FIRST REAL ATTEMPT AT A GREEN BUILDING. AND IT IS HISTORICAL AYE IT. DOES RANK FOURTH OVERALL IN THE WORST BUILDING. THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SECOND PORTFOLIO AND VISITING IN AND IS IN NEED OF SIGNIFICANT RENOVATION. OF THAT WOULD INCLUDE WORK ON ALL MAJOR BUILDING SYSTEMS ADJUSTING FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES INCLUDING FIRE SPRINKLER INSTALLATION. THE THE BUILDING HAS A SIGNIFICANT WATER INTRUSION ISSUES HOUSES MATERIALS. IT IS CERTAIN THE ADA COMPLIANCE. NEEDS A NEW OUR CONTROL LIGHTING SYSTEM SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS LETTER. AND THAT BUILDING WILL ULTIMATELY BE. TENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE NOT GOING IN THE. NEW RESOURCES BUILDING THAT WAS AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. CREDIT COLOR OF A CAMPUS COMPLEX FOR THOSE TWO DEPARTMENTS. AND FINALLY WE HAVE THE RENOVATION THE JUST A HUNDRED BUILDING. WE'RE REQUESTING SIX POINT THREE MILLION IN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR THAT PROJECT TOTAL PROJECT COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE. IT NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE UNDER BUILDING WAS CONSTRUCTED NINETEEN TWENTY NINE IS A HISTORICAL LANDMARK AND AS OUR FIFTH OVERALL WAS BUILDING OUR PORTFOLIO. A IT IS ALSO IN NEED OF COMPREHENSIVE RENOVATIONS AND SIGNIFICANTLY AND NUMBER FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES. INSULATION A FIRE SPRINKLERS. ADDITION OF TWO NEW US FIVE STORY STAIRS FOR EXITING MULTIPLE SMOKE VERY AND FIRE STOPPING EFFICIENCIES REPLACING ALL MAJOR BUILDING SYSTEMS. THE IT ALSO HAS A WATER INTRUSION ISSUE HAS MATA IS NOT YOU COMPLIANCE IT'S EITHER. A ONCE RENOVATED THIS BUILDING WILL HOUSE THE STATE CONTRIBUTED TREASURER'S OFFICE CONSOLIDATED OUR AND WOULD ALSO AVOID WATCHING ONE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE LIKE THE BATES AND BUILDING WOULD. THANK YOU. LL. COMING CRISTINA LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THESE PROPOSALS AYE WITH REGARD TO THE PRINTING PLANT DEMOLITION AND I'M WE DON'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THAT WE DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO DEMOLISH THAT BUILDING. AND GIVEN THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT SITES USED FOR. IT THAT PUBLIC DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THAT EXISTING BUILDING ON THAT SITE. HOWEVER WE ARE RECOMMENDING REJECTING REJECTING. THE FUNDING FOR THE RICHARDS BOULEVARD PROJECT. THAT'S BECAUSE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT PROJECT IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR THE STATE TO MEET ITS BUILDING MEANS. I'M SO SPECIFICALLY WE ESTIMATED THE COST OF THE COSTS OF BUILDING ON AND MAINTAINING AN OPERATING THAT BUILDING AND COMPARED THEM TO THE COSTS. BECAUSE SAVINGS THAT WOULD. RECRUITED THE STATE FROM NOT HAVING TO LEASE. THE EXISTING SPACE THAT THOSE PATENT PERMITS ARE AND. ALLAH WHEN WE COMPARED THOSE AND LOOK AT HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR THIS STATE WITH COULD BREAK EVEN. ON THE WE GOT A NUMBER THAT WAS OVER EIGHTY YEARS AND THAT'S RELATIVELY LONG WE THINK THAT'S LONGER THAN THAT. LIKE WE. WIFE OF THE BUILDING AYE WE WOULD KNOW DID YES HAD A LOWER NUMBER. THEIR FEW DIFFERENCES IN OUR CALCULATIONS. AND WE THINK THAT THAT OUR NUMBERS MORE APPROPRIATE THE COUPLE THE BIGGEST ONES ONE WAS. THAT THEY DIDN'T DISCOUNT OF THE CASH FLOWS AND WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DO DOING KNOWLEDGE THAT MONEY TODAY IS WORTH MORE THAN THAN MONEY IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF INFLATION AND OTHER FACTORS. ALSO THERE SOME OTHER ASSUMPTIONS LIKE OUT WE THOUGHT THAT THE ASSUMES THAT THE. A RATE OF INCREASE IN MANAGEMENT. AND OPERATIONS COSTS WAS TOO LOW THEY ASSUMED OF LESS THAN ONE PERCENT INCREASE YOUR PRE YEAR THERE WAS A POINT FIVE PERCENT SAID WE ADJUSTED THOSE. THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WE GOT OVER EIGHTY YEARS WE THINK THAT THAT. SUGGEST THAT IT'S NOT A VERY A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MEET THE STATE'S BUILDING NEEDS. I'M SO NOTABLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT APPROVE THE FUNDING AND INSTEAD DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME FORWARD WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL. ON THAT COULD BE A DIFFERENT BUILDING ON THE SITE IT COULD BE SELLING THE SITE. ON THERE POTENTIALLY EVEREADY OF OPTIONS AYE WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE SEQUENCING PLAN SO. BOTH THE RICHARDS BOULEVARD PROJECT AS WELL AS THE TWO RENOVATION PROJECT THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT THEY'RE ALL PART. OF THIS SACRAMENTO SERVE STRATEGY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AND. DIRT THAT STRATEGY IS. PRETTY ARE INTERCONNECTED AND LINKED SO MANY CASES OTHER SERVICE SEQUENCE OF RENOVATION YOUR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION PROJECTS. I'M SO WE THINK IT'S WORTH HAVING MORE INFORMATION ON. WHAT ALTERNATIVES MIGHT BE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN SO FOR EXAMPLE HE DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH RICHARD BOULEVARD PROJECT? ON WHAT ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU COULD PURSUE. I'M PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE PARTIES LEGISLATURE HOUSE. AND THEN FINALLY. OVER RECOMMENDING ABOUT IT YES REPORT ON THE RENOVATION PROJECT THAT YOU HEARD THEIR TO PROPOSED RENOVATIONS PROJECTS THAT BATES AND PROJECT. I AND I'M ARE PROJECTS WE DO THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO REPAIR AND RENOVATE THOSE TWO BUILDINGS. ARE THEY BOTH HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS BASIN SOLELY CONDITION ASSESSMENT THAT WERE CONDUCTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THEY WERE BOTH ASSESSED TO BE AN IMPORT CONDITION AND HAVE. I'M SOME SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES SO WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY REASONABLE. BUT TO PURSUE SOME RENOVATIONS OF THOSE PROJECTS. WE DO KNOW THAT WE THINK THAT THE PRESSURE COSTS APPEAR TO BE. UP PRETTY HIGH THEIR HIGHER THAN SOME OF THE PREVIOUS BUILDING HUNDRED HAITIANS THAT THE STATE HAS. HAS ENGAGED IN INCLUDING THE LIBRARIAN COURTS AS WELL AS OFFICE BUILDING EIGHT AND NINE AND THOSE WERE. A COUPLE OF THE MOST RECENT OF A SIGNIFICANT INNOVATONS THE STATE'S UNDERTAKEN. I'M SO I THINK IT'S WORTH HAVING ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE REASONS FOR THE COSTS AS WELL AS. CAN REPORT ON SOME POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE SCOPES THAT MIGHT BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE. FINANCE. SILICON. THE FEDERAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT. PRESENTATION AND FOR THE ANALYSIS I GUESS. IT WILL AND I'D LIKE TO GET A SENSE FOR. IT THE GREAT COUNTY WHERE. DEED YES SEIZE THE STATE GOING IN REGARDS TO BUILDINGS UP AND RENTAL SPACE BECAUSE. BACK. A FEW YEARS AGO THAT I THE. WE HAD SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY WE HAD A REDUCTION OR AN A CONTRACTION OF THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE. WE WERE FILLING VACANCIES AND SO WE HAD A LOT OF BACON STATE SPACE ARE WERE TO PUT IT MORE SPECIFICALLY WEEK WE HAD A LOT OF VACANCIES IN STATE OWNED BUILDINGS AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO GET. THAT DEPARTMENTS ADDED MOVED OUT INTO OUR PRIVATE RENTAL SPACE BACK INTO THE BUILDINGS. BUT THERE WERE ISSUES WITH. ADA COMPLIANCE AND ALL THAT KIND STEP IN SO THERE WAS THIS THIS CHALLENGE BETWEEN. HOW DO WE UTILIZE? OUR OUR SPACE WELL SO SO NUMBER ONE IS THE STATE DID NOT DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF. AT KEEPING UP WITH ME IN ITS AND THAT I THINK YOU FIND THAT OVERALL IS THE CASE IN IN GOVERNMENT IS THAT WHEN TIMES GET TOUGH. WE TRY TO KEEP. EXISTING SERVICES GOING AND SO WE. WE DELETE THAT MAINTENANCE. AND AND SO THEN WHEN WE FINALLY DO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND WE START TO TRY TO FIX THE MAIN AND SENATE'S COST US A LOT MORE IT'S NOT VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND SO. SO. THERE THAT THAT QUESTION BECAME DO WE UPGRADE THE STATE SPACE AND. HAVE STATE DEPARTMENT STAY IN THAT SPACE OR DO WE. CELL. AND LET SOMEONE ELSE WORRY ABOUT THAT UPKEEP AND MAINTENANCE AND. WE RENT AND SO I AM TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF OF WHERE WE'RE GOING AS I LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR ON REQUEST BECAUSE. THE RENOVATIONS ARE EXPENSIVE AND. YEAH BUT BUT THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT STATE BUILDINGS AND AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE WE SHOULD KEEP THEM. IT AND I THINK THE SEQUENCING IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS YOU VACATE. THE BUILDING YOU GOTTA PUT PEOPLE SOMEPLACE AND THEN. HAVE HAVE THEM CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN THEN BRING THEM BACK WITHOUT IT BEING AT THE CHALLENGE AND SO I WAS TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. OF WHAT THE THE SEQUENCE WAS GOING TO BE AROUND THE STATE AND THE. THAT THAT THEIR PRINTING PLANT LOCATION SITES SEEM TO BE PRETTY IMPORTANT TO THAT WHOLE DISCUSSION IN AND OUT. BUT. BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE A. THAT THEIR REQUEST WAS FOR. WORKING DRAWINGS AND I ASSUME THAT WAS IN PREPARATION OF THE BID PROCESS. BUT IT WASN'T REALLY CLEAR TO ME IF THAT IS BECAUSE THE OTHER ONES TALK ABOUT DESIGN BUILD KNOWS THAT THE PREFERRED STRATEGY AND SO IF IT IF YOU COULD JUST I'M NOT. I'M NOT SURE I'VE GOT A SPECIFIC QUESTION OTHER THAN I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THESE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND THE COSTS FOR? RENOVATION DO SEEM VERY HIGH GIVEN THAT THE COURTS WAS WITH IT WAS X. A MEAN THAT REALLY IS A A PRIMO CHAPEL OF OF DOING THE HIGHEST QUALITY I THINK. A RENOVATION THAT YOU CAN GET I THINK IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL COMPARED TO WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE. ON SO COULD IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM SEQUENCING WAITRESS THOUGHT IS. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE ON. UPGRADING OUR OUR ON. OUR OWN EXISTING BUILDINGS AND UTILIZE A MINUTE ASSUMING WHAT WERE THEIR GOAL IS TO UTILIZE OUR OWN. UP RESOURCES AND NOT HAVE TO RENT OUTSIDE OF THE STATE BUT PRINT UNLESS WE REALLY HAVE TO SO I GUESS THAT'S A. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS SURE THAT'S A THAT'S A LOTTA TO BITE OFF I WILL TRY TO BE AND CONCISE. ALSO ULTIMATELY YEAH WE WE HAVE DOING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IS HAVING A LOOK AT ALL THE DEVIOUS OWNED OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF THAT THE STATE. THOSE BUILDINGS WERE THEN RANKED IN TERMS OF. THE SEVERITY OF THE DEFICIENCIES. WE THEN DEVELOPED A SEQUENCING PLAN PRINCIPLES THAT. SO WE WERE LOOKING AT NOT JUST WHICH BUILDINGS ARE WERE THE MOST IN NEED OF SPACE BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO RENOVATE ONE KNOWING THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT ANY LEASABLE SPACE IN SACRAMENTO OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING. IN ADDITION OF THAT YOUR POINT ABOUT SORT OF THE THE THE EXPANDING CONTRACTING NATURE OF OF. THE STATE WORKFORCE ON A LONG ENOUGH TIMELINE IT TENDS TO KEEPING PACE WITH POPULATION GROWTH. AND SO WHAT WE SEE OVER TIME IS THE NEED FOR EVER INCREASING ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE AND YOU SEE THAT I THINK EVEN WITH PHIL LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS. THAT SPURRED ADDITIONAL SPACE REQUESTS INTO THE GOVERNMENT TENDS TO DO THAT. AND SO THIS DO WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPACE AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT WE'RE ESSENTIALLY LANDLOCKED IN SACRAMENTO TO BEGIN WITH IT. INITIATED US INTO BUILDING THE NEW NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY BUILDING IN THE TWIN TURBO THREE BILLION WHICH IS AUTHORIZED AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. THOSE TWO PROJECTS AS THEY ARE BUILT THEN ALLOW US TO MOVE TENANTS FROM DEFICIENT SPACE INTO NEW SPACE. WE ARE AGAIN COME LOOKING AT THE LARGEST SPACE. AS WELL AS WHAT KIND OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES WE CAN GAIN A THROUGH THE PROCESS SO. RIGHT NOW THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY HAS. TO GET A TOTAL OF SEVEN APARTMENTS PLUS THE AGENCY ITSELF A BIG ON THE NATURAL RESOURCES NEW DATA RESOURCES BUILDING. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CONSOLIDATE THE WAY THEY HAD BEEN ABLE CONSULTANT BEFORE. ON THE PROFITING ULTRA BUILDING WILL TAKE THE TENANTS IN THE BATES AND BUILDING AND AND PUT THEM IN NEW SPACE ALLOWING US TO RENOVATE THE BATES AND. SO IT THIS SEQUENCING PLAN ALLOWS US TO CREATE SPACE MOVE PEOPLE INTO THOSE SPACES AND THE RENOVATE BEHIND. ULTIMATELY ARE. TICKETING PLAN PRINCIPLES. DO PREFER TO OWN IN AREAS OF OF. HI LISA ABOUT THAT HIGHWAYS COSTS AND RIGHT NOW IN SACRAMENTO IS PRICKLY THE DOWNTOWN CORE IT IS. VERY EXPENSIVE TO LEASE SPACE. SO THE THE GOAL IS OLD LIVING FROM INTEREST IN PERSPECTIVE TO. CONTINUE THIS. PROCESS OF UPDATING ARE DEFICIENT SPACE I'M RICHARDS BOULEVARDS USE YOUR POINT ABOUT THE WORKING DRAWINGS RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE THE STATE. PRINT PLANT THAT'S ON THAT SITE. THE WORKING DRAWINGS REQUEST IS RELATED TO THE DEMOLITION OF THAT PROJECT ONCE WE DEMOLISH THAT PROJECT IT AVOIDS HAVING TO PAY ONE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO CHEAT UP FOR DEVELOPMENT OR TALENT OR WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS. HOWEVER OUR PLANET PRESENT IS TO WITH RICHARD BELOW PROJECT TO BUILD A NEW CAMPUS COMPLEX ON THAT SITE. DOING THAT WILL ALLOW US TO RENOVATE FOR FIFTY AND STREET WHICH IS THE BILL. BUILDING. AND THEN ALLOW TO CONSOLIDATE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY INTO THAT NOT BUILDING. SO WE HAVE THIS THAT THE TENURE SEQUENCING PLAN IS A YOU KNOW COMPREHENSIVE COULD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITIZES. RENOVATION NEW CONSTRUCTION TO ENABLE US TO RENOVATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. IF WE WERE TO TAKE SAY THE. THE THE THREE HUNDRED AND I ALSO HAVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET THAT'S IN THE BATES AND BUILDING THERE'S NOT THAT KIND SPACE IN SACRAMENTO WOULD BE DIVIDED THE DEPARTMENT UP INTO FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT LEASES THROUGHOUT THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA. SO WEAK INCOME HOW TO BE SINGLE IT'S THE WAY IT IS. AND WE'VE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF VARIABLES YOU HAVE THE. THE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES YOU HAVE THE. EXISTING SQUARE FOOTAGE IN BUILDINGS YOU HAVE. THAT THE LEASE SPACE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN LEASES EXPIRE WHO MY CONSOLIDATORS UP THERE'S A DOZEN OR SO VARIABLES THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THE KIND OF CRAFT THE PLANE AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND YOUR QUESTION THAT LISA HIGH LEVEL YES I THINK THAT I GUESS THAT THE PRINCIPLES AYE AND MONEY HERE IS ONE THAT THAT WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE ARTS OUR OWN. STATE OWNS YES THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS I TO BE IN STATE ON SPACE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THAT THE EXISTING. OUR. ARE ADEQUATE TO DO A REORGANIZATION. IT AS YOU GO THROUGH AND RENOVATE. THAT THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING THE X. AT INCREASE POTENTIAL INCREASE IN. IN THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS BASED ON POPULATION BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN A GOOD MEASURE OF. OF. OF GROWTH AND THAT FOR THAT ULTIMATELY THE. THIS SPACE THAT'S CREATED HOPEFULLY IS GOING TO BE OUT DESIGNED ACCORDING TO NEW STANDARDS. IN TERMS OF HOW WORK SPACES DESIGN BUT ALSO WITH COST EFFICIENCIES IN MIND THAT WHERE. THAT WHAT WE END UP FIXING OR DEVELOPING IS NOT GOING TO BE. SO MUCH OVER THE MARKET THAT IT DOESN'T IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE SENSE TO DO IT BUT WE JUST DECIDED WE NEED TO IT ANYWAY SO THAT I GUESS IT THAT THE. PEOPLE YOU IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE YOU WERE. AT PRETTY MUCH STATING THAT AND THAT'S. KIND OF WHAT I WHAT THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK I WANTED TO HEAR SO PERFECT. I PICKED PRESHEAF THAT THING SURE IT WILL STILL GET THE NUMBER OF LEASES WE HAVE DOWNTOWN AND THEN THAT A DOLLAR AMOUNT. LA I TUCK MY HEAD I KNOW HOW MANY. WE HAVE ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. I HAVE TO COME BACK WITH THE INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE CURIOUS WHAT THAT IS AND WITH LONG TERM PLANS ARE FOR THOSE WHO. AND THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST FOR DOWN THE ROAD SURE YEAH WE CAN WE CAN OFFICE PROCEEDINGS BUT YEAH THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU. OPEN UP TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT IN WHICH IS BECAUSE ITEM I WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. A RECOMMENDATION ALL THIS ITEM OPEN SLOWLY OPEN. NEXT ON THE SHE NUMBER TWO. IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT FACILITY DEVELOPMENT. AFTERNOON CHAIR COOPER. ASSEMBLY WOMAN CABALLERO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME INTEREST APPLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR FURNITURE SERVICES THE TGS. FOR ITEM TO EVE YES SEE THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF FIFTEEN POINT SIX MILLION AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. POINT NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR AND ONE PERMANENT POSITION TO CONTINUE THE INSTALLATION OF PBS. FACILITIES AND STATE FACILITIES OF THAT AMOUNT SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AS WELL SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION FROM THE SERVICE REVOLVING FUND THE FUNDING WAS A POOR PERFORMING APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN HUNDRED ASSESSMENTS INSTALLING TWELVE HUNDRED CHARTERS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT ACTION PLAN AND MORE RECENT EXPANDED THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES DDS OVERSEE PLANS TO MAKE ANY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE AND WORKPLACE PARKING SPACES AT STATE FACILITIES. WITH ME IS NANCY AND OUR DEPUTY RECTOR SUSTAINABILITY WHO'S HERE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. LL. I SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER CONSIDER POTENTIAL USING OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDING POTENTIALLY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND OR THEY'LL TURN EVAN RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FUNDS. I'M IN ORDER TO. FACILITATE THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION OF THOSE FUNDING SOURCES RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT ADMINISTRATION AND TO REPORT ON. Y.. WHY DIDN'T USE THOSE SOURCES AND WHETHER THOSE SOURCES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE? WE WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR COUPLE REASONS FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION FIRST. SO THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR WE'VE HAD FUNDING FOR BASICALLY THIS. GENERAL PURPOSE IN LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND ALSO. WE EXPECT THAT THEY'LL BE FUTURE PROPOSALS. IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THAT GOALS ARE REALLY. MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN WE'RE GONNA REACH THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF BOTH WE. A SEVEN PRODUCTION AS WELL AS WORKPLACE STATIONS FOR OR I STAFF THAT WORK FOR THE STATE. SO IN TOTAL WE EXPECT THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD. LIKELY EXCEED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS SO THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL COSTS. WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR SEVEN PRODUCTION OR IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. OTHER GOVERNORS KEVIN TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN ALLOCATES ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN DISCRETIONARY AND YOUR F. REVENUE. HOWEVER VERY SICK ACTIVITIES INCLUDING INCENTIVIZING THE PRIVATE PURCHASE OF ZEV VEHICLES. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE SPENDING PLAN INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE OTHER FUND THEY MENTION THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL. AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FUND AS WELL AS A FEW OTHER FUNDS ARE TO SUPPORT PRIVATE AYE CHARGING STATIONS SO WE THINK IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING THIS FUNDING SOURCES FOR THESE PUBLIC STATIONS AS WELL. I WE WOULD KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION DOES HAVE SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD. DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO SEEK OTHER FUNDING SOURCES BUT THE SPAWNING SOURCES THAT WE. ARE MENTIONED THERE WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE LIKELY THE LEGISLATURE MADE A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION WITHIN THE BUDGET. TAKE THAT THANK YOU FINANCE. FOR DID YES OUT OF THE DIGEST PLAN TO BUILD OUT THE EVE VESSEY WHATEVER IT IS INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION HOW DO YOU PLAN TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WHAT'S THE PLAN. I'M WELL THE STEPS ARE TO FIRST OF ALL TO GO OUT TO THE ACTUAL SITES PHYSICALLY AND DO AN ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF PLACEMENT BASED ON. A LOCATION BASED ON COST OF TRENCHING DISTANCE TO THE FACILITIES THAT CEDRAS SO ONCE WE DO AN ASSESSMENT. THEN WE CAN DETERMINE HOW MANY WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE EACH SITE. BUT THE PLAN IS TO FOCUS ON THE FLEET FIRST SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FLEET VEHICLES THAT AT THIS POINT. DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE A INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CHARGING AND SO OUR PRIORITY IS TO PRIORITIZE THOSE FIRST AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE WORKPLACE CHARGING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE FACILITIES WOULD ALSO BE. TAKEN CARE OF AT THE SAME TIME FOR ECONOMIC REASONS WILL EVERY STATE BUILDING GET THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT NECESSARILY SO AGAIN AT FIRST IT WILL BE FLEET AS A PRIORITY AND NOT EVERY EVERY STATE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT HAS FLEET ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR FACILITIES OF THOSE WOULD BE THE FIRST PRIORITY. ON SECOND PRIORITY WILL BE WHERE THERE IS A NEED FOR WORKPLACE CHARGING SO AGAIN WITH THEIRS ONE OR TWO PARKING SPOTS IS TYPICALLY WOULD NOT BE ECONOMICAL TO GRASP IT OF ITS A LARGE FACILITY WITH A LOT OF WORKPLACE NEEDS THAN THOSE WOULD BE A PRIORITY. AS A SECOND PRIORITY AND WHAT IS PROJECTED COST TO SUPPORT ESCALATION OF ADDITIONAL FACILITIES. AND WE'RE STILL WERE WERE NAY ALL IN OUR SECOND YEAR HONOR SORRY FIRST YEAR THIS IS THIS REQUEST IS FOR THE SECOND YEARS SO. WE'RE STILL YEAH I GETTING STABLE AS FAR AS ACTUAL COSTS BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S COSTING APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARGING. SPOT TO INSTALL AND THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE DESIGN AS WELL AS THE INSTALLATION. A QUESTIONS FROM THE. QUESTION BUT IT WAS GOV HERE YEAH I JUST GOT TO SAY THAT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT. IBM. THE CHARGING STATION ISLAM IS WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU START FIGURING IT INTO THE PRICE A VEHICLE THAT THAT'S. IT JUST IT'S VERY HIGH BUT BUT MY QUESTION. IS. AS I WAS READING THIS. I THOUGHT THAT THAT. THE REPORT AND THE THE ANALYSIS THAT ALREADY BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF OF THE LOCATIONS AND. WHERE SOME OF THE FACILITIES MICO YOU HAVE A MAP THAT WOULD SHOW US WHERE THESE WOULD BE DEPLOYED STATEWIDE? SO THAT THE PROCESS WE WENT THROUGH AS WE DID A SURVEY WE SURVEYED BASICALLY ALL OF THE STATE AGENCIES TO ASK THEM EXACTLY HOW MANY SPOTS THEY HAVE EXACTLY HOW MANY FLEET THEY. CURRENTLY HAVE STRANDED HOW MANY FLEET THEY HAVE FOR. INTENTIONS TO PURCHASE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AND SO WE GOT WE GATHERED ALL OF THAT DATA AND SO OUR PLAN IS BASED ON THAT DATA. AS WE'RE GOING OUT EACH OF THE SITES WERE FINDING A LOT OF INACCURACIES IN THE DATA SO WE'RE HAVING TO READJUST BASED ON WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEN OUT IN THE FIELD. I DO HAVE A LIST WITH ME OF THE LOCATIONS THAT WE STARTED WITH THIS YEAR SO I CAN SHARE THAT WITH YOU. IT'S ANALYST'S FORM NOT IN A MAP BUT I CAN CERTAINLY PUT IT ON A MAP FOR YOU IF THAT'S THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK FOR FOR FOR FUTURE REFERENCE JUST TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THE WET. WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE SHARE MY GUESS ISMOST OF THESE. FACILITIES WILL BE IN URBAN CENTERS BECAUSE THAT THOSE ARE WHERE THE SHORTER THAT'S CORRECT SIR ARE MADE. AND SO THAT WOULD BE REAL HOPE FOR FULL FOR MOST OF US OF I'M A WANNA BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT ENDING UP PURCHASING VEHICLES THAT THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE UTILIZED BECAUSE IT'S NOT. EITHER AND EFFICIENT TO CHARGE OVER THERE NOT GETTING CHARGED THE E. EIGHTY FIVE EXPERIENCES THAT. WE PURCHASED VERY AB CARS VEHICLES THAT WERE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEN. A. DUAL USE E. EIGHTY FIVE WITH WITH THAT REGULAR FUEL. AND IT COST US MORE BUT. STAFF DID NOT USE THE E. EIGHTY FIVE BECAUSE IT WAS AN INCONVENIENT TO GO OUT. TO THE SITES WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY PURCHASE THAT PRODUCT AND SO. IN RURAL AREAS TO BUY AN E. EIGHTY FIVE VEHICLE WAS A REAL WASTE OF MONEY. AND I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS ALL WORKS OUT IN AND AND MAKE THE COMMITMENT TO ACTUALLY USING THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IN IN THE REGIONS WHERE IT. POSSIBLE TO DO IT YEAH GET YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN WERE ABSOLUTELY SENSITIVE TO IT WE ARE DEFINITELY PRIORITIZING WHERE THERE'S THE GREATEST USAGE PATTERNS THAT WE'RE SEEING. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION THOUGH IS THAT IT'S AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO LEVERAGE A LOT OF UTILITY FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO OFFSET. THE STATE COSTS FOR THESE. INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLMENTS AND IN PARTICULAR WITH P. JEANNIE RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM IN THEIR THAT THEY. THE PROGRAM THEY ARE JUST INITIATING ON LAUNCHING THIS YEAR WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE US OUT THE COSTS ENABLE US TO INSTALL MORE THAN WE. WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. SO ARE THE COSTS SO HIGH AND CONNECTIONS GOV YEARS EARLIER QUESTION BECAUSE HAVE YOU WRITTEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT I DON'T RECALLS BEING THAT HIGH. WHO INSTALLED ARE THE CHARGING STATIONS FRANKLY AS YOU INSTALL MORE EACH LOCATION THOSE COSTS DOES DIP DOWN THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE BECAUSE MUCH LOWER THAN THAT IT'S JUST THAT? AT EACH LOCATION THERE'S NOT CONSISTENTLY TWENTY SPOTS SIR YOU KNOW THIRTY SPOTS SOME OF THEM HAVE THREE OR FOUR BUT THEY STILL HAVE A VERY STRONG NEED BECAUSE THEY HAVE STRANDED FLEET VEHICLES SO WE. ON THOSE SITUATIONS COSTS ARE HIGHER AND ON THE SITUATIONS WHERE WE HAVE MORE EACH SITE THE COSTS ARE MUCH LOWER THEIR AVERAGE YOU YOU PROJECT REACH FACILITY I MEAN FOR FIVE OR. THERE ARE DIFFERENT I THINK AT CDC ARE THEY HAVE LARGE NUMBERS AND AND THERE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE. DMV'S SAME THING C. H. P. THOSE ARE DEPARTMENTS WHERE WORK AND HAVE. A LARGE NUMBER OF INSTALLATIONS AND BE ABLE TO KEEP COSTS REALLY LOW PER INSTALLATION. OTHER PLACES. DEPARTMENT OF REHAB OR FISH AND WILDLIFE WHERE THERE'S A SMALLER NUMBER THAN THE COST WILL BE HIGHER. GOING UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT ANY WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. A GLENN CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE LIST OF OPEN. SO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM SHE NEVER THREE. LEGISLATION. SHARE COOPER. WE HAVE. THREE REQUESTS TITLE LEGISLATION FLASHERS GOVERNOR. THE FIRST IS ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT TWO TWO AUTHORED BY SOMEONE CABALLERO THIS MEASURE CREATE A FIVE PERCENT BID PREFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIA GROWN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. DO YOU DDS IS REQUESTING THREE UNDERNEATH THOUSAND SERVICE REVOLVING FUND INTO PERMANENT POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF AB EIGHT TO TWO. THE MY YOU KNOW MY OFFICE KEEP OF OTHER ALL THREE OF THEM WITH ELECTIONS ON THE BULK SECOND MEASURES SP SIX OH FIVE BUT CENTER GALGIANI THIS MEASURE CREATES A NEW SMALL BUSINESS CERTIFICATION SPECIFICALLY FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. DS IS REQUESTING THREE AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND IN S. R. F. AUTHORITY AND NOT TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TO OWNERS OF THE FOUR THOUSAND AND TWENTY IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY. A AND ON GOING FIRST. THE START UP COSTS THE PROGRAM INTO PERMANENT POSITIONS TO DEVELOP ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. THE THIRD IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SIX TWO BY MISTER BONTA THIS MEASURE REQUIRES DDS TO ESTABLISH THE MAXIMUM ACCEPTABLE BLOOMING GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL FOR FOUR CATEGORIES OF BUILDING MATERIALS BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN. MEASURE THAT PROHIBITS BUILDING MATERIALS THAT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM ACCEPTABLE AVERAGE FROM BEING USED IN STATE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS THIS INCLUDES UC AND CSU PROJECTS AS WELL. DDS IS REQUESTING SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND SERVICE REVOLVING FUND FUNDING FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONGOING. INCLUDING ONE PERMANENT POSITION TO ESTABLISH THE THRESHOLD TO MANAGE ITS NEW PROGRAM. A AND THAT TODAY I AM HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THESE. LL. NO CONCERNS FINANCE. YOU WISH TO SPEAK FOR THE PUBLIC. A CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. FOR DVS WAS THE PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE STATE CONTRACT MANY OF PURSUANT AB TWO SIX TWO. YES I THINK THE QUESTION ROLES AROUND THE THE ONE TIME FUNDING REQUESTS. OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THAT FIRST YEAR AND IT'S. YOU HAD LESS TO DO WITH THE COSTS ASSOCIATED UPDATING US A CONTRACT EMMANUEL AND MORE WITH THE NEWNESS OF THIS PROGRAM SO. THE BILL REQUIRES US TO LOOK AT SOMETHING CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION WHICH COMPANIES GONE CONTRACT FOR TO ASSESS A THESE MATERIALS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON. WHEN THEY'RE BEING PRODUCED I'D HAVE RELATIVELY NEW INDUSTRY AND THERE'S NO SINGLE CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THESE WHEN THEY'RE DEVELOPED SO THERE'S A LOT OF ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND EXPERTISE THAT'S KIND OF OUTSIDE OF AND ANYONE IN THE STATE ROOM. AT THIS POINT SO THAT DOLLARS REQUESTING THE FIRST YEARS A CONTRACT OUT FOR THE SERVICES AND EXPERTISE WE NEED TO GATHER ALL THE INFORMATION AND DATA SO THAT WE CAN SEND APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD. OKAY. RECOGNITION SOLIS ITEM OPEN SLOWLY OPENED. NEXT ITEM MUSICIAN EVER FOR MERCURY CLEANERS SITE MONITOR. SO IF YOU FOR DTS IS REQUESTING AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND TO CONTINUE WITH SITE MONITORING AT THE MERCURY A CLEANER SITE. OVER LAST YEAR WE'VE WORKED ON EXTENSIVE REMEDIATION EFFORT SITE. A PRELIMINARY. REMEDIATION IS NOW COMPLETE OR MORE OF ME INTO A PHASE OF SITE MONITORING TO ENSURE THAT THAT ARE WITH THOSE REMEDIATION EFFORTS WERE INDEED SUCCESSFUL. THIS REQUEST IS CONTINUE THE SITE MONITORING ACTIVITIES THROUGH GENERAL FUND FOR THE CURRENT AND FUTURE FISCAL YEARS ST MUTTERING WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO OCCUR. AS REQUIRED BY THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD AND WITH ME THAT I HAVE. JIM MARTIN HIS OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BRANCH CHIEF WHO'S AVAILABLE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM OKAY LL NOT CONCERNS FINANCE. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS I THINK WE TOUR TWO YEARS AGO THAT'S CORRECT WHEN THE PAST MACLEAR SITE MONITORING BCP. WAS BLOCKED THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WITH REQUESTS FOR ONGOING FUNDING. THIS ESTIMATE. MISSUS MADE THE NEED FOR ANY REQUEST AND UPDATES ON SITE MONITORING. THAT'S THIS THIS REQUEST IS JUST FOR ONGOING MONITORING FOR THE FORTY FOUR WELLS AND. FOR. ANY REMEDIATION THAT MAY COME STILL NEEDED BASED OFF A CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD. SO SALUTE DOES ELIMINATE MAYBE NEED FOR AND THE REQUESTED UPDATES ON SITE MONITORING. THE THERE WILL BE CONTINUING NEEDS FOR. SITE MONITORING PROBABLY FOR QUITE SOMETIME DEPENDING ON WHAT THE WATER BOARD SENDS. DO S. PLAN TO BUILD ONE SLIGHTLY FUTURE IT'LL ORDER. UP. BATES STOP CONVERSATIONS WITH. THIS SUMMER WITH THE WATER BOTTLE CAN HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR WHAT. THAT LEVEL OF THE REMEDIATION HAS SPENT YOU NOW THERE'S THERE'S NOT THEN SPECIFIC RIGHT NOW BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SURROUNDING AREAS YOU KNOW WE WOULD MIGHT WORK WITH KEETA. BUT THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVEN'T. PER BEEN PURSUING. PURSUED BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE REMEDIATION WILL LOOK LIKE. BUT YOU'RE JUST PAID ANSWERED BY THE SUMMER AND SUMMERS GAS WHERE WERE WE PLAN ON MEETING WITH THE WATER BOARD THIS JULY AND. YOU KNOW BASED OFF A YEAR FROM WHEN WE DID THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE HEATING TRAINING. HEAT RESISTANCE REMEDIATION AND UP GIVE US ABOUT A YEAR. TO ANALYZE THE DATA AND AND ALL WILL WILL SEE WORK ON WHERE WE STAND. JET LOOK FOR THE HEARING WHICH YOUR FINDINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY AVOID OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT. CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT THE SADDAM'S COULD BE HELD OPEN SO THANK YOU. NEXT ITEM SHE NEVER FIVE. MODIFICATION OF FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR THE CONTRACTED FISCAL SERVICES. GET YOUR COOPER. ON THIS ITEM DID YES REQUESTING OVERALL BUDGET AUGMENTATION OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION BEGINNING IN THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO FULLY RECOVER COSTS AND PROVIDE FISCAL SERVICES TO DEPARTMENT CLIENTS. ADDITIONAL DTS IS REQUESTING TWO THINGS THIS PIECE PETER FIRST THE MODIFICATION OF THE FUNDING STRUCTURE PROGRAM WHICH RESULT ABOUT A THREE MILLION PRODUCTION SERVICE REVOLVING FUND AUTHORITY AN INCREASE OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY. AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE MILLION INSERT A CENTRAL SERVICES COST RECOVERY FUND. STAFF REPORT PRETTY CLEARLY LAYS OUT THE DYNAMICS OF FUNDING MODIFICATIONS AND. DDS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE AGREE ON THE WORKLOAD NEEDS THE BUSINESS UNIT THE TOTAL COSTS. OIL. NEW CONCERNS FINANCE. HOW THE PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS AFFECT THE AGENCIES? SO I'M HAPPY TAKE THIS QUESTION LET'S FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO. JOHN FITZPATRICK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS. THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE IT TOO EASY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON THE VARIOUS ENTITIES SO THAT WHEN THE COSTS. FOR CFS ACTIVITIES CHANGE A YEAR OVER YEAR. IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY IMPACT YOUR BUDGETS THE FUNDING TO PAY FOR THESE ACTIVITIES WILL COME DIRECTLY FROM THE FUNDS THROUGH THE PRO RATA. PRO RATA PROCESS. WILL COST INCREASE OR DECREASE USING THESE METHODS. HE'S. SETTING IT UP THIS WAY WON'T IMPACT THE COSTS IT'S. MECHANISM FOR PAYING FOR THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH DOING THE. BUDGETING ACCOUNTING SERVICES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS SOURCE COST NEUTRAL. CORRECT. THE PRO RATA THAT THIS SHIFT TO USING PRO RATA IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT A EACH AFFECTING THE COST WOULD BE JUST DOESN'T ANNUAL BASIS AS WE DETERMINE OUR COST RECOVER.
