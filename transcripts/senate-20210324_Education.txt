SEEING NONE YES GO AHEAD SENATOR DOLLY I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT- SO I LOOK THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT. IF STUDENT AT IS SOMETHING VERY HARD TO PAY BACK BUT YOU ALSO RECEIVE EDUCATION. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE AT HIGHER ED GET USUALLY TYPICALLY PAY MORE WE'VE SEEN ALL THE STATISTICS OF THAT. THEY DID THE DAY- SO WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS MONEY THAT HAS BEEN LOANED OUT AND THAT THE PEOPLE THAT PAY ARE US. AND PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE THE END UP PAYING THAT BILL FOR THOSE REASONS I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS PIECE OF THIS SJR THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING SENATE- BY SURE RESIDENCIA A BOOK OR TROUBLED. SO IN CONTEXT- MY PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS AND LOW INCOME. I THEY DID NOT HAVE THE FULL ABILITY TO. HELP VERY MUCH WITH MY COLLEGE TUITION. I ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH GRANTS AND SCHOLARSHIPS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PAY IN A WORK THROUGH COLLEGE. I HAD DEBT. WHEN I FINISHED SCHOOL. AND WORK TOWARDS FINISHING IN PAYING THAT DEBT OUT. AND IT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I. DID NOT HARDIS VERY MUCH FINANCIAL LITERACY HAD THE BASICS BUT I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND- REALLY HAVE THAT FINANCIAL LITERACY THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN MARIN POWERING ON ON MY END. AND THIS BRINGS EIGHTY I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL OR THIS RESOLUTION THIS THIS LETTER THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEND TO THE- TO THE PRESIDENT. AND THEN MAYBE. SORT OF START THINKING ABOUT CERTAIN QUESTIONS AND ONE. THE COST OF SCHOOLING OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN IN IN OUR NATION IN CALIFORNIA EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE WHICH GOES ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A VERY HIGH COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AND THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN FOR ME. ON ON MANY LEVELS AS TO WHAT CAUSES THE RISE IN THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA- IN THAT- AND ALSO. WITH THE COST OF LIVING CALIFORNIA BEING SOME EXTREMELY HIGH. THE RAMIFICATION EFFECTS OF THAT IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE THEY NEED A SAFETY NET AND SO THEY LOOK AT GOVERNMENT IF THAT THE KEY LOCAL COMMUNITIES FAMILIES CAN MEET THOSE NEEDS TO LOOK AT GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. AND AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT LOOKS TO US TO TAXPAYERS WHICH WE ARE ALL TAXPAYERS AND- IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WEEK SOME OF US BE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN OTHERS BUT EVERYBODY PAYS INTO. THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO PAY. FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT IS USING TO YOU TO PAY FOR THESE FOR THESE ISSUES SO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE'RE ALL STILL PAYING FOR- WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS BASICALLY HELPING PEOPLE OUT WITH. SO MAYBE THINK ABOUT THAT IT ALSO MADE ME THINK ABOUT- AB. ALL THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW TO HELP OUR STUDENTS SO IN EDUCATION AND BUDGET WE'VE BEEN APPROVING A LOT OF FINANCIAL HELP. WITH GRANTS AND THE ABILITY TO. HELP STUDENTS OUT FINANCIALLY TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SCHOOL SO THERE'S A LOT OF HELP ALREADY IN PLACE. FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T MEET THEIR NEEDS. SO I I'M A LITTLE HESITANT- ON THIS ENDEAVOR JUST BECAUSE- WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE A LOT OF SAFETY NETS FOR STUDENTS AND THAT'S NOT SAYING THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGHIT MADE IT COULD NOT ALWAYS BE ENOUGH- BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS. GONE THROUGH THE SAMETHING OF GOING TO SCHOOL NOT HAVING A LOT OF MONEY I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE ON RAW MAN. AND YOU KNOW FROZEN VEGETABLES- TO MAKE IT TO THE TO THE END OF THE WEEK OUR TO THE OF THE MONTH. I COMPLETELY GET THIS BUT WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN PLACE TO HELP OUR STUDENTS. AND WE'VE BEEN APPROVING THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE BEEN APPROVING A LOT AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN IN PLACE A LOT OF EFFORTS IN ORDER TO DO THAT. BUT AT THE END OF THE LINE AT THE END OF THE OF THE OF THE OF THE CONSIDERATION THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS REVIEWING THIS WAS THE FACT THAT. WE ARE ALL STILL GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THIS. CONTINUES TO ADAM TO OUR BOTH OUR- OUR FEDERAL DEBT. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY OUR KIDS. THE STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT- THEIR KIDS KIDS WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT. AND I'M NOT SURE WITH THE TOTAL THAT IS RIGHT NOW AT THE- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT- I'M THINKING. CAN WE TRULY A FOR THIS RIGHT NOW IS THE WISEST PLACE. WHERE CAN WE FIND OTHER WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE- AS FAR AS- MAYBE. LOOKING AT THE COST OF SCHOOLING- AND THEN. RE EVALUATING- WHAT IS IT HOW MUCH IS IT THAT WE HAVE TO- EXPECT FROM OUR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR AND- BUT IT'S A TEAM EFFORT. SO FOR THOSE VARIOUS REASONS AND SO FORTH JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE REYES WE'RE- WE'RE WE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STAT. IT'S BEEN PAID OUT. WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND- AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY PAID DIRECTLY. INDIRECTLY THEY'LL STILL HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT- AND WITH INTEREST AT AMUCH HIGHER LAYER AT. AT AND FURTHER. DOWN THE LINE- IMPACTS SO. FOR THOSE REASONS- I. E. I RESPECT. YOUR INTENT. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS OVERALL IN THE LONG TERM. IS SOLVING THE ATTIC THE CRISIS- OR THE- THE FINANCIAL- IMPACT THIS HAS. ON OUR STUDENTS SO. I WILL RESPECTFULLY NOT SUPPORT THIS AT THE MOMENT- BUT I DO. RESPECT YOUR INTENDED TRYING TO HELP OUR STUDENTS- IN MY OF TODAY'S- ECON. AND THE- OF LIVING CAL. THANK YOU FOR- ANYONE ELSE. BEFORE ELSE THE CLOSE CENTER AND ONE I WOULD JUST SAY- YOU NORTH DE IS HIGH. BUT I WOULD I LOVE SEE US SOMETHING THAT CAUSES OUR DEBT GO UP HELP. STUDENTS THAT HELPS ORDINARY WORKING FOLKS FOR SO MANY YEARS WE HAVE INCREASED OUR FEDERAL DEBT BY GIVING TAX BREAKS TO MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES WHAT'S UP THE WORKING CLASS SO ON I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE PLEASE CLOSE. I BY BEVERAGE IT DOES COME AS MANAGER AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT THAT- ALL THE WONDERFUL SUPPORTS THAT I VERY MUCH SUPPORT CENTER- WHAT WILL HELP THE NEXT GENERATION OF STUDENTS COMING THROUGH BUT THERE IS A WHOLE. GROUP OF COHORT STUDENTS THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ADVANTAGES OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE. THAT ARE REALLY BEING IMPACTED WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY WHEN THEY'RE UNABLE TO. HAVE ENOUGH YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD SAVINGS TO PULL TOGETHER A DOWN PAYMENT- TO BE ABLE TO START A BUSINESS AND- SO. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE. HI OF COURSE IT IS JUST A RESOLUTION IT'S ONLY URGING- WE APPROVE FEDERAL ACTION- BUT IT DOES PUT US ON RECORD IN SUPPORT OF. OF A SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS. THIS LOAN BIRD AND THAT IS THAT IS JUST. ENORMOUS AND AUNTS AND STIFLING. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU CENTER OUR MEMBERS TO HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOU THE REMOTE OUR MOTION FOR MADE BY SENATOR GLAZERS. MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE NUMBER ONE S. J. R. ONE.

BUT BILLS OUT FORTY TO FIFTY MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALAN MEMBERS WERE GONNA NOW MOVED TO CENTER GLAZER SAID REPLACING YOU JUST PERCENT FROM YOUR SEAT TODAY THANK YOU. CENTER GLAZER HAS SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BUT TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE WHICH AIMS TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES FOR STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THE BILL'S FOLK. IS DOING ACT FOR ALL STUDENTS. SINCE FIRST PUT INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM HAS SERVED ALMOST NINETEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. AT PARTICIPATING CSU'S. THE STUDENTS RECEIVE PRIORITY REGISTRATION AND ADVANCED ADVISING TOOLS NEEDED TO HELP STUDENTS GRADUATING EITHER FOUR YEARS. OR FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERS IN TWO YEARS. FOR THE TWO THIRDS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROGRAM. ARE PELL RECIPIENTS ACCORDING TO DATA PROVIDED BY THE CSU. AND ABOUT HALF OF THOSE WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. HISTORICALLY HOWEVER THE CSU HAS STRUGGLED TO CLOSE STUBBORN EQUITY GAPS BETWEEN STUDENTS OF COLOR AND WHITE STUDENTS. CURRENTLY THE CSU FOR YOUR GRADUATION GAP BETWEEN FRESHMEN STUDENTS WHO IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN OR LATINO AND THEIR WHITE PEERS IS AT TEN POINT FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE NINE POINT 2% FOR YOUR GRADUATION GAPS BETWEEN TELL RECIPIENTS AND THOSE WHO DID NOT RECEIVE PELL GRANTS. IMPROVING EDUCATION OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS IS ESSENTIAL TO GENERATE UPWARD ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND ENSURE A PROSPEROUS STATE. THIS BILL WILL TARGET THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM TO LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. PUTTING THOSE STUDENTS ON A PATH TO GRADUATING WITHIN FOUR YEARS. WITH ME TODAY TO DISCUSS THE BILL IS HE PETRON A CALIFORNIA PROMISE STUDENT FROM CSU SACRAMENTO THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GLAZERS WE WILL NOW GO TO LEAD SUPPORT. IF MADAME MODERATOR OF HEAP TRAN IS ON PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS AND ELLA COMMITTEE. I CALLED TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF S. B. SEVEN EIGHT FIVE. I'M CURRENTLY A STUDENT AT SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY GRADUATING WITH A BA IN HISTORY. I'LL BE GRADUATING THIS MAY. I AM ONE OF THOSE LUCKY. UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WHO BE ABLE TO STATE I GRADUATED WITHIN FOUR YEARS I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS UP THE HELP OF THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED ME WITH THE PANTS DEVISING AND PRIORITY REGISTRATION. THE FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE PROGRAM AFTER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM SOCCER STATE UNIVERSITY STATING I WAS CALLED BY THE JOINT CAL PROMISED. SOMEONE WHO TOOK THE CAL PROMISE PLEDGE MY FIRST SEMESTER BACK IN FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN- SENTENCING DIFFICULTY. NAVIGATING COLLEGE LIFE. LIKE MANY CALL STUDENTS ALSO ME WORKING A FULL TIME JOB ADDITION TO BEING A FULL TIME STUDENT. HAVING AN ADVISER HELPED GUIDE ME THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROGRAM WAS CRUCIAL IN GETTING ME TO WHERE I AM TODAY WELL NOW WE GRADUATING WITH THE SAME COLOR. MY FRESHMAN YEAR. I RECALL AFTER HAVING ONE OF MY BUSIEST MOST DIFFICULT MONSTERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT MY GENERAL VISOR RECOMMENDED TO LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING ON TRACK TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS BUT DRASTICALLY REDUCE MY WORKLOAD. I WAS JUST LAST FALL THEY SPOKE TO GRADUATION VISOR. WHEN FOR DEEP INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THE PARTY COURSE CREDIT. SO I COULD MAKE THOSE MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS. GAIN WORK EXPERIENCE RELATIVE MY CAREER GOALS AND STILL GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS. AND IT'S NOT JUST ADVISING CAL PROMISED RIDES. ALSO GIVEN EXTENSIVE DEGREE ROADMAP TO KEEP ME ON TRACK AND ORGANIZE. IT PROVIDED ITS PRIORITY REGISTRATION. A NECESSITY TO NUMBER AND TACTIC COURSES OFFERED. CAL PROMISE PROGRAMS SAVE ME FROM TAKING ADDITIONAL SEMESTERS TO GET MY DEGREE. GOING INTO FINANCIAL DEBT. THE HARSH REALITIES THAT MANY STUDENTS ARE UNAWARE OF THIS PROGRAM EVEN EXISTS ON CAMPUSES. THE LACK OF OUTREACH AND ACCESSIBILITY HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH AN IMPACTFUL PROGRAM. FOR STUDENTS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. I ASK YOU ALL HERE TODAY TO VOTE I ON SB SEVEN EIGHT FIVE IN ORDER TO HELP MORESTUDENTS LIKE ME SUCCEED IN THEIR COLLEGE CAREERS. THANK YOU.

FREE ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS FOR US SO TO GET CLEAR ON THIS IT. HELPED A LOT AND PROBABLY SAVE SOMETIME TODAY- THE QUESTION I HAVE A LIKE- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO THE DOCTOR CAN I HELP- IT IN I KNOW YOU'RE QUITE AWARE THIS- SOUNDS A STATE UNIVERSITY IS. IS ONE OF THE- BIG CHAMPIONS OF WHAT THEY CALL SPARTAN PROMISE- THIS PROGRAM BASICALLY. IT'S AUGMENTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY. WHAT HAS BEEN AT LEAST UP TO MILITARY WEALTHY COUNTIES COUNTY SANTA CLARA YOU KNOW REALLY PROVIDING THEM. GRANTS YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE MID TO HIGH SIX FIGURE LEVEL- JUST SOUTH OF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AT TIMES TO ESSENTIALLY PAY FOR. THE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO THOSE STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROGRAM- BEEN IN IT SEEMS TO WORK- MY CONCERN IN IT THE SALUTE BILL ALONG THE LINES OF. THE EQUITY ISSUE AS WELL AS- FOR ONE THING LET ME JUST PUT A- BIG HUGE TAKE THE PRESSURE OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY WITH THE FISCAL SITUATION THEY'RE IN RIGHT NOW I'M NOT SURE THEY CAN CONTINUE DOING THAT- BUT WHAT ABOUT. YOU KNOW AREAS. IN THE STATE WERE THAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE I. AM JUST ONE WHAT. YOUR THOUGHTS ARE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. LOW BUDGET WASTE TO PROMOTE THE PROGRAM TO PROMOTE ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM- BUT- THIS THIS IDEA OF. HELLO OF THE MENTORS AND THE KIND OF ASSISTANCE THAT THAT REALLY. MAKES PEOPLE STEP IN THE PROGRAM. IS IT SOMETHING AND AGAIN I IN KNOWLEDGE EVEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF THIS WOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT YOUR EFFORTS SO JUST WONDER WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT BEFORE WE MOVE ON. THANK YOU SENATOR- LET ME JUST SAY THAT SAN JOSE STATE- ALONG WITH SACRAMENTO STATE ARE THE TWO LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADVANCE IN THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION PROGRAM WE REFER TO AS THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE IN. SACRAMENTO I THINK IT'S FINISHING FOR. SPARTAN PRODUCTS I MEAN EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT NAME FOR IT BUT THAT. THE POINT OF IT IS TO LET STUDENTS KNOW. THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS AND THE UNIVERSE IS THERE TO HELP THEM- SENATOR YOU KNOW THAT- FIVE YEARS AGO AT SAN JOSE STATE THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE WAS ELEVEN PERCENT. ELEVEN PERCENT- AT THE TIME THE SYSTEM WIDE GRADUATION RATE IN FOUR YEARS WAS 19% TODAY THAT RATE IS OVER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. IT'S MORE THAN DOUBLED IN FOUR YEARS THROUGH THE GREAT LEADERSHIP AT YOUR CAMPUS THERE. AND THE AND THE FACULTY IN THE UNIVERSITY. THE STATE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO STARTED PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FOR. THE CALPERS PROGRAM FOR THE GRADUATION FOR EFFORTS AND WE HAVE THROUGH OUR BUDGET HAVE BEEN PROVIDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR SPECIFICALLY TO HELP CAMPUSES LIKE YOURS AND OTHERS. TO PROMOTE THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE THAT ENHANCE ADVISING. BUDGET TO MAKE IT WORK AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE THAT COMMITMENT. TO OUR BUDGET PROCESS I KNOW THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS ONCE AGAIN STEPPED UP AND SAID I WANT TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS AND HE HAS PUT IN I THINK- THIS TWENTY MILLION BUT IT'S A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY I THINK. WE'D LIKE IT TO BE MORE- AND- THE CHALLENGE IN THE REASON THIS BILL IT'S BEEN PUT BEFORE USE THAT THE SYSTEMS DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND YOUR- TWO CAMPUSES IN PARTICULAR DOING EXTRAORDINARY WORK. BUT FOR MANY CAMPUSES THEY'RE NOT. AND THE ENROLLMENT IN THE IN THE PHOENICIAN FOR CAL POLICIES INCREDIBLY LOW- AND SO THIS IS A BILL TO NUDGE THEM TO DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER TO IMPROVE THAT. ENROLLMENT BY 5% EACH YEAR. AND THEY CAN DO IT THROUGH ADVERTISING THROUGH- IT YOU KNOW AND IN SOME OF THE UNIVERSITIES TAKE SEVEN CLICKS TO FIND THE CAL PROMISE PROGRAM ON THEIR WEBSITE. NOT ONE OR TWO BUT BUT SEVEN. BOB PROMOTING IT DURING ORIENTATION HAS A LOT TO THE INEXPENSIVE WAYS JUST LET STUDENTS NOW. IF THEY KNEW THEY COULD GET THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS. THE ENROLLMENT. IN THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER. AND FIND DEFECT DOES TO SAID PAN POINTS. THE FOLKS OF THE PROGRAM FROM THE BEGINNING WAS UNDER REPRESENTED. AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT AFTER THREE FULL YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION WE SEE THAT IS EXACTLY WHO IS BEING SERVED. AND SO THIS BILL SIMPLY CONTINUES THE GREAT EFFORT BY THE UNIVERSITY TO ADVANCE THAT I HOPE I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. YOU KNOW THEIR NO IT'S REASSURING AND SUPPORTIVE SO IN A CAME IN SUPPORT OF BUT IT JUST WANTED TO HEAR THAT REASSURANCE IN TERMS OF CONTINUING. THIS IS A FIGHT AT THIS LEVEL FOR WHATEVER NECESSARY FUNDING THERE IS TO MAKE SURE WE AREN'T. IT AT SOME POINT. SORT OF CREATE A PROGRAM AND THEN. UNINTENTIONAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HAVING KIDS OUT TO DRY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. A LITTLE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN MINDFUL THAT PLEASE SEND YOUR COMMENTS- I ALSO IF I MAY UM. BUT IN A GET INTO THE WEB. SO THAT THAT SOME. WE JUST HARD THAN IT IS FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO THE- TO LOCATE HOW TO GET A SENIOR TAX EXEMPTION- BOUNCING AROUND FROM WEBSITE TO WEBSITE- JUST TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE STATE A LITTLE BITON THE GRIP FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE THEY BASICALLY MOVED TO A FIVE YEAR. A BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM THERE BECAUSE BECAUSE UNIVERSITY ITSELF IS SO OVER SAID SUBSCRIBE SO IMPACTED THAT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS TO GET UP THE CLASSES THE NEED OVER A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM SO I JUST I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FIVE YOUR NUMBERS LOOK LIKE- AND I CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM I JUST WANTED TO SAY- THAT- I KNOW THEY HAVE OTHER ISSUES HERE THAT ARE. CONSTRAINING THEIR ABILITY TO. A TO GET STUDENTS IN AND OUT OVER FOUR YEAR CYCLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK CENTER CORTESE ANY OTHER QUESTION YES CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU I ALSO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE SENATOR I VOTED ON YOUR LAST PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK IT'S BEEN AWESOME SO I JUST WANNA SAY. THAT SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE- QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE I COULDN'T AND THE REASON WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T GO WAS BECAUSE WE WERE FARMERS WE HAD LAND BUT NO MONEY. AND SO WE DISCUSS IT DISQUALIFIED ME FOR ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR ANY OF THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOUR CASH IT RECOGNIZED YOUR- ASSETS. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I HAVE AND MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE SURE THEY GO TO. A COLLEGE AND FROM DAY ONE WE TOLD HIM THEY'RE GONNA GO BECAUSE WE KNOW THE VALUE OF THAT. AND SO AT THIS POINT I HAVE TWO SONS ATTENDING CAL POLY SAN LUIS. AND IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT ALSO IS VERY IMPACTED SO I WISH I WILL SHARE WITH YOU OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE ARMY THIS IS THE QUESTION- THE PROBLEM WITH GETTING OUT IN FOUR YEARS YOU CAN'T GET SOME OF THOSE CLASSES YOU HAVE TO HAVE BECAUSE ARE IMPACTED. WHICH MEANS THAT THERE'S NO MORE ROOM IN THE CLASS SO WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION DISADVANTAGED THOSE KIDS THAT ARE IN THIS PROGRAM AND BUMP THEM OUT AND THEN THOSE IMPACTED CLASSES WILL STILL BE IMPACTED AND THEY WON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GET THAT. THE CLASSES THEY NEED TO GET THEIR DEGREE. SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ADVANTAGE IN SOMEBODY TO TRY TO GET OUT FOR YEARS THE COST OF DISADVANTAGES SOMEBODY ELSE AND I'LL JUST. SAY THAT THE BIGGEST CALL I MEAN WE JUST HAD THE LAST BILL TALK ABOUT COST. COST IS THE COST OF LIVING I MEAN THE- RENT AND- ALL THOSE THINGS LIVING AWAIT ME KNOW YOU'RE BASICALLY SUPPLYING AND A SECOND HOUSEHOLD. FOR YOUR STUDENT- WHEN THEIR COLLEGE SO THOSE ARE THE COSTS THAT REALLY- WHO ARE. OKAY PACKING US AS WELL SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF GET A FLAVOR I DON'T. REALLY HAVE I NOT MADE MY MIND UP ON THIS BILL BECAUSE I WANT TO THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT. I WOULD LOVE FOR MY- SONS TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT IN FOUR YEARS BECAUSE IT'S A HECK OF A SAVINGS TO NOT HAVE. YOU KNOW EACH ONE OF THEM TWO EXTRA YEARS TO GET OUT. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY- LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ON IMPACTION THIS WAY- FIRST THE MAKE KNOWLEDGE THE POINT YOU JUST MADE WHICH IS THE- THE COST TO THE- STUDENT AND THEIR FAMILIES IS THE COST OF LIVING- AND THAT WHEN YOU GO FROM A FOUR YEAR DEGREE TO A FIVE OR SIX YEAR DEGREE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THOSE COSTS- AND EFFECT FOR MANY. STUDENTS TODAY. IN FACT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. ARE INCURRING THAT DEBT. AND THEY'RE NEVER GETTING A DEGREE. THINK ABOUT THAT TRAGEDY YOU KNOW SPENT A LOT OF THE TIME BUT- THE FOCUS OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- DEAL WITH THAT. THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR PROGRESS TOWARDS A DEGREE HERE'S AN INTERESTING FACTOID. ABOUT 90% OF THE STUDENTS. AT THE CSU. THAT SAN LUIS OBISPO AND ALL THE OTHER TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. THEY'RE TAKING A FULL LOAD RIGHT NOW. BUT THEY CAN'T THE CLASSES NECESSARILY. LEAN TOWARDS THAT DEGREE WHY IS THAT. SOME CASES IT'S IMPACTION BUT IMPACTION COMES BECAUSE THE CLASSES THAT THERE'S A COMPACTION IS WITHIN THE DEGREE PROGRAM AND THEN THERE'S ABILITY TO GET A CLASS SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I THINK YOU BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER. BUT THE ABILITY TO GET A CLASS IS A CENTRAL ISSUE THAT THE THESE CAMPUSES HAVE STRUGGLED WITH. AND WHETHER IT'S A PRE REQUISITE THAT ONE HAS TO TAKE IN A CERTAIN ORDER TO GET TO A DEGREE WHICH I THINK IS A SPEND SOME OF THE DEGREE PROGRAMS THAT SALAS OBISPO MUCH MORE CUTE. THE CAMPUSES OF GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT DEMAND AND MEET IT. AND IF YOU'RE OFFERING COURSES- AND- YOU KNOW- INTERNATIONAL ART. HISTORY AND NO ONE'S TAKING IT AND THEN YEAR COURSE IN ARCHITECTURE EVERYBODY'S TAKING IT YOU KIND OF STARTED JESTING. BUT TO MEET THAT DEMAND AND FOR MANY THE CAMPUSES THAT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE. THAT'S BEEN OF THAT'S BEEN A BIG BARRIER IS THE ABILITY TO SHIFT THE COURSES OFFERED TO WHAT STUDENTS WANT SO AS I TALKED AT THE BEGINNING THAT MOST STUDENTS ARE TAKING A FULL LOAD WIRES TO GET AT FIFTEEN UNITS A SEMESTER. SO WHY ARE THEY GETTING THROUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TAKING THE RIGHT COURSES BECAUSE THE COURSES THEY NEED ARE NOT AVAILABLE. AND SO THE PURPOSE OF THESE PROGRAMS LIKE CAL PROMISE IS TO PROVIDE THAT ENCOURAGEMENT THAT URGE THAT PUSH TO MAKE CAMPUSES BE MORE RESPONSIVE. AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE AND WHY THIS BILL THIS YEAR THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT ADVERTISING IT IS THE KIDS ARE GOING TO PUT THE MAN ON THEM TO MAKE THOSE COURSES AVAILABLE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NOT HAVE TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO SO KIDS CAN GET THOSE COURSES AND GET THROUGH LIKE YOUR SONS. AND SO IT'S ALL MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO ENCOURAGE THE CAMPUS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND TO GIVE THE KIDS THAT FOR YOUR TRACK THAT WILL SAY THAN A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY AND GET THEM TO DEGREE. WHICH. PROVIDES ENORMOUS LIFETIME VALUE. BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT. CLARIFICATION AT SO WILL THE- WILL IT. BOB OTHER OTHER STUDENTS THAT ARE PROBABLY TAKING A FULL LOAD OUT BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD WE'RE DEBATE WHERE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY SIGNS UP IN THIS PROGRAM THAT'S- KIND OF WHAT I WANTED TO GET AN ANSWER FOR. I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL. IF YOU HAVE A CAMPUS IT'S BEING RESPONSIVE TO STUDENT DEMAND. WHICH IS IN MANY CASES IN SOME CASES NOT HAPPENING TODAY. I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE MORE COURSE OFFERINGS OPENED UP FOR THE KIDS THAT WANT TO GET IT AND CAN'T IN ORDER TO STAY ON THAT TRACK I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA- IT'S GOING TO ME THE OTHER STUDENTS I MEAN I THINK IF YOU SEE A LOOK AT LOOK AT THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE FOUR YEARS AGO THE- FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE AT CSU WAS NINETEEN PERCENT. AND TODAY IT'S THIRTY AND I'VE SET A GOAL OF BRINGING IT 240% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. EVERYTHING IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION MORE KIDS ARE GETTING THEIR COURSES AND MORE KIDS ARE GRADUATING. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE SUCCESS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT THE PROVEN SUCCESS. MORE KIDS ARE GETTING THROUGH SO I THINK. THAT IRAQ'S AT ISRAEL IS FAIR ENOUGH. BUT I THINK THAT THE OVERALL IT'S MAKING ENORMOUS PROGRESS FOR OUR A BROADER STUDENT BODY AND I THINK YOUR- CHILDREN ALL. OF OUR CHILDREN. WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT. WELL I'M IN A THE MIDST OF FOR YOUR BILL I THINK YOU MAKE A- ARGUE. I WOULD SAY- AS SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST. LETTING THIS RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY WITH MY SONS. AS THE QUESTIONS YOU DON'T ASK THAT DON'T GET ANSWERED I MEAN WE WENT TO THE- ORIENTATION FOR. OUR OLDEST SON. A FEW YEARS BACK HE'S A JUNIOR. CAL POLY AND IS WAS LIKE THE YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT IT'S A GREAT COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY LOVES ST LOUIS IT'S- YOU KNOW CLOSE THE OCEAN IS BEAUTIFUL AND- HE SAID YOU A LOT OF OUR KIDS. ARE FIVE YEARS AND SO THAT SPURRED THE THOUGHT TO ME OF THE CALL I'M THINKING ABOUT THE COST MY SON'S THINKING ABOUT A- FIVE YEAR SOUNDS GREAT AS LONG AS HE'S NOT PAYING FOR BUT HE IS PAINFUL FOR EXCEL. THE WHY IS THAT DEALT WITH THE QUESTION IS WHY IS IT FIVE YEARS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET. NOW REALIZING HE'S A JUNIOR AND HE NEEDS TO TAKE HE'S GOING TO BE IT. IS TAKING CROPSCIENCE AND HE HAS TO DO LABS I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO WHICH IS REALLY DIFFICULT NOW WITH. ZOOMING YOU DON'T DO LABS VERY WELL IT WHEN YOU'RE- ZOOMING. OR IMPACT YOU JUST DON'T DON'T. AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE THAT ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES WITH AT FIVE YEARS WHICH IS AND- ANOTHER YEAR OF. YOU KNOW UP. TO TWELVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR JUST RENT- SO. ALL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I'M GONNA WATCH AS I'M- I WANT TO BE HELPFUL I THINK THIS IS A- ON THE RIGHT. YOUR TRACK RECORD WITH THE LAST PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS AWESOME. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. ADVANTAGE IN SOME OVER OTHERS AND- BECAUSE ARE ALL FACED WITH THE IMPACT PROBLEM THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND I THINK WE NEED TO. PUSH ON OUR- ON THE EDUCATION OF THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS TO. MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB CAN CANCELING THESE KIDS AND MAKING SURE THEY GET THE RIGHT CLASSES SO THEY CAN. GET OUT IN FOUR YEARS SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. RIGHT BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE UNDER GLAZER I WOULD JUST SAY. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THIS WORK THAT YOU DO WORK YOU'RE DOING. ACTUALLY OF THE FRUITFUL AND BE HELPING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE SO THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING THAT WORK. AND SENATOR DOLLY I WOULD SAY I WOULD CAL POLY POMONA AND MY PARENTS WERE THOSE PARENTS WHO MADE ENOUGH TO NOT BUT I COULDN'T QUALIFY FOR ANYTHING BUT THEY ALSO COULDN'T AFFORD TO SEND ME TO GIVE ME ANY MONEY FOR COLLEGE. BUT I HAD A GOOD UNION JOBS IF I WAS ABLE TO PUT MYSELF THROUGH COLLEGE. AND IT WAS ALSO A LOT CHEAPER WHEN OUR GIRLS WENT TO SCHOOL WE TOLD THAT WE WILL PAY BUT IF YOU DON'T FINISH IN FOUR YEARS THE REST IS ON YOU. SO THOSE LITTLE GIRLY FINISHED IN FOUR YEARS AND IT WAS ON US. BUT WHICH IS FINE SENATOR GLAZERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK PLEASE CLOSE. THANK YOU CHARLIE OF I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE NOT JUST FOR TODAY'S CONSIDERATION BUT FOR THE- COOPERATION SUPPORT THAT YOU'VE GIVEN ME OVER THE YEARS TO ADVANCE THIS PROGRAM YOU KNOW I CAME TO THE SENATE- AS A- BEING A TRUSTEE OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE. AND I GOT TO SEE THIS INCREDIBLE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM UP CLOSE. AND WHAT THEY DO WANT ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY IS BAR NONE THE BEST IN A IN A IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS FOCUS ON STUDENT SUCCESS NOT JUST GETTING STUDENTS ENGAGEMENT THROUGH IT. WAS IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN I GET DEEPER INTO THE ISSUE I'VE LEARNED THAT AT POMONA AND SAN BERNARDINO. THEY WERE THE TWO CAMPUSES THAT WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS TEN YEARS AGO. AND NOBODY REALLY KNEW ABOUT THEIR WORK IN THE WORK OF THE GREAT LEADERSHIP ON THOSE TWO CAMPUSES AND IT WAS MY LEARNING OF THEIR- THEIR PILOT PROGRAMS AND THE SUCCESS THEY WERE HAVING THAT. MOTIVATED ME TO ADVANCE THIS ON A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS AS A TRUSTEE AND HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. IS HAVING EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS NOT FROM MY WORK BUT FOR THE GREAT FACULTY AND UNIVERSITY LEADERS THAT WE HAVE. AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO THE GYM A LITTLE BIT THAT'S OUR JOB IS TO. TOO LITTLE OVERSIGHT AND TO ENCOURAGE AND TRY. TO MAKE THEM BE BETTER- AND I TO THAT THAT. THEY WILL HAVE THAT READ. IN I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR- TODAY. BIG CENTER. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SAID PAM MAN FOR. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE NUMBER TWO. SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LEYVA AYE. LEYVA AYE OTOBO. AYE THE TROUBLED BY CORTESE ALL RIGHT. COURTESY I DALY AYE. DALY YE GLAZER. GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE. PAN HI. AND I THAT BILLS OUT SIX ZERO. WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO SB FIFTY. SENATOR LEE MON IS GOING TO BE PRESENTING THERE SHE IS. GOOD MORNING SENATOR- SHE'S ARE USING S. B. FIFTY PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. CHAIR AND- SB FIFTY MAKES- AND CHANGE IT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM PARTICULARLY BY OPENING MORE OPTIONS FOR INFANTS TODDLERS. I PERSONALLY KNOW HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO LOOK FOR CHILD CARE OPTIONS WITH AN INFANT MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS BASICALLY THE SAME STRUGGLES. CURRENTLY OUR SYSTEM IS ONLY SERVING 10% OF ELIGIBLE INFANTS AND TODDLERS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR INFANT AND TODDLER CARE AND S. B. HE WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEFFICIENCY IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT CAN BETTER SERVE CHILDREN FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY CHANGES BUT ALLOWS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND PARENTS MORE FLEXIBILITY FIRST THIS BILL WILL OPEN AT THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE. OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS WE HAVE MADE SEVERAL INVESTMENTS TO STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM BUT HAVE NOT MADE THE SAME TYPES OF INVESTMENTS FOR INSTANCE IN TODDLERS. BY OPENING A STATE PROGRAM TO MORE AGES BEING ANSWERED MORE UNDERSERVED INFANTS TODDLERS AND ALLOW FOR WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR CHILDREN'S NGK. AND INTEGRATE. THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR PROVIDE TO TRY THE STATE PRESCHOOL AND CHILD CONT. EVEN PROVIDERS MARK. TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE THAT CHILDREN DO NOT LOSE CARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GREAT DAY. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ENABLE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS JUST YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. FINALLY THIS BILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO ENROLL IN STEAM ROLLED IN CHILD CARE IT EASES THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON PARENTS TO PROVIDERS BY ESTABLISHING TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS LEGIBILITY AND ALLOWING FOR CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY. I AM COMMITTED TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO REFINE THIS BILL AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME E. R. E. BAGHEL APPARENT FROM SAN JOSE AND LISA LOOK AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FROM THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT CONSORTIUM OF LOS ANGELES IT'S IMPORTANT THE BILL AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CENTER AMOUNT WILL GO TO YOUR LEAD WITNESSES ARE. MS HELLO IF YOU'RE READY PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING- SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO SHARE MY STORY WITH YOU MY NAME IS GETTING OUT OF ALL I WAS BORN IN MEXICO AND REYES. FAMILY EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF MY LIFE I WILL BRING A MOTHER OF A THREE YEAR OLD BOY FINDING AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE CENTER HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR THE PAST YEAR UNTIL I FOUND FAITH IN THE CHILD CARE CENTER. IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND ONE. FROM MY THIRDS. I HAD TO FINDING SOMETHING THAT I COULD AFFORD. TO TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO FIND A PROGRAM THAT MET MY NEEDS THAT THE WORKING MOM. WHEN I RETURNED FROM MATERNITY LEAVE I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO FIND A BABYSITTER ON MY OWN. SHE CARE FOR MY SON FOR MY INTERNSHIP COULD NO LONGER WATCH. I HAD A WEEKEND TO FIGURE OUT WHO I WAS GOING TO LEAVE MY BABY WITH SO THAT I COULD SHOW UP TO WORK ON MONDAY. I WATCH FOR THE HELPLESS SITUATION I FOUND MYSELF AND- I WENT FROM BABYSITTER THE BABYSITTER. THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANTED FOR MY SON. IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL MY CHILD AS AN INFANT TODDLER. I WOULD FEEL HAPPY KNOWING THAT MY SON WOULD BE TAKING CARE OF ATTY THE QUALITY. BUT HE WAS ALSO LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT. SKILL BE CONSERVANCY OF TAKING HIM TO A CHILD CARE CENTER WHERE I KNOW HE WOULD BE LOVED. TALKING CARE BOARD. WOULD RELIEVE ME FROM MUCH UNNECESSARY STRESS. LET ALONE HELPING. AND VALUABLE THAN EDUCATE EXPERIENCE. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR MY SON AT THE GYM EARLY AGE. AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO FOR HIS ACADEMIC SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE. WHY EXPANSION OF INFANT CHILD CARE CENTERS IN VERY MUCH NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY. I AM A TEACHER BUT MY EARNINGS ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND DELAPORTE LIVE IN ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE. IN CALIFORNIA. I MAKING ENDS MEET WITH WHAT I CAN'T. I KNOW THAT MANY OTHER PARENTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE TROUBLE FINDING AFFORDABLE QUALITY CHILDCARE. PENSION THE INFANTILE CARE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY STORY. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT AT THE FIFTY AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT UP WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS WILL CAN ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM. PLEASE PROCEED THE MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FINALLY TO WALK AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT CONSORTIUM OF LOS ANGELES OR CDC LA. WHERE A TITLE SCIENCE CENTER BASED DIRECT CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY. P. FIFTY PROVIDE PROPOSES TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT WILL CREATE EFFICIENCIES FOR BOTH THE FAMILIES AND THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM TO SEARCH THEM. ONE SUCH EFFICIENCY IS THE ABILITY FOR FAMILIES TO BE CATEGORICALLY ELIGIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SERVICES. IF THEY HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED ELIGIBILITY FOR ANOTHER MEANS TESTED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE OR CALFRESH. CURRENTLY FAMILIES HAVE TO PROVE THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH EACH PROGRAM HAVING TO CERTIFY THE FAMILY SEPARATELY. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME FOR THE FAMILY TO MAY HAVE TO GATHER NEW DOCUMENTATION EACH TIME. WAIT WHILE EACH PROGRAM WORKS TO CONFIRM THAT THE DOCUMENTATION IS VALID. ONCE BILL BECOMES LAW A FAMILY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CERTIFIED ONE TIME IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING STATE PRESCHOOL. AND THEN TAKE PROOF OF THAT CERTIFICATION TO ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. CHILDCARE PROGRAMS WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO USE THAT CERTIFICATION IS PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY SAVING HOURS OF. CLERICAL WORK AND ADMINISTRATIVE TIME. SHOULD BE WOULD ALLOW CHARTER PROGRAMS THE ABILITY TO BURN OUR CONTRACT BASED ON CHILD ENROLLMENT NOT ATTENDANCE. CURRENTLY UCLA PROGRAM STAFF SPEND OUT COUNTLESS HOURS TRACKING ATTENDANCE AND ABSENCES. EACH ABSENCE MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR BASED ON THE REASON FOR THE ABSENCE. AND FAMILIES MAY LOSE CARE IF THEIR CHILD IS ABSENT FOR THE WRONG REASON TOO MANY TIMES. WHEN EXCUSE DOESN'T THAT ARE GENERALLY NOT REIMBURSABLE LEAVING THE CONTRACT TURNING OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM. OPERABLE TO FIND ANOTHER CHILD TO FILL THE EMPTY SPACE LEFT BY A PERIODICALLY ABSENT CHILD AND PROGRAMS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENROLL EXTRA CHILDREN. CAN MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE OF LICENSING REGULATIONS. REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON ENROLLMENT WHAT ALLOW PROGRAMS A MORE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE BASE EARNINGS GIVING US MORE TIME TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN OUR PROGRAM. EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO INCLUDE INFANTS AND TODDLERS IS ANOTHER WAY TO STREAMLINE THE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS AND BETTER ENSURE THAT CHILD DEVELOPMENT FUNDS ARE NOT RETURNED TO THE STATE. FAMILIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING ALL OF THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN SERVED UNDER THE SAME CONTRACT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEIR INFANTS AND TODDLERS COULD ROBERT PLEASE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AND THEN GO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A SEPARATE CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR THEIR PRESCHOOLERS. WITH TWO SEPARATE CONTRACTS UNDERTAKEN SEPARATELY THE LAPTOP YOU WELL OVER THE LINE. AS A CHILD CARE THAT WATER WOULD AGE OUT OF THE PROGRAM. I'VE HIGHLIGHTED JUST A FEW OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT SB FIFTY WOULD MAKE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THERE ARE MORE YOUR SUPPORT WOULD PROVIDE BENEFITS TO BOTH THE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS AND THE FAMILIES THEY SERVE THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LAURIE FURSTENFELD AND I AM THE CO DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL ADVOCACY AT THE CHILD CARE LAWCENTER. I SUPPOSE THIS BILL AND MY SKIN IS AMENDED WE SUPPORT THE PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY AND TWENTY FOUR MONTH ELIGIBILITY THESE PROVISIONS THAT HELP THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. PROBLEM IS THAT THIS BILL CURRENTLY EXCLUDES FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WRITERS MAINLY WOMEN OF COLOR AND THOSE WITH THE LEAST RESOURCES HAVE CARRIED THE HEAVIEST BURDEN ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC WE OFFER THE FLEXIBLE HOURS THAT HEARING TEAM ESPECIALLY ESSENTIAL WORKER AND THEY MUST BE INCLUDED AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE FACTIONS WERE INCLUDED BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THE INDIVIDUAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. ARE NOT INCLUDED IN. MOREOVER THIS BILL IT'S- REINFORCES THE FAMILY FEAST THAT PARENTS MUST PAY. THE FEES KEEP FAMILIES FROM GAINING MOUTH KEEP THEM FROM BEING ECONOMICALLY SECURE WE NEED TO MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR ALL FAMILY. WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE ON THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SECTOR-LIMóN FOR BRING THIS BILL FOR DAVID- IT'S A- FAIRLY- YOU KNOW COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE CHILD CARE MORE. IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND I KNOW THAT'S KIND OF SOUTH OF GOOD MOVE ON TO HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE WHERE I SIT ON AS WELL I DID HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HELP CLARIFY FOR ME- SO THIS ESSENTIALLY ONE OF ONE OF THE ISSUE. WELL THE THING IS THAT- TO WORK THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WILL NOW SO SAID DIRECTLY CONTACT MISTY YEAH THEY CAN CUT- AND- BASICALLY STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM BE A CONTRACT FOR SUBSEA ALL AGE SHE OUGHT TO- BASICALLY TO THE YOUNGER AGES. BUT I ALSO NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT. THAT THERE ISN'T. THAT I GUESS THEY'RE PAYING A STANDARD RATE SO THERE'S AND SOME INCREASED HEY THAT NORMALLY BE GIVEN TO INFANT TODDLER CARE. WHICH OF COURSE IS MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE SMALL ILL BILL RATIOS AND SO FORTH. SO THAT I'D BE DECORATIVE YOU'D THINK YOU JUST ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF PAYMENT IF YOU GO THROUGH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR ENSIGN TODDLER CARE THAT. THEY'RE NOW GOING TO HAVE CONTRACTS FOR. RIGHT SO THIS. THE IDEA IS NOT TO RECALL EIGHT TO ALLOW. FOR THAT POSSIBILITY FOR THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED. I TO CONTRACT THROUGH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THERE IS A DIFFERENT BILL GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE SB TWO FOUR SIX. THAT DEALS WAIT. EIGHT INCREASES- AND THAT IS A BROADER CONVERSATION IN BETWEEN ZERO FIVE CARE- AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO SPEAK ON THAT IT'S NOT MY BILL BUT IT IS CERTAINLY A PART OF THIS EQUATION THIS IS ONE OF THE- A COMBINATION OF BILLS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE- IT SB YOU FOR SIX. BILL SB FIFTY AND THEN ALSO AB TWENTY TWO AT TRY. TO IT WAYS BUT TO ADDRESSING A MORE HOLISTIC WAY OKAY APPRECIATE THAT NOW THAT- AND- APPRECIATE YOU BRING UP THAT SHOULD BE LOOKING SOME OF THESE OTHER BILLS- SO BUT BUT JUST TO CLARIFY YOU DID ASYOU SAID THAT WAS AT LEAST AS FAR AS THIS BILL CONCERNED MAYBE ADDRESS AND AN AND ONE THE OTHER BILLS IS THAT. IF YOU GO THROUGH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH WAS BEFORE OF OTHER THREE IN ABOUT THE NOW IT'S COVERING ALL AGES. THEN AGAIN A REALIZE IT'S AN OPTION IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT- THAT IF YOU DO DO THAT THOUGH THERE ISN'T AN INK YOU YOU BASICALLY GET PAID ONE RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT THE AGES THERE'S NO INSTANCE DIFFERENCE AND- YOU DON'T GET INCREASE PAYMENT FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO THROUGH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM CORRECT. YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DEFERRED MY- TO ANSWER THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU IT AT THE- MS WELCOME WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MON SHE HAS BELIEVE THAT THE RATE FOR INSTALLERS IS HIGHER THAN IT IS FOR THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL AND THAT WAY WE CAN FOLLOW OUTSIDE BECAUSE THIS IS AGAIN THIS BILL WILL BE GOING TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE FENCE SITTING ON AS WELL SO WE CAN. WILL PUT A PIN ON THAT ONE. IF I MAY CENTER. THIS MIGHT HELP ON THAT THE BILL INCREASES REIMBURSEMENT. RATES ONLY FOR INFANTS THAT ARE BEING SERVED BY PRESCHOOL I BELIEVE. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THE DETACHED HELPFUL AND AGAIN MAYBE WE CAN. DIG INTO A LITTLE MORE AS YOU MENTIONED OR SOME OTHER BILLS OUT THERE AS WELL ALL RIGHT. NOW PRE APPRECIATE THAT- AND THEN THE OTHER. QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SO IN TERMS OF- BURKE SWITCHING FROM- DAY SERVE TO AND TO ENROLLMENT IN TERMS OF PAIN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW SO THAT. YOU DO HAVE FAMILIES WHERE. THERE NEED FOR CHILD CARE MAYBE MORE I WANT TO SPREAD IS A GREAT WORD BUT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY ACT SIDE ACCESS IT GIVEN EIGHTY PERHAPS DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE CAN DO BY ENROLLMENT I CERTAINLY HEARD THE WITNESS AND SUPPORT THAT WILL ALLOW THE OPTION TAKING CARE OF MORE CHILDREN. I DID JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHEN IT COMES. IF YOU'RE DOING IT BY IN ROME AND- SO AND ROLL. LOCATOR ONLY ACCESS IT YOU KNOW A HALF TIME OR SOMETHING. DOES DAN THIS IS THE CHILD CARE PROVIDER REQUIRED TO THE VAN YES I MEAN DO THEY JUST THAT TO TAKE ON. SOME MORE DAYS WITH ANOTHER CHILD OR DO THEY JUST KEEP THE MONEY AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE X. NUMBER ROMAN EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE PEOPLE AND ROLLED ARE ONLY USING A PORTION. FOR WHATEVER REASON SO WHICH I TALK CLEAR FOR HOW THAT WORKS OUT SO YOU SIT IS ACTUALLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ON MORE CHILDREN BECAUSE SOMEONE MAY NOT BE USING IT FULL TIME OR ONLY USING PORTIONS OF TIME BUT- HOW DOES THAT SORT ITSELF OUT BUT- YEAH. YES THIS IS ACTUALLY. A FORMULA THAT THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND USE IT IN ORDER TO BECAUSE THERE ARE ALSO GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF RATIOS. FOR ALL OF THIS RIGHT AND SO THEY HAVE TO. UNDERSTAND IF SOMEONE IS ENROLLED FULL TIME OR PART TIME. AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RATIOS SO BOTH PART TIME AND FULL TIME- ARE POSSIBLE. AND THERE ARE A REALITY NOW AND- THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE BUT IT DOES ALSO HAVE TO ALIGN WITH THE RATIOS THAT. ARE APPROPRIATE AND WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH RATIOS IN THIS BILL OKAY NOT IT'D AND DEAD BE INTERESTED IN. HEARING MORE DETAILS PERHAPS AFTERWARDS- IT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU POINTED OUT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE A FAMILY FAMILY THAT HAS YOUR CHILD AND YOUR CHILD CARE. STATE YOU'LL FOR WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES- NEEDED A WORK SCHEDULE MAYBE THEIR SOCIAL SITUATION. THEY'RE NOT USING IT ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN RATIO SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST AUTOMATICALLY TAKE ON ANOTHER CHILD BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AT CETERA ND THEN SO HOW DOES THE MONEY END UP. YOU KNOW HOW THE MONEY FLOW CHANGES WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILLS ONE TRYING TO AND BETTER UNDERSTAND. SINCE WE'RE MOVING TO ENROLLMENT. VERSUS SO- IT DIDN'T DEAL IT'S GOOD AND IT'S- I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S A NEGATIVE CHANGE I THINK IT PROBABLY IS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF. INCREASING ACCESS TO CHILD CARE AND CREATING MORE ACCESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW YOURSUPPORTERS ADVOCATE YES SAYING THAT THIS WOULD CREATE. LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT OPERATIONALLY WOULD WORK AND WE CAN PERHAPS- BUT DISCUSS. THAT AFTER THIS BILL PASSES AS IT'S MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SETTLEMENT FOR ANSWER MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE SAN RAMON I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IS THAT. THE PROVIDER WOULD KEEP THE MONEY AND THE SLOT WOULD STAY THERE SO THAT THE CHILD WOULD HAVE ACCESS I BELIEVE IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID- DURING THE PANDEMIC WHERE. SOMEBODY CHILD CARE CENTERS LOST ENROLLMENT- BUT WE KNEW THIS STUDENTS FOR- OF THE CHILDREN GOING TO COME. THIS WE WANT MAKE SURE THE PRIEST FOR. SO THAT THEY- CAN WELCOME THOSE BACK I THINK THAT MY- HELP A LITTLE BIT AND- SENATOR LET ME KNOW I'M WRONG. AND PLEASE CALL WHEN YOU'RE READY. ET I MANAGER YOU'RE CORRECT IN THAT IT PROVIDES DISABILITY RIGHT ONCE WE KNOW. THAT SAYS WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW FULL TIME OR PART TIME ENROLLMENT THAT STUDENT AND THEIR FAMILY HAVE THAT SPOT WHATEVER THAT SPOT IS- AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT. I EIGHTEEN KEEPS THE STABILITY. IN AN ERA WHERE ESPECIALLY GETTING THE PANDEMIC. WHERE IT'S CHANGED SO MUCH SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFYING THAT- AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. DECEMBER LIMóN WE HAVE A MOTION. ALMOST THANK YOU THE MOTEL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN. META CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM THREE SB FIFTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES LEYVA.

IS THAT A LIMóN IS GOING TO S. B. C. THIRTY SEVEN FOR C. WHEN YOU'RE A- THANK YOU SB SEVEN THIRTY SO AND A LOT OF THE- STUDENT ARE. ACCESS KNOWN AS KELCE. I HAVE PROOF UNDERSTAND ON HOW KELSO OPERATES IN ITS MISSION PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATURE I WORKED FOR THE KELSO PROGRAMMING IN MY DISTRICT ASSISTING STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ON HOW THEY CAN ACHIEVE HIGHER EDUCATION. THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WORKSHOPS READ CENTRAL TO ENSURE THAT THE- ENTER STANDING ABOUT FINANCIAL PASSED FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. THIS BILL UPDATE THE STATUTE TO REINFORCE THE PROGRAM'S FUNCTIONS JUST SERVICE FINANCIAL AID AWARENESS LITERACY AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE CURRENT GOVERNING STATUTE OF KELSO HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE ITS CREATION AND ITS MODERNIZATION IS ESSENTIAL TRIPS LIKE THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS TODAY. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND THE QUALIFYING PEOPLE CRITERION RECOGNITION OF THE DAY FIRST NEEDS EVERY STUDENT POPULATION. CURRENTLY THE KELSO PROGRAMMES CONSIST OF SIXTEEN REGIONAL PROJECTS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. DISCOUNTS ARE PROJECTS HAVE STATUTORY MANDATE TO IMPROVE THE HIGHER EDUCATION BY RAISING THE ACADEMIC ELIGIBILITY UNDERSERVED. STUDENT POPULATIONS. WITH ME TODAY MILLER BAR I JUST AND WITH THE- STATE EIGHT. AND YOU SAID FINANCE OF KELSO AND- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER WE WILL GO TO LEAD SUPPORT MS BARTON ARE YOU READY. YES I AM THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TURN NUMBER THEM THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS MELISSA BARTO LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAD CO SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE. SB SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN WHAT UPDATE THE STATUTORY FUNCTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS PROGRAM ALSO FOR SHORT A PROGRAM OF THE COMMISSION HAVE OPERATED FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. ALSO CONSIDER SIXTEEN REGIONAL. WITH THE STATUTORY MANDATE TERM GROUP ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION BY RAISING THE ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL AND COLLEGE ELIGIBILITY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. WILL BE BOTH ARE IMPORTANT THERE ARE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENT FUNDED PROGRAMS SUCH AS AVERAGE TRIO AND EUROPE THE ALREADY PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP IN HIGHER EDUCATION. SB SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN WOULD HELP TO RE PROVISION ACOSTA PROGRAM AT THE STATE'S PRIMARY FINANCIALLY TO WEAR AND I THOUGHT I THINK THE PROGRAM. AND AVOID. DUPLICATIVE THE AVERAGE FOR. OVERALL OUR WHEN I SEVEN SEVEN UP THE FACT YOU COVER CAL. TO REFLECT THE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP STUDENTS AND FAMILIES UNDERSTAND THE TRUE COST OF COLLEGE UNDERSTAND THEIR FINANCING OPTIONS AND APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID USING A BAFTA OR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION.

FURTHERMORE IN RECOGNITION OF THE GROWING BASIC NEEDS CRISIS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS IT'S CLEAR TO US THAT THE STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE. IF CRISIS HAS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COBRA NINETEEN PANDEMIC I'VE DEMONSTRATED BY OUR CORPORATE NINETEEN STUDENT SURVEY WHICH FOUND THAT SEVEN IN TEN STUDENTS OFF SOME OR ALL OF THEIR INCOME.

AND THROUGH THIS FAIRLY CHALLENGING PROCESS NOW I ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE'S ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT USES VOLUNTEERS TO CASH FOR COLLEGE. PROGRAM CAN YOU SPEAK TO. WELL- WHAT'S BEING DONE. WITH TERMS OF INTEGRATING THE TWO SO THAT THERE. ISN'T DUPLICATIONS AND OTHER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THAT'S KELSO PUES YEAH THAT THAT JOSH PARRIS RELIES ON VOLUNTEERS WHICH CAN BE LESS. STABLE BUT KEY TO SPEAK TO. HOW WE CAN READ MINIMIZE DUPLICATION ARE EVEN DO YOU BRING TO PROGRAM TOGETHER IN SOME WAY SO AND THEN HAVE A VOLUNTEER COMPONENTS- THAT THAT SAYS SIMILAR CASH FOR COLLEGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR AND I ACTUALLY USED TO RUN THE CASH FOR COLLEGE WORKSHOP IN SANTA BARBARA SOUTH NUMBER COUNTY WHEN I WAS RECORDING BURKE KELSO SO I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM.

AND IT STANDS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN EVERY STATE IN EVERY REGION IN SOME REGIONS YOU WILL SEE CAL SO TAKE THE LEAD AND OTHERS YOU HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE UPWARD BOUND YOU HAVE VOLUNTEERS THEY'RE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE HIGHER ADD. ON BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY AN INITIATIVE I THAT IS NOT A STANDALONE INITIATIVE THERE'S NOT ONE PERSON OR ONE ENTITY LEADING- IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE REGION AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS DUPLICATION I THINK THE NEED FOR. INFORMATION FOR FINANCIAL AID IS SO. IMPORTANT AND IT IS REALLY WE'RE NOT NEEDING- DID YOU KNOW ARE NOT. EVERY SINGLE STUDENT WAY THAT WE- STILL I DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF DUPLICATION CASH FOR COLLEGE IS ALSO IS A ONE TIME SNAPSHOTS. RIGHT THAT HAPPENED TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS MEET THE MARCH SECOND DEADLINE FINANCIAL LITERACY I THINK HAPPENS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE'RE TRYING TO HIT. YOU KNOW HIGH SCHOOLS GOING TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS THEMSELVES I'M DOING SOME OF THIS WHILE STUDENTS ARE THINKING ALREADY ABOUT THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS STILL THERE. IN MY OPINION- FROM WHAT I'VE LIVED IN SCENE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DUPLICATION. THESE ARE JUST DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT APPLY DEPENDING ON THE REGION AND HOW TO MAXIMIZE. THE MOST NUMBER OF WHAT WE YOU KNOW LEADER CALLED POSITIVE HIT THE MOST NUMBER OF HITS WITH STUDENTS. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT ANSWER I REALLY APPRECIATE.

I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN ALL OF YOU THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN FACED IN EDUCATION MAKING SURE YOUNG PEOPLE. AREN'T LEFT TOO FAR BEHIND DURING THE PANDEMIC WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL IS AN EFFORT TO MERGE TWO OF OUR- VERY VALUABLE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS WELL AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE DO WHAT WE CAN THAT TO. ASSIST YOUNG PEOPLE IN ACCESSING THAT WONDERFUL RESOURCE OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS THIS BILL BILL WOULD. IN ESSENCE ENCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP. SO THAT EVERYONE EVERY SCHOOL AGE CHILD IN CALIFORNIA HAS A LIBRARY CARD- IT IS AN UNDER UTILIZED RESOURCE BUT A VERY VALUABLE RESOURCE.

SAUDI AFTER STUDY SHOWS THAT STUDENTS WHO DO NOT ACHIEVE READING PROFICIENCY BY THIRD GRADE ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. OVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXACERBATED EXISTING INEQUITIES WITH REGARD TO STUDENT LITERACY READING COMPREHENSION AND ACCESS TO EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WE BELIEVE SB THIRTY FOUR IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT YOUR PUBLIC INSTITUTION CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THEIR LOCAL LIBRARIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF STUDENTS. WHILE MAINTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF LOCAL CONTROL BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES. SANTA ANA UNIFIED WITH ABLE TO ESTABLISH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH SANTA ANA PUBLIC LIBRARY AND JUST UNDER NINE MONTHS. EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC THE PROGRAM WENT LIVE JUST TWO MONTHS LATER EARLIER THIS YEAR. HUNDREDS OF SANTA ANA UNIFIED STUDENTS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE- LIBRARY PROGRAM ALREADY.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS JOHN ROSS- IT REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY FOUR- THIS IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO GET- LIBRARY CARDS IN THE HANDS OF STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. AND AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE MOVED TO OPPOSITION CENTER I'M BURKE ARE YOU GOING TO BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE SUGGEST. YES MANAGER YES THANK YOU I THOUGHT YOU WERE BY JUST LIKE CLARIFY THANK YOU SIR ALL RIGHT. LEAD OPPOSITION IS ACTUALLY HERE WITH US OUR CRISTINA DEPLORABLE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM CRISTINA TO CARL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION SB THIRTY FOUR. FEEL IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF LOCAL CONTROL AND THE UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT THIS BILL CREATES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT SEGMENTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AT ONE POINT LIBRARIES WERE RECEIVING EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING. FOR GENERAL SUPPORT COOPERATIVE LENDING AND ADULT LITERACY. GOVERNOR BROWN AND HIS TWO PREDECESSORS REDUCED IT TO ZERO. WE STRUGGLE NOW TO EVEN GET ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE BUDGET EACH YEAR FOR OUR PROGRAMS. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR TO REQUIRE THE M. AWAY TO INCLUDE A PROVISION FOR HOW THE COSTS WOULD BE COVERED BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THE LIBRARY THIS DOES LITTLE GOOD WHEN EITHER SIDE HAS NO MONEY. IN ELDORADO COUNTY THERE ARE FIFTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND NOT ONE M. AWAY BETWEEN THE DISTRICT AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. THE LIBRARY DIRECTOR TELLS US THEIR QUOTE. MOST OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO DO THIS AS THEY ARE VERY UNDER FUNDED. AND THEY HAVE VERY LIMITED I. T. TECH SUPPORT. WE DEFINITELY DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES TO CREATE AMMO USE. AND CONNECT WITH OUR FIFTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHOUT FUNDING AND NEITHER DO THEY END QUOTE. SO THE REALITY IS THE COST RECOVERY AMENDMENT IS ONLY HELPFUL WHEN THERE'S SUFFICIENT FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR BOTH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE LIBRARY. THE COST FOR THE LIBRARIES UNDER SB THIRTY FOUR INCLUDE ATTORNEY FEES TO CRAFT THE AWAY. STAFF RESOURCES TO ADMINISTER THE DATABASE. PRINT AND DISSEMINATE PR TYPE MATERIALS WHICH ONE LIBRARY SAID COSTS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. CREATION OF THE CARD ITSELF. TRAINING TEACHERS AND VISITING THE SCHOOL TO QUOTE EDUCATE PUPILS. AND ADDING A NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE LIBRARY'S PERFORM 75% 290% OF THE WORK FOR THESE PROJECTS. AND WE KNOW WE WILL GET LEFT HOLDING THE BAG FINANCIALLY. ONE LIBRARY DIRECTOR SAID IT BEST FOR THE LIBRARY IT MAY MEAN WE CLOSE THE LIBRARY FOR AN HOUR EACH DAY SO THAT STAFF CAN WORK ON THE MANDATE. RATHER THAN SERVE THE LIKE. FINALLY THIS PART. ARE HAPPENING ALL ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT A MANDATE. LOCAL CONTROL IS CRITICAL BECAUSE EVERY LOCAL SITUATION IS DIFFERENT AND EVERY COMMUNITY HAS DIFFERENT STANDARDS. UNTIL A BUDGET LINE ITEM CAN BE CREATED FOR THIS PURPOSE WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB THIRTY FOUR MIKE DYLAN AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CARRO. WE WILL NOW GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY FOR ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WE WILL COME BACK TO THE TELEPHONE LINES META MODERATED WITH ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK. IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTY FOUR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO YOU. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE THING THERE ARE NOW. AT THIS MOMENT AND HERE WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR CORTESE THAN SENATOR PAM. PLEASE PROCEED CENTER CORTESE. THE FIGHT THE PODIUM THE FOR ME CENTER NUMBER- TO SET UP ASKING YOU TO RESPOND- TO THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD BUT A JUDGE IS GOING TO PROVIDE. ONE MINUTE OF CAUGHT TEXAS DIVIDE PARTICULARLY. CONCERNED A CAME IN CONCERNED- AND WE'RE NOT AT THE APPROPRIATIONS STAGE AT THIS POINT- BUT JUST. WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAVE ANSWERS IN TERMS OF MY OWN. A DISTRICT MOUNT CONSTITUENCIES- WE HAVE TO. BRANCH LIBRARY SO. IN MY DISTRICT ONE IS THE CITY OF SAN JOSE'S. MUCH HERALDED BRANCH LIBRARY SYSTEM WHICH- TO SOME DEGREE HAS HAS DEEPER POCKETS- YOU KNOW THEN THEN A LOT OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS THE OTHER IS THE COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT WHICH IS A SEPARATE ENTITY AND RUNS ON A VERY SKINNY BUDGET ALTHOUGH IT HAS OF A VERY SUBSTANTIAL BRANCH LIBRARY. SYSTEM GEOGRAPHICALLY- IT STRIKES ME THAT IN THE ONE CASE IT MAY BE VERY DOABLE. WITH THE CITY PROGRAM WHERE THEY HAVE A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET TO. TO WORK THIS OUT WITH THE SCHOOLS- BUT IT STRIKES ME AS- IT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF GRANT PROGRAM OR SOMETHING- EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. FOR THE COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT- UPON WHOSE BORDER ONCE SAT- TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN ALONG THE LINES OF THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS WE HEARD- IT IS IT. I'M SURE YOU'VE STUDY THIS AND TALK THROUGH IT AND ARE AWARE OF ALL THOSE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES THAT ARE OUT THERE- COULD YOU JUST GIVE US ANY THOUGHTS ON WHERE YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE GOING IN TERMS OF PROTECTING- FOLKS FROM. YOU KNOW THE STRAW THE STRAW THE BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK SO TO SPEAK THAT'S ALL I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT NOT ORDINARILY THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS GET WORKED OUT SOMEHOW. FINANCIALLY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE IN PLACE TO HELP CUSHION THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE RUNNING ON A THIN MARGIN. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE FOR THAT QUESTION. BOB FIRST. I THINK IT'S SAD THAT EVERY SCHOOL AGE CHILD CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A LIBRARY CARD I THINK IT'S VERY SAID THAT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WOULD BE OPPOSED TO. HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR WHOMEVER ELSE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE. SO I THINK THE COSTS HAVE BEEN GREATLY EXAGGERATED- THIS DOESN'T REQUIRE. A DETAILED. AGREEMENT THE SIMPLY REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING. ALTHOUGH WRITTEN BETWEEN BOTH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL AS AS WELL AS A LIBRARY SYSTEM. IT'S NOT THAT HARD IT'S REALLY NOT THAT HARD- TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE AN HOUR A DAY AT THE LIBRARY TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO ALLOW SCHOOL CHILDREN TO COME TO THE LIBRARY. SEEMS LIKE. A BIT MUCH BOB. IF THERE IS A COST INVOLVED IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT- CAN'T AFFORD TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE LIBRARY OR LIBRARY CAN'T AFFORD TO NEGOTIATE. WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IT IT MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE IT A BUDGET ITEM IT MAY REQUIRE US TO AS A MATTER OF POLICY DECIDE THAT EVERY SCHOOL AGE CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE IN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO LIBRARIES AND SO IF THAT BECOMES A FACT AND THEN I WILL DEAL WITH IT ACCORDING TO ITS WITH SOME SORT OF A BUDGET REQUEST. BUT RIGHT NOW- WE'RE WE'RE SIMPLY CREATING A MECHANISM AND ENCOURAGEMENT FOR. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LIBRARIES TO COME TOGETHER. SO IF THANK YOU SO THANK YOU MANAGER. FOR SENATOR PENN THANK YOU THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND DOESN'T REMEMBER GUYS CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO LIBRARIES BY DID HAVE I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS MAYBE I CAN ASK THE OPPOSITION TO FIRST OF ALL ANSWER QUESTIONS SO- WHAT DOES IT TAKE. TO GIVE SOMEONE A LIBRARY CARD. LIKE WHAT'S INVOLVED FOR THE LIBRARY TO CENTURY OFFER A LIBRARY CARD IS IT SIMPLY. WRITE SOMETHING A PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MINERS THERE TRACKING USER DATA INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED TO DO BECAUSE OF SINGLE EVERY CARDIN. RESULTING ABILITY TO BORROW MATERIALS I WANT TO SAY BOOKS ANYMORE SENATE LEVERAGED A LOT MORE THAN THAT NEED TO SPEAK TO THE- THE- WHAT. WHAT WE MIGHT NOT KNOW IS THE PUBLIC IS GOING ON THE BACK AND TO GET TO OFFER A LIBRARY CARD. CERTAINLY CENTER I'LL MY BEST. I CAN YOU WHEN I COULD WALK INTO A LIBRARY RIGHT NOW AND REQUEST A LIBRARY CARD AND WE WOULD GIVE A VERY BASIC INFORMATION ARE NAME ADDRESS ETCETERA. THE LIBRARIES TRY TO KEEP AS LITTLE INFORMATION ON FILE ABOUT YOU AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING YOUR CIRCULATION RECORDS. WHERE HE GETS INTO THE ISSUE OF- THE AGREEMENTS. THEN THERE ARE SOME VERY DELICATE- NEGOTIATIONS THAT HAPPEN ON A COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY BASIS ABOUT WHICH IDENTIFY YOUR WERE USING FOR THAT CHILD- THERE. IS REFERENCE IN THE LEGISLATION TO THE STUDENT SUCCESS THERE IS STUDENT IDENTIFIER NUMBER. AND THAT IS THE NUMBER THAT HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF DATA. THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHILD THAT IS MAINTAINED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THAT DATA AT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T WANT TO HANG ON TO THAT DATA ECAUSE OF FEAR OF CYBER ATTACKS AND BREACHES IN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TOLD US. WE DON'T WANT YOU TO USE THAT INFORMATION SO SOME OF THE DANCE IS WHAT WHAT NUMBER ARE WE GOING TO USE A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE TO USE THE NUMBER THAT FOLLOWS THE CHILD. THROUGH THEIR THEIR CLASS RESIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY IN A NEW SOUND AT THIS TIME YOUR TRIP BECAUSE OF A LOT OF TIMES TIME I AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BURDEN IS ON THE LIBRARY FOR SUCH A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HERE'S A LIST OF STUDENTS BEHALF. AND EAT FIBER MIGHT GO BACK AND SAY WHAT WE NEED WHAT MINIMUM INFORMATION THAT USER LIBRARY WE NEED TO OFFER A CARD. SO WHAT WORK DOESN'T INVOLVE THE LIBRARY TO THEN OFFER A CARD. TO THE LIST OF STUDENTS. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT PROVIDE. YES SEOUL THESE. AND THE LIBRARY MAKE AN AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT DATA THEY'RE GOING TO IMPORT AND THEN THE LIBRARY NEEDS TO IMPORT THAT DATA. AND IN SOME CASES IN SOLANO COUNTY IT TOOK EIGHTY HOURS TO IMPORT THAT DATA INTO THEIR SYSTEM TO CREATE THE NEW LIBRARY CARDS. AND THEN UNDER THIS BILL THERE WOULD BE COLLATERAL INFORMATION AT THE LIBRARY WOULD TAKE TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SAY AND THESE ARE THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT YOU CAN USE. TO ACCESS THOSE CARDS. OKAY AND THEN MONTHLY UPKEEP ON WHAT I WANTED TO TAKE EIGHTY HOURS IZZARD SIMPLYA DATA I. T. ISSUE OR IS IT ACTUALLY. AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON THE UNDER THE LOCAL AGREEMENT. IF THERE WAS A DECISION TO DO OPT OUT OR OPT IN VERY WARM- AND THEY HAVE TO A COLD THE OLD OKAY SOMEBODY'S GOT AN EXISTING CARD VERSUS NOW THIS NEW CAR THE COMPANY ADDED SO DO YOU HAVE TO CHECK FOR DUPLICATION EXAM IVORY HAD A CARD BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER PARENTS SIGN THEM UP FOR ONE CENTER OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SAID THAT AND THEN I GUESS CENTER I'M BURKE TOOK IT AT I KNOW THAN THIS BILL YOU REFER TO THIS IS STUDENT SUCCESS CARD IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STUDENT SUCCESS CARD AND A LIBRARY CARD I JUST TRY IT CLARIFIES THERE. DIDN'T AND BECAUSE YOU'RE CALLING IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN YOUR BILL. IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE ARE THERE EXACTLY THE SAME THING WITH A DIFFERENT NAME. WE'RE NOT WEDDED TO A PARTICULAR TITLE IT'S SIMPLY A- DOCUMENT OR A NUMBER THAT GIVES YOU ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OKAY SO YOUR INTENT IS ESSENTIALLY IT'S A LIBRARY CARD BACK IN OKAY LET ME JUST. SAY I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU EVER SIGNED UP A CHILD OR YOURSELF FOR LIBRARY I WE JUST SIGNED UP OUR GRANDDAUGHTER I DON'T KNOW THREE YEARS AGO IN. WAS VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS BECAUSE YOU'D LOSE YOUR NAME. AND YOUR ADDRESS IS WELL AS THE ADULT SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW IT TOOK QUITE A BIT OF TIME TO FILL OUT. I'M BEING A BIT SARCASTIC AS YOU CAN TELL SO THAT THAT WAS WHAT WAS REQUIRED DIG TO GET A LIBRARY CARD OKAY ALL RIGHT- RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT AND DE DO YOU DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT- HAVING DON'T. TEND THE WORKING WITH MY LOCAL LIBRARIES AND SO FORTH THAT- DEPOSITION I KNOW CENTER CORTESE I ALSO NOTED THIS BILL'S GOING TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE BEFORE GOES APPROPRIATIONS I HOPE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO BETTER ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK THERE'S GONNA E MAYBE A QUESTION ABOUT APPROPRIATIONS WELD GIVE AND- IF THERE'S ADDED ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON TO. LIBRARIES ARE LIBRARIES ARE PRETTY. SHORT HANDED- SO I AND THEN THEN SO HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS THAT AS BEFORE. BILL TO THE FULL BUT I. WHY I DO SHARE YOUR GOAL AND WANT TO SEE. YOU DIVVIED UP TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND- HOPEFULLY WE CAN- NO DEAL ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP SO THAT. WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN MORE UNIVERSALLY ITEMS I KNOW THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS RATE DOING THIS WITH THEIR LIBRARIES THE CHALLENGES THAT THE ONES WHO AREN'T WHY AREN'T THEY DOING IT AND WHAT APPEARS WE HAVE TO TACKLE SO THAT. WE CAN DO IT EFFECTIVELY AND- NOT CNSTRAIN THE LIBRARY OR TO SCHOOL IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO FIGHT OTHER. TO OTHER SERVICES AND LIMITED ACCESS TO OTHER PARTS OF PUBLIC SO THANKS VERY MUCH US IN A BURKE. BIG CENTER PANTS UNDER GLAZER. THANK YOU- CENTER I'M BURKE AT THE LOVE OUR SCHOOLS LOVE OUR LIBRARIES THINK EVERY WITH EVERY KID SHOULD HAVE A LIBRARY CARD SO THOSE ARE ALL EASY YES YES YES FROM FOR ME- WHEN HE DESCRIBED THE BILL THOUGH IT LEFT ME A LITTLE CONFUSE YOU USE LANGUAGE AT THE START THAT SAYS ALLOWS. AND THEN- IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION OR A FEW MOMENTS AGO YOU SAID ENCOURAGES. BUT IS THIS A MANDATE OR NOT A MANDATE YES- THIS IS A- ITWILL ULTIMATELY BE A MANDATE AND WHETHER WE NEED TO APPROPRIATE MONEY WE MAY NEED TO APPROPRIATE MONEY UP TO COOLEY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LIBRARIES CAN'T. ACCOMMODATE THIS- REQUIREMENT IN THE CURRENT BUDGET- AND IT'S A POLICY QUESTION IS A PRIORITY QUESTION DO WE THINK THAT EVERY SCHOOL AGE CHILD SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THESE WONDERFUL INSTITUTIONS THAT MIGHT BE ARE BEING UNDER UTILIZED IN THE STATE OKAY FOR WITH RESPECT THIS IS A MANDATE WOULD ALTER THE BILL'S GOING TO SAY TO MY LIBRARIES I MEAN IS IT TRUE THAT MY LIBRARIES IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT COULD WORK THIS OUT RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THIS BILL IS THAT CORRECT ABSOLUTELY OKAY SO THIS IS FORCING EVERY LIBRARY EVERY SCHOOL TO COMPLY WITH THIS EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD DO THIS RIGHT NOW JUST BY COMMUNICATING BECAUSE- WHO IN THE LIBRARY COMMUNITY WOULDN'T WANT TO ALL THEIR STUDENTS IN THEIR AREA TO HAVE A LIBRARY CARD. AND WHAT SCHOOL WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE ALL THEIR KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO THE ARRAY OF MATERIALS AT A LOCAL LIBRARY RIGHT TO THE END WAS EITHER VERY YEARS WHAT'S WHAT'S CREATING THE NEED FOR THIS MANDATE IS MUCH OF THAT SO WONDERFULLY IT COMES FROM THE HEART AND YOUR SPONSORS IT'S A WONDERFUL THING TO DO BUT WE'LL HAVE WHY IS STATE MANDATE WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO OVERCOME. THE PROBLEM DANCE YOUR QUESTION YES THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LIBRARIES THAT HAVE NOT COME TOGETHER AND US THERE ARE CHILDREN WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO LIBRARIES AS THEY SHOULD- FOR WHATEVER REASON BECAUSE OF A LANGUAGE BARRIER OR BECAUSE OF FOR EXAMPLE A SOME SORT OF A CULTURAL BARRIER IN MY OWN AREA- ESPECIALLY ACUTE DURING THE PANDEMIC IS HIS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET MOST CHILDREN IN MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE HARDWARE BUT SOMETIMES THE INTERNET. CONNECTIVITY DOESN'T EXIST IT DOES EXIST IN LIBRARIES AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAKE IT A PRIORITY WE HAVE TO FUND THAT PRIORITY- OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. HAS ACCESS TO PUBLIC LIBRARY. AND IF WE HAVE TO FOR IT THEN. IT BE MY THAT WOULD BE A PRIORITY AND THAT WE SHOULD APPROPRIATE. THE FUNDS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN OKAY. AND I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT YOU KNOW I HAD TROUBLE FOLLOWING EXACTLY WHAT. THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE COULD YOU BE CLEAR TO US NOW EXACTLY WHAT THE AMENDMENTS YOU ARE ACCEPTING. ON THIS BILL- IT BEGINS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS TO GET YOU GET YOU GO ON BUT. THE- THE- AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE THE AGREEMENT TO FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDE FOR SOME SOURCE OF FUNDING SO THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE ALLOCATION SO THAT DOESN'T REMAIN AMBIGUOUS- I BELIEVE WE ALSO- BUT WHAT HE SAID IN A POSITIVE WHAT IS YOUR BILL DUE TO RESPOND TO THE SAVANNAH. WHAT IS MY BILL DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WHAT IS YOUR BILL DOING TO RESPOND TO THESE A MEMBER REQUEST WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU MANY YOUR BILL TO DO THAT. JUST TO BE CLEAR- CENTER GLAZER I'LL BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU OFFLINE I'LL GO THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS IF YOU WILL- I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY. WHAT THE COPY DOES TO OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BILL BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO OFFLINE. CHECK FOR BECAUSE FOR ME IT- I APPRECIATED THE SSUES THAT WERE RAISED BUT I I'M LEFT WITH A LITTLE CONFUSION IS. IT REGARDING EXACTLY HOW YOU REMAIN IN THE BILL TO DO WHAT I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE DECIDED THAT THIS BILL IS TO DOUBLE REFERS. AND THAT PERHAPS IT HAS A DEAL HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR SOME OF THOSE THINGS UP. BUT I AM TROUBLED THAT OUT OF THIS GOODNESS. OF YOUR HEART AND OTHERS THAT TO HAVE OUR KIDS HAVE LIBRARY CARDS HAVE ACCESS THE SITUATION MATERIAL THAT. WE'RE REALLY. NOT WILL COVER CREATING THIS MANDATE AND YET YOU KNOW. WE'RE KIND OF CALL IT A MANDATE OR KIND AND NOT AND WE'RE NOT REALLY PAYING FOR IT. AND SO OUT OF THIS YOU KNOW GOOD YOUR GOOD OF GOOD DIRECTION I HAVE I'VE WORRIES AND CONCERNS AND I HOPE THAT YOU CAN WORK THEM OUT I'M WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD TODAY TO ALLOW YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY. BUT WHEN YOU WE MAKE THESE KINDS OF STATE MANDATES I THINK WE HAVE TO TRY TO BE. CLEAR THERE WERE OVERCOMING A PROBLEM- NOT NESTLE RELUCTANCE BUT A REAL. AND THINK OF A GOING TO CREATE A MANDATE THAT WE- HAVE TO OWN UP TO IT AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR GOOD HEARTED TAKEN THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- TO HAVE A QUESTION ON THE- SO WE'VE DONE SANTA ANA. IN HAS ALREADY DONE THIS RIGHT CORRECT IT'S BEEN EMPLOYERS THURMOND SANTANA DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA BACK ON LIKE HOW MANY. MORE LIKE. WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF. STUDENTS ACTUALLY ACCESSED AND USED IT AND- THEN DID IT INCREASED TO. STAY THE SAME OR DO YOU HAVE SOME DATE ON THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT ANY OF THIS STUFF I WAS PROVIDED- LET ME REFER TO MR NEVIN. TO SEE IF MISTER NEVINS TO ONLINE APPEARS DATA. MISTER NEVER. ENTERED ALWAYS- THE PROGRAM WAS ONLY FULLY IMPLEMENTED ABOUT THREE AND A HALF TO FOUR MONTHS AGO. SO I CAN CERTAINLY CONNECT YOU AND YOUR STAFF WITH THE- THE HEAD LIBRARIAN BACK. YEAH MANAGES THE DATA AND THE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE LOCAL SANTA ANA PUBLIC LIBRARY AND PROVIDE YOUR STAFF WITH. IN YOUR OFFICE WITH THAT THERE. PERFECT THANK YOU SO I HAVE. ISN'T SORRY I LOOK THIS BILL SO I BUY AS MANY YOU KNOW I SERVED. A VERY LONG TIME ON COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND I WAS AROUND THE DAYS WHEN THEY DE FUNDED LIBRARIES I MEAN. THIS STATE USED TO HELP OUT IN THE STOP AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY. YARDS CELLS WE'VE HAD TO KEEP OUR LIBRARIES OPEN IN OUR RULE COMMUNITIES AND- IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. LIBRARIES ARE CRITICAL TO EDUCATION TO. THE BILL YOU TO READ AND- MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK TO ACCESS TO THE INTERNET EXPECTATIVA FORTY WHERE WE HAVE VERY LIMITED. BROAD AND WE'VE WORKED I KNOW THIS THE LEGISLATORS WORKED ON. A MANY BILLS- AND I'VE PARTICIPATED KNOWS TO GET BROADBAND OUT TO THOSE- RULE COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL EVEN THOUGH WE'VE FUNDED IS IT HASN'T REALLY ENDED UP THERE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR- HOSPITALS IN THE IN THE LIBRARIES. WITH THAT BEING SAID- I HAVE ELEVEN COUNTIES AND I HAVE THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS GEOGRAPHIC WISE IN THE STATE AND MANY OF THESE SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLOSE LIBRARIES OR MAYBE ONE OF THE COUNTY SEAT SO FOR EXAMPLE. BEAVERS SEVENTY FIVE MILES FROM THE COUNTY SEAT THERE'S A LIBRARY THERE WE DO HAVE A LIBRARY IN OUR COMMUNITY- BUT IS STAFFED BY VOLUNTEERS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE SCHOOL THE SCHOOL HAS ACCESS CAN GO OVER TO THE LIBRARY ANYTIME IN THE STUDENTS DO I DID WHEN I WAS THERE- BUT TO MANDATE THE SCHOOL HOW WOULD IT WORK OUT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR VISION FOR THIS. IN THESE VERY RULE COMMUNITIES WHERE IN MANY CASES THERE IS NO LIBRARY EXCEPT FOR IF THERE IS ONE IT MAY BE- LITERALLY. OVER FIFTY MILES AWAY. SENATE DOLLY I WOULD EXPECT IF THERE'S NO LIBRARY WITHIN FIFTY MILE RADIUS THAT- IN TERMS OF THE PARENTS INTEREST IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT INTERESTED IN PROVIDING SOME SORT OF ACCESS THAT THEY WOULD WORK IT OUT WHERE ONE WOULD HAVE A CARD AND PEOPLE WANT TO TRAVEL THAT FIFTY MILES THEY THEY CAN DO SO OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T REQUIRE THIS DEVILISH MINIMAL LIBRARY JUST PROVIDES THAT. IF A LIBER EXISTED THAT SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO LIVE LIBRARY. AUGUST I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK IF WE REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT HELPS. STUDENTS GET A LIBRARIES WE WOULD HELP FUND LIBRARY SO THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS TO GO TO IN IN MY CASE IRAN ARE COUNTIES CASES- I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S VERY LITTLE ACCESS- JUST BECAUSE THERE'S REAP REALLY A LACK OF FUNDING. AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY. SIR I'M BURKE BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE I HAVE A COUPLE COMMON TO MY OWN. FIRST I WOULD SAY I WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO LOVES LIBRARIES MORE THAN IDEAL. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL I GOT TO GO MY FIRST TIME IN KINDERGARTEN AND I WENT ALL THROUGHOUT MY- GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS AND I ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS SUCH A PRIVILEGE. TO GET TO GO AND CHECK OUT A BOOK OR MY PARENTS COULDN'T AFFORD ENCYCLOPEDIAS AT THE TIME- WE NOW USE THE INTERNET. AND TO GET TO GO AND USE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA'S- FOR ME IT WAS SOMEWHAT LIFE CHANGING SO WHEN I SAW YOUR BILL I WAS VERY EXCITED. BUT THEN WHEN I SAW THAT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WAS IN OPPOSITION I THOUGHT. THIS KIND OF RAISES A RED FLAG FOR ME. AND I THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT I KNOW SPEAKING FOR ONLY MY TO MY- LIBRARIES IN MY SCHOOL MY DISTRICT. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AND YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED TO FIND FUNDING TO SEND DOLLARS POINT OF WORK TO FIND FUNDING FOR MY LIBRARY SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED. MANY OF THEM HAVE PART TIME STAFF VERY PART TIME STAFF SO THE EXTRA TIME THEY NEED TO. TO MAKE THE LIBRARY CARDS WHAT SEEMS EASY TO US. WE REALLY BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM- I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. I DON'T LIKE TO KILL BILLS IN THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE- AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH LAN. WE WANT TO TRY TO DO THE BEST WE COULD TO MAKE SURE WE COULD. COME TO A RESOLUTION WHERE- THE BILL MOVES FORWARD SO OF COURSE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. HE WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND YOU KNOW UNFUNDED MANDATE AS SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT UNTIL I CAME% HERE TO SACRAMENTO.
