00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.450
THAT THEIR PPVS PUT INTO PLACE --

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.286
LIMITS THAT WHEN A ABOUT MAJOR

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:14.553
COMMITTEE DOES FEATURE CANADA AT

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.621
THE BEHEST OF THE CANDIDATE THAT

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:16.489
THEN.

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.424
THE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS START TO

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:23.029
KICK IN AFTERWARDS -- BUT THAT'S

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:23.663
THE ONLY ONE THAT I'M AWARE OF

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.464
RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE US SENATOR

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.099

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.903
CONTRIBUTION. TO YOUR CAMPAIGN

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.271
AND WILL YOU KNOW WE'RE LIMITED

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:33.606
ON OUT SO.

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.641
THAT'S PROBABLY HOUSE CONTROL

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.510
MAYBE INDIRECTLY.

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:38.611
I WOULD ASSUME BECAUSE IT'S AN

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.613
IN KIND CONTRIBUTION WHEN

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.113
THEY'RE PROMOTING YOU.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.214
RIGHT.

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.684
SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY COMMON

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.952
CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.486
BALLOT MEASURE AND THEY FEATURED

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:49.288
A PARTICULAR ELECTED OFFICIAL

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.556

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.528
IN KIND CONTRIBUTION.

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:56.762
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:09:56.829 --> 00:10:00.766
REPORT THAT I AM NOT THE MVPS.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.601
DECIDER ON THAT BALLOT MY GUESS

COMMITTEE THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.114

CONNECTION OR MY CONSULTANTS.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:23.589
THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.558
TOTAL REVIEW OF WHAT MY

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.693

COURSE THE CONTEXT DEPENDS ON

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:57.623
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S EXPRESS

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.891

ASIDE THAT A CANDIDATE CONTROL

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:24.803
BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.306
ACTUALLY BECOMES BASICALLY THE

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.707

THINK OF A CASE BUT IF THAT WAS

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:44.089
TO OCCUR -- THERE WOULD BE -- A

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.791
NUMBER OF ISSUES FOR THAT

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.626

ABOVE THE LIMITS.

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:57.736

PROMOTE THEMSELVES FOR THEIR

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:00.673
REELECTION USING EXPRESS

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.908
ADVOCACY -- WE WOULD CONSIDER

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:04.510
THAT A VIOLATION OF THE

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.312
EXPENDITURE RULES THAT WE HAVE

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:06.946

AND THEN WE WOULD ESSENTIALLY --

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:16.388
WE MAY LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.289
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE NOT

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.891
SUBJECT TO LIMIT NOW SUBJECT TO

WOMEN AND LOOK AT THE SPENDING.

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:23.095

SOME SCRUTINY -- BUT I THINK

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:45.684
THERE'S A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:51.156

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:10.115
THE NEWPORT BEACH CITY COUNCIL

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.083
KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:12.484

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.300
AND A LESS WELL ORGANIZED GROUP

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.801
THE LOSS OF NINE DAYS TO PRINT

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.303
THE PETITIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.337
FATAL.

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:34.973
IN A LESS AFFLUENT CITY THE

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.607

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:36.708
OF THE PETITIONS WERE SHUT DOWN

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:38.210
THE EFFORT IMMEDIATELY.

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:41.079
THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:42.954
RECEIVES MORE THAN 50% -- BASED

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:43.955
ON PEOPLE SECOND AND THIRD

00:28:44.022 --> 00:28:47.292
CHOICE AND SO ON VOTES SO WE

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.159
HAVE RANGERS VOTING IN A NUMBER

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:48.793
CITIES AFTER MUNICIPAL ELECTION

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.462
SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND BERKELEY

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:51.463

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:02.540
IT JUST SAYS THEY CAN USE THIS

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:05.944
