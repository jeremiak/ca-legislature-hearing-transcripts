BUT WE STILL THAT ARE ALL AWARE OF HOW CRITICAL THE CENSUS IS THE CALIFORNIA. AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR THESE NUMBERS BUT I THINK ILLUSTRATES THAT THE PICTURE. WELL. FOR EVERY PERSON UNDERCOUNTED CALIFORNIA LOSES TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON PER YEAR. AND FACT INTO ANY FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED ABOUT SEVENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND FEDERAL FUNDS BASED OFF THE POPULATION COUNT. FUNDS THAT WENT TO HEALTH CARE TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION OTHER. SERVICES. SO TEMPORE THAT EVERYONE DISCOUNTED NOT ONLY FOR THE FINANCIAL SECURITY BUT ALSO THAT SHARED A PLACE IN HISTORY. TODAY WE HOPE TO GET AN OVERVIEW OF THE CENSUS AND THE DIFFERENT ROLES EVERYONE PLACE AND HELP ENSURE AND ACCURATE COMPLETE COUNT. THIS UPCOMING CENSUS WILL BE PARTICULARLY MORE CHALLENGING IN PREVIOUS YEARS SO WE WANT TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW WE COMPARE FOR THOSE BEARS IN ADVANCE. OBVIOUSLY THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF TODAY'S HEARING BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. I'LL WE HAVE A GREAT LINE UP FOR YOU TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM ANY EXPERIENCE A KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN PAST CENSUSES ARE PREPARING FOR THE ONE AHEAD. THEY WILL SHARE THEIR LESSONS BEST PRACTICES IN WAYS WE CAN'T PARRIS SELVES WERE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS AND WHAT THINK ALL OUR SPEAKERS FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF.

THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE AND I NOW INVITE MY CO CHAIR SOMEWHERE BERMAN TO MAKE HIS OPENING REMARKS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR PAN. THEN THINK YOU EVER WANT IT TO COMING TO PARTICIPATE IS AS SPEAKER IS. JUST TO LISTEN TO TODAY'S TESTIMONY I COULD BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THAT OUR JOINT. HEARING OF OUR BOTH BOTH OF OUR THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEES ON THE CENSUS. ABOUT USUALLY WHEN YOU CREATE A SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE BAG YOUR COLLEAGUES TO PARTICIPATE. AND THIS TIME WE ACTUALLY TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY AT LEAST ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE. THAN WE HAD SLOTS AND I ACTUALLY HAD TO GO ASK THE SPEAKER FOR GETTING CHRIS THE NUMBER OF SPOTS ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO WHICH SHE E. SAID NO. WHICH IT WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER THINK TO KEEP IT SMALL AND AND SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET GOOD WORK DONE BUT I THINK THAT'S JUST AN INDICATION OF HOW MUCH INTEREST THERE IS MUCH ANXIETY THERE IS. AROUND THE CENSUS BOTH IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES BACK HOME SO THE SELECT COMMITTEES ARE GONNA PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. IN. BRINGING INFORMATION UP FROM ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT WE CAN THEN PASS ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND THE STATE. COMPLETE COUNTS COMMITTEE AND ALSO. KEEPING TRACK OF THE EFFORTS OF THE COMPLETE ACCOUNT COMMITTEE MISTAKENLY CAO COMMITTEE AND AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDING. TO. CONDUCT A ROBUST OUR REGION COMMUNICATION EFFORT. IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE. WE ALWAYS HAVE AN UNDERCOUNT IN THE CENSUS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A HISTORIC THING CALIFORNIA UNDER CAO IF SOME THE MOST YEAH HARD TO COUNT COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY INCLUDING. LA COUNTY WHICH IS THE HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY BUT THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT NOW. WITH THE ANXIETY AND FEAR IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AROUND THAT EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IT'S THAT IMPORTANT THAT WE TRIPLE OUR EFFORTS THAT WERE IS COORDINATED AS POSSIBLE THAT WE GET. EXPERTS TO COME IN AND GIVE US ADVICE ON PAST PRACTICE WHAT WORKED AND WHAT HASN'T OF AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA GETS COUNTED EVERY EVERY RESIDENT. IN CALIFORNIA GETS COUNTED. SO WITH THAT I'LL INTRODUCE. ARE OPEN OUR FIRST GUEST. WERE ESPECIALLY HONORED TO WELCOME FORMER CENSUS DIRECTOR VINCE BERAPA. TO OPEN THIS JOINT SPECIAL HEARING ON PREPARING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. I CANNOT THINK OF ANYONE WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE IN THIS FIELD WHO WANTS TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS. DIRECTOR BROUGH HAS COMPILED A LONG AND ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER SERVING A VARIETY OF BUSINESS POLITICAL AND PUBLIC SERVICE POSITIONS. FOR OUR PURPOSES TODAY IT IS HIS DISTINCTION OF RECEIVING APPOINTMENTS BY PRESIDENTS OF DIFFERENT PARTIES TO THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF U. S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS. DURING WHICH TIME HE PRESIDED OVER THE NINETEEN EIGHTY CENSUS SOME OF YOU MAY ALSO KNOWN AS A MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WHETHER TWENTY TEN CENSUS DATA WAS THE FOUNDATION OF ITS DECISION MAKING. ITS MY SPECIAL PLEASURE TO INVITE DIRECTOR OF VINCE BRAVO TO SHARE HIS WEALTH OF INSIGHTS WITH US TODAY THANKS SO MUCH MAKE YOU. YOU HAVE IRA HEADFIRST SLIDE GAVE THE. NOT THAT MY PERSONAL HISTORY THE BUREAU I'VE I WAS THE USER. AND MY WIFE MADE MIGHT BE MAKE IT VERY HOUSE THE USER OF CENSUS DATA NOT USER OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT. FROM NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR DO I SEVENTY TWO BECAUSE I DID THEY HAVE. A LOT OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGN WORKING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I PM A PUSHER AYE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND SEVENTY SIX AND SEVENTY NINE EIGHTY ONE. AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENSUS BUREAU. THE PUSH YOUR YET AGAIN OF FACT THIS DATA HAD THAT. AND THE GUY AND THEN I BECAME A USER AGAIN I BECAME ADDICTED. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HIGH TO TWO THOUSAND TEN. THAT WE WERE INVOLVED WITH THEY'VE BUSINESS THAT STRATEGIES IN FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS. THEN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. AT ANY KILL NOW I WAS A COMMISSIONER ON THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. BUT SADLY THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT DATA THAT WERE AND THAT WAS ASSN THAT WAS THE. HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF REGARDING THE CENSUS. AND. Y. DEFENSE IS IMPORTANT FOR WHAT SHE IS STILL. LET ME START WITH THE FIRST TWO. NEXT LIGHT DERRIERE. I KNOW YOU CAN'T BE DEBT SO I HAVE TO READ IT TO YOU. SO EVEN COUNTY OUR ENTIRE ENTIRE POPULATION AND USING THE CENSUS OF INHABITANTS. NOT CITIZENS BUT INHABITANTS FOR A LONG TIME THIS LETTER CAME FROM THE POSTMASTER GENERAL. WRITTEN IN SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE. IT SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE IF THERE BE ANY SPARE COPIES OF THE CENSUS OF INHABITANTS OF THE STATE'S. IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THE POSTMASTER GENERAL REQUEST MISTER JEFFERSON TO FAVOR HIM WITH ONE. IT BEING PROPER TO ATTEND TO THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY. IN FORMING AN OPINION UPON THE APPLICATION OF NEW POSTSCRIPT. THAT WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE. SO ADDITION ALLOCATING SEATS IN CONGRESS WE EVEN HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON HER POST OFFICE. BRINKLEY. FIXED THERE. SO MAKING SURE EVERYONE IS COUNTED IS REALLY A VERY DIFFICULT TASK CRITICALLY AS IT RELATES TO HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS. THAT AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE INFORMATION WILL BE USED. AND I'M GLAD THAT THE GOVERNOR AND IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE UNDERTAKEN AN OUTREACH TO AND EDUCATION PROGRAM. TO HELP THE SENSE THAT SIXTY. I'VE HAD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THE REACHING OUT AND COMMUNICATING WITH WITH HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES. BOTH TIMES THAT I RAN THE SENATE THAT'S NEW HERE'S WHAT WE DID IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WE CREATED THE FIRST MINORITY STATUS ADVISORY COMMITTEES. PRIOR TO DOING SO JACK INGRAM ONE OF THE BUREAUS AFRICAN AMERICANS SUGGESTED TO ME THAT IF WE DON'T GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. THE IMPACT OF THE COMMITTEES ON THE COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO REACH OUT TO. WOULD BE OF LITTLE VALUE. WE STARTED THIS EFFORT BY REACHING OUT TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THE FIRST PERSON WE ASKED TO JOIN THE COMMITTEE WAS BOBBY SEALE. OF THE BLACK PANTHERS. BUT FIRST WE HAD TO LOCATED. WHICH PROVED TO BE QUITE A TASK. WE EVENTUALLY REACHED HIM THROUGH FIVE INTERMEDIARIES. AND ONCE HE AGREED TO ATTEND A MEETING DEFORMED THE COMMITTEE. WE MANAGED TO BRING TOGETHER A VERY REPRESENTATIVE GROUP OF AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS COVERING THE FULL RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES. FROM THE AND DOUBLE ACP TO THE URBAN LEAGUE STILL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS. AND ACADEMICS. NEXT I. WHEN YOU'RE CREATING AN OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO BE SURE YOU'RE IDENTIFYING REAL COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO CAN CARRY THE MESSAGE. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SENSES TO THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. LET ME TELL YOU A STORY. AB DULY OUT SHIP OZ WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MEMBERS OF THE BLACK ADVISORY COMMITTEE. DOCTOR SURVIVES PARTICIPATED ACTIVELY AND ADVISORY COMMITTEE. BARRY MEMBER HIM MOST. FOR HOW HE INTENTLY LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES OF ANY DISCUSSION. AND WHEN HE SPOKE IT WAS NO QUESTION HIT. THOUGHT THROUGH EVERY WORD. I WOULD APPRECIATE HOW WELL HE WAS LISTENING WHEN WE TURN TO THE SET WHEN I RETURNED THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. THAT YEAR HE ARRANGED FOR ME TO VISIT WITH WALLACE DEAN MUHAMMAD. AT THE MUSLIM MOSQUE IN CHICAGO SENT OUTSIDE. HERE'S MY TWO OF MY COUSINS CHICAGO IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THE SOUTH SIDE AND STONE UP. BUT WE WENT. AND. WHEN WE ARRIVED I WAS ESCORTED INTO THE MASKING WITHIN MINUTES IMAM MUHAMMAD AWRY. I PLAN TO PRESENT HIM WITH THE REASONING BEHIND OUR REQUEST FOR THE MONTH SINCE THE COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE EIGHTY CENTS IS REVERSING THEIR DECISION. NOT TO PARTICIPATE. AS THEY HAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. BEFORE I COULD START. IMAM MUHAMMAD BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY POINTING OUT. THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A VERY POSITIVE REPORT. AND OUR PROCEDURES AND OUR INTENT FROM DOCTOR ZHIVAGO. IN HE HAD DIRECTED HIS LEADERSHIP CAME TO COMMUNICATE TO THE MEMBERSHIP. THAT THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY SHOULD PARTICIPATE. HE POINTED OUT THAT WOULD USE THE MUSLIM SCHOOL SYSTEM AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF COMMUNICATION. THE WHOLE MEETING TOOK ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. IT WAS CLEAR REALIZE THAT DOCTOR SHE ADVISED HIM NOT ONLY LISTEN WELL. BUT IT TAKEN FULL MEASURE OF WHAT WAS SAID. AND PROMISED BY THE CENSUS BUREAU AND THEN CONVEYED HIS REASON. A REASONABLE POINT OF VIEW TO THE MUSLIM LEADERSHIP. JACK INGRAM WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT WE GET PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE WITH CREDIBLE REPUTATIONS. HE MUST'VE BEEN THINKING OF PEOPLE LIKE DR SHABAZZ. IT AND ITS MY ADVICE THAT IT ALL OF CALIFORNIA CENTER THOUGHT REACH. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU FIVE MAY DR SHABAZZ'S AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. NOW. THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN THIS THAT MESSAGE OUT. ROBERT MERTON MAKES THE OBSERVATION AND SERVICES THE POTENTIAL. THAT ONE INCORRECT SITUATIONS ARE PERCEIVED BY PEOPLE AS REAL. THEY ARE REAL IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES. SO TODAY IF US CITIZENS THOSE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY. ARE FROM MINORITY GROUPS PROCEED PIXIE THAT THE CLAIM. THAT BY FILLING OUT THE CENSUS FORM THEY WILL BE PLACING THEMSELVES IN DANGER. THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO FILL OUT THE FORM AND THEREFORE NOT BE COUNTED. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A REAL DANGER OF PEOPLE NOT FILLING OUT THE CENSUS FORM. AND THAT'S WHY SPENDING MONEY ON EDUCATION PROGRAM. IN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IN THIS CASE THE PERCEPTION OF POSSIBLE DIRECT HARM. BY FILLING OUT THE FORM IS NOT CORRECT. IT'S NOT CORRECT BECAUSE IT IS AGAINST THE LAW OF TITLE THIRTEEN OF U. S. CARD. FOR ANY CENSUS BUREAU EMPLOYEE TO DISCLOSE OR PUBLISH ANY SENSE IT'S OUR SURVEY INFORMATION. THAT IDENTIFIES THE INDIVIDUAL OR BUSINESS. SO ALTHOUGH I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE ADDED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. IF IT IS ADDED. IS IMPORTANT TO CORRECTIVE PERCEPTION THAT THE INDIVIDUALS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO OTHER AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT. WHO MIGHT CAUSE THEM HARM? AND ENCOURAGE ALL INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED. THE STATE WILL NEED A PROGRAM TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT TITLE THIRTEEN. AND BE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT TITLE THIRTEEN PROTECTS THEM. FOR THEY WILL BE COUNTED AND I WILL NOW PROVIDE TWO EXAMPLES. BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE. HE DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SENSE THE PEROT. CAN KEEP ITS PROMISE. AND WEDNESDAY AUGUST THIRTEENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FBI AGENTS ARRIVED THAT THE DISTRICT OFFICE IN COLORADO SPRINGS. ARMED WITH A SEARCH WARRANT. BUT THE WRITING THEM TO SEIZE SENSES DOCUMENTS. INCLUDING COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES. IN THE COURSE OF THEIR LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION. OF A CASE INVOLVING ALLEGED QUESTIONNAIRE FALSIFICATION. AND PAYROLL FRAUD. I WAS IMMEDIATELY INFORMED OF THE SITUATION. RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS SITUATION WHICH BOTH THE FBI. AND THE AND THE CENSUS BUREAU HAVE HAD STUMBLED ON. AND I'VE REACHED THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI WITH HAVING. DINNER AT A RESTAURANT. AFTER SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS TO EMPLOYEES IN COLORADO. WE AGREED A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION. THAT ALLOW THE FBI TO PROCEED WHILE THE DISPUTED QUESTIONS REMAIN. IN THE CUSTODY OF THE CENSUS BUREAU. ULTIMATELY THE DOCUMENTS REPLACE IN A SECURE ROOM PROTECTED BY TWO LOCKS. WHEN HE HELD BY THE FBI AND THE OTHER BY LOCAL CENSUS OFFICIALS. UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT ONLY SWORN CENSUS EMPLOYEES WERE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE ROOM. BUT AN FBI AGENT HAD TO BE PRESENT WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN TO MAKE SURE. THAT APPROPRIATE PEOPLE ENTERED. WHEN THE DOOR WAS LOCKED IN AGENT WAS THAT STATIONED OUTSIDE THE ROOM TO MAKE SURE UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL. DID NOT ENTER THE ROOM. THE CENSUS BUREAU BROUGHT THAT IN HAY. EXPERIENCE ENUMERATOR SOME OUTSIDE OF THE DENVER AREA. TO RE INTERVIEW THE RESPONDENTS IN THE AREA WHERE THEY ALLEGE FRAUD HAD TAKEN PLACE. AND THEY DID A HEY WE CAMPUS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THEN COMPARED THAT THE CAMPUS TO THE. BUT WAS SAID BROUGHT IN AS A PROBLEM IDEA. I THE FBI. AND IT WAS ALL RESOLVED. UNDER TITLE THIRTEEN EVEN THE ADDRESS LIST USED TO BE OF THE SENSES ARE CONFIDENTIAL. IN THE LITIGATION THAT FOLLOWED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY CENSUS THE CITY OF NEW YORK. OBTAINED A DISTRICT COURT ORDER REQUIRING THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS TURNED OVER ITS ADDRESS REGISTERS FOR THE CITY. SO THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS MIGHT COMPARE THE LISTINGS WITH THEIR OWN RECORDS. BECAUSE OF THE LAWSUIT. WE WERE UNDER A COURT ORDER NOT TO DELIVER THE CENSUS RESULTS TO THE PRESIDENT. THANKS THE JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL. I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL LATE THE EVENING OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. INDICATING THE JUSTICE IT STAY THE RULING. AND THE NEXT MORNING THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE AND I FORWARDED THE CENSUS RESULTS PRESIDENT. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE CASE WITHOUT ME REACHED THE US SUPREME COURT. SHE CITED IN THE CENSUS BUREAU'S FAVOR. ADDRESS LIST COULD NOT BE DISCLOSED HERE TO SETTLE CIVIL DISCUSS FOR DISCOVERY. ARE UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. I FELT A FEW MORE MINUTES AND I. DEPENDING AT TIME MAKE IT. GO EAST GO AHEAD OKAY. IT IF WE CAN HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. YEAH. YOU TOOK MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS DUE PROCESS THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY COW A FIFTY MILLION AMERICANS. GIVEN THAT THE RATE OF GROWTH WAS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE CRITICALLY BECAUSE OF INCREASED IMMIGRATION. THE BUREAU IS CONCERNED THAT THE NIGHT EIGHTEEN NINETY COUNT. MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL AFTER THE NINETEEN HUNDRED STARTED. THE CENSUS BUREAU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE COUNTY MACHINE RECENTLY INVENTED BY HERMAN HOLLERITH AS CENSUS EMPLOYEE AT THE TIME. THAT USE SPECIALLY ENCODED PUNCH CARDS. EACH REPRESENTING AN INDIVIDUAL CENSUS DATA. HOW RICH DEVICE REVOLUTIONIZE CENSUS TABULATION? THE EIGHTEEN NINETY COUNT OF SIXTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE WAS COMPLETED IN LESS THAN A YEAR. EVEN THOUGH SENSE IF INCLUDED THREE TIMES AS MANY QUESTIONS AND ANOTHER THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. THAT IMPROVEMENT IN TIME TO COUNT WAS IMPRESSIVE. BUT THE WAY THE INFORMATION WAS USED ADDS EVEN MORE TO THE STORY. I COUNTY THIRTEEN MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME. THE CENSUS BUREAU WAS ABLE TO RELEASE CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED INFORMATION. THAT BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES TO CONGRESS TO INCREASE FROM THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX. AMONG THE FASTEST GROWING STATES AT THAT TIME. NEBRASKA ADDED THREE REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT% PENNSYLVANIA TEXAS MINNESOTA AND ILLINOIS. EACH ADDED TO. IF THE SET FIFTY INCREASE SPEED OF THE COUNT FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY HADN'T BEEN POSSIBLE. THE CITIZENS OF THOSE GROWING STATES WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER REPRESENTED IN CONGRESS. FOR SEVEN YEARS ARE MARK. NEXT RIGHT HAND NIGHT JULY OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. VICE PRESIDENT ROCKEFELLER VISIT THE CENSUS BUREAU TO SERVE AS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER. AT A CEREMONY COMMEMORATING THE TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PERILS IN CIVIC INFLATION. OF THE UNIVAC ONE THE WORLD'S FIRST COMMERCIAL ELECTRONIC COMPUTER. ALSO IN ATTENDANCE REDUCTION JOHN MOXLEY NJ PRESS PER ACCURATE. THE INVENTORS OF THE UNIVAC. AMONG THE ARTIFACTS ON DISPLAY WITH THE MEMORY STORAGE UNIT ROUGHLY THIRTY SIX INCHES LONG. AND EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER. VICE PRESIDENT ROCKEFELLER ALWAYS VERY INTERESTED PERSON. S. MOTLEY INACCURATE. HOW BIG AN EQUIVALENT STORAGE DEVICE WOULD BE IN USING CURRENT TECHNOLOGY? THE TO THE INVENTORS PAUSE FIVE A SECOND OR TWO AND THEN REPLIED. MR VICE PRESIDENT IT WOULD BE SO SMALL YOU COULD NOT SEE IT. AND THIS WAS THE FIRST COMMERCIAL COMPUTER AND I THINK IT WAS USED FOR IT AND IT WAS USED FOR THE CENSUS. FASCINATED THINK ABOUT THE EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT JUST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETY A LOT IS CHANGING THE WORLD OF DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING. FOR EXAMPLE THANKS A DEDICATED WORKERS THAT THE COMPUTER AT THE STATUES PARA. PHOTO OPTICAL SCANNING DEVICES AND UNIVAC ELEVEN TEN. COMPUTER I WAS ABLE TO DELIVER A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DETAILED. AND ACCURATE COUNT OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIVE PEOPLE TO THE PRESIDENT. BY JANUARY FIRST NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. NINE MONTHS. AFTER THE BUREAU SENT OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRES IN APRIL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY. THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA. AND MOBILE DEVICES. WHICH IN TURN HAVE ALTERED THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH BUSINESS GOVERNMENTS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR DEMAND THAT WE IN FACT REINVENT THE PROCESS WE USE IN THE PAST. AND THAT IS WHAT THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS ATTEMPTED TO DO FOR TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. BUT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT IS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. S. IMPOSED UNTESTED QUESTIONS AND PROCEDURES AND HOW THE CENSUS WILL BE CONDUCTED. ONCE AGAIN IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA LEAD THE WAY TO A SUCCESSFUL CENSUS. AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT SPEAK LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. IN CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE TO BE SURE EVERY CALIFORNIA. DISCOUNT DIDN'T TWENTY SET THIS AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT. THE THE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE STATEWIDE DATABASE. S. CONTINUED BE FULLY FUNDED. AND STAFF PROPERLY. THAT WAS ONE OF THE REALLY GREAT BENEFITS THEY'RE REDISTRICTING COMMISSION HAVING THAT. ACCESS TO THAT DATA AVAILABLE. WELL THAT'S A BRIEF SUMMARY AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO CAN'T CAN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER BROUGH REALLY APPRECIATE. THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN A COUPLE OF CASES THAT I WASN'T AWARE OF I WANNA OPEN UP MY COLLEAGUES. MISTER JONES SAWYER. THOUGHT THAT SHOW IT WAS THANK YOU FOR THE HISTORICAL. RESPECTED I HAVE LIKE SO HOPEFULLY TWO QUICK QUESTIONS. BECAUSE I AYE MY DISTRICT FIFTY NOT DISSIMILAR SOUTH LA HATCHED SOME OF THE PORCH. NUMBERS SHOWING AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF WE GO BACK AND DO THE SAME THING AGAIN SO I'M WHAT I'M. PROGRESS IN THE YOUNG FOLKS DON'T REMEMBER OF LIKE GOING TO THE NATION OF ISLAM AND LISTENING TO HELP OR GOING TO BOBBY SEALE THE BLACK PANTHERS.% WAS OUT OF THE BOX. AND. AND I THINK WE GOT TO DO SOME THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF THE BOX TO GET. PEOPLE MY COMMUNITY FULLY ARM AND GET INVOLVED AND AMBIENCE WITH YOU THAT THAT MAY INVOLVE SOME FOOD SOME MUSIC THEY MAY INVOLVED IN THINGS THAT YOU WOULDN'T TRADITIONALLY. DO SITE CONTA WHEN THEY KNOW HOW. DID YOU. AND BACK THEN YOU PROBLEMS MIDDLE AYE RESISTANCE TO DO IT ARTS SO I'D WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT AND INTO I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECURITY. OF THE INFORMATION BECAUSE IF I I WILL TELL RIGHT NOW JUST GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND YOU ON ON. KEEPING THE INFORMATION FROM THE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES. IF A BLACK YOURS BECAUSE YOU YOU WILL NOT GET THE SAME ANSWER THAT YOU GOT FROM THURGOOD MARSHALL I GUARANTEE YOU THAT. AND SO IN MY COMMUNITY THEIR LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED AND I COULD HAVE A REALLY DETRIMENTAL IMPACT. IF I CAN'T. TELL THEM WITH SOME SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE RECORDS WOULDN'T BE USED OR ABUSED. TO TO SEPARATE FAMILIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO. THE TO SOMEONE HOW DID YOU BREAK OUT OF THE BOX AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN KILL USED THAT'S ALL I CAN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN AND TO. DEBT THAT THE SECURITY OF THIS INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WELL A HE GETTING BACK THE SALE WAS THEIR REAL INTERESTING AND I EXERCISE. HE CLEARED HIS ADMINISTRATION LED BY RICHARD NIXON. TO ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND SO WHEN HE CAME WE HAD THIS MEETING. AND AND THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT GOING WELL. AB IT'S CLEAR THAT EVERYBODY WAS NOT CONFIDENT THAT THEY COULD TRUST THIS SAID THE CENSUS BUREAU TO KEEP ALL THE THINGS THEY WERE SAYING. SO BOBBY SEE IF THE. CAN WE TAKE A BREAK AND. NICE IT CAN WE SEPARATE SO THAT WE COULD TALK TO OURSELVES. AND I SAID NO AND A PUBLIC HEARING. SIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT SOMEBODY FROM THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE HERE. THEY SAID CAN WE TAKE A BREAK. I SAID YEAH SAYS THAT WHAT YOU TAKE YOUR BREAK OUT THERE WILL TAKE A BREAK. BUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER THE BREAK WAS OVER. AND THAT IF WE CAME BACK AND HE SAID WELL WE DECIDED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE. AND THE ONLY REASON WE GIVEN YOUR CHANCES BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO IT WE'RE GOING TO REALLY THEY'LL EAT IT ACROSS THE. AND. AT IT BUT IT WAS TAKE IT TOOK SOMEBODY LIKE HIM TO GIVE VINCE PEOPLE WHO WERE NERVOUS ABOUT IT. THEY SAY HEY YOU KNOW THIS IS WORTH TRYING. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T TRY WE'RE GOING TO GET HURT ANYWAY IT WHAT'S MORTGAGE ABOUT THE NIXON GOVERNMENT DAN AT. WELL I COULD TELL YOU NOBODY IN THAT GOVERNMENT SAW THE INFORMATION. WHO HAD AND THAT I COULD TELL YOU THAT WHAT WHAT YOU HAD A SUPREME COURT JUDGE THAT GREW OUT OF QUOTING WHAT YOU SAID KINDA RULED ANYA FELL OUT AND THEY DO HAVE A TICKET THEY WOULD HAVE TO VIOLATE THE LAW AND WHAT THE JUDGE WAS SAYING AS THE? LAW STANDS. AGAIN WHAT I'M SAYING IS THIS SUPREME COURT MAY SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. EL AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. AT I WOULD BE A QUIET DAY I WOULD BE FRANKLY STARTLED IF THEY DID BECAUSE IT'S SO CLEAR. THAT YOU CAN A IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE IN THAT SENSE. AND OUT NOW. WILL THERE BE ATTEMPTS. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED BUT I GOT TO A AND. PRETTY MUCH AS I HAD TO DO WITH THE DIRECTOR FOR THE FBI IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. IT WILL BE IN THOSE ATTEMPTS WILL BE THWARTED. MY HOPE SO BUT THE EMPLOYEES OF THE BUREAU. IF I INVITE WHERE MY GUESS IS THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT RESIGNATIONS IF THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY BIG EVENT IT'S. THANK YOU. BARBARA FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AT A QUESTION SO WE'RE HERE OF COURSE AS THE. TELL YOU ALL THAT INFORMATION HEARING FOR THE. STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF SEAT TO US CENSUS IS RUN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE ARE CONFLICTS WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. HOW DO YOU SEE WHAT'S THE WORST THINGS THAT WE AS A STATE CAN DO TO HELP? BOOST THE CENSUS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE MAY HAVE WELL TO CERTAIN GRAY THINK WHERE COOPERATION TO SOME DEGREE THERE WE MAY HAVE TO DEAL THERE THEY MAY NOT COOPERATE GREAT. SO FEEBLE WE'RE HEARING THAT INCIDENT WAS IT SIX FOLLOW UP CAN ONLY DO THREE FOLLOW UP SO. WE CAN'T ADD MORE FOLLOW UP SO I DON'T KNOW BUT WHERE THINGS WE CAN DO IS A STATE. TO. IN THE FACE OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY RUNNING THE CENSUS COUNT ITSELF. TO TRY TO INCREASE THE COUNT. WHY? WELL BASICALLY INTERFACING WITH A SYSTEM THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WANT TO BE COOPERATIVE WITH OUR EFFORTS SO IT WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IRAN THE U. S. SUCH AS. WELL. I WOULD SAY THAT THOUGH YOU. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND. AS A CITIZEN SHARE YOUR CONCERN. THE. THE EMPLOYEES OF THE BUREAU ONE ACCOUNT EVERYONE. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. AND THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN WITHIN THE RULES THAT ARE PLACED UPON THEM. TO DO THAT AND ONE OF THE RULES SAYS THEY SHALL NOT VIOLATE TITLE THIRTEEN OF THE U. S. CODE. SO I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE STARTED HERE IN THE STATE WHICH IS AN OUTREACH PROGRAM. GOES WELL BEYOND WHAT THE CENSUS BUREAU COULD AFFORD TO DO. AND IT'S PROBABLY. CONSIDERED MARK SEPT ABOVE BY THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE. ISSUE HAVING CALIFORNIANS ASCHAM TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE IT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIANS. I AND IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE WHEN YOUR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE TIGHTLY DIFFERENT SET OF. ISSUES THEN YOU RENDON'S THEN SOUTH PART OF LOS ANGELES HER UP IN HAVE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE ARE THE BAY AREA. SO. HAVING THE. THE OUTREACH PROGRAM THAT YOU STARTED. FUNDED PROPERLY. AND THEN BUT THE BACKGROUND OF FINDING THE RIGHT PEOPLE FINING THE LANI SHABAZZ'S OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. IN MY MIND WHO IS PROBABLY THE MOST MEANINGFUL THING YOU CAN DO. AND THAT THIS WILL NOT BE INEXPENSIVE THAT I IT WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE. TO DO THAT AND THAT THE OTHER THING I WOULD DE SUGGESTS IS THE. MAKING SURE THAT THAT DATABASE HAS SET UP READY TO GO BECAUSE ACCESS THING THAT DID THIS SENSE THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING. GIVEN ALL THE THINGS ARE GOING ON BETWEEN IT AND ITS AVAILABILITY. AND THAT'S WHY HAVING ACCESS THAT INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT'S MAYBE NOT GOOD ABOUT IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. MISTER JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT OFFICE ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AYE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIAL MEDIA. ARE IN THIS UPCOMING OUR SENSES AND I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT MEASURES. WOULD. POTENTIALLY BE IMPLEMENTED TO SAFEGUARD OUR OTHER DE INFORMATION OVER THE THE DATA THAT WE CAN IT BE COLLECTING. A FROM THESE PEOPLE IN TERMS OF UP A CYBERSECURITY IS CONCERNED I MEAN HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT DOG DE DATABASE THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER. WOULD NOT BE HACKED INTO OR OR A TAMPER WITH. A THIS IS BECAUSE SOME WHAT SIMILAR TO THE SECURITY ISSUE A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER BUT THIS IS MORE IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGY PIECE. IN LIGHT OF THE YEAR. DE ADVANCE IN COMBATING KNOWLEDGE IN COMPUTERS. I I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT IS WILL BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE. PROBABLY AYE MY UNDERSTATEMENT THIS BIKE BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE CENSUS BUREAU HAVE THAT LISTED AS ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST CONCERNS. BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO THEM. THANKS. AND ALSO ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER BROUGH. WHAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS I'M AT? I THINK WHAT WHAT YOU SAID IT WAS REINFORCED BY MISTER JONES SAWYER ABOUT THAT THE SANCTITY OF THAT INFORMATION THE SECURITY OF OF THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED IN THE FACT THAT IT CANNOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE. IT WOULD WE HAVE IT A DYE JOB WE WE FIRST HAVE TO COMMIT OURSELVES OF THAT FACT. THEN WE HAVE TO CONVINCE THE STAKEHOLDERS OF THAT FACT AND EMPOWER THEM TO GOING CAN IT'S THEIR COMMUNITIES. OF THAT FACT AND IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY YOU KNOW THAT IMPORTANT AND CHALLENGING. EFFORT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF TRUST. RIGHT NOW AND AND RIGHTFULLY SO AND AND SO. THE OF THESE TO THOSE TWO HISTORICAL EXAMPLES OF TIMES THE GOVERNMENT ON IT ENTITIES HAVE TRIED TO TO USE THAT INFO AT HAVE BEEN STOPPED. IS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL DOCTORS OUT I MEAN. DOCTOR PAIN IN I WERE WERE IN A CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WITH A GROUP OF FOUNDATIONS AND THIS ISSUE CAME UP AND. YOU KNOW WE DISCUSSED THE NEED TO REALLY COME UP WITH MATERIAL THAT THAT. GIVES PEOPLE THAT CONFIDENCE. AND HAVING THOSE TWO HISTORICAL EXAMPLES WILL DEFINITELY HELP WITH THAT BECAUSE. NOT YOU KNOW IF WE CAN CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THEN THEN WE HAVEN'T DONE OUR JOB AND I THINK YOU WOULD FIND. OTHER EXAMPLES THAT MARK CURRENT YEAH WELL IF I HAD A BET NAY AND BEGIN THE SET UP I'M SURE WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THOSE. BUT THE REAL KEY AND. IT'S NOT THE LEGISLATURE TALKING TO THE CITIZENSHIP. IT'S A LIVE ISSUE PASSES TALKING THING YEAH YEAH THAT'LL HAVE EASILY. THIS TRUSTED MESSENGERS YOU BETTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS AND BROUGHT REALLY APPRECIATE IT. JONES WAS BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO.

ALSO VERY REPRESENTATIVE APART ACCOUNT COMMUNITIES IN TWENTY TEN AND WE HAD A FIFTY TWO MEMBER COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEE ARMED THAT SERVE MORE AS A SPEAKERS BUREAU. AND SO THIS TIME AROUND WE WILL WE WANT TO GET BACK TO YOU A MISSION OF FOCUSING ON THE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES AND GETTING. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES AT THE TABLE FOR THE CAN HELP ON STRUCTURE IN AND ADVISE US ON HOW TO. HOW TO REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES WE'VE HAD ONE MEETING ALREADY? AND THAT CAN BECOME COMMITTEE HAS DECIDED TO PRIOR. TO TAKE ON FOR INITIAL ISSUES OF CONCERN AND HAVE DEVELOPED WORKING GROUP THAT TO TAKE ON THOSE CHALLENGES. AND THE FOR INCLUDE HOUSING MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGY TO TODAY. TO LOCATE PEOPLE AND THEY KNOW WHERE TO COUNT PEOPLE SO GETTING ALL THE DIFFERENT INPUTS DATA I. FINING THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT SERVE HOMELESS POPULATIONS MITCHELL BEAR INFORMING US AND THE FEDERAL BUREAU ON WHERE TO LOCATE PEOPLE. A FARM WORKER HOUSING ALL THAT REPORTERS AND AND AND A LOT OF NEW I YOU KNOW DEVELOPMENT SAID THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ON THE RADAR BEFORE. SECOND GROUP WILL BE WORKING ON CONTENT OF THE OFFENSIVE QUESTIONER INCLUDING THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. I WHICH WE KNOW IS WHICH WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING FOR CALIFORNIA GIVEN THAT. THAT WE HAVE. YOU TEN MILLION OVER TEN PEOPLE CALIFORNIA THAT ARE FOREIGN BORN BUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED. MANY HOUSEHOLDS WITH MIXED STATUS MEMBERS AND THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE SO THE WORKING GROUP'S FORMING TO HELP US THINK ABOUT HOW TO. ADDRESS THAT QUESTION THE THIRD GROUP IS TO IS FORMING ON TRUSTING CONFIDENTIALITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE REACH. UP ALL ISSUE THE OF EARNED SECURITY CLEAN CYBERSECURITY SHARING OF DATA AND AND MESSAGING AROUND TITLE THIRTEEN. AND A FOURTH GROUP THAT'LL FOCUS ON ACCESS ISSUE THAT THAT WHICH INCLUDE LANGUAGE ACCESS REACHING LANGUAGE ISOLATED COMMUNITIES. AND ARE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES MAKE SURE OUR MATERIALS AND IN THE FEDERAL MATERIALS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN CONTRAST PRIOR EFFORTS WE ARE THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN FORMED TO YEARS IN ADVANCE OF THE CENSUS% SO. AND THAT GIVES US MORE TIME THE BEFORE TO LEVERAGE THEIR EXPERTISE AND NETWORKS KING AND HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. AND AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING I CAN TELL YOU THE COMMITTEE IS VERY. ENGAGE AND IS EMBRACING THE CHALLENGES THAT. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA PASSES OVER TO TEACH OF KENTUCKY DS WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENSUS TWO THOUSAND CAMPAIGN FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE TWENTY TEN CAMPAIGN AND SHE'LL BE AGAIN TALKING ABOUT THE FEDERAL OPERATION AND CALIFORNIA'S PLAN. THANK YOU DAN WHAT I WANTED TO ACTUALLY THINK OWN DIRECTOR BROUGH BECAUSE OF THAT ORIGINAL. RACE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT THEY SET UP AT THE CENSUS BUREAU WHEN HE WAS THERE HAS EVOLVED TO THE NATIONAL VICE OUR COMMITTEE ON RACE ETHNICITIES AND OTHER POPULATIONS. AND I'VE BEEN SERVING ON THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND I BEEN THE CHAIR SINCE PROM TO THAT THE FIFTEEN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF SO I KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE FROM. THE CENSUS BUREAU CURRENTLY SO SLIDES AND ALL TALK REALLY FAST BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE. A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS TO THAT IT IS A FEDERAL OPERATION IT'S THE MOST COMPLEX FOR OPERATION IMPACTS OF COURSE ARE APPORTIONMENT REDISTRICTING. JUST REACHED OF DOLLARS AS MENTIONED IT'S INCLUSIVE EVENT AND IT'S REALLY CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AT ITS FINEST AND FOR ME I COME BACK. WAS MY THIRD DECENNIAL BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S A FOUNDATION TOWARD DEMOCRACY SO REALLY QUICKLY I'D REALLY LIKE THE SLIDE THAT. THE. JAMIE CHRISTY FROM THE US CENSUS PARA HEDGE SET UP SHARED WITH OUR COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE AGAIN IT'S REALLY POOR MAJOR OPERATIONS BROKE IT YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY COMPLEX OPERATION BUT THEY PUT IT INTO THESE BUCK. WHICH IS THEY GOT ESTABLISH WHERE ACCOUNT IT'S ADDRESS BASED SADDAM BY EMAIL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ALTHOUGH THE RESPONSES CAN BE DONE ONLINE. SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING THE LOCAL UPDATE OF SINCE ADDRESSES WHICH IS CALLED LUKA. WHICH THE GOVERNOR PUT IT ASIDE AND YOU GET PASSED A SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON MANY OF YOUR LOCAL AREAS ARE ACTUALLY DOING THAT THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S THE INVITATION LIST. IF YOU GET THAT WRONG YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A FOR. SO THEN THE SENTENCES PEROT MOTIVATES PEOPLE RESPOND THAT'S WHERE WE CAN HELP WE CAN HELP AT THE STATE LEVEL ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. ALONG THESE. THESE THE IT'S AREAS SO COURSE ESTABLISHING RECOUNT BUT THE LOCALS WE CAN HELP THE CENSUS BUREAU GET THE RIGHT LIST. MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO RESPOND AS DIRECTOR BROUGH SAID IT'S REALLY. IT'S LOCALLY DONE IN TERMS OF TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE KNOW ALL OF US COULD SIT HERE AND HELP ME TO BE COUNTED BUT IT REALLY COUNTS WHEN ITS LOCAL TRUSTED MESSENGERS. THEN THE CENSUS BUREAU ITSELF COUNTS THE POPULATION THEY ARE ENUMERATORS THEY ARE PAID BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT SO WE HAVE SOME. PARAMETERS AROUND THAT OF WHERE WE CAN HELP BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE THE SURROUND SOUND TO GET PEOPLE TO RESPOND AND THEN THE CENSUS BUREAU RELEASES THE CENSUS RESULTS ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE ACCOUNT GOES TO THE PRESIDENT AND THEN THOSE APARTMENT DATA COMES OUT AND THEN THAT'S WHERE WE FIGURE OUT IF WE ARE GAIN STATUS A STEADY OR LOST A SEAT. AND THEN ON APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS WHEN THE DAY COMES BACK TO THE STATES AND CURRENT AND HER GROUP AND VINCE AND HIS GROUP START TO LOOK AT IT FOR A REDISTRICTING. ALRIGHT BECAUSE OF ALL SEE THIS. AGO HAD SKIPPED THROUGH THAT I WANTED TO PROVIDE THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION WE'VE BEEN GOING OUT. COME ACROSS THE STATE RECENTLY DOING ARE CONVENING STATE ANTI TRUST THE MESSENGERS AND THERE IS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT HOW IS THIS THING TO BE DONE ONLINE. I CAN TALK FURTHER ABOUT BUT REALLY IT'S A MAILING THEY GET A LETTER THAT SAYS GO ONLINE AND DO YOU KNOW TO EIGHT DAYS LATER IF YOU DON'T RESPOND YOU CAN OTHER LETTER. SO YOU NEVER REALLY GET A FORM UNTIL REALLY. A MONTH AFTER YOU GET THAT FIRST LETTER IF YOU DON'T RESPOND YOU GET A LETTER PLUS A QUESTION HERE AND THEN IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO THAT AND OTHER DAYS WILL GET ANOTHER POSTCARD SAYING IT'S NOT TOO LATE. AND THEN ALMOST A MONTH AFTER YOU GET THEIR SIX WEEKS AFTER YOU GET THAT CONTACT. THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO BE PUT ON THE LIST FOR NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP SO I JUST WANTED THEY SORT OF CLARIFY THAT SO THAT'S ALL WE CAN TALK ABOUT TERMS OF FEDERAL OPERATIONS. YOU BECAUSE I KNOW WANT TO HEAR REALLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE LEVEL. BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT TO SOME OF THE BASIC STUFF. WAS OUT THERE. SO BECAUSE. YOU KNOW THE. WE'VE DONE THIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TEN WE'VE HAD. VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS TWO THOUSAND WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL WE'VE USED A LOT OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM TWO THOUSAND CURRENTLY THE STATEWIDE RITA READINESS A NEEDS ASSESSMENT I JUST WANT TO SAY CHAIRMAN BERMAN CHARM PAN. THESE TO US STAFFERS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU HAVE BEEN JUST CRITICAL IN GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THESE CAN BE THINGS AS WELL AS OURS ARE A SLEW OF OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND THEM. THAT HAVE AS WELL WOULDN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT THEM WE'VE DONE SEVEN OF THE OVER TWENTY FIVE THAT WE'RE GONNA DO WANNA DO FOUR ADDITIONAL TRIBAL CONSULTATIONS AS WELL. BECAUSE AS DIRECTOR BROUGH SAID YOU HAVE TO GO OUT. YEAH WE WERE UP IN UKIAH DOWN INCURRING WERE HEADING TO RIVERSIDE TOMORROW PALM DESERT IN IN EVERY PLACE THAT WE BEEN IT'S BEEN TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEIR FEARS ARE. HOW THEY THINK THEY CAN GET THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO RESPOND SO IT'S BEEN SUPER IMPORTANT? AS WE DIDN'T TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND TEN A STATE AGENCY WORKING GROUP THAT'S AGAIN THAT'S THE LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT'S LEVERAGING YOU KNOW EDIE DIS GOT OFFICES THEY SENT UP PAY STUBS THEY CAN SEND OUT. DMV'S GOT KIOSKS THEY CONSENT AS MUCH COMMUNICATIONS THEY WANT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER. BUCKETS OF AREAS THAT WE PLAN TO DO WORK AND I CAN ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ON THAT. I WANT TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE. THE ISSUES THOUGH IT IS THE FIRST DIGITAL CENSUS. AND YOU KNOW THE CENSUS BUREAU ATTIRE WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE I WANNA SAY PAPER IT'S GONNA BE EASIER FOR OUR BACK OFFICES. BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL PAIN HONESTLY WE'VE HEARD THE OPEN UKIAH THEY DON'T HAVE BROADBAND IN THOSE AREAS WERE HURT WILL HURT FROM RURAL AREAS. SO SIGNIFICANT EVEN HERE IN YOLO COUNTY REYES. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES GRAY EVEN IN IN URBAN AREAS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA BODMIN COUNCIL ON HOW WE MAPPED OUT BROADBAND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE REALLY YOU KNOW DEPENDABLE. A ONLINE ACCESS WE TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF FEDERAL FUNDING AND THE DIVERSITY BUT I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENTS OR TALK A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGES WHICH WE CAN SPEND MORE TIME ON. THE LET'S TALK ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO HUGE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH IS THE GOVERNOR GEENA COMMITTED TEN MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR AND AGAIN THE PROPOSED FORTY POINT THREE MILLION. THIS TIME AROUND WHICH WERE GOING THROUGH HEARINGS THAT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. NO ONE ACROSS THE STATE I'VE KNOWN ACROSS THE NATION HAS EVER COMMITTED THAT WE ARE HEAD OF THE ENTIRE NATION IN DOING THIS. ARM AND SO I THINK WE HAVE SOME HUGE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS ENGAGE FOUNDATIONS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RITUAL HERE FROM A LATER ON TODAY. ARE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE'S THE LINE ITEMS DOES HAVE THAT WE HAVE OUR APPROACH MODUS CRUISES THAT WHEN YOU GUYS CAN. AND THEN BASICALLY I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING ANY KIND OF. LARGE YOU KNOW STATE BUDGETING PEOPLE ARE NOT REALLY AWARE THAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT SO I JUST WANT TO TAKE A QUICK MOMENT ALSO THAT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT THE SLIDE. IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES SO ANY OF THE THE DOLLARS THAT ARE STATE OURS THAT ARE USED WILL COURSE FOLLOW STRICT CONTRACT MONITORING PAYMENTS WILL BE LINKED TO SALAS FOR TRACTOR PERFORMANCE. PERFORMANCE CRITERIA EVALUATION WILL BE DEVELOPED WOULD HAVE READ A REGULAR REPORTING. WELL HAVE ONSITE MONITORING SOMETIMES ANNOUNCE SOMETIMES ANNOUNCED AND OF COURSE THE FOLLOW DE JESS'S GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE ARE TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY STE. AND I CAN TALK ABOUT THE RESULT BEINGS BUT OF COURSE YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN THERE BUT IT REALLY GOES TO WHAT DIRECTOR BROUGH THIS TALK ABOUT ABOUT BUILDING THAT GROUND GAME. THOSE TRUSTED PARTNERS ON THE GROUND IN MAKING SURE THAT IT'S A LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. THERE'S JUST A QUICK YOU GUYS HAVE THAT HANDOUT WERE REALLY BUSY IN THE NEXT TWELVE WEEKS. AND HERE THIS IS HOW THEY FEEL IT FIT IN. AND THERE'S A SOME CRITICS A SUSPECT. BUT I WILL STOP RIGHT THERE AND ANSWER QUESTIONS PUBLIC TO TALK REALLY FAST. OKAY WHAT WELL THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT. IN ASKING YOU TRY TO. COVER ALL THIS BOTH OF EACH IN FIVE MINUTES I THINK IS VERY SHORT ABOUT TIME BUT. I. HOPE PEOPLE TAKE TIME TO LOOK AT THAT SLIDES IN MORE DETAIL. BEFORE I TAKE QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS I DID JUST HAVE ONE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT BUDGET. OUR RESPECTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEES ARE MEETING SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. CERTAINLY. AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS A PRIORITY ON THE CENSUS SO WE TALKED IN THE BEGINNING ABOUT ACTUALLY HOW MUCH MORE MONEY COMES IN FROM THE SENSES. AS WELL. LAYS THROUGHOUT THIS QUESTION. DEL FOR COVER CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE HAD TO THE ACA. SPENT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION TO GET OUT THERE TO GET PEOPLE TO KNOW THE GET PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. YEAH I KNOW SOME OF THAT BE HEARING FROM SOME THE COUNTIES AND CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT. THEY HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN TRYING TO HELP IDENTIFY PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE PERSUASION PART. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DOING IT KIND OF PART TIME AS PART OF YOU KNOW THAT IN ADDITION TO THEIR CURRENT JOBS AND SO FORTH THAT. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH MADE THESE BARRIERS. WELL YOU KNOW I I KNOW YOU SAID AND PRECEDENT BY UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMOUNT WAS ACTUALLY BECAUSE THAT WAS HOW MUCH WE SPEND PREVIEW IN THE PREVIOUS SEPSIS BEFORE. WHY? WHY SHOULDN'T WE ACTUALLY BE INVESTING A LOT MORE AND AND AND THE CENSUS COUNT? YOU HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA NEEDS A OVER A HUNDRED MILLION TO DO THAT. AND SO AND WE KNOW WE KNOW WE'RE STILL UNDER COUNTING. SHOULDN'T THE STATE BE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO IT ACTUALLY RETURN IS A VERY GOOD ONE. SO. SO I'M GOING TO ASK THAT QUESTION. BECAUSE WE'RE RIGHT NOW TALKING ABOUT OUR BUDGET AND I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE SENATE AND I KNOW THE ASSEMBLY OF BOTH INTERESTED IN BEING SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TRULY. GET A COMPLETE COUNT AND I OF THE GOVERNOR DOES AS WELL BUT WE THINK. GIVEN THE SCALE OF THIS SO WE WE SHOULD BE. ALLOCATING MORE RESOURCES AND HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. I'LL START I I THINK THAT I'M. THE PLANET IT'S OVER FIFTY COLLEGE WITH LAST YEAR'S PERHAPS TEN MILLION IT'S FIFTY MILLION SUCH TWICE THE AMOUNT THAT WAS. AND EXPANDED IN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL YEAR WHICH TWO THOUSAND AND THE GROWING AT TWENTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION PART ONE FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION. INVESTED IN TWO THOUSAND I THINK YOU KNOW I AM WHAT I KNOW IT W. ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS ON THE FINAL NUMBER WHATEVER YOU KNOW THE INTO LEGISLATION GOVERNOR LAND I THINK THE KEY PRINCIPLES HERE WILL BE TO. MAKE SURE WE HAVE THESE THE STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE LAID OUT IN TERMS OF HAVING TRUST THE MESSENGERS THAT GET FUNDED THAT WE HAVE. PAID MEDIA STRATEGY THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGY THAT IN CORPORATE LOCAL SCHOOLS AND THEY PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE IN EDUCATING STUDENTS ABOUT THE CENSUS WITH AND EDUCATE THEIR PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES. AND THE LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES ALSO ARE INCENTIVIZE TO PARTICIPATE WE MEDIA AND OUR PROPOSAL UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A MULTI PRONGED STRATEGY WE HAVE TO GET A LOT OF FOLKS ON. TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE AS OTHERS FOLKS HAVE SAID TODAY TO EDUCATE AND THE STATE ABOUT THE PROCESS AND TO MOTIVATE AND THEN GET FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE SO THAT'S. TO HAVE YOU LEFT FOR CALIFORNIA WE MEET THE DEFINITION THAT. AND IT IN THE IN THE MISSIONS THAT REALLY. THREE YEAR. OPERATION AND. SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S. I THINK THE INTERESTS ARE ONLINE AND THESE KEY STRATEGIES I THINK HAVE TO REMAIN IN PLAY. AND TO OUR WEEKLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHERE THINGS WHEN I KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS RIGHT NOW AND. THAT HE PROPOSED ABOUT WHICH STRATEGIES TO GET MORE FUNDING VERSUS OTHERS BUT I THINK THE COMBINATION CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT. AND I'LL POINT OUT THAT. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE DID THAT THE STATE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AT ALL BUT. MANY OF FOUNDATIONS THAT YOU CAN SPEAK TO TODAY PUT UP FROM THEIR OWN COFFERS ALMOST NINE TEN MILLION OF THEIR OWN. AND SO. IN THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN HAVING OVER THE LAST YEAR WITH ENGAGED FOUNDATIONS THAT PRETTY STUNNED I KIND OF CHALLENGE THEM TO GO AHEAD AND MATCH. A WHATEVER WE DO THE STATE'S SO. YOUR TO BE SPENT TO THE MOBILE AT WORK AND I APPRECIATE IT AND I THINK PHILANTHROPY HAS BEEN STEPPING UP. BUT I THINK THE STATE CAN ALSO. DO MORE. AND I APPRECIATE THE PLAN BRASSO THINK THAT ESPECIALLY WILL TRY TO REACH OUT TO MORE THE YOU KNOW TRUSTED MESSENGERS. I'M NOT ALL AMERICA HAVE DONE AUDITS EVERY YEAR AND ALL THE SUDDEN. SO I APPRECIATE CON ABILITY PIECE BUT I ALSO WONDER. TO WHAT DEGREE. THAT ALSO MAKES IT HARDER FOR US TO ENGAGE SOME OF THAT TRUSTED MANAGED MESSENGERS AND. MORE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND AND MORE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND SO HOW WE PARTNER WITH OUR PHILANTHROPIC AND OTHER. NONPROFIT CPOS AND SO FORTH THAT TO TO REALLY REACH OUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE WATCHING MAINSTREAM MEDIA. THERE MAY NOT BE THE ONES WHO ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT YOU KNOW WE GOT IT MANY TAKE SOME. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TO GET THEM AND ALSO BE SURE WE PROVIDE SUPPORT THAT ARE YOU KNOW. AT OUR LOCAL LEVELS WELL UMPIRE CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS AS WELL BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT MORE TO LOCAL CONNECTION. SO IT'S ONE BE SURE WE ARE YOU KNOW POSITIONING OURSELVES FOR THAT. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE ARE SOME NEVER GONNA JONES SAWYER. SO SO I ALSO. DON'T LIKE REINVENT WILL TAUGHT HOUSE WANNA KNOW WHAT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT SEEMS LIKE A AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WORKED. BUT HE DID WORK IN MY. COMMUNITY BEFORE SO BESIDES ME BLAMING MY PREDECESSOR I NEED TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY. HOME. WHAT I CAN DO DIFFERENTLY TO GET MY NUMBERS UP THE MORE IMPORTANT? WHAT WE DIDN'T DO OR? WHAT DO WE DO SO A STRATEGY WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO WORK AN ABSOLUTELY FAILED CAN YOU PINPOINT? WITH SOME SPECIFICITY TO EACH OF OUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS WHAT WORKED SOME. THIS WORKED GREAT FOR AND THERE DAY OFF THE CHARTS AS FAR AS OF SUCCESS. BUT THERE SOME THAT IT DIDN'T WORK FOR TO YOU YOU CAN'T GIVE. EVERY DISTRICT IT KIND OF. BOILERPLATE THIS IS WHAT WILL WORK IN EVERY DISTRICT SO WHICH ARE RUN BY REPORT FROM TWO THOUSAND BUT I WAS JUST LOOKING AT YESTERDAY AND. ACTUALLY THE AREAS THAT WE IN TWO THOUSAND WE ONLY INVESTED AREAS THAT WERE HARD TO COUNT THAT HAD A HIGH INTO ACCOUNT. AND IN THE CITY OF COMPTON IT HAD THE HIGHEST INCREASE A RETURN RATE IT WAS SIXTEEN PERCENT SO WAS A RICH IT WENT UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SO WHAT'S MINUS SIXTEEN. AND THEN SANTA ANA ALSO HAD A FOURTEEN PERCENT INCREASE AND AMANTE HOW THE FOURTEEN PERCENT INCREASE I JUST REMEMBER THOSE THREE BECAUSE I WROTE THEM DOWN. FOR YESTERDAY'S HEARING AND THAT'S WHERE WE ACTUALLY INVESTED ON THE GROUND WE PUT A YOU KNOW QUESTION YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THERE AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT FINE IT'S ACTUALLY CAME BACK TO THE DEMOGRAPHICS RESURGENT AND THEY DID THIS ANALYSIS SO IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. AS YOU CAN SEE THE CITY BY CITY WHERE THE UNDERCOUNT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY WHERE WE INVEST IN TWO THOUSAND AND THE THE INCREASE SO. I KNOW FOR THAT WAS FOR TWO THOUSAND SO FOR TWO THOUSAND TEN WE DIDN'T DO MUCH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A DOLLARS SO THAT MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING BACK TO. BUT WE ONLY HAD TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN A TWO THOUSAND TEN. AND SO WE NEED TO SHIP IT TO THE TOP TWELVE OUR HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTIES AND THEN THEY DISTRIBUTE FROM THERE I THINK THAT'S WHICH CHAIRS A GETTING TO. GIVE US SOME RATIONALE FOR WHY WE NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY. IN THIS TO GET IT DONE. I THINK JUST TO ADD ONE OF THAT BOTH REPORTS FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TEN HAVE. FLAG THE ISSUE OF STARTING TO THE EIGHT AS A PLATFORM LEARNED. LIKE THE COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEES BOTH TIMES STARTED I'M. LIKE TWENTY THOUSAND STARTING NOVEMBER NINETEEN I'M AND THE SUCH AS OF APRIL TWO THOUSAND TO DEFLECT. SIX MONTHS TO WORK WITH AND THEN IN IN TWENTY TEN BACK THE COMPANY STARTED IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND NINE AGAIN JUST BE EAT LESS THAN A YEAR PRIOR TO THE SENSE THAT SAID THERE'S VERY LITTLE TIME. TO STRATEGIZE AND DEPLOY. AND SO I THINK. THAT WAS THE KEY MASS AND I FOR ALL OF US TO GET TOGETHER SOONER WORK TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE BECAUSE IT IS A MUTUAL INTEREST TO ALL OF US AND TO STRATEGIZING. AND THAT I THINK WE TOOK THAT SERIOUSLY AND WE'VE AND WE STARTED WITH THE LOOK OF PROCESS IN AND BUILDING THAT AND. THE LOOK AT DIFFERENT VOTERS HAVE AND LATE TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR FOUR YEARS AND IT. IN ADVANCE OF THE FACETS OF SUCH THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET THE DATA ON YOU HOUSING CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FROM TO GET HIM FOR YEARS ADVANCE GET GET THE BALL ROLLING. SO I THINK ANOTHER LESSON LEARNED WOULD BE. THE COORDINATION WITH THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU DOING IT EARLIER. WERE HEAD OF THE CENSUS BUREAU RIGHT NOW THEY AND LITERALLY HAVE LIKE FOUR PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST ACROSS THE STATE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE'RE STARTING WERE SO FAR AHEAD OF THEM THAT THEY'RE KIND OF YOU KNOW TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP WITH US. ALL AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL HIRE PEOPLE IN NOVEMBER OF THIS NOVEMBER. SO SO ON THAT FRIGHTENED DO THIS YOU MENTION THIS IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT WE ASK SOMEBODY FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU IN DC TO COME OUT AND SPEAK WITH US TODAY. AND ON UNFORTUNATELY THEY THEY DECLINED OUR INVITATION. SO WE HOPE THAT. THEY'LL BE BETTER COORDINATION WITH THEM MOVING FORWARD. BUT YOU YOU ALSO MENTION THAT THEY'RE QUITE BEHIND. JUST HERE CALIFORNIA THEY ALSO QUITE BEHIND AND IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS WHAT CAN WE DO TO FILL GAPSTHAT THEY'RE LEAVING. YEAH UNFORTUNATELY THEY RUN THE CENSUS AND WE CAN TAKE OVER THAT BUT BUT ARE THE YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE AREAS WHERE YOU SEE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT MEETING THEIR THEIR CALENDAR IN THEIR TIMELINE ON THINGS. YEAH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LET US KNOW IF IF THERE WAYS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT YOU. ON TO IT TO FILL THOSE GAPS THAT THERE'D. LIKELY GONNA LEAVE OUR COMMUNITIES. ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE GOT A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS BUT UMPS YES A GO GO FOR NOW YOU BELIEVE. SO I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT STRATEGIES THAT WORK AND THEN WORK WE CERTAINLY CAN LOOK AT PREVIOUS SENSES. THEIR SOME THINGS ARE DIFFERENT THE ONLINE. IS THERE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT. DOING WHY YELL PRACTICE RUNS ARE DRY RUNS. I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW WE GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT WE DO HAVE TO TO TEST DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU KNOW PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE RIGHT AND THEN WHEN THE REAL THING COMES. ABOUT THAT. ABOUT TESTING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND DOING SOME DRY RUNS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT. EFFORTS MAY WORK OUT. SO RIGHT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MESSAGE TESTING ON COORDINATION GROUP ARE THAT HAS MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT YOU'RE GONNA COME UP UP AND SPEAK IN OTHERS. ON THAT ARE ALREADY DOING MESSAGE TESTING OUT IN THE FIELD. SO THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST THING AND OF COURSE THE FIRST ONE AND WE DO IN WAVES THE FIRST WAVE OF MESSAGING MRS TESTING RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE TRUE DIFFERENT THAN A YEAR FROM NOW. SO WE ARE HEAD THE US CENSUS BUREAU IS DOING WHAT THEY CALL SEE BANDS CENSUS BARRIERS ATTITUDES AND MOTIVATORS AND CONSIDERING IT NATIONALLY AND THEY HAVE A FEW FOCUS GROUPS HERE. BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING INTO THE GRANULARITY THAT WE NEED FOR OUR COMMUNITIES SO MANY OF THE PARTNERS WERE ALREADY WORKING WITH ARE DOING THAT NECESSARY STING. I'M IN TERMS OF SORT OF DRESS REHEARSAL WE CAN'T REALLY DRESS REHEARSED THE OPERATIONS A ONE WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE BECAUSE THE HASN'T BEEN COMPLETED. I DID DO A BETA TEST OF THE ONLINE AND INTERNET SUFFER SPOTS TOOL LAST APRIL. OF THE USER EXPERIENCE LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED SO I THINK IN ARE CONVENING AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. AND THE PEOPLE WE ARE OPEN UP UKIAH AND READING THEIR LIKE HOW DO WE GET ACTUAL PAPER FORM. LIKE IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S ONLINE BUT CERTAINLY IS LIKE I WANT TO BE PERFORMED. AND SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE BEING VERY CREATIVE TO SAY THE SUCH AS PRO SO YOU KNOW YOU CAN JUST CALL AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ON THE PHONE WELL I DON'T EASE OF MY MINUTES. BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST CALL THEY HUNDRED NUMBER AND GET THEM TO SEND YOU UP FOR SO WE'RE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT THAT WERE HAVING GREAT CONVERSATIONS OUT THE COMMUNITY. ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THE ANSWERS COME FROM WORSE IN YOUR COMMUNITIES I CAN'T MAKE IT UP YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP RIGHT. SO IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO BE OUT THERE. SO. SO I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I WAS GONNA ASK AROUND MESSAGING INVEST TESTING. AND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA THE SPENDING THEY ARE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON OUR REGION COMMUNICATION AND AND KIND OF STATEWIDE MESSAGING AND AND. DIFFERENT MESSAGING TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. TESTING THAT AHEAD OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ACTUALLY GIVES PEOPLE THAT SECURITY. TO PARTICIPATE. AS OPPOSED TO JUST KIND OF GUESSING. IS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW FOLKS OUT IN THE FIELD THEIR TESTING MESSAGES THERE FEEDING THAT BACK UP AS YOUR ALL. TEARING ACROSS ORGANIZATIONS YOU CAN GREAT. AYE I KNOW DOCTOR PAN. EMPHASIZED AT THE BUDGET AND YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO DO THAT AS WELL I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW. WE DON'T WANT TO BE FRIVOLOUS WITH OUR SURPLUS AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO SPEND SURPLUS DOLLARS ON ONE TIME EXPENDITURES THERE IS NO ONE TIME EXPENDITURE THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A. HIGHER RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN THE CENSUS. YEAH AND THEN YOU ON THE NUMBERS BUT IN THIS WILL BE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT DECADE. IF THERE'S IF THERE'S A LARGE UNDERCOUNT SO AS SOON AS WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. IN A WORLD TALKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES INCLUDING OUR OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEES TO. IN A PUSH FOR AS LARGE OF A A DOLLAR NUMBER IS POSSIBLE AND I THINK YOU ARE CBO COMMUNITY ARE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY NEEDS A LITTLE I KNOW THIS IS JUST. YOU YOU. THE FIRST YEAR THERE REALLY A SECOND THIRD YEAR DEPENDING ON ON HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN A MULTI YEAR PROCESS BUT THE CBO COMMUNITY NEED SOME CERTAINTY. IF THEY'RE GONNA MAKE THE HIRES YOU KNOW THAT THOSE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT. ARE GONNA BE ON STAFF FOR TWO YEARS OR TWO AND A HALF YEARS AS OPPOSED TO. YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF THE YEAR BY YEAR BUDGETING THAT HAVING WORKED FOR NONPROFIT THAT I KNOW THAT. THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY TYPICALLY DOES SO THAT WE KNOW WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THAT CERTAINTY. THAT THERE'S GONNA BE FUNDING THERE FOR THIS EFFORT THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. SIR DID YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN HAPPENING AT THE REGIONAL MEETINGS I KNOW YOU'RE. MAYBE THIRTY OR FORTY PERCENT OF THE WAY THROUGH THAT THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE I DON'T TO CREATE A LOT OF EXTRA WORK. BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEES TO GET JUST AN UPDATE WHEN YOU HIT THAT MIDWAY POINT OR SOON AFTER THE MIDWAY POINT. OF HOW THOSE HOW THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING AND IF WE. ARE DISTRICT OFFICES NEED TO HELP MORE IN DRIVING THE RIGHT PEOPLE THERE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT. WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO FIGHT HERE HOW IT'S GOING IN THE DISSEMINATE OUR COLLEAGUES ABOUT HOW THEY CAN. YOU MAKE THAT EXPERIENCE MORE MEANINGFUL AND AND AND BETTER. YEAH I HAVE A POINT WHERE I AND NUMBER EIGHT TOMORROW AND SO PROBABLY BY RIGHT AFTER THE JUNE FIRST AFTER WE MEET MEN WITH MOUNTAIN VIEW. A WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREATHER ACTION AT THIS SIXTH AND SEVENTH WILL HAVE SOMETIME AFTER JUNE SIXTH SEVENTH TO. TAKE BUT I'LL TELL YOU YOU'RE JUST OFFICES HAVE BEEN GREAT CAR AND NEED OTHER IT WE'RE DOING A SHORT TIME FRAME BECAUSE WE'RE FAST AND FURIOUS BUT. THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE THERE PERFECT PERFECT. AND THAT I DE ANYTHING ELSE THAT EITHER BECAUSE WHEN I ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION OR YEAH THINGS THAT YOU WANT US TO KNOW ABOUT. NO WE RUSSIA THROUGH THE SLIDES NO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WE REALLY AYE TH YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK I. JUST ABSOLUTELY GET TASK THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COOPERATION AND LET ME JUST QUICKLY SAY BEFORE MOVE TO THE NEXT PANEL YEAH I'VE MET IN THE SET A COUPLE OF OTHER.

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NONPROFIT IN THE DISTRICT AND I BUT I BROUGHT THIS UP IN THIS AT ALL YEAH WE'RE GOING TO THAT MEETING ON JUNE FIRST AMOUNT YOU SO THEY ARE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT IN THEIR IN THEIR PLAN TO PARTICIPATE. YOU'RE IN MIGHT MIGHT DREAM IS FOR YOU KNOW BY THE TIME WE GET TO APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. EVERY CBO EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY EVERY LIBRARY EVERY SCHOOL.

OF THE CENSUS FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF TODAY'S CONVERSATION ABOUT PREPARING FOR THE CENSUS. WHILE FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS OUR DETERMINE AND DISTRIBUTED IN LARGE MEASURE BY CENSUS DRIVE DATA ULTIMATELY IT IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH THEIR DIVERSE WORKFORCE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AND ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT PROVIDE THE ON THE GROUND DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE PROVIDE THE ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR ALL OUR RESIDENTS FURTHERMORE IT IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAS THE CAPACITY TO ORGANIZE AND PARTNER WITH ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. AGENCIES AS WELL AS KEY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO PROMOTE PARTICIPATION IN THE CENSUS. SO HOW IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY TAKING ON THIS MONUMENTAL TASK. WELL FIRST WE ARE THE FIRST OUT OF THE GATE. WE'RE HERE TO GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT OF OUR EFFORTS TODAY. WE STARTED WITH THE CREATION OF THREE COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEES. ONE THAT FOCUSED ON FOCUSES ON COUNTIES REGION WIDE EFFORTS. AND THEN TWO OTHER COMPLETE CAMPOUT COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES THAT FOCUS ON COUNTY CENSUS DERIVED FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM AREAS. CURRENTLY THE COUNTY WIDE OUTREACH CCC THAT WE CALL LEAD WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS BECOME A DYNAMIC EVER GROWING INTO FIRST PARTNERSHIP THAT INCLUDES SEVERAL SUBCOMMITTEES. THE FIRST EVER COMMITTEE THAT WE ORGANIZE WAS OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE THAT WE. PARTICIPATE AT A COMMUNITY TABLE. THAT THE CENSUS POLICY ADVOCATES THE NETWORK PULLED TOGETHER WITH THEIR PARTNERS THEIR FIFTEEN PARTNERS AND WE FOCUS ON A BROAD RANGE OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY LOW INCOME POPULATIONS CHILDREN. THOSE LIVING WITH DISABILITY SENIORS AND THE HOMELESS. WITH THE RECENT ADDITION OF THIS IS CITIZENSHIP STATUS QUESTION THE FOCUS ON OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS ARE BECOMING PARAMOUNT. WE JOIN BUT THE CITY. AND OZ WE ARE SPONSORING WITHIN LA O. A CONVENING ON IMMIGRATION TOMORROW. AS WELL AS. WE'VE HAD A COMPETING WITH LATINO COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. ALSO THE COUNTIES IMMIGRATION TASK FORCE HAS ADDED THE CENSUS AS A FOCUS AREA INITIATIVE FOR THEMSELVES. ANOTHER SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH IS HUGE OUR OUR MUNICIPALITIES. IN A COUNTY WITH EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY UNINCORPORATED AREAS WE HAD TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FORUM THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS. AND IN CASE IT WILL GO TO IDEAS. WE'RE UTILIZING OUR SIX COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT. AN AN ANTELOPE VALLEY CONSORTIUM AS AN AVENUE TO REACH OUR CITY MAYORS MATT CITY MANAGERS AND CITY PLANNERS THAT'LL BE INVESTED IN THE CENSUS. ANOTHER SUBCOMMITTEE IS HIGHER EDUCATION. HIGHER EDUCATION HAS A PARTICULARLY UNIQUE CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITIES STUDENTS REPRESENT ONE OF THE LOWEST RESPONSE POPULATIONS COUNTY WIDE. SO WE BROUGHT TOGETHER HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING USC UCLA LOYOLA MARYMOUNT MOUNT SAINT MARY'S OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE. THE STATE COLLEGES AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND WE'VE INCLUDED BOTH ADMINISTRATORS AND STUDENTS TO DISCUSS. AND EXPLORE A WIDE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS. AT INCLUDING USING COLLEGE ADDRESSES AS THE RESIDENTS ADDRESS FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS. SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES REPRESENT THIRD THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR STUDENT BODY. IS HOMELESS THEIR LIVING EITHER ON COUCHES COUCH SURFING OR IN CARS VEHICLES. WHERE I'M LOOKING AT PROVIDING INTERNSHIP OR VOLUNTEER CREDIT FOR STUDENTS TO ENGAGE THEM A CENSUS GOODWILL AMBASSADORS? WE'RE UTILIZING STUDENT GOVERNMENT FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES COUNSELORS AND FACULTIES AS MESSENGERS. INCLUDING THE SENSE IS THIS PART OF THE ONLINE CLASS REGISTRATION SO THEY HAVE TO OPT. IN TWO THE CENSUS AND RESPOND. WHEN THEY GO TO REGISTER THEIR VEHICLES FOR PARKING. WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO STUDENT GROUPS. ESPECIALLY AT SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES. THEY TOO WILL HAVE TO SEE AND PARTICIPATE AND BE A PART OF THE MESSAGING OF THE CENSUS. WHERE WE'RE TAKING ALL OF THE ONLINE PART OF PORTALS AND WEB SITES THAT THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT? WE'RE CREATE RICK TALKING ABOUT CREATING FRIENDLY COMPETITIONS THROUGH THE ARTS. AND WORKING WITH DEPARTMENTS THAT EDUCATE FUTURE NURSES PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. TO CONSIDER A MODULE IN THEIR LECTURES. AND WE'RE ALSO PARTNERING WITH USE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU TO PROVIDE JOB OPPORTUNITIES WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR A SPECIALLY IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND LA TRADE TACK AND AREAS SUCH AS THAT. OUR NEXT PARTNER THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THAT WE JUST STARTED WITH IS LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THIS DISTRICT REACHES OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS BETWEEN K. THROUGH TWELVE AND WE HAVE THIRTY ONE OF OUR CITIES. THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY ALSO HAVE A DAHLE PROGRAMS AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CAN UTILIZE IN OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS. WERE LOOKING AT EXPANDING THEIR WE ARE ONE LA UNIFIED CAMPAIGN. WHICH THEY'VE USED FOR THEIR DOCKET STUDENTS TO INCLUDE THE SENSES AS WELL AS OTHER DISTRICT WIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMATIC EFFORTS. ALONG WITH THE STUDENT AND PARENT SENSES COULD WELL AMBASSADOR VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES. THE CITY THE COUNTY AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO SCHEDULE A HALF DAY WORKSHOP IN JUNE. TO BRAINSTORM IDEAS AROUND CENSUS OUTREACH. NOT BE AND THAT INCLUDES HOW WE WILL EXPAND TO OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEYOND LA UNIFIED. VERY RECENT WE ALSO HAVE TO IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE REALLY ADVOCATING ONE THERE ARE IS SENT CENSUS ACTION KIOSKS. WE PLAN TO ASK DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO SET ASIDE SPACE IN PUBLIC FACILITIES TO ALLOW FOR THE SET UP OF HIS SENSES ACTION HE ASKED. WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN VISIT HIM FILL OUT ONLINE CENSUS SURVEYS? YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THE QUESTION ASSISTANCE CENTERS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED LAST GO AROUND ARE GOING TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO JUST MOBILE UNITS WERE TALKING ABOUT NOT HAVING. SOMEBODY HAVE TO RESPOND TO A MOBILE UNIT BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR AND WE'RE FINE WITH MOBILE UNITS BUT ALSO HAVE A STATIONARY LOCATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY CAN REACH. WE ALSO ARE ASKING THAT% VOLUNTEERS GOOD WILL SENSE HE SAID PASSERS BE TRAIN TO OFFICIALLY ASSIST WITHOUT REACHING ANSWER QUESTIONS. THE COUNTY HAS NUMEROUS VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS WE INTENDED TAP INTO THOSE AS WELL AS STU AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THE STUDENTS. WE'VE ALSO. TALK TO YOU OUR UNIONS. THEY'VE EXPRESSED A STRONG INTEREST IN ENGAGING IN THE COUNTY CENSUS PLANNING PROCESS AND OUR FIRST MET MEETINGS WITH THE UNIONS. THERE COMPETING RIGHT NOW TO GET TO ME FIRST. BUT THEY'LL BE IN JUNE. I PROMISE. I HOME AND THEN WE ALSO HELD A HACKATHON. THAT THIS CITY AND THE COUNTY IS PART OF THE LA CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY'S DIGITAL INCLUSION WEEK. IT DREW PEOPLE FROM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. AND WE EVEN HAD VIRTUAL PROP PARTICIPATION FROM THE COUNTRY OF COLOMBIA. AND THEY SPENT THE DAY WITH US LOOKING AT CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS TO RESPOND AT THE CENSUS. AND THE WINNING TEAM DEVELOPED TO SERIES OF APPS FOR THE CENSUS ACTION HE ASKS. COUNTY ALSO HAS THE TWO OTHER COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEES HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS ONE AND THE OTHER IS TRANSPORTATION. WITH THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF MESSAGING AROUND THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF COUNTY PROP PROGRAMS OFFERED TO COUNTY RESIDENTS. THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL AND STATE REVENUES. TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY WHY AND I FEELING OUT THE CENSUS. AND IT'S CRITICAL FOR RESIDENTS AND WHITES CRITICAL FOR THE MISS RESIDENTS TO PARTICIPATE. FINALLY WE WILL BE SUPPORTING THE STATE CENSUS OPERATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO ATTENDING THE CONVENIENCE THAT WILL BE IN LA COUNTY AND WE HOPE TO ADD AN EXTRA ONE. FOR OUR RESIDENTS IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY THAT'S A PLUG. ALL OF THESE EFFORTS WILL REQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY FROM OUR PARTNERS. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE CURRENTLY PREPARING RIGHT NOW OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY PLANTS BASED ON ANALYSIS OF THE LOW RESPONSE SQUARE BLOCK GROUPS UTILIZING THE COUNTY'S MAPPING TOOL. SO THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS A MAPPING TOOL AT THE CENSUS TRACK LEVEL WE DEVELOPED ONE AT THE BLOCK GROUP LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. WE ALSO HAVE QUARTERLY STATUS WORK PLANS THAT IDENTIFY ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE GONNA MORE BE WORKING ON THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING. STATUS AND NEXT STEPS AS WE APPROACH THE CENSUS WE ROLL OUT ACT AND THEN WE PLAN TO ROLL OUT ACTIVITY AND EVENT CALENDARS. ALL OF THESE PLANNING DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU WHO THEY ARE USING THOSE MATRIALS TO TRAIN THE REST OF THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE. I WANNA MOVE ON BECAUSE OF TIME HERE. AND IN CLOSING ALL OF THESE EFFORTS AND PARTNERSHIPS REQUIRE RESOURCES. SO ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE COUNTY'S REQUEST FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES ARE ANTICIPATED NEED ALONE IS MINIMALLY TWELVE MILLION. TO CARRY OUT THE STRATEGIES AND WORK PLANS AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN IN ADDRESSING ESPECIALLY IN ADDRESSING THIS TO CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. BASED ON THE COUNTIES TWENTY TEN BEST PRACTICES AND CURRENT PLANNING EXPERIENCE IT'S THE COUNTY'S POSITION THAT WE MUST BE INCLUSIVE AND OPEN TO THE BROADEST RANGE OF PARTNERS THAT ARE EAGER TO PARTICIPATE. IN COUNTING EACH AND EVERY RESIDENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE IS NO ONE SINGLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR STAKEHOLDER THAT CAN TAKE ON THIS ENORMOUS TASK ALONE AND IT'S IMPERATIVE. THAT WE ALL WORK AND SHARE IDEAS NEW CONCEPTS AND APPROACHES TO REACH AND ULTIMATELY SERVE ALL OF OUR DESERVING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HIS COLEMAN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CAROLYN COLEMAN I AS SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND. A PROUD MEMBER OF THE COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY AS WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING ALREADY A FAIR AND ACCURATE CENSUS. IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS FIRST IT HELPS SUPPORT OUR POLITICAL REPRESENTATION IN WASHINGTON A WHICH IS IS EVER IMPORTANT AND IT ALSO SERVES AS THE THE BASIS. FOR THE FORMULAS THAT ARE USED TO RETURN OUR DOLLARS BACK TO CALIFORNIA CITIES AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS TODAY AND. AND REALLY UP SORT OF HIT HOME ON WHY THIS MATTER SO MUCH TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CD BEACHY I KNOW I HAVE SOME FORMER. LOCAL OFFICIALS ON THIS PANEL WHO ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT PROGRAM. CBG DOLLARS GO TO CITIES WITH AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION AND COUNTIES OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THEY RECEIVE A DIRECT ALLOCATION OF THE CBG FUNDS. AND FOR THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THERE'S A SET ASIDE AT THE STATE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES RECEIVED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CD BG FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS. AND THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CITY BG THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOCATED PERIOD IN THE COUNTRY SO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS WHAT IT'S WORTH TO US. ANNUALLY. THIS PROGRAM IS THE MOST FLEXIBLE FORM OF ASSISTANCE THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES RECEIVE IT IS USED TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ENERGY EFFICIENCY. INITIATIVES AS WELL OF JOB AS JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH I KNOW ARE ALL IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR THE STATE AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND FOR THESE REASONS CITY OFFICIALS ARE VERY KEEN AND DO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN THE CENSUS UNDERTAKING. WERE ALSO KEENLY AWARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS AS. MY COLLEAGUE HAS REFER TO SOME OF THE NEW VULNERABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS YOUR SENSES NEW QUESTIONS NEW TECHNOLOGY ON IN PLACE AS WELL AS IN THIS STATE. OTHER HOUSING CRISIS WHICH CAN MAKE ADDRESSES OF VERY VERY DIFFICULT THAT WILL ONLY MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING AND MORE IMPORTANT THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE COORDINATED SO THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST. UP OUT OF THE BOX APPROACH ACCOUNTING EVERYONE IN TWENTY TWENTY. SO WHAT ROLE WILL CITIES PLAY FIRST THROUGH THE LOCAL UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESSES PROGRAM OR LUKA AS YOU'VE HEARD. CITIES WILL HELP MAKE SURE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE BEST ADDRESSES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO EVERYONE CAN BE COUNTED. AND WITH NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND HOPEFULLY MORE THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE. OF OUR ROLE IN HELPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDERSTAND THESE ADDRESSES AND WHERE THEY ARE WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. SECOND CITY OFFICIALS CAN HELP EDUCATE AND RAISE THE AWARENESS BY THEIR RESIDENTS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS ENCOURAGE THEM TO RESPOND VIA QUESTIONNAIRE BY DIALING EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER IN GETTING A FORM. AND THE MANY OTHER WAYS THAT WE'VE HEARD SHARE TODAY. AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID AND TWENTY TEN. THE LEAGUE WILL BE USING ITS VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS AND ITS REGIONAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS NETWORK TO SERVE AS A CONDUIT OF INFORMATION TO CITY OFFICIALS AROUND THE STATE REGARDING THE EFFORT. AND WE KNOW WHAT YOU KNEW NO IS THAT EVERY CITY IS DIFFERENT EVERY REGION IS DIFFERENT AND ALL WE WANT TO BE SURE TO GET. THE BEST IDEAS OUT THERE AND LET THEM TAILOR THE SOLUTIONS ARE TO FIT THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN CLOSING CALIFORNIA CITIES LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE STATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE PARTNERS WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM US SHORTLY AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE COUNTED THAT WERE ONLY COUNTED ONCE. AND THAT WERE COUNTED IN THE RIGHT PLACE BANKING I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS COLEMAN. WANTED OPEN UP THE COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEY HAVE. I ONCE GOT SEAN. WELL I HAVE A COUPLE A. QUESTIONS AND IN COMMENTS ON COLEMAN YOU MENTIONED. THE IMPORTANCE OF CITIES AND AND ALSO THE LOCAL PROCESS AND. I NEXT WENT TO ONE OF MY CITIES I IN MY DISTRICT WHERE. WE'D TRIED TO THE I INSTRUCTED MY DISTRICT STAFF TO REACH OUT TO ALL THE CITIES AND CITY MANAGERS TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THE LOCAL PROCESS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. UMD AND THEN. DIED FOUND OUT I I KIND OF HEARD THAT ONE OF MY CITIES HAD DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE AT FIRST THEY THEY SAID THEY'RE GOING TO AND THEN WHEN SOME OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS HER TO WAIT WAIT BE WALKING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS. WITH CLIP BOARDS YOU KNOW COUNTING LOOKING IT OVER PEOPLE'S FENCES AND COUNTING YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF. THE UNTRADITIONAL. HOUSING UNITS THAT MIGHT EXIST PET FREE THAT SCARE THEM. AND AND RIGHTFULLY SO I MEAN YOU KNOW THIS DAY AND AGE. IT'S THEM THESE NEIGHBORHOODS I KNOW A LOT OF THOSE RESIDENTS ARE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF FEAR IF THEY SEE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW LOOKING THROUGH FENCES AND AND. HAVE MAKING NOTES AND THEY'RE WORRIED IS THE INFORMATION TO BE USED FOR FOR. YET TODAY FOR CODE ENFORCEMENT AND MAYBE SOME OTHER THINGS. AND SO WHAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IN THAT WAS AS MUCH MY FAULT AS ANYBODY'S FOR NOT REACHING OUT TO QUICKLY CALLED SOME THE COUNCILMEMBERS TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THE OF THE PROCESS HOW IMPORTANT WAS AND. AND THE SAFETY OF THAT INFORMATION BUT. HAS THOUGH THE LEAGUE BEEN CUT YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH INFORMATION AND MAKING SURE REALLY THAT. PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE INUNDATED WITH WITH INFO. AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND WHAT ISN'T. SURVEY TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS ABSOLUTELY IN ALL THE INFORMATION IT WILL BE STANDING ON THE CENSUS WILL BE IMPORTANT YEAH. I AGREE. TO RECEIVE YOU YOU RAISE SOME GOOD GOOD POINTS OF. CHAIRMAN AND BELIEVE HAS BEEN HAS BEEN. PUSHING OUT INFORMATION TO OUR MEMBERS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THE LUKA PROCESS IS UNDERWAY TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT WHO THEY CAN. CONNECT WITH THEM CONTACT ABOUT HOW TO PARTICIPATE AND WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM DO THAT BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU RAISE A VERY GOOD POINT IN TERMS OF. THIS WHOLE NOTION OF TRUST IN HIM IN GOVERNMENT AND I THINK WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO HELP NOT ONLY EDUCATE FOLKS. ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF THE PROCESS BUT ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA HOW IT WILL BE USED AND HOW WILL NOT BE USEDYET SO WE'VE GOT MORE WORK MORE WORK TO DO THERE. THE IS THAT YOUR CARRY YEAH I JUST DONE ON ME. ONE OF THINGS LIKE AT. ALL OF THE MEMBERS WHAT ABOUT THE NON MEMBER CITY SINCE OUR WAY THAT WE CAN HELP REACH OUT IN SOME WAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S PLENTY THAT. DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN ONLY A CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND DID HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF COURSE MY IDEAS OF HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SO. AND CONCERNED ABOUT SOME AYE RURAL AREAS. THEY ALWAYS SAY WE NEVER GET ANYTHING WE DON'T GET ANYTHING FOR IT ON THE TABLE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THERE SO. HAS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION ON WHAT WE DO ABOUT NON MEMBER CITIES. WE WE HAVE. AYE HANDFUL OF NON MEMBER CITIES THAT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T IDENTIFY AND SUPPLEMENT BEEN OUTREACH TO THEM BUT I I THINK THE POINT YOU YOU REYES ALSO. A SPEAKS TO NATIVE AND NON ENGAGED MEMBER THAT PERSON DOESN'T OPEN. THE THAT THAT THE TEMPE MALE OR THE TWENTIETH EMAIL THAT MIGHT COME TO THEM. WE HAVE NOT CITED ANY SPECIFIC STRATEGIES YET TO A BETTER ENGAGE THEM. BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ON MY LIST. I FIND THIS HEARING IS GOOD POINT AND AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO TO. LET ALL OF US KNOW WHICH CITIES IN OUR DISTRICTS AREN'T MEMBERS I DON'T KNOW THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE WE CAN THEN REACH OUT TO THEM ALSO BECAUSE IT AYE THAT I KNEW REALIZE THAT. AND THAT'S A GREAT POINT. WHERE IF THE NON THE LESS THAN NOT GETTING THE INFO THEM AND WE CAN PUSH THAT INFO OUT TO THEM THEN THROUGH OUR CONTACTS ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO DO THEM THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I MENTIONED THE REGIONAL? PUBLIC AFFAIRS NETWORK THAT'S IN PLACE THAT LOOKED AT THE LAKE SO BESIDES THE RESOURCES PHYSICALLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE RESOURCES AND. A WHAT WE HAVE DIVIDED UP. SIXTEEN REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE WHO ARE A MORE FAMILIAR WILL BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH WHO IS RESPONDING WHO'S ENGAGED IN WHO WE NEED TO REACH. AND IT CERTAINLY REACH OUT YOUR DISTRICT OFFICES ON TO HELP MAKE YOU AWARE AS WELL GREAT. I THINK AT THE AGREE THAT THOSE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS NOT JUST YOUR BUT YEAH SEE SACCHETTI SHOULD BE REACHING UNDER WHICH WE WORKING TOGETHER BUT. I JUST ALWAYS HAVE SOME OF THE CITIES THAT ARE JUST. NON RESPONSIVE. MY LOOK FOR YOU HELPING US. MS PART YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF AND I WAS REALLY HEARTENED TO HEAR ABOUT HOW CREATIVE LA. COUNTY IS IS GETTING ERROR SIT YOU GO COUNTY AND CITY IT SOUNDS LIKE ARAB THEN AND THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO. HOW ARE THEIR PLANS HOW CAN WE? SHARE THAT INFORMATICS YOU FIND OUT WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT HOW CAN WE. YEAH SUFFERS THE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT TO SHARE IT TO THE OTHER FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS PROVIDE THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU WITH ALL OF OUR. THEY ARE DIFFERENT TEMPLATES MANNER USING HIM. IN ESTABLISHING OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES HOW TO DO A WORK PLAN. AND HOW TO SET THAT UP AND ALSO HOW TO DEVELOP ACTIVITY SHEETS FOR DOWN THE ROAD BUT WE ACTUALLY START ROLLING OUT EVENTS. AT PARKS AND LIBRARIES IN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. IS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE SCHEDULING CONFLICTS THAT WE MAKE SURE WE ARE FILLING THE GAP BETWEEN. SO BASICALLY THAT IS ONE MAJOR WAY THAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE JUST BASICALLY SHARE EVERYTHING WITH THE US CENSUS BUREAU WHOSE INTERN TRAINING. I THINK THEY'VE TRAINED A FEW COUNTIES ALREADY AND THERE CAN YOU. THE PRICE OF OTHER. TRAINING TEMPLATES THAT THEY'RE USING THAT THEY DEAD WE WEEPING GIVING ANYBODY WHO WANTS OUR INFORMATION IT'S IT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM PERFECT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THE US CENSUS BUREAU DO YOU HAVE A COPY DE THIS. YEAH. SORRY FOR THE UNSOLICITED PLUG. BUT THAT'S GREAT AGAIN AS WE DEFINITELY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT A LOT OF THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES A. LA COUNTY HAS AND AND DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF WORKING ON. THE CENSUS THAT SO IMPORTANT SO WE HAD YET A DIFFERENT ONE AT. THAT TAKE AS MUCH ADVANTAGE OF THE GOOD WORKS YOU'RE DOING IS POSSIBLE. AND THEN TO THE EXTENT I KNOW THAT OUR NEXT PANEL IS GOING TO BE ON COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS BUT MAYBE GET THEM IF YOU THAT'S WHY TELL US A LITTLE BIT DE. HOW IF IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH FOUNDATIONS OR CBO'S AND? HOW WE CAN HELP THOSE EFFORTS OR KIND OF WHAT PLANS YOU HAVE? SO. SEE PAN HAS INCLUDED US AT THE COMMUNITY TABLE ON. A WITH THEIR AND THEY'VE BEEN HAVING REGIONAL TABLES AYE TO DEVELOP THEIR GENERAL PLAN WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT. LATER. AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ON AS WELL AS OTHERS IS IDENTIFYING GAPS NAM. SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT. WHERE WE'RE LITERALLY GOING BLOCK BY BLOCK GROUP TO IDENTIFY WHAT CAN'T COVERAGE THEY CAN HANDLE? WE DON'T WANT FOLKS OVER PROMISING IN ENTER DELIVERING IN THE END OF THE DAY THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT CAN HELP OUT LIKE I SAID UNIONS. COUNTY EMPLOYEES. SO WORTH LOOKING AT THEIR CAPACITY WHAT'S WITHIN THEIR CAPACITY AND THEN HOW WE CAN HELP FILL THE GAPS SO IT'S A IT'S IT. A COMPLETE PICTURE AND THE COMPLETE. WAY OF ATTACKING THE. THE EFFORT. AND THE CAMPAIGN SO THAT'S REALLY. OUR PRIMARY EFFORT RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM AS THEY DEVELOP MORE AND MORE OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN AND HOW THEY WANT TO APPROACH. OUTREACH AND AND FIGURING OUT WITH THEM WE SEND THEM LISTS OF CBO'S THAT WE OBTAIN FROM OUR BOARD OFFICES FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO BE THE PERFECT MAN AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF OVER INTO THEIR COMMITTED TO OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT OUT THE VOTE. SO THERE'S GONNA BE LIMITATIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO ALL BE PITCHING IN TOGETHER BUT WE ARE VERY MUCH WORKING TOGETHER GREAT. GREAT I I WOULD JUST ADD FOR THE LEAGUE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN TWENTY TEN HOW WE WORK WITH A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS THAT END. UP FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS WE WILL REINVIGORATE OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS PER AND I WORK ACROSS THE STATE PERFECTLY FOR TO IT. THOUGHT WEBER. YEAH I TOOK A QUICK QUESTION YOU MENTIONED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROJECT IN LA COUNTY. AND THAT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THE TOTAL PROJECT ITSELF ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL. RIGHT TWENTY THAT'S MONEY THAT'S MAINLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW AND WE JUST AS I HAD ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE AROUND EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION BUT WITH THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION. WERE THINKING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO INCREASE THAT TO DO A MORE ROBUST OUTREACH AND WORKING. BOTH ON THE AIR IN ON THE GROUND WITHIN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PARTNERING WITH OUR OTHER CBO PARTNERS AND THAT TWELVE MILLION IS COMING FROM WHERE AT IT WHEREAS MEMBER THE BUDGET COMMITTEE YOU KNOW YEAH. WE'RE ASKING THAT WORK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING FROM THE STATE TWELVE MILLION YES AND THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTY. WELL YES THIS PART OF THE FIFTY OUT THAT BOTH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I TELL ALL WORK TOGETHER SO CERTAINLY LA COUNTY. JUST FOR THE CAN FOR LA COUNTY IS LOOKING FOR TWELVE MILLION WHICH WILL COME OUT OF THAT FIFTY OR WHATEVER THE FINAL. AMOUNT IS SO SOME OF US WANT MUCH MORE THAN FIFTY SO IF WELL WHAT THEY'VE HER AND SO DID I PUT IT INTO THE DIRE IT WELL IT IS THE PER THE CURRENT PERSPECTIVE IS. THAT THE STATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUT PROPOSED BUDGET HAS ONE MILLION STATEWIDE FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND TWO MILLION STATEWIDE FOR THE SECOND YEAR AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. IT'S NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DO. TO ADDRESS LA COUNTY AND IN PARTICULAR. AND PROBABLY OTHER COUNTY SINCE WELL BUT CERTAINLY FOR LA COUNTY IT'S NOT GOOD TO ALLOW US TO DO AS ROBUST AN EFFORT AS WE'D LIKE TO. HAS THERE BEEN A. AND AND MAYBE IT IS SOMEWHERE I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN THE BUDGET YET IS THEY'VE BEEN A BUDGET FIFTY YEAH I I. AM SAYING THIS BECAUSE EVERYBODY STILL ON THESE NUMBERS AROUND IN THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A COORDINATED. REQUEST OF THAT INCOME THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE COUNTIES ALL OF THE NUMBERS THAT I MEAN THIS STUFF WOULD DO IN THIS. THIS AFTERNOON IT REALLY US I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WHAT'S THE REALLY THE COST THAT AND THE EXPECTATION FROM THE STATE OF THE STATE OF FOR THE VARIOUS GROUPS THAT A PARTICIPATING? AND WE HEARD FIFTY IN SOME OF THE NUMBER I CAN'T REMEMBER. BUT. AND I'M JUST TRYING FIGURES A TWELVE AND FIFTY OF THIS TWELVE IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTY OR WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE NUMBER. YES I THINK HAVING THE STE WE ARE STILL TRYING TO GET A THAT A GOOD SENSE OF EXACTLY WHAT THAT OVERALL MORE THE AND OLD THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY NEED IS. IN TERMS OF A DOLLAR FIGURE AND I KNOW. I THINK THERE WAS A. PROPOSAL FROM ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE FOR SIXTY SEVEN MILLION AT WHICH I THINK WAS. THE IDENTIFIED IN THE IN THE. CAO BUDGET DOCUMENT AS AS ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL. NEEDED SO THAT THE TOTAL WAS GOING TO BE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WAS WHAT THEY IDENTIFIED AND BUT ONLY FUNDING A THIRD OF IT. THAT AT THIS STAGE THAT IS STILL BEING DISCUSSED IN THE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SO THAT'S A THIS IS A LIVE CONVERSATION. THAT I THINK YOU ALL WILL BE HAVING MORE. OVER THEN GO OVER THIS WEEK. YES PLEASE. I. I TRAVEL HISTORY. QUESTION SO IN TWO THOUSAND ODYSSEY LOS ANGELES HEAD OUT SENSES ARE. I JAN PERRY. AND SHE. DID EFFORTS IT WOULDN'T IF DO YOU ANYBODY KNOW WHERE FUNDING CAME FOR THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE HAD TO SEE OF LA OTHER. A ROBUST PROGRAM AND WE PUT A LOT OF ENERGY AND EFFORT INTO IT. AND I NEVER KNEW I WAS FUND I THOUGHT IT CAME FROM THE GENERAL FUND BUT I'M NOT. IF YOU HAVE I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS HOW THE CITY FUNDED THE BUDGET FOR FOR TWO THOUSAND. AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING THIS TIME IS A SITTING COUNTY OR ACTUALLY PARTNERED TOGETHER AND. WHERE IS IN THE LAST CENSUS I THINK THE CITY HAD ITS ROADMAP IN THE COUNTY HAD ITS ROMANCE SO ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT'S GOING ON NOW IS WE ARE PARTNERED? BUT I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE CITY BUDGET WAS I'M I DO YOU KNOW THAT. THE STATE ALLOCATION TO THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN TWENTY TEN AND I THINK IT WAS AROUND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR ALL EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES FOR US TO SHARE WITH ALL EIGHTEEN CITIES SO WAS. FAIRLY SMALL ALLOCATION BUT AND THAT WAS TO THE FACT THAT. THE STATE WAS IN RECESSION SO. OKAY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PAINTED A GREAT JOB OF KEEPING US THE ON TIME AND THEN AS SOON AS HE HANDED OVER TO ME WE WENT OFF TRACK. BUT NONE THAT I KNOW THIS IS GREAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. AND AND. SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. GROUP THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS. AND. FIRST WE HAVE DANIELS AND GOLLY SENIOR VP AT HOW OF HEALTHY CALIFORNIA AT THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT. JOHN DAHLE BIRD DOBAR TO THE US CENSUS POLICY ADVOCATES IN NETWORKING ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF POLITICAL VOICE AT THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT CALIFORNIA. ANDREA GUERRERO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE IN DIEGO AND DANIEL EACH IN A SAY. PROJECT DIRECTOR DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PROJECT AT ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY. SURE AND. MISUSING GOLLY IF YOU WANT TO KICK US OFF. SURE GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. SOUGHT THE REASON I'M SITTING IN THIS CHAIR IS BECAUSE THERE ARE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT DANIEL SINGLE BUT THERE IS NO CALIFORNIA CENSUS FOUNDATION. SO OTHER FOUNDATIONS LIKE OURS OURS A HEALTH FOUNDATION. I GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW WE INTERRUPT OUR NORMAL COURSE OF BUDGETING IN BUSINESS EVERY TEN YEARS. HOW TO TRY TO STEP UP AS BEST WE CAN TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON THIS? AND WE DEBATED THIS IS AT OUR BOARD THIS YEAR. AS A HEALTH FOUNDATION OBVIOUSLY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. FEDERAL RESOURCES ABOUT I CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATION. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY THE BOARD RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH THEN THEIR SENSE OF AGENCY OR BELONGING. HOW WE ACTUALLY WENT TO THE DICTIONARY AND LOOK TO THE WORD COUNT? AND YOU SEE THINGS LIKE ASSIGNING WORTH OR DESERVING OF CONSIDERATION. AND THE OPPOSITE ACCOUNT ARE YOU FIND WORDS LIKE TO EXCLUDE ACCOUNT HOW. SO WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS AS OUR SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND BOARD THE THOUGHT OF FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FOURTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS. BEING COUNTED OUT. POSES A VERY SERIOUS THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO THE. A HEALTH OF OUR STATE. I'M JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF FLAVOR OF THAT THERE FOLKS HERE WITH MORE EXPERTISE THAN I HAVE. BITE PARA MILLION OF THOSE AT RISK FOR BEING UNDER COUNTED ARE BLACK CALIFORNIANS FIVE MILLION ARE LATINO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NATIVE AMERICANS. SO HAD THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY. POPULATIONS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DISPARATE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND POPULATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. I'M. I WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M GLAD MEMBERS EARLIER MENTIONED THE ACA UNCOVERED CALIFORNIA EFFORT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS. THERE THAT REALLY YOU CAN'T FIND IN PREVIOUS CENSUS. FRANKLY IN PREVIOUS CENSUS WE HAD OVER PERCEIVED A GOOD FAITH PARTNERS IN DC. BUT WHEN THE ACA LAUNCHED IN CALIFORNIA IT WAS VERY TOXIC POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAND YOU'LL REMEMBER THE DEATH PANELS. AND OTHER NEGATIVITY SO WE HAD TO OVERCOME A LOT OF THAT EVEN HEARING CALIFORNIA AMONG PEOPLES PERCEPTIONS. AND IT WAS IT TOOK A HERCULEAN EFFORT THE ENDOWMENT ALONE SPEND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ARE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. TO COUNTER SOME OF THAT NEGATIVITY AND GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP AND FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT. I'M BUT I DID LIKE YOUR QUESTION EARLIER MISTER JONES SAWYER ABOUT WHAT DIDN'T WORK. AND SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE ACA. AS WELL AND A COUPLE OF THINGS CAME TO MIND YOU KNOW WE WERE VERY EXCITED AT THE LAUNCH OF THAT EFFORT. THAT WE COULDN'T CONVINCE DR OZ TO MAKE IT OUT FOR US. AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T ALL THE MESSAGE TESTING TYPE PERSUASIVE MESSAGES MESSENGERS AND HE WAS OFF THE CHARTS AT THAT TIME. AND DO YOU KNOW HE TO HIS CREDIT HE FLEW OUT HAD NEVER TAKEN A POSITION ON THE AC TO THAT POINT. HE MADE THE AD. ABA WHAT WE DISCOVERED OVER THE COURSE OF THAT EFFORT IS THAT THERE WERE THINGS WERE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE FOR EXAMPLE THE MULTI ETHNIC MEDIA INVESTMENTS WE MADE. PRODUCED MORE AND SOME UNCONVENTIONAL THINGS TO GO TO SOME QUESTIONS EARLIER. IN THE WEEK THAT THE MONEY WE PUT INTO BARBERSHOP NETWORKS THE NUMBER OF THE DOLLARS THAT WE PUT INTO. A WRESTLER'S ASSOCIATION ON YOU TUBE AND GIVES A VERY UNCONVENTIONAL THINGS ENDED UP DELIVERING SOME SURPRISING RESULTS. HOW AM I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? I'M BLESSING ALL MENTIONED AND I THINK YOU'RE SO WISE TO HAVE HAD DIRECTOR BROUGH HERE I LEARNED A LOT HAVE DIRECTOR FROM HEARING THE HISTORY. BUT WHAT REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND HOW THAT HASN'T CHANGED OVER THE DECADES. AND SO I'M HONORED TO BE SURROUNDED HEREBY TODAY'S TRUSTED MESSENGERS. VETERANS OF THEM A CALL THEMSELVES THE BOBBY SEALE OF TODAY. BUT THEY ARE THE FOLKS WHO COMMUNITIES TRUST. AND ONE OF THE MAIN LESSONS FROM RACF AT EFFORT WAS THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE IN PERSON. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IS REALLY WHAT DESERT DELIVERED THAT THE RESULTS WE BELIEVE THAT WILL BE THE CASE AGAIN. AND WE STAND READY TO BE PARTNERS WITH THE STATE OF AYE GOOD I WANNA REMIND YOU THAT MUCH LESSON FROM A CA WAS WHEN THE STATE STEPPED UP AND SHOW THAT YOU'RE SERIOUS. AND WOULD MAKE A ROBUST INVESTMENT THAT'S REALLY WHAT BROUGHT PLAN TO BE A LONG. THANK YOU. MR DOT ORG. THE MORNING. CHAIRMAN BERMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF. THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ASSURING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES WHAT IT CAN. TO ACHIEVE A FAIR AND ACCURATE COUNT OF OUR STATE POPULATION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. MY NAME IS JOHN DOE BARGAIN ON THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE POLITICAL VOICE PROGRAM AT AT VASSAR PROJECT CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS A MULTI RACIAL CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS ALONGSIDE COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO TRANSFORM PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND SHIFT INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE RACIAL EQUITY. I'M HERE TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF IT OF EVENTS APPROACH CALIFORNIA AND THE CENSUS POLICY ADVOCACY NETWORK OR SEE PAN. SEE PAN IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AMONG MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO EDUCATE. POLICY MAKERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS ABOUT THE. SOUND POLICIES AND GOVERNMENT INVESTMENTS NEEDED. FOR A A COMPLETE DEL OF OUR STATE. WHERE DIVERSE COALITION OF GROUPS OF THE HAS DEEP EXPERIENCE? WORKING WITH HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE. SUCH AS AFRICAN AMERICANS ASIAN AMERICANS LATINOS NATIVE AMERICANS PACIFIC ISLANDERS. LGBTQ PEOPLE AMERICAN MUSLIMS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CHILDREN IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. EYES OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS WILL BE UNLIKE ANY OTHER IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FACES MANY CHALLENGES AND TRYING TO ACHIEVE OF A AN ACCURATE COUNT. ACHIEVING THAT COUNT. AND OVERCOMING THOSE THOSE CHALLENGES IS GONNA REQUIRED THAT WE BUILD A ROBUST OUTREACH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT WE TAKE A MULTI SECTOR APPROACH TO. ENCOURAGING AND EDUCATING CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY. WHAT'S THE PENT ESTIMATES HIS IS A MINIMUM OF FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION HARD TO COUNT CALIFORNIANS ENCOURAGING IN EDUCATING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SENSE THAT. COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS OF CBO'S ARE GONNA PLAY A VITAL ROLE. IN THAT MULTI SECTOR EFFORT. AND THAT ROLE WILL BE TO SERVE AS TRUSTED MESSAGES. AS. TRUSTED MESSENGERS CBO'S WILL. ONE. EDUCATE COMMUTER RESIDENTS ABOUT THE CENSUS TO VALIDATE CENSUS RELATED MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNMENT. A THREE ASSIST COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND FOR OVERALL ALLEVIATE ANXIETY ABOUT RESPONDING TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE. OR CENSUS BUREAU ENUMERATORS. SEALS WILL DO THIS YOU TARGETED OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS THAT WILL OUR THAT IS. CAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO BE IN VERY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIES TARGETING VERY SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. AND THEY WILL RECEIVE POPULATIONS THROUGH VARIOUS ACTIVITIES SUCH AS DOOR TO DOOR CANVASSING A DIGITAL CAMPAIGNS TO TWO SMARTPHONES SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGES. DESERVING OF LOCATIONS AND AND AND STAFFING FOR ASSISTANCE CENTERS OR KIOSKS. TRAIL. MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT IN LANGUAGE. AND. TRAIN THE TRAINER ACTIVITY SO MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT CBO WILL BE ENGAGED IN. ARE THE SEE THE CBO CAMPAIGNS WILL NOT ONLY ALLEVIATE ANXIETY ABOUT THE CENSUS AMONG HARD TO COUNT RESIDENTS. THEY ALSO ENABLE COUNTIES AND CITIES TO BE MORE STRATEGIC ABOUT THEIR OWN OUTREACH. WHERE CBO THE NONPROFIT INFRASTRUCTURE OUR PRESIDENT AND WILL RESOURCE? TO DO OUTREACH COUNTIES AND CITIES. POTENTIALLY HAVE LEFT TO DO AND CAN DIRECT A MORE INTENSIVE AGENCY OUTREACH TO AREAS WERE SUCH ORGANIZATIONS IN INFRASTRUCTURE DON'T EXIST. THIS TYPE OF COORDINATED APPROACH IS ALREADY UNDERWAY IN LA COUNTY AND WE HOPE TO SEE MORE OF IT IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. OF SUCH AN APPROACH IS THE BEST WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE SOME PRESIDENT IT'S IT'S IT'S SENSELESS. AND RECEIVE THE THE FEDERAL FUNDING IN CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION WE DESERVE. THANK YOU AND OF THE FOUR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS GUERRA. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BERMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I'M ANDREA GET IT ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ALLIANCE SAN DIEGO. A COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT ORGANIZATION. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WORKING TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE. DEMOCRACY AND PART OF THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE FEELS COUNTED. SAN DIEGO AS YOU MAY KNOW IS THE SECOND LARGEST COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A SECOND LARGEST ELECTORATE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S ALSO THE SECOND LARGEST HARD TO COUNT AREA IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A DIVERSE AREA. I THAT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF REFUGEES AND AS WELL AS IMMIGRANTS THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED LANGUAGES SPOKEN WE ARE THE LARGEST REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. WE ALSO HAVE THE THE DUBIOUS. DISTINCTION OF BEING THE LARGEST COUNTY HURT THAT WHERE THE A COUNTY THAT SAW THE LARGEST DROP. IN THE EMAIL PARTICIPATION RATE. BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY TWENTY I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN SAN DIEGO COUNTY SUBTLE LARGEST DROP IN PARTICIPATION BETWEEN. TWO THOUSAND AND AT SITE TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. CLUBS UP HAVE HAVE DO WELL ON IT YET BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWENTY TEN GOING TO BRING IT UP TWENTY TWENTY. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT WE DO WANT TO BRING IT UP OF WHICH IS WHY IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE. THAT SAN DIEGO WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ITS FAIR SHARE. A WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT. LAST DROWNED IN THE BAY AREA AND IN LOS ANGELES AND RIGHTLY SO BUT WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT SAN DIEGO IS IS NOT FORGOTTEN IN THE EQUATION BECAUSE AS YOU RIGHTLY POINTED OUT. TURN BERMAN THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS SIGNIFICANT AND WE DON'T WANNA. WE DON'T WANNA CUT OUR OF OUR INVESTMENT SHORE IN SAN DIEGO. SO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE FACED IN SAN DIEGO IN IN THE CONDUCTING A CENSUS AND. TWENTY TEN WAS DOES THE CHALLENGE OF THE FEAR. FACED BY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN SAN DIEGO AS IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN FOUR. RESIDENTS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE FOREIGN BORN IMMIGRANTS AND THEY OFTEN LIVE IN MIXED STATUS FAMILIES I AM AMONG THOSE. AS THOSE FAMILIES INCLUDE CITIZENS LEGAL RESIDENTS AND UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXED STATUS FAMILIES YOU ARE VERY HESITANT. TO DISCLOSE WHO'S IN YOUR HOUSE. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO FEAR ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY HOW THE INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. TO THE FLOOR BOTHERED FORMERLY INCARCERATED COMMITTEE TO THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY AND OTHERS. AND SO WE WE KNOW THAT THESE CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE EXACERBATED GOING INTO TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE RHETORIC FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. SO WHAT DID WE DO IN TWENTY TRENT TEN THAT WE THOUGHT WORKED WELL WE DID GET RESOURCES FROM CALIFORNIAN DOWNMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE WERE ABLE TO CONDUCT OUTREACH TO ROUGHLY SIXTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE AREA. TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PARTICIPATION THESE WARRANTS IN HARD TO COUNT AREAS OF OUR COUNTY. A WE ALSO RAN BUS ADS AND I WON THE LIFT THAT UP BECAUSE BUS ADS THROUGH. HIGH DENSITY AREAS WITH HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS WAS A GREAT WAY TO ELEVATE THE AWARENESS. A IN THE POPULATION NOW IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEND OUR MONEY TO DO THAT OR YOUR MONEY AS A WATER. OF BUT IT'S IT WE HAD STATE RESOURCES OR LOCAL RESOURCES TO PAY FOR THOSE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES. THAT WOULD BE GRANT. A IN AND SO WE WERE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN DOING OUR OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY AND THAT WAS BECAUSE OF ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WITH A COMMUNITY. THAT'S BEEN SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN HERE BUT OUR ORGANIZATION AND OTHERS LIKE OURS. WE ARE VALUE ADDED IN THIS EQUATION IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST THAT WE HAVE. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO PARTNER WITH US EARLY AS EARLY AS YOU CAN. BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE RESOURCES IN SAN DIEGO. WERE NOT ENOUGH OF WE. WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CONCERTED EFFORT. TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE OF WE HAD THE LARGEST DROP IN PARTICIPATION FROM ONE CENSUS TO THE NEXT. AND SO IF YOU ASK ME WHAT YOU SHOULD DO GOING FORWARD I WOULD SAY WHICH ALREADY DOING AND AND THAT IS TO START EARLY. INVEST MORE. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH TRUSTED PARTNERS. IN ALL OF THE HARD TO COUNT AREAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHIN UP. OUR THANK CHAIRMAN. INDISTINCT MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES. MY NAME IS THAT YOU KNOW SAYING AND I DIRECT THE DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PROJECT AND SINCE INFORMATION CENTER EDITION AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE LOS ANGELES OF THE NATION'S LARGEST. LEGAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS SERVING ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. FOUNDED NEARLY THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO I ADVANCING JUSTICE IS HELP LEAD DECENNIAL CENSUS OUTREACH EFFORTS TARGETING OUR COMMUNITIES. ON SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ON SERVING AS A HUB FOR A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF FIVE. DIVERSE COMMUNITY PARTNERS I'M WORKING TO ENCOURAGE RESPONSE DURING THE NIGHT THE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TEN CENTS. OF THE DECENNIAL CENSUS IS IMPORTANT TO ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN WAYS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT ALL CALIFORNIANS I'M IT'S CRITICAL TO FOUR OUT TO OUR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. AND OUR FAIR SHARE FEDERAL STATE. AND LOCAL FUNDS ARM FOR COMMUNITIES SUCH AS OURS EXPERIENCING RAPID GROWTH ARMS AS IF THEY ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TOOL TO ENSURE. ON THAT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROGRAMS BOTH UNDERSTAND. AND ARE RESPONSIVE TO UP OUR DIVERSE POPULATIONS I'M ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT CENSUS BUREAU ESTIMATES THERE OVER SIX POINT SIX MILLION I'M ASIAN AMERICANS AND NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE STATEWIDE. UNTIL HOPE NO STATE IS HOME TO MORE ASIAN AMERICANS. AND ONLY THE STATE OF HAWAII IS HOME TO MORE PACIFIC ISLANDERS. ON THESE LARGE POPULATIONS ARE CALIFORNIA'S FASTEST GROWING ON SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND TEN CENSUS UMNO COMMUNITIES HAVE GROWN FASTER. THAT GROWTH IS BEING DRIVEN BY IMMIGRATION ARM APPROXIMATELY SIXTY PERCENT OF ASIAN AMERICANS. I'M SIX ZERO ARE IN TWENTY PERCENT OF PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE FOREIGN BORN SO NO COMMUNITIES PROPORTIONALLY ARE MORE FOREIGN BORN THE NATION AMERICANS. I'M ARE OVERWHELMINGLY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. ARE ETHNICALLY CULTURALLY. AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE FACING CHALLENGES. WITH LANGUAGE BARRIERS SO ALL THIS MAKES OUR COMMUNITIES. HARD TO COUNT. ON TO ENSURE COMPLETE COUNT OF AYE ASIAN AMERICANS PACIFIC ISLANDERS OF STATEWIDE WE NEED TO DO THINGS LIKE A ONE DEVELOPMENT TEST MESSAGES I'M RECOGNIZING THAT NO ONE MESSAGE. WILL WORK FOR ALL OUR COMMUNITIES ONTO DEVELOPING TRANSLATE OUT WHICH MATERIALS AND PSAS WHAT WE KNOW WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE MEANT THREE SUB GRANT TO AND TRAIN. CAMILLE ORGANIZATIONS WHO WILL ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AS TRUSTED MESSENGERS AS FOLKS HAVE FUN IDENTIFIED. ON BUT MOST CRITICALLY ALL OF THIS IS TO BE DONE. IN DOZENS OF ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LANGUAGES AND I WANT TO FLAG FOR BOTH COMMITTEES ON THAT THE CENSUS BUREAU CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE PLANS ON TO PRODUCE ANY TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS OUR RESOURCES IN PACIFIC ISLANDER LANGUAGES SO THAT ZERO. AND WE KNOW THAT THE PACIFIC ON A COMMUNITY WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST COUNTY TWENTY TEN. ENCLOSING Y. WE BELIEVE THAT SUBCOMMITTEE PARTNERSHIPS ARE CRITICAL. TO THE SUCCESS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS ARM WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY I'M OBVIOUSLY WE WANT PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY. NOT BEHIND A DESK DEALING WITH BURDEN SOME ARE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. BUT COUNT ABILITY IS NOTHING NEW TO THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK. CLEARING QUANTIFIABLE DELIVERABLES ARE IMPORTANT OF PROPHECIES FOR INFORMATION GATHERING THAT ALLOW FOR SHIPS IN THE WORK. TO ADDRESS CHANGING CONDITIONS IN EMERGING AYE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT ON STRUCTURING SUB GRANTING TO COMMITTEE PARTNERS ARM IN INSTALLMENTS MAINTAINS ENGAGEMENT. ARMS SO THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE ON WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. TO COUNT EVERY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ANY QUESTIONS FROM FROM COLLEAGUES SO I GUESS. SO THEY ARE CBO THEN A PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY ARE GONNA BE SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. SIX IN THIS EFFORT NOW HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WITH THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY AND AND WE'LL HAVE MORE. LATER TODAY. WHITE AND AND RESEARCH YOU KNOW SAY YOU KNOW YOU YOU RIGHTFULLY. MENTION THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY BUT NOT TO OVER THE OWNERS REGULATION. WHAT? YEAH I GUESS IT DIDN'T ME THIS IS AN UNFAIR QUESTION ASKED WHAT'S THE BEST WAY. TO IT TO ENSURE THAT AND EIGHT GIVEN THAT THIS CAN BE MONEY BEING SPENT BY THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS. RELATIONSHIPS WITH WITH DIFFERENT CBO'S IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN. THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S GONNA BE SPENDING MORE THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE. ON OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION EFFORT AND KEY INCLUDING FUNDING LOCAL EFFORTS THROUGH CBO'S. DO YOU WHAT WOULD YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ON WHAT THE BEST WAY IS TO TO EXECUTE ON THAT MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE MONEY SPENT EFFECTIVELY. ONE ONE IMPORTANT PIECE WILL BE THE ADMINISTRATIVE CBO PIECE WHICH. SOUGHT TO THOUSAND THE STATE CONTRACT WITH ADMINISTRATIVE CBO THAT THEN SUBCONTRACTING TO LOCAL FEELS COUSIN AND DOES ADMINISTRATIVE CBO'S HAD. HOPPED ON A LARGE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING. WHAT THE LOCAL CBO THEY'RE DOING AND ALSO DISTRIBUTING THEM THE MONEY SO? FORT TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE WAY TO ENSURE. THAT'S A GOOD. GIVEN THE SCALE AND THE AMOUNT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE NUMBER OF IT ADMINISTRATIVE CBO'S WOULD NEED TO BE LARGER BUT ARE JUST HAVING THOSE IN PLACE WOULD BE ONE KEY PIECE JOHN. MASON THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES MANY OF. OUR. PARTNERS WHO WE CAN WORK ON THE GROUND OR SMALLER RIGHT I MEAN HE'S A SMALLER ORGANIZATION SERVING SMALLER COMMUNITIES BUT REALLY CRITICAL VOICES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. I'M SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE THINGS LIKE CLEAR DELIVERABLES QUANTIFIABLE DELIVERABLES. BUT ALSO NOT. ONEROUS REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT DOWN THAT THESE OR THE SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS MAYBE I. CHALLENGED THEIR WITH SO. I DON'T KNOW IT WAS DEVELOPMENT ORDER FOR NONPROFIT WE JUST DIDN'T BOTHER TRYING TO GET GOVERNMENT GRANTS. BECAUSE THEY THE APPLICATION PROCESS WAS SO. AND WE'LL THE CHAIR THERE. YEAH AND I THINK YOU CAN ALSO LOOK TO LARRY NON TO EXISTING GRANT STRUCTURES THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE FOR EXAMPLE TO THE ONE CALIFORNIA GRANT PROCESS. THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THERE IS ALREADY A TAPESTRY OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GETTING GRANT FUNDING TO DO IMMIGRANT OUTREACH YEAH AND THAT IS ONE OF THE HARDEST. COMMUNITIES TO REACH AND SO I AND THAT'S ALSO A MODEL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S LESS ONEROUS AND SOME OF THE OTHER GRANT STRUCTURES THAT THE STATE HAS. A MIGHT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO LOOK WHAT ABOUT THIS. DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY. YEAH EVALUATION PIECE. WERE EXAGGERATE HOW RELIABLE YOU REALLY THINK THAT IS BUT WELL OUR CONFIDENCE HAS BOOSTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU ALL HAVE SOME OF MY DDS AND DANIEL AND OTHERS WHO. HAVE A HISTORY OF EXPERIENCE AND THEY KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF COURSE CORRECTING AS YOU GO THEY KNOW THAT THE. VALUE OF OF KEEPING COUNT YOU CAN ACTUALLY WATCH IN REAL TIME WHERE THINGS ARE SUCCEEDING IN NOT MAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS BUT. AGAIN JUST AYE MY ADVICE TO YOU FROM COMING FROM OUR SECTOR IS. DON'T DON'T GET TOO OBSESSIVE ABOUT SARAH PUTTING THESE ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH LOTS OF A FORMAL EVALUATIONS AND CONSTANT. REPORTING BECAUSE THEN THAT TAKES AWAY FROM ACTUALLY GETTING THE JOB DONE SIR GUN DEFEATS THE PURPOSE HIM. WILL THINK ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. AT THIS STAGE I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING LOTS OF CONVERSATION TO MOVE FORWARD. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO GET THE RESOURCES TO TO DISTRIBUTE ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDED ON THE SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO HAS SOME PRETTY. PRETTY PRETTY GET. REPRESENTATIVES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. YES. THEY WILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IT'S A WIN TO MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WE DIDN'T. DO A SIGN IN SHEET SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT JUST PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE IN THE MIDDLE IF YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ABOUT ONE MINUTE PER PERSON THAT WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATED. AS WE GET BACK ON TRACK. IF YOU TO SAY. YOUR NAME AND IF YOU'RE REPRESENTING AN ORGANIZATION WOULD ORGANIZATION I REGRET. HI MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AYE JULIE SNYDER REPRESENTING HOUSING CALIFORNIA WE ARE A MEMBER OF CP ON THE CENSUS POLICY ADVANCEMENT NETWORK OR ADVOCACY NETWORK SORRY AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE.

AS HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO HELP LEAD OUR ECA OUT OUTREACH EFFORTS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN. REITERATING SOME OF WHAT WAS SAID BEFORE I THINK SOME OF THE. KEY REASONS THAT WORKED WELL WAS THE COMBINATION OF PHILANTHROPY WE WORK VERY CLOSELY THE CALIFORNIA NOW MEANT. THE STATE COVERED CALIFORNIA WAS A BIG PARTNER. LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CBO'S WERE KEY TO THE EFFORT BUT AS WELL AS MEDIA WE HAD A GREAT MEDIA COALITION OF SPANISH LANGUAGE MEDIA GROUPS TV RADIO.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOANNE FIELDS FROM SAN DIEGO I REPRESENT THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER INITIATIVE. AND I HAVE THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING WORKED AS A RECRUITING ASSISTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ALSO THE PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST TO OUT WHICH THE. NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AND ASIAN COMMUNITIES ALLOW EVERYONE IS VYING TO SAY THAT THEY ARE THE HARDEST OUT COUNTY TO COUNT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PITCH FOR SAN DIEGO. BEING IN THE BORDER REGION THAT. WE WE HAVE THAT CONCERN OF THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION HOW MY NO THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP OFTEN BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BRING THE CONCERN OF CYBERSECURITY. NOW THAT WE ARE GOING ON LINE AND HOW ARE WE ALSO GOING TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE DIDN'T OUT FUND AYE INTERNET RADIO STATIONS.

I AM INTERNET RADIO STATIONS LIKE ISLAND BLOCK HAS ANALYTICS OF FOUR MILLION AND REACH OUT WE ALSO HAVE SMALLER. STATIONS. IN THE LOCAL AREA K. B. L. QUE THAT HAS A REACH IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SO WHY WE SAY THAT THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS BUT I DO WANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO THAT. ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER ESPECIALLY THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY I DON'T THINK THE COMMUNITY REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT UMBRELLA AND TAILS.

HALF OUR FILIPINO SO WHEN WE LOOK FOR THE MESSAGING PLEASE DON'T FORGET THE SMALLER PAPERS LIKE OUR OLDEST AND LARGEST PAPER THE FILIPINO PRESS BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD WHEN BURKE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE COMPETING. WHEN IT COMES TO MEDIA DOLLARS AN OUTREACH BECAUSE AGAIN.
