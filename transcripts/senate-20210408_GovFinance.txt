PUBLIC EDUCATION WHETHER IT'S HIGHER RATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU SEE CSU SYSTEM A VERY CRITICAL BOND BILL THAT IS COMING FOR TODAY MISTER SENATOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WE WELCOME YOU COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR ALLOW ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL SB TWENTY TWO WOULD AUTHORIZE A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BOND FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BALLOT. FOR FACILITIES FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY THE BOND INCLUDES NINE BILLION FOR PRESCHOOL THROUGH GRADE TWELVE. AND TWO BILLION H. FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THE LAST K. THROUGH TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION BOND PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. HOWEVER BY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ALL THOSE FUNDS WERE ESSENTIALLY EXHAUSTED. THIS PART IS CRITICAL FOR BRINGING ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. K. THROUGH TWELVE THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND ENSURING OUR CHILDREN OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND SAFE PLACES TO LEARN. THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR SAFE SCHOOLS AND CAMPUS FACILITIES TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND STAFF. CURRENTLY MANY SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT BUILDING SPACE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE RE OPENING. GUIDELINES ON SMALLER CLASS SIZES. TO GET THE CONSTRUCTION UP. AND- REPAIRS ARE NEEDED TO CREATE LARGER CLASSROOMS IMPROVE VENTILATION SYSTEMS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION AND SHARED SPACES. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT IT WOULD COST OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO MODERNIZE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN THE NEXT DECADE. WE NEED TO DO OUR BEST TO HELP OUR STUDENTS WE DID HAVE A DISAPPOINTING LOSS IN THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION BUT I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT IN NOVEMBER VOTERS APPROVED. SIXTY LOCAL SCHOOL BOND MEASURES- ASSUMING THEY DECIDED ON SIXTY THE APPROVED YOU IS AN EXTENSION OF COMPROMISES THAT WERE REACHED LAST YEAR ON THE MEASURE THAT WAS ON LAST YEAR'S BALLOT. THERE ARE STILL CONVERSATIONS GOING ON IN DISCUSSIONS WITH LEADERSHIP IN THE GOVERNOR AND STAKEHOLDERS- THIS BILL ADVANCING TODAY WITH YOUR APPROVAL. ALLOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO CONTINUE IT WOULD ALLOW THE SENATE TO STAND UP FOR THE IMPORT IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR UNIVERSITY. I WANNA DOLLARS THE CHAIR- WHO IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE MEASURE TODAY I HAVE JASON MURPHY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SENATOR AGAIN NO B. S.

APPLE PLANS TO PLANT IN A FIVE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN UNFUNDED CAPITAL AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. OF THIS AMOUNT. TWENTY ONE BILLION. IS THE VET. AT STAY SUPPORT. EDUCATION AND GENERAL FACILITY PROJECT. THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY A FEW TWENTY TWO WOULD GREATLY AFFECT THE UNIVERSITY IN DEVELOPING THESE UNFUNDED PROJECTS THAT WILL FOCUS ON ACCOMMODATING ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND RENEWAL OF EXISTING FACILITIES INCLUDING SEISMIC CORRECTIONS. IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST NOTE- BUT A REFERENCE ON PAGE FIVE TWO- THE LEASE. REVENUE OR I'M SORRY THE REVENUE BOND ACROSS THE DIVERSITY DOES HAVE ADDED OPTION TO UTILIZE THIS WAS PROVIDED- BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. AS A RESULT OF AB NINETY FOUR.

WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BACK FILLING AND SEALING THE ENTIRE PROCESS TAKES HOURS THANK KARSTEN DRIVE ON THE ROADS IN THE SAME DAY. MICHAEL JOHNSON IS TYPICALLY THAN TRADITIONAL OPEN TRENCH ST EXCAVATIONS WHICH CREE LANE CLOSURES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT NEIGHBORHOODS. PSYCHOLOGY IS BEING USED ENTITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED IN LOS ANGELES FOR OVER THIRTY MILES OF FIBER HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN RECENT MONTHS USING THIS TECHNIQUE. NO NECESSARY BECAUSE MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE HESITANT TO UTILIZE THIS NEWER TECHNOLOGY THAT CITY STAFF ARE USED TO BE OLDER MORE DISRUPTIVE METHOD OF OPEN TRENCHING. MY PROTECTION COMPLIES WITH ALL UTILITY SAFETY RULES AND GOES FURTHER BY USING GROUND PENETRATING RADAR PRIOR TO INSTALLATION. FASTER INSTALLATION OF FIBER MEANS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE CAN GET CONNECTED TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. IN DAYS INSTEAD OF MONTHS. THIS WILL ALSO COMPLEMENT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR BROADBAND BY ENSURING THAT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS OR MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT RESIDENTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

FROM STOCKTON AT CENTER EGGMAN TO BE A PRESENT SB FOUR TWENTY SEVEN A CRITICAL ISSUE ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO THE DRAFT CENTER EGGMAN FORESHORES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND- AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WATER ONE OF OUR MOST VALUABLE RESOURCES- AND BACK VOTE SO VALUABLE THAT IT IT IS OFTEN THE- THE NUMBER OF SUBJECT IS A WORD. BUT THE ITEM OF THEFT- THERE'S MORE WATER THEFT THAT OCCURS THAN WE MAY REALIZE WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT S. B. FOUR TWENTY SEVEN I'D LIKE TO START OUT BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE AND- THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR ALL THEIR WORK. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO ENHANCE THE PENALTIES FOR WATER THEFT AS IT POSES A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS A SAFETY RISK EVERY TIME A NON POTABLE SOURCE IS A LEGALLY CONNECTED TO DRINKING WATER SYSTEM THERE'S A CHANCE OF IT CONTAMINATING THE WHOLE WATER SOURCE. THIS MIGHT SEEM ODD TO YOU THAT SOMEBODY WOULD DO THIS- BUT YET THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY GOING WITH THE BIG HOSE AND CONNECTING TO A FIRE HYDRANT AND THEN BE ABLE TO USE IT IN SOME KIND OF COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES A- THE COST THE PENALTY FOR. STEALING AT THAT WATER IS LESS THAN IT WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY. COOK UP LEGALLY TO THAT WATER SYSTEM- THIS BILL IS AN- AND- TO OUR WATER SYSTEMS. AND WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE. OF CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE CURRENT PENALTIES ARE SIMPLY NOT DETERRING WATER THEFT THEY ARE SET AS LOW AS ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD OFFENSE. RESPECTIVELY IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. WATER AGENCIES HAVE WITNESSED ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS TO HYDRANTS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT AND WITHOUT A PERMIT. IT PENALTIES FALL FAR BELOW WHAT IT WOULD COST TO DO IT YOURSELF- DESPITE THE NEED TO DETER THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO ALLOW FOR PUNITIVE PENALTIES- AND IN FACT MOST OF THESE PENALTIES ARE NOT TOWARDS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO GET CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO THEIR HOME. THIS IS FOR MORE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES THAT OCCUR. WE THINK THIS BILL STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN- MAKING URE WEEK WE KEEP OUR OUR WATER SYSTEM MAINTAINED AND THEN. HAVING THE FINES BE. DETERRENT ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE WILL WILL STOP ILLEGALLY CONNECTING UP. I AM TOO AB TWO WATER SYSTEMS. AND WE THINK THIS BILL STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE IN WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IS RYAN- ME. FROM THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY AND- SOMEONE FROM ONE OF MY- FUTURE LIFE AS A CITY COUNCILMEMBER. MARC MEDICINE WITH THE L. GROUP WATER DISTRICT. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING SENATOR AIMED AT LEAST IN GENERAL COMMITTEE THIS BILL DOES ENJOY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WHICH WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR. SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH RYAN FOR THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY THEY WERE GONNA MARC WITHOUT GROW WATER DISTRICT. BRIAN WE WILL COMMUNICATE MANY OR THREE MINUTES AND JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE THAT YOU HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THE BILL. THE. FLOOR IS YOURS THREE OF UP TO THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU TO- CREATES. WE BE RESPECTFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I THINK BETTER EGGMAN COVERED. A GREAT DEAL- THE POINTS THAT NEEDED TO BE MADE AND I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT ATTY- I THINK SHE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND BUT AGAIN- I DON'T THINK I SAID MY NAME YET SO FOR THE RECORD RYAN A JACKING WITH THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY. WHO IS R. W. A. R. D. THE JOINT POWERS THAT THE SCENE COMPRISED OF TWENTY DRINKING WATER AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE. WATER TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE AROUND PEOPLE IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA AND OUR MISSION IS TO. SERVE REPRESENT AND ALIGNING INTERESTS- ARE AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ADVANCE THE DELIVERY- WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AVAILABILITY QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY. AND THAT IS. WHY WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN THAT PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE WATER REALLY IS A CHALLENGE TO THAT MISSION. AND FRANKLY CENTER EGGMAN HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD- THE ISSUE IS THAT THE FINES ARE JUST NOT A SUFFICIENT DETERRENT. TO THE POINT WHERE I IT IS FRANKLY WE HAVE- SOME ACTORS OUT THERE. WHO JUST- CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO GO THREE LEAD TO. BECAUSE IT JUST BY. IS THE COST OF BUSINESS TO TAKE ON A FINE. AND POTENTIAL QUITE- THAT WATER SO AT RISK AND SO- I DO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THE TIME AND AN EFFORT THAT THEY PUT IN ON THE BILL AND I THINK THAT- AGAIN AS CENTER EGGMAN. STATED THAT THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE HAS BEEN STRUCK WITH LANGUAGE THAT FOR YOU AND SO I WILL THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME AND I WILL- YOU KNOW BACK IN THE ANY.

I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE ON. THREE NINETY FIVE. E. CIGARETTES CONTAIN A HARMFUL COMBINATION OF NICOTINE FLAVORING AND OTHER CHEMICALS ADDITIVES ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CURRENTLY TAXED AS OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS R. O. T. P.'S. THE TAX RATE IS MUCH LOWER THAN THAT OF TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS. AND UNDERMINING EFFORTS TO CURB VAPING. THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THESE PROJECTS. PRODUCTS BEIPING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR DESPITE THE HIGH A RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH INCOME. OUTCOMES THIS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC AMONG OUR YOUTH ACCORDING TO THE CDC'S NATIONAL YOUTH TOBACCO SURVEY NEARLY 20% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED CURRENT E. CIGARETTE USE. AND OF THOSE 40% REPORT HEAVY USE OF THE E. CIGARETTES. THE AVAILABILITY OF YOUTH APPEALING FLAVORS AND MARKETING HAS IN LARGE PART CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TREND. MANY TOBACCO RETAILERS ARE MORE PREVALENT IN THE POOREST AND MORE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK. OF AN ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND COVERAGE. SB THREE NINETY FIVE THE HEALTHY OPTIONS AND PREVENTION EDUCATION ACT PROPOSES CLOSER TAX PARITY BETWEEN THE SALE OF VAPING. PRODUCTS AND TRADITIONAL TOBACCO PRODUCTS BY PROPOSING A NEW TAX ON VAPE PRODUCTS. PROCEEDS OF THE RED THE NEW GENERATED GO TO A EXIST VOTER APPROVED SOURCES INCLUDING EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH.

IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ONE FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ONE IN TEN LOCAL IT AND RECORDING USING E. CIGARETTES THE PREVIOUS MONTH. REFLECTING THE INCREDIBLE UPTAKE IN AB HABITS. ADDITIONALLY 80% OF PARENTS WHO BATES DO SO AND HOMES AND CARS EXPOSING THOUSANDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN TO TOXINS SUCH AS HEAVY METAL. FILTER FINE PARTICULATE AND NICOTINE THERE SECONDHAND EXPOSURE. HOWEVER OUR STATE TECHNICIAN POLICY HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS AROUND BEEPING. IN FACT CHECKED RAISING RATES ON OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS WICH INCLUDE BAIT HAVE DECLINED BY SEVENTEEN. THIS MEANS THAT BABY PRODUCTS COST LESS. TODAY THAN THEY DID FOUR YEARS AGO MAKING THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SIMPLY PUT CALIFORNIANS REDUCTION IN TAXATION RATE DOES NOT MEET. THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS AROUND BAKING- THERE THAT THE BILL WOULD FUND AND- OF. PREVENTION PER THEY GET ABOUT OF TO BACK UP WITH. BY HELPING THE DETERMINES THE HEALTH.

FACING GERMAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO WELCOME US SENATOR SKINNER AT TO THE PODIUM THIS IS ON SENATE BILL THREE NINETY EIGHT THREE NINETY EIGHT IS FOCUS ON SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES RESULTING FROM VOTERS APPROVING PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR AND IT IS HARD TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BERKELEY AND REPRESENTING THE EAST BAY FOR THE AMENDMENTS TODAY THAT'S GOING TO REMOVE THE TAX COMPONENTS FROM THE BILL NOW IT'S GOING TO REMOVE TODAY BUT I WOULD CONSIDER THAT TEMPORARY BECAUSE- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK COLLABORATIVE LEE AS WE HAVE THE ENTIRE STEP OF THE WAY. WITH THE GOOD SENATOR ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD AT CENTER SKINNER AND I'VE DISCUSSED REFORMS TO THE CANNABIS TAX SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE ESPECIALLY FOR CULTIVATORS- AND IN FACT YESTERDAY AND I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO SENATE'S GONNA READER REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION WHERE THE- GOOD SENATORS STAFF TEAM IN THE STAFF TEAM FOR GOVERNANCE IN FINANCE I HAVE ALREADY SCHEDULED A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE TAX ISSUE NEXT WEEK ON REFORMS- IN AND THEREFORE THE ONLY AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. ARE THE TAX COMPONENTS OF THE BILL- DID THIS COMMITTEE RECEIVED THOSE THAT ARE IN LAST NIGHT THE REMAINDER OF THE BILLS IN FRONT OF US INCIDENTS CAN I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU WERE ONE OF THE MOST COLLABORATIVE HERE IN THE BUILDING I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING THE NEWS. HERE IN THE NEXT. COMING WEEKS. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR- X. WHAT WE ARE. ON AND AS YOU INDICATED I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MINUTES WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE INCREASED EXCISE TAX. WITH OF COURSE THE COMMITMENT THAT WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO ENSURE THAT LOCALS GET SOME SHARE OF THE REVENUE NOW ALL EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S- INFECTED THE COR THE BILL. SO AS WE ALL KNOW PROP SIXTY FOUR LEGALIZED ADULT USE OF CANNABIS. AND YOU KNOW MANY OF US IN OBVIOUSLY VOTERS WELCOME THAT. AND WHAT PART OF OUR PURPOSE. CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO HOPE THAT WE WOULD GET LOTS OF REVENUE FROM IT. AND WE OFTEN SEE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO DECRIMINALIZE. BUT WHAT UNFORTUNATELY IS A KURD IS THAT WE DO IN WHILE WE HAVE MANY. BUSINESSES THAT ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES. THAT GOT LICENSED. THAT ARE COMPLYING WITH EVERYTHING. WE STILL HAVE ABOUT A THIRD. OR RATHER THEIR ONLY A THIRD. OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE LEGAL BUSINESSES OPERATING. NOW AS WE KNOW HOW LONG WE HAD AN ILLEGAL BUSINESS. THE LEAGUE ILLEGAL BUSINESS IS THRIVING. ANSWER RIGHT NOW THAT ILLEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESS IS ESTIMATED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO HAVE A VALUE OF SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THE L. A- PUTS THE VALUE OF OUR LEGAL MARKET. ONLY AT THREE POINT THREE. SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL. THE GOOD BUSINESSES THAT HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. IT REALLY YOU START TO THINK WHY SHOULD I HAVE. AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO. HELLO WE WANT TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE THE LEGAL BUSINESS AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT LOCALITIES HAVE NOT EITHER ALLOWED. LEGAL BUSINESSES OR SO IS BECAUSE THE PROPOSITION SET UP A VERY COMPLICATED LOCAL LICENSING REGIME WHICH SOME LOCALITIES ARE JUST EITHER DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR. OR YOU KNOW WHAT WE FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY DID NOT WANT TO SET UP THAT. REGIME HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED TO HAVING A LEGAL BUSINESS OPERATE SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS CREATE THE ABILITY FOR THE LOCALITY TO OPT IN TO THE STATE SYSTEM SO THE STATE COULD GIVE THE LICENSE. NOW IF YOU THE LOCALITY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO WANT TO OPT IN IF YOU CAN'T GET ANY MONEY FROM THAT AND SO THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO FIX THE PART THAT MR REQUIRE THE CHAIR POINTED OUT AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO DO IT. BUT AS I BASICALLY INFORMED YOU OF WHAT THE ESSENTIALLY BILL DOES WHICH IS CREATE THIS ABILITY FOR THE LOCALITY TO OPT IN AND LET THE STATE. GIVE THE LICENSING BY TO THE LOCAL ENTITY TO OPERATE IN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IT ALSO CREATES AN EQUITY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IN OUR BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. AND LOWERS THE LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT THRESHOLD FROM TWENTY- EMPLOYEES TO CAN'T SO WITH THAT ALLOW ME WITNESSES TO SPEAK AND I HAVE AMY JENKINS FROM THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND ROBERT HARRIS FROM SEIU CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER SKINNER AGAIN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP LET'S GO TO OUR FIRST LEAD WITNESSES YOUR LEAD WITNESS YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES THIS IS GONNA BE ANNIE JENKINS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION MICHIGAN'S. WORK ON THE COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. YES THEY YOU CHAIR AND CAN MEMBER AMY JENKINS WITH PROFESSIONAL ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WHICH REPRESENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THE CANNABIS BY CHANGE WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT% LEGISLATION AND FOR YOUR WORK MISTER CHAIR CAN MAKE THAT SPELL- I BETTER BELL. AND IT SEEKS TO EXPANDCOMPUTER ACCESS TO LICENSED AND REGULATED CANNABIS GROW VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WHERE BY THE STATE WHAT IS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSING ON BEHALF OF PARTICIPATING JURISDICTIONS. CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY HAS FACED CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CANNABIS TOOK A FACT INCLUDING A LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL HEAVY REGULATORY BURDENS AND COMPETITION FROM A MUCH LARGER UNLICENSED MARKET. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES HOLD MASTER GROWTH POTENTIAL CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED INDUSTRY GENERATED MORE THAN FOUR POINT ONE BILLION AND TAXABLE SALES IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. A. 50% INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. DR ALSO TO A AND DOLLAR LIKE TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF TAX SHE ADMITS. THE LICENSE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT JOB GROWTH ADDING ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND WELL PAYING JOBS RESULTING IN MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND FULL TIME POSITION IN CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THE INDUSTRY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR DOLLARS AND ON CANNABIS AND CALIFORNIA ARE SPENT IN THE LEGAL MARKET THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO TWO FACTORS. FIRST IT TURNED B THE STATE HI CHRI RGULATORY BURDENS UNLIKE THE BUSINESSES SELL CHEAPER UNTESTED PRODUCTS TO PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS AND SECOND AS PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT ONLY 32% OF CALIFORNIA FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY CITIES IN CHINESE. AUTHORIZED LEGAL RETAIL CANNABIS BUSINESSES LEADING MANY PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL PRODUCTS. JUST IMAGINE THE POTENTIAL IF MORE COMMUNITIES AUTHORIZED LICENSED CANNABIS RETAIL SB THREE NINE EIGHT OFFERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STREAMLINED APPROACH TO PROVIDE SAFE ANDRESPONSIBLE ACCESS TO REGULATED CANNABIS. EXPANDING LEGAL ACCESS THIS BILL WILL HELP CURB DEMAND FOR UNLICENSED PRODUCT AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE INCREASING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES. HE SAID WE ALSO WISH TO APPLAUD THE SENATOR FOR INCLUDING PROVISIONS TO ESTABLISH A STAKEHOLDER OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO ENSURE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION EQUITY GRANTS. AND TO DEVELOP MODEL GUIDELINES FOR LOCAL EQUITY PROGRAMMING THIS IS A CRITICAL LONGSTANDING PRIORITY FOR CPA'S DIVERSITY INCLUSION AND SOCIAL EQUITY COMMITTEE.

MISTER CHAIR I SEAT NO ONE THANK YOU AT THE TIME FOR OPPOSITION I LOVE WORKING WITH HUMANA MODERATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH TO TURN IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TODAY TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR WELCOME MY MOTION NOW RIGHT AT CENTER DRIVES A POLICE INFORMER INSURANCE WELL I MOVED A MOTION BUT- I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS JUST. TELL YOU SOUND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF I MAY MISTER PLEASE I'M JUST. CURIOUS HERE- THE STATE IS CURRENTLY LICENSING- STRAIGHT. I MEAN. YOU CAN GET A LICENSE STRAIGHT FROM THE STATE. IS THAT IS THAT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THERE IS THE OPTIONS YES THERE IS THE ABILITY FOR- AS LONG AS THE LOCALITY DOES NOT OBJECT SO THERE IS ALREADY THAT ABILITY BUT OF COURSE IN THOSE CASES THE- LOCALITY GETS NO REVENUE. AND SO WE HAVE IN WE HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE ARE THERE ARE LOCALITIES WHO HAVE NOT SET UP. THEIR LICENSING STRUCTURE BECAUSE OF ITS COMPLICATION BUT WHO WANT TO HAVE LEGAL BUSINESSES AND OF COURSE WANT TO SHARE IN THE REVENUE SO THIS IS THIS BILL WOULD CREATE THAT ABILITY I JUST ONE MORE QUESTION IF I CAN- HOW WOULD. HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW IF THOSE LOCAL AREAS ARE REALLY GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS I MEAN IT IS THE JUST A GUESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM HAVE SAID SO OR DO WE REALLY HAVE SOME RELIABLE EXPECTATION- INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE OF COURSE MY STAFF AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THAT A LOT BECAUSE WHY WOULD WE WANT TO. GO TO THE- TROUBLE PUTTING SOMETHING COMPLICATED INTO PLACE IF IT DID NOT GET. UTILIZED NOW IF THE LOWER. CAN RECOVER NO. IT IS LIKELY IT WON'T YOU- SO THAT'S WHY .COM SO IMPORTANT AND WE'RE ON IT- HOWEVER I CAN. RIGHT NOW. WE WITH THIS PANDA INDUCED RECESSION. AND KNOWING THAT AT LEAST BRICK AND MORTAR THERE SOME LEVEL OF BRICK OR MORTAR TYPE OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO COME BACK AND WHILE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO COLLECT SALES TAX FROM INTERNET SALES. IT'S NOW IF FOR EXAMPLE OF THE AMAZON WAREHOUSES YOU KNOW SHOW MORE FAR AWAY THAN THAT LOCAL JURISDICTION DOESN'T GET EVEN IF YOU YOUR YOU BUY THE PRODUCT OR WHATEVER SO POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REVENUES HAVE REALLY BEEN HURT. AND SO THEY MADE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEYSEE THE VALUE OF. THAT WILL THAT THREE DOLLARS OUT OF EVERY FOUR DOLLARS SPENT ON CANNABIS IN THE STATE IS BEING SPENT ILLEGALLY AND THAT IF THEY CREATED THE PATHWAY FOR THE LEGAL THEY COULD BE COLLECTING REVENUE WHICHWOULD HELP THEM SO THAT I THINK PERHAPS A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE MAY NOT HAVE FOUND QUITE AS MUCH BUT I THINK NOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REALLY GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR REVENUE. SINCE THIS PANDEMIC. THE QUESTION I THINK IS HER SANDRA SO IT WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. BY SENATOR RUSSELL SHARING. NO QUESTIONS. WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER TO THE SKINNER FOR THE CLOSE. THANKS SO MUCH CARE- I WAS JUST REFLECTING. SPECIALLY ON HEARING NO OPPOSITION. AT LEAST FOR CALLERS- THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT. WHILE I HAVE NOT. SPENT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE PRIMARILY WORKING ON. THE ACCEPTANCE AND LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS. I CERTAINLY HAVE. BEEN INVOLVED IN IT FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. AND I WAS REFLECTING ON THE FACT THAT I COORDINATED. THE VERY FIRST. COURT UPHELD LEGAL. DECRIMINALIZATION OF CANNABIS INITIATIVE. BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IN BERKELEY. AND NOW TODAY WE HAVE. IT LEGAL ACROSS THE STATE. AND YET IRONICALLY WE ARE FACING THIS CIRCUMSTANCE. OF ES- THE GOOD WITNESS AMY JENKINS POINTED OUT. ONLY ONE DOLLARS OUT F EVERY FOUR DOLLARS SPENT BEING SPENT WITHIN THE LEGAL MARKET SO I AM THAT MUCH MORE COMMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO INCREASING THAT LEGAL MARKET AND SUPPORTING THAT LAURIE LEGAL MARKET AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB THREE NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE SKINNER WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MR NOW THE BEARD A LAY OUT THE MOTION AS WELL AS CALL THE ROLL.

ALRIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO SENATOR ALAN WE'RE GRATEFUL LOOK SENATE ALLEN HAS A COMPLICATED BILL IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL AND HE'S BEEN WORKING HARD TO BE ABLE TO LAND IT AND WE JUST WANT TO SAY. THANK YOU TO CENTER ALLEN FOR ALL HIS WORK ON THIS. AT THIS IS SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY THREE. MR ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE SIR. WHAT DID YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WIND UP WITH THE THANK YOU ARE HARD WORKING SENATE STAFF WHO. HAVE TO WIPE DOWN EVERY SURFACE AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO. DO OUR PART IN STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THIS TERRIBLE VIRUS SO THANK YOU. AS ALWAYS LET ME JUST START BY THINKING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THINK THE EXCELLENT- AND STAFF. FOR ITS HARD WORK I AM VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT YOUR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- THERE IN COMMON SIX MEMBERS FOR YOU TO. REFER TO. NON URINALYSIS THEY BASICALLY RE ESTABLISHED AT THE REQUEST OF THE REALTORS PROVISIONS- RELATED TO NIFTY TO DISTRICT PLAN ADOPTION AMENDMENT AND REVIEW. YOU'VE GOT MY COMMITMENT THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND ALSO WITH STAKEHOLDERS IF THE BILL. DOES MOVE FORWARD TODAY. THIS BILL SB FIVE SIXTY THREE UPDATES AND IMPROVES UPON THE SECOND NEIGHBORHOOD INFILL FINANCE AND TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS ACT. NIFTY TWO. NIGHTS A VOLUNTARY TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOL TO CATALYZE AFFORDABLE INFILL HOUSING. NEAR TRANSIT NOW AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS IN THE WAKE OF REDEVELOPMENT'S DISSOLUTION. THE LEGISLATORS CREATED NUMEROUS INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE YET TO CATALYZE SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH. A NIFTY TWO WAS ESTABLISHED IN CONSULTATION WITH HOUSING AND TRANSIT ADVOCATES TO PROVIDE CITIES AND COUNTIES. WITH A FINANCING TOOL. THAT THE- THAT ESPECIALLY INCENTIVIZE IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING IN TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES. TO THE LEGISLATION THAT I AUTHORED CREATING THE STATUTE ALSO REQUIRED THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH OPR. TO STUDY AND REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TANK TAX INCREMENT OF TOOLS FOR INCREASING HOUSING PRODUCTION. SO HERE'S THE THING OPR TRIP. WHICH WAS RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR NOTES THAT LIMITED REVENUE POTENTIAL OF INCREMENT FINANCING TOOLS. QUOTE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO ASSIST IN MEETING STATE HOUSING GOALS AND IT RECOMMENDS EXPLORATION OF WAYS TO OP POTENTIALLY LEVERAGE EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING SOURCES. TO ENABLE USE OF FINANCING TO PROMOTE LOCATION EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN PLACES WHERE CURRENT INCREMENTS FINANCING TOOLS ALONE. MAY BE INSUFFICIENT. SO THIS BILL INCORPORATES- PR'S RECOMMENDATION. I ENVISIONING A ROLE FOR POTENTIAL STATE FUNDING TO BOLSTER A SHARED GOAL WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES OF BUILDING INFILL HOUSING AND COMPLEMENTARY INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSIT. IT ALSO STRENGTHENS NIFTY TO USE TENANT PROTECTIONS. HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION IN INTO DISPLACEMENT PROVISIONS ENSURING DISTRICTS AUGMENT BUT NOT UNINTENTIONALLY UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. SO BY ESTABLISHING A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR COLLABORATION AND CO INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE STATE AND ITS CITIES AND COUNTIES. WHO WISH TO WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THIS BILL PROVIDES A MECHANISM THE COMMERCIAL MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT ANYONE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. CAN PROVIDE ALONE SO ON THE PHONE WITH ME TODAY AND SAID THAT DESPITE SUPPORT ANYTHING ON BEHALF OF MOVE LA AND SANTA MONICA TO RENTERS RIGHTS. THE CO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION.

SUPPORT INVESTMENT FROM ALL THREE PRIMARY LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. TO MEET THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND HOMELESS PREVENTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL CREATES A FRAMEWORK BUILDING OFF.

IF SUCH AN AGREEMENT IS MADE THEN PROVIDES AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHALL PROVIDE- UP TO HALF THE PHONES. THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY COMBINED BEFORE WILL HAVE THE COMMITMENT. IS BUT ONLY IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE AND WITHIN THE LIMITS. OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED WE ENVISION. AND SUGGESTED THE BILL THAT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL- AND HOMELESS COORDINATING THE FINANCING COUNCIL. DEVELOPING GUIDELINES TO- FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH AN EFFORT- THIS FOLLOWS NIFTY TUNES COMMITMENT TO. INVESTORS IN YOUR TRANSIT WHICH WE KNOW HAS BEEN IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IMPORTANT- OBJECTIVE OF THE STATE. TO HELP REDUCE THEIR BY. THE EMPTY.

FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATORS IN A ROW. FOR HER WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- MADAM SENATOR YOU DO A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WE WELCOME YOU TO GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY IMPRISONING SP SIX FIFTY EIGHT WHICH IS BEING SPONSORED BY SENATE SAMBAR DINO COUNTY ASSESSOR RECORDER CLERK MR BOB DENTON FORMER SENATOR. THIS MEASURE AUTHORIZES COUNTY ASSESSOR'S TO OFFER A PARTIAL PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR DISABLED VETERANS A PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OF DISABILITY RATING PROVIDED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS. FOR THE MILITARY SERVICE IN WHICH THE VETERAN HAS BEEN DISCHARGED OTHER STATES OFFER PROPERTY TAX CREDITS ON VARYING DEGREES AND- MANY ALLOW VETERANS TO QUALIFY WITH DISABILITY RATINGS LESS THAN ILLINOIS IN TEXAS. CURRENTLY DISABLED VETERANS MAY REQUEST REDUCTION ON THEIR PROPERTIES- HOME SS VALUE FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY ARE 1100% DISABLED BLIND IN BOTH EYES OR HAVE LOST. ONE OR MORE LIMBS. IF DISEASE THE BETTER TO SURVIVE SPOUSE ALSO QUALIFY. HOWEVER WITH THIS WITHOUT THIS BILL A VETERAN WITH A LIFE CHANGING 50% DISABLED RATING WOULD BE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE AN ELIGIBLE FOR PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTIONS. ACCORDING TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DATA PROVIDED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS THERE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND VETERANS WHO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF DISABILITY RATING. M. AND IF THEY OWN PROPERTY WOULDN'T NOT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN LOS ANGELES ALONE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND VETERANS HE WOULD BE INELIGIBLE UNDER THIS CURRENT LAW. AT A TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE VA ESTIMATED THAT IN CALIFORNIA THERE'D BE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND HOMELESS VETERANS. WHICH WAS FIVE TIMES MORE THAN THE NEXT HIGHEST STATE SB FIVE SIX FIFTY EIGHT COULD- COULD BE THAT SAVING GRACE FOR A VETERAN HELPING THEM TO KEEP THEIR HOME TO GET THEM THROUGH THE HARDSHIP UNTIL THEY CAN GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. WE ALL KNOW AND ARE AWARE THE SACRIFICES THAT OUR VETERANS MAKE WHEN THEY SWEAR TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY- WHAT WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER IS THAT VETERANS STRUGGLE TO ADJUST BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE AS WELL. THIS TRANSACTION THIS TRANSITION CAN EVEN BE MORE DIFFICULT- FOR THOSE INJURED WHILE SERVING IN WORST AND THAT STRUGGLE WITH ILLNESSES- ILLNESSES SUCH AS PTSD. THOUGH THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL BENEFIT THEY CAN EQUAL THE AMOUNT OF LOSS FOR THE DISABLED VETERANS AND WHAT THEY FACE. SB SIX FIFTY EIGHT CAN PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF FOR STRUGGLING VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. FORMER STATE SENATOR BOB DENTON HE WAS THE ASSESSOR WHO IS THE ASSESSOR RECORDER. FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY IS MY PER SPONSOR AND THE PRIMARY WITNESS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HE'LL BE TESTIFYING DEVELOPMENTS ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GROVE WE ARE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE TODAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO FORMER. SENATOR AND CURRENT ASSESSOR CLERK RECORDER IN SAN BENITO COUNTY THAT'S MISTER BOB DUTTON AND OF COURSE WE ALWAYS HAVE A SECTION FOR MR DUTTON IS HE WAS ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE- SENATE REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE IS WELL- MISTER SENATOR. THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES AND WE'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOOD SENATOR SENATOR GROVE. WELL I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERING THE S. B. SIX FIFTY EIGHT- IS THE GOOD SENATOR GROW IS SUPPORTED OUT. I AM THE CUSTOMER DINO COUNTY ASSESSOR THAT'S LIFE AFTER BEING IN THE STATE SENATE- THE AND IT BRINGS ME GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY EIGHT- THIS ISSUE KIND OF CAME UP- I USED. TO DO A LOT OF RESOURCE FAIRS FOR VETERANS. WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED AS THE COUNTY ASSESSOR AND- ANSWER THIS QUESTION KEPT COMING UP I HAD PEOPLE THAT. WOULD HAVE LIKE 90% DISABILITY AND THERE WAS JUST NOTHING I COULD DO FOR ME I HAD TO TELL NO. AND THAT WAS REALLY DISHEARTENING. TO LOOK AT SOMEBODY WHO'S WHO SERVED HIS COUNTRY FAITHFULLY WHO NOW. IN TODAY'S MILITARY HIS YOU KNOW THE NATIONAL GUARD PLEASE MORE CRITICAL ROLE THAN IT DID BACK WHEN I WAS IN. THE SERVICE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. AND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ONLY. HELP US HERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT THEY ALSO. THEN WE'LL GET COULD SOMETIMES CALLED IN THE ACTIVE DUTY TO SERVE. OTHER MISSIONS- AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AS WELL- THE CURRENTLY THE DISABLED VETERANS EXEMPTION IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO SOMEBODY WHO'S TOTALLY DISABLED- THAT MEANS A 100% AND THAT'S DETERMINED BY THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND VETERANS RESIDING HERE IN. SAN BENITO COUNTY. WITH THE SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY RATING. AND OF THOSE ONLY ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND VETERANS- HAVE A. 100% DISABILITY RATING- THIS MEANS IS BET SIX. ONLY APPLIES TO ABOUT 16% OF THE DISABLED VETERANS HERE IN SAMBAR DINO COUNTY. AND EVEN IF A VETERAN HAS A DISABLE READING OF 90% CURRENT WHILE THE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW. THEM TO QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION. TOO OFTEN WERE FORCED TO TURN AWAY DISABLED VETERANS SEEKING. SOME TYPE OF HELP OR ASSISTANCE. I LIKE TO THINK- SENATOR GROW FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN ON THIS ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL WE PROVIDE SUPPORT RESOURCES TO OUR NATION'S. DISABLED VETERANS. THEY MAKE A GREAT SACRIFICE WAY SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND DESERVING OF THIS BENEFIT. ALSO I NOTICED IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT THERE WAS GOING TO BE- A POSSIBLE CONSIDERATION OF AN AMENDMENT TO ESTABLISH A- BOTTOM AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY REASONABLE I WOULD RECOMMEND. FIFTY PERCENT- IF THAT WOULD BE THE COMMITTEES DESIRE AND- AND I CERTAINLY THINK IT WOULD BE REASONABLE. WHAT YOU WANT THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE BOTH.

THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE HAVE A MOTION OR QUESTION MOTION- MEDICINE OR DRUGS OKAY WE OF COURSE WE HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE AT CENTER DRIVES OF THE FORESHORES YES- I WOULD BE PREPARED TO- MOVE. THE BILL BUT MY QUESTION IS AND IT WAS RAISED I THINK BY CENTER DUTTON IS THERE A BOTTOM THRESHOLD- THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED. THERE WAS NOT A THRESHOLD OR FLOOR THRESHOLD AND THAT I'D BE WILLING TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT. ON THE FLOOR THRESHOLD IF- THE WAY I ENVISION THE IN THE WAY IT'S- THE WAY THE I ENVISION THE BILL IS THAT RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA VETERANS ARE REQUIRED TO BE 1100% DISABLED. A BLIND IN BOTH EYES OR YOU LOSE ONE OR MORE LAMBS WONDERED. ALOUD TO SEE ME TWO OR MORE LINES. WHAT ABOUT A DISABLED VETERAN WHO HAS HIS ARM CUT OFF AND BECAUSE OF THAT TRAGIC EVENT HE HAS PTSD AND CAN'T FUNCTION IN SOCIETY.

FOCUSING ON SURPLUS LAND AND A FORMER MILITARY BASES WE WELCOME. THE GOOD SENATOR- COMMITTEE. WE'RE GOING TO DISINFECT THE PODIUM AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR MEN. TO BE TO PRESENT SB. SEVEN NINETEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND SEVEN NINETEEN MISTER CHAIR EXCELLENT JOB AND STAYING IN OF MOVING INTO COMMITTEE ALONG. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB SEVEN NINETEEN TODAY. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THEIR DILIGENT AND THOUGHTFUL WORK ON THIS BILL AND I DO WANT TO SAY THE OUTSET WE ARE ACCEPTING TAKE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. SB SEVEN NINETEEN WOULD PROVIDE THE TUSTIN LEGACY PROJECT WITH LIMITED FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE REVISED SURPLUS LAND ACT. WHILE SETTING AGGRESSIVE A FORMAL HOUSING TARGETS NOW FOR BACKGROUND TESTING LEGACY IS A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT ON THE SITE OF A FORMER MARINE CORPS AIR STATION IN THE HEART OF TUSTIN. THE CITY HAS BEEN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TUSTIN LEGACY FOR WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS. THIS LAND WAS CONVERTED TO CIVILIAN USE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. ANY TUSTIN LEGACY REDUCE PLAN AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WERE PREPARED. BY CONTAINS THE PROPERTY WAS APPROVED ON THAT BASIS BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. AND THE CITY OF TUSTIN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. SINCE THAT TIME OF THE LAND TRANSFER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE CITY OF TUSTIN. EXTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT HAS OCCURRED AS PRESCRIBED IN THE REUSE PLAN. FORMAL FOREIGN MILITARY BASES HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO A VARIETY. OF RESIDENTIAL EDUCATIONAL OPEN SPACE AND COMMERCIAL USES- SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AND THAT'S NO ECEPTION IN TUSTIN TODAY. WHERE THEY DEVELOPED ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OF THE SITE SO FAR. I INCLUDING THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN UNITS OF HOUSING- NEARLY MODERATE OR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND FOUR HUNDRED HOMELESS SHELTER BEDS. NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE REVISED SURPLUS LANDS ACT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CITY- DOES NOT RECOGNIZED FEDERALLY APPROVED REUSE PLANS FOR FORMER MILITARY BASES. OR AGGREGATE ENTITLEMENTS FOR LARGE AREAS LIKE TUSTIN LEGACY OF SURPLUS LAND ACT ON THE OTHER HAND DOES AFFECT THE CITY'S GOALS AND ABILITY TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE. CREATE DIVERSE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES CREATE JOBS IN YOUR HOUSING AND PROVIDE PUBLIC BENEFIT SHARED BY THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AT TUSTIN LEGACY. THE CITY HAS DONE ITS BEST BUT NEEDS FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE REVISED SLA TO ACHIEVE THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED GOALS. AND ALSO TO ME IT'S FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS FOR REDEVELOPING THE FORMER BASE AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CITY MAY HAVE A STRONG LEGAL ARGUMENT. FOR DEVELOPING A BASE NOTWITHSTANDING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE REVISED SLA GIVEN ITS PRIOR AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- BUT HE HAS BEEN WORKING IN GOOD FAITH TO DO ITS BEST TO TRY TO MEET THE GOALS SET OUT IN THE S. REVISED SLA. NOT MY BILL SPECIFICALLY WOULD REQUIRE NEW RESIDENTIAL UNITS BUILT ON THE TUSTIN LEGACY SITE. TO MEET EITHER THE FOLLOWING AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE AGGREGATE. EITHER 20% OF THE RESIDENTIAL UNITS WILL BE ISSUED RESTRICTED TO PERSONS AND FAMILIES OF LOW OR MODERATE INCOME. FOR AT LEAST 15% OF THE RESIDENTIAL UNITS. WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND 10% OF THOSE UNITS AVAILABLE 10% YOU KNOW UNITS AVAILABLE TO VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. I AM TOLD THAT THE CITY OF TUSTIN THAT THEY'RE WORKING THEIR BEST TO TRY TO ACTUALLY GET 15% LOW INCOME. IN THE AGGREGATE- BUT WE WANT IT WILL PLAY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS ON A PARCEL BY PARCEL BASIS AS REQUIRED BY THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT. THAT TUSTIN LEGACY IS ON THE LAST REMAINING OPPORTUNITIES ORANGE COUNTY TO PROVIDE FOR DIVERSE MIX OF HOUSING JOBS EDUCATIONAL OPEN SPACE UNITS SB SEVEN NINETEEN PROVIDES NEEDED FLEXIBILITY FOR THEM TO MOVE FORWARD- AND THIS BILL WILL FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS. AND HUNDREDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN TUSTIN WHICH OTHERWISE WILL NOT BE BILLED BY EXPEDITING. HOUSING COULD A PRODUCTION BRINGING JOB INCREASING AT. TO SPACE. AND BUILDING NECESSARY IN.

AND THE NIMITZ DID SLIGHTLY INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE MET- SO- LONG STORY SHORT IT'S COMPLICATED BUT IT DID SLIGHTLY INCREASE COMING INTO COMMITTEE WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SENATOR MAN IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IS HE- WOULD MOVE THE BILL FORWARD.

BY CONCERNS BY- YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS AUTHORED BILLS THAT HAVE HAD AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND I KNOW THAT IT IS- IT IS. COMPLICATED AND A LOT OF WAYS BECAUSE WE ALL WANT TO HAVE THE MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPOSSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE. THAT THE PROJECT IS STILL GOING TO PENCIL OUT BECAUSE OF PARTISAN PENCIL. THEN WE GET NO MARKER RAY OR NO I KNOW AFFORDABLE. AND AND I ALSO KNOW THAT ON SOME OF THESE VERY COMPLICATED SURPLUS LAND PROJECTS A LOT OF SOME OF THEM ARE NOT UNIQUE BUT THERE ARE SOME LIKE THIS ONE APPEARS TO BE THAT ARE. THAT CAN BE ARE QUITE UNIQUE AND COMPLICATED IN THEIR OWN WAYS AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT SHOULD HAVE FRANKLY HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO AND HAS BEEN DELAYED AND- HAS A REAL POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE A LOT OF. HOUSINGS EVEN THOUGH I. UNDER RISK BECAUSE OF THE- OF THE THERE. LIVES PERCOLATORS. BY FOR THEM SOME OF THE SERVERS ALIGNED WITH COMMON IN MANY WAYS- I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION HERE.

UP PERCENTAGE FOR MODERATE INCOME HIGHER PERCENTAGE BUT IT WOULDN'T INCLUDE MODERATE- AND I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS SAID BUT IN A- THIS IS THIS WAS- PUBLIC LAND. I THINK THAT'S THE CONSIDERATION WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM YOU KNOW AN ENTIRELY PRIVATE SECTOR- SITUATION WHERE WE NEED. ON ONE WEEK I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE PENCILING OUT- IS MUCH HARDER. BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S PUBLIC LAND- SO. I GUESS I WOULD SUPPORT IT BUT I WOULD REALLY. BURJEEL AND NEED YOU TO CONTINUE TO PUSH IN THE DIRECTION OF A HIGHER PERCENTAGE. ESPECIALLY FOR LOWER OR VERY LOW OR AT LEAST YOU KNOW THAT THE TWENTY PERCENT- THAT SAYS FOR LOW OR MODERATE MEANS THAT THE ENTIRE RIGHT AND I AND THAT'S I THINK THE PART THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THAT THAT'S WHERE WE COULD END UP SO I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH EVERYTHING THAT- YOUR- SUPPORTERS ARE EXPERT WITNESSES SAID- BUT THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE HERE WITH ME AND I. I REALLY BROUGH JUDE TO ADDRESS THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY THANK YOU SENAOR OTHERS THOUGH I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND- TEN SENATOR WIENER'S POINT WE ARE WORKING CONSTANTLY WITH THE STOCK WITH THE CITY TESTING TO TRY TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT PARCELS TO BE DEVELOPED AND IT'S JUST ABOUT FINDING FINANCING- BUT I THINK- I DON'T PUT WORDS IN MAYOR CLARK'S MOUTH BUT BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE PREPARED TODAY. TO COMMIT 215% AGGREGATE LOW VERY LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW SO BUILT- GOING FORWARD WOULD BE IN THAT CATEGORY- AND SO IT WOULD NOT BE AS YOU RAISE THE CONCERN LIKE 20% JUST ALL IN THAT MODERATE RANGE 15% AT LEAST WOULD BE LOW VERY LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW IS THAT CORRECT.

THERE ARE SEVERAL AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON SENATE BILL FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT- THAT WILL EXEMPT STATE AND LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICTS REMOVED- IT SINGLE FAMILY ZONES BY SPECIFYING THE BILL MUST BE ZONED FOR MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT STARTS NOW. AT THREE UNITS INSTEAD OF TO ENSURE THAT IT APPLIES TO MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS- WE ARE LIMITING AT THE BILL THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY WITH THE CENTER WIENER WE ARE ABLE TO COME TO CONCLUSION ON THAT FOCUSING ON URBANIZED AREAS IN URBAN CLUSTERS VERSUS. RURAL AND OF COURSE REMOVING A LOT SIZE PROVISIONS- IS WELL AGAIN THIS IS ALL BEEN IN COLLABORATION WITH SENATOR WIENER AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR WIENER WE HAVE WORKED ON SEVERAL BILLS TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS- AAN DE HE'S ONE OF THE BEST- ON BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SIR- AND WANTED TO BE ABLE TO. SAY TO THE COMMITTEE YOU NOW HAVE AN IMMENSE IN FRONT OF YOU HONESTLY FOR SEVENTY EIGHT I JUST WANT TO READ THEM ALOUD IS WELL IN AND TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR WIENER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A STATEMENT AND THEN-OBVIOUSLY I'D SAY ANYTHING IN REGARD TO WHAT I JUST SAID. IN THAT COLLABORATION THAT WE'VE HAD COMING INTO COMMITTEE TODAY CENTER WHERE THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON SB FOUR SEVENTY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU SAID WERE ALSO THE F. A. R. WILL BE ONE POINT OH FOR THREE TO SEVEN UNITS AND ONE POINT TWO FIVE THREE TO TEN- AND- THE LOT SIZE PROVISIONS. WILL BE AS LONG AS THEY'RE IN THE BILL NOW WILL BE REMOVED ON THERE WILL BE A NEW REQUIREMENT. PROHIBITING LOCAL AGENCIES FROM THE NINE YOUR PRODUCT. SOLD BECAUSE EXIST LAW. HAS A NON CONFORMING SIZE. AND THERE ARE ALSO SOME- TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. RELATING A LOT COVERAGE. SO THEY ARE ON THE DOCUMENT YOU JUST HANDED OUT- AND- MISTER JOHN. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK- YOU IN YOURSELF FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE'RE HAPPY TO. ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES. AMENDMENTS TO SENATE BEFORE SEVENTY EIGHT. IT IS A VERY SOLID AMENDMENTS AND IT'S- A ROBUST BILL IN A TINY TIGHTENED UP AND SO WE REALLY. PLEASE SHARE YOUR WORK WITH US TO MAKE IT A STRONGER AND BETTER BILL- SO COLLEAGUES SB FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT IS ONE OF THOSE VERY- TECHNICAL AND WONKY BILLS SITES ALSO- IMPACTFUL- IT HAS TO DO WITH FLOOR AREA RATIO WHICH IS ABOUT. A SQUARE FOOTAGE COPS- THAT ARE PLACED ON BY CITIES FROM TIME TO TIME- AND ALSO PARCEL SIZES. AND REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT- IS FUNDAMENTALLY MAKING SURE THAT WHEN A CITY IS SUPPLIES TO SMALL MULTI UNIT BETWEEN THREE AND TEN YEAR NOTES. MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THE CITY HAS LOCALLY ZONES. FOR THREE TO TEN UNITS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF CITY HAS MADE A DECISION THAT A LOT IS ZONED FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND TEN UNITS. THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BUILD. THOSE THREE TO TEN UNITS- AND THAT- AND THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE REQUIREMENTS I DO NOT. TAKE WITH ONE HAND WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN WHAT THE OTHER THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT SUSAN SHARING THAT WHEN THE CITY HS ZONES. FOR THREE TO TEN UNITS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUILD THREE TO TEN UNITS- THERE ARE SOME VERY RESTRICTIVE SQUARE FOOTAGE CALLED FLOOR AREA RATIO F. A. R. REQUIREMENTS. THAT ARE SO RESTRICTIVE BETTER CITY SAY ZONES A LOT FOR SIX UNITS IN THEIR GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING. BUT IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD. ANYWHERE CLOSE TO SIX UNITS BECAUSE OF THOSE OTHER. REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL DOES NOT WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS BILL DOES NOT. LOCAL ZONING WHATEVER THE CITY HAS OWNED FOR THREE FOUR FIVE SEVEN UNITS TEN UNITS. THAT WILL APPLY WE DON'T CHANGE IT ANYWAY IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE APPROVAL PROCESS. IN ANY WAY IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE HEIGHT LIMITS OR THE SETBACKS IT IS NOT CHANGED DESIGN STANDARDS- IT IS LIMITED TO JUST MAKING SURE. THAT PEOPLE CAN BUILD WHAT A CITY HAS LOCAL HE SAID YOU CAN BUILD IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER. OF UNITS. AND SO- THAT THAT'S THE BILL- INSURER IT DOES NOT AFFECT SINGLE FAMILY ZONES IN ANYWAY IT TARTS. WHERE THIS IT'S IT STARTS IN AREAS WHERE THE CITY HAS OWN FOR THREE UNITS ARE MORE. SO SINGLE FAMILY ZONES ARE NOT IMPACTED IN ADDITION RURAL AGRICULTURAL AREAS. ARE NOT IMPACTED IN ANY WAY THIS IS ABOUT URBANIZED. AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN ZONED ALREADY LOCALLY OFFER MULTI. UNIT SO COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR TIME. WE SHOULD THE COMMITTEES WERE WITH US AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY HOUSE FOR AN IPO- WITH ME TODAY ARE REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUR TO.

SEVENTY EIGHT- WILL HOPEFULLY REFORM. OPTIMISING MIDDLE. I WOULD OFTEN THAT IS NOT PROPERLY ENOUGH TO HOW. A BIG. LAW DISPATCH IMPORT TO MAKE THAT WE ARE GETTING.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS- DR HOLLY OSBORNE A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER UNITED NEIGHBORS. AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS BILL BECAUSE UP UNTIL OF. THANK YOU HOURS AGO IT WAS STILL BLANK ON A TWO MOST IMPORTANT PARAMETERS AND YOU CAN JUST FILL THE MAN OVER THERE SAID YOU FEEL THE MAN BUT I DON'T KNOW WHATTHEY ARE AND I WANTED TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND THE FACT THAT IT WASN'T EVEN. READY IT IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND OF ALL THESE PEOPLE CAN SO ARDENTLY SUPPORTED WHEN THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT AND I DO NOT THINK THE BILL WAS READY TO BE PRESENTED TODAY. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR PHONE CALL WE'LL TALK AGAIN ABOUT THAT IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PHONE CALL WE APPRECIATE YOU CALLING IN LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALLER MATT A MODERATOR. THANK YOU WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND A MODERATOR AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE CONCERN THAT WAS JUST EXPRESSED- AND- LOOK. HERE'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN IN. DISCUSSIONS IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS FOR THE LAST. COUPLE WEEKS NOW AND OUT WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL- AND- IT IS INCREDIBLY COMMON. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE BILLS- THAT ERROR OF BEING AMENDED. COMING INTO COMMITTEE- AND WE PRESENTED TO EACH OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH AN AMENDMENT SHEET THAT IS. CURRENTLY IN FRONT OF US. HIGHLIGHTING EACH OF THE AMENDMENTS. HERE YEAH AND IT'S PRESENTED WITH THE SENATOR. SO LET'S TURN IT OVER TO THE MAJORITY LEADER MR MAJORITY LEADER DID YOU WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS. ON SB FOUR SEVENTY PLEASE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I WAS A HARD NO ON THIS BILL AND THIS WAS JUST EXPRESSED. BECAUSE OF THESE AMENDMENTS WHICH I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON. IF I COULD JUST TAKE A MOMENT SIR BUT WITH RESPECT TO THAT AND I YOU CAN EXPRESSED IT BUT I WANT TO. PERSONALLY MASS THOSE QUESTIONS IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU THANK YOU SIR FIRST. THIS MEASURE DOES NOT APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY- REPRESENTING CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT SECOND TO DOES NOT APPLY TO DO SUPER DUPLEX OWNING IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THIRDLY IT INCLUDES THE HISTORIC. WHAT OVERLAYS OWNS INTERESTS IN IN EXEMPTS THOSE ARE CORRECT THAT'S ORRECT OKAY AND- SO IT REALLY IS A- THIS NOTION AS YOU EXPLAIN TRUTH IN ZONING SO THAT HARMONIZES. THE ZONING OF AREAS THAT THAT ARE MULTI FAMILY HAVE THREE TO TEN BUT THAT THE FAA ARE THE- FLOOR AREA- REQUIREMENTS WOULD IT YOU KNOW THE IT TO HARMONIZE IS THAT IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND YOU HAVE AN OPINION OR ANY THE EXPERTS YOU CONSULTED WITH HAVE AN OPINION. IS WHAT IMPACT THEY THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE OBJECTIVE HERE. IS TO INCREASE HOUSING RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS THERE ANY SENSE THAT YOU HAVE FROM ALL THE HOMEWORK THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS AND THE HOUSING SPACE. AS TO JUSTIN. MY DAD USED TO SAY EYEBROW TEST WHAT DO YOU THINK IMPACT THIS MIGHT HAVE I MEAN I THINK IT WHAT IT WILL DO. SO IF YOU LOOK THE TURNER CENTER HAS ACTUALLY DONE SOME REALLY GOOD WORK. ON COMPILING F. A. R. REQUIREMENTS AROUND THE STATE THERE CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A FOR YOUR REQUIREMENTS AT ALL THERE CITIES THAT HAVE- YOU KNOW. I FOR YOUR REQUIREMENTS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND INNER CITIES THAT HAVE LOWER F. A. OURS THE WHAT IT'LL DO IS IT'LL SO WE REQUIRE CITIES TO DO HOUSING ELEMENTS. THAT SAY WHERE THE MULTI UNIT IS WHAT'S GOING TO GET BILL WHERE WHAT IT WILL DO IS I MEAN THAT THAT HOUSING ELEMENT WILL HAVE MEANING. THAT WHEN THEY SAY THAT THE ZONE FOR ACCIDENT REALLY MEANS I ALSO WILL HAVE A REAL IMPACT THIS ISN'T LIKE A TIDAL WAVE BUILDS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. BUT IT WILL. ENABLE A NUMBER OF THESE SMALLER PROJECTS TO ACTUALLY GET THOUGH THIS IS JUST ONE. ELEMENT RIGHT THERE ARE OTHER THANK YOU KNOW ISSUES THAT THE BILL DOESN'T DEAL WITH BUT IT'S ONE AREA THAT WILL MAKE THESE ZONES PLANS. HOUSING PLANS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL BUT MR CUSTOMER QUICK QUESTION. LIESER FLOOR ERROR RATIO. WE DO. THE FOR THREE SO UNITS TO ONE OCHRE CORRECT. AND THE FLOOR AREA RATIOS REDUCED ONE POINT TWO FIVE H. TEN USE THAT CORRECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THANK YOU MR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SURGERY LEADER APPRECIATE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS PLEASE CENTER PROJECT BUT BEFORE YOU DECIDE LIKE MR ON A FIVE. WHAT IF I WANT AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU. LOOK I JUST SOUNDS GOOD TO ME I JUST IF I COULD IS ADAM RESPECT I'M TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. TO KEEP THIS MOVING BUT I JUST WANT TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REVIEW THE DETAILS AS THIS. CAME IN THE LAST MINUTE AND WE'RE TRYING TO GO THROUGH IT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T WE THINK IT DOES SO I WILL. ACCOMMODATE THE- AUTHOR TODAY BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT IS IT REALLY GETS TO THE FLOOR. TO CHANGE MY OPINION. DEPENDING UPON THE DETAILS AS I. REVIEW THE STUFF I THINK IT'LL BE OKAY BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I GOT IT RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SANTA ROSA. THANK YU- FIRST I DO WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE AUTHOR. OF FOR CONTINUING TO MEET AND TO ADDRESS THESE. THESE ISSUES I KNOW THIS IS A- AN AREA OF EXPERTISE FOR YOU- SO I- I STILL HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING CONCERNS YOU AND I WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME- INDIVIDUALLY- BUT I WANT TO LAY OUT HERE- FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM. A AND MY DISTRICT IN IN LOS ANGELES WHICH IS NORTHEAST LA EAST LA BOYLE HEIGHTS- MY DISTRICT 77% OF THE RESIDENTS RENT. THAT'S MORE THAN ANY OTHER ARM DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 77% MY CONCERN IS- AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS THIS IS ONLY MAKE CHANGES LIKE THIS. IN MY DISTRICT WHERE THERE'S OVERCROWDED- IT'S OVERCROWDING NOT JUST FROM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT THERE'S IT'S ALSO OVERCROWDING INSIDE. THE DWELLINGS THE APARTMENTS- AND WHAT THIS PRESENTS IS AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR FOLKS TO COME ALONG. BY DEMOLISH DISPLAYS- BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE A HUGE PROFIT FROM IT AND SO THIS IS THE CONCERN THAT I CARRY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY- AND IBM I'M GRATEFUL THAT THE AUTHORS SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THIS- I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC. LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THAT- BUT I'M SURE WE COULD COME UP WITH IT SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT TODAY- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU. CHAU ALWAYS SHOW THE WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND TALK- BUT- I TO I'M LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION FOR THAT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS EVERY TIME A HOUSING BILL COMES UP- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. JUST AS YOU BIG THEN EXEMPTED DUPLEXES EXEMPTED A LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICTS IT'S LIMITED TO URBANIZED AND URBAN CLUSTERS NO RURAL I MEAN THERE'S ALL THESE. EXEMPTIONS AND IT GETS TIGHTER AND TIGHTER INTO CERTAIN AREAS SO. THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AND I'M I'M GLAD WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TALK THANK YOU- FROM AMATEUR RESPOND THANK YOU CENTER THERE ARE SERVER THAT OF COURSE WE I LOOK FORWARD TO CHATTING A COUPLE OF THINGS WHEN WE SAY THE URBANIZED AREAS URBAN CLUSTERS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE DISTRICT OF MY DISTRICT ARE OBVIOUSLY. VERY URBAN IT'S WELL BEYOND THAT I MEAN IT'S A IT'S SUBURBAN AREA IT'S BIG SWATHS OF THE STATE WHICH DOES. NOT MAKE CLEAR THAT LIKE RURAL AGRICULTURAL AREAS OR NOT- INCLUDED- AND IN TERMS THIS PLACEMENT JUST TO BE CLEAR- THIS BILL THE AS USUAL A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- DISPLACEMENT APPEAR DISPLACEMENT. IT'S ABOUT ONE AREA IS BEING REZONED SO IT'S NOW IT'S OWN FOR TWO UNITS WERE GOING TO CHANGE THAT TO TWENTY UNITS WRITES OR CREATES INCENTIVES TO. REDEVELOP WAR WE STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL PROCESS SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH. SEQUEL ANYMORE BOB AND IN THE BILL THAT I'VE AUTHORED THAT DO THAT THE CHANGES OWNING OR THAT EXPEDITE THE APPROVAL PROCESS I ALWAYS INCLUDE ANTI DEMOLITION. PROTECTIONS IN THERE WE CAN ALWAYS HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE SCOPE OF THOSE SHOULD BE BUT TO ME THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I DON'T WANT BILLS THAT I AUTHOR. TO LEAD TO DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE AND KNOCKING DOWN OF SOUND HOUSING THE PEOPLE WERE LIVING IN OUR PEOPLE GET EVICTED AND THEN A YEAR LATER THEY- DEMOLISH IT. ON SOME VERY MINDFUL OF THAT- BUT THE EASIER THIS BILL- I GET IT ALL IT DOES IS SAYS IF THE ZONING IS ALREADY IN PLACE. BENTOS HONOR THAT'S OWNING AND IT DOESN'T IMPROVE PROJECT AT ALL SO- BUT WITH THAT SAID I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SITTING DOWN WITH YOU BECAUSE I THINK YOU AND I HAVE A SHARED GOAL. BUT SAYING THAT NEW HOUSING SHOULD BE. ADDITIVE TO WHAT'S ALREADY THERE AND NOT REPLACING THE RESIDENTS ALREADY LIVING THERE THAT'S NOT THE GOAL THAT I HAVE AND. I KNOW IT'S NOT TO GO TO YOUR HOUSE OR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO DRAWS. ALL RIGHT.

WITH IDW AND SOME OF THE OTHER- OPPONENTS- ONE AMENDMENTS AND I- WE HAVE- I THINK ESSENTIALLY HAVE AN AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH WE'RE STILL WORKING ON TO SOME VERY TECHNICAL- ASPECTS OF IT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE UNIFICATION ASK FOR THE AGREEMENT. IS WE'VE AGREED- TO REMOVE- THE VIRTUAL READING OR RELAXING OR VIRTUAL REMOTE INSPECTION PIECE FROM THE BILL ENTIRELY SO THE BILL WOULD BE FOCUSED ON- THE- BASED ON- ON AUTOMATIC- OR AUTOMATIC BUT ONLINE. PERMITTING AND WE WILL BE ROOM. THE REMOTE AND- PIECE THERE ARE OTHER ASK. OF AMANDA THAT WE- BEEN WORKING WITH ON WATCH HIS CLIMB ON- AND I THINK CAN AGAIN IS HOT- SOME. DETAILS TO FINALIZE BUT I- MR WATCHING HIS CLIENTS WORKING CONTINUE TO FINALIZE THE LANGUAGE AND- AND THEN ON IT WOULD I WOULD ANTICIPATE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS- IN THE- ENERGY COMMITTEE IN A FEW WEEKS- IF. BILL PASSES OUT TODAY. BY THE COLLEAGUES- THIS IS PIECE SEVENTY- IS A BILL- DESIGNED TO- TO OUR FACILITATE THE PERMITTING OF- OF. THOSE OF SMALL SOLAR AND ENERGY STORAGE- INSTALLATIONS ON. RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP THIS ISN'T ABOUT LIKE LARGE SCALE IS ABOUT SMALL INSTALLATIONS. ON THIS LEGISLATURE YEARS AGO PASSED LEGISLATION TO STREAMLINE. THE PERMITTING- BUT WE STILL HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE IT CAN THE PRINTING PROCESS CAN BE VERY DELAYED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- WHICH INCREASE COSTS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND JUST DELAYS. THE INSTALLATION OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF. MEDIA CLEAN ENERGY GOALS INCREASING RESILIENCY AS WE LOOK FORWARD- TRAGICALLY TO WHAT I HOPE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER BAD WILD FIRE SEASON BUT- IT PASSES PROLOGUE- YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO BE. PREPARED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND CONSULTATION WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CODE- CODE ORGAN. BUILDING CODE ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH- HAS CREATED- AN OPTICAL SOLAR OP- THAT. OUR CITIES CAN USE TO. BASED ONLINE- EXPEDITED PERMITTING- THIS OP BASED ONLINE PERMITTING HAS SOME CITIES ARE ALREADY ADOPTING IN ADOPTED A LA- AS EITHER A DOCTOR IS MOVING TOWARDS ADOPTION OF ITS OWN VERSION. BILLS IS NOT TO SAY YOU HAVE TO USE A PARTICULAR APPLE THAT WE ANTICIPATE PEOPLE. WILL GENERALLY USE SOLAR OUT BECAUSE US DEPARTMENT RG DID A GREAT JOB. ON THIS OP THE OP IS FREE- BUT WE ALSO HAVE IN THE BILL- THERE'S A PARALLEL BUDGET. ITEM THAT IS MOVING FORWARD TO REPURPOSE AND SOLAR RELATED FUNDING. TO THE CITY'S CAN ACCESS GRANTS. TO DEFRAY ANY COSTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SETTING UP- THE PROGRAM. THERE IS A SICK OUT TO DO THIS- AND FRANKLY AS WE ALL SOMETIME THERE'S INERTIA- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THERE MAY BE SOME OFFICIALS THAT. WANT TODO IT BUT THIS WILL BE A PUSH TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE BILL DOES NOT HAVE PENALTIES FOR NOT DOING IT WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO BE PUNITIVE. BUT THIS IS A PUSH TO GET MORE CITIES- TO ACTUALLY DO THIS AND WE THINK THAT- IT WILL BE GOOD FOR CITIES ARE STILL GOING TO GET THE SAME- PERMIT FEES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN WITH- THE CURRENT WAY OF DOING THINGS- AND AS THE- CITY OF SAN JOSE- LEARN WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED THIS. THEIR PERMIT NUMBERS WENT UP BY MORE PERMIT FEES. FOR THE CITY- SO WE THINK THERE'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD- FOR OUR CLIMATE GOALS- AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN SOLAR AND ENERGY STORAGE.
