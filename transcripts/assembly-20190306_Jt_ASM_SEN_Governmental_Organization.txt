EVERYONE AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- MY NAME'S ADAM GRAY ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. AND I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE TODAY TO THE JOINT HEARING ON THE UTILIZATION. OF CURRENT AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO MODERATE ACTIVITY IN CAL FILED FOR IT TO BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN DON IS STAFF FOR HELPING TO PUT THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TOGETHER -- CALIFORNIA SUFFER DEVASTATING FIRE SEASON TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WE WENT WITNESS FROM THESE WILDFIRES WAS SIMPLY. UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS NOT JUST THE INTENSITY OF THE FIRES -- BUT THE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY SPREAD THAT SEEM TO CATCH SO MANY PEOPLE BY SURPRISE. BOTTOM LINE WE'RE SEEING LARGER MORE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TRIGGERED DEVASTATING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART. OF PREVENTING -- AND FIGHTING WILDFIRES HERE IN CALIFORNIA LESSEN BRACES EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO NOT ONLY REDUCE THE CATASTROPHIC RISKS POSED BY WILD FIRE. BUT ALSO SAVE LIVES SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE DRONES SENSORS SATELLITES FIRE MODELING WEATHER STATIONS REAL TIME CAMERAS TO MONITOR AREAS WITH A HIGH RISK FOR WILDFIRES. THIS AFTERNOON WE HEAR FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO BRING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WILD FIRE DETECTION MONITORING. WILD FIRE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS HAVE PROGRESSED BEYOND AN INDIVIDUAL ON LOOKOUT TOWER ARMED WITH BINOCULARS. I'M ENCOURAGED THAT ON THIS FIRST FULL DAY AS GOVERNOR. GAVIN NEWSOM ANNOUNCED EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO WILD FIRES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET -- INCLUDES NEW INVESTMENTS TO PREVENT FIGHT ESCAPE WILD FIRES REYES YOU RESPONSE TO LARGE RAPIDLY SPREADING WILD FIRES THAT THREATEN LIFE AND OR INFRASTRUCTURE. INVOLVES COORDINATION MULTIPLE ENTITIES AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. EACH OPERATING WITH DIFFERENT MISSIONS AND DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. TODAY WE'LL HEAR PRESENTATIONS IN CALIFORNIA -- AND CAL WE **** ABOUT HOW CURRENT NEW TECHNOLOGIES. ARE BEING OR MIGHT BE USED TO PREVENT. AND FIGHT WILDFIRES WE ALSO LEARNED HELMER IN A DECISION MAKERS ON HOW BEST TO RESPOND TO SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY FROM THE RAVAGES OF WILDFIRES. WE'VE ASSEMBLED SOME OF THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC MINDS VARIOUS ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS FROM WITHIN THE STATE WHO EDUCATE US ON SOME OF THE NEW -- AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES I MUST SAY EXCITING TECHNOLOGIES -- LASTLY WE'LL HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL FIREFIGHTING COMMUNITY RELATING TO HOW NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES BECOME AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF A MULTIFACETED RESPONSE PLANS -- HELPING TO PROTECT FIREFIGHTERS FIRST RESPONDERS AND OF COURSE OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR CHAIRMAN DOT FOR HIS OPENING REMARKS AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I THANK YOU I WROTE REALLY WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN GREATEST STAFF FOR HELPING US ORGANIZE IS HEARING. IT FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE COMMITTEE IS DONE IN RESPONSE THE DEVASTATING FIRES OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. I THINK THE CHAIRMAN HAS A SET THE TABLE QUITE NICELY. A VERY GREAT SET OF TALKING POINTS WHICH I'M NOT GONNA -- ADD ON TO YOU KNOW ANYMORE I THINK BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO PERSONALLY JUST THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE TO DAY TAKEN -- TIME OUT. THE RECOVERY WORKERS FIRST RESPOND A SINGLE PERSON WHO CAME. OUT TO OUR HELP WHEN WE WERE MOST IN NEED AND OF COURSE I'D LIKE TO THANK -- THE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY AS WELL. SO WITH THAT GERMAN. IT'S ALL YEAR. THANK CHAIRMAN. AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM TWO ON THE AGENDA. WE WOULD ASK -- JUST COMPUTERS -- TOM PORTER AND DIRECTOR AGAIN OR DID SHE TO PLEASE JOIN US UP FRONT FOR THEIR TESTIMONY START. IT WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH THE MISS PETERS FROM THE OHIO -- WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU -- AND PROCEED WITH YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THE SERGEANT IS PASSING OUT A HAND OUT RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU -- REALLY BUT MY ROLE TODAY IS TO HAVE THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES -- INVOLVED IN WILD FIRE RESPONSE AND JUST HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE CURRENT YEAR ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN RELATED TO WILDFIRES AS WELL AS AND SOME OF THAT BUDGET PROPOSALS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO WELFARE TECHNOLOGY. SO WHEN YOU HAVE A HAND OUT AND IF YOU CAN TURN TO PAGE. ONE I'M JUST HAVE A SUMMARY AS AND THAT THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES SO YOU HAVE -- DOCTOR PORTER IN DIRECTOR GIL DID SHE I'M FRIEND CAL FIRE AND YES HERE WITH YOU TODAY I'M -- YES IS ROLE IN A WILDFIRE RESPONSE IS SORT OF A HIGH LEVEL COORDINATION -- MISSION TASKING DIFFERENT ENTITIES -- BEING A CONDUIT FOR FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE STATE. I AM WHERE IS CAL FIRE IS THE ENTITY IN THE STATE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DIRECTLY RESPONDING WHEN THERE'S A FIRE OUT CALL WE WILL COME IN A NINE ONE ONE CALL. ON AND CAL FIRE AND RESPONSE CREWS WILL BE THE ONES WHO ARE SENT OUT. I ONCE A A FIRE IS IS PUT OUT -- AND CONTAINED THEN THE COW FIRES ROLL SORT OF SUBSIDES IN THE FIRE AND YES WELL I CONTINUE IN OVERSEE RECOVERY EFFORTS. ON IN TERMS OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER STATE AGENCIES I AM JUST TO KNOW THEY'RE NOT HERE TODAY BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU THAT CONTEXT AND THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN. A WELFARE RESPONSE AND SUPPRESSION I'M BRINGING THEIR RESOURCES AIRCRAFT AND GUARDS PEOPLE I'M TO BEAR TO FIGHT FIRES -- IN ADDITION AND CAL RECYCLE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ARE USUALLY OR OFTEN AND INVOLVED IN THE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES AFTER AWHILE FIRES HAPPENED. US DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL WILL GO IN AND REMOVE ALL OF THE TOXIC -- A WASTE AND HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND I'M WITH CAL FIRE IT'S NOT ALWAYS I'M COVER CYCLE IT'S NOT ALWAYS THEM BUT OFTEN I'M CAN BE THEM WELL OVERSEE THE CLEAN UP OF ASH AND DEBRIS IN REALLY THE BULK OF AND THE DEBRIS THAT'S LEFT AFTER A MAJOR WILDFIRE. I'M AND THERE'S OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN BOB WHAT WELFARE RECOVERY AS WELL SUCH AS DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. ON PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT WE HAVE A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE CURRENT YEAR ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN RELATED TO WILDFIRES. AND THAT THE CURRENT YOUR BUDGET PROVIDED AUGMENTATIONS OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS RELATED TO WILD FIRES. ON TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION AT THAT WAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOREST CARBON PLAN AS WELL AS OTHER I'M FORREST HEALTH ACTIVITIES. TURNER FORTY FIVE MILLION WAS EDITION ALL ENHANCING CAL FIRE IS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO FIRE SUCH AS HELICOPTERS. ON AND THEN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION FOR RECOVERY THAT WAS BUDGETED THERE'S OBVIOUSLY ADDITIONAL RECOVERY FUNDS THAT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WHEN SPECIFIC DISASTERS HAPPEN? I'M AND AS CHAIRMAN DIED HE OBVIOUSLY NOW AND SB NINE A WENDY -- COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE THAT CAME OUT OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER BILLS THAT WERE PASSED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO PUT TOGETHER THIS PACKAGE AS AND REALLY THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSE ON FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION AND LAYING OUT FRAMEWORK FOR HOW THE STATE WILL RESPOND -- GOING FORWARD TO THESE VERY SEVERE WILDFIRE SEASONS AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE HAD A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION. AND AND THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR JUST PROPOSED ON JANUARY TENTH INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS THAT'S REQUIRED BY SB NINE I WENT. AS WELL AS OTHER FINES FOR A VARIETY OF DEPARTMENTS TO HIRE STAFF AND ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMS IS CREATED BY THE PACKAGE. TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF A HAND OUT AND WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO IN ADDITION TO THESE FUNDING THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES IN THE BUDGET. AND THE GOVERNOR GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND AND ADDS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND TO ADD THE STATE'S FIRE RESPONSE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THAT LEDGE PACKAGE REQUIRES. AND REALLY WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUSING IS ON ENHANCING FIRE RESPONSE AND FIRE SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES. SERRA COMPARED TO THE LEGISLATIVE PACK PREVENTIVE AND FOREST HEALTH AND FOCUS SO THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE FOR FIRE RESPONSE -- IT CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT WE SUMMARIZING THE FIGURE ON TABLE THREE IT INCLUDES ABOUT NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OR SOME MINOR REIMBURSEMENT OFFSET THAT ROUGHLY NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS MOSTLY FOR PRETTY MUCH ALL IT ALL FROM THE GENERAL FUND I AM SMALL NON OF OTHER FUNDING. AND AND THIS WOULD BE FOR CAL FIRE TO RESPOND -- INC ENHANCE THEIR FIRE RESPONSE -- ACTIVITIES AND SO THIS INCLUDES YOU FIRE ENGINES HAIR TANKERS INCREASING STAFFING. AND THE WHEN IT PIECE OF THIS THAT WE WANTED IT PARTICULARLY CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO IS THE FIRE DETECTION CAMERAS OR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CAMERAS. I'M NOT REALLY RELATES TO THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING LOOKING AT EMERGING AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FRIEND OF FOR CALIFORNIA -- TO AND JOIN AN EXISTING NETWORK KNOWN AS ALERT WILDFIRE YOU HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM ALERT WILDFIRE ON YOUR NEXT PANEL TODAY. AND AND IT THIS WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA JOIN THAT NETWORK AND ALSO ADDED ONE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL WILD FIRE DETECTION CAMERAS TO THE NETWORK. THAT AND CAL FIRE WOULD BE ABLE AS I'VE DETECTING IN MONITORING WILDFIRES. AND THE ALERT WILDFIRE IS A CONSORTIUM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA RENO HE UC SAN DIEGO. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY FROM UC SAN DIEGO WHO'S PART OF THE ALERT WILDFIRE ON YOUR NEXT PANEL. I'M PAGE FOR THE HAND OUT WE SUMMARY THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE MADE RELATIVE TO THIS NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE AND ENHANCING OF FIRE RESPONSE AND CAPACITY AT CAL FIRE. AND AND WE WE JUST KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND CAL FIRE AND YES HAVEN'T PUT FORWARD IN RECENT YEARS. A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE FIRE RESPONSE. I'M CAPACITY IS IN THE STATE INCLUDING STATE LOCAL MUTILATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES. AND AND WHAT THE GAPS ARE AND AS WE THINKING ABOUT ADDING RESOURCES NINETY SEVEN MILLION THIS YEAR. AND THERE IS A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION I'M IN THE CURRENT YEAR THREE LIKELY THEY'LL BE MORE RESOURCES AND PROPOSED IN FUTURE YEARS TO CONTINUE ADDING. AN EQUIPMENT AND STAFFING TO RESPOND TO FIRES ON IS THAT WE THINK THAT HAVING AN ASSESSMENT OF REALLY WHERE WE ADDED A RESPONSE CAPACITY -- WHERE THOSE GAPS AND THEN HOW WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING AN INCREASE OF RESOURCES WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN FUTURE YEARS TO PLAN FOR WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK AND WE GONNA GET THEM ALSO BENEFITS IF YOU'RE ADDING -- ADDITIONAL FIRE RESPONSE RESOURCES. SO IN AYE RECOMMENDATION WE THINK THAT AND THIS ASSESSMENT SHOULD EVALUATE ALL TYPES OF FIRE RESPONSE RESOURCES AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THAT COULD INCLUDE TECHNOLOGY THERE'S NO REASON THAT THAT SHOULDN'T INCLUDE TECHNOLOGY -- AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND DECIDES TO ADOPT A RECOMMENDATION AND REQUIRE. CAL FIRE AND WE ASKED TO PRODUCE THIS ASSESSED ALL IT SHOULD AND THEY TAKE IN LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT ROLE SHOULD TECHNOLOGY PLAY. IN HOW WE RESPONDED TO FIRES AND IS THERE A WAY TO BE YOU KNOW MORE COST EFFECTIVE BY USING TECHNOLOGY AND AND HOW DOES THAT FIT IN WITH THE MORE TRADITIONAL FIRE RESPONSE. I'M STRATEGIES THAT THE STATE USES I'M AND I CAN BE ONE WAY OF ENSURING THAT WHATEVER ASSESSMENT THEY PUT FORWARD IS SOMETHING THAT'S FUTURE LOOKING AND REFLECTS SORT OF A MODERNIZED APPROACH. TO HOW THE STATE FIGHTS FIRES. AND SO I WILL JUST LEAVE MY COMMENTS THERE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'M EITHER NOW OR AFTER THE DIRECTORS MAKE THEIR PRESENTATIONS. THE COOL WAY TO THE END OF THE PANEL IN THE WALL. QUESTION SO MEMBERS IF YOU WOULD -- KEEP YOUR QUESTION SANDY WILL ASK THOSE AFTER ALL THREE PRESENTERS ARE FINISHED. THIS TIME WE'LL HEAR FROM. TOM PORTER DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA PART OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GRAY AND CHAIR DOT THANK YOU -- FOR HEARING THIS THIS IMPORTANT -- A JOINT HEARING AND THANK YOU THE REST OF YOU. FOR BEING HERE AS WELL -- WHAT I WANT TO GIVE YOU IS KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF OF WHAT -- THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE -- FOR WILDLIFE WILDFIRE IN PARTICULAR IN PARTICULAR BUT CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN. YOU CAN THINK OF THIS FROM AN ALL HAZARDS -- KIND OF PERSPECTIVE AS WELL -- THESE ARE FIRE CURRENTLY IS USING -- A NOR A AS FAR AS TECHNOLOGY IN OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND RESPONSE -- TO WILDFIRES AT AS STATED -- BUT ALSO -- OTHER EMERGENCIES SO -- IT'S OFTEN. THE FIRST WE HEAR ABOUT AN INCIDENT IS THROUGH THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND INCREASINGLY -- NINE ONE ONE IS IS -- THE CELLULAR BASE AND THE PLACE WHERE SOMEBODY ON A NINE ONE ONE CALL ON A CELLULAR SYSTEM IS NOT NECESSARILY. EVEN ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHERE THE ACTUAL INCIDENT IS OCCURRING -- THE TRADITIONAL NINE ONE ONE WE HAVE AN ADDRESS TO GO BACK TO WOULD BE ABLE TO GO AND TALK TO A PERSON AT THAT ADDRESS AND SEE FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE WHERE FIRE WAS. FOR INSTANCE -- IT NOW THAT'S NOT REALLY THE CASE AND SO IT TAKES IT TAKES US A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHERE -- FIRES ARE MORE -- THEN IN IN SOME CASES IN THE PAST -- LOOK OUTS WAS MENTIONED YES WE STILL ACTUALLY DO USE LOOKOUTS WITH VOLUNTEERS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY SITTING IN LOOK OUTS LOOKING FOR FIRES AND THEY CAN USE -- THE DIFFERENT DEVICES TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHERE THAT FIRE IS IT'S ACTUALLY MORE PRECISE THAN THAN -- NINE ONE ONE CALLER BUT IT'S LABOR INTENSIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM OR ENOUGH PEOPLE DOING THAT -- ANY LONGER SO WE HAVE IT WE USE FIXED CAMERAS AND AS JESSICA FROM LA -- MEN -- THE THE HUNDRED CAMERAS THAT ARE THAT ARE ON THE IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET BUT WHAT THOSE ARE HE IS RIGHT NOW VERY MUCH A SITUATION SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOL -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE USE FOR VALIDATION AND THAT THERE IS TRULY A FIRE IN AN AREA -- WE STILL ARE YOU ARE DISPATCHING ARE ARE -- RESOURCES BASED ON A NINE ONE ONE CALL A RADIO CALL. OR A LOOK A LOOK OUT CALL TO OUR COMMAND CENTER SO -- WE LAUNCH THE RESOURCES AND THEN WE TURN TO THE CAMERAS AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE CAMERAS AND SEE IF IF THERE ACTUALLY IS SMOKE IN THE AREA IT GIVES US. A SENSE OF OF HOW RAPIDLY -- AN INCIDENT IS GROWING AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE CURRENT -- CAMERA SYSTEM THAT IS OUT THERE -- OTHER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -- IT TOOLS THAT WE UTILIZE -- ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND STAFFED. FORMS -- THOSE THE FLY OVER THE TOP OF OF INCIDENTS AND GIVE US A LOOK. AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND CASES THROUGH THE SMOKE UNDER THE SMOKE NOW AND WE CAN SEE EXACTLY -- WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE -- AT THE THE OUT OF FIRE -- AND THEN USE THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS AS TO WHERE TO PUT POLICE RESOURCES IN THAT KIND OF THAT KIND OF THING -- WE DO HAVE OF MODELING TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE THEIR PROGRAMS THAT WILL -- USE VARIOUS INPUTS AND KICK OUT A PREDICTION OF WHERE A FIRE IS LIKELY TO GO AND WE USE THOSE -- THAT WE DON'T USE THOSE ON THE FIRE LINE BUT WE DO USE THOSE. AS A PLANNING AND PRE PLANNING TOOL -- IN IN OUR DAILY OPERATIONS -- FURTHER -- LET ME LET ME TALK ABOUT. WHAT THE STATE THROUGH CAL FIRE? AND OTHER PARTNERSHIPS ALREADY OWNS -- AND OPERATES AND IN SOME CASES FUNDS BUT DOESN'T OWN HOME -- WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF REMOTE -- AUTOMATED WEATHER STATIONS -- THESE ARE WEATHER STATIONS THAT ARE SCATTERED THE LANDSCAPE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE PART OF A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM. AND THEY UPLOAD ON AN HOURLY BASIS -- WHETHER FROM THOSE LOCATIONS THE PRINT T. BROAD THEY DON'T HAVE THEY ARE VERY GRANULAR. SO WE'VE HEARD IN THIS IN IN IN SIMILAR HEARINGS -- AND REMEMBER HUESO YOUR YOUR DISTRICT HAS A VERY FINE GRAIN LOOK AT THE WEATHER -- BEING -- THAT THAT THERE'S A WEATHER SYSTEM THAT IS ALMOST ON A MILE BY MILE BASIS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE WE DON'T HAVE THAT ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS ONE MAKE SURE MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND. OUR WROTE MORE REMOTE -- AUTOMATED WEATHER STATIONS ARE MILES AND MILES APART AND THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT A VERY A KIND OF A REGIONAL -- WHETHER AT BUT THEY DO GIVE US WHETHER ON AN HOURLY BASIS -- YEAR ROUND -- WE ALSO. HAVE -- A PREDICTIVE SERVICES UNIT IN -- EACH OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC -- COORDINATION CENTERS. ONE IN RIVERSIDE FOR THE SOUTH HALF OF THE STATE AND ONE IN REDDING FOR THE NORTH HALF OF THE STATE -- THIS IS A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM -- AND THOSE GEOGRAPHIC ACCORDING OUR ACROSS THE NATION -- CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY. STATE IN THE UNION THAT HAS. TO SO WE ARE. BIG ENOUGH AND WE HAVE A A A DIVERSE ENOUGH. KIND OF LANDSCAPE THAT WE REQUIRE TWO OF THESE CENTERS AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY LOOK AT FIRE WEATHER -- THEY LOOK AT FIRE WEATHER IN VERY GREAT DETAIL DOWN TO THE THE FINE FUELS AND THEIR FUEL MOISTURE AND HOW THAT'S CHANGING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE HEAVIER FUELS AND I'M TALKING ABOUT VEGETATION FUELS. AND HOW THOSE ARE ARE AFFECTED ON A SEASONAL BASIS. AND THEY DRY OUT IN THE SPRING AND THEN THEY DON'T VOICE AND UP UNTIL WELL INTO THE WINTER -- THEY THEY LOOK AT THE SEASONALITY AND THEN THEY AND THEN THE WEATHER -- THAT'S HAPPENING AS WELL AND THEY UTILIZE ALL OF THOSE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE -- A PRODUCT THAT'S GIVEN FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW WHAT WHAT IS MY RISK OF HAVING A LARGE A DAMAGING FIRE TODAY. AND TOMORROW. AND THEN THEY HAVE A SEVEN THE GIVES US TODAY THROUGH. NEXT WEEK AND THEN THEY HAVE A SEASONAL OUTLOOK THEY GIVES US. FOR ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHAT WHAT THE SEASON IS LOOKING LIKE AND IF WE'RE GOING GOING INTO DROUGHT CONDITIONS COMING OUT OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS ALL THOSE THINGS THAT AFFECT. KIND OF THAT LONG TERM. PLANNING AND ALL OF THAT'S DONE THROUGH THOSE TWO CENTERS AND THEY THEY PROVIDE THAT DAILY -- TO OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS -- THROUGH THEIR WEBSITES -- THAT ARE ALL UNDER THE THE GAS TAX. SO. WE HAVE THOSE -- SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOL -- SITUATIONAL AWARENESS COLLABORATION TOOL -- WHICH IS SCALP THAT IS -- JOINT OF PROJECT -- FOR A PLATFORM THAT WE CAN WE CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THESE -- TYPES OF DATA ON ONE PLACE AT ONE TIME THAT'S IN COLLABORATION -- WITH WITH -- SHE AND AND A CALLOW YES CAL FIRE -- AS PRIMARIES IN THAT AND AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE USING OUR I KNOW I I AND MANNED -- AERIAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS -- WHEN WE HAVE INCIDENTS WE CAN PUT THOSE IN THE AIR THROUGH A CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD -- THE DOMESTIC -- OPERATIONS WE CAN GET INTO WHEN WE HAVE A LARGER -- INCIDENT THAT REQUIRES A MILITARY RESPONSE THAT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH ACCOUNT CAL GUARD AGAIN. TO ACCESS -- ASSETS THAT WOULD BE -- ABLE -- TO LOOK AT THAT -- THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -- AS WE HAD TO MOVE FURTHER INTO. OUTER SPACE. WE DO THROUGH -- THROUGH NASA AND THROUGH -- THE NEED TO SEE WHICH IS THE NATIONAL INTERAGENCY FIRE CENTER WE HAVE ACCESS TO A REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES -- THAT WE CAN WE CAN TURN ON AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE THOSE WOULD INCLUDE -- THINGS LIKE -- GEO SPACE -- TOOLS THROUGH THE MOTOR SATELLITE AND AND GOES SATELLITE NOTICES OF MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGERY -- SPECTROMETER THE THESE DON'T GIVE US A VERY FINE GRAIN LOOK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT RIGHT NOW OUR LOOK FROM OUTER SPACE -- GIVES US LARGE BLOCKS ON A MAP THAT SHOW US WHERE HEAT SIGNATURES ARE THEY'RE NOT VERY TIGHT. WE CAN'T I COULDN'T WALK YOU TO A PLACE. WHERE A HEAT SIGNATURE WAS FROM -- WE CAN WITH THE AERIAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS WHICH WE HAVE -- THAT ARE THROUGH THE THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THINGS LIKE -- THE FIRE WATCH -- COBRA HELICOPTERS. AND NYROP SWITCHES -- NIGHT FLYING -- INFRARED. OPERATIONS THAT WE PUT OVER FIRES. EVERY NIGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THE FIRE WAS LAST NIGHT BUT BY THE TIME I GET THAT LOOK AT IT IN THE MORNING SORRY. LOOK AT IN THE MORNING THE FIRES MOVED. SO THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT WE ARE AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WE NEED TO PULL TOGETHER -- BUT THAT THAT IS A A BROAD LOOK AT WHAT CURRENTLY CAL FIRE AND THE FIRE SERVICES USING -- FOR WILD FIRE KIND OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ON THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT. THANK YOU AND I'LL TAKE QUESTIONS WENT ON YOUR REQUEST. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WELCOME TO DRESS GO DUTY. GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE AND CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIR THANKS FOR HAVING US HERE -- SO -- JUST TO KIND OF CAPITALIZE ON ON CHEAP PORTERS -- COMMENTS -- YOU KNOW -- YES IS ROLE COORDINATION OF ASSETS AND DECISION MAKING AND MAJOR EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN THE STATE -- YOU KNOW I DON'T LAST YEAR -- WAS A ANOTHER CRAZY YEAR -- FOR AND IMPACTFUL YEAR FOR FIRES -- CAL FIRE BUT PROBABLY FUNDED MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND FIRES BUT IT WAS REALLY A SERIES OF ABOUT -- OF FOUR FIVE MAJOR FIRES THAT WOULD RESULT IN A COMPLETE STATE WIDE RESPONSE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT -- THOSE OPERATIONS AND IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER -- IS WHERE ALL THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES COME TOGETHER AND HAVING GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS HAVING GOOD DATA -- THEY CAN TO BE TURNED IN THE DATA ANALYTICS AND HELP WAS THEN MAKE DECISIONS IN A VERY RAPID WAY -- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT. THAT WELL -- WELL TACTICALLY ON THE GROUND -- OPERATIONS CENTER IS THE GAS TAX THAT -- TOM AND MENTIONED -- ALL OF THAT RULES UP INTO OUT STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE -- WITH REGARDS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING NO. ONE INCIDENT REALLY. TENDS TO BE CONFINED TO ONE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THEY ARE FIRES TEND TO NOT LOOK AT BOUNDARIES AND THEY SPREAD VERY RAPIDLY PARTICULARLY THE EXTREME FIRES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN THE STATE. BUT WE'RE AN ALL HAZARDS ORGANIZATION SO IT COULD BE THE WAY THAT -- WE GET FLOODING WHERE WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF RAIN AND THAT IS SIERRA FRONT BUT THE WAY THE WATER FLOWS IN CALIFORNIA WE GET FLOODING IN THE LOWER -- A COUNTIES MUCH LIKE WE'RE SEEING NOW IN CINEMA -- AND HUMBLED AND PARTS OF MENDOCINO WHERE YOU'RE GETTING A LOT OF OF OF OF FLOW COMING DOWN SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION AWARENESS THE CAPABILITIES IN A VERY BROAD. PERSPECTIVE IN THE ABILITY -- TO AND APPROPRIATE -- TO WHILE -- FOR ARE WHAT JUST ONE OF THE HAZARDS WHEN I MENTION FLOOD EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER -- ANY SITUATION AWARENESS TOOLS ARE IMPORTANT FOR US. IN FOR ON THE FRONT END OF THESE ADVANCED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CASE A WILDFIRE THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE ARE -- WORKING TO REFINE OUR ABILITY TO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAYS WHERE HAVE A RED FLAG WARNING -- THAT ENCOMPASSES. FIVE OR SIX COUNTIES -- WHAT ACTUALLY DOES THAT MEAN -- WITH REGARDS TO HOW DO WE PLACE RESOURCES -- THEY ARE PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES IN A PLACE THAT IF THERE'S A FIRE START WE CAN BE VERY VERY -- RAPIDLY GET ON THAT AND AND MINIMIZE THE THE SPREAD -- WE KNOW THAT THE CAL FINDING IT MERELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS RESPONDING IMMEDIATELY -- BUT THE ONE OF THE ROLES OF ALL WE ASK IS TO BRING TOGETHER ALL THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THEY YES ASSETS. TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND SUPPORT -- FIRES THAT THAT CAL FIRE IS HAVING TO MANAGE -- THE BECOME THAT ARE MOVING VERY RAPIDLY. SO IF WE GET A RED FLAG CONDITION -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IS BEING ABLE TO BE FINE -- THOSE MICROCLIMATES SO THOSE THOSE THOSE -- AREAS WHERE. THROUGH THE CAMERAS THE TOM MENTIONED TO THE WEATHER STATIONS THAT THAT THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED -- WE CAN WE CAN REALLY GET THAT DATA AND REFINED WHERE THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF A FIRE STARTS ARE GOING TO BE WAR MAYBE THE HIGHEST IMPACT ARE GOING TO BE BASED UPON -- DENSITY OF THE COMMUNITY -- BASED UPON THE WILDFIRE MAPS THAT -- AND HISTORICAL DATA THE CALIFORNIA AS THAT ALL OF US TO BE INTEGRATED MUCH LIKE A FUSION CENTER HAS TO BECOME COME TOGETHER -- TO BE ABLE -- TO EFFECTIVELY APPLY RESOURCE MINIMIZE -- THE AMOUNT OF OF DAMAGE -- YOU KNOW BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD -- YOU KNOW OF THE FIRES AND IN THE NORTH BAY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEN AGAIN IN. EIGHTEEN BETWEEN THOSE TWO INCIDENTS WE LOST CLOSE TO THIRTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES -- IS IS IS A PHENOMENAL TWO YEARS AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE -- OUR SITUATION AWARENESS ARE -- UP YOU KNOW AUTOMATED INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES -- FROM BUT THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO HELP US MAKE OUR DECISIONS OF MORE RAPIDLY. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN -- THESE FIRES ARE MOVING SO FAST THAT WE ARE. AT THAT COORDINATION LEVEL AT THE WITH REGARDS TO BEING ABLE TO GET REAL TIME -- THE DATA ON ON FIRE PERIMETERS OR IMPACTS AND SO WE'RE HAVING TO DO A LOT MORE INTENSIVE COORDINATION WITH THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS ON THE GROUND. AND COMMUNICATING UP INTO THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER -- ON HOW HOW -- HOW RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AND AND WHERE WE WE PLACE THEM -- THIRD REPORTER MENTIONED THE SCALP THE THE SITUATIONAL WEARS A COLLABORATIVE TOOL THIS IS UP -- OF A PRETTY PHENOMENAL CAPABILITY THAT WE'VE WE'VE JOINTLY INVESTED IN -- IT WAS -- ORIGINALLY -- IS FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND UP WAS A CAPABILITY THAT WAS -- BILL BY MIT LINCOLN LABS -- AND THEN IT WAS GIVEN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE BOTH ARE ORGANIZATIONS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN BEING ABLE TO BUILD OUT -- WILL -- WHAT THAT PLATFORM WOULD LOOK UTILIZATION FOR EYES ALSO INCLUDE A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE? AND THIS THIS. COLLABORATIVE TOOL NOW -- REALLY IT GIVES US YEAH -- SOME REAL TIME CAPABILITY TO FACILITATE TACTICAL INFORMATION SHARING AMONGST ALL THE RESPOND OR IS THERE IN THE FIELD AS WELL AS INTER AGENCY. SITUATION WHERE THIS THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR COLLABORATIVE TOOLS THAT WE HAD THAT WE CAN ALL BE LOOKING AT SIMULTANEOUSLY TO BE ABLE -- TO A BIT MAKE DECISIONS AND MOVE RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY AND OF THERE AREN'T THERE ARE CLOSE TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED USERS NOW -- ON THE REGISTERED USERS ON SCALP AND UP REALLY IT IT HELPS AS WITH INCIDENT LOCATION IN PERIMETER -- IT HELPS AS WITH OUR OUR UP A BRANCH OF DIVISION BREAKS WITH DIRECTOR PORTER MENTION -- WHERE OUR COMMAND POST THE STAGING ITS IN SUPPORT LOCATIONS ARE -- HOW WE DO EVACUATION AREAS HOW MANY -- STRUCTURES COULD POTENTIALLY BE IMPACTED -- AS FIRE SPREAD HAPPENS AND THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN WE SEEK FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL BECAUSE EARLY ON IN A LOT OF THESE FIRES -- WE ARE -- SEEKING WHAT'S CALLED THE FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANT FROM THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY THOSE F. MAJOR CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVIDE IMMEDIATE -- FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET THE COST OF OF THAT INITIAL RESPONSE BUT THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA. THAT ARE REQUIRED AND IN THIS COLLABORATIVE TOOL HELPS US TO IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY -- THAT INFORMATION THAT COLLABORATIVE TOOLS ALSO TIED TO INITIATIVES THAT -- MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE -- BUT CAL FIRE AND YES STARTED A VEHICLE OKAY THAT'S THAT'S ABILITY THAT SOURCES ASTOR MOVING AROUND THE STATE IN REAL TIME AND BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON WE'RE REPLACING THOSE IN TRACK THEM -- AFFECTED LEE -- ALSO WE'LL TALK A LOT ABOUT -- SOME OF THE OTHER MODALITIES THAT WE'RE USING -- THAT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER HAS ABILITY TO TIE INTO. A MANY THE CAMERAS THAT -- TRUCK REPORTER TALKED ABOUT ALSO ALL OUR CALTRANS CAMERAS -- THERE'S A A NUMBER OF PRIVATE SECTOR CAMERAS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS -- TO TO BE ABLE -- TO PULL I DATE A AND TO BE -- TO MAKE DECISIONS -- ARE WE HAVE -- THE BASE LIKE CAPABILITY WITHIN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER BASED ON EVERY PLATFORM -- GIVES AS DATA THAT WE CAN TURN IT ANALYTICS THE KIND OF SHOW -- SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY TOOLS THAT BASED UPON THE THAT THE DATA THAT WE'RE GETTING WHETHER WHETHER IT'S A FOUGHT A FIRE FLOOD OR EARTHQUAKE -- GIVES US THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY -- PUT NUMBERS -- AND METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE FIELD. OUT WE AUGMENT THAT WITH THINGS LIKE -- TASKING THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD TO PROVIDE SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT -- TO BE ABLE TO DO FIRE PERIMETER MAPPING OR DAMAGE ASSESSMENT ON THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURES THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. OR DAMAGED IT HELPS US DETERMINE WHERE FLOOD -- BY WATERS ARE MOVING AND SO THE SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU HEAR MORE ABOUT THE SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT -- AND IN A LATER PRESENTATION -- FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE THAT WE ENGAGE WITH AS WELL TO HELP US WITH THAT THAT PROCESS -- DIRECTOR POR ALSO MENTIONED UNMANNED AERIAL OR OR DRONES -- WE DO TASK NATIONAL GUARD FOR THE DO YOU OF TWENTY FOUR AND AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE AND BEING ABLE -- TO YOU SOME OTHER INFRARED TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US -- ON THE GROUND VISUALIZATION AND AGAIN THERE'S SOME AERIAL IMAGERY IN THESE IN THESE GRAPHICS THAT SHOW -- THE FAR RIGHT SOME OF THE WHAT WE'RE SEEING OUT OF THOSE DRONE PICTURES THEY CAN FLY AT NIGHT THEY CAN FLY IN THE DAY THEY CAN CUT TO SOME OF THE SMOKE AND THAT'S VERY VERY -- HELPFUL FOR US -- LASTLY -- DIRECTOR PORTER MENTIONED -- SATELLITES AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW WE USE OUR THE NASA SATELLITES SYSTEM -- NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SYSTEM BUT WE ALSO HAVE BEEN -- TESTING -- PRIVATE SECTOR SATELLITE CAPABILITIES -- TO SEE ABOUT IF WE CAN ENHANCE OUR ABILITY USED AS AND AND THEY HAVE PROVEN SORT OF FIFTY FIFTY WITH REGARDS -- TO THE ABILITY THAT THEY BRING TO US -- AND AND WHETHER THAT INVESTMENT THE SECTOR SATELLITES ACTUALLY -- ARE ARE WORTH OUR OUR EFFORT -- SO -- I I I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT GOING ON IN THE AREA OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND IN -- THE ABILITY TO GET GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE -- BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE IN A IN AN INTEGRATED -- COLLABORATIVE FASHION -- GIVEN THE FACT THAT OF THE WAY WE DO OPERATE IN THE STATE -- WITH STATE AND LOCAL ALL OUR MUTUAL AID ASSETS -- AND EVENTUALLY THIS WILL TIE INTO -- ARE ENHANCEMENT OF OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM -- OR OR HIS NINE ONE ONE IN OUR ABILITY -- TO MOVE INTO WHAT'S CALLED FIRST NET WHICH IS A BROADBAND BEING. INTEROPERABLE I DATA PLATFORM -- TO BE ABLE TO SHE SHARE REAL TIME DATA WITH RESPONDENTS SO THAT WOULD BE P. MUTUALLY TEAMS ARE RESPONDING TO SUPPORT CAL FIRE FIRES -- THEY'RE ACTUALLY SEEING AS THE RESPONDING A GETTING DATA -- SO THAT THOSE STRIKE TEAM COMMANDERS CAN BE MAKING DECISIONS. EVEN BEFORE THEY ARRIVE -- INTO THE THE AREA OF OPERATION RIGHT NOW THEIR LITTLE BIT BLIND UNTIL THEY GET IN THE EVERY OPERATION THEY GET ASSIGNMENTS THIS IS GOING TO BE -- AN EFFORT TO EXPAND THAT -- THAT CAPABILITY -- AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY TO THE WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED HIM TO TO DO IT ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT ASSESSMENTS DONE -- IN A FROM THE PAST BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE -- TWO OF THEM ACTUALLY -- SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THAT OUTLINED MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND SINCE THAT TIME BOTH ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR PARTNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE U. S. FOR SERVICE. THE OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES A FEMA HAVE WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE RECOMMENATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH -- IN THOSE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS AND UP THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPED US TO GET WERE OUT TODAY WITH OUR CAPABILITY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELS THAT YOU DIRECTOR -- GOOD YOU SHE AND I THINK WE HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO WE'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS MEMBERS RIGHT NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND -- STICK AROUND WE'LL START WAS CENTERED HUESO. THANK YOU -- I GUESS THE NUMBER ONE RULE. OF FIGHTING FIRE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIVENESS AND HOW FAST WE CAN GET TO THOSE FIRES AND AND USUALLY THE FASTER YOU GET TO THEM THE LIKELIHOOD THEY'LL BE SMALLER. AND AND LESS LESS DEVELOPED. SO LOOKING AT AT THE THE PRESENTATION TODAY I I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU SAID AND SATELLITES BECAUSE BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED SATELLITES. AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AND SATELLITES IS VERY ADVANCED AT ANY GIVEN POINT WE HAVE MULTIPLE SATELLITES I JUST. ONE THAT THE GOVERNMENT USES MAINLY FOR SURVEILLANCE. WINDOWS PRINT PRINCIPLE DEVELOPMENT OF OF SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY BY BY THE GOVERNMENT NASA -- AND AND SO WE CAN GET. REALLY DETAILED INFORMATION FROM THESE VERY -- HI. THESE THESE THESE. OUR CAMERAS THAT HAVE A VERY HIGH RESOLUTION ABLE TO FOCUS VERY IN DEPTH AND IF IF. WE CAN USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY SMOKE. AND WE HAVE -- THE EQUIPMENT. THAT IS SPREAD OUT -- GEOGRAPHICALLY -- IN A COORDINATED FASHION -- WE CAN RESPOND TO THESE FIRES MUCH QUICKER LET'S SAY -- MOBILIZING IN YOU KNOW WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEAREST THAT INCIDENT COULD BE HELICOPTER COULD BE -- YOU KNOW HELICOPTER AND FIRE TRUCKS [inaudible] SO. WHY HAVEN'T WE LOOK AT SATELLITE LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF? IT MAY BE JUST. QUITMAN SPACE AVAILABLE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SUPPORT YEAR. IS THAT SOMETHING THEY CAN DO TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE STATE AND HELPING US TO PROVIDE THAT SURVEILLANCE INTERSTATE THROUGH SATELLITE EQUIPMENT AND CAN SATELLITE EQUIPMENT. MONITOR. WITH SOMEBODY THERE LOOKING SPECIFICALLY FOR SMOKE AND FIRES AND AND ANYTHING THAT CAN. POTENTIALLY. YOU KNOW BURN RIGHT IN OUR FORCE BECAUSE CAMERAS I MEAN THEY'LL BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO SITUATE CAMERAS ALL OVER THE ALL OVER THE STATE SPECIALLY. AND THE LEAST POPULATED AREAS WHERE THERE'S LESS LIKE THIS SOMEBODY CAN CALL IN NINE ONE ONE SEX MALE SMOKERS SEE SMOKE. HARDER IN FOURS BUT FROM WITH THE SATELLITE. HE COULD ALMOST SEE ANYTHING ANYWHERE AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND A SMALL INCIDENT OF SMOKE. COULD BE THAT TRIGGER THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT SENATE. HELICOPTER THERE. LEE AND AND I KNOW YOU YOU MENTIONED A WELL WE FIRST ONE ASSESS THAT SMOKER. DO WE HAVE TO WAIT. FOR THAT FIRE TO DEVELOP BEFORE WE WE WE SEND SOMEBODY TO ESPECIALLY IN A IN AN AREA. THAT IS A HIGH RISK AREAS SHOULD WE SHOULD WE BE A LITTLE MORE -- WILLING -- TO DEPLOY [inaudible] OUR RESOURCES. AND AND WAIT LESS TO GATHER INFORMATION YOU KNOW THAT SO. SATELLITES FIRST OF ALL. WELL I STARTED IT ALL TURNED OVER TO THE DIRECT PORTER -- SO -- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING A LOT AND THE SATELLITES AND AND I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF US -- KIND OF WATCH WHAT YOU KNOW DID SHE SHOWS WHERE THEY CAN. NAVIGATE THE SATELLITE AND LOOK DOWN AND SEE EXACTLY WHETHER OUT AND AND AND THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST -- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE CAPABILITY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FRANCE WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HERE DOMESTICALLY -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO TRY -- TO GET THEM TO DECLASSIFY SOME CAPABILITIES -- OF THAT SATELLITE MORE OR WORK CLOSELY WITH US -- TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IN THE IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT ACTUALLY COMING THE FULL FLOURISH AND YOU KNOW WE DO YOU WE DO EMPLOYEE SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY NOW -- BUT AS AS THE DRUG FOR MATCH AND YOU KNOW THE SATELLITES. THE ORBIT SO YOU'RE GETTING A A A PIECE OF TIME AND IN SOME OF THAT DATA IS REALLY GOOD BUT SINCE WE'RE NOT CONTROLLING THE SATELLITES YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE TO SAY OKAY YOU KNOW. CHANGE THAT THE APERTURE THAT SATELLITE AND JUST GET IT THE FOCUS IN ONE SPOT -- WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- WE THIS PAST FIRE SEASON WE DID TEST SOME PRIVATE SECTOR SATELLITES AND AND THEY DO. THEY DID PROVE TO GIVE US IN FACT SOME OF THE PICTURES HERE ARE FROM THAT PARTICULAR SATELLITE. BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T -- HAVE CERTAIN KINDS OF INFRARED AND OTHER KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU WE NEED SO THE NEXT OPTION WOULD BE TO POSSIBLY YOU KNOW. LARGER ON SATELLITE OR HAVE OUR OWN CAPABILITY THAT WE CAN MANEUVER THAT BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S PROMISING WORK THAT'S BEING DONE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT ONLY OUR STATE THAT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY MAYBE THE ENTIRE WORLD WOULD BE. WOULD IF THERE WAS SOME COOPERATIVE EFFORT TO SHARE INFORMATION YEAH -- AND AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OF LOOKING FOR FIRES YOU KNOW. TO THAT THAT IF IF BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AT ANY GIVEN TIME HAS SOME BE OF OUR STATE. EVEN WITH THE ROAD TO PERDITION OF OUR OF THE SATELLITES BECAUSE A MULTIPLE SATELLITES TO YOU. TO BACK FILL IN. AND AT SOME POINT THEY COULD REALLY HELP US IN THAT ASPECT. THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION WAS ABOUT COVERAGE I MEAN. YOU THERE IS -- FORCED CARBON PLAN THIS MENTIONED. AND HOW WE ENHANCED OUR BUDGET BY SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION WHICH IS A VERY HEALTHY SUM OF MONEY. AND COUPLED WITH FEDERAL FIREFIGHTING IN. OF RESOURCES IN OUR STATE BASED. DOES I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT CARBON PLAN. BUT DOES IT ASSESS OUR READINESS TO COMBAT FIRES STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF HAVING THE RESOURCES NECESSARY. AND TO BE PREPARED FOR THESE EVENTS AND TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO THESE EVENTS AND I'M MOSTLY CONCERNED OR ARE WE READY TO RESPOND QUICKLY DO WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED. SURE SO IN TERMS OF THE FIRST CARBON PLAN IS FOCUSED MORE ON OF FOREST HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND RIGHT NOW. AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STATE IS FORESTED AND AND A LARGE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE FORESTS ARE IN AN UNHEALTHY CONDITION WHERE THERE. TO DANCE THERE'S MANY DEAD OR DYING TREES AND AND THIS JUST CREATES A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF AND VEGETATION FUELS THAT CAN. RESULT IN THESE I AM EXTREMELY SEVERE FIRES AND SO THE FOREST CARBON PLAN AND A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IS FOCUSING MORE ON HOW OVER THE LONG TERM DO WE MAKE THE FORESTS IN THE STATE. HEALTHIER IS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT AS PRONE TO THESE VERY DESTRUCTIVE FIRES AND THEN -- SEPARATELY THROUGH BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS AND IN RECENT YEARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HER PROVIDED THESE ADDITIONAL FIRE RESPONSE RESOURCES AND SO YOU HAVE THESE. YOU KNOW TWO DIFFERENT PRIORITIES FULL TO MAKE OUR FIRST HEALTHIER SO THERE'S LESS SEVERE FIRES AND LOWERS THAT RISK -- AS WELL AS INCREASING CAL FIRE AND YES IS ABILITY TO RESPOND AND I'LL LET THAT DOCTOR PORTER. YES SAID. THE POOREST CARBON PLAN REALLY. GIVES US -- A BLUEPRINT OF WHAT THE ENVIRONMENT LOOKS LIKE THE THE THIS STATE -- FIRE STRATEGIC PLAN KIND OF GIVES US A FRAMEWORK OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO THAT WHICH IS. IS REALLY A HOLISTIC APPROACH WHICH INCLUDES RESOURCES AS WELL AS A MEETING BY RESPONDING RESOURCES AS WELL AS THE TREATMENTS THAT WE WOULD DO PRO ACTIVELY AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER -- PROVIDE A SYSTEM OF OF FOREST AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE THAT WILL. THAT WILL REDUCE THE EFFECTS AND THE RISK OF WILDFIRE IN THE FUTURE -- SO THOSE ARE THOSE ITEMS -- I THINK THERE IS SOME PROMISE IN THE FUTURE ON ON THE THE SATELLITE FRONT I THINK THERE THERE REALLY ISN'T THAT SOMETHING -- AS DIRECTOR GILLARD YUJI MENTION WE WILL BE WORKING TOWARD WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE -- AND THERE ARE THE HURDLES THAT THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BUT I WANTED ALSO TO MAKE SURE -- THAT I DIDN'T MISS SPEAK -- RELATED TO WHAT I'LL CALL GET AWAY TIME THAT IS THE TIME THAT THE THE ALARM GOES OFF IN THE FIRE STATION. TWO TWO MINUTES FROM THEN THAT THE ENGINES ON THE ROAD GOING TO WHATEVER THE INCIDENT HE IS -- GET AWAY TIME IS IS CRITICAL TO US SO GET AWAY TIME IS THE TIME FROM WHEN THEY GET WHEN I GET THE CALL. TO WHEN I'M DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD TO GET TO THE CALL -- THE LAG THAT THAT WE WE HAVE A SO THAT IS A TWO MINUTE WINDOW. THE LAG THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT COULD BE -- SH DO REDUCED BY THESE OTHER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CAPABILITIES WOULD BE THE REPORT TIME. AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE WE NEVER ONCE THAT ONCE THERE'S A REPORT WHETHER THEIR SMOKE IN THE AIR OR NOT WE'RE LAUNCHING. SO WE LAUNCH AN AIRCRAFT DURING THE PEAK OF SEASON. THERE ARE AIR TANKERS HELICOPTERS BULLDOZERS -- AND ENGINES AND HAND HAND CREWS ALL HEADED TO A POINT ON EARTH THAT SOMEBODY SAID THERE'S A FIRE EVEN IF THERE'S NO SMOKE IN THE AIR. SO THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -- CAPABILITY THAT WE USE THAT THOSE CAMERAS FOR NOW IS SO I I AM SITTING AT MY CONSOLE TO GET ALL THAT STUFF ON THE ROAD. AND NOW I'M DOING EACH CALL BACKS -- SAYS HEY LET'S LET'S PULL IT UP SO WE CAN LOOK AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE AREA THE ZOOM IN ON ORG OR THEY PAN TO OR LOOK AT THE CAMERA THAT'S LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION. AND THEN THEY START TO GO OKAY THIS IS REAL THIS THING IT'S BUILDING BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST YOU CAN SEE FROM A SMOKE AT AN EARLY AGE. WHETHER IT'S IT'S JUST KIND OF A WISPY OR IF IT'S BUILDING QUICKLY AND SO THEN THEY'LL START TO TUNE THEMSELVES HEY. FRED GO GO GET ON THE PHONE WE'RE GONNA BE HERE ALL NIGHT WORKING ON THIS ONE START GETTING PEOPLE COMING BACK TO WORK. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WERE USING IT FOR IN THE CENTER -- AND THEN THE RESOURCES ON THE GROUND ARE STILL USING. THEIR THEIR HELICOPTER SEEM LIKE THE WISEST INVESTMENT FOR OUR STATE IN TERMS OF RESPONSE OF HAVING AT LEAST SOMETHING TO BE ABLE. TO DROP A LOT OF WATER OR OR A FIRE RETARDANT ON ON A FIRE HOW MANY OF THOSE THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. SO RIGHT NOW WE WE HAVE OUR OUR HUGH EASE THAT ARE THERE TWELVE PLUS THE RESERVE AND THEN. WE WE HAVE -- TWELVE NEW HELICOPTERS -- BLACKROCK STYLE TO THEIR SEVENTY AYE HELICOPTERS THAT ARE COMING THOSE ARE JUST CAL FIRES RESOURCES -- SO SORRY SOME AREAS MAY HAVE. HELICOPTERS SOME MAY NOT. THEY GENERALLY AND HIGHER FIRE PRONE AREAS AND WHAT KIND OF I MEAN OTHER I GUESS THE QUESTION IS -- WERE WHERE WE HAVE -- HI FIRE PRONE AREAS AND THAT'S A LOT OF ACREAGE I'VE SEEN THE MAP THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT THE WHOLE STATE. HOW MUCH HOW MANY? HOW MANY HELICOPTERS PER ACRE I MEAN IT'S ALMOST WE ALMOST HAVE TO DO THIS THE MAP THAT WAY? YEAH WE AND WE WE TWENTY FOUR HELICOPTERS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT. WELL AND IT'S IT'S FEWER THAN THAT ON THE CAL FIRE SIDE BUT THERE ARE FEDERAL HELICOPTERS AND AIR TANKERS WE HAVE AIR TANKERS AS WELL. AS WELL AS AIR ATTACK -- THAT THAT IS A IN A PLANE AND THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS A LOT OF THESE RESOURCES AS WELL PARTICULARLY HEALTH KERR WHO'S A REX SYSTEM. WHAT A FEDERAL HELICOPTER OR MUNICIPAL HELICOPTER BE DEPLOYED AT WHOSE DIRECTION? USUALLY IT'S IT IS NOT -- YES IS IT IS. IT WOULD BE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA RIPLEY FEDERAL THE FOREST SERVICE -- DISPATCH CENTER IF IT'S IN -- WILDLAND RESPONSE AREA. ONE OF THOSE TWO AND THEN WE WOULD EXPAND FROM THERE -- AS WE NEEDED MORE AND ALL THEIR MEALS AS YOU WOULD BE AWARE MADE AWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR FIRE WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH FEDERAL OR STATE OR MUNICIPAL. YOU'D BE AWARE YES AND THE THOSE TWO COORDINATING CENTERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE WEATHER IS IS COMING OUT OF FOR THE ROOF OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS -- A READING AND AND REVERSE AND THIS AND THEN OUR DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR -- COUNTERPARTS AS WELL ALL WORKING TOGETHER SO SO THEY'RE THEY'RE COORDINATING THEIR CORNING THE THE THE AERIAL KIND OF RESPONSE TO WILD FIRES AND THEN. COORDINATING THE MOVEMENT OF RESOURCES AROUND THE STATE AND INTO THE STATE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHARE. THANK YOU -- WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF MEMBERS THAT QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING. TO AT THIS TIME -- GO TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND ALL THE WORK YOU AND YOUR TEAM TO DO -- I JUST MY FIRST QUESTION GOES -- TO MISS PETERS -- I WAS LOOKING AT ON PAGE THREE THE LITTLES COME OUT OF THE FIRE THE THE PROPOSALS. MY CONCERN IS ON THIS IS FOR SOME THIRTEEN BRAND NEW FIRE ENGINES AND MIKE WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM IS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF OUR FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT IS GETTING OLD. IT'S BEEN USED A LOT OF THEM I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST THOSE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT WE HAVE THE CORRECT -- TOOLS THEY CAN THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB SO IS THAT IN ADDITION TO AND ARE THE ON ORDER I HOPE BECAUSE IT TAKES YEARS AGO. YOU SAID THESE ARE ADD NEW ADDITIONAL ENGINES -- SO THIS WOULD INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FIRE ENGINES THAT CAUGHT FIRE HAS AND ALSO INCREASE HE NUMBER THAT ARE OPERATED ON EACH YEAR ROUND BASIS -- IN TERMS OF EQUIPMENT -- WEARING DOWN IN NEEDING TO BE REPLACED AT IN TERMS OF THOSE ENGINES AND THAT THERE THE THE BUDGET HAS TYPICALLY INCLUDED FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS.TO INCREASE CAL FIRES ABILITY TO REPLACE -- ENGINES AND AND OTHER MOBILE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT'S JUST WEARING OUT MORE QUICKLY I'M BECAUSE IT'S BEING USED MORE HEAVILY ON THAT NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET MAKES THAT THREE MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION PERMANENT. AN ON GOING -- THE KEEP IN MIND AND AGAIN THIS IS GOES TO YOUR EXPERTS THAT ARE SITTING THERE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- THESE THESE A FIRE ENGINES ARE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THE MAYBE WE HAVE BUDGETED -- FOR SO I'M HOPING THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION A TRUE CONVERSATION WITH THIS -- OUT HOW FAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDS WHAT THEY NEED -- THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF THOSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WHEN SAFE BUT I KNOW THAT THESE ARE NOT CHEAP AND I KNOW IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO ORDER THEM AND GET THEM BACK TO YOU IN A TIMELY FASHION SO. THAT'S THE WHAT'S ONE THING SOUTH AROUND FOR ME. THE OTHER ONE IS THAT -- ON LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION -- SO YOU'RE ASKING -- YES AND CAL FIRE TO DO AN ASSESSMENT ARE YOU'RE RECOMMENDING AN ASSESSMENT WOULD BE BE FUNDING ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR THEM TO DO SO -- BECAUSE OF TO ME THEY'RE STRETCHED WAY. TO SO -- I HATE MAKING PROMISES THAT WE CAN'T FILL AND PUTTING THEM IN A SITUATION OF MANDATING SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE MANDATE. SO. SURE AND YEAH SO OUR OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO TO YOU ALL TO CONSIDER REQUIRING THEM TO DO IT -- I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT CAUGHT FIRE AND YES INDICATE THAT THEY MIGHT NEED SOME RESOURCES TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE THEM ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CONTEXT OF PROVIDING A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR ANOTHER CLOSE TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND AND LIKELY ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS OF THAT SCALE. GOING FORWARD FOR THE FORESEEABLE HAVE THESE VERY SEVERE -- FIRE CONDITIONS AND HAVING IT BETTER INFORMATION TAKE GUIDE THOSE AUGMENTATIONS COULD HELP THE STATE TO SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN AND ENSURE THAT WHILE YOU DO HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND LIMITED CAPACITY TO MAKE THESE TYPES OF INCREASES. THAT IT'S REALLY GOING TO THE PLACES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE THE MOST BENEFITS. AND AND REALLY MEET THE HIGHEST PRIORITY NEEDS YEAH. IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT WE HAVE THE SHORT TERM. IDEAS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS LONG TERM THIS IS THIS IS IN KEEP GOING ON SO I JUST WANNA AT THE STRESS THAT. THE OTHER ONE IS TECHNOLOGY I AM ALL FOR TECHNOLOGY IS A MATTER OF FACT ON MY TIME OFF THIS PAST YEAR SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT THE TECHNOLOGY. SPENT SOMETIME SCRIPTS. TO WATCH WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED THAT -- WE COULD REALLY PRE POSITION PEOPLE WHERE EARLIER WHEN WE KNOW WHAT THE WIND IN THE ERRORS THE IT THE AIR SPEEDS ARE GOING ON THOUGH. THE WATER STREAMS -- BUT I DON'T WANT TO FORGET SOMETHING THE DUE TO SAID DIRECTOR DOES EVERYTHING. THE RIGHT AROUND COULD HAPPEN AND WE TALK ABOUT FIRES. AND THAT'S FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT COULD HAPPEN DURING -- THAT PERIOD OF TIME IF WE WERE TO HAVE EARTHQUAKES AND MAY BE ABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT AS WELL AND I'M SURE ALL OF YOU ARE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE YOU THE TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE. GOING TO DO THIS COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THIS LET'S NOT FORGET THE EARTHQUAKE ARE YOU KNOW -- AREN'T COULD HAPPEN WE HAVE MORE FLOODING ABOUT THE FIRES -- BUT WE JUST ARE FOCUSED RIGHT NOW ON THE FIRES WHICH A ARE REALLY WELL FIRST WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT. THEY'RE PART OF MY DISTRICT I DON'T WANT TO FORGET ABOUT MY FRIENDS IN THE BAY AREA AND ALONG THE COASTLINE. SO THANK YOU. THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO A CELL NUMBER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION RELATING TO YOUR TO MANNING ISSUES SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE HUMAN RESOURCES TO GO ALONG WITH. THE TECHNOLOGY SO -- ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO MAN THE HAND KERR'S ACROSS THE STATE AND I'M GONNA HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO MAN. THE AIR TANKERS -- I CRIED WITH WITH THE FOR SERVICE TO BE ABLE TO BATTLE SOME OF THESE FIRES I KNOW WE'VE HAD TO AT LEAST A FOR SERVICE HE SAID TO ME SHE'S WITH THAT IN THE PAST BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS -- AGAIN IT'S AT TO FISCAL ISSUE BUT IT GOES HAND IN HAND I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY IN BEING ABLE TO MONITOR -- WELL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND AND THE THE ANSWER ON HAND CRUZ IS WE'RE WE'RE VERY MUCH IN THE STATE SYSTEM -- RELYING ON OUR INMATE FIREFIGHTING HAND CREWS -- THOSE THOSE IN MAKE CREWS -- IT WE WITH THEY'VE SEEN A DWINDLING NUMBER. OF MEMBERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US AND SO WE'RE RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOWN ABOUT THIRTY CREWS -- BELOW WHAT ARE OUR CAPACITY IS -- SO OF COURSE THAT IS A CONCERN -- WE ARE -- BACK FILLING SOME OF THOSE -- A WITH ADDITIONAL OF SEE SEE SEE FIRE DATA CORRECT DEDICATED CREWS -- AND AND THEN THE OF ENTER A TRAINING CENTER -- IS IN ITS -- WHAT WE'RE CALLING SECOND COHORT PROGRAM TO BE FOR FIRE CREW AS WELL? OKAY JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT HOW MANY TRAINEES DO YOU ANTICIPATE RECEIVING OUT OF THAT SECOND COHORT BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU'RE DOWN THIRTY CREWS. RIGHT SO IT WOULD BE TO THEIR TWO CREWS THEY'RE CURRENTLY CAME TO CREWS WERE THE PEOPLE OKAY -- IT ONCE THAT. GIFT THAT PROGRAM CONTINUES AS AS IT'S IT'S FUNDED WE WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE FOR CREWS WORKING OUT OF THEIR PLUS THE THE CCC CREWS -- AND THEN WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH CDC ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING AS MANY POSSIBLE INMATES AS WE CAN INTO THE SYSTEM. TO REPOPULATE THE CAMPS THAT ARE -- THAT ARE. AT A DEFICIT FOR CREW MEMBERS CURRENTLY SO ALL OF THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON TO TO BRING UP THE CREW COUNTS -- AS FAR AS YOU CAN I'M GONNA MOVED AIRCRAFT -- SO FOR AIRCRAFT THE AIRCRAFT THAT WE HAVE TO FLY -- WE CONTINUE TO HIRE -- PILOTS AS WE NEED -- TO IT FOR REFERENCE THE HELICOPTER PILOTS -- FOR CAL FIRE OUR STATE CALIFORNIA AND LOUISE -- THE FIXED WING -- AIR TANKER PILOTS ARE ON A CONTRACT BASIS WITH DYINGCORPS AND SO DYNCORP. PROVIDES THOSE THOSE PILOTS TO FLY OUR PLANES -- AS WE MOVE INTO -- THE THE C. -- ONE THIRTY RR -- WE HAVE THAT LARGE AIR TANKERS -- PART OF WHAT'S IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET -- IS A PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE PILOTS HEAD OF GETTING THE AIRCRAFT THAT ARE HERE AND READY TO FLY SO. SO THE MINUTE WE HAVE THE AIRCRAFT -- THAT IS OUTFITTED AND READY TO DROP RETARDANT. THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY PUT THE PILOTS ON THAT AND FLY THOSE THOSE SHIPS WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A AN EXTENDED TRAINING PERIOD -- TO THAT WOULD KEEP THOSE FROM FLYING MISSIONS DURING THAT PERIOD. OKAY SO I HAVE TO FOLLOW UPS IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN -- LET'S GO WITH THE LAST THING WITH REAL RELATING TO THE AIR TANKERS -- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TRAINING YOU KNOW OUR OWN PERSONNEL BUT OR ARE YOU WE STILL CONTRACTING OUT. WITH THAT BECAUSE I KNOW FOR INSTANCE IN THE CITY THAT I LIVE IN LAKE ELSINORE WE HAVE MANY TIMES IN THE PAST YEAR SEEN THE BIG TANKER COMMAND. AND YOU KNOW PHILIP IN THE LAKE IN AND GO OUT THERE SO ARE WE STILL DOING THAT I BELIEVE ONE OF THE COMPANIES WAS EVEN BASED OUT OF CANADA I THINK. THAT WOULD BE -- SUPER SCOOPER STAMP -- AND THEY THEY FILL WITH WATER THEY DROP WATER LIKE HELICOPTERS DROP WATER NOT THE RED STUFF. THE WATER -- THAT IS NOT SO EIGHT DOES -- ON A ROUTINE BASIS WE DO ON OCCASION HIGHER -- THOSE THOSE THOSE TYPE OF AIR TANKERS -- LA COUNTY. DOES ANNUALLY AND THE FOREST SERVICE HAS BEEN ANNUALLY OKAY SO YOU GUYS TYPICALLY DON'T DO THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A COST BURDEN HERE JUST IT'S JUST NOT PARTY HERE. IT'S IT'S TYPICALLY ONE WHERE WHAT WHEN WHERE UTILIZING -- FIXED WING AIRCRAFT WE WANT RETARDANT ON THE GROUND THEY DON'T DROP RETARDANT. IS A OF A PERSISTENT LONG LASTING APPLICATION TO THE THE THE FUELS. WHERE WATER ONCE IT DISSIPATES COURSE IT'S WATER? OKAY AND THEN JUST TO FALL JUST AS A FINAL QUESTION A FOLLOW UP ON THE THE CRUISE. STONE WHEN YOU'RE DOWN THIRTY CRUZ I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOME -- PEOPLE BEING TRAINEDNOW THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S GOING TO PUT JANUARY NEAR WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ACT IDEALLY. SO. I STILL HAD THE LINGERING QUESTION OF HOW. IF YOU CAN AT ALL ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF PERSONNEL TO BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB YOU NEED TO DO THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND SOMETIMES. ON THAT MEANS MORE MONEY SOMETIMES IT MEANS A DIFFERENT STRATEGY BUT I'M JUST IF YOU COULD. ANSWER THAT IN THE BEST WAY THAT YOU CAN AT THIS POINT. HEY ANY AND IT. REMAINS A GREAT QUESTION AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD -- FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS -- START ARE IN MAY -- YEAH MEMBERS ON THOSE ON THOSE CREWS AND WE'RE HOVERING. AND SO -- THINGS HAVE NOT GOTTEN WORSE IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO BUT THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN A LOT BETTER EITHER SO -- WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS -- EVERY OPTION EXCEPT FOR AN INMATE IS VERY EXPENSIVE -- AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT -- POSSIBLE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. AND AND KIND OF JUST TO PIVOT THIS -- CONVERSATIONAL LITTLE BIT BACK TO THE GAP ANALYSIS -- CAL FIRES THE STRATEGIC PLAN -- I JUST SPENT THE LAST YEAR WORKING -- WITH CHEAP PIMLOTT AND OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM -- IN MY PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENT DEVELOPING THAT. AND THE FIRST GOAL IN THAT STRATEGIC PLAN STARTING THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOING FORWARD IS TO DO THAT GAP ANALYSIS. AND SO WE ARE LAUNCHING ON THAT -- AS WE SPEAK FORM BETTER HOW MUCH WE NEED WHERE WE NEED IT. AND THEN THE COST. AND WE'RE GONNA BRING IT. WE'LL LET YOU GO AHEAD AND CHECK MY MAIL QUICKLY JUST ON THE IN MAY -- PROGRAM CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXACTLY HOW -- THE INMATES ARE CHOSEN TO TRAINING AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAID. SO ARE ARE IN MAY PROGRAM -- A THE INMATES THAT ARE SELECTED THEIR SELECTED BY CDC ARE THEY HAVE TO MEET A SCREENING CRITERIA -- ONCE THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THAT SCREENING CRITERIA THEN THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT THROUGH A TRAINING PROGRAM AT ONE OF ONE OF OUR CAL FIRE IN MAY TRAINING PROGRAMS -- THEY GO THROUGH THAT -- AND LET'S JUST SAY THEY THAT THAT THEY MAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKES IT THROUGH -- THEN THEY GET DEPLOYED OUT TO ONE OF OUR CAMPS -- IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE. HOW MANY DEFICIT -- MEMBERS WE HAVE -- POTENTIALLY AND THEN ALSO -- MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SORTED APPROPRIATELY -- FOR SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE MIGHT HAVE MIXING -- TYPES OF IN ME -- AND SO -- ONCE SAID THERE THEN THEY ARE PAID -- AT THE SAME RATE THAT ALL OF CDC ARE IS PAID ON A DAILY BASIS. ANY ANY INMATE THAT'S IN A A PROGRAM -- IS PAID THE SAME AMOUNT. WHEN THEY GO ON FIRES? THEY ARE PAID AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT -- WE PAY -- IN ADDITION TO THEIR THEIR RATE THAT THEY GET FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING -- IN OTHER PROGRAMS THEY GET AN HOURLY RATE ON FIRES. JOINT DAILY RATE ON FIRES. BRING IT BACK TO OUR CHAIRMAN DOT [inaudible] YEAH -- HI I'M WONDERING DOES THE DATA I KNOW THAT -- WENT DOWN TO SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC TO SEE THEIR WEATHER MONITORING -- STATIONS AND ALL OTHER THREAT ASSESSMENT AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS WHICH WAS -- YOU KNOW PRETTY DARN IMPRESSIVE -- AND I KNOW THAT -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -- IS DOING THAT -- ALTHOUGH NOT AS ADVANCED IN P. GENIES ON AT THE TO OF FACILITIES THAT YOU HAVE DO YOU. SHARE IN THAT MONITORING -- THAT DATA. DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THAT DATA OR CAN YOU -- SHARE IN THAT DATA WHETHER IT'S CAMERAS WHETHER IT'S YEAH THREAT ASSESSMENTS AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS. I THANK YOU SO MUCH. I THINK SEVEN BUT THE CELL PHONES REALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SHARING OF RESOURCES WE HAVE. WE HAVE COMPANIES THAT ARE. YOU KNOW REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB MONITORING AND THEIR WATERSHEDS THEIR AREAS AND EVERYTHING AND INSTEAD OF RECREATING THE WHEEL PUTTING NEW CAMERAS NEW -- WHETHER MONITORING STATIONS ALL THESE PLACES I'D LIKE TO SEE -- WHAT WE CAN DO? TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL GUITAR CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING THOSE BILLS YEAH -- WE OUGHT TO HAVE THAT DATA AND USE THAT DATA A AND AND I CAN SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO SAN DIEGO -- HAVING BY A GUY COME FROM THERE AND I I WAS THERE WHEN THAT PROGRAM KIND OF LIST WAS DEVELOPING -- AND YES IT'S VERY INTEGRATED -- THE SAN DIEGO -- GAS AND ELECTRIC AS WELL AS THE THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND THE THE GAC WITH THE FOR SERVICE -- DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR AND CAL FIRE AND YES ALL INCLUDED IN THAT FROM RIVERSIDE -- AND AND YOU SEE WORKS THROUGH -- SOME OF THE NUANCES OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS WHETHER IT'S CAMERAS OR SHARING DATA ON THE FINE GRAIN WHETHER OR SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE PARTICULARLY SAN DIEGO BUT THEN ALSO MOVING INTO. TO ORANGE RIVERSIDE LOS ANGELES -- YOU COUNTIES FOR SURE BUILT THE AND THEN TOOLS LIKE -- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN OR BE AWARE OF THE SANTANA WILDFIRE THREAD INDEX IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT IS MANAGED OUT OF THE GAC BUT IT DRAWS ON ALL OF THAT FINE GRAIN WHETHER -- DATA -- TO TO DEVELOP THE THE SEVERITY AND THE TIMING THAT THAT THE THREAT INDEXES GOING. TO JUMP FROM ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER OR THEN THEN REDUCE AND THEN ALL OF THAT SAME DATA IS BEING USED AND SHARED. BACK -- TO SDG ANY IN THIS CASE -- TWO FOR FOR THE UTILITY TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH WITH -- PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE AS WELL. SO I'M NOT. GO AHEAD WELL I GUESS ONE OF THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I MAKE IT A PERFECT WORLD BOB AND THIS ONE OF THE THINGS WERE WERE TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS HIS IS LEVERAGING ALL OF THAT WE WE HAVE ACCESS. TO MANY OF THE CAMERA SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE THAT STORY ACCESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL UTILITIES. DATA THAT IS COMING FORWARD AND THAT IS. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS. TO YOU KNOW MUCH LIKE WE HAVE AND I GOT I MENTIONED BEFORE ARE DATA COMING IN FOR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT SOURCES THEN THEN THEN OF COURSE YOU NEED ANALYSTS TO BE ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND THE DATA THAT YOU'RE SEEING AND AND PUT IT IN THE ANALYTICS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE. THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT A LOT OF A LOT OF STUFF COMING IN SO -- BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO SOME THINGS WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THEM -- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO GET. TO THEM ONE FINAL QUESTION. IT OUT. IT'S AMAZING OVER THE LAST YEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT I'VE TALKED TO COME INTO MY OFFICE -- TO SHARE ON SOME INFORMATION THEY HAVE WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S A RETARDANT OR WHETHER IT'S A FIRST ALERT SYSTEM OR ITS. MONEY ALL MONITORING IT'S ALL VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE. IS THERE A CLEARING HOUSE THAT WE'VE GOT IN THIS STATE THAT WE COULD. SAID THAT TOO BECAUSE WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT -- I'M NOT SURE. THAT WE NEED TO BE WOULD BE HEARING ABOUT IT BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE SOME PLACE TO GO IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING GOOD. THEY CAN HELP -- PUT THESE FIRES OUT QUICK ALERTS FIRST MODERATE ALL THOSE TYPE OF THING. BOB THAT MAYBE YOU THEY HAVE THAT SO. I WANT TO CIRCUMVENT ME INCOME RIGHT. THANK YOU OKAY. BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU'RE THE ONE THAT LOOK AT YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES ARE ON THE GROUND. THE NO ONE UNDERSTAND THIS STUFF AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE AVAILABLE AND HAVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES. TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ON THE MARKET AND MOVE ON IT -- IF IF NEED BE. HI YEAH AND I I AGREE AND WE DO HAVE AN OPEN -- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAM THAT HAS -- CHIEF OFFICER THAT REVIEWS EVERY EVERYONE OF THESE CONCEPTS THAT'S COME THAT COMES INTO OUR OFFICE. AND WE CROSS REFERENCE THAT AND CATEGORIZE IT WITH WITH OTHERS AND THEN -- SEND LETTERS BACK DEPENDING ON WHAT. SIT SOME OF THEM COME AS A CONCEPT WITHOUT AN WITHOUT ENOUGH DATA TO BE ABLE -- TO REALLY ASSESS WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE DOING OR ASSESS WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT AND FOR THAT INFORMATION -- IN A LOT OF CASES THEY'RE UNABLE TO COME BACK WITH THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS A SCREENING TOOL FOR US BUT WE STILL KEEP THOSE THOSE IDEAS IN THE IN THE HOPPER. AND WE PERIODICALLY COMPANY SCREEN THROUGH THOSE AND LOOK -- FOR WE AWARE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME AGGREGATION OF OF OF IDEAS THAT MIGHT HAVE A A PLACE THANK YOU -- SURCHARGE LETTER. FIRST OFF LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THANK YOU CHIEF TO ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM FIREFIGHTERS FIRST RESPONDERS. AND ALL THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SHOULD MISSPELLING THESE THAT WORK WITH YOU AND AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND MY CONDOLENCES TO ALL THE FAMILIES THAT -- LOSS -- OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THERE WERE SO DEVASTATED BECAUSE OF THE FIRES. I'D LIKE TO MENTION THE THE FACT THAT EXACT IN NOVEMBER WE HAD ONE OF THE DEADLIEST -- DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA WITH EIGHTY FIVE DEATHS AND A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE STRUCTURES. AND IN ALSO IN JUNE WE HAD -- ONE OF THE LARGEST AGAIN MENDOCINO. COUNTY THAT LOS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRES. AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS BECAUSE WE HAVE ELEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO LIVE WITHIN THE WILDLAND. URBAN INTERFACE AND SO THAT TELLS ME THAT WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING. RIGHT HERE BECAUSE 95% OF THE FIRES THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE MAN MADE MAN CAUSED AND YOU KNOW SUCH THINGS AS THE LAWN MORE DURABLE -- BUT WHETHER BE TARGET PRACTICE FIRE [inaudible] CAMPFIRE MIGHT BE. BUT I THINK WE'RE WHAT I'M NOT HEARING IS A PROGRAM TO GET TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER A GREAT PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAM. YOU KNOW ASKING FOR A FEW MILLION DOLLARS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS PUBLIC RELATIONS SOMEWHERE JUST BLASTED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHEN IT'S FIRE SEASON ALL OF US HAVE GOT TO PARTICIPATE? WHEN YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD LOVE TO PICK UP THAT PHONE TO BE YOUR EYES AND EARS -- BUT WE'VE GOT TO TELL THEM THAT IT'S US. OFF THE HUMAN BEANS 95% OF THE ONCE BECAUSE HE'S FIRED WE GOT TO BE AWARE OF IT SOUL. OF FIRE PREVENTION I THINK IS THE KEY BUT THE PLEASE ALL SUPPORT ANYTHING YOU BRING BEFORE ME. IN AND I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES ARE THE SAME WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT PUBLIC RELATIONS AND PUBLIC AWARENESS. BECAUSE THEIR LIVES OUT THERE WE'VE GOT A SHAPE OUR OUR OUR FORESTS THAT ARE SO PRECIOUS OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SOMEONE. BUT OBVIOUSLY NOTHING MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE HUMAN LIFE ITSELF. SO I'D LIKE -- TO ASK YOU PUT YOUR TEAM TOGETHER NATION'S PROGRAM NEXT TIME AND I SHOULD [inaudible] YOUR COMMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU COMMENTS AND AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT THAT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION -- IS IS PARAMOUNT TO OUR SUCCESS IN MOVING FORWARD -- AB THE PEOPLE OF OR PLAY OR WORK OR TRAVEL THROUGH FIRE COUNTRY. ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS AND EVERYBODY CAN BE AFFECTED IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE. IN THE STATE WILDFIRE AFFECTS YOU. AND THAT MESSAGE -- IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE ARE ARE WORKING ON A CAMPAIGN TO DO MORE OF AND MORE -- METHODICALLY -- IN AREAS THAT WE HAVEN'T BEFORE -- AND SO I AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT AND LET ME SEE WHERE MY PEOPLE ARE AND AND WILL CONTINUE. TO WORK DOWN THE STREET BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE TEAMS YOU PUT TOGETHER THE MEN WOMEN OTHER WORKING FIGHTING THESE FIRES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT. THAT YOU HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO HAVE THAT MISSING ELEMENT IS THE HUMAN. TO GO GO AND BE PART OF IT IN. SHOULD KNOW HOW TO PREVENT A FIRE AND BE ABLE TO TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR FIREFIGHTERS. AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU. BRING IT BACK -- TO BACK TO THE CHAIR HERE I'VE GOT. A COUPLE QUESTIONS COME UP JUST LISTEN TO THE THE CONVERSATION TESTIMONY -- ONE I RECALL PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS -- IN PAST YEARS ABOUT -- BOTH HELICOPTERS AND PLANES AND THE ABILITY TO DROP. AT NIGHT -- AND SOME LIMITATIONS THERE AND I HEARD EARLIER DISCUSSION I THINK WAS A CENTER SO -- ADDRESSING SOME NEW EQUIPMENT SOME HELICOPTERS. DOES THAT ADDRESS THOSE -- PREVIOUS LIMITATIONS -- IT DOES SO THE NEW HELICOPTERS THAT ARE COMING UP FOR CALIFORNIA -- WILL HAVE NIGHT BUYING CAPABILITY -- AND SO AS IT STANDS WE ARE STILL -- IN A STANCE OF HELICOPTERS OF THE ONLY THING WE USE AT NIGHT FOR DROPPING -- MATERIALS FROM THEM WE USE OTHER AERIAL -- SURVEILLANCE AND AND FOR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS BUT THE ONLY TOOLS THAT WERE USING AT NIGHT FOR DROPPING WATER OR RETARDANT ARE ARE FROM. HELICOPTERS I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR -- WELL THERE IS RESEARCH AND THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE LOOKING AT FIXED WING -- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE. CURRENTLY EQUIPPED TO DO -- NOR -- THE DO WE HAVE A NEAR TERM PLAN TO DO THAT. WITH THE CAL FIRE FLEET. HOW EFFECTIVE -- OR IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN FCP AS IT RELATES TO DROPPING IN DIAPERS IS DROPPING DURING THE DAY. SPENT TIME ON FIRES WE'RE WE'RE BOTH HAVE OCCURRED -- NIGHT AND AND DAY -- WHAT? WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU LOOK AT FOR USE OF OF -- DROPPING OF WATER AT NIGHT -- LIFE SAFETY -- IF YOU ARE IN A ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU'RE IN THIS KIND OF A CITY TYPE OF A SITUATION OR CLOSE -- TO LET'S JUST SAY A SCREWBALL WHICH WAS A FIRE THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN DROP WATER -- AND WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S HAVING AN EFFECT -- THAT'S HELPFUL. IF YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE DIRECTLY SUPPORTING -- TROOPS ON THE GROUND OR TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S HELPFUL. IF YOU'RE JUST DROPPING WATER OUT ON FIRE LINE SOMEWHERE ON A HILLSIDE -- AND THERE'S NO GROUND RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH IT -- THERE IS THERE IT WILL SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF THE FIRE A LITTLE BIT. BUT FIRE STILL GOING TO BE THERE IN THE MORNING. AND IT'S NOT PUTTING FIRE OUT SO SO THE THE IT'S IT'S A TACTICAL TOOL AND IT REALLY FOR US IS SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT A LIFE SAFETY OR MEDIA -- PROPERTY OF PROTECTION KIND OF A MEASURE. AND WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE RIGHT THERE ON THE GROUND TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT THEY NEED TO ON THE GROUND ONCE THE DROP. THE DRUDGE STATE YOU CORRECTED THE DIVISIONAL. QUICKLY COMING ONLINE. WILL INCREASE OUR ABILITIES THIS AREA. CORRECT IT WILL INCREASE OUR ABILITIES TO DO THAT FROM THE CAL FIRE PERSPECTIVE WE ALREADY HAVE PARTNERS THAT HAVE THAT CAPABILITY AND WE UTILIZE THAT CAPABILITY WHEN THOSE SHIPS ARE AVAILABLE. AND THEY HAVE SEEN THE THE THE MISSION DURING THE DAY AND ARE ABLE TO FLY THAT. AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION AND EITHER OF THE DIRECTORS MIGHT TAKE THIS IS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL I THINK WAS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS? IN THE BUDGET -- FOR CAN SOMEBODY PUT THAT IN CONTEXT FOR ME YOU KNOW WHAT'S OUR CAPABILITY NOW WHAT IS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GET US WHAT IS A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS GET US WHAT IS THE WHAT YOU KNOW IN A PERFECT WORLD HOW MANY CAMERAS MIGHT WE HAVE. IT IS THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION -- I I CAN'T TALK TO THE PERFECT WORLD -- I CAN TALK TO WE'VE ALL BEEN TRYING. WHAT I CAN TALK TO IS -- WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FIVE CAMERAS THAT WE CURRENTLY UTILIZE -- AND SO. WE MOST OF THOSE ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE HIGHEST SATURATION IS IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEN AS YOU AS YOU MOVE NORTH GETS LESS. MORE AROUND SOME OF THE PUBLIC POPULATED AREAS LESS WHEN YOU GET OUT INTO THE THE MORE REMOTE LANDSCAPE. WE THIS HUNDRED CAMERAS BECAUSE THAT THE FOR THAT FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS POINTS -- TO HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CAMERAS -- AND SO THAT WILL MORE THE NUMBER OF CAMERAS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AND SPREAD THEM ACROSS THE REST OF THE STATE WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH -- I CANNOT SAY WE'LL HAVE TO DEPLOY IT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN DEPLOY. AND WE HAVE LOCATIONS TO DEPLOY WITHOUT. BUILDING NEW -- SITES TO DEPLOY THEM. OKAY THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS -- CENTER BRADFORD THEM CLOSER GALGIANI SHOULD QUICK QUESTION ARE JUST ONE IN A WITH THE CDC OUR RADIUS. I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK IT HAS CHANGED RECENTLY -- IT IS IT IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY. IT'S TWO DOLLARS. A DAY. AND THEN WE PAY -- ON FIRES ADDITIONAL TO THAT. SO WE'VE WAITED. WHAT IS YOUR RATE FOR THE FIRE -- AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REASSESSING THAT AND AND IT'S CHANGING -- CAN I GET CAN I GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT [inaudible] ONE SIR GALGIANI. I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT I AM VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE THAT THE REQUEST FROM THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES MONEY FOR THE CAMERAS. I MET LAST YEAR WITH -- I BELIEVE IT WAS CAN'T GRAHAM THAT GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS MY USED TO WORK FOR INTRODUCED ME TO AND HE SHOWED ME -- HOW THE CAMERAS WORK ON HIS LAPTOP IN AND WALKED ME THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THE FACT THAT -- I GUESS IT'S SAN DIEGO GAS AND AND I THINK THAT. ANY ADDITIONAL TOOLS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE YOU -- WE OUGHT TO DOEVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENED SO I'M REALLY REALLY PLEASED THAT. THAT WE ARE GOING IN THE DRESS THAT DIRECTION AND WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN'T IT SUPPORT THAT. OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS BY THE MEMBERS. I'LL CONCLUDE BY ASKING THE JUDGE IF YOU GUYS COULD GET US BY THE COMMITTEE WITH SOME. FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE CAMERAS WHAT COVERAGE AREAS -- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK REMEMBERS. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- IN YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT THIS TIME MEMBERS WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM THREE ON THE AGENDA. HOW CURRENT AND FUTURE TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED TO MITIGATE FUTURE WHILE FOR DAMAGE WITH ASKED A NUMBER OF EXPERTS? FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S. THE STATE RATHER -- TO PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY ON RESEARCH PROJECTS AND INFORMATION ON THESE NEW TOOLS. TO MITIGATE SO WE WOULD WELCOME DOCTOR DEAL DRESS SCHOOL -- PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS AT UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO -- CRAIG CLEMENTS PHD SOCIAL PROFESSOR FIRE WITH THE RESEARCH LABORATORY SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY [inaudible] AND WE HAVE DOCTOR -- ALTERNATIVES PHD CHIEF DATA SCIENCE OFFICER SAN DIEGO SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER. AND LOOKS LIKE DOCTORS ALREADY -- WITH THE FIRE RESEARCH GROUP DEPARTMENT AT THE INTEREST CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AS WELL AS CHIEF -- FANTASY FROM GEORGE COVER FIRE THREE SO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE AND YOUR PRESENTATION WILL GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH A DOCTOR JUST CALLED. CHAIRMAN DOT THE DOG THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY COMMITTEE OF PULLING THIS TOGETHER -- WE HAD A DEVASTATING YEAR IN CALIFORNIA HERE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WOULD LIKE TO USE ALL THESE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES AT OUR DISPOSAL TO NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. SO HERE THE WAY WERE SEQUENCING SOME OF THIS TODAY IS WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT SENSORS FIRST. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT MODELING. A I AND ALSO -- SO OFF WE GO SO HERE. ALERT WILD FIRE -- GRAHAM CAN KEN SMITH -- MYSELF ALSO DUG TO ME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON WE'RE ALL SEISMOLOGIST WE STUDY EARTHQUAKES. SO YOU MUST BE ASKING YOURSELF HOW DO WE GET IN THE FIRE CAMERA BUSINESS. AND THE REASON WE DID AS WERE BUILDING LARGE DATA COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS. IN IN THE WORLD AREAS AND WE'RE BRINGING THAT INFORMATION BACK ON A RESILIENT MICROWAVE PLATFORM. OKAY SO WE'VE BEEN BUILDING THESE NETWORKS FOR EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING. AND IT WAS GRAHAM KENT'S VISION THAT WE SHOULD PUT FIRE CAMERAS ON THESE AND MAKE THE MULTI HAZARD. I SHARE THAT VISION. SO HERE -- SORRY -- CHAIRMAN GRAY STEPPED UP BECAUSE THIS ANSWERED HIS QUESTION ABOUT WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE. AND HERE. THIS IS A UNIVERSITY CONSORTIUM BETWEEN UNIVERSITY NEVADA RENO UC SAN DIEGO AND THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON. IT WAS ESTABLISHED VERSES I TOLD YOU -- WORK TAHOE BOB GRAHAM CAN -- STARTED THESE THIS OFF WITH THE FIRE CAMERAS. THERE'S A HUNDRED TWENTY CAMERAS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THAT ARE OPERATING -- PROJECTED CAMERAS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN OR TWO TO THREE HUNDRED MORE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL GIVE US GREAT COVERAGE WHEN THE WIND BLOWS. FIRES YEAR ROUND WE HAVE FIRE AND WE HAVE FIRE WHEN THE WIND BLOWS. OKAY SO HERE. LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE UTILITIES THEIR VISION SO CALIFORNIA UTILITY SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC HAVE ALL PLAYED A BIG ROLE IN THIS ROLL OUT OF CAMERAS AND IN FACT SINCE DECEMBER. WITH ROLLED OUT EIGHTY FIVE NEW CAMERAS. KAY AND THEY'RE ALL ACCESSIBLE TO THE WILD FIRE DOT ORG WERE YOU CAN ZOOM YOU CAN TIME LAPSE YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE FIRE IS WITH RESPECT TO YOU YOU CAN TRIANGULATE. SO THIS TOOL IS NOT JUST FOR THE FIRST RESPONDER IT'S FOR THE PUBLIC IT'S FOR CALIFORNIANS GREATER JACK TO QUICK QUESTION YES. DE THESE CAMERAS INCLUDE THE CAMERAS THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT WE S. OKAY YES. KAY AND THEY'RE ACCEPTABLE WORK AND I'LL CALL OUT LATER IN THE STOCK BUT WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH ORANGE COUNTY. WITH MORAN WITH NAPA WAS CINEMA ALL OF THESE COUNTIES OF COMMON LINE AND THEY SHARE TOWERS AND WE SHARE TECHNOLOGY AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO LIVE YOU AND DRIVE THE CAMERAS. OKAY THESE CAMERAS THERE NOT. THE END ALL BUT THERE ANOTHER TOOL WE NEED EVERY TOOL. SO WE'RE WE'RE REALLY IN THE BUSINESS OF MULTI HAZARDS QUE. SO HERE THE ALERT WILDFIRE NETWORK EMPLOYEES THESE HIGH DEFINITION PAN TILT ZOOM AXIS CAMERAS. THEY HAVE NEAR INFRARED SO WE CAN DETECT FIRE AT NIGHT. MICROWAVE COMMUNICATION IS OUR BACKBONE THIS IS WAS A AND IT WON'T GO DOWN IF ONE OF OUR TOWERS BURNS OVER WILL RE PATH. THE SIGNAL OUT THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMETIMES MORE STATIONS IN CERTAIN AREAS SO WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION BACK IF WE CAN'T BE UP DURING A DISASTER. IT'S NOT A A GOOD SYSTEM. SO HERE. PROVIDES UNPARALLELED RESOLUTION SO WE'RE NOT AN EARLY TO TAPPED WERE A NINE ONE ONE CONFIRMATION AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW THAT WORKS. NINE ONE ONE BEACH A HIGH. SO. WE GET THE CALL. PEOPLE THE COMMAND CENTERS LIKE CORE ACOSTA MONTA VISTA OR BEND NICHOLS UP AND SAYING HOW LLENA. THE THEY LOOK AND THEY SAY I GOT A CALL OF A REPORT OF A FIRE IN PINE MOUNTAIN. THEY USE THE CAMERA THEY DON'T SEE IT THERE THEY MOVE OVER AND LOOK ON THE NEXT MOUNTAIN RANGE LIKE AND GEYSER PEAK. THEY FIND THE FIRE AND THEN THEY CAN DISPATCH ACCORDINGLY AND SCALE UP OR DOWN [inaudible] SO HERE. I WANT TO BRING THIS UP EARLY BECAUSE THESE FIRES ARE HUGE IMAGES OF CO. TWO ONE AVERAGE SIZE FIRE. A RACES ALL THE GAINS OF CAP AND TRADE FOR A WHOLE YEAR SO LET'S LOOK AT THIS CHART. CAN I GET YOU TO SCOOT OVER GET SOMETHING OUT OF A SORE NECK BY THE TIME I'M DONE HERE TALKING TO THIS. SO HERE THIS HERE IS MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO EQUIVALENT. LAST YEAR WE HAVE DATA IS TWENTY TRADE WE REDUCED OUR CARBON EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS CARS SO ONE BY ONE HALF MILLION METRIC TONS. HERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ROUGH FIRE. THE ROUGH FIRE THAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OMITTED ABOUT EIGHT MILLION TONS OF CO. TWO THAT ONE FIRE. ERASED ALL CAP AND TRADE. WE LOOK AT TWENTY THIRTEEN WE DID REALLY WELL IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ALMOST A REDUCTION OF FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS. BUT HERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIM FIRE. THE RIM FIRE NEAR YOU SOMEBODY THAT RIMFIRE WAS HUGE AND ADMITTED ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARMEN. THESE ESTIMATES OF FROM THE FOREST SERVICE THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AND ARGUMENTS ABOUT HOW PRECISE THEY ARE. BUT WE NEED TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE THINK OF CO TWO AND OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. IS BEING A GEOLOGIST YOU HAVE TO DO TIME YOU KNOW DEEP TIME. SO HERE WE ARE WE'RE LOOKING BACK FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS OKAY THESE ARE GLACIAL CYCLES INTERGLACIAL GLACIAL INTERGLACIAL GLACIAL. LOOK WHERE WE ARE HERE WORK FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN PARTS PER MILLION ROGER REVELLE WHO FOUNDED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. SAID THIS WE ARE CAN. AND I ADD TO THAT. WE'RE IN IT. WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THIS EXPERIMENT. OKAY BECAUSE WE'RE IN A TIME. OF EXTREME CLIMATE. WE WOULD CALL IT OUR GROUP WOULD COLLEGE WEATHER WHIPLASH. OKAY [inaudible] SO HERE. JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THE ADVANTAGES OF LARGE WILDFIRE. WE HAVE RAPID NINE ONE ONE CALL CONFIRMATION. IT ALLOWS DISPATCHERS TO SCALE THEIR RESOURCES. THEY HAVE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS THEY CAN SEE THIS ON THEIR TABLET WHEN THEY DRIVE TO THE FIRES HOW IT'S CHANGING IN REAL TIME. OKAY DURING EXPLOSIVE FIRE BEHAVIOR WE'RE WE'RE JUST SEQUENCING EVACUATIONS AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE SAFE AS POSSIBLE THOSE FIRES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE JUST EXPLODE IN THAT INCIPIENT. FIRE -- MODE -- TIME AND AFTER CONTAINMENT. RECONDITION THE HOLY FIRE IN ELSINORE REIGNITED ALMOST IN THE SAME PLACE A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE INITIAL BURN. QUE AND WE WERE ABLE TO CATCH IT EARLY ON THESE CAMERAS. SO THIS YEAR'S THE WALL FIRE WE REPURPOSE THE OROVILLE DAM WERE ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM THE WALL FIRE. LOOK AT THIS TORRENT ATTIC ACTIVITY IN FRONT OF THE FIRE. THE CAR FIRE HAD TORN ATTIC ACTIVITY A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. THAT'S IT EF THREE THAT'S LIKE THE TORNADOES THAT JUST RIPPED THROUGH YOU KNOW GEORGIA AND ALABAMA IT TAKES HOUSES OFF THEIR PLATFORMS IT MOVES CARS. CASE OF THIS IS ANOTHER THING AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT DID IT GOT THE ASHES UP ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FEET INTO THE TROPOSPHERE. AND THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WAS NO FIRE BREAK QUE IT WENT RIGHT ACROSS CASE OF THIS THIS TORN ATTIC ACTIVITY WE'RE STARTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DYNAMICS THE ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS OF FIRE. OKAY SO HERE THIS SITUATION AWARENESS THIS IS THE PERRY FIRE IN NORTHEAST RENO. WE'RE ABLE TO SEE HOW WATER DROPS AND RETARDED OR WORKING WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM BACK TO THE PILOTS TO DISPATCH YES THIS IS THIS IS WORKING THESE. DROPS AND I'LL SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM THE HOLY FIRE. UC SAN DIEGO'S ALL IN OUR CHANCELLOR UNDERSTANDING IN PROTECTING THE PLANET'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST GOALS. AND IT'S THROUGH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE TO USE EVERYTHING. IT'S NOT ONE OR THE OTHER THERE'S NO PANACEA HERE WE HAVE TO WE'RE ALL IN WE HAVE TO GO ALL IN. SO HERE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE THIS IS DOLLAR POINT LAKE TAHOE BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE IN THE BACKGROUND. WE USE AXIS SIXTY FIFTY FIVE EACH CAMERAS HIGH DEFINITION YOU CAN SEE THE CAMERA RIGHT THERE WE HAVE A MICROWAVE DISH OPERATING AT FOUR POINT NINE GIGAHERTZ. THIS IS A COMBINED FIRE AND EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING SO WE HAVE A STRONG MOTION SENSOR ON WERE COLLABORATING WITH CALLOW YES TO PUT SOME OF THESE STRONG MOTION SENSORS ON OUR TOWERS WERE WE HAVE BACK CALL. AND WE CAN PROVIDE INSTANT -- DATA ON EARTHQUAKES. SO HERE -- UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN THIS. THEY DEVELOP THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SO YOU CAN REMOTELY CONTROL THE CAMERA'S QUE YOU CAN PAN TILT ZOOM FROM YOUR DISPATCH. YOU CAN SEARCH FOR FIRES GAY AND EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THEY GO DOWN THIS WAS -- TREAT I GOT TO GO UP THE BUCKSKIN MOUNT AND FEET. AND THE ONLY THING THE GUYS FROM YOU IN OUR SAID IS HE'S IN SHORTS WELL I'M A CALIFORNIAN. I WANTED TO WEAR SHORTS TODAY BUT I GOT TOLD NOW. SO HERE. THIS IS THIS IS BUT TELL LAKE HERE I WANT TO SHOW YOU SO PATEL LAKES ABOUT FIVE KILOMETERS AWAY. WHEN WE ZOOM IN THAT'S THE KIND OF RESOLUTION WE CAN GET FROM LIKE FIVE MILES AWAY? SO WE CAN PAN TILT ZOOM WHEN WE HAVE A NINE ONE ONE CALL AND SEE WHERE THE FIRE MIGHT BE OKAY. WE CAN ALSO TIME LAPSE SO WE CAN GO BACK THROUGH TIME BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES DUST LOOKS LIKE FIRE. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE YOU KNOW MARINE LAYER THINGS LIKE THIS YOU WANT TO SEE THEM TIME LAPSE BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IF IT REALLY IS FIRE VERSUS SOME OTHER PHENOMENA. THEY ALSO HAVE NEAR INFRARED SO WE CAN SEE FIRES AT NIGHT WE CAN TRY ANNUALLY THIS WAS AN ROSE LEGAL SO WE COULD SEE. THE FIRE DOWN IN MEXICO SO HERE THE NEAR INFRARED PROVIDES YOU KNOW DETECTION CONFIRMATION AT NIGHT. WE ALSO HAVE A BANNER THAT'S ON THESE CAMERAS I JUST A LARGE AT THIS IS CALIFORNIA MONTA VISTA UNIT. CORY ACOSTA WHO'S ON THE CAMERAS ALMOST ALL THE TIME. AND WE HAVE A ADVOCATE SO WE KNOW WHO'S ON THE CAMERAS IF IT'S CAL FIRE WE DON'T MOVE THE CAMERAS. OKAY SO HERE THERE'S AN ETIQUETTE THAT'S BEEN BUILT BETWEEN THE COUNTIES CAL FIRE OUR SELVES IN THE UTILITIES OF WHO MOVES THE CAMERAS. SO HERE THIS IS THE Y. LACK FIRE THIRTY FIVE SECONDS AFTER THE NINE ONE ONE CALL WE DETECTED IT. YOU CAN SEE IT HERE WE'RE LOOKING TO THE SOUTH GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME MOVIES HERE SO YOU'RE GONNA SEE SOME DUST IN THIS FRAME. THATCOULD BE -- MISINTERPRETED AS FIRE ALL UP A LITTLE BIT THERE VERY WINDY CONDITIONS THIS WAS A PURPLE FLAG WARNING THE ONLY ONE I'VE EVER SEEN. PURPLE FLAG HIGH WINDS LOW HUMIDITY AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE FIRE. IT'S KIND OF SLOW ON THIS -- PC BUT HERE THE FIRE IS GOING TO START RIGHT IN THIS AREA. AND IF I CAN GET IT. LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET IT. NO I'M GONNA GO BACK ONE MORE TIME AND SEE IF -- WE WERE WE WERE WARNED THAT SOMETIMES VIDEOS DON'T PLAY WELL ON THIS AND I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BETTER LUCK ON SOME OF THEIR VIDEOS EVER. IT'S GOING THERE YEAH. SO YOU CAN SEE THE ANTENNA. YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE DUST HERE SO THIS IS AN ENLARGEMENT OF THIS CAMERA HERE. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO THE NORTH HERE WE'RE LOOKING TO THE SOUTH. AND SO WE CAN -- IT REALLY ZOOM IN ON THESE FIRES AND UNDERSTAND THAT AND THIS EARLY DETECTION I'M GONNA NOT PLAY THIS WHOLE VIDEO. TO SAVE SOME TIME FOR THE OTHER MY COLLEAGUES BUT HERE. CHIEF MEACHUM WAS ABLE TO USE -- REPORTED IN. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE THE EIGHT AND HE WAS ABLE TO USE THE CAMERAS AND DETERMINE IT WAS IN MEXICO SO WAS RESPONSE WAS DIFFERENT. THAN IF IT HAD BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES IT ALSO GAVE HIM YOU KNOW ON A FASTER RESPONSE TIME OKAY. SO HERE ON THAT PURPLE FLAG WARNING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY GIGABITS OF EMERGY WAS DOWNLOADED AND WE'RE DOWNLOADING TWENTY TERABYTES OF TRAFFIC MONTHLY TODAY. ALL RIGHT SO THE SYSTEM DOESN'T GO DOWN WE UPLOAD IT TO THE WEB THE CLOUD. AND PEOPLE CAN ACCESS IT AND IT'S BEEN RESILIENT. THIS IS MY CALL OUT -- TO SAY HOW AWESOME IT IS TO SEE THE UTILITIES ORANGE COUNTY. OKAY -- DIVISION CHIEF BRIAN -- NORTON CHIEF BRIAN FANTASY -- COLLABORATING WITH THE UTILITIES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND THE UNIVERSITY AND IT'S THIS KIND OF COLLABORATION THAT'S REALLY PAYING OFF SO THIS IS MY CALL OUT THAT THIS IS A REALLY GREAT. ACADEMIC PRIVATE SECTOR COLLABORATION. THIS HERE IS A FIRE FROM RAMONA SO THIS HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER VETERANS DAY RED FLAG WARNING. THERE'S THE HELICOPTER THE SKY CRANE FROM -- SDG ANY WAS CALLED IN THEY SUPPRESS THE FIRE IN RED FLAG WARNING IN AN HOUR. OKAY IN -- THREE AND SEVEN WHAT -- FIRE CHIEF JOKER WOULD CALL THE PACIFIC FIRE BREAK OKAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN THEY WERE ON IT LET'S JUST WATCH THIS AGAIN REAL QUICK BECAUSE YOU GOT IT FOCUS. YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE HELICOPTERS COME IN RIGHT THROUGH HERE. KATETHERE IT IS DUMPING THE WATER ON IT AND THEY DUMPED ALMOST TEN THOUSAND GALLONS OF WATER IN THIS FIRE THERE WAS NO SPAWNING. AND THEY PUT IT OUT THIS IS THE INCIPIENT FIRE. ALL FIRES START SMALL. IT'S HOW WE GET TO THEM AND NEW TECHNOLOGY SHOULD AFFORD US OPPORTUNITIES TO GET TO THEM. SO HERE JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT WITH GOT CAMERAS NOW UP IN -- NORTH BAY. SO HERE THESE CAMERAS OF BEING -- PUT IN WE HAVE FIFTEEN ALREADY ANOTHER CAMERA JUST ONE UP TODAY OUR CREW INSTALLED IT AT PLACERVILLE. SO EIGHTY FIVE CAMERAS SENSE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER -- THIS HERE IS THE COYOTE FIRE IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED OVER HERE ON PINE MOUNTAIN -- SHANNON CHRIS AT THE SAME ELENA DISPATCH. JUMPED OVER TO GEYSER PEAK AND FOUND THAT THE NINE ONE ONE CALLER GAVE MISINFORMATION WHERE THE FIRE WAS AND IT'S IT'S HARD WHEN YOU'RE FAR AWAY TO KNOW WHAT'S RICH WINE IT'S COMING FROM OKAY. SO HERE -- NINE ONE ONE CONFIRMATION AND THEY WERE ABLE THEN TO DISPATCH -- ENGINES TO THIS FIRE OKAY. SO HERE WE'RE SEEING ABOUT TEN MILES FIFTEEN MILES FROM OUT TELL PIOUS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE SAN FRANCISCO. THESE CAMERAS HAVE GREAT RESOLUTION. THE PITCHER I LIKE TO SEE ON THE CAMERA MOST IS RAIN. OKAY THAT'S MY FAVORITE PICTURE RIGHT THERE WHEN I SEE RAIN I'M REALLY HAPPY. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS WEATHER WHIPLASH IS THE RAINS BRING FLOODS AND THEY BRING NEW GROWTH AND THEN WE'RE RIGHT BACK IN THE HEAT OF IT WHEN THE WIND STARTS BLOWING SO. HERE -- PARADISE FIRE THIS JUST IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS INCIPIENT FIRE BEHAVIOR. YOUR WERE TREATING AND EVACUATING. K. -- NINE JUST THIS IS THAT THIS INCIPIENT FIRE PHASE WE REALLY NEED TO BE ON THE FLYER AT THAT TIME. WE CALLED CASCADING DISASTERS YOU LOOK HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AIR QUALITY WAS TERRIBLE. HERE IN THE STATE I FLEW IN THIS IS MY PICTURE. COMING IN ON THE END OF THE THE FILTER OF POLLUTION IS SO HIGH YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE SUN'S CORONA. OKAY THIS AIR QUALITY IS IS HUGE FOR ONE RELATED DISEASES THE EMERGENCY ROOMS PEAKED ABOUT THREE MONTHS AFTER THE CAMP FIRE FROM ASTHMATICS AND AND PEOPLE WITH HEART RELATED DISEASES. OKAY IT JUST THESE THIS THE SAYS CASCADING DISASTERS TO IT. GAINES SO THIS IS THE HOLY FIRE -- IF -- DIVISION CHIEF BRYAN NORTON HAS A CHANCE TO TALK TO THIS. HIM AND TORY WOMEN WERE CONTROLLING THE CAMERAS IN REAL TIME HERE'S THE RETARDANT HERE'S THE V. Là COMING IN AND MAKING ANOTHER DOM -- THEY WERE ABLE -- TO KEEP THIS INFRASTRUCTURE ON SAN DIEGO PEAK SAY FROM THE FIRE SO IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF REAL TIME -- ATTACKING THIS FIRE IN THIS IN INCIPIENT FIRE PHASE. SO THIS YEAR'S A MOVIE I HOPE THIS ONE PLACE. IT'S JUST REALLY SLOW -- SO THIS SHOWS THE FIRE AND WHERE WERE WATCHING IT BRIAN'S CONTROLLING THE CAMERA RIGHT NOW. AND THE FIRES MOVING UP -- GETTING READY TO BURN OVER. AND AT THIS TIME I WAS TALKING TO EDISON AND TORY WITH MEN -- CALLED IN THIS FIRE -- FOR A DUMB FOR VIEW LOT. AND WE'RE ABLE TO SAY THIS INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE HAD THIS. CAMERA SYSTEM TO GIVE US SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. SO HERE LOOKING AT THE WOLSELEY FIRE WE HAD JUST PUT UP CAMERAS AT MOUNT WILSON SO WE SAW THEM AT NIGHT WE ALSO SAW THEM FROM OUR SITE THAT WE JUST PUT UP HERE THERE'S WHERE THE FIRES ARE. IN MALIBU AND YOU CAN SEE THIS FIRE JUST A ROCKED AND HOPEFULLY THIS THIS WILL PLAY BUT HERE THIS IS THE WALLS THE FIRE YOU GONNA WATCH IT JUST EXPLODE. OKAY AND YOU CAN SEE HOW WINDY IT IS THIS IS AN ANTENNA HERE. AND IT'S JUST -- THIS FIRE JUST EXPLODED IN THIS WHAT WE CALL THE INCIPIENT FIRE PHASE. OKAY -- I WISH YOU WOULD PLAY -- THESE ARE ALL UP ON OUR WEBSITE AT THE AND THE SIZE M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; LAB --&lt;/c&gt;</u> AND YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THESE BUT THIS IS EXPLOSIVE FIRE ACTIVITY KING. SO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT SEVENTY CAN. YOU'VE GOT THREE OTHER SPEAKER SO I I I I WISH I ROUTES ARE A REALLY GOOD STUFF THAT I'D LET ME I JUST LET ME JUST END UP THEN. WITH -- I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT TREES AND DEAD TREES WHICH THE FERGUSON FIRE -- BUT HERE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS THIS IS MONA SETO TWENTY THREE PEOPLE DIED OVERNIGHT HERE. OKAY SO THERE'S THESE CASCADING DISASTERS. IMPLICATIONS FOR INSURANCE SO I WANT TO JUST LEAVE YOU WITH WE LIVE IN A TIME OF WEATHER WHIPLASH. AND EXTREMES AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE YOUR GO AWAY AND THE CO TWO IT'S MAKING OUR ATMOSPHERE AND OCEANS MORE ENERGETIC. AND IT'S CAUSING THESE WHETHER SWINGS FROM FLOODING IN GURNEE BILL IN MAKING AN ISLAND IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER. TO BURNING DOWN WHEN THE WIND BLOWS. YOU WANT TO PULL OVER YES WE GET. THREE MORE WITNESSES SO CHAIRMAN DODD SAID -- WE'RE RUNNING A SHORTER TIME HERE WITH THE HEARING ROOM SO FEDERAL TO TRY TO KEEP THEIR PRESENTATIONS TO ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THE MORE OF COURSE HAVE ALL MY CONTACT POLITICS. YOUR INSPIRED NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT IT'S GOOD INFORMATION -- WERE HAPPY TO HAVE YOUR DAY SUPPLY I KEEP TALKING IF YOU DIDN'T CHAIRMAN DOT DOT DIDN'T SHOW. OKAY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GRAIN THANK YOU TRIMMING DOT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY -- I'M GONNA SKIP TO A LOT OF SITES TO CATCH UP ON TIME. SO -- MY BACKGROUND IS REALLY IN METEOROLOGY AND SO THE FIRE WEATHER RESEARCH LAB IS THE ONLY ACADEMIC PROGRAM IN UNITED STATES FOCUSED ON FIRE WEATHER RESEARCH -- WE TEACH ONE OF ONLY TWO CLASSES AND FIRE WEATHER AS SOON AS A STATE. AND SO OUR RESEARCH IS IN FIRE WEATHER FIRE DANGER AND SUCH SO I JUST WANT TO KIND OF CLICK THROUGH A FEW THINGS REAL QUICK. AS WE KNOW THE FIRE BEHAVIOR TRIANGLE. EXTREME FIRE BEHAVIOR IS A FUNCTION OF FUELS THE STUFF THAT'S BURNING THE TOPOGRAPHY AND THE WEATHER AND THE WEATHER IS THE MOST VARIABLE AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON AND SO -- WHAT I WANT TO STRESS TODAY IS WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW NETWORKS EVERYBODY'S PUTTING OUT MORE WEATHER STATIONS? THESE ARE THE SERVICE NETWORKS THE DOTS ON THE MAP THERE ARE ALL THE WEATHER STATIONS THE POT OR THE PUBLIC OWNED WEATHER STATIONS. IN THE STATE AND PROVIDE REAL TIME DATA BUT IT'S GENERALLY HOURLY SOMETIMES FIFTEEN MINUTE. IT'S REALLY THOSE DATA ARE USED FOR FIRE DANGER RATINGS SO IF YOU SEE SMOKEY THE BEAR AT A PARK IN HIS HANDIS UP HIGH. POINTING TO HIGH FIRE DANGER THOSE DATA ARE WHAT MAKE THAT CALCULATION. AND SO. THE PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE NETWORK WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HAPPEN WE REALLY NEED IT FAR WHETHER BEHAVIOR MODELS IS THAT. IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THESE EXTREME EVENTS WERE THE WILD FIRES CREATE THEIR OWN WHETHER WE STILL DON'T HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT IS. AND SO -- THIS IS A ACTUAL SIMULATION USING A COUPLE AND I JUST WANNA CLICK TO SHOW YOU KIND OF THE IT'S MOVING BUT THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE OF FIRE WEATHER MODELING IS A COUPLED MODEL. IT'S WHERE THE FIRE IS DRIVEN BY THE WEATHER AND THEN THE FIRE ACTUALLY PUTS ITS HEAT INTO THE WEATHER MODEL AND SO IT'S COUPLED AND THAT'S KIND OF THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE THE COMPUTATIONALLY IS VERY HIGH. BUT WE CAN DRIVE THOSE MODELS AND SO IF WE SKEWS ME ASK DOT. THIS IS THE SAME MODEL SIMULATING THE TUBS FIRE THIS IS MY STUDENTS WORK -- THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE WINDS DURING THE TUBS FIRE AND WHAT YOU SEE AND ONLY USES POINTER HERE. THIS IS NOT SAY HALINA THIS IS -- THIS COFFEE PARK AND THE REDS ARE NGUYEN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S CALLED A HYDRAULIC JUMP. AND THAT'S EXTREME WHEN. SURFACING AND WHERE THE HYDRAULIC JUMP DIES LANDS. DETERMINES IF IT CAN BE REALLY REALLY WINDY OR NOT AND SO WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND STRUCTURE WE CAN'T MEASURE THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. AND AS A RESPONSE AND I JUST WANNA SKIP TO THE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS. THE WINDS MOVE FROM A LAW AFTER UP ABOVE IN THE HIGHER PART ATMOSPHERE TO THE SURFACE REALLY RAPIDLY. AND SO. WE DON'T MEASURE THAT WITH WEATHER STATIONS RIGHT NOW SO WE DEVELOPED A MOBILE AT MR PROFILING SYSTEM THAT WE TAKE A WILD FIRES -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INSURANCE ON IT I WANT TO CLICK THROUGH WITH TALK ABOUT A DOPPLER LASER RADAR THIS RONA GET. TO THIS INSTRUMENT CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE PLUMES AND REAL TIME ON A FIRE [inaudible] SO THAT'S DEL PATEL FIRE PLUME WE CAN ACTUALLY PROPUBLICA LIKE X. RAY INSIDE THE FIRE AND WE CAN MEASURE THE WINDS INSIDE THE FIRE. AND SO WE WERE THE ONLY -- ME LOGICAL TEAM IN THE U. S. THAT'S FIRE LONG QUALIFIED. AND SO WE OF ACCESS TO GET TO THE FIRES OR A NATIONAL RESOURCE WE GET REQUESTED INCIDENTS AS WELL. AND SO SEE HERE. THIS IS THE CAMPFIRE WE DEPLOYED TO THE CAMPFIRE WHEN IT IGNITED AND WHAT YOU SEE. IS THAT THE WINDS ARE REALLY STRONG ALOFT WELL ABOVE THE GROUND BUT THEY'RE NOT VERY STRONG NEAR THE SURFACE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE. BUT THEY WEREN'T STRONG AND SO WHAT WE CAN WHAT WITH THE LIGHTER ALLOWS US TO DO IS LOOK AT THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE PLUME AND WHERE WE CAN'T WITH THE SERVICE NETWORK. WE ALSO FLEW AN AIRPLANE TO A MAJOR FIRE ICE WHEN I HIGHLIGHT THE RADAR. THE LIGHT OR IS REALLY GOOD IT'S A LASER BEAM THAT WE SIGNED INTO THE FIRE BUT WITH THE RADAR WE CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE BIG DEEP COLUMNS BIG -- FOR PLUME DRIVEN FIRES AND SO F. -- AIRCRAFT WE FLEW IT THROUGH A FIRE AND AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE REALIZE THE DATE ARE SO GOOD THAT WE REQUESTED A GREAT WE PLAYED FOR A GRANT. AND WE NOW HAVE THE ONLY MOBILE RADAR IN THE WESTERN US IT IS THE ONLY RATE ARE ON THE U. S. TUNE FOR WILDFIRE RESEARCH. IT'S A SPECIAL K. BEYOND ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT PARTICLES AND THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SEE EMBERS BEING TRANSPORTED IN THE PLUMES OF WHERE THEY MAY FALL. AND SO THIS -- READER BE DELIVERED AND APRIL AND SO WE'LL HAVE IT TESTED BY THE FIRE SEASON SO GIVE US TO MOBILE ASSETS -- I'M GONNA KIND OF SKIP TO HEAR BUT WHAT WE'VE ALSO DONE IS WE'VE PUT A INFRARED CAMERA SYSTEM VERY SMALL AND ON THE SAME AIRCRAFT. AND WE'RE GONNA BRING THAT AIRCRAFT TO CALIFORNIA PLACE IN READING AND TWENTY TWENTY IF WE GET THE FUNDING. AND THAT'LL ALLOW US TO DO HIGH RESOLUTION WE'RE TALKING TWO METER SIX FOOT RESOLUTION MUCH HIGHER THAN SATELLITE. AND ONE SECOND -- DATA THE WHOLE FIRE AND THE DINNER TRAY A COMPUTER HAND HELD OR ON THE FIRE LINE AND SO. GETTING TO THE POINT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE ASSETS WE HAVE THE PLATFORMS WE CAN PUT THIS TECHNOLOGY ON AND SO IF YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT THIS ON AIR TACTICAL AIRCRAFT THAT THE ONES THAT FLY ABOVE AN INCIDENT THAT MANAGE THE SUPPRESSION AIRCRAFT. AND THEN YOU CAN MAP IT OUT IN REAL TIME AND THE DATA TRANSMITTED VIA SATELLITE. SIMILARLY YOU CAN TAKE A TANKER. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS MANUFACTURER WITH THE NET DATA PROBE THE THIS NEW LOGICAL SENSOR CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE NEUROLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS IN REAL TIME ON ACTIVE WILDFIRE. FASTER THAN A WEATHER STATION AND ALL THESE DATA ARE TRANSMITTED SATELLITE SO WE GET TURBULENCE IN ADDITION. THAT SENSOR PACKAGE GIVES YOU AIRFRAME STRAIN AND SIZE ONCE GET THROUGH HERE AND FINALLY GET TO THIS LAST SLIDE. A NETWORK OF VERTICAL PURFLING RADAR LEASE RADARS ARE LIGHT OURS THIS IS SOMETHING WE DO NOT HAVE IN THE STATE THESE DOTS OF THESE LEGAL. OR SUGGESTED LOCATIONS WHERE I WOULD PUT THESE. WE DO MAYBE DO THE EIGHTY CORRIDOR WE DO THE NORTH BAY WE DO LA BASIN AND THESE CAN ACTUALLY DETECT SMOKE IN REAL TIME THEY CAN ALSO MEASURE THE WINDOWS ARE COMING DOWN. AND THEY'LL THAT ALL THAT DATA IN JUST INTO A WILDFIRE -- PROJECTION SYSTEM AND SO JUST YOUR SCHEMATIC YOU GET ALL THE DATA FROM THE AIRCRAFT TO GET IT FROM THE MOBILE -- ASSETS AT SAN JOSE STATE IT GOES INTO A SUPER COMPUTER IT SPITS OUT THAT FIRE COUPLE MODELING SYSTEM. AND THEN THOSE ASSETS SEE HAPPENING WE'RE GONNA TEST THE RADAR THIS SUMMER AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE THOSE MODEL OUTPUTS ON OUR WEB SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING THIS NOW. BUT I THINK. THE MAIN GOAL IS THE MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE TODAY'S THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. WE CAN PUT THIS ON OUR CURRENT AIRCRAFT AND WE CAN COLLECT MORE DATA SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT NEW ASSETS OUT IN THE FIELD THAT'S ALREADY THERE WE JUST HAVE -- TO ADD AND TECHNOLOGY TO THEM. SO WITH THAT I'LL JUST. END. FIFTY SIX THANK YOU TO GO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION THREE TO SPEAK -- I'M OKAY OUT ON THURSDAY NIGHT OF PRESENT A NUMBER OF OF RESEARCHERS AT THE UC SAN DIEGO -- AND IT'S A PERFECT ACTION SICK VERY FROM SENSING AND CAMERAS AND BOTH NEAR AND REMOTE SENSING TO MODELING. AND AS YOU SEEN DURING A FIRE THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION GOING ON A STRONG THAT. IN A WAY THE AGENCY IS FOR MONITORING OF THE FIRE WHICH I WILL CALL. NOW CASTING. AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION AND USING IT TO PREDICT THE FIRES BEHAVIOR ITS DIRECTION THAT IT'S GOING TO BE CAN HELP THE DECISIONS RELATED TO IT WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL FOR CASTING. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS FOR CASTING CAN BE DONE BUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY IS. LINKING ALL THIS MODELING AND THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT DURING THE FIRES. TO WHAT I WITH COOL DISASTER INTEL INTELLIGENCE. SO. THE SOLUTION HERE IS TO BUILD A AS CHAIRMAN DOT SAID A CLEARING HOUSE SO TO SAY THAT'S INTELLIGENT AND NEUTRAL. SO IT'S NOT -- TRY WITH IN THE SENSE THAT THE BOND. PARTY OWNS THE DATA. AND INTEGRATE TO IT AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE TO CATALOG CURATE -- EXCHANGE -- ALLIES AND COMMUNICATE INFORMATION TO THE AGENCY IS TO THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY AND ALSO TO PUBLIC FOR PUBLIC EVER IN THIS INSPIRATIONAL. NEEDS THAT CAN ARISE AROUND FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND AFTER FOR RESILIENCE -- SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND OVER THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN BUILDING AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS TO COLLECT DATA. AND USE THEM FOR MONITORING VISUALIZING AND PREDICTING FIRE BEHAVIOR IT'S CALLED THE WHY FIRE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THERE'S A PHONE BECAUSE OF THAT I DISTRIBUTES A HOPEFULLY IT WAS DISTRIBUTED DURING MY TALK -- SO THE IDEA IS COLLECT ALL THE DATA AND SERVICE IN A WAY THAT MODELS CAN INGEST. AND OF COURSE IS A PART OF OUR EFFORTS FEE BILL DYNAMIC DATA DRIVEN FIRE MODELS FOR THREE MY TO BE COLD AND DYNAMIC DATA DRIVEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MODELING IS GETTING THE DATA IN REAL TIME. AND MAKING SURE WE CAN ADJUST THE MODELS. SO WE CAN ACTUALLY COME FROM THE UPDATES. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MONITOR AND CHANGE THE FIRE SEE IT IS BEING FOUGHT HOW THE RAIDERS CHANGING LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY. AROUND THE FIRE AND HOLLOW. THE PERIMETER IS EVOLVING BUT HOW BOUT EVACUATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE AND ALL THAT INFORMATION CAN BE SERVED THROUGH ONE PLATFORM. TO ANYONE WHO'S TRYING TO MODEL THE FIRES WAS TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS. AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THE FIRE ENOUGH TOOL IS THE RESULT OF THIS THREE MILLION DOLLARS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION SUPPORT THAT WE DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LA FIRE DEPARTMENT -- ME GOOD ADVICE FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES HUNDRED TWENTY SIX AGENCIES ACTUALLY COLLABORATED WITH US TO UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING IN RESEARCH MODE -- OVER THE LAST YEAR BEAVER SUPPORT OF AN OPERATIONAL FORM OF ID LA FIRE DEPARTMENT AWAY COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT VENTURA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. AND SHE FANTASY MIGHT SPEAK LATER -- ALSO THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY. SO THIS IS A PLATFORM TO TAKE ALL THAT DATA THAT COULD ANYONE CAN USE AND US US BOTH IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE THE MAIN. PUT THE LAYER ON TOP OF IT TO COMMUNICATE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA AND OTHER FIRE RELATED DATA INFRASTRUCTURE CENSUS POPULATION SMOKE AIR QUALITY IN YOUR NAME AT ANY DATA THAT CAN RELATE. TO ALL HAZARDS IN NASA'S NOT JUST FIRED ABOUT THE USE THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF FIRE MODELING AND WE HAVE OUR OWN FIRE BEHAVIOR MODELS THAT BE INTEGRATED BUT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO INTEGRATE. ANY MODEL. THAT OF THE STATE IS USING ARE WILLING TO USE IN THE LONG TERM. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT FIRE NOT TO GET -- DURING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CAN ORDER IN CALIFORNIA FIRES. THIS INFO INFRASTRUCTURE TO WORK ON THIS GOT OUT OF COURSE WE DON'T MAKE THE FORECASTING OF THE FIRE AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC. BUT THE REST OF SAID FRUSTRATION THE VENISON ON THE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PUBLIC USERS ALONG WITH THOSE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FIRE AGENCIES GOT ON THE SITE. SO THAT SHOWS ALSO THE PUBLIC'S UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND DISINTEGRATES AS YOU SEEN SOME OF THE BETTER STATIONS THAT YOU SEE IN CAMERA DATA. SMOKE PLUMES RED FLAG ALERTS. ANNOUNCED FIRE PERIMETERS DETECTIONS FROM SATELLITES AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION WE CAN BRING. FOR SITUATION LIVE IN THIS. IT WAS ALSO USED IN SOME OF THE LA COUNTY FIRES LA ACTUALLY HAS A WORK FLOW MANDATE START TO MODELING THE MOMENT THEY RECEIVE THE ALERTS. AND SOME OF THOSE ALERTS COME FROM FOR INSTANCE ALERT WELFARE CAMERAS. YOU CAN EVEN GO TO A CAMERA AND WHICH ON THE SMOKE AND THAT INFORMATION GETS INGESTED INTO THE PLATFORM AND THE MODELING STARS FROM THEN ON SO IT CAN BE MADE IN A SEAMLESS FASHION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE TECHNIQUES THAT. THE MOMENT A FIRE IS DETECTED AUTOMATICALLY -- IN MODEL CAN BE START IT CAN EVEN BE DONE -- BUT NOT REALLY ON THE WERE ADVISED BY T. FORDER ON THIS. THE DAY BEFORE TO FIRE REYES ON THOSE DANGER ALERTS BUT IF A FIRE HAPPENED HOW DO YOU -- OKAY THREE SOURCES WHAT'S INITIALLY SAN DIEGO FIRE DEPARTMENT NOW ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY AFTER CHIU FANTASIES MOVE THERE -- THAT -- THE AIRCRAFT FROM GENERAL ATOMICS FLIES VERY ABOUT THE FIRE. SUPPRESSION OF FOR EFFORTS TO AT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FEET -- THE DATA HE GOT -- AND THE THE SORT OF A RADAR AND OTHER INTERNET BASED SENSING THAT'S EXTENSIBLE -- THE PERIMETERS WE CAN GET PRETTY DETAILED PARAMETERS DURING A FIRE FROM THESE AIRCRAFT THAT INFORMATION WE ARE USING TO ASSIMILATE INTO FIRE MODELS SO WE CAN CONSTANTLY GENERATE NEW FIRE MODELS AND IN THE MODEL CAN BE GENERATED IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. IS IT ACCURATE. IT SCIENTIFICALLY THE ACCURACY CAN DID CHANGE BUT IS IT FAST AND IT DOESN'T HELP WITH DECISION SUPPORT YES IT DOES ABSOLUTELY A 100%. AND HERE WE'VE SEEN A DURING JULY LIKE FUN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EVERITT THE STF. THREE EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING YOU WERE GETTING THEIR PAYMENTS ARE SENATE WAS BEING FED THE CALLAWAY SCOTT SYSTEM THAT THE DIRECTOR DO OUTREACH EMISSIONS. QUITE BRIEFLY. SO DURING THOMAS FIRE WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL NOW I SHOWED INITIAL ATTACK SCENARIOS. DURING THE THOMAS FIRE WHAT HAPPEN IS THERE WERE FOUR DIFFERENT BETTER EVENTS SIGNIFICAN ROTARY VENTS THE FIRE STARTED IT'S MOVED IT'S MOVED AGAIN IT MOVED AGAIN SO MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRE AND HOLLYWOOD EVEN THOUGH BACK BURN TYPE OF SCENARIOS. WHAT HAPPENS IF SOME AREA BURNS FOR THE FIRE GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN THIS TYPE OF SCENARIOS? OF WAS. ANALYZED IN THE FIRE CAMP I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU WITH THOSE FOUR BETTER EVENTS AND WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE. IF I MAY SAY ONE LAST THING THERE'S A HUGE UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE SATELLITE DATA WAS DISCUSSED WE HAD SOME -- COLLABORATIONS WITH HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE COMPANIES -- INCLUDING PLANET VERY CAN GET DATA AT THIRTY CENTIMETERS TO FOOT FIFTY CENTIMETER RESOLUTION USING THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW WE CAN USE THAT DATA YOU CAN UNDERSTAND LAND COVER AND OTHERS. CHANGES ON OVER TO LAND JUST LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES I RESOLUTION PICTURES. SO THAT MEANS THE FUEL MODELS FOR INSTANCE WHAT BURNS DURING THE FIRE CAN BE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS EVEN ON THE WEEKLY FASHION -- USING EFFICIENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES AND WHAT WE GET FROM THEM LIKE VEGETATION CLASSIFICATION CAN BE MADE AS A PART OF THESE FIRE MODELS. AND CAN YOU SORT OF TO THE MODELING COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THROUGH THIS NEUTRAL PLATFORM -- THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH THE WIFI. ANOTHER THING HERE THAT YOU SEE IS HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PREVENTION CAPABILITIES BECAUSE BY PUTTING ENOUGH A DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND HOMES AND IDENTIFYING WHAT AREAS NEED FOR ORDER DEFENSIBLE SPACE FROM THIS IMAGERY. IT ACTUALLY CAN HELP WITH WHAT BURNS OR WHAT SHOULD AND BURNED DURING THE FIRE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE DAMAGE BY CAREFUL ANALYSIS USING THESE TECHNIQUES. SO AND THESE EMISSIONS FORTIES WILL BE IN THE COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS RANGE BUT IT CAN SAVE BILLIONS AT TIMES -- AND LIVES OF COURSE WHICH ARE PRICELESS THANK YOU. THEY FOR TESTIMONY. SO MY NAME IS TAREQ SODIUM A PROFESSOR OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AT UC BERKELEY AND I'M AHEAD OF THE FIRE RESEARCH GROUP -- THAT'S A COLLECTION OF PEOPLE -- THAT ARE WORKING PRIMARILY AND ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY -- CAUGHT FIRE. WHICH SO. I'LL SIMPLY CLICK FORWARD -- IN THE EASY WAY TO PDF SO BASICALLY THE THE MAIN. IMPETUS OF THIS WAS A COLLECTION OF SCIENTISTS FROM UC BERKELEY LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABS NASA. SPACE SCIENCES LABORATORIES AND WITH FIRST RESPONDERS AND WE'RE ROUGHLY THIRTY PEOPLE THAT HAVE DECIDED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW IN THE FIRE SPACE. AND SEE WHETHER WE CAN REDUCE THE COSTS AND MAKE THEM EASY TO PRODUCE. AND UBIQUITOUS SO THAT THEY'RE BASICALLY -- READILY AVAILABLE TO FIRST RESPONDERS SO WE'RE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH FIRST RESPONDERS TO DEVELOP THE GADGETS AND TO REDUCE THE PRICES ON THE COSTS USING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES. I WON'T BORE YOU WITH ALL THE DETAILS AND FOR RUNNING VERY SHORT ON TIME BASCALLY THE MAIN -- FOR THRUSTS THAT WE HAVE ARE DEPLOYABLE SENSOR SYSTEMS IN REAL TIME MOBILE OF FIREFIGHTING. THAT MEANS ESSENTIALLY -- WORKING CONSTANTLY ON U. A. V. TECHNOLOGIES MAKING THEM CHEAP INEXPENSIVE AND ALSO ADAPTIVE. SO THE MAIN IDEA HERE IS TO AVOID -- LARGE -- UAVS THAT ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO REDUCE THE COSTS AND MAKE THEM EASILY DEPLOYABLE AND EASY TO LOSE AN EASY TO REPRODUCE SO THE MAIN IDEA HERE IS WE DON'T INVEST A LOT OF MONEY IN EACH INDIVIDUAL GADGET. WE'RE TRYING TO PRODUCE MASS PRODUCTIONS OF THESE GADGETS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE THEM AT AT ANY GIVEN TIME SO THE IDEA IS IS VERY MUCH LIKE A CELL PHONE. REDUCE THE COSTS MASS PRODUCTION USED THROUGH ADVANCED MANUFACTURING SO THAT REALLY LEVERAGES WHAT BERKELEY STRENGTH THIS AND ESSENTIALLY AND SILICON VALLEY. IT IS THE MASS PRODUCTION OF MANY GADGETS AND MAKING THEM CHEAP TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST. WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY FIRE PEOPLE I MEAN MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING IN FIRE TECHNOLOGIES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WERE MAINLY PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN THE MANUFACTURING ASPECTS REDUCE THE COSTS AND THE MAN IN THE GADGETS THEMSELVES. BECAUSE THEY SAID THE FOUR MAIN THRUST ARE YOU A VIS MOBILE REAL TIME COMPUTING. THAT MEANS SIMPLY PUTTING THE COMPUTERS ON THE UAV'S DIRECTLY. SO THE IDEA IS IS NO MORE SUPER COMPUTERS EVERYTHING IS LOCAL EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE A SEAT BASED ESSENTIALLY ON THE U. A. V. DIRECTLY ITSELF. AND IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP AND REPRODUCIBLE AND THAT TECHNOLOGY DOES EXIST NOW. HI WE'RE ALSO LOOKING GET A LARGE WE'RE TEN LEND MUCH OF OUR MOBILE COMPUTING -- WITH THOSE KINDS OF SYSTEMS AND THEN THEY KEEP STRENGTH AND I GUESS STRENGTH NUMBER FOUR IS REALLY WHERE -- WE PUT A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND THREE D. PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING SO THE MAIN IDEA THERE IS HOW TO PRODUCE THESE TYPES OF DEVICES INEXPENSIVELY. AND IN THE LARGE SCALE SO -- THE TYPICAL APPROACH OF COURSE IS TO TAKE A U. A. V. MOUNTED CAMERA ON IT AND SIMPLY PEOPLE DEPLOY IT. THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH MOST YOU A VISA IF YOU'VE EVER HAD ONE AND I'VE HAD MANY OF THEM. IS ARE NOT SIMPLY. EASY TO CONTROL IN A TURBULENT ENVIRONMENT IN A FIRE LIKE ENVIRONMENT IS SEEN IN MANY OF THE VIDEOS ALREADY BEFORE. A U. A. V. IS GOING TO FAIL I MEAN THEY'RE BASICALLY GOING TO BE PUT INTO SOME TYPE OF HIGH VORTEX -- TYPE OF THE SYSTEM THE CAMERA SILLY RAYCROFT WHERE THE U. A. V. SO BASICALLY COLLAPSE SO WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON ADAPTIVE CONTROL STRATEGIES. TO HAVE THESE THINGS ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT -- IN EXISTING A TURBULENT SYSTEM THAT MIGHT BE IN A FIRE SITUATION THE KEY HERE ALSO WITH THESE ARE INEXPENSIVE IF WE LOSE A HUNDRED OF THEM WHO CARES WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM. SO IT'S EXACTLY LIKE WE HAD WITH CELL PHONES WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUAL GADGETS THAT COST A LOT WE WENT TO MASS PRODUCE THEM. WE WANT TO ALSO THEN LOOK AT THE ECONOMICS OF EXACTLY HOW YOU MAKE THESE -- YOU KNOW -- AVAILABLE EASILY TO ROUTE FIRST RESPONDERS -- SORT OF FOR THE WHERE DID ALL OF THIS STUFF COME FROM IT WAS A LARGE SUPER COMPUTING CENTER THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THE US ARMY FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS BETWEEN BERKELEY AND STANFORD. PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN EXPLOSION TECHNOLOGIES WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WORK. GADGETS THE COULD PREDICT HOW EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED -- THIS WAS PRIMARILY DONE ON THE EAST COAST WITH THE ABERDEEN PROVING GROUNDS WHAT WE DID IS WE USED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FAST CALCULATIONS ON PREDICTING WHERE IEDS WOULD BASICALLY -- EMITS AND PRODUCE HOT FRAGMENTS FROM THEIR WITHIN BRANCH ON TO HOW WE DO THE COMPUTING LOCALLY AND THEN HOW THE CAMERAS WOULD BE DEPLOYED SO THAT WE COULD ESSENTIALLY. PROBE INTO EXTREMELY TURBULENT AND VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTS WITH RELATIVELY FAST AND EASY GADGETS AND TECHNOLOGY SO -- FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ASSEMBLY SAY THAT WHAT WERE -- CURRENTLY WORKING ON A SWARM TYPE TO AS OF THOUSANDS OF DRONES RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVELY AND TRYING TO MIMIC THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR USING ANIMAL -- TYPE PSYCHOLOGIES IN USING THOSE AS CONTROL ALGORITHMS FOR THE DRONES TO THE BASIC IDEA IS AS MUCH LIKE YOU HOW YOU SEE HOW STARLINGS BEHAVE. WERE EMBEDDING THOSE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES INTO THE DRONES THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN MOVE ESSENTIALLY IN AN ECONOMIST FASHION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A FIRST RESPONDER ON HAND SO. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS IT'S ADVANCED MANUFACTURING -- IMP LEVERAGING ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND THREE D. PRINTING -- THAT'S OF COURSE ESTIMATED TO BE A ONE TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY -- BUSINESS OVER THE LAST HOUR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS I THAT'S PRIMARILY THROUGH DIGITIZED TECHNOLOGIES -- THE BENEFIT OF COURSE THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS RELATIVELY CLEAR SMALLER CARBON FOOTPRINT INCREASED DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS -- AND THEN OF COURSE IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY PROFIT MARGINS AND SO FORTH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO SELL ADVANCED MANUFACTURING IN THE STATE. SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING REPLYING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES TO THE FIRE -- ECO SYSTEM SO I THINK IT ECHOES WHAT REPRESENTED DODD HAD INDICATED BUT CLEARING HOUSES. THE ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS THAT ARE INVOLVED I'VE WILL THAT WERE WERE RIGHT YOU DIFFERENT AND METHODS [inaudible] DIFFERENT FOR WE FELT THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT SINCE WE WERE ALL CHOKING BASICALLY LAST NOVEMBER -- ESSENTIALLY AS YOU CAN SEE THE BAY AREA WAS BASICALLY SUFFOCATED AT THAT POINT WE COLLECTED EVERYONE TOGETHER AND WE DECIDED WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT EACH TECHNOLOGY SCRUTINIZE IT AND DETERMINE HOW WE CAN MAKE IT IN EXPENSIVE. AND EASILY DEPLOYABLE SO THAT'S BASICALLY OUR MISSION THANK YOU. IMPRESSIVE THANK YOU. THIS TIME WILL WELCOME. CHIEF -- FIRST EMERGED FIRE THREE UP TO ONE BUDGET TESTIMONY. SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS SOME FOLKS MAY HAVE SOME TRAVEL PLANS IF YOU HAVE. BENDING FLIGHTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MESS CERTAINLY -- LEAVE THE INFORMATION BEHIND AND WE'LL CALL YOU WITH QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE HAVE WE ADJUSTED OUR TRAVEL PLANS IT WAS IMPORTANT WE GOT IN FRONT OF YOU. AND SURE BUT WE NEED TO SHARE WITH YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON -- YEAH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK TODAY BY YOU KNOW BOTH PANELS ABOUT YOUR CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND WHATNOT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY ABOUT TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. THAT WITH FUNDING I WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE NOT ONLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FIRST OFF MY NAME IS BRIAN TENNESSEANS MENTION ON THE FIRE CHIEF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY. THE CFA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FIRE TWENTY THREE CITIES IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF THE COUNTY WE SERVE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION RESIDENTS FROM SEVENTY TWO FIRE STATIONS. PRIOR TO MY APPOINTMENT A FIRE CHIEF AN ORANGE COUNTY LAST YEAR SPENT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WITH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FIRE DEPARTMENT. THREE THOSE YEARS IS THE CITY'S FIRE CHIEF. MY FIRE SERVICE CAREER BEGAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS AN EMPLOYEE WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE IN ALTERNATELY WITH THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT THIS IS MY FORTY FIRST YEAR. IN THE FIRE SERVICE IN OVER THE YEARS A RESPOND TO SOME OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN THE WESTERN US. IF THERE WAS EVER ANY QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE SINGLE HIGHEST THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY IS IN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS ANSWERED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND AGAIN IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I RECOGNIZE THAT THE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FAR AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE UNLIMITED BUDGETS HOWEVER. MORE MUST BE INVESTED IN TESTING NEW OR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL AID FIREFIGHTERS ON THE GROUND. CONCEPTUAL MODELS AGAIN AND THEN SHARED TODAY. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS REAL EMERGING TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THROUGH THE VISION OF TWO PILOT PROGRAMS TO THAT IN AGAIN I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE PROJECT THAT WE HAD ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY. OR WORKING. ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WILL STILL THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO'S FIRE CHIEF AMID A LOCAL -- DEFENSE CONTRACTOR GENERAL ATOMICS. THEY BUILD AND FLY A VARIETY OF PREDATORS IN IN WAR THEATER -- THEY APPROACHED US AND WE'RE WILLING TO PROVIDE MANNED AIRCRAFT THAT COULD BE USED DURING A WILDLAND FIRE. WE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE SAME STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGIES ON BOARD THE GENERAL ATOMICS AIRCRAFT IN HOUSTON WARTIME THEATER APPLICABLE WITHIN OUR OWN WILDLAND FIRE ENVIRONMENT. FIRST RESPONDERS LACK RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE REAL TIME INFORMATION SUCH AS VIDEO AND FIRE PERIMETER MAPS. DURING THE INITIAL ONSET OF WILD LAND FIRES AND I'LL GET BACK TO WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. PROVIDING FIRST RESPONDERS WITH DEDICATED AERIAL RESOURCES THE POSSESS TECHNOLOGIES DEDICATED. TO INCLUDING VIDEO AND DATA LEE ENHANCE INCIDENT DECISION MAKERS SITUATED WITH SITUATIONAL AWARENESS THUS IMPROVING THE PROBABILITY OF SAVING LIVES IN PREVENTING A LOSS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY GENERAL ATOMICS AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS IS LEVERAGING THESE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. THEY CAN PROVIDE ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE DURING THE INITIAL ATTACK OF A WILDLAND FIRE. AND OTHER EMERGENCIES THE SYSTEM IS PROVEN. INDUSTRY USED SUCCESSFULLY IN PAST INSISTS THE LILAC FAR WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT THE PREVIOUS PANEL -- DISCUSSED BECAUSE THIS SYSTEM IS TURN KEY THERE ARE NO DEVELOPMENT COSTS. IT WILL EMPLOY QUALIFIED PUBLIC AGENCY PROFESSIONAL FIRE FIRST RESPONDERS FIRST RESPONDERS TRAINED IN TACTICAL AIRSPACE COORDINATION. IT WILL CAPITALIZE THE GENERAL ATOMICS MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SURVEY AND RECONNAISSANCE PERSONNEL EXPERTISE. IMAGINE. AND ALL WEATHER AIRBORNE PLATFORM OPERATING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FEET WELL ABOVE ALL OTHER TACTICAL AIRCRAFT PROVIDING REAL TIME IMAGERY MAPS FIRE PROGRESSION MODELING. ASSISTING GROUND BASED INCIDENT COMMANDERS AND DETERMINE AREAS OF NEED FOR IMMEDIATE EVACUATION AND RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT. THIS IS AVAILABLE NOW. IN A FUNNY BECOMES AVAILABLE THE ANY POINT COULD BE PUT IN A SERVICES SOON AS THIS SUMMER. THERE ARE OTHER SIMILAR ASSETS AVAILABLE BUT NONE. THAT ARE RESPONDING ON INITIAL ATTACK FIRE RESPONSE WERE REAL TIME INFORMATION SLOW SPEED THE NATIONAL GUARD. THE BOISE THERE A LOT OF OTHER PLATFORMS A PROVIDE SIMILAR INFORMATION SURVEILLANCE RECONNAISSANCE -- INFORMATION BUT TYPICALLY WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THOSE DEPLOYED WELL AFTER THE FIRES BEGUN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS AN AIRCRAFT SITTING ON THE GROUND READY TO RESPOND. WHEN OUR HELICOPTERS RESPOND WATER AIR TANKERS RESPOND IT'S IN THE AIR PROVIDING REAL TIME DATA TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE BACK OF THE BACK OF THE SUBURBAN? AND ALSO BEING COMMUNICATED TO THE YOUR SMART DEVICES WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S AVAILABLE NOW. AVAILABLE GO IN SERVICE -- THE GENERAL THOMAS MANN PLATFORM IS ALSO USING -- WHAT WE HEARD HERE TODAY THE UNIVERSITY SAN DIEGO'S WHY FIRE PROGRESSION MOLLY YOU SAW A GREAT MAP FROM THE LILAC FIRE UP THE DOCTOR OTAGES FLASHED UP? THAT REALLY KIND OF YOU KNOW PUT WE'LL VALIDATED THE THE ACCURACY OF THE TOOL -- THE TECHNOLOGY ISSUE DISCUSSES BEEN USED BY LA FIRE THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS LA FIRE GETS A RESPONSE. THEY GET A LOCATION ON THE MAP THE PAIN GETS DROPPED IT GIVES US COMMANDERS. WHERE THAT FAR PROGRESSION MODELING IS THE DIFFERENCE IS THE AIRBORNE PLATFORM OVER THE TOP THAT FAR PROVIDING CONTINUOUS AS LONG AS THAT CAMERAS ON IT? IT'S CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING THE MODEL AND SO EITHER NOT ASKING FOR CALLING BACK AS IN DROP A PIN DROP ANOTHER PIN DROP. IT IS CONTINUOUSLY MODELING. ANOTHER VALUE ADD IN THIS IS ONE THAT I THINK YOU'LL APPRECIATE ONE WE GET ALL THE TIME AS FAR APART AS IS YOU KNOW. WHAT WAS YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE THE THE END RESULT THAT FAR WILL TELL YOU -- WE LOST THREE HUNDRED STRUCTURES YOU KNOW HALF A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE. IMAGINE YOU'RE HAVING THAT FIRE MODEL MAP. COMPARING IT AGAINST THE ACTUAL SUPPRESSION MAP IN BEING ABLE TO GO BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW HAD WE NOT STOPPED HERE ON THIS REGION THIS ROAD WE HAVE LOST TWO HUNDRED HOMES POTENTIALLY ANOTHER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVEN'T HAD A TOOL LIKE THAT THAT THAT ALLOWED US TO QUALIFY THAT IS IN THE OTHER. VALUE AT NOT TO MENTION DIRECTOR GIL ARE DUE TO TALK ABOUT. THIS FEEDS DIRECTLY INTO IT SO YOU'RE GETTING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION ALL THE STATE EOC IS OF A LOCAL UC'S THIS IS AVAILABLE. NOW -- ONE OTHER PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WORKING -- CLOSELY WITH IS -- CALLED THE IT'S A IS A NIGHT TIME TYPE ONE HELLO TACK OR HELLO TANKER HUBBLE FREEL PROGRAM THERE SOME GREAT QUESTIONS EARLIER BY SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT NIGHT TIME FIRE FIGHTING. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN AYE TIME FIRE FIGHTING FOR FIFTEEN YEARS DEVELOPED A PROGRAM AND HAVE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT WHAT IS VERY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WE'RE GONNA SHOW UP. PROBABLY LESS THAN A MINUTE VIDEO ON IT. IS THIS IS WITH WHAT WE CALL A TYPE ONE HELL ATTACKER OF VERY LARGE HELICOPTER DRINKING. DROPPING LARGE VOLUMES OF WATER. AT NIGHT. BIG DIFFERENCE IS THEIR HOVER FILLING FROM NATURAL WATER SIZE SOURCES WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME FOR THE DATE TIME THE GOING TO THE LAKE AND THEY COME OUT WE DON'T DO THAT. NO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN I'VE I'VE OPERATE NIGHT AND HELICOPTERS WE HAVE TO LAND. HOSE COMES OUT WE PLUG IN WE FILL TAKE SOME TIME. SOON AS IT'S DONE WERE OFF THE RECORD MANY FIRE. TO BE ABLE TO HOVER FILL IN A SOURCE NEXT THE FIRE OR IN A TANK. MEANS WAR WATER MORE PRODUCT IS GOING ON THAT FAR THAT IS AVAILABLE NOW -- IT IS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED THIS MODEL IN AUSTRALIA QUITE FRANKLY AUSTRALIA'S DOING SOME THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW AT NIGHT WITH AVIATION RESOURCES THAT WE'RE NOT -- DIRECTOR PORTER -- TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE NIGHT OF FIXED WING AIR TANKER PROGRAMS THAT WERE NOT DROPPING AND I HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. YOU'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A PROGRAM IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE DROPPING AT NIGHT. EACH YEAR THE TECHNOLOGY IS ON THE DOORSTEP -- WE'RE JUST NOT QUITE THERE YET HERE LOCALLY -- WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AGAIN AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOST COUNTIES OURS INCLUDED OPERATE NIGHT TIME FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT? BUT IF YOU LIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NAME ANY OTHER LOCATION A STATE YOU HAVE A FIRE AT NIGHT. YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GETTING ORANGE COUNTY OR LA COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY THEY'RE NOT COMING UP YOUR FIRE. THE FOREST SERVICE DOES OPERATE ONE HELICOPTER AT NIGHT IT'S OUT OF FOXFIELD LANCASTER. IT MAY COME UP TO YOUR FIRE TAKE SOME TIME THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED THIS PILOT PROGRAM. PUTS A NIGHT TIME. HEAVY HELICOPTER TYPE ONE HELL ATTACKER AVAILABLE TO ANY. ANY FIRE DEPARTMENT ANY JURISDICTION STATE LOCAL FEDERAL ANYWHERE THE STATE. THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE NOW -- ALL PLAY A QUICK VIDEO IN THE ESSENCE OF TIME AND THEN WE'LL WRAP THIS UP. WE'VE BEEN WORKING THE LAST TEN YEARS -- IN NORTH AMERICA ON A LIFELINE PROGRAM THAT INVOLVES THIS AIRCRAFT WHICH IS THIS COURSE GUESS. SEVENTY SIX HAS A THERMAL IMAGING CAMERA ON THE NOSE OF IT. AND WORKING ON WITH A FIREBOMBING HELICOPTER WHICH IS THE S. SIX IT LIES ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. AND IT'S USED TO PROTECT THE FIREBOMBING HELICOPTERS SO WE REALLY TAKE THE RISK OUT OF THE FIRE BOMBING OPERATIONS. SO THE AIR TAC OFFICER WHO'S UP IN THE FRONT -- WILL -- SELECTED TARGETS AND THEN I WILL MOVE THE CAMERA ON TO THAT DESIGNATED TARGET -- TURN ON THE LASER -- WHICH STAND ELIMINATES THAT AND THE SIXTY ONE JUST FOLLOWS THE BEAM DOWN TO THE LASER ON THE GROUND AND DROPS THE WATER. IT'S AN OPERATION WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT OPERATING LIKE THIS THE UNITED STATES AND I AND I CAN SAY THIS AGAIN HAVING -- VAN A NIGHT TIME WATER DROP OPERATIONS IS. TWO THOUSAND FOUR YOU KNOW THERE WAS A QUESTION EARLIER BY ONE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ASKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DROPPING WATER DURING THE DAY AND AND AT NIGHT TIME -- THE TYPICALLY IN THE WINDS ARE BLOWING IS IS STRONGLY AT NIGHT TO WE'RE NOT TALKING TO SANTA ANA WIND DRIVEN FIRE. TYPICALLY THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY IS ARE UP. ARE DROPS ARE ACTUALLY MORE EFFECTIVE ALL THE AIRCRAFT BECAUSE IT'S JUST A FEW FLYING WHICH READS COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE GROUND OF THE AIR MUCH MORE CLEAR -- IT'S A GAME CHANGER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS PROGRAM DOES THAT OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE NOT IS IT MEASURE SUCCESS. WITH THE THE LASER BEAM THAT CAN ONLY BE SEEN THROUGH THE NIGHT VISION GOGGLES THEY'RE IDENTIFYING ANY HAZARDS IN THE AREA THAT THAT HELICOPTER THIS GOING BACK AND FORTH THE FIRE MAY RUN YOU KNOW THAT THEY COULD CAUSE A HAZARD. IN IDENTIFIES WHERE EXACTLY IS TO DROP WHERE THE DROP INS. AND THEN THE STRING TOGETHER IN YOUR ABLE ACTUALLY COME BACK TO SAY LOOK WE'VE MEASURED SUCCESS THIS IS WHAT WE DID THIS OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE. AN FOR NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL WE REDUCE THE RISK WE SHUT DOWN IF WE'RE NOTBEING SUCCESSFUL WE SHOULDN'T BE FLYING IN PUTTING PILOTS AND OTHER PEOPLE AT RISK. THIS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT DOES THAT THIS IS OPERATING NOW IN AUSTRALIA IT'S AVAILABLE HERE THE STATE. AND IS SOON WILL BE OUT SEEKING FUNDING TO TRY TO MAKE THIS A REALITY. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME -- AGAIN I I RUSHED THROUGH A A PROBABLY WELL SCRIPTED COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR BACK IS PROBABLY GONNA BE PRETTY GOOD ON THE FLIGHT HOME BECAUSE SHE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS BUT I REALLY WANT TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT YOU. YOUR QUESTIONS RELATED TO EITHER SO THANK YOU. EIICHIRO TESTIMONY IN THANK YOU -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME MOVIES FOR SENATOR DIES ASSURED ME THAT WILL COME DOWN AND TAKE THE COPTERS OUT FOR A SPIN CAN YOU COME ON DOWN WE'LL TAKE KERRY. WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS OR HAVING -- QUESTIONS FOR THE CHIEF. I'M SORRY MAN. SO RUBIO AND I APOLOGIZE HAVE TO STEP OUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW WHAT IS THE COST OF A ONE AIRCRAFT YOU KNOW WHAT THE THE CONTRACT PROGRAM. FOR THE GENERAL ATOMICS PROGRAM INCLUDES YOU KNOW THE TWO PILOTS YOU KNOW ON THE RAMP A TACTICAL FLIGHT ALL THE EQUIPMENT THE RADIO INFRASTRUCTURE. ONE TIME EXPENSES SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS ONE POINT ONE MILLION OF THAT IS THE RADIO INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S A ONE TIME EXPENSE THAT THE GOVERNMENT THAT OWNS IT'S A PLACE. WILL BE ABLE -- TO ON ALL THE LOCAL MOUNTAIN TOPS TO BE ABLE TO THE CALL THE MEASURE THAT WORK TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM. THE HELICOPTER PROGRAMS ABOUT. THREE AGAIN 424- HOUR COVERAGE -- FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS IN AVAILABLE TO PICK UP AND PRE POSITION OF LIGHTNINGS BEING FORECASTED FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE IS IT CAN PICK UP MOVE AND BE AVAIL RESPONDED EIGHT OR NINE IN THOSE AREAS. IT BECOMES A STATE RESOURCE ONCE IT'S IN THERE THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU CHAIR. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- IN THIS QUESTIONS I'M ASKED THE THE FOLKS ARE GONNA COME UP AT YOU KNOW AFTER YOU THERE WERE ALREADY UP HERE. THIS IS GREAT FOR US TO SEE THIS STUFF BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY POWERFUL AND ULTIMATELY WHEN BUDGETS COM YEAH WE NEED TO SEE THIS. BUT I GUESS I I I'M HOPING. THAT THERE'S AN OUTLET FOR EVERYBODY HERE. WITH THE STATE -- WE US AND WITH AL FIRE. AND THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE NEW TECHNOLOGY OR NEWER TECHNOLOGY. YOU KNOW I I HATE TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT WE DID WE JUST BOUGHT THESE OR THE CALL ON THAT HOT. BLACKROCK. RIGHT IT NO YOU'RE NOT THE DIRECTOR -- DIRECTOR POOR AND I'VE HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS FAQ HOW FAR UTILIZED THE GENERAL ATOMICS PLATFORM BOTH IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOR THE FIRES IN SANTA ROSA THE TUBS FAR SO THE RARE IN FACT I'M VIOLATE THE TIME -- DIRECTOR PIMLOTT ANGULAR DUTY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO SO YOU GUYS GOT TO SEE THIS THIS IS THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS THEY GOT ON A PLANE CAME DOWN WENT WILD. OKAY WAITED NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN LAST YEAR WOLSEY THE CHALLENGES. WHEN GENERAL THOMAS GETS THE PHONE CALL DURING THE MIDDLE FAR SAYS YOU GOT TO GET THIS PLANE UP THERE THERE'S NO CONTRACT IN PLACE OR NO MECHANISM -- YOU TALK TO THE FOLKS ON THE WALL SEE FAR THEY'LL TAKE A LOT OF THEM THAT WERE MAKING DECISIONS IT WAS IT WAS SEVERAL DAYS IN DID KNOW THE PLATFORM WAS UP THERE THEY WERE DOING DISASTER -- ASSESSMENT WHICH WAS NECESSARY. BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO THE TRICK IS TO GET IT ON CONTRACT GET IT INTO THE SYSTEM THAT ALL OF US TO THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM HAVE ACCESS. TO YOU KNOW HOW FAR NEEDS IT THEY PLACE AN ORDER IT'S IN THE AIR AND ON THE WAY THE FOREST SERVICE I'VE ALSO TALKED TO THE DIRECTOR FAR AVIATION. HE AND I HAD A VERY LONG CONVERSATION WITH -- WAYNE COLSON. WE CALLED ONE THIRTY THIS YEAR UNDER CONTRACT TO CAL FIRE SO WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL VERY WELL CONNECTED WHERE TRUST WE WERE WE'RE TALKING A LOT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR OKAY GREAT. HEY THIS LITTLE OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU. CHIEF. THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE -- TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO ANYONE. IN THE AUDIENCE TO ANY QUESTIONS. FOR ANSWERS IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE OTHER FOR THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT STILL HERE. I GUESS I HAVE THAT SAME QUESTION SO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO A PINE IN TERMS OF YOUR TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATING INTO. THE STATE SYSTEM YOU KNOW WHAT YEAH WHAT'S HAPPY YOU'RE WORKING -- COLLABORATE COLLABORATIVELY WITH EACH OTHER YOU KNOW WITH THE STATE HOUSE AT ALL WORK IT OUT. THE COURSE IS THREATENED TO THE RESEARCHERS THERE IN THE FRONT ROW. CAN REPEAT THAT AGAIN. I I'M INTERESTED IN IN THE IN THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION WITH CAL -- YES CAL FIRE -- JUST IN TERMS OF IN AGREE HAVE WITHIN THE STATE. YEAH OF THE APPARATUS IF YOU WILL IN IN IN IN TRYING TO WORKED. YOU KNOW TOWARDS A NUMBER -- ONE I PREVENTION OF FIRES INTO SUPPRESSION OF FIRES. FIRST AS A STATE ONE THING IS WE ARE INTEGRATED WITH A LOT OF THE FIRE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS WE GET REQUESTED TO THE FIRES. TO PROVIDE THE ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS AND SO THOSE DATA ACTUALLY ARE PROVIDED TO THE INCIDENT METEOROLOGISTS. DATE WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED ON THE DETWILER FIRE WHERE THEY CLEARED AIRSPACE SO WE CAN A WEATHER BALLOON UP BECAUSE AIRCRAFT SUPPRESSION -- WAS REDUCED BECAUSE THE SMOKE A LOT OF TIMES SMOKE HINDERS THE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS SO GETTING A THESE TYPES OF SOUNDINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S NOT EASY TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL ACTIVE -- AIRCRAFT -- OPERATION SO WE INTERACT A LOT OUR DATA GOES OUT AND WE MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AS WELL AS SAME WITH THE SENATE THE STATE -- WEATHER FORECASTING MODEL IT'S UP ONLINE ONE KILOMETER OVER THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO YEAH. SAME THING WITH UC BERKELEY WERE LOOK WE'RE WORKING WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES -- PHILANTHROPISTS AS WELL AND SILICON VALLEY OBVIOUS IS A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT THEIR AIR QUALITY -- AT LOT OF INTERACTION ALSO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY BOARD -- TO MONITOR CONTROLLED BURNS AND TO TRY TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO SHARPEN THE PERMITTING PROCESS SEES. OF WHEN YOU DO -- CONTROLLED BURNS JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- WHEN A FIRE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO DO A CONTROLLED BURN THEY HAVE TO GIVE A TWO WEEK NOTICE THEY GIVE A TWO WEEK NOTICE THE FOR AIR QUALITY BOARD DETERMINES? YES YOU CAN DO A A CONTROLLED BURN BUT THEY CAN YANK THAT PERMIT UP UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE. AND IT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE USED TO BASICALLY PREDICT THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE SOMEWHAT COURSE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THIS STATE AGENCIES TO BRING THE TECHNOLOGY TO BEAR THAT SHARPENS THESE KINDS OF ESTIMATES THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE. TO THEY REDUCE THE COSTS OF THE FIRE THE FIRST RESPONDERS THEMSELVES SO FOR EXAMPLE A FIRE DEPARTMENT WHEN THEY'RE PERMIT GET YANKED A DAY BEFORE COSTS ALL THE PEOPLE THAT GOT DEPLOYED. AND THEY BASICALLY YOU KNOW -- LOSE A QUITE A BIT OF MONEY SO IS THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS IN ON WHICH IS COST REDUCTIONS I THINK THAT'S AGAIN OUR THEME. THERE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERTS IN FIRE TECHNOLOGIES RINSES IN THE LARGE SCALE MANUFACTURING MAKING THINGS CHEAP AND WORKING WITH ANY AGENCY THAT WANTS TO REDUCE COSTS -- ALSO. GOING GREEN ON THE DATA TECHNOLOGY PART THE BEEN COOPERATING CLOSELY -- IN RESEARCH MODE -- WITH THE NUMBER OF FIRE DEPARTMENTS CAL FIRE AND HELLO YES AND SEE IF YOU. ANA'S VIEW GOING FROM THAT MOTOR HOW CAN MAY ACTUALLY BE THE NEUTRAL PLATFORM THAT CAN INGEST DATA FROM STATES NETWORK SOME SORT OF DONE TO MODELING COMMUNITY AND OTHERS. OF INTERFACES TO THE STATE ALL. I THINK IT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THERE IS RIGHT NOW WE ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE TO SUSTAIN THESE TOOLS. I THINK A PROFESSIONAL FUNDING AT THE STATE LEVEL WOULD HELP THESE INDIVIDUAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND THE OVERALL COMMUNITY AND THIS IS COMPLETELY AN OPEN PUBLIC PLATFORM. SO IN A SENSE BY FIRES HAVING NOT GROWTH CHALLENGE OF YOU KNOW THERE'S A USEFUL RESOURCE PRODUCT THAT IS BEING OPERATIONALIZE AND HOW CAN ME. OF MADE OF RACIALIZED AT SCALE YOU -- CAL FIRE DISPATCH -- SENT ELENA ALSO MONTAVISTA SO WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM SO THEY HAVE LIVE CONTROL OF THE CAMERAS. GAS AND CONFIRM NINE ONE ONE WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH CALLOW YES -- TO LOCATE -- STRONG MOTION SENSORS ON SOME OF OUR TOWERS SO THAT THEY BECOME MULTI HASN WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH CINEMA WATER. DISEASE FIRES A REAL PROBLEM FOR WATER QUALITY AND SO WE HAVE MOISTURE SENSORS AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER SO WE CAN DETECT -- AND TRY TO BETTER PREDICT AND UNDERSTAND HOW THESE ATMOSPHERIC RIVER SET UP AND WHAT KIND OF FLOODING AND RESULTS GONNA HAPPEN SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ACROSS THE BOARD WITH ALL THESE AGENCIES BUT WE ALSO. HAVE -- PUBLIC WEBSITE THE PEOPLE CAN GET ON AND AND CHECK THEIR OWN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND THANKS AGAIN FOR TODAY. SO I THINK THE GENERAL TAKE AWAY THERE'S THAT YES THERE'S A LOT OF COLLABORATION GOING ON BUT WE COULD DO BETTER. DOCTORS GIVE YOU COULD -- THE BEER TEN THE QUESTION I ASKED I THINK TO PREVIOUS PANEL. WE HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT CAMERAS THE DEPLOYMENT AND SOLD CURRENTLY GOT EIGHTY FIVE CAMERAS I THINK IT WAS DEPLOYED MOSTLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS TO DO NOT TO TO ADD ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED CAMERAS. I ASSUME MOST WAS CAMPUS WILL BE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- GIVEN THAT WE HAVE EIGHTY FIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURSE MAYBE IT WORKS LIKE THE LEGISLATURE DOES IN MOST THE RESOURCES GO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT SO GEN. EDUCATE ME ON THE SUBJECT SO SO HERE HOME. I DO HAVE A SLIDE THAT SHOWS WE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CAMERAS IN CALIFORNIA NOW -- EIGHTY FIVE WHEN IN SINCE DECEMBER. AND WE'RE POPULATING WE'RE WORKING WITH THE THREE UTILITIES P. JEANNIE -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND ES DE JEANNIE. TWO YEARS AGO WE INSTALLED CAMERAS FOR SDG AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS STILL IS AND THEIR COMMAND CENTER -- WITH MOVED UP AND WORKING WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC SO YES WERE POPULATING THE NORTHERN PART WE HAVE CAMERAS IN ORTH BAY -- WHERE THE TUBS FIRE NUNS FIRE WERE AND -- THE CAMERAS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THIS -- ASK WOULD BE CAMERAS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE THREE MAJOR UTILITIES. SO THAT WE COULD POPULATE THIS AND SO THE THE UTILITIES OF STEPPED UP IN A BIG WAY AND HAVE A GREAT VISION BUT THERE POPULATING THEIR TIER. TWO TIER THREE FIRE HAZARD REGIONS AND THE MONEY WOULD BE TO POPULATE THE REST OF THE STATE WITH CAMERAS SO THAT WE HAVE A GOOD COVERAGE OF THE VIEW SHED. IT IS YOUR PAIN IS A HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CAMERAS IS -- IS ADEQUATE OR IS IT IS THERE A A PERFECT WORLD NUMBER WE SHOULD BE IT GETS OLDER SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THESE -- CHAIRMAN AS WE INSTALL THE CAMERAS AND TRY TO DETERMINE -- THE VIEW SHEDS AN OPERATION AND SO THERE'S INSTALL ASSESS THEN FILL IN. SO -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED CAMERAS TO GO IN AND TWENTY NINETEEN SO THAT'LL ADD THAT'S FUNDED BY UTILITIES. AND THEN THE HUNDRED CAMERAS TO PUT IN THE AREA WHERE IT'S OUTSIDE THEIR OPERATION. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED CAMERAS BY TWENTY NINETEEN MIDDLE. TWENTY TWENTY AND ON THE ESTIMATES VARY BUT WORKING THROUGH THE VIEW SHED AND TYPOGRAPHY WERE ENVISIONING PROBABLY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CAMERAS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GIVEN ANSWERS WERE SO I WENT UP TO THE THESE VIEW SHOWS ACTUALLY ARE WAS OF ALL ON THE MAP SO HE COULD SEE THE COVERAGE OF THE CAMERAS AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE DATA SYSTEM THAT CAN THEN JUSTICE CAMERAS AND OTHER FORMS OF SENSING PLATFORMS AND INFORMATION THAT AMOUNT. THE SENSE DATA IS THERE IS A CAPABILITY THERE ARE TO BE ABLE. TO FILL IN THE BLANKS WITH DIFFERENT FORM -- OTHER FORMS OF INFORMATION CAN BE USE AN INFORMATION COULD BE MADE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE ON THE FLY SO THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY CURATION AND CLEANING OFF THESE DATA SETS. AND SERVING THEM. SO THERE IS ALSO AN ABORTION TO USING THESE PAST FIVE YEARS AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THOSE CRITICAL PLACES TO PLACE THE CAMERAS AND STRATEGIC DEPLOYMENT AS POSSIBLE USING THIS TYPE OF DATA. THANK YOU NAPA NAP I HAD YOU KNOW THESE FIRES A KEEP SPARKING UP IN THE SAME AREAS THERE SEEMS TO BE. YOU KNOW CERTAIN VALLEY'S TOPOGRAPHY VENTURI EFFECT THESE DROPS AND AND THEY SEEM TO BE THE SAME IGNITION POINTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THESE AND AND TO GET EARLY THIS EARLY INCIPIENT FIRE PHASE IS CRITICAL. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THOSE ANSWERS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR MAKING THE TRIP THE NEW TEST ME. OKAY AT THIS TIME WE'LL GO AHEAD MOVE BACK TO PUBLIC COMMENT I SEE OUR FIRST -- PUBLIC COMMENTER RIGHT THERE. HI CHRIS FOR SITES REPRESENTING OPPY STREAMS ARE CALIFORNIA COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURES AMONG OTHER THINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE INDEPENDENT MOBILE OPERATING SATELLITE EMERGENCY SYSTEM. A SINGLE SMALL UNIT ARE HIGHLY MOBILE CAN PUT UP ON NINE HUNDRED SQUARE MILE COMMUNICATIONS BUBBLE IN JUST FIFTEEN MINUTES. WE SUPPORT THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY -- THE WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT WHEN OUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS INEVITABLY COMPROMISED LIKE THE HUNDREDS OF TOWERS THAT WE'VE LOST. THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE -- IN INFRASTRUCTURE INDEPENDENT OPTION THAT CAN BE ROLLED OUT THAT QUICKLY REESTABLISHES COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY. I IT'S A GAP IN OUR TECHNOLOGY TO SENATOR DODD'S SENTIMENTS THAT AT SOME KIND OF ONE STOP SHOP. NOW WOULD BE A GOOD THING. THANK YOU. I FIRST I SAY THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN DODD AND CHAIRMAN GRAY MY NAME'S SERRA CONCERNED I'M LISTEN TO AND ENERGY. I'M TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY OF PREVENTING THE IGNITION. SO PREVENTION IGNITION AS WE KNOW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AND TO ACHIEVE THIS THE CALIFORNIA TOADIES HAVE BEEN USING WITHIN A POWER SHUT DOWNS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR SOLUTION WHICH IS GREAT IGNITION SOURCE DETECTION WHICH IDENTIFIES GREAT EVENTS SUCH AS SPARKS AND VEGETATION CONTACT. THAT OFTEN LEAD TO WILD WILD FIRE IGNITION. THIS CAN TECHNOLOGY CAN FOCUS BOTH ON PREVENTIVE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND POWER SHUT DOWNS TO LOCATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST RISK OF WILDFIRES [inaudible] SO -- LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SYNDICATE THIS -- THIS TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TODAY WITH US WE ARE CALIFORNIA COMPANY. AND A STATE WIDE DEPLOYMENT OF GREAT IGNITION SOURCE DETECTION TO CALIFORNIA. HI FIRE DETECTION THERE IS TO BE COMPLETED VERY QUICKLY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND WOULD BENEFIT FIRE PREVENTION FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. AT ONE TIME COSTS THAT PRESENTS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE BUDGETS PROPOSED. SO WE URGE THE STATE UNTIL THE LEADERS TO PRIORITIZE SENTENCE VAST TECHNOLOGY IN THE BATTLE AGAINST WILDFIRES TO GET RESULTS QUICKLY AND AFFORDABLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COURCELLES -- HERE ON BEHALF OF GEO LINKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY -- WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY -- SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE INSTALLATION OF FIRE DETECTION CAMERAS AND COMMUNICATING THE DATA THAT THEY PROVIDE -- THROUGH WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY -- INFO IN THE INSTALLATION OF DOZENS THESE PROMOTE AREAS SOLAR POWERED CAMERAS -- WE'RE WELL POSITIONED IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A STATEWIDE SYSTEM TO EXPAND THE USE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND OTHERS TO HELP PREVENT DETECT WILDFIRES WITH FOUR TO BEING A RESOURCE TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR -- JOKER -- FORMER A FIREFIGHTER AND RETIRED FAR KEPT ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY SAME FIRE THIRTY THAT THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM. FORMER WHILE AND FAR DEFENSE PLANNER FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND OF FOR PRESIDENT OF ORANGE COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS FOR VICE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND NOW FORMALLY WITH A DISTRICT FIELD REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS AND AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THE HEARING I REALLY APPRECIATE. IT WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE LORD WILD FIRE AND THE FIRE CAMERA SYSTEM THE THE SAME FORMER GOVERNOR TO GET YOU INVOLVED IN THIS GOT ME INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE IT'S A TOOL IN OUR ARSENAL. THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE -- AS CHIEF FANTASY KIND OF REPORTED ON THE HOLY FIRE WE CAN SEE THAT FIRE STARTED WAS A FIELD DRIVEN FIRE HE COULD PICK UP HIS PHONE AND IN REAL TIME WITH A HAND HELD DEVICE. A TO GIVE HIM A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD IN THE PAST. HE WAS ABLE TO SEE THE THE FIELD. HE'S ABLE TO SEE THE FIRE HUSING THE FIRE WAS A FEDERAL LAND HEADED TOWARD STATE LAND IN A TOWARDS RIVERSIDE WHICH IS AGAINST USUALLY THE NORMAL FIRE CORRIDOR. HE COULD SEE THE TONNAGE OF THE FIELD DEAD ALIVE RATIO AND HE COULD GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR INCIDENT. NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE OVERNIGHT BUT OVER IN A WEEK. SO THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE IN REAL TIME IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE. WHAT THE DIRECTORS KIND OF RAW RESPONDED TO IS THE AMERICAN FIRE SERVICE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF OUR INDIE WHEN IT COMES TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE TO PARTNER WITH A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS OR NOT? NEW TECHNOLOGY INTUITIVE OUR JAWS OF LIFE USUALLY COME FROM PLACES LIKE NASCAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MONEY FOR OUR DAY ARE SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. COMES FROM NOW SO AND MINE SAFETY AND THIS TECHNOLOGY FROM THE ACADEMICS FROM. THE FOLKS WHO SPOKE TODAY IS AMAZING THE SECOND THING THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY DOES BESIDES LETTING YOU KNOW WERE FIRE IS SO YOU COULD AUGMENT RESOURCES PROPER RESOURCES. SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT UNITS TYPE ONE ENGINES STRIKE TEAMS FOR STRUCTURE PROTECTION TYPE THREE ENGINES DOZERS HAND CREWS AIRCRAFT ROAD RE FIXED WING. THE SECOND THING IT DOES IS WE'VE SEEN IT -- ALSO WELL WORN OF ARSONS ARSON FIRES WHEN THERE'S A DIVERSIONARY FIRE LIT. ALL RESOURCES GO TO THAT FIRE LIKE MOTHS TO A FLAME AND I'VE SEEN THE CAMERA SHOW THAT SECONDARY FIRES HAVE BEEN LED TO TAKE ON HOMES AND THE THIRD THING. AND WE SEEN ON THE HOLY FIRE IN THE CANYON FIRE ONE CANYON FIRE TO IS REKINDLES REKINDLES ANY CELL VIDEO OF IT TODAY. ARE ARE A BIG PROBLEM FIRES ONCE THEY'RE OUT IN THE AIR OF DROUGHT THEY DON'T STAY OUT THEY COULD SMOLDER UNDERGROUND IN OAK -- ROUTES AND SMILING FACE FOR MANY MANY WEEKS UNTIL WE GET MEASURABLE RAIN WHAT WE SAW IN THE HOLY FIRE WAS A RE CANDLE THAT NO ONE SAW. WAS IN FEDERAL LAND ABOUT TO TAKE OUT COUNTY ORIGIN SURROUNDING AREAS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET ON THE CAMERA'S ALERT THE LOCAL FIRE OF THORNY THAT THERE WAS A FIRE FEDERAL LAND AND AGAIN THREATENING STATE AND LOCAL AREAS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE IT'S A TOOL IN THE ARSENAL THAT I THINK CHANGES EVERYTHING IT'S KIND OF A GAME CHANGER AS FAR AS OF THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ON FIRES AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING CAL FIRE LOCAL. TWO EIGHT EIGHT ONE I'M AFRAID HAVE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS IN THE NINETIES AND THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO GRAY DAVIS'S REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE MAJOR REPORT AFTER THE FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE WHITE PAPERS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND TWELVE IN THIS NEW REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT. THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING ALTERNATELY. THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT WE WANTED IT'S HELPFUL. BUT IS THE DIRECTOR SAID ALSO. AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS DO NOT PUT OUT FIRES. THEY CAN PROVE THEY CAN STOP THEM IN THEIR TRACKS THEY CAN KEEP THEM FROM SPREADING AS FAST AS THEY WOULD. BUT WHAT PUTS OUT THE FIRE OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND OUR MEN AND WOMEN PUTTING OUT THE FIRES THEMSELVES. I WOULD REMIND THIS COMMITTEE THAT CAL FIRE HAS THIRTY ONE FEWER. ENGINES THEN THEY HAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THEY CAL FIRE HAS FEWER INDIVIDUALS TO DEAL WITH STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA THEN THEY HAD A GENERATION AGO. I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING THIS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN GREAT QUESTIONS ON THE CAMERAS IT'D BE GREAT TO HAVE CAMERAS EVERYWHERE. AND WHILE THE MATH ISN'T EXACT CAL FIRE HAS ONE ENGINE FOR EVERY NINETY THOUSAND MILES A STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. SO AS WE PLAN ON THE FUTURE LET'S REMEMBER LET'S TAKE CARE OF WE NEED MORE PEOPLE WE NEED MORE ENGINES. IN TERMS OF THE INMATES. THE INMATES DO THE JOB THAT THEY DO. BUT WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS EMPTY IN OUR PRISONS. SO THERE'S A REASON THAT WE HAVE THIRTY FEWER ENGINE THIRTY FEWER CREWS FROM THE STATE PRISONS AND IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE PRISONERS WHO QUALIFY FOR THEM. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO EMPTY THOSE PRISONS WERE GOING TO LOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE NEED FIREFGHTERS WE NEED ENGINES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PAGE MISSED CARE PROCEDURE TEST WELL YOU DON'T LOOK NEARLY OLD ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY. HI MY NAME IS LIKE AND I MADE AT THE TIME THEY AND DIRECTOR OF TENNESSEE LEVINE ALSO PROFESSOR OF DENTAL USE ONLINE FIRES ON THE ONLY MASTERS IN EUROPE. THE UNIVERSITY ALONE -- RUNNING THE COMPANY FROM SOME DEAL WHERE THE COMPANY AT THE BUILD THE SYSTEM FOR THE SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC ON THESE WORKING IN THE REST OF THE UTILITIES TO BUILD A MODEL A NUMBER THAT THE CAPABILITIES TO BETTER OPERATE THE NETWORK. I'M PROVIDE A SAFER BUT EACH AND FOR THE FOR THE CALIFORNIANS. AS A THE KNOWLEDGE USE TWENTY TWO YEARS OTHER THAN ALL OF YOU YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE PROVIDE THE OLD THAT TOYS HOLD IT. ALL THE TOOL I MEAN EVERYTHING OF THE BILL SO WE SO THAT WE CAN AGREE THEN THAT THE NO YOU SITE. IN THE END IT HAS TO BECOME A TOOL FOR THE GENTLEMAN THAT THEY WERE TALKING BEFORE TO MAKE THEIR JOB AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HE THOUGHT THAT IS HAPPENING OKAY A WHAT WE REALLY NEED THINGS FROM USE THE SUPPORT TO THE UNIVERSITIES THE SUPPORT TO THE TRAINING CENTERS. TO HOP BEARS SCIENCE BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE BUILDING DAY. FUNDS UNABLE THEY WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR FLORIDA STATE WITH THE TEXAS BUDDIES COLOMBIA CHILE THAT IS WORKING ON WHAT IS NEEDED. IT REALLY TO HAVE TO SUPPORT FOR THESE PEOPLE TO REALLY TRUST ON TOOLS THAT ARE BASED ON THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THINKS TIME AND THAT THIS TRAINING OKAY. THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT EVERYTHING THAT WAS C. OR REGARDING. TECHNOLOGY THE NUMBER YOU GET IS NOT GONNA SAFE OUT ALL THE REALITY THAT IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE'RE LEAVING SOON IT IS A PLACE THAT? WITH ALL THIS CAMERA WE'RE GONNA SEE BURNING. PROBABLY IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WE MAY SEE FROM ANY OF THIS COMING US OUR LANDSCAPE CHANGING. SO WE NEED TO MAKE OUT WHERE NOT ONLY A SUPPORT OUR PEOPLE HERE. WE NEED TO SUPPORT TO OUR CITIZENS ARE TOOL KITS TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY FIRE. YOU FIGHT FIRE. YOU HAVE MANY CHANCES TO LOOSE. DO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH FIRE AND WE HAVE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE FIRE YOU CHANGED OUR LANDSCAPE. BECAUSE THE PROBLEM THE FIRE HAS BEEN ALWAYS BE HERE THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE IS THEY'VE BEEN IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH. SO BET ON THE SOME OF THE FIRE BUT WITH BETTER SIGNS WILL BETTER TO KNOW YOU IT'S A GREAT APPLICATION. AND TO BE HONEST. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PLANES YOU MAY HAVE. I COME FROM A COUNTRY WHICH IS A SPAIN. WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AIRCRAFT FOR AN AREA IS SMALLER THAN CALIFORNIA. AND HE'S NOT ENOUGH YOU GO THROUGH THE PATH OF PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THEIR PLANES. YOU WILL NEVER GO BACK AND THAT IS NOT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT YOU'RE GONNA ONLY STUFF IT FIRES MANY MORE PRESCRIBE FIREFIGHTING MORE TECHNICAL FIRES I WE KNOW WE NEED MORE EDUCATION TO OUR COMMUNITIES. TO DO PROPERLY ON SAFE IN EVERQUEST SAFE ABOUT QUESTIONS WHEN THEY ARE LEAVING OUT BY THE ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU -- CHERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATE DARGAN. I AM REPRESENTING A BOTH A FIRE PERSPECTIVE IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE TODAY I HAVE WORKED IN THIS FIELD SPECIFICALLY FOR FORTY YEARS THIRTY AS A RESPONDING FIRE FIGHTER IN CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA. THE LAST TEN YEARS AS A BOOT STRAPS START UP SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIST. STARTING A SOFTWARE COMPANY THAT NOW TOUCHES THOUSANDS OF FIREFIGHTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. I WANT TO SPEAK TODAY AND THE NAME IS IN MESSAGE THAT I WANT TO BRING TO YOU TODAY IS. THIS IS A ROBUST PRIVATE INDUSTRY. OUR FIELD THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES WORKING HARD TO BRING TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO PUBLIC SAFETY [inaudible] THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE A MERGING INTO WITH SENSORS WITH SOFTWARE CAPACITIES WITH THE ABILITY TO MOVE DATA IN REAL TIME VIA FIRST NET. IS AN ENORMOUSLY HUGE AND SOON TO BE EXPONENTIALLY EXPLODING FIELD. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO YOU WITH ALL OF THOSE FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IS WHAT I DO AFTER THE NEED FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS FOR THE TRAINING AND THE EDUCATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO USE THESE TECHNOLOGY TOOLS? THAT'S A HUGE GAP THAT'S OUT THERE THE SECOND IS AS TO SENATOR DODD'S A SUGGESTION FOR THE CLEARING HOUSE. I DO BELIEVE THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE CLEARING HOUSE CAN BE EXTENDED INTO A FUSION CENTER SPECIFICALLY FOR WILD FIRE. BOTH CAL FIRE AND YES COULD BENEFIT GREATLY BY THE AGGREGATION OF DATA TO A CENTRAL PLACE AND THE UTILIZATION OF IT IN THE FUSION CENTER MODEL THAT WE'VE HAD WITH HOMELAND SECURITY SO I'D LIKE TO JUST. SUPPORT THAT IDEA IN EXTEND THAT OUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH HI -- CHAIRMAN GRAY AND EVERYONE ELSE THE COMMITTEE -- GRAHAM KENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA RENO.
