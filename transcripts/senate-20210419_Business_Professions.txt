PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE PURPOSE OF SB THREE NINETY EIGHT IS TO SUPPORT THE CREATIVE PROCESS THAT WOULD HELP SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF ANY ACCESS TO OUR CANNABIS MORE. HAS ARE KNOW VOTER OF PROP SIXTY FOUR FOUR YEARS AGO. HOWEVER ONLY A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. AND WE REMAIN IN A SITUATION WHERE. THREE OUT OF A. FOUR SPENT ON AND CAL IS SPEND IN THE ILLICIT MARC. NOW ONE OF IS THAT MAY LOOK. DON'T HAVE THE STATE CAPACITY TO DO THE REQUIRED. ORDINANCE LICENSE ACROSS AND REGULATIONS THAT- ARE REQUIRED UNDER PROP. SIXTY FOUR THIRTEEN. THIS UNDER SIX FOUR HAS THE ABILITY TO LIE. BUT IT KIND OF IT'S KIND OF A DEEP IN IT OWN OCCURS IF THE- IF THE BUSINESS SUPPLIES IN THE LOCALITY THEN AFTER SIXTY DAYS DOESN'T- HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL THINGS THAT THE LOCALITY HAS TO DO WHICH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. SELL WHAT SB THREE NINETY EIGHT DOES IS FORMALIZES% A PROCESS FOR A LOCALITY TO ENTER INTO IT WITH THE STATE INTO A CANNABIS LICENSING AGREEMENT SO THAT BUSINESSES CAN GET THEIR LICENSE THROUGH THE STATE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO OPERATE NOT ONLY STATE. BY THE STATE'S RULES BUT ALSO WITHIN THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IT ALSO DIRECTS THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO CREATE EQUITY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IT LOWERS THE LABOR PEACE THRESHOLD AGREEMENT FROM TWENTY TO. TEN EMPLOYEES AND THEN ONE KEY POINT THE ONE OF THE MOTIVATIONS OF COURSE FOR BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS IS TO BE ABLE TO. GET THE REVENUE FROM THE TAX RELATED TO IT AND SO IF THEY IF THE STATE GIVES THE LICENSE AND NOT THE LOCALITY WHAT HAPPENS DOES THE LOCALITY GET ANY REVENUE FROM THIS TRANSACTION. AND THERE WAS A- COMPONENT OF THE BILL WHEN IT WAS BEFORE GIVEN FINANCE THAT WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE ENABLED THAT HOWEVER WE REMOVED ANY OF FOR. WE ARE STE WE'RE WITH THE ACT TO FILL OUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE.

I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I AM ACTUALLY PROUD TO INCLUDE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY- IS ONE OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SOLUTIONS MY DISTRICT- AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO NOTE HOW STRANGE IT IS. THAT OPTOMETRISTS IN TRAINING HAVE TO GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA FROM CALIFORNIA- TO COMPLETE PART THREE OF THEIR EXAMINE SO IN ADDITION SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I WOULD URGE IS IT SOME POINT TO TRYING TO VICE A BETTER SCENARIO FOR CALIFORNIA'S UP COUNTY SUDENTS. TO MORE EASILY GET. THEIR LICENSE IN MOVING THE WORKFORCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR. I THANK YOU AS CHAIR- I TO- FIRST VOIGTS ONE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY THE SITUATION IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT JUST UNIQUE TO OPTOMETRY FOR EXAMPLE PHYSICIANS HAVE TO TAKE A THREE PART LICENSING EXAM TWO PARTS DURING THE MEDICAL SCHOOL ONE PART AFTER WONDER DURING THE RESIDENCY TRAINING. AND THEY ALSO HAVE THESE CLINICAL SITE EXAMS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES LOCATED. LET'S SEE NOT NEAR WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND MAYBE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND HAVE TO TRAVEL TO DO SO IN FACT THERE. ARE SOME ISSUES DURING COATED WITH- SOME OF THE PHYSICIAN- IN PERSON LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL NOT AS BAD AS WHAT'S HAPPENING UP THOMAS TREE RIGHT NOW- I WOULD MAKE NOTE I APPRECIATE THE- AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT- ONE QUESTION I DID HAVE JUST TO CLARIFY NOTING THAT THIS IS A THREE PART EXAM- THE- I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES REALLY WITH THE THIRD PART WOULD HAVE TO GO IN PERSON TO NORTH CAROLINA. THE FIRST TWO PARTS FROM MY UNDERSTANDING ARE ACTUALLY TAKEN WHILE AN OPTOMETRY SCHOOL. SO IT'S NOT CLEAR FIND AT THE END AMENDMENTS THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO ACTUALLY PASS AT LEAST PART ONE INTO WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BEFORE THEY GOT THEIR- GRADUATION. BEFORE THEY GET THE TEMPORARY LICENSE SO YOU'D HAVE TO BOTH GRADUATE AND ALSO PART AT LEAST PASS THE LEASE THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF THE LICENSING EXAM- JUST EXEMPTING THE THIRD PART UNTIL- THEY- RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD ALSO JUST QUICKLY MAKE NOTE THAT- THIS A TRY AS A COMMENT TO PEOPLE LIKE TO RUN THE LACING EXAMS WHETHER IT'S- OPTOMETRY MEDICINE THAT SUPPORT MEDICAL EXAMS OTHERS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO MUCH BETTER. IN MAKING THEIR EXAMS AVAILABLE SAFELY TO STUDENTS OF PEOPLE GET THE LICENSE BUT THAT'S ANOTHER COMMENT SO JUST IF I CAN GET A QUICK ANSWER THAT QUESTION. SIR WILK THE ANSWERS QUESTIONS YOU OBVIOUSLY READ THE BILL BECAUSE OF THOSE THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS SO. GRADUATE AND THEN PASS ONE PART ONE INTO BEFORE YOU COULD RECEIVE A TEMPORARY LICENSE.

CENTER BATES WELCOME YOU HAVE ONE BILL TO PRESENT TODAY SENATE BILL SIX FIVE TWO YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF SENATE BILL SIX FIVE TWO IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL AS IT WOULD EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED IN SB FIVE OH ONE. BY SENATOR GLAZER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO ADULTS AS WELL AS PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. SB FIVE OH ONE ESTABLISHED NEW REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE USE OF SEDATION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY AND PEDIATRIC DENTAL PROCEDURES SPECIFICALLY. IT REQUIRED THAT FOR PATIENTS UNDER THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE THE OPERATING DENTIST AND AT LEAST TWO ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL SHALL BE PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE INVOLVING DEEP SEDATION. OR GENERAL ANESTHESIOLOGY PERSONNEL WHO IS CERTIFIED IN PEDIATRIC ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT OR OTHER BOARD APPROVED TRAINING IN PEDIATRIC LIFE SUPPORT. IN AIRWAY MANAGEMENT MUST BE SOLELY DEDICATED TO MONITORING THE PATIENT AND BE TRAINED TO READ AND RESPOND TO MONITORING EQUIPMENT INCLUDING. BUT NOT LIMITED TO PULSE OXIMETER CARDIAC MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE PULSE CAPITAL GRAPH AND RESTORATION MONITORING DEVICES. SB SIXTY FOOD SIX FIFTY TWO THEREFORE EXPANDS THESE PROTECTIONS TO ADULTS SO THAT THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS DO NOT STOP ONCE A PATIENT TURNS THIRTEEN. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT FOR PATIENTS THIRTEEN YEARS AND OLDER THE OPERATING DENNISTON AT LEAST TWO ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL BE PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE. INVOLVING DEEP SEDATION OR GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND THAT THE DENNIS AND ONE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL MAINTAIN CURRENT CERTIFICATION IN ADVANCED CARDIAC LIFE SUPPORT. THE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WHO ARE CERTIFIED IN ACLS SHALL BE SOLELY DEDICATED TO MONITORING THE PATIENT. TRAINED TO READ AND RESPOND TO MONITORING EQUIPMENT I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR. AND WITH STAFF STAKEHOLDERS AND THE BOARD TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE PROPER TIME FOR THIS BILL TO TAKE EFFECT. BY DELAYING IMPLEMENTATION. THROUGH OF THE AMENDMENT PROCEDURE I'M ALSO CONTINUED WORK WITH THE- PARTIES ON PROVISIONS IN THE BILL RELATED TO MODERATE SEDATION. I APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS AND OUT OF YOUR STAFF. TO SUPPORT TO THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. AND AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING STANDARDS CRITICAL TO PUBLIC TO PATIENT SAFETY.

FACIAL SURGEONS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER PLEASE PROCEED TO COGNISANT OF OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS IF YOU IF YOU WILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS GARY COOPER REPRESENTING CALLIE MISS THE ORAL MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS ASSOCIATION. MANY OF YOU SITTING IN THIS CHAMBER I DON'T REMEMBER THE DIFFICULT AND EMOTIONAL PERIOD THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE HAD TO GRAPPLE WITH THE ISSUE OF MAKING PEDIATRIC DENTAL ANESTHESIA AT STAKE AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS SB BIBLE ONE MUCH OF THAT CAST WAS COMPLETED. NOW THANKS TO SENATOR BATES AND HER STAFF AND YOUR STAFF. WE ARE STRIVING TO ACCOMPLISH SAME RESULT FOR ALL DENTAL ANESTHESIA. I NOW LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO DR JEFF D. LOWE. TO DISCUSS THE REAL WORLD APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS SB. SIX FIFTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AGAIN PLEASE. BECAUSE OF OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS SERVICE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SIX FIVE TWO. MY NAME IS DR JEFFREY IN LITTLE PLAN THE PAST PRESIDENT OF AND REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS I'M ALSO A PROFESSOR OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL- FACIAL SURGERY AT BOTH WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES AND LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. I TREAT PATIENTS ALL DAY EVERYDAY NEEDS TO ACADEMIC HELP SETTINGS OR A PRIVILEGE TO TEACH AND MENTOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF DOCTORS. WILL BE HALF OF OUR MEMBERS PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB SIX A TEACHER IT WILL ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND ENSURE ONE STANDARD OF CARE IN THE DELIVERY OF OFFICE BASED DENTAL ANESTHESIA. ANESTHESIA IS AT THE CORE OF OUR TRAINING AND PRACTICE OR RESIDENCIA DUCATION STANDARDS REQUIRE A DEDICATED FIVE MONTH RESIDENT ROTATION ON THE MEDICAL ANESTHESIA SERVICE AS WELL AS AN ONGOING HEALTH PATIENT EXPERIENCE IN ALL FORMS OF ANESTHESIA. ZERO FOUR TO SIX YEARS OF RESIDENCY TRAINING. WE ARE TRYING IN MEDICAL ASSESS AND EMERGE MANAGEMENT ON. WITH OUR COLLEGE. ARCHERY AND ABILITY TO DELIVER OFFICE SPACE TREATMENT SAFELY AND AFFORDABLY TO PATIENTS. B. R. TEAM MODEL OF PRACTICE IS UNPARALLELED. THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED SB FIVE A ONE BY SENATOR GLAZER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH STRENGTHENED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DELIVERY A DEEP SEDATIONGENERAL ANESTHESIA TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. THAT BILL WHICH TAKES EFFECT ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO REQUIRES PRACTITIONERS TREATING PATIENTS UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN. OPERATE UNDER A TEAM DELIVERY APPROACH WITH AT LEAST THREE INDIVIDUALS PRESENT DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF SEDATION AND GENERAL ANESTHESIA. WILL FURTHER REQUIRES A TRAINED ANESTHESIA MONITOR WHO HOLDS PEDIATRIC ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT CERTIFICATION TO BE PRESENT. AS WELL AS MANDATES THE USE OF CAPNOGRAPHY BY THE ANESTHESIA TEAM. SB SIX FIVE TWO WILL APPLY THE SAME STANDARDS TWO ADULTS REPLACING PEDIATRIC ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT WITH ADVANCED CARDIAC LIFE SUPPORT CERTIFICATION WHICH IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF THOSE PATIENTS OVER THE AGE TWELVE. THE BILL EFFECTIVELY CREATE TO ONE STANDARD FOR THE DELIVERY OF DEEP SEDATION GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND THE DENTAL OFFICE. SUCH A CHANGE WOULD NOT ONLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY FOR ADULTS BUT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE CONFLICTING STANDARDS THAT COULD LEAD TO CONFUSION IN THE DENTAL OFFICE. FURTHER THESE CHANGESWILL NOT ONLY STREAMLINED THE DELIVERY OF ANESTHESIA BUT THEY WILL ALSO BRING CALIFORNIA INTO COMPLIANCEWITH THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS AND AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS STANDARDS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF OFFICE BASED DENTAL ANESTHESIA. SEVERAL PRACTITIONERS ADMINISTERING DEEP SEDATION OR GENERAL ANESTHESIA SHOULD ALREADY BE FOLLOWING THE STANDARDS OF CARE. SB SIX FIFTY TWO WOULD SIMPLY CODIFY CURRENT PRACTICE RATHER THAN INFLICT ON REASONABLE OR UNDUE BURDEN ON THE DENTAL PRACTITIONER.

THANK YOU FOR- SENATORS- PLEASE PRESENT SB THREE OH SIX. WE ARE AT A CRISIS POINT WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE INFECTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY SO EVEN AS WERE MASON COVERED OVER THE PAST YEAR. WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS RISE IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE IN FACT THE CTCS THE CDC ESTIMATES THAT ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE AN STD. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ON THE SIXTY EIGHT MILLION STD INFECTIONS WERE REPORTED AND RATES OF SYPHILIS. COMEDIA AND GONORRHEA- UP 40% SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. CALIFORNIA HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST DIVORCE RATE IN THE NATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN EFFECT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE SIMPLEST RATE AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED AND 43% THIS CITY CRISIS AFFECTS COMMITTEES ACROSS THE STATE BUT CALIFORNIA YOUTH PEOPLE OF COLOR GAYS BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. OVER HALF OF ALL STDS IN THE STATE ARE REPORTED AMONG YOUTH AGES FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. AFTER AMERICANS ARE HONORING CHLAMYDIA DENTAL WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THESE DISPARITIES ARE EXPECTED TO WORSEN AS A RESULT OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN WE CAN ALL GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. S. ONE OF THE HARDEST DATA POINTS FOR ME TO SQUARE HAS TO DO WITH THE RATE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. A DISEASE THAT MOST OF US THOUGHT WENT AWAY WITH THE VICTORIAN ERA. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE BABIES WERE BORN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IN CALIFORNIA I 9100% INCREASE IN TWENTY TWELVE. THAT YEAR DOOR TWENTY STILL BIRDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISEASE. HALF OF THE INTENTIONAL SYPHILIS CASES OCCUR BECAUSE OF GAPS IN TESTING AND TREATMENT DURING PRENATAL CARE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE THAT GAP REQUIRING ADDITIONAL SCREENINGS. THIS BILL ALSO INCREASE ACCESS TO STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT BY OPENING UP ACCESS TO FAMILY PACKED PROGRAM. INCREASING THE USE OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY OPTION BY PROVIDERS AND PHARMACISTS. PERMITTING HIV COUNSELOR SAID MR RAPID STD TESTS REQUIRING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HOME STD TESTS. CALIFORNIA HAS LAGAN ENACTING COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES INCREASE ACCESS TO STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED STD RATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SB THREE A SIX STATES TO CONVERT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S STD CRISIS BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO STD CARE AND EQUITABLE WAY.
