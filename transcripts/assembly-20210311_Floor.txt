WHEN WE BUILD COALITIONS. I THINK WE GET MORE WHEN WE AGREE TO DISAGREE. ON POLICY BUT WHEN WE STILL TREAT PEOPLE AND THEY'RE DISTRICTS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR VALUE. WITH DIGNITY. THAT IS WHAT THIS BODY IS ABOUT. AND THAT IS WHAT CALIFORNIA DESERT. LEGISLATORS WHO CREATE POLICY. THINKING ABOUT THE BEST OF WHAT THE STATE CAN BE. AND HOW ARE DISTINCTIVE.
