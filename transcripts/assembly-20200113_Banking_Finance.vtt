00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:31.229
OBJECTIVE BUT IT DOES NOT COVER

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:32.230
PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS. IN THEORY

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.731
A HOMEOWNER CAN MAKE A PARTIAL

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.032
PREPAYMENT OF ONE DOLLAR. IT

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:36.567
WOULD COST ME A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:37.168
DOLLARS TO FILE THE PAPERWORK

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:38.503

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:52.383
GOOD FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION-

00:35:57.255 --> 00:35:58.656
MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS FOR

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:00.324
ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS AND TO

00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:02.693
FORCE US TO KILL A TREE TO

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.561
PRINT IT OUT AND SEND A FEW FED

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:29.220
IN TERMS OF IF IT IS A MANDATE

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:30.488
ON HELPING THE PAPER DOCUMENTS

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:32.056
SENT TO YOU THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:32.557
OR THE CLIENT WOULD BE

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.659
PRECLUDED FROM HAVING. THE

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:38.229
OPPORTUNITY TO GO PAPERLESS.

00:36:38.296 --> 00:36:39.163
THE ANSWER IS YES SITE I

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.764
BELIEVE HAVING A HARD COPY IS

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.265
NECESSARY FOR CONSUMERS TO BE

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:41.832
PROTECTED IN LIGHT OF WHAT

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:42.533
WE'VE SEEN WITH THE OPTION TO

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.904
GO ELECTRONIC. MENTAL WHAT

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.105
ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:49.941
OPTION OF HAVING TO GO

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:52.677
PAPERLESS IN ADDITION TO THE

00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:54.712
OPTION OF GOING TO HAVE A HEART

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:57.782
PAPER COPY- FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

00:36:57.848 --> 00:36:58.416
WITH THEIR BEEN OPPORTUNITY IN

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.151
THE FUTURE I MEAN I'D GO

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:01.619
PAPERLESS FOR MY FINANCIAL

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:04.455

SAYING AND WE'VE CONSIDERED IT

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:10.394
IT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:12.863
WE'RE HERE AT A TO YOUR BILL-

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.032
BUT TO BE FAIR I THINK WE NEED

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:16.434
TO PLACE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.735
AT THE FOREFRONT TO DO TOO MUCH

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.670
OF THE FRAUD THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:22.640
AND BELIEVES THAT THE HARD COPY

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:23.874
BETTER ALLOWS US TO INSURE

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:26.477
THAT. BEYOND THE PERSON SEEKING

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:28.446

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:43.661
THE D. V. O. CURRENTLY

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:46.864
REGULATES. THIS TYPE OF POLICY.

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:47.732
IS IT NECESSARY FOR THE

00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:49.333
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A MANDATE.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.737
ON THIS SPECIFIC POLICY- NOW IF

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:53.738
THE TPO IS REGULATING IT AS A

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.172
STANCE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:57.375
THOSE REGULATIONS WILL BE FROM

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:00.071
MISSING IN THIS CONVERSATION

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:01.505
ALONG THE WAY AND IS THAT IS

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:01.939
THAT THERE ARE THEIR

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:02.640
COMMUNITIES LOWER ECONOMIC

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:04.308

WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL IN MY

00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:18.289
CITY. THAT ONE OF THE CAPSULES

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:20.124
OF GOVERNMENT CAME FORWARD

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.492
PRESENT THIS PACE PERMIT SO

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.160

THINGS IT'S GOING TO DO AND

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:26.197
THAT SAYING CAME TO MIND THAT

00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:26.831
IF SOMETHING SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:27.898
BE TRUE IT PROBABLY IS AND

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:30.301
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.269
WITH THIS IT'S MARK I DIDN'T

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:32.803
VOTE FOR IT I WAS ON CITY

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.004

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:37.174
THAT SAYS. DOESN'T SEEM AN EYE

00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:39.310
AS RIGHT AND WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:39.877
CAN'T SELL THEIR HOMES WE

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.278
PEOPLE WHO ARE STUCK IN THIS

00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:45.683
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IT'S A

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.250
SHAME AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:49.620
WHAT TO DO O. THE REQUIREMENT

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:51.122
THEY GET IT IN A PAPER FORM. I

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:51.756
DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT BIG OF

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:53.424
A DEAL ON. TREES A RENEWABLE

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:54.525

FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE RECORDS.

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.598
I THINK IT'S- DIFFICULT FOR

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.032
PEOPLE IF IT'S THREE YEARS

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:03.501
LATER TO GO BACK AND TRY TO

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.547
LONG TIME- HAS BEEN THE

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.682
CONTROVERSIAL AND DOES SOME ME

I'M PRESENTING THAT ISSUES. AND

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:58.689
THAT THESE ARE THE WAYS OF TO

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:01.659
PROTECT. THE CONSUMERS WHO ARE

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:04.395
MORE VULNERABLE IN THE LOWER

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:06.564
ECONOMIC ASH ABOUT AND-

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.665
ORIGINALLY I HAD THAT SAME

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:10.467
QUESTION WHY MANDATING PRINTED

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:13.103

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.072
BUT THAT NOW LISTENING TO YOU

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IS SOMEONE

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:35.059
THING- BUT THE CONSUMER

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:38.095

THIS IS ALL MORE. OVERWHELMING.

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.704

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:43.961
TWENTY SEVENTEEN BILL WAS

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:45.095
ACTUALLY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THE

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:46.330

SUBJECT TO- THE TWENTY

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:55.439
SEVENTEEN BILL AND SO I THINK

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:56.473
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS BILL

00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:00.778
MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS- AND

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:02.613

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:24.434
OF THE CONSUMER AS THE

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.135
DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE GONE ON

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:27.537
WITH THE CAN CONSULT AND WITH.

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.205
THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE CAN. THAT

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:31.708
IS A CREATURE OF FEDERAL LAW

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:33.142
FEDERAL LAW SPECIFICALLY A

BOTTOM OF THE PILE. ANY

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.452
COMMUNICATION THEY RECEIVE.

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.320
DIRECTLY FROM A CAN CONSUMER

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:46.256
SERVICES ORGANIZATION AS

OPPOSED TO FROM THE CONSUMER

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:50.293
WHICH MEANS IN THAT INSTANCE.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:50.894
THAT BY PUTTING AT THE BOTTOM

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.696
OF THE PILE. IT'S INCLUDED

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.765
LEVEL BE RESPONDED TO SO

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:56.933
BECAUSE OF THAT PROVISION

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.369
FEDERAL LAW THE COMMUNICATION

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:00.904
IS DONE IN SUCH A WAY. TO

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:03.473
ENSURE THAT IT IS OPENED BY THE

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.508
DEBT COLLECTOR AND RESPONDED

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:07.810
TO. BY THE DEBT COLLECTOR WE

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:09.212
ARE NOT AS THE LANGUAGE OF THE

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.648
BILL AND WE TALKED REYES AND

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.181
BODY UNDERSTAND VERY WELL

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:17.820
IMPERSONATE. THE CUSTOMER. WE

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:18.321
HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:18.788
CUSTOMER THE CUSTOMER

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.890
UNDERSTANDS. WHY WERE

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:23.526
COMMUNICATING AND UNDERSTANDS

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.161
THAT WE NEED TO DO SO IN A

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:26.529
FASHION INSURERS AN ADEQUATE

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:30.300
RESPONSE. AND SO THAT IS

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:32.702
PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST OBJECTION-

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:34.203
I UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.572
GRAYSON HAS NOT COMMITTED TO AN

00:59:36.639 --> 00:59:38.841
AMENDMENT ON IT HE WANTS TO GET

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.343
IT RIGHT AND WE WANT HIM TO GET

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:44.580
IT RIGHT. SO WE OPPOSE THIS

00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:47.317
BILL AS IT IS. AND BELIEVE THAT.

00:59:47.383 --> 00:59:49.218
I THINK BY FIVE TO THREE MARGIN

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:50.586
IN THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT

00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:52.956
ARE- IDENTIFIED BY THE

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:55.491
COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. THAT ARE

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:56.826
THERE ARE THREE GENERAL

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:58.194
STATEMENTS HE MAKES ABOUT WHAT

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.028
IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.230
CONSUMERS WE ARE VERY MUCH

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:02.298
INTERESTED IN WORKING ON THOSE.

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.067
THE FIVE THERE IN THE BEST.

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:05.268
INTEREST OF THE DEBT COLLECTOR

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:06.736
NOT SO MUCH BUT WE WILL

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.471
CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:09.973
WELL IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:13.009
FORWARD. NOW I. MY CLIENT CAN

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.611
ANSWER QUESTIONS WERE PROVIDE

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:16.846
JAPAN IT'S ON HOW OUR BUSINESS

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:20.149
WORKS BUT BUT BECAUSE PERHAPS

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:20.583
THAT WILL. BE A BIT

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:25.355
ENLIGHTENING TO THE MEMBERS.

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:25.922
WELL SENSITIVE TO THE PEOPLE

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:30.026
BEHIND ME AND. RIGHT AND I HAVE

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.161
A LOT IN THIS ONE FOR AWHILE.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.364
AGAIN MIKE MY APOLOGIES THROW

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.998
SOMETHING THAT MAY I NEVER COME

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.667
A MISSING SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:38.668
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.371
UNDERSTAND THE SPACE THAT WE

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:44.173
WORK IN- BECAUSE UNLESS SOMEONE

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.009
HAS HAD THE UNFORTUNATE

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.844
EXPERIENCE OF DEALING WITH

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.846
CREDIT REPORTING ISSUES IT'S

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:52.081
OFTEN AN AREA THAT MANY OF US

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:55.385
ARE BLIND TO. PEOPLE WHO AND TO

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:59.055
COME TO US. ON AVERAGE IF WE

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.156
WERE JUST TO PICK OUT THE

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:03.960
TYPICAL PERSON THEY WOULD HAVE.

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:06.162
PROBABLY TEN TRADE LINES ON

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:07.530
EACH OF THEIR THREE CREDIT

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:09.499
REPORTS THAT MEANS THEY'RE

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:12.735
DEALING WITH- AS MANY AS THIRTY

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:15.038
ITEMS ON THEIR CREDIT REPORTS

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:17.440
THEY ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.808
WHAT THEY MEAN WHAT THEIR

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.911
IMPACT IS AND WHAT OPTIONS THEY

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:22.445
HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:26.716
ITEMS. UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THE

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:29.052
SAME TRADE LINE DOES NOT ALWAYS

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:32.422
APPEAR WITH THE SAME NAME- IT'S

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:34.857
OFTEN TRUE THAT BALANCES DO NOT

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:35.992
LINE UP BETWEEN THE THREE

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:37.493
CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.563
BECAUSE- OF TIMING DIFFERENCES.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.232
AND SO PEOPLE WHO COME TO US.

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:46.235
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT COME TO US

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:49.272
WITH QUESTIONS. AND THEY ARE IN

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.140
A LOOK THEY ARE LOOKING TO US

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.676
TO PROVIDE THEM SOME EXPERIENCE

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.478
SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP SOME

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.846
GUIDANCE AND HELP THEM

01:01:56.913 --> 01:02:01.084
UNDERSTAND OPTIONS. THAT COMES

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:04.320
IN TWO FORMS ONE IS TALKING

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:05.521
ABOUT THE ITEMS THAT

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:07.323
SPECIFICALLY APPEAR ON THE

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.392
CREDIT REPORT WHAT IMPACT THEY

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.693
MIGHT HAVE UNDERSTANDING THE

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.463
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY HAVE LED

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:16.199
TO- THOSE CREDIT REPORTING

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:19.135
ITEMS AND OFTEN PEOPLE. DO NOT

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.104
NECESSARILY RECOGNIZE ITEMS ON

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.040
THEIR CREDIT REPORT THAT'S.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.075
OFTEN MORE TRUE IN THE CASE OF

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:29.145
COLLECTIONS BECAUSE- CONSUMERS

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.546
DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:31.380
THEIR DEBT COLLECTOR IT'S AT

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:34.183
THEIR NOT CHOOSING TO GO- TO A

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:37.153
PARTICULAR ENTITY AND SO- IT

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.056
MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZABLE- IT

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:43.359
ALSO CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.829
FOR THEM BECAUSE- DEBT TENDS TO

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.565
MOVE FROM ONE COLLECTOR TO

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.901
ANOTHER AND SO THE SAME DEBT-

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.403
ME. GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.071
COLLECTORS AND A NUMBER OF

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:58.174
COLLECTION PROCESSES AGAIN THE

01:02:58.241 --> 01:02:59.709
BOTTOM LINE HERE IS IT MEANS

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.611
THAT THE CONSUMER MAY NOT

01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:03.846
RECOGNIZE. ITEMS ON THEIR

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:06.249
CREDIT REPORT AND NEED HELP IN

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:08.351
INVESTIGATING UNDERSTANDING THE

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:08.851
BASIS FOR THEIR CREDIT

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:11.187
REPORTING- THEY MAY NOT

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.256
UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS- THEIR

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.991
SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR A

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:18.094
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY- WE SEE

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.096
PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH DIVORCE

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:21.831
CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE ARE OFTEN

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:23.833
VERY COMPLICATED CREDIT

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.069
REPORTING CIRCUMSTANCES- WE

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.805
HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:31.474
ABOUT STUDENT LENDING-

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.010
SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE- MEDIA

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.811
CURRENTLY. PEOPLE FREQUENTLY

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.547
HAVE A CONCERNS ABOUT MEDICAL

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:39.182
DEBT AND WHY IT APPEARS ON

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.217
THEIR CREDIT REPORT AND THEY

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.085
MAY BE BATTLING IT OUT WITH AN

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:46.289
INSURER- AND SO ALL OF THE

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:49.258
CIRCUMSTANCES LEAD TO US. AN

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:50.693
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK SOME

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.129
QUESTIONS ON THEIR BEHALF AND

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:54.964
PRIMARILY THAT'S WHAT WE DO

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:56.465
WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ON THEIR

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.433
BEHALF WHY IT IS ON THE CREDIT

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.769
REPORT. WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:03.372
IT TO APPEAR- BECAUSE THAT

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:04.440
UNDERSTANDING IS CRITICAL TO

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:07.944
THEM BEING ABLE TO TAKE ACTION.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:11.414

THEY DO TO PUT POSITIVE HISTORY

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:19.689
DOWN AND SO WE WORK WITH THEM
