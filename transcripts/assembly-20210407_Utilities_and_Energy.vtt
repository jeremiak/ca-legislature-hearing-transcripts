QUESTIONS. DR WORK- THANK YOU

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:50.372
CHAIR SO A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:52.307
SPOKE ABOUT A BILL THAT NO

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:55.277
LONGER EXISTS. WE'RE JUST

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:56.979
BASICALLY GOING TO POLITELY ASK

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:58.714
WHICH I'M SURE WILL NOT NEED A

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:03.886
WHOLE LOT. MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:07.122
IS THAT THE COST OF GETTING RID

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:09.158
OF THE FOREST BIOMASS. IS MUCH

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:12.428
HIGHER IF YOU'RE JUST USING IT

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:13.796
TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY IS

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.931
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AS

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.833
OPPOSED TO FIFTY DOLLARS FOR

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.469
SOLAR. SO IT'S FOUR TIMES AS

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.471
EXPENSIVE. IF WE DON'T DO

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:24.306
RESEARCH I MEAN WE ALREADY SAW

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:27.342
THE PREVIOUS BELL ARE FROM-

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:30.913
IDEA CURRY. THAT BASICALLY

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.816
NOBODY'S USED NOBODY'S TAKING

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.718
ADVANTAGE OF THESE FUNDS.

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.920
BECAUSE IT'S SO WHAT THE PRICE

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:41.924
IS SO HIGH OUR TO GENERATE

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.358
ELECTRICITY FROM BIOMASS. THE

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.494
PROBLEM I SEE IS THAT IT'S NOT

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.196
JUST A MATTER OF GENERATING

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:49.565
ELECTRICITY. THE PROBLEM HERE

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:50.966
IS WHAT YOU DO WITH THE BIO

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.568
MASS AND WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.703
ARE IF YOU DON'T DO THIS IT

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.973
BECOMES EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. TO

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.443
SAY TAKE IT AND- COME POSTED

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.044
SOMEWHERE IS THAT WE'RE GOING

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:05.080
TO DO. ARM OR YOU BURN IT IN

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:07.015
THE FEELS I REMEMBER WHAT IT

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.984
WAS LIKE WHEN THEY USED TO BURN

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.753
BIOMASS IN THE FIELDS FROM THE

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:13.856
FARMS-WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:15.624
AS WE MANAGE OUR FORESTS WITH

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.160
ALL THAT WASTE. THAT'S WHY WE

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:21.864
NEEDED THIS RESEARCH MONEY. AND

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.766
TO CHANGE TO A SIMPLE REQUEST.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.468
WHICH WILL BE IGNORED IN MY

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:29.772
OPINION. IS NOT A GOOD IDEA OF

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:30.939
COURSE ALL VOTE FOR THE BILL

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:33.208
WILL AT LEAST GET ON RECORD

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:37.112
THAT WE REQUESTED A SPOT. ARMED

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:38.580
WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN THIS WE

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:44.787
NEED A- COMPLETE. STRATEGY ON

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:48.056
HOW WE TREAT THE JYJ AMOUNTS OF

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:49.725
BIOMASS THAT ARE GENERATED IN

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:52.294
FARMING AND WILL BE GENERATED

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:54.363
BY OUR FORESTS MAYBE THIS

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:57.332
WASN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT I

01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:00.102
KNOW THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT LIE.

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.037
POLITICIANS CHOOSING

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.039
TECHNOLOGIES I UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:06.308
BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.677
I'LL BE WORKING WITH MISTER

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:11.547

DO SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO RUN

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.050
INTO MAJOR CONCERNS THIS IS NOT

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.152
JUST AN ENERGY ISSUE THIS IS A

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:19.655
MUCH WIDER. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:27.095

CHAIR HERE BUT I THINK- MY

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:46.849
COLLEAGUE MEMBER RAISES A VERY

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:49.484
IMPORTANT POINT. THAT THERE IS

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:54.156
MORE TO COST AND THEN- MERELY

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:56.658
THE CREATION OF THE ELECTRICITY-

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:58.393
I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL BUT

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.696
SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:03.165
IS AS WEAKENED AS IT IS. BUT MY

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:04.466
HOPE IS THAT IT WILL BEGIN A

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.669
CONVERSATION. AND I HOPE THAT-

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:09.471

ACROSS OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT

STILL UTILIZE OUR PRACTICE- BIO

MASS. AT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:18.340
BEING EXPLORED HAS BEEN ONE OF

THOSE AREAS THAT- IS BELIEVED

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:24.379

WE TRULY WANT TO GET TO A PLACE

WHAT IS A- ANTIQUATED PROCESS

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:34.056
AN IMPORTANT ONE- FARMERS WOULD

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:38.226

YEAR'S CROPS BUT NEVER THE

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:46.868
LESS. A SIGNIFICANTLY HARMFUL.

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.337
PRACTICE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.172
PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF

01:16:50.238 --> 01:16:51.306
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:54.076
AREAS I KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:56.645
HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED SB SIX ONE

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:57.779
SEVEN COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY

01:16:57.846 --> 01:16:59.381
DOLLS THAT ARE WITHIN THE RURAL

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.283
FARMING PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.553
PRIORITIZED THE BANNING OF-

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:07.756
BURNING A FIELD AND THAT.

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.992
BIOMASS NOT EVERYONE BUT SOME

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:12.194
COMMUNITIES OF SAID THAT

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.596
POTENTIALLY BIOMASS COULD BE.

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:15.464
ONE OF THOSE SOLUTIONS SO I

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.777
PATH WAY TO ADDRESSING THAT

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:30.412
ISSUE THAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.319
BE CONCERNED THAT. IT APPEARS

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:19.554
THAT THE BILL EVEN THOUGH IT

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:22.357

OUR WHICH ACCORDING TO THE

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:52.287
ORIGINAL A BILL IT LOOKS LESS.

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:54.523
SOME CARBON EMITTING ALL

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:56.691
SOURCES AS THE AS ALTERNATIVES

01:19:56.758 --> 01:20:00.929
AND SO. I AM JUST OF A RAISING

GUN MY CONCERNS AND- AND FOR

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:06.668

WORK THAT MR SALAS IS DOING IN

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:27.122

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:28.890
ENVIRONMENTAL LAST AND HAVE ONE

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:29.958

RECORDS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.361
YET WE HAVE TO BE REAL ABOUT

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:34.396
WHAT IS HAPPENING AND I THINK

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.298
THAT IS WHAT MR MURATSUCHI JUST

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.099
TOUCHED ON WHICH IS WE ARE

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.968
HAVING TO CENTER FOREST BECAUSE

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.203
AS WE ALL KNOW ONE OF THE

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.471
LARGEST EMISSIONS SOURCES RIGHT

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:45.740
NOW IS OUR WILDFIRES. AND THE

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.175
TOXIC AIR THAT IS COMING TO ALL

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:48.109
OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER YOU

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.377
LIVE IN ONE OF THESE HIGH FIRE

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:52.547
GUNS OR NOT IS POISONING OUR

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:54.616
CHILDREN AND SO WE'RE DOING THE

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:56.284
WORK TO PREVENT THAT AND THAT

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.719
IS LEADING TO BIOMASS THERE ARE

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.221
OTHER SOURCES OF BIOMASS THAT

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:00.622
ARE OCCURRING IN OUR STATE WE

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.691
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.059
AND AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS THIS

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:06.294
WHICH- ALTHOUGH YES CREATING

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:07.829
EMISSIONS CONTAINS A LARGE

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:08.830
PORTION OF IT ESPECIALLY AS

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:11.199
COMPARED TO OPEN BURNING OR THE

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:11.766
WILD FIRES IF WE DON'T DO

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.969
ANYTHING. SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:15.303
POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE AND I

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:16.504
THINK THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:18.807
NEED TO DO AND I AGREE WITH DR

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:20.976
QUIRK THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:21.643
WORK AND WE NEED TO BE

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.011
AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT AND WE TO

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.045
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.447
CLIMATE CHANGE WITH EVERY

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:27.349
SINGLE TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX AND

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:29.317
THAT MEANS LOOKING AT WHAT IS

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:30.485
THE ALTERNATIVE IF WE DON'T DO

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.120
THAT AND THE ALTERNATIVE TO NOT

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.855
DOING THIS IS WORSE FOR OUR

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.991
CLIMATE AND SO THAT IS WHAT IS

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.759
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:39.494
ME TO STAND UP AND SAY I'M NOT

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.595
GOING TO SUPPORT THE POSITION

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.930
OF THE SIERRA CLUB HERE I THINK

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:43.632
THIS IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE.

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.267
AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:49.371
BILL AND I WISH. WE WERE DOING

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:50.005
MORE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD THANK

THE COMMENTS WILL DIRECT THAT

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:57.196
SMALL BUSINESSES TRYING TO GET

I'M SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:03.636
BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW THE

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:05.238
REASON WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:07.240
THIS WAY AND I'M VERY CONCERNED

01:59:07.306 --> 01:59:12.945

01:59:18.618 --> 01:59:20.386
OUR COLLEAGUE LET ME FIRST SAY

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:22.722
A FEW THINGS- THIS BILL HAS

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:24.223
BEEN AMENDED ORIGINALLY WE HAD

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:26.058
PROPOSED TO USE 85% OF THE

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:28.861
CLIMATE CREDIT- BUT- AT THE

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:29.595
GOOD SUGGESTION OF THE

01:59:29.662 --> 01:59:31.664
COMMITTEE CHAIR- WE ARE TALKING

01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:33.533
ABOUT 5% OF CLIMATE CREDIT.

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:34.967
JUST TO. TELL EVERYONE WHAT

01:59:35.034 --> 01:59:36.269
THAT MOUTH TURNS OUT TO BE IT'S

01:59:36.335 --> 01:59:38.037
ABOUT TWO DOLLARS AND SEVENTY

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:39.739
CENTS. FOR EVERY RATE PAYER

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:41.307
WHO'S NOT LOW INCOME SO COMES

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:42.842
OUT TO ABOUT TWENTY TWO AND A

01:59:42.909 --> 01:59:44.176
HALF CENTS PER PER MONTH SO I

01:59:44.243 --> 01:59:45.945
JUST WANT TO. PUT THAT IN IN

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:47.513
SCALE- CERTAINLY THERE IS

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.315
NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:52.718
CREATES- ANY REQUIREMENT- ON

01:59:52.785 --> 01:59:53.886
THE STATE OR THE COST AROUND

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:55.154
COMMUNITY OUTREACH WHAT WE'RE

HAVE COMMUNITY CENTERS AND

02:00:02.194 --> 02:00:03.729
COMMUNITY HOGS. THAT ARE

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:04.964
DEFENSIBLE AGAINST CLIMATE

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:06.599
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU HAD

02:00:06.666 --> 02:00:08.267
WILDFIRES AND HAD SMOKING AND

02:00:08.334 --> 02:00:09.936

02:00:19.812 --> 02:00:21.714
PART OF MONEY. TO BE ABLE TO

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:24.483
FIRST MAKE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:25.551

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:47.146

ON- AND ADMITTEDLY IT'S AN

02:05:16.242 --> 02:05:20.112
AMBITIOUS- PLAN- BUT I THINK

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:30.689
INCREASE OF WILDFIRES AND

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:32.524

TO WEIGH IN ON IT DID JUST A

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:55.981
QUICK POINT OF A CLARIFICATION

02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:57.249
I KNOW MY OFFICE HAD REACHED

02:05:57.316 --> 02:06:00.052

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:01.787
COLLEAGUE'S OFFICE REGARDING

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:04.690
THE- DEFINITION I KNOW THAT

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:05.491
THERE'S A DEFINITION AROUND

02:06:05.557 --> 02:06:08.193
DISADVANTAGED COMMUITIES AND

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:10.262
USUALLY WE'VE ASKED THE PAST TO

02:06:10.329 --> 02:06:12.164
HAVE- THE DEFINITION AROUND LOW

02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:13.132
INCOME COMMUNITIES AS PART OF

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:15.000

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.369
USING THE DEFINITION OF

VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WITH

02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:21.874
THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING

TO BE- REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION

02:06:23.909 --> 02:06:24.810
BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCERN IN

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:26.278
THE PAST WAS THAT DISADVANTAGED

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:27.846

I JUST WANTED TO JUST ASK A

02:06:36.755 --> 02:06:38.190
POINT OF CLARIFICATION AND SEE

02:06:46.665 --> 02:06:47.733
COMMUNITIES- DEFINITION IT WAS

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.001

HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY

02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:05.484
CLIMATE CRISIS SO WE DO- BASED

02:07:05.551 --> 02:07:06.719

TO THE IMPORTANCE OF GEOGRAPHIC
