01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.194
WITH OUR OWN TWO EYES.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:00.863
NO TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WE SAW

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.932
THE VIDEO AND LA OF RODNEY KING

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.266

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.834
WHEN YOU SAW SOMEONE TAKING A

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:07.002
HOME VIDEO.

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:09.171

YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:25.054
PARSING THE WORDS AS FAR AS

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.723
REASONABLE WHEN NECESSARY AND

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.258
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS BECAUSE

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:30.859
OF THIS LAW POLICE DEPARTMENTS

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.661

FOCUSING ON DE ESCALATION

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.501
ALTERNATIVE TACTICS TO DO THEIR

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:42.905
JOBS KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:43.205

IN THE STATE BUDGET TO IMPLEMENT

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:48.811
THESE PRACTICES WE ALSO THE

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.980
COMPANION BILL WHICH DEALS WITH

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.915

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:53.749
REALLY IS ABOUT.

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:56.185
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DE ESCALATION.

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:58.988
AND I KNOW THAT 99% OF THE TIME

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:01.890
LAW OFFICERS DO THEIR JOB.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.158
BUT EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THERE'S

A 1% WEATHER IS NOT

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.495
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.697
WE'VE SEEN THAT IN LOS ANGELES

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:11.000
LAST YEAR AN INDIVIDUAL POLICE

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:13.502
OFFICER SHOT AN INDIVIDUAL.

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.537
IN THE BACK A HOMELESS MAN I

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.106
BELIEVE IN YOUR DISTRICT.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.374
THE POLICE CHIEF OF THE CITY OF

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.676
LA THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.311

BE FIRED.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.514
AND PROSECUTED THE POLICE CHIEFS

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:26.882

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.751
RARE OCCURRENCE.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.052
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I

HERE IN SACRAMENTO. FIFTY MILES

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:40.396
DOWN THE ROAD A RANCH RECORD OF

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.064
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAD

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.033

THE ACTIVITIES PUT THE PUBLIC AT

01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:00.215
RISK IT WAS UNNECESSARY AND

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.084
THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:02.651
GOING ABOUT IT.

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.119
BUT AGAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:05.954
SAID.

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:07.623
THE LAW SAYS WE CAN'T HOLD

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.158
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS INSTANCE

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:10.459

JOB BUT WHEN THERE IS SOMEBODY

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:18.901
DOES CROSS THE LINE THERE SHOULD

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.469
BE ACCOUNTABILITY SO THIS IS

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:21.704

LEGISLATION.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.688

THE DECISION BY A POLICE BY A

OFFICER IN THE SAME SITUATION.

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.292
BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:31.960
CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO OR

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:33.728
PERCEIVED BY THE OFFICER AT THE

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:34.796
TIME.

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.231
RATHER THAN WITH THE BENEFIT OF

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:37.666
HINDSIGHT.

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:40.068
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT.

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:41.803
IT SHOULD NOT BE TO THIRD

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.705

IN THESE HIGHLY DANGEROUS

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.881
SITUATIONS.

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:54.282
IT HAS TO BE FROM THE

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:55.417
PERSPECTIVE OF A TRAINED

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:55.717
[inaudible]

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:57.686
REASONABLE.

01:20:57.752 --> 01:21:01.389

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.525
MAJORITY [inaudible]

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.126
SUPERMAJORITY.

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:07.329
OF OUR OFFICERS ARE WELL TRAINED

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:08.663
AND THEY HANDLE THEMSELVES WITH

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:09.864
CIVILIANS.

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:12.200
SAFELY AND THEY DO IT HONORABLY

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.835
AND THEY PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:16.404

IN THIS STANDARD RECOGNIZES THAT.

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.042

COME ENSURES THAT THERE IS

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.746
PROPER TRAINING.

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:26.915
THAT WE EXPAND UPON OUR TRAINING.

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:29.351
SO THIS BILL I BELIEVE.

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.386
WITH THE COMPROMISES MADE.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.854

NO.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.960
BUT THIS IS HOW POLICY SHOULD BE

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:39.894
DONE.

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:44.966
BY SITTING DOWN BY A COMPROMISE.

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.534
AND THE AUTHOR LISTEN TO THE THE

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:48.169
VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OF OUR

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:56.144
LIKE WE HAVE THE STUFF ON CLERK

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:56.444

SHOULD BE KILLED THIS IS THE

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:17.499
KIND OF RHETORIC THE GOING.

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.034
THAT IS CAUSING MORE MORE

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.370
DIVISION AND VIOLENCE.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.538
BUT I WAS THERE AND I SAID THIS

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:26.274
VOTE FOLKS I SAID [inaudible]

STUFF ON CLARK'S MOTHER.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.816
AS IT IS FOR THE MOTHER OF

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:36.818
NATALIE CORONA [inaudible]

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:38.653

THEY'LL NEVER GET BACK.

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.458
AND THAT'S WHY I SING COMMITTEE

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:44.559
WE DO SOMETHING THAT DOES

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.561
SOMETHING FOR BOTH.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:49.764
THEY PROTECT BOTH SIDES.

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:51.733
IN A POLICY THAT JUST TRIES TO

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.001
PUSH THROUGH AND STEAM STEAM

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:54.169
ROLL THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:57.138
EQUATION IS NOT A FAIR POLICY IT

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:58.473
IS THE DUTY OF THE LEGISLATOR.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.008
OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS JUST

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:02.210
LAWS.

REASONABLE COMPROMISE.

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:09.117
IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:11.419
PROTECTS THE LIVES OF OFFICERS

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:12.987
AND THE LIVES OF THE PUBLIC

WET MILE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER --

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:34.976
I'VE SEEN OUR WORK ON THIS FROM

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:37.078
FROM THE DEEPEST PART OF HER

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:38.246
SOUL.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.582
AN ISSUE THAT SO FEW PEOPLE

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.283
WOULD TAKE ON I WANT TO BE CLEAR

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.952
BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY GOOD

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:45.320
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PEACE

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:46.855
OFFICERS.

YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN ONE WAS SHOT

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:49.657
MY DISTRICT WE NEED TO BRIDGE

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:51.860
AFTER -- WE UNDERSTAND WE MOURN

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:54.162
WE PROSECUTE THOSE.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:55.797
WHO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR AND

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:56.965
THIS ISN'T?

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:59.167
THIS BILL ISN'T NECESSARILY

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:02.003
ABOUT BOTH SIDES WE WE DO THAT

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:04.873
TYPE OF HONORING AS WE SHOULD.

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:06.307
BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.709
COMMUNITIES WE LIVE IN.

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.010
WHEN I FIRST GOT TO LEGISLATURE

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:10.478
USED TO TELL PEOPLE I DIDN'T

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.746
HEAR A LOT ABOUT POLICE

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.381
BRUTALITY MY DISTRICT AND I

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:14.883
DIDN'T?

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:15.517
I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE BORDER

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:16.384
PATROL.

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:17.752
I HEARD A LOT ABOUT BORDER

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.988
PATROL SHOOTINGS.

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.856
BUT OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS IT'S

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.258
LIKE THERE'S BEEN SUCH A CHANGE

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:25.593
THAT EVEN AND AND MY COMMUNITY.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.961
WHICH DOESN'T ALWAYS IT SEE THE

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:29.697
REALITY OF BROWN FOLKS BEING THE

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:32.066
SAME SUBJECT OF POLICE BRUTALITY

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:33.067
IS BLACK FOLKS.

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:35.036
THAT HAS CHANGED.

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:37.472
AND WE LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.040
PEOPLE ARE IN FEAR IN THE SAME

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.542
WAY WE USED TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.410
BEING FEAR NOT CALLING POLICE

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:43.778
BECAUSE POLICE MY CALL

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.146
IMMIGRATION.

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:46.181
WE HAVE PEOPLE BEING IF YOU'RE

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:47.348
NOT CALLING POLICE BECAUSE

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.716
THEY'RE AFRAID.

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.518
THAT THAT PERSON MIGHT GET

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.020
SHOCKED.

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:54.355
OR THAT THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BE

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:56.991
MISTAKEN AND BE SHOT.

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:59.394
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:02.297
UNARMED INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS.

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.765
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE BY POLICE

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:06.801
OFFICERS.

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:09.270
OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS THIS BILL TO

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:10.839
REBUILD THAT TRUST THAT'S

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:14.809
NECESSARY TO KEEP US ALL SAFE.

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:15.910
I THINK DOCTOR WEBER I'M SORRY

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:17.278
MY COLLEAGUE.

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:19.747
FROM ACROSS THE ROAD.

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:22.984
STRUCK THE PERFECT BALANCE.

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.919
SHE ADAMANTLY AS PROTECTING A

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:27.355
COMMUNITY THE DESERVES THAT

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:28.523
PROTECTION.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.091
SHE'S PROVIDING A VOICE FOR A

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.827
COMMUNITY THAT FOR TOO LONG.

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:34.996
HAS BEEN STIFLED.

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:36.798
AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WORKED

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:38.633
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.834
AND WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.336
THERE'S TRAINING.

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:42.537
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:44.005
IN THIS BODY TO ENSURE THAT

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.173
THERE'S ADEQUATE RESOURCES FOR

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.774
THAT TRAINING.

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.510
BECAUSE CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:49.844
JUST BY LAW.

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.646
IT HAS TO HAPPEN BY THE WAY

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:52.881
PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO IMPLEMENT

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:54.415
THAT LAW.

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.985
SO TODAY I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.186
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:00.288
IN OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THE

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:01.956
HARD WORK -- THAT OUR COLLEAGUE

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.625
HAS DONE IT WE DO THE RIGHT

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:05.793
THING FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.795
THAT WE MEET ALL FEEL SAFE WHEN

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:08.730
WE CALL THE POLICE.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:09.764
THAT WE MAY ALL HAVE A

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.132
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PEACE

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:13.935
OFFICERS OF ONE THAT WE BELIEVE.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.471
IT IS IS PURSUING SAFETY FOR ALL

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:18.506
OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.423
THE MOST IMPORTANT I HAVE A ONE

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.574

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.877
BUT ALSO REMOVES THAT FEAR.

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:45.012
THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:46.781

LIGHTS ARE BEHIND.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.162
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.363
LAW ENFORCEMENT STILL HAS THE

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.232
FEAR THAT IF THEY STOP SOMEONE

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:05.933
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.502

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:15.990
WHO'S BEEN IN COMBAT SITUATIONS.

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:19.927
WHO KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS? TO HAVE

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.163
TO DRAW WEAPON OUT ON SOMEBODY.

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:24.966
TO ASK THEM TO STOP. TO ASK THEM

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:26.968
TO FREEZE.

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.836
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:30.738
TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:33.674
I DON'T KNOW ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:35.676
IN THAT I'VE EVER MET THAT I'VE

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.845
EVER TALKED TO YOU.

01:33:37.912 --> 01:33:38.946
THAT WAKES UP IN THE MORNING AND

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.381
SAYS I WANT TO GET UP AND GO

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:42.516
SHOOT SOMEBODY.

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:44.151
NO THEY GET UP IN THE MORNING.

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:47.021
THEY KISS THEIR FAMILIES GOODBYE.

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:47.855
THE DROP THEIR KIDS OFF AT

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.657
SCHOOL.

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.859
AND THEN THEY GO ON PATROL.

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:52.960
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:54.795
PROTECTING AND SERVING.

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.931
OFFICE.

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.766
AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WE

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:02.003
HAVE A DUTY. TO REALIZE THAT THE

01:34:02.069 --> 01:34:05.039
WORDS THAT WE SAY.

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:08.409
CHANGE HOW SOCIETY IN THE PEOPLE

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.511
WE REPRESENT [inaudible]

01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:12.646
LOOK IT.

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:15.750
WHAT HAPPENS ON THE DAY TO DAY?

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:16.384
BECAUSE WHEN WE GO OUT THERE AND

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.919
TELL THEM FEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.021
THEY'RE GONNA BELIEVE THAT LIKE

01:34:20.087 --> 01:34:21.856
GOSPEL.

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:23.324
WHEN WE GET OUT?

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:24.625
AND WE SAY.

01:34:24.692 --> 01:34:25.926
NO WE NEED TO WORK AND HAVE A

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:26.994
PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LAW

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:29.196
ENFORCEMENT THEY BELIEVE THAT

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:30.698
MEMBERS WHAT WE TELL OUR

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:31.899
COMMUNITIES.

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:34.301
IS WHAT THEY TURN AROUND AND DO.

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:35.669
BECAUSE THEY LOOK TO US FOR THAT

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:38.039
LEADERSHIP.

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:40.508
NOW I WANT TO THANK.

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.743
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND ALL

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.879
OF THE WORK THAT SHE'S DON.

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:47.081
AND THE ART OF COMPROMISE.

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:49.283
IN GETTING THEIR BECAUSE THAT

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.118
SHOWS.

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:52.720
TRUE VALUE AS A LEGISLATURE IT

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.655
SHOWS THAT.

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:55.923
AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICOLAS

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.724
SAID WORK.

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:57.858
SHE'S NOT TRYING TO STEAMROLL

01:34:57.925 --> 01:35:00.494
THIS BILL.

01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:02.196
BUT I THINK THAT AS THIS MOVES

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:03.998
FORWARD WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:05.800
OTHER SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION.

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:07.802
AND REALLY SAY WHAT ARE WE DOING

01:35:07.868 --> 01:35:10.104
AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO BRING

01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:12.740
THAT.

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:16.077
COMMUNICATION THAT RESPECTS.

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:18.746
BACK TO OUR CHILDREN.

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:21.182
SO THEY KNOW DON'T FEAR THE

01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:23.350
OFFICERS THEY'RE THERE TO HELP.

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:25.453
WE SHOULD LOOK TO THEM WE SHOULD

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:28.089
RESPECT THEM.

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:29.590
AND WHEN THEY PULL YOU OVER FOR

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.292
THEY TELL YOU TO STOP.

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.961
FOLLOW THEIR INSTRUCTIONS THEY

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:36.097
SHOULDN'T BE A MATTER OF FEAR.

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:37.465
IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF

01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:39.166
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:41.836
IN TEACHING OUR NEXT GENERATION.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:44.071
THAT IT'S OKAY.

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:44.672
HOW YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE A TAIL

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:45.339
LIGHT OUT?

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:48.209
YOU DON'T KNOW.

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:49.310
BUT WE NEED TO TEACH THAT

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:51.412
RESPECT AND GRAIN THAT BACK INTO

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:53.614
OUR CHILDREN AND WE'VE LOST IT

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:55.716
WHICH IS LED US TO THIS POINT

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:57.251

PERSISTENCE HAS BROUGHT THIS

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.211
BILL TO US TODAY.

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:26.180
AND IN FACT IT'S BàN

01:36:26.247 --> 01:36:27.748
CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR SHOULD

01:36:27.815 --> 01:36:29.583
HAVE HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.118
DIDN'T BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.286
OF FEAR TO COME TO THE TABLE

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:33.954
ABOUT WHAT THIS REPRESENTED.

01:36:34.021 --> 01:36:35.689
A LOT OF BULLYING.

01:36:35.756 --> 01:36:37.525
AT A PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY DON'T

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:38.626
HAVE TO TAKE THIS CHANGE

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:41.328
SERIOUSLY THIS BODY TODAY I HOPE

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:43.931

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.232
LOT OF QUESTION WHETHER.

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:47.001
THIS BILL GOES FAR ENOUGH IN

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:48.502
SETTING THE STANDARD.

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:49.470
LEGITIMATE PART OF THE

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.038
CONVERSATION BUT WHAT'S

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:53.073
SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE BILL TODAY

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.309
BEFORE US AND IT WILL RESONATE

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.745
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IS THIS IS

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.313
ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS IS A

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.949
STATE WIDE LEVEL TO SAY WE NEED

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:02.783
TO CHANGE.

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.051
THE OUTCOMES OF WHAT HAS BEEN

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.419
HAPPENING.

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:06.587
IS NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.822
STATISTICS WHO'S ON THE OTHER

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:11.358
END WHEN A POLICE OFFICER PULLED

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:13.360
THAT TRIGGER PRIMARILY YOUNG MEN.

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:16.630
BLACK AND BROWN.

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:19.266
AND UNTIL WE TAKE THE NEXT STEPS

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.435
AFTER THIS BILL AND BELIEVE ME

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:22.803
THIS BILL SETS A STANDARD.

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:25.005
BUT OPENS UP THE CONVERSATIONS

01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:26.740
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN NEXT WHICH

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:28.676
IS WHAT TO OUR POLICE FORCES

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:29.677
LOOK WHY.

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:31.245
DO THEY LOOK LIKE THE REST OF

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:32.813
OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.048
CURRENTLY THEY DON'T.

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:35.983
AND UNLESS WE ENHANCE NOT JUST

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:37.985
TRAINING BUT GO BACK INTO THE

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:40.054
STANDARDS OF WHO'S ACCEPTABLE TO

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.922
BE ABLE TO APPLY TO BE A POLICE

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:42.623
OFFICER

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.758
WHO WERE WILLING TO HAVE IN

01:37:44.825 --> 01:37:46.293
THOSE FORCES THE INTERNAL

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.996
CULTURES WON'T CHANGE?

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:50.431
WE ALSO NEED TO HOLD AND THIS

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:51.966
COMES FROM POLICE CHIEFS IN MY

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.667
DISTRICT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.369
WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:55.836
HOLDING POLICE CHIEFS

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:58.038
ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE CULTURE

01:37:58.105 --> 01:37:59.173
CREATED IN THEIR OWN

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.474
ORGANIZATION.

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.742
SO THESE ARE AMONG THE NEXT

01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:03.978
STEPS THAT ULTIMATELY NEED TO

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:04.211
HAPPEN.

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:05.279
BUT THAT.

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:06.614
THIS BILL REPRESENTS A

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.349
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND A

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:10.784
WILLINGNESS TO MAKE A CHANGE IN

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:12.953
THE STANDARD FOR WHAT'S EXPECTED

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.922
IN THE USE OF FORCE CONVERSATION

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:16.924
THAT MESSAGE WILL RESONATE

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:18.259
ACROSS THIS STATE.

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:19.660
AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IN A

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:20.961
POSITIVE WAY.

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:22.997
THAT WILL ENABLE THE NEXT SETS

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.765
OF CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN TO

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:26.967
TRULY CHANGE WHAT NEEDS TO

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:28.602
CHANGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES HOW

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:31.238
ARE POLICE FORCES LOOK AT ACT

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.374
AND BE SENSITIVE.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.108
TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:35.442
INTERACTING WITH THAT'S HOW WE

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:36.777
REDUCE THE FEARS.

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:38.712
THAT'S HOW WE DO.

01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:40.648
CHANGE THE BIAS CALCULATION THAT

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:41.849
HAS BEEN MADE IN THEIR NUMBER

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.550
BILLS MOVING THROUGH RIGHT NOW I

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:44.551
THINK THEY'RE ALL OFF ON THE

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:46.654
SENATE TO ADDRESS THAT THAT BIAS

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.222
TRAINEE THAT INHERENT BIAS.

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:50.257
THAT WE ALL CARRY WHICH IS ONE

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:50.824
THING.

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.826
THE OTHER IS HOW WE ACT ON IT

01:38:52.893 --> 01:38:54.295
AND THIS BILL SETS A BETTER

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:57.197
STAGE FOR ENSURING THAT HOW

01:38:57.264 --> 01:39:00.501
POLICE FORCES ACT ON THAT BY IS.

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:02.236
IS DIFFERENT MAKE NO MISTAKE

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:04.004
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:06.040
WILL SEE A LOT OF CONTROVERSY

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:07.107
WHETHER IT'S GONE FAR ENOUGH

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:08.742
WHETHER IT'S GONE TOO FAR BUT IS

01:39:08.809 --> 01:39:11.078
UP TO US TO EMBRACE.

01:39:11.145 --> 01:39:12.813
WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US? TO BE

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.415
GRATEFUL TO AN AUTHOR WHO HAS

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.516
HAD THE PERSISTENCE AND THE

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.885
PATIENCE TO STAY WITH US AND

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:19.386
GUIDE US THROUGH A SET OF

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.721
CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:22.856
VERY VERY NECESSARY.

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:23.957
AND I WANT TO THANK OUR

01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:25.592
COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH LOS ANGELES

01:39:25.659 --> 01:39:27.795
FOR SPEAKING HONESTLY ABOUT FEAR

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:29.663
AND THAT INTERACTION THAT IS

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:31.899
SOMETHING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:33.600
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.235
PART OF MY EXPERIENCE.

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:37.705
SO WITH OUT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:39.039
SOUTHWEST SANDERS WITHOUT OUR

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:40.774
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:42.476
MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS

01:39:42.543 --> 01:39:44.445
LATINO CLOCK IS BEING A PART OF

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:45.746
THIS IN THE WOMEN WE HAVE THE

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:46.714
LEGISLATURE.

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.349
WITHOUT THEIR GUIDANCE AND THEIR

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:51.085
PERSPECTIVE WE WOULD STILL HAVE

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:52.453
A GOOD OLE BOY LEGISLATOR

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:54.154
LEGISLATURE THAT IS PASSING LAWS

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:56.123
THAT DO NOT REPRESENT THE CHANGE

AND THE IMPACT THAT IT CAN HAVE

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:11.632
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:14.835
THE FEARS THE CRIES.

01:41:28.615 --> 01:41:30.284
THAT IT IS A GAME CHANGER IN THE

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.453
SENSE THAT IT IS ASKING US AS

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:35.355
THE STATE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

01:41:35.422 --> 01:41:37.925
FOR THE FACT THAT SO MANY BLACK

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:53.173
BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT THAT

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.843
MUCH OF A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE

01:41:55.909 --> 01:41:58.445
THE AUTONOMY IT IS STILL LINKED

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:01.248
TO THE ECONOMY THAT IS HELD BY

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.883
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.418
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:06.386
AND THEY STILL HOLD THE

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:09.356
SAFEGUARDS AS IT RELATES TO LAW

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:11.525

ON THURSDAY. TO A WHOLE NEW

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:18.499
WORLD.

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:21.134
BUT HOPEFULLY WE WILL WAKE UP.

01:42:21.201 --> 01:42:23.570
AND SAY THAT WE HAVE OPEN THE

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:25.973
DOOR FOR REAL CONVERSATIONS TO

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:27.140
HAPPEN ABOUT HOW OUR LAW

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:28.809

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:29.977
WORKED.

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:32.346
AND NOT PROPERLY TRAINED AND

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:34.414

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:35.949
HOW ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT NO

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:41.822
PROTECT?

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:43.790
AND PROBABLY HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:42:43.857 --> 01:42:45.893
FEARS FOR THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:48.295
GO INTO THOSE VERY SAME

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:49.630
COMMUNITIES.

01:42:49.696 --> 01:42:54.167
THAT FORMULA IS COMBUSTIBLE.

01:42:54.234 --> 01:42:55.869
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

01:42:55.936 --> 01:42:58.105
SO MANY BLACK AND BROWN AND POOR

01:42:58.171 --> 01:42:59.873
COMMUNITIES WANT TO CALL THE

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:03.143
POLICE WHEN SOMETHING'S GOING ON

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:04.945
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HELP.

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:06.713
BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO BECAUSE

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.715
THEY DON'T WANT THAT CALL TO

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:10.050
TURN INTO SOME OTHER

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:12.352
CONVERSATION THAT ENDS UP IN

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:16.156

I WANT MY FAMILY TO BE PROTECTED

I WANT TO MAKE SURE BAD PEOPLE

LIVING IN THAT WE ALL LOVE.

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:50.490
ARE SAFE.

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:53.727
THIS BILL IS ABOUT VAX.

01:43:53.794 --> 01:43:56.430

OURSELVES.

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:13.113
AND INSTEAD OF TALKING.

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.682
WE ARE RUNNING FROM [inaudible]

WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR DECISION?

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:05.058
TO BE A POLICE OFFICER.

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:07.894
THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST HUMAN

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.663
BEINGS YOU CAN POSSIBLY FIND.

01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:11.864

AND ALL OF THAT.

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:25.311
AND WE ENDED UP [inaudible]

01:56:25.378 --> 01:56:28.815
HIRING AND CRIME WENT DOWN.

01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:31.651

BECAME.

01:56:33.953 --> 01:56:36.055
ALLIES.

IT WASN'T EASY.

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:39.325
BUT IT WAS BECAUSE WE DID HAVE

01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:41.094
THE RESPECT.

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.395
OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE HAD A

01:56:42.462 --> 01:56:44.063
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:45.565
THAT WAS LED BY A SUCCESSION OF

01:56:45.631 --> 01:56:46.766
CHIEFS THAT INSTILLED

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:47.066

01:56:47.133 --> 01:56:48.568
IN THEM.

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:50.336
THE NECESSITY TO USE THAT FORCE

01:56:50.403 --> 01:56:52.839
WITH WISDOM.

01:56:52.905 --> 01:56:54.240
AND SO I RISE WITH.

01:56:54.307 --> 01:56:56.309
A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE

01:56:56.376 --> 01:56:56.609
[inaudible]

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:58.444
OF EXPERIENCE [inaudible]

01:56:58.511 --> 01:57:00.246
WHEN IT?

01:57:00.313 --> 01:57:03.983
COMES TO THE ONE OR TWO TIMES.

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:07.053
WHEN A POLICE OFFICER?

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:09.722
HAD TO USE DEADLY FORCE.

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:11.157
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.191

THE STANDARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:41.721
THE PRACTICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN.

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.122
THAT WE THAT THERE WOULD BE A A

REASONABLENESS.

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.062
THAT THERE THAT THERE WOULD BE A

01:57:50.129 --> 01:57:52.732
NECESSITY.

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:57.003
AND THAT WHEN IT WAS PUT TO THE

01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:59.439
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

OF THIS OF THIS MONTH ONLY.

02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:07.186

BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO LIVING IN A

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:18.064
HEIGHTENED AREA FEAR WHEN WE

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:19.231

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:21.634
OCCURRING AROUND US.

AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS IN OUR

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:23.669

COUNTRY ON THOSE ISSUES.

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:44.643
AND I SAT IN THAT COMMITTEE

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.912
HEARING -- AS MUCH AS MIGHT

02:04:46.979 --> 02:04:48.681
NEIGHBORING COLLEAGUE HAD

02:04:48.747 --> 02:04:48.948
MENTIONED.

02:04:49.014 --> 02:04:52.084
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SPOKE IN

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:54.453
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.589
AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE

02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:57.890
MOTHERS WHO HAD LOST

02:04:57.957 --> 02:04:58.190

02:04:58.257 --> 02:05:00.426
THEIR CHILDREN.

02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:02.027
AT THE HANDS OF GUN VIOLENCE

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:04.163
FROM POLICE.

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:07.600
AND THEY HELP THOSE PHOTOS UP.

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:08.901
AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY MOVING TO

02:05:08.968 --> 02:05:10.703
SEE.

02:05:10.769 --> 02:05:13.072
AND VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE.

02:05:13.138 --> 02:05:14.707
AND I THINK WHAT THIS BILL DOES

02:05:14.773 --> 02:05:16.842
IS IT STRIKES AT THE HEART.

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:18.077
AND TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:05:18.143 --> 02:05:19.945
THESE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS.

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.247
THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:22.781
THE TRUTH THAT.

02:05:22.848 --> 02:05:24.683
BROWN AND BLACK MEN PRIMARILY

02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:26.051
ARE THE ONES WHO WERE KILLED AT

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:28.487
THE HANDS THE HANDS OF POLICE.

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:29.555
PEOPLE WITH MY SKIN COLOR.

02:05:29.622 --> 02:05:31.790
OR NOT.

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:33.993
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.494
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:39.498
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:40.132
SEVENTY TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED

02:05:40.199 --> 02:05:40.666
AT THE HANDS OF POLICE.

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:41.233
LESS THAN HALF OF THEM WERE

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:43.235
ARMED.

02:05:43.302 --> 02:05:44.303
AND OF THOSE THAT WERE KILLED

02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:46.705
WHO WERE UNARMED. 75% WERE

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:50.075
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

02:05:50.142 --> 02:05:50.843
AND I THINK WITH THIS BILL TRIES

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:52.544
TO DO IS TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:53.545
THESE CONCERNS.

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:54.747
AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BOTH

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:56.448
BELIEVE.

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.050
WE CAN HOLD IN IN OUR HEARTS THE

02:05:58.117 --> 02:05:59.685
IDEA THAT.

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.787
THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE ARE

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:04.023
TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB.

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:05.157
AND THEY ARE BROTHERS AND OUR

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:06.392
SISTERS AND OUR MOTHERS AND OUR

02:06:06.458 --> 02:06:07.626
FATHERS.

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.528
AND OUR CHILDREN.

02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:11.797
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB.

02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:13.132
THEY'RE ALSO.

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:15.734
EXPERIENCING TRAUMA AND STRESS.

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:17.636
AND DON'T ALL OF THEM HAVE THE

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:19.438
TOOLS TO DO THE GOOD JOB THAT WE

02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:21.774
KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO.

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:22.408
AND WE DO KNOW THAT MISTAKES ARE

02:06:22.474 --> 02:06:24.176
MADE.

02:06:24.243 --> 02:06:25.311
AND ALSO THE UNCOMFORTABLE

02:06:25.377 --> 02:06:26.512
TRUTHS THAT I THINK THIS BILL IS

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:28.447
TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:06:28.514 --> 02:06:29.915
AND I THINK THE WAY THAT WE

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:31.250
REBUILD TRUST IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:32.251
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT GOOD

02:06:32.318 --> 02:06:33.519
POLICING IS BASED ON THE WAY WE

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:34.987
DO THAT IS WE HAVE MORE

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:36.622

AND WE HAVE THE LEGAL TOOLS IN

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:43.429
OUR TOOLBOX. TO HOLD FOLKS

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:44.863
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THESE TRAGIC

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:48.267
MISTAKES HAPPEN.

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:50.302
I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS WORK

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:06.791
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT SOBERLY

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:07.092
[inaudible]

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:09.761
I THOUGHT [inaudible]

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:12.197
IN MINE.

02:16:12.264 --> 02:16:12.964
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:15.400
CHANGING SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:20.605
BEEN TOUCHED SINCE.

02:16:20.672 --> 02:16:22.240
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SO I WANT.

02:16:22.307 --> 02:16:23.375
TO SIMPLY SAY THAT THE AUTHOR

02:16:23.441 --> 02:16:26.711
HAS DONE HER DUE DILIGENCE.

02:16:26.778 --> 02:16:29.347
SHE PUT THE TIME IN.

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:31.950
SHE HAS STILL OF THE COURSE.

02:16:32.017 --> 02:16:33.184
THE WHITE OUR STATE ON HER

02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:33.785
SHOULDERS.

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:35.487
BUT SHE HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:37.355
TOGETHER WHO WOULD NOT TALK

02:16:37.422 --> 02:16:39.858
BEFORE.

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:42.227
BROKERED A COMPROMISE.

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:42.827
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SOME

02:16:42.894 --> 02:16:44.563
PEOPLE MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:45.864
WITH THAT.

02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:46.998
BUT I BELIEVE THAT OUR WORK IS

02:16:47.065 --> 02:16:48.900
NOT FINISHED YET.

02:16:48.967 --> 02:16:50.135
AND I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN

02:16:50.201 --> 02:16:53.338
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:16:53.405 --> 02:16:54.439
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LAWN

02:16:54.506 --> 02:16:55.740
FORCED WAS PROTECTED.

02:16:55.807 --> 02:16:57.242
BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:58.877
THAT OUR YOUNG MEN.

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:01.446
IN MY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA

02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:03.949
ARE PROTECTED AS WELL.

02:17:04.015 --> 02:17:04.916
THAT'S ALL I WANNA THANK THIS

02:17:04.983 --> 02:17:06.818
AUTHOR FOR STANDING UP DOING

02:17:06.885 --> 02:17:09.120

IMPORTANT IT TALKS ABOUT THE

02:17:23.868 --> 02:17:25.170
TRAINING THAT'S NECESSARY FOR

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:26.671
THIS NEXT GENERATION OF POLICE

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:28.740
OFFICERS YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:31.176

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:48.026
AND TAKE THIS AUTHOR FOR

02:17:48.093 --> 02:17:49.394
BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE US

02:17:49.461 --> 02:17:50.795
TODAY.

02:17:50.862 --> 02:17:54.833
THANK YOU MS GIBSON [inaudible]

02:17:54.899 --> 02:17:56.268
MR LACKEY.

02:17:56.334 --> 02:18:05.110
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:18:05.176 --> 02:18:06.611
I WAS GOING TO SPEAK.

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:09.047
BUT I FELT LIKE.

02:18:09.114 --> 02:18:09.648
THEY'LL BE A BETRAYAL TO THIS

02:18:09.714 --> 02:18:21.993
ISSUE.

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.863
IN MY ENTIRE ELECTED EXPERIENCE.

02:18:24.929 --> 02:18:27.465
NEVER HAS A BILL.

02:18:27.532 --> 02:18:28.867
CONSUMED MY THINKING AS THIS

02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:33.271
HOUSE.

02:18:33.338 --> 02:18:36.241
AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.

02:18:36.307 --> 02:18:37.375
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF MY LIFE

02:18:37.442 --> 02:18:39.077
EXPERIENCE.

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:40.478
BEING DIFFERENT THAN MOST IN

02:18:40.545 --> 02:18:41.546
THIS BODY AS IT COMES TO THIS

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:45.784
ISSUE.

02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:48.219
WE TALK ABOUT.

02:18:48.286 --> 02:18:51.056
CHANGES THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:53.224
IN ORDER TO BRING.

02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:55.427
RESOLUTION TO A VERY

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:55.727
[inaudible]

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:58.096
DIFFICULT MATTER.

02:18:58.163 --> 02:19:00.965
AND WE TALK ABOUT.

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:02.067
THE KINDS OF CHANGES NEED TO

02:19:02.133 --> 02:19:05.136
TAKE PLACE.

02:19:05.203 --> 02:19:07.272
WITHOUT HAVING A BALANCED VIEW

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:08.606
OF OF THE CHANGE NEEDS TO TAKE

02:19:08.673 --> 02:19:10.175
PLACE.

02:19:10.241 --> 02:19:12.077
COLLEAGUES I WOULD TELL YOU THAT

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:14.879
WE NEED A CULTURE CHANGE.

02:19:14.946 --> 02:19:15.480
AND PART OF THAT CHANGE THAT

02:19:15.547 --> 02:19:16.381
NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE IS THE

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:18.116
COMMUNICATION.

02:19:18.183 --> 02:19:21.052
BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME SO

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:22.020
POLARIZED IN OUR THINKING AND

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:23.588
THERE'S SO MUCH ANGER AND SO

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:25.356
MUCH EMOTION.

02:19:25.423 --> 02:19:27.759
THAT HAS FILLED OUR HEARTS.

02:19:27.826 --> 02:19:28.593
AND A LOT BECAUSE OF

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:32.130
MISUNDERSTANDING A LOT BECAUSE

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:35.233
OUR CULTURE HAS.

02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:37.168
CHOSEN A PATHWAY THAT IDENTIFIES

02:19:37.235 --> 02:19:38.336
AND DIFFERENCES INSTEAD OF

02:19:38.403 --> 02:19:40.004
COMMONALITIES WE ARE THE UNITED

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:42.707
STATES.

02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:44.075
AND WE NEED TO BECOME UNITED

02:19:44.142 --> 02:19:47.512
CULTURE WE NEED TO BECOME UNITED

02:19:47.579 --> 02:19:47.812
[inaudible]

02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:50.648
STATE.

02:19:50.715 --> 02:19:53.718
AND MORE TO THIS ISSUE.

02:19:53.785 --> 02:19:55.053
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT MY

02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:57.489
BIGGEST CONCERN.

02:19:57.555 --> 02:20:00.191
IS NOT THAT WE HAVE NOT.

02:20:00.258 --> 02:20:02.026
HAD UNNECESSARY VICTIMS BUT THE

02:20:02.093 --> 02:20:04.929
WE DIDN'T TURN THE TABLE.

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:06.498
AND MAKE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:20:06.564 --> 02:20:08.700
UNNECESSARY VICTIMS.

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:10.702
BECAUSE IT'S MY OPINION THAT AT

02:20:10.769 --> 02:20:11.703
ONE STAGE OF THIS BILL WE WOULD

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:14.806
HAVE DONE THAT.

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:17.642
BUT I WON ALSO THANK SOMEBODY.

02:20:17.709 --> 02:20:18.877
THAT I DON'T OFTEN THANK AND

02:20:18.943 --> 02:20:21.312
THAT IS OUR GOVERNOR. FOR TO

02:20:21.379 --> 02:20:22.480
TAKING A PERSONAL INTEREST IN

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:24.749
THIS MATTER.

02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:26.384
AND FOR HAVING A VERY POWERFUL

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:28.019
INFLUENCE ON REACHING WHAT WE'RE

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:32.390
LOOKING AT TODAY.

02:20:32.457 --> 02:20:33.792
I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU

02:20:33.858 --> 02:20:36.494
ONE DESERVED STORY.

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:39.764
AND ONE REASON WHY I AM SO

02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:40.064
[inaudible]

02:20:40.131 --> 02:20:42.534
EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED. TO THIS

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:45.336
ISSUE.

02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:46.538
YOU SEE.

02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:48.006
DEADLY FORCE IS SOMETHING THAT

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:50.175
VERY FEW.

02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:51.976
PEOPLE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND.

02:20:52.043 --> 02:20:53.344
AND I HOPE THAT YOU NEVER HAVE

02:20:53.411 --> 02:20:54.813
TO UNDERSTAND [inaudible]

02:20:54.879 --> 02:20:59.050
BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREES

02:20:59.117 --> 02:21:00.819
TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THESE

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:03.054
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:04.322
AND WHEN THEY HAPPENED THEY

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:06.357
HAPPENED SO FAST.

02:21:06.424 --> 02:21:07.859
AND THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE

02:21:07.926 --> 02:21:09.360
ARE SO QUICK.

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:11.296
THE VERY FEW CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:21:11.362 --> 02:21:13.198
THAT MEANS.

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:14.799
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED SO FAST THAT

02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:16.501
YOU DON'T THINK.

02:21:16.568 --> 02:21:18.469
YOU REACT.

02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:20.205
AND YOU RELY UPON.

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:22.407
THE PIVOTAL PIECE OF WHAT WE

02:21:22.473 --> 02:21:24.209
NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON AND THAT

02:21:24.275 --> 02:21:26.511
IS TRAINING.

02:21:26.578 --> 02:21:28.580
BECAUSE MOST OFFICERS A VERY

02:21:28.646 --> 02:21:30.114
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OFFICERS

02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:33.117
EVER FACED THIS.

02:21:33.184 --> 02:21:34.686
AND THAT'S SOMETHING MAYBE.

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:37.322
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:38.456
AS DEADLY FORCE IS RARELY

02:21:38.523 --> 02:21:38.756
[inaudible]

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:41.292
CALL UPON.

02:21:41.359 --> 02:21:42.760
BUT WHEN IT IS IT IS THE MOST

02:21:42.827 --> 02:21:44.362
CRITICAL THING THAT CAN HAPPEN

02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:45.296
IN ONE'S LIFE.

02:21:45.363 --> 02:21:47.699
BOTH FOR THE OFFICER.

02:21:47.765 --> 02:21:50.134
AS WELL AS THE PERPETRATOR THE

02:21:50.201 --> 02:21:52.337
PERSON THAT'S THE OTHER HALF OF

02:21:52.403 --> 02:21:55.640
THE EQUATION.

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:59.510
AND I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU.

02:21:59.577 --> 02:22:01.246
THE OFFICERS DON'T GO OUT WITH.

02:22:01.312 --> 02:22:02.647
WITH.

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:04.515
A PERSPECTIVE A PREDATION WE'RE

02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:06.718
NOT PREDATORS SPOKES AND WHEN I

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:07.719
SAY WE HAVE NO LONGER AN OFFICER

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:10.321
BUT WHEN I WAS AN OFFICER THAT

02:22:10.388 --> 02:22:11.656
WAS FURTHER STATE FOR OUR MIND.

02:22:11.723 --> 02:22:14.092
WE ARE WILLING TO DIE FOR PEOPLE

02:22:14.158 --> 02:22:15.660
WE'VE NEVER MET.

02:22:15.727 --> 02:22:16.861
AND THAT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:18.396
NEEDS TO BE VALIDATED AND NEEDS

02:22:18.463 --> 02:22:19.497
TO BE COMMUNICATED AND NEEDS TO

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:21.299
BE [inaudible]

02:22:21.366 --> 02:22:24.035
DISCUSSED.

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:25.270
BECAUSE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN

02:22:25.336 --> 02:22:26.471
SOMEONE WHO IS A VERY BIG PART

02:22:26.537 --> 02:22:29.307
OF MY LIFE.

02:22:29.374 --> 02:22:34.112
HAD TO USE DEADLY FORCE.

02:22:34.178 --> 02:22:37.215
HE WAS SHOT DURING THE ENCOUNTER.

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:39.384
BUT FROM THAT DAY HE WAS NEVER

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:42.053
THE SAME INDIVIDUAL.

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.656
BECAUSE HE HAD TO USE.

02:22:44.722 --> 02:22:45.790
THE FORCE HE WAS TRAINED TO USE

02:22:45.857 --> 02:22:48.059
AND THAT THAT DECISION AND THAT

02:22:48.126 --> 02:22:50.161
THAT CIRCUMSTANCE CALLED UPON.

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:52.130
BUT HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO ADAPT.

02:22:52.196 --> 02:22:53.164
TO THAT.

02:22:53.231 --> 02:22:55.199
CHALLENGE AND HE ENGAGED IN SOME

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:57.001
DESTRUCTIVE.

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:59.037
COPING MECHANISMS TO THE POINT

02:22:59.103 --> 02:22:59.971
TO WHERE HE ENDED UP TAKING HIS

02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:02.307
OWN LIFE.

02:23:02.373 --> 02:23:03.541
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER

02:23:03.608 --> 02:23:05.910
EVERYONE.

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:07.612
I'M THANKFUL THERE I THINK WE'VE

02:23:07.679 --> 02:23:10.214
COME AT AND THIS BILL STILL HAS

02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:12.717
SOME THINGS TO TROUBLE ME.

02:23:12.784 --> 02:23:15.320
BUT IT'S WHAT HAS BROUGHT US

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:16.988
TOGETHER WE NEED TO BE. TO HAVE

02:23:17.055 --> 02:23:19.290
BALANCE AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

02:23:19.357 --> 02:23:20.525
WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:21.960
BRINGING US TOGETHER AND I

02:23:22.026 --> 02:23:23.361
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES THAT

02:23:23.428 --> 02:23:24.829
AND SO WILL OR MY SUPPORT THANK

02:23:24.896 --> 02:23:27.165
YOU.

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:28.633
THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY MISTER

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:31.436

IT IS OBVIOUS TO SO MANY PEOPLE

FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS.

THAT IS WHY COMMUNITIES AND LAW

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:57.501
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE

02:27:57.568 --> 02:27:59.136
RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NEED TO HOLD

THE AUTHORIZING PEACE OFFICERS

NECESSARY TO DEFEND AGAINST AN

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:19.590
IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OF

02:28:19.657 --> 02:28:20.791
SERIOUS BODILY INJURY.

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:21.959
AND CONSIDERING THE ACTIONS OF

02:28:22.026 --> 02:28:24.195

02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:26.998
THREE NINE TO BRING CALIFORNIA

UP TO THAT HIGHER STANDARD.

02:28:29.133 --> 02:28:29.934
LAW ENFORCEMENT AS SOMEONE

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:31.402
MENTIONED EXPRESSED EARLIER THAT

02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:34.038
WE BE FOCUSING ON AYE HINDSIGHT

02:28:34.105 --> 02:28:36.641
TWENTY TWENTY VISION IN TERMS OF

02:28:36.707 --> 02:28:37.074
WE DID THAT COULD.

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:38.175
MAKING THEM.

02:28:38.242 --> 02:28:38.643
BASICALLY SECOND GUESS

02:28:38.709 --> 02:28:39.543
THEMSELVES.

02:28:39.610 --> 02:28:40.811
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE

02:28:40.878 --> 02:28:42.146
LANGUAGE THAT WAS CHANGED

02:28:42.213 --> 02:28:44.582
ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BECAUSE

02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:46.017
THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENT.

02:28:46.083 --> 02:28:47.251
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS ASKED TO

02:28:47.318 --> 02:28:49.420
TAKE THIS BILL -- WITH ALL OF

02:28:49.487 --> 02:28:50.488
THE SPONSORS AND THE PEOPLE

02:28:50.554 --> 02:28:52.156
BEHIND IT.

02:28:52.223 --> 02:28:53.824
I TOOK IT WOULD GREAT

02:28:53.891 --> 02:28:54.125
[inaudible]

02:28:54.191 --> 02:28:56.294
GREAT CONCERN.

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.029
BECAUSE MOST OF YOU KNOW I'M AN

02:28:58.095 --> 02:28:58.929
EDUCATOR AND I CAME OVER TO DO

02:28:58.996 --> 02:29:00.498
EDUCATION STUFF.

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:01.532
AND YET I'VE DONE A LOT OF

02:29:01.599 --> 02:29:03.000
SOCIAL JUSTICE WORK AND I GUESS

02:29:03.067 --> 02:29:04.402
THAT'S A PART OF IT AS WELL.

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:05.970
BECAUSE OF OF MY OWN PERSONAL

02:29:06.037 --> 02:29:08.372
EXPERIENCE OF OF ALWAYS FIGHTING

02:29:08.439 --> 02:29:10.341
FOR THOSE WHO ARE BEING LEFT OUT

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:13.077
AND BEEN IGNORED IN THE SYSTEM.

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:13.711
AND SO WHEN I WAS ASKED TO TAKE

02:29:13.778 --> 02:29:15.179
THIS BILL.

02:29:15.246 --> 02:29:15.780
I LOOKED AT IT AND I THOUGHT

02:29:15.846 --> 02:29:17.048
ABOUT IT.

02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:17.682
DIDN'T SEEM VERY COMPLICATED TO

02:29:17.748 --> 02:29:18.949
ME.

02:29:19.016 --> 02:29:20.184
SIMPLE SAYING YOU DON'T TAKE

02:29:20.251 --> 02:29:21.619
LIFE UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY WHICH

02:29:21.686 --> 02:29:23.587
SOUNDS TO BE WHAT MOST OF US

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:25.056
THINK IS THE NORMAL PRACTICE.

02:29:25.122 --> 02:29:26.190
BUT AS MANY THINGS THAT I

02:29:26.257 --> 02:29:27.558
REALIZE ABOUT TO BE DEFERRED

02:29:27.625 --> 02:29:28.859
DIFFICULT.

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:30.494
I REALIZE IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:29:30.561 --> 02:29:31.996
THAT WE HAVE MADE CHANGE IN THIS

02:29:32.063 --> 02:29:33.831
COUNTRY NOT JUST BECAUSE OF OUR

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:35.166
WORDS AND OUR ACTIONS.

02:29:35.232 --> 02:29:37.668
BUT BECAUSE OF OUR SPIRIT.

02:29:37.735 --> 02:29:38.302
AND SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MY

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:39.904
CHURCH.

02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:41.339
AND I ASKED THEM AND TOLD THEM

02:29:41.405 --> 02:29:42.840
WHAT THAT I WAS BEING ASKED TO

02:29:42.907 --> 02:29:45.042
DO SOMETHING REALLY DIFFICULT.

02:29:45.109 --> 02:29:45.676
THE KIND OF EXPLAINED IT TO ME A

02:29:45.743 --> 02:29:46.644
LITTLE BIT.

02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:47.578
AND I SAID I WANT YOU TO PRAY

02:29:47.645 --> 02:29:48.913
FOR ME.

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:50.147
SO THAT I CAN MAKE A GOOD

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:52.149
DECISION AS TO WHETHER NOT THIS

02:29:52.216 --> 02:29:54.618
IS SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD DO.

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:56.120
IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE

02:29:56.187 --> 02:29:56.721
NEXT WEEK MANY OF THEM CAME TO

02:29:56.787 --> 02:29:58.356
ME AND SAY THAT.

02:29:58.422 --> 02:29:59.423
WE'RE PRAYING.

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:02.293
THAT YOU WILL DO IT.

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:03.194
WE ARE PRAYING THAT YOU WILL DO

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:05.129
THIS.

02:30:05.196 --> 02:30:06.130
THEY SAID BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK

02:30:06.197 --> 02:30:07.698
AROUND WHAT IS AVAILABLE YOU

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:09.133
PROBABLY HAVE THE GREATEST

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:09.867
AMOUNT OF STRENGTH AND

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:12.036
PERSEVERANCE.

02:30:12.103 --> 02:30:13.938
THEN ANYBODY ELSE THAT WE KNOW.

02:30:14.004 --> 02:30:15.339
THAT YOU ALWAYS FIGHT THESE

02:30:15.406 --> 02:30:16.507
BATTLES AND YOU HANG IN THERE

02:30:16.574 --> 02:30:18.109
AND YOU DON'T GET WORRIED.

02:30:18.175 --> 02:30:19.276
AND SO I'VE HAD TO GO TO THE

02:30:19.343 --> 02:30:22.480
MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST YEAR.

02:30:22.546 --> 02:30:23.881
TO SAY PRAY FOR ME.

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:25.549
HOLD ME UP BECAUSE THIS IS

02:30:25.616 --> 02:30:27.585
DIFFICULT.

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:29.086
AND IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:30.621
EXPERIENCE IS THE HARDEST THING

02:30:30.688 --> 02:30:32.990
THAT I HAVE DONE ON THIS FLOOR

02:30:33.057 --> 02:30:34.825
IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:36.327
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:37.194
ABOUT THAT IS SO VERY VERY

02:30:37.261 --> 02:30:39.029
IMPORTANT.

02:30:39.096 --> 02:30:40.398
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO PERSONALIZE

02:30:40.464 --> 02:30:41.999
I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT ABOUT

02:30:42.066 --> 02:30:42.600
ME I WANT TO MAKE IT ABOUT THE

02:30:42.666 --> 02:30:43.834
ISSUES.

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:45.369
AND I WANTED TO BE AWARE OF ALL

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:46.604
THE PIECES THAT WERE PART OF IT

02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:48.239
AND SO I THINK THOSE WHO HELPED

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:49.840
WRITE THIS BILL.

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:51.542
I THANK THOSE FAMILIES WHO WHO

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:53.010
BELIEVED IN ME ENOUGH TO IN

02:30:53.077 --> 02:30:56.147
TRUST ME. TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR

02:30:56.213 --> 02:30:56.714
THEM IN THERE AND THAT THEIR

02:30:56.781 --> 02:30:57.681
CHILDREN.

02:30:57.748 --> 02:30:59.049
AND I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:00.985
THE DEEP AND PROFOUND HER THAT

02:31:01.051 --> 02:31:03.120
SO MANY OF THEM FEEL.

02:31:03.187 --> 02:31:04.889
THAT IS YEARS AND YEARS OLD THE

02:31:04.955 --> 02:31:06.290
FEELING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET.

02:31:06.357 --> 02:31:07.725
THEY WERE AT HER THEY DIDN'T

02:31:07.792 --> 02:31:09.393
HAVE JUSTICE AND THOSE KINDS OF

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:10.728
THINGS AND THAT WAS EXTREMELY

02:31:10.795 --> 02:31:12.163
IMPORTANT TO ME.

02:31:12.229 --> 02:31:14.031
SO I THANK HIM FOR IN TRUSTING

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:16.801
ME TO CARRY THIS FOR THEM.

02:31:16.867 --> 02:31:18.869
I ALSO THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR

02:31:18.936 --> 02:31:21.071
THEIR OPPOSITION.

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:22.473
BECAUSE THEIR OPPOSITION HELPED

02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:24.208
ME TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF

02:31:24.275 --> 02:31:26.177
THEIR CONCERN.

02:31:26.243 --> 02:31:28.479
AND HELP ME ALSO TO APPRECIATE

02:31:28.546 --> 02:31:29.947
THE FACT THAT THIS HAD TO BE A

02:31:30.014 --> 02:31:31.549
BILL THAT HAD SOME BALANCE.

02:31:31.615 --> 02:31:33.050
AND I KEPT SAYING THAT THIS BILL

02:31:33.117 --> 02:31:36.020
WILL MAKE IT SAFE BEHIND AND IN

02:31:36.086 --> 02:31:36.687
FRONT OF THE BAD.

02:31:36.754 --> 02:31:38.122
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT THIS

02:31:38.189 --> 02:31:39.657
IS NOT A AS SOME OF THE EARLIEST

02:31:39.723 --> 02:31:40.925
I SAID THIS WAS NOT ABOUT TO GET

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:41.859
TO BE ILL.

02:31:41.926 --> 02:31:43.561
I DON'T WANT TO CATCH FOLKS I

02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:45.429
WANT TO PREVENT THE ACTIONS AND

02:31:45.496 --> 02:31:46.664
ONE IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP

02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:48.466
THAT EXISTS IN COMMUNITIES WITH

02:31:48.532 --> 02:31:49.366
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:31:49.433 --> 02:31:51.168
THAT MY COMMUNITY DESERVES TO

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:53.938
HAVE THE LUXURY.

02:31:54.004 --> 02:31:55.473
OF CALLING THE POLICE AND

02:31:55.539 --> 02:31:57.908
KNOWING THAT LIFE GETS BETTER AS

02:31:57.975 --> 02:31:59.143
A RESULT OF THEM COMING.

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:00.811
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T FEEL THAT

02:32:00.878 --> 02:32:01.312
THEN THEY WILL NOT TAKE

02:32:01.378 --> 02:32:03.080
ADVANTAGE OF IT.

02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:04.515
AS I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO

02:32:04.582 --> 02:32:05.816
STOOD WITH ME EARLY IN THE GAME

02:32:05.883 --> 02:32:08.886
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WITH.

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:09.453
NINE THREE ONE AND THOSE WHO

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:10.521
HUNG IN HERE THIS TIME.

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:12.490
THE HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:14.725
THE FAMILIES WHO SHARED AND CARE

02:32:14.792 --> 02:32:16.527
AND WILL WILLING ALSO TO

02:32:16.594 --> 02:32:18.662
SOMETIMES SUSPEND THEIR PERSONAL

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.231
DESIRES FOR US TO REACH A

02:32:20.297 --> 02:32:21.465
CONCLUSION.

02:32:21.532 --> 02:32:23.200
THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE

02:32:23.267 --> 02:32:24.535
VAST MAJORITY OF THEM.

02:32:24.602 --> 02:32:26.203
BECAUSE THEY WANT CHANGE.

02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:27.738
THEY WANT TO BE SAFE THEY WANT

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:29.106
TO KNOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:30.541
COME HOME IN THE EVENING.

02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:31.375
THEY WANT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:32.443
THAT HEALTH AND THEY DON'T WANT

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:33.777
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO LEAVE THEIR

02:32:33.844 --> 02:32:34.512
COMMUNITIES.

02:32:34.578 --> 02:32:36.180
THEY WANT GOODS POLICE OFFICERS

02:32:36.247 --> 02:32:37.281
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:38.415
THEM SAFE.

02:32:38.482 --> 02:32:40.017
AND SO THIS IS A THIS IS BEEN A

02:32:40.084 --> 02:32:41.452
CHALLENGE FOR ME.

02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:42.887
MUCH OLDER THAN A HUNDRED AND

02:32:42.953 --> 02:32:48.526
THEN EIGHTEEN OF FIFTY I THINK.

02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:49.126
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE OH SEVEN

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:49.760
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THIS IS A

02:32:49.827 --> 02:32:51.095
FOUR HUNDRED YEAR CHALLENGE TO

02:32:51.161 --> 02:32:51.662
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THIS

02:32:51.729 --> 02:32:52.296
COUNTRY.

02:32:52.363 --> 02:32:54.365
BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITION OF OUR

02:32:54.431 --> 02:32:56.767
LIVES AND THE BONE ABILITY OF

02:32:56.834 --> 02:32:58.068
AFRICAN AMERICANS WHETHER WAS

02:32:58.135 --> 02:32:59.537
DEALING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:32:59.603 --> 02:33:00.471
WEATHER WAS DEALING WITH LYNCH

02:33:00.538 --> 02:33:02.039
MOB TO WHAT IT WAS.

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:04.341
IT WAS THAT WHOLE ISSUE THAT WE

02:33:04.408 --> 02:33:05.643
HAD ALL OUR LIVES TO ALWAYS BE

02:33:05.709 --> 02:33:06.610
CURIOUS.

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:07.745
AND COULD EASILY BE TAKEN

02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:09.613
WITHOUT ANY JUSTICE OR ANYONE

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:11.015
FIGHTING BACK.

02:33:11.081 --> 02:33:11.448
AND SO I TOOK THIS

02:33:11.515 --> 02:33:14.084
RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY

02:33:14.151 --> 02:33:15.386
BECAUSE I RESPECT YOU.

02:33:15.452 --> 02:33:17.121
AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

02:33:17.187 --> 02:33:18.222
WHAT WE WERE DOING.

02:33:18.289 --> 02:33:19.590
THAT THIS IS GOING TO MAKE A

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:20.658
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:22.092
CALIFORNIA.

02:33:22.159 --> 02:33:24.161
AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT IS ALL THE

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:25.963
AND AND AND ALL OF THE ANALYSIS

02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:27.798

02:33:27.865 --> 02:33:29.066
POWERFUL FORCE OF THE STRONG

ABOUT WHEN YOU USE LETHAL FORCE

02:33:32.169 --> 02:33:33.737

THEY SAID LOOK AT GOD.

02:33:58.662 --> 02:33:59.964
AND THAT WAS PROFOUND FOR THEM

02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:01.665

04:12:33.505 --> 04:12:35.006
OF UNCERTAINTIES.

04:12:35.073 --> 04:12:36.641
AND SO WHAT AB FIVE DOES IS

04:12:36.708 --> 04:12:38.176
CODIFY THAT DECISION SO THAT

04:12:38.243 --> 04:12:39.744
WE'RE NOT STUCK IN COURT OVER

04:12:39.811 --> 04:12:41.246
THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS.

04:12:41.312 --> 04:12:42.914
DETERMINING EACH INDIVIDUAL

04:12:42.981 --> 04:12:44.482
SMALL INDUSTRY AND HOW IT

04:12:44.549 --> 04:12:46.184
APPLIES SINCE THE SUPREME COURT

04:12:46.251 --> 04:12:47.719
HAS BEEN CLEAR WE KNOW HOW TO

04:12:47.785 --> 04:12:49.120
APPLY.

04:12:49.187 --> 04:12:50.388
AND TO ADD CERTAINTY TO OUR

04:12:50.455 --> 04:12:52.056
BUSINESSES THAT HISTORICALLY

04:12:52.123 --> 04:12:54.025
HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE OF TRADITIONAL

04:12:54.092 --> 04:12:55.927
WAGE ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN

04:12:55.994 --> 04:12:58.162
OUTSIDE OF THIS IDEA OF NEEDING

04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:59.731
TO PROTECT WORKERS.

04:12:59.797 --> 04:13:01.766
THERE INDUSTRIES BY AND FAR

04:13:01.833 --> 04:13:04.402
WHERE WORKERS MAKE -- MORE THAN

04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:05.703
TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE ARE

04:13:05.770 --> 04:13:07.572
STANDARD FOR BEING ABLE TO BE

04:13:07.639 --> 04:13:09.340
EXEMPT FROM OVERTIME.

04:13:09.407 --> 04:13:13.745
AND WAIT CHEN MEAL BREAKS.

04:13:13.811 --> 04:13:14.479
THEIR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE.

04:13:14.546 --> 04:13:16.180
THAT CAN ACTUALLY SERVE AS

04:13:16.247 --> 04:13:18.016
INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES WHERE

04:13:18.082 --> 04:13:19.551
THEY'RE NEGOTIATING THEIR OWN

04:13:19.617 --> 04:13:20.718
SALARIES NOT JUST ABOUT

04:13:20.785 --> 04:13:22.887
FLEXIBILITY BUT ACTUALLY ABOUT

04:13:22.954 --> 04:13:24.389
THEIR SAID IN THEIR OWN RATES.

04:13:24.455 --> 04:13:24.956
IN ENSURING THAT THEY CAN

04:13:25.023 --> 04:13:28.359
OPERATE AND WILL OPERATE AS

04:13:28.426 --> 04:13:29.727
RESPONSIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES.

04:13:29.794 --> 04:13:31.863
SO OUR BILL IS WORK IN PROGRESS

04:13:31.930 --> 04:13:33.231
IT'S NOT COMPLETE.

04:13:33.298 --> 04:13:34.165
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

04:13:34.232 --> 04:13:35.300

04:13:35.366 --> 04:13:36.768

SEEK TO PROTECT.

04:13:44.175 --> 04:13:44.876
NOT ONLY IN THIS BILL BUT THAT

04:13:44.943 --> 04:13:46.077
THE SUPREME COURT SOUGHT TO

04:13:46.144 --> 04:13:46.644

THE HOOK FOR INDUSTRIES IN FOR

04:13:51.149 --> 04:13:53.051
BIG BUSINESSES THEY REFUSE TO

04:13:53.117 --> 04:13:55.653
ADEQUATELY PAID THEIR WORKERS.

04:13:55.720 --> 04:13:57.455
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

04:13:57.522 --> 04:14:00.491

WE HAVE TO RELY ON EMERGENCY

04:14:09.567 --> 04:14:10.835
ROOM CARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

04:14:10.902 --> 04:14:12.236
HAVE HEALTH CARE.

04:14:12.303 --> 04:14:13.771
IN SO MANY OF THESE WORKERS ARE

04:14:13.838 --> 04:14:14.606
MISCLASSIFIED AND THAT'S A

04:14:14.672 --> 04:14:16.374

PAYING ALL THE FEES [inaudible]

04:18:57.889 --> 04:19:01.192
INSURANCES BARNES AND HIRING.

04:19:01.259 --> 04:19:02.960
APPROPRIATE CONTRACTORS WOULD

04:19:03.027 --> 04:19:06.697

HIS DESTROY ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

04:19:14.505 --> 04:19:16.707
THAT WOULD BE CRIMINAL.

04:19:16.774 --> 04:19:18.509
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS THE BACKBONE

04:19:18.576 --> 04:19:19.210
OF THE SMALL BUSINESS

04:19:19.277 --> 04:19:21.112
COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE TO BE

04:19:21.178 --> 04:19:25.449
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND EMBRACE.

04:19:25.516 --> 04:19:26.717
TAKING THE RISK [inaudible]

04:19:26.784 --> 04:19:28.986
NOT US.

04:19:29.053 --> 04:19:29.954
THEY'RE GOING OUT THERE AND

04:19:30.021 --> 04:19:31.155
PUTTING THEIR CAPITAL AND THEIR

04:19:31.222 --> 04:19:34.058
LIVELIHOOD ON THE LINE EVERY DAY.

04:19:34.125 --> 04:19:35.393
AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN

04:19:35.459 --> 04:19:37.094
SUPPORT THESE BUSINESSES.

04:19:37.161 --> 04:19:39.297
WITH THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF

04:19:39.363 --> 04:19:41.198

JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.

04:19:53.945 --> 04:19:55.813
I DO NOT SUPPORT THE UNDERGROUND

INAPPROPRIATE MANNERS.

04:20:03.087 --> 04:20:04.822
I WANT THIS LEGISLATURE TO

04:20:04.889 --> 04:20:05.990
UNDERSTAND.

04:20:06.057 --> 04:20:07.525
THE SMALL BUSINESS MATTERS AND

04:20:07.591 --> 04:20:08.326

04:20:57.074 --> 04:20:58.743
AFTER DOT NET DECISION CAME OUT

04:20:58.809 --> 04:20:59.243
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF

04:20:59.310 --> 04:21:00.811
CONFUSION AND MANY OF MY

I RAISE THOSE CONCERNS EARLY ON

04:21:04.148 --> 04:21:05.282
ABOUT HOW THIS LAW WOULD AFFECT

I APPLAUD LABOR BUSINESS FOR

COMING TOGETHER AND WORKING ON A

04:21:11.722 --> 04:21:13.457
COMPROMISE BILL.

04:21:13.524 --> 04:21:14.358

OUR COMMUNITIES HOWEVER LET'S

04:21:16.494 --> 04:21:17.895
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY HELP WITH

04:21:17.962 --> 04:21:19.196
THE BROADER EXEMPTION LANGUAGE

04:21:19.263 --> 04:21:20.031
WHEN THE BILL RETURNS IN THE

04:21:20.097 --> 04:21:21.732
SENATE TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE.

04:21:21.799 --> 04:21:25.136
RIVER LEE INCLUDED IN THIS

04:21:25.202 --> 04:21:27.872
DECISION [inaudible]

04:21:27.938 --> 04:21:29.073
MR OBERNOLTE.

04:21:29.140 --> 04:21:30.141
MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN

04:21:30.207 --> 04:21:33.310
OPPOSITION TO AB -- FIVE I

04:21:33.377 --> 04:21:34.645
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR

04:21:34.712 --> 04:21:37.014
THAT THIS IS AN ACTION THAT.

04:21:37.081 --> 04:21:39.650
THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO TAKE.

04:21:39.717 --> 04:21:41.419
I THOUGHT WAS VERY INAPPROPRIATE

04:21:41.485 --> 04:21:43.687
FOR THE SUPREME COURT TO ATTEMPT

04:21:43.754 --> 04:21:45.222
TO LEGISLATE THIS ISSUE AND IT'S

04:21:45.289 --> 04:21:46.457
VERY APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE

04:21:46.524 --> 04:21:47.625
TAKING THIS ACTION.

04:21:47.691 --> 04:21:49.960
HOWEVER I HAVE SOME DIRE

04:21:50.027 --> 04:21:51.762
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE LANGUAGE

04:21:51.829 --> 04:21:53.064
IN THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN

04:21:53.130 --> 04:21:54.698
WOULD MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA

04:21:54.765 --> 04:21:55.266
BUSINESSES.

04:21:55.332 --> 04:21:56.567
AND I'D LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE MY

04:21:56.634 --> 04:21:59.003
CONCERNS WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM MY

04:21:59.070 --> 04:22:00.604
OWN LIFE MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT.

04:22:00.671 --> 04:22:01.639
I OWN A VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT

04:22:01.705 --> 04:22:03.174
STUDIO YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW I

04:22:03.240 --> 04:22:04.842
STARTED THAT STUDIO THIRTY YEARS

04:22:04.909 --> 04:22:06.944
AGO OUT OF MY DORM ROOM AT CAL

04:22:07.011 --> 04:22:07.144
TECH.

04:22:07.211 --> 04:22:08.446
I ANSWER ONE ADD ON A BULLETIN

04:22:08.512 --> 04:22:10.047
BOARD I STARTED WRITING VIDEO

04:22:10.114 --> 04:22:11.248
GAMES AND THIS WAS AT A TIME

04:22:11.315 --> 04:22:12.483
WHEN THE GAMES WERE SIMPLE IT

04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:14.051
WAS POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO

04:22:14.118 --> 04:22:14.952
DO EVERYTHING.

04:22:15.019 --> 04:22:16.153
SO I TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING I

04:22:16.220 --> 04:22:17.588
DID THE THINGS THAT I WAS GOOD

04:22:17.655 --> 04:22:19.757
AT THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAMMING

04:22:19.824 --> 04:22:20.825
I DID THE THINGS I WAS NOT GOOD

04:22:20.891 --> 04:22:22.860
AT THE ART THE ANIMATION AND I

04:22:22.927 --> 04:22:23.627
DID THE THINGS.

04:22:23.694 --> 04:22:24.462
I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I

04:22:24.528 --> 04:22:25.896
WAS TERRIBLE AT I TRIED TO DO

04:22:25.963 --> 04:22:27.264
THE SOUND THE MUSIC MYSELF.

04:22:27.331 --> 04:22:28.933
AND MY PUBLISHER CAME BACK TO ME

04:22:28.999 --> 04:22:29.500
THEY SAID THIS GAME YOU'RE

04:22:29.567 --> 04:22:31.001
WRITING IT'S FANTASTIC IT'S

04:22:31.068 --> 04:22:33.571
REALLY FUN TO PLAY WITH THE

04:22:33.637 --> 04:22:35.506
MUSIC IS HORRIBLE.

04:22:35.573 --> 04:22:36.674
AND SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MAYBE

04:22:36.740 --> 04:22:37.308
THIS ISN'T AN OPERABLE BUSINESS

04:22:37.374 --> 04:22:38.876
STRATEGY TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF

04:22:38.943 --> 04:22:40.611
SO I FOUND ANOTHER STUDENT.

04:22:40.678 --> 04:22:42.213
WHO ACTUALLY HAD SOME TALENT IN

04:22:42.279 --> 04:22:44.281
MUSIC AND ASKED THEM IF THEY'D

04:22:44.348 --> 04:22:45.182
LIKE TO MAKE A FEW DOLLARS

04:22:45.249 --> 04:22:46.617
WRITING THE MUSIC FOR MY GAME

04:22:46.684 --> 04:22:47.485
AND THEY DID AND THAT ACTUALLY

04:22:47.551 --> 04:22:49.120
LEAD TO A WHOLE CAREER FOR THEM?

04:22:49.186 --> 04:22:50.754
WRITING MUSIC AND VIDEO GAMES

04:22:50.821 --> 04:22:52.490
AND IT LED TO ME MAKING AN

04:22:52.556 --> 04:22:53.824
ACCEPTABLE GAME IN THE NEXT GAME

04:22:53.891 --> 04:22:54.458
I WROTE.

04:22:54.525 --> 04:22:55.960
I CONTRACTED OUT A LITTLE BIT

04:22:56.026 --> 04:22:56.861
MORE OF THE STUFF THAT I WASN'T

04:22:56.927 --> 04:22:57.995
GOOD AT AND THEN AS WE GOT

04:22:58.062 --> 04:22:58.796
BIGGER OVER THE YEARS I

04:22:58.863 --> 04:23:00.097
CONTRACTED OUT SOME OF THE

04:23:00.164 --> 04:23:01.532
THINGS THAT I WAS GOOD AT AND

04:23:01.599 --> 04:23:02.800
THEN EVENTUALLY WE GOT BIG

04:23:02.867 --> 04:23:04.101
ENOUGH AND STABLE ENOUGH THAT WE

04:23:04.168 --> 04:23:04.869
COULD OPEN.

04:23:04.935 --> 04:23:06.270
A BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION TO

04:23:06.337 --> 04:23:07.238
BRING PEOPLE ON HIS EMPLOYEES

04:23:07.304 --> 04:23:08.706
AND NOW THIRTY YEARS LATER WE

04:23:08.772 --> 04:23:09.874
DON'T DO ANY OUTSOURCING AT ALL

04:23:09.940 --> 04:23:11.509
ALL OF OUR WORK IS DONE BY OUR

04:23:11.575 --> 04:23:12.143
EMPLOYEES.

04:23:12.209 --> 04:23:15.379
BUT IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN TODAY

04:23:15.446 --> 04:23:16.280
AND THE CURRENT DYNAMICS

04:23:16.347 --> 04:23:18.182
DECISION WAS THE LAW OF THE LAND

04:23:18.249 --> 04:23:19.583
IN CALIFORNIA.

04:23:19.650 --> 04:23:20.951
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

04:23:21.018 --> 04:23:23.621
SUBCONTRACT ANY OF THAT INITIAL

04:23:23.687 --> 04:23:25.156
GAME THAT I WROTE BECAUSE IT

04:23:25.222 --> 04:23:26.590
WOULD VIOLATE THE SO CALLED B.

04:23:26.657 --> 04:23:27.491
PILLAR.

04:23:27.558 --> 04:23:28.792
IN THE DYNAMICS DECISION WHICH

04:23:28.859 --> 04:23:30.594
SAYS THAT THE WORK THAT YOU

04:23:30.661 --> 04:23:32.496
CONTRACT CANNOT BE RELATED TO

04:23:32.563 --> 04:23:33.664
THE CORE BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE

04:23:33.731 --> 04:23:35.366
PERFORMING AND CERTAINLY DOING

04:23:35.432 --> 04:23:36.967
MUSIC FOR A GAME OR ANIMATION

04:23:37.034 --> 04:23:38.169
FOR GAME IS RELATED.

04:23:38.235 --> 04:23:39.170
SO I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

04:23:39.236 --> 04:23:39.870
DO THAT.

04:23:39.937 --> 04:23:41.705
AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WHAT

04:23:41.772 --> 04:23:42.806
I WOULD HAVE BEEN LOTS OF A LOST

04:23:42.873 --> 04:23:44.208
MY CONTRACT FOR THAT FIRST GAME.

04:23:44.275 --> 04:23:48.012
AND MY COMPANY WOULD NOT EXIST

04:23:48.078 --> 04:23:48.812
TODAY.

04:23:48.879 --> 04:23:50.047
AND THE MARKET HITS AVOID SO MY

04:23:50.114 --> 04:23:50.714
COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN STARTED

04:23:50.781 --> 04:23:52.283
BY SOMEBODY ELSE.

04:23:52.349 --> 04:23:53.517
BUT IN A DIFFERENT STATE OTHER

04:23:53.584 --> 04:23:55.186
THAN CALIFORNIA AND HUNDREDS OF

04:23:55.252 --> 04:23:56.854
JOBS OF MY COMPANIES GENERATED

04:23:56.921 --> 04:23:57.955
OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OF

04:23:58.022 --> 04:23:59.023
WILL HAVE BEEN LOST.

04:23:59.089 --> 04:24:00.758
AND I WOULD HAVE A PRETTY MINOR

04:24:00.824 --> 04:24:02.726
CONSEQUENCE FOR CALIFORNIA BUT

04:24:02.793 --> 04:24:04.461
OTHER START UPS THAT HAVE FOUND --

04:24:04.528 --> 04:24:06.764
THEIR THEIR GENESIS HERE THAT

04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:07.898
WOULD NOT BE SO MINOR I'M

04:24:07.965 --> 04:24:08.832
TALKING ABOUT COMPANIES LIKE

04:24:08.899 --> 04:24:11.802
APPLE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK.

04:24:11.869 --> 04:24:12.803
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE

04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:14.171
CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO HONOR

04:24:14.238 --> 04:24:15.739
THAT SPIRIT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL

04:24:15.806 --> 04:24:17.374
ISM THAT WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND

04:24:17.441 --> 04:24:18.676
UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THAT THIS

04:24:18.742 --> 04:24:20.377
BILL IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

04:24:20.444 --> 04:24:21.812
THAT WOULD NOT BE TRUE.

04:24:21.879 --> 04:24:23.414
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

04:24:23.480 --> 04:24:24.615
THREE THINGS AS AS BILL MOVES

04:24:24.682 --> 04:24:26.617
FORWARD FIRST OF ALL IT'S VERY

04:24:26.684 --> 04:24:26.917
CLEAR TO ME.

04:24:26.984 --> 04:24:29.520
THAT -- THE DEFINITION OF

04:24:29.587 --> 04:24:30.854
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES NEED TO BE

04:24:30.921 --> 04:24:32.957
EXPANDED SO THE AUTHORS ACTUALLY

04:24:33.023 --> 04:24:34.091
BEEN VERY CONSCIENTIOUS SHE'S

04:24:34.158 --> 04:24:35.926
BEEN VERY DILIGENT ABOUT TAKING

04:24:35.993 --> 04:24:37.628
A LOOK AT THESE ISSUES.

04:24:37.695 --> 04:24:39.396
LAST WEEK THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT

04:24:39.463 --> 04:24:40.698
TO THE BILL THAT ADDED AN

04:24:40.764 --> 04:24:41.799
EXEMPTION FOR PROFESSIONAL

04:24:41.865 --> 04:24:43.601
SERVICES BUT IT'S WORDED VERY

04:24:43.667 --> 04:24:45.102
NARROWLY IT'S ONLY IF YOU HAVE.

04:24:45.169 --> 04:24:46.737
A LICENSE FROM THE STATE OF

04:24:46.804 --> 04:24:47.605
CALIFORNIA.

04:24:47.671 --> 04:24:48.806
OR IF YOU'RE IN THE PRESS THE

04:24:48.872 --> 04:24:50.808
FIELDS OF HUMAN RESOURCES ARE

04:24:50.874 --> 04:24:51.942
MARKETING.

04:24:52.009 --> 04:24:53.010
AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MY

04:24:53.077 --> 04:24:54.278
INDUSTRY WOULD BE VERY INSULTED

04:24:54.345 --> 04:24:55.446
IF WE TOLD THEM THAT THEY

04:24:55.512 --> 04:24:56.780
WEREN'T PROFESSIONALS I THINK WE

04:24:56.847 --> 04:24:58.449
NEED TO BROADEN THAT. TO INCLUDE

04:24:58.515 --> 04:25:01.151
PEOPLE THAT DO HIGHLY SKILLED

04:25:01.218 --> 04:25:03.220
WORK AND A DEGREE OF ADVANCED

04:25:03.287 --> 04:25:04.955
DEGREES INDICATION OF THAT BUT

04:25:05.022 --> 04:25:06.257
IS NOT A REQUIREMENT OF THAT.

04:25:06.323 --> 04:25:07.858
I ALSO THINK THAT THIS BILL

04:25:07.925 --> 04:25:10.227
NEEDS A AN EXEMPTION FOR SMALL

04:25:10.294 --> 04:25:11.795
BUSINESS IF YOU HAVE NOT VERY

04:25:11.862 --> 04:25:13.063
MANY EMPLOYEES MAYBE LESS THAN A

04:25:13.130 --> 04:25:14.365
MILLION DOLLARS GROSS REVENUE

04:25:14.431 --> 04:25:17.268
LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES --

04:25:17.334 --> 04:25:18.469
I IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

04:25:18.535 --> 04:25:20.304
TO COMPLY WITH THE RESTRICTIONS

04:25:20.371 --> 04:25:21.605
PLACED IN THIS BILL I KNOW THAT

04:25:21.672 --> 04:25:23.240
WHEN I WAS IN MY DORM ROOM

04:25:23.307 --> 04:25:24.074
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD HAVE

04:25:24.141 --> 04:25:24.708
HIRED AN EMPLOYEE I DIDN'T KNOW

04:25:24.775 --> 04:25:25.576
ANYTHING ABOUT.

04:25:25.643 --> 04:25:26.577
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OUR

04:25:26.644 --> 04:25:28.312
WORKERS COMPENSATION -- WAGE

04:25:28.379 --> 04:25:30.614
LAWS -- BENEFITS OR VACATION

04:25:30.681 --> 04:25:31.915
TIME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT

04:25:31.982 --> 04:25:33.284
WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE SO I

04:25:33.350 --> 04:25:34.351
THINK WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO TAKE

04:25:34.418 --> 04:25:35.919
A LOOK AT THAT TO MAKE SURE THE

04:25:35.986 --> 04:25:36.387
PEOPLE CAN STILL START

04:25:36.453 --> 04:25:37.488
BUSINESSES HERE.

04:25:37.554 --> 04:25:38.789
AND LASTLY I THINK THAT THIS

04:25:38.856 --> 04:25:40.324
BILL BADLY NEEDS A BUSINESS TO

04:25:40.391 --> 04:25:41.725
BUSINESS EXEMPTION.

04:25:41.792 --> 04:25:42.593
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN

04:25:42.660 --> 04:25:43.861
CALIFORNIA THAT ENJOY BEING

04:25:43.927 --> 04:25:45.429
EMPLOYEES BUT THERE ARE ALSO

04:25:45.496 --> 04:25:46.830
SOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

04:25:46.897 --> 04:25:48.299
LIKE BEING INDEPENDENT

04:25:48.365 --> 04:25:49.366
CONTRACTORS.

04:25:49.433 --> 04:25:50.434
AND IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE

04:25:50.501 --> 04:25:51.669
PEOPLE AND YOU'VE TAKEN THE

04:25:51.735 --> 04:25:54.071
TROUBLE TO INCORPORATE YOUR OWN

04:25:54.138 --> 04:25:56.640
COMPANY OR TO USE VIOLENCE A DBA

04:25:56.707 --> 04:25:57.841
AND DO BUSINESS AS A SOLE

04:25:57.908 --> 04:25:59.243
PROPRIETORSHIP IF YOU HAVE A

04:25:59.310 --> 04:26:00.210
BUSINESS LICENSE.

04:26:00.277 --> 04:26:01.712
THEN I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE

04:26:01.779 --> 04:26:03.814
THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE

04:26:03.881 --> 04:26:05.182
THEIR CURRENT MODE OF WORKING.

04:26:05.249 --> 04:26:06.550
SO I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A WORK

04:26:06.617 --> 04:26:07.951
IN PROGRESS THIS IS DEFINITELY

04:26:08.018 --> 04:26:09.586
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ACT ON

04:26:09.653 --> 04:26:13.390
BUT I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS WITH

04:26:13.457 --> 04:26:13.991
THE BILL IS CURRENTLY WORDED I

04:26:14.058 --> 04:26:17.528

04:26:17.594 --> 04:26:19.363
MISTER DALLI YOUR RECOGNIZE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS

04:26:20.064 --> 04:26:22.633
I TOO MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION.

04:26:22.700 --> 04:26:23.901
THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPACT MY OWN

04:26:23.967 --> 04:26:25.402
BUSINESS.

04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:27.371
I ALONG WITH MY CALLING FROM BIG

04:26:27.438 --> 04:26:28.739
BEAR HAD THE SAME.

04:26:28.806 --> 04:26:31.575
SITUATION WE HARVEST OUR CROPS.

04:26:31.642 --> 04:26:32.743
AND IN TIME WE NEED TO HARVEST

04:26:32.810 --> 04:26:34.645
THOSE CROPS WE HAVE TO GET ABOUT

04:26:34.712 --> 04:26:35.813
A CERTAIN TIME BEFORE THE

04:26:35.879 --> 04:26:36.213
WEATHER CHANGES.

04:26:36.280 --> 04:26:37.047
AND SO.

04:26:37.114 --> 04:26:38.215
UNFORTUNATELY I AM IN THE

04:26:38.282 --> 04:26:39.350
TRUCKING BUSINESS BECAUSE I

04:26:39.416 --> 04:26:41.552
COULDN'T GET TRUCKS WHEN I

04:26:41.618 --> 04:26:42.086
NEEDED TRUCKS TO MOVE MY

04:26:42.152 --> 04:26:43.487

04:26:43.554 --> 04:26:44.988
AND AT THAT TIME IN YOUR WEEK.

04:26:45.055 --> 04:26:46.256
HIGHER ON INDEPENDENT

04:26:46.323 --> 04:26:48.158
CONTRACTORS -- AND WE MAY

04:26:48.225 --> 04:26:49.626
ACTUALLY OWN THE TRAILER AND

04:26:49.693 --> 04:26:51.061
THEY BRING THE POWER UNIT IN THE

04:26:51.128 --> 04:26:52.196
TRACTOR.

04:26:52.262 --> 04:26:53.597
TO PULL OUR COMMODITIES IN SO

04:26:53.664 --> 04:26:54.765
THIS ONE AREA THAT'S GOING TO

04:26:54.832 --> 04:26:56.133

DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO IRON OUT

04:27:04.108 --> 04:27:05.976
SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- BUT

04:27:06.043 --> 04:27:07.778
SMALL BUSINESSES REALLY NEEDED

04:27:07.845 --> 04:27:09.513
TO HAVE A BREAK IN THIS AREA.

04:27:09.580 --> 04:27:12.249
AND NUMBER -- TWO ALSO I CHECKED

04:27:12.316 --> 04:27:13.884

FOLKS IN THE WORLD OF THE LAW

04:27:26.897 --> 04:27:28.098
THAT WILL BE GOING AFTER

04:27:28.165 --> 04:27:29.733
BUSINESSES WHO AT THAT TIME

04:27:29.800 --> 04:27:30.434
THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING THE

04:27:30.501 --> 04:27:31.368
RIGHT THING.

04:27:31.435 --> 04:27:33.070

THAT WE ARE PROTECTING WORKERS

04:30:52.903 --> 04:30:55.238

ALLOWING WAGE THEFT.

04:30:56.273 --> 04:30:57.374
AND OTHER ATROCITIES THAT

04:30:57.441 --> 04:30:58.709

INDUSTRIES THAT ARE DEMANDING --

04:32:39.342 --> 04:32:41.344

DEBATE MRS ALL SHE MAKE CLOTHES.

04:32:54.691 --> 04:32:55.292
AND CLOSE I JUST WANT TO BRING

04:32:55.358 --> 04:32:55.926
LIGHT TO A COUPLE THINGS THAT

04:32:55.992 --> 04:32:57.561
WERE SAID BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE.

04:32:57.627 --> 04:32:59.029
CONFUSED BY SOME COMMENTS AND I

04:32:59.096 --> 04:33:01.064
I FEAR THAT PEOPLE DON'T

04:33:01.131 --> 04:33:02.499
UNDERSTAND NUMBER ONE THE

04:33:02.566 --> 04:33:04.034
DYNAMICS RULING AND WHAT IT

04:33:04.101 --> 04:33:05.569
MEANS TO PUT IT INTO LAW.

04:33:05.635 --> 04:33:07.571
NOTHING IN DYNAMAX OR IN LAW

04:33:07.637 --> 04:33:10.006
WILL PREVENT -- TEN NINETY NINE

04:33:10.073 --> 04:33:11.274
INTERACTIONS I MEAN THERE ARE

04:33:11.341 --> 04:33:12.676
ACTUALLY VALID INDEPENDENT

04:33:12.743 --> 04:33:14.578
CONTRACTORS THERE ARE VALID

04:33:14.644 --> 04:33:16.146
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT INTERACT

04:33:16.213 --> 04:33:18.048
WITH OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES AND

04:33:18.115 --> 04:33:20.951
AND MAY PAGE OTHER THROUGH A TEN

04:33:21.017 --> 04:33:21.485
NINETY NINE THIS WILL NOT

04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:22.486
PREVENT THAT THERE IS A

04:33:22.552 --> 04:33:23.820
CONTRACTOR SUBCONTRACTOR

04:33:23.887 --> 04:33:25.188
RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL NOT

04:33:25.255 --> 04:33:26.089
CHANGE.

04:33:26.156 --> 04:33:27.023
SO THE LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE

04:33:27.090 --> 04:33:29.192
BROUGHT UP TODAY I THINK --

04:33:29.259 --> 04:33:30.861
COULD BE RESOLVED IF MEMBERS

04:33:30.927 --> 04:33:32.195
WOULD LIKE TO COME TO MY OFFICE

04:33:32.262 --> 04:33:33.363
AND SIT DOWN WITH ME WE CAN HAVE

04:33:33.430 --> 04:33:34.698
THESE DISCUSSIONS I REALLY AYE

04:33:34.765 --> 04:33:35.866
EVERYBODY WAS ASKED FOR IT I

04:33:35.932 --> 04:33:37.200
I'VE TRIED.

04:33:37.267 --> 04:33:40.070
TO ACCOMMODATE -- AS PART OF THE

04:33:40.137 --> 04:33:42.339
PERSONAL CARE INDUSTRY THAT --

04:33:42.405 --> 04:33:43.874
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES

04:33:43.940 --> 04:33:45.408
PRODUCT WE I THINK WE OUTLINED

04:33:45.475 --> 04:33:47.477
PRETTY CLEARLY WHAT THAT'S GOING

04:33:47.544 --> 04:33:48.879
TO LOOK LIKE FOR HAIR STYLIST WE

04:33:48.945 --> 04:33:51.148
DO PLAN. TO TO BROADEN NOT IN

04:33:51.214 --> 04:33:53.617
THE PERSONAL CARE -- INDUSTRY WE

04:33:53.683 --> 04:33:55.018
WE STARTED WITH HERE SALAS

04:33:55.085 --> 04:33:55.619
BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S EXISTING

04:33:55.685 --> 04:33:57.387
WAGE ORDER LIKE EVERYTHING WE

04:33:57.454 --> 04:33:58.922
STARTED WITH IT IT'S THINGS THAT

04:33:58.989 --> 04:34:00.157
ARE IN EXISTING WAGE ORDERS

04:34:00.223 --> 04:34:01.091
WHETHER THEY'RE DOCTORS OR

04:34:01.158 --> 04:34:05.829
INSURANCE AGENT SO.

04:34:05.896 --> 04:34:07.364
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FROM THAT.

04:34:07.430 --> 04:34:08.165
ASPECT IN ASK THINGS ARE BROUGHT

04:34:08.231 --> 04:34:09.733
FOR WE CONTINUED TO WORK ON THIS.

04:34:09.800 --> 04:34:10.834
THE WHEN IT COMES TO TRUCK

04:34:10.901 --> 04:34:11.902
DRIVERS I THINK WE HAVE TO SAY

04:34:11.968 --> 04:34:13.770
THIS THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

04:34:13.837 --> 04:34:15.372
I HAVE TO BE HONEST PROBABLY THE

04:34:15.438 --> 04:34:16.706
MOST DIFFICULT ISSUE.

04:34:16.773 --> 04:34:19.810
I'VE EVER TRIED TO DEAL WITH AND

04:34:19.876 --> 04:34:21.645
THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE

04:34:21.711 --> 04:34:22.445
QUITE FRANKLY THE DYNAMICS

04:34:22.512 --> 04:34:23.747
DECISION DON'T WITH TRUCK

04:34:23.814 --> 04:34:25.348
DRIVERS WE KNOW THAT IT'S WHEN

04:34:25.415 --> 04:34:27.184
THE MOST MISCLASSIFIED

04:34:27.250 --> 04:34:28.385
INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE OF

04:34:28.451 --> 04:34:29.486
CALIFORNIA.

04:34:29.553 --> 04:34:31.254
ABOUT 82% A POOR TRUCK DRIVERS

04:34:31.321 --> 04:34:32.455
ARE CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT

04:34:32.522 --> 04:34:34.558
CONTRACTORS AND WE KNOW ABOUT

04:34:34.624 --> 04:34:36.059
80% OF OUR MISCLASSIFIED.

04:34:36.126 --> 04:34:39.329
SO HOW WE MAKE EXEMPTIONS OR IF

04:34:39.396 --> 04:34:40.897
WE DO FOR INDEPENDENT -- OWNER

04:34:40.964 --> 04:34:42.599
OPERATORS WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR

04:34:42.666 --> 04:34:43.700
THAT WE'RE NOT JUST PROVIDING

04:34:43.767 --> 04:34:45.669
ANOTHER AVENUE BY WHICH

04:34:45.735 --> 04:34:48.038
COMPANIES CAN CONTINUE.

04:34:48.104 --> 04:34:49.873
BASICALLY ARE AT PREVENTS

04:34:49.940 --> 04:34:51.541
WORKERS FROM BEING ABLE TO BE

04:34:51.608 --> 04:34:52.976
HAVE A SUSTAINABLE LIFE.

04:34:53.043 --> 04:34:54.511
ANDSO -- THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY

04:34:54.578 --> 04:34:56.313
IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN COMPLEX

04:34:56.379 --> 04:34:57.380
IT'S BEEN TOUGH I I HAVE

04:34:57.447 --> 04:34:58.515
PROMISED AND WILL CONTINUE TO

04:34:58.582 --> 04:35:00.217
WORK ON THIS I I WANT TO GET

04:35:00.283 --> 04:35:01.318
THERE AND I DON'T WANT ANYONE

04:35:01.384 --> 04:35:02.886
WHO'S INVESTED A HUNDRED

04:35:02.953 --> 04:35:04.087
THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO A TRUCK.

04:35:04.154 --> 04:35:05.322
TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE THAT TRUCK

04:35:05.388 --> 04:35:07.090
I AM COMMITTED TO GETTING TO

04:35:07.157 --> 04:35:08.658
SOMETHING ON TRUCKERS BUT I WANT

04:35:08.725 --> 04:35:09.993
PEOPLETO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW

04:35:10.060 --> 04:35:14.130
COMPLEX THIS IS DYNAMICS WAS

04:35:14.197 --> 04:35:14.698
WRITTEN BECAUSE THE TRUCKING

04:35:14.764 --> 04:35:15.498
INDUSTRY.

04:35:15.565 --> 04:35:16.900
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THE DECISION

04:35:16.967 --> 04:35:17.434
ITSELF IS IMPORTANT WE'RE

04:35:17.500 --> 04:35:18.468
TALKING I'M A ONE MORE THING

04:35:18.535 --> 04:35:19.836
JUST TO BE CLEAR BUSINESS TO

04:35:19.903 --> 04:35:21.137
BUSINESS INTERACTION AND WE CAN

04:35:21.204 --> 04:35:22.806
CLARIFY THIS IN THE SENATE THERE

04:35:22.873 --> 04:35:23.440
IS NOTHING THAT WILL PREVENT A

04:35:23.506 --> 04:35:26.309
BIT OF A GENUINE SMALL BUSINESS.

04:35:26.376 --> 04:35:27.878
FROM FROM CONTRACTING WITH OR

04:35:27.944 --> 04:35:29.646
OUTSOURCING TWO A GENUINE SMALL

04:35:29.713 --> 04:35:31.915
BUSINESS WHAT WE WANT TO PREVENT

04:35:31.982 --> 04:35:34.484
IS THIS DISTINCTION WHERE

04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:35.852
INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WHO TRULY

04:35:35.919 --> 04:35:37.387
AREN'T SMALL BUSINESSES.

04:35:37.454 --> 04:35:38.421
ARE BEING IDENTIFIED AS

04:35:38.488 --> 04:35:40.390
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND

04:35:40.457 --> 04:35:41.658
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY.

04:35:41.725 --> 04:35:42.659
AND THAT SHOULD WORRY YOU

04:35:42.726 --> 04:35:45.128
BECAUSE IT COST ALL OF YOUR

04:35:45.195 --> 04:35:47.597
CONSTITUENTS IT COST US ALL.

04:35:47.664 --> 04:35:48.932
BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T

04:35:48.999 --> 04:35:50.267
HAVE HEALTH CARE AND THEY'RE

04:35:50.333 --> 04:35:52.135
HURT ON THE JOB IN THEIR IN

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.

04:35:53.770 --> 04:35:56.106
BECAUSE THE MERCHANTS THE ROOM

04:35:56.172 --> 04:35:56.873
AND WE ALL PAY FOR THAT.

04:35:56.940 --> 04:35:58.041
WHEN SOMEBODY LOSES THEIR JOB AS

04:35:58.108 --> 04:35:58.575
AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

04:35:58.642 --> 04:36:00.443
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ZERO

04:36:00.510 --> 04:36:01.811
PROTECTIONS THEY DON'T HAVE

04:36:01.878 --> 04:36:03.580
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND WE

ALL PAY FOR THE SERVICES THAT

04:36:05.882 --> 04:36:07.317
THEY HAVE TO RELY ON?

04:36:07.384 --> 04:36:08.818
WHEN SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE PAID

04:36:08.885 --> 04:36:10.253
FAMILY LEAVE OUR PAID SICK LEAVE

04:36:10.320 --> 04:36:11.421

SOMETIME HAVE TO RELY ON WELFARE

04:36:13.823 --> 04:36:15.926
OR FOOD STAMPS SUBSIDIZED

04:36:15.992 --> 04:36:17.661
HOUSING FREE LUNCH FOR THEIR

KIDS WE ALL PAY FOR THAT?

04:36:20.030 --> 04:36:20.997
IN SOME OF THE COMPANIES

04:36:21.064 --> 04:36:22.132
ENGAGING IN THIS TYPE OF

04:36:22.198 --> 04:36:24.100
BEHAVIOR WHO ARE REFUSING TO

04:36:24.167 --> 04:36:25.902
TREAT THEIR WORKERS THE WAY WE

04:36:25.969 --> 04:36:27.704
EXPECT EMPLOYERS TO TREAT

04:36:27.771 --> 04:36:29.472
WORKERS IN THE SOCIAL CONTRACT

04:36:29.539 --> 04:36:30.640
THAT WE HAVE.

04:36:30.707 --> 04:36:31.942
BETWEEN EMPLOYMENT WORKERS AND

04:36:32.008 --> 04:36:33.176
TAXPAYERS SOME OF THOSE

04:36:33.243 --> 04:36:36.880
COMPANIES ARE DOING JUST FINE.

04:36:36.947 --> 04:36:39.015
THEIR CEOS MAKING BILLIONS OF

04:36:39.082 --> 04:36:41.851
DOLLARS.

04:36:41.918 --> 04:36:43.954
WHILE WE'RE SUBSIDIZING AS

04:36:44.020 --> 04:36:45.622
TAXPAYERS THEIR WORKERS.

04:36:45.689 --> 04:36:47.324
THERE IS SOMETHING CRITICALLY

04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:48.892
WRONG WITH THAT SO AS WE MOVE

04:36:48.959 --> 04:36:51.661
FORWARD AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK

04:36:51.728 --> 04:36:53.964
THIS OUT IN EVERY ASPECT THAT IT.

04:36:54.030 --> 04:36:55.165
ALL AND ANY OF YOU WANT TO TALK

04:36:55.231 --> 04:36:56.833
ABOUT THOSE THAT WE CAN MAKE WE

04:36:56.900 --> 04:36:59.235
WILL MAKE.

04:36:59.302 --> 04:37:01.071
WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

04:37:01.137 --> 04:37:02.505
BECAUSE OUR CONSTITUENT

04:37:02.572 --> 04:37:04.407
TAXPAYERS DON'T DESERVE TO

04:37:04.474 --> 04:37:06.476
SUBSIDIZE BIG BUSINESS.

04:37:06.543 --> 04:37:08.311
AND IT QUITE HONESTLY WE HAVE TO

04:37:08.378 --> 04:37:09.846
ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY PLAYS BY

04:37:09.913 --> 04:37:13.283
THE SAME RULES.

04:37:13.350 --> 04:37:14.451
SO THIS IS A BILL THAT -- IT

04:37:14.517 --> 04:37:15.218
KIND OF CONFUSES ME WHEN PEOPLE

04:37:15.285 --> 04:37:16.953
SAY I HOPE YOU KEEP WORKING ON

04:37:17.020 --> 04:37:17.587
THIS BUT I HOPE YOU BOTH KNOW IF

04:37:17.654 --> 04:37:18.955
YOU WILL NO I CAN'T KEEP WORKING

04:37:19.022 --> 04:37:20.023
ON THIS.

04:37:20.090 --> 04:37:21.157
AND THAT MEANS THE DYNAMAX

04:37:21.224 --> 04:37:22.525
RULING STANDS.

04:37:22.592 --> 04:37:24.394
AND THE RETROACTIVITY COURT CASE

04:37:24.461 --> 04:37:26.663
STANDS AND THAT MEANS THERE ARE

04:37:26.730 --> 04:37:28.765
GOING TO BE A TON OF LAWSUITS.

04:37:28.832 --> 04:37:30.333
AND A TON ACOSTA BUSINESS.

04:37:30.400 --> 04:37:31.401

04:37:33.770 --> 04:37:34.738

09:29:25.631 --> 09:29:26.932
IT'S NOT RENT CONTROL BUT IT'S

09:29:26.999 --> 09:29:28.601
AN ANTI RENT GOUGING POLICY

09:29:28.667 --> 09:29:30.603
DESIGNED TO PROTECT MANY OF OUR

09:29:30.669 --> 09:29:32.204
STATES FIFTEEN MILLION TENANTS

09:29:32.271 --> 09:29:33.873
WHO DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL.

09:29:33.939 --> 09:29:35.641
AGAINST THE MOST EGREGIOUS RENT

09:29:35.708 --> 09:29:36.342
INCREASES WHILE ALLOWING

09:29:36.408 --> 09:29:39.345
LANDLORDS TO MAKE A FAIR RETURN

09:29:39.411 --> 09:29:39.912
ON INVESTMENT.

09:29:39.979 --> 09:29:41.881
WE'VE ENGAGED IN MONTHS OF

09:29:41.947 --> 09:29:43.549
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION.

09:29:43.616 --> 09:29:44.884
AND AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED

09:29:44.950 --> 09:29:46.719
TO ANNOUNCE THAT AS OF SIX OH

09:29:46.785 --> 09:29:48.220
SEVEN PM TONIGHT.

09:29:48.287 --> 09:29:49.755
THE COALITION SUPPORTING MY BILL

09:29:49.822 --> 09:29:50.990
AND THE JUST BECAUSE BILL

09:29:51.056 --> 09:29:52.491
AUTHORED BY OUR COLLEAGUES FROM

09:29:52.558 --> 09:29:53.759
CONCORD IN OAKLAND.

09:29:53.826 --> 09:29:55.027
HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT ON

09:29:55.094 --> 09:29:57.062
AMENDMENTS TO BOTH BILLS THAT WE

09:29:57.129 --> 09:29:58.831
WILL BE DRAFTING AND AMENDING IN

09:29:58.898 --> 09:30:00.099
THE SENATE.

09:30:00.165 --> 09:30:01.767
FLORAL ART IS BEING CIRCULATED

09:30:01.834 --> 09:30:03.369
TO YOU AS WE SPEAK BUT I WANT TO

09:30:03.435 --> 09:30:04.904
READ THE FOR DEAL POINTS OF

09:30:04.970 --> 09:30:05.571
AGREEMENT.

09:30:05.638 --> 09:30:07.907
BETWEEN OUR COALITION IN THE

09:30:07.973 --> 09:30:09.341
REALTORS ON OUR BILL.

09:30:09.408 --> 09:30:11.744
FIRST THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A

09:30:11.810 --> 09:30:13.145
RENT CAP OF 7%.

09:30:13.212 --> 09:30:15.981
PLUS REGIONAL CPI WHICH IS UP

09:30:16.048 --> 09:30:17.650
FROM CPI PLUS 5%.

09:30:17.716 --> 09:30:18.651
THE BILL WOULD EXEMPT SMALL

09:30:18.717 --> 09:30:20.252
PROPERTY OWNERS WITH TEN OR

09:30:20.319 --> 09:30:21.954
FEWER SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED

09:30:22.021 --> 09:30:22.688
HOMES.

09:30:22.755 --> 09:30:24.056
IT WOULD ESTABLISH A SUNSET DATE

09:30:24.123 --> 09:30:26.358
OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH IS

09:30:26.425 --> 09:30:27.393
A THREE YEAR SUNSET DATE.

09:30:27.459 --> 09:30:28.761
AND WOULD CLEAN UP LANGUAGE ON

09:30:28.827 --> 09:30:31.764
VACANCY TO CONTROL OR MAKE OTHER

09:30:31.830 --> 09:30:33.198
TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. FOR THOSE

09:30:33.265 --> 09:30:33.933
OF YOU WONDER ABOUT THE

09:30:33.999 --> 09:30:35.968
IMPLICATIONS OF THE CPI PLUS

09:30:36.035 --> 09:30:37.570
SOME PERCENT CAP.

09:30:37.636 --> 09:30:39.138
WITH AN ANNUAL AVERAGE CPI

09:30:39.204 --> 09:30:40.072
INCREASE OF TWO AND A HALF

09:30:40.139 --> 09:30:41.206
PERCENT THE RENT GOUGING CAP

09:30:41.273 --> 09:30:42.641
WOULD AVERAGE BETWEEN NINE AND A

09:30:42.708 --> 09:30:43.809
HALF AND 10%.

09:30:43.876 --> 09:30:44.810
IT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DATA

09:30:44.877 --> 09:30:46.779
POINTS FIRST FOUR HUNDRED FORTY

09:30:46.845 --> 09:30:48.147
YEARS STATE LAWS PROHIBITED

09:30:48.213 --> 09:30:51.350
PRICE GOUGING ABOVE 10% AFTER AN

09:30:51.417 --> 09:30:52.918
EMERGENCY OR NATURAL DISASTER.

09:30:52.985 --> 09:30:54.587
SECONDLY THIS IS A PRECEDENT FOR

09:30:54.653 --> 09:30:56.155
STATEWIDE ANTI RENT GOUGING

09:30:56.221 --> 09:30:58.223
MEASURES SET JUST EARLIER THIS

09:30:58.290 --> 09:30:59.158
YEAR IN OREGON.

09:30:59.224 --> 09:31:01.360
THIRD FEDERAL DATA SHOWS THAT

09:31:01.427 --> 09:31:03.596
THIS LEVEL CPI PLUS 7% IS ON

09:31:03.662 --> 09:31:06.231
AVERAGE A HUNDRED AND 50% HIGHER

09:31:06.298 --> 09:31:07.733
THAN THE ANNUAL MEDIAN RENT

09:31:07.800 --> 09:31:09.468
INCREASE IN OUR STATE'S LARGEST

09:31:09.535 --> 09:31:10.436
REGIONS.

09:31:10.502 --> 09:31:11.670
AS SUCH WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

09:31:11.737 --> 09:31:13.172
A LEVEL TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO

09:31:13.238 --> 09:31:14.306
CALIFORNIA RENTERS SO THAT THEY

09:31:14.373 --> 09:31:16.008
WON'T RECEIVE AN EXORBITANT RENT

09:31:16.075 --> 09:31:18.410
INCREASE WHILE ALLOWING PROPERTY

09:31:18.477 --> 09:31:19.044
OWNERS TO MAKE A HEALTHY RETURN

09:31:19.111 --> 09:31:19.878
ON THEIR INVESTMENT.

09:31:19.945 --> 09:31:22.114
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S

09:31:22.181 --> 09:31:25.184
ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND RESPECT

09:31:25.250 --> 09:31:26.652
WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

09:31:26.719 --> 09:31:27.987
THANK YOU MISTER CHIU MISS WORKS

MATTER.

09:31:30.589 --> 09:31:31.090
THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND

09:31:31.156 --> 09:31:32.224
MEMBERS.

09:31:32.291 --> 09:31:33.459
WHEN I GOT ELECTED ONE OF THE

09:31:33.525 --> 09:31:35.227
FIRST THINGS I DID IN JANUARY AS

09:31:35.294 --> 09:31:37.696
I DID A LISTING CHORE -- AT ALL

09:31:37.763 --> 09:31:39.098
THAT HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS OF MY

09:31:39.164 --> 09:31:40.566
DISTRICT NOT ALL OF THEM THERE

09:31:40.633 --> 09:31:42.067
ARE MANY BUT I WENT TO A COUPLE

09:31:42.134 --> 09:31:45.471
I WENT TO ONE IN BERKELEY. ONE

09:31:45.537 --> 09:31:46.905
AND OPEN AND ONE IN RICHMOND.

09:31:46.972 --> 09:31:47.473
AND I TALKED TO A LOT OF THE

09:31:47.539 --> 09:31:48.007
FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

09:31:48.073 --> 09:31:49.174
HOMELESSNESS.

09:31:49.241 --> 09:31:50.509
AND THESE ARE JUST HEART

09:31:50.576 --> 09:31:52.111
BREAKING STORIES WHEN YOU TALK

09:31:52.177 --> 09:31:53.846
TO FOLKS WHO ARE SLEEPING

09:31:53.912 --> 09:31:55.147
OUTSIDE EVERY NIGHT.

09:31:55.214 --> 09:31:55.948
AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS

09:31:56.015 --> 09:31:57.750
HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE

09:31:57.816 --> 09:31:58.384
INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS TO THE

09:31:58.450 --> 09:32:00.119
THE HOMELESSNESS COUNTS JUST

09:32:00.185 --> 09:32:01.286
CAME BACK IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

09:32:01.353 --> 09:32:03.022
WE'VE WE'VE SEEN A 43% INCREASE

09:32:03.088 --> 09:32:04.390
IN HOMELESSNESS.

09:32:04.456 --> 09:32:06.458
AND I'M SURE THAT'S REFLECTED IN

09:32:06.525 --> 09:32:08.160
MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS AS WELL.

09:32:08.227 --> 09:32:09.595
THE DATA ALSO SHOWS THAT DATA

09:32:09.662 --> 09:32:10.729
SHOWS THAT OVER HALF OF THOSE

09:32:10.796 --> 09:32:11.563
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ECONOMICALLY

09:32:11.630 --> 09:32:14.166
DISPLACED.

09:32:14.233 --> 09:32:15.334
WE ALL BELIEVE.

09:32:15.401 --> 09:32:17.569
THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS.

09:32:17.636 --> 09:32:18.604
AND I KNOW THAT PART OF THAT

09:32:18.671 --> 09:32:20.205
SOLUTION IS BUILDING MORE HOMES

09:32:20.272 --> 09:32:21.707
AND I'VE BEEN A PROPONENT OF A

09:32:21.774 --> 09:32:22.808
LOT OF THE PRODUCTION

09:32:22.875 --> 09:32:23.709
LEGISLATION I'M CHAMPING

09:32:23.776 --> 09:32:25.210
PRODUCTION WITH THIS LEGISLATION

09:32:25.277 --> 09:32:26.912
MYSELF.

09:32:26.979 --> 09:32:27.980
THE SOLUTION ALSO WAS GUARDING

09:32:28.047 --> 09:32:30.082
AGAINST DISPLACEMENT.

09:32:30.149 --> 09:32:31.583
IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THIS BODY

09:32:31.650 --> 09:32:33.952
TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO STOP THIS

09:32:34.019 --> 09:32:34.586
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND THAT'S

09:32:34.653 --> 09:32:36.755
WHY MEASURES LIKE THIS THIS IS A

09:32:36.822 --> 09:32:37.690
MODERATE.

09:32:37.756 --> 09:32:39.692
COMMONSENSE BILL AND IS A CO

09:32:50.602 --> 09:32:52.438
DEAL THAT WE CAN ALL BELIEVE AND

09:32:52.504 --> 09:32:53.639
WE CAN ALL SUPPORT.

09:32:53.706 --> 09:32:54.973
THIS HAS A SUNSET IT'S ONLY FOR

09:32:55.040 --> 09:32:57.276
THREE YEARS.

09:32:57.342 --> 09:32:59.078
LANDLORDS CAN STILL INCREASED

09:32:59.144 --> 09:33:01.313
10% A YEAR OR SO IF THEY SO

09:33:01.380 --> 09:33:03.549

MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW THERE ARE

09:33:06.552 --> 09:33:07.753
MANY PEOPLE WHO THEY DON'T.

HAVE PENSIONS ARE RETIREMENTS

09:33:09.755 --> 09:33:10.089
ARE FOR ON CASE.

09:33:10.155 --> 09:33:11.924
THEY OWN A HOUSE THAT THEY RENT

09:33:11.990 --> 09:33:13.592
OUT OR UNIT OR TWO THAT THEY

09:33:13.659 --> 09:33:15.728
RENT OUT AND THAT'S THEIR INCOME

09:33:15.794 --> 09:33:17.129
THAT'S A RETIREMENT INCOME.

09:33:17.196 --> 09:33:18.397
THEY CAN STILL INCREASE RENTS

09:33:18.464 --> 09:33:19.998
EVERY SINGLE YEAR IT'S A VERY

09:33:20.065 --> 09:33:21.934
MODERATE MEASURE THAT WILL GUARD

09:33:22.000 --> 09:33:23.035
AGAINST SOME OF THE MORE

09:33:23.102 --> 09:33:24.536
EGREGIOUS PRACTICES THAT WERE

09:33:24.603 --> 09:33:25.270
SAYING.

09:33:25.337 --> 09:33:27.573
THAT 203-040-5060 PERCENT

09:33:27.639 --> 09:33:28.674
INCREASES THAT WERE SAYING IN

09:33:28.741 --> 09:33:29.942
OUR COMMUNITY THAT IS CAUSING

09:33:30.008 --> 09:33:31.844
THE DISPLACEMENT THAT WE SEE.

09:33:31.910 --> 09:33:32.444
SO I'M PROUD TO CALL FOR THIS

09:33:32.511 --> 09:33:33.378
BILL.

09:33:33.445 --> 09:33:34.947

[inaudible]

09:33:44.790 --> 09:33:47.326
THAT OBJECTION.

09:33:47.392 --> 09:33:51.530
WHAT IS RENT CONTROL?

09:33:51.597 --> 09:33:54.066
RENT CONTROL IS WHAT WE HAVE IN

09:33:54.133 --> 09:33:55.100
PLACE IN SOME CITIES IN OUR

09:33:55.167 --> 09:33:56.335
STATE THAT.

09:33:56.401 --> 09:33:59.538

IN THIS BILL IS HOW WE ADDRESS

09:34:04.309 --> 09:34:05.811
RENT GOUGING SO.

09:34:05.878 --> 09:34:08.413
IF YOU'RE AT CPI PLUS 7% YOU

09:34:08.480 --> 09:34:09.548
HAVE AN ABILITY TO MAKE A

09:34:09.615 --> 09:34:11.049
HEALTHY RETURN IF YOU ASK FOLKS

09:34:11.116 --> 09:34:13.218
FROM THE INDUSTRY -- BUT YOU'RE

09:34:13.285 --> 09:34:15.420
ALSO ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR PREVENT

09:34:15.487 --> 09:34:16.955
SOME OF THE MORE EXORBITANT RENT

09:34:17.022 --> 09:34:18.524
INCREASES AND PROVIDE SOME

09:34:18.590 --> 09:34:20.726
PREDICTABILITY TO TENANTS. TWO

09:34:20.793 --> 09:34:22.528
VERY DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THANK

YOU I APPRECIATE THAT.

09:34:24.096 --> 09:34:26.231
SO ON MY OWN TIME -- RENT

09:34:26.298 --> 09:34:28.000
CONTROL IS THE GOVERNMENT

09:34:28.066 --> 09:34:31.537
CONTROLLING AND REGULATING RENT.

09:34:31.603 --> 09:34:33.505
WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

09:34:33.572 --> 09:34:34.606
YOU CAN SAY IT'S NOT RENT

09:34:34.673 --> 09:34:36.508
CONTROL ALL DAY LONG BUT IT IS

09:34:36.575 --> 09:34:39.411
AND YOU KNOW IT IS.

09:34:39.478 --> 09:34:42.381
AND WHEN YOU PUT RENT CONTROL.

09:34:42.447 --> 09:34:43.849
IN THE PLACE THEN.

09:34:43.916 --> 09:34:47.085
YOU THIS IS A DISINCENTIVE FOR

09:34:47.152 --> 09:34:48.554
PEOPLE TO BUILD.

09:34:48.620 --> 09:34:51.290
AND WHAT WE NEED IS TO BELT.

09:34:51.356 --> 09:34:52.825
EVERYBODY IN HERE HAS BEEN

09:34:52.891 --> 09:34:54.560
TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS

09:34:54.626 --> 09:34:56.762
CRISIS OH MY GOD IT'S SO

09:34:56.829 --> 09:34:58.630
TERRIBLE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

09:34:58.697 --> 09:35:00.766
AND THEN WE COME UP WITH THIS.

09:35:00.833 --> 09:35:02.067
THIS DOES NOT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

09:35:02.134 --> 09:35:04.069
TO BILL.

09:35:04.136 --> 09:35:05.871
YOU'RE GOING TO DECREASE THE

09:35:05.938 --> 09:35:06.972
NUMBER OF UNITS AVAILABLE TO

09:35:07.039 --> 09:35:08.440
PEOPLE THAT IS THE EXACT

09:35:08.507 --> 09:35:11.577
OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED.

09:35:11.643 --> 09:35:13.378
THIS IS RENT CONTROL I DON'T

09:35:13.445 --> 09:35:15.948
CARE HOW YOU SAY IT I DON'T CARE

09:35:16.014 --> 09:35:17.416
HOW YOU SPEND IT THIS IS RENT

09:35:17.482 --> 09:35:19.117
CONTROL AND YOU KNOW AND YOU'RE

09:35:19.184 --> 09:35:19.685
GOING TO HARM.

09:35:19.751 --> 09:35:22.154

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I AM OF

09:35:34.266 --> 09:35:35.767
BEING REALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS

09:35:35.834 --> 09:35:37.703
BILL I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU AN

09:35:37.769 --> 09:35:40.839
EXAMPLE I RENT INVOLVED IN PARK

09:35:40.906 --> 09:35:42.908
I'VE BEEN IN MY PLACE. FOR NINE

09:35:42.975 --> 09:35:45.110
YEARS NOW MY RENTS STARTED AT

09:35:45.177 --> 09:35:45.744
FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH

09:35:45.811 --> 09:35:47.779
MY RENT NOW IS SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

09:35:47.846 --> 09:35:49.047
DOLLARS A MONTH I DID THE MATH

09:35:49.114 --> 09:35:50.849
AT JUST THE BASIC 5%.

09:35:50.916 --> 09:35:53.285
IF THAT RENT CONTROL OR THE 5%

09:35:53.352 --> 09:35:55.153
WAS IN PLACE -- MY A RATE WOULD

09:35:55.220 --> 09:35:56.788
BE AT ALMOST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

09:35:56.855 --> 09:35:57.456
DOLLARS A MONTH NOW.

09:35:57.522 --> 09:35:59.491
IF THE MY LANDLADY DECIDED TO

09:35:59.558 --> 09:36:01.693
INCREASE MY RENT 5% NOW THERE

09:36:01.760 --> 09:36:04.863
ARE SOME REPUTABLE -- LAND LORDS

09:36:04.930 --> 09:36:06.965
THAT ARE NOT GOING -- TO

09:36:07.032 --> 09:36:09.034
INCREASED RENT BUT I ASTOR.

09:36:09.101 --> 09:36:11.637
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE -- WAS

09:36:11.703 --> 09:36:14.006
NOW ABLE TO DO 5% AND SHE SAYS I

09:36:14.072 --> 09:36:15.340
WOULD HAVE TO RAISE IT 5%

09:36:15.407 --> 09:36:16.541
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT

09:36:16.608 --> 09:36:17.876
BEHIND BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I

09:36:17.943 --> 09:36:19.077
WON'T BE ABLE TO RAISE IT LATER.

09:36:19.144 --> 09:36:21.280
SO MY CONCERN FOR MY COMMUNITY

09:36:21.346 --> 09:36:23.649
IS THAT YES RIGHT NOW YOU'RE

09:36:23.715 --> 09:36:26.251
CAPPING AT A 5% FOR THOSE.

09:36:26.318 --> 09:36:29.588
ARE A REPUTABLE -- AND MAINLY

09:36:29.655 --> 09:36:31.023
THE HOUSE PRICE GOUGING IS

09:36:31.089 --> 09:36:33.191
REALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO LA SAN

09:36:33.258 --> 09:36:34.760
JOSE THE REALLY HIGH PRICE AREAS

09:36:34.826 --> 09:36:35.861
IN MY COMMUNITIES.

09:36:35.928 --> 09:36:40.198
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY I'M SURE

09:36:40.265 --> 09:36:41.300
THERE'S SOME BITE IF.

09:36:41.366 --> 09:36:41.967
THEY HAVE A LICENSE NOW TO RAISE

09:36:42.034 --> 09:36:43.769
THE RENT 5% THEY WILL BECAUSE

09:36:43.835 --> 09:36:44.336
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT

09:36:44.403 --> 09:36:46.505
BEHIND AND SO MY CONCERN IS THAT

09:36:46.572 --> 09:36:47.839
SOME OF MY FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE

09:36:47.906 --> 09:36:49.107
PRICED OUT.

09:36:49.174 --> 09:36:52.311
OF THEIR HOMES THERE RENTALS IN

09:36:52.377 --> 09:36:53.912
THREE TO FIVE YEARS WHICH REALLY

09:36:53.979 --> 09:36:55.280
IS GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT

09:36:55.347 --> 09:36:56.548
OF FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE

09:36:56.615 --> 09:36:58.417
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I THINK

09:36:58.483 --> 09:36:59.918
THAT WE ARE.

09:36:59.985 --> 09:37:02.120
REALLY DOING A DISSERVICE TO

09:37:02.187 --> 09:37:03.255

09:37:08.727 --> 09:37:10.162
BUT IN MY COMMUNITY.

09:37:10.228 --> 09:37:11.697

BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IN FIVE

09:37:20.739 --> 09:37:22.574

STATE -- I KNOW THERE WAS A

09:39:32.938 --> 09:39:34.873
SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW WE

09:39:39.177 --> 09:39:40.345
THAT WE DID NOT TALK ABOUT

09:39:40.412 --> 09:39:41.113
BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY EMBEDDED

09:39:41.179 --> 09:39:41.713
IN THE BILL.
