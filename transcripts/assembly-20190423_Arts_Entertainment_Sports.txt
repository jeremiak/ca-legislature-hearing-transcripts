OKAY TILL WILL LET'S MOVE ON TO THREE SEVENTY NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AT AB THREE SEVENTY NINE ADDRESSES AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS OUR YOUNG ATHLETES SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST. THAT HAS EMERGED AS A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE STUDIES SHOW THAT ONE IN THREE HUNDRED YOU'D HAVE AN UNDETECTED HEART CONDITION WHICH CAN RESULT IN A POTENTIALLY FATAL OF THAT. HI HOW ARE YOU THIS -- 72% OF THOSE WHO SUFFERED AN EPISODE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS AS LIFE THREATENING COACHES PARENTS AND REFEREES ARE OFTEN UNPREPARED WHEN. SCA STRIKES 92% OF VICTIMS WILL DIE IF NOT TREATED WITHIN MINUTES CURRENT CONCUSSION PROTOCOL REQUIRES A YOUTH ATHLETE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ACTIVITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY -- AND SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO RETURN UNTIL THE ATHLETE IS EVALUATED BY A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AB THREE SEVENTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE THE SAME PROTOCOLS USE FOR CONCUSSIONS. I TO BE USED WHEN SCA OCCURS WITH ME TODAY. I HAVE AT AS SEVERAL PEOPLE MAUREEN WAG THE CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THEIR PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION IN ERIC'S PARENTS. WHO HAVE WORKED ON THIS -- IN SEEN DIEGO FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- AND HAVE DONE REALLY PHENOMENAL WORK IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN OUT THERE. TO SEE ONE WE'VE TESTED. AT SCHOOLS IT'S REALLY A REMARKABLE I GET THE THEY KNOW THE EXACT SUGGEST EXPERT HOW MANY WIVES WE'VE ALREADY SAVE A HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL SOME REALLY PLEASE YOU GUYS ARE HERE TODAY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS TIME. AND COURSE ASSEMBLYMAN -- MAIENSCHEIN FOR SUPPORTING US MY NAME IS HECTOR PRESS NINE BREAK WILL BE HEARD TODAY. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW IS A LIFE OR DEATH ISSUE. IN JUST A FEW WEEKS ON MAY THIRD OUR SON ERIC WOULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. WE LOST HIM WHEN HE WAS JUST FIFTEEN YEARS OLD TO AN UNDETECTED HEART CONDITION THAT STUDIES SHOW. THAT ONE IN THREE HUNDRED YOUTH AT RISK FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST. IN HIS MEMORY AND TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES FROM THE TRAGEDY OF LOSING A CHILD THE SYNDROME THAT COULD BE PREVENTED. WE FOUNDED THE AEROPRESS SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION. ACROSS THE TEN YEARS SINCE WE'VE LOST HIM. OUR FOUNDATION HAS TOUCHED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH PARENTS. EDUCATORS SCHOOL NURSES COACHES ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND COUNSELORS WHO WORK WITH YOUTH BY ADVANCING SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST PREVENTION. TO HELP PROTECT YOUNG HEARTS. TWO YEARS AGO NEW PREVENTION PROTOCOL WAS INTRODUCED TO SCHOOL COMMUNITIES THROUGH AB ONE SIX THREE NINE ALSO KNOWN AS THE AEROPRESS SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST PREVENTION ACT. THE NEW PROTOCOL MIRRORED PRACTICES ALREADY IN PLACE TO MITIGATE DAMAGE CAUSED TO STUDENT ATHLETES FROM CONCUSSIONS. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT ADDITION TO SCHOOL SPORTS PROGRAMS BECAUSE IN FACT SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST IS THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF STUDENT ATHLETES. FOLLOWING THE SAME. PATHWAY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AB TWO ZERO ZERO SEVEN EXTENDED CONCUSSION PROTOCOLS TO APPLY TO COMMUNITY SPORTS PROGRAMS. AND NOW THE SAME REASONING WE ARE ASKING TO EXTEND SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST PREVENTION PROTOCOL. TO COMMUNITY SPORTS PROGRAMS TO AB. THREE SEVENTY NINE FOR PERSPECTIVE CONSIDER THESE STATISTICS. THERE ARE SIX POINT TWO MILLION SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA A SINGLE STUDY. OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY YOUTH AGES SIX TO SEVENTEEN FOUND THAT EIGHTY TO PROTECT 82%. PARTICIPATE IN A SPORTING ACTIVITY ONE THIRD OF THOSE ACTED ACTIVITIES HAPPEN TO ORGANIZE NON SCHOOL PROGRAMS. EXTRAPOLATED ACROSS THE STATE THAT EQUATES TO MILLIONS OF ACTIVE KIDS PARTICIPATING IN COMMUNITY SPORTS PROGRAM. WHICH MEANS THAT MILLIONS OF KIDS ARE NOT BENEFITING FROM THE PREVENTION OF PROTOCOL NOW IN PLACE IN SCHOOL SETTINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT A. B.. THREE SEVENTY NINE YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INSURANCE. THANKS WITNESSES. A GOOD MORNING -- HI MY NAME IS WHEN A PREDICATE PER AT ITS GRAYSON THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN. INTO THIS COMMITTEE FOR GIVING US A VOICE HERE TODAY. WHILE MANY ARE NOT AWARE OF THE REALITIES OF SUDDEN CARDIAC CARESSING USE. OUR COMMUNITY YES. AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE. THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION REPORTED LAST YEAR THAT APT TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND YOUTH ARE STRICKEN ANNUALLY. THE RECENTLY RELEASED MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARCHIVES IN SAN DIEGO REVEALED THAT OUR COUNTY ALONE HAS LOST AT LEAST TWELVE YOUNG PEOPLE EACH YEAR. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST IS THAT HE CAN BE PREVENTED. IF WE ARE PREPARED. PREPARE TO RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL WARNING SIGNS PREPARE TO RESPOND TO A KARTIK EMERGENCY BY PROVIDING IMMEDIATE ON SITE INTERVENTION. 72% OF YOUTH WHO EXPERIENCED SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST HAD AT LEAST ONE SYMPTOM PRIOR TO THE EVENT. THEY JUST DID NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS BEING LIFE THREATENING. THAT MEANS KIDS WILL FAINT WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE SIGN OF A POTENTIAL HEART CONDITION OR KIDS WHO EXHIBIT OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT APPEAR TO BE. CARDIOVASCULAR RELATED NEED TO BE PULLED FROM PLAY IN SEEN BY A DOCTOR. NO DIFFERENT THAN THE EXISTING CONCUSSION PROTOCOLS. A SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST VICTIMS MUST RECEIVE HANDS ONLY CPR IN AN EIGHTY D. SHOCK WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF COLLAPSE. BUT SINCE THE AVERAGE EMS ARRIVAL TIME IS EIGHT TO TWELVE MINUTES PEOPLE ON SITE MUST BE PREPARED TO INITIATE THIS LIFESAVING PROTOCOL. THIS IS WHY BYSTANDER INTERVENTION IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CAN TRIPLE THE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. AB THREE SEVENTY NINE INTRODUCES THIS EDUCATION AND BEST PRACTICE INITIATED BY THE ERROR PER THE SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST PREVENTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN INTO OUR COMMUNITY SPORTS PROGRAMS. WE ARE TRULY GRATEFUL FOR THE RECOGNITION OUR CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO IN ENACTING SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST PREVENTION LEGISLATION. BUT WE STILL HAVE SO FAR TO GO IN THIS IS THE NEXT STEP. IN THE NAME OF OUR BEAUTIFUL SON ERIC IN ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WE CAN'T NEEDLESSLY LOST WE URGE YOU TO PLEASE ADVANCE ASSEMBLY BILL.
