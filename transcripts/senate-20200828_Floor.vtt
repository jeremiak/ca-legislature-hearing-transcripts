CREATION OF THE POLICE AUDITOR.

AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE REASONABLE

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:52.091
PEOPLE I THINK ON BOTH SIDES OF

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:54.560
THE ISSUE AND I ENDED UP

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:55.794
SUPPORTING THE CREATION THE

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.429
POLICE AUDITOR. IN THE CITY OF

00:14:57.496 --> 00:15:01.700
FRESNO. OVER THE YEARS I WAS

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:05.170
DISAPPOINTED. TO FIND OUT HI

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.640
HOW IT PERFORMS. AND REALIZE

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:11.110
THAT. REALLY IT'S GOING TO BE

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.678
THE COMMUNITY AND THE LEADERS

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.114
IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT DECIDE

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.949
WHETHER AN OVERSIGHT ENTITY

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.151
IT'S NECESSARY WHAT I DON'T

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:19.752
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:23.822
LEGISLATION AB ELEVEN EIGHTY

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:25.524
FIVE. IS WHAT EXACTLY IT DOES I

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.493
THINK WE HEARD FROM THE SPEAKER

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:29.261
THAT THERE'S AMBIGUITY OR

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.897
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. THE ROLE

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.599
BETTER SUPPORT OF SUPERVISORS

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:36.368
HAS WITH THE SHERIFF SO ON AND

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.604
SO FORTH. THAT'S NOT BEEN MY

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.539
EXPERIENCE AT THE SUPERMAJORITY

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.709
ALONG. THAT IF A COUNTY BOARD

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.944
OF SUPERVISORS WANTS TO CREATE

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.780
OVERSIGHT BOARD THAT'S THEIR

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:52.751
DISCRETION. IF COMMUNITY ASKS

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.386
FOR IT ARE THEY BUY OTHER ME OF

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.287
PUTTING IT FORWARD EITHER

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:56.555
THROUGH BALLOT FOR THROUGH THE

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.357
NORMAL OF A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.392
LOCAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SO I

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.660
GUESS MY QUESTION IN ALL THIS

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:04.596
IS. WHY ARE WE CREATING THIS IF

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:07.266
THE POWERS ALREADY EXIST AND I

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.435
BELIEVE THEY DO. THEN WE ARE

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.670
BASICALLY PUTTING OUT WINDOW

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.005
DRESSING WITHOUT ANY REAL

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:14.840
SUBSTANCE. AND I THINK THAT

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:17.242
ULTIMATELY IS BAD POLICY

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.043
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BEING

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.180
DONE. DURING A HEATED INTENSE

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:23.182
POLITICAL CLIMATE WHERE WE HAVE

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.917
TO BE SHOWN IS DOING SOMETHING.

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:26.985
BUT I WOULD DEFER TO LOCAL

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.620
INDIVIDUALS THE LOCAL LEADERS

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.689
LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.457
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:33.826
WANT. THEY CAN ISSUED IT ON ITS

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:34.593
OWN THEY DON'T NEED OUR

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.729
ENCOURAGEMENT. OR OUR TACIT

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:39.798
APPROVAL TO DO SO ULTIMATELY I

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.501
THINK THIS IS. NOT GOING TO BE

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:45.037
ANYTHING NEW AND THE LOCAL

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:48.774
AUTHORITY ALREADY EXISTS SO

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.743
THAT'S MY CONCERN ON THIS ISSUE.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.411

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:42.686
HAVE BEEN MANY. WHAT IS KEPT ME

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.288
MOTIVATED AND STEADFAST IS THE

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:46.023
FACT THAT THIS BILL IS ALL

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:47.524
ABOUT PROTECTING KIDS AND

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.426
PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. THE

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:50.961
TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS A TARGET

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:53.830
AUDIENCE OVER 90% OF SMOKERS

EIGHTEEN. AND THE AVERAGE AGE

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.037
OF A NEW SMOKER COLLEAGUES IS

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:01.972
THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE. THERE IS

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.340
A MOM A MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:04.841
DEMONSTRATING FLAVORED TOBACCO

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:07.010
PRODUCTS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:09.813
INITIATING USE OF NICOTINE USE.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.048
WHAT STANDS OUT THE MOST TO ME

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:13.717
IS THE FACT THAT 80% OF YOUTH

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.552
WHO USE TOBACCO IN ANY FORM.

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:18.155
SAY THEY STARTED WITH A

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.389
FLAVORED PRODUCT. APPLE IS THE

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:21.425
DEADLIEST PRODUCT ON EARTH AND

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.993
WE ALLOW THIS INDUSTRY TO HOOK

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.796

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:27.030
BIG TOBACCO HAS LAUNCHED A

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:29.032
MULTI MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:31.335

MOVING THIS ISSUE FORWARD. THIS

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:59.736
ISSUE STARTED OUT AS A FLAVORED

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:02.372
VAPE BAND WHICH IS NOT A SINGLE

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:04.007
MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.676
WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THAT BUT IT

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.945
HAS MORPHED INTO SOMETHING ELSE

00:54:09.012 --> 00:54:11.581
OTHER THAN THAT. AND I COMMEND

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:12.649
THE AUTHOR AND WHAT WE'RE

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:13.783
TRYING TO DO IS NOT A SINGLE

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.952
PERSON IN HERE WHO WANTS KIDS

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:18.655
TO SMOKE. ANY TYPE OF PRODUCT

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:20.123
BUT THE TRUTH AND THE REALITY

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.158
IS THERE'S NOT A SINGLE KID ON

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:23.860
ANY HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS WHAT A

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:25.562
PACK OF CIGARETTES IN THEIR-

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.564
POCKET TODAY. THEY ALL HAVE

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:29.733
SOPHISTICATED BAKER HANDS AND

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:30.700
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:33.637
ABOUT. AND SO MY ONLY CONCERN

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:36.606
HERE IS THAT. IT IMPLIES THAT

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.942
IF YOU SMOKE MENTHOL YOU'RE NOT

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:41.144
SMART ENOUGH TO MAKE A HOPE

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:43.380
DECISION ON YOUR OWN. BUT IF

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:45.248
YOU SMOKE A CIGAR IF YOU SMOKE

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:47.150
A HOOKAH YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH TO

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:49.119
MAKE THAT DECISION. AND I THINK

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:50.520
THAT'S INSULTING IN AND OF

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:52.856
ITSELF WE SHOULD EITHER BAN ALL

00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:54.190
THE PRODUCTS BUT NOT

00:54:54.257 --> 00:54:55.792
SELECTIVELY PICK AND CHOOSE

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.460
WINNERS AND LOSERS WE SHOULD

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:59.763
INSULT INTELLIGENCE OF PEOPLE

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.364
WHO MIGHT CHOOSE TO SMOKE

00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:02.766
CIGARETTES I AM ADAMANTLY

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:06.503
OPPOSED TO SMOKING. MY FATHER

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:07.937
DIED IT'LL BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:10.373
IN NOVEMBER FROM LUNG CANCER.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.441
BUT HE MADE THE CONSCIOUS

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.910
DECISION ON HIS OWN FOURTEEN

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.979
YEARS BEFORE HE DIED THE STOP

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:17.814
SMOKING CIGARETTES BECAUSE HE

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.849
WAS SMART ENOUGH. TO UNDERSTAND

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:22.919
THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF. IF

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:25.221
YOU CONTINUE TO SMOKE. N.

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:27.357
THAT'S ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:29.759
HERE IS THAT WE TRUST BULLS

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.728
INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THOSE

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:34.998
CHOICES. HI ADAM OPPOSE SMOKING

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:37.434
JUST LIKE I AM OPPOSED TO

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.335
ABORTIONS BUT I STAND HERE

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.237
STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF A

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:43.239
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND I

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:45.341
STAND HERE STRONGLY ITH THE

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:47.510
INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO MAKE A

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.144
BETTER DECISION AS TO WHAT THEY

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:51.514
PUT IN THEIR BODY. BUT THIS

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:52.782
PERSONAL CONCERN. I STILL

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:55.418
SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BUT I WISH

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:58.154
CIGARETTES SHOULD BE. OUR HOPE

00:55:58.221 --> 00:55:59.322
IT SHOULD BE PLACED BACK IN

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.458
THIS- BAND AS WELL AS CIGARS

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:04.661

THAT THE INFORMATION IS

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:23.999

WASN'T A DISCRETIONARY EVENTS

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.814
MEANING THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:40.849
THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THEIR

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.217
DOLLARS IF THEY HAVE THE

DISCRETION TO PAY RENT OR NOT

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:46.054
HE RAN THAT WE ARE CREATING A

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.924
SEGMENT OF THE CREDIT CHANGE.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:51.293
THAT MAY ALLOW FOR ESSENTIALLY

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.761
SANCTION FRAUD AND THAT IS MY

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:56.265
CONCERN- WHICH IS AMONG OTHERS

LEARNED QUITE A BIT ABOUT THIS

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.783
I THINK IT IS FAIR THAT IN

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:32.553
AGREEMENT- BE REACHED BETWEEN

01:41:32.619 --> 01:41:34.855

THE RESTAURANT ESPECIALLY MOM

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:37.991
AND POP. TO KNOW THAT IF

THEM HAVE THEIR OWN DELIVERY

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:46.467
DRIVERS AND IT DOES CREATE A

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:49.703
BIT OF CONFUSION SOMETIMES AND

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:52.840
ALSO. THROUGH THE DISCUSSION

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:53.507

01:42:01.882 --> 01:42:04.751
DELIVERY PROCESS I DON'T MEAN

01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:05.319
THE DELIVERY CHARGE BUT THE

ACTUAL. THE COULD BE DIFFERENT

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:09.857

OPT OUT OF BEING LISTED ONLINE

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:20.767

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:41.501
PHRASE IN THE LEGISLATION IS

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:42.803
YOU CANNOT ARRANGE FOR THE

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:43.937

COULD POTENTIALLY DO THAT AND I

05:39:56.843 --> 05:39:58.010
KNOW THAT EDISON IS NOW

05:39:58.077 --> 05:40:01.180
ANSWERED IN MR- OR SENATOR-

05:40:01.247 --> 05:40:03.416
WIENER RAISED IT BUT I WANTED

TO- JUST TO CONVEY IT BECAUSE I

05:40:06.686 --> 05:40:08.521
THINK A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL

IT'S GOT MAY BE NECESSARY SO

05:40:10.790 --> 05:40:13.359

APPROPRIATE BUT I ALSO THINK IT

05:40:33.813 --> 05:40:35.047
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO EXTEND

05:40:35.114 --> 05:40:37.150

FUNDAMENTALLY ANXIOUS LAST YEAR

05:47:36.969 --> 05:47:39.972
TO UTILIZE THIS VERY MECHANISM

05:47:40.039 --> 05:47:41.373
TO IMPOSE ON RATEPAYERS

05:47:41.440 --> 05:47:43.375
SUPPOSED TO SHAREHOLDERS THE

05:47:43.442 --> 05:47:46.545
ABILITY TO TRYING TO LATE. THE

05:47:46.612 --> 05:47:49.181
VICTIMS A FIRE SET DEFAULT

05:47:49.248 --> 05:47:50.849
TRIANGULATED INSURANCE

05:47:50.916 --> 05:47:51.584
COMPANIES BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN

05:47:51.650 --> 05:47:55.988
NOW. IT DOESN'T WORK AND I HAVE

05:47:56.055 --> 05:47:56.589
SOME THEORIES ON THAT. THINK

05:47:56.655 --> 05:47:58.157
ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE. NOT

05:47:58.224 --> 05:47:59.692
ONLY FACING WHAT WHAT I JUST

05:47:59.758 --> 05:48:01.093
EXPRESSION WOULD CENTER ALLEN

05:48:01.160 --> 05:48:03.562
EXPRESSED BUT COMPARE THAT TO

05:48:03.629 --> 05:48:05.898
THE ESTIMATED FORTY BILLION

05:48:05.965 --> 05:48:08.067
DOLLAR HIT TO RATE PAYERS FOR

05:48:08.133 --> 05:48:09.969
COST OF THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE

05:48:10.035 --> 05:48:12.371
ALREADY OCCURRED. THREE BILLION

05:48:12.438 --> 05:48:13.305
DOLLARS IN THIS MEASURE IS A

05:48:13.372 --> 05:48:17.176
BARGAIN. IN TERMS OF PREPARING

05:48:17.243 --> 05:48:19.378
FOR MITIGATING THE PROBLEM. TOO

05:48:19.445 --> 05:48:20.679
OFTEN IN POLITICS WE SPEND THE

05:48:20.746 --> 05:48:23.082
TIME RACING UP TO SOLVE THE

05:48:23.148 --> 05:48:24.617
PROBLEM AFTER THE AIRPLANE IS

05:48:24.683 --> 05:48:26.418
AT THE BUILDING. THIS MEASURES

05:48:26.485 --> 05:48:28.287
ABOUT DOING MITIGATING MEASURES

05:48:28.354 --> 05:48:29.955
TO AVOID THAT BEFORE IT EVER

05:48:30.022 --> 05:48:32.258
HAPPENS. THE EXACT SAME FUNDING

05:48:32.324 --> 05:48:34.526
MECHANISM COUPLE OF OTHER

05:48:34.593 --> 05:48:37.096
ARGUMENTS I WANT TO JUST

05:48:37.162 --> 05:48:37.730
ADDRESS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

05:48:37.796 --> 05:48:39.665
QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS

05:48:39.732 --> 05:48:42.401
ME AT LEAST SO. IS TO REMIND

05:48:42.468 --> 05:48:44.203
FOLKS THAT THIS SURCHARGE IN

05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:47.273
THIS MEASURE. EXTEND THE IS NOT

05:48:47.339 --> 05:48:48.540
APPLIED TO QUALIFYING LOW

05:48:48.607 --> 05:48:49.975
INCOME CUSTOMERS A CUSTOMER'S

05:48:50.042 --> 05:48:51.243
YORKSHIRE CITIES FOR MEDICAL

05:48:51.310 --> 05:48:54.046
NEEDS. BUT ARGUMENT IS OF THIS

05:48:54.113 --> 05:48:57.850
HURTS LOW INCOME FOLKS NOT TRUE.

05:48:57.916 --> 05:48:59.485
SAME MECHANISM THAT THE SENATOR

05:48:59.551 --> 05:49:01.120
DODD AND OTHERS HAD WORKED ON

05:49:01.186 --> 05:49:04.456
LAST YEAR IN TEN FIFTY FOUR

05:49:04.523 --> 05:49:06.592
EXACTLY APPLIED HERE EXACTLY

05:49:06.659 --> 05:49:08.360
APPLIED HERE. THE OTHER ISSUE

05:49:08.427 --> 05:49:14.300
IS. THIS LARGER DYNAMIC ABOUT.

05:49:14.366 --> 05:49:15.768
THE IMPACT ON RATEPAYERS AND

05:49:15.834 --> 05:49:19.338
WHETHER OR NOT. THIS IS FAIR

05:49:19.405 --> 05:49:20.839
WELL THIS BILL SAYS AND TO

05:49:20.906 --> 05:49:22.775
AVOID ANY ISSUE I WANT TO QUOTE

05:49:22.841 --> 05:49:27.279
PAGE NINE. LINES TWENTY NINE OR

05:49:27.346 --> 05:49:27.846
TWENTY EIGHT THROUGH THIRTY

05:49:27.913 --> 05:49:29.982
WHERE IT SAYS. THE MONEY SHOULD

05:49:30.049 --> 05:49:31.383
BE ALLOCATED PROPORTIONALLY

05:49:31.450 --> 05:49:33.652
WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA OF THE

05:49:33.719 --> 05:49:35.387
LARGE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS

05:49:35.454 --> 05:49:36.755
AND EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN THE

05:49:36.822 --> 05:49:38.457
SERVICE AREA WITHIN THESE

05:49:38.524 --> 05:49:40.859
AREAS. IT'S THAT'S ONE

05:49:40.926 --> 05:49:43.228
REFERENCES ANOTHER REFERENCE ON

05:49:43.295 --> 05:49:44.963
PAGE TWENTY LINE TWENTY NINE.

05:49:45.030 --> 05:49:47.666
THE POINT IS THAT IF THIS IS

05:49:47.733 --> 05:49:50.102
RATEPAYER MONEY. THE RATEPAYER

05:49:50.169 --> 05:49:53.238
MONEY IS TO BE UTILIZED ONLY IN

05:49:53.305 --> 05:49:55.007
RATE SO SAN DIEGO AT SAN

05:49:55.074 --> 05:49:57.309
DIEGO'S MONEY P. JEANNIE IT'S

05:49:57.376 --> 05:49:59.411
MONEY AND EDISON IT'S MONEY TO

05:49:59.478 --> 05:50:00.479
BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THESE

05:50:00.546 --> 05:50:02.581
CHALLENGES WITH THESE FIRES ARE

05:50:02.648 --> 05:50:05.684
SO. AND CLIMATECHANGE AND THE

05:50:05.751 --> 05:50:07.753
NUMBER OF LIGHTNING STRIKES IN

05:50:07.820 --> 05:50:08.921
THE IMPACT YOU KNOW SOMEONE

05:50:08.987 --> 05:50:10.689
ARGUES WELL THESE WERE CAUSED

05:50:10.756 --> 05:50:12.591
BY LIGHTNING STRIKES WELL LET'S

05:50:12.658 --> 05:50:13.659
ASSUME THAT. THE LIGHTNING

05:50:13.726 --> 05:50:15.194
STRIKES THEN CAUSED A SPARK IN

05:50:15.260 --> 05:50:16.962
THE TRANSFORMER AND YOU CAN'T

05:50:17.029 --> 05:50:18.597
MAKE A DETERMINATION. WE'RE

05:50:18.664 --> 05:50:21.500
TRYING TO MARY WHAT WE DID LAST

05:50:21.567 --> 05:50:23.502
YEAR TEN FIFTY FOUR. WITH A

05:50:23.569 --> 05:50:26.572
VERY ELEGANT APPROACH IN TERMS

05:50:26.638 --> 05:50:27.906
OF WHAT CENTER ISLAND SENATORS

05:50:27.973 --> 05:50:30.142
STARTED. SEVERAL MULLIN

05:50:30.209 --> 05:50:32.578
ASSEMBLY MEMBER C.

05:50:32.644 --> 05:50:33.579
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. EVERYBODY

05:50:33.645 --> 05:50:36.582
SPENT WELL OVER TWO YEARS

05:50:36.648 --> 05:50:37.850
NEGOTIATING OF COURSE ARE. THE

05:50:37.916 --> 05:50:41.387
STEAM. ORTHODOX MEMBER OVER

05:50:41.453 --> 05:50:43.322
THERE SENATOR STERN BEGAN WHO

05:50:43.389 --> 05:50:45.758
WORK SO HARD ON THIS TO TRY TO

05:50:45.824 --> 05:50:47.626
MARRY THESE TWO CONCEPTS AT A

05:50:47.693 --> 05:50:49.962
TIME WHEN WE'RE FACING SUCH A

05:50:50.028 --> 05:50:51.997
CRISIS WHERE WE HAVE SPENT

05:50:52.064 --> 05:50:53.699
YEARS WORKING LITERALLY ON THE

05:50:53.766 --> 05:50:55.334
FRAMEWORK OF THE FINANCIAL

05:50:55.401 --> 05:50:58.036
PIECE AND YEARS WORKING ON AND

05:50:58.103 --> 05:51:00.339
PULLING OUT OF THE THOSE BOND

05:51:00.406 --> 05:51:01.607
MEASURES THAT WE'RE GONNA GO ON

05:51:01.673 --> 05:51:02.441
THE BALLOT OR SOME DISCUSSION

05:51:02.508 --> 05:51:04.743
IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT BONDS BUT

05:51:04.810 --> 05:51:06.245
THIS ISN'T BONDS THIS IS RARE

05:51:06.311 --> 05:51:08.414
MONEY. REDUCING THEIR RISK

05:51:08.480 --> 05:51:12.418
PROFILE IN THIS REGARD. AND THE

05:51:12.484 --> 05:51:14.653
ARGUMENT THAT I'VE HEARD FROM.

05:51:14.720 --> 05:51:17.456
I GET IT I SAW. US ONE OF THE

05:51:17.523 --> 05:51:19.625
SENATORS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

05:51:19.691 --> 05:51:20.159
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT AND

05:51:20.225 --> 05:51:22.060
REPAIRS HE'S RIGHT. LARGE

05:51:22.127 --> 05:51:24.196
REPAIRS THEY PAY MOE. WE HAVE

05:51:24.263 --> 05:51:25.798
OBSERVED JURISPRUDENTIAL MATTER

05:51:25.864 --> 05:51:27.232
MAY DETERMINATION THAT POOR

05:51:27.299 --> 05:51:30.002
PEOPLE PAY LESS. RESIDENTIAL'S

05:51:30.068 --> 05:51:31.503
PAY SOME PORTION AND

05:51:31.570 --> 05:51:34.606
COMMERCIALS PAY MORE THAT HAS

05:51:34.673 --> 05:51:35.207
BEEN SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY

05:51:35.274 --> 05:51:35.874
HAS DIED IN THIS GOVERNMENT HAS

05:51:35.941 --> 05:51:37.609
DONE FOR MANY YEARS NO QUESTION

05:51:37.676 --> 05:51:40.779
ABOUT IT. BUT RIGHT NOW AS WE

05:51:40.846 --> 05:51:42.347
STAND HERE TODAY THERE'S NO

05:51:42.414 --> 05:51:43.982
INCREASE IN FEES IT'S EXACTLY

05:51:44.049 --> 05:51:46.585
THE SAME FEE. THAT B. IS BEEN

05:51:46.652 --> 05:51:48.153
EXTENDED UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR

05:51:48.220 --> 05:51:49.888
THAT CENTER DODD INCIDENT OF A

05:51:49.955 --> 05:51:51.890
SUMMER HOLDEN OTHERS NEGOTIATED

05:51:51.957 --> 05:51:53.792
UP UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY FIVE.

05:51:53.859 --> 05:51:55.561
AND THIS JUST SIMPLY EXTENDS

05:51:55.627 --> 05:51:57.629
THIS TIME FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO

05:51:57.696 --> 05:51:58.564
GET A REVENUE STREAM AND

05:51:58.630 --> 05:52:00.265
SENATOR STERN WAS JUST TALKING

05:52:00.332 --> 05:52:01.066
IS IT RELATED TO THE LAST

05:52:01.133 --> 05:52:02.634
MEASURE ABOUT HOW CHEAP MONEY

05:52:02.701 --> 05:52:04.169
AS EVERYBODY WE TALKED TO ALL

05:52:04.236 --> 05:52:06.138
THE EXPERTS SAY. NOW IS THE

05:52:06.205 --> 05:52:08.440
TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS I

05:52:08.507 --> 05:52:09.408
CLOSER TO PARTICULARLY

05:52:09.475 --> 05:52:12.177
IMPORTANT ELEMENTS MONEY IS THE

05:52:12.244 --> 05:52:13.846
CHEAPEST IT CAN BE. FOURTEEN

05:52:13.912 --> 05:52:15.013
BASIS POINTS ON A TWO YEAR

05:52:15.080 --> 05:52:16.482
TREASURY THAT'S LITERALLY JUST

05:52:16.548 --> 05:52:17.349
A LITTLE MORE THAN A TENTH OF A

05:52:17.416 --> 05:52:21.253
PERCENT. THE COST OF MONEY IS

05:52:21.320 --> 05:52:22.421
THE LAST. AND TO. WHEN WE

05:52:22.488 --> 05:52:24.590
SPACED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF

05:52:24.656 --> 05:52:25.958
RISK FROM THE LAST SET OF FIRES

05:52:26.024 --> 05:52:28.060
WHAT WE SEE NOW IS THE BIGGEST

05:52:28.126 --> 05:52:29.027
I THINK SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT

05:52:29.094 --> 05:52:31.296
AS THE BIGGEST. NOW IN STATE'S

05:52:31.363 --> 05:52:33.765
HISTORY IF NOT PRETTY CLOSE. N.

05:52:33.832 --> 05:52:36.068
SHOULDN'T WE INTELLIGENTLY

05:52:36.134 --> 05:52:37.803
THINK THROUGH AND PLAN IN

05:52:37.870 --> 05:52:39.271
ADVANCE SHOULD WE LIMIT WHAT

05:52:39.338 --> 05:52:41.440
THAT RISK IS TO HELP EVERYBODY

05:52:41.507 --> 05:52:43.175
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS ONLY

05:52:43.242 --> 05:52:45.377
DOES IT FOR THE SERVICE AREAS.

05:52:45.444 --> 05:52:46.311
BUT IT IS INDEED A THOUGHTFUL

05:52:46.378 --> 05:52:48.380
APPROACH. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING

05:52:48.447 --> 05:52:50.015
THAT IS LAST MINUTE BY ITS

05:52:50.082 --> 05:52:51.550
NATURE BUT IS JUST COBBLING

05:52:51.617 --> 05:52:53.852
TOGETHER. WELL DEVELOPED

05:52:53.919 --> 05:52:57.523
COMPONENT PARTS. THAT INFORMED

05:52:57.589 --> 05:52:58.790
ONE OF THE BIGGEST EMERGENCIES

05:52:58.857 --> 05:53:00.659
WE'VE EVER FACED IN CALIFORNIA

05:53:00.726 --> 05:53:02.327
ON TOP OF THE OTHER BIGGEST

05:53:02.394 --> 05:53:03.896
EMERGENCIES WE'VE EVER FACED IN

05:53:03.962 --> 05:53:05.964
CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT I WANT

TO THE COMMITTEE WHILE WE

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

05:54:18.837 --> 05:54:21.106
LINES START FIRES.

05:54:21.173 --> 05:54:23.275
UNFORTUNATELY THE UTILITIES

05:54:23.342 --> 05:54:25.711
JURISDICTION OVER CLEARING OF

05:54:25.777 --> 05:54:28.880
THE BRUSH OF DEBRIS AND TREES

IS LIMITED TO FIFTEEN FEET A

05:54:31.783 --> 05:54:33.552
MERE FIFTEEN FEET AROUND THOSE

05:54:33.619 --> 05:54:35.687
POWER LINES WHEN THE VAST

05:54:35.754 --> 05:54:37.889
MAJORITY OF THE FUEL IN THE

LIABILITY THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY

05:54:48.634 --> 05:54:52.070
EVENTUALLY WE HAVE SUCH A HUGE.

05:54:52.137 --> 05:54:55.607
GROWTH BECAUSE OF DEAD TREES

05:54:55.674 --> 05:54:58.310
DUE TO DROUGHT IN BEATLES. WE

FEET AROUND. A TREE. AND THAT'S

06:23:06.763 --> 06:23:08.965
THEIR LEVEL OF-AUTHORITY

OPINION WE HAVE FIFTEEN YEARS

OF NOT EVEN MAKING THE NEXT

RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT ONLY-

06:26:17.621 --> 06:26:18.421
IT'S AND IT'S ONLY A SELECT

06:26:18.488 --> 06:26:19.890
GROUP OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT WE I

06:26:19.956 --> 06:26:24.327
WAS INVOLVED IN. A AB EIGHT

06:26:24.394 --> 06:26:24.928
FIFTY NINE WHICH WAS A BIOMASS

06:26:24.995 --> 06:26:28.565
BILL. HAS A FIRE- NINE OH ONE A

06:26:28.632 --> 06:26:29.900
FEW YEARS AGO WE ALL WORK

06:26:29.966 --> 06:26:31.535
TOGETHER ON IN TEN FIFTY FOUR

06:26:31.601 --> 06:26:33.069
AND I. HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION

06:26:33.136 --> 06:26:35.238
FOR- TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR

06:26:35.305 --> 06:26:37.607
WATERSHEDS IN OUR OUR WILDLIFE

06:26:37.674 --> 06:26:40.410
AND SEE THESE CATASTROPHIC

06:26:40.477 --> 06:26:42.512
FIRES BURNED. AND BUDGET TO

06:26:42.579 --> 06:26:44.548
NARROW THIS BILL DOWN TO THREE

06:26:44.614 --> 06:26:46.016
UTILITIES THREE I USE WHERE'S

06:26:46.082 --> 06:26:47.284
THE- WHERE'S THE PUBLIC

06:26:47.350 --> 06:26:48.818
UTILITIES WHERE'S THE- WHERE'S

06:26:48.885 --> 06:26:50.086
THE NEW NEEDS AND ALL THE OTHER

06:26:50.153 --> 06:26:51.755
ONES THAT. ARE GETTING A

06:26:51.821 --> 06:26:54.424
BENEFIT FROM. THE RESOURCES

06:26:54.491 --> 06:26:56.359
BEING MANAGED AS WELL AND SO

06:26:56.426 --> 06:26:57.327
IT'S REALLY JUST NARROW IT DOWN

06:26:57.394 --> 06:26:59.296
TO. THE THREE ITEMS SO THAT I

06:26:59.362 --> 06:27:01.531
THINK THAT'S- VERY DIFFICULT I

06:27:01.598 --> 06:27:03.066
LOOK AT THE BILL THERE'S A

06:27:03.133 --> 06:27:04.568
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR.

06:27:04.634 --> 06:27:06.570
THE FRYING CAN NOW. I DON'T

06:27:06.636 --> 06:27:08.104
KNOW IF THAT'S JUST SUPPORT OR

06:27:08.171 --> 06:27:09.973
OR THAT'S THE NAME ABILITY BILL

06:27:10.040 --> 06:27:11.675
TO GET A BOAT SOMEWHERE. BUT

06:27:11.741 --> 06:27:12.776
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THIS

06:27:12.842 --> 06:27:14.177
BILL THAT DOESN'T REALLY ADD UP

06:27:14.244 --> 06:27:17.147
TO WILDFIRE SO THOSE ARE A

06:27:17.213 --> 06:27:17.881
COUPLE OF FIRST. QUESTIONS THAT

06:27:17.948 --> 06:27:19.215
I HAVE. THAT I YOU KNOW THIS IS

06:27:19.282 --> 06:27:21.785
A I THINK IT. THE BILL THAT

06:27:21.851 --> 06:27:23.420
REALLY NEEDS A LOT MORE TIME

06:27:23.486 --> 06:27:23.987
THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

06:27:24.054 --> 06:27:26.656
PAST. AS IN THIS SESSION AND I

06:27:26.723 --> 06:27:28.258
KNOW THAT- WE HAVE FIRES

06:27:28.325 --> 06:27:29.926
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE WERE

06:27:29.993 --> 06:27:30.727
WERE BURNING DOWN IS

06:27:30.794 --> 06:27:32.562
UNPRECEDENTED. BUT IS THIS

06:27:32.629 --> 06:27:34.631
REALLY THE ROUTE WE WANT TO GO

06:27:34.698 --> 06:27:36.700
IT'S REALLY THAT. THE YOU KNOW

06:27:36.766 --> 06:27:38.702
THE FOLKS OF CALIFORNIA

06:27:38.768 --> 06:27:41.071
EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA'S IS.

06:27:41.137 --> 06:27:43.506
LIABLE FOR. THE ENVIRONMENT

06:27:43.573 --> 06:27:45.542
THAT IS INCIDENTS SUCH DISARRAY

06:27:45.609 --> 06:27:47.310
FOR LACK OF MANAGEMENT FOR.

06:27:47.377 --> 06:27:50.280
OVER THE LAST. SIXTY YEARS O

06:27:50.347 --> 06:27:51.615
FOR ME IT'S LIKE WE'RE PICKING

06:27:51.681 --> 06:27:53.016
OUT ONE SECTOR THAT'S REALLY

06:27:53.083 --> 06:27:54.751
EASY TO- YOU KNOW YEAH THEY DO

06:27:54.818 --> 06:27:56.353
CAUSE SOME FIRES BUT ONLY ONE

06:27:56.419 --> 06:27:58.321
OUT OF TEN FIRES. ARE CAUSED BY

06:27:58.388 --> 06:28:00.357
UTILITIES WE KNOW THAT FOR A

06:28:00.423 --> 06:28:02.592
FACT SO. THOSE ARE A FEW OTHER

06:28:02.659 --> 06:28:05.362
QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO HAVE

06:28:05.428 --> 06:28:08.198
ADDRESSED IF YOU MAY. AS

06:28:08.264 --> 06:28:11.968
CENTERS YOU WANT FOR THAT JIM.

06:28:12.035 --> 06:28:13.670
BUT THE EASY EXAMPLES DOT WOULD

06:28:13.737 --> 06:28:17.207
BE THIS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE

06:28:17.273 --> 06:28:19.275
AUTHORS AND OTHER AUTHORS IN A

06:28:19.342 --> 06:28:19.876
LOT OF FOLKS TO SPEND A LOT OF

06:28:19.943 --> 06:28:22.746
TIME. ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR IS

06:28:22.812 --> 06:28:23.780
THAT BARRING MONEY HAS NEVER

06:28:23.847 --> 06:28:26.416
BEEN CHEAPER. SO LET'S ASSUME

06:28:26.483 --> 06:28:30.020
YOU COULD ESTABLISH A LOAN FOR

06:28:30.086 --> 06:28:32.722
YOUR HOME. AND INSTEAD OF

06:28:32.789 --> 06:28:34.257
PAYING 5% INTEREST YOU COULD

06:28:34.324 --> 06:28:37.093
PAY A HALF A PERCENT INTEREST

06:28:37.160 --> 06:28:39.195
BUT YOU PAID IT ALL AT THE END

06:28:39.262 --> 06:28:40.964
INSTEAD OF AT THE BEGINNING.

06:28:41.031 --> 06:28:42.565
THE TEST IS WHETHER IT'S A

06:28:42.632 --> 06:28:44.300
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND TO THE

06:28:44.367 --> 06:28:45.869
FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE

06:28:45.935 --> 06:28:49.072
TAXPAYERS. OF ANY KIND OF OTHER

06:28:49.139 --> 06:28:50.874
BORROWING THE TEST WHEN YOU

06:28:50.940 --> 06:28:52.776
LOOK AT THE ISSUE THAT YOU TALK

06:28:52.842 --> 06:28:55.211
ABOUT A PREDATORY LENDING. IS

06:28:55.278 --> 06:28:57.213
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE COST.

06:28:57.280 --> 06:28:59.315
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE COST AND

06:28:59.382 --> 06:29:00.784
THE REALITY IS FROM ALL THE

06:29:00.850 --> 06:29:02.619
BEST EXPERTS THAT WE CAN FIND

06:29:02.686 --> 06:29:03.453
FROM ALL THE VARIOUS

06:29:03.520 --> 06:29:04.988
INSTITUTIONS WITH WHOM WE HAVE

06:29:05.055 --> 06:29:06.623
CONSULTED. AND ALL OF THE

06:29:06.690 --> 06:29:08.425
VARIOUS FOLKS SENATOR A SENATOR

06:29:08.491 --> 06:29:11.227
BLOOM AND MULLIN OTHERS AS YOU

06:29:11.294 --> 06:29:12.729
KNOW IS THAT MONEY NEVER

06:29:12.796 --> 06:29:15.065
CHEAPER AS I SAID EARLIER. IT'S

06:29:15.131 --> 06:29:16.800
LITERALLY ALMOST A TENTH OF A

06:29:16.866 --> 06:29:18.401
PERCENT FOR TWO YEAR TREASURY.

06:29:18.468 --> 06:29:20.336
YOU CAN ESTABLISH THE PRICING

06:29:20.403 --> 06:29:23.173
NOW. WE HAVE THE NEED NOW IS

06:29:23.239 --> 06:29:24.774
THE STATE'S BURNING UP BECAUSE

06:29:24.841 --> 06:29:26.376
YOU HAVE THE NEED FOR YOUR

06:29:26.443 --> 06:29:28.144
HOUSE YOUR CAR FOR YOUR FAMILY.

06:29:28.211 --> 06:29:29.946
AND THIS IS JUST A PAYMENT

06:29:30.013 --> 06:29:31.581
STRUCTURE THAT QUITE FRANKLY.

06:29:31.648 --> 06:29:33.049
IS GOING TO BE A LOT CHEAPER

06:29:33.116 --> 06:29:34.784
THAN G. O. BONDS OR OTHER TYPES

06:29:34.851 --> 06:29:37.787
OF BONDS. THE BETTER I THE THAT

06:29:37.854 --> 06:29:39.622
WOULD BE ISSUE. SECOND THING

06:29:39.689 --> 06:29:41.558
IS. THAT WHEN YOU READ THE

06:29:41.624 --> 06:29:42.759
MEASURE ITS FIVE HUNDRED

06:29:42.826 --> 06:29:43.393
MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS

06:29:43.460 --> 06:29:44.828
BORROWED WHICH IS CONTINUOUS

06:29:44.894 --> 06:29:46.162
APPROPRIATIONS FOR WORK RIGHT

06:29:46.229 --> 06:29:47.797
NOW PUT PEOPLE TO WORK DEAL

06:29:47.864 --> 06:29:48.832
WITH SOME OF THIS VERY

06:29:48.898 --> 06:29:49.365
EXTRAORDINARY REYES FROM

06:29:49.432 --> 06:29:51.701
CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THEN THERE

06:29:51.768 --> 06:29:53.636
IS THE ISSUE OF APPROPRIATION

06:29:53.703 --> 06:29:55.138
FOR THE BALANCE OF THE MONEY.

06:29:55.205 --> 06:29:56.439
THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN

06:29:56.506 --> 06:29:57.807
OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUB THOSE

06:29:57.874 --> 06:29:59.809
ISSUES GOING FORWARD. AND THE

06:29:59.876 --> 06:30:01.444
THIRD THING I THINK THAT GOES

06:30:01.511 --> 06:30:02.112
TO THE CORE OF WHAT YOU'RE

06:30:02.178 --> 06:30:03.747
SAYING IS THE NEXUS ISSUE AND

06:30:03.813 --> 06:30:05.882
YOUR SENATE ALL YOUR 1000%

06:30:05.949 --> 06:30:07.517
CORRECT. YOU CANNOT USE

06:30:07.584 --> 06:30:09.319
RATEPAYER MONEY FOR NON. RATE

06:30:09.385 --> 06:30:11.287
PAIR INTERESTS. BUT THE

06:30:11.354 --> 06:30:12.722
ARGUMENT IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT

06:30:12.789 --> 06:30:14.190
WE SPEND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS

06:30:14.257 --> 06:30:16.092
JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS ON ALL

06:30:16.159 --> 06:30:16.726
THIS LIABILITY ANYTHING WE CAN

06:30:16.793 --> 06:30:19.562
DO. FOR THE REPAIRS TO REDUCE

06:30:19.629 --> 06:30:23.366
THAT LIABILITY WOULD BE A

06:30:23.433 --> 06:30:25.535
PRUDENT THING TO DO. CHECK A

06:30:25.602 --> 06:30:28.071
ARE CHEAP. IT'S NOT IT'S THE

06:30:28.138 --> 06:30:28.671
IT'S THE FARTHEST THING AWAY

06:30:28.738 --> 06:30:31.608
FROM. ANYTHING YOU LOOK AT. IN

06:30:31.674 --> 06:30:36.246
THE CONTEXT OF. A OF A- A

06:30:36.312 --> 06:30:36.846
PREDATORY IN THE LAST THING I

06:30:36.913 --> 06:30:39.082
WOULD SAY IS. WE ARE IN TOUGH

06:30:39.149 --> 06:30:42.218
TIMES. AND CREATIVE FINANCING

06:30:42.285 --> 06:30:43.920
ALLOWS US TO GET THE PEOPLE TO

06:30:43.987 --> 06:30:46.022
WORK GET THIS WORK DONE NOW

06:30:46.089 --> 06:30:47.090
WITHOUT PUTTING A BURDEN ON THE

06:30:47.157 --> 06:30:49.025
BUDGET WITHOUT PUTTING A BURDEN

06:30:49.092 --> 06:30:50.260
ON THE BUDGET AND ALSO BY THE

06:30:50.326 --> 06:30:54.230
WAY ZERO BURDEN ON RATEPAYERS.

06:30:54.297 --> 06:30:56.065
ARE GOING TO PAY A NICKEL A

06:30:56.132 --> 06:30:59.269
NICKEL UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY SIX

06:30:59.335 --> 06:30:59.869
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO PAY WHAT

06:30:59.936 --> 06:31:00.503
WAS UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR NOBODY

06:31:00.570 --> 06:31:03.173
HAS ONE. MORE MONEY AND ALSO

06:31:03.239 --> 06:31:04.340
JUST TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IF I

06:31:04.407 --> 06:31:06.476
COULD THAT TURN TALKED ABOUT

06:31:06.543 --> 06:31:09.679
AND- THE- THE A. R. P. POOR

06:31:09.746 --> 06:31:11.781
PEOPLE UNDER THE CARE. OF THE

06:31:11.848 --> 06:31:13.616
TICKET CARE CUSTOMER AND THE

06:31:13.683 --> 06:31:15.718

SAME PROTECTIONS OR INTENT

06:31:21.391 --> 06:31:21.825

TO BE HIGHER THAN THERE USUALLY

TAX EXEMPT BONDS ARE GOING TO

06:31:36.573 --> 06:31:37.974
BE A LOWER AND THE OTHER THING

06:31:38.041 --> 06:31:39.309
QUESTION I HAD IS WHY ISN'T L.

MUNICIPAL ONED UTILITIES WOULD

BE. IS THAT WOULD BE A NEW TAX

I PLAN ON STAYING HERE FOR A

06:33:04.794 --> 06:33:07.931
LONG TIME AND- I KNOW THAT- YOU

BORROW MONEY NOW. AT A LESS

06:33:12.368 --> 06:33:14.404
EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THE RATES ARE

06:33:14.470 --> 06:33:16.673
LOW THAT'S A THAT'S A FACT BUT

06:33:16.739 --> 06:33:17.407
WHEN YOU'RE BORROWING MONEY

06:33:17.473 --> 06:33:18.441

06:33:28.151 --> 06:33:30.486
GOOD DEAL FOR MY- CHILDREN TO

MOTHER NATURE AND WE NEED TO.

NATURE HAS BEEN DOING THIS

06:45:46.789 --> 06:45:48.357
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. IF

06:46:16.085 --> 06:46:18.020
COST. IF THERE WILL BE A COSTS

JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WORTHY OF

06:49:56.872 --> 06:49:58.874
A CHANGING THE POSITION OUR

06:49:58.941 --> 06:50:01.009
TRAJECTORY OF THIS BILL. THAT'S

06:50:01.076 --> 06:50:02.778
AS FAR AS OTHER REPAIRS CAN'T

06:50:02.844 --> 06:50:04.546
AFFORD IT THEY CAN AFFORD IT

06:50:04.613 --> 06:50:06.248

MONTH RIGHT NOW WHICH IS GOING

06:50:10.152 --> 06:50:13.855
TO LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO

06:50:13.922 --> 06:50:17.159
WITH THAT I ANSWER I'M. THANK

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

06:50:22.798 --> 06:50:23.932
SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS JUST LIKE

06:50:23.999 --> 06:50:25.801
EVERYONE ELSE I THOUGHT WE'D

06:50:25.867 --> 06:50:28.437
SEEN IT ALL- I WAS UP HERE TWO

06:50:28.503 --> 06:50:29.705
WEEKS AGO WHEN THE LIGHTNING

06:50:29.771 --> 06:50:31.606
STORMS HERE TODAY. I'VE BEEN IN

06:50:31.673 --> 06:50:34.009
A LOT OF LIGHTNING STORMS BUT

06:50:34.076 --> 06:50:35.577
THAT WAS LIKE A WAR ZONE AND IT

06:50:35.644 --> 06:50:36.778
MADE YOU WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT

06:50:36.845 --> 06:50:40.215
ELSE COULD HAPPEN TO THE STATE-

06:50:40.282 --> 06:50:41.483
YOU KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY OVERDUE

06:50:41.550 --> 06:50:42.718
FOR A GOOD EARTHQUAKE I DON'T

06:50:42.784 --> 06:50:43.819
WANT TO SAY IT BUT IT. MIGHT

06:50:43.885 --> 06:50:45.320
YOU KNOW SIX THREE TO TWELVE

06:50:45.387 --> 06:50:46.688
CERTAINLY HAD. SOME INTERESTING

06:50:46.755 --> 06:50:49.257
ISSUES BUT- THIS IDEA OF

06:50:49.324 --> 06:50:53.362
BORROWING- AT A VERY LOW RATE.

06:50:53.428 --> 06:50:55.797
IS A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT.

06:50:55.864 --> 06:50:59.801
UNLESS UNLESS WE- HAVE

06:50:59.868 --> 06:51:01.370
DEFLATION. AND WE FIND

06:51:01.436 --> 06:51:07.175
OURSELVES. BAYING WHERE THE

06:51:07.242 --> 06:51:11.480
MORE EXPENSIVE DOLLARS. ALONE

06:51:11.546 --> 06:51:13.515
IN THE FUTURE IT DIDN'T DIDN'T

06:51:13.582 --> 06:51:15.250
IT WILL HAVE BACKFIRED ON US

06:51:15.317 --> 06:51:17.486
AND I HAVE NOTHEARD THIS

06:51:17.552 --> 06:51:19.855
LEGISLATURE TALK ABOUT AS MUCH

06:51:19.921 --> 06:51:22.858
DEBT AS WE HAVE IN THE LAST FEW

06:51:22.924 --> 06:51:25.827
MONTHS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

06:51:25.894 --> 06:51:27.662
ASKING EMPLOYEES TO CUT THEIR

06:51:27.729 --> 06:51:29.965
PAY BUT ALL WE DID WAS GIVE

06:51:30.032 --> 06:51:30.799
THEM FOR LOS THAT THEY CAN

06:51:30.866 --> 06:51:32.834
BANKS AND THEY COULD CASH OUT

06:51:32.901 --> 06:51:34.936
LATER THAT'S BORROWING WE TOLD

06:51:35.003 --> 06:51:37.406
THEM THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO

06:51:37.472 --> 06:51:39.307
PAY INTO THEIR PAST ARE OTHER

06:51:39.374 --> 06:51:42.110
POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THE

06:51:42.177 --> 06:51:44.880
BEST STATS ANOTHER. INCREASING

06:51:44.946 --> 06:51:47.682
DEBT THAT'S CLOSE TO. NINETY

06:51:47.749 --> 06:51:49.284
BILLION DOLLARS IT JUST WE'RE

06:51:49.351 --> 06:51:50.952
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVING

06:51:51.019 --> 06:51:53.388
CORPORATIONS PREPAY THEIR-

06:51:53.455 --> 06:51:56.892
INCOME TAXES- IN IN SORT OF A

06:51:56.958 --> 06:51:59.161
CERTIFICATE IDEA. WE'RE

06:51:59.227 --> 06:52:00.662
BOUNCING AROUND SO MANY IDEAS

06:52:00.729 --> 06:52:03.732
ON ON DECK AND WE NEED TO STEP

06:52:03.799 --> 06:52:04.566
BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT IS

06:52:04.633 --> 06:52:07.969
CALIFORNIA DONE TO TRY TO

06:52:08.036 --> 06:52:10.005
ELECTRIFY. THIS STATE AND WE'VE

06:52:10.072 --> 06:52:11.706
DONE SOME THINGS IN RESPONSE TO

06:52:11.773 --> 06:52:13.408
CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE TRYING I

06:52:13.475 --> 06:52:14.876
APPRECIATE BUT WITH THE

06:52:14.943 --> 06:52:17.479
STATE'S. HYDRO AND NUCLEAR ARE

06:52:17.546 --> 06:52:19.614
NOT RENEWABLE AND THEN THE

06:52:19.681 --> 06:52:24.019
FORCE WIND. SOLAR MERA FARMS-

06:52:24.086 --> 06:52:26.321
WHICH ARE. YOU KNOW I WON'T

06:52:26.388 --> 06:52:28.490
EVEN GO DOWN THAT ROAD- AND

06:52:28.557 --> 06:52:30.659
THEN THE IN FORM THE I. O. USE

06:52:30.725 --> 06:52:31.326
THAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO ALL

06:52:31.393 --> 06:52:33.195
THESE THINGS. AND THEN WHAT DO

06:52:33.261 --> 06:52:34.629
THEY DO THEY DEFERRED

06:52:34.696 --> 06:52:36.665
MAINTENANCE STATE WHAT WHAT

06:52:36.731 --> 06:52:38.967
ELSE IS THERE BEING A YANKEES

06:52:39.034 --> 06:52:42.270
AND BACK AND FORTH AND THAT

06:52:42.337 --> 06:52:44.272
GIVES US THESE. TRANSMISSION

06:52:44.339 --> 06:52:45.907
LINES THAT ARE NOW OLD FREIGHT

06:52:45.974 --> 06:52:48.243
AND NEED TO BE REPAIRED SO I

06:52:48.310 --> 06:52:49.811
WOULD SAY THAT SACRAMENTO HAS

06:52:49.878 --> 06:52:51.913
NOT BEEN PROACTIVE IT HAS A

06:52:51.980 --> 06:52:56.585
LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. AND

06:52:56.651 --> 06:52:58.854
EXIST. SURE THIS BILL IS REACT.

06:52:58.920 --> 06:53:01.556
AND IS ARE. DO THIS ACKERMAN

06:53:01.623 --> 06:53:04.159
LACK OF. IT'S A LITTLE. BECAUSE

06:53:04.226 --> 06:53:06.094
CONSTANTLY YANKING I KNOW YOU

06:53:06.161 --> 06:53:07.963
WITH A J. AROUND THE ONE THIS

06:53:08.029 --> 06:53:10.866
WAY. AND THAT WAY ALL ITS- IS

06:53:10.932 --> 06:53:13.135
THAT CENTRO PLANNING IS A JOKE

06:53:13.201 --> 06:53:14.736
A SAD JOKE SO NOW THE SOLUTION

06:53:14.803 --> 06:53:16.371
IS X. SIR SEARCH. WHICH IS

06:53:16.438 --> 06:53:17.205
TANTAMOUNT TO ATTACK INCREASE

06:53:17.272 --> 06:53:18.840
IN THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF

06:53:18.907 --> 06:53:20.142
ANSWER WE SHOULD BE GIVING TO

06:53:20.208 --> 06:53:23.979
OUR CONSTITUENTS. THIS IS NOT A

06:53:24.045 --> 06:53:25.714
BILL. IT WOULD SEEM MORE

06:53:25.780 --> 06:53:26.681
REASONABLE TO PREPARE A

06:53:26.748 --> 06:53:29.084
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DROPPING OR

06:53:29.151 --> 06:53:30.919
MAYBE POSTPONING CERTAIN

06:53:30.986 --> 06:53:33.522
IDEOLOGIES AND RUN ARE YOU USED

06:53:33.588 --> 06:53:34.756
TO LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

06:53:34.823 --> 06:53:37.092
RUN. WITHOUT CONSTANTLY WHICH

06:53:37.159 --> 06:53:39.628
SIGN WHAT SHOULD BE. AND SHOULD

06:53:39.694 --> 06:53:41.429
HAVE BEEN A REASONABLE AND

06:53:41.496 --> 06:53:43.298
REALISTIC PROCESS TO PROPERLY

06:53:43.365 --> 06:53:46.268
ELECTRIFY. CALIFORNIA IN AND

06:53:46.334 --> 06:53:48.170
FOR THOSE REASONS AND MORE I AM

06:53:48.236 --> 06:53:50.372
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU

06:53:50.438 --> 06:53:53.308
MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU- CENTER

06:53:53.375 --> 06:53:55.877
MORLOCK- FOR MY OWN COMMENTS

06:53:55.944 --> 06:53:58.547
FIRST OF ALL. I AGREE THAT WE

06:53:58.613 --> 06:53:59.614
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO COMBAT

06:53:59.681 --> 06:54:01.650
WILDFIRES I THINK IT IS WITH IT

06:54:01.716 --> 06:54:03.919
IS A GROWING PROBLEM. AND I

06:54:03.985 --> 06:54:06.254
WANT TO THANK CENTER HERTZBERG

06:54:06.321 --> 06:54:08.456
CENTER ALAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

06:54:08.523 --> 06:54:10.425
BLOOM. FROM EARLY TRYING TO

06:54:10.492 --> 06:54:12.227
IRON OUT. THIS PROBLEM WORKING

06:54:12.294 --> 06:54:13.929
ON AND I REALLY REALLY BELIEVE

06:54:13.995 --> 06:54:16.198
YOU SHOULD BE COMMENDED. FOR

06:54:16.264 --> 06:54:16.831
YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND YOUR

06:54:16.898 --> 06:54:18.733
PASSION. HARD WORK ON THIS

06:54:18.800 --> 06:54:22.037
ISSUE AND- TRYING TO BRING AT

06:54:22.103 --> 06:54:22.637
LEAST SOMETHING FORWARD THAT

06:54:22.704 --> 06:54:25.807
WILL HELP- WITH BUT FIRE SHOULD.

06:54:25.874 --> 06:54:28.176
I JUST HAVE. AN ENORMOUS

06:54:28.243 --> 06:54:29.811
PROBLEM FOR YOU FOR USING

06:54:29.878 --> 06:54:32.747
RATEPAYER FUNDS TO CREATE A

06:54:32.814 --> 06:54:34.082
FIREFIGHTING PROGRAM THE STATE

06:54:34.149 --> 06:54:36.818
I THINK WE COULD. DEFINITELY

06:54:36.885 --> 06:54:37.886
GENERATE THOSE FUNDS FROM OTHER

06:54:37.953 --> 06:54:39.487
SOURCES AND I THINK WOULD BE

06:54:39.554 --> 06:54:41.489
MORE PRUDENT I DON'T THINK IT

06:54:41.556 --> 06:54:43.258
WOULD EVEN BE ALLOWABLE TO USE

06:54:43.325 --> 06:54:46.528
THESE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY TO

06:54:46.595 --> 06:54:50.265
FIGHT FIRES A KNOWLEDGE EXPLAIN

06:54:50.332 --> 06:54:54.336
WHY I SAY THAT. CURRENTLY OF

06:54:54.402 --> 06:54:56.504
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BILLIONS OF

06:54:56.571 --> 06:54:59.641
DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

06:54:59.708 --> 06:55:00.242
NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED TO HARDEN

06:55:00.308 --> 06:55:03.778
IT. TO MAKE IT MORE RESISTANCE

06:55:03.845 --> 06:55:06.448
TO FIRES AND TO. CLIMATE CHANGE

06:55:06.514 --> 06:55:11.486
WHICH IS. INSTIGATING WINDS

06:55:11.553 --> 06:55:13.488
THAT ARE HIGHER THAN AT AND

06:55:13.555 --> 06:55:17.025
MORE VIOLENT THAN MANY OF OUR

06:55:17.092 --> 06:55:17.659
INFRASTRUCTURE EVER COULD HAVE

06:55:17.726 --> 06:55:20.462
ENVISIONED. AND SO THESE THESE

06:55:20.528 --> 06:55:22.597
FUNDS SHOULD COME FROM REPAIR

06:55:22.664 --> 06:55:25.233
FUNDS WE ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS

06:55:25.300 --> 06:55:28.136
THAT ALLOWS THAT THROUGH THE PC.

06:55:28.203 --> 06:55:30.972
AS I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND I

06:55:31.039 --> 06:55:32.207
SEE HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE ONLY

06:55:32.274 --> 06:55:37.178
FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW THE DAY-

06:55:37.245 --> 06:55:39.748
PRIVATE UTILITIES TO- FIND THIS

06:55:39.814 --> 06:55:42.017
THIS PROGRAM. YOU KNOW I REALLY

06:55:42.083 --> 06:55:44.719
THINK IT DOESN'T COVER THE

06:55:44.786 --> 06:55:47.122
STATE STRATEGICALLY. AND I

06:55:47.188 --> 06:55:49.424
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THE PRIVATE

06:55:49.491 --> 06:55:51.359
UTILITIES COVER CALIFORNIA IT

06:55:51.426 --> 06:55:52.694
IS A LARGE SWATH BUTTER IN

06:55:52.761 --> 06:55:54.296
OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE OF THAT

06:55:54.362 --> 06:55:57.098
THEY ALSO NEED TO BE INCLUDED.

06:55:57.165 --> 06:55:59.367
IN IN A MITIGATION PROGRAM. AND

06:55:59.434 --> 06:56:01.369
THAT NEEDS TO REALLY BE FOUGHT

06:56:01.436 --> 06:56:03.772
OUT. AN END TO THE EXTENT THAT

06:56:03.838 --> 06:56:04.873
THESE REPAIR FUNDS SHOULD BE

06:56:04.939 --> 06:56:06.841
USED TO HARDEN THE GRID I

06:56:06.908 --> 06:56:08.576
SUPPORT THAT. AND IF THERE IS

06:56:08.643 --> 06:56:09.978
ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WILL

06:56:10.045 --> 06:56:11.279
SUPPORT THAT I WILL SUPPORT IT

06:56:11.346 --> 06:56:13.248
IS WELL IF IT GOES OUTSIDE OF

06:56:13.315 --> 06:56:14.182
THAT I WILL NOT BECAUSE THOSE

06:56:14.249 --> 06:56:16.451
ARE AREAS. THAT SHOULD BE

06:56:16.518 --> 06:56:18.653
INVESTED IN FROM OTHER FINANCE.

06:56:18.720 --> 06:56:21.256
I ALSO WANT TO ADD. THAT IS

06:56:21.323 --> 06:56:23.024
ILLEGAL COUNTY SINCE TWO

06:56:23.091 --> 06:56:25.393
THOUSAND NINE. AND CENTER

06:56:25.460 --> 06:56:27.595
MCGUIRE I JUST WANT TO. CORRECT

06:56:27.662 --> 06:56:29.230
YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE

06:56:29.297 --> 06:56:29.798
REALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM

06:56:29.864 --> 06:56:31.733
YOUR DISTRICT. BUT IN SAN DIEGO

06:56:31.800 --> 06:56:34.769
OUR OUR OUR TRAGEDY STARTED IN

06:56:34.836 --> 06:56:36.438
TWO THOUSAND THREE. WITH THE

06:56:36.504 --> 06:56:39.941
CEDAR CREEK FIRES. AND IN TWO

06:56:40.008 --> 06:56:40.608
THOUSAND SEVEN WE HAD A FIRE IN

06:56:40.675 --> 06:56:42.243
JULIAN THAT BASICALLY DESTROYED

06:56:42.310 --> 06:56:44.379
THE ENTIRE. I WOULD SAY MID

06:56:44.446 --> 06:56:45.847
MAJOR PART OF THE OF THE JULIAN

06:56:45.914 --> 06:56:47.882
FORCE THAT HAS NOT REGENERATED

06:56:47.949 --> 06:56:50.618
SINCE THEN. I DRIVE THERE EVERY

06:56:50.685 --> 06:56:54.022
NOW AND THEN AND I HAVEN'T SEEN

06:56:54.089 --> 06:56:54.656
OF A NEW PINE TREE GROW IN THAT

06:56:54.723 --> 06:56:55.690
AREA. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

06:56:55.757 --> 06:56:57.625
VERY DESTRUCTIVE FIRES ARE.

06:56:57.692 --> 06:57:00.562
RAVAGING OUR FORESTS. AND BACK

06:57:00.628 --> 06:57:02.330
THEN I REMEMBER A SCIENCE TO

06:57:02.397 --> 06:57:04.299
SAY THAT THAT FORCE WOULD NEVER

06:57:04.366 --> 06:57:05.934
COME BACK AND HE WAS RIGHT. AND

06:57:06.000 --> 06:57:07.802
THAT IS OF EXTREME CONCERN IF

06:57:07.869 --> 06:57:08.937
THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN OTHER

06:57:09.003 --> 06:57:10.638
PARTS OF STATE I UNDERSTAND

06:57:10.705 --> 06:57:12.707
THAT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE FOUND.%

06:57:12.774 --> 06:57:15.410
OTHER OTHER SOURCES TO FIND.

06:57:15.477 --> 06:57:16.177
TREE PLANTINGS AND OTHER

06:57:16.244 --> 06:57:18.413
PROJECTS BUT- IN SAN DIEGO WE

06:57:18.480 --> 06:57:20.348
STARTED ORG HARDENING THE GRID

06:57:20.415 --> 06:57:23.551
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. SINCE TWO

06:57:23.618 --> 06:57:24.686
THOUSAND NINE IN SAN DIEGO

06:57:24.753 --> 06:57:27.122
RATEPAYERS HAVE SUPPORTED TWO

06:57:27.188 --> 06:57:28.523
BILLION DOLLARS OF HARDENING

06:57:28.590 --> 06:57:31.693
PROJECTS. THAT INCLUDE A

06:57:31.760 --> 06:57:33.228
WEATHER STATION THAT INCLUDE A

06:57:33.294 --> 06:57:35.797
RAPID. RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE

06:57:35.864 --> 06:57:37.832
THAT HAVE REALLY HELPED TO

06:57:37.899 --> 06:57:40.268
REDUCE NEW FIRES THAT COULD

06:57:40.335 --> 06:57:43.338
HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HARMFUL.

06:57:43.405 --> 06:57:46.174
THAT TWO BILLION HAS BEEN MADE.

06:57:46.241 --> 06:57:48.676
OVER OVER A DECADE. AND HAS

06:57:48.743 --> 06:57:50.745
BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AT

06:57:50.812 --> 06:57:52.247
MITIGATING THESE WILDFIRES

06:57:52.313 --> 06:57:54.215
THAT'S WHY WHEN I SEE THAT

06:57:54.282 --> 06:57:56.251
ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL AMOUNT

06:57:56.317 --> 06:57:58.253
MAYBE A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE

06:57:58.319 --> 06:58:00.188
OF THREE. BILLION DOLLARS

06:58:00.255 --> 06:58:01.890
BILLION- FURTHER BURDENING

06:58:01.956 --> 06:58:04.259
RATEPAYERS IN SAN DIEGO WHEN WE

06:58:04.325 --> 06:58:05.560
HAVE A PROGRAM WE'VE HAD

06:58:05.627 --> 06:58:06.528
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

06:58:06.594 --> 06:58:07.629
WORKING ON FOR YEARS TO HARDEN

06:58:07.695 --> 06:58:10.398
THE GRID. YES THERE ARE MORE

06:58:10.465 --> 06:58:13.168
THINGS TO DO. AND THAT WHAT

06:58:13.234 --> 06:58:15.603
THAT PROCESS IS ALREADY ALLOWED

06:58:15.670 --> 06:58:17.539
UNDER THE P. YOU SEE AND- THE

06:58:17.605 --> 06:58:21.376
PC CAN MORE EXACTLY. ALLOW THE

06:58:21.443 --> 06:58:23.545
UTILITIES TO INVEST IN AREAS TO

06:58:23.611 --> 06:58:26.247
HARDEN THE GRID. IN WAYS THAT

06:58:26.314 --> 06:58:29.651
WILL PROTECT NOT ONLY THE RATE

06:58:29.717 --> 06:58:31.586
PAYERS BUT ALSO PROTECT. THE

06:58:31.653 --> 06:58:35.123
YOU PUT THE UTILITIES FROM OF

06:58:35.190 --> 06:58:36.658
HAVING THEIR EQUIPMENT SPARKED

06:58:36.724 --> 06:58:39.027
FIRE SO WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME

06:58:39.093 --> 06:58:41.196
THAT THIS IS ABOUT. PARTY IN

06:58:41.262 --> 06:58:43.064
THE GRID I DON'T I REALLY DON'T

06:58:43.131 --> 06:58:44.566
BY THAT BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE

06:58:44.632 --> 06:58:47.202
THAT MECHANISM ALLOWED WITHIN

06:58:47.268 --> 06:58:49.704
THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC

06:58:49.771 --> 06:58:51.606
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROP

06:58:51.673 --> 06:58:53.775
PROCESS AND SCRUTINIZE. THOSE

06:58:53.842 --> 06:58:56.110
PROPOSALS AND REALLY LOOK AT

06:58:56.177 --> 06:58:57.779
HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO BE

06:58:57.846 --> 06:58:59.747
INVESTED IN HARDENING THE GRID.

06:58:59.814 --> 06:59:01.883
AND HOW MUCH IS REALLY HOW FOR

06:59:01.950 --> 06:59:03.718
HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO GO TO

06:59:03.785 --> 06:59:05.820
HELP PREVENT WILDFIRES AND

06:59:05.887 --> 06:59:08.990
DISASTERS IN OUR STATE. BUT I

06:59:09.057 --> 06:59:10.124
THINK I'VE I'VE I'VE SAID

06:59:10.191 --> 06:59:12.126
ENOUGH I HAVE A HARD TIME

06:59:12.193 --> 06:59:14.062
SUPPORTING THIS JUST BECAUSE

06:59:14.128 --> 06:59:15.930
HONESTLY I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD

06:59:15.997 --> 06:59:17.098
ENOUGH TIME TO SCRUTINIZE THIS

06:59:17.165 --> 06:59:18.900
BILL AND THIS IS A VERY

06:59:18.967 --> 06:59:21.269
COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT FROM THE

06:59:21.336 --> 06:59:22.604
STANDPOINT OF WHERE I'M COMING

06:59:22.670 --> 06:59:24.272
FROM I SEE THAT WE COULD STILL

06:59:24.339 --> 06:59:26.508
MOVE FORWARD. AND MAKE THOSE

06:59:26.574 --> 06:59:29.511
INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR WE RAISED

06:59:29.577 --> 06:59:30.745
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO COMBAT

06:59:30.812 --> 06:59:32.614
WILDFIRES AND THAT WAS

06:59:32.680 --> 06:59:34.916
IMMEDIATELY THAT'S MONEY THAT

06:59:34.983 --> 06:59:37.685
IS HAS BEEN SPENT AND IS BEING

06:59:37.752 --> 06:59:40.855
SPENT TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT TO

06:59:40.922 --> 06:59:45.927
COMBAT FIRES TWO OF. WORK ON

06:59:45.994 --> 06:59:48.763
SUPPRESSION PROJECTS THAT WILL

06:59:48.830 --> 06:59:50.398
PREVENT FIRES AND IF WE CAN

06:59:50.465 --> 06:59:51.966
WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT

06:59:52.033 --> 06:59:53.501
COVERS THE ENTIRE STATE

06:59:53.568 --> 06:59:55.470
STRATEGICALLY AND LOOKS AT HOW

06:59:55.537 --> 06:59:59.440
WILDFIRE AREAS AND COMES UP

06:59:59.507 --> 07:00:00.041
WITH A STRATEGY I WILL SUPPORT

07:00:00.108 --> 07:00:03.011
IT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I FIND

07:00:03.077 --> 07:00:04.846
MYSELF IN A TOUGH PLACE BETWEEN

07:00:04.913 --> 07:00:07.682
FRIENDS ON BOTH SIDES AND

07:00:07.749 --> 07:00:10.218
INTERESTS ON BOTH SIDES THAT.

07:00:10.285 --> 07:00:11.052
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE

07:00:11.119 --> 07:00:13.321
AND- HIGH IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT

07:00:13.388 --> 07:00:15.690

TO. BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY BY

07:00:17.892 --> 07:00:20.028
PROGRAM. AND WE DO NEED TO PUT

EXHAUSTED HOPEFULLY THAT COULD

07:00:36.678 --> 07:00:40.582

STABILIZE THE- THE RATINGS SO

07:01:41.709 --> 07:01:42.176
THEY COULD ACTUALLY BORROW

07:01:42.243 --> 07:01:44.712
MONEY. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT

07:01:44.779 --> 07:01:46.881
THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY. MAKE

07:01:46.948 --> 07:01:48.216
IT EVEN HARDER FOR THEM TO

07:01:48.282 --> 07:01:48.983
BORROW MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE

PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK IN

07:05:40.514 --> 07:05:42.049
MARRYING THAT ISSUE WHICH IS

07:05:42.116 --> 07:05:42.950
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE'VE BEEN

07:05:43.017 --> 07:05:44.185
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

07:05:44.252 --> 07:05:46.153
ECONOMIC RECOVERY ISSUE. WE'RE

07:05:46.220 --> 07:05:48.222
TRYING NOT TO PUT BURDENS ON

07:05:48.289 --> 07:05:48.923
THE STATE BUDGET WHICH THAT

07:05:48.990 --> 07:05:51.592
IMPACTS DEVELOPING DISABLED AND

07:05:51.659 --> 07:05:53.227
MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL THE OTHER

07:05:53.294 --> 07:05:54.695
EDUCATION OTHER THINGS THAT WE

07:05:54.762 --> 07:05:57.832
HAVE CHALLENGES FOR. INCOMING

07:05:57.899 --> 07:05:59.066
AND BEING CREATIVE. THE IMPACT

07:05:59.133 --> 07:06:01.202
OF THIS IS NOT UNTIL TWENTY

07:06:01.269 --> 07:06:03.137
THIRTY SIX. THERE'S NEVER BEEN

07:06:03.204 --> 07:06:05.039
A BETTER TIME TO BORROW.

07:06:05.106 --> 07:06:06.774
SENATOR BILL SENT ME A NOTE AND

07:06:06.841 --> 07:06:08.009
I THINK HE'S RIGHT IF YOU LOOK

07:06:08.075 --> 07:06:10.244
AT INFLATION FACTORS VERSUS THE

07:06:10.311 --> 07:06:12.179
ABILITY TO SET THE RATE NOW.

07:06:12.246 --> 07:06:14.015
THAT'S THE KEY WE CAN BORROW

07:06:14.081 --> 07:06:15.983
NOW AT A CHEAPER RATE. THE

07:06:16.050 --> 07:06:17.952
GOVERNMENT ARE LEGISLATURE HAS

07:06:18.019 --> 07:06:20.087
THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE. THESE

07:06:20.154 --> 07:06:21.656
OTHER ISSUES WITH THE ABILITY

07:06:21.722 --> 07:06:23.090
TO DEBATE THE ISSUE IS TO

07:06:23.157 --> 07:06:26.360
NEXUS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT

07:06:26.427 --> 07:06:28.396
WE MAKE A BIG STATEMENT. GOING

07:06:28.462 --> 07:06:30.464
FORWARD. THAT THIS REALLY ISN'T

07:06:30.531 --> 07:06:31.666
JUST MOVING THE DOLLARS I WANT

07:06:31.732 --> 07:06:35.102
TO SHARE. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

07:06:35.169 --> 07:06:36.570
SOME OF THE BIG RATING AGENCIES.

07:06:36.637 --> 07:06:37.471
AND WHAT THE BECAUSE I'M

07:06:37.538 --> 07:06:38.773
NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BORING I

07:06:38.839 --> 07:06:39.507
THOUGHT WAS CENTER MORE LIKE

07:06:39.573 --> 07:06:40.975
CITIES RIGHT I'M CONCERNED

07:06:41.042 --> 07:06:43.044
ABOUT WHAT HE SAID. BUT WHAT

07:06:43.110 --> 07:06:45.780
THEY TELL US AS WE FACE THIS

07:06:45.846 --> 07:06:47.114
PANDEMIC. THE FIRES AND ALL THE

07:06:47.181 --> 07:06:49.784
THINGS. THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED

07:06:49.850 --> 07:06:52.553
IS DO WE OFFER A VISION FORWARD

07:06:52.620 --> 07:06:54.822
THAN WHAT THE DEBT EQUITY RATIO

07:06:54.889 --> 07:06:57.224
IS. DO WE HAVE A PLAN AS A

07:06:57.291 --> 07:07:01.395
GOVERNMENT. TO MOVE FORWARD TO

07:07:01.462 --> 07:07:02.797
BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE

07:07:02.863 --> 07:07:03.898
CHALLENGES AND MITIGATE THE

07:07:03.965 --> 07:07:05.967
RISK THAT'S THE BIGGER THING

07:07:06.033 --> 07:07:07.401
WHEN THEY LOOK TO A RATING

07:07:07.468 --> 07:07:09.603
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

07:07:09.670 --> 07:07:11.138
I DO KNOW THAT WE OFTEN FACE

07:07:11.205 --> 07:07:12.340
THAT ISSUE OF THE YOU KNOW OUR

07:07:12.406 --> 07:07:14.041
DEBT RATING IN THE LIGHT. BUT

07:07:14.108 --> 07:07:15.376
I'M TELLING YOU WE HAVE VETTED

07:07:15.443 --> 07:07:17.745
THIS WITH FOLKS DEALING WITH

ARGUMENT WITH RELATED

07:07:30.324 --> 07:07:32.626
TRANSPARENCY IS WRONG. BECAUSE
