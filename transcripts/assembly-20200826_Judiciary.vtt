WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:07.832
PROCESS TO REVOKE CERTIFICATION

AS POLLS TO INVESTIGATE.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.529
GROUNDS FOR MISCONDUCT. WE

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.797
SHOULD ALSO BE CREATING AN

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.866
ADVISORY BOARD. WITH THE

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:44.068
IMPULSE THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:45.903
RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POLL

THIS FOR WOULD BE MADE UP OF

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:52.243
PRIMARILY OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.210
INDIVIDUALS APPOINTED BY THE

RELATED TO POLICE MISCONDUCT.

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:01.852
THERE'S CONCERN THAT THIS IS A

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:04.255
BIAS TOWARD OFFICERS AND THAT

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.157
THE PROPOSITION IS NOT SIMILAR

BOARDS OF OTHER LICENSED

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:12.597
PROFESSIONS. THE TRUTH IS THAT

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.231
THE PUBLIC DOES NOT TRUST LAW

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:15.666
ENFORCEMENT TO POLICE

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.034
THEMSELVES WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:19.737
EXAMPLES. FROM MILLIONS OF

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:22.139
PROTESTERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:26.277

MR BLIGHT. IN WISCONSIN PEOPLE

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:36.287
DO NOT TRUST THE POLICE TO DO

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:38.823
THIS JOB. THE BOARD DOES NOT

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:41.292
HAVE THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:43.160
THE CERTIFYING AN OFFICER AND A

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.261
BILL DOES NOT REMOVE DUE

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:49.367
PROCESS FOR AN OFFICER. TO

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:49.767
APPEAL THE BOARD'S

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:50.835
RECOMMENDATION SOME OTHER LIFE

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:52.803
FOR THIS WOULD STOP THE LIE FEE

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:56.340
TO THE BE DETERMINED BY THE

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:57.308
COMMISSION SHALL NOT X. THE- TO

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.644
ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM. THIS

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.412
BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:05.383
THE FINE BY REGULATION THE

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.083
SPECIFIC GROUNDS OF SERIOUS

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.986
MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:10.187
CONSIDERED FOR DECERTIFICATION.

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:12.623
THERE'S THERE IS CONCERN THAT

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.357
THE GROUNDS OF THE

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.493
CERTIFICATION ARE TOO BROAD AND

00:38:15.559 --> 00:38:18.562
WE WOULD TO CERTIFY OFFICERS

00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:19.063
WHO HAVE COMMITTED A TRY

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.633
VIOLATION. THIS IS NOT MY

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.200
INTENT OR THE INTENT OF THIS

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:25.269
BILL AT ALL. AND I DO NOT

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:26.570
EXPECT COMMISSION COMPOSED

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.105
MAINLY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:31.108
ACCESS ENACT SUCH A DEFINITION.

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:32.777
THIS BILL ALSO MAKES CHANGES TO

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:34.512
THE TOM BAIN CIVIL RIGHTS ACT

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:36.647
IT CLARIFIES THE GENERAL INTENT

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:39.283
TO INTERFERE WITH A PERSON'S

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.018
CIVIL RIGHTS INSTINET. IS OF

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:43.721
SUFFICIENT TO BRING A SUIT

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.556
UNDER THE BANNER. IT ENSURES

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:47.058
THAT A FAMILY MEMBER OF A

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.993
PERSON KILLED BY LAW

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.395
ENFORCEMENT ALSO HAS. ALSO ALSO

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.364
IS ALSO ABLE TO ASSERT A CALLS

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:56.600
OF ACTION. AND FINALLY IT

00:38:56.667 --> 00:39:00.371
CLARIFIES THAT THREE IMMUNITIES.

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:01.906
CALLING ASSERTED BY LAW

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:04.108
ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT COMPARABLE

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.176
TO CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE BAN

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:08.145
ACT. THIS IS A VITAL IN TO

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:10.047
INCREASE LONG FOR ACCOUNT. AND

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.649
RESTORE COMMUNITY TRUST IN LAW

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:13.184
ENFORCEMENT IT GIVES THEM SOME

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.652
SKIN IN THE GAME AND I THINK IT

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.687
MAKES OFFICE WANT TO PER FORM A

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.055
LITTLE BIT MORE RESPONSIBILITY

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:19.824
FOR THOSE BAD ACTORS NOT THE

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.026
ONES THAT PERFORM AN HONORABLE

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:24.128
WAY ON A DAILY BASIS. LASTLY I

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.529
WANT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:27.598
THAT WE HAVE NOT ENGAGE WITH

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.233
LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.836
COMPLETELY UNTRUE. THE BEST WAY

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:33.504
I CAN DESCRIBE IT IS FAKE NEWS.

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:35.406
OUR OFFICE IS MADE OURSELVES

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:37.274
AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:39.510
AND HAS NEVER REFUSED ANY

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.579
MEETING. AND I SIT HERE TODAY

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.447
BEFORE YOU AS A MEMBER OF THIS

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:45.382
LEGISLATURE BODY OF ALMOST TEN

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.218
YEARS. AND I'VE NEVER MISSED A

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:48.419
DAY OF WORK I'M ALWAYS

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:50.855
AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO'S EVER

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:55.426
WANTED TO MEET WITH ME.

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:56.060
LAFORTUNE HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:57.361
THIS PROCESS AND HAVE ENGAGE

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:58.229
DIRECTLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:00.965
OFFICE ON THE BILL'S LANGUAGE.

00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:03.167
THIS BILL LARGELY REPRESENTS

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.735
THE STRUCTURE OF THE GOLDEN

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:05.603
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:08.205

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:08.773
FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT FROM

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:11.075
BEGINNING. BUT PUSHES FURTHER

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.543
ON PROVISIONS THAT WE BELIEVE

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.178
CREATE MORE EFFECTIVENESS WE

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:15.880
I'VE ALSO HAD EXTENSIVE

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.448
CONVERSATIONS WITH. ALL OF YOUR

BOOKS HERE ARE TURNING GENERAL

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.451
WHO SHARED SOME OF HIS CONCERNS

OUR NATION'S HISTORY. I ALSO

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.480
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT MY CLIENT

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:13.883
SUPPORTS A LICENSE REVOKED

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:17.219
CATION PROCESS AND TO THAT END

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.788
WE WORK TIRELESSLY. WITH THE

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.390
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHER

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.659
STAKEHOLDERS. TO ESTABLISH A

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.394
FAIR AND WORKABLE LICENSING

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:29.198
SYSTEM. THAT ASSIST IN STRIKING

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:31.033
THE PROPER BALANCE THAT

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.335
ADDRESSES LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.904
OVER BAD OFFICERS AVOIDING

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.705
ACCOUNTABILITY WHILE

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:37.973
MAINTAINING FUNDAMENTAL

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.975

FAIRNESS AND PROTECTING THE

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:44.446
INNOCENT OFFICERS. OUR GOAL IS

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.682
TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM WHERE

MISCONDUCT. WITH THE POWER TO

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.356
REVOKE. AND WE BELIEVE THEY

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:55.157
SHOULD HAVE THE POWER TO ALSO

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:58.093
SUSPEND CERTIFICATION OF BAD

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.829

ALLEGATIONS. MADE AGAINST THEM

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.338
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:11.373

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.676
PROFESSION THERE ARE INHERENT

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:16.412
INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE

FALSE COMPLAINTS AGAINST

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.748
OFFICERS AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:20.449
THAT EVERY COMPLAINT OF

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:23.619
MISCONDUCT. IS FALSE BUT IF YOU

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:24.887

SAYS AND THOSE INCENTIVES

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:32.861

WITH OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:37.299
THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IN MY

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:40.669
VIEW. OUR GOAL WAS. TO HAVE A

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.305
SYSTEM WHERE AGENCIES ARE

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:44.406

MAKE SURE THAT OFFICERS ARE NOT

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:57.186
ABLE TO LEAVE AN AGENCY AND GO

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:58.921

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.857
CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.892
WE BELIEVE THAT. BY HAVING A

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.061
SYSTEM WHERE THE INVESTIGATION

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:07.563
MUST BE COMPLETED THAT WOULD

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.965
ALLOW POST A MORE COMPLETE

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:20.368
PLEASE SO. THE FRUSTRATION HERE

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:23.504
IS- THAT WE HAVE OTHER SECTIONS

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:24.505
OF THE BILL THAT REFER TO

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:27.208
SERIOUS CRIMES FELONIES THAT

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.409
WOULD RESULT IN DECERTIFICATION

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.510
AND THIS IS JUST KIND OF

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:32.213
ANOTHER SECTION THAT SAYS- ANY

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.081
VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND IN IT

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.516
I'M ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE IT

SAYS LAW IT DOES NOT SAY. A

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.586
CRIME COMMISSION OF A CRIME

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:39.687
IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE LAW

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:41.622
WHICH COULD BE EXTENDED TO

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.624
SOMETHING STATUTORY. I MEAN A

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:44.692
UNIFORM VIOLATION THAT'S A

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:45.726
VIOLATION OF SOMETHING THAT'S

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:46.961
IN STATE STATUTE THAT THAT

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:48.462

THIS PARTICULAR SECTION I IS

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:09.750
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE I FEEL IT

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.352
IS. MISERABLE IF YOU HAVE A

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:13.120
SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR A WITNESS

ADDITIONAL TESTS SO HERE'S MY

01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:18.926

ACTUALLY VIOLATE THE LAW COULD

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.701
DO THAT- LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:30.671
A PARKING TICKET BEING USED. TO

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:33.607

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:36.010
TO. THAT WILL. ONE OF THE

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:38.612
CONCERNS. J. WILL THE RATE IF I

01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:41.315
HAD MORE TIME. GET YOU APTLY

POINTED OUT THERE'S ALREADY A

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.653
REQUIREMENT FOR DECERTIFICATION

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.488
IF AN OFFICER COMMITS A FELONY

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.056
SO IF WE'RE EXPANDING THAT

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.858
OTHER VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.827
NECESSARILY IS TALKING ABOUT

01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:54.662
MORE MINOR VIOLATIONS ALL THE

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.197
WAY DWN TO INFRACTIONS OR AS

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:58.799
YOU POINTED OUT. VIOLATIONS OF

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:03.971
NON CRIMINAL STATUTES OKAY.

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:05.473
SENATOR AYE AYE I THINK THAT

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:07.341
YOUR- YOU'RE DOING GOOD WORK IN

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.843
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:11.579
I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED I

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:12.646
APOLOGIZE WHAT WHAT THAT

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.915
PROSTRATION CHAU I'M FRUSTRATED

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:15.549
BECAUSE I PERSONALLY AGREE WITH

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:17.184
YOU. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:18.519
CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:19.754
CALIFORNIA I AGREE WITH YOU

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:20.921
THAT POLICE OFFICER SHOULD BE

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:22.323
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:23.958
ACTIONS AND I THINK MOST POLICE

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:26.193
OFFICERS WOULD AGREE. THAT IT

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.396
HELPS THEM IF WE ESTABLISH LAWS

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:30.798
THAT PREVENT BAD OFFICERS FROM

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:31.332
MOVING FROM DEPARTMENT TO

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:33.601
DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT BUT

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:34.268
UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THIS BILL

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.237
IS WRITTEN. IT'S WRITTEN IN

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:37.705
SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S VERY

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.740
DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE THAT CARES

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:40.708
ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS TO VOTE

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.443
FOR IT AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.511
FRUSTRATED I FIND IT HARD

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:44.278
BREAKING IT AND SO I WOULD

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:45.946
ENCOURAGE YOU SHOULD JUST GO

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:47.448
MOVE FORWARD TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:48.816
THAT SECTION WHICH IS THE

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:49.550
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:51.752
SECTION. OF THE BILL AND

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:54.088
PERHAPS FIVE DEFINE WAS MORE

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:55.589
SPECIFICITY EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:56.590
TALKING ABOUT AND I DON'T EVEN

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:58.426
THINK THAT THAT PARTICULAR-

01:34:58.492 --> 01:34:59.393
SENTENCE NEEDS TO BE IN THERE

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.361
BECAUSE ELSEWHERE IN THE BILL

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:03.464

CONFUSED AS TO WHY WE WOULD BE

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:18.852
LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S MILITARY

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:19.453
CONTACT ONCE THEY WERE ALREADY

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.487
HIRED BY POLICE DEPARTMENT

TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER THE

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:29.129
INITIAL ELIGIBILITY TO BE

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:31.598
CERTIFIED INCOME POLICE OFFICER

ALSO SAYSIN THE MILITARY SO I

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:41.308

THAT AND YET IT DOESN'T. THERE

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:29.123
HAS TO BE SOME DETERMINATION

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:30.491
WHETHER THAT CRIME IS A

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:31.658

IT IS NOT A FALLING IN

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.008
CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD PROVE. TO

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:23.884
THOROUGH LETTER TO THE JOURNAL

THINK THERE'S A LOT HERE

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:32.392
THAT'S- IT MAYBE I'M- BEING

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:33.593
GENETIC BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.395
WOULD DO. TO YOU IF IT WAS AN

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:36.563
APPROPRIATIONS RIGHT NOW WE

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:37.764
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:42.302
APARTMENTS I'M SORRY- DOES IT.

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:43.136
REALLY DOES THE BILL REQUIRE

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:45.472
POSTED TRAIN OFFICERS. ABOUT

01:45:45.539 --> 01:45:46.973
THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS ARE

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.709
WE CRAZY ARE ARE WE ALSO GOING

01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:50.544
TO HAVE IMPOSED THAT WHEN. WHEN

OFFICERS DO THE POSTING THEY'RE

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:52.345
GONNA LEARN ABOUT

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:54.381
DECERTIFICATION. WE HAVEN'T

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:55.882
DRILLED DOWN THAT FAR BUT I

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:57.784
THINK THAT WOULD BE. A

01:45:57.851 --> 01:45:58.752
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT

01:45:58.819 --> 01:45:59.953
TO LEARN ABOUT WHILE YOU'RE IN

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.555
IT. ACADEMY THOSE VIOLATIONS

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:02.756
THAT WOULD LEAD TO

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.491
DECERTIFICATION SO I THINK IF.

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:05.726
AGENCIES ARE REALLY CONCERNED

01:46:05.792 --> 01:46:06.960
ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:10.297
THEY WOULD HAVE SOME SECTION

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:10.931
IN. TRAINING THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:12.332
THAT. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:13.800
HAS TO DO IT IT'S IT IN I

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:15.702
ACTUALLY THINK. I HOPE THE

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:17.604
ANSWER IS WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:18.171
BUT IF. IT IS GOING TO GO TO

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:19.906

LOOKING AT THIS- UP SIX

01:50:06.333 --> 01:50:08.068

I READ THIS STATUTE IS PUTTING

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:14.174
IN CONTEXT. IT SEEMS TO ME- THE

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.308
BEGINNING OF THAT SECTION SAYS

01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:18.011
THAT ITS POSTED HAS. THE TASK

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:19.579
OF PASSING THESE REGULATIONS SO

THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DECIDE

WHICH OF THESE. VIOLATIONS

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:32.192
WOULD COUNT WHAT I DID.OKAY

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:33.827
THAT OBVIOUSLY GIVES ME I THINK

01:50:33.893 --> 01:50:36.296
MUCH MORE SALAS IF IT WERE. NOT

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:37.263
FOR SOME FOLKS I THINK IT WOULD

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:38.732
BE A CREDIBLE. DISCUSSION BUT

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:42.035
IN THIS PART IN THIS CASE IT'S-

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:46.373
IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT- I KNOW WE

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:47.574
RECEIVED OF OFFICES LETTERS

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.309
DESCRIBE THIS BILL I A CO ON.

01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:51.111

FIVE STATES THAT DOESN'T HAVE A

DECERTIFICATION. SO THIS BILL

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.255
IS BASICALLY ASK US TO DO FORTY

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:03.556

CAN ARTICULATE HOW THIS BILL IS

01:51:05.592 --> 01:51:06.826
MAJORLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER

THE SENSE THAT QUESTION WAS THE

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:49.469
QUESTION WAS WHAT'S DIFFERENT

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:51.938
ABOUT THIS BILL VERSUS THE

WAS TRYING TO GET IT ALL GET

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:01.381
THERE FASTER IS THAT THERE IS

01:52:23.536 --> 01:52:26.072

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:54.047
COMMITTEE WANTS TO SEE. THE

01:55:54.113 --> 01:55:56.215
RESPECT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:58.851
IMPROVE. AND AS SOMEONE WHO

01:55:58.918 --> 01:55:59.519
USED TO BE PART OF LAW

01:55:59.585 --> 01:56:00.553
ENFORCEMENT AS A FORMER

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.988
PROSECUTOR THAT'S CERTAINLY MY

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:03.623
PERSPECTIVE AND- I WOULD SAY

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.892
THE REALLY SORT OF TWO REASONS

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.360
WHY I'M ON I WILL BE VOTING FOR

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:09.095
THIS BILL TODAY. FIRST HAS TO

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:10.229
DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:11.564
ONE OF FIVE STATES THAT HAS NOT

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:13.266
SET UP A PROCESS AND- I THINK

01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:14.300
THAT'S FRANKLY EMBARRASSING

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:16.369
MISTAKEN ALSO ON TO DO THAT.

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:17.570
AND WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:21.874
CONSTITUENTS. LOUDLY AND

01:56:21.941 --> 01:56:22.442
CLEARLY THAT. JUSTICE CAN'T

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:23.076
WAIT THIS AREA CAN. CAN WAIT WE

01:56:23.142 --> 01:56:25.445
TO DO SO AND THEN I WOULD ALSO

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:26.713
SUGGEST THAT. YOU KNOW. AS

01:56:26.779 --> 01:56:28.014
SOMEONE WHO SERVES ON THE

01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:29.015
BUSINESS OF PROFESSIONS

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:30.683
COMMITTEE WITH A NUMBER OF YOU.

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:31.951
WILL NEED TO SET PROFESSIONAL

01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:33.753
CONDUCT STANDARDS. THIS IS WHAT

01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.922
WE DO AND A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:56:35.988 --> 01:56:37.790
INSTANCES. I'M ACTUALLY AT THIS

01:56:37.857 --> 01:56:39.559
MOMENT READING A BOOK ABOUT THE

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:41.361
NINETEEN EIGHTEEN FLU. AND

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:44.097
FOLKS MAY NOT KNOW THAT- YEARS

01:56:44.163 --> 01:56:46.366
AGO. THE MEDICAL PROFESSION

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:49.268
DIDN'T HAVE ANY REGULATION AND

01:56:49.335 --> 01:56:50.403
IT WAS VIEWED. AS A

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:52.305
PROFESSIONAL CHARLATANS OF THE

01:56:52.372 --> 01:56:53.172
FOLKS WHO WHO LITERALLY

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:55.441
PRACTICING. MEDICINE AND IT WAS

01:56:55.508 --> 01:56:56.843
THE STANDARDS THAT WERE

01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:59.145
ESTABLISHED IN THAT FIELD IN

01:56:59.212 --> 01:56:59.979
THE TEACHING FIELD AND THE

01:57:00.046 --> 01:57:01.314
DENTIST REVEALED THE NURSING

01:57:01.381 --> 01:57:03.583
FIELD. THAT HAVE RAISED UP.

01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:05.852
PEOPLE'S RESPECT FOR- THOSE

01:57:05.918 --> 01:57:07.887
ENTITIES. THIS IS A COMMITTEE.

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:09.222
THAT ADDRESSES THE PROFESSIONAL

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:10.990
CONDUCT STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.992
TO LAWYERS. AND AS A LAWYER I

01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:14.627
THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING AND-

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:16.095
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:17.563
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

01:57:17.630 --> 01:57:18.831
PARTICULARLY OF A PROFESSION

01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:20.600
THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO USE

01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:22.602
FORCE. AGAINST OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:24.270
THAT WE ARE HOLDING. OUR

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:25.204
OFFICERS TO THE HIGHEST

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:26.706
STANDARD OF PROFESSIONALISM SO.

01:57:26.773 --> 01:57:29.942
I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT SUPPORTING

01:57:30.009 --> 01:57:31.344
THIS BILL OR THAT THE CONCEPT

01:57:31.411 --> 01:57:36.549
OF THIS BILL. IS REALLY. ABOUT

01:57:36.616 --> 01:57:37.250
SUPPORTING. PROFESSIONAL

01:57:37.316 --> 01:57:39.485
CONTEXT IN. MY HOPE IS THAT THE

01:57:39.552 --> 01:57:41.354
AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY IS TO CONTINUE

01:57:41.421 --> 01:57:42.388
WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS

01:57:42.455 --> 01:57:44.490
BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

01:57:44.557 --> 01:57:46.058
ABOUT THIS AND- AND WITH THAT

01:57:46.125 --> 01:57:47.693
I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:50.930
THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER MR

01:57:50.997 --> 01:57:54.934
HOLDEN. YES THANK YOU SIR

01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:57.203
BRADFORD AYE I THINK THAT IT I

01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:59.372
WANTED TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT-

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:01.274
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING JUST

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.209
HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:06.679
WORK WITH YOU- FOR AN EXTENDED

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:07.447
NUMBER OF MONTHS BECAUSE WE

01:58:07.513 --> 01:58:10.550
HAD- COMPARE BOWLING COMPATIBLE

01:58:10.616 --> 01:58:13.352
BILLS- THAT WERE MOVING THROUGH

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:16.055
THE PROCESS- INTO RECENTLY BUT

01:58:16.122 --> 01:58:17.790
IT RECOGNIZING THAT YOUR

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:20.193
COMMITMENT. AND WORKING WITH

01:58:20.259 --> 01:58:23.262
STAKEHOLDERS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN

01:58:23.329 --> 01:58:25.264
ESTABLISHED AND I KNOW THAT AS

01:58:25.331 --> 01:58:27.200
WE'VE TALKED OF YOU HAVE

01:58:27.266 --> 01:58:29.469
REFERENCED THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:58:29.535 --> 01:58:31.437
AS WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND-

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:33.506
ELEMENTS OF ARBIL SO I JUST

01:58:33.573 --> 01:58:35.241
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS ON

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:37.143
THE RECORD ALSO WANTED TO.

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:39.545
THANK YOU FOR. PURSUING THIS

01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:41.280
TYPE OF LEGISLATION I KNOW IT'S

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:44.450
NOT EASY- AND I THINK THAT AS

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:46.319
WAS POINTED OUT THAT

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:47.386
RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:50.256
OTHER STATES THAN THIS SPACE

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:52.191
WHO'VE ALREADY VENTRO. WERE

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:55.228
TRYING TO CATCH UP WE'RE TRYING

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:58.297
TO RECOGNIZE THE SOCIAL JUSTICE

01:58:58.364 --> 01:59:00.433
CHANGES NEED TO HAPPEN- AND NOT

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:04.537
JUST DURING HIGH PROFILE- ON

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:10.409
OFFICER INVOLVED- SHOOTINGS.

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:11.777
MISCONDUCT I DON'T WANT TO SAY

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:13.312
THE I THINK IT'S A FOR THE

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:16.015
RECORD. THAT ARE PROPER

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:17.283
PREPARATIONS CHAIR HAS SORT OF

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:21.087
LAID OUT SORT OF A PROCESS OF

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:23.089
HOW THIS BILL WILL BE EVALUATED

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:25.124
ON THE FISCAL FROM A FISCAL

01:59:25.191 --> 01:59:25.725
STANDPOINT I THINK THAT HELPS

01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:28.094
THE BILL. THAT THERE WILL BE

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.898
THAT TYPE OF. ANALYSIS THERE

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:33.499
WILL BE GIVEN TO IT OR TAKE IT.

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:35.101
CREATES I THINK A STRONG.

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:36.903
UNDERPINNING AS IT GOES

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:41.073
FORWARD. AND SO I JUST THINK

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:41.707
THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT AT A DEN.

01:59:41.774 --> 01:59:43.142
IF THERE'S A NEED FOR ANY

01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:44.911
ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION. OF

01:59:44.977 --> 01:59:48.180
INTENT. THAT MAY NOT BE CLEAR

01:59:48.247 --> 01:59:49.348
AS THE BILL AS CURRENTLY

01:59:49.415 --> 01:59:52.118
WRITTEN. THAT THE LETTER TO THE

01:59:52.184 --> 01:59:52.952
JOURNAL WOULD CERTAINLY

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:55.821
HOPEFULLY ALLEVIATE THAT- BUT I

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:58.558
THINK JUST. FUNDAMENTALLY THIS

01:59:58.624 --> 02:00:01.394
BILLS LIKE THIS WHEN COMMUNITY

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:04.530
LOOKS AT IT. IT'S ABOUT TRYING

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:07.700
TO REBUILD TRUST IT'S TRYING TO

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:10.536
ESTABLISH A CLEAR A LEVEL OF

02:00:10.603 --> 02:00:13.306
COMMUNICATION THAT EVERYONE

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:15.908
UNDERSTANDS AND APPRECIATES THE

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:17.743
ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:19.011
NECESSITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:00:19.078 --> 02:00:20.413
OTHER MAY CHANGE AS TIME GOES

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:22.448
ON IN TERMS OF RESPONSIBILITIES

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:23.215
OVER CERTAIN ELEMENTS I THINK

02:00:23.282 --> 02:00:25.351
THAT THERE'S- CERTAINLY OPEN

02:00:25.418 --> 02:00:27.320
CONVERSATION AND PROBABLY A

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:29.655
PLACE OF COMMONALITY. ON

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:31.324
CERTAIN FUNCTIONS THAT MAY NOT

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:33.693
BE A PART OF A POLICE WORK

02:00:33.759 --> 02:00:36.062
GOING FORWARD. BUT I ALSO LIKE

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:38.698
TO THINK. THAT THE MINIMUM

02:00:38.764 --> 02:00:42.201
WOMEN WHO GO OUT AND POLICE AND

02:00:42.268 --> 02:00:44.403
PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE.

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:46.839
THEY WANT THERE TO BE CLEARED.

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:49.175
THREE THEY WANT THERE TO BE AN

02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:50.476
OPPORTUNITY FOR TRUST TO BE

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:51.744
DEVELOPED WHY WOULD THEY WANT

02:00:51.811 --> 02:00:54.180
TO GO OUT INTO A COMMUNITY AND

02:00:54.246 --> 02:00:56.415
HAVE A US VERSUS THEM.

02:00:56.482 --> 02:00:58.918
CONFRONTATIONAL THE TIME. THERE

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.152
HAS TO BE SORT OF THIS

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:03.155
UNDERSTANDING THAT. WE'RE

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:04.490
COLLECTIVE WE ARE ALL IN THIS

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:07.960
TOGETHER. AS A SOCIETY OF A

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:10.963
HEALTHY SOCIETY. AND SO YOU

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:14.066
CANNOT EVERY. OTHER DAY TURN ON

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:16.402
THE TELEVISION AND SEE SOME

02:01:16.469 --> 02:01:18.404
TYPE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE THAT

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:21.574
LEADS TO GREAT BODILY HARM AND

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.743
DEATH TO MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC.

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:25.177
I THINK THAT THAT'S OKAY AND

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:26.879
NOT TO SUGGEST THAT ANYONE IN

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:28.748
LAW ENFORCEMENT BELIEVES THAT

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:31.050
BUT- LEVEL OF TRAINING. KNOWING

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.818
WHEN AND HOW TO ENGAGE HOW TO

02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:34.854
DE ESCALATE THESE ARE ALL VERY

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.223
IMPORTANT. COMPONENTS AND SO

02:01:37.289 --> 02:01:41.861
TRUST AND LEGISLATION LIKE THIS

02:01:41.927 --> 02:01:44.163
THAT HELPS CREATE CLARITY. SO

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:45.798
THE COMMUNITY KNOWS WHERE THE

02:01:45.865 --> 02:01:48.100
LINE IN THE SAND IS. BUT LAW

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:49.335
ENFORCEMENT KNOWS WITH A LINE

02:01:49.402 --> 02:01:51.370
IN THE SAND IS. AND THAT

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:52.405
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO START

02:01:52.471 --> 02:01:54.540
WORKING IN A MORE COLLABORATIVE

02:01:54.607 --> 02:01:57.643
WAY. BASED ON OF THESE TYPE OF

02:01:57.710 --> 02:01:59.412
LEGISLATIONS THAT WILL CREATE

02:01:59.478 --> 02:02:03.783
THAT THE CLARITY SO. I'M HAPPY

02:02:03.849 --> 02:02:05.451
TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL I'M A CO

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:09.288
AUTHOR ON THE BILL. THE CAUCUS

02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:11.023
HAS ENDORSED YOUR BILL AS YOU

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:13.159
ALREADY KNOW TO. AND I THINK

02:02:13.225 --> 02:02:16.429
YOUR BILL AS YOU'VE ALSO NOTED

02:02:16.495 --> 02:02:18.497
MAY NOT BE PERFECT. BUT IT'S

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:19.799
DESIGNED TO SORT OF MOVE THE

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:22.301
BALL DOWN THE FIELD. I'M TRYING

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:22.935
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE LARGER

02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:26.238
ISSUES THAT ARE IN OUR FACE.

02:02:26.305 --> 02:02:29.508
EVERY DAY- DEALING WITH THE

02:02:29.575 --> 02:02:32.278
CONCERNS THAT. FULL OF COLOR

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:33.713
ESPECIALLY ARE FEELING EVERY

02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:38.017
DAY. AND YOU KNOW JUST A QUICK

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:40.986
POINT I WAS A CHILD MY MOM

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:42.421
ALWAYS SAID WE WERE LITTLE THE

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:44.156
NEW ONE COULD EVER BELIEVE THAT

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:47.560
I WAS A LITTLE MORE THAT IF YOU

02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:49.628
EVER GET LOST FROM. YOU SEEK

02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:52.465
OUT THE POLICE OFFICER. YOU GO

02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:53.833
TO THAT OFFICER BECAUSE YOU'LL

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:55.801
YOU'LL BE SAFE THAT'S HOW I WAS

02:02:55.868 --> 02:02:58.504
RAISED. AND NOW YOU HAVE YOUNG

02:02:58.571 --> 02:03:03.809
PEOPLE WHO WERE SEEN RELATIVES.

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:05.311
FOR MISHANDLED BY THE POLICE

02:03:05.377 --> 02:03:08.180
THAT COULD LEAD TO DEATH. IT

02:03:08.247 --> 02:03:10.750
CAN'T BE THAT WAY. SO WHATEVER

02:03:10.816 --> 02:03:13.185
HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY. WE'VE

02:03:13.252 --> 02:03:15.121
GOT TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK AND

02:03:15.187 --> 02:03:17.556
I THINK THIS BILL HELPS SO I'M

02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:19.125
HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:22.528

THIS IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT OF

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:27.166
THE BILL FORWARD DURING THAT

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:30.002
TIME- AND WHICH WERE A QUESTION

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:31.971
A LOT ABOUT OUR SOCIETY HERE IN

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:33.539
THE STATE AROUND THE STATION

02:03:33.606 --> 02:03:35.007
AND YOU KIND OF HAD A BECAUSE I

02:03:35.074 --> 02:03:37.309
JUDICIARY AND APPROVES-

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:38.677
COMMITTEE QUESTION WHICH IS A

02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:39.678
GOOD THING BECAUSE I THINK

02:03:39.745 --> 02:03:41.413
THAT. THAT THERE ARE LAWS IN

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.682
OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY MOVE

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:46.085
FORWARD- EVEN IN THE YEARS I

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:47.820

02:03:49.555 --> 02:03:52.224
US- BUT FOR BILLS ARE PERFECT-

02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:54.260
BUT BUT THE INTENT IS

02:03:54.326 --> 02:03:55.461
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THE

02:03:55.528 --> 02:03:58.130
ABILITY. AND AT THE END OF THE

02:03:58.197 --> 02:03:59.632
BUILDING TO REMAIN OPEN AND

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.433

IS THERE A FEW SAID ONLY THAT

02:04:09.875 --> 02:04:11.744

02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:44.076
CYCLE I THINK THAT THE NEW. IS

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:45.978
GREAT. I OR ONE OF THE HAND OF

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:48.080
STATES. OF THAT DOES NOT HAVE

02:04:48.147 --> 02:04:50.850
THIS PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW AS

YOU SEE IN. THE ANTI BLACK

02:04:54.954 --> 02:04:55.521
RACISM AND VIOLENCE IS SYSTEMIC

02:04:55.588 --> 02:04:57.456
IN PLEASE SEND. THAT'S WHERE

02:04:57.523 --> 02:04:59.158
WE'RE RECOGNIZE NATIONALLY IT

POLICE OFFICERS ARE BAD IT'S A

02:05:02.661 --> 02:05:03.996
SYSTEM THAT'S A SYSTEMIC ISSUES

02:05:04.063 --> 02:05:06.198
MEANS THAT WE CAN'T. SEPARATE

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:08.267
OURSELVES FROM THAT JUST

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:08.834
BECAUSE WE'RE A GOOD OR BAD

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:12.071
PERSON- BUT OFTEN TIMES IN A

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:13.772
LONG FOR SUPPORT TICKET IS A

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:15.774
FEW BAD APPLES. WHICH IS ALSO

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.343
TRUE THERE ARE SOME FEW BAD

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:19.378
APPLES THAT THAT IF YOU EXCRETE

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:21.847
FROM THE INDUSTRY- IS GOOD FOR

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:24.416
EVERYONE INCLUDING. UP OF THE

02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:27.286
POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND SO

02:05:27.353 --> 02:05:29.455
NOBODY EVERYBODY WOULD PREFER I

02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:30.823
DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A LAWYER A

02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:32.157
DOCTOR PLEASE ALSO I WILL

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:33.626
PREFER TO PLEASE THEMSELVES.

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:34.960
NOBODY WANTS SOMEONE ELSE

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:36.495
LOOKING AT THEIR CONTACT AND

02:05:36.562 --> 02:05:37.596
SAYING YOU'RE A SPECIAL

02:05:37.663 --> 02:05:40.799
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION. YOU

02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:41.600
KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT

02:05:41.667 --> 02:05:43.202
OR SHOULD THE SOLUTION TO THAT

02:05:43.269 --> 02:05:44.303
WAY BUT THE REALITY IS

02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:47.539
NECESSARY. AND IT'S NECESSARY

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:49.241
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME HAS BEEN

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.243
NECESSARY FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:52.811
AND EVEN OVER THE PAST FEW

02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:53.746
YEARS HAS BEEN PLENTY OF

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:55.514
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:56.882
ENFORCEMENT TO STEP OF STEP

02:05:56.949 --> 02:05:58.417
FORWARD WITH THAT. SOCIAL

02:05:58.484 --> 02:05:59.919
JUSTICE ADVOCATES A BIGGER A

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:01.887
PATH AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME OUR

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.889
COMMUNITY IS DEMANDING THAT WE

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:05.190
NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

02:06:05.257 --> 02:06:08.394
BECAUSE IT'S NECESSARY. AND SO-

02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:09.795
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:06:09.862 --> 02:06:12.631
FOCUSES ON- IN ACCOUNTABILITY

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:13.799
CENTER THAT CALIFORNIA CANNOT

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:16.502
WAIT TO PAST WEEK WE NEED TO

02:06:16.568 --> 02:06:19.004
MOVE THIS FORWARD AND- AND BE

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:21.674
OPENED- AS IT GOES FORWARD- THE

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.975
TWO SUGGESTIONS OF HOW CAN BE

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:24.510
IMPROVED WHETHER IT'S NOW OR

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:26.111
NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER. WE

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.346
ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THAT WE DO

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:28.681
THAT MUCH FOR ALL OF OUR GREAT

02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.716
DEALS OF SIGNIFICANCE. AND YOU

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:31.850
KNOW TO THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:33.052
POST DURING A JUST BE

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:36.322
ADMINISTRATIVELY DONE OR- THEY

02:06:36.388 --> 02:06:37.523
PULL CHOIR THE TOSTRING OBVIOUS

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:39.258
ALSO SHOULD KNOW THAT WOULD BE

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:41.393
SERVED PROCESS AND THESE ARE

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.494
BASICS THAT ANY YOU TAKE AN

02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:50.836
JUDGE KNOW WHAT THE RULES OF.

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:52.338
THE GAME OUR BUT YOUR RIGHTS

02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:53.939
ARE AS EMPLOYEE. OF WHAT THOSE

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:55.074
ARE THOSE ARE THAT THAT. NEED

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.542
TO BE IT WILL BE DONE

02:06:56.608 --> 02:06:57.276
UNCONSCIOUS WILL BE DONE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:58.477
BECAUSE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:06:58.544 --> 02:06:59.345
THAT EVERY THAT GOES. FOR OF

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:00.479
LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE RIGHT

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:02.948
AND- ARE. BUT THAT BEING SAID

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:04.516
WE GET WE- CAN NOT WE CAN NO

02:07:04.583 --> 02:07:06.585
LONGER. HAVE OFFICERS THAT DO

02:07:06.652 --> 02:07:08.854
COMMIT EGREGIOUS ACTS. OF NOT

02:07:08.921 --> 02:07:10.222
BE ABLE JUST TO HOP AROUND FROM

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.523
DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT I

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.625
THINK THAT. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE

02:07:13.692 --> 02:07:14.760
YOU JUST OPERATE ACTUALLY EVEN

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:15.627
HEARING THAT FROM LAW

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:17.796
ENFORCEMENT AND THEY AGREE. SO

02:07:17.863 --> 02:07:18.697
I THINK IT'S GREAT A UNIQUE

02:07:18.764 --> 02:07:21.033
PERIOD OF TIME WHERE WE ARE

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:21.633
GETTING AGREEMENT FROM LONG

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.634
FORCE OF THIS IS NECESSARY.

02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:23.836
THEY MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:07:23.902 --> 02:07:24.636
VERSION OF WHAT WHAT IT MIGHT

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:25.738
LOOK LIKE FOR THEM. BUT THE

02:07:25.804 --> 02:07:27.106
FACT THAT WERE ON THE SAME

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:29.842
PAGE. IS IN ITSELF HISTORICAL.

02:07:29.908 --> 02:07:31.844
AND SIGNIFICANT AND SO FOR THAT

02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:32.845
I COMMEND YOU I COMMEND THE

02:07:32.911 --> 02:07:35.214
OPPOSITION FOR RECOGNIZING THE

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:35.914
NEED THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:38.417
SOMETHING. THAT I I'M A CO

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:39.151
AUTHOR OF THIS BILL ACTUALLY

02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:40.686
SUPPORTED AND WILL SUPPORT

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:42.921
SUBSEQUENT. OF LEGISLATION IF

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:44.723
NECESSARY TO CONTINUE TO

02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:49.795
IMPROVE UPON IT. THANK YOU SIR.

02:07:49.862 --> 02:07:51.897
THANK YOU MUST GO. THANK YOU

02:07:51.964 --> 02:07:52.765
MISTER LET ME JUST SAY AT THE

02:07:52.831 --> 02:07:54.433
OUTSET OF THE QUICK I WANT TO

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:58.871
SEE DESIRE BILL PASSED- IT'S-

02:07:58.937 --> 02:08:00.272
IT IS TIME AND WE SHOULD HAVE

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:02.041
DONE AND OTHER STATES HAVE DONE

02:08:02.107 --> 02:08:03.675
IT AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT.

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:05.611
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT A

02:08:05.677 --> 02:08:07.813
DECERTIFICATION BILL THE HOPE

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.114
THAT HOLDS PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:10.282
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:13.018
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. AND

02:08:13.085 --> 02:08:15.654
THAT THOSE WERE GIVEN POWER.

02:08:15.721 --> 02:08:16.321
AND THOSE WHO ARE GIVEN YOU

02:08:16.388 --> 02:08:18.257
KNOW MANY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:18.757
THEY THAT THEY ARE GOOD

02:08:18.824 --> 02:08:20.959
STEWARDS OF THAT. AND SO I'VE I

02:08:21.026 --> 02:08:22.194
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I AGREE

02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:24.096
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:26.131
THAT THIS IS ABOUT TRUST. RIGHT

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:28.500
IS ABOUT ESTABLISHING TRUST AND

02:08:28.567 --> 02:08:29.034
PEACE WHEN PEOPLE ARE HELD

02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:31.336
ACCOUNTABLE. THAT HOPE THAT

02:08:31.403 --> 02:08:33.038
HELPS PEOPLE TO TRUST THAT

02:08:33.105 --> 02:08:34.039
THERE IS A PROCESS THAT THERE

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:37.443
IS- THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:38.010
THOSE WHO DO WRONG FOR THOSE

02:08:38.077 --> 02:08:40.479
WHO VIOLATE. PEOPLE'S RIGHTS

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:42.581
BUT NOW IT COMES TO US WE GOT

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:45.184
TO DO THE WORK. AND THIS IS MY

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:48.320
PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A PROCESS.

02:08:48.387 --> 02:08:50.155
END OF THE PROCESS YES NO BILL

02:08:50.222 --> 02:08:53.092
IS PERFECT OF COURSE. BUT WE

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:54.693
HAVE A PROCESS THAT WE GO

02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.397
THROUGH COMMITTEES. LEVELS OF

02:08:58.464 --> 02:08:59.264
COMMITTEES THAT A BILL SHOULD

02:08:59.331 --> 02:09:00.766
GO THROUGH THAT ALLOWS

02:09:00.833 --> 02:09:02.668
STAKEHOLDER INPUT THAT WE

02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:05.237
REALLY HAVEN'T HAD. DURING THIS

02:09:05.304 --> 02:09:08.340
LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND I DO

02:09:08.407 --> 02:09:09.308
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BECAUSE

02:09:09.374 --> 02:09:10.776
HE IS SOMEONE WHO I KNOW WHO I

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:11.977
KNOW VERY WELL HAS A GREAT

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:14.246
REPUTATION FOR WORKING WITH ALL

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:15.614
SIDES AND FORGETTING THE

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:18.383
STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER- I THINK

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:19.184
THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:22.087
LANGUAGE THAT IS RIGHT NOW

02:09:22.154 --> 02:09:24.089
BEFORE US IS IT DOESN'T REFLECT.

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:24.556
ALL THOSE STAKEHOLDER

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:26.758
INTERESTS. AND I DON'T THINK

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:27.793
THAT'S ANYTHING AGAINST THE

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:29.461
AUTHOR HIMSELF IS JUST THAT WE

02:09:29.528 --> 02:09:32.498
ARE IN THE SHORT. TIME FRAME.

02:09:32.564 --> 02:09:33.765
AND THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN THE

02:09:33.832 --> 02:09:36.034
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. A LOT OF

02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:37.169
THE VETTING THAT WOULD

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:38.203
NATURALLY HAPPEN IN THIS

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:40.339
COMMITTEE AND APPROPRIATIONS

02:09:40.405 --> 02:09:43.342
COMMITTEE- IN HAVING MORE

02:09:43.408 --> 02:09:44.543
NEGOTIATIONS AND MAKING SURE

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:47.579
THAT WE DON'T MISS. CRITICAL

02:09:47.646 --> 02:09:48.147
PIECES OF THIS WE HAVE TO DO

02:09:48.213 --> 02:09:51.717
THIS RIGHT. AND SO. TO MY

02:09:51.783 --> 02:09:53.485
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

02:09:53.552 --> 02:09:55.687
WHO AYE AYE WHO I KNOW CARES

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:58.157
VERY DEEPLY ABOUT DUE PROCESS.

02:09:58.223 --> 02:09:59.224
AND WHO IN TRUTH AND THAT THAT

02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:02.261
WE ENSURE THAT. THEPROCESS

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:02.828
THAT GOES ON HERE IS IT IS A

02:10:02.895 --> 02:10:05.264
FAIR ONE. THE CLEAR LANGUAGE IN

02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:07.199
THIS BILL DOES NOT GIVE POST

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:10.402
DISCRETION. IT DOES NOT GIVE US

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:12.137
DISCRETION IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:15.774
LANGUAGE AND- THIRTEEN FIVE TEN

02:10:15.841 --> 02:10:18.043
POINT EIGHT B. THE COMMISSION

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:21.713

REGULATION A DEFINITION OF

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:23.048
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT SHALL

02:10:23.115 --> 02:10:24.716
SERVE AS THE CRITERIA TO BE

02:10:24.783 --> 02:10:26.485
CONSIDERED FOR INELIGIBILITY OR

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:29.454
REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATION

02:10:29.521 --> 02:10:32.057
THIS DEFINITION SHALL. WITHOUT

02:10:32.124 --> 02:10:34.092
LIMITATION INCLUDE ALL THE

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:36.461
FOLLOWING. WE ARE SAYING THAT

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:38.130
IT SHALL INCLUDE THE LANGUAGE

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:40.966
THAT. MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:44.136
BEAR POINTED OUT. THAT ACTS

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:46.438
THAT VIOLATE THE LAW. IT'S A

02:10:46.505 --> 02:10:49.308
VERY BROAD STANDARD MUST BE

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:51.510
INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION.

02:10:51.577 --> 02:10:51.977
THAT DOESN'T GET POST

02:10:52.044 --> 02:10:54.980
DISCRETION. IT SAYS YOU SHALL

02:10:55.047 --> 02:10:56.848
HAVE THIS IN YOUR DEFINITION

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:58.684
THAT'S A VERY BROAD WAY TO

02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:59.318
DESCRIBE IT AND SO I THINK AT A

02:10:59.384 --> 02:11:02.321
VERY MINIMUM. EACH WE NEED TO

02:11:02.387 --> 02:11:04.089
ELIMINATE THAT SECTION. BECAUSE

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.357
THE OTHER SECTIONS VERY CLEARLY

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.159
POINTED OUT THAT THE GETS OUT

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:07.759
EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:11:07.826 --> 02:11:10.862
ABOUT. AND I'LL JUST GO THROUGH

02:11:10.929 --> 02:11:11.730
THE REALLY QUICKLY ACTS OF

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:14.266
DISHONESTY MISREPORTING ACTION

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:15.901
ABUSE OF POWER.ACTS OF

02:11:15.968 --> 02:11:19.905
PHYSICAL ABUSE SEXUAL ASSAULT.

02:11:19.972 --> 02:11:21.607
BIAS THOUGH THOSE ARE ALL IN

02:11:21.673 --> 02:11:23.275
THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE WANT TO

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:24.943
ENSURE THAT THIS PERSON. AT

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:27.779
THIS OFFICER WHO WHO HAS BEEN

02:11:27.846 --> 02:11:28.547
FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED THESE

02:11:28.614 --> 02:11:30.616
THINGS IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO ON

02:11:30.682 --> 02:11:31.717
TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT BUT THEN

02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:33.385
WHEN YOU ADD THIS SECTION SAYS.

02:11:33.452 --> 02:11:34.920
ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE ALONG WITH

02:11:34.987 --> 02:11:36.421
THAT THAT INCLUDES A WHOLE HOST

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:38.190
OF THINGS MANY THINGS ARE

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:39.524
VIOLATIONS OF LAW BUT DO THEY

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:40.959
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF AN ABUSE

02:11:41.026 --> 02:11:43.829
OF POWER. MISCONDUCT THAT

02:11:43.895 --> 02:11:44.796
WARRANTS TAKING SOMEONE'S

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:47.299
LIVELIHOOD AWAY BECAUSE THAT'S

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:48.367
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

02:11:48.433 --> 02:11:49.334
TALKING ABOUT SAYING THAT THIS

02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:50.369
PERSON COULD NEVER WORK IN LAW

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:52.904
ENFORCEMENT AGAIN. SO THAT'S A

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:54.940
PROBLEM WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:57.542
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.

02:11:57.609 --> 02:11:58.744
IT'S NOT TO THE LETTER TO THE

02:11:58.810 --> 02:12:00.312
JOURNAL IT'S DO AMEND IN THE

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:01.680
BILL AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:03.749
LANGUAGE IS VERY CLEAR. AND WE

02:12:03.815 --> 02:12:06.285
DON'T HAVE THIS. YOU KNOW BROAD

02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:07.486
DEFINITION AND THE LANGUAGE SO

02:12:07.552 --> 02:12:08.920
I THINK IT A VERY MINIMAL NEED

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:09.955
TO CHANGE THAT TO MAKE THIS A

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:12.524
BETTER BILL. TO ENSURE THAT IT

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:13.825
HAS THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE

02:12:13.892 --> 02:12:14.426
TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER STATES

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:15.894
THAT HAVE PASSED.

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:17.195
DECERTIFICATION THE OTHER KEY

02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:20.165
THING. IT'S NOT IN HERE IS

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:21.767
POPOLARE POPOLARE IS COMPLETELY

02:12:21.833 --> 02:12:24.469
MISSING. FROM THE COMMISSION

02:12:24.536 --> 02:12:27.072
REVIEW IT'S NOT IN THERE. YOU

02:12:27.139 --> 02:12:28.740
WOULD HAVE THAT AT THE AGENCY

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:30.909
LEVEL AT THE LOCAL AGENCY LEVEL

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:33.378
YES BUT UNDER THE CLEAR TERMS

02:12:33.445 --> 02:12:35.814
OF THIS LANGUAGE. UNDER THE

02:12:35.881 --> 02:12:37.549
COMMISSION REVIEW ALL IT TAKES

02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:39.418
IS SOMEONE TO MAKE A COMPLAINT

02:12:39.484 --> 02:12:40.752
AND THE COMMISSION GOES THROUGH

02:12:40.819 --> 02:12:43.021
A MAKES A FINDING. OF OUR

02:12:43.088 --> 02:12:44.356
PROTECTIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:47.125
HERE. AND EVERY OTHER STATE

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:47.726
THOSE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.895
ARE THERE. SO WHY SHOULDN'T WE

02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:51.763
ENSURE THAT THAT IS IN THIS.

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:52.898
SAME THING AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:12:52.964 --> 02:12:55.701
SAN DIEGO POINTED OUT AS IT IS

02:12:55.767 --> 02:12:57.769
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO

02:12:57.836 --> 02:13:00.038
HAVE THAT IN THE LANGUAGE AND

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:00.605
IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WOULD

02:13:00.672 --> 02:13:03.041
GET CAUGHT IF WE WERE GOING TO.

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:06.878
OUR NORMAL PROCESS- AND

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.280
ENSURING THAT AN APPEALS

02:13:08.347 --> 02:13:10.182
PROCESS IS A FAIR AND UNBIASED

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:11.850
I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE

02:13:11.917 --> 02:13:12.351
NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHEN

02:13:12.417 --> 02:13:16.788
SOMEONE IS. SUBJECT TO A REVIEW.

02:13:16.855 --> 02:13:17.856
THAT WE ENSURE THAT'S A FIR

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:20.025
AND UNBIASED PROCESS AND I

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:21.593
THINK THE WAY THAT THIS THE

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:24.196
BOARD IS COMPOSED- AND THE LACK

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:26.665
OF DUE PROCESS MEANS THAT THIS

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:27.532
WILL PROBABLY NOT BE A VERY

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:29.301
FAIR PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO GO

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:30.402
THROUGH I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:32.504
VERY MINIMAL ENSURE THAT THAT

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:36.608
IS THE CASE. YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:37.909
OTHER ISSUES THAT I THINK WE

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:39.811
GET INTO BUT YOU KNOW AS A

02:13:39.878 --> 02:13:41.813
CHAIR OF A PROBE SADISTIC IT IS

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:44.216
EXPENSIVE WE SHOULD BE IS

02:13:44.282 --> 02:13:44.816
ASSERTING MAKE IT WHAT IS THE

02:13:44.883 --> 02:13:47.519
COST. WE HAVEN'T EVEN SET THE

02:13:47.586 --> 02:13:50.555
FIA. I MEAN SO THAT'S WE GOT

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:53.525
FOUR DAYS HERE AND I KNOW

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:54.092
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THINGS

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:55.827
THAT HAPPEN THIS YEAR. BUT

02:13:55.894 --> 02:13:56.361
MAYBE THAT'S JUST ANOTHER

02:13:56.428 --> 02:13:59.030
REASON FOR US TO LIKE. REALLY

02:13:59.097 --> 02:13:59.631
DELVE INTO THIS AND MAKE SURE

02:13:59.698 --> 02:14:02.567
WE GET IT RIGHT. OR DON'T JUST

02:14:02.634 --> 02:14:03.135
PASS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:05.904
HAVE. ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

02:14:05.971 --> 02:14:08.673
SEEN B. AND OTHER PARTS AND

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:09.775
OTHER STATES WHERE THEY'VE DONE

02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:11.877
SIMILAR THINGS RIGHT. YOU KNOW

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:12.944
JUST PASS SOMETHING AND SAY

02:14:13.011 --> 02:14:15.213
OKAY WE'LL TRY AND FIX IT LATER

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:15.747
WILL PUT A LETTER IN THE

02:14:15.814 --> 02:14:16.281
JOURNAL IF YOU KNOW THAT

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:17.816
THERE'S A PROBLEM. LET'S FIX IT

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:21.353
NOW. AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:22.120
THE BEST CALL. PRODUCT IT

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:27.025
ENSURES JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS.

02:14:27.092 --> 02:14:28.827
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECT OF

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:31.062
ABUSE AND WE DON'T HAVE.

02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:33.465
OFFICERS AS YOU SAID AND WE

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:34.332
DON'T HAVE THIS IS BETTER FOR

02:14:34.399 --> 02:14:35.667
EVERYONE IS BETTER FOR A LONG

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:37.269
FORCES BETTER FOR THE PUBLIC

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:38.003
THAT WE DON'T HAVE LAW

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:40.572
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO ARE

02:14:40.639 --> 02:14:42.307
ALLOWED TO GO TO OTHER AGENCIES

02:14:42.374 --> 02:14:45.210
WHEN THEY HAVE COMMITTED GROSS

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:49.548
ACTS OF ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT.

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:51.049
AND IT ALSO PROTECTS AS YOU

02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:55.220
SAID. LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:57.222
NEWS NEWS THEY WANT TO BE

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:59.624
ASSOCIATED WITH. THOSE WHO ARE

02:14:59.691 --> 02:15:02.127
COMMITTING SUCH ACTS. BUT WE

02:15:02.194 --> 02:15:03.528
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET

02:15:03.595 --> 02:15:04.896
THIS RIGHT AND BUT YOU KNOW

02:15:04.963 --> 02:15:06.364
RUSSIAN HEARING RUSSIAN

02:15:06.431 --> 02:15:08.767
WITNESSES NOT FOLLOWING OUR

02:15:08.834 --> 02:15:11.803
RULES AND TRYING TO PUSH THIS

02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:12.971
THING THROUGH IN THE LAST DAYS

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:15.040
OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO ME IS

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:16.541
NOT A VERY GOOD PROCESS I THINK

02:15:16.608 --> 02:15:19.077
WE CAN SAY THAT. THANK YOU TO

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:20.212
OF THE BILL THAT WE CAN ALL

02:15:20.278 --> 02:15:21.780
SUPPORT AND TO BE VERY

02:15:21.847 --> 02:15:23.415
BIPARTISAN AND IT WOULD BE IS.

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:24.716
A BILL THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR

02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:26.852
ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT IT'S NOT

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:27.752
IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE THAT WE

02:15:27.819 --> 02:15:29.821
GOT THE FORCE AND SO WHAT I

02:15:29.888 --> 02:15:31.356
WOULD REALLY ASK IS IT CAN WE-

02:15:31.423 --> 02:15:33.124
CAN WE ENSURE THAT AT LEAST

02:15:33.191 --> 02:15:33.758
THOSE TWO THINGS GET TAKEN CARE

02:15:33.825 --> 02:15:36.228
OF. I MEAN WITH THE AUTHOR

02:15:36.294 --> 02:15:38.563
MAYBE COMMIT TO CHANGING THOSE

02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:41.800
THINGS THE PROBAR ISSUE. AND

02:15:41.867 --> 02:15:43.768
THE BROAD DEFINITION OF ACTS

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:46.538
THAT VIOLATE THE LAW. I THINK

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:47.839
THOSE WOULD BE TWO IS THAT

02:15:47.906 --> 02:15:49.241
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK ON

02:15:49.307 --> 02:15:50.075
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

02:15:50.141 --> 02:15:51.943
TIME. AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE

02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:54.412
CHANGES BEFORE THIS THING COMES

02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:56.848
TO A VOTE BEFORE THE FULL BODY.

02:15:56.915 --> 02:16:00.085
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT.

02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:02.254
IN MY IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD GO

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.256
THROUGH THE NATURAL POCESS AND

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:05.357
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND

02:16:05.423 --> 02:16:07.125
COMMITTEE PROCESS THAT WE

02:16:07.192 --> 02:16:10.962
NORMALLY GO THROUGH. SO TO THE

02:16:11.029 --> 02:16:13.098
AUTHOR I MEAN COULD YOU MAYBE

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:17.402
ADDRESS. THOSE TWO ISSUES AS-

02:16:17.469 --> 02:16:19.304
AS THIS GOES FORWARD I MEAN

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:21.373
WE'VE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES TO

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:23.275
GET TO THIS POINT TODAY IT'S

02:16:23.341 --> 02:16:25.143
NOT LIKE A FULL BAR HASN'T BEEN

02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:27.979
DISCUSSED IT IS NOT LIKE THE

02:16:28.046 --> 02:16:30.048
EXPANSION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A

02:16:30.115 --> 02:16:31.850
VIOLATION OR DECERTIFICATION

02:16:31.917 --> 02:16:33.919
HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED AND WE

02:16:33.985 --> 02:16:36.121
SPLIT THE BABY AND THE HAIR AS

02:16:36.187 --> 02:16:38.189
MANY WAYS AS WE CAN AND EVERY

02:16:38.256 --> 02:16:39.558
TIME WE WENT TO THE EXTREME

02:16:39.624 --> 02:16:41.760
LEFT WE GOT PUSHBACK FROM ONCE

02:16:41.826 --> 02:16:43.695
I WANT TO STREAM RIGHT WE GOT

02:16:43.762 --> 02:16:44.362
PUSHED BACK TO THAT. THIS IS

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:46.965
THE WHAT WE FELT WAS UP THE

02:16:47.032 --> 02:16:49.734
METAL BACK PANEL LIKE DREADED

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:52.671
THIRTY TO BEST TO BRING. MOST

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:53.672
PEOPLE TOGETHER IS THIS A

02:16:53.738 --> 02:16:55.073
PERFECT BILL BY NO STRETCH OF

02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:57.242
IMAGINATION. BUT IS A GOOD BILL

02:16:57.309 --> 02:17:00.011
IT'S A GOOD BILL AND IT'S MORE

02:17:00.078 --> 02:17:00.812
THAN WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:03.214
AND IT'S- WORTH FIGHTING FOR

02:17:03.281 --> 02:17:04.783
RIGHT NOW. ALL THOSE

02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:06.284
DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU'VE RAISED

02:17:06.351 --> 02:17:07.752
BOTH IN SUPPORT OF OPPOSITION

02:17:07.819 --> 02:17:09.621
WILL CONTINUE TO GO ON ALL OVER

02:17:40.819 --> 02:17:43.121
NOT IN THIS LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW

02:17:43.188 --> 02:17:45.690
PROBAR NOT IN THIS LANGUAGE.

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:47.759
THE DEFINITION VERY CLEARLY

02:17:47.826 --> 02:17:51.396
DOESN'T GIVE POST DISCRETION

02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:51.963
AND HAS IS VERY BROAD

02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:53.698
DEFINITION. THAT'S IN THE

02:17:53.765 --> 02:17:55.900
LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S

02:17:55.967 --> 02:17:59.237
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO VOTE. SO

02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:00.305
UNLESS THAT IS ACTUALLY

02:18:00.372 --> 02:18:01.873
CHANGING THE LANGUAGE I CAN'T

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:03.008
GET TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:04.109
SUPPORT IT AND HERE'S THE THING

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:06.177
I WANT TO READ I WANT TO BE

02:18:06.244 --> 02:18:07.412
SUPPORTIVE OF A GOOD FOR

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:09.447
DECERTIFICATION BILL THAT

02:18:09.514 --> 02:18:11.282
ACCOMPLISHES THE OBJECTIVES

02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:14.352
THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON.

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:15.920
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CHANGE

02:18:15.987 --> 02:18:17.389
WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB OF

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:19.924
LEGISLATING BY MAKING SURE THAT

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:22.827

02:18:30.902 --> 02:18:32.270

REALLY MORE ONE SIDES LANGUAGE.

02:18:34.272 --> 02:18:36.474
I WOULD SAY IT'S MORE ACLU

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:39.978
LANGUAGE. THEN IT IS THE RESULT

02:18:40.045 --> 02:18:42.313
OF A PROCESS WHERE ALL THE

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:44.482
STAKEHOLDERS ARE TALKING ABOUT

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:45.050

A GOOD EXAMPLE WE TALKED ABOUT

02:22:22.901 --> 02:22:24.235
TICKETS I DON'T THINK ANYONE UP

02:22:24.302 --> 02:22:26.938
HERE WOULD SUPPORT THE NOTION

02:22:27.005 --> 02:22:28.907
THAT IF AN OFFICER. GETS A

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:30.041
MOVING VIOLATION AND THAT

02:22:30.108 --> 02:22:31.009
THAT'S GOING TO RISE TO THE

02:22:31.075 --> 02:22:33.578
REVIEW AND I POST IS NOT GOING

02:22:33.645 --> 02:22:37.282
TO DO THAT HOWEVER. A AT SOME

02:22:37.348 --> 02:22:40.285
POINT I COULD SEE. ANOTHER

02:22:40.351 --> 02:22:42.520
TRAFFIC VIOLATION BEING

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:44.789
EVIDENCE OF A BLATANT DISREGARD

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:46.524
FOR THE LAW THE POST MIGHT WANT

02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:49.260
TO LOOK AT. SO IF WE'RE NOT

02:22:49.327 --> 02:22:51.562
CAREFUL AND IF WE'RE AND IF WE

02:22:51.629 --> 02:22:53.831
EXEMPT THIS EXEMPT THAT FROM

02:22:53.898 --> 02:22:56.234
POST ABILITY TO LOOK. WE

02:22:56.301 --> 02:22:58.269
POTENTIALLY ALLOW SOMEONE WITH

02:22:58.336 --> 02:23:00.772
A BLATANT DISREGARD OF THE LAW

02:23:00.838 --> 02:23:02.073
TO CONTINUE TO BE CERTIFIED AS

02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:04.175
A POLICE OFFICER. I DON'T WANT

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:05.944
I DON'T WANT TO SET UP A

02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:06.577
SITUATION WHERE WE ARE CREATING

02:23:06.644 --> 02:23:08.613
THAT. AND YOUR BILL DOESN'T DO

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:10.848
THAT YOUR BILL ALLOWS POST TO

02:23:10.915 --> 02:23:13.151
CREATE ADEQUATE REGULATIONS IF

02:23:13.217 --> 02:23:15.420
THEY DON'T THEN THAT'S UP TO US

02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:17.088
TO GO BACK IN IN. THE

02:23:17.155 --> 02:23:19.424
SEPARATION OF POWERS AND FIX

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.759
WHAT WE THINK THEY DID WRONG.

02:23:21.826 --> 02:23:23.094
SO THAT IS WHY I THINK THIS IS

02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:24.362
A GOOD BILL IT ABSOLUTELY MEETS

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:25.697
OUR STANDARDS THIS IS NOT

02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:27.098
NECESSARILY A BILL THAT WOULD

02:23:27.165 --> 02:23:28.433
HAVE COME TO US AND UNDER OTHER

02:23:28.499 --> 02:23:30.735
CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT IT'S BEFORE

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:32.904
US AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OF

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:34.472
ANALYZE IT WHICH WE HAVE DONE

02:23:34.539 --> 02:23:35.506
AND THE TOM CLARK DID AN

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:36.908
EXCELLENT JOB OF TRYING TO WORK

02:23:36.975 --> 02:23:37.875
WITH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:39.944
YOU AT A LATER DATE. WORKING

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:40.945
WITH OUR COMMITTEE TO MAKE

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:43.648
SURE. THAT BUT OUR QUESTIONS

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:46.184
ANSWERED AND- AND THIS IS A OF

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:47.585
I WAS I'M A CO AUTHOR WHICH I

02:23:47.652 --> 02:23:48.753
DON'T NORMALLY DO WITH THOSE

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:49.787
THAT COME TO THE COMMITTEE BUT

02:23:49.854 --> 02:23:51.956
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. FOR

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:54.325
CALIFORNIA TO BE DOING RIGHT

02:23:54.392 --> 02:23:55.793
NOW. THAT I WAS HAPPY TO BE A

02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:57.762
CO AUTHOR AND I AM. REALLY

02:23:57.829 --> 02:23:58.863
PROUD OF THE STATE THIS BILL IS

02:23:58.930 --> 02:24:00.932
IN. AS IT MOVES OUT OF

02:24:00.999 --> 02:24:02.567
COMMITTEE AND PROUD OF THE WORK

02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:03.901
THAT YOU'VE DONE I KNOW IT'S

02:24:03.968 --> 02:24:04.702
BEEN A LONG ROAD AND

02:24:04.769 --> 02:24:06.838
FRUSTRATING ROAD. BUT I THINK

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:08.573
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:24:08.639 --> 02:24:11.242
MOVE THIS THIS BILL ALONG AT

02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:13.478
THIS POINT AND OF COURSE WE

02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:15.279
WILL STAY ENGAGED AS NECESSARY.

02:24:15.346 --> 02:24:17.215
BECAUSE THESE LAWS DO HAVE I

02:24:17.281 --> 02:24:19.717
NEED TO BE. TO HAVE OVERSIGHT

02:24:19.784 --> 02:24:22.887
AND HAVE. THE LEGISLATURE

02:24:22.954 --> 02:24:24.555
MAKING SURE THAT AS IT GETS

02:25:53.644 --> 02:25:55.179
PERSONALLY AS I STATED IN MY

02:25:55.246 --> 02:25:56.514
OPENING BUT I SHOULD HEAR THE

02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:59.517
GUY WHO'S CLOSE TO BEING A

02:25:59.584 --> 02:26:00.585
POLICE OFFICER. I WAS THIS

02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:01.886
CLOSE TO BECOMING A POLICE

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:04.922
OFFICER. I WAS RECRUITED BY A

02:26:04.989 --> 02:26:06.190
GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO JUST

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:07.859
RETIRED FROM THIRTY FIVE YEARS

02:26:07.925 --> 02:26:10.294
VALLEY PD. HE SAT BY MY SIDE

02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:11.762
AND HE'S HOLD MY HAND ON EVERY

02:26:11.829 --> 02:26:14.265
BIT OF THIS BILL. THE MAKE SURE

02:26:14.332 --> 02:26:16.968
WE GOT IT RIGHT. BECAUSE HE IS

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:18.436
PROUD OF THIS THIRTY FIVE YEARS

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:20.938
OF A POLICE OFFICER. IN AT

02:26:21.005 --> 02:26:21.973
THIRTY FIVE YEARS HE HAS NEVER

02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:25.510
ONCE FIRED HIS WEAPON. AND HE

02:26:25.576 --> 02:26:27.845

THEIR WAY TO THE PARK HAD NEVER

02:26:38.456 --> 02:26:40.558
TO BE FAR. A BAD APPLE WHO

02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:43.361

TOO ASHAMED TO REPORT IT

BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT NO ONE

02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:54.038

BACK THOSE FIVE YEARS. AND

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:44.795
REVIEW THOSE APPLICANTS AND IF

02:31:44.862 --> 02:31:47.631
THEY HAD MADE THAT CUT. WHICH

02:31:47.698 --> 02:31:48.599
SEEMS TO BE ADEQUATE NOW FOR

02:31:48.666 --> 02:31:50.501
MOVING FORWARD. WHY NOT FOR

02:31:50.568 --> 02:31:51.735
THOSE ATTORNEYS AND THAT WOULD

02:31:51.802 --> 02:31:53.003
BRING MORE TURNING INTO

02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:54.839
CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WHERE WE

02:31:54.905 --> 02:31:56.340
REALLY NEED THEM. TO MORE

02:31:56.407 --> 02:31:57.641
TURKEYS WE'VE HAD CALIFORNIA

02:31:57.708 --> 02:32:00.277

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:01.545
ACCEPTING RECIPROCITY FROM

02:32:03.347 --> 02:32:05.015
HIGH A STANDARD. ON THE NOTION

02:32:05.082 --> 02:32:06.650
THAT THAT THAT THAT PROTECTS

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.285
THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT MAKES A

02:32:08.352 --> 02:32:10.154
HIGHER STAND FOR ATTORNEYS.

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:12.289
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY TRUE. AND

02:32:12.356 --> 02:32:14.425
THE BARS ROLE IS TO LOOK AT THE

02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:16.126
PRACTICE OF TOURNEY'S ONCE THEY

02:32:16.193 --> 02:32:17.895

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:19.597
THE BAD ACTORS THAT'S WHAT

02:32:19.663 --> 02:32:20.965
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND- AND

02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:22.500
I SAID IT TOO HIGH OF A BAR

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:27.304
OF LAW. THEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:32:27.371 --> 02:32:28.906
WEEDING OUT FOLKS WHO WOULD BE

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:30.975
GOOD ATTORNEYS NOT NECESSARILY

02:32:31.041 --> 02:32:32.643
SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE SOME OF

02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:35.012
THE BAR DOES THEIR JOB. BUT

02:32:35.079 --> 02:32:37.014

02:58:46.582 --> 02:58:47.616
GENERAL OF THE STATE OF

02:58:47.683 --> 02:58:48.551
CALIFORNIA THESE ARE ALL

02:58:48.617 --> 02:58:51.654
INDIVIDUALS WHO FAILED THE BAR.

02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:53.322
REDUCING A CUT SCORE SO THAT

02:58:53.389 --> 02:58:54.190
WERE STILL ONE OF THE TOP IN

02:58:54.256 --> 02:58:57.993
THE COUNTRY. WE NEED TO DO THIS.

02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:00.162
WITH DATA RECORDER HONEST ON

02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:02.731

THE MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MR

STERN SO I THIS IS A YEAH I

02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:09.038
THINK PRESENTS AN INTERESTING

02:59:09.105 --> 02:59:11.040
ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND- I THINK

02:59:11.107 --> 02:59:11.807
WHAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING HERE

02:59:11.874 --> 02:59:13.109
GOES AGAINST NOT ONLY WHAT OUR

02:59:13.175 --> 02:59:15.177
SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED THAT

02:59:15.244 --> 02:59:16.245
ALSO WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED

02:59:16.312 --> 02:59:19.248
FOR. ANY STATE IS CHANGED ITS

02:59:19.315 --> 02:59:21.884
IT SCORE AND- I SORT OF I SEE I

02:59:21.951 --> 02:59:23.385
SEE THE ARGUMENT THAT IT'S

02:59:23.452 --> 02:59:24.653
SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY THAT IF YOU

02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:26.288
TOOK THE BAR LAST YEAR THEN

02:59:26.355 --> 02:59:27.690
YOU'RE HELD TO A MUCH HIGHER

02:59:27.756 --> 02:59:28.257
STANDARD THAN IF YOU TOOK IT

02:59:28.324 --> 02:59:30.059
THIS YEAR BUT- IT WOULD SEEM IS

02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:31.861
EQUALLY ARBITRARY THAT. IF YOU

02:59:31.927 --> 02:59:33.429
TOOK THE BAR SIX YEARS AGO THEN

02:59:33.496 --> 02:59:35.931
YOU'RE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER CUTS

02:59:35.998 --> 02:59:36.499
FOR THAT IF YOU TOOK A FIVE

02:59:36.565 --> 02:59:40.669
YEARS AGO AND SO I GUESS MY

02:59:40.736 --> 02:59:41.470
QUESTION IS. HOW DO YOU. WHAT

02:59:41.537 --> 02:59:42.171
WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT. FOR

02:59:42.238 --> 02:59:43.372
GUIDING WHAT'S FAIR HERE

02:59:43.439 --> 02:59:45.074
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME. WHAT

02:59:45.141 --> 02:59:46.675
THE FAIREST THING MIGHT BE. IS

02:59:46.742 --> 02:59:48.644
SIMPLY FOR FOLKS THAT. IS TO

02:59:48.711 --> 02:59:50.279
RESPECT THE EXPECTATIONS OF

02:59:50.346 --> 02:59:51.380
PEOPLE WHEN THEY MADE THE

02:59:51.447 --> 02:59:52.982
DECISION TO TAKE THE BAR SO FOR

02:59:53.048 --> 02:59:54.183
FOLKS WHO TOOK THE BAR WHEN IT

02:59:54.250 --> 02:59:55.951
WAS THE OLD CUT SCORE THERE

02:59:56.018 --> 02:59:56.552
SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT CUTS

02:59:56.619 --> 02:59:57.887
ARE. GONNA MAKE THE DECISION TO

02:59:57.953 --> 02:59:59.622
TAKE THE BAR NOW. WITH THE NEW

02:59:59.688 --> 03:00:00.523
CUTS FOR THE SHOULD BE CUT

03:00:00.589 --> 03:00:02.158
SUBJECT ABOUT WHY IS THAT. WHY

03:00:02.224 --> 03:00:03.759
IS THERE A BETTER CRITERIA FOR

03:00:03.826 --> 03:00:05.528
FAIRNESS THAN THAT. WELL THANK

03:00:05.594 --> 03:00:07.229
YOU AND YEAH I WILL POINT OUT I

03:00:07.296 --> 03:00:09.565
DID MISS. SPEAK THERE I HAVE

03:00:09.632 --> 03:00:10.332
ASKED THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE

03:00:10.399 --> 03:00:12.234
ASKED FOR. REGIONALLY FOR THIS

03:00:12.301 --> 03:00:14.436
RECORD. TO GO BACK FIVE YEARS

03:00:14.503 --> 03:00:16.038
WITH THIS RESOLUTION ASKS IS.

03:00:16.105 --> 03:00:17.540
UP TO FIVE YEARS BECAUSE I

03:00:17.606 --> 03:00:19.675
WASN'T SURE. THAT IS WHAT I

03:00:19.742 --> 03:00:21.243
WANT YOUR VOTES ON THIS END AND

03:00:21.310 --> 03:00:22.044
I WASN'T SURE THAT WOULD BE

03:00:22.111 --> 03:00:23.712
SATISFACTORY. THE REASON TO GO

03:00:23.779 --> 03:00:27.683
BACK. FIVE YEARS IS THAT'S

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:28.617
ESSENTIALLY HOW LONG. THE REST

03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:30.352
OF THAT BAR. EXAM ARE. OUR

03:00:30.419 --> 03:00:32.688
VALUE GO BACK MUCH BEYOND THAT.

03:00:32.755 --> 03:00:34.623
THERE MAY NOT BE THE RECORD.

03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:37.226
AND THE SUPREME COURT COULD HE-

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:38.994
CAN'T DO THAT CAN GO BACK FIVE

03:00:39.061 --> 03:00:40.362
YEARS IT TAKE THOSE. THOSE

03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:42.331
APPLICANTS THAT THAT'S WHY. THE

03:00:42.398 --> 03:00:43.866
FIVE YEARS. AND MY QUESTION

03:00:43.933 --> 03:00:46.835
WHAT WHEN WE LOOK AT. AFFAIRS

03:00:46.902 --> 03:00:49.872
QUESTION. IF THIRTEEN NINETY IS

03:00:49.939 --> 03:00:52.241
VALID GOING FORWARD. WHY WASN'T

03:00:52.308 --> 03:00:53.842
IT BALLOT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN

03:00:53.909 --> 03:00:55.411
SENSE THAT FOR UP TO FIVE

03:00:55.477 --> 03:00:57.279
YEARS. IS A REASONABLE HORIZON

03:00:57.346 --> 03:00:59.548
TO LOOK AT I AGREE WITH YOU.

03:00:59.615 --> 03:01:02.484
SIX YEARS AGO. TEN YEARS AGO.

03:01:02.551 --> 03:01:05.521
WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN VALID YES

03:01:05.588 --> 03:01:06.655
BUT BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE

03:01:06.722 --> 03:01:08.991
TO CUT OFF LOWER THAN THIRTEEN

03:01:09.058 --> 03:01:10.159
NINETY I DON'T KNOW WE SAID ON

03:01:10.226 --> 03:01:11.227
THIRTEEN NINETY BECAUSE OF WHAT

03:01:11.293 --> 03:01:13.095
OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. AND

03:01:13.162 --> 03:01:14.763
HOURS AT FOURTEEN FORTY WAS

03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:16.699
JUST ARBITRARILY HIGH NEVER

03:01:16.765 --> 03:01:19.034
JUSTIFIED. THE QUESTION CAME UP

03:01:19.101 --> 03:01:20.202
ABOUT THE VALIDITY THE BAR EXAM

03:01:20.269 --> 03:01:22.638
ITSELF IS THAT THE MOST

03:01:22.705 --> 03:01:24.340
APPROPRIATE MEASURE. MY

03:01:24.406 --> 03:01:26.008
PERSONAL OPINION NO I WOULD

03:01:26.075 --> 03:01:27.509
RATHER THAT WE SEE MULTIPLE

03:01:27.576 --> 03:01:29.345
MEASURES OF BRINGING PEOPLE

03:01:29.411 --> 03:01:31.413
INTO THE PRACTICE OF LAW. SO

03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:32.681
EVEN IF WE SAID NOW IT'S BEEN

03:01:32.748 --> 03:01:34.617
SAID AT THIRTEEN NINETY WHAT IF

03:01:34.683 --> 03:01:35.517
SOMEBODY DID THIRTEEN EIGHTY

03:01:35.584 --> 03:01:37.519
NOT YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT

03:01:37.586 --> 03:01:39.688
FOR THAT. YES THAT'S TRUE BUT

03:01:39.755 --> 03:01:41.790
IT NEEDS TO BE SET SOMEWHERE

03:01:41.857 --> 03:01:42.992
SINCE THE SUPREME COURT HAS

03:01:43.058 --> 03:01:45.094
TAKEN IT TO THIRTEEN NINETY NOW

03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:46.996
WHICH IS GOOD WE- I SUPPORT

03:01:47.062 --> 03:01:49.632
THAT AND- ASK FOR THAT NUMBER

03:01:49.698 --> 03:01:52.067
WAS THE BEST FOR THAT. BUT IT'S

03:01:52.134 --> 03:01:53.802
AGAIN ARBITRARY THAT IF YOU

03:01:53.869 --> 03:01:55.070
TOOK IT IN FEBRUARY OF LAST

03:01:55.137 --> 03:01:56.572
YEAR OR LAST YEAR OR THE

03:01:56.639 --> 03:01:58.107
PREVIOUS YEAR OR DURING THAT

03:01:58.173 --> 03:01:59.642
FIVE YEAR PERIOD. WHERE THE

03:01:59.708 --> 03:02:01.377
RECORD SHOULD EXIST AND THIS

03:02:01.443 --> 03:02:02.911
REPORT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

03:02:02.978 --> 03:02:04.880
WELCOME THOSE. APPLICANTS INTO

03:02:04.947 --> 03:02:06.782
THE BAR I WOULDN'T ONLY.

03:02:06.849 --> 03:02:09.184
BECAUSE THE NEED IS NOW. AND

03:02:09.251 --> 03:02:10.986
THE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED

03:02:11.053 --> 03:02:13.022
SCRIPTORIA FACT OF THAT HIGH

03:02:13.088 --> 03:02:14.723
CUT SCORE WE WOULD HAVE THE

03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:16.792
OPPORTUNITY OF WELCOMING MORE

03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:18.460
TURKEYS INTO THE PRACTICE. AT A

03:02:18.527 --> 03:02:20.863
TIME IS MR TWO POINTS OUT WE

03:02:20.929 --> 03:02:23.899
NEED THEM WE NEED THEM NOW I

03:02:23.966 --> 03:02:25.134
THINK WE'VE BEEN OVERLY.

03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:26.869
CAUTIOUS ABOUT WELCOMING PEOPLE

03:02:26.935 --> 03:02:28.804
IS WHAT WE HAVE AT OUR I WANT

03:02:28.871 --> 03:02:29.705
THIS RECORD TO LOOK AT

03:02:29.772 --> 03:02:32.007
RECIPROCITY. AS WELL. IF YOU

03:02:32.074 --> 03:02:33.275
CAN IF YOU'RE PASSED THE BAR IN

03:02:33.342 --> 03:02:35.511
ANOTHER STATE. WHY ARE WE SO

03:02:35.577 --> 03:02:36.979
HIGH AND MIGHTY THAT YOU CAN'T

03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:39.782
PRACTICE HERE. NOW MAYBE THERE

03:02:39.848 --> 03:02:42.451
ARE OTHER STATES WITH TOO LOW

03:02:42.518 --> 03:02:43.018
THE STANDARD I DON'T I DON'T

03:02:43.085 --> 03:02:43.686
WANT TO GET INTO THAT BUT THERE

03:02:43.752 --> 03:02:44.687
ARE PLENTY OF OTHER STATES WITH

03:02:44.753 --> 03:02:46.422
A HIGH ENOUGH STANDARDS. THAT I

03:02:46.488 --> 03:02:48.791
KNOW THEY WOULD BE COMPETENT

03:02:48.857 --> 03:02:51.560
EFFECTIVE ATTORNEYS THAT AND

03:02:51.627 --> 03:02:52.861
MOST OF PEOPLE CALLED IT. I

03:02:52.928 --> 03:02:54.930
WOULD WELCOME THEM. INTO THE

03:02:54.997 --> 03:02:56.532
BAR THOSE APPLICANTS. AT THIS

03:02:56.598 --> 03:02:58.033
LEVEL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE

03:02:58.100 --> 03:02:59.768
SURE THAT WE'RE CHANGING. THE

03:02:59.835 --> 03:03:01.136
DEMOGRAPHIC OF WHO'S PRACTICING

03:03:01.203 --> 03:03:03.072
LAW. AND MAKING MORE ATTORNEYS

03:03:03.138 --> 03:03:04.640

PROFICIENCIES AND- AND

03:07:27.102 --> 03:07:28.437
ACCOUNTABILITY YOU HAVE TO DO

03:07:28.503 --> 03:07:30.973
IT AT SOME LEVEL. WHY WOULD WE

03:07:31.039 --> 03:07:32.708
CHANGE THAT KIND OF ARBITRARILY

03:07:32.774 --> 03:07:36.345
AND RETROACTIVELY. IN ONE IN

03:07:36.411 --> 03:07:38.113
ONE SECTOR THAT PROFESSION I. I

03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:39.448
THINK THAT SENDS A MIXED

03:07:39.514 --> 03:07:41.149
MESSAGE BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU

03:07:41.216 --> 03:07:42.818
THAT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY ON

03:07:42.884 --> 03:07:44.252
RECIPROCITY WHERE WE DOING

03:07:44.319 --> 03:07:44.920
STUFF FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

03:07:44.987 --> 03:07:46.355
ACTUALLY ALREADY DEMONSTRATED

03:07:46.421 --> 03:07:48.323
THEIR PROFICIENCY. IN ANOTHER

03:07:48.390 --> 03:07:50.425
STATE AND YET WE'RE NOT DOING

03:07:50.492 --> 03:07:52.194
ANYTHING FOR THEM RIGHT NOW.

03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:52.794
WE'RE SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO

03:07:52.861 --> 03:07:56.098
HAVE TO TAKE THE BAR AGAIN

03:07:56.164 --> 03:07:57.332
WHENEVER WHENEVER THEY HOLD IT.

03:07:57.399 --> 03:07:58.467
AND SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED

03:07:58.533 --> 03:07:59.334
HERE FROM OTHER STATES HAVE

03:07:59.401 --> 03:08:01.036
PASSED BARS AND OTHER STATES.

03:08:01.103 --> 03:08:02.904
ARE UNABLE TO PRACTICE LAW EVEN

03:08:02.971 --> 03:08:03.739
THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICING

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:06.742
LAW- MAYBE FOR YEARS IN ANOTHER

03:08:06.808 --> 03:08:08.377
STATE. WE'RE SENDING A MIXED

03:08:08.443 --> 03:08:10.145
MESSAGE TO THEM AS WELL I MEAN

03:08:10.212 --> 03:08:11.413
THAT'S NOT VERY I DON'T SEE

03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:13.382
THAT AS BEING FAIR UNLESS WE'RE

03:08:13.448 --> 03:08:15.250
GOING TO DO THIS FOR EVERYONE.

03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:17.352
ACROSS THE BOARD IT DOESN'T

03:08:17.419 --> 03:08:19.054
STRIKE ME AS BEING A FAIR.

03:08:19.121 --> 03:08:21.023
RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. BUT

03:08:21.089 --> 03:08:22.891
I BUT AGAIN I DO SYMPATHIZE

03:08:22.958 --> 03:08:25.394
WITH. YOU KNOW. MANY HAVE TAKEN

03:08:25.460 --> 03:08:26.662
IT AND WE'RE NW WE'RE CHANGING

03:08:26.728 --> 03:08:28.830
THE SCORE. IT DOES SEEM. YOU

03:08:28.897 --> 03:08:31.633
KNOW. YOU KNOW FOR GONNA CHANGE

03:08:31.700 --> 03:08:32.534
THE SCORE AND THEN AND THEN

03:08:32.601 --> 03:08:34.369
TELL PEOPLE THAT. THE TEAM THAT

03:08:34.436 --> 03:08:35.637
SCORED JUST AS RECENTLY AS

03:08:35.704 --> 03:08:37.339
FEBRUARY THAT YOU YOU STILL

03:08:37.406 --> 03:08:40.475
CAN'T PRACTICE. I SEE THAT BUT

03:08:40.542 --> 03:08:41.576
IT'S A STRUGGLE IT'S GOT TO BE

03:08:41.643 --> 03:08:42.744
A FAIR PROCESS I THINK FOR

03:08:42.811 --> 03:08:44.279
EVERYBODY WHO SIMILARLY

03:08:44.346 --> 03:08:45.981
SITUATED. AND THERE'S A LOT OF

03:08:46.048 --> 03:08:46.682
PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMILARLY

03:08:46.748 --> 03:08:48.350
SITUATED. AND I HAVE A HARD

03:08:48.417 --> 03:08:50.185
TIME JUST SAYING HEY WE'RE

03:08:50.252 --> 03:08:50.719
GONNA DO THIS JUST FOR ONE

03:08:50.786 --> 03:08:53.155
GROUP. AND NOT FOR OTHERS WHO

03:08:53.221 --> 03:08:55.657
ARE ALSO IN THE SAME- BALLPARKS

03:08:55.724 --> 03:08:58.293
SO- I WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE

03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:00.529
THE MISTER CHAIR- WELL WELL.

03:09:00.595 --> 03:09:02.364
WELL THANK YOU EIGHT CAN'T. YOU

03:09:02.431 --> 03:09:04.666
KNOW IF THAT'S YOUR WORRY. WHY

03:09:04.733 --> 03:09:05.634
NOT THIS WE'VE WE'VE ASKED FOR

03:09:05.701 --> 03:09:07.135
UP TO FIVE YEARS THAT IN FIVE

03:09:07.202 --> 03:09:08.103
YEARS IS REALLY WHERE THE

03:09:08.170 --> 03:09:09.971
RECORDS GO WHICH IS WHY WE'VE

03:09:10.038 --> 03:09:11.440
GOT SOME TO LOOK AT THAT.

03:09:11.506 --> 03:09:13.508
BECAUSE THIS REPORT CAN GO BACK

03:09:13.575 --> 03:09:15.877
FIVE YEARS AND GRANT SOMEBODY

03:09:15.944 --> 03:09:19.014
THE ABILITY TO ME THAT THAT'S

03:09:19.081 --> 03:09:20.382
WHAT THEY DO NOW. ATTENTION LEE.

03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:21.550
THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE LAW

03:09:21.616 --> 03:09:23.385
GOING BACK BEYOND THAT. THEY

03:09:23.452 --> 03:09:25.353
MAY NOT EVEN HAVE THE RECORDS

03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:27.289
SO I WANT TO ASK THEMIN THIS.

03:09:27.355 --> 03:09:28.757
THIS IS A COMPONENT ABOUT IT

03:09:28.824 --> 03:09:29.925
RECIPROCITY IS A DIFFERENT

03:09:29.991 --> 03:09:31.460
ISSUE. THIS WILL APPLY TO

03:09:31.526 --> 03:09:34.796
EVERYBODY TAKING THE BAR. AND

03:09:34.863 --> 03:09:36.565
ACROSS THE BOARD GOING BACK TO

03:09:36.631 --> 03:09:38.233
A REASONABLE POINT WHERE THE

03:09:38.300 --> 03:09:40.469
PARK SHOULD HAVE THOSE RECORDS

03:09:40.535 --> 03:09:42.370
AND BE ABLE TO FACILITATE.

03:09:42.437 --> 03:09:44.673
MAKING THIS HAPPEN IF YOU WANT

03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:45.874
TO ADD YOUR VOICE WE'VE BEEN

03:09:45.941 --> 03:09:47.442
ASKING THE BAR TO LOOK AT

03:09:47.509 --> 03:09:49.077
RECIPROCITY AND ANY NUMBER OF

03:09:49.144 --> 03:09:51.613
THINGS. TO BRING PEOPLE INTO

03:09:51.680 --> 03:09:53.215
THE PRACTICE OF LAW WHO WE

03:09:53.281 --> 03:09:55.550
DESPERATELY NEED TO BE HERE

03:09:55.617 --> 03:09:58.353
NOW. AND SO THE CUT SCORE WAS

03:09:58.420 --> 03:10:00.455
ARBITRARY. THE FIVE YEARS IS

03:10:00.522 --> 03:10:03.024
NOT REALLY BECAUSE THAT'S A

03:10:03.091 --> 03:10:05.293
RECORDS ISSUE AND I THINK ONE

03:10:05.360 --> 03:10:07.028
OF THINGS WE MAY FIND OUT IS

03:10:07.095 --> 03:10:07.963
THE BAR MAY NOT EVEN HAVE

03:10:08.029 --> 03:10:09.498
ADEQUATE RECORDS. GOING BACK

03:10:09.564 --> 03:10:10.699
THAT FIVE YEARS THAT MIGHT BE A

03:10:10.766 --> 03:10:11.666
CHALLENGE FOR THEM AND I THINK

03:10:11.733 --> 03:10:12.467
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA

03:10:12.534 --> 03:10:14.202
NEED TO LOOK AT IF THAT'S THE

03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:15.670
CASE BUT THAT'S A REASONABLE

03:10:15.737 --> 03:10:18.707
ASK OF THE BAR. GIVEN RECORD

03:10:18.774 --> 03:10:20.776
LIMITATIONS GIVEN KIND OF HOW

03:10:20.842 --> 03:10:22.978
THOSE PROCESSES WORK IS TO LOOK

03:10:23.044 --> 03:10:25.313
AT WHAT THEY CAN DO WITHIN THAT

03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:27.415
FIVE YEARS. OTHER CATEGORIES

03:10:27.482 --> 03:10:28.517
YES WE NEED TO WORK ON IT

03:10:28.583 --> 03:10:29.217
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

03:10:29.284 --> 03:10:30.452
ADDRESSING HERE THIS IS ONE

03:10:30.519 --> 03:10:31.853
SIMPLE THING BECAUSE THE CUT

03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:33.321
SCORES ARBITRARY AND THEY

03:10:33.388 --> 03:10:35.690
DECIDED TO BE THE THIRTEEN

03:10:35.757 --> 03:10:36.291
NINETY WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR

03:10:36.358 --> 03:10:38.160
THAT BECAUSE OF. MAKING IT A

03:10:38.226 --> 03:10:40.428
RELATIVE IN AND IS EQUITABLE

03:10:40.495 --> 03:10:42.097
ACROSS WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE

03:10:42.164 --> 03:10:43.131
DONE THAT'S HOW WE'VE ARRIVED

03:10:43.198 --> 03:10:44.800
AT THOSE NUMBERS. ME BACK INTO

03:10:44.866 --> 03:10:46.568
THINKING HE IMPARTED QUILL DAYS

03:10:46.635 --> 03:10:47.903
WHEN I TOOK THE BAR WAS A THREE

03:10:47.969 --> 03:10:49.538
DAY TWO BAR AND I HAVE ALWAYS

03:10:49.604 --> 03:10:52.340
SAID IT'S JUST A THREE DAY

03:10:52.407 --> 03:10:53.708
STRESS TEST. AND YOU KNOW WHEN

03:10:53.775 --> 03:10:55.010
WE WITH THOSE LARGER STUDY FOR

03:10:55.076 --> 03:10:56.511
THE BAR THEY TOLD US VERY

03:10:56.578 --> 03:10:58.880
CLEARLY YOU LEARN. AS A LAWYER

03:10:58.947 --> 03:10:59.548
YOU JEWELERS THREE VERY

03:10:59.614 --> 03:11:00.715
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LAW THAT

03:11:00.782 --> 03:11:01.550
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

03:11:01.616 --> 03:11:03.051
WITH EACH OTHER. WHAT YOU

03:11:03.118 --> 03:11:04.753
STUDYING LAW SCHOOL. WHAT YOU

03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:06.221
STUDY TO TAKE THE BAR EXAM AND

03:11:06.288 --> 03:11:07.422
THEN WHAT YOU DO IN ACTUAL

03:11:07.489 --> 03:11:09.624
PRACTICE. THERE'S NOT REALLY

03:11:09.691 --> 03:11:11.426
ANY RELATION BETWEEN ANY OF

03:11:11.493 --> 03:11:12.027
THOSE THREE. THE WHOLE THING'S

03:11:12.093 --> 03:11:13.829
ARMATURE. THE WHOLE THING IS

03:11:13.895 --> 03:11:15.564
NOT NECESSARILY HOPEFULLY

03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:16.731
MITIGATING WHO'S GOING TO BE A

03:11:16.798 --> 03:11:18.600
GOOD PRACTITIONER OF LAW. OR

03:11:18.667 --> 03:11:20.101
NOT. THAT DOES NEED TO BE

03:11:20.168 --> 03:11:21.269
