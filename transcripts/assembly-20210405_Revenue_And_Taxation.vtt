THAT IS CAUSING THIS SO YOU'VE

00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:06.190
GOT PROPERTY OWNERS WHO BELIEVE

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:07.324
THAT THEIR PROPERTIES ARE NOT

00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:09.459

VALUE TO- MAXIMIZE REVENUE TO

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.883
THE COUNTY. SO THE COUNTY HAS

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.018
THE BUDGET TO PROVIDE THE

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:37.020
RESOURCES AND THE SERVICES THAT

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:39.623
ARE NEEDED THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:40.724
FALL ON THE SIDE OF THE TAX

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.326
PAYER WHEN THEY LOOK TO

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.461

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.162
NOT AGREE WITH SOME OF THEM WE

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:40.430
ACTUALLY BELIEVE ARE ALREADY IN

00:51:40.497 --> 00:51:42.632
PLACE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:45.669
THE VOLUME OF CASES- OURS IS SO

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.671
SIGNIFICANT IT MAKES SENSE THAT

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:49.339
MAKES MANEUVERABILITY TO

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:49.840
ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE

00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:51.808
RECOMMENDATIONS. VERY VERY VERY

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.777
DIFFICULT WE ARE HANDLING-

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:55.145
CASES ON A JUST IN TIME

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:58.915
DELIVERY BECAUSE THE NUMBER

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:00.383
THAT COME UP- THAT ARE A BETTER

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.652
SCHEDULE FOR HEARINGS- MY GOAL

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:04.654
IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:05.689
CASES SO THAT WE CAN SPEND MORE

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:07.958
TIME. WITH EACH TAXPAYER TO

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:10.060
RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:10.994
ADMINISTRATIVELY IF POSSIBLE

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.028
PRIOR TO A HEARING AT THE

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:14.297
MOMENT.WE'RE SIMPLY UNABLE TO

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:17.033
DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY.

THE GENTLEMAN SAID REPRESENTING

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.742
THE ASSESSORS IS THAT. MY TWO

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.778
ASSESSORS ABOUT RIVERSIDE. AND

ASSURE. EVERYONE THAT'S IF IT'S

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.815
HERE AND THOSE THAT ARE

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.317
LISTENING. THAT THEY ARE NOT

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.952
INTERESTED IN INCREASING THEIR

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:43.253
BOTH A VERY CONSERVATIVE ARE

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.654
NOT INTERESTED IN INCREASING.

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:46.256
OUR REVENUE A TO THE COUNTY

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:47.424
THEIR JOB IS TO BE ABLE TO

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.292
APPLY. THE LAW AND WHEN THEIR

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.027
APPEALS THAT COME BEFORE THESE

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:53.597
APPEAL BOARDS. THE GOAL IS TO

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:57.033
TRY TO MAKE SURE TO- APPLY THE

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.069
LAW THE PROBLEM IS THE LAW CAN

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:00.370
BE VERY COMPLEX AND

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:02.172
COMPLICATED. AND PEOPLE THAT

00:54:02.238 --> 00:54:03.473
ARE APPOINTED TO THESE BOARDS

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.309
DON'T REALLY FULLY UNDERSTAND.

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.878
WHAT THE LAW. MIGHT BE. AND SO

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:10.213
THERE IS A BENEFIT TO HAVING

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.349
FORMER EMPLOYEES WHO UNDERSTAND

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.149
THE LAW WHO MIGHT WANT TO

00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:16.019
SERVE. TO SIT ON THESE BOARDS

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.221
TO MAKE SURE TO PROPERLY APPLY.

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.923
THE LAW. WHAT I'M STRUGGLING

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.691
WITH IS IN THE OPPOSITION THEY

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:22.859
WERE SAYING WERE FOR GOING TO

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.995
BRING ALLOW THESE- FORMER

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:29.165
RETIREES TO SERVE. IF UP. AFTER

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.433
THREE YEARS BUT GOING FROM

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.202
THREE YEARS TO ONE YEAR. THAT

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:33.303
SEEMS TO BE THAT THE BETTER

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:34.404
STILL WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:35.405
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREE YEARS

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:36.673
OR ONE YEAR THEY'RE STILL

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.641
THEY'RE STILL ABLE TO. TO

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:40.010
SERVE. AND SO IF I CAN HAVE

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:41.011
SOMEBODY FOM THE OPPOSITION

00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.979
TALK ABOUT. THAT BECAUSE I'M

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:44.614
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH. IF

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:46.249
WE'RE ALLOWING THEM AT ALL. THE

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:47.117
ARGUMENT SHOULD BE THEY SHOULD

00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:54.891
BE ABLE TO SERVE. BUT. IS MR

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:57.661
KELLY OR MR KAUFMAN. ON THE

00:54:57.727 --> 00:55:00.096
PHONE. THEY CAN ANSWER THIS

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:03.333
QUESTION YES. HI I AM AND I

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.504
THINK I CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE-

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.507
SPECIFICALLY- I'M SO THEY DON'T

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.409
KNOW WHO YOU ARE. MAYBE IT WAS

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:14.844
STATE YOUR- JOHN KELLY THANK

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:17.914
YOU SHOT. GO AHEAD SORRY ABOUT

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:23.019
THAT- YES I BELIEVE THE ISSUE

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:26.756
THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THERE IS

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:29.592
THERE ISN'T. ANY ISSUE OF

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:31.795
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS BIAS

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.297
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BUT THE WAY

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:35.699
THAT THE REVENUE AND TAXATION

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:40.637
CODE WORKS IS THAT AN

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:41.404
ASSESSMENT OF THE MAIN. AND

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.206
THEN THERE A TWO STATUTE FOR

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:46.443
RESOLVING ASSESSMENT THEREFORE

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:49.412
THE THREE YEARS MAKES SENSE AS

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:52.215
A COOLING OFF PERIOD. AS THE

00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:56.019
STATUTE READ IT IS RESOLVED NOW

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.988
THE LEGAL DATE- THE VALUATION

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:01.858
DATE WOULD BE JANUARY FIRST.

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:04.994
AND THEORETICALLY AN ASSESSOR

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:08.498
COULD LEAD HIM THAT SAME DAY

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:12.635
AND THEN IT HERE. HIS OR HER

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:14.904
OWN CASE. SO THAT THE REASON

00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:17.507
WHY THE THREE YEAR PERIOD IT

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:19.008
WAS INCORPORATED AT THE

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:21.344
BEGINNING OF THE I'M SORRY SAID

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:24.948
THEORETICALLY CAN YOU THE- GET

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:26.750
WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THEORY

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:28.284
BECAUSE THERE IT'S AN EASY FIX

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:29.786
WE HAVE THE PARTS OF AMAZING

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:30.854
WHAT WE CAN DO HERE WE CAN

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.355
ACTUALLY PUT LANGUAGE IN BILLS

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:33.890
AND FIX THAT ABOUT THIRTY IN

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:35.358
LIKE THAT'S THAT IF THAT'S IF

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:39.028
THAT'S THE CASE- SO. WHAT WHAT

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:42.632
DO YOU MEAN BY THEORETICALLY.

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:45.902
WHEN THE ORIGINAL NINETEEN

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:46.936
FIFTY SEVEN LEGISLATION WAS PUT

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:50.206
IN PLACE. THERE WAS A SIX MONTH

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:52.575
TIME PERIOD BETWEEN VALUATION

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.477
AND APPEAL. AND THEN THERE WAS

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:56.279
A TWO YEAR PERIOD WHERE THOSE

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:58.348
APPEALS WOULD BE RESOLVED.

00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.616
WHICH IS WHY THE THREE YEAR

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:02.218
PERIOD WAS PUT INTO PLACE AT

00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:04.454
THE BEGINNING. NOW WE HAVE AN

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:08.792
ISSUE WHERE A SITTING ASSESSOR.

00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:12.996
AND WITH ALL DUE. RESPECT IT'S

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:14.531
NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY'RE

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:17.066
BIASED IT'S JUST WHETHER OR NOT

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:20.069
THEY COULD SET. AND RESOLVE THE

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:22.172
CASE THAT THEY WERE EITHER

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:25.608
APPROVED FOR OR A SUPERVISOR-

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:29.179
OR- IN THAT SAME GROUP BUT NOT

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:31.781
WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:36.786
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE. OKAY IT.

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:38.721
TELL ME ANSWER THE QUESTION IS

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.456
A XIN- BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE

00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:41.624
ABLE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:43.359
ONLY SO WE HAVE GONE TO LEDGE%

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:44.861
COUNCIL WE HAVE AN ORAL OPINION

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:47.030
FROM LEAD COUNSEL AND THAT AND

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:48.698
FORMER EMPLOYEE CANNOTYOUR

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.233
CASE THAT THEY HAVE WORKED ON

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.234
ONE PLATE IT'S JUST IT'S

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:53.169
ALREADY IN LIFE IN COMMON LAW

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.804
SO THIS NOTION THAT THAT CAN

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:57.106
HAPPEN IS. UNFORTUNATELY I

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:58.374
LISTEN I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

00:57:58.441 --> 00:57:59.809
ARE THOSE WHO HAPPEN IF YOU

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:00.977
WAITED THE SYSTEM OVER THE

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:02.579
YEARS BECAUSE OF THE

00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:03.847
OVERWHELMING SYSTEM IT WAS

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.715
EASIER TO MANIPULATE THE

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.283
APPEALS PROCESS IT IS VERY

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.185
TIMELY PROCESS AND SO I GET

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:10.253
THAT THERE'S OPPOSITION THAT

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.356
DOES NOT WANT THERE TO BE MORE

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.591
OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE BILLS

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:15.959
ACTUALLY TO BE PROCESSED ON

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:16.993
TIME BECAUSE THE AUTOMATIC

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.394
DEFAULT IS IF THEY'RE NOT

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:19.929
PROCESSING TIME THEN THEY WIN

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:22.398
THEIR APPEAL. SO I GET ALL THAT

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:25.335
BUT THE REALITY BUT TO CONTINUE

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:28.571
TO IS TO SAY THAT FORMER

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:29.806
EMPLOYEES CAN WORK ON THESE

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:31.708
CASES IT'S JUST NOT THE LAW THE

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:33.676
LAW SAYS OPPOSITE AND WE CAN WE

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:35.378
HEAR AN COLLEGE COUNCIL IF WE

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:37.180
NEED IT BUT WE WENT AND GOT IF

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:39.048
THEIR WORK IF THAT WAS NOT

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:41.885
ALREADY LAW I GUARANTEE YOU WE

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:43.353
WOULD ADD IT TO THE BILL I

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:45.121
DON'T WANT I WANT THE PROCESS

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:46.956
TO BE FAIR I WANT THE PROCESS

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:49.192
TO HAVE MERIT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:51.060
SAID SOME APPEALS HAVE MERIT

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.762
SOME DON'T AND I WANT THE

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:54.063
PROCESS TO BE. TO BE WELL

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:56.065
EXECUTED IN L. A. COUNTY

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:56.866
THERE'S A REASON THIS IS

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:58.101
SPECIFIC L. A. COUNTY WE'RE

00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:00.637
SEEING A HUGE INFLUX BUT THERE

00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:02.639
ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.440
GAIN THE SYSTEM BASED ON THE

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:06.676
INEQUITY OF THE INEFFICIENCY OF

AGAIN IT'S TOP AND SOLD MY GOAL

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.229
IS TO IDENTIFY. THE REASONS AS

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:09.264
TO WHY IT DID HAPPEN EVEN

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.798
THOUGH IT'S ALREADY PART OF THE

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:12.867
PROCEDURE AND- AND WE'VE MADE A

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:14.469

WE WILL KEEP WORKING TO FIND

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:16.971
WHAT THAT TECHNICAL ISSUE IS

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.172
THAT ALLOWED IT TO CAN YES

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:21.442
ABSOLUTELY AND AGAIN I THE

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:23.845
INTENT IS THAT- IT DOESN'T

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:26.114
HAPPEN TO TWO OTHER- MILITARY

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.649
FAMILIES WHILE THEY'RE DEPLOYED

THAT IT WAS A- THAT IT'S

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.556
ALREADY IMPALA BY AGAIN IT HAS

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:36.224
HAPPENED SO. THE GOAL IS TO

OR TO IDENTIFY THE REASON WHY

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:47.569
DID HAPPEN. SO I THINK THERE

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:49.404
ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS ONE

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:51.573
