I AND HOLD THE RESPONSIBILITY TO INSURE THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. THIS EXTENDS THIS BILL EXTENDS A MONITORING THE MINISTRATION OF MIND NUMBING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS THAT CAN LEAD TO IRREVERSIBLE. IN LIFELONG HEALTH IMPACTS IT NOT PRESCRIBED APPROPRIATELY. IN AN EFFORT TO CRACK DOWN ON EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY PSYCHOTROPIC PRESCRIBING TO PASS YOU. THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE PASSED A SERIES OF BILLS AND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN INCLUDING SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WHICH WAS INTENDED TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD DATA. TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL CASES OF INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING. ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR BUILT OFF OF AN EXISTING DATA SHARING AGREEMENT AND ESTABLISH A FORMAL ONGOING PROCESS FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD REVIEW AND CONFIDENTIALLY INVESTIGATE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION PRESCRIPTION PATTERNS. WELL ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD PROVIDING OVERSIGHT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS SINCE INDICATED THAT THE DATA SHARED DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE PRESCRIBING PATTERNS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO CRITICAL MEDICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS FOR THE PSYCH MEDS PRESCRIPTION SB THREE SEVEN SEVEN WILL CUT THROUGH THE RED TAPE AND FINALLY ALLOW FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD. TO GET ACCESS THAT IN INFORMATION THEY NEED TO TO CONFIDENTIALLY INVESTIGATE BY GRANTING AUTHORIZATION WHEN THE MEDICATION IS AUTHORIZED BY THE COURTS CURRENTLY ALL PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION FOR MINORS AND FOUGHT THE FOSTER YOUTH. MUST BE APPROVED BY JUVENILE COURT JUDGE THREE SEVEN SEVEN OH CREATE A PROCESS THAT ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF APPROVAL OF A SITE MADE A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE WILL AUTHORIZE MEDICAL BOARD TO REVIEW THE MEDICAL INFORMATION.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING -- COLLEAGUES -- I CERTAINLY -- APPLAUD THE AUTHOR. FOR HI HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE UTILIZATION OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS -- AND OUR OUR JUVENILES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT -- ARE UNDER THE CARE OF ADULTS AND THE COURTS. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE. TO GET INTO THE PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE HAVE SOME VERY COMPLEX CASES THAT REQUIRE PSYCHIATRIC INTERVENTION. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD QUESTION. OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS THAT. ARE DOING THEIR BEST. WITH THEIR YEARS OF KNOWLEDGE FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL -- MANY YEARS OF GOING INTO PSYCHIATRY. AND AND STARTING A VERY NARROW -- GROUP OF THE DRUGS UNDERSTANDING THEIR PHARMACOLOGY UNDERSTANDING THEIR THEIR THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION [inaudible] AND AND I THINK THIS COULD BE LATE TREATMENT TO KIDS ARE REALLY NEED IT SO. I THINK THE AUTHOR IS IS CERTAINLY ON ON THE RIGHT TRACK. TO REVIEW -- THE OVER UTILIZATION IN CASES MAYBE BY NON PSYCHIATRISTS BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT. HOPEFULLY A MAJORITY THESE KIDS ARE BEING SEEN BY MEDICAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND I THINK WERE OPENING UP PANDORA'S BOX IF WE'RE GONNA START HAVING THE MEDICAL BOARD QUESTIONING THE EFFICACY OF THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. AND I THINK THAT THIS WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO THAT HAPPENING AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL HAVE TO OPPOSE SB. THREE SEVEN SEVEN THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DESCRIPTION -- GREAT. SENATE MCGUIRE TO A CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT SO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS BEEN GIVEN OVERSEE SCRIPT OVERSEE MEDIC PROFESSIONAL PSYCHIATRIST SYCHOLOGIST DOCTORS IN THIS STATE FOR DECADES. FOR DECADES THIS ISN'T WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IN THE MEDICAL BOARD ALREADY HAS FULL AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO DELAYING ANY POTENTIAL PRESCRIPTION THE COURTS TO IT. SO WHEN A FOSTER YOUTH GOES INTO THE COURT. TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON CUSTODY IN MEDICAL PRESCRIBING PATTERNS. THE JUDGE. WITH THE CAN A CONSULTATION OF A PSYCHIATRIST. BRINGS FORD THAT PRESCRIPTION PATTERN. IF WE WANT TO QUESTION THOSE PROFESSIONALS I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS. WHEN THIS BILL WAS A RATE WHEN THE ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ONE IN FOUR TEENS IN FOSTER CARE HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS IN THIRTY SIX OF THOSE YOUTH WE'RE TAKING MULTIPLE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS? 56% OF CHILDREN FOSTER CARE RESIDING IN GROUP HOMES WERE BEING PRESCRIBED. PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION THERE WAS MULTIPLE INVESTIGATIONS DONE BY NEWSPAPERS UP AND DOWN THIS STATE SHOWING THAT THESE PSYCHOTROPIC EDICATIONS.

SENATE BILL EIGHT BY SENATOR GLAZER AN ACT RELATING TO PARKS. THANK YOU ARE MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS AT THOSE WHO ARE HISTORIANS AND I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW HERE ON THE FLOOR -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR BACK IN HISTORY TO REMEMBER CENTER BLOCK FROM SAN DIEGO WHO CARRIED. SIMILAR LEGISLATION TO WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY REGARDING SMOKING BANNING SMOKING IN PARKS AND AND STATE BEACHES HE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE. FOR FOR MANY YEARS AND I HAD TOOK UP THE THE EFFORT -- WITH HIS DEPARTURE. AND WE PASS THIS LEGISLATION TO BAN SMOKING AT STATE PARKS AND BEACHES THROUGH THE SENATE HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES INCLUDING THE PAST YEAR [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY THAT. THE PAST GOVERNOR I'VE MADE A CHOICE IT WAS INTO READY FOR HIM. SO WE'RE COMING BACK IT'S MORE THAN THE THIRD TIME BUT HOPEFULLY FOR WITH ME AT LEAST THIRD TIME WILL BE THE CHARM. BUT THIS BILL WOULD -- PROHIBITS SMOKING AT A STATE PARK MAKE IT INFRACTION PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. THE SMOKING PROHIBITION. CONTAINED IN THE BILL WOULD BE ENFORCED ONLY AFTER SIGNS HAVE BEEN POSTED. THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE DIRECTOR OF PARKS AND REC TO DESIGNATE AREAS AS EXEMPTS. FROM THE SMOKING PROHIBITION. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION TOBACCO KILLS OVER FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR. SECONDS THOUSANDS MORE AND COST THE STATE MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT BILLION IN HEALTH CARE. MEDICAID IN LOST PRODUCTIVITY. ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF SMOKING AND HEALTH CARE COSTS OF THE STATE. ARE VERY WELL KNOWN. A RECENT STATEWIDE POLL CONDUCTED BY THE LUNG ASSOCIATION. SHOW THAT 71% OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORTED POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT. EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE IN AREAS FREQUENTED BY THE PUBLIC CONSERVING THAT'S THE CASE WITH OUR BEACHES AND OUR PARKS. AND IT'S MORE THAN JUST A PERSONAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH SMOKING ALSO HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT. CIGARETTE **** ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF WASTE AND LITTER. CIGARETTES ALSO BECAUSE WILD FIRES ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIRES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SMOKING SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BANNING SMOKING AT STATE PARKS AND AS THE NEXT STEP IN ADDRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH. SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING WITH THAT I ASKED RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE VOTE. ANY DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BORDERS. JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IF I MAY MISTER PRESIDENT WE TO QUESTION FOR YES SIR. SERVICES PRIMARILY AN ANTI SMOKING -- BILL OR IS IT A POLLUTION -- BILL. I IT'S BOTH OF THOSE AND I WOULD SAY IT'S ALSO ALLOWED FIRE -- BILL BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE FIRES THAT IN COST INTERSTATE OF COME FROM SMOKING SO I'D SAY IT'S ALL. THREE THANK YOU. OZ CENTER STERN FAMOUS PRESIDENT -- MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- THIRD TIME HOPEFULLY IS A CHARM I DID WANT TO GET -- A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR THOUGH WE WHEN WE WENT THROUGH COMMITTEE WE KNOW OUR STATE PARK RANGERS ARE CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED OPERATION MAINTENANCE FUNDS ARE HARD TO COME BY WE WONDER GLAZER WERE YOU TAKE A COURSE FORCIBLE SO THAT STERN -- CAN YOU UPDATE US ON YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PARK RANGERS AND WHAT YOU SEE FOR IS AT THAT. TO MAKE THIS A TRULY ENFORCEABLE FRAMEWORK. THANK YOU TO THIS THE SENATOR FROM VENTURA FOR THE QUESTION THAT THE ISSUE HERE AS I UNDERSTAND IT -- IS THERE CONCERN ABOUT ENFORCEMENT THAT WERE SOMEBODY TO MAKE A CLAIM THAT. THEY'RE ENGAGED IN SMOKING FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS THAT IT WOULD MAKE AT ENFORCEMENT DECISION BY THE RANGER MORE DIFFICULT IS THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING HERE. SO -- IN CONSULTATION WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. THE CONCERN IS THAT -- OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT SMOKING AS RELATES TO RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES CREATES A FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS. AND SO IT'S DIVERT TO BE DEPENDENT UPON THE RANGER TO MAKE THE BEST CHOICE THAT THEY CAN MAKE HERE SHE CAN MAKE IN THE FIELD. AND THAT THE COURT SYSTEM WOULD YOU QUE WHETHER OR NOT THAT JUDGMENT WAS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT CLAIM OF A RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION. AND SO THAT IS A A EXEMPTION IN THE BILL. IT WAS CAREFULLY THOUGHT THROUGH BECAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES I'M SENSITIVE TO THE ENFORCEMENT CHOICE THAT. RANGERS WOULD NEED TO MAKE UNDER IT AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO CONTINUING THAT. THAT CONVERSATION IN TRYING TO BALANCE -- THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB WELL WHICH THEY'RE VERY WELL EQUIPPED TO DO AND DO SO WELL. AS WELL AS THE PROTECTIONS FOR A RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THAT REMAINS -- CHALLENGE. THANK YOU. TO THE TO THE SENATOR FROM CONTRA COSTA I WOULD I WOULD JUST URGE GOING FOR TO MAKE THIS BILL WORK. WE NEED TO SOLVE A CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND OUR STATE PARK SYSTEM SO LOOK FOR TO PARTNERING WITH YOU ON THAT EFFORT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THE RANGERS HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO GO.

PASS OUR FURRY FRIENDS SUFFER FROM MANY OF THE SAME IF NOT SIMILAR AILMENTS THAT HUMANS DO AND WHICH MEDI MEDICINAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE. A THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT. SINCE VETERINARIANS ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED ON HOW THEY CAN DISCUSS THE USE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS. PET OWNERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO TREAT THEIR ANIMALS OFTEN TURN TO THE INTERNET OR ADVICE OR SIMPLY SEEK THE COUNSEL OF THE RETAIL CANNABIS CLERK. BEHIND THE COUNTER FOR RECOMMENDATIONS PUTTING THE SAFETY OF THEIR PAT IN JEOPARDY. RATHER THAN GETTING THE ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL THEIR LOCAL VETERINARIAN PET OWNERS ARE UNINTENTIONALLY PUTTING THEIR PETS HEALTH AND SAFETY IN DANGER. ANIMAL CAN OF CANNABINOID RECEPTOR SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT FROM HUMANS SO DOSAGES MUST BE ADJUSTED FOR THE TYPE OF ANIMAL ITS WEIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THE CONDITION YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT THIS MEASURE SIMPLY PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR THOSE VETERINARIANS WHO CHOOSE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE US OF CANNABIS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.

THANK YOU MISTER PRO TEM SENATORS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SIX NINETY SEVEN WHICH WILL MODERNIZE THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PRACTICE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO FACE A SHORTFALL OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS WITH ACUTE SHORTAGES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY CENTRAL COAST AND SOUTHERN BORDER AREAS. THIS IS DUE TO THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF CARE ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS A LACK OF SUPPLY OF CLINICIANS. TO COMBAT THE SHORTAGE SB SIX NINETY SEVEN FOCUSES ON EXPANDING. POSITION UTILIZATION PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS OR PDAS. REGULATIONS PA'S ARE SUBJECT TO WERE WRITTEN DECADES AGO AND HAVE NOT PROGRESSED WITH PRACTICING MEDICINE MEDICINE TODAY.

SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR STERN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTRICITY. CENTER STERN. FAMOUS PRESIDENT MEMBERS. AS WE NOTE WILDFIRE SEASON IS NO LONGER SEASON. IT IS YEAR ROUND THIS THREAD IS INCREASING. AND WITH THAT INCREASING THREAT WE WILL SEE MORE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AND OUR COMMUNITIES. IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM. THAT THERE IS NOT RETICENCE AMONG OUR UTILITIES TO UTILIZE THIS IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK. BUT ALSO NOT LEAVE OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE DARK. THERE ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FOLKS ON MEDICAL BASELINE FIRE STATIONS WATER PUMPING STATIONS TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE STATE. THAT WE DESPRATELY NEED TO BE ONLINE AND POWERED [inaudible] DURING FIRES. WE SEEN THE TRAGEDIES ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE TO THOSE SYSTEMS. THIS BILL WOULD PUT ONE MORE PIECE IN THE PUZZLE. IN A WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS OF OUR UTILITIES TO ASK THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO CONSIDER THE USE OF MICROGRAMS ANOTHER DISTRIBUTED TECHNOLOGY AT OUR CRITICAL SWITCHES. WHERE ARE UTILITIES ARE MOST VULNERABLE AT SUBSTATIONS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES? BUT THE BILL ALSO TOUCHES ON THE END USERS AS WELL AND WE'VE HEARD. THE CONCERNS FROM THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE COMMUNITY -- AS WELL AS FROM C. C. A.'S AND OTHER CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS OF THE PAST FEW MONTHS SINCE THIS BILL MOVED THEIR ENERGY -- WE ARE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING NOT JUST ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS BUT MEETING HIM EXPANDING UPON THEM. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO ADDRESS THE RISKS OF BACK UP POWER AND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. BUT WE DON'T THINK MONEY'S GONNA SOLVE THIS WE THINK IS GOING TO TAKE WORK IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO ADDRESS OUR MOST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT MAY HAVE TO DO WITH UNDER GROUNDING THAT MAYBE ABOUT GETTING MORE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AT PUMPING STATIONS. AT THIS POINT THE BILL IS IS A MODEST FRAMEWORK THAT IS PERMISSIVE IT STILL ALLOWS THE UTILITIES COMMISSION TO REJECT AN APPLICATION FOR MIKE REGRADE OR OTHER UPGRADES TO CRITICAL CIRCUITS BUT WE NEED TO MOVE THIS YEAR. MEMBERS AND WE HOPE THAT THIS BILL CAN BE A VEHICLE FOR SOME PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN THAT REGARD. AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES KEEP THE LIGHTS ON DESPITE THE LOOMING RISK THAT FACE THEM RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I'VE. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

FORTY ONE BY SENATOR JACKSON MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FIFTY FIVE BY SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO FIREARMS INNER JACKSON. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUESI RISE TODAY. AS TODAY IS THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY. OF THE ISLA VISTA MASSACRE. WE'RE SIX STUDENTS WERE KILLED BY A YOUNG MAN WHO WENT TOTALLY OFF THE RAILS AND HAVE POSSESSION OF A NUMBER OF FIREARMS. HE DROVE THROUGH THE CITY STREETS OF ISLA VISTA CAUGHT OFF. OVER SEVENTY FIVE ROUNDS FORTUNATELY WAS NOT. ABLE. TO CALVET CUT ALL SEVENTY FIVE VICTIMS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN. KILLED OR INJURED BUT HE DID KILLED SIX PEOPLE. AND WOUNDED A NUMBER OF OTHERS FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY. AND IT WAS AFTER THAT HORRIFIC EVENT. THAT ONE OF THE FATHERS OF A VICTIM WHO WOULD ACTUALLY GONE INTO A GROCERY STORE TO BUY SOME FOOD FOR DINNER. RICHARD MARTINEZ. WHO MADE A RALLYING CRY THAT SAID NOT? ONE MORE. BUT IN THAT FIVE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN DOZENS MORE [inaudible] FAMILIES. WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN? IN SCHOOL RELATED VIOLENCE IN ST RELATED VIOLENCE VIOLENCE. WITH THE USE OF FIREARMS BY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THEM IN THEIR POSSESSION. IT IS IN THE SPIRIT OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I BRING FORWARD TODAY SB. FIFTY FIVE COLLEGE BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE. CREATED A CENTER. FOR RESEARCH INTO FIREARM RELATED VIOLENCE. THIS WAS DONE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS AND IT WAS A BILL THAT WAS BROUGHT BY THEN SENATOR LOIS WALK. AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE HAVE SEEN EXTRAORDINARY RESEARCH DONE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. MORE ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE WHO COMMITTED WHY WHAT CAN WE DO TO PREVENT IT WHAT CAN WE DO TO DISTRACT PEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE USE GUNS. AS A WAY TO EITHER RESOLVE HEIR DIFFERENCES EXPRESS THEIR ANGER OR OTHERWISE DO DAMAGE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH [inaudible] TO OTHERS. DRAWING ON THAT RESEARCH PUBLIC RESEARCH EXCUSE ME PUBLISHED RESEARCH FINDINGS. SHOW A STRONG CORRELATION. BETWEEN CERTAIN ALCOHOL AND DRUG RELATED CONVICTIONS AND FUTURE GUN VIOLENCE. THIS HERE TODAY IS A BILL BASED UPON DATA BASED UPON SCIENCE BASED UPON UNCONTROVERTED RESEARCH [inaudible] THIS MEASURE. IDENTIFIES THAT ALCOHOL AND DRUG RELATED CONVICTIONS. CREATE A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT THOSE VERY PEOPLE WILL USE FIRE ARMS IN FUTURE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR IN FACT OUR UP TO FIVE TIMES. LIKELIER TO USE A FIREARM. THEN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT. EXPERIENCED THOSE CONVICTIONS THIS MEASURE WILL PROHIBIT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO ABUSE FIREARMS FROM POSSESSING THEM. THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THREE D. WIDE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE CONVICTIONS WITHIN A TEN YEAR PERIOD. TO BRING ABOUT THIS PROHIBITION. OTHER CRIMES IN THE BILL INCLUDE THINGS LIKE BUT HE KILLER MANSLAUGHTER. WHILE INTOXICATED AND CERTAIN INTENT TO SELL DRUG CRIMES WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ONLY TWO CONVICTIONS WITHIN A THREE YEAR PERIOD WHY BECAUSE THE RESEARCH IN THE DATA SHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE FIVE TIMES LIKELIER. TO ENGAGE IN FUTURE CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND WITH A FIREARM THAT IS THE DATA THAT IS THE SCIENCE. NO THIS BILL IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT SENATOR WALL BROCK. SB FIFTY FIVE WHICH PASSED THROUGH BOTH HOUSES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH THE SUPPORT OF A NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS HERE ON THIS FLOOR TODAY. AGAIN. WE HAVE THE DATA WE HAVE THE SCIENCE IT IS CLEAR WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT THIS VIOLENCE AND WHILE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET. THE WHOLE OF NOT ONE MORE WE CAN CERTAINLY WITH THE HELP AND PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION REDUCE. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS RELATED FATALITIES GOING FORWARD AND WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NELSON. THIS PAGE LADIES DOWN THE SENATE. I'M STRUCK BY THE IRONY. THE GREAT MOVE IN CALIFORNIA NOW IS TO DECLARE. CRIMINALIZE DRUGS. THERE NO PROBLEM. WE DO NOT WANT TO FILL OUR PRISONS AND JAILS WAS DRUG. OFFENDERS. EVEN THOSE WHO SELL. WE'RE GONNA GO EASY ON SAYS SAYS PROP FORTY SEVEN EVEN THE PEOPLE WERE DUPED. INTO THAT MEASURE. THIS IS A HARD PULL WEIGHT. TO DISARM MORE CALIFORNIANS. NOW THERE ARE CERTAIN DRUGS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS. I DON'T HEAR THAT TALKED ABOUT MUCH AROUND HERE METHAMPHETAMINE. THAT'S THE MEAN DRUG. THE WOMAN WHO TAKES METHAMPHETAMINE IS A ONE WOULD BE SURE CHILDREN. THANK YOU FOR THE FATHER'S METHAMPHETAMINE. DOES THAT ABSOLUTELY MEAN THEN WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER. A WEAPON. WELL THAT MAKES ALL KINDS OF SENSE ENHANCE A BIT OF LOGIC IN THIS [inaudible] EXCEPT THAT. FOUR EIGHTY OF THIS DRUG OFFENDERS OF WHICH THERE ARE FEWER NOW ANYWAY. TO ASSUME THAT THEY THEN SHOULD HAVE A TEN YEAR. MORATORIUM ON HAVING A FIREARM NOW. THEY'VE DONE NOTHING RIGHT NOW BUT THE DRUGS. HOWEVER IN LEGISLATION. THAT HAS PASSED. WE ARE FORGIVING. INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY USED A GUN. FROM HAVING AN ENHANCED SENTENCE. NOW IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING. REPEAL THAT BILL AT WELL ARE YOU THINK IT'S NOT ALWAYS THROUGH YET BUT THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE GOING NOT. MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE. IF YOU USE A GUN THEN. YES YOU PAY A GREATER PENALTY. ALL NO NO YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. NO NO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYMORE ENHANCEMENTS. ENHANCEMENTS FOR THE USE OF A FIREARM USE A GUN G TO PRISON WAS VOTED ON TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I GUESS THEY WERE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT. THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE FOR USING A GUN. LET'S ADDRESS THE INDIVIDUAL. AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT INDIVIDUAL'S BEHAVIOR OR MAKE A PRESUMPTION [inaudible] THE DRUGS. HAVE A GUN [inaudible] THE DANGERS. I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THE PERVERSE LOGIC. THIS IS SIMPLY ANOTHER WAY. TO DISARM. CALIFORNIANS I REGION OVER. THE KEYS SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THE AND COLLEAGUES YOU DON'T. WE AGREE ON PROBABLY 90% OF THE ISSUES THAT HIT THE FLOOR WE USE OUR UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO A LOT TEN THERE ARE. A FEW ISSUES. A FEW ISSUES THAT. THAT DIVIDE US [inaudible] AND WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL I THINK THAT WE WE DON'T BE HYPOCRITICAL -- AS WE DISCUSS THESE VERY SENSITIVE ISSUES. OF COURSE I I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB. FIFTY FIVE AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. I THINK I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL REPUBLICANS IN THIS COUNTRY INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE DEPLORE. THE VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE BEING USE WITH GUNS ESPECIALLY IN OUR SCHOOLS [inaudible] AND IT'S A SYMPTOM OF OUR LACK OF PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO OUR YOUNGSTERS IT FIND THEMSELVES MORNING NEED A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND I WOULD. SAY THAT A BIG FACTOR IN THAT REQUIREMENT IS BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA [inaudible] SO. THIS BILL WILL PLACE A TEN YEAR. FIRE ARM PROHIBITION ON INDIVIDUALS AND NON VIOLENT DRUG. OR SUBSTANCE USE BEHAVIOR. USING A MISDEMEANOR. I FIND IT VERY IRONIC. THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN PEOPLE THAT USE OPIATES. IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S UP AND DOWN MAKE WE'VE LOST MORE PEOPLE TO OVERDOSES OF NARCOTICS THEN WE LOST IN THE VIETNAM WAR. AND A BIG CULPRIT. IN THESE DEATHS [inaudible] IS. THE IMPORTATION THE ILLICIT IMPORTATION OF FAT KNOWN TO THIS COUNTRY. AND I PARK WITH. MANY OF YOU INCLUDING OUR OUR BUDGET CHAIR ABOUT MY CONCERNS ABOUT. NOT ALLOWING BILLS TO MOVE FORWARD. THAT DON'T GO AFTER THE USER AS AS AGGRESSIVELY AS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BUT TO GO AFTER THE DISTRIBUTORS OF THESE POISONS. BETTER MARKETING THESE POISONS AS THOUGH THEY ARE. ANOTHER NARCOTIC AS AN EXAMPLE FENTANYL. FIFTY TIMES STRONGER THAN HEROIN. BUT BE MARKETED AS HEROIN. SO IN SOME. UNBEKNOWNST ABUSER IS INJECTING HEROIN THEY THINK THEY'RE INJECTING HEROIN. THEY ARE DYING OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION WHILE THE NEEDLE IS IN THEIR ARMEN STILL PUMPING THE PLUNGER OF THAT POISON INTO THEIR VEINS. YEAH WHEN MY COLLEAGUES. FOR MORE AS COUNTY BRINGS BILLS FOR TO STOP THIS AND TO REALLY PUT SOME TEETH INTO THE LAWS TO STOP THE THE NEEDLESS LOSS OF LIFE OF THOUSANDS. NOT A FEW BUT THOUSANDS OF LIVES. THIS LEGISLATOR WON'T EVEN LET THOSE BILLS. AT A COMMITTEE [inaudible] YOU DON'T. I KNOW MANY OF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SECOND AMENDMENT. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT DIDN'T PUT A BILL FORWARD. AND SAY YOU WANT ABOLISHED SECOND AMENDMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE GOING TO DISREGARD FEDERAL LAW LIKE WE WE DO OFTEN HERE. THANK HEAVENS FOR THE CORE LAW. BECAUSE MANY TIMES WHEN WE HAVE. NOT GREAT BILLS IKE THIS THAT. CHALLENGE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THE COURTS HAVE TO INTERVENE AND FIVE OPINED THAT THIS WILL PROBABLY GET OFF THE FLORIDA POLY MAKE IT TO THE ASSEMBLY A PROBLEM MAKE THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. AND THAT WE GOT A WASTE TAXPAYER MONEY ON DEFENDING THE PORTAL LAW AND ULTIMATELY THE GUN RIGHTS GROUPS ARE GOING TO SHOW THAT -- IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL SO. IF YOU HAVE A MINOR MISDEMEANOR. INVOLVING SUBSTANCE ABUSE. HE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET A FIREARM FOR TEN YEARS BUT THIS IS CRAZY. BUT IF YOU'RE TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND YOU RAPE A TEENAGER YOU'LL BE OUT OF PRISON WITH A CLEAN RECORD WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE. I'M SORRY BUT THIS JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME IF YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. SO CALLED MASS INCARCERATION AND THE LESS DESIRE TO EMPTY OUR PRISONS AND MAKING OUR OUR COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE WHICH IS ACTUALLY HAPPEN. ARE WE NOT GOING TO BE TO PASSING BILLS A DEPRIVE INDIVIDUALS OF THE RIGHT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGHER STATISTICAL PROBABILITY. THAT THEY MAY ENGAGE IN VIOLENT GUN RELATED CRIMES. YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OFTEN ON THE FLOOR THE SENATE THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE'S BRAINS DON'T MATURE UNTIL THEIR UNTIL TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. I THINK MANY OF YOU. I'VE EVEN MENTIONED ON THE FLOOR THE SENATE WELL. IF THEY DON'T HAVE A MATURE BRAIN OF WHY ARE WE TRYING TO LET SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS VOTE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT CONCEPT HOUSES FAIR. HOW DOES THIS BILL EVEN MAKES SENSE AND SHORT? PASSING LAWS TO TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS OR IMPOSE PUNISHMENTS BASED ON INDIVIDUALS HIGHER STATISTICAL PROBABILITY. IS NOT A PATH. BUT LAWMAKERS SHOULD BE MAKING IN THE STATE. THIS IS A BAD BILL. THIS IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL. BILL IF IT BECOMES LAW AND FOR THOSE REASONS. STAND UP FOR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND SAY NOTE SB. THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO. I LOVE IT THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. YOU TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT OBJECTION OF COURSE. THE READING A MATCH -- SENATOR I'M I'M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE RESEARCH THAT YOU CITED -- IT IS AT NEW INFORMATION FOR ME AND AND AND ANY TIME WE CAN USE GOOD SCIENCE TO ADVANCE GOOD POLICIES ON THEIR ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED BY PAR ACT WAS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BACKLOG. OF UPDATE IN THEIR LISTS OF WHO CAN AND CANNOT OWN WEAPONS NO IT'S WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT THAT BE HAPPY -- TO THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THIS IS GOING TO BURDEN THE COURTS AND OTHERS WITH HAVING TO GO BACK AND IDENTIFY HOW MANY DO YOU AYE SOMEONE'S HAD. SO THE BILL ACTUALLY -- AS IT'S PRESENTLY CONSTITUTED IDENTIFIES THAT IT IS ONLY A FUTURE DO YOU WHY SOMEONE OTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE TO DRUNK DRIVING CONVICTIONS IN THESE OUR CONVICTIONS -- WITHIN THE PAST TEN YEARS AND YOU GET A THIRD ARREST AND CONVICTION SUBSEQUENT TO THAT SO IF THIS BILL BECOMES EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST. IF YOU GET A DRUNK DRIVING ARREST ON JANUARY SECOND AND A CONVICTION IN. MAY AND THE COURT THEN WE'LL LOOK BACK EACH RAP SHEET BECAUSE THAT TAKES ABOUT TEN SECONDS. AND IF THEY SEE THAT YOU'VE HAD TWO PRIOR DO YOU Y. CONVICTIONS AND NOW A THIRD CONVICTION. THAT INFORMATION WILL THEN GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO BE PLACED ON THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST IT SHOULD TAKE A TOTAL OF MAYBE FIVE MINUTES. AND HOPEFULLY OF COURSE THERE IS MORE MONEY BEING -- GIVEN A TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PROHIBITED PERSONS AS THE GREAT IRONY THERE BY THE WAY. IS THAT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE STARTED BUYING GUNS WE GOT. WE GOT BEHIND IN PUTTING PEOPLE ON THAT LIST WE ARE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO CORRECTING THAT A PROBLEM AND AGAIN IF WE CAN SAVE THE LIVES. OF YOUNG PEOPLE OR ANY INNOCENT PERSON. WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE VICTIM OF SOMEONE WHO WAS KNOWN TO BE FIVE TIMES LIKELIER TO USE A FIREARM IN THE FUTURE? THEN IT IS WORTH THAT COST SO -- I APPRECIATE IN YOUR OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THE SCIENCE IS THERE SOMETIMES IN THIS WORLD WE REALLY NEED TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE IN FACT WE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING SCIENCE THAT'S WHY THIS -- ENTITY WAS CREATED WHY THIS RESEARCH INSTITUTE WAS CREATED THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS -- FOCUSED ON THE SPECIFIC SIGNS UP RATHER THAN PERHAPS IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT OF METHAMPHETAMINES IN THE FUTURE I'D BE DELIGHTED TO DO THAT IF THE RESEARCH SHOWS A SIMILAR PROPENSITY. THEN WE WOULD INCLUDE IT RIGHT NOW THE RESEARCH DEALS WITH THE ISSUES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT MATTER THIS BILL. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT I BROUGHT IT FORWARD. IT IS CLEARLY CONSTITUTIONAL I WILL ADDRESS SAID IN MY CLOTHES BUT THAT IS THE THINKING BEHIND. THE USE OF THAT TIME FRAME. THE SCIENTIST ABLUTIONS CONFIRM SAID AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND PUT THOSE PEOPLE ON THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M ON MY OWN TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION NIGHT YOU KNOW I'M I'M ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL -- I A COME FROM A RURAL DISTRICT WHERE HUNTING IS IS STILL VERY POPULAR AND FROM A FAMILY OF HUNTERS AS WELL AND SOME ALWAYS -- VERY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY ENJOY THEIR GUNS THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HUNT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CARRY THEIR GUNS WITH THEM -- AND AND THEY SAID THEY WANT TO SAFELY STORE THEM UP THIS WAY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY DIFFERENT AND I I WANTED -- TO RISE AND SPEAK TO IT BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW THE AND THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS THE HIGHEST IN ANY OTHER NATION IN IN YOUR AND IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED NATION. AND AND IF WE CAN HAVE PRODUCTIVE FEATURES IT'LL TELL US WHO'S MORE LIKELY. TO BE ABLE TO OR WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO BE A DANGER -- IN IN IN THEIR AVAILABILITY OF GUNS I I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BASED ON THE RESEARCH AND AND REALLY IF IF WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH -- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THEIR BACKLOG WE OUGHT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT UP TO DATE NETTLE RESOLVE THAT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE SO I THINK YOU. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR FOR THIS BILL AND I THINK YOU -- FOR FOR BEING THE CHAMPION OF FAMILIES THAT ARE ARE ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS [inaudible] SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I WOULD JUST LIKE YOU GUYS TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT -- A LOT OF THE GUN VIOLENCE THAT IS CREATED OR A PERPETRATED ANOTHER INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARMS. WE GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THERE IS A BILL THAT WENT TROUGH THE ASSEMBLY WHEN I WAS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. AND IT REQUIRED ALL FIREARMS TO BE REGISTERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BY SERIAL NUMBER. NOW LAW ABIDING CITIZENS GOT IN THERE SAVE ZERO DOWN THE SERIAL NUMBERS AND THEY TOOK THE MODEL NUMBER AND THEY SUBMITTED IT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO WE CAN BE RECORDED. BUT THE ILLEGAL POSSESSORS OF FIREARMS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ILLEGALLY POSSESS FIREARMS FOR PURPOSES THAT ARE EITHER GANG RELATED. DRUG DEALING ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE THAT ILLEGALLY POSSESS FIREARMS. THEY DON'T THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THAT LAW THEY'RE NOT GOING. TO TAKE THEIR ILLEGAL POSSESSED FIRE ARM GET THE SERIAL NUMBER TURN IT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND COMPLY WITHOUT LAW. DISLIKE THIS LAW THIS LAW WILL IF IT PASSES WILL GET PEOPLE WHO ARE LEGALLY POSSESS HAVE LEGALLY POSSESSION OF FIREARMS. IF THEY GET A D. WIRE THREE D. WISE THEN THEY WILL YOU LOSE THEIR LEGAL RIGHT TO POSSESS THESE GUNS. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO PREVENT PEOPLE LIKE GUSTAVO ERIOGONUM. ESTADO AIR IAGO WAS DRIVING DRUNK IN NEWMAN CALIFORNIA. AND GUSTAVO AIR IAGO WAS -- ON THE FREEWAY DRIVING ERRATICALLY HE GOT PULLED OVER BY A NEWMAN POLICE OFFICER HE WAS BREAKING THE LAW FOR DRIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT A VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE HE WAS BREAKING THE LAW BECAUSE HE HAD HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM WHICH WAS HE IS NOT. AUTHORIZED TO HAVE ANY BROKE THE LAW WHEN HE OPENED FIRE ON A THIRTY PLUS YEAR OLD POLICE OFFICER NAMED RAY NIELSEN. THIS BILL AND THE BILLS THAT GO THROUGH THIS BUILDING ARE NOT GOING TO STOP PEOPLE LIKE GUSTAVO. JAGA FROM COMMITTING CRIMES WITH FIREARMS IT'S NOT IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHTS OF I WANT TO SAY LAW ABIDING CITIZENS CAN'T GET A D. Y.. I GET IT I THINK THE NUMBER WILL BE THE MINIMUS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. BECAUSE NUMBER ONE IF YOU ARE IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM AND YOU HAVE A C. C. W. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ALCOHOL. YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE TO KERRY LIABILITY INSURANCE THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF TRAINING THAT YOU HAVE TO GO. TO BUT TO BE IN POSSESSION OF A CCW THIS BILL JUST ARREST FIREARMS IN YOUR HOME FIREARMS THAT HAVE TO BE LOCKED UP AT NIGHT THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE FIREARMS IN YOUR HOME IS TO PROTECT YOU FROM A PERPETRATOR BECAUSE IT TAKES TEN MINUTES FOR POLICE TO GET. THERE SO WE HAVE A FIRE IN YOUR HOME FOR EXCUSE ME MR BURGLAR LET ME READ TO MY SAFE IN OPEN IT BECAUSE HAS TO BE LEGALLY LOCKED UP AT NIGHT. AND YOU GO THIRTY TO THE RIGHT FORTY SIX TO THE LEFT AND CONTINUE TURN THE DIAL AND HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T GET SHOT BY THE TIME. THAT YOU OPEN YOUR SAFETY GEAR FIREARM OUT TO PROTECT YOU SOME OF THE LAWS THAT GO THROUGH THIS BUILDING -- ALMOST TO THE POINT ABSURD AND ALL THAT DOES RESTRICT THE RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT ANY BILL THAT GOES THIS BUILDING IS NOT GOING TO STOP. THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE GUSTAVO AIRY AGA FROM POSSESSING A FIREARM BECAUSE HAD HE FOLLOWED THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN THE FIRST PLACE. HE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ON OUR ROADS HE WOULD NEVER BEEN DRIVING WITHOUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND HE WOULD NEVER BEEN IN POSSESSION OF AN ILLEGAL FIREARM THAT KILLED ONE OF OUR OWN. SO I ASK YOU FOR NOVEMBER. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER JACKSON SELECT CLOTHES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU KNOW MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS RIGHT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO USE A FIREARM BUT WE ARE GOING TO STOP THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE THOSE FIREARMS. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO ARGUABLY THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM USING FIREARMS IS TO GET RID OF FIREARMS AND THERE'S A SECOND MEMBER WE KEEP HEARING. ABOUT WHICH OF COURSE STARTS WITH THE A WELL REGULATED MILITIA BUT IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT FACT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE SCIENCE. THE SCIENCE THAT SHOWS THAT THESE PEOPLE AND BY THE WAY THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THREE DRUNK DRIVING CONVICTIONS OR ABUSES. OF ALCOHOL LEADING TO CONVICTION WHICH THE SCIENCE SHOWS. CREATES A GREATER PROPENSITY BY FIVE TIMES. ON THE USE OF FIREARMS IN THE COMMISSION OF A FAN AN OFFENSE GOING FORWARD. ADD TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM TEMECULA WHO I KNOW IS A FORMER. A FORMER SUIT THE PHARMACIST BUT NOT AN ATTORNEY -- THIS FLOOR IS CLEARLY CONSTITUTIONAL IN FACT THERE ARE MANY OTHER. LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT EXIST TODAY WHICH CREATE FIREARMS PROHIBITIONS LIKE CONVICTION FOR A FELONY. ADDICTION TO A NARCOTIC DRUG ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF A FIREARM ASSAULT WITH A FIREARM IF YOU ARE THE VICTIM OR IF YOU ARE SUBJECT TO A PROTECTIVE ORDER -- IF YOU ARE FOUND NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY SO THIS NOTION THAT IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IS JUST. NOT ACCURATE. BUT WHAT IS ACCURATE IS THE RESEARCH AND THE DATA AND THE FACT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENHANCING SENTENCES AFTER PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE DOESN'T HELP THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD. BUT IF WE CAN PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING THEN WE WILL HAVE DONE SOMETHING MEANINGFUL FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

ART ITEM. FORTY THREE SENATOR WINNER ARE YOU PREPARED. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ONE TWENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. CENTER WIENER I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES SB -- ONE TWENTY SEVEN WILL FINALLY INSURER -- AND REQUIRE CALTRANS TO CONSIDER FIFTH ENTERS SECTION SAID CROSSWALKS AND PROTECTED BIKE LANES ON PARTS OF OUR STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM -- THAT ARE USED AS LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS -- THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER CLASSICS STATE HIGHWAYS IT'S ABOUT THE QUOTE ON QUOTE STATE HIGHWAYS THAT ARE OWNED BY CALTRANS ARE TECHNICALLY PART OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. BUT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM OR ACTUALLY SURFACE STREETS THAT RUN THROUGH CITIES. FOR EXAMPLE PARTS OF SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD IN LOS ANGELES -- SAN PABLO AVENUE IN THE EAST BAY. AND BAD NASA NINETEENTH AVENUES IN SAN FRANCISCO THESE ARE TECHNICALLY STATE HIGHWAYS -- BUT THEY ARE CITY STREETS THAT PEOPLE ARE USING AND ALL SORTS OF WAYS OTHER THAN DRIVING A CAR ENDS FOR CYCLISTS. FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR TRANSIT. IN ADDITION AND MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES A STATE HIGHWAY OFTEN FUNCTIONS AS THE COMMUNITIES ONLY MAIN STREET. UNFORTUNATELY CALTRANS HAS A HISTORY WHEN THEY ARE DOING WORK ON THE STREETS. TO SIMPLY -- TREAT THEM AS IF THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY YOUR CLASSIC STATE HIGHWAY AND NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SAFETY NEEDS OF PEDESTRIANS CYCLISTS AND TRANSIT RIDERS. AS A RESULT FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE IT IS UNSAFE TO CROSS THE STREET TO WALK. ALONG THE STREETS OR TO RIDE BIKES OR WAIT FOR THE BUS ON THE STREETS. HI SO SB ONE TWENTY SEVEN WILL REQUIRE -- THEY CALTRANS HIGHWAYS RUNNING THROUGH URBANIZED AREAS BE SAFE FOR ALL ROAD USERS. NOT JUST VEHICLES AND DESIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF PEDESTRIANS CYCLISTS AND TRANSIT RIDERS IN MIND. WHILE ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY IN SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S NOT FEASIBLE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. THE BILL ALSO CREATE A BRANCH OF ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION WITHIN CALTRANS TO OVERSEE AND COORDINATE EFFORTS ON ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND COMPLETE STREETS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THESE PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD -- DIED THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED I WANT TO THANK THE TERRIBLE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AND COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS SB TOOL FOR REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES D. W. R.. TO INFORM LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES OF PENDING STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTS AND AMENDMENTS. WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA WATER FIXES A PROPOSAL TO BUILD A CONVEYANCE UNDER THE DELTA TO ROUTE TO DIRECTLY SHIP WATER. THE STATE WATER PROJECT POTS THE CONVENIENCE OF CONSTRUCTED WOULD BE PART OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. DEVELOPMENT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROJECT IS CARRIED OUT -- BY D. W. R. PURSUANT TO CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE D. W. R. ITS STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE KNOWS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THESE CONTRACTS. AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE WATER FIX PROJECT. FUNDING FOR WATER FIX IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED THEREFORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT IS TYPICALLY PERFORMED BY OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE SIMPLY DOESN'T OCCUR. THE APPLICATION IMPACTS OF THE WATER FIX ARE ENORMOUS SB TO AFFORD ABOUT TRANSPARENCY INSURING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE AWARE OF ANY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. A D. W. R. IN WATER CONTRACTORS IN -- INTO BEFORE THEY HAPPEN I APPRECIATE GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S WATER FIX PROJECT RESET AND DOUBTS COUPLE WEEKS AGO. NOW THE D. W. R. WILL BEGIN A NEW ASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE JUST BE INFORMED A PROJECT PLANTS AND CHANGES. TO THAT END THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION IT WILL BE WITH ANNUALLY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WATER FIX DESIGN CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING PROGRESS.

WHILE THE STATE HAS CLEARLY RECOGNIZED IMPORTANCE OF THESE ACTIVITIES IT HAS YET TO FULLY EQUIPPED FOSTER AGENCIES IN FOSTER PARENTS WITH THE RESOURCES TO MEET. THOSE NEEDS.

FOR EXTRACURRICULAR AND ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES THE BILL ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA FOSTER YOUTH IT IN HAND IN RICHMOND GRANT. PILOT PROGRAM IN FOUR COUNTIES WHICH WILL PROVIDE UP TO GRANTS UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER YEAR FOR A FOSTER YOUTH SB TWO NINETEEN WOULD ALLOW FOR FOSTER YOU TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES WHERE THE SCHOOL OR FOSTER PARENT. COULD NOT FULLY PAY FOR EQUIPMENT INTEREST FEES FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF ACTIVITY THIS BILL WILL ALLEVIATE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN THAT CAN HOLD FOSS YOUTH BACK FROM PARTICIPATING.

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES SB TWO ADA WILL DIRECT UTILITIES TO STREAMLINE THE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS. FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES SUCH AS ROOFTOP SOLAR AN ON SITE ENERGY STORAGE -- DISTRIBUTOR RESOURCES BENEFIT ALL CUSTOMERS NOT JUST THEIR OWNERS BY CLEANING THE AIR ENSURING THE JOB STATE LOCAL AND PROVIDING ELECTRICITY DURING EMERGENCIES AS WELL AS REDUCING THE NEED FOR COSTLY GREAT REPAIRS. IN FACT THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR RECENTLY ESTIMATED THAT CALIFORNIA REPAIRS SAVED OVER TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS ON CANCEL TRANSMISSION UPGRADES LARGELY BECAUSE OF DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES PAID FOR WITH PRIVATE DOLLARS. WERE ALREADY PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES UNFORTUNATELY AND ESPECIALLY THE COMMERCIAL LEVEL A UTILITY CAN DELAY CONNECTION OF A DISTRIBUTED RESOURCE TO THE GRID FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. COST TO THE CUSTOMERS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND WASTING TIME. BUT WITH THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE LAST COMMITTEE MOST OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- HAS WITHDRAWN AND WE EXPECT THE OTHER OPPONENTS TO BECOME NEUTRAL SHORTLY -- PASSING THIS MEASURE WILL HELP KEEP THESE PROMISING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON TRACK.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER PRESIDENT I AM I AM RISING IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY EIGHT AND I'M GONNA BE CONTRITE.

ON THE OF THE COST OF A NEW HOME AND SO FOR MORE PEOPLE MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITIES HOMEOWNERSHIP PRICES AND WAGES ARE SUCH THEY'RE SUCH A GREAT DISPARITY. THAT -- THE NEW COST OF OF HOMES WELL SIGNIFICANTLY BE A DRY DRIVEN UP BECAUSE OF THIS AND YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR BIGGER BELLAS IS REALLY SMART BECAUSE IT IGNORE ALL AGES -- THAT -- THE TOOTHPASTE IS OUT OF THE TUBE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY STORAGE ARE HAPPENING AND WE NEED TO BE WIDE OPEN ABOUT IT AND INTEGRATE THESE RESOURCES INTO THE GRID IN THE SMARTEST WAY POSSIBLE. IN FACT I THINK THE BILL SHOULD GO EVEN FURTHER AND IT SHOULD INCLUDE IN THE OUR PS ALL ROOFTOP SOLAR AN IN HOME IT. HOME ENERGY STORAGE THE COMES BACK ONTO THE GRID. OR THAT OFFSETS THE LOCAL PO USER I. O. U.'S RENEWABLE ENERGY PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS IF INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS WANT TO PAY THE COSTS FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO LAUNCH. A DISTRIBUTED ENERGY NETWORK THEN LET'S AT LEAST LEVERAGE THAT CONSUMER INVESTMENT BY TREATING SOLAR AND SOLAR WEATHER FROM FARMLAND CONVERTED TO A MORASS OF SOLAR PANELS OF OR FROM MY NEIGHBOR.

THAT CHRONICALLY SERVE CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER OR AND AND RELIABLE WATER SERVICE. IT IS AN ACCEPTABLE FOR ANY RESIDENTS IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD TO BE SERVED CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER. ONE PART OF THE PUZZLE IS TO ADDRESS GOVERNANCE ISSUES AT THE FAILING SYSTEMS AND TO ALLOW THEM TO CONSOLIDATE IN A NEW WAY. TRADITIONAL CONSOLIDATIONS OFTEN RELY ON CONTIGUOUS LARGE LARGER WATER AGENCIES TO FACILITATE A CONSOLIDATION. SB FOUR ONE FOUR PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL SOLUTION CRAFTED WITH VIGOROUS STAKEHOLDER OUT REACH THAT ALLOWS SMALL NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS EMERGE INTO A LARGER MORE ROBUST PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVED EC AKON AMIS OF SCALE STREAMLINED MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS AND ENHANCE FINANCIAL CAPACITY. THE MERGE SYSTEMS WILL BE FORMED AS AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICT AND BE PROVIDED WITH NEW INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES INCREASED TRANSPARENCY INCLUDING AN ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AND THE NEW SPECIAL DISTRICTS WILL BE SCALED TO SIZE TO SUBSTANTIALLY DEVELOP COORDINATE OUR CONTRACT FOR THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE TO TREAT THEIR CONTAMINATION ISSUES. THIS WILL LEAD TO VIABLE WATER SYSTEMS THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY DELIVER SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. SB FOUR ONE FOUR ESTABLISHES A ROAD MAP FOR CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMS WITH A DEFINED TIMELINE TO FACILITATE A CONSOLIDATION THAT BRITAIN DOES NOT RELYON IT OUR D. J.

WITH MUCH NEEDED FINANCIAL AID HOWEVER THE STATUTORY LIMITATION OF FOUR ACADEMIC YEARS OF FULL TIME ATTENDANCE. CREATES A LARGE BARRIER FOR STUDENTS WHO SEEK TO GRADUATE IN A FOUR YEAR TIME FRAME. SOMETIMES FRANKLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SIGN UP FOR NECESSARY COURSES DURING THE REGULAR ACADEMIC YEAR. AND SUMMER SCHOOL BECOMES A NECESSITY RATHER THAN AN OPTION. UNFORTUNATELY CAL GRANT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY DEDICATED FINANCIAL AID FOR SUMMER COURSES AND DRAWING DOWN AID. DIMINISHES OVERALL ELIGIBILITY. THIS BILL SENATE BILL FOUR SIX ONE WOULD FIX THIS DEMONSTRATED NEED BY EXPANDING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. TO ALLOW CAL GRANT A OR B. STUDENTS TO RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL SUMMER CAL GRANT AWARD FOR UP TO TWO SUMMER TERMS CAPTAIN NINE UNITS FOR PURPOSES OF TIMELY COMPLETION. OF A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OR AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. EXPANDING CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY TO SUMMER SESSIONS WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO AFFORD SUMMER COURSES REDUCE THEIR FINANCIAL BURDEN. AND GRADUATE IN A FASTER TIME FRAME WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT. WE'RE WORKING TO SECURE APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET COLLEAGUES. OUR STUDENTS CANNOT BE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IF THEY CANNOT GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- MEMBERS. THIS BILL SB FORTY FIVE PROHIBITS THE SUSPENSION OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE. FOR NON VEHICLE RELATED CRIMES SUSPENDING A DRIVER'S LICENSE BECAME A POPULAR METHOD OF PUNISHMENT IN THE NINETIES WHETHER OR NOT A CRIME HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH OPERATING A VEHICLE. THIS DOES NOT INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY AND ONLY DETERS A PERSON'S ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN. MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND PAY RESTITUTION. PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS DEPEND ON ABOUT HAVING A VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE. 78% OF CALIFORNIANS DRIVE TO WORK. OVER FIVE MILLION JOBS IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRE A VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE. SUSPENSION FOR NON VEHICLE RELATED CRIMES LEADS TO INCARCERATION FINES. FEES IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ALL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND COMMUNITY CALLER -- I ALSO WANT TO MENTION WOMEN. BECAUSE WHEN I VISITED THE WOMEN'S SHELTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- THE WOMEN HAD THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENDED -- UNDER THESE CODES THAT WE HAVE. FLORIDA PASSED A BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO END THE SUSPENSIONS FOR NON VEHICLE RELATED CRIMES. I URGE CALIFORNIA DO THE SAME -- THIS ELIMINATES AN INEFFICIENT UNNECESSARY WORKLOAD.

EIGHT THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION TO REMOVE SOMEONE'S DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR PURCHASING A HUMAN BEING FOR SEX -- IT'S GOING TO ADDRESS HUMAN TRAFFICKING A JUDGE IS NOT GOING TO HAVE DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE THAT PERSON'S DRIVER'S LICENSE. SOMEBODY WHO IS -- LIKE I SAID EARLIER PURCHASING A FEMALE FOR SEX WILL NOT HAVE THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE BE ABLE TO BE REMOVED. THERE ARE A LOT OF INSTANCES IN CODE SECTIONS WERE JUDGES WILL PUTATIVELY PUNISH SOMEONE THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A VIOLATION FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE CODE BUT IT ALSO DOES DO TOUR PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO. ACCORDING TO THE LAW SO I WOULD ASK FEAR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

FIREARMS WITH THE AL LEGALLY BEING REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE SO HERE COMES THE JUDGE. THERE IS A DISPARITY IN THE PENAL CODES DEFINITION OF THE TERM INFREQUENT WHICH RESULTS IN THE DISPARITY IN A WAY IN WHICH I'M LICENSED SELLERS OF FIREARMS ARE TREATED UNDER THE LAW. INDIVIDUALS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE TO SELL FIREARMS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF FIREARM BEING TRANSACTED IN SOME INSTANCES THIS MAY EXEMPT FOR EXAMPLE NON PROFITS. FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH A LICENSED DEALER ONE RAFFLE YOUR AUCTIONING OFF A FIREARM THIS DISPARATE TREATMENT CAUSES CONFUSION AND MAKES UNCLEAR IF AND WHEN SELLERS ARE REQUIRED. TO AND SHOULD OBTAIN A LICENSE TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS F TRANSACTION FIREARMS THIS IS A PROBLEM BOTH FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE THERE'S A BLACK OF A BRIGHT LINE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO STANDARDIZE THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM INFREQUENT IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY. AND NUMBER OF FIREARMS AN INDIVIDUAL IS ALLOWED TO SELL OR MANUFACTURE ANNUALLY WITHOUT A LICENSE THE BILL CREATES A SINGLE LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS ON ON LICENSE INDIVIDUAL IS AFFORDED IN A YEAR REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM BEING TRANSACTED. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHERE TRANSACTIONS MAY BE A MIXTURE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF FIREARMS THE BILL ALSO LIMITS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FIREARMS INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO SELL LEASE OR TRANSFER TO NO MORE THAN. FIFTY PER YEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN A LICENSE THAT JUST SEEMS COMMONSENSE YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING MASS -- FIREARM TRANSACTION SHE SHOULD HAVE A LICENSE AT MINIMUM AND WITH ONLY UP TO FIVE SEPARATE TRAY THIS ACTION INDIVIDUALS REQUIRED TO ATTAIN THIS LICENSE IF THEY ARE SELLING LEASING TRANSFERRING OUR MANUFACTURING MORE THAN FIFTY FIREARMS A YEAR. CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE TO INSTITUTE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THESE CONNECTICUT REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL SELLING MORE THAN TEN HAND GUNS TO GET A LICENSE MASSACHUSETTS GENERALLY REQUIRES ANY INDIVIDUAL SELLING OR LEASING A FIREARM.

A PRODUCT OF YEARS OF NEGLECT. THE CHECKING IN TESTING AND MAINTENANCE. SAME THINGS HAPPEN WITH OUR CONVEYANCE SYSTEM. FOR WATER IN CALIFORNIA. PRIDE KERN CANALS DELIVERS WATER FROM THE EASTERN WATERSHED. INTO THE VALLEY. IN THE CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS ALSO DETERIORATE. THE CONVEYANCE OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT.

THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO THINK THAT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SINGER -- FOR PROPOSING THIS BILL THIS IS A AN EXISTING FACILITY THAT IT REALLY HAS BECOME DETERIORATED OVER THE YEARS. BECAUSE OF SUBSIDENCE WHICH IS CREATED WHEN -- WHEN WATER IS EXTRACTED FROM -- UNDERNEATH THE SOIL. AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IF WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO FARM AND TO PROVIDE WATER FOR THE FARM WORKER FAMILIES THAT LIVE. IN THIS REGION THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING THAT TO BE ABLE TO FIX THIS -- THIS PARTICULAR CAN NOW AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AND SAY WE NEED A PARTNRSHIP. WE NEED A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE LOCAL LAND OWNERS BECAUSE THE THE ENTIRE REGION IS AFFECTED BY THE SUBSIDENCE OF THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY AND SO I WANT. TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF A BEST AND AND AND URGED OF THE SENATE TODAY TO PASS THIS OFF SO WE CAN GET IT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. SENATOR GROW. THINKING THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT IS AN HONOR TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL BECAUSE ON JUST BECAUSE OF ECHOING THE COMMENTS THAT ALL OF THE VALLEY PEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE CONSTITUENTS IN THE AREA. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SINGER HAD A BILL EARLIER ABOUT WATER TANKS IN BRINGING A SAFE QUALITY DRINKING WATER IN SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE JUST LIVING LIKE THEY'RE IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY AND THIS. THIS CANAL -- WITH THE SUBSIDENCE HAS BEEN DAMAGED FOR A LONG TIME AND TO HAVE THIS FIXED AND REPAIRED WILL DELIVER THAT WATER QUALITY THAT WE NEED FOR CONSTITUENTS SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE. I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD VITALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR.

BUT IN THIS CASE A BIG GAP IS NECESSARY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT JUST A YOU KNOW AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE ON THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS CANAL ON HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.

IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE STATE HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR FREIGHT FEDERAL ISSUES AS WE'RE DOING AND SO MANY AREAS OF THE STATE THIS IS SOMETHING NEEDS TO GET FIXED.

COMPELLED UPON MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES. TO TO KEEP THIS MEASURE MOVING ALONG AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF FEDERAL ACTION IN FACT. IN MY VIEW A DERELICTION OF DUTY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO MAINTAIN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT SUBSIDIZING THEIR BOTTOM LINE. WE GIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO THE FEDS AS TAXPAYERS IN THIS STATE -- AND YOU KNOW I WASN'T GOING TO RISE AND SPEAK TODAY BUT I'M I'M COMPELLED TO RAISE THAT ISSUE BECAUSE THERE IS A FARM BILL MOVING THROUGH CONGRESS. THERE ARE PLENTY OF RESOURCES FEDERALLY THAT WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN THEM FROM OUR TAX DOLLARS. SO I STILL REMAIN CONCERNED. ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP HI I UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO NEED A PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK THAT PARTNERSHIP GOING TO BE KEY BUT SO FAR I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WILLING TO PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA.

NEXT UP IS ITEM SEVENTY SENATOR STERN ARE YOU PREPARED. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY SIX BY SENATOR STERN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS. SOONER STERN. FAMOUS PRESIDENT MEMBERS. OUR BALLOT PAMPHLETS ARE PACKED WITH USEFUL INFORMATION BUT FOR MANY VOTERS A NINETY SIX PAGE DOCUMENT. WHICH IS THE LENGTH OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT PAMPHLET CAN BE OVERWHELMING. ULTIMATELY HIDING MORE THAN IT ACTUALLY REVEALS. WE NEED TO MAKE OUR ELECTIONS ACCESSIBLE WHICH MEANS PUTTING THE MOST CRITICAL INFORMATION FRONT AND CENTER. CURRENTLY PUT WE PUT. BRIEF SUMMARY TITLE AND A FISCAL ANALYSIS ON THE LABEL BUT A CRITICAL PIECE OF INFORMATION IS MISSING. THE OFFICIAL SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. THAT'S WHY SB SIX THIRTY SIX WOULD MODIFY BALLOT MEASURE LABELS TO INCLUDE THE OFFICIAL SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION OF BALLOT MEASURES. KNOWING THE MAJOR GROUPS ON EACH SIDE OF AN ISSUE IS A CRITICAL TOOL VOTERS CAN USE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. PUTTING OFFICIALS SUPPORT ON THE BALLOT ALSO HELPS A ROAD THE ELUSIVE POWER OF DARK MONEY IN OUR POLITICS. INSTEAD OF HIDING DEEP IN THE PAGES OF A PAMPHLET. THE PROPONENTS OF AN OP AND OPPONENTS OF THE MEASURE SHOULD BE AS CLEAR AS DAY. TO CITIZEN CASTING THEIR VOTE. WE TAKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH THE CONCERNS ABOUT TRYING TO PACK TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND ADDING LINKS. TO AN ALREADY LIKE THE BALLOT. THAT'S WHY SB SIX THIRTY SIX WAS WRITTEN TO TAKE MINIMAL ADDITIONAL SPACE ON THE BALLOT COMPARED TO CURRENT LAW ONLY THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT SIGNED ABOUT ARGUMENT IS LISTED. NOT ALSO THE NAME OF THE PERSON REPRESENT ANY ORGANIZATION SO ABBREVIATIONS LIKE CALIFORNIA OR CERTAIN TO CA AND IT INDIVIDUAL NAMES ARE LISTED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. EXCEPT THE OFFICE THAT THEY HOLD IF THEY'RE KERN ELECTED OFFICIAL. RECENT AMENDMENTS MAKE SURE THAT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WORDS PERMITTED FOR SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION IS STILL LIMITED TO FIFTEEN PER SIDE. WHICH GUARANTEES THAT THIS WILL CREATE A LINK TO YOUR CUMBERSOME ADDITION TO THE BALLOT. MEMBERS KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. AND THIS DISCLOSURE MEASURE WOULD BE COMMONSENSE. AND EMPOWER VOTERS TO FULFILL A CITIZENS MOST SACRED OBLIGATION THE RIGHT TO VOTE WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX THREE SIX FAR TOO OFTEN. THE BALLOT IMAGE MEASURES HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OR OTHER AND IT AND IT CONFUSES THE VOTERS I BELIEVE THE MORE INFORMATION ACCURATE INFORMATION THE VOTERS GET THE BETTER CHOICE ARE GOING TO MAKE. I THINK THIS IS A SMART -- COMMONSENSE REFORM THAT'S GOING TO SERVE AS A GUIDE POST -- TO TO VOTERS AND SO I'M A STRONG. NINE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU IN ADDITION IT'S DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING SHE NINE SOONER STERN SELECT CLOTHES YES THANK YOU TO THE CENTER FOR SANTA CLARITA AND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT MEASURE NOT JUST FOR LIBERALS OR CONSERVATIVES BUT FOR INDEPENDENCE AND ANYBODY ELSE.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE REFER READ. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SEVEN BY SENATOR MINING AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU I MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. THREE FORTY SEVEN WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE A PART OF A BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY. A CAMPAIGN THAT SEEKS TO LIMIT. THE HEART THE KNOWN HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. MANY OF YOU PRIVATELY ASKED ME WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AGAIN. YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE WELL. THE EPIDEMIC CONTINUES. AND I DON'T USE THE WORD EPIDEMIC IS HYPERBOLE. I USE THE WORD EPIDEMIC AS USED BY PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS. THERE IS A NATIONAL. EPIDEMIC. OF PRE DIABETES SOME PREVENTABLE TYPE TWO DIABETES. SO WHY IS THAT LINK TO SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE SINGLE LEADING SOURCE INCREASED BAD CALORIES THAT ARE BEING. PROMOTED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND PUSH ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR. AT EVR LOWER RATES -- FOR FAMILIES WITH TOUGH FOOD BUDGETS. THE MARKETING OF THESE PRODUCTS. IT BECOMES A STAPLE IN THE DIET. NOT A WEEKEND TO TREAT THE EPIDEMIC. OF SKYRIM SKYROCKETING SKYROCKETING RATES OF PREVENTABLE DIABETES. IS PROVEN IN MEDICAL ARTICLES FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO. ON THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL YALE THE RED INSTITUTE. THE SCIENCE IS AN CONSERVE CONTROVERSIAL. NOW SOME OF THE OPPONENTS SAY. WELL THERE'S DATA THAT SHOWS A DECREASE IN THE CONSUMPTION OF SODAS. BUT A CONTINUED INCREASE IN PREVENTABLE DIABETES. THEIR THEIR PART RIGHT. THE DECREASE IN SODA CONSUMPTION IS BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN CAMOUFLAGED. IS HELPFUL DRINKS FORTIES ANARCHY DRINKS THAT ARE BEING PUSHED IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH EQUAL AMOUNTS OR MORE SUGAR. THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE WARNING LABEL. LET ME JUST MENTION SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN. COMING OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS THAT I THINK HELP STREAMLINE THE BILL IN EASE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF BURDENS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL. AS AMENDED THE BILL EXEMPTS MILK PRODUCTS -- AND WE'VE SEEN THE REMOVAL OF OPPOSITION FROM THE AG INDUSTRY THE DAIRY INDUSTRY THE ALMOND INDUSTRY. WE'VE ALSO MADE IT EASIER FOR POSTING THE LABEL ON VENDING MACHINES TO ONLY HAVE TO OCCUR AT THE TIME THE CONTRACT ON THAT VENDING MACHINE IS RENEWED OR THE VENDING MACHINE IS SWITCHED OUT. AND AT THE RESTAURANT LEVEL WE REQUIRE SINGLE POSTING. THE REAL FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER THE TWO LITER BOTTLE IT IS BEING SOLD LESS. FOR AN AMOUNT LESS THAN AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MILK OR WATER. FRIENDS THIS IS NOT THE INVENTION OF POLITICIANS. THIS IS THE REALITY CONFIRMED BY DOCTORS AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES THAT'S WHY THERE'S SUCH A STRONG COALITION OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES FROM DOCTORS DENTISTS. TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TO COACHES TO THE PTA. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON IS THIS VAST SOLUTION. NO. IS IT PART OF A BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY. TO RAISE AWARENESS AND TO PROVIDE IN INFORMATION. NOW IN THE PAST WITH BILLS TO PUT A TAX ON SODAS THE INDUSTRY'S RESPONSE RESPONDED TO THAT CALL. IN THE LABEL WARNING IS JUST THAT IT'S EDUCATION. IT'S CONSUMER RIGHT TO KNOW. IF DOCTORS KNOW IT'S BAD FOR YOU SHOULDN'T WE GIVE PARENTS. THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE INFORMED CHOICE AND AGAIN SOME SAY WELL EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SO IT IS NOT HELPFUL BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CAMOUFLAGE DRINKS. THE ONES THAT ARE STILL ON OUR SCHOOLS. UNDER GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S LEADERSHIP WE GOT SO IT IS OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS. BUT THE SPORT TEASE THE ENERGY DRINKS THE GATORADE. THEY'VE REPLACED IT AND THEY'RE LOADED WITH SUGARS AND THEY WOULD ALSO CARRY. THE LABEL THE LABEL IS DESIGNED TO INFORM CHOICE. WE DON'T TAKE ANYTHING OFF THE SHELVES. WE DON'T RESTRICT THE SALE. WE SIMPLY SAY LET'S GIVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE. OTHERS SAY WILL THE LABELS THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT AFFECTED PEOPLE IGNORE THE LABELS. WHERE THEY SAY WELL THE CALORIC CONTEXTS? CONTENTS ALREADY THERE IN THE BACK OF THE BOTTLE IN THE SMALL PRINT [inaudible] WHAT FRIENDS? BUT THE WARNING LABEL HAS BEEN PROVEN TO DO BY MEDICAL STUDIES PEER REVIEWED STUDIES ONE WITH. TWO THOUSAND ADOLESCENT TEENAGE KIDS WHERE THEY HAD A CONTROL GROUP THAT CHOSE BEVERAGES ON THE SHELF. AND THEN THEY PUT LABEL WARNINGS. AND 10% OUT OF TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE. MORE INFORMED BY THAT LABEL WARNING. IN MADE A HEALTHFUL CHOICE. YOU SAY WE'LL TO HUNDREDS NOT THAT MANY OUT OF TWO THOUSAND IF IT'S YOUR CHILD IF IT'S YEAR COMMUNITY. THAT'S A START. MANY OF YOU WERE SUPPORT OF LAST YEAR ON THE CHILDREN'S MENU. WE HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THAT THE FALL OPTION MILK OR WATER. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORT A PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. TO GIVE THEM THE POWER OF INFORMED CHOICE IT'S NOT MANY GOVERNMENT. IT'S CONSUMER PROTECTION IT'S AN FORMING CHOICE. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DEBATE OUR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU -- THAT MISTER PRESIDENT -- SENATORS I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY -- I THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM CARMEL FOR BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD WE ARE SEEING -- ARISING RIGHTS -- RATES OF DIABETES PARTICULARLY TIED. TWO ALMOST ALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PRE DIABETIC WHICH MEANS AT RISK FOR DIABETES. AND WHILE CERTAINLY SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ARE NOT THE ONLY POTENTIAL SOURCE IT CERTAINLY IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR. AND SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS. HEALTH CRISIS -- I THINK OF FORMING CONSUMERS ABOUT THE VARIETY DIFFERENT DRINKS THAT MAY FALL UNDER IS I THINK IS THAT LIKE IT'S GOOD AUTHOR SAID IT'S PEOPLE MAY RECOGNIZE SODA HE OTHER NIGHT I WAS -- ALWAYS AWARE BUT THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE NAY THE OTHER ONES SO AGAIN I WOULD STAND IN SUPPORT THIS BILL I WOULD SAY PEACE BABY VOTE FOR THE BILL [inaudible] ENTER WIENER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH LEGISLATION I WANT TO THANK -- OF THE SENATOR -- THE AUTHOR FOR ON HIS -- TENACIOUS ADVOCACY. NOT JUST ON THE WARNING LABEL ISSUE BUT ON THIS GENERAL -- ISSUE. THIS -- THIS IS INFORMATION. FOR PEOPLE. I'D JUST LIKE WE REQUIRE HEALTH WARNINGS ON CIGARETTE PACKS. PEOPLE NEED TO BE WARNED -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IN THESE DRINKS ONE TWELVE OUNCE CAN OF SODA. HAS ABOUT TEN TEASPOONS OF SUGAR AND AT THIS IS NOT JUST LIKE WHAT IS A LITTLE SUGAR IN THEIR WORK TO HELP PEOPLE. THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN THESE DRINKS IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE HEAR A RESPONSE WELL WHY ARE YOU PUTTING MORNINGS ON ON COOKIES ARE CAKES. LIQUID SUGAR IS UNIQUELY HARMFUL TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH. LIQUID SUGAR IS MUCH MORE QUICKLY ABSORBED INTO YOUR LIVER LEADING THE FATTY LIVER DISEASE WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS TO DIABETES AND OTHER METABOLIC PROBLEMS. AND UNLIKE EATING WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING LIQUID SUGAR -- YOUR BODY YOUR APPETITE NEVER RECEIVED THE TO THE SINGLE TO TURN OFF. SO YOU CAN DRINK. AN ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF LIQUID SUGAR WITH AL EVEN. HAVING YOUR HUNGER TURN OFF UNLIKE WHEN YOU ARE EATING SOMETHING. SO THIS IS A UNIQUELY HARMFUL PRODUCTS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CONTRIBUTING TO THE EXPLOSION OF TYPE TWO DIABETES INCLUDING AMONG CHILDREN. TYPE TWO DIABETES USED TO BE A DISEASE THAT WE ASSOCIATED WITH AGING CHILDREN ARE NOW GETTING THIS DISEASE. AND THIS PRODUCT THESE PRODUCTS OR A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AND WE NEED TO HAVE THESE HEALTH WARNINGS THANK YOU SKINNER MORLOCK. THANK YOU IT'S PRESIDENT THIS BILLS ABOUT BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THE INITIATIVE SHOULD BE DONE ON A NATIONAL BASIS NOT ON JUST A CALIFORNIA BASIS -- AND MAKING CALIFORNIA NOT LINER A LIAR WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR BUSINESSES THAT SELL PRODUCTS [inaudible] NATIONALLY. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF BUSINESSES JUST TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND DO IT ON THEIR OWN -- WE WERE WOULDN'T BECOMING AN ADDED BURDEN OR COSTS BUT I THINK COLLEAGUES SAID -- MAKING CALIFORNIA OUT WHY YOU'RE UNIQUE AND THEN. MAKING ANOTHER COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE IS MAYBE SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT AND FOR THAT REASON -- I'M. LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT SB. THREE FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE ON SEEN ON SENATOR MINING WHICH LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE -- THE INDULGENCE THE ENGAGEMENT THAT I'VE HAD WITH MANY OF YOU. ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS CONCERNS -- I APPRECIATE THOSE WHO. EMBRACE THESE EFFORTS IF I COULD JUST COMMENT ON A CUT -- THE LAST COMMENT -- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM TEMECULA NO THAT'S TO MAKE KILLER THAT SOME. THANK YOU ORANGE COUNTY. ABOUT CALIFORNIA BEING IN OUT LIAR -- THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS LET'S MAKE CALIFORNIA LEADER. OFTEN. OUR NATIONAL POLITICS LOOK TO CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ALSO INCLUDES PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION THIS BILL IS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION -- OTHERS IN THE OPPOSITION OF SAID WHY DO YOU PICK. ON THESE PRODUCTS WHEN THEIR SUGAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS -- IS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO INDICATED SCIENCE HAS PROVEN NOT POLITICIANS THAT LIQUID SUGAR IS ABSORBED. MORE RAPIDLY IT'S CONVERTED TO FAT BY THE KIDNEYS AND PANCREAS -- WEARS SUGAR IN FOODS WELL WE DON'T ENCOURAE THAT CONSUMPTION EITHER -- IT'S DIGESTED DIFFERENTLY. FRIENDS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN KNOWS IN OUR COMMUNITIES COR WORK FOR WORKING TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE. THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES SOME OF OUR MOST AT RISK COMMUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY ARE THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST TARGETED. FOR THE PROMOTION. IN SALE OF SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS. AND ALL JUST CLOSE MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS. BY SAYING IMAGINE THERE'S NO CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTABLE DIABETES OR TOOTH DECAY. IT'S EASY IF YOU TRY. IMAGINE WE TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTH. IT'S EASY IF YOU TRY. A MANSION COMMUNITIES WHERE HEALTH PROMOTION TAKES PRIORITY. OVER THE TREATMENT OF ILLNESS AND DISEASE. IT'S EASY IF YOU TRY. YOU MAY SAY I'M A DREAMER. BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY. ONE I HOPE SOME DAY YOU'LL JOIN US. IN PRIORITIZE OUR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. OVER THE MONEY OF THE BIG ONES THANK YOU.

TWENTY FIVE BY SENATOR CAFIERO AUG [inaudible] TWENTY FOURTEENTH OUR HIGHLY. FOURTEEN SENATE BILL TWENTY FIVE BY SENATOR CABALLERO AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. SENATOR COVER YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT. MEMBERS FOR FOR THOSE OF NOTE THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME HEY HOW YOU UNDERSTAND MY BACKGROUND AND AND WHY I HAVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WORKING ON SB -- TWENTY FIVE I BECAME AN ATTORNEY BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK WITH. WORKING FAMILIES AND I MOVED TO SALINAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK WITH FARMWORKERS. AND I ENDED UP IN POLITICS FOR THE SAME REASON. I WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES IN IN. IN IN PARTICULAR FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS GOOD JOBS. I BURKE TO BUILD RESILIENCY AND HER PURSE COMMUNITIES. BY CHANGING THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVE WORK AND PLAY. AND THAT'S ELECTED AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE REGULARLY HERE FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT PERVASIVE POVERTY AND HARDSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITIES. POVERTY THAT RESULTS FROM THE LACK OF LOCAL GOOD PAYING JOBS. POVERTY THAT TAKES AWAY AMBITION AND HOPE. AND POVERTY THAT LEADS TO RESIGNATION THAT THINGS. HAVE NO CHANCE TO IMPROVE. SB TWENTY FIVE CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR GREEN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. FOR CRITICAL HOUSING STATEWIDE AND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. IT IS A MODEST ATTEMPT TO JOIN FORCES WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT. DESIGNED TO FINAL AN ESTIMATED SIX TRILLION DOLLARS FROM CAPITAL GAINS EARNING INTO AMERICA'S POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS TAX INCENTIVE. WAS THE BRAIN CHILD OF TWO AUTHORS. ON WHO PUT IT INTO THE FEDERAL TAX TAX CREDIT BILL. SENATOR CORY BOOKER FROM NEW JERSEY AND SENATOR TIM CAUGHT SCOTT -- BOTH WHO ARE LONG TIME FIGHTER FIGHTERS FOR THE POOR. HERE'S THE FRAMEWORK. SB TWENTY FIVE ATTACKS POVERTY IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. BY CREATING MARKET CONDITIONS FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO REACH COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY CHRONIC POVERTY. IT MAKES CALIFORNIA'S POOREST AREAS ATTRACTIVE FOR OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUND INVESTMENT WITHOUT COMMITTING A DOLLAR OF LOCAL OR STATE FUNDS. THE LACK OF ACCESS TO INVESTMENT CAPITALS HEAPS POOR PEOPLE POOR. PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUNDS WILL CLOSE IN. TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO THERE IS A VERY SHORT WINDOW TO TAP INTO A SIX TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET A PRIVATE INVESTMENT. AND SB TWENTY FIVE CARRIES A FIVE YEAR SUNSET DATE. SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES. IT SETS THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS FOR QUALITY PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH REQUIRE THAT ALL CONSTRUCTION BE CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL GENERAL PLANS. ZONING CODES AND IT REQUIRES LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION. IT REQUIRES ZERO NET ENERGY. AND IT REQUIRES ZERO NET GHG. NONE OF OUR PROJECTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REQUIRE THIS AS A AS A FUNCTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT. SB TWENTY FIVE PROTECTS AGAINST COMMUNITY GENTRIFICATION AND DESPITE DISPLACEMENT. BY REQUIRING UP 275% OF THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE IN MIXED USE PROJECTS BE DEDICATED TO HOUSING. AND A MINIMUM OF 40% OF THE UNITS BEING AFFORDABLE. WITH A THIRTY YEAR AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS. SB TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES A TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND CREATE NEW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN IN THE GREEN BUILDING TRADES WHICH IS A SKILL SET THAT THE STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS. IT ENSURES THAT THE LABOR FORCE IS FAIRLY COMPENSATED. WITH PREVAILING WAGE. AND REQUIRES LEADING AGENCIES TO GO THROUGH THE EXACT SAME DECISION PROCESS REGARDING THE pTODAY. SO THERE ARE NO CHANGES. IT DOESN'T CHANGE. SEQUOIA IT IS NOT AN EXEMPTION LET ME REPEAT. THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL EXEMPTION. AND IT DOES NOT ALTER A SINGLE ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION UNDERSEA C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</u> SB TWENTY FIVE DOES ONLY ONE THING. IT GIVES PROJECTS IN THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES AND HOUSING PROJECTS FINANCED WITH TAX PAYERS MONEY. CERTAINTY THAT THE PROJECT WILL NOT BE UNDULY BURDENED WITH NIMBY LITIGATION. SB TWENTY FIVE DOES THIS BY SIMPLY REQUIRING THAT IF LITIGATION IS FILED. COURTS ARE TO REACH A FINAL DISPOSITION WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS OR AS SOON THERE AFTER AS FEASIBLE. SB TWENTY FIVE WILL DISCOURAGE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS WILL KNOW. THEY ARE CHALLENGING PROJECTS THAT ARE ABOUT ALREADY MET IN IN CREEK CREDIBLY HIGH PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARD. AND THAT THE SUITS WILL BE RESOLVED IN A TIMELY MANNER UNABLE TO KILL THE PROJECT JUST BY CAUSING UNDUE DELAY. SB TWENTY FIVE ALSO CREATES A MULTIPLIER PLAYER EFFECT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS FOR OPPORTUNITIES OWNS CLEARLY SET OUT IN THE MAY BUDGET REVISED WHERE THE GOVERNOR ALLOCATE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION IN THE INFO INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND DEVELOPERS THAT PARTNER TOGETHER TO BUILD CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPOSE SUPPORT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO LOOKING TO MAKE THE AYE BANK MORE EFFICIENT TO SPUR OPPORTUNITIES ON DEVELOPMENT. AND SB TWENTY FIVE WILL HOPE TO ENSURE THE PROJECT WITH I BEING FUNDING. DO NOT DIE IN LITIGATION PURGATORY. THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IN ADDITION TO HOUSING AND THAT IS WHY THE GOVERNOR SEEKS TO INCENTIVIZE GREEN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS. IN THESE COMMUNITIES WITH STATE TAX CREDIT CONFORMITY. TO THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. THIS COULD GENERATE BILLIONS OF NEW REVENUE THAT WILL BE MATCHED WITH THE INFLUX INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. SB TWENTY FIVE AMPLIFIES THE ADMINISTRATION'S OPPORTUNE OPPORTUNITIES OWN PLANS AND MAKES CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE FOR THIS PIVATE CAPITAL THAT ARE POOR COMMUNITIES DESPERATELY NEED. PRIVATE INVESTORS COULD INCLUDE WEALTHY INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALS BUT IT ALSO COULD INCLUDE PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS MEANING THE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS COULD VERY WELL BE INVESTORS IN OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUNDS. THAT COULD HELP TO REBUILD CALIFORNIA'S POOREST COMMUNITIES. I AM COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE HOUSING SUPPLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO BRING AFFORDABILITY TO THE HOUSING MARKET. I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO TACKLING DECADES OF INSUFFERABLE POVERTY FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE CENSUS TRACKS THAT ARE CALIFORNIA'S POOREST HOUSING AND JOB POOR COMMUNITIES. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS OPPORTUNITY ZONES I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION HERE TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES THANK YOU A MISS PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES WHILE I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS AND THE DESIRES ARTICULATED BY THE AUTHOR THIS BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT BASICALLY IS JUST GOING TO BLOW UP SEQUEL. IT TALKS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY ZONES WHICH COULD BE ALMOST ANYTHING SO IF WE'RE PREPARED TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TURN INTO MIAMI BEACH. THAN VOTE FOR THIS BILL. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THE PROBLEM THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS AND THERE IS A PROBLEM. IS NOT. THROUGH SEQUEL. WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU START PRIORITIZING THESE. THESE BILLS AND FAST TRACKED THEM THAT OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THE STATES FOR THE COURTS. BECOME SECONDARY. WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL MALPRACTICE OR ELDER ABUSE OR A RESTRAINING ORDERS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES THEY'RE ALL GOING TO GET PUSHED BACK. OPPORTUNITIES JONES AS I MENTIONED ARE COULD BE ANYTHING WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A LIMITED HOUSING TRACT. OPPORTUNITY ZONES MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE -- CREATING THIS FAST TRACK IGNORING SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS REMEMBER. SEE QUIRK IS THE ONLY. PLANNING. THE VICE. THAT IS THE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT. THAT'S WHAT SEE WHAT IS. THAT IS THE ONLY CONSIDERATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT COMES UNDER SEQUEL. WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS WE ARE GOING TO IGNORE OR WE ARE GOING TO CIRCUMVENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS? AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE NEEDS IN THE STATE. TO GET RID OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS RUNS CONTRARY I BELIEVE TO THE WILL OF CALIFORNIANS. SO. WHILE I APPRECIATE WE HAVE WORK TO DO. TWO OF THIS CHARADE SEQUEL IS SIMPLY NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO IN WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. ORIGIN OVERLOOKED. SENATOR ALSO. YES -- TO MY SENT -- SENATOR FROM SALINAS. MY CONCERNS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA RAISED AN YESTERDAY I VOTED FOR A BILL. THAT DID MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR SEQUEL. UP BECAUSE IT WAS VERY IN MY OPINION NARROW AND IT WAS FOCUSED. THIS IS WAY WAY BEYOND THAT. THIS IS ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES ZONES AND WHEN I FIRST LOOKED. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS FOR HOUSING. BUT AS WE LOOK MORE INTO IT AS I DID. I REALIZE THIS IS FOR EVERY SINGLE KIND OF PROJECT IN EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITIES OWN. THAT IS I THINK GOING. PAST THE LINE AND I BELIEVE THAT IN YOUR HEART YOU ARE REALLY DOING THIS FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS WE HAVE TO DO MORE DRAMATIC THINGS. BUT I THINK TAKING IN AWAY. THIS AS A PROTECTION FOR OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE POOR COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFER. ENORMOUSLY FROM CONTAMINATION AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM POOR COMMUNITIES IS ALSO A DIS SERVICE TO THEM. I WAS I REMEMBER I LED. UP PIECE OF LEGISLATION YEARS AGO WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME. THAT WE DID DO AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW ON A PROJECT OF OF SEQUEL -- AND I BELIEVE VERY MUCH THAT THERE IS A PLACE AND A TIME TO DO THAT. UP BUT I UNDER UNFORTUNATELY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS TRYING TO COVER EVERYTHING TOO MUCH. AND EVERYTHING FROM STADIUMS AND HOTELS. TO SOME HOUSING YOU NAME IT AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TOO FAR THANK YOU. SENATOR WHY BECAUSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I A TO RISE IN OPPOSITION I WAS A NO VOTE IN VIRAL CALL THE IN A NO VOTE IN A JUDICIARY I DO WANT.

AUGUST TWENTY SEVEN NO SIX THE MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS NEXT REMOVING CHIU FILE ITEM. FIFTEEN BY SENATOR GLAZER SB SIX TWO ONE MOUNT SECRETARY PLEASE RATE. SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY ONE BY SENATOR GLAZER AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. CENTER GLAZER THANK THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS. SB SIX TWENTY ONE WOULD PROVIDE JUDICIAL STREAMLINING. TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT MEET CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. THIS BILL WOULD DO FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE IN THE SENATE. FOR BILLIONAIRES IN THEIR SPORTS ARENAS. AND EVEN FOR OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE PARKING STRUCTURE. DURING HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS GOVERNOR NEWSOME SAID QUOTE IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW ONE SEQUEL FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. IT'S TIME WE DO THE SAME THING FOR HOUSING. SB A SIX TWENTY ONE GETTING BACK TO MY WORDS FINALLY DOES JUST THAT. AS WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS DEBATE THE CALIFORNIA VINYL QUALITY ACT IS THE HALLMARK OF CALIFORNIA'S DEDICATION TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. AND OUR STATE'S BROADEST ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. THIS BILL OF HOLDS ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND REVIEWS AND SYKORA. DOES NOT LIMIT THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO OBJECT TO PROJECTS UNDER SYKORA. TOWARDS A GRANT ANY NEW EXEMPTION. THE SEQUEL. PROCESS OF PUBLIC INPUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND THE ABILITY TO CHALLENGE A PROJECT. ALL REMAIN INTACT. THIS BILL SIMPLY ESTABLISHES A SET PERIOD IN WHICH A COURT OVERSEEING A SECRET CHALLENGE. ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT MUST BE COMPLETED. IN FACT THIS BILL ADDS A HIGHER STANDARD FOR THOSE PROJECTS UNDER SB SIX TWENTY ONE THOSE PROJECTS MUST BE INFILL PROJECTS CLOSE TO MAJOR TRANSIT. AND NEED THE EQUIVALENT OF A LEAD GOLD STANDARD. REGARD TO PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. DEVELOPERS HAVE TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF 30% OF THE PROJECT AS AFFORDABLE. AND THEY MUST AGREED WITH THIRTY YEAR AFFORDABILITY COMMITMENT. AND OF COURSE THEY CANNOT BUILD ON LAND DESIGNATED AS HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS. THERE CONTINUES TO BE DISCUSSIONS IN THIS BILL WAS STAKEHOLDERS. INCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE OF COMMERCIAL ELEMENTS IN AFFORDABLE PROJECTS TO MAKE THEM. FEASIBLE TO ACTUALLY CONSTRUCT. STREAMLINING PROCESS CREATED BY SB SIX TWENTY ONE CREATES MORE LEGAL CERTAINLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. WILL ADVANCING THE KIND OF PROJECTS STATE IS FOUND TO BE INCLUSIVE AND SAFE. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A COALITION HOUSING ADVOCATES NONPROFITS AND BUSINESS GROUPS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SOONER ACOSTA. MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THE MEASURE -- THE SIX THIS THIS MEASURE VOTED NO IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND ALSO AN ISSUE ONCE AGAIN THIS TAKES. A BIG JUMP ON ALL HOUSING PROJECTS THAT GO THROUGH THE SECRET PROCESS YOU KNOW WE'VE SAID TIME AND AGAIN THAT THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY THAT THE PUBLIC CAST OBJECT. TO THAT THE PROJECT IS TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE FORCING EVERY HOUSING PROJECT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A FINAL JUDICIAL DETERMINATION IN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS IS JUST. WHO DO JUSTICE WE DON'T AND THE COURTS CANNOT POSSIBLY GET THROUGH THE DAY THE DETAIL OF OF INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S A NEGATIVE DECK WARRANTY AYE AYE COMPLETE E. R. R. TAKES SPLIT EXPECT THEM TO DO THIS ON EVERY HOUSING? PROJECT IS JUST TOO MUCH HI BUT DON'T -- A QUESTION THAT THE AUTHORS DETERMINATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS BUT THIS IS JUST SIMPLY NOT THE WAY. TO DO IT OUR COURTS ARE GOING TO GET CRUSHED UNDER THIS AND I REGION I VOEPEL NOVO. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF IT ON THE SIDE OF SENATOR JACKSON. YES -- NOT TO BELABOR THE POINT WE'LL KEEP ON TRUCKIN BUT THIS BILL. APPLIES INSTANCES IN THE ANALYSIS TO AN UNKNOWN. NUMBER OF FUTURE PROJECTS WITH UNKNOWN IMPACTS. SINCE THE PROJECTS ARE UNDEFINED IT'S DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THEIR MERITS MUCH LESS WHETHER THOSE MERITS JUSTIFY. PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT THIS IS OPENING A MASSIVE HOLE IN THE WHOLE PROCESS PERHAPS I WAS SPEAKING TO STRONGLY TO SAY THIS WILL OF THIS RATE SEQUEL. BUT I WILL BET YOU THAT THIS KIND OF CONTINUED EFFORT WILL INDEED EVISCERATE SYKORA AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MIAMI BEACH TOMORROW IF WE KEEP DOING THIS WE WILL LOOK LIKE MIAMI BEACH IN THE FUTURE -- INTO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO. YOU SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WITH RAMPANT GROWTH. WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WITHOUT OUR ABILITY TO DO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES POINTED OUT. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO TO HELP THE UNDERSERVED WILL HURT THEM? NOT HELP THEM AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REGIONAL VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR DEALERS OR TO LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I THINK IT'S ALL OF US ARE AWARE WE HAVE A HOUSING PROBLEM IN THE STATE. AND THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS WE'RE WORKING TO TRY TO DEAL WITH IT. THIS BILL IS ONLY FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOT ALL HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SOMETHING WHICH I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE. THERE WAS A REPORT ISSUED -- I GUESS MAYBE LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO BY OUR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE. THAT ANALYZE THE CHALLENGES -- THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD ON THE ISSUE OF SEQUEL TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IS IT A BIG PROBLEM OR IS IT A LITTLE PROBLEM. AND THE CONCLUSION THAT THAT COMMITTEE REACH WAS THAT IT'S A VERY SMALL PROBLEM. THAT ONLY A FRACTION OF THE CHALLENGES ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. ARE ON THE ISSUE OF SEQUEL. SO THE SUGGESTION THIS IS GOING TO CLOG THE COURTS I THINK HIS -- MASSIVELY OVERBLOWN. IN FACT THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT THERE WOULD BE FEW CHALLENGES -- UNDER THE EFFORT THAT WE'RE ALL PUTTING IN TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT IF THERE IS WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING NOT THAT THE COURT EGGMAN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND RULES. BUT THEY EXPEDITE THE REVIEW IT DOESN'T PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE OF JUSTICE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER IT'S SIMPLY SAYS RESOLVE THE ISSUE. IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE STATE IS NOT GOING TO REQUIRE. SIMPLY THE ACT OF OUR BUDGET THAT WE CAN FIND AND AND BY OUR WAY OUT OF THAT PROBLEM. IT'S GONNA REQUIRE THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST IN THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS TO TAKE THE RISK AND THE CHANCE. OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE INVESTED IN BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT WILL ONLY COME FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING. SOME ELEMENT OF CERTAINTY THAT WHATEVER THAT IS IS ON THE PROJECT THEY CAN GET RESOLVED IN A TIMELY WAY. WHEN A PROJECT GOES TO THE SEQUEL PROCESS? IT'S NOT JUST ALL ABOUT. SIX IT'S A GOVERNING JURISDICTION REVEALING IT AND MAKING CHOICES CITY COUNCIL'S BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES AOUND A PROJECT INCLUDING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT AND MAKING A JUDGMENT. I CHALLENGE ON SEQUEL IN MOST CASES UNDER THIS BILL WILL BE AFTER THAT JURISDICTION'S DECIDED THAT THAT AFFORDABLE PROJECT IS. THOUGHTFULLY DONE REASONABLE NECESSARY IT COMPLIES WITH THE QUOTE. THIS BILL ONLY DEALS WITH THE CHALLENGES. AND IN SOME CASES IT'S ARGUED THEIR RARE. BUT ITS FOCUS IS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.

MOVING NOW TO FOLLOW ITEM EIGHTY THREE SENATORS KEEP SKINNER ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THIS MAJOR. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE ONE SECOND. EIGHTY THREE YES. SENATE BILL FORTY TWO BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO JAILS. THANK YOU I MISSED RESIDENT AND MEMBERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN JESSICA ST LOUIS WAS RELEASED FROM SANTA RITA JAIL. AT ONE TWENTY FIVE IN THE MORNING. SHE WAS GIVEN A PARK TICKET IN FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE BAY AREA PART IS OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM. THE NEAREST BART STATION FROM SANTA RITA JAIL WAS ABOUT A HALF A MILE. THE AREA BETWEEN STANNARY TO JAIL AND PARTS IS PRETTY REMOTE VERY DESERTED -- BUT THIS IS WHAT SHE WAS AT ONE TWENTY FIVE AM IN THE MORNING. RELEASED FROM JAIL GIVEN OF OUR TICKET. PART DID NOT OPEN DID NOT BEGIN ITS OPERATIONS FOR HOURS LATER. THAT MORNING JESSICA ST LOUIS WAS FOUND. ABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY FROM BART. DEAD FROM AN OVERDOSE. THIS WAS AN AVOIDABLE DEATH. LATE NIGHT RELEASES ARE DANGEROUS THEY'RE DANGEROUS FOR ANYONE BUT ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN WHAT ARE WE DOING. PREDATORY PEOPLE. HANG OUT NEAR OUR JAILS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RELEASED SO WHEN FOLKS ARE RELEASED WITHOUT A WORKING CELL PHONE. WITHOUT A RIDER TRANSPORTATION. IN DURING UNSAFE HOURS. DANGEROUS AVOIDABLE INCIDENTS CAN HAPPEN. WHAT THIS BILL DOES? IS ALLOWS. JAILS TO OFFER TO THE PERSON. A SAFE PLACE TO STAY UNTIL IT'S DAYTIME HOURS TO A TO SEE FOR RELEASE TIME. GIVES THEM ACCESS TO FREE PHONE CALL SO THEY MIGHT ARRANGE TRANSPORTATION. GIVES THEM ACCESS TO A CELL PHONE CHARGER SO THEY COULD CHARGE THEIR CELL PHONE. SHE TOOK REALLY GOOD HANDS. HERE SO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT. TO MINIMIZE THE DANGER OF A LATE NIGHT RELEASES THE HIGHLY COSTLY PARTS OF THE BILL THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED TO IT A COUNTY TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION. OR REQUIRED OTHER THINGS ON THE COUNTY WERE REMOVED THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN. SO THIS BILL IS NOW MUCH MORE NARROWED BUT IT'S REAL PURPOSE IS TO TRY TO MINIMIZE -- THOSE UNSAFE RELEASES AND IT'S SIMILAR TO SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS IN LA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SOONER JONES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. FORTY TWO I VOTED NO ON THIS MAJOR OPPOSED IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. BUT COLLEAGUES I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. THAT I PUT DOWN INTO WORDS. AFTER REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN COMING OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS I BELIEVE THE BILL NOW ESTABLISHES VERY REASONABLE SAFETY MEASURES. FOR THOSE BEING RELATE RELEASED FROM COUNTY JAILS. I THINK THE AUTHOR AND PLOT THE AUTHORED AND APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR FOR THEIR MAJOR CHANGES IN -- DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY FOR ADVANCING THIS BILL THIS TRAGIC DEATH OCCURRED. THIS WOMAN DIED.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. SOONER SKINNER YOU TO QUESTION. CENTERS CAN WE TAKE QUESTION YES I WILL THANKS CENTER MORE LOCK JUST [inaudible] ONE QUESTION ABOUT. THE POLICE THAT THE SHERIFF WOULD HAVE. TO TO DRIVE A POTENTIAL. RELEASE PERSON UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE JAIL IS THAT STILL IN THE BILL NO THAT A MAN THE AMENDMENTS INTO PROBES REMOVED THAT FROM THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IT ON THE SIDE OF NINETEEN NINE SENATOR -- YES. SENATE ARE JULY. MATTER PRESS. MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE BECAUSE I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OBVIOUSLY THE TIME THAT I SPENT WITH THE AUTHOR VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. THE THE ISSUES THAT ARE HERE SAFETY. SAFETY AND AND A SENSE OF HUMANITY AS SENSE OF CARING. OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED THEY'VE DONE THEIR TIME WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND SOMETIMES IT'S YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. WHO DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO GO AND ARE LEFT OUT IN THE STREET AND I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE? THAT ALL OF US TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF WHETHER THEY GO TO A HOMELESS SHELTER WERE PICKED UP BY FAMILY BUT CERTAINLY NOT THROWN UP THE STREET AND I THINK THIS ADDRESSES THAT. AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO FOR ALL OF US TO COME TOGETHER AND REALIZE THAT THE LESS FORTUNATE CAN NOW BE TAKEN CARE OF AND I THINK THIS BILL NOT ONLY TO PUBLIC SAFETY BILL. BUT AS A BILL TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO REALLY NEED HELP. AND I THANK YOU AND I URGE OF AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL. DEBATE ON THIS ITEM -- SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE GOOD SENATOR FROM OAKLAND I'D LIKE TO CERTAINLY COMMAND YOU I THINK THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE AND VERY OB. COMPASSIONATE LOOK ON A OUT THE SITUATION THAT DEVELOPED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL AND HOPEFULLY NOT FOR OTHERS HOWEVER THERE REMAINS A CONCERN. ON ONE PARTICULAR ELEMENT AND THAT IS THE RELEASE OF IT UN MADE WITH THREE DAYS OF MEDICATION. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED -- COMES THE HAVE ANY CONCERN OR CONSIDERED PERHAPS AN AMENDMENT. THAT WOULD BE RESTRICTIVE ON THE KIND OF MEDICATIONS BECAUSE OUR ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF HAVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED A WILL A NUMBER OF THESE THINGS THAT REMAIN CONCERNED. REGARDING THE MEDICATION ISSUE AND I THINK ABOUT SOMETHING IF SERRATION WITH ABUSE PROBLEMS HE MIGHT BE. GOOD TO ALLOW AWESOME RESTRICTION ON THAT PART. QUESTION ARE. YEAH I I WOULD TAKE YOUR QUESTION. HOW'S IT PROGRESSES WOULD YOU CONSIDER WRITING NARROWING DOWN A TAD AT CURRENTLY. END OF COLLEGES MY I'M NOT READING THE WHOLE BILL IN FRONT OF BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT WE WORDED THAT SECTION AS THAT IS ESSENTIAL MEDICATIONS. BUT I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO LOOK AT WHETHER THAT WORDING IS TO BROADEN MIGHT BE VIEWED AS BUT IT WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE PERSON RELEASED HAD THREE DAYS OF ESSENTIAL MEDICATIONS AND CLEARLY AS WE KNOW IF FOR EXAMPLE THE PERSON IS DIABETIC. THAT DO WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN PRESCRIPTIONS ARE VERY ESSENTIAL FOR THIS LIFESAVING PURPOSES -- BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK AND SEE WHETHER THAT LANGUAGE IS TO ADD A IS NOT. DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH CLARITY. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME MISTER PRESIDENT I AM NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT THEIR SAID YES WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THAT PARTICULAR AYE ELEMENT IN THE BILL -- CONSIDER A PERMISSIVE PART IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION -- THE OB.

SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY TWO BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO CORRECTIONS CENTER WINNER I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES -- SP -- ONE THIRTY TWO ADDRESSES A VERY REAL PROBLEM FACING INCARCERATED TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS -- NAMELY THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE BEING HELD ACCORDING TO THEIR BIRTH SSIGNED SOCKS RATHER BAD AND NOT ACCORDING TO THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR OWN PERCEPTION. OF THEIR SAFETY WHICH RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT -- VIOLENCE -- SPECIFICALLY TRANSGENDER WOMEN ARE FREQUENTLY CLASSIFIED AND THEN HOUSED IN PRISON AS MEN WHERE THEY ARE PROMPTLY VICTIMIZED ASSAULTED RAPED. AND THEN THEY ARE PLACED IN ISOLATION FOR THEIR QUOTE ON QUOTE FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION WHICH SURPRISED SOME OF ACCESS TO SERVICES. SB ONE THIRTY TWO WILL ENSURE THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND EXTRA ARE TREATED ACCORDING TO THEIR ACTUAL GENDER IDENTITY NOT DOT. WHICH WAS ASSIGNED TO THEM I BIRTH. SB ONE THIRTY TWO WILL REQUIRE THAT DURING THE INITIAL INTAKE PROCESS I SEE TO SEE OUR WILL RECORD THE INDIVIDUAL'S GENDER IDENTITY -- AND OTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THAT INDIVIDUALS -- GENDER. HI THE BILL WILL REQUIRE ALL SEVEN CONTRACTORS -- AT CDC ARE TO CONSISTENTLY -- THREE AND ADDRESS THE PERSON ACCORDING TO THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. FIVE THE BILL REQUIRES YOU TO SEE OUR TO HAL'S BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACCORDING TO THEIR GENDER IDENTITY UNLESS THERE IS A SPECIFIC @SAFETY DO SO THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE INDIVIDUAL. AND SO FORTH -- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FACING OUR POPULATION OF TRANSGENDER INCARCERATED -- CALIFORNIANS -- AND IT'S TIME TO START TREATING THEM WITH THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR -- IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION A BIT ON THE SIDE ON SCENE HERE. NINE MOUNT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SIR BORDERS IS RESUMES POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. FROM CENTER BORDERS YES. CENTER BORDERS SO CAN YOU CLARIFY -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF IT INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIES. THAT THEY ARE IN A SAFETY RISK SITUATION AND THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL -- BE RE HOUSED. IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT I'M SORRY I COULDN'T HEAR YOU SPEAK CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE I GOT A NOTHING I MEAN I GOT. ONE AS BIG AS YOURS NOW ANY OF OUR IDEA -- IF THE IN IF THE INMATE BELIEVES THAT HE OR SHE IS AT RESTORING DANGER. THAT INDIVIDUAL THEN TRIGGERS A RIGHT FOR THEM TO BE RELOCATED ELSEWHERE. IS THAT THE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHETHER IT'S AN INTAKE OR LATER -- I EXPRESSES THAT THEIR GENDER IDENTITY IS INCONSISTENT WITH HOW THEY'RE BEING HOUSE. I'VE BEEN THERE WILL BE HAVE TO BE HOUSED ACCORDING TO THEIR GENDER IDENTITY UNLESS CDC ARE HAS A SPECIFIC SAFETY OR SECURITY REASON. NOT TO HONOR. THAT REQUEST SO THE BILL DOES HAVE FLEXIBILITY FOR CDC ARE IF THERE'S A SPECIFIC SAFETY RESEARCH OUR CONCERN RELATING THAT INDIVIDUAL BUT OTHERWISE YES. ALRIGHT SO -- THE THIRD DANGER BY THE MOVING OF INDIVIDUALS BASED ON RISK OR DANGER IS BASED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GENDER IDENTITY IS THAT CORRECT. I'M SORRY I CAN YOU REPEAT THAT. THE REMOVAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL BASED ON RISK OR DANGER IS ONLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GENDER IDENTITY IS THAT CORRECT. THE THE THE THE GOAL OF THE BILL'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THAT IF SOMEONE. IF THAT PERSON GENDER IDENTITY IS [inaudible] EMAIL. AND THE PERSON WILL BE HOUSE AS A FEMALE. THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE BILL AND SAFETY AND SECURITY IS PART OF THAT. BUT IT'S NOT. THE ENTIRETY IT'S REALLY ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AS WHO THEY ARE. INSTEAD OF SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE CERTAINLY AND AND MAYBE I'LL JUST POSE MY DIRECT QUESTION TO YOU. DOES THIS CREATE A SCENARIO IN YOUR OPINION -- THE INDIVIDUALS ARTIFICIALLY EXPRESSING A RISK FOR A DANGER TO SHOP. FIVE PLACES WHERE THEY WILL BE HELD SO THEY CAN MOVE FROM POINT A TO POINT B.. BECAUSE OF A PERCEIVED RISK I I I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS A REAL RISK HERE THAT WAS OKAY -- DIE THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT WE SOMETIMES HEAR WITH THE SO CALLED ODD BATHROOM BILLS YOU MAY RECALL IN NORTH CAROLINA. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL -- SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE GENDER ASSIGNED TO A BIRTH AND THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO USE THE THE A RESTROOM IN ORDER TO ASSAULT PEOPLE -- THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT -- AND AND THAT LAW WAS ULTIMATELY A CAMERA CREW WAS REPEALED OR SCALE BACK -- YOU KNOW THE I. SO I DON'T SEE THAT -- AS A RISK AND AGAIN CITY SIR DOES HAVE FLEXIBILITY -- TO MAKE A SECURITY ASSESSMENT SPECIFIC THAT INDIVIDUAL -- SO THERE IS NOT FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE LAW [inaudible] DINNER BILL. OF THIS PRESENT MEMBERS -- I RECENTLY -- HAVE VISITED MANY OF OUR STATE -- PENAL INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA LATELY I WENT DOWN TO THE DONOVAN'S -- PRISON AND SAN DIEGO. AND EVERY TIME I GO TO ONE OF THESE FACILITIES. THE ISSUE RAISED BY. THE CENTER FROM SAN FRANCISCO COMES UP. IN TERMS OF SAFETY IN FACT -- THE PRISON OF PROCESS AND AND AND POLICIES OF OF MIXED YARDS HAS BECAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE FIGHTS RIOTS OTHER KINDS OF PROBLEMS. AND WE NEED TO ESTABLISH -- SPECIFIC -- SECURITY. AT PROTECTION [inaudible] FOR BECAUSE OF THIS POPULATION AND OTHERS IN OUR CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS. SO HERE'S AN AYE VOTE ON THIS THIS IS A THIS IS A PROTECTION ON THIS WILL PROTECT PEOPLE FROM BEING HARMED. INJURED. AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD POLICY FOR THE STATE TO ADD AS WELL AS WELL CONCEIVED. ARJUN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. UNION SEEN NONE CENTER WE WERE TO LIKE CLOSE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE COSTS OUR NATION OVER FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BUT EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT HELPED REDUCE THESE COSTS. TREATMENT IS ALSO LESS EXPENSIVE THAN COMMON ALTERNATIVE OUTCOMES SUCH AS INCARCERATING ADDICTED PERSONS CURRENTLY RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A LICENSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DH CS. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AS BE EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHICH FURTHER REQUIRED RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS TO UTILIZE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT STANDARDS. OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS HOWEVER DO NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRE ANY LICENSING NOR DO THEY NEED TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT. DH CS OFFERS A CERTIFICATION PROGRAM BUT IT IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY TODAY IF YOU WANT TO OPEN YOUR OWN OUTPATIENT OUTPATIENT TREATMENT FACILITY YOU COULD DO SO IMMEDIATELY. NO LICENSE NO TRAINING OR PRIOR EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED. SB THREE TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMS TO BE LICENSED WITH DH CS IT ALSO REQUIRES A LICENSED PROVIDERS TO KEEP RECORDS OF ADMISSIONS WITHDRAWALS TRANSFERS AND DISCHARGES. AND THE REASON FOR EACH. ADDITIONALLY THIS MEASURE WOULD PROHIBIT LICENSED PROVIDERS FROM ENGAGING IN PATIENTS CELL IN AND RECRUITING FOR MONETARY GAIN. THOUGH SHE CAN TREAT SEEKING TREATMENT.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT SB THREE THREE ONE FULL REQUIRE ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES TO DEVELOP A SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ADOLESCENCE. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED A CONSTANT RISE AND DEATH BY SUICIDE. ALARMINGLY YOUTH SUICIDE AND SELF INFLICTED INJURY ARE ON THE RISE AND IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG YOUTH AGES FIFTEEN THROUGH TWENTY FOUR IN THE U. S.. AND FOR OUR YOUNG WOMAN SUICIDE RATES AMONG TEENAGE GIRLS HAVE HIT A FORTY YEAR HI. IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST ONE HALF OF LGBT Q. STUDENTS REPORTED SUICIDE -- IDEATION AND MORE THAN THREE TIMES AS TO MY BROTHER ST PEERS. AND FRESNO COUNTY ALONE FOR EACH TEAM WHO DIES BY SUICIDE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY YOUTH WERE TREATED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BALLING SELF INJURY AND MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND ADOLESCENTS BUT SERIOUSLY ABOUT AND IN THEIR LIVES. STUDIES SHOW THAT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS CAN HELP AVOID A SUICIDAL CRISIS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN CONVENING STAKEHOLDERS FROM DIVERSE SECTORS LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HEALTHCARE YOUTH JUSTICE PUBLIC SERVICE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING TO HELP FORM STRATEGIC PREVENTION ORIENTED PLANS. WHEN COUNTIES IMPLEMENT STRATEGIC SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANTS THEY RESULT IN FEWER SO YOUR SUICIDE DEATHS IN THEIR COUNTY? HOWEVER SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE ONLY SEVEN OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE ADOPTED SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLANS. MORE PROACTIVE ACTION IS NEEDED TO HELP ADDRESS SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND PREVENT TEEN SO ONCE TEEN SUICIDE INCLUDING A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH. SB THREE THREE ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ARE TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO HELP PREVENT TEEN SUICIDE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM.

NEXT UP IS FILE ITEM NINETY EIGHT BY SENATOR DODD MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR DODD AN ACT RELATING TO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. MR. SENATOR WHEN YOU'RE READY MISS PRESENT MEMBERS SB THREE FOR FIFTY TWO WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF AB CD ISSUE UP TO NEWT. TEN NEW TYPE FORTY SEVEN LICENSES IN THOSE COUNTIES OF REACH THECURRENT LIMIT ON ALCOHOL LICENSES. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW CURRENT LAW PLACES A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF ON SALE GENERAL LICENSES. TO ONE LICENSE FOR EVERY TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN THAT COUNTY WELL THE SYSTEM WORKS FOR MOST. THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTIES WHERE THE DEMAND FOR ALCOHOL LICENSE FAR OUTWEIGHS CURRENT NUMBER OF LICENSES. IN NAPA COUNTY FOR INSTANCE THE POPULATION IS LOW THAT'S THE NUMBER OF LICENSES IS AS WELL HOWEVER BECAUSE OF TOURISM THE DEMAND FOR RESTAURANTS TO SERVE. ALCOHOL IS MUCH HIGHER INDIVIDUALS HOPING TO GET ARE. OPEN A RESTAURANT IN THESE COUNTY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FORCED TO GO TO THE OPEN MARKET WERE LICENSES CAN COST UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN OBSTACLE THAT MANY CANNOT OVERCOME. THIS RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF REVENUE TO OUR CITIES IN OUR STATE NOT TO MENTION LOTS OF JOBS FOR COMMUNITIES. AT A TIME MORE DEMAND FOR RESTAURANTS AS AN ALL TIME HIGH IT IS TIME FOR US TO RE EVALUATE HOW THE STATE ISSUES THESE LICENSES. I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION THE BILL IS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR A THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

NEXT UP IS FILE ITEM NINETY NINE BY SENATOR HILL. MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY BY SENATOR HILL AN ACT RELATING TO MANDATED REPORTERS SENATOR HILL. THANK THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT UP MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY MANDATED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT REPORTERS. BUT A LOOPHOLE IN EXISTING LAW ALLOWS CLERGY TO LAWFULLY IGNORE SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE ENDED IN THE COLLECT IF THEY ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE DURING A CONVERSATION THAT I INTENDED. TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. SB THREE SIXTY WOULD BEGIN TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE BY REQUIRING CLERGY TO REPORT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. IF THEY ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE OR SUSPICION DURING A PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION WITH AN EMPLOYEE AT THEIR FACILITY FOR WITH ANOTHER CLERGY MEMBER. SB THREE SIXTY ALSO NARROWS THE DEFINITION OF PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION. TO QUALIFIED THE COMMUNICATION MUST BE VERBAL. MADE PRIVATELY TO A CLERGY MEMBER INTENDED TO BE AN ACT OF CONTRITION OR MATTER OF CONSCIENCE AND IN A CONTEXT OF STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY THAT IS CONSIDERED INVIOLATE BY CHURCH DOCTRINE. AS MANDATED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT REPORTERS DOCTORS PSYCHIATRISTS THERAPISTS AND OTHERS SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT WITHOUT EXCEPTION. CLERGY HAVE BEEN EXEMPT FROM FULL REPORTING IF THEY BELIEVE THE CONVERSATION WAS INTENDED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. CHILD ABUSE WITHIN RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN MAKING OF GLOBAL HEADLINES WITH POPE FRANCIS RECENTLY PROPOSING MANDATORY INTERNAL REPORTING WITHIN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. IT'S ALSO A LOCAL ISSUE IN MARCH A PRIEST WAS ARRESTED IN THE BAY AREA ON SUSPICION OF THIRTY COUNTS OF CHILD SEX ABUSE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT SPANS DENOMINATIONS WITH CASES COMING OUT OF THE MORMON CHURCH JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES. AND UNITED METHODIST CHURCH. CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE TRAILBLAZING WITH THIS MEASURE. CONNECTICUT INDIANA MISSISSIPPI NEBRASKA NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW JERSEY NORTH CAROLINA OKLAHOMA RHODE ISLAND TENNESSEE. TEXAS AND WEST VIRGINIA ALREADY HAVE SIMILAR STATUTE THEY OPERATE UNDER THE SAME CONSTITUTION AND BILL OF RIGHTS AS WEAK. AND HAVE FOUND NO LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THOSE STATUTES WHEN A CHILD IS BEING ABUSED OR NEGLECTED THEY OFTEN DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM. WE RELY ON ADULTS WHO HEAR SOMETHING OR SEE SOMETHING TO SAY SOMETHING WHICH IS WHY DOCTORS AND THERAPISTS MUST REPORT. CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT NO MATTER WHAT FAITH LEADERS HAVE BEEN THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE AMONG MANDATED REPORTERS INSTEAD OF PROTECTING CHILDREN. SOME HAVE BEEN SHIELDING ABUSERS IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO PUT CHILDREN FIRST I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL CALLING. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. THERE'S NO SIMPLE SOLUTION IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS REASONS FOR THE LARGE NUMBER OF HOMELESS VETERANS ARE NUMEROUS AND COMPLEX. TWO OF THE BIGGEST FACTORS ARE THE EXTREME SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A LIVABLE INCOME. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS AT VETERANS FACED BY DOING THE FOLLOWING. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR CAPS THE PROPERTY TAXES ON THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF AN HONORABLY DISCHARGED VETERAN.

TO UPDATED STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S. GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM HAZARDOUS AND GROW THE CHEMICALS. IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. HI TEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA ESTABLISH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE INCLUDING. THE FIRST OF ITS KIND SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM INTO THE DEPARTMENT TALK TO SUB IS CONTROL. SINCE THEN THE PROGRAM IS DEVELOPED A ROBUST AND PROMISING FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HAZARDS US MANUFACTURERS. TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES IN REGULATE BEST PRACTICES. HOWEVER IN TEN YEARS. ZERO PRODUCTS MEMBERS NOT A SINGLE PRODUCT HAS SUCCESSFULLY GONE. THROUGH THIS REGULATORY PROCESS AND SO -- AT LAST YEAR. THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE -- TOOK A TEN YEAR OF SURVEY OF THE CURRENT GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. INTERVIEWED DOZENS OF STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS INDUSTRY ACADEMIA GOVERNMENT TO FIND THE CAUSES OF THIS SLOWDOWN IN THIS IN ACTION. IN A RELEASE THEIR FINDINGS AND REPORT.

ICE TWENTY THREE KNOWS NINE THE MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS REMOVING BACK ON THE FILE WE'RE GONNA RETURN TO FILE ITEM NINETY SIX SENATOR MITCHELL MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY NINE BY SENATOR MITCHELL AN ACT RELATING TO DISCRIMINATION. FOR YOUR CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THE HOUSING CRISIS AS WE ALL KNOW. HAS HIT LOW INCOME RENTERS THE HARDEST. RISE HE RIPS LACK OF AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INSPECTED INCOMES MAKE THIS POPULATION THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS. A HOMELESSNESS INCREASE ACROSS THE STATE AND IN RECOGNITION OF RISING RATE BURDEN BEING THE PRIMARY DRIVER THIS HOMELESSNESS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THIS IS A HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION MEASURE THAT WILL HELP TO STEM THE TIDE OF HOMELESSNESS AND INSURE THOSE EFFORTS ARE EFFECTIVE. SB THREE TWENTY NINE WILL ENABLE FAMILIES WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO SUCCESSFULLY APPLY FOR AND OBTAIN HOUSING THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT BE LITERALLY TURNED AWAY AT EVERY DOOR AND FORCED TO RETURN THEIR ASSISTANCE ON USE. AS WE THINK SOLUTIONS TO HOUSING SUPPLY ISSUES WE MUST ENSURE STRICTLY RENTERS. CAN ACCESS EXISTING HOUSING TO EXISTING SUBSIDY PROGRAMS WHILE SUPPLY SIDE MEASURES PLAY OUT. I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF YOU ABOUT THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM IN SEOUL A NUMBER OF VERY. REASONABLE QUESTIONS HAVE COME UP. FOR EXAMPLE HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR ABOUT YOUR SISTER FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL TO FIND HOUSING. FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS OFTEN WAIT YEARS TO RECEIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND EVEN WHEN THEY CAN AFFORD THE RENT BEING ASKED FOR WITH THEIR RENTAL ASSISTANCE THEY OFTEN HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING THE LANDLORD THAT WILL ACCEPT THE PAYMENT. ONCE AN ELIGIBLE FOUND IN THE WEIGHTLESS IS ISSUED A VOUCHER THEY TYPICALLY ARE ONLY GIVEN SIXTY DAYS TO SUCCESSFULLY FIND AT LEAST HOUSING WITH THEIR ASSISTANCE. IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE FINE LINE THE ASSISTANCE IS REVOKED WHICH MEANS THEY LOSE THEIR VOUCHER. THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT LOOKED AT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HOUSING FOR FAMILIES WITH SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT FOR EVERY THIRTY NINE RENTAL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR APARTMENTS THAT A FAMILY WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE COULD AFFORD. THERE WAS ONLY ONE THAT DID NOT EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT VOUCHER HOLDER FROM APPLYING. YOU'VE SEEN THE NOTICES TWO BEDROOM ONE BATH NO SECTION EIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] INDEED. WHERE WHERE WERE SB THREE TWENTY NINTHS PROTECTIONS -- IN PLACE WE WOULD HAVE MORE PEOPLE USING THEIR VOUCHERS. IN SITUATIONS WITH THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE NOT IN PLACE WE SEE THE NILE RATES AS HIGH AS COLLEAGUES I BELIEVE THE SITUATION IS AN ACCEPTABLE IF WE FIND OURSELVES FACING DATA THAT FOOD STAMPS AND PEOPLE CAN USE THAT ASSISTANCE. TO EAT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED AS A FAILURE OF PUBLIC POLICY. SB THREE TWENTY NINE REPRESENTS A PROVEN SOLUTION. THE A THE HUD STUDY FOUND THAT IN JURISDICTIONS WITH SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS THIS DENIAL RATE WAS ALMOST CUT IN HALF. FOLKS OF EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD BE FORCED TO ACCEPT ALL APPLICANTS WHO USE A HOUSING VOUCHERS. CLARIFICATION THIS BILL WILL NOT REQUIRE THAT ALL LANDLORDS EXCEPT EVERY VOUCHER HOLDING APPLICANT NOR INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS IN THE MARKET. THE BILL REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO ALLOW ASSISTANT RESIDENTS TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS WHILE ALSO ALLOWING LANDLORDS TO APPLY THEIR RENTAL CRITERIA TO ACCEPTED DID NOT A FAMILY WITH ASSISTANCE IN THE SAME WAY THEY WOULD ACCEPT OR DENY. ANY OTHER POTENTIAL TENANTS. THE BILL ALSO DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT LANDLORDS MAY CHARGE FOR RENT. IF AN ASSISTED FAMILIES ABLE TO AFFORD THE RENT BEING CHARGED THE BILL ALLOWS THEM TO APPLY. BUT DOES NOT FORCE LANDLORDS TO RENT IT ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL OR TO COMPLY WITH SECTION EIGHT PAYMENT STANDARDS. LASTLY A NUMBER OF YOU THEY ASK QUESTIONS WITH REGARD. TO THE A SECTION -- EIGHT PROCESS BY WHICH YOU COULD GET YOUR UNIT VERIFIED I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE ALL CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES. SO WHAT STEPS ARE REQUIRED OF LANDLORDS TO RECEIVE SECTION EIGHT ANOTHER HOUSING ASSISTANCE. THE LANDLORD COMPLETES AN AGREEMENT WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY WHICH STATE THAT THEY WILL MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY AND COMPLY WITH THE PROGRAM REGULATIONS AND HOUSING. IF THE UNIT IS APPROVED IN THE RENT BEING CHARGED WITH THE PAYMENT STAND FOR THE PROGRAM THE TENET IS ALLOWED TO USE THEIR ASSISTANCE FOR THE UNIT AND SIGNED THE LEASE WITH THE LANDLORD. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT HOUSING AUTHORITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE ARE TYING TO USE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING PEOPLE. TO KIND OF PRE APPLY HAVE UNITS PRE APPROVED EXCEPT ARE TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. I'VE SHARED WITH SOME OF YOU DOCUMENTATION VERTICALLY WITH REGARD TO HALFWAY LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT CLEAR FIVE THAT IT DOES NOT TAKE AS MUCH MS AS LONG AS TWO MONTHS. TO GET A UNIT APPROVED IT CAN HAPPEN WITHIN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME UP TO A WEEK AND A HALF TO TWO WEEKS. SO WE WORKED VERY HARD TO PROVIDE AS MUCH CLARIFICATION AS POSSIBLE TO ALL OF YOU SO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BASIC TENETS OF THIS BILL. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE SOURCE OF INCOME DOESN'T BECOME. A SOURCE OF DISCRIMINATION. THAT JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A HOUSING VOUCHER I SHOULD BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY FROM ANYONE ELSE WHO APPLIES FOR YOUR UNIT AND CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE RENT. AS WE TALK ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE WANT ADDRESS OUR HOUSING STOCK PRICES ARE HOMELESS THIS CRISIS WE MUST CAPITALIZE ON THE CURRENT. FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM SECTION ACTUALLY STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND ACCEPTED. WITH THAT COLLEAGUES I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB. THREE TWO NINE THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. TWO BEDROOMS TWO BATHROOMS. NO SECTION. EIGHT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS YOU WORK YOUR HEART OUT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE. AND IT SAYS DESPITE FINALLY GETTING AN OPPORTUNITY. THERE IS NO REAL OPPORTUNITY. THE DIGEST IN OUR ANALYSIS SAYS. THIS BILL PROHIBITS LANDLORDS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST TENANTS WHO RELY UPON THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAID DIRECTLY LANDLORDS SUCH A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. TO HELP THEM PAY THE RENT. PRETTY SIMPLE PRETTY BASIC WE HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS IN OUR COUNTRY CERTAIN BSIC IDEAS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE RIGHT TO CLEAN WATER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE BELIEVE IN IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY CRITICAL AND I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. WHAT I DO SO WITH THAT ADMONITION TO THIS BODY? NOT TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT TO REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT SECTION EIGHT IS. IT'S OVER TWELVE HUNDRED PAGES OF REGULATION. THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS WHICH I HAVE HERE ORDER SECTION EIGHT HOUSING ARE PRETTY EGREGIOUS. AGREE JUST ON BOTH SIDES WITH THE YOUR TENANT OR LANDLORD. I CAN GO THROUGH AND READ THEM I LOOKED AT THEM AND THEY KIND OF TURN MY STOMACH AND I DON'T WANT TO GO ON TOO LONG. BUT OWN TELLING YOU IS THAT WE'VE GONE WHICH A CHALLENGE HERE ONE THE ONE HAND WE'RE WORKING ON THIS HOUSING PROBLEM WE USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. TO GO OUT AND TO TRY TO FIND STUFF TO GIVE PEOPLE HOPE AND THEN BE LANDLORDS BECAUSE PARK WITH. SUCH A TIME FOR ALL DIFFERENT SORTS OF REASONS BUT THE REALITY IS AND WHAT I WANT TO RAISE YOUR AND I REYES WHEN CENTER LENO HAD THIS MEASURE I RAISE IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT SUPPORT IN THE DISCUSSION. IS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE VIGILANT. THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT IT IS NECESSARY IT MEANS THAT ALL OF US IN OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE DETAIL. THE GREAT ARCHITECT IN FROM FROM CHICAGO MEETS VANDROSS SAYS GODS IN TE DETAILS I DON'T BELIEVE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS I BELIEVE GOD IS IN THE DETAILS WOULD YOU FOCUS ON THE DETAILS. AND WHEN YOU DON'T JUST LOOK AT THE TOP LINE BUT START DIGGING IN ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE IMPACTED ON ALL SIDES WE CAN'T STOP THE FIGHT THIS IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS FIGHT. BUT IT IS ONLY A A GIGANTIC CRITICAL STEP BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY STEP I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK CENTER CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU -- INITIALLY I I HEARD THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE -- PRETTY MUCH EVERY EVERY RENTER DATED TO TO GO INTO -- THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM SO WE STARTED REALLY DIGGING INTO THIS BILL AND READING THE LANGUAGE AND I COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY OUT THERE. ANYWHERE TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE LANGUAGE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT DID THAT. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TALKING ABOUT. THE DEVIL BEING IN THE DETAILS. FORGOT BEING IN THE DETAILS OR US THE LEGISLATURE REALLY VERY VERY NOT THE DETAILS. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE HOUSE EVERYONE IN THE STATE AND AND THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM -- IS IS BEING CRITICIZED CURRENTLY BY THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL SENATE IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT BUREAUCRACY TO SORT THROUGH. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER ESPECIALLY WHEN. YOU MAY HAVE -- SOME SOME PEOPLE -- THAT ARE -- UNSOPHISTICATED IN THE IN IN THE PROCESSES OF RENTING MAYBE A LITTLE SIDE UNIT THEY HAVE OR A OR A HOME THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THIS NOT. NECESSARILY WANTING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM [inaudible] BUT THIS IS A DIFFICULT MATTER -- BECAUSE I I I WANNA ONE OF ALL. FOUR FOUR HOUSING MORE PEOPLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITHOUT. REQUIRING PEOPLE TO DO -- ONE ONE THING IN PARTICULAR IN THIS CASE SAYING YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT SECTION EIGHT YOU HAVE TO WAIT. FOR AN INSPECTION IN SOME INSTANCES I AM I'M GETTING SOME DATA THAT SHOWS THAT SOME PEOPLE OF WAITED THREE THREE MONTHS TO GET THAT INSPECTION. AND THAT COMES AT A COST IT'S NOT COMPENSATED TO THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND THAT MADE -- CREATE A ARE A BURDEN. ON ON THE SMALLER -- PROPERTY OWNERS WHO RAN. AND AND MAY -- OFTENTIMES HAVE A MORTGAGE ATTACHED TO PROPERTY. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WHILE I HOLD. THE ARE YOU KNOW IF IF THAT CONTINUES TO COME UP DURING THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OF THE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL BE SAID SYMPATHETIC. TO THAT LOOKING AT THAT TO SEE IF THE THE SMALLER PEOPLE THAT. WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS AND IMPOSE ON WHO WOULD BE IMPOSED. WHO WHO OF HOME A HARDSHIP WOULD BE IMPOSED ON? IN GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. BOB I I HOPE YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT WE DON'T -- MAKE IT SO PEOPLE TAKE PROPERTIES OFF THE MARKET BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE SPIRIT OF THE BILL. IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. I I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL LOOKING AND SAYING I THINK THIS BILL IS WELL WRITTEN. I THINK IT IT GETS TO WHAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE [inaudible] A OPPORTUNITY. A FAIR SYSTEM IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE ARE [inaudible] OUR OF ARE ARE GIVEN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW AND IF THE PEOPLE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FIND THAT HOUSING THERE ALSO FINDING A WAY TO RESOLVE. THE CHALLENGES WITHIN THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM. IF THERE ARE ANY BURDENS ARE POSED UPON THE PEOPLE THERE ARE THERE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS IN THIS RENTAL ECONOMY -- WE NEED TO FIX THOSE -- BUT GENERALLY. I I DO NOT SUPPORT DISCRIMINATION. AND THIS IS A DISCRIMINATION ISSUE AND I THINK. ON THAT BASIS -- EVERYONE EVERYONE HERE SHOULD COME UP ON THIS BILL THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS BILL -- THE THIS IS THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO VOTE FOR HERE NONE OF US HERE OR ANONE OUT THERE. IN OUR STAGES FOR DISCRIMINATION OF ANY BODY AND THERE ARE IF THERE ARE CHALLENGES I'M SURE ANYBODY OUT THERE CAN WORK THROUGH THEM AND I'M SURE. WE WILL WE WILL STAY -- VIGILANT ON THIS ISSUE AND HELP OUR OUR THE PEOPLE ARE COMMUNITY SORT TO KIND OF THOSE CHALLENGES IN THIS PROGRAM BUT BUT I JUST WANT. TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING OF UP THIS THIS MATTER. THANKYOU AND WE'RE SO CENTER OUR MEMBERS I SO I VOTED FOR THIS IN COMMITTEE HI IT WAS. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED -- BY THE SENATE FROM SAN DIEGO WERE RAISED TO ME IN MEETINGS AFTERWARDS AND I DID WANT TO RAISE AN ISSUE AND AND ASK. THE AUTHOR -- ABOUT THE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES AT PLAY HERE. IS THAT THERE ARE -- DID THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TASKS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INTERNET YOU YOU TOO QUESTION YEAH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TASK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY -- INSPECTION AND OTHER ISSUES RELATING TO THE GRANTING OF SEXUALLY FINES FOR PARTICULAR PROPERTY. AND WHAT I'VE HEARD THAT IN MY DISTRICT APPARENTLY CITY SANTA MONICA. IS VERY FAST AND VERY QUICK AND AND DOES THESE THINGS WELL IN FACT WAS A GROUP OF FOLKS WHO DON'T OFTEN. A COMPLEMENT THE CITY SANTA MONICA WHO WERE IN MY OFFICE -- FROM THE LANDLORD SIDE -- BUT ON THIS ISSUE THEY SAID THIS IS IN A MARKET HAS BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC JOB WITH REGARDS. TO QUICK TURNAROUND FOR SEXUALLY HOUSING BUT THAT IN THE CITY OFLOS ANGELES. THERE WERE ENORMOUS DELAYS ENORMOUS PROBLEMS. CAN YOU SPEAK TO SOME OF THE DISPARITIES IT SEEM TO EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IF WE PASS SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ENSURE THAT MORE LOCALITIES. ARE ARE ACTING IN A QUICK AND FARE -- EXPEDITED MANNER IN MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S COULD TURN AROUND. DO YOU MIND IF I JUST AT MY CLOSING. OUR SERVER I IN THE BE FINE YEAH BUT I PLAN TO OKAY LET ME JUST THAT MICHAEL YEAH OKAY SO I'M I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FOR DO YOU YOUR CLOSING. THAT THAT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I THINK MEMBERS WE PASS THIS BILL IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT THAT -- THAT THERE IS THERE ARE THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THIS RIGHT AND ACTUALLY MAKE A VERY ADVANTAGEOUS TO LANDLORDS A LOT OF LAND WAS ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SECTIONING ONCE THEY GET THE TENANTS IN BECAUSE IT'S A REGULAR PAYCHECK IT SHOWS UP ON TIME. NEVER BOUNCES YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT ANY PROBLEMS BUT THE ISSUE IS WITH THE INSPECTIONS AND THE THE FRONT END. IN SOME CITY SEEM TO DO WELL OTHER CITIES DOWN -- WE CAN MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK A LOT BETTER IF WE CAN REPLICATE WHAT'S HAPPENING THE CITIES ARE DOING A RIGHT. THANK YOU. SENATOR PROTON ATKINS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- I THINK A LOT OF THINGS I COULD HAVE SAID OF ALREADY BEEN SAID IN TERMS OF WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT CRITICALLY AT THIS TIME. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS -- YOU KNOW CITIES ARE GETTING BETTER AT THIS BECAUSE OVER THE LITTLE OVER THE YEARS -- THERE WAITING LISTS HAVE GROWN AND THEY'VE THEY FOCUSED MY CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS FOCUSED VERY HEAVILY ON WORKING WITH LANDLORDS. TO GET THESE ISSUES IRONED OUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE VOUCHERS AND BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CASE -- IN THE EVENT THAT OTHERS BECOME AVAILABLE -- WHETHER IT'S VAST VOUCHERS FOR VETERANS OR JUST THE GENERAL POOL -- SO I DO KNOWS THAT HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES ARE WORKING ON THAT VERY ISSUE. YOU KNOW I WANTED TO SAY IN MY CITY WHERE THERE'S MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES ON A WAITING LIST -- AND WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING HOUSING IN SAN DIEGO FOR DECADES -- PARTICULARLY WHEN I WAS ON THE COUNCILAND WE HAD REDEVELOPMENT WE COULD USE THAT 20% SET ASIDE TO BUILD -- THE AFFORDABLE UNITS WHICH ALSO -- THEY COULD ACCESS VOUCHERS. YOU KNOW ABOUT FOR A FAMILY WHO HAS WAITED EIGHT TO TEN TWELVE YEARS TO FINALLY BE APPROVED FOR A VOUCHER. AND THEN HAVE IT JERKED RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER THEIR FEET BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND A UNIT OF HOUSING IN A TIMELY FASHION. THAT'S JUST WRONG IT'S A I WOULD SAY ALMOST CRUEL -- AND FINALLY YOU KNOW. I RECALL WHEN I WAS A STAFF MEMBER CHRIS KEYHOE AT THE CITY COUNCIL I BEG TO DO HOUSING I WANTED TO DO HOUSING AND I LEARNED A LOT -- IN THE IN THE MID NINETIES WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR HER. 10% VACANCY RATES IN NORTH PARKING MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- SAN DIEGO -- AND AND SOUTHERN SAN DIEGO WILL REMEMBER THIS -- BECAUSE HE WORKED IN THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY A NUMBER OF YEARS -- AS THAT WE WERE COMING OUT OF THAT RECESSION. AT 10% VACANCIES 12% VACANCIES -- AND LAND OF PROPERTY OWNERS SMALL COMPLEXES THEY COUNTED. ON THE SAN DIEGO HUSING COMMISSION TO BE A PARTNER WITH THEM AT THAT TIME. THERE WERE THERE WAS NO DEBATE AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE OR YOU KNOW THESE ARE SMALL -- PROPERTY OWNERS WHO WERE STRUGGLING. AND SO THEY WERE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE -- THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY -- THIS REALLY IS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY NOT REQUIREMENTS BUT OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK WHEN YOU MEET THE FAMILIES AND THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON THESE WAITING LISTS THAT HAVE WAITED SO LONG. AND YOU YOU SEE WHO THEY ARE THESE ARE STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED A HOME WHO HAVE WAITED -- AND IF YOU ALSO THEN LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENTS AS AS MY COLLEAGUE OFFROM OUR SAN FERNANDO VALLEY POINTED OUT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENTS. MANY PEOPLE HAVE A PERCEPTION THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE VOUCHERS. SOMEHOW THEY'RE NOT GOOD TENANTS. AND I RECALL AS A STAFF MEMBER GETTING THOSE COMPLAINTS AND I WAS A I DID CONSTITUENTS SERVICES AND I RECALL. TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO SAID I KNOW THAT UNIT IN THAT BUILDING IS A PROBLEM I KNOW IT'S SECTION EIGHT IT'S PUBLIC HOUSING. AND THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE THERE DISRUPTING MY QUIET THEY'RE DOING THIS OR DOING THAT IN AVIDLY I WOULD CHECK ON THAT. ADDRESS AND THAT UNIT AND FIND OUT THERE WERE NO SECTION EIGHT TENANTS IN THAT BUILDING THERE WERE NO UNITS. THEY WERE ALL MARKET RATE HOUSING. SO. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A POINT IN TIME MY POINT IN ALL THIS THERE WAS A POINT IN TIME WHEN PROPERTY OWNERS. WE'RE PARTNERS BECAUSE THEY NEEDED THERE THEY NEEDED THIS THE CHECK THEY NEEDED THE THE SUPPORT TO TO KEEP THEIR PROPERTY. AS THEIR PROPERTY AND MAKE IT -- VIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AND SO IT WAS FINE. TO ALLOW OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS AT THAT TIME. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE A MARKET THAT IS LESS THAN 5% LESS THAN AND P. AND AND PEOPLE CAN BE MORE CHOOSY AND THEY THINK IF THEY CAN BE MORE PICKY PICKY IN CHOOSING. THEY WILL HAVE BETTER TENNIS IT'S A MYTH IT'S IT'S A FALSE. PREMISE BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE IN THOSE UNITS. THEY TEND TO BE THE ONES THAT FOLLOW THE RULES THAT ARE SO GRATEFUL TO BE GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY'VE WAITED SO LONG. SO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE DISCONNECT HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY WAS SOMEHOW GONE WHEN IT REALLYUSED TO BE THERE FOR FAMILIES. THE DISCRIMINATION WAS LESS LIKELY WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED THE SUPPORT AND THE RESOURCE. SO I JUST FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I KNOW A GUY YEAH WE WE ARE. WE MAYBE SPEND A LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT THIS IS INTERESTING TO ME IN TERMS. OF THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT THE THE ABILITY FOR PROPERTY OWNERS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND MATCHING THAT WITH THE NEED OF PEOPLE WHO JUST ARE ASKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY. TO NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF THE TIME HAVE HAD TO BE VETTED IN ORDER TO EVEN GET. A VOUCHER AND AN OPPORTUNITY SO I WOULD JUST REMIND MY COLLEAGUES -- ABOUT THOSE EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I LIVED IT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AS I TRIED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC THAT THAT COMPLAIN YOU JUST MADE ABOUT THAT PROPERTY I WANT TO KNOW. TO PLEASE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EDUCATE YOU THAT THAT'S MARKET RATE HOUSING THAT IS NOT A PERSON ON A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. SO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY LET THE PROPERTY OWNERS SEE YOU AT FACE VALUE AND AND SEE WHO YOU ARE. AND TAKE A A YOU KNOW TAKE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY VYING FOR HOUSING AND I GUARANTEE YOU -- THOSE ARE THE TENANTS THAT WILL BE YOUR BEST TENANTS I SO APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES FOR OUR BRING IN THIS ITEM FORWARD AGAIN. AND I AGREE AGAIN WITH MY FELLOW SAN DIEGANS EVERYONE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS. THIS IS THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE RIGHT REASONS AND WE HAVE ALL THE PROOF HISTORICALLY WE NEED. THAT IT WORKS. AND IT AND IT'S GOOD SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. SHARKS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT TOM. ORANGE COUNTY TO HAS A LONG WAITING LIST. FOR INDIVIDUALS WAITING FOR A LONG TIME TO GET THEIR VOUCHERS. AND TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR YOU DO GET THE STORIES AS THIS [inaudible] SENATOR FROM. ROLL CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM YOU YOU START TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND YOU YOU. YOU START TO HEAR LANDLORDS GIVE STORIES ABOUT. BAD TENANTS AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS A MYTH. WE WOULD HOPE THAT EVERYONE THAT'S ON THIS PROGRAM AND FINALLY GETS TO BENEFIT FROM IT IS GRATEFUL BUT MAYBE SOME THINK IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT AND THEN. DO NOT -- TREAT THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE RESPECT. THAT THEY SHOULD. OR AND MAYBE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. AND SO THERE IS THIS. FRUSTRATION FROM THE MARKET PLACE WITH WITH THE PROGRAM. AND SO I APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO SO I JUST HAD. ONE OR TWO QUICK QUESTIONS. IF I MAY MISTER PRESIDENT DETERMINES TO INTO QUESTION OF COURSE. I AM SURE. SENATOR THAT YOU HAVE. GONE THROUGH ALL THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOW DEALING WITH PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND I'M WONDERING. IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WOULD BE CONSIDERED UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING. IT IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT REQUIRING THAT A LAND OWNER EXCEPT A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU MUST INCLUDE. YOUR SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER IN YOUR ALREADY ESTABLISHED CRITERIA IN TERMS OF QUITE SURE YOU ESTABLISH AS A LANDLORD FOR RENTING. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IF YOU SIR HAVE A VOUCHER I DO NOT? THAT AS LONG AS BOTH OF US MEET THE SAME BACKGROUND CHECK AND CREDIT CHECK. NOW WE COME OUT EVEN. THAT YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY ELIMINATED FROM CONSIDERATION. BASED ON THE SOURCE OF YOUR INCOME. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT A PORTION OF THE SOURCE OF YOUR INCOME IS A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. IT DOES NOT MANDATE THAT THE LANDLORD ACCEPTED. IT STATES THAT THE LANDLORD DOES NOT GET TO ARBITRARILY -- DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU BASED ON THE SOURCE OF YOUR INCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE ERR ON THE SIDE ON SCENE HEARING NINE ANSWER MISTER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT NOT PRE SHEET THE OPPORTUNITY. LET ME FIRST ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM SANTA MONICA I DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK I FORGOT HIS QUESTION A WITH REGARD -- TO THE INCONSISTENCIES OF HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- PRIMARILY HOUSING AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE STATE DEAL WITH THEIR SECTION EIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES. ON AND I THINK -- YES I'VE GOT OF MUNICIPALITIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT DO VERY WELL AND AS A RESULT A GOOD YOU KNOW LANDLORDS WELCOME SECTION. EIGHT AND I TO HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS POSITIVELY WITH REGARD TO LOS ANGELES. AS DID THE CITY COUNCIL AND OTHERS WHICH IS WHY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY PRODUCED IN THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AGO. A REPORT BACK THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE LOS ANGELES HOUSING COMMUNITY INVESTMENT DEPARTMENT WITH CONSULTATION FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE REPORT REGARDING CITY OR DOES TO PROTECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENTERS. UTILIZING RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME AS PAYMENT. ON PAGE FOUR OF THAT REPORT PAY SIX OF THAT REPORT IT'S STATE PERMISSION TO READ. THANK LATE THANK YOU. HAPLESS. POLICY IS THAT ALL INITIAL INSPECTIONS AND RE INSPECTIONS ARE SCHEDULED WITHIN TWO TO THREE DAYS IF THE UNIT IS READY FOR INSPECTION. HOW COOL IS ALSO WORKING TO PROCESS ANNUAL RATE INCREASES FAMILY AND DOES AND DOES PROCESS RATE INCREASES RETROACTIVELY IF APPLICABLES? AND SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES I HEARD FROM A COLLEAGUE TODAY THAT THEY HEARD THAT IT TAKES AS MUCH AS TWO TO THREE MONTHS. AND SO WE ARE WORKING HARD TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE THE CIVIC LEE FROM. LA COUNTY ABOUT HOW LONG IT REALLY DOES TAKE. AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY I THINK THAT A HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING HAVE HEARD THAT COMPLAINT ARE WORKING HARD. TO REALLY TRY TO CREATE -- MINIMAL DELAYS FOR LANDLORDS IN NAVIGATING THEIR PROCESS. THEY'RE WORKING ACTIVELY TO REDUCE THE TIME FOR INSPECTION SUMMER USING -- PRE INSPECTION PROGRAMS IN REAL TIME ELECTRONIC INSPECTIONS TO REDUCE DELAYS FOR THINK THAT THERE ARE EXAMPLES ALL ACROSS THE STATE -- WHERE TECHNOLOGY ON THIS BEING USED TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS OF? COULD LA COUNTY DO A BETTER JOB. WITHOUT QUESTION ON DOES LA COUNTY PERHAPS HAVE THE LARGEST POOL OF VOUCHERS I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR A FACT BUT BASS IN THE POPULATION I WOULD ASSUME SO. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK ARM IN ARM HAND IN HAND WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FIGURE OUT. IS IT RESOURCES WHAT IS THE CASE BUT TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT GOVERNMENT IS IN CREATING A BOTTLENECK. THAT'S COMPLICATED OUR COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO TAP INTO A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM. TO HELP PEOPLE FAYE HOUSE. THE POPULATION WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE RAISED HERE ON THE FLOOR TODAY AND TALK ABOUT THAT NAUSEAM. BASED ON WHAT WE CAN FRONT ONLY GO HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS EVERY DAY. LASTLY I BELIEVE I WOULD SAY ON A RESPONSE MOM TO CONTINUE THE POINTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. THE POINT OF THE BILL IS TO END DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SOURCE OF INCOME AND I GUESS WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES. WHO WE THINK IS WORTH HELPING? THERE ARE SENIOR VOUCHER PROGRAMS THERE VETERAN VOUCHER PROGRAM. SECTION EIGHT TYPICALLY FOCUSES ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THERE ARE ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM TO HELP THOSE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES COOL IT IS WORTH HELPING. IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL OPINION. YOU KNOW RICHARD GET A BAD RAP. COLLEGE STUDENTS TO RENT. WE HAVE A REAL BIAS AND A PERCEPTION OF THOSE WHO RENT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY AREN'T GONNA VALUE THE PROPERTY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO LIVE. IN -- HEALTHY HABITABLE STANDARDS BUT RENTERS GET A BAD RAP. THE COMMUNITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE I RAN BECAUSE WE'RE HERE FOUR DAYS A WEEK. HAS A STIPULATION THAT YOU CAN'T USE THE BENEFITS OF THE CLUB IN THE POOL IF YOUR RENTER. AND I'M CERTAIN THE RENT ON PAIN PROBABLY COVERS THE WHOLE MORTGAGE ON THE PROPERTY. AND SO RENTERS GET A BAD RAP. AND SO I JUST ASK THAT WE CONSIDER WHAT IS THE REAL ISSUE WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO INCREASE VALUES IN THE SYSTEM IT DOESN'T WORK IN AT AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON HOUSING BIRD ON HOUSING AUTHORITIES BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ADDITIONAL DOCTORS COME INTO THE SYSTEM. WE WORK TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN REALLY OLD HOUSING AUTHORITIES FEET TO THE FIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLICATING THIS PROCESS BY CREATING LONG DELAYS. THE QUESTION IS WHO IS WORK HELPING. AND THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND PREVENT THEM FROM BEING ON THE STREET WERE FAR TOO MANY CURRENTLY ARE. WITH FAST WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION OF SENATE BILL. THREE TWO NINE THANK SENATOR.

IN OUR BEACHES IN OUR STREETS IN OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY COMES FROM CIGARETTE ****. IF YOU'VE EVER DONE A BEACH CLEAN UP OR COMMUNITY CLEAN UP. THE NUMBER OF CIGARETTE **** IS ASTONISHING. THAT ARE LEFT ON THE STREETS MANY OF WHICH COMPRISE PLASTIC MATERIALS THAT ARE DANGEROUS. TODAY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WATER QUALITY. THE CIGARETTE **** ARE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO CLEAN UP OUR WATER. AND INDEED THE COST OF THIS CLEAN UP THE COST OF THE CIGARETTE **** THAT THE GRADE RIGHT THERE ON THE STREET IN IN OUR WATER SOURCES COSTS ARE COMMUNITIES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THE IMPACT OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS CANNOT BE THE MINIMIZED THEY LEACH INTO OUR OF THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS LEACH INTO OUR WATERWAYS OUR MARINE. ENVIRONMENT AFFECTING WATER QUALITY AND ARE CREATING A SIGNIFICANT HAZARD TO WILDLIFE. SO THERE ARE ALSO. NEW CATEGORIES OF PLASTIC ELECTRONIC WASTE RESULTING FROM NEW TOBACCO PRODUCTS SUCH AS E. CIGARETTES AND VAPORIZERS. WHICH CARRY THEIR OWN HARM TO WILDLIFE. THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR WATER SUPPLY. AND WITHOUT SETTING UP A PROGRAM FOR THE COLLECTION OF THESE NEW WASTE TYPES IN COORDINATION WITH THE MANUFACTURERS OF THESE PRODUCTS.

SO SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF TOBACCO WASTE THROUGH A TWO FOLD APPROACH FIRST THE BILL BANS THE SALE OF SPECIFIED SINGLE USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA.

ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF MORLOCKS SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- COLLEAGUES SAID TAX DEDUCTION REDUCES. YOUR INCOME TAX BY THE APPLICABLE TAX RATE SO. A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTION WILL REDUCE YOUR TAXES BY SIXTY DOLLARS IF YOUR TAX RATE IS 6%. BUT A TAX CREDIT. IS A ONE FOR ONE THE SAME ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS REDUCES YOUR INCOME TAX BY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S A RATHER DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF THE STATE TREASURY VERSUS. SIXTY DOLLARS. AND I BELIEVE SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN IS IS IS A VERY VERY GENEROUS TAX EXPENDITURE AND SO THE TAX PREPARERS SIDE OF ME COMES OUT THE BUDGET CONCERNS. COME OUT AND I WOULD SAY THAT WITH A POOR BALANCE SHEET THAT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY HAS AND YOU'LL SEE THAT ONCE IT'S RELEASED SOME. AFTER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.
