IMPORTANT- WE ARE IN

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.527
UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WITH

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:05.761
UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES WHICH

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.730
CALLS FOR UNPRECEDENTED

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.832
SOLUTIONS AND ACTIONS. THE

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.534
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY HAD WE'LL

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.302
KNOW IS REELING AND WE WILL

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.403
CONTINUE TO FACE ECONOMIC

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.739
DIFFICULTIES FOR SOMETIME TO

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.240
COME AND PROBABLY LONGER

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:20.242
PERHAPS THAN ANY OF US WANT TO

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.745
CONTEMPLATE. HOSPITALS AND

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.047
HOSPITAL CAPACITY ARE CRITICAL

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.415
TO OUR ECONOMY AND TO

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.250
STRENGTHENING THE CALIFORNIA

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.152
WORK FORCE IN TWO IMPORTANT

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:32.988
WAYS FIRST HOSPITAL CAPACITY IS

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.157
KEY TO RE OPENING THE STATE'S

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:37.626
ECONOMY WE CANNOT REOPEN THE

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.462
ECONOMY UNLESS HOSPITALS ARE

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:42.665
BOTH AVAILABLE AND STAFFED. AND

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:43.866
IF HOSPITALS CAN'T REMAIN

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.768
STRONG INSOLVENT WE ARE ALL IN

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:49.004
JEOPARDY WHEN CODED RISES AND

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:51.374
WE ALL FULLY EXPECT IT WILL AS

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.109
THE STAY AT HOME ORDER IS

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:53.609
LIFTED AND WE BEGIN TO

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.412
INTERMINGLE AGAIN AND IF CODED

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.848
RESURGENCE. CALIFORNIA'S

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:00.916
CONFIDENCE IN DAILY LIFE CANNOT

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.585
BE RESTORED UNLESS HOSPITALS

01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:05.488
ARE FUNDED STABLE AND

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:06.922
OPERATIONAL. AND THE SECOND WAY

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:08.224
IN WHICH HOSPITAL CAPACITY IS

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:10.159
CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY AND THE

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:11.427
STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:14.130
WORKFORCE IS BECAUSE HOSPITALS

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.865
ARE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:17.867
KEEP CALIFORNIA WORKING.

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:19.468
HOSPITALS ARE AMONG THE LARGEST

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:20.736
PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS IN

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:24.206
CALIFORNIA WE EMPLOY FIVE

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.007
HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS A HALF

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:27.910
A MILLION. WE SUPPORT ANOTHER

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.011
ONE POINT TWO MILLION JOBS IN

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.379
THE STATE AND WE ARE

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:32.448
RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO HUNDRED AND

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.250
EIGHTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:35.985
TOTAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:38.454
CALIFORNIA. HOSPITALS OFFERS

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:40.322
SOLID MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WITH

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:42.892
BENEFITS AND THAT IS WHAT WE

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:45.728
NEED AT THE STATE TO RECOVER

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.897
ECONOMICALLY. BUT THE IMPACT OF

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.331
CORONAVIRUS ON CALIFORNIA'S

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:51.167
HOSPITALS HAS BEEN AND

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:54.437
CONTINUES TO BE DEVASTATING.

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:57.106
AND I AM NOT ONE WHO IS PRONE

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:59.875
TO HYPERBOLE. I DO NOT USE THAT

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:01.744
WORD LIGHTLY BUT THE IMPACT

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.712
HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING.

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.414
HOSPITALS WERE ASKED TO PREPARE

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:09.452
TWO THIRDS 4250% THAT MEANS TO

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:16.125
CARE. FOR THIRTY. AND WE DID

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:18.294
THAT WE ANSWERED THAT CALL WE

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.296
EMPTIED CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.064
TO MAKE WAY THAT MEANS

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.966
CANCELING SURGERIES AND

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.635
PROCEDURES AND MORE IT IS WHAT

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:29.138
WE DO AND IT IS AND WAS AND

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.473
CONTINUES TO BE THE RIGHT THING

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.875
TO DO. BUT AS WE BEGIN THE

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.077
ASSESSED THE DAMAGE OF THE TOLL

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:38.247
IS ENORMOUS AND I WILL SAY IT

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.949
IS A TOOL THAT IS DIFFERENT.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:41.851
THAN THE TOLL TAKEN ON OTHER

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.119
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THAT

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:45.855
IS BECAUSE HOSPITALS HAVE NOT

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.557
ONLY LOST REVENUE. BUT WE ALSO

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.759
HAD TO REMAIN OPEN AND FULLY

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.895
STAFFED AS WE WERE DEALING WITH

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:56.899
THIS COVE AND CRISIS. SO

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.034
HOSPITAL REVENUE LOST. AN

01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:01.570
AVERAGE OF 2230% WE BELIEVE TO

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:03.439
DATE MORE FOR SOME OF OUR

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.241
SMALLER RURAL HOSPITALS WHERE

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:06.742
THE LOSS OF JUST A FEW

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.978
PROCEDURES OUT REALLY MAKE UP

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:12.815
THE BULK OF THEIR REVENUE. THAT

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:15.351
2230% IN TERMS OF REVENUE

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.887
LOSSES FOR US. ACCOUNTS FOR

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.356
ABOUT TEN TO FOURTEEN BILLION

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:23.125
DOLLARS IN LOSSES BOTTOM LINE

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.094
IS HOSPITALS ARE DESPERATE FOR

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.796
CASH. SO WE'RE ADDING TO THAT

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:30.399
THE COST OF COVERT PREPARATIONS

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.601
AND THAT INCLUDED CONSTRUCTION.

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:33.869
THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.070
WHETHER THAT WAS VENTILATORS

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:36.105
WERE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.307
EQUIPMENT INTENDED TO KEEP OUR

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:40.976
WORKERS SAFE. AND PARTICIPATING

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:42.978
IN STANDING UP ALTERNATIVE CARE

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:44.980
SITES THESE ADDITIONAL SITES

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:47.082
INTENDED TO BE CAN'T HOSPITALS

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:48.083
A NUMBER OF HOSPITALS WERE

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.152
INVOLVED IN- IN SETTING THOSE

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:53.222
UP. AND STAFFING THOSE AS WELL.

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:55.791
AND ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES OF

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:57.359
COURSE DAMAGE HOSPITALS LONG

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:59.061
TERM FINANCIAL STRENGTHS.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.330
LIQUIDITY HOSPITALS ABILITY TO

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.198
BORROW HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:05.334
TAKE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS AND

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:08.070
MORE. SO HOSPITAL TO DONE THEIR

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.872
BEST TO KEEP STAFF THROUGH ALL

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:12.775
OF THIS WE NEED NURSES AN

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:14.343
ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES WORKERS

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.412
AND RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS AND

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:19.715
MANY MANY MORE BUT FOR LOW'S

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:22.017
AND LAY OFF HAVE BEGUN. WE HAVE

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.619
SEEN SOME HOSPITALS NOW

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.588
BEGINNING TO CUT OURS WERE

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:28.524
CHOIR PAID TIME OFF BE TAKEN OR

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.726
PAY REDUCTIONS AND N SOME

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.995
CASES A COUPLE OF LARGE SCALE

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.464
POSITION ELIMINATION. AND THAT

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:39.068
IS BECAUSE 60% OF HOSPITALS

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:41.437
SPENDING IS FOR LABOR ANOTHER

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.906
15% FOR THE SUPPLIES REQUIRED

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.441
TO PROVIDE CARE SO THREE

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:48.344
QUARTERS OF HOSPITAL SPENDING.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.579
IS ON THE PEOPLE AND THE THINGS

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.081
NEEDED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.549
TO ALL OF US LEADING HOSPITAL

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.684
VERY LITTLE ROOM TO DEAL WITH

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:57.286
THESE ENORMOUS IMMEDIATE

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.655
LOSSES. SO WE NEED TO DO WHAT

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:02.057
WE CAN TO STOP THE FINANCIAL

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:05.361
BLEEDING. FEDERAL RELIEF IS NOT

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.830
ENOUGH. TO DATE HOSPITALS IN

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:09.932
CALIFORNIA HAVE RECEIVED A

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:11.800
LITTLE LESS THAN THREE BILLION

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:14.803
WE EXPECT THAT OF THE SEVENTY

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.805
BILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED TO

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:18.841
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OUT WE

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.409
WILL FEATURE A SLIGHTLY MORE

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.710
THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.912
COMING TO HOSPITALS. IT IS

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.981
UNCLEAR HOW MUCH MORE AID WILL

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.983
BE COMING TO HOSPITALS FROM THE

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:31.320
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND AS THEY

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:34.823
CONTINUE TO EXPAND NOT CONTRACT

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.892
THE POOL OF POSSIBLE RECIPIENTS

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.994
IT IS MAKING HOSPITALS SHARE OF

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:42.297
THE FEDERAL DOLLARS SMALLER AND

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.333
SMALLER AND SMALLER. SO THERE

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.868
IS NO QUESTION THAT WE WILL

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:47.770
NEED THE STATE HELP AND THERE

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.004
ARE TWO THINGS NEEDED

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:51.173
IMMEDIATELY FIRST OF ALL YOUR

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.242
HELP AND THE GOVERNOR'S HELP IN

01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:54.677
BRINGING INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.478
AND HEALTH PLANS TO THE TABLE

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:58.814
IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. IT WAS

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:00.816
JUST MENTIONED THAT SOME HEALTH

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:03.752
PLANS ARE PROVIDING LOANS OR

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.120
XCELERATED PAYMENTS TO

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:07.456
HOSPITALS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.458
WE ARE SEEING THAT IN VERY FEW

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:12.795
CASES MORE IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:15.531
LOCAL HEALTH PLANS- BUT FAR

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:17.833
LESS IN TERMS OF PRIVATE

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.102
INSURANCE COMPANIES. HOSPITAL

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.037
SHOULD BE PAID FOR THEIR UNPAID

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:24.707
CLAIMS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.141
INSURANCE COMPANIES RIGHT NOW

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:28.410
HAVE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY THAT

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:30.379
ARE BEING HELD NORMALLY CLAIMS

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:32.715
THAT ARE PROCESSED AND CAN TAKE

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:34.083
AS MUCH AS NINETY DAYS. MEANING

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.918
DOLLARS ARE BEING HELD BY

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:37.119
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.954
PLANS FOR CARE THAT WAS

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:39.888
PROVIDED IN THE MONTH OF

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.957
FEBRUARY WE NEED TO MOVE THOSE

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.959
DOLLARS MORE QUICKLY. AND

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.861
IMMEDIATELY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:48.931
TO HOSPITALS THAT MONEY NEEDS

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:50.466
TO GET TO HOSPITALS NOW.

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:51.867
VOLUNTARY ADVANCE PAYMENT

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:53.602
PROGRAMS AND EASING THE

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:55.137
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN TO SPEED

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.372
PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS IS ALSO

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.675
CRITICAL- WE DID INCLUDE THAT

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.176
IN A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR ON

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:02.778
APRIL THE FIFTEENTH THAT

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:05.748
IMMEDIATE SHOT OF LIQUIDITY IS

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:08.050
NEEDED NOW. AND SECOND WE HAVE

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:10.018
REALLY NO CHOICE BUT TO ASK THE

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:16.371
WORSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:37.059
MEAN THAT POSITIONS WILL MAKE

YEAR- IN REGARDS TO NURSING

01:53:14.687 --> 01:53:17.123

GOING THROUGH THIS- BUT MY-

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:26.733
QUESTION REQUEST- IS I KNOW

THAT- WHEN A NURSING STUDENT

01:53:28.768 --> 01:53:31.337

THIRD CERTIFICATION HOWEVER

01:53:41.347 --> 01:53:44.817
BECAUSE OF MBANK THEY'RE NOT

ABLE TO TAKE THOSE COURSES AND

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:48.855
I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR- ROUTE

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:50.757
CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT

01:53:50.823 --> 01:53:52.992
THEY CAN DO SIMULATION RATHER

01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:55.895
THAN BEING IN THE HOSPITALS

01:53:55.962 --> 01:53:56.829
FOUR FIVE TO GET BACK TO AYE

01:53:56.896 --> 01:53:58.698
TRAINING HOWEVER FROM WHAT I

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:02.635
UNDERSTAND THE PERCENTAGE IS

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:03.903
ALMOST REACHED AND IT'S

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:06.139
STARTING UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:08.408
NURSES. CAN SEED WITH THEIR

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:10.009
CERTIFICATION BECAUSE NOW THEY

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:12.845
CAN GET THE TRAINING IN THE

01:54:12.912 --> 01:54:14.647
HOSPITALS SO IS THERE ANY

01:54:14.714 --> 01:54:18.585
CONVERSATION OR ANY- JUST

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:21.688
COMMENTS ABOUT CHANGING THAT

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:23.122
REQUIREMENT GAME I BELIEVE HE

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:24.958
CHANGED IT 250% ON THIRD-

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:27.360
TRAINING TO BE DONE I COULD BE

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:29.295
DONE THROUGH A SIMULATION IF

01:54:29.362 --> 01:54:31.497
THEY REACH THAT ONE IS THERE A

01:54:31.564 --> 01:54:35.235
PLAN TO CHANGE THAT OR GOING

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:37.537
FORWARD IS DURING THE PLAN ON

01:54:37.604 --> 01:54:39.272
MAKING SURE THAT THESE NURSES

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:41.674
ARE READY TO GRADUATE AS SOON

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:42.976
AS THEY THEIR THEIR CLINICAL

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:47.347
HOURS. WE MOVE THEM FORWARD

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:49.282
BECAUSE I THINK. THE D. UP WORK

01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:50.950
IS GOING TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:53.620
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC I'M-

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:54.954
JUST THINKING AHEAD THAT SOME

01:54:55.021 --> 01:54:58.124
OF THESE NURSING- NURSES ARE

01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:00.293
GOING TO BE EXHAUSTED OR OR A

01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:01.828
LOT OF THEM WILL RETIRE GET OUT

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:04.564
OF THE FIELD AFTER THIS- FOR

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:06.099
VARIOUS REASONS AND IS THERE

01:55:06.165 --> 01:55:08.635
ANY PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:10.670
THESE NURSING STUDENTS GAP. GET

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:11.738
THE APPROPRIATE CERTIFICATION

01:55:11.804 --> 01:55:14.207
SO THAT WE CAN PLAN FOR FUTURE-

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:18.811
WORK FORCE- IF AND WHEN IF THE

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:21.080
SURGE DOES OCCUR OR JUST

01:55:21.147 --> 01:55:22.515
LOOKING FORWARD WE NEED TO MAKE

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:23.850
SURE THAT NURSES NURSING

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:26.219
STUDENTS. ARE CERTIFIED SO IF

01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:27.353
WE NEED THEM AND THEN FUTURE

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:28.321
THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE IT'S

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:29.622
LIKE A LONG WINDED BUT AGAIN

01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:31.524
BUT THE QUESTION IS- IS DURING

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:32.892
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CHANGING

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:36.396
THE REQUIRED CLINICAL HOURS- TO

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:39.032
DO MORE- THE SIMULATION RATHER

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:45.772
THAN IN HOUSE TRAINING. AND IT

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:48.007
CANNELLA COIL ON AT EIGHT THINK

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:49.642
THAT QUESTION MAYBE OF ME- I DO

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:51.711
NOT HAVE ALL OF THE DETAILS ON

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:53.246
THE LATEST CONVERSATIONS WHEN I

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:55.181
CAN SAY IS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:56.783
CAREFULLY TO TRY TO MAKE

01:55:56.849 --> 01:55:58.217
CERTAIN THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

01:55:58.284 --> 01:55:59.886
GET OUR NURSING STUDENTS THE

01:55:59.952 --> 01:56:01.321
TRAINING THAT THEY NEED YOU'RE

01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:02.355
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE'S

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:03.323
NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN

01:56:03.389 --> 01:56:05.625
STRENGTHENING OUR WORKFORCE AT

THERE WERE INCREASED COSTS THAT

02:01:45.998 --> 02:01:49.301
WERE ATTRIBUTED FROM- PP OR

02:01:49.368 --> 02:01:51.904

BEGINNING YEAR IS NOT NECESSARY

02:12:34.446 --> 02:12:38.183
WE TO. ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:40.085
IS WE BELIEVE CAUSING A SHIFT

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:41.853
OF EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE TO

MEDICARE PROGRAM WHICH IS GOING

02:12:47.726 --> 02:12:50.996
TO SEE AN INCREASE OF-

02:12:51.063 --> 02:12:51.563
ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:53.098
ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO

02:12:53.165 --> 02:12:55.133

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:07.813
RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE

02:13:07.879 --> 02:13:10.882
CORONA SO YOU FACTOR THAT IN

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:12.651
YOU FACTOR IN THE UNKNOWN COST

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:15.620
OF CARE ONCE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM

02:13:15.687 --> 02:13:17.823

EACH PLAN IS DIFFERENT IS

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.568
SITUATED DIFFERENTLY- SOME OF

02:14:03.635 --> 02:14:04.903
THEM ARE SMALL READABLE

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:06.471
REGIONAL THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:08.874
SAME LEVEL. OF FINANCIAL

IF OUR ACCESS AND SERVICES ARE

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:55.654

HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS I

02:16:03.922 --> 02:16:06.591
THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE RIGHT NOW

02:16:06.658 --> 02:16:08.260
FOR US TO SUPPORT OUR HEALTH

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:11.496

02:16:19.638 --> 02:16:21.840
FINAL QUESTION AND THEN- AND

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:24.309
THIS IS A QUESTION- FOR CARMELO

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:25.510
BUT I WANT TO FRAME THIS A

02:16:25.577 --> 02:16:27.045
LITTLE BIT BEFORE I ASK THE

02:16:27.112 --> 02:16:30.582
QUESTION. WE KNOW THAT- THE

02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:32.584
HOSPITALS ARE FACING-

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:36.321
SIGNIFICANT- DEADLINES AND PUT

02:16:36.388 --> 02:16:38.390
AN X. AND LARGE EXPENDITURES

02:16:38.456 --> 02:16:41.993
RELATED TO SEISMIC RETROFITS- I

02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:44.362
THINK OF- DOCTOR ARAMBULA HAS A

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:45.397
HOSPITAL IN THE PHRASE IN THE

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:49.801
FRESNO COUNTY. THAT 90% OF THE

02:16:49.868 --> 02:16:51.836
HOSPITAL IS EITHER MEDICARE OR

02:16:51.903 --> 02:16:54.439
MEDIC CAL. AND THE COST FOR THE

02:16:54.506 --> 02:16:56.274
SEISMIC RETROFIT IS ABOUT A

02:16:56.341 --> 02:16:57.809
BILLION DOLLARS IF THEY WERE TO

02:16:57.876 --> 02:16:59.611
REBUILD THE HOSPITAL IT WOULD

02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:01.646
BE TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AT A

02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:05.784
TIME WHEN REVENUE IS- SHE HAS

02:17:05.850 --> 02:17:08.253
BEEN SHAKEN SO BADLY THAT-

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:10.255
HOSPITALS ARE LAYING OFF. I

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:12.624
BELIEVE AND I I'M I DON'T KNOW

02:17:12.691 --> 02:17:13.725
WHY THIS NUMBER STICKS IN MY

02:17:13.792 --> 02:17:15.560
MIND BUT IT DOES. THAT TOTAL

02:17:15.627 --> 02:17:18.063
COST TO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM-

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:19.698
HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:17:19.764 --> 02:17:21.600
IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR

02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:24.803
BILLION DOLLARS. SO I ASKED

02:17:24.869 --> 02:17:26.638
THIS QUESTION IN A BUDGET-

02:17:26.705 --> 02:17:28.740
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING. OVERSIGHT

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:30.875
HEARING TWO WEEKS AGO-

02:17:30.942 --> 02:17:33.044
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- I

02:17:33.111 --> 02:17:36.181
WANT TO ASK- TO- OUR FOLKS AT-

02:17:36.247 --> 02:17:39.250
DH CS- IN ANYBODY ANYONE ELSE

02:17:39.317 --> 02:17:41.453
WHO WANTS ANSWER. AFTER I GIVE

02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:44.422
CARMELLA CHANCE TO ANSWER- WHAT

02:17:44.489 --> 02:17:45.824
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS I THINK

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:48.126
THAT- WE HAVE HOSPITALS ARE ON

02:17:48.193 --> 02:17:50.428
THE EDGE RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE

02:17:50.495 --> 02:17:52.497
HOSPITALS IT WILL NOT SURVIVE.

02:17:52.564 --> 02:17:55.166
AND THIS- YOU KNOW WITHOUT A

02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:57.369
CHANGE IN THE DEADLINE OR SOME

02:17:57.435 --> 02:17:58.837
RESTRUCTURING OF WHAT HOW WE

02:17:58.903 --> 02:18:01.306
LOOK AT SEISMIC RETROFITS-

02:18:01.373 --> 02:18:03.608
WE'RE GONNA LOSE HOSPITALS-

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:06.578
GOING FORWARD AT A TIME WHEN WE

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:09.047
NEED THEM THE MOST- CARRILLO I

02:18:09.114 --> 02:18:10.015
KNOW YOU. TALKED ABOUT A

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:12.550
BILLION DOLLAR ASK- IS THEY'RE

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:14.185
ALSO GOING TO BE AN ASK AROUND

02:18:14.252 --> 02:18:16.588
SEISMIC- BECAUSE I AM REALLY

02:18:16.655 --> 02:18:20.625
CONCERNED- IN ONE OF MY

02:18:20.692 --> 02:18:21.826
HOSPITALS IN IN OUR HUMBLE

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:24.162
COUNTY- IT'S WITH STOOD-

02:18:24.229 --> 02:18:26.097
EARTHQUAKES IN THE SEVEN POINT

02:18:26.164 --> 02:18:29.300
OH RANGE- AND NEVER LOST A DAY

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:31.469
OF SERVICE FOR EARTHQUAKE-

02:18:31.536 --> 02:18:32.937
BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE. YES THEY

02:18:33.004 --> 02:18:34.739
MAY HAVE HAD TO LAY OFF THE

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:36.675
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:38.443
AND THAT THEY ARE FACING HUGE

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:42.480
COSTS FOR- FOR RETROFIT SO-

02:18:42.547 --> 02:18:43.782
IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE

02:18:43.848 --> 02:18:45.183
ABOUT THE STATE AND OBVIOUSLY

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:47.385
WANT PEOPLE TO BE SAFE-

02:18:47.452 --> 02:18:49.888
HOWEVER- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:51.389
BE AT A POINT. OF DO WE

02:18:51.456 --> 02:18:55.427
BANKRUPT HOSPITALS- OR DO WE-

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:57.495
TO WE TRY WE DO DO WE- TAKE A

02:18:57.562 --> 02:18:58.797
LITTLE BIT A DIFFERENT A

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:00.598
DIFFERENT APPROACH SO THAT WE

02:19:00.665 --> 02:19:02.600
CAN KEEP HOSPITALS OPEN SO. I

02:19:02.667 --> 02:19:04.836
GUESS I'D LIKE TO HAVE CARMELO-

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:06.337
COMMENT ON THAT AND THEN I'M

02:19:06.404 --> 02:19:09.007
OPEN TO- TEAMMATE CD EIGHT C.

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:11.676
S. WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER THAT

02:19:11.743 --> 02:19:13.878
AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO

02:19:13.945 --> 02:19:14.879
MUCH DOCTOR WOULD FOR THE

02:19:14.946 --> 02:19:17.015
QUESTION- YOUR NUMBERS ARE SPOT

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:19.150
ON- THE CITIES ARE A COST

02:19:19.217 --> 02:19:20.919
ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING THE

02:19:20.985 --> 02:19:22.287
TWENTY THIRTY. SEISMIC

02:19:22.353 --> 02:19:24.222
REQUIREMENTS THAT EXCEED A

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:25.757
HUNDRED BILLION THAT HUNDRED

02:19:25.824 --> 02:19:27.125
AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:29.127
NUMBER. AND WHILE WE HAVE BEEN

02:19:29.194 --> 02:19:31.629
TALKING ABOUT THAT CHALLENGE.

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:34.666
AND THE INCREDIBLE- DIFFICULTY

02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:36.801
ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING TO MEET

02:19:36.868 --> 02:19:39.037
THAT BEFORE CODED. IT REALLY

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:41.673
BECOMES AN IMPOSSIBILITY GIVEN

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:43.375
WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES AT THIS

02:19:43.441 --> 02:19:45.877
JUNCTURE. AND SO I WHILE WE'RE

02:19:45.944 --> 02:19:47.645
ALL VERY FOCUSED ON THE

02:19:47.712 --> 02:19:49.848
IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM FINANCIAL

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:51.783
NEEDS OF THE HOSPITAL FIELD.

02:19:51.850 --> 02:19:53.318
THIS TEN TO FOURTEEN BILLION

02:19:53.384 --> 02:19:54.953
DOLLARS. AND WHILE WE

02:19:55.019 --> 02:19:56.688
APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:58.690
INSURERS IT IS TIME FOR ACTION

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:01.559
NOT CONVERSATIONS. IT IS TIME

02:20:01.626 --> 02:20:03.795
FOR SYSTEMATIC CHANGE NOT CASE

02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:07.398
BY CASE. EVALUATIONS BUT WHAT'S

02:20:07.465 --> 02:20:09.267
HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:10.902
IT'S NOT JUST THE SHORT TERM

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:12.904
IMPACT. ON THE HOSPITAL AND

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:15.006
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IT IS THE

02:20:15.073 --> 02:20:17.809
LONG TERM DEPLETION OF THE

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:19.144
FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THAT

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:21.146
SYSTEM. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

02:20:21.212 --> 02:20:22.647
SOMETHING LIKE SEISMIC

CENTERS BECAUSE WE REALLY

02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:33.296

WAY THAT WE COULD HAVE THOSE

02:49:57.921 --> 02:49:59.622
ALTERNATIVES WITH OUR EXISTING

02:49:59.689 --> 02:50:01.591
RESOURCES. WE HAVE A REMARKABLE

02:50:01.658 --> 02:50:03.693

02:50:12.602 --> 02:50:15.071
CREATIVE. AND VERY NIMBLE AND

02:50:26.316 --> 02:50:28.518
HAVE TO BE AWARE OF TO BE ABLE

02:50:28.585 --> 02:50:30.620
TO ADJUST. AND HEAD THAT AND

02:50:30.687 --> 02:50:31.955
MAYBE TAKE A LOOK AT

02:50:32.021 --> 02:50:34.457
ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES- LASTLY

02:50:34.524 --> 02:50:36.059
WE REALLY WANTED TO BE VERY

02:50:36.125 --> 02:50:37.660
FOCUSED ON COMMUNICATION NOT

02:50:37.727 --> 02:50:39.529
ONLY COMMUNICATION THROUGHOUT

02:50:39.596 --> 02:50:40.563
THE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE THE

02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:43.032

SAFETY WE WERE THE- A I SAID

02:51:00.083 --> 02:51:00.917
WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE

02:51:00.984 --> 02:51:02.719
CAN. THAT RISK ANDEXPOSURE TO

02:51:02.785 --> 02:51:05.388

PROVIDERS- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

02:51:08.958 --> 02:51:10.493
AT THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ONE

FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT WE

02:51:12.128 --> 02:51:14.163
NEEDED TO DO WAS TO MINIMIZE.

02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:15.498
ANY EXPOSURE IN CONGREGATE

02:51:15.565 --> 02:51:18.267
SETTING AND SO HAVING THE

02:51:18.334 --> 02:51:20.303
DIFFICULT DECISION TO RESTRICT-

02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:23.640
ADMISSION AND- GETS CHARGES

02:51:23.706 --> 02:51:25.408
FROM CERTAIN STUDYING SO WE CAN

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:26.509
REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:29.178
WE- TAPE THAT HAVE TO BE ABLE

02:51:29.245 --> 02:51:31.514
TO STABILIZE. AND NOT PROVIDE

02:51:31.581 --> 02:51:33.816
THAT EXPOSURE TO A VULNERABLE

02:51:33.883 --> 02:51:36.419
POPULATION. THAT BAD WE ALSO

02:51:36.486 --> 02:51:37.620

SUPPORT THEM AN ALTERNATIVE

02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:43.359
WAY. WE DON'T CENTERS WORKING

02:51:43.426 --> 02:51:45.428
VERY VERY HARD AND IDENTIFYING

02:51:45.495 --> 02:51:46.696
CAPACITY THAT THEY COULD

02:51:46.763 --> 02:51:48.164
DEVELOP IS WHAT WE CALL FOR

EXACERBATED THE RECESSION.

03:30:01.255 --> 03:30:02.556

HUMAN COST OF THE PROPERTY

03:30:17.371 --> 03:30:20.074
THINKING IT IS SIGNIFICANT-

03:30:20.140 --> 03:30:22.176
WE'VE SEEN THAT NUMBER COULD I

03:30:22.242 --> 03:30:23.644
TALK ABOUT IN DIRECTOR JOHN

03:30:23.711 --> 03:30:25.112
GOING T TALK ABOUT REALLY

03:30:25.179 --> 03:30:28.315
SPEAKS TO. THAT THE LARGE

03:30:28.382 --> 03:30:29.249
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:30:29.316 --> 03:30:30.617
TEETERING ON THE EDGE IN HER

03:30:30.684 --> 03:30:32.319
EXPERIENCE BEING ECONOMIC AND

03:30:32.386 --> 03:30:34.621
SECURITY. ARE COUNTY BROUGHT

03:30:34.688 --> 03:30:35.856
THAT WOULD NOT SIGNIFICANT

03:30:35.923 --> 03:30:37.591
PLAYERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION

03:30:37.658 --> 03:30:38.359
OF HOMELESSNESS SERVICES

03:30:38.425 --> 03:30:39.960
INCLUDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

03:30:40.027 --> 03:30:43.931
PROJECT ROOM KEY. AND WE ARE

03:30:43.998 --> 03:30:44.398
SEEING AN INCREASE IN

03:30:44.465 --> 03:30:45.432
HOMELESSNESS. WE VERY MUCH

03:30:45.499 --> 03:30:46.467
APPRECIATE THE EXECUTIVE

03:30:46.533 --> 03:30:48.836
ORDERS. THAT HAD MADE IT EASIER

03:30:48.902 --> 03:30:50.771
FOR PEOPLE TO GET AND TO KEEP

03:30:50.838 --> 03:30:52.506
THEIR BENEFIT. WE STRONGLY

03:30:52.573 --> 03:30:54.475
ADVOCATED FOR THEM AND WORKED

03:30:54.541 --> 03:30:56.577
REALLY HARD TO IMPLEMENT THAT

03:30:56.643 --> 03:30:57.144
AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE

03:30:57.211 --> 03:31:00.114
GOVERNOR- LEADERSHIP AND

03:31:00.180 --> 03:31:02.149
PUTTING THEM FOR. WE THINK THAT

03:31:02.216 --> 03:31:04.218
THERE SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION

03:31:04.284 --> 03:31:05.552
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY

03:31:05.619 --> 03:31:07.955
SHOULD EXTEND BEYOND JUNE- AND

03:31:08.022 --> 03:31:10.124
I THINK WE NEED TO- LOOK AT

03:31:10.190 --> 03:31:11.458
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY

03:31:11.525 --> 03:31:13.761
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING- IN THE

03:31:13.827 --> 03:31:15.429
ECONOMY THAT FAMILIES AND LOW

03:31:15.496 --> 03:31:18.432
INCOME PEOPLE TO SEE. WHICH OF

03:31:18.499 --> 03:31:20.200
THOSE. FEATURES THAT WERE

03:31:20.267 --> 03:31:22.469
ISSUED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

03:31:22.536 --> 03:31:24.004
MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE

03:31:24.071 --> 03:31:25.305
AND THE CABLE CALVET TIME

03:31:25.372 --> 03:31:27.941
LIMIT- I THINK THAT THE-

03:31:28.008 --> 03:31:29.810
RECESSION IN THE PANDEMIC.

03:31:29.877 --> 03:31:31.845
DEMONSTRATE CONCLUSIVELY THAT

03:31:31.912 --> 03:31:33.881
THEY DON'T HELP. ARM AND THEY

03:31:33.947 --> 03:31:36.884
SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY REMOVED

03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:37.951
FROM THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. BUT

03:31:38.018 --> 03:31:39.053
WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

03:31:39.119 --> 03:31:40.554
EXTRA RESOURCES THAT THE

03:31:40.621 --> 03:31:41.455
GOVERNOR IS PUT INTO

03:31:41.522 --> 03:31:43.190
HOMELESSNESS THE CREATIVITY THE

03:31:43.257 --> 03:31:44.058
LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

SOCIAL SERVICES. I'M WE BELIEVE

03:31:46.693 --> 03:31:47.694
THAT THOSE LESSONS THAT WE

03:31:47.761 --> 03:31:48.829
LEARNED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

03:31:48.896 --> 03:31:51.098
OF THOSE PROGRAMS- THAT MIGHT

03:31:51.165 --> 03:31:53.434
SUBJECT PERMANENT WAYS THAT WE

03:31:53.500 --> 03:31:55.069
CAN- COME TO THINK THAT WE CAN

03:31:55.135 --> 03:31:57.704
DO AS WE MOVE FORWARD- TO KEEP

03:31:57.771 --> 03:31:58.605

03:32:09.850 --> 03:32:13.987
LOOK AT FUTURE WE'RE NOT WELL

03:32:14.054 --> 03:32:14.555
CUNNINGHAM INTERPRETED EIGHT

03:32:14.621 --> 03:32:16.790

GO FURTHER BY ALLOWING PEOPLE

BRING IT'S NOT LIKE FIXING A

03:34:15.008 --> 03:34:18.512

03:34:18.579 --> 03:34:20.013
EVERYTHING THAT WE POSSIBLY

03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:23.016

CUT. TO BENEFIT LEVEL. WE DID

03:34:49.643 --> 03:34:50.644
NOT PROVIDE INFLATION

03:34:50.711 --> 03:34:52.746
ADJUSTMENT COULD BENEFIT LEVELS

03:34:52.813 --> 03:34:55.515
AND WE DID BECAUSE IT IS ONE

03:34:55.582 --> 03:34:56.450
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN

03:34:56.516 --> 03:35:00.187

HAVE HOPE IN DARK TIMES WHEN HE

04:02:44.850 --> 04:02:47.219
WAS STRUGGLING. AND I LOOK

04:02:47.286 --> 04:02:49.688
TOWARDS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

04:02:49.755 --> 04:02:52.257
SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY

04:02:52.324 --> 04:02:54.359

04:06:19.564 --> 04:06:21.266
WORKING ON THE ACT. CAPABILITY

THE DARKISH FEEDBACK CAN BE. A

04:06:26.505 --> 04:06:27.739
MORE PERMANENT IN ANY COMPONENT

BELIEVE THAT. TIME CLOCKS

04:06:48.693 --> 04:06:51.096
REALLY DON'T ALLOW THIS PROGAM

04:06:51.163 --> 04:06:53.064
TO BE EFFECTIVE DURING THIS

04:06:53.131 --> 04:06:54.933

STRATEGIES- AND MAKING SRE

04:10:42.594 --> 04:10:44.963
THAT THEY HADTHE FLEXIBILITY

04:10:45.029 --> 04:10:47.098
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT-

04:10:47.165 --> 04:10:48.833
NONRESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS TO

RESULT CENTERS THAT THEIR THEIR

04:11:14.225 --> 04:11:16.294

NINETEEN- AND THAT'S BEEN AN

04:11:43.288 --> 04:11:44.589
IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT WE

04:11:44.656 --> 04:11:46.991
DON'T CENTERS HAVE ASKED US-

04:11:47.058 --> 04:11:48.793

IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE

04:12:10.949 --> 04:12:12.417
BEING RESPONSIVE TO A CALL THAT

04:12:12.484 --> 04:12:14.886
FAMILIES ARE MADE INTO THEM AND

04:12:14.953 --> 04:12:17.322

IS THAT- HARD CASES OFTEN

THE DECISION THAT WE'RE GOING

04:34:38.795 --> 04:34:40.230
TO STOP WELFARE TO WORK AND

04:34:40.297 --> 04:34:42.966
HAVE FAMILY STAYING HOME FOR-

04:34:43.033 --> 04:34:44.301
FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME

04:34:44.367 --> 04:34:46.269
WHILE THEY'RE FEDERAL TIME

04:34:46.336 --> 04:34:49.406
CLOCKS RAN- BUT- YOU KNOW THAT

04:34:49.472 --> 04:34:52.609
REALLY WELL. VERY THEY HAD A

04:34:52.676 --> 04:34:54.110
SHORT TIME CLOCK FOR FEDERAL

04:34:54.177 --> 04:34:56.246
PURPOSES AND THEN WE DID BRING

THEY WEREN'T PREPARED. TO

04:35:01.885 --> 04:35:04.554
ENGAGE PEOPLE AND SO MANY TIMES

04:35:04.621 --> 04:35:06.289
FAMILY SPENT WEEKS MONTHS OF

04:35:06.356 --> 04:35:08.291
WAITING TO GET CHILDCARE OTHER

LEGAL SERVICES INTERVENTION.

04:35:14.364 --> 04:35:15.999
AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT

04:35:16.066 --> 04:35:17.500
THE IMPACT I THINK YOU'RE GOING

04:35:17.567 --> 04:35:18.702
TO BE AND I THINK THE WITNESS

04:35:18.768 --> 04:35:19.369
THAT YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER

04:35:19.436 --> 04:35:22.606

PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY BIG

04:35:24.674 --> 04:35:26.343
CHALLENGES IN LIFE AND THAT THE

04:35:26.409 --> 04:35:27.744
NOTION THAT WE CAN GET EVERYONE

04:35:27.811 --> 04:35:29.246

04:35:29.312 --> 04:35:31.181
WORKING FORTY EIGHT MONTHS IS

04:35:31.248 --> 04:35:33.183
JUST SIMPLY NOT TRUE PEOPLE ARE

04:35:33.250 --> 04:35:35.185
IN DIFFERENT PLACES. NOW I

04:35:35.252 --> 04:35:37.954
THINK. NOW WE'VE SEEN TWO MAJOR

04:35:38.021 --> 04:35:40.123
RECESSIONS IN BARELY OVER A

04:35:40.190 --> 04:35:42.459
DECADE WE NOW KNOW THAT.

04:35:42.525 --> 04:35:46.029
PANDEMICS AND RECESSION DON'T

04:35:46.096 --> 04:35:48.365
HAVE TIME ONE. BUT WE CONTINUE

04:35:48.431 --> 04:35:50.934
TO PUT TIME LIMITS ON PEOPLE

04:35:51.001 --> 04:35:52.969
FOR SNAP BENEFITS CAO WORK. FOR

04:35:53.036 --> 04:35:54.471
SHORT TERM BENEFITS AT THE

04:35:54.537 --> 04:35:59.009
CHURCH ACTORS PROVIDE SO WE

04:35:59.075 --> 04:36:00.176
CERTAINLY ARE MAJOR. FOR OUT

04:36:00.243 --> 04:36:02.412
TIME WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR

04:36:02.479 --> 04:36:04.147
IN TAKING A VERY IMPORTANT STEP

04:36:04.214 --> 04:36:06.449
OF SUSPENDING THE COWARDS FORTY

04:36:06.516 --> 04:36:07.784
EIGHT MONTH CLOCK. BUT WE

04:36:07.851 --> 04:36:09.319
REALLY THINK THAT AS WE MOVE%

04:36:09.386 --> 04:36:11.488
FORWARDWE NEED TO CAN WE NEED

04:36:11.554 --> 04:36:13.023
TO KEEP UP SUSPENSION IN PLACE

04:36:13.089 --> 04:36:14.524
UNTIL THE ECONOMY REALLY GETS

04:36:14.591 --> 04:36:16.359
BACK ON ITS FEET. AND WE REALLY

04:36:16.426 --> 04:36:17.894
HAVE TO EXTEND OUT THE TIME

IT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY

04:36:36.046 --> 04:36:37.347
CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THE

04:36:37.414 --> 04:36:38.682
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF INCOME THE

LITERALLY IMPACT HUNDREDS OF

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. AND THAT

04:36:49.893 --> 04:36:51.194
BRINGS ME TO AN ADDITIONAL

04:36:51.261 --> 04:36:53.496
POINT WHICH IS THAT. ONE OF THE

04:36:53.563 --> 04:36:54.731
OTHER ISSUES AND CAL WORKS THAT

04:36:54.798 --> 04:36:56.366
WE REALLY THINK WE NEED TO

ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE GONNA

04:37:04.841 --> 04:37:06.810
BE CRITICAL OVER THE NEXT FEW.

04:37:06.876 --> 04:37:08.078
THAT'S FAMILY AFTERTASTE

04:37:08.144 --> 04:37:10.046
BACKGROUNDS THEY HAVE TO THE

04:37:10.113 --> 04:37:11.982
CASE OF FICTIONAL ORDERS

04:37:12.048 --> 04:37:12.916

FRANKLY ON COUNTY. TO RESPOND
