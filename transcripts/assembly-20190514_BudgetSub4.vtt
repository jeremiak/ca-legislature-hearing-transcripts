THAT THE MONTHLY PAYMENT WOULD

THE REASON THAT THAT IT WOULD BE

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.254

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:18.555

AS WE AGREE WITH THE LA OWES

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:33.496
ANALYSIS.

IT'S NOT OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:55.685
WE NEED A WAIVER FROM THE

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:58.621
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THESE

00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:00.156

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.825
KATAKANA TAKES A LEGAL --

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:03.059
STANDARD THAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE

REALLY LOOKING FOR IS A

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:07.163
CLARIFICATION AND I THINK THERE

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.765

THIS IS BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DO

WANT TO ALSO FLAG AND BRING INTO

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:24.981
CONSIDERATION THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:26.716
CAREFUL AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:28.585

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:29.986
WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.454
WE HAVE A LOT OF OVER PAYMENTS

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:32.622
WERE REDO ADVENT WE HAVE ADVANCE

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.090

THEY OWE MONEY.

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.298

WITH THE WITH THE PROPOSAL FIRST --

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:09.892
RESEARCH ON PAST PROGRAM SIMILAR

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:11.360
TO OPPORTUNITIES OWNS OF FOUND

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:12.862
MIXED EVIDENCE ABOUT THEIR

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:13.396
WHETHER OR NOT THEY BRING

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.431
POSITIVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:16.799
THE RESIDENTS OF THE TARGETED

COMMUNITIES AND BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.402
WE THINK THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:20.269
OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:21.904

THE PROGRAM -- SECONDLY IF

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.046
CALIFORNIA WHERE DOES CREATE A

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:30.580
STATE OPPORTUNITIES DON'T

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:32.582
BENEFIT -- WE THINK AT THAT

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:33.216
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT A

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:34.817
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TAX

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:35.852
BENEFIT.

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.854
A WOULD GO NOT TO INVESTORS THAT

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.489
ARE -- BRINGING NEW INVESTMENT

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.590
SHIFTING IT FROM OTHER STATES

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:43.726
BUT INSTEAD OF PROVIDING BENEFIT --

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:44.460
TO INVESTORS WHO WOULD HAVE

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.962
INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA ANYWAY

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:49.298

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:50.366
FEDERAL PROGRAM.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.100
AND FINALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.268
THAT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS A

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:53.269
PROBABLY AREN'T THE BEST

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:55.238
MECHANISM FOR FUNDING AFFORDABLE

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:57.573
HOUSING -- WE THINK OF THAT THE

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.742
STATE'S HAS SEVERAL EXISTING

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.244
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.812
PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROBABLY

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.680
BETTER THAN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.782
FOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:07.950
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FOR

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.286
THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND NOT

FLEXIBILITY.

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:40.443
YEAH I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.545
TO DO IS IS DO SOMETHING THAT'S

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.747

SAME THING FOR CALIFORNIA C.

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.557

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:29.425
TO INVESTORS TOO MANY THAT WE

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:32.995

TO WANNA JUST BUILT ON THE

FROM FROM LA -- YOU SAID THAT

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:20.296
THE REASON TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

THIS TAX BREAK IS TO COME INTO

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:24.400
CONFORMITY WITH -- THE FEDERAL --

01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:25.768

WHICH IS -- A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT

AND WE HAVE A STATE.

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:39.815
COUNTERPART TO THAT -- AND

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:40.850
THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION FOR

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.885
YEARS ABOUT EXPANDING THAT TAX

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.286

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:20.289
WORK.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:21.757
VERSUS SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:24.059
TESTED THAT IS WORKING IN OUR

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:26.362

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.262
WOULD SEEK THE FIRST IS AN

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:49.932
EXPANSION BEYOND -- CLEAN TECH

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.834
AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING A TO

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.736
FULLER CONFORMITY AND ALSO ON

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.304
THE FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT CONTAIN

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.072
A NUMBER OF METRICS AND OTHER

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:59.108
PROVISIONS OF TRANSPARENCY WHICH

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:01.143
WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.211
ADOPT AS WELL.

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:02.778
WHILE WORKING WITH SENATOR

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:05.581
HERTZBERG ON HIS SB -- THREE

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:06.615
FIFTEEN THAT MIGHT GO ALONG

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:09.585
THOSE WAYS SO WITH THAT WE URGE --

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.453
YOUR ADOPTION OF THE FULLER

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:20.729
CONFORMITY PACKAGE THANK YOU YOU.

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:21.764
HI MISTER SHERMAN MEMBERS FOR

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:22.831
CHILLED WITH CALIFORNIA FOR THE

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.299
CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT WHAT

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:25.434
WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.402
CONVERSATION THAT YOU JUST HAD

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:30.572
WITH CALLUM SEE MORE IMPORTANTLY.

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:31.974
THAT THERE'S A SENSE THAT WE

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.575
HAVE ABOUT OUR SKEPTICISM ABOUT

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:34.943
THIS AND MUCH OF THAT.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.912
IS BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.147
ENTERPRISE ZONES AND I WOULD

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:41.016
SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THIS KIND OF

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.184
INVESTMENT.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.087
OF A POTENTIAL FOR UNDERSERVED

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.488
COMMUNITIES IS FUNDAMENTALLY

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:47.990
DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY IN WHICH

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:50.325
THE ENTERPRISE ZONE MODEL WORKED.

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.427
SO DON'T RELY ON OUR GOOD

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.729
FRIENDS AT THE LEGISLATIVE

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.330
ANALYST'S TO LOOKED AT THE

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:56.932
ENTERPRISE ZONES MANY OF US DID

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.167
AND SAID THAT THING DIDN'T WORK

01:13:58.233 --> 01:13:59.935
PROPERLY THIS ONE WORKS MUCH

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.003
DIFFERENTLY.

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.204
AND THE REASON THAT IT DOES IS

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:05.240
IT RELIES ON THE ABILITY OF A

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:07.709
PRIVATE INVESTOR. TO PUT MONEY

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.112
INTO A PROJECT THAT HAS A

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.713
COMMUNITY BENEFIT OR THE

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.916
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BASICALLY

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:14.817
UNDER FINANCED.

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:17.085
THAT CAN GO ALONG WITH MATCHING

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:17.920
STATE.

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:20.989
FUNDS PARTICULARLY FOR HOUSING

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:21.590
FOR THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:22.958
CREDIT.

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:25.027
BECAUSE INEVITABLY THE

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:27.262
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDER HAS A

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.398
CAPITAL STOCK THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:30.966
WORK AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:31.934
MONEY OUT OF THAT LOW INCOME

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.502
HOUSING TAX CREDIT BUT THEY MAY

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:36.305
NEED THAT LAST FIVE TEN FIFTEEN

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:36.705
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:39.508
THAT IS SITTING IN A CALIFORNIA

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.677
OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUND.

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:42.711
CURRENTLY THERE ABOUT TWO

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:43.979
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FUNDS NATION

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:45.714
WIDE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:47.282
HAVING THE NUMBER OF THE

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.785
CALIFORNIA ONES MR GENERAL MAY

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:50.285
KNOW.

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.321
HOME HOW MANY THERE ARE EIGHT

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:53.088
HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE I'M SORRY I

THIRTY NATIONWIDE MANY OF THEM

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.595
ARE FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.096
COMMUNITIES OR INDIVIDUAL STATES

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.397
SOME OF THEM ARE.

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:03.966
FOCUSED ON MULTI FAMILY HOUSING

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.935
SOME OF THEM ARE FOCUSED ON JOB

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:08.604
CREATION AND MANUFACTURING.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.006
AND SO PLEASE DO TWO THINGS WHAT

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:12.407
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT.

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:20.816
YOUR ACTION ABOUT HOW THE STATE

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:22.818
OUGHT -- TO PUT TOGETHER THIS

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:23.952
POTENTIAL FOR INVESTMENT IN

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:24.553
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. TWO

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.721
THINGS ONE OF THEM IS MAKE SURE

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:26.321
AS CHRIS POINTED OUT YOU NEED

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:26.989
SOME TRACKING MECHANISM YOU NEED

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:28.123
SOME STATE ORGANIZATION TO WATCH

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:28.690
AND SEE HOW THAT INVESTMENT

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.559
WORKED THE OTHER IS KEEP YOUR

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.327
MINDS OPEN TO A BROADER

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.528
CONFORMITY.

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.831
THEN A KIND OF PROJECT BY

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:38.133
PROJECT NARAL -- CONFORMING

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.835
TREATMENT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.436
THAT THE CITY OF STOCKTON WHICH

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.272
IS SO CALLED OPPORTUNITIES

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:44.506
ALREADY THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:47.676
OF WORK HAS ITS OWN REASONS. FOR

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.711
PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT WILL

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:51.513
OCCUR IN DOWNTOWN STOCKTON THE

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.515
CITY OF SAN JOSE HAS A DIFFERENT

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:54.449
SET.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.484
THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SO

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.986
THAT'S PRIMARILY AN AREA FOR

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.488
GROWING MANUFACTURING THAT'S

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:00.989
WHERE THEY WANTED VESTMENT SO

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:02.691
YOU NEED SOME AMOUNT OF

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.359
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION.

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:16.471
GETS CONFORMING TREATMENT BUT

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.373
RATHER THE COMMUNITY HAS SOME

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:18.774
INTEREST.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.276

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:50.906
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:52.007
LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF US SO WE

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:53.342
HAVE TO OPERATE NOT ON WHAT WE

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.777
ASSUME BUT WE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:57.279

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:04.553
POLICY CENTER WHICH IN FACT DOES

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:06.788
ANALYZE THE FEDERAL PROGRAM --

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.423
AND IDENTIFIES A FAIRLY

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.093
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FLAWS AND

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.961
EXPLICITLY STATES -- CONCERN

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.463
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE PROGRAM

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.998
IS REALLY DESIGNED TO BENEFIT

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:18.066
THE WEALTHY -- WITH POTENTIAL

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.801
HARM TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:21.203
SO WE WOULD WANT TO SEE A

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:23.205
PROPOSAL -- CERTAINLY THAT HAD

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.806
TRACKING MECHANISMS BUT THAT'S

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.641
NOT ENOUGH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:28.210
THAT WHEN WE'RE BUDGETING WHERE

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:31.813
PRIORITIZING -- AND YOU KNOW THE

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.948
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO WRITE FULLY

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.616
IDENTIFIED OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.451
WE DO NO WORK AND WHAT WE KNOW

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.819
ABOUT THE ENTERPRISE ZONES WAS

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.121
THAT IN SPITE OF THE BEST

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.489
INTENTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE.

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.257
IN SPITE OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.792
THAT COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.727
WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE --

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:47.562
OR WERE UP SORT OF THE HIGHEST

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:49.464
POTENTIAL TO ACCESS PROGRAMMING

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:51.099
THAT THOSE WERE FREQUENTLY GAMES --

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.267
AT THE EXPENSE OF LOW INCOME

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.202
COMMUNITIES AND TAXPAYERS ACROSS

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:55.337
THE STATE AND CERTAINLY WHILE

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:57.039
IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESPECT LOCAL

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:58.740
NEED I'M SURE THOSE ASSEMBLY

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:04.613
PROBLEM AND THAT PRIORITIES AT

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:11.053
OF OUR LOW INCOME TAXPAYERS --

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:12.621
AND SO AS A RESULT WE'RE VERY

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:13.922
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:15.190
THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:16.992

UNABLE TO AFFORD DIAPERS.

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:04.559
OR TAMPONS ARE ABLE TO DO SO AND

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:05.660
WE'RE NOT ALLOCATING FUNDING

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:06.995
DIRECTLY TO THAT WE'RE JUST

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:08.429
ENSURING THAT EVERYONE GETS A

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:09.831
LITTLE BIT OF A BENEFIT WHICH

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:10.865
MEANS AT THE SAME TIME THAT

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:13.368
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE.

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.103
WHETHER OR NOT THE ATC CAN BE

01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:16.170

KARDASHIAN'S BABY'S DIAPERS AND

BECAUSE IT WILL REQUIRE MARKET

PLACE FACILITATORS -- TO IT WILL

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.205

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:18.226
HELLO.

01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:19.827
HOW WE HAVE TWO COMMENTS ON THIS

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:22.063
PROPOSAL FIRST IT WOULD CREATE A

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.365
BENEFIT FOR SOME FULLY NON COME

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:26.567
FULLY NON COMPLIANT TAXPAYERS

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.302
THAT IS UNAVAILABLE TO OTHERWISE

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:30.271
SIMILAR PARTIALLY COMPLIANT

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:31.439
TAXPAYERS?

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:32.707
ON ONE HAND THAT DIFFERENCE

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:35.009
COULD RAISE SOME EQUITY CONCERNS

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.077
ON THE OTHER HAND.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.745
FULLY NON COMPLIANT TAXPAYERS

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.080
MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.349
WERE REQUIRED TO COLLECT USE TAX.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.950
IN OUR SECOND COMMENT IS THAT

01:28:43.017 --> 01:28:44.585
THE PROPOSED BENEFIT WOULD NOT

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:46.688
BE AVAILABLE TO RETAILERS TO

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:48.790
FILE OR RICH FILE RETURNS OR

01:28:48.856 --> 01:28:50.158
MAKE PAYMENTS.

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:52.427
PRIOR TO BEING CONTACTED BY CD

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.862
TFA ANY INCENTIVES CREATED BY

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:59.133
THAT PROVISION COULD BE COMPLEX.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.568
THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM THE

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:02.904

LIABILITY TO THE PAST THREE

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:22.390
YEARS IT IS OUR VIEW THAT THIS

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.459
TAX LIABILITY DOES NOT EXIST AT

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:28.062

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.731
THIS ITEM HAS A TIE INTO

SEVENTEEN NINETY LET ME EXPLAIN

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:35.436
JUST BRIEFLY.

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.972
WHEN A THIRD PARTY SELLERS SIGNS

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:41.342
UP ON -- FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:42.443
THEY CLICK THROUGH THE

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:46.647
APPLICATION AND THEY ENGAGE IN

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.216
SOME CONTRACT.

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:50.952
NOW -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:52.587
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN A THIRD

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:56.457
PARTY SELLER PROVIDES A PRODUCT

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:57.992
TO FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON.

01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.393
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.395
MATERIAL IS GOING TO BE STORED

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:04.165
AS WAS SAID PREVIOUSLY STATED.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.566
AND FURTHER MORE THEY WERE GIVEN

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.969
NO NOTICE THAT THEY HAD ANY

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:11.339
SALES TAX LIABILITY INSTEAD.

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:13.040

SO I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THEY

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.314
WERE NOT NOTIFIED THERE IS A

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:22.917
COMMON MAN MADE THAT CD TFA HAD

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:24.385
NOTIFIED FOLKS.

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:25.920
AND WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.588
WITH CD TFA AND WE HAVE FOUND

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:28.523

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:31.659
NOTICE WAS WANTING IN THAT FOLKS

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:32.827
WERE NOT AWARE THROUGH EACH --

MORE -- SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS AT

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:37.398
CETERA THAT THERE WAS EVEN THE

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:41.402
POTENTIAL FOR A SALES TAX

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:42.570
LIABILITY.

01:30:42.637 --> 01:30:44.071
AS TO THE LIABILITY OWED THE THE

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:46.073
TERM RETAILER IS USED AND WE

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:47.275
DON'T BELIEVE THESE FOLKS ARE

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:48.576
RETAILER.

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.011

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:55.049
THERE IS NO PRIVITY OF CONTRACT

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.651
THE CONTRACT IS BETWEEN THE

01:30:56.717 --> 01:30:58.119
THIRD PARTY SELLER AND

01:30:58.186 --> 01:31:00.655
FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON.

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:03.057
THEY CANNOT DICTATE THE RETURN

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:06.093
POLICY TO THE ULTIMATE PURCHASER

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.963
NOR CAN THEY HAVE ANY CONTACT

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.665
WITH THAT PURCHASER.

01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:12.400
IN FACT THEY ARE EXPLICITLY

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:15.369
PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO SO WE

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:16.971
SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THIS IS MORE

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:19.006
IT CAN TO IT I CAN SIGN ME

01:31:19.073 --> 01:31:20.208
AGREEMENT.

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:22.343
IN WHICH THE SELLER IN THIS CASE

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.078
FOR THE RETAILER REALLY IS

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:27.515
AMAZON AND WHERE BY THEY ARE THE

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.550

INTERFACE.

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:31.953
AND THEY'RE DETERMINING THE

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:35.356
RETURN POLICY AND OTHER THINGS.

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:36.991
TO MS WICKS BILL HER BILL

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.493
REQUIRES THAT THESE CONTRACTS BE

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.229

DID NOT OCCUR.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.835
SO THE EFFECT IS CORRECT THAT

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:51.639
THERE THIS IS DISCRIMINATORY 50%

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.774
OF THESE -- SO THIRD PARTY

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.843
SUPPLIERS ARE OUTSIDE THE

COUNTRY.

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:59.347
CV TFA WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO

I WILL SUBMIT TO YOU THAT MANY

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:08.022

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:14.495
ITEM WE THINK IS ILLUSORY AND

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:16.163
FINALLY.

01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:18.733
I WANT -- TO BRING TO THE

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.902

A TAILOR'S THAT THEY COULD

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.614

AND COLLECT THE SALES TAX IS

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:56.537
RIDICULOUS AND WE THINK THAT

THERE SHOULD BE NO TAX LIABILITY.

01:32:58.606 --> 01:32:59.674

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:53.363
THESE ARE SORT OF BROAD REACHING

02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:55.465
AND IF I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

02:37:55.532 --> 02:37:56.233
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU THE U. L.

02:37:56.300 --> 02:37:56.633
L..

02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:57.401
HOW INCREASING AT THE

02:37:57.467 --> 02:37:58.969
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE

02:37:59.036 --> 02:38:01.305
PREPARED -- SHORTHAND OUT -- IF

02:38:01.371 --> 02:38:02.072
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE UNFORTUNATELY

02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:03.540
I APOLOGIZE IS PASSED OUT A

02:38:03.607 --> 02:38:04.808
LITTLE BIT EARLIER SO IF YOU

02:38:04.875 --> 02:38:06.043
DON'T HAVE ONE I THINK THAT

02:38:06.109 --> 02:38:07.911
SURGEONS HAVE A FEW EXTRA COPIES.

02:38:07.978 --> 02:38:08.812
I'M.

02:38:08.879 --> 02:38:10.714
OKAY GREAT -- SO I'M GONNA SKIP

02:38:10.781 --> 02:38:12.282
OVER THE FIRST TWO PAGES BECAUSE

02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:13.684
I BELIEVE THOSE WERE -- VERY

02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:16.920
WELL COVERED BY -- BY FINANCE BY --

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:18.422
MISTER COLLINS SO IF YOU TURN TO

02:38:18.488 --> 02:38:20.824
PAGE -- THREE I JUST WANT TO

02:38:20.891 --> 02:38:21.992
HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S A TABLE

02:38:22.059 --> 02:38:23.894
THAT VISUALLY SHOWS -- WHAT

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:25.929
FINANCE EXPLAINS IN TERMS OF

02:38:25.996 --> 02:38:28.532
WHAT -- IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED

02:38:28.599 --> 02:38:30.400
TO EACH PROGRAM EACH ALLOCATION

02:38:30.467 --> 02:38:32.202
AND HOW MUCH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

02:38:32.269 --> 02:38:33.570
FOR EACH ALLOCATION.

02:38:33.637 --> 02:38:34.872
I'M JUST A COUPLE THINGS AS WELL

02:38:34.938 --> 02:38:41.879
TO HIGHLIGHT -- TO REINFORCE

02:38:41.945 --> 02:38:44.181
WHAT FINANCE MENTIONED -- BED

02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:45.082
ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

02:38:45.148 --> 02:38:46.049
ALLOCATION ONE IS THAT NOW

02:38:46.116 --> 02:38:47.184
THEY'RE PROPOSING SOME FUNDING --

02:38:47.251 --> 02:38:48.085
THROUGH THE FEAR OF CAMPUS

02:38:48.151 --> 02:38:49.419
CONTROL TO GO BAD AS A FOREIGN

02:38:49.486 --> 02:38:51.822
EQUITY PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY THAT

02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:52.422
WAS FUNDED OUT OF THE GENERAL

02:38:52.489 --> 02:38:54.491
FUND -- YOU'LL ALSO NOTE THAT

02:38:54.558 --> 02:38:55.759
THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR -- AS

02:38:55.826 --> 02:38:56.727
WITH SAID AS WAS STATED

02:38:56.793 --> 02:38:58.195
PROVOCATION THREE SO THIS IS AB

02:38:58.262 --> 02:38:59.930
AND IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE THIS

02:38:59.997 --> 02:39:00.564
IS REALLY THE FIRST TIME WE'VE

02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:01.298
HAD.

02:39:01.365 --> 02:39:03.133
FUNS THAT ARE GOING TO ALL OF

02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.002
THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES -- IF

02:39:05.068 --> 02:39:07.671
YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE BEGIN

02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:09.306
OUR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:39:09.373 --> 02:39:12.809
CONSIDERATION WE HIGHLIGHT A FEW

02:39:12.876 --> 02:39:13.277
FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:39:13.343 --> 02:39:13.644
CONSIDERATION.

02:39:13.710 --> 02:39:14.611
THE FIRST ISSUE WE WANTED TO

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:15.812
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THIS

02:39:15.879 --> 02:39:17.848
EXPENDITURE PLAN REALLY REFLECT

02:39:17.915 --> 02:39:20.517
THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES -- SO --

02:39:20.584 --> 02:39:22.219
PROP SIXTY FOUR PROVIDED

02:39:22.286 --> 02:39:24.187
ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT OF A BRAT

02:39:24.254 --> 02:39:26.023
IN TERMS OF THE FLEXIBILITY

02:39:26.089 --> 02:39:28.125
PROVIDED THE ADMINISTRATION --

02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:29.393
TO USE THESE FUNDS FOR A VARIETY

02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:31.428
OF ACTIVITIES AND SO REALLY THE

02:39:31.495 --> 02:39:32.663
EXPENDITURE PLAN REFLECTS THOSE

02:39:32.729 --> 02:39:34.898
PRIORITIES -- IT'S ALSO AS WAS

02:39:34.965 --> 02:39:36.333
MENTIONED BASED ON THOSE REVENUE

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:38.268
SO IT SAID SUBJECT TO CHANGE --

02:39:38.335 --> 02:39:39.469
THE SECOND POINT WE WANTED TO

02:39:39.536 --> 02:39:41.171
MAKE IS THAT IN GENERAL IT DOES

02:39:41.238 --> 02:39:42.639
THE EXPENDITURE PLAN DOES SEEM

02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:45.575
CONSISTENT WITH PROP -- SIXTY

02:39:45.642 --> 02:39:46.610
FOUR WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT IN A

02:39:46.677 --> 02:39:48.178
COUPLE PLACES THERE'S THERE'S A

02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:50.047
LITTLE BIT OF A LACK OF CLARITY

02:39:50.113 --> 02:39:51.782
IN PROP SIXTY FOUR AND SO THERE

02:39:51.848 --> 02:39:53.750
THERE COULD BE A A LESS

02:39:53.817 --> 02:39:55.819
CERTAINTY -- AND JUST WANTED TO

02:39:55.886 --> 02:39:56.853
HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THOSE ONE

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:58.989
IS THE USE OF THAT ALLOCATION

02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:00.624
ONE FOR EQUITY PROGRAMS -- ALSO

02:40:00.691 --> 02:40:03.226
THE USE OF ALLOCATION THREE FOR

02:40:03.293 --> 02:40:04.094
CHILDCARE SLOTS THE PENDING ON

02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:07.431
HOW THAT'S DONE -- COULD BE SOME

02:40:07.497 --> 02:40:08.799
LEGAL UNCERTAINTY THERE.

02:40:08.865 --> 02:40:09.433
THE THIRD ISSUE WE WANTED TO

02:40:09.499 --> 02:40:09.900
RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:40:09.967 --> 02:40:11.735
CONSIDERATION IS REALLY THE

02:40:11.802 --> 02:40:13.737
LEGISLATURE'S ROLE -- THERE'S

02:40:13.804 --> 02:40:15.672
SOME UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THAT --

02:40:15.739 --> 02:40:17.174
SO CLEARLY PROP SIXTY FOUR

02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:19.142
CONTINUOUSLY ALLOCATE THE FUNDS --

02:40:19.209 --> 02:40:20.911
SO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE

02:40:20.978 --> 02:40:22.346
TO TAKE ACTION TO APPROPRIATE

02:40:22.412 --> 02:40:24.047
FUNDS -- BUT THERE'S SOME

02:40:24.114 --> 02:40:26.016
UNCERTAINTY EXACT ON EXACTLY HOW

02:40:26.083 --> 02:40:27.751
MUCH THE LEGISLATURE CAN DIRECT

02:40:27.818 --> 02:40:30.187
THESE FUNDS -- SO THAT'S AN AREA

02:40:30.253 --> 02:40:31.555
WHERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF

02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:32.689
GRAY AREA.

02:40:32.756 --> 02:40:34.124
I NEXT WEEK WE DID WANT TO

02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:35.625
HIGHLIGHT THAT DESPITE THE

02:40:35.692 --> 02:40:36.827
UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THE

02:40:36.893 --> 02:40:38.195
LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN DIRECTING

02:40:38.261 --> 02:40:39.196
THE FUND SPECIFICALLY.

02:40:39.262 --> 02:40:40.464
WE THINK THAT CLEARLY THE

02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:42.099
LEGISLATURE PLAYS A VERY VERY

02:40:42.165 --> 02:40:43.233
IMPORTANT ROLE IN OVERSEEING

02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:46.003
THESE FUNDS -- AND THIS IS IN A

02:40:46.069 --> 02:40:47.037
VERY CONSISTENT THE

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:48.605
LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN GENERAL --

02:40:48.672 --> 02:40:49.639
BUT ESPECIALLY WITH THESE

02:40:49.706 --> 02:40:51.041
FRIENDS GET ESPECIALLY GIVEN SO

02:40:51.108 --> 02:40:53.176
MUCH FLEXIBILITY WE THINK IT'S A

02:40:53.243 --> 02:40:55.712
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE -- THEIR FEW

02:40:55.779 --> 02:40:56.880
QUESTIONS THAT WE SUGGEST THAT

02:40:56.947 --> 02:40:57.748
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

02:40:57.814 --> 02:40:59.216
CONSIDER AS A CONDUCTOR THIS

02:40:59.282 --> 02:41:01.385
OVERSIGHT ROLE -- THE FIRST IS

02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:02.853
WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:41:02.919 --> 02:41:04.654
PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION --

02:41:04.721 --> 02:41:07.157
TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE MAKE --

02:41:07.224 --> 02:41:08.925
UNDERSTAND HOW THESE FUNDS ARE

02:41:08.992 --> 02:41:10.727
BEING ALLOCATED IN USE I'M IN

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:12.195
SOME CASES THESE FUNDS ARE

02:41:12.262 --> 02:41:13.663
PROPOSED FOR NEW PROGRAMS IN

02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:14.664
OTHER CASES VERY.

02:41:14.731 --> 02:41:16.366
SIGNIFICANT EXPANSIONS TO

02:41:16.433 --> 02:41:18.101
EXISTING PROGRAMS SO THE

02:41:18.168 --> 02:41:18.702
LEGISLATURE'S GONNA WANT TO

02:41:18.769 --> 02:41:20.604
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE

02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:21.805
GOING ABOUT DOING THIS WHERE THE

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:23.240
FUNDS ARE TO BE ALLOCATED HOW

02:41:23.306 --> 02:41:24.608
THE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE RUN.

02:41:24.674 --> 02:41:26.143
ON THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO --

02:41:26.209 --> 02:41:27.344
WE THINK THOSE ARE VERY

02:41:27.411 --> 02:41:28.545
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

02:41:28.612 --> 02:41:30.013
I'M ALSO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:31.314
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:33.450
PROPOSING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

02:41:33.517 --> 02:41:34.551
EIGHTY NEW POSITIONS TO

02:41:34.618 --> 02:41:35.752
IMPLEMENT.

02:41:35.819 --> 02:41:36.319
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THESE

02:41:36.386 --> 02:41:38.088
FUNDS -- THERE WEREN'T ANY

02:41:38.155 --> 02:41:39.523
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS --

02:41:39.589 --> 02:41:40.891
PROVIDING DETAILS ON THESE

02:41:40.957 --> 02:41:42.359
POSITIONS THE LEGISLATURE'S JUST

02:41:42.426 --> 02:41:44.361
GONNA WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

02:41:44.428 --> 02:41:45.662
COMFORTABLE BUT IT'S RECEIVED

02:41:45.729 --> 02:41:47.330
ENOUGH INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND

02:41:47.397 --> 02:41:48.598
THE NEED FOR THESE POSITIONS

02:41:48.665 --> 02:41:50.267
WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING -- AND

02:41:50.333 --> 02:41:54.204
REALLY AND REALLY OVERSEE THOSE.

02:41:54.271 --> 02:41:54.805
IN CASES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

02:41:54.871 --> 02:41:55.338
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT HAS

02:41:55.405 --> 02:41:57.107
SUFFICIENT INFORMATION WE THINK

02:41:57.174 --> 02:41:58.241
IT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR

02:41:58.308 --> 02:41:58.708
THAT.

02:41:58.775 --> 02:42:00.377
LEGISLATURE TO ASK DEPARTMENTS

02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:01.978
TO COME FORWARD IN BUDGET

02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:04.381
HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE NOT TO

02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:05.949
PROVIDE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION.

02:42:06.016 --> 02:42:08.251
THE NEXT MAJOR AREA OF FORGET WE

02:42:08.318 --> 02:42:09.619
THINK THE LEGISLATURE REALLY CAN

02:42:09.686 --> 02:42:11.855
OVERSEE IS IS ON OUTCOMES.

02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:13.457
SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:42:13.523 --> 02:42:15.158
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER --

02:42:15.225 --> 02:42:17.127
ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT

02:42:17.194 --> 02:42:18.428
ITS OUTCOMES WHAT OUTCOMES

02:42:18.495 --> 02:42:20.730
EXPECTS TO TO ACHIEVE -- AND

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:21.898
WHAT ITS TARGETS ARE FOR THE USE

02:42:21.965 --> 02:42:23.967
OF THESE FUNDS THIS YEAR WE HAVE

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:24.968
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILLION

02:42:25.035 --> 02:42:26.136
DOLLARS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:42:26.203 --> 02:42:27.637
MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLOCATION.

02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:28.505
THREE IN FUTURE YEARS IT COULD

02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:29.873
BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN NOT

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:31.541
BECAUSE IT COULD GROW OVER TIME

02:42:31.608 --> 02:42:32.476
AND SO THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT

02:42:32.542 --> 02:42:34.778
OF MONEY -- WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

02:42:34.845 --> 02:42:36.713
WE'RE CHEATING THE OUTCOMES THAT --

02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:37.848
BIRD WE KNOW WHAT THE WHAT

02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:39.649
OUTCOMES WERE SHOOTING -- FOR

02:42:39.716 --> 02:42:40.684
AND THEREFORE CAN HOLD THE

02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:41.852
ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:42:41.918 --> 02:42:45.755
ACHIEVING THEM -- SO AGAIN -- IN

02:42:45.822 --> 02:42:46.823
CASES WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION

02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:48.391
HASN'T ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED

02:42:48.458 --> 02:42:49.759
OUTCOME THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:42:49.826 --> 02:42:52.295
ADOPT REPORTING LANGUAGE TO

02:42:52.362 --> 02:42:53.763
REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TO

02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:55.265
PROVIDE THOSE OUTCOME MEASURES

02:42:55.332 --> 02:42:57.033
OR IT COULD PROVIDE SOME

02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:59.402
LEGISLATIVE INTENSE -- AND THEN

02:42:59.469 --> 02:43:01.104
FINALLY WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

02:43:01.171 --> 02:43:02.172
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK THE

02:43:02.239 --> 02:43:03.773
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW THOSE

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:05.575
OUTCOMES THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

02:43:05.642 --> 02:43:06.877
THOSE OUTCOMES IT'S GOING TO BE

02:43:06.943 --> 02:43:09.146
MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS --

02:43:09.212 --> 02:43:10.780
AND THAT COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE

02:43:10.847 --> 02:43:12.682
SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE I THAT

02:43:12.749 --> 02:43:13.884
WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SOME

02:43:13.950 --> 02:43:15.519
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHERE

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:17.821
MONIES SPENT -- WHAT OUTCOMES

02:43:17.888 --> 02:43:20.190
ARE ACHIEVED I'D SAY THAT THE

02:43:20.257 --> 02:43:21.725
LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO HAVE SOME

02:43:21.791 --> 02:43:25.228
OVERSIGHT OVER THESE FUNDS ON AN

02:43:25.295 --> 02:43:26.963
ONGOING BASIS?

02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:27.597
THANK YOU THAT'S A QUESTION FOR

02:43:27.664 --> 02:43:28.765
FINANCE -- THE 60% THE ONE

02:43:28.832 --> 02:43:29.699
HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS

02:43:29.766 --> 02:43:31.268
TROUBLE IS TO DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

02:43:31.334 --> 02:43:33.503
HEALTH FOR CANNABIS SURVEILLANCE

02:43:33.570 --> 02:43:37.140
WHAT IS CAN THE SURVEILLANCE --

02:43:37.207 --> 02:43:38.441
WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A

02:43:38.508 --> 02:43:39.876
RESPONSE FOR STAFF TO BE A

02:43:39.943 --> 02:43:41.111
LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH BUT

02:43:41.178 --> 02:43:42.779
GENERALLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:43:42.846 --> 02:43:45.849
THAT PUBLIC HEALTH -- SORT OF I

02:43:50.086 --> 02:43:52.255
THEY LOOK AT SORT OF METRICS IN

02:43:52.322 --> 02:43:53.723

LEAST JUST TO SEE SACRAMENTO

02:46:19.602 --> 02:46:21.371
THAT LEGALIZED IT YOU'VE GOT I

02:46:21.438 --> 02:46:24.140
THINK SIX OTHER.

02:46:24.207 --> 02:46:24.741
LOCAL CITIES IN JURISDICTIONS

02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:25.508
THAT [inaudible]

02:46:25.575 --> 02:46:28.144
BENNETT SO.

02:46:28.211 --> 02:46:29.879
HOW HOW DO WE -- AND I'M WHEN I

02:46:29.946 --> 02:46:31.147
LOOK.

02:46:31.214 --> 02:46:32.015
NUMBER ONE WAS NUMBER SEASON

02:46:32.082 --> 02:46:33.616
CALIFORNIA ALLOW CANNABIS CELLS

02:46:33.683 --> 02:46:36.319
ARE CULTIVATION -- THE THE

02:46:36.386 --> 02:46:37.654
LATEST NUMBER I THINK THAT'S

02:46:37.721 --> 02:46:39.389
ALWAYS CHANGING SO IT'S A MOVING

02:46:39.456 --> 02:46:41.725
TARGET BUT I THINK I THE NUMBER

02:46:41.791 --> 02:46:43.760
OF BANDS CITIES IS AROUND THREE

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:45.729
HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND I BELIEVE

02:46:45.795 --> 02:46:47.263
THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO

02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:50.200
CITY STATEWIDE SO.

02:46:50.266 --> 02:46:51.701
SO I GUESS AND AND I'M I WORKED

02:46:51.768 --> 02:46:53.837
WITH THE CANNABIS FOLKS SO WE'RE

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:55.372
NOT AT ODDS BUT THAT'S A BIG

02:46:55.438 --> 02:46:57.374
CHUNK OF MONEY.

02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.209
JUST GOING TO CITIES.

02:46:59.275 --> 02:47:00.977
THAT ALLOW.

02:47:01.044 --> 02:47:03.713
CANNABIS SALES AND DISTRIBUTION.

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:05.682
THAT'S 7% OF THAT PLOT SO SO

02:47:05.749 --> 02:47:07.050
THAT THAT.

02:47:07.117 --> 02:47:08.284
THAT REQUIREMENT WAS ACTUALLY

02:47:08.351 --> 02:47:10.687
SPECIFIED IN PROPOSITION SIXTY

02:47:10.754 --> 02:47:12.322
FOUR THAT I HAD TO GO TO

02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:13.823
JURISDICTIONS CORRECT THAT HAVE

02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:14.924
A GRAND IT SO WE'RE JUST HEARING

02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:16.393
TELL THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES

02:47:16.459 --> 02:47:17.961
HAVE A LOT OF LEEWAY I BELIEVE I

02:47:18.027 --> 02:47:18.995
I AGREE WITH.

02:47:19.062 --> 02:47:21.931
THE LA -- WE DO HAVE -- SOME ON

02:47:21.998 --> 02:47:23.099
THAT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG ISSUE

02:47:23.166 --> 02:47:25.034
AND AND ONE THING ABOUT THE THE

02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:25.902
INDUSTRY AND SOME FOLKS ARE FROM

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:27.971
INDUSTRY.

02:47:28.037 --> 02:47:29.539
YOU CAN SIGN ON THIS ISSUE.

02:47:29.606 --> 02:47:30.440
AND AT THE END OF THIS THE ISSUE

02:47:30.507 --> 02:47:33.209
OF ILLEGAL MARKET EMAIL AND LA I

02:47:33.276 --> 02:47:34.778
GUESS THERE.

02:47:34.844 --> 02:47:36.846
AT FOR THE AIRPORT.

02:47:36.913 --> 02:47:38.548
ILLEGAL INTERNATIONAL.

02:47:38.615 --> 02:47:42.118
THEIR SIEGES UP UNDER 66610066%

02:47:42.185 --> 02:47:44.053
FOR CANADA SMUGGLING.

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.054
SO THE BLACK MARKET THE BIG

02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:46.623
ISSUE I SEE MONEY GOING TO

02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:48.391
FISHING GAME AND EVERYBODY BUT

02:47:48.458 --> 02:47:49.959
WE'RE STILL NOT TALKING THE

02:47:50.026 --> 02:47:51.361
BLACK MARKET ISSUE.

02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:52.896
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS FOR

02:47:52.962 --> 02:47:54.798
THAT RESTORATION AND DAMAGE BUT

02:47:54.864 --> 02:47:56.499
WE KNOW THAT IN SACRAMENTO AND A

02:47:56.566 --> 02:47:58.535
LOT OF AREAS -- MUSCLES HOUSES

02:47:58.601 --> 02:48:00.737
ARE INDOOR ROSE THAT ARE OUT

02:48:00.804 --> 02:48:02.605

FULL FROM BACK EAST -- USING --

IMMIGRANTS. FOR LABOR.

02:48:08.878 --> 02:48:11.147
SO AT SOME POINT THE INDUSTRY

02:48:11.214 --> 02:48:12.782
WHO ARE HERE.

02:48:12.849 --> 02:48:14.184
HAS TO COME OUT AND TAKE A STAND

02:48:14.250 --> 02:48:15.952
IF YOU YOU'RE AGAINST A BLACK

ARE YOU PART OF PALMER PA THE

02:48:29.499 --> 02:48:30.900
SOLUTION.

02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:31.768
YOU'RE STILL NOT THE BLACK

02:48:31.835 --> 02:48:33.303

YOU KNOW AND IT IS THIS IS

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:51.588
VERONICA.

BECAUSE SOME POINT IT'S NOT

02:48:58.328 --> 02:48:59.829
GOING TO MEET TO COME BACK AND

02:48:59.896 --> 02:49:01.264
WATCHING THE BUT ON THIS.

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:02.265
HELLO PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

02:49:02.332 --> 02:49:03.533
ON THIS BUT YET YOU KNOW THEY

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.034
DON'T WANT.

02:49:05.101 --> 02:49:09.005
TO YOU KNOW MAKE IT RIGHT SO --

02:49:09.072 --> 02:49:10.740
THIS LACKEY YEAH I'VE.

02:49:10.807 --> 02:49:12.141
FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY FIRST

02:49:12.208 --> 02:49:15.845
OF ALL I I FINAL CATION THREE TO

02:49:15.912 --> 02:49:17.714
BE A LITTLE BIT -- QUESTIONABLE

02:49:17.780 --> 02:49:18.014
[inaudible]

02:49:18.081 --> 02:49:22.485
WHEN -- SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE.

02:49:22.552 --> 02:49:25.588
WE'RE TREATING TO DAYCARE.

02:49:25.655 --> 02:49:27.290
I MEAN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

02:49:27.357 --> 02:49:28.791
THE NEXUS IS DISCOURAGING

02:49:28.858 --> 02:49:30.793
POTENTIAL USE OF CANNABIS I

02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:32.795
THINK THAT'S QUITE CREATIVE.

02:49:32.862 --> 02:49:34.464
WAS IT A LOT THIS QUESTION THOSE

02:49:34.531 --> 02:49:35.431
THAT WRITTEN IN THE PROCESS

02:49:35.498 --> 02:49:36.099
BEFORE LANGUAGE IS THAT

02:49:36.165 --> 02:49:37.667
SOMETHING POLITICIANS PUT IN

02:49:37.734 --> 02:49:39.736
THERE.

02:49:39.802 --> 02:49:42.038
NO IT WAS NOT SO YEAH.

02:49:42.105 --> 02:49:43.940
AND THAT IS 60% CAN GO TO

02:49:44.007 --> 02:49:45.708
PROGRAMS THAT EMPHASIZE

02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:47.911
EDUCATION AND PENSION EARLY

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:49.712
INTERVENTION SCHOOL RETENTION IN

02:49:49.779 --> 02:49:51.447
TIMELY TREATS ARE TREATMENT

02:49:51.514 --> 02:49:52.782
SERVICES FOR YOUTH.

02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:55.518
THEIR FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS --

02:49:55.585 --> 02:49:57.453
WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT THAT --

02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.856
CHILD CARE INVESTMENT -- HITS

02:49:59.923 --> 02:50:01.491
THE EARLY INTERVENTION IN SCHOOL

02:50:01.558 --> 02:50:03.793
RETENTION MARKS -- AND WE DO

02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:05.161
THINK IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY NEED

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:06.796
SO WE THINK IT FITS WITHIN THE

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:08.264
INTENT INDEFINITELY IS AN AREA

02:50:08.331 --> 02:50:09.599
BUT LITTLE TALK HERE WE'RE NOT

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:10.934
WORRIED ABOUT THEM.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.402
CONSUMING CANNABIS SO.

02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:14.671
THEY'RE NOT GET CONSENT IN THE

02:50:14.737 --> 02:50:15.271
CANNABIS CONSUMERS LIKE THINK

02:50:15.338 --> 02:50:17.240
IT'S AN INCREASE IN CHILDCARE I

02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:18.274
THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE.

02:50:18.341 --> 02:50:20.276
DISCUSSED IN THE EDUCATION

02:50:20.343 --> 02:50:20.910
COMMITTEE AND THEY'RE PROBABLY

02:50:20.977 --> 02:50:23.046
MORE BETTER POSITION TO SPEAK TO

02:50:23.112 --> 02:50:24.614
THE ELEMENTS OF THOSE

02:50:24.681 --> 02:50:29.118
CONNECTIONS BUT I I DO THINK

02:50:29.185 --> 02:50:29.719
THAT -- WE BELIEVE THERE'S AN

02:50:29.786 --> 02:50:31.220
AXIS.

02:50:31.287 --> 02:50:31.888
I DON'T ALTER ANYWAYS I I'D LIKE

02:50:31.955 --> 02:50:32.522
TO CONTINUE ALONG THE LINE OF

02:50:32.589 --> 02:50:33.790
THE BIGGEST THREAT. TO THIS

02:50:33.856 --> 02:50:35.858
INDUSTRY AND TO THE PUBLIC AT

02:50:35.925 --> 02:50:37.393
LARGE CLEARLY IS.

02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:40.096
WHAT -- THE CHAIR INDICATED AND

02:50:40.163 --> 02:50:41.764
THAT IS THE LIST OF MARKET.

02:50:41.831 --> 02:50:44.667
AND I SEE ROUTE I AM THANKFUL

02:50:44.734 --> 02:50:46.069
FOR THEM THE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:47.236
ALLOTMENT [inaudible]

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:49.672
THAT'S ATTRIBUTED HERE TOWARDS

02:50:49.739 --> 02:50:51.908
IMPAIRMENT -- BECAUSE THAT IS

02:50:51.975 --> 02:50:53.409
VERY CREDIBLE BECAUSE THAT IS A

02:50:53.476 --> 02:50:55.011
LIFE AND DEATH CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:50:55.078 --> 02:50:56.779
HOWEVER THE LIFE OF THIS

02:50:56.846 --> 02:50:58.348
INDUSTRY.

02:50:58.414 --> 02:51:00.984
IS BASICALLY AT STAKE BECAUSE OF

02:51:01.050 --> 02:51:02.285
A LACK OF ENGAGEMENT AGAINST THE

02:51:02.352 --> 02:51:03.586
ILLICIT MARKET.

02:51:03.653 --> 02:51:06.189
AND I DON'T BLAME JUST THE THE

02:51:06.255 --> 02:51:07.757
INDUSTRY FOR THAT.

02:51:07.824 --> 02:51:08.891
THAT CHALLENGE I THINK THAT

02:51:08.958 --> 02:51:09.892
THAT'S PART OF THE

02:51:09.959 --> 02:51:11.294
RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT.

02:51:11.361 --> 02:51:13.496
AND I THINK WE HAVE.

02:51:13.563 --> 02:51:15.765
THIS REALLY -- CONFUSING

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:17.767
CIRCUMSTANCE BETWEEN WHOSE

02:51:17.834 --> 02:51:19.469
RESPONSIBILITY IT IS IT IS IT TO

02:51:19.535 --> 02:51:21.337
TAKE ON THE ILLICIT MARKET

02:51:21.404 --> 02:51:23.106
WHETHER IT'S LOCALS OR WHETHER

02:51:23.172 --> 02:51:24.540
IT'S THE STATE AND ITS WE'VE GOT

02:51:24.607 --> 02:51:25.642
THE PROVERBIAL.

02:51:25.708 --> 02:51:27.543
FINGER POINTING GOING TOWARDS

02:51:27.610 --> 02:51:28.811
EACH OTHER AND NO ONE IS DOING A

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:30.513
DARN THING.

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:31.080
AND IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE A

02:51:31.147 --> 02:51:32.715
LITTLE BIT OF SOME OF THIS

02:51:32.782 --> 02:51:35.084
FUNDING. TO ADDRESS THAT

02:51:35.151 --> 02:51:36.753
PARTICULAR PROBLEM AGAINST

02:51:36.819 --> 02:51:39.122
ILLICIT MARKET I DON'T SEE VERY

02:51:39.188 --> 02:51:41.157
MUCH OF THAT. FOR THAT PURPOSE

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:42.291
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A

02:51:42.358 --> 02:51:43.826
DISSERVICE.

02:51:43.893 --> 02:51:46.029
AND I THINK IT'S MISDIRECTED.

02:51:46.095 --> 02:51:47.130
I I THINK.

02:51:47.196 --> 02:51:49.298
IT'S CLEARLY THE BIGGEST THREAT

02:51:49.365 --> 02:51:51.968
TO THE TO THE SURVIVAL OF THIS --

02:51:52.035 --> 02:51:54.103
REGULATED MARKET -- BECAUSE THE

02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:56.506
ILLICIT MARKET HAS HAD A LOT OF

02:51:56.572 --> 02:51:58.274
TIME TO BECOME VERY GOOD.

02:51:58.341 --> 02:52:00.076
AT DELIVERING THIS PRODUCT

02:52:00.143 --> 02:52:01.711
TWENTY YEARS TO BE EXACT PLUS

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:03.680
YEARS AND NO OTHER STATE HAS HAD

02:52:03.746 --> 02:52:04.947
THIS CONDITION.

02:52:05.014 --> 02:52:07.183
AND SO WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE

02:52:07.250 --> 02:52:08.785
LARGEST POPULATION BUT WE HAVE A

02:52:08.851 --> 02:52:11.454
VERY SKILLED DELIVERY NETWORK

02:52:11.521 --> 02:52:12.655
THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKING ON

02:52:12.722 --> 02:52:14.057
SERIOUSLY.

02:52:14.123 --> 02:52:15.725
AND I FIND THAT TO BE.

02:52:15.792 --> 02:52:18.161
VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING.

02:52:18.227 --> 02:52:19.962
AND I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE

02:52:20.029 --> 02:52:21.264
POTENT THAN.

02:52:21.330 --> 02:52:22.298
THIS WHERE THEY BECAUSE OF DAY

02:52:22.365 --> 02:52:24.167
CARE AND I REALLY REALLY HOPE

02:52:24.233 --> 02:52:25.702
THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY.

02:52:25.768 --> 02:52:26.936
TO GET SOME OF THE FUNDS TO GET

02:52:27.003 --> 02:52:28.037
THE COORDINATED EFFORT TO GO

02:52:28.104 --> 02:52:29.405
AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET BECAUSE

02:52:29.472 --> 02:52:31.240
THAT IS THE THREAT AS FAR AS THE
