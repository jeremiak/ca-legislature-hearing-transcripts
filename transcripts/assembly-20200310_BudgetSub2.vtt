TREND CAPACITY IS TRULY A STATE

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.585
WIDE TO AN ERROR COMMUNITY CAN

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:57.288
AND DO MORE TO ADDRESS IT AT

00:35:57.355 --> 00:36:00.758
COMPOUNDING THIS CAPACITY TAP

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:04.529
HIS ARE CHANGING BONHOMIE AS

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:08.733
PAT APPS TWENTIETH. YOU SING TO

FOR WORK POLITICS AND- NUMBER

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.870
THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY THIS

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.139
TODAY THE SHORTFALL OF NEARLY

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.308

A LOT MORE MUCH MORE NEEDS TO

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:31.022
BE DONE. SO RECOMMEND THREE

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:33.024
CONCRETE STEPS TO ADDRESS

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.326
CAPACITY AND DEMAND FOR DEGREES

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:37.495
THAT INVOLVE INNOVATION ACROSS

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:40.398
SECTORS AND SEGMENTS FIRST TO

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.667
ACCOMMODATE DEMAND WE NEED TO

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:46.103

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:56.480
STUDENTS WE APPLAUD THE STATE

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.616
TO LEADERSHIP ON MANY OF THESE

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:01.552
REFORMS WILL ENROLLMENT CLEAR.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.354
WAYS LIMóN EDUCATION FORM AND

MORE STUDENTS ARE BENEFITING UP

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:10.928
FUTURE EFFORT SHOULD BE

CAPACITY. AT SECOND TO EXPAND

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:29.614
OUR SUPPLY WE NEED TO CHANGE

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.450
THE WAY WE USE SPACE AND

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:34.652
RESOURCES WE SHOULD LEVERAGE

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:37.054
PHYSICAL SPACE MORE CREATIVELY

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.656
SHARING ALL THESE AND OTHER

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:42.927

COLLABORATIVELY TO A EYES.

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.227
THIRD AND FINALLY WE NEED TO

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:17.828
FOCUS ON REGIONS WITH THE

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:18.996
GREATEST NEEDS AND REGIONAL

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:20.131
PARTNERSHIPS SHOULD BE KEY

00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:23.100
PLAYERS IN THAT WORK CALIFORNIA

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:24.201
IS HOME TO SEVERAL REGION

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:28.005
OPERATIVES THAT WERE PROCESSED

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:30.875
AND EDUCATION SEGMENT DRESSED.

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:31.442

CAN OFTEN MOVE MORE QUICKLY

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:38.916
THAN THE STATE TO IDENTIFY NEED

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:41.819
SECURE LOCAL SUPPORT. AND

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:45.022

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:57.501
EDUCATION CITY TO MEET THOSE

00:38:57.568 --> 00:39:00.371

OF THAT KIND OF DATA YEAH IT'S

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:36.167
HARD TO PINPOINT EXACTLY WHAT

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.335
THAT LOW BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:39.804

AND LEAVING I PERSONALLY. AND

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:49.346
TO WHICH THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.915

TWO POINT FIVE FOR MEDICAL

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:34.483
STUDENTS ARE FIVE. THE FUNDING

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.086
FLOWS OUT THE BASED ON THE

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:39.121
TOTALNUMBER OF ENROLLMENT ON

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.957
EACH CAMPUS. A RESIDENT

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:45.628
ENROLLMENT ON EACH CAMPUS. BUT

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.696
WHEN WE LOOK AT- THE GROWTH

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.698
THAT WE'VE HAD OVER TIME SOME

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:50.900
OF THE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE GROWN

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.067
SIGNIFICANTLY ARE THE BURKE

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:56.906
CAMP SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES THE

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:57.473
CAMPUSES ARE IN HIGH DEMAND

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:01.577
WE'VE SEEN A SIG GROWTH IN CAL

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.547
YOU READ STUDENT I'M I'M- I'M

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:07.783
NOT A VERY TRYING. IT UP

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:10.186
QUICKLY CAN YOU INFORMATION

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.821
THAT. YEAH AND THAT WOULD BE

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.856
GOOD I'D LIKE DEFINITE THINK

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.357
THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:18.360
INTERESTED IN THAT. BUT WHAT I

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:19.829
HEARD THERE IS IT SEEMS LIKE A

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.130
LITTLE BIT. SOUND LIKE YOU'RE

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.032
OF DOING IT BASED ON WHERE YOU

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:24.900
HAVE RESIDENTS RIGHT NOW AND I

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.436
THINK. OUR CONCERN IS THAT

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.371
THERE'S MANY CAMPUSES THAT.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:30.773
DON'T HAVE AS MANY RESIDENT

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.675
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO SHOULD

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:34.944
THEY BE MAYBE GETTING. THE MORE

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.679
MONEY TOWARDS INCREASING THE

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:37.613
AMOUNT OF THE ROMAN GROSS

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.916
THEY'RE BAD FOR RESIDENTS IN

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.885
PARTICULAR. DOES THAT MAKE

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.720
SENSE EARLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.988
MAYBE THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S BEING

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.357
ALLOCATED THE FUNDS ARE ARE

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.759
ALLOCATED BASED ON ENROLLMENT

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.094
ON THE CAMPUSES IN THE NEW NEW

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:53.229
ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT ACTUALLY

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:56.632
TAKE ON. OF AND THERE ARE SOME

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:57.766
CAMPUSES THAT ARE ABLE TO TAKE

01:08:57.833 --> 01:09:02.004
ON FAR LESS OF SO EACH YEAR THE

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:05.474
CAMPUSES EVALUATE MANY. BUT YOU

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.109
KNEW. I THINK AND ACCOMMODATE

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.310
BASED ON THE HIRING THAT HAS

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.179
TAKEN PLACE AND THE FUNDING

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.480
THEY THINK THEY WILL HAVE FROM

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:13.382
ALL SOURCES. AND BASED ON THAT

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:17.219
THEY COME UP WITH OF A TARGET

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:20.389
OF WORK WITH YOU CO PIECE THAT

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:22.258
UP WITH THE TARGET AND ROLLED.

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:25.694
UP IF YOU HIT THAT GET THEM.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:28.597
THE FUNDING. THEY THEY RISK.

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.833
DON REVENUE STUDENTS THAT THEY

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.901
IN RAW BUT THERE TO GO THAT

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:35.070
TARA OKAY WHO'S HERE THERE TARA.

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:36.972
RIGHT AND WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:39.141
A MORE THAT FUNDING. OF YOU SAY

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.944
THAT. A LOT MORE THE RECENT

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.380
GROWTH HAS BEEN UP THERE'S BEEN

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:48.117
A LOT OF GROWTH IN SAN DIEGO

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:49.251
FOR OUR SIDE. OF THEIR GET THE

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:52.454
GOTTEN SOME MORE OF THE FUNDING

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:53.589
MORE. BUT WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.724
ON STUDENTS STUFF WE'VE TAKEN

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:58.360
ON IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WHERE

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.629
THE STATE HAS PROVIDED US WITH

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.865
GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF NEW FUNDING

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.533
FOR. STUDENTS BUT ACTUALLY OVER

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.101
AND ROLLED BEYOND THAT. AND SO

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.137
OUR CAMPUSES HAVEN'T BEEN

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.272
GETTING ALL THE FUNDING FOR

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:11.106
STUDENT THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:14.810
NEED. SO WHERE WE OVER EMERALD.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.946
OF AS A SYSTEM WHERE OVER AND

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:19.481
ROLLED BY ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:22.785
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- AND- WHAT

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:25.120
CAMPUSES WELL WE DISTRIBUTE THE

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:28.524
NEW FUNDING BASE WE REDUCE THE

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:32.895
pTHROUGH BUT AT THE CAMPUS SAYS

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.563
BECAUSE IT'S A FORMULA THAT

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:35.898
DIVIDES AL THE DOLLARS ACROSS

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.900
THE NEW STUDENT. SO IT'S JUST

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.535
THAT ALL CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:40.970
RECEIVING A LITTLE BIT LESS

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:42.705
THAN WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:45.441
GET. OKAY BUT IF FOR. STUDENTS

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.576
WHO MAY BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:50.613
CAMPUSES SIR. I GUESS WE ARE

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:52.448
DOING A BETTER JOB OF ENROLLING

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.450
P. AND IF THERE IF THERE ARE

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.952
OVER AND ROLLED. THERE'S

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.554
CAMPUSES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:01.523
MORE OVER AND ALL I GUESS WE

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.158
WOULD WANT TO KNOW THAT TO. ALL

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.294
RIGHT YEAH I CAN GET TO THE

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:06.762

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:09.331
CAMPUS TO SEE WHERE WHERE

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.833
THERE'S BEEN BOTH OVER IN ROME

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.635
IT WHERE YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:13.502
NOT GETTING FUNDED FOR THAT AND

AGENDA I THINK THIS IS THE MOST

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:45.934
ELIMINATING IS THAT IF YOU LOOK.

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:47.736
IF YOU LOOK AT. THE NUMBER OF

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:50.105
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WE'VE

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:52.741
INCREASED BY 10% IN THE LAST

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:54.610
DECADE ROUGHLY AND FOR NON

SAYS CALIFORNIANS. FOR TWENTY

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:18.967
FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE SINCE

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.235
THE LAST I THINK SIX YEARS ON

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:21.704
AVERAGE AND YOU SEE GROW BY A

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:24.406
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT SO

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:25.040
THANK YOU TO THE USE BEAR STILL

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:27.142
NOT. MEETING THE NEEDS.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.243
CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:30.212
GRADUATES BUT MIGHT MIGHT TWO

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:32.648
QUESTIONS ARE- ONE I WANT TO

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:34.016
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE POSITIVE

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.218
NEWS THAT. THAT UC. BERKELEY

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:39.521
AND DAVIS AND I RECENTLY MET

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.589
WITH UCLA TALKING ABOUT THIS IS.

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:43.292
AS FAR AS- PASSAGE HE ON THEIR

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.494
CAMPUSES THERE'S NOT ALWAYS THE

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.029
OPPORTUNITY TO GROW RIGHT THERE

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:49.832
BUT THERE ARE OFF CAMPUS ALL

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:52.134
THESE I KNOW AT UC BERKELEY

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.769
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.839
OVER MIL. PRIVATE SCHOOL-

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:57.940
FORMALLY AT ALL WOMEN'S

01:12:58.006 --> 01:13:00.442
COLLEGES HAVING. SOME STRUGGLES

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:01.777
WITH ENROLLMENT AND

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.545
SUSTAINABILITY AND SO BERKELEY

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:06.548
MAKE TAKE OVER THAT CAMPUS WITH

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.016
THINGS A FABULOUS IDEA I KNOW

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:10.219
THEY HAVE SOME. OF THE LAND OF.

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:11.820
A I THINK ON MY- OLD I KNOW

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:15.224
HERE AT UC DAVIS. WE HAVE THIS

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:17.226
AGGIE SQUARE CAMPUS AT OUR MED

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.894
CENTER HERE IN. IN THE

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:21.497
OUTSKIRTS OF SACRAMENTO. WE ARE

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:22.531
HAVE THE MED SCHOOL NURSING

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:23.132
SCHOOL THERE POTENTIALLY BRING

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.299
OUT PROGRAMS THERE AND I KNOW

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:27.469
THAT THE UCLA CHANCER WE MET ON

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.804
FRIDAY TALKING ABOUT HIS IDEAS

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.005
FOR THE I JUST THINK THAT'S-

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.874
WHAT WE BELIEVE THE- KING OUT

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.108
IN SOME. THIS CAN I THINK WE

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.511
WOULD. PRE WAR AND FOCUS ON HOW

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:36.779
WE INVEST IN THAT WE GET A

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.080
COUPLE YEARS AGO. AGGIE SQUARE

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:39.615
BUT I THINK THAT POTENTIAL IS

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:42.918
THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE NEED TO

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:45.354
EXPAND. AND I KNOW THE GET

01:13:45.420 --> 01:14:01.503
SANTA

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:10.112
THINKING WITH THESE OFF CAMPUS

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.280
CENTERS RATHER PLACE TO ENROLL

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:12.848

WORK START TO GET SOME

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:20.856
ENROLLMENT PLAN. THINGS LOOK

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:23.225
LIKE OVER THE YEARS IN ADDITION

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.460
THAT- THEY ARE LOOKING AT OTHER

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.129
STRATEGIES TO PARTNER WITH A

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:30.432
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND- PRIVATE

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:31.867

MOST- IT COMPETITIVE CAMPUSES

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:50.992
IS COURSE THE ISSUE OF THE

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:53.061
ADVANCE VERSUS NON RESIDENTS.

01:23:53.128 --> 01:24:01.669

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:06.687
DON'T WANT IT TO BE LOTS EIGHT

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:16.764

WE WANT MORE STUDENTS I MEAN I

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:21.002
WISH AT YOU WE WOULD SEE THE

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:23.170
IMPACT IMPACTS AND THAT YOU SEE

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:25.006
MORE SAID BUT WE DON'T THE

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.607
TRUTH IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.175
STUDENTS AND PARENTS AND

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:30.444
TAXPAYERS TALKING TWO. OF ALL

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:34.448
THE CAMPUS. WHICH IS A THINK IT.

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:36.417
THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE THE IS IT

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.287
HAPPENED SEE FOR ELEVEN YEARS I

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:40.454
DON'T THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GO

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:43.024
TO UCLA OR BERKLEY I THERE ARE

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.826
BETTER MEET TO DO THAT

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.929
UNIVERSITIES AND I DO MY BY I'M

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:50.631
GOING TELL YOU GO TO YOU SEE

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:53.234
AND A BARBARA IS THERE'S

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:55.069
RESEARCH PROPERTY. NEXT BEING

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:56.771
ON. MAKES THE MOST SENSE IS

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:59.674
UNIQUE IS THE- IF YOU'RE URBAN

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.243
CAMP INTO A THAT IT'S THAT IT'S

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:03.778
AN IMPORTANT. BUT I ALSO FEEL

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:05.880
LIKE PART OF OUR JOB IS TO

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:10.551
FIGURE OUT HOW WE- ENCOURAGE.

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:12.520
OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS TO THINK

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.455
OF THE UC AS A WHOLE THIS IS IT

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:15.690
I MEAN IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:17.858
UCLA AND BERKELEY IS REALLY

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:20.061
WHAT WERE HEARING THE MOST TO

01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:23.597
US AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN YES%

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:27.301
I LOVE THE IDEAS THAT FOUND

01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:32.373
THOSE CAN'T BE MY PROPER UP BUT

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.942
IN THE END IT THAT'S THAT. NOT

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:37.011
GET INTO THE- SO I THINK THAT

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:40.881
KNOWLEDGE THAT. THE MORE HEALTH

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:41.482
STUDENT THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:43.317
MIND BUT I ALSO THAT IT'S OF

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:45.086
DEL BALANCE ON THE YOU KNOW

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:48.389
IT'S JUST IN THE SENSE THAT UP

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:51.625
SOME SUCCESSFULLY PATRICK FARES

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:56.163
OR IF IT GEN- IS THERE SO YOU I

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:59.667
A PRE RECEIPT FOR IT TO COME

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:04.138
MAYBE ON HOW TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:06.407
QUICK QUESTION. GOING BACK TO

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:09.377
MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MERCER JEEZ

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:13.247
QUESTION DOES THE- UNIVERSITY

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:17.118
HAVE ENROLLMENT TARGETS IN MIND

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:19.120
TEN YEARS FROM NOW OR OR TWENTY

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:22.390
YEARS FROM NOW WHERE THEY WHERE

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:23.991
THEY EXPECT TO BE. NO NOT THAT

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:26.360
FAR OUT WE BUSTED INFORMATION

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:27.895
FROM THE CAMPUSES TO LOOK OVER

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:29.130
THE NEXT FOUR YEAR PERIOD WE'RE

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:30.698
IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:32.433
INFORMATION. IN ADDITION TO THE

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.235
DISCUSSIONS THAT ENDED UP

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.636
HAVING WITH SOME OF THE

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:39.140
CHANCELLOR'S AND THEY HAD WITH

01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:42.543
OTHER CHANCELLORS TO ABOUT A TO

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:44.712
DAYS IN THE PROPER OF. THAT IS

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:47.515
THAT YOUR POINT. SURPRISE THAT

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:50.551
ARE AT THIS INFLECTION POINT IN

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.486
THE STATE WE HAVEN'T BUILT ANY-

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:54.522
ADDITIONAL CAMPUS THIS WE

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.624
OBVIOUSLY DURING THE TIME THE

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:58.325
NUMBER OF US. WERE AT COLLEGE

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:00.194
YOU SEE WAS GOING THROUGH A

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:00.861
GROWTH SPURT YOU SEE WAS

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:05.099
GROWING SO- OF COURSE AS THE

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.101
POPULATION WAS GROWING THE

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:10.371
STEVE KEEPING PACE. I THINK

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:11.939
QUESTION IS DIVERSITY TO

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:13.641
RECEIVE. HAD ABILITY TO CAN

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:16.911
TEAM TO KEEP PACE IT SEEMS LIKE.

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:17.611
THINGS HAVE SORT OF FALLEN

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:20.214
BEHIND- IN IN THIS IS NOT JUST

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:22.016
A YOU SEE IT'S ALSO WITH OUR

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.684
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MUCH OF

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.920
OUR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE WE

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:27.922
SORT OF HAVE NEGLECTED OVER THE

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:28.823
LAST COUPLE DECADES SO WOULD

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:31.492
YOU SEE NOT. ALONE IN THAT AT

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:35.996
ALL IF YOU WE- THE DOOR. THE

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:36.564
EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:37.131
LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN SORT

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:38.666
PLAYING CATCH UP FOR A DECADES

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.601
OF NEGLECT IN TERMS OF

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:42.837
INFRASTRUCTURE- ON. I THINK

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:45.739
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR. YOU

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:50.511
SEE TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPE OF A

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:53.647
IN ROLE MEANT- TARGETS THEY CAN

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:55.416
HIT IT EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S IT

01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:59.353
IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT- I.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.055
YOU KNOW GO GO BACK TO MY FROM

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:01.722
SANTA BARBARA'S COMMENTS I

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:04.158
THINK YOU KNOW SHE SHE IS

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:06.794
RIGHT- THAT WE DO HAVE TO

01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:11.098
CONTINUE TO- ADVOCATE FOR THE

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:13.501
OTHER SEVEN EPISODES. I THINK I

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:14.935
THINK THE GOOD THE GOOD NEWS

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.170
AND THE BAD NEWS IS I THINK THE

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:20.741
SECRETS OUT I THINK THAT I

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:21.242
THINK ALL SEVEN OF THOSE

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:24.411
CAMPUSES ARE IN HIGH. I MEAN DO

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:26.180
I'M BERKELEY IN USED. THERE IS

01:36:26.247 --> 01:36:27.748
A HUGE AMOUNT OF INTEREST AND

01:36:27.815 --> 01:36:31.085
ALL SEVEN OF THOSE CAMPUSES- I

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:33.454
THINK THAT'S A GREAT I THINK

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:35.489
IT'S GREAT FOR OR FOR THE STATE

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:37.158
OF. IT'S CLEAR THERE'S STILL

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:40.628
MORE TO MAKE A UC DEGREE

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:44.598
REGARDLESS OF CAMPUS ON THERE

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:46.767
THE- SPOT AT ANY IS REGARDLESS

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:48.335
OF WHAT YOUR IN APP BERKELEY

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:50.070
WHERE I YOU'RE A BURST. SO I

01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:54.108
THAT IS THE VERY. I'M I DO

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:57.511
THINK YOU KNOW I'D BELIEVE THAT

01:36:57.578 --> 01:37:00.080
YOU CAMPUSES HAVE BECOME

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.850
ADDICTED TO OUT OF STATE

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:06.854
ENROLLMENT. I DON'T THINK IT

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:08.589
CONTINUES TO BE A FAIR.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:11.325
STATEMENT THAT OUT OF STATE IN

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:15.029
ROMAN INCREASES. BECAUSE OF A

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:17.331
LACK OF IN STATE SUPPORT IN

01:37:17.398 --> 01:37:19.633
FACT SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:24.271
LEGISLATURE WHICH WAS- STARTING

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:25.839
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN OR THE END

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:29.610
OF TWENTY TWELVE. EVERY SINGLE

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.712
YOU SEE HAS RECEIVED AN

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:36.450
INCREASE IN INCREASE IN SUPPORT.

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.018
YET IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:41.021
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN EVERY SINGLE

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:43.891
YEAR WHILE THE STATE INCREASED

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:47.361
THEIR SUPPORT TO THE UNIVERSITY

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:49.296
WHAT HAPPENED. WELL FOR NOT

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:53.667
CURSE IN STATE AROMA WAS FLAT.

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.703
INTEL MYSELF AND MR MCCARTY

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:58.005
ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED WITH THE

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:59.506
UNIVERSITY TO GET IN STATE

01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:01.475
ENROLLMENT UP THE WAS NOT

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:02.776
BECAUSE UNIVERSE DECIDED TO

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:05.412
THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:07.114
LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY THE

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:08.015
SHADE IN THE BUDGET

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:10.551
NEGOTIATIONS BUT- THE CHANCES

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:12.186
ARE VERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:18.359
GROW. OUT OF STATE MOMENT. SO I

01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:20.628
THINK YOU SEE NEEDS TO BREAK

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:22.529
THE ADDICTION OUT OF STATE

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:25.532
STUDENTS. OR THEY NEED TO PAY

01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:26.867
THE STATE BACK FOR ALL ITS

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:30.371
BUILDINGS ALL ITS LAND. ALL THE

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:33.641
INVESTMENTS STATE. BECAUSE TO

01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:35.242
ME IF THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:37.044
BREAK THAT ADDICTION TO OUT OF

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.013
STATE STUDENTS THERE ARE THERE

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.714
HAS TO BE A CHANGE IN THE

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:44.785
RELATIONSHIP. SO TO ME THIS

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:46.020
YEAR I I'VE ALWAYS I THINK YOU

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:48.589
YOU SEE IS ONE OF THE BEST

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:50.190
THINGS THE STATE HAS EVER DONE

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.759
AND I CONTINUE TO STAMP. ONE OF

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.527
THE REASONS WE HAVE THE FIFTH

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:55.496
LARGEST ECONOMY IS PROBABLY

01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:56.497
MAYBE EVEN THE NUMBER ONE

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:57.798
REASON WE HAVE THE FIFTH

01:38:57.865 --> 01:38:59.433
LARGEST CONTINENT. IN THIS

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.036
WORLD. IT'S A REASON THAT WE'VE

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:03.737
BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN TALENT

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:06.340
GROW OUR OWN TALENT INNOVATE-

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:09.777
SO MUCH OF. WHAT HAS. BEEN

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:11.545
INNOVATIVE IN THE STATE HAS

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:14.715
COME OUT OF A UC THIS. I THINK

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:16.850
IT'S ABSOLUTE CREDIBLE BUT- I

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:19.053
MEAN I THINK THAT TWO. TWO

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:21.422
THINGS IS. WE NEED TO ENSURE.

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:23.390
THAT YOU SEE IS PREPARED AND

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:29.596
PLANNING. TO MEET. D. DEMANDS

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:30.864
OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:32.599
TERMS OF THE DEMANDS FOR HIGHER

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:35.035
EDUCATION AND FRANKLY DEMANDS

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.136
FOR A VERY VERY EDUCATED

01:39:36.203 --> 01:39:37.938
WORKFORCE WE LIVE IN A VERY

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:41.875
EXPENSIVE STATE. WE COMPETE YOU

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:43.577
KNOW GOV GOVERNOR BROWN TALKED

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:44.978
ABOUT A LOT LIKE WE DON'T

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:47.147
COMPETE. ON PRICE. WE LOSE THAT

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:50.284
COMPETITION. WE COMPETE. BASED

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:54.188
ON GETTING THE SMARTEST PEOPLE

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:54.955
IN THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE FROM

01:39:55.022 --> 01:39:56.390
AROUND THE WORLD TO COME TO

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:59.927
CALIFORNIA THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:00.994
CHUNK OF OUR ECONOMY THAT'S THE

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:03.263
THAT'S THE REAL PIECE OF OUR

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.998
COUNTRY THAT YOU SEE IS THE

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:06.900
PART OF THE DIFFUSE CARE

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:09.837
CONTINUE TO. EDUCATE IN KEEPING

01:40:09.903 --> 01:40:10.938
MAINTAIN THAT EDUCATION

01:40:11.004 --> 01:40:13.607
CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:15.409
CONTEND IN OF IT. AND I THINK

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.411
ALSO IF IT'S- IF IT IS HE

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:18.712
DOESN'T HAVE ROOM FOR

01:40:18.779 --> 01:40:20.214
CALIFORNIANS WITH THOSE

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.782
CALIFORNIA'S SOMEWHERE ELSE TO

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.618
GOING TO GO TO TEXAS THEY'RE

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:25.285
GONNA GO TO MASSACHUSETTS

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:27.588
THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO IT

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:29.022
ANNOYED GOING TO. NORTH

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:32.826
CAROLINA. CREATE GEN THEN TACK

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:35.596
IN FLORIDA NOT IN SOUTH SAN

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:37.765
FRANCISCO I THINK THAT'S THAT

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:39.400
THAT TO US I THINK IS EVEN

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:42.102
THOUGH THE LARGER CONCERN- AND

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:46.540
I IF THE UNIVERSITY- DOESN'T

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:50.244
OUT IT UP AGAIN WHERE WHERE I

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:51.044
THINK WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO

01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:54.948
WORK- WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:57.885
DEVELOPING A LONG. TERM THEY

01:40:57.951 --> 01:41:00.654
TOOK ALL THE BACK THERE WE HAVE

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:03.223
GOTTEN HAS- TO ME NOT

01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:04.658
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE UNIVERSITY

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:05.893
SERIOUS ABOUT BREAKING THE

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:07.327
CYCLE AND BREAKING THEIR

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:10.097
ADDICTION- BUT I THINK THE

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:13.434
LEGISLATURE IS VERY INTERESTED

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:14.201
IN THAT THE PEOPLE OF

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:17.070
CALIFORNIA ARE VERY INTERESTED.

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:17.771
BECAUSE THEY THEY FEEL LIKE

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:19.973
THEY'RE PAYING TAXES KIDS CAN'T

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.876
GET IN. TO DO YEAR END INTO THE

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:26.980
UNIVERSITY. SO TO ME- YOU KNOW

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:28.248
IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT-

01:41:28.315 --> 01:41:30.417
THAT THIS SORT OF SORT OF

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:33.253
ENROLLMENT LOOK BE DONE AS SOON

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:38.926
AS POSSIBLE BUT ALSO. IT'S.

01:41:38.992 --> 01:41:40.127
YOU'RE HAVING ALSO QUESTION

01:41:40.194 --> 01:41:42.296
ABOUT SAY THAT JUST TO STEVEN

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:44.331
THAT THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND OR

01:41:44.398 --> 01:41:46.533
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.803
TWENTY EIGHT- THE TWO THOUSAND.

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.238
YOU KNOW OUT OF STATE STUDENTS

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:53.707
THOUGH THOSE ARE THOSE ARE

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:54.374
THOSE COULD BE CALIFORNIA'S

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:58.912
LOTS AND AGAIN. WHAT NO NO ONE

01:41:58.979 --> 01:42:01.682
POINT OUT IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:04.251
OF OUT OF STATE A ROLE THAT IS

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:06.920
NOT A U. SEAMERS AT. WHERE WORK

01:42:06.987 --> 01:42:09.957
WITH THANK YOU SEE ELECT THAT

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:12.759
UC SAN DIEGO. SO THAT'S WHAT

01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:15.128
PEOPLE ARE PISSED OFF. IT'S B.

01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:18.932
AS YOU KNOW- IN THIS IS A JOKE

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:20.567
IT'S YOU KNOW YOU'RE BETTER OFF

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:22.269
MOVING TO NEW YORK. WHEN YOU'RE

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:24.071
IN HIGH SCHOOL BEEN TRYING TO

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:25.606
GRADUATE FROM CALIFORNIA TO GET

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:28.742
INTO BERKELEY. IS THAT

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:29.743
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.612
US TO TELL OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:33.847
MOVE OUT OF STATE. SO YOU CAN

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:36.917
GO TO UC BERKELEY. WITHOUT A

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.919
STATE SO YOU CAN GET INTO UCLA.

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:44.391
THAT THAT SOUNDS. LIKE A VERY

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:46.860
POOR WAY TO DO IN ADMISSIONS

01:42:46.927 --> 01:42:48.428
PROCESS FOR IN IN STATE. YOU

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:53.500
NEVER. BUT THAT'S SORT OF WHERE

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:56.370
WE ARE AT AT THIS STAGE IT IS

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:59.106
SOMETHING THAT TO ME IS. NOT

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:01.942
ALL. IT'S NOTHING THAT I CAN

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:04.678
TELL MY CONSTITUENTS I CAN'T

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:07.214
GIVE THEM THE ADVICE TO MOVE

01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:10.384
OUT OF STATE TO GO TO THE

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:11.218
COLLEGE THAT THEY'D LIKE TO.

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:12.052
BUT THAT TOWARDS CHOICE WOULD

01:43:12.119 --> 01:43:16.223
YOU STARTED. LEAVE MANY OF US.

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:18.125
SO AGAIN I THINK IT IS VERY

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:23.564
IMPORTANT TO. HIGHLIGHT HOW

01:43:23.630 --> 01:43:24.164
MUCH EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S CAN

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:27.000
GROW. WHAT THE CAPACITY IS YOU

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.335
KNOW NOT JUST A FOR YEARS BUT

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:29.937
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:33.073
TEN TWENTY YEARS. AND ALSO. HOW

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:40.447
DO WE- HOW DO WE. ABLE TO HAVE-

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:42.215
ADMIT THE GROWTH IN ROLE THE

01:43:42.282 --> 01:43:44.952
GROWTH IN IN STATE CALIFORNIA'S

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:48.088
CUSTOMS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK A

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:50.290
LONGER TERM FUNDING PLAN IS A

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:51.992
GOOD IDEA THE PRE FUNDING THAT

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:55.429
WE HAD IN THE LAST PERIOD IS IT

01:43:55.495 --> 01:43:57.731
IS VERY HELPFUL- CAMPUSES KEEP

01:43:57.798 --> 01:44:00.367
AND TO PATE WHAT THEY ARE GOING

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:03.537
TO HAVE TERMS OF SLOTS AND- UP

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:05.572
ACCORDINGLY IT TOOK OVER A

01:44:05.639 --> 01:44:08.442
PERIOD THAT IN TALKING ABOUT.

01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:10.611
THE CITY OF FORMULA HAS AND DID

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:12.813
THE TARGET. WHAT WE WERE

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:14.081
GETTING IN TERMS AT STATE. FOR

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:16.383
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- SO IT

01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:17.651
ISN'T AS THOUGH OVER THAT

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:20.087
PERIOD WE DIDN'T ENROLL AS MANY

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:21.655
AS SLOTS AS WE WERE GETTING

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:23.090
PAID FOR BEING ABLE TO THINK

01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:26.893
AHEAD ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS-

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.229
AND BEING ABLE TO PLAN TOGETHER

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:32.099

LET'S JUST BE CLEAR THAT

01:44:45.145 --> 01:44:47.381
SOMETHING THAT WAS PASSED ON TO

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:50.784
THE UNIVERSE CAME TO US AND

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:52.119

INCREASE MORE OUT OF STATE

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:04.898

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.078
SCHOLARSHIPS THESE WERE NOT

THIS FOR COUPLE YEARS A LITTLE

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:23.950
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON BUT AFTER WE

STABILIZED AND I'VE BEEN GIVING

01:50:25.552 --> 01:50:27.687

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:29.789
PAST FIVE SIX YEARS WE'VE

01:50:29.856 --> 01:50:32.225
DOUBLED AGAIN NUMBER NINE RIGHT

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:34.327
THAT'S WHAT MAKES A MISTER MARK.

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:36.463

GIVEN. WAY MORE MONEY A YEAR

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.501
AND ALLOW. SIX SEVEN YEARS WITH

01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:44.471
A DOUBLE THE NUMBER. OF NON

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.506
RESIDENT. IS CUTTING INTO A

01:50:46.573 --> 01:50:48.341
SPOTS AND SO JUST THAT'S- US

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:50.310
AND OUR CONSTITUENTS RIVER. I'M

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:54.814
I WILL SAY TO THAT IF WE HAD A

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:56.883
SUITCASE RIGHT HERE OF EIGHT

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:58.818
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT I

01:50:58.885 --> 01:51:02.489
THAT. DOWN BACK. NOW I DON'T I

DON'T. EDUCATION FINANCE A LATE

01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:08.928
SO I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT EVEN IF

01:51:08.995 --> 01:51:11.164
WE HAD THE EIGHT HUNDRED

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:12.966
MILLION RIGHT NOW WE WOULD GO

01:51:13.033 --> 01:51:14.501
AND BUY BACK. WHERE WE WERE TEN

01:51:14.567 --> 01:51:15.935
YEARS AGO TO GO BACK AND

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:18.104
PERCENT I THINK IF WE- HAD

01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:20.640
LIMóN UNLIMITED RESOURCE YEAH

01:51:20.707 --> 01:51:24.177
BUT I THINK YOU TO EVALUATE-

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:25.011
OPPORTUNITY COST AT BUT I KNOW

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:27.313
WE HAVE. JANET TODAY AND THIS.

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:28.481
ONE OF ANY ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:51:28.548 --> 01:51:30.817
TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH HERE SO

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:34.487
OF MISTER MEDINA. YOU KNOW I

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:37.023
EIGHT. THE GREE WITH SOME OF-

MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:41.928
IN MY DISTRICT. WHICH HAS THE

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:43.797
LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF COLLEGE

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:46.533
GOING RATE ALONG PROBABLY WITH

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.134
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:51.337
CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE THE LOWEST

01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:54.040
PERCENTAGE OF A- BACHELOR

01:51:54.107 --> 01:51:57.777
DEGREE IN POPULATION. I'VE I

01:51:57.844 --> 01:52:00.713
REALLY DO NOT HERE A CLAMOR.

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:03.817
FROM MY CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:06.686
FELT SO STRONGLY THAT THEY MAY

01:52:06.753 --> 01:52:09.355
NOT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO UCLA.

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:12.659
CAL BERKELEY I WAS A HIGH

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:13.259
SCHOOL TEACHER FOR TWENTY SOME

01:52:13.326 --> 01:52:16.563
YEARS. AND I SAW WERE STUDENTS

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:18.731
UP WENT TO COLLEGE IN EVERY

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:22.035
YEAR OF A GRADUATING CLASS

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.070
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS I

01:52:24.137 --> 01:52:26.873
THINK THE GRADUATING CLASS OF

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:27.674
POLY HIGH SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.409

REMEMBER CORRECTLY YOU KNOW

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:37.217
FIVE OR SIX. MAY GO TO UCLA.

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:41.421
YOU KNOW MAYBE TWO OR THREE THE

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:45.825
CALIBER GLEE. OF ONE OR TWO

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:46.326
WOULD GO THE IVY LEAGUE

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:50.530
COLLEGES- BUT I DON'T HEAR I DO

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:55.768
NOT HEAR FROM MY CONSTITUENTS.

01:52:55.835 --> 01:52:57.737
THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THEM. I

01:52:57.804 --> 01:53:00.406
THINK MORE IN TO THEM IS THAT

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:01.875
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY BECAUSE I

01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:05.245
HEAR FROM MOTHERS WHO COME TO

01:53:05.311 --> 01:53:06.846
MY OFFICE AND TELL ME YOU KNOW

01:53:06.913 --> 01:53:10.850
THEY DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS ONLY

01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:12.852
TO WAREHOUSE WORK. NO THEY- A

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:14.854
COLLEGE TO GO TO HAVE A BETTER

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:17.690
FUTURE. BUT IT'S NOT

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:20.927

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:26.132
OR OR CAL BERKELEY. BUT I VERY

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:28.201
MUCH SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THE

UC SHOULD BE YOU KNOW FOR

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:33.806
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. I ASKED

THING TOO IS THAT WITH THE

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:13.812
ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT WE

02:09:13.879 --> 02:09:15.514
RECEIVE SINCE THE END OF THE

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:18.117
GREAT RECESSION WE'VE HAD FORTY

02:09:18.183 --> 02:09:18.817
ONE THOUSAND SPOTS THAT HAVE

02:09:18.884 --> 02:09:21.019
BEEN CREATED BY YOU OVER THE

02:09:21.086 --> 02:09:23.355
YEARS- CAMPUSES WHAT WE DO WE

02:09:23.422 --> 02:09:25.591
ALLOCATE THAT. THOSE ENROLLMENT

02:09:25.657 --> 02:09:27.893
TARGETS ARE THOSE NEW SLOTS TO

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:32.698
CAMPUSES THEN AS YOU SEE IT

02:09:32.764 --> 02:09:33.465
THERE IS A- CITY FOR DO SUMMER

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:34.466
COURSE OFF. THEY WILL LAUNCH

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:36.201
THOSE OVER ON THAT SO WE DON'T

02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:37.603
DIRECT THEM FROM THAT FROM THE

02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:38.537
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AT THIS

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.372
POINT TO DO SO. BUT IT'S REALLY

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:41.974
KIND OF A THE GRASS ROOTS OF.

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.675
ARMS OF IF THEY IDENTIFY

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:45.544
PARTICULAR PER ROOM THAT MAKES

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:46.278
SENSE TO THEM THAT THEY'LL

02:09:46.345 --> 02:09:49.281
WATCH THAT WITH THERE ARE SOME

02:09:49.348 --> 02:09:51.416
RUMBLINGS OF PARTICULAR

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:52.384
CAMPUSES THAT ARE KICKING THE

02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:54.853
TOP. LEAVE A STATE SUPPORT.

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.855
PROGRAM ISN'T CASE FOR NUMBER

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:59.091
OF YEARS. SO AS ROAMING GROWS

02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:01.293
WE ARE- SEEING THAT THERE'S

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.328
MORE OF AN APPETITE- FOR CAMPUS

02:10:03.395 --> 02:10:04.630
IS TO SHIFT. SOME OTHER

02:10:04.696 --> 02:10:05.797
ENROLLMENT TO THE SUMMER WHICH

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:07.199
IS GOOD FOR. YOU KNOW.

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.767
ADDRESSING CAPACITY NEEDS AND

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:10.569
THAT SORT OF THING SO I THINK

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:12.938
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK

02:10:13.005 --> 02:10:15.073
YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL. PIECE

02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.543
YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL ROAMING

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:21.079
GROW. IN ACTIVITY CAMPUSES I

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:23.682
THINK I THAT'S THAT'S A US IN

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:24.483
PUTTING IS THE WRITER OKAY HOW

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:27.052
ABOUT THE OFF CAMPUS. CENTER

02:10:27.119 --> 02:10:29.188
DISCUSSION. THROUGH ANOTHER

02:10:29.254 --> 02:10:31.256
THERE IS TALK ABOUT A NEW CSU

02:10:31.323 --> 02:10:34.026
STOCKED IN AND I THINK SANDRA

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:35.427
DINO YOU KNOW GET UNLIMITED

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:36.962
RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE NICE

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:42.434
BUT- IF THAT'S- THE BEST THING

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:44.336
WE SHOULD DO OUR BIGGEST BANK

02:10:44.403 --> 02:10:47.206
BACK WITH LIMITED RESOURCES AND

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:48.774
SO I THINK. WE'LL FOCUSING

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:51.143
EVERYTHING SOON THROUGH. BUT WE

02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:52.778
HAVE SOME OF THESE THROUGHOUT

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:55.647
CALIFORNIA AND- YOUR TALK ABOUT

02:10:55.714 --> 02:11:01.820
THAT. TWO ONE. SURE OKAY NOT AT

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:04.323
THIS TIME THE CENTERS IT'S

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:06.325
ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE FROM AN

02:11:06.391 --> 02:11:07.926
ACT TO EAT PERSPECTIVE TO

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:09.695
EXPECT AND CENTERS THAT IT IS

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:12.998
EXPANDING EXISTING EMPHASIS SO

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:20.005
CENTER BEING USED ALERT MEANS

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:23.508
SPIT. ALSO IT WHAT I JUST READ

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:24.810
SPECIFIC PART OFFERED OUTS BUT

02:11:24.876 --> 02:11:28.614
ON. CAMPUS LOOK TO OUR PARTNER

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.182
WITH OTHER SCHOOLS KIND OF HOW

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:32.818
CAL STATE SAN MARCOS START

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:33.719
STATE SAN MARCOS ACTUALLY

02:11:33.785 --> 02:11:35.821
STARTED AS AN UPPER DIVISION

02:11:35.887 --> 02:11:38.257
COURSEWORK AND IN. ON LOWERED

02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:40.692
OF COURSE WERE TO BECOME A FOR

02:11:40.759 --> 02:11:42.828
FULL UNIVERSITY BUT I THINK

02:11:42.894 --> 02:11:44.796
CAPACITY ASSESSMENT STUDY WILL

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:46.965
BETTER HELP US UNDERSTAND THE

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:49.268
SPECIFIC NEEDS AND THE- AS-

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:52.237
WHERE THOSE. MIGHT AND I THINK

02:11:52.304 --> 02:11:55.807
OVER TIME WHY YOU HAVE THE

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:57.576
CENTERS TO BEGIN WITH IS

02:11:57.643 --> 02:12:00.045
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN AYE IF I

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:04.216
DEMAND. PARTICULAR CAMPUS

02:12:04.283 --> 02:12:06.251
THAT'S IT YOU KNOW LINKED WITH

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:07.686
SAN BERNADINO THEY HAVE A EIGHT

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:09.955
HUNDRED OF ALL TIME EQUIVALENT

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:10.989
STUDENT OR THAT'S BECAUSE

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:12.891
THERE'S BEEN MORE OF A DEMAND

02:12:12.958 --> 02:12:25.837
AND. MORE AGGRESSIVELY PERHAPS-

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:27.306
BUT THEN ALSO THEY THEY DO

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:28.940
UTILIZE THEM JUST IN GENERAL-

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:31.376
BECAUSE THERE ARE PARTICULAR

02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:34.880
NEEDS ON US CAMPUSES. THANK YOU.

02:12:34.946 --> 02:12:38.517
IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY I

02:12:38.583 --> 02:12:39.117
THINK YOU GAVE THE FIGURE THAT

02:12:39.184 --> 02:12:41.553
ONLY 4% OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:45.624
RE DIRECTED RESERVE OF

02:12:45.691 --> 02:12:48.560
APPLICANTS. AND THE GOAL TO

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:49.294
IT'S WHERE THEY BEEN RE DIRECT

02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:53.165
THAT. YES ABOUT FOUR FOUR AND A

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:55.334
HALF PERCENT ULTIMATELY ROLE

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.536
EVEN THOUGH ALL TWENTY FIVE

02:12:57.602 --> 02:12:58.103
THOUSAND WERE ULTIMATELY RE

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:01.173
DIRECT TO A CAMPUS RIGHT SO BUT

02:13:01.239 --> 02:13:05.644
ALL 4% OF THE TWENTY FIVE

02:13:05.711 --> 02:13:07.012
THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE READ

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:09.081
ACTED EVENTUALLY AND- AT WHAT

02:13:09.147 --> 02:13:15.787
ISSUE CAN. STATE SO BROWN OF BY

02:13:15.854 --> 02:13:18.090
TWO WHERE THEY APPLY SO THAT'S

02:13:18.156 --> 02:13:21.126
ACTUALLY NOT EXACTLY THE REASON

02:13:21.193 --> 02:13:23.628
WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:13:23.695 --> 02:13:26.064
STUDENTS DIDN'T COME UP TO XIN.

02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:27.933
OF THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:28.834
STUDENTS WHEN WE LOOK THE

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:31.670
CALIFORNIA REFERENCE THEY WERE

02:13:31.737 --> 02:13:33.638
SEVENTY SAID ABOUT 77% OF THEM

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:35.774
ACTUALLY WENT TO ANOTHER

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:38.977
UNIVERSITY OR IF YOUR ARE CAN

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:43.482
YOU CALL IT. SO THE- BUT

02:13:43.548 --> 02:13:46.618
STUDENT BUT HE IT LOCALLY ACT

02:13:46.685 --> 02:13:47.352
MUCH HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER

02:13:47.419 --> 02:13:49.888
STUDENTS THAT ARE AT TEN LOW%

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:52.791
EIGHT SO ALL STE ARE. DOWN WITH

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:56.495
THIS. SO IT WASN'T. BECAUSE

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:57.763
THEY THEY COULDN'T GO TO SOME

02:13:57.829 --> 02:13:59.030
OTHER PART OF THE STATE THAN TO

02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:08.540
ATTEND. THANK YOU. OKAY YEAH

02:14:08.607 --> 02:14:10.575
THE QUESTIONS GALLAGHER

02:14:10.642 --> 02:14:16.214
QUESTION YES STRONGER. ALSO THE.

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:21.153
DONE. ONE QUESTION I HAD WAS

02:14:21.219 --> 02:14:24.623
AROUND THE AT T. S. IN THAT

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:26.291

DISCONTINUANCE OF IMPACTION IN

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.399

TO PLACE AND WE HAVE. SPREAD

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:32.230
OUT OVER TWENTY THREE CAN. SO

BOUNCES AROUND QUITE A BIT- I

02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:06.697
