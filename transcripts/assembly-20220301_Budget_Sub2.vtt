00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.694
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA I THINK-

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.763
WE HAVE THIS CHALLENGE WITH CAL

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.097

KNOW IT IS A SIGNIFICANT POLICY

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.134

PROCESS WITH UNANIMOUS APPROVAL-

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.944
THAT BEING SAID WE THINK THAT

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.246
THE WAY WE CAN UNDERTAKE THESE

00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:51.381
CHANGES IN THIS YEAR IS TO TAKE

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:52.382
THE APPROACH WE DID WITH THE

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:53.617
COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTITLEMENT

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:56.386
PROGRAM. LAST YEAR AND FUND

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:58.288
THOSE CHANGES AND THEN UTILIZE

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:00.157
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MAKE A

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:02.192
POLICY CHANGES WE OF COURSE HAVE

OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE AS

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:07.063
WELL UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP AND

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:08.565
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TODAY WE CAN GO

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:09.766
THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS WITH

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:11.501
AFTER FULL DISK. ABOUT WHAT THE

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:12.169
- ARE FOR STUDENTS ACROSS

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:15.405
CALIFORNIA YEAH AND I AGREE VERY

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:17.841
MUCH THAT THE- SIMPLIFYING THE

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.043

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.446
IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS IN ORDER

TO BETTER. NAVIGATE AND APPLY-

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:28.452
UNDER ON THE MATTER OF THE

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:30.120
PROGRAM WITH THE FEDERAL

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:33.256
GOVERNMENT IS DOING- AND THAT'S

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:35.392
ANOTHER GOAL I BELIEVE OF WHAT

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:36.426
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE THIS

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:38.228
YEAR IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:41.398

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:43.099
CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:45.235

THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF. WE

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.208

00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.250
CHANGES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:01.685
I THINK THE KEY ISSUE THERE IS

UPPER INCOME LIMIT FOR THIS YEAR

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:57.800

JUST FOR TUITION BUT ALSO. NON

TUITION COSTS. SO WHAT MORE DO

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:15.618
WE NEED TO. COORDINATE BETWEEN

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.453
THIS AND OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.654
TO MAKE IT SEAMLESS WE DON'T

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:20.756
NEED THAT PHD TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:25.661
TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL. THAT'S A

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.063
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.130
ONE WE DIDN'T THINKING ABOUT

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.865
QUITE A BIT AS YOU'D IMAGINE-

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:32.201

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.003
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.238
ELIGIBILITY CEILING WILL BE

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:38.040
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:40.443
GRAHAM FOR A FAMILY OF THE CAL

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:41.410
GRANT PROGRAMS INCOME CEILING

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:44.080
ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. SO THIS MEANS

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:47.550
THAT- REALLY MOST DO YOU SEE AND

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.252
CSU STUDENTS FOR SPEAKING TO.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.487
WHAT ALSO. BE RECEIVING A CLASS

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:55.491
SCHOLARSHIP WORK ON THEIR- THE

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:56.292
PIECE THAT GETS HERE IS THAT

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.827
THERE WILL STILL BE STUDENTS

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:58.661
MORE LOWER INCOME OR MIDDLE

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.463
INCOME. AND FOR ONE REASON OR

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.064
ANOTHER ARE LIMITED IN THEIR

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.666
ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA BASED ON

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.501

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN OUR

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:08.337
PRIOR AGENDA ITEM. SO THIS

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.006
REALLY CREATED SOME COMPLEXITY

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.140

WOULD HELP COVER THEIR TUITION.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.027
WE BELIEVE IT PUBLIC RECORD

WOULD HELP SIMPLIFY THE MESSAGE

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:33.596
THAT WE CAN SEND TO LOW AND

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.364

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.496
WITH ALL. AND YOU HAVE THE

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.565
EXISTING FINANCIAL AID AWARDS

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.567
HOW MUCH MORE WE NEED. TO

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.836
PROVIDE AT A DEBT FREE COLLEGE

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:51.107
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE FULLY

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.208
THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.943
PROGRAM AS IT WAS REVISED IN

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:55.511
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT WITH THAT

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:57.446
REMARK IN MIND GERMAN CURTI THE

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.648
COST THAT WE ARE PROJECTED WITH

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:03.285
TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.286
ABOUT THE PRIOR APPROPRIATION.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.188
AND SO THAT LEAVES YOU WITH MINE

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:06.989
I THOUGHT WOULD PROVIDE LAST

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:09.091
YEAR WHICH IS. JUST NORTH OF A

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:14.764
BILLION. I I'M TRYING TO. THINK

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:15.998
OF THE MAP HERE IT'S TWO POINT

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:16.632
SIX BILLION FOR FULL

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:19.001
IMPLEMENTATION YOU HAVE SIX

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:20.136
HUNDRED THIRTY TWO. MILLION

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.937
PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:24.173
SO ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.775
ADDITIONAL FUNDS ABOUT WHAT'S

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:26.776
BEEN PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.277
BUDGET. THAT MEASURE THAT'S

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:31.547
APPLES TO APPLES BECAUSE THE SIX

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:32.548
HUNDRED MILLION THIS YEAR IS

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.282
JUST. FOR THIS YEAR'S I THINK

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.483
THERE'S COMMITTED TO ANY OTHER

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.551
BASED UPON THE A GROUP THE

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:39.155
FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT LAST YEAR.

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.157
HOW MUCH MORE WOULD BE INCLUDED

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.526
I DON'T THINK IT'S TWO BILLION.

01:07:43.592 --> 01:07:45.961
CAN YOU GET BACK TO US WITH THAT

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:48.397
WITH THAT WITH THOSE NUMBERS.

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:51.233
I'M HAPPY TO DO SO YEAH. OKAY

01:07:51.300 --> 01:08:01.544
THANK YOU SLIMMER REST. THANK

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.645
YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:06.916
PROVIDED I HAVE ONE CONCERN AND

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:09.351
VALUES THAT OFTENTIMES. WELL

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:10.453
REALLY THE STUDENTS THAT WERE

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.488
MOST LOOKING AT OUR THE STUDENTS

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:13.823
THAT ARE MOST DISADVANTAGED THE

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.858
ONES OF THE HARDEST TIME PAYING

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.260
FOR THEIR TUITION. IF WE HAVE

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:22.731
CAL GRANT WITH ITS ISSUES WE NOW

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:23.999
HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:25.234
SCHOLARSHIP THE BASICALLY

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.370
SUPPLEMENTS BUT IF OUR

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.172
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS DON'T GET

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.540
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERYTHING

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:34.143
UNDER CAL GRANT BECAUSE OF THOSE

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:36.812
ITEMS THAT YOU'VE NOTED. THEY

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.348
ARE EVEN MORE DISADVANTAGED.

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:42.718
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION THE

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.520
TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT WE CAN

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:47.056
DO AS THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.125
CARE OF THIS EVEN IF IT'S

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:51.026
TEMPORARY WHILE WE LOOK TO

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:57.533
CORRECT IT'S COMPLETELY.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.635
ASSEMBLY MAJORITY LEADER THAT'S

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.437
SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT IN THIS

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:03.038
DISCUSSION AND WHY WE BELIEVE

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.106
THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:06.208
BUT IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT- AS WE

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:08.344
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS- IT DOES

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:09.645
WORK FOR DEBT FREE COLLEGE IN

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.547
CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN PROVIDE

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:13.215
THAT CLEAR MESSAGE TO STUDENTS

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:14.183
AND FAMILIES THAT IF YOU'RE

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.417
BELOW THIS DEFINED INCOME

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.919
THRESHOLD. WE'RE GOING TO COVER

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.487
YOUR TUITION AND THAT THE MIDDLE

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.022
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMMING

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.790
INSTITUTIONAL AID WILL HELP

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:23.893
FURTHER OFF THAT ALL OF THOSE

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:26.829
OTHER NON TUITION COSTS THAT WE

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:27.463
DISCUSSED IN OUR PRIOR AGENDA

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.065
ITEM WE THINK THAT. IN A

01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:31.667
STATEMENT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE TO

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:32.434
LOWER. STUDENTS AND THEY HAVE.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.370
WHO CURRENT RIGHT NOW DON'T HAVE

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:36.539
THAT GUARANTEED. ACCESS

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.040
SITUATION COVERAGE TO BE CAL

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.842
GRANT PROGRAMS IT WOULD ONLY SEE

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:41.710
A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR WORK BE

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:43.279
COVERED TO THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:46.048
SCHOLARSHIP FOR. SO SHORT OF IT%

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:48.083
IF I MOVED THROUGH THE CHAIR. SO

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.952
SHORT OF JUST TELLING THEM

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:50.452
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.655
EVERYTHING. MY SPECIFIC QUESTION

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:55.057
IS WHAT CAN WE DO. IT I THINK

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:56.892
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISSERVICE IF

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.094
WE ARE PUTTING SO MUCH MONEY

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:02.865
INTO MIDDLE. CLASS SCHOLARSHIP.

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:05.734
WHICH IS IT'S LAUDABLE. BUT IF

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:07.303
WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF THE

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:09.138
STUDENTS WHO NEED IT THE MOST.

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:11.206
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN CARE OF

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.942
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE I THINK

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:14.443
IT'S A DISSERVICE TO THE ONES

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.812
WHO DEPEND ON US MOST TO HELP

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:19.214
THEM PAY FOR THIS TUITION AND

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:22.518
RELATED EXPENSES. SO SHORT OF

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.386
JUST TELLING THEM YOU KNOW

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.788
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:27.890
EVERYTHING YOU NEED- MAYBE WILL

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.558
TAKE CARE OF IT LATER WHAT CAN

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.794
WE AS A LEGISLATURE DO NOW TO

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.029
MAKE SURE. THAT THIS IS TAKEN

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:36.065
CARE OF BEFORE WE START PUTTING

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:37.967
IN SO MUCH MONEY INTO THE MIDDLE

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:45.507
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. YEAH

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.943
AND WE ABSOLUTELY SHARED- THAT

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.578
SENTIMENT AND WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:50.946
THAT AS WE'RE MAKING PATHWAYS

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.247
AFFORDABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS WERE

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.349
NOT LEAVING BEHIND THIS

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.017
POPULATION THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.685
TO MAJORITY LEADER. AND I THINK

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.120
IT'S REALLY A QUESTION FOR WHERE

01:10:58.187 --> 01:10:59.722
THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR-

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:02.257
WISHED YOU- DEDICATE FUNDS AND

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:04.259
HOW YOU WANT TO BUILD ON THE

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.861
INVESTMENT THAT WERE AGREED UPON

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:06.862
LAST YEAR. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.430
NOT SID BELABOR THE POINT WHERE

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:09.231
WE HAD THE STUDENT AID

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:10.833
COMMISSION ARE ARE SO I'M

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.701
INVESTED IN THE CONCEPT OF CAL

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.637
GRANT REPORT. IT REMOVES THOSE

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.005
REMAINING BARRIERS TO KEEP OUT

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:18.907
LOGIN STUDENTS- THERE ARE OTHER

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.342
PROPOSALS YOU CAN CONSIDER THAT

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.611
WOULD BE. HELPFUL LESS DIRECTED

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:24.146
AND LYFT SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.714
IN THAT WOULDN'T REALLY PROVIDE.

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.750
GUARANTEED ACCESS TO STUDENTS IN

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:29.385
THE OUT YEARS OR CREATE THAT

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.353
KIND OF CLEAR COHESIVE SYSTEM

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.821
THAT WE REALLY WANT TO

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:36.592
COMMUNICATE FOR STUDENTS. SO

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.127
FINALLY IF I MAY CHAIR. SO

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.294
BEFORE WE PUT THE ONE. DOLLARS

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.597
IN THE CLASS. IT SOUNDS LIKE IN

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:43.499
RESPONSE TO. TERROR MCCARTY'S

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:46.268
QUESTION IT WAS 200-523-0050

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:48.804
MILLION. NO ONE ON GOING TO TAKE

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:51.840
CARE OF THE ISSUES IN THE CAL

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:54.443
GRANT PROGRAMS FOR THE MOST.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.212
DISADVANTAGE THE MOST OF IT YOU

01:11:57.279 --> 01:12:00.783
NEED OF ASSISTANCE. IS THAT

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:02.184
CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT AND I

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:04.019
WOULD JUST NOTE ALSO THAT ANY

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.487
DOLLARS YOU PUT INTO THE CAL

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:07.022
GRANT PROGRAMS THAT GO OUT TO

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:08.357
YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU STUDENTS

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:10.159
I'VE TOLERATE AWARDS FOR THOSE

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:12.194
STUDENTS THAT ACTUALLY BUYS DOWN

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.896
YOUR CALL. ON THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:15.431
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM BECAUSE THEN

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.032
THERE'S THAT MUCH LESS OF A GAP

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:19.702
IN UNMET FINANCIAL NEED THAT THE

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:20.536
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:21.937
WOULD BE COVERING SO IN A WAY

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.806
YOU'RE PREPAYING TOWARDS MIDDLE

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.574
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IMPLEMENTATION

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:26.842
WELL YOU ARE ALSO DIRECTING

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.844
RESOURCES TO THOSE LOWEST INCOME

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:30.779
STUDENTS WERE SO OFTEN KEPT OUT

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:34.383
AND. THOSE ELIGIBILITY BITTERS.

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:37.252
THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:41.223
THE PICTURE HERE IS AS WE KNOW.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.058
IT'S UNCERTAIN HOW MUCH MONEY

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.293
WE'RE GONNA HAVE IN THE BUDGET

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.295
AFTER THE MAY REVISED REVENUE

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:48.997
NUMBERS COME OUT. AND WE GET OF

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:51.133
COURSE YOU KNOW ALLOCATIONS FOR

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.401
EACH SUB COMMITTEE IN THE

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:53.068
SOMETHING SOMETHING FOR A

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.470
PRIORITY SO LET'S SAY WE HAVE

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:55.170
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:57.239
THINK WE SEE THAT. ASK THIS TO

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.474
NAY COMMISSION LEADERS AS WHAT

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.275
HOW DO WE FOCUS ON OUR BIGGEST

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:01.977
BANG FOR OUR BUCK EVEN THOUGH

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.378
IT'S TWO BILLION TO GET OUR

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:05.581
DREAM SYSTEM. IF WE GET A

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.382
QUARTER OF THAT THIS YEAR AND

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.617
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YOU KNOW

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.652
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HELP

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.087
THAT THE STUDENTS THE NEEDIEST

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.223
STUDENTS LIKE. THIS REYES SAID

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:15.390
WHO SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:19.161
AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.696
STUDENTS WHO. GRADUATE HIGH

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:21.930
SCHOOL ON TIME HAVE IT TOGETHER

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:23.298
THEY FIGURE IT OUT AND THEY HAVE

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:24.333
PARENTS AND FAMILIES FIGURED

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:26.301
OUT. IT'S A STUDENTS WHO WE WANT

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:28.137
TO HELP THE MOST TO. GO BACK TO

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:29.938
SCHOOL FIVE YEARS LATER. WE'RE

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.507
IN THE WORK FORCE SO THE PEOPLE

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:32.808
WE NEED TO GET COLLEGE DEGREES

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.210
AND- AND TO THE JOBS OF TODAY

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:36.612
AND TOMORROW. SO THOSE ARE THE

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:37.913
ONES THAT WERE. FAILING AND

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.349
SELL. THESE LOOPHOLES IN THAT WE

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:42.417
WHICH WE SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDE

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.253
PEOPLE. THOSE ARE THE ONES I

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.321
THINK ARE THE LOW HANGING FRUIT

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.590

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.207
THIS IS SOMETHING I'M MISSING

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:02.243
WITH THAT GREATLY INCREASED

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:03.544
ENTITLEMENT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS

ANYWAY SO HOW DOES THAT WHAT'S

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:12.119
GOING ON HERE. VERY QUESTION- I

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:13.487
THERE ARE SOME OUT ASSUMPTIONS

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:15.656

STILL EXIST AND THE- IT SOME

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.527
PARTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:21.195
AND PARTICULARLY AMONG SOME

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.430
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT. THAT

01:33:22.496 --> 01:33:25.066
BEING SAID I AM PLEASED TO SHARE

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:25.866
THAT CENTER ALEX BETHEA

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.401
CONGRESSMAN JIMMY GOMEZ FROM OUT

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:30.871
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE BOTH

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:31.572
WORK TO A- THAT ISSUE AND TO

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.441
MAKE. CHANGES TO YOUR FEDERAL

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:35.609
LAW AND REGULATIONS LIMITS

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:37.211

I'LL FOR SURE. SO THAT WE CAN

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.715
START GETTING CLOSER TO THAT

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:42.483
GOAL OF NOT ASKING A LOW INCOME

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.418
STUDENTS TO PROVE TIME AND TIME

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:45.386
AGAIN THAT THEY'RE WHAT INCOME

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.721

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:47.989
INFORMATION WITH MULTIPLE

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:49.991
AGENCIES JUST TO GET THE SUPPORT

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:51.258
THEY NEED. TO COVER THEIR BASIC

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:52.393
NEEDS AFTER TRYING TO PURSUE

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.028
HIGHER EDUCATION SO THERE ARE

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.496
EFFORT UNDERWAY THERE HAVE BEEN

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:57.231
FOR SEVERAL YEARS. BUT

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.333
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME- AS

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.668
YOU KNOW PHILIP. DIFFERENCES

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:02.169
AMONG SOME OF THE MEMBER OF

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:03.437
CONGRESS I GET IT BUT LIKE FOR

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:04.472
IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:06.774
HAVE CALVIN RECIPIENTS AND SOME

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:08.576
RECEIVE THE PAL THE FEWEST A PAL

01:34:08.642 --> 01:34:10.044
THAT BASICALLY IS THE FACT IT

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:11.645
MEANS YOU'RE- THE LOWER. OF LOW

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:13.914
INCOME ACOSTA HAS IT EVER BEEN

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:17.451

ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR PARIS.

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:26.961
HAS THAT EVER BEEN. ON THE. SO

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:29.196
FAR MOST OF THE DISCUSS AND I'M

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.198
FOR. WITH THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:31.866
REALLY RARE TRYING TO HELP. THE

01:34:31.932 --> 01:34:33.100
ISSUE ROLE THAT KEEP STUDENTS

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:34.235
FOR APPLYING CALFRESH IN THE-

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.937
PLACE- BUT I WILL SAY WE HAD A

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:37.838
VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:38.706
MEMBERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:40.541
DELEGATION I JUST MENTIONED. WHO

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.076
ARE REALLY LOOKING EVEN FURTHER

01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:45.479
NAP SAY YOU KNOW. WE STREAM THIS

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.081
. AND TO YOUR POINT. USE METRICS

BECOME FINANCE AID APPLICATIONS

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.785
UNDER THAT THE STUDENTS SHOULD

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:52.386
BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS OTHER FORM

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:53.487
OF SUPPORT. SO THOSE

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:55.356
CONVERSATIONS ARE UNDER WAY NOW

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:57.258
BUT- UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:58.859
A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THAT

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:02.063
FEDERAL LEVEL. YEAH YEAH MEAN WE

01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:04.565

FORMER. OF THIS ASSEMBLY BUT- IT

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:10.471
TAKES MUCH MORE THAN A TWO. AT

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.907
THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO MAKE THIS

01:35:12.973 --> 01:35:20.548
A REALITY- WHAT. WHAT THE LOW

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:23.451
HANGING FRUIT PIECES OF THESE

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:26.487
RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT- WOULDN'T

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.889
HAVE THE IS MUCH OF A FINANCIAL

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:36.097
IMPACT THAT WE CAN DO RIGHT AWAY. ID LIKELY THAT WOULD BE-

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:38.532
CONSIDERING HOW WE CAN BETTER

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:39.266
LEVERAGE DATA AND START TO

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:41.102

APPLICATIONS INTO THE PROGRAM

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:43.704
AND WHAT THE ENROLLMENT RATES

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:45.573
ARE WHAT MECHANISMS THERE ARE

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:48.576
FOUR CONNECTING K. TWELVE DATA-

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.377
FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION DATA

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:51.512
WITH BURKE COUNTY OFFICES SO

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.514
THAT CAN TRY TO PRE POPULATE

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:54.482
SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT

01:35:54.548 --> 01:35:57.151
ARE GOING OUT- THOSE ARE. CRAP

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:59.553
LEFT AND THAT THE REQUIRE NEW ON

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.455
EXPENDITURE AWAY SOME OTHERS-

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.457
PROPOSAL MIGHT THERE DID

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:05.359
TECHNICALLY THAT AND WHEN WE OF

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:07.094
COURSE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT AND

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:07.895
THAT THERE ARE. TRANSACTION WAS

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:09.497
THAT THIS SERVICES AGENCIES ARE

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:11.499
MAKING IN THEIR DATA PLATFORMS

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:14.168
THAT WILL MAKE THIS- NOT A D. V.

01:36:14.235 --> 01:36:15.603
BUT PERHAPS THAT'S LOWER COSTS.

01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:17.438
THE OTHER OF COURSE THAT I WOULD

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:19.406
I WOULD HAVE TO CALL IT TEN TO

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:21.075
