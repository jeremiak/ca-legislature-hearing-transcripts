THAT THE DESPITE THE FACT THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE. WHICH ENDED SLAVERY IN THE CONFEDERATE STATES. THE SLAVES IN TEXAS WERE NOT INFORMED OF THIS INTO OVER TWO YEARS LATER. IN THE DISCUSSIONS OF SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR THE ROLE OF BLACK WOMEN THAT THEY PLAYED IN A PATH TO FREEDOM IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED. WOMEN SUCH AS HARRIET TUBMAN SOJOURNER TRUTH. MARY ELIZABETH BOWSER AND MERRY TO VESTRY TO NAME A FEW. OPERATED A SURPRISED SCOUTS CURRIER'S AND GUIDES FOR THE UNION ARMY. THESE WOMEN WHO KNOW FIRST HAND THE EVILS OF SLAVERY CREATED A LEGACY OF STRENGTH AND PERSEVERANCE AND A STRONG FOUNDATION UPON WHICH MANY HAVE STOOD FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW AND I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF BRUCE'S BEACH IN MY DISTRICT AND BEAUTIFUL MANHATTAN BEACH. MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. WILLOW AND CHARLES BRUCE BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS RAN A SUCCESSFUL SEASIDE RESORT. ONE OF ONLY TWO. BEACHES AT THE TIME IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE BLACK CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WERE WELCOMED FOR A DAY AT THE BEACH. OTHER BLACK RESIDENTS CAME TO MANHATTAN BEACH INVESTED AND BOUGHT PROPERTY IN MANHATTAN BEACH. ADDRESSES BEACH BECAME A DESTINATION FOR BLACK FAMILIES. UNTIL SOME OF THE WHITE NEIGHBORS STARTED TO COMPLAIN. AND THE CITY FOLLOWED BY CONDEMNING BRUCE'S BEACH AND TAKE IN THE LAND FROM THE BRACE FAMILY THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN. NOW I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS HISTORY BECAUSE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE WILL BE VOTING ON AN IMPORTANT BILL. SENATE BILL SEVEN NINE SIX. BUT I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF. THAT WILL HELP RETURN THIS BEAUTIFUL OCEANFRONT LAND. TO THE DESCENDANTS OF WILLOW AND CHARLES BRUCE. SO HAPPY JUNETEENTH EVERYONE LET'S GO TO BRUCE IS BEACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER NAZARIAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE C. R. EIGHTY TWO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD. TODAY WE RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THE LIBERATION OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ENSLAVED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE SOME DARK HISTORY IN THE US. BUT IT IS VITAL THAT WE COMMEMORATE THEM AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THESE HISTORICAL POINTS OF INFLECTION. THOUGH THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION OFFICIALLY OUTLAWED SLAVERY IN TEXAS AND OTHER STATES THAT STILL ENSLAVED AFRICAN AMERICANS RACISM DID NOT AND- JUNETEENTH REMINDS US OF THE FIRST STEPS WE TOOK TOWARDS EQUALITY AND JUSTICE. HOWEVER WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE COME A LONG WAY. WE STILL HAVE SOME WAYS TO GO. WE STILL WITNESS DEBATE AND FIGHT AGAINST CONTINUED ACTS OF DISCRIMINATION INEQUALITY AND RACISM INCLUDING MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO VOTE IN THIS DAY AND AGE. LET'S NOT FORGET COLLEAGUES WHILE IT'S WONDERFUL TO CELEBRATE. AND IN A POSITIVE LIGHT CAST THE PROGRESS WE'RE% MAKING. IN ONE HAND ON THE OTHER HAND WE SHOULDN'T BE TAKING VOTING PRIVILEGES OR RIGHTS NOT EVEN PRIVILEGES I'M SORRY VOTING RIGHTS AWAY. FROM THOSE THAT NEED IT MOST. EACH TIME AN IMPORTANT MEASURE LIKE THIS IS BROUGHT FORWARD WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO COMBAT THESE IGNORANT ACTS AND MUST NEVER STOP HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANKS MISTER NAZARIAN MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I UP ALWAYS ASKED WHY DO WE BRING THESE INCIDENTS UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I'M A PROPONENT THAT HISTORY TEACHES US AND IF WE JUST REFUSED TO PULL THE SCAB OF RACISM OFF TO EXPOSE IT TO EVERYONE. THEN WE WILL HEAL AND WE WILL FORGET. THE PAST THAT HAD BEEN DONE WE MUST NOT REPEAT THE INJUSTICES AND MISTAKES. IF WE HIDE THEM FROM EVERYONE ELSE. THE IDEAS FROM HISTORY THAT THIS COUNTRY FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THE EUROPEAN COLONIZERS THAT CAME HERE WITH THE FIRST ONES HERE WHILE THE NATIVE AMERICANS WHO WERE HERE FIRST WORD NOR. THE FACT THAT. THERE WAS A BLACK WALL STREET. ECONOMIC HUB OF AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND. BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL ECONOMICALLY. WE MUST CONTINUE TO REMEMBER WHY WE HAVE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT BECAUSE SEEMS LIKE OTHERS DO NOT EITHER ONE OR BRING IT BACK IN EXTENDED OR JUST FORGET ABOUT IT. WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO TWENTY TWENTY TWO JIM CROW LAWS. THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GONE BUT IF WE LOOK AT HISTORY AND LOOK AT WHAT'S BEING DONE IN OTHER STATES WE KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING IT BACK. WE NOTE. THAT A WHITE LIE. CAN KILL AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE CHARGE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT LIKE EMMETT TILL. AND IN HIS LATER HAVE RECANTED. BUT HE'S STILL DEAD. THE REASON WHY WE BRING THINGS UP LIKE JUNETEENTH. IS BECAUSE ABRAHAM LINCOLN DID EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO. HE IT ENACTED IT IN. ONE ONE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT THAT ALL STATES. AND ONE THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE AND EVEN THEN. THE STATE OF TEXAS STILL IGNORED AND WE DIDN'T GET OUR FREEDOM MY PEOPLE IN TEXAS MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN TEXAS ONE FREE UNTIL JUNE NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY BY. THE REASON WANNA KEEP REMINDING PEOPLE ABOUT JUNETEENTH TEAM IS BECAUSE JUSTICE IS DELAYED. IT WAS DELAYED THEN AND CAN BE DELAYED NOW IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT IT HAPPENS IMMEDIATELY. WE MUST ALWAYS KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES OF THE PAST WE DON'T WANT TO REPEAT IT WE'RE DEALING WITH IMMIGRATION ISSUES. THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW CHILDREN ARE TREATED AT THE BORDER. WE MET WE GOT TO WORK REAL HARD TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T TURN INTO WHAT MY PEOPLE EXPERT EXPERIENCE WITH FAMILIES BEING. TORN APART. IF WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE VOTING RIGHTS. THAT PEOPLE DIED FOR NINETEEN SIXTIES. BETTER NOW BEING RIPPED APART IN SEPARATE STATE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WE NOW KNOW WE NEED TO FIGHT EVEN HARDER. TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PRESERVE THOSE VOTING RIGHTS. FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT JUST FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT. IF WE ENACT A LAW HERE ON THIS FLOOR IN SOME COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DECIDES IT DOESN'T WANT TO ENACTED FOR TWO YEARS HOW WOULD YOU FEEL. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT COUNTY IF THEY DELIBERATELY WOULD NOT ENACT A LAW THAT WE ENACTED ON THIS FLOOR. THAT'S WHY WE TALK ABOUT THE C. R. EIGHTY TWO THAT'S WHY WE KEEP BRING IT BACK JUNE TWO. JUNETEENTH BECAUSE THE LESSONS FROM THAT TIME. ARE STILL PREVALENT RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE ARE NOT AVAILABLE USE THAT COLLOQUIAL WOKE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING AND TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS. THEN HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF. AND IT'LL BE ON US. BECAUSE WE LET IT HAPPEN. WE NEED TO SUPPORT ACR EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU RESTAURANTS WHERE. SAY NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION.

LINDA'S REPUTATION EXTENDED BEYOND THAT OF AN ADVOCATE FOR ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO BE IN KNOWN AS A FIERCE UNION LEADER WHO ENSURED THAT WORKING INDIVIDUALS WERE GUARANTEE NECESSARY PROTECTION. SHE TRULY DEDICATED HER LIFE TO UPLIFTING THE LIVES OF WORKING PEOPLE WHAT GUARANTEED TO ALWAYS RESPECTFULLY LISTEN AND LEARN FROM OTHERS IN THE MOVEMENT TO MAKE CHANGE AT THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE LARGEST UNIONS IN LOS ANGELES. SHE WAS KNOWN AS A STRONG HIS VOICE IN PROMOTING UNIONIZATION AS A TOOL TO CLOSE THE WIDENING ECONOMIC AND RACIAL DISPARITY. LINDA WAS A DEDICATED LEADER IN OUR LABOR MOVEMENT IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE. IT IS THE WORKING CLASS INDIVIDUALS AMERICA WILL MAKE OUR NATION RUN ESPECIALLY AS EVIDENCE AND THEIR DILIGENT AND SACRIFICE. TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. UNFORTUNATELY LIFE WAS CUT SHORT. SHE PASSED AWAY AT THE YOUNG AGE OF SIXTY EIGHT. LINDA IS SURVIVED BY HER HUSBAND LEAGUE DENT THREE CHILDREN AND SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN. AS WE TAKE THIS TIME TO CELEBRATE THIS TRAILBLAZER'S LIFE WAS ALL RECOGNIZED AT LINDA'S LOOP ROAD TO SEE WILL LIVE ON AS WE CONTINUE.
