00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:37.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SALE OF THE BALLOONS. I'M JUST

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CURIOUS HOW MANY WHAT WHAT WAS

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:40.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE RATIONALE AND BANNING

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:40.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

MANUFACTURED IN CALIFORNIA.

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:49.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THE ISSUE FOR GOING WITH THE

MANUFACTURERS IS THAT TYPICALLY

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:53.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE DOLLAR STORES DON'T DO

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:55.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ANYTHING. SO THERE IS A

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
REQUIREMENT WHICH.

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
A DOCTOR EGGMAN THIS.

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:02.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

STORE THEY DON'T BOTHER.

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND SO WE THINK IT'S A LOST

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
CAUSE TO WORK WITH THE
RETAILERS.

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:15.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:17.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MANUFACTURES TO DO THIS IT'S NOT

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LIKE THIS IS A CALIFORNIA

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:21.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROBLEMS IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM.

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
BUT WE DON'T HAVE.

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:25.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A NATIONAL CONGRESS ANYMORE

THAT WHEN THE MARKET WAS MATURE

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND IN THE ACT IT SAYS VERY

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CLEARLY. THAT THESE ARE THE

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:52.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVERY INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:05.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
POTENTIAL DANGERS.

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:07.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE CHOICE OF HIGH TAXES COMES

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:08.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE OF ALCOHOL

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:09.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%

THE RESEARCH ON ALCOHOL AND

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:12.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
TOBACCO IS CLEAR.

YOU KEEP THE PRICES ARTIFICIALLY

HIGH.

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:16.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

IT'S TO DETER YOUNG PEOPLE THE

INITIATIVE WE THINK IT'S TOTALLY

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PREMATURE TO DO THIS WE THINK IT

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:07.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD HAVE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE

00:56:07.897 --> 00:56:09.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
EFFECT OF WHAT.

YEAH DOT ORG.

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:40.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THINK THAT AND NUMBER CAN BE A

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:41.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LONG MILE AND A QUESTION I KNOW

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU'RE PINCHING TODAY MISTER

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:44.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOCTOR WOULD. UP BUT THIS IDEA

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:46.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
OF OF PRE MATURITY.

00:56:46.102 --> 00:56:47.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE MAY REVISE BECOMING OUT WE

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:50.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILL SEE WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ARE WHAT WHY THE RUSH.

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:54.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WELL I THINK I THINK YOU'RE

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GONNA SEE THE ACTUAL NUMBER TO

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:56.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REVENUE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOWER SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROJECTED AND I THINK THAT IS

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:01.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
TAX BURDEN ITSELF.

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:05.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDUSTRY I THINK TO GET STARTED

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:09.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LICENSE FEES ARE VERY HIGH.

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:12.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOCAL LOCALS HAVE ADDED ON

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:13.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TAXES AS WELL WITH THE YOUR

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:15.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
COUNTIES OR CITIES.

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:17.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO YOU'VE TAKEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:17.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ARE THAT ARE PAIN AND I

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DON'T THINK IT IS THE MISTER

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:20.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
LACKEYS NOTES HERE NINE

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:21.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXAGGERATION FORTY FIVE PERCENT

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:24.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TAX BURDEN. ADD TO THAT THE FACT

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THESE BUSINESSES CANNOT

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS EXPENSES

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:29.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
LIKE.

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAGES UTILITIES BECAUSE OF A

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FEDERAL TAX CALL CALLED TO

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:34.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHTY E.. DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:36.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DO THAT OUR STATE FOLLOWS THAT

00:57:36.686 --> 00:57:38.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS WELL SO THE TAX BURDEN IS

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:39.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY MUCH HIGHER

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAN THAT. AND I THINK THAT SOME

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:42.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PLAYERS IN THE IN THE IN THE

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:43.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MARKET ARE JUST SIMPLY SAYING.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL I'M I'M JUST I'M JUST NOT

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:47.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
READY TO GO THERE YET AND SO WE

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:48.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ARE NOT SEEN THE NUMBER OF

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:50.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BUSINESSES COME FORWARD I

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BELIEVE THAT WE THOUGHT WERE

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:52.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOING TO AND WE'RE NOT SEEING

00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:54.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE REVENUE COMING IN FOR THE

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TAXES AND SO. SO I WOULD AGREE

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH MISTER BACCHUS THAT THAT

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT THE IDEA WAS THAT AT A

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:00.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POINT WE WOULD HAVE A ROBUST

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MARKET WITH A BILLION DOLLARS A

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAR IN TAX REVENUE. BUT I THINK

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:04.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAN THE

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACTUAL NUMBERS IN THE FIRST

00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:07.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
QUARTER ARE WOEFULLY.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOEFULLY BELOW THE PROJECTIONS

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I THINK THAT'S A CHALLENGE

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO WHEN THE LEDGE IN TWO

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN.

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:14.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
WE WERE ACTUALLY.

00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:17.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WORKING ON ON TAX NUMBERS.

00:58:17.427 --> 00:58:19.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND ADDS THAT WAS WORKING

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:20.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THOSE

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NUMBERS WERE ACTUALLY LOWER THAN

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT IS IN THE INITIATIVE NOW.

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:23.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE WE LEARNED I THINK WE

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:25.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
LEARNED.

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:26.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
FROM THE INDUSTRY.

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:31.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BALANCE BALANCE.

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REPEAL THE TAX REVENUE IN THE

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TAX BURDEN SO.

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:36.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S THAT IS. THAT IS HOW I

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
SEE IT I DON'T I.

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:39.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW IN A PERFECT WORLD IT

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:41.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAD

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAD THE ABILITY AS A AS A AS A

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:44.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BODY TO ESTABLISH THE REVENUE

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:46.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT THE. THE OF THE ACTUAL

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ATTACKS LEVELS BUT WE DON'T AND

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:49.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT'S PART OF THE STATUTE

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:50.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ITSELF. BUT I AS I DON'T THINK

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ITS REPORT PREMATURE.

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:54.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF WE WANT IF WE IF OF OUR GOAL

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE WE

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:57.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE AS AUTHORS. IS TO COME BACK

00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:59.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE ILLICIT MARKET BRING

00:58:59.068 --> 00:58:59.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
EVERYBODY TO REGULATE

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:00.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
FAIR.

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:03.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
AND I THINK THAT.

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FORTY FIVE PERCENT IS PRETTY

00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:07.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TOUGH ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU NOW HAVE. THE INABILITY TO

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:11.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS EXPENSES

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT A FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL THE

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:14.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
TAX BURDEN.

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:14.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT GOES WAY BEYOND FORTY FIVE

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PERCENT OF THAT POINT.

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:17.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT WAS.

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WITH THE

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:21.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
INITIATIVE.

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
I I THINK THAT.

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:24.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:25.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DID THE VOTERS SUPPORTED.

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:28.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
I.

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:29.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT WAS A SIXTY FOUR PAGE

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:29.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INITIATIVE THERE'S A LOT OF

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INFORMATION THERE I THINK THAT

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE PUBLIC CLEARLY WANTED.

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:35.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES

00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:36.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECRIMINALIZATION THE ABILITY

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR ADULT USE I THINK PEOPLE

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALIZE THAT WAS A LIE DETAIL IN

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT IN THAT INITIATIVE AND.

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:41.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
YOU KNOW.

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:43.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
I.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
I.

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:46.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DID YOU ALL READ THE SIXTY FOUR

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:49.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PAGES.

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:49.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I DON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE DEAD

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:51.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

SOME PEOPLE CALL IT TO THAT

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGULATED MARKET WOULD BE. AND

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:17.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW THAT'S

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:18.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
NOT HAPPENING.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND YOU'RE ONE IS SO CRITICAL

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:21.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR FOR THE TRANSITION WERE WERE

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
JUST IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF

TO MAKE SURE THAT AS MANY.

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:27.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INDUSTRY MEMBERS ARE MOVING OVER

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO TO THE REGULATED MARKET BEING

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIA BUSINESS LIKE ANY

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:31.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OTHER BUSINESS PAYING THEIR

TAXES CREATING GOOD JOBS.

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:33.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SORT OF COUNTER INTUITIVELY IF

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:40.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
YOU LOWER THE TAX RATE.

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:41.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU CAN INCREASE THE TAX REVENUE

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND THAT'S NOT JUST A

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:44.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HYPOTHETICAL ACADEMIC.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:46.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROPOSITION THAT'S WHAT WE SAW

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HAPPEN IN THE STATE OF

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:48.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

OREGON.

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:52.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:54.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE TO BE A WIN WIN IN THAT IT

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:55.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAN GENERATE MORE REVENUE BY

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:56.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LOWER THE TAX RATE AND HAVING

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:59.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MORE TAX PAYERS COME OVER. TO

NUMBER TO HELPING ROUTE OUT AS

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THAT THAT

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ILLICIT MARKET.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT WHICH WHICH UNDERCUTS THE

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULATED MARKET AND HELPS GIVE

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

IN THIS CASE NOT HAPPENING WHICH

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:39.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:41.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE MOVING OVER TO

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE RATED MARKETPLACE SO WE

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINK THIS IS A A A. A PRO.

LEGALIZED AND REGULATED REGIME

YOU KNOW IT IT.

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:57.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRY TRY TO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

THAT THE REVENUE IS.

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BOB AT AND WHERE IT'S GOING AND

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND AND TO THE PEOPLE THAT IT IT

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUPPORTING THAT THEY'VE REMAIN

HAPPENING

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I IS NOT COMING AND WE THINK IT

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:13.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT'S MORE LIKELY TO WITH THIS

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:17.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROPOSAL.

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:17.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOOD TO THE QUESTION WHAT AGAIN

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%

FORWARD.

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT I AM I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OPEN TO NEW INFORMATION BUT

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EFFORT COME WHATEVER MAY BE IF

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:34.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IF WE SEE IN MAY THAT.

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:37.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REVENUES ARE STRONG AND ILLICIT

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:39.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MARKET IS IS IS SHRINKING AT A

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:41.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RATE THAT'S THAT THAT IS.

FOR ME THE ISSUE WAS MORE ABOUT.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IN SOME CASES EXORBITANTLY.

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO THE POINT THAT IT'S ALMOST

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:57.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCENTIVE TO NOT GET INVOLVED OR

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

INCENTIVIZE AND BRING EVERYONE

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:07.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

MARKET OR THE UNDER MARKET

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:11.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY HARD. AND SO OF REVENUE

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:13.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THAT'S ONE THING.

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:15.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT COMES AND. MORE IMPORTANT

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FOR ME IS THE SAFETY.

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE BIGGER THE BLACK MARKET

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
