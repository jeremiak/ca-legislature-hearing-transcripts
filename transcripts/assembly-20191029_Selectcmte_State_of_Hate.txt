Understand it and the address it and I want to again thank cal state San Bernadino for hosting us and partnering with us and again- from assembly just forty assembly member James Ramos we also have with us here today- representing all the representing the beautiful- Inland Empire assembly member Jose Medina assembly member Eloise radius and- senator. Richard Roth. Thank you. Now we're all here to talk about a particular topic today and unfortunately white supremacists in the United States of experienced a resurgence in recent years the- wake up call for all of us I suppose was the unite the right rally in Charlottesville- that is not that long ago was twenty seven. Teen at route extracted about six hundred extremists from around the country and sadly ended and deadly violence. Modern white supremacist ideology is centered on the assertion that the white race is in danger of extinction found a rising tide not quite people who are controlled and manipulated by Jews. A white supremacist believe that almost any action is justified if it will help to save the white race. The hard to speak- but sometimes it's hard to speak- in accurate terms about some of the things going on in our country now after the twenty sixteen election white supremacists- which also frequently known as the all right- but grew. Our on line active them through and with group in order is in. In tactics such targeting. College campuses like the one we're on today. The all right also expanded to its propaganda efforts through tactics like podcasting in world of online games where. Are they targeted an influence young impressionable individuals. Our who were listening and readily of. Audience violence and crime represent the most serious problems emanating from the white supremacist movement white supremacists have killed more people in recent years than any type of domestic extremist fifty for of all domestic. Stream is related murders- of all. Stream related murders. Of them were committed by white supremacists. And this is not just people who have adopted this as an ideology it is also who are influenced by the ideology- or by the rhetoric and so- I just this past weekend we serve the one year anniversary of the tree of life synagogue attack that occurred in suburban Pittsburgh where eight people were killed- the LA perpetrator of that process he- was found to have white now. List directly on. His cell hard drive on his computer. Murmurs in terror plots represent only this guy's got a of this kind of file. As there are many more pensive. That may have ended in by. Including attempted murders thoughts weapons and explosive violence but they didn't. Because I are at law enforcement was able to get their first in addition white supremacists engaged in a lot of non ideological. Including crimes of violence women and drug related crimes. Well these groups represent only a small. A small. The overall population they are not in sick again in their influence and are becoming increasingly ticketed and organized in some cases they have formed alliances and created umbrella organizations is the national front they have changed their parents to seem more professional and rebranded their organizations with adopted names like the national policy institute to appear more academic. An effort to change the political landscape they have created political is like the American Freedom Party to elect local state and national candidates and it is. That their mission is to infiltrate the mainstream and attack American values. So what do we do how do we slow down this proliferation how do we diffuse this growing type of hate how can we bounce free speech with incendiary hate speech on so I made yeah. As it is in our thirties how do we prepare our communities to be able to handle potential for taste. Hosting hearings says these. Will guide us I hope towards finding answers to these questions and more which. Out will allow us a better ability to take on these things head on. Today we have with us for expert presenters who will be covering different. Nationalism at C. outlined in the agenda after they have concluded their presentations- week of bill around five thirty will be. Comment period.

Bowers Bowers believed in something called the replacement is been mentioned previously. On about among white can live as well genocide immigrants are brought into the country with a specific person of rip restricted purpose of replacing or genocide white people mainly through- birth rates. Badly with today's. Witness sedan after incident of burger citing. This full op including just five this group that have happened it passed. Positive result did emerge from Charlottesville. The tragic death of their higher counter protester a number of the new site internet sites belonging to these white supremacists or white nationalists were de platformed and excluding the aforementioned daily stormer. Sites such as go on me and Patrick. Now almost white this page and the credit card providers- said out not when they tried to set up their own sites do the same thing. In addition the largest social media networks including Facebook YouTube took a very have a closer look at their own rules and began removing white nationalist postings. This has moved many but not all the white nationalist sites in the individual. To turn platform to be on the screen well this is our in many que is echo chambers them so also you present a danger. After to the deadly event listed the previous law. These it's rob with adult. Urgent for us to take action. A host of no less. No less violence in smaller groups in loan actors have sprung up in the past few years include. Thank you know not be Adam office. This is rob about movement and the prop boys scribe cells as well. In this part of something. That we all right is this. Man is fear. Interesting enough others have described. This group as as a multi racial white supremacy group. Because they have they have- tried to change their image and even have used a front man from one of their- one of their divisions that is an African American but the philosophy still remains the same. Two final category so like to draw your attention to are gaming and messaging. With the loss large so the meeting last six trips have looked into coming. In become a. To contact potential met since the most popular names are used to promote this is what. The in home. Which is in discordant which have and million just private. Budget was being young. In addition game which makes available. Why which were used in the in the recent attack on the synagogue in Halle Germany just this past year on could pour. And live streaming was also used in Christ in the Christchurch attack and would have been used in the PO a synagogue attack except they had it he had a technical glitch the social network providers inability an apparent lack of interest in solving this issue despite calls from the Simon Wiesenthal center and others is both glaring. And unacceptable. This is just one one. A. Truck games or at night. The most popular games a popular game in two thousand eighteen. Excerpted messaging apps have been used by both white nationalist and Islamic terrorists with impunity. On multiple occasions I have personally made near instantaneous contact with white supremacists and even ISIS figures in Syria. Just wall hold my phone. If you wish and is present Lake do this imagine what she'll followers can a cop. If they believe in the lot. Back to the- national socialist movement you to say AB is also shown on there. On with uber of others. That were we will have been you spot the- telegram is another app that has become extremely popular the white nationalist says it offers both one to one communications- and billet to create a regular feet if you download telegram subscribed to this feed. You can get their messages on a regular basis- and del have hyperlinks and- take you right into the to whatever propaganda they're promoting at the time. In conclusion let me thank you again for dry much needed attention to the subject of hate as a state we need to increase our awareness and monitoring and force our existing laws and determine where we make might. Be digital progress. The internet has become the fuel that powers much of the hate and violence resulting from white nationalist ideology. To this end the Simon Wiesenthal center's created a program to discuss the perils of social networking with middle and high school students. Been able to make this program available in southern California through a cal yes grant. Piloting preventing violent extremism programs. We need to continue to repeat such. We need to continue to reach young people in this manner in the hope that we can avert them from. A full activity in the future thank you. Thank you very much next up we have deputy sheriff Greg Jones the community liaison with the San Bernardino county sheriff's department to keep us a long term perspective on this issue. Thank you very much. Hello okay. Thank you very much. I would like this I would like to think because these aboriginal and all the Assemblymembers. And are senator center Roth- and also the pay for this opportunity- I represent assembly you know county department ensure John it man. And it was a pleasure to be here. My perspective from this a little bit different. Which you just heard what you just seen is extremely in detail- it's very this topic is very very happy it's a hard topic to talk about- it's one of those things that being in the community liaison. Where are county I hate always comes up. Always comes up it is a discussion that is definitely need to be had. You may not want to talk about it is definitely needed. And the only way to talk about it is in a former this so like to thank you. I really want to get to. And explain from a personal standpoint- when law enforcement response to calls for service- we don't always see- what in and in the end I season. Tom what we see some more likely as a hate incident. Individuals have a freedom of speech regardless of how an individual may or may not feel about it. The hard part is investigating hate crimes as all. One of the key incidences that to be a crime. I'm gonna go through my presentation is not as long as my counterparts. I just wanna give you a very brief understanding because I'm very interested to hear from. Jeff. One of the thanks of hate crime it has to be within the seven in the Decatur. Hate crime mean to cut back in order. Our part because. Receive so the big. Yes nationality rate at the. Region's Tory Xin. The per room. More of these actual seat the rest. And the heart. That's the hard part. When it comes we see a lot of hate these days in the media. We see a lot of it on the net. And also the state level- whether you're on one side of the party or the- party. These are really part are cut our county or state or. You don't have a look see hate. When we get hate. We within one of these characteristics. The difference is when someone there is a hate incident. It's either if all under. Hey by. This will protect other person right most. Examples include in calling in Salt. But it's just being hate real in a public place. Meeting bill on your own prop. In this room alone. How many individuals have been a victim. I hate incident the going back. So if you really think back everyone has been a victim of it in support of some type. And it affects everyone. When it comes a speech the first clip. The issue with that is. Speech protect most speech. We just three of the if the for her words. The speech number two. Right perjury black I'm in. Section can see. In within say like how do we are confined to education within our law enforcement officers are law enforcement health standardize Bob hope's piece all. Was gonna. Our training is my post. Like most states in the in state. The our prisons. Some go. Under the guidelines. It's the same throughout the entire United States. It's not. We're very forty. Every off to me go to training we what we get the necessary information. From post. We received approximately- right now it's twenty four weeks of. Within those four weeks we have approximately two hours the deals will culture per city. Implicit bias. Within that we recognize that the culture- within the cal thing California's pass if you. We look at. So what's for our enemy in for every person see our camp to our enemies every a and C. we even have outside agencies riverside county. Agencies north with me. We're trying to. Negative. If somebody actually. Or the right I'm it with it. Taking that into the six months almost impossible. So when we come across with the public and they want to express that their a victim of a hate. It's our responsibility in law enforcement. To give an understanding of what hate it hate speech or hate crime maps. We should now. The hard part is our officers are very challenged. It's not an excuse at all but I do need to make a very clear and hopefully we can understand that include our panel. That when it comes to culture diversity. We're given a lot information. But not just like everyone here has been affected by hate of hate speech I hate incident it's not clear when it comes a law. For one it has to be a violation of the law. When we go back. When it comes I hate crimes we are taught laws related take Raimes does. Related impact of crime best get in documentation. We are trying to the site. The initial investigation is not by an officer or a deputy. I'll go to the law to a scene doses of the church Gen. They will get a good treatment for council or whatever is needed. We have. We will. But the basic investigate is all basic education. Is hammer the lowest also a- is it. It will be. Eight cation bearable. Mason the detective FOR investigator will look at in a raven enough information from disability the tender nationality race religion sexual orientation association with the person group of one or more of the perceived characteristics. From now will look at the local playgroups. Look at the local organizations we'll look at the patterns that are being developed within our our our sister agencies surrounding counties. Their crimes have been committed well look the patterns- we are very fortunate that our department as part of a regional task force. That task force- is made up of multiple agencies within southern area. We meet quarterly at the anti defamation league. We meet with other individuals- I can't go into detail all the different agencies because some of that is confidential. But I can't tell you that our regional partners. Some of the liaisons are with the FBI. Sometimes we were on a local. Sometimes group like a group that Jeff. For the national. A lot of the hit happens within our own state in a rural county. This is are coming from the area. It is very deceiving. I was looking at the city it's with you to. I've. I was very aye right that is Lara county it's not always over twenty thousand square miles for this year alone we've only documented seven hate crimes. This year. Last year was twenty. So the question comes up. The reporting for the team's not wanting to be victims they afraid or the exchange is under reporting is it on the Japanese or the officer side is a training or experience. This is just phone the number a little- but said of the tax. This is this for now this is our our alone. It is how do we about hate crime how do we truly investigated is it a hate speech Hey incident. We do it has crime. A lot Hey there were saying is starting at the university at the university level a lot of his to social media. Live it is to the gaming systems. A lot of his on the national level. It's not hard to find a hate group of some type. Issue with. You have individuals going seeking out individuals who feel like they're being pushed aside. In their grooming them. It's starting in the schools. One of the aspects of the way one person is handling the their hate crimes is that we're taking a deeper look into what is what is the ultimatum or what is the actual what is the evidential. What is at the root of the issue. If you feel the been a victim were you know a victim please report it. I cannot stress that enough I would have to think that we have more hate crimes in just five or seven with our own county. If you're from outside county like riverside or Los Angeles. Sometimes we look at certain counties is with more of a population. But if it is room alone if we've had many individuals been affected by hate. Think about all the individuals who are not. Because they don't want to be percent they don't want to be on social media. They don't want to be verbally and there can be verbally attacked. About casein investigating hate crimes. They're very hard very hard to prove. Look at the intention. The larger ones were the other rallies and you have somebody putting a truck through a group of individuals the easy to investigate it's a motivated that person to kill somebody did not look like them because of eight. Park ones is if you have in our county the which with the incident. On a school bus where you have kids who hanging a noose. Outside of a school bus. Driving down the road. It's eight is children so what do we don't want. We start with educate. With with going out talking visuals we meet with Burke. We meet with individual that may not agree with us meet with groups that made that. I'll be with us. But we need each and everyone of you when you see something is not a slogan we see something say something. Become part of the change we need your help. We need every is assembly members help because we have a closet thank change. Done because nobody's ever feel like a victim. No reserve right I can't report something or I don't mean anything. Hate is hate. Thank you. Thank you our final speaker is Mister Jeff scoop who is the former leader of the national socialist movement welcome and thank you for being here. Thank you- assembly member bloom I'm honored and humbled to be here and nam. All the on the assembly thank you very much. Where to talk a little bit about- the start out with inside right national. Look it by not is America this. This I'm was. Two years ago. Seven thousand seventeen. Actually some. This just. I'd like to apologize to the local community for- depart my organization had in. Some of the incidents that took place here over the years. It's not easy to get up here and after twenty seven years in the movement to admit that you were wrong that- the life that you lived. My entire adult life was wrong in in correctional so- here with me a little bit of from- slow in the- delivery of the speaking here you know I spoke for many years in the national socialist movement and I can tell you. I don't all those years this is probably one of the hardest speeches- I've ever had to give because- it's not easy to admit one's wrong with. For the past so let's move on here. In the early years- just like to tell you a little bit about my story and- where I come from and all and so on so you can kind of get an idea the public can kind of get an idea of where how people get involved in this movement and- going forward from that- that's me as a as a small child. And so we all start out like this. Yeah this is a- one. Of my people that. Are we're all human in a lot time see. I think out in the outside world because of Haiti because the nasty things that a white. Man has done- especially some of the horrible incidents like we have we heard about here today like the synagogue shootings the mosque shootings and stuff like that. I think it's easy to dehumanize people- and so to realize or or to believe that- we're not dealing with human beings here so- at the risk of coming off as an apologist for these people I certainly am not that but I want people to understand that- you know this is a this is a two way street and someone explain kind of how. And why I join the movement. Can't see this picture very well this looks like a rally I think this is here in California. I also want to. Get into a little bit of a cop deal. People to move a lot of. That. All this is about. Do you eight some I can tell you some I come from a middle class home I didn't have a story like a lot of the other performers do where they were beaten up they were bullied they came from all one family- home- they had all these problems with drugs or or her struggles and things like that I came from a very good decent. Normal middle class family and I got brought into this movement I was in this movement until. March of this year. Is so people can come from all walks of life and get involved in this sort of thing. Com. So there's me again. This was a long time ago. Nineteen ninety. And Rick. Find find common now please hello with one that ample religion. The US and they're there. I just Christian idea and we I mean to the point that I recall it was not target at one Civic we tarp that you think could. Up specific things like religion. And give them an identity which says that the white race is the chosen people of god. Experiences if someone came to us and said you know- for example a female I had been raped by somebody of another race we would play on that we would we would focus on that issue because once they're in there and then some of the other things that. Maybe they didn't agree with or didn't understand everything. If we get him in the door we get him in the door that's all or that's all we were trying to DO. Hatreds so someone came to us and said they don't like black people or they didn't like Jews you know we would expound on that we had literature specifically tailored to all of those different things whether it was- crimes between the races whether it was the Jewish question whether it was. God that was saying it's religion we had things that were based on all these different things. Then through recruitment we did it I mean every aspect everything you can imagine. From video games from music. From leaflets to podcast I think the national socialist movement now even today has probably five podcasts a week- which- to video games in the last few years. Hello all kinds of different. Basically. To combat these type things what we need to do is. Some no bill. And you saw those things because once people get all in this and I keep saying I don't like to. Cult but in a lot of ways it is like a call because you are you living life in sort of a bubble. And you don't see outside that bubble life is so much different from me now because I'm outside a bubble like it's like a whole new life. Group of human beings like when you were in the movement. You are in your mind is closed- many different things. I was I was top story on the way over here. Another guy that had gotten item is a year before I didn't. You know my sound crazy to be. When I holding for first. Look around where that is the another race we talked I see that today and I think. That's the time. Was that we had a most. That is the. It's just only battle just like a small act of kindness that normal right you know I didn't see it was things. My. I want to draw off my experience improvement and doing now. Here I believe. And I know a lot of hello. That sort of thing speak this sort of thing is pretty easy. In the movement when you leave your hair like originally I just retired from the movement that's that's easy you can retire. No big deal. When you start speaking out and do this sort of. They look at that as if you are the worst kind of. The worst kind of in the tool bar. When I dropped my experience my knowledge movement. How they think the psychology of that why they do what do to combat this. And to help this is my way of giving back- for a lot of people that question sincerity. Why am why I'm doing this sort of thing. We put for me or mental state I was that I knew what I was doing. In in this world in a sense of how to do the work business tied in with this every I knew. Because this was. I was doing for all those years was on I knew was wrong to go. But I get out. Why. Because it was easy a stock- like a guy that that's working at a terror that he hates everyday and just keeps doing doing in. I'm not. That I'm ashamed to say it but it's true. It will be easier to stay where I was at why I didn't stay any longer is like. That was coming violence that was already happening and the violence that's to calm if we don't. Come back there in the correct manner. And drop. My experience at this when I talk to you station. In this way state and that that's a one I didn't even know number years ago. Like this and having a conversation trying to- expound the- ideology I'm assuming of the movement. He was knocked out on the street and people were laughing and they filmed it and kind of walking over him I think people might have been spitting on him and filming it nobody help this young man. So at the time when I was in the movement and we use videos like this all the time to you know. Promote our cause and save like what we were doing was right. When I join the movement I thought I was doing what was right I thought I was standing up for my people. And that's what a lot of the people that are involved in that their idealists. They believe they're standing up for their people that's why this is going to be a hard thing to break. They're not joining a because they just blindly hate. Me there is those types in there too. But I'm saying for me personally and for a lot of the people that I knew. It was about ideology it was about. Trying to save the white race as we reckon and some of the other panelists of kind of- touch upon here the thinking of these guys- in that. So under the de humanization subject. Gene this young man treated like that in a lot of people don't. Gosh why. Steal so for the for this guide I got knocked out in the street. Because at the time. Minimization of I. But now since. I see that wow. A white person when they couldn't see the teaching in a the de humanization of so many others. You see not that we- didn't come to me until out. Until after I had time to. Decompress my mind in fiscally look back and go wow you know I could see the human is a of this guy. The structure that I didn't. Being somewhat that propagated hate and- intolerance and all this sort of thing for all these years I didn't see that did you realization of all those other people. See it now. That's why I feel like there's hope. For all of us if we can. Hey. In the photo on the left. A rally that's me there's being with. Yes ma'am. Other groups that. Thank you thousands. On right. Marla by default. Yeah that's. It's a it's a psych hate reading violent. Island see a Peavey is as one of things I work with now- which profit called networks that happens people leave of various forms of extreme some extremism can come in many forms- is not just the far right. The far left is up here- G. hot of mints and other types of extremism. We see it whether it's gang members or or- all the different kinds of extremism anti far far right jihadi a Muslim extremist. Types of extremists- when they leave wrong period. So I'm this this is what I should had up here okay we have. It may be item we've that basis for it Bob in sum up. Any yeah okay others may find some I know that. Okay on the right today but felt it is important to point out the other forms of extreme because they are all up dangerous. Polarization. Stream question understanding hi. I know that hard pill to swallow. But if. One of one of the most of it is that that I've seen getting a number of other people are. With you when I. And I've brought people a few from other position if you were independence and people from the group and I always keep my- two of those. As I know we can reach a lot of this bill that are never going to. Virtually no matter if someone were for me tenure ago I probably wouldnt of. Left either- but we have to understand that be compassion and understanding. Does that make not everybody can but I know I know that that's not even possible for a lot of people. But you have to understand and this is this is why I'm here today to explain how this works and how they think and how they feel. Extremists feel isolated. There increased isolation will only further radicalized them. As I mentioned about simply holding a door for somebody of another race. The movement there's people won't even go to ethnic restaurant they won't go in see certain movies they won't- they won't even talk to somebody about the race or or- after. You know so these people are ready self. Self isolated so it's very hard to reach people like that so a lot of times simply breaking through that polarization and getting them to understand- that what that your human being too I mean this is a lot of. A lot of the ways it broke it down for me it was originally I'm from Minnesota and I moved to Detroit in Detroit the whites are a minority I had I was forced basically to deal with. People of all. On a daily basis for many many so many wonderful people from all different racial backgrounds and started during their store wow this person's family is no different than mine this person had the same struggles but I do and- listing is that sound when you're in this. Cult like environment or in this bubble Utah. Beyond that you don't see that Solana times simply humanizing the person sitting across from you and getting them out of that isolation treating them with compassion and kindness- really works a friend of mine. Of Daryl Davis is a black guy that goes in its hands clamped meetings and befriends Klansman and a lot of people think general's absolutely crazy I told when I first minimized you are crazy. But what he does works because he'll sit back home. All those stereo types. And fire coming out bodies. Because we all have commonalities with differences. Frances are so much less. Than the common at these in the similarity between all the people of different races. But it was harder before you see so we can do that as a as a come. People as human beings we're gonna get somewhat. He you know. Thinking in this this movie disengage. Medicalization if you come up to these people and you you in their face and this is what I know thanks to the anti for because anti. Six seven. Ever. Balloons attacking people cannot see face all these kind of things they don't work I've been through that and I you. Every once tactics work if you. Hey how's. In the face really hard for you to get punched in the face gonna fight back in you can get the radicalized usually those kind of tactics further radicalized individual drive into that space that you're trying to get them out of. And an attack it that way that in my mind in from my experience as the best way attacking violence with violence. Not a word. Meeting hate with hate it's not work. Ms and solutions and now this is said to talk about today. Thanks also. Working together. That all of us together aberration act I make on this for. But former ext as well as from far right for. The move and that thing because I understand how they think what bottom their college prep call it whatever you want but we do understand caller but we don't have a chance. Some of the academics of. All together we can provide the kind of support. It takes to get these people out of. And I want to say like. Similar one email that left him after. You know what we need to have a program. And I said what do you say your alcohol like and- you know what I mean we need to have a support group because they're saying like she was saying in this is true for just about everybody you've lost all your friends you've lost your support network. You've lost most of the people you know some of these people don't have strong family support networks so everyone they knew everyone around them. What's in that bubble. And now that they're out of it. They don't have anybody so. It's very important. That there's programs in place to try to help these people. So for some it might be further any patient AB placement. Meaning programs get a model. The St immersion pro. This a little bit like I was talking about immersion programs would be something that works hand in hand with community and I'll reach leaders whether its mosques synagogues community centers churches things like that all in tears and people from all different aspects walks a life. You take somebody from the men and- in person. I'm or one experience I can draw upon was I was in a movie called- white right the filmmakers DHEA con. Con is an activist from the left. From these most long from them. The end. People in an SL and other organise and this woman's hi in compassion reached. And ting them touch them in a lot of different ways she spent to them like so you want to throw me out of this country would you which throw me up again and- one of the- unanswered Adderley couldn't answer. It in. Them to the car because the night. Is asking the question that was unsettling. Broke down the bear and some of the people that were in that fit là. People have persevered and done that sort of thing and for her she was a victim she was a victim of white supremacy- I won't get into her story of because that's not for me to tell but she was a victim so it takes. His own president at amount of compassion to be able to do things like that it reminds me of another woman not hope Haidar that works with us that parallel networks. Hope's father was and- and hope is a black woman her father was murdered by a white supremacist. And hope is probably one of the most forgiving people. She is the kind of forgiveness that I don't think I could ever have or that most people could ever have she attends the parole hearings for the guy that killed our father. She's been able to forgive and try to understand that that sort of thing so I think forgiveness is a powerful powerful tool- and I'm not suggesting we go to the level that hope was able to go to but that's one of the things we do with parallel networks as we work with. Former jihadis former white nationalists victims of hate that sort of thing along with academics. And get everybody to work together and build this not community because we need to replace wife parallel networks is because we're trying to replace. What they have lost you know building new network for the people to have something. Up positive in their life. And actually today. Our control alt delete hate magazine this is something we're gonna be in Sir tell them print issue. I had hoped brings with but it low. The press today the map in that we've produced to break down these sort of things and to get it into the people's hands so we can break down hate it's written completely by farmers- victims of hate and academics in in these roles. Fifty extremist let's help from these programs. I'm to come in this in the future. I would suggest make. Ms mandates. Sure. Because that will break down the state's type old birds so we going to do it someone has a crack addiction problem. And you go okay well you way for I think there's a handful of money in a new part. In the old. Is in place you can't just say what this and get this person I've got out so. Problem solved is done no a lot need long term counseling they need at new network the need a port group or they could go back. And that's what we're trying to avoid. Having someone say on. And then going right back into the previous. Is something that's healthy or or if and when you do that is well making the immersion program. Mandatory I think would be a pop. Does it will show them at these other human. And they may have I stated themselves when they were in the nationalist movement- but meet with these volunteers. That help in this type of thing I would make a difference I really do. When the former's have a critical role in this because of our under ending on reach these people are law you know my number down form. I somewhat lot of people don't realize. There's one guy said to me says. Good thing the move brought. All the in all the years you were in it has brought blood sweat and tears. It's not a good thing is law negativity it's a lot of it it's a rough life it's not a good if. And. They don't they don't even realize it's like being lost tunnel and not understanding what you've really lost and then come out and you see like. It is like the kid they can't see any gets new glasses or contacts I was a kid by the way. Dot. You know that's like when you finally see like what you've been missing. Change is possible. This today. To be able to do something like this check pots. Real change. Born this learn the can on learned. Jamie. I mean these people Tackett people not gonna help when it is there causation. This past the wait. I believe that most. Less perfect we all think we're ashamed of. A bad thing. Yeah and I think for everybody the dad Todd redemption as well typically yes. That's all today my presentation I'd like to thank everybody. Getting us in in some de L. information about background to and- what you've experienced in your and in your life- we're going to move out to- quick comments and I'd like to give my colleagues an opportunity if they have any questions but if you don't mind I'd like to kick that off asked- ask you- two questions one is- was there was there- you have to name names but was there an individual or an organization. That approached you that- and did you suddenly clock- or did it take some time and then- you mention peril. Networks and I don't imagine that the only group out there. Do you know how organizations that are funded- and who who sponsors them. Let me do one question the time yeah the first the first part was. What's your sub was there a an individual or an organization that- reached out to you and- it clicked suddenly or to take some time this was something that took me about three years about three years and was meeting a number of individuals over that period of years- and sort of breaking it down so for me I wasn't really approached until I was. Starting to get out- in the past year that I was in. I approach parallel networks I had some contact with some other people and- they started talking to me about getting out. So yes there is other far as how the group performed that works as a non profit so we depend on. I don't really know how it all works yet because new inner. Soul I think you probably know more about it than I do as far as how aye aye what you told me tonight. And I want to thank you. But I do know that- these are things that. Seriously need funding I don't know how how the funding exactly works I'm sure some of Michael- coworkers and peril on that works understand. That there's other organizations such as life after hate is another one- there's a few debt. Is a few different groups that do this work but it's. How they get the full thing and all but I'm too new to it to really be able to tell you how they how they get some of it does come from the private sector- I know there was some grants that were supposed to be going to life after hate at some point. But. I don't think that happened. So yeah thank you questions. All right there. Any forms filled out. The one to bring those to happen and- call people up. Yes good thank you and- want to submit a slip now too late- Danny during. If you could come and speak to the my phone. That would be great. Well thank you for being. For the purpose because of two comments. And one question but I want to thank all of elected or. Hearing my group list. There is the job thank you so much for being here but because you don't. Really great I'm the. Third grant with the California over his office through classroom you're going to meet Mike the next week one I think was of course eleven. A very dear friend. Also protecting. It speech and he was I. In riverside. Bob. Does he want to make sure that the defense. The right to speak. Was Brian Levin your friend and it was also should direct. More things shooting of seven do you know the person who shoppers what's your. Another students was going by the FBI. Yeah disappeared want to focus on to join his group so I know it's percent. With this I wanted to ask one question and make to come. View was. The of based it. Or hate speech to the lives. A close one. Many times a year I have over four thousand students sampling four thousand your interview. And the sad part of it. Percent of Muslims reported hate speech against them. Reported to you was- so thank you so much for coming here. Do you before I'm going to do is. You want before you nine hundred or maybe four thousand names of people on a daily basis or weekly basis experiencing hate speech. The with his. Eyes risk because we don't know what to do with that it doesn't look. Yeah the T. facing but I'm also the other one these are are expected the other thing is another one of my political. For more senior. This is the only. Version talked about it was the largest immersion pro western United States the best one data brought over a dollar grant. For the six people working through the immersion program to go above three. It is and of course officials in the room. The question to you Sir but I hope oversee which is in this room. We'll bring it because they know it. What it is to bring it back. Lives. And we brought them all one religion. The city is them. This to be good so the question user what we do one we have thought of people reporting. In his crimes against them what you want to do as instructed first come to the students. Thank you for your comment thank you for your question. I would say this if you feel that there when it comes so I hate speech. I fight hate with hate. In a negative way is the answer. Point. Responding is isn't he said you have to love. Try to befriend try to understand intro compassion. I would say for the individuals who are victims of hate crimes you have to port crimes there's way that we can even combat those. In our we need we are Daly facing and pulls are really the voiceless because there are. Sir political. In the in the Hispanic or Latino community were find are afraid to come forward because the rate of the repercussions of. Partition were being again. Freight the middle to end this is goes the most to me also- individuals are afraid because it will be targeted. Hello this man is that Mr. Everyone in the voiceless. It's not our job to pick a side of the one side I Republican press our job right. That we live. Hey in courage that report the crime. At the ranch read in a place. And we can figure. Let me add another suggestion because in some thing is to as prevalent. I have no doubt that it that it it. A you know a survey is a good way of trying to- assessed and then show the- extent to which an issue a exists in a community whether it's a college community or city or neighborhood. And so you may want to look at developing a way to. Seve that kind of information and categorizing it in a way that is separate and apart from the criminal justice system. Just some good news real quick our our leave our lead story showed thank god last year anti Muslim cry finally went down found that to. Twenty seven even. Anti assault Muslim still was higher than that hello anti Arab crimes unfortunately with seen something he's twenty seventeen to. But hope god was on their figure it will come Kerr's data and our data showing a decline at the mother I'm twenty eighteen I of course it's always to scan number come down but what we're looking for our long term trend lines were continuously goes down and doesn't bounce around a high number. Our next to a comment from a night out Lawrence. I I'm in Iran and first of our most I enjoy this. And I Philip this conversation kids in to continue on like. Hopefully we can have some more change in the future so. Although we went through the hate crimes and everything like that. Did not go over was white privilege that I went gov. So I exam what I put. Many people though it exist and so one example of my privileges the fact that we have. Former White soliciting here that is for you to be. The all around too pretty much. Take to in a way cool and so. Sample of our crews with use with how. Anybody know to mayor rice. So even more examples I keep is of an armed boys and on our black men who were killed by police I want used to be a rice. Temple and so the fact that. By the bees. Again and we had a nineteen year old white by the name of Nicholas crews who went into a squirrel and murdered seventeen people and so nineteen year old boy walked out alive breeding and everything apps for a twelve year old black boy who had a toy gun was gunned down so that their- love why approved. And I want. Rainy days and that's something that we on is talk about more thank you. Thank you very much. One of the reasons. That there's more than the average security areas that were I'm concerned. Outside folks might want to take advantage of the fact that we're talking about this very sensitive topic Bob says more than the usual more than the common amount of security for a select committee or for. Any committee even in that in the in the capital but that's large they're here- but thank you for. In that up. Next we have just in case. Close short good evening does us all sat down I want to commend you guys on this event that you guys put together for like it's very necessary for us to talk about this all want to thank all you guys on the panel. First and foremost- but I sat there long and hard thinking about a question a housing company and ask. En I mean although I can come down here and- of the things that. I wanted to touch on is one of things that. Even to is. You can't fight hate with hate you guys. Touched on that. Earlier but to me. Of what do you suppose that. People of non color when you have these. All right movements these national groups and they're coming down in your cities and their come down here and what do you. Are you not supposed. Not supposed to fix anything or to do anything and then finally start to speak up in a- manner you get shut down and send away. IT so how do you expect. Us as a people of color to dance progress in America. We quite frankly were allowed to a lot of us come from brown's were were already fighting a system that isn't built for us in America the first place. So we do have these. Groups come that you say and you tell us. It's not gets a fight hate with hate but what if but what what has sitting around goddess all these years. Where where has that got us look look up. One you guys as a pan. The answer that what. As a people can we do to combat this that. You run for office you get college degree vote. The court ruled time to time. I know that there is a movement of people. Stand with. It's bigger than you think the loudest most of voices of hate. I'm sure have one and I can tell you that the person who made me going to do. Bottom. He was a segregated school and living in an attic and he went to the dean and the dean said would separate putting. You in will record. He read. You do. Assemblymember midday. I can add something to that. First when it comes to fighting hate sound are pro testing thing. In itself is something that I'm sure Jeff will attempt to they they knew that they expected that they would up would not. Hundred counter protesters show up who do you think got arrested. Testers because usually anger lead to violence which to the rest that do anybody any good all it does is get the **** in the class white I'm assist. So that's terminate those rallies. I and knowing what and so there are there are other ways to pressure concerns now we have so to media where you can go online and calmly discuss this is Jeff said maybe you try to make friends with somebody maybe not one of those right. Please or or something else. The negativity that comes. Of some of those same does not do any of any it only benefits the extra. To respond to a young people thank you. I marks Ted then I am happy to be here and encourage. All folks to stand. But it needs and I agree the young people us. To it hi it happens because we do live. Lee in a races IT this is Susan permeates of our ours we see it everywhere see it everywhere we see it. We see an institution. Unfortunately we continue to see it. There is spectrum. Eight and we are looking at right now you know the most a strong arm of hate. You can go. When I read today you know someone CA are. Of color in line perhaps in the first class and asking. The right. Where we see in rivers. Next may by the conduct. Of the metro train another pop school. Going do you wanna. In the group it up the girl stood up. Tape those remarks. She then came to my office I. At the metrolink resident a to come to. We had a meet. You know by videotaping and she got it on the news so I think it's incumbent upon us to every single time we see some infringe upon. Question whether we belong on or not. Certain places stand. Do it fully. But is but we need to stand up. Know what to say to you when- we have these rallies and there were fighting and things like that the people in the movement based on that absolutely thrives on it so when there was violence they could get a chance to fight. Remember rally was in. And the police. Kiley for nothing. The. Out there to hear it you know like they say like el we've got free speech in this country but you're speaking and nobody hears it you know like a tree falling press no one hears it I can see that on all the route is I ever doing past twenty seven years that route the city where there was hardly any be there but- press it was the most demoralizing from the standpoint of all. Right now the list. Ever been at whereas store. We have fistfight. And the battles in like that eyes let me I need to do that again. You know we can we have that this work. Was boring. So it's like we don't feed into that because I. Think it's- out of the movement I think. It keeps people there if there's- a peaceful protest. Since but I got like to salute. Complete warrant for to test. Islands then it just blows up the water. I want to tell you. So proud of having the. I think change happen because of you. The way use those of us who live in have expected so many different things our reaction was different and the dead. About what would you all do. Excited that day. You you hold us to tell you talk about privilege we have to talk about that because that is important. Don't in in the room. No pun intended. Those are the sorts of things we have to talk about and knowing young. Is that are that are getting grease to becoming the judges that are becoming the elected officials things are going to change because of you. They're going to change because of you not in spite of you but because of you. I thank you for being here. The each of these questions and- general topics are that taught the subject of a course. They are they are exercise does. But I think. If you don't mind my. Calling you by first name. Bob on compassion of so you can confront and be compassionate. And I do think that we have to confront. Race I'm sorry some anti some Islamophobia Walker said. But then what fall. What fall those are saying that's not acceptable. That's were I'm where what we heard from if- gives me some hope and some ideas since fought about where you might go from here which to me for this fall. A series of select. Committee hearings this kind of struggle it's- takes a lot work to put together an event like this but we're- with that we do be a friend you know it's all great to sit here. And here information but what we do and information how do we move forward and way that's positive and helps change the world- thank you for the question. I we've cut- still have a few of these will try to move this along we've got- because- it's now six oh four. And we're gonna Ernest. But let's let's keep this going Sherri Gilliam. Followed by Nicholas first. Your call two names the time if you can read it is might walk. I have two older than most people here I combined what what I don't want to. Be on that- there's a twenty five million. The state okay three hundred twenty million when I see the white supremacists- rally have hand four hundred when I have staff people give me three thirteen. Eighteen twenty two yeah thirty seven fifty. When I look the police shooting the mails black people whatever hundred twenty five hundred this is all the other night. But the same time look this room seven hundred people living here. Time six that's how many people get killed the Chicago Bulls. Eight thousand in here black kids are killing each other the inner cities. We do not have a white problem what we have is a violence problem. And it's fine for you guys. I sit here I do except talk only as I go for centuries in thirty minutes ever so I want to try to. Help our kids especially yep avail yourself more information if somebody give your percentage. Don't percentage look number. It is unacceptable what's on our communities and trying to blame it on whites. A prince or hate I grew up in the fifties and sixties and the fact. Had real hatred and real racism. Lynchings shootings you can go to school with certain people I was blessed you can go to certain bathrooms my dad mom in up in Florida the legion capital of the world they have some Hollister second change. Would really change your mind and with that being said at that point there was thousand people that were steps whatever you can barely community without fear of some Appalachian are killing you and there was no loss protect them. We have grown pass at one I wonder when they come a day when I look the kids hear what they're saying. And my main. I have to assn who's bothered you. Most you gotta be good luck unless you live in inner cities. You can one go to school when you want. It restaurants where you want you know use a bathroom where you want. Who these people that our body is so bad on you we don't have a the space. This can happen allow that in a certain way you acted when you get out of anything at any point could cost you your life if stepped on a line. Okay my dad and his friends now and then eighties and nineties. If you ever watch barbershop. Them near the happiest in a women I've ever seen let me talk I said how do they have that. In their heart much hatred. Racism what directed toward them what they had morning thing they have strong families and relationships what we don't have anymore. I want you to challenge your professors what they say Ste do you. And they table assists six go the library get your group together get you some books I feel two books and go to that social media Tweedy and Facebook and all that kind of. Garbage values. Get real information at ask your professor questions. When they pay you fifty set up. Born you look at that the percent maybe two people. That is. Not right for them to do that and give you that false answer and what they know is most. He is not a you know read study. You have no idea what what they're saying with the top. What information out there go also to your history you're not being taught history more. And how black people really. And what how you were treated whatever but challenge them. To do it challenge yourself what you're doing education is fine keep that. Up is that with an argument we're so far removed from the slave ship. A lot you have idea. What they were slaves. At one point so I don't have a problem when you see it what's going to rights that white supremacy which three of four people. Is that how my Charlotte. Top of Chicago. This room is about a hundred chair so in. Time that sticks. That's me black kids are killing each other in just a cog. Eight thousand every year. And I'm sorry about these people. That are on this board I see they these nice look cushy areas some you don't whatever but they did that the oldest but you'll get them. Ladies be and go home. Lackey is Betty we don't yeah. Don't live like that. So get your education can. Get more in your community find was going on share your professors and they don't want to debate me in my little. Girls and stuff to get this be a cold different coverage will do that all of the caliphs. But we need to have some under discussion and not just people just you know famous. Things whatever have debate between two groups. Leaving give you real information so you're going to be informed but I love you guys I'm older. I want you guys really that flourished your education. I want you to. Make decisions on the form information. And continuous original question. But I just felt. Hard I had to say that thank you very much. The perspective. The flowers all by Randall. Días. Hello hello I'm so first say thank you for a actually taking I'm just as because I'm not be with that resistance I'll take the time to I was the only college. Here but a big amount of us are college students. Take the time to talk to us our boat I really wanted to was for the- to German at the end- I know you said combating hate with hate I do agree with that that's not okay- but- how as group that as me growing up in inner city. Are identifying as a white male and- female- to be hated Bob why cited from because my father's black. How do we go against. Will win like for instance the black lives matter. Is only after that they became notices fixing offices that are wrong. But then came a blue lives matter movie and a white lies about a movie and a- large management. That's basically the says kind of covering up the sins of the- shop. If you take it apart like people. So the end and I respect what you with the lady I said I was that bad indeed. Are we still have like black males I know from a from Bigelow California for me California- I've had multiple of my friends be gunned down by police officers. Whether that be whether that be for no apparent reason or for some reason at all. It is still wrong. The fact that I'm I'm dropped in my home city and if I get bored over an officer tells me. That the reason why he pulled me over is because I. Look like I belong in a certain area. Is absolutely wrong. So it and I do want to commend you for Stephanie Stephanie. Into the spaces- because it is hard for somebody who's- who's hated black people come here talk. In a little black people about why. Roth so I do commend you on that but in a day I don't know like what like what it. Does to do as as you. Are always not heard. Of it basis. When we got people base. There are protests. Okay thank you for your state your comment. On this question I can only answer. Number one I am African American to almost of what. Number three I'm also. So the question. The same questions. Have an address the officer one it is unacceptable for an officer approach somebody say you like you don't. We don't teach it. That's an internal. Once it's not recommended there to know a lot about being out of. The result this is. I want. No word three does violence published anything ever. Every great leader accomplished accomplice. It's never ever is listen ever in any way. Any land. Everyone has the right to test. Jeff said. Organizations a form and they want to get together one response because they know they're going to get a response if not there. Who were. Protesting they're talking to themselves. When it comes to. Thirty I'm sorry. Yes against protests. It there's nothing wrong with protests we are at this point where we are in this nation you have indeed who do not look like you in positions that would. Have been. Forty fifty six years ago. At all the- I'm fortunate. Sir because there was a time that somebody look like me was not a law enforcement officer it just wasn't I'm for it because we have individuals who are status. Members. Nor would not look like you are aye. For it is the what. This single life matters when the numbers of statistics when they come out it's not popular to say that is the test. Police officers search more white Americans. It's not it's not popular about that you can have a shooting somewhere in our nation the media is only gonna show one aspect. They will show on others. Sir. All I will also tell you this everything was shooting every in every every incident. Late you have to look at. Independently it's not all down in the- it happened within in the word. Or New York or Florida or county San Marino. You can't love everything the same. All protest. Because what at the other day every does matter if. Bill especially he is more. We're off to my department in our jail. The certain sees before we have more calling from. Bernard job duties all the more officers but we don't talk about that. Life is a life and it doesn't. It is a thousand watt told or one life a mother fears of every race. Is still hurting. Thank you for the answer. The cut off but we were given the room until fifteen. The court also. A major. We had Randall and state keener- but wanted to- op questions or comments I pledges have ask your brief as possible but we do want. Okay. Users about- then in a or whatever believe that but. Time we said it seems like we get our hands. And we put that the police officers at the we get shot. Free. Stand up and others have when I get this so. And it's possible to answer that question hopefully but assembly member may give it away I think. The deserves an answer and I appreciate you asking and so on I am proud to be a co author of assembly bill three ninety two the use of force I am Cooper co author of that bill. That was signed by the governor this year. Changing the law. How police should act been deadly use of force so I'm high school teacher top with ms movie share here my students were stopped had said that on the curb you know because they were in the wrong place and they were the wrong color so I respect. Your quest. I know what we're talking about here has a you know we could talk about it- for many more hours. I think Skinner questions. Assembly. Trying to address the issue that you bring up. Thank you. The last we have sage keener. Hello I'm sage Greiner two questions I'm sorry I know it's gonna be a little shorter- once reject that- throughout your prison he referred to the national socialist movement as Martin these organs and what. Is the frequently a man I can I have a question rather rather as saying this the organ is once a part of- is a particular reason why you. Said that. Or is any reason behind it. That's a good question now it force I haven't. Times are when I'm Madera creek say my former organization. Very very clear. It is my former realization I have nothing to do with the organisers. Thank you I'll be more mindful thank you. And my sense is first after. You had said but of what they're not another. He crimes that happen. But for being honest and- respect all enforcement. Is there project and while there's no urgency. AB props there's reasons with- but they have not mother the rest is it as we- as a society. That is pushed aside more times and often. It's not just for your notes. But I can. When. The call for service they need right now. Our. We anything unless somebody reported so that's the first set to report it. I don't have an answer we would not want to report something. Right. And that's the best thing I can say. Just real for the first. Your of justice statistics three years fifty four now report we what do you poor. To report to the police or. Organizations can report you I'm gonna be working friends with the Mexican consulate so we can get people to read and which one think is Latino serving institution we need to reach the Latino community our numbers consistently show that the reporting among Latinos does not appear to register with portion the population so what we're gonna.
