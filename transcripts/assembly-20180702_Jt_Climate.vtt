AS YOU KNOW THIS SHIFT IS FAR

00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:28.033
MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST SWAPPING

OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.302
SMALLER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:05.670
HAVE BEGAN REPORTING THAT THEY

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:06.771

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:11.843
CAPACITY.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:12.911
THIS IS MAGNIFIED BY THE FACT

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:14.712
THAT CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:16.247
A PROLIFERATION OF THE NUMBER

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.815

TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEY NOW

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:35.266
SERVE A COMBINED 15% OF THE LOAD

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.368
UNDER OUR JURISDICTION.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:39.204
AS A RESULT LAST MONTH.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.438
THE COMMISSION MADE TWO MAJOR

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.339
CHANGES TO THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:42.707
PROGRAM.

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.642
FIRST LOAD SERVING ENTITIES WILL

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.377
BE SUBJECT TO A THREE TO FIVE

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:47.812

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:49.080
LOCAL AREAS.

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.548
WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT EXTENSION

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:53.618
OF THEIR PRESENT OBLIGATIONS.

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:55.019
IN ADDITION WE ASK OUR LOAD

00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:56.521
SERVING ENTITIES TO PROPOSE A

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:57.989
CENTRAL BUYER STRUCTURE FOR

00:30:58.056 --> 00:31:00.725
CAPACITY IN LOCAL AREAS.

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:03.127
THE CENTRAL FIRE STRUCTURE IS A

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:05.163
HISTORICALLY PROVEN APPROACH.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.931
THAT WE HOPE WILL ADDRESS LOAD

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:08.166
MIGRATION AND COST.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.968
SHIFTING ISSUES WHILE ENSURING

00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:13.304
CHAIRMAN.

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.173
WE THINK THESE POLICY MOVES HAVE

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.874
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:18.243
OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE SEEN AS

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:19.877
THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES HAVE

00:31:19.944 --> 00:31:21.512
BEEN ATTEMPTING.

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:23.181
TO PROCURE THEIR RESOURCE

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:26.584
ADEQUACY OBLIGATIONS.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.819
BUT ULTIMATELY IF WE'RE GONNA

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:29.087
MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:30.922
REDUCTION GOALS IN THE LONG TERM.

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:32.223
WE NEED TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.691
ON THE FAUCET FLEET.

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.727
BEING SUCCESSFUL IN THAT TASK IS

00:31:35.793 --> 00:31:36.995
GOING TO REQUIRE A BROAD SUITE

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:38.763
OF SOLUTIONS.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.398
INCLUDING ADDING MORE UTILITY

INCLUDING THROUGH

00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:59.651
REGIONALIZATION.

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:01.686
I WILL NOTE THAT IN THE EXAMPLE

IT'S BUNDLED COMES INTO OUR

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:12.996
STATE DO WE KNOW IT TELL US WHAT

00:47:13.063 --> 00:47:15.866
THAT REPRESENTS THAT PROCESS AND

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:18.402
ARE WE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH WHAT

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:19.836
WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING ARE WE

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.305
GETTING WERE NOBLES ARE WE

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:22.139
GETTING.

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:23.674
COMBINATION RENEWABLES AND

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.709
FOSSIL FUEL MORE FOSSIL FUEL

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.211
THAN KNOWS WHAT WAS THAT PROCESS

00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:29.580
LOOK LIKE.

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:30.747
SO -- AT

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:33.684
BREAK UP THAT THAT THE RESPONSES --

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.152
FOR NON ENERGY IMBALANCE AS

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:38.622
ACTION -- WE

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.123
REALLY DON'T HAVE A CLEAR

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.960
INDICATION WHAT IS BEHIND.

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:44.928
THE SOURCE OF ENERGY WE HAVE TO

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:47.030
RELY ON ON WHAT'S CALLED TAG

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:49.099
INFORMATION AND THAT MAKE --

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:50.934
FEED INTO.

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:52.236
SOME OF THE SOURCE SPECIFIC

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:53.737
INFORMATION SPECIFIED RESOURCE

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.039
INFORMATION THAT CALIFORNIA

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:57.774
RESOURCES BOARD HAS KNOWN FOR

00:47:57.841 --> 00:48:01.044
ITS ACCOUNTING --

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:02.579
THAT FOR THE UNSPECIFIED

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:03.981
RESOURCES THEY DON'T THEY DON'T

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:06.116
SPECIFY ON WE REALLY DON'T KNOW

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:09.286
WHAT'S BEHIND THAT ENERGY.

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.120
UNDER THE ENERGY IMBALANCE

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:12.089
MARKET AND POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:13.223
FOR REGIONALIZATION WE WOULD

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.026
ACTUALLY DO MORE SOURCE SPECIFIC --

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.961
TRACKING AN ACCOUNTING OF THOSE

00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:20.063
DISPATCHES OF EXTERNAL RESOURCES

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.765
TO SERVE LOW IN CALIFORNIA.

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.066
AND WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:24.801
WE ACTUALLY DO A RESOURCE

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.870
SPECIFIC DISPATCH RATHER THAN

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:29.573
JUST GET ON IMPORTED ENERGY THAT

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.075
IS REALLY UNSPECIFIED AND ON

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:33.410
TYPE NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:35.812
RESOURCE --

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:36.913
SO THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.449
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IF YOU --

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:41.685
DO MORE EXTERNAL RESOURCE

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.787
SPECIFIC DISPATCH UNDER EM OR

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:49.526
UNDER REGIONALIZATION.

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.629
I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT --

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:53.864
SO THE QUESTION SO YEAR WERE

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.999
IMPORTED ENERGY SAID IT WAS 35%

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:59.603
AND THEN YOU SAID 88% MAKE WHAT --

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.438
BUT THE QUESTION FOR IMPORTING

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.506
AYE BECAUSE THAT.

00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:04.775
I REMEMBER VISITING CAL I SO AND

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.143
I WAS TOLD [inaudible]

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:08.078
AT TIMES.

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:09.980
WE HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY WE DON'T

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.148
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH.

00:49:11.214 --> 00:49:12.649
SO CAN YOU HELP.

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:14.017
FILL IN THAT GAP BECAUSE YOU

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.118
KNOW I ALWAYS SEE THE STOCK

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:16.253
CURVED EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THE

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.454
DUCK CURVE.

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:19.056
NOW WE OVER PRODUCING CALIFORNIA

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:20.290
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:22.426
SOLAR AND NOW YOU --

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:23.260
THERE'S TESTIMONY ABOUT

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:26.296
IMPORTING ENERGY.

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:28.432
OVERALL OVER THE YEAR --

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.200
WE ARE -- A

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:32.169
NET IMPORTER OF ENERGY.

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:34.171
THERE ARE TIMES INCREASING

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:35.939
PERIODS OF TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:38.041
DAY WHERE WE HAVE --

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:39.209
EXCESS AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAN

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.845
WHAT WE NEED TO SERVE OUR LOW.

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:43.213
AND IT'S ACTUALLY THIS YEAR THAT

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.115
WE STARTED TO SEE PERIODS OF

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:46.883
TIME WHERE WE'RE DOING WE'RE

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.518
OBSERVING NET EXPORTS.

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.354
OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA IS SO WE

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.789
HAVE NOT SEEN THAT BEFORE --

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:55.992
THE YET OVER THE ENTIRE YEAR --

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:57.761
IF YOU IMAGINE THE DOCKER --

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.796
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN WE

00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:00.097
[inaudible]

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:03.934
LONG ON PORTS TO STILL BOUNCE

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.936
THE A LOW DURING THOSE THAT

00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:08.572
EVENING LOW POLL --

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:10.273
ENDED ABOUT WE SEE ENCOURAGED

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.809
TIME WHERE ABOUT HALF THAT RAMP

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:16.046
IS BEING MANAGED THROUGH IMPORTS

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:17.748
OF ENERGY --

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:20.250
AS OPPOSED TO INTERNAL RESOURCES

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:21.184
AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WE'RE

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.753
ACTUALLY GETTING AN EXTERNAL

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:24.688
ENERGY SOME OF THAT MAYBE HYDRO --

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:26.823
RESOURCES AND IT REDUCING OUR

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.625
RELIANCE ON INTERNAL GAS

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:29.593
RESOURCES THAT COULD BE

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:30.660
ADMITTING RESOURCES IN

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:32.095
CALIFORNIA.

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:34.398
BUT THE POINT IS THAT OVER THE

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.433
OVER THE YEAR WE'RE STILL SING

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.635
ABOUT AS MISTER COREY INDICATED

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.704
ABOUT 30% OF OUR TOTAL.

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:44.841
LOAD IS BEING MET BY OUR IMPORTS --

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:45.976
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT PARTICULAR

00:50:46.042 --> 00:50:48.645
TIMES THAT DECREASES TO NEAR

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.580
ZERO AND AS I INDICATED --

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:51.615
ACTUALLY NET EXPORTING NOW

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:53.550
APPEAR IT'S TIME CUT SO WE HAVE

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.752
THAT EXPORTS WE IMPORT ENERGY

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.220
BUT OF THE ENERGY THAT WE IMPORT

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:58.722
WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THE

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:01.291
GHG LEVELS ARE WE YOU.

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:02.159
YOU GUYS DO AN ESTIMATE THAT'S

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:03.860
CORRECT.

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:04.795
THAT WOULD PUT THAT'S WHAT I

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:07.898
UNDERSTOOD FROM TESTIMONY.

00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:09.499
I THINK AS WAS CORY NICATOR --

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:11.268
WHERE THERE IS SPECIFIED

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:13.437
RESOURCES OTHER ABLE TO ACCOUNT

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:15.739
THE FOR THAT GHG ASSOCIATED WITH

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:17.174
THOSE SPECIFIC RESOURCES?

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.976
I THINK THE 8% INDICATED WAS THE

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:22.245
AMOUNT OF UNSPECIFIED RESOURCE

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:23.847
THAN IMPORTED ENERGY.

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.081
THOUGHT AND JUST FROM A POLICY

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.416
RESPERS BECTIVE I'M JUST TRYING

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:27.684
TO UNDERSTAND.

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:29.719
IS IT BETTER TO IMPORT THIS

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.188
ENERGY WORLD WE DON'T KNOW

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.423
EXACTLY WHAT THE GHG LEVELS ARE

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:34.624
AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE.

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:36.326
KEEPING SUBSYSTEMS ONLINE THAT

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:38.228
WE DO HAVE IN STATE THAT WE SHUT

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.629
DOWN -- FOR

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:40.797
INSTANCE LIKE BIOMASS WITHERS

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:43.166
GEOTHERMAL.

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:45.435
AS GEOTHERMAL FACILITIES.

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:46.570
IS IT BETTER TO KEEP IN

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:47.704
CALIFORNIA WHERE WE CAN CONTROL

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.606
IT AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:51.708
NUMBERS ARE AS OPPOSED --

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.009
TO IMPORTING SOMETHING WHERE

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:55.345
WE'RE GUESSING WHAT THE GHG

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:57.314
LEVELS ARE FOR THE OLD RECALL.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.115
I I WOULD SAY IT'S BETTER TO

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.484
SEEK TO TRY --

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.219
TO GET MORE SOURCE SPECIFIC

00:52:02.285 --> 00:52:04.721
INFORMATION SO THAT YOU CAN

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:05.856
MANAGE BOTH THE IMPORTS ON A

00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:07.958
SOURCE SPECIFIC BASIS AND WAY

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.960
THOSE OPTIONS AGAINST INTERNAL

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:10.827
RESOURCES AND THEIR MISSIONS

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:11.461
AFFECTS [inaudible]

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:14.030
GOT IT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE TO

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:15.532
ME YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:16.867
ENERGY COMMISSION HAS JUST

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:18.435
ISSUED A RULING ABOUT PUTTING

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:20.837
MORE SOLAR ON AND IF WE CONTINUE

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:22.305
TO HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH.

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:24.040
WITH A DUCK CURVE IN.

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.509
AND THAT THESE ISSUES OF

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:27.444
IMPORTING ENERGY.

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:29.145
I I DON'T WHAT WHAT'S THE PLAN

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:30.714
OVER AT THE I SO TWO TO DEAL

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:36.319
WITH THIS INFLUX [inaudible]

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:37.954
SO -- WHAT

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:38.989
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OR A

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.690
MULTITUDE OF SOLUTIONS TO DEAL

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:41.591
WITH THE --

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:43.660
INCREASED AMOUNT OF SOLAR ENERGY

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:46.162
AND POTENTIAL OVERSUPPLY --

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:48.231
SOME OF THOSE POINT TWO WORDS ON

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:48.965
OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.834
REGIONALIZATION OTHER THINGS

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:53.103
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES ARE --

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:55.038
STORING IT STORE AN INCREASING

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:57.073
AMOUNT OF STORAGE --

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.309
USING OTHER SECTORS TO HELP YOU

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:01.444
UTILIZE THOSE --

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:03.747
EXCESS CLEAN RESOURCES WHETHER

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:06.383
IT BE ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:08.552
ELECTRIFYING OTHER SECTORS.

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:09.553
AND THEN --

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.620
OTHER THINGS I MENTIONED IS

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:13.056
USING THE CLEAN RESOURCES IN A

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:16.493
WAY TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE THEM FOR

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.361
CENTURY LIABILITY SERVICES THUS

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:21.998
RELYING LESS ON OTHER EMITTING

00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:23.433
RESOURCES THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.036
A HAVING TO STAY ON OTHERWISE I

00:53:26.102 --> 00:53:28.104
JUST BE ABLE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.573
TO BALANCE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.141
DURING THE EVENING HOURS.

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.175
SO THERE'S SUITE OF SOLUTIONS

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:36.012
THAT TERRY ANY ONE OF THOSE

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.647
PROBABLY DOESN'T DO IT BUT WE

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:38.648
THINK THE SWEET TOGETHER IS

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:40.450
PROBABLY THE DIRECTION THAT WE

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:42.485
NEED TO GO TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:44.254
CUT IT NOW HOW WE COULD TALK

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:45.956
ABOUT REGIONALIZATION STORAGE

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:47.190
USING ANOTHER SECTORS WHAT HAVE

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.091
WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.226
POSSIBILITY OF USING THE

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:51.995
EXISTING INFASTRUCTURE FOR YOU

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:52.796
KNOW THINGS LIKE BIOMASS FOR

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:53.997
INSTANCE.

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.665
ADD TO HELP WITH.

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:58.268
WHEN IT'S CLOUDY OUTSIDE AND WE

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:59.202
DON'T HAVE THAT ENERGY BECAUSE

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:01.438
IT'S NOT RELIANT --

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:05.208
THAT'S THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:06.576
WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN THE

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.211
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS AND

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:14.150
INCREASE WE HAD INDICATED TO THE

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:15.318
LOW'S SERVING ENTITIES KIND OF

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:16.820
THIS AS I MENTIONED SORT OF WHAT

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:20.256
WE AT VIEW AS THE OPTIMAL

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:22.425
BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:23.593
NEED TO PROPOSE THE KIND OF

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.595
RESOURCES THAT THEY THINK WILL

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:28.465
MEET THE THE PORTFOLIO THAT WE

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:29.599
LAID OUT IN THE INTEGRATED

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.167
RESOURCE PLANNING SO WHEN THEY

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.570
FILE IN AUGUST --

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:36.206
THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:37.641
TO PERK PROPOSED.

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:38.942
STRATEGIES THAT WOULD BE

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:41.144
CONSISTENT WITHOUT PORTFOLIO.

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:42.812
GOTTEN SO WILL THERE BE A WEIGHT

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:44.848
FOR THE RELIABILITY ON THE SAID

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:48.118
CALIFORNIA TO RELY ON BEING ABLE

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:50.687
TO TO RELY ON THIS ENERGY.

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:51.721
DEPENDING ON THE SOURCES COMING

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:54.491
FROM WELL THAT ONE OF THE INPUTS

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:55.992
WE USED TO DEVELOP --

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:57.627
THE PORTFOLIO WAS THE

00:54:57.694 --> 00:54:59.629
RELIABILITY NEEDS --

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:01.731
AND SO WE INCLUDED --

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:05.335
THE AND THE NECESSARY --

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:06.403
PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN AND

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.705
OTHER RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:11.207
YOU NEED TO BE ME DAILY TO ME.

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.509
AND AS I INDICATED IN MY

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:14.778
PREPARED REMARKS KNOW WE'LL DO

00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:16.379
ANALYSIS --

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.014
TO CHECK FOR OPERABILITY

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:20.850
RELIABILITY CAN BE MAINTAINED ON

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:24.854
AS THE PORTFOLIOS COME TOGETHER

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:26.690
FROM THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES.

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:27.957
AND WILL FEEL THAT BACK IN

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.526
THROUGH THE A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:30.560
UTILITIES COMMISSIONS --

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.428
INTEGRATE RESOURCE PLAN

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.496
PROCEEDING.

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:34.130
CUT IT AND THEN JUST ONE MORE

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.465
QUESTION IF I MAY.

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:36.933
THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.334
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS ARE WE

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.370
LOOKING AT THE NEGATIVE PRICING

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:44.040
ON WHAT THAT MEANS FOR PAYERS.

00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:45.108
WELL HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:50.947
PLAN AS WELL YES.

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:53.416
THANK YOU IN ISRAEL RANDOLPH YOU

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:54.951
HE REALLY TOUCHED ON STORAGE.

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:57.487
WE LOOK AT THE RELIABILITY

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:58.021
FACTOR WITH THE DOCKERS OR

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:58.722
WHATNOT.

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:00.156
WHAT IS THE CURRENT SCORES THAT

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.424
WE HAVE NOW THAT?

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.159
I KNOW YOU MENTIONED OF FUTURE

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:05.595
STORAGE PLANS BUT WHAT'S OUR

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:08.865
COURT STORAGE CAPABILITY NOW.

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:10.700
YOU KNOW I AM SORRY I DON'T KNOW

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:12.168
OFFICE TALK MY HEAD IT'S YEAH

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:14.170
CURRENTLY ON THE SYSTEM RIGHT

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:16.206
NOW IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL.

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:18.007
SO WE LOOK OF RELIABILITY WE

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:20.543
TALK ABOUT SO I I COULD AYE AYE

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.445
SO ON THE CALIFORNIA AND SO PART

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.714
OF THE GRID AND THERE'S PROBABLY

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:25.682
HUNDRED FORTY MEGAWATTS OF GRID

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:28.118
CONNECTED ON A STORAGE.

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:29.352
FACILITIES --

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:32.756
I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS ABOUT

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:33.723
THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OR

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.125
TWO THOUSAND AND WHAT'S EXPECTED

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:37.093
TO BE DEVELOPED --

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.028
GOING FORWARD BUT RIGHT NOW BY

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:39.629
HUNDRED FORTY AND I THINK WE

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.564
HAVE ABOUT THIRTEEN THAT

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:42.265
THIRTEEN HUNDRED PLANNED AND

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:44.000
THEN THE I RP.

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:45.401
REFERENCES TO PORTFOLIO BECAUSE

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:47.036
FROM A TWO THOUSAND SO WE LOOK

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:49.172
AMENITIES TO GET TO RENEWABLES.

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.474
HAD CERTAIN DATES ARE.

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:53.977
DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF MANDATE

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:56.212
FOR STORAGE FOR DATE CERTAIN.

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:56.713
FOR THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.282
MEGAWATTS.

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.251
JUST ELABORATE ON THE QUESTION

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:03.052
EARLIER SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:03.586
STORAGE AND TALKING ABOUT

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:04.988
BATTERY STORAGE --

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.956
THERE ARE OTHER LARGE SCALE

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:08.091
EXISTING --

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:09.793
HYDRA STORAGE FACILITIES IN THE

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.127
SYSTEM --

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:12.729
THINGS ABOUT TWO TO THREE

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.798
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF EXISTING --

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:16.766
HYDRO STORAGE FACILITIES SOME OF

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.034
THOSE ARE NOT CONTROLLABLE

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.269
BECAUSE OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE IS

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:20.637
TO MOVE WATER UP AND DOWN THE

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:22.138
STATE AND ARE NOT REALLY

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.374
AVAILABLE TO MUCH FOR ELECTRICAL

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.842
USE -- BUT

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:27.477
THERE ARE SOME THAT --

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:29.479
ARE SPECIFICALLY IS FOR PINE

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:32.282
DEMAND.

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.316
REALLY GET AGO WE GOOD

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:34.217
RELIABILITY WHEN WE HAVE A

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.218
DROUGHT THOSE ARE REALLY THE

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:36.986
RELIABLE SOURCES SOME TALKING

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:37.954
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAS

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:40.190
TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED.

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:41.391
IT HAS A CONSTANT.

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:43.226
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BEING

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.228
ABLE TO MANDATE RENEWABLES TO A

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:46.062
POINT.

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.864
THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.566
BACK IT UP WITH A PLAN B..

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.501
IS THERE ANY KIND OF PLAN FOR

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:53.236
THAT YOU KNOW I THINK I YOU

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.771
RAISE AN EXCELLENT POINT BECAUSE

00:57:54.838 --> 00:57:56.172
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:59.342
WE ARE WORKING ON A BOTH AYE OUR

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:00.743
P. AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.412
IS -- MAKING

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:04.948
SURE THAT THE OUR MODELING IN

00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:06.216
THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:09.752
ASSUMES THAT THE EXISTING GAS

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:10.587
FLEET.

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:12.856
IS HOTLINE THAT YOU KNOW THAT

00:58:12.922 --> 00:58:14.090
THAT THE ONES THAT ARE UNDER

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:15.391
CONTRACT NOW STAY UNDER CONTRACT

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:17.060
THROUGH.

00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:19.028
TWENTY THIRTY AND SO ONE OF THE

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:20.630
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.565
IN THIS WAS PART OF THE PART OF

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.701
OUR ANALYSIS IN ADOPTING THE

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.069
MULTI YEAR REQUIREMENT WAS.

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:29.005
ARE THOSE PLANS GOING TO HAVE.

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:32.442
ADEQUATE FINANCIAL ABILITY --

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:33.243
TO TO STAY AFLOAT ARE THEY GONNA

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:34.777
GET CONTRACTS THAT ARE

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:35.712
SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THEM

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.513
AVAILABLE --

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.449
BECAUSE OUR MODELING ASSUMES

00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:41.451
THAT THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE --

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:42.952
AND SO --

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:43.553
YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.522
FOUND TO BRING --

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:47.423
MARIN NOBLES AND DEAL WITH

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:50.994
INTERMITTENCY BUT ALSO KEEP THAT --

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.929
FLEET RESPONSIVE --

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:55.265
AND UNDERSTAND WHERE --

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.133
IN LOCAL AREAS THEY MIGHT BE

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.401
IDENTIFIED IS NO LONGER

00:58:58.468 --> 00:59:01.004
NECESSARY BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.338
UNLESS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:05.775
ALTERNATIVE PLAN.

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:06.809
SO WE GO ONE MORE QUESTION

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.144
MISTER.

00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:10.647
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INCREASED --

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:12.115
DEMAND.

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:13.583
ON THE GRID WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.753
EXPERTS AND EXPANDING TO HOLD

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.388
DESERVES ALL OF THE OTHER.

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:20.323
OF OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.392
STATE -- I'M

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:24.060
NOT SEEING A BIG PUSH TO

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.895
INCREASE TRANSMISSION BE ABLE TO

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.163
ACCOMMODATE WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.631
CAPACITY.

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:31.034
THROUGH THIS THIS OPPORTUNITY SO.

I NEED I THINK IT REALLY LOOK

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:37.140
LOOKS AT IT NEEDS TO LOOK AT A

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:38.408
STORAGE IS A BACK UP.

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:41.878
AND BE THE ABILITY.

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.713
TO ADDRESS THEY HAD ADDITIONAL

CAPACITY NEEDED.

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:46.616
ASIDE I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.151
SOME.

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:50.653
KIND OF LOVE UNWILLINGNESS TO

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.356
ADD TRANSMISSION --

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:53.990
THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE OF

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:54.857

TO ADAPT TO BE ABLE.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.834
TO PROVIDE THAT THAT PRODUCT

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:05.134
[inaudible]

GREAT IT OVERSEAS --

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:25.955
AND THAT REGARD WE LOOK AT

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:28.124
TRANSMISSION PLANNING FROM THE

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.426
PERSPECTIVE OF GUIDED BY THE

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:31.694
POLICIES --

PROCESS THAT IS COMING OUT OF

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.043
THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN --

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.711
THAT'S ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES WE

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:49.779
WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THAT

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.481
BECAUSE WE MAY END UP DEVELOPING

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:52.448
TRANSMISSION THAT'S NOT

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.983
NECESSARY --

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.386
IF THE PLAN CHANGES SO WILL

01:00:56.452 --> 01:01:01.057
FOLLOW ALONG AND COORDINATE WITH

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.258
AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTE

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.260
IS THAT THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.496
PLAN PROCESS ASSUMES THAT WE GO

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:08.197
THROUGH THIS REFERENCE SYSTEM

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.032
PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS EVERY TWO

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.833
YEARS.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.535
SO AS CONDITION CHANGED AS

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:13.936
CONDITIONS CHANGE IF WE SEE

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.706
THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW INCREASED --

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.574
BEHIND THE METER --

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:22.178
PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR UPTAKE --

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:22.845
YOU KNOW WE CAN ADJUST

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:24.414
ACCORDINGLY --

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.282
SO THAT KIND OF IT'S A VERY

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.351
ITERATIVE PROCESS WITH US

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.552
FEEDING INTO THE TRANSPORTATION

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:30.987
DATA TRANSMISSION PLANNING

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.488
PROCESS FEEDING INTO LOW

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:33.823
FORECASTING.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:34.524
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.825
COORDINATING AMONGST THE

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:36.793
AGENCIES TRYING TO GET THIS

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.194
PROCESS RIGHT.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:41.030
THAT'S INCURSION THANK YOU.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.031
COULD YOU CAN YOU ELABORATE ON

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:44.000
THE CENTRAL BUYER STRUCTURE THAT

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:44.967
YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR PREPARED

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.370
COMMENTS [inaudible]

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:48.371
TERM.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.306
WE'RE REALLY JUST.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:51.808
STARTING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:54.177
WORD LIMITING IT --

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:56.412
TO ACQUIRING LOCAL --

01:01:56.479 --> 01:02:00.216
RESOURCE ADEQUACY CAPACITY --

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:03.519
CAPACITY AND WE HAVE REQUESTED

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.288
PROPOSALS FROM THE PARTIES IN

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.056
THE PRECEDING ABOUT WHO THIS

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:08.591
THIS CENTRAL BUYER SHOULD BE

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:09.158
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.693
OPTIONS.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.361
YOU CAN HAVE THE AN INVESTOR

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:13.696
OWNED UTILITIES BE A CENTRAL

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:14.730
BUYER YOU COULD HAVE A

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.499
GOVERNMENT AGENCY BE THE CENTRAL

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:17.800
FIRE --

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:20.937
THERE'S A LOT OF PROS AND CONS --

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.672
TO THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS BUT THE

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:25.808
IDEA IS THAT AS THESE ENTITIES

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:26.843
AS THERE ARE AN INCREASING

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.344
NUMBER OF ENTITIES OUT IN THE

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.512
MARKET BUYING SMALL BITS OF

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.481
CAPACITY THAT MAYBE IT MAKES

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:34.484
SENSE. TO CENTRALIZE THAT

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.719
APPROACH AND HAVE ONE AND EIGHTY

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.387
I'M DOING THE BUYING AND THEN

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:38.855
WITH THE COST WOULD BE

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:40.823
ALLOCATING YOU.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.558
A HIGH LAKE SOME OF THE PROS AND

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.760
CONS TO THAT.

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.162
WELL IT'S KIND OF PRESENT KINDS

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:53.669
AS TO SO FOR INSTANCE THE THE

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:55.838
CCA'S FOR INSTANCE WOULD PREFER

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.206
NOT TO HAVE OTHER ENTITIES.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.175
A PURCHASING ON THEIR BEHALF

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:02.512
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE --%

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:04.580
TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN BASED ON

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.449
THEIR OWN GUIDANCE FROM THERE --

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.216
ELECTED OFFICIAL GOVERNING

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:10.186
BODIES SO THAT'S FROM THEIR

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:12.188
PERSPECTIVE THAT'S A KIND --

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:16.325
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I HAVE A

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:19.295
BIAS AGAINST HAVING A GOVERNMENT

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.496
AGENCY --

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.131
PROPOSE IT BECAUSE I AM A LITTLE

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.065
CONCERNED ABOUT SETTING UP A

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.200
WHOLE NEW --

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:27.136
GOVERNMENT ENTITY --

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.671
TO TO DO THE PURCHASING BUT

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:29.338
THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE PROPOSALS

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:31.007
THAT HAS BEEN FLOATED.

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.341
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:33.743
OPTIONS AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:35.278
PROS AND CONS TO THOSE OPTIONS

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:38.080
AND SO WE ARE EXPECTING --

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.615
WITHIN THE NEXT --

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:40.950
THINK ON JULY TENTH WE'RE

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.952
EXPECTING A WRITTEN PROPOSALS

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:45.221
FROM OUR THE PARTIES IN THE

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:46.689
PROCEEDING ABOUT --

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.191
HOW BEST THEY THINK WOULD MAKE

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:52.094
SENSE? TO TO TAKE THIS APPROACH.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:52.995
MY COLLEAGUE.

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.463
OF MINE BAKERSFIELD THAT.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.698
BASS WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:56.799
TECH CURVE IN INTERMITTENT

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:57.967
RESOURCES.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.769
DO YOU HAVE A BALLPARK FIGURE

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.070
WHAT IT COSTS.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:01.737
TO HAVE BACK UP THE INTERMITTENT

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.906
REESE.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:06.275
TIMES OF HIGH.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.578
THE DEMAND THAT NATURAL GAS FOR

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:11.013
EXAMPLE SIR AN ESTIMATED COST TO

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.215
THAT [inaudible]

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:17.253
THE WE'VE TRIED TO ESTIMATE THT --

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.688
AND NOT HAVE --

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.056
TO MAKE SURE I GOT THE RIGHT

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:20.990
FIGURES LIKE GET THAT TO YOU

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:21.924
SHOULD LIKE [inaudible]

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.460
THANK YOU.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:28.130
THE OTHER QUESTIONS COME.

WITH THAT.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.442
WE NEED TO REFORM NETWORK LINDA

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:54.991
I THINK --

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:57.526
MR FRIEDMAN WILL BE PRESENTING

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.928
AND HAVING TO ATTEND ANOTHER A

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.196
COMMITMENT THAT [inaudible]

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:03.099
THEREAFTER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.506
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA --

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:11.907
MY NAME IS MATT FRIEDMAN AND I'M

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:12.908
A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.577
UTILITY REFORM NETWORK I'M HAPPY

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:15.778
TO BE HERE TO PRESENT ON THE

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.079
ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED.

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:18.714
ON THE AGENDA FOR TODAY.

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.416
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BARRIERS

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.351
TO TRACKING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.019
EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.020
PROCUREMENT.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.721
I'M AND HOW CHANGES IN ENERGY

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:26.656
MARKETS ARE CREATING CHALLENGES

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.958
AND OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN WHAT

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.193
THE STATE MIGHT NEED TO DO. TO

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.561
ENSURE THAT NEW RESEARCH SURPLUS

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:33.596
NEW RESOURCES ARE BEING

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.164
DEVELOPED TO MEET STATE POLICY

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.766
OBJECTIVES.

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.034
BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.402
THAT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.404
ACCEPTED APPROACH TO ASSIGNING

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.472
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. TO

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:44.340
ELECTRIC PROCUREMENT BY LOAD

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.808
SERVING ENTITIES.

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.576
ALTHOUGH WE HAD A DISCUSSION THE

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:50.813
PRIOR PANEL ABOUT THE CAP ANDTRADE PROGRAM THE CABIN TRADE

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.781
PROGRAM ASSIGNS COMPLIANCE

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:53.983
OBLIGATIONS ONLY TO INSTATE

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.184
GENERATORS AND IMPORTERS OF

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:56.585
POWER.

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:57.853
THE A OR B. HAS BEEN WORKING

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.822
WITH THE I SO AS WAS MENTIONED

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.023
TO DEVELOP AN APPROACH FOR

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.725
SIGNING GREENHOUSE GAS COSTS

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.026
WITHIN THE ENERGY IMBALANCE

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:04.960
MARKET.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:06.562
BUT THEY'VE HAD THREE ITERATIONS

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:08.264
OF THEIR PROPOSAL SO FAR AND

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.598
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT EVEN THE

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:11.200
MOST RECENT ONE WILL WORK TO

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:12.335
PREVENT RESOURCE SHUFFLING OR

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:14.003
LEAKAGE.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.237
SO RIGHT NOW LOAD SERVING

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.872
ENTITIES MAKING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.808
CLAIMS ON THEIR PRODUCTS ARE

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.209
USING WHATEVER APPROACH THEY

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:21.277
FEEL IS MOST APPROPRIATE IN A

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:22.278
SENSE.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.246
WE ARE IN THE WILD WEST AND

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.414
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN NO

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:26.649
FACT CHECKING OF THESE CLAIMS

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:27.917
BECAUSE THE STATE DOESN'T YET

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:28.884
HAVE A STANDARD.

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:29.752
THAT GOVERNS RETAIL PRODUCT

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.587
DISCLOSURES.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.089
HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO PROCESS IS

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:35.358
UNDER WAY THAT MIGHT HELP. ONE

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.125
IS REVISIONS TO THE POWER

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.426
CONTENT LABEL BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.061
ENERGY COMMISSION PURSUANT TO

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.163
ASSEMBLY BILL --

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.964
ELEVEN TEN AND THE ENERGY

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:43.366
COMMISSION'S DRAFT PROPOSAL

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.600
ALIGNS PRETTY CLOSELY WITH THE A

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.302
ARBY'S APPROACH.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.636
WE EXPECT SOME STANDARD TO BE

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.772
COMING OUT IN.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:50.439
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN IN THE

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:51.574
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.042
PROGRAM THERE'S A CONSIDERATION

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.510
OF ASSIGNING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:56.379
PORTFOLIO TARGETS TO ALL LOAD

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:57.279
SERVING ENTITIES.

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.781
AND TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.383
THAT LOOKS TO MATCH HOURLY

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:02.017
PRODUCTION FROM RESOURCES WITH

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.386
HOURLY LOADS FOR EACH LOW

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.187
SERVING ENTITIES.

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:06.122
IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR WHETHER

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:07.390
THIS APPROACH WILL BE EFFECTIVE

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.858
I'M AND THE PC IS REALLY JUST

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.426
USING THAT TO LOOK AT GREENHOUSE

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:13.195
GAS EMISSIONS IN.

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:13.796
TWENTY THIRTY WE BELIEVE THAT

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.464
PEACE TO COMMISSIONS MAY NEED TO

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.899
CONSIDER OTHER APPROACHES

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.667
DISCLOSURE THAT CLARIFY THE

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:19.769
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROCUREMENT

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.704
STRATEGIES THAT NEARLY RESHUFFLE

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.072
EXISTING LOW GREENHOUSE GAS

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:24.874
EMISSION RESOURCES.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.475
AND THOSE THAT STIMULATE NEW

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:27.676
INVESTMENTS IN INCREMENTAL

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.945
RESOURCES.

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:30.746

WELL WE DON'T HAVE TO GAS WERE

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.301
SEEN IN THE MARKET TODAY.

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:53.769
FIRST THERE'S LOTS OF LARGE

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:54.737
HYDROELECTRIC PRODUCTION IN THE

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:57.306
NORTHWEST CONSERVING CALIFORNIA

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.041
FOR DECADES YOU CAN SIMPLY BY

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.843
SOME ABOUT SURPLUS THAT'S

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.645
ALREADY BEEN SERVING CALIFORNIA.

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.547
AND VOILA YOU HAVE A ZERO CARBON

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.115
PORTFOLIO.

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.650
YOU CAN BUY TRADABLE RENEWABLE

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.385
ENERGY CREDITS FROM PLACES LIKE

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:12.588
BRITISH COLUMBIA ALBERTA WYOMING.

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.523
AND YOU CAN ATTACH THEM TO

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.491
SYSTEM POWER THAT YOU'RE BUYING

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.259
IN CALIFORNIA FROM FOSSIL FUEL

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:18.828
RESOURCES AND YOU CAN CLAIM

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:19.895
YOU'VE GOT A ZERO CARBON

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.630
PORTFOLIO.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:23.132
IF THAT'S WHAT A PROVIDERS

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:23.966
OFFERING ARE YOU INSPIRED BY

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.067
THAT.

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:26.202
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:27.436
SUBSCRIPTION TO THAT PRODUCT IS

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.839
MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:31.674
AND COMPARED TO ANOTHER PRODUCT.

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.142
THAT WOULD BE OFFERED WHERE A

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:33.909
PROVIDERS ACTUALLY MAKING NEW

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:36.111
INVESTMENTS.

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.547
IN NEW RESOURCES DEMAND RESPONSE

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.316
ENERGY STORAGE NEW RENEWABLE

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.784
GENERATION.

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:42.618
WOULD BE MORE INSPIRED BY THAT

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.420
PRODUCT.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.222
HOW WOULD YOU TELL THE TWO APART?

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:47.556
THE ONLY THING YOUR ASKED TO

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:48.424
LOOK AT IS GREENHOUSE GAS

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.359
EMISSIONS.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.293
BECAUSE THESE PORTFOLIOS NOT THE

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.696
SAME.

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:55.130
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT SIMPLY

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:56.732
ASKING CUSTOMERS TO CHOOSE

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.467
AMONGST VARIOUS OPTIONS DOESN'T

01:08:58.534 --> 01:08:59.401
NECESSARILY YIELD SUPERIOR

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:02.071
OUTCOMES BECAUSE CUSTOMERS DON'T

01:09:02.137 --> 01:09:03.739
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S MEANINGFUL IF

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:04.874
THE ONLY METRIC IS GREENHOUSE

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.342
GAS EMISSIONS [inaudible]

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.011
ON AND THAT LEADS ME TO CHANGES

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.012
AN ENERGY MARKETS AND HOW

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:11.113
THEY'RE CREATING CHALLENGES AND

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.649
OPPORTUNITIES --

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.185
WE HAVE AN INTERESTING PARADOX.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.620
DEMAND FOR CLEAN ENERGY HAS

01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:18.654
NEVER BEEN GREATER AT THE

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.022
CUSTOMER LEVEL EVERYONE IS

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.690
CLAMORING FOR CHEAPER AND

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:23.559
CLEANER RESOURCES.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.027
PRICES OF THESE RESOURCES ARE AT

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:26.629
ALL TIME LOWS.

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:28.130
THERE ARE TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.598
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:30.199
THEIR SUN SETTING IN THE NEXT

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:31.500
FEW YEARS.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:32.601
BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING THE

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:34.570
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW RESOURCES.

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:35.771
THE PIPELINE IS ESSENTIALLY RUN

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:38.440
DRY. FOR PROJECTS BEING

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:39.875
DEVELOPED FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUR

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:40.910
DISTRICT MISTER GARCIA.

01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:42.745
WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY DEMAND

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:43.712
THAT'S GOING TO GET THOSE

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.014
GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS BILL.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.116
SO WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT'S GOING

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:49.285
ON IS THAT WE'RE SEEING RETAIL

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:51.420
MARKET FRAGMENTATION.

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:52.688
ESSENTIALLY AND ATOMIZATION OF

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:55.424
RETAIL MARKETS WHERE WE ARE

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.092
TRYING TO RECNCILE THE

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:58.093
PARADIGMS OF PLANNING.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.529
AND CHOICE.

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:01.830
IF EVERY CUSTOMER GETS TO CHOOSE

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.399
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.100
HOW DO WE ENSURE THOSE CHOICES

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:06.669
ADD UP TO SOME KIND OF LONG TERM

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:07.803
RESOURCE PLAN?

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.171
AND OF CUSTOMERS ARE CONSTANTLY

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:11.073
SHIFTING BETWEEN PROVIDERS POWER

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.174
THE PROVIDERS GONNA HAVE THE

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.143
SECURITY THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.744
LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:18.314
ALLOW NEW RESOURCES TO GET BILL.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.515
WE ARE STUCK IN A VERY DIFFICULT

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:20.950
PLACE.

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.284
WE'VE SEEN THE GROWTH OF

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:24.353
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.754
AND COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.324
ARE IN PRINCIPLE VERY COMMITTED

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.824
TO DEVELOPING A CLEANER

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.658
PORTFOLIO.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.060
BUT THEIR BRAND NEW ENTITIES

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.861
THEY HAVE NO TRACK RECORD.

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:33.696
ALMOST NONE OF THEM HAVE CREDIT

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.230
RATINGS.

01:10:35.297 --> 01:10:37.333
AND SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABLE

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.435
CURRENTLY. TO GET BIG NEW

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:41.704
INVESTMENTS IN NEW RESOURCES.

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.672
THERE'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.441
EXPANDING DIRECT ACCESS HERE --

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:46.675
BILL THAT WAS HEARD JUST LAST

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.210
WEEK IN THE ASSEMBLY TOADIES AND

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.144
ENERGY COMMITTEE.

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.547
ON DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS ARE

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:52.147
INHERENTLY SHORT TERM IN THEIR

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:53.649
BEHAVIOR.

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:54.850
THEY BUY AND SELL SHORT THEIR

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:56.685
CUSTOMERS SIGNED UP FOR ONE YEAR

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.053
MAYBE TO YOUR COMMITMENTS.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.221
THEY DON'T MAKE LONG TERM

01:10:59.288 --> 01:10:59.822
COMMITMENTS IN THE WHOLESALE

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:00.623
MARKET.

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:01.991
AND THE UTILITIES ARE BASICALLY

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:03.792
OUT OF THE PROCUREMENT GAME.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:05.628
THEY WENT FROM BEING BIG BUYERS

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:08.530
OF NEW RESOURCES TO NET SELLERS.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.032
AND THE UTILITIES ARE EXTREMELY

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.300
RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN ANY NEW

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:13.602
COMMITMENTS.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.004
WHAT CAN WE DO TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.938
PROBLEM [inaudible]

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.040
WELL.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:18.741
THE STATE NEEDS TO HAVE

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:19.775
COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE PLANNING

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.276
REQUIREMENTS.

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:23.212
AND VIABLE MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:25.714
THOSE DEFINED OBJECTIVES.

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.049
WHAT'S THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT WE

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.817
HAVE IN OUR PS PROGRAM.

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.386
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT AND

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:30.953
THAT'S ESSENTIAL BUT IT'S A

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.087
FLOOR.

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.856
IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT TO GET US TO

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:34.456
THE NEXT STEP OF WHERE WE WANT

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.091
TO GO.

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.027
ALTHOUGH WE DO BELIEVE THAT

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.995
EXPANDING THE OUR PS PROGRAM.

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:40.596
ACCELERATING THE TARGETS WOULD

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:41.997
HELP.

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.465
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.867
WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.468
PLANNING PROGRAM COMMISSIONER

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:47.403
RANDOLPH WAS DISCUSSING THAT IN

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.171
THE LAST PANEL.

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.372
BUT THERE'S UNCLEAR METRICS FOR

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:52.508
ASSESSING COMPLIANCE AND A LOT

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:53.809
OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.210
THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:56.945
ABILITY TO ENFORCE MEANINGFUL

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.113
REQUIREMENTS.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:58.647
ON ALL THE DIFFERENT LOAD

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.683
SERVING ENTITIES.

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:01.950
IT IT JUST TURNS INTO AN

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:03.719
EXERCISE OF EVERY LOAD SERVING

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:05.521
ANY REPORTING WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:06.755
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE FUNDAMENTAL

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.190
PROBLEM THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.793
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS.

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:12.161
AND WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.962
THAT SIMPLY SETTING SIMPLE

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.864
TARGETS FOR EVERY ENTITY WILL

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:17.900
ENCOURAGE ALL THE BUYERS.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.935
SELLERS AND TRADERS TO TAKE

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.170
ADVANTAGE OF ANY LOOPHOLE OR

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:23.138
AMBIGUITY IN THE RULES TO SEEK

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:25.340
LEAST COST OUTCOMES THAT MAY

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.042
PRODUCE RESULTS EVERY DIFFERENT.

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:27.843
FROM WHAT POLICYMAKERS ARE

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:30.345
EXPECTING.

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:31.680
IN OUR VIEW RESOLVING THE

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:34.083
MISMATCH BETWEEN SHORT TERM.

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.918
MARKET ACTORS AND LONG TERM

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:37.986
GOALS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A NEW

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:41.123
SET OF PROCUREMENT STRUCTURES.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.791
ONE OPTION THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.526
IN SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.095
HERE IS JUST REQUIRE EVERY LOAD

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.663
SERVING ENTITY TO ACQUIRE A

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.364
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF ANY NEW

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:51.500
POLICY OBLIGATION.

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.202
THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO YOU MAKE A

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:54.737
LARGE NUMBER OF BUYERS TAKE A

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.505
FRACTIONAL SHARE OF A VERY SMALL

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:59.408
NUMBER OF NEW RESOURCES.

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:00.576
THEY'RE APPROXIMATELY FIVE

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:01.410
DEVELOPERS OF SALTON SEA

ENTITIES.

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:08.484
HOW WOULD A GEOTHERMAL MANDATE

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.718
THAT APPLIES TO SEVENTY LOAD

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:10.886
SERVING ENTITIES THAT HAVE TO

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.454
BUY A FRACTIONAL SHARE A FIVE

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.589
RESOURCES REALLY OPERATING

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:15.691
PRACTICE?

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:17.159
HOW WOULD WE DEAL WITH MARKET

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.828
POWER ABUSES BY SELLERS?

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.997
IN ORDER TO MAKE A LONG TERM

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.799
PROCUREMENT OBLIGATION WORK.

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:25.934
WE'RE GONNA NEED A NEW STRUCTURE.

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.035
IT'S GONNA REQUIRE GUARANTEED

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:29.037
RATE RECOVERY.

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:30.873
IT MAY NEED TO REQUIRE MAY BE TO

ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES.

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:39.882
IT COULD BE A STATE AGENCY.

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.116
IT COULD BE THE GREAT OPERATOR

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.684
ALTHOUGH THAT CREATES PROBLEMS

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.253
ASSOCIATED WITH FEDERAL

RESOURCES ON DISADVANTAGED

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:12.160
COMMUNITIES.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:13.762
AND THAT THEY GIVE PREFERENCE TO

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.397
RENEWABLE PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.365
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO THESE

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:18.533
COMMUNITIES.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.102
CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES ALSO CAN

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:21.837
BRING ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.038
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SUCH

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.940
AS JOBS AND INCREASED TAX

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:25.874
REVENUE.

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.809
OUR A SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THESE

ARE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.515
SOME CHALLENGES DO LIE AHEAD AS

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:35.384
YOU HEARD.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.185
IF LLC SUCH AS CCA'S AND DIRECT

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.154
ACCESS PROVIDERS DO NOT PLAN FOR

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:40.288
SUFFICIENT PROCUREMENT TO

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.656
SUPPORT RELIABILITY.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:42.891
THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:43.725
TO ORDER LONG TERM PROCUREMENT

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.560
COMMITMENTS.

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:47.763
IN THIS SITUATION IT IS POSSIBLE

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:48.897
THAT SOME ARE ALREADY PEERS

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:51.099
WOULD INCUR HIGHER COSTS.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:53.235
THEREFORE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:54.770
ALL ELLIS CEASED MEET THEIR

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:57.005
PROCUREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.340
ALSO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:00.175
DEPLOYMENT OF AN OPTIMAL MIX OF

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:02.044
COST EFFECTIVE RESOURCES THAT

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:03.078
SERVE LOAD.

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.913
INTEGRATE ME NORMALS ENSURE

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.082
RELIABILITY AND MEET THE STATE'S

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.151
GHG GOALS FLEXIBILITY TO

CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:13.321
MUST BE PRESERVED.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.689
ANOTHER CHALLENGES UP THE

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:15.791
UTILITIES CURRENTLY HAVE

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.259
CONTRACTED FOR RENEWABLES IN

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:18.927
EXCESS OF WHAT IS NEEDED TO MEET

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:20.629
THERE ARE PS TARGETS AND THEY

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:22.564
ARE SELLING OFF EXCESS RENEWABLE

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:22.898
ENERGY AS YOU.

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.966
ALSO HEARD.

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:26.635
WHEN WE NO CONTRACTS A RENEWABLE

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:28.036
ENERGY CREDITS ARE SOLD IS

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:29.805
USUALLY AT A LOSS THAT'S COSTING

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.373
RAPIERS FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.108
THEY ARE NOT USING? TO

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:35.077
EFFECTIVELY REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.845
ENERGY FROM A CLEAN RESOURCE

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.814
MUST REPLACE A GHG EMITTING

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.150
RESOURCE AND NOT BE SOLD OR USE

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.318
IN ADDITION TO A GHG EMITTING

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.187
RESOURCE.

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:47.923
THE I RP OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:49.825
TO ASSESS THE SITUATION TO HELP

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:52.294
DETERMINE THE BEST PORTFOLIO MIX

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.995
BASED ON WHAT IS AVAILABLE.

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.597
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.332
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:58.333
AND STORED.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.769
ALSO ARE WAYS OF THAT CAN

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:04.940
ADDRESS THIS IS THE SITUATION.

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.641
AS FOR VARIOUS TO TRACKING GHG

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:07.943
EMISSIONS THE CHALLENGE RIGHT

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:09.744
NOW IS REALLY HOW TO COUNT THEM.

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.413
IN AN ISOLATED SYSTEM IT'S EASY

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.614
TO DETERMINE THE SYSTEMS TOTAL

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.683
EMISSIONS AND GENERATION BUT AS

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:16.485
YOU'D GOTTEN UTILITIES RETAIL

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.186
SELLERS AND OVERLAPPING

INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:25.927
THE PC HAS ADOPTED A REASONABLE

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.596
APPROACH WHICH WE WHICH WILL BE

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:30.132
TESTED IN THE UPCOMING IRP PLANS.

EVALUATION OF HOW WELL IT WORKS

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:39.574
AND WHETHER IT NEEDS ADJUSTMENT.

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:41.243
THE IRP PROCESS HELPS TO

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.277
IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.745
NUVEEN RENEWABLE PROJECTS

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.580
INCLUDING THEIR TIGHTENING.

WHILE THE LARGE UTILITIES HAVE

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:32.027
MET THIS REQUIREMENT OTHER LSE'S.

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:34.229
SUCH AS CCA'S ALSO MUST PROCURE

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:35.730
SUFFICIENT LONG TERM OUR PS

01:20:35.797 --> 01:20:37.999
ELIGIBLE RESOURCES.

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:40.101
IN THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT.

KAISER TO WORK TOGETHER TO

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:47.542
DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES MUST BE

RETAINED.

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:50.178
AND THE NEED FOR NEW PROCUREMENT

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:51.313
TO ADDRESS ANY POTENTIAL

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.315
SHORTFALLS.

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.083
RESOURCES COULD BE PROCURED BY

WHILE MAINTAINING RELIABILITY.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.065
AS AN EXAMPLE.

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:12.167
PGDM EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.144
SUCH COOPERATION COULD ENABLE

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.312
THE LONG TERM PROCUREMENT OF

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:25.981

UTILITIES ARE CURRENTLY

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:47.235
EXCEEDING THEIR TARGETS AND WE

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.470
KNOW THE PRICES OF DROP

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:49.804
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:51.506
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HURDLES

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:52.907
IN GETTING NEW RENEWABLE

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.976
PROJECTS ONLINE ALTHOUGH THERE

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.444
IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:57.679
ENSURING RENEWABLES THAT ARE

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:58.446
ALREADY PROCURED.

THE CCA'S ANOTHER RETAIL SELLERS

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.985
OF THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:04.486
FOR INCREASED RENEWABLE

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:06.421

01:22:11.192 --> 01:22:11.726
I'LL STOP THERE THANK YOU VERY

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:22.070
MUCH -- SOME

NICE TO SEE YOU MY NAME'S HUNTER

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:27.509
STERN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.277
CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:31.379
EMPLOYEES --

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.181
AND I'LL KNOW THAT --

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:34.382
WHEN YOU MENTIONED --

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:35.817
SCOTT WHICH IS NAMED THE YOUR

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:38.987
COLLEAGUES GOT UP AND LEFT.

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:44.125
SO WHAT WHAT I WANTED.

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.260
TO I'M GLAD SOME IS AWAKE.

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:47.062
OKAY SO WHAT WHAT WE WANTED TO

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:47.829
COVER --

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:51.933
MOST OF WHAT WE WERE.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:52.867
THERE'S ARE PROBABLY PICKED UP

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.836
BY -- FOLLOW

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.905
FOLLOWING SPEAKERS AS WELL BUT

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:59.074
LET'S LET US SERVE FOCUSING ON

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.475
THREE DIFFERENT AREAS --

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:02.444
IN TERMS OF OF THE CHALLENGES

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.945
TRACKING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.313
EMISSIONS --

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.948
SIMPLY PUT WE DON'T HAVE A

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:08.717
STANDARDIZED APPROACH --

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:11.119
THE STATE DOESN'T CURRENTLY DO

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:13.321
WHAT IS NEEDED TO DO TO DO TO

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:14.823
DETERMINE HOW MUCH.

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.891
COMMISSIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:19.227
WHICH RESOURCES WHICH LOAD

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:21.396
SERVING ENERGIES ARE USING --

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:23.264
THERE'S HOPE --

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:24.065
THAT -- QUE

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.768
BE -- ELEVEN

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:27.402
TEN WHICH IS PAST COUPLE YEARS

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:30.171
AGO AND IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:31.673
GETTING A REGULATORY APPROVAL AT

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.441
THE ENERGY COMMISSION --

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:35.477
WILL DO THAT --

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:37.045
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME GAPS.

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:39.247
AND SO THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.949
WE NEED A STANDARDIZED APPROACH --

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:44.285
SECONDLY IN TERMS OF THE MAJOR

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:47.222
CHANGE IN ENERGY PER CHAIRMAN --

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:49.457
IT'S THAT ITS WHO.

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:50.992
ARE NOW PROCURING ELECTRICITY --

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:55.663
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:56.798
COMMISSIONER PETERMAN MENTIONED

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.534
CCA'S ARE ON THE RISE THAT IS

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.436
THE BIG DIFFERENCE HOME WHERE

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:02.570
THREE YEARS AGO THEIR PROCURING

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:04.139
ALMOST NOTHING.

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:05.373
AND IN THE FUTURE THEY MAY

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.408
PROCURE SO MUCH AS 80% OF THE

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:08.710
POWER --

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.779
THAT IS A HUGE CHANGE AND THE

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.348
IMPACTS OF THAT CHANGE ARE BEING

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.150
FELT THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:16.751
AND THROUGHOUT THE CLEAN POWER

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:19.521
GOALS AT THE STATUS SAID ITSELF --

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:22.590
AND THEN AGAIN THIS IS A

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:24.259
SIMPLIFIED OR A SHORTER VERSION

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:26.294
OF WHAT I PLAN TO SAY --

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.996
THE CHALLENGES OF OF BUILDING

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:29.564
NEW ENERGY PROJECTS OF THIS IS

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:30.832
OUR WORK --

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:33.101
THE IBEW DE IS [inaudible]

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:36.037
THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:38.273
UTILITY EMPLOYEES --

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:40.275
AND WE REPRESENT WORKERS HAD THE

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:41.342
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:43.545
PUBLIC PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.246
AND WE HAVE OUR CONSTRUCTION

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:47.415
MEMBERS WHO BUILT THESE PROJECTS.

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:49.184
AND THE CURRENTLY NOT DOING A

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:52.086
MISTER FRIEDMAN MENTIONED THIS --

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:53.888
AT ONE POINT THERE WAS AS MANY

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:56.925
AS FIFTEEN THOUSAND FULL TIME

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.026
EQUIVALENTS --

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:59.327
WHICH IS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:00.628
AHEAD --

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:01.763
WORKING ON THESE PROJECTS

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.131
ANNUALLY --

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:06.634
AND NOW IT'S VERY MUCH SMALLER

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.136
THAN THAT --

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.338
WE NEED THE COMMITMENT. TO HAVE

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:12.340
RESOURCES BUILT.

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:14.809
AND USED IN THE STATE --

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:15.910
THERE ARE --

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:17.946
EVEN -- YEAH

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:20.448
THE CHI SO IS PART OF THEIR

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:21.950
THREE FIFTY STUDIES IDENTIFIED

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:24.018
THE POTENTIAL OF A HUNDRED

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:24.552
THOUSAND JOBS BEING LOST.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:27.055
LOST IF THE SO CALLED BUCKET

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:29.257
SYSTEM IS NOT RETAIN --

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.960
THAT'S PART OF HOW WE DEVELOPED

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:34.329
THE PROGRAM AND THIS SUCCESSFUL

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:35.997
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:39.000
OF THESE GOALS WHETHER IS THREE

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:42.270
FIFTY OR TO SP TWO ONE ACTS

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:44.172
BEFORE IT --

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:46.708
AND THE RPF ALL THE WAY THROUGH --

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:49.344
THE MAJOR CHALLENGE IS ENSURING

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:50.979
THAT THE SPOT COMMUNITY TRACE

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:53.348
AGGREGATORS ARE SIGNING LONG

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:54.582
TERM POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:58.553
WHICH THEN CREATE THE CONFIDENCE.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.588
IN THE DEVELOPERS IT TAKEN GOING

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:03.191
TO SEEK THE FUNDING THE LOANS TO

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:04.926
BUILD THE PROJECTS THEMSELVES.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.828
IF THOSE POWER IF THOSE PPACA

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:09.197
SHORT TERM --

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.532
THEY CAN'T GET MONEY TO THE

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:11.299
DEVELOPERS CAN GET MONEY TO

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:12.834
BUILD THEM AND OUR MEMBERS DON'T

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:13.568
WORK.

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:14.369

ALSO LOWER COST ELECTRICITY.

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:35.390
SO ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN A WIN

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:36.591

FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FULL TIME

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:19.847
EMPLOYEES ONCE THE PROJECT IS UP

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:22.116
AND OPERATING.

01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:23.618
CONTRARYTO WHAT YOU HEARD TODAY

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:25.186
WE ARE DEVELOPING.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.687
A PROJECTS IN THE IMPERIAL

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.923
VALLEY TRUCK HAVEN IS A PROJECT

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.757
THAT WE HAVE UNDER ACTIVE

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:31.159
DEVELOPMENT WE'RE EXPANDING OUR

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.160
MAMMOTH FACILITY WITH THE

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:33.294
DEVELOPMENT OF A PROJECT CALLED

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:35.763
CASA DIABLO FOR IN MONO COUNTY.

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:36.798
AND WE JUST ACQUIRED A COMPANY

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:38.699
CALLED U. S. GEOTHERMAL WHICH

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:41.869
HAS A LEASES IN THE GEYSER AREA

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:43.237
AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE NEW

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:43.771
RESEARCH THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:45.039
OBTAINED.

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:45.773
WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THE

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.141
GEOTHERMAL SECTOR TODAY IS KIND

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:49.677
OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND ON

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:50.912
SLIDE SEVEN THE YOU HAVE.

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:52.180
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT IN THE

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:54.215
LAST DECADE 90% OF THE

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.383
GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS THE UNITED

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.417
STATES HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH A

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:57.985
BINARY TECHNOLOGY?

01:30:58.052 --> 01:30:59.654
AND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT IT

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.556
ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY.

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:02.990
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE CAN

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:03.491
DEVELOP LOW TEMPERATURE

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:06.394
RESOURCES THEY PRODUCE NEAR ZERO

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.029
EMISSIONS AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:10.097
FLEXIBLE SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:12.033
AT THE CARBON ICING THE GRID.

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:12.733
GEOTHERMAL TWO POINT OH WERE

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.068
CALLING IT.

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:16.437
IS REALLY EXCITING TO INVESTOR

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.039
OWNED UTILITIES LOAD SERVING

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.841
ENTITIES CCA'S AND OTHERS

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.742
BECAUSE WE CAN RAMP THE OUTPUT

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:24.045
OF THESE FACILITIES. TO MITIGATE

01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:25.947
THE DUCK CURVE --

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:27.949
I FELT OBLIGED TO INCLUDE A

01:31:28.015 --> 01:31:29.383
SLIDE OF THE DARKER BECAUSE I

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:29.951
BUT DIDN'T THINK YOU'RE ALL

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:31.419
FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:33.621
JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THE VALUE OF

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:34.689
THE ENERGY IS SHIFTING

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:37.091
CONSIDERABLY AND SO.

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:38.326
IF YOU GO TO MY S. LIKE TEN

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:39.794
YOU'LL SEE.

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:41.128
GEOTHERMAL VALUE TODAY IS

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:42.597
INCREASING IMMENSELY BECAUSE WE

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:44.265
PRODUCE POWER WHEN THE

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:45.933
INTERMITTENT RESOURCES DAHLE.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.735
IT'S IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:49.103
CALIFORNIA WAS INCREDIBLY

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.438
SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPING

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:51.639
INTERMITTENT RESOURCES IT

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.140
DEVELOP CLOSE TO FOURTEEN

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:54.508
GIGAWATTS OF INTERMITTENT

01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:56.277
RESOURCES IN THE LAST DECADE.

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.112
AND WHAT THAT DONE HAS SHIFTED

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:00.248
THE FOCUS TO RESOURCES THAT ARE

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:01.816
EMISSION FREEING CAN PRODUCE

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.985
POWER CAPACITY OR ENERGY WHEN

01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:04.986
YOU NEED IT.

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:06.754
AND SO TODAY IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:07.488
SEEING THE GEOTHERMAL HAS A

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:09.624
VALUE COMBINED VALUE OF BOTH

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.125
ENERGY CAPACITY AND ANCILLARY

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.126
BENEFITS.

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.527
OF CLOSE TO THIRTY TWO DOLLARS A

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:15.429
MEGAWATT HOUR MORE THAN JUST

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:17.164
SOLAR PEAVEY.

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:18.733
AND THAT'S ALLOWING US TO SECURE

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:21.335
CONTRACTS TODAY MOVING FORWARD

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:21.936
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE EXCITING

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:26.474
PART.

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.109
IF I TAKE YOU DISLIKE TWELVE OF

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:30.378
OF MY FLIGHT DECK YOU'LL SEE

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:31.112
GEOTHERMAL TWO POINT KNOWING

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:32.146
YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.948
DESCRIPTION THE BINARY PROCESS

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:35.483
AND TO TRY TO BOIL IT DOWN TO

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:37.685
ITS SIMPLE IS THE DESCRIPTION.

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.153
WE BRING UP HIGH GEOTHERMAL

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.888
FLUID WE HEAT A SECONDARY

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:42.356
WORKING FLUID WHICH IS WHAT

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.659
VAPORIZES BUILDS PRESSURE TURNS

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:45.393
THE TURBINE.

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:47.361
THE BEAUTY OF THAT IS WE INJECT

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:48.996
1100% OF THE GEOTHERMAL FLUID

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:50.598
BACK INTO THE RESERVOIR.

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:51.799
AND THE WORKING FLUID WHICH

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.567
VAPORIZES WE KEEP IN A CLOSED

01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:54.835
SYSTEM.

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:55.736
SO IT --

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:57.305
COOLS BACK DOWN TURNS BACK INTO

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:59.040
LIQUID HEAT BACK UP AND THERE'S

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:01.108
NEAR ZERO EMISSIONS WHAT THIS

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:03.377
ALLOWS US TO DO IS PROVIDE.

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:05.780
CRITICAL SERVICES TO THE GRID TO

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:07.114
HELP WITH THE CARBONIZATION WE

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.649
CAN PROVIDE FLEXIBLE CAPACITY

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:10.284
MEAN WE CAN RAMP THE ENTIRE

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:12.320
FACILITY --

01:33:12.386 --> 01:33:13.521
50% OF THE NAMEPLATE OF THE

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:16.123
FENCES FACILITY PERMIT.

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:17.191
WE CAN PROVIDE REGULATION

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.193
SERVICES FREQUENCY RESPONSE

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:20.962
SERVICES AND CONTINGENCY

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:22.964
RESERVES SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:24.065
THIS DEEP PENETRATION OF

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.566
INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE RESOURCES

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:26.901
AND HOW ARE WE GOING.

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:29.437
TO KIND OF BRING THOSE ON AND

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:32.406
BACK THOSE UP WITH A CARBON FREE

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:34.275
RESOURCE GEOTHERMAL TO POINT IT

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:35.643
CAN BE OUR ANSWER.

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:37.211
WE ALSO PROVIDE NONTRADITIONAL

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.679
ANCILLARY SERVICES LIKE VOLTAGE

01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:43.751
CONTROL AND INERTIA.

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:45.353
GETTING SPECIFICALLY OF WELL

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:45.987
THAT THE LAST THING I'LL POINT

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.254
OUT AND WE HEARD COMMISSION

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:48.856
RANDOLPH TALK ABOUT IT.

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:50.858
THE CPUC RESOLVE MODEL PDATED

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.393
WITH ITS MOST RECENT LOAD

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.128
FORECAST SELECTED ABOUT

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:54.895
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:57.298
NEW GEOTHERMAL IN THE FORTY TWO

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:58.766
AND T. SCENARIO.

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.568
AND THE COST THAT THEY USE THAT

01:34:00.634 --> 01:34:02.103
IT WAS STILL SELECT WAS ABOUT

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:03.270
EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.538
SIX CENTS TO NINETY ONE DOLLARS

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:06.040
AND SIXTY THREE CENTS A MEGAWATT

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:07.641
HOUR.

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.744
THOSE PRICES ARE EXTREMELY HIGH.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.245
IF YOU TAKE THE MOST RECENT PP

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.847
ACHE CONTRACTS EXECUTED IN

01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:14.148
CALIFORNIA.

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:16.984
THE MODEL YIELDS ABOUT TWO POINT

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.252
FIVE GIGAWATTS OR THREE

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.021
GIGAWATTS OF NEW GEOTHERMAL TO

01:34:20.087 --> 01:34:21.455
BE DEVELOPED.

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:23.324
WHEN YOU ALSO TAKE OFF THE

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:24.925
CONSTRAINT OF THE RESOURCE AREA?

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:26.060
AND WHEN WE ARE EXPERTS WERE

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.661
LOOKING AT THE RESOLVE MODEL WE

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:29.096
WERE KIND OF CONSTRAINED TO JUST

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:30.564
CALIFORNIA.

01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:31.665
WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THOSE

01:34:31.732 --> 01:34:32.733
CONSTRAINTS IN A REGIONAL

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.635
APPROACH YOU'LL SEE THAT EXPANDS

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.170
THE THREE GIGAWATTS OF

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:37.571
GENERATION AND I THINK AT SOME

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.173
OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE SAID?

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.274
WE'RE GONNA NEED EVERYTHING IN

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.176
OUR WHEELHOUSE TO DEVELOP THOSE

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:44.311
RESOURCES CONSIDERING CAL YOU

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:47.048
KNOW THE NATION HAS ABOUT. THREE

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:48.649
POINT FIVE GIGAWATTS OF TOTAL

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:50.918
GEOTHERMAL GENERATION OPERATING

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:52.319
AND IT'S TAKEN ABOUT FIFTY YEARS

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:54.422
TO DEVELOP SO WE THINK BUCKET

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:55.756
ONE ELIGIBILITY IS INCREDIBLY

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:56.724
IMPORTANT.

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:57.992
AND WE NEED TO START DEVELOPING

01:34:58.059 --> 01:35:01.796
ALL THE FAST AS POSSIBLE.

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:04.131
K. GEOTHERMAL --

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:05.933
SURVIVE IN A CHANGING MARKET WE

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:06.534
THINK THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.271
YES. FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:11.639
WE'VE ONLY SOLD POWER TO

01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:13.140
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT IS

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.442
CHANGING WHERE NOW SELLING IT TO

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:16.043
PEEL USE WE ARE HAVING

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.611
DISCUSSIONS WITH CCA'S.

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:18.846
WE SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH LARGE

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:19.947
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:22.149
OPERATORS WHO RECOGNIZE THIS

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.484
INCREDIBLE VALUE OF THE

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:24.718
GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE THAT'S NOT

01:35:24.785 --> 01:35:26.120
ONLY EMISSION FREE.

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:27.388
BUT CAN RAMP AND PROVIDE THE

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.690
FLEXIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:31.459
OPERATIONS RUNNING DAY TODAY.

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.160
WHAT WE STRUGGLE WITH HIM MY

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:36.030
LAST SLIDE IS?

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:40.267
KIND OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:41.502
CURRENT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.003
NETS WE NEED THIS KIND OF

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.638
TRANSPARENCY LONGEVITY AND

01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:46.207
CERTAINTY AND WE'RE SEEING

01:35:46.273 --> 01:35:48.642
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OR LOAD

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:50.344
SERVING ENTITIES FOR A BROADER

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:52.079
TERM KIND OF SHY AWAY FROM

TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BECAUSE OF A

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:56.584
POSSIBLE OUR PS.

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.119

BE ELIGIBLE OR INCLUDED.

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:05.926
IN THOSE POLICIES MOVING FORWARD

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:06.494
AND SO.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.429
I WOULD JUST.

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:09.864
WE'RE SEEING THAT IN REAL TIME

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:11.298
AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUT CLIMATE

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:13.501
CHANGE KIND OF ON HOLD WHILE WE

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:14.802
TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT SO MAYBE.

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.737

TOM I WANT TO START BY TAKING A

01:36:49.069 --> 01:36:50.271
LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE COME OVER

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:52.640
THE PAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:54.608
AB THIRTY TWO WAS PASSED TWELVE

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:55.910
YEARS AGO WHEN IT SET AN

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:57.144
AMBITIOUS TARGET FOR CLIMATE

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:59.813
ACTION OF REDUCING OUR EMISSIONS

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.347
TO NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS.

01:37:00.414 --> 01:37:01.649
BY.

01:37:01.715 --> 01:37:02.216
TWENTY TWENTY REALLY DO MUCH

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:04.051
BETTER THAN THAT.

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:06.620
AB ONE NEXT TO THE 33% ARE PS

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:07.922
LEGISLATION.

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:09.757
WAS PASSED NEARLY A DECADE AGO

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:11.258
KNIT SOUTHERN AMBITIOUS GOAL OF

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:12.092
GETTING A THIRD OF OUR

ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLES BY.

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:16.096
TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE GONNA DO

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:17.965
MUCH BETTER THAN THAT.

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.934
S. B. THREE FIFTY WAS PASSED A

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.902
HANDFUL OF YEARS AGO AND IT'S AN

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:23.837
AMBITIOUS TARGET A 50% WERE

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.206
NOBLES BY.

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:26.106
TWENTY THIRTY AND A DOUBLING OF

01:37:26.173 --> 01:37:28.075
OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY SAVINGS.

01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:29.610
WE'RE NOT ONLY ON TRACK TO MEET

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.378
BOTH THOSE TARGETS BUT THE I'LL

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:32.580
USE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THE

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:35.482
RENEWABLES TARGET A DECADE EARLY.

01:37:35.549 --> 01:37:37.284
PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD RAISE

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.018
AT TARGET.

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:39.453
AND CUT THE REMAINING FOSSIL

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.454
GENERATION IN.

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:40.988
TWENTY THIRTY BY NEARLY A

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:43.457
QUARTER.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:44.725
WE'VE LACK LIKEWISE SAID

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.360
AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR LOW CARBON

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:49.263
FUELS VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:50.030
FOR ENERGY STORAGE.

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:52.666
AND WE'RE ON TRACK ARE EXCEEDING.

01:37:52.733 --> 01:37:53.634
OR INCREASING OUR ROLES IN EVERY

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:55.135
RESPECT.

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:57.538
SO WHERE ARE WE TODAY.

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.139
WE'RE NOBLES ARE CLEARLY THE LOW

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.307
COST OPTION FOR NEW GENERATION

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:03.444
THE COMPETITIVE BIDS FOR NGUYEN

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.346
CONSOLE IN THE RANGE OF TWO TO

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:06.113
FOUR CENTS AND DROPPING.

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.882
I I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T --

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:10.150
REFER TO THE PRESENTATIONMERELY

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.253
PERFORMING WHERE YOU'VE HEARD OF

01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:14.288
IMPRESSIVE DECLINES IN THE COST

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.757
OF NEW GEOTHERMAL GENERATION --

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:17.992
WHICH GIVES US AN ADDITIONAL

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:20.294
IMPORTANT OPTION.

01:38:20.361 --> 01:38:22.162
BUT IN MANY CASES NEWER NOBLES

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.264
ARE CHEAPER THAN EXISTING COAL

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:24.865
PLANTS.

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:26.834
THAT'S A HUGE TAIL WHEN FOR D.

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:28.602
CARBON ISING THE GREAT.

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:29.870
IT'S A HUGE TRANSFORMATION OF

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:32.106
THE ENERGY SYSTEM THAT'S

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:34.074
UNPARALLELED AND PROVIDES A

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:34.675
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.043
STATE.

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:37.478
HONEST ON ON IN TERMS OF ENERGY

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:39.346
EFFICIENCY.

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:41.315
JUST ONE EXAMPLE LED LIGHTING IS

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:43.317
THE NEW NORMAL.

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.785
WHICH HAS ONE QUARTER THE

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:46.553
CONSUMPTION OF INCANDESCENT

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.522
LIGHTING AND LASTS TEN TIMES

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:50.524
LONGER MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:51.659
FOR CONSUMERS.

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:52.459
AND MORE FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:55.195
APPLICATIONS [inaudible]

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.964
LAMB.

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:58.032
IN TERMS OF OUR CLIMATE POLICY

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.133
WE HAVE AN AMBITIOUS GOAL IN

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:00.901
PLACE FOR TWENTY THIRTY WE HAVE

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.536
CLEAR AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:05.339
MARKETPLACE PROGRAM TO GET THERE.

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:06.740
ONLY MENTION THAT THE COST OF

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:08.242
STORAGE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:09.877
DROPPING FAST.

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:11.645
WITH EXPECTED FIRST COST

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:13.681
BREAKEVEN FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:15.449
EXPECTED SOMETIME IN THE FIRST

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:17.985
HALF THE NEXT DECADE.

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:18.852
SO I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:20.554
WORK THAT'S YET TO BE DONE

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:21.689
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IT TO BE

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:22.956
DONE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:24.024
EMPHASIZE.

01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:25.993
THAT WE CAN WE HAVE MADE

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:27.027
EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE FOR

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.662
AMBITIOUS.

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.064
COMMITTED AND FOCUSED

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:30.364
[inaudible]

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.566
SO.

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.368
WITH REMAINS HOW MUCH.

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.202
ONE TALK ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS

01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:36.970
IT REMAINS TO BE DONE WHERE THE

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:39.306
KEY CHALLENGES AHEAD.

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:40.974
FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO CONTINUE

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:41.575
TO CARBONIZED IN THE ELECTRIC

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.310
GRID.

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:44.178
WE NEED HIGHER LEVELS OF

01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:45.746
RENEWABLES BOTH BEHIND AND IN

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:48.015
FRONT OF THE MEDIA.

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:50.050
WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:51.385
OF THE GREAT IN GREAT MEASURE

01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:52.386
NOBLES YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.288
WE'RE SEEING A TRANSFORMATION OF

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:55.756
THE GRIP OF A FOSSIL DOMINATED

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.292
GRID. TO RENEWABLES GENERATES.

01:39:58.359 --> 01:39:59.827
AND THAT'S GOOD REQUIRE --

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:01.128
NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:03.564
APPROACHES TO GRID MANAGEMENT

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:05.132
INCLUDING INCREASE STORAGE.

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:06.433
IMPROVEMENTS IN DEMAND RESPONSE

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.235
AND MANAGE CHARGING.

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:10.204
AND A REGIONAL MARKET.

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:11.472
REGIONAL MARKET IS CRITICAL

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:13.006
BECAUSE ALLOWS US TO MAKE BEST

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:14.575
USE OF THE EXISTING WERE NOBLES

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:16.110
OF OUR GENERATION. TO TAKE

01:40:16.176 --> 01:40:17.378
ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:19.346
BRING AND LOW COST RESOURCES

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:22.149
FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE.

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:22.983
AT AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY A

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:24.752
COUPLE TIMES TODAY THE REASON

01:40:24.818 --> 01:40:26.120
MARKET WILL HELP TREMENDOUSLY IN

01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:26.620
TRACKING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.255
EMISSIONS.

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:31.492
IMPROVE OUR ACCOUNTING.

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.727
SECOND WE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:35.396
EFFORTS ENERGY EFFICIENCY NEED

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:36.630
EXPANDED PROGRAMS WITH STATE

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.165
WHAT COORDINATION.

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:38.999
WE NEED TO BRING IN NEW

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.000
TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:42.102
PROGRAMMATIC APPROACHES.

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:43.470
ENERGY EFFICIENCY WILL BE

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:44.905
ESSENTIAL FOR NOW ONLY LOWER

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:46.874
EMISSIONS FOR KEEPING OUR COSTS

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:49.309
LOW THAT'S CRITICAL TO CONTINUE

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:52.246
TO GET CONSUMER SUPPORT.

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:54.181
THIRD WE NEED TO DE CARBONIZED

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:55.949
BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORTATION.

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:56.917
THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE INCREASED

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:59.420
INVESTMENT --

01:40:59.486 --> 01:41:00.854
DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:01.822
OF HEAT PUMPS OF LOW CARBON

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:04.124
FUELS.

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:05.192
AND FINALLY --

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:06.927
AND FAR FROM LEAST WE NEED TO

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:08.529
REMEDY THE LEGACY OF POLLUTION

01:41:08.595 --> 01:41:10.063
AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:11.331
NEED TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:12.232
LEFT BEHIND.

01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:13.200
AND EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:15.502
BENEFITS.

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:16.970
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:41:17.037 --> 01:41:18.472
TALK TO SAY.

01:41:18.539 --> 01:41:20.073
THANK YOU HAVE GOT TO WORK.

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:20.574
SPECIAL QUESTION TO MY

01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:23.010
COLLEAGUES AT STEPPED OUT --

01:41:23.076 --> 01:41:25.012
BASED ON THE PRIOR PANEL

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:26.914
DISCUSSION AND IDEAS THAT WE

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:28.015
SHARED --

01:41:28.081 --> 01:41:30.117
BIOMASS AND THE CENTRAL PRECURE

01:41:30.184 --> 01:41:31.618
MEANT WONDERING WHO.

01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:32.786
GOT SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT WAY

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:38.725
AND A BIT ON THAT.

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:40.494
NOT ALL OF YOU COULD TAKE A STAB

01:41:40.561 --> 01:41:41.395
AT THE QUESTION THAT'S WHY.

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:42.729
I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A AN INITIAL

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:45.466
STAB AT CENTRAL PROCUREMENT --

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:47.701
MANY THE CONCERN HERE AS HAS

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:48.836
BEEN TOUCHED UPON BY NUMBER THE

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:50.337
PANELISTS.

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:53.106
IS THAT WE ARE NOT SURE WHO IS

01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:54.908
SUPPOSED TO BE UNDERTAKING LONG

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:56.343
TERM PROCUREMENT ON BEHALF OF

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.045
ALL CUSTOMERS THE UTILITIES.

01:41:58.111 --> 01:41:59.046
HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:00.681
ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN TASKED

01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:03.116
WITH THIS OBLIGATION AND THEY

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.384
KNOW HOW TO DO IT --

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:06.854
BUT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.856
UTILITIES ARE NOW NO LONGER

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:10.123
WILLING TO UNDERTAKE LONG TERM

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.992
CONTRACT COMMITMENTS UNLESS THEY

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:14.194
HAVE A IRONCLAD ASSURANCES THAT

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:16.096
THE COSTS CAN BE FULLY RECOVERED

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.298
ON A NON BY PASSABLE BASIS FROM

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.666
ALL CUSTOMERS.

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:21.602
IN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY.

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:23.337
MEANWHILE WE HAVE NEW ENTRANTS

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:24.671
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:26.507
DIRECT ACCESS SUPPLIERS WHO DO

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:27.875
NOT WANT THE UTILITIES TO BE

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:28.942
BUYING ON THEIR BEHALF WOULD

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:31.712
PREFER TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES --

01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:33.046
THE P. YOU SEE IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:34.681
LOOKING AT ALL OF THE CHOICES

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:36.250
THAT EVERY ENTITY WOULD LIKE TO

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:38.285
PURSUE. TO ADD THEM UP AND TO

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.653
SEE WHERE THERE ARE GAPS

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.988
RELATIVE TO THE GOALS THAT THEY

01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:42.055
HAVE ESTABLISHED.

01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:44.124
IF THERE'S A GAP.

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:45.292
THE P. YOU SEE IS SUPPOSED TO

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.227
TRY TO ORDER SOMEBODY OR SOME

01:42:47.294 --> 01:42:48.662
COLLECTION OF ENTITIES TO GO OUT

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:50.230
AND BUY THINGS.

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:51.932
AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:54.301
UNTESTED MODEL SO FAR WE DON'T

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:55.836
KNOW IF OR HOW IT'S GOING TO

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.304
WORK.

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:59.006
AND ONE ALTERNATIVE.

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:01.008
IS FOR THE STATE TO IDENTIFY

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:02.376
ENTITY WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:04.578
MIGHT BE. TO DO THIS TYPE OF

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:06.380
PROCUREMENT.

01:43:06.446 --> 01:43:07.848
THAT FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:09.149
WHEN YOU ADD UP THE COMBINED

01:43:09.216 --> 01:43:10.584
PREFERENCES OF ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:12.119
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES.

01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:13.654
WHO MIGHT THIS ENTITY BE WHAT

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.289
MIGHT LOOK LIKE?

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:17.157
WE COULD USE THE UTILITIES.

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:18.759
BUT THEY WOULD NEED THOSE

01:43:18.825 --> 01:43:19.793
IRONCLAD ASSURANCES OF COST

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.695
RECOVERY.

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:23.397
WE COULD DEPUTISE A THIRD PARTY

01:43:23.463 --> 01:43:24.798
ANY THAT WOULD BE CHARTERED

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:26.600
ESSENTIALLY AS A PROCUREMENT

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:28.435
ENTITY RESPONSIBLE THE STATE

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:30.137
REGULATORS THAT COULD GO OUT AND

01:43:30.203 --> 01:43:31.305
UNDERTAKE THIS PROCUREMENT WITH

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:33.140
COST RECOVERY AUTHORITY.

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:35.842
WE COULD USE A STATE AGENCY --

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:37.144
WE TRIED THAT BEFOREWE HAD A

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:39.279
MIXED RESULT BUT WE TRIED USING

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:41.081
A STATE AGENCY THAT BEING THE

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:42.649
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN

01:43:42.716 --> 01:43:44.384
THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST ENERGY

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.587
CRISIS IN THE STATE'S HISTORY.

01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:47.220
IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO GET UP AND

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:48.789
RUNNING QUICKLY.

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.390
IF WE HAVE TIME.

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:52.225
AND WE CAN PLAN THIS EFFORT WE

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:53.493
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A MORE

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.829
RATIONAL APPROACH TO THE STATE.

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:57.564
INTO THESE TYPE OF COMMITMENTS

01:43:57.631 --> 01:43:58.865
AND MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS TO YOU

01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:00.067
STATE FINANCING TO BRING DOWN

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:02.235
THE COST OF NEW PROJECTS.

01:44:02.302 --> 01:44:03.370
KEY WOULD BE THAT ANY

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:04.204
CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.139
MECHANISM HAS TO HAVE THE

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:08.508
ABILITY TO RECOVER ALL THE COSTS

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:10.677
AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE FROM ALL

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:12.479
MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:13.914
SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO GO

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:15.549
ABOUT THIS.

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:16.650
SOME MAY REQUIRE ENABLING

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.986
LEGISLATION OTHERS COULD BE

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.387
CONSIDERED BY THE P. YOU SEE.

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:21.989
BUT THE KEY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:23.991
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:25.692
AND THAT WHATEVER GETS BOUGHT IS

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:26.526
PART OF WHAT FALLS THROUGH THE

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:28.962
CRACKS WHEN ALL OF THE LOAD

01:44:29.029 --> 01:44:30.263
SERVING ENTITIES PROPOSALS ARE

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:31.832
PUT TOGETHER AND WE SEE WHAT'S

01:44:31.898 --> 01:44:32.499
MISSING.

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:33.800
AND WHAT THE STATE STILL FEELS

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:35.102
LIKE IT NEEDS TO DEVELOP

01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:35.402
[inaudible]

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:36.837
THE OTHER.

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:39.973
THE VISION LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.609
YEAH TO SO THE AGAIN HUNTER

01:44:42.676 --> 01:44:43.043
STERN --

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:44.911
WITH THE CODE CALIFORNIA

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.780
COALITION HE TOLD EMPLOYEES SO I

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:48.949
IN TERMS IT SUCH PROCUREMENT --

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:51.818
I THINK WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:54.421
IS TO FIRST START DATE HAVE

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:55.756
EVERYBODY START FROM THE SAME.

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:57.824
POINT OF VIEW WORKPLACE AND THAT

01:44:57.891 --> 01:45:00.227
IS OF THE CPU SEE --

01:45:00.293 --> 01:45:02.029
IRP DE INTEGRATED RESOURCE

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:03.864
PLANNING WE NEED A PLAN THE

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:06.199
STATE NEED TO PLAN --

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:08.735
IT INNER IN ORDER TO ENSURE

01:45:08.802 --> 01:45:10.070
RESOURCE ADEQUACY.

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.372
WE NEED A PLAN AND AGAIN SOME A

01:45:12.439 --> 01:45:13.807
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ARE

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.042
SUGGESTING THEY MAY OR MAY NOT.

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:17.044
SPACE THAT PLAN.

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:19.246
EVERYBODY HAVE TO PLAY IF IT FOR

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:21.415
NOT FOLLOWING THE SAME PLAN --

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:22.849
WHAT MISTER FRIEDMAN SUGGEST

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:26.186
WILL ACTUALLY BE THE NEXT MAJOR --

01:45:26.253 --> 01:45:29.623
ENERGY CRISIS IN.

01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:30.590
BECAUSE WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:32.392
ENERGY FOR WHEN WE NEED.

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:42.169
SO THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL --

01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:44.004
FROM A CENTRAL A THERE'S A

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:46.373
FUNCTION OF COST OBVIOUSLY AND

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.075
THERE'S ALSO --

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:50.410
A LAWSUIT WHICH IS BEING DEALT

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:52.679
WITH -- IT

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:54.481
THE SAME TIME WE HAVE OTHER

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:55.816
ISSUES INCLUDING --

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:59.486
WILDFIRE IN EXCESS FUEL --

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:00.587
SO I AGAIN THIS WOULD PROBABLY

01:46:00.654 --> 01:46:02.889
REQUIRE ANY LEGISLATIVE --

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:04.391
APPROACH --

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:06.326
IF.

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:08.562
THE BALANCE OF REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.697
NEEDS --

01:46:10.764 --> 01:46:12.833
INCLUDE GREATER PROCUREMENT FROM

01:46:12.899 --> 01:46:15.402
BIOMASS RESOURCES --

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:16.837
THAT CERTAINLY AVAILABLE IT BUT

01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:18.271
AGAIN IT BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:20.040
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

01:46:20.107 --> 01:46:20.574
BUT I DON'T USE THE TERM

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.275
ORGANICALLY --

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:23.944
IT'S NOT SOME THAT WILL HAPPEN

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.712
WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR.

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:25.979
THANK YOU.

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.080
PLEASE [inaudible]

01:46:27.147 --> 01:46:30.751
NUANCE.

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:32.052
SO -- IN

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:32.986
ADDITION TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:34.688
SAID AYE I'D WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:36.723
THAT NIGHT AND I COMPLETELY

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:38.658
AGREE THAT THE IRAQI IS CRITICAL

01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:39.760
IN TERMS OF CENTRALIZED PLANNING

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:41.328
FOR PROCUREMENT.

01:46:41.394 --> 01:46:43.563
OF THE THE THREE UNDERPINNINGS

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:44.664
TO THEY ARE P. AND THEY'RE

01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:46.900
THEY'RE VERY KEY EITHER CRITICAL

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.268
ITS RELIABILITY THE FOCUS ON

01:46:48.335 --> 01:46:49.669
RELIABILITY.

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.238
THE FOCUS ON INTEGRATING

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:53.206
RENEWABLE RESOURCES.

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:55.142
I AND THE FINALS COST.

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:57.144
MINIMIZATION YET TO MAKE SURE

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:59.312
THAT WE DO IT COST EFFECTIVELY --

01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:01.281
AND AND ARRIVING AT THE OPTIMAL

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:03.517
RESOURCE MIX BASED ON THOSE KEEP

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:05.285
THREE KEY FACTORS --

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:08.388
IS IMPORTANT I TO PREVENT OF

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:09.489
OPERATE HERE PRETTY PREVENT

01:47:09.556 --> 01:47:11.691
STRANDED ASSETS.

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:12.959
WAS A STRANDED ASSETS WE PASSED

01:47:13.026 --> 01:47:15.695
ON TO RATEPAYERS.

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:17.364
SO AGAIN PLANNING.

01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:19.099
OF WHILE THAT IS UNTESTED A

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:21.034
HOUSE TO BE DONE IT IS IT'S VERY

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:22.803
KEY AND WHAT THE COMMISSION IS.

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:24.171
HAS SET FORTH --

01:47:24.237 --> 01:47:30.443
WE THINK IS IS A GOOD. TO SEE

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:31.545
KNOWN ELSE SAID IT WOULD ASK THE

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:33.146
QUESTION WE KNOW.

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:35.549
THAT THEM AT THE CORE OF YOU

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:37.417
KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN.

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:38.518
LOOKING AT THESE VARIOUS

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:40.420
DIFFERENT DATA.

01:47:40.487 --> 01:47:43.056
PROCUREMENT TAP PROCESSES OR FOR

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:43.356
[inaudible]

01:47:43.423 --> 01:47:44.658
CENTRALIZED [inaudible]

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:46.393
A MODEL.

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:48.562
THAT WE THINK OF THE RATEPAYERS --

01:47:48.628 --> 01:47:50.597
PERCIFORM MOST BUT WHAT OTHER

01:47:50.664 --> 01:47:51.364
ECONOMIC [inaudible]

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:53.266
BENEFITS.

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:55.068
COULD BE FACTORED IN AS WE'RE

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:57.604
LOOKING AT THEM CLIMATE POLICIES

01:47:57.671 --> 01:47:59.372
AS TO TRY TO REDUCE JEEZ JEEZ I

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:00.707
MEAN.

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:02.242
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT DE DO WE

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.177
HAVE ANYTHING THAT WE USE AS A

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:06.313
FORMULA ALREADY --

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:08.148
TO DETERMINE --

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:10.016
OTHER BIG ECONOMIC BENEFITS

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.785
BEYOND --

01:48:11.852 --> 01:48:12.385
RATEPAYERS --

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:16.256
SAVINGS.

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:17.624
UP AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:19.593
IRP PROCESS CONSIDERS

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:22.162
PRIORITIZING NUVEEN RENEWABLE

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:23.830
AND OTHER RESOURCE PROJECTS.

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:25.365
IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:26.933
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE WENT AND IN

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.235
TERMS OF SUPPORTING THOSE THREE

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:30.270
FACTORS THAT I THAT I JUST

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:33.440
MENTIONED --

01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:36.643
THE IEP PROCESS CAN ALSO LEAD TO

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:38.545
A ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:40.347
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:48:40.413 --> 01:48:43.149
SUCH AS INCREASED JOBS --

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:45.452
AND MORE TAX REVENUE FOR THE

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:46.953
LOCAL COMMUNITY WE WANNA MAKE

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.289
SURE THAT THOSE BENEFITS FLOW TO

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:50.390
THE CUSTOMERS IN THE

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:51.658
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOT

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:53.193
JUST OUTSIDE OF THOSE

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:53.827
COMMUNITIES SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:54.594
THAT.

01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:56.329
OR IS GONNA BE PAYING PARTICULAR

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:57.998
ATTENTION TO AS WE LOOK AT THE

01:48:58.064 --> 01:48:59.032
PLANS THAT ARE DO YOU ALL IN

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:01.635
AUGUST.

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.870
ANYONE ELSE WOULD.

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:05.138
HELLO ALL JUST ADD THAT WE'VE

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:06.640
GOT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE THE

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.174
DECREASE IN THE COST OF OUR

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:10.210
NOBLE SAYS PROVIDES THE ABILITY

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:11.912
TO PROPER PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:13.179
FOR CONFLUENCE OF BENEFITS --

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:14.848
BY --

01:49:14.915 --> 01:49:16.549
INVESTING ROBLES WE CAN LOWER

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:18.652
THE COST OF ELECTRICITY AND

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:21.288
REDUCE --

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:22.756
CRITERIA CLINTON EMISSIONS AND

01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:25.158
PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS AS WELL

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:28.328
SO THERE'S STILL A TREMENDOUS --

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.496
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO

01:49:29.562 --> 01:49:31.197
SOCIETY FROM REDUCING THE IMPACT

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:32.632
OF CLIMATE CHANGE --

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.200
BUT THERE CAN ALSO BE A LOCAL

01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:35.502
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:37.337
APPROVED AIR QUALITY --

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:41.207
BY INVESTING IN REAL CASE.

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:42.976
NEITHER CLOSING COMMENTS FROM

01:49:43.043 --> 01:49:44.244
ANY OF THE PANELISTS ON THIS

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:48.014
SUBJECT TRIP.

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:49.249
JUST A ONE FOLLOW UP ON THE

01:49:49.316 --> 01:49:50.650
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN THERE'S

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:51.785
BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:52.686
THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:53.520
PROBLEM I JUST WANNA REALLY

01:49:53.586 --> 01:49:55.388
CAUTION --

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.624
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:58.625
AYE TEMPER THEIR EXPECTATIONS IN

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:00.593
THIS RESPECT --

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.829
WITH YOU SEE IS ACTUALLY TO HOLD

01:50:02.896 --> 01:50:06.132
ENTITIES TO DO IS.

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:08.234
TO MEET GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

01:50:08.301 --> 01:50:10.804
TARGETS FOR THEIR PORTFOLIO.

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.639
SHOW US THAT YOU HAVE A GHG

01:50:12.706 --> 01:50:15.742
EMISSIONS RATE ARM THAT IS AT A

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:16.676
CERTAIN LEVEL.

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:18.511
AND TELL US THAT YOU'RE GONNA

01:50:18.578 --> 01:50:20.213
GET THERE BY.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:20.780
TWENTY THIRTY I STARTED MY

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:22.816
PRESENTATION BY POINTING OUT ALL

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.250
OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:26.052
GREENHOUSE GAS METRICS CAN BE

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.887
GAMED AND MANIPULATED. TO

01:50:27.954 --> 01:50:29.356
PRODUCE RESULTS THAT ARE VERY

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:31.157
CONTRARY TO WHAT POLICYMAKERS

01:50:31.224 --> 01:50:33.660
MIGHT ANTICIPATE. FOR EXAMPLE I

01:50:33.727 --> 01:50:34.561
MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT YOU

01:50:34.627 --> 01:50:35.962
COULD SIMPLY SAY WE'RE GONNA BUY

01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:37.330
A BUNCH OF EXISTING NORTHWEST

01:50:37.397 --> 01:50:38.198
HYDRO.

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.733
WERE DONE WE MET THE GREENHOUSE

01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:41.835
GAS TARGETS --

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:43.336
BUT PROVIDER MIGHT SAY WE DON'T

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:44.137
WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOW

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.638
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TARGET

01:50:45.705 --> 01:50:47.440
BY BUYING SURPLUS NUCLEAR POWER

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.742
FROM THE PALLAVA THE NUCLEAR

01:50:48.808 --> 01:50:50.543
PLANT IN ARIZONA THAT'S ZERO

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:50.777
CARBON.

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:53.279
WERE DONE.

01:50:53.346 --> 01:50:54.481
DON'T EXPECT THAT A GREENHOUSE

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:56.349
GAS SPACE TARGET IS GOING TO

01:50:56.416 --> 01:50:57.784
PRODUCE INVESTMENT IN NEW

01:50:57.851 --> 01:51:00.186
RESOURCES IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:01.287
THESE ARE DIFFERENT APPROACHES

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:03.056
DIFFERENT METRICS.

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:05.058
AND IT'S MY VIEW THAT WE NEED TO

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:07.527
BE FOCUSED NOT ON GREENHOUSE GAS

01:51:07.594 --> 01:51:09.229
EMISSIONS ON A STANDALONE BASIS

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:11.398
BUT ON DRIVING INVESTMENT IN NEW

01:51:11.464 --> 01:51:13.633
FACILITIES BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:14.267
GET.

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:15.568
INCREMENTAL AND ADDITIONAL

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:18.872
RESULTS THAT MAKE THE WORLD ARE

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:20.073
ESSENTIALLY THAT ALLOW US TO

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.142
HAVE A CLEANER GRID THAT LEAD TO

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:23.910
REAL GREEDY CARBONIZATION AND

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:25.278
DON'T JUST PRODUCE AN ACCOUNTING

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:26.913
EXERCISE THAT MAKES US FEEL LIKE

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.415
WE GOT A CLEANER GRADE.

01:51:28.481 --> 01:51:28.948
WHEN LITERALLY NOTHING IS

01:51:29.015 --> 01:51:31.384
CHANGING [inaudible]

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:35.722
IT COMES [inaudible]

01:51:35.789 --> 01:51:38.224
WHO KNOWS?

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.759
YEAH I'M JUST ELDERS HAD BRIEFLY

01:51:39.826 --> 01:51:41.394
TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MISTER

01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:43.396
FREEMAN JUST SAID --

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:44.998
THE IN THE NEW PROJECTS ALSO IT

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:46.599
WOULD PUT PEOPLE TO WORK YOU

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:48.468
ASKED ABOUT ECONOMIC BENEFITS.

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:50.303
PEOPLE WORKING PROVIDE ECONOMIC

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.638
BENEFITS TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:51.938
[inaudible]

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:54.808
THANK YOU STOP.

01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:55.942
I CHAIRMAN I WOULD JUST SAY

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:56.943
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.578
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I THINK

01:51:58.645 --> 01:51:59.212
YOU KNOW.

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:01.081
THESE ARE THE EXACT QUESTIONS

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.282
THAT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:03.616
ASKING AT THIS TIME AND AND

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:05.285
WHILE SUMMER I THINK DISCOURAGED

01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:06.186
ABOUT IT I THINK IT'S AN

01:52:06.252 --> 01:52:08.488
INCREDIBLY EXCITING DISCUSSION.

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:09.923
AND YOU KNOW EVEN YOUR

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:11.691
PROCUREMENT QUESTION I MEAN IS.

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:12.892
ONE THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN

01:52:12.959 --> 01:52:14.627
MULTIPLE STATES --

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:15.929
I WAS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.464
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:18.965
NEVADA AND WE HAD AN IRP.

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:22.469
AND WE ALSO HAD A VERY DIFFERENT --

01:52:22.535 --> 01:52:23.503
UTILITY STRUCTURE THAN YOU HAVE

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:25.572
IN CALIFORNIA FAR LESS DIVERSE

01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:27.240
AND AND YOU KNOW A FRACTION OF

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:28.875
THE SIZE AND SO.

01:52:28.942 --> 01:52:29.442
AT WHAT LEVEL DO YOU LOOK AT

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:32.178
THAT PROCUREMENT IS AND YOU

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:33.113
ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE HAVING IN

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:36.349
YEARS NO EASY ANSWER BUT I THINK --

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:37.951
YOU'RE GONNA GET YOU KNOW A LOT

01:52:38.017 --> 01:52:39.853
OF INFORMATION HERE --

01:52:39.919 --> 01:52:41.588
I THINK RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:43.756
ARE RESILIENT AND WILL LOOK TO

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:45.191
DEVELOP THESE PROJECTS AND

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:47.193
DEVELOP NEW PROJECTS AND I THINK

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:48.928
THERE ARE MANY DEVELOPERS WHO

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:50.263
WOULD BE YOU KNOW WHO COULD SIT

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:51.798
RIGHT HERE AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:53.500
THAT THE DESIRE TO BUILD NEW

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:56.136
PROJECTS TO GROW THEIR COMPANIES --

01:52:56.202 --> 01:52:57.470
AND INVEST IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:59.539
STOCK MARKET DOESN'T LOOK A

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:01.174
KINDLY ON COMPANIES THAT JUST

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:03.610
SHUFFLE WHERE THEIR MEGAWATTS

01:53:03.676 --> 01:53:05.612
ARE COMING FROM FROM FROM

01:53:05.678 --> 01:53:07.580
DIFFERENT AREAS AND SO FORTH SO --

01:53:07.647 --> 01:53:09.582
YOU KNOW WE CAN WORK IN THOSE

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:10.683
DIFFERENT STRUCTURES WHATEVER

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.552
THEY MAY BE AS LONG AS WE HAVE

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:14.387
LEGISLATIVE CLARITY ON WHAT WE

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:16.456
WANT TO DO MOVING FORWARD.

01:53:16.523 --> 01:53:18.124
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE.

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:19.025
TO MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.326
POSSIBLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND

BE CALLING UP THE NEXT STEP

01:53:26.733 --> 01:53:28.034
PANEL.

01:53:28.101 --> 01:53:29.068
NOW WE HAVE CAN CAUSE WOULD SAN

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:31.337

MICHAEL CURRY LOS ANGELES

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:33.806
DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER.

IN MELISSA BRENT EAST BAY

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:51.391
COMMUNITY ENERGY

01:53:52.425 --> 01:53:52.592
[inaudible]

01:53:52.659 --> 01:54:00.600
THAT COULD.

THAT THINK TO OF OUR CENTERS ARE

STILL TIED UP ON RED CARPET

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:07.006
[inaudible]

01:54:07.073 --> 01:54:08.908
THE DATA.

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:12.145
THEY'RE WATCHING STAFF SEARED.

REALLY APPRECIATE THEM TAKEN THE

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:14.480
TIME TO PARTICIPATE.

YES THANK YOU CAN'T BECAUSE WITH

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:21.154
SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC THANKS

FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:22.889
TO YOU TODAY.

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:24.591
OF THE BACKROOM MATERIALS POSE

01:54:24.657 --> 01:54:25.992
THREE QUESTIONS BECAUSE WERE NOT

01:54:26.059 --> 01:54:27.093
A DEVELOPER OF RENEWABLE

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.795
RESOURCES I WILL SKIP OVER THAT

01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:30.330
ONE AND JUST FOCUS MY COMMENTS

01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:31.731
ON THE OTHER.

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:32.599
TO THE FIRST QUESTION RAISES THE

01:54:32.665 --> 01:54:35.501
ISSUE OF BARRIERS S. MISSIONS AN

01:54:35.568 --> 01:54:37.270
EARLIER PANEL TALKED ABOUT.

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.539
THE USE OF MARKET PURCHASES AND

01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:41.140
IMPORTS.

01:54:41.207 --> 01:54:43.576
BASED ON TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:54:43.643 --> 01:54:44.410
NUMBERS --

01:54:44.477 --> 01:54:46.446
WE SEE HALF OF THE PROVIDERS

01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:48.948
THAT REPORT POWER CONTENT LITTLE

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:49.916
INFORMATION TO THE ENERGY

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:52.318
COMMISSION HAD OVER 40% OF THE

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.920
RESOURCE COMING FROM.

01:54:53.987 --> 01:54:55.622
SUCH PURCHASES UNSPECIFIED

01:54:55.688 --> 01:54:56.990
POWERS NOT SURE WHERE THOSE

01:54:57.056 --> 01:54:58.091
NUMBERS CAME FROM.

01:54:58.157 --> 01:55:00.960
BUT FOR US THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT.

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.462
ISSUE WITH REPORTING OF

01:55:02.528 --> 01:55:04.230
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:06.299
RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:07.333
SOME UNSPECIFIED PARA BUT AS YOU

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:09.002
REDUCE THAT NUMBER AND GET FROM

01:55:09.068 --> 01:55:10.236
SOURCES DIRECTLY.

01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:12.438
THAT SHOULD HELP IN DEALING WITH

01:55:12.505 --> 01:55:14.073
THOSE ISSUES --

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.808
I'D ALSO POINT OUT JUST.

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:17.844
FOR GIGGLES I GUESS ON THE POWER

01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:18.978
CONTENT LABEL WE KNOW THAT

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:20.713
THERE'S STILL FIFTEEN OF THE

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.048
SEVENTY REPORTING UTILITIES

01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:23.483
PROVIDING POWER TO THEIR

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:26.286
CUSTOMERS FROM COAL RESOURCES.

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:27.687
SWEEPING VETS ANOTHER

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.022
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE SPECIAL IN

01:55:29.088 --> 01:55:30.390
LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT NO COLD

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:30.990
BILL WAS PASSED OVER A DECADE

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:32.525
AGO.

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:33.693
THE SECOND QUESTION RISEN BACK

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.094
FROM MATERIALS FOCUSED ON HOW

01:55:35.161 --> 01:55:36.629
THE CHANGES IN IN A CHIU

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:38.231
PROCUREMENT CREATE CHALLENGES

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:39.666
AND OPPORTUNITIES.

01:55:39.732 --> 01:55:41.401
IN OUR VIEW THERE ARE TWO KEY

01:55:41.467 --> 01:55:44.404
CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE ALREADY

01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:45.071
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THEM TODAY.

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:45.705
THE FIRST WHICH RELATES TO THE

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:46.806
UNCERTAINTY OF LOAD FOR INVESTOR

01:55:46.873 --> 01:55:48.207
OWNED UTILITIES.

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:50.310
AND THE SECOND IS ALLOCATION OF

01:55:50.376 --> 01:55:51.778
COSTS TO THOSE.

01:55:51.844 --> 01:55:53.579
NEW PROVIDERS OF SERVICE.

01:55:53.646 --> 01:55:54.981
IN MAY OF LAST YEAR THE CPUC

01:55:55.048 --> 01:55:56.582
ISSUED A STAFF WHITE PAPER ON

01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:58.618
CUSTOMER IN RETAIL CHOICE WITH

01:55:58.685 --> 01:56:00.320
EVOLVING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.

01:56:00.386 --> 01:56:02.722
IN THAT REPORT THEY NOTED 85% OF

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:04.857
RETAIL LOAD COULD BE SERVED BY

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:06.526
OTHER PROVIDERS THEN THE I USED

01:56:06.592 --> 01:56:08.061
BY.

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:08.695
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN AUGUST OF

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.430
LAST YEAR THE CHAIRMAN OF CC IN

01:56:10.496 --> 01:56:11.531
THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. UC

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.199
JOINTLY WROTE A LETTER TO THEM

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:14.467
PRO TEM DE LEóN.

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:15.835
WHERE THEY STATED THAT IT WAS

01:56:15.902 --> 01:56:17.437
NOT UNREASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:20.606
THE I. O. U.'S COULD LOSE 6290%

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:21.174
WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHT TO TEN

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.141
YEARS?

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:23.943
AND THEN FINALLY IN AUGUST OF

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:25.445
LAST YEAR THE SENATE ENERGY

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:26.079
COMMITTEE HELD AN INFORMATIONAL

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:27.413
HEARING.

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.148
WHERE THEY NOTED 80% OF THE LOAD

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:30.750
SO ONE OF THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES

01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:32.251
TALKED ABOUT 80%?

01:56:32.318 --> 01:56:34.387
THINK THAT'S PRETTY FAIR EIGHTY

01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:35.254
EIGHTY FIVE THEM UP TO NINETY

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:37.190
FROM. THREE DIFFERENT REPORTS IN

01:56:37.256 --> 01:56:39.025
THE LAST YEAR --

01:56:39.092 --> 01:56:40.393
THIS UNCERTAINTY MAKES IT NEARLY

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.894
IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST POWER

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:43.096
NEEDS AND FUTURE AND MAKE

01:56:43.162 --> 01:56:44.764
PROCUREMENT DECISIONS BASED THAT

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:46.199
ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:48.501
CUSTOMERS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:50.002
AND ARE RELATIVELY SMALL SERVICE

01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:51.537
TERRITORY OF SINGLE GOVERNMENTAL

01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:53.940
JURISDICTION COULD DEPART AND

01:56:54.006 --> 01:56:55.575
THAT WOULD BE 40% OF OUR LOAD

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:57.343
VIRTUALLY OVERNIGHT.

01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:58.711
THE SECOND COMPLICATING FACTORS

01:56:58.778 --> 01:57:00.847
ALLOCATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:01.514
THE DEPARTING WITH WE'VE TALKED

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.215
ABOUT.

01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:03.816
EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS SHIFTING

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:06.119
OF COSTS SERVED BY CCA UNBUNDLED

01:57:06.185 --> 01:57:07.687
CUSTOMERS IN MY YOU.

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:08.888
BUT THAT IS NOT YET BEEN

01:57:08.955 --> 01:57:10.690
ADDRESSED THE LAWS CLEAR MOST

02:03:14.553 --> 02:03:15.187
WHERE.

02:03:15.254 --> 02:03:17.356
THEY INSTALL WE INSTALLED A

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:19.992
BATTERY SYSTEM AS WELL AS SOLAR

02:03:20.059 --> 02:03:22.428
ON THE ROOFS AND TWO WEEKS AFTER

02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:22.962
COMMISSIONING THERE WAS AN

02:03:23.028 --> 02:03:24.330
OUTAGE.

02:03:24.396 --> 02:03:26.165
THEY HAVE A DIESEL GENERATOR BUT

02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:27.666
BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM THEY WERE

02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:29.168
ABLE TO RUN THROUGH THAT FOUR

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:30.870
HOUR OUTAGE WITHOUT FIRING UP

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:32.171
THERE DIESEL GENERATOR AND

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:32.972
WITHOUT LOSING ANY CRITICAL

02:03:33.038 --> 02:03:35.908
LOADS.

02:03:35.975 --> 02:03:36.909
MOVING ON TO SLIDE HIM ONE OF

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.511
THE OTHER INNOVATIVE PROCESS --

02:03:38.577 --> 02:03:39.779
STORAGE PROJECTS WE'RE LOOKING

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:42.815
AT IS COMPRESSED AIR THERE IS --

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.216
ONLY TO PROJECTS IN THE WORLD

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:45.718
THAT WE'RE AWARE OF BECAUSE OF

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:47.920
THE UNIQUE TO YOU SHE'LL FOR THE

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.355
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

02:03:49.421 --> 02:03:50.356
GROUND UNDERNEATH.

02:03:50.422 --> 02:03:53.058
SO ESSENTIALLY ON THIS WOULD BE

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:54.827
A UTILITY SCALE PROJECT THOUGHT

02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:56.128
YOU WOULD WHEN THERE'S ABUNDANT

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:58.697
ENERGY YOUR OVERSUPPLY YOU USE --

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:00.132
YOU COMPRESS THE AIR INTO THE

02:04:00.199 --> 02:04:02.501
SALT CAVERNS UNDERGROUND.

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:04.470
AND WHEN YOU NEED THE ENERGY YOU

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:05.871
RUN IT THROUGH AN EXPANDER TO

02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:07.139
PULL THE AIR OUT AND RUN A

02:04:07.206 --> 02:04:09.141
GENERATOR TO CREATE. TO IT TO

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:10.676
USE IT WHEN YOU NEED IT --

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:14.647
THIS LAW A SMALL HUNDRED SIXTY

02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:16.048
MEGAWATT PILOT PROGRAM.

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:18.217
PROJECT FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT BUT

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:20.419
ON THIS LOCATION COULD BE

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:22.621
FIFTEEN HUNTER TWO THOUSAND

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:23.055
MEGAWATTS.

02:04:23.122 --> 02:04:25.691
NAM CAPABILITY ONE OF OUR

02:04:25.758 --> 02:04:26.559
CHALLENGES --

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:28.093
AYE AYE I CALL THIS LIKE A TALE

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.796
OF TWO SEASONS ONE SLIDE ELEVEN

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:32.131
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IT SHOWS.

02:04:32.198 --> 02:04:34.967
OF SPRING DAY IN LA WHERE WE HAD

02:04:35.034 --> 02:04:37.469
FAIRLY LOW LOADS TWENTY SIX

02:04:37.536 --> 02:04:38.971
HUNDRED MEG BOMB MEGAWATT PEAK.

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:42.842
WE SERVED UP 74% OF OUR NEEDS

02:04:42.908 --> 02:04:44.210
THAT DAY WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY.

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:45.945
CONTRAST THAT WITH OF SLIGHT ON

02:04:46.011 --> 02:04:47.479
THE RIGHT WHERE WE HAD OUR PEAK

02:04:47.546 --> 02:04:49.415
DAY LAST SUMMER WE BEAT OUR

02:04:49.481 --> 02:04:51.584
PRIVATE PRE PRIOR PEAK BY OVER A

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:53.252
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS WE HAD SIXTY

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:54.320
FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT PEAK.

02:04:54.386 --> 02:04:57.089
ONLY 15% OF THE ENERGY SUPPLIED

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:59.158
THAT DAY WAS WITH RENEWABLES SO

02:04:59.225 --> 02:05:01.293
FOR THAT DAY TO SCALE UP 21100%

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.162
WOULD REQUIRE A FIVE FOLD

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.929
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

02:05:03.996 --> 02:05:05.497
RENEWABLES I JUST WENT THROUGH

02:05:05.564 --> 02:05:07.466
OUR PROJECT LISTING. TO GET TO A

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:09.435
100% BUT WHAT THAT DOES TO THE

02:05:09.501 --> 02:05:11.203
SPRING DAY.

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:13.339
THAT OVER PROCUREMENT IS

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:15.140
SIGNIFICANT TO HARM A LARGE

02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:16.976
AMOUNT OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:18.777
ONCE LIKE TWELVE WE HAD A NUMBER

02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:20.246
OF PEOPLE MEANT MENTIONED THE

02:05:20.312 --> 02:05:22.248
DOT CURVE TODAY SO THIS IS

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:24.783
ACTUALLY LA DWP IS LIEU DOCKER

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:25.384
MON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH OF THIS

02:05:25.451 --> 02:05:26.518
YEAR.

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.687
AND YOU CAN SEE YOU SEE VERY

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:29.955
WELL THAT GREEN DOC.

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:31.590
HE ALSO SEE THE HUMP BACK ON THE

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:33.259
DOCK I MENTIONED THE CASTAIC

02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:34.827
POWER PROG POP PUNK TIGER

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:36.362
PROJECT SO THAT'S WHEN WE HAD

02:05:36.428 --> 02:05:37.596
TOO MUCH ENERGY.

02:05:37.663 --> 02:05:39.732
AND WE USE THAT TO PUMP THROUGH

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:41.166
THE GENERATOR AND THE PUMP THE

02:05:41.233 --> 02:05:43.135
WATER UP TILL BUT YOU CAN ALSO

02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:45.170
SEE THE BLUE AREAS WE ACTUALLY

02:05:45.237 --> 02:05:47.539
USE THE GENERATORS --

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:48.674
TO TO HELP WITH THE DOCKER FOR

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:53.312
THE EVENING.

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.047
ON SLIDE THIRTEEN WE HAVE WHAT

02:05:55.114 --> 02:05:56.448
OUR TARGETS ARE IN OUR MOST

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.484
RECENT STRATEGIC LONG TERM

02:05:58.550 --> 02:06:00.986
RESOURCE PLAN WHAT ARE OUR

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:02.221
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

02:06:02.288 --> 02:06:04.390
GOALS FAR AS WELL AS LAST

02:06:04.456 --> 02:06:05.357
TUESDAY.

02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:07.026
OUR BOARD APPROVED A MORE

02:06:07.092 --> 02:06:09.662
AGGRESSIVE PLAN AND A 5% TO EACH

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.196
THE TARGETS OF THE SCENARIO IN

02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:12.298
OUR NEXT.

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:14.300
LONG TERM STRATEGIC LONG TERM

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:15.768
RESOURCE PLAN THAT WILL KICK OFF.

02:06:15.834 --> 02:06:18.270
ON NEXT YEAR MOVING ANDI'S

02:06:18.337 --> 02:06:19.238
FOURTEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:21.440
BARRIERS WE HAVE TO HIGH LEVELS

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:23.776
OF RENEWABLE IS TRANSMISSION.

02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:25.210
THAT FIRST SLIDE WE TALKED ABOUT

02:06:25.277 --> 02:06:27.012
THE TRANSMISSION THE LA HOUSE

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:28.681
OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MECHAS

02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.816
MILES OF TRANSMISSION.

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.251
WE HAVE TWO MAIN ARTERIES TO

02:06:32.318 --> 02:06:33.352
BRING IN.

02:06:33.419 --> 02:06:34.987
RESOURCES --

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:38.257
SO ARE WE LOOK TO LOCATE

02:06:38.324 --> 02:06:40.426
RENEWABLES IN THOSE SPECIFIC

02:06:40.492 --> 02:06:42.995
AREAS BUT AS IMPORTANT PERHAPS

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:44.897
MORE IMPORTANT TO BRING IT TO LA

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.632
WE HAVE A HUNDRED YEAR OLD

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:49.068
SYSTEM ON A GRID THAT WAS NOT.

02:06:49.134 --> 02:06:50.469
BUILT FOR TODAY'S ADVANCED

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:51.870
TECHNOLOGY SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:06:51.937 --> 02:06:53.872
DOWNSTREAM UPGRADES THAT ALSO

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:55.240
NEED TO BE --

02:06:55.307 --> 02:06:57.076
IMPLEMENTED BEFORE WE CAN REALLY

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.510
REACH HIGH LEVELS OF RENEWABLE

02:06:58.577 --> 02:07:00.713
SO INCREASING OR IMPROVING THE

02:07:00.779 --> 02:07:03.215
EFFICIENCY OF THE REGULATORY.

02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:05.985
ARM PROCESSES TO STREAMLINE

02:07:06.051 --> 02:07:07.152
TRANSMISSION WOULD BE EXTREMELY

02:07:07.219 --> 02:07:08.687
HELPFUL.

02:07:08.754 --> 02:07:10.422
ON SLIDE FIFTEEN THESE OR SOME

02:07:10.489 --> 02:07:11.623
OF THE RESOURCES WE LOOKED CARE

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:12.791
WHEN WE LOOK AT THROUGH THE

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.159
WESTERN STATES AND WHERE WE HAVE

02:07:14.226 --> 02:07:15.928
TRANSMISSION OR WHAT'S.

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:17.196
WHAT'S POSSIBLE WHEN THE AND

02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:20.032
THERE IS AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY.

02:07:20.099 --> 02:07:22.901
OF DEVELOPER CAPABILITY AND

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:25.404
PROJECTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE --

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:26.705
TO AT LEAST FOR LA'S PERSPECTIVE

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:28.607
ON IN THESE SPECIFIC AREAS SO WE

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:30.309
DON'T SEE A BARRIER OTHER THAN

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:31.944
TRANSMISSION OF BEING ABLE TO

02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:34.179
INCREASE HIGHER LEVELS.

02:07:34.246 --> 02:07:36.148
ON SLIDE ELEVEN ONE OF THE AREAS

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:37.416
THAT WE SEE IMPROVING ALL

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:40.085
CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS DWP IS THE

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:42.121
ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET THIS

02:07:42.187 --> 02:07:42.788
MARKET --

02:07:42.855 --> 02:07:45.124
PROVIDES EXCEPTIONAL BENEFITS

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:47.393
AND IN TERMS OF D. CARBON ICING

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:48.460
THE GRID --

02:07:48.527 --> 02:07:51.230
<u>&lt;c.green&gt; I AM OFFER.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:53.032
REDUCE THE INTEGRATION COSTS

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:55.367
REDUCE THE RATE CURTAIL MAN'S

02:07:55.434 --> 02:07:58.037
IT'S MORE EFFICIENT DISPATCH OF

02:07:58.103 --> 02:07:58.871
RESOURCES ON WIRED WIDER

02:07:58.937 --> 02:08:01.106
FOOTPRINT REDUCING GREENHOUSE

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:02.341
GASES INCREASING.

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:04.910
FLEXIBILITY BUT IMPORTANTLY IT'S

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:06.645
A VOLUNTARY MARKET FOR

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:09.481
PARTICIPATION FOR OTHER IT UP

02:08:09.548 --> 02:08:10.649
ENTITIES NOT IN A CRISIS.

02:08:10.716 --> 02:08:12.317
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:13.852
IS ONE OF THE ANOTHER UNIQUE

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:16.021
THING THAT IS HAPPENING IN LA.

02:08:16.088 --> 02:08:17.856
WE HAVE LIKE I MENTIONED FOUR

02:08:17.923 --> 02:08:21.126
MILLION ANGELENOS. 40% OF THOSE

02:08:21.193 --> 02:08:22.661
ARE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMIT THE

02:08:22.728 --> 02:08:23.996
COMMUNITIES OR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:08:24.063 --> 02:08:26.031
JUSTICE COMMUNITIES SO THIS IS

02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:27.132
THE WAY THIS IS CALLED OUR

02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:29.001
EQUITY METRICS DATA INITIATIVE

02:08:29.068 --> 02:08:30.502
MINUTES AWAY FOR PROGRAM

02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:31.570
MANAGERS.

02:08:31.637 --> 02:08:34.740
AND POLICY MAKERS TO ASSESS HOW

02:08:34.807 --> 02:08:37.342
DWP IS MEETING THE CONSTITUENT

02:08:37.409 --> 02:08:38.744
NEEDS OF ENTIRE SURFACE

02:08:38.811 --> 02:08:40.612
TERRITORY SO YOU CAN PUT THIS ON

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:40.979
IT.

02:08:41.046 --> 02:08:43.215
INCOME SCREEN YOU CAN PUT IT ON

02:08:43.282 --> 02:08:44.650
ZIP CODE SCREEN.

02:08:44.716 --> 02:08:46.218
IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE WE LOOKED

02:08:46.285 --> 02:08:47.753
AT OUR SOLAR INCENTIVE PROGRAM

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:49.955
SO IF IT'S THE SOLAR INTENSITY

02:08:50.022 --> 02:08:51.523
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:52.591
KILOWATTS.

02:08:52.658 --> 02:08:54.560
IN A SPECIFIC ZIP CODE DIVIDED

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:55.861
BY THE NUMBER REST FOR ALL

02:08:55.928 --> 02:08:58.464
RESIDENTS IT'LL TELL YOU HOW

02:08:58.530 --> 02:08:59.531
MUCH SOLAR IS --

02:08:59.598 --> 02:09:00.999
PENETRATED THAT AREA YOU CAN SEE

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.234
ON THE WEST SIDE THERE'S A LOT

02:09:02.301 --> 02:09:04.236
OF SOLAR BUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:05.370
WHERE ARE EACH DAY AND

02:09:05.437 --> 02:09:08.073
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE.

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:09.341
VERY TOUGH TO REACH

02:09:09.408 --> 02:09:12.344
CONSTITUENCIES A CONSTITUENCY SO

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:14.079
IF SOMETHING WERE --

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:16.048
FOCUSED ON BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:18.584
ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM TODAY.

02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:20.152
POLICIES WERE MAKING FROM AN

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:21.720
ENERGY PERSPECTIVE THEY'RE NOT

02:09:21.787 --> 02:09:23.689
GOING TO IMPACT WHETHER OR NOT

02:09:23.755 --> 02:09:25.090
WE CAN PAY OUR BILLS WHETHER OR

02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:26.525
NOT WE GO OUT TO DINNER.

02:09:26.592 --> 02:09:28.727
NEXTMONTH BUT THAT SINGLE

02:09:28.794 --> 02:09:30.162
MOTHER IN BOYLE HEIGHTS THAT'S

02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:32.131
WORKING THREE JOBS TO JUST MAKE

02:09:32.197 --> 02:09:33.899
SURE SHE DOESN'T EXPAND THE

02:09:33.966 --> 02:09:35.701
HOMELESS POPULATION.

02:09:35.767 --> 02:09:38.103
DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY ARE VERY

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:40.672
IMPACTFUL SO TO BE ABLE TO DO.

02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:42.508
ARE PLANNING.

02:09:42.574 --> 02:09:45.043
WITH STABILITY BUT FLEXIBILITY

02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:47.513
WHERE WE KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS

02:09:47.579 --> 02:09:48.413
AND LETTING US GET THERE IN THE

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.748
MOST.

02:09:49.815 --> 02:09:51.383
EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:53.485
THESE CONSTITUENTS IT IS

02:09:53.552 --> 02:09:58.123
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

02:09:58.190 --> 02:10:00.025
FINALLY WHERE ARE WE FROM A

02:10:00.092 --> 02:10:01.760
GREENHOUSE GAS PERSPECTIVE.

02:10:01.827 --> 02:10:04.796
WHEN WE LOOK AT --

02:10:04.863 --> 02:10:06.231
CALIFORNIA'S GOAL THE 40% BE

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:08.534
BELOW TWENTY THIRTY WE HIT THAT

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:09.168
FOURTEEN YEARS EARLY WE HIT THAT

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:10.502
LAST YEAR.

02:10:10.569 --> 02:10:12.604
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEXT GOLD

02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:16.175
80% BELOW?

02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:16.742
TWENTY FIFTY YOU CAN SEE THE

02:10:16.808 --> 02:10:18.076
BOTTOM LINE THE BROWN DOTTED

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:20.045
LINE THAT'S THE GOAL AND YOU CAN

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:22.114
SEE BY.

02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:24.116
WE ANTICIPATE HITTING THAT GOAL

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:26.084
AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS EARLIER

02:10:26.151 --> 02:10:27.386
THAN WHAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO WE

02:10:27.452 --> 02:10:28.954
THINK WE WILL HIT THAT WE'RE IN

02:10:29.021 --> 02:10:30.389
THE PROCESS NOW REDUCING MESS.

02:10:30.455 --> 02:10:33.792
SO WE THINK WE WILL HIT THAT BY.

02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:34.426
TWENTY THIRTY I HAVE A COUPLE

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:36.061
MORE SLIDES A TALK ABOUT SOME OF

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:37.696
THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SO ARE

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:39.331
PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE DOING TO

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:40.832
SPECIFICALLY TARGET THOSE

02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:42.568
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:44.369
AND EQUALLY APPLY OUR BENEFITS

02:10:44.436 --> 02:10:46.271
THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY

02:10:46.338 --> 02:10:49.074
STAKEHOLDERS AND WITHOUT IP IF

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:50.709
ON IT.

02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:51.343
HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:54.880
HAVE.

02:10:54.947 --> 02:10:56.114
GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR

02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:57.616
INVITING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:59.084
MY NAME'S MELISSA BRANTON I'M

02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:00.986
WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:02.688
WHICH IS A COMMUNITY CHOICE

02:11:02.754 --> 02:11:05.357
AGGREGATOR OR CC A SO I WANTED

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:06.291
TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE KEY

02:11:06.358 --> 02:11:07.993
TAKEAWAY UP FRONT FOR MY

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.595
PRESENTATION TODAY AND THAT IS

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:09.795
THAT.

02:11:09.861 --> 02:11:12.264
CCA'S ARE A TOOL IN THE STATE'S

02:11:12.331 --> 02:11:13.966
TOOLKIT AS IT CONTINUES DOWN THE

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:16.235
PATH TO D. CARBONIZATION AND IN

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:17.869
FACT THEY GO A STEP FURTHER AND

02:11:17.936 --> 02:11:19.805
SAY CCA'S ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART

02:11:19.871 --> 02:11:21.106
OF THIS TRANSITION TO A CARBON

02:11:21.173 --> 02:11:22.174
FREE STATE.

02:11:22.241 --> 02:11:23.508
AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:25.043
WITH BOTH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:11:25.110 --> 02:11:26.912
AS WELL AS WITH THE STATE TO

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:28.580
ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEET OUR

02:11:28.647 --> 02:11:30.115
CLIMATE GOALS TOGETHER.

02:11:30.182 --> 02:11:32.251
SO AB THIRTY TWO SPECIFICALLY

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:34.286
REQUIRED THE A A RP TO IDENTIFY

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:35.787
OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTARY

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.656
ACTION TO LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:39.191
EMISSIONS.

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:41.293
SUBSEQUENT ARB SCOPING PLANS

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.594
HAVE CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFIED

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:44.463
VOLUNTARY ACTION BY LOCAL

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:46.231
GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES TO

02:11:46.298 --> 02:11:48.400
DE CARBONIZED AS ESSENTIAL TO

02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:49.501
OUR CHURCH ACHIEVING OUR

02:11:49.568 --> 02:11:51.069
COLLECTIVE GOALS.

02:11:51.136 --> 02:11:52.304
AND SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:54.206
FORMED CCA'SAS THE WAY TO

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:55.674
COMPLY WITH THEIR AGGRESSIVE

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:58.076
CLIMATE ACTION PLANS CCA'S HAVE

02:11:58.143 --> 02:11:59.311
REALLY BEEN THE VEHICLE THROUGH

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:00.512
WHICH OUR LOCAL CITIES AND

02:12:00.579 --> 02:12:02.014
COUNTIES CAN ACHIEVE THOSE

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.049
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS.

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:05.083
AND THEY'VE DONE THIS THROUGH A

02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:07.786
FEW DIFFERENT MECHANISMS ONE IS

02:12:07.853 --> 02:12:10.322
DEFAULT ENERGY SUPPLY OFFERINGS

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:12.457
THAT HAVE HIGHER RENEWABLES.

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:14.559
AND HIGHER CHICHI FREE ENERGY

02:12:14.626 --> 02:12:15.994
CONTENT WELL AHEAD OF STATE

02:12:16.061 --> 02:12:17.829
MANDATES --

02:12:17.896 --> 02:12:19.531
A SECOND IS DEVELOPMENT OF

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:21.066
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:22.634
PROGRAMS TO INCREASE ADOPTION OF

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:24.436
E. VIS.

02:12:24.503 --> 02:12:26.438
THIRD DEVELOPMENT OF BUILDING

02:12:26.505 --> 02:12:28.240
ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMS TO GET

02:12:28.307 --> 02:12:29.041
DE CARBONIZED THE BUILT

02:12:29.107 --> 02:12:30.609
ENVIRONMENT.

02:12:30.676 --> 02:12:32.444
AND FOURTH DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY

02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:34.112
EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THAT FILL

02:12:34.179 --> 02:12:36.048
GAPS IN BROADER UTILITY ENERGY

02:12:36.114 --> 02:12:38.483
EFFICIENCY PROGRAM OFFERINGS.

02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:39.518
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:41.086
UNDERSTAND HOW IS HE CA IS

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:42.954
GOVERNED IN THE CONTEXT OF

02:12:43.021 --> 02:12:45.290
MEASURING SUCCESSES IN RESULTS

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:47.359
CCA GOVERNANCE IS SIMILAR TO

02:12:47.426 --> 02:12:49.494
THAT OF A PUBLIC OWN UTILITY.

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:50.829
BOARDS OF A LOCAL ELECTED

02:12:50.896 --> 02:12:52.331
OFFICIALS GOVERN OTHER CRITICAL

02:12:52.397 --> 02:12:54.566
INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS BRIDGES

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:55.767
WATER SYSTEMS PORTS

02:12:55.834 --> 02:12:57.402
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND

02:12:57.469 --> 02:12:58.470
THEY'RE WELL EQUIPPED TO GOVERN

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.005
THE SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AS

02:13:00.072 --> 02:13:00.906
WELL.

02:13:00.972 --> 02:13:02.874
WE ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH OPEN

02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:04.242
TRANSPARENT DECISION MAKING

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:06.244
CONDUCTED AND PUBLIC MEETINGS

02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:07.012
AND SUBJECT TO PUBLIC

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:08.847
PARTICIPATION.

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:11.316
SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO EAST

02:13:11.383 --> 02:13:13.485
BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY AS WE ARE A

02:13:13.552 --> 02:13:15.287
JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY SET UP TO

02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:17.322
SUPPLY ELECTRICITY TO ALAMEDA

02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:19.291
COUNTY AND ELEVEN OF ITS MEMBER

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:19.858
CITIES.

02:13:19.925 --> 02:13:21.360
AND AT FULL LAUNCH WILL HAVE

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:22.294

RESIDENTIAL LAUNCH.

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:08.407
I WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE CLAIM

02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:09.975
THAT MISTER FRIEDMAN SAID IN THE

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:11.410
LAST PANEL WHICH WAS THAT THE

CLAIMS OF CARBON FREE OR CARBON

02:14:14.413 --> 02:14:16.615
REDUCE PRODUCTS ARE UNVERIFIABLE.

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:17.716
WE WOULD SAY ACTUALLY THEY ARE

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:19.751
VERIFIABLE AND WE'RE LOOKING TO

02:14:19.818 --> 02:14:21.453

AT EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

02:14:35.567 --> 02:14:36.868
TOWARDS DE CARBONIZATION.

02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:38.370
ALTHOUGH WE ONLY LAUNCHED IN

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:39.805
JUNE WE'VE ALREADY LAUNCHED A

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:41.440
DEMAND RESPONSE PILOT WHICH

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:02.147
THAT ALLOWS US --

02:17:02.213 --> 02:17:03.815
TO FIND EARLY ACTION INITIATIVES

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:05.517

MORE THAN TEN YEARS.

02:17:51.329 --> 02:17:53.064
SO CONTRARY TO CLAIMS THAT MAY

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:54.566
HAVE BEEN MADE EARLIER CCA'S ARE

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:55.300

IN LONG TERM CONTRACTS TO CREATE

02:17:59.137 --> 02:18:00.905
NEW RENEWABLE GENERATION.

02:18:00.972 --> 02:18:02.674
IT'S HISTORICALLY TAKEN ABOUT

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:03.475
THREE TO FOUR YEARS FOR AN

02:18:03.541 --> 02:18:05.110

DIVERSE AND LONG TERM PORTFOLIO.

02:18:07.412 --> 02:18:08.279
BUT THIS TIME FRAME IS

02:18:08.346 --> 02:18:10.048
ACCELERATING.

02:18:10.115 --> 02:18:10.915
AND WE'RE IN A TIME OF

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:11.683
TRANSITION WHERE THERE'S AN

02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:13.785
UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF NEW

02:18:13.852 --> 02:18:14.953

LAUNCHED DURING THE PROCESS OF

02:18:16.588 --> 02:18:17.022
FORMING.

02:18:17.088 --> 02:18:18.823
IT'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY

02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:20.125
FOR THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF D.

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.426
CARBONIZATION.

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:22.761
WE'RE SEEKING THIS PARTNER WAS

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:23.962
STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL

02:18:24.029 --> 02:18:25.797
GOVERNMENTS AND PROMOTING THE

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:26.665
TRANSITION TO BUILDING

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:28.633
ELECTRIFICATION WERE WORKING

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:29.267
WITH OUR OWN LOCAL

ELECTRIFICATION.

02:18:33.638 --> 02:18:34.606
AND WE'VE REALLY BECOME AN

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:37.208
ENERGY HUB FOR POLICY WE ARE THE

02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:38.977
EXPERTS THAT CAN BRIDGE BETWEEN

02:18:39.044 --> 02:18:40.979
OUR LOCALITIES AND THEIR LOCAL

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:42.313
INITIATIVES IN FUNDING.

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:44.115
AND THE STATE AGENCIES AS THEY

02:18:44.182 --> 02:18:45.150
SEEK TO IMPLEMENT STATE CLIMATE

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:47.585
GOALS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT RE

02:18:47.652 --> 02:18:48.920
DESIGNED AS A TOOL THAT CAN HELP

02:18:48.987 --> 02:18:50.955
SHIFT CUSTOMER LOAD AND REDUCE

02:18:51.022 --> 02:18:53.658
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:55.026
I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT SEE

02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:56.828
SEIZE ARE NIMBLE AND WE CAN MOVE

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.797
FAST TO RESPOND AND PUSH THE

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:00.765
ENVELOPE ON D. CARBONIZATION

02:19:00.832 --> 02:19:01.466

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:02.967
THROUGH NEW PILOTS NEW

02:19:03.034 --> 02:19:05.036
TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT WE CAN

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:07.138
BRING PROGRAMS TO SCALE WE DON'T

02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:08.473
HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LONG AND

02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:10.241
COMPLEX REGULATORY PROCESS TO

BUILDING UPON AND SOME OF THE

02:29:44.642 --> 02:29:46.744
COMMENTS THAT MR CALLACE MADE

P. GENIES SUPPORT --

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:54.151
FOR THE METHODOLOGY THAT THE PC

02:29:54.218 --> 02:29:55.720
ADOPTED OF THAT I'M NOT SURE

02:29:55.786 --> 02:29:56.754
WHAT SPECIFICALLY COVERED MAYBE

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:57.988
JUST.

AND BASICALLY YOU ACCOUNT --

02:30:08.265 --> 02:30:10.568
FOR THINGS MORE AN HOURLY LEVEL

02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:11.602
THINK WE KNOW THINGS ARE

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:12.937
HAPPENING MORE MID DAY THAT ARE

02:30:13.003 --> 02:30:13.804
DIFFERENT.

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:14.805
THAN WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING THE

SOMETHING THAT --

02:30:18.743 --> 02:30:19.210
WE THINK SHOULD BE ADOPTED

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:24.215
STATEWIDE.

TO TO TURN BACK ON MR KASS IS

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:29.954
REMARKS.

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:32.089
COLLEAGUE FROM THE COACHELLA.

02:30:32.156 --> 02:30:33.724
I ADAM SMITH'S THE CALIFORNIA'S

02:30:33.791 --> 02:30:35.092
AND THANKS FOR THE CHANCE TO

02:30:35.159 --> 02:30:37.027
THAT ON TO KEN'S COMMENTS I I'D

02:30:37.094 --> 02:30:38.229
PLAY ACTUALLY GREW THE VALLEY

02:30:38.295 --> 02:30:39.130
THINK THAT CAN LEAD OTHER.

02:30:39.196 --> 02:30:40.931
A PRETTY GOOD CASE OF THE KIND

02:30:40.998 --> 02:30:42.099
OF UTILITY POSITION ON THE

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:44.468
FUTURE OF PROCUREMENT ELISE FOR

02:30:44.535 --> 02:30:46.036
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AYE I

02:30:46.103 --> 02:30:47.004
WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT CLEAN

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:48.773
THAT SHORT METHODOLOGY SOMETHING

02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:50.574
THAT S. E. SUPPORTS AS WELL.

02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:52.209
AND FRANKLY WORKED ON IT A

02:30:52.276 --> 02:30:53.711
LITTLE BIT AND I THINK IT DOES

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:55.312
PRESENT A MUCH MORE ROBUST

02:30:55.379 --> 02:30:57.348
VISION FOR OUR REGULATORS AND

02:30:57.415 --> 02:30:58.582
YOU FOR CUSTOMERS AT SUCH AS

02:30:58.649 --> 02:30:59.817
THAT ONE MORE TIME.

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:00.918
YEAH YEAH SO THE CLEANUP SHORT

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:01.886
METHODOLOGY BASICALLY TAKES A

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:04.555
LOOK AT KIND OF THE RESOURCE

02:31:04.622 --> 02:31:05.556
HAPPENS IT'S BECOME A KIND OF

02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:06.624
TAKES A LOOK AT ALL THE

02:31:06.690 --> 02:31:08.192
CONTRACTED RESOURCES WHICH YOU

02:31:08.259 --> 02:31:08.959
HAVE IN YOUR PORTFOLIO.

02:31:09.026 --> 02:31:10.928
IMAGINE HOURLY DEMAND IS

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:13.197
MEGAWATTS --

02:31:13.264 --> 02:31:15.199
YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONTRACTS ON ON

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:17.001
THE BOOKS FOR YOU KNOW SOME

02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:19.503
PROPORTION OF THAT X. MEGAWATTS.

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:22.039
IN ANY GIVEN OUR AND THEN WE ARE

02:31:22.106 --> 02:31:23.808
RELYING UPON MARKET POWER SPOT

02:31:23.874 --> 02:31:26.110
MARKET PURCHASES TO KIND FILL

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:28.212
THE GAP THERE SO THE IDEA IS YOU

02:31:28.279 --> 02:31:29.013
KNOW.

02:31:29.079 --> 02:31:30.114
YOU NEED LOOK AT ALL THAT NIGHT

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:31.949
RENEWABLE RESOURCES WHICH WE ARE

02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:33.417
CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH

02:31:33.484 --> 02:31:34.919
ANY KIND OF FOR YOU KNOW OTHER

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:36.387
ENTITIES KIND OF NATURAL GAS

02:31:36.454 --> 02:31:38.055
CONTRACTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE.

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:39.123
AND THE YOU DETERMINE HOW MUCH

02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:41.125
IS SORT OF LEFT OVER AND THOSE

02:31:41.192 --> 02:31:43.294
LEFT OVER SPOT MARKET PURCHASES

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:44.862
ARE USUALLY ASSIGNED EMISSIONS

02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:46.831
INTENSITY BASED ON KIND OF A

02:31:46.897 --> 02:31:48.666
WIDE RANGING DATA ANALYSIS TO

02:31:48.732 --> 02:31:50.401
COME UP WITH KIND OF AN AVERAGE.

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:52.603
SO MEAN THAT THE IN OUR VIEW

02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:53.938
ACTUALLY DOES IT'S OF THE KIND

02:31:54.004 --> 02:31:55.739
OF CURRENT METHODOLOGIES THEIR

02:31:55.806 --> 02:31:57.675
THEIR EXISTING EITHER THE SEE

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:59.009
YOU SEE YOU ARE THE THE PC OR A

02:31:59.076 --> 02:31:59.944
A RP.

02:32:00.010 --> 02:32:00.611
WE THINK THAT THIS IS KIND OF A

02:32:00.678 --> 02:32:01.912
STEP FORWARD IN GETTING MUCH

02:32:01.979 --> 02:32:04.815
MORE GRANULAR AND FOCUS ON THE

02:32:04.882 --> 02:32:07.351
HOUR SO THIS IS THE STEP BEFORE.

02:32:07.418 --> 02:32:10.554
SHORT WOULD ACTUALLY GENERATE.

02:32:10.621 --> 02:32:11.956
SORT OF A MORE GRANULAR LOOK AT

02:32:12.022 --> 02:32:13.624
WHAT.

02:32:13.691 --> 02:32:15.192
SYSTEM POWER MIGHT THINK YOU'RE

02:32:15.259 --> 02:32:17.061
BACKING OUT OF WHAT YOU'RE

02:32:17.127 --> 02:32:20.898
CONTRACTED FOR AND YEAH DIDN'T

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:22.500
THAT THIS THEIR SLIGHT THEY'RE

02:32:22.566 --> 02:32:24.235
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE GF

02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:25.002
SHE PRICE SATTAR.

02:32:25.069 --> 02:32:26.804
ENERGY MARKETS IS SORT OF THE

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:28.572
THE BAKED IN ASSUMPTION WE ALL

02:32:28.639 --> 02:32:30.741
MAKE ABOUT THE COST OF GHGS

02:32:30.808 --> 02:32:31.942
BASED ON THE CAP AND TRADE

02:32:32.009 --> 02:32:33.344
ALLOWANCE PRICE YOU KNOW WHAT

02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:35.012
THE CURRENT MARKET DYNAMICS SUCK.

02:32:35.079 --> 02:32:36.480
THIS GST PRICE OTHER --

02:32:36.547 --> 02:32:38.682
THAT KIND OF OBVIOUSLY INFORMS

02:32:38.749 --> 02:32:39.817
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF

02:32:39.884 --> 02:32:41.852
REMAINING SHARE THAT WE GO TO

02:32:41.919 --> 02:32:44.388
THE MARKET AND AND PURCHASE A IF

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:45.356
THAT MAKES SENSE THROUGH THE

02:32:45.422 --> 02:32:46.357
CLEAN TRAUMA THE DODGY.

02:32:46.423 --> 02:32:47.258
RUN TO ALL THE CONTRACTS THERE'S

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:49.093
KIND OF THIS LEFTOVER GAP OF THE

02:32:49.159 --> 02:32:50.728
SPOT MARKET PURCHASES WITHIN

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:52.897
THAT GAP THERE IS THIS GHG PRICE

02:32:52.963 --> 02:32:53.597
OUT OR THAT.

02:32:53.664 --> 02:32:56.066
YOU KNOW ARE THE KIND OF ASSUMED

02:32:56.133 --> 02:32:56.700
CARBON MARKETPRICE THAT'S BUILT

02:32:56.767 --> 02:32:57.501
IN.

02:32:57.568 --> 02:32:58.402
AND AND THAT KIND OF HOPES

02:32:58.469 --> 02:33:00.170
DICTATE WHICH RESOURCES IN THAT

02:33:00.237 --> 02:33:02.306
REMAINING STACKER ECONOMIC OR

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:07.311
NOT.

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:07.511
WELL.

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:08.312
PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA

02:33:08.379 --> 02:33:09.713
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:11.749
WE REPRESENT OVER --

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:12.316
FORTY PUBLICLY AND ELECTRIC

02:33:12.383 --> 02:33:15.152
UTILITIES ROUND STATE P..

02:33:15.219 --> 02:33:16.554
THINK MISTER SMITH JUST A REALLY

02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:17.421
GOOD JOB --

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:18.656
DESCRIBING CLEAN NOT SURE BUT I

02:33:18.722 --> 02:33:20.524
THINK YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS

02:33:20.591 --> 02:33:22.192
ABOUT PROCUREMENT IF I'M CORRECT.

02:33:22.259 --> 02:33:23.727
AND SO --

02:33:23.794 --> 02:33:25.296
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES VARY IN

02:33:25.362 --> 02:33:26.897
SIZE AROUND THE STATE'S A ONE

02:33:26.964 --> 02:33:27.765
THING THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR

02:33:27.831 --> 02:33:29.266
MEMBERS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:33:29.333 --> 02:33:31.201
FOR THEM IS FLEXIBILITY --

02:33:31.268 --> 02:33:33.037
LADWP HAS OVER A MILLION

02:33:33.103 --> 02:33:34.572
CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS --

02:33:34.638 --> 02:33:36.040
SOME OF OUR MAYOR AGENCIES HAVE

02:33:36.106 --> 02:33:38.442
ONLY A FEW THOUSAND AND G.

02:33:38.509 --> 02:33:39.910
GEOGRAPHY ALSO MAKES A REALLY

02:33:39.977 --> 02:33:41.312
BIG DIFFERENCE SO WHAT MAY WORK

02:33:41.378 --> 02:33:42.947
IN LA MAY NOT WORK IN THE

02:33:43.013 --> 02:33:44.481
CENTRAL VALLEY --

02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:47.785
ALSO LOAD SIZES A OBVIOUSLY WILK

02:33:47.851 --> 02:33:49.787
A IN SOME WAYS DICTATE WHAT DOES

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:51.722
PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES ARE FOR

02:33:51.789 --> 02:33:53.290
SMALLER PEER USE THEY MAY RELY

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:55.659
ON ONE OR TWO CUSTOMERS.

02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:57.962
AND I SAID THEY WILL PROCURE AN

02:33:58.028 --> 02:33:59.330
AND BASE OUR PORTFOLIO AROUND

02:33:59.396 --> 02:34:01.565
THAT WERE AS FOR OF APPEAL YOU

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:02.566
LIKE -- LATV

02:34:02.633 --> 02:34:04.168
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH SIGNIFICANT A

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:05.669
BIGGER LOAD THE HABITAT FOR

02:34:05.736 --> 02:34:07.972
PROCUREMENT STRATEGY AYE SO --

02:34:08.038 --> 02:34:09.506
THERE ARE DIFFERING PERSPECTIVES

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:10.608
AROUND STATE AMONG THE PEW

02:34:10.674 --> 02:34:13.777
COMMUNITY ABOUT --

02:34:13.844 --> 02:34:15.646
PROCUREMENT BUT THAT'S BASED ON

02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:18.015
THERE LOW PROFILE.

02:34:18.082 --> 02:34:20.384
AND SO FLEXIBILITY IS REALLY KEY

02:34:20.451 --> 02:34:21.986
AT LEAST FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP WHEN

02:34:22.052 --> 02:34:24.088
IMPLEMENTING RULES --

02:34:24.154 --> 02:34:25.689
AND AND REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT

02:34:25.756 --> 02:34:27.391
COMES TO PROCUREMENT.

02:34:27.458 --> 02:34:30.160
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH A WITH THIS

02:34:30.227 --> 02:34:32.262
PERSISTING NATURE AND COAL?

02:34:32.329 --> 02:34:33.797
I MEAN I I KNOW DWP HAD A LOT OF

02:34:33.864 --> 02:34:34.832
MAY ORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE PAST

02:34:34.898 --> 02:34:36.900
WHERE THE MADE COMMITMENTS AND

02:34:36.967 --> 02:34:38.202
THEY'VE SORT OF SET THEIR SIGHTS

02:34:38.268 --> 02:34:39.637
ON ANY OF THE BALANCE SHEET

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:41.238
WHERE THEY CAN GO AND WORK ON

02:34:41.305 --> 02:34:41.805
THAT BUT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH

02:34:41.872 --> 02:34:42.773
THAT WITH.

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:44.174
SOME OF THE OTHER MUNICIPAL

02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:44.775
UTILITIES OUT THERE THAT SEEM

02:34:44.842 --> 02:34:45.075
[inaudible]

02:34:45.142 --> 02:34:46.844
TO JUST.

02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:48.412
STICKS WITH THEM AND I GET THE

02:34:48.479 --> 02:34:49.813
FLEXIBILITY POINT BUT I'M IT

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.248
IT'S MY NURSING THAT CALL

02:34:51.315 --> 02:34:53.417
CONTRACTS ARE BEING PHASED OUT --

02:34:53.484 --> 02:34:55.152
THE THE LATEST I'VE HEARD IT OF

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:56.787
THE LATEST CONTRACT BEING PHASED

02:34:56.854 --> 02:34:57.955
OUT --

02:34:58.022 --> 02:34:59.590
MISSED IS --

02:34:59.657 --> 02:35:00.157
TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IT TAKES

02:35:00.224 --> 02:35:01.358
TIME TO GET OUT OF THOSE TYPES

02:35:50.374 --> 02:35:51.675
IF I CAN MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT

02:35:51.742 --> 02:35:52.876

LABEL GOES IN THE UNSPECIFIED

02:35:55.579 --> 02:35:57.448
SOURCE FROM THE HIGHER

02:35:57.514 --> 02:35:58.315
PERCENTAGE.

02:35:58.382 --> 02:36:01.418

HAVE.

02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:07.357
A COAL CONTRACT SEVEN MORE YEARS

02:36:07.424 --> 02:36:08.425
OF OUT -- WE

02:36:08.492 --> 02:36:11.428
PLAN TO BE OUT OF OUT BY TWENTY

02:36:11.495 --> 02:36:11.995
TWENTY FIVE BUT IF YOU CAN

02:36:12.062 --> 02:36:14.832
REDUCE YOUR CALL USAGE --

02:36:14.898 --> 02:36:15.999
ESPECIALLY DURING THE CHI SO

02:36:16.066 --> 02:36:17.000
WHEN YOU CAN USE THAT ON

02:36:17.067 --> 02:36:19.269

THE ARMY WOULD OVERALL REDUCE

02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:24.775
THE GREENHOUSE GAS --

02:36:24.842 --> 02:36:27.845
FOOTPRINT BY REDUCING COAL USAGE

02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:29.913
BUT USING UNSPECIFIED --

02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:32.783
THEORETICALLY IS CLOSE SOMETHING

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:35.486
LESS THAN WHAT UP CLOSE STRICTLY

02:36:35.552 --> 02:36:36.453
COAL.

02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:37.221
RESEARCH IN OTHER WORDS IF WE

02:36:37.287 --> 02:36:40.357

02:36:53.437 --> 02:36:55.639
RESOURCE WE MIGHT SEE.

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:58.275

MORE DIFFICULT CHICHI ACCOUNTING

02:38:39.209 --> 02:38:40.744
IS TO DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF
