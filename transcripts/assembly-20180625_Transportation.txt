O. -- ONE ONE ONE NINE THIS IS -- PRETTY MUCH A COMMON SENSE -- MEASURE -- IT IT -- REVISES EXISTING ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS -- WITHIN THE LOW CARBON TRANSIT OPERATIONS PROGRAM FOUND.

OR REDUCED TRANSIT FARES -- THERE ARE PARAMETERS IN THE STATUTE AROUND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY REQUIREMENTS -- ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED AND YOUR DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO SITUATIONS. WHERE THE INVESTMENT OF COURAGE DIRECTLY AND HOLY WITH IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY -- THIS RESTRAINS -- THESE TRANSIT FARES INTO IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T REALLY INTEND. BECAUSE WHAT WE WANTED DO IS GET ON THE BUS [inaudible] AND GO. TO OF SCHOOL.

THIRTEEN SIXTY I WANNA I THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF. SUBMIT SOME AMENDMENTS WHICH I BELIEVE WHEN IN ITS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND THERE BUT THEY WERE OF MOSTLY DUE TO THE DUE DILIGENCE OF YOUR STAFF SO THANK YOU TAKE -- THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW A PERSON WITH A DRIVER'S LICENSE FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO BE EXEMPT FROM TAKING THE BEHIND THE WHEEL EXEMPTION. WHEN APPLYING FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE? WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY COMES TO CALIFORNIA WITH PROPER DOCUMENTATION -- INCLUDING A DRIVER'S LICENSE HERE SHE HAS TO GET EITHER A CALIFORNIA ID FOR A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE AS SOON AS THE RESIDENTS HE IS DECLARED. OF THE PROCESS IN SELF CAN BE EXTREMELY ONEROUS THIS BILL TAKE SEVERAL STEPS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. WHILE ALLOWING FOREIGN NATIONALS TO HAVE THE DRIVING PORTION OF DMV'S EXAM WAVED THEY MUST STILL PASS THE WRITTEN EXAM AND TAKE THE VISUAL AND HEARING EXAMINATION THESE ARE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON HOW TO STATE DRIVERS TO ESTABLISH RESIDENCY IN CALIFORNIA. AND APPLY FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE FURTHER A FOREIGN COUNTRIES RESIDENTS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR DRIVING DAMNATION WAIVED IF THE AND THE HAS MADE A FINDING. THAT THAT FOREIGN COUNTRY. DRIVING EXAM IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO OURS -- SO BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO HAVE A SIMILAR PROGRAM AS OURS AND THAT HAS TO BE VERIFIED -- ALSO COUNTRY HAS A SIGN MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT THEY WILL PROVIDE THE SAME TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIA'S LICENSEES IN THEIR TERRITORIES. IF THE DMV HAS VERIFIED THAT A FOREIGN NATION HAS A STAT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR BEHIND THE WHEEL EXAMINATION. AN AMMO YOU HAS BEEN SIGNED DMB MUST THEN VERIFY THAT THERE ARE NO STOPS HOLDS OR OTHER IMPEDIMENTS. TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN APPLICANT'S EXISTING LICENSE BEFORE CAN BE CAN WAIVE THE BEHIND THE WHEEL. DMV MUST ALSO RECEIVE A COPY OF THE INDIVIDUALS DRIVING RECORD FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH AND A COPY OF HIS OR HER LICENSE TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH. AND BOTH MUST BE NOTARIZED BY THE COUNCIL WOULD GENERAL'S OFFICE OF THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IN CALIFORNIA. BY HAVING FIVE YEARS WORTH OF DRIVING HE WILL BE ABLE TO ASSESS ANY EQUIVALENT NEGLIGENT OPERATOR POINTS ONTO THAT INDIVIDUALS LICENSE. AS IF THEY HAD COMMITTED THE DRIVING OFFENSE IN CALIFORNIA. DMV ALSO DOES THIS FOR DRIVERS FROM OTHER STATES WHO HAVE EXCHANGE OUR LICENSE FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE IN ADDITION. WHILE. THE DRIVER FROM A FOREIGN NATION CAN SUMMIT COMMERCIAL OR NON COMMERCIAL CLASS A. B. OR C. LICENSES TABLER EXAMINATION WAIT THEY WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A NONCOMMERCIAL CLASS C. LICENSE. FINALLY THE LICENSE WILL HAVE TO STE THE LICENSEE WILL AFTER DRIVER'S LICENSE TO THE DMV. FOR DESTRUCTION -- FOR EXAMPLE -- KOREA HAS NEGOTIATED TWENTY THREE OF THESE AMMO USE WITH OTHER STATES INCLUDING ARIZONA AND TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT. WHAT THE COMMITTEE DOES IS MADE THIS EVEN TO APPLY TO ALL COUNTRIES WHICH I APPRECIATE OUT WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I HAVE LONG IN SONG WHO IS THE DEPUTY COUNSEL GENERAL? FROM THE COUNCIL OF OF OF REPUBLIKA KOREAN LOS ANGELES -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THOSE SOMEBODY MEMBERS CLIFTON ON BEHALF OF THE KOREAN GOVERNMENT AND COULD HAVE PEOPLE I THINK IT'S SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THIS TO BE SICK. PROCOL DRIVER'S LICENSE PROGRAM WILL BENEFIT. BOTH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SOUTH KOREA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. WHEN IT COMES TO KOREA CALIFORNIA RELATIONS SOUTH KOREA IS THE THIRD LARGEST TRADE BUTTON TO STATE OF CALIFORNIA? WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS INVITED FOR TRADE. AND THEY INVESTMENT FROM KOREA TO CALIFORNIA IS TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS CREATURE EVER CREATED TENS OF THOUSAND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THREE ACCORDING TO RECENT DATA SEVERAL UNDER THE FIFTY THOUSAND KOREANS AND KOREAN AMERICANS ARE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AND TEN THOUSAND CONTESTED UNTESTED HERE TO STUDY. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THAT BEATS PROCOL DRIVERS LICENSE PROGRAM. WILL GREATLY BENEFIT BOTH FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO INCLUDING SOUTH KOREA AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] FIRST. GIVEN THAT A DRIVER'S LICENSE IS THE FIRST THING TO DO FOR SETTLING DOWN. AS THE STATE REGION DOES THIS PROGRAM WILL MAKE TO SETTLE DOWN PROCESS EASIER AND FASTER. BY REDUCING TESTING BE QUIET. BUT THOSE WHO HAVE BADLY DRIVERS LICENSE FROM KOREA ADVICE WAS UP ALL CALIFORNIANS. AT THE SAME TIME -- DIFFICULTLY DOT RECIPROCAL PROGRAM ALSO BE JUST TIME AND COST FOR THE DMV FIELD OFFICERS. BECAUSE PEOPLE BROUGHT WITH BUT IT DRIVE RIGHT SINCE FROM SOUTH KOREA DON'T HAVE. TO GO TO ALL OF THE LICENSING PROCESS THIRDLY GIFTS RECIPROCAL PROGRAM. WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT SIGN OF CALIFORNIA'S OPENNESS AND FRIENDSHIP WITH SOUTH KOREA AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD. AND YOU DO PROMOTE TRADE AND INVESTMENT BY CREATING BEGINS FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT. IN CONGRESS AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAM. S. MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO KOREA AND OTHER FORTY COUNTRIES AND CALIFORNIA AND YOU DID YOU SPEND THAT. OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION I YES. SO I HOPE THAT DO SO STATE ALL CALIFORNIA WITH JOINT. THE OTHER TEN YOU TOOK THE STAGE INCLUDING. I JOIN IN WASHINGTON. AND THAT ALREADY HAVE SIMILARLY TO PRICKLE AGREEMENT WITH KOREA AS WITH ONE HUNDRED SUCH ONE COUNTRIES OR OF THE COUNTRY. UP TO WHAT THEY COULDN'T. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC STILL LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY OF ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION VOICE OUR OPINION OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER. HARPER LANDESMAN IS BAKER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] SHARE. SO I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT REPUBLICAN CAREER THIS THREAD GOT DOWN ON ON NATIONS THAT MAY FIT THE CRITERIA. ON THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT I HAVE ABOUT THE BILL HOWEVER I IS ABOUT THE ELIMINATION OF THE PROOF OF INSURANCE. I RIVER OF WALKING BY WATCHING THE DEBATE ABOUT SIXTY BY AB SIXTY AND IN THAT DEBATE ABOUT DRIVERS LICENSES FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS AND SUCH A BIG PART OF THE QUESTION -- WAS ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT DE WE GOT UNINSURED DRIVERS OFF THE ROAD MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE ARE QUALIFY PICTURES. SO IF YOU CAN KIND OF CLARIFY THE THIS ISSUE HERE ABOUT THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS OFF ON THIS IN OUR WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE POTENTIALLY ALLOWING -- UNINSURED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD NO THERE'S NO INTENTION TO ALLOW UNINSURED DRIVERS TO DRIVE ON THE ROADS. ACTORS THAT'S SO. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CLARIFICATION. SIMILARLY BAKER. THANK YOU AND THEM THANK YOU. FOR OF COMING AND TESTIFYING FIRST PLACE I WENT AWAY FROM I WAS A KID WAS. TO GRIP SOUTH KOREA SO I'M AND I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE THE CONNECTION YOU'RE TRYING. TO READ SHARE MY CONCERN IS YOU KNOW MY KIDS ARE GONNA BE ON THE ROAD AND ABOUT A YEAR AND I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT I I AM STEPS MUST BE EXCITED THAT THEY WILL DRIVE THEMSELVES PLACES BUT THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST IN PART OF THE PURPOSE. OF IT OF THE DRIVING TASK. AT THE WRITTEN OR WAVING. IS TO I THINK TO SEE HOW THEY WILL OPERATE UNDER REAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN REAL PRESSURE -- REALIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME COUNTRIES THAT DON'T DRIVE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT WE DO THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME RULES THREE TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS. LOOKS TO SEE IF THE TEST IS COMPARABLE. BUT NOT THE NECESSARILY THE SAME ACTUAL RULES OF THE OTHER COUNTRY -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE I I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY WE'RE NOT REQUIRING THE SAME RULES BE FOLLOWED. AND AND HOW I WOULD GET OVER THE CONCERN THAT SOMEONE WILL BE ON THE ROAD THE SAME ROAD THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE ON MY CONSTITUENTS. WHO HAS NOT TAKEN A REAL LIFE TEST HERE UNDER OUR RULES AND BILL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS? AND I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE THAT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE PERSON FROM KANSAS. OR FLORIDA OR SOUTH DAKOTA WHEN THEY COME HERE IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THAT WE TREAT THAT WE WOULD BE TREATING THEM -- THIS MEANS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS HAVE A VERIFIED BEHIND THE WHEEL PROGRAM SIMILAR TO OURS -- OTHER STATES HAVE DIFFERENT DRIVING RULES THOSE PEOPLE SOFT TAKE THE WRITTEN TEST. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. SAME WOULD APPLY HERE -- THESE FOLKS FROM WHATEVER COUNTRY THAT MEETS THE CRITERIA WOULD STILL HAVE TO TAKE THE WRITTEN TEST SO FOR EXAMPLE NOT EVERY STATE HAS RIGHT TURN ON RED -- DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT DRIVING LAWS WE DON'T WE DON'T LEVEL THIS ANY DIFFERENTLY IF YOU WERE FROM NEBRASKA. OR SOUTH DAKOTA SO WHICH TREATING THESE FOLKS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. I APPRECIATE THAT I I DO SEE A DIFFERENCE WE HAVE AT LEAST HAVE A UNIFORMITY. OF SIGNAGE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO OVER TO EUROPE YOU COVERAGE PAN YOU COULD EITHER COUNTRIES THE SCIENCE THE THE WAY THEY MARK THEIR LINES ON THE STREETS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND AGAIN THERE MAY BE DRIVING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD -- AND INTESTINE NOT THAT. BETWEEN ARE EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE FIFTY STATES AND AND WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. WHICH CONCERNS ME AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN CAN ADDRESS JUST WHAT. ARE MAYBE THAT WAS THAT THE EFFORT BUT WHAT. WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE SEE UNDER REAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SOMEONE IN THE REAL FIELD IN OUR AREA IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE SAFELY ON THE ROADS AND THAT'S WHERE THE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PROGRAM COMES INTO EFFECT -- D. M. V. WILL BE MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER COUNTRIES APPLYING FOR THIS MEETS OUR STANDARDS. THAT'S THE SAFEGUARD THEY HAVE TO MEET OUR STATE I PERSONALLY SPOKE IN THE EXAMPLE OF KOREA MET WITH THEIR TRAFFIC FOLKS PERSONALLY AND TALKED ABOUT. HOW THEY DO IT AND IT IS MODELED ON OUR PROGRAM SO? THAT'S THE SAFEGUARD HERE IS THEY HAVE TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WITH CALIFORNIA DOES -- TO GET THIS BENEFIT IF THEY DON'T AND IF THEY DON'T PROVIDE ALL OF THE DOCUMENTATION OF THEY DON'T. PROVIDE THEIR DRIVING RECORDS IF THEY DON'T PROVIDE WHICH INCLUDES THEIR ANY POINTS THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLE -- SO I THINK THE CRITERIA IS PRETTY STRONG AND STRINGENT AND SORT OF FOLLOWS OF LOGICAL. A ASSUMPTIONS -- AND AGAIN IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN. YOU KNOW NEBRASKA OR FLORIDA. AMANDA STILL THINK I GUESS IT IS DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU MAY HAVE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT FOUND. AND SIGNAGE RULES BUT THAT MAY JUST BE -- A FAIR POINT IF OF LOOKING AT IT DIFFERENTLY. AND THEN THAT IF YOU CAN ALSO IT CLARIFIER WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE LAWS AND TESTING IS THE SAME BUT THE THEIR THEIR TEST PROCEDURES. AND NOT THEIR ACTUAL RULES OF THE ROAD -- Y. THAT TREATING THOSE TWO DIFFERENTLY UNDER YOUR BILL BECAUSE I THINK THE POINT IS THAT NOT EVERY COUNTRY NOT EVERY STATE HAS EXACTLY THE SAME RULES OF THE ROAD THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THESE ARE COMPETENT. SAFE DRIVERS VERIFIED BY FIVE YEARS OF DRIVING HISTORY. VERIFIED BY THE TRAINING. TO A PROGRAM THAT'S COMPARABLE TO OURS. I MEAN YOU NEVER GONNA HAVE AN EXACT MATCH BUT THIS. PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY SAID THIS PROVIDES CONTROLS AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE CAME UP WITH WITH THAT DEFINITION. TO APPLY EVENLY THERE ARE GONNA BE COUNTRIES THAT JUST CANNOT APPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS. THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM NOT OURS BUT FOR THE COUNTRIES THAT MEET THE MINIMUM STANDARDS. AND SUPPLY ALL OF THIS DOCUMENTATION FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHEN YOU KNOW THE EIGHTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND HAS -- OF POPULATION OF OF FOREIGN NATIONALS AND A MYRIAD OF BUSINESSES THIS IS A WAY TO FACILITATE SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S TRADE IN FRIENDSHIP AND AN ESPRIT DE CORPS WITH THESE COUNTRIES THAT DO BUSINESS WITH US. IN A WAY THAT I THINK HAS A APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR FOLK. I JUST REAL QUICK AB IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING UNDER EXISTING LAW THE EXISTING SO AND THAT THE DMB VERIFIES -- DRIVERS PROOF OF INSURANCE -- BEFORE MISSION THE DRIVING TEST SO IF THE IF THE DRIVING TEST IS WAIVED WHERE IN THE PROCESS TO SOMEONE PROVE INSURANCE. WE CAN CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO INTENTION TO HAVE ANY INSURANCE BREAKS BE. HAPPENED I MEAN THAT'S YOU KNOW IF WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT AS THIS BILL PROGRESSES I MEAN I IT'S NOT. WE DON'T SEE THAT AS AN ISSUE. YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE THAT AS A AS A BARRIER NOT TO CLEAR UP IF IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH IN THE LEGISLATION I THINK THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT I THINK IS RIGHT WAS ABILITY TO DO THAT FUNDS. YEAH. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH AND WITH HAVING INSURANCE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR SEEING NONE -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL -- CENTER PORTANTINO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WELL WITH THE COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. AND TO GIVE THE DMV VIA ABILITY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF FOREIGN NATIONS. DRIVING'S AMINATION IS COMPATIBLE TO TO OUR OWN BEFORE WAVING THE EXAM.

ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE EXISTING LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE SECOND STICKER FOUR ZERO EMISSION CARS WHICH PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED ONE THIS BASICALLY ELIMINATES A USED. THAT OPTION IT IS UNFAIR FOR OUR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES -- IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN -- WHEN THE UC STUDY THIS ISSUE THE H. OF THE STICKER WAS THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT A NEW CLEAN VEHICLE? BUT IF YOU CAN ONLY GET THIS INCENTIVE WHAT THE NEW EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC CAR THAT HOW CAN LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S EVER HAVE ACCESS. I KNOW MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVE A CONCERNS ABOUT CONGESTION THE H. WILL BE LAID TONIGHT DIFF DEFINITELY RESPECT -- THAT ISSUE THAT IS WHY WE WE TOOK ON AMENDMENT TO CREATE -- TO DO A SUNSET ON THE IS ON THE BILL TO ALLOW US TO STUDY THE ISSUE -- IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD SURE THAT -- WHERE ALLOWING A MARKET TO BE ABLE OF GOING TO EXISTENCE WITH THE USE THAT VEHICLE TO ALLOW? OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE TICKERS AS WELL AND SO THE SUNSET -- THAT WE TOOK IN THE PLACENTA TRANSPORTATION ALLOWS US FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND HAS A TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO ALLOW US TO ASSESS THE IMPACT. OF THE PROGRAM ON THE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND THE IMPACT ON THE HOV LANES I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. OF THE ISSUE THIS IS WHY -- AGAIN WE TRY TO BRING -- SOME SORT OF BALANCE AND GET THIS OUR SUNSET IN PLACE SO WE CAN STUDY THE ISSUE AT LEAST AS WE WILL FORWARD TO LOOK FORWARD ARE IN TERMS OF THE EACH OF THE STICKERS ON THE IMPACTS ON EACH WILL BE LANES.

CHAIRMAN FRAZIER ALSO NAY WORTH WITH UBER -- AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT WERE HAPPY TO MOVE TO A NEUTRAL POSITION WITH THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN FULL AND THE COMMITTEES AND ALSO SOMETHING FOR THE GOOD WORK -- JUST IT BRIEFLY PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE -- WE BELIEVE THE RIGHT TRYING ABSOLUTE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN A TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY. SIMPLY GETTING MORE IF HE'S ON THE RIGHT TRAIN PLATFORM NOT JUST GETS. EVEN IS THAT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE LIMITED ASSET ON THE ROADS TODAY BE USED AT A HIGHER FREQUENCY BUT SHARE WITH MORE FOLKS AND GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS OF GETTING THE FIVE MILLIONS AS BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND THE RAMP UP TOWARDS THAT IS I IS GOING HAVE MORE IMPACT INVOLVED MORE PEOPLE AUTHOR USE IN THE SHIRT CASSIDY -- THE BILL NOW HAS A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT BETTER CAPTURES TEENS HE'S CLIMATE IMPACT. THROUGH WHICH TRANSITION IS OUR MISSION IN VEHICLES JUST ONE COMPONENT OF MANY THINGS WE CAN DO TAX REDUCE OUR CLIMATE IMPACTS -- BUT THE BILL DOES NOT CONSIDER IT WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD. IS INCENTIVIZING CLEARING THE OBSTACLES FOR THE DESIRED OUTCOME IN THE BILL WHICH IS MORE MORE CLEAN ELECTRIC MILES AND AND REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS IN THE RIGHT TRYING SECTOR. THESE ALL THESE ARTICLES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT YOU THE TNC JOBS TODAY ARE OFTEN WERE OFF DUE TO RANGE LIMITATIONS DOWNTIME CHARGING THEIR VEHICLES AND JUST GENERAL LACK OF PUBLIC AVAILABLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AMONG OTHER ISSUES -- WITHOUT THE SIGNIFICANT MARKET INFECTIOUS CHANGES WHICH SOME BILLSYOU ARE TO CONSIDER TODAY ADDRESS -- THE MAKING THESE MORE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE DRIVERS OF POTENTIALLY EARN LESS AND EVEY DRIVING FOR UBER AND LEFT. SO COLLECTIVELY ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS IS CHOOSING TO BUY ANY V. -- FOR RIGHT TRAIN PURPOSE WHEN THEY'RE IN THE MARKET TO BUY -- BUT THIS BILL TARGETS ONLY EIGHTEEN SEASON WHILE FAILING TO LEVERAGE ANY POLICIES THAT WOULD CAPITALIZE ON THE ON THE POTENTIAL RIDE SHARING OFFERS. WHO ENCOURAGED THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER THAT THOSE THINGS GOING FOR BUT WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORK ON THE BILL THANK YOU SWEETEST PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DOCUMENT FACTORED REPRESENTING LEFT ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR FOR FOR DILIGENCE IN WORKING WITH US. WITH THE AMENDMENTS -- OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS -- LIVE TO HAS REMOVED ITS OPPOSITION AND WILL GO TO NEUTRAL NOW. GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL NAMELY THE ISSUE OF WORKING WITH THE THAT THE I USE AND OTHERS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A FRAMEWORK. CONTINUE FRAMEWORK FOR MOVING FORWARD ON FAST CHARGING STATIONS. THANK YOU WITH WITH THIS ONE LIKE MORE ABOUT IT WITH TECH GNATS I I LIKE THAT PIECE SPEAKERS WITH THE AUTHOR'S WORK IN THE STOCKS WORK ON THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BEING ACCEPTED WE REMOVE OPPOSITION AGO MITCHELL ON THE BILL. ANY OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO LIKE TO SPEAKING OPPOSITION OF WE SERPENT. SING ON ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE A QUESTION MISTER FUNG. I JUST THAT IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ME SOME SOME -- BACKGROUND OUR OUR DATA I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME FOLKS THERE FROM OVER THE CENTER VALLEY SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN THE CENTER VALLEY. ALLOW FOLKS THAT DRIVE -- FOR UBER AND LIFT AND IT'S IT SAYS THERE THEY COME FROM ALL OF US SPECTRUMS OF THE IF INCOME LEVEL BUT OF COURSE THOSE WHO ARE. STRUGGLING A DR UBER AND LEFT TO TO TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND SO -- THE TNC IS ON THE COMPANIES THEY DON'T ON THE VEHICLES. THE PERSONAL DRIVER THAT'S A PROVIDING SERVICE WITH THEIR OWN VEHICLES SO IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD. TO TO PURCHASE -- A AS EVER BUT THE MOMENT HOW DOES THIS IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE AN INCOME. SO THE WAY THE BILL IS STRUCTURED BOTH IN BOTH WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED AND EVEN AS AMENDED. THE BILL WOULD NOT AFFECT ALL TNC DRIVERS. AND IT IS. DESIGNED TO AFFECT MILES. ON THAT OR AS DEPLOYED ON THE TNC PLATFORM SO HYPOTHETICALLY THAT COULD MEAN THAT ONLY THOSE HIGH HIGH VOLUME DRIVERS. NOW CONCEIVABLY A HIGH VOLUME DRIVER CAN BE LOW INCOME BUT ARE AND CLEAN OUR CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE. PROGRAM HAS 25% OF IT DEDICATED TO LOW INCOME DRIVERS -- A. B. D. GOALS ARE ALSO THERE'S NO 100% GOAL IN THE BILL AND THE HARD TARGETS ARE REMOVED SO THIS ALLOWS FOR THE REGULATORY AGENCIES TO FACTOR THINGS LIKE. THE AVAILABILITY OF VEHICLES THEIR RANGE THEIR COSTS IN THOSE THINGS IN SETTING THE GOALS THAT THEY ADOPT FOR IT SO IT'S DESIGNED TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE. TO FACTOR -- THOSE THINGS AROUND RANGING AROUND INCOME OF DRIVERS AND ALL OF THAT. SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO SO THE MANDATE. THE MANDATE TO TWO AM A THE FLEET MANDATE THAT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IN THAT. THERE IT'S WRITTEN NOW WHERE ON A ARE BE WOULD INITIALLY. BASED ON EMISSIONS FOR DOING A BASELINE EMISSIONS PROFILE OF THE TNC COMPANIES WOULD SET THE GOALS AND THEN P. YOU SEE WOULD ADMINISTER. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AS THEY DO NOW THEY ARE THERE REGULATORY ENTITY FOR PNC'S. AND AND WHAT ARE THE GLOBAL DID DID OTHER GOALS FLETCHER HARM THEIR HEART GOALS ARE OUT OF THE BILL. ANY OTHER USE THROUGH GOOGLE. AYE YES I OF THE FIRST SO I WANT TO THANK THE OFFER THE AUTHOR OF HER -- FOR FOR HER OR LONG STANDING SUPPORTER CLEANER AND THAT'S I THINK WITH THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS -- BUT I HAVE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THIS BILL AND I THINK YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THEM. IN MY MY CONCERN IS THAT IT FURTHER EMPOWERS CARP -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS I SEE FROM THE IS THE FROM IT WILL THE STATE LEGISLATORS I I FEEL LIKE. I I'M ACCOUNTABLE CARB CARDS ON ACCOUNTABLE TO ME. AS A STATE LEGISLATOR OR EVEN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND MY WORRY IS THAT THIS FURTHERS THAT DYNAMIC -- OF A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN WHERE WE WERE HEADING OVER. SOME SIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY AND I JUST DON'T KNOW THERE'S MANY BARRIERS ON AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. I MEAN YOU COULD SAY THAT ABOUT ANY BILL BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE IT'S PRETTY EXPLICIT THEY'RE HANDING THEM A A MISSION. AND AND AND AND AGAIN MY CONCERN IS IS WHERE DOES THIS GO. TO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT AND DO CARE TO WORLD SO THE THE BILL DOES NOT -- AUTHORITY SO IN OTHER WORDS A ARE BE. THE REGULATORY ENTITY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING TMZ'S REMAINS THE P. UC SO ANY. ANY -- ADMINISTRATION ANY ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS OR ADMINISTRATION OF REGULATIONS WOULD STILL SQUARE STAY SQUARELY WITH THE PC. WHAT CARBS RULE WOULD BE IN THIS IS UPON THE RECOMMENDATION IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR TNC COMPANIES? BECAUSE THE OBJECTIVE YES IT IS I'VE CHARACTERIZED IT AS ZEV PSE AND CLEAN MILES IT REALLY IS THAT YOUR QUALITY ISSUE. SO BECAUSE TAILPIPE EMISSIONS STILL ARE THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTING EMISSIONS. AND CALIFORNIA'S STILL HAS A LARGE MAJORITY OF ITS -- GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN NON ATTAINMENT DISTRICTS SO WHAT. A ARBY'S ROLE WOULD BE IS TO WORK WITH THE TNC EAST TO SET A BASELINE OF THEIR EMISSIONS PROFILE AT PRESENT. AND THEN TO WORK OUT AS RECOMMENDED SET OF GOALS FOR HOW DO TO IN EFFECT CLEAN THOSE SMILES BRING DOWN THE EMISSIONS OF THOSE MILES. WHICH THEN THE P. YOU SEE WOULD -- BASICALLY -- ADMINISTER THOUGH THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN THEY DON'T HAVE. TO JUST GUT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF THE TIMING AND IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S DONE BASED ON ALL THESE FACTORS LIKE AVAILABILITY OF VEHICLES. COST VEHICLES RANGE AND THAT SORT OF THING. OKAY THANK YOUNG GUY -- APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE BUT I THINK MY CONCERNS REMAIN THIS BUT I DO YOU FOR YEARS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF CATHOLIC CHURCH SECULAR MUCH CHILD SOLIS WHO THANKED AUTHOR. FULL FOR THIS BILL ON DEUCE IS REALLY NOT NEW -- MOST SOLVE TO TAXI COMPANIES DON'T DO CITIES WERE VERY CHERISHED THE LOCAL AGENCIES TELL US HOW THE REQUIREMENT. OF THEIR FLEET HOW HOW ME CARD HOUSE COULD BE A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO -- I I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TAXI COMPANIES ARE LEFT IN THE CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS IS TO A WAY TO REALLY -- OF PROMOTE A MORE TING WEARS HER AND TO TO DO THE TNC SONG BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE CENTER WAS LIKE CLOTHES. THANKS SO MUCH SO IN -- BECAUSE I CARRIED A BILL LAST YEAR WHICH COMMITTEE SUPPORTED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW THAT GOT AFTER THAT LOOKED AT OUR FLEETS SO BOTH CODIFIED DEBT STATE OWNED FLEETS WOULD HAVE TO BECOME A CERTAIN PERCENT. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OVER CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS. AND WE WOULD ALSO MOVE TOWARDS INCENTIVIZING PRIVATE SECTOR FLEETS -- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW MOST OF US IF WE LEAVE JUST YOU AND I THE REGULAR DRIVER -- TO TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET OUR ZERO MISSION GOALS WE DON'T. CHANGE OUR OWNERSHIP OF VEHICLES FAST ENOUGH WE WE HOLD ON TOWARD VEHICLES WHICH IS A CAN BE A GOOD THING. AND YET IT IS FLEET OWNERS AND HIGH VM TIER HIGH VOLUME DRIVERS THAT CHANGE THEIR VEHICLES MORE FREQUENTLY IN OTHER WORDS PURCHASE NEW ONES [inaudible] AND SO WHAT -- WHAT MY DIFFERENT PIECES OF LEGISLATION ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET AT TRYING TO CREATE THAT KIND OF MARKET SIGNAL SO THAT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE MORE? OFTEN GONNA CHANGE VEHICLE MOVE INTO OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND IN MY OPENING I REFERENCED AND THANK YOU -- CHAIR FOR CLARIFYING THAT THE AMENDMENTS I'VE TAKEN WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS HAVE REMOVED THE OPPOSITION SO TECHNET UBER LIFTER NO LONGER OPPOSED. AND I THINK THIS -- MEETS THAT KIND OF BALANCE OF CREATING ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY AND YET ALLOWS OTHER ENTITIES TO BE PARTNERS WITH THE STATE IN MEETING OUR CLEAN AIR AND OUR CLIMATE PROTECTION CALLS WITHOUT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR -- FROM THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH MY COMMITTEE IN AND WITH THE OPPOSITION ON ON THIS BILL OF IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND THEY THEY'VE. VOIGTS SAID TODAY THAT THEY'VE TAKEN EITHER INTO A NEUTRAL. OF NOT OPPOSING THE THE BILL. I THINK WHAT WERE. HEARING THOUGH HIS. FROM MEMBERS OFTEN ON THE GENERAL -- APPREHENSION [inaudible] ABOUT -- THE THE AIRPORT HAVING ANY KIND OF REGULATORY. AUTHORITY OVER ANY ENTITY. OF BEING ABLE TO DO THIS AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL IT HAD POINTED OUT OF WE WANT THEM TO BECOME A PARTNER. AND AND WORK WITH US THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SOME OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT AN ADMIRABLE GOALS WITHOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD MAYBE LIKE REDUCING CONGESTION. OF THE PORTS. MY BEYOND THE LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE CAN ALL. GET BEHIND TOGETHER YOU KNOW AND ACTUALLY HAVE SOME ACCOMPLISHMENTS -- YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET FIVE MILLION ZONES OUT -- WHICH WITHOUT GIVE STRUCTURES WILL BE ALMOST ON ON ON IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. SO YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BECOME A PARTNER OF WITH THESE AGENCIES TO TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. LAUDABLE GOALS BUT AGAIN -- I APPRECIATE THE ABILITY FOR THE FLEXIBILITY. AND AND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE LOW INCOME. DRIVERS -- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY UTILIZES AS A SOURCE OF INCOME AS A SAFETY NET FOR THEMSELVES. SO WITH THAT IN IN YOUR GOOD WORK COMING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY SO. HOW WE HAVE A FIRST BIKE MISTER KANSEN CHU AND SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN? AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL.

I WANT TO KNOW THAT TECHNICAL INNOVATION ALMOST ALWAYS BENEFITS THE DISABLED DISABILITY COMMUNITY WHICH HAVE BEEN TRUE OF THE TNC EASE WHICH HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO DEAF AND BLIND PERSONS AS WELL AS ELDERLY NEEDING. EXTRA ASSISTANCE THE WHEELCHAIR USERS ESPECIALLY NON FOLDING MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR USERS HAVE NOTED THE CLEAR LACK OF ACCESS TO THE SERVICES TNC IS PROVIDE. MANY LOCALITIES LIKE SEATTLE AND CHICAGO HAVE ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY BY ASSISTING A SURCHARGE ON TNC USED TO HELP PAY FOR ACCESSIBLE TRANSIT OPTIONS. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES TO REGULATE TNC STATEWIDE. THUS THE SOLUTION TO TNC DISABILITY ACCESS UNAVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA WILL REQUIRE STATEWIDE COORDINATION SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX MANDATES THE P. YOU SEE DEVELOP REGULATIONS FOR TNC ACCESSIBILITY. FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING SS IN A FEE ON TNC USED TO FUND ON DEMAND WHEELCHAIR ACCESS SERVICES COLLEGE DISABILITY ACCESS TO TNC SHE SHOULD BE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL MEMBERS. SENATOR I SEE YOU HAVE FO WITNESSES I DO SUPPORT IT FRASER.

WE CAN PARTNER WITH EXISTING PARATRANSIT SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR WE CAN AT ENTERTAINED ON ENGAGE IN COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIPS TO GET THEM ON THE PLATFORM SO. I THINK THAT THE MEMBERS IN THE BILL THAT PROVIDES A FLEXIBLE FEE STRUCTURE WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE FEE APPLIED TO OUR BUSINESS -- DID IT AND IT IS ON THAT HE DOESN'T YOU KNOW -- DISINCENTIVE I'D MAKE IT DIRECT INVESTMENT IMPROVING SUPPLY. AND THEN THE FACT THAT -- IF THE BILL I TAKES A REGIONAL APPROACH THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY MAKING SURE NO LEFT NOWHERE OF CALIFORNIA'S LEFT OUT BY THE BILL. WILL REQUIRE OBVIOUSLY A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SERVICE PROVIDED IN THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE NEAR THE NEAR THE SENATORS DISTRICT. SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED IN THE SAME -- FEE STRUCTURE AS AS SOMETHING IN A LIST OF THE THERE'S SORT OF A COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN EVERY PART OF THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS. I'D JOHN ROSS ON BEHALF OF LEFT HAD THIS IS ONE WHERE WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE CLEAR ALIGNMENT WITH -- SENATOR HILL AND THAT PROPONENTS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

START WHEN YOU'RE A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. A CURRENT LAW REQUIRES ANY CALIFORNIA WHO WANTS TO DRIVE A LARGE TRUCK PASSENGER BUS OR OTHER COMMERCIAL VEHICLE. TO OBTAIN A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE BY SIMPLY PASSING A WRITTEN TEST IN A SHORT DRIVING TESTS ADMINISTERED BY THE DMV. THERE'S NO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLICANTS FOR A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE RECEIVE ANY INSTRUCTIONAL TRAINING OR EVEN COMPLETE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS OF TRAINING BEHIND THE WHEEL. BEFORE BEING LICENSED BY THE STATE. CALIFORNIA REQUIRES FIFTY HOURS OF BEHIND THE WHEEL TRAINING WHEN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SEEKS THEIR FIRST DRIVER'S LICENSE. YET WE REQUIRE NO MINIMUM HOURS HAVE BEHIND THE WHEEL TRAINING PRIOR TO LICENSING SOMEONE TO DRIVE AND EIGHTY THOUSAND POUND SEMI TRUCK ON PUBLIC STREETS AND ROADS. MEMBERS THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE IN WITH UPWARDS OF FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE KILLED IN LARGE TRUCK CRASHES EACH YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS PARAMOUNT THAT WE ESTABLISH MINIMUM STANDARDS. TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMERCIAL DRIVERS ARE SAFELY OPERATING THERE VEHICLES ON THE ROADS THEY SHARE WITH OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY SIX WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW FEDERAL RULE ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT ESTABLISHES NEW SAFETY AND TRAINING STANDARDS FOR ALL ENTRY LEVEL COMMERCIAL DRIVER APPLICANTS. SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY SIX WILL ADDITIONAL ESTABLISH A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF FIFTEEN HOURS A BEHIND THE WHEEL TRAINING AS PART OF THOSE NEW TRAINING STANDARDS. IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL DRIVER TRAINING. S. FIRST BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I MET THE FAMILY. TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD DANIEL MCGUIRE SANTA CRUZ WHO WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A TRUCK ACCIDENT. ON HIGHWAY SEVENTEEN IT WAS CAUSED BY A COMMERCIAL DRIVER WHO WAS LICENSED BY THE STATE. BUT WHO LACKS THE MOST BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO PROPERLY OPERATE HIS FORTY TON TRUCK THAT ULTIMATELY KILLED DANIEL IN INJURED SEVEN OTHERS. DANIEL'S FAMILY HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TWICE BEFORE TO SHARE THEIR STORY IN THEIR HERE IN THE AUDIENCE AGAIN TODAY. TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REAL CONSEQUENCES OF LICENSING DRIVERS WITHOUT REQUIRING ADEQUATE. BEHIND THE WHEEL TRAINING THROUGH THE BILL. MEMBERS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ACT NOW TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL DRIVERS ARE RECEIVING COMPREHENSIVE. AND EFFECTIVE TRAINING. SUPPORTING SP TWELVE THIRTY SIX TODAY YOU'LL BE HELPING US TO TAKE THAT FIRST CRITICAL STEP. SPEC FLASHED YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND MISTER CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.
