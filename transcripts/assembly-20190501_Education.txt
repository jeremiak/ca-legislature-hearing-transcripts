CALLING ON THIS HEARING TO ORDER WILL -- STARS A SUB COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET. HAVE A QUORUM MR KILEY IS PRESENTING A BILL IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. AND HE WILL BE JOINING US A MOMENTARILY -- SO ALL OF ON CALLING THE ROLL -- WE HAVE THREE BILLS ON THE AGENDA TODAY INCLUDING ONE ON CONSENT. THE MEASURES ON CONSERVE THE MEASURE CONSENT IS AB. FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE WE TAKE UP AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX BY MISTER KALRA EACH SIDE WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF SIX MINUTES. FOR EITHER TWO OR THREE WITNESSES BY PRIOR ARRANGEMENT WITH ME. THIS COMMITTEE ALL OTHER SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION MAY LINE UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND STATE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY -- SO AGAIN EARLY STE IT'LL BE -- SIX MINUTES ON EACH SIDE TOTAL -- WITH. THE THE DESIGNATED NUMBER OF WITNESSES -- WE HAVE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC ATTENDING TODAY WHO IS SENSITIVE TO LOUD NOISES AND WE WOULD REMIND ALL PARTICIPANTS TO SPEAK AT A CONVERSATIONAL TONE. AND NOT YELL OR CLUB OR MAKE OTHER LOUD NOISES WITH THAT WE ARE READY TO BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST AUTHOR AND THAT'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MON -- SHE MAY COME FOR TO THAT'S FILE ITEM NUMBER COMING UP TO PRESENT -- AB TEN SIXTY TWO MUSLIM ON YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. I ALWAYS START OFF BY ASKING FOR THE MAYBE. AB FIFTY TWO WILL HELP HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO BETTER PREPARE FOR AN EXIT AND EXPECTED DISASTER A YEAR AGO MY DISTRICT EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY WHICH WAS. PRECEDED BY A MASSIVE DEBRIS FLOW. FOR US FLOW DUE TO HEAVY RAINSTORMS THIS STRATEGY RESULTED IN MULTIPLE LIVES LOS IT ALSO LEFT MANY PEOPLE AND FIRST RESPONDERS STRANDED DUE TO ROAD CLOSURE CLOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH DEBRIS FLOW AND FLOODING. THE TEEN SIR CONCEPT WAS CREATED TO ADDRESS PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE CAPABILITIES FROM WITHIN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AB TEN SIXTY TWO WILL PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TEAM COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM CERT BASIC TRAINING AND RECEIVE CREDITS FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION. TEEN SIR TRAINING WILL TRAIN STUDENTS AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND BASIC RESPONSE AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SKILLS NEEDED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND ASSIST WITH OTHERS. OTHERS IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY -- I A WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AYE CHRISTY FAMILY HERE WITH AT A CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS BUT SHE'S TRYING TO GET INTO THE BUILDING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. I RESPECTFULLY HAS REVIVED. THANK YOU US ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. A SINGLE OTHERS ANY OPPOSITION. OKAY I DO WE HAVE A MOTION. REMOVES ALL SECOND IT AND WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE ON A QUORUM BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE ON THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE A FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO I BELIEVE IT IS. AND THAT'S YEAH AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX MISTER KALRA. HE IS SOMEWHERE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. TO ESTABLISH WARM. CAN I SHOW YOU ARE. GOOD. O'DONNELL. HERE O'DONNELL HERE KILEY KALRA. KALRA HERE MCCARTY SMITH SMITH HERE WEBER. WEBER HERE. WE DO HAVE WE DO OF COURSE IS ALL. CALL THE COMMITTEE HEARING. AT SOMEBODY OCCASION COMMITTEE HEARING TO ORDER -- MISTER KALRA HAS -- FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS AB. FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU ALL FOR WAITING PATIENTLY FOR MISTER KALRA. WHO HAS NOT SHOWN UP? WE WON'T DISSECT THE REASONS YOU REALIZE. BUT WE DO HAVE A BE. WITH YOU BEING LATE. IT WAS REALLY BAD. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH ME ABOUT THE BILL TAKEN TIME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DIE SECTIONAL CHART IS. THERE A WIDELY AVAILABLE AS I ALSO WANT TO THANK A NUMBER OF YOUR STAFF MEMBERS WHO TOOK A LOT OF TIME OUT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT AS WELL -- AND AYE AYE LASTLY LASSEN ABSOLUTE BIKE BUT THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- A LOT OF WORK WAS PUT INTO THIS IN IN THE RESEARCH AS WELL -- ELASSONA THINK THE NUMEROUS TEACHERS RESEARCHERS ADVOCATES WHO HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO ENGAGE WITH ME ON THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT AN EASY TOPIC AND I'M SYMPATHETIC TO CONCERNS RAISED AS TO THEIR APPROACH THIS MEASURE TAKES. AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX WITH ESTABLISHED REPLACING ANIMALS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION REYES ACT. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS REPLACE ANIMAL SECTION WITH THE CONTEMPORARY ALTERNATIVE FOR A MORE HUMANE TEACHING METHOD. THE BILL HAS RECEIVED A AYE AYE UNDERSTANDABLY -- QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION AS OF LATE SO I LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT IT DOES NOT BAN DISSECTION AS A METHOD OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION -- ON CONTRARY WILL HELP TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MORE COST EFFECTIVE HUMANE ENVIRONMENT RESPONSIBLE METHODS OF DISSECTION OTHER THAN ANIMAL DISSECTION. I AM NOT I SECTION HAS BEEN. A PART OF TEACHING PEDAGOGY FOR SOME TIME AND IT MAY VERY WELL PEAK THE INTEREST FOR SOME STUDENTS PURSUE A CAREER IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. HOWEVER OVER TIME HAS BEEN USE LESS AND LESS IN THE CLASSROOM INCREASED DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AS A HOW TO STUDENTS AS HOUSING. AS TO HOW STUDENTS RECONCILED HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS WITH THE PRACTICE OF SCIENCE. AND RENEWAL BY MAIL PERSPECTIVE ON THE COUNTER FOR TO TALLY THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS USE AND ANNUALLY NUMBER. IN THE MANY THOUSANDS AND PROVIDES A CLEAR PICTURE OF BOTH THE FISCAL IMPACT TO SCHOOLS AND MPACT THE SOURCING THESE ANIMALS CAN HAVE. ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AS WE KNOW A STUDENTS ARE A PRODUCT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT. AND ARE FAR MORE ABLE TO NAVIGATE LEARN THROUGH TECHNOLOGY -- THAT OUR GENERATION AND GENERATIONS BEFORE US. EDUCATIONAL ALTERNATIVES PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS ON A MORE ENGAGING OF ALL STUDENTS THAN CURRENT DISSECTION METHODOLOGIES. IN FACT WE NUMEROUS WE SHIP RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. AS DEMONSTRATED ALTERNATIVES RESULT IN EITHER COMPARED OF EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS. AND THERE ARE AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE STUDIES -- THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT COMPARABLE OR BETTER OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS AND THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL BEHIND EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY IN THOSE SCHOOLS ALTERNATE HAVE BEEN USED THEIR PROVEN TO BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND HELP INCREASE STUDENTS INTEREST AND PARTICIPATION BY INTEREST IN REDUCING CONTEMPORARY METHODS OF THE CLASSROOMS. THEY GIVE ALL STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND BE MORE ENGAGING THE HANDS ON ACTIVITY I CAN INSPIRED EVEN MORE STUDENTS TO DIVE DEEPER. INTO SCIENCE. BY ADOPTING A CONTEMPORARY HUMANE METHOD STUDENTS CAN HAVE A BETTER EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE CAN BE A COST SAVINGS. FOR SCHOOLS AND THE LAST CENTURY DETRIMENTAL -- TO TO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND TO THE ANIMALS. WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY OUR DOCTOR DON FORRESTER WITH THE FIT THE PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE. MATTHEW DUNCAN -- WITH WITH THE ABC UNIFIED AND NICK PSYCHOSOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION [inaudible] FORCED. ALL RIGHT BERMAN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE THREE WITNESSES TO FIND IT SIX MINUTES TOTAL. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I APPRECIATE IT BEING ABLE TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS DON FORRESTER. AND I'VE PRACTICED IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. I COMPLETED MY FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY IN SACRAMENTO. AND I'M A GRADUATE OF THAT AMOUNT HEALTH CARE'S ADVANCED TRAINING PROGRAM IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. MY EXPERIENCE AS A CLINICIAN AND THEN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT LEADS ME TO STRONGLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL. FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX BECAUSE OF OUR FUTURE DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS DESERVE SCIENTIFIC LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASSIONATE. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE NEARLY EVERY MEDICAL STUDENT IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING ME WORK WITH LIVE DOGS AS PART OF OUR TRAINING. OVER TIME THESE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH MORE EFFECTIVE REALISTIC MODELS. THESE ADVANCED TOOLS INCLUDE MANIKINS SIMULATORS AND PASS TRAINERS INVOLVING HAPTIC FEEDBACK. THE FEELING OF REAL TISSUE WHICH CAN BE USED REPEATEDLY TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE AND MASTERY OF SKILLS. ANY FOR PHYSICIANS HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES TWENTY FOR BIOLOGY STUDENTS. SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT LOOKING BACK I WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED MORE FROM THE NEWER TECHNIQUES AND THAT AYE SECTIONS IN MY BIOLOGY CLASSES IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL. R. K. TO TWELVE STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT USING SOME MORE EXPERIENCES AS WE NOW USE THE MEDICAL TRAINING INDEED I BELIEVE THEY MUST. POSITION TODAY REGULARLY USE SIMULATORS COMPUTER PROGRAM VIDEO ASSISTED TOOLS IN THEIR DAILY PRACTICE SCIENTISTS USE TECHNOLOGY TO GATHER DATA AND OBSERVE THE WORLD AROUND THEM. WHILE NOT ALL STUDENTS WILL BE DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS EVERY K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENT OUR STATE CAN BENEFIT FROM IMPROVED BIOLOGY. TRAINING IN BIOLOGY AND WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB FIFTEEN IT IS TO FIX. THEY WILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS MATTHEW DUNCAN AND I AM A BIOLOGIST A. B. R. A BIOLOGY TEACHER. AND TAUGHT FOR THIRTY YEARS IN THE ABC UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE AND BACKGROUND IN SCIENCE EDUCATION I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU MY STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX THE REYES ACT. BECAUSE TODAY'S STUDENTS DESERVE A SOLID. MODERN SCIENTIFIC LEARNING EXPERIENCE. THAT IS COMPASSIONATE AND ENGAGING. WHEN I TAUGHT A P. BIOLOGY WE USED DISSECTION AS PART OF OUR LESSON PLAN? AND DISSECTED RATS. DURING THIS CLASS IT WAS DIFFICULT. OR IT WAS CLEAR THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND HAD DIFFICULTY CONDUCTING THE DISSECTION. THEY FOUND THE FORMALDEHYDE. DIFFICULT TO STOMACH. AND HAD STRONG VISCERAL REACTIONS TO THE CUTTING AND DISMEMBERING OF THE RATS. WHICH AFFECTED THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND EFFECTIVELY COMPREHEND THE COURSE WORK. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PRECAUTIONARY STEPS THAT I TOOK TO LIMIT THE EXPOSURE TO FORMALDEHYDE. ANY EXPOSURE TO THESE AIRBORNE TOXINS CAN BE HARMFUL. INSTEAD OF USING ACTUAL ANIMAL SPECIMENS. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED USING ALTERNATIVE HUMANE TEACH SCIENCE TEACHING TOOLS SUCH AS DIGITAL. AND VIRTUAL DISSECTION. WHICH I BELIEVE ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE OLD ANIMAL DISSECTION PROTOCOL. THERE ARE NO TOXIC CHEMICALS. NO MESS NO CHANCE OF INJURY. NO ODOR. AND INVOLVES NO TIME FOR CLEAN UP. STUDENTS WOULD HAVE. HAD THE CHANCE TO WORK ON THE LESSON AT HOME AND REPEAT INSTRUCTIONS IF THEY MADE A MISTAKE. WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THEM. STUDENTS MAY HAVE A MORBID CURIOSITY ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE AN ANIMAL. BUT I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE STUDENTS BENEFIT WHEN UP ALL HAVE ACCESS TO THE CURRICULUM. AS A TEACHER IT WAS MY OBLIGATION TO TEACH RESPECT FOR OTHERS. WHICH INCLUDES THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. TEACHING COMPASSIONATE SCHOOLS LEADS TO KINDER ADULTS WHO TREAT ALL WITH KINDNESS AND RESPECT. THERE IS NO REASON TO DISSECT ANIMALS WHEN WE CAN TEACH THE NEXT GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OTHER WORDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. HELLO MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SACKETT SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WE WE LIKE. TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL FOR OFFERING THIS LEGISLATION AND THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS MODERN SCIENCE CURRICULA AND STANDARDS DO NOT REQUIRE -- OR REFERENCE THE USE OF ANIMAL THEY SECTION IN FACT THE COLLEGE BOARD'S AP BIOLOGY THE INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE. AND NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS MAKE NO MENTION OF AN ANIMAL THEY SECTION. THE POPULAR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS SECTION IS SCHOOLS IS THAT IT IS THE DAY SECTION OF FROGS AND WARMS. HOWEVER A RECENT SURVEY OF SCHOOLS THAT REQUIRED A SECTION AS PART OF THEIR SCIENCE CURRICULA INCLUDE FETAL PIGS. CATS SHARKS SHEEP AND OTHER ANIMALS. ADVANCES IN MEDICAL SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY AT THE EDUCATORS NEED FOR BETTER TEACHING AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND GROWING CONCERN ABOUT ANIMAL USE IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS HAVE ALL CONTRIBUTED TO A PARADIGM SHIFT IN BIO MEDICAL EDUCATION. TODAY SIMULATION BASED LEARNING IS MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE NON ANIMAL TEACHING METHODS INCLUDES INCLUDE INTERACTIVE COMPUTER PROGRAMS HIGH QUALITY VIDEOS AND LIFE LIKE MODELS. THEY HAVE INHERENT EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION SAYS IS EASE OF USE CUSTOMIZE CUSTOMIZATION AND REPEAT REPUTATION FOR LEARNING PURPOSES. NON ANIMAL TEACHING METHOD SAVE TIME CUT COSTS AND IMPROVE CITY. STUDENT SAFETY ADDITIONALLY THIS WOULD HELP TO REMOVE STUDENT AND TEACHER EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS EXPENSIVE. CARCINOGENIC AND EVEN FATAL CHEMICALS SUCH AS FORMALDEHYDE. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT FROM ALL THE HEIGHT IS CLASSIFIED AS A GROUP ONE CARCINOGEN IS LISTED ON PROP. SIXTY FIVE AS A CHEMICAL THAT CAUSES CANCER AND CANNOT BE ENTIRELY ELIMINATED THROUGH WASHING. IT IS IN FACT AN ANIMAL IN FACT ANIMALS ARE COLLECTED SOURCE FROM -- THESE ARE DALY SUMMARIZE YES -- JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS WILL ALSO HAVE A GOOD EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT BY REDUCING THE ANIMALS PULLED FROM THE WILD AND WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE GUY. THANK YOU. NOW HERE FROM OPPOSITION. I'M SORRY OTHER I'M SORRY I'M AND MYSELF. THE OTHERS IN SUPPORT YOU GOT UP TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY.

WHAT'S PRESS THE BUTTON OKAY GOOD MORE A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS PETER VAN METER I'M AN EIGHTEEN YEAR HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY ANATOMY PHYSIOLOGY. AND MARINE BIOLOGY TEACHER FROM AM OKAY HIGH SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE UST. IN A CHAIR OF THE CTA'S CURRICULUM INSTRUCTIONS COMMITTEE. ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I'M URGING THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX BANNING DIE SECTIONS AND CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. CTA BELIEVES THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OP -- STATE OPT OUT OF LAW FOR STUDENTS WITH NORMAL OBJECT A MORAL OBJECTIONS TO PARTICIPATING SIGN SLAPS CTA MET WITH THE AUTHOR AND DISCUSS POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS WITHOUT AGREEMENT. CITY STRONGLY OPPOSES THE BILL BECAUSE OF IT ELIMINATES EDUCATIONS PROFESSIONALS EXPERTISE TO STAY SECTION AS A MEANINGFUL LEARNING EXPERIENCE PROMOTING HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE UNSURPASSED. BY ANY OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL TOOL TO STUDENTS INTERESTED IN AND BEEN BENEFITING FROM THIS HANDS ON LEARNING METHOD. IT IMPOSES NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON TEACHERS AND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS WILL FEEL NEGLIGENT IN THEIR DUTY TO MEET THE LEARNING NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND STUDENTS WILL FEEL DEPRIVED OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE. MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE PRACTICES OF SCIENCE LEARNING THROUGH DISSECTION. TAKE A LET ME STUDENTS TAKING HONORS ADVANCED PLACEMENT CLASSES AND COLLEGE ARTICULATED COURSES REQUIRING DISSECTION. THEY SECTIONS VALUE IN CALIFORNIA NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS IS ILLUSTRATED IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO SCIENCE EDUCATION GRAPHIC AND NARRATIVE OF CORE IDEAS PRACTICES AND CROSS CUTTING CONCEPTS ON PAGE. FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THE BILLS PROHIBITS XIN ON TEACHERS USING STANDARDS ALIGNED INSTRUCTIONAL TOOLS ON NICE SECTION TO BENEFIT STUDENT LEARNING UNDERMINES MEETING THAT CALIFORNIA DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS ON COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. CDA ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO TRUST TEACHERS PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND TRUST STUDENTS TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES TO OPT OUT OF SCIENCE LABS. CTA APPRECIATES THE AUTHORS POLICY BRIEFING ON ALTERNATIVES TO DIE SECTION AND IS OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO IMPROVE STATE OPT OUT LAW FOR STUDENTS. BUT WE RESPECTFULLY URGE I KNOW VOTE TO BAN ANIMAL DISSECTION IN CALIFORNIA SCIENCE INSTRUCTION FOR THE REASONS STATED I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS A LESSON IMAGE COUPLE FAIRFIELD AND I AM. HERE ON BEHALF OF C. S. T. A AND AN ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM SCIENCE TEACHER. I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO PLEAD WITH YOU TO PLEASE NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE DESIGNED FOR MY STUDENTS. AND NOT TO TAKE AWAY. FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES THAT INCLUDE ANIMAL DISSECTION THEY SECTION AS A TOOL TO HELP ENGAGE STUDENTS. THE CALIFORNIA NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS HAVE SHIFTED INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES TO SUPPORTING SCIENTIFIC IT SCIENTIFICALLY LITERATE SOCIETY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS THAT WILL IMPACT FUTURE GENERATIONS. A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE SHIFT IS THAT STUDENTS ARE DRIVING THE INSTRUCTION. IN USING THE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES AND CROSS CUTTING CONCEPTS MY STUDENTS ARE THE ONES ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN PHENOMENA BY ASKING THE QUESTIONS ARE YOU GOING FROM EVIDENCE AND ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. IN A HANDS ON MATTER THAT IS DESIGNED BY STUDENTS NATURAL CURIOSITY AND WONDER. THE DIGITAL TOOLS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF INSTRUCTION AND REMOVE THE COLLABORATIVE ASPECT OF THE SCIENCE CLASSROOM. STUDENTS CURIOSITY IN WONDER ARE NOT DRIVING INSTRUCTION INSTEAD STUDENTS ARE SHOWN ONE PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT A SINGULAR SPECIMEN. THE PRACTICE IS THE ANTITHESIS OF THE NATURE OF SCIENCE THE FOUNDATION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS. IN THAT SCIENTISTS OBSERVE MULTIPLE SPECIMENS FOR VARIATION OF TRAITS. AS A TEACHER IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR MY CLASSROOM. IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS I CONSIDER THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL I CARE ABOUT MY STUDENTS AND WANT WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM. STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF ALL CLASS INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING SPECIMENS TO THE LEVEL OF THEIR COMFORT. I MAKE THIS WELL KNOWN IN MY CLASSROOM AND AT MY SITE. IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR ALL GRADES OR EVEN CLASSROOMS WITH ANY GRADE LEVEL AND IS TEACHER CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO PERFORM A DISSECTION ACTIVITY. AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER I PROVIDE EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION ON THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ALL SPECIMENS IN THE CLASSROOM AND IN THE HOME. THIS HAS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND COMPASSION FOR ANIMALS THAT STUDENTS WOULD NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDER WORTHY. MY COLLEAGUES AND I NEED THE APPROPRIATE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST FOR STUDENTS SUCH AS THE HIGH ENGLISH LEARNER ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER POPULATION WHO DO NOT BENEFIT FROM WORKSHEETS SUCH AS THOSE OFFERED BY THE DIGITAL PROGRAMS. BUT NEED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD AND MAKE SENSE OF THEIR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS I AM ASKING YOU TO LEAVE THIS DECISION IN THE HANDS OF TEACHERS THAT CARE ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF THEIR STUDENTS NOT ONLY WHILE THEY'RE IN OUR pBUT ALSO THE ADULTS THEY WILL BECOME THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY MAKE PRIDE IN BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS UNFORTUNATELY ACCESS IS ALSO OPPOSED TO A. B. FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX WE THINK IT JUST GOES TOO FAR BY PROHIBITING STUDENTS FROM PERFORMING DIE SECTIONS. IN A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOL THEY SECTION IS ALREADY AN OPTIONAL CLASSROOM ACTIVITY IN SOME SCHOOLS I SECTION IS A VALUABLE TEACHING TOOL AND IT OTHER STUDENTS MAY HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. BUT THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY LOCALLY TO DECIDE AGAIN THIS IS OPTIONAL AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE. AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX IS COUNTER TO LOCAL CONTROL AND WOULD REMOVE HANDS ON LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND EDUCATIONAL CHOICES FROM CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THIS BAND IS TOO AGGRESSIVE AND SUGGEST THAT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL LEADERS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ARE DOING SOMETHING EXPLICITLY WRONG THAT WARRANT STATE INTERVENTION WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE CASE. WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENGAGE STUDENTS AND FOSTER COLLABORATIVE TACTILE CLASSROOM EXPERIENCES WE SHOULD BE ADDING TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO THE TOOLBOX NOT TAKING THEM AWAY. IN ADDITION TO THAT SECTION BEING ALREADY BEING OPTIONAL STUDENTS THEMSELVES HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF PARTICIPATING IN CLASSROOM BY SECTIONS. THE OPT OUT SECTION A IF THE OPT OUT SESSION OF THE EDUCATION CODE IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT OR NEEDS CLARIFICATION. AN AXE IS HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THAT POLICY DISCUSSION. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGE TWELVE SUGGESTS AN INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE TO AN OUTRIGHT BAN AND THAT ARE INTERESTING PROPOSALS. WHICH AGAIN WE ARE HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR PLEASE RISE. WE MUST OPPOSE IN OUR BAND AYE DISSECTION. WHICH IS THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY RESPECTFULLY ASK MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO COME. SAID OF THE PROBLEM THIS BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHETHER THIS BAND IS ACTUALLY THE APPROPRIATE STATEWIDE POLICY SOLUTION THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RON RAP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. AS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ALL OF ROCK RIGHT CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MR TURN MEMBERS TAYLOR RUSH WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AND THE ONLY HALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA EGG FARMERS. GRAIN AND FEED ASSOCIATION PORK PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION WALKER CESSATION OF PACIFIC IN EXAMPLE TRAIN OPPOSITION. MATT PATTON CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND EIGHTEEN YEAR AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGY TEACHER IN STRONG OPPOSITION. ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION SING OPPOSITE FOR THEIR OPPOSITION WE'RE BEHIND. THE REAL TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS MANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] MCCARTY. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE FIRST. SEVERAL QUESTIONS THE FIRST OFF THAT I HAD A GATE MISTER KALRA. YOU MENTIONED THAT -- WITH THIS BILL THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROHIBITION ON DIE SECTIONS YOU'RE YOU'RE ALLUDING THAT. THE STUDENTS WOULDN'T BE DISSECTING BUT THAT THE TEACHERS WOULD STILL BE. THAT THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT AS ACT. CAN YOU HELP US KNOW THROUGH THE CHAIR -- NOTE THAT THAT IT WOULD BE AN ANIMAL DISSECTION -- DISSECTION BY ITSELF DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT HAVE TO BE AN ANIMAL AFTER DISSECTING. THE WHAT THAT SECTION WITH THE COULD BE A MODEL COULD BE THE COULD BE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY COULD BE THREE TIMES A THREE DIMENSIONAL IT COULD BE. ANY NUMBER IT AT THE DEMONSTRATION THURSDAY THERE ALSO OTHER PHYSICAL -- TYPES OF OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELING OF YEAH FROGS AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DIE SO YEAH. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS THAT THE PUSH FOR THIS IS TWO FOLD IT AND I UNDERSTAND -- STAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AND I AM. I'M NOT I'M NOT CONVINCED ON THIS AND SO I HAVE SOME SOME QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ALLOW YOU TO PROTECT POTENTIALLY PERSUADE ME. SO. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS TWO FOLD IS THAT ONE DAY EXISTING LAW WHICH I GUESS WAS THAT. JACKIE SPEARED MEASURE FROM TWO DECADES AGO WHICH ALLOW STUDENTS TO OPT OUT. IS -- IS INSUFFICIENT AND DOESN'T HAVE -- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STUDENTS TO HAVE. A MEANINGFUL SCIENCE PARTICIPATION SO THAT'S ONE PART OF IT AND THE OTHER PART OF YOUR ARGUMENT I I THINK THE LARGER ARGUMENT YOU THINK THIS IS -- IMMORAL AND AND NOT NECESSARY IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY WELL YEAH CERTAINLY MORALITY BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF HOW INSTRUCTIONS BEING DONE I MEAN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE BACHELOR'S A MEDICAL TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE NOT DISSECTING ANIMALS ARE USING TECHNOLOGY. I MEAN IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TRAIN DOES THAT MAKE CHOOSE A CAREER OF THE SCIENCES YOU TRAINED ON WITH WHAT. AND EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE A CHANCE. TO YOU KNOW THAT I SECOND HOURS BUT OF THE POINT IS THAT. WE WANT TO FIRST OF ALL BEING CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD OFFER WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE BEST AND NOT JUST ME THAT LOOK LIKE AS I MENTIONED IS THIRTY FIVE PLUS STUDIES. THAT SHOW IT'S COMPARABLE OR BETTER TO USE ALTERNATE METHODS THAT ANIMAL DISSECTION AND I JUST I SECTION IS ONE ACT SURE -- BUT ISN'T IT CHOICE IN THAT SO IT'S NOT MEDICAL SCHOOL THE STUDENTS ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT INSPIRING THEM TO MAYBE GOING TO STEM EDUCATION SO. YOU KNOW MAYBE THE PHYSICAL ACT -- THINGY ANIMAL INSPIRE SOMEONE IN SCIENCE AND AND WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING THAT OPTION FOR SOON TO DO THAT OR CONVERSELY OPT OUT LIKE THE OTHER STUDENTS SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY IN FACT JUST BY CHANCE. ABOUT AN HOUR AGO -- IS STAFFERS MENTION BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION CAME UP THIS WAS CONCERNING MEDICAL SCHOOL SOCIAL AND TOUCH IT I SECTION. THIS CONSIDER THOSE THAT ARE BEING PUSHED AWAY AT A YOUNG AGE AND THEY'RE NOT PREPARED FOR THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY TO NEVER GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL I THINK THAT'S A FAR MORE. COMMON OCCURRENCE OF SOMEONE THAT SPARKED BUT EVENTUALLY GOES INTO THE SCIENCES THE THE TECHNOLOGY THE OTHER ALL TERMS AVAILABLE ALSO SPARK. GREAT INTEREST IN GREAT DESIRE AND I HAD THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY IS YOUR DAUGHTER REALLY ENJOYING SOME OF THEM ON THURSDAY AT THE BRIEFING AND WAS REALLY COOL TO SEE. BECAUSE OF THIS IS THE KIND OF LEARNING THAT MORE MORE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE A CUSTOM -- TO MANY EVEN LIFE SCIENCES COMPANIES AND OTHER COMPANIES -- THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH ARE NOT USING ANIMALS -- THEY'RE MOVING MORE MORE AWAY FROM. AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT IF WE REALLY WANT TO SPARK INTEREST DESPITE THE INTERESTS I DON'T THINK YOU SUBJECT A 100% OF STUDENTS. TO THIS ACT OF CUTTING INDIANA AND ANIMALS TO SPARK INTEREST THIRD. STRAIGHT SHOOTER BECAUSE WOULDN'T BE 100% IF IT'S AN OPTION AND IN YOU YOU ALLUDED -- TO YES THE LAST NEARLY TWO WEEKS -- ONE OF MY TWIN DAUGHTERS HAD THE CHANCE TO STUMBLE ACROSS YOUR EXHIBITOR DAY AND MESS AROUND THE IPAD -- TO GREAT SKILL MY UNDERSTANDING AND THE OTHER -- DAUGHTER A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS ABLE TO HELP BE PART OF A DISSECTION OF A PIG AND TAKES HEART IN THEIR CLASSROOM. AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT WAS INTRIGUING AND INTERESTING IN A LONG TIME THAT TOO SO I DO SEE THE VALUE OF A BOTH OF THESE -- UP THE PIECES AND SO -- WE KNOW YOUR BILL DO YOU WOULDN'T HOW ALLOW ANY OF THAT -- TO TO BE ABLE TO TO OCCUR. AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY AND COST I'M SURE THERE'S A PREFERRED VENDOR WHOSE YOU KNOW CHOMPING AT THE BIT RATE AND MAKE MONEY SELLING THIS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A FACTOR AS WELL AND SO WOULD WOULD WE BE ABLE. TO TO YOU KNOW. TO THIS RIGHT AWAY I I'D KNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERTS FROM THAT SCHOOL COMMUNITY BEHIND YOU BOTH THE TEACHERS AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COURSE TO YOUR RIGHT. WELL I WOULD I WAS FIRST OF ALL BE WILLING TO HAVE A TIME PERIOD. FOR THIS TO GOING TO A FACT WOULDN'T BE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR SO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GET PREPARED FOR IT SECONDLY YOU'RE PRESUMING RIGHT NOW THAT AREN'T VENDORS RIGHT NOW MAKING A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY. OFF SELLING THESE ANIMALS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THE COST -- THE START UP COSTS -- WHICH ARE OFTENTIMES AT THE SAME WAY CHEAPER THAN BUYING ANIMALS FOR ONE YEAR. AND SO. BE IT I DON'T MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT ONE VENDOR IS GONNA MAKE MONEY WONDERS ARE THERE ARE DOZENS OF VENDORS THAT PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES DISSECTION -- AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT QUESTION YET THAT THING SOME ONLY ASK THE QUESTION WHO'S MAKING THE MONEY NOW TO SOMEONE MAKING A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY NOW THAT'S PROVIDING THEM. ARE THERE JEFF RESEARCHER SAYS ONCE MORE EXPENSIVE THE OTHER JUST MAYBE IT'S A WASH -- I THINK THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY USE I THINK THAT IT'S A WASHER CHEAPER I THINK THAT THE ALTERNATIVE TEND TO BE CHEAPER BUT THEN IT WILL BE UP TO THE SCHOOL AS WELL AND AGAIN. THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOFTWARE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MODELS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT CAN BE RE USED WAS A ONE TIME COST YOU HAVE TO REPURCHASE ANIMALS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THAT'S AN ONGOING YEAR OVER YEAR OVER YEAR COST. OKAY AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISS THIS AND THEN ALSO SOMEWHERE IS THERE IS THIS BUT THIS WOULD BE IT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST. STATE TO DO THIS THAT'S CORRECT. ALRIGHT THAT'S IT IF I IF I COULD TO THE CHAIR THE THE THE COMMENT REGARDING WALL IT GIVES IT. THANK EXPERIENCE THAT IS TO MY HOUSE YES STUDENTS MIGHT HAVE A VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES WITH ANIMAL DISSECTION SOME AND MAYBE MORE POSITIVE SOME MORE NEGATIVE. PRESS MY CONTENTION THAT THE ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE WILL GIVE EXPERIENCE AND THE EVEN OF ONE OFFS OUT OFTENTIMES OPT OUT THERE ARE STILL SIT IN THE CLASSROOM. THEY'RE NOT GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY OF ANYTHING NEARLY NEAR THE EQUIVALENT OF THAT TYPE OF INSTRUCTION. AND IF IT'S TRULY EACH IF IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THE ANIMAL DEATHS AYE SECTIONS OF UNSURPASSED BY ANY OF THE ANY OF THE LEARNING TOOL THE ARGUMENT SHOULD BE THAT. IT SHOULD BE MANDATED FOR EVERY TEACHER DO IT BUT IT'S NOT IN FACT IT'S NOT EVEN PART OF THE SITE IN A REQUIREMENT EDUCATION CODE OR FOR INTERNATIONAL BACHELOR PROGRAMS. NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS COLLEGE BOARD IT IS TRULY UNSURPASSED THAT WOULD BE THE CASE BUT IT'S NOT THEIR ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE JUST AS AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER. AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO THE TWO OPPORTUNITIES AND SOMEONE CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT OKAY WELL EITHER ONE WILL WORK AND LET. SOMEONE DECIDE I'M GONNA CHOOSE FOR THE ONE THAT FIRST OF ALL PUSHED PREPARES OUR STUDENTS FOR THE MODERN WORLD AND HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRAIN IN THE SCIENCES I'M ALSO GOING TO CHOOSE THE ONE THAT DOESN'T PUT. STUDENTS THROUGH A REALLY HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR MANY OF THEM. YEAH. THANK YOU AND THEN MISTER CHAIR OUT LAST QUESTION IF IF WE COULD ALLOW I THINK THE THE OPPOSITION -- OUTLINED IT THERE IS A COUNTER PROPOSAL THAT YOU WANTED. TO THE PROS PROPOSED TO THE AUTHOR THAT WASN'T AGREED UPON. THAT DOES THAT RELATE TO THE TO THE OPT OUT INTO THE OPT OUT YEAH CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT THAT. WELL WE CAN GO IN AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW -- HOW DISTRICTS IN HOW DO YOU PROPOSE ON PUTTING THE INFORMATION IN FULL RIGHT SO I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- BECAUSE OF FOR ME AND OUR DISTRICT -- AS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER WE HAVE TO PUT THE INFORMATION ON THE SYLLABUS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AND SO THIS STUDENTS KNOW WAY IN ADVANCE SPECIFICALLY ON CLASSES THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO DIE SECTION BECAUSE IT IS. A COLLEGE ARTICULATED CLASSES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL SO WE HAVE TO TELL THEM IN ADVANCE WHAT IS GOING ON THE OTHER THING THAT WE DO IN THE CLASSROOM. IS THAT WE DON'T START WAIT -- A CAT OR A LARGER ANIMAL WHAT WE DO IS WE ACTUALLY START WITH A BANANA. TO DEEPER LOOK AT DISSECTION NOT WAY WOULD POSITIONS AND AFTER THAT WE KIND OF MOVE UP. IN. I LOOK AT MY SCHOLARSHIP AND I LOOK AT MY STUDENTS AND I GROUP ON A CERTAIN WAY AND IF I FEEL LIKE THEY DO NOT. FEEL -- THAT THEY WANTED TO DO THAT THEY CAN DO A ROTATION. AND THE OTHER PARTIES IF THEY OPT OUT. THEN I GO IN AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE ASSIGNMENTS -- I ALWAYS DOUBLE VIRTUAL LAP BEFORE HIM BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THE ACTUAL DISSECTION THAT'S WHEN WE GO IN MORE AT DEEPER LEARNING AND CRITICAL THINKING ANALYSIS AND THAT YOU CANNOT DO. WHEN YOU'RE USING A A VIRTUAL LAP OR A VIDEO? BECAUSE IF EACH STUDENT IN MY CLASS HAVE A GROUPS. EACH STUDENT WITH A A HEART THAT THEY'RE DISSECTING COULD BE A VARIATION OF DIFFERENT SO WE CAN ASK THE QUESTION WHY IS THAT. WHY IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE HEART TO ONE ANOTHER IN DARKNESS PARKS TO INFLUENCE YOU KNOW THINKING LIKE WOW WHY IS THAT? IN SO IT GIVES SOME MORE INFORMATION AND TRY TO KIND OF COOL -- INCORPORATE OTHER POOR IDEAS THAT'S PART OF THE NEXT GENOCIDE STANDARDS AND THAT'S VARIATION IN TRAITS. THANK YOU. THE THANK YOU MISTER VERY THE DRUG -- THERE WAS A COMMENT YOU MADE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT REQUIRED -- AS A PART OF THE STATE STANDARDS THIS SECTION IS NOT IS THAT AND WHAT AS SUCH IS NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND SO. THE OPPOSITION IS ALLEGING THAT IT IS IS THAT CORRECT NO I DON'T BELIEVE. THAT ANYONE SAID. IT'S NOT THAT IT IS REQUIRED BUT BY THE NATURE OF THE SHIP'S DEMANDED WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEXT GENERATION SCIENCES IT LENDS ITSELF TO THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY OF FIVE MAY GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN MY FOURTH GRADE CLASSROOM. WE STUDY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF ANIMALS AND I HAVE A SECTION COMING UP WHEN I GO BACK TO TO SCHOOL. NEXT WEEK WHERE WE WILL BE DISSECTING CHICKEN Vì AND CHICKEN WINGS AND MY STUDENTS THEN USE WHAT THEY LEARN ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE TENDONS OF THE BONES. AND LIGAMENTS IN THE CHICKEN FEET AND WINGS TO THEN DESIGN A BIO AND THE BIONIC HAND THAT THEY USE SO THEY'RE TAKING THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY LEARN TO THAT I SECTION AND APPLYING IT IN AN ENGINEERING PROCESS AND NOT PART OF THE SHIPS. AND THIS IS IN WHAT WHAT GREAT FOR THAT RIGHT FOURTH GRADE OKAY OKAY -- IS -- MY CONCERN. IF THERE IS A CONCERN AYE AYE I LIKE TO SECTION WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL SO MAYBE THAT LITTLE GORY ABOUT THAT BUT I DID LIKE IT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO BE THERE TODAY THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO -- MY CONCERN IS IS IS MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT. I DON'T SEE DISSECTION OCCURRING IN EVERY SCHOOL. AND THAT'S MY REAL CONCERN NOT SO MUCH EVEN THAT SAY SECTION I DON'T SEE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THAT IS -- HANDS ON THAT INSPIRES AND MOTIVATES PARTICULARLY IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE THE LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC LEVEL AND SO THAT MY CONCERN IS IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF THAT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WOULD MAKE MORE OF IT AVAILABLE I'M NOT REALLY SURE BUT I KNOW THAT HAVING WORK WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF SCIENCE EXT PROGRAMS THAT EXTERNAL TO SCHOOLS. WITH HIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OR WHETHER IN ONE OF OUR INSTITUTES IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT THAT IS WHAT SPARKED THE INTEREST OF INNER CITY KIDS THE FACT THAT THIS IS SCIENCE ITS HANDS ON THEY CAN SEE IT -- WHETHER IT'S IN A VIDEO OR WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW -- WHETHER IT'S VIRTUAL -- THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN AND MAYBE VIRTUAL MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE -- THAT'S MY ANOTHER ISSUE ARE REYES I'M NOT SURE -- BECAUSE MAYBE THAT THE INSTRUCTORS HAVE SOME DIFFICULTIES THEMSELVES DEALING WITH THAT BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT IS THE THING THAT REALLY TURNS KIDS ON TO SCIENCE. AND TOO OFTEN OUR KIDS IT TURNED OFF BY CHALKING TALK WHICH IS. WHAT WE DO A LOT OF SO I AM NOT SURE IF THIS WILL HELP IT MAYBE IT WILL -- I LIKE MORE INFORMATION I MAY GIVE YOU I'LL GIVE YOU MY SUPPORT FOR THE DAY BUT I'M REALLY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT I WANT. HANDS ON SCIENCE. IN ALL CLASSROOMS BECAUSE WITHOUT IT I THINK OUR STUDENTS DO NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF BEING INSPIRED AND IT AND AND ABLE TO ASK THOSE CRITICAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU SAY YOUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO ASK. IN A CLASSROOM AND AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE HANDS ON EXPERIENCES THAT REALLY TURN KIDS ON A TO SCIENCE THEY'RE VERY TURNED OFF UNFORTUNATELY IN SCIENCE IS A VERY EXCITING FIELD. I AGREE WITH YOU DODD WEBER AND I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL TURN LIVES INCLUDING HANDS ON ALTERNATIVES TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THE INTERACTIVE ACTIVITY I ALSO AGREE WITH APPLY MANY SCHOOLS I DON'T DISSECT AND IF IT IS THE UNSURPASSED LEARNING TOOL -- THEN CLEARLY THE THEIR SCHOOLS ARE GETTING BY TEACHING WITHOUT DOING IT AND THERE ARE SOME SCHOOLS THAT USE TECHNOLOGY -- MEDICAL SCHOOLS -- CERTAINLY PROVIDE CRITICAL ANALYSIS USING TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT ARE FAR SURPASS THAT THAT THAT THAT -- SURPASS ANIMAL DISSECTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO ANIMAL SECTION -- AND YEAH AND SO THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO SPARK THAT CRITICAL ANALYSIS JUST FALLS THERE'S PLENTY OF HANDS ON OPPORTUNITIES TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITIES TO SPARK OF THAT INTEREST AND I AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO BRING THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY TO ALL OUR SCHOOLS. AND WE HAVE TO BRING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ALL OUR SCHOOLS -- IN SO I THINK THAT THE THERE'S OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY TO DO THAT -- WITH THIS BILL -- BECAUSE I I BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IN THE LONG TERM IT IS A COST SAVINGS TO SCHOOLS THAT OTHERWISE HAVE TO EVERY YEAR PURCHASE ANIMALS AND AGAIN. AS WE DISCUSSED -- PREVIOUSLY IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE DISTRICTS NUMBER ANIMALS AT THEIR PURCHASING THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT PROVIDING THIS. EDUCATIONAL AND I'M I'M VERY HAPPY THAT WE HAVE TEACHERS THAT ARE UP OF COMFORTABLE PROMOTE THE PRESENTING AND AND PROVIDING. OF A CURRICULUM AND IT IS A LESSON PLAN THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THEY THAT THEY BELIEVE THE STUDENTS ENJOY BUT ULTIMATELY EVEN WITH IT AS PREVIOUSLY STATED BY. SOME MCCARTY -- BUT WITH THE OPT OUT WHAT HAVE YOU LET'S THINK ABOUT THE REALITY OF OF TEENAGERS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL OR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN. BEING ASKED BY THEIR A THORNY FIGURE WHETHER THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING OPT OUT. A BOMB IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE I DID HAVE TO DO A DISSECTION I DIDN'T WANT. TO BUT I DID IT. BECAUSE WELL WHAT AM I GONNA DO ON ON A TWO YOUNG TEENAGE BOY GOING TO GO OUT IN THE PLAYGROUND AT RECESS. AND HAVE THE KIDS MAKE FUN EXCITED ONE OPT OUT TO BE A TO BE REALLY. THOUGHTFUL ABOUT ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS TO ACTUALLY PERFORM ANIMAL DISSECTION EVEN IF IT SPARKS INTEREST AND SOME. EVEN BUT TO PUT UP OR WHATEVER TO ACQUIRE A 100% TO DO IT OR TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES AND REST THE CLASS I THINK IS A PRETTY -- BUT IT'S AS A LOT TO ASK OF OUR STUDENTS -- AND I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE MORE POINT I DID MAKE IT EARLIER THAT THERE IS AN EXEMPTION FOR SPECIALIZED ACT CLASSES -- BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT I'VE CULTURE COMMUNITY THIRDS ARE UNIQUE FEELS THAT IT AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO GOING VETERINARY GOING INTO OBVIOUSLY RAISING LIVESTOCK WHAT HAVE YOU SO THERE IS AN EXEMPTION FOR SPECIALIZED HAD CLASSES. THANK YOU -- LET ME LET ME MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS -- YEAH I'M AN ANIMAL LOVER I'VE TO RESCUE DOGS AT HOME I'VE WORKED WITH SOCIAL COMPASSIONATE LEGISLATION -- AND WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT BILL JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT WE GOT THROUGH THAT WE DIDN'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH WE DID NOW I THINK IT'S THE NATIONAL MODEL -- BUT WHERE I FALL ON THIS IS. THIS ABSOLUTELY REMOVES LOCAL CONTROL. THIS ABSOLUTELY WILL COST MORE MONEY. THESE CLASSROOMS DO NOT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TODAY AND IN FACT IF YOU BUY SOFTWARE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT YOUR CHROMEBOOK RIGHT IT'S GOT TO BE ONLINE. SO AGAIN -- THIS IS COMING FROM A TEACHER SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM FOR MANY YEARS -- WE SHOULDN'T BE DESIGNING LESSON PLANS FROM SACRAMENTO. WE SHOULD ALLOW TEACHERS TO HAVE THE AUTONOMY SO THEY CAN BEST MEET THE NEEDS. OF THEIR STUDENTS SO LET ME GO THROUGH A COUPLE OTHER THINGS AGAIN INCREASED COSTS OF HER HE SAID DEFINITELY. WILL COST MORE MONEY AND WE EVEN DID SOME RESEARCH ON HOW MUCH A FROG COSTS. SO IT YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INTERESTING TOPIC THIS IS ONE I STRUGGLED WITH THE WHERE I FALL AGAIN IT IS THE LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE. AND TEACHER AUTONOMY AND ALSO WE WE SHOULDN'T BE TELLING TEACHERS EXACTLY HOW THEY CAN OR CAN'T TEACH WITHIN REASON. FROM SACRAMENTO [inaudible] OUR THERE'S ANOTHER IT'S BEEN BROACHED UPON BUT WE SHOULD. UNLOCK A CHILD'S INTEREST IN SCIENCE. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK DISSECTION MAY DO SOMETIMES AND THAT'S A GOOD THING WE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW. FACILITATING A CHILD'S INTEREST IN IN SCIENCE MIGHT WE MIGHT YOU KNOW THE CHILD MAY ULTIMATELY FIND THE CURE FOR CANCER. AND AGAIN WE WE SHOULD SUPPORT THAT IN IN DISSECTION I THINK. MAY DO THAT. AND AGAIN IT MAY NOT BUT AGAIN A STUDENT CAN DECIDE NOW THERE ARE OPT OUT PROVISIONS NOW. AND A LOCAL DISTRICT CAN DECIDE AS WELL NOW SO. I I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING -- WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE HERE I I ALSO HAVE SOME -- YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD GO AS AGAIN STRENGTHENING THE OPT OUT PROVISION. AND ALSO MAY BE REQUIRING THAT THE ANIMAL PARTS. COME FROM ANIMALS THAT WEREN'T SOURCED SPECIFICALLY FOR DISSECTION. I'M QUITE OPEN IN THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. I THINK THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES KNOWN DOESN'T HAPPEN SOMETIMES NOW -- AND AND AGAIN I I JUST FALL BACK ON THE LOCAL ARGUMENT. AND I I THE UNIVERSITY'S. THROUGH OUR RESEARCH THE UNIVERSITY'S. NOT NOT NOT JUST THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS DO USE. ANIMALS NOW AND I SECOND THEY ALSO USE PEOPLE [inaudible] AND I THINK I I I THINK I'VE SAID MY PIECE -- BUT I THINK I REALLY WHERE I FALLS A LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE THE TEACHER AUTONOMY ISSUE AND FOR SOMEONE COOPER SAY IT'S NOT GONNA COST MONEY YOU CAN JUST DO IT. I THINK IT'S VERY IRRESPONSIBLE WE HAVE. SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY RADICALLY UNDER FUNDED IN CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT -- WELL MISS SMITH ONE SPEAK AYE CULTURES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE BECAUSE AS WE'VE DISCUSSED I HAVE -- AS A MATTER OF MY PERSONAL BELIEF SYSTEM AND WHAT MY OWN CHILDREN EXPERIENCED IN THEIR SCIENCE COURSE WORK IN HIGH SCHOOL. I SEE THE NEED AND I DEFINITELY SEE THE NEED FOR STRENGTHENING THE OPT OUT COMPONENT FOR FOR SURE. NOW THIS WAS JUST ME DECIDING ANY ABSENT ANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS I THINK I'D BE TOTALLY THERE WITH YOU BUT AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED A DO HAVE. OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL ABOUT AND THE AUTONOMY OF A TEACHER PEDAGOGY IN THEIR OWN CLASSROOMS AND SO -- I I'M GOING TO BE WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE I I LIKE THE DIRECTION THAT THIS IS HEADED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- YOUNG STUDENTS LIKE MY OWN WHO REALLY HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT PERFORMING DISSECTION HAVE AN OPTION THAT IS AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO THEM THAT DIDN'T REQUIRE THEM TO STAY IN A CLASSROOM WHERE THEY FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE ACTIVITY THAT WAS GOING ON AND FELT THAT THEY GAINED. VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE FROM THAT PROCESS JUST BASED ON THEIR OWN PERSONAL OBJECTION SO. I THINK THERE ARE AND AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT A LOT OF AREAS THAT I THINK CAN BE WORKED ON HERE SO -- I I THINK THE AUTHOR I THINK THE OPPOSITION I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE ALL OF YOU TO WORK TOGETHER I DO THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE. THIS DYNAMIC CONTINUE TO CHANGE I MEAN WE KNOW ALREADY KIND OF THE MATERIALS THAT HAVE COME ONLINE AS WE ADOPTED NEW CURRICULUM ONCE IN GSS REALLY STARTS TO UNFOLD IN CLASSROOMS WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE I THINK. HANDS ON MANIPULATIVES THAT SPEAK EXACTLY TO THAT KIND OF COLLABORATIVE EXPERIENCE THAT I KNOW YOU WANT YOUR STUDENTS TO HAVE SO -- THAT SAID I JUST ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND ULTIMATELY LET'S DO WHAT'S BEST FOR STUDENTS LET'S TO DOCTOR WILL -- WEBBER'S CONCERNS OVER EQUITY LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE HAPPENING IN ALL OF OUR CLASSROOMS NOT JUST IN THOSE -- IN IN MORE AFFLUENT AREAS AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS IS MEANINGFUL IN A WAY THAT IT KNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESSES THOSE. THE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE STEM MOTIVATED BUT THEN ALSO FOR FOR KIDS LIKE MINE THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES STILL THAT MEANINGFUL SCIENCE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT BEING SUBJECTED. TO THE ACTIVITY THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU. BYE DO WE HAVE A MOTION. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- MR CALL ARE YOU MAKE CLOSE THE MOTION IS. DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU -- IT JUST ON A COUPLE OF THE POINTS AS I INDICATED I DON'T SUGGEST THAT IT'S THAT IT'S FOR YOUR DOESN'T COST ANYTHING THERE ARE SOME SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE FREE BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT. THERE WILL BE SOME COST INVOLVED HOWEVER MY CONTENTION IS THAT IT'S EITHER DEPENDING ON WHAT TECHNOLOGIES USE EITHER A WASH -- GONNA BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG TERM BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY CONTINUE TO BUY AND PURCHASE -- OF ANIMALS AS YOU DO WITH ANIMAL DISSECTION. AND SO. I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COST FACTOR IS ONE THAT SHOULD PREVENT GOING FORWARD ON THIS -- I ALSO BELIEVE THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE TO BE PARAMOUNT. AND I THINK THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY PEOPLE MAKE THE STUDENTS MIGHT REMEMBER THAT THEY CUT INTO AN ANIMAL -- AND MAY BE REMEMBER THAT LESSON PLAN -- REMEMBER DOING THAT IN SCHOOL BUT THERE ARE IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE. TO CREATE THAT CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND TO TEACH THE REALITY IS AGAIN ALLUDING TO ALMOST THREE DOZEN STUDIES IT SHOWS COMPARATIVE OR BETTER OUTCOME FOR THE STUDENT EDUCATIONALLY. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON BETTER OUTCOMES THAN ANIMAL DISSECTION. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE GET ATTACHED TO DOING THINGS A CERTAIN WAY AND I LOVE TEACHERS I LOVE THE FACT THAT DISSECTION HAS BEEN A CRITICAL PART OF MANY OF THEIR OF OF LESSON PLANS AND THE WAY THAT THEY TEACH FOR SO LONG. I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A TIME OR DISSECTION WILL NOT BE -- OF A COMMON PLACE -- AND I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE US IN THAT DIRECTION AS A STATE AND AS A NATION -- BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT -- WHEN IN TERMS OF EITHER GOING INTO COLLEGE THE THE ECOLOGICAL HABITAT OF ANIMALS OR CERTAINLY HARVESTING ANIMALS FOR THE PURPOSES AYE SECTION -- IS NOT GOOD FOR THE ANIMALS MILLIONS OF WHICH ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR NATIONWIDE -- FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISSECTION AND I DON'T BELIEVE IS GOOD FOR THE STUDENTS I DON'T THINK EXPOSING OR OR HAVING -- STUDENTS -- AND THERE ARE SOME STUDIES THAT SHOW AS MANY AS A THIRD OF THEM ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DOING IT BUT DO IT. THEY DON'T OPT UP EVEN EVEN WHEN GIVEN THE OPTION BECAUSE AGAIN BUT A LOT OF FACTORS INVOLVED INCLUDING HAVING YOUR AT ALREADY FIGURE. PUTTING FORWARD A LESSON PLAN -- APPEARS THAT ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING AS WELL AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL DESIRE TO TRY TO ACHIEVE IN ACADEMICS OF A AS MANY AS A THIRD OF THE STUDENTS FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THEY DO IT. AND I WOULD ALSO STATE THAT MANY STUDENTS THAT -- MAY GET SPARKED INTO SCIENCE -- CAN GET SPARKED IN MANY WAYS. TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL OF OPTIONS BUT I WOULD DOUBT THAT ANY STUDENT IS GOING TO BE TURNED AWAY FROM GOING INTO MEDICINE BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVES AND THERE ARE STUDENTS TO GET TURNED AWAY FROM THE SCIENCES. BECAUSE OF THE OF HAVING TO DISSECT AS OF SHIRLEY ABOUT FINDING SOMETHING THAT SPARKS INTEREST IN ALL STUDENTS WE SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT'S PARK STUDENTS IN EVERY. IN EVERY SINGLE STUDENT NOT NOT AT A PRACTICE OF NOT REQUIRED -- THAT -- THAT DOESN'T -- HAD A PARTICIPATE OR HAD THAT INTEREST SPARKED IF THEY GO INTO MEDICINE TO BE PLENTY OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISSECTION DOES ACTUALLY CADAVERS AND YOU NAME IT -- BUT I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY NOT TO SET A MORAL CENTER BUT I TECHNOLOGICAL STANDARD AS THE STATE TO MOVE US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND THE THE THE THE THE OPT OUT NO DOUBT NEEDS STRENGTHENING BUT EVEN SETTING THAT ASIDE THE PRACTICE ITSELF I DON'T BELIEVE BASED UPON THE RESEARCH IS AS EFFECTIVE AS THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT OF ALL THE MEMBERS HAVE GIVEN -- NOT JUST IN TODAY'S DEBATE BUT IN LEADING UP TO TODAY'S HEARING.
