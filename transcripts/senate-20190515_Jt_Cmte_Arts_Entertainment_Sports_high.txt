WHICH IS PART OF THE ART SAID OPPORTUNITY EQUATION YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE LIKE KIDS JUST DON'T KNOW OF ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS OUT THERE BECAUSE OF OF DIMINISH SOCIAL CAPITAL. IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND PART OF WHAT A GOOD ARTS EDUCATION DOES IS IS PROVIDE THEM WITH INSIGHTS INTO NEW THINGS THAT THEY CAN MOVE INTO. CAREER WISE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT. I CERTAINLY IS A LEGISLATURE WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD -- WITH THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IT'S IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS AS WE SPEAK -- I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES I SHARE MY SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PERMANENT INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS PRESENTED IN THE MAY REVISED -- THIS WILL BRING FUNDING LEVELS UP TO AN ESTIMATED TWENTY SIX MILLION WHICH IS REALLY. NOT HIGH ENOUGH BUT CERTAINLY IF THOSE OF US WHO KNOW THE RECENT HISTORY KNOW HOW MUCH HIGHER. THAT WAS THAT IS THEN THAT IN PREVIOUS YEARS.

ONE THANK YOU CENTER ISLAND -- AND MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE ARTS AND INVITED GUESTS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS -- AT THIS HEARING. BEFORE WE HEAR FROM OTHERS -- WITH PERSPECTIVES AND INSIGHTS ON THE STATE WIDE CRATER ECONOMY. I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THE LOTUS REPORT ON THE CRAVE ECONOMY AND ITS EVOLUTION AS A CRITICAL TOOL. FOR UNDERSTANDING THE WAYS IN WHICH THE LARGER ECONOMY IS INTRICATELY CONNECTED TO A CREATIVE. ONE THIS REPORT HAS BEEN CHRONICLING THE GROWTH AND BREADTH OF THE CRATER ECONOMY OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS AND IT WAS STARTED BY A FORMER PRESIDENT SAMUEL H<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</u> WHO WANTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TRUE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF A CREATIVE ECONOMY? THE COMMISSION THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION TO BENCHMARK MEASURE AND ASSESS TRENDS IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY IN THE LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY REGION. THE RESEARCH FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC CREATIVE SECTORS. IN ART DESIGN ENTERTAINMENT AND ARTS EDUCATION I MEASURE THEIR DIRECT INDIRECT IN INDUCED ECONOMIC IMPACT. FOLLOWING SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL THIS ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WITH EXTENDED BEYOND LOS ANGELES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LONG LONG RECOGNIZED AS A GLOBAL LEADER FOR CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. THIS YEAR WE HAVE NEW QUESTIONS AND COMMISSION BEGIN ECONOMICS TO RESEARCH AND WRITE THE REPORT AND YOU'LL SOON HEAR FROM ROBERT KLEIN HANDS ABOUT THE NEW FINDINGS. THIS REPORT HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED BY PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES AND THIRTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING AUSTRALIA ARGENTINA CANADA CHINA COLOMBIA ESTONIA FRANCE GONNA. INDIA INDONESIA IRAN. RUSSIA SOUTH AFRICA AND THAILAND TO NAME JUST A FEW IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA AND ITS CREDIT ECONOMY ARE FRONT AND CENTER IN A GLOBAL CONVERSATION. GIVE YOU A BROADER CONTEXT AND SET LIGHT ON WHY OTIS BECAUSE OF OUR DESIGN WOULD COMMISSION THIS REPORT I FIRST. I SHOULD FOR SHARE SOME KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLEGE. THIS YEAR WE CELEBRATE OUR CENTENNIAL THAT'S A HUNDRED YEARS OF EDUCATING ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS AND LOS ANGELES. IT WAS BEGUN AS A COUNTY INSTITUTION AND AND AND IS NOW A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGE. AND OUR MISSION IS TO PREPARE DIVERSE STUDENTS OF ARE DESIGNED TO ENRICH OUR WORLD THROUGH THEIR CREATIVITY SKILL AND VISION. OUR ALUMNI AND FACULTY ARE FULBRIGHT MACARTHUR GUGGENHEIM GRANT RECIPIENTS OSCAR AWARD THESE LEGENDARY COSTUME DESIGNERS LEADERS OF CONTEMPORARY ART MOVEMENTS ENTREPRENEURS ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS. APPLE PICKS ARE MET MATTEL NIKE AND DISNEY TO NAME A FEW. THIS WEEKEND WE GRADUATED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS FROM SEVEN BFA PROGRAMS IN ARCHITECTURE LANDSCAPE INTERIORS GREAT. COMMUNICATION ARTS DIGITAL MEDIA FASHION FINE ARTS PRODUCT DESIGN TÃ´I DESIGN AND FROM THREE GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND FINE ARTS AND ON THE EVE OF COMMENCEMENT WE HOLD OUR ANNUAL EXHIBITION WHEN WE INVITE THE PUBLIC RECRUITERS ALUMNI AND FAMILIES THE CAMPUS FOR TWO DAYS. TO MEET OUR GRADUATING STUDENTS TO SEE THEIR CULMINATING WORK AND TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE. I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THEM THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE CREATIVE ECONOMY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE NEWEST MEMBERS OF IT THE ONES THAT WE'VE MOST RECENTLY TRAIN TO GO OUT INTO IT. WE KNOW THAT WITHIN A YEAR 92% OF THEM WILL HAVE A WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELD OF STUDY. THE QUESTION I POSED TO EACH OF THE STUDENTS WAS WHETHER THEY KNEW THEIR FUTURE FIELD EXISTED WHEN THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SAID NO. MOST HAD LIMITED EXPOSURE FROM HIGH SCHOOL ART COURSES AND PAINTING AND DRAWING ONLY THOSE STUDENTS READ PARENTS IN CREATIVE INDUSTRIES NEW THESE CRAZY EXISTED. AND THEN I ASKED WHAT THEY WISH THEY HAD KNOWN. ONE STUDENT AND IN PRODUCT DESIGN TOLD ME SHE'D TAKEN NO FORMAL ART COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE ENROLLING IN OTIS. AND UNDER STANDING OF THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES WERE LIMITED TO FINE ARTS AND GRAPHIC DESIGN. SHE TOLD ME IN HIGH SCHOOL I WISH I KNEW THAT EVERYTHING AROUND US WAS DESIGNED. BY SOMEONE THAT THE WORLD IS BUILT ON DESIGN. A SIMILAR SENTIMENT WAS SHARED BY ERICA AND TOY DESIGN WHO ALWAYS LOVE TOY STORES BUT NEVER THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM DESIGNING THE TOYS. THAT LINED THE SHELVES. WHEN I AS LUKE AND DIGITAL MEDIA? HE TOLD ME I WISH I'D KNOWN THERE WAS AN INDUSTRY FOR WHAT I WAS INTERESTED IN DOING OR MATTHEW HIS COLLEAGUES WHO SAID MORE SPECIFICALLY I WISH I KNEW THAT MOTION DESIGN EXISTED. AND WITHIN MOTION DESIGNED THAT THERE IS A DIVERSITY OF STYLES TO WORK WITH AND WHEN I ASKED WHAT THEY WANTED ME TO TELL YOU QUINCY AND COMMUNICATION ARTS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND EARLY THAT OUR IS NOT LIMITED TO SHOWING IN A GALLERY. OR IN THE WHO SUGGESTED DESIGN COURSES BE OFFERED IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AS ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT IT IS. NOW WE MUST ASK HOW WE'RE PREPARING YOUNG PEOPLE FOR IT THESE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT NEW ROLES. NOT ONLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT MORE ARTS EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS. BUT TO LOOK EVEN DEEPER INTO HOW WE'RE TEACHING DIVERSE PROBLEM SOLVING DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND HOW WE'RE HELPING PARENTS UNDERSTAND THE MANY PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THEY MAY NEVER HAVE IMAGINED FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IF PARENTS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND CREATIVE FIELDS HOW CAN THEY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN IN SEEKING THEM. AND IMAGINE ALL THE CREATIVE MINDED STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEFT THE ARTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A FUTURE FOR THEM THERE. WE KNOW CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN ITS CREATIVE ECONOMY NOW WE HAVE TO ASK WHETHER IT WILL BE THE NATION PREPARING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR A TRULY REMARKABLE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU TO THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL WHO HAVE HELPED US WITH THE STATEWIDE ANALYSIS. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS HEARING. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM -- AND BROWN CRAWFORD IS THE DIRECTOR OF COVER ARTS COUNCIL AND YOU'RE SO WELCOME. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE SUMMER FUNDING. AS WE ALL ARE. YEAH -- GOOD MORNING. TO ALL OF YOU. APPEAR -- THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING TODAY AND FOR FRAMING AND THE WAY THAT IT'S FRAMED. AND AND FOR ALL THAT YOU DO TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN BENEFIT. FROM THE POWER OF CREATIVE EXPRESSION AND THE ARTS I'M AND BOUND CRAWFORD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. AT THE ARTS COUNCIL WE SAY CREATIVITY IS CALIFORNIANS. WE SAY THIS BECAUSE ARTS AND CULTURE ARE CENTRAL TO WHAT MAKES SAYS CALIFORNIANS CENTRAL TO OUR IDENTITIES TO OUR COMMUNITY VIBRANCY. INTO OUR RESILIENCE AS A PEOPLE LIVING IN SOCIETY TODAY WITH ALL OF ITS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITY. WE ALSO SAY CREATIVITY IS CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE WERE PRIVILEGED TO LIVE IN A STATE WITH ELECTED LEADERS WHO DEEPLY UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THE ARTS. AND TO UTILIZE THE ARTS AS A TOOL TO SERVE OUR STATE. THANK YOU. THE FIRST ARTIST REPORT STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT WAS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL FIVE YEARS AGO. THE REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE DATA FROM THAT OTIS REPORT FEATURES AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT RESONATES WITH POLICYMAKERS COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS AND OTHER FUNDERS WHO PROVIDE CRUCIAL SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIA'S CULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE DATA IS INVALUABLE WHEN SHARED HAND IN HAND WITH STORIES OF CHANGE PRESERVATION AND RESILIENCE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. AS WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE IN TODAY'S HEARING. WHEN THE FIRST STATEWIDE CREATIVE ECONOMY REPORT WAS PUBLISHED FIVE YEARS AGO OUR STATE GOVERNMENT INVESTED JUST ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE ARTS? AS YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER HAS GROWN BY MILLIONS EACH YEAR SINCE AND HOPEFULLY -- KEEP GROWING. I JUST THROW THEM -- QUANTIFYING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S CREATIVE ECONOMY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CATALYST FOR THIS LONG AWAITED RESURGENCE IN STATE ARTS REPORT SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA'S CREATIVE ECOSYSTEM IS UNLIKE THAT OF ANY OTHER STATE OR NATION. WE KNOW THAT LIKE ANY ECOSYSTEM OUR CREATIVE ECOSYSTEM THRIVES BECAUSE OF ALL COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. OUR CITIES ARE HUBS OF INNOVATION AND CREATIVE RESILIENCE WHERE THE ARTS ARE USED AS A TOOL TO PRESERVE THE PLACE OF ARTISTS AND CULTURAL COMMUNITIES. IN OUR RAPIDLY GROWING URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. AND OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE KNOWN INCUBATORS OF CREATIVE IDEAS AND TODAY THEY ARE A PLACE WHERE SOME ARTISTS AND CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS PURSUE A MORE ATTAINABLE QUALITY OF LIFE. FINDING INSPIRATION FROM CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL BEAUTY OR JUST A CHANGE OF PERSPECTIVE. OUR CREATIVE ECOSYSTEM ALSO DEPENDS GREATLY ON THE SECTORS THAT IS COMPRISED OF THERE ARE FIVE SECTORS DEFINED IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY REPORT. INCLUDING OF COURSE. NONPROFIT ARTS AND CULTURE AND ARTS EDUCATION. COMMUNITY ARTS PROGRAMS ARE WERE AND THEN TAKE CULTURE THRIVES. THEY ARE THE CORE OF OUR PIPELINE IN TALENT THEY ARE WERE SMALL AND MID SIZE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIANS TODAY THROUGH THE ARTS. THIS IS A SEGMENT OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY THAT I AM NOT SURPRISINGLY VERY INTERESTED IN AS THE HEAD OF A STATE ARTS AGENCY. WHERE MORE THAN 70% OF OUR CURRENT GRANTEES ARE ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE BUDGET UNDER ONE MILLION DOLLARS? BUT AS AN ARTS EDUCATOR WITH MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE I GOT. TO TAKE THAT NUMBER OUT AND WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. WORKING WITH STUDENTS WHO ENTER THE CREATIVE WORK FOR US AS DESIGNERS. ANIMATORS ILLUSTRATORS AND ENGINEERS I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN THE STRENGTH OF THE INTERSECTIONS OF OUR CREATIVE SECTORS. BUILDING ARTS EDUCATION MODELS HAS BEEN A HALLMARK OF MY CAREER. THE MOST EFFECTIVE MODELS HAVE BEEN PARTNERSHIPS BASED ON COLLABORATION WITH AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND IN COMMUNITY ART CENTERS. AND BUSINESS SETTINGS THAT CAN ALL CONNECT TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF A REGION AND OF THE STATE OVERALL. THESE PARTNERSHIPS CONCENTRATE ON ROBUST TO LEARNING AND THE TRANSFERABLE SKILLS NEEDED TO PROMOTE INNOVATION. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CREATIVITY. THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF WORK I NOW GET TO DO IN MY ROLE AS HEAD OF THE ARTS COUNCIL. SUPPORT FOR ARTS EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE LONGEST STANDING EFFORTS BY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN THE AGENCY WAS FIRST FORMED. CURRENT GRANT PROGRAM OFFERINGS HELP FUND TEACHING ARTISTS IN THE CLASSROOMS STUDENT FIELD TRIPS TO ARTS AND CALL. OTHER CULTURAL EXPERIENCES AND ARTS INTEGRATION TRAINING FOR TEACHERS. AND THIS YEAR THROUGH OUR NEWEST PROGRAM YOUTH ARTS ACTION WE WILL EXPAND THAT SUPPORT TO YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR CALIFORNIANS FROM AGES. ZERO TO TWENTY FOUR WE RECEIVE A HUGE DEMAND. FOR OUR ARTS EDUCATION GRANTS EVERY YEAR. ARTS EDUCATION PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN BUILDING THE PIPELINE FOR CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE CREATIVE ECONOMY. FOR ME MEANING FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM THE CENTER OF SO MUCH IT TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF OUR WORK AT THE ARTS COUNCIL WHETHER IT'S IN CORRECTIONS. CULTURAL DISTRICTS OR SUPPORTING COMMUNITY ARTS ORGANIZATIONS IT SAYS THAT THE CENTER OF A HEALTHY COMMUNITY OVERALL. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT TODAY'S HEARING IS ABOUT AT THE CORE BUILDING HEALTHY AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES STARTING WITH OUR USE. IT'S MY HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO LISTENING ALONG WITH YOU TO THE TESTIMONIES OF MY COLLEAGUES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. FOR THIS SPECIAL HEARING. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE POWER OF CREATIVE EXPRESSION AND THE ARTS -- OKAY OKAY. SELECT RENEE HERE FROM -- ROBERT KLEIN AND SEES -- GET A PRESENT. THIS POWER POINT EASY THE CARD FROM BEACON ECONOMICS. AND ALSO UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL BUSINESS CENTER AT THEIR CENTER FOR ECONOMIC FORECASTING AND HE'S. I THINK ANY GIVE US THE MOST. DATA HEAVY OF ALL THE PRESENTATIONS ARE HERE TO ASSIST ME A LITTLE LONGER -- BUT A LOT OF GREAT STUFF IN HERE AT A CHANCE TO REVIEW SOME OF THE MATERIALS AND OUR REALLY LOOKING FOR TO TO TO WHAT YOU FOUND. THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING US TO COME AND SPEAK TODAY -- ABOUT THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. IN A COURSE OUR THANKS FROM BEACON -- TO THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AND TO OTIS COLLEGE -- FOR HAVING US DO THIS THIS RESEARCH ON BEHALF OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PROJECT IN MY OPINION -- SO SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OR THE LED SEE THAT WAS WHEN THE IDEA. CAME UP OUT OF DOING A STUDY OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AT THE STATE LEVEL -- AND AND THERE'S STILL SO MUCH TO DO IN THIS VEIN BUT WILL CONTINUE TO PLUG AWAY -- AND ALSO -- YEARS AGO AND AND HAS JOBS I HAD OCCASION TO GO UP AND DOWN THE STATE THROUGH TRAVELS AND AND TO SEE AND CITIES AND COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL HOW THE ARTS. BUT IT'S A COMMUNITY THEATER OR SOME OTHER MANIFESTATION REALLY IS A PART OF EACH AND EVERY COMMUNITY HERE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE LARGE AND SMALL SO -- LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THE TECHNOLOGY TO WORK IF THAT WAS THE WRONG BUTTON TO PRESS [inaudible] SORRY. THANK YOU OKAY SO -- I'M LOOKING FOR TO PRESENT THE FINDINGS OF THIS MOST RECENT -- OTIS -- REPORT ON THE CREATIVE ECONOMY SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT -- THE THE ARTS -- WE THINK OF FINE ARTS PERFORMING ARTS AND SO ON AND THE EDUCATION ASPECT BUT IN THIS. CONTEXT OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY WE'RE GONNA STRETCHER THINKING GO BEYOND THE ARCH TO COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF DESIGN AND CREATIVITY. WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ARTS AS WE COMMONLY. THINK OF THEM WERE THINKING ALSO ABOUT INDUSTRIES WHERE. DESIGNING CREATIVITY IS -- IS AT AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OR AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT. TO WHAT THEY DO SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AS WELL NOT JUST AT THE DESIGN BUT ALSO. THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE PRODUCTION OF SERVICES AS WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION SOME CASES -- BECAUSE THE LINES BLUR WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIES -- IT WHEN WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OF THESE INDUSTRIES WILL LOOK AT THE STATE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT TO THE REGIONAL -- WE ALSO ROLLED IN TO THIS REPORT -- MORE ABOUT CREATIVE OCCUPATIONS -- SLICING AND DICING -- THE BREAK DOWN BY -- WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION -- ETHNIC PARTICIPATION SO. ONE SO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EVEN TWENTY MINUTES IS NOT ENOUGH TO TO REALLY SUMMARIZE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOME ODD PAGE REPORT -- AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST THERE'S THIS BROADER ECO SYSTEM -- INVOLVING ARTS EDUCATION THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF -- THEY WILL TALK ABOUT AS WELL SO. WE JUST WANT TO SAY WE'RE REALLY PROJECT OF THE REPORT CAME TO US UNREDACTED. ALL ABOUT -- TRANSPARENCY. SO IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE THIS REPORT FROM YEARS PAST THERE WERE SOMEWHERE ELEVEN OR TWELVE IN THIS LARGE INDUSTRY GROUPS WE CONSOLIDATED. THOSE GROUPS INTO FIVE THIS TIME AROUND I THINK THEIR SELF EXPLANATORY WHAT YOU SEE UP HERE ON THE SCREEN WE'VE GOT ARCHITECTURE AND RELATED SERVICES -- ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA FASHION. FINE AND PERFORMING ARTS AND THEN WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED CREATIVE GOODS AND PRODUCTS WHICH MIGHT BE THE MOST -- HARD TO DIGEST BUT THIS IS REALLY -- FURNISHINGS LIGHTING A WHOLE ARRAY OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW GOING TO OUR HOMES FOR EXAMPLE. AS WELL AS TOYS WHICH YOU KNOW THAT'S ABIG PART OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AS WELL -- SO THERE ARE OVER SIXTY INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE UP THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND THEY BREAK DOWN I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO READ BUT THEY BREAK DOWN ROUGHLY -- HALF BEING IN ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA -- THEN WE HAVE A NUMBER IN THAT CREATIVE GOODS AND PRODUCTS CATEGORY FASHION IS PROMINENT -- DOWN BELOW IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT YOU HAVE ARCHITECTURE RELATED SERVICES AND THEN FINE AND PERFORMING ARTS -- SO. BIG PICTURE -- WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENTS BASED ON DATA FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS CREATIVE NOW THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO STOP AND SAY WELL. HOW DID WE ARRIVE AT THIS LIST OF INDUSTRIES THAT? WE CONSIDER TO BE CREATIVE -- THERE'S REALLY NO STANDARD -- ANYWHERE IN ACADEMIC OR OTHER LITERATURE THAT ESTABLISHES. ONE SET OF INDUSTRIES TO BE -- CONSTITUTED AS CREATIVE OR NOT BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS A WHILE WE WE DID LITERATURE REVIEW SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WE DID IT AGAIN THIS YEAR TO DETERMINE WHICH INDUSTRIES -- ARE TYPICALLY CONSIDERED BEING A PART OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND WE USE THAT AS THE BASIS FOR IDENTIFYING INDUSTRIES IN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT DATA -- BY INDUSTRY CODE AGGREGATING THEM INTO THESE -- THESE CATEGORIES AND THEN WE CAME UP WITH THESE ESTABLISHMENT EMPLOYEE AND AND THAT SHOULD BE AVERAGE. AVERAGE ANNUAL WAGE -- NUMBERS THAT YOU SEE HERE FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE EIGHTY THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENTS MOSTLY IN ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA. OVER A MILLION -- WAGE AND SALARY WORKERS SO -- AN ASTERISK ON THAT POINT IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- TO FREELANCERS AND SO ON INCLUDED IN THAT NUMBER BUT IT'S ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IT'S JUST COMES FROM A DIFFERENT DATA SOURCE. AND THE THE PAYROLL NUMBERS I APOLOGIZE IT SHOULD BE AVERAGE WAGE AND HAD JUST FOR REFERENCE IT'S A HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THE AVERAGE WAGE -- FOR THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR AVERAGE WAGE. FOR ALL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE PERIOD. TWO THOUSAND IT'S ONE OH TWO RATHER THAN. ONE THIRTY FOUR OKAY -- SO. IN TERMS OF THE INDUSTRIES AND THEIR CHANGES OVER TIME YOU CAN SEE THAT -- FEW INDUSTRIES HAVE SEEN GROWTH IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS OVER TIME SOME HAVE SEEN DECLINE AT THE VERY TOP YOU GET ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA. THINK ABOUT THIS.NEXUS BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND AND ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL ALL THINGS DIGITAL THESE DAYS A LARGE SHARE OF THE GROWTH IN THE STATEWIDE ECONOMY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS COME FROM THE TECH SECTOR. AND IT SPILLED OVER INTO THIS ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR THAT WE HAVE HERE SO 22% GROWTH IN ESTABLISHMENT SO -- IN THAT SECTOR AND THEN OTHERS GROWTH THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE FOR EXAMPLE WITH CREATIVE GOODS AND AND ARTS AND ARCHITECTURE. HAVE TO DO WITH THE ECONOMIC CYCLE AND HAVE TO DO WITH GROWTH IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. SO. YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT EACH ONE OF THESE INDUSTRIES WHERE INDUSTRY GROUPS AND YOU CAN KIND OF FIGURE OUT WELL HOW MUCH OF THIS IS DUE -- TO UNDER -- UNDERLYING TRENDS IN THE ECONOMY HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THESE CHANGES ARE DUE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING UNIQUELY TO THAT INDUSTRY -- FASHION IS HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD MANUFACTURING AND MANUFACTURING HAS LOST BOTH ESTABLISHMENT IN EMPLOYMENT. OVER THE LAST -- SEVERAL DECADES REALLY SO -- TO BE FLAT OVER THIS TIME PERIOD IS IS NOT ALL THAT BAD. AND CREATIVE IN GOOD CREATIVE GOODS AND PRODUCTS ALSO A MANUFACTURING HEAVY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY SO WE'RE SAYING JOBS BEING DISPLACED BY TECHNOLOGY. MAYBE MOVING OVERSEAS BUT MORE SO DISPLACEMENT BY TECHNOLOGY SO INTO THE ESTABLISHMENT COUNTS LOWER COMPARED -- 220-002-00010. JOB CANCER GENERALLY HIGHER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FASHION -- CONSIDERING WHAT -- WE HAVE SEEN -- IT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES BUT THESE OTHER SECTORS ECONOMY OVER THIS TIME PERIOD WHICH ARGUABLY IS RIGHT. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY -- WE HAVE SEEN GROWTH -- TO VARYING DEGREES AND IT'S IT'S GUEST JUDGE JOBS ARE OF MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE IN GENERAL ARE IN DECLINE -- SO IT'S NOT JUST MANUFACTURING BUT EVEN AEROSPACE FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME OF THOSE JOBS ARE BEING DISPLACED BY TECHNOLOGY SOME OF MY JUST MOVING OUT OF STATE BECAUSE OF HIGHER WAGES. OR MAYBE MOVING OUT OF COUNTRY. SO THAT'S SEE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH FASHION WE STILL HAVE THE DESIGN ASPECT IS PRESENT IN. ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR. OVERALL CREATED ECONOMY JOB GROWTH IS ACTUALLY EXCEEDED THE NON CREATIVE SIDE OF THE ECONOMY VERSUS ABOUT 21% EVEN ESTABLISHMENT GROWTH AND OVERALL HE'S BEEN SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE THE NON CREATIVE SIDE OF THE ECONOMY. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT TERM TO USE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT CREE WITH. FOR YOU KNOW BIFURCATING AN TO CREATE A NON CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRESENTATION. WAGE GROWTH HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT IN THE CREATIVE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY AGAIN YOU SAW EARLIER THAT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND WAGE NUMBER IT SHOULD OF AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE FOR THEIR AND SO YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA. IS PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN THIS GROWTH AND IT'S WHAT AND IT'S NOT JUST WHAT OUR KIDS ARE DOING TODAY. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE UP ON THE SCREEN WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- BUT WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE AND SO MANY GENERATIONS -- OF OF CALIFORNIANS AND AROUND THE WORLD ARE DOING TODAY WE'VE GOT. WHAT WE'RE CALLING DIGITAL DESTRUCTION IS ENTERTAINMENT -- VIRTUAL REALITY IS MAKING ITS WAY INTO A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES AT THIS TIME -- ANY NUMBER OF OTHER KINDS OF ASPECTS OF WHAT MAYBE ORIGINATED AS SOME ASPECT OF OF ENTERTAINMENT HAVE MADE THEIR WAY INTO OTHER INDUSTRIES AND ARE AFFECTING OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THIS IS JUST THE THE BEGINNING. I WOULD SAY OF A TRANSFER MAYES TRANSFORMATION THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING SO WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS THE STATE GEOGRAPHICALLY -- A LITTLE OVER HALF OF THE JOBS. IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A LA IN ORANGE COUNTY -- AND THEN ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE ABOUT A THIRD OR IN THE BAY AREA. THEN YOU HAVE JOBS ELSEWHERE THROUGHOUT THE OTHER REGIONS OF THE STATE AS WELL -- UPSTATE CALIFORNIA'S WHERE WE WILL START BECAUSE IT PROBABLY -- RARELY GETS. FIRST BILLING HAS ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED JOBS IN WHAT WE HAVE TO FIND TO BE THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. YOU'LL SEE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT EACH OF THESE THAT -- THERE'S SOME PRETTY COMMON TREND ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA TENDS TO BE MAKE UP A LARGER SHARE FOLLOWED BY -- CREATIVE GOODS AND PRODUCTS. ENTERTAINMENT DIGITAL MEDIA. ACROSS THE REGIONS OF THE STATE GENERALLY HAVE BEEN ADDING JOBS ALTHOUGH YOU'LL SEE BY LOOKING AT THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. THAT THIS -- PART OF THE STATE ACTUALLY LOST JOBS AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LOSS OF TRADITIONAL MEDIA BECAUSE WE HAVE. AMONG OTHER THINGS OF NEWSPAPERS. AND THAT TYPE OF TRADITIONAL MEDIA IS A PART OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA -- CATEGORY. CULINARY ARTS PART OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY IS A GREAT QUESTION WE'VE BEEN BANDING THAT AROUND AND THOSE OF US WHO ENJOY FOOD THINK IT'S WORTH. THINKING ABOUT IT AND SO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE SOME OTHER INDUSTRIES AS AND YEAH -- SO THAT CERTAINLY IS IS A CANDIDATE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH -- AND IN MY OWN COMMUNITY THERE A HIGH SCHOOL A MAGNET HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS JUST ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CULINARY ARTS AND HOSPITALITY [inaudible] SO -- YOU'LL NOTICE THE FINE ARTS AND PERFORMING ARTS IS UP WHICH IS A GOOD SIGN THIS ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED JOBS IN THIS AREA OF MOVING ALONG -- WE MOVED. TO THE CAPITAL REGION ARE HOME TO A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND JOBS AGAIN HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA ALSO THE AREA WHERE WE'VE SEEN. THE GREATEST GROWTH OCCUR -- AND AND I COULD SPEND TIME ON EACH ONE OF THESE -- AGAIN AS A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR PAGE REPORT SO -- UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T TALK ABOUT EACH AND EVERY DETAIL OF THE BAY AREA WELL OVER A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY -- AND YOU CAN YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT 70% OF ENTERTAINMENT DIGITAL MEDIA IS THERE ARE PARTS OF WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE TACK. THAT ALSO BELIEVE OVER INTO THIS SECTOR OF THE THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AS WELL AS THESE OTHER CATEGORIES -- THAT YOU SEE HERE. JOB. ABOUT. THE AND THOSE WHO ARE A SOLE PROPRIETOR SO IN THESE FIGURES YOU'RE SAYING JUST A WAGE AND SALARY EMPLOYEES -- THERE IS THERE ARE SEPARATE BREAK OUT OF THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THE SELF EMPLOYED IN THE RIVER IN THE BODY OF THE REPORT ITSELF SO -- AGAIN THEN THE CENTRAL COAST -- HOME TO ABOUT -- TWENTY THOUSAND CREATIVE SECTOR JOBS -- AGAIN THE PATTERN IS QUITE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN ELSEWHERE -- BUT YOU'RE SEEING THEIR THAT ARCHITECTURE IS THE ONE THAT IS LEADING THE WAY IN TERMS OF JOB GAINS -- AND THEN WE MOVED TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OF LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT STORY THERE IS WE'RE SEEING SOME CONTRACTION IN ENTERTAINMENT. AND I DON'T MEAN TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT I THINK IT'S DUE TO THE DECLINE OF TRADITIONAL MEDIA IN THESE INSTANCES WHERE IT IS -- SEEING A TO DECREASE THE INLAND EMPIRE IS AN AREA THAT IS RICH IN MANUFACTURING SO IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE TO SEE. THAT FASHION AND CREATIVE GOODS AND PRODUCTS ARE BOTH -- ON THE RISE IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA OF THE STATE -- AND THEN AS WE MOVE A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG -- TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LA ORANGE COUNTY REGION HOME TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE ONE MILLION JOBS IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- YOU CAN SEE THAT. THE LION'S SHARE OF THE GAINS HAVE OCCURRED IN. THIS ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA AREA SO YOU KNOW THIS THAT PARTICULAR CATEGORY HAS REALLY CHANGED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- GONE ARE THE DAYS OF FILM PRODUCTION GONNA THE DAYS OF YOU KNOW LARGE SCALE GONE BUT THEY HAVE TO THEIR NOW MAKING ROOM FOR SMALLER SCALE PRODUCTION COMPARED -- TO YEARS PAST YOU CAN SEE THE FASHION DECLINE THAT'S MANUFACTURING. OF SOMEWHAT ARGUE THAT IT MAY BE -- DUE TO THE INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL -- BUT THERE WERE OTHER FORCES ALREADY UNDER WAY THAT HAVE DRIVEN THAT -- THAT DECLINE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- BUT DO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DESIGN ASPECT CONTINUES TO BE FRONT AND CENTER IN PLACES LIKE THE BAY AREA AND IN LA. IN ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE IT'S THAT CREATIVE COMPONENT THAT YOU KNOW DIFFERENTIATES CALIFORNIA'S. ECONOMY AND THE SECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WE ACTUALLY DO CHECK. TO SEE HOW WE STACK UP AGAINST NEW YORK STATE AND I GUESS THE THE NEW YORK CITY REGION AND WE CAN SAFELY SAY WERE THEIR CREATIVE CAPITAL. OF THE UNITED STATES. JUST THROW THAT IN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BOTH CREATORS LIKE ACTORS TRADE. CRAFT. AND ANCILLARY FOLKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THIS WORK LIKE WRITERS PRODUCERS AGENTS OR WE JUST FOCUS OKAY YES HOWEVER -- A NUMBER OF THE OCCUPATIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED -- YOU MAY FIND SOME OF THE HIGH HIGH PROFILE INDIVIDUALS ARE. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR THAT THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OF SOME ENTITY SO THEY MAY NOT BE SHOWING UP HERE BUT YOU'RE PICKING UP WE'RE PICKING UP THE LINE SURE OF THE INDIVIDUALS. THERE COMPENSATION AND ALL THAT SO EVEN IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE SEE CONTINUED GROWTH -- IT ACROSS THE BOARD AND I I YOU KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT AMONG OTHER THINGS. FOR ALL OF US HERE TO SEE IS IT FINEARTS AND PERFORMING ARTS CONTINUES TO ADD TO ITS JOB COUNTS. THIS IS AN AREA THAT IS VERY MUCH TIED TO THE UPS AND DOWNS OF ECONOMIC CYCLES -- PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES ALSO VERY MUCH TIED TO THE UPS AND DOWNS OF ECONOMIC CYCLES SO. THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW SEVERAL YEARS INTO THIS ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND WE'RE GENERALLY SEEING GROWTH IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF JOBS NUMBER ESTABLISHMENTS. IN THE FINE ARTS AREA IS. CERTAINLY GOOD TO SEE YEAH. PLAY A ROLE IN THE CALCULATION FOR FINER. AUCTION HOUSES. THESE YOU KNOW -- I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE I'M THINKING THAT THERE AND SOME PART OF SALES -- OF ART SO. I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK THANK YOU FOR THAT. WAGES ARE GENERALLY HIGHER IN EACH OF THE CREATIVE SECTORS -- COMPARED. TO THE ECONOMY OVERALL THIS HAPPENS TO BE A COMPARISON OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST LA COUNTY -- JUST SO YOU CAN SEE OTHER TO STACK UP AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THE AVERAGE WAGE BASED ON THE DATA THAT WERE USING FOR THIS -- REAP MOST OF THIS REPORT THE AVERAGE WAGE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS ABOUT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. OKAY SO WE DIDN'T JUST LOOK AT INDUSTRIES WE ALSO LOOKED AT OCCUPATIONS AND WE USE A DIFFERENT DATA SOURCE SPECIFICALLY ON OCCUPATIONS. TO CALL THIS OUT AND OUT WHILE WE DO TALK ABOUT THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND AND LARGELY TALK ABOUT THOSE INDUSTRIES WE ALSO SPEND TIME IN THE REPORT AND HERE. TALKING ABOUT THE OCCUPATIONS AND OF COURSE. WITH THIS FIGURE TELLS US IS THAT. NOT EVERY INDUSTRY SOME INDUSTRIES ARE CREATIVE OTHERS ARE NOT. SOME OCCUPATIONS ARE CREATIVE OTHERS ARE NOT I HATE TO SAY IT THAT WAY -- AND SO. WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THERE ARE CREATIVE OCCUPATIONS IN NON CREATIVE INDUSTRIES AND VICE VERSA RIGHTS YOU HAVE ACCOUNT -- TO TAKE CARE THE BOOKS FOR LET'S SAY THE BILLMAHER NICK OUR ORCHESTRA AND NOW BY THE SAME TOKEN FOR AN ACCOUNTING FIRM HE MAY HAVE A GRAPHIC DESIGNER WHO DESIGNS THE REPORTS AND PUBLICATIONS AND SO ON SO. WHERE WE WERE JUST TRYING TO SPELL THAT OUT AND -- YOU KNOW. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT I THINK -- YOU KNOW I HAVE COLLEGE AGE KIDS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR FUTURE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AN AFGHAN ANYONE WHO'S THINKING ABOUT AN OCCUPATION WE WE HEARD THESE STORIES ABOUT THE RECENT GRADUATES FROM LOTUS. YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEIR PLACE WILL BE IN THIS WORLD AND UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN BE A CREATIVE BUT MAYBE FIND. EMPLOYMENT NOT JUST IN THE CREATIVE SECTOR BUT ELSEWHERE IS SO IMPORTANT -- TO UNDERSTANDING THE THE LANDSCAPE [inaudible] SO [inaudible] YEAH RIGHT. AND SO VERY QUICKLY THE THE TRENDS THAT WE IT. EXAMINE SHOWED THAT -- WE TEND TO HAVE. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND COLLEGE GRADUATES IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES -- OVER TIME WE'VE SEEN A GROWTH AND GROWTH IN THE LEVEL OF ACADEMIC ATTAINMENT AMONG THOSE WORKING IN THE INDUSTRIES. AND ALSO IF WE WERE TO COMPARE THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES AGAINST THE NON CREATIVE INDUSTRIES -- WE WOULD FIND HIGHER LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES -- DIVERSITY IS SOMETHING WE EXAMINED -- THE SHARE OF WOMEN ANY -- SECTORS OF THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY IS NOT A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COMPARED -- TO TEN TWO THOUSAND TEN OR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ABOUT 40% OF AL WORKERS -- THERE'S SOME SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN THE EARNINGS ON THE PART OF WOMEN RELATIVE TO MEN. BUT IT IS REALLY A A PRETTY CONSISTENT REFLECTION OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY AT THE PRESENT TIME. AND WITH RESPECT TO ETHNICITY I THINK -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT HUGE CHANGES IN THE SHARES OF OF MINORITIES WHO ARE IN. THE CREATIVE ECONOMY -- AND NOR ANY BIG CHANGE IN THE SHARE OF WHITE NON HISPANICS SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S EVOLVING WITH THE STATEWIDE WORKFORCE. PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN. FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE. YOU LOOK AT COLLEGE DEBT. WE DID NOT WE DID NOT LOOK AT COLLEGE THAT WE JUST LOOKED AT THE LOW. THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. USING AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA WHICH SHOWS AS A PEOPLE -- BY OCCUPATION AND BY EDUCATIONAL. SO THERE'S THIS BROADER -- ECO SYSTEM THE CREATIVE AN ECO SYSTEM THAT WE I WHICH WE'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON THE TOP ONE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT LESS ON SOMEWHAT LESS ON THE NONPROFIT ARTS ORGANIZATIONS BUT WE DO TO DELVE INTO THAT. A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE REPORT. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS GOVERNMENT POLICY MAKERS AND THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY EACH OF THESE WE TOUCH ON IN THE REPORT -- AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME JUST SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ON EACH WE LOOKED AT AND ESTABLISH THAT THERE WERE. OVER -- ELEVEN THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENTS IN. THE ARTS CULTURE AND HUMANITIES SEGMENT OF THE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WITH OVER -- EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS SO HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IN ANY ENTITY THAT HAD TO FILE A A NON PROFIT REPORT ESSENTIALLY WITH. THE IRS AND SO THERE ARE MANY SMALL NON PROFITS THAT HAVE RECEIPTS THAT ARE FAR. TOO SMALL. FOR REPORTING PURPOSES SO THE ELEVEN THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENT COUNTY IS PROBABLY A GROSS UNDERESTIMATE. THE NUMBER OF ASSETS YOU KNOW MOST OF THE ASSET BASE IS GOING TO BE FOUND IN LARGE. INSTITUTIONS LIKE MUSEUMS AND THEATERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY CLOSE TO THE MARK. AND HE RECEIPTS ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNDERESTIMATE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE WERE UNDER REPRESENTING. THE THE VERY SMALL -- ENTITIES THAT ARE PART OF THIS UP. WITH RESPECT TO ARTS EDUCATION WE'VE SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT OVER THIS TIME SPAN FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN IN TERMS OF F. T. E. EQUIVALENT SO THAT'S THE THE NUMBER OF FACULTY -- AVERAGE CLASS SIZE HAS ACTUALLY DECREASED OVER THAT TIME SPAN -- AND ENROLLMENTS HAVE HAVE ACTUALLY DECLINED PART OF THAT I WOULD SAY HAS TO DO WITH THE SHEER DEMOGRAPHICS READ APPOINT TIME AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW. WHERE CALIFORNIA'S K. THROUGH -- TWELVE POPULATION IS ACTUALLY FLAT OR DECLINING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. OKAY SO -- THE ECONOMIC IMPACT WHICH IS REALLY. IT'S NOT THE CENTRAL REASON WHY THIS STUDY IS BEING DONE I THINK JUST UNDERSTANDING THE THE CONNECTIONS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES -- IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT BUT THIS MIGHT BE CALLED THE ICING ON THE CAKE SO WHEN WE DO AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS OF AN INDUSTRY. OR ANYTHING ELSE WE MEASURE THE IMPACT IN TERMS OF JOBS WAGES AN OUTPUT. WHAT WE DO IS WE TRY TO TRACE THE RIPPLE EFFECT THROUGH THE ECONOMY OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT? KICKED IT ALL OFF SO IN THIS CASE. THE ACTIVITIES ARE OF THOSE FIVE MAJOR -- INDUSTRY GROUPS AND THEIR THEIR COMPONENT INDUSTRIES WE USE THE JOB COUNTS FROM EACH OF THOSE INDUSTRIES AS THE TRIGGER IF YOU WILL [inaudible] THAT -- REPRESENTS HIS INITIAL -- STIMULUS TO THE LOCAL AND STATE ECONOMY -- WHICH IS CALLED THE DIRECT EFFECT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS -- YOU THINK OF SUPPLY CHAIN AND YOU THINK OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. LET'S SAY A MUSEUM OR THEATER DECIDES THAT HE NEEDS TO REMODEL ITS FOR YANG ITS IT'S IT'S LOBBY. SO IT'S GONNA HIGHER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY AND THAT CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES IN TURN GOING TO TURN TO ITS SUPPLIERS. TO REQUISITIONMATERIALS AND SO ON THAT'S THAT INDIRECT EFFECT SO THAT'S THE FIRST THE NEXT STEP IN THAT RIPPLE EFFECT THROUGH THE GENERAL ECONOMY. MEANWHILE BOTH THE MUSEUM AND THE CONSTRUCTION FIRM HAVE EMPLOYEES AND THOSE WORKERS EARNED WAGES THAT THEY SPEND -- THE SPENDING OUT OF THAT WAGES OUT OF THOSE WAGES THAT ENTERS THE STATEWIDE ECONOMY IS THE SO CALLED INDUCED TO FACT. SO WE TRACK EACH OF THOSE USING A MODEL OF THE STATE ECONOMY THAT HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED INDUSTRIES. AND SO WHAT WE GET IS THAT WHEN WE START WITH A MILLION JOBS PLUS -- THROUGH THIS RIPPLE EFFECT IT -- RESULT IN TWO POINT SIX MILLION JOBS OVER ALL THAT ARE -- CREATED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY -- IN ON THE FAR RIGHT HAND SIDE THE OUTPUT IMPACT SO WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMY THE STATE ECONOMY AS YOU KNOW IS THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD -- LITTLE OVER TWO TRILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT -- WE START WITH THE OUTPUT THIS IMPLIED BY THOSE ONE MILLION JOBS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THROUGH THIS RIPPLE EFFECT -- ABOUT -- HALF OF I'M SORRY HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS. OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT RESULTS FROM THIS CREATIVE ECONOMIES WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE ECONOMY ULTIMATELY THAT IS TOUCH SO IT'S NOT WE CAN'T CLAIM ALL OF THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THE THAT THE CREATIVE ECONOMY START WITH THOSE MILLION ONE MILLION JOBS BUT THERE'S A CONTRIBUTION AFFECT TO THE TO THE REST OF THE ECONOMY. THAT AMOUNTS TO TWO POINT SIX MILLION JOBS AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS WHICH BY ANY MEASURE IS AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER. SO ARE A LOT OF INFORMATION TO HAVE PRESENTED TO YOU ODAY I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE -- GO GO BACK TO YOU KNOW THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON WHY WE'RE MEETING HERE TODAY WE HAVE. THIS -- THIS ARTS COMMUNITY. ARTS EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART AND PARCEL OF EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I I JUST AND AND SO I SAY LARGE AND SMALL WE'VE GOT A CON I AN ORGANIZATION AS LARGE AS THE LA COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY AND I JUST HAPPEN TO FIND IN ALPINE COUNTY WHICH IS THE SMALLEST BY POPULATION HERE IN THE STATE THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE BEAR VALLEY MUSIC FESTIVAL THAT OCCURS EVERY YEAR. SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF CREATIVE ACTIVITIES AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES -- IVORY ITED A NUMBER OF NUMBERS SEVERAL NUMBERS WHAT WE DO IS OR WHAT. THROUGH THE THROUGH A CONVERSATION THEY WERE PUTTING A FACE ON THOSE NUMBERS AS WELL. AND TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IS -- IT'LL CONTINUE TO BE A DYNAMIC FORCE -- IT IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT IN SO MANY WAYS IT'S AFFECTING THE OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT WE HAVE. THE BETTER -- SO KEY TO OUR STATE WIDE ECONOMY AND I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT STEM TO STEAM FOR MANY YEARS NOW. AND I THINK IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE APPARENT AS TIME PASSES HOW. THESE TWO ARE LINKED -- THE THE TACK ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS. OUR LINK TO THE ART SIDE OF THE WORLD [inaudible] AND THAT'S MORE TRUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAN ANY PLACE ELSE ON THE PLANET. SO ON THAT NOTE I WILL SAY THANK YOU -- THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU -- AND WELCOME BY THE WAY YEAH. YES AS A MEMBER. YEAH MICHAEL TODAY I HAD LOTS OF COFFEE DOES. YOU KNOW SO I'M. I ACTUALLY STARTED READING THAT REPORT COMING OUT OF OTIS WHEN IT FIRST STARTED -- AND SO VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS TOPIC IN THIS CONVERSATION YOU KNOW MANY FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. ARE EITHER SOLE PROPRIETORS OR THEY ARE -- OWNERS OF A VERY SMALL BUSINESS WITH LESS THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES. AND SO WONDERING IF IN YOUR SORT OF ECONOMIC CONVERSATION IF YOU'RE EVER THINKING ABOUT -- THE TAX BURDEN THAT IS PLACED ON MANY OF THESE FOLKS AND WE OFTENTIMES OR TALKING ABOUT TAXES THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT CAN BE ABSORBED BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY MAKES A TON OF MONEY AND IS A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR. OR BECAUSE IT'S A BUSINESS THAT HAS A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND KIND OF WEATHER THE STORM BUT FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESSES. I'VE BEEN HEARING ON THAT THE TAX BURDEN IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND SO WE THINK ABOUT THAT IN. CONNECTION WITH THE FACT THAT MANY FOLKS MIGHT BE LEAVING THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE. I'M JUST WONDERING IF -- THE TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE PART OF YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS OR THIS STUDY IN AND HOW WE CAN MAYBE BE A LITTLE MORE SYMPATHETIC. TO THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CREATIVE ECONOMY -- YOU KNOW FACES AS IT RELATES TO THE TAX BURDEN COMING FROM CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WOULD WANT THOSE JOBS TO GO AWAY RIGHT -- BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM. TO FEEL. HAVE A PINCH FEEL MORE LIKE. A PUNCH. SO I GUESS I WOULD START BY SAYING THAT WE COMMONLY HERE THAT IN AND IN ADDITION TO BEING A CREATIVE CAPITAL. AND ATTACK. CAPITAL. ALSO AN ENTREPRENEURIAL CAPITAL -- AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS SO WE WE HAVE. LARGE NUMBERS OF SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES INCLUDING THE ARTS -- THE FIRST WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES LEAVING CALIFORNIA IT'S IT DOES HAPPEN YOU KNOW BUT IT'S ALSO WE'VE SEEN A NET. POSITIVE INCREASE IN. IN POPULATION AND SO ON WE HAVE. MADE AN OUTSIDE CONTRIBUTION TO JOB GROWTH RELATIVE TO THE NATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SO. FOR ALL OF THE TAXES% AND REGULATIONS AND SO ON THAT. BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO FACE. THEY HAVE SOMEHOW MANAGED -- TO HELP PERFORM IF YOU WILL AT THE STATE LEVEL -- MANY OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. SO I THOUGHT I'D IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WELL WE WE LIKE TO BEAT OURSELVES UP. FOR BEING A HIGH COST STATE TO DO BUSINESS FOR HAVING HIGH LEVELS OF REGULATION. HI TAXES ALL TRUE SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER BUSINESSES. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND AND AND MANAGED TO SUCCEED IN THE AND THE TRACK RECORD HAS BEEN. QUITE GOOD OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAVING SAID ALL THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THE WHAT I DON'T HAVE FIGURES TO CITE -- BUT WHAT I HAVE ARE ANECDOTAL OBSERVATIONS FROM. TALKING TO BUSINESS PEOPLE AND SO ON AS LONG AS THEY KNOW THE RULES OF THE GAME. AND THE RULES OF THE GAME IN THE FORM OF TAXATION PERMITTING AND SO ON ARE FAIRLY CLEAR -- MANAGEABLE AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN NAVIGATE OR THEY CAN GET ASSISTANCE TO NAVIGATE AT THE AT THE STATE LOCAL LEVEL. THEN THEY'LL DO WHAT THEY DO BEST AND AND IN MANY INSTANCES THEY WILL SUCCEED. YOUR HIGH FAILURE RATES AMONG SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE ONE OUT OF FIVE FAILED THIS IT THIS NUMBER IS IS REMARKABLY STABLE. NATIONALLY AND STATEWIDE NOW ONE OUT OF SORRY ABOUT 50%. OF BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES THAT START UP -- FAIL WITHIN WITHIN FIVE YEARS -- THAT'S PARTLY THE MANIFESTATION OR OR JUST WHAT HAPPENS IN A IN A MARKET ECONOMY SUCH AS OURS. SO -- I CAN APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND YOU KNOW THE CONCERN ABOUT [inaudible] TAX BURDEN -- IN REGULATORY BURDEN WE HAVE NOT HAD OCCASION TO STUDY THAT AS PART OF THIS RESEARCH SO. RIGHT WANT WHEN GIVE -- MR BUT HIGH OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AND THEN AND THEN WILL OPEN UP THE THE PANEL THE QUESTION -- ALMOST AS VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR ENDEAVOR. AND WE WELCOME YOU HERE AND ARE LOOKING FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. A WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME SENATOR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. LINE DANA THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS AND THANKS FOR ALL YOUR LEADERSHIP -- IN PUSHING -- IN FOCUSING ON THE ARTS -- SO I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNOR ELATION TREND EVER LEADING ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY BASED IN BEVERLY HILLS. ENDEAVOR IS FORMALLY W. ANY I. N. G. IT'S A GLOBAL LEADER IN SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT AND FASHION WITH NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES ACROSS MORE THAN TWENTY COUNTRIES. AROUND THE WORLD IS NAMED ONE OF FORTUNE'S TWENTY FIVE MOST IMPORTANT PRIVATE COMPANIES. ENDEAVOR IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF A NUMBER OF SUBSIDIARIES WITH LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES INCLUDING W. M. ME. I AM G.. R. U. F. C. -- FREEZE ART WHICH JUST HELD ITS INAUGURAL LOS ANGELES ART FAIR IN FEBRUARY. PROFESSIONAL BULL RIDERS -- WHICH HAD AN EVENT JUST OUTSIDE SACRAMENTO AT THIS PAST JANUARY AND ONE IN LOS ANGELES IN FEBRUARY I WAS A EUPHEMISM FOR LEGISLATORS AND I MISS UNIVERSE ORGANIZATION. I AM G. ACADEMY AND MANY MORE -- NINETEEN NINETY FIVE R. EMMANUEL IS THE CURRENT CEO OF ENDEAVOR I RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY CONTENT WAS BEING CREATED. DISTRIBUTED CONSUMES WAS QUICKLY CHANGING WITH THAT IN MIND HE FORMED A NEW TOWN AGENCY CALLED ENDEAVOR -- WHICH YOU BECOME W. ME -- WITH THE IDEA OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE CHANGES AND BETTER REPRESENTING -- THE ARTISTS -- THAT -- WERE IN THE EIGHT THAT HE WAS REPRESENTING -- A KEY PART OF AFFECTED TALENT REPRESENTATION IS UNDERSTANDING AN ARTIST PERSPECTIVE IN VISION FOR THEIR CAREER. AND ONE'S GOING TO BE BETTER POSITIONS IN THE ROLE OF AN AGENT IF THEY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN THE ARTS -- IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. EXECUTIVES AGENTS OFTEN BEGIN THEIR CAREERS AS ASSISTANCE -- ANSWERING THE PHONES DELIVERING MAIL FOR AGENTS AND EXECUTIVES THEY ONE DAY INSPIRED TO BE -- THOSE PEOPLE YOU KNOW -- ARE GOING TO BE -- BETTER QUALIFIED TO DO THAT JOB AS AN ASSISTANT ANSWERING THE PHONE IF THEY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN ARTS EDUCATION. YOU KNOW TODAY -- IF THEY NEVER HAD A IN HIGH SCHOOL A JAZZ ENSEMBLE THAT THEY WERE PART OF AND AND LIKE THEIR DAD BANDS PRACTICE THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN AN APPRECIATED. I DEVELOP FILM OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS -- IN A LOT OF WAYS THEY'RE GONNA BE LESS QUALIFIED -- TO BE JUST AN ASSISTANCE AT A TALENT AGENCY THEN SOMEONE WHO HAD THAT TYPE OF ARTS EDUCATION BACKGROUND. BUT THAT GOT DELAYED THERE GONNA BE MORE LIKELY TO COME FROM A LOWER INCOME MINORITY MAJORITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WAITS ARTS EDUCATION ARTS CURRICULA -- I WON THE FIRST THINGS THAT ARE CUT FROM BUDGETS -- SO DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE. IS WHAT DRIVES THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE ITS SILLY INNOVATE. AND THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE THROUGH THE INCLUSION OF UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. INVOICE. RECOGNIZING IT THERE IS A LACK OF ACCESS FOR CERTAIN GROUPS ENDEAVOR HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS BY MAKING ACCESSIBILITY TO QUALITY ARTS EDUCATION A PRIORITY. IN ITS SOCIAL IMPACT IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVES. THE LEGISLATURE'S ALSO WORK TO TOWARDS MAKING HOLLYWOOD MORE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE -- SPECIFICALLY WE HAD THE PLEASURE WORKING WITH MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON -- LIKE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT RENEWAL CITY YOUR QUESTION IS WELL ABOUT AYE INCENTIVIZING I MEAN I DO THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY AND SHORE BASED ON THAT PRESENTATION THE CALIFORNIA REMAINS COMPETITIVE -- AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS YOU KNOW THE RENEWAL THIS CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA CHIU. TANG SENATOR ALLEN -- MITCHELL'S AND STERN AS WELL FOR WORKING ON THE RENEWAL THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTIONTAX CREDIT SPECIFICALLY THE INCLUSION OF A DIVERSE CITY PROMOTE -- TRACKING INITIATIVE COMPONENT TO IT WHICH WITH THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW CREATE DATA THAT WILL BE ABLE TO ASSESS YOU KNOW WHETHER IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS BECOMING MORE. DIVERSE -- INCLUSIVE MOVING FORWARD -- IN WHETHER THE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES AND TV YEAR. MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF THIS STATE -- SAID THANKS FOR ALL YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS FOR THIS NEXT CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT. ONE OF THE REASONS ENDEAVOR SUPPORTED THE OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN REPORT ON THE CREATIVE ECONOMY IS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT ARTS EDUCATION IS THAT CREAM IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. IF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO ARTS EDUCATION TO STUDENTS IN OUR OWN BACKYARD SPECIFICALLY LOWER INCOME MINORITY STUDENTS. WHAT WILL THE FUTURE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY LOOK LIKE? WE SHOULD BE EMPOWERING THESE VOICES OF THEY CAN CREATE THE NEXT HIT SHOW OR BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE SO THAT THEY CAN SELL THEIR SCULPTURES IT FREES. SO THAT THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE THEIR VOICES THE NATIONAL THE BATES. USING ANY OF THESE ARTISTIC VEHICLES AND EVEN IF THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WHEN THEY'RE OLDER. HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARTS IN APPRECIATION FOR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ONLY MAKES ONE MORE VALUABLE AT WHATEVER HE OR SHE DECIDES TO DO. YEAH THIS REPORT PROVIDES KEY DATA THAT IS FEEL SPECIFIC DIVERSITY INCLUSIVITY INITIATIVES BY ENDEAVOR ONE CONCLUSION THAT WE GOT FROM THE STUDY THAT THE LACK OF EQUITY AND ACCESS STARTS EDUCATION NOT ONLY DENIES CHILDREN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE A WELL ROUNDED EDUCATION. IT ALSO BLOCKS PATHWAYS INTO A MAJOR REGIONAL ECONOMIC ENGINE. AND IT. DEPRIVES THAT ENGINE OF THE FUEL IT NEEDS TO THRIVE. ENDEAVOR IS TAKEN ON SEVERAL PROJECTS IMPACTING A NUMBER OF ISSUES BROUGHT UP IN THE REPORT LAST ELECTION WE PARTNERED WITH ARTS FOR LA AND THE CULVER CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO INCREASE IN SAFEGUARDS TO THE ACCESS STARTS EDUCATION IN CULVER CITY SCHOOLS BE A PARTIAL TAX BALLOT INITIATIVE. THE PARTIAL TAX PASSED WITH OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTE. UNDER PROP THIRTEEN VOTER APPROVED PARCEL TAXES CAN BE PROPOSED FOR ANY CALIFORNIA DISTRICT NEED. AND ARE ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING TOOLS FOR GENERATING FUNDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN CULVER CITY THE PARTIAL TAXES A FLAT HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE DOLLAR PER PARCEL. THIS RESULTS IN TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR SEVEN YEARS WHICH INCLUDES ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR ARTS EDUCATION. INITIATIVESLIKE THIS OR A SMALL STEP TOWARDS THE SYSTEMIC CHANGE THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. THIS REPORT ALSO PROVIDES DATA THAT IS INFLUENCED ENDEAVOR AND W. MUSE DECISION TO FINE ARTS EDUCATION PROGRAMMING IN THE CONTENT SCHOOL DISTRICT. CONNECT THE MIGHT MENTORSHIP PROGRAM WHERE FORTY YOUNG PEOPLE FROM COMPTON COME TO DEBBIE ME OFFICE IS IN BEVERLY HILLS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR -- WE JUST RECENTLY LAUNCHED A YOUNG EXECUTIVES FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM WITH THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER YOUNG EXECUTIVES FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM AIMS TO CREATE A PIPELINE FOR FUTURE LEADERS IN FILM AND TELEVISION EACH YEAR TWENTY HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS WILL BE CHOSEN ON A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BASIS. FOR A TWO YEAR PROGRAM THEY'LL INCLUDE CURRICULUM COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS IN MENTORING. ALL WILL BE SELECTED FROM UNDERSERVED SCHOOLS IN LA CONTENT IN INGLEWOOD WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL EACH OF THE YOUNG EXECS WILL RECEIVE A PAID SUMMER INTERNSHIP AT ONE OF THE PARTNER COMPANIES INCLUDING W. I. ME. WITH A VIEW TO LAUNCHING THEIR CAREERS W. ME HAS PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SEED FUNDING FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP FUND -- WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH MAYOR GARCETTI'S OFFICE WITH THE INVOLVED ENTERTAINMENT FUND A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AIMED AT CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY -- THIS REPORT PROVIDES THE DATA THAT PROVES THE SUPPORTING AND PROMOTING THE ARTS IS ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. THIS REPORT OUTLINES ALL THE WAYS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS IN ITS GOVERNMENT BENEFIT FROM THE ARTS IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. WE ARE PROUD HAVE SUPPORTED AND GRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE AT OTIS FOR PUTTING IT TOGETHER. WE HOPE TO SEE CONTINUED EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE TO PROMOTE THE ARTS BY PASSING -- WHICH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU YOU KNOW IS PUT AT SOME LEGISLATION ABOUT UPDATED DATA COLLECTION LEGISLATION THAT WILL ENABLE US TO FURTHER STUDY THE IMPACT OF ARTS EDUCATION -- TO THE CREATION OF A CALIFORNIA EVENTS FUNDS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN. TEXAS AND LOUISIANA -- I KNOW THIS IS ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED AS WELL -- TALKS ABOUT THIS IN THE SENATE AS WELL -- THAT WILL HELP BRING LIVE IN CREATIVE ADVANCE TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND HELP INCENTIVIZE AND PROVIDE A A REASON FOR THEM. TO COME HERE AND PUT ON THESE EVENTS AND INSPIRE AND CREATE -- ECONOMIC IMPACT -- THE EVENTS ON WHICH OUR CULTURE INSPIRE KIDS CREATE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR THE ECONOMY -- THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND ALL YOUR WORK. IN PROMOTING IT AND THANKS FOR HAVING THANK YOU FOR YOUR MOST PROJECT THAT. WELL GOOD VERY INTERESTING PRESENTATIONS ALL WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM THE FROM THE PANEL YES SAID AS OVER TO YOU WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF LET ME FIRST THANK -- THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEES -- AS WELL AS EVERYONE PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S PANEL -- I HAD ASKED TO JOIN THIS COMMITTEE COUPLE YEARS AGO BECAUSE MY CITY SAN FRANCISCO REFLECTS ONE OF THOSE CENTERS. OF THE CREDIT A CONNIE AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY I DO THINK IS INTEGRAL TO OUR SUCCESS NOT JUST ECONOMICALLY AS A STATE BUT WHO WE ARE AS CALIFORNIANS THE SPIRIT OF OUR STATE AND WHAT WE PROJECT OUT TO THE TO THE WORLD. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT JUST THANK AMOS AND ENDEAVOR FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DID LAST YEAR. ON THE HOLLYWOOD FILM TAX CREDIT AND REALLY THINKING ABOUT DIVERSITY ISSUES WITHIN THE HOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY IN AND SAY THAT. WHEN? THE PUBLIC THINKS ABOUT THE CREATIVE ECONOMY THERE OFTEN THINKING ABOUT TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT TEND TO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE ETHNIC RACIAL AND ECONOMIC DIVERSITY THE STATE SO. YOU THINK ABOUT THE SYMPHONY IN THE UPPER THE BALLET YOU THINK ABOUT HOLLYWOOD YOU THINK ABOUT -- THE MUSIC SCENE -- THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS AN ECONOMY THAT LIFTS UP ALL BOATS AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT TODAY. THIS HEARING IS FOCUSING ON THE EDUCATION PIPELINE AND ALSO ON HOW WE LIFT UP YOUTH -- I DO HOPE THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION SPECIFICALLY RUN THE WORKFORCE AT SOME POINT. ABOUT HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY HIGHER. THE DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- PROMOTE DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND HAVE IN ITS LEADERSHIP THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK MY MY QUESTION REALLY IS IF THERE ARE ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING IN THAT AREA TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY ENGAGING IN. ALL ASPECTS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY AND WHAT IS I THINK ONE OF OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF A STATE WHICH IS OUR CREATE A CALMING. OUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRIORITIES FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL IS THAT CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE. ARE REACHING OUT TO ALL THE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MAYBE NOT EVEN [inaudible] YOU KNOW. THERE ARE ENTERING THE WORK FORCE AND THEN NOT EVEN GETTING UP INTO LEADERSHIP POSITIONS THROUGH SOME SPECIAL INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE. AND THEN IN OUR GRANTS PORTFOLIO OVER ALL. WE WE TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF CARE AND IT'S A CONSTANT ITERATIVE. PROCESS FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WE'RE HELPING TO UP LEFT AND IN RICH ALL THE COMMUNITY SO FOLKS CAN SEE THEMSELVES. ANYBODY CAN SEE THEMSELVES IN A JOB. THAT IS [inaudible] MAYBE NORMALLY VIEWED AS PART OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY OR NOT NORMALLY VIEWED AS PART OF THE GREAT CREATIVE ECONOMY BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THOSE. FOLKS IT REALLY THINKS IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO JUST SAY THIS IS CREATIVE ECONOMY WHEN I KNOW FULL WELL. WHEN I'M TALKING TO BOEING? THEY VALUE THEIR CREE HERE IF THERE IS. AS WE ALL DO WHEN WE GET ON THAT PLANE. YEAH. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO WELL. AND ALL THE SYSTEMS INTERLINK WELL AND THAT'S DESIGN AND AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE A AND STATE. THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES TO MAKE SURE WE REACH OUT TO ALL POPULATION. IF YOU DON'T MIND -- ME ADDING TO THAT THE ONE THING WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IN THIS STUDY. BUT I THINK THE CONNECTION IS FAIRLY CLOSE IS THAT WHEN. YOU LOOK AT A CITY LIKE SAN FRANCISCO WHERE TOURISM IS SO IMPORTANT. PEOPLE COME FOR A VISIT SAN FRANCISCO. TO YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE -- TO GO TO THE MUSEUMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THEY ALSO STOP. AT RESTAURANTS AND THEY STAY IN A HOTEL SO TOUR SO THE ARTS. REALLY IS A CATALYST IN SOME SENSE THAT -- THAT BRINGS TOURISM TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IT AND THE BUSINESSES THAT. SERVE THOSE TOURISTS ARE BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. AND VERY ETHNICALLY DIVERSE. BECAUSE PEOPLE COME TO CALIFORNIA OR GO TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA TO EXPERIENCE. THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND AND ALL THAT SO WHEN WE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AS AN ECONOMIC ENGINE -- IT'S IT'S GOOD IDEA TO THANK YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN POINT OUT WITH YOUR COMMENT ABOUT -- CREATORS IN BOEING BOEING IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED TOURISM WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES. THROUGH FRIDAY REVENUE STREAMS THAT -- REALLY RELIES HEAVILY ON ARTS AND CULTURE -- AS A MAGNET TO DRAW THOSE TOURISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. I THINK ONE THING I'LL JUST OBSERVE -- IS THE ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT CREATIVE ECONOMY WORLD IS NOT ONE THAT I THINK. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HOLLYWOOD -- HAS HAD AS MUCH OF A ROLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN TRYING TO WIN FOR POLICIES PRACTICALLY AND HOW WE'RE TRYING TO INFLUENCE EDUCATION WORKFORCE AS AS I WITH. ONE AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY TO THE PANELISTS AND AND OTHERS IN THE PUBLIC -- AS A MEMBER THIS COMMITTEE I'M CERTAINLY LOOKING FOR INTERESTING IDEAS AND WHAT WE CAN DO. TO SUPPORT THIS ECONOMY AND ENSURE THAT IT IS REALLY LIFTING UP EVERYONE -- BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE -- IT IS A COMPETITIVE STRENGTH THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR OUR ECONOMY FOR STATE -- AND AND AND THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE THERE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. YEAH NUMBER. THREE THANK YOU A SENATOR AND THEN ON THE PRESENTERS TODAY -- I AM -- WELL -- BEING -- ORIENTATED AND EDUCATED UP BY YOUR PRESENTATION -- I OR DIDN'T COME FROM KOREA AND YES SIXTY EIGHT THAT DISTRIBUTES ORANGE COUNTY. AND I'M VERY INTRIGUED ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY. CREATIVE -- ECONOMY -- BOB -- THREE FOUR FIVE SOMETHING YEARS AGO -- PRESIDENT FORM OF PRESIDENT OF KOREA -- THE LADY -- COULDN'T HAVE HOT. SHE CAME UP A WITH THE CREATIVELY KANA ME. AND IT WAS A VERY OF BUZZ WORD THAT TO ME AND WHAT EXACTLY SHE WAS OF PURSUING BY THAT THE TERMINOLOGY. YEAH CHIANG JOEL CHUNG J. IN KOREA AND AND THAT THAT'S EXACTLY TO THE TRANSLATION OF CLUB CREATIVE ECONOMY. BUT THE TODAVÃ­A I SEE IT THAT IS -- MORE OF I DEFINED IN THE POTS AND CULTURE AND AND TO TAME A AND THE IN THE MOVIES -- FINE NOT SO. EVEN PERFORMING ARTS -- IN IN THAT THE CATEGORY. AND THEN I DO SEE THAT -- A LOT OF A THE UPON OUR ECONOMY FROM THAT THE INDUSTRY IS SO -- ADDING ON TO OUR STATE OF HOW CALIFORNIA -- AND IN THAT -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOR THE PEOPLE OR IN THAT THE CREATIVE -- AREA. AND THE WHICH I'M NOT IN THERE. MY MAJOR WAS -- LIBRARY INFORMATION SCIENCE. AND I'M JUST -- I'M WHEN I ADD THAT TO POINTS -- IN MY COMMENT THEM. THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED SEVERAL OF YOU MENTIONED THAT THE MUSEUM IN THERE -- AS A PART OF CREATIVE ECONOMY -- INDUSTRY. AND WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO -- WAS -- TO OF BEER IS THE ORANGE COUNTY SO -- THE MAIN LIBRARY -- TO KEEP UP WITH THE SQUARE FOOTAGE PER CAPITA IT CAME UP TO BE OVER -- TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT. LIBRARY ISN'T NEEDED AN ORANGE COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY'S A PERCEIVED AS SOME WHICH COUNTY HOWEVER STRANGELY. I WOULDN'T HAVE -- CENTRAL LIBRARY WEARS A OF EVEN POOR COUNTY IS SAID TO HAVE THAT THEN DONE IVORY IT IS -- BUT LIKE A CULTURE CENTER OF THE COMMUNITY. AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE EDUCATION. THAT'S THE PLACE SO WE ARE MUSEUM IS SO TO ME MORE PASS IT TO THEM IN A IN A PASSIVE AREA YOU WILL DO. LOOK AT THINGS ABOUT THE LIBRARY SO MORE ACTIVE PLACE SO YOU CAN CREATE THE ZONING -- HOW MANY TIMES SO SCHOOLS SO WOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME? TO TO TEACH IN OUR IN THIS INDUSTRY SO UNLESS OF A CALL -- TO LE COTTAGES UPPER ORTIZ COLLEGES THAT TRUCK WHAT THE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO EDUCATE THE THE ROD JOB SO IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY. SO THOSE ARE LIKE -- IN MY VISION. IN THE SPACE OF THAT ALLOW LARGE LIBRARY SPEAKS UP. WE CAN CREATE THE LIKE THE ROOMS OF FOR MEDIA CREATION EDITING ALL THE FUN HOBBY THING SO CAN AND COURAGE. AND ON WE HAVE A LAND THAT THAT WE PARK IT AND ALL. A CITY OF IRVINE WE HAVE BUILT OVER THREE HUNDRED STYLES THREE HUNDRED THE MILLION DOLLARS OF FUND -- WE WE HAD EVERYTHING BUT DOORS AND ALL -- WILL OF THE COUNCIL WHEN I PROPOSED. SO I COULD NOT CLOSE IT BEFORE I LEFT THE CITY SO MAYOR. BECAUSE I CAME UP HERE AND THE STEELERS SPENDING I'M I'M TRYING TO PUSH IT. SO I HOPE WHAT I CAN FIND SOME WAYS -- IN ALL SUPPORT DOT THAT THE LIBRARY IT SHOULD BE PART OF THAT EDUCATION NAME TO CREATE A POP. ART SO THAT TO YOUR PROMOTING. DOES THE ONE AREA AND THAT THE OTHER ONE IS THAT BUT AS I SUFFER MEMBERS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THAT -- I SEE -- CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY SEVEN CALIFORNIA HOLLYWOOD DATE IS THE LASTING TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE FOR THEM TO COME BACK. I THINK THAT THIS BODY ON THIS TODAY CHAU WOULD HAVE -- TO I AM. A MEMBER OF A THE WITH THE US THEM AND LOOK AT CHIU THE PAYMENT AND UP [inaudible] PARTS. SO I AM STARTING TO PAY. ATTENTION TO THAT AREA HOW WE CAN RETAIN AND TO BRING BACK -- SUCH INDUSTRY SO TO CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE EXAMPLES WAS THAT -- NOT NECESSARILY. THE INDUSTRY -- OF CREATIVE -- ECONOMY AND ALL A MOVIE MAKERS UP BUT THAT IN GENERAL -- ANY -- BUSINESSES SO WHICH HAVE LEFT OUR STATE. IF YOU COME BACK A WILL GIVE YOU A SIXTEEN POINT 5% OF A TAX CREDIT UP COME BACK OR IF YOU ARE HERE CREATE THE MORE JOBS TO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A TAX CREDIT. FOR THE SIXTEEN POINT 5%. TAX INCENTIVE WAS USED IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. FOR ALSO TRYING TO LEAVE. THE STATE CAME UP WITH THAT NUMBER SO THAT NUMBER WAS ALREADY FOR MEDIA ONE BUT SOMEHOW FOR TWO YEARS -- IT JUST TOOK OUT THE HUNG UP BUT AND DOES -- APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND THAT DID NOT PASS -- SO I AM TRYING -- TO CREATE -- A MECHANISM SO THAT OUR INDUSTRY OUR CREATIVE INDUSTRIAL WHAT ANY BUSINESS SO -- WOULD IT WILL NOT BE FORCED OUT OF OUR STATE. AND TO COME BACK. TWO HOURS SO SO I THINK OF THIS BODY NEED TO REALLY WORK CAR. THAT THE THIS -- OF CREATIVE -- ECONOMY INDUSTRY -- WALL NO MATTER WHAT FIELD IT MAY BE -- A WE NEED TO NURTURE BUSINESSES SO THAT THAT THEY CAN THRIVE AND ED -- THE REVENUE TWELVE A STEP UP BECAUSE OF THOSE ARE THE MOST A JOB CREATORS SO IF WE HAVE A JOB CREATORS TO AND AND MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A VERY ENOUGH INCOME NOT BECOME. HOMELESS PEOPLE YOU KNOW -- WE CAN THEY CAN AFFORD. THE THE HOME SO THAT EXPENSIVE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. IN A WIN -- INDUSTRIES SO THAT'S JOB CREATING INDUSTRIES A HIGH PAYING INDUSTRIES AND LEAVE THE STATE. AND THE WE BECOMES WELFARE STATE. AND ALL OR ONE SKILLED DOT HOME NASA. OF PEOPLE COME IN AND THE WEALTHIEST STATE THAT DOWN NOW WHAT THE STATE BECAUSE OF ALMOST STATE. AND WE SHOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO STAY HERE AND ABOUT TRACK THAT YES MY COM.

FROM A FARM DAY OUR SCHOOL REGARDING TO EDUCATION AND THAT WE KNOW -- WHERE ARE GOOD STRONG? JOINT ARE AND WHERE IS HE DID THE WORK POINTS ARE GOOD I KNOW SOME OF THE WHICH WILL DOES COLLECTING INFORMATION BUT NOW ALL OF THE SCHOOL INFORMATION. I'M. REALLY LOOKING -- FOR TO HERE FOR AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME OF THE STRONG DATA TO BACK UP MY ONE FIVE BILL WHICH I PROBABLY I WILL BE INTRODUCING AGAIN NEXT YEAR. AND YOU KNOW I'M AN ENGINEER BY TRAINING A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE STEM EDUCATION. BUT IS PRECISELY WHAT I SUPPORT -- EDUCATION. THE GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH SHOW THAT ARTS LEAD TO BETTER -- STAM. EDUCATION ALL CALM. AND AT ARTS EDUCATION PROMOTE -- CURIOSITY CREATIVITY AND ENGAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT. SO WHY THIS IS WHERE YOU AT ARCH TO SPAM YOU GASOLINE. AND I'M DEFINITELY A VERY -- STRONG ADVOCATE -- FOR STEAM EDUCATION TO EDUCATE. THE NEXT GENERATION OF OUR KIDS. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PANEL WE HAVE -- DEVALUATION ALL ART EDUCATION PIPELINE. ALL RIGHT. SO. WE HAVE THE JACK MITCHELL. OF BE BOP HA AND ART MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSULTANT. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND WE DO HAVE -- DENISE GRANDY THE DIRECTOR OF ARTS EDUCATION LOS ANGELES COUNTY ARCH AT COLLECTIVE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY ARTS COMMISSION. AND THE THIRD. ONE IS. TO THE HIS SHOES. ALL THE WHOLE GM. THE CHAIR OF CREATIVE. CREATE CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT -- THEM MORE MORE MORE MORENO VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION WELCOME GOOD MORNING. I WOULD LIKE TO BE BEGIN BY THANKING SENATOR ALLEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THE ARTS IN CALIFORNIA AND ARTS EDUCATION -- MORE SPECIFICALLY MY NAME IS JACK MITCHELL -- A. M. THE ARCH MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT CONSULTANT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS PRIOR TO THAT I WAS A THEATER AND STAGE CRAFT TEACHER AND LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. AND PRIOR TO THAT I WAS A STATISTIC IN THE ORDERS REPORT WHEN I WAS AN ACTOR IN FILM AND TELEVISION IN LOS ANGELES. FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS -- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INVITING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION TODAY -- IT'S OUR ROLE TO SUPPORT CREATIVITY CATION FOR CALIFORNIA IN ALL CALIFORNIA CLASSROOMS FOR OUR SIX MILLION. STUDENTS -- MY ROLE HERE IS TO GIVE YOU SORT OF A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW OF EDUCATION AND THEN WE WILL LOOKS BRING THE PLANE IN FOR A LANDING AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE OTHER PANELISTS -- AND LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT WHEN I CAME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THERE WAS A ART MUSIC BLOCK GRANT THAT FUNDED. TO GO PROVIDE CATEGORICAL FUNDING -- FOR ARTS EDUCATION -- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN L. C. F. F. CAME ABOUT -- THOSE FUNDS WERE ROLLED INTO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING AND THE FOCUS OF OF ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT AND PLANNING FOR ARTS EDUCATION SHIFTED FROM THE STATE LEVEL. TO THE LOCAL LEVEL -- THE PROBABLY THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT'S HAPPENED AND MOST ENCOURAGING THING THAT'S HAPPENED IN MY TWELVE YEARS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ED. IS -- HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY WHEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION -- ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR ARTS EDUCATION AND SORT OF ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU HEARD FOR THE FOLKS REMOTEST TALKING ABOUT THE INCREASE IN MEDIA EDUCATION AND MEDIA ARTS IN CALIFORNIA. WE INCLUDED MEDIA ARTS STANDARDS FOR MEDIA ARTS. EDUCATION AS WELL AND THOSE STANDARDS ARE FOR MEDIA ARTS EDUCATION FROM K. THROUGH TWELVE NOT JUST FOR THOSE FOLKS IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT KIDS NEED TO BEGIN LEARNING ABOUT MEDIA ARTS EDUCATION. IN THE EARLY GRADES -- THIS IS WHEN IN FACT STUDENTS ARE MOST CREATIVE -- AND THE EXPERTS THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS THEM SET TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES FOR MEDIA ARTS IS A VERY IMPORTANT. I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT THE EDUCATION PIPELINE AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THE ROLE THAT I HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS AS THE INDUSTRY SECTOR LEAD. FOR ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT WHICH IS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN THE ARTS -- MOST OF YOUR FAMILIAR WITH CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE STATE PLAN FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION -- MOVED FROM SIX GENERAL CAREER AREAS TO FIFTEEN INDUSTRY SECTORS. AND AT THAT POINT THE STATE PLAN WRITERS REALIZED THAT THERE WAS. A EXISTING INDUSTRY IN A RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRY IN ARTS MEDIAAND ENTERTAINMENT AND THAT IT SHOULD IN FACT BE ONE OF THE INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT WE BEGAN TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THROUGH THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE FIRST BEGAN COLLECTING DATA ON ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. THERE WERE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A ME PROGRAMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE. THOSE STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN FOUR MAIN PATHWAYS. DESIGN VISUAL AND MEDIA ARTS. PERFORMING ARTS PRODUCTION AND MANAGERIAL ARTS AND GAME DESIGN. THERE WAS NO WIDESPREAD -- SUPPORT FOR ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT AS AN INDUSTRY SECTOR. AND THERE WAS NO DATA BEING PUBLICLY GATHERED I KNOW THAT DATA WAS BEING GATHERED BUT THERE WAS NO MESS THAT OF DISSEMINATING THAT DATA ON JOBS. IN ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. WHEN I CAME UP THROUGH SCHOOL -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REMEMBER AND MAYBE SOME OF YOU REMEMBER TO IS THAT IF YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THE ARTS AS I WAS YOU WERE. TOLD HIM THAT YOU NEED A BACK UP PLAN. WELL I THINK THAT LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION IN THE ORDERS REPORT ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S CLEAR NOW IS THAT THE ARTS CAN BE YOUR BACKUP PLAN. THERE ARE JOBS IN THE ARTS IN AND WE PREPARE THOSE STUDENTS IN ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMS. THE ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY SECTOR HAS GROWN FROM THOSE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN MAKING ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT THE LARGEST INDUSTRY SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. TWICE THE SIZE OF AGRICULTURE EDUCATION AND TWICE THE SIZE OF HEALTH CAREERS EDUCATION ACTUALLY AMY IS LARGER THAN BOTH AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH CAREERS EDUCATION. COMBINED WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED -- I PROVIDED YOU -- ACTUALLY LAUREN I BELIEVE WILL SHARE WITH YOU SOME INFORMATION REGARDING STUDENT ENROLLMENT DATA -- AND WE WERE WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DATE A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT SOME STUDENT ROMAN DATA BOTH IN THE ARTS AND IN THE ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY SECTORS. SO IN ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE INFO ENROLLED IN THE DESIGN VISUAL AND MEDIA ARTS PATHWAY. AND THAT PATHWAY INCLUDES FOLKS LIKE PRODUCTION -- DESIGNERS -- DIRECTORS -- ARTISTS -- MEDIA ARTISTS ANIMATORS -- THERE ARE. TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED IN PERFORMING ARTS PROGRAMS AND DANCE THEATER MUSIC -- THERE FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN PRODUCTION MANAGERIAL ARTS AND THOSE ARE BASICALLY THE BELOW THE LINE JOBS IN FILM AND TELEVISION THE FOLKS WHO WORK BEHIND THE CAMERA BEHIND THE SCENES. AND THEN FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS IN OUR NEWEST INDUSTRY SECTOR OF GAME DESIGN [inaudible] SO THE IN THE PAST -- TWELVE YEARS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH IN ART IN ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT AND THAT GROWTH. IS WHILE I WON'T SAY IT'S BECAUSE BY IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN GREATLY SUPPORTED BY THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE OLDEST REPORT. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN I FIRST SAW THE OWNERS REPORT THERE WAS NO PUBLIC DATA THAT WE COULD POINT TO TO SHOW THAT THERE WERE IN FACT JOBS HERE. BUT THAT OTIS REPORT PROVIDED US WITH -- WITH THE ABILITY TO SHARE WITH FOLKS THE IMPACT OF THE OF THE ARTS ON THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. THE NUMBER OF JOBS AVAILABLE IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND THAT CERTAINLY HELPED ME OUT WHEN I TALK TO SCHOOL COUNSELORS ABOUT. IT URGING STUDENTS TO GO INTO THE ARTS RATHER THAN SUPPORTING THEM INTO THE ARTS BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE FOR THEM -- AND IT ALSO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF CREATIVE IN THE CALIFORNIA WORK FORCE BECAUSE THAT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THROUGH LOOKING AT THE REPORT. SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT IS NOW THE LARGEST INDUSTRY SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA EDUCATION -- THERE ARE THIRTEEN SUB PATHWAYS WITHIN OUR FOR MAJOR PATHWAYS THAT I DISCUSSED THAT PEPARE STUDENTS. TO TO FOR CAREERS IN MEDIA ARTS IN ANIMATION IN GRAPHIC DESIGN IN PROFESSIONAL FILL PROFESSIONAL FILM IN DANCE -- THEATER AND MUSIC -- TO SUPPORT THE ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION WE HAVE ELEVEN MODEL DEMONSTRATION SITE PROGRAMS AS WE GREW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED WAS -- HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE SURE THAT THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAMS IS HIGH QUALITY -- WE HAVE A LOT OF KIDS INTEREST IN ROLLING IN PROGRAMS AND A LOT OF TEACHERS INTERESTED IN THE AREAS BUT HOW COULD WE ASSURE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS. SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT A MODEL -- USED BY SPECIALIZED SECONDARY PROGRAMS OF CREATING A REGIONAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT MODELS AND SO WE HAVE A LEVEL OF THOSE AROUND THE STATE ONE IN EACH SUPERINTENDENTS REGION. AND THESE ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE HIGH QUALITY CAREER TECH ED PROGRAMS IN ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. AND THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SHARE THEIR THEIR CURRICULUM THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WITH OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE REGION SO THEY PROVIDE REGIONAL SUPPORT FOR A A ME PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE. THIS PAST YEAR WE LAUNCHED. FOR PILOT -- PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN ARTS ME IN FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION. THIS WAS SORT OF GREW OUT OF OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION AND THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU GUYS HAVE TALKED ABOUT ABOUT BRINGING -- FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION BACK INTO THE STATE AND ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THAT IS. IS THOSE -- PRODUCTION COMPANIES NEED TO BE PART OF A CAREER READY IN THIS PROGRAM. AND SO AS PART OF THE CAREER READING THIS PROGRAM WE PARTNER WITH THE FILM COMMISSION ON IDENTIFYING HOW CAN THOSE PRODUCTION PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES. BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF THE FOLKS IN IN FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION THEY DON'T TALK TO EDUCATORS AND THE FOLKS WHO WERE IN EDUCATION VERY OFTEN. DON'T HAVE REGULAR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FOLKS ARE IN FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION. AND SO THAT -- CAREER READING THIS PIECE IS A WAY TO GET THAT CONVERSATION STARTED SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS THAT WE GRADUATE ARE READY FOR THE CREATIVE WORK FORCE -- SO WHAT ARE FUTURE KEYS TO GROWTH IN ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT HOW CAN WE GROW CONTINUE TO GROW THESE PROGRAMS AND BILL THIS PIPELINE AND ALSO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO PREPARE STUDENTS. THE FIRST I THINK IT'S CONTINUE. TO CONTINUATION EXPANSION OF REPORTS LIKE THE OLDEST REPORT THAT PROVIDE US WITH THE DATA WE NEED TO ACTUALLY ARGUE FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE THE CASE WITH LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF. AND ALSO WITH LOCAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND AND SITE LEVEL PRINCIPLES THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE IMPORTANT FOR KIDS THAT THERE. ARE PLACES FOR THESE KIDS TO GO AND WORK -- THE SECOND IS INCREASE INDUSTRY AND LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T DO AS WELL AS SAY AGRICULTURE EDUCATION. IS INDUSTRY ADVOCACY FOR ARTS EDUCATION -- IF A COUPLE OF I GUESS IT WAS LAST YEAR THE THE AGRICULTURE EDUCATION PROGRAM HAS SEVEN CONSULTANT SEVEN FOLKS LIKE MYSELF. AND THEY WERE FACED WITH ELIMINATING ONE OF THOSE SEVEN CONSULTANT POSITIONS. AND THE AG ADVOCACY BOARD WENT TO THE GOVERNOR. AND HE SAID WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET THESE EGG PEOPLE OFF MY BACK. AND IN FACT THEY KEPT THAT SEVENTH POSITION SO THEY HAVE SEVEN FOLKS SUPPORTING THEIR HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS WHILE WE HAVE ONE FOR OUR TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS -- SHOW CONTINUED SUPPORT -- A CREATIVE EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT. THE ARTS AT THE AG EDUCATION HAS AN INCENTIVE GRANT A LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET OF I THINK AROUND FOUR POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE EDUCATION OR AROUND THE STATE. BUT THERE'S NO SUCH INCENTIVE GRANT FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION. THAT WOULD SERVE STUDENTS IN GRADES K. THROUGH. TWELVE AND THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE. AND THEN START UP FUNDING FOR A ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT TEACHER ORGANIZATION. THIS -- ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY SECTOR INVOLVES TEACHERS WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY VISUAL PERFORMING ARTS TEACHERS IN IN OUR TO IN THEATER AND BRINGING THOSE FOLKS TOGETHER IN AN ORGANIZED FASHION. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A SINGLE VOICE IN ADVOCACY FOR PIPELINE. TO CAREERS IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT -- ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECES IS THE ONE THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MENTION AND THAT IS DATA I KNOW THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATIONAL DATA. BUT HAVING AN EDUCATIONAL DATA SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY GAPS. IN NOT ONLY SECONDARY EDUCATION BUT ALSO IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF PROVIDING ARTS EDUCATION FOR ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND THEN -- A CONTINUED FOCUS THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND YOU HAVE SEEN A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT IS. GENERALLY A RESULT OF THAT SUPPORT AND SO THAT CONTINUING THAT SUPPORT IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF MAINTAINING THE PIPELINE FROM THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT TO THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. TO THE INDUSTRY JOBS THEMSELVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH ROOM WAS VERY. ENCOURAGING TO KNOW THAT WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF ARTS WITH HIM THE EMPHASIS ON ARTS IN THE CITY. I MEAN THAT'S THROUGH THE AREA I THANK -- OF WE THE CALIFORNIA THE GENERAL NEED TO REVIEW -- EMPATHIZE SO IT WILL BE ON TO THE NEXT PANELIST. WE HAVE TV. THE MORNING MORNING. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CURIOSITY AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS. ARENA. I'M I WANT TO START TODAY BY. OFFERING A PERSONAL AND HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON ARTS EDUCATION -- I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN STILL LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OF LA COUNTY -- ELLIE CITY KNOWN AS SAN PEDRO. AND AT LAST YEAR MY DAUGHTER GRADUATED FROM THE SAME MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT I ATTENDED AND THAT MY FATHER ATTENDED -- MY FATHER GRADUATED FROM THERE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. I WAS THERE -- WHEN PROP THIRTEEN PASSED AND SIGNED FRONT OF ME ONE YEAR THE ARTS IN SCHOOL AND THE NEXT YEAR THEM GONE? AND I'VE NAVIGATED MY TWO DAUGHTERS THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE THE ARTS IN THEIR SCHOOLS. BECAUSE THIS BEING MY FIELD I KNOW THE IMPACT OF THE ARTS ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT ON COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON AN EMOTIONAL WELL BEING. SO I'M MAKING SURE THAT MY STUDENT MY CHILDREN HAVE ARTS INSTRUCTION AS PART OF THEIR PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT LOW -- INCOME PARENTS OR IMMIGRANT PARENTS CARE LESS OR WANT LESS FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN. BUT I AND I BELIEVE THAT A WELL ROUNDED EDUCATION. THAT INCLUDES THE ARTS BY DEFINITION -- SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT -- TO CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE THE TIME OR THE RESOURCES TO NAVIGATE THEM THROUGH A SYSTEM. I'M OR JUST. TO HAVE THE LUCK OF LANDING IN A SCHOOL WHERE MAYBE A PRINCIPLE OR SPECIFIC TEACHER VALUES THE ARTS. OF FORTY YEARS OUT FROM PROPOSITION THIRTEEN I WILL SAY THAT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE OUT THE ARTS ARE NOT VALUED AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. I AM AND NOW IN A PLACE WHERE I'M. THINKING THAT AFTER THE FORTY YEARS WE'VE LOST THE INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY FOR HOW TO PUT THE ARTS BACK INTO PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND MAYBE ALONG THE WAY WE'VE LOST SOME PUBLIC WELL. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ARTS EDUCATION AT THE LA COUNTY ARTS COMMISSION WHERE I OVERSEE SOMETHING CALLED THE LA COUNTY ARTS EDUCATION COLLECTIVE. IT WAS SOMETHING STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO BY COUNTY GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ARTS EDUCATION FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT. FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND SO BECAUSE LA COUNTY EDUCATES 25% OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EDUCATION STUDENTS. THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS WORK BEING DONE TO SUPPORT THE EIGHTY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. WE STARTED THIS EFFORT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TODAY SEVENTY OF THAT EIGHTY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN LA COUNTY. PLUS FIVE CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORKS HAVE. DEVELOPED AND ADOPTED OR IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING. A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR PUTTING THE ARTS BACK INTO THEIR SCHOOLS. WE NEVER IMAGINED THAT IT THAT WOULD WE WOULD GET TO THAT LEVEL OF SCALE IN. TWO THOUSAND THREE BUT WE'RE ON PACE TO BE WORKING WITH ALL EIGHTY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY. TWENTY TWENTY WHICH GIVES US A MOMENT OF UP TO A MOMENT. TO CHECK OFF THAT FIRST BENCHMARK AND TO RE. REDEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY SCALE AND I WOULD ARGUE BY EQUITY. M. P TO THIS POINT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A BELIEF THAT WE NEVER REALLY GET TO SCALE AGAIN. AND SO SCALE WAS WELL MAYBE SOME DAY. EVERY CHILD EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL BE WORKING TOWARDS PUTTING ARTS BACK IN THEIR SCHOOLS. AND WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER RESOURCE LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THEY REALLY ARE GETTING IT. WELL IF WE CHANGE OUR DEFINITION TO SCALE. TO EVERY CHILD ALL YEAR EVERY YEAR. THE NET ALSO SHIFTS OUR DEFINITION OF EQUITY WHICH IS TO AND THOSE FROM HISTORICALLY UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES GET MORE. SO SCALE BECOMES ALL CHILDREN. AND EQUITY BECOMES AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THOSE WHO HISTORICALLY HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEM. IN JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO THAT LA COUNTY ARTS COMMISSION RELEASED OF WHAT IT'S CALLED AT THE ARTS EDUCATION PROFILE. OF WHICH WAS A COUNTY WIDE SNAPSHOT OF THE STATE OF ARTS EDUCATION IN ALL EIGHTY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I WOULD PUT FORWARD THAT. IT'S OF POTENTIALLY A MODEL FOR HOW. TO USE DATA COLLECTION OR HAVE TO SHOW THE IMPACT AND VALUE OF THE ARTS AND DATA COLLECTION STATEWIDE -- IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS REPORT WE BUILT ON THE DATA ALREADY COLLECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH TRACKS HIGH SCHOOL COURSE WORK. BUT WE ALSO ADDED ELEMENTARY DATA WE LOOKED AT BOTH DISCRETE ARTS INSTRUCTION SO ARTS COURSES. AND INTEGRATED ARTS INSTRUCTION AND WE LOOKED AT THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY ARTS PARTNERS IN THE PROVIDING ARTS INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOLS. AND WE DID THIS FOR THREE REASONS ONE IS WE WANTED TO COLLECT MEANINGFUL DATA THAT THEN WE CAN GET BACK TO SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN DEVELOPING THEIR OWN PLANS FOR ADVANCING THE ARTS SO THAT THEY WERE LOOKING UP WHAT WAS REALLY IN PLACE. AND IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES FOR AYE AT FILLING GAPS. WE ALSO WANTED THE DATA TO BE PUBLICLY OF AVAILABLE WE WANTED PERRANCE IN ONE PART OF TOWN TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S BEING OFFERED IN THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE THAT WITH WILL WHAT'S. WHAT OUR CHILDREN ACROSS TOWN PERHAPS IN A BETTER SOCIAL ECONOMIC NEIGHBORHOOD? WHAT ARE THEIR CHILDREN RECEIVING IN TERMS OF ARTS INSTRUCTION? AND THEN FINALLY WE WANTED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUANTITY. THE QUALITY AND THE EQUITY OF ARTS INSTRUCTION THAT WERE IS PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS. AND WE HAVE OVER TWENTY TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN LA COUNTY. I'M WE RECEIVED A DATA BACK FROM -- MORE THE FROM JUST UNDER A THOUSAND SCHOOLS AND BECAUSE THIS DATA REPRESENTS FORTY SEVEN PER ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN OUR COUNTY WE WERE ABLE TO GENERALIZE THESE FINDINGS ACROSS ALL DISTRICTS. SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT NEARLY OF SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTY OFFER ARTS INSTRUCTION TO THEIR STUDENTS. I HAVE THEM DOUBLE CHECK THIS DATA THREE OR FOUR TIMES BECAUSE WITH THE CONSTANT BUT THE CONSTANT WAY WE TALK ABOUT THE ARTS OR THE ARTS ARE FIRST TO BE CUT I WAS SHOCKED THAT IT WAS THAT. MANY SCHOOLS PROVIDING ARTS INSTRUCTION. SO I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO BREAK THE MYTH THAT THERE IS NO ARTS INSTRUCTION PROVIDED IN SCHOOL. WELL THAT WAS TRUE FOLLOWING PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE AND WE NEED TO WORK HARD TO CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE -- WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ARTS ARE BEING TAUGHT LIFT UP MODELS LIKE JACK WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF MODEL SCHOOLS SO THAT OTHERS CAN LEARN FROM THEM -- AND TO USE THIS AS A NEW BASELINE FOR MOVING FORWARD. BUT AS WE DIG DEEPER INTO THE DATA WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT 90% MEANS THAT. 90% OF SCHOOLS ARE OFFERING SOME ARTS INSTRUCTION TO SOME STUDENTS FOR SOME PART OF THE YEAR [inaudible] AND IT BECOMES AN INCREASINGLY MORE INTERESTING AS WE LOOK AT SCALE AND EQUITY SO WE KNOW THAT AS EXPECTED MUSIC AND VISUAL ARTS ARE MOST OFTEN TAUGHT. WE KNOW THAT LESS THAN HALF OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS PROVIDE ANY INSTRUCTION IN DANCE THEATER OR MEDIA ARTS. AND ONLY A ABOUT A HALF OFFER ANY THEATER OR MEDIA ARTS INSTRUCTION. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT JUST SCHOOLS WITH FOURTH GRADE. WE KNOW THAT ONLY 10% OF SCHOOL OF SCHOOLS WITH FOURTH GRADERS PROVIDE YOUR LONG MUSIC INSTRUCTION. TO ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND LESS THAN 1% OF SCHOOLS WITH FOURTH GRADERS. PROVIDE YOUR LONG INSTRUCTION IN MEN ANY ART FORM TO ALL OF THEIR FOURTH GRADERS. SO 190% OF SCHOOLS OFFER SOME ARTS INSTRUCTION. LESS THAN 10%. WITH FOURTH GRADERS PROVIDE YOUR LONG INSTRUCTION. WE ALSO KNOW. THAT IF YOU ARE A STUDENT FROM A LOW INCOME IT COMMUNITY. IF YOU ARE AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER. OR IF YOU ARE A STUDENT OF COLOR. YOUR SCHOOL IS NOT ONLY PROVIDING LESS ARTS INSTRUCTION. BUT IS PROVIDING LOWER QUALITY ARTS INSTRUCTION THEN SCHOOLS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTY. AND THAT THE SCHOOLS WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF WHITE STUDENTS OFFER THE MOST ARTS INSTRUCTION AND THE HIGHEST QUALITY ARTS INSTRUCTION. IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE LA COUNTY ARTS COMMISSION RELEASED A REPORT CALLED CREATIVE WORK. AND WE WERE SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN EXAMINING THE CREATIVE OCCUPATIONS THAT WERE REFERENCED THIS MORNING SO THOSE JOBS THAT THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. IDENTIFIES AS NEEDING CREATIVITY IS ONE OF THE SKILLS FOR THOSE JOBS BUT THEY CAN BE FOUND ACROSS MANY AYE. INDUSTRY SECTORS. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT HALF OF THESE CREATIVE? OCCUPATIONS REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE. WHICH MEANS THAT HALF OF THEM DON'T. PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THOSE JOBS THAT DON'T REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE. BECAUSE OF THE ACCESSIBILITY. WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT -- THEY PAY ON AVERAGE A HIGHER MEDIAN ANNUAL WAGE. THEN THE COUNTY WIDE AVERAGE WHICH MEANS THAT THESE ARE. LIVABLE WAGE JOBS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. ALL YOU INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY COLLEGE BOUND HAVE ACCESS TO THESE LIVING WAGE. JOBS. LAST MONTH WE REACHED A RELEASED SOMETHING CALL ANOTHER FIELD SCANNED WHICH IS I BELIEVE IN YOUR PACKET. THIS CALL THE BUILDING CREATIVE CAREER PATHWAYS FOR YOU. I WOULD KNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S ONE OF FIVE RECENT OF STATE RESEARCH STUDIES ON THE CREATIVE ECONOMY RELEASED IN LA COUNTY OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IT GREW OUT OF THAT COUNTIES EFFORTS AT CULTURALLY CULTURAL EQUITY AND INCLUSION. AND IT IS LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT HOW. WE CAN PROVIDE ACCESS TO THESE TWO JOBS IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN LA COUNTY. INCLUDED NOT ONLY A LABOR MARKET ANALYSIS AND INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT I WILL SAY THAT ONE OF THE MOST KEY FINDINGS WAS THAT THE FIELDS. DEVELOPED A TYPOLOGY FOR THINKING ABOUT CREATIVE -- AND PATHWAYS TO THEIR CREATIVE ECONOMY SO A NEW WAY OF ORGANIZING. HOW WE PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE? WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT ARTS EDUCATION K. TWELVE ARTS EDUCATION IS. THE FIRST STEP IN THIS PROCESS. CAREER EXPLORATION MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES KNOW WHAT THESE JOBS ARE IS IMPORTANT. THAT'S DISTINCT FROM. CAREER A COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS MAKING SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN ARTS CAREERS ARE WELL PREPARED TO BE ACCEPTED INTO THOSE FIELDS. AND THEN COMPLETELY SEPARATE WORK BASED LEARNING. WHICH INCLUDES INTERNSHIP SO OFTEN WE LUMP ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND NOW THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THEM DISTINCTLY IT'LL ALLOW US TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES AROUND EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PREPARATION. THIS CAN ALSO IDENTIFIES CHALLENGES. PARTICULARLY FOR SYSTEMS INVOLVED YOUTH FOSTER YOUTH THOSE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM -- DOES THAT HAVE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. THOSE THAT ARE NOT ABLE -- TO PARTICIPATE IN UNPAID INTERNSHIPS BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES DON'T COME FROM -- AT THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO WILL TO SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THESE PROCESSES. AND ALSO CHALLENGES FOR BID FOR BUSINESSES AND THAT WHAT WE CALL THE ELUSIVE ENTRY OF ENTRY LEVEL JOB. SO MANY INTRO LEVEL JOBS THAT ARE BEING FILLED BY -- YOUNG PEOPLE WITH MASTERS DEGREES AND ALSO ON THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR CORPORATIONS. SO -- ENDS WITH SAYING THAT -- FORTY YEARS AFTER PROPER PROP. THIRTEEN WE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE COLLECTING THE DATA SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE WE STAND AND WE CAN CONTINUE TRACKING PROGRESS FORWARD. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHO IS AND WHO ISN'T RECEIVING ARTS INSTRUCTION. AND TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE EVERY CHILD. IS RECEIVING INSTRUCTION ALL YEAR EVERY YEAR. SO THAT EVERY PERSON IN. THE STATE ENGAGES IN THE ARTS ALL YEAR EVERY YEAR JUST BECAUSE IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL. PART OF HUMAN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. AND IT'S NOT ONLY THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO AT THIRTEEN YEARS OLD BEFORE THEY GET INTO HIGH SCHOOL. ALREADY KNOW WHAT CAREER THEY WANT TO GO INTO AND ARE SELECTING A PARTICULAR MAGNET OR C. T. BAG AT SCHOOL OR C. T. A. C. T. PATHWAY. BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THESE JOBS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE WALL TO APPLY ALL OF THE THE LA COUNTY ART YEAH COLLECTIVE. AND BOARDS OF STRAPPING. ON TO THE VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- ISSUE THERE TO COLLECTING DATA YOU KNOW WE CAN ONLY OBJECTIVELY IMPROVE THINGS THAT WE CAN MEASURE. SO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO THE STARTED THIS PROCESS AND COLLECT THE DATA. TRUMP'S SEVENTY ALL OF YOUR EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICT IS REALLY REALLY COMMENDABLE CAN I GO OUT OF THE QUESTION OR WE SHOULD LEAVE THE QUOTE TO YOU CAN PROBABLY ANSWER THE QUESTION. WHEN WE GO WAS TO THE NEXT PRESENTER BUT I'M JUST? VERY CURIOUS TO FIND OUT IF THE LIST AT ANY PUSH BACK. FROM THE TEACHERS OR ADMINISTRATORS OF THE SCHOOL TO SAY HEY YOUR GIVEN US -- ADDITIONAL OF OF WORK -- AND HAVE NO FUNDING ATTACHED TO IT. I REALLY LIKE TO FIND OUT. US SO TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT WE TRIED -- TO WE WORKED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA COLLECTION WAS TIME -- AT THE SAME TIME OF THE YEAR THAT THE STATE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS COLLECTING THE DATA SO THAT -- THEY CAN GO HAND IN HAND. AND WE I USED IT AS AN INCENTIVE TO THEN GO BACK AND HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS DEVELOP THEIR OWN REGIONAL PLAN SO WE PROVIDED THEM RESOURCES IN TERMS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR BRINGING THE ARTS BACK INTO THEIR SCHOOLS. AND SO WE FUNDED THE DATA COLLECTION FOR THEM TO AND TO TO REALLY PART TIME TO LUNCH THERE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE MOVE ON TO THE THE NEXT TO A PRESENTER. CLOSE WITH. HIS SHOES YES SIR. THIS IS A GAME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SAY I I TRULY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR ALL OF US AND SPECIALLY FOR ME IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE. AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS A LITTLE BIT OF MY FEELINGS ABOUT THEIR ARTS EDUCATION AND THE NEED FOR THAT. AND THEN -- TO PRESENT TO YOU SOME INFORMATION -- I'M THE CHAIR OF CREATE CALIFORNIA AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CREATE IS. AND I ALSO CURRENTLY SERVES A PRESIDENT TO THE MORENO VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT GOVERNING MORE. AND IT MIGHT MIGHT COME IN SOME GOING. TO INCLUDE A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT IT IN THAT PERSPECTIVE. TO BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THREE CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT -- IT IS IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION AND SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS ARE HERE TODAY -- BUT BEFORE I DO THAT -- I HAVE A PRESENTATION AND I'M GONNA GO THROUGH IT AND AND THAT MAKE MY COMMENTS ON THAT. SO THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS IS THIS -- GIVEN THE GROWTH OF CREATIVE INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE. WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR STUDENTS IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM SIX POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS ATTENDING OUR SCHOOLS? AND WHEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SOON AS ARE NOT ONLY YOU -- WELL PREPARED FOR THE WORKFORCE BUT ALSO. CREATE THE CREATIVELY PREPARE FOR ANY CAREER TO DATE THEY DECIDE TO PURSUE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL THE THE THEY NEED THAT CREATIVITY. IN AND THE DATE THEY NEED TO BE FULLY PREPARED WITH A WELL ROUNDED EDUCATION WHICH INCLUDES ARTS EDUCATION. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE MOST POWERFUL -- PATHWAY FOR STUDENTS TO DEVELOP. THAT DOES CREATIVE THINKING SKILLS ARE THROUGH ARTS EDUCATION IS CRITICAL. IN THE EARLIER WAS STARTED IT AND BE A KETTLE SYSTEM TO BETTER BECAUSE THE MUCH PREPARE THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE. FOR THE WORK FORCE. AND THAT NOW THAT WE SEE THE THERE'S A LOT OF CAREERS AND THE AND THE WITH CREATIVITY NEEDED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO TO PURSUE THAT. SO. WE HAVE A CHARTER THAT SHOWS -- THREE THREE DATES IN THREE YEARS. THREE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN HISTORY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TODAY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADVOCATE THAN WHAT WE'RE WORKING FOR AND THEY ALL THE SAME THE RESULTS HERE ARE LOOKING UP INFORMATION. IS RELATED THIS TO SOMETHING THAT WE ALREADY HAD IN THE PAST. AND THESE THREE PIECES OF LEGISLATION ORTIZ -- THREE THREE MARKS IN HISTORY -- DID SOMETHING. FOR WHAT USED TO BE -- THE ONE OF THE MODELS IN THE NATION AS FAR AS CREATIVITY CATION. IN CALIFORNIA THESE THREE MARKS -- DID SOMETHING PROBABLY AN INTENTIONALLY BETTER. CAN DISMANTLE WHAT WAS HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AND ARTS EDUCATION. AREA [inaudible] AND THE TODAY -- WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE BEFORE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN WE HAD THAT -- THAT -- YOU KNOW THE MARK TO BE THE CREATIVE STATE IN THE NATION [inaudible] SO. WHEN WHEN THOSE THREES -- THREE THREE LEGISLATION TO PLACE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. SOME ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR ARTS BECAUSE THEY STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE ARTS AT THE TIME AND PTA MANY OTHER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUE TRYING. TO TRY TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH SOMETHING RELATED TO THE ARTS SO THAT THE WASN'T. TOTALLY -- TOTALLY GONE FROM SCHOOLS. BUT WHAT HAPPENED -- WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE WITH THE WITH THE NOT THEY'RE NOT RESOURCES AND ON MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS. WHAT HAPPENED WAS AT THE TIME THE EQUITIES IN THE DIVIDE BETWEEN STUDENTS AND AFFLUENT AREAS AND ON THERE ARE DESERVE POPULATIONS WAS CREATED? SO FROM THAT POINT FORWARD WE HEARD ABOUT. THE INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN SCHOOLS SOME STUDENTS GET MORE SOME STUDENTS GET LESS SOME STUDENTS DON'T GET ANY AT ALL. SO THAT WAS CREATED BECAUSE OF THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION SO AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE -- SENATOR ALLEN EARLIER YOU SAID AND IT'S BASED ON THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT. THE CREATIVITY IN THIS CREATIVE ECONOMY ONLY ONE OF TEN JOBS IN CALIFORNIA ARE. IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. AND SO HE WILL GIVE OUR STUDENTS AN AXIS FULL ACCESS TO OUR TO THE CATION ALL THE WAY FROM THE KATE KATE -- GREAT TO THE TWELFTH GRADE. WE DON'T GIVE THEM ACCESS THEN WE'RE CONTINUING LOSING THOSE JOBS IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY. SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT THE WE WE CONTINUE SAID IN THE BASE A SEVEN THERE'S STRONG PILLARS AND THE CREATIVE. INDUSTRY SO THAT WE HAVE MORE JOBS [inaudible] THAT. SO. CRITICAL FORTY IS A COALITION OF DEDICATED INNOVATIVE LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT TOGETHER WE HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE LASTING CHANGE FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT. AND OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE ALL STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL -- BY EVENTS IN AN INDICATION MODEL THAT PROMOTES CREATIVITY IN THE ARTS. SO I TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FORMER SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ATTEMPT OR LOOKS ON SEND A TEAM TO THE NATIONAL EDUCATION LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE. TO LEARN A LOT OF TO NOTE TO LEARN ABOUT THAT. ARTS EDUCATION AND THEY CAME BACK WITH THE ON FIRE TO ELEVATE CREATIVITY AT THE HEART OF EDUCATION. THEY CAME BACK WITH A LOT OF IDEAS THAT CAME BACK WITH A LOT OF A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS. SO -- WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TIME THAT THEY WENT CREEK CALIFORNIA WAS FORMED INCREASE CALIFORNIA IS AGAINST THE COALITION -- AND AND MAINLY FORM -- I'VE REPRESENTING FIVE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE CONTINUE WORKING AND HAVING THEIR THE COLLECTIVE IMPACT -- ON NOTE ON CREATIVE CREATE -- ARTS EDUCATION IN THE STATE. AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE TOP. THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE RECTIFICATION. CALIFORNIA STATE PTA THE CALIFORNIA OUR SCHOOLS ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE TREMENDOUS ADVOCATES FOR THE ARTS AND HAVE CONTINUES WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ON DIFFERENT INITIATIVES. AND INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY ENOUGH TO CREATE CALIFORNIA WE'RE TRYING TO WORK -- SO THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THAT PARTICIPATION OF THOSE THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND YOU CAN SEE MANY AREAS THAT. EACH OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING ON A PDA VERY STRONGLY -- INCLUDING GAUGING THE PARENTS IN THE ARTS. CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION WITH OUR TONSILS OUT TO THE ORGANIZATIONS AND ON AND ON AND ON AND OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITH A DIFFERENT. INITIATIVES AND THE DIFFERENT -- AREAS -- THE DATE THAT THEY CONTINUOUSLY -- PURSUIT. SAW THREE TELEPHONE IN THE POLICY COUNCIL IS -- TRYING -- TO BRING UP THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING OUT ON AN IMPROVING THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THE ARTS. SINCE THEY SUPERINTENDENT BY THE CONSTRUCTION AS THE COALITION. TO PRODUCE A BLUEPRINT FOR CREATIVE SCHOOLS. WHICH WOULD THE FOCUS AND SEVEN AREAS. SEVEN AREAS AND WHICH INCLUDED OVER SEVENTY RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE OUR TO THE CATION AND STATE. THE YET THE COUNCIL -- AFTER THE LIGHTS IN THE BLUEPRINT AND AT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT AREAS WERE DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS. IDENTIFIED RESEARCH AND DATA AND EQUITY AS THE TWO AREAS THAT NEEDED TO BE FOCUS ON FIRST. SO WITH THAT -- I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AND ONE OF THM IS -- RELATED TO THE DATA THE HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY TODAY. THE DATA PROJECT AND CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST STATE TO PARTICIPATE ALLOW TO THE DATA AFTER THE NEW JERSEY PROJECT YOU JUST HAD A PROJECT WHERE. WHERE THEY WERE AND LICENSE CONTINUOUSLY THE DATA FOR ARTS EDUCATION AND STATE? SO CALIFORNIA WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR SO THEY TOOK ON THE BIGGER SAY PILOT. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE JUST AS DOES AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT IS AND IS THIS IS THE DATA PROJECT IS A DASHBOARD THAT THAT INCLUDES. INFORMATION. FOR ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ALL HIGH SCHOOLS MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. AND OF COURSE -- AT HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE SEVERAL TIMES THE ELEMENTARY INFORMATION IS NOT COMPLETE YET IT'S NOT THERE. BECAUSE THE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO BE SUBMITTED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND AND I LIKE TO ADD HERE COMMENT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHE WOULD TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON ON SUBMITTED THAT. THE BILL THAT THAT IS LOOKING FOR REQUIRE IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION TO BE SUBMITTED. BECAUSE I THINK IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION NOT ONLY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL. BUT ALSO AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL IF WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS. TO ASSIST OUR STUDENTS AND TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THAT -- IN IN THE EVEN WHEN THE INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRE. SEVERAL DISTRICTS THE US BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL DISTRICTS TO MEET THE INFORMATION ANYWAY BUT IT'S ONLY ABOUT 70% OF DISTRICTS STATEWIDE WE HAVE OVER ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SUBMITTED THE INFORMATION. SO THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THAT LEVEL. SO AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR THAT EFFORT BECAUSE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. AND THE IN THROUGH THE DASHBOARD WE HAVE LEARNED THAT ABOUT 39% OF MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN OUR STATE. RECEIVE OR HAVE ACCESS TO AND PARTICIPATE IN ONE OR MORE ARTS DISCIPLINES. AND THE THIS THESE LAST WORD ALLOWS YOU TO SEE A YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT COLOR STILL DO. YOU KNOW THE THE THE DARKER COLORS ARE MORE WHERE THEY COULD CALL LEASES ARE WITH THE CRITICAL. AREAS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED ON OUR AND THE CLEAR CALLERS ARE WHERE THERE'S SOMETHING GREAT BEING DONE. IN THE AREAS AND THEN -- THE OTHER PIECES THAT BAY INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS EARLIER AND YOU KNOW SOME DISTRICTS ARE DOING SOMETHING AT CERTAIN TIMES AND FOR ONLY CERTAIN STUDENTS. SO THE INFORMATION THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL TO HAVE IT. THAT WHEN WE COMPARE TO OTHER STATES IN THE NATION. THERE ARE TEN STATES THAT ARE USING THE DATA PROJECT -- TO ANALYZE THE DATA AND ARTS EDUCATION. I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE IN OUR STATE 39% OF STUDENTS HAVE THAT PARTICIPATION. IT WILL LOOK AT WISCONSIN WISCONSIN HAS 77% PARTICIPATION. IF WE LOOK AT OHIO HI IT HAS 82% PARTICIPATION. WHY IS IT THAT THE DIFFERENCE? WHEN I GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE THAT SHOW THE THREE MARKS IN HISTORY AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT THAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS CREATED WITH THOSE THREE MARKS? WITH THOSE TWO PIECES OF HISTORY THE PLACE. AND DISMANTLE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA SO NOW WE'RE AT AND AGAIN MANY ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING TO BRING IT BACK TO A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL. SO AGAIN -- THE BACK TO THE DATA CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE NOT REQUIRED REPORTING THE ELEMENTARY DATA. THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION. WHICH I BELIEVE IS -- IT'S BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO THE SYSTEM SO AGAIN I'D LIKE TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THAT INFORMATION. AND WE HEAR FROM SOME DISTRICTS THAT ARE WILLING TO TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BUT ALSO THAT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT. AND THE I HAVE MY NOTES HERE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT IS A BILL TO YOU. THE QUEUE -- AUTHORED AND AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THAT. AND THE SAD TO HEAR THAT IS NOT HAVING. PERFORMANCE BUT GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO SUBMITTED AGAIN. IN THE FUTURE OF ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE EQUITY GAP WHICH WHICH AND AND THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY. WHEN YOU GO IN AND YOU CAN SEE ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE THAT ANY ANY HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU CAN SEE [inaudible] THAT -- SOME GRABS TELL YOU THAT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING LESS OR THAT HAVE ACCESS TO LAST YEAH ARTS EDUCATION ARE DOES THAT ARE ON THE DAY. THE FREE LUNCH PROGRAM. THAT MEANS THAT THE STUDENTS ARE THE LOW INCOME AREAS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE NOT HAVING. ENOUGH AXIS. YEAH SO SO THAT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE CONTINUE FIGHTING BECAUSE IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE LOW INCOME AREAS TO NOT HAVING. THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO TO NOT HAVE THAT ACCESS AND TO EXPLORE THEIR TALENTS AND SKILLS AND THE CREE TV. THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY OF OTHERS. TO ANOTHER PLEASE THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION TO YOU IS A THE DECLARATION OF STUDENT RIGHTS TO EQUITY IN OUR LEARNING. CREATE CALIFORNIA PRODUCED A DECLARATION OF STUDENTS RIGHTS. WHICH IS A A DOCUMENT THAT EXPLAINS IN SIX SIX ITEMS WHAT THE STUDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION. AND AND THERE IS A THE STUDENT RIGHTS TO EQUITABLE [inaudible] ARTS EDUCATION. MEANING THAT ALL THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO TO THE ARTS ONCE AGAIN. ALL THE STUDENTS EVERY SINGLE STUDENT. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE EMBEDDED THIS DECLARATION IN -- TO BOARD RESOLUTION [inaudible] AND WE HAVE A MAP IN OUR IN OUR WEBSITE AND CREATE CALIFORNIA WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED AND WHAT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE IT READY ABOUT ADOPTED THESE. RESOLUTION AND I I HAVE CONCERT HERE I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT MARIN THE VALUE WAS THE FIRST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE THAT ABOUT THAT. SUCH RESOLUTION. AND IT IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE MADE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS AND WE'RE WORKING. VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN OUR DISTRICT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE ORDER SCHOOL DISTRICT'S OTHER SCHOOL BOARDS. TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION AND DO THE SAME THING THAT WE'RE DOING AS WELL AS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. GAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE STUDENTS. TO ARTS EDUCATION EQUITABLE. ARTS EDUCATION. NOT EARLIER -- SEVERAL SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT THE NEW STANDARDS. AND CREATE CALIFORNIANS PARTNERS ARE WORKING TO BUILD AWARENESS ABOUT THE NEW STANDARDS IN WORKING ON WAYS TO HELP EDUCATORS. UNDERSTAND THE NEW STANDARDS. WHICH EVERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR PREVIOUS STANDARDS. SO -- THIS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED -- AND SO WE'RE VERY AWARE AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT SO OF IN A STUDY CONDUCTED BY OUR A PUBLIC RELATIONS COMPANY WE REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES THE IMAGE THAT PUBLIC MY CALLED BAR TO THE KITCHEN IS THAT IT'S A NICE THING TO HAVE. YEAH THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AND IN MANY MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS NOT ONLY READ ABOUT IT BUT IN OTHER AREAS. TOO AB AND THAT WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF HAVING A GOOD QUALITY EQUITABLE EDUCATION. AND AND HAS TO BE MEANINGFUL THE HAS TO BE -- BY LINE WITH THE STANDARDS AND AND THAT. THE CREATING BAD WELL ROUNDED EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS TO START JUST HAVING A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PEN OR PENCIL. AND ALLOWING THE STUDENTS DO WHATEVER THEY WANT THAT HAS TO BE STRUCTURE. AND NOW IT'S HARD TO COMMUNICATE THAT THAT TO STUDENTS AND TO EDUCATE OR SOMETIMES AND TO THE PARENTS. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO FINDING PROPERLY WHAT ARTS EDUCATION THIS IS NOT JUST. CHILDREN AS PLAYED BY. MANY POOR ARTS EDUCATION SO -- WHAT WE HAVE AND MARK ON IS A CAMPAIGN TO SHOW THAT CREATIVITY IS NOT OPTIONAL? IN THIS OUR PUBLIC WILL CAMPAIGN DOUBTS THAT ARTS EDUCATION IS A POWERFUL PART OF THE CORE CURRICULUM AND IT IS A BETTER THAN DAY AND THE EDUCATION CODE. THAT ARTS EDUCATION IS PART OF THE CORE CURRICULUM SO WE WANT TO STRESS THAT TO ALL THE CHIU GATORS AND STATE THROUGH. YOU THAT THE RESOLUTION OR TO OUR CAMPAIGN. OR TWO WEBSITE MANY MANY DIFFERENT OR OTHER AREAS AND THE IS A PART OF A PART OF THE CORE CURRICULUM THAT CAN DELIVER THE CREATIVE THINK IS A PROBLEM SOLVER STEP WE NEED IN ALL OF OUR INDUSTRIES. AT THE END OUR LEADERS AND NOT ONLY THE CREATIVE -- INDUSTRY WORK BUT IF THE ANY ANY -- INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE -- THE THERE IS A NEED FOR THAT CREEPY READING AND THE AND THEIR MINDS AND STUDENTS [inaudible] SO. THE LIGHTS LIKE. WHAT IF EVERY SCHOOL WAS A CREATIVE INCUBATOR THAT STUDENTS CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO EVERY SINGLE DAY? SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE AND THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THAT WE WANT TO CREATE IN OUR SCHOOLS WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO BE EXCITED TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE NORMALLY THEY'RE ACADEMICS BUT BECAUSE THERE'S A PIECE OF ART WAITING FOR THEM. SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN TRULY EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS THERE THINKING -- DECREE TV. AND WE SEE A LOT OF EXAMPLES IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND THAT'S WHY WE IN THE ONE OF THE VALUE WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT TO OPEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND IT IS HAPPENING ANYWHERE DIRECT CITED TO SEE THAT HAPPENING IN THAT ALL LEVELS FROM KINDERGARTEN TO TWELVE RATE AND ALL THE AREAS. TO BUT WE RECENTLY HAD A A A AN ADVANCE IN PALM SPRINGS AND SUMMIT ARTS SUMMIT WOULD WE INVITED SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE AREA TO JOIN US. AND THE HIGHLIGHT WAS -- WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN READ THE BALLOT HOW IT'S HAPPENING AND HOW IS IT BEING DONE? SO WE'RE PLEASED TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH WITH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE. AND THAT. THAT'S MY PRESENTATION THANKS SO MUCH. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH -- AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE AND THE COMMITTEES SPECIALLY TO THE A STUDENT -- FIVE OF THE DID -- SLIDE GOOD FOR THE LAST. ONE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE CREATIVITY. RIGHT NEXT TO A MENTAL HEALTH. YOU KNOW I I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A LOT OF OUR OUR TO MONEY THROUGH OUR CONSUL CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY GOING. TO THE JUNE I HALL TO THE PRISON. AND AND TO TO TO TO VETERAN TO ASSOCIATION TRYING TO HELP TOMORROW -- WAS THERE OF A MENTAL YOU SHOES AT AS WELL SO -- ANY QUESTIONS. CENTER [inaudible] YEAH. I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION OF BOTH FOR NEEDS IS A WHAT IS YOUR SUCCESS IN AN L. A. CONTE. WOULD YOU HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO USE THAT DATA. TO GO AFTER SOME PRIVATE FUNDING PRIVATE GRANT INSIDE I WOULD THINK. WOULD WOULD -- LISTED THE TO THE DISCREPANCY THE GAP. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OF PRIVATE SECTOR THE BILL. ALSO WANTED TO CLOSE THE GAP FOR THE ARTS A COLLECTIVE IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP SO FUNDED BY LA COUNTY GOVERNMENT. AND THE PULL OF THIRTY PHILANTHROPIC CORPORATE AND FOUNDATION PARTNERS. ON SO HAD THEY DID HELP FUND THE AT THE DATA PROJECT -- AND WHILE I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PHILLIP PHILANTHROPIST PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN. RISK TAKING INNOVATION TRYING NEW MODELS TESTING NEW PROTOTYPES -- IT'S REALLY THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING THAT ALLOWS SCALE AND SUSTAINABILITY. AND WOULD PUT FORWARD THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT MATH INSTRUCTION -- WE DON'T THINK ABOUT PHILANTHROPY AND NONPROFIT ARTS OR NOT NONPROFIT COMMUNITY PARTNERS STEPPING IN TO PROVIDE THE BULK OF INSTRUCTION. AND SO -- I WOULD OFFERED THAT WE'RE AT A UNIQUE MOMENT WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE WITH THE NEW STANDARDS BEING PASSED THE NEW FRAMEWORK COMING ON BOARD. I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT -- MINE WAS THE GENERATION. THAT WAS HIT BY PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WHICH MEANS THAT. ANYONE IN THIS ROOM YOUNGER THAN ME COULD HAVE GONE THE COMPLETE K. TWELVE EDUCATION WITHOUT ANY ARTS INSTRUCTION. SO IF WE REALLY ARE GOING TO LOOK AT BROAD SCALE SYSTEMS CHANGE AND REALLY GET TO ISSUES OF SCALE IN EQUITY. THEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO THINK OF THE ROLL OUT OF THE FRAME WORK SIMILAR TO HOW WE THOUGHT OF COMMON CORE. THAT WAS A DRAMATIC SYSTEMS CHANGE ACT COULD A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN HOW WE THINK ABOUT EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT. REALLY PUTTING THE ARTS BACK IN EVERY SCHOOL FOR EVERY CHILD WE'LL TAKE THAT KIND O INVESTMENT TO ENSURE THAT TEACHERS HAVE THE SKILLS AND ABILITY TO REALLY IMPLEMENT ARTS INSTRUCTION K. [inaudible] TWELVE RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW -- WE DO GO. TO A PRIVATE SECTORS. OF FOR FUNDING ON FOR A GRANT TO PROMOTE OUR STEM EDUCATION WITHOUT THE AID IS NOT THE SAME EDUCATION SOLD. AT A DIRT THAT'S WHY WITH THINKING THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES. ALSO I THE GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TAP THEM FOR FOR ASSISTANCE. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT ARE GOOD TO AB. THREE NINETY EIGHT REALLY -- IT WOULD JUST PRETTY MUCH GOT GOT A GARDEN AND AMANDA IN THE ASSEMBLY -- I'M HOPING THAT WILL MOVE A BILL. TO PUT TOWARD THE CENTER SO I AM HOPING SENATOR ALLEN OR WILL HAVE A WOULD BE WORK TO WITH ALL OF YOU HERE. TO THE POST SO OFTEN NEED TO BACK INTO THE A. B.. THREE NINETY EIGHT WHAT'S THAT I'M GOING -- TO TURN IT OVER BACK TURN IT BACK TO SENATOR ALLEN FOR OURS. THIRTY THE FINAL SECTION OF OUR HEARING ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT SOME MEMBER AND AND WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT BILL CLOSELY THANK YOU TO THE THE PANELISTS. AND I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME OUR GOOD FRIEND A FRIEND OF THE ARTS -- CENTER -- NIELSEN USE YEARS WHILE HAVING JUST DRIVEN DOWN FROM HIS DISTRICT. SO WE WELCOME YOU SENATOR. I WHAT WE'VE BECOME SUDDENLY A LITTLE I'M TIME CONSTRAINT -- AS I COULD BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING BUT BUT LET'S LET'S WELCOME UP OUR NEXT PANEL WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP INTO TWO THIS IS PANEL THREE MENTORING CONNECTING AN INSPIRING YOU THROUGH THE ARTS WILL START WITH -- BUT IF MONEY FASTER GARCIA -- BONNIE WHO'S A GOOD FRIEND AND AND SOMEONE WHO WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH EDWARD JAMES OLMOS AND OTHERS ON THE LATINO FILM FESTIVAL USE IN A PROJECT -- KIANA CONLEY AND ALSO MICHAEL WE ARE AND WHAT WE INVITE THEM UP TO THE PRESENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] HI. THE BODY MAY YOU MAY HI. YEAH. THANK YOU IT'S A PLEASURE BEING HERE ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PRESIDENT OF THE LATINO FILM INSTITUTE -- WE HAVE TO PROGRAMS ONE IS THE USE AND A PROJECT -- WHICH AND WILL SHOW ON A MINUTE AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE LOS ANGELES LATINO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL SO IF WE COULD HAVE THE VIDEO -- YEAH. FILM. INFLUENCES THE HUMAN MIND IT'S A VERY POWERFUL MEDIUM THE WAY YOU ADDRESS DIVERSITY. IS BY GOING BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND STARTING IN FOURTH GRADE THE MISSION OF THE YOUTH SUMMER PROJECT IS VERY SIMPLE IT'S ABOUT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN THE CLASSROOM FOR MOST UNDERPRIVILEGED. CHILDREN AND TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE PROGRAM INVOLVES TWO FOR MAKING MENTORS GOING INTO THE CLASSROOM AND THEY TEACH THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF FILM SO HOW TO GENERATE IDEAS HOW TO WRITE THE SCRIPT. ALL THE PLANNING IN PRE PRODUCTION FILMING ITSELF IN PRODUCTIONS WELL AS POST THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. TREATING THE STUDENTS AS COLLEAGUES RATHER THAN. LECTURING TO THEM. INSPIRED THE COMMUNITY TO THE POINT OF WHERE. KIDS ARE ACTUALLY ATTENDING SCHOOL MORE WE TALK ABOUT PROJECT BASED LEARNING. SO RATHER THAN JUST TAKING A BOOK AND TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR SET OF CONCEPTS IN THE BOOK IT'S IT'S GOT A PRACTICAL APPLICATION. IS NOT BE SHY AND MYSELF. TO NEVER GIVE UP THE SAILOR IN THIS PROGRAM WAS TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS EXPRESS THEMSELVES. THEY THINK IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY TO APPROACH LEARNING THIS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM I KNOW. THAT BRINGS IN INDUSTRY IN THIS CASE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. INTO THE CLASSROOM. INTO THE SCHOOL SITE. INTO THE DISTRICT. CREATIVITY CRITICAL THINKING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION. ALL THOSE VALUES ARE SO MUCH A PART OF FILMMAKING WE CREATE LIFELONG LEARNERS. AND LIFELONG PROBLEM SOLVERS THIS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM I KNOW WHERE TEACHERS PRINCIPALS SUPERINTENDENTS IMPORTANT SAME DISKETTES 100%. I THINK THIS ROOM SHOULD BE. AROUND AGAIN THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS IT'S MORE LIKE LOOK AT THE BOARD AND YOU JUST GONNA LEARN THIS. AND HAND FILLED YOU ACTUALLY GOT TO MESS AROUND WITH EQUIPMENT. WHY ARE YOU HERE SAME? HERE WE KNOW WHICH I WOULD HAVE HAD THIS CLASS WHEN I WAS IN THE FOURTH GRADE. MY WORK WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO TRY TO GET THE YOUTH CENTER PROJECT INSIDE EVERY FOURTH GRADE CLASS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES I AM THE FOUNDER. AND CREATOR OF THE USE OF THE PROJECT NUMBER -- ITS PROJECT BASED WE TOOK THE CURRICULUM OF THE AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE WHICH IS A MASTERS BASED PROGRAM ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. TOOK THEIR CURRICULUM AND PUT IT pDESIGNED THE INTERFACE WITH DOCTOR RICHARD MILLER WHO WAS AT THE TIME SUPERINTENDENT SANTA ANA SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I WHEN IT FIRST STARTED I FEEL AT AND THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT EDWARD JAMES OLMOS FOUND. AT THE TIME THIS BEGAN I THOUGHT WELL. WHEN YOU WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU DO A FILM BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS DONE BY THE HEADS? THE YOU TAKE THIRTY KIDS DO. EVERYONE OF THEM RIGHTS TELLS A STORY FIRST. THEY WRITE THE STORY. A BREAK UP INTO FIVE PRODUCTION TEAMS. THEY DECIDE WHICH ONE OF THE STORIES COUNTY FILM. ALL OF THEM DO THE SCRIPT. THEY ALL DECIDE WHO'S GONNA DO WHAT JOB. ARE THEY START WRITING THE SCRIPT STORY BOARDING THAT GOING THROUGH PRODUCTION USUALLY BY JANUARY. ARE THE END OF IT THEY DECIDE WHAT MUSIC THERE'S GOING TO BE THEY GET THEM. THE MARKETING DONE ON AT THE BEGINNING WE ALL FORM AN LLC. SO THEY KNOW THE BUSINESS THEY KNOW THE BUSINESS SIDE OF IT. THE PRINCIPAL BECOMES THE CITY SO THEY HAVE TO GET A PERMIT TO FILM ANY PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. ARE THE THEY THEN HAVE THE FILM SHOWN AT IF THEY'RE IN ELEMENTARY IT SHOWN AT THE OSCARS THE ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURES ARTS AND SCIENCES AND ACADEMY. PAYS FOR THE BUS AND LUNCH. IF THEY'RE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL THERE SHOWN AT CREATIVE ARTISTS. IN THE NORTH -- WE HAD THE FILM SHOWN PIXAR BECAUSE WE'RE TO STATEWIDE -- THE NEXT SHOWING AND THIS IS WHERE THEY SEE THEIR FILM UP ON ON THE BIG SCREEN A PROFESSIONAL SO. WE ASK THAT THE NEXT SHOWING BE THE COMMUNITY SHOWING WHERE THEY CAN ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN THE HOUSE OF LAST YEAR WE HAD WHAT WE CALLED AN INDUSTRIAL SHOWING WHICH IS THEIR FILMS ARE SHOWN. AT THE LOS ANGELES LATINO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL WHICH IS THE LARGEST MOST PRESTIGIOUS. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ON MOBILE PHONES. AND WHAT WE DID THIS TIME WAS WE PUT IN A USE PROGRAM I USE CINEMA. FESTIVAL. WHERE WE SHOWED HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE FILMS? AT CHINESE THEATER -- IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL FOCUS WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE WORLD. THE REAL IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES YEAH WE GO. RIGHT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. RECENTLY WE'VE -- RANGE AN AGREEMENT WITH CHAPMAN WERE CHAPMAN'S GIVING TEN SCHOLARSHIPS A YEAR. TWO SANTANA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES -- THEY GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND NOT IN TO SELL IT IS INTO ALL AREAS. BECAUSE WE KEEP SAYING THAT THE PRODUCT IS THE STUDENT NOT THAT FILL. AND IT'S ALSO -- WE CONNECTED IT TO THE FILM FESTIVAL BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT SHRINKING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. AND GIVING KIDS OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS IN THE INDUSTRY. OUTCOMES ARE I ONLY HAVE ANECDOTAL DATA RIGHT NOW -- BUT WE HAVE RETAINED OF STANFORD'S CENTER FOR ASSESSMENT LEARNING INEQUITY TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE. STUDY WHICH IS COMING OUT IN JUNE. BUT SOME OF THE PRELIMINARY INDICATIONS ARE -- HAVE BEEN STANDING. SO FOR INSTANCE IN ENGLISH -- LITERACY OR ACQUISITION -- WHEN COMPARED TO OUR CLASS? A NON YCP CLASS HAD KIDS THAT TESTED AT SEVEN KIDS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WERE PROFICIENT. AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEMESTER WENT TO EIGHT OUR CLASS SIX WERE TESTED PROFICIENT AND BY THE MIDDLE THE YEAR WENT. TO THIRTEEN IN RALEIGH WHICH TESTS OUT AT YOU KNOW THERE STATEWIDE TESTING. AT THE THIRTY FOR THIRTY PERCENTILE. I MEAN AND IT'S VERY. OUR OUR KIDS AVERAGE. THE FIFTIETH IN THE ONES IN OUR CLASSES I MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THEY'RE GOING TO BE UP TO A YEAR BUT THE REASON FOR THE OUTCOMES. AS I VAST SUPERINTENDENTS IS BECAUSE EVERY KIDS ENGAGE. NOBODY IS THERE ALL ENGAGED AND THEY ALL WANT TO BE THERE. AND SO THINGS HAPPEN ATTENDANCE GOES UP -- THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN SCHOOL AND ANOTHER THING HAPPENS THEIR TEAMMATES COLUMN UP TO MAKE SURE THEY GET TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY GOT TO GET THE PROJECT DONE. BY THE END OF MAY -- SO AND THE MOVE SOME DRAMATIC THINGS HAVE HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS -- THERE'S A THING CALLED EL TELLS AND THAT'S IN SOPHOMORES AND HOT THAT'S IN HIGH SCHOOL WERE LAKE TRANSITIONING WITH. ONE AND THE DATA ON THAT'S PRETTY STUNNING BECAUSE IF YOU'RE INTENT GREATER HIGH SCHOOL YOU HAVE A TRANSITION YOU'RE NOT GOING. TO THE NUMBERS ARE THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE KIDS THE TRANSITIONS ABOUT ZERO ONE IF YOU'RE LUCKY. TO CAMPBELL UNION BROUGHT THIS PROGRAM INTO THEIR SCHOOL AND IN THE FIRST SEMESTER. THIRTY OUT OF THIRTY TWO KIDS TRANSITIONED INTO ENGLISH. AND SO. OF THAT THE DISTRICT DECIDED TO DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM. IN FACT OUR BEST ASSESSMENT IS OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER WHAT OF OUR DISTRICTS DONE -- ARE DISTRICTS PALMDALE STARTED WITH ONE THEY'VE EXPANDED TO THREE CLASSES WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT NEXT YEAR. SANTA ANA STARTED -- IN FOURTH GRADE THEY NOW HAVE A FULL PATHWAY. OUR OTHER DISTRICTS HAPPENED. NOW THE CHALLENGE IS FINDING OF COURSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT. ARE THERE ARE NO FREE LUNCHES THIS COSTS BECAUSE WE PAY FOR IN THE INDUSTRY TO COME IN AND GET THIS DONE. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE SOLUTION -- NUMBER ONE IS THIS IS VOCATIONAL BECAUSE WE GIVE KIDS ACT I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD BUT IT'S CAREER TRAINING. WE GIVE KIDS AN OPTION. TO THEY WANT TO GO THE ACADEMIC ROUTE. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A PATH FOR THAT. BUT BY THE END OF THAT FOURTH GRADE CLASS EVERYONE OF THOSE KIDS KNOW THAT EVERY JOB IN THE FILM ON A SET. SO THEY CAN DECIDE WHICH WAY. THEY WANT TO GO AND AGAIN THIS PURPOSE OF THIS ISN'T TO CREATE FILMMAKERS. IS TO CREATE LIFE LONG LEARNERS. OUR AND WE HAD AND I JUST GIVING YOU A SNIPPET OF OUR DATA -- AND IT'S BEEN PRETTY SPECTACULAR. I CAN'T. UNDER ESTÃ¡ OVER YOU KNOW I CAN'T OVERESTIMATE IF YOU WILL THE IMPACT OF BRINGING IN THE PROFESSIONAL SIDE LOLLIES. AND OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY PEOPLE. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN URGING FOLKS TO GIVE OUR KIDS -- INTERNSHIPS IN HIGH SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH THE USUALLY DON'T DO IT TO ABOLISH. AND A AND BECAUSE OF OUR KIDS. THEY KNOW ABOUT THE BUSINESS -- THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY SATISFIED SO THE CATEGORY AND OTHER FOLKS -- SO MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN GIVING HIGH SCHOOL INTERNSHIPS VERSUS -- COLLEGE. ONE SO -- WITHOUT MORE. GONNA TRY TO KEEP MY TIME. SO EVERYBODY CAN GET ELECTION TIME. SO ONE IF I WERE TO HAVE ASKS ONE WOULD BE. IF WE CAN WORK WITH THE RULES SO THAT MY TEACHERS AT VERSUS MY MENTORS -- IN THE DISTRICTS THAT WE HAVE CAN QUALIFY FOR C. T. FUNDING. TO THE UP THE THE OTHER BIG DEAL HERE IS. YOU KNOW THE TYPE. FINANCES THAT THE DISTRICTS HAVE. AND WHAT I'VE NOTED IS THAT YOUR TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUPERINTENDENTS. THEIR SUPERINTENDENTS WHO ARE WANTING TO TAKE THE RESOURCES AND INVEST. AND GET OUT COMES -- WHERE THEY'RE GETTING AND THEY ARE GETTING ALL COMES? OUT WHERE THEY'RE HAVING EXPANDED ATTENDANCE -- INCREASED TENANTS AND THEY SEE VALUE -- IN DIFFERENT WAYS EVEN IN UP TO AND INCLUDING THEIR ADA SO THAT'S AN INVESTOR SUPERINTENDENT. AND THE OTHER ONES ARE I'M JUST SO OVERWHELMED BY MY BUDGET DEFICITS I REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO BRING IN AN OUTSIDE PROGRAM I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN HERE. AND THOSE ARE VERY THAT'S A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO ALLOCATE OR IN CASE ENHANCE FUNDING. SO THAT DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO INVEST CAN GET SOME ASSISTANCE IN INVESTING. AND SO THAT'S OUR SECOND THING THE OTHER FINAL POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT. WE ASK AND WE GO INTO THE MOST CHALLENGED. DISTRICTS AND WHEN WE GO INTO A DISTRICT WE SAY WELL OF COURSE WE'RE HERE TO SERVE YOU. BUT GIVE US YOUR MOST CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT -- WE ARE IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH ROUTE IN -- IN. BRAWLEY ALL THE WAY UP TO ALLEN WRONG. BROUGH -- WE ARE -- PALMDALE OXNARD -- AND WE SAY THAT WE ARE THE LATINO FILM INSTITUTE YOU CINEMA PROJECT. NOT BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON WHAT THE NO KIDS. IT IS BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED BY THE LEFT IN A COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE -- EXPENSIVE TURN WHEN IT AS A GIFT TO ALL CHILDREN. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE AT RISK. YOU CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS. BUT THAT ARE AT RISK COMMUNITY AND THAT'S EVERYBODY -- GETS A LOT OUT OF THIS AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS PROGRAM. NOW THIS REAL SPECIAL WORK WITH THE WITH THE YOUTH I MEAN I AND I AND I AND I ALWAYS SEE THESE ABSENT OUR REGARDS TO TO MISTER ALMOST AS WELL AS AND AND YEAH INSPIRATION BEHIND THAT SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION -- LET'S MOVE FROM FILM TO MUSIC -- AND OTHER IMPORTANT. GO FROM FROM. FROM -- AN OSCAR SO THE GRAMMYS -- WILL LITERALLY HAVE WILL GO TO THE KEY ON AND AND MICHAEL SO SO -- THE RECORDING ACADEMY AMONG OTHER THINGS -- RUNS THE THE GRAMMY -- WORDS IN IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- DRIVER IN IN OUR IN OUR MUSIC THE MUSIC SIDE THE CRITICAL NEED WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY AND SO. I CAN HAVE -- THIS EXACTLY RECTOR OF THE RECORDING CARRIES LA CHAPTER AND THEN MICHAEL UP IN SAN FRANCISCO SO REALLY DOES.

THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY THANK YOU THE US AND AROUND THE THANK YOU TO HEAR CHIU US OVER TO LAUREN TO ALL OF YOU FOR FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY IT'S AND IT'S ALWAYS AN HONOR TO BE ABLE. TO SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC IN CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO EDUCATION BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT. THE PART OF OUR WORK -- AS SENATOR ALLEN MENTION MY NAME'S MICHAEL WINNER ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE RECORDING ACADEMY SAN FRANCISCO CHAPTER. WE ARE A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION -- I AM ALSO A SONGWRITER PRODUCER ENGINEER FORMER TOURING ARTIST AND KIND OF RUN THE GAMUT OF ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR GIGS YOU CAN DO IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY -- SO IT'S IT'S IT'S BEEN REALLY FASCINATING TO BE HERE TODAY AND LEARN. AND OF HOW THE STATE IS FUNCTIONING WITHIN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY -- I'M ALSO THE PARENT OF A THREE AND A FIVE YEAR OLD WHO ARE BOTH NOT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND IT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART SEE. HOW THE STATE WORKS ON BRINGING THEM INTO OUR CREATIVE WORLD YEAH THEIR EDUCATION -- JUST ABOUT THE RECORDING ACADEMY WE AS AN ORGANIZATION REPRESENT THE VOICES OF PERFORMERS SONG WRITERS PRODUCERS ENGINEERS AND ALL MUSIC PROFESSIONALS SO THAT'S WHAT OUR MEMBERSHIP IS MADE OUT OF WE'RE DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT THE RECORDING ARTS. REMAIN A THRIVING PART OF OUR SHARED CULTURAL HERITAGE -- IT IS ALSO WE ALSO INVEST IN WE HONOR OUR HISTORY AND ALSO INVEST IN OUR FUTURE THROUGH THE GRAMMY MUSEUM AND THE GRAMMY MUSEUM FOUNDATION -- WHERE WE DO A LOT OF WE ALSO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF MUSIC CREATORS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN? STATE CAPITOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS IN WASHINGTON DC -- AND THEN WE ALSO HELP MUSIC CREATORS IN TIMES OF NEED THROUGH MUSIC CARES WHO PROVIDES -- FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE WITH HEALTH OR FINANCIAL CRISES TO MUSIC PROFESSIONALS -- AND OBVIOUSLY AS SENATOR ALLEN MENTION WE ALSO ARE -- WE HONOR ARTISTIC EXCELLENCE THROUGH THE GRAMMY AWARDS WHICH IS -- MUSIC'S ONLY PEER RECOGNIZED ACCOLADE SO OUR AWARD IS ACTUALLY PRESENTED TO MUSIC CREATORS BY MUSIC CREATORS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY ROUD OF AND AS THE WORLD'S LEADING SOCIETY OF MUSIC PROFESSIONALS -- WE WORK YEAR ROUND TO FOSTER A MORE INSPIRING WORLD FROM MUSIC CREATORS. GOOD GOOD EARLY AFTERNOON AS THE EARLY MORNING HI -- MY NAME IS KIANA CONLEY I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES AFTER THE RECORDING ACADEMY -- BUT I THINK PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY I AM A NATIVE ANGELINO I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN HAWTHORNE CALIFORNIA -- ICE BOYS. I ACTUALLY WENT TO THE SAME ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AS BRIAN WILSON -- AS I LEARNED ABOUT WHILE I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND HAVE KEPT THAT WITH ME -- SO YEAH THERE'S A SANDBOX THERE I THINK WE YES WE PLAYED ON THE SIX I'M SO. LONG LOVE OF HIS EXACTLY -- AND SO YES I AM YOU KNOW AND THEN AND THEN THEY'D A NATIVE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR THE SOUTH BAY AREA -- BUT I ALSO AM EDUCATED I HAVE BEEN EDUCATED THROUGHOUT -- MY SCHOOLING IN ARTS PROGRAMS -- IN ARTS EDUCATION -- I HAVE BEEN BOTH A PERFORMER MYSELF -- INVOLVED IN MUSICAL THEATER AND THEN WHEN I WENT INTO I STUDIED AT THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE WHERE I ALSO LET -- A BIT OF OUR DANCE PROGRAMMING THERE AND THEN WHEN I GOT INTO UNIVERSITY ONCE YOU SCA -- AND CONTINUED AND PERFORMING ARTS THERE -- THOUGH I WAS ALSO IN BUSINESS AND DECIDED THAT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WAS A CAREER FOR ME SO BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE VALUE OF ARTS EDUCATION FROM -- ELEMENTARY ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO COLLEGE -- IS VERY CLOSE TO MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- AND AND I AM OF THE BENEFACTOR OF WHAT WAS OFFERED HOWEVER SMALL IT MAY HAVE BEEN -- AT THAT TIME SO WHILE WE ARE BEST KNOWN OFFENDER AND A BENEFICIARY AND OF AN ASSOCIATION ARE A BENEFACTOR KNOWN ABOUT THIS YEAR THANK YOU. WHILE -- WE ARE BEST KNOWN FOR THE GRAMMY AWARDS WE ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION AS MICHAEL HAS SAID -- WERE MADE UP OF CAREER PROFESSIONALS AND CREATORS IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IN MANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE NAMES THAT YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE -- THE MANY MORE OF THEM WORK AND LESS VISIBLE AREAS OF THE INDUSTRY. ALL THE MAKE UP A KEY PART OF WHAT IS THE FABRIC OF OUR CREATIVE ECONOMY AND MOST OF THEM HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO RECIEVE MUSIC EDUCATION -- WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP? SO IN CALIFORNIA IS WHERE OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE BASED WERE BASED IN LOS ANGELES IT'S THE HOME OF THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF OUR ORGANIZATION -- MY MEMBERSHIP AND IN LOS ANGELES REPRESENTS ONE QUARTER OF OUR MEMBERS ABOUT THE WHOLE WE HAVE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS AT THE LA CHAPTER. IN OUR OTHER CALIFORNIA CHAPTER SAN FRANCISCO OF REPRESENTS THE FOURTH LARGEST -- IS THE NEXT LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S THE FOURTH LARGEST WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION JUST BEHIND NEW YORK AND NASHVILLE SO COLLECTIVELY -- OUR STATE REPRESENTS EIGHT THOUSAND OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR ORGANIZATION ABOUT A THIRD OF THE OF THAT -- THAT GROUP AND AND LARGELY REPRESENTS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS PROBABLY -- A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA AS LIKELY THE CREATIVE CAPITAL THE U. S. I THINK IT'S QUITE ARE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT THE EPICENTER OF THE MUSIC AND A PRIZE IN THE FOUNDATION. IS BASED IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY -- THE NORTHERN AND THE AND THE SOUTHERN REGION. YEAH I'M AND MUSIC AND ARTS EDUCATION ADVOCACY IS ACTUALLY REALLY ARE. A CRITICAL PART OF THE WORK THAT WE DO I RECORDING ACADEMY -- AND THAT IS WE RECENT WE ALSO DO AS I MENTIONED NATIONAL ADVOCACY RECENTLY PASSED THE MUSIC MODERNIZATION ACT -- THROUGH THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS UNANIMOUSLY THROUGH BOTH HOUSES -- AND SIGNED INTO LAW WHICH IS THE FIRST MAJOR COPYRIGHT LAW TO PASS THROUGH THE SINCE -- NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WE BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT SUPPORTING MUSIC CREATORS AND COPYRIGHT OWNERS IN GENERAL THROUGH LEGISLATION IS CRITICAL. BOTH FOR PROTECTING OUR FUTURE -- MUSIC MAKERS AS WELL AS OUR CURRENT MUSIC MAKERS -- AND RIGHT NOW ARE YOU ARE LEGISLATION SUPPORTS FOCUS ON STABILIZING THE FINANCIAL FUTURE OF OUR OF OUR WHOLE INDUSTRY. AND WE CAN'T SEPARATE THE NEED FOR PREPARING THE CREATIVE FOUNDATIONS OF THOSE WHO WILL. INHERIT -- CREATIVITY IS DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN CALIFORNIA'S IDENTITY -- WE ARE KNOWN AS THE STATE THE CONTINUES TO CREATE THE MOST POPULAR WORKS OF ART IN THE WORLD -- WE CALIFORNIA IS SYNONYMOUS WITH MUSIC AND FILM AND CREATIVITY. AND WE ARE A BEACON TO CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS EVERYWHERE I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I MOVED HERE FROM GEORGIA. WHICH IS STILL IN A LOT OF OUR OUR PEOPLE FROM. OUR STATE BUT I MOVED HERE FROM THERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAD SUCH A RICH CULTURE AND SUCH AN IMPORTANT. PLACE FOR BRINGING IN. VOICES THAT CAN DO WHAT WHATEVER FEELS RIGHT TO THEM THERE'S SUCH FREEDOM HERE THERE'S SUCH A SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY AND A NETWORK IN A FABRIC OF PROFESSIONALS FROM ALL KINDS OF GENRES AND I THINK. AS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE STUDIES THAT WERE PRESENTED. THE VARIETY THEM INDUSTRIES JUST THE HUGE DIVERSITY OF CREATIVE INDUSTRIES IN THIS STATE MAKES. MAKES FOR A UNIQUE CULTURE THAT EXISTS PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHERE ELSE. AND AND SO FOR US -- CREATIVITY IS ALSO AT THE HEART OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. AND PRETTY MUCH ALL OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ENTREPRENEURS IN ONE SENSE OR ANOTHER WE ALSO REPRESENT SOME OF THE SMALLEST BUSINESSES. YOU CAN THAT CAN EXIST A SONG WRITER IS OF FREESTANDING SOLO ENTERPRISE AND THEY CAN. MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM ONE SINGLE HIT THERE LIKE THE GOLD DIGGERS OF THE PAST SO. THIS IS IT THIS IS THE WAY THAT OUR ECONOMY IS OFTEN FUNCTIONED AS BOOMER BUST IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS NO DIFFERENT -- OUR MEMBERS ARE THE CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS THAT MAKE THE MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO TODAY YOU YOU KNOW THEIR WORK WHETHER YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE OR NOT AND AND IT AND I'VE AND I NOTICED THAT FROM THE STUDY WE ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY. WITHIN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR OUR MEMBERS AND THE PEOPLE MAKING THE MUSIC YOU EVEN HEAR ON THE RADIO OR THAT ARE TRENDING ON SPOTIFY. ARE MADE BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T FLY OVER THE RADAR AND THEY'RE NOT HIRED BY MAJOR CORPORATIONS AND THEY'RE NOT ON THE EASY TO READ TAX ROLLS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE. THEY'RE HUSTLERS. THAT IS THE THAT IS THE KEY PIECE OF OUR OF OUR OF ECONOMY THOUGH BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE HUSTLERS WHO ARE WORKING ON THE STREETS AND MAY NOT BE EVEN EARNING ENOUGH TO PAY TAXES FROM THE MUSIC CAREER. MAY EVENTUALLY GO ON TO BECOME MAJOR ARTISTS AND SO WE WE WE REALLY TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE SUPPORT AND REPRESENT THOSE PEOPLE AS WELL. ONE UNIQUE THING ABOUT THE ARTS OBVIOUSLY AS WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE -- TO STUDENTS THAT STUDENTS NEED TO DEVELOP THE CREATIVITY AND DETERMINATION NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS -- OUR CREATIVE ECONOMY AND WHAT WE CAN OFFER TO THE CREATIVE ECONOMY BY INVESTING IN THE ARTS IS PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS DECISION MAKING SKILLS CREATIVE THINKING. BUILDING SELF ESTEEM TEACHING SELF DISCIPLINE TEAM BUILDING COLLABORATION AND GOT ALL GREAT -- ACCOUNTABILITY LOS ANGELES NATIVE AND GRAMMY AWARD WINNER JOSH GROVE AND HAS BEEN QUOTED AS SAYING ALL OF THE THINGS IN ARTS EDUCATION GIVES A YOUNG PERSON ENHANCE THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND HELP RAISE GRADES. THE ARTS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CREATIVE TALENT AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND INFLUENCES CREATORS AS CHANGE AGENTS THAT ARE INTEGRAL AND LOCAL COMMUNITY SUCCESS AND PROVIDING FURTHER INSPIRATION -- SO WHETHER THEY YOU KNOW THERE'S A BENEFIT NOT ONLY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THEM -- LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA BASED ARTS EDUCATED MUSIC CREATORS THEY CONTINUE TO BE THE BACKBONE OF THE GLOBAL MUSICAL SUCCESS STORIES THAT HEAVILY INFLUENCE TODAY'S YOUTH CULTURE. SO WHETHER THE ARTIST HIMSELF IS OUT OF YOU KNOW -- A NATIVE TO CALIFORNIA OR NOT -- A LOT OF THE COLLABORATORS THAT THEY WORK WITH ARE ARE TYPICALLY ARTS EDUCATED MUSIC CREATORS. OF FOR EXAMPLE. LET'S SEE THE SECRET INGREDIENT IN THE MUSIC OF CURRENT HIP HOP CHANGE AGENT IN COMPTON CALIFORNIA NATIVE KENDRICK LAMAR WHO IS A THIRTEEN TIME GRAMMY AWARD WINNER. IS A FELLOW ANGELINO NAME TERRACE MARTIN AND TERRACE AS A MUSIC INSTRUMENTALIST PRODUCER THAT HAS APPEARED ON EVERY SINGLE KENDRICK LAMAR ALBUM. HE WAS ONCE POINT AS A CHILD PRODIGY WHEN RELEASED A MIXTAPE AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN AND THEN HE CONTINUED HIS ARTS EDUCATION BY STUDYING SAXOPHONE. AT SANTA MONICA HIGH SCHOOL -- AS WELL AS LOCK HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA I THOUGHT YOU'D APPRECIATE THAT AND PUT THAT BACK. ON VIKING -- ANY AND AND KENDRICK LAMAR TODAY IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE INFLUENCE AT THIS ARTS EDUCATED COLD MUSIC COLLABORATOR. HAD ON WHO CANTICLE MAR IS IN THE MUSIC THAT IS INFLUENCING THE YOU HE'S CURRENTLY THE TOP IN R. A.'S TOP TWENTY CERTIFIED% ARTISTS WERE DIGITAL SINGLES WITH OVER FORTY ONE MILLION UNITS -- BEING TRACKED -- SO THERE'S A DIRECT. CORRELATION -- TO HOW IT'S INFLUENCING THE YOUTH WHETHER THEY ARE THEMSELVES PARTICIPATING AS MUSIC CREATORS ARE NOT -- AND THERE ARE. A LOT OF STUDIES TO BACK THIS UP AS YOU ALL ARE NO DOUBT AWARE -- AND I LEARNED I KNOW I WAS TRYING TO SEND YOU THIS PRIOR TO THIS OR MAKING INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL BOOK YOU HAVE BUT JUST A FEW. THAT'S A THE THERE WE ALSO HAVE KIND OF CAME ACROSS IN OUR IN OUR HEARING THIS -- THE ANY I HAD COMMISSION TO TWENTY TWELVE STUDY -- THAT SHOWED THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM UNDER RESOURCE ENVIRONMENTS WHO ARE HIGHLY INVOLVED IN THE ARTS HAVE BETTER GRADES AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO DROP OUT MORE LIKELY TO GO ON TO COLLEGE -- THE COLLEGE BOARD'S NATIONAL TASK FORCE ON ARTS AND EDUCATION RECOMMENDS THE GREATER ACCESS TO ARTS EDUCATION CAN SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP -- INCREASING THE NUMBER OF UNDERSERVED STUDENTS THAT ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF EDUCATION -- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S TENURE REVIEW OF ARTS EDUCATION FUNDED PROGRAMS FINDS THAT STUDENTS IN ARTS PROGRAMMING HAD BETTER ATTENDANCE FEWER DISCIPLINARY ISSUES AND IMPROVED ON TAP ON TASK BEHAVIOR. RELATIVE TO COMPARISON STUDENTS -- ARTS EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP FIND SCHOOLS OF LARGE POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS AND ECONOMIC POVERTY CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO VIBRANT HUBS OF LEARNING WHEN THE ARTS ARE INFUSED INTO THEIR CULTURE AND CURRICULUM WHICH MONEY OBVIOUSLY POINTED TO JUST. JUST WITH ONE EXAMPLE THERE -- pEDUCATION TO CLEAR THE STATUS OF ARTS EDUCATION IN EQUITY ISSUE AND A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE SINCE SCHOOLS OF HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF STUDENTS IN POVERTY WERE LESS LIKELY TO OFFER ARTS EDUCATION YEAH AND I CAN SEND YOU LINKS TO ALL OF THOSE. STUDIES WHEN THAT POINT WAS YOU KNOW VERY. THE PRESENTLY MADE BY MID BY THE KNEES YEAH YEAH YEAH. I JUST DON'T WANT TO ONE CAN KIND OF AS A AS ASTORY OF WHAT WE DO WHICH WE FIND KIND OF REACHING SOME OF THE HIGHER ACHIEVING STUDENTS WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED GRAHAM YOU AND I CAN ALL OF OUR CHAPTERS AND IT'S IT IS MADE. FOR FULL TIME COLLEGE STUDENTS -- WE SUPPORT MUSIC CAREER ENDEAVORS BY OFFERING EXCLUSIVE TALENT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND INTRODUCTIONS IN NETWORKING AMONGST PEERS -- JUST BEFORE THEY REACH THE MOMENT WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO ENTER THE WORKPLACE SO IT'S USUALLY A COUPLE YEARS INTO THEIR COLLEGE CAREERS THAT THEY TEND TO JOIN GRAHAM YOU -- AND PART OF WHAT THIS PROGRAM ALSO OFFERS ESPECIALLY IN OUR MARKET AND I KNOW YOU GUYS ALSO DO THIS AND AND BROTHER CHAPTERS WE WE HOW OFFER A MENTOR PROGRAM FOR A VERY SELECT GROUP OF OUR TOP TOP MUSICIANS AND INTRODUCE THEM TO THE PROFESSIONALS IN OUR MARKET PLACE I PERSONALLY HAVE MEANT SORT ABOUT SIX STUDENTS IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- IT'S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY BOTH FOR US AS PROFESSIONALS AS WELL AS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE AN INTRODUCTION TO THEIR PEERS. AND WHEREVER MENTORING AN APPRENTICESHIP IN IN TERMS ARE AVAILABLE. FOR INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES I SHOULD SAY NOT IN THE INTERIM. WE NEED BOTH -- BUT THE INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE. WE SEE GREATER -- BETTER OUTCOMES LONGER LASTING CAREERS AND HIGHER EARNINGS OPPORTUNITIES JUST IN GENERAL WE'VE SEEN STUDENTS TO GO FROM BEING COLLEGE STUDENTS TO BECOMING THE GENERAL MANAGERS OF RECORD LABELS ONE OF MY STUDENTS THAT I MENTOR FOR EXAMPLE SO -- AND WE HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT WITH GRAMMY YOU IN THE COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT WE WORK WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP. THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THAT PARTICULAR GROUP COMPARED TO OUR GENERAL PROFESSIONAL MEMBERSHIPS. ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE -- TEND TO BE GENDER BALANCED AND ARE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ETHNIC AND RACIAL DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE. SO -- CATCHING STUDENTS WHILE THEY ARE YOUNG AND BRINGING THEM INTO THE PROFESSIONAL PIPELINE OFFERING. EVEN AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL IS WE'RE FINDING THAT THE THAT EQUITY AND DIVERSITY IS IS KIND OF BECOMING MORE THE NORM. THAN HIS WHAT WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY SO THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WE DO AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL WE TYPICALLY DO THAT THROUGH OUR NOT AT NOT. NON PROFITS -- ORGANIZATIONS THE GRAMMY MUSEUM FOUNDATION -- THEY OFFER A PROGRAM CALLED GRAMMY IN THE SCHOOLS AND WE USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY CONNECTS SUCCESSFUL ARTISTS WITH ASPIRING STUDENTS -- PERFORMERS SUCH AS FULL TIME GRAMMY NOMINEE LEGACY AND TWICE NOMINATED SINGER KALANI HAVE PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO -- WE CLEARLY RECOGNIZE THAT STUDENTS WITH STRONG MENTORING OPPORTUNITIES AND CAN GO ON TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF SUCCESS IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY THE GRAMMY MUSEUM FOUND THAT NATION ALSO OFFERS A SUMMER INTENSIVE PROGRAM CALLED GRAHAM ACCOUNT IT'S A FIVE DAY. NOT CURRENTLY NON RESIDENTIAL SUMMER MUSIC INDUSTRY PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN CAREERS AND MUSIC SO SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMMING IS ABOUT JUST EXPOSURE. TO MUSIC IN THE PROFESSION -- IN MUSIC BUT BUT ADDITIONALLY THIS PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT WANT A CAREER TRACK IN MUSIC AND THEN OFFER THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT. IN SORT OF THIS -- HEART BE OF LA -- IT'S IT'S A PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR A FEW YEARS AND IT IS A PROGRAM THAT EVEN THOUGH -- WE OFFER IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY. FUNDED IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY THEMSELVES -- HAVE TO ALSO GET SCHOLARS OF A LOT OF TIME IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEM ATTENDING THIS PROGRAM -- I KNOW WE NEED TO WRAP UP YES ARE KIND OF TIME SO -- ONE I GUESS JUST WE WERE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OBSTACLES FACING MUSIC EDUCATION WHICH REALLY COMES DOWN TO FUNDING. YEAH I THINK THAT WE'RE WE ARE CONSTANTLY RECOGNIZING IS A FIGHT WITHIN THE CAPITAL -- WE WE HAVE A VERY SIMPLE MISSION WHICH IS WE WANT TO MUSIC TEACHER IN EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS THAT AT OUR WE FEEL THAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY -- ENDS THIS THIS SIMPLE GOAL ISN'T EASY BUT WE WE WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO SEE -- THE FUNDING LEVELS PER PUPIL REACH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE -- WAY I HAVE OF I BELIEVE IT'S TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PRISTINE ROUGHLY -- WHICH WE WERE HERE LAST WEEK WITH THE NAM FOUNDATION IN CALIFORNIA'S AGHAJ CATERS ASSOCIATION TO TALK ABOUT WITH. A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOLKS HERE IN THIS BUILDING SO -- WE HOPE THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL CAN CONSIDER ON JUST RAISING THE PER PEOPLE AVERAGE AND ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN FOR FOR YOUR WORK LAST YEAR ALONG WITH WHEN WITH OUR PARTNERS OF CALIFORNIA LINES FOR ARTS EDUCATION -- IN PASSING GRANT PROGRAM -- TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS WERE GETTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING RESOURCES MAY I GROW IT YEP. OKAY REALLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR ALSO HAVING ME AND AND YOUR HEADQUARTERS AND LESSONS THAT WAS GREAT -- AND THIS GREAT LEARNING ABOUT THE WORK YOU'RE DOING. LET ME ASK I JUST FINE BEFORE WE BEFORE MOVING THE NEXT PANEL ON IMAGE I RECEIVED WE BOTH TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE MONEY I GET THAT. I WANTED TO JUST ZERO IN A LITTLE BIT ON ONE PARTICULAR ASK YOU HAD TO DO WITH THE WITH THE CATEGORIZATION C. T. FUNDING AND AND WHAT'S STANDING IN THE WAY IN TERMS OF THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WE WE COULD. GET FIXED CURRENTLY A TEACHER HAS TO HAVE ONE THOUSAND YEARS -- HOURS OF EXPERTISE IN THE AREA. FOR THE QUALIFY -- FIFTY FIVE WE ARE ACTUALLY TRAINING THE TEACHERS THAT ARE IN THE CLASS BY THE TIME THEY GOT THREE YEARS WHICH IS NOT NOT THOUSAND HOURS. BUT IT IS VERY INTENSE. BECAUSE OUR KIDS IT'S AN IN SCHOOL PROGRAM NINETY MINUTES TWICE A WEEK -- AND THERE ARE AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE IN THE CLASS BY THEMSELVES THEY'RE THERE WITH OUR PROFESSIONAL. SO IF YOU COULD CATEGORIZE IT SAY HE LOOKS EITHER A THOUSAND HOURS FOR INSTRUCTION. OR TEEN TEACHING WITH PROFESSIONALS FOR SOME FAT YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY TWO THREE YEARS WHAT THAT DOES THAT THAT GIVES. THE DISTRICTS INCENTIVE HEY WAIT A MINUTE IF I GO WITH THIS AND I DEVELOP THE PROGRAM. BY YEAR THREE I CAN HAVE EVERY TEACHER THAT I HAD A CLASS AND THEN I CAN GET SOME SUBSIDIES OR SOME EXTRA FUNDS. FOR THESE CLASSES OKAY -- BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT AT THE IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I COULD ASK YOU TO TEAM UP WITH DAN AND LEARN ON THAT -- TRIP TO TACKLE SHOP ABOUT MAYBE WE CAN MAKE ALL THE CHANGES IN THE RULES -- TO YEAH YEAH YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THE THREE OF YOU AND THEY AND OUT ONCE AGAIN AND THEY'RE SUCH COOL WORK BEHIND EACH OF THOSE PRESENTATIONS AND WE KNOW HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE BEING CHANGED. I THERE'S ALL THE ALERT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S CALL UP -- I'VE ACTUALLY COUPLE THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE -- THESE LIVES ARE BEING CHANGED WE HAVE SERRA BURKE BAKER AND CAROLINE BURKE BAKER WHO ARE -- STUDENTS IN STOCKTON UNIFIED I WE ALSO JUST A MARTINEZ IS THE PRINCIPAL FREMONT LOPEZ -- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE COULD TALK ABOUT THEIR WORK AND THEN AND THEN TIFFANY'S HERE IS WELL AS EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF TURN AROUND ARTS. CALIFORNIA -- SO I THINK WE'RE TO START WITH TIFFANY AND THEN GO ON TO PRINCIPLE MARTINEZ AND AND AND THEN THE THE BURKE BAKER SISTERS -- WE APPRECIATE YOU. CONFORMING WITH OUR A TIME FRAME RIGHT NOW TO DO APOLOGIZE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. LET'S START WITH YOU -- TIFFANY. GREAT FANTASTIC HIGH THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING US -- I KNOW WE'RE TAKE FOR TIMES I'M GOING TO KEEP MY REMARKS -- TO A MINIMUM BECAUSE I'M SUPER GRATEFUL. TO HAVE ONE OF OUR INCREDIBLE PARTNER SCHOOLS FREMONT LOPEZ ELEMENTARY WITH US OUR PRINCIPAL INTO INCREDIBLE. ALARMS FROM THAT SCHOOL ONE WHO ACTUALLY HAD A FINAL THIS MORNING. SO THAT'S THE DEDICATION. OF THEM COMING ALL THE WAY OVER HERE AFTER HAVING ALREADY TAKEN THE FINAL SO THANK YOU VERY. MUCH FOR COMING. I THINK WE'RE GONNA SHOW A SHORT VIDEO ON TURN ON ARTS AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON OUR WORK BEFORE YOU CAN HEAR FROM. OUR PARTNER REALLY GOT US EXCITED ON SOMETHING [inaudible] SEXUAL [inaudible] RUSHING. I FEEL LIKE. BECAUSE I JUST LOVE THE SOUND THEY GENERATE. THAT'S THAT'S THE VISCERAL RATE YEAH THAT'S HOW WE HELP TO CREATE PASSION IN OUR KIDS LIVES CLASSES BUZZING. YEAH SO -- THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SO MUCH FOR INVITING TURN ON ARTS CALIFORNIA -- SOMEONE NUMBER TWO IN YOUR YOUR HEARING. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WONDERFUL. AND THANK YOU LAUREN SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. SO I'M GONNA KEEP OUR HISTORY SHORT BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW TURN ON ARTS WAS BORN OUT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S IT RECOGNITION -- THAT WE NEED TO REINVEST IN THE ARTS -- AND THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE ON THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES -- RESEARCH AND ALL TO ACTION AROUND THAT REINVESTMENT -- AND THEN -- IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN TURN ON ARTS CALIFORNIA WAS BORN THROUGH THE VISIONARY LEADERSHIP OF FRANK YURI AND LISA SHRIVER. AND FIVE YEARS LATER WE ARE NOW PARTNERING WITH TWENTY FOUR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND IT IS OUR GOAL TO HELP IN POWER THOSE SCHOOLS THROUGH THE TRAM TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF LEADING THROUGH THE ARTS YEAH -- SO. I'M IT QUICKLY TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR APPROACH OUR RESULTS AND THEN I'M GONNA LET YOU TALK -- TO ONE OF OUR INCREDIBLE -- PRINCIPLES AND TO STUDENTS WHO REALLY LIVED IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE INTERESTING THAN THAN -- MORE IN TERMS OF ART FOR ME. BUT REALLY JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT OUR APPROACH IS A TURNAROUND ARTS. ITS THREE PRONGED WE LEVERAGE RESOURCES -- WITH OUR PARTNER SCHOOLS WE DIDN'T WE ASK FOR A COMMITMENT FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FINANCIALLY -- AND TO BRING A DISCREET ARE DEDICATION AND TO SUPPORT THAT ARTS EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THOSE SCHOOLS. TO WORK WITH ARTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO REALLY EMPOWER THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WE WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PS ARTS GET LIT VISUAL THINKING STRATEGIES SUNSET CENTER. AND WE REALLY FOCUSED ON BUILDING HELPING THOSE SCHOOLS. BILL THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THOSE LOCAL ARTS ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR GOAL IS THAT ALL STUDENTS IN THOSE SCHOOLS RECEIVE ARTS EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM YEAR ROUND AND IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE THAT. THAT IS WHAT OUR ASPIRATION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR SCHOOLS YEAH. THE SECOND THING WE DO WHEN WE REALLY DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS IN THE AST FEW YEARS BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING THIS AND LEARNING FROM IT. IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE ADULTS. INVESTING IN THE ADULT IN THE SCHOOLS OUR TEACHERS AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND REALLY HELPING THEM TO LEAD THROUGH THE ARTS. SO WE PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COACHING AND TRAINING. TO THOSE PRINCIPLES TO THOSE TEACHERS NOT ONLY -- IN THEIR CORE SUBJECTS BUT ALSO IN ARTS EDUCATION REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE USE ARTS INTEGRATION TO EMPOWER TEACHERS TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE TOOLS. TO ENGAGE. OUR KIDS IN AND HELP THEM TO LEARN IN CREATIVE WAYS -- THE THIRD THING THAT WE DO IS WE ALSO PARTNER WITH HIGH PROFILE ARTISTS AND WE BRING THEM INTO THE SCHOOLS. AND THE SCHOOLS THAT WE PARTNERS WITH I SHOULD SAY ARE THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED -- FEDERALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA AS HIGH PRIORITY SO NOT ONLY ARE THEY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS THEIR SCHOOLS WITH KIDS -- AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOW INCOME THEY'RE ALSO SCHOOLS THAT ARE. ESSENTIALLY LABELED ON HISTORICALLY LABELED LOW PERFORMING. AND THERE'S OFTEN A NARRATIVE -- THAT FOLLOWS -- THOSE COMMUNITIES -- AND CAN BE REALLY -- NOT SUPPORTIVE TO THEIR IS THRIVING AND SUCCESS AND PART OF WHAT WE DO WITH WORKING IN THESE HIGH PROFILE ARTISTS WORKING WITH THE KIDS BRINGING MEDIAN VISIBILITY THE SCHOOLS IS TO SHOW THAT. THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOLS HAVE JUST AS MUCH ABILITY IN POTENTIAL AS ANY OTHER SCHOOL YEAH AND TO HELP ALL THE THAT COMMUNITY THE TEACHERS THE STUDENTS TO SEE. THEY ARE AT POTENTIAL NOT AT RISK YOU HAVE TO REALLY HAVE SUCCESS [inaudible] SO. THE RESULTS THAT WE FOCUSED ON AND WHEN WE WERE ORIGINALLY -- CREATED IT WAS BASED ON A NATIONAL PILOT -- THAT LOOKED AT HIGH PRIORITY SCHOOLS ACROSS THE NATION AND PROVIDED ARTS EDUCATION AND THEN LOOKED AT OTHER SCHOOLS THAT JUST WERE JUST RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THE RESULTS WERE SIGNIFICANT THAT THOSE KIDS WERE PERFORMING BETTER IN SCHOOL. AND THAT'S TRUE IN OUR PROGRAM BUT ONE THING THAT WE HAVE FOUND AND THAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT AND DIGGING INTO EVALUATING. IS WHEN WE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS.% OUR PARTNER SCHOOLS THE TEACHERS THE PRINCIPALS THE COMMUNITIES REPORT TO RENT DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN THE SCHOOL CULTURE AND CLIMATE. AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO US OUR TEACHERS ARE MOTIVATED AND ENGAGE AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NEW TOOLS AND NEW WAYS TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE ARTS TO LEARN AGAIN NOT JUST DIRECT ARTS EDUCATION BUT ALSO IN THE CORE SUBJECTS. USING OUR DEDICATION. I'M OUR STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED NOT ONLY ATTENDANCE BUT REALLY LOOKING AT TEACHER SURVEYS AND HOW THEY ARE ENGAGED IN THE CLASSROOM IN THE LEARNING PROCESS. AND THEN THE THIRD IS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. HOW DO WE GET OUR FAMILIES TO OUR SCHOOLS AND THESE ARE SCHOOLS WHEREFAMILIES ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO SUPPORT THEIR KIDS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET THEM INTO THE INTO THE SCHOOL OR MAYBE THEY DON'T FEEL? WELCOME AT THE SCHOOLS WE REALLY FOCUS ON BRINGING THEM IN LEARNING THEM IN THROUGH THE ARTS. TO WORK WITH WITH TEACHERS PRINCIPALS AND STUDENTS -- AND THEN WE ALSO SEE A HIGHER TEST SCORES WITH OUR STUDENTS. BUT WHAT WE REALLY FEEL IS THAT THOSE INITIAL INDICATORS ARE ARE REALLY ABOUT READING IS TO LEARN WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW THE ARTS SUPPORTS ARE SHOWN THE ABILITY TO LEARN. BUT WHAT IT ALSO DOES THIS OF COURSE THEY'RE READY MISS TO LEARN RAIN WATER THESE KIDS. CHECK THE BOX FOR A LOT OF ACES STUDY INDICATORS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE WITH THE FEEL JOY AND WILL THEY FEEL -- INTERESTED IN YOUR AGENT AND LEARNING. SO I'M GONNA END THERE BECAUSE I'M VERY EXCITED TO INTRODUCE PRINCIPLE MARTINEZ WHO'S BEEN INCREDIBLE PARTNER. TO TURN AROUND ARTS -- AND ARE TO STUDENTS. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN AND ASSEMBLY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY -- THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE PARTNER WITH HER ON ARTS -- WE WERE TOLD THAT ARTS USE ARTS IS A TOOL NOT A ROSE OKAY SO WHAT WE LOOKED AT THE OR WHEN I'M ENGAGING MY KIDS I SAID WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE THE ROSE. AS WE DEVELOP THE TOOLS SO WE DEVELOPED OUR PATHWAYS. AND EXPOSURE WE GIVE KATE THROUGH FOR EXPOSURE TO THE ARTS AND IN FIFTH THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE WE GIVE THE PATHWAYS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE A PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PATHWAY. AND THEN LEADS TO A HIGH SCHOOL SO KIDS SEE PURPOSE SO THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE THING WE DID. THE NEXT THING WE DID WAS LOOK AT INTEGRATION STRATEGIES THROUGH THE CLASSROOM -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS THE TOOL AS WE WANT TO USE THE ARTS FOR THAT IT IS TIED TO STANDARDS IN THAT -- STUDENTS KNOW THAT WHEN WE'RE USING A LARGE STRATEGY IT HELPS TO LEARN. FOR CURRICULUM. THE LA STANDARD MASS STANDARD AND I THINK THAT'S WERE -- THE DIRECTION THAT THE ARTS DOES NEED TO GO IS GET INTO THAT CLASSROOM MAKE SURE THE BILL STRATEGIES ARE REAL. SO THAT NOT ONLY THAT THE DO THE TEACHERS KNOW HOW TO ARTICULATE TO THE STUDENTS THAT THEY ARE LEARNING THIS. THAT ARE LEARNING COMMON CORE STRATEGIES IN THE LA MATH. BUT THAT ALSO THE STUDENTS ARE DOING IT AND THE TEACHERS ARE DOING AND WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT MORNING IS TAKING PLACE -- IN THOSE AREAS. BUT THE MAIN THING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO AT FREMONT WAS TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS WITH PURPOSE. AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SKILLS SO THAT WHAT THEY WERE LEARNING AT FREMONT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY HEY I WANT TO GO TO CHAVEZ HIGH SCHOOL OR NO I DON'T WANT TO GO TO CHÃ¡VZ HIGH SCHOOL BASED OFF OF WHAT I LEARNED. FROM MY AND THAT'S KIND OF I'M GIVING YOU THE I KNOW WE'RE WERE WERE PRESSED FOR TIME. BUT THAT'S THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT I SAW AS FAR AS PRESENTING TO OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT EQUITY -- ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO IT. WHAT AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DOING SO THAT'S? THAT WAS THE MAIN DRIVE FOR THE PROGRAM SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE WAY THROUGH THE THICK THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. AND YOUR OFFERINGS TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE STUDENT LOOKS AT THEIR LONGER TERM HE EXACTLY OR ANYTHING YOU HEALTH YEAH YOU HAVE TO DO A FROM QUE ALL THE WAY IF YOU JUST RIGHT IF YOU GIVE IT TO ON THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH. GRADE IT'S JUST A FILLER REYES HAS TO BE WHO YOU ARE. OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU OKAY. NOW WE HAVE OUR OUR STUDENTS. SO MY NAME IS SARAH AND I'M A SOPHOMORE AT CEDAR TRAVIS HIGH SCHOOL AND FREMONT LIKE WITH MY OWN TO SCHOOL FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THE EIGHTH GRADE. AND I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE WHEN TURN ON ARTS WAS IMPLEMENTED OUR SCHOOLS AND I REMEMBER BEFORE THAT. REMOTE WAS A FAIRLY ROUGH SCHOOL LIKE THE ATTENDANCE WASN'T TOO GREAT BUT I FOUND THAT THROUGH THE ART. KIDS WERE LIKE SHOWING UP MORE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO COME TO THEIR MUSIC CLASSES THEY WANTED TO BE THERE FOR THEM. AND LIKE KIDS SO YOU'RE LIKE HEY MAN LIKE. STAY ON TASK BECAUSE YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR GRADES UP SO LIKE WE CAN GO TO LIKE THIS FUN STUFF MUSIC. SO LIKE. IT'S AN INCENTIVE TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO GOD LIKE BETTER YOURSELF THAT WAY YOU CAN ENJOY WHAT YOU'RE. HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. AND THEN FOR ME WHAT TURN ON ARTS IS LIKE BEEN MEANING TO ME IS I LIKE EVERY KID HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCOVER THEMSELVES THROUGH THE ART. IS ART CAN BE A VERY EXPRESSIVE THING TO WEAR. SOMETIMES MORE LIKE YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT STUFF IN WORDS YOU CAN EXPRESS THROUGH MUSIC SIR OR ARE EVEN DANCE -- TO WHERE IT'S JUST. EASIER THAT SENT. SO LIKE I FELT LIKE IT MEANS TO ME THAT EVERY KID DOES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND THEMSELVES AND JUST. HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WITHOUT THE ART. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE TURN ARTS LIKE AND JUST ARTS IN GENERAL LIKE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR MYSELF AS SUCH AS GOING TO THE COUNTY CENTER. I'M GOING TO WASHINGTON DC NOW TWICE. LIKE WITHOUT THE ARTS I WOULDN'T OF HOW THOSE OPPORTUNITIES I WOULD HAVE HAD THESE EXPERIENCES THAT MAKE ME WHO I AM TODAY. AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT TO MAJOR IN MUSIC WHEN I GO TO COLLEGE I WANTED ON THE MEDICAL FIELD. BUT MUSIC AND THE ARTS HAS STILL MADE ME A BETTER PERSON AND MAYBE BETTER PREPARED THAT. IT IS MADE ME LEARN HOW TO HAVE PATIENCE WITH MYSELF AND OTHERS. IT IS MADE ME BETTER IN MATH WITH COUNTING AND JUST RHYTHMS AND FIGURING OUT DIFFERENT. FORMULAS. AND THEN ALSO JUST LEADERSHIP AND HAVING LIKE BETTER SELF CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY OVER MYSELF. TO WHERE I AM NOW A BETTER PERSON THAT I CAN GO INTO WHATEVER FIELD I CHOOSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY MUSIC HERE. WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO COUNTY CENTER WOULD YOU YOU PERFORM THERE WAS YEAH IT WAS IT?

AFFECTED OUR GRADES EVERYTHING JUST THE OVERALL WAY WE GO ABOUT LIFE. AND IT WAS IF IT WASN'T FOR ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES I'VE HAD TO THE ARTS I WOULDN'T EVEN BE. AT THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO A JUST ACADEMIC HIGH SCHOOL JUST BASED ON MY LIKE LOCATION OF WHERE I LIVE. I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GIVING ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE THE ART. BUT THANKFULLY IMPLEMENTED INTO OUR DAILY LIVES I REALIZE THAT I HAD A PASSION FOR TEACHING AND TEACHING OTHERS.
