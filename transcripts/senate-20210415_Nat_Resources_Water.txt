WELL YES SIR MR CHIRLA COME TO YOUR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ELECT TO A PRESENT HERE FROM THE DIESTER AND I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE- WHAT YOU ALREADY SAID ABOUT SB. FOUR EIGHTY TWO WE VOLUNTARILY POSTPONED THE HEARING OF THAT BILL- TO UPDATE ONLINE SO- I'LL BE PRESENTING TO BILLS TODAY WITH THE CHAIRS OF PERMISSION. THE FIRST ONE IS SB SIX TWO FOUR WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY IN OUTDOOR ACCESS ACT- SO I FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND MY STAFF AND GLADLY ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. SB SIX TO FORCE A BILL THAT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AND PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY AN OUTDOOR ACCESS PASS A GOAL FOR ALL STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. THAT MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES AND SO IN ON THE YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF A CONSTANT THEME. IT'S KIND OF A CONSTANT BATTLE HAVING TO- FIGHT EVERY YEAR FOR EQUITY AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND I JUST THOUGHT. THAT I'D SAVE EVERYONE A LOT OF TROUBLE AT WORK ON A POLICY THAT WILL REALLY GO ACROSS- MANY DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY AND WORK AT CREATING EQUITY. AS SOMEBODY THAT WAS RAISED IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA I HAVE ALL THE BUT BUMPS AND SCARS ON MY HEAD TO PROVE THAT YOU KNOW MOST OF THE TIME. YOU KNOW IT WAS VERY HARD TO ACCESS TO PARKING IF WE DID THEY WERE USUALLY SMALL PARKS INADEQUATE FOR SPORT SPORTING ACTIVITIES- WE MOSTLY PLAYED IN THE STREET IN THE ASPHALT IN THE SIDEWALK AND- I CAN'T. BEGIN TO DESCRIBE ALL THE INJURIES I SUSTAINED AND ALL THE KIDS OF MINOR NEIGHBORHOOD SUSTAIN PLAYED TACKLE FOR FOOTBALL AN ASPHALT AND SOCCER THAN IF YOU CAN IMAGINE. AND THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN ACROSS OUR STATE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF SOCIETY WE HAVE. PEOPLE RECREATION AND DANGEROUS- THE STREETS AND IN- AREAS- WITH LOTS LOTS OF TRAFFIC AND MANY IN MANY CASES ARE OUR POCKET PARKS IF THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE ARE ARE NOT REALLY SUITABLE. FOR CERTAIN SPORTING ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE WORKED OVER THE YEARS AND MAKING OUR OUR COASTLINE MARC SENSIBLE. ON MAKING OF PARKS MORE ACCESSIBLE SO THIS BILL WOULD- BUT WORK ON PROMOTING EQUITY AND ENSURING ACCESS TO THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND IT'S BEEN A TOP PRIORITY OF THIS LEGISLATURE AT LEAST FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE BUT- AND WITH THERE HAS BEEN OTHER LEGISLATION THAT DEALS WITH WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THAT AND WE THOUGHT WE FILL IN A LOT OF THE BLANKS OF. PRIOR LEGISLATION SO. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS STATE AGENCIES HAVE TAKEN LARGE STRIDES IN DEVELOPING AND DEDICATING. RESOURCES TO- SEVERAL NEW AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THERE IS START. STILL AS I MENTIONED MUCH WORK TO BE DONE. TO REALLY ENSURE THAT DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION AND ACCESS ARE ARE TRULY PROVIDED. AS WE SAW WITH THE COVERT. THE IMPACTS OF COVERT AND THE STAY AT HOME ORDER HAVE REALLY MAGNIFIED OBSTACLES THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS FACED. ACCESSING OUTDOOR SPACES AND RECREATION FIRM FOR MANY COMMUNITIES IT WAS MUCH HARDER TO ACCESS THESE ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF THE ELIMINATION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND OTHER OF. OF TRANSPORTATION AMENITIES THESE EQUITIES WERE WERE DISPLAYED VERY CLEARLY AND FAMILIES WHO ARE WISHING TO GO OUTDOORS BUT DIDN'T HAVE A PARK WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. OR WERE DENIED ENTRY AT STATE PARKS AND BEACHES AFTER TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES TO THEM. DURING THE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS- THAT ONLY PERMIT LOCAL LOCALS. DURING CERTAIN TIMES MANY. OF MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY THAT RELIED ON. HAVING TO PLAN THESE EVENTS WERE REALLY LEFT OUT AND- DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO EXPLICIT AUTHORITY FOR STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO PROMOTE DRUM FOR PROMOTE TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. BY ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC BARRIERS TO ACCESS FOR THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY LACKED OR FACE DISPROPORTIONATE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO S. B. TWO FIVE SIX TWO FOUR WOULD ADD A NEW DIVISION TO THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. TO ADDRESS THIS. THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY HAS STATED THAT LORD PARK ACCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF BEING OVERWEIGHT. FURNISHES THE SPURS DISPARITIES ARE AFFECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THROUGH THIS BILL WE ARE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY IN PROMOTE EQUITABLE. EQUITABLE ACCESS TO DEMOGRAPHICS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH THE LEAST ACCESS TO THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES ARE MOST VULNERABLE. TO ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS THERE IS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND LOOKED TO HAVE EVERYONE SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR WILL SPEAK WITH A MASS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR WATCH SO. AND WE HAVE. TO- PEOPLE LISTED AS LEAD SUPPORT BOTH THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON THE CONFERENCE LINE.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR GRANTING ME TIME TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. I AM A CONSTITUENT OF SENATOR GLAZERS. EACH OF YOU HAS RECEIVED A CARNEGIE ASSESSMENT THE DOCUMENT INCLUDES THE HISTORY OF CARNEGIE STATE VEHICULAR RECREATION AREA WITH A FOCUS ON THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION PARCEL. OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO TWELVE MILLION ONLY TREE TRUST FUND DOLLARS WERE INVESTED FOR THE CARNEGIE SBRA EXPANSION. TWELVE MILLION WAS NOT A ONE AND DONE PAY OUT. DURING THE LAST TWENTY THREE YEARS STATE PARKS FIX THE SAN FRANCISCO WATER DISTRICTS MISTAKE COSTING ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. MITIGATION CONTINUES OF AN EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY MINING OPERATION. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES A CATALOG AND PROTECTED. FOR FUTURE PROJECTS REQUIRE PUBLIC INPUT STUDIES AND APPROVALS. B. O. H. M. V. R. DIVISION OF STATE PARKS HAS COMMITTED THE FUNDING TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT WHILE RESPONSIBLY DEVELOPING MULTIPLE USERS ACCESS. YOU WAITED NORTH OF CARNEGIE SCR A. R. LAWRENCE STATES HUNDRED. AND A GUN RANGE TO THE SOUTH ACCESS BIASED MAINTAINED ROAD LOOK. IS STAN WHICH IN. ALSO ACCESS BY THAT IS A CAT RANCH. AND DELETE HUNTING ENTERPRISE. THIS PARK NEIGHBOR IT KNOWLEDGE IN WRITING AT TIME OF PURCHASE SHE SAID THE ACQUISITION OF THE ALAMEDA CATHOLIC STILL WANTS TO EXPAND- H. THE OPPORTUNITIES. A COPY OF THIS DOCUMENT IS IN THE REPORT FOR YOUR REFERENCE. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS THIS NEIGHBOR'S NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AGAINST CARNEGIE S. B. R. A. N. D. ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THERE WILL BE PRESIDENT SACK WITH THIS LEGISLATION. WE CALL THE ESTATE OWNER WHO BLOCKED ACCESS TO THE BEACH FRONTING ITS PROPERTY. BEACH ACCESS IS STILL IN LITIGATION APPROVAL OF THIS BILL WILL SUPPORT HIS CLAIM THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHO CAN ACCESS HIS BEACH. WEALTHY AND POLITICALLY CONNECTED INDIVIDUALS WILL FIGHT THIS LEGISLATION TO ELIMINATE UNDESIRABLE FROM THEIR PARK. THIS IS LEGISLATIVE NIMBYISM. A SECOND PRESIDENT IS MUCH MORE WORRISOME BY STATUTE STANDARDS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS EXCEED THOSE OF PARKS UNDER FEDERAL STATE COUNTY OR CITY MANAGEMENT. R. S. B. TWO FORTY NINE ALL S. E. R. A.'S EXCEED THESE ALREADY HIGH STANDARDS. THIS LEGISLATION YOU SERVICE PARKS DECISION MAKING A DECISION MAKING AND MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY GOVERNOR NEWSOM MADE THIS OBSERVATION IS TO TWENTY NINETEEN VETO OF AB TEN EIGHTY SIX. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SCIENCE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FACTS ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE CHECKED IN THE STATE PARKS COLUMN. IT IS ABOUT DESPAIN DISDAIN FOR THOSE WHO ENJOYING NATURE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN OTHERS. RECREATION SHOULD AND COULD BE NONPARTISAN IF YOU ARE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES CHOSE SIMPLY TO SUPPORT OUR STATE PARK. BY THE WAY THIS OFF ROADER IS A DEMOCRAT. SENATOR GLAZERS. IN ADDITION TO THE FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY OF TRANSFERRING NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM STATE COFFERS INTO THE O. H. P. FUN TO DO WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS DESIGNED FOR WEALTHY POLITICALLY CONNECTED ENTITIES. SEEK TO DENY ACCESS TO REGULAR CITIZENS THEY DEEM UNWORTHY.

MISTER JONES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER GLAZIER AND- YOU MAY HAVE COVERED THIS IN YOUR OPENING ON HOLIDAYS IF YOU DID THAT I MISSED IT BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S- BY VETO MESSAGE. LAST YEAR AND- I'LL JUST READ THE FINAL PARAGRAPH THERE'S BEEN IT'S A SHORT MESSAGE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS FAILED TO CONDUCT SUFFICIENT STUDY OF THIS PROPERTY OR IS MISMANAGING THIS STATE RESOURCE THE PARK WAS PURCHASED FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND SHOULD REMAIN A STATE PARK SO THAT RAISES THE CONCERN OF YOU KNOW WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS BILL FROM THE BILL LAST YEAR. THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER VIOLENCE I THINK THAT IT SHOWS A MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE IS STILL WHAT. WE'RE PROPOSING ARE PROPOSING THAT IT BE A STATE PARK THAT IT BE A PUBLIC. A PRESERVATION AREA AND I THINK THAT WAS INTO. CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD IN REGARD TO- THAT THE ACTIONS HE TOOK ON THE BILL. WHAT IS WAS THAT- YEAH YEAH I REMEMBER THAT BEING FOR THE CONVERSATION LAST YEAR THAT IT. IS WAS THAT A NEW REQUIREMENT THAT IT GOES TO A NONPROFIT. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE ADDED INTO THIS BILL IS A- AN ACTUAL PAYMENT. FOR CONSERVATION OF IT SO THAT IT BE ALLOWED TO BE PUT IN CONSERVATION- PURPOSES THAT'S THAT'S IN THE BILL- AS A% ELEMENT OF THE BILL PREVIOUSLY- THE BILL I GAVE THE STATE DEPARTMENT. OF PARKS AND REC THE OPTION. OF- OF SELLING THE PROPERTY AND DO A CLEARED UP THIS BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THERE SHALL BE A SALE IF THESE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ARE PROVIDED AND IT WOULD GO INTO PERMANENT PUBLIC PRESERVATION. ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS- I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO LOOK UP THE USAGE OF THE PARKER DID. FIND THE MAP OF IT AND- AS A MATTER OF FACT I I'M I'M DISAPPOINTED A LITTLE BIT AYE. I DID A MOTORCYCLE TOUR- IN DECEMBER AS PART OF OUR SWEARING IN CEREMONIES I RODE MY MOTORCYCLE UP FROM SAN DIEGO THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS AND THEN BACK TO THE COAST. AND I JUST MISSED HI I WAS ON VASKO ROAD AND FIVE EIGHTY. AND IF I WOULD ON THIS IS COMING BACK I WOULD JUST DRIVE DOWN TO YOU KNOW COME SEE THE PARK AND ENTER IT- YOU KNOW I'VE GOT SOME AS WE ARE REYES IN MY AREA. OF COURSE ON CALIFORNIA'S GOT SOME FEDERAL ONES AS WELL. AND I AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONCERNS FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT- YOU KNOW THE CONSERVATION AND ALL THAT. WHICH IS IT IT'S A CONCERN STATEWIDE YOU KNOW CONSERVATION OF THE OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES- I JUST KIND OF I. YOU KNOW I I'M LOOKING AT THE MAP AND IT APPEARS TO BE KIND OF OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EXACTLY CHIU AND DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AS MUCH RESIDENTIAL AREA OR INDUSTRIAL. AREA AROUND THIS IS THAT ACCURATE. WELL IT SAID IN THE CITY OF LIVER. SO IT'S JUST OUTSIDE THE YOU KNOW THE TYPICAL. CITY CENTER OKAY. URGENT MEASURES IT I WAS READING THE MAP REYES BECAUSE AT THIS AT THIS PROPERTY BORDERS IN EXISTING- HV PROPERTY THAT IS BEING USED FOR- H. B. USE AND NOTHING IN THIS BILL AFFECTS. THE EXISTING L. H. B. USED F. AT THE CARNEGIE SITE IT'S REALLY ONLY ABOUT THE EXPANSION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRICTLY MAKING ABOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE- ACTIVITIES I ON THAT WELL IT IS GOOD THAT WE'RE NOT PROPOSING BUILDING A MUCH HOUSES NEXT TO IT SO THAT'S YOU KNOW. TEN TO THE CURRENT USE OF THAT THAT'S GOOD WELL THERE'S SOME CONCERNS YOU KNOW US JANA. DUNES IS- IT'S CLOSER BEING FOR. BIG I'M SURE THERE'LL BE SOME. IN LAWSUITS AROUND THAT YOU KNOW THOSE IF THAT DOES STAY CLOSED YOU KNOW THE FOLKS THAT ARE USED TO USE KNOWS HOW TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO. YOU KNOW FIND A NEW PLACE TO RECTORY- THIS IS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS TO BE. AN OFF ROAD PARK- BACK TO THE CONSERVATION NO. YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE CROWN JEWELS OF THE CALIFORNIA PARK SYSTEM ARE THESE S. VRES- BECAUSE WE FILE WE- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN THE OPERA COMMUNITY FOR A LONG TIME AND I REMEMBER. YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN A LOT OF THESE WERE BEING PROPOSED THERE WAS A LOT OF RESISTANCE FROM THE OFF ROADERS BECAUSE- IT YOU KNOW- THEY WERE BEING YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM CRAWLED INTO A SMALLER LOCATION AND- THEY WERE REALLY CONCERNED THAT. AND THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE CONCERNED THAT. WE WERE GOING TO THE PLACES THAT WERE BEING RESERVED FOR OFF ROAD USE WE'RE GOING TO BE DESTROYED. BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY OF THE USE. AND I THINK THAT WAS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN AT THE TIME BUT I THINK WE'VE PROVEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. OF THE OPERA COMMUNITY WORKING TOGETHER WITH PARKS AND THE CONSERVATION GROUPS. THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO. HAVE THIS OFF HIGHWAY AND I'LL ADMIT INSTANCE USE. BUT THE WAY THAT. THE YOU THE PEOPLE USING THE PROPERTY ARE WORKING WITH THE LAND MANAGERS TO. MAINTAINING CONTROL THE TRAILS AND PUT THEM IN SPECIFIC AREAS AND AVOID. THE NATIONAL RESOURCES AND ALSO THE SPEAKER WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKERS MENTIONED THE NATIVE AMERICAN RESOURCES THAT ARE PROTECTED- I THINK THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB AND- I HAVEN'T BEEN INTO YOUR AYE TOUR DR TEO- WELL AS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO- BUT OTHER THAN THAT I. HAVEN'T BEEN IN ONE IN A WHILE SO I'M I'M LOOKING FOR TO COME UP AND DURING THIS ONE BUT UNFORTUNATELY TODAY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL I. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PRESIDENT THAT THE THAT THIS BILL THAT THIS. IS A STATE PARK IT'S A STATE AS WE ARE A AND THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD BE THANK YOU SIR. I'M GOING TO. RECOGNIZE MYSELF TO SPEAK TO THIS BILL. AND I'VE HAD A LONG INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS ISSUE. OF BOTH AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER KNOWN FOR EIGHT YEARS AS THE RESOURCES SECRETARY WHICH HAD STATE PARKS AND- AND THERE HAS BEEN AS EITHER. SENATOR GLAZER SAID OR THE- BUT NOW ALSO SAID THIS IS BEEN GOING FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I CAN REMEMBER AT LEAST TEN OR TWELVE OF THEM. AND THERE BEEN MANY PROPOSALS FROM SUCCESS OF LEGISLATORS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT ACTUALLY SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSES THE UNDERLYING PROCEDURAL ISSUE WHICH IS SAID IF THIS IS GOING TO BE CONSERVED. AND A NON- H. FI FASHION. THEN CASH HAS TO GO TO BUY OUT THE PRO H. P. FUND TO DO IT AND THE PREVIOUS BILLS. DID NOT DO THAT DID NOT ADDRESS THAT THEY WANT TO GIVE STATE PARKS THE OPTION TO FLIP IT. THEY WANTED ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME ADDRESSES THE UNDERLYING PROCEDURAL ISSUE. NOW ARE OF COURSE THANK THAT. HAVING WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY BEEN LOBBIED BY BOTH SIDES EXTENSIVELY. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR A PARK AND LAND CONSERVATION AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THE KEY THING IS THAT SENATOR GLAZER HAS DDRESSED THIS IN THE CORRECT FASHION IF THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED TO CONSERVE THE LAND AND SO- AND THAT IS WHY IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE PREVIOUS ONES BECAUSE ALL THE PREVIOUS ONES. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO LEAD TO THE CONSERVATION OF THE LAND WITHOUT PAYING BACK THE O. H. P. FONT THIS BILL ADDRESSES TO. SO AND THEN IF THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THERE'S THE MONEY THERE TO ADDRESS THE OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES SO. I'M GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE. SUPPORTING THIS BILL TO. ARE THERE ANY OTHER KIND OR- IS THERE MOTION. BY THE BILL WAS MOVED BY SENATOR HOLLAND- EXCUSE ME LET ME GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO CLOSE THANK YOU CHAIR LAYERED IN THE ME MENTION I HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER THAT TO ENJOY THIS ACTIVITY I ALSO HAVE MANY CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT AND ENJOY THIS ACTIVITY AND THEY DO SO RIGHT NOW AT THE CARNEGIE SITE- AND THAT BASED ON STATE PARKS DATA. SAID THE USE IS GOING DOWN AT THAT SITE JUST BUT IT'S A PLACE I'VE BEEN OUT TO SEE IN A LOT OF MY TO MY CONSTITUENCY ENJOYS IT AND THIS BILL WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT EXISTING- ACTIVITY I WOULD SAY THIS TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SUPPORTIVE OF OFF HIGHWAY THIS ISN'T THE BILL FOR YOU BECAUSE THIS WILL GET THE MONEY BACK AND WE'LL FIND THAT CAN GO LOOK FOR PLACES THAT ARE MORE CHEAPER BOLAND. AND I ARE BETTER PLACES FOR THIS ACTIVITY THINK ABOUT IT THAT TWENTY NOTED THAT THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN IT AT THAT TO ACQUIRE THOSE THESE EXISTING PROPERTIES ADJACENT PROPERTIES IT'S JUT SAT THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS IT'S BEEN A LITIGATION LITIGATION LITIGATION. I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER GOING TO CHANGE AND SO THIS BILL GETS GETS MONEY BACK INTO THAT FINE AND THEY CAN LOOK FOR PLACES ELSEWHERE TO OFFER THAT ACTIVITY GO WITH A PLAN THAT WOULD BE- AS ECOLOGICALLY SPECIAL IS THE LAND THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY AND WITH THAT I THINK THIS IS A WIN WIN BILL AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM FOURTEEN S. B. S. NINE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS LAYERED HI. ALL RIGHT JONES. JONES NO ALLEN. ALLEN ALL RIGHT EGGMAN. GROVE HERTZBERG. HUESO LOAN. STERN. YOUR NINE AND SENATOR STERN SINCE WE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU BEFORE WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL US WHICH DISTRICT A PERSON IS WITH COUNTY. DIRECTOR JEREMY WHAT'S- GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEBTS OF RECOGNIZED STERN ON SO THAT'S THREE ICE ONE NO WILL PUT THE MEASURE ON CALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT TO THE GRACIOUSNESS ALLOWED ME TO SAFE TRAVELS AND- THANK SHOT. WE'RE EXCUSE ME. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE. SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY SIX UNDER STERN HE'S HERE TOO TO PRESENT REMOTELY AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT- WE ONLY. WE HAVE FOUR BILLS AFTER THIS AND- SENATOR CAP A YEAR- YOU'RE GOING TO BE NEXT UP AFTER SENATOR STERN PRESENTS THIS BILL SENATOR STERN- WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUNG ONES WORK KEEPING OUR AD ORDER BUSINESS MOVING- AND GETTING THROUGH ALL THESE IMPORTANT BILLS TODAY- SB THREE SEVENTY SIX IS. A RE VISITATION OF AN ISSUE- THE BILL THAT DIED- THAT NOT EVEN THE ELEVENTH HOUR BUT THE ELEVENTH AND A HALF HOUR OF SESSION. LAST YEAR BUT WE'VE REALLY REFINED OUR APPROACH LAST YEAR WE WERE WE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CONCERNED ABOUT- THE RISKS IN WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING- BOTH IN LIVE ANIMALS AS WELL AS IN TROPHIES IN ANIMAL PARTS- NOT JUST FOR- SOME OF THE BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY IS GOING ON OUT THERE BUT MOSTLY ABOUT THE RISK IS NOT A DISEASE. SPREAD IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE FINDINGS WE'VE DISCOVERED FOR COVIDIEN- PAST. FLUS IN OTHER MAJOR PANDEMICS WE'VE SEEN ORIGINATING FROM DO NOT ASK ORIGINS- THE BILL THIS YEAR- IS REFINED IT SEATS IT SQUARELY FOCUSED ON THAT ISSUE THE BILL IS NO LONGER- TOUCHING ON ON SOME OF THE- ISSUES AROUND TROPHIES IMPORTATION OF TROPHIES OR ANIMAL PARTS. ARE AT THIS POINT WE THINK THE NEW MINISTRATION THAT IS IN POSITION TO HANDLE SOME OF THOSE BROADER. CONSERVATION IN IMPORTATION CONCERNS- BUT THE BILL HERE TODAY IS SQUARELY FOCUSED ON- THE MOVEMENT TRAFFICKING IMPORTATION TRADE OF LIVE ANIMALS IN CALIFORNIA IN VARIOUS KINDS OF MARKET PLACES- AND WE THINK THAT. THIS MEASURE IS CRITICAL TO PREVENTING- THE NEXT PANDEMIC- THAT THAT THESE KIND OF PREVENTATIVE WORK HAVING A COORDINATED ENFORCEMENT ABILITY NOT JUST WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BUT- HOPEFULLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON INTERSTATE AND A FEDERAL BASIS WILL PREVENT US. FROM HAVING GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE CITY ONE CDS RANGER. YOU KNOW IT ENTIRE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH TO TRACK SOME OF THIS STUFF OR RELYING SIMPLY ON PAPER DATA BUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT- WERE ABLE TO STOP- BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY THAT COULD POSE A RISK TO HEALTH AND SAFETY. AS WELL AS STATES BIODIVERSITY- HOWEVER I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR- WE WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNED WITH THIS BILL THAT THINK IT'S IT MAY BE A PROXY FOR- REACHING INTO THE ACTIVITIES OF. ZOOS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BOTH ACA OR CA ZOOS- AND SOMEHOW TRYING TO. SHUT THEM DOWN OR CHANGE THEIR ACTIVITIES AND I WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD AND I KNOW WE'VE DONE THIS PRIVATELY BUT STATE PUBLICLY THAT IS REALLY NOT THE INTENTION OF THIS LEGISLATION. WE ARE LOOKING IN VERY NARROW IN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CDFW- WOULD PRO ACTIVELY SUSPEND THE ABILITY TO IMPORT. OR SELL OR TRADE CERTAIN ANIMALS IF AND ONLY IF. THERE IS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN A WRITTEN FINDING THAT SUGGESTS YOU NOT A TRANSMISSION FROM THAT SPECIES OR A CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES WITHIN THE SAME FAMILIES. COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A NOVEL AND NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED READILY TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE- WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- THERE THERE'S A DESIRE FOR A BIT MORE CLARITY ABOUT HOW CDFW WOULD ADMINISTER SUCH A STANDARD. WHETHER THEY BE REINVENTING THE WHOLE NEW PROCESS OR RELYING ON SOME OF THEIR EXISTING- PROCESS SEES AND I WANT TO COMMIT UP FRONT TO WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ENFORCEMENT DETAILS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS BILL KNOW EXACTLY. WHAT THEY'RE GETTING- AND A LOT OF HIS WORK THAT THE MAINSTREAM EITHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC ZOOS ARE. ALREADY DOING- SO I. THAT CLEARED HELPS GO FOR AND I WITH ME TODAY TO TOO- TESTED. IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE WE HAVE NICHOLAS SACKETT I WAS SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION AS WELL AS BRING INCOMING- FOR CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOOK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS WAS JUST INTRODUCED WE HAVE. TO READ SUPPORT WITNESSES THAT CAN- SHARE FOR UP TO FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN THEM THE FIRST ONE IS NICHOLAS SOCKET AND THEN JUDY MIGHT CAUSE SO MR SECOND WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CHAIR I AND I AM A READING THE STATEMENTS OF BURNING COMING FROM THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. THE INTERNATIONAL WILDLIFE TRADE IN ADDITION TO BEING ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE EXTINCTION CRISIS WITH THE LIKELY ORIGIN OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS CONFIRMED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION EARLIER THIS MONTH BECAUSE OF THE NINETEEN LIKELY ORIGINATED IN A BAT MADE THE JUMP TO ANOTHER SPECIES AND FROM THERE TO HUMANS. THIS TRANSMISSION CHAIN LIKELY OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRADING EITHER WILD CAUGHT OR FARMED WILDLIFE. AND THE FIRST LARGE OUTBREAK OF THE DISEASE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LIVE ANIMAL MARKETS GLOBALLY ABOUT ARE CONSIDERED SYNODIC MEANING THEY JUMPED FROM OTHER ANIMALS TO PEOPLE AND MORE THAN 70% OF THE UNITED TO DO THIS. ORIGINATE WITH WILDLIFE. SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THE MAJORITY OF ALL FUTURE EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES WILL COME FROM WILDLIFE. THE COSBY NINETEEN OUTBREAK HAS LED NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING ELEMENTS OF THE U. N. AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION TO CALL FOR BANS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE LIVE WILDLIFE TRADE. AND LOCAL WOULD ARRIVE HERE VIA HUMAN TRANSMISSION THE VIRUS HAS REPEATEDLY JUMPED BETWEEN PEOPLE AND CAPTIVE WILDLIFE. THIS HAS OCCURRED AND MEAN FARMS IN OREGON SUCH HUMAN ANIMAL TRANSMISSION EVEN THREATENED BOTH PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE AND COULD LEAD TO THE OUTBREAK OF NEW AND POTENTIALLY MORE DANGEROUS VARIANTS OF THE DISEASE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PRODUCE EXOTIC DISEASE RISK REQUIRE THAT AN IMPORTER OR SELLER OF WILDLIFE MUST FIRST DEMONSTRATE THAT A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LIVE ANIMAL. IS NOT A DISEASE OR IF THE PEOPLE. OR OUR NATIVE WILDLIFE BEFORE CAN COME INTO OR BE SOLD IN THE STATE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE THE NECESSARY APPROACH WE ORDER PASSAGE OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ENRICHMENT. CRUSOE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. HI I'M JUDY MAN CREWS FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION CO SPONSORED THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME INACCURACIES ABOUT WHAT SB THREE SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOESN'T DO YOU WILL HEAR THAT THE BILL UNFAIRLY TREATED. DIFFERENTLY BASED ON WHETHER THEY ARE ACCREDITED BY AZ A ARE THE COMPETING B. A. A. IT DOES NOT EXISTING ON CALIFORNIA. AND IN OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL ALREADY EXAM ACA ACCREDITED ZOOS FROM CERTAIN PERMIT REQUIREMENTS. THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT NEWS LIKE THE ONE YOU WILL HEAR FROM THAT CHOOSE NOT TO MEET THE HIRE A VA STANDARDS. HAVE LATCHED ON TO THIS BILL IN AN EFFORT TO LOWER CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS APPROPRIATE BUT IN ANY CASE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE A BLANKET PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF RESTRICTED SPECIES ARE EVEN KNOWS SPECIES THAT POSTED THE THREAT. WHERE THERE ARE BROKER TO CALLS FOR ROBUST HAS SEEN AFFECTED TREATMENT ARE QUARANTINE THE DEPARTMENT MAY ALLOW PERMITS EVEN. TO NON AGA. THE VILLAGE PRUDENT MEASURED RESPONSE TO PUT HELLO PORTER AND DO NOT A DISEASE. AND ARE WILD FROM IN SPECIES. WE HOPE THAT PAST YEAR HASDONE. THE VALUE AND AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION WHEN PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM DO NOT EXPEL- BURKE WE DID NOT ASK OUR OVER TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS AND HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. EIGHT TWO RESPECT THE COMMITTEES CAUGHT OFF. THEIR SUPPORT IS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS. WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU YOU MIGHT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BURKE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE ONE WAIT OPPOSITION WITNESS CHARLIE SAM IT FROM THOSE WHO A LOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND THE MONTEREY ZOO A LOGICAL SOCIETY WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CHAIRING COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHARLIE SENATE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MY RESUME AND HE A. AS CURRENTLY AUTHORED. SB THREE SEVENTY SIX WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON A SELECT GROUP OF SEROLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVICE. CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WILL NO DOUBT BE USED TO SHUT DOWN THE IMPORTANT. IMPORTATION OF THE VITAL ANIMALS NECESSARY. QUICK AND EASY TO SURVIVE IN THIS NEW INDUSTRY. OUR THREE MAIN CONCERNS START WITH REDUNDANCY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH SECTION OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH ALREADY HAVE ANIMALS. AND THE PROTOCOL. THAT THEY PREVENT BLUES FROM BRINGING IN WITHOUT DOING SPECIFIC TESTING. WE ARE READY TO HEAR TO THAT. NEXT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE EXEMPTIONS FOR ALL OF THIS IS A THIS AMENDED LANGUAGE CURRENTLY ALL ORGANIZATIONS ARE HELL TO RESTRICTIONS REGARDING THE IMPORT OF DETRIMENTAL SPECIES. IF THIS BILL. IS TO ADDRESS THE OBVIOUS NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED CONCERN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY THREAT WE CONTINUE TO ASK WHY ANY ORGANISATION IMPORTING ANIMALS IN THE STATE WOULD BE EXEMPT. YES EXISTING LAWS DO CURRENTLY EXEMPT ONE YOU'LL HAVE TO CALL TRADE ORGANIZATION FROM CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CURRENT REGULATIONS. BUT NOT FOR MATTERS HAVING TO DO WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS. HENCE THE EXISTING DETRIMENTAL SPECIES LANGUAGE. WE'VE RAISED A QUESTION REGARDING WHAT LIST THE ANIMALS DESCRIBED IN THIS LOOKS LEGISLATION WILL BE PLACED ON AND THAT QUESTION HAS YET TO BE ANSWERED. IF THEY'RE ON AN EXISTING DETRIMENTAL SPECIES LIST. ALL WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE RESTRICTIONS AS PROBABLY SHOULD BE. IF THEY'RE PLACED ON A NEW LIST THEN ONE ZERO LOGICAL TRADE ORGANIZATION IS EXEMPT FROM THE PROTECTIONIST LEGISLATION CLAIMS TO OFFER CALIFORNIANS. IT WOULD PROTECT CERTAIN JEWS FROM WHAT THREATENS ALL THE OTHER ISSUES IN THIS BILL EVEN THOUGH THERE'S- A SCIENTIFIC PROOF THAT COLBERT SPREAD FROM HUMAN TO ANIMAL IS NOT PREVENTABLE BY ANY IS A LOGICAL ORGANIZATION. THIS MORNING I TRIED TO GET ALL OF YOU A DOCUMENT SUPPORTING THE CDC AND THE USDA RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDED CAPTIVE WILDLIFE GUIDANCE PROTOCOLS THAT WAS RELEASED THIS MORNING. THEY DO NOT EXEMPT ANY IS- A CURRENT FEDERAL BILL MOVING THROUGH CONGRESS TODAY HR ONE FIFTY ONE WITH NINETY TWO CO SPONSORS TWENTY FROM CALIFORNIA. AND SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE D. A. N. A. Z. A. CLEARLY AIMED AT THE STOPPING OF THIS DISEASE BEFORE THEY ENTER THE COUNTRY AND AGAIN OFFERS NO EXEMPTION FOR EITHER ORGANIZATION. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE RELATIVE TO SCIENCE THAT ALLOWS FOR ANYONE TO RECEIVE AN EXEMPTION FROM KOBE PROTOCOLS AND INTRUDES. THERE'S AN OBVIOUS IN SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF THE OPPOSITE. IN THIS CHAPTER IN THIS LAW WAS WRITTEN. THERE WAS AN EXEMPTION GIVEN TO ONE OF TRADE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT EXISTED. NOW THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE TRADE ORGANIZATION CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS TESTIMONIES USE THAT USED TO BE A OVER AGA DO NOT DO SO TO ESCAPE PROPER PROTOCOLS FOR OUR ANIMALS. WHEN WRAPPING UP. WE CONTINUE TO ASK SENATORS DURING TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT A NEW AND ESTABLISHED TRADE ORGANIZATION. IS IN EXISTENCE BUT WASN'T A FACTOR WHEN THE OTHER TRADE ORGANIZATION WAS PROVIDED IT'S EXEMPTION BECAUSE OF ITS HIGHER STANDARDS THAN THE STATE. C. A. A.'S STANDARDS CLEARLY DO THE EXACT SAME THING THEY EXCEED THE MINIMUM STANDARDS OF THE STATE. OUR REQUESTED AMENDMENTS- YOU'RE YOU'RE AT FOUR MINUTES WILL COULD YOU PLEASE WRAP UP OKAY. YES SIR OUR REQUESTED AMENDMENTS WILL PROTECT THE SIX ISSUES OF THE TWENTY NINE ACCREDITED ZOOS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOW WE WILL MOVE TO.

I GUESS THE POSITIVE SERENDIPITOUS THINGS THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH LAST YEAR'S BILL IS. LIES HOW MANY ANIMAL SANCTUARIES I HAD IN MY DISTRICT I MEAN YOU KNOW I'M FROM SAN DIEGO AT THE WORLD FAMOUS SAN DIEGO ZOO IN THE- WORLD FAMOUS SENDING A WILD ANIMAL PARK WHICH THEY CALL SAFARI PARK NOW BUT I LIVE IN SENDING A LONG ENOUGH TO KEEP CALM AT THE WILD ANIMAL PARK- AND- WELL I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO LAST YEAR BEING ABLE TO SET UP. A TOURISM. AND I THINK IT WAS HALF A DOZEN- OF. THEM PLACES IN MY DISTRICT THAT- MR STERN FOUND FOR ME SO I WAS THANKFUL FOR THAT INCLUDING A CAMEL DAIRY WHICH PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE ME THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY CAMEL DAIRY- BUT THAT'S NOT FOR DRINKING IT SO THEY MAKE A HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS OUT OF THE- THE MILK- THAT THE COWS. GIVE THEM- THAT THE CAMEL CAL'S GIVE THEM SO- I ALSO WANT TO THANK MR STERN HE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS LAST WEEK FOR- A GRACIOUS PERIOD OF TIME. I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE BILL TODAY- IN HOPES THAT WE CAN FIND- COMMON GROUND ON WHERE TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT TO MY CONSTITUENTS ARE PROTECTED. BUT I DID WANT TO PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE IT HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS WITH THEM AND. AND WE HAD A VERY POSITIVE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR STERN AYE MINUTE M. ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS M. AS THEIR THAN NOT SAN DIEGO BIT AT BAKERSFIELD HAS ONLY ONCE YOU.

EIGHT GROUP. AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT AND THAT YESTERDAY AND SO I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE- ALTHOUGH IT'S A VERY VERY SMALL THIS LITTLE ZERO IN OUR COMMUNITY DOES BRING A LOT OF PRIDE TO OUR DISTRICT AND THEN. IT HAS AMAZING EVENTS OUT THERE PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN AND HOPEFULLY SOON AND THEM. A LOT OF KIDS A LOT OF AT RISK KIDS A LOT OF SECOND SHE ANSWERS A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY GOES OUT AND DOES IT'S COMMON A CONTINUOUS BASIS INCLUDING. AND SCHOOLS THAT TAKE FIELD TRIPS OUT THERE SO. I'M HOPING THIS BILL WON'T TO STOP THEM FROM OPERATING. THANK YOU- CENTER GROVE AND THEN. ARE FOUND. BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION I WILL SAY A FEW WORDS IT AND I WOULD JUST SAY IT WAS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE THAT WAS TO LEAD A PERCENT TURN OPPOSITION AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO SENATOR STERN. I AM GOING TO IN A MOMENT MOVED THE BILL AND VOTE FOR BUT I THINK THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE FOR THE FIRST ISSUE IS DESERVES A DISAGREEMENT ON THE UNDERLYING FACTS NOT EVEN A DISAGREEMENT ON POLICY THERE STILL SOME DISAGREEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UNDERLYING FACTS OF THE SITUATION. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THOSE AND SEE IF WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION BASED ON AN AGREEMENT ON THE FACTS AND THEN GET AT THE DISAGREEMENTS AND I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THIS BILL SO ARE WILL MOVE THE BILL. AND I WILL RECOGNIZE. US SENATOR STERN TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU- TO BOTH SENATOR GROVE AND JONES FOR THEIR- ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND I LIKE THEM- HAVE MANY IMPORTANT SANCTUARY'S WILDLIFE RESCUE CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT FOR GIVEN REST EVERYTHING FROM GIVEN RESCUED TWO SEALS- TWO BIRD SANCTUARIES- AND THESE ARE REALLY CRUCIAL BACKBONE INSTITUTIONS THAT I I'D SHARE. THAT PRIDE IN- SO AS I MENTIONED THE OUTSET THE INTENT IS NOT TO. SHUT DOWN- THOSE SANCTUARIES OR EVEN TO REACH INTO THIS- UNDERLYING DISPUTE ABOUT COMPETING ACCREDITATION STANDARDS WHICH I HEARD YOU MAY HAVE HEARD A LITTLE BIT THERE ABOUT THE AZ EIGHT VERSES THE Z. EIGHT AND THE WAIVERS THAT ACA IS ABLE TO GET BUT NOT CA RIGHT NOW THROUGH CDFW- SOME OF-THOSE UNDERLYING EXIT ISSUES ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT PRIVATE TEAMS ARE ALLOWED TO DO AND WHAT YOU KNOW THESE. AND THESE OTHER YES REPUBLIC ZOOS ARE ALLOWED TO DO- WE'RE TRYING NOT TO LITIGATE THOSE ISSUES HERE WE REALIZE THERE ARE SOME TENSIONS AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS POPPING UP WE REALLY WANT TO STAY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THERE'S UNITED DISEASE RISK ISSUE AND TO THAT POINT I JUST WANTED FOR THE FOR YOUR PURPOSES OF SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THE EXEMPTION. THAT WAS- DISCUSSED BY THE LEAD OPPOSITION WE WENT THROUGH A PRETTY EXTENSIVELY ON ONE OF OUR CALLS BEEN TRYING TO DO AS MANY CALLS AS NECESSARY AND REALLY DOING IN HERE BUT THE V. TO BE CLEAR IF YOU ALL WANT TO GO INTO THE TEXAS ME FOR A QICK SECOND- THE AMENDMENTS THAT THIS BILL WOULD MAKE TO SECTION. TWENTY ONE FIFTY THE FISH AND GAME CODE. I IT'S ON- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THE SIX EIGHT PAGE OF YOUR OF THE- IN PRINT YOU GO DOWN TO PAY. NINE SO TWENTY ONE FIFTY HE- IS AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS MADE BY- WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE OVER THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR THAT WE'VE RETAINED HERE BUT THE SOUL- EXEMPTION THERE IS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS FOR A UNIVERSITY COLLEGE GOVERNMENT RESEARCH AGENCY OR OTHER BONAFIDE SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION CONDUCTING BONAFIDE MEDICAL OR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH- WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THAT EXEMPTION IS- YOU SPECIFIC. SIX OR SEVEN INSTITUTIONS LIKE UCSF UC RIVERSIDE I THINK STANFORD HAS AN INSTITUTION WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING DO NOT A DISEASE RESEARCH ON SPECIFIC ANIMALS IN THOSE LABS LIKE SQUARELY LOOKING AT EPIDEMIOLOGY RISK DOING ANALYSIS THERE WE DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE WAY THAT BONAFIDE MEDICAL RESEARCH BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT. EITHER YOU KNOW BIG SAN DIEGO ZOO ISRAEL IS DOING OR YOU KNOW A SMALL ZOO LIKE MONTEREY IS DOING NEITHER ONE OF THOSE WOULD FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY- THAT'S REALLY NOT THE INTENTION THERE NOT EVEN TEACHING ZOOS OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL KIND OF ZOOS YOU HAVE TO DO SPECIFICALLY. BONAFIDE MEDICAL RESEARCH THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF FEDERAL PERMITTING AND IT'S VERY HIGH RISK STUFF WITH YOU AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU TRY TO BRING IN BACKS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE THIS VIRUS IN THEM TO STUDY- THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF PROTOCOL SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SPACE FOR THAT SPECIFIC RESEARCH WHICH- ACTUALLY FURTHERS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL WHICH IS. TO REDUCING ARCTIC DISEASE RISK. AS TO THOSE SORT OF OVERLYING ISSUES OF THE TENSIONS BETWEEN- J. EASY A- WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO NOT SETTLE ALL THAT HERE- AND- BUT- WHAT I WILL COMMIT TO YOU IT IS WORKING TO GET VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF FACTS AND HOPEFULLY GET ON THE SAME PAGE EVEN WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO SO THAT THE NEXT TIME. YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON IT YOU FEEL- SQUARELY- FUHRMAN ON YOUR FOOTING IT FOR THE VOTE- BUT I THINK THAT THE FACTS CARE THEMSELVES OUT IN THE SECTION I JUST ARTICULATED- AS WELL AS- SOME OF THE TESTIMONY GIVEN HERE TODAY SO I WOULD SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE AND I WANTED YOU TO KNOW WITH THAT VOTE- COMES MY ON GOING COMMITMENT.

IT AND- SINCE OUR MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE RUSHING TO THE MICROPHONE I'M GOING TO RECOGNIZE MYSELF IT HAD. JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- I THINK THIS IS A GREAT DIRECTION. AND WHEN WE WERE IN THE DROUGHT FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN- I KNOW WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WE ACTUALLY ASSIGNED PEOPLE. ARE HARD TO REALLY TAKE ALL THE INCOMING THAT WAS COMING FROM DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT WAS ADHOC IT WAS DONE IN THE MOMENT BECAUSE- THE MOMENT REQUIRED NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS A BILL LIKE THIS THAT SET UP A PLACE TO DO IT AND- SO I THINK THIS IS A- VERY. ADMIRABLE AND A GOOD EFFORT. R. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT. I HAVE TO THINK THAT GIVEN THE DIRECTION. WE'RE GOING ON THE DRAFT RIGHT NOW. IF OF THE WILL BE A NEED FOR THIS MAYBE EVEN BEFORE THIS BILL CAN GET PASSED AND SIGNED WHETHER IT'S THE OFFICE OR OTHER THINGS AND- FOR CONSIDERING A DROP PACKAGE AT SOME POINT. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED A TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION PIECE OF IT. OUR TO CHANNEL SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO EMERGE AS THAT HAPPENS. AND THEN LASTLY- I DON'T KNOW THAT THE WATER COMMISSION IS THE BEST PLACE TO LOCATE THIS THE ANALYSIS POINTS THAT OUT AND THEN I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU. WORK AS THIS MOVES ALONG TO MAKE A DETERMINATION IF THAT IS BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE WHERE THERE'S SOME MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE. BUT SOME MEASURE OF LOGICAL PLACE TO ASSIGN OF THE BILL WITH THE SUBJECT. THE WATER COMMISSION IS REALLY. THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF THE WORK THAT THEY WERE SIGNED TO DO IN IN GETTING THE STORAGE MONEY OUT THE DOOR SO IN ANY EVENT- I'M GOING TO BE VERY PLEASED TO MOVE THIS VOTE TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONG. AND THERE ARE A FEW OF THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE TO WORK ON BUT THIS IS REALLY NEEDED AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS BILL AND THAT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED THIS.

ESCRIBIR OR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND- WE SHOULD WE SHOULD JUST TALK ABOUT WORK WHERE IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATELY- PLACED IF NOT THE WATER COMMISSION- HERE THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE PICKED THE WATER COMMISSION BEGIN WITH IS THERE INDEPENDENT THEY'VE- THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT- AT WATER ALL OVER THE STATE THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO USE GOOD SCIENCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND TO PARTNER WITH RECENT RESEARCHERS JUST GIVE SYSTEM AB. AN OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO WHAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP US TO USE WATERMARK MORE WISELY SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM SIX SB THREE FIFTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LAYERED BY. ALL RIGHT JONES. ALLEN EGGMAN. EGGMAN RA GROVE. GROVE HI HERTZBERG. HUESO MON. STERN WE HAVE THREE VOTES WE WILL PUT THAT THE LONG CALL. AND WE WILL MOVE TO. FILE ITEM SEVEN ALSO SENATOR CAFIERO S. B. THREE FIFTY NINE AND LET ME JUST SAY. THAT IF SENATOR DOLLY OR YOUR STAFF ARE LISTENING YOUR NEXT UP. CELLS START TO MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE HEARING ROOM- SENATOR CAFIERO YOU MAY PERCENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND OMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED 2% SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY NINE. I THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL WITH MY STAFF AND THE SPONSORS THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. SB THREE FIFTY NINE IS A PILOT PROGRAM THAT ENABLES MERCED COUNTY AND THE OWNERS OF A LOCAL NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO RECEIVE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INCENTIVES TO STEWARD THEIR LAND FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND MULTIPLE BENEFITS. CLICK THE CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. THROUGH STEWARDSHIP AND CONSERVATION CAN MAKE A MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS WHILE DELIVERING FOOD. AND FIBER AND OTHER CO BENEFITS SUCH AS HABITAT. AND EMPLOYMENT. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LANDOWNERS LIKE THOSE IN MERCED COUNTY NEED ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO DEPLOYED DECISION MAKING TOOLS. THAT INFORM REGIONAL CLIMATE STRATEGIES. AND LANDOWNER INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS SECTOR PARTICIPATION. THIS RESULT RESILIENT MERCED PILOT PROJECT. WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS THIS GAP. EXACTLY IT BUILD ON A READ MALL STAKEHOLDER F.% UNDERTAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND PARTNERS IN MERCED COUNTY TO DEVELOP A CLIMATE TOOL AND AN ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK. THAT ENABLES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LANDOWNERS TO CONSIST CONSISTENTLY ASSESS THE CLIMATE BENEFITS OF DIFFERENT LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ACROSS THE COUNTY. THIS INFORMATION AND ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK ENABLES THE COUNTY TO INTEGRATE SCENARIOS AND LATT LAND BASED ACTIVITIES INTO ITS CLIMATE AND LAND USE PLANS AND PROVIDES INFORMATION TO LANDOWNERS ON THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD ACHIEVE CLIMATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT BENEFITS IN THE COUNTY. THIS PILOT WOULD PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND VOLUNTARY INCENTIVES TO IMPLEMENT DIFFERENT LAN MENU MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ACROSS THE COUNTY THAT WOULD HELP ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE SUPPORTING POTENTIAL CO BENEFITS LIKE INCREASED SOIL WATER RETENTION. THIS PRODUCT PILOT PROGRAM COULD BE EXPANDED TO SAN DIEGO SONOMA AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES WHICH PARTICIPATED IN THE RESILIENT COUNTIES PROGRAM AT DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION WITH ALONG WITH MERCED COUNTY. SO THIS IS TRULY AN IMPORTANT PILOT PROJECT AND A BUILDING BLOCK BLOCK THAT SCALES FROM MERCED TO MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND POTENTIALLY TO A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. PROVIDING TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT IS MICHELLE PASSARO FROM THE NET THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR OF NETWORK TO MOVE.

FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THE BILL WHICH WAY TO SHE POINTS THAT WOULD ENABLE THE COUNTY MERCED AND LANDOWNERS AND ALL MY OTHER COUNTIES. TO GOT CLIMATE CHANGE BY PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE PLANET. THE RESOLVER SAID PILOT DOES BUILD ON COUNTY EFFORTS THAT WERE STARTED IN CINEMA ANDERSON COUNTY TO CHIEF SEVERAL IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES. INCLUDE ENGAGING BOTH COUNTIES AND LANDOWNERS IN NATURE BASED KIND OF STRATEGIES TO GROUPS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER LAND MANAGEMENT AND LAND USE ACROSS THE STATE. THAT YOU CAN GREATER CRIME IMPACT AT SCALE BY TAKING A REGIONAL OR COUNTY SCALE APPROACH TO PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT IT WOULD DO THIS BY PROVIDING LANDOWNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE TOOLS THE PLAN INTEGRATE AND IMPLEMENT MAJOR BASED STRATEGIES AS PART OF CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. WITH THAT IN THE STATE UP WHEN THEY COUNTY GRAMMAR TO CONSISTENTLY TRACK CLIMATE RELATED BENEFITS OVER TIME. IN A MANNER THAT ALSO MINIMIZES THE BURDEN ON LANDOWNERS. AND BUILD ON EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS AND FRAMEWORKS MUCH OF THIS WORK HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN MERCED COUNTY THROUGH THE TWO YEAR DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION ACROSS THE US. CENTER JUST REFERENCE THANK WOULD INPUT FROM LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND STATE AGENCIES. BUT WHAT IS MISSING NOW IS THE FOLLOW THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT YOUR SAID COUNTY MORE FULLY INTEGRATE DIFFERENT LAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES IF YOU I'M ACTION PLAN. AND INTENDED TO LANDOWNERS YOU'RE WILLING TO IMPLEMENT SUCH ACTIVITIES. MANY COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA- ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING TO UNDERTAKE SIMILAR EFFORTS INCLUDING SANTA BARBARA SAN DIEGO. VENTURE AT THE MCKALE. POSTED NEEDED JUST NAME A FEW. POLITIKER BY THE NEW TO FOLLOW PERMITS THAT CAN AND PLAN.

MISTER CHAIRPERSON WITH NOBODY ELSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE MATTER BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND I'M KIND OF OPEN. THE COMMENTS AGAIN. AND I REALLY APPRECIATED THE CHANCE TO- TO- HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT THIS I WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE CREATION OF THE SOCK PROGRAM WHICH STANDS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL LANDS CONSERVATION PROGRAM DON'T HAVE TO PUT THE DOLLAR IN THE JAR FOR THE ACRONYM IN THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION- AND WHAT WAS IMPORTANT. IS WHEN THE WILLIAMSON AXES TO BE. FUNDED ARE ADEQUATELY AT THE STATE LEVEL AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION THIS PROGRAM STEPPED UP. TO FUND OUR CONSERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND IN SOME CASES PLANNING. AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS AT A POINT OF- IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GAS REDUCTION FUNDS OF FORTY MILLION A YEAR ITS OVER SUBSCRIBED PEOPLE REALLY WANT THIS. AND SO I SALUTE YOU FOR DOING THIS BILL WHICH I THINK IS IN TWO PARTS IT REALLY. PRIORITIZES MERCED COUNTY IT REALLY HELPS WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT ALSO HELPS WITH THE GRANTS I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING WOULD BE. THAT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE EVERY COUNTY IS ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO POUR PRIORITIZE ONE COUNTY AND- IT AND PRIORITIZING ONE COUNTY OVER OTHERS MAKES ME TWIKI IN AN OVERSUBSCRIBED FUND. BUT I THINK THAT IT IS ADMIRABLE AND IT REALLY DOES TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND I THINK YOU'RE REALLY DESIGNED TO BRING PEOPLE IN SUPPORT IN MERCED COUNTY. THIS IS A GOOD THING I'M GOING TO VOTE TO MOVE ON THE BILL. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OR OR GOD FORBID A MOTION. I NEED TO THIS BILL FROM BY AGREEMENT FURTHER. SAN CAFIERO YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE HISTORICAL- AB INFORMATION AS SOCK HAS TURNED INTO A GREAT IT'S REALLY A GREAT PROGRAM- YOU KNOW FARMERS ARE GREAT STEWARDS OF THE LAND AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS FARM AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO- INVEST IN THE PRACTICES THAT'LL CHANGE. HOW THEY DO BUSINESS- AND MAKE IT EASY SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT WILL RESET RESULT IN THE BEST- THE BEST. LAND MANAGEMENT CLIMATE CHANGE- IMPACT. THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE THEY THEY WANT TO PRODUCE A GOOD PRODUCT IF WE CAN DO IT AND HELP THEM TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT ALSO BENEFITS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECT THE RURAL WAY OF LIFE THEN I THINK THAT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

ACRE STATS FOUR POINT TWO MILLION PLUS WHATEVER THE MATH WORKS OUT TO MOCK SQUARE MILES OF LAND IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED CAN IT ALSO IMPACTS TO HABITAT NO IN THE WILDLIFE THAT'S IN THOSE AREAS SO THIS BILL WOULD CAPTURE THE BASELINE INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE IMPACT OF WILDFIRE TO OUR HABITAT AND WILDLIFE SO THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS BILL- HUNTING AND FISHING PERMITS ARE BASED ON SCIENTIFIC DATA. WELL WE DON'T ACTUALLY A CAPTURE THIS INFORMATION TO KNOW THE TRUE IMPACTS ABOUT pINVASIVE SPECIES ARE TWO EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES THAT WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THROUGH THE CAPTURE OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND BIODIVERSITY- I HAVE SUBMITTED ALSO I WANTED THE COMMITTEE TO NOTE I HAVE SUBMITTED A BUDGET REQUEST AND FUNDS TO STUDY.

THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION BY EGGMAN TO HAVE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL. SENATOR DOLLY YOU MAY CLOSE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. I DO HAVE OPPOSITION AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE- IT'S A SIERRA CLUB OPPOSED TO. BASICALLY THE SEMANTICS OF HOW WE GET WHERE WE'RE GOING SO I'M IN ADDRESS THEIR ISSUE THEY BRING UP- ABOUT THE LOCALS PARTICIPATION IN. AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO- HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS SO I'M COUNTRY TRYING TO NARROW DOWN FOR MAYBE GOT TO LOOK AT. COUNTY ARE NOT TO RESOURCE DEPARTMENTS TO ENGAGE WITH US ON. IN IN THIS PROJECT GOING FORWARD AND THE DATA THAT WE GATHER- WILL BE CRITICAL NOT ONLY- IS IT IS THIS IS THIS IS ALL CRAWL CROSS SECTION OF ALL LANDS. AND YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. REPRESENTS 60% OF OUR LAND BASE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THEY NEED TO BE A PARTNER WITH US IN MANY AREAS. IN OTHER CARBON RELEASE FROM FIRE ALSO THE HABITAT IN THE- THE INVASIVE SPECIES IN THE WILD LIFE AS WELL SO FOR THAT FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MORE YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM ELEVEN SB FIVE NINE TO THE MOTION IS DUE PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS LAYERED BY THIRD ALL RIGHT JONES JONES AYE ALLEN. EGGMAN EGGMAN RA GROVE GROVE HI HERTZBERG HUESO MON. SENATOR LIMON SB FIVE NINE TWO AYE MON AYE STERN. WE HAVE FIVE VOTES WHICH IS ENOUGH ABSENT ANYTHING ELSE BUT WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BILL ON CALL AND APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY. OKAY WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO THE LAST BILL THE LAST BILLS. SB FOUR SEVEN ZERO FROM JONES SO ALERT ALERT ALERT FOR ARE WE WILL BE LIFTING CALLS AND YOU WILL BE STANDING BETWEEN US IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE STATE. SO WE'RE ON OUR LAST BILL ASK MEMBERS TO GET READY TO RETURN TO THE HEARING ROOM FOR THE LIFTING OF CALLS- MISTER JONES SB FOUR SEVEN ZERO WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLE FOR SEVENTY CREATES A COMBINATION OF HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE WHICH WILL BE VALID FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSES TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY HOWEVER. MANY OTHER STATES INCLUDING NEIGHBORING STATES OF OREGON ARIZONA AND NAT NEVADA OFFER ANNUAL COMBINATION LICENSES THESE LICENSES ARE PROVING POPULAR. AS MANY SPORTSMEN BOTH HUNT AND FISH ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS BEFORE SEVENTY WILL BRING THIS COMBINATION LICENSING AS AN OPTION TO SPORTSMEN AND SPORTSWOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND BY ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE TO BOTH HUNT AND FISH THE COMBINATION LICENSE WILL SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND REACTIVATION EFFORTS. I THINK WAS PUT TOGETHER UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP AT SOME POINT TIME. AND SEWER- LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THAT I BELIEVE I HAVE A KEY WITNESS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET ON THE MAIN ON THE WITNESS SCIENCE I THINK THEY'RE ON THE MAIN LINE- FRAZIER CALLING UP WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IT HERE FOR WE AND I UNDERSTAND CHAIR THE THERE'S A MAN THAT- I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT IN INCLUDING THE BILL. THEN LET ME FIRST ASK- THE TWO WITNESSES IN THE ONE IS MORE KENNELLY FROM CALIFORNIA WATERFALL IS THINKS NOT ON THE RIGHT LINE MARKEDLY I BELIEVE IS ON THE TRACK LINE MARK SMITH IS ON THE MAIN LINE. OKAY THEN LET'S GO TO MARK HENLEY WELCOME TO THE M. BETWEEN THE TWO MARKS THEY HAVE UP TO FOUR MINUTES SO LET'S GO TO MARK TENALLY. HI MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATER PROBLEM HM YOU GUYS HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE OR KEEP GOING. GREAT THANK YOU OUR CURRENT HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE SYSTEM OUTDATED AND NEEDS TO BE FULLY INTEGRATED IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- WITH OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA OFFERS RELATIVELY Q. TYPES OF HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSES. AND ONLY A HANDFUL OF CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO OUR LICENSING SYSTEM IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS- JONES MENTIONED AT YOU FOR SEVENTY WOULD NOT ONLY CREATE A NEW COMBINATION HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE THAT WOULD ALSO. ALLOW THE LIGHT TO BE BALLOT BOX FROM THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS. FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. THIS IS A CHANGE WHICH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED. THIS WOULD FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF LIFE INSPIRED MOST EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE LIGHT. AS WAS ALSO UPON ABOUT FORTY OTHER STATES HAVE THESE LICENSES COMBINATION MIGHT THE- INCLUDING. NEIGHBORING OREGON NEVADA AND ARIZONA. YOU KNOW STATE THAT. HAVE ADOPTED THE COMBINATION LICENSE THAT SEEKS TO OFFER IT SO THEY BALK AT GOING WITH THIS- CALIFORNIA HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE SALES WHICH TOTALED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AB DECLINE FOR DECADES MANY OF YOU KNOW DESPITE THE RECENT UPTICK IN REVENUES DURING THE COAT AND DEMOCRATS. THIS DECLINE NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE STRUCTURAL RUBBER REVENUE AND BALANCE ON FACED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IT HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES PONDERED THROUGH THESE LICENSES. DURING THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE HUNTING AND FISHING RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND REACTIVATION PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS. STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT FOCUSED ON LICENSING THE CIVICALLY RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF A COMBINATION HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NATIONAL STUDY ALSO ASKED STATE WILDLIFE PROFESSIONALS. SUGGEST AN ATTACHED BACKERS. IT MIGHT HAVE BY AFFECTED LIGHTNING FAILED IN THEIR STATE. THE STUDY FOUND THAT AN IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT INCREASED LIGHT LICENSE SALES IS CHANGING TYPES OF WHITE LICENSES THAT IS THE CREATION OF NEW LICENCES. BY OFFERING GREATER CONSUMER CHOICE AND FLEXIBILITY AS YOU FOR SEVENTY WOULD HELP TO INCREASE FUNDING AND FISHING LICENSE SALES AND THE CONSERVATION BENEFITS THAT THEY PROVIDE. WE RESPECTFULLY. URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE'RE GOING PICK UP SMITH SECOND ONE WHEN WE GET TO. OF THE TO THE OUR PHONE LINE BUT SHE THE- WITH LOCUSTS JUST USED UP A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE FOUR MINUTES MISTER SMITH WHEN WE GET TO YOU JUST BE CONSCIOUS OF THAT. NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO- HE'S NOW IN THE PUBLIC ON OKAY THEN WILL WELCOME MARK SMITH OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GUIDES AND SPORT SPORTSMEN'S ASSOCIATION WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU HEAR ME OK WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE. CORRECT AND I WILL USE ARMENIAN MY TIME AT THE PARK AND LEAVE DID A GREAT JOB- THE ONLY THING I'LL ADD IS THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THOSE ARE THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS. IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO HELP UPDATE AND MODERNIZE THE LICENSING STRUCTURE SO FOR THIS BILL. AND OTHER BUILDING WILL TALK ABOUT. RUBIO IN MODERN LIFE STRUCTURE THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY DOES. HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO DO THIS VALUABLE WORK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS ALL HEARD ALL OF YOU TO THINK ABOUT OUR LICENSE PRODUCT. AS ITEMS ON THE SHELF WHEN YOU WALK INTO A STORE AND IT ANY MARKETER KNOWS IT ANY RETAILER KNOWS OCCASIONALLY THOSE ITEMS NEED TO BE REFRESHED. THEY NEED TO KEEP UP WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF DIGITAL INNOVATION THEY NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THE CONSUMER INTERESTS. ARE LIKE. YOU IN THE SAME DIRECTION WE FEEL THAT A COMBINATION FISHING HUNTING LICENCES. WILL PRODUCE MORE REVENUE THAN SHOWN IN OTHER STATES. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEMIC STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE CDFW IS THE LOSS OF LIFE IS REVENUE WE HAVE ONE MILLION FEWER ANNUAL FISHING LICENSE SOLD. EVERY YEAR SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. THAT IN ITSELF IS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL OF THE DEPARTMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO CAPTURE MORE PEOPLE GET INTERESTED IN BUYING LICENSES IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME STRUCTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
