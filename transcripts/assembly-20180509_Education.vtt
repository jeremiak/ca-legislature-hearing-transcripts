THAT WE.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.502
CONTEXT THE ANALYSIS. LAYS OUT

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.437
IN GREAT DETAIL HOW THIS

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:50.735
QUESTION.

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:52.837
BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:53.938
THEY PRESENTED DO YOU HAVE A

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:54.138
REAL.

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:56.207
RESPONSE OF THAT IN TERMS OF

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.042
WHETHER NOT THIS BILL IS LOOKING

00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:59.777
AT ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT GO INTO

00:32:59.844 --> 00:33:00.244
THIS.

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:01.813
HEALTHY KIDS ACT.

00:33:01.879 --> 00:33:04.749

ENGAGEMENT AND SO FORTH AND SO

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.052
ON AND WHETHER NOT THIS FITS IN

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.454
IN SOME WAY.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.089
YEAH I THINK THERE'S A

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.690
CONSERVATIVE DATA THE ANALYSIS

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:14.058
POINTS OUT SOME OF IT THAT THIS

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:16.260
IS BECOMING A GROWING PROBLEM

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:17.028
AND THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:17.662
THAT.

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.430
THAT CELL PHONES ARE BEING USED

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:20.732
USUALLY CELLPHONES BUT YOU'RE

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:22.633
ALSO ALSO COMPUTERS. ARE BEING

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.902
USED TO SHARE SESSION SEXUALLY

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.637
EXPLICIT PICTURES OF THE KIDS

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.272
SOMETIMES ADULTS ARE SOLICITING

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:29.507
KIDS FOR THAT SORT OF THING.

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.775
YEAH IT'S A GROWING TREND

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.176
THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR SURVEY

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:33.378
THAT.

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:34.812
SUGGESTED THAT FIFTEEN UP TO

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:36.681
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF KIDS HAVE.

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:37.548
AND GAUGE IN THIS KIND OF

00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:38.850
CONDUCT TO THE EXTENT THAT'S

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:39.717
BEING ADDRESSED RIGHT NOW

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:41.119
THROUGH EXISTING.

00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:41.953
CURRICULA I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.521
THAT'S

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:44.622
AFFECTED THAN THEIR SOME

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:45.957
DISTRICTS THAT ARE TAKING THE

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:47.258
POSITION AND LOOKING AT WHAT.

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:49.026
CAN BE IN A COMPREHENSIVE SEX ED

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:51.095
PROGRAM IN AS IT'S OUTLINED IN

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:52.430
THE AT CO RIGHT NOW.

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:54.031
THAT THAT IN LEICESTER

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:55.900
SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS THEM TO.

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:56.601
INCORPORATE THIS IN THE

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:57.402
CURRICULUM.

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:58.770
THEY ARE FEELING LIKE THEY

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.638
CAN'T DO IT. AND WE SIMPLY MADE

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:02.206
OPTIONAL BECAUSE IF THIS IS A

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:03.541
PROBLEM IN A PARTICULAR SCHOOL

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:04.208
DISTRICT.

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:05.910
THEY DO THIS BILL WOULD GIVE

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:08.312
THEM THE OPTION TO INCORPORATE

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:08.579
THAT PARK.

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:09.480
.

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.082
YES DO SOME PREVENTION KIND OF

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.383
TRAINING AND THAT SORT OF THING.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:13.518
WHERE THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:14.619
THE OPTION AT LEAST A LOT OF

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:16.087
THEM DON'T BELIEVE THEY DO IF

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:16.721
THEY'RE NOT HAVING A PROBLEM THE

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:17.088
DISTRICT THEN?

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:18.923
WE CAN.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.690
PROCEED WITH WHAT'S IN THEIR

00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:20.725
EXISTING.

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:22.760
SEX ED CLASSES

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:23.094
WOULD THERE.

00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:26.864
CURRICULUM PERSONS WHO DESIGNED

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.766
THE CURRICULUM BASICALLY BEING

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:30.735
ASKED TO DO THIS OR IS THIS JUST

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:32.136
SOMETHING WE SAYING YOU CAN DO

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.704
IT IF YOU FEEL LIKE DOING IT BUT.

00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:35.406
IS IT BEING TAILORED SO THAT

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:36.941
THEY KNOW THAT IT SHOULD FIT

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:39.544
INTO THE REGULAR CURRICULUM.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.078
JERRY MATCH I'M INTO THE CURRENT

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.747
CURRICULUM AS DESIGNED.

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:44.582
YOU I'M AUTHOR OF THE HEALTHY

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:46.851
KIDS AG BILL SO I AND I KNOW I

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.219
DIDN'T WRITE THE CREEK IN BUT I

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:50.087
KNOW HOW COMPLICATED AN

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:51.489
INTRICATE IT IS SO.

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:53.291
YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:54.559
THAT WHATEVER ADDITIONAL THINGS

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:55.660
COMING AND COMING AND IN A

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:56.761
CERTAIN WAY

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:57.361
SO THAT'S WHY I WAS WONDERING

00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:58.629
WHETHER NOT.

00:34:58.696 --> 00:35:01.032
THAT'S PART OF THIS MY MY INTENT

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:03.234
IS TO AUGMENT WHAT'S EXISTING

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:04.902
NOT. SUPPLEMENT OR RIGHT

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:07.338
SUPPLANT ANY OF IT BUT IF I. IF

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:08.339
I CAN IF I CAN ASK MY WITNESSES

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.007
RESPOND.

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.642
THAT'S EXACTLY ONE OF THE THINGS

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:12.810
THAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS WHEN I

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:13.744
READ IT.

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:15.680
AS WE KNOW EDUCATION IS

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:17.014
COMPLICATED WE KEEP CRAMMING

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:19.150
MORE AND MORE AND MORE INTO OUR

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:19.584
DAY.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.154
I SEE THIS FROM THE STANDPOINT

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:26.724
OF THAT DISTRICT FOLKS WHO ARE.

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:28.426
LOOKING AT THE CURRICULUM

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.161
DESIGNING THE COURSEWORK.

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.997
THE SCHOOL BOARDS IT JUST CALLS

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:35.800
THE ATTENTION TO OH YES THIS IS

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.568
A PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT WANT TO

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:38.836
MENTION THIS.

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:41.405
WITHIN WHAT WE ALREADY DO I

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.940
DON'T SEE THAT IT CHANGES

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:45.510
ANYTHING THAT WERE DOING. ITS

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:46.777
NOT GOING OUTSIDE OF ANY

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:48.412
GUIDELINES OF CURRICULUM OR WHAT

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.014
THIS LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:52.984
ALREADY ADOPTED. IT JUST BECAUSE

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.886
THE ATTENTION TO THE FOLKS THAT.

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:56.420
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.389
WE MIGHT WANT TO BRING THIS UP.

00:35:58.456 --> 00:35:59.957
BRINGING THE TECHNOLOGY PIECE

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:01.492
INTO IT.

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:04.295
SO ARE WE ASKING FOR THE PERSONS

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:06.464
WHO ARE WE ASKING FOR A SPECIFIC

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:08.733
A CURRICULUM TO BE DEVELOPED.

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:10.368
THAT WOULD THEN BE GIVEN TO

00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:12.003
SCHOOLS WHO MAY WANT TO

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:13.504
IMPLEMENT IT COULD CAN I CAN I

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.805
INTERJECT CHAIRMAN I MAY HAVE

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:15.973
SOME INFORMATION JUST UP TO HELP

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.408
YOU MAKE IT TO YOUR RIGHT. YOU

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.410
DID AUTHOR BILL AND THAT

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:21.712
FRAMEWORK THE DRAFT IS OUT. OKAY

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:23.180
SO THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOESN'T

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:25.583
TOUCH THAT FRAME OF THIS BILL

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.183
MERELY AUTHORIZES DISTRICTS.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:26.951
TO.

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:27.618
TO TO.

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.554
I'M TO WRITE INSTRUCTIONS ON

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.755
THIS AND MAYBE THAT IS THIS BILL

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:31.322
MAKES IT WOULD THROUGH THE

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:33.357
PROCESS. AND THAT FREE MARKETS

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:36.193
PROVED STILL WON'T BE NECESSARY.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.295
QUITE FRANKLY SO.

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.697
BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.365
AN ISSUE DOESN'T HAVE A MIDDLE

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:42.600
SCHOOLER ON HERE AND STUFF.

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.502
RIGHT SO.

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.771
AND HIGH SCHOOLERS OUTSIDE THE

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:48.806

QUITE FRANK ESPECIALLY MIDDLE

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:10.707
MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM?

SUBSTITUTES COMING THERE WITH

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:16.547
VIRTUALLY NO TRAINING. NO

00:45:16.613 --> 00:45:18.549
TRAINING AND PUT THEM IN A CLASS

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:20.284
OF FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.486

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.987
THE RESULTS CAN CAN VERY MUCH

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:25.556
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS TO

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.625
THAT A VERY VALID CONCERN. I

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:30.461

SUBSTITUTES.

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.167
FACT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT SOME

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:38.936
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A POOL

00:45:39.002 --> 00:45:40.671

PERFORM THOSE MORE LONG TERM.

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:46.977
SUBSTITUTE POSITIONS I THINK

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:47.978
THAT WOULD BE KIND OF WISE

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:49.947
POLICY FOR SOME SOME DISTRICTS

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:51.648

STUDENTS NEED.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.855
SO THE IDEA THAT THIS IS TIED TO

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:37.025
VIRTUAL SCHOOLS. IS SIMPLY FALSE

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.193
IT IS NOT TIED TO VIRTUAL

WHICH THE CHARTER SCHOOL IS

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:07.656
AUTHORIZED. BECAUSE OF THE

THROUGH THOSE INDEPENDENT STUDY

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:15.030
CHARTER SCHOOLS IT IS ESSENTIAL

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:17.299
BECAUSE OF THE BLENDED NATURE OF

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:34.015
REASONABLE DISTANCE.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.717
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.852
SERVICES SUCH AS THE ONES THAT

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:40.689
WE PROPOSE IN THIS BILL WHICH

SERVICES. AND SCIENCE LABS FOR

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.903
YOU SEE AG COURSES

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:57.972
PERIOD. ALL THIS BILL IS DOING

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:00.608
IS PROVIDING REASONABLE ACCESS

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:02.577
FOR THE PUPILS WHO HAPPEN TO

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.346
LIVE IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:05.880
THEIR AUTHOR THEIR CHARTER

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.849
SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED. BUT AT A

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:10.385
GREAT DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.287
GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES OF THE

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:14.489
AUTHORIZING DISTRICT. BECAUSE

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.824
THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:17.892
ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO BE ABLE TO

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:19.761
PLACE A RESOURCE CENTER IN AN

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.596
ADJACENT COUNTY.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:24.366
THE IDEA THAT. LOCAL CONTROL IS

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.835
BEING VIOLATED BY BEING ABLE TO

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:28.570
PLACE A RESOURCE CENTER IN

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:30.605
COUNTY IS NOT RELEVANT AT ALL

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.507
GIVEN THE DISTANCE.

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.175
SO I BELIEVE THAT ANSWERS ALL OF

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:36.411
YOUR QUESTION.

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.380
I DON'T KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.081
YOU BUT THANK YOU. THAT'S THE

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.216
FACT THE OPPOSITION WISH TO

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:44.219
COMMENT ON THAT AT ALL.

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:45.954
MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST SAY

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.655
IN TERMS OF THE DEFINITION OF

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.124
NON CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:49.691
VIRTUAL.

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.626
ONLINE INSTRUCTION IS INCLUDED

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.061
SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THERE'S A

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:54.629
CONVERSATION THAT THIS DOESN'T

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.331
INCLUDE ONLINE INSTRUCTION I

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:57.932
THINK IN GENERAL WHY. THE.

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.834
.

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.136

CERTAINLY FOR VIRTUAL CHARTERS.

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:05.940
HAS TO BE SOMEONE IS VERY SELF

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:08.109
MOTIVATED TO HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:09.511
IT'S OUT OLYMPIANS OUT ACTOR.

INDEPENDENT THEY CAN PERFORM

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:16.985
VERY WELL BUT BECAUSE AND TIMES

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.953
SOMETIMES HAS BEEN REALLY CAST A

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.422
BROAD NET ABOUT WHO CAN.

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:23.425
WHO IS A SOUGHT OUT TO PUT?

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.059

UTILIZE VIRTUAL CHARTERS

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.663
SOMETIMES IT MAY BE SOMEONE WHO

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.131
NEEDS MORE SUPPORT AND IS GONNA

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.332
GET LESS IN AN ONLINE

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.567
ENVIRONMENT AS A RESULT MAYBE

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:33.935
THEY'RE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:35.336
INSTEAD OF DOING INSTRUCTION SO

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:36.070

BASS CHARTERS THAT WOULD INCLUDE.

OUTSIDE OF THE DISTRICT

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:41.396
BOUNDARIES BUT WITHIN THE COUNTY.

OH FIVE POINT ONE.

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:55.069
AND AUTHORITIES DIDN'T ANSWER

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:56.304
THAT'S WHERE THE EXEMPTION LINE

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:57.839
LET ME JUST AND I REITERATE MY

01:27:57.905 --> 01:27:59.407
COMMITMENT THAT IF YOU DISAGREE

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:00.742
WITH OUR INTERPRETATION WE'LL

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:02.076
FIX IT TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:04.145
DOES NOTHING MORE. THAN TO SAY

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:05.613
THAT THESE CENTERS THAT ARE IN

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.948
THE MIDDLE THE DOWN OUT THERE

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:08.816
AYE THAT GRAY AREA ARE NOT

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:10.018
FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. PULL THIS

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:11.686
BILL GOES INTO NAVY AUTHORIZED

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:12.820
SHOULD THEY HAVE OVERSIGHT

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:14.789
THAT'S MY CONCERN TO DO THE

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:15.823
OPPOSITION WHICH THIS WEEK. JUST

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:16.724
TO BRIEFLY.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.126
CORRECT SOMETHING I HEARD IN

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:19.427
THE CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ALLOW

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:21.996
YOU TO SET. RESOURCE CENTERS AND

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:22.997
CONTIGUOUS COUNTIES WHAT IT

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:25.867
ALLOWS ITS ME A RESOURCE ONE

01:28:25.933 --> 01:28:27.635
RESOURCE CENTER IN IN THE

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:29.337
CONTIGUOUS COUNTY NOT NOT

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:31.839
MULTIPLE AND SO WHAT AGAIN WHAT

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:32.874
THE STATE BOARD HAS SAID

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.175
ESSENTIALLY IS YOU HAVE A YEAR.

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:35.710
IF YOU'RE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE

01:28:35.777 --> 01:28:37.311
DISTRICT TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:38.279
FROM THE DISTRICT WHERE YOU'RE

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:38.813
SITTING.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.615
AND SO THAT WAS INTENDED TO

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.150
PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME TO GO ALL

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:43.184
THE WAY THROUGH THE APPEAL

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.318
PROCESS IF NEEDED.

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:46.387
FOLKS NEED TO SEEK OUT THE

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:47.422
SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THEY'RE

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:50.692
SITTING AND SEEK AUTHORIZATION

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:51.659
AND THAT WAS DONE.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:52.827
THAT WOULD THAT THEY WERE GIVEN

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:54.829
A YEAR AND AND THAT WAS JAY LENO

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:55.463
ONE'S APPLY FOR A WAIVER SO THEY

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.364
DID.

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:57.265
SO YEAH THEY'RE OPERATING DOZENS

01:28:57.331 --> 01:29:01.035
ON LIVE FOR WAIVERS.

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:01.636
DOESN'T THE SECOND IN A PLAGUE

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:02.370
OF THE SECOND.

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:03.604
TO DO THAT.

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:06.274
THEY HAVEN'T YET.

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.408
APPLIED FOR A SECOND WAY RIGHT

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:08.876
RIGHT WHICH SO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:09.811
MAKE A SECOND THING RETURNED FOR

01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:11.412
SO I'D THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER.

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:12.280
QUESTIONS HERE.

01:29:12.346 --> 01:29:14.348
DETERMINE.

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:15.083
AND YOU KNOW JUST JUST IT.

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:19.020
.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:21.055
JUST LOOKING AT ME.

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:22.390
THAT THE LANGUAGE HERE IS

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:23.991
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M READING

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.393
IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I SEE.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.562
WHAT I SEE IS REASONABLE?

01:29:27.628 --> 01:29:29.363
AND IN TERMS OF THAT WHAT I READ

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:30.631
IS SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:32.033
IN THAT'S HERE SO IT MAKES IT

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.201
VERY CONFUSING.

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:35.069
BECAUSE IT I MEAN TO ME IT

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:36.404
WOULD BE LOGICAL TO BE ABLE TO

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:39.707
DEVELOP. A CENTER IT IN THE SAME

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:41.576
COUNTY WHICH IS MAKES MORE SENSE

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:43.077
FOR PEOPLE IN THAT DISTRICT THAN

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:44.345
IT DOES TO ALL THESE OTHER

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:45.313
COUNTIES THAT TOUCH IT BECAUSE

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:47.148
THE METS. MORE DRIVING TIME AND

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.816
SO FORTH AND SO ON SO IT IS.

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.151
.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.586
IT BUT IT DOESN'T SAY THAT HERE

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:53.287
THAT'S THE PROBLEM I HAVE WHEN I

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:55.189
READ THIS I'M KIND OF CONFUSED

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:56.057
AND NOT SURE WHAT WITH IN

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:57.525
DEALING WITH. VIRTUAL CHARTER

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:58.659
THAT HAVE NO SPACE WHERE THEY

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:00.161
CAN OPEN THESE THINGS ANYWHERE

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:01.863
IN THE STATE IN THE IN THE STATE

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:03.698
BECAUSE OF SAYS. YOU KNOW A A

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:05.066
BEING EXEMPT FROM EXISTING

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.734
GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS COULD

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:08.770
BE YOU KNOW HAVING A SCHOOL IN

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.338
OREGON SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THOSE

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:11.405
GEOGRAPHICAL.

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:13.307
STRICT XIN SO IT DOESN'T SAY

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:14.275
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE INTENDING TO

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.777
SAY.

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:17.945
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:20.448
IN TERMS OF THIS AT THIS TIME.

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:23.050
YOU KNOW BUT DOES.

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:24.218
IT IT'S BUT TO ME IT'S

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:25.920
REASONABLE THAT WOULD BE UP

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.421
WITHIN YOUR COUNTY BECAUSE IT'S

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:28.956
OBSCENE YOU CAN GET THERE FASTER

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.258
YOU KNOW AND IT'S AN AND THE

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:32.627
KIDS OF IT. AND I I'M REALLY

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:33.594
INTO MAKING SURE THAT.

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.863
WHATEVER WE DO IS CLOSE ENOUGH

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:36.798
SO THAT THERE'S SOME

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:37.765
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHAT'S

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:38.933
HAPPENING THAT THOSE WHO

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.102
AUTHORIZED CHARTERS CAN VISIT IT

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:42.136
AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DOING

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:43.237
WHAT SUPPOSED TO DO AND ALL

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:44.872
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. SO SEEMS TO

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.908
ME IF IT'S IF IT'S IN THE SAME

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.576
COUNTY TO MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE.

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:49.710
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OF

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:50.812
WHAT IS WRITTEN HERE AND THAT'S

01:30:50.878 --> 01:30:51.913
WHAT I HAVE TO GO ON.

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:52.079
AND.

01:30:52.146 --> 01:30:53.447
.

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.349
ANYWAY.

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:56.617
SO I I HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:58.019
I MEAN JUST OUT THE BILL'S

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.187
ADVOCATES HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH

01:30:59.253 --> 01:30:59.687
IT.

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:02.056
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIX IT

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:02.957
AND I KNOW IT'S VERY CONFLICT

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:04.659
COMPLICATE WITH LOT OF THE

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:05.693

IN THEORY THIS SHASTA BASED US

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:36.083
SCHOOL COULD OPEN A RESOURCE

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:43.050
TO THAT PROCESS AND IF NOT WHY.

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:44.151
ALL OF THAT ADDRESS THE

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.619
SPECIFICS OF THIS WHAT HE WHAT

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:46.954
HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IS WHILE

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.255
YOU DON'T GO OUT AND GET

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:49.623

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:07.975
ACCOUNTABILITY ACTUALLY THAT

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.510
BALKANIZED ACCOUNTABILITY. NOW

HAVE SOUGHT TO VARYING DEGREES

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:30.564

01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:32.733
REQUIREMENT OF THE WAIVER BY THE

COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:55.389
MR O'DONNELL SUGGEST.

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:57.591
THAT HAS.

01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:59.593
COME WITH MIXED RESULTS.

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.662
SOME HAVE BEEN MET WITH

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:04.031
RECEPTIVITY.

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:04.865
AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN MET WITH

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:06.167
PICKS

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:08.903
DREAM HOSTILITY.

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:11.705
IN FACT TOLD AT THE DOOR THAT

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:13.441
THEY WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:15.276
THEM AND THEY WOULD NOT EVEN

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.278
LOOK AT THEIR CHARTER PETITION

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:19.814
LET ALONE CONSIDERATE. SO.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.215
WHILE IN THEORY IT'S A WONDERFUL

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:22.917
OPTION.

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:24.752
PRACTICAL APPLICATION IT HAS

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:26.654
MIXED RESULTS.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.325
THE OTHER.

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.359
THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS

01:35:32.426 --> 01:35:34.228
THAT.

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.463
WITH THE DISTRICT AUTHORIZED

01:35:35.529 --> 01:35:37.665
CHARTER SCHOOL.

SOMETIMES IT'S.

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:40.968
IT'S NOT.

01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:43.370
FISCALLY POSSIBLE.

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.773
TO GO TO ANOTHER DISTRICT WHERE

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.808
MAYBE ONLY TWENTY OR THIRTY OR

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.543
FORTY OR FIFTY STUDENTS ARE

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.246
BEING SERVED. IN THAT PARTICULAR

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:54.748
AREA AND GET A NEW CHARTER

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:57.318
SCHOOL AUTHORIZED THAT WOULD BE

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:59.453
ABLE TO SUSTAIN ITSELF. SO WE'RE

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.022
TALKING ABOUT. PERHAPS

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:04.024
THE DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE

01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:06.360
CURRENT AUTHORIZD CHARTER THAT

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.828
SERVING.

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:10.831
A FEW DOZEN STUDENTS AND. THAT

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.633
AS A SEPARATE CHARTER WOULD NOT

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.802
BE FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE BUT

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:15.970
YOU STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.471
PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:19.607
STUDENTS AND YOU DO SO WITH THE

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:21.742
EXISTING CHARTER. WITH A

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.611
RESOURCE CENTER IN ADVANCE SO

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:25.746
ARE GOING AND AND THAT'S WHERE

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:27.615
YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:28.549
WORLDS A DIFFERENT.

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:29.783

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:33.988
GIVING.

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:35.956
SORT OF THE BACKGROUND.

01:36:36.023 --> 01:36:38.459
AND I WAS FOLLOWING YOU.

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:40.294

MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT THE BETTER

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.368
YES IN THERE SOMEWHERE I FELL

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:49.637

THAT.

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:56.443
.

01:36:56.510 --> 01:37:01.048
YOU AGREE THAT THE LAW. ALLOWS.

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:03.150
A BLENDED LEARNING SCHOOL.

.

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:08.088
TO OPEN A RESOURCE CENTER.

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:10.024
IN.

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:12.226
COUNTY WORDS AUTHORIZE.

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:14.495
GOING TO JC CAN A COUNTY

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:14.962
ADJACENT TO WHERE IT'S

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:15.896
AUTHORIZED

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:16.664
WITHIN THE AUTHORIZING DISTRICT

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.566
DISTRICT.

01:37:18.632 --> 01:37:19.533
IF THE INDUSTRY IN THE

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.968
AUTHORIZING DISHES BOUNDARIES

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:23.370
YES OKAY AND AND JASON COUNTY

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:25.673
OKAY BUT NOT IN THE REST OF THE

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:26.674
COUNTY. LOOK REALLY WHAT'S

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.275
MISTER THERE WITH ME ARGUED HERE

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:30.044
IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DISTRICTS

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.946
AUTHORIZE THE ENTIRE COUNTY.

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:33.847
NOT COUNTY'S AUTHORIZED THE

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:35.549
ENTIRE COUNTY. THAT'S THAT'S

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:36.317
WHERE THIS WILL ALSO GUIDE

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:38.219
ANYTHING AND I GET THAT WHY THE

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:39.486
ARGUMENT THAT.

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:40.654
THERE SHOULD BE AN APPLICATION

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.122
FOR COUNTY BENEFIT I GET THAT

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.957
I'M GONNA ASK A DIFFERENT

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:44.425
QUESTION THE LAST TO THE AUTHOR

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:45.993
TO EVER YOU WANT TO ANSWER IT.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.761
I'M LOOKING JUST AT THE BILL

01:37:47.828 --> 01:37:50.097
LANGUAGE NOW I READ THE ANALYSIS.

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:51.832
I LISTENED

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:53.834
I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:55.302
THAT I MIGHT BE THERE AND THEN I

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:56.904
THOUGHT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.472
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:00.241
LANGUAGE AND I HEAR.

01:38:00.307 --> 01:38:01.508
WHAT I SEE IN THE BILL LANGUAGE

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.110
IS DIFFERENT WHEN I HEARD WHAT I

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:05.279
HEARD TODAY CONSISTENTLY WAS THE

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:06.580
ABILITY TO OPEN A RESOURCE

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:07.448
CENTER IN A WAY THAT'S MORE

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:09.083
CONVENIENTLY LOCATED FOR

01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:10.417
STUDENTS BILL TO GET TO ACCESS?

01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:12.186
SEEMS REASONABLE WHEN I READ THE

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:15.656
BILL LANGUAGE ALL I SEE. IS THAT.

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:18.726
AN EXEMPTION TO ALLOW.

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:20.494
EXEMPTION FROM GEOGRAPHICAL

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.895
RESTRICTIONS THAT'S ALL I SEEN

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:23.530
THE BILL LANGUAGE

01:38:23.597 --> 01:38:24.698
AND SO I DON'T SEE WHERE THE

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:26.567
BILL LANGUAGE MATCHES UP.

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:31.505
WITH THE THEMES THAT WE HURT DAY.

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.073
WELL I MEAN I I ALREADY ANSWERED

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.208
THAT MISTER THURMOND IN THAT

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:34.475
THERE'S.

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:37.278
YA SEPARATE SECTION OF THE CODE

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:38.112
THAT RESTRICTS.

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.413
ENROLLMENT AND SO.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.714
THE.

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:41.382
YOU KNOW.

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:43.217
HAS IT IN THEORY YOU COULD THAT

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:44.084
HAVE A SATELLITE.

01:38:44.151 --> 01:38:45.352
RESOURCE CENTER.

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:48.756
pPART OF THE STATE BUT. THE

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:50.324
STUDENTS THERE WOULDN'T WOULDN'T

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:51.392
BE ABLE TO ENROLL IN THE SCHOOL

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:52.993
SO IT WOULD MAKE ANY SENSE AND

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:53.994
YOU WOULDN'T SEE THAT.

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:56.030
ONCE AGAIN I'M PUTTING IT ON

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:56.730
THE RECORD THAT.

01:38:56.797 --> 01:38:58.999
THE THING THAT YOU SAID SOUNDS

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:00.701
REASONABLE IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.469
TRYING TO DO HERE. THERE'S NOT

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:05.406
SOME SINISTER SCHEME. REMOVE

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:07.341
RESTRICTIONS AND HAVE THE WHOLE

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:09.176
STATE BECOME VIRTUAL SCHOOLS NOT

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.944
WHAT'S GOING ON IN FACT THE

01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:12.746
RESULT OF REJECTING THIS BILL IS

01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:13.747
GOING TO BE THESE BLENDED

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.149
SCHOOLS HAVING TO BECOME MORE

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:16.817
VIRTUAL BECAUSE REMOVING. THE

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:18.419
ABILITY OF STUDENTS TO ACCESS

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:19.553
THE PHYSICAL SITE WHERE THEY DO

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.387
THINGS LIKE HAVE DIRECT

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:21.922
INTERACTION WITH TEACHERS GET

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:23.390
ACCESS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.793
SERVICES. PREMIERS HAVE A QUITE

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:26.493
PLACE TO DO HOMEWORK.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.761
I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:28.329
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO GET

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:30.664
LAST.

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:32.366
OR MORE DISTANCE FROM THOSE WHO

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:33.934
SEEK TO HELP THEM.

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:35.235
BUT AS I READ THE LANGUAGE OF

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:36.870
THE BILL THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.772
BILL GRACE IS A HUGE CONCERN FOR

01:39:38.839 --> 01:39:41.642
ME. AND THAT IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:44.611
MANY CREATES AWAY TO CREATE MORE

01:39:44.678 --> 01:39:45.579
DISTANCE BETWEEN.

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:47.648
SCHOOLS.

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:52.953
VIRTUAL SCHOOLS BLENDED SCHOOLS.

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.388
IT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT YOU SIX

01:39:54.455 --> 01:39:55.923
DON'T WANT TO TO CREATE DISTANCE

01:39:55.989 --> 01:39:57.925
FROM WHERE STUDENTS WILL BE

01:39:57.991 --> 01:39:59.860
BECAUSE IT'S NOT BRICK AND

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.729
MORTAR AND THAT CREATES. AN

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:02.896
EXEMPTION WOULD THERE'S NO

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.998
GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARY AND IT

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:07.401
CREATES DISTANCE BETWEEN. THE
