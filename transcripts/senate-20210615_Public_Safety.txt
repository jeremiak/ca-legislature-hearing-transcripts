WHERE WE ARE NOW HEARING ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE EIGHTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I THINK THE CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK TODAY CURRENT LAW REQUIRES JUDGES TO IMPOSE A SENTENCE FOR THE OFFENSE OF CARRYING THE LONGEST POSSIBLE TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS FUNDED IS ACCUSED OF MULTIPLE OFFENSES DURING A SINGLE ACT THIS TOUGH ON CRIME- POLICY REMOVES THE DISCRETION THAT JUDGES PREVIOUSLY HAD TO CHARGE A DEFENDANT WITH THE SENTENCE DEEMED MOST APPROPRIATE DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT CON. CONTEXT OF THE CRIME. CONTINUE TO PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR THE LONGEST AMOUNT OF TIME REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT OF THE CRIME. AND HISTORY OF THE OFFENDER DOES NOT REHABILITATE THE PERSON OR GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO BE BETTER IN THE FUTURE. OVER THE LAST DECADE CALIFORNIA'S TAKEN STEPS TO REVERSE THE HARSH POLICIES OF THE PAST BY RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCRETION. AND INDIVIDUALIZED SENTENCING. SB FIVE EIGHTEEN RESOURCES DISCRETION THE JUDGES PREVIOUSLY HAD. GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO FAIRLY SENTENCE AND ACT AND TO EXERCISE DISCRETION WHEN DETERMINING A SENTENCE FOR AN ACT PUNISHABLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. BY DIFFERENT VERY PROVISIONS OF LAW. WE MUST CONTINUE. FORWARD AND WORK TOWARDS MODERNIZING OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM BY ENSURING THAT SENTENCES ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE ACT. BY PHONE TODAY I'VE STEVEN MUNN CELTICS ACTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE TO TESTIFY. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IBM. FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM YOUR- MAIN WITNESS IN SUPPORT MR MONK HELPED. ARMY MAY BE PERCEIVED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN- I AM VERY EXECUTIVE RECORDS CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WHICH IS A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL- EXPERTS FROM MANY FIELDS HAVE SHOWN US THAT THIS THE MASS INCARCERATION POLICY IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS IS BAD POLICY. IT'S FAR MORE EXPENSIVE ARE LESS FAVORABLE OUTCOMES FOR SOCIETIES AND SHORTER SENTENCES ALL OF OUR SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME TO HELP THEM ESTABLISH IMPLEMENT. A LOT OF OUR LIFESTYLES. BUT NINETY SO AND THEN THE TO KILL BECAUSE SECTION SIX FOUR WEST OF THEM INCARCERATION MOVEMENT. IT TOOK DISCRETION AWAY FROM THE JUDGE WHOSE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IS TO DECIDE ON AN APPROACH APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMES AND GIVE IT TO PROSECUTORS PROPER ROLE IS TO SEE A CONVICTION AN ADVOCATE FOR PUNISHMENT. THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING AT THIS POINT THAT THIS WAS A MISTAKE CHANGES LIKE THIS UNBALANCED OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MAKING IT LESS JUST AND MORE EXPENSIVE. AB FIVE CAN SIMPLY REVERSES THE CHANGE MADE IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. IT GIVES DISCRETION BACK TO THE JUDGE TO WEIGH THE CRIME THE DEFENDANT AND THE SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO FIND A JUST SENTENCE IN THE PARTICULAR CASE. THE ARGUMENTS OPPOSING THE BILL FROM C. AIR SHOW QUITE CLEARLY THAT THEY HAVE NOT LEARNED ANYTHING FROM DECADES OF HARM DONE BY MASS INCARCERATION. THEY'RE STILL ARGUING THAT THE ONLY SENSE WHICH CAN EVER BE JUSTIFIED AS THE MOST JUDITH WHAT. EVERY CRIME AND EVERY DESCENDANT IS DIFFERENT. WE NEED JUDGES WHO STAND APART FROM THE ADVERSARIAL CONTEST TO FIND JUSTICE IN EACH CASE BY IMPOSING AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST PUNITIVE. THIS IS A SENSIBLE AMENDMENT WE ASK FOR YOUR SOCIAL. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER LEAD WITNESSES THAT SINGLE OR SINGLE LEAD WITNESS. APART SAID HER SINGLE LEAD WITNESS BUT LET US SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE WILL LOOK IN YOUR FLOW ROOM SEEING NINE. MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE- QUEUE UP ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE EIGHTEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT FOUR IN Q. OR GOING TO WIND SEVENTEENTH PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU I'M TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. CANACCORD ARE NOT ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU I'M FIFTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MERGING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU RYAN TWENTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. CAROLINA APPROVED ON THE HAS IT OF ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT- WE DO HAVE A LEAD OF OPPOSING WITNESS AND THAT IS MISTER MORRIS FROM TH CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION YOU MAY PERCEIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE EIGHTEEN. THE PURPOSE BEHIND THE CURRENT VERSION OF PENAL CODE SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR IS TO ENSURE THAT THE PUNISHMENT FITS THE CRIME AND THE DEFENDANT RECEIVES NEITHER EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT NOR EXCESSIVE LENIENCY. THE LANGUAGE THAT AB FIVE EIGHTEEN NOW SEEKSTO EXCLUDE WAS ADDED TO SECTION SIX REPORT IN LEGISLATION OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO TO PREVENT A DEFENDANT FROM RECEIVING WHAT AMOUNTED TO A SENTENCING WINDFALL. AS THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THAT AMENDMENT MADE CLEAR THE LEGISLATURE WAS PROPERLY CONCERNED OTHER DEFENDANTS WHO COMMITTED A MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE. FALL COMMITTING SIMULTANEOUSLY AT SECOND LEFT DURING THE GROUND ARISING FROM THE SAME COURSE OF CONDUCT COULD THE STATE APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT ON THE MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE. WHEREAS THE DEFENDANT WILL ONLY A MINUTE THE MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE BUT NOT. THAT STOOD. LOGIC INPUT. LOOK AT. FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE PC FIFTY FOUR WAS A MAN. I DEFENDED COULD CONVICTED OF KID THE OF ABROAD. AND ALSO CONVICT OF THE CRIME ACROSS. COULD BE SENTENCED ONLY FOR THE ROBERT. AS THE LEGISLATURE NOTED THEM QUOTE IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE THAT A DEFENDANT CONVICTED OF A STRING OF CRIMES COULD AVOID BEING SENTENCED ON THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME FOR WHICH YEAR SHE WAS CONVICTED AND QUOTE. THAT REASONING IS EQUALLY APT TODAY. LET ME PROVIDE A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FALL INTO COULD COME FROM PASSAGE OF THIS BILL. PERSON COULD BE TRY WITH THE BLOWS MURDERED FOR THIS CAR. UNDER THIS THE JUDGE TO SENTENCE THE FIRST SO. FOR THE FALL. AND SAY THE MURDER. OR CONSIDERING IN WHICH SOMEONE CHARGED MURDER DRIVING DRUNK. AND THEY'RE ALSO TRYING THE TICKET FOR THE- UNDER BILL JUDGE. JUST ON TO YOU I DIDN'T STAY THE FEDERAL MARKET. THERE ARE SOME OF KARJAT ALL. UNDER THIS BILL IS COULD SENTENCE ON THE AUTO ALONG AND- THEN ON THE MORE. HARD JACK. BY CETERA PERSON THE BACK OF A BIO WAY AND THIS BY BUT SAME. AGAIN UNDER EIGHT FIVE EIGHTEEN THE JUDGE IT'S ON THE SEX BATTERY ONLY. AND STATE OR THAT. THE GIRL LAW THAT THE BILL SEEKS TO AMEND THE GROUP DRAFTED THIS. TO AVOID THESE KINDS OF NON. OUT WE ARE OF ANY IN. ARE SO. IT'S THEM PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM THE ONE. THE CHANGES SIMPLY UNLESS. WE ALL YOU WILL TAKE CONSIDER THE MENTAL ILLNESS AND CERTAIN- LITIGATE BECAUSE I BY WILL. OF THE COMMON LIMITATION CURRENTLY EXISTING IN SECTION. SIX FIFTY FOUR. ACTUALLY ABSOLUTE NOBLE. PART ON WHETHER LEAD OPPOSITE PERSON RICK- DESIGNATED SO AND WE WILL GO TO- OPPOSITION WHO FIRST SEE IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE ROOM. HERE PRESENTS NO- IN IN THE OVERFLOW ROOM THERE'S NOT SO MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY. COLORS THAT ARE WANT TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE EIGHTEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT SO- I HAVE A QUESTION. ON THE IN THE OPPOSITION'S- STATEMENT I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS SAID BY MISTER MORRIS BUT I'M JUST READING- ACTUALLY IT WAS ONLY SOMETHING THAT THE D. ASUS- SUBMITTED WHICH SAYS THAT. IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE THAT A DEFENDANT CONVICTED OF A STRING OF CRIMES COULD AVOID BEING SENTENCED ON THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME FOR WHICH HE OR SHE IS CONVICTED AND MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS. YOUR BILL DOES NOT PREVENT TO JUDGE FROM. SENTENCING UNDER THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME DOES IT RACKED THEY CAN STILL- SENTENCE THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT FOR THE MOST SERIOUS PART OF THE CORE OF THE CRIME SHOULD THEY SO CHOOSE. OKAY SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY. BUT IT WELL THE MY REAL POINT IS THAT IF. WHILE THE JUDGE MADE A SORT DISCRETION. THERE STILL COULD BE OBVIOUSLY BUT D. M. THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENSE COULD BE THAT WHICH IS- SENSE UNDER IN ANY AND ANY ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS OR WHAT HAVE YOU THAT MAY BE ON THE BOOKS THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY JUST GIVE THE JUDGE MORE OPTIONS DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT OF THE CRIME AND THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME AND WHATEVER OTHER. EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WANT TO TAKE INTO. ACCOUNT WHEN THEIR- GIVING UP SENTENCING. OKAY ALL RIGHT- LET ME SEE IF ANY FURTHER MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS MONTH. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION- I. WANT TO SAY SENATOR I MEAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS- THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BILL BECAUSE- WHO. JUDICIAL DISCRETION I THINK THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE IT WILL THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE STATE. PERHAPS GAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE JUDICIAL DISCRETION BUT THEN WE KIND OF. LIKE IN THE PENDULUM WE WENT FROM PERHAPS TOO MUCH TO THEN. PRETTY MUCH RESTRICTING NONE I THINK NOW WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT BALANCE. AND WHILE JUDGES ARE LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT PERFECT. CERTAINLY THEY ARE. THEY ARE IN EITHER ELECTED OR APPOINTED TO THE BENCH WITH THE- WITH PEOPLE'S INTENTION OR THE POINTERS INTENTION THAT THEY- ARE COMPETENT THAT THE UNDERSTAND THE LAW. AND THAT IN THOSE CASES WERE DAY. HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE DISCRETION THAT THEY WILL USE GOOD I ALWAYS LOVE THIS WORD JUDGMENT IN DOING SO AND SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A REAL VALUE BECAUSE IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN THE PURPOSE OF TO MY POINT OF VIEW A JURY TRIAL. IS THAT WE ARE BRINGING IN A JURY OF THEIR PEERS TO HAVE PEOPLE SSS CIRCUMSTANCE AND USE THEIR OWN JUDGMENT HOWEVER IN EVEN WITH THE- WITH OUR JURY SYSTEM NOW THEY DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND. THAT THE JUDGE MAY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SENSE THE CERTAIN WAY AND THEN IN EFFECT WERE ALMOST UNDERMINING THE WHOLE- JURY PROCESS SO. I THINK THAT THE BALANCE OF RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS A WISE THING AT THIS POINT TO DO. I'M SORRY PRESHEAF YOUR BILL AND GO AHEAD SENATOR CORMANN ORDER. SORRY I GOT CAUGHT UP I JUST WANNA- ECHO YOUR SENTIMENTS MADAM CHAIR- AND YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH JUDICIAL DISCRETION WE WANT JUDGES TO HAVE IT UNTIL WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY DO AND THEN WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE IT. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO GET OVER THAT SCHIZOPHRENIA- AND ALLOW WE HAVE TO PUT OUR FAITH TO WHAT GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN TOLD US ON THE PENAL CODE COMMITTEE. OUR REVISION COMMITTEE WE HAVE TO PUT OUR FAITH IN THE JUDGES. AND HAVE FAITH THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB. AND IF THEY CAN'T. THEN YOU COME BACK AND SAY HOW CAN WE HELP PROVIDE THEM GREATER GUIDANCE. THEY ACTUALLY ON. THE SIDE OF CONSERVATIVE SENTENCING BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE KNEE JERK REACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AND ALSO THE PUBLIC. AND THE OTHER REALITY IS THAT WHEN WE'RE COMING UP WITH THESE LAWS AROUND SENTENCING SAID THE YEARS ARE REALLY ARBITRARY. THEY ARE ARBITRARY AND THEN WE BUILD ON THEM WITH ENHANCEMENTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THE FOUND AND YET THE FOUNDATION. THERE'S NO ANALYSIS BEHIND THE ORIGINAL- BASED SENTENCE TIME AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO JUST RECKON WITH THAT THAT'S HOW WE HAVE HAD THIS EXPLOSIVE METASTASIZE PRISON POPULATION BECAUSE WE'RE PICKING NUMBERS THAT SOUND RIGHT AND THERE'S NO ONE ALICE'S BEHIND THEM. AND THEN WE HAMSTRING JUDGES ABILITY- TO USE THEIR BRAIN WHICH IS WHY GENERALLY WHY THEY'VE BEEN APPOINTED OR WE VOTED FOR THEM BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S IN THEIR BRAIN IS OKAY. AND IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE TO OFFER RANGES AND TO ALLOW JUDGES TO USE DISCRETION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE CHARGE AND BASED ON THE CRIME IN BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND INSTEAD WE HAVE PROSECUTORS. WHO WANT TO JUST READ. SERCOMBE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE NUANCES AND COMPLEXITIES TO A CASE TO THESE ARBITRARILY DECIDED. SENTENCING YEARS AND THEN HOLD EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE UNIVERSE THAT IS COMPLETELY BLACK AND WHITE EXCEPT THAT SOMEBODY WILL BE BORN AND SOMEBODY WILL DIE. THOSE ARE THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE CONSTANT. SOURCE FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THAT I DO SUPPORT THIS AND I WANTED TO SHARE BUT I GOT CAUGHT UP IN READING SOMETHING ELSE AND SO THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME AND SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. TO RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS FOR YOU TO GO AHEAD SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU- SAN SKINNER ON THAT I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD ITHINK YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF. WHETHER IT'S JUDICIAL DISCRETION OR NOT OR SINCE THE WAY THAT THE PENAL CODE IS RED AND OR ONE HAND SPENCER ARE WHAT THE BAY SENSES ARE. THE COMMONALITY AROUND ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE DESIGNED- A- JUSTICE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS DESIGNS. TO IMPOSE THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE PENALTY WHETHER IT'S- MANDATING THE JUDGES- IMPOSE THE HIGHEST SENTENCE OR PROHIBITING JUDGES. FROM POSE INFORMATION OF THE BILL- THAT WE HAD AND- SOMEWHAT CLOSER TO THIS MORNING OR- THE PILING ON OF ENDLESS ENHANCEMENTS. IT'S JUST IT'S A SYSTEM THAT'S MOVED AWAY FROM HOW DO WE PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY HOW DO WE REHABILITATE PEOPLE TO HIRE WHICH IS PACKED PEOPLE- IN THE PRISON. AND YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A- IT'S A FAILURE IT HASN'T WORKED- IT'S JUST TAKEN YOU KNOW WITH THIS ENDLESS SUCKING. SOUND OF MONEY INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW THE INTEREST IS A YOU YOU LOOK AT OUR PRESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. EVEN WITH ALL THE REDUCTIONS THAT HAPPENS DURING COVE IT IT'S STILL REALLY HIGH. IT SALLY WE HAVE LIKE A SPARSELY POPULATED STATE PRISON SYSTEM ITSELF HIGH IT'S NOT. UNCONSTITUTIONALLY HI THE WAY IT WAS WERE WAS SO CROWDED THAT YOU COULDN'T EVEN HAVE LIKE ENOUGH BED SPACE LET ALONE PROVIDE HEALTH CARE. BUT IT'S STILL REALLY HIGH EVEN AFTER THE RATHER DRAMATIC REDUCTION DURING COVE IT AND BECAUSE OF REALIGNMENT ETCETERA. AND SIGN THAT SHOWS JUST HOW- POORLY DESIGNED THE SYSTEM IS AND HOW SERVE HONESTLY IMMORAL- IT IS AND SO I'M I'M SORRY THAT THE DA'S FELT THE NEED TO OPPOSE- TO OPPOSE THIS BILL I HOPE WE CAN MOVE AWAY FROM. ON SOME OF THE KNEE JERK OPPOSITION TO ANYTHING THAT MEANS LESS INCARCERATION- THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. SOME RIVER WORKS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YOU GUYS DID A GOOD JOB CLOSING FOR ME WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. RIGHT SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS WE DO HAVE A MOTION- WHICH SENATOR WIENER MADE FIRED CORRECT YES- SO THE- MOTION IS.

THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES RECOURSE FOR THOSE FORCED TO PAY RENEWAL FEES BY ALLOWING THEM TO COLLECT DAMAGES FOR ANY VIOLATION BEFORE I PROCEED WITH MY COMMENTS. LIKE TO SHARE MY OFFICE HAS HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH LAST MINUTE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. END THANKS TO MY STAFF OUR SPONSORS AND ESPECIALLY THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I AGREE TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING IN MEN'S AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH WILL ONE REMOVED A RETROACTIVE APPLICATION TO EXISTING POLICIES RELATING TO IMMIGRATION BONDS. AND TO INCLUDE BUT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE IMMIGRATION BOND SECTION TO JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS THE OPPOSITION HAS AGREED TO GO NEUTRAL. AB THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN PROTECT FINANCIALLY BURDENED DEPENDENCE AND THE FAMILIES AGAINST UNJUSTIFIED FEES BY PROHIBITING BAIL AND MIGRATION BOND AGENTS TO CHARGE A POOL SECOND PREMIUM TO A PERSON WHO HAS NOT HAD THEIR CASE RESOLVED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS ONE YEAR THE AVERAGE BELT IN CALIFORNIA IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. MOST OF US MOST PEOPLE MOST OF US DO NOT HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AVAILABLE SO MANY FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO TURN TO A BAIL AGENT THAT WILL CHARGE THEM 10% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT BUT- AS A PREMIUM. THAT MEANS FAMILIES ARE LOCKED INTO PAYING FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY YEAR THEIR LOVED ONES CASES IS NOT RESOLVED. THE BILL COMPANY THEY ARE UNDER CONTRACT WITH CHARGES OF RENEWAL PREMIUM. TO COVERT NINETEEN COURTS ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG LEADING TO LONGER TALK TIME LINES IN CASES TO BE HEARD. A RECENT REPORT FOUND THAT AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UNATTENDED. AND SENTENCED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN COUNTY JAILS FOR LONGER THAN THREE YEARS. AWAITING A TRIAL OR SENTENCING. AND IN IMMIGRATION COURT BACKLOGS SHOWS THAT THERE OVER A HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO THOUSAND PENDING CASES WITH AN AVERAGE TIMELINE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THEY'VE REMAINED UNRESOLVED FOR THESE REASONS I'VE AMENDED THE BILL IN HIS COMMITTEE TO BUY PROTECTIONS TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. SIMPLY PUT FAMILY SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO TAKE AN UNFAIR I'M FARE COSTS JUST TO HAVE THEIR LOVED ONE SAFE AT HOME WHETHER WAITING FOR THE TRIAL OR SENTENCING.

I ALSO CONCUR WITH THE AUTHOR REGARDING AMENDMENTS HE JUST PROBABLY DESCRIBED IN ACCEPTED IN HIS TESTIMONY. WE ARE PURSUING AB THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN THIS YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT ON BAIL BONDS AND IMMIGRATION BONDS ARE BEING SUBJECT TO UNNECESSARY. NONREFUNDABLE RENEWAL FEES. ALLEN HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED EVEN MORE DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHICH IS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN COURT CASES BEING HEARD. CHARGING THE SAME NONREFUNDABLE FEE MOLD CLAIMS WHEN IT CONSUMERS CASES NOT BEEN RESOLVED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS IS AN ARBITRARY PRACTICES USED BY THE BILL INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PROFITS. OFF UNSUSPECTING CONSUMERS THIS PRACTICE IS ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR TO CONSUMERS THIS BILL IS NEEDED NOW TO HELP CURB THESE PREDATORY BUSINESS PRACTICES. THAT MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO CHARGE THESE UNNECESSARY NON REFUNDABLE RENEWAL FEES. ON BILL BONDS AND IMMIGRATION BONDS. AND IN ADDITION THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE HARM CONSUMERS WITH THE CRUCIAL ABILITY TO COLLECT DAMAGES FOR ANY VIOLATION WHICH COULD OTHERWISE THREATEN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF HARD WORKING FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVERS ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW GO TO MR SCHARF. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RIO SHARK FROM AN ATTORNEY AT THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA I MANAGE THE BILL CONNECT LEGAL SERVICES CLINIC FOR CONSUMERS A BAIL BONDS IMMIGRATION BONDS WE REPRESENT MORE THAN A HUNDRED CLIENTS ELIMINATED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT. OUR CLIENT EXPERIENCE A WIDE RANGE OF ABUSES THE PRESSURE IN THE FINAL CONTRACT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND MISLED ABOUT THE TERMS AND THE CASE AGGRESSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE IT HAPPENS BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO MISTREATMENT. PEOPLE PICKING BAYLOR IMMIGRATION BONTA DESPERATE KIND OF SECURE THEIR OWN RELEASE OR THEIR LOVED ONES RELEASE FROM JAIL OR DETENTION FACILITY EACH ADDITIONAL THEIR THE PENSION INCREASES THE RISK AND COUNTERING VIOLENT CONTRACTING A VIRUS LOSING HIS JOB OR EVEN CUT THE APPOINT KIDS. PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE AND COMPANY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BECAUSE WE CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO NEGOTIATE FAIR AND REASONABLE CONTRACT TERMS IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROTECT THEM AB.

ONLY PURPOSE THESE FEES OF TWENTY EIGHT BOND COMPANY. BUT THEIR IMPACT IMPACT THE BOTTOM PEOPLE HAVE LONG QUICKER. THE COSBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC BY LENGTHENING COURT PROCEEDINGS HAVE SUBJECTED MANY MORE PEOPLE TO THE ANNUAL RENEWAL PREMIUM. SO NOW REALLY IS A CRITICAL TIME TO ADDRESS THIS PRACTICE. IN ADDITION TO BE HARMFUL THESE EITHER UNNECESSARY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES OPERATING WITHOUT THEM. IT JUST ACTUALLY LAUDABLE THE AB THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN INCLUDE IMMIGRATION BONDS ANNUAL RENEWAL PREMIUMS ARE VERY COMMON IN THE CONTRACT AND THESE CONSUMERS ARE ESPECIALLY UNLIKELY TO SPEAK UP ABOUT CONTRACT TERMS. EDUCATED PENDLE AFTER THAN CASE MEANING CONSUME. HAVE TO PAY MORE ANNUAL RENEWAL FEES OVER TIME. WE MUST NOT LET THE IMMIGRATION BOND INDUSTRY BECOME OUT AND TRANSIENT.
