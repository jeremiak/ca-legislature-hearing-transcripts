THEY TOO OFTEN FIND IT

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.421
INADEQUATE. FRAGMENTED AND

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.323

WE'RE PROVIDING THROUGH MANY OF

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:38.611
OUR COUNTY SPECIALTY BEHAVIORAL

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:39.945
HEALTH SYSTEMS POSSIBLY ALSO

AND YOUNG ADULTS AS WELL- AND

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:48.821
TWO CHILDREN. AND THE MORE THAT

MY COMMENTS THAT WERE PREPARED

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.863
HERE. IF WE CAN MEET STUDENTS

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.265
AND USE WHERE THEY ARE AND A

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.101
MORE INTEGRATED FASHION- WHICH

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.335
FOR MOST STUDENTS IS SCHOOL

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.570
THAT'S WHERE THEY SPEND THE

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:06.872
MAJORITY OF THEIR DAYS- I THINK

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.307
THAT WILL BE A REALLY FRUITFUL

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.509
EFFORT AND SO. I THINK TO THE

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.044
EXTENT THAT WHATEVER

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:13.879
PROGRAMMING WERE WERE LAUNCHING

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.981
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL OR

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:17.216
WHATEVER WE'RE DOING THROUGH

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.251
THE WAIVER PROPOSALS THAT WE

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.453
ARE- BEING STRATEGIC AND HOW WE

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.390
INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES. TO ALIGN

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:24.990
MORE CLOSELY WITH THEIR THEIR

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:27.092
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. YEAH I THINK

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.160
THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:29.962
AREA WE HAVE THE SURGEON

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:31.930
GENERAL IN TALKING ABOUT

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:33.565
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:35.834
AND- HOW THAT AFFECTS A NUMBER

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.737
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. LIKE

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:41.273
EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.775
ABILITY OFTHE TEACHERS TO

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.343
TEACH IN A CLASSROOM WITH KIDS

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.780
THAT HAVE. BEHAVIORAL ISSUES

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.948
THAT NEED TO BE HANDLED.

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:53.652
APPROPRIATELY THERAPEUTICALLY.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:56.822
AND IT THERE A STRONG LAW. TO

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.557
WE NEED. WITH THE EDUCATION

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.893
SYSTEM. AND A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.162
SYSTEM. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:04.863
VERY WORTHWHILE GOAL AND I

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.498
SHOULD MENTION TO THE MENTAL

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:08.267

OPERATIONALIZE IN SOME FUNDING.

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:12.705
FOR INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.607
BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND-

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:16.675
AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:18.310
SYSTEMS TO DO THE KIND OF

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:18.911
INNOVATIVE WORK THAT YOU'RE

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:20.312
DESCRIBING SO I THINK.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.081
ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO THINK OF

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.482
HOW OUR TOOLS THROUGH MEDICAL

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:24.917
TRANSFORMATION HELP US TO DO

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:26.752
THAT WORK AND TO SITUATE THE

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.153
CLINICIANS THAT THAT ARE

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.288
PREPARED TO SERVE YOUTH

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.522
PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH SPECIAL

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:32.358
NEEDS WITHIN THEIR SCHOOLS AND

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:34.159
MEETING THEM. AGAIN WHERE THEY

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:37.329
SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME. SOME

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.264
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO ASSN AREA

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:42.301
ABOUT- AN AREA I'VE BEEN VERY

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:44.770

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:47.840
OF PEER SUPPORT SYSTEMS THE

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:49.141

GOING ON WITH THAT ISSUE. I

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:09.161
THINK THAT WE ALIGN WITH A GOAL

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.963
OF HAVING A MORE PURE SUPPORT

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.297

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.781
WHERE I THINK WE SEE NEED IN

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:03.749
WHERE TELL HEALTH COULD BE

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:06.952
HELPFUL CERTAINLY WE HAVE A

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.153

THROUGH TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES

IF YOU WILL. ACCESS TO

TELEHEALTH IS THE PANACEA AND

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.743
THEN RELEGATE PEOPLE IN RURAL

THEIR ONLY INTERACTION BEING ON

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.116
A VIDEO SCREEN. SURE AND I I'VE

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.617
I SHARE THAT VIEW I THINK THAT

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.420
TELL HEALTH IS ONE TOOL THAT WE

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.322
SHOULD BE EXPLORING AND USING

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:52.658
WHEN APPROPRIATE. AND IT CAN

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.493
ALSO BE USED NOT JUST FOR

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.427
DIRECT SERVICE DELIVERY BUT

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:57.496
ALSO CONSULTATION WITH

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:58.730
PRACTITIONERS WHO MAY BE

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:01.066
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS- MAYBE

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.134
PEDIATRICIANS ARE OTHER

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.902
PROVIDERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:05.304
SUCH THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.505
GAIN SOME EXPERTISE FROM A

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.607
SPECIALIST TO MAY BE SITUATED

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.943
REMOTELY- SO WE DON'T REPLACE

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.415
ALLIANCE THAT MAYBE THERE. IN

00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:18.050
ADDITION I THINK- WORKFORCE

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.184
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES THAT

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.920
INCENTIVIZE CLINICIANS TO

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:23.422
RECEIVE TRAINING AND TO

PRACTICE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:26.992
ARE ALSO THINGS THAT- THIS

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.860
ADMINISTRATION AND THE CURRENT

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:31.029
BUDGET YEAR HAS EXPLORED AND

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:31.830
THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT AS WELL

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.031
IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE THAT

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.866
WE CAN EXPLORE. AGAIN

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:35.901

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.607
PROVIDE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:42.708
IN RESPONSE OF TREATMENT I

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.042
THINK THAT'S THAT'S ALSO VERY

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.677
WORTHWHILE GOAL BUT THINK ALSO

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.313
IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC BUDGET-

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.248
FOCUS ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:52.918
CAN YOU SHARE ANY OF THOSE.

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:54.519
INITIATIVES WITH THIS I THINK

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.054
WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN IT WE

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:58.690
REALIZE THAT IT IS A PRIMARY

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:02.594
NEED AND AN ESSENTIAL PART. OF

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:04.997
PROVIDING MORE CAPACITY FOR-

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:06.264
THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE IN THE

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:08.634
PEOPLE THAT. THAT ARE- NOT

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.535
NECESSARILY ACCESS ACCESSING

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.070
COORDINATED- AND TIMELY

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:14.039
SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE SO

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.775
IT'S AN AREA OF FOCUS THERE ARE

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:17.776
AND I THINK A NUMBER OF

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:18.910
DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT WERE

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.812
EXPLORING. BUT AGAIN OPEN TO

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:22.514
CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.683
LEGISLATURE ABOUT ONE IS WE

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.951

TRAINING OR PRACTICE IN RURAL

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.700
BEEN A FIGHT. TO KEEP THE THAT

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:43.435
FUNDING IN OUR BUDGET I HOPE

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:45.537
THE GOVERNOR AND THE

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:48.240
LEGISLATURE WOULD SUPPORT. NOT

LOOKING TO HOW WE MIGHT

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:52.811

FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS.

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:11.963
LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC CHARGE-

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.999
RESIDENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:15.600

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:29.927
SOME ADDITIONAL SERVICES FOR

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:32.630
VETERANS SO OBVIOUSLY UNDER

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:34.665
SERVICED. AND OF COURSE THE

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:36.534
RESULT OF THIS IS THAT STUDENTS

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:38.336
WITH VERY HIGH NEEDS AND

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:40.571
SUICIDALITY I'M NOT GETTING THE

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:43.140
RIGHT KIND OF CARE. THAT THIS

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:46.110
LACK OF- AND MENTAL HEALTH FOR

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:47.245
THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM FROM

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:49.680
PREVENTION THROUGH INTERVENTION

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:51.816
AND TREATMENT AND THIS LACK OF

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:54.151
INTEGRATION WITH ALL OTHER

00:35:54.218 --> 00:35:55.419
KINDS OF NEEDS THOSE BEING

00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:59.290
HOUSING FOOD AS WELL. AND ONE

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:00.825
THING THAT I'LL MENTION IS THE

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:03.261
HEALTHY MINDS NETWORK WHICH IS

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.630
A LARGE- TEAM FOR MICHIGAN THAT

ESTIMATED THAT IF WE WERE TO

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.707

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:19.944
HEALTH TO COLLEGE STUDENTS.

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.579
THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:23.948
SAVINGS IN TERMS OF TUITION

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:26.017
REVENUE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:27.485
WHO DROP OUT BUT MORE

00:36:27.552 --> 00:36:29.520
IMPORTANTLY THE BE SIGNIFICANT

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:31.522
INCREASES IN THE EXPECTED

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:33.457
LIFETIME EARNINGS OF THE

00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:35.760
STUDENTS. THE SOLAR FAR

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:38.229
OUTWEIGH THE COST OF DELIVERING

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:44.602
SOLUTION. TO THIS PROBLEM OF-

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:47.004
RATES OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY IN

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:49.340
COLLEGE STUDENTS- WE CALL IT

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:52.376
THE STAND PROGRAM SCREENING AND

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:53.210
TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:54.912
DEPRESSION. IT DELIVERS

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:58.082
SCALABLE GOLD STANDARD EVIDENCE

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.283
BASED TREATMENTS THAT A

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.986
PERSONALIZED TO THE NEEDS OF

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.988
EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT. IT

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:06.324
PROACTIVELY IDENTIFIES IN

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.193
RESPONSE TO URGENT NEEDS

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.629
SUICIDE HOUSING AND FOOD NEEDS

THE PATIENT IN ORDER TO ADAPT

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.402
THE TREATMENT TO THEIR NEEDS AS

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:20.404
THOSE NEEDS EVOLVE OVER TIME.

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:24.141
SO IT'S A FULLY ADAPTIVE MODEL.

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:25.610
THERE'S A DIAGRAM ON THE NEXT

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:27.178

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:33.270
CLINICIAN DELIVER TREATMENT

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.539

THE COACHING. CLIENT SO IT

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:46.650
TRYING TO COMBINE TELEHEALTH

WITH IN PERSON TOUCH. THEY ARE

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:51.388
CONTINUOUSLY TRACKED SO ONCE

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:54.859
THE TRIAGE INTO A LEVEL OF CARE.

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:57.161
THEY CONTINUOUSLY REPORT THE

SYMPTOMS THROUGH THIS MENTAL

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.431
HEALTH TRACKER SO THAT WE CAN

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:04.869
DO TWO THINGS. FIRST ANY

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:07.171
INDICATION OF SUICIDALITY.

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.473
SENDS A MESSAGE AN AUTOMATED

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.309
ALERT TO A TWENTY FOUR

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.644
SEVENTEEN THAT THEN REACHES OUT

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:14.578
TO THE STUDENT TO CHECK ON

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:19.350
THEIR SAFETY SO IT'S VERY-PROACTIVE OUT REACH. SECOND

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:22.119
THIS ONGOING TRACKING ALLOWS US

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:24.021
TO ADAPT TO THE TREATMENT

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:26.323
SURVEY INITIALLY BEGAN WITH A

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.059
MILD LEVEL OF DEPRESSION

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:29.827
ANXIETY AND RECEIVING ONLINE

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:32.096
THERAPY. THEIR LIFE CONDITIONS

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:35.533
CHANGE THEY WORSEN WE MOVED UP

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.601
TO THE HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. IF

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:39.103
THEY STARTED IN THE HIGHER

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.805
LEVEL OF CARE WAS CLINICIANS

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.907
THE ROOM PROVED THEY'VE MOVED

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.508
DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVEL OF CARE

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:46.811
BECAUSE MAINTENANCE IS ACTUALLY

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:49.346
CRITICAL TO PREVENTION OF

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:52.883
RELAPSE. SO IF YOU GO TO THE

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.319
NEXT PAGE THAT SIMPLY LISTS HOW

00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:57.555
THE SYSTEM IS INNOVATIVE. IN

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.790
THE WAYS THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:02.059
IT'S AN FULLY INTEGRATED

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:05.129
ADAPTIVE SYSTEM OF CARE AND I

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.831
WOULD SPEND MORE TIME ON THAT.

GOING NOW ON THE NEXT PAGE IS

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:52.243

APPROACH FOR THE COMMUNITY

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:16.153
COLLEGE. A DIFFERENT DAY IN THE

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.790
UC AND WHAT OUR WATER THE

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:21.925
DISTINCT DIFFERENCES THE

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:24.361
TEMPLATE THIS THE STRUCTURE THE

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:27.698

IT'S SO IT'S AN INTEGRATED

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.868
SYSTEM WHAT DID FOR THIS IS

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:33.137
PRIMARILY THE CONTENT TO BE

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:34.605
RELEVANT THEY NEED SO WE'VE

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.240

THE- THE REAL EMERGENCY THAT

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.533
WE'RE FACING IN THE YOUNGER

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:32.869
POPULATION- THE WORK FORCE OF

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:34.604
THE FUTURE I MEAN YOU SHARE THE

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:36.173
CHEN I THINK IT WAS AGAIN. HE'S

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:39.309
STILL A WITH THIRTY SIX

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:42.112
THOUSAND STUDENTS IN FIVE- SOME

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.181
FIVE PROFESSIONAL YES TWO OF

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:48.852
THOSE INTERNS RATE SO. IF YOU

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.821
HAD A MAGIC WAND WHAT WOULD BE.

00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:53.657
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:57.728
TO REALLY- BUT BY THE SUPPORT

00:49:57.794 --> 00:50:00.364
THAT STUDENTS MIGHT NEED. TO

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.566
ANSWER THAT QUESTION THERE WILL

00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:04.401
NEVER BE ENOUGH COMMISSIONS TO

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:07.471
ADDRESS THE NEED. AND SO WHILE

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:09.406
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PLACE TO

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:10.841
CONDITIONS THAT'S WHY NOW MODEL

00:50:10.907 --> 00:50:13.143
CLINICIANS ARE RESERVED FOR THE

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.945
ONE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WAS

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:16.279
MOST SEVERE REALLY IT DOES NOT

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:17.547
MAKE SENSE TO GIVE AN ONLINE

00:50:17.614 --> 00:50:20.484
THERAPY PROGRAM. BUT MILD TO

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.184
MODERATELY DISTRESSED

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:23.353
INDIVIDUALS WILL RECEIVE IF

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.855
THEY DO THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:26.223
WHERE THE COACHING COMES IN

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:27.891
WE'LL GET AS MUCH BENEFIT FROM

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.826
THAT AS THEY WOULD FOR MANY IN

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:32.028
PERSON THERAPY VISIT. AND IT

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:34.398
PREVENTS THE ESCALATION UP TO

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.066
THE HIGHER LEVELS SO WE SEE

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:37.134
THESE THINGS IS WORKING

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.135
TOGETHER WE NEED MORE UNDER

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.704
CONDITIONS. BUT THAT'S RIGHT.

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:42.205
MORE QUESTIONS AND USING

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:44.007
TECHNOLOGY AND TOGETHER

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:45.308
REDUCING THE BURDEN ON THE ON

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.144
THE COMMISSION YEAH SO IT MAY

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.712
BE TOO EARLY BUT DO YOU ARE YOU

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.547
COLLECTING DATA DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.716
DAA TO SHOW. YOU SHARED SOME

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.418
NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:57.487
ACCESS TO. THOSE THAT HAVE GONE

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:59.723
TO A MORE SEVERE CATEGORY BUT-

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.459
ANY METRICS OF HOW THAT EARLY

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:05.362
INTERVENTION HAS KEPT PEOPLE

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.397
THOUGH NOT MANAGEABLE LEVEL YEP

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:09.566
SO OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT I

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.001
SHOULD PUT IN A FLOOD OF OUR

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.135
RESULTS WITH OUR RESULTS SHOW

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:14.037
THAT THOSE WHO AND WHO ARE IN

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:15.005
THE MILDER LEVELS INTO THE

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:16.706
ONLINE THERAPY. THE SYMPTOMS

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:20.076
REDUCE ON AVERAGE DOWN TO A

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:22.779
NORMAL TO MILD LEVEL- AND THOSE

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:25.515
WHO COMING TO US VIA- CATEGORY

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:27.017
AT FIRST RESPOND VERY

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.518
POSITIVELY TO THE TREATMENT SO

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:29.786
WE'RE GETTING VERY GOOD RESULTS

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:32.389
WE DON'T HAVE. RANDOMIZED

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:34.257
CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH THIS.

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:35.592
BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPLEMENTATION

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:38.228
STRATEGY OUR GOAL IS TO SEE

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.696
THROUGH COMPARING STUDENTS WHO

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.131
ENROLL WITH US TO STUDENTS WHO

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:43.133
DON'T IN ROLE WHAT HAPPENS TO

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.035
THEM OVER TIME THREE WELL THANK

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:47.904
YOU THINK THAT DATA WOULD BE OF

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:53.777
INTEREST AS WELL AN INMATE.

REPORT AND- A FEW MONTHS BACK I

00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:07.190
BELIEVE- AND I HAD SPENT SOME

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.558
TIME IN EAST LA COLLEGE AND-

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.293

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.597
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AROUND

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:15.365
EAST LA COLLEGE BECAUSE IF

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.767
REALLY STEPPED UP. THEY FOUND A

00:52:17.834 --> 00:52:18.902
REALLY HUNGER IS ONE OF THE

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.037
BIGGEST ISSUE THAT OUR STUDENTS

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:23.540
ARE FACING IT IS. IT'S A CRISIS

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.308
AND DOES SOME OF THE BUSINESSES

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:27.410
AROUND THERE HAVE. STARTED TO

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:28.879
OFFER VOUCHERS FOR STUDENTS TO

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.580

REPORTED HAVING. ONE MEAL A DAY

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:35.352
AND THAT IS. VERY MINIMAL AND

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:36.953
SO SOME OF THE BUSINESSES

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.321
STARTED SAYING THAT IF THEY

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:39.856
CAME IN WITH A VOUCHER FROM THE

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.458
SCHOOL THEY WOULD FEET I'M IN

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.559
AND NOT TELL STUDENTS HAVE BEEN

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:43.994
GETTING BY. I'M HOPING TO

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.062
EVENTUALLY EXPLORE THIS HOW WE

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.097
CAN DO THIS ACROSS THE STATE

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:49.666

CREDITS FOR BUSINESSES A

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.202
PARTICIPAR AROUND COMMUNITY

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.371
COLLEGES BUT BUT THAT WAS THE

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:56.406
LEADING CAUSE OF THE STRESS AND

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:57.741
ANXIETY FROM THE STUDENTS THAT

00:52:57.807 --> 00:53:00.377
I SPOKE TO- NOT HAPPY MEALS

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:01.878
AND- NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY'RE

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:03.813
GOING TO SLEEP IN. AND SO THIS

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.416
IS VERY PROMISING TO ME- AND I

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:07.717
HAD THE SAME QUESTION I

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:09.619
BELIEVE- THAT THE CHAIR ASSN IN

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:10.720

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:12.889

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:16.626
IN TERMS OF. THE COMMUNITY

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:17.694
WE'RE DEALING WITH IN

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.329
PARTICULAR BECAUSE I KNOW SOME

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.331
OF. THE COMMUNITIES IN THAT

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:24.367

HAS REMAINED A KIND OF LEVEL.

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.066
BUT SOMETHING HAS BEEN

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:07.835
HAPPENING- IN IS NOT THE ONLY

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:10.705
CALIFORNIA BASIS NATION WIDE-

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:13.441
IN THE LAST THE AT LEAST TEN

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:16.110
YEARS BY P. ET SO IT IS

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:18.045
AFFECTING AT THE POPULATIONS

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.647
BAT EIGHTIES WAR SING

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:21.549
CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO THE

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:25.520
NATIONAL- LABEL. IF I MAY I

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.188
JUST ME WHEN YOU SET THAT

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.023
BECAUSE I MEAN I KNOW THAT

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.491
THERE'S SO MANY REASONS WHY YOU

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.627
KNOW OUR POPULATION IS TO PRESS

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:34.862
THE VANS PERSONAL HISTORY. BUT

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.397
YOU KNOW WHEN I GO BACK TO- MY

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:37.899
EXPERIENCE AS AN EDUCATOR I

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:39.467
MEAN I REMEMBER PRIOR TO THAT

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.335
THE DEPRESSION ARE HERE IN

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:44.505
CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS TWENTY

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:45.740
EIGHT EIGHT OR NINE WHERE YOU

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:46.641
KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.876
HOMES IN. AND SO THERE WERE SO

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.745
MANY CUTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.346
SYSTEM AND I REMEMBER WE USED

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:54.582
TO HAVE FULL TIME COUNSELORS.

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:56.117
AND I CAN TELL YOU HOW VALUABLE

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:58.252
THOSE COUNSELORS WORK TO ME IN

01:30:58.319 --> 01:30:59.620
TERMS OF HAVING STUDENTS WITH

01:30:59.687 --> 01:31:00.888
ISSUES THEY WOULD GO TO THE

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.056
COUNSELOR THAT COUNTS FOR NOT

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:02.890
ONLY WOULD WORK WITH THE

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.292
STUDENTS BUT- THEY WOULD

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:05.459
CONNECT WITH THE PARENTS AND

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:06.861
THEN HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.296
COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF THE

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:09.430
INSURANCE AND HOW DO YOU GET.

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:11.065
OUTSIDE HELP AND SELL THAT

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:14.435
EARLY TREATMENT. WAS ESSENTIAL

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:16.003
AND I JUST WONDER THERE'S A

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.905
CORRELATION BETWEEN. ALL THE

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.273
SERVICES WE'VE LOST IN THE

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.842
SCHOOLS AS IT PERTAINS TO

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:21.609
MENTAL HEALTH LIKE OUR

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:23.945
COUNSELORS AND- AND YOU KNOW WE

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.980
USED TO HAVE THERAPISTS. LOSING

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:27.548
THEM AND NOW NOT HAVING

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:28.549
ANYTHING IN SCHOOL TO KINDA

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:31.385
HELP THE EARLY STAGES AND- I'M

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:33.087
JUST WONDERING IF. YOU HAVE ANY

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:35.122
THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE IT

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.324
LIKE AGAIN WE HAD SOMEONE THAT

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:37.992
WE CAN SEND. OUR STUDENTS TO

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.393
THAT WOULD HAVE A ONE ON ONE

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.528
AND I THINK MRS SMITH YOU

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:42.029
MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT.

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:43.764
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP MENTORS

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.166
YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE OR AT

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.267
LEAST OUR YOUTH ARE. MORE

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.902
INCLINED TO SPEAK UP AND THEY

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.604
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP LOW OF IT

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:50.471
SOMEONE THAT THEY BUILD A

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.940
RELATIONSHIP WITH. AND SO I'M

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:53.507
JUST WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:56.410
THOUGHTS ON THAT. YES IT'S A

01:31:56.477 --> 01:31:58.145
GREAT POINT BY A NINETY AYE

01:31:58.212 --> 01:32:00.248
EVA. I THINK THAT THERE IS A

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:04.752
RELATIONSHIP. A UNFORTUNATELY I

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:08.189
THINK A- THAT BY WE HAVE INDOOR.

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:10.658
AS AS GOOD A JOB AS WE COULD.

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:13.594
IN PARTNERING WITH SCHOOLS. FOR

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:17.431
EXAMPLE SO TEACHERS. ARE

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:19.500
BEARING FORM. ON HOW TO

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:22.703
IDENTIFY. SYMPTOMS US. ORDER OR

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:25.773
SIGNS. A SURLY S. PORTABLE.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.842
AIN'T BEEN UNFORTUNATELY. IS

01:32:27.909 --> 01:32:30.144
STILL. YOU KNOW THE BETTER

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:32.046
TEACHERS THAT TALK ABOUT THE-

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:35.049
DIESEL BEATING KIDS. OR OR KEY

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:37.051
STEP BUT YOU KNOW JUST THEM PAY

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:39.020
ATTENTION. WITHOUT THINKING

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:41.289
THAT. SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOING

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:44.759
ON. IN THEIR LIVES. EIGHTEEN

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:48.029
AND I THINK. THAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:49.897
ALSO CLASSES THAT TEND TO BE

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:51.732
BIGGER. THAN BEFORE SO THEY

NEED FOR TEACHERS TED TO BE

01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:47.121
EDUCATED IN THIS. IN THIS ARENA

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:48.522
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AS A

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:50.124
TEACHER YOU'RE NOT TAUGHT TO BE

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:51.492

YOU'RE THERE TO TEACH AND-

01:33:53.127 --> 01:33:54.628
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING

NOW. THERE IS NO RESOURCES SO

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:57.932

01:42:18.765 --> 01:42:20.701
THE GROUND PARTNERSHIPS- FOR

01:42:20.767 --> 01:42:22.302
EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:32.412
TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR EFFORT-

01:42:32.479 --> 01:42:33.413
THERE IS A MENTAL HEALTH

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:47.127
IT WILL IT FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:49.696
REACH THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY AND

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:51.865
THAT TO ME IS ONE OF THE WAYS

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:53.634
TO GO DIRECT TO THE SOURCE TO

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:54.801
GET THEM INVOLVED IN THE

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:56.270

REALLY REINVENT THE WHEEL. BUT

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:09.049

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:55.362
PUTTING. REPORTED ANY. OF EIGHT

01:48:55.428 --> 01:48:57.097
PER. NUMBER ROOM SEKAI EMERGE.

01:48:57.163 --> 01:48:58.999
IN IN THE OF EIGHT YEARS THAT

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:01.134
NGUYEN FROM IT FOR HER. TO TWO

01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:01.735
EIGHT AND AS WE BEFORE ALSO

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:03.169
WERE VERY CONCERNED A SUICIDE

01:49:03.236 --> 01:49:04.571
HAS NOT BECOME THE SECOND

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:08.341
LEADING- BECAUSE OF DEBT IN CAN

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:11.811
CHILDREN ARE AND YOU. SO WHEN

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.446
WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT

01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:14.648
CAN BE DONE I THINK THAT IT'S

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:17.250
IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:18.018
THE ISSUE OF ACCESS AND ACCESS

01:49:18.084 --> 01:49:20.854
TO CARE- WE KNOW IT WAS SAID

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:23.323
BEFORE THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:24.758
RANGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:25.759
ARE BEING SPRINGS BUT I

01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:27.360
COMMUNITIES 50% OF THEM

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.695
MANIFEST THEMSELVES FOR SAID

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:30.130
BEFORE BY AGE FOURTEEN SO I

01:49:30.196 --> 01:49:31.398
CANNOT THINK OF ANY OTHER TYPE

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:32.532
OF INTERVENTION TO POTENTIALLY

01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:35.201
COULD TARGET 50% OF THE PROBLEM

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:37.103
BY PAYING ATTENTION TO IT SO WE

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:37.971
WERE TO PAY ATTENTION TO

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:39.606
CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THAT NONE

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:41.107
OF FOR SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.742
EARLY ON WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:44.778
HELP WHERE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:45.979
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT EARLY

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:47.814
IDENTIFICATION AND EARLY

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:49.182
INTERVENTION ARE KEY TO

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:50.784
POSITIVE OUTCOMES THE SOONER WE

01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:52.585
CAN IDENTIFY THESE PROBLEMS TO

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:54.321
BETTER IT IS VERY CONCERNING

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:56.389
THAT SOME MOST STUDIES INDICATE

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:59.859
THAT 6280% OF YOU IN CALIFORNIA

01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:01.594
IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL

01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:03.229
DRAW THE COUNTRY ARE NOT

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:04.731
GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED WHEN

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:06.533
THEY NEED IT SO IT'S NOT

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:08.268
SURPRISING THEN THAT THESE

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:09.302
PROBLEMS CONTINUING DEVELOPED.

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:10.403
TO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:12.439
CHALLENGING AND WE'RE STARTING

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:13.239
TO SEE OTHER SYSTEMS OF CARE

01:50:13.306 --> 01:50:14.841
BEING IMPACTED WEEPING IN

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:17.010

CHAPTER IN SAN DIEGO AND THEY

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:20.680
RIP TO GET THROUGH SEARCH MORE

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:30.090
MORE AND THEY'RE SEEING A NEED

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:31.391
TO MAYBE DO MORE SCREENING SO

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:41.134
QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS DâN.

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:42.435

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:54.180
INTEGRATION WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:56.349
GOALS OF AN MEDI CAL A

01:55:56.416 --> 01:55:58.084
REIMAGINING THAT'S TAKING PLACE

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:59.319
IN THE STATE'S IS AN IMPORTANT

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:01.487
COMPONENT SO WE ALREADY WORKING

ON TRYING TO MAKE THAT WORK AND

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:05.158
TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW THIS

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:06.859
DISC WITH THIS COULD FUNCTION

01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:08.027
IF YOU COULD IF I COULD CALL

BRING UP TO YOU. SO THE WAY THE

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:19.172
SYSTEM COULD WORK IS THAT IF

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:20.606
THE PEDIATRICIAN IS WILLING TO

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:22.275
SCREENING AND IDENTIFY AS EARLY

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:23.843
AS CAN BE THE CHALLENGE OF THE

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:25.812
PROBLEMS ARE THAT YOU TO THE

01:56:25.878 --> 01:56:27.347

COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THEY

01:56:40.626 --> 01:56:41.928
NEED. AND THE OTHER THING THAT

01:56:41.994 --> 01:56:43.763
WE'RE DOING IS THAT WE ARE

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:45.431
BUILDING THIS CONTINUUM OF

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:47.467

TRADE IS A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:04.817
THAT REALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL

01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:06.152
TO TAKE US FROM ONE END TO THE

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:08.354
OTHER AND STEP YOUTH UP OR

01:57:08.421 --> 01:57:10.590
DOWN. DEPENDING ON ON WHAT WE

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:12.992
NEED- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:13.893
IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.762
NEED TO FOCUS ON AND WHAT

01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:16.562
POTENTIALLY COULD BE THE

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:22.869
FUTURE. SO. VIEW OF. ABLE

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:23.469
MINUTES AGO A QUICK WAS BEING

A CHALLENGE IS DIFFICULT AND

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:28.100
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY

COMPONENT TO WORK FORCE ON.

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:37.109
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:40.079
FOR ALMOST PROVIDING SERVICES.

pACTUALLY PRETTY SLAM.

02:03:30.603 --> 02:03:32.438
TRADITIONALLY AND MARCH THIS IS

02:03:32.505 --> 02:03:34.373
ALREADY POINTED THIS OUT WE

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:37.176
THINK ABOUT- HOSPITALIZATION OR

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:38.444
IN THE OFFICE OUT PATIENT

02:03:38.511 --> 02:03:41.046

02:03:41.113 --> 02:03:43.415
ABOUT IT WHILE ON THE MEDICAID

02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:47.153
SIDE THERE'S- WE CAN BE IN WHAT

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:49.121
I WOULD CALL IS SEEKING MODE

02:03:49.188 --> 02:03:51.490
RATHER THAN A WAITING MODE THE

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:54.493
TRADITIONAL. SORT OF SERVICES

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:56.362
ARE DELIVERED IN THE OFFICE YOU

02:03:56.428 --> 02:03:58.364
YOU WAIT FOR THAT CLIENT

02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:00.699
PATIENT TO COME TO YOU. VERSES

02:04:00.766 --> 02:04:02.301

DELIVERING SERVICES WHERE. THE

02:04:05.704 --> 02:04:08.574
PROBLEMS EXIST SO I THINK

02:04:08.641 --> 02:04:10.943
THERE'S A- HUGE DIFFERENCE THAT

02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:13.512
WE'VE EXPERIENCED BETWEEN THE

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:16.048
COMMERCIAL PLANTS EMPLOYER

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:17.516
BASED INSURANCE EVEN. IN THE

AVAILABLE IN THE MEDICAID SIDE

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.422
SO WHEN I TALK DIRTY IT'S NOT

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.591
PARITY SO MUCH BETWEEN PHYSICAL

02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:26.725
AND MENTAL HEALTH A LITTLE BIT

02:04:26.792 --> 02:04:29.094
SO. THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE IT'S

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:31.764
PARITY BETWEEN PORTS AVAILABLE

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.933
ON THE PUBLIC SIDE IN WHAT I

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:35.801
THINK SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:38.170

02:10:12.404 --> 02:10:14.573
AT THIS TIME IN CALIFORNIA SO

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:16.775
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES OKAY AND

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.644
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE

02:10:18.710 --> 02:10:20.245
TO REALLY DICTATE A BENEFIT

02:10:20.312 --> 02:10:22.915
PACKAGE WELL HERE'S BUT BUT I

02:10:22.981 --> 02:10:25.584
THINK- THERE IS WE CAN DO A

02:10:25.651 --> 02:10:28.587
LAWN OKAY. BUT TRIED FOUR TIMES

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:30.923
GOOD THE P. I THINK IF A RANGE

02:10:30.989 --> 02:10:32.457
OF SERVICES IT'S I THINK IT'S

02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:33.959
IN THEIR FINANCIAL INTERESTS TO

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:37.729
BE PROVIDING SERVICES IN HOME-

02:10:37.796 --> 02:10:39.631
AND AVOIDING HOSPITALIZATIONS

02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:41.600
DO YOU GO AHEAD YEAH I JUST

02:10:41.667 --> 02:10:44.703
WANTED TO ADD TO THAT- THAT A I

02:10:44.770 --> 02:10:45.804
THINK THE DEFINITELY THERE'S

02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:47.039
GOING TO BE ROOM TO BE ABLE TO

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:47.539
HAVE CONVERSATION WITH

02:10:47.606 --> 02:10:49.074
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:50.108
REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF DOING

02:10:50.175 --> 02:10:51.677
THIS. ON THE MEDICAL SIDE YEARS

02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:53.145
OR MORE RANGE OF OPTIONS BUT I

02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:54.112
THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT

02:10:54.179 --> 02:10:57.449
WE HAVE IS LIKE THIS TO SYSTEM

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:58.016
NOW WE HAVE BETWEEN MANAGED

02:10:58.083 --> 02:11:00.252
CARE MEDI CAL AND WHAT'S

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:00.953
HAPPENING WITH THE WITH THE

02:11:01.019 --> 02:11:02.754
COUNTIES OF MAKES IT SOMETIMES

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:04.389
DIFFERENT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE

02:11:04.456 --> 02:11:05.924
TO NAVIGATE THOSE TO SYSTEMS

02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:07.059
EVEN THOUGH THE BENEFIT MAYBE

02:11:07.125 --> 02:11:08.894
THERE SOMETIMES YOU MAY BE

02:11:08.961 --> 02:11:09.795
CHALLENGING CHALLENGING TO

02:11:09.861 --> 02:11:11.163
ACCESS IT SO THAT'S AN

02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:12.564
IMPORTANT THING THAT WILL BE

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:16.435
IMPORTANT TO A. TO INVESTORS AS

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:20.472
WELL. DID YOU DO. THANK THE

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:22.207
BEACH THE TWO SYSTEM. IF THE

02:11:22.274 --> 02:11:23.075
REMAIN LIKE TO ARE THERE WOULD

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:26.144
BE. PEOPLE IN FAMILIES THAT

02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:28.080
WOULD DROP INTO THE MEDI CAL

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:29.982
SYSTEM FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE

02:11:30.048 --> 02:11:32.117
OR IS IT HAPPENING NOW. WHERE

02:11:32.184 --> 02:11:32.985
THEY HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE

02:11:33.051 --> 02:11:35.487
WELL THEN THEY DON'T GET THE

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:37.389
TYPE OF SERVICES. MAYBE THEY

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:38.991
NEED THROUGH THE PRIVATE

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:41.960
INSURANCE AND THEY WOULD. THEN

02:11:42.027 --> 02:11:43.729
RETRIEVE THOSE SERVICES FROM

02:11:43.795 --> 02:11:45.764
THE MEDICAL SYSTEM OR SOME

02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:49.334
OTHER PUBLIC SYSTEM IS THAT IT

02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:51.303
IS A THAT DOES HAPPEN NOW DOES

02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:53.605
HAPPEN NOW YES OKAY YEAH SO

02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:55.340
THAT'S A COST TO THE STATE AND

02:11:55.407 --> 02:11:57.976
EARLY IT IS THE CAR THROUGH THE

02:11:58.043 --> 02:12:01.947
MEDICAID SYSTEM FOR US YES THE

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:03.482
ONE THING TO JUST CLARIFY THERE

02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:05.617
REALLY ARE THREE SYSTEMS THURS

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:06.451
WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE

02:12:06.518 --> 02:12:07.586
COMMERCIAL AND THEN YOU HAVE

02:12:07.653 --> 02:12:09.321
ALL THE DIFFERENT PLANS

02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:12.658
EMPLOYERS MAY GO FOR. THEN YOU

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:16.161
HAVE THE MANAGED CARE MEDI CAL

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:17.362
WHICH IS BEEN GIVEN OVER THE

02:12:17.429 --> 02:12:19.164
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:20.632
WANT ONE MORE SYSTEM X. ABOUT

02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:22.634
LOW RATES AND YOU SAY MANAGED

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:24.436
CARE YOU MEAN THOUGH LIKE THE

02:12:24.503 --> 02:12:27.939
COUNTY POWER MANAGE CARE THE

02:12:28.006 --> 02:12:30.242
IT'S THE IT'S THE A MILD TO

MODERATE- YOUTH WHO ARE. QUOTE

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:36.548
MILD AMOUNT. INTERNALS OF FOR

02:12:36.615 --> 02:12:38.650
MEDI. AND THE U. COMMERCIAL

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:40.652
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE A LOT

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:42.788
OF THOSE PLANS THAT'S UNDER THE

02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:44.022
MANAGER ON TRUCKS WITH THE

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:46.425
RIGHT. WITH WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:48.260
OF MANAGED CARE PARTNER OF

THEIR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

02:12:52.064 --> 02:12:54.666
OF THE COUNTY'S HANDLE IT STAB

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:56.301
SYSTEM THAT BREAKDOWN IS

02:12:56.368 --> 02:13:01.239
HANDLE. THAT HAS THE LARGER WAS

02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:02.674
A TERROR ATTACK. OKAY TWELVE

02:13:02.741 --> 02:13:08.080
YEARS OF. HOW ABOUT THE COUNTY

02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:09.448
MENTAL HEALTH MANAGED CARE

02:13:09.514 --> 02:13:12.150
SYSTEMS THE PART OF THE MEDIC

02:13:12.217 --> 02:13:13.085
YOU CONSIDER THAT PART OF THE

02:13:13.151 --> 02:13:17.289
MEDICAL SYSTEM RIGHT YES OKAY-

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:19.725
DO DO YOU FEEL THAT-

02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:22.361
FINANCIALLY. AS WE HAVE THE

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:24.096
PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED ABOUT

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:27.099
CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT. WE'RE

02:13:27.165 --> 02:13:28.500
CATCHING PEOPLE TO LAY THE

02:13:28.567 --> 02:13:30.168
YOUNG KIDS TOO LATE RIGHT DO

02:13:30.235 --> 02:13:31.737
YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND WHAT

02:13:31.803 --> 02:13:33.739
CAN YOU KIND OF TALK ABOUT THE

02:13:33.805 --> 02:13:36.641
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IN TERMS

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:37.876
OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:39.845
OPERATE- I CAN GIVE A AN

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:41.913
EXAMPLE REAL QUICKLY- IN

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:43.648
ADDITION TO JUST THE SUFFERING

02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:46.151
WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE-

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:47.452
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE COST OF

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:49.988
HOSPITALIZATION. TWO THREE DAYS

02:13:50.055 --> 02:13:50.922
OF HOSPITALIZATION OVER

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:52.557
HOSPITALIZATION EPISODES

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:54.593
IMPATIENT OF EPISODE MAYBE

02:13:54.659 --> 02:13:56.328
EQUIVALENT TO MAYBE FIVE TO

02:13:56.395 --> 02:13:57.229
SEVEN DAYS OF RESIDENTIAL

02:13:57.295 --> 02:13:59.398
TREATMENT MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO

02:13:59.464 --> 02:14:01.199
A FULL MONTH OF INTENSIVE IN

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:03.468
HOME THERAPY SERVICES SO WHEN

02:14:03.535 --> 02:14:04.503
YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THE COST

02:14:04.569 --> 02:14:07.372
EFFECTIVENESS. ARE IN INPATIENT

02:14:07.439 --> 02:14:09.007
UNITS ARE TELLING US OTHER FULL

02:14:09.074 --> 02:14:10.375
THERE'S A LOT OF RECIDIVISM

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:11.777
BECAUSE THEY'RE STRUGGLING IN

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:13.945
BEING ABLE TO PLACE YOU WITH

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:15.447
THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:16.615
SO AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY'RE

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:18.083
COMING BACK AND GETTING SOME OF

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:19.985
THE MORE SIGNIFICANT- GUN

02:14:20.051 --> 02:14:21.520
CLOSELY TYPES OF TREATMENTS

02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:22.788
WHAT'S HAPPENING EMERGENCY

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:24.289
DEPARTMENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:25.924
ADDRESS BEFORE IS VERY

02:14:25.991 --> 02:14:26.758
SIGNIFICANT AND VERY VERY

02:14:26.825 --> 02:14:28.727
COSTLY. HE WE WERE ABLE TO

02:14:28.794 --> 02:14:29.895
EXPAND THIS CONTINUUM AND MAKE

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:32.330
IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO BE

02:14:32.397 --> 02:14:32.898
ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:35.066
SCARE NOT ONLY IT WILL BE

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:36.568
BETTER FOR THE FAMILY FOR THE

02:14:36.635 --> 02:14:37.436
YOUTH BUT HE WILL ALSO BRING

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:39.271
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS WHICH IS A

02:14:39.337 --> 02:14:40.839
LOT OF THE MOTIVATION. BELIEVE

02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:42.340
US TO US WE'RE ALSO HAVING

02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:43.475
CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMERCIAL

02:14:43.542 --> 02:14:45.343
INSURANCE TO OPEN UP THIS WHOLE

02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:47.245
AREA BECAUSE THERE IS A SENSE

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:48.079
OF THIS COULD BE VERY COST

02:14:48.146 --> 02:14:50.115
EFFECTIVE. THE RIGHT NOW RIGHT

02:14:50.182 --> 02:14:53.251
NOW ALL OF THE MIDDLE HEALTH

02:14:53.318 --> 02:14:57.189
SYSTEM. I MIGHT. IS OR IS NOT

02:14:57.255 --> 02:14:59.991
TOWARDS. KIDS IS MORE OR AND

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:01.159
TOWARDS ADULTS WOULD YOU AGREE

02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:02.828
WITH THAT STATEMENT YES OKAY

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:05.730
SO- THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS

02:15:05.797 --> 02:15:08.266
ORIENTED TOWARDS. WAITING UNTIL

02:15:08.333 --> 02:15:09.968
THEY BECOME ADULTS IF YOU WANT

02:15:10.035 --> 02:15:11.636
TO SET THAT WAY AND THEN.

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:14.306
PROVIDING THROUGH THE COUNTY

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:17.843
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. MEDI CAL

02:15:17.909 --> 02:15:20.212
OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES- AND

02:15:20.278 --> 02:15:21.079
MAYBE THROUGH THE ADULT

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:23.348
INSURANCE PROCESS OTHER KINDS

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:24.483
OF SERVERS WE DON'T CATCH THE

02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:28.019
CHILDREN WHILE THEY'RE IN

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:31.256
SCHOOL OR OR- BECAUSE OF THIS

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:33.458
THE ISSUES WE HAVE THE PREVIOUS

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:34.759
PANEL STIGMA ALL THOSE KINDS

02:15:34.826 --> 02:15:38.997
OF. THE ROOM THE RACIAL OF

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:41.333
DISPARITIES SO- ETHNIC

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:43.401
DISPARITIES ISSUE ALL THOSE

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:47.072
KINDS OF ISSUES. WHAT WHAT

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:52.110
WOULD YOU SAY IF WE TOOK MORE A

02:15:52.177 --> 02:15:55.480
OF OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM AND MAYBE

02:15:55.547 --> 02:15:57.983
RE RE RE INVIGORATED THE

02:15:58.049 --> 02:16:00.385
CHILDREN'S PART OF IT HOW WOULD

02:16:00.452 --> 02:16:01.887
YOU HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT

02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:04.623
DOING THAT. A INTERFERE A FULL

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:06.358
OF THINGS AND I'M SURE THAT

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:07.859
STEVE HAS SOME IDEAS AS WELL

02:16:07.926 --> 02:16:10.295
YEAH- FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:11.363
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE MORE

02:16:11.429 --> 02:16:13.298
TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO THE

02:16:13.365 --> 02:16:14.165
MENTAL HEALTH ATTEMPTING TO BE

02:16:14.232 --> 02:16:16.568
VERY KLEIN TO INDIVIDUAL CENTER

02:16:16.635 --> 02:16:17.435
WHICH IS THE ADULT MODEL

02:16:17.502 --> 02:16:18.870
SYMPTOM REDUCTION ALSO THE OF

02:16:18.937 --> 02:16:20.438
THE OLD MODEL. CHILDREN LEAVING

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:21.940
FAMILIES FOR HOPEFULLY THE

02:16:22.007 --> 02:16:23.775
BELIEVE IT IN IN FAMILIES IT

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:25.143
HAS TO BE A FAMILY CENTRED

02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:27.178
APPROACH SO WHAT ONE OF THE

02:16:27.245 --> 02:16:28.046
THINGS THAT THAT TENDS TO

02:16:28.113 --> 02:16:29.347
HAPPEN I THINK THE SOMETIMES

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:31.783
THE BENEFITS ARE CONCEIVED- AND

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:32.918
THEN WE PROVIDERS NEED TO

02:16:32.984 --> 02:16:34.519
FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE

02:16:34.586 --> 02:16:35.253
THEM. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.822
CARE IF WE COULD LOOK AT MODELS

02:16:37.889 --> 02:16:38.857
THAT REALLY ALLOWS TO

02:16:38.924 --> 02:16:40.058
EFFECTIVELY CARE FOR THE YOUTH

02:16:40.125 --> 02:16:41.426
AND THE FAMILIES AND THEN

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:43.228
IDENTIFY HOW TO TAKE THE

02:16:43.295 --> 02:16:44.963
BENEFITS AND BE ABLE TO REALLY

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:47.165
HELP SUPPORT THAT. TO BE ABLE

02:16:47.232 --> 02:16:49.100
TO- MAKE IT COST EFFECTIVE THAT

02:16:49.167 --> 02:16:50.569
COULD GO A LONG WAY BUT WE

02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:52.070
WOULD SAY THAT FAMILIES CENTER

02:16:52.137 --> 02:16:54.306
IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND ALSO

02:16:54.372 --> 02:16:55.974
WE BELIEVE THAT INTEGRATION

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:57.108
THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WERE

02:16:57.175 --> 02:16:59.311
FINING WITH PRIMARY CARE IN

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.279
PEDIATRIC OFFICES IT'S ALSO

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:02.147
VERY IMPORTANT THE OTHER

02:17:02.213 --> 02:17:03.882
COMPONENT IS. OF COURSE WITH

02:17:03.949 --> 02:17:05.584
SCHOOLS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING

02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:07.385
THAT SO THAT THE COMBINATION OF

02:17:07.452 --> 02:17:09.154
THOSE FACTORS TOGETHER PROBABLY

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:14.459
COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:15.226
YOU KNOW ONE THE THINGS THAT'S

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:16.394
INTERESTING TO ME HIS LOOK AT

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:19.264
THE DATA. THE REDUCTION OF USE

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:21.333
IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

UP IN OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN YOU

02:17:40.585 --> 02:17:41.786
LOOK AT THE DATA IN THE CHILD

02:17:41.853 --> 02:17:44.556
WELFARE SYSTEM AND THAT'S ALSO

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:46.458
DECLINING THEY'VE HAD SOME REAL

02:17:46.524 --> 02:17:48.660
GOOD SUCCESS WITH COMMUNITY

02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:50.862

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:52.831
CATION TYPE SERVICES THAT THEY

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:55.300

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:57.002
ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR THEIR

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:58.737

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:27.565
REAL STRESS ANXIETY ON THE PART

02:18:27.632 --> 02:18:29.200

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:07.231
DISPARITIES AND SERVICES. AND

02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:09.333
AS A PARENT OF A YOUNG BLACK

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:12.403
MAN YOUNG BOY WHO WAS IN SCHOOL

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.672
I A CAN SPEAK TO THAT BEING A

02:25:14.739 --> 02:25:16.808
STATISTIC IN TERMS OF THE- BOYS

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:18.176
OF COLOR BEING SUSPENDED AND

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:19.877
EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL AT HIGHER

02:25:19.944 --> 02:25:21.579
RATES THAN THEIR COUNTER THEIR

02:25:21.646 --> 02:25:23.481
WHITE COUNTERPARTS. FOR SOME OF

02:25:23.548 --> 02:25:25.516
THE SAME OFFENSES. AND ONE OF

02:25:25.583 --> 02:25:26.751
THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:27.852
THAT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE IN

02:25:27.919 --> 02:25:29.087
HELPING THAT IS REALLY A

02:25:29.153 --> 02:25:29.987
PREVENTION AND EARLY

02:25:30.054 --> 02:25:32.023
INTERVENTION- MODEL IS ALSO

02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:33.791
EVIDENCE BASED. AND IT'S CALLED

02:25:33.858 --> 02:25:34.859
MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION

02:25:34.926 --> 02:25:36.060
WHICH IS ACTUALLY DONE AT THE

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:37.995
PRESCHOOL LEVEL BECAUSE THE

02:25:38.062 --> 02:25:39.931
SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION RATES

02:25:39.997 --> 02:25:42.400
START THAT EARLY. AND IT

02:25:42.467 --> 02:25:44.268
ADDRESSES THE SYSTEM AS OPPOSED

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:45.803
TO- NECESSARILY PUTTING

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:48.372
CHILDREN SERVICES. EIGHT

02:25:48.439 --> 02:25:50.007
THERAPISTS OUR CLINICIANS ARE

02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:53.544
BROUGHT INTO THE- A SCHOOL

02:25:53.611 --> 02:25:54.679
SETTING BUT THERE'D BE HEADS

02:25:54.745 --> 02:25:56.981
PROGRAMS OR HATEVER. TO

02:25:57.048 --> 02:25:58.883
EDUCATE THE PROVIDERS TO

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:00.485
PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS ON

02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:02.053
BEHAVIORS THAT THEY MAY BE

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.121
SEEING IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM

02:26:03.187 --> 02:26:05.123
SETTING. SO IT REALLY THE IN

02:26:05.189 --> 02:26:06.324
THE ADDRESS IS THE SYSTEM WHICH

02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:07.458
I THINK IS REALLY WHAT WILL

02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:08.960
HELP TO DEAL WITH DISPARITIES

02:26:09.026 --> 02:26:12.330
IN THAT WAY. AND WHAT I'M

02:26:12.396 --> 02:26:13.831
NOTICING IS THAT WITH THE

02:26:13.898 --> 02:26:16.334
MANAGED CARE MODEL THAT THAT

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:19.337
PART OF THIS OF INTERVENTION IS

02:26:19.403 --> 02:26:22.006
BEING CUT. BECAUSE THERE'S MORE

02:26:22.073 --> 02:26:24.041
OF A- EMPHASIS AT CONDITIONS

02:26:24.108 --> 02:26:26.310
BEING ABLE TO BUILD A MAN AND-

02:26:26.377 --> 02:26:28.079
MIL HEALTH CONSULTATION IS NOT

02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:28.713

THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:37.221
TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE IT'S A VERY

02:26:37.288 --> 02:26:39.991

UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT BUT I

02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:52.897

02:27:52.964 --> 02:27:54.765
DON'T SEE IS THE WAY THEY LOOK

02:27:54.832 --> 02:27:56.467
AT THINGS IS MAYBE A LITTLE

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:59.437
WRONG. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT

THE KID GETS WORSE AND WORSE

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:30.434
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST COST

02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:32.103
EFFECTIVE THING SHE CAN

APPROACH. WHERE WE'RE GOING

02:30:57.348 --> 02:30:59.250
FROM THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES

COMMUNITY DRIVEN. INITIATIVES

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:16.801
AND SUPPORTING THOSE AS OPPOSED

02:31:16.867 --> 02:31:19.303
TO KIND OF TOP DOWN MAYBE FROM

02:31:19.370 --> 02:31:19.870
THE OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:21.872
PROJECTS. WELL IN THE REGULAR

02:31:21.939 --> 02:31:23.441
GOOD POINT BECAUSE I THINK WE

02:31:23.507 --> 02:31:25.476
HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY FOR

02:31:25.543 --> 02:31:27.011
GOING TO BE FAMILY ORIENTED. SO

02:31:27.077 --> 02:31:29.313
WE HOW EVERYBODY'S EVERY AREA

02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:29.814
HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF

02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:32.216
DYNAMICS. IT TAKES A LOT OF

02:31:32.283 --> 02:31:34.718
INPUT AND DISCUSSION. AT THE

02:31:34.785 --> 02:31:36.720
LOCAL LEVEL I HOPE THAT THIS.

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:39.356
NEW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE TASK

02:31:39.423 --> 02:31:41.725
FORCE. THAT WERE STARTED WILL

02:31:41.792 --> 02:31:43.694
DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY OUT

02:31:43.761 --> 02:31:47.097
REACH. IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

02:31:47.164 --> 02:31:49.567
IN TERMS OF LISTENING. TWO

02:31:49.633 --> 02:31:51.168
DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT WORK

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:52.937
IN CERTAIN AREAS AND DIFFERENT

02:31:53.003 --> 02:31:54.572
COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S-

02:31:54.638 --> 02:31:56.006
PROBABLY TRUE WITH THE BIG

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:57.675
STATE LIKE WE HAVE THAT THAT'S

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:59.777
PROBABLY THE CASE. WHAT WORKS

02:31:59.844 --> 02:32:01.479
IN SAN JOSE WHERE I'M FROM MY

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:05.516
NOT WORK AND- STOCKTON IT'LL-

02:32:05.583 --> 02:32:07.384
ABSENT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT NO.

02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:09.286
SO I THINK YOU I THINK IT'S

02:32:09.353 --> 02:32:10.521
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:12.690
THAT'S MY OPINION OKAY IS THERE

02:32:12.756 --> 02:32:14.625
ANY STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO HELP

02:32:14.692 --> 02:32:16.293
FACILITATE THAT OR TO MAKE SURE

02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:17.561
