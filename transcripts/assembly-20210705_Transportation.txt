TO SET A SIX SEVENTY FOUR BY DURAZO SENATOR DRAWS SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP AND YOUR GUIDANCE AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF- BASED ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND CONVERSATIONS ON GUIDANCE I'M ACCEPTING. ALL COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR APPROVED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REQUIRE THAT ALL TRANSPORTATION IN THE STATE BE POWERED BY CLEAN ENERGY IN A FEW SHORT YEARS. SINCE THAT TIME MANY HAVE CELEBRATED BUT A LOT OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE WONDERING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEIR JOBS IF THEY WORK IN A POWER PLANT AND OIL REFINERY YEAR. MANUFACTURING IF THE NEW JOBS OR OVERSEAS OR IF THEY PAY MINIMUM WAGES WITHOUT BENEFITS. PRESIDENT BIDEN AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME HAVE COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO CREATING GOOD JOBS BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW. HOW ARE GOOD JOBS GOING TO BE CREATED WHEN SOME COMPANIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY WILL FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO PROVIDE EVEN THE MOST BASIC GOOD JOB REQUIREMENTS. SB SIX SEVENTY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW WE WILL GET TO OUR GOAL. THE ENTIRE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT SIX SEVENTY SB SIX SEVENTY FOUR IS A CRUCIAL FIRST STEP FOR GETTING TO GOOD GREEN JOBS. SB SIX SEVENTY FOUR WILL SUPPORT EQUITABLE HIGH QUALITY TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED MANUFACTURING JOBS IN OUR STATE AND COUNTRY AND WILL ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE TRANSITION TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INCLUDE. GOOD WAGES QUALITY JOBS AND ESPECIALLY FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LEFT OUT. THIS BILL FOCUSES ON CREATING QUALITY CLIMATE RESILIENT JOBS WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS LAST YEAR'S AB THREE NINETY EIGHT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. OF PUTTING GOOD FOR THE CALIFORNIA THE HIGH ROAD OF GOODS AND OUR JOBS AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY. IDENTIFIES GOODS MOVEMENT AND MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AS THE BIGGEST SINGLE CONTRIBUTOR OF POLLUTION. I ALSO SAID AT THE SAME TIME THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM UNDERPINS OUR ECONOMY. THE FREE SYSTEM MOVES TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GOODS EACH YEAR SUPPORTING NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE STATE ECONOMY AND MORE THAN FIVE MILLION JOBS. THAT IS WHY PARTNERSHIPS WITH BUSINESS CAN LEAD TO PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE. THE CALIFORNIA JOBS PLAN AND US JOBS PLAN OR COMPONENT OF AN APPLICATION SUBMITTED BY APPLICANTS FOR COVERED PUBLIC CONTRACT A CONTRACT. THAT SPECIFIES THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF JOBS PROPOSED WAGES BENEFITS INVESTMENT IN TRAINING AND TARGETED HIRING UP PLANS. THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY WILL WORK WITH RELEVANT PUBLIC AGENCIES TO DESIGN THE CRITERIA THAT WILL BE USED FOR SCORING THESE ELEMENTS. THE JOBS PLAN COMPONENT WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW MINIMUM COMMITMENTS OTHER THAN THOSE ALREADY REQUIRED BY RELEVANT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. THE PROCEDURES IN SYRIA WILL AWARD ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO APPLICANTS. BUT WILL NOT BE WAITED HIGHER THAN 15% OF THE OVERALL SCORE- SCORE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY MEET THE GOALS OF OUR OWN CALIFORNIA FUTURE WORK COMMISSION MADE UP OF BUSINESSES COMMUNITY AND LABOR TO CREATE INCLUSIVE LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE NEED CLEAR COMMITMENTS TO QUALITY JOB CREATION AND PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PROMISES MADE IN OUR CONTRACTS WE WILL MOVE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF THESE GOOD JOBS. AND ENSURE PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO GIVE ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE WHO NEED THE JOBS TODAY WE HAVE MELANIE TO MILA PRASAD FROM JOBS TO MOVE AMERICA- AS A WITNESS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT.

OF THE BILL AS IT WILL SOON BE AMENDED I CERTAINLY MUCH IMPROVED- BUT THAT SENATE NOT WITHSTANDING I'M HERE TO VOTE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE BILL I DON'T TO BE CLEAR WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON IT AT THIS TIME. THE BILL ISSUE YOU HEARD REQUIRES TRANSIT AGENCIES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO CONTRACTORS IN A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT THAT PROMISED PROGRESS ON VARIOUS JOB METRICS- THESE PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY WELL INTENDED REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT AND THEN TESTED GOING UP THE PROCUREMENT POLICY THAT HAD TO DATE ONLY BEEN TRIAL BY SEVERAL PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH MUCH NARROWER PARAMETERS AND TO BE SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THE U. S. EMPLOYMENT PLAN U. S. B. P. THE MODEL FOR THIS LEGISLATION HAS ONLY. BEEN APPLIED TO BE A PROCUREMENT. CONGRESS DISCUSSES FORMALIZING YOU. THEY'VE ALSO CHOSEN TO KEEP AT THE- ON. PARKED HERE. BOB I CAN. THIS BILL TO CONTRACT. TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH IS DEFINED ONLY BY SHORTLISTED EXCLUSION. BECAUSE SUCH POLICY IS UNTESTED. WE DON'T KNOW-STATE MIGHT IMPACT THE SIDE THAT BEAT GOALS CREATE NEW CHALLENGES FOR MEDIUM AND SMALL STATE AGENCY. THAT NEW GROUNDS FOR PETROL TESTER LITIGATION OR DRIVE UP PROJECT COSTS. THESE ARE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE TRANSIT AGENCY THAT THE LEGISLATURE MUST EXAMINE AND THAT MAY NOT BE COUNTERACTED BY THE CREATION JOBS. WELCOME TO THE BILL IMPACTS STREAMLINED PROCUREMENT POLICY- THAT THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED. IMPACTING THE BILL THE LEGISLATURE WHEN AFFECT CONVERT THESE PROCUREMENT POLICIES. THE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT. THAT WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT DISCUSSION ON THAT POTENTIALLY SEISMIC CHANGE TO PROCUREMENT LAW. FINALLY THE BILL WAITING TO CONGRESS TO DEMAND BY EXPLICITLY CREATING NEW REQUIREMENTS. FOR PROCUREMENT FUNDED BY FEDERAL FUNDS. THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL DOES INCLUDE A VARIETY STATE COURTS TO ENSURE CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL LAW. BUT IT COULD STILL LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT. AT THE BILL COULD ACTUALLY IN SOME CASES SHIFT JOB AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. IT MANUFACTURES AND OTHER STATES IMPOSE STRONGER U. S. JOHNSON WHICH FIGURES THAT ARE IN STATE MANUFACTURERS.

ELEVEN ONE ELEVEN ONE THE BILLS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU AND I SEE SENATOR GONZALEZ HERE. YOU MAY PROCEED ONE READY MA'AM. THANK YOU GOOD I WILL NOT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP SEVEN TWO SIX WHICH MAKES THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM MORE EQUITY FOCUSED. AND WILL REQUIRE A COLLABORATIVE INTERAGENCY PLANNING TO OFFICIALLY PROMOTE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FRAUD CALIFORNIANS. THIS ADVANCES EQUITY BY SPECIFYING THAT AT LEAST 50% OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM DOLLARS. BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES FIRST. REQUIRING DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THESE BENEFITS INCLUDE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO HELP GET THE WORST POLLUTING DIESEL POWERED MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD. AND PROJECTS THAT MAKE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SB SEVENTY SIX ALSO PLANS FOR THE FUTURE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION BY CREATING A SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY. WHICH WILL CRACK REQUIRE MULTIPLE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS. ASSISTING ALL TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY WILL TAKE A BROAD LOOK AT OUR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS EVALUATING THE ROLE OF NEAR ZERO EMISSIONS THE REDUCTION TRANSIT AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. ALONGSIDE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES REDUCING NOT ONLY GHGS BUT AIR POLLUTANTS. LASTLY I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE BOTH THE MODERNIZATION OF THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY ARE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF GHG EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTANTS. IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHICH I REPRESENT I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE READ ADDIS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY CONSULTING. AND MYLES MILLER ATTORNEY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE MR ODYSSEUS HERE IN PERSON WELCOME. JUST TALK IT'LL IT'LL GO THROUGH TO GET ON FOR YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS READ OUT US ON BEHALF OF CAL START THE STRONG SUPPORT TODAY AS A SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE MERITS OF THE BILL I THINK I'LL SPEND MY TIME TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM OUR MAY BE HEARING FROM HERE MOMENTARILY. WE'D LIKE TO ARGUE THAT SOME OF THAT OPPOSITION IS ACTUALLY SHOWING THAT THEY SUPPORT THE PROGRAM IT IT'S A CRITICAL PROGRAM TO OUR STATE AND HELPING US SCALE UP RB AT VARIOUS IN VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER THEY'RE BRINGING BAGGAGE TO THIS CONVERSATION LIKE WE ALL DO BASED ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PAST ACTIVITIES OR RECENTLY F THE AGENCY. AND WE THINK IT'S FAIR THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD ENTER THIS CONVERSATION THINKING ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE PROGRAM SO FAR. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR IN THEIR ASK THAT THE EXTREME CLARITY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IN THIS LEGISLATION IS AN APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PUSH FOR ANNABEL. AND EXTREME CLARITY LEAST IN OUR UNDERSTANDING IS TRYING TO GET DOLLAR AMOUNTS OR PERCENTAGES INTO THE BILL. THERE'S THREE CRITICAL REASONS WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM. ONE IT OPENS UP THE DOOR FOR ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO COME IN AND GET ITS CARVE OUT ITS SPECIAL PIECE OR ITS PERCENTAGE. TO ENFORCE IS THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIDE TRY TO PICK WINNERS. I WILL REMIND YOU WHEN THIS PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY AUTHORIZED EVERYBODY THOUGHT EVERY SINGLE DOLLARS SHOULD BE SPENT. ON CELLULOSIC ETHANOL AND THAT WASN'T THE CASE. AND IT WAS GOOD THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT PICK A WINNER. THIRD I THINK PEOPLE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY READ THE BILL OF WHAT SENATOR GONZALEZ HAS BEEN PUSHING AT THE C. P. P. PROGRAM. THE CIVIC FOR IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE TEN AND ELEVEN IT'S VERY CLEARLY LAYING OUT THAT HYDROGEN IS A KEY CRITICAL AND FOCAL POINT OF THIS PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. AS WELL AS LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE MILES MUELLER FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ON THE PHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE FIND- ME FIND. THEM. GOOD AFTERNOON GENEROUSLY IN. GO AHEAD. GREAT MY MOTHER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND ALSO TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE CHARGE AHEAD CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN- THE GOAL IS TO THE CLEAN AIR COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONENT ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA AND THE GREEN RUNNING INTO TO ALL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THIS BILL WOULD MODERNIZE THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION GREEN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM TO INCORPORATE THE LATEST STATE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND REMOTE TECHNOLOGY MUTUAL INVESTMENT IN PROJECTS THAT WOULD REDUCE HARMFUL CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS IN AIR TOXICS EMISSIONS OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES ARE WE SPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE STRONG EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE BILL THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING I WILL BENEFIT ARE DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THINGS LIKE REPLACING POLLUTING DIESEL VEHICLES WITH ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE AND A PLAIN PUBLICLY ACCEPTABLE REFUELING OR CHARGING STATION SERVING LONGER DOCUMENT BECAUSE ALL CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO HAVE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND CLEAN OUT THE WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE TO LISTEN. IN OPPOSITION. FIRST LET'S GO TO MARGOT PARKES FROM WITH SPOKE ON THE PHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE FIND MISS PARKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MARKUP HERE IS THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. I AM HERE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY IN THE POLLS AND THAT AMENDED POSITION ON. SEVEN TWENTY SIX. WELL WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ATTENTION REQUIRE CRACK AGENCIES TRANSPORTATION COORDINATION AND PLANNING ON THE PHONE. NUMBER OF THE POLICY IS UNFORTUNATELY OUTLINED THE BILL ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED PARTIALLY DEAF AND I THOUGHT THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING. IMMEDIATE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS WHICH RECENTLY SUPPORT AUTHOR AND- THE BILL ALLOWS AIR RESOURCES BOARD BOB COULTER TRANSPORTATION SECTOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION. OUTLINED IN THE NASDAQ THE COMMUNITY NATURE HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED BY THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. SECONDLY THAT THAT HAPPENED TRADE PROGRAM AND LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD REQUIRE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND FUEL TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND ADDITIONAL WALL COULD HAVE A HARMFUL EFFECT OF INCREASING PRICES TO CONSUMERS WITHOUT- DELIVERING ANY REAL BENEFIT. I WATER RECENTLY FOUND IN THE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES HAVE UNCLEAR METRIC THAT. SHOULD BE DOUBLE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING THE FOR DIRECTING AGENCIES. ABDUCTION BALL. SECONDLY UNFORTUNATELY THE FIGHT AND THINK THAT ROLE- AND HANDS AND MODIFICATIONS OF THE BILL WELL BELIEVE THE BALL. OF WAX IN IT CLEARLY ABOUT TECHNOLOGICALLY- MUTUAL ADVANCEMENT THE TRANSPORTATION. OF MONEY NOW THERE ARE MANY TECHNOLOGY TODAY THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT CAN PROVIDE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL DIRECTS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO MEET THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF ELIMINATING THE SALE OF NEW LIGHT DUTY. MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. BUT THEY'LL CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IN SUPPORT OF AIR QUALITY GOALS OUTLINED BY THE AUTHOR WITH THAT TYPE OF INCLUSION. AGAIN WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT TARGETS NEAR AND LONG TERM AIR QUALITY. IS IMPORTANT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL. IS THE TOP SLOT IN AT THE PRO. THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE UNFORTUNATELY WE BELIEVE SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX SHOULD INCLUDE DEDICATED AND PREDICTABLE FUNDING FOR LIGHT DUTIES THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND APPROPRIATE EXPENDITURE CONSIDERING THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM COMES FROM FEES PAID BY LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE OWNERS IN THE STATE. BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AUTOMAKERS WILL HAVE INVESTED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE INDUSTRY FUNDS FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION CURRENTLY WE OFFER FIFTY THREE DIFFERENT MODELS TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND THAT NUMBER WILL GROW TO OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MODELS IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. TO MEET THE GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER OF A TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AIR B. AS PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE. 86% OF NEW VEHICLE SALES BEES AS BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT CURRENT THAT SALES MISS TRIPLE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WILL NOT BY IS THAT IF THEY CAN'T REFUEL THEM INDEED WERE ALREADY LOSING GROUND BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF THE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE. RESEARCHERS AT UC DAVIS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SWITCH BACK. TO INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES BECAUSE OF THE INCONVENIENCE OF CHARGING. AND AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE STATE AND FAILED TO MEET ITS CURRENT GOALS FOR ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN LIGHT DUTY REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AT A TIME CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE INVESTING MORE IS PROPOSING TO DO LAST AND IS DOING SO ON THE BACKS OF LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE OWNERS BY REQUIRING THEIR FEES TO SUBSIDIZE MEDIUM. AND HEAVY DUTY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS MARKET NEED CERTAINTY CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS NEED CERTAINTY. AND WHAT MR ADDIS CALLED BAGGAGE ALL COLFAX CURRENTLY THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS PROPOSING ZERO DOLLARS FOR LIGHT DUTY INTERMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WORDS IN THE BILL LIKE INCREASING DON'T INSPIRE CONFIDENCE. IT'S FOR THIS REASON THAT WE BELIEVE SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX SHOULD BE AMENDED TO REQUIRE THAT. UNTIL THE STATE'S GOALS ARE MET AT LEAST 50% OF THE FUNDS IN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THE ALLOCATED THE LIGHT DUTIES EVERY FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE TO YOUR RESUME YOU COULD. I WAS JUST GOING TO CONCLUDE FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSING LESS AMENDED AT THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE.

I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THANK YOU CENTER I'D CERTAINLY- DO APPRECIATE HER TENURE WORK- IN THIS SPACE ESPECIALLY COMMITMENTS INVESTING- AND MEDIUM AND HEAVY% DUTY VEHICLES- I THINK YOU AND I WERE SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER WHEN WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING IN REGARDS TO- THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT- ON CARBS PROGRAM METRICS AND EFFECTIVENESS THIS BILL CERTAINLY DOES DIRECT CARP TO DO MORE- I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GET YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF DO YOU HAVE. ON THE CONCERNS THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ON AND GIVING BACK GIVING CARBODIES AUTHORITY- WITH JUST THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND IT'S KIND OF LAPSE IN ITS ABILITY TO KIND OF- YOU THE DATA AND MANAGEMENT. OF EXISTING PROGRAMS. YES THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR I PROCEED AND YES WE WERE AT THE SAME HEARING TOGETHER- AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HER THE SAME INFORMATION ABOUT THIS. THIS DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE AUTHORITY AND THAT THE- STRATEGY IN THE PLAN THAT WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THEY MAY CONSIDER AND WE'VE AMENDED THE LANGUAGES THEY SHALL CONSIDER. IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT- INCLUDING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A OR B. TO DO SO. WE'VE AMENDED IT TO ADDRESS THAT ANDQUITE HONESTLY WE'VE AMENDED A LOT OF THE BILL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS WHICH I CAN- EXPLAIN MY CLOTHES AS WELL SURE. AND THEN IF IS DOES THE HYDROGEN COALITION IS STILL IN. THE CHAMBERS. OVER THERE. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION. SORRY I DON'T WANNA MAKE YOU RUN ACROSS THE PLATE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER MICHAEL VISIT. BUT IF YOU START ASKING HOUSING- SO INTO THAT SAID ACTION COALITION- YEAH THE AUTHOR WAS IT WAS VERY FIRM AND HER- IN HER OPENING THAT THIS. BILL DOES REMAIN TECH NEUTRAL SO. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS HOW IS YOUR INTERPRETATION. DIFFERENT OR HOW DO YOU GET TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I BELIEVE THAT THE- SPONSORS AND THE AUTHORS. I HAVE TRIED VERY HARD. TO CHANGE THE VERBIAGE IN THE BILL SUCH THAT IT IS IN THE SPIRIT OF TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY. BUT BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS THE PRIMARY PROGRAM FOR FUNDING HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE HEAVY DUTY AND LIGHT DUTY SPACES IF WE'RE GOING TO REFOCUS THE PROGRAM TO HEAVY DUTY. INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE REMAINING LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. AND IF THAT ISN'T ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL TO THE TUNE OF PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THAT THOUSAND STATIONS IN THE FUNDING THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE BASICALLY REMAIN STRANDED AT TWO HUNDRED STATIONS. OKAY ICE I CERTAINLY WILL ALLOW THE- THE OTHERS ONE NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS NOW THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND ABSOLUTELY I'D LOVE TO RESPOND TO THAT- AND THIS IS THE SAME WE WERE CREATING THE SAME PARTY LANGUAGE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONFUSION IS BECAUSE WE'D LIKE TO CLEAR TAT UP THE SAME PARTY LANGUAGE FOR LIGHT DUTY AS WE ARE FOR MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY SO THERE'S NO- YOU KNOW. FOCUSING MORE ON ON MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY. AND AGAIN I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TECH NEUTRAL- WE'VE- STATED THAT VERY CLEARLY IN THE LANGUAGE- AND IT DOESN'T TOUCH THE EXISTING 20% CARVE OUT FOR HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AS IT STANDS- IT ALSO ADDS IN REFERENCE TO THE STATE'S HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY IN EXISTING LAW. THAT'S NOT A MERRILEES ADDED THAT. SB SEVENTY SIX ACTUALLY ALSO HAS THE SUPPORT OF OEMS- SO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS LIKE NICOLA. THAT MANUFACTURE HYDROGEN VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN USERS LIKE SOME LINE. SO WE DO HAVE THAT ARE IN OUR SUPPORT COALITION AS WELL. I THINK THAT WAS MY QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SEEING NONE- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN I THINK YOU AND THE- COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AS WELL AND ALL OF THE GREAT QUESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THEM AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING TO A GOOD PLACE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE- WHO THE PICK PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AS ONE OF MY- SUPPORT- TESTIMONY. A WITNESSES MENTIONED AND WE WANT TO ADDRESS EQUITY FIRST YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN BURDENED WITH AIR POLLUTION AND WITH GHG AND THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR US TO ACT SO BY. SAYING THAT THE EQUITY FIRST AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FIRST I THINK IS THE SPIRIT OF THIS- AND LEAVING THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT ACCORDINGLY- SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL BUT I'M CERTAINLY OPEN FOR. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK WITH WITH MY COMMITTEE AND ON ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS BUT MOSTLY I APPRECIATE THE FOCUS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON AIR QUALITY ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED. BY POLLUTION FROM THE SECTOR AND- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY HAVE A CHAMPION AND THEY HAVE THAT IN USE SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS GREAT WORK WITH THAT OFFICE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN HI FONG. NO PHONE NO BERMAN BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO. WELL OKAY THEN. SORRY SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU I PROCEED PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY OKAY GREAT- THE MANAGER MEMBERS A FIVE FIVE ONE. THE MY SENATE BILLS HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY AT FIRST I WANT TO JUST ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS- FROM THE COMMITTEE NOTED ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS THESE REFLECT BOTH COMMITMENTS I MADE LAST WEEK IN ASSEMBLY ACCOUNTABILITY TO MINISTRY TO REVIEW TO ENSURE THE BILL IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND THAT. THE HYDROGEN REFUELLING GOALS WERE ALSO INCLUDED ALONGSIDE YOUR MISSION- ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION GOALS- FAMILIES WOULD REMOVE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION- FROM THE HYDROGEN CAN HYDROGEN COMMUNITY AND THEN THE IMMENSE ALSO MEET THIS COMMITTEES EXPECTATION THAT THE SEVENTH ALREADY WORKED. WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY WHEN REPORTING ITS PROGRESS ON INDUSTRY AND JOB GROWTH IN THIS SECTOR SO IN SHORT THIS THIS BILL NOW WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE AUTHORITY WITHIN GO BIZ. BUT AS A INDEPENDENT OPERATING BODY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY TO THIS LEGISLATURE- WITH EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP AND WITH CLEAR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WE CAN HOLD THE- NOT JUST THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT OUR OUR OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO AND KNOW WHERE WE STAND IN TERMS OF REACHING OUR AGGRESSIVE TRANSPORTATION GOALS. MEMBERS WE ARE LIVING IN IT CONTROL THE M. STATE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ALSO THE HOME OF. THE CLEAN CAR CAPITAL OF THE WORLD OUR LARGEST EXPORT- WERE LIT WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES LAST YEAR- BUT WE ARE ALSO THE LARGEST CONSUMER OF PETROLEUM ON THE ENTIRE PLANET SO WE ARE BOTH THE HOME OF PROGRESS. IN THE PLACE WHERE MOST PROGRESS NEEDS TO BE MADE AND I BELIEVE THERE'S EVER THIRTY THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ESTABLISH WOULD. PUT OUT A MARKET SIGNAL AND SAY THEY WERE SERIOUS WHEN WE COME STORES OF POLICY ABOUT JOB CREATION NOT JUST- CONSUMPTION SO THIS IS ABOUT ATTRACTING. INVESTMENT ALL THE WAY UP STREAM- ALL THE WAY UP THE VALUE SUPPLY CHAIN INTO THINGS LIKE LITHIUM PRODUCTION AND MANUFACTURING- DOWN. TO DESERVE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF- THE CHOI A FUEL AS WELL AS- AND USES. SO HOPEFULLY- WE CAN START TO CHIP AWAY AND HAVE A ONE STOP SHOP IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT SAYS WHEN IT COMES IS YOUR MISSION VEHICLES CALIFORNIA IS VERY MUCH OPEN FOR BUSINESS- WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY REMOTELY OR MATT PETERSON THE PRESIDENT CEO VLE CLEANTECH INCUBATORS WELL AS- MICHAEL COLE THEN HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF REGULATORY LETTER FARES IT- THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR OPERATOR CAN WE PLEASE HAVE MISTER PETERSON. TWO MINUTES PLEASE. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE WITH ME THANK YOU- FOR YOUR TIME THIS AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIRMAN IT SET UP- GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU AND- JUST WANTED TO SPEND A COUPLE MINUTES SPEAKING TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL- WE- INTRODUCED THE BELL- I WAS THE OUTCOME OF OUR TRANSPORTATION WHAT TRADITION PARTNERSHIP WHICH WE FORMED. WITH THE MAYOR OF THE COUNTY- SO THE CALIFORNIA EDISON DEPART WATER POWER CENTRO- AND AIR RESOURCES BOARD. ALONG WITH OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND LABOR PARTNERS TO SET GOALS TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS- TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WHEN THE OLYMPICS COME TO LOS ANGELES AND- SO WE SET A NUMBER OF TARGETS IN AS WE DID THE WORK TO SEE HOW WE CAN LEADERS ORIGINALLY RECOGNIZED THE NEED AND OPPORTUNITY. TO FIND SOLUTIONS- AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL. AND REALLY OUT OF THE THINKING AND- HARD WORK THAT THE TEAM EVERYBODY DID- PUT FORTH THIS IDEA. OR WHAT IS NOW THESE ARE MISSIONS- VEHICLE AUTHORITY AT THE STATE. TO REALLY SEE HOW WE CAN TAKE A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH- TO MEETING OUR STATE SCHOOLS THAT SET FORTH MOST RECENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- AND REALLY AS WE MOVE TOWARDS GOING FROM- A MODEST LEVEL OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES BEING SOLD COMPARED TO A 100% ALL CARS TO BE SOLD TO BE ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND HAVING ALL THE TRAITS TRUCKS TWENTY A TO BE ZERO EMISSIONS. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE REALLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR A LITTLE LEADERSHIP AND A COUPLE OF EVERY AGENCY OF COURSE ACCOUNTABLE BUT TO FIND WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH PRIVATE SECTOR LABOR- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS AND HENCE THE BILL PARTY THAT TO OUR OUR GOOD FRIEND AND AUTHOR SENATOR HENRY STERN'S INTRODUCED IMPORTANT PARTY TODAY YOUR TILES ALSO WORK AND FINISH UP PLEASE. THANK YOU BUT WE'RE JUST PREACHING YOUR CONSIDERATION- FIND THAT THIS WILL NOT ONLY ADDRESS MEETING THE GOALS- BY BY FINDING FUNDING AND FINANCING TOOLS BUT ALSO. REALLY MAKING SURE WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OP ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN PREPARE A WORK FORCE FOR THIS TRANSITION THAT IS. UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION AS WELL OKAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH OKAY WE HAVE MICHAEL COLE THEN PLEASE. YES HI GOOD AFTERNOON- TRIP CREEP IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN COURT SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE ONE. FIVE THREE TRUCKS AND OTHER MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE A HUGE PART OF OUR TEACHING EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION. THE VEHICLE TO NOT OPERATE UNIFORMLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT RATHER THEY'RE CONCENTRATED ALONG THE HIGHWAYS AND- WE KEEP THOSE. MOBILE SOURCES- THOUGHTFUL FUEL FOR POWER THAT AND- ARE THE LARGEST CONTRBUTOR TO THE FORMATION OF THOSE ON GHG EMISSIONS AND FINE PARTICULATE MATTER AND TOXIC MUSEL. PARTICULAR MATTER IN CALIFORNIA. MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY. MAKE UP A SMALL SIGNIFICANT BECOME EXCUSE ME THINK OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA DESPITE THIS MAKING UP 7% OF THE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. CALIFORNIA HAS THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO COMBINE TWO OF ITS PRESSING ISSUES DURING THE- TIME TO LOOK AT PROGRAMS THAT WILL NEED. YOU TO GO TYPE OF PRETTY PINK HAIR AND KIND OF POLLUTION. LIKELY WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO CONVERT THESE DIRTY VEHICLES TOOK PORTABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE CARE MISSION OPTIONS. GETTING THE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD WILL TAKE A SUITE OF POLICIES FROM INSURING THE VEHICLES ARE AVAILABLE THE DETERMINATION THE FEELING AVAILABILITY SUCH AS CHARTERS AND OTHER OPTIONS. YOU'LL RATE THAT WILL KEEP THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP LOW. THE AUTHORITY ENVISIONED IN SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE ONE CAN BE THE QUARTERBACK FOR ALL OF THESE POLICIES. I PREVIOUSLY SPOKE TO THIS CAN BE ABOUT THE CRITICAL NEED TO CREATE FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE CAPITAL TO HELP EMPLOYEES ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THE CREATION OF THE AUTHORITY ENVISIONED IN SB FIVE FIVE ONE WILL PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN COORDINATING THE STACKING OF DIFFERENT FUNDS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. THE GOAL TO GET THE LARGEST THING FOR THE PUBLIC BALKED POSSIBLE. THE AUTHORITY INVENTION IN FIVE FIVE ONE WILL ALSO GET LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES COORDINATED WITH ALL OF THE GREAT STATE LEVEL EFFORTS BUT BOBBY HAS BEEN AWAY. THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION WILL BE CRITICAL TO HELP GET THINGS AND STOCK WE KNOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY ABOUT WHAT THAT WE DO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMEONE TO HELP GET THINGS GOING AND THE AUTHORITY IS A GREAT PLACE TO HAVE THAT CENTRALIZED ACTIVITY.

THANK YOU MANAGER THIS IS I WOULD SUBMIT THE WHILE THIS BILL YOU WILL HEAR. AT THIS SESSION- SB SEVEN NINETY. IT'S BOTH THE WILDLIFE BILL AND A TRANSPORTATION BILL BECAUSE- FOR THE FIRST TIME GOING TO INTEGRATE THE EFFORTS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND CALTRANS WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE SO THAT. WHEN WE'RE ADVANCING NEW TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WERE ALSO LOOKING AT. THE WILDLIFE THAT WE'RE CUTTING OFF AND WHAT KIND OF CONNECTIVITY WE EXPECT TO SEE IN THE FUTURE. SO GIVE DFW DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND DOT DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION THE ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY OFFER A NEW COMPENSATORY MITIGATION CREDIT TO HOPEFULLY FINANCED SOME OF THE CONNECTIVITY WERE HOPING FOR BEFORE THESE PROJECTS ACTUALLY GET BUILT. AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE OCCURS MEMBERS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE IN CALIFORNIA YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH SOME MASS EXTINCTION EVENT IN YOUR OWN NATIVE ECOLOGY WHETHER IT'S- TROUT OR SALMON OR- MOUNTAIN LIONS OR- OR- FLORA AND FAUNA- SO YOU KNOW IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN ENDANGERED. APEX PREDATOR THAT IS ON THE BRINK AND HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MANY DANGEROUS COLLISIONS AND DEATHS ON THE ROAD- AND WILDLIFE VEHICLE COLLISIONS ALONE FOR YOUR PURPOSES TODAY AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE SHOULD NOTE- THAT'S THREE HUNDRED INSTANCES A YEAR OF INJURY FIVE ESTIMATED DEATHS AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COSTS ANNUALLY- AND EVEN JUST ONE ADEQUATE CROSSING STRUCTURE OF SOME SORT. CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION WE'RE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT SOME OF THE ELEMENTS IN THE BUDGET THAT. TRY TO INTEGRATE BIODIVERSITY IS A CRITICAL PART OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY AND I THINK WE CAN MAKE BIG PROGRESS THIS YEAR SO WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND NOTE THAT- OUR SPONSORS THE- MAN MOUNTAINS RECREATION AND CONSERVATION AUTHORITY READ ADDIS I THINK IS ON THE LINE AS WELL AS BETH PRATT WITH THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND I HAVE READ ADDRESS AS BEING ONE OF THE LEAD WITNESSES MR ADDIS YOU MAY PERCEIVE ONE READY TO MINUTES. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ OUT OF SOMEBODY UP IN MID PENINSULA REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT AND SALAS STRONG SUPPORT HERE TODAY. WE ARE IN THE MIX ON THIS ISSUE IN OUR REGION. BOTH BECAUSE WE HAVE PROTECTED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES AND OPERATE TWENTY SIX OPEN SPACE PRESERVES. WHERE WE HAVE WILDLIFE AND PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES ALL THE TIME THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A TOOL THAT WE CAN USE IT ANYTIME ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. TO ALLOW AN INCENTIVE FOR CALTRANS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS. WE HAVE A CRITICAL PROJECT OURSELVES ON HIGHWAY SEVENTEEN THAT WERE WORKING ON. TO TRY TO CREATE BETTER CONNECTIVITY. UNDER HIGHWAY SEVENTEEN. AND JUST THIS LAST APRIL WE DID LOSE ABOUT LINE AT THAT VERY VERY OR- OUR HOPE IS THAT. THE THIS BILL PASSES IT PROVIDES THE TOOL TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS AND MANY OTHERS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INCENTIVE TO CALTRANS ALLOW CALTRANS TO HAPPILY PARTICIPATE THE IN THESE PROJECTS. AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE AREAS FOR WILDLIFE AND IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I AM ON THE PHONE WE SHOULD HAVE BETH PRATT FROM THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION OPERATOR. HELLO THIS IS BACKING ME YES. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS BETH PRATT FOR THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY AND I REALLY THINK SENATOR HENRY STERN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE WILDLIFE CORRIDOR ISSUES- PATIENTS ALL OF YOU'VE SPOKEN OR SINISTER ANOTHER SPOKE ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THE BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS. AND WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR THOSE REASONS BUT I'M GOING TO SPEAK FROM A VERY PERSONAL REASON BECAUSE YESTERDAY I PICKED A DYING BOBCAT OFF ONE OF OUR HIGHWAYS HERE- WHO'S BEEN HIT BY A CAR. AND WE ACTUAR WILL GET IN THE RESCUE AND HE'S FIGHTING BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WHERE THERE IS A SOLUTION WE DON'T NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. AND AS WE KNOW THE AMOUNT LINES IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT THEY ARE IN BREEDING THEMSELVES OUT OF EXISTENCE BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING HIT BY CARS IN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T ROAM FREELY SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE A SOLUTION FOR WE CAN DO IT IT HELPS HUMAN SAFETY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY GETS TO THE INCREDIBLE WILD HERITAGE ANDBIODIVERSITY WE NEED TO PRESERVE IN THE FACE OF SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE. I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO READ THE LA TIMES AND A REALLY WONDERFULLY WRITTEN ARTICLE ABOUT THE WILDLIFE CROSSING AT LIBERTY CANNON WHICH IS CLOSE QUICKLY BECOMING A REALITY AND I THINK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT AND IT REALLY TAKES A DEEP DIVE INTO WHY THESE ARE IMPORTANT BUT MOST OF ALL JUST HONOR THAT BOBCAT AND SO MANY OTHERS LIKE HIM WHO DON'T WIN AGAINST THESE CARS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE YES. THANK YOU MISS PRATT THAT WAS REAL REALLY POWER. AND COMPELLING STATEMENT I APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION ON FILE.

SURE GOOD AFTERNOON SURE FRIEDMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF SB SIXTY NINE. I'M CAROL HART A MEMBER OF THE NORTH COAST RAILROAD AUTHORITY AND HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH SENATOR MCGUIRE AND WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR STATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. TO TRANSFORM AN ENTIRELY OBSOLETE AND FULLY DYSFUNCTIONAL RAILROAD RIGHT OF WAY AND STATE AGENCY INTO AN INSPIRATIONAL AND TRANSFORMATIONAL ECONOMIC ENGINE AND HUGE RECREATIONAL DRAW NOT JUT TO THE NORTH COAST BUT FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. THE VISION OF THE GREAT REDWOOD TRAIL IS SIMPLE TAKE A RIGHT OF WAY THAT WAS RESERVED FOR A CENTURY. AND WHAT ALL AGREE HAVE NO HOPE OF EVER CARRYING RAIL AGAIN INCREASE THE LONGEST RAIL TRAIL IN THE COUNTRY AND I CAN SAY AS SOMEONE WHO IS WORKING THE PARKS FIELD FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THAT MUCH OF THE TRAIL WILL BE CREATED INEXPENSIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY BY GRADING THE EXTENT EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY. AND ADDING A WALKABLE WRITEABLE THRILLED SERVICE SIMILAR TO MUCH OF THE FIRST PACIFIC CREST REVELATION TRAILS IT IS USUALLY SUPPORTED BY THE CITIES AND TOWNS FROM SANTA ROSA WILL EUREKA THROUGH WHICH IT WILL RUN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES TO TI&lt;c.cyan&gt; ANSWERED&lt;/c&gt; HIKERS AND RIDERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. THEY MAKE THEIR WAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY TO HUMBOLDT BAY- THE- RIVER CANYON AND THE GREAT BUT REPORTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE TO THRESHOLD HERE AND WITH THE VISION OF SENATOR MCGUIRE AND ALL OF YOU AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION WE CAN FINALLY SEE THE END OF THIS FUNCTION AND THE NEEDLESS EXPENSE OF TRYING TO RESUSCITATE A FAILED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BUT INSTEAD AND BARK ON THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY VISION OF SUSTAINABILITY BY CREATING. THE GREAT REDWOOD TRAIL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE HAVE A COME. BY PHONE. TWO MINUTES PLEASE. OPERATOR. IT DOES LOOK LIKE MISS COLLINS DROP ONE MOMENT PLEASE. CURRENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE OR COLON CONNECTED WE DID HAVE IRVINE AND IT DROPPED OKAY IF SHE COMES BACK WILL ALLOW HER TO SPEAK AFTER THE OPPOSITION DO WE HAVE DAVID JOHN BYRNE FROM THE TRUMP BRING WRITERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE OPPOSITION PLEASE. RIGHT HERE- MADAM CHAIR TWO MINUTES PLEASE- I'M DAVID SCHOENBERG PRESIDENT OF THE TRAIN RIDERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IS SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON RAIL INVESTMENTS ALL OVER THE STATE. YET ON THE NORTH COAST CENTER MCGUIRE SEEKS TO HAVE THE STATE MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HE'S ASKING FOR A STORY TO RAIL BANK THESE ASSETS. THAT MEANS RIPPING OUT THE EXISTING TRACKS TO MAKE IT CHEAPER TO BUILD HIS TRAIL. WILDTRAK NOTES THE TREMENDOUS COST OF THE TRAIL DISPROPORTIONATE TO ITS TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS WE DO NOT FUNDAMENTALLY OBJECT TO IT TRAIL WE DO HOWEVER STRONGLY OBJECT TO RIPPING OUT THE RAILS. OUR ORGANIZATION IS SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE ON TRAINS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE GHG EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS PEOPLE NEED LOW CARBON WAYS OF TRAVEL WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD THROW AWAY A MAJOR STATE INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND TURN IT INTO MERE RECREATION. THESE CRACKS HAVE FUTURE UTILITY FOR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION IF SB SIXTY NINE IS APPROVED AND THE STATE EVENTUALLY DECIDES IT NEEDS TO RESTORE RAIL TRANSPORTATION TO THE NORTH COAST THAT WOULD REQUIRE MOVING THE TRAIL. IF YOU ALLOW IT TO BE BUILT WHERE THE TRACKS ARE NOW THAT WOULD COST MORE THAN THE SAVINGS THAT THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVE. MEMBERS SHOULD KNOW THAT HUMBOLDT COUNTY HAS BUILT QUITE A SYSTEM OF TRAILS ALONG SIDE THE REAL ROAD IT WASN'T A PROBLEM. WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE RAILS WITH TRAILS BUT WE VEHEMENTLY CRITICIZED THE FOOLHARDINESS. THE STATE NEEDS TO REDUCE GHGS FOR MOTOR VEHICLES YOU JUST HAD TO BILLS ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OPERATOR DO WE HAVE LARA CALLING BACK. WE DO HAVE A MISSED CALL ON ONLINE PLEASE GO AHEAD.
