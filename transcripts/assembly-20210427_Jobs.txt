THIS IS MY THIRD ATTEMPT TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE COMMISSION IT'LL- ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE ARE HOME TO THE GLOBAL LEADERS IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. IN A RECENTLY WE SAW THE NEWS ABOUT HOW. BUDGET PROPOSAL LABORATORY SUCCEEDED IN LANDING THE MARS ROVER ON THE PLANET MARS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A FEAST ON SHORTLY THIS FALL NORTHRUP GRUMMOND IS GOING TO LAUNCH INTO SPACE THE WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE. THAT THEY LIKE TO BRAG IS SO POWERFUL THAT THEY CAN SEE THE LIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME. AND OF COURSE WE ARE STILL HOME. TO SPACEX- OVER FOUR THOUSAND. HIGH PAYING MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE THEY ARE BUILDING. THE FALCONS IN THE DRAGON CAPSULES THAT THAT WE ARE ALL READING IN THE PAPERS. BUT I KNOW THAT AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY AEROSPACE SELECT COMMITTEE. THAT OTHER STATES ESPECIALLY TEXAS AND FLORIDA AND COLORADO ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO LEARN AWAY ARE- WONDERFUL AEROSPACE COMPANIES THAT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW OVER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GREAT PAYING MANUFACTURING JOBS- INTERSTATE. AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE PUBLIC PRIVATE. PARTNERSHIP LEADERSHIP- TO KEEP THESE GREAT PAYING JOBS THESE GREAT COMPANIES- NOT ONLY FOR THESE MARQUEE COMPANIES- LIKE SPACEX AND JPL. BUT ALSO THIS SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE MANUFACTURERS- THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT CONTINUES TO OPERATE- HERE IN OUR GREAT STATE. WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA TRAVEL AND TOURISM COMMISSION. WE SHOULD HAVE A CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE COMMISSION. SO I'D LIKE TO- INVITE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ALEX BY AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES AT UC BERKELEY. AND JUDY KRUEGER A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT THE LOS ANGELES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR UNDERSTAND WE HAVE DR BIDEN OBEYED IN SYDNEY ON THE CONFERENCE ON.

IF YOU THAT EXPECTING TODAY ON BILL A. B. FIVE THIRTY EIGHT OR MY OWN- THEY'RE NOT THAT. OF THE AVERAGE OF CALIFORNIA. THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF AN AEROSPACE COMMISSION OF. BY BILL IS IN OPINION IF CENTRAL TELEPHONE. FIRST IT WILL EMPOWER THE OF THE- TO. THE NEXT PHASE SPACE EXPLORATION. BY TO A LOCAL GOING INDUSTRY. IT WILL HELP BRING A NEW COMPANY TO CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT THIS GROWTH. BUT CAN. IT WILL ENABLE THE NEXT ANALYTICS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION IN CALIFORNIA.

CREATING A NEW DIRECTOR OF THIS COMMISSION YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE HOPING THAT- THAT- THIS SHOULD BE AN ALL VOLUNTEER COMMISSION WHERE THE STAFFING SUPPORT FOR THE COMMISSION WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE UC BERKELEY INSTITUTE FOR TRANSPORTATION STUDIES.

DELIVER CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY BY CREATING GUIDELINES FOR DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES OR HE CONSTRUCTION TO BE UTILIZED BY THE STATE. CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES OR TOOLS OUR CLOUD BASED PLATFORMS USED ON CONSTRUCTION SITES AND SUPPORT DIGITIZE CONSTRUCTION ADMINISTRATION MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION. THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED IN PLACE OF TRADITIONAL PAPER BY OWNERS AND CONTRACTORS FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROJECT SITE PREPARATION FIELD EXECUTION CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MANAGEMENT DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION COLLABORATION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. STATE DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE NOW USING DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE PROJECT COSTS ACCELERATE PROJECT DELIVERY ENHANCE CONSTRUCTION SAFETY AND BUILD MORE INNOVATIVE RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. THROUGH THE DEPLOYMENT OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT COMPANIES MICHIGAN DOT ESTIMATES TWELVE MILLION IN SAVINGS AND ELIMINATION OF SIX MILLION PIECES OF PAPER ANNUALLY AND UTAH DOT IS SAVING NINETEEN POINT FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE CONTRA COSTA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO HAVE ALSO UTILIZE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO SIGNIFICANTLY ELIMINATE PAPER USE AND HELP DEVELOPERS CONTINUE BUILDING DURING COVERT NINETEEN SAFETY RESTRICTIONS. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF GREATER COST SAVINGS TIME AND SUSTAINABILITY BENEFITS THIS SO SHE DID WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT TOOLS UNIFORMLY ACROSS ORGANIZATIONS AND PROJECT DELIVERY STAKEHOLDERS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ONLY IMPLEMENTED THESE TOOLS IN A FRAGMENTED MANNER AB TEN THIRTY SEVEN WILL FIX THIS BY CREATING STATEWIDE GUIDANCE AND POLICIES FOR THE INTEGRATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE USE ON STATE CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.

AB SO I REALLY LIKE THIS PROPOSAL I THINK IT'S ODD IT'S COMPELLING YOU JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK- WE ALSO. SHARE A GOAL OF ENSURING THAT AT SMALL BUSINESSES AND JUST WORK IN BUSINESSES OWNED BY. WOMEN MINORITIES- ENJOY A SHARE OF STATE CONTRACTING DOLLARS- HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT AS WE IMPLEMENT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WHICH I THINK MAKE IT HAD A SNSE. THAT THOSE FOLKS DON'T GET. LEFT BEHIND- ABOUT STOP. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT DID YOU BRING UP OF THOSE- THOSE POLICIES ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS- THIS BILL WOULD INTERFERE WITH THAT HOWEVER. I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND IF ANYTHING IT WOULDN'T HURT TO HELP CODIFY THAT AS WE BRING IN THIS POLICY AS WELL. GREAT YEAH AND I THINK IT DID FOR ME AT THIS SORT OF TRIGGERED YES FOR THE LA PI THINK AS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING. AT FORWARD THINKING POLICIES PROPOSALS WITH AND I THINK PROBABLY TO COUPLE THAT WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE THAT OUR- OUR SMALLEST BUSINESSES ABSOLUTE CONTINUE TO ENJOY THAT AND MOVE FORWARD SEPT THANK YOU AND- AND IF THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED. ALREADY HAS IT YES OKAY. THAT HELPS I'M HAPPY TO. THANK YOU. YOU MISTER CHOP THANK YOU MISTER. IF I COULD- FOLLOW. WITH A COUPLE OF A- QUICK QUESTION TO MAKE TO. FOR THOUGHT ALL THANK YOU FOR THIS. MAYBE THE- IS FOR THE PROFESSOR ALSO- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE JUST OF THIS- THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. FOR TECHNOLOGY'S- IS TO PUT A LOT OF DATA. IN THE CLOUD AND SO THAT YOU KNOW THE DATA COULD BE SHARED AMONGST- VARIOUS- ENTITIES- WHETHER IT'S CONSTRUCTION- INFORMATION OR OR OR OTHER INSIDE INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE. SO IT IS NOT THE IDEA ESSENTIALLY BY PUTTING THE INFORMATION IN THE CLOSET YOU KNOW DATA COULD BE SURE AMOUNTS TO. DIFFERENT THEIR STAKEHOLDERS. ABSOLUTELY AND IT ALLOWS FOR THERE TO BE. A RUNNING TIME INVOLVEMENT. OF AND I WILL REDUCE THIS DOWN REALLY SMALL. TO THE LEVEL THAT I WOULD OPERATE AS HI I'M A GENERAL CONTRACTOR. SO ON SITE- WE CALL IT RED LINING PLANS TEAM SO IF SOMETHING JUST DIDN'T QUITE LINE UP. I WOULD HAVE TO REDLINE IT DIDN'T TAKE IT IN. GET IT APPROVED WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING IN SOME CASES THE PROJECT COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP. UNTIL WE GET THAT APPROVED INSPECTED AND THEN WE COME BACK OUT AND IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE- WORK COULD BE DONE. ON SITE. RIGHT WHEN IT'S HAPPENING. AND AN ENGAGEMENT INTERACTION COULD BE TAKING PLACE. ALL BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE TODAY THAT'S MADE AVAILABLE TO US. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT. SPOTS GEOGRAPHICALLY TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN ONCE ONE AREA OF EXPERTISE SO YEAH JUST A FOLLOW UP ALSO IF THE DATE IS CAN WE SHARE AMONGST. DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. ARE THERE ANY MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT WOULD PROTECT THE DATA FROM BEING LET'S SAY BRIDGE STORE OR LEAKED OR- OR SHARE THE- YOU KNOW WITH THE- OTHER PEOPLE. THAT DON'T KNOW THAT THAT ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A DATA. I APPRECIATE THAT I WOULD- TURN TO THE WITNESS FOR THAT SEVEN BILLION IF WE DON'T HAVE IT- THEN WE CAN GET THAT ANSWER TO MAKE. AND I PRE THAT CAN. BUT BATTLE MONEY CAN I AM TO ALSO. EXISTING OF THE DATA IF YOU MARC THAT I AND WILL HAVE YOU CAN POLICY. I SORRY PROVIDE YOU WERE- THAT YOU STARTED EXPLAIN NINE THAT HE- DATA THE BETTER THAT THIS IS A DO THAT THE GUY PROVISIONS COULD ALL BE INTEGRATED AT DATA SECURITY THEN PUT PART. OF ANY CLOUD BUSINESS. MARKET SO. ALL THE EXISTING TECHNIQUES PLOY THE SITUATION ALSO. THANK YOU PREFER. ADDITIONAL QUESTION MR YOU SAY IT A FELLOW CON RETIRED COURSE HE GOT OUT OF THIS IS GONNA SPEED UP PROJECTS IS GOING TO SAVE THE TAX PAYERS MONIES INTO FOR BIGGER FOR PROJECTS TO WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD.

VICE CHAIR CUNNINGHAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH HI SIR BOERNER HORVATH I STILL LIVE A RECAP I REMEMBER CHECK OUT HI SOME OF OUR FUTURE NORRIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH. SO OVERSTAFFED I. WHAT'S THE BILL CYCLE. I WOULD- I SEE MR COOLEY WELCOME IS COOLEY. MR COOLEY HAS ITEM ELEVEN AND THAT'S E. B. FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN. AND ANYTIME YOU'RE READY MISTER COLLEY HER GOOD ARE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A B. FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN THE RURAL CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE ACT. ARM AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO NOTE I. ACTUALLY I'VE HAD A LONG CAREER WORKING WITH TONY SIMONS WE GO BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY BACK IN THE NINETIES LATE EIGHTIES. ARE SHE HAS CEMEX ON AMENDMENTS I WANNA TAKE THEIR SET UP AND NOT NUMBER FIVE- I WANT TO SAY IS LAWMAKERS. WE PASS STATUTES ALL THE TIME OF GENERAL APPLICATION BECAUSE A THEY WORK ACROSS A BROAD FRONT. THE CONCERN I HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN COUNTY PRINCIPALLY RURAL. THAT HAVE SEEN PERSISTENT NO GROWTH DRIVEN DECLINES IN GROWTH. OF THESE ARE FREQUENTLY RESOURCE RICH COUNTIES THINGS LIKE THAT. I THINK IT IS RIGHT FOR US IN SACRAMENTO AS LAWMAKERS TO JUST TAKE NOTE OF THESE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. THE FAC DIFFERENT CHALLENGES WHEN THEY TRY TO PUT TOGETHER RESOURCES FOR CRITICAL LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT AFFECT PUBLIC SAFETY DISASTER RESPONSE COMMUNITY LIFE. AND THIS BILL IS REALLY DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON THOSE CLASS OF COUNTIES. AND IT IS NOT CLEAR FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT ITS SPECIAL ATTENTION BE GIVEN TO THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THEIR ABILITY TO KIND OF RENEW THEMSELVES ADDRESS CRITICAL LOCAL ISSUES SO THAT THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ENTIRE STATE IS CLEAR EVEN IF THEY'RE A RURAL COUNTY FACING DIFFERENT NEEDS THERE ARE MORE URBAN AREAS. ON TONY IS DONE A GREAT SERVICE BY KIND OF TAKEN THIS IDEA AND FITTED INTO THE HIGH UNDERSTOOD. AND HAS A CLEARER IN ORDER IS THE AVOID REINVENTING THE WHEEL IS KIND OF HOW I VIEW IT FOR VERY VERY HELPFUL AMENDMENTS ON GOING FORWARD I LOOK TO JUST CONTINUE MY CONVERSATION WITH THE REGIONAL COUNCIL RURAL COUNTIES IN C. SACK IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE TRY TO GIVE SOME DIRECTION TO HELP SUPPORT THESE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE REALLY REFINED IS WHO IS PROTECTING WELL ADAPTED THEIR NEEDS LIKE I DO SORT OF HAVE AN ONGOING INTEREST I AM A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL WITH FRANK BIGELOW- AND- SO ESERVER SERVE A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO USE ELECTRIC POWER TO. GIVE SOME GUYS TO THE STATE. ON SO ACTUALLY THAT AGAIN I JUST THANKED THE COMMITTEE. FOR THE AMENDMENTS. FROM AND ARM.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CHECK DEAL HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. M. A LITTLE KNOWN SECRET CALIFORNIA'S TAX SYSTEM AND THAT I'M GONNA LET YOU GUYS IN ON IS THAT EVER SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION EVEN AS THE STATE'S REVENUES HAVE EXPERIENCED RECORD GROWTH. BUT PER CAPITA GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN A SURPRISING NUMBER OFCOUNTIES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN FLAT OR EVEN DECLINED IN REAL DOLLARS OVER THE PAST DECADE OVER THE COURSE OF AN ENTIRE BUSINESS CYCLE IT IS NOT REALLY THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. AT THE COMMUNITIES THAT THIS BILL WOULD BENEFIT IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN NARAL TAX BASIS COMPARED TO A LARGE URBAN AREA BUT THEY BEAR THE BRUNT OF CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL DISASTERS BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY AND ALL THESE NATURAL DISASTERS ARE ARE DEVASTATING TO THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THEY AFFECT ALL OF US. AS WE'VE ALL SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SO IT'S COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES WE THINK TO HELP PREPARE FOR AND RECOVER FROM THESE DISASTERS WE'VE SEEN OUR WATER SYSTEMS DECIMATED WE'VE SEEN ROADS AT THE NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT- AND SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE DO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER NEAL OF SEE NO ONE HERE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT LET'S TURN TO A REMOTE LOCATION I DON'T SEE ANYBODY THERE EITHER.

DO NOT ALIGN SECURE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU- LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMUNITY MISTER SMITH GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WHAT A NOVEL IDEA LIST GET PREPARED BEFORE WE HAVE A CATASTROPHE IN THE STATE. AND BE PREPARED AND HELP THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THE SMALLER OF COMMUNITIES IN THE CALIFORNIA. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING CO AUTHORS OR AUTHORS I'D LOVE TO BE ON IT. THANKS I THINK ALREADY OVED HE BILL FORTY TWO IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MISTER PETRIE-NORRIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANKS TO THE AUTHOR AB TWO RECOGNIZING THAT THE UNIQUE ODD NEEDS OF SEVERAL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES- I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF. FIRST IS WHAT IS MISSING. WITHIN OUR CURRENT. THERE THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRAM RIGHT THAT DOLE OUT INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS HE'S WHAT IN YOUR MIND IS MISSING- RIGHT NOW. THAT NECESSITATES THE CREATION OF AN NEW COMMITTEE AND THEN IS IT YOUR- IS THE BILL PREDICATED ON THE NOTION THAT RURAL COUNTIES ARE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE. RIGHT NOW OF INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS. OR IS IT A DIFFERENT PRESCRIPTION ARM. NUMBER ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MAKE USE OF THE I. BANK SO WE'RE- IT IS CORRECT THAT I PROPOSED A DIFFERENT ENTITY BUT NOW WE'RE ROLLING IT INTO FIFTEEN ADMINISTRATOR FROM HER- WHICH I BELIEVE FURTHERS EFFICIENCY AND HELP SOMEONE TO KNOW GENERALLY HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS. I THINK THE QUESTION BECOMES THE- ECONOMIC STRAITS THE THIRD RURAL COUNTIES ARE IN MAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO BRING THE RESOURCES OF THE TABLE TO COMPLETE PROJECTS. SO I THINK IT IS FAIR TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE TYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF STATIC OR DECLINING POPULATION COUNTIES- RESOURCE BASED ECONOMIES ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT SET UP THE BILL WOULD SORT OF CHARACTERISTIC OF THOSE. AW THAT THEY MAY BE HAVING DIFFICULTY ARE I KNOW- HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH IS NOT ONE OF THESE GUYS PUT HERE SECOND COUNTY IN HERALD. THE CAREER FAIR WHICH IS A FORM COMMITTEE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE- COUNTY- I. HAD FOR MANY YEARS MET IN A HERALD BAR. THE HERALD BARNES STARTED OUT AS A POLE BARN. JUST PUT A PULL CORRECTIVE STRUCTURE. LATE IN ITS LIFE THEY PUT IN A CONCRETE PAD SO THAT HAD A FLOOR. BUT IT'S AGENTS SORT OF FALLING APART. AND IT'S NOT EVEN WELL ADAPTED TO HOW DO YOU UPDATE A POLE BARN- SO I THINK THAT THERE THIS STAND FOR THE IDEA THAT. THERE CAN BE FACILITIES WHICH HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE TO CREATE A LIFE WHICH ARE AGING AND FALLING APART. AND THE ABILITY OF SMALLER COMMUNITIES WITH THE KIND OF POPULATIONS FOR HOW TO. FINANCE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A MAJOR URBAN AREA WHERE YOU CAN PUT TOGETHER A LOT OF RESOURCES. ON CERTIFY I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE. BUT THE UNDERLYING ECONOMICS OF THEIR- COMMUNITIES MAKE IT HARDER TO FINANCE SOME OF THESE THINGS. SO I THINK IT'S JUST A- IT IS WHAT I THINK OF AS A CLASS OF SPECIAL STATUTE TO LOOK AND SAY IS THERE ARE SOME IDENTIFIABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN OUR STATE. BACK THEN WILL BE IN A CALIFORNIANS. THAT WE CAN FASHION A PLAN. OF UNDER THE AYE BANK APPROACH. THEY WILL HAVE TO DOCUMENT WHAT THE NEED IS WHAT THE PROGRAM IS HOW THEY PLAN TO. OUR FULFILL THE NEED IN THE COURTS OF THE STATUTES PURPOSES SO THERE WILL BE A STATE ADMINISTRATOR TO ENSURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE PROPERLY APPLIED. BUT IT IS KIND OF SAYING THAT THERE'S- A VERY RURAL AREA AND OUR STATE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. AT DIFFERENT RESOURCES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. IT'S ALSO VALID FOR THE RISKS INVOLVED I SURVIVE SERVICES TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ON THE STATE SIDE OF STATE TO COMMISSION FOR SEVERITY OF THE ALL THE STATE'S CITIES DOLLARS A MEMBER. AND IN THE PARLANCE OF DISASTER RESPONSE YOU'RE SEEING NOW. MORE DISCUSSION OF WATER ALLUDED TO AS LILY PADS. SMALL SPOTS WITHIN A BROADER EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU KNOW WHEN A DISASTER PEOPLE CAN CONVERGE. I THINK THE LILY PAD MODEL IS ALSO IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ON THE DISASTER RESPONSE PIECE HERE. ON YOU KNOW WHEN INTO PARADISE FIRE A LARGE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ALLIANCE CHURCH IN PARADISE SERVED AS A STAGING AREA. BECAUSE IT WAS A BIG BUILDING WITH A HUGE PARKING LOT. WAS KIND OF SAFE. RIGHT I JUST THINK THEY HAVE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES THIS BILL WILL HELP THEM START TO MEET. AND IF YOU WERE PITCHING A SPELL SAY NOT TO. FIVE URBAN OR SUBURBAN LEGISLATORS BETTER URBAN OR SUBURBAN TAX PAYERS IS THE PITCH TO THEM THAT WE NEED TO INVEST A INCREASE SHARE. IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN RURAL COUNTIES BECAUSE THERE'S SOME COMPELLING STATEWIDE INTEREST FOR DOING SO OR YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE ARE ONE STATE I THINK IT IS A BI PARTISAN MOVE ITS GOVERNING FOR THE WHOLE STATE. FIVE AND INCREASE YOUR ATTENTION IDEA BECAUSE ACTUALLY COMPARED TO WHAT WE SPEND ON THE ENTIRETY OF THE STATE. IT IS DE MINIMUS YOU KNOW IT TO BE NOT EVEN A PERCENTAGE POINT. IT'LL BE SO MINOR. AND YET IT WOULD MEET A TERRIFIC NEED AND DONNA I THINK LONG TERM IT. I RELATED TO MY CITY OF RANCHO CORDOVA WE HAD A VERY ROUGH ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD. ARE IN RANGE OF OVER THE KIDS ACTUALLY REFERRED TO AS A GET OUT. AW AND ONE OF THE STRATEGIC THINGS WE DID WAS WE BOUGHT SOME LAND. BUILT HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE SENIORS ON THE SAME BLOCK AS SOME OF THE OTHER. BAD STUFF AND THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT ACTUALLY RELEASED ENERGY NEARBY. AND SO YOU SORT OF GET THE FLY WHEEL SPINNING WHEN YU PUT SOME PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND INTO AN AREA AND I THINK IN THE SAME WAY AND RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING NEEDED FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS TO SUPPORT OUR POPULATIONS AREAS. IT'S YOU KNOW THERE ARE PART OF OUR STATE. AND IF THIS IS A TOOL WELL ADAPTED TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR NEEDS AND SUPPORT THEIR- COPULATION. THEN IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T MATTER THAT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT TOOL THAT WE TYPICALLY DO. YOU KNOW MOST OF OUR BIG URBAN COUNTIES THEY HAVE LOTS OF STREAMS OF RESOURCES YOU CAN SORT OF PUT TOGETHER AND AGENCIES PEOPLE PARKER. YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET A CITY CAN GET SMART YOU CAN GET OF SAC STATE YOU GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE KIND OF. PUT A SHORT OF THE WHEEL BUT I DON'T THINK THOSE RESOURCES. ARE COMMON IN THESE AREAS AND SORTS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH. I UNDERSTAND THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. C. NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST THINK WILL PROVIDE YOUR BEING HERE AND I REQUEST YOUR RIVALS. I THINK OF IN A TIME WHEN WE SEE SO MUCH DIVISIVENESS. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD TONIC FOR TIME TO STAND UP AND- FUNCTION AS AN ENTIRE STATE. BUT ALSO RESPECTING THE TOOLS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED AND HONED OVER TIME FOR AGAIN TONY THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. ACTUALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT STOP FOR THE BILL IS APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM ELEVEN AB ONE FOUR FOUR SEVEN THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. VICE CHAIR CUNNINGHAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH HER RIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH S. AS SUCH HI ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD HI ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHECK OUT I AM A REPEAT YOU NORRIS. SOME REMEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS HI DELIVER RAMOS. SILVA RAMOS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SPENT. SUMMERS WITH I. YOU HAVE VOTES THE BILL'S UP TO CONGRATULATE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. OUR NEXT SO WE HEALTH. ITEM FOURTEEN THAT'S AB NINE FIFTEEN THAT'S- MISSED ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO. AND BEFORE HE BEGINS I LIKE TO REMIND THE CALLERS TO CALL IN NUMBER IS. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS SHOOT AND- LET'S SEE I UNDERSTAND YOU'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMEDIAN AMENDMENTS IDENTIFIED IN COMMON NINE OF THE BILL ANALYSIS IS ACCURATE YES OF COURSE VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WITH THAT THE PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LET ME JUST START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR AMENDMENTS- THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS HELP INSURE THAT BUSINESSES ARE COMPETITIVE APPLICANTS FOR STATE CONTRACTS. AND CREATE A FAST TRACK FOR WITHIN DGS FOR BUSINESSES CERTIFIED AS BABIES TO RECEIVE. SMALL BUSINESS CERTIFICATIONS. AB NINE FIFTEEN WILL HELP CALIFORNIA LIVE UP TO OUR PROMISE TO SUPPORT SMALL AND DIVERSE BUSINESSES. OUR STATE HAS ENORMOUS PURCHASING POWER AND WE SHOULD USE THAT POWER TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES DURING THIS PANDEMIC CAN BE ON. THE HEART OF THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A 25% DETERMINED GOAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND TAKE STEPS TO MAKE STATE CONTRACTING MORE ACCESSIBLE. TO SMALL DIVERSE BUSINESSES. THIS IS BASED ON AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNED BY FORMER GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. ESTABLISHING A GOAL FOR ALL STATE AGENCIES THAT 25% OF CONTRACTS SHOULD GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES. UNFORTUNATELY THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS IGNORED. OF THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND COMMISSIONS ONLY TWELVE HAVE ADOPTED A SMALL BUSINESS. OR DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS PRICE POLICY. THIS BILL CODIFIES THAT GOAL INTO LAW. AND MANDATES THAT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS BE AUDITED IF THEY DON'T MEET THAT 25% THRESHOLD BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THIS BILL ALSO LOOKS AT SMALL BUSINESS REVIVAL THROUGH EQUITY LINES BY CREATING AND ECONOMIC EQUITY FIRST POLICY. THE CRAZY DEFINITION WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW FOR DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS DVDS. DEFINED AS WOMAN LGBTQ. AND MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. SMALL BUSINESSES DID DISADVANTAGED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND DVDS WITH ALL BE INCLUDED IN THE 25% PROCUREMENT TARGET. LASTLY SINCE APPLYING FOR STATE CONTRACTS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE STATE TO MAKE A LIST OF STATE AGENCY SMALL BUSINESS LIAISONS. ON THANK A COALITION REPRESENTING MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS ETHNIC CHAMBERS AROUND THE STATE AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BRING UP DAVID NELSON. WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AS OUR FIRST WITNESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER NELSON YOU MAY BEGIN. MISS NELSON ARE YOU ON THE LINE. RIGHT HERE BOTH IN PERSON HOW ABOUT THAT RIGHT. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US YOU MAY BEGIN BY THE SUIT ITSELF THAT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT BEING IN HERE SELL- GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU MY NAME IS DAVID NELSON I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR TO WORK WITH MEMBER CHIU AS WELL AS HOLDEN AND HER FELLOW CO SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE CALIFORNIA SPENDING CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN DRAFTING THIS MUCH NEEDED AND LONG OVERDUE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE PRINCIPLES AND DELIVERABLES OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINE ONE FIVE HAVE LONG BEEN OVERDUE. FOR THE SMALL AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ORIGINALLY WE DRAFTED THIS BILL WITH INTENT OF CODIFYING THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. SMALL BUSINESS PICTURE MICHAEL THAT IS MEMBER CHIU ALLUDED TO AS EXISTED. IN EXECUTIVE ORDER FORMAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. BUT IS LONGLEY AS LONG REMAIN VIRTUOUS AS IS NOT BEEN IN STATUTE AND THEREFORE NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY EXISTS FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. TO ACQUIRE THOSE CONTRACTS. SADLY THIS LAST YEAR HAS GREATLY EXASPERATED WHAT WE IN THE MINORITY BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAVE KNOWN FOR FAR TOO LONG. THE MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS OWNERS BEAR THE LION'S SHARE OF DISPARITY AND LACK OF ACCESS. AB NINE ONE FINDS NINE ONE FIVE FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESSES THIS CONCERN BY REQUIRING STATE AGENCIES. TO DEVELOP WHAT WE CALL ECONOMIC EQUITY FIRST ACTION PLANS. THESE ACTION PLANS SHALL FOCUS ON EDUCATING DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND BRING THEM INTO STATE PROCUREMENT PIPELINE. DELIVERING MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR MOST IMPACTED BUSINESS COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALL KNOW. THAT NOT ONLY WILL SMALL BUSINESSES STRUGGLE TO REBOUND FROM THE DEVASTATING ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THIS LAST YEAR. BUT MANY IN OUR DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS COMMUNITIES WILL BE THE LAST TO RECOVER. IF THEY RECOVER AT ALL. AND I JUST WANTED TO SHARE IN CLOSING- AS I WAS WALKING INTO THE STATE CAPITOL TODAY I JUST COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S EASY FOR US TO LOOK OVER STATISTICS AND- REPORTS AND POLL NUMBERS AND SEE. WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN THAT DISPARITY TRULY EXIST IN OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITIES. AND THAT THOSE PEOPLE DO LIVE ON THE MARGINS. BUT I WOULD PROPOSE TO YOU THAT ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM. ARE NOT IN THAT MARGIN. THEY ARE IN THE MARGIN. AND THEY LIVE IN THAT MARGIN EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WON THE CONTRACT. CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DINNER. AND PAYING PAYROLL AND MAYBE DOING BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL FOR THE SAKE OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE MINORITY INTO SAID DISADVANTAGED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR IN PERSON TESTIMONY SO IT'S SO DIFFERENT AND SO REFRESHING TO HAVE FIFA VERY FIRST EFFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT- WITNESS WE HAVE MISSED A LAWRENCE CHAU.

ON BOTH ONE THING THAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS. THAT WE WANT TO GIVEN AN EQUAL CHANCE TO SUCCEED. I THINK SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN HIT PRETTY MUCH THE HARDEST BY COVERT NINETEEN- A LOT OF US HAVE HAD TO CLOSE OUR DOORS TAKE ON DEBT AND EVEN COMPLETELY CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE- REALLY ANXIOUS. FOR THE COMIC RECOVERY- WE'RE REALLY ANXIOUS TO BRING STABILITY TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND WERE REALLY ANXIOUS TO BEGIN SERVING THE PUBLIC AGAIN. THE WAY WHERE ARE USED TO DOING. EIGHTY NINE ONE FIVE HELP SMALL BUSINESSES MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BETTER BUSINESS SAYS- PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTS THAT'S A BIG DEAL TO US. THAT BRINGS EXPOSURE AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO ALLOW THE STATE'S PLEDGE MEETING ABOUT HISTORICALLY SPEAKING I AM A MINORITY BUSINESS OWNER BUT HISTORICALLY SPEAKING MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. GENERALLY HAVEN'T REALLY BENEFITED FROM STATE PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS- WE KNOW THAT THESE CONTRACTS ARE REAL WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THE REALISTIC. FOR ME AND FOR A LOT OF US EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE CHANGES THAT- AB NINE ONE FIVE TELLS US THAT WE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. HELP US THAT THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE REAL.
