ADOPTED THE COMMITTEE ROLES I LIKE TO START OFF WITH A FEW OPENING REMARKS BEFORE WE INVITE THE FIRST PANEL AT I TODAY'S HEARING IS A SECOND IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS SPONSORED BY THE ASSEMBLY JOBS COMMITTEE. AND WHICH WE ARE EXAMINING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR AN INCLUSIVE -- ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE FIRST HEARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE BRIEFED ON KEY ELEMENTS OF THE STATE ECONOMY INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY SECTORS ECONOMIC TRENDS AND STAKEHOLDER INITIATIVES. AND GOALS FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WELL WE HEARD TESTIMONY ON THE STATE'S MANY ECONOMIC SUCCESSES WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE INCREASED INCOME AN OPPORTUNITY GAP WHICH IS RESULTING IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE. AND POPULATION GROUPS FAILING AND FOUGHT FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. THE SECOND HEARING BILLS ON MANY OF THE SAME THEMES AND WE DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT UPWARD MOBILITY AN INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC SECURITY. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE'S OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES. JUST AS INCOME INEQUALITY IS FORTY COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO BEING CHALLENGED TO BECOME MORE RESILIENT AND AN INCREASINGLY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTING FROM CLIMATE CHANGE ANOTHER COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. TO HELP GET THIS ISSUE ODD STARTED TODAY WE HAVE ORGANIZED A HEARING INTO THREE PARTS. FIRST AN OVERVIEW OF INCOME INEQUALITY AND A POTENTIAL FRAMEWORK FOR REDUCING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES AMONG CALIFORNIANS SEC IT WE WILL MOVE FROM POLICY TO PRACTICE. AND HEAR ABOUT HOW OUR COMMUNITY IS USING STATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE NEIGHBORHOOD REVITALIZATION. AND THIRD IT WE WILL HEAR FROM SEVERAL CALIFORNIA'S LARGER COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT RELATED PROGRAMS ON HOW WE ARE USING EXISTING PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WITH THE STATE ALREADY INVESTING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND CLIMATE MITIGATION THE ASSEMBLY JOBS COMMITTEE WILL BE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THESE ISSUES ON INVESTMENT IN HOW WE ARE THE IMPORTANCE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER TRIPLE BOTTLE WALK. BOTTOM LINE OUTCOME FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. SO BEFORE WE BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK -- BY SURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A FEW OPENING COMMENTS. ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT SEE NINE I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST SPEAKER -- WITH US TODAY. TO JOIN US TWENTY MIN DHAKA. AND JUST FOR THE PUBLIC I LIKE BACKGROUND REPORT PREPARED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AMONG OTHER INFORMATION YOU WILL FIND AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE ECONOMY AND INCREASING. CHALLENGE INCOME INEQUALITY IS HAVING ON CALIFORNIA SHORT PROFILES OF THE STATE AGENCIES ARE WHO ARE GOING TO BE PRESENTING TODAY AND SOME SPECIAL APPENDICES ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND RELATED LEGISLATION AND BUDGET ITEMS -- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST SPEAKER -- WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND VICE CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE DEVELOPMENT INTER AGENCY COMMITTEE? SHERMAN DOCTOR COMES TO THIS BE JUDY'S WITH THE UNIQUE PART PRIVATE SECTOR BACKGROUND INCLUDING HAVING SERVED. AS SERVED AT THE SENIOR PARTNER WITH MACKENZIE AND COMPANY AND A LECTURER ON INEQUALITY AT THE STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL -- WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN CERVANTES AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TO JOIN YOU TODAY IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL. IT'S ALSO NICE TO BE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I REMEMBER POSTING THE COMMITTEE IN -- PART OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND SO IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF OVER VIEW ABOUT HOW ONE THINKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE? AND HOW WE MIGHT MOVE FORWARD ON TRYING TO ENSURE AS YOU'RE. HEARING HAS DESCRIBED HELPING ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE -- YOU MAY NOT KNOW FROM MY BIO BUT I WAS BORN IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- I AT GREW UP ON A DAIRY FARM MY FAMILY STILL HAS THAT FORM THERE. AND I HAVE THE PART OF THE REASON THAT I WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TAKING THIS JOB. IS TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE. AND NOT JUST THOSE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN PLACE -- BENEFIT FROM THEIR HEAD TAIL WINDS THAT ARE MOVING THE ECONOMY FORWARD AND THAT'S A LARGE PART OF WHAT I TEACH AT STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL IS THINKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY IN WAYS THAT WORK FOR BUSINESS AND WORK FOR THE ECONOMY. SO I'M EXCITED TO TAK THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND THERE IS. A REAL OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY ACTUALLY HAS SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT WORKS FOR ALL CITIZENS. ENSURING THAT IT IS AN ECONOMY THAT IS BOTH RESILIENT THROUGH THIS ECONOMIC CYCLES. THAT IS ONE WHICH CREATES JOBS. NOT JUST IN THE PART OF THE ECONOMY AND IN THIS PARTY ECONOMIC CYCLE THAT IS AT THE TOP OF THE CYCLE. ONE THAT INSURERS THAT WE ARE DOING THAT IN WAYS WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. AND ONE THAT HELPS CREATE HIGH QUALITY JOBS FOR CITIZENS AND SO I THINK ABOUT MY ROLE AS THE CHIEF ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ADVISER THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AS THE ROLE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS TRYING TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND THINGS ARE NOT WITHIN. THE PURVIEW OF WHAT THAT SPECIFIC THAT'S WHAT I'M WHERE I'M COMING FROM. I DID A WEAPON ARE HOT WITH -- CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT THAT PRESENTED A LOT OF THE DETAIL AND CERTAINLY IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT IT'S ON THE WEBSITE. ON OUR WEBSITE -- LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. FIVE THINGS THAT ARE THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE HINKING ABOUT HOW REGION'S RISE TOGETHER. AB THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP ENSURE THE ECONOMY WORKS BUT IT'S DIFFERENT CONTEXTS AND WHAT PART OF THE STATE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THAT IS NOT THAT WE NEED ONE TOP DOWN STATE APPROACH. BUT THE WE NEED TO HELP INSURE THAT WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE IN THE THE FAR EAST AND THE FAR NORTH OR DRIVEN BY WHAT THOSE REGIONS BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT AND THAT THE STATE'S ROLE WAS TO HELP AND HAVE. ENABLE THEIR SUCCESS SO IT'S ABOUT REGION'S RISING AND RISING BOTH FOR WHAT THEY NEED AND WELL AS CONNECTING THEM SO THAT THERE ARE COMPLEMENTARY CAPABILITIES OF DIFFERENT REGIONS THAT THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER. THE SECOND THING IS THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE HEARTLAND OF THE STATE'S SUCCEEDS. AND BY THAT I MEAN THE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE HAD LESS ATTENTION. FROM POLICY HISTORICALLY FROM THE MEDIA AND LESS FRANKLY FOCUS ON HOW WE SUPPORT WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS IN THE HEARTLAND OF THE STATE. THAT'S NOT AT THE THAT THAT THAT NOT LOOKING UP OF THE COAST BUT REALLY ENSURING THAT THERE IS A FOCUS. ON CENTRA CALIFORNIA THE INLAND EMPIRE AND PARTS WHERE THAT THE EFFORT CAN HELP ENSURE THAT THAT WHAT'S NECESSARY THERE TO SUCCEED WE SUPPORT. THE THIRD THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU SAW SOME OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK. IS THAT CALIFORNIA IS A GLOBALLY CONNECTED ECONOMY. WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT THE EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AT FRONT AND CENTER FOR MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE STATE HAVE REAL ATTENTION. AND AT THE CAPITOL AN INTEREST THAT IS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THIS COUNTRY TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN JOB CREATING OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR STATE. IS MADE AVAILABLE AND SO YOU SAW LAST WEEK PROBABLY AT THE GOVERNOR STOOD UP THE COMMISSION THE INTERAGENCY COMMISSION THAT YOU MENTION AS WELL AS APPOINTED. HAD NAME THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AS THE IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE THE STATE TO HELP FACE -- THE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPRESENT THE STATE AROUND THE WORLD -- IN MY ROLE AS IN THE SURE THAT WE HAVE [inaudible] REAL FOR APPROACH TO HAVE CALIFORNIA FACE THE EXTERNAL WORLD I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU WILL HEAR FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THAT CONCERNS ABOUT. CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO EXPORT IS HURTING OUR JOB CREATION SO TRYING TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE'VE GOT A FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL. THE FOURTH THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT -- THERE IS AN IMPORTANT IT I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS LATER TODAY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE NEED. SO WE HAVE AN AN AMAZINGLY VIBRANT ECONOMY OVERALL. AND WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY TRYING TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT ECONOMY. AND ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE ALL OF THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO HAVE THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED AND THE ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FROM A FROM THE ECONOMY STANDPOINTS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN I'M TALKING TO BUSINESS LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY SAY TO ME. AND IT'S IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COULD USE SOME HELP IN ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE. THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY NEED. AND FINALLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP DEPLOY CAPITAL IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND FOR THINGS THAT ARE HIGH PRIORITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MASH MENTIONED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT UP TOOL IN A SET OF TOOL KITS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DELIVERING. THE CAPITAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE IF THAT IS COMBINED WITH A WHOLE SET OF OTHER TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING. ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT THE THE STATE HAS EXISTING PROGRAMS TO HELP ALIGN THOSE AROUND ENSURING THAT THAT CAP WAS DEPLOYED FOR JOB CREATION. AND JOB CREATION THAT HELPS WITH OTHER GOALS LIKE CARBON REDUCTION AND HIGH QUALITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL. OF ALL OF THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT I THINK OF AS TO WHAT IS BOTH SMART POLICY. AND SMART INVESTMENT. CAPITAL PROVIDERS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE THAT ARE IN BUSINESS FOR THE LONG TERM THINK ABOUT THEIR ROLE AND SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE ROLE IS HELPING MAKE THE ECONOMY WORK NOT JUST THEIR NARAL SHORT TERM PROFIT INTERESTS. AND WHERE IT WHEN WE'RE AT OUR BEST THAT'S WHAT POLICY HELPS ENABLE HELPS ENABLE HIGH QUALITY BUSINESSES WHO ARE JOB CREATORS. GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR HELP IN ADVANCE THE SET OF POLICY OBJECTIVESDO THE RIGHT THING THEY LIKE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND OUR JOB IS TO HELP SUPPORT THEM AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE POSSIBILITY AS THIS IS ALL IN THE CONTEXT. OF HOW DO WE HELP ENSURE THE COUNTY CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE AND THAT WE CAN RENEW THE CALIFORNIA DREAM THAT MANY OF US INCLUDING ME CAME TO THE STATE IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD. I WAS BORN HERE BUT MY PARENTS WERE MIGRANTS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL -- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR TAKE PERSPECTIVES ON WHAT THE WHAT YOU. WOULD LIKE TO AND APPRECIATE THE TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS MOMENT. MR ALMOST JUST -- ONE CHAIR WHEN YOU SAY REGIS AND AND RISING TOGETHER BUT THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS IN EACH ONE OF THOSE REGIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE IDENTIFIED. AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THOSE AREAS SO CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SOME OF THOSE ARE. SURE SO -- THE BUT IF WE WERE SET UP IS SEPARATE STATES WITHIN AN ECONOMY WE HAVE THE RICHEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND SILICON VALLEY AND WE HAVE THE POOREST STATE IN THE COUNTRY IN THE CENTER PART OF THE STATE FROM CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND THAT'S EVEN FOR THE COST OF DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE A WIDE DISPERSION OF INCOME AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS THE CENTER PART OF THE STATE. SO CENTRAL CALIFORNIA THE INLAND EMPIRE AS A FIRST PRIORITY THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE THE GROWTH IS IT'S A LOT OF WEAR THAT THE POPULATION GROWTH IS IT'S A LOT OF WHERE THE THE ECONOMIC NEEDS ARE IT'S A LOT OF WHERE. THE FUTURE OF THE WORK FORCE IS COMING FROM AND FRANKLY IT'S A PLACE WHERE WE NOT PAID AS MUCH ATTENTION AS A STATE AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO ENSURE THAT WHAT INLAND EMPIRE NEEDS. WE HELP. AND WHAT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA NEEDS WE HELP IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE THE ANSWERS IT'S HELP AND WORK WITH THEM. TO HELP UNDERSTAND THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND THEN WORK WITH THEM TO HELP ENABLE THAT [inaudible] THE CHAPEL. YOU MENTION ABOUT EXPERT -- AND I'M JUST WONDERING OF WHAT DE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN UP WITH THE MOST RECENT TRADE WAR ARE AND HOW IT HAS IMPACTED -- VERY SECTORS ARE WHO ARE CONDUCTING BUSINESSES HERE IN THE STATES OR IN AND A IN EXPORTING FOR EXAMPLE AND HOW BOB DAVIE COULD COPE WITH THE SITUATION. NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER TRY THAT THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION -- THE OF THE US IS TRYING TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THAT IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS IN THE STATE IS AS WELL -- SO WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE VIEW OF IT IN A YOU KNOW. COMPREHENSIVE WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE INDICATIONS ARE AND CERTAINLY THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE WHEN I'M OUT ACROSS THE STATE AND I'M SURE YOU'RE HEARING IT AS WELL IS EXTREMELY NEGATIVE. IT IS A TERRACE HAVE HELPED CREATE A BARRIER TO HIGH QUALITY BUSINESSES WHO WANT TO EXPORT. BECAUSE IT'S PREVENTED THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER MARKETS AND IT'S ALSO RAISE THEIR COSTS. FOR IMPORTS THAT THEY HAVE COMING IN TO TRY AND HELP THEIR BUSINESS SUCCEED -- ALMOST EVERY ECHO ARE A BAD ECONOMIC TOOL. AND SO TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON EXACTLY THE IMPACT OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE TAKING A LOOK AT MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS THAT IT IS. UP THE EVEN MORE NEGATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA THAN IT IS FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ARE MUCH MORE EXPLORATORIUM ALMOST BY DEFINITION IT'S GOING TO BE WORSE. AND SECONDLY IT IS WHEN WE GET INTO WORD AFFECTS PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AND PARTICULAR DROP GEOGRAPHIES IT'S UNFORTUNATELY MOST LIKELY TO HURT THOSE THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD FOR IT TO BE HEARD. SO SMALL MANUFACTURERS WHO RELY ON INTERNATIONAL EXPECTS PORTS AND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS TO COME IN AGRICULTURE WHO ARE FUNDAMENTALLY EPENDENT ON THE STATE ON EXPORTS. THOSE WHO ARE IMPORTING PRODUCTS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD TO ADD VALUE TO THEM IN CALIFORNIA OR HURT WHEN THOSE INPUT COSTS COME UP BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PASS THAT ON TO TWO OTHERS VERY EASILY. AND THEN THOSE WERE BUYING THOSE ARE HURT TOO SO IT IS A HORRIBLE ECONOMIC POLICY AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA. CAN STE ARTICULATE WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE GLOBAL RELATIONSHIP IS KIND OF WHERE WE'RE I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE HAD. TO ADD ON TO THAT WERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES WERE CALIFORNIA CAN ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVE NEST WITHIN THIS LARGER MARKET THANK YOU AB. SO WE ARE VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THAT FULL AND COMPLETE STRATEGY -- THE ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS WHERE ARE THE EXISTING LARGE TRADING PARTNERS OF THE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THOSE WOULD BE -- PLACES THE OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION CERTAINLY TO THE SOUTH MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE NORTH CANADA. CHINA SOUTHEAST ASIA MORE BROADLY WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA SO IT'S IT'S THE ECONOMY IS WHERE WE HAVE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS AND POTENTIAL FOR LARGER INTERACTION. IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE THE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FLOWS THE GO BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SO IT'S NOT JUST GOODS THAT MOVE ON SHIPS ACROSS OR ON TRAINS OR ON TRUCKS ACROSS BORDERS. IT'S ALSO THE THE FLOWS OF INFORMATION AND PEOPLE AND IDEAS THAT WE NEED TO THINK HARD ABOUT. AND THEN FINALLY I DO THINK THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THE SWITCHES JUST FACING UP TO THE REALITY OF OUR CONNECTION WITH MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE FROM OUR FIRST GENERATION WERE SECOND GENERATION RESIDENTS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS TO THEM. AND SO HOW DO WE HELP INSURE THAT THAT CONNECTION IS ENABLED NOT DISRUPTED BY BY -- INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT THIS IS FEDERAL POLICY ANDERSON AND THAT'S NOT OUR ROLE. BUT OUR ABILITY TO ARTICULATE THAT HAVING A GLOBALLY RELEVANT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH CAN BE GOOD FOR OUR CITIZENS AND OUR BUSINESSES IS SOMETHING THAT WE WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO WAS AN AMBASSADOR AND IS REALLY REALLY CAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING THAT TO HELP US PLAY THAT ROLE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU -- I WAS CURIOUS AS TO YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN CALLED THE THE SKILLS GAP MEANING THAT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION -- RETIRED PEOPLE RETIRING OUT OF THE SKILLED TRADES IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS -- SOME OF US IN THIS BUILDING AND WORKED VERY HARD TO SUPPORT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF OF THE SKILLED WORKFORCE. AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT -- TERM THREAT THE SKILLS GAP POSES TO OUR CONTINUED PROSPERITY. THANK YOU OF SOME CUNNINGHAM IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'M I THINK OF IT AS BOTH THE SKILLS GAP AND AN OPPORTUNITY GAP. SO WE HAVE. AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF JOB OPENINGS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE AND WE HAVE A A RETIREMENT OF A A LARGE PORTION OF THE THE POPULATION HAS BEEN FILLING SOME OF THOSE NEEDS. THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN ADDITION TO A GAP AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HELP INSURE THAT BOTH THROUGH OUR K. TO TWELVE SYSTEM ARE HIGHER POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR WORK FOR SYSTEM. THAT WE ARE ENSURING THAT THE SETS OF FOLKS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE KINDS OF ROLES HAVE THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED TO BOTH ENTER THOSE JOBS BUT ALSO ADVANCE. SO ON THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED REALLY IMPORTANT PRIORITY AROUND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF APPRENTICESHIPS IN THE STATE. PART OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE WORLD THE WORK CHANGES IS THAT IT'S YOU WON'T BE. DOING ALL OF YOUR LEARNING BY THE TIME YOU'RE TWENTY AND AND EARNING FOR THE REST YOUR LIFE IT'S GOING TO BE A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF LEARNING AND LEARNING THROUGHOUT. I DON'T THINK THAT IS FRIGHTENING THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE AND SO OUR ROLE IS TO HELP THEM. INSURED THAT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE CAN HELP. WE WANT TO HELP INSURE THAT THEY'VE GOT THOSE SKILLS SO -- I'VE IDEA I THINK IT IS BATES EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR DEMOGRAPHY BECAUSE OF THE THE NATURE OF WHAT OUR WORK FORCES IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK THAT WILL BE HAPPENING GOING FORWARD. SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE SKILLS TO ENTER THE SETS OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE BUT AS WORK CHANGES OVER TIME BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF GLOBALIZATION JUST BECAUSE OF HOW. OCCUPATIONS AND INDUSTRIES CHANGE THAT WE HELP THEM ENSURE THEY HAVE THE LIFETIME SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE AND HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE UP THE CAREER LADDER THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER REVERSED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION YOU KNOW I LIKE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS LIKE OR AS YOU SAY DO YOU KNOW REGION'S RISING TOGETHER -- AND RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO LIGHT UP IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE WE COULD ALSO HAVE A REGIONAL APPROACH FOR THAT RIGHT WHERE -- THE BUSINESSES AND REGION ARE WORKING WITH THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SECTOR TO MAKE SURE. THAT WERE LINING RIGHT THOSE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR KIDS DO YOU HAVE ANY AYE. GET THERE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER REST THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF WHAT'S COULD BE AS NECESSARY FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL GIVEN WHAT THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THE REGION ARE. IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE IS AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT'S OVER HERE I WORK FOR SYSTEM THAT'S OVER HERE AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE OVER HERE. THEY NEED TO BE AND COORDINATED IN A WAY THAT HELPS ENSURE. THAT THE AT THE NEEDS THAT BUSINESS AND EMPLOYERS HAVE ARE ALIGNED WITH WHAT THE SKILL DEVELOPMENT THAT HAPPENS IN THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM IN THE K. TO TWELVE AND POST SECONDARY SYSTEM DOES THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE -- BUT I THINK THERE ARE REALLY SOME INTERESTING EXAMPLES ACROSS THE STATE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THAT REALLY WELL -- THERE ARE EXAMPLES IN AND IN AND OUT PLACES THAT PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO IN TERMS OF THEIR SUCCESS. SO THERE ARE A WHO ARE DOING REALLY INTERESTING THINGS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. OF HELP ENSURING THAT THERE ARE ALIGNED THEIR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WITH WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE. THERE INTERESTING PARTNERSHIPS IN PLACES THAT ARE CREATING PROMISE PROGRAMS FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD ALL THE WAY THROUGH THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL THROUGH POST SECONDARY. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE WARRANT HAVING EVERYONE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. IN THAT IN THE WORK FORCE GOING FORWARD AND I THINK WHAT PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS UNDERSTAND IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE WHAT IS WORKING THERE. WHAT CAN WE ACCELERATE WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE OR HONESTLY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY? THAT WE CAN HELP AND TRANSFER THOSE BEST PRACTICES SO GO IN AND LOOK LOOK AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING IT'S REALLY ABOUT ACCELERATING THOSE GREAT SUCCESSES AND THERE ARE ALL OVER THE STATE. HOW DO YOU WOULD YOU SEE THE STATE'S TRANSITION INTO A LOWER CARBON ECONOMY IMPACTING BUSINESSES AND OUR WORK FORCE NEEDS? SURE. ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION AROUND HOW WE THINK ABOUT AND SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. THE INTERSECTION OF THOSE GOALS THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT CALLED THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE AND YOU MENTIONED THAT IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY. HAVE PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY FOR WHAT THAT IS BUT THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS IT'S SMART INVESTING AND SMART BUSINESS IF YOU REALLY ARE THERE FOR THE LONGER TERM WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING IS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DESTROYING THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND. YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING IS HELPING ENSURE THAT YOUR ACTIONS LEAD TO A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY AND A HIGH QUALITY. ENVIRONMENT AROUND YOU AND SO. THE WHAT I THINK MOST BUSINESSES LOOK FOR IN THAT REGARD IS CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY OF WHAT THE THE POLICIES ARE. THEY CAN OPERATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY KNOW WHAT THE THE RULES ARE AND WHAT THE THE NATURE OF THE THE OPPORTUNITY IS IN MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. CARBON IS PRICED INTO HOW WE HOW THE BUSINESS IS DONE. IN MANY BUSINESSES IN THIS STATE. AND MANY BUSINESSES IN THIS COUNTRY THEY'RE USING THAT FOR THEIR DECISION MAKING ALREADY. AND SO TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE ENSURE THAT. THAT ARE. CLIMATE OBJECTIVES ARE LINED WITH OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS REALLY JUST SMART BUSINESS. THANK YOU UNDER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME I DO WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AS RELATES TO PRIVATE CAPITAL DOES THE STATE HAVE A GAME PLAN TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL -- WHEN IT COMES TO MEETING OUR STATES INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS? SO AB. THERE ARE. IT'S BOTH THE STATE QUESTION AND A PRIVATE CAPITAL QUESTION PRIVATE CAPITAL HAS ITS VIEWS ABOUT WHERE IT WANTS TO GO. AND SO WE CAN'T DO THAT IN THERE ARE THEIR INTERESTS ARE WHAT WOULD YOU DO IS ALIGN OUR POLICY. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR INVESTMENTS ARE ALIGNED WITH WHAT OUR INTERESTS ARE SO THAT WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE QUESTION. YOU ASKED ME A MINUTE TO GO AROUND. AND CARBON OBJECTIVES SO WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE DOING IS TRACKING INVESTMENT THAT IS TRYING TO MEET THE STATE'S CARBON GOALS. TRYING TO MEET OUR HOUSING GOALS AND TRYING TO MEET OUR HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED. TO ENSURE ARE ALIGNED -- THE THERE ARE ELEMENTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE DOING THAT AND OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP MAKE SURE THOSE TOOLS ARE WORKING TOGETHER. TO HELP INCREASE THE ATTRACTIVENESS FROM AN INVESTMENT STANDPOINT FROM COUPLE WANTS TO COME HERE AND ENSURE THAT IT'S DEPLOYED TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE THOSE STATE POLICY OBJECTIVES. THANKS FOR WHAT SEE THAT WE HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND SHARING YOUR NEW POSITION WITHIN -- THE NEW SEVEN MINISTRATION AND YOUR VIEWS ON HOW WE CAN CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND I'M SURE THAT -- WILL HAVE PLENTY TO DISCUSS OVER THIS NEXT SESSION THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. FOR NEXT SPEAKER DOCTOR HIS SHOES HERNANDEZ -- COULD COME. TO THE TABLE I WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF FRAME WORK ON THIS AGENDA ITEM. WITH AN ECONOMY LARGER THAN ALL THE FOUR NATIONS IN THE WORLD IN AND YOU'LL SEE BUDGET EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN A CULTURAL. A CULTURE OF DIVERSITY AND INNOVATION. CALIFORNIA COULD BE READY TO EMBRACE AN INCLUSIVE THE DEVELOPMENT MODEL A MODEL THAT BUILDS RESILIENCE RESILIENCY AND SUPPORT TO REGIONAL AND NEIGHBORHOOD PRIORITIES WHAT CREATING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS ALIKE. IMPLEMENTING THIS MODEL WILL TAKE SOME NEW WAYS WE HAVE ASKED OUR NEXT SPEAKER SPEAKER DOCTOR HIS SHOES HERNANDEZ PRINCIPLE OF J. C. H. RESEARCH TO HELP US LOOK MORE DEEPLY AT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO SUPPORT. AN INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT MODEL BASED ON SUSTAINABLE PRINCIPLES DOCTOR HERNANDEZ HAS SPENT HIS CAREER DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY BASED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES HE'LL BE USING HIS WORK WITH THE FRANKLY NEIGHBORHOOD IN SACRAMENTO AS A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE. OF HOW LEGISLATION TRANSLATES TO PRACTICE OUR DOCTORS MANTIS IF YOU LIKE TO BE ON GOOD MORNING THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME TODAY. MY SHORT PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS. ON HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY AT THE NEIGHBORHOODS SCALE. AND HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND CLOSER. TOWARDS THE GOVERNOR'S QUEST FOR MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. WE NOW HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATES THAT FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. AND A KEY PART OF THIS LEGISLATION AIMS TO ADDRESS ANY QUALITY IN OUR CITIES. SO POLICY NOW PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON REPAIRING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN A NEW GREEN ECONOMY [inaudible] HOWEVER. REGION'S IN MUNICIPALITIES ARE NOT SURE HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS. REGIONAL PLANNING IS NOT REALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO THE IMPORTANT QUESTION HERE IS HOW DO MUNICIPALITIES MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AGENDA. AT ITS ROOT. CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION IS BASED UPON THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES. THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY IS VERY SIMPLE. ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN A BALANCE OF ECONOMIC STEWARDSHIP. ECONOMIC GROWTH. ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EQUITY. ALL OF OUR PUBLIC INVESTMENTS MUST WORK TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE WITHOUT COMPROMISING. THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR FUTURE NEEDS. WE MUST ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. IN THIS MANNER WE RESTORE AND REVITALIZE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHAT BRINGING CAPACITY FOR RESILIENCE. SO IN THIS MODEL. THERE'S FIVE BASIC ELEMENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING NEIGHBORHOOD SUSTAINABILITY. EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT HOUSING HEALTH CARE AND WILL THE COMMUNITY IN OPPORTUNITIES. WE MUST ALSO LOOK AT THE SOFT AND HARD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CONNECTIVE TISSUE. TRANSPORTATION ENERGY. BUILDINGS ROADS BROADBAND EXCEPT. FOR THESE TIED TOGETHER THOSE FIVE IMPORTANT SOCIAL GOODS. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL INTERDEPENDENT IF ONE GOES BAD THEY ALL GO BACK. SO WHEN WE READ VALUE WAIT NEIGHBORHOOD SYSTEMS WE SHOULD ASK SOME VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS. ARE THESE NEIGHBORHOODS SYSTEMS RELIABLE. CAN I DEPEND ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE RESTORED. HOW DO WE FIX THAT? AND ARE THEY RESILIENT. HOW DO WE RECOVER [inaudible] AND WITH TITLE SIX OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. ARE THESE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS BEING USED TO REPAIR AND REGENERATE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS LEFT BEHIND. THIS IS THE ANALYTICAL LANDS THAT ENSURES THAT WE INCLUDE ALL NEIGHBORHOODS IN CLIMATE CHANGE. WHEN WE USE THIS APPROACH PUBLIC INVESTMENT STRATEGIES FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECOME RESTORATIVE REGENERATIVE BY DESIGN? ECONOMIC INVESTMENT PRESERVES OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. WHILE PROVIDING SOCIAL PROTECTIONS IN MARKET ACCESS TO ALL NEIGHBORHOODS. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS MEANS WE USED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS AN IMPORTANT UNIT OF ANALYSIS. IT'S A LAYER OF GOVERNANCE THAT'S MISSING FROM THE SUSTAINABILITY EQUATION. AS WELL AS THE DEBATE. NOW TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS LEGISLATIVE CLIMATE CHANGE TOOL KIT. I USE A CASE STUDY OF THE FRANKLIN NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO. OUR GOALS ARE VERY SIMPLE. G. H. T. REDUCTION [inaudible] NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION. OUR TARGETS FOSSIL FUEL TRANSIT. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND MOST IMPORTANT HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT. I STRATEGIES MULTI MODAL TRANSIT TREATING PUBLIC SPACE. RENEWABLE ENERGY AND CRADLE TO CAREER NETWORKS. NOW WE HAVE THE FOUNDATION. FOR MOVING INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THIS IS HOW IT WORKS. WE RECENTLY ONE OF GRANT FOR A COMPLETE STREETS REDESIGNED WHICH IS OUR FOUNDATION FOR A DEFICIENT MULTI MODAL TRANSIT NETWORK. WILL ADDRESS HEAT MITIGATION CREATE PUBLIC SPACE WITH A GREEN CANOPY PROMOTE SAFETY AND HEALTH INCREASE RESIDENT BUSINESS CONNECTIVITY AND HAVE A POSITIVE ECONOMIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT. PEOPLE PLACE AND PLANTED. THIS ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HOUSING AND TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS HOUSING. IS LEVERAGED AND COMPLIMENTS THE NEW GREEN STREET SCAPE. THE NEIGHBORHOOD RECENTLY WON A TRANSFORMATION -- TRANSFORMING CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANT FOR THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. AND IT JUST ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE THE NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING AT THE NEIGHBORHOODS SCALE. THIS WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE THE MULTIPLE WAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION CAN BE USED TO REVITALIZE A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. WE COMPLEMENT IS GREEN STREET SCAPE WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD SHUTTLE THAT PROVIDES INTERNAL CONNECTIVITY TO THE BUSINESS COR EXTERNAL CONNECTIVITY TO REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND WE REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BY CONNECTING TO LIGHT RAIL. AND BUS LINES ONE REVITALIZING THE BUSINESS CORE. AND WE CONNECT THE DOTS WITH SOLAR PARKING LOT CANOPIES. AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESOURCE CENTER WE RECENTLY GRANT OF SOLAR ARRAYS EASING TENSION WIRES RATHER THAN IN THE GROUND TYPE OF FOUNDATIONS. THIS ALLOWS US FOR LOCAL FOR A TWO THIS ALLOWS US LOCAL RENEWABLE ENERGY. GENERATION WAS STORAGE ALLOWS FOR MICHAEL GOOD TO PASS CITY FOR DISASTER RECOVERY PLANS A HEAT COOLING CENTER OF JOB TRAINING IN THE INDUSTRY ENERGY INDUSTRY AND HAS PUBLIC HEALTH. PROVIDES CHARGING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND REDUCES THE COST OF ENERGY TO THE TENANTS AND AT THAT THE PROPERTY. AND THIS SITE ALSO BECOMES AN IMPORTANT RESEARCH LOCATION. FORTY POINT DISTRIBUTIVE ON DEMAND ENERGY CONCEPTS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND WE ALSO WANT TO FIVE MILLION GRAY -- DOLLAR GRANT. FOR WEATHERIZATION AND ROOF TOP SELLERS. WE SCALE THIS UP. BY RE PURPOSING BLIGHTED LAND FOR LARGE SCALE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECTS THAT BECOME NEIGHBORHOOD INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR SOLAR PROJECT BECOMES A SITE FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ADDITION TO AN ELEVEN ACRE SOLAR ARRAY WE ALSO PROVIDE PUBLIC SPACE WITH A ONE ACRE COVERED SORT OF CANOPY AS WELL AS FOOTBALL AND SOCCER FIELDS FOR THE YOUTH LEAGUES. WE ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS BY PRODUCING RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR SALE TO THE LOCAL UTILITY COMPANY. AND THIS CREATES A NEIGHBORHOOD GENERATED UNRESTRICTED REVENUE SOURCE. WHICH IS THEN REINVESTED IN NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CARE AND THIS IS A REPUTABLE BUSINESS MODEL THAT CAN BE PLAYED IN ANY TACK. AND WE CONTINUE TO CONNECT THE DOTS WITH A DECENTRALIZED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FUNDED BY SOLAR ENERGY REVENUES THAT MATCHES MATCHES UNIVERSITY PRECEPTOR TRAINING PROGRAMS OF VIRTUAL HEALTH CARE. VIRTUAL HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND ALLIED HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT CREATE AXIS FOR NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS TO HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AS WELL AS HEALTH INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT. AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO LEVERAGE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT TO CREATE A NEIGHBORHOOD FOCUSED INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT LEADS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION. NEIGHBORHOOD CLEAN ENERGY OPTIONS HEALTH CARE ACCES JOBS AND TRAINING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AT REHABILITATE AND INCREASE OUR HOUSING STOCK. SO THERE'S A LOGIC TO ALL OF THIS. THROUGH DIRECT NEIGHBORHOOD INVESTMENT WE SEE JOBS ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP BUILDING AND WE BUILD CAPACITY FOR PROJECTS. WE SEE TO RECTIFY X. TO BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS IN SAVINGS INDIRECT EFFECTS INCLUDE INCREASED NEIGHBORHOOD SPENDING. BUSINESS AND JOB RETENTION AND WE MEET OUR TARGET OF NEIGHBORHOOD SUSTAINABILITY STABILIZE IN OUR BUSINESSES AVOIDING DISPLACEMENT AND THE LOSS OF EXISTING JOBS. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY NOW BECOMES AN ACTIVE PARTICIPATION PARTICIPANT AND CLIMATE CHANGE. SO IF WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. WE NEED ENERGY POLICY THAT ENCOURAGES. TAX OR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN ENERGY MARKETS AS PRODUCERS NOT AS DEPENDENT. DEPENDENCE ON UTILITY SUBSIDIES. WE NEED TRANSIT POLICY THAT BRINGS TRANSIT TO HOUSING. RATHER THAN HOUSING TO TRANSIT. WE NEED HOUSING POLICIES THAT FINANCIALLY SUPPORT NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIFIC NEEDS. WE NEED TO STRIP IT OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY THAT BRINGS ACCESS TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. IF WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS THIS INCLUSIVE ECONOMY WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT REGIONAL PLANTS ARE NOT REALLY DESIGNED TO SOLVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICTS. INVESTMENT READY PROJECTS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT OVERLAP WITH OPPORTUNITIES ONS REQUIRED INTENSIVE AMOUNT OF PLANNING. NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIFIC PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS BUT THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO FUNDING FOR SUCH TYPE. THE TRANSFORMING KEL CLIMATE COMMUNITIES IS A GOOD START. BUT REQUIRES MUCH MORE FUNDING TO BRING THIS CONCEPT TO SCALE. AND LOCAL AGENCIES NEED TO NEED RESOURCES TO CREATE THE DECENTRALIZED PLANNING MECHANISMS NEEDED FOR NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING. WE JUST SIMPLY CANNOT DO THIS ONE NEIGHBORHOOD AT A TIME. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO THIS RIGHT. WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES A PRIORITY BEFORE EXTERNAL PROFIT. WE SEE JOBS AND ENERGY HEALTH TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING WE AVOID DISPLACEMENT WE AVOID GENTRIFICATION AS PEOPLE WILL STAND OR NEIGHBORHOODS. WE SEE EDUCATIONAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL PATHWAYS AND MOST IMPORTANT WE BEGIN TO MEET OUR TITLE SIX OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THIS IS HOW WE CAN CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. AND REVITALIZING OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR HERNANDEZ. I WILL START OFF. WITH A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE OPENING UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS HOW DO YOU RECOMMEND MODIFYING -- CITY PLANNING MODELS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. A VERY GOOD START WAS SB ONE THOUSAND THAT REQUIRES MUNICIPALITIES TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BECAUSE JUSTICE COMPONENTS INTO THEIR GENERAL PLAN. THIS IS REALLY AT THE HEART OF THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN MUNICIPALITIES. AND NEIGHBORHOODS. MISS ABOUT THESE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SCALE DOWN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY PLANNED FOR BIG TICKET ITEMS LIKE ARENAS AND DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT. AND THEY DO VERY GOOD AT IT. BUT THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENS. IN THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND HOW TO MAKE THE LEGISLATION OPERATIONAL. SO THEY NEED MORE RESOURCES TO DO THIS TYPE OF PLANNING. AND THAT SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THESE GENERAL PLANS AT THE MUNICIPALITY LEVEL. THANK YOU AND WHAT AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS THE STATE CAN TAKE. I TO SUPPORT OF MORE MOVE UPWARD MOBILITY WITHIN AT THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS. AT THE STATE LEVEL. THERE NEEDS TO BE A A MECHANISM WHERE WE ACTUALLY. PUT A PRIORITY ON NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE PLANNING. WE HAVE LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE. STATE REGION MUNICIPALITY AS AN HOUSEHOLD WE MISS THIS NEIGHBORHOOD CONCEPT. THAT MEANS THE PENALTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUT HAVE NO RESOURCES [inaudible] TO ADDRESS. SO -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE TRANSFORM IF TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT DOES STRATEGIC LOWER GROWTH COUNCIL IS CURRENTLY IN CHARGE OF I NEED A LOT MORE MONEY TO SCALE THESE PROJECTS UP. PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY AGAIN ALL THIS WORK THAT YOU SEE DOWN HERE THIS THIS IS THREE YEARS OF WORK. FOR FREE. NEIGHBORHOODS CAN AFFORD THIS KIND OF WORK. AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THESE MODELS BECOME COME TO THE SURFACE BECAUSE THE REALITY IS IS THAT IF WE CAN'T PERCOLATE PROJECTS FROM BELOW. WE CAN'T WRITE THE GRASS FUND. NOBODY FUNDS THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE THE AND PLANNING IS THE KEY. TO THAT HAPPENING THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER REQUEST. THANK YOU DOCTOR HERNANDEZ SOME. YOU KNOW ONE COMMUNITY IN MY DISTRICT JUST RECEIVE THE TRANSFORMING CLIMATE COMMUNITIES GRANT -- PACOIMA WHICH IS WHERE I GREW UP -- AND A LOT OF WHAT YOU PRESENTED -- IT SEEMS LIKE WITH THE PLAN FOR THAT PROJECT IS SIMILAR -- SO I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE -- YOUR PRESENTATION -- AND BUT DO YOU THINK WITH PROP YOU KNOW MUNICIPALITIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PLAN. BUT I'M I'M HOPING THAT THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED CAN SERVE AS EXAMPLES AS AS A PLACE THAT YOU CAN GO AND SEE IT ONCE THESE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED -- AND THEN HIGHLIGHT THE NEED OF NEIGHBORHOOD SKILLS. YES -- AND ONE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU. HOW MANY NEIGHBORHOODS IN YOUR AREA WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT TYPE OF GRANT? ALL OF THEM AND SO WILL WE CAN ONLY DO IT ONE NEIGHBORHOOD AT A TIME IN MORE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SCALE THIS URGENCY UP. WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO REALLY ROLL OUT WHAT WE CALL CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DOCTRINE AND IS FOR BEING HERE ARE YOU MISSION -- THAT WE SHOULD BRING TRANSIT TO HOUSING AND ALL AND THAT'S A VERY FASCINATING CONCEPT I AM JUST WONDERING UP. OCCASIONALLY WE SAY WE ARMED BUILT AROUND TRANSIT FOR EXAMPLE IS WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE LIKE SO ARE WE HAVE BE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT BACKWARDS-- OR IS THAT NOT THE CASE SO. WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK AT WHERE TRANSIT IS LOCATED? N. HISTORICALLY TRANSIT IS NOT LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHICH ELIMINATES THEM FROM ANY KIND OF TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT FUND. WHICH MEANS WE SKEW WHERE THIS MONEY GO THIS AND IT DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LEGISLATION WHICH IS SAYS. GET TO THE DACS GET TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND IMPLEMENT THESE CLIMATE CHANGE TOLLS. BUT WHEN IT OPERATES ON THE GROUND. WE HAVE THESE RULES THAT SAY YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS WHERE TRANSIT IS LOCATED. WHICH WIPES OUT MY NEIGHBORHOOD FROM THE PROCESS SO HOW DO WE GET MORE DISTRIBUTIVE TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THAT GO INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND CIRCULATE WITH IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. BECAUSE MOST OF OUR TRAVEL IS WITHIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IN THIS I HAVE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE THERE'S NO HEALTHCARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD I GOT TO GO TO A BIG BOX OUT IN ROCKLIN IN ANOTHER PLACE. SO BY HAVING THIS TYPE OF HOUSING. THAT IS SUPPORTED BY A MORE NIMBLE TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION. I CAN QUALIFY FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AND GET THE HOUSING I NEED YOU MY COMPLETE STREETS PROJECT. TO MAKE THAT SYNCHRONICITY STREETS. HOUSING PEOPLE WALK WALK ABILITY EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT TO SEE THE DOWNTOWN EXPERIENCE THERE'S NO REASON YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. SOME REMEMBER RAMOS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON THE THE SOLAR ASPECT OF IT AND INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY HOW MUCH OF THAT WENT BACK INTO THE LOCAL -- COMMUNITY ITSELF AND DID THE END USERS IN THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY AND UP -- BENEFITING FROM THAT COMING BACK I AM VERY HAPPY YOU BROUGHT THIS QUESTION TEMAS TO THIS COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'RE HAVING IN ROLLING OUT THAT PROJECT. IS ACCESSING CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS. AS THE WAY CAP AND TRADE POLICIES ARE WRITTEN THEY'RE WRITTEN. FOR ALMOST LIKE A SUBSIDY TO THE HOUSEHOLD WHENEVER WE PUT UP A SOLAR ARRAY. IT HAS TO RESULT IN A DIRECT REDUCTION AND HOUSEHOLD UTILITY COSTS. NOW WHEN THE UTILITY COMPANY TAX ON A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE FOR THOSE PARTIES WE WIPE OUT THE WE BY ABOUT THE SAVINGS. WHICH MEANS WE CANNOT PROVIDE THAT SERVICE. AND ALSO WHEN WE FOCUS ON THE RATHER THAN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE GRASS DON'T ALLOW US TO AGGREGATE THE ENERGY BUT RATHER AS THE INTERNET WANT A SUBSIDY TO THE HOUSEHOLD SO YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUILD THAT NEIGHBORHOOD INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO GO SEEK PRIVATE FINANCING FOR THIS. AT A HIGHER INTEREST RATE. THAN WHAT I WAS BE GETTING FROM -- THE STATE ON CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS. SO EVEN THOUGH THE THE MODEL SEEMS TO BE WORKING YOU HAVE -- SOLAR PANELS COMING UP TENSION WIRES OF I UNDERSTOOD IT CORRECTLY NOT YES THAT'S AT THAT THE MENTION THE PARKING LOT CANOPY WHO WERE AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER THAT WERE THE AND THE THE NEIGHBORHOOD GETTING THE DISTRIBUTIVE ENERGY STILL AS A COMPONENT THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON SO THAT. THE END RESULT IS THERE IN THE NAVY IS THERE THE IDEA NOW IS HOW DO WE CHANGE THIS DIALOGUE THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY HAS TO GO TO A HOUSEHOLD. RATHER THAN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE LEGISLATION SAYS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IT DOES NOT SAY DISADVANTAGED HOUSEHOLD. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WE LOSE THESE INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN THIS OVER AS A SUBSIDY TO THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S DOING OF GREAT INJUSTICE. IF WE CAN TOUCH ON TRACKING PROGRESS IN MEASURING WHAT MATTERS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD DO AS A STATE TO MODIFY EXISTING OR A DOT NEW. METRICS THAT TRACK PROGRESS SAID IT ENCOURAGE UPWARD MOBILITY IN AN AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. IF IF THE STATE. WOULD LIKE. TO CHAU WHO ITS PROGRESS. WE REALLY NEED TOMORROW MARCH OR WHERE THE MONEY ACTUALLY CUTS HOW MUCH OF THIS CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS ACTUALLY HIT NEIGHBORHOODS. NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE DOING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT THAT ONE DEVELOPER GETS BUT HOW DO THESE PROJECTS REALLY HIT THE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE THEY GIVING ME THE HOUSING PRODUCTS THAT MY NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS. MY NEIGHBORHOOD DOESN'T NEED ANOTHER BIG BOX. APARTMENT COMPLEXES WHERE SOME OUTSIDE OWNER OWNS AND PULLS RENTS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I MEAN WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE KEY. IF WE CAN'T PROVIDE THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP PEOPLE LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE WANT THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP THAT'S AFFORDABLE. AND MEETS THE NEEDS THAT OF OF THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO COMPLEMENT THESE OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVITIES LIKE THE COMPLETE STREETS PROJECT TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS ENERGY PROJECTS THAT WERE PULLING THE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS THAT WOULD BRING IT. WELL TO STAY THERE. AND WE CAN'T KEEP IN THERE IS RENTERS. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE FUND. AND SUPPORT FINANCIALLY. HOUSING AT THE STATE LEVEL WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE TYPES OF HOUSING PRODUCTS WE ARE SUPPORTING. ARE WE SUPPORTING THE TYPES OF HOUSING PRODUCTS. THAT ACTUALLY BRING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES INTO THIS NEW INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE. NOT SEEN ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU DOCTOR HERNANDEZ YOUR PHONINESS TODAY. AND I LOOK FOR TO CERTAINLY WORKING WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE SESSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WONDERFUL SO GIVEN THAT WE ARE EXTREMELY WELL ON TIME TODAY -- I WILL GO AHEAD AND BRING UP OUR NEXT PANEL I TWO PRESENTS IF YOU CAN PLEASE JOIN US AT THE TABLE. WE HAVE DR. LOUIS SAID THAT'S WORTH. THROUGH BOW HAND AND LAURIE BERMAN. IN THIS FINAL PANEL WE ARE GOING TO DELVE MORE DEEPLY INTO EXISTING PROGRAMS I CAN SUPPORTER UPWARD MOBILITY. AN INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC SECURITY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE'S OTHER CORE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION. DIVERSIFICATION OF THE STATE'S ENERGY SOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT WHAT'S DRIVING IT TOWARD THESE GOALS THESE PROGRAMS CAN ALSO. PROVIDE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES TO ELEMENT IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP WE WILL ALSO LEARN HOW AT THE MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY LEVEL THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HAD TO EVOLVE IN ORDER TO ENSURE A DIVERSE RANGE OF BUSINESSES. GRANTEES IN NEIGHBORHOODS CAN BENEFIT WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO WELCOME EACH OF YOU -- TO TODAY'S HEARING WE HAVE LOUISE VETS FURRED DOCTOR BEDS FOR ITS EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL WITH US THROUGH BOTH HAND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND LAURIE BERMAN DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. HOW WE LOOK FORTY HEARING FROM EACH OF YOU -- WE VALUE OUR WITNESSES PRESENTATIONS AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE AN OFFER GREAT INSIGHT TO TO US TODAY ON HOW ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND WORKFORCE. TRAINING ARE BEING INTEGRATED WITHIN THE EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO ADVANCE A PROSPEROUS AND MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. I LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE EACH OF YOU WITH THIS TODAY AND WE CAN GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH DOCTOR BUT IT'S WORTH. GREAT THANK YOU -- GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S LOUISE BEDS WORTH TIME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL -- AND THAT PRESENTATION ACTUALLY WAS A VERY NICE LEAD IN -- TWO AND I'LL TALK ABOUT TODAY -- BUT I'LL START JUST WITH A BIT OF BACKGROUND -- THE CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH STATE STATUTE IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO SUPPORT THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE COUNCIL IS MADE UP OF TEN MEMBERS WE HAVE SIX CABINET SECRETARIES OF REPRESENTING SIX AGENCIES THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND THREE PUBLIC MEMBERS ONE APPOINTED BY. THE ASSEMBLY OF THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR. AND OUR COUNCIL CHAIRED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. SO AS YOU SEE THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WORKS THROUGH ITS MEMBERS AND IT'S AGENCIES TO ACHIEVE IN ADVANCE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO SHAPE -- HOW AND WHERE WE'RE GROWING AND TO ACHIEVE HEALTHY EQUITABLE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AND LANDSCAPES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS -- WE REALIZE THIS VISION THROUGH COLLABORATIVE POLICY INITIATIVES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING AND COMMUNITIES. AND INVESTMENT AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT LINK TRANSPORTATION HOUSING AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS -- THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT ALSO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ACT EQUITY OUTCOMES. M. THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR WORK WE EMPHASIZE -- AND FOCUS ON SUPPORTING LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SINCE ITS CREATION THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCILS INVESTED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN PLANNING AND PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE -- THAT HAVE RESULTED IN SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING PROJECTS AND OVER HALF OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO REALLY CENTRAL TO ACHIEVING OUR VISION AT STC AS THAT ALL POP COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION -- AND BENEFIT FROM INVESTMENT BUT ALSO REALLY IMPORTANTLY THAT WERE EMPOWERING AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES DEVELOP THEIR OWN VISION OF PROSPEROUS EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. AND THAT TOGETHER WE CAN REALIZE OUR GOALS. SO WE LEAD WORK IN SEVERAL AREAS -- INCLUDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM I MENTIONED WE ALSO DO A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- BUT TODAY I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT OUR TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAMS I THINK IT REALLY SPEAKS TO A LOT OF THAT -- THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING. THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH WE HEARD A BIT ABOUT A PLANNING GRANT THAT'S UNDER WAY HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN THE FRANKLIN BOULEVARD AREA -- THIS TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMBING COMMITTEES PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH STATE STATUTE IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN AND IT WAS DESIGNED TO REALIZE ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS TO THE STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- TRANSFERRED OF CLIMATE COMMUNITIES MAKES LARGE INVESTMENTS IN INTER CONNECTED TO SETS OF PROJECTS AT A NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE A LOCAL VISIONS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT A COMMUNITY LED VISION FOR TRANSFORMATION. SO REALLY COMES FROM THE GROUND UP -- TRANSFORM A CLIMATE COMMUNITIES IS FUNDED THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND. AND IT IS DESIGNED TO CATALYZE TRANSFORMATION SO IT IS REALLY INTENDED TO BE A SEED. THROUGH WHICH WE CAN -- LEVERAGE OTHER INVESTMENT ON THE STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN AREAS THAT HAVE FOLK HAVE EXPERIENCE HISTORIC UNDER INVESTMENT -- AND DISCONNECTION. SO WE'VE CONDUCTED TWO ROUNDS OF THE PROGRAM TODAY -- AM THROUGH EACH ROUND WE HAVE IMPORTED A SMALL SET OF IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS AND PLANNING GRANTS -- IN BOTH OF THESE ROUNDS WE FOCUSED ON THE TOP 5% OF MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AS DEFINED BY COUNTY VIRUS SCREEN. I WE'VE AWARDED FIVE IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS WHICH I'LL TOUCH ON AND THEN ALSO FOURTEEN PLANNING GRANTS -- OF WHICH THAT FRANKLIN BOULEVARD NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECT IS AN EXAMPLE. THE PROGRAM IS REALLY BEEN REALLY THOUGHTFULLY DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND AS I SAID REALLY IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT A COMMUNITY LEAD TO VISION -- BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE -- THE PROGRAM IS ALSO BEEN DESIGNED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ALL COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. AND THEN ULTIMATELY TO A WARRANTIES THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE WE PROVIDE TO HELP ON IMPLEMENTATION -- SO TO DATE ARE WARDS HAVE RANGED FROM TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS UP TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS. EACH AWARD IS UNIQUE BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED IT'S DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A COMMUNITY -- IT BUT IT IN THAT IS DEVELOPED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE STAKEHOLDER STRUCTURE SO TO DATE WE'VE INVESTED IN FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS SCALE INVESTMENTS -- ONE IN FRESNO -- WHERE THEY WERE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FOCUS ON PROJECTS IN WEST AND SOUTHWEST FRESNO? THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE WATTS NEIGHBORHOOD IN LOS ANGELES -- TO SUPPORT REDEVELOPMENT OF THE JORDAN DOWNS HOUSING PROJECT AND THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONTARIO TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT IN DOWNTOWN ON TERRIO THROUGH AN INITIATIVE CALLED ON TERRIO TOGETHER. THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR AROUND ONE AWARDS IN WHICH WE AWARDED JUST UNDER A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE AWARDED OUR ROUNDS TWO AWARDS ONE TWO SACRAMENTO IN THAT TWIN RIVERS AREA FOCUSED AROUND THE DOSE RIOS LIGHT RAIL STATION. AND THEN ONE TYPICAL EMMA -- TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY LED WORK THAT'S BEEN -- UNDER WAY AND THAT COMMUNITY FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- SO EACH AS I MENTION EACH PROGRAM EACH PROJECT IS UNIQUE AND EXACTLY WHAT THE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON COMMON ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE. EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES FROM THESE INVESTMENTS. FIRST IS EVERY PROJECT IS CENTERED AROUND A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PLAN -- SO THEY NOTED EVERY AND AT THE HEART OF IT IS THIS COMMUNITY LED DIVISION. AND SO EACH APPLICANT MUST OUTLINED HOW THE COMMUNITY HAS BEING BEEN ENGAGED LEADING UP TO AND THEN FOLLOWING THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AWARD. AND IN THE PROJECT AND WE PROVIDE -- A LOT OF ASSISTANCE MANY OF THEM ARE DOING THAT ARE READY BUT AGAIN PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO HELP THEM TO DEVELOP. THE RESOURCES AND APPROACHES TO DO THAT. EACH APPLICANT -- NEEDS TO DEVELOP A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN SO -- TO SHOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS INVESTMENT -- TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES AND THIS IS IN SOME CASES THIS INCLUDES LOCAL HIGHER REQUIREMENTS WHERE WE'RE SEEING JOB TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY COMPLETE THE FUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS -- IN OTHER AREAS WE'VE SEEN -- APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN BUSINESS INCUBATOR SERVICES. AND WE WORK WITH THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD ON THAT ASPECT. IN ADDITION REALLY IN CENTRAL TO THIS -- EACH PROJECT IS ALSO SO IN -- THAT THESE INVESTMENTS IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS BENEFIT THE PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THAT LIVE THERE. NOW -- AND WILL STAY IN THE FUTURE -- EACH APPLICANT MUST DEVELOP AN ANTI DISPLACEMENT PLAN THAT OUTLINES POLICIES AND PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO PREVENT DISPLACEMENT OF RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES -- AND AGAIN WE WORK WITH EACH OF THEM -- AROUND THAT. AND THEN FINALLY EACH -- APPLICATION EACH PROJECT IS REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST 50% LEVERAGE INVESTMENT -- AND SO WE ASK FOR IT THAT IS TIED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS IN THE PRIDE AND THE INVESTMENT AREA. SO FOR OUR FUTURE SKEWS ME THROUGH OUR FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF THE PROGRAM WE'VE INVEST INVESTED JUST OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. IN THESE FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS BUT IF SEEN ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND LEVERAGE INVESTMENT THAT'S TIED TO OTHER PROJECTS IN WITH IN OUR PROJECT AREAS. ARE PROJECT AREA IS FOCUS AT A NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE SO AN AREA OF LESS THAN FIVE SQUARE MILES. TO REALLY ENSURE THAT YOU'RE SEEING THE SYNERGIES AND BY -- JUST NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE -- INTO AN EXISTING PROGRAMS THE THEY DON'T HAVETHE TRANSPORTATION AMENITIES ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS OTHER STATE FUNDS. SO IN MANY CASES THIS INITIAL INVESTMENT IS SETTING THEM UP TO BE MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE FOR FUTURE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE SACRAMENTO AWARD WE JUST MADE -- WHERE WERE A LOT OF OUR INVESTMENTS GOING INTO THE DOES RIOS LIGHT RAIL STATION WHICH WILL MAKE THEM HAVE A HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT CONNECTION? THAT WILL MAKE THEM MORE COMPETITIVE FOR OTHER AWARDS -- AND SO. THIS PROGRAM TO US IS REALLY ONE WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITIES -- AS I MENTIONED WE'VE DEVELOPED -- WE ALSO PROVIDE PLANNING GRANTS WE'VE AWARDED. PLANNING GRANTS BETWEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FOURTEEN COMMUNITIES -- AND WE HAVE EXPANDED THAT TO BE NOT JUST THE TOP 5% OF MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT IT ALSO. EXTENDS THE TOP 25% OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THE INTENTION THERE IS THAT WE'RE CREATING A PIPELINE OF PROJECTS IN PROVIDING CAPACITY FOR THIS PLANNING TO HAPPEN ON THE GROUND -- WITH HOPES THAT WITH AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABILITY WE WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE MORE NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE STATE -- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ONCE WE GET TO THAT POINT. WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH SO WE CAN OPEN IT UP TO TO TASK QUESTIONS OF THE ENTIRE PANEL. BUT THERE'S ANY MEDIA QUESTIONS WE CAN HOLD. ALL RIGHT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO DIRECTOR BELL HAN OF FOR THE NEXT PRESENTATION. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US THIS MORNING WE'RE PLEASED TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. AND I WON I CREDIT YOUR STAFF FOR AN EXCELLENT STAFF REPORT I'VE READ MY SHARE OF THEM AND WHEN I GOT IT YESTERDAY OF COURSE TURNED QUICKLY TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION PORTION BUT SPENT LAST NIGHT AFTER MY KIDS WENT TO BED READING THE REST OF IT AND I I LEARNED. AN AWFUL LOT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- BROADLY. THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS TRYING TO DO TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE RELEVANT TO THE COMMITTEE'S A FEW FEW OTHERS BUT I THINK BROADLY. TO AND THOSE ARE HOW DO WE MAKE THE CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION SOMETHING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PART OF AND ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF AND THE SECOND ONE IS HOW ARE WE CONTRIBUTED TO JOBS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED. BUSINESS ENTERPRISE OR OR PARTICIPATE DISPENSED COMMITTEES ARE ABLE TO GET JOBS THAT ARE A PART OF THIS THIS CLEAN ENERGY CHANGE WERE ALL EXPERIENCING. SO THOSE ARE BROADLY WHAT WE'RE AFTER WE ARE OUR FORMAL COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY GOES BACK -- QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE ADOPTED A POLICY AT OUR OUR COMMISSIONS ADOPTED IN IT IT TARGETS -- IT ESTABLISH A POLICY PROVIDING FAIR AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN AND BENEFIT FROM. ENERGY COMMISSION PROGRAMS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. FAST FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT ADOPTION IN AB EIGHT SIXTY FIVE WAS PASSED IN IT. BASICALLY PUT IN LAW WHAT I JUST STATED IN TERMS OF THE THE THE TARGETS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE SIGNED IT WERE WERE AFTER. IN WHAT WHAT -- HOW WE IMPLEMENT THIS IS WE OPENED A PROCEEDING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN NOT LONG AFTER THE BILL PASSED AND WE PUT OUR PUBLIC ADVISORS OFFICE KIND OF IN THE DEAD THE LEAD IN CHARGE OF IT? IN SO HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD A PUBLIC ADVISORS OFFICE THAT WAS IN PLACE TO TAKE -- PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUTRAGE TO COMMUNITIES WHERE POWER PLANTS WERE BEING BUILT SO. BACK TO THE ENERGY CRISIS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE LEGISLATURE SOFFIT TO CREATE AN ENTITY THE ENERGY COMMISSION. TO BE THE LONE ENTITY THAT DOES ALL THE PERMITTING ASSOCIATED WITH A POWER PLANT. IN. WE REALIZED THEY REALIZE BACK THEN IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC WAS PARTICIPATING BECAUSE TYPICALLY LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THAT IS NOT. ENTIRELY WELCOME IN ALL COMMUNITIES SO WILL -- THAT PROCESS STARTED IN IT SINCE THEN THE PUBLIC ADVISE ROLE IS GROWN AND SO THAT ROLE IS NOW -- THAT THAT THE CENTER OF OUR ACTIVITIES -- IN THIS AREA. IN WHAT -- WE HAVE A PUBLIC ADVISER -- AND WHAT WHAT SHE DOES IN HER TEAM DOES IS IS LARGELY OUTRAGE SO WE TRIED IT WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND I WANT TO GET INTO A COUPLE OF OUR MAJOR FUNDING PROGRAMS AS YOU. YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE WEEDS -- BUT TRY TO GET OUT THERE ON THE FRONT END AND LET FOLKS KNOW HEY WE'VE GOT -- A CHUNK OF FUNDING THAT MAY BE SOMETHING YOU OR YOUR CONSTITUENTS OR YOUR MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY GROUPS OF WHATEVER THE FOLKS ARE IN THIS IS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THE CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HERE. BAY AREA -- THIS IS COMING UP IS A SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IT'S WE WORK HARD WITH WITH WITH MAKING REALLY SOLID CONNECTIONS WITH FOLKS -- AND THEY HAD AND AND THAT'S AGAIN THE THE POP OUR PUBLIC ADVISER REALLY. REALLY FOCUS ON THAT STRATEGIC PLAN WE HAVE MEETINGS -- OF OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM THE LAST FRIDAY OF EVERY MONTH SHE HOSTS THOSE AND WE TALK AMONGST OURSELVES AND SAY WHAT WE DOING WELL WHAT WE DON'T POORLY HOW CAN WE IMPROVE -- SO IT'S IT'S REALLY BEEN A COMMITMENT FOR US. TO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR TWO MAJOR PROGRAMS ONE IS CALLED EPIC AND THE OTHER ONE IS -- IN SEARCH OF A BETTER NAME BUT IT'S CURRENTLY CALLED THE A. R. F. VTP THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE VEHICLE -- FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. I WOULD HELP THE ONE EIGHTEEN PROGRAM BECAUSE AB TEAM WAS THE BILL THAT THAT IT'S DOLLARS PER YEAR -- RESEARCH AND THE THE CALL THE EIGHTY ONE EIGHTEEN PROGRAM THE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM INVEST ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. AND THE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INCLUDE IT GET MEETING WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS PUBLIC WORKSHOPS WECREATED EASY TO READ MORE MULTI LINGUAL INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS AND WE'VE GOT A HOW TO APPLY FOR RESEARCH FUNDING VIDEO. AND WE BRING THESE THINGS OVER WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SHARE BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF IS -- IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN -- AN APPLICANT -- WHICH I HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO FOR PUBLIC FUNDING IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT EASY TO NAVIGATE SO THE IDEA IS TO CREATE TOOLS THAT MAKE IT. NOT QUITE SO DAUNTING -- THEN WE CONDUCT SURVEYS ON THE BACK AND THE TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING SO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A RECENT SURVEY WE DID FOR FOR EPIC THE RESEARCH PIECE. AND WHAT WE LEARNED IN REACHING OUT TO FOLKS WAS THE 38% OF OUR EPIC AGREEMENTS INCLUDE WOMEN MINORITY DISABLED VETERAN OR LGBT OWNED. BUSINESSES AS HE THAT THE PRIME OR SUBCONTRACTOR. AND 55% OF THOSE SAME EPIC AGREEMENTS INCLUDE A SMALL BUSINESS OR IS A PRIME OR A SUBCONTRACTOR. THAT IS HOW IT ONE OTHER PROJECT THAT IS KIND OF A DIFFERENT AREA WERE WERE TRYING -- TO IT. MAKE THESE -- IN ROADS INTO INTO COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS CALLED KELSEY. AND THAT WAS A PART OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM AGAIN THIS IS RESEARCH AND WHAT IT DOES IS PROVIDE SMALL GRANTS HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAX. TO TO SMALL ENTREPRENEURS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT GIVEN MONEY THAT THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO COME BY AT AN EARLY STAGE BECAUSE THE V. SEASON THE PRIVATE EQUITIES AND AND TRADITIONAL BANKING. DON'T SEE THE THE VALUE IN IT AND IT'S IT'S HIGH RISK AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THIS HIGH RISK WHEN WE DO IT BUT WE KEEP. THE WORD SMALL THEY DO WELL THEN THEY CAN GET FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANTS TO REALLY TRY TO MOVE TO THE NEXT STAGE WITH CREDITS WHOLE ECOSYSTEM TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. TO THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE -- I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBERS EXACTLY TO MORNING AND AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS IS VERY EASY TO GET. TO TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE SOME OF OUR LARGER AWARDS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF LEG WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -- IN IN IT. THIS PARTICULAR SEE PROGRAM WE CALL CAL SEED IS WE SET A MINIMUM FUNDING TARGET FOR UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS SUCH AS MINORITY WOMEN IN LGBT ON BUSINESSES. AND THAT'S THAT'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THE THE THE FOLKS WHO MANAGE THAT FUND LOOK FOR THOSE LOOK FOR THOSE TARGETS. SHIFTING TO THE AB ONE EIGHTEEN THE TRANSPORTATION FUND -- WANT TO FOCUS ON A LITTLE BIT MORE ON AND THE THE THE WORK FORCE ASPECT. TO DATE WE'VE INVESTED JUST SHY OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS PROGRAM -- WITH A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF OF ACTIVITIES WE FOUGHT WE FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE FUND -- USAGI WAS STAFF WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. ROUGHLY HALF OF THE COUNTRY'S AVERAGE BY WAY OF COMPARISON CHINA'S ADDING ABOUT A MILLION A YEAR -- LATELY SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING QUITE WELL IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT OTHERS WE CAN LOOK TO IS A LOAD STAR FOR HOW. TO HOW TO REALLY SUCCEED IN THIS AREA. SO THOUSAND PUBLIC CHARGERS RIGHT NOW ABOUT ANOTHER AT LEAST THAT MANY AND IN PRIVATE SHARED -- IN SITUATIONS LIKE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING GOOGLE INTEL THESE BIG EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FOR THEIR THEIR THEIR WORKFORCE. AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT THIRTY NINE HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS SO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS A PART OF WHAT WE FUND -- IN IN ADDITION WE FUND BIOFUELS IN A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER ACTIVITIES BUT WITH ALL THIS THIS -- NEW YOU KNOW CHANGES IN THE WAY WE VIEW OURSELVES FROM PLACE TO PLACE WE NEED A SKILLED WORKFORCE TO HELP BUILD THIS BILL THESE THINGS AND WRITE THE SOFTWARE AND ALL THE ALL THE PARTS THAT GO WITH THAT. SO WE'VE INVESTED OF THAT AMOUNT I DESCRIBE THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR INTO -- INTO THIS KIND OF TRAINING. AND WE ARE NOT EXPERTS IN THIS AREA SO WE RELY HEAVILY ON OUR FRIENDS AT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THE EMPLOYMENT -- TRAINING PANEL THE DIVISION OF A BRITISH SHIP STANDARDS WE WORK AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES OTHERS TO TRY -- TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE TARGET THE RIGHT FOLKS WOULD WANT TO PROVIDE TRAINING FIRST FOLKS WERE THERE ANY JOBS IN THE BACK AND WE WANT TO ACTUALLY GET LOCATION RIGHT AND AND IT'S BEEN. A GREAT NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIPS WE'VE HAD WITH THEM TODAY WE SINCE WE'VE TRAINED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOLKS IN THE STATE. AT THAT TO ANSWER ME SEVEN BUSINESSES IT'S NOT JUST BUSINESSES AND SCHOOLS BUT TO ANSWER THE SEVEN BUSINESSES OF ALSO RAN -- BEEN TOUCHED ONE OF THESE WE DID IS WE FUNDED REGIONAL ENERGY WE CALL THEM REGIONAL INDUSTRY CLUSTER PLANNING GRANTS SOME IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE -- WE WANTED TO PROVIDE FUNDING SO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN HELP US FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE WHERE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WOULD BE MOST SUITED FOR THIS WITH HER HIGH SCHOOLS WE GO -- TO THE CURRENT WORK FORCE TO LOOK AT OTHER LEVELS OF EDUCATION AND AGAIN GET A LOT OF HELP FROM FOLKS THAT DO THIS -- DO THIS EVERY DAY. AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST MENTION A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS -- IN ADDITION TO JUST DIRECT WORKFORCE TRAINING WE'VE ALSO SOME OF OUR FUNDING HAS THEN SPURRED ADDITIONAL JOB SO ONE I WOULD POINT TO APPROACH -- THE THE THE ECONOMICS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC ELECTRIC BUSES VERSES DIESEL BUSES IS VERY FAVORABLE SO WE'VE GOT. THINK THREE WE GOT TO I THINK A THIRD MAY HAVE OPENED TO BUS MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT MANUFACTURE ELECTRIC BUSES THESE ARE GOOD HIGH PAYING MANUFACTURING JOBS -- AND WITH THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT THE THE THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY ODDS PICK ONE PRO TERRA NOW HAS A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES A RECEIVING UP REALLY GOOD BENEFITS LIVE AND LET LIVE IN THE BAY AREA SO. WORK WE'RE QUITE PROUD OF THIS ONE I'VE GOT A LIST BUT I'LL PRINT INTEREST FROM -- JUST MENTION THAT ONE AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SAME TEAM ARE TRANSPORTATION TEAM RECEIVED SOME MONEY FROM PROP THIRTY NINE SOME YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE. INVESTED ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO PUT MONEY INTO SCHOOLS TO UPGRADE LIGHTING AN H. BACK AND CONTROLS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. AND THERE WAS SOME MONEY LEFT OVER AT THE END ABOUT. A HUNDRED MILLION AND SO WE WERE DIRECTED TO TAKE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OF THAT AND PUT IT INTO ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S WE'VE GOT A SOLICITATION IN THE STREET TWO OF THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR THE SCHOOLS ONE FOR THE BUS MANUFACTURERS THEY WERE GONNA TRY TO PARTNER THE TO GET A GOOD BALK DISCOUNT DEAL ON THE ON THE BUSES THEMSELVES. AND THEN HAVE -- SCHOOLS APPLY FOR FUNDING IN WERE THAT THE CRITERIA ARE BASICALLY FORCED BUSES THE DEAN OF THE MOST. BOB. POLLUTING DIESEL BUSES ARE GONNA BE THE THE OTHER THE ONES THAT ARE WILL BE THE THE THE THE THE THE PRIMARY TARGETS. SO -- THIS IS BEEN A PROGRAM THAT -- IS SYSTEM IS ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HAVE THE JOBS TO TO TO TO MAINTAIN THE BUSES. BILLION INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THEM AND AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS I THINK I'LL AND THEREIN THANK YOU AGAIN. FANTASTIC I DO ACTUALLY WANT TO FOLLOW UP VERY QUICKLY OR MENTION ELECTRIC BUS MANUFACTURERS WHERE ELSE IN THE STATE ARE THEY LOCATED. SO THE PRO TEARS IN THE BAY AREA I HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING -- B. Y. DE THE OTHER ONE I'M CERTAIN IS IN CALIFORNIA THERE IN -- IT'LL A VALLEY OF LANCASTER. CALIFORNIA SO IT'S ABOUT. HOUR AND A HALF NORTH OF LOS ANGELES NORTHWEST. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE AT THIS MOMENT. UNDER FOR SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE WITH THAT THIS PIANO AND WE'D LOVE TO GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE WITH. OUR DIRECTOR [inaudible] DOCTOR BERMAN. DIRECT YOUR BERMAN EXCUSE ME THANK YOU THE OF GOOD MORNING MISS CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAURIE BERMAN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CALTRANS AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT HOW IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE CALTRANS CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. CALTRANS HAS COMPLETED NINETY PROJECTS SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL AND WE HAVE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MORE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT I'LL GET OUT TO CONSTRUCTION -- WE'RE NOT JUST IMPROVING PAVEMENT AND BRIDGES WE ARE ALSO IMPROVING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE.

CALTRANS CONTINUES TO HOST STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL SMALL BUSINESS COUNCILS WITH DIVERSE MEMBERSHIPS REPRESENTING MULTI CULTURAL AND MULTI ETHNIC TRADE ORGANIZATIONS CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND OTHER GROUPS. THESE COUNCILS ENCOURAGE SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION ON CALTRANS CONTRACTS AND PROVIDE VALUABLE FORMS FOR US TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK ABOUT OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AFFECTING SMALL BUSINESS. SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE PLACED ADVERTISEMENTS IN SEVEN LANGUAGES IN OVER SEVENTY FIVE PUBLICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO CALL ATTENTION TO OUR UPCOMING CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES.

CALTRANS IS COMMITTED TO FOSTERING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL SMALL BUSINESSES COMPETING FOR CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES. INCLUDING BUSINESSES OWNED BY UNDER REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS. STATE LAW SETS A GOAL FOR CALTRANS TO AWARD 25% OF STATE FUNDED CONTRACTS AND PROCUREMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS WE CLEARLY EXCEEDED THIS GOAL LAST QUARTER WITH A SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION RATE OF THIRTY FOUR POINT 3%. STATE LAW ALSO SETS A GOAL FOR DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION OF 3% OF STATE FUNDED CONTRACTS AND PROCUREMENTS. LAST QUARTER WE ALSO EXCEEDED THIS GOAL WITH A PARTICIPATION RATE OF THREE POINT 4%. I'M EXCITED TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY EXCEEDED BOTH OF THESE GOALS IN EACH OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS. EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFLUX OF SB. ONE STARTING THIS YEAR OUR GOAL IS TO AWARD SEVENTEEN POINT 6% OF CONTRACTS. FUNDED THROUGH THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION TO CERTIFIED DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES THIS GOAL WAS SET TO A DISPARITY STUDY OF OUR FEDERAL HIGHWAY PROGRAM. SO FAR IN THIS FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR WE HAVE ATTAINED A PARTICIPATION RATE OF SEVENTEEN POINT 26%. THIS IS INCREDIBLE GROWTH FROM PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN OUR DISPARITY SET THE GOAL AT TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT. CALTRANS IS ALSO CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A DISPARITY STUDY FOR CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION. WITH SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE DUE TO SB ONE WE NEED TO FOSTER SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND WE NEED TO GROWTH. GIVES ME THE CONTRACT WORKFORCE TO DO THIS WE ARE PARTNERING WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. TO PROVIDE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS. IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WE HAVE CONTRACTED DIRECTLY WITH THE FIELD IRONWORKERS APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING PROGRAM TO RECRUIT WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ENGAGED WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES THANK YOU. AND LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE TO OFFER A LETTERS OF OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN IN OTHER DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS IN THE HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND PROVIDES PRE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING. CALTRANS IS ALSO WORKED WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. TO CREATE THE SECOND CHANCE PROGRAM. THIS PROVIDES ON THE JOB TRAINING OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. TWENTY OF THESE PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN HIRED AS PERMANENT CALTRANS EMPLOYEES AND PARTICIPANTS SECURE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM. CALTRANS HAS ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION THE BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT. TO THE PAROLE THE WORK PROGRAM. WE HAVE FIFTY FOUR CREWS ACROSS THE STATE WAS SIX TO EIGHT PEOPLE PER CREW. CALTRANS HAS HIRED MORE THAN SEVENTY PERMANENT EMPLOYEES FROM THIS PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM ALSO BENEFITS ARE COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE AT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY CALTRANS PAROLE THE PROGRAM HAS A 9% RECIDIVISM RATE. COMPARED TO THE 52% RECIDIVISM RATE FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THESE EFFORTS SB ONE OH THREE REQUIRES CALTRANS TO FOCUS ITS OUTREACH EFFORTS ON INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW AND LIMITED CONTRACTING. SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISES CALTRANS SMALL BUSINESS OUT REACH PLAN DESCRIBES HOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW. AND INCREASE PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING THOSE OWNED BY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. CALTRANS IS WORKING TO INCORPORATE ELEMENTS OF THE OUTRAGE PLAN INTO OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AND INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION OF NEW AND LIMITING CONTRACTING SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. CALTRANS IS ALSO WORKING TO IMPROVE INTERNAL DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR PARTICIPATION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU ON THESE EFFORTS AND WE'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED IN OUR FUTURE REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAKER TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU AYE AYE IT'S VERY EXCITING TO HAVE EACH OF YOU HERE TODAY -- THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SAID THE COMMISSION'S ORGANIZATION JUST TO TOUCH ON THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE EXISTING AND HOW. FOLKS HAVE TAPPED INTO THOSE EXIST I HAD A QUESTION REGARDING II GOVERNMENT PLATFORMS -- JUST TECHNO TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE AND THIS GIVEN AGE YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE REALLY. ADDRESSING THIS WITHIN EACH OF YOUR DEPARTMENTS. ARE HOW OUR FOLKS ACCESSING YOUR PROGRAMS. THROUGH THOSE VARIOUS METHODS. AND MAYBE COULD ALSO TOUCH ON INITIATIVES. FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES. TO IF GOVERNMENT CORRECT. I MEAN WE DO A LOT OF WORK OVERALL JUST IN TERMS OF SORT OF DOING DIRECT OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES WORK SHOPPING WITH COMMUNITY SINCE WE MANY OUR APPLICANTS TEND TO BE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- SO WE SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME ACTUALLY OUT IN COMMUNITIES WORKING ONE ON ONE TO TALK THROUGH. DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES -- WE DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE PLATFORM THAT WE USE FOR ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS -- BUT WE JUST WE DO HAVE A VERY ROBUST ADAM OUT REACH AND NETWORK OF OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL APPLICANTS. IS -- MAYBE YOU COULD ALSO TOUCH ON ARE THERE ANY. SMARTER REGULATIONS TO REDUCE IMPEDIMENTS TO ACCESSING THESE PROGRAMS. I MEAN I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED IT OFTEN THESE PROGRAMS ARE -- ARE CHALLENGING IN TERMS AS AT ONE THING THAT IS NICE ABOUT THAT THAT TRANSFORMED OF CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM IS IT PROVIDES A WAY. FOR A COMMUNITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FOR MULTIPLE TYPES OF PROJECTS SO RIGHT NOW OTHERWISE YOU WOULD GO TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THROUGH THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM THROUGH A SINGLE APPLICATION YOU CAN ACCESS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS TYPES -- I THINK WHAT WE HAVE FOUND ESPECIALLY WITH -- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES IS REALLY DOING THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- AND WE'VE WORKED WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO DO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR PROGRAMS AS WELL. HAS A LOT OF BENEFIT AND WE'VE SEEN IT -- WORK IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS WILL DO DIRECT APPLICATION ASSISTANCE WORK WITH FOLKS A WE ALSO WILL WORK TO TRAIN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO BE A RESOURCE ON THE GROUND FOR DIFFERENTPROGRAMS -- AND SO WE'VE SEEN REACHING UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES DOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING -- IS IS BEEN EXT REALLY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THAT IS OFTEN A BIG NEED -- AND AND LIKE I SAID THERE'S A NUMBER OF MODELS FOR HOW TO DO THAT. AND I THINK YOU'RE SEEING INCREASING USE OF TECHNO Và OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MODELS BUT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE. PLEASE TO HEAR. SO I WOULD JUST AT ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO WE CREATED AN E. FILING SYSTEM SO IT USED TO BE THAT WE GET LITERALLY BANKERS BOXES FULL OF APPLICATIONS BECAUSE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THAT YOU PROVIDE TEN COPIES OF THAT OUR SCORING TEAM WITH EACH OF A COPY. AND WE GOT A FEW COMPLAINTS AND WE YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW IT'S A COST ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO PRINT MAIL THE STUFF TO YOU GUYS VERSUS HITTING SEND WITH -- PDF SO WE CHANGED AND NOW FOLKS CAN OF APPLY ELECTRONICALLY. FUNDAMENTAL AND THAT'S HELPED A LOT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF OUR STUFF IS COMPLICATED SO IF YOU WANT TO APPLY FOR A RESEARCH GRANT OR EVEN SOME OF THE APPLICATION -- WORK WE'RE DOING WHERE YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO TEST SOMETHING OUT YOU YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A REALLY HIGH DEGREE OF SOPHISTICATION SO WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO THERE IS MUCH MORE. IN A BOWL SCHOOL FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM GOING OUT MEET WITH FOLKS SHAKING HANDS -- IN FINDING PARTNERS WE CAN HELP THEM TRYING TO PAIR THEM SO WE CREATED SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS FOLKS TO THE LITTLE COMMUNITY THIS CREATED TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SO. YOU MAY BE REALLY GOOD AT THIS BUT YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT BUT TO REALLY SUBMIT A PACKAGE IT'S GOT A CHANCE OF WINNING IN THE BOWL THREE AND MANY MORE. THAT'S PART OF IT WE'VE ALSO GOT A COMMUNITY AND I'M SURE EACH OF MY COLLEAGUES DO AS WELL OF OF FOLKS WHO WILL ASSIST I WILL WRITE YOUR GRANT FOR YOU AND I'LL HELP YOU NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS IN EXCHANGE FOR A FEE YEAR. HOWEVER THAT WORKS SO TRY TO MAKE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS AS WELL -- BUT ON THE YOU KNOW THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE OF OUR GREAT BE COMPLICATED WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO LISTEN. BUT IT'S MOST OF AN ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS. SO IN THE AREA OF SMALL BUSINESS WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE ALSO HAVE SMALL BUSINESS COUNCILS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL AS ONE STATEWIDE SMALL BUSINESS COUNCIL AND SO. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY CAN LOOK TO FIND OUT UPCOMING DID SO WE POST ALL OF THE ARE PROJECTS THAT WILL BE OUT FOR BID. SO PEOPLE CAN FIND THAT INFORMATION ONLINE AND WE ALSO HAVE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THE CONTRACTORS BOOT CAMP. AND THEN -- ANOTHER THING THAT'S MORE RECENT WE HAVE CALTRANS HAS TWELVE DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE EACH DISTRICT. AS A RESULT OF SB ONE AS WELL AS OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM EACH JUST FULLY -- OF PROJECTS GENERALLY THERE'S GONNA BE SOME CHANGES OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS BUT CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS CAN LOOK AT THAT AND GET A SENSE OF WHERE THE WORK IS GOING TO BE AND WHAT TYPE OF WORK IT'LL BE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND I THINK -- THAT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD RESOURCES BOTH FOR PRIME CONTRACTORS AND FOR SMALL BUSINESSES JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IS THE STATE. THE RIGHT PLACE FOR ME TO TO INVEST MY TIME INTO LEARNING HOW TO DO BUSINESS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BERMAN. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER REAVIS.

THAT TOP 5% AREA. THANK YOU. AND THEN I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RECIDIVISM RATE -- WITH THE PROGRAM THAT'S BEING DONE I THINK IT CURRENTLY IN VALLEY. COUNTY IS THERE A WAY THAT WE COULD. LOOK AT EXPANDING THAT MODEL INTO OTHER AREAS OR IS IT ALREADY SOMETHING THAT'S BEING EXPLORED WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT TO EXPAND IT AND IT'S WE HAVE IT IN LA SACRAMENTO SANDIA GRAHAM. SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE FOLKS KNOW THAT THAT'S AN OPTION ON ON WAY TO ENHANCE OUR MAINTENANCE WORK FORCE. SURE HOW WE DO A BETTER JOB AT IN IN OUR DISTRICT AND THEN THE INLAND EMPIRE AREA OF BRINGING THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS UP. AS FAR AS CUTTING ON THE RECIDIVISM RATE THAT'S GOING ON LET ME CHECK. WITH THAT DISTRICT AND SEE IF WE'RE ALREADY USING IT AND AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF WE'RE NOT WE CAN TALK ABOUT ADDING THAT TO THE INLAND EMPIRE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MANAGER.

WHAT? I MEAN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY EXIST SO IT'S AWFUL HARD TO PERSUADE SOMEONE THAT THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA GOOD VALUE FOR THEIR FAMILY -- THE WAY TO SAVE FUNDS IF THEY DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SO LOTS OF CHALLENGES BUT OUR ROLE IS REALLY TO FOCUS MAINLY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT FOLKS DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION OF DO I REALLY WANT SOMETHING WHERE IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT.

AND REALLY GREAT HEARING I JUST WANTED -- TO YOU KNOW I'M VERY INTRIGUED ABOUT GREEN MORE. AND FOR THE SPDC AS A REMINDER YES -- CALIFORNIA'S FIVE REGIONS -- FOR FOR THE SPDC AND SO CONSIDER US -- A RESOURCE PARTNER AS YOU LOOK TO SEE HOW AN INCREASE HOUSE SMALL BUSINESS IS A PART OF THE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND I ALSO THINK THAT SMALL BUSINESS IS THE KEY SPOKEN TO THE WHEEL THAT WE'RE CREATING -- FOR AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY JUST REALLY QUICKLY FOR LAST YEAR'S ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR THE SB DC'S -- WE WERE PART OF CREATING OVER NINE THOUSAND JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOURTEEN HUNDRED BUSINESSES. AND FOR THIS COMMITTEE ALONE. ABOUT FORTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION IN NEW TAXABLE REVENUES IN YOUR DISTRICTS WAS TOUCHED BY -- THE SPDC AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND ADDING VALUE DON'T WANT WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT SOME. THE ONE WITHOUT FORCE AND INTO THE JOB CREATING FORCE WHICH IS SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SO THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING PAT FROM KUSHIDA I AM PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. LARGEST ETHNIC CHAMBER IN THE REGION WE REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF OVER. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND API BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I AM THE OLDEST LIVING CHAMBER EXECUTIVE EVER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WORKING WITH. MANY OF THE ENTITIES THAT WERE A PRETTY DAY AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE ENEMY VERY SUCCINCT ABOUT THIS. SO THEY TALKED ABOUT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE -- MADAM CHAIR YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE TECHNOLOGY TO START TO DO BETTER -- OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AROUND WHAT OPPORTUNITY IS OF A BILL WITH THEM. AND I DIDN'T SAY THEY DANCED AROUND THAT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTIONS YET SO AS AN EXAMPLE WE PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES WE CREATED A PLATFORM CALLED CONTRACT READINESS AND CONTRACT RAINY IS IS BASICALLY AN ONLINE PLATFORM WE CAN GO GET A CERTIFICATE áP TV. AFTER YOU'VE -- TAKEN THE COURT INDUCTION TO CERTIFICATION BECAUSE MANY OF OUR PARTICULAR MINORITY FIRMS. DON'T EVEN KNOW WITH THE FRONT DOOR IS AND SO I I SIT ON ALL THE COUNCIL'S THEY TALKED ABOUT ICE ON THE DIVERSITY COUNCIL FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION LISTEN ON CALTRANS. ICE NINETY GS. I SALUTE ALL OF THEM RIGHT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THOSE FRONT DOORS A VERY DIFFICULT TO WALK THROUGH. SO INTENTIONAL STRATEGIES ABOUT WE HOW WE CREATE PATHWAYS FOR THOSE FRONT DOORS TO BE OPENED SOMETHING AS SIMPLE. AS AN AS MEANINGFUL AS A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM I THINK WOULD GO FAR RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S AN INTRODUCTION RIGHT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ONE COMPANIES THAT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE THREE DEPEND HOW YOU LOOK AT IT HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO EVEN GET THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR. THEN YOU'VE GOT COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY GROWN TO THE SYSTEM AND THEY'RE STILL NOT ABLE TO BECOME A PRIME. RIGHT AND THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS AROUND THAT I LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO US ABOUT THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WE HAD HERE TODAY AND I LOOK REALLY FOR TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU THANK YOU. IN JUST A MINUTE WILL BE A GOOD MORNING SURE ARE CERVANTES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK HE'S JACKSON ON THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA. SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WHICH IS THE SPDC SOMEWHERE REPEAT A LITTLE BIT OF A ABOUT WHAT DAVIS SAID THE FIRST ALL. START WITH THIS SO LAST YEAR THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER RECEIVE HISTORIC FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM. WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO EXPAND OUR SERVICES AND PROVIDE HELP AND ASSISTANCE TO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT ARE FUN FROM LIMITED US TO SERVE IN THE PAST. AND DIFFERENT POPULATIONS -- OF PEOPLE LEARNING FROM THAT EXPANSION -- THANKS TO THE FUNDS THAT WERE RECEIVING SO -- I WANT TO BE A TOP PARTNER OF TO THE JEDI COMMITTEE AND ALSO THAT THE INDIVIDUAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS WEATHER IS -- LET YOU ALL KNOW WHAT WE LEARNED FROM PROVIDING THE SERVICES OR BRING IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN YOUR DISTRICT TO TALK WITH YOU ALL ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY ARE SEEING AND CHALLENGES THAT THEY NEED TO OVERCOME -- THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL THE FUNDING THAT THAT YOU ALL VOTED -- FOR AND IF THERE'S EVER SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THAT YOU SEE IS A ECONOMIC CONCERN -- PLEASE LET US KNOW AND WILL JUMP RIGHT.

OF FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER TODAY -- IT WAS SUCH A PLEASURE TO HEAR OUR NEW DIRECTOR OF COPAYS TALK ABOUT HIS PLANS AND WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- IN YOU KNOW MOVING CALIFORNIA FORWARD AND WE LOOK FORWARD AS SMALL BUSINESS CAL WITH YOU WORKING WITH COPAYS -- WE ARE PARTNER ARE ON A LOT OF PROJECTS WITH GOBIZ WE SUPPORT THEM WE SUPPORTED THEM I AM GETTING INCREASED FUNDING WE SUPPORT THERE ARE. PROGRAMS THAT THEY HELP -- SMALL BUSINESSES SO -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS THE SAYS SESSION MOVES ON THANK YOU. THE CHAIR CERVANTES A AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM HOLLY I'M WITH LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY -- AS YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A DIVERSE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY WOULD LOVE TO BE A RESOURCE TO YOU -- LAWRENCE BERKLEY LAB IS ONE OF THE SEVENTEEN DOE LABS WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S MANAGED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE KNOWN FOR OUR EXPERTISE IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY CLEAN ENERGY WATER -- PURIFICATION AND TREATMENT -- IN A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS. I JUST WANT TO SAY VERY QUICKLY -- FIRST OF ALL WE WORK THE STRATEGIC SEARCH WE'VE DONE HAS. OF EITHER I REALLY DETECTED A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT ON THEIR PART IN RECENT YEARS. TO WORK WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- ONE OF OUR MOST RECENT GRANTS WITH THE GROWTH COUNSEL FOR EXAMPLE INVOLVES WORKING FRESNO HELPING THAT CAN MAKE A DEAL -- DEVELOPER A RESILIENCE STRATEGY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- TO HELP LOWEST THE MOST JUST DISADVANTAGED MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS DEAL WITH EXTREME HEAT -- BUT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER TOOLS I WANTED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION ONE IS WHAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AS CAL SEAT AND CYCLOTRON ROAD. IS A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE CREATED THAT ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS TO TACKLE VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS -- IN THE MATERIAL SCIENCE AND OTHER HARD SCIENCE FIELDS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO DEVELOP A MEMBRANE THAT IS MUCH DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB OF SEPARATING. SALTS IN WATERS OF THE COMPUTER FIREWATER OR YOU WANT TO DEVELOP A NEW MATERIAL THAT WORKS AS A BETTER LITHIUM ION BATTERY OR SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND LITHIUM ION. THESE ARE HARD SCIENCE QUESTIONS AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE AND WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY DO IS DOES CALIFORNIA DEVELOP AND RESEARCH THESE BUT THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT MANUFACTURING THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT. HERE IN THE STATE I WOULD ALSO CALL OUT BIOSCIENCES -- THE CURRENT MODEL IN BIOSCIENCES TAKE A MICROBE YOU FEED IT SUGAR AND YOU GOT A CANCER CURE OR LIKE ABBAS DINNER HERCEPTIN OR YOU GET A NEW MATERIAL. THE HARD CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH OF A BY A RESOURCES ECONOMY SUMMIT WE CO HOSTED WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD A FEW WEEKS AGO. IS HOW DO YOU TAKE FOREST'S WASTE AGRICULTURAL WASTES AND BREAK THOSE DOWN TURN THOSE INTO FEED STOCKS THAT A MICROBE CAN DIGESTING GIVE YOU AT NEW CHEMICAL OR NEW PLASTIC OR SOMETHING IT REPLACES A PETROLEUM BASED. OPPORTUNITIES SO WE THINK THEY'RE MAJOR OPPORTUNITIES THERE. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO A HIGHLIGHT WE HAVE BETWEEN LAWRENCE LIVERMORE AND LAWRENCE BERKELEY WE HAVE TWO OF THE TOP TEN SUPERCOMPUTERS IN THE WORLD. WE LEAD AND SHOULD HAVE CALLED -- ADVANCED COMPUTING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE MANUFACTURING AND THE IDEA THERE IS TO ALLOW THE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO MAKE THEIR PROCESSES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND IF I AND AND COST EFFECTIVE. TO GIVE THEM SOME COMPUTER TIME TO RUN SIMULATIONS THAT ALLOW THEM TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE SO THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE THE TOOLS. WE LOVE WHAT WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND WE LOVE TO BE A RESOURCE THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT AT THIS TIME I JUST WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I HOPE YOU FOUND I THIS HEARING TO BE A SOLID STEP? IN DEVELOPING SOUND ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE JOB GROWTH I SUPPORT ENTREPRENEURS AND SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY I WANT. TO NOW THANK OUR PUBLIC -- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR SPEAKING IN TESTIMONY TODAY AND FOR OUR PANELISTS FOR JOINING US I WILL NOW ADJOURN THIS MEETING
