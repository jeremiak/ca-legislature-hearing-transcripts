THANK MONNING AYE ROTH ROTH I WILL HI WILK AYE ATKINS HI THAT COMES ON SO THAT PASSES FOUR ZERO WITH SENATOR BATES ABSENT. LET ME I'LL GO AHEAD AND INVITE UP. OUR GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO APPEAR DR BORAN STEEN MISS LESLEE AND MISTER OLSON IF YOU'LL COME ON UP AND- GET SITUATED. WELCOME I AS A COURTESY TO ONE OF OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES I'M GONNA INVITE. SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON UP SHE WANTS TO MAKE ONE INTRODUCTION AND I BELIEVE AND WILL IT TAKE YOU FIRST AND THEN MOVE INTO THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS VERY GOOD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I ACTUALLY SERVED ON RULES BEFORE SO THIS IS SORT OF AN INTERESTING VIEW. BUT I AM HERE AND VERY PLEASED TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND AND CONSTITUENT DAVID OLSON I HAVE KNOWN MISTER OLSON SINCE ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHEN HE BECAME THE C. E. O. OF PATAGONIA ONE OF THE GREAT A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES IN THIS NATION. HE MADE PATAGONIA THE FIRST UNITED STATES COMPANY TO GET ITS ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND ONE OF THE FIRST COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA TO TRACK AND COMMIT. TO REDUCING GHG GAS EMISSIONS THAT LED HIM A FEW YEARS LATER TO WORK WITH SENATOR BYRON SHARE TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ACTION REGISTRY THE FIRST STATE REGISTRY OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE NATION. I'D ALSO LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO ME BOTH IN MY DISTRICT AND I BELIEVE TO THE STATE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE PERSONALLY LED THE I SO BORED TO CHALLENGE INCLUSION OF THE POINTY GAS GENERATION PROJECT. IN THE I SO TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TRANSMISSION PLAN WHICH WOULD HAVE CLEARED THE WAY FOR THAT PROJECT TO BE BUILT INSTEAD HE DIRECTED I SO MANAGEMENT THE STUDY NON FOSSIL FUEL ALTERNATIVES THE I SO ANALYSIS SHOWED THE CLEAN RESOURCES WERE INDEED CAPABLE OF MEETING THE RELIABILITY NEED IN THE OXNARD CALIFORNIA AREA. AN AREA THAT HIS APPROXIMATELY HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT TO AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. AS A RESULT OF HIS EFFORTS TO S. C. ANY IS NOW PREPARING THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND AS NOTED IN THE LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM OXNARD. PRO TEM CARMEN RAMIREZ IT WAS DAVE'S VISION AND PERSISTENCE THAT HELP PROTECT THIS ECONOMICALLY DE A DISADVANTAGE COASTAL COMMUNITY AND HELP TO AVOID DECADES MORE OF ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THIS BECAME A TURNING POINT NOT SHOWS FOR OXNARD BUT FOR THE STATE. TO PROCURE CLEAN RESOURCES INSTEAD OF FOSSIL FUEL ONCE HE'S BEEN ALSO A VALUED RESOURCE TO ME ARE BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY IN MY INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE. AND I BELIEVE HE HAS CONSISTENTLY LED WITH EXPERTISE A STEADY HAND AND FORWARD THINKING POLICIES TO BENEFIT THE STATE AND THE PUBLIC HE HAS BEEN A LEADER IN OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE EFFORTS. AND I AM CONFIDENT HE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AND- HOPE THAT YOU WILL RECONFIRM HIM TO THIS POSITION HE IS A REAL TREASURE FOR US. AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO DO SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR INTRODUCTION OF THE CHAIRMAN FOR US IN YOUR SUPPORT WHICH WILL TAKE UP A LITTLE BIT LATER. SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND START AND I. AS TO MISTER OLSON WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN WILL START WITH YOU AND LET EACH OF YOU GIVE YOUR OPENING COMMENTS IT KNOWLEDGE ANYONE THAT CAME WITH YOU TO SUPPORT YOU IF YOU WANT AND THEN WE'LL GO RIGHT INTO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE RULES COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MADAM PROTON BUT BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE MY PARTNER OF FORTY FIVE YEARS DIANA DO AWAY. ON THE- IN ORDER THE AUTHOR AS WELL. SO MADAM PRO TEM. HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID WILSON. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERING MY REAPPOINTMENT TO US SERVE ON THE GOVERNORS OF THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE ASKED TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE HI AND THE GOVERNOR IN THIS ROLE. PERSONALLY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS TO MOVE BOTH OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY ON TO A MORE SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE FOOTING. A HEARING LIKE THIS IS TREMENDOUSLY ENCOURAGING IN THAT IT CAN FOCUS NOW ON CONCRETE STEPS TO MOVE TO A CLEAN ENERGY SYSTEM. WITH MY ACTIVE ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT. THE I SO HAS ADOPTED THE AMBITION TO BECOME THE FIRST GRADE OPERATOR IN THE WORLD. TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM THE FOSSIL BASED SYSTEM TO A NON CARBON ONE. WE ARE ALREADY RECOGNIZED OF WORLD WIDE AS A LEADER OF FOR THE FOR OUR WORKING INTEGRATING BOTH RENEWABLE ENERGY DEMAND RESOURCES AND STORAGE INTO OUR DAILY HOURLY AND MINUTE BY MINUTE OPERATIONS. IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN GRID OPERATORS FROM MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE COUNTRIES HAVE VISITED THE ISO TO LEARN FROM WHAT WE ARE DOING. OUR C. E. O. STEVE BURKE WAS RECENTLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FIFTEEN LARGEST GRID OPERATORS WORLDWIDE. PRECISELY BECAUSE OF OUR LEADERSHIP IN TRANSLATING POLICY DIRECTION INTO RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY. LOW CARBON GRADES HAVE PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND OPERATE IN PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT WAYS THAN FOSSEL BASED ONES. AS WE ELECTRIFY BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORTATION. POLICY DEVELOPMENT MUST ENSURE THAT THE EYES SO HAS THE RESOURCES AND THE PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO SUPPLY ELECTRICITY WITHOUT RELYING ON FOSSEL GENERATION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO DESCEND. HI TO ADVANCE THE GROUND BREAKING WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEGUN. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR BORN TODAY. THANK YOU I WON'T REPEAT EVERYTHING MISTER OLSON JUST SAID THOUGH I AGREE WITH ALL OF IT I AM VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE AND TO BE CONSIDERED FOR POTENTIAL POSITION ON THE I SO BORED I HAVE STUDIED THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS FROM GASOLINE TO ELECTRICITY INCLUDING THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY CRISIS. AND HAVE WATCH THOSE MARKETS EVOLVE AS WE HAVE TURNED TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES AND NOT WHAT IT IS I THINK A VERY EXCITING WAY. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN RICH IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES WERE MOVING VERY QUICKLY TO GREAT MUCH LOWER LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN OUR ELECTRICITY SYSTEM AND I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE CREATING A LOT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT IS SPREADING TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE ULTIMATELY CALIFORNIA IS ONLY 1% OF WORLD GREENHOUSE GASES AND SO THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO. REALLY SOLVE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS BY EXPORTING THAT KNOWLEDGE IN WAYS THAT PARTICULARLY THE DEVELOPING WORLD CAN USE AND TO IN ORDER TO ADOPT LOW GREENHOUSE GAS TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THEY NEED TO GROW BUT THEY NEED TO GROW ON A MUCH MORE LOW CARBON PATH THAN WE HAVE GROUND. SO I A HAVE WATCH THIS HAPPEN I HAVE STUDIED AT AND I HAVE ADVISED ON IT OCCASIONALLY BUT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING AS A BOARD MEMBER. I THINK THE CHI SO IS ONE OF IS PROBABLY THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND EXCITING PART OF THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. IN PART OUT OF NECESSITY THEY HAVE HAD TO. INNOVATE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM WORK WITH HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLES. THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB DAY AS MISTER OLSON SAID HAVE OUR CONSTANTLY VISITED BY OTHER COUNTRIES AND STATES TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DOING IT. AND I THINK BEING PART OF THAT IS A IS VERY EXCITING FOR ME. I ALSO THINK I BRING SOME EXPERTISE PARTICULARLY ON THE ENERGY MARKETS SIDE THAT CAN BE USEFUL AS WE CONTINUE TO RAMP UP RENEWABLES. AND I THINK THE NEXT TEN YEARS WILL BE A VERY EXCITING TIME TO BE PART OF THE ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS LESSON. THANK YOU AND I'M SURE YOUR ENTHUSIASM BOTH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE FOR THIS JOB GOOD AFTERNOON ON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE BEING HERE TODAY SEEKING YOUR SUPPORT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE MY FAMILY WHO UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT PHYSICALLY HERE TODAY HOWEVER ON. HOPEFULLY ARE LISTENING MY SON JACOB IS BACK IN BOSTON I JUST DROPPED HIM FOR HIS FIRST YEAR LAW SCHOOL AND MY SON MICHAEL IS AT U. S. C. FINISHING HIS SENIOR YEAR IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS MY HUSBAND WHO DID OFFER TO BE. WHAT IS A PROFESSOR AT USC THE SCHOOL YEAR HAS JUST BEGUN HE HAS A CHAIR IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AT USC AND ON I WANT TO THANK THE BUSINESS TEAM I RUN A ORGANIZATION LOS ANGELES CALLED THE LOS ANGELES BUSINESS COUNCIL AND IF THEY'RE LISTENING I WANT TO THANK THEM BECAUSE THEY SHARE MY PASSION FOR SUSTAINABILITY. AND ON HAVE BEEN A BIG PART OF SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT THIS YEAR I WAS HONORED TO BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN JANUARY TO THE I. SO BORED AND I SEE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY TO BE CONFIRMED FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS CURRENTLY SEVEN FROM PARALLEL UNIVERSES I HAVE COMMITTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE ISSUES I BEGAN MY CAREER HERE. ON AS WITH THE FORMER SPEAKER LITTLE MCCARTHY FORTUNATELY SOME OF YOU ACTUALLY REMEMBER LABEL CARTHY I RAN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION FOR THE CITY CALIFORNIA AND ON I EVEN THEN WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW REGULATION COULD CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK THAT A LOT WHILE SAFEGUARDING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES IN I THINK IS WHAT MAKES THE STATE'S SPECIAL. AS WHAT ARE WE APPROVING THAT WE CAN DO I HAVE ALSO SERVED IN STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON AND I HAVE BEEN ON THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS FOR MANY YEARS AND ON AS YOU KNOW THAT THAT HAS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING ONE OF THE LARGEST. MUNICIPAL UTILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AT AT AT THE. TIME ONE OF THE DIRTIEST SO I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF A TRANSITION FROM COLD TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT'S A TOUGH TRANSITION BUT IT'S SO WORTH WHILE ONE. I'M ALSO PART OF THEIR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING AND ALSO THE 100% RENEWABLE ON ADVISORY GROUP. I WAS ALSO PART OF OUR WITH THE DEPARTMENT ARE IN POWER IN THE LA B. C. WE HELP CREATE ONE OF THE LARGEST SOLAR ROOF TOP PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND ON WE HELP DO THE RESEARCH POLICY DESIGN AND- EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM SO I'VE I HAVE BUILT A PROGRAM ON THE GROUND. IN THE RENEWABLE WORLD I'M EXCITED TO SERVE ON THE CALIFORNIA I SO BORED. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT JOB AS WE TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON GRID I THINK OUR JOB IS TO MAINTAIN RELIABILITY WHILE TRANSITIONING. OF TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB CREATING. ALL ON I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE OUR GOALS AND THAT THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WILL REQUIRE FULL COOPERATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND I THINK WE HAVE A VERY IMPRESSIVE HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEAM OF THE EYES SO. AND WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I SENATOR RALPH WOULD YOU LIKE TO START US OFF. THANK YOU THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM WELL FIRST CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THREE OF YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO. SERVER CONTINUE TO SERVE US A VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION THAT YOU. PROVIDE FOR ALL OF US PARTICULAR THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT QUITE AS KNOWLEDGEABLE. IN THIS AREA IS I'M SURE YOU ARE. OF DURING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION AND PERHAPS IT'LL COME UP AGAIN FOR US WE SPENT SOME TIME. LISTENING TO CONVERSATION ABOUT pWONDERING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON REGIONALIZATION WHAT THE ADVANTAGES FOR THE STATE WOULD BE AND IN PARTICULAR WHAT THE POTENTIAL PITFALLS. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A WOULD BE SHOULD WE MOVE DOWN THIS ROAD HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION AND. TAKE OTHER ACTION THAT MAY GET US THERE FOR QUESTION. PROFESSOR I WILL START I DON'T I'M NOT TOO. CALIFORNIA IS MOVING TOWARD VERY HIGH LEVELS OF INTERMITTENT RENEWABLES AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THE GREAT BALANCE WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME FORM BUT SOME ABILITY TO SMOOTH THE SYSTEM THAT CAN BE STORAGE THAT CAN BE NATURAL GAS AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT CAN ALSO BE TRADE WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE WEST OF CAL AT THE WE HAVE BEEN TRADING WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE WEST FOR YEARS KID THE I SO IN FIVE YEARS AGO STARTED AN IMBALANCE MARKET WHICH IS SMALL STAFF. SOME TRADING IN THE VERY SHORT TERM MARKET THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL THE CONCERNS ABOUT DOWNSIDES PARTICULARLY ABOUT BOLSTERING COAL IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WEST OR LOSS OF CONTROL OF OUR SYSTEM DON'T SEEM TO BE REALLY BEARING OUT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED TO RIGHT NOW SAY WE'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY TO FULL REGIONALIZATION THE NEXT STEP WHICH DIET SO HAS BEGUN TO EXPLORE ALWAYS WITH WORKING GROUP'S WITH A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT ISN'T IT IT'S A DAY AHEAD MARKET THIS WOULD BE A MUCH BIGGER MARKET. THAN THE IMBALANCE MARKET I THINK THE SIGNS ARE GOOD THAT THAT WAY IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL PURSUE ONCE WE DO THAT WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO THEN EVALUATE THAT AND SEE HOW IT YOU SEE HOW THAT'S GOING SO I CS MOVING TOWARDS REGIONALIZATION BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY NEED TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO FULL REGIONALIZATION AT THIS POINT I THINK THAT WE WILL LEARN AS WE GO. ON UP I EXPECT THAT WE'LL LEARN MOSTLY POSITIVE THINGS BUT WE WILL HAVE TIME TO OBSERVE AND SEE IF SOME OF THESE CONCERNS ARE BORN OUT A SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T BEEN BUT I BELIEVE. IN FOLLOWING DATA AND SO WE'LL SEE LEARN MORE AS. WE GO. ANYONE ELSE EVEN IF I A. R. CAN ADD TO THAT AND TALK A LITTLE BIT. SO SOON HOUSE SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY REQUIRED THE I SO TO DO A SERIES OF STUDIES OF THE BENEFITS. OF REGIONALIZATION OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION INTEGRATING THE THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT BALANCING AREAS IN THE WEST. DAD STUDIES THOSE STUDIES WERE DONE BY INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS FOUND A VERY LARGE SAVINGS MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS. FROM BEING ABLE TO OPERATE REGIONALLY INSTEAD OF STATE BY STATE OF ONE OF THE BENEFITS IS THE. MANY POWER PLANTS IN OTHER STATES IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES COULD BE RETIRED IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE ALL RIGHT NOW HE EVERY BALANCING AREA HAS TO MAINTAIN RESERVES IN ITS OWN SO WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HAVE TO. BE OPERATING POWER PLANTS WHICH ARE NOT NEEDED TO MEET THE NEEDS THE LOAD EVERY DAY SO. ACTUALLY DOZENS OF THOSE PLANS COULD BE IMMEDIATELY RETIRED. THAT'S ONE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT ADEN BUT FOR CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO HAVE READY LOW COST ACCESS TO A MUCH LARGER POOL OF CLEAN RESOURCES. MRS THE FASTEST AND LEASE COST WAY TO MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS SCHOOLS THE DONE THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY. HE AIMS HERE. THE NEED FOR RESOURCE DIVERSITY I'D I REALLY THINK NEEDS TO BE EMPHASIZED SO RIGHT NOW MOST OF OUR LARGE SCALE SOLAR PROJECTS ARE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. WHEN WE HAVE MONSOONAL FLOWS WERE PERIODS OF STORMS WE LOSE AT THE EYES SO WE WE'VE LOST UP OUR OUR DAY TO DAY. SO WE HAVE NOW ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF LARGE SCALE SOLAR PROJECTS. WE HAVE ON SOME DAYS THIS YEAR AND AT THE END OF LAST YEAR WONDER WAS STORMY WEATHER WE WERE ONLY GETTING ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS INSTEAD OF TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. DAD ARE IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR US SO MUCH TODAY BECAUSE WE CAN ORDER GAS GENERATION TO WRAP UP TO MEET THAT NEED. BUT IF GAS IS GOING TO RUN LESS. AND WE RELY LESS AND LESS ON GAS GENERATION. THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO SOLAR RESOURCES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WEST WHICH HAVE DIFFERENT WEATHER PATTERNS. SO IF THIRDS STORMS IN CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO GET SOLAR FROM NEW MEXICO OR UTAH. OF OR THE EASTERN OREGON. HE IS GOING TO BECOME MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT. THE VERY SIMILAR STORY WITH WIND WITH ON SHORE WIND DURING PERIODS OF HIGH PRESSURE HEAT WAVES WHICH CONSIDER OVER THE STATE FOR A WEEK OR MORE AT A TIME. THERE IS NO WIND BECAUSE OF HIGH PRESSURE EVENTS. SO AGAIN THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR US NOW SO MUCH BECAUSE WE CAN TURN TO GAS GENERATION. BUT IF WE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB ONE HUNDRED WE ARE GOING TO HAVE LESS AND LESS ABILITY TO TURN THE GAS FIRED GENERATION SO THAT REALLY UNDERLINES THE NEED FOR US TO THINK REGIONALLY. THERE'S ONE OTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT BEARS MENTIONING. HERE ARE HAN. IN SB THREE FIFTY WHICH WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO. THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA WAS THE ONLY STATE TO HAVE A 50% RENEWABLE ENERGY GOAL. NOW THERE ARE SIX STATES THAT HAVE 1100% RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS AND A SEVENTH IDAHO THE STATE HAS MADE A COMMITMENT BUT THE UTILITY IDAHO POWER HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO. TURN TRANSITION TO A 100% OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SO THAT HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE BUT WHAT THAT MEANS ALSO IS THAT NOW WE HAVE MANY OTHER STATES THAT ARE THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING A WHOLE LOT MORE WIND AND SOLAR RESOURCES. SINCE WE ALL WANT TO MOVE TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHARE OUR RESOURCES AND THAT HE IS THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA BEHIND INTEGRATING ALL THESE REGIONAL BOUNCING AREAS TO MAKE IT EASY LOW COST WAY. TO SHARE YOUR WIND AND SOLAR RESOURCES HYDRO GEOTHERMAL ACROSS THE STATE MINES. IS LESLIE ANY FURTHER COMMENT. I WOULD JUST SAY ON THAT I THINK IT'S A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX IN THE THAT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT REALLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE CLIMATE GOALS WE SET THE GOAL OF 60% RENEWABLE ENERGY APPROACHING US IN TWENTY THIRTY WE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED 33% ON TO THE GRID. SO THE ISSUE IS HOW DO WE GO FROM THE THIRTY THREE TO THE SIXTY WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A PLAN IN MIND WHEN WE ADOPTED THOSE GOALS FOR NOW WORKING ON THE PLAN SO THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU SEE THE SERIES OF OPTIONS BEING PRESENTED BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO RULE ANYTHING OUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A GOAL YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE BUT TO THAT POINT. I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IT HAS A LOT OF CONTROL OVER AND THAT HELP MITIGATE THE BELLY OF THE DUCK TO MAKE THE NEXT YOU KNOW NOT IN A STRANGLED SITUATION AND THAT IS THAT LIKE TO ME AND RESPONSE TIME OF DAY YOU USE THESE ARE ALL WITHIN YOUR CONTROL. THE. THE ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT MITIGATE THE BILL IS THE DEATH. OF THESE ARE WITHIN YOUR CONTROL SO TO THAT. END I THINK THIS IS A COLLABORATION THERE WERE IN THIS IS A- THIS IS A- A SHARED GOAL OF GETTING TO THE 60% GOAL AND A 100% OVER TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO. I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER THOSE AS WELL. VERY VERY INFORMATIVE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AND OTHER RELATED ISSUES. CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR- NOMINATIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ARE CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR POLL REAPPOINTMENT AN APPOINTMENT. I REALLY APPRECIATED WHAT YOU SHARED ABOUT WE ONLY A MINUTE 1% OF ALL CARBON AND WHAT OUR ROLE IS. IN ADDITION TO REDUCING IS EXPLORING TECHNOLOGIES AND BEST PRACTICES SO EVERYBODY ELSE CAN JOIN IS SO APPRECIATED HEARING THAT. MY MAIN QUESTION WAS THE ONE I WAS ASKED WE SAT AROUND I COULD ASK YOU GUYS A QUESTION JUST AS YOUR QUESTION I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH ALL OF YOU YESTERDAY. THINK THESE ARE EXCELLENT SELECTIONS AT THE GOVERNOR MADE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SHARING THAT THIS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE OFFICE WORKING TOGETHER TO GET THERE SO WITH THAT CONGRATULATIONS I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I TO WANT TO ADD MY CONGRATULATIONS AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR APPRECIATION FOR YEAR STEPPING UP MISTER OLSON FOR YOUR CONTINUATION AND FOR THE TWO OF YOU STEPPING UP TO. HELP LEADERS IN THESE. ACHIEVING OUR TARGETS WHILE PROTECTING. CALIFORNIANS SIN. REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT I'LL START WITH THE QUESTION TO MISTER OLSON. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING OUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS IS YOU KNOW I REPRESENT PART OF MY DISTRICT TO SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY WHERE WE'RE DE COMMISSIONING. DIABLO CANYON WHICH CURRENTLY PRODUCES ABOUT ABOUT 5% OF THE STATE WIDE GRID. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS EXPLORATION WELL UNDER WAY FOR OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY MAY BE USING SOME OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST CURIOUS YOUR THOUGHTS ON. THE ROLE THAT OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY MIGHT PLAY THE OPPORTUNITIES THE OBSTACLES. THANK YOU SENATOR BIDEN I THINK OUR OFFSHORE WIND HE HAS A VERY LARGE AND IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN MEETING OUR CLEAN ENERGY NEEDS. IT'S A TREMENDOUS RESOURCE. IT IS VERY DIFFERENT VIDEO LOGICALLY DOWN THE ON SHORE WIND RESOURCE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. OF MUCH MORE POWERFUL WINDS THAT BLOW MANY MORE HOURS OF THE YEAR ARE GENERALLY NOT AFFECTED BY THE HIGH PRESSURE HEAT WAVE EVENTS THAT WE HAVE OVER LAND. ADEN SO IT'S A RELATIVELY CLOSE BY AND AS YOU POINT OUT BECAUSE IT IS CAPABLE OF UTILIZING DE INTERCONNECTION INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE SUBSTATIONS AND THE TRANSMISSION LINES THAT DYEABLE CANYON POWER PLANT HAS USE. SO THERE'S A POTENTIAL TO GREATLY REDUCE THE COST OF OFFSHORE WIND BY UTILIZING THAT ALREADY BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CLINTON THERE'S THERE WOULD BE I THINK OF VERY STRONG CASE FOR USING OUR BEST EFFORTS AS A STATE TO HAVE THIS RESOURCE. DEVELOPED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE ARE ON THE OBSTACLES RIGHT NOW CAR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE THAT OFFSHORE WIND TOWERS COULD POSE TO THEIR OPERATIONS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. ON THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN NEGOTIATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SO OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION DAVID HAWKSHAW OLD AND COMMISSIONER KAREN DOUGLAS AVENUE LEADING DETAILED DISCUSSIONS. AND I THINK THEY'RE APPROACHING THIS IN A VERY PROACTIVE WAY YEAH AND. HI I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL OF THE GET SOME AGREEMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE THAT WILL ALLOW. SOME DEVELOPMENT IN SOME OFF SHORE AREAS WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES YET. SO THAT'S THE FIRST UP THE SECOND STEP IS THEN THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT WILL HAVE TO ISSUE LEASES. AND THEN THERE CAN BE COMPETITIVE BIDDING OF BY THE WIND COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP THOSE LEASES WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT THE I. S. O. WOULD THEN GET INVOLVED OF BECAUSE THOSE OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS WILL NEED TO CONNECT TO THE CALIFORNIA GRIT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HELP FACILITATE AT THAT POINT. WE HAVE ALREADY DONE SOME PRELIMINARY STUDIES THAT WOULD LOOK AT POTENTIAL FOWS OF POWER FROM OFFSHORE WIND USING THE DIAL BELOW CANYON INFRASTRUCTURE. OF WE WILL DO MORE DETAILS STUDIES AS THIS PROGRESSES BUT I THINK FROM ALL IN ALL RESOURCE POINT OF VIEW. THIS IS A VERY VERY POSITIVE AND PROMISING RESOURCE FOR US WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- I WAS ENCOURAGED WHEN WE SPOKE YESTERDAY BY YEAR. WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM I KNOW IT SHARED BY. MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS WE'VE BEEN IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH KAREN DOUGLAS AND MR HAVE CHILD. END I KNOW THERE. ME INVOLVED IN THIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH DEPARTMENT OFFENSE YOU ALSO CITED ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS. MARINE MARINE LIFE CONSIDERATIONS BUT WE'RE NOT THE FIRST TO EMBARK ON THIS IN IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC THERE'S WIND ENERGY THAT'S I THINK SERVING NORTHERN EUROPE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN VERY LARGE AMOUNT. YES SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN IN ALL OF THE BOARD AS AS THIS PART OF OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY FORWARD. ENERGY FUTURE MIGHT MOVE FORWARD IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL MOVE TO DR. BORENSTEIN WITH A WITH A DIFFERENT QUESTION WE SPOKE SOME YESTERDAY ABOUT THE- COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION THE CCA'S THAT ARE SETTING UP REGIONAL BUYING GROUPS FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION I'M JUST CURIOUS YOUR THOUGHTS ON. HOW HOW DO THEY FIT IN TO OUR ENERGY FUTURE AND THE ROLE OF THE BIG ENERGY PRODUCERS VERSUS THESE MORE COMMUNITY BASED TO REGIONAL BASED. AT LEAST IN BUYING UNITS YEAH I THINK THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT CCA'S DO THEY ARE. IN SOME WAYS A LATTER DAY VERSION OF RETAIL CHOICE WHICH WE HAD BACK IN THE NINETIES AND RESTRUCTURING I DON'T WANT TO TAR IT IN ANY WAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY CRISIS. WHICH WAS NOT CAUSED BY THAT BUT BUT I THINK IT IS. AN ALTERNATIVE THAT PEOPLE ARE OFFERED FOR HOW THEY CAN CONTRACT FOR THEIR ELECTRICITY. NOT THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING ANYTHING PHYSICALLY TO CARRY ELECTRICITY OR GENERATE ELECTRICITY THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT A CITY CAN SAY WILL BE OUR PRIMARY OR DEFAULT. ELECTRICITY PROVIDER. AS SUCH I THINK IT WOULD THEY OFFERED EXCITING ALTERNATIVES. THEY HAVE GIVEN CITIES THE POSSIBILITY OF. DECIDING TO BUY HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLES. AND DIETING TO BUY MORE LOCAL ENERGY GENERATION IF THEY WANT TO. THERE ARE ALWAYS CONCERNS WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS DOING WITH OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES AND SO WHEN WE HAVE CCA'S OR RETAIL CHOICE. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE CLEAR WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS FOR INSTANCE TO ACQUIRE RESERVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CUSTOMERS ARE WELL INFORMED ABOUT THEIR ALTERNATIVES AND SO FORTH. I THINK AND HOW COSTS ARE GONNA BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE VARIOUS RETAIL PROVIDERS I THINK WE HAD SOME BUMPING THIS AT THE BEGINNING AROUND THOSE ISSUES DATES GETTING SORTED OUT. MY VIEW AND I HAVE WORKED WITH A COUPLE OF THE CCA'S TO THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVE RETAIL RATE STRUCTURES. THAT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPLEMENTING IN WAYS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE FAST AND EXPERIMENTAL THEN YOU'D THEN THE BIG UTILITIES COULD DO GOING TO THE CPSC. SO IN THAT WAY I THINK BACK TO THE IDEA OF KNOWLEDGE CREATION OF HAVING THE SORT OF BASTIONS OF EXPERIMENTATION WHERE THEY CAN TRY NEW THINGS WHETHER IT'S VERY HIGH RENEWABLES. DIFFERENT RETAIL RATE STRUCTURE FOR GIVES US MORE POSSIBILITIES AND I THINK HAVE AND I THINK THE CONCERNS THAT WERE THERE AT THE BEGINNING ARE GRADUALLY BEING WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF. ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE UTILITIES AND THESE RETAIL PROVIDERS BECAUSE THE UTILITIES. ARE STILL IN THE POWER PROVIDING STRIP. AT WORK AND SO FORTH SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT WHICH ORGANIZATION HAS EACH RESPONSIBILITY THANK YOU IN IN JUST A TALE ON TO THAT. SO THE CCA'S AS YOU INDICATED THEY'RE NOT PRODUCING THE ENERGY THEY'RE NOT CREATING IT THEIR MARKETING AND MOVE BUT THEY'RE RELYING ON THE BIG UTILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE TO MOVE IT. CAN THE BIG UTILITIES. SURVIVE PROVIDING ONLY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IF THEY'RE NOT. AT THE SAME TIME MARKETING THE ENERGY IF I'M FRAMING THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY I A I THINK THAT THAT IT THERE IS CLEARLY THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING UTILITIES THAT OUR WIRES COMPANIES. AND THAT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD GO BUT THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF THAT AROUND THE WORLD AND IN A IN WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT IS ONE POSSIBLE MODEL AND SO I THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WILL REMAIN ON THE TABLE IS A POSSIBILITY. AND CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT JUST AS WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE COMMUNITY RETAILING CCA'S AND PROBLEMS AND WE STILL HAVE CUSTOMERS WHO WERE ON DIRECT ACCESS OR RETAIL CHOICE THROUGH PRIVATE COMPANIES AND I THINK THAT. WE COULD END UP WITH THE MODEL AND IT'S A PERFECTLY WORKABLE MODEL WHERE THE WIRES COMPANY THE DISTRIBUTION COMPANY DOES DOESN'T PROCURE ELECTRICITY FOR ANYBODY THEY JUST MAKE THEIR MONEY ON THE WIRE SIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN LAST BUT NOT LEAST MISS LESLIE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY TOO AND I JUST WANT TO SAY. YOU BRING SUCH A VAST EXPERIENCE FROM STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT IN YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH. WHEN OF WATER AND POWER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SINCE YOU COME. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM THE POLITICAL WORLD THEN YOUR COLLEAGUES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT REGIONALIZATION. IT SEEMS LIKE FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW THERE ARE GREAT SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCIES TO BE GAINED I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERN WITHIN OUR LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER IN GOVERNANCE IF CALIFORNIA BECOMES PART OF A LARGER REGIONAL SYSTEM ANY THOUGHTS ON. COMMITTING GOVERNANCE QUESTION OF HOW CALIFORNIA DOESN'T OF SACRIFICE ITS ITS ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR OWN ENERGY FUTURE. I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE FEAR ON. MAINLY BECAUSE LOOK AT THE VALUE OF THE ICE THE ICE IS BEEN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW I DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE IT UNTIL I GOT I WAS PART OF THIS PROCESS TO SELF CRITICAL THE ICE WHO IS ON AYE WE DEALT QUITE A BIT WITH FOR THE DEPARTMENT MODERN POWER BECAUSE OF COURSE WERE REGULATED BY THE AND THEN WE'RE PERMITTED BY THEM SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEM. I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT WE NEED AS THIS OF ALL RIGHT I THINK THE E. I AM THIS ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET EVEN FROM THE DWP PERSPECTIVE IS A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY THE DELIVERY PEOPLE AND THAT I THINK IN TWO YEARS. I THINK WITH THE BOARD CREATED WHAT WOULD SPLIT DAVE AND OTHERS CREATED IS REALLY GOING TO HELL CALIFORNIA HOW BROADER RELATIONSHIPS AND BRING OTHER ENERGY AND OTHER BALANCING AUTHORITIES INTO ONE SYSTEM AND THAT WILL HELP US GET TO THE STATE GOALS BECAUSE THERE IS SILOS EVEN WITH IN CALIFORNIA THE E. I AM THIS IS SOLVING THAT IS PART OF SOLVING THAT SO I THINK AS- DOCTOR BORN SEEN SAID THIS IS AN ERROR TO PROCESS RIGHT LET'S SEE HOW THE I AM BECAUSE WE HAVE EIGHT NINE MEMBERS NOW. WE'RE GONNA PICK UP EIGHT OR NINE MORE IN TWO YEARS WE'LL HAVE WE'LL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD FEEL FOR A BROAD BASED GROUP THIS IS THE REAL TIME MARKET WE'RE TRADING IN 5% THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT EVOLVING INTO THE EDM WHICH IS THE ON THE DAY AHEAD MARKET THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D BE LOOKING. AT A 100% MARKET OF ENERGY TRADING. YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT I DON'T WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE RESPONSE WILL BE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO THAT BUT WE THINK IT COULD BE POSITIVE. ON WILL HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE TO US. RIGHT WING WILL KNOW YOU KNOW IF WE SAVE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TODAY. AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION OF THAT HAS BEEN TO CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW YOU CAN JUST THINKING AHEAD BECAUSE ONE THING WE DON'T KNOW IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST OF A 100% RENEWABLE. IT LOOKS LIKE YEAH RIGHT RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AGAIN YEAR. DISPLAY OF KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE- WE'RE BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ALREADY. AND I THINK IN POLITICS OFTEN IT'S BUILDING THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO TAKE THAT LEAP. FORWARD TO INTERESTING. BROADER RESPONSIBILITY TO A BROADER GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO. WHO IN THE END SHARE COMMON OBJECTIVES BUT. I'M SURE I WANNA YOU'VE BEEN INDULGING LETTER IT THIS IS R. ENERGY FUTURES SO CRITICAL. IN THE POSITIONS THAT YOU ARE BEING. APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO FULFILL THERE'S SO MUCH MORE WE CAN TALK ABOUT. OUR ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND MODELING. AS WAS INDICATED IN THE OPENING STATEMENT SO AGAIN MY THANKS ALL OF YOU IN AND CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SURE. I THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK THIS IS. STRUCTURE TO UNDERSTAND SO I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES BRING UP THE ISSUE OF. REGIONALIZATION AND GOVERNANCE THAT SEEMS TO BE WERE WE GET STUCK WHILE YOU'RE BUSY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AN EVEN BIGGER MORE COMPLEX. OVERALL HOW WE FIT INTO THIS AND WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE IN WATER THE EFFICIENCIES OF SCALE BY BROADENING. BUT IT AND IN THIS MAY BE A SIMPLE QUESTION I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO MISTER OLSON YESTERDAY I DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY WITH YOU SO TO THIS TO YOU. I WOULD ASK YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S ABILITY WE ALREADY HAVE AUTHORIZATION UNDER LAW TO DO BILATERAL TRANSACTIONS TO BUY AND SELL RENEWABLES. HI SO REGIONALIZATION IS BIGGER THAN THAT GOVERNANCE IS BIGGER THAN THAT BUT IF WE ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO MUCH OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHY THE PUSH FOR REGIONALIZATION FROM AYE AYE IS SO I IN THE PAST YOU HAVE A PREVIOUS GOVERNOR WHO SUPPORTED REGIONALIZATION YOU HAVE A CURRENT GOVERNOR WHO IS DUBIOUS OF IT AT LEAST AT ONE POINT WHEN HE AND I SPOKE. BEFORE HE WAS SWORN IN SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO MISTER OLSEN I'D BE APPRECIATIVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT EVEN IF I YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY COVERED A LOT OF IT BUT I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF WE CAN CURRENTLY DO I WHAT IT IS THE INTENT. WHY PUSH. FIRST GIVE UP OUR THIRTY. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS THE IMBALANCE MARKET WHICH IS ONLY 5% IS MISS LESLEE SAID WHAT WERE MOVING TOWARDS IS THE DAY HAD MARKET WHICH IS WHERE ESSENTIALLY THE REST OF THE POWER ULTIMATELY IS TRANSACTED OKAY BUT THE BUT THE DISTINCTION LET ME AND I'M SORRY LET ME I'M TRYING TO FOLLOW. THAT'S THE DISTINCTION NO NO THAT'S THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE IMBALANCE MARKET IN THE DAY I HAD BOTH OF THOSE CAN BE DONE WITHOUT A REGIONAL SYSTEM OPERATOR WHAT CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT A REGIONAL SYSTEM OPERATOR IS TRANSMISSION PLANNING INTEGRATED TRANSMISSION PLANNING SO IF YOU REALLY GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS DISPATCHED EFFICIENTLY YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PLAN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH TRANSMISSION CAPACITY. TO MOVE THE SOLAR POWER IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON WHEN THE SUN IS SETTING IN NEW MEXICO INTO CALIFORNIA ARE THE OTHER WAY AROUND FROM CALIFORNIA TO MEXICO AND IN THE MORNING WHEN THE SUN IS COMING UP IN NEW MEXICO INTO CALIFORNIA SO HAVING THAT SORT OF TRANSMISSION PLANNING ALLOWS US TO NOT JUST DISPATCHED DAY TO DAY MORE EFFICIENTLY BUT TO ACTUALLY BUILD AN ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT'S INTEGRATED THAT ALLOWS US TO. LOWER THE COST OF INTEGRATING THESE INTERMITTENT RENEWABLES SO I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT FROM THE DAY HAD MARKET I THINK WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR FROM JUST THE IMBALANCE MARKET IS A VERY TINY PIECE BUT ULTIMATELY IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE AN EFFICIENT OPERATION WHERE WE USE A VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL OF INTERMITTENT RESOURCES THERE ARE GOING TO BE BIG ADVANTAGES TO REGIONALIZATION. NOW THERE ARE POTENTIAL CONCERNS TO AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY MONITORING THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BENEFITS ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY CONCERNS. AND YOUR CONCERNS WOULD BE WELL ONE OF THE CONCERNS HAS. AND THAT THIS IS GOING TO KEEP COAL PLANTS OPERATING LONGER AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE SO FAR DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND THERE ARE LEGAL CONCERNS ALTHOUGH I WILL CONFESS I AM NOT AN EXPERT AT THAT. THANK YOU AND MISTER OLSON SHARED THAT. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD I WAS GONNA SAY I DON'T THINK REGIONALIZATION UNTO ITSELF IS THE GOAL YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S WHAT I SAID BEFORE I THINK IT'S A TOOL YOU KNOW I THINK THE- I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR MAKES SENSE WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INCORPORATE 33% RENEWABLES ONTO THE GRID. SO FAR. I THINK IT WAS WISE TO PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL WAYS TO APPROACH THIS WITH THE I AM I THINK THE I AM GOING TO PROVE VERY BENEFICIAL. AS SEVEN JUST SAID YOU YOU CAN ADD THE EDM WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE ON. THE STRUCTURE OR THE AUTHORITY OF THE KING OF THE CALIFORNIA ON THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE I DON'T REALLY THINK WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AT THIS POINT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER DOING A DEMAND RESPONSE. YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS WITHIN OUR CONTROL BECAUSE WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AT ALL WE'RE TRYING TO MITIGATE. THE PEAK THE PEAK ON A TIMES ON THE ON THE GRID WE WANT TO MAINTAIN GRID RELIABILITY THE THING THAT THREATENS GRID RELIABILITY IS THAT STEEP RAMP THIS HAPPENING BETWEEN. FIVE AND NINE SO THAT'S. WHAT THAT'S THE CONCERN YOU'RE HEARING HERE IS ABOUT THAT RIA. IF I CAN JUST ADD ONE OTHER THING. THE BOTH THE I AM AND DAY HAD ENERGY DEAD MARKET THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE VOLUNTARY AND THE REST OF THE WEST AND- THERE ARE ENTITIES THAT ARE ABLE TO SORT OF STEP IN AND STEP OUT. DAY BY DAY. ON RTO IS ON ALL IN SO IT REALLY IS PLANNING JOINT BECAUSE WE'RE DURING TRANSMISSION PLANNING JOINTLY. AND WE ARE DISPATCHING THE SYSTEM. SO I THINK. ULTIMATELY TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS. HAVING A SYSTEM WHERE WE DO HAVE COMMITMENT BY ALL THE PLAYERS WOULD BE MORE VALUABLE THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH MORE VALUABLE. THANK YOU. I AM SORRY IF I MADE YOU REPEAT YOURSELF A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS BUT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE HAD AND- YOU SEEM TO BE ALIGNED IN. OUR CHALLENGES ARE OPPORTUNITIES AND KIND OF AN APPROACH.
