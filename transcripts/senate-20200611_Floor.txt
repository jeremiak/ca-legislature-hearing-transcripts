LANDLORDS OF SUBSTANCE TO DIS MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TO OFFER YOUR TENANTS THE OPTION OF HAVING THEIR RENT PAYMENTS REPORTED TO A MAJOR CREDIT PEARL. BY FOCUS. SUBSIDIZE IN THE BILL ALERT TO THOSE TENANTS LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT STEP. OR IN THEIR CREDIT SCORE. WE ALL KNOW THE FACTS OF A NEGATIVE CREDIT SCORE AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT IT HAS ON PEOPLE WHO FAIL TO PAY RENT OR ANY OTHER BILL TIME THERE'S NO REASON WHY WARNER RAPPERS. WHO REGULARLY A- THEIR RENT SHOULD RECEIVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THEIR CREDIT SCORE FOR DOING SO PARTICULARLY NOW DO THE COLBERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS ARE SUFFERING ECONOMICALLY. THIS BILL COULD HELP YOU SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE STRUGGLING CALIFORNIA'S BY GIVING THEM A WAY TO IMPROVE THEIR CARE CREDIT SCORE. ON AN PROSPERITY NOW AND IS SUPPORTED BY SERVICE. THE GROUPS INCLUDING WESTERN CENTER WITH LONG PARK PROPERTY- WE HAVE NOT. REACHED CONSENSUS WITH THE ROTORS FOR- PARDON SO SHUSHAN BUT WE'RE CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING AS WE SPEAK AND- HI INCOME COMMITTEE. MOVING THIS FORWARD IF IT GETS OFF THE FLOOR TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. HERTZBERG. MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL. ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THEY WERE FACING WITH RESPECT TO THE ON BANKS AND UNDER BANKED. TRYING TO GET THEM INTO THE SYSTEM THAT IS COMPLETELY DESIGNED ABOUT CREDIT CARDS AND LOANS WITH RESPECT CREDIT RATING. WE HAVE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO GETTING PEOPLE CREDIT AND HERE PEOPLE EVERY OTHER TO THEIR UTILITY BILL OR PAYING THE RIGHT EDGE. SHOULD BE IN THE TOP WHETHER THERE WERE THE. THIS IS A DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A BIG BILL BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM WE HAVE THE DISADVANTAGES PEOPLE. IN THE WAY THE JUSTICE ON FAIR THIS UNBANKED AND UNDER BANKED PROBLEM IS HUGE IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOU TALK TO YOU SEE THAT REMAIN BANK HE START IN INDIA AND AFRICA. WOMEN THE SMALL BONES THEY BASICALLY SOCIAL COMMITTEE IS ENOUGH. TO PAY STUFF BACK IN THEY DON'T HAVE THE TRADITIONAL KINDS OF IN DISH TO IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE SO MANY. WE DID HER WEATHER. CREDIT FOR THE AND THE SYSTEM IS STAFF BUT- THE UNBANKED AND UNDER BANKED THIS IS A HUGE PIECE IT DOESN'T GET BUT I. WITH THIS MEASURE. STEP AGAINST THE KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL BIAS THE COURAGE TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE WITH CREDIT CARDS AND ALL THE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE ON LEAVE IMPORTANT. INVALUABLE AND TO BE CHARGED THE KIND OF INTEREST RATES FOR THE NIGHT LOANS THAT HAPPENED THESE THINGS THEIR CREDIT IS NOT PROPERLY BEACON I STAND STRONG SUPPORTER THIS MAY. SENATOR YES. NUMBER CAN I SPEAK WITH THIS OFF WORD. I BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO KEEP THE MONEY FEDERAL. OKAY AND YOUR- ALLOWED INTO IT IT WE HEAR IT BETTER OUR THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENTION HERE AND I THINK DURING A JUDICIARY APPEARED REMOTELY. SOME QUESTIONS AND I THINK IT KIND OF GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT CREDIT IS. OUR CREDIT SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES IS PREMISED ON PERSONAL RELIABILITY. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD HERE IS THAT WE ARE INCORPORATING INTO THE CALCULUS OF PERSONAL RELIABILITY BASED ON PAST PERFORMANCE IN OTHER EXTERNALITIES. ON WHAT. IN THIS I HAVE SOME MERIT THAT THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE IN NEED TO. WHERE THE NECESSARY CREDIT FOR UPWARD MOBILITY. THE CONCERN WITH THIS IS THAT WE COULD BE ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING THE CREDIT PROCESS ON FAIRLY WHAT I MEAN BY UNFAIRLY IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SEGMENT OF THE VISUALS FOR HAVING THEIR RENT CHECK. FOR BY WHETHER YOU NEED TO EAD ANY THERE SO SERVICE. WHAT DO NOT MISS ALL OF OUR ACTION EIGHT WERE MORE ONLY BECAUSE OF THEY'RE NOT THIS- ON ALL TO NEEDS TO HAVE DISCRETIONARY RENT CHECKS I CAN'T. PROCESS DONE THE AUTHORS PUT IN THIS PLEDGES. SO I WOULD THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE MADE MUCH MORE. COMPREHENSIVE AND MORE FLEXIBLE IF THIS WERE APPLIED TO ALL RENTERS THAT SHOULD A RENTER WHETHER THEY'RE SECTION EIGHT- FOR WHETHER THE HE THE- RENT. BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THE LANDLORD IN. LORD ALL BOARDS THE REPORTING IT. I THAT WOULD BE A EQUITABLE TO LOOK AFTER BOTH THE INTEREST THOSE WHO KNEW IT IS MOBILITY. WORDS WHO ARE THE THIRD ONE ENOUGH. MORE PAY THEIR BILLS TIME SO I THE UNDER THIS CURRENT FOR IT'S A BETTER I UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE BUT IT IT LITERALLY. DOES NOT KING POOR IN THERE THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT OF THE RENTAL RENTAL POPULATION HELLO FOR. SENATOR BREAUX. SHARE THAT BETTER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE DO PAY THE RENT ON TIME THAT IT. VALIDATE THEIR- BUT I ALSO HOLE HOT. PERCENT AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO THAT THIS BILL ONLY LIMITS TO THOSE THAT HAVE GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO PAY THEIR RENT AND NOT THE WORKING POOR OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. APRIL STORE SCORE. TV BUYING THEIR OWN. IF WE CAN I WOULD PULL HER SUPPORTED THAT WOULD ALLOW ALL INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT OUT OF THIS CODE CRISIS AND SAYS BASICALLY WERE ALL. ALL OF. WE'LL TELL YOU FOR ALL THE WAY FOR THAT GO OUT WORK EVERY DAY AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES ON MY INCOME PEOPLE TO USE THAT. TO A STAFF CREDIT SCORE AS WELL AS A HIGHER CREDIT- TO SEE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS ON TIME AND SO I WHOLE HEARTEDLY MY COLLEAGUES PRESS I DO THINK A- TO A LOT HELLO AND TO ABLE TO. HELP THERE WERE THEY PAID. HIS SO THAT. ALSO ARM SO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WITH THE WORKING POOR IN ANY AND ALL MEANS SOME PEOPLE'S RIGHT CAN BE A VERY HIGH INSTANTLY. INSTILL BE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE STREET TO PURCHASE A HOME. AND SO. ALL CAL. TO CURRENT RENT PAYMENTS AND THE PAYMENTS BEING MADE ON TIME AND SO LIKE I SAID I APPLAUD THE BILL IN THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND BILL I JUST THINK IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR CAL. IS FOR ALL ALL. LIKE I MIGHT. SENATOR RICK OWSKI. MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE SINCE OF THIS BILL YOU KNOW I'VE HAD THE MANY PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE COLOR DEBT THE CHECK WE HAVE FOR THIS CALL. WHEN IT.

APARTMENT IT'S REALLY JUST FOR PERSON RIGHT NOW GET ALL THE- SO. BUT IS WE WERE BE NICE KNOW WE GET ASK QUESTION. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE PENALTY. FOR DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND OF COURSE I MAY HAVE A DIFFICULTY FINDING ACTUAL CASES OF VOTER FRAUD BUT WE CERTAINLY STORIES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. INCLUDING SENATOR LUGAR. AT FOUND JUST A LOT OF IT. OF THESE TYPES OF. CONCERNS WITH WE GETTING TICKET. AND THAT THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY DO WE. SEVENTEEN AFTER ELECTION DAY. WELL THE I THINK THE QUESTION IN A MORE LIKE GOES TO HOW LONG THE REGS HEY TO BE TALLY THE THAT COME IN IF YOU'RE A BALLOT CLOSE BY DAY THEN THE REGISTRAR CAN COUNT THAT BALLOT FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION AND THE REASON IS A IS STOP. I ARE CLOSE OFFICE IS USE. QUITE A FISH ON OCCASION THEY'RE NOT A AS WE'D LIKE THEM TO BE AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO DISENFRANCHISE AND WON- NOT THROUGH ANY FAULT OF THEIR OWN BUT BECAUSE THE POST OFFICE. MAYES LIVER. WELL THAT'S THE- SURE THAT. ARE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE BALLOT MUST BE POSTMARKED BY ELECTION DAY. THANK YOU THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION IS THE THIRD QUESTION. HOW DO WE JUSTIFY AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN THE GENERAL FUND NOW THAT WE ARE IN A- RECESSION. WILL BE HOPING THE NEXT. A FEW DAYS ON A BY. PERHAPS SOME SO CUTS OF. THE YOU KNOW HOW WHAT ARE THE COSTS BENEFIT CAN HER COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT. SO OF THE A GOOD QUESTION IN IN OUR BUDGET IS A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES AND WHAT WE PRIORITIZE- THE ELECTION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO PRESERVATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND IN FRANCHISING AS MANY AS POPS. WELL IS INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I BELIEVE THAT THE MARGINAL JUST CHECKED ON THE CITY THE MARGINAL COST IS ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT THIS BILL WOULD ADD EPISODE YES THE THERE IS A- TEMA DOLLARS. BUT WE'RE A VERY POOL BAR BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE TEAM MAY DOLLARS IN SCHOOLS. THANK YOU ITEM PER TO WITH SOME FOR. CURRENTLY CAL. IS THE STAY. IN THE NATION HAS. ISSUED ITS JUNE THIRD. TWENTY NINETEEN. AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FOR MOST LARGE MUNICIPALITIES SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN SIX MONTHS FROM DECEMBER- CALIFORNIA HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN DONE AROUND APRIL- WE CONTACT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND WE WERE TOLD IT PROBABLY WON'T BE UNTIL SEPTEMBER SO. DARK DEAL THAT OF ALL THE STATES WERE NOT. SHOWING PEOPLE ARE FINANCIAL STATE. AS FAR A LITTLE CONCERNED SO WE CALL THE- STATE CONTROLLERS OFFICE IN THEY SAID THAT THERE WERE TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE HOLDING UP. THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. ONE OF THEM BEING THE SECRETARY OF STATE. SO COLLEAGUES ARE JUST KIND OF CONCERNED OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S DEPARTMENT IT IT HAS A PERCEPTION OF BEATING **** TIME JUST KIND OF STERN WE CERTAINLY NOT THE MUSE HAPPEN WITH MOTOR VOTER BEING IMPLEMENTED WILL TOO SOON. WHAT THE SOFTWARE NOT AVAILABLE AND CREATED QUITE A MESS. I REALLY WANT TO PORT A. EIGHT SIXTY BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT ABUSE. ABOUT A COSTS IN I'M NERVOUS OF THE SECOND OF STATE'S. THAT APPEARS TO BE. STRUGGLING OR WHATEVER FLOUNDERING WHATEVER'S HAPPENING OVER THERE OF THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND AND I ARE WHAT I. WANT I WANT TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING THAT I. DIRECTLY SUPPORTED BUT I'M I JUST RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF- THE ONE DEPARTMENT AND HOW REFLECTS ON THE REST OF THE STATE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATOR HERTZBERG. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS. WE DO IN OUR DEMOCRACY THAT INFORMS OUR DEMOCRACY. THE ALLOW PEOPLE. PARTICIPATION DEVOTE THAT DEFINES THE ESSENCE OF OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE A VOICE. WE HAVE DECADES IN THIS INSTITUTION. DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO GIVE ALL PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT VOICE. WE FOUND IN DURING THE BUSH VERSUS GORE CASE THAT THEY WERE CALIFORNIA THE HANGING CHAD PROBLEMS. THE VOTERS AUTHORIZED TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BOND ISSUE TO FIX THAT. WE TALKED TO FOLKS THAT- OFTEN A RENTERS IN. REVENUE PLACE AND FIND OUT THAT THE THIRTY DAY LIMITATION ON. REGISTRATION INHIBITED A WHOLE HOST OF PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE MOVED TO FIFTEEN DAYS AND THEN KIND OF A PARTIAL SAME DAY REGISTRATION. A FEW YEARS AGO. LOOK AT THIS IDEA VOTE CENTERS. FOLKS WORK ACROSS TOWN CAN'T GET BACK HOME BECAUSE THEY GOT PROBLEMS OF THEIR KIDS OR THIS OR SICK OR WORK OR SOMETHING AND THEY MISS VOTING. SO WE SET UP VOTE CENTERS WITH ELIMINATE THE TRADITIONAL VOTING PLACES WOULD REDUCE THE FEW BECAUSE OF COSTS BUT THE REALITY IS. HE WANTED TO VOTE YOUR COMMITTEE YOU COULD. SOME HAVE GONE TO ALMOST ALL VOTE BY. IT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE I DIDN'T DO TO BUILD THIS FEEL THE WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE INSTEAD WE CHOSE TO PURSUE THE ISSUE CENTERS SOME COUNTIES FELT THIS WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE. BUT SIR OF THE PANDEMIC CHAO. WITH THE LARGER DYNAMIC IS WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYBODY ON EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE TO PARTICIPATE AND SO THIS IS JUST ONE IT DOESN'T ELIMINATE PEOPLE VOTING THEIR COMMITTEE THE PRECINCTS IT DOESN'T A LOT BUT I PEOPLE VOTING OTHER VOTE CENTERS OF FAT STATE WHAT CHOOSE TO DO. IT DOES IN THE ELIMINATE. THREE LATE BECAUSE- THEY WORK ON THE LA WHAT IT IS. I JUST STOPPED A MOMENT BECAUSE THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT IS IMPORTANT ISSUE BACKED UP BY ELECTIONS CODE SECTION EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AT SAC. THAT PROVIDES FOR IN VARIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE UP TO THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINES. FOR COMMITTING FRAUD IN THE ELECTION PROCESS AND THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF WAYS THAT'S DONE. SO THERE IS A VERY DEEP SET OF TEETH BEHIND PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN VOTER FRAUD BUT YOU MARRY THAT AGAINST THE ESSENCE OF WHO WE ARE AS A DEMOCRACY AND WE SHOULD PASS THIS BILL. WITH GREAT ENERGY YOUR EYES ON. SENATOR DR OF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NO I SPEND MOST OF MY- MOVING ORGANIZING AND MOBILIZING PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO SPEAK UP. AND ONE WAY WAS TO REGISTER TO VOTE ANOTHER WAY WAS TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT OUT TO VOTE IN FACT IN ONE CAMPAIGN WE USE THE TERM IMPAIR THE KNOBBLY. THAT IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IT IS UNFORGIVABLE TO NOT EXERCISE THAT RIGHT BOMB TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO DO WANT TO VOTE DO THE RIGHT TO. THE EXERCISE THAT BOAT BY MAKING ANOTHER OP AVAIL TO THEM. THIS MEASURE MAKE SURE THAT EVERY I JUST HAD VOTER IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION IS SICK. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION AND THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH IF THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE PHYSICALLY GOING TO STAND IN LINE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS STILL GOING ON AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT WILL END. UP OUT OF THAT CALIFORNIA. SIXTY PER CENT CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE NOW PERMANENT VOTE BY MAIL VOTERS. MY HOME COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND FOURTEEN OTHER COUNTIES- I HAVE. THE COLLECTIONS ARE WHERE IN EVERY REGISTERED VOTER RECEIVES A BALLOT IN THE MAIL- I SUPPORT AB EIGHT SIXTY AS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS TO IT ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE NOT FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR HALF OF AN EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE THAT AND- SEND. BAIT YEAH. ALL CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YEAH THANK YOU CAN READ I HAVE COME NOT OF THE VOTE BY MAIL PROCESS CITY WORKED WELL OUR IN OUR IN COUNTY IS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND THE COSTA MESA. I DIDN'T SUPPORT SO MOVING TOTALLY TO THAT WE HAVE AND YET THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT AND IT HAS WORKED WELL THAT IS NOT MY CONCERN MY CONCERN AGAIN GOES TO THE SEVENTEEN DAY I DELAY AND THAT THAT'S REALLY A PROBLEM CERTAINLY FOR EVERY COUNTY. GENES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. WHETHER YEAH WE WIN THEIR SEAT FOR LOSE THEIR SEAT. ARE THERE THERE HAS BEEN NO DATA PRESENT TO A TO DO. SEVEN DAY WHEN IT TO THAT THE AT. IS STILL IN CHARGE OF A MALE IT IS GOING TO TAKE TWO AND A HALF WEEKS TO GET THERE. SO I YOU ARE WILL NOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THAT I URGE OUR AUTHOR AND OUR JOCKEY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN AT LEAST BANDS. IN FACT FOR ME AS TO WHAT. WE PICKS. DAY OUT OF. OUR THAT DOES. SO THE PEOPLE WHO AGREE CONCERN ABOUT THIS. DATING FRAUD AND I WE OUGHT ARE ELECTION SYSTEM TO BE. FOR THE FOR. BY ELECT. AND UNDERSTAND THE IS FAIR. ARE THAT IS JUST IT'S- IN A ACCURATE. SEVEN DAYS. AS THE THEIR SOME UP AGAIN THERE IN WE DON'T NEED MORE CA. THEORY GOING ON ON WITH REGARDS TO ELECTIONS SO I URGE AND NOBLE. LAYING OFF. STILL THERE TEENS. WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE QUESTIONS AND HE CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. IN THE CLOTHES. THAT'S APPROPRIATE. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES THAT. VOTING IS THE BEATING HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY. MAKING CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT. ROSS THIS IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO MARRY OUT. THE PRAGMATIC ASPECTS VOTING AS WELL AS MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF OUR DECISION. SO I. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS. IF WE ARE GOING INTO A ALL RICH ALL REGISTRANTS ARE GETTING A BALLOT. OR WE'RE EXPERTS I IMAGINE WE'RE GONNA BE EXPECTING A HIGHER TURNOUT BY VIRTUE OF THAT. DO YOU DO WE HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE CHATTING WITH THE- COUNTY IS ON WHAT THE WOULD ANTICIPATE TO BE THE INCREASED VOLUME OF VOTER PARTICIPATION IN A GIVEN COUNTY AND WHERE I'M GOING WITH THAT IS I THINK THERE'S A COST HERE THAT YOU WERE NOT POPULATING OUT BECAUSE IF WE PRIEST. BUT TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS NEW POLICY. I'M WONDERING IF THERE SHOULD BE. OPERATION ATTACHED TO THIS NEW PROGRAM. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE KEY KEY BECAUSE THE VOTING IS SACROSANCT BUT- THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF VOTING I THINK IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT SO MY OTHER QUESTION IS IT ONLY THE SERIAL THAT IS MAILED BY THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS TO THE REGISTRANT. FIVE THAT ALLOWS THE INDIVIDUAL TO- CAST A VOTE FOR CAN SOMEONE GO TO A COMPUTER PRINTOUT A BALLOT AND USE THAT AS SOME FORM OF PROXY. IS THAT I THINK IS GOES ALSO TO THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT A COUNTY REGISTRAR IS GOING TO NEED A CLERK IS GOING TO NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT. EACH TOM JONES OR TOM OR JONES OR TOM H. R. JONES ANY NAME VARIATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN THESE COUNTIES- WERE INDIVIDUALS GET MULTIPLE BALLOTS I THINK WE CAN ALL ATTEST- THAT- SOME FOLKS RECEIVE MULTIPLE BALLOTS BY NAME VARIATION I THINK I'VE GOT MY- THERE'S BALLOT. ABOUT FOR TIMES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME MAY FIRST MET AND NAME IN SAME PER. IF THOUGH I'M NOT NINETY YEARS. SO I THINK THERE'S AN INNER FROM INNER SAFEGUARD THAT I THINK WOULD BE HEALTH AND LASTLY IS THAT SEVENTY DAISY ISSUE. I'M CAN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. ARE NOT THE RULES THAT. AN INDIVIDUAL MUST PUT IN THE MAIL THEIR PAPER BALLOT BY ELECTION DAY. IS A BALLOT STILL GOOD IF IT'S MAILED OR DROPPED IN A BOX TWO DAYS LATER. IN THE WAS IT WAS THAT AND NOW. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE TO HAVE TIME DEFINITE IN THIS SEVENTEEN DAY VISIT EXTEND THE THIRTY DAY WINDOW THAT A- THAT A COUNTY CLERK. USES JUST FINE ELECTION. DOES THAT CHANGE THAT THIRTY DAY WINDOW SO DOES IT MAKE IT FORTY SEVEN NOW I DON'T KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE SENATOR CAN ADDRESS THEM ALL IN HIS CLOSING STATEMENTS OR RESPOND DIRECTLY NOW. THAT SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES THANK YOU IN RESPONSE TO AN EARLIER INQUIRY ABOUT VOTER FRAUD- YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG MANTRA BECAUSE- REALLY THE EFFORT IS TO TRY TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE. US LET'S BE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THERE ARE SO FEW CASES OF ACTUAL VOTER FRAUD- I THINK STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND IN CALIFORNIA. BY TWO TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THERE WERE A TOTAL OF FIFTY SIX. THE SIX CASES OF VOTER FRAUD AND HOW MANY MILLIONS OF VOTES. WERE CAST BUT IF THERE IS GREAT CONCERN. ABOUT THE PENALTIES FOR VOTER FRAUD. OUR COMMITTEE AND OR ATTEMPTING TO COMMIT VOTER FRAUD WILL GET SOMEONE UP TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON IT IS A FELONY. TAMPERING WITH THE VOTING SYSTEM. COULD GET YOU UP TO FOUR YEARS IN PRISON. CHANGING OR WRONGFULLY PLACING BALLOTS IS A FINE UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND UP TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON. MISS LEADING A VOTER WHO NEEDS ASSISTANCE IS UP TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON AND INTERFERING WITH THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT CAN GET YOU UP TO SIX MONTHS IN THE COUNTY JAIL AND A FINE OF UP TO TEN. DOLLARS NOTION NUMBER VOTE FRAUD IN THIS GREAT CONCERN ABOUT IT IN FACT THE CASES OF VOTER FRAUD THEY FOUND EARLIER WERE ACTUALLY COMMITTED BY CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS AND NOT VOTERS. SO THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. THAT IN THE NATION THE PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN A NATION WHERE WE HAVE SANTA OTHERS TO BE OVERSEERS AN OBSERVER IN THE SHINS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IF WE DO NOT VALUE THE RIGHT OF EVERY PERSON TO VOTE. WHO IS QUALIFIED TO VOTE THEN WE REALLY. DEMOCRATS GO AROUND THE WORLD WERE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CASTING BALLOTS AND IN FACT IF YOU SAW THE EMBARRASSING MASS THE RECORD TRUSTS TWO DAYS AGO IN GEORGIA. WHAT THERE ARE SOME THAT WAS WHAT A DISGRACE TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PULLS. WHY WHICH- THAT IF IT TAKES DAYS. IT WILL ALLOW IT THERE'S A REQUEST ABOUT THE BULLET OF A BALLOT IT ALLOWS THE REGISTRAR TO DO THAT EXAMINATION WHICH RAISES. THE MEME- ALL UP ALL THE SOME OF OUR FOLKS WHO REALLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE VOTED. SO SEVENTEEN ISN'T REALLY THAT MUCH I CAN YOU HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN A HOTLY CONTESTED ELECTION SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IT WAS MORE THAN SEVENTEEN DAYS TO GET ALL THE BALLOTS COUNTED IN GET THAT ELECTION VERIFY SO SEVENTEEN DAYS THE MAGIC NUMBER- BUT WE WANT THE PROCESS. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PUT AND CERTAINLY IN THE COLD AT NIGHT IT SHOULD ASIAN WHERE. WILL BE WILL BLOOD INTO. WE TAKE THE RIGHT OF VOTING EXCEL TO EVERY. THIS NOTION ABOUT HOW ALL THIS FRAUD IS COMMITTED IS TRUST A FARCE. IT IS NOT KILL IT IS NOT ACCURATE THE NUMBERS DO NOT SUPPORTED AND FRANKLY THEY NEVER HAVE SO I AM WILL TRY TO BUY THIS CONTINUED FRUSTRATION ABOUT THING THAT HAS BEEN DISPROVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IT WE VALUE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES COUNTRY LAST I LOOKED. SHOULD BE IN PART. IF IT COSTS AN EXTRA THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR THAT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO CONTINUEWOULD DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WHEN THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE TO BE HEARD IT IS AT LEAST AS STAND THAT THE MENTAL IMPRESSION I. THAT I. SENATE WEST OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAYS GENTLEMEN THIS IS A OF A ISSUE WITH THAT WE BEEN JUST HERE FOR MANY NOT ONLY HERE AND LET BUT FOR PRIOR. ALWAYS WHEN. WE UP ABOUT BUT OF COURSE THERE LOTS OF. WHY WHY WE DON'T HAVE BEEN. BATTLE MIND OF THAT BUT I WOULD REMIND EVERYBODY WE'RE GOING TO MAIL IN BALLOTS BECAUSE OF. DEMOCRAT FACED. AND CURRENTLY CAL. IF YOU COULD CASES WERE WORSE IN INCREASE. AN INFECTION CASES RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO REALLY CONSIDER THIS AN- AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT BY. OF THE CONTAINER SCHOOL. KEY IN KEEPING OUR OUR POLL WORKER SAFER MEMBER PER WORKERS ARE LARGE RETIRED INDIVIDUALS. ARE THEY ARE VOLUNTEERS THEIR TEMPORARY WORKERS AND THEY THEY ARE ON THE- SPECTRUM ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. OF A OF LOSE A LOT OF AN A- INFECTION. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEM AS WELL- EVERY POLL WORKER GETS CONTACT WITH A POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN ONE SINGLE DAY. IN WHEN ONE SINGLE MOMENT AND THAT IS A THREAT TO THEIR LIVES AND WE CAN SEE THAT BUT I ALSO WORRY EVERYONE THAT WE VOTING. OF THE SET IS GENERALLY BEEN QUITE A- FOR YOU KNOW WHERE FRAUD IS FOUND IN THE VOTING PROCESS- IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TO. FOR THAT LONG YEAH AND YOU KNOW IN MY EXPERIENCE. WHAT WHAT THE NORMAL- A IN THE PAST ELECTIONS I HAVE WITNESSED THAT AND IT'S KIND OF KNOWN THAT THE- THIRD THE LARGE UP OF THE LAW CHECK OF OUR- CONCERT. SALEM BUT THEN THEN THE ELECTION THAT'S ALL BEEN A SORE OF DEBATE IF WE GO TO IN WHO IS THAT. WHO'S PART MORE AND THAT'S BEEN THE SUB BUT- AS I'VE SPOKEN TO PAY IN CARS THEM. TO VOTE BALLOT LET OF THEM TELL ME I ENJOY. GOING TO THE POLLS I WANT TO GO TO THE POLLS. AND THAT'S US A SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN THIS PARTICULAR TIME. AND SEASON. IN WE'RE FACING A PANDEMIC THAT SERVER KILLING SO MANY AMERICANS. MORE MORE AMERICANS ARE DYING FROM THIS FIVE AND ANY THE WAY. OKAY ADDRESS ACCOUNT AND ARE BOSS EVERY COUNTY IS ALREADY SET UP TO RESPOND TO THE REGISTERED VOTERS THAT THEY HAVE ON FILE. OR ARE THEY ALREADY HAVE A BUDGET TO ADDRESS- THE PUT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A 100% VOTER TURNOUT AND THAT'S WHAT'S IN THERE BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO THAT'S THEIR JOB WE DON'T HAVE TO BACK FILL FUND BECAUSE OUR READY. I'M PREPARED TO DO THAT AND IN THE EVENT THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT'S NOT THIS LEGISLATURE'S FAULT THAT'S A LOCAL DECISION THAT WAS MADE. BACK A LOWER TURNOUT DO WE EXPECT THAT EVERYBODY THAT'S REGISTER THE VOTES GOING TO VOTE WELL YEAH REASONABLY WE ACCEPT THAT BREAKS UP THAT THEY'RE NOT BUT WE HAVE TO PREPARE IN CASE THEY DO. I BELIEVE THAT PICK MORE PEOPLE WILL OR WILL PARTY. BECAUSE OF AMOUNT HONESTLY I DON'T. I THINK WE'LL GET THE SAME RESULTS AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPE TAT JUST. ELECT NOT TO VOTE BY MY MAIL AND THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE PART OF THIS PROCESS IF WE DO. WE WOULD GET A 100% PARTICIPATION BY MAIL IN BALLOT BELIEVE ME WHY WOULDN'T WE DO THAT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN EVERYBODY TO VOTE. THAT'S THE AMERICAN THE SPARE IN THE AMERICAN SPIRIT LET'S GET EVERYBODY. TO VOTE. BUT THE REAL THREAT. THE REAL FOR. THE BIGGEST THREAT TO VOTER FRAUD HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE TO BE HONEST LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IT'S VOTER SUPPRESSION AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA RAISING THE INCIDENT OF GEORGIA WHERE PEOPLE WAITED. HOURS AND HOURS IN LINE. BECAUSE IT INSTEAD OF SOCIAL DISTANCING YOU HAD. BLOCKS AND BLOCKS OF THE LINE WHY THEY REDUCE THE POLLING SITES AND THAT TO THAT DISASTER OF THE MET THE VOTER MACHINES WERE NOT OPERATIONAL AND THAT WAS A DESK MR THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH POLL WORKERS. DESTIN'S THAT ALSO VOTERS ARE BEING HURT. THE FILES. AND THAT IS THE BIGGEST FRAUD HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WHEN SOMEBODY REGISTERED TO VOTE. EVERY SINGLE YEAR EVERY COUNTY GOES THROUGH- THOSE LISTS THEY THEY COMPARE- THOSE LISTS TO DEATH CERTIFICATES TO ROOT OUT PEOPLE THAT WAY. I WAS ACTUALLY CONTACTED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN REGISTERED FOR SO LONG. THAT MIGHT SIGNATURE OVER THE OVER THE COURSE OF THOSE YEARS HAS BEGUN TO CHANGE AND I WAS ACT CONTACT TO THE FILLUP NEW. UP ISSHIN AND I DO. OUR SIGNATURE. THE THING THAT THAT'S OF IRAN OF ABSENTEE BY HAVE TO BE COMPARED TO SIGNAL. AND THAT'S A SAFE AND THEY HAVE TO THEY AT YOUR BILL THAT'S A SAFE GUARDING CANCER OF TO APPEAL BY THAT'S- THERE ARE LOTS OF SAFEGUARDS I'M NOT SAYING IT'S PERFECT. I'M JUST. THAT'S BUT TO OUR ELECTIONS LIES AND I SUPPORTERS BECAUSE OF. I SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND ALL RIGHT NOW I THINK PEOPLE- WE HAVE THEIR ATTENTION IT'S TIME FOR US TO SPEND THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS KTM VOTER. THIS PROCESS EVERY WILL A BALLOT WILL C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; HAVE&lt;/c&gt;</u> TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT THEY THIS WILL. INCREASE THEIR SUSPENSION I THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT IT WILL RESULT IN THE BACK EITHER WAY. I LET ME DREAM LADIES AND GENTLEMEN US AND PLEASE- OFFER THE SAKE OF ALL OUR POOR WORKERS FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THE VOTERS. OF THE SAKE UP TO SEE THE EX OF THIS PANDEMIC FOR THIS. SENATOR THE MAN IN THANK YOU YEAH TO SPEAK ON THE ISSUE OUR FIRST OF ALL I THINK THIS IS JUST A GOOD COMMON SENSE MAY THE WILL ONLY KEEP TELL HEALTHY BUT TYPICALLY IN I THINK THAT THE MARKET WORKS ONLY WHEN EVERY SINGLE VOICES. WANTED TO SPEAK FOR THE ACT OF THE A LOT COULD OCCUR WHICH ARE AT ELECTION LOCALLY FOR YEARS I WAS CAST THEIR ASIAN. COME FROM STRANGERS I THINK THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I HEARD WAS NOT- BROUGHT IT WAS LITERALLY THROWING OUT LEGITIMATE. VOTERS OUT BECAUSE THEIR SIGNATURES THAT IN MATCH AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID FROM- AND VEHICLE. THAT IS SOMETHING BLOOD VERY FULLY HOT. SO AGAIN IT'S NOT AS THE A SELECT BALLOTS THE SUBMITTING THEM THEY'RE STILL VERIFICATION. THIS AND- THE BILL BONTA. THROWING LEGITIMATE DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A SIGNATURE IS MAX SO THEN WE WOULD BE ON THE UPPER TO AGAINST A META ON UPDATED SIGNET BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AT THE WILL. THE EIGHT. ARE TO ME THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. THE ELDERLY WALKED AWAY. BOB WOMEN WITH CHILDREN WALKED AWAY. WHEN YOU'RE HAVING TO STAND IN A LINE FOR FOUR FIVE HOURS. THAT IS REALLY NOT. THE GOAL I THINK OF CALIFORNIA AT LEAST FOR STATE OUR GOAL IS SURE. ONCE I GET THAT. IS HEARD AND I. WANT TO SUPPORT THE SMASHED THANK YOU. YOUR SKIN. THANK YOU I'VE. MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SO I REALIZE THAT OUR RULES OR ARE CAN SEE AN THIS FLOORS NOT TENDENCY OUR INTENT IS TO HAVE OUR DISCOURSE POLITE. BUT I'M NOT FEWER SO POLITE RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK MAYBE IT SAYS I'VE BEEN HOME ABOUT THREE MONTHS I THINK LIKE MOST OF YOU. AND HAD. THE BEEN WATCHING. MANY MORE MEDIA SOURCES THAN I HAD LUXURY TO DO BEFORE. IN READING MANY MORE FIVE REPORTS AND EDITORIALS. AND I HAVE BEEN APPALLED. AT THE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS BY. REPUBLICANS IN OTHER PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT HAVE BASICALLY WHERE THEY EXPLICITLY STATED THAT THEIR OPPOSITION TO VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS WAS BECAUSE IT WOULD INCREASE TURNOUT AND THUS POTENTIALLY THREATEN THEIR ELECTORAL. CHANCES OUT I AM NOT SAYING THAT MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THIS FLOOR FEEL THAT WAY I'M JUST REPORTING. FACTUAL WHAT WAS STATED IN HER. AND IT CALLS ME. BUT THE LEAST THEIR UP FRONT ABOUT THEIR REASONS SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION WE KNOW THAT IT IS A PRESS BY MANY AS A FINE ART. STRONG BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND YES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS TO NOT HAVE TO GO OUT DURING A PANDEMIC WE SHOULD DO VOTE BY MAIL REGARDLESS. AND NOT ONLY THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE AUTOMATIC LITTER REGISTRATION. IS NOT REQUIRED THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS A FAILURE. WHERE TO VOTE WHICH IS THE AUSTRALIAN LAW. BUT THEY TURN EIGHTEEN IN THIS AUTOMATIC BEYOND THE ROLES FIFTY DON'T CHOOSE TO UTILIZE THEIR FRANCHISE MEANT THAT'S FINE THAT'S UP TO THEM. BUT RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY ARE WE EXPERIENCING VOTER SUPPRESSION. WE'RE ALSO SEEING DROPS IN REGISTRATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE MAKE IT NOT ONLY HARD TO VOTE WE MAKE IT HARD TO REGISTER AND IT'S WRONG AND WE SHOULD ELIMINATE EVERY CALL CORRECT THREE IN PUTTING I STAND STRONG SUPPORTER. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST A CLARIFICATION ON THE SEVENTEEN DAYS BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL THINKING POSTMARKED AND PAY ATTENTION TO- THE BILL ITSELF IT IS- SELF CERTIFICATION YOU CAN SIGN IT AND SAY THAT YOU'RE SIGNING UP ON ELECTION DAY BEFORE OR BY EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT PM SO PAY ATTENTION WITHOUT WHAT. AS WITH REGARDS SEVENTEEN DAYS NOT RECEIVING IT ON. THE TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER ELECTION IT CAN BE RECEIVED FIFTEEN DAYS BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU FILL THAT OUT FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE. IN A CENTER THERE DROP IT OFF TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT THAT BOX THAT. IS IN A FRAT. ALL OF THE CALM THAT ARE MADE HERE TODAY THAT WE WANT IT ALL TO BE HONEST AND YOU KNOW NO VOTER SUPPRESSION ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT DON'T GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THAT FOR THOSE OF THOSE WHO DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES TO UP IN AN ELECTION. A CALL THE BARS IS RETURNING TO THIS HOUSE. WHO WON A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SEAT BY THREE VOTES. SOMEONE CAN SELF CERTIFY WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S THE MARK. AND GET THAT BALLOT IN AND CHANGEABLE ELECTION. WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT. IN THAT WE COULD MAKE THIS A PERFECT A PERFECT BILL BUT THE SEVENTEEN DAYS OF SELF CERTIFICATION. CHALLENGE OUR IT'S LEGITIMACY. THANK YOU. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR UMBERG YOU MAKE CONCLUDE. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND- MEMBERS LET ME SEE IF I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AS TO THE PENALTIES AYE I THANK SENATOR HERTZBERG AND SENATOR JACKSON FOR A SIGNATURE ISSUE. WHAT WHAT COULD BE UP TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON FOR VOTE FRAUD. OF BOTH FRIES EXTREMELY RARE- I ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH SENATOR HUESO COMMENTS THAT THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME IS NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE VOTING IT'S FOLKS THAT. AREN'T AND- ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE THE- I CAME PUBLIC OFFICE BECAUSE EVENT THAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OUR OWN COUNTY OF ORANGE. WHERE THEY WERE PEOPLE DRESSED AS POLICE OFFICERS STANDING AT POLLING PLACES IN LARGE LATINO AREAS SANTA ANA. SIGN SAID NON CITIZENS MAY NOT VOTE AND THEY WERE ASKING FOR PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP FOR WE COULD. BELIEVE IT OR NOT NOT A LOT THE TIME IT IS. HEY IF THE POINTS OF THE- BOB. TEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. PRESS A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES. IT THE DOES FORCE DAYS AND FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN THE MILITARY AND YOU DON'T HAVE A POSTMARK AND YOU SIGN USE CERTAIN YOU SENT IT YOU MAY ELECTION DAY IT WILL BE CAP. YES WITH RESPECT TO THE VOTE COUNTED AFTER ELECTION DAY IS REALLY A NON ISSUE IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A CLOSE ELECTION ONE CAN TAKE A LOOK AND SEE ONE CAN ACTUALLY. GO TO THAT INDIVIDUAL VOTE OR IF THEY'VE NOT CERTIFIED IT PROPERLY. UP THE ISSUE CONCERNING SPEARS YES THERE ARE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OF CONSPIRACY THEORY EXTRATERRESTRIALS WILL BE VOTING IN THIS YEAR'S ELECTION. THERE ARE NUMBER OF CONSPIRACY SOME OF THEM. SOME FOLKS- HOT IN IN OUR OUR FEDERAL. TURNS COSTS YES. COST HERE BEEN S. BY ON WHAT. THE REGISTRAR'S BELIEVE WILL BE THE VOTER TURN OUT IN NOVEMBER. NO SAYS WHAT THE MORE COST THE DIVISIONAL WILL BE THERE WILL BE SOME MARGINAL COST THIS YEAR BUT AGAIN THAT'S A VALUE STATEMENT ON OUR PART IS TO WHAT WE VALUE AND WHAT WE- BUDGET. SO SIT SO. THAT IS EXACTLY WE'RE ABOUT IN THIS IS SUCH BURDEN VALUE THAT WE SHOULD APPROPRIATE RESOURCES- IN TERMS OF. THE ADDITIONAL OTHER COSTS- SOME HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED BY THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS ALREADY BUT THERE IS ALSOAN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD. OUR ESTIMATES EXCEED EVEN WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE DAY THAT THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PETITION THE SECRETARY STATE FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ADDITIONAL. STRIKE FORCE TO HELP PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES AND COUNTIES IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO QUOTE SO FOR EXAMPLE IT MAY BE MORE CHALLENGING TO GET. FOLKS TO WORK THE THIS YEAR. DARKLY A SENIOR CITIZEN THE POLLS AND IT MAY REQUIRE US TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL. GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT ALL IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT OF ALL OF THAT IN FRANCE DISS. ALL IN ALL THIS IS A BILL THE TEXT HELL. CALIFORNIANS ALSO EMBRACES. TO VOTE I. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA OR AYE ATKINS I BATES. NO BELL I FORGES.
