FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE ARE RIGHT HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OF THREE. ALL RIGHT LAYS IN GERMAN ONCE AGAIN NOW WE HAVE ONE ITEM ON TODAY'S DOCKET. AND THAT IS AS THE MEMBER WARDS AB FIVE HUNDRED. SUMMER WARD I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANKS FOR WORKING WITH COMMITTEE THAT WERE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR PARTNERSHIP HERE- AND- SOME REWARD HAS REALLY BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAN WORK. IN FOCUSING ON DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING- IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AS A MEMBER MORE. THAT YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE INTER BETWEEN THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE STREAMLINED UNDER THIS BILL IN THE STATE'S EFFORT ON HOME KEY I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A FULL. PIECE OF TESTIMONY BACK TO BE ABLE TO FILL HERE TODAY BUT ON THAT ISSUE OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS ON HOME KEEN STREAMLINING I THINK THAT'S AN AREA THAT YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON FOR POTENTIAL CLEAN UP. BEFORE YOU GET INTO THAT- IF YOU DON'T MIND I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT IS NOT THE CASE THANK YOU RESEARCH AREA ABSOLUTELY A LONG TIME SUPPORTER OF MANY OF THE EXISTING STATUTORY LABOR PROVISIONS THAT APPLY TO HIM HE PROJECTS AND CERTAINLY WOULD BE. HAPPY TO COMMIT TO WORKING ON SOME FORM OF LEGISLATION WHETHER IT'S FOR MY OWN. FUTURE WORK OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S VEHICLE ABOUT THE VEHICLE AND THEN MAKE SURE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CLARIFIED FOR AGAIN THE VERY SAME- TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY EXISTING UNDER PROJECT ON P. THAT'S GREAT SO WHATEVER IS EXISTING THE STATUTORY LABOR PROVISIONS. THAT APPLY TO HUNKY PROJECTS NOW THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT CLEAN UP EITHER THROUGH YOUR OWN PERSONALIZATION POTENTIALLY THROUGH THE BUDGET. IN JANUARY SIR AND WITH YOU YES THANK YOU SO MUCH A 100% AND- ABSOLUTELY LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. AS A MORE WORK ON THIS AND AGAIN DECEMBER WARD THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH COMMITTEE- A LONG WAYS TO CLOSE THE COMMISSION OVER THESE PAST MANY MONTHS WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE SIR. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THAN YOU CENTER AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY GREAT PLACE TO START BECAUSE THIS BILL AB FIVE HUNDRED IS ABOUT CONSISTENCY IS ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF THE HOUSING PRODUCTION THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IN MANY OF OUR WONDERFUL. RESIDENTIAL ZONES ARE ACTUALLY STREAMLINED AND AFFORDED NOT JUST FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHICH WE'VE ALREADY OUT- ASCERTAIN THROUGH PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. ALSO THROUGH THE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS A SEPARATE PROCESS THAT IS REGULATED BY THE STATE. WE KNOW THE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A HUGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WITH THE DEFICIENCY OF THREE MILLION. HOMES AND GROWING IT'S EXACERBATED IN SOME OF THESE PRESIDENTIAL ISSUES IN THE COASTAL ZONE WHERE DEVELOPMENTS FACED A NUMBER OF VERY SPECIFIC AREAS CHALLENGES. EDUS SUPPORTABLE HOUSE SUPPORTED HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO. HELP. ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS FOR MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME CAL. YEAH THEY ARE UNDER YOU'D- IN THE COAST ZONE BECAUSE- OF THE- INTO. BUT NECESSARY. PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. AND AS I MENTIONED WE'VE IN RECENT YEARS PASS LAWS TO STREAMLINE THAT. FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT HE DID NOT EXTEND TO SEE PEACE SO THAT'S WHERE AB FIVE HUNDRED COMES IN AND CONNECTS THESE DOTS. IT WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AMANDA LOCAL POSTAL PROGRAMS BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TO IDENTIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN LOCATIONS ON THE WEST EIGHTY USE TRINITY USE. LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTERS. SUPPORTED HOUSING PROJECTS AND 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WOULD BE EXEMPT OR QUALIFY FOR. A WAIVER FOR THE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. APPROVING THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE DEVELOPERS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE REGULATIONS AND TIMELINES FOR LOW IMPACT HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH ME ON THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DO SO OVER THE SUMMER RECESS.

CALIFORNIA HAS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS BUT IT ALSO HAS A LABOR CRISIS IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. AS A RECENT UC BERKELEY STUDY POINTED OUT THE NEARLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FAMILY PROGRAMS A YEAR GOES TO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES OF RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. WHO ARE NOT PAID ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE BASIC NEEDS OF THEIR FAMILIES. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IT SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO EVERY SINGLE ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE STATE. WE HAVE STOOD BY IN THE PAST TO STREAMLINING BILLS WERE PASSED WITH PROMISES OF HIGH ROAD LABOR PRACTICES AND WHAT WE SAW IS AN EMBOLDENING OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY WHERE WORKERS RISK THEIR LIVES. WORK IN BLAZING HEAT LIKE TODAY AND ARE NOT GIVEN THE RESPECT OF EVEN A FAIR WAGE. WE HAVE SPOKEN TO WORKERS ALL OVER THE STATE I'M PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY LEGISLATIVE STREAMLINING AND THE TAXPAYERS THAT SYSTEMATICALLY CHEAP WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE SHOULD BE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE OVER THE BACKS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD DO BETTER THAN THAT.

HERE TODAY PLEASE CENTER DRAWS OF FORESTERS. YES IF THE AUTHOR COULD SPEAK TO THE LABOR ISSUES. THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ON- SORT OF AT A LOSS HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR OF HAVING TO I'M AT A LOSS AS WELL- DESPITE I THINK FIRST DISCUSSING THIS BLL WITH US SOME OF THE- NOW OPPONENTS AS EARLY AS MARCH OF THIS YEAR. IT WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT NINETY MINUTES AGO THAT I RECEIVED ANY COMMUNICATION THERE WAS ANYTHING SPECIFIC WITH THIS BILL UP AS I SAID MY OPENING STATEMENT I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. MAKING SURE THE CONSISTENCY THERE FOR EXISTING STATUTORY LABOR PROTECTIONS WHICH I SUPPORT. FOR MANY OF THE SAME PROJECTS IS REFLECTED IN CONSISTENT WITH THE BILL HERE. SAID THIS BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND BE SIGNED INTO LAW THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THAT ANYTHING YOU KNOW WELL YOU SERVED ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION. BEFORE AS WELL THIS IS A SPECIAL BUT ADDITIVE LAYER OF REVIEW THAT WE HAVE ABOVE EVEN LOCAL JURISDICTION ADOPTION MANY OF THESE- STREAMLINING OR OTHER CONDITIONS THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING ON SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL PROJECTS. HAVE BEEN AFFORDED HER HAVE HAD THAT DISCUSSION AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION LEVEL AND SO WE'RE WE'RE HAVING THE SKILLED AND TRAINED LANGUAGE PREVAILING WAGE AND OTHER. LABOUR PROVISIONS APPLIED ARE LIKELY ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE UNDERLYING PROJECT WHICH WAS POSSIBLY APPROVED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS IS MAKES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S REVIEW. THAT THAT- AS WE LOOK FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES AS WE LOOK TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE. AFFORDING ADDITIONAL. A PORTABLE HOUSING. OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORK FOR ARE FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA. THAT CLOSE OF A VIOLENT CRIME PROCESS IS ALSO STREAMLINED. WELL SO. IS THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WAS THIS- JUST A CHANGE DID YOU HAVE DID YOUR RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH. THE LABOR ISSUES ANY BUILDING YOU SEE BEFORE YOU- WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION IN COMMITTEE- WHAT WAS REMOVED WAS THE MORE EXPENSIVE CONVERSATION AROUND THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY AROUND HOUSING POLICIES IN THE LOCAL COASTAL PLANS. MAY I HAVE. YOUR PLEASE THEY SHOULD HAVE THEY COULD RESPOND TO THAT. I MEAN WE DO WE TYPICALLY DON'T DO THAT NOW THAT WE'VE CLOSED PUBLIC TESTIMONY OKAY I'M JUST TRYING TO. GET A OF FEEL HERE I MEAN THIS WAS. THIS IS MOVING FORWARD BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'S ALL THIS OPPOSITION FROM FROM THE BUILDING TRADES AND ARE WE GOING TO FIX THIS. BECAUSE OF YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE WILLING TO OR YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THE BUILDING TRADE LABOR STANDARDS THAN. HOW DO WE GET THERE AT THIS POINT IN TIME I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT COULD SOMEBODY MAYBE THAT COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS SOMEBODY ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WHAT WHAT I CAN SAY IS I THINK ON THE ISSUE AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO SPEAK. FOR ANY ORGANIZATION I THINK THAT THERE IS CONCERN IN REGARDS TO STREAMLINING WHETHER IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ON THE ISSUE- PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHERE AND I WANT TO WORDS IN THE SOME MEMBERS MATH- WHERE THESE TO MEMBER IS COMMITTED TO BE ABLE TO FIX- ON ANY PROJECT HOME KEY DEVELOPMENT. THAT IS IT VANCE. UNDER THIS BILL THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE CLEAN UP NEXT YEAR TO ENSURE THAT- THE LABOR PROVISIONS. THAT ARE ALREADY IN STATE STATUTE NOW. VIA SKILLED AND TRAINED THAT WOULD BE ADVANCED WITH THIS BILL SO FOR EXAMPLE- IF. UNDER PROJECT COUNTY RIGHT NOW. IF A SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS GRANTED FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT- OR REMODELING REHAB. THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CAN EXCEED CAN RECEIVE THAT- SECRET TENSION BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD SKILLED AND TRAINED- AND THAT IS WHAT THE REFLECTION WILL BE. IS ENSURING THAT THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT'S IN LINE NOW. IT WOULD NOT APPLY 2100% AFFORDABLE SO RIGHT NOW THIS BILL- REQUEST THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. SUBMIT AND THE LOCAL COASTAL PLAN AMENDMENT- TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENTS- OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS NAVIGATION CENTERS 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALONG WITH PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- ON THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PIECE WITH HUNKY. THOSE AMENDMENTS CLARIFYING THAT HUNKY STILL MUST BE BUILT SKILLED TRAINERS BECAUSE EMISSIONS WOULD BE CLEANED UP- THIS COMING YEAR AS FAR AS A NOT BE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ON THAT IN THIS BILL THE OTHER SIGNIFICAN AMENDMENT THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN IN PLEASES A MEMBER WARD PUSHED BACK TO ME THINK I'M- MISTAKEN. IS ON HAZARDOUS AREAS SO- CENTER WIENER ON THE OF HOUSING CENTER STERN A BEHALF NOT TO RESOURCES IN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE ALL BEEN MEETING TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO GET CONSENSUS. ON AND ON THAT ISSUE ON IT IF THERE IS A HAZARDOUS FIRE ZONE. AND THE COMMUNITY I CAN'T MITIGATE FOR THOSE. HAZARDOUS FIRE CONDITIONS DANA DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE STOPPED SO THAT'S ALL I'M PARAPHRASING HERE THAT IS ALSO IN THIS BILL IS WELL THE LAST PIECE OF SAY IS THIS BILL THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY IN FRONT OF US WAS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND THIS BILL NOW IS MUCH MORE STRATEGIC FOCUSING ON- THOSE AFFORDABLE. HOUSING STOCK OR NIGHT NAVIGATION CENTERS THAT CAN GET DEPLOYED- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT SOME REWARD I DON'T WANT TO EVER PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH YOU KNOW TURN OVER THE MAJORITY LEADER RIGHT AFTER SENATOR ALSO MAY BE DONE BUT- THIS SUMMER WARD I DON'T WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S ACCURATE ABOUT WHICH IS A 100% ACCURATE I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD AGAIN TO SORT OF SIMPLIFY THIS IS IT IF YOU HAVE THE PROJECT IS MOVING FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE THE SENATE'S PREVIOUS WORK ON. PROJECT HOME CAN'T ALIGN THAT WITH SOME OF OUR LABOR STANDARDS AND IF YOU HAVE THAT PROJECT THIS MOVE FOR THAT'S BEEN ADOPTED BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION YOU WILL HAVE THOSE REQUIREMENTS ALREADY IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS A PROVISION REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO EVEN MOVE FORWARD TO RECEIVE THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS APPROVAL SO NOW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO THEN TAKE A PROTOTYPICAL SO YOU DON'T HAVE A PROJECT FROM STREET TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION YOU STILL NEED UNDERLYING LOCAL JURISDICTION REVIEW AND APPROVAL BEFORE THEN. THE COUNCIL COMMISSIONER UNDER ITS PURVIEW SO I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE KNOWING THAT MANY OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THE SENATE'S PREVIOUS WORK ARE GOING TO BE CAPTURED HERE AND IF IT HELPS THE OPPOSITION BECOME ALSO COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I CERTAINLY HAVE COMMITTED AND I'LL SAY FOR A THIRD TIME THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS THROUGH CLARIFYING LEGISLATION IN SOME FORM AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO AMBIGUITY- AND NO DISCONNECT THERE. IN CENTER DRAWS. IT WERE NOW IN- THE- AS DRESS I KNOW ASKED FOR UP. INTENT WE'RE NOT IN THE CLOTHES. I WANNA BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SIXTY SECONDS. TO REPRESENT OF THE BUILDING TRADES ON THIS QUESTION IS WELL AND THEN I WILL TURN BACK TO CENTER DRAWS SO- AND THEN GO TO THE MAJORITY LEADER. I MISS THE HAND ON BEHALF OF THE BUILDING TRADE SIXTY SECONDS PLEASE CONSIDER DRESSES QUESTION PEOPLE MIGHT- I JUST WISH THAT. WE CAN MARK THE SECOND HERE. IF YOU DON'T MIND GETTING CLOSER TO THE MIKE I'M SO SORRY. THAT IN THE MEDIA STATEN CAN WE JUST DO A QUICK MIKE TEST. SHE SHE'S ON OKAY PLEASE ASSIGN. WHEN THIS BILL INITIALLY- CAME FORWARD WE WERE AT WE VOICE CONCERN WITH IT BECAUSE OF THE STREAMLINING ASPECT AND WHAT THAT WOULD DO- FOR LABOR STANDARDS ON AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. IN THE COASTAL JURISDICTION- IN THIS BILL WAS THEN MADE INTO OVER AN EXPANSIVE BILL STUDYING HOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION. COULD PARTICIPATE IN STREAMLINING THE ANALYSIS ON THIS BILL ITSELF RIGHT NOW SAYS IT CREATES A CONFLICT I THINK THEY REFERRED TO AN ANALYSIS. AS TO MASTERS. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT EVEN A PROCESS HERE BY WHICH THE STREAMLINING WOOD WHAT HAPPENED FROM COASTAL ON TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS IN WHATEVER THIS PROCESS IS. THE VOICES OF OUR HALF A MILLION MEMBERS AND MANY OF WHO LIVE WITHIN THE COASTAL COMMISSION JURISDICTION WILL NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT OCCUR IN THEIR HOME TOWNS. THANK YOU SO MUCH WRESTLING. TEAM IS THE MAIN WILL BE IF IT WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SHOW- TAKE THAT UP ON BEHALF OF THE BUILDING TRADES. A CENTER DRIVE SO BEFORE WE TURN OVER TO THE MAJORITY LEADER I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE CONCLUDED YOUR REMARKS IN MISTER MAJORITY LEADER BEFORE WE GO TO YOU WOULD LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM IS WELL.

WORKING OUT THE DETAILS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING AND INTO TIME TALKING TO THE WORKING FOLKS OF THE BUILDING TRADES THAT THEY THAT. AND CONFIRM IT AGAIN HERE TODAY. THAT THEIR CONCERNS WERE BEING TAKEN CARE OF THE POINTS THAT CENTER DROSTE SPECIFICALLY MADE THAT ARE DEEPLY CONCERNING TO ME. AND THEY TELL ME THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THE AMENDMENTS HAD CHALLENGES THAT- WE'RE LAST MINUTE SO HEY JUST RAISE THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO HERE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WERE GEORGE BUT I ALSO WAS BASED UPON THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING. AND I WANT TO- TO. HELP DEALING WITH YOU ON ON THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY'RE PRETTY THEY'RE PRETTY IMPORTANT MY JUDGMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER INTERNALLY- WOULD YOU LIKE TO AUTHORED TO RESPOND PLEASE PLEASE AT SOME NUMBER THE FOUR SOURCE THANK YOU UNDERSERVED MAJORITY LEADER- AND AGAIN I ALSO SURFACED CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE PRETTY DARN IMPORTANT AS WELL TO- AND- AND LESS TIME- YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY FADING IN MY MEMORY AT AGE FORTY FIVE. I HAVE NOT HEARD THESE CONCERNS UNTIL NINETY MINUTES PRIOR TO THIS HEARING- AND PRACTICES NOT ON RECORD AT THE LAST COMMITTEE HEARING THAT WE HAD WHEN THE BILL WAS- PRIOR TO ITS BEING OF POLITICAL STUDY DOLLARS YOU REMEMBER. I THANK HEARING WE TOOK THOSE AMENDMENTS WHICH THEN TRANSFORMED INTO A STUDY BILL AS OF JULY THIRTEENTH PRIOR TO THAT ALL THIS LANGUAGE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY ONCE IN PRINT. DID REALLY DIRECT THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO ALIGN SOME OF ITS STREAMLINING PROVISIONS- WITH THE SAME KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT ARE STREAMLINED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE TELEVISION QUESTION- TOWARD THE- BUT IF SOMETHING WAS STUDY BY. COME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THEN IT'S STILL BILL IN ANYBODY HEADED THE- DOESN'T CARE BECAUSE IT'S STUDY BILL. AND IF IT COMES BACK WITH PROVISIONS DOESN'T THAT BRING BACK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT. OTHERWISE REYES TO ME. IF IT WAS A STUDY BILL AND THEN COMES BACK NOW. THE FINAL MONTH AND A HALF TWO MONTHS LATER SO AND IN IN A FORM THAT WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WAS. SEEMS TO ME THAT CREATES SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS NOW- SO AS WE HAD WORKED WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WAS INTRODUCED TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE TIME- I BELIEVE. MAYBE YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO BE HERE FOR THE PRESENTATION ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON IT- THERE WAS AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS BILL AND WE WERE VERY TRANSPARENT.% THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE MOVING THIS FORWARD AND S. ANY. STRONGLY AMENDED FORM TO STUDY BILL. THAT IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE SUMMER RECESS WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDER AGENT GROUPS. WHICH HAVE SINCE COME OFTEN MOVED TO NEUTRALITY. THAT WE WERE THEN GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE FINAL FORM. BACK INTO pITS- WHAT YOU SEE HERE TODAY THROUGH THE SENATE RULE TWENTY NINE POINT TEN PROCESS. OKAY. RICHARD ANY OTHER ITEMS YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS AT THIS TIME. YEAH IT JUST LAST QUESTION IS. AS PART OF THE STAKEHOLDERS DID YOU CIRCLE BACK WITH- LABOR ON THIS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN- AND WHO IS INVOLVED. IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. ALTHOUGH I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THIS BILL AS EARLY AS MARCH OF THIS YEAR- WITH BOTH THE STATE AND SOME OF MY LOCAL TRADES MEMBERS. THEY HAVE NOT EXPRESSED ANY INTEREST OR POINT OF VIEW ON THIS BILL-TO MY FACE. OKAY INTERLUDE OR ANYTHING ELSE THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GONNA GO TO CENTER WINNER THERE AND COME BACK TO CENTER DRAWS OF PLEASE ENTER WIENER. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S. COMMITMENT TO- TO RESOLVING THIS WITH CLEAN UP LEGISLATION LAST YEAR WHETHER IT'S YOUR OWN VEHICLE OR- OR A DIFFERENT VEHICLE AND- AND OBVIOUSLY THE HOME KEY ISSUE HAS. BE THE HOME IS YOUR HAS TO BE OF SEX I PRE. OKAY NOT A MINIMUM- WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT THIS BILL IS HOUSING COMMITTEE. WE WERE THE THIRD REFERRAL- AND ONLY THEY'RE ONLY TO GOD THROUGH REFERRALS AND NOT GET HEARINGS THIS YEAR- SO THE AUTHOR- COULD HAVE DONE WITH SOME OTHERS DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS IS SORT OF TALKED. NOT REALLY TAKE SERIOUSLY THE- THE VIEWS OF THE THIRD COMMITTEE AND IT JUST BECOMES A PARAGRAPH IN A BILL ANALYSIS. BUT THE AUTHOR TOOK OUR FEEDBACK ABOUT VARIOUS ISSUES- VERY VERY SERIOUSLY AND WORKED INTENSIVELY WITH- SENATE MCGUIRE IN THIS COMMITTEE WITH OUR COMMITTEE- AND- KEPT HIS WORD ON EVERYTHING HE COMMITTED TO- AND BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO RESOLVE THINGS AND IS DONE THE SAME. WITH STAKEHOLDERS- IN A VERY HARD BILL IN TERMS OF THE BUILDING THAT POTENTIAL WAR BETWEEN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AND THE COASTAL COMMISSION IN CITIES IN THE COASTAL COMMISSION- AND THE BILL HAS BEEN. SCALED BACK ON QUITE A BIT AND SO I'VE- GIVEN OF THE AUTHOR AS HAVING METICULOUSLY KEPT HIS WORD- OCTANT. TO ALL THE COMMITTEES INVOLVED- I- ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THAT HE'S GOING TO DO. WHAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO AND I KNOW. WILL. MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS AND I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND CENTER WE'RE GONNA GO CENTER DRESSER JEFF OTHER ITEMS. SUCH AS A DOCTOR THANK A QUESTION HERE IN TERMS OF- I WOULD I REMEMBER BEING IN A COMMITTEE HEARING THE WEEK OF THE FINAL VOTE WITH SISTER A COUPLE OF DAYS. BUT- IS THERE A PROCESS WHEREBY. AND THIS IS A VERY VERY HUGE ASSUMPTION. ASSUMING THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD AGREE TO THE CHANGES AS HE'S- ASSISTANT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAYING TODAY THAT IT WOULD HE'S COMMITTED TO MAKING CHANGES THAT WOULD INCORPORATE OF THE LABOR PROTECTIONS. OF CAN THAT BE DONE. NOW MISS WHERE WE'RE AT IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OF THIS SESSION CAN THOSE CHANGES BE MADE AND IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AT THIS POINT- AND JUST BEING CANDID NO LOOKS A MAJORITY LEADER ON THAT AS WELL- SO. LOOK I THINK THAT. JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT THIS AND JUST TALKING THIS OUT- CENTER WINNERS RIGHT DID WITH THE WHERE THIS BILL STARTED. AND IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD- JOB OFFICER HAS COME AN INCREDIBLY LONG WAY- IN WE'VE HAD- VERY. OPEN AND BLUNT DISCUSSIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COASTAL COMMISSION ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THE ORIGINAL BILL. AND I WANT TO ALSO SAY THANK YOU TO THE COAST COMMISSION- REPRESENTATIVES AS FAR AS OUR STAFF AND TO THIS A MEMBER FOR WORKING THROUGH. pWINNER IS RIGHT HI THIS IS BEEN A COMPLICATED ONE- AND TRYING TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH SOME PRICKLY PEAR- THE ISSUES- IT IS HOW WE GOT HERE TODAY. REGARDING THE ISSUE- FOR SENATOR I WAS IT WAS JUST COVERING SO ELOQUENTLY IN APPRECIATE AS AN ADDRESS THAT WAS. NUMBER ONE. THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE CLEAN UP. YEAH AND I. LOOK TO THE SENATOR AFFIRM WHAT I'M SAYING HERE. CLEAN UP EITHER THROUGH A PERSONAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN JANUARY THAT WOULD BE FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT ANY PROJECT FROM KEYSIGHT- WOULD BE THAT ABIDE BY THE SAME STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN LAW- AND OR THAT LANGUAGE COULD BE PUT INTO- A POTENTIAL BUDGET BILL FOCUS ON WHERE PROJECT HUNKY IS WELL WHICH IS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST. SO THAT'S THAT'S ALSO BUT THE AUTHOR HAS COMMITTED TO BE TO DO PERSONALIZATION- ON THE ISSUE PROJECT HUNKY NOW AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK FOR A GROUP I KNOW THAT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH THOUGH FOR THE BUILDING TRADES- AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM. AND WHERE THEIR CONCERN IS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE SAME SKILLED AND TRAINED PROTECTIONS IN REGARDS TO FOR WORKING MEN AND WOMEN ON THE THAT IS NOT IN FRONT OF US AS FAR AS POTENTIAL CLEANUP I. THE CLEAN UP RELATED TO- HUNKY IN SKILLED ENTRY. SO THAT IS WHERE WE'RE AT- HERE TO DAY AND THAT WAS TO COME IN AND BY THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S WHILE THERE IS A NUMBER AGAIN I DON'T WANT TOWARDS YOUR MOUTH. AND I DON'T MEAN TO KEEP COMING BACK TO YOU BUT I DON'T WANT ANYBODY COULDN'T. ANY WORDS IN MY MOUTH SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACCURATE SIR I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR ON IT WOULD BE OKAY CANASTA LONGHOUSE MIGHT LEAD WITNESS TO POSSIBLY ALSO ADDRESSES ANOTHER EXCEPT NOT AWFULLY INTEGRAL PARTNER AND HOW WE MIGHT IMPLEMENT THIS IS A CALL ON ZERO CHRISTY. ABSOLUTELY SO- WE'RE GONNA BUT SINCE WE'RE NOT IN THE CLOTHES ARE GONNA BRING BACKS HERE CHRISTIE- FROM THE COASTAL COMMISSION. BUT MISS CHRISTY. GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR WITH US. THANK YOU SENATOR REQUIRED CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES SIR PLEASE PROCEED ON US IN OUR DRAWS THIS QUESTION. SURE I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION IF THAT IS HELPFUL- FIRST OF ALL THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE- CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. THE PROJECT HOME HERE WHEN HE THOUGHT ARE GOING TO CHANGE IN WITH THIS BILL ALL THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO IS REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THURMOND TERREL C. P.'S TO SPECIFY THE LOCATIONS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THOSE PROJECTS WILL TELL NOTHING NOTHING'S GOING TO ANY ANY REQUIREMENTS THAT ALREADY ATTEND THOSE PROJECTS FROM EXISTING LOT WILL STILL CARRY OVER IT'S JUST GOING TO BE. THAT THERE WILL BE AFFIRMATIVE STATEMENTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF CLARITY IN THE L. C. P. ABOUT THOSE PROJECTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDERTAKING PROJECTS IN THE COASTAL TOWN WHAT. THE FIND OUT WHERE THE RULES ARE. SO I. THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A SINGLE ADDITIONAL PROJECT IT'S GOING TO COME TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. THAT WOULDN'T ALREADY COME TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION. THIS IS ABOUT AGAIN AMENDING THE LOCAL PLANS. HOUSING HI. SO IT'S THE SENSUALLY JUST A BILL TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. ANY OF THE EXISTING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AROUND THOSE BELTS I HOPE I HOPE THAT THAT IS HELPFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS CHRISTY ON THE QUESTION CENTER AS A POLICE. WELL I'M YOU KNOW. MR THE FIRST TIME WILL BE A YOU KNOW SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO TWO SIDES THAT WE AGREE I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR INTENTION TO. BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE COAST AND YOU AS YOU SAID I WAS ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION I KNOW THE OF. DEBATES IN BATTLES THAT WE HAD ON THERE ON A LOT OF THINGS RELATED TO. YOUR WORKING PEOPLE. OF BUT IT'S JUST IF THIS IS THE LAST. OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANYTHING I REALLY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE AND NOT HAVING THE LABOR STANDARDS. UP IN THE IN THE BILL AND- A- YOU KNOW. IT IT JUST SEEMS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S NOT APPLICABLE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. READ THAT MR AT PLEASE I WANT TO SEE THOUGH IT HAS SOME REWARD POINTS TO REACT AND. TESTING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE UNDER LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE PROVIDED FOR ANY SUBJECT PROJECT PRODUCTS THAT THAT WILL NOT CHANGE. THIS IS REALLY JUST TO MAKE SURE THIS ADDITIVE LAYER THAT WE HAVE ON THE COASTAL CAMELON AT THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S. REVIEW IS ON THE STREAMLINING ISN'T MIRRORED. RELATIVE TO THE PERMITTING THAT WE SEE UNDER A LOCAL TOURIST PROCESS THESE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MAJORITY LEADER PLEASE. I JUST WANT REPEAT WOODS CENTER DRAWS AND I'M UNCOMFORTABLE OF LABOR STANDARDS IN A DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE I TOLD YOU MY WORK AND I HAVE NEVER BROKEN MY WORD EVEN WHEN I MADE A MISTAKE. I WANTED TO. RICE OF THIS BUSINESS. YOU TELL SOMEBODY IT'S MY OBLIGATION I WAS IN THE OPPRESSION THAT IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF. I HAD TALKED TO THE LABOR FOLKS WHO TOLD ME THAT IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW THAT. WE WERE GOING TO GO FROM A STUDY BILL AND FRIDAY NIGHT TILL NOW. SO I'M UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS TODAY BECAUSE I TOLD YOU I WORK. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT I MAKE NO COMMITMENTS AND TO DO SOME MORE HOMEWORK THAT I WILL VOTE FOR THIS ON THE FLOOR. BUT I WILL NEVER BREAK MY WORD AND I MADE A MISTAKE BECAUSE SOMETHING GOT SCREWED UP IN THE PROCESS. AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE NOTION OF LABOR STANDARDS I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE THAN HOME KEY. PERSONALLY APPLICATION OF THESE LABOR STANDARDS MORE BROADLY SPEAKING. WHICH CREATED SOME PROBLEM AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY SO I JUST YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS WHAT IT IS. IN THE FAST AND FURIOUS OF THE WORLD WHICH WERE IN THE LAST DAYS OF SESSIONS HARD CERTAINLY HAVING A OFF THE FLOOR HEARING LIKE THIS IS CHALLENGING. BUT I WILL NEVER BREAK MY WORD I GAVE IT TO YOU I WILL VOTE TODAY. BUT I BETTER BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN'T TELL% YOU A LITTLE FROM THE FLORIDA KEYS AND WALLMARK. BECAUSE I WAS THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT ISSUE WAS TAKEN. CARE OF. AND OF COURSE IS THAT- IT IS A NEW. ISSUE FOR ME AT THE MOMENT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES THEY HAVE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. OF IN MANY VOICES THAT AWAIT INTO THIS AND- IF IT'S- OKAY WITH THE CHAIR AND I'D BE HAPPY TO. POSSIBLY CLOSE. THIS IS DRESS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT DID YOU HAVE ANY OUTSIDE BEFORE WE CLOSE OUR DRAWS A DEEP. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE SOME REWARD. WE I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING YOU ALL KNOW WELL WE HAVE NO SHORTAGE OF ISSUES TO WORK ON YEARS OF HOUSING BUT PARTICULARLY ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ON. RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE. MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN ASKING ME AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE EXTENDING SOME F THOSE VERY SAME STREAMLINING PROTECTIONS. THAT ARE ALREADY AFFORDED- FROM THE FOR PROFIT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO. TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH THIS BECAUSE WHAT SOMETIMES CAN DO WITH THAT TIME TIME IS MONEY. FROM DEVELOPMENT MAY NOT EVEN WANT TO BE ABLE TO. ENTERTAIN IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW. WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD INTENDING AND WELL INTEGRATED PROJECT INTO A COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING A WORKFORCE HOUSING. IS JUST NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY PENCIL OUT OF THE WRIST THERE WOULD BE TOO GREAT. THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THIS BILL. AND SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF. EQUALLY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO IT THAT WE WOULD. SATISFYING AS WE TRY TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE. MANY OF THE CHALLENGES AND- STATUTES AND ON. AND SUPPORT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA WE WILL DO THAT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TOGETHER AND SO MY COMMITMENT REMAINS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- THROUGH. THE PURPOSE AND THE OUTCOMES OF THIS BILL. IN ALL THE LEGISLATION THAT I WILL BE WORKING ON IN THE AREA OF HOUSING. PRODUCTION GOING FORWARD AS WELL SO- WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE- SPECIAL.
