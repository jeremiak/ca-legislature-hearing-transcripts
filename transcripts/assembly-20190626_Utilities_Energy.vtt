ADEQUATE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:32:09.827 --> 00:32:11.596
IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING.

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:12.764
THE RISK OF TREES AND BRUSH

REDUCE THE CHANCE OF A WILDFIRE.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.764
UNDER CURRENT LAW INVESTOR OWNED

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.966
UTILITIES MUST PROVIDE THE CBC

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:51.469
WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.438

FURTHER UNDER CURRENT LAW THE

EACH WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN.

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:05.216
SB TWO FORTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:06.751
CAL FIRE TO AUDIT EACH

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:08.553
ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:10.355
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK TO

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.823
ENSURE THAT THE UTILITIES

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:13.424

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:18.229
MITIGATION PLAN.

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.364
FINALLY BECAUSE VEGETATION

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.234
MANAGE WORK IS VERY DANGEROUS SB

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.969
TWO FORTY SEVEN ALSO REQUIRES

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:26.104
THAT THE VEGETATION MAYES WORK

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.438
BE PERFORMED.

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.407
BY QUALIFIED LYING CLEARANCE

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:30.975

RECENTLY JUDGE ALSO OVERSEE P.

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:38.316
GENIES PROBATION IN THE SAID

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.017
BRITTLE CASE SAID P. JEANNIE

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.619
HASN'T CUT THE RIGHT TREES AND

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:44.455
MANAGING VEGETATION.

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:50.161

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.063
IN RESPONSE.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.930
P. JEANNIE SAID AND I QUOTE

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.399
THERE'S A LOT OF TREES OUT THERE

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.299
AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL HIGHS ON

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.801
ALL OF THEM.

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.469
MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I IT'S A BIT

00:33:58.536 --> 00:33:59.203
LET'S GET THE ELECTRICAL

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.272
UTILITIES THE EYES THE NEED --

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:02.240
TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE EDUCATION

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:03.908
AND CUT THE RIGHT TREES I

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:05.143
BELIEVE WITH THE AMENDMENTS TAKE

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:06.444
IT IN THE SENATE.

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:09.781
ALL OPPOSITION HAS BEEN REMOVED.

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.783
I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOAT.

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:13.284
WITH ME HERE TODAY ARE

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:14.419
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COALITION

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:20.391
OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES.

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:21.526
I THINK IS THE CHAIR MARK JOSEPH

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.194
ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:24.796
CALIFORNIA TILL THE EMPLOYEES.

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:26.130
THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE CHANCE

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:27.565
OF A FUTURE FIRE BECAUSE UTILITY

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:29.767
FAILED TO TRIM A TREE.

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:32.170
RIGHT NOW THE UTILITY DECIDES

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:34.105
WHAT TREES NEED TO BE TRIMMED.

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:35.473
IT PERFORMS A WORK AND THEN IT

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.074
OUGHT ITS ITS OWN WORK.

00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:37.542
IT'S MOSTLY DONE WITH

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:38.743
CONTRACTORS.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.778
AFTER A FIRE.

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.713
CAL FIRE INVESTIGATES DECIDES

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.248
WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE AND

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:45.516
SOMETIMES THEY FIND THAT THE

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:46.651
FAILURE TO TRIM A TREE THAT

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:48.152
SHOULD'VE BEEN TRIMMED WAS THE

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.487
CAUSE OF THE FIRE.

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:50.555
NO IT'S REALLY NICE TO KNOW

00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:51.956
AFTER THE FACT BUT TO BE MUCH

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:54.058
BETTER IF WE KNEW IT BEFORE THE

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.760
FIRE OCCURRED.

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:56.394
THIS BILL WOULD HAVE CAL FIRE

00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:58.262
AUDIT THE UTILITIES WORK RIGHT

00:34:58.329 --> 00:34:59.931
AWAY BEFORE THE FIRE.

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:00.898
AND TELL THE UTILITY IF IT'S

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:02.300
MISS SOMETHING.

00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:03.768
THEN THE AGILITY HAS A CHANCE TO

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:06.237
FIX THE MISTAKE RIGHT AWAY.

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:07.805
THEN CAL FIRE REPORTS THE

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.740
RESULTS OF ITS AUDIT TO THE

00:35:09.807 --> 00:35:11.309
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.643
THIS WILL CREATE A VERY POWERFUL

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.279
INCENTIVE FOR THE UTILITY TO FIX.

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:16.581
EVERY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:17.648
PROBLEM THAT CALIFORNIA

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:20.184
IDENTIFIES BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.719
AND THAT CAUSES A FIRE.

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:22.587
THERE WILL BE A PAPER TRAIL

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:24.589
SHOWING THE AGILITY WAS WARNED

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.890
AND FAILED TO ACT.

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.091
WE DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:27.859
HAPPEN WE EXPECT THE UTILITY TO

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:30.061
JUMP ON EVERY PROBLEM THE

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:31.762
CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.164
CALIFORNIA AUDITING UTILITY WORK

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:35.600
IS A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM THAN

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.735
SELF AUDITING.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.570
THE BILL DOES NOT INCREASE ANY

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.671
EXPENSE FOR CALIFORNIA --

00:35:40.738 --> 00:35:42.240
BECAUSE CAL FIRE WOULD BE

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.875
REIMBURSED BY THE UTILITY FOR

00:35:43.941 --> 00:35:45.209
ITS AUDITING WORK.

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.944
THE BILL WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:47.745
THE VEGETATION MATTER FOR

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.413
PROCESS AND RESULT IN FEWER

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.883
FIRES CAUSED BY MISTAKES AND

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.384

WORKERS JUST VERY QUICKLY THE

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:37.962
SECOND PORTION OF THE BILL HAS

DOES THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.239
BECAUSE OF THE VAST AMOUNT OF

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:50.174
RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN FOCUSED

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.809

MADE THAT -- THE EXPECTATION

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:52.790
WOULD BE THAT THE PC WOULD BE

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:55.559
WOULD TAKE ANY NOTIFICATION

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:58.529

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.027
TIME MAY COME.

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.395
YEAH DEPENDING UPON THE

YOUR GREAT STEP -- IN.

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:45.476
IN JUST MAKING SURE THAT -- YEAH

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.211
WE'RE NOT ALLOWING THE UTILITIES

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.279
TO SELF CERTIFY.

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:50.915
THAT THEY'VE DONE THE WORK THAT

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:53.784

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.439
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS CALIFORNIA

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:10.074
HAS HAD THE MOST DEADLY AND

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.508
COSTLY FIRES IN THE STATE'S

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:12.709
HISTORY.

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.311
CLIMATE EXPERTS AGREE THAT WE

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:15.846
CAN EXPECT MORE DEVASTATING

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:17.915
EXTREME WILDFIRES FIRES AND

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.983
DROUGHTS ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.418

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:22.986
THAT'S WHY I AM PLEASED TO

FIVE ONE FIVE AND NARROWLY

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.723
FOCUSED BILL THAT WOULD EXPAND

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.692
THE DEFINITION OF HIGH HAZARD

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:33.130
FUEL FOR BIOMASS FACILITIES WITH

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:33.864
BIRAM CONTRACTS.

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.732
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THEN

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:37.201
GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ISSUED AN

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:39.136

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:42.439
ISSUE OF EXPIRING BIOMASS

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.540
CONTRACTS.

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:44.942
AS PART OF THE CONCERN THAT

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:46.477
CALIFORNIA HAD AN ESTIMATED AT

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:48.178
THAT TIME IT WAS ESTIMATED AT A

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:49.646
HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DEAD AND

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:50.647
DYING TREES.

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:52.182
CALIFORNIA PUT TOGETHER A MAP

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.650
COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE HIGH

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:55.652
HAZARD ZONES IDENTIFYING AREAS

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.020
THAT COULD BE IMPACTED AS A

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.123
RESULT OF A DEAD TREE HITTING A

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.724
POWER LINE OR BLOCKING THE ROAD.

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:02.726
THE CPUC RESPONDED BY REQUIRING

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.328
THE UTILITIES TO PROCURE FIFTY

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:06.930
MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY.

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.565
THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ACTED IN

00:46:08.632 --> 00:46:10.901
PAST EIGHT FIFTY NINE SB EIGHT

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:11.435
FIFTY NINE WHICH REQUIRED

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:12.669
ANOTHER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:14.505
FIVE MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:15.873
TO BE PROCURED.

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:18.075
IN ALL THERE ARE SEVEN CONTRACTS

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.510
SIGNED AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.678
MANDATES AND THEY REFERRED TO AS

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:23.213
BIO RAM CONTRACTS.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.348
ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.316
REQUIRED TO GET IS A SPECIFIED

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.018
AMOUNT OF FUEL FROM HIGH HAZARD

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:28.685
ZONES.

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:30.053
HOWEVER THE UNINTENDED

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.022
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS REQUIREMENT

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:33.657
IS THAT FOREST WASTE.

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:35.359
THAT IS DEEMED TO BE FROM A HIGH

00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:37.828
HAZARD ZONE NOW COST MORE THAN

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:40.531
FOREST WAIT WASTE THAT COULD

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:41.465
START A WILDFIRE.

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:42.933
SOME OF THESE FACILITIES PAY A

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.801
PENALTY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:46.403
THE REQUIREMENT OF HIGH HAZARD

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.472
ZONE FUEL WHICH WAS AN ARBITRARY

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.308
TARGET SET AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR.

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.911
WE HAVE WE NOW KNOW WE HAVE A

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:54.978
HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.680
DEAD OR DYING TREES.

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.048
AND WE HAVE AN UNHEALTHY AND

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.950
OVERSTOCK FOREST WITH EXCESS

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:02.219
FUEL A WILDFIRE CATASTROPHE IN

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:03.587
WAITING.

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.222
THE NAPA COUNTY WILDFIRES DID

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:07.024
NOT CONTAIN THESE HIGH HAZARD

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.593
ZONES AND NEITHER DID PARADISE.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.094
RATHER THAN WAIT AND TELL A

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:12.963
DEVASTATING WILDFIRE DESTROYS A

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.431
COMMUNITY BEFORE REMOVING

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.766
REMOVING THE FUEL.

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:16.700
WE WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT IN

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:17.968
FRONT OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.137
AND TRY TO PREVENT THE NEXT

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:21.271
MAJOR WILDFIRE.

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.340
SB FIVE ONE FIVE EXPAND THE

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.775
DEFINITION OF HIGH HAZARD ZONE

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:27.177
FUEL TO INCLUDE THE AREAS WITHIN

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:30.247
A WILDFIRE SINCE TWENTY TWELVE

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:31.515
WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:33.116
CAL FIRE HAS ANNOUNCED EARLIER

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.151
THIS YEAR.

HAZARD HAZARD ZONES.

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:40.857
THIS BILL IS A SMALL BUT

00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:42.659
IMPORTANT STEP TO IMPROVE THE

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.194
CONDITIONS IN OUR FORESTS.

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:45.629
AND HELP PROTECT COMMUNITIES

00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.364
FROM WILDFIRES WHERE THERE IS

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.065
EXCESS FUEL.

00:57:58.107 --> 00:57:59.843
COMMUNITY FRANKLY THE WAY IT'S

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.611
BEING DISPOSED OF RIGHT NOW IS

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:04.280
TO LET IT BIO DEGRADE WHICH IS --

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:07.750
EMITTING A LOT OF CARBON -- THE

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:10.019
DECOMPOSITION RELEASES CARBON

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:12.388
AND AND IS NOT GOOD BUT BUT EVEN

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:14.224
MORE DANGEROUS IS THAT BECAUSE

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.693
IT IS FUEL IF IT LIGHTS UP.

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:18.528
IT -- THE POLLUTION THAT'S

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:20.897
CREATED BY THE BURNING MATERIAL

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.900
IS -- EVEN WORSE AT IT APART

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.068
FROMTHE FACT THAT WOULD THEN

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:26.669
EVERYBODY BREATHE BREATHE IT IN

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:28.071
RIGHT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:30.440
MANY OF OUR OUR REGIONS IS THAT --

00:58:30.506 --> 00:58:32.475
IN PARTICULAR AGRICULTURAL WASTE

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:34.143
IS BURNT IT'S JUST BURNED IN THE

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.246
FEEL THERE'S NO PLACE TO PUT IT

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:39.349
AND THERE'S IT'S IT YOU'RE NOT

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:41.017
GENERATING ANY ENERGY.

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:42.385
WHEN YOU'RE BURNING WASTE IN A

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:43.753
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN AGRICULTURAL

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.022
FIELDS YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE IT

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:47.724
TO A BIO MASS FACILITY?

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.292
BURN IT CLEANLY.

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.527
AND AND AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN IT

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:53.263
RETROFITTED WITH THE HIGHEST

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:56.032
LEVEL OF OF THEIR THEIR

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.901
SCRUBBERS THAT THAT CLEAN THAT

00:58:57.967 --> 00:59:02.472
THE BY PRODUCT AND SO -- THIS

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:03.306
WILL NOT ALLOW.

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:04.941
CHEAPER MATERIAL.

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:07.443
THAT IS NOT A DANGER TO THE

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.812
COMMUNITY TO BE UTILIZED THIS IS

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.414
THIS IS MATERIAL THAT IS

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:14.017
CREATING A HUGE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:16.286
CRISIS AND AND WE'VE VERY

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:17.921
CAREFULLY THAT THE THE BILL WAS

00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:19.656
ACTUALLY BIGGER WE THINK IT

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:21.257
SHOULD BE BAKER -- WE'VE

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:23.192
NARROWLY TAILORED IT AT THE

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.495
REQUEST OF SENATE COMMITTEES --

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:27.030
TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE HIGHEST

00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:29.232
NEED AREA BUT I WOULD NOT BE

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:30.500
SURPRISED IF THE REPORT THAT

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:32.235
COMES OUT FROM THE C. P. U. C.

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:33.169
SAYS WE NEED TO BROADEN IT A

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:35.638
LITTLE BIT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:39.242
ON DOES NOT A VERY SPECIFIC

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.643
LEGAL TERM BUT WE HAVE A TON OF

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.078
MATERIAL OUT THERE THAT NEEDS TO

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:44.447
BE DISPOSED OF AND THE ONLY WAY

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.082
WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF IT IS IF

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:48.351
WE CAN WE WE HAVE A USE -- AND

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.286
WE CAN WE CAN MOVE IT -- QUICKLY

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:51.921
AND USE AND USE IT TO CREATE

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:53.156
ENERGY.

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:55.191
SO I I I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.693
WITH WITH WITH THAT PREMISE IN

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.428
THAT BUT BUT LET ME ALSO SAY

00:59:58.494 --> 01:00:00.596
THAT I HAD EARLY CONVERSATION

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.732
WHEN I GOT TO THE ASSEMBLY --

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.801
TWO YEARS AGO AND I ASKED THE

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.602
SIERRA CLUB WHAT'S YOUR SOLUTION

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:07.770
TO THE HUNDRED AND TWO DEAD OR

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.739
DYING TREES AND BASICALLY WHAT

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:10.807
THEY TELL ME IS LEAVE IT.

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.475
LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND AND I WAS

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:15.578
APPALLED BECAUSE DECOMPOSITION

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:18.815
IS NOT THE SOLUTION -- FOR FOR

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.717
THIS THIS MATERIAL AND WE'VE

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:23.920
SEEN THAT WITH THE THE

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:25.355
CHALLENGES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.190
THAT ARE FIRES ARE BURNING

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.558
HOTTER THEY'RE THEY'RE MOVING A

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:29.492
LOT FASTER.

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:32.762
AND THIS MATERIAL LAYING AROUND

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:36.232
OR AND A LOT OF IT IS IS.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.834
IT IT'S PEOPLE REALLY DO NEED TO

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.102
GO UP INTO THE HIGH SIERRAS AND

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.403
SEE THE DEAD TREES UP THERE IT'S

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.703
APPALLING.

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.005
WE NEED TO WE NEED TO TAKE THOSE

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:43.840
TREES OUT WE NEED TO GET RID OF

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.141
THEM AND WE NEED TO RE PLANNING

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.009
ON THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS IF

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:48.044
YOU'VE GOT A A WAY TO BE ABLE TO

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.545
UTILIZE THE FUEL THAT CREATES.

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.748
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO I

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.783
I DISAGREE WITH THAT THERE THERE

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:54.617
IS STATEMENT OKAY.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.052
I MEAN THAT THAT MAY BE THE

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.353
BOTTOM LINE THE THAT.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.955
TO YOU DO YOU DISAGREE WITH WITH

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:01.591

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:07.096
WITH WITH THE TOUR THEREFORE SHE

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:09.599
ASSOCIATION THAT WAS LED BY

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:14.537
ASSEMBLYMEMBER -- RECENTLY AND

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:15.605
IN A WHILE I AGREE COMPLETE WITH

YOU'RE SAYING IT JUST MAKES

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.508
COMMON SENSE THAT IF YOU WANT TO

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.108
FIGHT THE THE WITH THE WILD

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.043
FIRES.

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:23.112
WE NEED TO CLEAR OUT THE FUEL

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.013
ARM AND AND AND WE NEED

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.313

TO PROVIDE THE YOU KNOW MARKET

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:28.818
AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO A TO

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.253
DECLARE THAT FUEL.

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:33.089
IT JUST BOTHERS ME THAT -- YOU

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:33.289

YOU KNOW I AND AGAIN I'M QUOTING

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.660
FROM THE SIERRA CLUB AND AND A

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.062

CLAIMING THAT THAT THE THE

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:44.100
PROGRAM THE BIRAM PROGRAM HAS

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.468
JUST IS NOT FILLED ITS.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.736
ITS PURPOSE OF HELPING THE

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.504
REMOVING UTILIZE TREES THAT POSE

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:52.575
HAZARDS -- SO YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:56.045
A MAYBE I NEED TO HAVE I I WISH

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.780

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:11.227
LETTER.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.695
IT SAYS -- WELL WE SHOULD ONLY

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.263
BE WORRIED ABOUT TREES THAT ARE

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.632
NEAR HOMES HAVEN'T THEY SEEN

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:18.201
PARADISE PARADISE.

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:21.704
WHEN UP WHEN MILES AWAY A FIRE

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.873
STARTED AND THEN IT WASN'T SO

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.842
MUCH THAT THE FIRE WENT THROUGH

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:28.244
PARADISE IT'S THAT THE BURNING

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.480
EMBERS WERE BLOWN BY HUNDRED

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.248
MILE AN HOUR WINDS?

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:34.016
I SHOULD NEVER BEEN BELT.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:34.550
FRANKLY IT SHOULD NEVER BE

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:36.853
REBUILT.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.421
FROM THE EIGHTIES THEY KNEW THAT

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:39.755
WAS GOING TO BE DISASTER BUT AT

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.157
ANY RATE.

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.525
THAT'S A SEPARATE SUBJECT THE

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.093
POINT IS THE FIRE DOESN'T EVEN

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.528
HAVE TO BE NEAR YOUR HOUSE TO

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.629
BURN IT DOWN.

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.131
THE EMBERS COMING IN THESE HIGH

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:50.700
WINDS CAN BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:52.368
YOU CAN CLEAR EVERY TREE AND IN

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.403
FACT IF YOU GO THROUGH PARADISE

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.372
THEIR PLACES WHERE THE TREES ARE

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.807
THERE BUT THE HOUSES BURNED DOWN.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:00.776
SO -- THIS LETTER IS -- IT

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:04.947
MISSES THE POINT.

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.049
OTHER THAN THAT IS JUST FINE I

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:10.386
HAVE ONE QUESTION -- I DO HAVE

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.622
ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:12.922
[inaudible]

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:13.990

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.560
WENT ON TO THE SENATE.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.829
HE WAS ALWAYS PRESSING US TO DO

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:21.330
MORE OF THIS IN THE BILL SEMINAR

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.166
THAT WOULD GET OUT OF HERE BUT

01:03:23.232 --> 01:03:25.835
THEY DIE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.070
THANK GOD WE'VE.

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:28.804
WELL WE DIDN'T LISTEN TO HIM

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.039
SOON ENOUGH BUT AT LEAST WE'RE

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.007
DOING IT NOW.

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:33.309
MY CONCERN IS THOUGH A LOT OF

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:34.944
THESE PLANTS HAVE SHUT DOWN.

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:39.749
THE CCA'S ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING --

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:40.983

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.921
ELECTRICITY AND AND P. GENIE IS

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:45.721
MAYBE.

THEY ALWAYS USED TO BE THE ONE

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.824
OF CONTRACTED BUT THEY'VE LOST

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:50.359

BUT I THINK THAT THESE ARE

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:21.877
EXTRAORDINARY TIMES SO WE DO

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:24.313
HAVE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING BEYOND

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.481
WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT BEFORE.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:28.351

MAKING DECISIONS WE CANNOT?

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.832
WE CANNOT JUST THINK OF ONE AREA

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:43.733

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:07.876
BECAUSE OF THE INTERMITTENT HR

CCA WE OPPOSE.

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:38.367
I WANTED TO FIRST ACTUALLY

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:40.335
APOLOGIZED TO SENATOR BRADFORD

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:43.005
WE THE BILL WAS SUBSTANTIALLY

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.840
IMPROVED AND SENATE ENERGY WITH

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:45.974
AMENDMENTS.

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.643
AND THERE WAS A LITTLE CONFUSION

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:48.677
OR MISUNDERSTANDING NOBODY'S

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:51.280
FAULT -- ABOUT ONE PROVISION

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:52.881
WHICH IS THE PROVISION LEFT THAT

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:53.715
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.284
TODAY AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.919
OUT OF THE BILL AND SO WE HAD

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:58.387
REMOVED OPPOSITION THAT

01:15:58.453 --> 01:15:59.621
COMMITTEE SO I'M SORRY FOR THE

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:04.126
MISUNDERSTANDING -- SO WE HAVE

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:04.693
TWO CONCERNS FIRST THE ONE I

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.762
JUST REFERENCE WHICH IS ABOUT

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.297
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:10.432
THAT INSERTS THE WORD IN FORCE

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:11.767
WHICH DOESN'T EXISTING CURRENT

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:14.136
LAW IN TERMS OF THE CPC'S

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:15.604
AUTHORITY.

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.873
OVER THE I. R. P. WE WE THINK

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.642
THAT -- THAT'S AN EXPANSION OF

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.279
THE CDC'S SPECIFIC CUT -- WRITES

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.915
A OUR POWER AND THE I. R. P. IS

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.216
SUPPOSED TO BE A PLANNING

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:30.218
DOCUMENT IT'S NOT A ROCK SOLID

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.920
PROCUREMENT PLAN THEY'RE

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.822
SUPPOSED TO BE FLEXIBILITY. TEN

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:34.556
TWELVE YEARS OUT THE

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.491
CIRCUMSTANCES COULD BE DIFFERENT

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:37.125
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LOCKED IN

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:38.126
THAT COULD.

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.895
CAUSE RATES TO GO UP AND OTHER

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:43.598
PROBLEMS SO -- SO WE THINK THAT

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:45.000
BY INSERTING THE WORD AND FORCE

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:48.870
IT GIVES A CBC THE ABILITY. TO

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.306
NULLIFY CONTRACTS AND SO ON AND

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:52.741
THAT'S AN ABILITY THAT WE DON'T

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:54.443
THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE WITH

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.411
REGARD TO CCA'S -- THE SECOND

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:58.814
REASON OUR SECOND CONCERN.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.382
WHICH I WHICH I THINK IS A VERY

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:01.516
IMPORTANT CONCERN IS THE

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.818
FOLLOWING.

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:05.787
SB THREE FIFTY ESTABLISHED THIS

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:08.357
FIRST OF A KIND STATEWIDE IRP

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:11.393
PROCESS THAT BILL IS PASSED IN

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.294
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WAS.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.229
VERY INTENSELY NEGOTIATED

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.198
INCLUDING BY THE BY THE CCA

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.233
WORLD -- IT BECAME EFFECTIVE LAW

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.802
OBVIOUSLY ON JANUARY ONE SIXTEEN

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:23.238
WORD NOW IN THE MIDST ROUGHLY

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.773
HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.275
STATEWIDE IRP PROCESS EVER AT

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:29.044
THE CPUC.

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:30.679
THIS IS AKIN TO BEING IN THE MET

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:31.880
IN THE MIDDLE OF PENDING

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:34.816
LITIGATION WITH A BILL COMING TO

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:37.786
THE LEGISLATURE. TO IMPACT THE

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.521
SUBJECT OF THE LITIGATION AND

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:41.089
GENERALLY AS YOU KNOW THE

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.257
LEGISLATURE LIKES TO HOLD OFF TO

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.859
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:45.927
LEGISLATURE WITH THE LITIGATION.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.462
WE THINK THAT'S THE SITUATION

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:50.599
HERE -- WE EXPECT A AS I

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.300
MENTIONED WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:54.136
THROUGH THIS EXISTING PROCEEDING

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:55.404
BASED ON A STATUTE THAT WENT

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:56.972
INTO LAW A FEW YEARS AGO.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:58.707
WE EXPECT THE FINAL A PROPOSED

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:04.279
FINAL ORDER IN LATE TWENTY

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.481
TWENTY OR EARLY TO TWENTY ONE

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:07.182
AND A FINAL ORDER CAN BE AS

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.183
EARLY AS THIRTY DAYS AFTER THAT

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:08.483
FOR LATER.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.384
SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.353
SHOULD WAIT FOR THIS FIRST I OUR

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.121
P. BASED ON THE EXISTING LAW TO

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.289
BE COMPLETED.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.792
I REPEAT PROCESS AND THEN BRING

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.627
IN THE CPC TO AN INFORMATIONAL

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:19.761
HEARING BRING AND OTHER

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.863
STAKEHOLDERS LET'S SEE WHAT WAS

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:22.998
RIGHT AND WRONG IF THEY'RE AND

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.599
CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE.

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.168

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:19.647
CPC ON THESE ISSUES CHANGES THE

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:21.850
AUTHORITY OVER THE CCA'S WHICH

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.451
YOU KNOW ARE AFTER ALL

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:24.986
INDEPENDENT BROKERS.

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:26.654
AND BUT WE AGREED BUT WE

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:28.690

THIS CENTRAL BODY TAKING A LOOK.

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:33.127
SO THE LANGUAGE WE WE PROPOSE

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:34.696
ACCORDING TO OUR ATTORNEYS.

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.431

OUR PIECE FROM A PLANNING

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.917
DOCUMENT TO PROCUREMENT MANDATES.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.318

MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THAT'S

01:25:58.753 --> 01:25:59.821
A MAJOR CONCERN THEY ARE

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:00.889
SUPPOSED TO BE PLANNING

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.690
DOCUMENTS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:04.158
IN CEMENT.

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:07.395
AND AND IN FACT -- ALONG THOSE

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:08.763
LINES I MEAN I I I NOTED THAT

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.298
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TALKED

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:11.633
ABOUT HOW [inaudible]

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:15.637
THE THE ENERGY PROCUREMENT --

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:19.073
TODAY -- ALL IS -- IS IS VASTLY

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.042
DIFFERENT FROM THE FROM DAY FROM

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.477
THE GENERATION THAT WE RELIED ON

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:24.746
A DECADE AGO AND SO THAT WOULD

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:26.381
HIGHLIGHT YOUR CONCERN ABOUT.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:29.050
LOCKING OURSELVES INTO THESE

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.952
LONG TERM KIND.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:31.853
TRAXXAS ACCURATE LOCKING IT

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.989
LOCKING US INTO -- ONE PLANNING

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.958
CONVERTING A PLANNING DOCUMENT

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.426
TO A ROCK SOLID YOU KNOW

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:39.761
DOCUMENT THAT THAT HAS NO

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:41.162
FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD BE THE

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:42.130
CONCERNED YES.

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:44.732
I I'D LIKE TO DID TURN -- TO THE

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:47.302
ADDISON REPRESENTATIVE -- WE WE

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:48.236
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE I. R.

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:49.304
P. SHOULD BE.

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.072
YOU KNOW HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:54.442
TO ALLOW FOR FOR THE THAT THE

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:58.346
CHANGING -- ENERGY TECHNOLOGY.

01:26:58.413 --> 01:26:59.547
YES THERE ARE PEAS ACTUALLY DO

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.783
PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.418
FLEXIBILITY AND GIVES A LITTLE

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:04.986
BIT OF A A CONFUSION HERE --

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:08.156
UTILITY -- ARE PEAS -- WITH --

01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:08.923
AND LONG TERM RETIREMENT PLANS

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.458
HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:11.859
FLEXIBILITY IN THEM -- WHAT THE

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:13.728
CQC DOES IS IT SETS STANDARDS

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.096
THAT THE UTILITY HAS TO ME IN

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:17.966
THIS CASE -- UNDER A SB ONE

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.033
FIFTY FIVE THE EXPECTATION WOULD

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.336
BE THAT THE CPC WOULD APPROVE A

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:24.105
A RANGE OF ATTRIBUTES THAT EACH

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.307
LSE NEEDS TO MEET AND LEAVE TO

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:27.008
EACH LOC.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.776
ARE HOW TO BEST DETERMINE TO

01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:30.845
MEET THOSE ATTRIBUTES -- THIS IS

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:33.014
A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- JUST

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.882
THIS LAST THURSDAY -- THE CPC

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:36.618
ISSUED A RULING IDENTIFYING THAT

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:38.086
THERE'S AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:39.520
MEGAWATTS OF OF CAPACITY

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:41.856
SHORTFALL -- ANTICIPATED IN TWO

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:45.226
YEARS BY THE SUMMER OF TWENTY

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:45.827
TWENTY ONE EDISON BUT WORKING

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:46.628
WITH COMMISSION STAFF ON THAT

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:47.795
OUR OWN ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:49.897
THE SHORTFALL MAYBE AS MUCH AS

01:27:49.964 --> 01:27:50.598
SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:51.399
MEGAWATTS. TO PUT THAT IN

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:54.369
CONTEXT THAT'S ABOUT 15% OF THE

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.137
TOTAL DEMAND AT PEAK -- IT'S

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:57.238
HAPPENING BECAUSE OUR WANTS TO

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.539
COOLEY FACILITIES ARE RETIRING

01:27:58.606 --> 01:28:00.375
WHICH THEY SHOULD -- IT'S

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.043
HAPPENING BECAUSE THE NET PEAK

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.578
ON THE SYSTEM IS MOVING FROM THE

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:05.647
MIDDLE OF SUMMER TO SEPTEMBER.

01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:06.981
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:08.483
SUNSHINE IN SEPTEMBER RIGHT THE

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:09.951
SUN GOES DOWN SOONER SO THE

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:11.519
SOLAR -- PROJECTS THAT WE'VE

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.887
BEEN INVESTING IN ARE NOT THAT

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.956
EFFECTIVE IN SEPTEMBER OF THE

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:15.690
WIND DOESN'T BLOW THAT MUCH

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:16.958
SEPTEMBER BASICALLY YOU GET

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.893
ABOUT 15% OF THE OUTPUT OF THE

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.461
SOLAR AND WIND PROJECT IN

01:28:20.528 --> 01:28:21.496
SEPTEMBER SO.

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:22.563
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.399
NEXT TWO YEARS IF WE DON'T WANT

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:25.566
TO HELP OUR LIABILITY SITUATION

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:26.868
LIKE WE DID DURING THE ENERGY

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.503
CRISIS I'M HAPPY TO SHARE.

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:30.371
WITH FOLKS HOW THAT CAME AMOUNT

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:33.474
OF THAT WE HAVE ENFORCEMENT OF

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:35.343
ALL L. THIS SEASON MEETING THEIR

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:37.178
FAIR SHARE OF THE RELIABILITY

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:38.680
AND CLEAN ENERGY REQUIREMENTS.

01:28:38.746 --> 01:28:40.615
NOBODY'S GONNA TELL THE CCA WHAT

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.617
SPECIFIC PROJECT TO BUY OR BUILD

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:43.584
NO ONE'S GOING TO NULLIFY

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:45.153
SOMEONE'S CONTRACT WHAT THEY

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:46.454
WILL SAY IS YOU NEED X. Y. Z.

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:48.256

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:49.157
DONE THAT.

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:50.558
AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SAYING

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.559
THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:54.529
BECAUSE UNDER UNDER CURRENT LAW.

01:28:54.595 --> 01:29:01.969

R. I. R. PEAS.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.247
AT EDISON BELIEVES THAT THERE

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:14.749
ACTUALLY IS SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY

WHOLE STATE VULNERABLE AND WILL

AND WE COME BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.489
BECAUSE WE MAKE A MAJOR MISTAKE

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:03.257
HERE WE LET LEGISLATORS WITH NO

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:04.892
EXPERIENCE AND POLICY -- AND

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:09.530
POWER IN GENERATION.

MAYBE WITH THIS EXCEPTION.

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:12.500
VERY FEW MAKE ENERGY POLICY HERE

FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:14.769
THAT'S WHY AS STATED WE DON'T

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.370
LAST THING WE WANTED TO LET OUR

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:16.838
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:17.605
RESPONSIBLE [inaudible]

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:18.973
FOR I MEAN.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.509
THAT WE DON'T.

SO WE NEED TO BE UC'S OVERSEE S.

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:24.879
SITE WE NEED TO SEE YOU SEE WE

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.414
NEED THOSE FOLKS WHO.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:29.016
ARE PAID TO DO THIS.

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:31.185
AND EXPERIENCE TO DO IT MR WHAT

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:32.420
SHOULD.

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:33.354
I WOULD JUST ADD MISTER.

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:34.422
CHAIRMAN I THINK THE THE THE

01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:35.056
BEST ARGUMENT FOR THE NEED OF

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:36.591
THIS BILL WAS MADE BY THE

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:37.692
OPPOSITION.

01:31:37.758 --> 01:31:39.794
IN THAT THE FIRST DIRE P. REPORT

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:42.797
CAME BACK AND FOUND DEFICIENCIES.

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:43.764
WE NEED TO PROTECT AGAINST A

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:47.468
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE.

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:49.670

RESPONSIBILITY TO THE EXTREME.

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:56.377
IF THE PC DOESN'T HAVE.

01:31:56.444 --> 01:31:58.579
THE ABILITY TO GO IN AND FORCED
