GOOD MORNING. I DON'T HAVE. LIKE AND SHARE YEAH. I'LL SPARE US ALL THE GAVEL TODAY A GOOD MORNING I THINK EVERYONE FOR COMING FOR JOINING US TODAY TO DISCUSS THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS. FOR CALIFORNIA. IT SAID OF GOING OVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACTS WILL BE MAINLY FOCUSING TODAY'S BRIEFING ON CHANGES. TO THE FEDERAL PERSONAL INCOME TAX SPECIFICALLY WILL BE DISCUSSING ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN TO DESK DEDUCTIONS PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS AND A CAP ON ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. AND I COULD GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE BETTER SUITED TO EDUCATE ALL OF US ON THIS MATTER. SO WITH THAT WHO REALLY STARTED. OKAY BUT THAT WE HAVE JOINING WITH US TODAY IS JUSTIN GROSSI FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL BE PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF FEDERAL TAX. THANK YOU FOR COMING PAY GOOD MORNING I'M JUSTIN GROSSLY FROM THE LA JOH IN SO BRIEFLY I ONCE WANT TO GO OVER SOME OF THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL TAX BILL THE RECENTLY PASSED. SO IF YOU FLIP TO PAGE ONE AND. THE ESTIMATED COST OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS COMBINED IS ABOUT A TRILLION AND A HALF NOW IT'S IT'S NOT SORT OF EVENLY. A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION A YEAR BECAUSEIN SOME PROVISIONS PHASE IN SOME PHASE OUT SO IT'S KIND OF UNEVEN. BUT IS OVERALL IT'S EXPECTED COSTS ABOUT TRILLION HAVE. THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS ARE EXPECTED TO COST ABOUT ONE POINT ONE TRILLION. THE CORPORATE TAX PROVISIONS THAT DEAL WITH. DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES OUR EXPECTED TO COST ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED. BILLION. AND THAT PROVISIONS OF SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH THE OVERSEAS INCOME OF U. S. CORPORATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO RAISE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED BILLION. OKAY SO THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS. THE EFFECTIVE DATES. ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THAT TAX BILL IS ALREADY IN EFFECT. THERE'S A HANDFUL OF PROVISIONS THAT HAVEN'T YET THAT'S WHICH WE'LL GET TO LATER BUT. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IS ALREADY YOU KNOW. IN PLACE. NOW. ALMOST ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS GO AWAY AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE TAX YEAR. SO. THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL THAT AREN'T THAT WE'LL GET TO LATER BUT. BASICALLY ALMOST ANYTHING THAT DEALS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX TO SUNSET AFTER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE. IN. MAYBE THEY'LL BE EXTENDED OR MAYBE THEY WON'T. MAYBE SOME OF THEM WILL BE EXTENDED AND SOME OF THEM WON'T AS WE SAW WITH THE OF. THE BUSH TAX CUTS THAT WERE A. PASSED I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO IN SUNSET IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I MEAN THAT. CONGRESSMAN PRESENT SORT OF. PICKS IT PICKED AND CHOSE WHICH ONES THEY WANTED TO KEEP AND WHICH ONES THEY DIDN'T MAYBE WE'LL SEE THE SAME THING AFTER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE WOULD HAVE TO STAY TUNED. THE CORPORATE PROVISIONS IN CONTRAST ALMOST ALL OF THEIR PERMANENT. AND WE'LL GET TO THE EXPENSING A LITTLE BIT LATER. THE FLIP NOW TO PAGE THREE. OKAY THE HANDOUTS SAYS KEY INDIVIDUAL PROVISIONS FOR NON ITEMIZE HERS. MOST OF THESE ALSO APPLIED ITEMIZE THERE'S. NOW ONE THING THE BILL DID IS ELIMINATED THE PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE IN THE CURRENT IN THE. THE OLD TAX CODE WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A PERSON THOSE ARE GOING THE WAY NOW. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT IS TO RAISE THE STANDARD DEDUCTION. THEY THEY. THE HANDOUT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS FOR JOINT RETURNS. BUT THE STANDARD DEDUCTION WAS ALSO NEARLY DOUBLED FOR. SINGLE FILERS AND FOR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD FILERS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE RATES ARE A LITTLE BIT LOWER ACROSS THE BOARD. WE DON'T SHOW THE TABLE HERE BUT IN GENERAL THEY'RE A BIT LOWER. ANOTHER THING THEY DID TO COMPENSATE PEOPLE FOR ELIMINATING THE PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS WAS. TO INCREASE THE CHILD CREDITS UNDER THE OLD LAW. YOU CAN CLAIM A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY A YOUNG DEPENDENT YOU HAVE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. THAT DOUBLES THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ANOTHER DIFFERENCE. ANOTHER CHANGE THEY MADE. WAS IT UNDER THE OLD LOT NONE OF IT WAS REFUNDABLE MEANING THAT YOU CAN NOT USE. CHILD CREDIT TO REDUCE YOUR LIABILITY BELOW ZERO. NOW IT IS REFUNDABLE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT SO EVEN IF YOUR LIABILITY IS BELOW. THE AMOUNT OF YOUR CHILD CREDIT YOU CAN ACTUALLY. YOU STILL CLAIM THE AMOUNT OF THE CHILD CREDIT IN THE. INSTEAD OF HAVING POSITIVE Y. BILL YOU HAVE NEGATIVE LIABILITY IS SOME TAXPAYERS CURRENTLY DO ESPECIALLY IF THEY TAKE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. SO THAT'S HOW THE NEW CHILD CREDIT WOULD WORK. IF YOU'D FLIP NOW TO PAGE FOUR. THIS SHOWS A BRIEF EXAMPLE OF HOW. HOW IS SAMPLE HOUSEHOLD WOULD BE AFFECTED? UNDER THE NEW LAW COMPARED TO THE OLD LAW. SO THIS IS THE HOUSEHOLD WITH TWO ADULTS TWO KIDS UNDER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INCOME. UNDER THE OLD LAW THE WE GET FOR PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS YA ONE FOR EACH ADULT AND THEN ONE FOR EACH KID. SO THAT WOULD REDUCE THEIR INCOME BY SIXTEEN POINT TWO K.. THOUSAND THIS SIXTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED. THEY WERE ASSUMING THEY'RE NOT ITEMIZING THEY WOULD ALSO TAKE THE STANDARD DEDUCTION WHICH FOR A JOINT RETURN UNDER THE OLD LAW WAS TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED. TO PUT THOSE TOGETHER TAXABLE INCOME GOES FROM SEVENTY FIVE DOWN TO FORTY SIX ONE. NOTING THE NEW LAW THE PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS ARE GONE BUT THE STANDARD DEDUCTIONS A LOT BIGGER. SO TAXABLE INCOME FALLS TO FIFTY ONE THOUSAND OKAY SO TAXABLE INCOME HAS GONE UP UNDER THE NEW LAW BUT. REMEMBER THE RATES ARE ALSO GENERALLY A LITTLE BIT LOWER ACROSS THE BOARD. SO EVEN WITH THE HIGHER TAXABLE INCOME. THEY END UP WITH A LOWER BASED TAX BEFORE THEY CLAIM THEIR CREDITS AND IT DROPS A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. NOW REMEMBER THOUGH. THE CHILD CREDITS HAVE DOUBLED FROM A THOUSAND DOLLARS A KID TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A KID. SO STEM CLAIMING TWO THOUSAND CHILD CREDITS THEY CAN NOW CLAIM FOUR THOUSAND. SO OVERALL THEIR TAX THEIR FEDERAL INCOME TAX BILL. DROPS FROM A LITTLE UNDER FOUR THOUSAND TO ABOUT. SEVENTEEN HUNDRED IN SHADE YOUR A CHANGE A LITTLE OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. NOW ARM. OBVIOUSLY FOR OTHER HOUSEHOLDS A CHANGE OF THE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THEIR INCOME HOW MANY. DID DEPENDENCE THEY HAVE AND WHETHER THEY ITEMIZE OR DON'T ITEMIZE. SO HE FLIPPED A PAGE FIVE. IT'LL SHOW SOME PROVISIONS THAT APPLY ONLY TO ITEMIZE IS BUT NOT TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T ITEMIZE. AS YOU KNOW THE CHAIR MENTIONED EARLIER THIS STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION HAS BEEN PARED BACK. UNDER THE OLD LAW. YOU CAN DEDUCT YOUR PROPERTY TAX IT EITHER YOUR INCOME TAX YOUR SALES TAX WHICHEVER ONES HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST EVERYONE WHO TOOK THIS DEDUCTION DEDUCTED THEIR INCOME TAXES OPPOSED THEIR SALES TAX. ANYWAY. THAT HAS THAT SET UP HIS NOT CHANGE WHICH CHANGED IS THAT. UNDER THE OLD LAW YOU CAN DEDUCT AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW. THE TAXES YOU OWED UNDER THE NEW LAW YOU CANNOT DEDUCT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND SO. THAT'S GOING TO BUY IT A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY ALSO IN MADE SOME CHANGES TO THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION UNDER THE OLD LAW. IT WAS LIMITED TO MORTGAGE DEBT UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU'RE MORTGAGE WAS OVER A MILLION. IT'S REDUCE PROPORTIONATELY BY YOU KNOW THE MOUTH WAS OVER FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A TWO MILLION DOLLAR MORTGAGE YOU CAN DEDUCT HALF OF YOUR MORTGAGE INTEREST. KATE THAT BASIC SET UP IS THE SAME EXCEPT THAT THE LIMIT NOW DROPS FROM A MILLION TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. SO IF YOU'RE MORTGAGE IS A MILLION AND A HALF THEN YOU CAN TO DOT HACK YOUR MORTGAGE INTEREST. ANOTHER CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IS THAT YOU CAN NOT WE CAN NO LONGER. IN DOT THE MORTGAGE INTEREST ON A HOME EQUITY LOAN. OKAY. SO IF YOU FLIP NOW TO PAGE SIX THERE ARE SOME OTHER. PROVISIONS THAT. EFFECT. INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX PAYERS MOST OF THEM DON'T APPLY TO EVERYONE BUT SOME OF THEM DO. THE CHANGE OF THRESHOLD THAT THEY USED TO CALCULATE WHETHER YOU NEED. PART OF THE CHANGE A THRESHOLD OF INCOME. FOR PEOPLE THE DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE TO USE THE ALTAR. HOW THROUGH THE MINIMUM TAX OR NOT? BECAUSE IF YOUR INCOME WAS BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THE CALCULATION. WHAT THEY DID IS THEY TOOK THAT LEVEL? IN THEY RAISED IT SO FEWER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HIT BY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX. ALSO. THERE ISN'T A NEW TWENTY PERCENT DEDUCTION FOR SOME TYPES OF BUSINESS INCOME THAT SOME. NOT CORPORATE INCOME BUT BUSINESS INCOME THAT'S PAID UNDER THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX WHICH IS TYPICALLY THINGS LIKE PARTNERSHIP FOR PROPRIETORS INCOME. THE WAY THEY SET IT UP IS THEY WANTED TO APPLY MOSTLY TO PARTNERSHIPS AS OPPOSED TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE SOLE PROPRIETORS. BUT THE WAY THEY A CALCULATE THE OF. THAT NEW DEDUCTION THERE'S. A FAIR AMOUNT OF GRAY AREA AND SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR HOW THAT'S GONNA SHAKE OUT. ANYWAY. ANOTHER THING THE BILL DOES IS REALLY REPEALS THE MANDATE THAT INDIVIDUALS BUY HEALTH INSURANCE NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT IS NOT IN EFFECT YET THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T GOING TO PLACE UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SO WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE ANY. EFFECTS FROM THAT THIS YEAR BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT YEAR. ANOTHER THING THE ALSO THAT'S PERMANENT THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY AFTER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE. ANOTHER THING THEY DID IS CHANGE THE WAY THEY CALCULATE THE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR BRACKETS IN FOR A THE STANDARD DEDUCTION AND THAT SORT OF THING. WITH THE THEY ONE USES A DIFFERENT METHOD OF. DETERMINING THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CHANGES IN A CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. THE UPSHOT OF THAT IS THAT. IN MOST YEARS YOU WOULD EXPECT A SLIGHTLY LOWER INFLATION ADJUSTMENT THAN WE'D WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. UNDER THE OLD LAW. INVENT THAT'S ALSO A PERMANENT CHANGE IT DOESN'T GO BACK TO THE OLD LAW AFTER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE SO. THIS CHANGE ISN'T EXPECTED TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT RIGHT AWAY BUT OVER TIME MIDDLE ACCUMULATED HAVE A SLIGHTLY LOWER INFLATION ADJUSTMENT EVERY YEAR. AND SO BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S ACTUALLY A. FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT PIECE. FINALLY ONE THING THEY DID WAS INCREASE THE EXEMPTIONS FOR. THE ESTATE TAX IN OTHER WORDS THEY WERE. THE INCREASED THE THRESHOLD OF THE SIZE OF IN THE STATE THE TAXES DUE ON IN SO. THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT. FEWER PEOPLE TO HAVE TO PAY THE ESTATE TAX IN THE WERE A COLLECT LESS MONEY FROM. FINALLY THE LAST SLIDE SHOWS SOME OF THE BUSINESS PROVISIONS. THERE REDUCING THE CORPORATE RATE FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. AND THEY'RE ALSO. PUTTING IF A TEMPORARY PROVISION FOR FIVE YEARS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO. BASICALLY DEDUCT ALL THE COST OF NEW EQUIPMENT THAT ALLOWS CORPORATIONS I SAY TO. ALL THE COSTS NEW EQUIPMENT THEY BY IN THE FIRST YEAR INSTEAD OF USING A DEPRECIATION SCHEDULE LIKE THAT TO DO UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. OKAY THEY PAY FOR SOME OF THIS BY LIMITING THE DEDUCTION THAT. CORPORATIONS CAN TAKE ON INTEREST THEY PAY. IN SOME OTHER. DEDUCTIONS RELATING TO NET OPERATING LOSSES AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT RECRUITS A LOT OF THE REVENUE. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE FROM REDUCING THE RATE IN ALLOWING THIS EXPENSING BUT IT DOESN'T RECOUP AT ALL. ANOTHER THING THEY DO IS THEM. DEALS WITH THE TREATMENT OF THE FOUR FILL THE OVERSEAS AFFILIATES OF THE U. S. CORPORATIONS. THE WAY IT WAS DONE UNDER THE OLD LAW. ALL THE INCOME OF THE CORPORATION WHETHER THEY EARN IT IN THE U. S. OR ABROAD WAS TAXED IN SORT OF TOTALED UP BUT THE INCOME OF THEIR OVERSEAS AFFILIATES WAS NOT TAXED UNTIL IT'S PULLED BACK INTO THE U. S.. LIFE WITH THE DOING NOW IS A SORT OF GETTING RID OF THAT IN. TREATING THE U. S. AFFILIATE COMPLETELY SEPARATELY FOR THE FOREIGN AFFILIATE BUT. BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE CORPORATIONS HAD A LOT OF MONEY SORT OF. STORED UP IN THEIR OVERSEAS AFFILIATES THAT HADN'T BEEN TAXED YET WITH THE DOING IS IMPOSING A ONE TIME TAX ON THAT AT A MUCH LOWER RATE. THAN THE A CURRENT CORPORATE RATE. BUT AFTER THAT IT JUST SORT OF GOES AWAY AND IT BECOMES SOME. JUST INCOME OF THEIR FOREIGN AFFILIATES WHICH IS IN. WE JUST TREAT AS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ENTITY NOW FROM THEIR A U. S. AFFILIATE. AND THAT'S THE LAST SLIDE I HAVE. I'M DANIEL HUMMEL FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS SURROUNDING THE NEW TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP ON THE SAME LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. AYE AND STRATEGIES THAT OTHER STATES ARE PURSUING TO PRODUCER OF THE ABILITY OF THEIR RESIDENTS TO PAY FOR STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS. ON AND THEN A PROFESSOR SANSKI WILL SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT CHAIR OF A CREDIT. OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER POSSIBLE CHANGES AT TO THE CALIFORNIA CODE SO I AM FROM ILLINOIS AND SHE PROFESSED. A. M.. RETRIEVE IGNORANCE ABOUT AYE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC ISSUES. BROUGHT UP BY. MUCH OF WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW OTHER STATES OTHER STATES THAT SOMEONE CALLED HIGH TAX STATES OTHER STATES THAT INVEST HEAVILY BY IN. PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PUBLICLY PROVIDED HEALTH CARE A ARE ARE GRAPPLING WITH I CHIU FIRST ON SLIDE FOR AND I THINK THIS IS I AGREE A GREAT PLACE TO START. YOU MIGHT SAY WHY ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT THIS AYE THIS FAMILY IS EXPERIENCING A AT TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR DECREASE IN THEIR NET TAX LIABILITY. AND MOST TELEPHONES WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILLS GO DOWN WHEN THEY FILE IN APRIL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. WELL. THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS ONE IS ON WHERE'S THAT IF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE BY NO LONGER GOING FROM THIS FAMILY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OUT WILL WHAT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT I DO NOW IT'S GOT LESS MONEY IT'S IT'S GOT TWO OPTIONS ONE IT COULD RAISE TAXES IN THE FUTURE. BY IN WHICH CASE BUT THIS IS A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR GAIN NOW FOR THE FAMILY BUT I THERE ARE THE PARENTS OR THEIR KIDS DOWN THE ROAD ARE GOING TO PAY MORE SO IF THEY THINK THEY'RE BETTER OFF. BY THEN THEY'RE LIVING UNDER AN ILLUSION. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL I THINK WE'LL JUST SPEND LESS RIGHT WE WILL SEE FEDERAL LEVEL PUBLIC SECTOR DISINVESTMENT. I AND IF THAT'S THE CASE WILL SOMEONE ELSE TO PICK UP THE SLACK ON AND HISTORICALLY THAT HAS FALLEN TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND ADDITIONALLY AT THE AT THE HIGH END IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY SEE PEOPLE'S MARGINAL RATES GOING UP. TOP STATUTORY RATE WENT DOWN FROM THIRTY NINE POINT SIX PERCENT TO THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT BUT IF YOU'RE A HIGH BRACKET TAXPAYER IN CALIFORNIA. PREVIOUSLY FOR ANOTHER DOLLAR YOU AREN'T YOU WOULD PAY OFF FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT CENTS IN CALIFORNIA INCOME AND FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. THIRTY NINE POINT SIX PERCENT PLUS ONE POINT TWO PERCENT FOR SOMETHING CALLED. THAT THE PEACE PROVISION BOMB WHICH IS NOW GONE AWAY ARM AND THEN YOU WOULD PAY AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT AT THE TOP RATED CALIFORNIA. BOMB BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DEDUCT THAT AGAINST YOUR FEDERAL TAXES SO IT WOULD BE AS IF YOU'RE PAYING A PERCENT CALIFORNIA TAX RATE AFTER YOU FACTOR IN THE FEDERAL DEDUCTIONS THAT TOTALS UP TO FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT. NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE TAUGHT FEDERAL RATE IS THIRTY SEVEN BUT YOU'RE STE PAIN THIRTEEN POINT THREE TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU'RE NOT DEDUCTING THAT. BUT SO YOUR TOP MARGINAL RATE IS GOING FROM FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO FIFTY POINT THREE PERCENT TO ACTUALLY DO YOU SEE FOR SOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AN INCREASE AYE IN MARGINAL RATES IN THE MARGINAL RATES THAT THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HOW MUCH. IS THE GOVERNMENT MANY TAKE FOR MY NEXT I NEXT DOLLAR. AND FOR A LARGE PORTION OF CALIFORNIANS WE SEE AN INCREASE IN THE AFTER TAX PRICE OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF I WERE A TOP BRACKET TAXPAYER AND I WERE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH WILL AN EXTRA DOLLAR. OF CALIFORNIA SPENDING COST ME WELL I WOULD PAN EXTRA DOLLAR IN STATE TAXES TO CALIFORNIA AND THEN I WOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM A THIRTY NINE POINT SIX PERCENT DEDUCTION CALL IT FORTY PERCENT. SO ESSENTIALLY I AM PAYING SIXTY SET SIXTY POINT FOUR CENTS FOR EXTRA DOLLAR OF STATE LOCAL PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES. ONCE I GET OVER THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP NOW I'M PAYING A DOLLAR FOR AN EXTRA DOLLAR OF STATE AND LOCAL. PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES AND THIS AFFECTS NOT ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE HIT BY THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP. BUT A HUGE PORTION THE POPULATION IS GOING TO SHIFT FROM ITEMIZING TO CLAIMING THE STANDARD DEDUCTIONS SO RIGHT NOW ABOUT A THIRD OF INDIVIDUALS ITEMIZE ON THEIR TAX RETURNS. I BUT WITH THE STANDARD DEDUCTION GOING UP TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A MARRIED COUPLE. ACTUALLY DOT THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE MARRIED COUPLE WITH TWO KIDS ARE BETTER OFF NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE LOSING PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS AND DEDUCTIONS BUT IT MEANS THAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO ITEMIZE IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ITEMIZED DEDUCTION. AND FEWER THAN THE OTHER APPROXIMATELY ONE TENTH OF THE POPULATION WILL ITEMIZE UNDER THE NEW REGIME SO WE'RE GOING FROM A THIRD TO ONE TASK SO FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER ITEMIZING. FOR THEM THE AFTER TAX PRICE OF STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT SERVICES IS GOING UP A LOT BUT AND THIS IS AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE ASKING STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO MORE BECAUSE A FEDERAL LEVEL PUBLIC SECTOR. AYE DISINVESTMENT. SO THERE'S I THINK GOOD ECONOMETRIC RESEARCH ON HOW STATE IN STATES AND LOCALITIES RESPOND TO ARE THE INCENTIVES CREATED BY FEDERAL TAX LAW AND I THINK THEY DO RESPOND THOUGH YOU CAN GET A BUNCH OF ECONOMISTS IN THE ROOM. AND BY. YOU WOULD GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STORIES NAM ON THAT. ONE INTUITIVELY WELL WHEN THE PRICE OF A GOOD OR SERVICE GOES UP. PEOPLE BY LAST. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS IS DOING IS FOR A LARGE PORTION OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION RAISING THE PRICE A PUBLIC SECTOR PROVIDED GOODS AND SERVICES. I. SO IS THIS A PROBLEM OUT WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT IT WELL MORE THAN HALF OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER STATES GOES TOWARD HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT. EDUCATION ADVOCATED TWELVE LEVEL AND AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL. AND HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE HERE AS I JUST AND TALKED ABOUT A SHIFT TOWARD EXPENSING WHICH IS IN IMMEDIATE RIGHT OFF FOR NEW INVESTMENT IN PHYSICAL CAPITAL. HOW IS IT THAT WE'RE MOVING TOWARD AN IMMEDIATE RIGHT OFF FOR NEW INVESTMENT IN PHYSICAL CAPITAL BUT DENYING A DEDUCTION FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WHO ARE EFFECTIVELY INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL? THROUGH STATES AND LOCALITIES. A MOREOVER NOT CONGRESS DECIDED THAT IT ONE TO PRESERVE THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS BY KEEPING THE EXCLUSION FOR EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE. I AND BY ACTUALLY EXPANDING THE MEDICAL EXPENSE DEDUCTION. WELL IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES THAT INVEST ROBUSTLY IN THEIR PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. PART OF WHAT WE PAY FOR HEALTHCARE IS TO STAY LEVEL TAX. BOB WEIR WE RIPPING AWAY THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS. AND MOREOVER OUT ONE OF THE GOALS OF THAT TAX REFORM WAS CHU I CONTINUE TO PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP THAT WAS WHY THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION DIDN'T GO AWAY AND IT THAT THE ROLLBACK OF THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION AFFECTS A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE EVEN IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT I MEAN A CALIFORNIA HAS MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER STATE WITH A MORTGAGE LOANS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR STILL TALKING ABOUT A PRETTY HIGH INCOME SET. BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S ACTUALLY THE DEDUCTION FOR STATE LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES THAT IS THE ONE FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVE THAT THEY GET FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP. I THEY GET IF THEY OWN THEIR OWN HOME NOT IF THEY RENT AND AFTER THEY PAY DOWN THEIR MORTGAGE LOAN THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION ANYMORE SO THAT INCENTIVE FOR A HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS GOING AWAY. OKAY SO HOW DO WE PRESERVE THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO PAY FOR PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS IF CALIFORNIA THINK THAT THAT'S ARE A DESIRABLE GOAL. THEIR THREE APPROACHES THAT STATES HAVE BEEN TAKING. ONE IS ARE A PAYROLL TAX SHIFT. BUT IN NEW YORK HAS BEEN THE LEADER ON THE S. AND THE IDEA IS PREVIOUSLY LET'S SAY THAT YOU HAD A FIVE PERCENT STATE TAX RATE. STATE INCOME TAX RATE. YOU ARE A HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER. FIVE DOLLARS GOES TO THE STATE NINETY FIVE DOLLARS GOES TO YOU. IF YOU CAN CLAIM THE SAME LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION YOUR FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME IS NINETY FIVE DOLLARS. NOW WE'RE TAKING THE ABILITY OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. TO DEDUCT WELL WHY NOT JUST SAY TO MY EMPLOYER WHILE YOU PAY ME NINETY FIVE. YOU PAY FIVE TO THE STATE. MY GROSS INCOME FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES IS NINETY FIVE. I'M NO WORSE OFF BEFORE ACTUALLY I'M BETTER OFF BEFORE I THAN BEFORE ON BECAUSE NOW WE'RE BETTER OFF THAN I WOULD BE UNDER THE NEW TRUMP TAX PLAN BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TAXING ME ON NINETY FIVE RATHER THAN HUNT. AND MY EMPLOYER IS JUST AS HAPPY BECAUSE THEY KNEW TAX LAW PRESERVES THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO DEDUCT STAY MOBILE TAX. SO THIS WORKS THIS IS REALLY EASY TO IMPLEMENT IN A FLAT TAX STATE LIKE ILLINOIS. BUT IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED IN PROGRESSIVE TAX STATES LIKE NEW YORK IN CALIFORNIA NEW YORK IS ACTUALLY IN LISTED A WHOLE BUNCH OF ACADEMICS BY IN DEVELOPING A CREDIT APPROACH. I THAT WOULD ALLOW IT WOULD KEEP THE INCOME TAX IN PLACE WE WOULD IMPOSE A PAYROLL TAX ON WAGES INDIVIDUALS WITH THEN GET TO CLAIM A CREDIT AGAINST SATAN A STATE INCOME TAXES FOR THE PAYROLL TAXES PAID BY THE EMPLOYER. AND NEW YORK IS FIGURE OUT A FORMULA AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS OF IT THAT. CREATES A PROGRESSIVE CREDIT THAT BEN PRESERVES THE PROGRESSIVITY OF THE OVERALL TAX SYSTEM. KNOW THIS ONLY AFFECTS REGION CALM BUT IT ACTUALLY EXPANDS THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION IN SOME RESPECTS BEYOND WHERE IT WAS PRE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BECAUSE REMEMBER PRE SEVEN A PRE TWENTY OR PRE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIRTY THE POPULATIONS ITEMIZING THAT MEANS THAT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE WEREN'T CLAIM THAT'S A LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION THEY WERE CLAIMING THE STANDARD DEDUCTION. THIS WOULD I CHANGE THIS WOULD ALLOW EVERYONE WHO GET WARRANTS WAGES TO PAY WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. SO YOU'RE INCREASE YOUR YOUR FEDERAL GROSS INCOME GOES FROM A HUNDRED TO NINETY FIVE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU TAKE THE STANDARD DEDUCTION OR YOU ITEMIZE THE CHALLENGING CALIFORNIA'S I UNDERSTAND THIS WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. OF UP THE LEGISLATURE THAT SAID IT'S A WIN WIN. FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A WIN FOR US FOR EMPLOYEES WHOSE WAGES ARE WHOSE AFTER TAX WAGES WOULD GO UP RIGHT AND BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY THEY ALL OF THEM COULD NOW CLAIM A FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTION BUT VERY FEW OF THEM. WILL CLAIM UNDER THE NEW STATUS QUO AND FROM EMPLOYERS IS DESIRABLE BECAUSE IF EMPLOYERS ARE ENOUGH APPLE IS TRYING TO LURE AN ENGINEER AWAY FROM AYE DALLIN TAXES WELL THE FACT THAT THE SALT DEDUCTION HAS GONE AWAY OR GONE AWAY FOR MOST PEOPLE MAKES CALIFORNIA LESS ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS CLIMATE. IF CALIFORNIA CAN EFFECTIVELY BRING BACK THIS A LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION FOR EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA WELL THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD WATCH YES NOW THEY'RE TECHNICALLY PAYING ATTACKS BEFORE THEY WORK. OUR BUT I AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. WOULD WOULD SEEM TO BE BETTER OFF. THE SECOND APPROACH AND. IS TO IMPOSE A TAX ON PASS THROUGHS ON PARTNERSHIPS ASK OPERATIONS AYE AND SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS THAT WOULD BE PAID OUT THE PARTNERSHIP LEVEL OR AT THE SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP LEVEL OR AT THE ESCORT LEVEL. AND IT WOULD BE A TAX ON THE ENTITIES AND CON AND THEN THE PARTNER THE SOLE PROPRIETOR WOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM. A CREDIT ON BY HIS OR HER OWN STATE INCOME TAXES UP FOR WHAT THE SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP HAS PAID NEW YORK ACTUALLY NEW YORK CITY ALREADY DOES THIS AND SO IF YOU WERE AN UBER DRIVER IN NEW YORK CITY. YOU ARE A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP YOUR SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP PAYS A TAX TO NEW YORK YOU THEN CLAIM A CREDIT FOR IT. ON YOUR NEW YORK CITY INCOME TAXES I AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS THAT TO BE A TAX PAID BY THE BUSINESS RATHER THAN A TAX PAID BY YOU SO EVEN IF AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CLAIM THE STANDARD DEDUCTION. YOUR THIS STILL ALLOWS YOU TO PAY IN NEW YORK LOCAL INCOME TAXES WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE PRETTY EASY BY IT. TO IMPLEMENT THIS AT THE STATE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN IS THAT THE THE TWO THIRDS. REQUIREMENT BUT I. CONNECTICUT IS MOVING FULL SPEED AHEAD ON THIS. AND. AT NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK ARE CONSIDERING THIS TO THE THIRD APPROACH ARE ON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA I THINK I THOUGHT LEADERS IN THE ROOM. ON THIS I IS THE CHARITABLE CREDIT APPROACH WHICH. MY COLLEAGUE PROFESSOR CHANCE IT WILL I TALK ABOUT MORE DETAIL. GREAT ON. THANK YOU AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE SO I'M. TODAY ARE KIND OF TAG TEAM IT'S WISE WANT TO ADD JUST A FEW THINGS TO. ARM. TO WHAT HE TO HIS REMARKS THAT I WILL PIVOT TO THE CHARITABLE DEDUCTION SO FIRST I JUST WANTED TO. MAKE BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FTP IS PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE EFFECT OF THE TAX CUT JOBS ACT WHICH HAD SOME NUMBERS. IN TERMS OF ITEMIZED OR SO STILL BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF TWO MILLION PEOPLE ALL OF TAXPAYERS WHO WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE SOFT CAP QUITE WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TALK MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT NOW WILL NOT. OF THOSE UNDER A MILLION. WELL ACTUALLY END UP PAYING MORE THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE SO THERE IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO REALLY BE HIT BY THE CAP. TWO MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE HIT TWO MILLION WHO BE HAD SOMEONE NOW IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF PROP FIFTY FIVE AND BECAUSE OF ALL THE TO ALL UP ALTHOUGH I'M LOCAL ELECTIONS OUR CAR TWO THIRDS VOTE. THE QUESTION OF TAX PRICE ON IT AND TERMS OF THE. FEELING THAT PEOPLE HAVE AS TO HOW MUCH THEIR ON TAXES ARE GOING TO COST THAT IS SIGNIFICANT RIGHT AWAY RIGHT SO THESE PLEASE VOTERS ARE GOING TO BE ASKED. TO INCREASE INCREASED LOCAL TAXES RIGHT AND WHAT THEIR NEXT ON BOND LECTURES RIGHT WITH AN EX PARCEL TAX ELECTION HAD SO. PROP FIFTY FIVE DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL TWO THOUSAND THIRTY BUT THEN THE WILL BE HERE THEORETICALLY REQUESTED INCREASED THOSE TAXES IN THOSE TAXPAYERS WILL SUDDENLY BE HAVING A FORTY PERCENT HIGHER TAX PRICE. IN THE MEDIUM TERM AND SHORT TERM THERE'S GOING TO BE. HIS PARCEL TAX AND BOND ELECTIONS WHERE I'M AT THIS TAX PRICE IS GOING TO MATTER. PUMPHOUSE WHAT THE STATE COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT THE PAYROLL AN ENTITY LEVEL TAXES THE CAN BEFORE WE GO TO THE CHARITABLE DEDUCTION SO. THE PAYROLL TAX ID I GUESS I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER ASPECT IS THAT. MEMBER CONTINUITY COLLECTS A PAYROLL TAX IN THE CUT CONTEXT WAS UNEMPLOYMENT SHARON'S AHMED SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO STICK TO TO P. BACK ON THAT TOOK HIM TO THE ADMISSIBILITY. OF THE TAX AND PAYROLL TAXES. YOU KNOW HOW PLUSES AND MINUSES ONE OF THEIR. PLUSES IS THAT THEY'RE RELATIVELY SIMPLE WAY OF FUNDING I'M BROAD BASED SOCIAL SERVICES RIGHT THAT'S HOW WE USE IT FOR HER POINT SHERATON STILL SECURITY. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT ON IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHER THINGS. COULD WE DO IF WE ARE GOING TO. USE THE. ON WELCOME SPUR OF THIS TAX PLAN TO CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S TAX SYSTEM WHAT CAN WE DO THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO YOU ANYWAY. SO FOR INSTANCE I'M IN THE HEALTH CARE CONTEXT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET THE TAX CREDITS RIGHT AND DON'T GET EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE. OF WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM SOME BENEFITS. BY IMPOSING I'M OUT UP SOME PORTION OF THIS PAYROLL TAX TOWARDS PROVIDING HEALTH CARE CREDITS I'M TO THOSE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AISLE THAT DON'T KNOW THAT'S JUST A PROPOSAL BUT THE IDEA IS THAT. WE SHOULD TRY TO VIEW WHAT I'M THIS TAX PLAN IS FORCING US TO DO IS NOT WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND NOT BE POORLY RESPONSIVE. ANOTHER ON BENEFIT. THINK ABOUT TERMS OF THE ENTITY LEVEL TAXATION SORT OF THE NEW YORK UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS TAX IS TO REMEMBER THAT THE. TRUMP TAX PLAN CREATES THIS TWENTY PERCENT ON DEDUCTION FIRST I'M QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME. AT LEAST IN A LOT OF CASES. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA. AND SO IF WE WERE GOING TO IMPOSE IT. UNKNOWN CORPORATE BUSINESS TAX SOME KIND OF I'M A BUSINESS ACT IT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLAW BACK ON SOME SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS. AND FURTHERMORE THERE'S A LARGER QUESTION IS AS TO WHY AS IT IS WE TAX CORPORATIONS. AND NOT OTHER LARGE BUSINESS ENTITIES SO AGAIN BEFORE THINKING OF CHANGING CALIFORNIA'S TAX SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO THIS DE. ALL CHANGES WHAT ARE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT TO DO ANYWAY SO TO THE SAYS THERE ARE ONLY TAXING CORPORATIONS AND OTHER LARGE BUSINESSES. THERE WAS NEVER A GOOD REASON TO DO THAT OVER GOING TO HAPPEN UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS TAX LET'S HAVE OF. ATTACKS ON LARGE INCORPORATED BUSINESSES TO PUT THEM ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD CORPORATIONS AND MAYBE EVEN CLUB BACK ON SOME OF THE QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME. PERHAPS. OKAY SO I WANNA FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THE THIRD I'M OPTION THE ONE THAT'S GOTTEN FROM THEM OF THE FARTHEST LEGISLATIVELY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S USING CHARITABLE CREDITS. THE. COME NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW AS WE NOW KNOW PERHAPS THE STATE LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION IT DOES NOT CAP THE CHARITABLE. THE CHARITABLE DEDUCTION IS ALSO AN ITEMIZED DEDUCTION AND OF THE A PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SAYS YOU CAN DEDUCT A CONTRIBUTION TO A STATE LAW GOVERNMENT. AND SO THE IDEA IS TO ARM PERMIT TAXPAYERS TO I'M GIVE TARGETED CONTRIBUTIONS ON TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RETURN FOR AN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. SPENT TWO I'M ROUGHLY SUMMARIZING THE BILL'S WHO SORT OF COMING FROM THE SENATE SIDE S. B. TO TWENTY SEVEN S. B. FIVE EIGHTY ONE SO AGAIN. A TAXPAYER MAKES A CONTRIBUTION TO. A STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND GETS AND EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT CREDIT AND THEN THEY GET TO DIRECT SOME OF THEIR FUNDS TOWARDS A PARTICULAR PROGRAM RIGHT SO THE COMPONENT IS. EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT CREDIT WHICH MEANS THAT. THE STATE. THAT'S MONEY RIGHT THE TAXPAYER IS GIVING MORE THE TAXPAYER GETS ADDITIONAL DIRECTION BY DISTANCE TO SAY WHERE THE MONEY'S OING TO GO. TO TAXPAYERS BETTER OFF BECAUSE EVEN AT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT CREDIT IF THEY'RE IN THE THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TAX BRACKET THE HIGHEST MARGINAL RATE. THEY'LL STILL DOING WELL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE THERE'D ADOPTION GREATER ON THEN THE AMOUNT OF THE ADDITIONAL DOCTOR PAY TO CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA AND THE QUESTION IS. DOES THAT WORK RIGHT WHAT IS TO I'M I'M LEGAL STATUS OF THE. SURE AND SO. AND WE CAN GO REALLY DEEP IN THE WEEDS ON THIS BUT THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT. ARE THE CONCERN IS THAT. THE STATE IS BASICALLY GIVING SOMETHING BACK TO THE. SO. HOW CAN THAT BE A CHARITABLE DONATION RIGHT IF THE STATE IS GIVING YOU EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREDIT UP TO STILL THE NATION BACK IT CAN'T BE ACCOUNTABLE CONTRIBUTION? AND THE ANSWER IS HOW THE TAX CODE ANALYZE HIS TAX CUT SO FOR INSTANCE. WHEN NEVADA. GAVE BIG TAX CREDITS TO TESLA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T SAY OH WELL TESLA YOU AVOIDED ALL THAT TAX IN THE BONTA. THAT COUNTS AS INCOME TO YOU WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TAX YOU ON THE INCOME YOU AVOID IT RIGHT THAT'S NOT HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THE FEDERAL TAX CODE. CONCEIVES OF STATE LOCAL TAXES RIGHT A CONCEIVES OF THESE TAX INCENTIVES TO HAVE A STATE OF PALESTINE OVER. DECIDING TO REDUCE YOUR TAX LIABILITY RIGHT IT'S NOT CONCEIVED OF AS MONEY THAT YOU HAD AND THEN DIDN'T PAY AND SO. THAT RULE IS FAIRLY WELL ESTABLISHED IN FEDERAL TAX LAW AND SO. THERE ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THIRTY STATES THAT GIVE SUBSTANTIAL CREDITS. AND THERE ARE ETERNAL IRIS DOCUMENTS PARTICULAR. MEMORANDUM WHICH IF COUNSEL'S OFFICE ARTICULATING THIS POSITION. THAT EVEN IF A CREDIT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT THE. IRIS IS POSITION AGAIN BORROWING THEY HAVE A PROVISO THEIR UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE. CLEARLY IN AN AREA THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY AWARE OF RIGHT THIS IS NOT. SOMETHING THAT IS UNASSAILABLE AND IT'S ONE REASON WE HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW WE DESIGN. OUR PROGRAM BUT FOR THE MOST PART CREDITS ARE TREATED AS A REDUCTION OF STATE AND LOCAL TAX LIABILITY AND NOT AS INCOME TO THE TAXPAYER AND THAT RULE IS IMPORTANT IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS NOT JUST. THIS CONTEXT SO FOR INSTANCE A LOT OF CREDITS ARE TRANSFERABLE. AND SO IF YOU TRANSFER CREDIT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR BASIS IN THE CREDIT THIS IS SORT OF IN THE WEEDS TAX. POLICY BUT IF THE CREDIT GIVEN TO YOU WAS TREATED AS INCOME TO YOU. THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE A BASIS IN THAT TAX CREDIT BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE GOVERNMENT GAVE YOU TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS AND YOU PAY TAX ON IT. AND THEN WHEN YOU GO ON TO SELL IT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK. THAT'S NEVER BEEN THE WAY THE IRS IS TREATED THESE. SINCE SO. THERE'S UP. GET A STRONG AND LEGAL FOUNDATION NOT YOU KNOW. DID THIS PARTICULAR CASE HAS NEVER BEEN POLITICALLY CRISIS IMPORTANT EMPHASIZE THAT BUT THERE'S A STRONG LEGAL FOUNDATION THAT. TAX CREDITS ARE TREATED AS REDUCTION AND NOT HIS INCOME TAXPAYER. AND WE THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TAXPAYER IS ACTUALLY CHANGING THEIR POSITION VIS A VIS THE STATE AT PARTICIPATING MORE. INFANTRY IT CONTRIBUTED TO STATE GOVERNMENT THAT IS GOING TO BE ON A STRONG RIGHT THOUGH NOT UNASSAILABLE POSITION ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS OR OR. OP APPROACHES TO CONSIDER. THAT. ARIZONA HAS A PROGRAM WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT CREDIT THAT YOU CAN GIVE TO YOU I'M STUDENT TUITION ORGANIZATIONS AND THOSE STUDENT TUITION ORGANIZATIONS CAN ACTUALLY USE THAT MONEY. TO SEND STUDENTS TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS INCLUDING SECTARIAN SCHOOLS AND THE QUESTION WAS WELL. CAN YOU DO THAT AT THAT VIOLATE THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE ISN'T THAT SPENDING PUBLIC DOLLARS ON IN SUPPORT TOP RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION THE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SUPREME COURT AND ACTUALLY TO STANDING CASE. OF IT BUT THE UPSHOT IS THE SUPREME COURT SAID IF YOU USE CREE GOV CREDIT IS NOT SPENDING MONEY. RIGHT IT'S A REDUCTION OF TAX LIABILITY AND SO DOES NOT VIOLATE THE ESTO. AND SO ULTIMATELY ARIZONA ARIZONA'S PROGRAM WAS ON UPHELD. WHICH MEANS IN EFFECT THAT YOU CAN CURRENTLY USE TAX CREDITS A HUNDRED PERCENT TAX CREDITS I'M TO FUND PRIVATE AND SECTARIAN SCHOOLS AND SO WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING IS IF YOU CAN USE ALMOST LARGE TAX CREDITS TO FUND PRIVATE SCHOOLS HOW COULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO USE THOSE KINDS OF CREDITS TO FUND PUBLIC. AND THAT'S THE THE IDEA ON BEHIND THOSE KINDS. TAKE MORE QUESTIONS OUT ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND BEFORE I STOP THOUGH I DO WANT TO. TALK BRIEFLY BRIEFLY BRIEFLY. ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROVISION. POPPED UP THE BUT I WANT USED MAKES LIVE TO. TWO POINTS I'M ONE IS THAT. THE. THE SHIP TO A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM AT THE ADVENT OF I'M SOME ENTIRELY NEW KINDS OF TAXES IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF THOUGHT. HOW THAT INTERACTS WITH CALIFORNIA? AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE I'M SETTLED NECESSARILY IMMEDIATELY BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT VERY CAREFULLY. BECAUSE. IT'S IT IT IT. WELL HONESTLY WITH THAT WE CAN. THE SECOND THING IS MORE PRESSING SO INSOFAR AS. THE CHANGE FROM A WORLDWIDE SYSTEM OF TAXATION TO A TERRITORIAL SYSTEM MEANS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HIS DEMAND THAT TWO POINT SIX TRILLION HOWEVER MUCH THAT'S OUTSTANDING. TO BE REPATRIATED AND REPATRIATED AS OF DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. AND THAT MONEY IS COMING HOME AND THE QUESTION IS. WILL THE STATE'S ON TAX THAT. AND RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA'S AND WE HAD AGAINST HIM PER THE FTP IS PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS IS NOT GOING TO TAX THAT MONEY VERY MUCH. AND THE REASON IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAX LAW WASN'T WRITTEN WITH THAT MADRE THIS IS DID THAT JUST IT GOES NO FAULT HERE IS JUST THAT. THERE'S A NEW SECTION NIGHT SIXTY FIVE OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE THAT ACHIEVES THIS TEAM REPATRIATION. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT LAW DOESN'T REALLY REFERRED TO DO YOU TO TO SECTION NINE SIXTY FIVE AND THIS IS NOT REALLY. AYE AYE HE SAYS THE FTP SEASON A STATUTORY HOKE TOM TO TAX ON THAT INCOME I THINK THAT. THAT WITHOUT THAT IS UNFORTUNATE ON THE AND THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AND ESPECIALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE BELIEVES IS AS I THINK. THAT A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT TWO POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS WAS ACT WAS ACTUALLY EARNED IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS STRATEGICALLY MOVED A BROUHAHA ABROAD AND SO. TO THE EXTENT OF THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY I'M TO TAX THAT REVENUE. I THINK THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD IT WOULD NEED TO COME A CHANGED LOCKED. THANK YOU I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA HAS TO GO SO DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I'M. ARE THERE EFFORTS A FOOT AT THE MOMENT ON THE EMPLOYEES. ON THE PLAYER PAYROLL TAX SIDE ADJUSTMENT I KNOW YOU WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE I THINK NEW YORK HE SAID IS DOING IT IN. AND OTHERS AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IN EACH SORT OF TALK ABOUT OF A FOUNDATION. BOB. OF. THESE ARE PAYROLL TAXES ALREADY THAT WE CAN BUILD ON THAT IS THAT A ME THAT YOU A MATTER OF MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TODAY OR JUST KIND OF LAYING OUT OPTIONS BUT IS THAT SUMMIT YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE. IT WE DO HAVE A SPOT BILL IN PLACE FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT NEW YORK IS DOING WE WERE JUST KIND OF WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT NEW YORK'S LOOK LIKE AND BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE SUCH A ROBUST AND. GROUP LOOKING AT WHAT THAT IS GOING TO KEEP EVOLVING INTO SO WE HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE TO. WE NOW HAVE DROPPED LEGISLATION FROM NEW YORK WHICH ARE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS POSTED ONLINE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. A COPY GETS TO YOU IT SAM IT'S WRITTEN INSERTED NEW YORK LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE WHICH SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE. ON BUT THIS IS I GUESS ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT NEW YORK STATE POLITICS IS THAT WHEN GOVERNOR CUOMO SEIZES UPON AN IDEA THINGS BEGIN TO HAPPEN AND THERE'S AN APRIL FIRST DEADLINE FOR THE BUDGET. I AND THIS WAS A PLANK IN HIS BUDGET PLATFORM FROM THE STATE OF THE STATE. AYE SO THERE IS. MEALS ARE SPENDING AYE OR THAT MAKES IT SOUND BAD I'M ENGINES ARE. ENGINES ARE BOOMING IN NEW IN NEW YORK. THANK YOU AND INSERTED YOU KNOW I I THINK YOU'RE FRAMING. SO TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AS. IF IF IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO HAVE. HAVE LOCAL STATE INCOME TAXES PAID WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS HERE SOME OF OUR CHOICES. WE DEATHLY WANT THAT. ARE THESE THE ONLY CHOICES. I THINK. I MEAN GIVEN THAT THERE'S BEEN THERE'S LIMITS NOW ON THE. WHAT WE CAN DO WITH PROPERTY INCOME AND SALES TAXES THAT? BUT DOESN'T LEGAL A WHOLE LOT I MEAN THERE'S A THEIR AS KNOW PROFESSOR SHE ASK YOU MENTIONED WE DO WE ALREADY HAVE A PAYROLL TAX OR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND SO. VISIT THE STATE WANTED TO WE COULD BE SO GO BIGGER ON THE PAYROLL TAX AND MAYBE SMALLER ON THE OTHER TAXES. WITH OR WITHOUT THE CREDIT THAT WAS SUGGESTED. WE THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS OF SETTING IT UP. AND ALL AND WHILE I THINK THESE ARE REALLY THE ONLY THREE PROPOSALS THAT I'VE HEARD. SPINOUT AM. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND IF YOU IMPLEMENTED ALL THREE. YOU WOULD GET A PRETTY CLOSE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT COVERAGE. FOR AT LEAST FOR STATE INCOME TAXES BUT SO. EMPLOYEES ARE OUT WOULD. CLAIM THE WOULD WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE PAYROLL TAX SHIFT. FOLKS WITH PASSED THROUGH INCOME WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS. AND THEN FOLKS WITH OTHER SORTS OF AND CALM DIVIDEND INCOME CAPITAL GAINS AND COM WOULD BE ABLE TO. PROFITS THE EFFECTS OF THE FEDERAL. ROLLBACK BY USING SOMETHING LIKE THE CHARITABLE CREDIT. APPROACH. GOOD JUST IN THAT IN THAT VEIN I. CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR PEOPLE IN EACH CATEGORY WHETHER IT'S THE TERRIBLE DONATION OF THE PAYROLL TAX WHAT THAT PERSON LOOKED LIKE SO. HOW MUCH DOES THAT PERSON MAKE LIKE IT ANY VERY KIND OF VISUAL WAY CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT PERSON FOR EACH FOR EACH CATEGORY WHAT THAT PERSON LOOKS LIKE THAT BENEFITS FROM EACH OF THE OPTION? NOT JUST IN IT IT'S HARD I KNOW BUT IT'S REALLY WHAT HELPED THEY THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT. PASSED OUT WHETHER THEY WHETHER THEY FILE ITEMIZED ARE. BUT SUIT TO THE PAYROLL TAX A APPROACH IS GOING TO BENEFIT. I. FOLKS IN THE BOTTOM NINETY PERCENT WHO ARE NOT ITEMIZING DEDUCTIONS IT'S I WHO CLAIMING THE STANDARD DEDUCTION. IT DOESN'T MATTER ALL THAT MUCH FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR MARRIED COUPLES MAKING LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANY FEDERAL TAX ANYWAY. BUT ONCE YOU GET ABOVE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IT IT DOES START TO MATTER EVEN IF YOU'RE IN THE TEN PERCENT BRACKET WHILE YOU'D RATHER PAY NINETY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. THEN A HUNDRED CENTS ON THE DOLLAR AND WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE PRACTICALLY ARM IS YOU STILL FILE A CALIFORNIA RETURN I AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND AND WE WOULD HAVE A NEW CATEGORY OF. WE COULD CALL IT WAGES PAID BY GOLDEN STATE EMPLOYERS. YOU COULD BECOME A A A GOLDEN STATE EMPLOYER A GOLDEN STATE EIGHT NEW YORK IS DOING THIS WE THEIR SOMETIMES CALLED EMPIRE WORKS EMPLOYERS AN IGNORANT BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO COLLEGE FIREWORKS. AND AND NEW YORK ACTUALLY. ALLOWS YOU TO ELECT INTO EMPIRE WORKS EMPLOYER STATUS IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE. YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE IT MANDATORY AS LONG AS THERE'S AN IRREVOCABLE ELECTION SO ANY EMPLOYER THAT JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THIS MIGHT. I MIGHT OPT OUT BUT. APPLE GOOGLE FACEBOOK ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO ONE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE HURT BY THIS ALL DEDUCTION IN THIS OR THE ROLL BACK IN THIS OP PRODUCTION AND THIS DIMINISHES OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR. TALENT AND THEN THERE YOU OUT A NEW LINE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE TAX. RETURN THAT WOULD SAY WAGES PAID BY AT WE JUST PAID BY GOLDEN STATE EMPLOYER. AND AND YOU WOULD THAT THERE'D BE A PROGRESSIVE CREDIT FORMULA. AND THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HARD TO DO BY HAND BUT NOT BACK HARD TO DO BY HAND AND I ASSUME MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE USING TURBO TAX OR SOME SORT OF SOFTWARE ACCOUNTANTS. BUT ANYWAY TERMS OF. COMPARING THIS TO THE OTHER CALCULATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE ON YOUR TAX RETURNS CHILD CREDIT PHASE OUT BY ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS THE THIS IS THIS IS PRETTY EASY. AND ANY WOULD OFFSET YOUR TAX LIABILITY BY THAT. IF YOUR IT IN A LOWER MID BRACKET IN CALIFORNIA WOULD MEAN THAT AN YOU ONLY HAVE WHICH INCOME THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU OWE NOTHING TO THE STATE AND HERE. SO PEOPLE WHO ARE EARNING WILL HIGH FIVE DIGIT SALARIES LOW SIX DIGIT SALARIES WOULD STILL PROBABLY PAY NOTHING TO THE ITS STATE AT THE END OF THE YEAR SOME OF THEM I GET A REFUND. YOU COULD MAKE IT A REFUNDABLE. CREDIT. AND THEN I FOLKS AT THE HIGH END WOULD PROBABLY STILL HAVE SOME INCOME THAT BECAUSE OF THE RATE THAT YOU SET FOR THIS NEW ALBUM PAYROLL TAX IF YOU'RE. AYE IF YOU'RE PLAYING FOR THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS IN MAKING MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR YOU WIND UP GETTING THAT THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT RATE OR PINE NOT GONNA HAVE A THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT PAYROLL TAX WILL PICK A LOWER NUMBER THAT'S. CLOSER TO THE EFFECTIVE RATE STATEWIDE FIVE OR SIX SO THEN YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR OTHER OPTIONS IN ORDER TO. OFFSET THAT LAST BIT OF BY STATE TAX LIABILITY SO THAT'S WHEN YOU'D LIKE TO THE CHARITABLE CREDIT THE FOLKS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE CHARITABLE CREDIT ARE GOING TO BE THE TOP TEN PERCENT WHO ARE ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT ITEMIZING DEDUCTIONS BENDIS DOESN'T DO YOU. BY ANYTHING UP FOR YOU I'M SAID THIS IS PEOPLE WITH SALARIES INTO FOR THE MOST PART DOLLARS INTO THE SIX FIGURES. AND THEN ON THE UNRELATED. OR THE UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS TAX WHEN WE THINK OF PASS THROUGHS AND WE THINK OF THE COKE RATHER AS WE THINK OF THESE ASK COURTS WE THINK OF LAW FIRM PARTNERS. I'M BUT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE LOWER DOWN. DE I'M INCOME LADDER AS WELL CERTAINLY THE SHOPKEEPER WHO'S ORGANIZED AS AN LLC BOMB IT IS GOING TO BE THE UBER DRIVER AYE AS WELL WHOSE TIME A SOLE PROPRIETOR. AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE PERSON WHO CONSULTS AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TO ANYONE WHO'S GETTING INCOME THAT'S NOT ON A W. TO. AND SETS UP AYE AS. SO PROPRIETORSHIP OR A PARTNERSHIP RATHER THAN A CORPORATION WOULD BENEFIT FROM. WELL I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THERE IS ALSO A DESIGN ELEMENT TO THIS RIGHT SO THE PAYROLL TAX MEAN. IT COULD SAID IN A DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS WHERE WE HAVE A CHOICE AS TO AS TO HOW WE WANT TO DO IT SO IT IT IS SO IT'S ATTRACTIVE AND THAT IT COULD. IT COULD HELP THE MOST PEOPLE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THERE'S A TENSION BETWEEN HOW MANY PEOPLE IT REACHES ADDRESS ADMINISTRATIVE ARM. FEASIBILITY AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A POLITICAL QUESTION AS TO WHERE YOU WANT TO DRAW THE LINE. YOU KNOW I'D NEW YORK'S IS SETTING IN AT LEAST UNDER THE CURRENT DROPPED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THE THOUGHT IS FOR FOLKS UNDER FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MOST THEIR INCOME IS SHELTERED FROM FEDERAL INCOME TAX BY THE STANDARD DEDUCTION AND BY CHILD TAX CREDITS IN THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. BY AND NEW YORK HAS. STEEPLY GRADUATED RATE STRUCTURES OF THEIR STATE. STATE INCOME TAXES ARE SUBSTANTIAL UP FOR THEM MAKING THEM CALCULATE DISCREDIT THEIR TAX RETURN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE. SAVING THEMSELVES BUT THEN OVER FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IT KICKS IN ARE UNDER NEW YORK'S APPROACH AT SOMETHING LIKE A FIVE PERCENT RATE. BUT TO QUESTIONS THAT. I THINK YOU SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF IF WE WILL THAT ALL THREE OPTIONS WE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING A HUNDRED PERCENT RELIEF ON THE ON THE STATE. TAX SIDE IT IS THERE. BUT BUT YOU DID MENTION THIS SORT OF THE LOCAL TAX SIDE OF SALT. IS THERE A ROLE FOR LOCALITIES TO PLAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE OR MAYBE THEY'RE DOING IT AND AND MAYBE HAS A WAY FOR US TO ENCOURAGE LOCALITIES TO. I'M PRIDE OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS TO PAY THE LOCAL TAXES WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS THAT THAT'S A QUESTION ONE AND THE QUESTION TWO IS IT. IF IF WE REACT. ARMED WITH SOME OF THESE OPTIONS AS OTHER STATES ARE. DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEN REACTED ARE REACTION AND THEN WE JUST SORT OF ARE IN THIS AND THE CYCLE OF TRYING TO GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL. INTENT. THEM LIKE THAT REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL AND EVERYTHING BUT BUT I'M JUST SORT OF. WONDERING IT MEANS THEY CAN JUST ACT AGAIN STATUTORILY RIGHT AND AND CLOSE SOME OF THESE LOOPHOLES HOODIES DESIGNED AROUND SUCH THAT YOU KNOW THE CRAZY BLUE STATES WORKING ON LIKE NEW YORK IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ONE WOULD. IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MIGHT BE ABLE THE. DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS I MEAN THEY HAVE MUCH LESS FLEXIBILITY JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE. BASICALLY THAT THE SALES TAX IN THE. PROPERTY TAX AND. THEY'LL HAVE NO FEES AND OTHER THINGS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AS MANY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW POTENTIAL OPTIONS IS A STATE DOES BUT WE'VE SEEN. PEOPLE IN THE REQUESTED BROUGHT IT BACK TO YOU ON THAT. AND. YEAH HE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BUT. YEAH THEY TENS THE WORKS. TENDS TO WORK SLOWLY MOST THE TIME IT REALLY IT REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY WANT TO GO WITH THAT. TO ADD TWO POINTS FIRST ON ON WHAT YOU COULD DO FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I'M. ALL. I AM I MIGHT RUN INTO A STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM WITH THIS EXPLANATION. BUT I I THINK IT WORKS YOU CAN HAVE A SYSTEM THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE AND. THE CHARITABLE CREDIT IDEA. WHERE WE CREATE SOMETHING CALLED GOLDEN STATE POINTS EVERYONE'S GAGA ABOUT BUT COIN WE NOW HAVE GOLDEN STATE POINTS AND A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CITY BUYS A GOLDEN STATE POINT? UP FROM THE STATE. FOR EIGHTY FIVE CENTS. I AND I'M A DONOR THEN GIVES A DOLLAR TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I AND GETS A GOLDEN STATE GOING BACK. THAT'S WORTH EIGHTY FIVE CENTS. I THAT THEY CAN THEN USE TO OFFSET THEIR STATE TAX LIABILITY THEIR STATE INCOME TAX LIABILITY. BY EIGHTY FIVE SECONDS. I AND THE DONORS BETTER OFF. BECAUSE AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS TO GET STATE TAXES PLUS AT THEIR TOP BRACKET THIRTY SEVEN CENTS. I AM I DEDUCTION THAT THEY OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T BE GETTING SO WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THEM WELL OVER A DOLLAR. AND THE LOCALITIES BETTER OFF BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY BY FROM THE STATE FOR EIGHTY FIVE CENTS SOMETHING THAT IT WAS WORTH A DOLLAR TO THEM THEY GOT A DOLLAR. FROM THE DONOR NEEDED STRUCTURE THE ENTIRE CHARITABLE CREDIT THAT WHY I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY AN ATTRACTIVE WAY ON TO DO IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE. IT TAPS INTO. THAT THE CRYPTO CRAZE. BUT ALSO IT MAKES THE FLOW OF FUNDS NOT GO THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND IT GOES DIRECTLY FROM THE DONOR TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND AND I THINK THE THE ATTRACTION OF THAT I IS I THAT. THE IRS COULD CONCEIVABLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SAY THE ARIZONA PROGRAM AND CALIFORNIA BY SAYING WELL IN ARIZONA THEY'RE PAYING THE SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE STATE IF THE MONEY'S GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND IT LOOKS MORE LIKE. A PAYMENT IN LIEU OF STATE TAXES ON BUT IF YOU DO THIS APPROACH YOUR BENEFITING. LOCALITIES AND I THINK PUTTING YOURSELF ON FIRMER GROUND. FOR FEDERAL LAW PURPOSES BECAUSE THE DOLLARS GOING DIRECTLY FROM THE THE DONOR. TO TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND AND THERE'S REAL ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FIFTEEN CENTS BETTER OFF RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST LEAVING EVERYONE IN THE SAME POSITION AS BEFORE. ON THE SECOND POINT BOMB COULD I COULD THIS ALL GO AWAY WILL LIKELY IT COULD ALL GO WAYS IF IN TWENTY TWENTY AND CONTROL OF. THE. TWO POLITICAL BRANCHES SHIPS AND WE. ROLL BACK THAT I TWENTY SEVENTEEN TAX LAW THEN. YOU'RE NO LONGER DEALING WITH A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP THOUGH ON THE PAYROLL TAX SIDE. BUT YOU WOULD STILL BE BENEFITING THE TWO THIRDS OF YOUR POPULATION THAT UP TILL NOW WASN'T ABLE TO PAY WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS BOND FOR THE SECOND. YOU COULD IMAGINE. A STATUTE I THINK ALL THREE OF US COULD WRITE A STATUTE THAT TARGETED THESE AND THAT WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL. THAT WOULD TIGHTEN MAKE OUR EFFORTS ALL FOR NAUGHT. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STATUTE YOU CAN'T COUNTY TO EIGHTEEN IN THE HOUSE ON THAT BCAUSE IF THERE IS A STATUTE THAT IS DESIGNED TO TAKE AWAY TAX BUT. FROM PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK. AND YOU TAKE AWAY THE CALIFORNIA AND NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THE TAX LAW. THEN IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD FOR. FOR THE HOUSE TO ASSEMBLE A SIMPLE MAJORITY ON THE. I AM CURIOUS IN ARIZONA ABOUT HOW MUCH DOES THE TERRIBLE FUND RAISE A YEAR. IT'S MUCH SMALLER. THEN THEN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING THERE'S NO QUESTION I THINK IT'S. CAPTAIN FIVE HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND DOLLARS NUMBER CONTRIBUTION SOME. OF THESE SO IT'S CAPS YEAH STILL IN YOUR PROJECTIONS HOW MUCH. HAVE USED TO OR HOW MUCH ARE YOU PROJECTING THAT OUR CHARITABLE FUND WOULD MAKE A YEAR I MEAN CONSIDERING THE UNIVERSE THAT IT BENEFITS. WELL I I CERTAINLY. WE KNOW WE'RE NOT ECONOMIST I'M SO I MEAN I'M ON SUCH HOT AND I'M IN A PRETTY. BUT. THE FTV REPORT PROJECTED THAT HE DOES. THE. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE WHICH SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT TO IS AT THE OUTFLOW OF LOSING THE SALT ADOPTION IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE PAST THE AMOUNT. OF. CALIFORNIA DEDUCTIONS LOST. WHETHER THE CHARITABLE. CREDIT PLAN WOULD BRING ALL THAT BACK I MEAN I I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW AS DANIEL EXPLAINED IT WOULD DO THAT BY DESIGN BUT IT COULD BE A GIVE IT COULD BE ON THE ORDER OF SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS FOR SURE. WEEKS WHEN YOU SAY THERE'S FIFTEEN SEE SAID THERE'S FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION LOSS BILLION BILLION LOST. INDEED ACTIONS THAT IS ACROSS THE BORDER AND THAT IS JUST THE UNIVERSE THAT WE ARE THINKING WOULD USE THAT CHARITABLE DONATION. THAT ISSUED WHAT THE F. TO BE CALCULATED FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR THE TOTAL TAXPAYERS. HOW MUCH THEY LOST IN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LOST IN THEIR DEDUCTION IS WITH THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS? OKAY. AND THEN ON THE REPATRIATION TAX THAT TWO POINT SIX TRILLION. THERE WERE NOT TAX AND. WHAT KIND WAIT WHAT DO YOU WHAT IT KIND OF AYE? SUGGESTIONS TO HAVE ON THAT SORT OF ON TAXING THAT. REPATRIATION MONEY FOR CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE LOSS FOR US. YES WELL I WOULD. PROPOSE. NOT. TINKERING WITH. CURRENT CORPORATE INCOME TAX ITS FEET ITS IT THAT JUST HAVE A SORT OF A STANDALONE HAVE A STANDALONE PROVISION THAT SAYS. THAT THIS TEAM TO REAP SOME PORTION OF THE STEAM REPATRIATION WAS OUT IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO APPLY A REASONABLE APPORTIONMENT FORMULA IN ORDER TO PREVENT THAT WHEN NOT. DOUBLE TAXING IT RELATIVE TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES. AND THOSE FORMULAS ARE. EVALUATED BY COURTS DIFFERENTIALLY. AS FOR BEING REASONABLE TOWARDS WHAT I THINK A REASONABLE FORMULA MIGHT BE. HERE'S ONE IDEA IF YOU COULD SAY WELL IT'S TWO POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS EARNED OVER. THE OF DECADES. ALL OVER THE WORLD. SOME PORTION OF IT WAS EARNED IN THE U. S. LET'S SAY. BY PEOPLE DO A BY U. S. GDP SO TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY PERCENT. AND THE LAST. AND THEN OF THAT AMOUNT THAT WAS EARLY IN THE U. S. A CERTAIN AMOUNT WAS OWNED IN CALIFORNIA CAN WILL DO A ROUGH CUT WILL SAY. NO TEN TWELVE PERCENT BY CALIFORNIA GDP RIGHT SO IF YOU DO THAT THOSE NUMBERS THEN IT'S NO IT'S STILL A LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME OF MONEY. WITH AND BE. A PORTION OF ALL TO CALIFORNIA AND THEN CALIFORNIA COULD THEN APPLY EITHER ITS REGULAR IT CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF EIGHT POINT EIGHT FOUR PERCENT. OR THEORETICALLY COULD SAY WILL KEY WILL DO A POINT A FOUR PERCENT PLUS. TWO PERCENT PENALTY BECAUSE REALLY YOU SHOULD OF LUCID GOT MISS MONEY YEARS AGO SO ATTRACT INTEREST NOW. ANY ADDITIONAL RATE OVER THE REGULAR RATE. WOULD. I'M EACH BE AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE THAT THE BUT THE RULE IS YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST FOREIGN INCOME AND SO YOU'D OR ANY UP AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT THAT THIS INCOME WAS EARNED ABROAD DAN HAPPY TO HIRE IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM AGAIN. ON THIS CONCEPTUAL STATION IT WOULD BE INCOME I'M EARNED DOMESTICALLY. SO. BASIC IDEA. HAVE A SEPARATE STATUTE SPECIAL APPORTIONMENT FORMULA YOU CAN APPLY AT LEAST YOUR REGULAR CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE. HE PROBABLY ALSO SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF PROVISION. I'M FOR PETITIONS FOR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO FOR INSTANCE. UP CERTAIN CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA SAYS WE'RE GONNA TAX YOU ON ALL OF YOUR WORLDWIDE INCOME. SO THERE COULD BE CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE THEORETICALLY PAY TAX ON THIS INCOME ALREADY AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY TAX ON IT TO GET. NOW. WHY WHY PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT'S NOT TRUE POST BECAUSE? YOU CAN TAKE A WATERSHED ELECTION WHICH IS TO SAY THAT IF YOU'RE A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION EARNS LOTS OF MONEY ABROAD YOU CAN CHOOSE TO ONLY BE TAXED ON YOU YOU S. AND. SO I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT FAKE ONLINE CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE ALL THIS MONEY ABROAD TOOK THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTIONS. AND THEREFORE DID NOT PAY TAX. ON THAT IT UP BUT IT'S DEFINITELY HAS TO BE A PROVISION FOR THAT ARE IN THE LAW. I'M COMMITTEE I'M SOME KIND OF OF. PROCEDURE I'M IN CASE THE INCOMES BUT TAXED ALREADY. I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL BUT THAT'S THE. JUST ABOUT. THAT HELPS WELL I I THINK OF HOW UNHAPPY TO A. IT CAN THE IRISH AT THE SOUND BY RIGHT I REGULATION. IT I THINK IT VARIES FROM. FROM PLAN TO PLAN. ON THE ON THE PAYROLL TAX. THE IDEA THAT. EMPLOYER PAID PAYROLL TAXES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN EMPLOYEE GROSS INCOME. GOES WAY BACK RIGHT I MEAN IT GOES BACK TO NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE. WERE AND. FOR EVERY A HUNDRED DOLLARS I EARNED SIX DOLLARS TWENTY CENTS IS PAID BY MY EMPLOYER. IN. OASDI IN SOCIAL SECURITY AYE NO ONE THINKS THAT I SHOULD REALLY BE TAXED ON A HUNDRED AND SIX DOLLARS AND. FOR THAT. AND AND WE HAVE. THE YEARS OF EMPLOYER SIDE PAYROLL TAXES FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DC HAS DONE THIS FOR. FOR PAY WE PAID LEAVE AT NEW YORK'S DOES THIS TO FIND I'M. ITS MTI ADDS A AYE METRO TRANSIT AUTHORITY AND AND. UNSETTLING THAT WOULD BE A I THINK DIFFICULT. AND IT WOULD. BE DOING IT BY REGULATION WOULD. RAISE A LOT OF RISK FOR. FOR THE IRS AND COULD THEY DO IT YEAH I GUESS THEY COULD PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AND THEN WAIT FOR IT TO BE CHALLENGE IN COURT BUT THIS WOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE. AND THE CHALLENGE IN COURT AND I WOULD BET ON THE TAXPAYERS. ON THE CHARITABLE CREDITS. IT IS. I THINK SO STUDENT WHATWERE LARGELY GOING ON HERE'S A CHIEF COUNSEL ADVICE MEMORANDUM FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT WAS ADDRESSING THE MISSOURI I CREDIT SCHEME. AND. WHICH I I CHIEF COUNSEL ADVICE MEMORANDUM HAS YOU KNOW PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TAXPAYERS LOOK TO IT LOOK TO THESE ALL THE TIME BUT THE IRS COULD BY REGULATION. GO BACK ON. AND I THINK THERE ARE. CHIU DOWNSIDES OF THAT FROM THIRD CHIU. POTENTIAL ICEBERGS OF THE IRIS IT. ONE. YOU'D BE ARE CATCHING IN THE IN THE CROSS HAIRS ALL WHOLE BUNCH OF RED STATE PROGRAMS. THAT ARE VERY POLITICALLY POPULAR AMONG. SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BASE RIGHT AT THE THAT I ARIZONA PROGRAM IS POPULAR LARGELY BECAUSE ITS FIRST AMENDMENT ARBITRAGE NOT TAX. NOT WASN'T INITIALLY TAX MOTIVATED BUT THEY'RE REAL TAX BENEFITS THAT MANY IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADVERTISEMENTS AT THE ARIZONA SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATIONS. MAKE IT BAD TAXES A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS SO ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE FLOW OF FUNDS GO FROM DONOR TO AN ENTITY OTHER THAN THE GENERAL FUND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO WRITE A REGULATION THAT KILLS THAT. THAT DOESN'T KILL A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROGRAMS THAT. AB THE IRS CHIEF COUNSEL WOULD BE HAPPY TO HILL AYE KILL BUT WILL BE AYE GETTING SECRETARY OF TREASURY BY AND. AS HE NEEDS TO FOR AND. REGULATION OUT WILL BE A LOT HARDER SECOND THERE'S A SUPREME COURT CASE RANDALL VERSUS LAS GOTTEN FROM I THINK IT'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT. IS ABOUT ACTUALLY A SECURITIES LAW ISSUE. I AND THERE IS A LINE IN IT. I. AND IT'S KIND OF A THROWAWAY LINE BUT IT'S IN A SUPREME COURT OPINION. AND THAT SAYS WE WILL NOT ASSUME THAT A CREDIT. AYE IS PART OF GROSS INCOME FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION SIXTY ONE OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE UNLESS CONGRESS HAS CLEARLY INDICATED THAT IT OUGHT TO BE. AND AND YEAH IT'S IN THE SUPREME COURT COULD GO BACK ON THAT. BUT YOU CAN'T BY REGULATION ON DO SOMETHING THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID AND YOU BET THAT IF THE IRS PROMULGATES REGULATIONS. BUT THAT ARE TRYING TO SHUT DOWN THESE. NASCENT TERRIBLE CREDIT SCHEMES ARE NOT SCHEMES CHARITABLE CREDIT. THAT. I USE THE WORD SCHEME IN A. WITHOUT ANY PEJORATIVE SENSE. DEDUCTION PHYLLIS IT IF IT GOT DEDUCTION FACILITATION STRATEGY. AND THAT THAT THAT SUPREME COURT LANGUAGE WILL BE. THROWN AROUND AND AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE OF JUSTICE KENNEDY'S OPINION IN THE ARIZONA SCHOOL TUITION AYE CASE BUT AGAIN IT WASN'T QUITE ON POINT IT WAS REALLY ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT. BUT SUPREME COURT DIPPED I CAN GET IN THE WAY OF THE TREASURY REGULATION. AND. SO SO THE UPSHOT IS THAT THERE DEFINITELY IS ARRESTED. AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE LEGISLATION THAT COMES OUT BEING A STRONG. AS POSSIBLE. AND THAT. GET THAT THERE IS A. A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. HOW STRONG WE MAKE THE? BILL OR. AND HOW LIKELY IRIS ACTION IS RIGHT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE MAKE THE BILL HAVE. FIELD BY DESIGN A LOT OF SUBSTANCE RIGHT AS WE IMAGINING HOW I'M CERTAIN TAXPAYERS ARE FINANCING GOVERNMENT THE STRONGER OUR POSITION IS UMP CANNOT BE CHALLENGED. AND THEN I WILL ASK QUESTIONS SO IF THERE IS LONG TERM FEDERAL LEVEL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. INVESTMENT LEAST PROJECT WILL GO DOWN WHICH OF THESE WHEN I COME HOME SCHEMES WE KNOW WHICH OF THESE IDEAS WHICH PAYROLL TAX CONTRIBUTION WHICH WHICH ONE WILL ACTUALLY. BE THAT HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO OFFSET. THAT BUT INVESTMENT GOING DOWN. IN TERMS OF GENERATING REVENUE FOR THE STATE. I GUESS. I WOULD BE INCLINED TO SAY THAT. WHAT THE STRATEGIES ARE STRUCTURED TO DO IS O ENABLE? THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO SNOOZE FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS IT'S BEEN SPENDING. PREVIOUSLY. AND THAT DAY AS DANIEL EXPLAINED ARE ALL COMPLIMENTARY. AND THAT IT'S UNCLEAR CLEAR ESPECIALLY WE DON'T KNOW THE UPTAKE OF THE CHARITABLE DEDUCTION THING WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE IRIS WILL APPROACH IT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LIMIT WILL BE PUT THE PAYROLL TAX IT IF IT'S VOLUNTARY HOW WHAT THE UPTAKE WILL BE THERE SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE DON'T KNOW BUT IT. THEN ASKED WE WILL END UP WHERE WE WERE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RIGHT IN TERMS OF. HOW MUCH OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IS FUNDED WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS TO THE EXTENT THAT SAY? THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR HIT BECAUSE OF ADDITIONAL OBAMACARE REPEAL ALL OF WHICH TO DO WHICH IS KIND AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING LOGISTICS MONTHS AGO. AND NONE OF THESE STRATEGIES THEMSELVES WILL MITIGATE THAT. HOWEVER. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THEM HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HELP MITIGATE SO AGAIN THAT'S WHY I SIGNALED WHILE. HE OF THE PAYROLL TAX IS IMPOSED AND THE CREDIT IS NINETY PERCENT. BIDAK COULD GENERATE TEN PERCENT CREDITS TOWARDS A MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF THEIR NAM OBAMACARE. I'M FOR INSTANCE SO THAT TOOK THAT SO I DON'T THINK IT. ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS WOULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUE BUT MAYBE IT COULD SET THE SUPERSTRUCTURE. FORD FOR OTHER KINDS BECAUSE I I'LL SHIP YOU KNOW. JUST RETURN TO SOMETHING THAT DAVID IS HEARD ME SAY MANY TIMES CREATURES THAT THE CALIFORNIA. SPACE SICK TAX SYSTEM HASN'T CHANGED SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. TERMS OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX CORPORATE INCOME TAX STRUCTURE OF THIS TAX I'M EXCEPT FOR THE VARIOUS PROPERTY TAX LIMITATIONS ON SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A STATE OF THE ART TWENTIETH CENTURY. RIGHT MUCH LESS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO IF THIS SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM WERE TO SORT OF MOTIVATE US TO THINK ALONG THOSE LINES THAT WOULD BE. YOU KNOW IT MAKE LEMONADE. I CAN I JUMP IN ON ON THAT SO OF THE THREE IF IT'S WHICH WILL. WHICH WILL DO THE MOST RAISE REVENUE FOR. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN VOTE ONE OFF THE ISLAND IMMEDIATELY THE UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS TAX IS A SMALLER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE BECAUSE MOST INCOME THERE'S MUCH MORE WAGE INCOME THAN THERE IS. PASS THROUGH INCOME IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES. AND I THINK THE PAYROLL TAX DOES MORE TO FACILITATE PAYMENT OF. STATE TAXES WITH BUT WE DEDUCTIBLES OPTICS RIGHT BECAUSE IT AFFECTS A HUNDRED PERCENT OR IT AFFECTS ALL WORKERS RATHER THAN JUST THE TEN PERCENT. OF ITEMIZE YEARS AND AT LAST IT STILL HELPS THEM BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EVEN IF EVERYTHING PHASES OUT. I'M AND THEIR REASONS WHY WOULD WANT TO HELP PEOPLE BE ON TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EVEN IF EVERYTHING FACES OUT BECAUSE THE ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T COME BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE RIGHT THROUGH THE FEDERAL SPENDING CUTS HAVE TO HAPPEN SOMETIME I AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ALL. GOING TO HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE. BEARING A LARGER. BURDEN AS A RESULT IF IT'S ACTION IS IT SHOULD AND THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT INCREASES IN STATE LEVEL TAXES BECAUSE THE AFTER TAX PRICE TO THEM IS LOWER THAN IT WOULD BE WITHOUT. IF IT'S ABOUT DIRECTLY MAKING MONEY FOR OUR THE STATE GENERAL FUND BUT I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT WITH A TERRIBLE CREDIT. I AND YOU CAN DO IT IN A THE FOLLOWING WHY SAID THIS IS I'M. LET'S IMAGINE LET'S GO BACK FOR A GOLDEN STATE POINTS. AND LET'S SAY THAT BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BUYS GOLDEN STATE POINT IN THIS. OR IT COULD REALLY BE ANY CHARITY BUYS GOLDEN STATE COINS FROM CALIFORNIA FROM THE STATE FOR AYE NINETY CENTS. SO. WE WE COULD WE DEPEND IT'S A PRIVATE SCHOOL STANFORD UNIVERSITY PAYS NINETY SET. TO CALIFORNIA FOR ECOLOGICAL. I. AND THEN. CAN SOMEONE GIVES A DOLLAR TO STANFORD. AND THEN. STANFORD GIVES A GOLDEN STATE COIN. YOU KNOW GIVES US A MUG AND A GOLD STATE COURT. OR TWO. AND AND THE THE TAXPAYER THEN USES THE GOLDEN STATE CORNING TO OFFSET STATE LOCAL INCOME. I AND WE SAY THEY CAN DO THAT EIGHTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR THERE'S STILL HAPPY BECAUSE THEY'VE PAID A DOLLAR FOR SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH EIGHTY CENTS BUT EIGHTY CENTS. WHAT'S THE THIRTY SEVEN SENT FEDERAL DEDUCTION THEY'RE STILL ABOUT THE DOLLAR STANFORD'S HAPPY BECAUSE IT PAID NINETY CENTS TO THE STATE FOR THIS GOLDEN STATE COIN AND THEN GOT A DOLLAR. FROM THE DONOR. UP WITH THE GENERAL FUNDS ACTUALLY BETTER OFF TO. BECAUSE THE GENERAL FUND SOLD TO SANFORD STANFORD THIS GOLDEN STATE POINT FOR NINETY CENTS POT AND THEN ONLY GAVE THE PERSON EIGHTY CENTS OF CREDIT. ON. ONCE IN INCOME TAXES IT'S ARE YOU CAN DO THIS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOU CAN DO THIS FOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO IT FOR ANY FIVE ONE C. THREE ORGANIZATION. IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN YOU COULD RAISE A LOT OF REVENUE. AND IT'S IT'S IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY I MEAN IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE IF WE GO BACK TO A WORLD IN WHICH YOU'RE GETTING THE SAME DEDUCTION FOR STATE LOCAL TAXES. AS YOU'RE GETTING FOR TERRIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND THERE'S NOT MUCH OF AN INCENTIVE I TO DO THIS AND A FEW ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX PAYERS WHO CLAIM THE GENERAL CONTRIBUTION DEDUCTION BUT NOT THE STATE LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. ARE PROBABLY NOT A LARGE ENOUGH OR OR DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEIR IN THAT POOL AND BUT YOU HAVE A LIKE A FLEETING REVENUE OPPORTUNITY THAT COULD BE I MEAN IF YOU THINK OF ALL THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT FLOW TO FIVE ONE C. THREES I IN CALIFORNIA. ON TOP OF THE NOT GOING TO. SCHOOL DISTRICT STATE AGENCIES THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND I THOUGHT I WAS MY LAST QUESTION I ONE MORE QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE ANY. BESIDES THAT NATURAL INCLINATION FOR SOME COMPANIES WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO GET FOLKS FROM OTHER STATES FOR THE PAYROLL TAX. INCENTIVE. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS ON INCENTIVIZING BUSINESSES TO UTILIZE IT. I. SEE YOU COULD MAKE. A CERTAIN CREDITS AVAILABLE TO BUSINESSES IF THERE ARE IF THERE GOLDEN STATE. GOLDEN STATE WORKS EMPLOYERS. AND NOT IF THEY'RE NOT AND YOU COULD ALLOW THEM TO CLAIM STATE ARE DE CREDITS IF THEY ARE BUT NOT IF THEY'RE. YOU COULD HAVE. YOU COULD MODEST LEAVE REDUCE THEIR CORPORATE TAX RATE. I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S. OR POINT ONE PERCENTAGE POINTS OUT MATTERS. TO. A LOT OF EMPLOYERS I'M YOU COULD RELIEVE THEM FROM. WHATEVER REGULATORY REQUIREMENT MOST. ANGERS EMPLOYERS. IN CALIFORNIA I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR THAT REQUIREMENTS SO. SO PROBABLY WHEN DO THAT BUT ACTUALLY THE PROGRAM IS EVEN BETTER IF THERE ARE LEGAL DIFFERENCES OTHER THAN THE PAYROLL TAX DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN GOLDEN STATE WORKS EMPLOYERS AND OTHER EMPLOYERS A CAN BE FAVORABLE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE IRS CHALLENGES THIS BILL LIKELY ARGUMENT IS GOING TO BE WELL I THERE'S NO REASON TO BECOME A GOLDEN STATE WORKS EMPLOYER OTHER THAN TO REDUCE FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY IF YOU CAN SAY ACTUALLY NO THERE ARE OTHER REASONS TO BECOME A GOLDEN STATE. WORKS EMPLOYER THERE IS ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE. TO THIS THEN NOT ONLY DO YOU GOT MORE BY AND. IF THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE ARE POSITIVE DIFFERENCES REASONS WHY YOU WOULD WANT EAGLE THE STATE WORKS I EMPLOYER BUT YOU PUT YOURSELF ON. MORE SALT LEGAL FOOTING. I WOULD THINK THE THREE OF YOU THINK YOU FOR YOUR. TO HAVE ANY PUBLIC ON THEIR QUESTIONS. NO SEEING AND. THEN SEEING NONE. I THINK YOU'LL FAIR COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW I APPRECIATE IT AND IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE THOSE WHO ARE HERE AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING. I THINK YOU FOUGHT FOR ALL BEING HERE. BOTH PROFESSORS AND THE LA OFFICE. WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR BECAUSE IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL BRIEFING
