01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:22.750
SO THEY CLOSED EMERGENCY

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:23.350
DEPARTMENT DOWN SO THEY CAN

HOSPITAL SO THIS BILL IS NOT

PROBLEM IS SOMEWHERE ELSE THE

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:33.427
PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE USING OUR

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:36.230

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:38.899
THE ROOM FOR THE PRIMARY CARE.

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:41.135
AND WHEN YOU GO TO AN EMERGENCY

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:42.136

PROBLEM AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:05.292
WE NEED TO DRESS. THIS BILL IS

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:08.195

HOUSE WAS BURNED DOWN. AND I

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:44.751
THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE VITAL

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:47.154
ROLE THAT MERGES ROOM PLAYS IN

A DISTRICT THAT HAS ABOUT 75%

01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:14.788
OF THE STATE'S OIL IS PRODUCED

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:16.790
FOR CALIFORNIANS AND SO I THINK

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:17.858
WHEN I GET UP AND SPEAK ABOUT

01:48:17.924 --> 01:48:19.092
OIL PEOPLE THINK IT'S SELF

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:20.861
CENTERED OR SELF SERVING

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:22.896
BECAUSE MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:25.665
THRIVES ON AN ECONOMY THAT'S

01:48:25.732 --> 01:48:28.969
OIL DRIVEN BUT DOING SOME DATA

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:31.204
RESEARCH HIGH FOUND OUT. THAT

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:32.772
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:34.975
ACTUALLY REDUCED THE PERMITS

01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:36.509
REQUIRED FOR DRILLING AND

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:38.712
CONSERVE OIL PRODUCTION. IS

01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:40.780
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY DOWN

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:42.449
EIGHTY PER OR SEES ME 40% SINCE

01:48:42.515 --> 01:48:43.850
NINETEEN EIGHTY. BUT THE

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:45.752
CONSUMPTION RATE FOR

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:46.987
CALIFORNIANS HAS GONE UP OVER

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:49.456
TWENTY TWO PERCENT. AND SO WHEN

01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:50.490
YOU THINK IF YOU'RE NT

01:48:50.557 --> 01:48:51.958
DRILLING FOR OIL IN PRODUCING

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:53.627
OIL INTO THE GREATEST MOST

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:55.695
ENVIRONMENTALLY STRICT.

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:58.098
REGULATORY PROCESSES IN WHERE

01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:59.532
DOES THE OIL COME FROM THAT WE

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:00.367
CALIFORNIANS IN ALL OF OUR

01:49:00.433 --> 01:49:02.502

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:05.171
FROM IRAQ ECUADOR IN SAUDI

01:49:08.808 --> 01:49:10.510
INTO OUR COAST THE SAN

01:49:26.459 --> 01:49:27.727
THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN

01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:29.629

ESCORT. WE DON'T ACTUALLY FUNDS

01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:42.876

OIL PRODUCTION HERE IN THE

STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:58.358
INCREASED CONSUMPTION AS

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:20.880
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WAGES

01:50:20.947 --> 01:50:23.316
ANYTHING THIS BILL PARTICULARLY

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:26.086
WILL RESTRICT SOME OF THAT AND

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:27.454
TO LOOK AT AN AGENCY THAT IS

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.155
INDUSTRY FUNDED DOCTOR IS

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:31.324
COMPLETELY FUNDED BY THE OIL

01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:34.327
INDUSTRY. VIA S. SURCHARGE THIS

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:37.864
ISSUE TO THEM. IT'S HAVE

01:50:37.931 --> 01:50:39.566
ACTUALLY GONE DOWN IN THE STATE

01:50:39.632 --> 01:50:41.534
OF CALIFORNIA THE FOR

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.036
HARVESTING OR FOR GATHERING OR

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:45.105
PRODUCING OIL WHERE THE PERMITS

01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:46.940
HAVE GONE UP IS BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:47.007 --> 01:50:47.807
BILL THAT WAS PASSED A COUPLE

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:49.909
OF YEARS AGO THAT REQUIRES DOT

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:52.445
OIL COMPANIES TO ABANDON WELLS.

01:50:52.512 --> 01:50:53.613
AND SO THEY HAVE TO PULL A

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.248
PERMIT TO ABANDON WELLS AND

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:55.915
BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:57.183
WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR MONTH

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:58.885
PERIOD. AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE

01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:01.154
PERMIT INCREASE HAS TAKEN PLACE

01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:02.589
IT'S NOT A NEW PRODUCTION OR

01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:04.391
WELL STIMULATION THOUGH STILL

01:51:04.457 --> 01:51:06.226
AVERAGE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

01:51:06.292 --> 01:51:08.395
TWELVE PERMITS A YEAR AGAIN

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:09.396
PRODUCING OIL UNDER THE

01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:10.230
STRICTEST ENVIRONMENTAL

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:12.966

WORLD I WOULD THINK AND AGAIN I

01:51:15.668 --> 01:51:16.669
WOULD JUST CHALLENGE YOU TO

01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:17.837
THINK ABOUT WHERE OUR OIL COMES

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:19.139
FROM WHEN WE DON'T PRODUCE IT

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:21.474
HERE CREATE JOBS HERE AND KEEP

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.109
THAT HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION

01:51:23.176 --> 01:51:26.279
DOLLARS. OF MANY THAT WE EXPORT

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.147
TO THESE OTHER COUNTRIES I

01:51:27.213 --> 01:51:29.015
WOULD CHALLENGE YOU GUYS TO

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.383
DEFINITELY THINK ABOUT WHERE

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:31.851
OIL IS PRODUCED BECAUSE

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:33.019
CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOT REDUCE

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:36.790
THE CONSUMPTION OF OIL IN ANY

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:37.357
WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO I WOULD

LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AS IT

01:52:12.525 --> 01:52:12.992
AS IT RELATES TO CLIMATE

AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. THIS

01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:33.353
BILL IS A PRETTY TECHNICAL AND

01:56:33.419 --> 01:56:35.221
MODEST MEASURE THERE WILL BE

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:36.622
TIME I THINK FOR A BROADER

01:56:36.689 --> 01:56:38.991
DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OIL

01:56:39.058 --> 01:56:40.426

GOOD PREVIEW OF AN IMPORTANT

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.179
FUTURE DEBATE BUT I WOULD JUST

01:57:00.246 --> 01:57:00.913
ADMIT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:03.816
THIS VEHICLE IS THE PLACE FOR

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:18.398
SOME TOOL TO DO THAT SO. JUST

01:57:18.464 --> 01:57:21.267
WANTED TO PUT THAT PLUG IN AND

01:57:21.334 --> 01:57:22.869

01:57:49.061 --> 01:57:50.630
CHRIS MY CREATE SOME CONCERN MY

01:57:50.696 --> 01:57:52.231
ANTENNAE GO UP WHEN I WHEN I

01:57:52.298 --> 01:57:54.700
HEAR ABOUT INVOLVING AUTHORITY

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:55.301
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:57.970
HERE IS A SERIES OF WHAT

01:57:58.037 --> 01:58:00.573
APPEARED TO BE BEEN NINE

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.308
EVOLUTIONS IN WORKPLACE

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:04.510
PROTECTION BUT IN THE TOTALITY

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:06.512
OF CIRCUMSTANCES YOU HAVE A

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:09.782
DEPRESSION IN THE MARKETPLACE

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:12.351
ITSELF ANNA WITH ALL DUE

01:58:12.418 --> 01:58:13.386
RESPECT TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:14.987
MADE EARLIER I THINK IN ITS IT

01:58:15.054 --> 01:58:16.222
WITH THE TOTALITY OF SO WITHIN

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:18.124
A TO TELL THE OF CIRCUMSTANCES

01:58:18.191 --> 01:58:21.594
WE'RE LOOKING AT AN INDUSTRY.

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:24.497
THAT IS BEING PENALIZED.

01:58:24.564 --> 01:58:24.997
ANNUALLY IN EVERY SINGLE

01:58:25.064 --> 01:58:27.633
RESPECT. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.635
IN IN MY MIND GIVEN THAT WE

01:58:29.702 --> 01:58:30.169
HAVE THE SOME OF THE BEST

01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:32.939
WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS WITHIN

01:58:33.005 --> 01:58:34.974
THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:38.077
CERTAINLY ACROSS THE GLOBE BUT

01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:40.379
YET WE STILL BRING IN THE

01:58:40.446 --> 01:58:42.548
FOSSIL FUELS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:43.583
OUR ECONOMY AND OUR WAY OF

01:58:43.649 --> 01:58:46.319
LIFE. SORE PENALIZING THE FEW

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:48.654
INDUSTRY PLAYERS THAT REMAINING

01:58:48.721 --> 01:58:52.391
CALIFORNIA AND ARE EXPORTING

01:58:52.458 --> 01:58:55.228
WHAT I THINK IS A IS A LARGER

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:57.230
IS A LARGER AGENDA TO GET AWAY

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:59.432
FROM THAT BUT REALITY IS WE'RE

01:58:59.499 --> 01:59:00.933
NOT READY TO COMPLETELY GET

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.302
AWAY FROM IT WE'RE MOVING IN

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:04.203
THAT DIRECTION NO DOUBT BUT IT

01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:06.105
WON'T BE ELIMINATED. SO I GUESS

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:08.307
MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN WE GO

01:59:08.374 --> 01:59:11.410
AHEAD AND CONTINUE TO ADD MORE

01:59:11.477 --> 01:59:13.045
BURDENSOME REGULATIONS INTO AN

01:59:13.112 --> 01:59:16.015
ON ON TO AN INDUSTRY IT REALLY

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:21.754
IS FOR. IT REALLY IS. TO HURT

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:22.855
US LONG TERM AND THAT'S WHAT

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:24.056
I'M WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:26.092
AND FOR THOSE THAT THAT BELIEVE

01:59:26.158 --> 01:59:28.661
THAT THIS IS JUST A BIT NINE.

01:59:28.728 --> 01:59:30.129
DISCUSSION POINT OR ITS

01:59:30.196 --> 01:59:32.999
DISCREET IN ITS APPLICATION.

01:59:33.065 --> 01:59:33.766
TROUBLED APPRECIATED IN THE

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:35.601
LARGER CONTEXT IT'S NOT IT'S

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:38.404
KILLING IN INDUSTRY ON WHICH WE

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:41.340
RELY ECONOMICALLY END FOR

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:45.478
OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. I

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:46.012
WOULD CERTAINLY CERTAINLY

01:59:46.078 --> 01:59:50.483
SUPPORT A NO VOTE. CENTER STONE.

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:52.251
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IN

01:59:52.785 --> 01:59:55.421
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. THAT

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:57.590
SOME MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HAVE

01:59:57.657 --> 01:59:58.824
WHEN THEY SEE BILLS LIKE THIS

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.826
BECAUSE OF MAKE NO MISTAKE

02:00:00.893 --> 02:00:02.461
ABOUT IT THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS

02:00:02.528 --> 02:00:03.429
OF THIS LEGISLATURE THIS SEED

02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:06.265
OIL AS THE ENEMY. TO OUR STATE

02:00:06.332 --> 02:00:08.768
AND TO OUR COUNTRY AND TO

02:00:08.834 --> 02:00:12.238
CLIMATE CHANGE. AND YOU KNOW IF

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:16.509
WE COULD CHANGE FROM. OIL COM

02:00:16.576 --> 02:00:18.911
THE CONSUMPTION TO ALTERNATIVE

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:20.479
FORMS OF ENERGY IN THE NEXT

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:23.382
THREE OR FOUR YEARS OR THE NEXT

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:23.916
TWELVE AS SOME DEMOCRATIC

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:25.651
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CLAIM

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:27.820
THAT WE CAN DO WE COULD BE

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:29.922
HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT- YOU

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:30.523
KNOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:35.928
HISTORY. WE ARE AN OIL EXPORTER.

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:38.531
WE'RE NOT A NET OIL IMPORTER MY

02:00:38.598 --> 02:00:38.965
FRIENDS WE NEED SOME

02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:42.969
COMPETITION. BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:44.437
MANY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:45.571
ESPECIALLY MIND THAT ARE BLUE

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:47.473
COLLAR WORKERS THAT HAVE TO BUY

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:49.175
GAS TO GET TO AND FROM THEIR

02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:51.143
WORKPLACES SOME OF YOU LIVE IN

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:53.679
COASTAL COMMUNITIES WERE.

02:00:53.746 --> 02:00:55.681
GASOLINE PRICES ARE NOT A BIG

02:00:55.748 --> 02:00:56.282
ISSUE. THE GASOLINE PRICES ARE

02:00:56.349 --> 02:00:59.151
BIG ISSUE. IN MY COMMUNITY

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:00.019
WHERE I HAVE BLUE COLLAR

02:01:00.086 --> 02:01:02.188
WORKERS A SOMETIMES DRIVE OVER

02:01:02.254 --> 02:01:02.755
A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ROUND

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:05.157
TRIP TO GO TO WORK. I SEE YOUR

02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:07.259
CITIZENS HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:07.860
BUYING GASOLINE BUYING FOOD TO

02:01:07.927 --> 02:01:10.162
BUY MEDICINE. SO THE

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:11.631
COMPETITION THAT WE HAVE IS

02:01:11.697 --> 02:01:14.367
BEING A NET OIL EXPORTER. AND

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:16.535
UTILIZING THE NATURAL RESOURCE

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:17.737

02:01:17.803 --> 02:01:19.839
UNITED STATES. HAS BEEN A VERY

02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:21.007
POSITIVE THING IT'S VERY

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:22.808
UPSETTING TO ME WHEN I SEE

02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:31.651
AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A GALLON.

02:01:31.717 --> 02:01:35.087
AND WHERE ARE WE- WE'RE STILL

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:38.224
IN THE FORMS CLOSER TO FIVE

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:38.824
DOLLARS A GALLON DEPENDING ON

02:01:38.891 --> 02:01:41.627
THE TIME OF YEAR THAT YOU.

INDUSTRY. ON THE MORE ONEROUS

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:00.980
IT IS AND MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS

02:02:01.047 --> 02:02:04.350
FOR THEM TO EXIST. NOT ONLY IN

02:02:04.417 --> 02:02:04.984

CONCERNS I THINK. OF THE AUTHOR

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:14.919
OF THIS BILL. OZ HEART IN THERE

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:15.620
IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE WE'VE

02:28:15.686 --> 02:28:18.155
SEEN. WE SEE WORKPLACE

02:28:18.222 --> 02:28:20.958
HARASSMENT AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN

02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:22.893
WITH CONTRACTORS IN CONTRACT

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:26.664
DIS. SO WE KNOW IT EXISTS. BUT

02:28:26.731 --> 02:28:29.767
THERE'S ALSO A PRINCIPLE IN LAW.

02:28:29.834 --> 02:28:30.368
AND IT IS KNOWN OR SHOULD HAVE

02:28:30.434 --> 02:28:33.304
KNOWN. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF AN

02:28:33.371 --> 02:28:34.972
EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:38.109
OR WITH CONTRACT DIS. I BELIEVE

02:28:38.175 --> 02:28:40.044
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PROPER

02:28:40.111 --> 02:28:42.113
VETTING IF THERE'S AN EMPLOYER

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:45.283
OR A CONTRACTOR DEALING WITH

02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:48.286
CONTRACT THESE TO DO THERE ARE

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:49.487
TO DO THEIR BEST TO DEVELOP

02:28:49.553 --> 02:28:51.455
THOSE CANDIDATES. AND IN A

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:54.425
SCENARIO THAT THAT THAT THE NEW

02:28:54.492 --> 02:28:54.959
OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS

02:28:55.026 --> 02:28:56.594
INDIVIDUAL POSED A RISK. BUT I

02:28:56.661 --> 02:28:58.996
THINK THIS MIGHT BE GOING IN.

02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:01.732
IN UNINTENDED DIRECTION AS WELL

02:29:01.799 --> 02:29:02.166
IS THAT WE COULD BE

02:29:02.233 --> 02:29:06.404
DISCOURAGING. BUSINESSES FROM

02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:08.372
HIRING CONTRACTORS IN WORKING

02:29:08.439 --> 02:29:11.809
WITH CONTRACT DIS. EVERYTHING

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:13.277
EVERYTHING IS BEING BROUGHT IN

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:14.679
HOUSE I THINK WITH THIS

02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:17.048
LEGISLATION IT'S DISCOURAGING

02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:18.749
EMPLOYERS FROM REACHING OUT

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:21.352
INTO INTO THE COMMUNITY AND IN

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:22.953
HIRING FOLKS THAT ARE NOT

02:29:23.020 --> 02:29:24.922
NECESSARILY IN IN THE HOUSE OR

02:29:24.989 --> 02:29:26.957
IN THE SHOP IN SO I THINK THIS

02:29:27.024 --> 02:29:29.427
HAS BEEN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:33.230
BUT I THINK DERAILS IT I WOULD

02:29:33.297 --> 02:29:34.932
I WOULD CAUTION MY COLLEAGUES

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:38.235
THAT THIS MAY SOUND ODD AS IF

02:29:38.302 --> 02:29:40.071
IT IS PURSUING JUSTICE IN

02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:41.439
MAKING CERTAIN THE INDIVIDUALS

02:29:41.505 --> 02:29:42.740
ARE SAFE IN THE WORKPLACE. BUT

02:29:42.807 --> 02:29:43.841
THE INDICATE THE UNINTENDED

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:46.010
CONSEQUENCES COULD VERY WELL

02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:47.978
CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN

02:29:48.045 --> 02:29:50.581
CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE I WOULD I

02:29:50.648 --> 02:29:53.484
WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:54.085
CAST A NO VOTE IN ITS CURRENT

02:29:54.151 --> 02:29:58.289
FORM. IS THERE ANY FURTHER

02:29:58.356 --> 02:30:00.524

THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THERE'S

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.428
BEEN A MOVEMENT HERE THAT WE

DON'T DO THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT

02:31:26.277 --> 02:31:27.645

TO NOT HIRE AN INDIVIDUAL BASED

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:31.916
