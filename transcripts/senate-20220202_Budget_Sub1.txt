THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR RESILIENCY. AND CONTINUING TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS CAN GET AN EDUCATION AND THEY CAN BE SAFE. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE HAD TO DO THIS. AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE PANDEMIC ITSELF. OF THE LOSSES THE DESTRUCTION- THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF COLD IT MITIGATION RESOURCES. AND SEEING SPIKES AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND- THE CORONAVIRUS IT WILL BE- AT. THE DELTA PEERING INTO OUR OWN CRIMES. THESE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT THINGS OUR SCHOOLS HAVE. TRIED TO DO ALL THIS AND NAVIGATE THINGS LIKE. INDEPENDENT STUDY AND CHASE. A WAIVER AT A TIME WHEN- STUDENTS AND STAFF WERE EITHER UNABLE TO COME TO SCHOOL- THOSE CHALLENGES HAVE MANIFESTED THEMSELVES IN WAYS. THAT HAVE TO HAVE FELT LIKE IMPOSSIBLE. CIRCUMSTANCES TO OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. A BILL YET EVERYONE HAS PERSEVERED OUR SCHOOLS ARE OPEN. WE RECOGNIZE THAT STUDENTS DO BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- YOU KNOW AS OF- JULY I PROBABLY VISITED FORTY FIVE SCHOOLS MYSELF.

TESTED ARE NOW PROVIDING FACEMASKS AND OTHER TYPES OF PEOPLE. TO ALL OF OUR STAFF AT THE OF BAD. HELP OUR SCHOOL NAPA. THE J. THIRTY A WAY KIND. ANOTHER TYPES OF CONVERSATION ABOUT WHEN SCHOOL CAN BE OPEN- WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE TO CLOSE IN HOW WE SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS DURING THE PROCESS. IN SPITE OF ALL OF THIS. IS SENATOR MAN POINTED OUT WE FIND OURSELVES AGAIN- WITH ROBUST REVENUE SURPLUSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A GREAT EDUCATION BUDGET. AND WILL NEED THESE RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN HELP OUR STUDENTS HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE PANDEMIC. WE COVER ACADEMICALLY FROM LOST TIME IN FROM- LEARNING GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEN TO LOOK OUT FOR TO THE FUTURE AND HOW OUR STUDENTS THRIVE ACADEMICALLY AND PREPARE. FOR SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP EVERYONE SAFE AND THAT MAKES SAFETY AT OUR SCHOOLS. ARE NUMBER ONE JOB- AS YOU LOOK THROUGH THIS BUDGET YOU WILL SEE THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT IT MAKES FOR PRE K. THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE. ARE AGAIN ROBUST- YOU KNOW THIS YEAR HI EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION BILLION MORE THAN LAST YEAR- AND THIS WOULD BE THE HIGHEST LEVEL FUNDING FOR K. FOURTEEN SCHOOLS EVER- YOU KNOW JUST AT THE END OF YOUR HIGHLIGHTS. THE FOUR MILLION AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT VARIOUS EFFORTS AROUND- RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF TEACHERS YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MASSIVE STAFFING SHORTAGE IN OUR SCHOOLS. ALL SCHOOLS IN THE NATION AND ALL WORK FOR SECTORS IN THE NATION NOT JUST EDUCATION. ON JUST YESTERDAY I CAN BEING TO A WORK GROUP THAT IS FOCUSED ON JUST ONE THING HI WE OFFSET THOSE STAFF SHORTAGES AND IT BRINGS TOGETHER ALL THE PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY. TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE INCREASE COMPENSATION HOW DO WE HOPE MORE PART TIME STAFF BECOME FULL TIME STAFF MORE TRAINING AND WE BUILD A PATHWAY TO GET MORE TEACHERS WILL BUS DRIVERS. PRINCIPLES AND EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES THERE ARE MANY COMPONENTS IN THIS BUDGET TO HELP CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP- THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO BE RECOGNIZED THAT LEARNING HAPPENS DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. AS WELL AS BEFORE SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL AND HOW DO WE SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS ANOTHER BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS FOR COLLEGE CAREER PATHWAYS COLLEGE AND CAREER PATHWAYS. TO SUPPORT- THE PATHWAY. EDUCATION THAT HELP STUDENTS GET A TO GREAT FUTURE- A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INVEST- ONE TIME INVEST TO SUPPORT LITERACY TO MAKE SURE THIS HAVE RE COACHES SPECIALISTS AS YOU KNOW IN SEPTEMBER I NAME DATE AND IF IT'S SAFE TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN LEARN TO READ BY THIRD GRADE AND THAT WE'VE MADE COMMITMENTS TO SUPPORT NEW PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS SCHOOL READY MISS SET- ADDRESS THE KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS OUR STUDENTS NEED. RATIONAL DEVELOPER THAT EDUCATORS NEED AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIALS THE BOOKS- WE PLEDGE TO PROVIDE A MILLION BOOKS TO FAMILIES- WHO NEED THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALREADY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP WITH SOME ONLINE- BOOK AVAILABILITY WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS JUST IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS TO DOWNLOAD BOOKS FOR FREE DURING THAT TWO MONTH PERIOD. MORE THAN TWO MILLION BOOKS HAVE BEEN READ ONLINE AND ALREADY A MILLION BOOKS HAVE BEEN DOWNLOADED BY THE WAY THESE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO DOWNLOAD THESE BOOKS. UNLIMITED NUMBER OF BOOKS FOR FREE- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS- THE EFFORTS THAT WE NEED TO HELP CLOSE THE LITERACY GAP AND ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS LEARN TO READ. BY THIRD GRADE. IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULA. IN EARLY LEARNING AND CARE OF BILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE FIRST YEAR OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- INTO SET UP THE PATHWAY TO SEE THAT PROGRAM- IMPLEMENTED OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AGAIN AS I REITERATE ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY- A BILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT- TESTING- ANTIGEN TESTING ON SITE TESTING- THEN JOB OTHER TYPES OF RESOURCES. OFFER COATED MEDICATION- UNIVERSAL MEALS- THAT- A FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR UNIVERSAL MEALS PROGRAM EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO TWO MEALS REGARDLESS OF THEIR OF THEIR FINANCIAL BACKGROUND OR THE ZIP CODE OR ANY PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS- AND OF COURSE THERE'S A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. TO SUPPORT THE RISING COSTS OF EDUCATION OF FOR OUR SCHOOLS- OF THE SAMBA ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS SCHOOL FACILITY ISSUES AND SO ONCE AGAIN WE FIND OURSELVES WITH THE VERY ROBUST BUDGET- WITH GREAT RESOURCES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT QUITE FRANKLY. IS BETTER THAN WE'VE HAD BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON INEQUITIES. THAT EXIST BEFORE FOR HELLO. IN WE FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION NOW TO BILL AND EDUCATE SYSTEM. THAT CAN GO BEYOND WE'VE HAD. AND UP QUALITY OF FOR ALL SEASONS UP WORST. BUT WE GOTTA GET THROUGH THE CHALLENGES OF SAFETY THAT THE PANDEMIC I REPRESENTS FOR US IF I COULD ASK FOR- MY TEAM TO HELP IN PUTTING UP ASIDE. I LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IN THE CONTEXT OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- IN MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING. TO DO AS WE SAY TO HELP TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS- YOU'LL SEE RIGHT AT THE TOP ARE UNIVERSAL MEALS PROGRAM UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL I WANT TO CALL OUT THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAM. THREE BILLION DOLLAR STRATEGY THAT ALLOWS OUR SCHOOLS TO HAVE RESOURCES LIKE HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICES. AND OF COURSE TRANSFORMATIVE SERVICES THAT CAN HELP TO END THE SCHOOL TO PRISON. THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- BILLIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING TO SUPPORT NEW EDUCATORS I'M TO HELP US. SUPPORT OUR PROFESSION OF EDUCATORS ANTI RACISM TRAINING TO GIVE US THE RESOURCES TO WORK TO OUR SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS- RACE IN OTHER BARRIERS THAT HAVE GOT IN THE WAY. OF OUR STUDENTS THE STATE HAS ALREADY. PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN BIRTH THE TWENTY FIVE. AND OF COURSE- FUNDING FOR EXPANDED LEARNING GRANTED EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND SO THANK YOU FOR THE SIDE- WE JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF- THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE PROPOSED BUDGET TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING IN HOW THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET BUILDS ON THE BUDGET THAT YOU ALL APPROVED. JUST LAST MAY- IN THAT WE ARE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT GERMAN THANK YOU ALL WE WILL BE ALSO- SPONSORING SOME NEW LEGISLATION THAT HAS IMPACT IMPLICATIONS. FOR THE BUDGET BECAUSE WE SEE. OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE NEEDED- TO HELP ONCE HE AND THRIVE. AS WE TALK ABOUT- THE- OF THE- SCHOOLS PROGRAM IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A STAFFING SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE COUNSELORS AND CLINICIANS OF ALL THE SCHOOLS I VISIT I HEAR ALL THE TIME IS A RISING BEHAVIORS I HEAR THAT THERE'S A YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN DEPRESSION. AMONGST OUR STUDENTS AND I HEAR IT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE PERSONNEL- TO HELP MEET THAT NEED IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE NINETEEN COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE NINETEEN COUNTIES IN OUR STATE THAT EXPERIENCE. FIRE IN THE PAST YEAR- WE KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE WERE WITHOUT THE RESOURCES WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE TRAUMA. INFORMED CARE AND COUNSELING SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE SPONSORING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOCATE FUNDS TO HELP GENERATE ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS BY OFFERING SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN FOR ALL SEEM TO HELP- US BUILD DATABASE. OF THE BURST COUNSELORS WHO CAN WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS WHAT THE NONPROFIT PARTNERS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND ESPECIALLY WORKING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HEALTHCARE GADGETS LIKE OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES- SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS. WE HEAR US TALK ABOUT A BILL THAT FOCUSES ON THE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS STUDENTS THAT CALIFORNIA SERVES ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE UNACCOMPANIED IMAGINE IT BEING HOMELESS AND LIVING ON THEIR OWN SO YOU HEAR US TALK ABOUT LEGISLATION. TO HELP GOING FORWARD MORE PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT OUR HOMELESS STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO LEVERAGE MORE FEDERAL RESOURCES FROM THE MCKINNEY VENTO PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THEM YOU HEAR US TALK ABOUT A PAID INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THE SUPPORT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO ARE IN OUR- C. D. E. PROGRAMS. AND YOU'LL HEAR US TALK ABOUT PROGRAMS LIKE A BILL THAT WE HAVE THAT WOULD EXPAND OUR DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS BY CONVERTING OUR SCHOOLS INTO DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS ONE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO PREPARING THEM. FOR THEIR FUTURE WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO COMBAT DECLINING ENROLLMENT- THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE- TO HELP BUILD. CONFIDENCE FOR FAMILY STICKS CONTINUE. TO COUNTY. SCHOOLS AND SO- IT'S A ROBUST BUDGET WE LOOK TOWARDS THE FINAL BUDGET- IN MAY- IN DISCUSSING MANY OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE IMPORTANT. TO HELPING OUR STUDENTS HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE PANDEMIC HELPING THEM RECOVER. FROM LOS LEARNING IN ACADEMIC CHALLENGES AND HELPING THEM THRIVE AS WE HELP POINT THEM TOWARDS A GREAT FUTURE- THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THAT- CHAIRMAN AMERICA AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. QUESTIONS FROM YOU IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER SUPERINTENDENT DAN AND LET ME JUST SAY AS A COMMENT- FROM. OPENING HERE. THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK WAS HIGH LEVEL. AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED TO SORT OF SUMMARIZE WHAT THE CHALLENGES IN FRONT OF US AND- I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT. THAT AS WE GO DOWN IN DEEP ON EVERY ISSUE IS WHO IN OUR NEXT DATE HEARINGS. YOU WILL HAVE STAFF MEMBERS PRESENT THAT WILL WALK US THROUGH THE FAX AND WALK US THROUGH. A YOUR VIEWS IN A WAY THAT- YOU. ARE THROUGH YOUR STAFF WILL BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN ALL THOSE DEBATES AND SO. WE APPRECIATE THE HIGH LEVEL AND LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING INTO OF THE ISSUES. SO LET ME ASK- IF EITHER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT BASED ON. CENTER ROAD SHOW BALK. I DO COULD MORNING. THURMOND THE PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU THIS MORE. AND I AM I KNOW I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ACCESS TO YOU ALL THE TIME AND I KNOW MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST INTERESTED TO. HAVE QUESTIONS THEY WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF THEY HAD. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE YOU- MY QUESTION. AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO START- ON ON THIS BUT- THERE'S A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS- IN THE COMMUNITIES I WAS IN MY DISTRICT THIS FALL JUST REALLY MEETING WITH MANY MANY STAKEHOLDERS. THERE'S A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING ON. WE ARE AT THE MASK MANDATES COME FROM AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS WE GET AT OUR OFFICE. ASKING ME TO OUR TO STOP THESE MASS MANDATE AND- FOR THE RECORD I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AS A SUPERINTENDENT OF. EDUCATION FOR A STATE TO EXPLAIN IT- THE LOGISTICAL PART OF THAT MASS MANDATES AND WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THESE MASS MANDATE AND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE AND WHAT. IF ANY- WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR WHAT TO PASS YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ON THEM FORCING THEM. THANK YOU SENATOR YOU KNOW AS IT RELATES TO THE MASK MANDATES IN SCHOOL- THOSE MANDATES ARE ESTABLISH- UNDER THE DIRECTION IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND GENERALLY SPEAKING CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS FALLEN FOR SMITH THERE UNLESS THERE IS A COUNTY HEALTH WATER OF SOME KIND. THAT SUPERSEDES THAT IS SO- AND SO THAT IS TO SAY THAT THEY COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I'M SORRY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH- SAYS THAT. ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF SHOULD BE WEARING A MASK AT ALL TIMES IN EVERY. SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT- SCHOOL DISTRICTS GENERALLY DON'T HAVE ANY- ABILITY TO CHANGE THAT- BECAUSE THAT IS IN ORDER FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY AT THAT IS ENFORCEABLE- TO HELP. PREVENT THE SPREAD OF KOBE AND GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED BY THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY AS BEING ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN HELPING TO. KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN YEAH I KNOW THAT'S COMPLICATED- BUT YOU KNOW OUR STUDENTS HAVE FOUND WAYS TO MANAGE WEARING MASKS AND- AND IT IT GENERALLY HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY. AS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT HAS KEPT OUR SCHOOLS OPEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPEN MORE THAN MOST AND HAVE SHUT DOWN FEWER THAN MOST STATES AND- IT IS A WIDELY ACCEPTED IN HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF- THE MASK MANDATE AND END THE PRACTICE. OF WEARING FACE MASKS FOR. AND I HOPE THAT- MANY OF OUR PARENTS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE CAN HERE- YOUR WORDS. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS- YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT THE- VACCINE MANDATES AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT THE STAFFING THE ALREADY SHORT STAFFED. STOPPING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO YOU HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. YOU KNOW I DON'T SENATOR HAVE ANY DATA- YET- BOND HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT I DO KNOW THAT IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE. WE'VE SEEN HIGH LEVELS OF STAFF WHO HAVE- ALREADY- TAKEN- THE VACCINE AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE VACCINE- WE KNOW THAT- IT IS THE COMBINATION OF VACCINES. AND BOOSTERS AND MASKING- AND SOCIAL DISTANCE THAT HAS WILL BE HELL ARE KEPT OUR SCHOOLS TO REMAIN OPEN- I MEAN SCHOOLS IT'S A TOUGH PLACE TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AT SCHOOLS RIGHT SCHOOLS ARE NOT. BUILT FOR MAINTAINING A LOT OF THIS AND SO THE MASKING. HAS BECOME IMPORTANT AND THE MAN IN THE VACCINES ARE IMPORTANT AND SO- AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS IN A POSITION TO- ROLLOUT WHAT IS A PROPOSED VACCINE MANDATE. THAT MANY ANTICIPATE WOULD GO INTO EFFECT- PROBABLY BY JULY THIS BY THE WAY THE BACKSEAT MANDATE. IS WRITTEN AND SPELLED OUT THAT IT HAS TO ALIGN WITH CERTAIN APPROVALS THAT WOULD COME FROM- YOU KNOW THE FDA AND- OTHER EALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT AT THOSE TIMES. THAT VACCINE THAT THE COLD WITH NINETEEN VACCINE COULD BECOME LIKE THE OTHER- VACCINES THAT ARE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION. SCHEDULE AND SO- THAT IS- THAT IS WHAT IS BEEN OUTLINED- TO IT AND TO BE IMPLEMENTED ADMINISTRATIVELY OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS LEGISLATION PENDING- WERE INTRODUCED- IN THE SENATE- THAT COULD GO INTO EFFECT AND- SOONER I SHOULD THE ACTOR LEGISLATION- BE. SIGNED INTO LAW- BUT- IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WILL BE A VACCINE MANDATE LIKELY BY JULY. OF COURSE STUDENTS IN GRADES SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE- AGAIN THIS WHOLE THE VACCINE MANDATE THAT WOULD COME THROUGH- THIS PART OF HEALTH AND- IT LARGELY FOLLOWS- APPROVALS OF THE. VACCINES AND SO WE WAIT AND WE WATCH. IN THE MEANTIME WE EVERY CAN YOU GET A THAT HAVE SEEN IS THAT HOSPITALS OF HIGHER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THAT VARIOUS VARIANTS THAT WE SEE NOW IS KOBE WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT. THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED THE MOST SERIOUS CONDITIONS FROM KOBE- EXACTION HAVE BEEN THOSE WITH OUT OF VACCINE IN THAT SADLY THAT SOME OF THOSE SERIOUS CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN DEATH. AND SO- WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE WHO CAN'T GET A VACCINE IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR A BOOSTER TO DO SO AGAIN IF NOTHING ELSE THEY HELP KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN AND KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES OPEN. FOR ME IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MANDATE AT ALL THIS IS NOT ABOUT TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO. SIMPLY THIS IS ABOUT HOW WE KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN HOW DO WE KEEP OUR BUSINESSES OPEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES OPEN. AND OUR ABILITY TO BE AROUND OUR LEVELS. THANK YOU THANK YOU- RENTAL. AND ONE LAST QUESTION- WE'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT OF CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND I. SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND IF MONEY IS BEING ALLOCATED TO THAT. TO THAT- SPACE. GIVE ANY THOUGHTS IN THIS BUDGET AND WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING MORE ON THOSE- ON FUNDS THAT WILL. MITIGATE THE DEFERRED. MAINTENANCE FOR MANY MANY OF THE SCHOOLS WHO I IN I DON'T HAVE A TOTAL AMOUNT FOR OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS BUT- TO READ THE ALLOCATING MORE MONEY TO. OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO OUR TO OUR- IN SCHOOLS. THE SHARES ARE SENATOR I BELIEVE IS YES THAT WE SHOULD BE ALLOCATING MORE TO OUR SCHOOLS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE MANY OLD SCHOOLS AND YOU KNOW I AYE AYE SIR GO TO SCHOOL BOARD IN A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE HAD A WE HAD TO USE OUR OWN UP ON PROGRAMS IT- TO THE TO DO MUCH OF THAT MODERNIZATION AND IT IS TYPICALLY MORE THAN MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN DO AND MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN AREAS WHERE FOR WHATEVER REASON. CITIZENS AREN'T WILLING TO VOTE TO PAY FOR BOND MEASURES AND SO THIS BUDGET IS THOUGHTFUL AND THAT IT OFFERS YOU KNOW MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS- THAT CAN BE USED FOR A SCHOOL FACILITIES- IT BUILDS ON- WHAT IS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND FROM AB EIGHTY SIX THAT ALSO. IN OTHER BOB BUT IF YOU DID SAY GAVE FUNDING TO SCHOOLS DID YOU VERY STRATEGIC MODERNIZATION AROUND VENTILATION WE KNOW THAT IS- IMPORTANT MITIGATION STRATEGY- FOR- FOR KEEPING US ALL SAFE FROM KOBE- BUT THERE ARE MANY WHO BELIEVE THAT EVEN AFTER EVEN IF THE BILLION PLUS THAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET- IS APPROVED THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR SCHOOLS WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A- A TOP ISSUE- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE ACCESS. TO THE TOP FACILITIES TO PREPARE OUR STUDENTS FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE A MAKERS SPACE ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO STEAM AND STAMP- YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD- HAVE ACCESS TO UPGRADE TECHNOLOGY- TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE READY FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW AND SO- I BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS IN THIS BUDGET IS A VERY GOOD START- BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT- AT. THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS WILL PROBABLY GO BEYOND THAT- BUT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT START OF WHAT IS IN THIS BUDGET AND- WE HOPE TO SEE IT APPROVED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SENT ROADSHOW BY SENATOR MEANT. AT YOU SHOULD RENDON- THURMAN AND I WANT TO BILL THE POINT I THINK YOU IN THE AROUND VERY WELL BUT I DID WANT TO GIVE MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A PARENT AND AGAIN AS I MENTIONED OF A FIFTH GRADER A THIRD GRADER AND KINDERGARTNER- AND IT THEIR SCHOOL AND I KNOW THIS IS AN ANECDOTE AND I KNOW THAT THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTE IS NOT DATA AS THEY SAY BUT- IN MY KIDS SCHOOL- THE KIDS DO GENERALLY FOLLOW THE MASS MANDATE- IT'S NOT A 100% YOU SEE YOU SEE A LOT OF KIDS WITH THEIR MASKS DOWN OR- BLOW THEIR NOSE A LOT OF TIMES THEIR- RUN AROUND WITHOUT MASKS AT ALL. OF THE TEACHERS WHO TRIED AND FORCE THAT THE SCHOOL WORKERS TRY TO ENFORCE IT- AND IT'S A LOT LIKE YOU KNOW WE HAVE BANDS ON SWEARING ON HITTING ON PULLING PEOPLE'S HAIR AND WE KNOW THE KIDS DO IT- WE DON'T HAVE A 100% FORSMAN BUT- I THINK JUST CREATING THE NORM THAT IS GENERALLY ENFORCED THAT KIDS WERE MASS IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE AS A SUPERINTENDENT POINTED OUT- EVERY TIME YOU HAVE ANOTHER COVERED EXPOSURE IT CREATES THE RISK THAT THE SCHOOL MIGHT HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THAT KIDS WILL HAVE TO BE QUARANTINED AND WE KNOW THAT THE LEARNING LOSS AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH- NOT BEING IN PERSON ALL ARE PRETTY DEVASTATING I THE DATA STARTING ACCUMULATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S-IMPORTANT THEY'RE BACK IN SCHOOL AND IF MATH OR THE WAY KIDS BACK GET BACK IN SCHOOL I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT AND THIS IS SUPERINTENDENT POINTED OUT- THIS IS PROVING TO BE. ONE OF THE PERHAPS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF PREVENTING TRANSMISSION SO- I IMPLIED THAT THE WORK OF TEACHERS ACROSS THIS- STATE OF SCHOOL WORKERS- I THINK THIS IS A PRUDENT MEASURE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO EXTRAORDINARY TIMES WORK UNFORTUNATELY YOU HAVE TO MAKE THESE TYPES A TRADE OFF. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP OUR KIDS IN SCHOOL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MEANT AND LET THANK BONUS THURMAN AGAIN FOR MAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF THROUGH THIS PROCESS THIS WEEK ABOUT A REFINED ALL THESE ISSUES SO. WE APPRECIATE. THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN LAYERED AND THE SENATORS WHICH OBOE AGAIN MAN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU ON THIS BUDGET- LEVINE AND THE BEST EDUCATION WE CAN'T CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THANK YOU HI THANK YOU AGAIN. OKAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS INDEPENDENT STUDY AND I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS. ON THE WAY TO INTRODUCING THE PANEL THAT WE HAVE. IN THE LAST YEAR- THE- A PANDEMIC ONE UP AND DOWN. AND EVERY TIME WE THOUGHT WE WERE MAKING OR DEVISING ON A POLICY WITH REGARD TO SCHOOL REOPENING THE PANDEMIC CHANGED AND SO. ARE OUR WHEN WE WERE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS LAST YEAR WE REALLY HAD TO POLLS ARE ONE. OF STRONG ADVOCACY FOR MANY PARENTS AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE COMPLETELY. A REOPEN SCHOOLS WITHOUT ANY FLEXIBILITY AND WE STILL HAD A FEW. BOB PARENTS WHO HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR KIDS COMING BACK TO SCHOOL AND WE REALLY WERE NERVOUS. BOB THAT WE WOULD BE IN A POSITION OF FUNDING DECLINING ENROLLMENT IF THERE WASN'T SOME OPTION FOR PARENTS TO HAD CONCERNS DID NOT HAVE THEIR KIDS DROP OUT OF THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND THE SO IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHAT WAS NEGOTIATED AS AN OPTION. IT WAS A REGULATED INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM AND THAT WAS APPROVED AND AT THE- AND WE MADE SOME TWEAKS TO IT. IN THE FINAL WEEKS OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE FIRST FEEDBACK THAT WAS HEARD FOR ME THAT MIGHT NOT OF BEEN MY FIRST CHOICE AS THE ALTERNATIVE BUT GIVEN THE CONCERNS. THAT SOMEHOW WE WERE GIVING AN OUT TO PEOPLE OR SCHOOL BOARDS TO NOT RE OPEN INDEPENDENT STUDY WAS REALLY DECIDED AS THE ALTERNATIVE. AND SO BUT NOW WE HAVE GONE THROUGH- A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH THAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE AND WE WILL BE FACING SOME DECISION. A WHEN WE GO TO THE MAY REVISED IN JUNE ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE IT WHETHER TO TWEAK IT WHAT TO DO AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT. WE HAVE WE KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE THE PANDEMIC IS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL BE IN MAY AND- SO THIS HEARING IS DESIGNED TO JUST HAVE A DISCUSSION OF THE INDEPENDENT STUDY AND DECIDE. IF WE SHOULD START TO THINK OF CHANGES IN ANTICIPATION OF JUST BEING READY THIS IS NOT A DECISION THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE WHERE WE ARE FOR TURNS OUT PANDEMIC IT'S A LOT BETTER BETWEEN NOW AND MAY. BUT IT IS JUST A DISCUSSION TO BE READY BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE HAD THUS FAR WITH INDEPENDENT STUDY. AND SO ON OUR PANEL TODAY. WILL BE DOCTOR WHO MAMBA SUPER OF THIS BAR UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. KASANDRA ANDERSON MARK ONE AND HOPEFULLY I. DID OKAY WITH YOUR NAME THE THIRD GRADE INDEPENDENT STUDY TEACHER IN THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- COLLECT PETLAND AN INSTRUCTIONAL AID FROM THE ARCADE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ARE VERY WELL REPRESENTED GEOGRAPHICALLY TODAY IN OUR- IN OUR PANELISTS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE ERIN A READY- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MICHAEL R. FERRIS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND MERRY NICELY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND SO WE WILL BEGIN SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND WE WELCOME YOU TO THE- COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SENATOR LAYERED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- KILL THEM ON THE BALLOT HERE SUPERINTENDENT SENT OVER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE THIRTY INDEPENDENT STUDY BOTH HERE IN OCTOBER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT IN PREPARATION FOR THIS TALK THIS MORNING I ALSO REACHED OUT TO SOME OF MY SUPERINTENDENT COLLEAGUES AND I'LL BE SHARING WITH YOU SOME OF THE THOUGHT THAT THEY ALSO SHARED WITH ME- WE BELIEVE THAT STRONGLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT TO KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL WAS THE RIGHT CALL THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND- I JUST WANT TO COMMEND ALL MY SUPERINTENDENT COLLEAGUES TEACHERS AND- OTHER ADMINISTRATORS WHO'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT. JOB IN MY OPINION OF KEEPING KIDS IN SCHOOLS- OPEN AND STUDENTS LEARNING WE KNOW THAT OUR WORK AS EDUCATORS RELIES HEAVILY ON PERSONAL CONNECTIONS. AND WE VALUE THAT- DODD. IN THE VISION. SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF AB ONE THIRTY HAVE BEEN THOUGHT IN TERMS OF SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH MORE INVOLVED THE INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY EFFORTS THE- MORE EFFECTIVE THE INDEPENDENT STUDY BECOMES- OUR DISTRICT IS RELATIVELY THERE- WE ARE ALMOST HUNDRED PER WHILE WE ARE 100% WANT TO ONE DEVICE SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND IN THAT RESPECT- WE DID RELY HEAVILY ON OUR LEARNING MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS TO ORGANIZE LEARNING RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS WHICH- WOULD WHICH IS ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THE PANDEMIC OF ONE CAN CALL IT THAT. TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO REACH OUR STUDENTS AND PLATFORMS AND OTHER WAYS TO REALLY RETURN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LEARNERS THAT WE TEACH THESE DAYS- ANOTHER BENEFIT IS OF COURSE IT HELPS STUDENTS STAY CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL WITH THEIR ASSIGNMENTS WITH THEIR TEACHERS AND CLASSMATES AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND FOR FAMILIES TO DO HAVE IMMUNO COMPROMISED A MEMBERS OR STUDENTS THEMSELVES THEY ARE ABLE. TO CONTINUE TO STAY IN PUBLIC SCHOOL. THERE ARE CHALLENGES WE IDENTIFIED- COLLECTIVELY- SAY SAYS EVERY SO TO MY COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW. THAT I WAS SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN MENTIONED EARLIER- DOING THIS WAS ASKED OF US ON TOP OF AN ALREADY STRETCHED THIN WORKFORCE THAT IS GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. SOME F THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HAS BEEN- IMPOSING BURDENSOME PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS THAT. REALLY ARE NOT ABOUT IMPROVING OUR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND HAVE DISTRACTED MANY OF THE SCHOOL STEP CONST. WITH PROVIDING THESE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS TIMING. WHAT THE STUDENT IS DEEMED POSITIVE FOR COVERT FOR EXAMPLE THERE IMMEDIATELY SENT HOME. AND SOMETIMES WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND- SHORT TERM INDEPENDENT STUDY POCKET TAT CAN BE SAID WITH THEM. MANY TIMES THEY HAVE TO GET THAT PACKET LATER WHEN THE TEACHER HAS HAD TIME. TO PUT IT TOGETHER OF COURSE TEACHERS TEACH- ON A DAILY BASIS BUT THEIR LESSON PLANS CHANGE ACCORDING TO STUDENT NEED. TO HOW MUCH THEY WERE ABLE TO GET DONE THAT DAY IN PUTTING TOGETHER HESE POCKETS IT IS TIME CONSUMING AND IT DOES TAKE TIME. AGAIN USING A LEARNING MANAGEMENT PLATFORM HELPS SOME OF THAT- EFFORT BUT IT DOES TAKE TIME FOR THEM TO PUT IT TOGETHER. WHAT THE LATEST A SEARCHABLE MACRON WE HAD CLASSES WHERE MAYBE- ONE FOURTH OF THE STUDENT BODY WAS GONE HALF OF THE STUDENTS WERE GONE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. FIVE EIGHT DAYS DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY COULD RETURN- THE NEXT TO THE TIME WE HAVE TO SURE THAT PARENTS ARE IN OR SIGN WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO DO THAT AND THAT CAN BE TOUGH TO DO IN A TIMELY WITH TIMELY WAY ESPECIALLY APPARENT YOU KNOW FINDS OUT OF THAT THEIR CHILD HAS A POSITIVE CASE THEY HAVE TO REALLY ATTEND TO THAT IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD IF THERE'S MULTIPLE FAMILIES LIVING THERE THAT TAKE SOME OF THEIR ATTENTION AWAY SO COORDINATING ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IN A TIMELY WAY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND POTENTIALLY A FUTURE AUDIT REQUIREMENTS- DOES TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT AND TIME FROM WORK AGAIN ALREADY BEEN STOPPED- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THOROUGHLY LEARN THE RECORDING SIGNING IN DATING OF ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS SO WE HAVE- THAT RECOMMENDATION TO MAYBE STEAM A STREAMLINED THE SIGNATURE PROCESS MAYBE CONSIDER HAVING PASSIVE CONSENT FOR FAMILIES WITH ONLY ONE SIGNATORY FOR THE SCHOOL AND THEN- YOU KNOW I FOUND OUT JUST AND I HAD TO COME FROM THIS OF MY STAFF. STUDENT SIGNATURES ARE ALSO REQUIRED WHEN WE DO THESE INDEPENDENT STUDY- CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A- KATE THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO WE THINK THAT MAY BE CONSIDERING SOME OF THE OLDER STUDENTS- BE NICE TO SIDE BUT NOT NECESSARILY OUR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS AGAIN THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME- THIS IS A BIT ESPECIALLY HARD AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I WAS A SUPERINTENDENT IN MENTION FAMILIES WHO LIMITED LANGUAGE AN ARCTIC ABILITIES- BECAUSE THIS DOES CREATE ANOTHER BARRIER ONCE AGAIN MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. IT WE WANT TO KEEP THE VIRUS OUT IS STUDENTS IN SCHOOL WE REALLY SHOULDN'T- HAVE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM COMING EITHER TO GET TRANSLATION SERVICES IN OUR TECH SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO SIGN OFF ON SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS AND TEACHERS HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME OF COURSE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRANSLATE ALL OF THESE INDEPENDENT STUDY AGREE SENATE. AGREEMENT POCKETS OF WORK- WHICH MAKE IT ALMOST. EMPIRE FOR FAMILY WHO DON'T ON TO THE TRY TO THERE'S TO. AT HOME TO COMPLETE OF THIS OUR- WORK PACK EVERY. BRING IS THAT OF A REUNIFIED WE HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE THAT HAS SOME OF THE MOST FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STUDENTS AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR MORE. WORK WHAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO GO INTO SHORT TERM QUARANTINE RIGHT WHEN WE CAME BACK IN FROM- DISTANT WITH HER BREAK AND THE STUDENTS WERE IN THEIR LAST AND GROUP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE TO FOURTEEN DAYS- IN INDEPENDENT SHORT. TERM STUDY AGAIN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE BIG IMPACT THAT THE ONLY CRIME HAD ON WHO WAS ABLE TO BE IN SCHOOL AND WHO WAS NOT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE STUDENTS THAT FELL INTO THAT CATEGORY. SO LOTS OF REQUIRED TIMELINES TO OVERCOME IN PAPERWORK. THAT IS SOMETIMES OVERWHELMING- THIS TIME- WE FEEL ALSO MAYBE NEED TO BE RECONSIDERED- WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A THREE TO FOURTEEN DAY TIME LIMIT. I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S pCRIME WOULD COME THROUGH AND CREATE SUCH A WAVE THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR CUMULATIVE ATTENDANCE SO THE YOU A STUDENT- UNDER ONLY CRYING COULD REACH THAT FIFTEEN DAY LIMIT VERY QUICKLY- WHICH AGAIN MAKES IT- CREATES ANOTHER SET OF PAPERWORK AFTER THE FIFTEEN DAYS BURNING THROUGH THOSE FIFTEEN DAYS- ALSO GO BECOMES AN ISSUE ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE CLOSE CONTACTS THAT THEN. YOU KNOW GET INFECTED A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER- IT CAN BECOME A CYCLE OF- REALLY DEPENDENCY ON STAYING OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WE KNOW THAT- SCHOOLS CAN LOSE ADA IF- WORK SEEING THAT FIFTEEN DAY CABIN NOT REALLY KEEPING. OUR STUDENTS OUT LONGER- IF WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE BACK- IF THE STUDENT IS SICK WELL THERE IN THIS ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE PERIOD- THAT ALSO ADDS ANOTHER BURDEN BECAUSE WE EXPECTED TO FIELD TO FINISH THERE ARE- ASSIGNMENTS DURING THAT ISOLATION. OR QUARANTINE PERIOD AND SO WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION OF AS A HEALTH FIRST INITIATIVE- AGAIN GOOD INTENTIONS BUT I THINK SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS REGULATIONS MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT IMPOSSIBLE AND- THEY ARE NOT REALLY CONSIDERING THE HUMANITY. OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE ALL GOING THROUGH- THE OTHER- THE THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING IS JUST SOME OF THE- THE COMPLIANCE CHECKS GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE TRUE CONNECTION THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN STUDENTS WHICH IS RIGHT AND TEACHERS WHICH IS AT THE HEART OF THIS LEGISLATION WHICH IS REALLY THAT THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION. WE WROTE  LETTER TO OUR SENATOR IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN WE ANTICIPATED SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WE ASKED IF WE COULD MAYBE REPLACE THE REQUIREMENT FOR ANY AGREEMENTS TO BE SIGNED FOR SHORT TERMS INDEPENDENT STUDY WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO ALL FAMILIES AND TEACHERS- AS A WAY TO MITIGATE SOME OF THIS BUT BURDEN SOME PAPERWORK AND- AGAIN TO REPEAT OVER HERE STATEMENT. REALLY CLARIFYING WHICH STUDENTS ARE SIGNING OFF ON THESE AGREEMENTS- AND THAT SOME OF THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATION IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW- REALLY HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THIS IDEA THAT THIS IS AN OPTION FOR YOU- BUT REALLY IT'S A NECESSARY OPTION SO SOMETIMES IT'S MISLEADING TO TELL PARENTS- THAT WE CAN OFFER THIS OPTION TO YOU'LL IT'S OPTIONAL BUT YOU CAN'T COME TO SCHOOL SO YOU ALMOST HAVE TO SIGN IT- THINK CLOSING WE ASKED TO CONSIDER. REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE AUDIENCE TO REALLY CONDUCT SOME COMPASSIONATE AUDITS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT EVERYONE IS DOING THEIR BEST- WE HAD SO MANY STUFF OUT IN JANUARY THAT ALSO ADDED TO THIS HUGE LIFT- A BETTER DEFINITION OF MEANINGFUL CONTEXT I DON'T BECOME BUREAUCRATIC STEPS THEN AGAIN TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF LONG TERM INDEPENDENT STUDY LESS ONEROUS- AND. FOR SHORT TERM AS WELL. THE ENGAGE WITH OF TEACHING IS ALSO. FOR MOST ALL ALSO TO SERVE STUDENTS IN. SO AGAIN GREAT LEGISLATION GOOD INTENTIONS WE WANT TO KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL. BUT WE REALLY WANTED TO CONSIDER SOME OTHER REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WE- MAKE THIS REALLY ABOUT- THE PERSONAL CONNECTIONS THAT WE ARE. IN THE BUSINESS OF IN EDUCATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO TODAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND I KNOW WE MIGHT HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WHEN WE GET THROUGH ALL THE PANELS. WILL MOVE ON TO BECAUSE SANDRA ANDERSON MARKLAND- THIRD GRADE INDEPENDENT STUDY TEACHER FROM SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY YEAH I ASK TO SHARE SOME OF MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND SOME OF MY SUCCESSES AND MY CHALLENGES THAT I'VE HAD THIS YEAR. I'VE BEEN TEACHING FOR A COMBINED SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A SPECIALIST OR A CLASSROOM TEACHER. THIS YEAR I'M AN INDEPENDENT STUDY TEACHER FOR THIRD GRADERS. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY CLASSROOM MY STUDENTS MEET BY ZOOM DAILY FOR AN HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION. I ALSO HAVE A ONE HOUR OF OFFICE HOURS RIGHT CONDUCT INTERVENTION GROUPS I NEED WITH SMALL GROUPS OR PROVIDE ONE ON ONE INSTRUCTION FOR MY STUDENTS. EVERY DAY MY STUDENTS HAVE A SYNCHRONOUS ASSIGNMENTS. AND I CURRENTLY HAVE A TWENTY TWO STUDENTS IN MY INDEPENDENT STUDY CLASSROOM. THIS STUDENT HAVE. OF ATTENDING THOSE DALY ZERO. AND CONNECTING TO GOOGLE CLASSROOM TO COMPLETE DAILY ASSIGNMENTS. OUR SCHOOL YEAR BEGAN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND AT THAT TIME EACH GRADE LEVEL IN OUR K. THROUGH FIVE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM HAD ONE TEACHER STILL ALL STUDENTS WERE INITIALLY AND ROLLED INTO ONE CLASS. SO NEW STUDENTS WERE CONTINUOUSLY ADDED FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND AT ONE POINT I HAD FIFTY STUDENTS IN MY CLASS BE FOR NEW TEACHERS WERE HIRED. BY SEPTEMBER SEVENTH WE WERE ABLE TO BRING OUR NUMBERS DOWN TO A MAX OF TWENTY SEVEN STUDENTS BY HIRING ADDITIONAL. I'M TEACHERS STILL OF MY SUCCESSES WHEN INVESTING SECONDS OF THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN HAVING EDUCATIONAL STAFF FOR EXAMPLE I SECRETARY AND THE VICE PRINCIPAL FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY AND HOME SCHOOL WERE HIRED AFTER THE SCHOOL YEAR BEGAN. AND ALTHOUGH WE WEREN'T READING IN PERSON COMMUNICATION WITH OUR STAFF IS CONSTANT YOUR WEEKLY COLLABORATIONS WE HAVE THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM WHEN ADDITIONAL STAFF. WE'VE ALSO HAD THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR MATERIALS FOR STUDENTS AT AN IN PERSON SCHOOL SITE WHERE SECRETARY ALLOCATE THOSE MATERIALS TO FAMILY. OUR INDEPENDENT STUDY SECRETARY AND ADDITIONAL STAFF SUPPORT YOU HAVE ALSO BEEN MAKING SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS GIFTED. AERIALS TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUPPORTED IN THE PROGRAM. ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAM IS THAT I HAVEN'T HAD STUDENTS WHO HAVE HAD TO MISS MULTIPLE DAYS OF INSTRUCTION DUE TO QUARANTINE FOR ILLNESS. WHEN I GO TO THE CHALLENGES THAT I FACED THIS YEAR I HAVE IN MY CLASS I HAD WELL I AM TWENTY TWO STUDENTS. ABOUT 55% OF MY STUDENTS WHO ARE NAVIGATING. THROUGH INDEPENDENT STUDY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AT HOME. I DON'T HAVE A WAY OF HOLDING THOSE STUDENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEST QUALITY WORK POTENTIAL OF WORK. THROUGH THIS PLATFORM WITHOUT HAVING ACCESS OR AT HOME SO THAT'S DEFINITELY BEEN A CHALLENGE UNFORTUNATELY I SEE THOSE STUDENTS FALLING BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. I ALSO HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY TWENTY TWO OF MY STUDENTS. 36% WHO ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ISN'T CONDUCIVE FOR LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT. THIS MAY MEAN THEY'RE DISTRACTED BY BACKGROUND NOISE ADDITIONAL FAMILY MEMBERS THEY ARE SUPERVISED SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONCENTRATE OR ENGAGING LESSONS. DURING OUR SYNCHRONOUS MEETINGS MISSED SOME OF THE INSTRUCTION IN CLASS. OVERALL AFTER LOOKING AT THE- AND SUCCESSES OF THIS YEAR I DO FEEL THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR STUDENTS AS WE DISCUSSED. I DO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE A MEDICAL NEED OR SUPPORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROGRAM I AM WITH ALL THAT SAID I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING SOMEBODY THAT'S ON THE GROUND THE WAY YOU HAVE BEEN- TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN MORE HOLDING ALL QUESTIONS UNTIL WORK. A DONE WITH ALL THE SPEAKERS WILL NOW MOVE TO COLLECT HETLAND AND STRUCTURAL AID FROM THE ARCADIA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LAYERED AND SENATORS ARE CHOI BOGUE AND MAN ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND OUR QUARTER MILLION MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MY NAME IS COLETTE HEADLINES AND I AM A SPECIAL EDUCATION PARA PROFESSIONAL IT SUNNY BRAE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN ARCADIA. I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE A MOTHER SO I HAVE SOME PESONAL EXPERIENCE WITH INDEPENDENT STUDY. MY DAUGHTER. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THREE OF HER HIGH SCHOOL YEARS. I'VE WORKED WITH SECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS IN BOTH TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM SETTINGS. AS WELL AS RECENTLY THROUGH INDEPENDENT STUDY. DURING MY DAUGHTER SKIES SOPHOMORE YEAR AT ARCADIA HIGH SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A VERY AGGRESSIVE CASE OF SCOLIOSIS AND WITHIN JUST A FEW MONTHS WE WERE LIVING IN SACRAMENTO AT THE RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE WITH HER RECOVERING FROM MAJOR SPINAL SURGERY. AND SUFFERING THROUGH SOME VERY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS FROM HER NEWLY ALIGNED SPYING. CHANGING SCHOOLS WAS NOT AN OPTION BUTTON OR WAS FAILING THROUGH NON ATTENDANCE. THANKFULLY SHE HAD A COUNSELOR AT THE SCHOOL WHO SUGGESTED INDEPENDENT STUDY AND SHE HAD AN INCREDIBLE TEACHER WHO HELPED HER NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM SHE WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE WITH HONORS IN TWENTY NINETEEN RIGHT BEFORE. THIS PANDEMIC HIT US. SO WHETHER IT'S FULLY- JUST LIKE MY DAUGHTER SITUATION ORACLE THE NINETEEN INDEPENDENT STUDY OFFERS A SAFE OPTION. FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE EDUCATION. CURRENTLY I SUPPORT MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH A VARIETY OF NEEDS I WORK IN A SPECIAL DAY CLASSROOM WITH THE TEACHER. AND OTHER SUPPORT STAFF SUCH AS ONE TO ONE AIDS RIGHT NOW NONE OF MY STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN INDEPENDENT STUDY HOWEVER ON I DO. ON A DAILY BASIS WE COULD BE INFORMED OF THE NEEDS FROM SOME OF THE PARENTS AND ASKED TO SUPPORT. IT'S HARD TO TELL WHEN WE'RE GOING TO FEEL THE NEED TO TRANSITION IN SUPPORT OF STUDENTS IN INDEPENDENT STUDY. FOR DECADES INDEPENDENT STUDY HAS BEEN A VIABLE OPTION FOR FAMILIES AND STUDENTS IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS. IT'S ALLOWED FOR INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATIONAL SUPPORTS. AS WELL AS FLEXIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH THE REGULATORY AND AUDIT PROCESS. AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS INDEPENDENT STUDY REQUIRES STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY AT HOME WITH THE SUPPORT OF THEIR FAMILIES AND SCHOOL STAFF. FOR THIS SCHOOL YEAR THE STATE ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF REQUIREMENTS TO INDEPENDENT STUDY THERE BY ALTERING THE FLEXIBILITY OF PROGRAM AND MAKING IT MUCH MORE LIKE DISTANCE LEARNING. K. THREE STUDENTS ARE NOW REQUIRED TO SIGN ON FOR SYNCHRONOUS DAILY INSTRUCTION. STUDENTS IN FOURTH THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DAILY LIFE INSTRUCTION AND WEEKLY SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS MUST HAVE WEEKLY SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION. THE STAFF ARE REQUIRED TO LOG DALY PARTICIPATION DOCUMENTED FROM ONLINE ACTIVITIES. PRIOR TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS THE RULES FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY WERE CLEAR STUDENTS COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM IF THEY WEREN'T COMPLETING THE WORK FOR MAKING PROGRESS ON THEIR ASSIGNMENTS THERE WERE VERY CLEAR AND CONCISE PROCEDURES FROM WHAT WE HAD TO DO BEFORE INFORMING THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. EXCUSE ME WITH THESE RECENT CHANGES WE'VE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL CHALLENGES. ONE WE ARE OVERWHELMED WITH THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO CONNECT WITH ON A DAILY BASIS AND THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE STUDENTS THAT WERE SUPPORTING THE CLASSROOM. TWO WELL WE'RE REQUIRED TO RE ENGAGE THE FAMILIES AS WE DID DURING DISTANCE LEARNING. THE STATE HAS NOT DEFINED WHAT RECOURSE WE HAVE IF FAMILIES ARE UNABLE OR CHOOSE NOT TO ENGAGE IN THE PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARENTS MA NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THEIR STUDENTS BECAUSE OF WORK OBLIGATIONS OR EVEN A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IN THE MATERIAL OR THE CURRICULUM. THREE WHEN A STUDENT IS NOT PARTICIPATING AND OR COMPLETING THEIR COURSEWORK WE REALLY HAVE NO GUIDANCE ON THE TIME LINE TO CONTINUE KEEPING THE STUDENTS IN INDEPENDENT STUDY. VERSUS REMOVING THEM FROM THE PROGRAM. PREVIOUSLY WE WERE ALLOWED TO REMOVE THE STUDENT FROM INDEPENDENT STUDY WHEN THEY FAILED TO COMPLETE THEIR COURSEWORK. WITH THIS PROGRAM BEING A REQUIRED OPTION NOW WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. EVEN IF THEY FAIL TO ENGAGE PARTICIPATE OR COMPLETE THE COURSEWORK. FOR ATTENDANCE ISSUES FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY HAVE NOT BEEN CLEARLY DEFINED AS THEY RELATE TO TRUANCY AND THE START PROCESS AND FINALLY WE EXPEND SO MUCH TIME AND RESOURCES FOR OUR INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM. SO WHEN THE STUDENTS AND PARENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THEIR PART WILL THERE BE A LOSS OF FUNDING WILL WE BE HELD HARMLESS AND COULD WE BE LOSING THE ADA THESE ARE THE HARD CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING IN ASKING TO GO SHE ASIANS TABLE. IN CONCLUSION INDEPENDENT STUDY HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EDUCATE STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM EDUCATION BECAUSE OF UNIQUE ABILITIES AND SUCH. INSTALLATIONS RICO THE REQUIREMENTS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE A QUALITY EDUCATION WITH STRICT GUIDANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN PERSON LEARNING IS THE BEST OPTION WHEN IT CAN BE DONE SAFELY WHEN IT CAN INDEPENDENT STUDY NEEDS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE DISTRICTS REQUIREMENT TO EDUCATE THE STUDENTS AND THE STUDENTS ABILITY TO ENGAGE AND COMPLETE THEIR COURSE WORK INDEPENDENTLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT AND TIME DEVOTED TO THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION. AND THANK YOU WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ERIN A READY- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I AM ACTUALLY BE SPEAKING TODAY ON THAT ON THE ISSUE AND- INDEPENDENT STUDY- THANK YOU LEANING GRANT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU TO MUCH EARLIER THAN SENATORS- SO IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING DIFFICULTY WITH STUDENT ATTENDANCE STUDENT COVER NINETEEN- THE PANDEMIC AND- ONGOING ISSUES INDEPENDENT STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN OPTION FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. TO USE TO COUNT INSTRUCTIONAL TIME FOR STUDENT WORK THAT IS BEING DONE REMOTELY. AND TO HELP PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY AND FLEXIBILITY. AROUND HOW INSTRUCTIONAL TIME IS COMPUTED THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES CHANGES TO INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT WOULD ALLOW SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION TO COUNT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. IN TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT STUDY IN ADDITION TO STUDENT WORK PRODUCT- IT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY ON THE TIMELINE FOR ELEAZAR THE COLLECT ASSIGN INDEPENDENT STUDY PLAN FOR BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SO ANYTHING OVER FOURTEEN DAYS- INDEPENDENT STUDY. AND WHILE WE AS A AS AN ADMINISTRATION ARE COMMITTED TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ELLIE AS CAN STILL CHOOSE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL I ASKED HIM COURSE BASED I GUESS. TO MAKE QUALITY SHORT AND LONG TERM REMOTE INSTRUCTION MODELS THAT BEST SERVE. THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'RE HOLDING THE QUESTIONS TO WE GET THROUGH ALL SIX SPEAKERS. NEXT IS MICHAEL R. FERRIS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL SANDERS WITH THE L. A. O. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY- SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS TIME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WAS JUST RELEASED YESTERDAY. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO INDEPENDENT STUDY WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH SPECIFIC. RECOGNIZE RED STAR. OF A CONDITION OF MY HAVE ON NO FOR THE COMMENTS BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE CARPETS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MERRY NICELY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. A GOOD MORNING- CHAIR LAYERED AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- HEARING A FLEET CHIEF DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE PROPOSALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. AS WELL AS OTHERS. THAT HAVE PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS ISSUES REGARDING KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN OPERATING SAFELY. DURING THE PANDEMIC. INDEPENDENT STUDY IS A CRITICAL TOOL IN KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN. AND THERE ARE OTHER INTERCONNECTED ISSUES TO ADDRESS TO YOU SUCH AS THE SUPPLY OF EDUCATORS. AS WE WORK THROUGH THESE PROPOSALS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO NOT PENALIZE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WERE TRYING TO KEEP CLASSROOMS RUNNING FOR KEEPING THEIR STUDENTS HEALTHY AND SAFE. AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THIS LENS IS CAPPED. AS WE DISCUSSED HOW BEST TO HELP ELEAZAR GET THROUGH THE THIRD YEAR OF THIS PANDEMIC. I HAVE WITH ME ELIZABETH DEAR STEAM DIRECTOR OF CDC'S SCHOOL FISCAL SERVICES DIVISION. TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A. N. T. R. I'M GOING TO DO THIS IS THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO LEAD WITH A COUPLE. IN. A. L. I'M WONDERING MAYBE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SINCE SOME OF THESE ARE OF PROPOSALS ARE LATE BREAKING NEWS IF YOU JUST GO SLIGHTLY INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE CHANGES ARE FROM THE CURRENT YEAR THAT YOU ARE RECOMMENDING- LENA GRANT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO CURRENTLY A SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION- OR IT THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE NOW MAKE SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION COUNT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL TIME- INTERNATIONAL INDEPENDENT STUDY PRIOR TO THIS PROPOSAL THAT WAS NOT- AVAILABLE TO EARLY EIGHTIES SO I THINK I BELIEVE IT'S EDUCATION CODE SECTION FIVE ONE SEVEN FOUR FIVE POINT. FIVE ONE SEVEN FOUR SEVEN POINT FIVE- SUBDIVISION BE- ONE AD SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION- TO DOCUMENTARY FOR A PARTICIPATION OF A STUDENT IS DOCUMENTED AND THEN OF TO CLARIFY IS WHAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE PEOPLE WORK PRODUCT FOR THE PURPOSES OF COUNTING TOWARD APPORTIONMENT CREDIT SO PEOPLE WORK PRODUCT HAS A DEFINITION IN STATUTE AND THAT IS CLARIFIED. IN THIS PROPOSAL. AND THEN- IN ADDITION WE ARE- ALLOWING- WE PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY ON THE TIMELINE FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO COLLECT THOSE SIGNED INDEPENDENT STUDY AGREEMENTS FOR STUDENTS THAT THE BILL INTO BOTH SHORT TERM SO ANYTHING UNDER FIFTEEN DAYS AND LONG TERM DID ANYTHING OVER FOURTEEN DAYS- INDEPENDENT STUDY TO- EVERY TIME A STUDENT ENTERS INTO AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PLAN THEY- HAVE TO HAVE. A THAT PLAN SIGNED BY THEIR PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND TO THEIR INSTRUCTOR. AND EVENTUALLY OUR PROPOSAL IS TO CLICK TO MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE FOR THE SIGNATURES HE COLLECTED. AND THAT IS THOSE THREE MAJOR POINTS ARE THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING CHANGES YEAH THANK YOU THEN LET ME GO TO THE PANELISTS. AND JUST ASKING MANY OF THE PANELISTS- DESCRIBED OF WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THAT LET ME JUST PUT A FINER POINT ON IT JUST ALLOW YOU IN THE ANSWER TO ONE QUESTION SAY WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN THE INDEPENDENT STUDY FROM MARKET I HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT SOME OF YOU ARE HEARING WHAT FINANCES FOR POSING FOR THE FIRST TIME WHICH IS WHY I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY REITERATED IT MAY HEARING. AND THEN WHAT DO YOU WISH WOULD REMAIN A SO IT'S REALLY WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE FRAMEWORK THAT DOESN'T EXIST WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO REMAIN AND- LET ME JUST GO THROUGH OUR FIRST THREE PANELISTS AND SEE IF ANY OF THEM HAVE ANY COMMENTS WITH THAT QUESTION AND WE WOULD START WITH DR MALDONADO. THANK SENATOR LETTERED- I AGREE WITH SOME OF THESE. PROPOSALS AT LYNETTE HE NOW HAS MENTIONED- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIFTEEN DAYS BECAUSE- I AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM MY STUDIES ARE CUMULATIVE DAYS SO. THE CITY COULD HAVE- TAKEN FIVE IN THE FALL AND SUDDENLY TEN IN THIS IN JANUARY MAYBE ANOTHER FIVE LATER. IN THOSE ALL CREATES SOME CONFUSION FOR STUFF SO THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED- I DO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE COULD MAYBE. REMOVE THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY FEEL A LITTLE BIT ARBITRARY AND DEPENDING ON HOW THE VIRUS MOVES AND WHAT IT CAUSES. IN TERMS OF ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE PERIODS IT COULD THEY COULD POTENTIALLY END UP. CREATING AGAIN. A SITUATION WHERE THE STUDENTS TRYING TO CATCH UP TO THE WORK MAYBE ILL. AND THEN HAS TO COME BACK TO SCHOOL CONTINUE THEIR LEARNING- SO THE PHYSICIAN OF FLEXIBILITY I WOULD NEED TO UNDERSTAND FURTHER WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- TO MAKE IT MORE. REASONABLE IN TERMS. MOST ARE ABOUT THAT I KNOW- SO HERE- SO I JUST WANT SOME SOME ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION OF THAT IT IS VERY DESTRUCTIVE TO STUDENTS WHEN THEY'RE MOVING IN AND OUT OF INDEPENDENCE TO THE SHORT TERM INDEPENDENCE IN THE LONG TERM THEY CHOOSE THAT AS WELL BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE CLASSROOM AND BEING AT HOME. SO I DO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US THINK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SOME ADDITIONAL- THANKS ABILITY AND DEFINITIONS BECAUSE THEY SEEM OF THE STATE FEELINGS SEEM A LITTLE ARBITRARY AND WHEN IT COMES TO CUMULATIVE- TIME. PERIODS IT'S NOT ADDING UP THIS IS US THINGS ARE UNFOLDING THANK YOU. I THINK BVE. EARN A READY- HAS JOINED US AS WELL I THINK I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE OTHER TWO BEFORE ASKING MAY BE FOR RESPONSE. TO THAT SO BECAUSE SANDRA ANDERSON- MARC WHEN I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD ANY COMMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT YOU LIKE AND WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE CHANGES. MANY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MOUTH THANK YOU AND I WOULD ASK COLLETTE HAD LEARNED THE SAME THING. THANK YOU YOU KNOW REALLY. I BELIEVE WHAT OUR DISTRICT HAS TALKED ABOUT. THE MOST IS SIGN THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE DAILY REQUIREMENT IN TRADITIONAL. INDEPENDENT STUDY. A STUDENT WAS GIVEN A CALENDAR AND I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT THIS REALLY DEPENDS ON THE AGE OF THE STUDENT BUT IT AS STUDENT WAS GIVEN A CALENDAR OF WORK A LOG OF ASSIGNMENTS AND THEY WERE REQUIRED TO MEET ONCE A WEEK. WITH THEIR INDEPENDENT STUDY TEACHER AND THEN THEY WENT OVER THE PROGRESS. AND COMPLETION OF ASSIGNMENTS THEY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PROGRESS THAT'S THE KIND OF FLEXIBILITY I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE IMPRESSION ABOUT A LITTLE. THE DAILY PARTICIPATION IS OVERWHELMING MY DISTRICT HAS ONE SPECIAL EDUCATION R. OR INDEPENDENT STUDY TEACHERS FOR GRADES. K. THROUGH THREE BUT SHE'S ALSO TEACHING IN CLASS WE HAVE ANOTHER TEACHER. WHO'S TAKING CARE OF GRADES FOUR THROUGH EIGHT. AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND THAT DAILY INSTRUCTION PIECE IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN AND TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THAT EXHIBITION SO THAT THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEM. I KNOW THAT WE WOULD WELCOME MORE TIME FOR DAILY CONTRACTS OR FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY CONTRACTS TO BE SIGNED THE TIME LIMITS ARE REALLY RESTRICTING WE ARE SEEING MORE OF OUR STUDENTS IN LONG TERM INDEPENDENT STUDY RATHER THAN COMING AND GOING. DO TO COPE AND WE'VE OF COURSE SEEN EXTREME ABSENCES BECAUSE OF CODE AND WHATNOT. BUT TRYING TO GET TOGETHER A PACKET FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL STUDENT ON THE FLY IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. SO IT YEAH THAT THAT'S REALLY THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM TO GO BACK TO A SORT OF PREQUEL THE DAYS WOULD BE FANTASTIC FOR OUR DISTRICT. THANK YOU AND THEN LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO. COMMENT ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO IT. I CAN SPEAK UP REAL QUICK I SCIENCE CENTER LAYER AND IT. WILL BE A PART OF FINANCE WE'LL START THERE. BUT I DO NEED TO CONFUSE YOU MIGHT THROW MY FACE UP ON THE ON THE SCREEN HERE I JUST WANTED TO BE READY IN THE WINGS- SHOULD THERE BE A NEED. BUT YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT ON I WOULDN'T CONFUSE FOR ALL OTHER REASONS BUT NOT BY THAT. SO FEEL FREE TO GO AHEAD. YES IT- YEAH POINT I WOULD SAY. ON ON BEHALF OF MYSELF PERSONALLY HAVE TO BE ADMINISTRATION I MEAN WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE- THE DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU KNOW EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW- HONESTLY- TRUE HEARTFELT JUST. HATS OFF TO ALL OF YOU. KNOW REALLY INTERACTING WITH WITH THE STUDENTS OF OUR STATE ON DAILY BASIS THAT IT GOES. A LONG WAY AND WE UNDERSTAND IT IS VITAL AND CERTAINLY WILL TAKE. THOSE COMMENTS UNDER ADVISEMENT- WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOTICES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SOMEWHERE LAST COUPLE COUPLE OF YEARS WE IMAGINE THIS WILL BE. YOU KNOW JUST THE BEGINNING OF A ROBUST ROBUST CONVERSATION THE WE DO. STAND BEHIND OUR PROPOSAL AND WHAT WE ENVISION FOR THE COMING YEAR. CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE SEVERAL PIECES AS WELL THAT MAY COME INTO PLAY. AS WE- CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND WITH YOU ALL ESTATE HOMES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT WELL THEN LET ME MAKE A COMMENT AND A QUESTION THE COMMENT IS. AND I THINK IT'S FOR OUR FIRST THREE PANELISTS. OF THE PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH HERE IS THE GOVERNOR RELEASES THE BUDGET IN JANUARY. AND WE GO THROUGH THE TEN HEARINGS AND EVEN MORE THAT WE HAVE. IN THE HOPES THAT WE ARE OUT THE ISSUES AND THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT TO WILL RESPOND. IN THE MAY REVISE AND- AND AS MUCH AS I WISH TO HONOR WHAT CAME OUT TO THE JANUARY TENTH BUDGET AND I'VE BEEN A PART OF. A NUMBER. OF THEM THROUGH THE YEARS MYSELF. THE JANUARY TENTH BUDGET. IF DOES NOT BEAR RISK. TO WHAT IS A REALLY AIRING THESE ISSUES AND HAVING THE- THE TO APARTMENT STAFF LISTENED AS THEY ARE TODAY IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN DECIDE IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY WISH TO INCORPORATE ALONG THE WAY. NOW MY OTHER QUESTION AND THIS IS PROBABLY FOR THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT. WHEN I WENT HOME AFTER WE ADOPTED THE BUDGET I GOT BOMBARDED PARTICULARLY IN MY HOME TOWN OF SANTA CRUZ. BY PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN DOING INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THIRTY YEARS. AND SUDDENLY IN THE COURSE AND I THINK THAT. THE COURT HAD ONE REFERRED TO THIS OBLIQUELY IN HER COMMENTS. THEN SUDDENLY. OF THE HAD ALL THESE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY CONSIDERED ONEROUS TO DO WHAT THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DOING FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IT WAS REALLY PAINFUL FOR THEM AND- IT'S NOT. AUTOMATE UNSURE WHAT THE QUESTION IS EXCEPT IS THERE A WAY TO TAKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. IT IN WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE- THEY DIDN'T NEED THE DISCIPLINE TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE EDUCATING PEOPLE ONE MINUTE SOMEBODY THAT WORKED FOR ME AT ONE POINT CAME OUT OF THAT THIRTY YEARS OF INDEPENDENT STUDY I KNOW THAT THEY WERE EDUCATED. THIS SO HOW DO- IS THERE ANY FLEXIBILITY YOU COULD GIVE IN THOSE SITUATIONS AS WE LOOK AT GOING FORWARD WITH THIS PROGRAM. I CAN ATTEMPT TO. ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS I THINK I UNDERSTOOD IT- I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE SPRING AND JUNE LIKE YOU SAID WHEN THE BUDGET WAS SIGNED- YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT WAS A JOINT EFFORT RIGHT BETWEEN. THE FINANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE UNCERTAINLY CONSULTATION HEAVILY WITH. CITY STAFF AND- AT THE TIME RIGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO KNOW THAT DELTA WAS GONNA COME AROUND CERTAINLY NOT NOW OMICRON. AND I THINK PART OF THE CONCERN WAS YOU KNOW REALLY RAMP BETWEEN BEEFING UP THE EXISTING INDEPENDENCE WHAT STUDY STRUCTURE BECAUSE WE DID ANTICIPATE SO MANY MORE STUDENTS AND SO MANY MORE ELEAZAR. NEEDING TO USE THAN IN YEARS PAST AND SO THAT WAS THE- I THINK THE MAIN THRUST BEHIND ON SOME OF THOSE CHANGES- CERTAINLY HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE BEEN DIFFICULTIES IN PRACTICE AND- WE HOPE THAT OUR- GOALS AT THIS TIME- WELL ADDRESS AND CLARIFY SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- BUT THAT'S- YOU KNOW REALLY THE BEST THAT I CAN SAY AT THE MOMENT MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN LET ME MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS IT I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT. I JUST HOPE YOU LISTEN TO THIS CONVERSATION AND OTHER CONVERSATIONS AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE MAY REVISED TO DECIDE THAT IF YOU NEED TO TWEAK IT OR DO OTHER THINGS IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED. YOU WILL CONSIDER THAT SO THAT'S- THAT'S ALL WE CAN HOPE FOR I THINK JUST GIVEN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR MEANT DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION. ON THIS YEAR SENATE REMAINS. FIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TO. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY. INSTRUCTIVE TO HEAR- THE LOCAL. REPRESENTATIVE IN PARTICULAR. I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES START. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD- THE SCOPE OF THE SYNCHRONOUS STUDY. CHANGES THAT YOU'RE MAKING. WOULD THAT ALLOW ANY STUDENT FOR ANY REASON TO SUBSTITUTE SYNCHRONOUS STUDY FOR IN CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. EIGHT WITH THAT OR IS THAT LIMITED TAKE TO COPE AND RELATED ITEMS. RENDON SET DIRECTED TO SOMEBODY APARTMENT OF FINANCE OKAY. I THANK YOU FOR CONFIRMING EDUCATION I CAN I CAN ANSWER THAT- SO IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY I'LL JUST REPEAT IT REAL FAST SO CORRECT YOUR QUESTION WAS WITH THE ALLOWANCE OF SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION TO COUNT TOWARDS- INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. CHALLENGE FOR BOTH STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE AN INDEPENDENT STUDY DUE TO COLD EXPOSURE OR COLD AND YOU KNOW HOUSE TIVITY. OR JUST INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS IN GENERAL. YOUR QUESTION IF THAT'S THE QUESTION. YES THE ANSWER WOULD BE IT ARE THE ANTENNAS I WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT SO ANY STUDENT WHETHER THEY'RE INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR YOU KNOW JUST THAT THAT'S THE STUDENT AND THE AND THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE. OR IF IT WERE YOU KNOW BY FOR SO TO SPEAK DUE TO COMBAT- EITHER ONE THAT THE INTENT WOULD BE THAT. THE SAME STRUCTURE BE ALLOWABLE IN IN EITHER INSTANCE. THANK YOU ADDED THIS IS A FOLLOW UP- I MAYBE I MISSED THIS MATERIALS WE HAD BUT YOU SEE INTENT THAT THIS WOULD BE A TEMPORARY. MEASURE IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE COVERT ISSUES OR IS THE IDEA THAT THIS WOULD BE A LONGER. RANGING. CHANGE IN OUR POLICIES. AT THE- IS IT IS AN ONGOING IT'S A PERMANENT CHANGE OUR ENGINE AND- AND I GUESS AND AS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT LIKE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT THIS IS WE'VE GOT COVERT PROBLEMS AND THEN WE HAVE LONGER TERM ISSUES AND- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE- DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT IS RELATED. TEMPORARILY TO COVET. AND WHAT WOULD MAYBE IN FIVE YEARS IS GOING TO BE BEHIND US AND THEN WHAT. IS SORT OF MORE PERMANENT STRUCTURAL. HAVE YOU YOU KNOW IS STUDIED THE IMPACT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS. ARE HOW THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT THE DIFFERENT ELEAZAR ACROSS THE STATE. SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND SIR WHAT THIS SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY AMBITIOUS CHANGE. IF IT'S IF IT'S MEANT TO BE PERMANENT. THEY COULD HAVE A LOT OF COLLATERAL IMPACTS AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW I WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY OPINION ON IT BUT- IT STRIKES ME THAT. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE MAKE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS. I AND WE CREATE BIGGER PROBLEMS. WITH THOSE AND I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE. JERK I MEAN I THINK YOUR YOUR COMMENT AREAS- WELL WELL TAKEN UNDERSTOOD. I THINK FROM OUR- POINT OF VIEW- THIS IS WHAT WE FEEL IS THE BEST. CHANGE MOVING FORWARD BUT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY LIKE I SAID IN MY PREVIOUS COMMENT RIGHT HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY- WHICH I THINK IS KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING OUT RIGHT TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF THOSE. THOSE THINGS- AND CERTAINLY IF IT WERE TO COME IN THE FUTURE- THAT THERE WERE TO BE YOU KNOW CHANGES NEED TO SCALE BACK THIS OR SOME OTHER PIECE. I MEAN THAT IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY- STATUTE CAN BE ALTERED RIGHT- BUT AT THIS POINT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BUT THIS APPROACH. SURE I GUESS I'D FOLLOW UP AND JUST SAY YOU KNOW STATUTES CAN BE ALTERED BUT IF WE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM UP FRONT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T. MAKE THE CHANGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. PRETTY GOOD GIVEN THE SHORT TIME FRAMES WITH WHICH STUDENTS LEARN- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF DATA IS A FORMER TEACHER MYSELF THAT- IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS. LIGHT YEARS. MORE VALUABLE THAN SYNCHRONOUS STUDY. AND ALSO GONNA STUDY MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR- THIS TIME A COVERT I DO HAVE CONCERNS AROUND THIS. I ALSO CONCERNS ABOUT EQUITY ISSUES THAT MIGHT BE RAISED AS WE EXPAND INDEPENDENT STUDY. I WHAT'S THIS GOING TO DO FOR DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE I REALLY HAVE NO SENSE OF THAT I THINK. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU GUYS STUDY THIS BEFORE WE- MOVE AHEAD WITH IT WITH THE C. CHANGE THAT COULD REALLY DRASTICALLY ALTER- INSTRUCTION. I WANTED TO OPEN IT UP TO ANY OF THE LOCAL- REPRESENTATIVES THEY MIGHT HAVE OPINIONS ON THIS. I DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON WHAT THIS MIGHT DO TO YOUR- ALLEY AS AND SCHOOLS. IF WE WERE TO JUST OPEN UP A PANDORA'S BOX HERE INDEPENDENT STUDY TO EVERYBODY OF FORGETTING COVERT FOR A MOMENT BUT- IN THE LONG RUN. WELL THE STUDIO CO OF A YEAR IN IT AND IT'S NOT THERE WHEN OUR HEARING WE'RE GOING TO GO TO KNOWN. SORRY HE'S ALRIGHT HOLD WILL TAKE ON WHICH ISN'T TOTALLY. OF IF ANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO SENATOR. MEN'S QUESTION PLEASE GO AHEAD. THIS IS A DOCUMENT ABOUT OKAY IF I COULD BE. YOU'RE FREE SO IS THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD IT DO TO OUR SCHOOL DOES AND WE WERE INPUT A K. TWELVE INDEPENDENT STUDY WHICH IS WHAT I'M- HEARING DISCUSS. WELL IF WE WERE TO PERMANENTLY IS SO I'M JUST SAYING FOR KOBE THE SEEM TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. BUT BEYOND KOBE LIKE THIS IMAGINE A FUTURE IF WE CAN WORK OVER NO LONGER IS A PROBLEM- WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACTS ON. YOUR SCHOOLS. IF WE WERE TO CREATE A PERMANENT CHANGE THAT ALLOWS A SUBSTITUTION OF THINKERS STUDY FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR INTENDED STATE PURPOSES. YEAH JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'M DEFINITELY SEEING THAT WHAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK IT WAS CALLIMACHUS UNDER WHO MENTIONED THE IMPACTS. PARTICULARLY FOR THE YOUNGER STUDENTS WE KNOW THAT THAT HAS CREATED A HUGE DISPARITY IN LEARNING- THE WAYS THAT WE TEACH IN ELEMENTARY GRADES BUT I HEARD. SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN'S COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT READING AND LANGUAGE LEARNERS- I THINK IT WOULD DEFINITELY CREATE THAT COSTS US SECOND SCHOOL SYSTEM WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT WOULD CREATE A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF TEACHER SKILLS KNOWLEDGE AND ATTRIBUTES. NEW CURRICULA- DEVICES INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS INITIALLY IN SANTA BARBARA FOR EXAMPLE HAVING THEM BOTH AND NOT JUST AT THE SCHOOL BUT AT HOME FOR CHILDREN- THE HELP THAT THEY WOULD GET AT HOME IS IT WOULD CREATE ANOTHER LEVEL OF. OF AN INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM IN MY OPINION. JUST TOP OF MY HEAD THINKING. OKAY THEN- DESIGN THAT ARE HEADLINES YOU SO MUCH. ANYBODY ELSE ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON. FROM I'M GONNA MAKE ONE ADDITIONAL CLOSING COMMENT AND I MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT. AND BY THE WAY IT DID TO THE- COMMENT ABOUT A TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY- WILL HAVE HINDSIGHT FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS OF THE ADDITIONALLY AT THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISE AND I HOPE THAT I THOUGHT THAT IF THERE ARE. ADDITIONAL REFINEMENTS THAT EMERGE AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY WILL BE CONSIDERED. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR MATCH TO COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE OPEN SESSION AND- WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION WAS REFLECTING OUT TO ITS CONSTITUENCY. OF THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR FOR REFLECTING OUT CSEA AND WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE HERE TODAY WAS REFLECTING OUT C. F. T. C. T. A. N. IT WAS EXASPERATING. TO HEAR OCCASIONALLY AFTER IT WAS ALL DONE THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE SOMETHING WHEN. THERE WAS A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS TO REFLECT THEIR VIEWS BEFORE THE DECISION WAS MADE. AND SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE ANYBODY THAT'S LISTENING. ARM TO DO THAT THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE TIME. TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS IS NOW BETWEEN NOW AND MAY AND MAKE SURE. THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES THEY ARE REFLECTED CLEARLY TO US IN IN CASE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT TO DO THINGS. THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AND I KNOW LAST YEAR. THE REAL PROBLEM IN A AND IT'S ACTUALLY STILL CONTINUING. IS THE PANDEMIC IS UNPREDICTABLE AND IT CHANGES REGULARLY. AND WE REALLY FOUGHT A FAIRLY UNCONDITIONAL OPENING AND THEN HERE CAME DELTA AND THEN HERE CAME ON THE FRONT END. AND THEY WROTE CHANGE THE WAY OF THE LAND FOR WHAT TO AND THEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S STILL COMING I HOPE. THAT SENATOR MAN SAID IT IS QUESTION THAT THERE IS A TIME THAT WE MOVE PAST THIS AND WE CAN DECIDE WHAT'S IMPORTANT HOW TO OPERATE. LARGEST ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO WHYY AND WHEN THE- DECISION IS BEING MADE. AN EVEN THOUGH OUR HEARINGS GO LONGER. WE JUST HAD SOMEBODY FROM. ARCADIA AND SANTA BARBARA PARTICIPATE WITHOUT HAVING TO COME INTO THE CAPITAL AND TRAVEL ALL THE WAY HERE TO DO SO. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION THANK YOU THIS WAS A VERY HELPFUL. ISSUE ON THE HEARING WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE THREE WHICH IS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE AND I HAVE TO LISTED WITNESSES OUR PANELISTS AND RADIO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND CANNED COUPON FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL MOVE FIRST TO TWO PARENT. MORNING IN GERMAN MEMBERS IN AN AREA MARTIN FINANCE SO I'M BACK SCENTING WITH A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE CALCULATION AND SOME OF THE K. TWELVE BUDGET PACKAGES- BUDGET PACKAGE BOZELL'S. SPECIFICALLY COMPARED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ENACTED LEVELS REVENUES OVERALL HAVE INCREASED NEARLY FORTY BILLION DOLLARS ACROSS A THREE YEAR PERIOD AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WITH TEST ONE PROVISION NINETY OPERATIVES EACH YEAR THE GUARANTEE DOES. CALL FOR ABOUT 38% START USING THIRTY EIGHT CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR OF THAT INCREASE TO GO TOWARDS K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION PLUS LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES GUARANTEED TOTAL IS AT NINETY FIVE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS A TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE OVER ESTIMATE FOR THAT YEAR AT THE BUDGET ACT. NINE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WE GUARANTEE IS UP FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS ALTHOUGH THE ENACTED LEVEL IN JUNE FOR A TOTAL OF NINETY NINE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. AN INCREASE OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ABOUT EIGHT POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE ENACTED LEVEL FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AT THE BUDGET AX THAT'S A YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE EIGHT POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS GOING FROM TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AT THE BUDGET ACT. TO WHERE WE NOW ESTIMATE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO BE. FOR A TOTAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE CALCULATION OF A HUNDRED AND TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO PROPAGATE OBVIOUSLY A UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR K. FOURTEEN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TWENTY TWO ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE POINT NINETY EIGHT TOTAL FUNDING AMOUNT DOES RESULT AS WELL IN AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF. OUR K. TWELVE PER PUPIL FUNDING AT JUST OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FIFTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE DOLLARS. PER K. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT TO BE EXACT. SWITCHING GEARS TO PROPOSITION TWO AND THAT WAS NINETY RAINY DAY RESERVE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AS PART OF PROP TWO IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES ESTIMATE THAT DEPOSITS WILL NOW BE REQUIRED IN ALL THREE YEARS THE BUDGET WHEN NOW. THREE POINT ONE BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THREE POINT SIX BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OF WHICH ARE INCREASES OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION RESPECTIVELY ABOVE THE BUDGET ACT AMOUNTS THAT WERE ESTIMATED IN THAT IS BECAUSE- TO DOES HAVE A TWO YEAR TRUE UP MECHANISM. FOR THAT RESERVE WHEREBY WE ARE REQUIRED TO RE ESTIMATE A COUPLE YEARS- IN ARREARS WHAT THOSE DEPOSIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASSESSED FACTORS CHANGE. WITHIN WITHIN THE GUARANTEED WITHIN THE STATE WELL WE ESTIMATE AN ADDITIONAL POSITIVE THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS BEING REQUIRE BURKE TOLD RESERVE BALANCE OF NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION. A SIMILAR TO THE DEPOSIT SO WE ESTIMATED AT THE BUDGET ACT BUT THEY DO RESULT IN THE 3% OF THE CONTROL SHARE OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. BEING MATT WHICH THAT PARTIAL WHEN THIS MAN DOES NOT TRIGGER THE SWEDISH RESERVE BALANCE PERSONS SEES ME THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT RESERVE CAPS- REQUIRING THEM TO BEGIN TO EAT HERE TO THOSE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. DOES PRIORITIZE THE LION SHARE OF FUNDING TOWARDS EXISTING ONGOING PRIORITIES AND PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE LCF WHICH WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT MORE IN A LATER PANEL- EXPANSION OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR INJURIES PROGRAM. OF THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING. FOR THAT PROGRAM UP TO FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION. OTHER KEY INVESTMENTS TO SPEAK ABOUT FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION INCREASING ACCESS UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS THE INCREASING SPECIALIST SPECIAL EDUCATION BASED FUNDING. AND CREASING A STATE SCHOOL RATES THE MAJOR ONE TIME INVESTMENTS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. BOTH FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE WITH ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS ARE PROPOSED FOR READING SCHOOL BUS FLEETS AND ARE HELPING. CENTRIC BREASTS- MORE GENERAL JAMES CATION ISSUES AS WELL- AS WELL AS A FORTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO A PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR. AS WELL. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PROPOSE A REVENGE OF THE TEST. ONE PERCENTAGE OF PROFITS JUST NINETY EIGHT. OUR FOR THE ESTIMATE INCREASE COSTA ADDITIONAL. THAT WILL BE ENTRANCE CAN. INTO TWO TWENTY AS A RESULT THE UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION THAT IS SET TO BEGIN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT COST IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT SIX. HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS NO IT WILL BE ADJUSTED AND REVISED HIS ACTIONS BECOME AVAILABLE FROM THE FARM EDUCATION BASED ON ACTUAL ATTENDANCE DATA SIMILAR TO HOW WE RECONCILE THE LCS OF CALCULATION. AT LARGE AS ACTIONS BECOME AVAILABLE SINCE IT IS A CONTINUOUS OPERATION. WELL NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED- THIS PROPOSAL TO REVENGE THE GUARANTEE IS CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE TO IT JUST NINETY EIGHT TRIANGULATION TO ACCOUNT FOR. PROGRAMS AND FUNDING THAT MAY MOVE INTO OR OUTSIDE OF THE GUARANTEE RELATIVE. TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SEVEN LEVELS. THAT I WILL CUT OFF MY COMMENTS FOR NOW BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE. MISTER BOND WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAN FIND WITH THE ANALYST OFFICE OUR COMMENTS ARE SUMMARIZED IN A SHORT ANALYSIS BE PUBLISHED IN HARD COPY A FEW DAYS AGO ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GAVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO I WILL JUST FOCUS ON A FEW HIGHER LEVEL COMMENTS. REGARDING THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IN THE MAJOR STORY THIS YEAR REALLY IS ABOUT A STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES ARE THE STATE SOONEST HAS SEEN A SURGE IN A COUPLE OF KEY AREAS A DRAMATIC REBOUND IN RETAIL SALES RECORD HIGH CORPORATE EARNINGS. GROWTH AND EMPLOYERS PAYROLLS AND ALL OF THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE PUSHED REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE FAR ABOVE WHERE THEY WERE ESTIMATED TO BACK IN. JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. PROPOSITION NINETY GUARANTEE IS UP NEARLY. FORTY CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR HIGHER REVENUE- REGARDING THE- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE AND THOSE DEPOSITS IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF OUR- ANALYSIS. THE CAP ON HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT RESERVES WE ESTIMATE WITH THE FACT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MEDIUM AND LARGE DISTRICTS BOB THAT CAP LIMITS THOSE DISTRICTS TO. GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES OF NO MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR ADOPTED BUDGETS ARE THOSE DISTRICTS COULD I TAKE SCHOOL BOARD ACTION TO DESIGNATE THOSE WITH SERVICE FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES I SEEK AN EXEMPTION FROM THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. OR SPEND DOWN THOSE RESERVES. I PRINT A PAGE FOR WE THINK B. R. REVENUE ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THIS BUDGET ARE REASONABLE. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- EVEN INSPIRATION GENERAL FUND ESTIMATES ARE A LITTLE OVER NINE BILLION BELOW ARE NOVEMBER ESTIMATES. THAT'S STILL WELL WITHIN THE RANGE OF WHAT'S PLAUSIBLE ALTHOUGH THERE IS MAYBE A MORE LIKELY THAT THE NOT PROBABILITY REVENUE ESTIMATES FROM UP A LITTLE BIT BY NAME. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- THE ADMINISTRATION IS NEARLY TEN BILLION HELLO ARE NOVEMBER ESTIMATES BUT THE MAJORITY OF THAT DIFFERENCE IS REALLY RELATED TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC TAX PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ADJUSTING FOR THOSE. ARE UNDERLYING REVENUES- IN THAT YEAR ARE IS REALLY WE'RE REALLY CLOSE. WHAT THE B. X. THAT REVENUE ESTIMATES CHANGE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WHAT INCREASE OR DECREASE ABOUT FORTY CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF HIGHER LOWER REVENUE- THAT REFLECTS THIS FORMULA IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION ON THIS. TEST ONE OF THAT GUARANTEES SCHOOLS INFINITY COLLEGES A MINIMUM SHARE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO A SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW ABOUT STUDENT ATTENDANCE LEVELS BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND IN THE YEAR THAT WAS A AND- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT. EVEN A VERY LARGE ATTENDANCE DECLINE- IN EITHER OF THOSE YEARS ARE BOTH OF THOSEYEAR IS- WOULDN'T RESULT IN A LOWER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. I GIVEN THAT MINIMUM. REQUIRED PERCENTAGE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE THAT NEEDS TO BE SET ASIDE FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I KEPT IN THE SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS PAGE FIVE. OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN BILLION IN NEW- THE FOURTEENTH SPENDING. NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION A BATCH IS ONGOING AND MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION IS ONE TIME. AND WE TEND TO THINK OF THOSE PROPOSALS IS REALLY FALLING INTO FOUR MAJOR BUCKETS. THAT BUDGET CONTAINS FIVE POINT THREE BILLION BY RELATED TO FUNDING PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS THESE ARE PROGRAMS EXTENSIONS IN AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE SCHEDULED TO OCCUR OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD- INCLUDED IN THE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AGREEMENTS. THE BUDGET CONTAINS FOUR POINT ONE BILLION FOR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS IN ATTENDANCE CHANGES. TALK. ABOUT THOSE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE NEXT PANEL. THE BUDGET ALSO CAN TWO POINT THREE BILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE BIGGEST COMPONENT OF THAT WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET IS THE SCHOOL BUS. REPLACEMENT BROWN'S ALSO INCLUDES KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR MAINTENANCE FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S ABOUT SIX BILLION- IN OTHER PROPOSALS THAT. I DON'T REALLY FALL INTO ANY OF THOSE OTHER CATEGORIES. AGE SIX IS JUST A LIST OF THE MAJOR KICKOFF OPPOSE ALSO ONE TIME AND I'M GOING. EIGHTY SEVEN IT HAS MAJOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSALS THAT YOUR GENDER HAS MORE DETAILS ON SOME OF TOSE AND YOU'LL COVER ALL OF THEM AND SUBSEQUENT PANELS OR SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS I WANT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME. FOCUSING ON THOSE BY TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE STATE HAS REACHED A FAIRLY IMPORTANT FISCAL MILESTONE IN WHICH IT COULD. MOST LIKELY WHETHER A MILD RECESSION WITHOUT. AND THAT KIND OF BUDGET RESILIENCE REALLY REFLECTS TWO FACTORS THE FIRST IS THE BALANCE OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION NEARLY IS THAT THE BUDGET DOES NOT COMMIT ALL OF THE ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO ONGOING. PROPOSITION NINETY PROGRAMS SO THAT CREATES A CHRISTIAN BUT LET'S THE STATE ADDRESS PRODUCTIONS MINIMUM GUARANTEE MORE EASILY. AND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF RESILIENCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF THE STATE HI PATHETICALLY WORD TO EXPERIENCE A YEAR OVER YEAR GENERAL FUND REVENUE DECLINE OF TWENTY BILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. IN REVENUE WHERE TO STAY AT THAT LEVEL IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND THEN RECOVER IN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX- THE STATE OULD. FIND AT THE GUARANTEE. AND WOULD NOT NEED TO MAKE REDUCTIONS. TO PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THEY CAN USE THEIR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE ON THE ONE AND- BUDGET QUESTION TO. GET THROUGH. THAT THOSE TWO DOWN YEARS. WE THANK US OF THE ON GOING PROPOSAL ARE RECENT ESPECIALLY THE ONES TO KEEP AT. YOUR LIFE BUILDING ON EXISTING. AND MY PREVIOUS. FROM THE COMMUNITY. I'M GOING PROPOSALS NEW ISSUES- YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT FROM. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN SUBSEQUENT HEARING THIS- UNLIKE PREVIOUS YEARS THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT ACROSS TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STATED POINT SIX BILLION BOB IT'S LIMITS. AND AS YOU KNOW WHEN THE TATE. RECEIVES EXCESS REVENUES IT HAS THREE MAIN OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING THAT. CAN REDUCE STATE TAX REVENUE AS IT CAN ENGAGE IN ADDITIONAL SPENDING ON PURPOSES ARE EXEMPT FROM THE LIMIT LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE STATE EMERGENCIES WORK AND PUT THE EXCESS REVENUES FIFTY FIFTY AFTER ONE TIME PAYMENTS THIS WASN'T TOO MANY COLLEGES THE HALF FOR TAX. REBATES AND THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AFFECTS SOME OF THE CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE.OR FORTUNATE IF YOU CAN DO AND TRY TO HELP THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED FOR EXAMPLE. THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE SHIPS FUNDING AWAY FROM SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSALS THAT MEANS THE STATE'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE. BOB ARE THERE A LOT OF ITS APPROPRIATION LIMITS YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE OTHER CHOICES ALONG WITH THAT. ACCORDING TO THE FINAL PAGE. OF OUR- HANDOUTS NOW WE HAVE TWO OVER ARCHING RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY TO GUIDE SOME OF THE- COMMITTEE DISCUSSIONS. ARE THE FIRST WOULD BE TO FIND FEWER NEW INITIATIVES ARE THAN WHAT THE GROUP BUDGET PROPOSES. DISTRICTS FACE SOME CONSISTING OF A CONSTRAINT ON THEIR PASSAGE IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS IN THE COMING YEAR. THOSE INCLUDE STAFFING DISRUPTIONS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC- AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUTURE ENROLLMENTS AND THE MAN FOR THE PROGRAMS DISTRICTS ARE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF IMPLEMENTING. PLANS TO SPEND MORE THAN TWENTY BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS CAN TO IMPLEMENT A NUMBER OF. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS. THAT WERE INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WE THINK BUDGET WHATEVER MORE NEW PROGRAMS THAT NEXT. SO MUCH SO WE'RE- DISTRICTS STRUGGLED. ALL OF THOSE FINISH AND- OF. RELATED TO THAT. CONCERN RECOMMEND USING THE UP COMING HERE TODAY AND PRIVATE THE- THAT ADDRESS THE MOST CLEARLY DEFINED PROBLEMS AND THAT ENTAILS ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE. AND EXPLAIN WHAT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE IS HOW IT IS NOT FUNDING. WOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND- TAKING CARE TO ENSURE THAT. IT IS NOTHING THAT'S PROVIDED DOES NOT FRAGMENTS. OF THE STATE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE THIS BUDGET HAS A COUPLE OF WORKFORCE PROPOSALS. AND WE SUGGEST NOT CREATING NEW PROGRAMS IN THAT AREA AND YOU UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS. BOB WHAT THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND WHETHER THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. POSSIBLE WITHOUT SOCIETY HAVE BEEN TAKING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU AND I KNOW THAT. WE HAVE TO MOVE ON IN A FEW MINUTES SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND I THINK THAT IS THE PLACE THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT- THE ADA PROPOSAL AND DECLINING ENROLLMENT. I HAVE ONE QUESTION THAT'S GLOBAL JUST TO CLARIFY THINGS AND MAYBE FOR AREN'T READY YET AND IT'S- YOUR JUST GAVE US GREAT INFORMATION BUT WHAT WE TRY TO SYNTHESIZE ONE HEADLINE WHICH IS. WHAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR EACH. OF BUCKET SO AS BEST I COULD TELL IT'S THREE POINT ONE BILLION INTO THE RAINY DAY FUND. IT'S EIGHT POINT TWO BILLION IN PROP NINETY EIGHT AND BASS FUNDING. AND WHAT WAS UNCLEAR TO ME WAS HOW MUCH ONE TIME MONEY THERE WAS THERE'S ALMOST SIX POINT TWO BILLION AND RECOMMENDED PROGRAMS. WITHIN THAT BUCKET BUT I WASN'T CLEAR FACTS THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT'S AVAILABLE SO IT'S- IF IT'S- A THREE POINT ONE RAINY DAY EIGHT POINT TWO BASS WHAT'S THE ONE TIME. NUMBER TOTAL AVAILABLE FUNDING. RIGHT SO I CAN. TAKE A QUICK STAB AT THAT I KNOW IT IT'S CONFUSING PARTICULARLY WITH WITH THE- RAINY DAY FUND DEPOSITS- IN EACH YEAR BECAUSE THOSE ARE YOU KNOW WE COUNT THOSE AS NO THERE ARE NO THERE'S SOME SORT OF SETTLE UP THERE THAT CONFUSES IT BUT I'M STILL JUST FOCUSED ON NEXT YEAR FROM NOW. AND I KNOW THE BE SETTLE UP FOR EVERYTHING AT SOME POINT BUT WE HAVE DECISIONS TO MAKE AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS AVAILABLE IN EACH BUCKET. RIGHT SO OUR OUR BUDGET DOES PROPOSE. JUST NORTH OF SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN IN ONE TIME FUNDING AND THEN WE HAVE- SOME. ONGOING FUNDS IN ADDITION TO THAT THAT WE THAT WE USED TO. FINE ON FOR A- ONE FOR ONE TME PRIORITIES SO I THINK THE NUMBERS YOU CITED ARE ARE CORRECT DOES THAT MEAN I'M SORRY TO STICK TO THIS BUT DOES THAT MEAN IT'S A REALLY SIX POINT TWO ROUGHLY AVAILABLE IN ONE TIME MONEY THAT'S WHAT THE NUMBER IS OF TOTAL AVAILABLE AND ONE TIME UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT. THE TOTAL OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED. IN CHARGED IT'S A LITTLE LATER IN OUR GENDER HERE IS SIX. POINT ONE SIX NINE BILLION AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE TOTAL OF ONE TIME MONEY THAT IS AVAILABLE OR IS THAT A DIFFERENT NUMBER- SO DONT NUMBER WHAT INCLUDES SOME FUNDING SOMEBODY WONDERING THAT'S FROM THE ON GOING I'M RUNNING ALONG. WITH HIM BECAUSE WE DO WE LIKE TO HAVE THAT CUSHION. OKAY YOU YOU VERY CLEARLY CONFUSED AT. IT AND SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AS WE HEAD TOWARD MAY. I'M TRYING T LOOK AT WHAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT IS THAT'S AVAILABLE. THE A. N. IT'S EIGHT POINT TWO BILLION BASE THREE POINT ONE BILLION GOES INTO THE RAINY DAY. WHAT'S LEFT IN ONE TIME MONEY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW BECAUSE I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT IF YOU COULD GET YOUR HOUSE. PERHAPS- IT KEVIN CAN MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ME OUT HERE AS WELL RESULT ON TO PLEASE RESPOND TO ERIN'S HOPE. YEAH YOU MISTER GENERAL MY BEST DIDN'T DOES SPEND ALL OF THE MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE FOR PROGRAMS THERE ISN'T ANY AMOUNT WITHIN THE GUARANTEE THAT'S NOT SPENT FOR SOMETHING IN THEIR NEW PROPOSAL OR A REQUIRED ALLOCATION LIKE THE PROPOSITION AND YOU DESERVE DEPOSIT. SO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS A SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION- THE GOVERNOR- PROPOSES- THE SPLIT IS TEN POINT SIX BILLION FOR ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS AND SEVENTEEN SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION FR ONE TIME BY ABOUT ONE BILLION OF THE ONE TIME PROPOSALS COULD BE CONVERTED TO ONGOING AT THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO DO THAT- AS AARON SAID THERE IS- REASONS NOT TO DO THAT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD REDUCE YOUR BUDGET QUESTION BUT ESSENTIALLY I THINK THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT THERE IS SIX POINT TWO BILLION OR SO THAT HAS TO BE SPENT THAT CAN ONLY BE CENTER ON GO FOR ONE TIME AND IT'S AN ADDITIONAL BILLION IN ONGOING MONEY THAT SPENT ON ONE TIME. PURPOSES AND THEN THE REST. TEN POINT SIX BILLION IS ALL ONGOING MONEY SPENT ON ONGOING ACTIVITIES. I THINK UP DISCUSS ON OFF I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL- THE END YOU KNOW YOU OPEN THE DOOR AND ONE OTHER THING AND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON SO I DON'T WANT TO GET LOST IN THE WEEDS AND YOU OPEN THE DOOR SAY NEW FOR FUND THE NEW PROGRAMS BUT IT'S THAT THAT OPENS THE DOOR ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S THINGS WERE NOT DOING OR TAKING MONEY THAT WE'RE NOT DOING AND MOVING IT TO NEW PROGRAMS AND SO THAT'S NOT THE TOTAL AMOUNT NECESSARILY THAT'S AVAILABLE YEAR TO YEAR. IN A DIFFERENCE AND SO I'M GONNA ENDED HERE OR ELSE WE WILL SPEND FOR A WHILE BUT I THINK AS WE HEAD TOWARD. MAY WE JUST WANNA HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF YEAR TO YEAR. WHAT THE CHANGES IN YEAR TO YEAR WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE DEBATE ON ALL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. ARE BUT I THINK HAVING THE GLOBAL SENSE OF WHAT'S IN THERE IT IS COULD BE A THING THAT'S GOING TO HELP US. SO ANYWAY. IF THAT REQUIRES AN OUT OF HEARING ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. SO WHAT ME JUST ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS HERE. SENATOR MATT I HAVE A QUESTION IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. IS THAT MAKE THIS STATEMENT- THAT I WOULD ECHO. AND LOG THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS- I HAD SIMILAR CONCERNS PARTICULARLY WITH. THE FAIRLY MASSIVE EXPANSION OF EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM AND I WAS CONCERNED. THAT THIS WOULD EFFECTIVELY CREATE SOME SIGNIFICANT ONGOING LIABILITIES FOR THE STATE THAT. WE HAVE NOT REALLY FACTORED IN SO THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT STUCK OUT TO ME BUT IT DID SEEM LIKE WE'RE ADDING A LOT OF NEW OBLIGATIONS- WITHOUT JUSTIFYING WHY THESE. WERE NEEDED AS OPPOSED TO JUST INCREASES AND- YOU KNOW PROP NINETY FUNDING BUT- I THINK YOU WERE GOING TO THE STORE BUT THE CLINIC. THE NEXT. OKAY I'M I'M SORT TO SECOND PLACE YOUR- AND- SENATOR OVER YOUR ANY COM. OKAY AND I THINK YOU FOR WHAT YOU MAY JUST HAVE BEEN A ME HOPING TO TALK ABOUT THE AND TO EIGHTY EIGHT IN THIS ITEM IS COMING UP TO. THANKS FAR WE PREFER BOTH OF YOU OUR LAST ISSUE ISSUE. REDUCE OF OUR SOME TIME FOR WE HAVE TO WE THAT A QUARTER TWELVE FOR PAR COMMENT. BUT I KNOW THIS IS A- SO. MATTER THE LOCAL CONTROL.

BRIEFLY ON SLIDE AND I OUT NOT ON AB. FORTY FOR. THESE ARE FOR YOU'VE GOT. AND MISTER FUN ARE REALLY HAD TO INTERRUPT BUT- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME LIFE FOR THE DISCUSSION AND THE OTHER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS NEXT TO SELENA. GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU IN A GREAT OF FINE IT FUNNY GOOD MORNING AGAIN. AND MEMBERS- I'LL BE PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNORS. OF BUDGET MAJOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SPENDING PROPOSALS BEGINNING WITH THE L. C. FF SO. IN THE BUDGET YEAR THE LCF GREW BY TWO POINT ONE BILLION AND THAT COMPARES THE BUDGET YEAR TO THE REVISED CURRENT YEAR. OVER WHERE WE KNOW- NOW THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO LANDED ADMINISTRATION IS PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL. TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S MOSTLY A REFLECTION OF THE FIVE POINT 33% COLA. TO SIGNIFICANT AND IN SPITE OF THAT EDA DECLINE THAT WE ARE PROJECTING AND ON THAT ADAT KLEIN IS. FOR ALL CFS ONLY- AND AS MENTIONED BY MR FINE EARLIER THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS RECOGNIZED AT THE MOMENT DECLINES- HAVE BEEN IMPACTING DISTRICTS IN RECENT YEARS AND EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- WITH THE DECLINING BIRTHRATES. SO IN LIGHT OF THIS THE BUDGET PERMANENTLY AMENDS THE LCF CALCULATION TO PROVIDE. THE GREATER OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CURRENT YEAR PRIOR YEAR OR THE AVERAGE OF THREE PRIOR YEARS AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. AND THAT FORMULA CHANGE- IS INTENDED TO HELP INSULATE DISTRICTS FROM SUCH LARGE YEAR TO YEAR SWINGS. THAT MANY ARE ANTICIPATING IN. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND BEYOND IF NO ACTION IS TAKEN. WE ON COSTA. WITH THIS CHAIN IS ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT TWO BILLION. FOR A TOTAL OF THREE POINT THREE BILLION INCREASED THE LCF RELATIVE TO THE BUDGET ACT. AND THEN- IN ADDITION TO THE COST INCREASE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- WITH THE INCREASED I'LL SEE IF I FUNDING FROM TAKING EXPANSION THAT MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER HURT HER READY UP MENSCH MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ALSO PROPOSES A SEPARATE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION AND PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR T. K. AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THAT WILL HELP ELEAZAR REDUCE ADULT TO STUDENT RATIOS TWO ONE ADULT TO TWELVE PUPILS PER TEACHER A CLASSROOM AND THAT IS PURSUANT TO STATUTE. FINALLY I WANTED TO BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THERE WAS AN ERROR IN OUR BIG BASS LINE PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES USED FOR LC ABAFT. THAT TOTALS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ACROSS THREE YEARS AND COSTS THAT WERE INADVERTENTLY NOT REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. HOWEVER THIS WILL NOT. HAVE RESULT IN ANY IMPACT ELEAZAR NOR WAS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. GUARANTEE CALCULATED INCORRECTLY- AND WE WILL DEFINITELY REVISED THAT IS PART OF THE MAY REVISION. I'M IN THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WHO WILL MOVE TO MICHAEL R. FERRIS FROM THE TELESALES OFFICE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE. MY CONFIDENCE IN THE L. L. GANCE- WE RECENTLY PUBLISHED A POST AND PRINT ON OUR WEBSITE FOR YOUR REFERENCE THAT COVERS THE- K. FOURTEEN COAL AS WELL AS A PROPOSED ATTENDANCE DISMANTLE THE OFFENSE. I THINK MISS GRANT AND MR FIND GIVE A GOOD SUMMARY. SO JUST KEEP OUR COMMENTS HERE AT A HIGH LEVEL- REGARDING THE COLOR WE UPDATED OUR ESTIMATE USING RECENTLY RELEASED FEDERAL DATA. WE FOUND THAT THE COLOR IT WILL LIKELY BE 1% HIGHER AND ME AND THE FIVE POINT THREE THREE PERCENT. BUT IN THE BUDGET SPECIFICALLY. BETWEEN THE COLORING FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE WILL BE CLOSER TO SIX POINT SEVENTEEN PERCENT. REFLECTING A HIGHER INFLATION IN RECENT MONTHS- COMPARED TO WHAT IS IN THE BUDGET DOES HER COLOR WOULD TRANSLATE TO A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR MILLION. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE TO OVERALL CFF. ANDY FIFTY SIX MILLION INCREASE FOR K. TWELVE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE THE FINAL DATA USED TO CALCULATE THE COLON APRIL SO. IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. OCT PEROT GUARDING THE- ADJUSTMENTS DEFINING MOMENT GOVERNOR PROPOSAL. BETWEEN DIFFERENT. WOULD ADDRESS FOR TEMPERANCE. ABOUT DROPPED IN FRONT DUE TO THE- OF HARMON'S POLICY EXPIRING THE BUDGET YEAR. WHICH HAS BEEN EXACERBATED FROM THE CHALLENGES DISTRICTS THAT FACE FROM THE PANDEMIC. WOOD MISTER FINE- DESCRIBED AS THE FISCAL CLIFF AND HIS COMMENTS. YES THINK THIS PROPOSED IS A GOOD FOR THE LONG TERM. FOR THE SAME REASONS MISTER PRIME OUT IN HIS COMMENTS. WELL THINK THE PROPOSAL COULD PROMOTES FISCAL STABILITY FOR DISTRICTS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING IS A FAMILY PLANS. ENROLLMENT BY SOFTENING DECLINES IN FUNDING- THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM MORE TIME TO ADJUST AND RIGHT SIZE THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR THE REMAINING STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY UNDER UNDER THIS PROPOSAL DISTRICTS THAT ARE GROWING WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE INCREASES AND THEY ALSO HAVE A FUNDING FOR THE STUDENTS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THESE CHANGES WOULD ONLY BE MADE CELLS YES OF FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND NOT FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY SPECIFIC US IF OF CHANGES FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. BUT IN THE CASE OF THE MINISTRATION WILL EXPLORE OPTIONS IN THE SPRING. FOR AN ATTENDANCE. ADJUSTMENT FOR THEM- WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S TRY TO STUDY. ATTENDANCE OF. AS THIS WOULD HELP I DON'T VERY OPTIONS THE LEGISLATURE TO- HOWEVER UNLIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTERS. WITH THE PROSPECT OF IMMEDIATE FUNDING REDUCTIONS BASED ON ATTENDANCE DECLINES. AT THE EXPERIENCE IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO THE PANDEMIC. ON WHICH ARE THE SAME ISSUES THAT DISTRICTS UP BASED. ON THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDE. PROVIDING SOME TYPE OF TEMPORARY JUST MEANT TO OFFSET FUNDING DECLINES IN THE CURRENT YEAR- ONE OPTION COULD BE TO ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE FUNDING BASED ON THE GROUP AND THEN THE GOOD THING THIS FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THIS WITH A PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION. MORE TIME TO EXAMINE LONGER TERM ALTERNATIVES. ALL THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS NICELY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU MMHM THEY'RE HANDLED KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF- SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT- AS THE S. B. I SHARED IN HIS OVERVIEW WE ARE THANKFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS KEEPING EDUCATION AS A KEY PRIORITY IN THE BUDGET AND PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO CREATE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOR OUR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS ARE DISTRICTS ARE FACED WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES DURING THESE VERY DIFFICULT TIMES. WE HAVE GENERALLY HER CONCERNS AROUND GROWING PENSION COSTS A STAFFING ALSO REMAINS A HUGE CHALLENGE IN THE FIELD AND THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS UP WHILE TRYING TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED STAFF AND OF COURSE THERE ARE CONCERNS AROUND ENROLLMENT AND EIGHTY EIGHT IN LIGHT OF THE PREVALENCE OF OMICRON WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP THESE ISSUES IN MIND WHEN EVALUATING THE HISTORICAL LOOK AND OTHER LCF RELATED NEEDS. I HAVE WITH ME ELIZABETH YOUR STEAM DIRECTOR OF CDC'S SCHOOL FISCAL SERVICES TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE WE APPRECIATE ALL THESE PRESENTATIONS AND- LET ME LEAD WITH A FEW QUESTIONS OF FIRST. THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO SOMETHING THAT WAS MADE BY MS GRANT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ARE YOU MENTIONED- A SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT IT NEEDED TO B MADE FOR SOMETHING QUESTION INCLUDED NEW LISTED ALL THE THINGS THAT IT WOULDN'T AFFECT OUR WHAT WOULD IT AFFECT. I MEAN WHAT WILL BE THE NET EFFECT OF READJUSTING THAT CORRECTLY. DID YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND YES PLEASE. OKAY IT DOESN'T HAVE IT HAS LIKE I MENTIONED NO EFFECT ON ELEAZAR IT JUST IT'S WITHIN THE GUARANTEE SO THE WAY THAT WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDING WILL HAVE TO BE REASSESSED- THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO- NEW AND ONGOING PROGRAMS WILL HAVE TO BE RECALCULATED BUT IT'S RECALCULATED ANYHOW WHEN WE GET THE REVENUES AT THE MAY REVISION UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IT BECAUSE OF THIS IS THAT RECALCULATED DOWN OR IS IT RECALCULATED UP I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT EFFECTIVE THIS. SURE NO IT'S I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION SO MAYBE IT LEMME COUNTED IN TWO WAYS- AND AREA BERMAN FINANCE AGAIN- SO BURKE FOR ONE LIKE- LENA MENTION IN HER IN HER COMMENTS THE CORRECT PROPERTY TAXES WERE USED FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE MINIMUM GUARANTEES SO THE GUARANTEE WAS CALCULATED AT THE CORRECT LEVEL SO THAT WILL THAT WILL BE ADJUSTED ON THE NATURAL JUST YOU KNOW BECAUSETHAT'S HOW THE MAYOR VISION WORKS WE GET UPDATED FACTORS BUT THAT'S UNRELATED TO THIS. SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION THE L. C. A FAST COSTS WERE CALCULATED ASSUMING SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION MORE AN OFFSETTING PROPERTY TAXES ACROSS THE THREE YEARS SO IF ONE WERE TO ASSUME ALL OTHER THINGS HELD CONSTANT WE NOW IN THE MAYOR VISION WHICH WE KNOW WILL NOT BE THE CASE BUT WERE THAT TO BE SO THEN TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIN WE WOULD HAVE TO- REDUCE SPENDING IN OTHER AREAS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF LCF ASKED. TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT COST THAT WAS NOT APPROPRIATELY- ANTICIPATED IN THOSE THREE YEARS AND SO IF ALL THINGS DID REMAIN CONSTANT AND I KNOW THEY WON'T BUT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF ALL THINGS DID REMAIN CONSTANT THERE'D HAVE TO BE A SCALE BACK OVER THREE YEARS OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SINCE OF WHAT THE PROGRAMMING WAS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT CUMULATIVELY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ONLY. THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE ONGOING POT IN TWENTY TWELVE THIRTY JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT JUST BY. WITH THE THING THAT WOULD AFFECT SO I WAS TRYING AND WHAT IT WATER. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL NOW TO THE- DISCUSSION OF THE POWER. OF THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE SAID AND THE PROPOSAL HERE- AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE FINANCE WITH WITH- WITH THE L. A. COMMENTING MISTER FINE MENTIONED THAT THERE'S ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED DISTRICTS THAT ARE GROWING AND IF IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE GROWING AT A LEVEL. THAT THEY'RE ABOVE BAR THE ROLLING THREE YEAR AVERAGE UNDER PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAT THEY ALL WOULD CHOOSE TO HIRE YEAR IT WILL FINANCE IS THAT CORRECT. I WOULD IT IT'S NOT SO MUCH A MATTER OF CHOICE AS- AND THE PART OF IT TO CONFIRM BUT WHEN FUNDED EDA IS CALCULATED AND DETERMINED IT'S JUST WHICHEVER ONE IS GREATER PURSUANT TO STATUTE THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE SO IT'S JUST TERM AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY ACTION OF THE DISTRICT THAT'S CORRECT AND THUS FAR WHEN WE HAD THE TWO YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE LAST YEAR. IT DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE GREATER OF THE TWO DID. NO CURRENT LAW DOES SO IT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN THE GREATER OF THE CURRENT OR PRIOR YEAR REPORTED ADA. OKAY THEN I HAVE A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S VERY CONFUSED AND I WILL HAVE TO ON CONFUSED- AND IT. IT'S THIS ANOMALOUS SITUATION WHERE. THE FIRE THAT RAGED THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS BURNED DOWN 27% OF THE HOMES IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT BANNER HAD A CORRESPONDING LOSS. IN ADA AND IT MANAGED TO SHOW UP IN AN ADJOINING DISTRICT IT DIDN'T BURN AND THEY WERE SMALL IT WAS- A DISPROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE NOT GETTING REIMBURSED FOR THEIR HIGHER ADA AND SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THEY COULD HAVE CLAIMED THE HIGHER ADA IN THE SECOND YEAR. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OF ALLOCATION. OR YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING ME THAT SOMEBODY WOULD PICK THAT FOR THEM UP VOTE RIGHT AND THEM HAVING. IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT MAY BE A BIT OF A UNIQUE CASE- IF YOU'RE FREE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH THEM TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A SITUATION I THINK. WE MAY HAVE MET WITH SOME FOLKS ABOUT ALREADY IN THE HOME ARE YOU HAVE WITH THE DISTRICT THAT BURNS I DON'T KNOW THE CHIU OF MET WITH THE DISTRICT THAT THAT HAD THE HIGHER. AMOUNT OF ENROLLMENT AND I KNOW BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH PARADISE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN PLACES THAT HAVE SUCH A MONUMENTAL IMPACT SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER TIME SO THAT THEY DON'T JUST SORT THAT LOSS BUT ON I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS. AN IMAGINE JUST HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE TO THAT FIRED THE SCHOOL. ATTENDANCE PROBABLY WENT UP DRAMATICALLY IN CHICO WHAT WENT DOWN DRAMATICALLY IN PARADISE I HAVE NO IDEA IF THERE WAS AN ADJUSTMENT MADE TO CHICO FOR THE HIGHER. EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE THIS IS THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE. AND SO. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE THE DISTRICT HAD TO GAIN AN ORAL MUCH ENGAGED WITH YOU IF THEY HAVEN'T ARE BUT THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING IF. THE IF IN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEAR ROLLING UNDER. THE EXISTING TWO YEAR ROLLING ONE. IF HIRE YEAR COULD BE. THAT'S ALL I WAS OF GET AT AND IT'S LIKE THE WAS YES WHICH I DO KNOW. WHAT I THOUGHT THE ON NOT QUESTION. THIS THE- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE APPLAUDING THIS IS A THEY FEEL LIKE IT IT GIVES THEM A HOLD HARMLESS IN SOME WAYS. BUT DOESN'T IT JUST CREATE A CLIFF THAT WERE MOVING THE CLIFF ONE YEAR OUT AND IF THERE'S NO CHANGES AT ALL A YEAR FROM JUNE THIRTIETH THERE'S GOING TO BE A DRAMATIC IMPACT TO A LOT OF DISTRICTS. I DON'T KNOW I WOULDN'T. THINK SO- I THINK AS AS- MISTER FINE DETAIL IN HIS PRESENTATION REALLY WHAT IT DOES. IS IT KIND OF AVOIDS THE SITUATION OF THERE BEING A CLIFF ALTOGETHER I WOULD ARGUE BECAUSE- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DISTRICT IS DECLINING AND NEEDING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT VARIABLE THAT INCLUDES THE THREE YEAR. THE THREE PRIOR YEAR AVERAGE- THAT IS IN AFFECTS MOVING OUT WHAT OTHERWISE MAY HAVE BEEN A FISCAL CLIFF SO AWESOME ALL UP. TO ME REFINE THE QUESTION BECAUSE MAYBE ON NOT BEING CLEAR. I GUESS WHAT IT DOES FOR THE THREE YEARS AND IT DOES REFINE OR OR REMOVE THE FISCAL CLIFF. IF WE WENT BACK TO A. D. A. WITH NO ADJUSTMENT OR NO ROLLING AVERAGE ON JUNE THIRTIETH A YEAR FROM NOW PROVIDING WE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I AM ASSUMING THAT THERE WOULD BE. A WHOLE SERIES OF DISTRICTS THAT WOULD GO DOWN IMMEDIATELY IN THEIR ADA AT THE END OF THOSE THREE YEARS. AND ONE ARM ASKING. THAT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF THE PRESUMPTION IS. OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF CONFIDENCE AND THAT SOMEHOW MAGICALLY EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO TWO CANADIENNE IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT IT'S TO ME. THE COULD BE WRONG BUT WON'T HAPPEN THERE WILL BE LOWERED REMEDY A LOT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AFTER THE END OF A THREE YEAR ROLLING THING. THAT'S WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS CLIFF. EIGHT AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF GETTING SAVED NEXT YEAR AND NOT LOOKING AT WHAT THE LONGER TERM IMPACT MIGHT BE IF THE THREE YEAR ROLLING FANS AFTER THREE YEARS THAT'S WHAT I'M DRIVING AT SOUNDS I THINK LIKE MAYBE YOUR YOUR ALSO COMMENTING JUST ON THE LONGER TERM TREND WE ANTICIPATE OF ENROLLMENT EVEN. EVEN WITH OUR CURRENT ONE NOW HAVE YOU SEE I DO I THINK THERE IS A LONGER TERM TREND BUT COVETOUS XCELERATED IN IN THE SHORT TERM. AND WE ARE MAKING A DECISION NOW TO DO THE ROLLING THING IF WE AGREE BY THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISE WERE AGREEING TO DO THE THIRD YEAR ROLLING. MOST OF THE SCHOOLS ARE SIX REALLY WANT THAT BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THEM AND THEN THEY'LL COME BACK THE NEXT YEAR AND SAY HELP US BECAUSE OF AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM WILL BE DROPPING IF THE ROLLING AVERAGE HAPPENS. I'M JUST ASKING IF WE SHOULD HAVE A VERSION OF THAT CONVERSATION NOW THAT THAT THAT IS THE ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING THE DECISION FOR THE THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS. SO A. N. A DON'T GET ME WRONG I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION- BUT I THINK A DENTAL FONG THE PROBLEM WOULD LEAD TO A DISCUSSION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A SOLUTION IF WE THINK THERE'S SOMEWHERE THERE AND IT IS REALLY WORTHY. OF HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE LONG TERM ISSUE AT SOME POINT IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS SO IN. AN ARM I DO SEE PEOPLE COMING ON FROM THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE AND HEAD AND ERIN WE'VE HAD YOU ON THE SPOT IT DOES THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY COMMENT TODAY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. ABOUT THE SITUATION IS- EDGAR. BOTH OF THE THREE ARE THE CORRECT I'LL JUST THINKING THAT UNITED IS DEFINITELY A PURPLE THAT IS- ALL THE CHANGES IF NOT INTENDED TO FOR THIRTY THREE MCCARTY. THERE IS A CLIP THERE'S A STATE DECLINE OVER THE PAST IS THE RESULT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN ATTENDANCE IF CAL SCHOOLS. WE THINK THAT FOR LOW WE THINK OF STRENGTH OF A PROPOSAL IS THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE ALIGNED WITH OUR PROGRAMS AND THE NUMBERS TO THAT ARE IN SCHOOL. THE LONG TERM COME A OF THEIR OF THEIR NUMBER WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT ONE THING IS ASK TENANTS MICHAEL CAN. OF PRESCHOOLERS BECAUSE THE MINIMUM IS GROWING OUR IT'S GOING BASED ON J. FUND REVENUES FORTY ZERO FUND REVENUES YOU THINK KEY SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MINIMUM CARE GROW MEANS THE THERE IS A DISK. FUNDING TO YOU COULD PROVIDE INCREASE OFFICE FOR A FAMILY OF BE FACED WITH FIRST OVERSTAFFED WITH THE FIRST STONE THE FIFTH TRYING TO ATTRACT ISSUES IT DOESN'T ADDRESS COMPLETE FOR SOME. ARE HIRING SIGNIFICANT DECLINE- BUT WE DO THINK KNOW OVER THE LONG RUN TO TODAY BUT IT DOES MAKE SOME THIRTY ALIGNED WITH THE IN TO WHEN. THERE'S A NEW DROPS. TWENTY DIFFERENT TACK AFTER THEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT'S PART OF WHY WE ARE LIKE PRISON PROPOSAL THAT IT IT SOUNDS. KIND OF SOFTEN THE IBM BUT IT DOESN'T THAT OVER LONG RUN DISTRICTS TO OPT IT MAKE ONLINE LET ME TO ARMS THE OTHER TWO FROM THANK YOU AND- IF MR FOR HIS BODY LANGUAGE. IN LIEU OF TEST SO A CO HE'S BEEN OR IS HEAD AT. KIND OF THUMBS UP FOR DOWN OF ROMAN OF VERSION OF. RESPONDING TO PEOPLE COMMENTS FROM THEN LET ME ASK IT AND ON UPON BECAUSE I KNOW WE THE WHIMS AMOUNT OF- TIME FOR THIS I'M TRY TO GET THESE AND THE ALEJO. THE SIMPLE FACT THAT JUST LET YOU KNOW WHAT THE GUARANTEE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF I. NUMBERS WOULD BE IF YOU ADDED IF YOU USE THE MOMENT BETTER. I THINK- AND IN GENERAL DIRECTED ATTENDANCE AND TO BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN. THE GENERAL MATHS SO YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. COSTS WOULD BE HIGHER THAN MEANS AND IF YOU IF WANT HIGHER AND IT WAS BECAUSE THE- ADA'S REFERRED TO AS PART OF THE GUARANTEE IN OUR- IN OUR- AGENDA. IF. IT WEREN'T HIGHER. IT WILL BE ASSESSED BASED ON THE NEWS. WITHIN THE- OF THAT'S AVAILABLE WITH THE GARY A SECOND DOESN'T CHANGE THE GIVE. MATURITY WITH THE PEOPLE THE TIME THAT WOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF WITHIN THAT THE OF MONEY TO FIGHT TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON HEALTH. PROXY YOU SPEAK. TO A YOUR HIGHER WON'T. THE THING THAT I AND THAT PP I SEED A BOY AND I MEANT THE THAT THE BIGGEST COLDEST HONEST COULD A BILL DOLLAR. AND THAT ALL DISTRICTS PROBABLY SOME THAT ARE MORE. THAT HAVE R. O. WOULD NOT GAIN AS MUCH MOVING TO ENROLLMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGH AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE PER. PUPILS IN THE DISTRICT NOW. THERE WOULD BE A REGION GERING WITH IN. THE OUR MINIMUM BETWEEN THOSE DISTRICTS AND THE WINNERS MIGHT BE THOSE TO GAIN A LOT MORE IN ENROLLMENT. BECAUSE IT IS A FREE. BUT WHEN YOU'RE SAYING WITHIN THE GUARANTEED DOES THAT IMPLY THAT IT'S A FIXED PIE AND YOU'RE REALLOCATING THE SIX PI. OUR THROUGH A NEW SYSTEM. THAT'S CORRECT RIGHT SO IT'S A BEEN WE HAVE FUNDING IS THAT THE BY. THE OVER THE LAST. DECADE THAT THE THAT I'VE BEEN AND THE OFFICE WE ALL FUN THE STATE OF PROJECT WAS FUNDED AT. YOU THOUGHT IF THERE NOT GOING CHANGE MEANS THAT. MAKING IT HARDER TO SPEND BUT IMPROPER. SO THERE IS A THE AROMA WOULD A THOUGHT DEGREES. IN WOULD PROBABLY COSTS AND WHO WHO BENEFIT WILL DEPEND ON WHICH CAPTAIN RATES FOR. ATTENDANCE FOR A NORMAL. I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I THINK WE HAVE LOT. WE DON'T RECKON OUR B. THIRTY THAT THE MUCH THE WANTED MOVE IN THIS YOU THINK ABOUT OUR. AND WITH OUR- SOME PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE WAY WE FIND FUNDED ATTENDANCE AMENDED IT DOES CRITICALLY. THE BIRTH DATE CURRENT OF DOES CRITICAL SCHOOLS LIKE. FOR SCHOOLS STUDENTS THAT STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING CLASS ON A REGULAR BASIS OF ALREADY PASSED AN IMPORTANT- THE TICKET THE IN. BIG I DID MEAN TO TAKE US TO BUT DOES GOING TO BE A VIRGIN DISCUSS AMONG. AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE TO BE READY TO SPEAK TO IT AND IT WILL BE A NIGHTMARE FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE BASIC AID DISTRICTS THAN I'VE STRONGLY DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS IN MY- SENATE DISTRICT AND SOMEONE WHEN SOMEONE LOSE IF IT'S A FIXED PRICE AND THAT'LL BE A- A DIFFICULT DISCUSSION. AT BRAVO LET ME ASK OF MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS. CAR SENATOR MINUTES GOOD SENATE ROADSHOW. BOOK AMAZING SHE GOOD AS WELL. THE SO ARE LET ME JUST. ARE NOT BY MISTAKE THE FACT THAT THIS WAS PREFERRED SOME OF THE DISCUSS. FROM FACT THIS IS OF GREATER. THAN DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE- DISCO AND I THINK THAT WE WILL WANT- TO. JUST WE MOVE TOWARD. THE DAY M. P. OF ROLLING- THE THREE ROLLING YOU DON'T WANT WHAT IT MEANS COMING OUT OF IT IN I SUS. THAT FOR ALMOST CALLED WITH WE ARE AND TO GET YOUR FEET BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE REALLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THIS IS DONE IN A WAY THAT'S THAT EQUITABLE DOESN'T CREATE. DRAMA AT THE END OF IT AND WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT OR WE START TO PRESS FOR FLORIDA'S SO. I CAN JUST SAY OK CENTER BERMAN I WOULD ECHO THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS AND I WOULD ONLY JUST ADD THAT- MY LACK OF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ON THIS POINT IS NOT A SIGN OF DISINTEREST BUT RATHER- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND BASED ON- THE VERY THOROUGH EXAMINATION A LOT OF THE ISSUES I CARE ABOUT WITH- MADE BY CHAIR LAYERED SO- I ALSO WOULD. LIKE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IN AND ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER IS TO WHAT DEGREE ARE WE SEEING A TEMPORARY CODE RELATED DROP OFF IN ENROLLMENT VERSUS THE LONGER STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT WE SAW BEFORE CODED- AND WHAT ARE THE RIGHT ANSWERS HERE. BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY. IN EVERYBODY- HERE FOR PUT TO PAY ON SENATE.
