I CHALLENGES- OVER THE YEARS APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF THE BILL AND- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS THIS WORKING WELL ISSUE FOR A WHILE WE HELD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING AND- GOT INTO SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- I SHE- SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU EXPRESSED ABOUT- THOSE WHO REALLY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT- IDOLING AND ABANDONING THEMSELVES. I WILL SAY AT THIS MOMENT I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN OUR FRIENDS IN THE INDUSTRY- ARE THE LEAD WITNESSES I WOULD. THAT AT SOME POINT APPRECIATE. THE WRIST RESPONSE TO HOW THEY THINK WE'LL GET THIS DONE NOW THAT WE'VE CUT THE BUDGET OF CAL JAM OUT PER THEIR REQUEST- SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE ONGOING BUDGET ISSUES THAT- WE JUST SAW. MATERIALIZE THIS WEEK I HOPE WE CAN FIND THE ABILITY WITHIN INDUSTRY TO GET THIS WORK DONE BUT IT A TIME WHEN. THE GLOBAL VOLATILITY IN THE OIL MARKET IS REALLY WHIP SAWING OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES. WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY ITSELF IS IN FLUX- AND- GIVEN THAT THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THE CLEAN UP PROCESS IS REALLY CONTINGENT ON THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR BALANCE SHEET STRONG AND STATE.

THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE PROPOSED THREE SEPARATE CLIMATE RESILIENCE BONDS IN PREPARATION A CURRENT LONG TERM CLIMATE IMPACTS THE MAIN PART THESE ARE WATER WILDFIRE SEA LEVEL RISE EXTREME HEAT AT COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE EACH PROPOSAL BERRIES AND COMMITMENTS TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN CLIENT RESILIENCE THE STATE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN THE COULD NOT MAKE AND CLIMATE GOALS AND PRIORITIZE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THIS. IT COVERT NINETEEN HAS EXACERBATES EXACERBATED ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS ESPECIALLY IN WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THESE ARE THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT HAS PROJECTED THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIRECT CLIMATE IMPACTS BY TWENTY FIFTEEN OR IN THE ORDER OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE THE STATE MUST INVEST IN HIGH QUALITY GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE GREEN ECONOMY. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE STATE CONSERVANCY AND THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD TO ESTABLISH GRANT PROGRAMS THAT SET WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROGRAMS THEY WILL SEEK INPUT FROM THE STATE AND LOCAL LOCAL WORKFORCE PARTNERS. TO DEVELOP CAREER PATHWAYS STRATEGIES IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES FIELD THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD COVERS AREAS NOT SERVED BY A CONSERVANCY. AND SB TWELVE NINETY SIX WOULD PROVIDE THE HANDS ON EXPERIENCE CERTIFICATION AND PLACEMENT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT AGAIN WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS OTHERS THE STATE CAN USE EXISTING FUNDS LIKE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND AND FUTURE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS TO INVEST IN THESE PROGRAMS. FUNDAMENTAL TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND CLAMOR RESISTANCE IS THE EXPLICIT INCLUSION A WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES AND UNITIES OF COLORS. BUT WITH THESE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS THESE MEN AND WOMEN CAN RECEIVE THE TRAINING EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATION PUT THEM ON AN EQUAL FOOTING SO THEY CAN PURSUE THESE NATURAL RESOURCES CAREERS.

THIS THIS MEASURE. IS THIS MEASURE FITS VERY WELL VERY COMPREHENSIVELY IN TERMS OF- ADDRESSING MANY ISSUES THAT THE STATE IS DEALING WITH I RECENTLY READ AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES. THAT MENTIONED THERE WERE SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED AN AMERICAN MADE REFERENCE TO THE CONSERVATION CORPS BEING ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THAT WAS UTILIZED DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION TO GET SO MANY PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND OTHER CARP CONSERVATION CORPS OF CORPS PARTICULAR WAS USED TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE. BACK TO WORK AND- I'M JUST VERY GLAD TO SEE A BILL LIKE THIS IS INTENDED. TO NOT ONLY ADDRESS SOME OF OUR STATES NEEDS. BUT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND TO PUT A AND TO REFERENCE. THE CONSERVATION CORPS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL CORES. IN A AND I SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE BILL TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE LOCAL COURTS ARE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THEY WILL BE PART OF THE- OF THE FRAMEWORK OF DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. US FOR THE CONTRACTS AND FUNDING ON THE ATTENTION PROVIDED. RIGHT NOW THROUGH THIS CRISIS MANY OF THEM ARE ARE ARE STRUGGLING AS MANY NONPROFITS ARE. BUT THESE IN PARTICULAR SUITS SEWER OF A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION IS CURRENTLY. UNEMPLOYED AND IN NEED OF AN EDUCATION WHICH IS OF THE THINGS THAT THEY BALK TODAY. THEY PROVIDE THE MOST HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS. A GOOD PAYING JOB. AM I AM SKILLS THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN AND GOOD PAYING JOBS. SO WANTED TO MENTION THAT- SUPPORT TO BUILD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL TO APPROPRIATE TIME VERY GOOD MISTER CHAIR AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING REALLY CRITICAL. THANK CENTER WAY SO IF YOUR COMMENTS- ON ANY OTHER MEMBERS YES CENTER COPIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I AM. I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL I HAD SOME CONCERNS AND MY BIGGEST CONCERN WAS WE WERE AT THE TEN CONSERVANCY'S ON THAT WERE LISTED IN HERE WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND IN MY DISTRICT IS- AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT STATE PARKS INVESTMENTS- VERY FEW OF THEM ARE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND- AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BOB WAR IN RURAL AREAS- THE CAN TO BE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED ALONG THE COAST REGION FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BUT BUT THEN WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT FUNDING THOSE THEN THE MONEY GOES TO WAIT FROM. ARE REALLY NEED THEM AND SO- I APOLOGIZE I STEPPED OUT TO TAKE A CALL THAT I'D BEEN MISSING FOR DAYS AND I'M AYE HE HAD HEARD FROM STOP IT WE'RE TAKING THE COMMITTEE THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND SO I THINK THAT MAY TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE IS A PROVISION IN ONE OF THE SUBSECTIONS THAT. THAT THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD COORDINATE WITHIN SIX SUPPORT OF REGIONS OF THE STATE BUT COVERED BY STATE CONSERVANCY I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET- CONSERVANCY IN DISTRICT IN ONE IT STAYS AT HIS LITTLE HAPPENED BUT IN THE MEANTIME I'M SURE THAT BIRDS DO YOU. AND I LADY FOR THOSE TEN. LIST ARE. AND JUST KNOW THAT ICE YOUTH TRAINING I THINK THE REAL AND- WELL I KNOW THAT THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD WILL COVER. ANY AREA THAT'S NOT COVERED BY OF A CONSERVANCY UP BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THE SENATOR- THAT- COMMUNITIES GET LEFT OUT ON MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS AND- AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE EXPLICITLY ASKED TO MAKE SURE THAT RULERS WOULD BECAUSE SO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD WILL COVER. YOUR AREA WELL THAT'S GREAT I- I DID APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM- RANGER GOMEZ. IT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT A YOUNG INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TRAINING NEAR THEIR HOME THEN IT AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO TRAVEL SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT THE MONEY. FOR HOUSING AND ALL OF THE COSTS INVOLVED IN MOVING BUT- I DO SUPPORT THE BILL AND- APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THAT THAT THAT TAKES CARE THE CONSIDER THE CONCERNS I HADN'T TURNED TO RURAL RURAL COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ANY OTHER MEMBERS. QUESTIONS COMES UP BRIEFLY PYLON- WITHIN MINUTES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISION AND FOR. ELEVATING A CONSTITUENCY THAT IS LEFT BEHIND TOO OFTEN BUT IS ACTUALLY THIS CENTRAL EQUITY HOLDER IN THIS WHOLE PUZZLE IF WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA SOLVE ALL THESE CRISES. IT HAS TO COME FROM THE COMMUNITY THE STEWARDS IN WHATEVER PLACE THEY LIVE AND THE- MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND AND DIDN'T ISOLATE THEM NOT JUST FROM OTHER BUT ALSO FROM THEIR NATURAL RESOURCES IS REALLY- A WASTE OF HUMAN POTENTIAL IN THIS STATE- I READ THE SAME ARTICLE CENTER HUESO AND- YOU KNOW IT IT HARKEN BACK TO- THE THIRTIES IN THIS COUNTRY AND- AND A TIME THEN WERE THERE WAS THE THREAT OF A LOST GENERATION. AND PRESERVATION LAUNCH THE CONSERVATION CORPS. MEN THEY PLANTED BILLIONS OF TREES AND PUT A WHOLE GENERATION TO WORK IN. THE NIGHT I FRANKLY THINK THAT- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY BIG RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO DO SOMETHING INCREMENTAL I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE- YOU'VE SORT OF. ACCEPTED THAT CHALLENGE IN A WAY AND REALLY TRIED TO EXPAND THIS TO MAKE IT STATE WIDE TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE VISION I THINK. EVEN IF YOU ALL LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECTS- DON'T JUST THINK OF THIS AS A TREE ARMY- WHICH WE DO NEED TO TACKLE THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND- ALL THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT THAT IMPOSE BUT- THIS IS ALSO ABOUT DISASTER RECOVERY IN. AND RISK THIS IS ABOUT- DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS OF THE DROUGHT. OR WILD FIRES THESE ARE ALL VERY REAL THINGS AND I THINK IN ALL HIGH SCHOOLERS WHO JUST WENT THROUGH THEIR GRADUATION CEREMONIES AND MAYBE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE NOT KNOWING WHERE THE BRIDGES- THIS IS THE YEAR TO BUILD THAT I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY. GIVEN THAT. THE DIFFICULT IN THE BUDGET IS A POLICY BILL BUT THE COMMUNITY ACCESS AND NONPROFIT FUNDING THAT WAS SET ASIDE FROM THE BOND IN SIXTY EIGHT WAS CUT FROM THE BUDGET. AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BOND PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE AND WE MOVED OUT OF OUR HOUSE- THAT THAT. WOULD FIND EXACTLY THIS KIND OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND I JUST. REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH FUNDING THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S CRUCIAL TO ARCHITECT THE VISION AND SAID AND- I REALLY LAY OUT SOME HOPE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE SO- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR TO THE MEASURE- AND LOOK. FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS THIS GOES FORWARD I APPRECIATE THE DIVERSITY OF THE COALITION YOU BUILT TO REALLY STRETCHING BEYOND JUST LA AND- WE KNOW OUR NEEDS ARE HUGE BUT- THEY'RE THEY'RE EVERYWHERE SO THANK YOU SENATOR AS ALL OF YOU TO CLOSE. YOU KNOW I THIS CAME TO ME BECAUSE I WAS OUT YOU KNOW WITH. PEOPLE AND MEETING PEOPLE WITH FRIENDS OF THE LA RIVER AND THE NEW STATE HISTORIC PARK. AND THEN I HAD VISITS FROM.

YOU KNOW SUMMER JOBS LIKE WHY NOT HAVE A REAL CAREER WHY CAN'T THEY ENVISIONED THEMSELVES AS A- ENVIRONMENTAL IS FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WORKING CLASS AND POOR COMMUNITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATED ME. THEN YOU KNOW. THE EXPERTS TURNED IT INTO A BILL BUT THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATED ME SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND- AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I URGE IN MY BOOK.

ALL MEMBERS OF THAT THAT WORKING GROUP FOR THEIR INPUT IN THE PROCESS- THE BILL IS QUITE PERSONAL IT IT IT'S TECHNICAL TOO BUT- IT GETS DOWN TO. THE REASON PEOPLE LOSE EVERYTHING IN OUR WILD FIRES AND- SOME SEEMINGLY VERY BASIC AND SIMPLE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT WE JUST CAN'T. FIND A WAY- TO DO EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS- TO COMMUNITY BASIS AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE A CRISIS IN NOT JUST WILD FIRES INVULNERABILITY BUT ALSO IN THE INSURANCE MARKETS AND THAT SORT OF GENERAL RISK. CLIMATE THAT- IS INTOLERABLE IT'S A BUDGET RISK TO WE MAY GET BLIND SIDED pEVEN LATER THIS YEAR.

THANK YOU MODERATOR WELL I GUESS WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS FOR- COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS THAT WISH TO SHARE A SINNER BEARABLE AND THEN CENTER MONEY. SENATOR STERN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT IS OBVIOUSLY A- AN ISSUE THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO TACKLE- ARE WILDFIRE RISK GOES UP EVERY YEAR. AND WE'VE PLACE PEOPLE ARE WE'VE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO BUILD IN AREAS THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE QUITE FRANKLY SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT AFTER THE FACT BECOMES A CHALLENGE BUT- I AM I WANT TO MAKE SURE I. I UNDERSTAND IT IF THERE IS A BUNCH OF MOVING PIECES SO- I APOLOGIZE IF THIS SEEMS DISJOINTED BUT- BUT AS I WAS READING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS- I JUST WASN'T SURE EXACTLY WHAT. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS. WHAT ARE WE GIVING WHAT AUTHORITY ARE WE GIVING TWO DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS HOW. ARE RESIDENT SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO THIS ON A FORTY AND THEN WHO'S PAYING FOR IT RIGHT- AND ON AND ON UNDER THE PROPOSED A LOT. THE LINE UNDER UNDER NUMBER. THREE IT IT IT THE SENTENCE DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT USING A MASK AND INHALING LIKE CARBON MONOXIDE FOR FIVE HOURS ADULTS OF THE BRAIN BUT WHEN IT SAYS THAT THAT- THAT CAL FIRE CAN DEVELOPING PROPOSED FOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR CONSIDERATION A FINANCIAL PENALTY STRUCTURE TO APPLY TO LAND OWNERS. FOR WHOM THE DIRECTOR HAS AUTHORIZED THE REMOVAL OF VEGETATION IN CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE DEFENSE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENT AND IS MADE THE EXPENSE OF THE REMOVAL A LEAN UPON THE PROPERTY IS PROVIDED SO. HOW CAN READ IT HOW CAN. THE DIRECTOR AUTHORIZE THE INCONSISTENT WITH UP- I SEE I GET IT WELL JUST NEED TO READ IT LIKE TEN TIMES SO MY CAN MY CONCERN IS THIS- CAL FIRE SAYS THE THESE ARE THE TREES IT NEED TO BE REMOVED HERE'S THE BRUSH YOU NEED TO GET RID OF AND THEY LOCAL COUNTY ORDINANCE SAYS THOU SHALT NOT TAKE OUT ANY TREES THAT WE DON'T. GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO SO HOW DOES IT WORK WITH. WITH THAT THE- THOSE CHALLENGES WHERE. YOU KNOW LOCAL ENTITIES WANT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP. AT BOTH NUMBER ONE LOCAL ENTITIES BUT TO THERE'S THIS POLICY OF. BEING GREEN AND THE GREEN IS MORE TREES AND- AND TAKING. CARBON OUT OF THE AT THE CARBON SAID SEQUESTRATION. IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT- AND THEN. THE. THE OTHER PART OF IT IS. WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM. AND I HAVE A HARD TIME QUITE FRANKLY NOW THAT WE'RE DOING BUDGETS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE PEOPLE TAKING OUT TREES THAT ARE THAT LIVE IN WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL AND WE DO A GRANT PROGRAM SO WE CAN TAKE THAT STUFF OUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING MONEY INTO SOCIAL SERVICES OR INTENT HEALTH THEIR- HEALTHCARE THAT KIND OF THING SO IF YOU COULD TALK TO BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES I- UPS OF COURSE. TO THE VISION YOU WERE REFERRING TO IS A- IS A STUDY IN PROPOSED KIND OFPROVISION IT'S NOT A ACTUAL ENACTMENT OF ANY PENALTY STRUCTURES I THINK THE WAY IT'S DRAFTED IT. HERE'S TO WOULD BE UP FULL. DEFENSIBLE SPACE CODE IS SO THAT WOULD. DELEGATE DOWN DATE TO COUNTIES SO IF COUNTIES HAD. YOU YOU YOU SINCE SOME KIND OF THIS ALREADY EXISTS RIGHT. OKAY THAT'S HOW THE ADMINISTERED I THINK THE IDEA WOULD BE IS THERE IS THERE SOME OTHER STRUCTURE THAT CAL FIRE WANTS TO COME UP WITH THE OFFER TO THE COUNTIES. AS SOME KIND OF ENFORCING MECHANISM BUT WE DON'T. YOU ONLY HAVE TO CROSS THE BRIDGE WITH THIS OF. STUDYING AT CONS NOT NECESSARILY AN ACTING IT BUT I. THE NUYS THAT THAT TO END IT IS VERY MUCH. ALL TO ME TWO IS WHEN THEY COME KNOCKING YOUR DOOR MAY YOU CAN'T THE LAN. YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH IT OR YOUR YOU CAN BLOCK FOR OTHER REASONS- BUT I KNOW CENTER BONDING IS SIMPLER CONCERNS IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHERE. YOU GOT A PROJECT YOU WANT TO DO WHICH AGAIN BLOCKED FOR SOME REASON SO I APPRECIATE THAT SENSITIVITY BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL STRUCTURE IS A- LOCAL. LOCAL ORDINANCES TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WE DO NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THOUGH IN THE IN THE IT IN THE BILL I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE- COURT. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A MODEST AMOUNT I THINK IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION- WORK- I WOULD SAY THAT PRIVATE LANDOWNERS ARE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY SAID DIDN'T EAT IT'S MORE TO MANAGE OUR LIABILITY ON OUR PUBLIC LANDS BUT ALSO. THE UNFORTUNATE FEDERAL LANDS- ARE ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES OUT THERE SO RIGHT NOW CAL FIRE GRANTS ARE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED TO GO SUBSIDIZE FEDERAL PLANS WHICH I FURTHER CAN'T GET MY HEAD AROUND. WE WANT TO WRITE IT UP AND SORT OF ON THOSE AREAS. OF FINANCIAL IN CAPACITY ALSO SUPER RICH AND I THINK RIGHT TO RAISE THOSE EQUITY CONCERNS I THINK THAT'S GOT THE LANDS WHICH WITH LOOK AT IT THIS. THE WHILE THE ERROR RESERVE BON DOES PROVISIONS IN IT THAT THAT WOULD SORT OF ADD SOME FUNDING STREAM TO THAT- BUT WE CAN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS SORT OF EQUITY PIECE OF IT BECAUSE I ALSO YOU KNOW I COME FROM ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES IN MALIBU RIGHT NOW WHO BURNED DOWN BUT MALIBU ALSO THERE. IS THIS IN HERE IN THERE YOU KNOW RETIRED TEACHERS IN NURSING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BUT FOR THE MOST PART. SENATE INCREDIBLY WEALTHY COMMUNITY THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE SUBSIDIZING. THEIR RISK GUY THERE SO AS AS I LOVE. MY PEOPLE FACT OF THE INS FOR THE- AROUND HOLDING MISSIONS ON PRINCIPLES CAME FROM FRIENDS OF MINE FOR MICE. WHO LOST THEIR HOME THERE WAS A GARDEN HOSE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR FRIENDS. HOME UP IN YOU KNOW WE ALL LOST A LOT THEN AND SO. I DISSED I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE TOO PRECIOUS AND IT'S GOT TO BE FOCUSED ON TARGETED SO. LET'S LET'S TAKE IT. WITH YOU AND JUST MAKE SURE WHATEVER'S GOING INTO A PROCS. HAS THAT SORT OF. THAT AND- BECAUSE WE- ARE THERE'S NO PROCREATION IN BILL. IT THERE'S NO WAX. YEAH TING SCHEMA AT THE IT'S MY SO ABOUT THE BUILDING STANDARD PIECE. AND REALLY THE CAL THE EXISTING CAL GRANTS BELIEVE THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAT'S ABOUT TO GO OUT. TO REFINE THAT REALLY FOCUS IT IN THESE AREAS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING IT. SO YEAH I JUST THINK THAT WITH THEIR THAT AS WE STARTLOOKING AT SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE. CHANGE THAT WE ALSO LOOK AT. LOS BURDEN THAT WE SHOULD AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR RISK RISK- LIKE BUILDING ON A CLIFF. OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN AND YES SALUTE YOU KNOW THEY GET REIMBURSEMENT AND THAT THAT KIND OF THING. BUT AND THEN SO THE AND I JUST WANTED TO OPEN THAT DISCUSSION BUT ON. ALSO IN REGARDS TO THE TRIENNIAL BUILDING CODE- THE BILL INTO PAGE ONE YEAR TO GET THE- THE WORK DONE AND I'M NOT SURE I WOULD I WOULD ASK YOU TO CHECK. IN WITH THAT BILL STANDARDS COMMISSION. BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE AS A CHAIR OF THAT ORGANIZATION FOR. A WHILE IT TAKE I HAVE A LITTLE COMMENT ON THAT SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN. GRAHAM VERY CLOSELY WITH BOTH. THE FIRE MARSHAL BUILDING STANDARDS SO I THINK THIS. IS A IT. THIS IS. BUT IT'S ALL IT'S A WITH THE FI CODE NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSLATING SOME OF THAT OVER TO THE BUILDING STANDARDS CAN THAT'S WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS IT HAS TO ALREADY BE IN SOMETHING IN ORDER. TO GET TO THEM FOR THAT YEAH NOTE THAT THE APPRECIATE THE DETAIL HERE AND I WOULD JUST SAY ON THAT BUILDING INTO THE RISK ISSUE LOOK WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A TOUGH DEBATE THIS YEAR'S PURRS AS- GOING INTO THE HOUSING CONVERSATION. WE WANT TO SAY YES. BE CAREFUL WHERE WE SAY YES AND FRANKLY I MEAN I'VE GOT CONCERNS ABOUT AROUND. JUST THROWING NEW HOUSING UP IN IN THESE. VERY NARROW CANYONS IN AREAS WHERE. CAL FIRES ALREADY SAID OR LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE SAID. THIS IS SUPER HIGH RISK BUT YET. YOU KNOW YOU WANT THE FANCY HOME UP THERE YOU WANT FOR EVEN THE A DO YOU FRANKLY I THINK WE'VE- TO BE. SORT OF. EQUALLY RIGID ABOUT NEW GROWTH INTO THE WILL BE SO I AGREE WITH YOU THERE. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. CLEAN UPS THE STAFF DOES GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T. INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES- SET. UP HERE YEAH CEREMONY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THINK- CHAIR STERN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN IS YOUR REFERENCE WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THIS EARLIER. I DO AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS OF MY CALLING SENATOR CAFIERO. SO IN. IN A DISTRICT IT'S LARGELY RURAL THAT I REPRESENT WE HAVE INTERFACE OF SOME LARGE POPULATIONS WITH WILD LANDS- PRONE TO WILD FIRE CALPERS JUST DECLARED IMAGE STARTED RAIN SHOWERS THAT WE ARE OFFICIALLY ANSWERING FIRE SEASON- SOME OF THE RANGE WE AT EARLIER HAVE JUST. FUELED GROWTH SOME OF FUEL AREAS YOU MADE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TIMBER REMOVAL IN THE SEARS AND SOME OF OUR STATE WE'RE GOING INTO FEDERAL LANDS I WOULD SHARE YOUR CONCERN THAT. FEDERAL DOLLARS SHOULD BE. DETECTING FEDERAL LANCER DOING APPROPRIATE CLEARANCE- THE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT. HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE BEEN THWARTED IN TRYING TO JUST BUILD THEIR OWN- BUT FOR SPACES AROUND THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS- EITHER THE COUNTY OR THE STATE LEVEL SO. I WOULD JUST SAYS THAT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENTS IF YOU FACE THIS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THOSE THAT WANT TO SELF HELP TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR NEIGHBORS. CAN'T DO IT. AND SO WE'VE HAD THE UNDER THE DECLARATION OF. EMERGENCY AUTHORITY BY THE GOVERNOR. OVER THE LAST YEAR- THERE WERE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SITES THIRTEEN YEAR TWENTY EIGHT OR THIRTY SIX SIR NUMBER OF SITES AROUND THE STATE. FOR PRIORITY. MAINTENANCE AND CLEARANCE USING CAL FIRE CREWS SOME OF THOSE WERE IN MONTEREY COUNTY- BUT- IS STILL THE PROBLEM I SEE HERE THAT I HEAR ABOUT FROM CONSTITUENTS IS. WE WANT TO CLEAR SPACE AND WE CAN'T GET THE PERMITTING. BUT SO. WE CAN WORK ON THAT TOGETHER IS THIS MOVES FORWARD WELCOME ANY COMMENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THAT. THANK YOU CEREMONY- I HAVE A SHARE THE SAME- ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE AND IN MY COMMUNITY AND- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- IN THE NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING- AS WELL AS THE ROLL OUT OF THEIR VEGETATION. AND PROGRAM HOW FIRES PROPOSED A BROADER FRAMEWORK THAT AT- SOME OPPOSITION AND- IS CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED- IN TERMS OF WHAT OVERALL STATE PROGRAM. TWO FOUR RATIONALIZE OUR STATE SHE'S WITH. ISSUES IT IS AN AREA FRAUGHT WITH PERIL I WOULD SAY LOCAL AND TELL YOU IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET THROUGH AND REALLY HAVE IT BEING. WHEN I TRY TO BROUGHT ONE. PLAN FOR THE STATE. IS GOING TO BE CRUCIAL SO THAT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE WE'VE HAD A WERE DISASTER COMING THERE'S A HILLSIDE IT'S A BUT YOU THAT YOU'VE GOT A CLEAR IT- AND THERE ARE PROVISIONS UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT THAT CAN BE WAIT- WHETHER THEY'RE BEING EXERCISED IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER AND REALLY DONE. WITH AN EYE FOR THAT HAVE A TERRORIST NATION BUT BUT WITH THE COPS EFFORT TO SAY. WE NEED TO FIND SOME IN SOME THIRD PATH HERE I THINK. WE GET. THE KINDS OF PROJECTS YOUR TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF- CLEARANCES AND HOME HARDENING. WE JUST CUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE BUDGET FOR THAT PROGRAM- OR WE DIDN'T THAT IT WAS PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISED- THE GOVERNOR UP TO A PLAN FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WRIT LARGE. DAHLE SOME OF THE ISSUES. WE'VE ALREADY GOT THAT ARE SENATE BOND WE'VE GOTTA HOME HARDENING- PLAN IN THERE SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE PATHWAYS TO GETTING THIS WORK DONE. BUT THE CURRENT APPROACH AT LEAST IS REALLY NOT AS FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT RIGHT AROUND THE- IT'S MUCH SO WAY LIKE FOR UNDER THE WILD IT PREVENTING THOSE MEGA FIRES AND SO. WE GOT. IT'S NOT. WE GOT A- WE CAN'T BURNED THE NORTH ELLEN LEAVE THE SOUTH OR VICE VERSA AND WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER SO ANYWAY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE PROCESS AND- SHE THE URGENCY ALL THIS. SO HABITS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT MR STERN YOU MAY CLOSE ON THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO.
