TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT ON SB SIX NINETY TWO. INDIVIDUALS USING A VIDEO RELAY SERVICE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT SHOULD CALL. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE FIVE FOUR NINE ZERO AND THE ACCESS CODE IS EIGHT NINE EIGHT SEVEN NINE TWO SEVEN. SENATOR CORTESE YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION ON SIX NINETY TWO WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MANCHURIAN AND NORTH SENATORS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB SIX NINETY TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION INCLUSION ACT. THE BILL WAS FORMED IN CONSULTATION WITH AND WITH INPUT PROVIDED BY NUMEROUS PARENTS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUPS SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPERTS TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AMONG OTHERS. INCLUSION OR PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO LEARNING GAUGE WITH THE CONGRESS IN GENERAL EDUCATION COSTELLO. HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO INCREASE ACADEMIC IN GRADUATION OUTCOMES FOR NOT ONLY SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS BUT ALL STUDENTS. STATES THAT HAVE INCREASED INCLUSION- BAND L. R. E. RATES OVER THE LAST DECADE HAVE SEEN PARABLE INCREASES IN THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THIS INCLUDES MASSACHUSETTS NEW JRSEY AND FLORIDA AMONG OTHERS. YOU'RE CALIFORNIA ONLY 53% OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SPENT A MAJORITY OF THEIR SCHOOL DAY IN GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM THAT'S FAR BELOW. OTHER STATES IN IS FAR BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S MADE ALMOST NO PROGRESS TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES. THIS IS ALL THE MORE CONCERNING CONSIDERING THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN OUR STATE SCORED ON AVERAGE EIGHTY EIGHT POINTS. IN A ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN POINTS BELOW STANDARD ON STATE STANDARDIZED ENGLISH MATH ASSESSMENTS RESPECTIVELY. BY ADDING AN EGG IN EXISTING FEDERAL INCLUSION. FOUR IN OTHER WORDS LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT TARGET THAT BEING A TERM OF ART TO THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY DASHBOARD FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND AWARENESS OF INCLUSIVE OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. IT WOULD DISINCENTIVE EYES DISTRICTS FROM INAPPROPRIATELY PLACING THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS INTO SEGREGATED CLASSROOMS. THAT BEING SAID- I'M I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AGAIN L. O. R. E. SORT OF AN ACRONYM FOR EVERY STUDENT- MAY NOT BE A GENERAL EDUCATION SETTING SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT IN I. E. P. AN INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM TEAM AND FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THAT WON'T CHANGE UNDER THIS BILL. THIS BILL WOULD ONLY ADD BUT WHAT'S KNOWN AS INDICATOR FIVE EIGHTY TO THE STATE DASHBOARD AS A LOCAL MEASURE. THE MEASURE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AGES SIX THROUGH TWENTY TWO WHO SPENT TIME INSIDE THE STANDARD CLASSROOM FOR AT LEAST 80% OF THE SCHOOL DAY. BY DOING THIS THE BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO OFFER MORE INCLUSIVE OPTIONS TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. INCENTIVIZE DISTRICTS USE EXISTING RESOURCES TO PROVIDE GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WITH TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TEACHING STRATEGIES AND FRAMEWORKS OPTIMIZE EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL LEARNING DIFFERENCES. THIS BILL SB SIX NINETY TWO WILL THEREBY BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE THROUGH INCLUSION TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA VALUES OF INCLUSION UNDERSTANDING AND EQUITY. BEFORE INTRODUCED MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WANT TO MAKE NOTE. THAT I'VE SUBMITTED AUTHOR AMENDMENTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY ADVOCATES ORGANIZATIONS AND LEADERS PROTECTING THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY THE BLIND COMMUNITY AND THE DELPHI COMMUNITY. SOME ARE HERE TODAY- AND WILL ALSO BE TESTIFIED. THE BILL BE PROVIDING TESTIMONY I BELIEVE WITH THE NEUTRAL STANCE AS OF TODAY MY OFFICE IN A BILL SPONSOR THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. IT IS A HAS BEEN WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION CONVERSATION WITH THEM. THE AMENDMENTS MADE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM SERVE TO MAKE CLARIFICATIONS TO ADDRESS WHAT WERE THEIR INITIAL CONCERNS REGARDING THIS BILL. SO WANT TO MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT ALTER THE RIGHTS OF DEAF DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING BLIND OR DEAF BLIND STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. NOR WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS OR SPECIALTY PROGRAMS THAT SERVE LOW INCIDENCE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND SPECIALTY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THOSE. DO NOT HAVE AN INDICATOR FIVE. AND WE COLLATE A SAID EARLIER THIS BILL UP ONLY- MODIFIES INDICATOR FIVE EIGHT THEY DO NOT HAVE AN INDICATOR FIVE BILLION OR NOT INCLUDED IN THIS FOR REPORTING OR ACCOUNTABILITY. THE MINUTES MADE TO THE BILL SERVE TO CLARIFY THAT IN A I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WORKED WITH ME IN OUR OFFICE. TO MAKE THIS CLEAR IN THE BILL LANGUAGE. WITH US TODAY IS DOCTOR MILLION TO ONE THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. BUT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IN KEVIN SCHAEFER DIRECTOR OF THE SUPPORTING INCLUSIVE PRACTICES PROJECT. OF THE OLD RUNDLE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AGAIN BUT BOTH ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND RESPECTFULLY ON TH AS FOR RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE WE WILL NOW GO TO OUR LEAD SUPPORT DR MERION TO ONE AND KEVIN SHAFFER I THINK- DOCTORED TO ONE YOU'RE GOING FIRST. YEAH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M I'M BACK TO MARION TO LINE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. WE ARE REALLY PROUD TO SPONSOR SENATE BILL SIX NINETY TWO I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR DEEP APPRECIATION TO SENATOR KERR CATHY FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THAT PRIORITIZES EQUITY AND INCLUSION BUT OUR COLORS AT THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. I STARTED MY CAREER AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER AND I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THAT INCLUDING CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF A STUDENT BY. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES YOU ARE INCLUDED IN GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES ARE MORE LIKELY. TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL STAY ON TRACK WITH THEIR PEERS. AND ENGAGE IN THE WORK FORCE. THIRTY YEARS OF EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR AND CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP. NGUYEN INCLUSION AND IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICES AND ACADEMIC GRADUATION AND EMPLOYMENT THANK THAT. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA HAS NOT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT MOVES. TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION OR INCLUSIVE BACK. THE NATIONAL RATE OF AN FOR STUDENTS THAT THE THAT 63% HOWEVER CALIFORNIA IN. ONLY FIFTY THREE PER OF OURS WHAT DOES THE AND GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES. WE INDICATES THAT IS A OR- BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S FAILURE TO PRIORITIZE INCLUSION AND THE FACT THAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES PERFORM WORSE ON STANDARDIZED TESTS. THAN ANY OTHER SUBGROUP INCLUDING LOW INCOME STUDENT. SENATE BILL SIX NINETY TWO WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT 1100% OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THE INCLUDED A SUPPORT DISTRICTS TO EXPAND INCLUSION AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES PLAN FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND DEVOTE EXISTING RESOURCES. TOWARDS PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND MORE OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH IEPS. WE AT THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION BELIEVE THAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL MEMBERS. OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION COMMUNITY AND THEREFORE SHOULD HAVE. EQUAL ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE EDUCATION WITH THEIR PEERS. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT EQUITY AND INCLUSION BY VOTING YES ON SENATE BILL SIX NINETY TWO. THANK YOU. MISTER SCHAEFFER.

OUR MISSION IS TO SUPPORT LEADERSHIP TEAMS IN THEIR INTENTIONAL DESIGN AND REDESIGN INCREASED MEANINGFUL INCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION INDICATOR FIVE EIGHT WHICH IS AT THE CENTER OF THIS BILL. ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AGO I WAS A STUDENT WITH A DISABILITY WHO EXPERIENCED EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICES AS WELL AS THE AFTER TAX. FIFTY YEARS AGO AND IT'S STILL FAR TOO OFTEN WE CONTINUE TO EDUCATE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN SEGREGATED SETTINGS AND TO WHAT END. EVEN TODAY ROUGHLY HALF OF THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE EDUCATED IN SEPARATE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THIS SEGREGATION IN MOST CASES NEGATIVELY IMPACTS POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND LIMITS CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. WE MUST DO BETTER AND DOING BETTER INCLUDES ADDING INDICATOR FIVE A LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT DATA AS A REQUIRED AND TRANSPARENT MEASURE ON THE CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTABILITY DASHBOARD. THIS STILL ALLOWS FOR THE INDIVIDUALIZED PLACEMENT DECISIONS MADE BY I EAT P. TEAMS TO BE FRONT AND CENTER AS OPPOSED TO AN ABLEIST AFTERTHOUGHT OR STYLO DISTRICT PLANNING CONVERSATION. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW NECESSARY INCLUSION IN IT AND HAVE DEDICATED MY CAREER TO A FEW CREATING MORE INCLUSIVE LEARNING SPACES THAT ALL STUDENTS DESERVE.

THANK THE CHAIR FOR ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PUBLIC PROCESS I THINK THIS IS OUTSTANDING- I'M AND I DO HAVE A COMMON SUPPORT YOUR BILL I WANTED TO SHARE THOUGH- I'M ACTUALLY HEARING IMPAIRED I'D BUY. AND WEARING HEARING AIDS RIGHT NOW- AND I. IN THE PROCESS OF IT SO I WANT TO GIVE A CLARIFICATION IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER SEEN A NEUTRAL POSITION THAT WE'VE ALLOWED SO IT REALLY. I THINK BRINGS TO LIGHT SOME OF THE- MAYBE SOME OF THE DIRECTION THE BILL MAY NEED TO GO- SO I JUST WANNA SHARE MY OWN EXPERIENCE- SUCCESS WE'VE HAD COBIT. SO I WEAR HEARING AIDS I. DID NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH I READ LIPS UNTIL EVERYBODY WAS WEARING A MASK. OKAY AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT I HAVE SINUS PROBLEMS SO. THE DIFFICULTY OF WEARING A MASK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY MOST YOU DON'T KNOW I SAID IN THE BACK ROOM WITH THE BOX AROUND YOU SO THAT I CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THIS THING DOWN AND BREED. ONCE IN A WHILE TO TRY TO KEEP MY SINUSES CLEAR. THE MASK ALSO CAUSES MOVEMENT WHEN YOU TALK AND YOU GET BACK IN YOUR EAR SO- I'M JUST SHARE A LITTLE BIT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE HEARING IMPAIRED AND ARE TRYING TO BE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY SHOULD BE IN I BELIEVE WHICH IS IN THE NORMAL. CLASSROOM SO CAN YOU MAYBE HELP ME FIGURE OUT- WHAT WHAT THE ISSUE IS WITH THE NEUTRALS AND WHAT AND WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE INCLUDE THESE. STUDENTS AND- OR OR- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAWSUIT CAN YOU HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT ON WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- INCLUDED. OR ARE THEY ALREADY I DON'T KNOW THAT. YES OF THE MANAGER YES PLEASE THANK YOU- YES THIS IS THE FIRST OF ALL I TO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE INVOLVED IN- CREATING ACCESSIBILITY HERE TODAY THE OPPOSITE THAT PROBABLY ALL FUEL SHOULD ALWAYS BE. THE CASE AND ALWAYS BE PRESENT- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR SHARING YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCE OF WITH US- WHAT HAPPENED THE ISSUE THAT REALLY- PROVOKED A LOT OF THE- ON THIS BILL. EARLIER IN A GOOD WAY- UNINTENTIONALLY BUT IN A GOOD WAY IN TERMS OF ONGOING DIALOGUE. WAS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS FEDERAL INDICATOR THAT. ESSENTIALLY WE'RE BRINGING OVER- AS AS A AS A TARGET FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. AND LOCAL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. QUOTE WE BY SHORTHAND RECALLING FIVE A LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT- WHETHER OR NOT THAT APPLIES. A CROSS THE BORDER TO DISABLED STUDENTS OR NOT AND THAT WAS PARTICULARLY OF CONCERN- FORWARD. THE COMMUNITY THAT WE JUST HEARD FROM HE WAS SPEAKING FROM A SAMPLE OF NEUTRALITY BECAUSE IN EFFECT THE THEY DID NOT WANT TO APPLY BECAUSE WHAT FIVE THEY WOULD DO IS INCENTIVIZE- IT POPULATING CLASSROOMS YOU KNOW BY INCLUSION- THAT COULD IN THEORY INTERFERE WITH SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES- FOR THE DEAF COMMUNITY- IT AND OTHERS WHERE WERE GROUP ACTIVITIES ARE ARE ACTUALLY VERY VERY CONDUCIVE. TO FURTHERING EDUCATION. THE BILL FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T MANDATE ANY POPULATION QUOTAS FOR REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE IT STILL RELIES ON THE INDIVIDUAL I E. P. P. THE- R. M. THE IN THE IEP PLAN THAT SET UP BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS AND THE PARENTS FOR THE CHILDREN AS AS THE FINAL- SORT OF DEMARCATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT STUDENT WHETHER THEY ARE ARE PUT INTO A MAINSTREAM CLASSROOM WITH THEIR PUT IN ALL DAY. WHETHER THEY'RE NOT PUTTING ALL DAY ALL THAT'S IN THE I. E. P. IN THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT PROCESS AT ALL SO THAT'S REALLY. WHERE THE DECISIONS WILL ACTUALLY BE MADE BUT BACK TO- WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM- I THINK THE MOST THE NEUTRAL TESTIMONY WE WERE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSE THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED- AT THE RISK OF PUTTING WORDS IN THEIR MOUTH BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS FIVE EIGHT INDICATOR DIDN'T CAPTURE. THERE COMMUNITY THERE'S THEIR STUDENTS THEIR KIDS- IN IN. IN THE INCLUSION TARGETS SO WE ARE TRYING TO GET INCLUSION UP BY ABOUT 10% IN CALIFORNIA FROM 53% ON AVERAGE TO. CLOSER 263% WHICH IS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- IN. WITHOUT MANDATING THAT JUST BY BRINGING THIS THIS LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT TARGET AND PUTTING ON A DASHBOARD WORDS IT'S THE TRANSPARENCY WORDS HOW ARE WE DOING- THE BELIEF IS THAT WILL LEAD TO. TRAINING THERE'S ONGOING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT KIND OF TRAINING. THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AS ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT TYPE OF TRAINING- SO WE SO WE THINK THE PIECES ARE THERE TO START MOVING THAT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING PUT IN ORDER TO. FOR NOW SATISFIED IN- CONCLUDED CENTER TO SATISFY. THOSE VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERN AND REQUESTS FOR CLARIFICATION- WE WENT BACK IN IN DRAFTED WITH THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. OF VERY VERY SPECIFIC. UNAMBIGUOUS AMENDMENTS THAT- WE WERE HAPPY TO BRING IN THE BASICALLY SAY THIS INDICATOR WILL NOT. APPLY TO THEM. GOOD TO THE COMMUNITY OF OPPORTUNITY COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY SCHOOLS DEAF BLIND BUT DEAF BLIND- AND SO FORTH SO. I DON'T WANT IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO EXTEND THE HURRY TO LONG BUT- IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT- IN THE BILL AN AMENDMENT THAT'S MARKED- SEE. TWO LITTLE EYES IT STARTS OFF OF LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AS MEASURED BY FEDERAL INDICATOR FIVE EIGHTY IT GOES ON TO SAY. THAT- THIS MANAGEMENT SHALL NOT INCLUDE STUDENTS WHO ARE DEAF HARD OF HEARING BLIND VISUALLY IMPAIRED AND DEAF BLIND. AND THEN IT OES ON TO SAY THAT IT WILL ALSO NOT IMPACT ANY OF THE RULES AROUND IDPS RIGHT NOW SO WE WANTED TO DO IS BE VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THAT IN THE BILL EVEN THOUGH FIVE EIGHT DOESN'T. ORDINARILY INCLUDE THE POPULATION ANYWAY WE WANTED AB LANGUAGES SAYS. AND THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY CARDS OUT. OF THAT COMMUNITY. I THINK IT'S BEEN A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY IF I COULD JUST SAY FOR THE FOR- THE COMMUNITY- AROUND. THE TOUGH BLIND DEAF BLIND. COMBINED FOR THAT COMMUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THE PASSION. THAT HAS ARRIVED AT THE CAPITOL AROUND THESE ISSUES ALMOST FEELS LONG OVERDUE AND IT AND I HOPE.

WELCOME SENATOR LEYVA YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL ON SB THREE SIX THREE THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS SENATE BILL THREE SIX THREE FURTHERS CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF PROVIDING EQUAL EDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL STUDENTS BY REPEALING THE AMERICAN LEGION'S EXCEPTION TO THE SEX DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THE AMERICAN LEGION DOES NOT FACILITATE OR SPONSOR PROGRAM THAT DISCRIMINATES BASED ON GENDER. A GIRL CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE AND GIRLS STATE PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO IMPART A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF GOVERNMENT AND CIVIC RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE PRIVILEGES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEMOCRACY. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HELD THAT ACCESS TO EDUCATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FOR ALL PERSONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER. ASSEMBLY YOUNG WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN CALIFORNIA GIRL STATE ARE NOT AFFORDED COMPATIBLE CIVICS EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AS YOUNG MEN IN CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE. EVERY YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PANDEMIC APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND YOUNG MEN PARTICIPATE IN BOYS STATE VISIT SACRAMENTO AND THE STATE CAPITAL DURING THE SUMMER. CALIFORNIA GIRLS STATE WITH A NINETEEN EIGHT AS EIGHTIES ERA CAP OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO PARTAKE IN SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF CIVIC EDUCATION. BUT ARE NOT AFFORDED THE SAME ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO THE GOVERNMENT AS BOYS HEALTH MOST NOTABLY IN COMING TO SACRAMENTO AND VISITING THEIR STATE CAPITOL. ONE CANNOT DENY THAT THE PRESENCE IN SACRAMENTO AFFORD OPPORTUNITIES THAT STUDENTS MAY NOT OTHERWISE HEALTH. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AN ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTING A BOISE STATE ALUM FROM SAN MARINO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HE TALKS ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CHAMBERS IN THE STANLEY MOSK LIBRARY AND COURTS BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL AND ACTUALLY MEETING. CALIFORNIA CHIEF SUPREMUM COURT CHIEF JUSTICE TANI CANTIL SECRETARY HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW HE LEARNED ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FROM GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM ADDRESSING THE BOYS STATE CONFERENCE ALL OF WHICH HAPPENED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OTHER INEQUITIES ALSO EXIST SUCH AS APPLICATION FEES REGISTRATION FEES CAREER FAIRS AND THE LEARNING OF OUTDATED SONGS THAT FOCUS MORE ON THE APPEARANCE OF YOUNG WOMEN. ONLY THE WOMEN ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ANY FEES. WHEN WOMEN HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS SUCH AS SENATE PRO TEM TONI ATKINS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO AND LEARN DIRECTLY FROM THESE TRAILBLAZERS AS PART OF THE GIRLS STATE PROGRAM. IN THE WORDS OF SALLY RIDE THE FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE YOU CAN'T BE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE. SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED AND ARE ALSO ABLE TO VISIT THE HALLS OF POWER IN SACRAMENTO AND THE CAPITAL. FIFTY YOUNG MEN PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES STATE TO ALSO. I ALSO WANT TO OFFER THAT WE DID RECEIVE A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY INDICATING THEIR DESIRE TO BRING. THEIR GIRL STATE PROGRAM TO SACRAMENTO.

SENATOR DALY. SO I HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT- HAS WRITTEN THAT DIED AT THE TEST NAY IN THE OPPOSITION HAS MY FIRST I WANNA SAY BOTH MY SONS WENT TO BOISE AND I'M HOPING MY DAUGHTER WILL BE ABLE TO GO AND I'M HOPING TO BILL GOAL HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO I. I'M TRYING TO GRASP. I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT SO CAN YOU CAN YOU MAYBE EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ON WHERE YOU'RE HEADED OR WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS THERE SOME NEGOTIATIONS OR NOT IF WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITHOUT LEGISLATION WOULD BE AWESOME BUT I. CAN YOU MAYBE EXPAND ON A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLARS SO WE ALWAYS WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS MANY MEETINGS WITH THEM AND THIS BILL IS JUST. I WILL FIRST SAY I HAD NO IDEA THAT BRINGING PARITY TO THESE PROGRAMS WOULD BE CREATE SO MUCH OPPOSITION WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG WOMEN HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOUNG MEN HAVE. AND WHEN THIS WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION I'D SPOKEN AT A GIRL STATE- MEETING IN CLAREMONT AND THAT THE REQUISITE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SO THAT'S ALREADY YOU KNOW NOT PARITY THE BOYZ HAVE THOUGHT BUT THOUSAND. WERE THERE THEY WERE AMAZING WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND THEN WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS I WAS UP HERE AND I SEE THOUSAND BOYS RUNNING AROUND THE CAPITAL AND I'M LIKE WHERE THE GIRLS. AND THEY SAID ALL THAT YOU KNOW THE GIRLS DON'T GET TO COME TO SACRAMENTO SO I CIVIL THAT SEEMS WRONG IF YOU CAN'T SEE IT YOU CAN'T BE IT AND WE LOOK A LITTLE FURTHER INTOIT WE SEE THAT THE GIRLS HAVE TO PAY FEES THERE'S A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE IS SIXTY DOLLARS- ANOTHER FEE THAT SIXTY DOLLARS. ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE PARITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED TO THE YOUNG MEN ARE FOR TO THE YOUNG WOMEN AS YOU HEARD. ONE OF THE LEAD OPPOSITION SAY- TALKED ABOUT TWO MEN WHO ONE WAY I KNOW VERY WELL THE GREAT EXPERIENCE THEY HADAND LEAD THEM TO GOVERNMENT WE WANT YOUNG WOMEN TO SEE THEMSELVES AND GOVERNMENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO THEM AND IF WEEK WHATEVER WE CAN DO. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE GOT THE LETTER. WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE LEGISLATION TO GET THEM TO THINK. ABOUT CREATING PARITY. I DON'T KNOW IF THE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT WE WILL ALWAYS WORK WITH OPPOSITION WE BEAR MAY NOT GET THEIR BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM. THANK YOU DR PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND- A TRANSFIGURED- SERVICES ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT I MEAN FUNDAMENTALLY LEASES I READ ANALYSIS ALL THE BILL DOES IS IT SAYS THAT- WE REMOVE AN EXCEPTION TO. SEX DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS. WHAT YOU THINK INHERENTLY WHY WE CREATING EXCEPTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE MAN HEARD OPPOSITION TESTS MAY TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAM LIKE SELF DESTRUCTOR AND BUT TO ME THE- WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE I'M NOT SURE I'M CONNECTING. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S DESIRE FOR PARITY- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT EVEN THE OPPOSITION I MEAN PEOPLE POINTED OUT THEY ARE SPONSORED BY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH SO. EACH ORGANIZATION DESIGNED AROUND PROGRAM BUT THIS WOULD TO ME WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW AND MAYBE AGAIN IF I GOT A WRONG SOMEONE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IF A GIRL DECIDES THEY WANT TO GO TO VOICE BECAUSE THEY GOT A BETTER PROGRAM THAN. THEY CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE GIRLS SO- WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO PARITY ARE NOT TWO SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS TO SEPARATE SPONSORS. SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS- SHOULDN'T THE STUDENTS HAVE THE CHOICE. TO DECIDE WHICH PROGRAM THEY GO TO IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE GONNA PERSISTENT HAVING DIFFERENCES. SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE CREATING EXEMPTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO DISCRIMINATION LAWS. AND SO TO ME IT MAKES SENSE TO PUT THE STILL MAKES A LOTOF SENSE SO I'M NOT SURE OF WHERE TO DISCONNECT HIS FOR ME IN TERMS OF BY THE OPPOSITION IS SO UPSET ABOUT. REMOVING AN EXEMPTION THAT. I MEAN IF. THEY WERE STILL ON TO THE PROGRAM WE CAN DO THE PROGRAM THEY JUST CAN'T DISCRIMINATE. IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD ALL BE IN FAVOR OF THE OF SO- AND PERHAPS ON OF THE AUTHOR OR MAYBE THE LEAD OPPOSITION WANTS TO ADDRESS THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY CENTER PAM THANK YOU THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE THOUGHT TOO WE DID NOT THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE THIS MUCH OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE'VE SEEN A BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA CHANGE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AND MY- BROTHER WAS A BOY SCOUT I WANTED TO BE A BOY SCOUT. AND THEY WOULD NOT LET ME JOIN I USED TO SIT OUTSIDE THE MEETINGS AND CRY- AND NOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND THE GIRLS CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN BOY SCOUTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO EMPLOYEES CAN PARTICIPATE IN GIRL SCOUTS IF THEY SO CHOOSE. SO I THINK YOU SEEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL AND THAT'S REALLY ALL WE'RE ASKING OF OUR BOYS STATE AND THE WOMEN'S AUXILIARY TAKE A MOMENT OF INTROSPECTION. ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS PARITY. AND IF YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE ELSE. I'M NOT SURE THE LA. UP LEAD UP. IS CAN'T A DOCTOR KIMBERLY MCKINNEY IS SHE STILL ON THE LINE. JOINT ADDRESSED THE COURT YES I AM YEAH. SO WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO CREATE AN EXEMPTION TO SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. IN TERMS OF NOT HAVING DISCRIMINATION AND YOU CAN OPERATE PROGRAM HOW YOU WANT BUT YOU CAN'T SCREAM EIGHT. WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT. EIGHTY BRINGING PARITY TO THE PROGRAM AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH US SENATOR LEYVA. AND MOVING FORWARD ON BEING ABLE TO. HAVE THIS PROGRAM MOVED TO SACRAMENTO WE FULLY SUPPORT THAT AND WE- EMBRACE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR DELEGATES. Q. HAVE SOME OF THE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES THAT WERE OUTLINED TODAY. WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR THE EXEMPTION IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF THE PROGRAM BUT IT IS BECAUSE OF THE ACCESS IF WE CHOOSE TO BE A SINGLE GENDER PROGRAMS. THAT CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE SEEKTO CREATE AT GIRLS STATE THAT SUPPORTS WOMEN. AND ALLOWS THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR VOICE FREE OF. AS MALE AS DOMINANT BUT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN WE WANT TO WITH THE EXEMPTION IT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO RECRUIT THROUGH. THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IF THE EXEMPTION WAS REMOVED WE WOULD LOSE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOT ABOUT EATING SOMETHING WIDELY SAID HER GRAM SO I SEE THAT I'M SORRY. INTERRUPT BUT- WHY WOULD YOU ABILITY TO AND SO SOME DISAPPEAR IF YOU. DON'T HAVE EXEMPTS FROM. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO I DON'T SEE HOW THIS TO CONNECT. RIGHT AND I AGREE IF IT'S THE IF WORD. FOR USING THE WORD BEFORE USING DISCRIMINATION AS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR EXEMPTION FROM AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR EXEMPTION FROM WE'RE ASKING FOR EXEMPTION TO BE A SINGLE GENDER PROGRAMS THAT CAN THEN GO AHEAD. AND STILL CONTINUE TO RECRUIT AS PART OF IT THE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE. AFFORDED THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH SCHOOLS TO BRING THAT IN AND TO BRING GIRLS TO THE CAPITAL TO BRING GIRLS TO OUR PROGRAM BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN TO DEVELOP. EIGHTY EIGHT GOVERNMENT EIGHT PROGRAM A. AS- A VOICE THAT IS DONE SO IN A SAFE SPACE WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO WITH JUST WOMEN. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I AM STILL NOT SURE I SEE WHERE YOU CAN'T RECRUIT IN SCHOOLS BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT. A GIRLS ONLY PROGRAM- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I THIS THIS DEFINITELY IS A DISCUSSION THAT DESERVES TO CONTINUE- AND I THINK THAT I AM STILL VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE. I MEAN THE SUPPLIES EVERYONE ELSE INCLUDING WE TALKED ABOUT SCOUT HILLS WITH THE AUTHOR REFERRED SCOUTING AS WELL- SO- DANTE EIGHT SO I'M I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION- AND- THEY ALL RIGHT AND FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE I'M TOTALLY CONVINCED- THOSE TO THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- SO CERTAINLY- NOT ONLY MOVING FORWARD WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL- BUT- ALSO IT. OFFICIALLY THAT THE AUTHORS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR CERTAINLY. CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT THE SAID ABOUT ABOUT THE DOES THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN AND. AND THE GIRLS AND THEN OUR STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LATER HAND ADDED. BECAUSE TWO TO THREE CURRENT EXISTS FOR BOY GROUP SCOUT SCOUTS WHY AM PROGRAM AND YWCA CROWGRAMS IT'S A SEPARATE EXEMPTION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS BUT WE ALSO COMPLETELY SUPPORT SENATOR LEYVA IN HER AND IN HER EFFORTS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT SHE DOES TO. BRING GENDER PARITY AND TO DO THESE THINGS SO JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT OKAY THAT THAT CENTRALIZING IT'S NOT IN STATE LAW WE'RE WE'RE STATE LEGISLATURES THANK YOU. AT MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY. THEY CAN STILL HELP SINGLE SEX PROGRAMS IS LONG DISTANCE THERE'S SUBSTANTIALLY EQUAL ACCESS FOR BOTH SEXES OF YOU WANTED TO BREAK OUT SESSIONS THAT WERE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED MORE FUNDAMENTALLY FOR WOMEN- YOU COULD DO THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE ANY OF THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA AS SENATOR MCGUIRE. SO MUCH A MATTER VICE CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUESTION OF THE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS AND THEN A FEW QUESTIONS FOR. CARE LEAVERS WELL IF I COULD GO TO OUR LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS PLEASE. THE CHIEF COUNSELOR YES I'M HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US SO DO SO A COUPLE QUESTIONS- DID YOU ADVANCE ANY PREVIOUS LEGISLATION OR- TO BE ABLE TO BRING PARITY TO THE WOMEN'S PROGRAM. NO WE HAVE NOT. DID YOU BRING FORWARD ANY CHANGES THE WOMEN'S PROGRAM PRIOR TO THIS BILL WOULD BE IN ADVANCE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS PARITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN. IN TERMS OF THE EVOLUTION OF HOW WE- RUN OUR PROGRAMS THE THINGS THAT WE OFFER AND EXPERIENCE YES THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY GROWING AND EVOLVING AND CHANGING. THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS AND WE HAVE ADDED- COLLEGE NIGHT THAT WAS ADDED LAST YEAR DURING OUR VIRTUAL SESSION AND CONTINUES TO BE A PART OF THE PROGRAM. WE HAVE ALSO DONE AWAY WITH THE SONGS THAT WERE REFERENCED EARLIER. AND WE RESPOND TO THE FEEDBACK FROM OUR DELEGATES. AND OUR STAFF MEMBERS AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND CHANGES AND WE ARE ALWAYS SEEKING. WHERE IS THE BEST LOCATION FOR OUR PROGRAM AND WHERE WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL. WE DO BELIEVE THAT PAY TO PARTICIPATE FEES- IT'S CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THEPROGRAM SINCE BOYS DON'T HAVE TO PAY. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS ADDED D. D- FEE FOR. REGISTRATION WAS ADDED- WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND IT WAS ADDED BECAUSE AS WE HAD A NUMBER OF GIRLS WHO WERE DROPPING OUT OF THE PROGRAM THE MORNING OF AND THIS WAS ALLOWING US. TO HAVE THE DELEGATES HAVE- AND SKIN IN THE GAME IF YOU WOULD SAY SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND NOT ALLOW US TO SEE COULD DELEGATE. AND ALTERNATE IN THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF TIME. AND THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WILLING TO LOOK AT WITH THE AUTHOR AND TO REMOVE. THE WHY WHEN YOU BRING THAT UP PRIOR TO THAT JUST I'M GONNA BE CANDID THE ONLY REASON YES ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO MAKE CHANGES BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THIS LEGISLATION. IN THIS LEGISLATION IS FOCUS ON THEIR CHARGING GIRLS TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM THAT IS FREE TO VOICE WHICH IS B. CANDIDATES TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT SHOULD NEVER BE I COMPLETELY AGREE OKAY THE SECOND PIECES I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN REGARDS FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO WHEN IT COMES AND SEES YOU SYSTEM. BUT NOT HAVING GIRLS COME TO THE CAPITOL I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WAS IN ADVANCE PRIOR TO THIS LEGISLATION. BEING INTRODUCED. YES I NOT OF THE LEADERSHIP THAT MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE THE PROGRAM OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITAL. BUT I AM PART OF THE LEADERSHIP THAT IS LOOKING TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR AND SHOULD. RETURN IT TO THE CAPITAL. OKAY BUT IT. IS BECAUSE OF THIS LEGISLATION IN NOW YOU'RE OPPOSING THE LEGISLATION EVEN THOUGH YOU AGREE WITH THE MERITS OF THE LEGISLATION. SO WHAT IS IT DO YOU SUPPORT PARITY FORTY SUPPORT PARITY ON YOUR OWN TIME IN YOUR OWN AGENDA. YOU KNOW I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT PARITY IN EVERY WAY SHAPE AND FORM WHAT AYE OPPOSED IN THE WHEN WHAT THE ORGANIZATION IS ASKING FOR WITH THE EXEMPTION. IS BY REMOVING EXEMPTION TO FOR IT EXAMS. THE ORGANIZATION FROM BEING ABLE TO RECRUIT ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES. THE SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND SAID THAT IS THE ONE PIECE THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR FOR AT ON THIS BILL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK AND PROPOSED DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAT COULD. CREATE THAT AT THAT COULD REMOVE THE DISCRIMINATION WHILE STILL ALLOWING ACCESS TO THE SCHOOLS. OKAY GOTCHA I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL JUST. LAST PIECE OF STEAK- AND ALL LOOK TO THE CHAIR IS I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD TAKE LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE COMMON SENSE CHANGES TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S COMMONSENSE EQUITY BETWEEN. MEN AND WOMEN IN SOCIETY AND BEING COMPLETELY HONEST ABOUT THIS THE ONLY REASON WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIAL CHANGES CAN BECOME INTEGRAL STATE. IS BECAUSE CENTER LEYVA HAS INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION AND IS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE INEQUITIES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST THAT'S IT. AND SO RATHER THAN OPPOSED TO LEGISLATION. WHERE YOU HAVE BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS STATE OPPOSING THE LEGISLATION. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE VAST MAJORITY THE BILL THAT YOU WOULD BE EITHER NEUTRAL- AND ORDERED SUPPORTIVE WITH POTENTIAL CHANGES SO NATURALLY BY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS- LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IF THERE CAN BE SOME ADDITIONAL. WORK ON OTHER LANGUAGE BUT I THINK THE MERITS OF THIS BILL IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN. REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THAT AN ALTERNATIVE RECENTLY TO SEE SHE'S ONCE A- COMMON ANYTHING AND HE SAID. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND REQUIRE AND I THINK YOU HAVE THE SAME FEELINGS THAT WE HAD WHEN WE MOVE- INTRODUCES LEGISLATION AGAIN JUST LOOKING FOR PARITY LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOUNG WOMEN AND YOUNG MEN HAVE THE SAME ACCESS- I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION'S- RESPONSE TO THE FEES- IS REALLY ON AGAIN UNFAIR TO WOMEN THE BOYS DON'T HAVE ANY FEES I'M SURE THERE ARE BOYS THAT DROP OUT. ON THE DAY OF SO ARE WE JUST SAYING THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE UNRELIABLE AND WE HAVE TO IMPOSE A FEE ON THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY SHOW UP. I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED A CHANGE IN OUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND I HOPE THAT THIS BILL CAN GET US THERE AND AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE. THIS IS ABOUT EQUITY IT'S ABOUT PARITY YOU CANNOT SEE IT BE IT IF YOU DO NOT SEE IT. THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATE MCGUIRE AND SENATE- LEYVA. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS. OKAY I WILL SHARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON ON THE BILL I TRULY APPRECIATE THE EQUITY PART ON TRYING TO FIND AT PARITY ON THEIR- AS A MOTHER OF A DAUGHTER WHO ATTENDED BY CURE SIGNS THE ALL STATE GIRLS PROGRAM. IT WAS A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR MY DAUGHTER I KNOW THAT HER CONCERN WITH THE PROBE WAS THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND- OR GO TO SACRAMENTO SO THAT WAS THERE. HER BIGGEST COMPLAINT WITH THE PROGRAM- WHEN SHE ATTENDED AND IT REALIZED AFTERWARDS THAT THERE HER COUNTERPARTS HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND SACRAMENTO THAT WAS HER CONCERN- THE OTHER THING WITH THE FEES I DID WANT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT- FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE WAY THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS SELECTED ACTUALLY I MOVED TO A SCHOLARSHIP- IN ORDER FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE SAID THOSE FEES WERE. PROVIDED HER WERE PROVIDED TO HER BY EIGHTY. I BELIEVE. NIGHT OF PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SAY BECAUSE I'M NOT 1100% BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE SERVICE CLUBS ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR CITY THAT ALLOWED HER AND- TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND- THIS THIS COMMUNITY AND IT WAS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY- PROVIDE THIS PROGRAM. ON THERE SO I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT THAT MANY OF THESE GIRLS DO AT TEN. ON WITH A FEE BUT MANY OF THESE- ARE ALSO- COVERED BY THE SCHOLARSHIPS WITHIN THE LOCAL- SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. IN THE- IN THE AREA. AND ALSO ANOTHER OBSERVATION THAT I WANTED TO THE STATE WAS THAT- THIS ORGANIZATIONS OR THESE PROGRAMS FOR A GIRL STAYS PRIMARILY. AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. DR MCKINNEY BUT PROVIDED THROUGH THE VOLUNTEER SERVICE OF MANY MANY. WOMEN AND- AND I HAVE TO AND I'M TRYING TO FIND THE PROPER WAY OF- PRESENTING THIS FLOOD OF OLDER WISER WOMEN. WHO ARE AT TRYING TO CONTINUE A PROGRAMMER A LEGACY THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE IN TRYING TO PROMOTE WOMEN LEADERSHIP AND I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN THE INTENT OF THESE- OF THESE WOMEN PROMOTING THIS LEGACY OF WOMEN LEADERSHIP TO HAVE BEEN ANY LESS THAN EQUAL OR EMPOWERING FOR WOMEN IT IS DONE HAS BEEN DONE AND GOOD WILL AND GOOD FAITH AND- AND AS- I HAVEN'T BEEN A PARENT WHO ATTENDED- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE LUNCHEONS- HONORING THE YOUNG GIRLS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE WOMEN WERE ADAM ON RESPECTFUL AND HAD EVERY INTENT OF EMPOWERING AT WIDE ARRAY OF DIVERSE WOMEN- FROM AT DIFFERENT ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS TO- ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AND IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE TO HAVE SEEN THESE YOUNG WOMEN- THAT WERE ATTENDING AS WELL AS MEETING THE WOMEN WHO ARE TRYING DESPERATELY TO KEEP A LIFE A PROGRAM OF CIVIC SERVICE. AND AND- ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS SO I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT THIS WOULD IMPOSE- EXTRA BURDENS ON ADMINISTRATIVELY FOR OUR GIRLS NOT THAT IT DOESN'T MERIT D. THE INTENT OF HAVE BEEN WANTING TO WORK TOWARDS THAT AIM AND GOAL BUT I THINK- IT WITH EVERY ORGANIZATION ESPECIALLY A SERVICE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION- PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE MEANS THAT THEY HAVE IN THE CAPACITY OF THEIR OF THE MEMBERSHIP WHICH IS VERY VERY HARD TO COME BY I THINK WE'VE ALL NOTE NOTED. THE THE STATISTICS IN THE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT SERVICE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY OLDER ONES ARE BASICALLY DYING AND THEY ARE VERY MUCH A PART IN IN ESSENCE AND AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OUR OUR OUR COMMUNITIES OFFICIALLY IN MIND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A VERY VERY. STRONG SERVICE VOLUNTEER. IN OUR CITY. AND I RESPECT THEM I COMMEND THEM AND USUALLY MADE UP OF OLDER. OLDER GENERATE OLDER GENERATIONS- BUT WITH THAT- I AM EXCITED THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO BRING THAT EQUITY BUT I AT THIS TIME I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE IT IS A PRIVATE. VOLUNTEER PRIMARILY VOLUNTEER SERVICE ORGANIZATION WHO'S TRYING TO DO THEIR VERY BEST WITHIN THE CAPACITY OF- THEIR VOLUNTEER- ORGANIZATION AND I THINK THEY'RE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN CENTER MCGUIRE WITH REGARDS TO- THERE THE NEED TO HAVE THIS BILL IN PLACE IN ORDER TO BRING THAT PARITY I THINK- THE- DOCTOR. MCKINNEY DID MENTION THE FACT THAT THEY HAD ALREADY IN PLACE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAD BEEN BRINGING FORTH. IN ORDER TO BRING MORE PARITY INTO THE PROGRAM- PRIOR TO SAID THIS IS JUST ANOTHER COMPONENT THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON- BUTTHEY HAVE HAD THE INTENT OF DOING THAT IN PROCESS NUMBER TEN AND LASTLY- I DO WANT IT THANK AND RECOGNIZE SHALL BE AND DON'T- THE ALUMNI FROM FOR ALL STATE OF BRINGING FORTH. THIS THIS IDEA- ORDERS TO LIGHT TO SENATOR CONNIE LEYVA BECAUSE IT DOES SHOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE INTENT OF EMPOWERING GIRLS AND THEIR VOICE AND MOVING FORWARD- WITH CHANGES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO I COMMEND YOU- MR ANGLE FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR ABILITY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD HAVING. A STRONG VOICE AS A WOMAN SO THANK YOU. AND IF ANY AT ALL COMMENTS US CONNIE LEYVA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM VICE CHAIR- TO. ORGANIZATIONS I GUESS MY COMMENT WOULD BE THAT BOYS STATE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FINDING AN ORGANIZATION TO COVER THEIR FEES AND BOISE STATE AND OF THE AMERICAN LEGION OPERATES A VOLUNTEERS AS WELL SO WE'VE GOT ONE VOLUNTEER PROGRAM WHO HAVE TO PAY FEES WITH ANOTHER VOLUNTEER PROGRAM WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FEES AND LOOK FOR SOMEONE TO COVER THOSE FEES SO THAT IN ITSELF IS A HUGE IN EQUITY. AND YOUR COMMENT ABOUT OLDER WISER WOMEN I WOULD SAY THAT AS A FIFTY FOUR YEAR OLD WOMAN I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE OLDER AND WISER AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I IMPART MY WISDOM ON YOUNG WOMEN AND ONE OF THE REASONS I RAN FOR OFFICE WAS SO THAT WE CAN CREATE EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I SEE THIS AS A WAY FOR OLDER WISER WOMEN TO DO THEIR PART IN HELPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WOMEN BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF THIS GOVERNMENT WE KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ONLY HOUSE HOUSE THIRTY EIGHT WOMEN THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS WOMEN SHOULD AT LEAST BE SIXTY OR SIXTY WHICH AT LEAST HAVE SIXTY WOMEN IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. THROUGH GIRL STATE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG WOMEN SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LEGISLATE SO THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN CAN RUN FOR OFFICE AND THEY CAN HELP LEGISLATE AND MOVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL AND I WILL SAY AGAIN I HAVE BEEN SHOCKED BY THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BUT AGAIN IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IT JUST REMINDS US THAT WE ARE A VERY SEXIST SOCIETY SO I ASK MEMBERS FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY WE ALWAYS WORK WITH OPPOSITION ON TEAM LEYVA.

HOW WELL IT WORKED AND WHAT WORKED WHAT DIDN'T WORK- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT- THE BILL TALKS ABOUT- SPECIFIC- SAMPLE HIRING AND FUNDING ONE DISTINGUISHED EDUCATOR EXPERIENCE IMPROVING PUPIL PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES WHICH I THINK ON SURFACE SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA BUT I'M BUT I AM INTERESTED IN- HEARING AND I DID HEAR THE- THE PROPONENTS TESTIMONY IN TERMS OF THE EVIDENCE BASE BEHIND THAT I MEAN I THINK. BRING AN EMINENT EDUCATORS CAN BE USEFUL IF THE CULTURE AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS ONE THAT WOULD YOU KNOW WANT TO.

AND SO SHE INTO OF- WE SHOULD WE FOR THE TO- OF THE PART ONE BECAUSE ARE TWO DO STRESS. AND WE SELL IT STILL IN IF YOU'RE AT THE KNOW THE. TEN THERE IS NOT OF THOSE STRAIGHT. THAT WILL. FIX ALL OF IT AND SO I THINK THERE HAS TO BE MULTIPLE WAYS TO LOOK AT I MEAN. ONE WAY TO BE. ONE THE IN ONE OF THESE TEN YOU KNOW MEANS THAT YOU. AMONG THE LOWER PERFORM INSTANCE THAT'S- THAT IN REQUIRES A D. TYPE OF INVESTMENT WHICH IS WHY BELIEVE SHOULDN'T. WAIT I WANT BECAUSE ARE YOU ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO THAT WERE GOING TO HAVE TO INVEST IN DIFFERENT WAYS- YOU ARE IN THE YOU KNOW. A ONE OF THESE TEN US.

I WANT TO FIRST THANK THAT CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE TO SUPPORT OUR STATE STUDENTS. AS AT THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXPOSED AND ENTRENCHED EDUCATIONAL INEQUITIES WHICH ARE MOST PRONOUNCED AMONG STUDENTS FROM LAURIE COULD EAT INCOME FAMILIES. STUDENTS IN RURAL ENVIRONMENTS AND STUDENTS WHO ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOSTER YOUTH. OR WHO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WE SEE THAT FOR MENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PAST YEAR MANIFESTED IN INCREASED ABSENTEEISM. STUDENTS RECEIVING WORSE GRADES AND STUDENTS IN CRUCIAL DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS DEMONSTRATING LOWER LITERACY LEVELS. AS AMENDED THIS BILL ADDRESSES THESE HARMS BY MANDATING THAT UPON RECEIVING A REQUEST FOR PEOPLE TO BE RETAINED A SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFER. PEOPLE SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORT PURSUANT TO AB EIGHTY SIX BOXES TO PRIOR SEMESTER COURSES IN WHICH THE STUDENT RECEIVED A D. OR F. GRADE OR SOME OTHER FORMER CREDIT RECOVERY.

MY NAME IS DR MEDINA AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES IN PLANNING FOR THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC GOING TO COLLEGE DISTRICT. SB SIX OF THE NINE MAKES TOO SMALL BUT CRITICAL CHANGES THAT WOULD ALLOW ME BECAUSE DISTRICTS USE LOCAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE PART OF THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF STUDENTS TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE INCLUDING BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS FOOD HOUSING. TRANSPORTATION AND FAMILY CARE. ASSEMBLY THIS BILL WILL LOCAL BOARDS. TO ADOPT. THAT REDUCE OR ELIMINATE ENROLLMENT FEES FOR STUDENTS BASED ON CRITERIA SUCH DOCUMENTED FINANCIAL BATES. ISRAEL ALSO ALLOWS LOCAL BOARDS OF TRUSTEES TO DEDICATE LOCAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE TENDONS IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT CAN BE SERVED IN COLLEGE PROBLEMS PROGRAMS. BOTH OF THESE CHANGES WILL ALLOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO BUILD ON EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT WHICH IS FORMERLY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS ARE BOND TREE WAIVER AND AB NINETEEN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROBLEMS. YOU MIGHT REASONABLY ASK WHAT MIGHT BE CHANGES LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE. THE BILL STATE SMOKABLE OR THE TRUSTEES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT LOCAL POLICIES THESE COULD FOR EXAMPLE EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT PROGRAMS TO SERVE STUDENTS WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY QUALIFY. BUT NONE THE LESS HAVE FINANCIAL NEED BECAUSE OF THE AREA IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY LIVE. HERE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE MEDIAN HOME PRICE IS MORE THAN ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WHAT WE AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT BENEFIT FROM THOSE LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES THE COST OF LIVING CREATES A TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL BARRIER TO THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE.

PREVIOUS STATE FEDERAL LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING STATE REGIONAL LOCAL PROGRAMS WITH SUFFICIENT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS DID DO A LOT TO HELP THIS ISSUE OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. HOWEVER STATE SUPPORT ENDED WHEN FUNDING WAS CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. WITHOUT ACCORDING TO STATE AND REGIONAL FOCUS ON POLICY PROGRAMS AND FUNDING MANY DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO SELECT ACCESS TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY PROTECTIVELY.

WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX SB FIVE NINETY THREE SENATOR GLAZERS. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MATTER CHAIR NOW. SEPARATE SHADES OP. PER TO ADD FIVE NINETY THREE AND ONE OF THAT EXCELLENT. STAFF FOR THEIR WORK WITH MY OFFICE IN CRAFTING AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL. BETTER SB FIVE NINETY THREE WOULD IMPROVE INDEPENDENT AUDITS. OF THE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS SOMETIMES CALLED INDEPENDENT STUDY. TO GIVE US A BETTER CHANCE OF CATS CATCHING FRAUD. BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL. THIS BILL IS BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WHICH UNCOVERED AND PROSECUTED MAJOR SCHOOL FRAUD CASE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. NINE CLASSROOM BASED SCHOOLS ARE DEFINED AS SCHOOLS WERE MORE THAN 20% OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. AND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM. THE SCHOOLS CAN BE A HUGE HELP TO STUDENTS WHO CANNOT ATTEND IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION OR WHOSE FAMILIES FIND AT THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY IS A BETTER OPTION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. MANY OF THE STUDENTS COME FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. INDEPENDENT STUDY IS OFTEN THEIR LAST CHANCE TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE LONG EXCELLED IN THE SPACE BECAUSE OF THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION. DURING THE PANDEMIC THE SPECIALIZED NICHE. SERVE THE STATE WELL AS PARENTS WERE LOOKING FOR OPTIONS IN THE FACE OF WIDESPREAD SCHOOL CLOSURES. BUT THE SAME TRAITS THAT MAY MAKE NINE CLASSROOM BASED SCHOOLS VALUABLE. ALSO LEADS THE MODEL VULNERABLE TO ABUSE. ENROLLMENT EXPENSES ANY ACADEMIC PROGRAM ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK IN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T OPERATE OUT OF A SINGLE PHYSICAL SPACE. THAT HAS ALLOWED A HANDFUL OF SHADY OPERATORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TE MODEL FOR PERSONAL GAINS. THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF THESE CASES WAS THE A. THREE SCHOOL NETWORK BASED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THAT'S COOL. THAT'S COOL OPERATORS STILL MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION. IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE SCHOOL DID THIS BY CREATING FAKE ENROLLMENT RECORDS AND THEN COLLECTING REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE STATE FOR NON EXISTENT STUDENTS. EIGHT THREE FUNNEL THAT MONEY INTO SHELL COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY THE SCHOOL'S OPERATORS. THE AUDITORS ARE SUPPOSED TO SURVEY A RANDOM SAMPLE OF INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS EVERY YEAR TO VERIFY ENROLLMENT. BUT THE AUDITORS WHO REVIEWED EIGHTY THREES RECORDS. MISTER AND MISS THIS FRAUD TESTIFIED TO THE GRAND JURY THAT THE SCHOOL MANAGERS HAD SELECTED THE STUDENTS THAT HE VERIFIED STEERING HIM AWAY FROM THE PHONY ENROLLMENT. SB FIVE NINETY THREE WOULD REQUIRE AUDITORS TO PICK THOSE RANDOM SAMPLES THEMSELVES FREE OF ANY DIRECTION FROM THE SCHOOL. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE AUDITORS TO FLAG ANY TRANSACTIONS GREATER THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS 410% OF THE SCHOOLS BUDGET AND THE TEST A RANDOM SAMPLE OF TRANSACTIONS AGAINST A QUOTE MATERIALITY STANDARD UNQUOTE. TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY IS SPENT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES. FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ANY INDEPENDENT AUDITOR REVIEWING A NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL TO COMPLETE A TRAINING COURSE OFFERED BY THE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANT TEAM KNOWN AS FICK MAD. NO SAFEGUARD CAN NEVER STOP EVERY CRIMINAL TO DETERMINE TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM AND TO STEAL PUBLIC FUNDS. AND WHILE THE EXAMPLE I GAVE TODAY INVOLVED A CHARTER SCHOOL. STILL SCHOOLS ALSO VICTIMS FINANCIAL FRAUD. BUT WE CAN DO MORE TO TRY TO PREVENT THESE CRIMES AND WE CAN DO IT IN A STRATEGIC WAY. THAT DOES NOT PUNISH THE MANY ETHICAL PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL MANAGERS AND TEACHERS WHO ARE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AT HEART SB FIVE NINETY THREE DOES JUST THAT IRESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY- ARE CARLOS MARQUEZ REPRESENTATION IN EDUCATION AND JEFF RICE SPEAKING FOR THE A PLUS PERSONALIZED LEARNING NETWORK ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GLAZERS MISTER MARQUEZ AND MR RIGHT BOTH HAVE TO MANAGE MINUTES EACH PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CARLOS MARQUEZ ABOUT PROVISIONS IN EDUCATION IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE NINETY THREE AND FIRST THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS FOR YOUR DEALERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. ISN'T AN EDUCATION IS THAT NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL SERVING SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO REGION AND BAY AREA. YOU'RE A COMBINATION OF INDEPENDENT THAT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS AND HOME SCHOOL PROGRAMS. BEIJING HAS BEEN OPERATING WITH TRANSPARENCY INTEGRITY FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND WE DO THE INDEPENDENT AUDIT AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN SB FIVE NINE THREE AT THEM THE BALL AND EFFECTIVE DETERRENT. TO THE FRAUD PERPETRATED IN CANYON COUNTY BY LEADERS OF THE H. THREE CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK. SB FIVE NINETY THREE WOULD CODIFY NEARLY ALL OF SAN DIEGO DA'S INDEPENDENT AUDIT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND FURTHER PROPOSES INDEPENDENT AUDIT ENHANCEMENTS BEYOND THOSE RECOMMENDED BY ANTIOQUIA ACT. AS WE LEARN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THICK MAT REQUIRING AN AUTOMATIC FRAUD ON IT AT EVERY NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL. AS ADVOCATED BY THE OPPOSITION IS IMPRACTICABLE ON THE BASIS THAT OF TWO FACTORS. THE LIMITED CAPACITY OF BROADER IS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE EXORBITANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING SUCH PRODUCTS. INSTEAD S. B. FIVE NINETY THREE RETOOL ANNUAL INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL AUDIT IN A MANNER THAT TRIAGE IS SCHOOLS. CLEARED OF ANY IRREGULAR ACTIVITY FROM SCHOOLS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED IRREGULAR ACTIVITY. THEREBY PAVING THE WAY FOR POSSIBLE FRAUD AUDIT OF THOSE IDENTIFIED SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A REGULAR ACTIVITY. MASON BELIEVES THAT THE REFORMS CONTAINED IN SB FIVE NINE THREE WILL DRAMATICALLY TO CHARAKTER TRINITY'S FOR SELF DEALING AND FRAUD. WHILE PRESERVING ON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AT THE NETWORK PUBLIC SCHOOL OPTION FOR STUDENTS REQUIRE NONTRADITIONAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE- I ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER MARQUEZ MISTER RICE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS RIGHT FOUNDER DIRECTOR THE A PLUS PERSONALLY LEARNING THAT IS SO. WHICH IS A STATE MEMBERS THIS. COMPRISED OF EIGHTY FIVE PERSONALIZED LEARNING PUBLIC. CHARTER SCHOOL MEMBERS SERVING MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE STUDENTS.

AND ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE WE SUPPORT SB FIVE NINETY THREE BOTH AS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT STEP IN CLOSING PASSED KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND POTENTIAL LOOPHOLES IN ANNUAL AUDIT REVIEWS. OF THE ROCK VARIETY OF MODELS AND PRACTICES WITHIN THE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL SEGMENT. AND IS A STRONG MEASURE TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT TRAINING AND PREPARATION. IN THE UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL REQUIREMENTS FOR AUDITORS OF NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE FUTURE. FOR YEARS THE NON CLASSROOM BASED STATUTORY CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN AN UNFORTUNATE MISNOMER THAT HAS LED TO SERIOUS CONFUSION MISUNDERSTANDING AND MISINFORMATION. ABOUT THE VARIETY OF VERY INNOVATIVE EDUCATION DELIVERY MILES WITHIN THE SEGMENT. MANY OF WHICH INCLUDE PERSONALIZED BLENDED AND HYBRID LEARNING MODELS FOR STUDENTS AS WELL AS- NUMEROUS OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING AT SCHOOL SITE FACILITIES. FOR UP 280% OF EACH STUDENT'S INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. THE REPORT RELEASED THIS WEEK BY THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION PROVIDES THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE THOROUGH AND ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THE VARIOUS MODELS AND PRACTICES WITHIN THE NON CLASSROOMS A SEGMENT WRITTEN. AS THESE PROGRAMS HAVE EVOLVED AND ADAPTED THROUGH THE YEARS TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND INDEPENDENT ANNUAL REVIEW OF THESE UNIQUE EDUCATION MODELS IN OPERATIONS REQUIRES SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE IN ORDER FOR AN OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL TO IDENTIFY BOTH GOOD PRACTICES AND POTENTIALLY QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES. PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT IS SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE VIOLATIONS OF THE PUBLIC TRUST UP TO BAD ACTOR. ORGANIZATIONS IN THE FLAG AND PLUS RECOGNIZE THE ACTUAL WORK BEING BY THESE GOOD QUALITY PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS AND DO NO HARM TO THEM WHEN SEEKING TO REMEDY POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES IN LAW THAT MAY HAVE LED TO ABUSES. SB FIVE NINETY THREE IS A SOUND PROPOSAL IN ACHIEVING THIS IMPORTANT GOAL IS BASED ON THE SAN DIEGO DA'S. INDEPENDENT AUDIT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND WILL PROVIDE STRONGER AND BETTER TRAINED INDEPENDENT EYES IN REVIEWING NON CLASSROOM BASED OPERATIONS AND PRACTICES ANNUALLY. THANK YOU TO SENATOR GLAZER FOR OFFERING SB FIVE NINETY THREE AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE NINETY THREE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AS WELL.

THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS ALEX KAPLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION. WHILE WE HAVE NO POSITIONS CURRENTLY ON THE BILL WE ARE KEY STAKEHOLDER AS WE REPRESENT NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AS PART OF OUR MEMBERSHIP. AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR SPONSORING COMMITTEES WORK ON THAT I THINK THESE ARE SENSIBLE POLICY REFORMS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING- ON THIS MOVING FORWARD I'M AT A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT NON CLASSROOM DAY. CHARTER SCHOOL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AGAIN PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. I'M SURE NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW GO TO LEAD OPPOSITION I HAVE SAID BRAMBLE THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND GERMANY'S ANNIKA A TWELFTH GRADE TEACHER AT OSCAR DE LA HOYA. ME AN EMAIL CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL A GENTLEMAN YOU BOTH HAVE A LITTLE OVER TWO MINUTES AS SUPPORT WENT OVER AND THEIR TIME PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BRAMBELL SPEAKING FOR CTA RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY THREE AS IT WAS AMENDED LAST WEEK. WE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED A MORATORIUM ON NEW NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WORKS ON THAT THIS YEAR AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL. WILL OPEN TH FLOODGATES TO CONTINUE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN WITHOUT FIXING THEM. AND I WANT TO LIFT UP TO PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT IN YOUR ANALYSIS FIRST. MANY FAMILIES HAVE CHOSEN TO PULL THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN INSTEAD AND ROLLING IN THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN USED AS A WAY TO SUPPLEMENT VACATION EXPENSES. WITH FAMILY SPENDING AS MUCH AS THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ANNUALLY SOMETHING LIKE MULTI DAY FAMILY PASSES TO DISNEYLAND. HOMESCHOOL BLOGGERS ARE RIGHT ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA PARENTS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SCHEME OF THIS KIND OF ARRANGEMENT IS NOT HAPPENING IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY THREE WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS KIND OF ABUSE TO CONTINUE TO GROW SECONDLY. NOT QUESTION BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE DEFINED IN CALIFORNIA LAW PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT MOST ARE NOT-PROVIDING ADEQUATE ACCESS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS A CO KIND OF EXPLICITLY PROVIDES. THAT STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS MAY ONLY BE EDUCATED THROUGH INDEPENDENT STUDY. STUDENTS IEPS SPECIFICALLY CALLS FOR AND AS A RESULT OF LIMITING THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TO NON CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION THE SCHOOLS CAN EXCLUDE STUDENTS WHO NEED SPECIAL EDUCATION. A CONTROLS IN PLACE WITH THE MATARA MORATORIUM NOW PREVENT AN OUTBURST OF NEW PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE TO SERVE ALL STUDENTS. BUT SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY THREE DOES NOTHING TO FIX THIS LAW. THE BILL ANALYSIS DOES A GOOD JOB IN HIGHLIGHTING HOW MANY OF THESE SCHOOLS TARGET HIGH NEED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND AUTHORIZERS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CAPACITY TO DO OVERSIGHT IT POINTS OUT THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE COLLECTING THEIR OWN AUDITORS AND FIRING THEM IF THEY DON'T HEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. IT HIGHLIGHTS THOSE DOING THE OVERSIGHT DO NOT HAVE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT DATA FOR THOSE ENROLLED. AND ONE IS NOT A PHYSICAL CLASSROOM. WHERE YOU CAN SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES. BUT THEIR TEACHER AND LEARNING. PLACE MISTER IS THE LIKELY OUTCOME. THE OTHER MAJOR CONCERNS WITH NON. BASED CHARTERS LAW AND WE'RE NOT. OF A HANDFUL OF SHE OPERATE HERE SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY THREE DOES PROVIDE SOLUTION AND WE WOULD ALLOW. BASICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THESE PROBLEMS TO CONTINUE WE'RE URGING A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR BRAMBLE PHARMACIES IN AGO PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE- LIKE I MENTIONED THE ONE BENCH MANAGER MEETING I TEACH WILL CREATE GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMIC ALTERNATELY A AND MUCH OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IN LA WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREEN DOT PUBLIC SCHOOLS I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PARAMETERS THAT AND THEY URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB FIVE NINETY THREE. I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RECENTLY READING THE L. A. TIMES ABOUT WHAT OCCURRED EIGHT THREE EDUCATION LIKE GREEN DOT EIGHT THREE OPERATED NINETEEN CHARTER SCHOOL BUT THE ANIMAL STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOL BUT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY DOING SCHOOL WORK FROM WHAT I READ IN MOMENT WORKERS WHAT APPROACH THE SUMMER ATHLETICS PROGRAMS. NUMBER TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A HEAD FOR EACH AFTER EACH PLAYER'S RECORD IN ROMAN WORKER WOULD GET A COMMISSION ON HOWEVER MANY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE ADULTS WHO ARE RUNNING THE SCHOOL FIGURE OUT WAYS TO GET MORE MONEY PER CHILD AND MAKE SURE THAT. I AM WILLING STUDENTS AT ONE SCHOOL DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR AT ANOTHER SCHOOL DURING THE SUMMER AS. IT WAS A DIFFERENT SCHOOL YEAR. I OF DOUBLE DIPPING THE- CHARTER. ABOUT NAME. WHEN I READ IT A THREE. AND THE- DEAL TO RETURN THAN TWO. AND MILLION. IN CASH I COULD. HELP THINK OF ALL OF THE- THINGS. MY SCHOOL COULD USE THAT MONEY FOR. LIKE HAVING REASONABLE CLASS SIZES. AND THREE PER TURN TO SCHOOL. HOW THE PLOT HAS ALLOWED NON. BASED COURSE HARDER SCHOOLS PRETTY FUNDING. FOR SCHOOL BY MINE. IS WHY I THINK WE NEED TO THE MORE. ON NON BASED ON. BASED CHARTER SCHOOL THAT WE CAN REALLY FIX CLOCK HELLO SILVA. WHEN IT COMES TO NON. BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND OF COURSE. OF THE TOPICS NEW POP WE NEED TO CONNECTICUT RECALLS TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THIS. DOING. THE REAL. THE CLUB PARLANCE MONEY. RIGHT INSTRUCTIONS SCHOOLS ARE NOT PICKING PLACE LET'S GO BUILDING WITH A COMING OUT AGREED OVER THE YEAR. H. THE ANY INDICATE FROM CLASS OUR SCHOOLS MAY EVEN NOT MAY NOT EVEN NEED MONEY FOR. NOT HARD TO HOLD THE SAME I AM PROUD TO BE A CHARGE SCHOOL AS YOU FOR THE THIRTY YEARS BY THE- A LOT ALLOWED THE KIND OF THE TO OCCUR. WE BUT WE NEED BE ABLE TO WEED OUT THOSE THAT ARE EDUCATION FOR THE WRONG REASONS AND THEN BILL OPENED UP THE DOORS FOR THE BAD ACTOR TO WASH HIS HANDS OF THE SCANDAL HE KEEPS STEALING MONEY THAT SHOULD BE GOING TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES LIKE. MINE I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW TO ALL. TO HEAR AN FORTY TWO OH THREE. SEEING NONE WILL GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY. SEEING NONE. MISTER MODERATOR GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO YOU DO WE HAVE ANYONE QUEUING UP THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SB FIVE NINETY THREE. THANK YOU. TO SHOW YOUR OPPOSITION SB FIVE NINETY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHOW OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE NINETY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. I'M SURE NOBODY IS QUEUING UP. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CONCERNS SENATOR CORTESE. THE THIRTY MINIATURE JUST EARNED- IF IT'S ME TO PROVE THE CHAIR I JUST WANTED THEM TO ASKS A WE HAVE OF THE AUTHOR A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- NOT NECESSARILY- DETAILS BROUGHT A BODY. BECAUSE SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION- WITNESSES AT THIS POINT. ONE OF THINGS THAT CONCERN ME IN READING THROUGH IT WAS WOULD SEEM TO BE A RELATIVELY QUICK TURNAROUND ON THE TRAINING THAT YOU'RE CALLING FOR HIM TO JUST SAY- LET ME PAUSE FOR A MINUTE AND JUST SAY I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BILL IS A ATTEMPTING TO SORT OF BE FOR A POOR- CREATE ALREADY- STANDARDS. IN HAND AND TRAINING AND- PRACTICES STOOD OR APPROPRIATE- THAT'S A GOOD THING- REGARDLESS OF. ONE'S FEELINGS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT- THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF NON CLASSROOM BASED EDUCATION- SHOULD CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE AS IT CONTINUES IT SHOULD BE AUDITED THAT'S MY FUNDAMENTAL FEELING. BUT WHAT I BACK TO MY INITIAL CONCERN AS YOU- HE THE WAY I READ THE BILL NOT BEEN PERHAPS IT'S BEEN AMENDED BUT- HE- IS THERE'S MANDATORY TRAINING- BUT ANYONE WHO HASN'T TAKEN ON THE MANDATORY TRAINING BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER- IS NOT QUALIFIED TO AUDIT I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE IDEA THERE IS SAID YOU WANT PEOPLE TO HURRY UP AND GET TRAINED SO THAT THEY CAN. QUALIFIED AUDIT BUT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A FEE TO GET THE TRAINING WHICH I HAVE NO IDEA READING THE BILL HOW MUCH OF A BERRY OR NOT THAT MAY BE- AND THEN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE AN AWFULLY QUICK TURNAROUND IN NOT KNOWING HOW MANY PEOPLE GOING TO QUALIFY- HERE TO SORT OF. LACK BETTER WORKFORCE THE NEW ORLEANS STANDARDS- THE NEW TRAINING STANDARDS ON ON EVERYBODY SO. I'M IMAGINING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION THERE IN TERMS TRYING TO HURRY UP- IN GET THE óRDENES THE UC AUTHOR SEE THE KIND OF TRAINING YOU SEE IS APPROPRIATE IN PLACE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M WORRIED ABOUT- THE LACK OF ENROLLMENT IN THE TRAINING LEADING TO. HERNE HILL PERHAPS AN EQUAL OR GREATER PROBLEM- THAT WE JUST HAVE DISQUALIFIED AUDITORS NOW WE CAN FIND OF AUDITORS TO COME IN AND DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE PERHAPS AND PUTTING THAT OUT THERE FOR YOUR RESPONSE THANK YOU SENATOR AND I THINK OUR OUR INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT. WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONCERNS FOR THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY ABOUT THE TIME LINES THAT HAVE BEEN SAID IN THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT THE TRAINING IS DONE I'M CERTAINLY- WOULD BE OPEN TO ANY CONCERNS THAT ARE OUT THERE ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS CORRECTLY THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT I THINK WHAT YOU WANT AS WELL. SO I'M JUST NOT AWARE OF ANY AT THE MOMENT- THAT WOULD BE WOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH ME BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR CERTAINLY COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS WELL. OKAY WHAT IT HE IS IN. IN THE- A- AT THIS AT THIS STAGE I DO BELIEVE THE BILL NEEDS. SOME WORK ON THE CLIENT TO SUPPORTED TODAY FOR NO OTHER REASON AS A COURTESY TO. A COLLEAGUE TO GET THIS BILL OUT FOR CONTINUED WORK- IN. YOU KNOW THAT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY TO THE VOTE TODAY BUT- THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE GOING INTO A SEVENTY THE FIRST ONE SPEAKING TODAY- I'M- HERE ON THE DATE ON THE DAIS- THE OTHER. THE OTHER. CONCERNED I HAD WHICH IS REALLY ZOOMING OUT A LITTLE BIT IF IT DOES GO TO. THE NATURE OF. WHAT SOME OF THE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERED OR- ENGAGED IN NOT ALL BUT SOME- IS THAT THE- LABEL SEEMS TO COVER A WHOLE LOT OF GROUND AND INCLUDING YOU KNOW FOLKS WHO ARE DOING- HERO WHAT I WOULD CALL VOTE. CONSERVATION WORK FEEL WORK IN ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL BUT THE NON THE VIRTUAL NON CLASSROOM DAYS. AREA WHICH I THINK YOU'RE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON BASED ON THE DEIFICATION THAT THAT OCCURRED WITH SOME OF THE SCHOOLS. IT HE HE WE'RE HEARING AS A LEGISLATURE. IN OF COURSE WEEK WE PASS LEGISLATION AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF US DID. TO TRY TO GET KIDS BACK INTO CLASSROOMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE SENSE THAT. WHAT WE PART OF WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC IS THAT. HE HE THE CUSTOMER DUCATION IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN A TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE STUDENT- THAT. THE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE SEEN BILLS COME THROUGH IN OFFICE AS RECENTLY AS TODAY DEALING WITH SLIPPAGE DEALING WITH CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE CLASSROOM WE DON'T HAVE THIS THE TEACHERS AT SOME POINT STANDING IN FRONT OF THE STUDENTS. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO IT NECESSARILY TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUE I THINK CTA BROUGHT UP- OR THE UP SOMEBODY ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE BROUGHT UP ABOUT. THE CONTINUING MORATORIUM OR NOT ON ON THIS TYPE OF. THE VIRTUAL EDUCATION- BUT I LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR SENTIMENT ABOUT THAT IS GOING FOR IRAQ IN JUST IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF NOT WANTING TO BE AT CROSS PURPOSES- TRYING TO TRYING TO BE AS UNIFORM AS POSSIBLE. WITH OUR COLLECTIVE PHILOSOPHY GOING FORWARD AS TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF. THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM- ARE WE REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING EVERY CHILD BACK IN INTO A CLASSROOM- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A CHOICE HERE BUT ARE WE FOCUSED ON OUR RESOURCES TRYING TO GET KIDS BACK INTO CLASSROOMS- OR IS THIS AN AREA THAT. YOU BELIEVE SHOULD HAVE SOME GROWTH GOING FORWARD. THROUGH THE CHAIR ON WHEELS CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SPIRITED DEBATES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS IS THIS AREA AND- I THINK THAT YOU WILL- WELCOME IN HERE THAT MANY- DELIBERATIONS ON LEGISLATION IN THE SPACE NOT JUST IN THIS NARROW CATEGORY OF NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER COMPANY THE BROADER QUESTION INCLUDING THE MORATORIUM- INCLUDING- A VARIETY OF OTHER STANDARDS THAT ARE APPLIED OR DON'T APPLY SO. IT IS A ROBUST DEBATE THAT WE DO HAVE IN THE SPACE KEEP IN MIND THAT- NOT CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS THAT WOULD ONLY YOU EAT YOU FIT THAT CATEGORY THE 220% ARE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM NOT NOT WHAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING- HERE IN THE PANDEMIC IN MOST CASES SO IT'S A IT'S A NARROWER FRAME AND EVEN MORE SO IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S DEFINED. SO LOOK AT IT THIS THAT IT I THINK YOUR QUESTION DOES MOVE INTO THIS BROADER SPACE OF A PUBLIC CHARTERS AND DAY AND THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY AND THE CHOICES THAT THEY PROVIDE- OR SHOULD SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT PROVIDE. TO THE PARENT COMMUNITY- IT. I TRYING TO STAY PUT ON THIS NARROWS- THE I THINK THAT WE WILL AT AT MY GUESS IS THIS COMMITTEE WILL HEAR BILLS THAT WOULD GO FURTHER THAN. WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU WHEN OTHER THINGS THAT SHOULD BE DONE THAT MANY PEOPLE SHOULD BE DONE AND OTHER PEOPLE THINK. ART SHOULD NOT BE DONE I THINK YU YOU WILL SEE. IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION SOME ADDITIONAL- ABOUT BILLS IN POINTS OF DEBATE IN THE SPACE BUT FOR ME AT LEAST CENTER WITH RESPECT. I'M TRYING TO STAY THERE- WE'VE HAD THESE TERRIBLE ABUSES AND MAKES ALL OF US UPSET AND ANGRY. AND OUT TRY TO BE VERY RESPONSIVE TO WHAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS SAID OUR REFORMS THAT WOULD TRY TO PREVENT THIS IS NOT AND MATTER. OF MAKE IT ANY EASIER WE ACTUALLY WANT TO TRY TO STOP IT THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE EXACT ABUSES THAT OCCURRED IN THIS CASE. HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS IN RESPONSE I KNOW IT'S NOT. THE BROADER QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE REYES BUT IT AT LEAST CLOSE TO MY FOCUS IN THIS BILL. THE NEW IT JUST ONE MORE A QUICK COMMENT AND ONE MORE QUESTION- MADAM CHAIR AND THEN ALL. OF THEM. WE'LL SEE THE FOR- A AND I JUST I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHERE I'M COMING FROM HIS. OF A LONG WAY BACK AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. HIMSELF IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. WHEN CHARTERED WHEN THE CHARTER LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED ORIGINALLY. IN. IT THE LEGISLATION WAS. WAS OSTENSIBLY WITH THE INTENT TO INFORM PRODUCTIVE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND SO ANYTIME I LOOK AT WHAT HE THE CHARTER IS DOING TO THIS DAY ALL THESE YEARS LATER I ASK MYSELF THE QUESTION ARE THEY DOING SOMETHING THAT INFORMS PRODUCTIVE CHANGE IN OUR OVERALL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN SO THAT'S WHY RAISE THE BROADER ISSUE BECAUSE- AUDIT. WELL THEY'RE IN BUSINESS GREAT BUT I JUST WANT US I JUST WANTED TO PUT ON THE RECORD I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THE MODEL. ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT WE LEARNED OF THE PANDEMIC IS ACTUALLY INFORMING- THE KIND OF PRODUCTIVE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT. THE CHARTERS WERE INTENDED TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT DISAGREE OR AGREE ON THAT AND THEN THAT'LL PROBABLY UNTIL ITSELF LATER- LAST QUESTION- THE WITH THE- BUS WHICH REPORTER WHO WITH- BUT MY LAST QUESTION WITH WITH REGARD TO- THE. THE ISSUE OF BUT I'M I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PASS I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT THE CENTER MANAGER AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT AND THERE WAS ONE MORE PARTICULAR VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH THE BILL IS CONCERNED ABOUT AND PERHAPS IF I CAN RESERVE THE RIGHT TO COME BACK ON THAT THE- THERE'S TIME LATER I WILL THANK YOU NO PROBLEM CENTER COURSE ATV I DON'T THINK THE CENTER GLAZERS GOING ANYWHERE- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU AND- IN THE CIRCULATOR- APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED BUT I GUESS. MY POINT IS THIS IS A PRETTY NARROW BILL THIS IS DEALING WITH THE AUDITING AND- I THINK IT'S THAT THAT'S ALSO NOTED IN ALICE'S- AND- WELL MAYBE A MORE RIGOROUS AUDIT SYSTEM MAY. HAVE PICKED UP THIS FRAUD EARLIER- I DO FEEL THERE ARE OTHER RECOMMEND- ISSUES THAT. REVEALED IN IN THE CASE AND NOT ONLY THIS CASE BUT OTHERS IN TERMS OF STUDENT DATA TRACKING OR DID YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THESE LITTLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE DOING THE AUTHORIZATION. ZERO TEN ONLY TO FOCUS ON AUDITING OUR WAS AND THAT THAT'S WHAT'S-CURRENTLY IN THE BILL- DID DID THIS THIS IS THE ISSUES AROUND THE DATA TRACKING AND- THE CAPACITY OF THE AUTHORIZER TO ACTUALLY ASIDE FROM AUDITING MONITORED THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE- A CHURCH SCHOOLS IS THAT SOMETHING YOU VIEWS OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF WHAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO. THE COMPLETION OF THIS BILL AND LEAVE IT TO OTHERS- SO JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT A WHAT THE GOALS WERE FOR THE FOR THE FOR THIS BILL IN TERMS OF TRADE DRESS. CERTAINLY THIS THIS PROBLEM. AND THE CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. I THINK THE BILL IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SEE- AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE THAT PROBLEM THAT WE ARE IT WAS IDENTIFIED THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AS TO HOW WE COULD TRY TO PREVENT IT IN THE FUTURE. THAT THERE ARE- CERTAINLY- DEBATABLE ISSUES- ABOUT AUTHORIZES AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT CAN COME INTO PLAY IN A BROADER SENSE OF- OF THE PUBLIC CHARTER- MOVEMENT TO COMMUNITY- BUT IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO- TO. TAKE ON ANYTHING MORE THAN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND THE BILL TODAY I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE OTHER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THIS SESSION THAT ARE GOING TO TOUCH UPON I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RACING AND WILL HAVE A ROBUST DEBATE ON THOSE WITH HEY WHEN THEY COME FORWARD OKAY I APPRECIATE. THAT EXPLANATION- I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL STAKES I THINK IT MOVES THINGS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I DO FEEL THAT-THIS BILL IS. A LITTLE BIT TOO LIMITED AND ITS APPROACH BUT OF COURSE- I KEEP MOVING THE RIGHT DIRECTION- I THINK AS WE SEE OTHER LEGISLATION I HOPE THAT THIS IS IN LINE WITH THAT BUT I CERTAINLY I WOULD NOT SEE THIS BILL AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR BROAD REFORMS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND DE DUM. AMONG NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT- BUT I WILL- MOVED TO SPILL AT APPROPRIATE TIME SO WE CAN MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER PAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SIEMENS AND REPLACE WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE- FOR HEARING THE BILL. RECOGNIZING THAT THE PROBLEM THAT I THINK WE ALL ARE QUITE ANGRY ABOUT- AS EXPLAINED EARLIER- AND I THINK THIS BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU IS VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE SPECIFIC- IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THAT OCCURRED IN THIS CASE AND- AND WAYS TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN I THINK IT'S A LIKE A GOOD IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD ALTHOUGH. MANY BE THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL IT SHOULD BE BROADER- IN THE IN SCOPE IN THE IN THE IN THE ORDER OF THINGS BUT I THINK IT- IT PUTS ITS SENSES- IT. BRUISES IN THE CRASH DIRECTION THAT I'VE- ASK FOR KNIVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GLAZERS. I'M A CONSULTANT WE A BY CENTER PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SB SIX NINETY THREE. MEMBERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A STUDY FOUND THAT. MILLENNIALS COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE SIGNIFICANCE ABOUT SHORTS LIKE ABOUT THAT. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THE COLLECTIVE MEMORY OF THE HOLOCAUST. AND THIS SYSTEMATIC EXTERMINATION OF MILLIONS IS UNFORTUNATELY FADING. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS COLLECTIVE MEMORY LOSS ARE STARK AND READILY DEMONSTRATED BY THE RISE IN ANTI SEMITIC SPEECH AND ACTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE FOUND THAT MORE THAN FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ANTI SEMITIC POSTS ON TWITTER IN A RECENT TWELVE MONTH PERIOD FOUR POINT TWO MILLION. THIS WAS A COMPANY BY A 12% RISE IN ANTI SEMITIC ACTS OF ASSAULT VANDALISM AND HARASSMENT THE LARGEST SUCH ANNUAL INCREASE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. SB SIX NINETY THREE WILL ESTABLISH THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL ON GENOCIDE AND HOLOCAUST EDUCATION. TO TRY TO ELEVATE AND TACKLED THIS VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S MODELED- IT'S BOTTLED UP OF SIMILAR LEGISLATION ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND IN STATES SUCH AS PENNSYLVANIA. SB SIX NINETY THREE ESTABLISHES THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL ON GENOCIDE AND HOLOCAUST EDUCATION COMPOSED OF SEVENTEEN EXPERTS ON GENOCIDE EDUCATION INCLUDING THE HOLOCAUST. THE COUNCIL IS TASKED WITH APPROVING AID AGE APPROPRIATE BEST PRACTICES AND RESOURCES FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS REGARDING GENOCIDE EDUCATION INCLUDING THE HOLOCAUST. THE COUNCIL SERVED TO PROMOTE GENOCIDE EDUCATION IT WOULD BE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH INDIVIDUAL WORKING GROUP'S TO PUT TOGETHER BEST PRACTICES FOR TEACHING ABOUT THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. THE GENOCIDE AGAINST THE TUTSI IN RWANDA AND OTHER GENOCIDES COMMITTED IN AFRICA ASIA LATIN AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. THE APPROVED BEST PRACTICES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WEBSITE FOR ALL TEACHERS INTERESTED IN PROVIDING GENOCIDE EDUCATION WITHIN EXISTING CURRICULUM GUIDELINES. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT A CURRICULA MANDATE IT SIMPLY PROVIDES APPROVED BEST PRACTICES FOR TEACHERS WITH AN EXISTING GUIDELINES. GENOCIDE IS A CHALLENGING SUBJECT TO TACKLE IN THE CLASSROOM. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE TEACHERS HAVE UP TO DATE AND AGE APPROPRIATE AN EXPERT APPROVED RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. HI THIS BILL IS A JEWISH CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL HAS A WIDE GROUP OF SUPPORT INCLUDING THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OF AMERICA. DASA AND THE HOLOCAUST CENTER THE BILL HAS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION MANAGE HERE WE HAVE WITNESSES- AVAILABLE MORGAN BLOOM SCHNEIDER WITH JEWISH FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES HOLOCAUST CENTER.

EACH YEAR THE HOLOCAUST CENTER REACHES MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND TEACHERS FROM HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS. YOUR MEETING WITH SURVIVORS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS FOR TEACHERS STUDENT SEMINARS AND A WORLD CLASS LIBRARY OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND BOOKS. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU AN ALARMING STATISTIC FOLLOWING THE HOLOCAUST CENTER WORKSHOP THIS FALL PARTICIPATING EDUCATORS REPORTED THAT 90% OF THEM HAD WITNESSED ANTI SEMITISM ON THEIR CAMPUSES. THANK IS MADE EVEN MORE CONCERNING THE WHEN THE RECENT WORDS US SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN ARE CONSIDERED. COULD HATRED OF THE JEWS TEND TO GO HAND IN HAND WITH HATRED OF OTHERS INCLUDING LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE PEOPLE OF COLOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND REFUGEES. CURRENTLY ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES IN HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE EDUCATION IS THAT TEACHERS ARE MANDATED TO INCLUDE LESSONS ON THE HOLOCAUST BUT THEY ARE LARGELY LEFT ON THEIR OWN TO DEVELOP THOSE LESSONS. CURRENTLY NO STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT CORRESPONDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AS A RESULT MANY SIMPLY USE THE LESSONS THEY THEMSELVES LEARNED AS A STUDENT DECADES AGO. TEACH THE HOLOCAUST TODAY. I SHARE THIS WITH YOU AT THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE GREAT NEED RIGHT NOW TO IDENTIFY AND ADOPT BEST PRACTICES TO THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS AND FACILITATE EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION ON THE HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE.

YOU KNOW WE TALKED THEY MADE REFERENCE TO THE ARMENIAN CAMBODIAN RWANDA GENOCIDE CIVILS THE HOLOCAUST OF BUSINESS THAT WE HAD DURING THE RANDOM MUSLIM MINORITY THAT WAS JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND FRANKLY- TALKING ABOUT THE ROLE- SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER TYPES OF MEDIA HAVE IN TERMS OF- ITS POTENTIAL INCITING HATE AND EVENTS AND ACTUALLY GENOCIDE IS THE MOST EXTREME EXPRESSION OF THAT- AND- IT I THINK I'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION- THIS YEAR'S THEME AND HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY IS FOR MANY SURVIVORS AS IT BEGAN WITH WORDS. RIGHT SO. WE CAN TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT THE- OUR WHAT'S AND SO FORTH BUT IT BEGAN WITH THE WORD.

AND SO I WOULD POINT OUT THAT NEW YORK TIMES ACTUALLY REPORTED THAT FACEBOOK ACTUALLY WAS HARNESSED BY THE MILITARY TO PUT OUT PROPAGANDA FACED- FALSE NEWS INFLAMMATORY POSTS THAT LED TO THE- DOWNSIDE OF THE RAIN GOT. IN FACT FACEBOOK ITSELF REFUSE THE BAND- HOLOCAUST DENIAL UNTIL LITERALLY TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS JUST LAST YEAR- SO. IT'S NOT JUST THE PAST CONVERSATION IT'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WHAT TYPE OF POLICIES WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE PREVENT. FUTURE GENOCIDE AND HATE AS WELL SO CERTAINLY NOT VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HOPE WE CAN CORPORATE SOME THIS CONCEPTS IN THE EDUCATION SO IT'S ALL IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE PAST ABOUT THE FUTURE.
