ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB NINE SEVEN EIGHT HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. NO OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS AND WE'LL START WITH FILE ITEM AIDS. AB. TEN FORTY NINE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON WHICH LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TEN FORTY NINE WILL PROVIDE A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR EQUIPMENT PURCHASED BY CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS. VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE A CRUCIAL PART OF SERVING AND PROTECTING THE STATE FROM THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES. IT'S MATTER FACT THEY COMPRISED DEPARTMENTS. THERE ARE MOSTLY FOUNDED RULE AND SMALLER COMMUNITIES AND AT BEST THEY ARE ONLY MODESTLY FUNDED. THEY ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE THE SAME STAFF AND EQUIPMENT TO FIGHT CALIFORNIA'S RAGING WILDFIRES AS OTHER FULLY FUNDED FIRE DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS. EXISTING LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR EQUIPMENT PURCHASED BY CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS. AB TEN FORTY NINE WILL PROVIDE A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR EQUIPMENT PURCHASED BY THESE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS. AND IT WILL SAY THE IT WILL SAVE THE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS ABOUT TWO MILLION STATEWIDE. THIS NEW EQUIPMENT THAT WILL REPLACE DECADES OLD MACHINES WILL MAKE OUR CITIZENS SAFER AND OUR FIREFIGHTERS MORE EFFECTIVE MY WITNESSES WITH ME ALLOWED HIM TO SELF INTRODUCED FROM CROCKETT CARQUINEZ FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT. BEFORE YOU DO WE HAVE A QUORUM -- CAN CALL THE ROLL. BURKE HERE. ROW [inaudible] TO YOUR GRAY [inaudible] MAYES [inaudible] MELENDEZ MULLIN [inaudible] PETRIE-NORRIS. QUIRK HERE. PREVIOUS TANG.

STATE. MY NAME IS DEAN COLOMBO LINE THE FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CROCKER CARQUINEZ FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT. I BECAME CHIEF IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR WE'RE SMALL DISTRICT WE COVER TEN SQUARE MILES WE COVER THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT COST A CROCK IN THE SMALL TOWN OF FOR ME [inaudible] THE BURDEN. ON SMALL FIRE DEPARTMENTS. HAS BECOME EXPONENTIALLY. GREATER [inaudible] IN YEARS. WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THE FAR SERVICE THIRTY SIX YEARS AGO MUTUAL AID? TO YOUR NEIGHBORS WAS AN EVENT THAT WAS FAIRLY RARE. NOW IT IS ALL THE TIME. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE GREAT FIRES IN NINETEEN FIVE IN LEXINGTON RESERVOIR FIRE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE MUTUAL AID. PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAS BECOME THE NORM. AND THE LAST TWO YEARS. JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT. THESE FIRES ARE A VERY LARGE -- COMPONENT OF WHAT WE DO THE WEAR AND TEAR ON OUR EQUIPMENT IS SUBSTANTIAL. AND WE NEED HELP. WE ARE CURRENTLY -- FOR EXAMPLE MY DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY PUTTING OUT TO BID FOR NEW LADDER TRUCK FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE REPLACING A TRUCK THAT WAS PURCHASED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE IT IS WELL BEYOND IT'S TIME BUT WE'VE HAD TO HOLD ON TO IT. FOR THIS AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE IT IS SO EXPENSIVE. WHEN WE DO PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE IS GOING TO COST? A LITTLE BIT GREATER THAN NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. THE FIRE ENGINE TO YOU SEE TYPICALLY AT THE RESPONDING TO THE CALIFORNIA WILDLAND FIRES A LARGE TYPE THREES ARE DOLLARS A PIECE. AT THAT AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN OUR ENTIRE BUDGET FOR A YEAR. WE'RE NOT ONLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE DO AS FAR AS PROTECTING CALIFORNIA FROM WILDLAND FIRES BUT WE ARE SERVING OUR NEIGHBORS. THE LITTLE TOWN OF CROCKETT IS SURROUNDED BY DISTRICTS LIKE THE CITY OF VALLEJO. RODEO HERCULES FIRE DISTRICT COUNT CONTRA COSTA COUNTY CONSOLIDATED FIRE DISTRICT PANEL CITY AND OTHER DISTRICTS OF HAD TO CUT BACK. AFTER THE RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WE HAVE FILLED PART OF THE GAP FOR THEM AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DO SO. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ABOUT VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENTS ABOUT HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS WHEN OUR NEIGHBORS CALL WHETHER IT'S THE CITY OF VALLEJO OR ITS TRINITY COUNTY WE ARE GOING TO BE THERE WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP THEM. WE'RE ASKING THE STATE TO HELP US IN THAT. IT'S NOT ONLY FIRE TRUCKS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE MUCH OF THE AIR BOTTLES THAT WE CARRY ON OUR BACKS ARE SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENT IS AFTER SO MANY YEARS THEY MUST BE REPLACED THERE THOUSAND DOLLARS A COPY. AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO PLACE BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY OF THEM. THESE ARE MASSIVE EXPENSES. WE ARE HELPING EACH OTHER WE ARE A VITAL PART OF THE CALIFORNIA MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND I AND AND TEXTING CITIZENS WE PROTECT HIGHWAYS WE WE IN ARE WE PROTECTING INTERSTATE. EIGHTY A MAJOR CALIFORNIA THOROUGHFARE THERE'S NO TAX DOLLARS FROM THAT. BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT BECAUSE WE'RE HELPING EACH OTHER AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT FOR US. WANT TO CLOSE THE JUST TO HIGHLIGHT HOW WHAT -- WHAT'S HAPPENING -- IN THE NEWS THIS PAST WEEKEND THERE WAS A REPORT ON CBS RADIO. REGARDING THE MULTIPLE VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENTS IN CINEMA COUNTY. THEY'RE HAVING TO CONSOLIDATE RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE LOSS IN TAX REVENUE BECAUSE OF THE NORTH BAY FIRES. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT BUTTE TRINITY COUNTY. LAKE COUNTY ARE GOING EXPERIENCE VERY SIMILAR THINGS. WE NEED YOUR HELP -- HELP THOSE THAT ARE REACHING OUT AND HELPING THEIR NEIGHBORS. I THANK YOU AGAIN. BENJAMIN PALMER ON BEHALF OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WERE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU JUST AWARENESS IS IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BY THE COURT WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE ACTUALLY DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL ON THIS BILL AT THIS TIME WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL NATURE. I IT WOULD SET IN TERMS OF SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF PUBLIC A QUICK MEN IN THIS WAY THE SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION -- CERTAINLY WE WOULD PREFER A GENERAL UND ALLOCATION WE DO CONSIDER THIS. TO BE A LOT OF ALL PUBLIC POLICY GOAL WE'RE JUST CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THAT IT SETS AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION XENON COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DOCTOR PARK. SO YEAH THAT'S THE THE ISSUE HERE IS YOU NEED THE MONEY. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THE PROBLEM IS WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT -- I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT. THESE -- DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE AND WHOSE WELL FUNDED AND WHO ISN'T. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. YOU COULD END UP WITH A RELATIVELY WELL OFF -- DISTRICT GETTING A BIG BREAK AND THE SMALL DISTRICT THE CAN CAN'T REALLY EVEN PURCHASE EQUIPMENT GETTING NO BREAK AT ALL. AND THAT WOULD BE MY CONCERN WITH THAT. APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO A GRANT REAP GRANT APPROACH -- SO THAT'S THE OTHER WELL THERE'S ONE OTHER ISSUE WHICH IS PROP NINETY EIGHT DEPENDS UPON A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COMES INTO THE STATE. AND ONCE YOU DECREASE THE TAXES COLLECT COLLECTED THOUGH YOU DON'T MEAN TO CUT THE MONEY. GOING TO THE SCHOOLS IN AFFECTED CUTS THE MONEY GOING TO THE SCHOOLS. IF YOU HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM THAT MONEY COMES OUT OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GENERAL FUND. SO THERE COUPLE OF REASONS THAT A GRANT PROGRAM MIGHT BE A BETTER PROGRAM THAN. A SALES TAX. REMITTANCE PROGRAM BOTH FOR EDUCATION AND FOR MAKING SURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- WHERE DO YOU SPEND IT WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE AND WHAT IT SIMPLY -- TAX MEASURE YOU MAY NOT BE SENDING IT TO THE MOST NEEDY DISTRICT. YES IF I MAY I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF I HEARD A QUESTION IN THAT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND OKAY -- IF I MADE MADAM CHAIR AND THE FIRST THING -- ON THE SUGGESTION OF A GRAND I RESPECTFULLY -- RECEIVE THE COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUE -- MISSED WORK BUT ON THE GRANT -- PROCESS A GREAT SUGGESTION HOWEVER. IN A GRANT PROCESS NORMALLY IT COSTS AN ENTITY TO APPLY FOR A GRANT -- NORMALLY THEY WOULD HAVE TO HIRE ON A POSITION OR REACH OUT TO SOMEONE THAT IS -- THAT DOES THAT IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY TO EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO QUALIFY FOR A GRANT. THEREFORE RISKING -- THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PAYING OUT MONEY TO BE A PART OF THIS GRANT PROCESS. AND MOST LIKELY WALKING AWAY WITHOUT THE GRANT SO -- I DO UNDERSTAND THAT AND RESPECT THAT -- HOWEVER IN A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS. IT IT IS -- DESIGNED TO REACH THE RULE -- AREAS MAINLY THAT ARE UNDER SERVED I'M NOT SURE IF WE WOULD FIND VERY MANY FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE VOLUNTEER AND SAN FRANCISCO OR LA FRESNO OR SACRAMENTO -- IT'S MOSTLY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE WILDFIRES ARE HAPPENING. SO -- THE TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD BE LOST FROM THOSE WILD FIRES ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT WOULD BENEFIT VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS. PLACE YOUR BRO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- CHIEF REAL QUICK IS HAVE YOU EXPLORED THE OPPORTUNITIES OF MILITARY SURPLUS EQUIPMENT MAY BE USED EQUIPMENT FROM SOME OF THE BIGGER. ENTITIES IN THE STATE. YES THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING IS THE FOLLOWING A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF DEPARTMENTS. PAID AND VOLUNTEER ARE STRUGGLING SO MUCH THAT BY THE TIME A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS PUT UP FOR SURPLUS. IT IS BEYOND IT'S TIME. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE TRUCK THAT WE'RE GOING TO PURCHASE. BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE SIZE OF THE COMMUNITY THE SIZE OF OUR FIRE STATIONS SUCH WE ARE REQUIRED TO GO OUT AND GET SOMETHING THAT CAN FIT. THAT IS NOT AVAILABLEON THE OPEN USED MARKET -- SO THAT'S WHY NOW WE ARE. GOING TO BEYOND. OUR OWN FUNDING. WE'RE LOOKING OUT TO LOCAL INDUSTRY WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR A BEER QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND REPLACEMENT FUNDS WE'RE REACHING OUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO GET THE MONEY TO REPLACE THESE EQUIPMENT AND IT'S JUST NOT MOBILE EQUIPMENT. I DID I TALKED ABOUT AIR PACKS WERE TALKING ABOUT -- DEFEAT BE LAY ALL THE THINGS THAT -- WE ARE REQUIRED [inaudible] TO REPLACE [inaudible] UPDATE. BASED ON STATUTE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND JUST OF STANDARD SUCH AS NFPA. SOUL THE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE CONFRONTING AND MISTRESSES ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SAT THING REGARDING THE GRANTS I APPRECIATE THE THE IDEA GRANTS THE PROBLEM IS. THAT A GRANT USUALLY AND WE ARE REACHING OUT FOR GRANTS THROUGH FEMA. BUT THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT SO MANY GRANTS ARE SO LIMITED -- NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT WE HAVE TO BUY THESE THINGS. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF WELL IF WE DON'T GET THE GRANT WE DON'T BUY IT NO THOSE THEIR THEIR PACK BALLS MUST BE REPLACED. THE FIRE ENGINE MUST BE REPLACED -- AND THE THE OTHER THING WOULD SAY THIS. THE COST OF KEEPING OLD APPARATUS. IN SERVICE THE KERN APPARATUS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS REPLACING WE CAN'T FIND PARTS ANYMORE FOR IT THE COMPANY THAT BUILT IT IS GONE. AND IT SOLD SO THE COST OF MACHINING THINGS AND SUCH IT'S ASTRONOMICAL IT'S NICKEL AND DIMING US TO DEATH [inaudible] SO [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUDGE I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. JUST JEFF YEAH YESTERDAY I ATTENDED TO SPRING VALLEY VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS PRACTICE IN FUND RAISING YOUR BAND -- I I SEE THE NEED -- FOR FOR THIS BILL I ALSO ON TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK ALL THE VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS TO ALL CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK MOVING THE FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB. EIGHT SEVENTY TWO ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'D FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING ROSE MERRY KINNEY FOR HER GREAT ANALYSIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AB EIGHT SEVEN TWO WILL HELP CHILDREN ON SMALL FAMILY FARMS STAY IN THEIR HOMES AFTER THE DEATH OF A PARENT. PARENT CHILD EXCLUSIONS GENERALLY PREVENT PROPERTY TAX REASSESSMENT FROM PROPERTY CHANGES HANDS WITHIN THE FAMILY. FROM PARENT TO CHILD. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THESE EXCLUSIONS BECAUSE THEY HELP CHILDREN STAY IN THEIR FAMILY HOME AFTER THE LOSS OF A PARENT. DUE TO THE SMALL GAP IN OUR COMPLICATED TAX LAWS NOT ALL SMALL FAMILY FARM HOME STIFF ARE PROVIDED A PARENT CHILD EXCLUSION. AB EIGHT SEVEN TWO ELIMINATES THIS GAP IN THE LAW WHICH WILL PROTECT SMALL FAMILY FARMERS AND AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURAL OPEN SPACE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I WROTE OUR STATE TREASURER FIONA MALL IS SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION SHE DISCOVERED THIS INEQUITY IN OUR TAX LAWS DURING HER TIME AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. A REPRESENTATIVE CASEY O'CONNOR IS HERE TODAY TO TALK TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. HI YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR SEEING US IN CASE YOUR CAR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR TREASURER FEE ON A MOCK WHEN THE TREASURE WAS THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A CASE -- APPEARED BEFORE US AND WHICH KIND OF BROUGHT THIS LOOPHOLE TO OUR ATTENTION AS THESE ON THE WOMAN NOTED THE CASE REVOLVED AROUND A SMALL FAMILY FARM -- HOMESTEAD THOSE CONTINUOUSLY OWN SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THAT HAD BEEN REASSESSED FROM ITS INITIAL WILLIAMS ACT PROP THIRTEEN PROTECTIVE VALUE. TO ITS MARKET VALUE WHEN THE OWNERS DIED IN OWNERSHIP OF THE FARM TRANSFER TO THE CHILDREN THE REASSESSMENT LED TO A SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY TAX INCREASE WHICH THREATEN THE CHILDREN'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE LIVING IN THE FARM WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THEIR WHOLE LIVES -- THE BOARD HAD SAID AT THAT TIME THAT THEY BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A BILL TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE BOARD HAS CHANGED OVER BUT THE TREASURER HAD SAID THAT SHE WANT TO SEE THIS TO PULL CLOSE THAT'S WHY WE'RE BRINGING IT UP NOW. AND THIS BILL IS REALLY NARROW IN SCOPE TO ADDRESS -- THE FOLKS THAT WERE INCORPORATED AFTER PROP THIRTEEN BUT BEFORE PROP FIFTY EIGHT WAS IN PLACE AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THOSE FOLKS TO RESOLVE THIS INEQUITY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR SUPPORT WHEN IT COMES UP FOR ABOUT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL IN IS IS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS REGINA EVANS CHIEF DEPUTY TO THE CURRENT BOARD OF EQUALIZATION CHAIR MOLINA COME WHEN. MISS COLEMAN AGREES WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LEGISLATION AT THIS TIME SHE'S NOT REGISTERING A FORMAL POSITION BUT SHE BELIEVES IT'S WORK WE SHOULD SERIOUSLY TAKE A LOOK AT UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE RECENT AMENDMENT. OF THE BILL THE BOARD HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FORMALLY TAKE A POSITION BUT WE WILL DO SO PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL VOTE ON THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL INTEREST IS IN OPPOSITION TO COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE. I DON'T WORK. I'M GREAT BILL. THANK YOU I AGREE THANK YOU THANK YOU -- FOR THIS IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVING TO FILE ITEM NUMBER. ONE EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT ESTABLISH THE ABLE ACT IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS OUR ANNUAL CLEAN UP BILL TO CONFORM WITH FEDERAL LAWS. AB SEVEN THREE SIX WILL ALLOW THE ROLL OVER A FUNDS FROM A COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN TO A CAL ABLE ACCOUNT WITHOUT STATE TAX PENALTY. LAST YEAR CONGRESS PASSED LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FOR THESE TRANSFERS WITHOUT. INCURRING A TAX LIABILITY AND THE CHANGE IS NOT YET BEEN REFLECTED IN CALIFORNIA THERE FOR THIS BILL WILL. ADDRESS THE DISCREPANCY. AB SEVEN THREE SIX WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE BY ALLOWING THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS INTO AN ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAT HAS MORE FLEXIBILITY. WITH NEAR HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CAL A GOLD A CAL ABLE PROGRAM DANTE ALAN. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DANTE ALLEN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CAL ABLE. I JOIN TREASURER MA -- THE CHAIR OF THE CALLIE LACK BOARD IN OFFERING AT THE ESSEX SUPPORT FOR A BI. SEVEN THREE SIX WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR WIN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AS SHE HAS DONE SO MANY TIMES. AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAL ABLE I SPEAK REGULARLY WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WE'VE ALREADY MADE THE DECISION. OR ARE CLOSE TO THE DECISION TO OPEN IN KALIBO ACCOUNT -- THE ABLE ACT HAS BEEN A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE FOR MANY OF THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE VOCAL ENERGETIC. ABOUT THE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM IN SUPPORT AS LONG TERM. SUSTAINABILITY. A LARGE PART OF THAT SUCCESS WILL BE BASED ON OUR ABILITY RETAIN THE TRUST OF THE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCEPTING CALIBER FOR FINANCIAL. FOR THE FINANCIAL INCLUSION OPPORTUNITY IF IT IS. MANY OF THOSE EXPRESSING INTEREST IN ABLE OUR FIRST TIME SAVERS AND INVESTORS AND HAVE PRECIOUS FEW RESOURCES TO LOSE DUE TO A MISUNDERSTANDING OF NON CONFORMING. STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. PARENTS WHO OPENED A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CHILD. WHO NOW WANT TO ROLL IT OVER? TO AN ABLE PLAN AFTER LEARNING THE CHILD HAS A DISABILITY RUNS THE RISK OF LOSING MONEY TO TAXES AND PENALTIES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY SEE. THE MOST FLEXIBLE VEHICLE TO INVEST AND SAVE FOR THEIR CHILD'S FUTURE. THE TRUST LEVEL OF THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LOW. AFTER ALL YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOLD FOR DECADES -- NEVER TO SAVE MONEY AND THE NAME OF THE PERSON WITH THE DISABILITY. AND THEY'VE BEEN GIVING CONFLICTING INFORMATION BY THE AGENCIES THAT. THE ABLE ACT WAS INTENDED TO PROTECT. AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH TWENTY NINETEEN THERE FORTY THREE PROGRAMS IN OPERATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ALLOW PARTICIPATION BY NON RESIDENTS. CURRENTLY SEVERAL EIGHT ABLE PROGRAMS EXIST IN STATES WHERE CONFORMITY WITH THIS TAX PROVISION HAS ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED. THE CALIFORNIA ABLE PROGRAM LAUNCHED ON DECEMBER. EIGHTEENTH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT BEGAN COMPETING WITH THESE OTHER STATES PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT IN OPERATION FOR OVER TWO YEARS. AND HAVE MARKETED TO ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. THEREFORE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAXIMIZE INCENTIVES THAT INCREASED CALLIE WAS PARTICIPATION AND ULTIMATELY AS LONG TERM VIABILITY IN SUCCESS. THAT INCLUDES ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S NOT BE SUBJECTED TO TAXES AND PENALTIES THAT OTHER PROGRAMS HAD MANAGED TO AVOID. SINCE DECEMBER -- SINCE OUR DECEMBER LAUNCH. WE HAVE BEEN MET WITH WIDESPREAD SUCCESS. AS OF THIS MORNING NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN OPENS -- WITH OVER THREE POINTONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT AB -- SEVEN THREE SIX IN ADDITION TO ELIMINATING THE TAXES AND PENALTIES DUE TO A ROLL OVER FROM A COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAM WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER. OF INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO ELECT TO OPEN -- ABLE COUNTS WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL FURTHER PROMOTE CONSISTENT SAVINGS FOR BEHAVIOR AMONG CALIFORNIA'S WITH DISABILITIES. THANK YOU FIRST CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR FAST FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE TO HAVE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES HERE YOU JUST COME TO THE TABLE. I'M SURE MEMBERS TO ME FROM IN DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT THE PROMPT SPORT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT QUIRK -- I LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRANSFER -- YOUR RETIREMENT SAVINGS. FROM ONE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER WITHOUT PAYING THE TAXES I THINK THIS IS COMPARABLE I THINK IT MAKES SENSE I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT FORWARD. HIGH PRAISE FROM DOCTOR QUIRK IT REALLY IS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING THEM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. JUST -- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE THANK YOU DESIGNS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY THANK YOU. ARE YOU HAVE A FILE ITEM. NUMBER FIVE AB. EIGHTY FIVE OF AB HAD EIGHT EIGHT FIVE WILL HELP THE VICTIMSOF THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES GET BACK ON THEIR FEET BY PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED PROPERTY TAX RELIEF. THOMAS FIRE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN RESULTED IN THIRTEEN HUNDRED STRUCTURES DESTROYED OR DAMAGED IT WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE IN STATE HISTORY UNTIL. TWENTY EIGHTEEN I WAS -- SEVENTEEN WHEN THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX CAMPAñA BUTTE AND WILLS HE FIRED DECIMATED THOUSANDS OF MORE HOMES AND BUSINESSES. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A TRANSFER OF ONE'S PROPERTY TAX LIABILITY FROM THE DESTROYED PROPERTY TO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTY SO A VICTIMS PROPERTY TAXES DO NOT SPIKE. CURRENT LAW ALSO PROVIDES AT THE NEW PROPERTY WILL BE UP TO A HUNDRED AND 20%. OF THE VALUE A CAN BE UP TO A HUNDRED AND 20% OF THE VALUE OF THE DESTROYED PROPERTY. PROVIDING A SMALL SAFE HARBOR FOR IMPROVEMENTS ABOVE THE ORIGINAL VALUE WITHOUT TRIGGERING A REASSESSMENT. THE SAME STANDARD OF A HUNDRED AND 20% DOES NOT EXIST FOR PROPERTY OWNERS WHO WISH TO REBUILD ON THEIR CURRENT SITE. AB EIGHT EIGHT FIVE CORRECT SAID IN EQUITY AND CURRENT LAW BY DEFINING SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT. TO PROVIDE THE SAME HUNDRED AND 20% STANDARD OF SIZE OR VALUE FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO REBUILD ON THE SAME PLOT OF LAND. ON THAT THAT THE DESTROYED PROPERTY STOOD ON THEIR SIMILAR PROVISIONS FOR THOSE WHO LOSE PROPERTY DUE TO EMINENT DOMAIN OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION. BY CREATING CONFORMITY WITH OTHER AREAS OF PROPERTY TAX LAW AB EIGHT EIGHT FIVE WILL HELP SUPPORT THOSE WHO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING AND ARE STRUGGLING TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION I'M ROB GROWS CLOSER -- AND MUCH MY WEST MAY I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH A SHORT LAST NAME LIKE YOUR CHIEF CONSULTANT FOR MY SWISS RELATIVES -- BUT I WANT TO THINK THE SALOON FOR BRINGING FORWARD AB -- EIGHT EIGHT FIVE THIS RESULTED FROM OUR ASSOCIATION COMING TOGETHER THIS PAST FALL AND HAVING A COMBAT THE DISCUSSION ON DISASTER -- DISASTERS IN THE STATE AND HOW TO ASSESS THEM AND WE NOTICES INEQUITY WHERE IF YOUR HOME IS. DESTROYED YOU CAN MOVE ACROSS THE STREET THERE'S A STANDING ON PURCHASE IT UP TO THE WANTED 20% VALUE. BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY TO REBUILD ON THE PLOT OF LAND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT. FLEXIBILITY SO TO SPEAK EVEN GO OUTSIDE THE COUNTY TWO HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED TEN AND 5015% AND THAT'S YOU KNOW EXITING YOUR ACTUAL COMMUNITY THERE -- SO LIKE TEN THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER NEXT ANALYSIS I DO AGREE WITH THAT THAT THIS IS ABOUT RESTORING THE PROPERTY TAX HAS ACTUAL LEVEL THIS IS NOT DECREASING IN. A PLOT OF LAND COULD SAY VACANT AND THEY'VE VALUES WOULD BE DOWN WHICH WOULD BE HURTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES ALREADY WITH THAT LOST PROPERTY TAX BASE. SO WITH THAT WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT. A JUST COME TO THE TABLE. THERE ARE CARL TO THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. I WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND ME DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO JUST READING THE ANALYSIS IT SAID PROP EIGHT ESTABLISHED A NEW CONSTRUCTION EXCLUSION RELATED TO POST DISASTER RECONSTRUCTION. SPECIFICALLY REAL PROPERTY THESE RECONSTRUCTED AFTER DISASTERS CLEARED BY THE GOVERNOR WILL NOT BE ASSESSED AS NEW CONSTRUCTION. IF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE THE READ. REAL PROPERTY. AS RECONSTRUCTED IS COMPARABLE SO THERE IS. A AND PERHAPS THE ASSESSOR CAN ANSWER THIS THERE IS SOME PROVISION IN LAW THE PROBLEM IS THAT. COMPARABLE REALLY ISN'T DEFINED AND NOW YOU'RE DEFINING THAT. AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE BILL IS DOING. YOU ALREADY HAVE SOME EXCLUSION IT'S JUST HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT EXCLUSION IS. SO OKAY GOOD [inaudible] THANKS ROGER. SO INTENTIONALLY BRING HIS BILL FOR ALL THE SUPPORT AND WHEN WE VOTE ON IT -- IT'S A NO BRAINER BUT I I THINK FOR THE ASSESSORS WHICH WE SHOULD GO A LITTLE FARTHER BECAUSE I'LL GIVE YOU MY OWN EXPERIENCE. I BOUGHT A HOME IN DANA POINT THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE IT NEEDED TO BE. FIXED UP -- I DIDN'T AB ONE SQUARE INCH DIDN'T FIX TOUCH THE ROOF DIDN'T TOUCH THE YARDS BUT I YOU KNOW PUT NEW RECEPTACLES ARE IN THERE BUT THE BUILDING IF ISSUE. ADDED HE SAID ALL YOUR COMPUTER WORKS CAN BE TWO OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WAS ALL SUBJECTIVE BUT THEN A CC THE ASSESSOR. AND I THINK I'M DOING A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLAR REMODEL WHICH I'M NOT AND IT GOES ON THE PROPERTY TAXES. AND THEN SO SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE I THINK JUST IF YOU'RE FIXING UP AT ALL PLACE. YOU KNOW YOU CAN ARGUE IF A NEW LIGHT SWITCH IN A NEW RECESS OUTLET IS. VALUE TO YOUR PROPERTY -- THE OTHER ISSUE THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT TWO IS THAT. IF THE ASSESSORS THIS HAPPENED WITH MY PROPERTY IF YOU'RE OVER ASSESSING THE VALUE BASED ON A CONSTRUCTION -- AND THEN WHEN IT SELLS THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO RIGHT TO GET ANY OF THAT MONEY BACK SO OUR PROPERTY IS BEING OVER SAYS BASED ON THIS CONSTRUCTION THOUGHT. THAT WE WERE DOING A TO A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REMODEL FOR ONE AND IN FACT IT WASN'T THE CASE AND WHEN WE SOLD IT YOU KNOW IT WAS. SOLD AT A DIFFERENT AMOUNT SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS FOR YOU GUYS TO CONSIDER MAKE ISRAEL TAKE THE BACK TO CESSATION SHOULD. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THIS INEQUITY OBVIOUSLY IT IS MOSTLY ABOUT A DEFINITION AND SO THANK YOU WHEN THE TIME COMES WE WILL VOTE ON IT. THIS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY NOW THANK YOU THINK ABOUT CHAIR FOR THE MEMBERS [inaudible] I REQUEST LIVING A FILE ITEM SIX AB NINE THIRTY EIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER REAVIS WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- COLLEAGUES AND OR ARE COMMITTEE STAFF. WHILE AUTOMAKERS ARE TAKING STEPS TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND VEHICLES OF ALL SIZES. OUR STATE MUST DO MORE IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF ELECT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE CONSUMER INCENTIVES IF WE ARE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN THE STATE. AB NINE THREE EIGHT INCENTIVIZE IS OWNERS OF OLDER GAS POWERED CARS. TO TRADE IN THEIR VEHICLE AND PURCHASE A NEW OR USED QUALIFYING LOW OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. THIS BILL WOULD ENACT A NEW TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAM IN THE FORM OF A PARTIAL SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION FOR QUALIFIED MOTOR VEHICLES -- AND FOR PURPOSE OF THIS BILL THE QUALIFY MORE -- THE THE QUALIFIED OF MOTOR VEHICLE AS ANY VEHICLE THAT MEETS LOW ULTRA LOW OR ZERO EMISSION STANDARDS SET BY FEDERAL GUIDELINES -- THIS BILL -- IT DEFINES TRADE IN VEHICLE AS A VEHICLE THAT IS ELEVEN MODEL YEARS OLD OR OLDER. AND IF WE TARGET OLDER OFTEN LESS EFFICIENT VEHICLES ON THE ROAD AND POTENTIALLY ENCOURAGING OWNERS OF SUCH VEHICLES TO PURCHASE LOW OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THIS PROGRAM. COULD PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING OUR STATE REACH OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TARGETS -- AND FINALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRIVERS OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVES HAS BEEN THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT. UNFORTUNATELY WITH RECENT STATEMENTS MADE BY OUR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THIS FEDERAL INCENTIVE. IS IN REAL JEOPARDY OF BEING EXCLUDED IN THE NEW BUDGET PROPOSAL -- AND SO WITH THAT -- I I HAVE HERE CLIFF CARDOZA WHO WILL PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY IS THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE NEW CAR -- THE DEALER ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MUCH. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CLUB COSTA WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION TOTALLY BUT NO NO WORRIES NO WORRIES -- THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THIS BILL IN VARIOUS FORMATS OVER THE YEARS IN FACT THE STEAM CHAIR HAD A BILL SIMILAR BILL TWO YEARS AGO. BUT THE REASONS FOR THE BILL HAVE CHANGED A LOT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS IS WHAT. THE AUTHOR JUST MENTIONED THE FEDERAL TAX FEDERAL TAX CREDIT OF SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS IN REAL JEOPARDY NOW. THE PRESIDENT HAS PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THIS. FEDERAL TAX CREDIT. THE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS THE BIGGEST PUSH. WHAT HAPPENS BUT NOT OVER 90% OF ZERO NEWS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE LEAST? THE LEASING COMPANIES WHICH TYPICALLY -- ARE SO SEATED WITH THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS TAKE THE TAX CREDIT FOR THE CUSTOMER AND REDUCES THE LEASE. PAYMENTS. THE CUSTOMER HAS TO PAY ANOTHER WORDS IT IS ON THE HOOD TIGHT. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO PAY LESS EVERY SINGLE MONTH. YES THE STATE HAS THE CV OUR P. PROGRAM IT IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM THE C. V. R. P. IS RUNNING OUT OF MONEY EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND EVERY YEAR WE KEEP REDUCE SEEN OUR LEAST TALKING ABOUT REDUCING THE INCOME CAPS. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. POOR PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING MY MOTHER. WOULDN'T HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE A NEW ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD GIVE HER. THIS BILL FOCUSES NOT JUST ON NEW ZAPS BUT ALSO AND USE UPS WHERE THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF INCENTIVES AT ALL TO GET INTO USED ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. I RECENTLY JUST PURCHASED A USED A FIAT FIVE HUNDRED E. GOES NINETY MILES IT IS MY COMMUTER CAR BACK AND FORTH TAKES ME TO MY MOTHER IN LAW'S TAKES ME TO MY FAMILY. THAT CAR WAS PURCHASED FOR EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT'S THREE YEARS ALL HAD TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND MILES ON IT. THAT IS THE TYPE OF CAR WERE SOMEBODY COULD TRADE IN THEIR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD VEHICLE AND GET SOMETHING CLEANER. IT IS IMPROVING THE FLEET IT IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IN THESE ARE. HONEST TO GOODNESS REAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TIME ON GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT IS SOMETHING MY FOLKS ARE FOCUSED ON WE WANT TO HELP SELL MORE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO INCREASE CONSUMER DEMAND. THIS BILL WILL HELP CREATE INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND. ONE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY BEFORE -- I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT WHEN IT DOES COME UP. IF IT DOES COME UP -- IS RECENTLY A STUDY WAS. PRODUCED AND THERE ARE TWO AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE KNOWN FOR HAVING THE OLDEST VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. THOSE TWO PLACES ARE THE SAN FRANCISCO SAN JOSE BAY AREA. AND EAST BANK. IN SAN DIEGO. SO OF THE TOP TEN PLACES IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE KEEPING THEIR CARS THE LONGEST HERE AND WE ALL KNOW THE MOST POLLUTING VEHICLES ON THE ROAD OUR OLDER VEHICLES THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT. HEY WE GOT THE MIKE SET UP THEIR MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE BRANDING RC ON BEHALF OF VALLEY CLEAR DOWN TRANSPORT THIS MEASURE. GOOD AFTERNOON WE APPARENTLY ON BEHALF OF TESLA IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE OF VEHICLES. MADE BY CALIFORNIA'S ONLY AUTO MANUFACTURER THANKS -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE ACTUALLY HAVE LIKE A COUPLE OTHER BILLS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY DO NOT OF A POSITION YEAH IT'S MADE THE CORPSMAN AT COMPANY TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF TWO BILLS UP BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE RELATED TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES -- TODAY WOULD NOT HAD A CHANCE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EITHER AUTHORS OFFICE BUT AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY CTO RATE IS NOT OPPOSE INCENTIVIZING -- THE PURCHASE OF WERE YOU SAID ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE CERTAINLY WE HAVE A PRETTY AMBITIOUS GOAL TO MEET AS A STATE BY TWENTY THIRTY ON WHERE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ON THIS BILL ARE TWO FOLD -- ONE AND THERE'S A LARGER CONVERSATION HAPPENING OR WE HOPE WILL BE HAPPENING RECORDING FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY WHERE THE STATE SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT CONFORM OBVIOUSLY THIS POTENTIALLY COULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF CONFORMITY -- IN THE STATE'S TAX CODE AND THE NUMBER -- TWO AND THIS IS THE LARGER ISSUE IS THE USE OF THE GENERAL FUND TO SUBSIDIZE -- THIS TYPE OF INCENTIVE RATHER THAN FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION FUNDS IN ALLOCATING DIRECTLY THROUGH THERE AS PART OF A LARGER TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY SO BETWEEN NOW AND A POTENTIAL VOTE ON THIS WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON NOT SPECIFICALLY THANK YOU. COMES THE QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE. DOCTOR QUIRK. SO MY I HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS. NOW THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE FIRST ONE IS THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED. SOMEBODY ISN'T GOING TO KNOW WHEN THEY SAY I MEAN. NOW AFTER BATTLE LEVIN YEARS THAT'S ABOUT WHEN I TRADE MY CAR AND I HAVE NO IDEA AT THE TIME WHAT THE TRADE IN VALUE WAS GONNA -- AND SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING TO GET BACK. THROUGH THIS TAX BREAK OR EVEN WHAT I'M GOING TO GET FOR THE CAR. SO I DON'T THINK THIS WILL ACTUALLY ACT AS AN INCENTIVE I THINK A BETTER INCENTIVE IS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE WAS AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GET RID OF THEIR CLUNKERS THERE WAS SO MUCH I DON'T REMEMBER THE DETAILS. BUT SO MUCH FOR CLUNKER OR WE CAN JUST MAKE SURE THAT. FRANKLY I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE INCENTIVES. ARE FOR PURCHASE OF SECONDHAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO KEEP THEM ON THE ROAD. OUR BUT AGAIN YOU COULD HAVE A PROGRAM ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS OR ANOTHER FIND. THAT SIMPLY MORE TRANSPARENT THAN THIS MY DIFFICULTY IS THAT THIS JUST ISN'T VERY TRANSPARENT. THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S WORTH UNTIL PRACTICALLY THEY BOUGHT THE CAR. BECAUSE USUALLY DON'T EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT WHAT YOUR TRADING IS RIGHT AWAY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE BLUE BOOK BUT WHO KNOWS WHICH GAP. SO IT'S THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND I JUST THINK OTHER TYPES OF MORE DIRECT INCENTIVES MIGHT WORK BETTER AND PERHAPS YOU COULD PICK ABOUT THAT. IT WAS A GREAT COMMENTS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO I'M ACTUALLY ALSO PRESENTING THE OTHER BELL ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES TODAY I'M JUST A QUESTION IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU SAID THAT IT WAS LOW AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO WHAT ACTUALLY IS WHAT IS A LOW EMISSION VEHICLE. SO I'LL DEFER TO QUIT. YEAH THESE ARE BOTH VEHICLES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO GET THE H. APPEALING STICKER SO WELL LOW EMISSION IS YOUR PLUG IN HYBRID. THE MOST -- COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE CHEVY VOLT BUT THE PREVIOUS PRIME THAT AND OKAY RIGHT I JUST WANT. TO MAKE SURE THANKS. I'M. TO DOCTOR COURTS POINT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE LIKE OUR CLASS CASH FOR CLUNKERS THAT DO TRIED INCENTIVIZE FOLKS TO GET INTO SECOND. HAND THE VEHICLES HOWEVER THE LINE FOR THEM IS THE WAITING LIST FOR THEM IS SO LONG. THAT -- WE WE DO HAVE A BACKLOG AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET. PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND TWO ZERO MISSION AND LOW AND LOW EMISSION VEHICLES AND SPECIALLY THEY WILL ONLY AFFORD SECONDHAND VEHICLES -- SO I CONTINUE TO BE A SUPPORTER OF THAT CONCEPT I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL NOT SEE POR EL THE INTO ALL COMMUNITIES CAN PARTICIPATE AND WE HAVE NOT REACHED THAT POINT YET. OUT WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH YOU KNOW ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS -- YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE -- AND THANK YOU LOOK FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE SURE TO ACCEPT YOU KNOW ANY AND ALL AMENDMENTS AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE BACK IN AND AT THAT TIME WILL -- YOU KNOW RESPECT ASPIRIN AIBO THANK YOU THANK MEMBERS. LIVING FILE ITEM TO AB SEVEN FORTY FIVE HI I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN. CHAIR AND MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RECESSES WALL FOR SETTING THE STAGE. FOR ANOTHER BELL ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOR EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS ALSO TO ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND THIS BILL IS SUBSTANTIVELY REINTRODUCTION OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAURA FRIEDMAN AB THREE THOUSAND WHICH WAS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LAST SESSION. I'M TODAY AS WE SAID THERE APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON OUR ROADS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. CALLING FOR FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY THIRTY SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES LIKE THEIR PLUG IN BATTERY COUNTERPARTS -- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT ARE POWERED BY HYDROGEN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST HYDROGEN PRODUCING STATES AND ITS HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE TAX. SO DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT IS THAT FUTURE CONSUMER ADOPTION AS WE'VE HEARD DOES REMAIN A CHALLENGE. THIS BILL WILL CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THE TWO SEVEN TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IN THE MARKET PLACE TODAY PLUGIN BATTERIES AT EUROVISION VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THE PROPOSED EXEMPTION IS TEMPORARY AND THIS WILL ENABLE US TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THIS POLICY CHANGE. ON THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR THE ANALYSIS AND I THINK FOR YOUR SUGGESTION ON A COUPLE POINTS OF CLARIFICATION THERE IS A QUESTION AROUND. WHERE THIS WOULD APPLY AND IT WOULD APPLY TO BOTH THE? RETAIL SALES HI AND THE THINGS THAT ARE OFFICIALLY CALLED NON RETAIL CELLS BUT ARE STILL. SOLD ON TO CONSUMERS WILL CERTAINLY TAKE ON CAR FIND AMENDMENTS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT AND AND PLEASED TO INTRODUCE OUR TO FOLKS TODAY AS OUR WHICH IS OUR PRIMARY SUPPORTERS. SHANE STEPHENS FROM FIRST ON THAT FUEL AND TO RESET CUT FROM ENERGY INDEPENDENCE NOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS TERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF ENERGY INDEPENDENCE NOW I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE SUPPORTING AB -- SEVEN FORTY FIVE AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN ELOQUENTLY STATED THERE ARE TWO MAIN PURPOSES OF THIS BILL WINE IS THE PARITY AND TAX TREATMENT BETWEEN BOTH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUELS -- AND THEN THE SECOND IS RECOGNIZING THAT FOR THE TIME BEING IN ORDER TO MEET THE ENVIRONMENT ON% CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS THAT THIS STATE HAS WE NEED TO TRY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE -- BARRIERS TO OWNERSHIP -- AND THIS BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY TO DOING NOT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR SHANE STEPHENS ON ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF FIRST ON THE FUEL -- WERE COMPANY FOUNDED AND BASED IN IRVINE CALIFORNIA. AND WE RETAIL HYDROGEN TO KERR'S BOOKS -- THE THE THING WE DO -- SO TODAY WE DO PAY A SALES AND USE TAX OUR CONSUMERS DO -- AT THE PUMP -- BECAUSE OF OLD CODE -- YOU KNOW IT'S ODD FOR A TRANSPORTATION FUEL TO BE TREATED THIS WAY BUT THAT'S THE THE OLD CODE THE WAIT IS. A PLUG IN ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES DO NOT PAY ANY KIND OF NOT TAX WHEN THEY CHARGE UP. BECAUSE OF THAT SB ONE WAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED LAST YEAR -- SO THAT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WOULD PAY A REGISTRATION FEE -- TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT THEY'RE NOT PAYING AT THE PUMP -- HOWEVER FUEL CELL CARS GOT LUMPED INTO THAT CATEGORY. TOO SO NOW WE HAVE THE JOY OF PAYING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE WE PAY AT THE PUMP. AND WE PAY THIS REGISTRATION FEE. SO I THINK THE PARITY ARGUMENT IS A IS A VERY STRONG -- ONE AND WE WOULD LIKE. TO GET TREATED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE PLUGIN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND NOT HAVE A CONSUMERS ALSO BEING. HIT WITH TAXES AT THE PUMP -- THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT -- WE DID VOLUNTARILY INTRODUCE -- SUNSET DATE -- KNOWING THAT DAVID RUFFIN MAKE US DO SO ANYWAY -- BUT THE THE IDEA BEHIND THAT WAS -- YOU KNOW TO GET. LUMPED INTO THIS KIND OF SB ONE CATEGORIZATION OF JOBS FOR NOW. BUT WE THINK IN FOUR YEARS ONCE -- WE'VE GROWN TO A SLIGHTLY LARGER LEVEL WE HELP. OUT WE COULD HAVE A MORE MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW HOW SHOULD HYDROGEN BE TREATED RIGHT SHOULD IT BE -- TAX MORE LIKE GASOLINE SHOULD BE THAT CONTINUE TO BE A REGISTRATION FEE OR YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE EVEN TALKING ABOUT MAYBE A VMT TAX. AND A WHOLE KIND OF OVERALL OF THE CODE SO -- WE HOPE THAT COINCIDES WITH -- ARE SOME SAID THEY COINCIDES WITH A BIGGER DISCUSSION WE CAN HAVE ABOUT THAT -- AND FINALLY I JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT THE REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND -- TODAY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FUEL CELL CARS ON THE ROAD -- THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS -- IT'S AN EXCITING START -- BUT THAT'S A VERY SMALL VOLUME OF CARS -- SOME FUEL IS A VOLUMES GAME RIGHT WHEN WE GET TO MORE SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES THE ECONOMICS WORK VERY WELL WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE. TODAY IS VERY HARD TO BE COMPETITIVE. AND SO OUR PRICES ARE HIGHER AT THE PUMP THAN WHAT WE WOULD LIKE AND WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. BECAUSE OF THAT AUTO MAKERS HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR SOME OF THE FUEL -- THIS IS NUMBER ONE DISCOURAGING TO AUTO MAKERS YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A GAME THAT THEY CAN BE IN LONG TERM TO PAY FOR THE FUEL. NUMBER TWO THE OTHER THING THAT STARTED HAPPENING IS -- AFTER THREE YEARS OF SALES A LOT OF THESE CARS HAVE BEEN EITHER COMING OFF LEASE AND HAVE TO GO INTO THE SECOND HAND MARKET. OR LEAVE FOR THOSE WHO BOUGHT AND OWNED THE CAR THE THREE YEARS OF FREE FUEL PAID BY AUTOMAKERS HAS TIMED UP. SO NOW CONSUMERS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING HIT BY THIS DIRECTLY -- AND IT'S GOING TO I THINK BECAUSE A GROWING PROBLEM OF USED FUEL CELL CARS SITTING ON THE LOT RATHER THAN BEING PUT INTO THEIR THEIR SECOND SECOND LIFE AND I THINK FOR FOR MANY COMMUNITIES AS CHAIRWOMAN UPPER POINTED OUT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT -- THAT USED CAR MARKET SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN GET INTO THE SERVICE. AND DOT RIGHT NOW THE PRICE OF FUEL AT THE PUMP IS CAUSING A PROBLEM SO SO IN ADDITION TO THE PERRY ARGUMENT THIS WILL JUST. HELP US AT THIS POINT WE'RE A SMALL YOU KNOW NON PROFITABLE COMPANY AND INDUSTRY -- GET TO A FASTER WHERE WE CAN COMPETE WITH MORE CONVENTIONAL FUELS THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR ISRAEL SALAS WITH SO CAL GAS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SOME OF THE CARBON WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION I WON'T BELABOR MY EARLIER POINTS BUT LOOK FORWARD TO COMMUNICATING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AS WELL AS THE CHAIR IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A SORT OF LARGER CONVERSATION ON THIS BETWEEN NOW AND A POTENTIAL THOáT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DARKER OF COURSE -- SO I DON'T HIDE WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION. I CAN IMAGINE. WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE THE THE DIFFICULTY IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OWNING HYGIENE VEHICLE. OUR WELL THE BASICALLY GETTING THEM FOR FREE. AND AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY FOR BOTH THE HONDA AND TOYOTA YOU GET THIS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AND THEN THEY PAY FOR YOUR FUEL FURTHER I'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE HONDA PEOPLE THAT WHEN THE THREE YEARS IS UP THEY WANT THE CAR BACK. THEY DON'T WANT IT ON A USED CAR LOT BECAUSE THEY SAY THE TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE CHANGED. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE OUT THERE OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND VEHICLES WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS. THE REASON THAT. THE AUTOMAKERS ARE DOING THIS SUBSIDIZING THE FUEL IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE FUEL COST BUT THESE ARE WERE BETA TESTERS. I HAD TO HAVE THE WHOLE FUEL. TANK REPLACED A FEW MONTHS INTO MY OWNERSHIP BECAUSE IT STOPPED WORKING. AND RIGHT NOW IT'S GONE FROM GETTING. THREE HUNDRED MILES ON A FAILED TO GETTING TO FIFTY SO I'M GOING TO TAKE IT IN AGAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED THE WERE BETA TESTERS. AND MY UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST FROM HONDA IS THEY DON'T EVEN WANT THEM ON THE ROAD ONCE THE LEASE IS UP. SO THIS THEN BECOMES MORE OF A REWARD THAN INCENTIVE NOW IF YOU CAN SHOW ME THERE'S GONNA BE LOTS OF PEOPLE ON THE ROAD. AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT NOW WE PAY THE EQUIVALENT OF EIGHT DOLLARS A GALLON -- THAT IF YOU REDUCE THAT. TO SEVEN TWENTY THAT THAT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK SO BUT MY CONCERN IS THIS REALLY WILD. PROMOTE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE -- AND ALREADY THE STATE WITH A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR REBATE IS AND A STICKER IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR. IS ALREADY PROMOTING THIS IN A MAJOR WAY AND I'M AGAIN I JUST THINK THIS WILL BE A BREAK FOR HONDA AND TOYOTA -- BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY ON IT THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND THEY KNOW WERE BETA TESTERS. AND THEY'RE TREATING THIS VERY NICELY. I WOULD I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THESE ARE YOU THESE ARE NAY SENT TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK AS POLICY MAKERS. YOU I'D LIKE TO SEE AS IT I THINK WE CAN'T -- IT WE'VE GOT WE'VE ALWAYS GOT KIND OF TWO TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL AS POLICY MAKERS IS EITHER REGULATIONS OR INTENT VISITATION THAT'S DESIGNED TO SPARK INNOVATION ENTERED HER CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND I'M. AT A TAKE ON BOARD THAT PERHAPS THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF INCENTIVE IS ATION HAPPENING FOR THE ADOPTION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY SO WE'LL LOOK AT THAT AND WE ALSO GET BACK AT YOU. AND IN TERMS OF OF THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD IN FACT. BENEFIT FROM THE SHIFT THANK YOU THAT BE HELPFUL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I'M SUPER AS I SAID THE PURPOSE OF THIS SPELL IS TO INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION IS YOUR MISSION VEHICLES AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND INPUT AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT ON BOARD AND DIE. THANK YOU ALSO TO MY GUESTS FOR BEING HERE. THINGS LIKE LAST FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WE MOVE THIS FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVING TO FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE AB EIGHT FIFTY SIX THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I DO NOT HAVE ZERO EMISSIONS BILL HERE. I DO HOWEVER HAVE AB EIGHT FIFTY SIX THAT WILL PROVIDE A PERSONAL INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR SENIOR AND DISABLED HOME CARE SERVICES OF UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AB A FIFTY SIX WOULD EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON SENIORS WHO WANT TO STAY IN OUR HOMES BUT NEED HELP WITH THEIR DAILY TASKS. AS THE COST OF SENIOR CARE CONTINUES TO RISE ONE THE MOST AFFORDABLE AND EFFECTIVE OPTIONS FOR SENIORS WHO WISH TO STAY IN THEIR HOME. IS HOME CARE HOME CARE SERVICES ARE PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING SENIORS MORE AFFORDABLE CARE OPTION IN NURSING HOMES AND ARE SUBJECT TO LICENSING AND REGULATION BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AB EIGHT FIFTY SIX WILL CREATE A TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE WHO STRUGGLE TO AFFORD CARE. BUT MAKE TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR STATE FUNDED IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THE BILL PROVIDES A PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO HELP SENIORS ACCOMPLISH EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES. WITHOUT THE EXPENSE OF A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HOME CARE REDUCES HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND READMISSIONS KEEPING DOWN THE COST TO GOVERNMENT FUNDED HEALTH CARE INCLUDING MEDICARE. AND MEDICAID. WITH PEOPLE SEVENTY FIVE AND OLDER BECOMING THE FASTEST GROWING AGE GROUP BY TWENTY TWENTY AND NINE OUT OF TEN AMERICANS AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER WANTING TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THIS BILL IS CRUCIAL TO EMPOWERING SENIORS TO LIVE THOSE ACTIVE LIVES TO REMAIN CONNECTED WITH THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THANK YOU -- WITH ME IN SUPPORT OUR IGNACIO CEPEDA'S FROM BRIGHT STAR CARE AND KATHY HER FELT WITH HOME CARE ASSISTANCE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE MAKING US ASSISTANCE ON THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF PRICE START CARE HAVE BEEN FOR ELEVEN YEARS HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY PROVIDING HOME CARE. AND I'M SURE YOU OFFER FROM HERE WITH IT AND YOU MAY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS OR PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT ARE RECEIVING CARE -- WHEN PEOPLE DON'T RECEIVE CARE IN THE HOME THAT THEY NEED -- THEY DON'T HAVE FAMILY TO SUPPORT THEM -- INEVITABLY ARE THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN DANGER SO THERE'S NEGLECT NEGLECT FOR THEIR OWN CARE THE END UP -- THEIR NUTRITION SUFFERS THEIR SAFETY SUFFERS THEIR ACTIVITY LEVEL STAFFERS WHEN ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS THERE ARE THERE ARE AVOIDABLE FALLS THAT HE NEVER. INEVITABLY TURN TO E. R. VISITS HOSPITAL STAYS. A NURSING HOME -- THIS IT SOMETIMES NURSING HOME STAYS SO THAT'S A ISSUE THE QUESTION IS WHY DON'T PEOPLE HAVE MORE CARE AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK HIS BILL IS ABOUT -- THE PEOPLE IN THE LOW END OF THE SPECTRUM HAVE SOME PUBLIC SUPPORT THROUGH HSS PROGRAM. PEOPLE ARE THE HIGH END OF THE SPECTRUM HAVE DISCRETIONARY INCOME. OR NICE FAT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE POLICIES TO PAY FOR IT BUT PEOPLE ARE IN THE LOWER. LOWER MIDDLE INCOME RANGE CANNOT AFFORD ENOUGH CARE AND IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THIS IS GETTING MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE OVER THE LAST. THREE FOUR YEARS WITH THE ADVENT OF PAID SICK LEAVE OVER TIME. THEY REDUCTION OF SLEEPOVER -- EXCEPTIONS -- AN EXAMPLE IS IT WOULD USED TO BE THE LIVING CARE WHEN SOMEBODY WAS TAKEN CARE FOR SOMEBODY TWENTY FOUR HOURS. A DAY HAS GONE DOWN BY 90%. 90% SO IT IS CERTAINLY AN AFFORDABILITY ISSUE NOW THAT'S EXPENSIVE AND IF THEY CARE SPECTRUM. IN THE LOW AND THE SCARE SPECTRUM I CAN TELL YOU WITH MINIMUM WAGE THE CARE GIVERS IN THIS INDUSTRY MAKE THEIR ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE AT LEAST TO MY COMPANY BUT NOT FAR. SO MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP CARE GOES UP AND HIS HIS LAST YEAR WITH INCREASED TO TWELVE OH CARE WHEN UP AND THAT'S MORE INCREASING IN THE COST OF CARE. HAS CREATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD. SO IS DEFINITELY THERE'S A ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVEN SMALL CHANGES IN THE COST OF CARE. HOW MUCH CARE PEOPLE RECEIVE? SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS -- A TAX CREDIT CAN BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPS AND ACTUALLY THIS REDUCTION OF OURS IS USUALLY AND THE PEOPLE WITH MORE LIMITED INCOME. THE ONES ARE GETTING FOR SIX HOURS OR EIGHT HOURS NOW THEY DIVIDED DOWN INTO TWO FOUR SO FOR HOURS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. SO I THINK THIS TAX CREDIT COULD CERTAINLY SWEET IT HIT A SWEET SPOT IN. ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO READ REMAIN -- PROVIDING CARE FOR THE LOVE ONCE IN THEIR HOME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO BE REALLY BOLD AND SAY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER. TESTIFYING FROM COMMITTEE SO. BEAR WITH ME THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS KATHY HER FELT MY OWN HOME CARE ASSISTANCE HERE ANY SACRAMENTO -- I SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN IT BEFORE I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS AND THE REASON WHY I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS WAS BECAUSE I SAW THE NEED. FOR CARE AND OF THE OF THE RAISING THE BAR FOR CARE IN IN CALIFORNIA HERE -- ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK OF I REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL IS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE SERIOUS CONSTRAINTS IN JUST PROVIDING CARE IN GENERAL. AND WHAT THAT ONE THE REASONS WHY I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS IS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR COMPANIES THAT WERE STARTED BY INTEL KAREN EVASIONS WAS A COME AS WORKING FOR IS THERE WERE STATS THAT SHOW DO WILL NOT BE ENOUGH BRICKS AND MORTAR PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GO. WE HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE DEMAND. OVER BETWEEN NOW AND TWO THOUSAND THIRTY WILL APLEY AGE OUT. THERE WILL NOT BE PLACES TO GO SO WHAT DOES THAT DO IT AND I ALSO READ AN ARTICLE JUST TODAY JUST IN PREPARING FOR THIS. IS THAT OF THE NEAR TIMES POSTED ON MARCH FOURTH THAT IS STATED DUE TO CORPORATE BUYOUTS AND FINANCIAL RUIN MANY SENIOR CARE FACILITIES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS LEAVING SENIORS TO AGE IN THEIR OWN HOMES. SO FRANKLY THE OPTION IS THERE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY IN THEIR HOME. BECAUSE FIRST FOR THE CAN'T AFFORD IT SECONDLY THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY OTHER OPTIONS. SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THESE GUYS WELL. STAYING AT HOME MIGHT BE A GOOD OPTION -- AND MOST OF MY CLIENTS TO WANT TO STAY AT HOME. UT THE RESOURCES WILL NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE DEMAND. THERE'S JUST NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH CARE PEOPLE TO GO AROUND CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW HERE IN EAST EARING YOU SACRAMENTO. I'M RUNNING INTO CONSTRAINTS BECAUSE AMAZON'S HIRING MY PEOPLE AWAY STARBUCKS. THEY'RE ALL PAYING HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE IN THE LABOR FORCE IS SO STRONG RIGHT NOW THE OTHER FOR DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND SO. EVER CONSTRAINTS ARE REALLY. AUG CONSTRAINED WHAT A SECOND TO DO THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME PAY THEM MORE. WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHARGE MY CLIENTS MORE. OKAY SO TO OUR POINT HERE IS THAT CARE IS ONLY GOING TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE. SO HOW CAN WE CREATE SOME SORT OF SAFETY NET FOR OUR CLIENTS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE SURE THE CARE IN THE HOME WHICH FOR HOPE WILL PROBABLY BE THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE. MORE AFFORDABLE. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE HOPEFULLY IT'LL EASE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR SENIORS HERE IN THE MARKET -- IT JUST IT JUST MAKES SENSE WE WE ARE RUNNING INTO. THE TRAIN'S LEFT THE STATION AND WE'RE RUNNING INTO A BRICK WALL UNLESS WE DO SOME SORT OF THING AROUND KEEPING OUR KEY OUR SENIORS SAFE. AT HOME. THANK YOU. THINK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON RATE NEBRASKA HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH SERVICES AT HOME IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TO OPPOSE YOUR BILLS CAR. SHE HAD TO TODAY THAT SHE WAS IN BETWEEN I'M TRYING REAL HARD SADLY WE'RE NOT THE ANALYSIS BUT WE DO IN FACT POSE THIS BILL AND SOME CORPORATE ON BEHALF OF C. T. R. A.. BUT WE DO ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE MERIT ON THIS ISSUE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ATTENDS -- COMPARED TO SOME OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF ATTEMPTING TO NARROW BUT ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT USING THE GENERAL FUND IN THIS WAY -- I BILLION DOLLAR COST FROM THE GENERAL FUND OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO FUND THIS -- PROGRAM ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF WHICH WOULD COME DIRECTLY FROM KEY THROUGH FOURTEEN EDUCATION -- WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT A EXPANSION OF OUR SHORING UP OF AYE HSS OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF GRANT PROGRAM THAT WOULD DIRECTLY ASSIST INDIVIDUALS. IN PROCURING SUPPORTING THESE TYPE OF SERVICES WOULD BE BEST IN MEETING THIS NEED -- BUT DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE THAT SEEING NONE. SOME OF OUR PRO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU I JUST -- AS WE SAID THIS BILL IS A SIGN FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR AGES SAYS JUST A LITTLE ABOUT IT. AND WE FEEL COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS GOES A LONG WAY IF THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO GO INTO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE GOING MEDI CAL IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE BIGGER EXPENSE FOR THE STATE. AND I JUST ASK FOR SUPPORT WHEN IT COMES FOR VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK. WE ARE ADJOURNED. A GOOD JOB. FOR THREE YEARS LAWLER
