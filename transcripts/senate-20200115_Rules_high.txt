THANK YOU A CHAIR ATKINS AND SENATORS- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO APPEAR TODAY I WANTED TO START BY THINKING I'LL GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR APPOINTING ME- AND ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES KELLY CHARTS EVERYONE KNOWS THAT- I ALSO- WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THANK- THE STAFF AT KELLY CHAR SOME OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY WITH ME AND- OTHERS WHO ARE WATCHING BACK AT THE OFFICE- WITHOUT. THEIR SUPPORT BOTH FOR ME AND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OR IN THE TRANSITION I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY TO HAVE ANY OUR SUCCESSES TO REPORT TO YOU. I STARTED THE POSITION IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN- HAVING HAD A BIT OF TIME TO REFLECT ON ON THE TIME AND PHYSICIAN IT'S- IT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR ME TO HAVE BEEN AND BE ABLE TO TALK TO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- WHEN I STARTED. THERE WERE- MANY THINGS TO JUMP RIGHT INTO WE HAD- SIX CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND ONE THAT WAS EXPIRED FROM A PREVIOUS YEAR- THERE WAS ALSO EIGHTY. MOST OF THE CHIEF NEGOTIATORS THAT WE HAVE A COUCH ARE WERE VACANT AT THAT TIME SO THOSE ARE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES WHO SERVE AS THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR- AT THE BARGAINING TABLES AND WE HAD TO FILL ALL THOSE POSITIONS SO WE JUMPED RIGHT IN. OF FILLING THOSE POSITIONS AND- GETTING THE CONTRACT. DISCUSSIONS GOING AND- HAPPY TO REPORT THAT BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD SEVEN CONTRACTS- INCLUDING THE SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND CONTRACT THE COVERS NINE BARGAINING UNITS AND SO- YOU SAW MANY OF THOSE. OUT LAST YEAR TO RATIFY BEFORE YOU ADJOURN AND- WE CONCLUDED ONE AT THE VERY END OF THE YEAR IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO MISSING THAT ONE SHORTLY- THE WORK IS CERTAINLY NOT DONE WE HAVE SEVEN MORE TO NEGOTIATE IN TWENTY TWENTY SO THAT IS A- BIG PART OF WHAT GOES ON IN CALLIE CHAR. AN ARM CRTAINLY OF A ONE OF THE MOST KIND OF ENERGIZING PARTS OF THE JOB IS FOLLOWING UP ON THOSE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS- ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I. THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HIGHLIGHT IS. IN SEPTEMBER GOVERNOR NEW SOME CONVENIENCE- A GROUP OF AGENCIES FOR TERRY'S THE UNDERSECRETARIES THE DIRECTORS OF EACH OF THE DEPARTMENT. OF THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR A- FIRST OF ITS KIND FORUM ON- DISCUSSING THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITY FOR CREATING A MORE INCLUSIVE. A DIVERSE RESPECTFUL AN EQUITABLE WORKPLACE FOR STATE EMPLOYEES. AND I WAS HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT EFFORT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OPERATES THE AGENCY AND THE STATE. BOARD OF AN AND ALL OF OUR STAFF ACCOUNT ARE WE MADE IT AND FOR THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED AND FROM THAT DISCUSSION- SEVERAL PAST. IS WERE CREATED- ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PAY EQUITY ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRADING IN RESPONSE AND ALSO A OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMPONENT WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT DIVERSITY. AND HIRING EFFORTS JUST IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY CLASSIFICATION. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE EXPECTED TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR IN JULY- IT'S AN EFFORT THAT. INCLUDING THE TASK FORCE MEMBERS OF THE SUBGROUP BIRDS THERE DOZENS OF STATE LEADERS WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AND I'M I'M VERY EXCITED BY THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED SO FAR AND I THINK IT'S A REAL- OPPORTUNITYTO MAKE. A DIFFERENCE IN SOME AREAS THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR STATE SERVICE FOR DECADES REALLY. SO WITH THAT I WILL- AND MY REMARKS AND I'LL TAKE ANY COPY TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU I'M I THINK I MIGHT LEAD OFF WITH ONE QUESTION GIVEN. WHAT THE RULES COMMITTEE IS HAD TO. WORK ON THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- GALLO HR PROCURED- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IT SYSTEM TO TRACK SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS JUDGEMENTS SETTLEMENTS- WITH THE DATABASE EXPECTED TO BE UP AND RUNNING THIS MONTH. I WOULD ASK WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS OF IMPLEMENTING THE NEW IT SYSTEM. TO TRACK SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS JUDGEMENTS SETTLEMENTS- IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF OPEN WITH THAT AND DO YOU EXPECT CAL HR TO UTILIZE THE DATA. COLLECTED BY THE NEW TRACK. EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO- YES STARTING UNDER- THE GOVERNOR BROWN'S- PROPOSAL TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT WOULD TRACK THESE- THE CASES FILED TO- IO OFFICERS WITHIN STATE DEPARTMENTS. OF THAT SYSTEM WAS- PLANT FUNDED IN PLANS PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL AT KELLY CHAR BUT I'M I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT IT WENT LIVE ON A JANUARY ONE. SO BEGINNING WITH ANY- CASES THAT ARE FILED- WITHIN A DEPARTMENT EIGHT DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT- ANY KIND OF COMPLAINT. THAT FALLS INTO THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CATEGORY OF A- CUP. FOR PROTECTED CLASS ANY OF THOSE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM OF THE SYSTEM FOLLOWS THAT COMPLAINT FOR THE LIFE OF THE COMPLAINT THE- THE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM IS VERY LIMITED WITHIN A DEPARTMENT SO DEPARTMENTS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY OFFICER. THEIR INVESTIGATOR AND THOSE APPS MANAGERS ARE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM THE- INFORMATION ABOUT. WHEN THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED WHETHER THE SUB THE- COMPLAINT TO SUBSTANTIATED OR NOT IF IT IS SUBSTANTIATED IT'LL TRACK THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THE CASES- IF THERE ARE. LEGAL ACTION. ON THAT RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS IT WILL TRACK THAT INFORMATION ALTHOUGH WE WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT WOULD BE- SOMETIME THE FUTURE THAT WE WOULD SEE THAT TYPE OF THE NATION BECAUSE THAT THE CASE IS BEING FILED OUR CASES FILED JANUARY ONE OR LATER. SO IT IS A LOT WE HAVE A I KNOW. SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS HAVE ACCESS IT SINCE JANUARY ONE. AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE I TURN OVER. OUR THERE'S A NEW LEGISLATION TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO EXPAND- SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING TO NOT JUST MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS BUT TO ALL EMPLOYEES. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW THAT. HOW THAT'S GO AND WHAT'S CAL HR'S ROLE. IN THAT. OR SO- THE- THE ORIGINAL BILL REQUIRED THAT THAT TRAINING BE DONE BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR SOME DID SIGN A BILL TO PUSH THAT DEADLINE OUT UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE DO KNOW THAT- MANY DEPARTMENTS WERE ALREADY TRACK TO HAVE THEIR EMPLOYEES TRAINED THE END OF. NINETEEN SO I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE HAVE ALREADY DONE TRAINING ALSO THERE WERE- THEY WERE DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE ALREADY TRAINING ALL EMPLOYEES AND NOT JUST THE SUPERVISORS- CALLIE CHARS ROLE IN THAT IS MORE IN A OF MONITORING AND- OVERSIGHT ROLE WE- WE DO OFFER THE TRAINING CLASSES. IN AS PART OF OUR MANAGEMENT TRAINING AND THAT IT AS PART OUR TRAINING PROGRAM OVER ALL THOSE CLASSES ARE AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO ENROLL IN. I WOULD SAY TYPICALLY DEPARTMENTS TAKE THE LEAD ON TRAINING FOR ONLY PLEASE AND NOT CAN HANDLE IN ANY. WAYS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO TRY TO MAKE SURE. THIS TRAIN- THING TO MENTION IS GOVERNOR KNEW SOME VERY CLEAR AT THAT FORUM EVENT WITH ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP AND IN OTHER COMMUNICATIONS. EXPECTATION HIS. THING PARTMINER ACCOUNT FOR MAKE SURE THAT. SHE WILL COME ANSWER THIS TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND SO WHAT THE SUBGROUPS OF THE TASK FORCE THAT I MENTIONED IS LOOKING AT COMPLIANCE TOOLS WHAT ARE SOME THINGS WE COULD DO TO HELP DEPARTMENTS A TRACK. COMPLIANCE SOME OF THE LARGE DEPARTMENTS- HAVE. LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WHERE THEY'RE BETTER ABLE TO AUTOMATE TRACKING BUT I KNOW OFFERED FOR CALLIE CHAR WE HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WE'RE TRACKING NOT ON AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET. SPREADSHEET AND SO. ON THERE ARE TOOLS OUT THERE THAT DO A REMINDERS AND KIND OF HAVE. MORE OF A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THOSE DEADLINES ARE BAD AND WHEN PEOPLE CYCLE IN TRAINING COMES UP THAT THEY ARE AGAIN BEING TRAINED ON CYCLE. THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE EXPECT TO BRING FORWARD IN JULY. THANK YOU. I SENATOR ROTH CANISTER IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THANK YOU AMEND PRO TEM. CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS JOB. HAS TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT JOB GIVEN THE. OF SCOPE AND BREADTH OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT- THERE WE HAVE WORKING DILIGENTLY FOR THE STATE. JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE. YOU KNOW IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OVER THE YEARS THE THERE'S BEEN A TUG BETWEEN- MANAGEMENT AND H. R. AS TO WHO ACTUALLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AS MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN IN THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS AND WHO ACTUALLY- HAS THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN DISAPPOINTING TERMINATION AND PROCESSING OF COMPLAINTS IN. THE HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONALS OVER THE YEARS HAVE FOUGHT TO RETAIN HIS SEAT AT THE TABLE IN FACT HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT SEAT AT THE TABLE AND I THINK LARGELY BY AND LARGE THEY'VE WON THAT BATTLE AND H. R. PROFESSIONALS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN INITIAL DECISION MAKING ON EVALUATION OF COMPLAINTS IN. THIS ONE IN THE NATION THE CIVIC. IN THIS STATE IN A SERIES OF NEWS ARTICLES I KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTED THEM. HAVING TO DO WITH THE ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION- IN PROMOTION PRACTICES IN ACTIONS WITHIN. DEPARTMENTS THE HANDLING OR IGNORING OF THE EEO COMPLAINTS- THE DENIAL OF ACCOMMODATION REQUESTS FOR THOSE WITH. DISABILITIES AND MY QUESTION IS THIS I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE EFFORTS ON IT. THE EFFORTS ON COMPLAINT TRACKING. BUT HOW DO WE STRENGTHEN THE COMMAND IN QUALITY CONTROL FUNCTION- OVER HR DECISION MAKING. AN AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS OF CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT VIS A VIS THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES BETTER FOR QUESTION IS IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION BUT IT'S FAIR LET ME LET ME. BECAUSE WHAT I'VE SEEN AND OBSERVED IS WE HAVE LOWER LEVEL OF EMPLOYEES WHO OFTENTIMES OR THE- OR THE SCREENING DEVICE FOR AEO COMPLAINTS WE HAVE SUPERVISORS WHO PERHAPS. MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED BUT MAYBE NOT ENOUGH WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ON ISSUES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL OF LIABILITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU CAN TRACK THOSE THINGS BUT YOUR PEOPLE ARE NOT IN THE DECISION MAKING EQUATION AND SO THERE'S NO WAY TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE LIABILITY THAT'S WHERE I'M GETTING. TO WITH MY QUESTION. SO I THINK A ONE THING THAT MAKES THAT DIFFICULT IN THE STATE STRUCTURE IS THAT CALIFORNIE H. R. PROFESSIONALS FOR EACH DEPARTMENT EACH DEPARTMENT IS DELEGATED THE AUTHORITY TO DO ERROR OF HIRING AND- PERSONAL TRANSACTIONS A LOT OF WHAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THE HR IS. OCCURRING IN THE DEPARTMENTS CAPTION OURS ROLE IS ON THE SITE AND ACCOUNTABILITY- KELLY CHAR IS VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN ENFORCING THE RULES THERE ARE A LOT OF A RULES AND STRUCTURES WITHIN CITY SERVICES YOU WILL KNOW- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ON- THE COMPLEX FUNCTIONS THEY HAVE A COMPLIANCE REVIEW UNIT THAT. VIEWS OF WHETHER THE DEPARTMENTS ARE AT HEARING TO THE STATE'S POLICIES- AND THEN. SAID THAT THEY ARE NOT WILL BE ALONG WITH THE STATE PERSONAL BOARD WILL WORK TO INTERVENE INCLUDING THOSE DELEGATIONS CAN BE. TAKEN OKAY SO AND WE HAVE WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF THAT SO SOME OF THE EXAMPLES WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IN THE NEWSPAPER RESULTS OF THOSE ISSUES IS THERE DELEGATION IS REMOVED AND WAS- HIRING DECISIONS AND THINGS THAT. WERE NOT. BEING PROPERLY THEN. MADE THOSE DECISIONS MADE BY. AFTER THE TICKET ESTHER FEE. THAT THAT IS SO LET ME JUST- SO DID THE HR PROFESSIONALS IN AGENTS OR DEPARTMENTS WORK FOR YOU KNOW THEY REPORT TO THE AGENCY HAD OR A SUPERVISOR UNDERNEATH THE AGENCY HAS SO THAT'S THE DICHOTOMY IN THE ISSUE THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOTTED LINE RESPONSIBILITY IS A FOUR AS OPPOSED TO SELL IN LINE SUPERVISION. AND RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN ADDED DISCUSSION OF SHIFTING THE WAY HR PROFESSIONALS CERTAINLY THE HR MANAGERS IN AN AGENCY. THEY WERE DISCUSSION HAVING THOSE INDIVIDUALS REPORT DIRECTLY TO CAL HR AND TAKE THEM OUT FROM UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF AGENCY HEADS AND SUPERVISORS PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE OF FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES TO THE STATE SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS I THINK AS IT RELATES TO MOST HR FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND THE COMPLEXITY OF- THE OPERATIONS OF THOSE STATE DEPARTMENT SO AS I THINK ABOUT WHAT MY JOB IS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR FOLKS HAVE I THINK IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE TAKING OVER. ALL OF THE HIRING FOR A DIP IN THE COUNTER AT THE LARGE. HAVE THEIR OWN. LAW PERSONAL SHOPPER WELL I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THERE A WAY FOR AN HR PROFESSIONAL EMBEDDED IN THE- TICKET AGENCY CALTRANS. TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY TO YOU. OR TO YOUR SUBORDINATES IF THERE'S AN ISSUE OR SITUATION GOING ON IN A PROTECTED WAY SO THAT WE KNOW AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL INSIDE THE H. R. HIERARCHY IT'S SOMETHING IS AMISS. IN CALTRANS OR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OR PICK AN AGENCY SO I DO THINK THAT THIS DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT TRACKING SYSTEM AND POLICY THAT IS NEW FOR TWENTY TWENTY GETS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE DOTTED LINE QUESTION THAT YOU MENTION- WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN ROLLING OUT THE SYSTEM AND IN- DOING THE TRAINING ON WHO'S ALLOWED TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM AND WHAT INFORMATION HAS TO BE ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE UNCOVERED A THREE IS WHERE- DEPARTMENTS- PERHAPS DID NOT HAVE THAT- EEO OFFICER REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE DIRECTOR AS THEIR REQUIRED TO EITHER IN THERE OR GET FOR CHART OR IN IN PRACTICE THE ISSUES WERE BEING RATE FRANKLY TO THE DIRECTOR. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM ALLOWED US TO- ADDRESS THOSE ANOMALIES AND ALSO THEIR ABILITY TO ENTER AND THE CASE IS THE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE COMPLAINT IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM. THERE. WHICH MEANT THEY GO AND THEY HELLO THE DESTINATION REPORT AND THE WHAT THE- ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS OF THAT CASE. IT DOES GIVE CALLIE CHAR I THINK MORE WINDOW INTO THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES ON WHAT ARE HAPPENING AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL THAN BEFORE AND THAT WAS THE INTENTION WAS TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT. OVER DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS- I DO AT THIS MOMENT I DON'T THINK WE'VE CONTEMPLATED TAKING THAT BEYOND HE EEO COMPLAINTS BUT IT MAY BE A MODEL FOR HOW WE WOULD HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT OVER OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES THAT- PUT THE DEPARTMENTS AT RISK. WELL NOT TO BELABOR THIS BUT I WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TO. THINK ABOUT WHETHER WE COULD FURTHER PROFESSIONAL LIFE THE H. R. CADRE AND STATE GOVERNMENT- CREATING A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T REMOVE THE- THE- THE CONTRIBUTION IN THE WORKS OF THE HR PROFESSIONAL DOES INSIDE OF AN AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT WE DON'T TAKE THE- HR. PROFESSIONAL OUTSIDE OF THE SUPERVISION OF THE AGENCY SECRETARY FOR EXAMPLE BUT WE CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT AND A AND A FORMAL PROCESS WHERE. BOTH THE SECRETARY FOR EXAMPLE. AND CAL H. R. AND THE HR PROFESSIONAL KNOW THAT THE PROFESSIONAL CAN GO DIRECTLY TO CAL HR WITH ANYTHING OF ANY CONCERN OR IF THERE IS A PROCESS IT. SEEMS RIGHT. IN A VERY PROTECTIVE CASE THAT WE HAVE SOME ABILITY YOUR PROCEDURAL. BEFORE COME CAN AFFECT REMOTE. THE HIGHER IN HR THIRTY FROM A TICKET OR THE OF A OR AN AGENCY INC AND- GIVE IT TO YOU. THERE MAY BE A WAY TO DO THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M SMART ENOUGH. ABOUT IT BUT I KNOW OUR- CAN I. WORKING ON THE- MATTER. TAKE WHAT OTHERS ON THE NET QUESTION. TO DO COMPANIES IN STUDIES. THAT TENDS TO COME UP AROUND HERE EVERY TIME WERE ASKED TO APPROVE A ONE MO YOU OR ANOTHER- WHAT ROLE DO YOU SEE. AND WHAT UTILITY DO YOU SEE AN COMPENSATION STUDIES AND IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NEGOTIATION AND IN SETTING THE PAY SCALES FOR OUR WORKERS WHO WORK. DILIGENTLY FOR STATE GOVERNMENT. THAT SAID A TIMELY QUESTION AS WE HAVE JUST RELEASED COMPENSATION STUDIES- IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY FOR THE NEXT- ROUNDS OF A BARGAINING UNIT- CONTRACTS THAT ARE EXPIRING AT AS I SEE IN MY REVIEW OF THE CAN THIS MY FIRST TIME FR GOING THROUGH REVIEWING THE COMPENSATION STUDIES IN ADVANCE OF BARGAINING. I SEE THEM AS- PROVIDING- THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MARKET PLACE AND GIVING US THE INFORMATION TO ASSESS THE TYPES OF REQUESTS THAT COME IN FROM THE DEPARTMENTS AND FROM THE LABOR REPRESENTATIVE SO WHEN WE ARE PREPARING FOR BARGAINING WE'RE HEARING FROM DEPARTMENTS ABOUT EACH POSITIONS THEY'RE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FILLING- WHERE THEY'RE SEEING A LOT OF TURNOVER- WE HAVE THAT BACK AND FORTH WITH DEPARTMENTS AND WORK THROUGH- OKAY IS IT. IS THE SYSTEM A LONG TERM PROBLEM IT'S A SHORT PROBLEM AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THAT. A GROUP OF- JOBS COMPARES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES YOU IT'S AT LEAST A CHECK ON OKAY DOES IS THE SOUNDING RIGHT IS THIS MAKING SENSE THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO INVEST IN. WHETHER IT'S A- YOU KNOW PAY DIFFERENTIAL OF SOME SORT OR JUST INCREASING COMPENSATION FOR THAT PARTICULAR CLASSIFICATION WE DID A LOT OF THAT TYPE OF WORK IN THE LAST ROUND OF CONTRACTS WHERE WE HAVE. RESOURCES CHEN C. TWO KILLER NUMER POSITIONS WITH THE V. D. RATES WERE TWENTY TWENTY FIRST. THE PAY HAD JUST REALLY NOT KEPT UP WITH WHAT LOCAL AGENCIES ARE PAYING FOR THOSE EXACT OF JOBS AND- WE MADE THOSE ADJUST. AND THAT IS VERY MUCH BUT OUR. IT'S WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO BEING AS PART OF A THING AND WE'VE KIND OF THE PROCESS AROUND THAT WHICH IS. PROBLEMS ARE WE SOLVING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE ITS DATA LABOR TO PROVIDE A STATE A AND REALLY- HELP THE DEPARTMENTS BE ABLE TO FILL THE POSITION SO THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON THE PROGRAMMATIC WORK. AND I THINK THE SALARIES THE SALARY AND COMPENSATION SURVEYS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY PROVIDE US IS THAT BACK UP DATA TO. TO COMPARE TO WHAT WE'RE BEING REQUESTED WHO SETS THE COMPARABLES IN THE COMPENSATION STUDY. I'M I BELIEVE WE DO I AM I'M IF I'M WRONG I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON A CLARIFICATION BUT I BELIEVE WE DO. THAT'S I'M JUST CURIOUS AND YOU COULDN'T PROVE IT BY MAYES SO THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. WITH RESPECT TO COMPENSATION STUDIES THAN. WHICH SHOULD WE EVER BE FACED WITH A. SOMETHING OTHER THAN A COST OF LIVING INCREASE IN A AND M. O. U. WITHOUT A COMPENSATION STUDY TO BACK UP THE INCREASE. I MEAN I THINK THAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT METHODOLOGIES OR- WHETHER- PAST STUDIES WERE. REALLY REPRESENTING THE TYPE OF A CLASSIFICATION IS I THINK THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED. IN CASES WHERE THE CLASSIFICATION IS VERY UNIQUE TO STATE SERVICE AND THERE REALLY- IT'S MUCH HARDER TO FIND TRUE COMPARABLES- I THINK THAT NOT. NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE PAST I WOULD LIKE TO- HAVE A PROCESS WHERE WE DON'T EVER ASK YOU TO DO THAT WERE YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT DATA. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD SAY THERE MIGHT BE TIMES WHERE THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER DATA SETS THAT WE LOOK AT AND THERE ARE OTHER JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WHAT WE BRING TO THE LEGISLATURE TO RATIFY AND- THERE IS- WE WANT TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE ABOUT WHAT THAT IS SO IF IT ISN'T A SALARY SURVEY THAT. RESULTED IN A PARTICULAR A PAY INCREASE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO THROUGH ALL THE REASONS WHY WE AGE DO WE REACH THAT CONCLUSION. WELL I WANT TO AGAIN SAY CONGRATULATIONS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE QUALITY OF YOUR RESPONSES AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- CONTINUED SERVICE. TO THE STATE YOUR RECORD IS IMPECCABLE AND I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THE MOTION TO CONFIRM IN VOTING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. SENATOR ROTH MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CONGRATULATIONS LOOKING FORWARD TO- SUPPORTING YOUR NOMINATION THIS YOUR IN YOUR LAST POSITION AS I G. FOR SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO I WAS WONDERING WHY THE JOB AND THEN AFTER HEARING THIS CONVERSATION HOW SIMILAR IS THE- THE IG POSITION WITH CALTRANS TO DEALING WITH ALL THESE OTHER AGENCIES IN ALL THEIR- ACT HR ISSUES. TOM SO- YES I WAS IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND MOST OF YOU WERE HERE AND VERY KIND TO CONFIRM YOU FOR THAT ROLE OF PREVIOUSLY I THINK- YOU KNOW AS AS I REFLECTED ON THIS OPPORTUNITY COMING UP AND LEAVING THAT POSITION EARLY IT WAS A TERM TO POSITION AND I- I HAD TO. DECIDE WHETHER THAT MADE SENSE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I STRONGLY. POSITION AND FOCUSED. THERE WAS REALLY ESTABLISHING THE INDEPENDENCE OF TH OFFICE AND HOW IT MIGHT OPERATE WITH THE AGENCY SECRETARY THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR. BUT WHAT I FELT STRONGLY WAS THAT THE- THE- FOR THAT FONG THAT OUR OFFICE TO FUNCTION WELL IS TO HAVE A REALLY STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE FOLKS. AND SENSE AT THAT POINT I HAD A STRONG SENSE THAT THOSE WERE GOING TO BE ALL NEW PEOPLE. IT MADE SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME TO LEAVE A TIME TO SELECT ALL OF THOSE NEW PEOPLE FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK. WHAT IT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO ME TO BE IN A LARGE DEPARTMENT EVEN FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND SEE THE- IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO HIRE. PEOPLE OR- SOME OF THAT PROCESSES. TO IS TO BE IN A LARGE DEPARTMENT AND JUST KIND OF SEE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAUSE THE TIME TO STRETCH IT WAS VERY HELPFUL- I DON'T THINK. I'D I NEVER I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING IN THAT DEPARTMENT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE I THINK EVERYONE IS STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO ATTRACT THE BEST CANDIDATES AND GET THE ONES THAT ARE THE BEST IN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOSING THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE- A LOT OF. THE STEAM IT WAS COMING UP IN MANY CLASSIFICATIONS ACROSS MANY DEPARTMENTS WHICH IS LOCAL AGENCIES ARE PAYING MUCH MORE THAN THE STATE FOR MANY OF OUR JOBS- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I'D- I THINK EVERY STATE DEPARTMENT IS FACING AN- AND- THAT. MY EXPERIENCE THERE AS WELL. THE SELECTION. YEAH A SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO ADD MY CONGRATULATIONS I APPRECIATED THE TIME WE HAD TO REVIEW MANY OF THESE ISSUES IN MY OFFICE EARLIER TODAY I DO WANT TO RETURN TO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE PRO TEM ASKED ABOUT SPECIFICALLY AROUND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING THERE WERE MEDIA REPORTS INDICATING THAT AS MANY AS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SUPERSTORE ILL. NOW IN CALIFORNIA HAD NOT RECEIVED THE TRAINING CAN YOU GIVE US A PROGRESS REPORT ON THAT AND WHAT STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN. TO ASSURE THE PEOPLE IN PARTICULARLY IN SUPERVISORIAL POSITIONS I KNOW THAT WE ALSO NOW REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES BUT- FOR SUPERVISORS AGAIN TO PROTECT AGAINST STATE LIABILITY. THAT TRAINING SEEMS IMPERATIVE SO I DO- THERE WERE MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT- AUDITS THAT HAD OCCURRED I THINK THAT INFORMATION CAME OUT RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THAT I WAS COMING ON BOARD I'D I DO BELIEVE THAT AND FOLLOW UP- REVIEWS OF THE DATA- THE GAP BETWEEN WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED AND NOT TRAINED. WAS WAS SMALLER THAN ORIGINALLY REPORTED AND LARGELY HAD TO DO WITH- HOW WHAT PEOPLE WERE RESERVE REPORTING AS NON COMPLIANCE- I KNOW SPEAKING FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE DEPARTMENT. IF WE HAD EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ON MEDICAL LEAVE FOR FAMILY LEAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT IF THE TIME OF WHICH IS THE WINNER OF THEIR TRAINING COMES UP DURING THE TIME THAT SOMEONE ASKS YOU. IS EVERYBODY TRAINED YOU WOULD SHOW THEM IS NOT TRAINED BUT THEY'RE NOT LIKELY WORK IN YOUR OFFICE AT THAT TIME AND THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE AS SOON AS A RETURN TO WORK THAT TO PRIORITY TO GET THEM. BACK ON THEIR THINGS GOT. SO I SAID THE- WORDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT BEEN TRAINED AND THEN- DID HOWEVER IT WAS STILL NOT AT FULL COMPLIANCE AD I THINK THAT- THAT WAS A LARGE PART OF. A MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR WANTED TO. THAT ALL. DEPARTMENT YOUR SHIP THAT WAS HOW IMPORTANT IS TO ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL COMPLY. HOW CRITICAL IT TO THE- TO NOT ONLY CREATE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE WANT TO CREATE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND PROTECTING THEM BUT ALSO TO CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT WE WANT SO THAT PEOPLE WANT TO COME WORK HERE SO THE NEW PEOPLE THINK OF US AS THE EMPLOYER OF CHOICE AND WANT TO BE WORK. STATES THAT TOPIC IS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF ISSUES ONE BEING HOW WE DELIVER THE TRAINING ARE THERE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAYS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS TRAINED- THEY ARE LOOKING AT- COMPLIANCE TOOLS AS WERE CALLING THEM AND I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT TRACKING SYSTEM WILL HELP US IN- SEEING TRENDS IN HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COME VESTED ASIAN OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES TOOLS LIKE THAT. ALSO THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO GO DOWN THINGS THAT THAT REMIND. EDITORS AND SUPERVISORS THAT THERE THE INSUBORDINATE MANAGING SURPRISED HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINED- YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT IT IN MOST DEPARTMENTS IF YOU YOU GET THE AND YOU PROBABLY GET THIS TO WE GET THE NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE TO RESET YOUR PASSWORD AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WHEN YOU'RE A NEW EMPLOYEE IF YOU DON'T DO YOUR CYBERSECURITY TRAINING YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD TO BE AT THE A YOUR PERMANENT PASSWORD AND SO. THEY'RE CON KIND OF TICKLER THAT YOU NEED TO GET THAT DONE BUT THE TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS A SYSTEM THAT DOES THAT ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT WELL ON THAT MEETING. A GOOD TECHNIQUE YES THAT BE EMPLOYED. AS HAVING THE PASSWORD GO THROUGH THAT CHECKLIST OF THE REQUIRED TRAININGS. ROM NOT JUST THE SEX HARASSMENT PREVENTION BUT OTHER MEN'S IN ON THAT POINT. WHAT'S THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR OFFICE STATE HR IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS WHAT'S YOUR OVERSIGHT OR ABILITY TO. ENFORCE THAT COMPLIANCE SIR REVIEW AND ENFORCE COMPLIANCE I THINK- TO DATE TO THE COMPLIANCE ON THAT PARTICULAR TRAINING HASN'T REALLY COME THROUGH THE AGENCY LEVEL RATHER THAN THROUGH CALLIE CHAR. I WOULD SAY THAT KELLY CHARTERS ROLE IN IN THE OVERSIGHT OF THAT- WOULD COME INTO PLAY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT- WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE OR SEEM TO HAVE SOME- REAL BARRIER TO FOLLOWING THE STATE POLICY THAT MAY PLAY INTO HAVING THEIR DELEGATION REMOVED IN WHICH CASE MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE MORE OF A ROLE OF- INSURING THAT TRAINING. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE LIKE I IS A DEPARTMENT RESPONDING TO THE SECRETARY. SORT OF FOLLOW HIS EVERYBODY BRIAN WELL IN HIS CAN YOU MENTION THE- SENATE ON AN EXPECTATION SO YOU'RE GOING THAT IS WELL. I THINK AS PART OF. CREATING THE CULTURE WE WANT IT HAS TO BE NOT. A SUBSIDIARY ISSUE THAT WE GET TO BED BUT OF PARAMOUNT ONE ARM WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU WE DID DISCUSS SOME OF THE OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE SUCCESSION PAY EQUITY DIVERSITY AND- I WAS- ENCOURAGED BY BOTH YOUR KNOWLEDGE XIN APPROACH TO THOSE SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MADAM PO TEMP THANK YOU SENATOR LET ME ASK NOW FOR- MINT. YES ABSOLUTELY SENATOR. JUST OF JUST A FOLLOW UP ON MY ORIGINAL POINT HAVING TO DO WITH CHAIN OF COMMAND AND CONTROL AND QUALITY CONTROL. JUST TO GET AN IDEA I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE STATE IS STRUCTURED IN THE HR. ARENA THESE DAYS BUT HOW MANY SENIOR HR MANAGERS OR DIRECTORS ARE THERE. FOLKS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT HR FUNCTIONS IN STATE GOVERNMENT. IS AT A HUNDRED WELL AT I WOULD SAY. I THINK EVERY DEPARTMENT OF- CONSEQUENTIAL SIZE SO THERE ARE A FEW DEPARTMENTS AND BOARDS THE OUTER THE HAVE VERY VERY TINY STAFF AND THEY MAYBE HAVE THEIR AGENCY HELPING THEM WITH HR BUT ANY DEPARTMENT OF SIZE WOULD HAVE AN HR DIRECTOR- I THINK THAT'S PRETTY CALMLY FIELD POSITION ON THAT PERSON MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPORTING TO A KIND OF AN ADMIN CHIEF- WHO WOULD ALSO HAVE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN H. R. ISSUES AND THEN UNDERNEATH THE- HR DIRECTOR THERE WOULD LIKELY BE- PEOPLE AT THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT LEVEL WHO HAVE. A DIFFERENT KIND OF CATEGORY OF AREAS THEY MIGHT RESPOND FOR THE E. MIGHT BE ONE. HIRING MIGHT BE ANOTHER PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT ANOTHER SO I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER WE CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBERS BUT- I THINK. IN ORDER FOR A STATE SERVICE TO FUNCTION THE WAY IT FUNCTIONS TODAY WITH THE LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY THE CIVIL SERVICE RULES- EACH DEPARTMENT REALLY HAS A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL HR FUNCTION. INTERNALLY MY CONCERN MY CONCERN IS STANDARDIZED QUALITY. AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THEIR WIDE VARIATIONS OF QUALITY EVEN AMONG THE LARGER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY AND SOMEHOW. WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN AN EARLIER POINT THAN WE ARE CURRENTLY AIMING TOWARD WHICH IS TRACKING AND CATCHING THE STUFF AT THE BACKEND WE NEED TO ENGAGE AT THE FRONT END WE NEED TO GET A BETTER DEAL ON STANDARD. SURE QUALITY AND CAN- IN OUR SYSTEM. AND I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ANSWER FOR THAT BUT- JUST TO REITERATE MY EARLIER POINT A LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET A HANDLE- AND WITH CAL HR IS THE BIG HR DEPARTMENT HAVING SOME CONTROL OVER WHAT H. R. PROFESSIONALS ARE DOING DOWN IN THE BELLS OF THESE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE I'M- I FEAR THAT. WE DON'T KNOW. AND WE DON'T KNOW UNTIL WE GET A COMPLAINT. OR WORSE A PIECE OF CIVIL LITIGATION WHERE WE FIND OUT WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR IT'S BAD. AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU EGGMAN. THANK YOU I THINK WHAT I WANTED TO- IS GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT BUT RECOGNIZE THAT US SENATOR BATES HAS JOINED IS NOT ASK HER PUT HER ON THE SPOT RIGHT NOW SHE WILL HAVE THOMAS SHE WANTS TO RE DIRECT AND ASK A QUESTION OR COMMENT IF THAT'S OKAY. SO SHE CAN. GET AROUND. SO WITH THAT LET ME I ASK THOSE WHO WANT TO COME FORWARD AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT. GIVE ME YOUR NAME WHO YOU REPRESENT AND THE- VERY SHORT WHAT YOU THINK. EIGHTY PARRIS OF SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTING STATE EMPLOYEES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT ALL.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I WILL TRY TO BE EXTREMELY SHORT I'M WITH MY OPENING REMARKS I'M SO HONORED TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU ALL TODAY- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THE FIRST- HAVING SERVED FOR JUST ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS. ON THE CALIFORNIA. ON THIS BOARD- HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT HONORS OF MY LIFE- FOR MANY REASONS AND THE MAIN ONE BEING- I'M A MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN WHO MY CHILDREN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY ONE YOU SAW AT THE LAST CONFIRMATION HEARING SHE WAS JUST ABOUT DONE WITH HER TIME AT UC DAVIS AND THIS WEEK SHE HAS LAW SCHOOL INTERVIEWS AND SO AS A SINGLE MOTHER WHO'S RAISED HER I'M SO PROUD. MY EIGHT YEAR OLD. IS DELIVERING HER I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH TODAY IT IS MORE OF THE KING'S BIRTHDAY SO THEY BOTH COULD BE HERE. WITH ME TODAY BUT I CAN'T READ- SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH BTH AS A SINGLE AND WIDOWED MOTHER. AND MOVING MY CHILDREN TO EDUCATION. THE SECOND REASON WHY I'M HONORED TO BE HERE. IS BECAUSE FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS. WHO ATTEND THE CSU- I'D DEEPLY DEEPLY BELIEVE THAT THEY DESERVE A CONSISTENT UNBRIDLED VOICE X. SPECIALLY. FROM SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO TO BE TWELVE YEARS TO MOVE THROUGH UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION. EDUCATION IS NOT ONLY A PRIVILEGE AS YOU WELL KNOW IT'S A HUMAN RIGHT AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A SIGNIFICANT AN AMAZING JOB AT PROVIDING ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO MORE SO MY- WILLINGNESS TO SERVE IN THE- GOVERNOR HIMSELF KNOWS THAT THROUGHOUT MY TWENTY PLUS YEARS OF ACTIVISM AND ORGANIZING IN THE STATE ON BEHALF OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN. I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST GETTING STARTED IN PUBLIC SERVICE TO ME NOT ONLY AS AN HONOR. IT'S MY OBLIGATION AND SO I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M- WILLING AND READY AND ANXIOUS TO HEAR YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH- LET ME START WITH SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WELCOME CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- COMMITMENT TO CONTINUED SERVICE NOT JUST IN THIS ROLE BUT IS I'VE LEARNED ON MANY OTHER FRANCIS WELL IN. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS OF YOUR CHILDREN THE SHARED WITH US. THEY'RE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. MY QUESTION WE HAD A NICE CONVERSATION YESTERDAY I WAS IMPRESSED WITH YOUR OVERALL KNOWLEDGE IN. SOME OF YOUR SENSE OF PRIORITIES FOR C. ISSUE FOR STUDENTS FOR STAFF FACULTY- I KNOW YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A REFINED POSITION ON THIS BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO HEAR SOME OF THE- PROS AND COS. LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSAL I UNDERSTAND TO ADD A FOURTH. YEAR HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENT FOR STUDENTS THAT WANT TO BE ADMITTED TO SEE ISSUE. IN SCIENCE FOR ANALYTICAL STUDIES. HOW ARE YOU APPROACHING THAT CLEARLY THE GOAL IS TO HAVE. MORE HIGHLY PREPARED STUDENTS COMING IN TO SEE ISSUE BUT IS THERE ANY DANGER OF STUDENTS BEING DENIED ACCESS BECAUSE OF LACK OF ACCESS TO THOSE PROGRAM SIR LACK OF APPROPRIATE COUNSELING FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS. SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND ALSO THE ANNOUNCES THAT YOU BROUGHT WITHIN THE QUESTION I'M CLEARLY THERE- THE QUEUE OUR PROPOSAL IS ONE THAT. I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE SENIOR MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF THE CHANCELLOR MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD. WHO HAVE EXPRESSED- THE NEED TO MOVE THIS PROPOSAL OF LONG. ARE ALL IN THE SAME THINKING THAT THE STUDENTS THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND EVEN RESUMING STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING INTO OUR UNIVERSITY- SHOULD. HAVE ALL THAT THEY NEED TO NOT ONLY PREPARE FOR A- CAREER IN STEM BUT REALLY TO CONFRONT THE SHIFTING TECHNOLOGICAL. INFRASTRUCTURE OF NOT ONLY OUR STATE BUT OUR COUNTRY. THE CHANCELLOR HIS SENIOR STAFF I'VE MET WITH THEM NUMEROUS TIMES I'VE HAD FORTY TWO CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ON THIS ISSUE. I THINK ALL OF US FOR FOLKS ARE PROPOSING. THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL THE FOLKS THAT ARE ASKING US TO HOLD UP WE'RE ALL CLEAR THAT STUDENTS IN THE STATE DESERVE EVERYTHING AND I THINK I SAID TO YOU I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO BE LIKE OUR NORWEGIAN COUNTERPARTS. ARE WE THERE YET I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND SO I'M CONFLICTED I HAVE TWO WEEKS BEFORE I DELIVER THIS VOTE- AT THAT DíAS. AND WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE MERITS IN THE VALUE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW WE MIGHT MOVE FORWARD SHOULD THE PROPOSAL MOVE FORWARD IN THE SEVEN YEARS. WILL BE ONE. WEATHER IS THE LEGISLATURE. WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIFTH GRADERS RIGHT NOW. WILL WE BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE OFFERINGS. NOT JUST IN OUR URBAN CENTERS. BUT IN OUR RULE CENTERS AS WELL OF. SO THAT'S ONE. AND IF MOVING FORWARD. NOT ONLY THE FISCAL IMPACT AS A QUESTION- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT MANY OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL HAVE SAID IS. ACCESS QUESTION IS IN BUT WE I WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND. THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS THE DISPARITY ANALYSIS THAT I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF COMMITTEE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDUCTED SO. MY THOUGHTS ARE- WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AGAIN WITH THE MEETINGS WITH THE CONVERSATIONS READING BOTH THE PROS AND CONS IS TO COME TO SOME CONCLUSION. ABOUT RESOURCES HOW WE MIGHT GET FAIR AND REALLY TO FOR MYSELF TO BE ABLE TO. HONESTLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION WILL WE BY MOVING FORWARD TONIGHT ACCESS TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ENTER OUR INSTITUTION I WISH I COULD SAY SENATORS THAT TODAY I WAS YES OR NO. BUT I GUARANTEE YOU. THE MORNING THAT I GO AND I INNER THAT VOTE- I WILL HAVE GOTTEN THE INFORMATION THAT I NEED TO BE ABLE TO. PROFOUNDLY AND SECURELY FEEL THAT I HAVE MADE THE VOTE THAT RESTS NOT ONLY ON MY CONSCIENCE BUT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PARENTS THAT I BELIEVE THAT I REPRESENT. AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT A AND I APPRECIATE THAT NISHINO FROM MY QUESTION. IN NO WAY DID I SEEK TO PUSH YOU FOR HOW YOU WOULD VOTE I KNOW THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE- INSTILLED GREAT CONFIDENCE IN APPROACH AND UNDERSTANDING. THE DIFFERENT VIEWS THAT ARE BEING VOICED SO I WISH YOU THE BEST IN REACHING THAT DECISION AND I'M CONFIDENT WHATEVER IT IS IT'LL BE WELL INFORMED AND- AS I HOPE WILL ALSO BE WITH THEIR- COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD. SO THANK YOU AND AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE MADAM PRO TEM I DON'T HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS THANKS TO HER THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU- MAN PROTIUM AND CONGRADULATIONS ON ASSIGNMENT I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR PASSION AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM YEAR A- YEAR ARE GONNA BE GREAT ON THE BOARD KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALREADY INVOLVED THAT TIME. THAT YOU ARE VERY VERY COMMITTED DATE SHE SAID IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. I THE CITY CLEAN CONCERNED AS YOU SHOULD BE SERVICES AND. IT WAS LATE OF. A AN AUDIT OF THE OVER THE UNIVERSITY YES SAN MARCOS SIDE TOUCHES MY DISTRICT. I AM VERY VERY CONCERNED OUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE VERY LAVISH EXPENSES THEY HAVE RATHER EXPENSIVE TASTES THAT'S RIGHT TALK ABOUT RESOURCES. THAT WE WANT TO SEE GOING TO OUR OUR STUDENTS AND THE- EDUCATIONAL. EXPERIENCE THAT THEY NEED THIS WAS PRETTY SHOCKING THAT'LL GIVE ME SOME THOUGHTS ON- YOUR APPROACH TO THIS ABSOLUTELY AND HAVE STANDARDS SO. WHERE YOU KNOW THE HOTELS THAT YOU CAN SELECT ARE NOT FIVE STAR PLUS DIAMOND RESORTS ON. THAT FEDERAL SO I SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT. YOU KNOW YOU YOU AND I ACTUALLY AGREE AS I A YOUNG PERSON I WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THEAGE OF NINETEEN AND HAD TWENTY EMPLOYEES I HAD NOT FINISHED COLLEGE- BUT ONE THING THAT I KNEW. IS THAT THE PUBLIC TRUST AND WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DESERVED EVERYTHING THAT EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND NOT ONLY NEEDED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BUT WE HAD TO MAKE REAL SERIOUS DECISIONS OF HOW WE SPEND THOSE MONIES. I TO APPALLED. APPALLED I READ ALL OF THE ARTICLES I SAW ALL THE CHARGES. AND HERE'S WHAT I'M. I'M PLEASED WITH WE HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT. FOR SAN MARCOS SAN MARCOS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I FEEL EXTREMELY CONFIDENT SPEAKING WITH OUR CHANCELLOR- IN OUR AUDITING STAFF THEY HAVE CLAMPED DOWN. IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REALLY ENCOURAGING- AND I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW HOW ARE SENIOR STAFF ARE SPENDING THEIR RESOURCES. IS THAT WHAT. WHEN YOU BUST OPEN THE WHOLE CHANGE AND NEW STANDARDS COME THROUGH- OUR NEW PRESIDENT IS AS A DEEP DEEP CONVICTION. THAT BECAUSE THE PUBLIC TRUST WAS LOST THAT. THE ROLE MOVING FORWARD IS TO GAIN IT BACK UP I THINK THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE CSU BOARD WORK TO APPALLED. BECAUSE EVERY TIME THAT WE ARE SPENDING IS ABOUT NOT ONLY THE FUTURE BUT THE NOW FOR OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I AM COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH YOU THAT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACTUALLY BEEN PROVED AND- THINKING TWICE ABOUT EVERY SINGLE EXPENSE IS HOW ALL PUBLIC FUNDS SHOULD BE SPENT SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR- CONCERN AND I AND I SHARE IT. I JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP BUT WHEN DO YOU THINK BEYOND IT WILL BE COMPLETED THE AND WILL YOU BE. PREPARED TO PROVIDE US WITH THOUGHT WHAT THE NEW STANDARDS WOULD BE IT SEEMS TO ME THERE NEEDS TO BE CAP. ON WHAT IS ON ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURE IN UP TO WHAT AMOUNT I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION NOT FOR THE PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY FOR US AS DECISION MAKERS. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT DATE OF THE COMPLETION OF THE AUDIT. AND I DON'T WANT TO MISS SPEAK BUT WHAT I KNOW WE'RE WE DO HAVE CSU STAFF IN THE ROOM. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS COMMITTEE AND YOUR OFFICE SPECIFICALLY A BOTH HOPEFULLY IMMEDIATELY THE DATE- AND OF COURSE THE FINDINGS FROM ABOUT IT. THANK YOU AND I AM VERY HIGH ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RE APPOINTMENT SO I'M I WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PAROCHIAL YES MY PRIVATE IF. STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA. EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS. THEY HAVE SEVEN FOUR YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGES. AND UNIVERSITIES ARABS AND NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE ZERO. SO I DON'T THINK YEARS IT CODE SHOULD BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION SO- TWO PRONGED QUESTION ONE ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT DOING MORE REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL CENTERS BECAUSE I HAVE ONE AREA OF FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE NOTHING. SO WE MAKE INVESTMENT ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THEN THEY LEAVE AND THEY NEVER COME BACK. AND THEN TO ARE WE WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO GUARANTEE SEATS FOR THOSE STUDENTS THAT GRADUATE FROM MY THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OPEN ENDED SO. I LOVE THE QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT ACCESS- AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND RESUME HIS IPAD RESUMES BECAUSE I WAS RESUMING STUDENT I TOOK A TON OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES I CAME IN NOT DOING SO WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS IN AND OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL HAD A REALLY TROUBLED PAST- WHICH ENLIGHTEN ME AND BRINGS ME TO PUBLIC SERVICE. I DID COMMITTEE COLLEGE FOR THREE YEARS AND WHEN I FINALLY TRANSFER TO A FOUR UNIVERSITY ONLY ONE OF THOSE CLASSES COUNTED. SO ACCESS TO ME AND CLARITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT PARTICULARLY TO YOUR QUESTION- LAST YEAR IN THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS GOVERNOR. PUT FORTH RESOURCES FOR CONSULTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF THE CSU- PARTICULARLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY- LOOKING STOCKTON. AS ONE PARTICULAR POTENTIAL- POSSIBILITY I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN THE STATE THIS BIG BUT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND RESUME RISEN. FOLKS INTERESTED IN PURSUING THEIR COLLEGE. ARE A EVEN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION HAVE DIRECT ACCESS- AND I'M HOPING HAT MOVING FORWARD THAT REPORT THAT ANALYSIS JUST AS THE SIT ON A SHELF BUT THE WITH THIS LEGISLATURE. IN THE TRUSTEES A LIKE MAKE A REAL COMMITMENT. TO FOLKS EXPECT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS NOW WILL WE HAVE IT IN OUR LIFETIME. THAT'S THE QUESTION AND I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO BE IN CONVERSATION WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE AS I KNOW MEMBERS- BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE BEEN PUSHING THE ACTUALLY WON SAID TODAY TALK ABOUT EXPANSION TALK ABOUT EXPANSION- I THINK IT'S A IT'S A QUESTION OF RESOURCES AND PRIORITY AND THAT PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE MAKING THE- FIRST. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE THAT CHILDREN OF MIGRANT FAMILIES THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- TO ACCESS THIS AMAZING INSTITUTION THAT WE CALL THE CSU I WOULD LOVE. CONTINUING CONVERSATION BUT RIGHT NOW. HAVE A CONSULTANT THEY'RE MOVING FOR. MY HOPE TO SEE THAT REPORT EXTREMELY SOON AND I KNOW THAT STAFF WOULD DELIVER IT TO YOUR OFFICE AND- MORE BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. I'M NOT UNDER ANY ALLUVIAL OF FIRST OF ALL I DON'T REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY I KNOW I KNOW- BUT- I'M NOT UNDER ANY ILLUSION GETTING TO SEE ISSUE CAMPUS ANYTIME SOON BUT THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO DELIVER- EDUCATION AND AGAIN I JUST IT'S JUST A TRAVESTY TO ME THAT. WE AKE ALL THIS INVESTMENT IN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THEN IT THEY NEVER COME BACK AND IT'S HEART BREAKING IN. AND THE REASON FOR THAT I BELIEVE. SO CHICKEN THEY WRITE BUT IT'S HAVING THOSE EDUCATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES THERE SO. I LOOK FOR TO WORKING ON THAT THANK YOU. RACHEL IT IS MUCH. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS. WE WILL. FIND YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM- CONGRATULATIONS MEMPHIS THE THANK YOU SIR LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. OF LET ME JUST. TAG ON TO MY COLLEAGUES CENTER MUNNINGS QUESTION ON THE. QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROPOSAL I RECOGNIZE I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESEARCH THAT YOU ALL DO AND CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE THAT. I WORK FOR THE BOARD TO DO BUT I HAVE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THE- WANTED TO THE RESEARCH REASONING RATHER PROPOSAL THAT'S COMING BEFORE YOU. AND WONDER IF WE'RE SIMPLY ADOPTING A SYSTEM- THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO HIGHER EDUCATION WHEN IN SOME AREAS WERE GOING IN THE ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THOSE WHO. WAY THROUGH THE RESEARCH MAKE AN APPROPRIATE DECISION BUT AT SOME POINT AND LIKE TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND YOUR BOARD MEMBERS ARE ON THAT SUBJECT. RESPECT TO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER VICE CHAIR. I ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN THOSE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE STUDY FOR NEW CAMPUSES. AND I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR ACCESS PARTICULARLY IN THOSE AREAS OF OUR STATE WHICH DO NOT HAVE SI ISSUE CAMPUSES BUT- I WONDER WHY. I DID NOT HEAR AT THE TIME AND HAVE NOT HEARD ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT BRANCH CAMPUSES. OF A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ESTABLISH A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OF THE PROBLEM WITH DOING SO OF COURSE IS SOMEWHAT ALIGNED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE BUDGET SO YOU NEED A PRESIDENT YOU NEED AN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT YOU NEED FIVE VICE PRESIDENTS. DEANS AND ALL OF THE REST WHICH WE HAVE AT OUR EXISTING CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES AND WE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY NEED IF WE ESTABLISHED A BRANCH CAMPUS WITH A BRANCH CAMPUSES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WERE IN CENTER WORKS TO. SOME OTHER LOCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSROOMS AND INSTRUCTORS YET WITH A BRANCH CAMPUS SHE WOULD HAVE ACCESS CLASSROOMS AND INSTRUCTORS AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD- AND ACHIEVE YOUR HIGHER EDUCATION OBJECTIVES SO I'M HOPING THAT- IN YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE ON PC ISSUE BOARD. MAYBE YOU COULD- IF THAT DISCUSSION IS NOT OCCURRING YOU COULD YOU WOULD CONSIDER INITIATING THAT CONVERSATION. TO SEE WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO IS A STATE LEGISLATURE- TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BOTH FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TODAY. WHAT WHAT IS. I'D APPRECIATE THE COMMENT. BECAUSE WHAT I THINK WE ARE BOTH SAYING AND SOME ERROR HOW I'M HEARING IT. WE DO HAVE EXTENSIONS BUT ARE THEY SIMPLY IN PLACES WHERE CITIES AND REGIONS WHERE THEY'RE ALREADY A BIG- BRICK AND MORTAR CAMPUS. AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO A STAFF IS IMMEDIATELY GET- THIS FULL RULES RULES COMMITTEE- NOT ONLY OUR MAP BUT OUR LIST OF EXTENSION- INSTITUTIONS. BUT WHERE THERE ARE NONE WHAT HAPPENS IS- OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OR RESUME OURS THEY LEAVE. AND THEY DON'T COME BACK. OR THEY JUST DON'T GO AN ONLINE EDUCATION WHILE THE SALE THE CSU PROVIDES IT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND SO- I THINK WE CAN ONE GET YOU WHAT WHAT IS NOW AND- OF THE TRUSTEE. SOMETIMES IT TAKES A FEW YEARS FOR YOU TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING PHYSICALLY ON YOUR DESK I'VE BEEN ON THE CSU FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW AND I KNOW STAFF- I KNOW THE RHYTHM OF HOW THINGS WORK AND INSTEAD OF JUST BEING ON THE BOARD IT WAS TELLING STAFF EARLIER IT'S TIME TO REALLY DO SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS BODY THE NOT ONLY MOVE THE ACCESS CONVERSATION TO THE DIVERSITY CONVERSATION- AND SO I LOOK FOR TO BE IN COMMUNICATION WITH YOU AND WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES. BUT IN THE NEAR TERM LET'S GET YOU THE REPORT OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY EXIST THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IN FOR THE BUY IT IN OTHER WORDS IT'S CHEAPER TO CITE A BRANCH THAN IT IS TO BUILD A CAMP THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT. AND MY FINAL QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH- ACADEMIC COUNSELING I. HAVING VISITED THE. ONE OR MORE CSU CAMPUSES- BEING INVITED TO PARTICIPATE WAS SO MY COLLEAGUES WHO WERE. CONDUCTING SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS OVER THE BREAK I. HAVE BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACADEMIC COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIO. ON RC ISSUE AND ACTUALLY ARE UC CAMPUSES AS WELL. I GATHER THAT THE RATIO VARIES FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS- AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO YOUR VIEWS ON THE ROLE THAT- ACADEMIC COUNSELING. AFFECTED MISS OF ACADEMIC COUNSELING PLAY. FOR PLAYS IN. THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. OF THAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO PUSH FORWARD. I AT CSU ONE- AND TWO WHETHER YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACADEMIC COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIO AT C. ISSUE- AND WHAT YOU THINK WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT. YEAH BUT TO BE MORE MONEY IT'S ALWAYS MORE MONEY SIR. IN THE INTERIM I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S EXCITING I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING AT MY GRADUATION INITIATIVE KICHI IS IN A PART OF THAT THAT THE CORE PIECE OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS NOT JUST MORE COURSES- BUT HIS GUIDANCE. WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THAT CITY CALLED BY CITY COLLEGE PASSED. BACK BEFORE WE HAD- ONLINE ENROLLMENT YOU WOULD FILL OUT A FORM. AND YOU WOULD GET THE CLASSES THAT YOU FILLED OUT IN THE CSU WHEN YOU'RE REGISTERING UNDER THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WE'VE NOT ONLY DONE TO THE BRICK AND MORTAR. INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE'VE ALSO INCREASE OUR TECHNOLOGY YOU GET YOUR GETTING ONLINE. GUIDANCE BUT YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT EACH CAMPUS GETS INCREASED GUIDANCE STAFF THE BUT IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH I'M SO WE HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING OUR AVERAGE THE AVERAGE STUDENT POPULATION AT MOST OF OUR UNIVERSITIES OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FOLKS- SO WE CAN CONTINUE NOT ONLY TO INCREASE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CHOICE. A STUDENT IS MAKING THERE'S A GUIDANCE POINT IN ROME AT THERE'S A GUIDANCE POINT IF YOU ARE ENROLLING IN A CLASS THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO YOU. THE SECOND SEND YOU THROUGH THAT THEY- THROUGH THE METICULOUS IN PROCESS IT'LL IT'LL POP UP YOUR ALSO ASKED TO PHYSICALLY SIT DOWN WITH A HUMAN BEING BUT I WOULD AGREE. WE NEED MORE HUMANS. AT EVERY STAGE X. SPECIALLY WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE HAVING THE MOST TROUBLE NOT JUST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER BUT THE PRESIDENT SET IN THE BEAUTIFUL PART ABOUT BEING A TRUSTEE YOU GET TO GO TO-THE CAMPUSES AND HANG OUT WITH STUDENTS AND TALK TO STAFF AND NOT JUST THE PRESIDEN'S BUT- EVERY PRESIDENT THAT I'VE TALKED TO AND WORKED WITH- THEY'RE CONVINCED THAT THEIR ROLE IS NOT ONLY TO KEEP. THE INSTITUTION OF FLOAT BUT TO MAKE SURE BEFORE THAT YOUNG PERSON JUMPS OFF THE EDUCATIONAL CLIFF THAT WE GRABBED HIM BACK. IT'S AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR THE GRADUATION ISSUE OF APPROACHES. AGAIN THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM OF STUDENTS OF THE ATTRITION BUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE SOME SUPPORT THERE HOPEFULLY THE SYSTEM AS METRICS AND I DON'T MEAN IT I DON'T MEAN JUST HOW LONG IT TAKES A STUDENT TO GET IN TO SEE AN ACADEMIC COUNSELORS MIDDLE OF CANCERS OR ENTER A DIFFERENT STORY. NOT ANY BETTER BUT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET INTO CITY SEE AN ACADEMIC COUNSELOR AND SOME STUDENT ASSESSMENT THE CUSTOMER'S ASSESSMENT ON HOW EFFECTIVE THE COUNSELING WAS AT THE TIME BECAUSE MY PERCEPTION. REMEMBER I AM SOLD THE ONE I REGISTERED FOR CLASSES YOU STOOD IN A LINE AND THEY HANDED YOU A COMPUTER PUNCH CARD AND WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF CARDS YOU DIDN'T GET INTO THE CLASS THINK IT WAS LIKE THAT IN NINETY EIGHT SERVICE OUT TO OREGON. BUT IF THERE'S A MISTAKE MADE IN THE COUNT. THE STUDENT CAN'T GET TO SEE THE COUNSELOR WITH HIS COUNSELOR MAKES A MISTAKE-BECAUSE OF LACK OF TRAINING OR EXPERIENCE. THAN MY PERCEPTION IS THAT SETS COULD SET THE STUDENT BACK ONE TWO THREE FOUR SEMESTERS. IN TERMS OF MOVING DOWN TOWARD THE GRADUATION FINISH LINE AND SO. IT'S INCUMBENT. FALLING BOND THE INSTITUTION TO GIVE US THE DATA TO ASSESS THE BUDGET REQUESTS AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON THE LEGISLATURE THAN. TO PROPERLY FUND THE ACADEMIC COUNSELING COMPONENT OF THE C. ISSUE AND ALSO THE UC BUDGET SO THAT YOU THE INSTITUTION HAS THE COUNSELORS THE STUDENTS HAVE THE COUNSELORS. NECESSARY TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS SUFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. FIRST TIME EVERY TIME AND SO I'D ASK YOU TO TAKE  LOOK AT THAT AS WELL ABSOLUTELY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE OF FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION AS WELL THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF. SO LET ME- MOVED TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND ASK- THOSE WERE HERE IN SUPPORT.

HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE CSU SYSTEM IS THE LARGEST AB PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY- AS YOU KNOW- CHAIRWOMAN AND SPEAKER- AND AS YOU KNOW. MISS SAM AND AS I KNOW. THE PATH OUT OF POVERTY FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS IS PAVED WITH. EDUCATION. FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND CHILDREN BORN INTO POVERTY. THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING A POVERTY ARE VERY SMALL. EDUCATION WILL BE A BIG PART OF THAT IF THEY MAKE IT. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS PERSONALLY- I KNOW ALSO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO THROUGH AN EDUCATION WITH CHILDREN. A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION AND OUR CS USE OUR REGION WHERE STUDENTS AND MANY OF THEM ARE STUDENTS WITH CHILDREN WHEN A CHILD SEES A PARENT GO THROUGH THEIR EDUCATION THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY- AND CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL HAS SUPPORTED EDUCATION AS A PATH OUT OF POVERTY YOU KNOW THIS VISION YOU'RE WORKING HARD TO END HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS WITHIN OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AND I CAN THINK OF NOBODY ELSE. NOBODY BETTER TO LEAD THIS WORK- OF EQUITY- FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS- THAN THE PERSON YOU HAVE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I'M SO IT'S THROUGH THE ETHNICALLY SUPPORT HER NOMINATION CONGRATULATIONS. Q. HI WELCOME HI MY NAME'S JENNIFER EGAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TWENTY NINE THOUSAND OR SO FACULTY MEMBERS- THAT WE REPRESENT AT THE CSU A SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE DEEP ASSIGNMENTS REAPPOINTMENT. THE DIVA SIMON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE VERY FEW INDEPENDENT VOICES ON THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES HE'S CONSISTENTLY VOTED AGAINST RAISING STUDENT FEES AND SPOKEN THROUGH A SOCIAL JUSTICE LANDS ON ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENT. THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND THE HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY OF OUR STUDENTS AMONG OTHER ISSUES. A TRUSTEE SIMON IS CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS COME FROM MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BOARD AND IT SHOWS IN HER ACTIONS AND I JUST WANNA TELL A VERY BRIEF STORY ABOUT- HER AT THE WAY SHE IS AT THE BOARD AND THE OF HER PERFORMANCE AS A TRUSTEE. IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO THANK TRUSTEE SIMON FOR THE HUMANITY AND COMPASSION THAT SHE SHOWED TO CHARMAINE LAWSON WHO IS THE MOTHER OF DAVID JOSIAH LAWSON A STUDENT AT HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WAS MURDERED NEAR THE CAMPUS. CFA SUPPORTED MISS LAWSON IN HER ATTEMPT TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR HER SON AS WELL AS SUPPORTING THE STUDENTS WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST RACIALIZED VIOLENCE ON OUR CAMPUSES WHICH INCLUDED FEAR OF THE POLICE. WHILE THE OTHER TRUSTEES IN THE ROOM AT FRANKLY SAT THERE PRETTY MOTIONLESS AND PRETTY PASSIONLESS AS MS LAWSON EXPRESSED HER PAIN AND PLEADED FOR HELP TRUSTEE SIMON RESPONDED BY COMING TO HER PUTTING HER ARM AROUND HER AND HAVING A REAL CONVERSATION. NO ONE ELSE DID THAT IN THE MOMENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THAT IS WHY I THINK A TRUSTY SIMON'S PRESENCE ON THE BOARD IS SO IMPORTANT SO I WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE AND TRUSTEE SIMON.
