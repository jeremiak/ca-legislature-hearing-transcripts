RELEASED THERE'S NOTHING IN

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.798
THIS BILL THAT PROVIDES THAT.

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.901
SECONDLY WHAT GIVES ME CONCERN-

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:40.435
AND GIVE THE VICTIMS OF CRIME

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:43.272
CONCERNS ON AB THREE TWENTY

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:44.306
NINE IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:45.974
TARGETING BUT- BOTH LOCAL

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.084
ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:57.419
POPULATION THAT WILL BE

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.154
AFFECTED BY PEOPLE BEING

ACCOUNTABILITY AND ESPECIALLY

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:03.258
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MATHIS

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:05.594
FUTURES I THINK THAT MEMBERS OF

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:08.130
THIS COMMISSION- KNOW VERY WELL

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.564
THAT THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:12.000
TIME FOR A VICTIM IS WHEN. HE

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.669
OR SHE ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.470
THEIR ABUSERS AND TO HAVE

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:16.538
SOMEBODY RELEASED WITHOUT

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.679
NOT. BEING ABLE TO BE HEARD

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:24.780
BEFORE THEY RELEASE IT IS

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:26.882
CRITICAL TO THE SAFETY AND THE

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:34.656
PUBLIC. SAFETY- I UNDERSTAND

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:35.457
THAT. ABOUT INCARCERATING

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.959
PEOPLE PAYING TO GET A I HAVE

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:38.160
RESPECT FOR THE- SITE WE ARE WE

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.361
TO WORK TOWARDS THAT IN FACT WE

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:40.829
ARE WORKING WITH A SUPPLEMENT

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.230
COOPER WHO HAS A BILL THAT

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.232
ADDRESSES THOSE ISSUES THAT I

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.101
BELIEVE IS MUCH MORE THAT IS A

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.970
WELL THOUGHT. OUT IN THE REALM

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:49.738
OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND I WOULD

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.640
URGE THE MEMBERS TO CONSIDER

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.709
THAT AND CONSIDER THAT WE NEED

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:55.744
TO FIND. A REMEDY THAT NOT ONLY

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.746
ADDRESSES THE ISSUE THAT THIS

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:59.481
BILL IS TRYING TO TRUST BUT

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:00.916
ALSO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:03.518
VICTIMS. AND LASTLY I WOULD

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:04.720
URGE YOU TO ALSO LISTEN TO YOUR

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.888
CONSTITUENTS AND VOTERS- JUST

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:09.024
TO NOTE THAT FOR WE HAD. AN

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:13.528
ISSUE DID. THAT TRY TO- AS

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:16.131
EFFECTIVELY AWAY. CAL AND I

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.466
KNOW THAT THERE'S ISSUES THAT

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:18.667
THE WITH ARGUMENTS WILL THAT

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:19.901
WAS BASED ON THE SYSTEM SMALL

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:21.536
FROM THE VICTIM PERSPECTIVE.

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:24.373
WHO WAS A STRONG- UP AGAINST

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.441
THAT INITIATIVE CAME OUT STRONG

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:28.477
AND FINISH IT UP MANY CRAP. DAY

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:29.978
AGAIN FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.747
ARE BRINGING. FORTH THAT THERE

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:33.248
WAS NO PROTECTIONS FOR OUR

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.017
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS NO

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:37.986
BALANCE IN THE SYSTEM. I AGREED

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.688
THAT THE BILL SCHEDULE NEEDS TO

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.189
BE ADDRESSED I DON'T THINK

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:42.257
THERE'S ANY CRIME VICTIM THAT

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.425
DOESN'T AGREE THAT THE BAIL

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.860
SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.194
AND THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:47.896
INCARCERATED. JUST SIMPLY

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.131
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:51.033
MONETARY NEEDS. BUT THAT DOES

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:52.868
NOT MEAN THAT WE CAN JUST LET

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.469
THEM OUT WITHOUT CONSIDERATION

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:56.671
OF THE VICTIM'S SAFETY. I WOULD

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.874
RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.176

AB THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN THAT

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.871
WOULD PUT AN END. TO THE UNFAIR

THREATS TO PUBLIC SFETY THAT

UNACCEPTABLE RISK TO THE

COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE THE COURT

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:03.018
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IMPOSE

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:04.919
ZERO BAIL ON MOST HATE CRIMES

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:06.488
AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE PAINFULLY

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:08.089
AWARE OF THEIR INCREASING

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:10.525
FREQUENCY AND MATHIS. ZERO BAIL

DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ALLEGED

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:22.771

NOTHING UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:53.101

YOUR QUESTION. MISTER LUCKY

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:19.140
THIS IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:22.677
THAN SB TEN- ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

01:26:22.744 --> 01:26:25.847
FIVE SB TEN AND PROP TWENTY

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:26.714
FIVE PROPOSED TO COMPLETELY

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:27.749
ELIMINATE MONEY BAIL AND

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:28.950
REPLACE IT WITH WHAT YOU'RE

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.318
REFERRING TO A RISK ASSESSMENT

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.520
TOOL AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:35.857
DISCRETION AND- SETTING BAIL-

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.025
THIS IS BUILDING OFF SOMETHING

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.526
THAT WE'VE HAD IN PLACE DURING

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:40.929
THE PANDEMIC- AS WELL AS

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.764
APPROACH IS THAT HAVE OCCURRED

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.299
SUCCESSFULLY IN OTHER

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.400
JURISDICTIONS LIKE NEW YORK NEW

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:48.570
JERSEY- KENTUCKY WHERE THERE

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:51.940
WAS- ZERO BAIL OR SITE RELEASE

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.008
THAT DIDN'T RELY ON BAIL. FIVE

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:55.810
WHICH LED TO MANY MORE PEOPLE

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.445
BE SAFELY RELEASED CRIME RATE

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:58.279
TO THE WENT DOWN OR HELD

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:00.915
STEADY- APPEARANCE RATES HELD

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:04.986
STRONG- RE OFFENSE- RATES I

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.487
DIDN'T DIDN'T MOVE SO WE THINK

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:07.689
IT'S AN APPROACH THAT CAN LEAD

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:08.423
TO MANY MORE PEOPLE BEING

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:10.658
SAFELY AND FAIRLY RELEASED

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:13.194
WITHOUT- THREATENING PUBLIC

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:14.929
SAFETY SO IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.197
APPROACH I GUESS IS THE SHORT

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:20.068
ANSWER- TO YOUR QUESTION AND-

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:22.904
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SB TEN-

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:24.906
MONEY BAIL CONTINUES TO EXIST.

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.609
WITH THIS UP PROPOSAL TODAY-

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.477
WITH AB THREE TO THREE TWENTY

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:30.244
NINE BUT IT DOES HAVE

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:31.980
COMPONENTS OF ZERO BALANCE

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:34.315
ACCOUNTABILITY- CONSIDERATION

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:39.020
OF THE ABILITY. TO PASS AS SET

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:39.621
FORTH IN THE BILL. OKAY WILL

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:40.254
REGRETTABLY I WILL BE ABLE TO

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:42.023
SUPPORT THE BILL. AS IT STANDS

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.491
CURRENTLY I ALSO BELIEVE IT'S

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:45.393
IN DIRECT CONTRAST TO THE-

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:48.262
EXPRESSED WILL OF THE PEOPLE-

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:50.131
BY PROPOSITION TWENTY FIVE IN

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:53.735
THE LAST ELECTION SO- THAT'S

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:55.336
TOTAL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS.

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:57.939
THANK YOU MR QUIRK. YES

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.540
ARAMBULA BY WILL BE SUPPORTING

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:01.409
THE BILL TODAY BUT I DO THINK

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:05.413
IT NEEDS SOME WORK- AND IN

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.182
LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:10.885
FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.754
THE FACT THAT IT I DO THINK

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.822
THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO ALLOW

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:18.259
JUDGES SOME DISCRETION- IN-

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.927
THERE MAY BE PEOPLE OF

01:28:19.994 --> 01:28:21.362
COMMITTED SOME OF THESE LESS

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:24.599
VIOLENT CRIMES. WHO THEY FEEL

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:28.136
NEED TO PAY BAIL OR PERHAPS

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:28.670
THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF NOT

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:31.806
SHOWING UP. WHATEVER IT IS I DO

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.574
THINK WE NEED THAT DISCRETION

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:36.744
IF IT'S NOT IN THE BILL- SECOND

01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:40.515
I AM CONCERNED THAT. THE PEOPLE

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:43.284
WHO DO HAVE TO PAY BAIL MAY NOT

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:46.120
HAVE RECOURSE TO BAILS BONDSMEN.

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:47.655
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:49.791
SINCE YOU REQUIRE THAT THE

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:52.493
MONEY ESSENTIALLY BE GIVEN 95%

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.429
OF IT BE GIVEN BACK I DON'T

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:55.997
THINK ANYBODY WILL BE IN THE

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:58.032
BAIL BOND BUSINESS. AND LAST

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:01.269
WEEK WE- SET BAIL AT A MUCH

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:02.837
LOWER AMOUNT WHICH WOULD BE A

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:05.940
GOOD SOLUTION MAYBE 10% OF WHAT

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:08.209
THEY TYPICALLY IS TODAY FIVE

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:09.944
THOUSAND INSTEAD OF FIFTY.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:12.146
THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH TO GET

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:15.116
PEOPLE TO SHOW UP. SO IF WE

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:18.486
WERE TO REACH RESET THE SYSTEM.

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.787
I'D BE IN FAVOR OF JUST

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.356
BRINGING EVERYTHING DOWN 90% I

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:23.224
THINK THAT WOULD BE A BETTER

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:26.327
APPROACH- FOR THE POPLE THAT

01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:27.795
YOU'RE YOU DO NEED TO KEEP IN

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:29.263
JAIL AND AGAIN A JUDGE CAN

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.532
ALWAYS SAY. WE WILL NOT ALLOW

01:29:31.599 --> 01:29:33.601
BAILIN THIS CASE SO THINK

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:36.237
ABOUT THOSE THINGS AS A AND NO

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:38.272
NO GOOD BILL GOES UNCHANGED

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:40.374
ISSUE. SO JUST THINK ABOUT

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:41.743
THOSE THINGS THANK YOU VERY

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:44.712
MUCH MR BONTA. I THANK THANK

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:45.246

HAS A QUESTION DID YOU WANT TO

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:51.953
ASK I DID YEAH THAT MIGHT BE

01:29:52.019 --> 01:29:52.653
HELPFUL FOR OTHERS WHO ARE

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.021

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.590
LINES BUT JUST WANT TO THANK

SOMEONE FOR CORPORATES ALWAYS

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.226
THOUGHTFUL INPUT. I DO WANT TO

01:29:58.292 --> 01:29:59.660
REITERATE THAT WE ARE TALKING

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.596
ABOUT A POPULATION THAT IS

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:02.830
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:03.931
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:06.134
ANYTHING. AT THIS STAGE IN THE

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.636
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND WE

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:09.237
BELIEVE THAT NOTHING IN THIS

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:11.706
BILL CONFLICTS WITH. ARTICLE

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:12.340

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.513
DISCRETION TO DETAIN PRE TRIAL-

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.515
WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SO IF

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:21.649
THAT IS NOT CLEAR TO THE

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:24.786
OPPOSITION- WE WILL SEEK TO

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:26.821
MAKE THAT CLEAR- AND WE DO HAVE

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:28.289
A COUPLE OF THE BILL WHICH

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:28.856
SEEKS TO HAVE THE JUDICIAL

INCLUDED AGREES THAT OUR

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.104
CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE ONE

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.873
REMAINS INCARCERATED MERELY

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.174
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY AND

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:22.109
THEIR POOR IS A BROKEN SYSTEM.

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:24.078
AND ONE THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.146
TO BE FIXED BECAUSE THE

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.481
QUESTION BEFORE ANY COURT WHEN

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:28.716
DECIDING WHO SHOULD BE HELD

WHEN INNOCENT BECAUSE WE'RE

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:31.652
TALKING FREE TRIAL SHOULD BE

WHO IS A REST OUR COMMUNITY NOT

IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE SOMEONE

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:38.860
WHO IS LED OUT WHO WASN'T RISK

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:40.528
BECAUSE HE HAD THE MEANS TO PAY

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:42.196
FOR IT AND THAT THAT TOO IS A

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:43.831
PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO BE A

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:45.666
HOLDING THOSE WHO POSE A RISK

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.668
AND ALLOWING THOSE WHO DO NOT

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:49.437
POSE A RISK TO OUR COMMUNITY.

01:31:49.503 --> 01:31:51.239
TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND TO

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:53.007
KEEP THEIR JOB AND KEEP A ROOF

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:53.507
OVER THEIR HEAD AND WE

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:55.076
UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:57.945
BEING INCARCERATED BEFORE YOUR

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:58.846
TRIAL IN BEFORE YOU'VE BEEN

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:00.548
FOUND GUILTY AND THEN UNTIL

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.083
THAT HAPPENS ONE SHOULD BE ABLE

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:03.017
IF THEY'RE NOT A RISK TO

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.653
SOCIETY TO MAINTAIN THAT- THOSE

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.854
IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THEIR

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:09.891
LIFE. THAT BEING SAID I SHARE A

01:32:09.957 --> 01:32:11.325
LOT OF THE CONCERNS OF THE

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:14.662
OPPOSITION- AND OF MY COLLEAGUE.

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:16.264
THAT THIS BILL'S FAILURE TO

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:19.267
PROVIDE ANY. RISK ASSESSMENT OR

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.068
JUDICIAL DISCRETION LEAVES US

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:24.238
OPEN TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DO POSE

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:26.173
A RISK TO OUR COMMUNITIES BEING

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.942
LED OUT AND I GUESS I DO READ

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.577
IT DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU DO I

01:32:29.644 --> 01:32:32.079
DON'T BELIEVE IT- MAINTAINS THE

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:33.314
DISCUSSION HELD UNDER THE

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:34.682
CONSTITUTION I READ THE BILL TO

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:36.751
REQUIRE COURTS FOR THOSE

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:37.952
CHARGED WITH THESE OFFENSES TO

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:38.986
LET THEM OUT OF ZERO BALANCE

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:41.055
NOT THE CONCERN OF MINE SO IF

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:42.490
YOU DO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S- I

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:43.925
THINK. A GOOD AMENDMENT THAT

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:44.926
WILL HOPEFULLY BE TAKEN IN THE

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.928
FUTURE BUT I'M GLAD THAT THERE

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:47.995
ARE SEVERAL BILLS MOVING IN

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.063
THIS SPACE I'M GLAD WE'RE

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.364
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I LOOK

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:51.899
FORWARD TO A BILL THAT I THINK

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:53.834
STRIKS THAT BALANCE OF

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:54.735
ENSURING THAT WE'RE PROTECTING

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:56.203
OUR COMMUNITY AND NOT

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:57.371
INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR BEING

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:59.674
INDIGENT- BUT I CAN'T AT THIS

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.275
POINT- SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:02.310
DON'T THINK IT YET STRIKES THE

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:04.812
RIGHT BALANCE IN PROTECTING OUR

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:07.114
COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU.

THERE'S A PERFECT SYSTEM- MY

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:35.509
BELIEF IS THAT THE CURRENT

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:36.477
SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:39.046
UNACCEPTABLE- WE DO HAVE

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:39.714
WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO COULD OR

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.582

ABSOLUTELY NO RISK WILL COME TO

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:49.123
OTHER HEARING TOOK SIMPLY CAN'T

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.791
BE RELEASED BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:51.459
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY BECAUSE

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:53.494
THEY'RE POOR BUT THAT IS WRONG

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:54.795
YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CHANGE IT

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.731

WHILE IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:12.513

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:35.154
CRITICAL IN GETTING JUSTICE IN

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:37.056
OUR SYSTEM I HAD A QUESTION

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:39.025
OBVIOUSLY THE BILL ALLOWS FOR

01:56:39.092 --> 01:56:40.493

SENSE- OBVIOUSLY IN HEARING A

01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:49.969
DEFENSE AND WORKING WITH A

THE CHANCES ARE OF WINNING YOUR

01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:58.411
CASE TO COURT IN PLAYING OUT

01:56:58.478 --> 01:57:00.012
XCERRA AND SO DOING IS IN

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:01.581
CONVERSATION WITH THEIR CLIENTS

01:57:01.647 --> 01:57:04.417
ABOUT THE CASE- OBVIOUSLY IN

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:06.519
THAT THERE'S NO NEED TO SHARE

01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:07.620
TELEPHONE NUMBERS ADDRESSES

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:10.156
ETCETERA I GUESS MY CONCERN IS

01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:11.057
THAT IN THAT CONVERSATION

01:57:11.124 --> 01:57:13.025
SHOULD. THE EMPLOYER FOR

01:57:13.092 --> 01:57:14.660
EXAMPLE OR THE NATURE OF THE

01:57:14.727 --> 01:57:16.662
WORK AND THE INDIVIDUAL AND

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:18.431
VICTIM COME UP IN THE

01:57:18.498 --> 01:57:20.500
ASSESSMENT OF THE CASE THAT

01:57:20.566 --> 01:57:21.734
WOULD SEEM LIKE A VIOLATION OF

01:57:21.801 --> 01:57:23.469
THIS LAW SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:25.238
TOUCH ON THAT BRIEFLY BECAUSE I

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:28.674
THINK THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:57:28.741 --> 01:57:29.275
THE ATTORNEY AND THE CLIENT IS

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:30.343
REALLY CRITICAL. WELL I CAN

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.577
TELL YOU AT LEAST AT THIS POINT

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.379
RIGHT NOW AND WE WERE TALKING

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:34.514
ABOUT YOU KNOW ANY TYPE OF

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.516
PENALTY THAT COMES FOUR EIGHT.

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:38.184
AND A CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW HAS

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:40.153
IT THAT IF THE DEFENSE CONSERVE

01:57:40.219 --> 01:57:41.454
VIOLATES THIS PROVISION NOT

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:43.055
ONLY WAS IT A DISHONEST METER

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:44.690
BUT- THEY'RE ALSO SUBJECT TO

01:57:44.757 --> 01:57:46.426
PENALTY AND POTENTIAL DISPARITY

01:57:46.492 --> 01:57:47.927
FROM THE STATE BAR. AND I

01:57:47.994 --> 01:57:50.530
THOUGHT THAT WAS A SUFFICIENT

01:57:50.596 --> 01:57:51.798
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH PENALTY.

01:57:51.864 --> 01:57:53.499
RAISE MY QUESTION IS IN THE

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:54.066
PENALTY ON THE ATTORNEY THE

01:57:54.133 --> 01:57:56.602
QUESTION IS. I GUESS MY CONCERN

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:59.005
IS COULD- TO ATTORNEY BE BARRED

01:57:59.071 --> 01:57:59.672
FROM HAVING AN HONEST

01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:01.374
CONVERSATION WITH THEIR CLIENT

01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:02.875
ABOUT THE CASE BECAUSE THE

01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:04.877
BREADTH OF THE INFORMATION THAT

01:58:04.944 --> 01:58:06.946
IS NOT PROTECTED. IS SO WIDE.

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.781
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T GIVE I MEAN

01:58:08.848 --> 01:58:10.683
IT WAS BEFORE I BELIEVE

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:12.351
TELEPHONE NUMBER ADDRESS IS

01:58:12.418 --> 01:58:13.519
JUST AS TO ADDRESS THOSE TWO

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:14.687
THINGS WHICH IS EASY AS A

01:58:14.754 --> 01:58:15.688
DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO HAVE A-

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:17.490
FULL CONVERSATION WITH A QUITE

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:17.957
WITHOUT GIVING UP THAT

01:58:18.024 --> 01:58:19.292
INFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARY.

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:21.093
HOWEVER I CAN IMAGINE AS THE

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:21.894
OPPOSITION POINTS OUT

01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:23.029
SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S REALLY

01:58:23.095 --> 01:58:23.796
IMPORTANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR

01:58:23.863 --> 01:58:25.731
CLIENT ABOUT. THE NATURE OF THE

01:58:25.798 --> 01:58:27.934
EMPLOYMENT OF THE VICTIM RIGHT

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.368
IN DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:30.603
CASE AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:32.271
PLEAD OR GO TO TRIAL OR-

01:58:32.338 --> 01:58:33.673
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AND

01:58:33.739 --> 01:58:34.540
THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF

01:58:34.607 --> 01:58:37.176
THIS LAW. LEADING TO DISBARMENT

01:58:37.243 --> 01:58:38.478
AND A MISDEMEANOR AND I GUESS

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:40.179
THAT CONCERNS ME THAT THAT

01:58:40.246 --> 01:58:41.280
CLIENT ATTORNEY RELATIONSHIP

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.782
WOULD BE HAMPERED BECAUSE OF

01:58:42.849 --> 01:58:44.350
THE REST OF THE INFORMATION

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:45.852
THAT'S NOT PROTECTED. WHAT I

01:58:45.918 --> 01:58:47.887
BELIEVE ON THIS AND- IN THIS IS

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:48.988
SOMETHING I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:50.690
LOOK UP IS THAT THAT WAS IT

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:51.624
THAT IF THEY NEEDED TO HAVE

01:58:51.691 --> 01:58:52.792
THIS INFORMATION AND THEY COULD

01:58:52.859 --> 01:58:54.093
PROVE THAT IT WOULD HELP YOU

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.461
KNOW BE PART OF THE CASE THAT

01:58:55.528 --> 01:58:56.395
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ASK FOR

01:58:56.462 --> 01:59:01.300
IT. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:04.604

01:59:15.548 --> 01:59:17.316
MISTAKEN I BELIEVE ONE OF THE

01:59:17.383 --> 01:59:19.485
MEN MEANT THAT- WERE BEING

01:59:19.552 --> 01:59:21.087
CONSIDERED AND WAS BEING

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:23.389
ACCEPTED IT WOULD BE TO ALSO

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:24.090
ADDED THAT THAT THE FIVE

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:27.693
EXCEPTION- THE LOCATION OF

INCLUDE THE NATURE OF

WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:24.870
REGULATIONS FOR RUBBER BULLETS

02:02:24.937 --> 02:02:27.339
AND TEAR GAS. ASSEMBLY BILL

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:27.873

ENFORCEMENT'S USE OF SO CALLED

02:02:30.443 --> 02:02:32.078
LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPONS LIKE

02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:33.212
RUBBER BULLETS PEPPER SPRAY

02:02:33.279 --> 02:02:34.714
TEAR GAS FOR CROWD CONTROL

AND JOURNALISTS THAT WE KNOW OF

02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:44.190
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SIXTEEN

02:02:44.256 --> 02:02:45.091
SERIOUS INJURIES FROM RUBBER

02:02:45.157 --> 02:02:47.293
BULLETS AND BEAN BAG ROUNDS AT

02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:48.360
THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:02:48.427 --> 02:02:50.062
INCLUDING SEVEN PEOPLE WHO LOST

02:02:50.129 --> 02:02:52.131
AN EYE. WE'VE ALL SEEN JUST HOW

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:53.766
DANGEROUS LESS THAN LETHAL

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:54.734
WEAPONS CAN BE IN THE EVIDENCE

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.802
SUPPORTS THAT A TWENTY

02:02:56.869 --> 02:02:57.770
SEVENTEEN STUDY FOUND THAT 3%

02:02:57.837 --> 02:02:58.871
OF PEOPLE HIT WITH RUBBER

02:02:58.938 --> 02:03:01.741
BULLETS ACTUALLY DIE IN 15% ARE

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:03.809
LEFT PERMANENTLY DISABLED IT IS

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:04.910
CLEAR THAT THESE WEAPONS ARE

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:06.712
INAPPROPRIATE FOR SIMPLE CROWD

02:03:06.779 --> 02:03:08.781
CONTROL. NO ONE WHO SIMPLY

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:09.982
EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST

02:03:10.049 --> 02:03:11.383
SHOULD BE SCARED TO FACE

02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:12.785
SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH BECAUSE

02:03:12.852 --> 02:03:14.220
OFFICERS ARE INDISCRIMINATELY

02:03:14.286 --> 02:03:15.554
FIRING RUBBER BULLETS INTO A

02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:17.289
CROWD FOR USING HARMFUL

02:03:17.356 --> 02:03:20.159
CHEMICAL AGENTS. AB FORTY EIGHT

02:03:20.226 --> 02:03:21.660
WOULD CREATE STANDARDS THAT

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:23.696
ONLY ALLOW TRAINED OFFICERS TO

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:25.564
USE THESE TOOLS AND WEAPONS IF

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:27.166
THERE'S A THREAT TO LIFE OR

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:29.101
SERIOUS INJURY TO AN INDIVIDUAL

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:30.302
OFFICERS MAY NOT USE THEM

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:31.470
SOLELY FOR VIOLATIONS OF

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:33.205
IMPOSED CURFEW BECAUSE OF

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:35.508
VERBAL THREATS OR NON

COMPLIANCE FROM A LAW

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.943
ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE. OFFICERS

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:38.978
WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE DE

02:03:39.044 --> 02:03:40.312
ESCALATION TECHNIQUES FIRST

02:03:40.379 --> 02:03:42.014
INCLUDING WARNING THE CROWD AND

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:42.882
GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:03:42.948 --> 02:03:44.350
PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE SCENE

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:45.217
BEFORE THEY DEPLOY THESE

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:46.919
WEAPONS THEY COULD ONLY USE

02:03:46.986 --> 02:03:47.686
THESE WEAPONS IN A MATTER

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:48.988
PROPORTIONAL TO THE THREAT NOT

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:50.356
INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST A

CROWD OR TARGETED AT THE HEAD

02:03:51.924 --> 02:03:54.160
OR NECK. AB FORTY EIGHT WOULD

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:55.494
ALSO REQUIRE POLICE DEPARTMENTS

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:57.363
REPORT THE USE OF KINETIC

02:03:57.429 --> 02:03:58.831
PROJECTILES AND CHEMICAL AGENTS

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:00.533
TO THE DOJ MONTHLY WHICH WILL

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:02.201
FURTHER PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:03.435
ON THESE PROJECTILES AND

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:05.204
CHEMICAL AGENTS THIS BILL IS

02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:06.105
LONG OVERDUE AND IT'S TIME FOR

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:07.406
CALIFORNIA BE A LEADER IN

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:11.177
PROTECTING PROTESTERS. AGAINST

02:04:11.243 --> 02:04:11.777
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BY THE

LONG LASTING IMPACTS OF THESE

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:16.715
DANGEROUS WEAPONS WHEN USED

02:04:16.782 --> 02:04:18.651
IMPROPERLY THEY'RE ON THE PHONE.

02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:24.523
THANK YOU. THAT'S YOU HAVE FIVE

ROOM PHYSICIAN IN BERKELEY

02:04:54.353 --> 02:04:56.856
CALIFORNIA I THIRTY PROTESTS

02:04:56.922 --> 02:04:57.923
AND THE USE OF CROWD CONTROL

02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:59.992
WEAPONS PRIMARILY WITH

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:01.293
PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:02.428
FIRST I WANTED TO SHARE A FEW

02:05:02.494 --> 02:05:04.997
BROADER POINT. ONE IS THAT

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:06.732
PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS ARE

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:08.133
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:10.035
OF THE DEMCRATIC PROCESS IN

02:05:10.102 --> 02:05:11.136
THIS COUNTRY IS A

02:05:11.203 --> 02:05:12.805
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

02:05:12.872 --> 02:05:16.342
ADVOCATE NOTABLE. CHIU INCITING

02:05:16.408 --> 02:05:18.410
PROTESTS THE VAST MAJORITY ARE

02:05:18.477 --> 02:05:20.746
PEACEFUL AND EVEN WHEN PROTESTS

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:22.314
TURNED VIOLENT THE VAST

02:05:22.381 --> 02:05:24.783
MAJORITY OF PROTESTERS IN THOSE

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.552
CROWDS ARE STILL PEACEFUL. THE

02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:28.254
MERE FACT THAT A DEMONSTRATION

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.089
IS BEING ILLEGAL OR THERE ARE

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:31.523
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VIOLENT

02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:33.592
DOES NOT JUSTIFY DISBURSING THE

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:37.796
ENTIRE ASSEMBLY. OR USING CROWD

02:05:37.863 --> 02:05:40.032
CONTROL WEAPONS. THIRD THE MOST

02:05:40.099 --> 02:05:41.367
EFFECTIVE METHOD TO PREVENT

02:05:41.433 --> 02:05:43.235
VIOLENCE IN PROTEST TO ENGAGE

02:05:43.302 --> 02:05:45.337
IN NEGOTIATIONS AND OPEN

02:05:45.404 --> 02:05:46.839
DIALOGUE BETWEEN PROTESTERS AND

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:48.674
LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE USE OF

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:50.175
THESE CAR CONTROL WEAPONS

02:05:50.242 --> 02:05:52.344
ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT WHEN

02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:54.013
DEALING WITH GENUINE AN

02:05:54.079 --> 02:05:55.214
IMMINENT THREAT TO SAFETY OF

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.482
PEOPLE PRESENT. AND THE ONLY

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:59.018
OTHER OUT OTHER OPTIONS HAVE

02:05:59.084 --> 02:05:59.985
BEEN ATTEMPTED. ON CROWD

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:01.754
CONTROL WEAPONS ARE DEPLOYED

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.255
THERE ARE IMPORTANT GUIDELINE.

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:05.391
THEY MUST BE NECESSARY THERE

02:06:05.457 --> 02:06:06.725
YOU THIRTY PROPORTIONATE AND

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.360
TARGETED AND IT MUST NOT BE

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:11.263
MISUSED. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:12.631
NOT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:15.000
PAST YEAR. I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY

02:06:15.067 --> 02:06:16.368
PROTEST BUT I STUDIED WITH THE

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.370
USE OF CROWD CONTROL WEAPONS

02:06:18.437 --> 02:06:20.072
HAS DE ESCALATED TENSIONS. OR

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:24.209
MADE THE SITUATION FAVOR. IT

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:25.744
OFTEN DOES QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:26.478
I'VE WORKED WITH MANY MANY

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:28.547
COLLEAGUES ACTED ON BEHALF OF

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:30.916
PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.

02:06:30.983 --> 02:06:32.217
HELP AFFECT THE OF CONTROL

02:06:32.284 --> 02:06:33.519
WEAPONS. MOST RECENTLY

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:34.620
PUBLISHED A REPORT ON THE USE

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:37.189
OF GENETIC IMPACT PROJECTILES

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:39.091
COME SOMETIMES CALLED RUBBER

02:06:39.158 --> 02:06:40.025
BULLETS. SO THERE ARE MUCH MORE

02:06:40.092 --> 02:06:41.860
THAN THAT. THE REPORT IS CALLED

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:44.863
SHOT IN THE HEAD AND FIND A

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:45.431
HUNDRED FIFTEEN PEOPLE WITH

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:46.899
SIGNIFICANT HEAD INJURIES.

02:06:46.966 --> 02:06:49.268
JUMPED AFTER THE KILLING OF

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:50.169
GEORGE FOUR EIGHT IN TWENTY

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:53.572
TWENTY. MANY OF THEM WERE IN

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:54.740
CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE WELCOME TO

02:06:54.807 --> 02:06:56.108
SEE THE VISUAL INVESTIGATION

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:57.276
FOR YOURSELF YOU CAN GOOGLE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:07:00.346
SHOT IN THE HEAD AND PHR. THERE

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:01.413
ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.048
RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND HAPPY TO

02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:04.750
SHARE WITH YOU. OUR RESEARCH

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:06.518
SHOWS THAT WHEN CRAPPIE BUT

02:07:06.585 --> 02:07:08.053
WEAPONS ARE USED UNNECESSARILY

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:09.922
DISPROPORTIONATELY AND WHEN

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:11.724
THEIR VIEWS. WE SEE MORE

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:13.792
INJURIES DISABILITIES AND EVEN

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:17.029
DEATH AND THIS IS A MONTH ON

02:07:17.096 --> 02:07:19.264
ARMED CIVILIANS. PERFECTLY

02:07:19.331 --> 02:07:20.466
RUBBER BULLETS AND ALL OTHER

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:21.400
CONNECTICUT IMPACT PROJECTILES

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:22.868
ARE DANGEROUS WHEN USED IN

02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:25.871
CROWDS. AT SHORT RANGES AND AT

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:28.107
LONG RANGES AT ANY RANGE. AND

02:07:28.173 --> 02:07:30.275
TEAR GAS IF YOU SO PERVASIVELY

02:07:30.342 --> 02:07:31.844
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND

STANDARD YOU CAN'T SIMPLY SAY-

02:24:56.854 --> 02:24:57.822
SOMEBODY THREW A ROCK AND SO

02:24:57.889 --> 02:24:59.857
WE'RE GOING TO SPRAY RUBBER

02:24:59.924 --> 02:25:01.759
BULLETS ACROSS THIS CROWD I

02:25:01.826 --> 02:25:03.628
MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:05.296
INAPPROPRIATE BUT YOU KNOW THAT

02:25:05.363 --> 02:25:07.799
THERE CANNOT BE GIVEN HOW WOULD

02:25:07.865 --> 02:25:10.101
YOU SUGGEST THAT THAT BE- TAKEN

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:12.470
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE- I'VE

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:13.738
ACTUALLY HAD PROJECT-

02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:16.574
PROJECTILES THROWN AT ME. IN A

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:18.810
SITUATION AND I'M TELLING YOU.

02:25:18.876 --> 02:25:21.412
IT FEELS EXTREMELY. THREATENING

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:22.713
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THOSE

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:24.449
PROJECTILES EVEN THOUGH LAW

02:25:24.515 --> 02:25:25.416
ENFORCEMENT DOES HAVE

02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:26.851
EQUIPMENT. TO PROTECT

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:29.787
THEMSELVES- BUT THAT. IS STILL

02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:31.856
VERY DANGEROUS VERY UGLY SET OF

02:25:31.923 --> 02:25:34.058
CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT HAVE TO BE

02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:36.227
QUELLED AND HAVE TO BE TOLD

02:25:36.294 --> 02:25:36.994
THAT THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE

02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:39.464
BEHAVIOR. AND SO THAT'S REALLY

02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:41.566
THE MISSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:25:41.632 --> 02:25:42.366
WHEN THEY GO UNDER THE

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:44.902
CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS A TO STOP

02:25:44.969 --> 02:25:46.070
THEM FROM PROTESTING OR SENDING

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:48.606
THEIR- THEIR MESSAGE OF-

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:50.575
DISAGREEMENT WITH WHATEVER.

02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:54.011
SITUATION EXISTS IT'S TO KEEP

02:25:54.078 --> 02:25:56.380
THINGS PEACEFUL. I WANT PEOPLE.

02:25:56.447 --> 02:25:57.882
YOU CAN LAUGH ALL YOU WANT BUT

02:25:57.949 --> 02:25:59.383
IT'S FUNNY WHEN SOMEONE STOLE A

02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:01.152
BOTTLE AT U. S. NINETY WHEN

02:26:01.219 --> 02:26:04.422
YOU. GOING TO ACCESS TO MY-

02:26:04.489 --> 02:26:05.690
REQUESTION BUT IT'S ALSO NOT

02:26:05.756 --> 02:26:06.791
THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE SHOT AT

02:26:06.858 --> 02:26:08.826
PERFECTLY INNOCENT BYSTANDERS

02:26:08.893 --> 02:26:11.229
IN LOSING THEIR ICE. ALL RIGHT

02:26:11.295 --> 02:26:13.231
SO IT IS A GIVE AND TAKE AND I

02:26:13.297 --> 02:26:15.066
HAVE MET WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:26:15.133 --> 02:26:16.701
OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS

02:26:16.767 --> 02:26:18.136
BILL AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO

02:26:18.202 --> 02:26:19.737
THAT AND YOU SHOULD BUT TO

02:26:19.804 --> 02:26:21.339
SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE AN OFFICER

02:26:21.405 --> 02:26:22.673
IS AFRAID BECAUSE SOMEBODY

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.841
THREW A ROCK AT HIM THAT HE

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.476
SHOULD BE ABLE. OR SHE SHOULD

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:27.178
BE ABLE TO INDISCRIMINATELY.

02:26:27.245 --> 02:26:29.447
SPRAY RUBBER BULLETS. AT A

02:26:29.514 --> 02:26:31.849
CROWD. IT IS OFFENSIVE TO MY

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:33.417
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

02:26:33.484 --> 02:26:35.887
PROTEST. THIS IS A SPECIALIZED

02:26:35.953 --> 02:26:38.556
AFRAID. AND I WILL TELL YOU

02:26:38.623 --> 02:26:39.991
THAT THEY'RE ACTING OKAY. HALF

02:26:40.057 --> 02:26:41.159
OF OTHER PEOPLE AND I DON'T

02:26:41.225 --> 02:26:42.460
THINK THAT WAS VERY FAIR EITHER

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:44.595
AND- I JUST WANT TO SEE THE-

02:26:44.662 --> 02:26:49.033
LIGHT. I DO AGREE WITH. THE

02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:49.567
FACT THAT WE NEED TO WORK

02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:50.201
THROUGH THIS ISSUE. BUT I THINK

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:51.736
IT DOES APPROACH AND THIS BILL

02:26:51.802 --> 02:26:53.204
BEFORE ME. THIS TO EXTREME A

02:26:53.271 --> 02:26:55.239
VERY VERY AMBIGUOUS ON A NUMBER

02:26:55.306 --> 02:26:56.641
OF FRONTS. AND I CAN TELL THAT

02:26:56.707 --> 02:26:59.544
YOU'RE NOT IN A- MOOD RIGHT NOW

02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:01.546
TO DISCUSS OKAY ASSEMBLY SIDE

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.481
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYMORE. I

02:27:03.548 --> 02:27:04.849
AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING

02:27:04.916 --> 02:27:06.184
AFRAID AT THAT IS WHAT I HEARD

02:27:06.250 --> 02:27:07.685
YOU SAY IT IS A VERY SCARY

02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:08.953
SITUATION AND I'M SORRY IF I

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:10.688
USE MY WORDS TO SAY IF AN

02:27:10.755 --> 02:27:11.756
OFFICER IS AFRAID I DON'T THINK

02:27:11.822 --> 02:27:13.457
THAT'S AN EXCUSE I STILL DON'T

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:15.993
THINK IT'S AN EXCUSE. SO I WILL

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:17.461
BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU

02:27:17.528 --> 02:27:19.263
ARE IN WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS NOT

02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:21.098
AMBIGUOUS IT'S VERY SPECIFIC ON

02:27:21.165 --> 02:27:22.867
WHAT OFFICERS NEED TO DO. TO DE

02:27:22.934 --> 02:27:24.936
ESCALATE AND TO WARN THAT THIS

02:27:25.002 --> 02:27:26.204
TYPE OF USE OF FORCE IS GOING

02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:27.371
TO BE USED IF THERE IS A

02:27:27.438 --> 02:27:28.873
DIFFERENT WAY TO APPROACH THAT

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:30.575
I'D BE HAPPY I'VE BEEN WORKING

02:27:30.641 --> 02:27:31.175
ON THIS BILL FOR TWO YEARS I'D

02:27:31.242 --> 02:27:32.777
BE HAPPY TO HEAR IT. BUT YOU

02:27:32.843 --> 02:27:34.979
KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE WE'RE AT

02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:37.248
RIGHT HERE IN AND- NO BILL LIKE

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:39.150
THIS HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET

02:27:39.217 --> 02:27:39.584
THROUGH IN THE STATE

02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:41.085
LEGISLATURE AND THIS IS WHY.

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:43.354
BUT WE HAVE TO PROTECT INNOCENT

02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:45.923
BYSTANDERS AT PEACEFUL PROTEST

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:47.925
IT IS JUST TO FUNDAMENTAL BEEN

02:27:47.992 --> 02:27:50.861
TO ALLOW WHAT HAPPENED THIS

02:27:50.928 --> 02:27:51.395
SUMMER TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:53.331
AGAIN. THE QUESTIONS WERE

02:27:53.397 --> 02:27:56.601
SELECTED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER

02:27:56.667 --> 02:27:57.101
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

02:27:57.168 --> 02:28:00.104
MEMBERS. YOU MAKE CLOSENESS

02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:02.240
GONZALEZ I JUST WANT TO POINT

02:28:02.306 --> 02:28:03.574
OUT THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS

02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:05.142
THAT ACTUALLY WHEN THESE TYPES

02:28:05.209 --> 02:28:06.277
OF WEAPONS ARE DEPLOYED IT

02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:08.479
ACTUALLY ESCALATES THE VIOLENCE

02:28:08.546 --> 02:28:09.847
SO TO SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:11.949
USED TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE WOULD

02:28:12.016 --> 02:28:13.884
BE COUNTERINTUITIVE. AND THE

02:28:13.951 --> 02:28:15.486
TRUTH IS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW

02:28:15.553 --> 02:28:18.990
MUCH. VIOLENCE ARE HOW HOW HOW

02:28:19.056 --> 02:28:20.791
MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING INJURED

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:22.360
BY THE USE OF THESE LEFT LESS

02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:25.129
THAN WE LEGAL. LESS THAN LETHAL

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:26.664
WEAPONS BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN

02:28:26.731 --> 02:28:29.133
GET HAVE THAT DATA THAT IS AN

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:29.734
IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THIS BILL

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:31.669
AS WELL. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:34.305
THIS. A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE

02:28:34.372 --> 02:28:36.374
THIS SUMMER HAVE BEEN.

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.075
PERMANENTLY MAIMED BECAUSE THEY

02:28:38.142 --> 02:28:39.277
THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHOW

02:28:39.343 --> 02:28:40.177
UP AT THE PEACEFUL

02:28:40.244 --> 02:28:42.380
DEMONSTRATION THAT THAT MAYBE

02:28:42.446 --> 02:28:44.715
GOT TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND

02:28:44.782 --> 02:28:47.051
INVOICE THEIR THEIR RIGHT TO

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:49.053
TAKE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT IN

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:50.187
THE SYSTEM BUT THEY FELT HURT

02:28:50.254 --> 02:28:53.891
BY. THAT AS SOMEBODY WHO FROM

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:55.993
THE DAY MY KIDS WERE BEING HELD

02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:57.495
HAVE TAKEN THEM TO PROTESTS

02:28:57.561 --> 02:29:00.831
HAVE TAKEN THEM TO ACTIONS. IT

02:29:00.898 --> 02:29:04.068
IS EXTREMELY SCARY TO SEE WHAT

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:06.270
HAPPENED THE SUMMER TO INNOCENT

02:29:06.337 --> 02:29:08.306
BYSTANDERS NOT PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:29:08.372 --> 02:29:09.573
SHOOTING AT THE POLICE BUT

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.542
PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE TO EXPRESS

02:29:11.609 --> 02:29:12.910
THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

02:29:12.977 --> 02:29:14.879
WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE

02:29:14.945 --> 02:29:16.514
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE

02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:18.649
TO WORK WITH ANYONE WHO HAS. A

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:20.651
SUGGESTION I HAVE TAKEN EVERY

02:29:20.718 --> 02:29:21.952
MEETING I WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE

02:29:22.019 --> 02:29:24.955
EVERY MEETING- WITH ANY SECTORS

02:29:25.022 --> 02:29:26.324
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I HAVE AND I

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:28.125
MADE CHANGES THAT. YOU KNOW

02:29:28.192 --> 02:29:30.261
THEY ASK FOR SO AT THIS POINT I

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:31.529
JUST THINK THIS IS A REALLY

02:29:31.595 --> 02:29:33.264
IMPORTANT- STANDARD THAT WE

02:29:33.331 --> 02:29:35.299
NEED TO SET IN AND I LOOK

02:29:35.366 --> 02:29:37.168
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ANYONE

02:29:37.234 --> 02:29:39.704
WHO WANTS TO WORK. WITH ME ON.

02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:42.573
THANK YOU- BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:48.512
IS VERY- SENSITIVE ISSUE. BUT.

02:29:48.579 --> 02:29:49.046
IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM MY

02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:54.352
PERSPECTIVE- WHEN I WAS A YOUNG

02:29:54.418 --> 02:29:56.520
REGGIE JONES SAWYER LIVING IN

02:29:56.587 --> 02:29:59.890
LOS ANGELES. WITH A POLICE

02:29:59.957 --> 02:30:02.727
CHIEF NAMED DARYL GATES. WHO

02:30:02.793 --> 02:30:05.129
SAID THAT USING A CHARCOAL. WAS

02:30:05.196 --> 02:30:09.767
AN APPROPRIATE WAY. TO DEFEND

02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:10.267
FOR POLICE OUT TO DEFEND

02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:12.703
HIMSELF THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:14.839
AMERICAN MEN WHO DIE BECAUSE

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:16.340
YOU HAD A CHIEF OF POLICE WHO

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:18.309
BASICALLY SAID WE HAD AN

02:30:18.376 --> 02:30:21.512
ANATOMY. HE WANTED TO AND IF WE

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:26.283
HAD AN ANATOMY. THAT CAUSED US

02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:26.784
TO DIE WHEN THEY DID THE

02:30:26.851 --> 02:30:30.154
CHUCKLE. AND COULDN'T SEE THE

02:30:30.221 --> 02:30:35.226
HUMANITY. N. A. A POLICE ACTION

02:30:35.292 --> 02:30:36.494
THAT RESULTED IN SOMEONE'S

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:39.063
DEATH M. I HAD DISCUSSIONS

02:30:39.130 --> 02:30:41.665
ABOUT THINK ABOUT THAT THAT WAS

02:30:41.732 --> 02:30:43.100
LIKE THE LATE EIGHTIES AND

02:30:43.167 --> 02:30:46.070
NINETIES. I THINK MISTER GIBSON

02:30:46.137 --> 02:30:52.643
JUST HAD UP. WHAT YEARS IS

02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:53.210
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FROM THE

02:30:53.277 --> 02:30:55.346
LATE EIGHTIES TOLD NOW THAT

02:30:55.413 --> 02:30:58.115
SOMEHOW WE STRUGGLED WITH IT.

02:30:58.182 --> 02:31:01.085
SO I COMMEND YOU FOR BRING IT

02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:02.953
HERE NOW BECAUSE- EVEN WITH

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:06.490
THIS DISCUSSION. WE NEED TO

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:08.325
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE DO AND WE

02:31:08.392 --> 02:31:10.861
SHOULDN'T TAKE. TWENTY THIRTY

02:31:10.928 --> 02:31:15.099
YEARS. TO SOLVE IT WE NEED TO

02:31:15.166 --> 02:31:20.738
SOLVE IT NOW- AND I KNOW.

02:31:20.805 --> 02:31:21.906
THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THIS

02:31:21.972 --> 02:31:23.574
COMMITTEE USED TO TRAIN. THAT I

02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:27.611
WISH WERE BACK AT THE ACADEMY

02:31:27.678 --> 02:31:30.414
TRAINING PEOPLE ON THE USE. OF

02:31:30.481 --> 02:31:31.916
THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE

02:31:31.982 --> 02:31:33.584
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

02:31:33.651 --> 02:31:37.755
D. E. DO YOU SPEND A TRAINEE

02:31:37.822 --> 02:31:38.322
AND HOW FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:40.257
READING. HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATE

02:31:40.324 --> 02:31:45.262
ENOUGH. MORE UPDATED. TO TWENTY

02:31:45.329 --> 02:31:49.033
TWENTY ONE STANDARDS- SO THAT

02:31:49.099 --> 02:31:51.202
BOTH SIDES ARE SAFE AND BOTH

02:31:51.268 --> 02:31:52.670
SIDES UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO

02:31:52.736 --> 02:31:57.942
BE DONE- AND THAT BOTH SIDES

02:31:58.008 --> 02:32:00.945
UNDERSTAND DE ESCALATION. AND

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:03.180
HOW TO WORK BECAUSE CHANGE

02:32:03.247 --> 02:32:05.282
OBVIOUS CHANGED A LOT FROM WHEN

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:07.084
LAW ENFORCEMENT USED TO SIX

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:08.919
GERMAN SHEPHERDS ON MY PEOPLE.

02:32:08.986 --> 02:32:11.522
IT'S CHANGED THAT STORE FIRE

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:14.124
HOSES. ON BLACK PEOPLE IT'S

02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:17.728
CHANGED CHANGED DRAMATICALLY

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:19.396
AND THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:22.733
METHODOLOGY BACKED ON. WHEN

02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:25.569

03:39:43.770 --> 03:39:45.705

03:46:13.493 --> 03:46:15.194
DAILY ON THE LANGUAGE HOWEVER

03:46:15.261 --> 03:46:16.930
THAT WHATEVER CLARITY IS DEEMED

03:46:16.996 --> 03:46:21.935
NECESSARY. EXCELLENT THANK YOU

I THINK THIS IS REALLY AND- IN

03:46:36.449 --> 03:46:37.116
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACT IN THE

03:46:37.183 --> 03:46:38.584
JOB SYSTEM SOMETHING THAT IS.

03:46:38.651 --> 03:46:40.086
AS YOU MENTIONED YOUR OPENING

03:46:40.153 --> 03:46:42.822
SIGNIFICANTLY LACKING AND THE

03:46:42.889 --> 03:46:44.457
OPPORTUNITY THAT THE U. S.

03:46:44.524 --> 03:46:46.426
JUSTICE SYSTEM PROVIDES FOR AN

03:46:46.492 --> 03:46:47.627
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL TO COME

03:46:47.694 --> 03:46:49.462
BEFORE THE COURT AND BE HEARD

03:46:49.529 --> 03:46:49.929
AGAIN AS A FUNDAMENTAL

03:46:49.996 --> 03:46:52.398
PRINCIPLE THAT IS. PART OF WHAT

03:46:52.465 --> 03:46:55.134
I THINK MAKES OUR SYSTEM SO

03:46:55.201 --> 03:46:56.536
ARTFUL IS THAT WE DON'T

03:46:56.602 --> 03:46:57.503
INCARCERATE PEOPLE NEVER LOOK

03:46:57.570 --> 03:47:01.007
BACK AND- AND SO YOUR EXTENDING

03:47:01.074 --> 03:47:02.442
THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN.

03:47:02.508 --> 03:47:04.744
POTENTIALLY IMPACTED BY BIAS

03:47:04.811 --> 03:47:05.912
AND A LACK OF JUSTICE I THINK

03:47:05.979 --> 03:47:09.048
IS REALLY WONDERFUL MY CONCERN

03:47:09.115 --> 03:47:09.849

AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON

03:47:12.118 --> 03:47:14.387
THAT MY CONCERN IS REALLY WITH-

03:47:14.454 --> 03:47:16.122
THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS AS MANY

03:47:16.189 --> 03:47:18.758
OF US KNOW THE COURTS ARE WERE

03:47:18.825 --> 03:47:20.526
OVERBURDENED PRIOR TO COPE ED

03:47:20.593 --> 03:47:21.861
AND HAVING A HARD TIME MEETING

03:47:21.928 --> 03:47:23.696
JUSTICE BECAUSE OF THAT. VAST

03:47:23.763 --> 03:47:25.164
NUMBER OF CASES BEFORE THEM

03:47:25.231 --> 03:47:27.000
THAT'S ONLY EXACERBATED WITH

03:47:27.066 --> 03:47:28.434
THE COVERED CRISIS BUT I DON'T

03:47:28.501 --> 03:47:29.869
EVEN AFTER WE GET THROUGH CO

03:47:29.936 --> 03:47:31.004
THAT I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE

03:47:31.070 --> 03:47:33.973
TO SEE OVERBURDENED COURTS. AND

03:47:34.040 --> 03:47:35.975
TO OPEN THIS UP AND WANTS TO

03:47:36.042 --> 03:47:37.343
EVERY SINGLE PERSON

03:47:37.410 --> 03:47:40.780
INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA WHO

03:47:40.847 --> 03:47:41.347
MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED BIAS.

03:47:41.414 --> 03:47:42.415
COULD POTENTIALLY OVERWHELM THE

03:47:42.482 --> 03:47:43.583
COURTS AND I UNDERSTAND THE

03:47:43.649 --> 03:47:47.353
STANDARDS ACTUALLY. ACHIEVE THE

03:47:47.420 --> 03:47:49.956
END RESULT IS HIGH BUT YOU MAY

03:47:50.023 --> 03:47:52.725

03:47:53.926 --> 03:47:55.895
PETITIONS. WHICH THEN THEY

03:47:55.962 --> 03:47:58.364
DESERVE TO BE ANALYZED AND

03:47:58.431 --> 03:47:59.232
THOUGHTFULLY REVIEWED AND GIVEN

03:47:59.298 --> 03:48:01.300
THEIR MOMENT IN COURT. AND I

03:48:01.367 --> 03:48:02.702
DON'T KNOW HOW THE COURT SYSTEM

03:48:02.769 --> 03:48:04.303
WOULD DO THAT IF WE WERE TO

03:48:04.370 --> 03:48:06.105
JUST OPEN THIS TO EVERY PERSON

03:48:06.172 --> 03:48:07.073
RETROACTIVELY AND I'M

PHASE IN. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

03:48:26.359 --> 03:48:27.560

OVERBURDEN OUR COURT SYSTEM ONE

03:48:28.895 --> 03:48:30.196
THAT SPENT ELEVEN YEARS THE

03:48:30.263 --> 03:48:30.963

COUNCIL WHICH MAKES IT NOT ONLY

03:53:47.713 --> 03:53:49.882
A BETTER BILL BUT- MOST

03:53:49.949 --> 03:53:53.786
IMPORTANT- IT GIVES ME- SOME

03:53:53.853 --> 03:53:55.788
CONFIDENCE THAT SOME KIND OF

03:53:55.855 --> 03:53:57.289
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WILL COME

03:53:57.356 --> 03:54:00.760

TOWARD THIS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

03:54:09.802 --> 03:54:12.571
THIS HAPPEN. AND THE REASON WHY

03:54:12.638 --> 03:54:14.440

03:54:14.507 --> 03:54:17.610
GOOD REASON- RACIAL INJUSTICE

03:54:17.676 --> 03:54:19.412
AFRICAN AMERICANS. BUDGET IS

03:54:19.478 --> 03:54:21.347

WAS INVOLVED IN. AND THEY MAY

03:54:40.699 --> 03:54:42.635
ALL BE OVERTURNED BECAUSE OF

03:54:42.701 --> 03:54:45.938
THIS I THINK EVERY D. A. N.

03:54:46.005 --> 03:54:48.941
CALIFORNIA IF NOT THE COUNTRY

03:54:49.008 --> 03:54:51.310

RACIAL SLURS AND WAS RECORDED

03:55:05.157 --> 03:55:08.260

03:55:08.327 --> 03:55:10.262
AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE

03:55:10.329 --> 03:55:12.832

AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE TREATED

03:55:19.839 --> 03:55:22.208
UNJUSTLY THIS WILL HELP MAKE

03:55:22.274 --> 03:55:23.409
SURE THAT NONE OF THEIR CASES

03:55:23.476 --> 03:55:25.211
BE OVERTURNED AND HOW MUCH HOW

03:55:25.277 --> 03:55:26.612

EVERYBODY IN A SHOULD BE TESTED

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WORDS TO

USE TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENS.

04:06:48.593 --> 04:06:50.195
WHEN SOMEONE GOES THROUGH THE

04:06:50.262 --> 04:06:52.664
PROCESS OF HAVING A RAPE KIT

04:06:52.731 --> 04:06:53.231

BODY. TO THEN SAY THAT THOSE

04:06:56.635 --> 04:06:59.104
TESTS SHOULD NOT BE TESTED.

04:06:59.171 --> 04:07:01.106
BECAUSE WELL THERE'S OTHER

04:07:01.173 --> 04:07:02.974
THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TESTED IS.

04:07:03.041 --> 04:07:05.410
SHOCKING TO ME IT SHOULD ALL BE

04:07:05.477 --> 04:07:07.712
TESTED AND I AM I WOULD LIKE TO

04:07:07.779 --> 04:07:09.347
JOIN A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL I

04:07:09.414 --> 04:07:11.116
AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

04:07:11.183 --> 04:07:11.883
THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IS

04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:13.451
PRIORITIZING A BILL BEING

04:07:13.518 --> 04:07:15.754
CARRIED BY MISS DOLLY WHICH

04:07:15.820 --> 04:07:16.588
WILL ENSURE THAT WE FULLY

04:07:16.655 --> 04:07:19.691
FUNDS. THE RAPE TEST PROCESS SO

04:07:19.758 --> 04:07:20.892
THAT THERE ARE DOCTORS

04:07:20.959 --> 04:07:23.562
AVAILABLE TO DO THIS FOR WOMEN

04:07:23.628 --> 04:07:25.163
THAT NEED IT BECAUSE THERE ARE

04:07:25.230 --> 04:07:26.565
MANY AREAS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

04:07:26.631 --> 04:07:27.966
YOU CAN'T GET THIS DONE IN A

04:07:28.033 --> 04:07:29.668
QUICK FASHION WOMEN SIT IN

04:07:29.734 --> 04:07:31.203
THEIR CLOTHING THAT THEY HAVE

04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:33.772
BEEN RAPED IN FOR DAYS. BEFORE

04:07:33.838 --> 04:07:36.641
THEY GET THIS. PROCESS DONE AND

04:07:36.708 --> 04:07:38.743
SO IT IS INCUMBENT UPON EACH

04:07:38.810 --> 04:07:40.111
AND EVERYONE OF US TO ENSURE

04:07:40.178 --> 04:07:40.912
THAT THOSE VICTIMS ARE

04:07:40.979 --> 04:07:42.981
SUPPORTED. THAT THEIR TESTS ARE

04:07:43.048 --> 04:07:45.517
RUN AND THAT THEY GET THE

04:07:45.584 --> 04:07:47.886
JUSTICE THEY DESERVE THANK YOU.

04:07:47.953 --> 04:07:52.624
THANK YOU MR CLARK. YOU KNOW

04:07:52.691 --> 04:07:54.559
JUST BECAUSE A D. A. DECIDED

04:07:54.626 --> 04:07:57.195
THAT. THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE

04:07:57.262 --> 04:07:59.130
THEY DIDN'T NEED TO PASS THAT

04:07:59.197 --> 04:08:01.132
TO LOOK AT THE DNA IS NOT A

04:08:01.199 --> 04:08:02.934
GOOD REASON FOR ME EVEN IF

04:08:03.001 --> 04:08:06.104
PRISON PERSON PLEADS GUILTY.

04:08:06.171 --> 04:08:07.005
SOME PEOPLE FEEL ALL THE

04:08:07.072 --> 04:08:08.773
EVIDENCE IS SO MUCH AGAINST ME

04:08:08.840 --> 04:08:10.875
I'LL JUST BE GUILTY BECAUSE

04:08:10.942 --> 04:08:13.445
BOB. I MEAN THAT HAPPENS AND SO

04:08:13.511 --> 04:08:14.779
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

04:08:14.846 --> 04:08:17.048
TEST EVERY SINGLE. ONE AND I

04:08:17.115 --> 04:08:18.817
THINK I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

04:08:18.883 --> 04:08:19.618
THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE

04:08:19.684 --> 04:08:21.586
AGAINST IT. NOW THEY DO HAVE A

04:08:21.653 --> 04:08:28.226
CONCERN. I FRANKLY CAN'T. LOOK

04:08:28.293 --> 04:08:30.595
LOCAL AGENCIES ARE GOING TO BE

04:08:30.662 --> 04:08:31.062
ABLE TO SET THEIR OWN

04:08:31.129 --> 04:08:33.231
PRIORITIES AND I DON'T THINK

04:08:33.298 --> 04:08:35.166
THAT THEY WILL NEGLECT THE

04:08:35.233 --> 04:08:37.435
CURRENT CASE BECAUSE OF THE S.

04:08:37.502 --> 04:08:39.738
AND FRANKLY THEY NEGLECTED THE

04:08:39.804 --> 04:08:41.439
OTHER LOVE WHERE WE TELL THEM

04:08:41.506 --> 04:08:43.275
THEY HAD TO REPORT ON ALL THE

04:08:43.341 --> 04:08:45.610
CASES THAT THEY HAVE AT ALL OF

04:08:45.677 --> 04:08:47.579
THE KIDS THAT THEY HADN'T DONE

04:08:47.646 --> 04:08:48.613
THEY'LL DO THEIR OWN THING

04:08:48.680 --> 04:08:50.548
THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT SAYS

04:08:50.615 --> 04:08:52.484
THEY HAVE TO GO TO JAIL THE

04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:54.753
SOMETHING WASN'T TESTED BY THE

04:08:54.819 --> 04:08:57.055
DEADLINE IN THE BILL. SO I

04:08:57.122 --> 04:08:59.190
THINK IT IS DISINGENUOUS TO

04:08:59.257 --> 04:09:00.191
MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND I HOPE

04:09:00.258 --> 04:09:04.462
THE- THE- PUBLIC DEFENDERS WILL

04:09:04.529 --> 04:09:05.997
REVERSE YOUR POSITION ON THIS

04:09:06.064 --> 04:09:08.066
SCALE I ALSO THINK IT'S

04:09:08.133 --> 04:09:10.068
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE MONEY

04:09:10.135 --> 04:09:11.703
TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES SO THEY

04:09:11.770 --> 04:09:14.673
CAN DO THIS THIS IS A YEAR

04:09:14.739 --> 04:09:16.007
COULD ALLOCATE WHATEVER

THE STATE AND WE HAVE MANY OF

04:37:09.012 --> 04:37:12.315
THEM. YEAH WHERE- THEY HAVE

PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:37:20.090 --> 04:37:22.158
SERVICES FOR AND SO THEY DON'T

04:37:22.225 --> 04:37:25.195
REALLY HAVE. AGENCIES THAT ARE

04:37:25.261 --> 04:37:27.163
RIGHT NEXT TO THEM THE BUT UP

04:37:27.230 --> 04:37:28.832
NEXT TO A MISSILE THAT PUTS HIM

04:37:28.898 --> 04:37:30.734
AT A VERY EXTREME A

04:37:30.800 --> 04:37:32.869
DISADVANTAGE IN FINANCIAL

04:37:32.936 --> 04:37:33.470
PROBLEMS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE

04:37:33.536 --> 04:37:35.872
THEY'RE FUNDING. IS ALSO NOT

04:37:35.939 --> 04:37:38.608
THAT STRONG AND I JUST I CAN'T

04:37:38.675 --> 04:37:40.276
SUPPORT THIS. BILL BECAUSE IT

04:37:40.343 --> 04:37:42.579
ALSO PRESUPPOSES MISTRUST LAW

04:37:42.645 --> 04:37:44.848
ENFORCEMENT. HAVING DONE THESE

04:37:44.914 --> 04:37:46.483
KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN

04:37:46.549 --> 04:37:49.452
MY OWN AGENCY. FOR A LONG TIME

04:37:49.519 --> 04:37:51.554
I COULD TELL YOU THAT- THIRD

04:37:51.621 --> 04:37:52.889
THERE'S STRONG INTEREST IN

04:37:52.956 --> 04:37:54.557
GETTING TO THE TRUTH.

04:37:54.624 --> 04:37:58.161
INDEPENDENT OF- SAME AGENCY

04:37:58.228 --> 04:38:00.630
CONNECTION SO I CAN I'M SORRY

04:38:00.697 --> 04:38:01.865
BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. THANK

04:38:01.931 --> 04:38:03.666
YOU YOU MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION

04:38:03.733 --> 04:38:06.436
I WOULD YEAH- SO I THINK THERE

04:38:06.503 --> 04:38:07.937
ARE TWO POINTS THAT BROUGHT

04:38:08.004 --> 04:38:09.873
THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE

04:38:09.939 --> 04:38:12.242
OPPOSITION AND BY MY SUPPORTER

04:38:12.308 --> 04:38:14.144
FRANKLY THAT SHE FROM. WEST

04:38:14.210 --> 04:38:16.413
SACRAMENTO TALKING ABOUT LARGE

04:38:16.479 --> 04:38:18.681
URBAN AGENCIES THINK OF L. A.

04:38:18.748 --> 04:38:20.517
P. D. L. A. COUNTY SHERIFF THEY

04:38:20.583 --> 04:38:21.351
HAVE EXPERTISE DOESN'T MAKE

04:38:21.418 --> 04:38:22.852
SENSE RELIC SHERIFF TO BRING

04:38:22.919 --> 04:38:24.854
IN. CITY OF PALMDALE I'M NOT

04:38:24.921 --> 04:38:25.355
SURE THEY HAVE A POLICE

04:38:25.422 --> 04:38:27.290
DEPARTMENT SO. WE'RE WILLING TO

04:38:27.357 --> 04:38:29.025
THINK ABOUT THAT INTERACTION

04:38:29.092 --> 04:38:30.460
BUT HAVING ANOTHER POLICE

04:38:30.527 --> 04:38:32.062
DEPARTMENT PART OF IT I THINK

04:38:32.128 --> 04:38:33.797
THIS BRINGS ABOUT MORE PUBLIC

04:38:33.863 --> 04:38:35.331
TRUST THAT THE UMPIRE CALLING

04:38:35.398 --> 04:38:37.434
BALLS AND STRIKES ISN'T YOU

04:38:37.500 --> 04:38:40.637
KNOW LEAN ON ONE TEAM- IN THE

04:38:40.703 --> 04:38:43.106
RURAL AREAS TO I THINK THAT

04:38:43.173 --> 04:38:44.474
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL

04:38:44.541 --> 04:38:45.442
CERTAINLY LOOK AT THINKING

04:38:45.508 --> 04:38:47.777
ABOUT. THE DALAI DISTRICT UP

04:38:47.844 --> 04:38:48.745
THERE AND I'LL TURN US THERE'S

04:38:48.812 --> 04:38:50.013
NO JURISDICTION AROUND THE

04:38:50.080 --> 04:38:51.381
ATLANTA PROBABLY ISN'T ALTURAS

04:38:51.448 --> 04:38:53.583
POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT COUNT

04:38:53.650 --> 04:38:54.150
IT'S THE STATE'S THE COUNTY

04:38:54.217 --> 04:38:56.152
SHERIFF. SO I THINK THOSE ARE

04:38:56.219 --> 04:38:57.454
REASONABLE THINGS BUT I DO KNOW

04:38:57.520 --> 04:38:59.222
THIS THIS IS THE FUTURE OF

04:38:59.289 --> 04:39:00.757
POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT

04:39:00.824 --> 04:39:02.926
CALIFORNIA THE POLICE CHIEFS

04:39:02.992 --> 04:39:03.726
ARE SAYING WE WANT TO DO MORE

04:39:03.793 --> 04:39:05.662
OF THIS. THEY KNOW THAT THERE

04:39:05.728 --> 04:39:08.031
IS DISTRUST. MAYBE THERE

04:39:08.098 --> 04:39:09.332
SHOULDN'T BE AS YOU SAY BUT

04:39:09.399 --> 04:39:10.467
THERE IS COMMITTEE DISTRUST

04:39:10.533 --> 04:39:12.669
HAVING HAVING MORE INDEPENDENCE

04:39:12.735 --> 04:39:14.704
IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS BRINGS

04:39:14.771 --> 04:39:16.206
ABOUT I THINK A BETTER OUTCOME

04:39:16.272 --> 04:39:18.508
BRINGS ABOUT MORE COMMUNITY-

04:39:18.575 --> 04:39:21.611
BUYING INTO THE PROCESS AND SO

04:39:21.678 --> 04:39:22.946
THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS OUR

04:39:23.012 --> 04:39:24.280
STATE. AND THE MORE

04:39:24.347 --> 04:39:26.216
JURISDICTIONS THAT DO THIS

04:39:26.282 --> 04:39:27.851
WHETHER THEY I WOULD LIKE TO

04:39:27.917 --> 04:39:28.885
HAVE EVERY DEPARTMENT IN

04:39:28.952 --> 04:39:31.654
CALIFORNIA'S WE CAN GET 90% OR

04:39:31.721 --> 04:39:33.623
80% BUT I THINK IT'S A BIG A

04:39:33.690 --> 04:39:38.728
BIG VICTORY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

04:39:38.795 --> 04:39:40.230
AND TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

04:39:40.296 --> 04:39:45.468
YOU MR QUIRK. YEAH MY CONCERN

04:39:45.535 --> 04:39:48.004
IS THAT I DON'T SEE THIS

04:39:48.071 --> 04:39:50.273
ENGENDERING ANYMORE TRUST AND

04:39:50.340 --> 04:39:53.243
HERE'S WHY. THERE ARE ALREADY

04:39:53.309 --> 04:39:56.646
CONCERNS WHEN THE DA R.

04:39:56.713 --> 04:39:58.681
INVESTIGATES A POLICE OFFICER

04:39:58.748 --> 04:40:01.818
THAT HE OR SHE IS- PREJUDICE

04:40:01.885 --> 04:40:03.219
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GOOD

04:40:03.286 --> 04:40:05.588
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE.

04:40:05.655 --> 04:40:08.391
THERE ARE ALREADY CONCERNS-

PERFECT SYSTEM THIS WOULD

04:40:54.904 --> 04:40:57.307
IMPROVE THE PROCESS TO MAKE

04:40:57.373 --> 04:40:58.975
SURE THAT THE TRANSFER OF

04:40:59.042 --> 04:41:01.110

PURPOSE OF THE NOTIFICATION.

04:56:45.487 --> 04:56:48.190

04:57:04.773 --> 04:57:05.607
AND AS A YOUNG PERSON I

04:57:05.674 --> 04:57:07.409
DEFINITELY AND SYMPATHETIC TO

04:57:07.476 --> 04:57:09.211
MODERNIZING ANTIQUATED AND

04:57:09.278 --> 04:57:10.212
QUICK MENUS BUT I'M JUST

04:57:10.279 --> 04:57:11.580
WONDERING HOW OFTEN DO THEY

04:57:11.647 --> 04:57:13.415
HAVE TO DO THIS LET'S PUT IT

04:57:13.482 --> 04:57:15.083
THIS WAY IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S A-

04:57:15.150 --> 04:57:16.885
IT'S ENOUGH TO WHERE THE PRICE

04:57:16.952 --> 04:57:20.022
TAG. FOR THE FRESNO- SHERIFF'S

04:57:20.088 --> 04:57:22.057
DEPARTMENT IS VERY VERY HIGH

04:57:22.124 --> 04:57:23.825
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF

04:57:23.892 --> 04:57:26.228
THESE ACTIVITIES. THE BIRDS ARE

04:57:26.295 --> 04:57:28.697
ARE- TAKEN IT INTO THEIR

04:57:28.764 --> 04:57:31.767
CUSTODY. AND IT IS-

04:57:31.833 --> 04:57:35.804
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT- TO

04:57:35.871 --> 04:57:38.307
JUSTIFY 800-021-1000 DOLLAR

04:57:38.373 --> 04:57:40.809
PRICE TAG FOR. LIMITED

04:57:40.876 --> 04:57:43.512
DISTRIBUTION. SO I THE OTHER IS

04:57:43.579 --> 04:57:46.782
WE'RE THE WE'RE BASICALLY

04:57:46.848 --> 04:57:48.383
ALLOWING PEOPLE. DO YOU HAVE

04:57:48.450 --> 04:57:50.586
CHOICES. IF THEY SEEK TO DO

04:57:50.652 --> 04:57:54.957
THIS IN A MORE DIRECT WAY OR

04:57:55.023 --> 04:57:56.124
DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE GEOGRAPHIC

04:57:56.191 --> 04:57:58.760
WAY- AND HAVE A OF A MULTITUDE

04:57:58.827 --> 04:58:04.132
OF CHOICES. R. AS COMPARED

04:58:04.199 --> 04:58:04.666
280-001-0000 NINE THOUSAND

04:58:04.733 --> 04:58:07.236
DOLLARS. PLUNK DOWN AT A

04:58:07.302 --> 04:58:12.574
NEWSPAPER THAT THAT HAS THAT-

04:58:12.641 --> 04:58:15.877
CERTAINLY HAS OF CIRCULATION

04:58:15.944 --> 04:58:16.511
BUT THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT

04:58:16.578 --> 04:58:21.016
IT IS A- DIRECTED ARE TIED TO-

04:58:21.083 --> 04:58:23.585
WHERE THE- BIRDS WERE TAKEN

04:58:23.652 --> 04:58:26.355
WHERE THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:58:26.421 --> 04:58:28.924
FOLKS THANK THAT THE OWNERSHIP.

04:58:28.991 --> 04:58:30.492
MAY RESIDE THOSE KINDS OF

04:58:30.559 --> 04:58:32.394
THINGS SO IT'S TARGETED LESS

04:58:32.461 --> 04:58:34.496
EXPENSIVE AND ULTIMATELY GETS

04:58:34.563 --> 04:58:39.601
TO THE POINT. WHERE THE ABILITY

04:58:39.668 --> 04:58:42.104
TO DO WHAT NOTIFICATION SHOULD

04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:44.406
DO GET TO THE PEOPLE DO IT IN A

04:58:44.473 --> 04:58:47.242
WAY THAT ALLOWS EXPANSION OF

04:58:47.309 --> 04:58:48.577
DISTRIBUTION RATHER THAN

04:58:48.644 --> 04:58:50.212
CONTRACTION. AND BE ABLE TO GET

04:58:50.279 --> 04:58:52.914
THE- SATISFACTION THAT YOU'RE

04:58:52.981 --> 04:58:54.216
ACTUALLY GETTING THESE

04:58:54.283 --> 04:58:56.084
NOTIFICATIONS CANCEL THAT.

04:58:56.151 --> 04:58:57.352
INTEREST IN THE OWNERSHIP OF

04:58:57.419 --> 04:58:58.220
THOSE PLAN I UNDERSTAND

04:58:58.287 --> 04:58:59.354
DEFINITELY HAVING THE

04:58:59.421 --> 04:59:01.323
SATISFACTION OF EXPANDING THOSE

04:59:01.390 --> 04:59:03.191
OPTIONS OF NOTICING FOR

04:59:03.258 --> 04:59:04.693
ROOSTERS ARE **** OR OTHER

04:59:04.760 --> 04:59:06.828
ANIMALS THAT ARE APPREHENDED-

04:59:06.895 --> 04:59:08.030
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

04:59:08.096 --> 04:59:09.031
KNOW THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

04:59:09.097 --> 04:59:10.365
OF IT SO THAT'S WHY ASKING THE

04:59:10.432 --> 04:59:11.500
NUMBERS AND I DON'T MEAN IT AS

04:59:11.566 --> 04:59:12.868
AN OFFENSE I GENERALLY WANT TO

04:59:12.934 --> 04:59:14.736
KNOW HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS. SO

04:59:14.803 --> 04:59:15.771
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THOSE

04:59:15.837 --> 04:59:16.705
NUMBERS TO US THAT WOULD BE

04:59:16.772 --> 04:59:18.240
GREAT- BUT I THINK THE

04:59:18.307 --> 04:59:19.341
PRINCIPAL'S REPORT OF PUBLIC

04:59:19.408 --> 04:59:21.510
NOTICING SO A FORTY TODAY I

04:59:21.576 --> 04:59:22.144
WON'T BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF

04:59:22.210 --> 04:59:25.514
THE BILL- BUT DEFINITELY WOULD

04:59:25.580 --> 04:59:26.014
WANT TO KNOW HOW BIG THE

04:59:26.081 --> 04:59:27.683
PROBLEM IS. LET ME LET ME

04:59:27.749 --> 04:59:28.784
STIPULATE THAT IT IS A REAL BIG

04:59:28.850 --> 04:59:30.285
PROBLEM YOU'VE DEALT WITH AN

04:59:30.352 --> 04:59:32.454
AWFUL LOT OF BIG ISSUES TODAY.

04:59:32.521 --> 04:59:33.088
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS VERY

04:59:33.155 --> 04:59:34.923
MUCH CONSTRAINED- THE

04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:36.425
COCKFIGHTING PROTECTIVELY

04:59:36.491 --> 04:59:37.559
PARTICULARLY IN THE VALLEY AND

04:59:37.626 --> 04:59:39.161
IN SOME AREAS IN THE URBAN

04:59:39.227 --> 04:59:41.697
AREAS AS WELL. AND PROVIDE FOR

04:59:41.763 --> 04:59:45.600
A- CHOICE- WHICH COULD INCLUDE

04:59:45.667 --> 04:59:46.368
THE NEWSPAPERS ARE COULDN'T

04:59:46.435 --> 04:59:50.605
COULD INCLUDE- MINORITY- SITES

04:59:50.672 --> 04:59:53.208
ONLINE SITES OTHERS SO THERE IS

04:59:53.275 --> 04:59:57.913
A- SET OF CHOICES. MADE TO GET

04:59:57.979 --> 04:59:59.648
TO THE END GAME WHICH IS. BE

04:59:59.715 --> 05:00:01.316
SATISFIED THAT YOU'RE REACHING

05:00:01.383 --> 05:00:02.884
THE PEOPLE THAT MOST LIKELY

05:00:02.951 --> 05:00:04.753
WILL HAVE OWNERSHIP AND

05:00:04.820 --> 05:00:06.855
INFORMATION SO THAT THEY COULD

05:00:06.922 --> 05:00:09.658
HAVE SOME INPUT INTO THE

05:00:09.725 --> 05:00:10.258
DECISION OF THE DESTRUCTION OF

05:00:10.325 --> 05:00:14.596
THOSE BIRDS. THE CERK- LET ME

05:00:14.663 --> 05:00:15.163
SEE IF I CAN CONVINCE MISTER

05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:21.203
LEE. WELL SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM

05:00:21.269 --> 05:00:23.572
NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION IS

05:00:23.638 --> 05:00:25.607
PROBABLY ATTEMPT WHAT IT WAS

05:00:25.674 --> 05:00:28.877
WHEN WE- SET UP THESE LAWS.

05:00:28.944 --> 05:00:31.146
MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE INTERNET

05:00:31.213 --> 05:00:33.949
ACCESS TO TAKE THE NEWSPAPER.

05:00:34.015 --> 05:00:36.618
YOU PROBABLY WELL IN THE IN

05:00:36.685 --> 05:00:40.288
THE- IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS AN

05:00:40.355 --> 05:00:41.957
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THAT IS A

05:00:42.023 --> 05:00:43.692
FACTOR OF TEN IT COULD EVEN BE

05:00:43.759 --> 05:00:44.993
A HUNDRED BY THE TIME THIS

05:00:45.060 --> 05:00:47.129
DECADES OVER BECAUSE FRANKLY

05:00:47.195 --> 05:00:48.630
THE NEWSPAPERS KEEP ON

05:00:48.697 --> 05:00:50.499
CONSOLIDATING AND AS THEY

05:00:50.565 --> 05:00:53.268
CONSOLIDATE. THEY STOP COVERING

05:00:53.335 --> 05:00:55.537
LOCAL NEWS I WISH I KNEW WHAT

05:00:55.604 --> 05:00:57.205
WAS GOING ON IN EVERY CITY

05:00:57.272 --> 05:00:58.407
COUNCIL THERE WAS A TIME I

05:00:58.473 --> 05:01:00.542
COULD KNOW THAT. NOW I JUST

05:01:00.609 --> 05:01:02.577
HAVE TO CALL PEOPLE UP BECAUSE

05:01:02.644 --> 05:01:04.479
THE NEWSPAPER DOESN'T COVER IT

05:01:04.546 --> 05:01:06.648
YOU KNOW NO WONDER-

05:01:06.715 --> 05:01:08.950
CIRCULATIONS GOING DOWN WHEN

05:01:09.017 --> 05:01:10.652
THEY DON'T COVER THE THINGS

05:01:10.719 --> 05:01:12.654
THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS CARED ABOUT.

05:01:12.721 --> 05:01:14.222
ANYWAY GETTING BACK TO THAT A

05:01:14.289 --> 05:01:15.791
LOT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

05:01:15.857 --> 05:01:17.692
THE INTERNET AND FOR THAT

05:01:17.759 --> 05:01:19.528
REASON AND THE OTHER THING IS

05:01:19.594 --> 05:01:21.496
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOTICES I

05:01:21.563 --> 05:01:23.365
MEAN YOU'VE GOT COLUMN AFTER

05:01:23.432 --> 05:01:26.001
COLUMN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE SAVE

05:01:26.067 --> 05:01:29.571
NOTICES SHOULD BE IN THE PAPER.

05:01:29.638 --> 05:01:30.739
HOW YOU CAN NEVER FIND IT. SO

05:01:30.806 --> 05:01:32.941
THIS IS A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM. I

05:01:33.008 --> 05:01:34.142
WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU COULD

05:01:34.209 --> 05:01:36.711
THINK ABOUT. A WAY TO MAKE THIS

05:01:36.778 --> 05:01:38.914
UNIFORM SO ANOTHER WORDS

05:01:38.980 --> 05:01:41.183
SOMEBODY WHO LOST A PET. IN

05:01:41.249 --> 05:01:45.053
BAKERSFIELD COULD DO RESEARCH.

05:01:45.120 --> 05:01:47.222
AND IF THE PET ENDED UP IN

05:01:47.289 --> 05:01:49.491
FRESNO WHICH IS ENTIRELY

05:01:49.558 --> 05:01:52.127
LIKELY. THAT IT'S IN NOT IN THE

05:01:52.194 --> 05:01:54.062
CITY THEY ARE IN THEY COULD DO

05:01:54.129 --> 05:01:55.464
IT AN EASIER SEARCHING THIS

05:01:55.530 --> 05:01:57.432
WOULD BE A MATTER OF. PEOPLE

05:01:57.499 --> 05:01:59.901
COMING UP WITH COMMON WORDS TO

05:01:59.968 --> 05:02:03.271
BE USED- BUT THIS IS JUST SO

05:02:03.338 --> 05:02:05.740
FAR AHEAD OF WHAT YOU CAN DO

05:02:05.807 --> 05:02:09.411
WITH THE NEWSPAPER. AND I JUST

05:02:09.478 --> 05:02:11.713
I LOVE IT GREAT BILL. YOU WERE

05:02:11.780 --> 05:02:13.548
ALWAYS BRINGING US BILLS HERE

05:02:13.615 --> 05:02:14.950
AND PUBLIC SAFETY I REALLY

05:02:15.016 --> 05:02:17.185
APPRECIATE IT YOU'VE BROUGHT US

05:02:17.252 --> 05:02:18.220
TWO REALLY GOOD ONES TODAY

05:02:18.286 --> 05:02:20.055
THANK YOU TO THE APPRECIATE

05:02:20.121 --> 05:02:22.991
THAT. THANK YOU. WHICH WORKS

05:02:23.058 --> 05:02:26.661
THANKS OUR TOP THANK YOU- I

05:02:26.728 --> 05:02:27.262
DIDN'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND

05:02:27.329 --> 05:02:29.231
TO COMMITTEE LAST TIME. LAST

05:02:29.297 --> 05:02:30.632
YEAR- SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS

05:02:30.699 --> 05:02:32.400
YOU CAN'T UNANIMOUS- COMMITTEE

05:02:32.467 --> 05:02:34.970
LAST YEAR. THANK YOU MAY NOT

05:02:35.036 --> 05:02:36.371
HAVE BEEN IN ATTENDANCE I WAS

05:02:36.438 --> 05:02:38.573
HERE YEAH AND JUST LAID OFF

05:02:38.640 --> 05:02:41.843
YEP- OKAY BUT MY CONCERNS THAN

05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:44.446
WHICH ARE MY CONCERNS NOW- ARE

05:02:44.513 --> 05:02:46.047
SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ACLU AND

05:02:46.114 --> 05:02:47.282
THE NEWSPAPERS HAVE RAISED

05:02:47.349 --> 05:02:49.050
AROUND THE SETTING PRECEDENT

05:02:49.117 --> 05:02:51.453
FOR HOW PUBLIC NOTICES- GIVEN

05:02:51.520 --> 05:02:53.255
IN OTHER SITUATIONS EVEN I

05:02:53.321 --> 05:02:53.788
UNDERSTAND THIS IS A VERY

05:02:53.855 --> 05:02:55.824
NARROWLY FOCUSED. ISSUE THAT

05:02:55.891 --> 05:02:58.059
YOU'RE BEING FACED WITH CAN YOU

05:02:58.126 --> 05:03:00.495
JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE

05:03:00.562 --> 05:03:01.062
CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION

05:03:01.129 --> 05:03:02.998
HAVE RAISED. WELL I THINK THAT

05:03:03.064 --> 05:03:06.601
THAT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO

05:03:06.668 --> 05:03:09.104
THE OPPOSITION- THEY'RE

05:03:09.170 --> 05:03:11.406
ESSENTIALLY- ARGUING FOR A SET

05:03:11.473 --> 05:03:13.475
OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE

05:03:13.542 --> 05:03:16.878
OUTDATED AND ARE BEING LEFT

05:03:16.945 --> 05:03:17.612
BEHIND BY THE VERY TECHNOLOGY

05:03:17.679 --> 05:03:21.016
THAT IS- ESSENTIALLY FORCING

05:03:21.082 --> 05:03:23.184
NEWSPAPERS TO STEW. PUBLISH

05:03:23.251 --> 05:03:26.054
LESS HARD COPIES AND GO ONLINE

05:03:26.121 --> 05:03:28.790
SO I FIND IT A BIT DISINGENUOUS

05:03:28.857 --> 05:03:31.092
WHEN- THE NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION

05:03:31.159 --> 05:03:32.961
SUGGESTS THAT- WE'RE TREADING

05:03:33.028 --> 05:03:36.898
INTO- AREAS HERE WITH RESPECT

05:03:36.965 --> 05:03:38.967
TO LIMITED CONNECTIVITY NOT

05:03:39.034 --> 05:03:41.036
EVERYBODY HAS. ACCESS TO THE TO

05:03:41.102 --> 05:03:42.304
THE INTERNET. THE REALITY IS

05:03:42.370 --> 05:03:46.808
THAT. ABOUT IT IS MUCH MORE

05:03:46.875 --> 05:03:49.945
ADVANTAGEOUS TO UTILIZE A

05:03:50.011 --> 05:03:52.647
NEWSPAPERS ONLINE.

05:03:52.714 --> 05:03:54.716
ANNOUNCEMENTS THEN IT IS

05:03:54.783 --> 05:03:56.351
PUBLISHED ANNOUNCEMENTS BECAUSE

05:03:56.418 --> 05:03:57.686
OF WHAT I THINK HAS BEEN

05:03:57.752 --> 05:04:00.555
MENTIONED HERE SO THESE ARE

05:04:00.622 --> 05:04:04.092
KIND OF. OUTDATED STANDARDS. OF

05:04:04.159 --> 05:04:06.161
ASSESSING EFFECTIVE

05:04:06.227 --> 05:04:07.429
NOTIFICATIONS OVER REALLY

05:04:07.495 --> 05:04:08.697
INTERESTED IN AFFECTED

05:04:08.763 --> 05:04:11.366
NOTIFICATION WE ARE MODERNIZE

05:04:11.433 --> 05:04:13.335
IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE AND

05:04:13.401 --> 05:04:14.703
THAT'S WHAT THE BILL ATTEMPTS

05:04:14.769 --> 05:04:16.671
TO AN END HAVE YOU SAT DOWN

05:04:16.738 --> 05:04:18.373
WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN

05:04:18.440 --> 05:04:19.074
TERMS OF THE NEWSPAPER

05:04:19.140 --> 05:04:20.175
ASSOCIATION OTHERS WHO'VE

05:04:20.241 --> 05:04:22.177
SHARED THESE CONCERNS AND TRY

05:04:22.243 --> 05:04:23.545
TO WORK TOWARDS A COMPROMISE

05:04:23.612 --> 05:04:24.579
THAT WOULD WORK FOR THEM.

05:04:24.646 --> 05:04:26.147
THEY'VE NOT BEEN WILLING TO DO

05:04:26.214 --> 05:04:27.082
THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING

05:04:27.148 --> 05:04:28.817
TO DO THAT IS I HAVE A WITH

05:04:28.883 --> 05:04:29.851
WHICH WE'VE GOT WE'VE BEEN

05:04:29.918 --> 05:04:32.687
THROUGH THIS BEFORE B. AT LAST

EARLIER ABOUT HOW OFTEN THIS

05:08:52.013 --> 05:08:53.648
HAPPENS OR OR WHAT THE PROBLEM

05:08:53.715 --> 05:08:54.816
THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM IS

05:08:54.883 --> 05:08:58.186
JUST SIX MONTHS AGO THERE WAS.

05:08:58.253 --> 05:08:58.653
TWO TO THREE THOUSAND

05:08:58.720 --> 05:08:59.821
COCKFIGHTING ROOSTERS THAT WERE

05:08:59.888 --> 05:09:02.891
PICKED UP. AND IN. CITY CHATS

05:09:02.957 --> 05:09:05.493
WORKS- FEW YEARS BEFORE THAT

05:09:05.560 --> 05:09:07.128
THERE IS A I THINK IT'S THREE

05:09:07.195 --> 05:09:09.163
YEARS AGO WAS SEVEN THOUSAND- I

05:09:09.230 --> 05:09:11.399
WORKED IN AN AREA WHERE THIS.

05:09:11.466 --> 05:09:13.801
TYPE OF ACTIVITY WAS REPORTED

05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:16.304
ROUTINE. AND YES POLICE

05:09:16.371 --> 05:09:17.605
DEPARTMENT HAD TO GO OUT THERE

05:09:17.672 --> 05:09:18.940
AND BREAK GOES UP ANIMAL

05:09:19.007 --> 05:09:21.609
CONTROL WOULD COME OUT. AND IN

05:09:21.676 --> 05:09:23.645
AND DAY OUT TO SMALLER AGENCY

THAT- WAS THERE AND SO IT IT IS

05:09:27.148 --> 05:09:28.383
I THINK IT IS A PROBLEM I'LL BE

05:09:28.449 --> 05:09:30.551
VOTING FOR YOUR BILL TODAY-

05:09:30.618 --> 05:09:32.086
BECAUSE IT'S A ONE PROBLEM AND

05:09:32.153 --> 05:09:35.023
I THINK CAN BE- SALT FROM A

05:09:35.089 --> 05:09:36.758
COST PERSPECTIVE. BY BEING A

05:09:36.824 --> 05:09:38.493
LITTLE BIT MORE BROAD. AND

05:09:38.559 --> 05:09:40.161
USING THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH I

05:09:40.228 --> 05:09:43.164
JUST DID- TO FIND SOME OF THE

05:09:43.231 --> 05:09:44.065
ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION

05:09:44.132 --> 05:09:47.969
EARLIER- BUT DOES. THAT GET AS

05:09:48.036 --> 05:09:49.938
AVAILABLE TO US TO REDUCE SOME

05:09:50.004 --> 05:09:51.306
OF THESE COSTS FOR THE CITY'S

05:09:51.372 --> 05:09:56.311

05:10:20.134 --> 05:10:21.803

05:10:21.869 --> 05:10:30.244
OKAY WE- OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU

05:10:30.311 --> 05:10:32.413
SEE HERE. THE QUICK QUESTIONS

05:10:32.480 --> 05:10:33.848
THE WAY AND HOPEFULLY

05:10:33.915 --> 05:10:35.149
CONSIDERATIONS MADE FOR DOWN

05:10:35.216 --> 05:10:36.584
AYE LOOK I'M GENERAL SUPPORT OF

05:10:36.651 --> 05:10:37.852
SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU BETTER DOWN

05:10:37.919 --> 05:10:40.021
CONTINUE MOVE FORWARD. BUT

05:10:40.088 --> 05:10:40.588
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT

05:10:40.655 --> 05:10:42.757
WILL CONCLUDE ON THE LINE YOU

05:10:42.824 --> 05:10:44.359
KNOW L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G FOR A HYBRID SORT&lt;/c&gt;

05:10:44.425 --> 05:10:46.027
OF MODEL WHERE IT MAKES SENSE

05:10:46.094 --> 05:10:46.861
IN SOME COMMUNITIES MAY NOT

05:10:46.928 --> 05:10:50.598
HAVE ACCESS- TO- TO THE

05:10:50.665 --> 05:10:53.301
INTERNET IS AS COMPARED TO THE

05:10:53.368 --> 05:10:56.537
OTHER SIDE FOR ME. MASCHINEN

05:10:56.604 --> 05:11:02.276
THE WAITER. WELL AGAIN I MEAN I

05:11:02.343 --> 05:11:05.813
IF. I GUESS MY BUT MY SHORT

05:11:05.880 --> 05:11:08.750
ANSWER IS I DON'T THINK SO-

05:11:08.816 --> 05:11:11.219
THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO BE A

05:11:11.285 --> 05:11:14.122
BIG HIGH HURDLE- TO GET OVER

05:11:14.188 --> 05:11:16.557
WITH RESPECT TO THE END PROCESS

05:11:16.624 --> 05:11:19.427
HERE. WHICH IS UTILIZING IN A

05:11:19.494 --> 05:11:21.529
COST EFFECTIVE WAY. AT MANNER

05:11:21.596 --> 05:11:26.100
IN WHICH THIS DISSEMINATING-

05:11:26.167 --> 05:11:37.912
THAT THAT'S WIDE A POSSIBILITY.

05:11:37.979 --> 05:11:38.546
OF INFORMATION. I THERE NUMBER

05:11:38.613 --> 05:11:39.480
NUMBER TWO. THE THIS IS NOT.

05:11:39.547 --> 05:11:42.083
APPROACH THIS THIS IS THIS IS.

05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:43.051
THE CAN CHOOSE OF A ROW OF WAYS.

05:11:43.117 --> 05:11:46.554
BUT IF THEY DID A- A LIMITED

05:11:46.621 --> 05:11:48.790
PERHAPS A DEMOGRAPHIC AREA THEY

05:11:48.856 --> 05:11:50.324
PICKED UP THE BIRDS UP AND THEY

05:11:50.391 --> 05:11:52.226
WANT TO MANAGE. HOW THEY GO

05:11:52.293 --> 05:11:55.463
ABOUT MAKING THE NOTIFICATIONS.

05:11:55.530 --> 05:11:57.865
SECONDLY I THINK THERE ISN'T AN

05:11:57.932 --> 05:12:01.903
INTEREST IN. THE ORGANIZATIONS

05:12:01.969 --> 05:12:04.005
THAT ARE GOING TO- TO PUBLISH

05:12:04.072 --> 05:12:08.810
TO FIND WAYS THAT ARE. NEW- AT

05:12:08.876 --> 05:12:11.479
DIFFERENT BUT HAVE THE ABILITY

05:12:11.546 --> 05:12:18.586
TO- HAVE IT THE- NOTIFIED OR

05:12:18.653 --> 05:12:21.756
OR- SO THAT THEY CAN THAT THEY

05:12:21.823 --> 05:12:23.524
CAN HAVE A RECORD THAT IT WAS

05:12:23.591 --> 05:12:27.462
IN FACT. A PUBLISHED- THESE ARE

05:12:27.528 --> 05:12:28.062
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THESE

05:12:28.129 --> 05:12:30.998
OTHER. OPPORTUNITY SUGGEST

05:12:31.065 --> 05:12:33.501
WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS

05:12:33.568 --> 05:12:35.470
IS A THAT THIS IS A TWEET. BUT

05:12:35.536 --> 05:12:40.274
THIS IS A PERMISSIVE EFFORT TO

05:12:40.341 --> 05:12:43.144
GO AND FIND AFFORDABLE WAYS. TO

05:12:43.211 --> 05:12:45.780
DO THE SAME THING M. I JUST

05:12:45.847 --> 05:12:48.850
WOULD COME BACK TO THE- PRICE

05:12:48.916 --> 05:12:53.688
TAG OF 800-021-1000 DOLLARS-

05:12:53.754 --> 05:12:57.058
FOR ACTIVITY THAT. THERE COULD

05:12:57.125 --> 05:13:00.928
BE- DISTRIBUTED IN A IN IN A

05:13:00.995 --> 05:13:03.397
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS YEAH

05:13:03.464 --> 05:13:05.399
I GUESS THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER.

05:13:05.466 --> 05:13:07.068
WE'RE GONNA LOOK TO TOMORROW

05:13:07.135 --> 05:13:07.702
WE'RE GOING TO GOING TO LOOK TO

05:13:07.768 --> 05:13:10.404
YESTERDAY. PERMISSIBLE THE WORD

05:13:10.471 --> 05:13:14.175
I WAS LOOKING FOR HIS FOR. ANY

05:13:14.242 --> 05:13:14.876
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

05:13:14.942 --> 05:13:18.546
MEMBERS. WITH WITH THAT YOU MAY

05:13:18.613 --> 05:13:20.882
CLOSE MISSED BETTER. I'LL I'LL

05:13:20.948 --> 05:13:22.283
I'LL I'LL LET THAT BE MY CLOSE

05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:26.921
THIS THIS IS- AN OPPORTUNITY-

05:13:26.988 --> 05:13:29.023
THAT IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE

05:13:29.090 --> 05:13:30.358
THAT IT IS LIMITED IN SCOPE

05:13:30.424 --> 05:13:32.260

DOESN'T GRANT THE RELEASE

05:28:11.905 --> 05:28:12.873
THAT'S CORRECT SO THEY STILL

05:28:12.939 --> 05:28:14.508
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HEARING

05:28:22.082 --> 05:28:23.417
GETTING THEM IDEALLY TO A PRO

05:28:23.483 --> 05:28:25.585
BOWL EARLIER BUT IT ALSO MAY

05:28:25.652 --> 05:28:27.721
REDUCE. OVERALL THEIR SENSE OF.

05:28:27.788 --> 05:28:29.890
WHAT THE REAL ANSWER TO THAT IS

05:28:29.956 --> 05:28:32.959
THAT WHEN. PEOPLE ARE CURSORY

05:28:33.026 --> 05:28:34.861
DO TAKE THIS PROGRAMMING AND DO

FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THEIR

05:28:38.698 --> 05:28:39.699
RECIDIVISM RATES ARE

05:28:39.766 --> 05:28:41.735
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. SO BY

05:28:41.802 --> 05:28:43.070

ACTUALLY CREATING. A SAFER

05:28:49.042 --> 05:28:50.644

05:28:50.710 --> 05:28:53.447
LIKELY TO RE OFFEND- RECOMMIT

05:28:53.513 --> 05:28:54.281

IT MAKES FOR BETTER OUTCOMES

05:29:07.260 --> 05:29:08.795

05:31:33.373 --> 05:31:35.542
THEM TO STAY ON LONGER. THE

05:31:35.609 --> 05:31:37.711
PROBLEM IS THAT THAT IF WITHOUT

05:31:37.777 --> 05:31:38.912
THIS REVIEW KIDS ARE

05:31:38.979 --> 05:31:40.880

AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT

05:31:46.720 --> 05:31:48.421
THAT REPRESENTS SO WHAT WE'RE

05:31:48.488 --> 05:31:50.023
TRYING TO DO IS GET THEM OFF OF

05:31:50.090 --> 05:31:52.092

AND ENSURE THAT THESE YOUTHS

05:31:55.495 --> 05:31:57.964

05:31:58.031 --> 05:31:59.799
UP FOREVER IN THESE ENDESS

05:31:59.866 --> 05:32:02.502
CYCLES THAT PROBATION OFF THAT

THE PROBATION TERMS CAN OFTEN

05:32:03.536 --> 05:32:06.206

05:32:06.273 --> 05:32:08.308
ABOUT RACE IN CALIFORNIA MAKE

05:32:08.375 --> 05:32:09.943
NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. IF YOU

05:32:10.010 --> 05:32:12.712
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THAT A-

05:32:12.779 --> 05:32:14.781

SIGNIFICANTLY. MORE RESTRICTIVE

05:32:21.921 --> 05:32:24.024
THAT AWAIT YOU. AND THIS IS

05:32:24.090 --> 05:32:26.259
REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

05:32:26.326 --> 05:32:28.395

OUR CONCERN IS THE WAY THE BILL

IS DRAFTED IS THAT IT IS

05:55:54.866 --> 05:55:56.702
ACTUALLY NOT TO BE ALLEGED

05:55:56.768 --> 05:55:59.337
VICTIM OF A GANG RELATED A

05:55:59.404 --> 05:56:01.540
CHANCE THAT INITIATES THE

05:56:01.606 --> 05:56:03.108
REQUEST TO KEEP HIS OR HER

05:56:03.175 --> 05:56:05.844
NAME- OUT OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS

05:56:05.911 --> 05:56:08.080
ACT REQUEST. INSTEAD IT IS LAW

05:56:08.146 --> 05:56:09.781
ENFORCEMENT THAT MUST INITIATE

05:56:09.848 --> 05:56:12.050
THEN ASK SOMEONE. ABOUT WHETHER

05:56:12.117 --> 05:56:12.918
OR NOT THEY WANT THEIR NAME BE

05:56:12.984 --> 05:56:15.821
ACTED ON OR CONCERNS THAT THERE

05:56:15.887 --> 05:56:17.022
COULD BE SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY

05:56:17.089 --> 05:56:19.424
AN ALLEGED GANG RELATED CASES

05:56:19.491 --> 05:56:21.560
MORE THAN SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH

05:56:21.626 --> 05:56:23.729
INDIVIDUALS THE MESS IDENTIFIED

05:56:23.795 --> 05:56:25.630
AS BEING MEMBERS OF THE GANG AT

05:56:25.697 --> 05:56:27.766
POINT OF AROUND- THAT

05:56:27.833 --> 05:56:29.434
INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ASKED. LAW

05:56:29.501 --> 05:56:31.269
ENFORCEMENT WILL SAY HEY YOUR

05:56:31.336 --> 05:56:34.005
NAME CAN BE PUBLIC UNLESS YOU

05:56:34.072 --> 05:56:35.307
SAY THAT YOU FELT THREATENED.

05:56:35.373 --> 05:56:36.408
ARE YOU STILL AT YOU'RE NOT

05:56:36.475 --> 05:56:38.243
SAFE AND WE FEEL THAT

05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:39.778
INDIVIDUALS ARE THERE WILL BE A

05:56:39.845 --> 05:56:41.079
HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUALS A

05:56:41.146 --> 05:56:42.848
PERCENTAGE OF ANIMALS WHO ARE

05:56:42.914 --> 05:56:43.882
GOING TO RESPOND IN THE

05:56:43.949 --> 05:56:45.584
AFFIRMATIVE EVEN IF THEY ARE

05:56:45.650 --> 05:56:47.052
NOT CONCERNED SIMPLY BECAUSE

05:56:47.119 --> 05:56:49.488
THEY- WANT THEIR NAME. ARE THEY

05:56:49.554 --> 05:56:51.223
DON'T WANT ANY PUBLIC AUTHORITY

05:56:51.289 --> 05:56:53.492
OF REASONS- AND SO THE CONCERN

05:56:53.558 --> 05:56:54.726
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT

05:56:54.793 --> 05:56:56.762
INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A

05:56:56.828 --> 05:56:58.663
PROBLEM WITH INDIVIDUALS BEING

05:56:58.730 --> 05:57:00.365
MISIDENTIFIED AS GANG MEMBERS

05:57:00.432 --> 05:57:01.967
THE CONCERN WOULD BE THAT IN A

05:57:02.033 --> 05:57:03.535
CASE GOING FORWARD. THE

05:57:03.602 --> 05:57:04.970

USED AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL WHO

05:57:15.981 --> 05:57:17.516
WAS ARRESTED AD SO I THINK

05:57:17.582 --> 05:57:18.416
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

05:57:18.483 --> 05:57:20.318
ASSURANCES THAT IT WON'T BE-

05:57:20.385 --> 05:57:21.653
AND I THINK WE NEED TO. BE

05:57:21.720 --> 05:57:23.655
CLARIFIED THAT IF IT'S AT THE

05:57:23.722 --> 05:57:25.257
REQUEST OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS

05:57:25.323 --> 05:57:27.526
OPPOSED TO REQUIRING LAW

05:57:27.592 --> 05:57:29.227
ENFORCEMENT TO ASK SOMEONE

05:57:29.294 --> 05:57:30.695
WHETHER OR NOT THEY FEAR FOR

05:57:30.762 --> 05:57:31.763

WOULD JUST THINK IT CREATES A

05:57:38.336 --> 05:57:39.471
LOT OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE THIS IS

05:57:39.538 --> 05:57:41.273
KIND OF A VERY UNIQUE TYPE OF

05:57:41.339 --> 05:57:43.108
CRIME IT AS FAR AS THE

05:57:43.175 --> 05:57:45.510
MISAPPLICATION OF GANG IDENTITY

05:57:45.577 --> 05:57:47.946

05:57:59.424 --> 05:57:59.958

DIS CLOSURE OF INFORMATION THAT

IN THE INVESTIGATION. SO IT IS

05:58:47.105 --> 05:58:49.374
IT TRUE THAT EXISTING LAW WOULD

05:58:49.441 --> 05:58:50.909
