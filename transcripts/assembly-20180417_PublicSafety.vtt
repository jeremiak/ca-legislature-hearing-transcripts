00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:16.581 region:rollup2
HERE'S A THOUGHT THAT SUPPORTERS

00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:52.570 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF

00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:54.538 region:rollup2
THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:57.141 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THIS.

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:58.876 region:rollup2
SO OTHER STATES.

00:47:57.141 --> 00:48:01.545 region:rollup2
DO ALLOW SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:02.913 region:rollup2
BUT FRANKLY I DOUBT THAT THAT.

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:04.215 region:rollup2
YELLING AT SOMEONE IF YOU DON'T

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.716 region:rollup2
STOP YOU'RE GOING TO GO INTO

00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:07.752 region:rollup2
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WOULD HELP

STOP THE FIGHT.

00:48:07.752 --> 00:48:10.087 region:rollup2
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:11.956 region:rollup2
WAY KIDS WHO GET INTO A FIGHT.

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:16.427 region:rollup2
.

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:18.396 region:rollup2
THINK. SO THE QUESTION IS.

00:48:16.427 --> 00:48:19.797 region:rollup2
IF OTHER STATES DON'T NEED

00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:22.266 region:rollup2
PEPPER SPRAY.

00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:23.968 region:rollup2
STOP A FIGHT.

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:26.070 region:rollup2
WHAT DID THEY DO IT APPARENTLY

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:28.405 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY? A HANDFUL OF

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.673 region:rollup2
STATES THAT DO ALLOW IT.

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:30.808 region:rollup2
.

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:33.077 region:rollup2

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:37.548 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO ASK THE SUPPLY I DO I

00:48:36.147 --> 00:48:38.182 region:rollup2
DO HAVE A RESPONSE WAS PART OF

00:48:37.548 --> 00:48:39.850 region:rollup2
MY COMMENTS.

00:48:38.182 --> 00:48:41.752 region:rollup2
FIRST.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:43.621 region:rollup2
SEVERAL STATES THAT TO HAVE

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:45.189 region:rollup2
BANNED THE USE PEPPER SPRAY

00:48:43.621 --> 00:48:46.524 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE RUMORS

00:48:45.189 --> 00:48:47.992 region:rollup2
PICTURE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

00:48:46.524 --> 00:48:49.527 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE.

00:48:47.992 --> 00:48:51.362 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TOOL. OR DETERRENT

00:48:49.527 --> 00:48:53.197 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

00:48:51.362 --> 00:48:56.233 region:rollup2
THE OTHER FACTOR IS THAT MANY

00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:58.569 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED THE.

00:48:56.233 --> 00:49:00.404 region:rollup2
LOWER HOME STAFF RATIOS

00:48:58.569 --> 00:49:01.272 region:rollup2
SHE HAVE MORE STAFF AVAILABLE SO

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:02.706 region:rollup2
THERE'S OUTCOME THERE'S A

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:04.608 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF FACTORS.

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:05.776 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOW THE STAFF TO HAVE.

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.678 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT A GREATER ABILITY TO

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:09.246 region:rollup2
CONTROL SITUATION.

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:10.748 region:rollup2
EGGMAN EASILY OUT OF HAND SO IN

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:12.616 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NEW RATIOS ARE ONE TO

00:49:10.748 --> 00:49:14.552 region:rollup2
TEN. THE PODS ARE TYPICALLY

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:16.353 region:rollup2
TWENTY OR THIRTY JUVENILE SO

00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:17.488 region:rollup2
RIGHT YOU HAVE TO STAFF TO

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:18.823 region:rollup2
TWENTY KIDS PER THREE STEP

00:49:17.488 --> 00:49:20.057 region:rollup2
THIRTY KIDS.

00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:22.026 region:rollup2
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GET

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:23.828 region:rollup2
DETERRENT IN A REAL HURRY.

00:49:22.026 --> 00:49:24.395 region:rollup2
SPECIAL IF YOU DON'T HAVE

00:49:23.828 --> 00:49:25.896 region:rollup2
SOLITUDE YOU DON'T HAVE THE

00:49:24.395 --> 00:49:26.831 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO.

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:28.265 region:rollup2
BUT THE KIDS IN A ROOM STRUCTURE

00:49:26.831 --> 00:49:30.668 region:rollup2
SITUATION ORDERED TO SAY

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:32.236 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCE.

00:49:30.668 --> 00:49:33.304 region:rollup2
WE ARE ABOUT THE PEPPER SPRAY.

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:35.372 region:rollup2
THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET

00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:36.373 region:rollup2
THE CITRUS AND CONTROL.

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:37.842 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT OF WHAT TO THE

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:40.778 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS HAVE TO STAY WHAT IS

00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:42.513 region:rollup2
DONE IN OTHER STATES.

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:44.481 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY A MYSTERY

00:49:42.513 --> 00:49:46.217 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT TO DO IN IS AND. AYE I

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:47.518 region:rollup2
BELIEVE YEAH OF THE PROBATION

00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:49.286 region:rollup2
OFFICERS IN THE STATE ARE ALSO

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:51.322 region:rollup2
TRAINED TO DO SOME OF THESE

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:52.990 region:rollup2
THINGS ALREADY YEAH. IT'S

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:54.692 region:rollup2
CREATING A FACILITY CULTURE

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.427 region:rollup2
WHERE. INTERVENTIONS ARE DONE IN

00:49:54.692 --> 00:49:58.329 region:rollup2
ADVANCE.

00:49:56.427 --> 00:49:59.997 region:rollup2
IT IS

00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:01.432 region:rollup2
CREATING A CULTURE WHERE YOUNG

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:05.569 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FEEL SAFE ALREADY IN

00:50:01.432 --> 00:50:07.471 region:rollup2
THERE NOT AS INCLINED TO.

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.806 region:rollup2
START ON STATE SITUATIONS I

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.607 region:rollup2
THINK EDGAR CAN SPEAK A LITTLE

00:50:08.806 --> 00:50:11.375 region:rollup2
BIT TO THAT.

00:50:09.607 --> 00:50:12.510 region:rollup2
.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.077 region:rollup2
IT'S KNOWING THE TRIGGERS FOR

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.611 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE THEY ARE

00:50:13.077 --> 00:50:15.779 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:50:13.611 --> 00:50:17.114 region:rollup2
.

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:18.349 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:20.184 region:rollup2
NOT A MAGIC BULLET IT'S IT'S

00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:22.119 region:rollup2
HARD WORK AND BUT OTHER STATES

00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:23.120 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE IT I I DISAGREE WITH

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.955 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA'S YOU

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.823 region:rollup2
THERE SO MUCH WORSE.

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:27.224 region:rollup2
THEN THE YOUTH AND OTHER STATES

00:50:25.823 --> 00:50:29.727 region:rollup2
WE HAVE YOUTH AND OTHER STATES

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:31.495 region:rollup2
WHO ARE ALSO. DETAINED FOR VERY

00:50:29.727 --> 00:50:32.963 region:rollup2
SERIOUS OFFENSES FOR MURDER FOR

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:34.532 region:rollup2
ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:35.799 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHAT TO DO

00:50:34.532 --> 00:50:37.535 region:rollup2
THOSE FACILITIES ARE DOING IT

00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:39.570 region:rollup2
SAFELY THERE'S NOT REALLY A

00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:41.739 region:rollup2
REASON WHY CALIFORNIA CAN'T.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:43.307 region:rollup2
MOM ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:44.608 region:rollup2
REASON MR TARIQ I JUST GAVE

00:50:43.307 --> 00:50:48.979 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT THEY HAVE BETTER

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:50.981 region:rollup2
STAFFING RATIOS.

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:52.483 region:rollup2
SORRY I YEAH I WAS CONFUSED GUY

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:55.419 region:rollup2
HEADS DAMN BETTER STAFFING

00:50:52.483 --> 00:50:57.788 region:rollup2
RATIOS WHAT ABOUT THAT ARGUMENT.

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:58.255 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN I. DO THINK IT'S

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:02.159 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TO HEAR.

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:04.361 region:rollup2
TEAR THAT ARGUMENT I YOU KNOW.

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:06.397 region:rollup2
I.

00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:08.332 region:rollup2
DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT WE HAVE.

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.967 region:rollup2
ANY CONCRETE NUMBERS ON STAFFING

00:51:08.332 --> 00:51:11.535 region:rollup2
RATIOS FOR EVERY STATE THAT

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:12.970 region:rollup2
DOESN'T USE PEPPER SPRAY HAVE

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:14.705 region:rollup2
HEARD SORT OF THE ASSERTION THAT

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.906 region:rollup2
MANY PLACES DO HAVE BETTER

00:51:14.705 --> 00:51:17.908 region:rollup2
STAFFING RATIOS BUT I. HAVEN'T

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:18.842 region:rollup2
SEEN ANY.

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.244 region:rollup2
ANY INFORMATION TO REALLY BACK

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:22.913 region:rollup2
THAT UP BY I DON'T KNOW THAT TO

00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:24.515 region:rollup2
BE THE CASE ON EVEN SO IF YOU

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:25.816 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THAT POINTS TO. A

00:51:24.515 --> 00:51:27.117 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPTION OUR STAFFING

00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:28.919 region:rollup2
RATIOS ARE NOT MANDATORY.

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:30.487 region:rollup2
.

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:32.022 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IN THIS IN THE STATE ARE

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:33.257 region:rollup2
FREE TO HIGH HER MORE MORE

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:34.959 region:rollup2
PROBATION OFFICERS MORE

00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:36.160 region:rollup2
PROBATION COUNSELORS IF THEY

00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:38.362 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T RUN THEIR

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.663 region:rollup2
FACILITY SAFELY FOR YOUTH. WITH

00:51:38.362 --> 00:51:42.166 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT STAFFING RATIOS THEY

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:44.602 region:rollup2
HAVE. ON THE THAT'S A FLOOR NOT

00:51:42.166 --> 00:51:45.970 region:rollup2
A CEILING AND SAID SO IT'S MAY

00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:48.005 region:rollup2
REQUIRE REALLOCATION OF

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:49.873 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BUT. I BELIEVE THAT

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:50.774 region:rollup2
THAT THE SAFETY OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:52.543 region:rollup2
IN OUR FACILITIES IS WORTH THAT.

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:54.345 region:rollup2
.

00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:55.913 region:rollup2
WELL CLEARLY WHAT THE OTHER

00:51:54.345 --> 00:51:57.815 region:rollup2
WITNESSES SAID IT I MEAN YOU

00:51:55.913 --> 00:52:00.751 region:rollup2
WERE PIANIST THERE'S NO DOUBT IN

00:51:57.815 --> 00:52:02.319 region:rollup2
MY MIND. IF FEWER RESTRAINED.

00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:03.754 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WAS USING PEPPER SPRAY

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:07.691 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST PLAIN ABUSE.

00:52:03.754 --> 00:52:09.660 region:rollup2
.

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:10.594 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN TALKING WITH OUR

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.030 region:rollup2
ALAMEDA COUNTY PROBATION.

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:13.697 region:rollup2
.

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.833 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT.

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:16.900 region:rollup2
THEY FELT IT WAS ESSENTIAL AND

00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:17.635 region:rollup2
I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.637 region:rollup2
GOOD PEOPLE.

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:21.372 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:24.041 region:rollup2
THEY JUST FEEL IT'S ESSENTIAL.

00:52:21.372 --> 00:52:25.776 region:rollup2
ARM AND I KNOW HOW MUCH THEY

00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:27.711 region:rollup2
LOVE THE PEOPLE IN THEIR CARE.

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:30.581 region:rollup2
SO I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE THAT

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:31.949 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE.

00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:34.318 region:rollup2

TODAY TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON THE

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.423 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE STAFFING THESE

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:40.758 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AT MANY OF WHOM

00:52:39.423 --> 00:52:42.526 region:rollup2
GENUINELY CARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:52:40.758 --> 00:52:44.361 region:rollup2
IN GOING TO THIS LINE OF WORK.

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:45.629 region:rollup2
FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS.

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:47.698 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS THE CASE WHEN ONE

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:49.433 region:rollup2
HAS A TOOL ONE BECOMES

00:52:47.698 --> 00:52:50.634 region:rollup2
ACCUSTOMED TO USING THAT TOOL.

ON AND WHILE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:54.138 region:rollup2
TO ENVISION DOING THE JOB

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:55.939 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IT WE KNOW THAT THAT

00:52:54.138 --> 00:52:57.474 region:rollup2
STAFFER ADAPTABLE AND ARE ABLE

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:58.876 region:rollup2

VISITING BUT.

00:53:02.246 --> 00:53:04.948 region:rollup2
STAFF IN OKLAHOMA WERE ALSO

00:53:03.814 --> 00:53:06.884 region:rollup2

ON THAT SCHEDULE WAS ACCELERATED

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:14.892 region:rollup2

00:53:14.892 --> 00:53:17.995 region:rollup2

BELIEVE.

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:41.772 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THAT

00:55:40.938 --> 00:55:44.007 region:rollup2
SORT OF CULTURAL SOMEBODY.

00:55:41.772 --> 00:55:45.442 region:rollup2

TO BE IMPLEMENTED WHAT I WHAT MY

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:02.359 region:rollup2
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:04.061 region:rollup2
WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES I

00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:07.164 region:rollup2
NOTICED THAT SOUNDS.

00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:08.465 region:rollup2
A BIT WILD SAY BUT I STRUGGLED.

00:56:07.164 --> 00:56:09.366 region:rollup2
A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND I FIRST

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.933 region:rollup2
GOT HERE AND WE HAD THAT

CONVERSATION COMMITTED THERE WAS

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:21.612 region:rollup2
MERITED POLICY POINTS AS TO WHY.

00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:23.814 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL NEED TO BE ENACTED

00:56:21.612 --> 00:56:27.351 region:rollup2
AND I FIND MYSELF.

WRITTEN.

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:34.091 region:rollup2
IF ADMINISTRATOR HAS TO PROVE IT

00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:35.192 region:rollup2
IF IT'S IN A LOCKER.

LET ME EXPLAIN SUFFER SECOND

00:56:35.192 --> 00:56:38.762 region:rollup2
SCENARIO A.

00:56:35.993 --> 00:56:39.663 region:rollup2
A FIGHT OCCURS.

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:41.298 region:rollup2

EACH OTHER UP.

00:56:59.049 --> 00:57:03.153 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BRUTAL.

00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:05.389 region:rollup2
I TWO EXTREMELY BRUTAL SCENARIO

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:05.956 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:57:05.389 --> 00:57:06.490 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT'S WHY STRUGGLE

00:57:05.956 --> 00:57:08.492 region:rollup2
WITH IT BECAUSE.

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:10.193 region:rollup2
I.

HUMANE THING TO DO.

00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:14.464 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE WITHOUT ALL THE

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:17.567 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE THINGS THAT WE TALKED

AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THAT

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.008 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

00:57:23.507 --> 00:57:27.210 region:rollup2
.

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:29.146 region:rollup2
BEATEN DOWN ON KIDS ARE MISUSING

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:31.248 region:rollup2
IT OR THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF IT.

00:57:29.146 --> 00:57:32.215 region:rollup2
BUT IF I WANT TO TAKE.

00:57:31.248 --> 00:57:33.950 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE HIM MOST

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:36.219 region:rollup2
MOST MORE HUMANE APPROACH TO DO

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:37.354 region:rollup2
IT. IS WHEN THIS BREAKS OUT.

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:38.622 region:rollup2
I WANT THAT TO BE CLEAR AND TEN

00:57:37.354 --> 00:57:39.256 region:rollup2
SECONDS

FIFTEEN SECONDS EVEN OF A MEAN

00:57:39.256 --> 00:57:42.326 region:rollup2
SPRING.

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:44.695 region:rollup2
DO THAT REQUIRE BETTER TRAINING

00:57:42.326 --> 00:57:46.196 region:rollup2

NOT BE USED A AND WE'RE

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:48.365 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH THAT

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:50.300 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES A USE

00:57:48.365 --> 00:57:52.069 region:rollup2
OF FORCE IN THIS BUILDING.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:54.071 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A.

00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:55.939 region:rollup2
MAYBE YOU SAW FOR THE THE USE OF

00:57:54.071 --> 00:57:56.740 region:rollup2
SPRAY IS PROBABLY A BETTER PLACE

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:58.442 region:rollup2
TO BEGIN THAT SORT OF

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.509 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS I WON'T REITERATE

00:57:58.442 --> 00:58:00.744 region:rollup2
STAFFING WHICH I WILL REITERATE

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:02.312 region:rollup2
ALL THESE. ALL THESE OTHER

00:58:00.744 --> 00:58:02.913 region:rollup2
THINGS BUT THAT'S REALLY RIGHTS

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:03.714 region:rollup2
TROUBLE MISTER CHAIRS IN TERMS

00:58:02.913 --> 00:58:04.348 region:rollup2
OF.

00:58:03.714 --> 00:58:05.682 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE MORE HUMANE THING TO

00:58:04.348 --> 00:58:08.418 region:rollup2
DO.

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:09.619 region:rollup2
PLAYED OUT.

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.654 region:rollup2
AND I WONDER IF YOU MAY BE THE

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:12.255 region:rollup2
IF THE SPONSORS CAN SPEAK TO

00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:12.856 region:rollup2
THAT OR THE AUTHOR COULD DIRECT

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.024 region:rollup2
RESPONSES TO TO SPEAK TO THAT

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:18.028 region:rollup2
IF.

00:58:14.024 --> 00:58:19.629 region:rollup2
IF APPROPRIATE.

00:58:18.028 --> 00:58:21.431 region:rollup2
HA WHICH IS THE REASON WHY WE

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:23.200 region:rollup2
ARE DELAYING IMPLEMENTATION

00:58:38.949 --> 00:58:43.153 region:rollup2
IN ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT IS THE

00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:45.288 region:rollup2
GOOD SO. ARM WE BELIEVE THAT TO

OFFICE OR WAS IT SIMPLY SAYING

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:53.063 region:rollup2
THEY CANNOT CARRY THE SPRAY ON

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:54.297 region:rollup2
THEIR BODY ON THEIR PUT IN A

00:58:53.063 --> 00:58:56.033 region:rollup2
DEPOSITION.

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:57.567 region:rollup2
AND SO ARM.

00:58:56.033 --> 00:58:58.201 region:rollup2
SO SO WHERE WHERE IS THE LINE I

00:58:57.567 --> 00:58:58.969 region:rollup2
MEAN I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.871 region:rollup2
LINE SO.

00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:02.039 region:rollup2
WHERE ALLOWING TWO YEAR PERIOD

00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:03.807 region:rollup2
TO TRAIN THE OFFICERS

00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:06.510 region:rollup2
OF SO THAT WE CAN ALL KIND OF

00:59:03.807 --> 00:59:07.110 region:rollup2
FACE SEDAN AND IN THE MEANTIME

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.178 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT ALL THE SEATS WERE

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:10.247 region:rollup2
PUT TO BEEN DOING?

00:59:08.178 --> 00:59:10.881 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IS THE MOST HUMANE WAY

00:59:10.247 --> 00:59:13.250 region:rollup2
OF DOING IT SO SO THAT IS THE.

00:59:10.881 --> 00:59:15.218 region:rollup2
AND.

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:17.120 region:rollup2
MATT MATT I ASKED.

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:18.422 region:rollup2
SO MUCH OF THE QUESTION I HAVE

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.589 region:rollup2
REMAINING WOULD BE THE LET LET'S

00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:22.292 region:rollup2
SAY SEVERE DOES BREAK OUT.

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:24.728 region:rollup2
AND IT ESCALATES.

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:25.462 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD?

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:26.997 region:rollup2
HOW YOU THE VISION THAT

00:59:25.462 --> 00:59:30.834 region:rollup2
HAPPENING TEHAMA HOW MUCH TIME

00:59:26.997 --> 00:59:31.501 region:rollup2
HOW MANY KIDS GET HURT?

00:59:30.834 --> 00:59:31.701 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S A.

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:34.271 region:rollup2
VERY.

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:37.374 region:rollup2
.

00:59:34.271 --> 00:59:38.708 region:rollup2
SUBJECTIVE LA QUESTION I I THINK

00:59:37.374 --> 00:59:39.643 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE WANT

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:41.211 region:rollup2
DON'T LIMIT THE THE AMOUNT OF

00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:43.747 region:rollup2
TIME AND WE DON'T WANT TO

00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:45.182 region:rollup2
SPECIFY. IS YOU KNOW AS TO HOW

00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:47.451 region:rollup2
LONG WE SHOULD.

00:59:45.182 --> 00:59:48.652 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A JUDGMENT CALL ON

00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:49.786 region:rollup2
ON THE PART OF THE OFFICER I

00:59:48.652 --> 00:59:51.488 region:rollup2
THINK IF THE OFFICER DEEMS IT

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:53.490 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO RESORT TO USING

00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:55.258 region:rollup2
THIS RATE I THINK THAT'S WHEN.

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:56.393 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHEN HE OR SHE SHOULD

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:57.561 region:rollup2
DO THAT. ARM SO.

00:59:56.393 --> 00:59:58.662 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IT DEPENDS ON THE

00:59:57.561 --> 01:00:00.197 region:rollup2
SITUATION I MEAN THERE'S NO

00:59:58.662 --> 01:00:02.332 region:rollup2
FOUNTAIN YOU KNOW.

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:03.467 region:rollup2
RULE AND IN IN DETERMINING DOT I

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:05.769 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE SO IT ONE TIME AND

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:06.670 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL. I JUST LIKE TO SAY

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.205 region:rollup2
AT YOU KNOW.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:08.772 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:09.973 region:rollup2
MENTIONED RIGHT NOW WE DON'T

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.775 region:rollup2
HAVE

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:13.143 region:rollup2
HARD AND FAST RULES ABOUT ABOUT

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.377 region:rollup2
HOW SPACE SHOULD BE USED THEIR A

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:15.745 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:16.713 region:rollup2
PROTOCOLS AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:18.315 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED RESTRICTIONS AND?

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:20.717 region:rollup2
ENDS.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:21.852 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC I THINK

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:23.854 region:rollup2
THAT CONVERSATION DOES NEED TO

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:25.355 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BY THE WAY I DO YEAH

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:27.157 region:rollup2
LUNCH SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T WE ARE

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:28.325 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO CONTINUING

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:29.759 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.627 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:32.496 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:34.197 region:rollup2
WE?

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:35.599 region:rollup2
SHOULD RECOGNIZE IS THAT THERE'S

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.733 region:rollup2
A WIDE VARIATION ACROSS THE

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:37.834 region:rollup2
STATE BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.302 region:rollup2
FACILITIES LOOK LIKE AND WHAT

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.337 region:rollup2
THEIR POLICIES ARE.

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.872 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SORT

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:43.907 region:rollup2
OF.

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:46.009 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT SAY.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:47.944 region:rollup2
WITH OUR BILL WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:48.845 region:rollup2
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME THAT

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.647 region:rollup2
IT A YOUTH MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:52.182 region:rollup2
FIGHT. IS.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.517 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO POINT OUT I THINK I

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:54.918 region:rollup2
THINK WE KEEP HEARING FACILITY

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:56.653 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATOR ITS FACILITY

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:58.522 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATOR OR DESIGNEES.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:01:00.257 region:rollup2
SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO PUT

01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:01.358 region:rollup2
PROTOCOLS INTO PLACE THAT. WOULD

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:03.093 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT DOESN'T NEED VERY

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.327 region:rollup2
EASILY ACCESSIBLE THAT WOULD

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:06.062 region:rollup2
HAVE THE PEPPERS RESTORED IN AN

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:07.063 region:rollup2
EASILY ACCESSIBLE LOCATION THAT

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:08.231 region:rollup2
IS NOT PHYSICALLY ON THE

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:09.633 region:rollup2
OFFICERS I THINK WHEN WE'RE

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:11.801 region:rollup2
ENVISIONING A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE

01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:13.103 region:rollup2
HAVING TO CALL. THE CHIEF YOU

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:15.005 region:rollup2
KNOW THE HEAD OF THE FACILITY

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:16.373 region:rollup2
AND RUN TO A DIFFERENT ROOM GRAB

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.475 region:rollup2
THIS BREAK COME BACK.

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:19.910 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T THAT'S NOT REQUIRED

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.611 region:rollup2
BY THIS BILL AYE AYE FULLY

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.980 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT IN THE ABILITY OF

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.614 region:rollup2
FOLKS TO COME UP WITH PROTOCOLS

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.783 region:rollup2
THAT FIT WITHIN THIS BILL THAT

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:29.052 region:rollup2
WILL. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:30.787 region:rollup2
EXCUSE ME.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.421 region:rollup2
BEFORE BEFORE IT CAN BE USED

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:35.959 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY MISTER JIM ASKING

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:37.294 region:rollup2
A QUESTION.

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:40.263 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:40.864 region:rollup2
THEN I.

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:43.800 region:rollup2
I WILL MAKE IT MY LAST THAT'S

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:45.535 region:rollup2
OKAY WITH MISTER.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.437 region:rollup2
AND SO HERE'S THE OTHER POINT

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:49.639 region:rollup2
THAT STRUGGLE WITH RIGHT.

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:52.275 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SCENARIO BREAKS OUT.

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:54.411 region:rollup2
.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.611 region:rollup2
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THAT

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:56.313 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:58.181 region:rollup2
OFFICER SPRAY

01:01:56.313 --> 01:02:00.684 region:rollup2
SPRING HERE THAN TO ENGAGE.

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:02.619 region:rollup2
IF YOU ENGAGE.

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:04.254 region:rollup2
IT DID THAT LEADS TO AIM A MUCH

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:05.689 region:rollup2
WORSE PASS

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.489 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS AT THE

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:07.991 region:rollup2
MENTION PEOPLE GET HURT NOT TO

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:11.628 region:rollup2
MENTION.

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:13.430 region:rollup2
BUT IT ESCALATES THE SITUATION.

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:15.031 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ME LIES IN THAT BETTER

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.766 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A CARE IN THE STICK.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:18.568 region:rollup2
THEN TO HAVE BUT NOT THAT HAVE

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:19.970 region:rollup2
AN OFFICER ENGAGE.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:21.538 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERNED.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.706 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT IT POINTS TO

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:24.641 region:rollup2
SORT OF A FALSE DICHOTOMY I I

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:26.676 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK.

01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:27.677 region:rollup2
IN SITUATIONS THAT I'VE REVIEWED

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:29.879 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE HEARD.

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:31.781 region:rollup2
FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.716 region:rollup2
IT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF ARE WE

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.650 region:rollup2
GOING TO SPRING IN THE AIR OR

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:35.285 region:rollup2
ARE WE GOING TO PHYSICALLY

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:36.753 region:rollup2
INTERVENE PHYSICAL INTERVENTION

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:40.223 region:rollup2
OCCURS WHEN SPRAYS USE.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:42.292 region:rollup2
IN IN MANY IF IN MANY CASES.%

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:43.426 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH SPRAY

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:45.462 region:rollup2
IS STOPPING PHYSICAL

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.863 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS FROM HAPPENING ON

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:48.598 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S USED IN TANDEM.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.499 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THE IDEA THAT

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:51.635 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST A SIMPLE SPRING THE

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:52.535 region:rollup2
ARIES IS IS NOT EXACTLY HOW IT

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:54.170 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORKS IN FACILITIES I

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:55.839 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:57.307 region:rollup2
OKAY. ANYMORE QUESTIONS FROM

01:02:55.839 --> 01:03:00.276 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN.

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:07.150 region:rollup2

SO ARM SO I THOUGHT I THINK

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:57.767 region:rollup2

LET ME JUST REITERATE THE FACT

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:02.339 region:rollup2
THAT ALL THE THE.

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:03.707 region:rollup2

THEM TO TO FOSTER THAT

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:22.258 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP SO I THINK ON

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.759 region:rollup2

REQUIREMENT BY REQUIRING

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:57.926 region:rollup2
LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO ACCEPT.

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:59.294 region:rollup2
AN APPLICANT'S QUOTE STATED

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:01.997 region:rollup2
COULD CAUSE WITH ADDITIONAL

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:03.432 region:rollup2
INQUIRY. IF HE OR SHE STATES

01:25:01.997 --> 01:25:04.366 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DESIRE CCW LICENSE FOR

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.667 region:rollup2
SELF DEFENSE OR CRIME PREVENTION

01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:06.735 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.803 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD AFFIRMATIVELY

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.504 region:rollup2
PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:10.272 region:rollup2
REQUIRING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.540 region:rollup2
FROM SUCH APPLICANTS REGARDING

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:13.208 region:rollup2
ANY SPECIFIC A UNIQUE

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.810 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES PERTAINING TO THE

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.344 region:rollup2
COURT STATED COULD CAUSE.

01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:16.411 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD

01:25:15.344 --> 01:25:17.613 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN LAW

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.313 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO PROTECT

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.514 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITIES.

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:23.952 region:rollup2
WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE.

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:25.654 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:27.189 region:rollup2
A GOOD MORNING AMANDA WILCOX

01:25:25.654 --> 01:25:28.757 region:rollup2
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:30.859 region:rollup2
CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN

01:25:28.757 --> 01:25:31.526 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. I WILL

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:34.229 region:rollup2
BE BRIEF.

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:37.432 region:rollup2
THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN BEFORE

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:39.801 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE. MANY MANY TIMES

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:41.903 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS FAILED EACH TIME AND.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:44.706 region:rollup2
I SHOULD DO SO AGAIN THE KEY

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:46.541 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT THIS LEGISLATION

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:49.277 region:rollup2
PRESENTS AS SHE CALIFORNIA. MOVE

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:51.680 region:rollup2
FROM BEING AND MAY ISSUE. OUR

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:54.016 region:rollup2
CCW STATE TO A SHALL ISSUE IN

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.650 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SHALL ISSUE SCHEME LAW

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:57.119 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ESSENTIALLY WOULD

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.920 region:rollup2
LOSE THEIR DISCRETION ON

01:25:57.119 --> 01:26:01.723 region:rollup2
DETERMINING WHO CAN CARRY A

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.891 region:rollup2
LOADED HIDDEN. GUN IN PUBLIC UP

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:04.626 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT LAW

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:06.028 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:07.763 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN.

01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:09.798 region:rollup2
S. QUESTION AREN'T REMOVING THE

01:26:07.763 --> 01:26:11.967 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A SPECIFIC

01:26:09.798 --> 01:26:14.302 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED THREAT. INSTEAD TO

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:16.338 region:rollup2
JUST ARE ALLOWED TO BE GENERAL.

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:18.106 region:rollup2
SELF DEFENSE

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:20.609 region:rollup2
WHICH SOMETIMES MEANS I'M ON TO

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:22.511 region:rollup2
CARRY GUNS IN PUBLIC THAT IS NOT

01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:24.312 region:rollup2
AND GOOD ENOUGH REASON. UP

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:26.415 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THE RISKS INVOLVED

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:29.184 region:rollup2
WITH HAVING MORE LOADED HITTING

01:26:26.415 --> 01:26:31.086 region:rollup2
GUNS HONORS IN OUR STREETS AND

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:32.754 region:rollup2
IN OUR CITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:34.556 region:rollup2
NO CREDIBLE STATISTICAL

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:36.725 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SHOW THAT

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:38.927 region:rollup2
PERMISSIVE CARRY LAWS REDUCE

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:41.329 region:rollup2
CRIME IN FACT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:43.231 region:rollup2
THAT PERMISSIVE CCW LAWS MAY

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:44.1000 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY INCREASE THE FREQUENCY

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:47.169 region:rollup2
OF SOME TYPES OF CRIME. AND I

01:26:44.1000 --> 01:26:49.471 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST THAT BAD IF MORE GUNS

01:26:47.169 --> 01:26:50.806 region:rollup2
REALLY RESULTED IN LESS CRIME

01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:51.873 region:rollup2
THAN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:54.109 region:rollup2
THE SAFEST COUNTRY IN THE

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:55.577 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED WORLD. IT IS NOT.

01:26:54.109 --> 01:26:57.412 region:rollup2
I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:58.580 region:rollup2
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:26:57.412 --> 01:27:00.882 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:06.655 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:08.156 region:rollup2
ANY.

01:27:06.655 --> 01:27:09.057 region:rollup2
HELLO I'M SABRINA CHRIS SAID HE

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:13.562 region:rollup2
STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

01:27:11.827 --> 01:27:15.297 region:rollup2
PARTY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:17.032 region:rollup2
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:27:15.297 --> 01:27:20.335 region:rollup2
SENIOR NON.

01:27:17.032 --> 01:27:21.369 region:rollup2
YOU MAY CLOSE.

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:22.404 region:rollup2
WHAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.739 region:rollup2
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:24.973 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TODAY AND I WANT TO

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:26.475 region:rollup2
THANK ALL OF THE WITNESSES YOU

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:28.543 region:rollup2
CAME TO TESTIFY TODAY?

01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:29.711 region:rollup2
VERY OFTEN WE ARE ON OPPOSITE

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.046 region:rollup2
SIDES OF THIS ISSUE BUT I

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:31.947 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY RESPECT YOUR POINT OF

01:27:31.046 --> 01:27:33.715 region:rollup2
VIEW.

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:35.450 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY THOUGH I WANT TO

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:36.818 region:rollup2
POINT OUT A FEW FLIES IN THE

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:39.121 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY OF THE OPPOSITION AND

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:41.423 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT IT WOULD WEAKEN LAW

01:27:39.121 --> 01:27:42.057 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO SCREEN.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:44.726 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:46.528 region:rollup2
IN AND DECIDE WHO IS.

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:48.897 region:rollup2
WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THESE

01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:50.132 region:rollup2
PERMITS AM THAT IS FALSE?

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:51.399 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY STILL HAD TO GO

01:27:50.132 --> 01:27:52.634 region:rollup2
THROUGH A BACKGROUND CHECK THEY

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:54.402 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:56.638 region:rollup2
THE OTHER STANDARDS THAT ARE

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:59.741 region:rollup2
REQUIRED RIGHT NOW FOR C. CW'S.

01:27:56.638 --> 01:28:01.743 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS JUST FLATLY FALSE.

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:03.879 region:rollup2
I THIS IS I WILL REMIND EVERYONE

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:04.346 region:rollup2
AGAIN A RIGHT.

01:28:03.879 --> 01:28:05.614 region:rollup2
TO OWN A WEAPON NINETY

01:28:04.346 --> 01:28:08.049 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:09.584 region:rollup2
.

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:12.220 region:rollup2
I NOTICED ALSO THAT THERE WAS

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:13.622 region:rollup2
TWICE.

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.490 region:rollup2
THE PHRASE. LOADED HIDDEN GUN

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:17.726 region:rollup2
IN PUBLIC.

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:19.694 region:rollup2
WHICH SOUNDS VERY SINISTER

01:28:17.726 --> 01:28:22.364 region:rollup2
TIMMY AM PERHAPS THAT'S BY

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:24.099 region:rollup2
DESIGN BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:26.301 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMERICANS

01:28:24.099 --> 01:28:28.170 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE CARRIED A LOADED HIDDEN

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:30.672 region:rollup2
GUIDE IN PUBLIC AND ACTUALLY

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:33.842 region:rollup2
SAVED LIVES AND I'D. I WOULD

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:36.611 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE YOU TO GIVE ME. I

01:28:33.842 --> 01:28:39.548 region:rollup2
DON'T A HANDFUL ANVIL OF CASES

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:41.183 region:rollup2
IN WHICH A CCW HOLDER.

01:28:39.548 --> 01:28:43.018 region:rollup2
COMMITTED HARM AGAINST ANOTHER

01:28:41.183 --> 01:28:44.986 region:rollup2
FELLOW HUMAN BEING WITH THAT

01:28:43.018 --> 01:28:47.022 region:rollup2
LOADED HIDDEN GUN. THAT'S NOT

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:48.557 region:rollup2
THE CASE AND WE KNOW THAT CCW

01:28:47.022 --> 01:28:50.458 region:rollup2
HOLDERS ARE ARE AMONG THE MOST

01:28:48.557 --> 01:28:51.860 region:rollup2
LAW ABIDING WHEN IT COMES TO GUN

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:54.029 region:rollup2
OWNERSHIP. WE KNOW THAT THOSE

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.197 region:rollup2
ARE FACTS.

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:55.997 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE

01:28:55.197 --> 01:28:57.265 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THE

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:58.667 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WE ARE MORE MOST

01:28:57.265 --> 01:29:01.570 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT ARE THE PEOPLE

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:03.772 region:rollup2
WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE GUNS.

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:04.706 region:rollup2
MY REQUEST IS VERY SIMPLE IF

01:29:03.772 --> 01:29:06.675 region:rollup2
THEY CAN PASS THE BACKGROUND

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:08.610 region:rollup2
CHECK IF THEY ARE OF GOOD MORAL

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:09.110 region:rollup2
CHARACTER AND BECAUSE AND

01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:10.478 region:rollup2
STANDING BY THEIR LOCAL

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:12.581 region:rollup2
SHERIFF'S.

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:14.249 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE ISSUED A CCW

01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:16.051 region:rollup2
PERMIT ITS ACTIVE UP THERE

01:29:14.249 --> 01:29:18.420 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IN THE RECORD.

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:20.388 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD KEEP THEM FROM BEING

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:21.790 region:rollup2
ABLE TO POSSESS THAT WEAPON WITH

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:23.658 region:rollup2
THE CCW.

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:25.794 region:rollup2
THEN SO BE IT BUT I THINK THIS

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:27.429 region:rollup2
IS RIDICULOUS TO ALLOW FIFTY

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:29.397 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COUNTIES TO ASSIGN

01:29:27.429 --> 01:29:31.399 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STANDARDS.

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:33.034 region:rollup2
AND IT NO CONTINUITY ACROSS THE

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:35.637 region:rollup2
BOARD FOR WHO CAN HOLD A CCW

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:36.805 region:rollup2
PERMIT AND WHO CANNOT.

01:29:35.637 --> 01:29:38.773 region:rollup2
I JUST THINK THAT'S WRONG THIS

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:41.443 region:rollup2
IS AGAIN THIS IS A RIGHT IT IS

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:42.043 region:rollup2
NOT A PRIVILEGE.

01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:43.578 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:45.480 region:rollup2
VOTE.

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:47.048 region:rollup2
AND DANK UNITE AND NO YOU.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.149 region:rollup2
YOUR PASSION ABOUT DESIGN YOU

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:49.451 region:rollup2
BROUGHT JUST BEFORE AND ALL OF

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:53.255 region:rollup2
TOLD YOU.

01:29:49.451 --> 01:29:53.788 region:rollup2
THAT ARE EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE

01:29:53.255 --> 01:29:56.157 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:59.861 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. UMPIRES ARE

01:29:56.157 --> 01:30:02.197 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CC W. PERMIT HOLDERS.

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:03.531 region:rollup2
I'LL DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER GROUP

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:06.034 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:07.969 region:rollup2
.

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:08.870 region:rollup2
POLICY. WOULD IS NO PROPS WE

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:11.306 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS IN

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:14.142 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CCW HOLDERS AND I

01:30:11.306 --> 01:30:16.645 region:rollup2
THINK BECAUSE ASSIST EXISTING.

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:17.479 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND WINDED

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:19.180 region:rollup2
WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT HANDLE SINK

01:30:17.479 --> 01:30:20.415 region:rollup2
YES.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.317 region:rollup2
I EVEN MIGHT EVEN MY COUNTY

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:24.352 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD.

01:30:22.317 --> 01:30:26.187 region:rollup2
SOME CCW HOLDERS BECAUSE OF

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:28.356 region:rollup2
POLITICAL REASONS THAT WERE

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:30.292 region:rollup2
ISSUED DUMP.

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:30.926 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL CARRY WEAPONS PERMITS

01:30:30.292 --> 01:30:33.895 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN THEN.

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:34.362 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HAD ANY INCIDENTS

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.697 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW OF HERE IN

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:38.166 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:40.101 region:rollup2
AND SO UP MY NOSE MORE OF LET'S

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:41.903 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:43.071 region:rollup2
NEXT I CHANGE SOMETHING A

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:44.973 region:rollup2
FORMULA THAT IS WORKING

01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:46.641 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY WELL THERE'S PROBABLY

01:30:44.973 --> 01:30:49.144 region:rollup2
GOOD REASONS WHY IT SACRAMENTO

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:51.112 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE CCW HOLDERS ARE

01:30:49.144 --> 01:30:52.814 region:rollup2
PERMITS LET OUT. THEN CAP AND IN

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:54.716 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES THEY MAY BE VERY

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:56.651 region:rollup2
GOOD REASONS THAT LAW

01:30:54.716 --> 01:30:57.552 region:rollup2

WE THINK IT'S WELL INTENDED WE

AND TEN.

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:03.317 region:rollup2

THEIR IT'S INTENDED TO TO TARGET

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:08.722 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY GROW HOUSES. THE

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:10.357 region:rollup2
WAY IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED WOULD

01:52:08.722 --> 01:52:12.693 region:rollup2
BE A VIOLATION OF ANY ORDINANCE

01:52:10.357 --> 01:52:14.795 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY OF. A VELCRO.

01:52:12.693 --> 01:52:16.563 region:rollup2
ANECDOTALLY WE HAD A GROUSE

01:52:14.795 --> 01:52:17.931 region:rollup2
ACROSS MY IN MY HOUSE WHERE I

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:19.866 region:rollup2
LIVE IT DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:21.602 region:rollup2
THERE. AND WHEN THEY FINALLY

01:52:19.866 --> 01:52:23.704 region:rollup2

GROW HOUSE IN HIS IN HIS ARM? IN

HIS HOME AND I THINK THAT'S

01:52:35.315 --> 01:52:38.051 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IN MANY CASES THEY'RE

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:40.654 region:rollup2

A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. I'M I WANT

02:02:28.708 --> 02:02:31.444 region:rollup2
TO START BY SAYING THAT THE

02:02:29.776 --> 02:02:33.046 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF THIS BILL IS

02:02:31.444 --> 02:02:35.682 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A VERY NARROW

02:02:33.046 --> 02:02:37.617 region:rollup2
APPLICATION IT ONLY APPLIES TO

02:02:35.682 --> 02:02:39.385 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL

HAS PLAYED TO AND BEEN CONVICTED

02:02:39.385 --> 02:02:43.590 region:rollup2
OF AND SENTENCED TO A FELONY.

02:02:42.288 --> 02:02:45.525 region:rollup2
THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

02:02:43.590 --> 02:02:47.760 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION COMPLETING THE

02:02:45.525 --> 02:02:49.429 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES OF THEIR SENTENCE

ONCE THEY'VE COMPLETED THAT THEY

02:02:49.429 --> 02:02:52.665 region:rollup2
WILL GO BACK TO THE COURT AND

02:02:50.964 --> 02:02:54.434 region:rollup2
ASK FOR A REDUCTION TO A

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:55.935 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR SO THAT THEIR RECORD

02:02:54.434 --> 02:02:57.704 region:rollup2
NO LONGER REFLECTS A FELONY.

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:58.805 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD THING WE WANT TO

02:02:57.704 --> 02:03:00.707 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THAT AND WE WANT

02:02:58.805 --> 02:03:02.308 region:rollup2
COURTS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:03:00.707 --> 02:03:04.711 region:rollup2

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:10.516 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN THE ONE AREA WHERE

02:03:08.948 --> 02:03:11.918 region:rollup2
THE FELONY WON'T BE REDUCED TO A

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:13.019 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR IT WILL BE REDUCED

02:03:11.918 --> 02:03:15.288 region:rollup2
TO MISDEMEANOR AND ALL OTHER

02:03:13.019 --> 02:03:17.223 region:rollup2

NEW D. Y. OFFENSE

02:03:19.025 --> 02:03:22.262 region:rollup2
THEN THE PRIOR FELONY EVEN

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:23.763 region:rollup2
THOUGH IT'S BEEN REDUCED TO A

02:03:22.262 --> 02:03:25.198 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR WILL STILL BE

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:27.133 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A FELONY FOR THE

02:03:25.198 --> 02:03:28.668 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF CHARGING THE NEW DO

WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS.

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:37.543 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY FOR DECADES FELT IS

02:03:35.775 --> 02:03:39.612 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WHICH IS.

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:41.414 region:rollup2
OF LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM AND THE

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:43.383 region:rollup2
HIGH RATE OF RECIDIVISM INDIE Y.

02:03:41.414 --> 02:03:44.951 region:rollup2
FATALITIES AND ADDRESSING THOSE

02:03:43.383 --> 02:03:46.686 region:rollup2
AND CURBING THOSE AS WE MOVE

02:03:44.951 --> 02:03:48.087 region:rollup2
FORWARD WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS

02:03:46.686 --> 02:03:49.856 region:rollup2
SAID IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:51.291 region:rollup2
TREAT REPEAT OFFENDERS.

02:03:49.856 --> 02:03:53.092 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY AND ENHANCED

INDIE Y. CASES

02:03:54.594 --> 02:03:58.131 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW US TO

02:03:56.596 --> 02:04:00.833 region:rollup2
CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT AGAIN

02:03:58.131 --> 02:04:02.735 region:rollup2
WOULD ONLY APPLY TO A NEGLIGIBLE

02:04:00.833 --> 02:04:04.604 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUALS. IF THE

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:06.506 region:rollup2
CASE IS TRIED AS A FELONY TO

02:04:04.604 --> 02:04:08.274 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH AND CHARGES OF FELONY

02:04:06.506 --> 02:04:10.476 region:rollup2
DUI TO BEGIN WITH IT'S USUALLY

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:11.911 region:rollup2
SUCH AN ELEVATED CRIME THAT IT'S

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:13.546 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY TO BE REDUCED TO A

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:15.181 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR ANYWAY. BUT IN THE

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:16.616 region:rollup2
RARE SITUATION WHERE THE COURT

02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:18.384 region:rollup2
WILL USEITS DISCRETION AND

02:04:16.616 --> 02:04:20.353 region:rollup2
REWARD REHABILITATION AND

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:23.856 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:04:20.353 --> 02:04:23.856 region:rollup2
THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES

02:04:23.923 --> 02:04:27.760 region:rollup2
IN THEIR LIFE THAT THEY CAN GO

02:04:25.892 --> 02:04:29.395 region:rollup2
ON AND HAVE AND A RAP SHEET

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:30.430 region:rollup2
THAT'S FREE OF THE FELONY THAT

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:31.764 region:rollup2
THEY CAN HAVE A PLAYMATE

02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:33.232 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY CAN

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:35.201 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REBUILD THEIR LIVES.

02:04:33.232 --> 02:04:37.337 region:rollup2
THIS ONLY KICKS AND IF THEY PICK

02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:39.238 region:rollup2
UP A NEW DIY IF THEY PICK UP A

02:04:37.337 --> 02:04:41.040 region:rollup2
NEW DEAL AYE THEN THE DA WILL BE

02:04:39.238 --> 02:04:42.575 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CHARGE THE NEAT NEW DIY

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.844 region:rollup2
AS A FELONY. BECAUSE THE

02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:46.512 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL IS A REPEAT OFFENDER

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:49.415 region:rollup2
WHO WAS ONCE CONVICTED OF A

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:50.683 region:rollup2
FELONY DE WHY IT'S A VERY NARROW

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:52.952 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLE IT WILL HAVE A

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:54.587 region:rollup2
NEGLIGIBLE FISCAL AND PRACTICAL

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:56.022 region:rollup2
IMPACT BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A

02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:57.357 region:rollup2
LOW NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

02:04:56.022 --> 02:04:59.158 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHO

02:04:57.357 --> 02:05:00.893 region:rollup2

THEIR REAP TO THEIR CRIME

02:05:01.961 --> 02:05:04.397 region:rollup2
REDUCED FROM MISDEMEANOR ARE

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:06.399 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LEARNED AN

02:05:04.397 --> 02:05:08.901 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT LIFE LESSON WHO ARE

02:05:06.399 --> 02:05:09.836 region:rollup2
NOT REPEAT OFFENDERS THAT'S WHY

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:11.704 region:rollup2
THE COURT IS WILLING TO REDUCE

02:05:09.836 --> 02:05:13.139 region:rollup2
THEM? SO WE ASK THE COMMITTEE TO

02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:15.441 region:rollup2
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IS

02:05:13.139 --> 02:05:17.377 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A A BILL THAT'S

02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:19.212 region:rollup2
ENHANCING SENTENCES OR PUNISHING

02:05:17.377 --> 02:05:21.814 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HARSHLY THIS IS A BILL

02:05:19.212 --> 02:05:23.916 region:rollup2
THAT IS SQUARE IN LINE WITH THE

02:05:21.814 --> 02:05:26.185 region:rollup2
IT INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:28.121 region:rollup2
IN TREATING REPEAT DI Y.

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:29.822 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF

02:05:28.121 --> 02:05:31.357 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF DUI FATALITIES

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:33.059 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE BECAUSE BY REPEAT TO

02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:34.527 region:rollup2
YOU AYE OFFENDERS AGAIN THIS IS

02:05:33.059 --> 02:05:35.094 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE

02:05:34.527 --> 02:05:35.862 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS DONE IN THE

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:37.764 region:rollup2
PAST.

02:05:35.862 --> 02:05:39.866 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR THAT

02:05:37.764 --> 02:05:42.668 region:rollup2
NEGLIGIBLE NUMBER OF AFFECTED

02:05:39.866 --> 02:05:43.736 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IS AT MOST

02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:45.104 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT IT'S

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:46.739 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD GET

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:48.241 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT WOULD LIKELY

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:49.709 region:rollup2
IF THEY DIDN'T GET PROBATION AND

02:05:48.241 --> 02:05:51.577 region:rollup2
WERE SENTENCED TO PRISON. GET

02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:53.012 region:rollup2
THAT MID TERM OF ADDITIONAL YEAR

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:54.981 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:56.249 region:rollup2
NEGLIGIBLE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

02:05:54.981 --> 02:05:59.052 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY VERY

02:05:56.249 --> 02:06:00.987 region:rollup2

WILL HORSE THIS MORNING.

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:08.454 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS ALMOST AN EXACT

02:07:05.518 --> 02:07:09.021 region:rollup2
REWRITE OF SB SIXTY SEVEN WHICH

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:11.557 region:rollup2
DIED IN COMMITTEE LAST YEAR.

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:15.027 region:rollup2
AND.

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:17.763 region:rollup2
WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE AT

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:21.734 region:rollup2
ONE TIES JUDGE'S HANDS JUDGES

02:07:17.763 --> 02:07:23.870 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCRETION. TO AS ON. THAT

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:25.705 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS SAID SEVENTEEN BE

02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:28.407 region:rollup2

SEVENTEEN BE. REDUCED SO.

02:07:28.407 --> 02:07:33.880 region:rollup2
A WHAT IS KNOWN AS A WAFFLER TO

02:07:32.745 --> 02:07:36.048 region:rollup2
A MISDEMEANOR.

02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:37.683 region:rollup2
AND FELONIES THAT ARE CHARGED AS

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:40.553 region:rollup2
FELONIES.

02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:42.788 region:rollup2
ON THEM GO TO A PRELIMINARY

02:07:40.553 --> 02:07:44.991 region:rollup2
HEARING AND ASK THAT HEARING THE

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:46.692 region:rollup2
JUDGE HEARS THE EVIDENCE.

02:07:44.991 --> 02:07:49.395 region:rollup2
AND HAS THE DISCRETION AT THAT

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:51.597 region:rollup2
POINT TO REDUCE THE OFFENSE TO A

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:53.332 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR. BASED ON THE FACTS

02:07:51.597 --> 02:07:55.768 region:rollup2
OF THE CASE.

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:57.770 region:rollup2
SO BAD THIS IS NOT JUST

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:59.972 region:rollup2
REDUCING IT AFTER SOMEONE HAS

02:07:57.770 --> 02:08:02.141 region:rollup2
BEEN CONVICTED THIS IS SOMEONE

02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:04.410 region:rollup2
WHO ACTUALLY HERE'S THE EVIDENCE

02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:05.878 region:rollup2
AND FEELS THAT. THIS IS THE

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:07.880 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE OUTCOME.

02:08:05.878 --> 02:08:09.649 region:rollup2
.

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:11.684 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF THE

02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:13.619 region:rollup2
BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED IF IT HAS

02:08:11.684 --> 02:08:15.788 region:rollup2
THE MONEY APPLAUD BAT BUT THE

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:17.523 region:rollup2
WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IT

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:19.525 region:rollup2
WAS ACTUALLY. PRECLUDED.

02:08:17.523 --> 02:08:22.195 region:rollup2
THE JUDGE.

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:24.130 region:rollup2
REDUCING IT AT THAT POINT.

02:08:22.195 --> 02:08:25.865 region:rollup2
IT TIES THE JUDGE'S HANDS AND

02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:27.233 region:rollup2
IT SAYS.

02:08:25.865 --> 02:08:30.102 region:rollup2
AHLAM IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN

02:08:27.233 --> 02:08:32.271 region:rollup2
CHARGED WITH A FELONY DUI.

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:35.775 region:rollup2
AND TEN YEARS LATER YOU GET

02:08:32.271 --> 02:08:37.376 region:rollup2

02:08:35.775 --> 02:08:39.645 region:rollup2
VIGNETTE YOU WILL BE PUNISHED

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:41.514 region:rollup2
WITH A FELONY. AND THAT IS NOT

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:43.916 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

02:08:41.514 --> 02:08:44.584 region:rollup2
IT GIVES INSTEAD OF GIVING POWER

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:46.385 region:rollup2
TO BOTH.

02:08:44.584 --> 02:08:49.055 region:rollup2
THE.

02:08:46.385 --> 02:08:50.957 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL SYSTEM THE JUDGE AND TO

02:08:49.055 --> 02:08:51.591 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IT

02:08:50.957 --> 02:08:57.396 region:rollup2
VIOLATES THE SEPARATION SHIFTED

02:08:51.591 --> 02:08:59.565 region:rollup2
TO THE PROSECUTOR TO

02:08:57.396 --> 02:09:01.400 region:rollup2
DECIDE.

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:03.469 region:rollup2
IT ALSO REDUCES THE.

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:05.204 region:rollup2
.

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:08.641 region:rollup2
THE INCENTIVE FOR.

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:09.842 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED.

02:09:08.641 --> 02:09:12.612 region:rollup2
OF FELONY DE YOU WISE TO

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:14.947 region:rollup2
REHABILITATE THEMSELVES.

02:09:12.612 --> 02:09:17.116 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY'RE AWARDED

02:09:14.947 --> 02:09:18.417 region:rollup2
LATER FOR THEIR EFFORTS.

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:20.219 region:rollup2
AND IT'S REDUCED AFTER THAT

02:09:18.417 --> 02:09:22.255 region:rollup2
CONVICTION.

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:25.958 region:rollup2
ALL IT WILL STILL REMAIN PRIOR

02:09:22.255 --> 02:09:29.128 region:rollup2
BULL AND FOR TEN YEARS LATER. SO

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:31.364 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING FOR YOU TO VOTE NO

02:09:29.128 --> 02:09:33.466 region:rollup2

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.943 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:45.578 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY FOUR

02:09:43.943 --> 02:09:46.879 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE AN UNPRECEDENTED

02:09:45.578 --> 02:09:49.115 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION TO THE PROVISION OF

02:09:46.879 --> 02:09:49.882 region:rollup2
PENAL CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN BE

02:09:49.115 --> 02:09:51.384 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDES THAT A REDUCTION

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:52.985 region:rollup2
TO A MISDEMEANOR UNDER THAT

02:09:51.384 --> 02:09:55.554 region:rollup2
SECTION. MAKES THE CRIME A

02:09:52.985 --> 02:09:58.524 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR FOR ALL PURPOSES.

02:09:55.554 --> 02:10:01.093 region:rollup2
AND EVEN AS I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:09:58.524 --> 02:10:02.495 region:rollup2
THE BILL IS TO BE AMENDED THAT

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:04.830 region:rollup2
THAT IS STILL AN UNPRECEDENTED

02:10:02.495 --> 02:10:06.999 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION. ON I WOULD ALSO JUST

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:08.200 region:rollup2
TURN AROUND WHAT THE WITNESS I

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:10.136 region:rollup2
IN SUPPORT OF THE THE BILL SAID

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:12.672 region:rollup2
AND SAY. IN THE VERY RARE

02:10:10.136 --> 02:10:13.973 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE SOMEONE WAS

02:10:12.672 --> 02:10:16.976 region:rollup2
CHARGED AND SENTENCED TO A ON A

02:10:13.973 --> 02:10:18.044 region:rollup2
FELONY DUI AND IT'S LATER ABLE

02:10:16.976 --> 02:10:20.313 region:rollup2
THROUGH EVIDENCE OF THEIR

02:10:18.044 --> 02:10:22.048 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION TO. GET THE JUDGE

02:10:20.313 --> 02:10:23.416 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE IT TO A MISDEMEANOR

02:10:22.048 --> 02:10:25.851 region:rollup2
WHICH IS HOW I UNDERSTAND IT

02:10:23.416 --> 02:10:27.720 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY NOW. THAT THAT SAYS

02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:29.755 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PERSON THAT

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.957 region:rollup2
THAT THE JUDGE IS RECOGNIZING

02:10:29.755 --> 02:10:33.793 region:rollup2
AND THAT SHOULD CARRY FORWARD

02:10:31.957 --> 02:10:35.428 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THE SITUATION WHERE

02:10:33.793 --> 02:10:37.396 region:rollup2

IT'S THE ORDERS LAW AS LONG AS

THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED I THINK

02:20:25.684 --> 02:20:29.788 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL ANATA TO

02:20:27.452 --> 02:20:31.023 region:rollup2
CREATE THIS CONFUSION.

02:20:29.788 --> 02:20:33.225 region:rollup2

DO THINK AND AND THAT'S WHAT I

02:21:21.273 --> 02:21:24.242 region:rollup2
THINK A CONCERN FOR US AS WELL

02:21:22.607 --> 02:21:26.011 region:rollup2
AS A FOR HAVING THAT MORE GLOBAL

02:21:24.242 --> 02:21:27.946 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ON HOW BEST TO REMOVE

02:21:26.011 --> 02:21:29.247 region:rollup2
BARRIERS BECAUSE. OPERATION IT'S

REMOVING BARRIERS AND AND

SEEK THE RELIEF THAT THERE UP

02:21:33.652 --> 02:21:37.055 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR I DO THINK THERE

02:21:35.487 --> 02:21:38.256 region:rollup2
COULD CERTAINLY BE CONFLICTS AND

02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:40.225 region:rollup2
ARE ONE OF THESE NOT BEEN ABLE

02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:40.859 region:rollup2
TO WORK IN LIGHT OF THE OTHER.

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:41.593 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE ARE THE

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:42.661 region:rollup2
TWO BILLS.

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:44.229 region:rollup2
I THINK I THINK THIS PARTICULAR

02:21:42.661 --> 02:21:45.564 region:rollup2
BILL AND WE BELIEVE IT'S RD

02:21:44.229 --> 02:21:46.498 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BEING DONE UNDER

02:21:45.564 --> 02:21:47.733 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

02:21:46.498 --> 02:21:48.867 region:rollup2
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S

02:21:47.733 --> 02:21:50.202 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS ON WHAT THE COUNTY

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:51.436 region:rollup2
JAILS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

02:21:50.202 --> 02:21:52.704 region:rollup2
NOTICE UNDER THIS THAT SEPARATE

02:21:51.436 --> 02:21:54.239 region:rollup2
FROM OUR P. SO.

02:21:52.704 --> 02:21:55.507 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF THAT

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:56.942 region:rollup2
PROBATION REFERENCE IN THIS BILL

02:21:55.507 --> 02:21:58.043 region:rollup2
STRICKEN DOT IT'S ALREADY

02:21:56.942 --> 02:21:59.544 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AND THEREFORE THAT

02:21:58.043 --> 02:22:01.213 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH ANY

02:21:59.544 --> 02:22:02.180 region:rollup2
OTHER MEASURES HAPPENING. IN

02:22:01.213 --> 02:22:04.049 region:rollup2
LIKE A COMET THROUGH THE CHAIR I

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:05.550 region:rollup2
THINK THE DISTINCTION AS I

02:22:04.049 --> 02:22:06.952 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT IS THE OTHER.

02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:09.588 region:rollup2
HAD TO DO WITH CONVICTIONS AS

02:22:06.952 --> 02:22:11.723 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO A REST I THINK THAT'S

02:22:09.588 --> 02:22:12.657 region:rollup2
A VERY DISTINCT DIFFERENCE.

02:22:11.723 --> 02:22:14.459 region:rollup2
IT IS ALSO A SURPLUS IS MAKING

02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:15.894 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THERE'S POSTING SO

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:17.963 region:rollup2
THAT THE INDIVIDUAL KNOWS THEY

02:22:15.894 --> 02:22:19.364 region:rollup2
CAN SEE AND READ AND BE CLEAR

02:22:17.963 --> 02:22:20.665 region:rollup2
ASSIST MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:22.000 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF

02:22:20.665 --> 02:22:24.269 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.704 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE STILL FOLKS OUT

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:27.205 region:rollup2
THERE THAT DON'T KNOW YOU SO IT

02:22:25.704 --> 02:22:28.807 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE DONE IN MAY BE COVERED

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:30.675 region:rollup2
IN CURRENT LAW BUT THIS GOES THE

02:22:28.807 --> 02:22:33.278 region:rollup2
EXTRA STEP TO SAY. WE'RE GOING

02:22:30.675 --> 02:22:34.880 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN TAKE AN

02:22:33.278 --> 02:22:36.048 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL EFFORT TO POST THE

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:37.816 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:22:36.048 --> 02:22:39.217 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE YOU WOULD POST AND

02:22:37.816 --> 02:22:40.719 region:rollup2
LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE AN

02:22:39.217 --> 02:22:42.788 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CALL.

02:22:40.719 --> 02:22:44.289 region:rollup2

AND LET SOMEONE KNOW CAN PICK MY

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:47.592 region:rollup2
CHILD UP TODAY THAT YOU HAVE

APPLY HERE THAT YOU HAVE THIS AS

02:22:49.127 --> 02:22:54.533 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY. OF THAT.

02:22:51.696 --> 02:22:55.700 region:rollup2
EXPUNGEMENT IS IT MAY NOT BE

02:22:54.533 --> 02:22:57.068 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC BUT THAT THERE IS AN

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:59.037 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY GO THROUGH A PROCESS

THE IDEA OF A YOU KNOW RAPING AN

THAT'S WRONG. BUT THIS BILL IS

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:35.546 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY. THE UNDERLYING

I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR AS WAS

INDICATED BY THE. OPPOSITION

03:18:10.112 --> 03:18:14.249 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT THE LGBT

03:18:12.214 --> 03:18:15.317 region:rollup2

AND.

03:18:17.219 --> 03:18:20.622 region:rollup2
WE WE NEED TO SUPPORT THAT

03:18:19.187 --> 03:18:22.324 region:rollup2
EFFORT VERY GENUINELY BUT I HAVE

03:18:20.622 --> 03:18:24.960 region:rollup2
TO TELL YOU THAT. POST FUNDS ARE

03:18:22.324 --> 03:18:26.828 region:rollup2

03:18:24.960 --> 03:18:28.430 region:rollup2
AND HAVING WHAT WE'RE HAVING A

03:18:26.828 --> 03:18:29.898 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUS.

03:18:28.430 --> 03:18:30.866 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY MEETING THE CURRENT

03:18:29.898 --> 03:18:33.001 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS THAT.

03:18:30.866 --> 03:18:34.836 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY EXPECTED TO BE

03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:36.505 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHED AND SO.

03:18:34.836 --> 03:18:38.540 region:rollup2
MY OPPOSITION TO THIS IS MERELY

03:18:36.505 --> 03:18:39.541 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT.

03:18:38.540 --> 03:18:41.209 region:rollup2
THE PATHWAY IS NOT DOABLE AT

03:18:39.541 --> 03:18:42.310 region:rollup2
THIS TIME.

03:18:41.209 --> 03:18:44.913 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE POST FUNDS.

03:18:42.310 --> 03:18:45.814 region:rollup2
.

03:18:44.913 --> 03:18:47.516 region:rollup2
ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC RIGHT NOW

03:18:45.814 --> 03:18:49.317 region:rollup2
IS THE FUNDING WITH WITH MANY

03:18:47.516 --> 03:18:49.484 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE. AT OUR GREAT STATE

03:18:49.317 --> 03:18:50.786 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:18:49.484 --> 03:18:53.054 region:rollup2
.

03:18:50.786 --> 03:18:54.623 region:rollup2
AND ALSO JUST AS A CONSIDERATION

03:18:53.054 --> 03:18:56.591 region:rollup2
PUSH FUNDS ARE USUALLY.

03:18:54.623 --> 03:18:58.794 region:rollup2
USED FOR TRAINING.

03:18:56.591 --> 03:18:59.928 region:rollup2
FOR PUBLIC AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:18:58.794 --> 03:19:01.029 region:rollup2
LGBT IS PART OF OUR PUBLIC AS

03:18:59.928 --> 03:19:03.064 region:rollup2
WELL.

03:19:01.029 --> 03:19:03.899 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

03:19:03.064 --> 03:19:05.100 region:rollup2
PART OF THE FOCUS OF I

03:19:03.899 --> 03:19:06.968 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY USED TO

03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:08.737 region:rollup2
ALSO ADDRESS.

03:19:06.968 --> 03:19:10.906 region:rollup2
THE INNER WORKINGS WITH THOSE IN

03:19:08.737 --> 03:19:11.406 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE LGBT.

03:19:10.906 --> 03:19:12.941 region:rollup2
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

03:19:11.406 --> 03:19:14.543 region:rollup2
.

03:19:12.941 --> 03:19:16.378 region:rollup2
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

03:19:14.543 --> 03:19:17.779 region:rollup2
TO TO FOCUS ON. BUT I'M NOT SURE

03:19:16.378 --> 03:19:19.548 region:rollup2
THE POST FUNDING IS THE WAY TO

03:19:17.779 --> 03:19:21.049 region:rollup2

THAT.

03:19:22.751 --> 03:19:25.987 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE DOABLE.

03:19:24.352 --> 03:19:27.189 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I CERTAINLY THINK THE

03:19:25.987 --> 03:19:27.389 region:rollup2

03:21:38.353 --> 03:21:41.356 region:rollup2
THIS BILL REMOVES A SET OF

03:21:39.688 --> 03:21:42.657 region:rollup2
OWNERS FIREARMS REGULATIONS ON

03:21:41.356 --> 03:21:44.059 region:rollup2
LAW ABIDING CITIZENS BY

REPEALING THE MISGUIDED AND

03:21:44.059 --> 03:21:49.564 region:rollup2
MISLEADING. UNSAFE HANDGUN LAW.

03:21:47.362 --> 03:21:51.433 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY OF A FIREARM IN IS

03:21:49.564 --> 03:21:54.069 region:rollup2
AND HOW IT IS USED NOT IN ITS

03:21:51.433 --> 03:21:55.070 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE OR ITS DESIGN.

03:21:54.069 --> 03:21:56.404 region:rollup2
GUN CONTROL MEASURES LIKE THE

03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:58.273 region:rollup2
UNSEEN GUN LAW DO NOT MAKE THE

CONTROL ADVOCATES FEEL GOOD

03:21:59.407 --> 03:22:02.077 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY

03:22:00.709 --> 03:22:03.678 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING.

03:22:02.077 --> 03:22:05.246 region:rollup2
BUT IN REALITIES THESE LAWS ARE

03:22:03.678 --> 03:22:06.982 region:rollup2
ONLY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT

03:22:05.246 --> 03:22:08.183 region:rollup2
FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS TO OWN

03:22:06.982 --> 03:22:09.551 region:rollup2
A FIREARM. AND THEY DO

03:22:08.183 --> 03:22:10.919 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO STOP

03:22:09.551 --> 03:22:12.087 region:rollup2
CRIMINALS.

03:22:10.919 --> 03:22:13.622 region:rollup2
THE TRAGEDY THE FLORIDA HIGH

THE NATION.

03:22:16.458 --> 03:22:19.961 region:rollup2
WAS THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT IF

03:22:18.393 --> 03:22:20.495 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAWS IT BEEN ENFORCED

03:22:19.961 --> 03:22:21.663 region:rollup2
THE TRAGIC WOULD NOT HAVE

03:22:20.495 --> 03:22:23.598 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

03:22:21.663 --> 03:22:25.200 region:rollup2
IF DEPUTIES ACTUALLY DONE THEIR

03:22:23.598 --> 03:22:27.936 region:rollup2
JOB WHEN THEY WENT TO THE THIS

03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:29.337 region:rollup2
TROUBLED TEENS HOUSE THIRTY NINE

03:22:27.936 --> 03:22:31.339 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TIMES THIS TRAGEDY

03:22:29.337 --> 03:22:33.708 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT OCCURRED. IF THE FBI

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:35.944 region:rollup2
HAD DONE ITS JOB IT WAS NOTIFIED

03:22:33.708 --> 03:22:37.979 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS AN UNSAVED PERSON

03:22:35.944 --> 03:22:39.581 region:rollup2
WITH UNSAVED DESIGNS.

03:22:37.979 --> 03:22:41.549 region:rollup2
THIS TRAGEDY WOULD NOT HAVE

03:22:39.581 --> 03:22:43.485 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IF THE ARM TO GET BT.

03:22:41.549 --> 03:22:46.554 region:rollup2
THEY IT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE

03:22:43.485 --> 03:22:48.523 region:rollup2

03:22:46.554 --> 03:22:50.492 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS IN DANGER.

03:22:48.523 --> 03:22:51.026 region:rollup2
IF HE HAD ACTUALLY ACTED.

03:22:50.492 --> 03:22:52.727 region:rollup2
NONE OF THESE THINGS WOULD

03:22:51.026 --> 03:22:54.429 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

03:22:52.727 --> 03:22:55.797 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S BE VERY CLEAR.

03:22:54.429 --> 03:22:57.365 region:rollup2
LAWS THAT HAMPER LEGAL GUN

03:22:55.797 --> 03:22:58.199 region:rollup2

AMENDMENT DO NOT MAKE US SAFER.

03:23:00.602 --> 03:23:04.539 region:rollup2
THE UNSAFE HANDGUN LAW PROVIDES

03:23:02.804 --> 03:23:05.240 region:rollup2
THE ILLUSION OF SAFETY.

03:23:04.539 --> 03:23:07.475 region:rollup2
WHILE VIOLATING OUR

03:23:05.240 --> 03:23:08.910 region:rollup2

VIOLENCE.

03:23:44.179 --> 03:23:55.323 region:rollup2
MY PREDECESSORS WORKED EXTREMELY

03:23:54.656 --> 03:23:55.757 region:rollup2
HARD IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES TO

03:23:55.323 --> 03:23:56.224 region:rollup2

03:23:55.757 --> 03:23:56.791 region:rollup2

PASSED.

03:23:57.058 --> 03:24:02.197 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT LAW TO BE

03:23:59.494 --> 03:24:04.532 region:rollup2
STUNNINGLY SUCCESSFUL.

03:24:02.197 --> 03:24:06.334 region:rollup2
FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TRUE HOPE

03:24:04.532 --> 03:24:08.002 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT RATE

03:24:06.334 --> 03:24:10.572 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA FELL BY MORE THAN

03:24:10.572 --> 03:24:14.209 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT.

03:24:12.140 --> 03:24:15.844 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO CDC DATA THERE MAY

03:24:14.209 --> 03:24:17.712 region:rollup2
BE MANY REASONS FOR THAT BUT I

03:24:15.844 --> 03:24:19.481 region:rollup2
WOULD OFFER ONE OF THE REASONS

03:24:17.712 --> 03:24:22.317 region:rollup2
IS HANDGUNS ARE NOW SAFER.

03:24:19.481 --> 03:24:24.786 region:rollup2

03:24:22.317 --> 03:24:27.655 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THAT HANDGUNS MEET

03:24:24.786 --> 03:24:29.991 region:rollup2
BASIC CONSUMER SAFETY STANDARDS

03:24:27.655 --> 03:24:34.763 region:rollup2
SUCH AS PASSING A DROP TEST.

03:24:29.991 --> 03:24:35.864 region:rollup2
AND AND MISS OF FIRING TESTS.

03:24:34.763 --> 03:24:38.600 region:rollup2
COMMONSENSE REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:24:35.864 --> 03:24:40.468 region:rollup2

03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:41.436 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN.

03:24:40.468 --> 03:24:43.338 region:rollup2

03:24:49.377 --> 03:24:53.515 region:rollup2
PREVALENT AT THE TIME. AND

03:24:51.312 --> 03:24:54.816 region:rollup2
COMMONLY USED IN CRIME SO I

03:24:53.515 --> 03:24:56.551 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THE LAW HAS BEEN A

03:24:54.816 --> 03:24:58.486 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

03:24:56.551 --> 03:25:00.922 region:rollup2
IN ITS ORIGINAL INTENT

03:24:58.486 --> 03:25:02.991 region:rollup2
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE OTHER

03:25:00.922 --> 03:25:04.559 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS WERE ADDING COLLUDED.

03:25:02.991 --> 03:25:06.661 region:rollup2
ARE OTHER REQUIREMENTS WERE

03:25:04.559 --> 03:25:08.363 region:rollup2
ADDED INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT

03:25:06.661 --> 03:25:09.130 region:rollup2

PREVENT ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS AND

03:25:14.602 --> 03:25:17.872 region:rollup2
THEN LATER THE MICROSCOPIC

03:25:16.137 --> 03:25:20.208 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT WAS ADDED.

03:25:17.872 --> 03:25:21.943 region:rollup2
THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE TO

03:25:20.208 --> 03:25:23.811 region:rollup2
FURTHER PREVENT ACCIDENTS

03:25:21.943 --> 03:25:25.947 region:rollup2
SHOOTINGS AND ACTUALLY TO HELP

03:25:23.811 --> 03:25:27.549 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SOLVING CRIME. AND

03:25:25.947 --> 03:25:29.317 region:rollup2
APPREHENDING ARMED CRIMINALS

03:25:27.549 --> 03:25:31.786 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY DO MORE HARM AS

03:25:29.317 --> 03:25:33.855 region:rollup2
WE'VE DISCUSSED ALOT THAT EARLY.

03:25:31.786 --> 03:25:35.623 region:rollup2
EARLIER HEARING REGARDING THE

03:25:33.855 --> 03:25:38.293 region:rollup2
MICROSCOPIC REQUIREMENT.

03:25:35.623 --> 03:25:39.727 region:rollup2
THERE'S DEBATE ON THAT OF WE

03:25:38.293 --> 03:25:42.096 region:rollup2
DISAGREE ABOUT THAT.

03:25:39.727 --> 03:25:44.465 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT CAN BE DONE OR NOT.

03:25:42.096 --> 03:25:44.933 region:rollup2

03:25:44.465 --> 03:25:47.235 region:rollup2
AND.

03:25:44.933 --> 03:25:49.170 region:rollup2
MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO LET THE

03:25:47.235 --> 03:25:50.638 region:rollup2
COURTS DECIDE ON THIS AND LET IT

03:25:49.170 --> 03:25:53.274 region:rollup2
PLAY OUT WE STILL BELIEVE THAT

03:25:50.638 --> 03:25:54.509 region:rollup2
IS VERY GOOD POLICY WANNA SEE

03:25:53.274 --> 03:25:56.444 region:rollup2
THAT ON FUTURE FIREARMS.
