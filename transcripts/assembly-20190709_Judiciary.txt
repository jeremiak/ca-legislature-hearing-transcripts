THANK YOU TAKE UP ITEM TO SB ONE SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY 2%. OF WITH THE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ABOUT TO START I APPRECIATE THE EXTENSION THAT COURTESY AND SO WHAT. WE WILL EMPATHIZE WITH YOUR LONG DAY. NO YOU DON'T HAVE. OF I AM PLEASED THOUGH TWO PRESENTS SENATE BILL ONE SEVENTY SIX THIS IS THE ANNUAL BILL TO AUTHORIZE FEES. OF THE STATE BAR CAN CHARGE AN ATTORNEY IN ORDER TO BE LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ATTORNEYS FEES SO HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED IN TWENTY YEARS. AND LAST YEAR WE INSTRUCTED THE STATE AUDITOR TO AUDIT THE STATE BAR TO DETERMINE IF THERE SHOULD BE A FEE INCREASE AND IF SO WHAT THAT AMOUNT SHOULD BE. THE BILL IN PRINT REFLECTS THE FEE INCREASE SUGGESTED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THIS COMMITTEE A JUDGE THIS AMOUNT PURSUANT TO THE RIVER RESULTS OF THE RECENTLY RELEASED STUDY. BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE FEE INCREASE. BY TWENTY TWO DOLLARS. PURSUANT TO THIS BILL THEN THE LICENSING FEE IN TWENTY TWENTY WILL INCREASE BY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE DOLLARS. FROM THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS TO FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES A PROVISION TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF INCOME AN ATTORNEY CAN MAKE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR A 25% FEE DISCOUNT. REFLECTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR COST OF LIVING IT'S SECTOR. ANOTHER SUBSTANTIVE PROVISION OF THE BILL ALLOWS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF AFFINITY FUNDING -- PROGRAMS -- BY SHOULD TAKE AFFINITY PROGRAM FUNDING. TO QUALIFIED LEGAL SERVICE PROJECTS THE CALIFORNIA CHANGE LAWYERS. HOW WHICH IS THE NEW NAME FOR THE FILE THE CALIFORNIA BAR FOUNDATION? AND THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AMENDMENTS I AM ACCEPTING TODAY ENSURE AN EQUITABLE SPLIT BETWEEN THESE ORGANIZATIONS. AND THAT FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE AGAIN AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT IS. BEING SPUN OFF FROM. THE BAR IN ALL OF ITS MACHINATIONS AS IT EXISTED TO AND AS WE ADJUSTED IT A COUPLE YEARS AGO. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED EXPRESSES THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE STATE BAR BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BEGINNING. WITH THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION AND THE LEGISLATURE EXERCISING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE BAR. THE BILL INCLUDES OTHER NON CONTROVERSIAL PROVISIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE BAR WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S. EACH YEAR REGARDING THE FORTY DOLLAR LEGAL SERVICES OPT OUT LICENSING FEE AND THE VOLUNTARY JUSTICE GAP OPT IN FEE. IT'S MY HOPE THAT. A MEMBERS OF THE BAR WILL RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SERVICES TO TRY TO ASSURE JUSTICE IS AVAILABLE TO ALL PEOPLE -- AND REPORTING BACK TO THESE TO OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL AS WE TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT IF ANY NEXT STEPS WE SHOULD TAKE TO ENSURE THAT. THIS DOES BECOME. THE STANDARD FOR THE BAR. AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THE MORNING CHAIR. AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JASON LEE AND I'M THE CHAIR OF THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA BOARD OF TRUSTEES. HAVING BEEN APPOINTED BY THE SUPREME COURT TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE SINCE SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR. I AM PROUD AND HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ABOUT THE NEW STATE BAR. THE NATION'S BUSIEST AND LARGEST STATE BAR. SINCE MY TENURE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR YEARS AGO. WE HAVE BEEN STEADFAST IN WHAT HAS BEEN A LONG AN AT TIMES DIFFICULT ROAD TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK THE STATE AUDITOR IN LA L. BOTH OF WHOM SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME AND EFFORT. THESE PAST FEW MONTHS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE REVIEWS OF OUR AGENCY AT THE LEGISLATURE'S REQUEST. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THE GOOD WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. ALONGSIDE THE WORK OF SENATOR JACKSON AND HER COMMITTEE. WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE ABSOLUTELY INSTRUMENTAL FOR THIS AGENCY TO EMBRACE TRUE REFORM. THESE REFORMS INCLUDE. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE STATE BAR SCORE REGULATORY FUNCTION OF DISCIPLINE. THIS INCLUDES A COMPLETE RESTRUCTURE OF THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL. AND PRIORITIZING CASES THAT POSE THE MOST HARM TO THE PUBLIC. THIS RESTRUCTURING HAS REDUCED OUR BACKLOG FOR THE HIGHEST PRIORITY CASES BY ONE THIRD. WE HAVE STEPPED UP OUR EFFORTS TO STOP THE UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW. INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A SPECIAL TEAM FOCUSED ON IMMIGRATION FRAUD. WE HAVE INCREASED LAW ENFORCEMENT REFERRALS OF THIS MONTH MISCONDUCT BY OVER 50%. WE HAVE TRIMS MORE THAN FIVE POINT TWO MILLION. FOR MY BUDGET. RESTRUCTURED AN AUTOMATED PROCESS SEES. AND EXECUTED OTHER SIGNIFICANT COST SAVING MEASURES. WE HAVE RENEWED OUR FOCUS ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION LEGAL SYSTEM IN AIM TO COLLECT EVIDENCE. GAUGE OUTCOMES AND BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE THOSE OUTCOMES IN LAW SCHOOL AND PROFESSIONAL RETENTION AMONG OTHER AREAS. BUT AFTER TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT A FEE INCREASE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND COST OF DOING BUSINESS OF GROUND. GET A FUNDING HAS NOT. HAD NORMALLY FOR INFLATIONARY JUST ESTIMATE OUR LICENSING FEE WOULD BE NEAR FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. I PRECHED I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY IN PROVING IF THE INCREASE IN LIGHT OF THE BAR BARS PASSED. I RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THE PAST WILL REMAIN THERE. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR REFORMS ARE PREPARED OR AGENCY TO MOVE FORWARD AND FILL OUR MISSION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION. WE CANNOT HOWEVER DO SO WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I FELT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE SERVICE WITH. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS. MY NAME IS PATRICE WILL THEIR GLASS I'M AN ATTORNEY IN THE STATE BAR'S OFFICE OF CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL IN LOS ANGELES. I ALSO SERVE AS THE LOS ANGELES CHAPTER PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BAR'S SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND CHAPTER. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE SEVENTY SIX BY SENATOR JACKSON'S. I'M FIRST STATE PARKS EMPLOYEES WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR JACKSON FOR HER LEADERSHIP. WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE BAR. SENATOR JACKSON'S LEADERSHIP HAS FACILITATED MUCH NEEDED CHANGE AT THE STATE BAR AND THE PUBLIC IS TRULY BENEFITTED FROM THOSE CHANGES AS HAVE THE EMPLOYEES. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK CHAIR SO IN THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN PASSING SB ONE SEVENTY SIX WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY CONTINUE. TO DRIVE THE STATE BAR. STATE BARS NOT HAD A LICENSING FEE INCREASE IN TWENTY YEARS EVEN THOUGH COSTS HAVE CONTINUED TO RISE. AS A RESULT OF A GOOD CONTRACT AND NEW LEADERSHIP WORKING CONDITIONS FOR STATE BAR EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE BAR KNOWLEDGE THAT EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS NEEDED TO BE ALIGNED WITH OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION THE STATE BAR RECENTLY LAUNCHED TO CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS USED BY EMPLOYEES IN OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS OFFICE OF CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL OFFICE OF PROBATION AND THE STATE PARK COURT. AS WE BECOME PROFICIENT WITH THE SYSTEMS WE ANTICIPATE INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY [inaudible] AN EFFICIENCY. NEW CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS HAVE ALSO FACILITATED THE ABILITY FOR MANY EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS. RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RELEASED THE AUDIT AS REQUIRED BY THE LEGISLATION ENACTED LAST YEAR AT THE REQUEST OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE RESULTS OF THAT AUDIT INCLUDE A FEE INCREASE TO SUPPORT THE STATE BAR STAFFING NEEDS AS WELL AS FUNDING FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. WE SUPPORT THE IN THE FEE INCREASE AS RECOMMENDED BY THE AUDITOR WE BELIEVE THAT THE RECOMMENDED FUNDING STRUCTURE PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE STATE BAR EXACTLY WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED LAST YEAR. AND PROTECTING THE PUBLIC THE STATE BAR HAS A DUTY TO REVIEW AND MAKE A DETERMINATION REGARDING EVERY COMPLAINT OF ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT AND THE ARE NOT AUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW. IT'S TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. IN ADDITION AS A REASON AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT LAUNCH OF OUR ONLINE COMPLAINT FORM MANY EMPLOYEES IN THE OFFICE OF CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL. HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THEIR WORKLOAD. INCREASED WORKLOADS AN INEFFICIENT BERMAN PLOYS IT'S EXCUSE ME INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES CREATES A NATURAL BACKLOG WE BELIEVE THE NINETEEN NEW HIRES AS RECOMMENDED BY THE AUDITOR WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE BACKLOG IN ENABLE US TO PROCESS CASES WITHIN THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME. WE ARE SUPPORT ALSO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HIS RECOMMENDATION THAT THE STATE BAR UNDERGO THE SAME BUDGET PRICE ASKED PROCESS AS OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. THE INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS WILL BRING IS INSTRUMENTAL IN ENSURING THAT THE BAR CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE. LASTLY ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT IN THE BILL THIS YEAR WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION OF A MULTI YEAR FEE BILL. WHICH WOULD ASSIST THE STATE BARNES FISCAL PLANNING AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE STATE BAR EMPLOYEES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S JAKE YOU TIME I'M INVESTIGATOR AT THAT STATE PARK CALIFORNIANS CENSUS GO OFFICE.

I'M HERE TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR ITS SENATE BILL ONE SEVENTY SIX I THESE RESOURCES ARE THANK YOU AT THIS POINT WILL TAKE NAME AND AFFILIATION AND YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU KNOW FOR THE TESTIMONY THANK YOU. A COUPLE OF LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING CATHERINE BLAKE FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IN THE VICE CHAIR OF THE ACCESS COMMISSION IN SUPPORT OF THE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ON GOING SUPPORT OF LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAMS. REBECCA MARKETS REPRESENTING THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS -- MISTER CHAIRMAN NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IS THAT ALRIGHT PLEASE OKAY. SO US PROBABLY MORE FOR THE BAR THEN FOR THE AUTHOR ALTHOUGH. IT'S ALL RIGHT I'M HAPPY TO SIT HERE AND LISTEN I'M SORRY. I DON'T JUST QUESTIONS THAT AT I WANT TO MAKE SURE ON THE RECORD -- FIRST I WANT TO KNOW -- THE CURRENT STATUS OF BARS COLLECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND PRIVACY RISK THAT'S CREATED BY THAT WHAT. AT WHERE ARE WE ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY QUESTION AND WHAT IS BEING DONE WITH THE CURRENT. NUMBER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. SO THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS THAT THE ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED I KNOW HAS UNDERGONE REVIEW BY OUR OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL. TO ENSURE THAT WERE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW IN THAT AREA. THANK YOU FOR THAT FOLLOW UP. OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN ADDITION TO THAT IS WE'VE TAKEN A SECOND REVIEW OF THE OVERALL APPLICATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING. IMPLIED IN THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING THAT WOULD. OTHERWISE ACT AS A DETERRENT TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS -- THAT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO PAUSE IN FILLING OUT THE APPLICATION. I THINK THE TENSION -- WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER HAS BEEN CONFLICTING BUT COMPETING STATUTES -- ONE REQUIRING THE COLLECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS -- FOR CHILD SUPPORT AND THEN YOURYOUR AUTHORED FILLED RELATING TO ENSURING THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE ACCESS TO A LICENSE. AB SO WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLE BUT WE THINK WE WILL I KNOW WE HAVE NOW COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND WE JUST TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER TRIP WIRES THERE. OKAY A PAYCHECK AT OUR I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN PLACE FOR LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING OPTIONS -- ANY PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY WE'RE GIVING -- VOLUNTARILY ARE SERVING ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING INHIBITING THE GRANTING LEGAL SERVICES MONEY TO UNDOCUMENTED. IMMIGRANTS -- AND THOSE GRANTS GOING -- TO BUT THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE NOTHING IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE GRANTS ARE ACTUALLY BE GIVING TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE A HAVE CREATED. A WAY TO SERVE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS SO WE ARE STILL ARE WE STILL GIVING MONEY TO FOLKS WHO REFUSED TO SERVE. SO I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION OTHER THAN. MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE STATE BAR'S FINDING IS DRIVEN BY THE ABLE TO FUNDING -- SO IT'S VERY FORMULAIC IN IN THE SENSE OF THE GRANTS THAT ARE GIVEN. UP BUT WE SOON THEY'RE OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THIS COMMITTEE -- IN EXPLORING ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THAT FUNDING CAN GO TO THOSE CALIFORNIA'S THAT NEED IT MOST. YEAH I THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE NOT ALLOWING THEM AND AN EASY. AN EXCUSE OF SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS TO NOT SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS -- JUST BECAUSE THE FEDERAL LAW IS WHAT IT IS THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS -- TO AS WE HAVE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE FIGURED OUT WAYS. TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FUNDING AND SERVE UNDOCUMENTED -- CALIFORNIANS ABSOLUTELY -- MY NEXT QUESTION YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER TO BUT IT'S ONE I'VE ASKED. AND IT MAY TAKE. A LOT TO GET IT BUT DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE GENDER MAKEUP OF INACTIVE. ATTORNEYS. AB WE BELIEVE WE DO -- BASED ON THE RECENT SURVEYS THAT WE SENT OUT TO OUR LICENSEES WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE. NOW BUT WE ARE AWARE OF THE REQUEST AND WILL START GOING THROUGH SOME OF THAT INFORMATION TO PROVIDE YOUR STAFF AND YOU WITH THE DATA. MY CONCERN IS THAT SIGN AND WHERE I'VE I'VE ASKED OBVIOUSLY -- WHAT OTHER PROFESSIONS WHEN YOU -- DON'T PRACTICE REQUIRE YOU AFTER COURSE LAW SCHOOL AND THAT AND PASSING THE BAR TO ACTUALLY -- PAY A FEE TO IN ORDER TO ONE DAY. COME BACK IN PRACTICE -- I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS WE'VE ASKED ONE BECAUSE I WOULD GUESS THAT WOMEN OVERWHELMINGLY GO IN ACTIVE MORE THAN MEN -- BECAUSE OF CHILDREN AND OTHER REASONS -- AND INCREASING THAT FEE. IT IS SOMETHING I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT I I THINK THE FACT THAT WE CHARGE PEOPLE IS -- LUDICROUS BUT THE FACT T ACTUALLY INCREASING AND THIS MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE AND I AM CONCERNED WITH -- THE DISPARITIES THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO PLACE ON FOLKS WHO. HAVE. TO FOR OFTEN FAMILY REASONS THE WOMAN IS ONE WHO. MAY LEAVE THE PROFESSION FOR A WHILE. SO YOU WILL GET UP FOR ME. THIS GOES TO APPROPRIATE WILL WE GET AN ANSWER BEFORE PREPARATIONS. WE SO WE GOT A REQUEST LAST NIGHT. WE ARE MOVING TO ONE IDENTIFIED WHETHER WE HAVE THE INFORMATION I THINK WE WE BELIEVE WE DO -- AND WILL. MARSHALL THAT RESOURCES TO GET YOU THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OKAY AND I KNOW -- WHEN WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT OBVIOUSLY BUT I I'M REALLY CONCERNED OF OF WHY WE CAN'T SCALE -- FOR LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS WHO DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OR FOR FOLKS WHO WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE DOESN'T ALWAYS PAY YOUR BAR DUES. IN SOME. JOBS THEY DO FOR EXAMPLE AN ATTORNEY IN THE SENATE -- GETS THEIR PARTICIPATE FOR AN ATTORNEY IN ASSEMBLY DOES NOT ACCEPT I THINK. YOUR STAFF -- SO. AN ATTORNEY AND APPROPRIATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY DOES NOT GET THE BAR DUES PAID. IN TALK ABOUT STAFF NOT MEMBERS -- IN SO THERE'S THIS DISPARITY THAT I THINK AT GIVE AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS VERY LITTLE AFFECT ON HIGH INCOME EARNERS WHERE THEIR LAW FIRM PAYS THEIR FEES. AND HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE FACT ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY USING THEIR LOT AGREES TO SERVE THE PUBLIC -- I KNOWWE HAD ASKED FOR SCALENE AND FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I WAS TOLD THAT WAS A TAX SIR ANY OTHER WAY WE CAN -- RELIEVE THE BURDEN THAT THIS PLACES ON WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS WHAT WE WANT A LOT OF ATTORNEYS TO DO IS USE THEIR LAW DEGREE. TO SERVE POOR PEOPLE. PUBLIC DEFENDERS YEAH I'D LIKE TO IT JUST JUMP IN HERE I I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT GOING FORWARD I KEEP READING ABOUT HOW LAW FIRMS ARE MAKING RECORD PROFITS. ARE AND HOW. WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO STEP UP AND TO TO PERFORM LEGAL SERVICES TO TO USE THEIR LAW DEGREES FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS WELL. AND THAT THIS -- THIS BILL IS IS -- SILENT TO AS TO THAT IN PART OF IT IS AS YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT A TAX -- BUT I BUT I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT GOING FORWARD BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S LIKE THAT THE INCOME INEQUALITY WERE SEEN THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY. THE THE LAW THE SUCCESSFUL WELFARE LAW FIRMS ARE GETTING WEALTHIER. AND THERE ARE PEOPLE SCRAMBLING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS AS A PRACTICING ATTORNEYS I MIGHT SAY THAT THAT MIGHT BE AN INCENTIVE TO THINK ABOUT RUNNING FOR THE SENATE. THAT WE DO GET OUR BAR DUES PAID THEIR BUT I JUST THROW THAT OUT IS TO A PARENTHETICAL OBSERVATION AND NOT NECESSARILY WANT TO PAINT MAYBE DON'T TELL MY SENATOR THAT. WELL. THAT'S ALSO A POINT WELL TAKEN BUT I DO THINK THAT WE TO CERTAINLY NEED TO LOOK AT ADD TO THE SOME. BETTER WAY TO RECOGNIZE THE DISPARITIES BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES BUT IT'S CERTAINLY CONVERSATION I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN IN HAVING WOULD YOU BE WILLING AND AND JUST TO THINK ABOUT AND I ASK YOU TO TAKE IT NOW BUT I I WOULD. BE -- I I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN DO IT IN THIS BILL BUT I WOULD LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT LEAST TO BE ON THE HOOK -- FOR PAIN ARGUES FOR ATTORNEYS -- WHO WORK FOR THE STATE? AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN PLACE IN A SPELL BUT THAT'S OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THAT'S WHAT I THINK ARE THE MARVELOUS THAT WOULD BE A BUDGET. I WANT IT NOW. TOUGH TALK BUT I I MEAN I IN ALL HONESTY I'M I'M PAYING MY BARGES AND I HAVE DESPITE. MAKING VERY LITTLE MONEY AS AN ATTORNEY MY ENTIRE LIFE RIGHT. I'M. I THINK WHAT. IT THAT'S FINE I I'VE CHOSEN TO TO REMAIN ACTIVE AND DO THAT BUT OUR STAFF AND PEOPLE WHO -- YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE GIVEN LEAVE THEIR LEGAL. SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S WHOLLY UNFAIR ON THAT WE CONTINUE TO RAISE ARGUES ON ON FOLKS WHO ARE. DOING A PUBLIC SERVICE WITH THEIR LAW DEGREE -- I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED ON THIS BILL I'M GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY BUT I AM STILL CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE MAKING -- UNDER SIX FIGURES AS DOING LEGAL AID SERVICES THAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE RAISING THE COST OF DOING YOUR JOB -- AND MEANWHILE. THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT THE MOST DON'T PAY THEIR OWN PARTY WAS SO -- THERE'S JUST A OF A VERY. BIG DISPARITY I THINK AND AND THE EFFECT THAT THIS HAS ON WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE LAWYER STILL ANNOUNCED GOING TO PUBLIC SERVICE -- AGAIN THE THE QUESTION ON ON WHY WERE RAISING -- FEES FOR PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO BE AN ACTIVE I IT IT JUST IS BEYOND ME THEY'RE LITERALLY ACOSTA OF OF HAVING AND REMAINING AN ATTORNEY. WHAT OTHER PROFESSION HAS TO PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR JUST? TO REMAINING YOUR PROFESSION EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT PRACTICING. IF YOU'RE STAYING HOME WITH YOUR KIDS. I DIDN'T I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I THINK THAT THE IT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AS WE LOOKED AT THIS BAR DUES BILL WE HAVE TRIED TO REVAMP THE BAR WE TRY TO MAKE IT MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC -- WE'VE. NARROWED ITS FOCUS WE HAVE CUT THEM OFF AT THE KNEES IN SOME RESPECTS APPROPRIATELY SO I THINK AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN IMPLEMENT OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THEM. AND THIS IS THE MECHANISM FOR DUES HAVE HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN THE MECHANISM. AS FAR AS TOURING THIS I THINK THE POINT'S WELL TAKEN BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP THE BAR. BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE EXPECT AND DEMAND THAT IT TOO AND SO RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE THOSE CONCERNS I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THEM -- I AT THIS POINT TIME WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE THE BARK. OF THE MONEY IT NEEDS TO DO THE THINGS THAT WERE TELLING IT IT NEEDS TO DO AND I I WILL SAY I THANK YOU TO THE BAR FOR BEING RESPONSIVE I KNOW TO A LOT OF OUR QUESTIONS THROUGHOUT THE LAST. LONG AS WE'VE BEEN HERE -- AND AND WE HAVE BEEN REALLY TOUGH ON THE BAR. AM AND THE BAR HAS. STEPPED UP AND I DO I IN I MET WITH US YEAH YOU FOLKS I THINK THEY DESERVE. YOU KNOW. THIS MONEY -- MY MY PROBLEM IS -- THE REGRESSIVE NATURE BY WHICH WE ARE A SIGN IT TO ATTORNEYS AND SO I WOULD. BE MORE WILLING TO INCREASE ARGUES MORE FOR THOSE WHO AT ARE MAKING MORE. AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT. PROVIDING A DESCENDANT OF TO ACTUALLY DO PUBLIC SERVICE SO THAT'S MY CONCERNS AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THIS AND I KNOW WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ISSUES -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING DONE -- THIS YEAR I NOW I CAN'T GET A BUDGET ITEM DONE -- THAT. SOMETHING DONE IN IN TERMS OF AND EVEN THE SAME CALIFORNIA DOESN'T RESOLVE THE LEGAL AID ISSUE -- PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW IMMIGRATION. SPECIALISTS ARE ATTORNEYS WHO WHO ARE WORKING FOR NONPROFITS ME WE HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF FOLKS ARE NOT MAKING SIX FIGURES AND THIS IS A REAL BURDEN. EVERY TIME WE INCREASE. THE PARTY WAS SO THAT'S MY CONCERN MILLION FORWARD TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS PRESS. I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE THE THE COMMENTS FROM FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO -- THE THE DISPROPORTIONATE -- AMOUNT OF A BAR DUES THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED THE INACTIVE I THINK. IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IN THIS BILL BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO GIVE VOICE. TO BECAUSE IT IS AN INEQUITY IF WE HAVE AND I THINK THAT THE THE NUMBERS OF STATISTICS WILL BEAR OUT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE INACTIVE. ARE WOMEN. WHO DO PLAN TO RETURN TO TO ACTIVE PRACTICE? BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS I I KNOW IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP -- DURING OTHER HEARINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- BAR DUES AND INCREASING BAR DUES -- THE THE OTHER ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH IT -- THE MONEY THAT GOES TO THROUGH I'LL TO TO OUR LEGAL AIDS. IN MAKING SURE THAT. THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT SERVE THE UNDOCUMENTED MANY COMMITTEES TO SERVE. OUR PRIMARILY SPANISH SPEAKING AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE RECRUITMENT OF ATTORNEYS FOR MANY OF THOSE LEGAL AIDS. IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE SPANISH SPEAKERS. AND YET IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT THAT'S GIVEN -- TO THE TWO EIGHT COMMUNITY THAT SERVES ONLY ENGLISH SPEAKERS VERSUS THOSE WHO SERVE SPANISH SPEAKERS. AND I THINK MORE NEEDS TO BE. DONE TO EVALUATE HOW THAT IS DONE I I'VE BEEN A VOLUNTEER WITH OUR LEGAL AID FOR THIRTY YEARS FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS I'VE SERVED ON THE BOARD. FOR ALMOST AS LONG AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO TO GET MONEY FOR LEGAL SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR NUMBERS TOGETHER TO HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'RE SERVING -- OUR NUMBERS. NOT JUST OUR NUMBERS BUT THE NUMBERS FOR MANY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. OFTENTIMES ARE LOWER BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO SERVE SOMEONE WHO'S SPANISH SPEAKING AND HAVING TO TRANSLATE ALL THE DOCUMENTS. SO I DO ASK THAT WE CONSIDER THAT. MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE SERVE. EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA WHO NEEDS THE SERVICES OF AN ATTORNEY AND CANNOT AFFORD IT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- I I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS -- SENATOR -- BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT THAT THE STATE BAR NEEDS WE NEED TO TO DEAL WITH THIS BUT THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I THINK THAT. DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SOME DAY SOON. I I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE CALIFORNIA BAR -- LAWYERS ASSOCIATION RATHER OR THE OTHER -- ASPECT TO THIS WHERE THERE IS A REAL PUSH TO TRY TO GET ADDITIONAL SERVICES SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY COMING THROUGH THE BAR BUT THERE THERE ARE TWO OTHER ENTITIES I THINK ONE IS THE CHANGE. CHANGE GROUP CHANCELLOR'S CHANGE LAWYERS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR VERY ISSUE SO THERE IS DISCUSSION THERE IS EFFORT GOING FORWARD IN THAT. IN THAT SPACE TO TRY TO DO WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR PARK EVERYONE WHO NEEDS LEGAL SERVICES SO THAT THAT IS BEING ADDRESSED PERHAPS NOT. AS A SATISFACTORILY BUT THAT DISCUSSION IS CLEARLY TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE ACTUAL BAR IT'S ITS OWN SEPARATE ENTITY WITH THAT FOCUS BECAUSE WE'VE WE TOLD THE BAR WE WANT TO NARAL WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT. SO THAT'S AYE BUT THERE IS THAT CHANGE. LAWYERS THAT IS -- THE ENTITY THAT IS LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES VERY SPECIFICALLY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT [inaudible] SORRY -- BUT A POSITIVE STYLISH A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE GALLAGHER CHAU CHIU GONZALEZ [inaudible] HOLDEN KALRA [inaudible] KILEY. IN CHINA OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS REYES. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU. SO WE'VE. BUT ON A LONG JOURNEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE A LONG JOURNEY. I THINK WITH THE BAR AND A NUMBER OF ASPECTS. ARE CHANGING AT ALTHOUGH IT IS FRUSTRATING. DO RECOGNIZE A LOT OF CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED WITH THE BAR OF THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND YET THE AUDIT REPORT AND THE LA -- BOTH POINT OUT TO A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF PHYSICAL CONTROLS AT THE BAR. SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. THERE'S SUCH A DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT THE BAR ASKED FOR AND WHAT BOTH ALEJO AND THE AUDITOR'S SAID WERE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO INCREASE THE FEES. A LOT HAD TO DO WITH LACK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS IS ASTONISHING DIEM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE BAR RECENTLY ASKED FOR AND WHAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY ENDING UP WITH HERE WHICH I THINK UNDERSCORES AT THE BAR. NEED SOME WORK WITH RESPECT TO MANAGING ITS OWN FINANCES AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANNOUNCES. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO THE REAL ESTATE DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE. AND AS THOSE BARS TELLING US THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FIXING SOME OF THE THE LEASING REVENUES AND SOME OF THE THEY ASPECTS OF OF MANAGING THEIR PROPERTY AND AS THEY DO. THAT SHOULD RESULT IN. A REDUCTION IN FEES OR IN THE LEAST A MITIGATION OF HAVING TO INCREASE FEES AND IN THE FUTURE. SO THEIR NUMBER CATEGORIES THAT WE'VE BEEN TRACKING AND THAT I THINK WE NEED. TO TO TO HOLD ONTO. AS A COMMITTEE AND YES. THERE IS THIS A THOUGHT OF DOING THE BAR DUES BILL EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS I AM. PERSONALLY AND I'M NOW I'VE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF MEMBERS NOT READY FOR THAT BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE WE HAVE HAD AND I THINK THE BAR STILL NEEDS TO BUILD BACK SOME TRUST. AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FUNDING YOU APPROPRIATELY FOR THE MISSION WE HAVE SET YOU ON AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE THE BARS. HELPING FACILITATE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FACT WEEK ASK THIS OF THE LEGISLATURE. HAS PUT LEGAL SERVICES MONEY ON THE TABLE THROUGH THE JUDICIARY BUDGET EVERY YEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT GAPS AND LACK OF LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING COMING FROM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH A LOT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT RELIED ON IN THE PAST SO WE DO NEED TO BE LOOKING EVERYWHERE WE CAN FOR LEGAL SERVICES MONEY AND TO BE ABLE. TO TO GET PEOPLE THAT LEGAL HELP THAT THEY NEED ULTIMATELY. WITH RESPECT TO THE SCALE AND WE COULD DO THE SCALING BUT WE COULD DO WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE. AND I THINK THIS HOUSE THIS COMMITTEES PROBABLY READY FOR THAT. LEADERSHIP HAS INDICATED THAT THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THAT THE TIME THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD ON A TWO THIRDS VOTE BUT WE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE EFFECTIVELY. THOSE HIGHER PAID ATTORNEYS WOULD BE IN A WAY SUBSIDIZE THE LOWER PAID ATTORNEYS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BE A TWO THIRDS VOTE UNLESS WE CAN BE CLEVER ABOUT STRUCTURING IT SOME OTHER WAY WE HAVE. YET TO LOOK AT THAT AND AND MAKE AND THAT'S THAT'S BUILT INTO THIS IS THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING WORKING WITH THE BAR. TO SEE HOW WE CAN EFFECTIVELY SCALE IT IT IS FRUSTRATING TO PUT A PROGRESSIVE FEE IN PLACE REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE. AND WE'RE STUCK WITH WHAT IS IN FACT A VERY REGRESSIVE FEE AND A REGRESSIVE STRUCTURE THAT HURTS ATTORNEYS AT THE LOWEST AND WHERE WE DO NEED MORE HELP. THIS COMMITTEES ALSO BEEN WORKING ON ENSURING THAT WE GET MORE TOURNEY'S INTO THE PRACTICE WHICH WOULD. HELP WITH RAISING MORE FEES ARE MITIGATING. THE FEES BY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE DIVERSITY ACROSS THE THE BREADTH OF THE BAR AND THE BENCH AS WELL AS I THINK WE SHOULD. WE'RE LONG PAST TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT OPENING UP RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER STATES SO WE GET HIGH QUALITY ATTORNEYS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT LEAVES IT TO THE BAR TO DO THE ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. THE OTHER ASPECT THAT CAME OUT OF THE LA REPORT. DAILY -- REPORT IS. TO I WHAT THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES A SETTING UP THE PROCESS TO BRING THE BAR INTO OUR NORMAL BUDGETING PROCESS. WE HAVE A VIEW OF WHAT THE FEES ARE AND WE GET SOME SENSE OF WHAT THE HOW THAT THE BAR DOES SOME BUDGETING BUT IF THEY WERE PART OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS. THEN THE BUDGET EXPERTS WOULD HAVE INSIGHT INTO THE DECISIONS THAT GET MADE BY THE BAR ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER SENSE OF HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY THAT WE'RE ALLOWING THEM TO COLLECT AND AS A PUBLIC AGENCY I THINK THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE. THAT'S GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE BUDGET STAFF AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY'RE ABLE AND WILLING TO DO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SETTING UP IN THIS BILL I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT. IF WE HAVE THOSE MECHANISMS IN PLACE THEN IF WE DO A MULTI YEAR FEE STRUCTURE IF WE DO A LOT OF THE THE THINGS THAT THE BARS ASKING FOR THAT THE OTTER THE LA -- WE'RE STARTING TO RECOMMEND. I THINK WE'RE IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE THAN TO HAVE THE CONTROLS IN PLACE THE OVERSIGHT THAT IS OUR OBLIGATION OF PLACE AND OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE WHAT HOW THAT. PUBLIC AGENCIES BOTH DOING ITS JOB WITH RESPECT. TO PUBLIC PROTECTION BUT ALSO MANAGING ITS FINANCES SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HERE IN CENTER. YOU TAKE ANY AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH US AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THIS GOAL SAID IT'S BEEN QUITE A JOURNEY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. GETTING US TO THIS PLACE THEN AND STRUCTURING. THE STATE BAR. AS A A MODERN. ORGANIZATION THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION AND IS FULFILLING THAT OBLIGATION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION. TO THOSE KIND OF ISSUES THAT ARE POINTED OUT IN THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SO WE WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I KNOW A LOT OF YOU HAVE WAITED WITH ME OVER THE THE LAST WELL SEVERAL YEARS AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS THIS JOURNEY. AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. SENATOR YOU KNOW VERY BRIEFLY THE ONE COMPONENT THAT THAT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE THIS AFFECT THE STATE BAR'S UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT. I AND THAT THAT ABSOLUTE TWIST IN OUR DISCUSSIONS -- THE CORD TO I THINK IS VERY OF SUPPORTIVE FOR CERTAINLY HASN'T INDICATED A LACK OF SUPPORT FOR THE THE FOCUS ON THE COMMITMENT THE LEGISLATURE'S MAKING BUT I THINK WE DO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT GOING FOR WHEN WE ASK WHAT OTHER AGENCIES DO X. Y. IN SEE -- THEY'RE VERY FEW OTHER AGENCIES THAT AREIN FACT -- UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO AND SO. THIS MAKES IT ALL A LOT MORE INTERESTING -- AS WE TRY TO DO WHAT WE FEEL IS THE RIGHT THING IN THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE BAR. IN IN ITS. RESPONSIBILITIES TO SERVE THE PUBLIC SO WITH THAT -- I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THANK THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AGREE WITH EVERY PART OF IT. THE FOCUS HERE IS LET'S GET THAT BAR BACK ON TRACK -- I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO THE COST OF LIVING WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LAWYER FEES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS -- BACK THEN THIS IS A AN APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT OF THE NOTION THAT WE GOT SIXTEEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS BECAUSE WE'VE OPENED UP AND MADE THE PROCESS MORE TRANSPARENT. SAYS WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE COMPLAINTS -- AND TO WITH THAT I YEAH LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS VERY INTERESTING JOURNEY BUT AT THIS POINT TIME WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHAU. CHIU GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA.

AND SO I AM HERE TODAY -- TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE THAT -- HAS BEEN A FEDERAL. LAW WANT TO BRING IT TO THE STATE PARTICULARLY REFERENCING THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT. WOMEN ARE ABLE TO HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IN ACADEMICS AND ATHLETICS AND PURSUE AN EDUCATION IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SAFE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE. SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL THANK YOU -- AGAIN TITLE NINE THE FEDERAL CHECKS EQUITY IN EDUCATION LAW HAS BEEN VITAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS WOMEN MEN. GIRLS AND BOYS AT EVERY GRADE LEVEL. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IN ACADEMICS AND ATHLETICS. AGAIN PURSUING AN EDUCATION IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SAFE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION AND SPORTS SADLY THOUGH. AND SOMEONE SHOCKINGLY SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS PERVASIVE ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CAMPUS CLIMATE SURVEY VALIDATION STUDY. OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN ESTIMATED 62% OF WOMEN. AND 61% OF MEN. EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ONE IN FIVE WOMEN AND ONE IN FIVE EIGHT ONE IN FOURTEEN MEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN COLLEGE HOWEVER DUE TO THE UNDER REPORTING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IT'S LIKELY THE RATES. ARE MUCH HIGHER. CALIFORNIA HAS LOOKED TO AND RELIED UPON TITLE NINE FOR DECADES. BUT WE ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED BY THE DISMANTLING OF TITLE NINE'S PROTECTIONS BY A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS EXPRESSED OPEN HOSTILITY TO THE SAFEGUARDS TO PROVIDES. AND TO ADDRESSING GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IT HAS IN FACT ALREADY PROPOSED FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT GOT TITLE NINE'S CRITICAL PROTECTIONS. THIS MEASURE SB FOUR NINETY THREE CODIFIES ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOLS TO FOLLOW TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IS IN FOR THE IS EFFECTUATE. INCLUDING ADDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE EDUCATION CODE. SOMETHING THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT ISN'T THERE BUT THIS WILL ADDED IT DIRECTION ALL POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES AND REQUIREMENTS REGARDING SEXUAL PREVENTION. INCLUDING ADOPTING AND PUBLISHING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES AND PROVIDING FOR PROMPT. AND EQUITABLE RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINT AND IT REQUIRES AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION WHEN IT FINDS ITS SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS CREATED A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. TO ELIMINATE THAT HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT PREVENT ITS REOCCURRENCE AND ADDRESS ITS EFFECTS I WITH THAT THE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WANT TO MENTION THAT. WE HEAR IN OUR JUDICIARY COMMITTEES ARE COMMITTED TO DUE PROCESS THAT IS A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO THIS BILL -- I'M REMINDED THAT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY REALLY PURSUED THIS AREA AND ARE NOT EXPERTS IN -- IN THIS. THE PRECEDING PROCESS WE HELP -- PLACED IN SOME VERY SPECIFIC AND STRINGENT DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE EQUITY THRESHOLD THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING. AGAINST THIS BEHAVIOR ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND DOING SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT AND PROTECTIVE ABOUT IT WHEN IT DOES OCCUR. I AM JOINED TODAY BY JESSICA STANDARD WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES THE CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER AND I'M WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES WERE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF US BEFORE. NINE THREE FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS WE PRACTICE UNDER TIGHT ONLINE AND RELATED CALIFORNIA LAW AROUND CIVIL RIGHTS ANTI DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION EQUITY. WE'VE SEEN NUMEROUS WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEX HARASSMENT ASSAULT IN SCHOOL AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PROPER PROCEDURE RESPONSE FROM THEIR SCHOOLS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE TO EDUCATION. SEXUAL HARASSMENT INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE NOT ONLY CAUSES PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM BUT IMPEDES THE IMPACT OF A BILL IMPACTS ABILITY OF STUDENTS TO ACCESS THEIR EDUCATION AS REQUIRED UNDER LAW. AMPLE EVIDENCE SHOWS THE MAJORITY OF VICTIMS COME OUR WOMEN OR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER DISENFRANCHISED GROUPS. EXISTING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION AND REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO TAKE PRACTICE TAKES STEPS TO RESPOND TO SEXUAL HUSBAND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AS YOU HEARD FROM SENATOR JACKSON THERE'S INSUFFICIENT GUIDANCE IN THE LAW FOR HOUSE SCHOOL SHOULD RESPOND TO THESE INCIDENTS AND WE'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE HARM THAT THAT CAN CAUSE TO THE STUDENTS. THIS BILL IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT DELINEATES TRANSPARENT EQUITABLE PROCESS SEES THAT SCHOOLS MUST FOLLOW TO ENSURE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE PROCESS FOR ALL PARTIES BY REQUIRING IMPART. TRAINING FOR SCHOOL OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN SCHOOL MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AN IMPARTIAL HEARING WERE BOTH PARTIES ARE GIVEN THE CHANCE RESENT EVIDENCE WITNESSES AND ALLOW AN INDEPENDENT FACT FINDER TO FIND FACTS AND MAKE CREDIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. IN THIS PROCESS I PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE RIGHT TO ATTEND -- ALIVE HEARING -- CONDUCTED BY AN IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATOR -- WHO WHO PRESENT QUESTIONS TO BOTH SIDES THAT HERE THE PARTY ONCE AND FINALLY I KNOW THAT THE BILL PROVISIONS ARE IN LINE WITH? FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN'S -- TASK FORCE REPORT THAT HE CONVENED -- TO TO WORK TOO BRIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE. SB FOUR NINE THREE OUTLINES PROCESS HE'S FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO RESPOND TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGED HARASSMENT ASSAULT THROUGH A NEUTRAL PROCESS THAT IS FAIR TO BOTH COMPLAIN AND RESPONDED. IN THIS BAY THE BILL AND THE WAY THE BILL ENSURE THAT CIVIL RIGHTS -- SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF ALL STUDENTS ARE MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA AND FOR THAT REASON WE RESPECTFULLY REST REQUEST RIVAL.

MY NAME IS CYNTHIA GARRETT I'M A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY AND PROFIT. THAT SEEKS -- DUE PROCESS AND FAIR PROCEDURES IN TITLE NINE PROCEEDINGS. I'M GOING TO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY HERE TODAY ANY PARENTS WHO NORMALLY SPEAK WITH US. I'M GOING TO JUST READ SOME OF THEIR COMMENTS THAT THEY'VE SENT TO ME. MY SON'S PHYSICIAN ASKED HIM HOW OFTEN HE THINKS OF KILLING HIMSELF MY SON REPLIED NEARLY EVERY DAY. DURING THE CAR RIDE HOME MY SON TOLD ME HE FELT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN RIPPED FROM HIM ALL HIS HOPES AND DREAMS WERE SHATTERED THE MOMENT HIS COLLEGE EXPELLED HIM FOR A SEXUAL ASSAULT HE DID NOT COMMIT. WHILE IT WAS CLEAR IN THE END THAT SHE COMPLETELY FABRICATED HER CLAIMS OF MY SON WAS LEFT SUICIDAL WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. TO EXTENSIVE HOSPITALIZATIONS THREE LOS SEMESTERS AT SCHOOL NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS AN OUT OF POCKET LOSSES AND A COMPLETE LOSS OF HIS HOPES. DREAMS AND POSSIBILITIES A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE. AS A PARENT WHO LIVE THIS PROCESS I SAW MY INNOCENCE SON LOSE EVERYTHING HAS HOPES DREAMS ANY TRUST. WE PICKED HIM UP OFF THE CAMPUS LAWN AND A CRUMBLE IN VOMITING AFTER MEETING WITH THE D.. I DIDN'T SLEEP FOR MONTHS WORRIED HE TAKE HIS OWN LIFE PULLING HIM FROM THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR. THIS IS REALITY IT'S REAL AND IN OUR CASE THERE WAS NO SEX HE SAID NO WHEN A GIRL CAME ON TO HIM. THE NIGHTMARE OF THE CAMPUS PROCESS ROCKED OUR FAMILIES BROUGHT US TO OUR KNEES I PRAY FOR THE DAY I COULD TELL MY STORY TO SENATORS. IN HEARING ONLY THEN WILL I FEEL HER. I REMEMBER THE PAIN I REMEMBER CRYING WHEN I BACK TO VACUUM THE LIVING I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN MOURNING THE LOSS OF MY SON'S DREAMS. I DIDN'T SLEEP BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED I'D FIND HIM DEAD IN THE MORNING WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM WAS A NIGHTMARE AND IT AFFECTED OUR ENTIRE FAMILY. IT STILL HURTS I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T KEEP MY CHILDREN SAFE. WHAT I REMEMBER MOST IS A SMILE THE PRIDE BEAMING FROM HIS FACE THAT FIRST DAY AT HIS DREAM COLLEGE HE HAD WORKED SO HARD TO GET THERE WHAT COMES FROM TITLE? NINE SUICIDE WATCH ANXIETY DEPRESSION PTSD WHO CAN YOU TRUST. TRYING TO PICK HIMSELF UP FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIVE AGAIN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAVE BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. HIS LIFE MATTERS OR IT SHOULD. ACCUSED OR TREATED AS WE ALL KNOW VERY DIFFERENTLY IN THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND ACCUSED ACTING DEFENSIVE IS ATTITUDE MY SON'S ADJUDICATOR BULLY CAM AND USED INTIMIDATION TACTICS HE CAME OVER STOOD WAY TOO CLOSE HOVERING OVER HIM AND AGGRESSIVELY QUESTIONING HIM. ABOUT EVERYTHING A Q. STUDENTS ARE NOT SUBJECTED ACCUSING STUDENTS ARE NOT SUBJECTED THAT TREATMENT. THIS WAS A SCHOOL HE LOVED AND BELIEVED WOULD BE FAIR HE WAS TREATED LIKE A CRIMINAL. THE ADMINISTRATOR TOLD HIM THAT A FEMALE STUDENT CAN CHANGE HER MIND ABOUT WHETHER SHE REALLY MEANT TO HAVE SEX MONTHS LATER REGARDLESS OF HEALTH THINGS HAD APPEARED AT THE TIME. I ALMOST FELL OUT OF MY CHAIR. THIS ADMINITRATOR RECOMMENDED OUR SON BE EXPELLED BASED SOLELY ON THE ACCUSER'S VERSION OF EVENTS DID NO INVESTIGATION COLLECTED NO EVIDENCE. OUR SON APPEALED AND HIRED AN ATTORNEY AND WAS THAT EVENTUALLY FOUND NOT RESPONSIBLE. EVEN SO LONG TERM HIS PSYCHE SPIRIT AND REPUTATION HAVE BEEN DAMAGED WE PRAY TIME WILL HEAL. THE ACCUSER HAD NO REPLICA QUESTIONS FOR MAKING A FALSE CLAIM MA'AM I NEED TO WRAP UP PLEASE SEND THEM [inaudible] EVERYONE MARK. SOMETHING ROB PLEASE SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE WE TOLD ME TO GO HOME I PACKED UP MY WORK HEADED OUT THE DOOR AS I DROVE I FELT PANIC WELL UP INSIDE OF ME. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG I TRIED TO TALK MYSELF OUT OF IT ONCE WENT HOME I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE GARAGE OPENING THE DOOR GAZING UP. I SEE FINGERS FUMBLING AROUND A ROPE WHAT KIND OF ROPE FORTY GET THAT I GLANCE DOWN TENNIS SHOES TEETERING ON A LARGE BUCKET. MY FACE MEETS HIS TEAM TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE HE HAS BROKEN HIS LOSS I START TO SHAKE MY VOICE CRACKS THROUGH MY TEARS. HONEY THIS ISN'T THE WAY STOP TO HELP HIM DOWN TAKE THE ROPE FROM HIS NECK HOLDING TIGHT. I WON'T LET GO I WILL FIGHT FOR ALL OF US AND THAT STUDENT ALSO WAS FOUND NOT RESPONSIBLE EVENTUALLY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S MARK HALF WAY I'M AN ATTORNEY -- IN LOS ANGELES AND I HEAR THIS MORNING THAT MY PARTIES ARE GOING UP. THANK HEAVEN FOR TWENTY YEARS WELL I THEN THEN THAT COVERS MOST HERE HAVE LIMITED TIME YOU CAN SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT YOU CAN SPEAK ON ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT IN MY POWER DIRT STAY RIGHT. PLEASE -- MY PARTNERED JENNA PARKER AND I'VE REPRESENTED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE INCLUDING SOME FORTY COURT CASES AGAINST PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES THE CASCADE SYSTEM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. INCLUDING THE RECENT DECISION OR JANUARY OF DOUGH FOR SICILY WHICH IS CHANGE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE. OF HOW THESE CASES IS SUPPOSED TO BE DETERMINED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AND ELSEWHERE. THAT HELP TO FIND THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM WAS LACKING IN TWO FOUR PROCESS IN FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. I ALSO AM THE FATHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS TWO OF WHOM ARE STILL IN COLLEGE THE BENEFITTED FROM TITLE NINE AND WE'RE STUDENT ATHLETES. AND I'M CERTAINLY STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF EVERY EFFORT THAT CAN BE DONE TO ADDRESS SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES BUT HE CAN'T COME AT THE COST. OF DUE PROCESS AND FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS. AND AND PROCEDURES AND RIGHTS THAT ARE FAMILIAR TO ALL OF US IN GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND HAVE BEEN HARD -- WON RECENT COURT CASES HAVE SHOWN THE CROSS EXAMINATION IS IS UTTERLY VITAL BEFORE NEUTRAL FACT FINDERS IN ORDER TO REACH THE TRUTH AND A FAIR DEFENSE. THIS BILL GOT EIGHTY EFFORT. ANY ABILITY FOR AN ACTUAL CROSS EXAMINATION THE BACK AND FORTH QUESTION AND ANSWER THE DEBATE THAT'S GOING ON NOW. IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAPPEN AT THE HEARING LEVEL IF YOU TAKE OUT SUBSECTION TWO THEN THE BILL FIND IT ALLOWS FOR CROSS EXAMINATION. AND ALLOWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF OF VICTIMS BY APPEARING. IN A BY VIDEO CONFERENCE -- FOR ELSE. OR SOME OTHER MEANS THAT PROTECTS THEM TRAUMA INFORMED AS A PROBLEM ONLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT DEFINED IN THE LAW. TRUST NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO VICTIMS BEING TREATED WITH RESPECT. AND WITH -- WITH CARE AND GREAT COMPASSION. BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE AN IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATOR START OUT BY BELIEVING THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY WHICH IS OFTEN WHAT TRAUMA INFORMED TO MEANS. THE INVESTIGATOR HAS TO START OUT BY BELIEVING THE VICTIM THERE. FOR THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS NOW ON THE ON THE ACCUSED TO PROVE THEMSELVES INNOCENT. THAT SHIFTS THE BURDEN OF PROOF WHICH ALSO IS NOT MENTIONED IN THIS IN THIS BILL AND IT ALSO DOES NOT MENTION THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE FOR THE ACCUSED. SO IT IMPROPERLY TRANSFERS THOSE -- BURDENS TO AN ACCUSED AND ACCUSER NOT SIMPLY MALE STUDENTS I THINK OF A DRIVE BUT I I CITED SEVERAL EXAMPLES -- I'VE GOT MANY OTHER CASES THAT INVOLVE -- EITHER SAME SEX OR A FEMALE -- PERPETRATOR AND IT'S WHOEVER GETS TO THE TITLE NINE OFFICE FIRST IS THE ONE THAT WINS BECAUSE OF THE PRESUMPTIONS. AND IF THERE'S NO PROTECTIONS FOR THE ACCUSED THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU'RE ACCUSED YOU LOSE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY COURT CASES HAVE GONE AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THIRTY AND IT ROUTES STATE SYSTEM -- I WOULD URGE THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED FURTHER I HAVEN'T SEEN THE NEW AMENDMENTS PERHAPS MY POSITION WOULD CHANGE. BUT I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE OF DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HEARINGS. WITH BOTH VICTIMS AND PERPETRATORS IN CAMPUS HEARINGS AND ALSO DEALING WITH IT IN COURT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED BUT THIS BILL DOES NOT TO IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT'S WITH US PLEASE I UP MY NAME A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS STEPHEN SO OVER I'M AN ATTORNEY IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY'S OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL -- WE SUPPORT STRONGLY THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL IN THE VAST MAJORITY WITH PROVISIONS HOWEVER IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED OUR POSITION IS OPPOSED LESS AMENDED -- THE CSU STRONGLY EMBRACES THE IDEA AT THE HEART OF AS BEFORE NINETY THREE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION FREE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THAT UNIVERSITIES HAVE A VITAL ROLE IN KEEPING THEIR STUDENTS SAFE. BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE BILL AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED I KNOW OUR TIME IS LIMITED SO I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON ONE OUR BIGGEST CONCERN THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN PROFITS TO THE BILL AND CENTER JACKSON POINTED OUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE REMAINS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. ON CAMPUSES BUT WHAT DOESN'T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION IS THE WORK OF CAMPUS TITLE NINE COORDINATORS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE INVOLVED IN RESPONDING TO INVESTIGATING AND REMEDIATING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. AND WHO ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING A FAIR PROCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION BUT HAVING MET THE TITLE NINE TEAMS AT OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES -- WHICH WERE CREATED WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL FUNDING VIRTUALLY FROM SCRATCH OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE ARE CONSCIENTIOUS PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THE LAW AND THE POLICIES IMPLEMENTING IT. WHEN THEY GO TO WORK THEY KNOW THERE'S A CHANCE THAT DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS IT WILL BE PART OF A LAWSUIT FILED BY AN ATTORNEY FOR A COMPLAINANT FOR RESPONDENT WERE BOTH? THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STUDENTS. IT IS A FACT OF LIFE OF COURSE IN TITLE NINE PROVIDES A RIGHT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AS TO THE CALIFORNIA EQUITY AND HIGHER EDUCATION ACT. BOTH OF THESE STATUTES EVER FOCUS ON FUNDAMENTALS PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AND ENSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION. BY CONTRAST SB FOUR NINETY THREES PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. ENSURES THAT IT IS MORE ANALOGOUS TO A SET OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS TO TIE IN A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO A BILL OF SUCH BREATH -- NO OFFENSE MISTER HATHAWAY -- I SHOULD ADD THAT LITIGATION IS COSTLY ON THE STUDENTS. FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY AND FAVORS THOSE WITH GREATER RESOURCES. OUT ONE LAST POINT IF I COULD -- THE MOST RECENT MOCK UP OF THE BILL PROPOSES THAT LITIGANTS BE REQUIRED TO SHOW INJURY WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS IN THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THE CHANGES RESPECTFULLY DO NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE SECTION -- SIX SIX TO EIGHT ONE POINT EIGHT B. THREE L. LITTLE AYE AYE STATES AT UNIVERSITY SHALL QUOTE CREATE REASONABLE PROCEDURES FOR THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS INCLUDING. ELLIPSIS REASONABLE AND EQUITABLE EVIDENTIARY GUIDELINES DEADLINES AND PAGE OR WORD LIMITATIONS QUOTE. BUT WHAT EVIDENTIARY RULES DEADLINES AND WERE LIMITATIONS ARE QUOTE REASONABLE. IT IS SUBJECTIVE AND A PARTY WHO EXPERIENCES AN UNFAVORABLE RESULT COULD EASILY CLAIM THAT IT RESULTED FROM THOSE QUOTE UNFAIR RULES. TO PREVENT THIS RESULT WE HAVE PROPOSED AT THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHEN AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IS VIOLATED THE LAW. UNLESS SUCH A CHANGE IS MADE WE RESPECTFULLY TAKING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. Q.. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE MY NAME IS LINDA WHO SIGNED THE CSU SYSTEM WIDE TITLE NINE COORDINATOR -- AND WE ARE TAKING OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED STANCE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ALEX GRAVES OF THE ICC WE REPRESENT A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE MUST AMENDED POSITION THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK AROUND SOME OTHER ISSUES OUTLINED BY CSU WE ARE CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SUZANNE TAYLOR AND THE SYSTEM I. TIMELINE DIRECTOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ALSO TAKING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR REASONS SIMILAR TO ON THOSE OUTLINED A CSU. WE ARE ON THE RECORD WITH OUR POSITION THANK YOU. MY NAME'S AMANDA I'M WITH CALIFORNIA MOM'S EMPOWERING MEN AND BOYS AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. JOHN ACCUSED STATE FALSELY KEYS STUDENT PARENT STRONGLY OPPOSED. NICHOLS HALFWAY STUDENT OPPOSE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE STRESS. TO THE WITNESS I EIGHT I OFFER MY CONDOLENCES TO THE MOTHER WHOSE SON WAS FALSELY ACCUSED AND HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT -- AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALSO MANY WOMEN WHO SUFFERS THROUGH THIS. AND DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE THROUGH THE PROCESS EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING ALTHOUGH THEY ARE THE WITH THE WITH THE VICTIM THEY ARE PUT ON THE STAND AS IF THEY WERE -- THEY WERE GUILTY. SO IT IT'S AN IMPERFECT PROCESS I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE TO THE SENATORS EFFORTS. IN THIS SHE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO ADDRESS. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES -- THAT AFFECT SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS -- BUT I DID WANT TO COMMENT REGARDING THE STUDENT THE CHIP THE CHIU REFER. TO THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THIS GALLAGHER. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR AND I YOU KNOW I I STRUGGLE. WITH THIS BILL. AS I DID WITH YOUR PREVIOUS LEGISLATION -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WHICH IS. FOR FAR TOO LONG -- VICTIMS HAVEN'T FELT COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD. BECAUSE OF THE BURDENSOME. SAYS BECAUSE OF STIGMA AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ARE PRESENT -- ONCOLOGY CAN'T BUT NOT JUST ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS RIGHT -- THE YOU KNOW THE PUBLICITY AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH THAT THE PRESSURES -- AND SO I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THE MOTIVATION OBVIOUSLY BEHIND WANTING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS DO FEEL COMFORTABLE. COMING FORWARD -- IN THIS CASE ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. BUT AB AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON ONE WE STILL DON'T REALLY HAVE. CLEAR DIRECTION ON TITLE NINE REGULATIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO THAT'S STILL A SHIFTING LANDSCAPE AS IT IS. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW WHAT ARE THOSE FINAL REGULATIONS BEFORE. MAY WE DELVE INTO THIS SPACE. AND ARE THEY GONNA BE LOOPHOLES CREATED BY US CREATING SOME SORT OF STANDARD. AND OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE THEY GONNA HAVE TO BE FORCED TO WHAT STANDARD THEY COMPLY WITH -- OR DO THEY GET SUED. FOR FOLLOWING ONE STANDARD BUT NOT FALL IN THE OTHER -- AND THEN I THINK MAYBE MORE FUNDAMENTALLY IN AND FOR US IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DUE PROCESS. BECAUSE ON THE RESPONDENTS SIDE. THESE ARE. JUST AS THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY -- FOR THE VICTIMS IT ALSO HAS TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY THAT WE PROVIDE FULL DUE PROCESS FOR THE PERSON THAT'S BEING ACCUSED AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT UNDER THESE RULES. YOU KNOW WE'RE CHANGING THE STANDARD OF EVIDENCE. WERE CHANGING IN THE ABILITY TO GET AN APPEAL. AND MAYBE MORE FUNDAMENTALLY WERE TAKEN AWAY THE RIGHT TO DIRECTLY CROSS EXAMINE. WITNESSES -- AND THE VICTIM AS MUCH AS I KNOW THAT HAVING TO TESTIFY AND BE CROSS EXAMINED. I COULD IMAGINE HAVING TO BE IN THAT SITUATION RIGHT. BUT NONE THE LESS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL. YOU KNOW PRINCIPLES -- IN THIS COUNTRY AND UNDER OUR RULE OF LAW. IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF CRIME YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONFRONT THOSE WHO ARE WITNESSES AGAINST YOU -- IN THAT YOU HAVE THOSE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IN PLACE -- TO HELP INSURE THAT THERE IS A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND THAT YOU'RE. INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN. GUILTY -- AND SO THAT I THINK THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS. IS OVER YOU KNOW HOW WE ENSURING. THAT WE HAVE THAT DO PRESS RECOGNIZES IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING I RECOGNIZE THAT HOWEVER. YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT -- WE ALL LOVE THE ABILITY TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION AND HOW WE WANT PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THIS. STATE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. SO THE TAKING OF THAT AWAY IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT'S VERY SERIOUS AND NOT TO MENTION. IF YOU ARE FOUND GUILTY BY THIS BODY. ALL OF EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH THAT RIGHT -- AND IF YOU WERE TRULY INNOCENT AND FELT LIKE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE FULL OPPORTUNITY. TO PUT ON YOUR CASE TO PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE -- THAT'S SIGNIFICAN I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE GOVERNOR WAS GOVERNOR BROWN -- WHEN HE VETOED LEGISLATION LAST YEAR? IS THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH TO REALLY ENSURE THAT DUE PROCESS PROTECTION. IS IS PART OF THIS. WHILE ALSO TAKING CARE OF THE THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATION WHICH IS A VICTIMS. HAVE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FOR BUT THEIR CLAIM SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE CHARITIES -- CERTAINLY AND THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT TO PROCESS. AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE NOT COURTS OF LAW. OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN WOEFULLY LACKING WHEN IT COMES TO THE TO THE PROTECTIONS OF TITLE NINE AND SO AT IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS -- THIS HAS BECOME A FOCAL POINT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- AFTER TWO YEARS OF ROBUST RESEARCH CAME OUT WITH A WHAT THEY CALL THE DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER. WHICH WAS A DESIGNED TO GIVE THE PARAMETERS TO CREATE THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT DUE PROCESS WAS TO BE AND HOW TITLE NINE WAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IT WAS A GUN WITH WHAT WAS THAT ME BECAUSE I STILL AM AND CONFUSED BY THE DEAR COLLEAGUES IS THAT ACTUALLY A REGULATION. IT WAS IT SEEMED LIKE A REALLY HALF MEASURE FROM YOU KNOW IT WAS A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT TO THE UNIVERSITIES AND IT WAS DESIGNED TO CREATE A DUE PROCESS -- CONSTRUCT. OSAP BUT EXCUSE ME YOU'RE NOT. THANK YOU. I IT WAS A IT WAS A GUIDANCE IT WAS A DOCUMENT TO GUIDE OUR UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW UP UNTIL. OF WELL EVEN EXISTING NOW THERE'S REALLY BEEN NO DIRECTION AS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT SO THIS WAS A DOCUMENT. TO GUIDE UNIVERSITIES WHAT HAPPENED IS DURING THE RAID DURING THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. MR TRUMP. HAS PULLED THIS BACK HIS CURRENT SECRETARY OF EDUCATION IS MADE IT CLEAR THAT SHE THINKS MOST OF THESE CLAIMS ARE FALSE. AND HAS INDICATED HER INTENTION TO PULL THE PLUG IF YOU WILL ON THIS GUIDANCE PROCESS AND CREATE HER OWN VERSION OF WHAT DUE PROCESS SHOULD BE. SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR VETOED THIS BILL HE SAID YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO CREATING A SYSTEM THAT WILL PROVIDE THIS TO PROCESS. THAT'S WHAT HE DID AND MOST OF THE BILL THAT YOU SEE HERE TODAY IS BASEDUPON THE DIRECTIVES THAT WERE GIVEN BY THE GOVERNOR'S THREE PERSON PANEL OF EXPERTS ALL EXTRAORDINARILY. QUALIFIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THAT WE'VE INCORPORATED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TITLE -- NINE REDEFINITION DAD IS BEEN PROPOSED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT I BELIEVE THE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA IS AND SHOULD BE. DEALING WITH A TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN YOU YOU MENTIONED IT YOURSELF. THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL IT IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT. ONE AND I AS A SOMEONE WHO PRACTICED LAW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS APPRECIATE AND I'M COMMITTED TO THE CONCEPT OF FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS. IT REQUIRES THAT WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT WE HAVE IMPARTIAL HEARINGS WE HAVE. AN INDEPENDENT FACT FINDER WHO MAKES A DETERMINATION BASED UPON ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED BY BOTH SIDES. NOW SOME OF THE STORIES THAT HAPPENED  FEW YEARS AGO WERE THAT BECAUSE UNIVERSITIES DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN PLACE THEY WOULD JUST ASSUME WELL SOMEONE'S MADE A CLAIM AND YOU'RE OUT OF SCHOOL -- AND THAT ISN'T THE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING HERE THE SYSTEM WE'RE DEVELOPING HERE IS THAT THEIR ALLEGATIONS MADE THAT WHEN A VICTIM COMES FORWARD SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES OR HAS BEEN. A SEXUALLY. ASSAULTED OR RAPED THAT THEY ARE GIVEN THE KIND OF CARE THAT WE KNOW VICTIMS HAVE NOW WE DIDN'T BRING. TODAY TO TESTIFY SOME OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WHO STORIES WOULD TEAR AT YOUR HEART STRINGS TO AND THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES. WHO LEAVE COLLEGE? THEY LEAVE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DISTRAUGHT AT HAVING TO CONFRONT THERE ARE THERE THE RAPIST THEIR ABUSER. SO THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE NOW I MEAN WE'RE TRYING TO DO THINGS TO STOP THIS WE'VE GOT YES MEANS YES ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES SO THAT WE'RE TEACHING ABOUT. INFORMED CONSENT TRYING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF RAPE ON CAMPUS BUT IN THE MEAN TIME WHEN WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS. THERE WERE IS NOW A PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE IS DONEI THINK A VERY SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED JOB DEALING WITH THIS TO PROVIDE THAT TO PROCESS. LET ME JUST THROW OUT THE NOTION THAT. PLAGIARISM IS ENDED IT IS AN OFFENCE ON COLLEGE THAT CAN GET YOU BOOTED OUT. BUT WE AND WE HAVE IN PLACE CERTAIN SYSTEMS FOR THAT WHICH AREN'T ANYWHERE NEAR AS PROTECTIVE AS WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT THAT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING. THAT'S A PROCEEDING WHERE SOMEONE CAN BE -- FORCED OUT OF THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING WHERE YOU HAVE PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT'S IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GO TO A COURT. AND MOST OF THESE VICTIMS IRONICALLY DO NOT. THEY TRUST WANT TO BE FREE OF THEIR ACCUSER THEY WANT TO BE VINDICATED FROM THIS MOST OF THESE FOLKS DON'T NECESSARILY EVEN WANT THEM TO BE THROWN OUT OF SCHOOL. BUT THERE BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS GET A HANDLE ON WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF THE VICTIM WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE AND HOW WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT IS FAIR TO EVERYONE. THE ACCUSED AND THE ACCUSERS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE A WORKING ON CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HAD HERE TODAY WE'VE GOT AMENDMENTS THAT -- EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES HAS BEEN WORKING ON WITH MY A STAFF -- THAT WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES TO GET TO THAT SWEET SPOT I THINK WE ARE. VERY CLOSE IF NOT THERE I THINK NOW WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT BUT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE FOR THOSE WHO ARE WHO. CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES IN WITH THAT STUFF. I HOPE THAT THAT RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION NOW IS IS VERY SPONSORED BUT JUST REALLY QUICKLY TO TO SUMMARIZE I HEAR YOU SAYING. I FULLY SUPPORT MAKING THIS PROTECTING DUE PROCESS IN THESE CDNS SO. I THINK A LOT OF THESE CASES ARE GONNA INVOLVE PRIMARILY WITNESS TESTIMONY. FROM THE VICTIM AND THE RESPONDENT -- AND THEN ANY WITNESSES THAT CAN TESTIFIED OTHER THING SO HAVING IN PLACE THE ABILITY TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES. WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE A PRETTY IMPORTANT WELL WELL TO HAVE A SYSTEM -- AND ALL THAT -- IT'S UNDER THE VETERAN LANGUAGE AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU. DON'T ALLOW FOR DIRECT CROSS EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH I CAN RESPOND TO THAT -- THE THE BILL PROVIDES -- FOR LIVE CROSS EXAMINATION AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE CASE THAT MR GALLAGHER MENTIONED -- SO THE BILL ALLOWS THE NEUTRAL JUDICATA DECISION MAKER TO PRESENT QUESTIONS TO BOTH PARTIES -- THAT THE OTHER PARTY REQUESTS AND THAT CAN BE DONE IN A LIVE SETTING IT'S NOT DIRECT WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED BY ALL THE OTHERS THE REASON FOR THAT PROVISION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CASE LAW AND WITH GOVERNOR BROWN SOUTH FORCE. IS THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT -- SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN SEVERELY ABUSE WHEN THEY ARE BEING QUESTIONED DIRECTLY BY EITHER THE PERSON WHO IS THEY ARE ACCUSING OF RAPING THEM OR THAT PERSON'S ADVISER OR OR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE. A SERVICE PROVIDES THE OF RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS THE PERSON MAKING THE ALLEGATION ABOUT WHATEVER THEY WANT TO ASK ABOUT ANOTHER ARBITRATOR THROUGH QUESTIONS IMAGES THE NEUTRAL -- INVESTIGATOR HA. AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH CASE THE CASE LAW THAT. ON TO THAT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN A CASE IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS WHERE SOMEONE HAS BEEN DIRECTLY CROSS EXAMINED. IN A AND A SETTING OTHER THAN STAND WILL STAND FOR DOESN'T EVEN HAVE IT -- SO THERE IS THERE IT REQUIRES DIRECT CROSS EXAMINATION THIS BILL REFERS TO LIVE CROSS EXAMINATION BUT IT'S NOT LIFE IT COULDN'T BE BETTER IT'S HAVING TO WRITE DOWN A QUESTION HAVING IT SUBMITTED TO ANOTHER PERSON WHO CAN RULE ON IT SUBMITTED TO THE WITNESS. WHO CAN ALSO DECIDE NOT TO ANSWER IT NOT ONLY NOT DECIDE NOT TO ENTRANCE AT REFUSED TO ANSWER BUT OBJECT TO IT ON SOME TYPE OF GROUNDS? IT IS NOT THE TYPE OF BACK AND FORTH IS IF HIS KERING HERE WHERE IDEAS ARE EXPRESSED IN THE IN THE TRUTH COULD COME OUT IT'S THE REACTION TO SOMEBODY'S QUESTION WHY IS IT THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR TESTIMONY. HOW COME YOU TOLD THIS PERSON THAT AND THEY TOLD THIS PERSON SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND IT'S THAT INFORMATION THAT CAN ONLY COME OUT THROUGH LIFE? BACK AND FORTH DIALOGUE ANY CAN BE DONE BY VIDEO BUT I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION QUICKLY THE PLAGIARISM ISSUE. AND I DOUBT ARE GONNA THAT YEAH THANK. YOU AND IF I GO TO INDICATE UNDER THE DOE CASE WHICH WAS REFERRED. TO SETS FORTH THE ROAD THE REQUIREMENT OF EXAMINATION THAT THAT IS IN THIS BILL. SO WE'RE FOLLOWING THE CASE LAW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AGAIN THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING AND FOLLOWING THE REQUIREMENTS OF DOUGH THE ACCUSED MAY CROSS EXAMINE. THOSE WITNESSES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AT A HEARING WHICH THE IT WITNESSES APPEAR IN PERSON OR BY OTHER MEANS VIDEO CONFERENCING. BEFORE A NEUTRAL ADJUDICATOR WITH THE POWER INDEPENDENTLY TO FIND FACTS TO MAKE CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENTS THAT'S THE LAW. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL FALLS. RIGHT BUT IF IF IF YOU CAN'T ASK THE QUESTION. YEAH BECAUSE IT SAYS AT THE HEARING IN WHICH THE WITNESSES APPEAR IN PERSON UNDER DUB VERSES ALI AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT DOUGH. MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A CIVIL PROCEEDING. THIS HAS LIKE SEMI CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS AND AND THE AND THE READ AND THE WHOLE REASONING. BEHIND DOES IT MAYBE YOU DO IS ESSENTIALLY THAT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER STANDARD. TO PROTECT DUE PROCESS RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE THAT'S WHY WE PUT THOSE STANDARDS IN THERE I DON'T KNOW AND IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND I DO. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THE QUESTION TO THE ARBITRATOR -- NOT ARBITRATOR BUT THE ADJUDICATOR. THEY WOULD RULE ON WHETHER NOT THAT QUESTION IS ALLOWED TO BE ASKED WHICH THAT WOULD NEVER BE THE CASE IN A CROSS EXAM NORMALLY. WELL IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN OBJECT TO A QUESTION IF YOU COULD NOW THAT THE LORD OUR GOD JIM THE JUDGE CAN SAY YOUR OBJECTION IS SUSTAINEDBUT NOT SEPARATELY FROM. WHERE THE LIVE WITNESSES BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DO YOU UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU WOULD ASK THE QUESTION? AND SOMEONE COULD OBJECT THE OF THE ATTORNEY COULD OBJECT TO THE QUESTION -- AND IF THE OBJECTION AS OF HELD IN THE QUESTIONS WITHDRAWN RIGHT BUT ASSUMING THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTION THEN IT'S NOT UP TO THE THE ADJUDICATOR TO ANSWER ASK THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE QUESTION IS PROPER OR NOT. THE PERSON GETS TO ASK THE QUESTION HAVE A RESPONSE WEATHER COULD BE BY VIDEO. CONFERENCE SEEN. AT THE HEARING RIGHT AND WHAT I'M HEARING HERE IS THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE YOU HAVE TO GIVE THESE QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE. TO THE ADJUDICATOR WHICH MAKES IT TO ME SOUND LIKE IT'S NOT. THE SAME TYPE OF PROCEEDING DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. WELL AGAIN IT'S A PROCEEDING THAT TRIES TO RECOGNIZE THE FREQUENTLY A VICTIM IS BADGERED BY A GOOD DEFENSE ATTORNEY. AND THAT THIS IT HAS. LEAD TO VICTIMS BEING UNWILLING TO STEP FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S A FURTHER. HARASSMENT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND HERE IS AN APPROPRIATE HAPPY MEDIUM SO THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED. CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO STEP FORWARD WITHOUT SUFFERING A YET AGAIN THE HARASSMENT THE THE ASSAULT. THAT TOOK A GOOD CROSS EXAMINER GOOD DEFENSE ATTORNEY -- IS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO PROPOSE AND THAT IT YOU KNOW IF THEY GO TO A CRIMINAL COURT. THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF BUT THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS FOLLOW THE DIRECTIVES -- I GUESS YOU COULD ARGUE WITH THAT UP THE YOU THE KAZOO BUT WE HAVE TAKEN THE PROPOSED A OF PROOF OF PROVISIONS OF DOLE VERSUS ALLEY WHICH WAS MENTIONED BY. THIS GENTLEMAN HERE AND WE'VE INCORPORATED THEM INTO THIS BILL BUT THERE HAS TO BE AGAIN THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT ARBITER WHO PROBABLY CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THAT THAT QUESTION. IS TOO PROVOCATIVE IS TO COME -- INTIMIDATING. OF FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE TO ANSWER I MEAN. L. AS A AS A PROSECUTOR I WAS IN COURT WHEN A DEFENSE ATTORNEY WAS ASKING A RAPE VICTIM HOW DID SHE KNOW SHE WAS RAPED -- AND AND ATTEMPT TO RELIVE THAT EXPERIENCE. IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING AND THAT'S IN A CRIMINAL CASE THESE THESE ARE NOT CRIMINAL CASES WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR ADJUDICATOR WHO IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. BY THE FAX BY THE QUESTIONING BY THE DEMEANOR OF THE WITNESSES THE VALIDITY OF THE CLAIM OR NOT FOR PURPOSES OF SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WHETHER IT'S FORCING SOMEONE OUGHT TO SCHOOL FOR A SEMESTER FORCING THEY MOVING INTO ANOTHER DORM. WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS IT IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE THESE ARE NOT CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIFE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS. I THINK I WOULD IS JUST AND BY SAYING AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I THINK THAT. WE SHOULD TRY TO PUT SOME MORE WORK INTO ENSURING. THAT DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS THERE AND I I THINK WE ALL AGREE LIKE I CERTAINLY WANT TO CREATE. AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE WILLING TO COME FORWARD. WITH THEIR CLAIMS AND AND WE CAN BACK ON DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WE ALL HAVE I THINK WE CAN ALL DO. TO OF A JUDGE WHO WAS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHEN YOUR LONG TIME WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF A SERIOUS CRIME OR A SERIOUS OFFENSE SUCH AS THIS AND DOE DOE DOES SAY HEY YOU NEED STRONGER PROTECTIONS IN THESE CASES -- YOU WANT A GOOD DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND YOU WANT SOMEONE TO ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS TO HELP. INSURE THAT YOUR YOUR CASES IS FULLY HEARD AND SO I THINK THAT IS ONE ISSUE THAT WE THAT WE MAY NEED TO WORK THROUGH AND THEN I WOULD ALSO SAY THE STANDARD OF EVIDENCE IN THE WORST PUTTING THAT PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. YEAH THAT'S SORT OF LIKE A THAT'S CORRECT YEAH VERY YEAH. AND WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF A VERY SERIOUS. FRAN IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANYBODY IN JAIL OR PRISON FOR THIS THIS ANY OTHER INTEREST CONSEQUENCES I THINK THEY'RE ALWAYS SERIES CONSEQUENCES AS THERE ARE TO PLAGIARISM AS I MENTIONED AS AN EXAMPLE. I THINK WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE TO DISAGREE PHILOSOPHICALLY THANK YOU THIS IS AWFUL I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AND IT'S DEVASTATING TO HEAR ABOUT ANYBODY WHO IS FALSELY ACCUSED IN ANY SITUATION I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT IF WE HAD THIS MUCH CONVERSATION FOR DECADES ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN -- VIOLATED AND GREAT AND ASSAULTED ON CAMPUS. AT AS WE'RE GIVING DEFENDANTS -- UP I GUESS YOU'RE NOT DEFENDANTS NOT CRIMINAL RIGHT NOW THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE. THE TRUTH IS THAT THAT FOR GENERATIONS WOMEN IN PARTICULAR I I KNOW CAN GO BOTH WAYS BUT WOMEN HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS WITH VERY LITTLE -- NOTICE EVEN AT AND IT HASN'T BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND I'M SORRY THE NUMBERS ARE CORRECT ANY OF US WHO WENT TO COLLEGE CAN TELL YOU HOW MANY OF OUR FRIENDS -- WHERE WERE GIVEN DRINKS TO GET DRUNK TO TAKE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF TO BEING PRESSURED TO IN THIS HAS HAPPENED AND IT AFFECTS THEIR ENTIRE LIFE? IN OVERWHELMINGLY THE NUMBERS WILL SAY FALSE ALLEGATIONS ARE VERY SMALL BY COMPARISON SO. IF THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS. TWEAKS YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THIS AUTHOR WORKS WITH THOSE BUT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I GET THE FEAR OF THE PEOPLE BEING FALSE ACCUSED I HAVE FIVE KIDS FORMER VOICE. RIGHT THERE THE ALL INNER IN COLLEGE I I GOT OR HOPEFULLY MAYBE NOT. BE REALLY EXPENSIVE -- BUT I'M A DAUGHTER WHO WHO WENT TO COLLEGE. EN EN I'M SORRY I WANT THINGS TO CHANGE IT'S TIME FOR THINGS TO CHANGE AND IT IS IT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE PUT UP WITH. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CROSS EXAMINATION OF A BRIEF VICTIM? WE'VE ALL SEEN WHAT HAPPENS THERE THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING BY WHICH WE CAN HAVE A FAIR DISCOVERY A FAX. AND AND NOT PUT RE VICTIMIZE VICTIMS BECAUSE A VAST MAJORITY OF THESE WOMEN WHO COME THROUGH OUR ACTUAL REAL VICTIMS A VERY SMALL MINORITY WE ALWAYS HAVE TO PROTECT. THE MINORITY OF FALSE ALLEGATIONS I I'M THERE I UNDERSTAND I BELIEVE IN DUE PROCESS OR THEIR THEIR LITTLE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO ADD FINE BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORD I MOVE THIS BILL AND I'M. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SPEAK FOR THE VICTIMS AT SOME POINT. THE REAL VICTIM HAVE A MOTION IS THE AND THE SECOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE YOU GOT IT GIVE ME A BETTER SIGNED THEN SORRY. TO BOTHER KALRA AND AND I YOU KNOW. SOMEONE UPS THAT MARKED AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER I I CERTAINLY. UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN OF OF DUE PROCESS I DO THINK THAT WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND WITH THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR. AND AND THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF THAT -- WE'RE EITHER THEY'RE VERY CLOSE AS INDICATED BY THE AUTHOR -- AND AND THERE'S DIPPING OF FACT FINDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF MISTER HEARING IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PURPOSE OF CROSS EXAMINATION A COMMA PROCEEDING. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE HERE -- AND ANYONE -- I THINK THAT. THE THE THE PURPOSE OF A OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING IN THIS CONTEXT IS NOT ONLY TO GET THE FACTS ABOUT -- BUT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT THERE'S OVER OVER ARCHING CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ON THE CAMPUS AS WELL THAT THAT THAT GOES. TO THE PURPOSE OF THESE KINDS OF HEARINGS AS WELL ALSO I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR EITHER THE THE CHAIR OR THE AUTHOR REGARDING. THE USE OF PROXIMATE CAUSE -- I'VE HAD A BILL TOTALLY ON A DIFFERENT ISSUE WHERE -- WE'VE WE CHOSE TO MOVE WITH A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR STANDARD RATHER THAN PROXIMATE CAUSE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE COURTS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE PROXIMATE CAUSE STANDARD. FOR A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR AND GIVE DON'T NEED AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT SOMETHING TO CONSIDER -- BUT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED BY EITHER. THE COMMITTEE STAFF OR OR CHAIR OR BY THE AUTHOR AS DO YOU SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR RATHER THAN -- PROXIMATE CAUSE WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN OUTDATED STANDARD. WELL WE'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT APPRECIATED AND CHESTER TO TO CLOSE -- WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS BILL -- THERE IS A SWEET SPOT THERE I THINK WE'RE THERE -- BUT CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT AND TO APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION -- IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE I'VE GOT -- THREE GRANDSONS. AND I APPRECIATE THOSE ISSUES TOO BUT I DO THINK THAT -- WE'RE AT A POINT NOW WHERE -- WE CAN START IMPLEMENTING THIS IT'LL SEND OUT A NOTICE TO TO EVERYONE THAT -- THIS IS A BEHAVIOR THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY WITH SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OF PEOPLE. CONTINUE TO BEHAVE. ONE OUT OF FIVE WOMEN ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS SAYS THAT SHE'S BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR RAPED THAT JUST.

THE CLASS OF GOOD EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE. HAVE HAD TO SUFFER THE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES [inaudible] WHEN THEY? FILE A GRIEVANCE THEY'RE ALMOST ALWAYS DENIED. SPEAKS SENT TO THE KIND OF FORGOTTEN CLASS. BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS. ARE KIND OF WHAT I WOULD CALL OUR BENCH IN GOVERNMENT. RISING LEADERSHIP. WITHIN THE AGENCIES. WHO? WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE AND ABILITIES QUALIFY [inaudible] FOR PROMOTIONS. AND THEY HAVE A SITUATION THAT DISCOURAGES THAT NOW. THIS CREATES EXCLUDED EMPLOY ARBITRATION ACT IN ARBITRATION IS THE KEY TO WHAT THE BILL TRIES TO ACCOMPLISH. IN THE GRANT THAT A TITLE TO GRIEVANCES BEEN FILED WITH CAL HR. AND IT HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED SATISFACTORY IN THE MULTI REVIEW PROCESS NOW EXTANT [inaudible] THAT THE EMPLOYEE. AND THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION AND CAL HR CAN AGREE. ON ONE ARBITRATOR. THE ARBITRATOR WOULD. PINE A LEGALLY BINDING DECISION WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS. AND THE NON PREVAILING PARTY WOULD PAY. THIS IS KIND OF A LOSER PAY. DISCIPLINE. TO ENSURE THE JOB GETS DONE. THE SECTION TWO DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF TITLE TO DEFINE. WHAT ACTIONS ARE GRIEBEL AND IT WOULD TAKE THAT LIST. AND ALLOW AN EXCLUDED EMPLOYEE TO REQUEST ARBITRATION. IN THOSE AREAS. AFTER EXHAUSTING. THE NORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCESS. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. I DON'T THINK AN ONEROUS BURDEN TO AND ADMINISTRATION. BUT CERTAINLY I THINK IT WOULD BE. NORMATIVELY HELPFUL TO THE VITALITY AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN. OUR ORGANIZATIONS. GIVING HOPE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO VERY TALENTED PEOPLE I DO HAVE WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PARKER AT BEHALF TO CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT I WILL POINT OUT THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD STE -- PREVENT WHAT JUST RECENTLY HAPPENED AFTER TWELVE YEAR LEGAL BATTLE -- THE SPEECH CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT RULED -- THAT. A CORRECTION SUPERVISORS WERE OF ENTITLED TO A A REMEDY -- OTHER THA WHAT THE STATE THOUGHT THIS. LAWSUIT COULD HAVE BEEN OVER IN FORTY FIVE DAYS WOULD HAVE SAVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES. AND EXT. A PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN BACK PAY THAT THESE OFFICERS OR GOING TO BE LOOKING AT GOING FORWARD SO WE STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP THE SYSTEM AND IS. I HAVE -- FORD CANNOT FROM THE CORRECTIONS SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLEASE. THE MORNING -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE -- MY NAME'S FOR COULD NOT -- ADMINISTRATIVE LIAISON. FOR THE CALIFORNIA CREDENTIALS SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION. AND WE REPRESENT SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS IN CORRECTIONS AND ITS PARTNERS STATE HOSPITALS. I'VE BEEN WORKING -- WOODS GRIEVANCES FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AND UGH THIS OF JUST HAVING OF THE ARBITRATION AS A FIFTH STEP WOULD IMPROVE OUR GRIEVANCE SYSTEM. THIS THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES -- OF COLLEGE ARE WOULD. WOULDN'T EVER TO OF RESOLVE ISSUES AT A LOWER LEVEL RATHER THAN WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW IS IS JUST DENYING ALL GRIEVANCES AND CAUSING US TO GO. TO A SUPERIOR COURT WHICH TAKES YEARS. AND COSTS WAY MORE THAN THAN -- THE FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT -- ARBITRATION WHAT CAUSED AND IT ALSO -- LOSER PAYS IS -- GOOD IDEA THAT WAY -- SUPERVISORY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS MINING WOULD -- NOT OF BRING UP OF FRIVOLOUS -- OF ISSUES BECAUSE WE WOULD END UP HAVING TO PAY FOR THE ARBITRATION. SEOUL -- IT IT WOULD -- CAUSE US -- TO COME TOGETHER RESOLVE ISSUES AT A LOWER LEVEL JUST JUST HAVING. THAT ARBITRATION OF THE SITTING THERE TO BE READY TO BE USED IF WE HAVE TO I DOUBT THAT WILL EVER HAVE. TO USE IT BUT MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE ON SOMETHING THAT WE BOTH. THE STATE AND SUPERVISORS OF FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT ME AT THAT THEY WERE BOTH RIGHT BUT I DOUBT THAT -- THAT WOULD EVER COME TO FRUITION WE PROBABLY WILL RESOLVE MADE A LOWER LEVEL. I DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU I AM READY FOR ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT GRIEVANCES I'VE. DONE FOR TWENTY YEARS. OTHERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBER STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR NECESSITIES FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AND SUPPORT AND JUST WANT TO THANK SENATOR NAY NIELSEN FOR HIS.

I WOULD REQUEST AN AYE VOTE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I CHAU CHIU. CHU AYE GONZALEZ CONSOLES I HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY. KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS REYES. THAT NEEDS ONE MORSEL PLACE ABOVE CALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS SENATOR HERTZBERG [inaudible] TEXAS. TO I WAS NUMBER. ONE ALL RIGHT CENTER WIECKOWSKI. WE WILL DO SB THREE TWENTY THREE I HAVE A SHORT HEARING AND SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAYS ALL RIGHT -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST OFF I ACCEPT THE MEMON SOME PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS AND THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS CONCISE YET THOROUGH ANALYSIS -- UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME CORRUPT AND DYSFUNCTIONAL. H. AWAY PORTS THAT EXCLUDING DISENFRANCHISES OTHER H. AWAY MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY THE SEEK TO CHALLENGE THEIR EXISTING REGIME. H. WAY PORTS CONFINED HOMEOWNERS TAKE THEM TO THE COURT EVEN FOR CLOSE ON THEIR HOMES SO THESE H. WE BOARD ELECTIONS -- NO SMALL MATTER. I WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL IS MUCH NARROWER THAN LAST YEAR'S BILL WHICH PASSED OUT OF THE COMMITTEE AND IN THE HOUSE. TALK ABOUT THE VETO MESSAGE FOR INSTANCE I'VE AGREED TO ADD IN SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS IS GROUNDS FOR DISQUALIFICATION. SECONDLY I'VE REMOVE SOME PRIVACY CONCERNS. THIRDLY I'VE DELETED THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE VOTE COUNTING LOCATION BE ACCESSIBLE IN NEAR THE H. AWAY PROPERTY AND FINALLY HAVE ALLEVIATED ALL CONCERNS WITH THE BUILDING -- INDUSTRY. SO A RICHER AYE VOTE IN WITH ME I HAVE -- JUDGE TOM SIR WITH THE CENTER OF CALIFORNIA H. AWAY LAW AND SHELLY -- THE STAFF. NO H. AWAY RESIDENT AND FORMER BOARD MEMBER. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU SENATOR -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M TOM SIR -- THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW THE CENTER IS DEDICATED TO ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS. OF INDIVIDUAL. OF HOMEOWNERS WHO LIVE IN H. AWAY GOVERN. DEVELOPMENTS -- THE CENTER WAS A KEY PARTICIPANT IN THE WRITING OF THE EXISTING LEGISLATION. THAT SEEKS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS TO HAVE FAIR ELECTIONS. THE OUR FOUNDING PRESIDENT MARJORIE MARIE WAS VERY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE WRITING OF THAT LEGISLATION. AND IN THE INTERVENING YEARS SINCE ITS PASSAGE IN ABOUT -- TWO THOUSAND FIVE WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS FROM ALL AROUND THE STATE. OF MANY. INGENIOUS AND DEVIOUS PRACTICES THAT HAVE EMERGED OVER THE YEARS. TO GET AROUND THE VARIOUS PROTECTIONS AND SO. WE NOW PRESENT THIS BILL THAT I'D NOTED EVERY. PROVISION IN. SB THREE TWO THREE IS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT ABUSES THAT HAVE BEEN. REPORTED TO THE CENTER FROM ALL AROUND THE STATE. YOU WILL HEAR IT IN DETAIL SOME OF THE SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE ABUSES IN JUST A MOMENT. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS AT THE END OF THE BILL. WHICH CHANGES THE WAY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURTS -- HANDLE THESE CASES ONCE THERE'S A CHALLENGE TO AN ELECTION -- THE CURRENT. WORDING. GIVES THE COURT. DISCRETION TO GRANT -- INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THAT IS TO CANCEL THE ELECTION [inaudible] AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOT PUT INTO THE LEGISLATION EDITED OUT SAID. THIS WAS A SUGGESTION -- AN IDEA FROM THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION AND THAT IS TO ALLOW HOMEOWNERS ACCESS TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT. TO RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES. NOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT NIGHT SPEAK AS A FORMER. US SMALL CLAIMS JUDGE I HEARD MANY MANY CASES AND I CONTINUE TO DO SO ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS SOLANO COUNTY -- I WAS ON THE BENCH AND ALAMEDA COUNTY SO I GOT SOME EXPERIENCE IN. TWO VENUES. AND I BELIEVE THE REASON THAT WE GET COMPLAINTS ABOUT SMALL CLAIMS COURTS NOT. ADMINISTERING JUSTICE -- IS THAT. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS A RATHER UNUSUAL REMEDY. IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. BY AND LARGE. SMALL THINGS GO TO NOT HAVE. INJECTIVE AUTHORITY AND SO TO GRANTED IN THIS STATUTE IS AN EXCEPTION. A RARE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE AND YOU HAVE MANY. SMALL CLAIMS CALENDARS ARE HEARD BY -- PRO TEM JUDGES SEES A VOLUNTEER JUDGES AND AND THAT'S HOW I WORK NOW IN FACT IN SOLANO COUNTY IS IS A VOLUNTEER. PRO TEM JUDGE BUT MOST OF THE MY COLLEAGUES. PRO TEM JUDGES. ARE PRACTICING LAWYERS WHO MAY NOT BE VERY FAMILIAR AT ALL WITH THIS AREA OF THE LAW CENTER THEY'RE NOT A WE TO WRAP UP PLEASE THANK YOU -- SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE. PUT SOME. FIRM GUIDANCE INTO THE BILL -- I WOULD JUST INDICATE THEN THAT IN CLOSING THAT. THE FAIR ELECTIONS ARE REALLY ONLY PROTECTION AVAILABLE TO HOMEOWNERS TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE. SELF GOVERNANCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SHELLY DISTEFANO -- ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO. ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MOVING INTO MY H. AWAY IT BECAME OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY WAS ROUTINELY COORDINATING WITH BOARD. THE BOARD ON ACTIONS THAT VIOLATED STATE STATUTE IN GOVERNING DOCUMENTS THEY'RE ENGAGING IMPROPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS AND CONTRACTORS. AND THEY USE THEIR POWER TO BALI INTIMIDATE AND SILENCE HOMEOWNERS WHO PUSHED BACK. AND AND IT'S EFFECTIVE I EXPERIENCED THIS FIRST HAND IN COORDINATION WITH THE PROPERTY MANAGER THAT YOU SPECIFIC STRATEGIES TO MANIPULATE THAT I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE -- ELECTIONS AND REMOVE BOARD MEMBERS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST BOARD MANAGEMENT BEHAVIOR THAT IS UNETHICAL ILLEGAL OR CONTRARY TO BEST PRACTICES MY FIRST BIG PUSH BACK WAS. A RECORD REQUEST AFTER I FIRST MOVED IN I DISCOVERED ALL KINDS OF BIDDING AND CONTRACTING YOUR REGULARITIES INCLUDING A PRIMA FACIE CASE. OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY BOARDING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY AND A BITTER IT'S ON ON A HALF MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT I STOP THIS CONTRACT WITH WHAT YOU TO GO TO THE PRESS. SINCE THEN ALL MY RECORD REQUEST AND I HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE BEEN DENIED -- I QUICKLY DISCOVERED THE ST AT THE SAME SMALL CLIQUE OF HOMEOWNERS HAVE BEEN ROTATING ON THE BOARD INCLUDING WITH THE SAME MANAGEMENT COMPANY FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT MANAGEMENT. COMPANY IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR AND BOARD MALFEASANCE OF THE INCIDENTS I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE. IN IT AS IS TYPICAL BOARD MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERTISE IN HEAVILY RELY ON THE PROPERTY MANAGER FOR DIRECTION. WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE WELL A REVIEW OF RECORDS SHOW THAT OUR MANAGEMENT COMPANY MAKES A LOT MORE MONEY ON OUR H. AWAY THAN THE MERE FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR MONTHLY. MAJESTY THE CHARGES ARE BOARD INVOICES THE PROPERTY MANAGER COMPANIES FOR IN HOUSE H. AWAY SERVICES -- FOR MULTIPLE SERVICES AT A AT A PREMIUM COST FOR EXAMPLE THE CHART FOR SERVING IT AS ELECTION SPECTER AND AND THE COST THAT WE PAY THE ELECTIONS PICKED WE COULD HIRE. AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY -- USING THEIR CONFERENCE FACILITY WHICH IS THIRTY MINUTES AWAY EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A FACILITY USE RIGHT IN IN OUR CESSATION -- WE STRIPING PARKING PLACE AS THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON THE STATE CHARGED US OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO RESTART BE ONE PARKING PLACE -- IT A MINIMUM CHARGE WOULD HAVE BEEN -- THREE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST TO COME OUT FOR ONE WHEN BASS SO WE'VE TRIED DURING THE LAST FOUR ELECTION CYCLE TO CHANGE THE BOARD MAKE UP -- AND THEN THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE STRATEGIES THAT THEY'VE USED TO DISQUALIFY -- INTERESTED OR DISCOURAGE INTERESTED HOMEOWNERS FROM RUNNING TO REMOVE NON COMPLIANT MORE MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE ANOTHER PERSON WAS TOLD THEY WEREN'T ELIGIBLE -- BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS OUT OVER THERE GARAGE. A VICIOUS DOOR TO DOOR SMEAR CAMPAIGN RESULT IN REMOVAL OF ANOTHER NEWLY ELECTED BOARD MEMBER. WHO WANTED IT A THIRD PARTY ELECTION SPECTER AND HE WANTED TO GO OUT TO BID ON A NEW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US HAVE WHO HAVE BEEN REMOVED HAVE IN COMMON? THE ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT BOARD MEETINGS I WAS THAT EACH OF THE MEETINGS HE NEVER HARASS ANYBODY. YEAH THE PROBLEM WAS HE HAS DARK SKIN AND OF THE PEOPLE ON THE BOARD DO NOT AND THEY MADE UP SOME TRUMPED UP THING THAT OTHER PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT RUINED THAT MAN. HE'S A FAMILY MAN HE HAS A DAUGHTER IT IT'S IT'S STILL HEART BREAKING INTO OVERSEAS. EXCUSE ME I NEED TO WRAP UP PLEASE OKAY YES -- IT'S SOMEWHAT SO THEY RETALIATED AGAINST ME -- THEY THEY HAVE -- CITED ME FOR I'D. SIX DIFFERENT VIOLATIONS WITHOUT EVIDENCE BEHIND AN ATTORNEY -- IT SAYING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SHARE THE THE EVIDENCE WITH ME WHICH IS IMPROPER. THEY HAVE MOST RECENTLY -- IS SENT. TELLING COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT I HAVE A DRUG DEPENDENCY AND THAT I HAD HAD A A PSYCH. PSYCHIATRIC BREAKDOWN OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS NONE OF WHICH IS TRUE I'VE GOT A DOCTOR'S NOTE -- CONFIRMING THAT IT'S NOT TRUE THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO ACTUALLY -- SEND THE LETTER TO A COLLEAGUE OF MINE THAT I'M WORKING WITH AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THEY WILL GO TO KNOW THEY'VE BEEN AT ANOTHER NUMBER BUT EXAMPLES OF WHICH THEY HAVE LIED IN ORDER TO GET. TO CHILL TO TO CREATE A CHILLING EFFECT TO THE PEOPLE LIKE ME AND OTHERS WHO AREN'T QUITE WHO. WHO WHO ARE MORE AFRAID IT SO BASICALLY SAID WE DON'T? CHALLENGE THEM AND THANK YOU IT'S A PROBLEM THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. THANK YOU JOE RIGHT OUT CONSUMER ACTION. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN TODAY ON BEHALF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. HOW WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL? WE DO BELIEVE THAT MOST ELECTIONS WITHIN THE FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ARE HANDLED FAIRLY AND ARE OPEN -- AS WAS STATED BY THE AUTHOR THE BILL WE HAVE -- ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AND COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RULES IN THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTIONS -- THERE ARE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND ASSOCIATIONS -- IN THE STATE 70% OF THEM ARE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MAKE AN EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE IN COMPLEX SET OF RULES EVEN MORE SO WHICH COULD LIKELY END UP IN MORE MISTAKES. MORE LITIGATION. ONE NEW ISSUE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL. IS RATE IN THE ANALYSIS HAS THE A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT AND THAT WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE THE OR OR DELETE THE ONE SECTION OF THE THE BILL THAT SAYS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS HAD A PAST CONVICTION IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS FOR EMBEZZLEMENT FORGERY ETCETERA. CANNOT SIT ON THE BOARD -- TO US THAT RAISES SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WON THE ELECTION CODE SECTION TWENTY A PROHIBITS ANYONE WITH A PAST CONVICTION OF EMBEZZLEMENT FORGERY OR OTHER FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES FROM SERVING IN LOCAL OR STATE OFFICE -- BUT WE WON'T ANNA OF A P. AND WE WANTED HERE TO THE SAME ROLE FOR AN ASSOCIATION WHOSE BOARD MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS. TO ALL INFORMATION OF MEMBERS FINANCIAL PERSONAL EXCEPT TRUCK. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR ASSOCIATIONS IN THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FROM FIDELITY BOND INSURANCE WHICH IS NOW A REQUIRED BY LAW IN OTHER INSURANCE MATTER SO. WE THINK THAT THIS -- AMENDMENT. CHARACTERIZE THIS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS ACTUALLY CREATE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR ASSOCIATIONS ARE ALL AROUND THE STATE. WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PEACE THE BILL THAT SHIFTS THE BURDEN -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGE OF AN ELECTION? THE MAY FIRST VERSION OF THIS BILL. TOOK IT BACK TO A MORE BALANCED APPROACH LEAVING THAT DISCRETION TO THE JUDGE THE VERSION OF THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU NOW SHIPS THAT BURDEN SO THAT A COURT MUST THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION. IF. THE ASSOCIATION CANNOT PROVE THAT THE MISTAKE I DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT SO NOW THESE ASSOCIATIONS ARE IN THE POSITION OF ADDITIONAL LITIGATION WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVE A NEGATIVE SO -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A AN EASY WAY TO ADDRESS THIS MORE ELEGANT A WAY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF RULES CHANGING FOR THE ELECTIONS. AND THAT IS TO REQUIRE ELECTION QUALIFICATIONS ELECTION A RECOMMENDATION SIMPLY TO BE PART OF THE BY LAWS INSTEAD OF PART OF THE RULE PROCESS THAT'S OUTLINED IN DAVIS STERLING. SO IT'S FOR THOSE REASONS -- THAT WE OPPOSE THE BILL AND WILL BE ASKING FOR NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU EXODUS PLACE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER WHAT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS. ALSO OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE JUST UP PREVIOUSLY LAID OUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL COSTS AND ASSOCIATION ARE BORED BY ALL THE HOMEOWNERS WITHIN THE ASSOCIATION. SO WE DO HAVE CONCERN TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU. MAKE THESE THESE ROLES ARE THE LAWS MORE COMPLEX AND IT INCREASES COST -- FOR THE ASSOCIATION IT IS THE OTHER HOMEOWNERS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BEAR THE BRUNT OF THATCOSTS SO WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SIGNAL SATURDAY MAY CLOSE I REGION I VOTE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE DEPARTMENT REAL IT STATE AND THE OBJECTORS AS I HAVE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. I NEED A MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND AND THE SECOND THANK YOU THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED -- PLEASE STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHOW. CHOW I CHOOSE. CHIU AYE GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS REYES. THAT'S THE BILL CALLS TO THE CITIES WERE MORE ABOUT THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NOW SAID HERTZBERG. SB [inaudible] THREE FORTY TWO YES [inaudible] EVERYBODY -- IN THE OLD DAYS. THE RIVER GONZALEZ THE OLD DAYS. TICKET SCALPERS PREDOMINATED. FRAUDULENT TICKET SALES RED AT SPORTING EVENTS TODAY WE'VE GOT THIS NEW FANGLED THING CALLED THE INTERNET [inaudible] AND ALL. AT SO I JUST IT'S A ED ED. WE WE THERE'S NEW WAYS AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OF ALL EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU SUGGESTED AND SECONDLY I CARE I APPRECIATE YOUR YOU'RE FREE LEGAL WORK ON THIS BILL -- YOU GUYS EAT YOU MADE SOME GOOD CHANGES I THOUGHT IN THE FIRST PART OF IT THE SECOND TRUNCHEON IS CAUSING SOME HEARTBURN FOR THE FOLKS AT A E. G. AND AND LIVE NATION I THINK -- SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN DO THAT BUT BUT LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IN THE SMALL CASES WHERE WE BECAUSE OF BOB WAS A PROP SIXTY FOR THE LIKE WITH SOME LIMITATION A LAW THE FEDERAL LAW THE LIKE IT'S WE'RE TRYING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE TEETH -- AND AND THIS INCENTIVIZE IS FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR WHERE PEOPLE ARE -- BASICALLY YOU KNOW USE THESE THESE WEBSITES THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT ARE ROB. THAT ARE STOKER'S SPORTING EVENTS IN THE REALLY I MEAN IS THE BELONG TO THE THE THE COMPANY THAT THE FRANCHISE AND THEY'RE REALLY NOT. AND SO THIS IS JUST AN EFFORT TO TRY. TO THE TRY TO BETTER MANAGE THAT GIVEN WHAT BILLS YOU KNOW SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED AT SAC IN THE FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE LIKE IN DEALING WITH SOME OF THE NUANCES AS A RESULT OF THAT IS YOUR KEENLY AWARE BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THAT -- PUBLIC EPHESTO TURNED OVER. TO MY WITNESS THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THE MORNING CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIAN HAS I AM THE EXECUTIVE RECTOR OF SPORTS FANS COALITION WHICH IS THE NATION'S LEADING FAN ADVOCACY GROUP. AND TODAY ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA SPORTS FANS I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR SB. THREE FORTY TWO FOR THE LAST DECADE SPORTS FANS COALITION HAS FOUGHT FOR FANS WE TACKLE ISSUES SUCH AS THE PUBLIC FINANCING SPORTS STADIUMS SPORTS BETTING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS MEDIA ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME FANS PASSING SB THREE FORTY TWO IN A RICH SPORTS CULTURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S WOULD BE A MASSIVE BLOW. TO THE FRAUDSTERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FANS. ESPECIALLY LESS TECH SAVVY FANS BY USING MISLEADING MARKETING TACTICS. WHITE LABEL TICKET SITES TO SEE FANS WHO THINK THEY'RE BUYING DIRECTLY FROM VENUE BOX OFFICE AT FACE VALUE. BUT IN REALITY ARE BUYING FROM A THIRD PARTY PRETENDING TO BE THE OFFICIAL SITE. ONE HERE ADVOCATE TO PROTECT SPORTS FANS THIS FRAUD IMPACTS ALL FANS OF LIVE EVENTS INCLUDING CONCERTS AND THEATER. WHITE LABEL FRAUD WORKS LIKE THIS A CONSUMER USES GOGLE OR ANOTHER SEARCH ENGINE TO TO SEARCH FOR TICKETS TO AN EVENT OR VENUE MANY SITES WHICH HAVE TICKETS FOR SALE DISPLAYED. BUT DESPITE NOT BEING LICENSED OR OFFICIAL THE SITES MAY USE WORDS LIKE OFFICIAL OR BOX OFFICE IN RELATION TO THE VENUE OR EVENT. UNDER THE BELIEF THAT THE CONSUMER IS ON THE REAL TICKET SITE THEY'LL PURCHASE A TICKET AFTER COMPLETING SEVERAL STEPS IN THE CHECKOUT PROCESS THE CONSUMERS HIT WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL FEES WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THE COST. IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SPORTS FANS COALITION BEGAN INVESTIGATING THIS PRACTICE WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS MORE RAMPANT FRAUD THAN WE HAD INITIALLY BELIEVES. WE RECENTLY REPLICATED THE STUDY AND DESPITE ATTEMPTS BY INDUSTRY THE DECEPTIVE WEBSITES CONTINUE TO PLAGUE SEARCH ENGINES AND TO FRAUD FANS. THE DANGERS OF THIS PRACTICE GO BEYOND JUST FOOLING FANS IN THE CLICKING ON THEIR SITE. THERE ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR SPORTS FANS FOR EXAMPLE RESELLERS USING VIVID OR TICKET NETWORKS WHITE LABEL PLATFORMS FOR THE DECEMBER SIXTEENTH RAMS VERSE EAGLES GAME.

SPORTS FANS COALITION BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF THE SEPT OF YOU YOUR AL SHOULD BE BANNED. ON THE COST OF CALIFORNIA'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOOTBALL SEASON WITH THE RAMS TICKETS BEING A HOT COMMODITY AFTER THEIR AMAZING SUPERBOWL RUN LAST YEAR.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR HERTZBERG -- MY NAME IS MARK A PRAYER WITH THE FIRM OF THE PREY AND THE CAYLEE. AND ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT A E. G. AN ACCESS. WE WISH TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTY FOUR AS A THREE FORTY TWO THIS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. EIJI IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST OWNER OF SPORTS TEAMS AND SPORTS EVENTS AND IS ALSO THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST PRESENTER. OF LIVE MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT EVENTS. ACCESS PARTIALLY OWNED BY AG IS A DIGITAL MARKETPLACE PLATFORM FOR PURCHASING TICKETS FOR SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT EVENTS IN THE US AND AND AND OVERSEAS. AS COMPANIES WHO PARTNER WITH THOSE WHO ARE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO LIVE ENTERTAINMENT. WE SPEND TIME AND ENERGY FIGHTING THE DECEPTIVE TICKET PRACTICES OF OTHERS. TO ENSURE THAT FANS RECEIVE LEGITIMATE TICKETS FROM THE PARTIES WHO HAVE INTEREST INVESTED IN THE EVENT. WE ARE CLIENTS WANT OUR FANS TO BE ABLE TO BUY A REAL AND AUTHENTIC TICKET. THROUGH A SECURE AND TRUSTED SYSTEM WITHOUT RISK OF BEING CONFUSED OR MISLED BY ROGUE THIRD PARTY WEBSITES WHO DO NOT SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS FOR EITHER CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. ARE THOSE MAKING REAL INVESTMENTS. THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE STUBHUB EARLIER THIS YEAR APPROACHED US ABOUT SUPPORTING THE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED ON FEBRUARY. NINETEEN EIGHTY G. ACCESS EXPRESSED ITS SUPPORT FOR SB THREE FORTY TWO IN THE SENATE. AND BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE AS IT WAS AMENDED IN THE SENATE ON MAY SEVENTEEN AND IN PRIOR VERSIONS. WE SUPPORTED THE BILL BECAUSE THAT VERSION WE BELIEVE -- WOULD REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DISHONEST MARKETING PRACTICES -- IMMUNITY LEADING INTERNET SEARCHES USING THE VENUE OR ARTIST NAME TO BAIT CUSTOMERS INTO BELIEVING THEY ARE PURCHASING THE TICKETS DIRECTLY FROM A VENUE. THEREBY LEADING TO A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE RECEIVED A SET OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ON WEDNESDAY OF LAST WEEK. AND ACCESS AND LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT YESTERDAY SUBMITTED A JOINT LETTER THAT YOU HAVE IN OPPOSITION. IN OUR LETTER WE STATED WE DO NOT BELIEVE THREE FORTY TWO IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED OFFERS PROTECTIONS THAT ARE BETTER. GREATER OR CLEARER THAN EXISTING LAW SPECIFICALLY THE PROTECTIONS OFFERED UNDER BUSINESS PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION. FOURTEEN TO FORTY FIVE REGARDING TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT AND SECTION SEVENTEEN FIVE HUNDRED MISLEADING ADVERTISING. IN FACT. SB THREE FORTY TWO DOES NOT STOP DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. THAT BAD BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SEVENTEEN FIVE HUNDRED ALREADY ADDRESSES. IN AN EMAIL EXCHANGE WITH THE COMMITTEE'S CHIEF CONSULTANT SHE REPLIED I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH ACCESS AND LIVE NATION'S GENERAL ARGUMENT. THAT NO ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY BECAUSE STATUTES ALREADY ADDRESS FALSE AND MISLEADING ADVERTISING AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT. AND WE CONCUR. THEREFORE IF THE CHOICE IS SB THREE FORTY TWO OR NO CHANGE IN LAW WE SIDE WITH NO CHANGE IN LAW. CONSUMERS ARTISTS VENUES AND THOSE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TRADEMARK RIGHTS WE BELIEVE ARE BETTER SERVED BY EXISTING LAW THEN THE PROVISIONS IN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN SB. THREE FORTY TWO AND WE THEREFORE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THREE FORTY TWO AND JOURNAL VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GREG HER ON BEHALF OF LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT TICKET MASTER. LIVE NATION IS THE WORLD'S Là LEADING LIVE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY AND ANNUALLY IS INVOLVED WITH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND SHOWS AND SELLS OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TICKETS. ON BEHALF OF ARTISTS BROADWAY SHOWS SPORTS TEAMS UNIVERSITIES STADIUMS AMPHITHEATERS AND OTHER VENUES. THIS INCLUDES ARE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA BASED EMPLOYEES THAT WORK OR SUPPORT A TOYOTA AMPHITHEATRE SLEEP TRAIN AMPHITHEATRE AND CRICKETS CRICKET WIRELESS AMPHITHEATER THE ROSE BOWL. FIVE POINT TAMPA FEEDER NOSSA VENT CENTER THE MASONIC THE FILLMORE AN ORACLE PARK TO JUST NAME A FEW. ELENI WORKS CLOSELY VERY CLOSELY WITH ARTISTS AND VENUES AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE BUSINESSES TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FAN ACCESS AND QUALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE. TO THAT END WE STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORTS AT ALLOW ARTISTS VENUE OWNERS. AND THE FANS THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM FRAUDULENT AND DECEPTIVE OPERATORS. THE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT PASSED WITH NO OPPOSITION AND RECEIVE NO NO VOTES IN ANY COMMITTEE AS LATE AS JUNE TWENTY FIFTH. ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL ABILITY TO ADDRESS IMPACTS OF FRAUD AND DECEPTION. WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT VERSION OF THE BILL. HOWEVER WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO CONSIDER A COMPLETELY NEW VERSION OF BILL IN THE SECOND POLICY COMMITTEE. WE REVIEWED BOTH VERSION OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED TO US THE MOST RECENT VERSION AS A FOUR PM LAST NIGHT. OUR CONCLUSION IS THE AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR WILL PROVIDE NO BENEFITS TO THOSE IT IS INTENDED TO ASSIST. AND ONE COMPARED TO EXISTING LAW. IT WILL UNINTENTIONALLY A ROAD THE CURRENT PROTECTIONS PROVIDED UNDER STATUTES AND CASE LAW. AS THE WORLD'S LEADING LIVE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY THAT SUPPORTS HUNDREDS OF VENUES THOUSAND THOUSANDS OF ATHLETES AND ARTISTS THE MILLIONS OF FANS IN CALIFORNIA OUR GOAL MUST BE FIRST TO DO NO HARM. FOR THESE REASONS AND THOSE STATED BY MISTER PRATT LIVE NATION MUST OPPOSE SB FOR THE EIGHT THREE FORTY TWO AS A PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE BILL BE HELD IN COMMITTEES OF THE PRESIDENT AND MAY CAN BE A PROPERLY VENTED TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY AND CONSUMERS THAT WILL IMPACT. WE SHARED THE AMENDMENTS ASSEMBLY DENTISTRY LAST NIGHT AND HOW HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASKED TO RELAY THE OPPOSITION OF FELD ENTERTAINMENT TO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. HE WAS YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION ASHLEY WALKER WITH NASA MEN ON BEHALF OF FELD ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL OPPOSED TO THE RECENT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SCENERY BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] SCULLY. THANK YOU SO I SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE AND IN TRYING. TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE AMENDMENTS -- CAN YOU JUST HAVE TO THE OPPOSITION EXPAND ON WHY YOU THINK THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD. A ROAD THE PROTECTIONS OF EXISTING LAW TODAY IT SOMEHOW SUPERSEDE. EXISTING LAW -- AND THEN IF THE AUTHOR WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL I'M HAPPY -- TO SO THE NEW LAW WILL LANGUAGE HAS A PROVISION THAT INDICATES THAT HAVE IT ARTIST NAME IS USED IN THE CONTEXT. OF A MUSICAL WORK OF ART OR OTHER SIMILAR ARTISTIC REFERENCES IT WON'T VIOLATE THE LAW THIS IS NOT ONLY CONFUSING. IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION IS. WE THINK IT'S IRRELEVANT. THAT RELATES TO SOME COPYRIGHT DEFENSE THAT WOULD BE WHOLLY IN APPLICABLE TO ANY COMMERCIAL WEBSITE I NOTE THAT. IN ANY OTHER STATE WHERE WE HAVE WORKED ON LEGISLATION THAT PROHIBITS DECEPTIVE U. R. L. PRACTICES. THAT SORT OF CUMBERSOME CARVE OUT HAS NOT BEEN INCLUDED AND SO I AGAIN I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS. I AM HAPPY TO RECITE FURTHER EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S IN THIS ELECTION THE STATUTE. AS AN EXAMPLE IN OTHER WORDS WE WOULD HAVE TO ALSO PROVE BAD FAITH ON THE PART OF THE PERPETRATOR SIMPLY BY THEY'RE PUTTING UP A FALSE WEBSITE. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- AGAIN WITH IN ON NO PREJUDICE TO THE AUTHOR'S INTENT OR THE SPONSORS INTENT. THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE BILL BEFORE YOU AS PROPOSED TO BE AN AMENDED WE THINK REDUCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. REDUCE THE RIGHTS OF TRADEMARK AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY HOLDERS AND MAKE IT MORE CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO ASSERT THOSE RIGHTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSING THE MEASURE. VISIT YOU CAN ASK FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ELABORATION ON THIS AT FIRST ME JUST SAY APPRECIATE THE THE AUTHOR. OF FOR FOR MOVING FORWARD IN THIS AREA I FOR ONE HAVE. BEEN VERY CONFUSED AND I TRY TO BUY TICKETS ONLINE AND I ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS A REAL PROBLEM HERE -- AND I DEFINITELY THINK THAT -- THE VERSIONS OF THE BILL UNTIL IT CAME TO THIS COMMITTEE -- WERE WERE CLEAR I HAVE TO MISS I AM A LITTLE -- I AM ALSO A BIT -- A PROBABLY CONFUSED ABOUT SOME OF THE DIRECTION OF WHERE THE BILL AS I KNOW THAT THERE'S NEW LANGUAGE THAT INCREASES. AROUND BAD FAITH AND AND THAT TO ME I'M I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER -- YOU KNOW WE ARE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PROVE WITHOUT INTENT -- I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME QUESTION AROUND. THE NEW LANGUAGE LIMITING IT TO CERTAIN TYPES OF MARKS AND QUESTIONS AROUND THE FIRST MEMBER BUT I ALSO WORRY THAT THERE MIGHT BE A AND NARROWING OF THAT. I LIKE TO US THE AUTHOR -- WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE IN SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AT THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED DO YOU THINK THERE'S A PATH HERE TO RESOLVING THESE ISSUES -- BOTH YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW IS IS CLEAR -- THAT DOESN'T CREATE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES BUT ALSO. NOT INADVERTENTLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO WHAT TO DO WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO HERE. WELL. SIR YOU'RE WELCOME TO BUT A LOT OF THESE CHANGES COME FOR ME THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ASSIST YOU IN OUT I WAS GONNA ASK CHAU JUST GONNA SAY IF IF. IT SO WHAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND CENTER I APPRECIATE YOU. BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON THIS IS IS GOES BACK TO THE FORMATION OF DOMAIN NAMES AND HOW THAT IS PUT TOGETHER. TRADE. IN DOMAIN NAMES ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND WHEN TO MAY NAMES WERE NEW TWENTY PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO GET TO MAY NAMES AND STARTED TO BE. SUED BY OR OR GONE AFTER BY TRADEMARK OWNERS WHO WANTED TO TO CLAIM THAT DOMAIN NAME AS THEIR TRADEMARK WHEN THEY WERE PLENTY OF APPROPRIATE USES OF THOSE DOMAIN NAMES. SO WHAT I DID NOT WANT TO DO HERE IS TO TO FACILITATE. THE TRAY TRADEMARK OWNER IN THESE CASES BEING ABLE TO GO AFTER SOMEONE WHO HAS A DOMAIN NAME. LEGITIMATELY. FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSE OR FOR A PARITY PURPOSE OR ANY OTHER FIRST AMENDMENT PURPOSE. AND HAVE SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE A TRADEMARK THEN GO AFTER AND SHUT DOWN IN CHANGE A DOMAIN NAME. SO THAT CREATES A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY WANT TO VERY TIGHTLY CONTROL THEIR TRADEMARK. BY CONTROLLING DOMAIN NAMES AND THOSE AGAIN ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS SO IF THERE IS A SPORTS STAR OR ENTERTAINMENT STORE SOMEBODY ELSE. WHO AND SOMEONE HAD IT HAS SOME CRITICISM OF THEM AND CREATES A PARITY ACCOUNTS? LEGITIMATELY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD NOT WANT TO BE SHUT DOWN UNDER THE RULES THAT ARE BEING CREATED HERE. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WE ARE TRYING TO FACILITATE THE FRAUDULENT. SELLING OF TICKETS AND OTHER ASPECTS WHERE WE AGREE WE DO NOT WANT THAT BEHAVIOR BUT WHAT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO DO IS MAKE IS GIVE TOOLS. TO TRADEMARK OWNERS ADDITIONAL TOOLS A TRADEMARK OWNERS TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER TO THEM INCONVENIENT DOMAINS AND DOMAIN NAMES. IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT. COMBATING FRAUD NOT COMBATING INAPPROPRIATE USES BUT ARE LEGITIMATE USES SO THAT'S THE SENSITIVITY WERE REALLY TRYING TO SOLVE HERE. IT IS STILL GO AFTER THE FRAUDULENT USES OF NAMES THE MISDIRECTION OF A FAN WHO WANTS TO GO TO A CONCERT WAS BECAUSE THAT WE WANT THEM TO GO TO THE CORRECT SITES. BY SOMEONE WHO PUTS UP LEGITIMATELY USES IT A DOMAIN NAME CREATES A WEBSITE. THAT HAS NO CONNECTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. THEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE BEING PROSECUTED UNDER THIS AND THAT WAS MY CONCERN THAT THIS WAS BROADLY ENOUGH WRITTEN. THAT NOW A TRADEMARK OWNER IS GOING TO GO AFTER A DOMAIN NAME EIGHT A DOMAIN. THAT IS OUT ON THE INTERNET WHOSE PURPOSE IS UNRELATED TO THE FRAUD THAT'S BEING PERPETRATED. IF I COULD JUST ASK ONE FALL QUESTIONS I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D WANT. TO LIMIT THIS TO CERTAIN TYPES OF MARKS I GUESS. THE THE BURDEN OF PROOF WITH REGARDS TO BAD FAITH -- I'M WONDERING HOW YOU BALANCE ADDED NOT BUT WHAT I'M CONCERNED BUT AS I JUST READ IT IT SEEMS IF YOU ARE IT IT WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE THESE CASES. WONDER IF YOU THOUGHT OF THE GAP. POTENTIALLY BUT AGAIN THE THE BALANCE BETWEEN PROSECUTING THESE CASES OF FRAUD. AND ABUSE OF A A TRADEMARK VIS A VIS A DOMAIN NAME IS WHAT. TRYING TO TO THREAD SO IN CASES WHERE. SOMEBODY'S USING A DOMAIN NAME WITH THE INTENT TO DECEIVE A CONSUMER AND GO GET THAT CONSUMERS BUSINESS AS AND REDIRECT THEM FROM. A LEGITIMATE SITE IS SOMETHING I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER. BUT TO THEN AND UNDER THE UNDER THE BILL AS WRITTEN. ORIGINALLY I WAS WORRIED THAT THAT STARTS TO GIVE TOOLS TO SOMEONE WHO HAS A NAME WHO AS A TRADEMARK WHO IS DOING BUSINESS UNDER A NAME AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO GO AFTER. A SITE THAT IS INCONVENIENT TO THEM AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO IS PERPETRATING A FRAUD. IT CASH OUT ON THAT IT THIS INJECTION ASIAN BECAUSE THEY ARE YOUR AMENDMENTS AND IS RESULT OF YOUR EXPERIENCE IN YOUR PRIOR LAW IT LIFE IS A LAWYER. AREN'T YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT THE PRACTICAL HERE RIGHT. AND WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR BUSINESS IN THE LAW WHERE EVERYBODY LOOKS AT THESE THINGS IN A CERTAIN WAY. YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S CLEARLY A RAT FINK WHO'S OUT THERE TRYING TO GET BUSINESS USING SOMEBODY ELSE'S NAME SPORTS TEAM. SAY THE DODGERS FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT IN ORDER TO GET TICKETS BECAUSE THAT'S OKAY WITH ME OPPLER TEAM. AND SO. AND SO YOU KNOW [inaudible] IT'S ALWAYS. THAT'S A WIN LOSE THE BILL WITH ALL YOU GUYS NORTH BUT IN ANY EVENT WHAT I'VE A LOYAL FAN I'LL GO DOWN TO THE DEATH. BUT IN ANY EVENT -- THE POINT IS THE USE THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S ABOUT FRANK SITE WE KNOW THAT'S THE CASE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GIVE THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PEOPLE GO TO CLASS ACTION STATUS DETERRENT IF YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THESE YOU ARE LOW CODES THAT WAS ARTICULATED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND SOMEBODY GOES THERE WILL YOU'RE NOT GOING. TO GET A JUDGE LOOK AT THAT THAT ISN'T ABOUT TO FROM FRIDAY SO I DO THINK ACTUALLY THAT IS YOU DO THIS I KNOW HOW THE OTHER SIDE CAN ARGUE BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS. BELTS AND SUSPENDERS IT SAYS MY COMPANIES EXEMPTED OR THIS BILLS ONLY FOR MY COMPANY AND THAT THEY CAN READ THINGS THE WAY THEY WANT TO READ IT IS LAWYERS BUT THE REALITY IN PRACTICAL APPLICATION WHAT YOU'VE DONE EXACTLY I THINK. ADDRESSES THIS THIS TENSION THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. IF I COULD JUST SAID I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TENSION HERE -- BECAUSE HE'S A MAN IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW WERE TRYING TO ABSORB THEM -- I HAVE GATHERED THAT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE SPENT A LOT OF TIME REALLY THINKING THIS THROUGH. I WILL. VOTE FOR TO MOVE THIS FOR TODAY BUT I WILL JUST SAY MY HOPE IS THAT THE PARTIES CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS -- AS IT GOES TO THE NEXT STOP IN AND I WILL CERTAINLY RESERVE MY RIGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS -- AT THE NEXT STOP IN AND I HOPE WE GET TO A CLOSE RESOLUTION THANK YOU AND I DO HOPE WE PASSED THIS BUT AND MY COMMITMENT TO THE SENATOR IS. TO TRY AND RESOLVE THIS BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE THE OPPOSITION. COMES OFTEN UNDERSTANDS IS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS GOING AFTER. FRAUDULENT USES THAT ARE UNDERMINING A SPORTS SIDE OF CELEBRITY SIDE. ENTERTAINMENT SITES ABILITY TO DO THEIR BUSINESS ACTUALLY THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO INTERRUPT HERE BUT AS I READ THIS AND HAVING BEEN INVOLVED EARLY ON WITH SO MANY NAMES AND VARIOUS. ACTIONS AROUND TRADEMARK OWNERS TRYING TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO HAS LEGITIMATELY REGISTER DOMAIN NAMES I AM SENSITIVE TO THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF THERE WERE A LOT OF ABUSES AT THAT TIME. AND IN FACT INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE FORCED TO GIVE UP DOMAIN NAMES THAT THEY LEGITIMATE HAVE. UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE COURTS THAT LAW HAD SINCE BEEN CHANGED. IN WAYS THAT GIVE SOME PREFERENCES TO SOMEONE WHO HAS LEGITIMATELY REGISTERED TO A DOMAIN NAME. THAT THAT WAS BENEFICIAL. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO A SITUATION NOW WHERE A TRADEMARK OWNER CAN UNNECESSARILY INTERFERE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS LEGITIMATE PUTTING OUT A DEMAND IT. AND SO IF IF. YOU WANT TO PUT UP A A DOMAIN THAT SAYS DODGERS STOCK. AS A GUIDE FOR AS A SORRY WERE WERE. I THEY OWN THAT ACTUALLY SAID IF THIS SENATOR BROUGHT THAT UP RIGHT THAT SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICIAL. THE THAT DE THE OFFICIAL. TEAM SHOULD BE GOING AFTER BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ABOUT. COLLECTING AND DIVERTING SOMEONE AWAY FROM TICKETS IT'S ABOUT A VALUE STATEMENT THAT SOMEBODY WOULD WANT TODAY. SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT THAT IS WHERE THE FIRST A MEMBER COMES AND WE DON'T WANT TO PREVENT THAT [inaudible] THAT'S A POLITICAL STATEMENT A RIVAL RESTATEMENT BUT NOT NECESSARILY INTERVIEW. INTERFERING WITH THE DODGERS ABILITY TO STIR SELL TICKETS OR THEIR AUTHORIZED AGENTS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND IF WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS. PERFECTLY WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO THREAD AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE STOPPING THE OFFENSES INTENDED. BUT NOT GOING ON BEYOND WHERE WE'RE GONNA NOW SEE THE THAT THIS LAW BE ABLE TO BE USED TO SHUT DOWN DEMANDS THAT HAVE REALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FRAUD. THAT IS CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND I AND I SEE WHY THIS IS SO DIFFICULT TO THREAD BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE CASE IF IF SOMEONE. PERHAPS THE SENATE AUTHOR -- HAD PURCHASED GO DODGERS AND THAT BECAME A WAY TO SELL TICKETS FRAUDULENTLY CORRECT THOSE ARE THE TWO SCENARIOS THAT WERE TRYING TO DISTINGUISH. YES YES AND SO IF THAT GO DODGERS EURO IS BEING USED FRAUDULENTLY WE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO AND STOP THAT. BUT IF THAT'S BEING USED IN A WAY THAT IS. AS I SAY AND RELY AMPLE IN. YEAH EXAMPLE LIKE TO GO IN ALL THE GIANTS GAMES AND BASICALLY. PROTESTERS THE TEAM. NOW YOU LAWSUIT I'D WHAT WOULD BE THE JANITOR PURPOSE YEAH. BUT NOT SELL TICKETS AT YOU KNOW AT INFLATED PATE RIGHT ENOUGH THAT AMOUNTS THAT'S A DISTINCTION WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE HERE. AND ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH WHAT THAT. OPPOSITION AS PROPOSED HERE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO WE DO NOT ONE UNDER MY THAT BUT THAT'S TO ME THE SENSITIVITY. THANK YOU AND AND AND I I AM COMMITTED TO TO CONTINUE TO WORK I I GET THE ISSUE YOU YOU COMMITTEE PUT THESE AMENDMENTS AND I HAVE THIS ALL ALONG I THINK THAT YOUR EXPERTISE AS INFORM THE PROCESS. CAPITA WORK WITH YOU GUYS -- ED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SENSITIVITIES YOU'RE WORKING WITH I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO IT BUT I THINK YOUR POINTS WELL TAKEN IN.

THANK YOU AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL SB TWO EIGHTEEN ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE STATE LAW PROHIBITING EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION. AND ENACT THEIR OWN ANTI DISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING IT'S THE ONLY BODY IN THE STATE AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE THE STATE'S ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. DEPARTMENT RECEIVED OVER. TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND OUR DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS EVERY YEAR BUT VERY FEW OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY -- I FULLY INVESTIGATED. AS WE KNOW EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IS ON THE UP RISE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THIS NATION SPECIALS RELATES AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS. ARE SB TWO EIGHTEEN FEELS TO CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT GAP AND SURE PEOPLE RETURN TO WORK FASTER RECOVER LOST WAGES CONTRIBUTE TO LOCAL ECONOMY AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES -- OUT WITH ME TODAY IN TESTIMONY IS LINDA JONES FROM LA BLOCK OR WORKERS CENTER. AND MY CARILLO -- FROM THE WESTERN CENTER LONG POVERTY IN A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. HI COMMITTEE MY NAME IS. LINDA JONES AND I HAVE WORKED AS A REGISTERED NURSE FOR MORETHAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR I HAVEN'T HAD MANY ON STAFF NURSING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES -- SO MOST OF MY WORK HAS BEEN ASSIGNED BY THE NURSING REGISTRY. REGISTRY NURSES CAN AT ANY TIME BE WRITTEN UP AND PLACED ON A DO NOT RETURNED WITH. A DO NOT RETURN OR DNR MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT RETURN TO THAT MEDICAL FACILITY DUE TO WHATEVER NURSING SUPERVISOR RECEIVE THAT'S ONE THING COMPETENCE PERFORMANCE. OR TROUBLESOME BEHAVIOR. I KNOW THE JOB I KNOW HOW TO BE A NURSING PROFESSIONAL. BEFORE I BECAME AN RN I WAS A CNA FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. SO I KNOW THE D. N. R. S. WERE NEVER RELATED TO MY JOB PERFORMANCE. TO DATE I HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL DISCRIMINATORY THE IN OURS RIGHT UPS THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. NONE OF THEM WILL WARRANTED OR EVEN EXPLAINING. YET AND STILL I CAN NO LONGER WORK AT THESE FACILITIES. ONE STORY THAT REALLY STANDS OUT TO ME WAS BEING THE IN OUR AFTER WORKING FOR HOURS ON A TWELVE HOUR SHIFT. I WAS ONLY A THE ONLY BLACK ARE IN ON THE UNIT AT THAT FACILITY. I REMEMBER WAKING UP WAKING UP EXTRA EARLY THAT MORNING SO I COULD GET MY GRAND KIDS READY FOR SCHOOL BEFORE I HAD TO LEAVE. I DROVE OVER NOW FROM POMONA TO PANORAMA CITY -- THROUGH REST OUT WHAT TRAFFIC ARRIVED ON TIME IMPROPERLY BEGAN MAKING MY ROUNDS. BY NOON I WAS DISMISSED -- THEIR REASON I LEFT MY MEDICAL REPORTS FACED UP ON THE COMPUTER DEATH. THERE ARE NO ALLIES FOR REGISTRY NURSES. THERE IS NO WHERE WE CAN GO TO DISPUTE. THESE CLAIMS. NOT EVEN THE REGISTRIES WE'RE CONTRACTED WITH. CAT TO DEFEND OUR RIGHTS TO WORK -- WITH TRANSPARENCY I'VE FOUGHT THESE DE IN NORTH BY FILE IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. A MATTER OF FACT I FILED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS. A TO FIND SOME JUSTICE AND EVEN FULL INVESTIGATION INTO THE CLAIMS. FOR ME THE FOLLOWING PROCESS WAS NEVER CLEAR EASY BY THE TIME. I WOULD HEAR BACK FROM. MY CLAIMS IT WOULD BE TOO LATE TO PURSUE. A MEANS OF DEATH THIS EVEN WITH A RIGHT TO SUE LETTERS. LAWYERS WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE WRONGS BUT WOULD NEVER AGREE TO TAKE THE CASE. THE WAY OUT THIS PROCESS THAT BECAME VERY ANGRY AT THE SYSTEM ANGRY BECAUSE HERE I GO AGAIN. I HAVE TO RE EVALUATE MY LIFE I'M GOING TO FEED MY FAMILY. PAY MY BILLS THAT ARE ALREADY AT THE TURN OFF STATUS. I HAVE SEEN MANY BLACK BAR ENDS. BECOME BLACKLIST DUE TO THE DNR WRITE UPS. BY MEDICAL FACILITIES THAT EMPLOY A FEW. IF ANY BLACK NURSES. AS A RESULT SOMEONE LATER FOR US TO LEAVE THEIR PROFESSION STRUGGLING TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES I PERSONALLY KNOW A FEW WHO LEFT THE STATE. IN SEARCH OF FAIR UNBIASED EMPLOYMENT. BLACK NURSING PROFESSIONALS IN THE STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST AN UNJUST DISCRIMINATORY SYSTEM THAT FORCED THEM TO BE VULNERABLE. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE SENATE BILL. TWO EIGHTEEN BLACK NURSES IN HONESTLY ALL WORKERS. DESPERATELY NEED BETTER SILVER RIGHTS PROTECTION IN ORDER LEAD IMPERFECTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND I HAVE TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO TOP THAT. AND I JUST SAW WHAT I WANT TO SAY THOUGH -- YOU KNOW AS MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW OUR OUR BRAD AND BUTTER ISSUES UP HERE ARE PUBLIC BENEFITS AND WE WORK ON THEM ALL THE TIME. AND THOSE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE THERE FOR GOOD REASON THAT WHEN SOMEONE HAS TROUBLE. LOSE THEIR JOB THEY THEY LACK EMPLOYMENT -- THOSE ARE THERE TO BE A SAFETY NET FOR OUR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND AND THERE AND WE HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM IN THERE AND IT WORKS REASONABLY EFFECTIVELY. BUT TOO OFTEN WHAT WE SEE IS THAT PEOPLE END UP HAVING TO USE THOSE PUBLIC BENEFITS SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF SITUATIONS LIKE YOU JUST HEARD. PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY AND WORK THEY'RE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE BEING FORCED THEM TO OUR PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS. WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE? THERE SHOULD BE A LEGAL RECOURSE -- UNFORTUNATELY OUR STATE SYSTEM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL THE LAST DECADE OR SO HAS. NOT BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THE JOB THAT IT THAT IT NEEDS TO BE DOING TO PROTECT WORKERS LIKE MS JONES WHEN WITH THE LACK OF THOSE RESOURCES AND AND THE FAILURE OF MANY INVESTIGATIONS BY DE OF THE H.. WE ARE SEEING WORKERS FALL THROUGH THE CRACK AND THEN HAVING TO RELY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE ALL THE TIME -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT REALLY WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS THE SAME BALLOTS THAT WE'VE HAD IN FAIR HOUSING FOR MANY YEARS. MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE LOCAL FAIR HOUSING COMMISSIONS THAT BACK UP AND WORK WITH THE STATE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT MORE PEOPLE GET THE KIND OF PROTECTIONS THEY NEED WHEN THEY'RE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. IN THE HOUSING WORLD AND WE'RE NOW SUGGESTING THAT THAT OUGHT TO BE EXTENDED OUT TO EMPLOYMENT CASES AND FOR THAT REASON WE BELIEVE THAT. SB TWO EIGHTEEN IS REALLY JUST KIND OF A MODICUM OF BASIC DECENCY THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT THAT EMPLOYMENT GETS THE SAME PROTECTION THAT HOUSING DOES. AND WE ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THOSE KIND OF AGENCIES ALSO. WORDS SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THIS. HI GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS MINDY GIRL AND I AND OUR WORK WITH THE LA BLACK WORKERS CENTER WE ARE PROUD SPONSOR OF THE BILL IN SUPPORT AND I'M AVAILABLE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. YOU ON MY HALF THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. THANK YOU RENE BAYARDO ESSAY YOU SEE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE SUPPORT. CAME IN DEAN WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AT POLICY LINK PROUD CO SPONSORS. AND ONE MATHIS WITH UT W. ASKED ME LOCAL. THIRTY NINE THIRTY AND PRATT'S PART. CHUCK I'M REALLY. WITH THE FORTY THREE THREE LA AND FROM SUPPORT OF AS BETWEEN. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- JENNIFER BROWN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE. CLOSED SB -- TWO EIGHTEEN WE FULLY AGREE -- THAT ANYBODY WHO HAS SUFFERED DISCRIMINATION SHOULD HAVE A AT FISH AND AND EASIER UP PROCESS TO GO THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S INVESTIGATED IMPROPERLY ADDRESSED HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT SB TWO EIGHTEEN WON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE. THAT -- PROCESS DUE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH REGARDS TO SUBSTANTIVE INCONSISTENCY IN PROCEDURAL INCONSISTENCY THAT WE CAN SEE MAY ARISE FROM -- THIS PROPOSAL OF MEMBERS OF OUR OF OUR MEMBERS ARE DEFINITELY CONCERNED WITH REGARDS TO THE SUBSTANTIVE INCONSISTENCY IN WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES IS THAT THESE LOCAL AGENCIES. MAY INTERPRET THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED MAY LEAD TO INCONSISTENCIES WITH REGARDS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT QUALIFIES AND CONSTITUTES DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. I WAS -- A PART OF THE US BEFORE NINETY FIVE FOUR NINETY ONE ADVISORY GROUP THAT -- THAT DRAFTED THE REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED -- AND IS THE BASIS FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND ONE OF THOSE -- IT ONE OF THE ISSUES IN THE REPORT THAT IS RAISED IS THE TRAINING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BE CONDUCTED FOR A LOT OF THESE LOCAL AGENCIES AND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING TO BE INVESTIGATING A PROCESSING COMPLAINTS THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CONSISTENCY WITH REGARDS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT -- AND THAT'S NOT A PART OF THIS PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW AS WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LOCALS -- TO ADOPT THEIR OWN DISCRIMINATION LAWS ON WHICH WOULD CREATE INCONSISTENCIES FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION AS TO WHAT QUALIFIES FOR A DISCRIMINATION. AND COULD HAVE A CHALLENGES FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO OPERATES IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS CONSISTENT POLICIES THAT PROTECT ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WHEN YOU HAVE. DIFFERENT -- ORDINANCES WITH REGARDS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES DISCRIMINATION SO WE HAVE CONCERNS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. PROCEDURALLY WERE ALSO CONCERNED AS HIGHLIGHTED BY SOME OF THE POINTS REASONING ANALYSIS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IT IS A SMOOTH PROCESS AND THAT ALL THE AGENCIES ARE WORK TOGETHER -- AND THAT IT IS RESOLVED IN A WAY -- THAT DOESN'T. OBVIOUSLY AT THAT PROTECTS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PURSUING A DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT BUT ALSO PROVIDES NOTICE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND RIGHTS FOR THE EMPLOYER WHO IS IT WHO IS CHALLENGING -- THE CLAIM -- WHICH WE ALSO CAN ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL THAT'S IMPROPER WE HAVE THOSE PROCESSES IN PLACE AND OTHER CONCERNED IS ALSO WITH REGARDS TO VENUE AND WHERE THESE CLAIMS REFILED OBVIOUSLY. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WHERE DISCRIMINATION NECESSARILY OCCURS AND TO HAVE. SOME LOCATION. IT COULD CREATE A VENUE CHALLENGE WITH REGARDS TO VENUE SHOPPING INFORM SHOPPING WITH REGARDS TO WHERE THE CLAIMS ARE BEING PROCESSED AND CLARA. AND AND FILED AND SO WE HAVE -- CONCERNS FROM THAT PROCEDURAL PROCESS AS WELL SO WE ARE CONCERNED -- AND MY FINAL POINT IS -- IF TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EXISTING AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING IS NOT INVESTIGATING THESE IN A AND FISHING MANNER -- WE HAVE A HUGE SURPLUS IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW BUDGETARY A SURPLUS AND SO I HAVEN'T FOUND A REASON AS TO WHY WE CAN'T JUST DEVOTE MORE RESOURCES TO THE EXISTING AGENCY AND AVOID A LOT OF THESE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE INCONSISTENCIES THAT WE'VE RAISED AS CONCERNS. I'M AND HAVE THAT BEING A WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MORE EFFICIENT -- RESOLUTION OF INVESTIGATIONS AND COMPLAINTS FILED WITH THE DMV H. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION -- OF COURSE THAT ENFORCEMENT AGGRESSIVE AN APPROPRIATE ENFORCEMENT UNFAIR AND POINTED IN HOUSING ACT IS IMPORTANT BUT BUSINESSES AND POTENTIAL DEFENDANTS DO NEED CONSISTENCY SO THEY'RE AWARE OF CLEAR RULES AND CAN FOLLOW THEM -- THIS BILL IF ENACTED COULD LEAD TO A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT RULES -- IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS FOR EXAMPLE YOUR DISTRICT STAFF MIGHT HAVE ONE SET OF DISCRIMINATION RULES WHEREAS YOUR CAPITAL STAFF MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER ONE WELL THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO COMPLY WITH FOR LEGISLATORS BUSINESSES WHO OF DIFFERENT. LOCATIONS WOULD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM LOCAL ENFORCEMENT WOULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A PATCH WORK -- A VERY RULES MAKING IT HARDER FOR DEFENDANTS TO COMPLY WHICH WE WANT THEM TO DO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNALED BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THIS FEATURE NORTH. SENATOR I'M JUST PICKING UP I THINK ON A QUESTION THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISED I AM. SO. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR FOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT T. F. EACH DOES NOT HAVE THE REQUISITE CAPACITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS. YOU'RE IN A EXPEDITIOUS MANNER SO WHY WOULD WE CREATE AN OF A PARALLEL PROCESS RATHER THAN JUST INVESTING MORE RESOURCES INDIA V. H. R. IN ORDER TO SERVE OUR EMPLOYEES BETTER I AND TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT WERE IT OCCURRED. PROVIDES A A MORE COMPREHENSIVE I FEEL RESOLUTION AND THE INVESTIGATION VERSUS GIVEN IT TO THE STATE THAT'S CUMBERSOME WE ALL YEAR EVERY IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF OCT. HOW THE STATE IS OVER BURDEN HOW WE'RE SLOW HOW WE'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY NOW WE WANT TO DIRECT MORE MONEY TO A DEPARTMENT THAT IS NOT? DOING THE JOB IT DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY LET THE LOCAL LEVEL DO IT WORK THE DISCRIMINATION HAPPENED WORTH THE VIOLATION HAPPEN I THINK. IT'S NOT CREATING ANY NEW LAWS IT'S FOLLOWING WHAT'S ON THE BOOKS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE AND JUST LIGHTEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTERPRET THOSE SAME LAWS THE SAME WAY ARBITRATOR FOR THE STATE WOULD DO IT. SO THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE THE ARBITRATOR VERSUS THE STATE. SEC IT'S GIVING MORE LOCAL CONTROL. BUT NOT CREATING A NEW PROCESS THE PROCESS IS WHAT'S ON THE BOOKS UNDER FIAT. AND FOLLOWING THOSE RULES AND GUIDELINES FOR DISCRIMINATION THAT HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE NOT. CREATING A NEW SET OF GUIDELINES TO SAY THIS IS DISCRIMINATION THIS IS NOT IT'S CLEARLY DEFINE WHAT WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AS WE'RE JUST ASKING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO INTERPRET THAT. AND SO DO YOU HAVE A DO YOU SHARE ANY OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION RAISED IN TERMS OF THE RISK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE INCONSISTENT AND INTERPRETATION AND AT WHAT CAN WE DO TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS. CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION AND CONSISTENT I GUESS WE CAN EITHER CONCERN ON ALMOST ANYTHING AND WHEN YOU HAVE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES ARE COUNTY GOVERNMENT TO INTERPRET THINGS DIFFERENTLY. BASED ON THE MIND SET OR THE POPULATION THAT THE SERVER BUT I'M NOT FEARFUL THAT IF THE GUIDELINES ARE THERE WHETHER IT'S A FEDERAL LAW STATE LAW OR A LOCAL ORDINANCE I THINK I HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN INTERPRET IT APPROPRIATELY. AND APPLY IT IN A JUST AND FAIR MANNER AND SHOW WHETHER IT'S BEING DONE ON A LOCAL LEVEL OR STAY LOW WHY I'M CONFIDENT THAT. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE IT OFF AGAIN IT DOESN'T PREVENT. AN EMPLOYEE. FROM FILING THIS WITH THE STATE AND IF YOU DO SO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAD -- NOEL INTO INTERVENTION IN IT AT ALL STATE CAN STILL DO IT BUT IT GIVES US THAT EMPLOYEE WHO'S BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. ANOTHER OPTION. AT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THIS MAIENSCHEIN. JUST BRIEFLY KIND OF PICKING UP THERE FOR A SECOND. SO AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT A LITTLE BIT WHAT AND MAYBE A DEMERIT DUMP BUT CURRENTLY THE STATE THE STATE HAS A PROCESS THEY GO THROUGH. ON HEARING THESE SUIT. AND I'M A TAKEN INTO PARTS MAY TAKE IT THE THE INITIAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND THEN AND THEN THE APPEALS PROCESS. TO THE STATE HAS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT MAY FOLLOW ON THESE CLAIMS [inaudible] YES. THIS YOU KNOW SAN DIEGO OR LA OR SAN FRANCISCO TAKING KIND OF THE BARE PARTS BUT EVEN. MAYBE IN A MORE PROBLEMATIC WAY MAYBE SOME OF THE SMALLER. COUNTIES IN THE STATE. COULD DO THAT DIFFERENTLY IS THAT. A FAIR STATEMENT. I AM I MEAN YES I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT SOMEONE MIGHT INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY JUST BASED ON WHAT WE ARE YEAH JUST ARE THERE. HONEST REVIEW OF THE FACTS LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY AGAIN NOT NOT TO SAY BETTER OR WORSE MAY GET IT. MAYBE DO A BETTER BY THE LIMITED TORT. AND THEN SAME WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS IS THE IS THE APPEALS PROPER BUT WELL OKAY HOUSE SEPARATING IS THE APPEALS PROCESS NOW CHANGE [inaudible] NO. EVERYTHING AGAIN IT JUST ALLOWS LOCAL. AGENCY TO DEAL WITH IT WERE THE VIOLATION HAPPEN VERSUS SENATE TO STATE AND IT MIGHT BE BOGGED DOWN FOR MONTHS IF NOT A YEAR BEFORE THEY EVEN LOOK AT IT THIS I JUST THINK THIS GIVES IS A QUICKER RESOLUTION TO A PROBLEM WHETHER IT'S FAVORABLE. FOR THE EMPLOYER OR NOT YOU GET IT RESOLVED A LOT QUICKER I'M. OKAY THANK YOU. IS OUT. WE WE HAVE THIS FOR CERTAIN. VIOLATIONS CRAP LIKE WAGE THEFT FOR EXAMPLE THERE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS THAT CURRENTLY CAN ENFORCE THE STATE LAW. THIS ISN'T A NEW IDEA OKAY. ANYTHING ELSERIGHT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE ALL RIGHT I THINK YOU AND I THINK. YOU THE COMMITTEE FOR THE QUESTIONS AND AS WE'VE HEARD AND I WANT TO THANK MS JONES FOR HER TESTIMONY -- I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH HER TESTIMONY AND IT TOUCH ME PERSONALLY BECAUSE MY MOTHER IS A REGISTERED NURSE. AND AS SHE WOUND DOWN HER CAREER AS A COUNTY NURSE SHE TOOK GONE REGISTRY JOBS IS TO STAY BUSY JUST.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON. NOT QUITE YET AFTERNOON. ALMA. FEEL LIKE A NIGHT ACTIVELY BUT OKAY THINK WE'LL GET THERE I FELT LIKE SAYING GOOD EVENING RIGHT. BASED ON MY MORNING SO FAR AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU CAN CERTAINLY. SHARE THE SENTIMENT -- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU BACK TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR DEVELOPING THE LANGUAGE. SENATE BILL SIX THREE NINE WILL INCREASE IN STRENGTH AND CONSUMER PROTECTION SURROUNDING MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS THAT ARE OFFERED TO PATIENTS BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS. WHILE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES MEDICAL PROVIDERS PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH BASIC INFORMATION CAN STILL CONSUMERS OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH UNDERSTANDING HOW DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISIONS WORK. MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE MARKED WITH THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD OF 0% INTEREST WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT BEFORE. AND WHILE MOST CONSUMERS EXPECT INTEREST TO RISE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD FEW CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS CONTAIN THIS DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISION WHICH CREATES A LITTLE DIFFERENT SCENARIO CASE IN POINT FOR EXAMPLE. LET'S SAY YOU FINANCE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU PAY OFF NINE HUNDRED BY THE END OF THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. BUT UNDER DEFERRED INTEREST ARE YOU CAN BE AT ALL AND ARE HIT WITH INTEREST THAT HAS BEEN ACCUMULATING EACH MONTH DURING THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. THAT IS THE CHALLENGE FOR TRYING TO FIX HERE SO THE SOLUTION WE BELIEVE IT'S SB SIX THREE NINE WHICH ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY DOING THE FOLLOWING. IT WILL PROHIBIT MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM SIGNING PEOPLE UP FOR PRODUCTS WITH DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISIONS. WILL PROHIBIT MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM CHARGING TO MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE SERVICES BEING RENDERED. YOU CAN STILL SIGN UP FOR A CAR THAT INCLUDES DEFERRED INTEREST BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT ONLINE SEPARATE. FROM WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW IN THE DENTIST'S CHAIR WITH IN PAIN IF YOU FOLLOW ME. IT PROHIBITS MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM PRE PHILLY NOT MEDICAL CREDIT CARD APPLICATIONS AND ONLY ALLOW FOR THAT IT'S SUCH APPLICATIONS TO BE FEEL THAT IN THE TREATMENT AREA WHEN THE PATIENT AGREES. IT REQUIRES PROVIDED THAT THAT ACCEPT MEDICARE OUT TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN MEDIC TO MEDICARE PATIENTS WHAT THEY'RE MEDI CAL BENEFITS ACTUALLY COVERS AND DOES NOT COVER. AND IT RE WORDS OF THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THE SERVICES TO A LEVEL THAT IS MORE. USER FRIENDLY AND READABLE. ALL I MY MY OFFICE AND I ARE AWARE OF THE CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION RELATING TO PROVIDING CONSUMERS EQUAL ACCESS THAT INFORMATION TO A VARIETY OF FINANCING OPTIONS. THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTED IN A RANGE BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS IT IS NOT MY INTENTION WITH THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL TO ELIMINATE MEDICAL CREDIT CARD THAT IS NOT WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT CONSUMERS HAVE A APPROPRIATE IN FAIR SHOT AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ARE SIGNING UP. FOR ALL AND UNDERSTANDING HOW INTEREST WILL BE CHARGED I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION COMMITTEE STAFF AND SUPPORTERS TO THE SUMMER BREAK TO FIND A PATH FORWARD. WELL THIRD PARTY FINANCING MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN PATIENTS NEED SERVICES THAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT IMMEDIATELY PAY FOR MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. TODAY I'VE GOT WITH ME JOY DOCTOR WHO REPRESENTS CONSUMERS WITH MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS AT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES. AND CHEN FLORI OF THOSE WHO'VE REPRESENTING THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WHO ARE ARE BILL SPONSORS I ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS TROY DOCTOR AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH CENTRAL CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES. EVERYDAY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CONTACT OUR OFFICE ASKING FOR HELP WITH MEDICAL BILLS THAT CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY. MORE AND MORE OFTEN THEY'RE ASKING FOR HELP WITH DENTAL CARE CHARGE TO MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW OF THEIR STORIES. LAST YEAR I MET AN EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD MEDI CAL RECIPIENT WILL CALL IRENE. SHE WAS TOLD BY THE DENTIST THAT SHE NEEDED MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF TREATMENT AND THAT MEDI CAL WOULD COVER SOME OF THAT. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT SHE COULD MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON THE REST WHICH SHE AGREED TO DO. BELIEVING THAT SHE WOULD BE PAYING THE DENTAL OFFICE DIRECTLY. INSTEAD SHE WAS SIGNED UP FOR A CREDIT CARD WITHOUT HER INFORMED CONSENT CONSENT. THE FIRST BILL SHE RECEIVED REVEALED THAT EVEN THOUGH SHOULD ONLY SO FAR HAD HER TEETH CLEANED FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS HAD BEEN CHARGED TO THE CARD. THE CARD CAME WITH AN EIGHTEEN MONTH DEFERRED INTEREST PLAN BUT IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING INTEREST ON THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL BALANCE. I RAIN WOULD HAVE HAD TO MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF MORE THAN A MAN WILL CALL EDDIE WAS SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE WENT TO THE DENTIST WITH A TOOTHACHE IN ONE OF HIS VERY FEW REMAINING TEETH. AS A MEDICARE RECIPIENT HE WOULD HAVE ALL IT COULD HAVE HAD ALL OF THE TEETH PULLED AND FULL DENTURES PLACED AT NO COST TO HIM. A DIFFERENTPLAN WAS RECOMMENDED AND SINCE EDDIE HAD MEDICARE. MEDICAID NOW AND A FORTY DOLLAR MONTH INSURANCE PLAN THROUGH THE HE AGREED TO PROCEED. AFTER HIS MOUTH WAS KNOWN TO EDDIE WAS HANDED WHAT HE WAS TOLD WERE INSURANCE PAPERS TO SIGN. A MONTH LATER HE RECEIVED A DENTAL CREDIT CARD AND A BILL FOR MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT TURNED OUT HIS PRIMARY DENTAL INSURER HAD REFUSED TO PAY ANYTHING BECAUSE NO PRE APPROVED TREATMENT PLAN WAS FILED. AND NO CLAIM HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO MEDI CAL AT ALL. AND IT'S NOT JUST SENIORS A WOMAN WILL CALL LARA EARNED ONLY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH PROVIDING IN HOME DAYCARE. AFTER SHE WAS TOLD SHE NEEDED EXTENSIVE DENTAL WORK LARA TOLD THE DENTIST SHE COULDN'T AFFORD IT AND THEY'D HAVE TO BILL MEDICARE. WHEN THE DENTIST SAID THAT MEDI CAL WOULDN'T COVER THE TREATMENT SHE NEEDED LARA AGREED TO SIGN UP FOR A MEDICAL CREDIT CARD? THE FIRST BILL CAME WITH A MONTHLY PAYMENT DEMAND OF ALMOST THE CHECK SURELY REVEALED HER VERY LOW INCOME BUT SHE WAS APPROVED ANYWAY WITHOUT ANY DISCLOSURE OF THE MATH INVOLVED. IF SB SIX THIRTY NINE WERE LAW IRENE WOULDN'T BE BILLED FOR TREATMENT SHE HADN'T RECEIVED OR HAVE TO PAY EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF INTEREST ON THE ORIGINAL BALANCE REGARDLESS OF WHAT WAS LEFT ON THE CARD BY THEN. EDDIE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THE DENTED CAL WOULD COVER ALL THE TREATMENT HE NEEDED AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ASKED TO UNKNOWINGLY SIGN UP FOR A CREDIT CARD WELL HE WAS ALREADY IN THE TREATMENT CHAIR. LARA WOULD HAVE BEEN FULLY INFORMED WHAT THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT CARD WORK BEFORE SHE SIGNED UP FOR IT. ON A PERSONAL NOTE I KNOW THESE CARS CAN BE USEFUL BECAUSE I HAVE. ONE BUT I KNOW WHAT MY DENTAL INSURANCE COVERS I HAVE AN INCOME THAT SUPPORTS FOR PAYING THE BALANCE AS BEFORE DEFERRED INTEREST BECOMES A PROBLEM. AND I OPENED THE ACCOUNT FULLY AWARE OF THE TERMS. LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE THESE ADVANTAGES AND WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO KEEP THEM FROM FALLING INTO TRAPS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE NO ESCAPE. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHEN FLOOR IN BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE'RE PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHICH WE BRING AFTER HEARING A NUMBER OF STORIES FROM AROUND THE STATE AND I'M REALLY JUST HERE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COME FOR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. RONALD COLMAN ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OUR DISCUSS THE WHOLE THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT. DANIEL **** CANTO KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION IN SUPPORT. A GOOD MORNING BRANDON SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY HER WITH A NEUTRAL POSITION JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS WE I'M REALLY APPRECIATE THE CENTERS FOCUS ON CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AND WE'VE BEEN PLEASED TO BE VERY ENGAGE ALTHOUGH WE ARE CURRENTLY NEUTRAL I'M ON WORK ON THIS BILL INCLUDING -- A LOT OF THINGS IN THE BILL THEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE REALLY EGREGIOUS BEHAVIORS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THINK THAT TWO THINGS THAT I WOULD COMMENT ON IS THAT A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES THAT OF AN REYES REALLY LEAD BACK TO THE FACT THAT MEDI CAL. DOESN'T REALLY COVER EVERYTHING THAT IT SHOULD AND THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES EVEN THOUGH ADULT BENEFITS HAVE BEEN RECENTLY RESTORED WE'RE DOESN'T REALLY COVER WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT NEED UP TO THE STANDARD OF CARE WHICH WHICH INVOLVES SOME GAPS IN SO. AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF CONCERN WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEDICAL DON'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ALSO HAVE DONE A DENTAL COVERAGE. THING THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO FIX THOSE SITUATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE WORK BEING DONE IN THIS BILL. AND ON AROUND THE DEFERRED INTEREST -- WELL THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD THINGS IN THE BILL INCLUDING THAT YOU KNOW SO. NOT A LONG PROVIDERS TO SET SOMEONE UP FOR DEFERRED INTEREST WHICH I THINK IS THE RESULT OF A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN -- AT THAT EXAMPLES THE PROVIDED. IT DOESN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING TO IT IT EDUCATE CONSUMERS ON DEFERRED INTEREST THEY CAN STILL ACCESS IT IT'S THE MOST COMMON FINANCING PRODUCT THAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WITH CAN THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED. AND USED IN MEDICAL OFFICES SO SHOULD THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY EITHER IN THIS BILL OUR FUTURE LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THAT -- EXPLANATION OF THE TRANSPARENCY CA WOULD APPRECIATE BEING INVOLVED IN THAT AND LOOK FOR WORKING ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEN DENNIS ARE OPPOSITION. AS THE OPPOSITION COMES FOR IF I COULD JUST SAY WITH REGARD TO A CD A BEAN -- MITCHELL. I DON'T I COMPLETELY AGREED IT WAS THIS BODY THAT VOTED NUMBER OF YEARS AGO TO IN DENTAL CALLIN SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE AWARE. THE FOCUS OF THE BILL OF MAKING SURE THAT THE CONSUMERS DO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE MEDI CAL COVERS WE HEARD SOME EXAMPLES WHERE THAT WAS NOT MAKE CLEAR. TO THE DENTAL PATIENTS SO I DON'T CHALLENGE WHAT WAS SAID -- IT. HAD FROM A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS THE DENTAL CAL WAS NOT A COPY OF THE SYSTEM A GOOD MANY OF YOUR DENTAL CAL WENT AWAY BUT THE POINT IS MAKING SURE. THAT THE PATIENT VERTICALLY AT THE POINT IN TIME OF A SERVICE NEEDED TO BE DONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY'RE MEDI CAL DOES COVER THANK YOU. OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MR. MR I GUESS THE MORNING. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SENATOR -- ALEX FELONIES FELONIES GROUP -- REPRESENTING ALLIANCE DATA WHICH IS AN ISSUER OF HEALTH CARE CREDIT CARDS -- ALTHOUGH THE BILL DOES MAKE IMPORTANT -- CONSUMER UP FIXES RESPECT AS THEY WERE LAID OUT HERE SOME OF THE ANECDOTES -- BY THE BY THE SPONSORS IT'S STILL DISCRIMINATES AGAINST DEFERRED INTEREST -- DEFERRED INTEREST IS. USED BY SO MANY PEOPLE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT PROBABLY ABOUT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM PROP IF USED IT. FOR PURCHASES FOR THINGS WHETHER IT BE HEALTH CARE OR OTHER RETAIL PURCHASES BUT HAS 80% PAY BACK RATE AND IS A QUITE A VERY POPULAR PRODUCT -- AND PAID BACK WITHIN THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD. FORTUNE THE BILL TIPS THE SCALES. AGAINST THIS PRODUCT BY MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT -- TO OBTAIN AND USE IT FOR PAIN FOR HEALTH HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- CAN A BIT BREAKS THE EXISTING DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO PAYING. FOR A HEALTH CARE PROCEDURES OF CURRENTLY. THE PROVIDER DOES HELP YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS -- BUT HAVE YOUR INFORMATION THEY'RE READY SO IT KIND OF MAKES IT MORE OF A SEAMLESS. TYPE OF TRANSACTION THE WAY THE BILL'S WRITTEN NOW IT'S ACTUALLY JUST SAYS THAT -- WE WILL HELP YOU WITH YOUR FINANCING BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE DEFERRED INTEREST YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO ON YOUR OWN. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SIGN UP ON YOUR OWN GET ALL THE INFORMATION ON YOUR OWN. AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE TO COME BACK TO US AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THEM SEE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY HELP PAY. FOR THE PROCEDURE THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED -- WILL BE THAT'S HELPFUL -- SUCH WITH THE PRODUCT OF VERY POPULAR -- BUT THINK WHAT MAYBE MORE NECESSARY AND WOULD BE HELPFUL IS THAT IF THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. TO THE CONSUMER THE PATIENT AT THE TIME IN WHICH THEY WANT TO RECEIVE. AN EXTENSION OF CREDIT. AND PROVIDE THEM A CHOICE. CHOICE OF DEFERRED INTEREST OR NON DEFERRED INTEREST. AND MAYBE DO A SIDE BY SIDE TYPE OF EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOUR COSTS WOULD BE WHAT YOUR TOTAL CREDIT WOULD BE SOMETHING A LINE. ALONG THE LINES OF WHICH QUITE UNDER THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT WERE WOULD SAY LOOK THIS THIS IS AMOUNT OF CREDIT OR TAKEN OUT THIS IS SUCH A WILL BE YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND THAT'S WHICH WOULD -- AT THE END OF THE PERIOD SO LEAST THE PATIENT WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION SAY. I DON'T THINK THE DEFERRED INTEREST WORKS IN MY BUDGET I'M GOING TO GO WITH A NON DEFERRED INTEREST PRODUCT OR VICE VERSA. BELIEVE PROVIDE THEM THAT INFORMATION GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME TO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL TO THEM. BUT DON'T. SAY ONE IS GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE FROM US AS A PROVIDER AND NO ONE WILL BE ACCEPTABLE BUT YOU HAVE TO GO ON YOUR OWN TO GET IT AND THEN COME BACK LATER. ON WE DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL WE DO THINK THOUGH THAT -- BUT THIS IMPORTANT JUST TO PROVIDE THEM THAT INFORMATION -- AND SOLD BUT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR MITCHELL STAFF WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE SPONSOR. AND WITH HER STAFF AND WE'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO WORK OVER THE SUMMER BREAK TO SEE IF WE CAN RID OF REACH SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION. ON THIS ISSUE BUT AT THIS POINT WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED THE LAST THANK YOU THAT'S LAST WITNESS MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT GOVERNOR MAP CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION CERTAINLY THOSE EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES. DON'T SERVE OUR MEMBERS WELL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ABUSE THE PRODUCT THE PROCESS AND THE PRODUCTS SHOULD BE STOPPED. ON THIS IS ABOUT STRIKING A BALANCE WE HAD A CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE PROPONENTS. WE HOPE WE CAN WORK IT OUT TO ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCT -- REMAINS AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS SO THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS OVER THE BREAK IN AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN REACH AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS COMMINGLED WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED AS WELL THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEN ENTERING A BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WAS KILEY. I JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPOSITION SO IN PRACTICE WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS SOMEONE IS -- SEEKING TREATMENT THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT COVERED ON A FINANCING OPTION IT'S PRESENTED TO THEM RIGHT THEN AND THERE AND THEY HAVE TO SIGN IT HOW DOES IT USUALLY WORK FROM IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE PROVIDERS BECAUSE OF REPRESENT THE THE ISSUER OF THE CREDIT. CARD FOR I UNDERSTAND THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT IF TOLD THIS IS WHICH TREATMENTS GOING TO BE IN THIS WITH THE COST GOING TO BE AN ALL BY THE WAY. IT BEEN A FEW COULD AFFORD IT AND YOU NEED TO RECEIVE FINANCING THEM VIA WE'RE OFFERING YOU -- THIS PARTICULAR FINANCINGPRODUCT WHICH DEFERRED INTEREST -- AND THEN ACROSS THE ABYSS PRESUMING THEY'RE OFFERING THE TELLING YOU EXACTLY. WHAT WHAT IT ENTAILS AND WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SO -- WITH THAT PARTICULAR PART IS NOT BEING EXPRESSED TO THE TO THE PATIENT THE NOTHING THAT'S THE PART WHERE THE BILL NEEDS TO KIND OF FILL THAT GAP WELL YOU SAID THAT THAT YOU'D BE OKAY IF THEY'RE PRESENTED WITH THE CHOICE BUT IN PRACTICE RIGHT NOW ARE. CONSUMERS USUALLY PRESENT WITH THAT CHOICE OR IS A STANDARD TO JUST HAVE THAT DEFERRED I THINK I I THINK IT'S PROBABLY JUST. ONE PARTICULAR PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE OFFERING IT'S A WHY ARE A WISE DEFERRED INTERESTS KIND OF THE STANDARD WHY IS IT WHY IS IT USED AT ALL WHAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF RESPECTIVELY APPLIANCE I THINK IF IT'S WITHIN PEOPLE'S BUDGETS AND AN EFFECT. IF THEY THINK THEY CAN ACTUALLY FIT WITHIN THEIR BUDGET THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH A PRODUCT IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO PAY NO INTEREST. AND SO IT'S IT'S A VERY -- APPEALING PRODUCT WHEN LIKE HECK IF I IF I COULD PAY THIS BACK IN TWELVE MONTHS OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS I PAY NO INTEREST. THE COULD DIVIDE WHATEVER THE BALANCES OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND PAY IT ALL BACK. SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY OF TYSON PRODUCT AND I SEE THE AD DID THE AUTHOR ANY OTHER SCORES RESPOND. TO POLICE. AM I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS REALLY WHAT'S BEING OFFERED IS ONE OPTION -- AND SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW IF THE OPPONENTS ARE INTERESTED IN OFFERING MORE THAN ONE OPTION AND EXPLAINING THINGS CLEARLY IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEM THEN WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE HERE TODAY. BUT WITH DEFERRED INTEREST WHAT THE ISSUE IS SO FOR A MIDDLE OR UPPER CLASS INCOME PERSON WHO COULD REASONABLY PAY IT OFF WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS. IT IS A GREAT DEAL IT'S 0% INTEREST BUT IF YOU KNOW AT THE OUTSET THE PERSON'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PAY THAT OFF. IT'S A WORSE DEAL BECAUSE YOU ARE PAYING AND THESE ARE RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY SIX AND 28% INTEREST FOR THE ENTIRE TIME AND THAT YOU KNOW ONCE YOU GO OVER THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD YOU'VE BEEN GARNERING THAT INTEREST THE ENTIRE TIME -- SO FOR PEOPLE WHO CONCEIVABLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY IT OFF NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT TOLD CLEARLY HOW THE INTEREST IS WORKING -- THERE ALSO IN A MUCH WORSE POSITION THAN IF THEY HAD TAKEN A LOWER FIXED RATE CARD. AND I THINK I WOULD BE SAD -- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF YOU BUT WHEN I GO TO THE DENTIST -- I'VE NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE WITH MY DENTIST OR ANYONE IN THIS OFFICE WHO IGNORE SHOULD I THINK WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE SKILLED. AT WALKING THROUGH. ALL OF THE ELEMENTS AS WAS SUGGESTED IN ME APPLY FOR CREDIT AND YOU KNOW. WHILE WHEN THE DO FLOSS DAILY AND GO TWICE A YEAR OUR DENTAL EXPERIENCES CAN BE POSITIVE ONES AND WHEN THEY AREN'T THAT'S THE LEAST APPROPRIATE TIME TO BE IN THE CHAIR IN PAIN. TRYING TO NEGOTIATE AND FIGURE THIS OUT AND SO PART OF WHAT WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DO IN EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE BILL. IS BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE THAT CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE DON'T TALK TO ME WHEN I'M ALREADY INTO SEDATION IN THE CHAIR HAVE RECEIVED BAD NEWS ABOUT WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IN PAIN. AND NOW YOU EXPECT ME TO FULLY COMPREHEND IN EXILE AND SIGN. DOCUMENTATION ON THAT WILL ENCUMBER ME FINANCIALLY IN THE FUTURE AND SO IT REALLY IS TRYING TO CREATE THIS BALANCE WE WANT THE PRODUCT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD. TEN TWELVE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DENTAL BILLS BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT THEM TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE Là [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SO THANK YOU SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON IS AN AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT. WE WANT TO TRY AND MAKE SURE AT THE END WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE. BUT LOOKING AT THE VALUE OF OUR CLOTHING AROUND HERE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ALL REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION OF BEING. IN A POSITION OF NOT NECESSARILY BEING OF THE PAY SOMETHING OFF WITHIN CERTAIN TIME LINES AND THE THOUGHT OF BEING OFFERED A FINANCIAL PRODUCT. WHEN YOU'RE IN AN OFFICE SURROUNDED BY VERY SHARP THINGS THAT MAY END UP IN YOUR MOUTH? IS CHEST ASTONISHING. BUT ALSO. THE THING THAT. THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DRAWING A DISTINCTION HERE. IS WHO PROVIDING THE PRODUCT AND WHEN THE DENTAL OFFICE LOOKS TO A AN UNSOPHISTICATED ANSWER CA CONSUMER LIKE THEY'RE THE ONES PROVIDING UP THE THE FINANCING. THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION BECAUSE THAT THEY THINK THEIR RELATIONSHIP FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THEIR MEDICAL PROVIDER RATHER THAN THE FINANCIAL PROVIDER. SO WHEN THINGS THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO A WE TRY TO DO WITH THE AMENDMENTS IS SEPARATE THAT TRANSACTION. IN A WAY THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR WHO'S PROVIDING THE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES WHOSE PROVIDING THE MEDICAL SERVICES. AND NOT CONFLATING THOSE TWO I I THINK PROBABLY ALL OF US WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT GOING INTO A DENTAL OFFICE. BUT NOT ALL THE CONSUMERS DO. SO I THINK THERE'S POTENTIALLY SOME GROUND TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND AS WE HAD WORK THROUGH THIS. THE STAFF IN WITHOUT HIS OFFICE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS. IT PROVIDING SO FOR ME PROVIDING THAT CLARITY OF WHO'S PROVIDING WHICH SERVICE. GIVING THE CONSUMER ADEQUATE. OPTIONS AND NOTICE OF THOSE OPTIONS SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR ENTRY INTO AND CAN SEE THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THINK THEY'LL BE WILLING TO PAY. THOSE OF THE SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT I THINK WE'RE WORKING ON WE DO HAVE SOME TIME FORTUNATELY TO TO SORT THROUGH SOME OF THE THE DETAILS OF THIS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS THIS MOVES I'M HOPING IT GETS OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY. BUT THAT WE ARE A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND AND HOW DOES BASIC. AREAS COVERED SO. SETTER I APPRECIATE THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION I WOULD JUST ADD THIS IN A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT IT DEFERRED INTEREST BUT THERE ARE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE BILL -- WE ARE ASKING THAT MIDDLE SCHOOL PROVIDERS CAN'T CHARGE MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO SERVICES BEING RENDERED YOU GIVE ME AN ENTIRE SERVICE. YOU KNOW PLAN IT MAY TAKE YOU KNOW MONTHS TO COMPLETE ALL THE WORK DONE AND YET I'M BEING CHARGED YOU KNOW UP FRONT OF THE RIGHT THINGS MAY HAPPEN I MAY. CHOOSE NOT TO CONTINUE THE SERVICE WITH THAT PARTICULAR PROVIDE WHATEVER THE CASE THIS OF THIS FRONT CHARGING WE THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR VARIETY OF REASONS IN THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THAT. ALSO THE PRE FILL IT OUT OF MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS THAT GETS INTO THE GRAY AREA IN TERMS OF WHO ARE REALLY HAVE THIS FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PROVIDER -- UP OR THIS THIRD PARTY ENTITY -- AND SO I THINK THAT. ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT MORE WE HOPE TO CONTINUE -- TO TO WORK ON AGAIN WITH THE I. ON PROTECTING THE CONSUMER. BOTH BY MAKING SURE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE WHEN THEY NEED IT AND THAT IT'S A SERVICE THAT THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I NEED A MOTION MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU IS THERE SECONDS. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I CHAU CHIU GONZALEZ. HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS IRIS. NEED TO MORE VOTES WILL PUT THAT OUT OF CALL. CHECK YOUR TIME THANK YOU. I SAW SENATE CAREER ALL RIGHT. SB. FOUR SEVENTY TWO WE NEED AGAIN. SEEMS LIKE WE JUST HEARD THIS YES. I'LL I'LL TRY TO SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- I AT FIRST LET ME THINK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BANKING COMMITTEE IT THE FACT THAT IT WAS SCHEDULED BACK TO BACK ONE DAY TO THE NEXT -- MEANT THAT WE NEEDED TO COORDINATE AND WE'VE ENGAGED ON IN A REALLY BROAD BASED -- UP A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT WHETHER IT'S CONSUMER. GROUPS -- ITS THE INDUSTRY ITSELF THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE BEEN PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND SO THEY'VE BEEN REALLY ROBUST AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT THIS WAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF THAT SO REFLECTING THE STAKEHOLDER INPUT WE ACCEPTED SEVERAL AMENDMENTS IN THE BANKING COMMITTEE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WHICH INCLUDED. D. B. O.. OVERSIGHT ON EARNED WAGE ACCESS PROVIDERS INCLUDING REGISTRATION AND DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND CONSUMER COMPLAINT PROCESSES AND TRACKING. RECREATED BETTER WORKER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND TOUGHER IT NON RECOURSE PROVISIONS STRENGTHENING THE BILL'S EXISTING PROHIBITION ON DEBT COLLECTION AND CREDIT REPORT. INCLUDING A THREE YEAR SUNSET TO ENSURE THAT THE STATUTE AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY WORKS AND WE RESISTED EFFORTS TO WEAKEN THE WORKER PROTECTIONS AND THE AMENDMENTS RAISE THE CAP ON THE FEE FROM FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS WHILE MAINTAINING THE ESSENTIAL. 50% CAP ON A CRUDE EARNINGS IT MAY BE ACCESSED. ACCESS DURING A PAY PERIOD. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT CASH FLOW EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THE AMENDMENTS WILL RELAX THE 50% CAP BY ALLOWING IT TO BE EXCEEDED UP TO TWICE EVERY SIX MONTHS AND THAT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION YESTERDAY THAT -- I COULDN'T FIND IT IN THE LANGUAGE AND AND I FINALLY DID -- WE'RE ALSO TAKING AN AUTHOR'S AMENDMENT TO PREVENT LOCATION BASED ADVERTISING OF WAGE BASED OR WORK BASS ADVANCE REFLECTED ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS. SO WITH THAT SB FOUR SEVENTY TO PROVIDE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO REGULATE EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS. THE PROGRAM WILL ALOW CONSUMERS TO ACCESS A PORTION OF THE WAGES THEY HAVE ALREADY EARNED PRIOR TO THEIR SCHEDULED PAYDAY AND HOW THAT SIMPLE PROGRAM WORKS. IS THAT A CONSUMER REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THEIR MONEY. USING AN APP THAT CAN QUICKLY ACCESS UP TO HALF OF THE AMOUNT OF HIS OR HEARD. EARNED UNPAID INCOME DURING A GIVEN PAY PERIOD FOR A SINGLE FIXED FEE. THIS FEE IS A NONRECURRING FEE AND ONLY PAID IF AND WHEN A CONSUMER CHOOSES TO USE THE PROGRAM. AND THE FEE IS LESS THAN A TEMPLE TYPICAL BANK OVERDRAFT FEE OR LATE FEE. WITH A FEW SCREEN TAPPED USER USER'S HAVE INSTANT ACCESS TO THEIR ALREADY AND EARNED. ALREADY EARNED UNPAID WAGES. WHETHER IT'S TO COVER AN UNEXPECTED COST FOR JESS TO AVOID A LATE -- OVERDRAFT FEE SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST NEED AND A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY. BY CREATING A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS WE CAN PROVIDE A SAFE WAY FOR CONSUMERS TO GET THEIR MONEY. WHEN THEY NEED IT? IT IS A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO USE THAT COMES WITH CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY. THE PROTECTIONS IN SB FOUR SEVENTY TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE HELD HARMLESS IT'S NOT A LOAN AND USERS CANNOT DEFAULT AND THERE IS NO COMPOUNDING INTEREST THERE IS NO DEBT CREATED FOR CONSUMER ACCESSING THE EARNED ON PAID INCOME. THERE IS NO INTEREST CHARGED. THERE THESE. THERE IS NO RECOURSE AND NO LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF A NON PAYMENT AND THERE'S NO REPORTING OF NON PAYMENT TO A CREDIT BUREAU. SO -- IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE WAYS FOR FOLKS TO GET THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED THEN WE MUST CONTINUE TO HAVE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS WHICH I AM COMMITTED TO SELL -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY IN SUPPORT IS DOWN QUAN WHO MOST RECENTLY SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS SENIOR ADVISER TO THE DIRECT TO DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY. AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND I JAZZ ANWAR C. O. O. OF PAY ACTIVE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DAN CALL. I THE VICE DESTRUCTIVE INTO COMPANIES INCLUDING PASSIVE I MOST RECENTLY SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS SENIOR ADVISER TO DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY. AND THE CFPB WHERE I LEVEES FINK OFFICE ONE OF MY OR MY OFFICE IS A KEY ACHIEVEMENTS WAS TO FACILITATE EARNED INCOME ACCESS OR EIA. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT DISRUPTS SHORT TERM HI BECAUSE CREDIT PRODUCTS. SEE IF YOU BE CLOSELY EXAMINE THE AYE PROGRAMS AND CONCLUDED THAT YEAH A IS A CONSUMER FRIENDLY INNOVATION. AS A RESULT IN HIS THE FINAL PAY THE RULE RELEASING LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CFPB CREDIT SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE RESPONSIBLE III MODELS. THOSE EXEMPTIONS REQUIRE YEAH I PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE MEANINGFUL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS WERE NOT PREDATORY. AND THE SENATOR CABALLERO HAS INCORPORATED A MENACE SUCH CAR WHEELS IN HER BILL. A FEW KEY POINTS ON WHAT YEAH I IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT. AT THIS BILL RECOGNIZES YEAH I A IS NOT CREDIT. AS EVIDENCED BY THE CFPB DECISION TO EXEMPT EIA FROM THE ABILITY TO REPAIR REQUIREMENTS IN THE FINAL PAY THE RULE. NO FUTURE WAGES ARE IMPLICATED NOTE THAT OBLIGATION IS CREATED NO INTEREST IS CHARGED NO COLLATERAL OR SECURITY INTEREST IS TAKEN FROM THE EMPLOYEE. THE CONSUMER WHEN PLAYER NOW. YEAH I IT IS A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE. THE BILL IMPOSES A STRICT FIFTEEN DOLLAR MONTHLY FEE CAP WHICH MAKES THESE PROGRAMS FAR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN PAYDAY LOANS. LATE FEES OR BANK OVERDRAFT FEES. YEAH A IS BY ITS VERY STRUCTURE A FAR LESS RISKY ALTERNATIVE FIRST BECAUSE NOTE THAT IS CREATED. THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT ALL WITHIN A CREATED ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDENS FOR THEMSELVES SECOND. THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT YOU GUYS SHOULD BE COMPLETELY NON RECOURSE. IF THE CONSUMER DOES NOT REIMBURSE THE PROVIDER THE CONSUMER IS HELD COMPLETELY HARMLESS. THIRD THIS BILL PROVIDES SENSIBLE GHARIALS BY CAPPING THE AMOUNT THE CONSUMER CAN ACCESS EACH PAY PERIOD. THIS INSURED THE WORKERS WILL ALWAYS HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE ON ACTUAL PAYDAY TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. FINALLY THIS BILL AS AMENDED NOT ONLY CONTAINS A PRIOR RIGHT PRIVATE RIGHT ACTION TO ENSURE THE EIA PROVIDERS. HERE TO THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND COMPLY WITH ALL REQUIRED SAFEGUARDS BUT ALSO PROVIDES WITH DB O. REGISTRATION OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATURE HAS A HAS A RICH HISTORY OF CONSUMER AND WORKER PROTECTION. THE MAJORITY OF A WORKERS LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK THEY DESERVE TIMELY SAFE AND AFFORDABLE SMALL DOLLAR FINANCIAL OPTIONS. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SUPPORT. I EXTEND MY HEART MY HEARTFELT THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MS EAGLES I WANT CEO OF ACTIVE AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU BEST WITH US PLEASE. IT DOESN'T MORE PROUD SPONSOR OF P. ACTIVE. BE ACTIVE IN THE BOAT SPONSORED OFFICE BEFORE SEVEN TWO AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT HE LIKES BEACON SCORE COME FORWARD AND GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRISTMAS OUR BEHALF OF EVEN RESPONSIBLE FINANCE. IN SUPPORT OF THE THE MEASURE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS STRONG LEADERSHIP -- IN THIS ISSUE ALSO APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AND AND WORK AND TIME THAT YOU'RE COMMITTEES CONSULTANT HAS SPENT ON THIS AS WELL AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY BANKING COMMITTEES CONSULTANT -- WE HAVE A COUPLE ISSUES WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE MECHANICS OF THE BILL THAT WE STILL LIKE TO WORK THROUGH. IN THE COMING WEEKS AND LOOK FOR TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. PRICING NONE AS THEIR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MUCH TIGHTER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. BUT DID WANT EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE STRONG WORKER PROTECTION LANGUAGE THAT SENATE -- ESPECIALLY AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED -- WE DO SEE THIS AS A FAR LESS RISKY AND FAR MORE RESPONSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO PAYDAY LENDING AND IS SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN WE'VE BEEN A PART OF SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. AND DO HAVE TWO REMAINING ISSUES THAT -- WE'RE WATCHING BOTH REVOLVE AROUND WORKER PRIVACY GENERALLY SPECIFICALLY WE'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS PERSONAL DATA ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THEIR FINANCES THEIR GEOLOCATION AREN'T. SOLD OFF TO THIRD PARTIES AND IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE PROPOSED TO BE TAKEN IN THE BILL THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THAT. OR KIND OF NEW TO THE ISSUE AND SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE DOES WHAT WE THINK IT DOES AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE MAKE SURE THAT. EMPLOYERS AREN'T AWARE OF WHEN WORKERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM HOW MUCH MONEY THEY TOOK OUT THINGS LIKE THAT. JUST THE SAME WAY THAT A WORKER WOULDN'T WANT THEIR EMPLOYER TO KNOW THAT THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A PAYDAY LOAN OR WERE OTHERWISE FACING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES BUT OTHER THAN THAT AGAIN WE DO THINK THIS CONCEPT MAKES SENSE AND TO SEE IS FAR PREFERABLE TO PAYDAY LENDING AND LOOK FORWARD. TO REMAINING IN THE CONVERSATION THANKS THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SIGNALED A BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS KALRA. THANK YOU -- MISS CHATTING WE'RE ALL LEARNING A LOT ABOUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND I REALLY WANT. TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- AS WELL AS THE THE CHAIR AND AS WELL AS CHARLIE MONNING YOUR STAFF. OPPORTUNITY MINUTES NOT A WORK ON THIS IN A VERY SHORT ORDER -- AND OFTENTIMES SPECIALLY BEING IN SILICON VALLEY I HEARD THE WORD DESTRUCTIVE ALL THE TIME. THE USUALLY -- IS IS -- ARE SHORT OF THAT I THINK IN THIS CASE. WITH THIS COULD BEEN TECH DESTRUCTION I THINK IT REALLY IS A SELECTIVE IN A WAY THAT CAN THAT IS VERY GOOD. BUT IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE SURE IT STAYS THAT WAY AND DOESN'T BECOME A WHOLE NEW BE SO TO SPEAK LIKE THE PREDATORY LENDING. INDUSTRY BECAME IT DIDN'T. THE THAT INITIALLY DIDN'T START THAT WAY IT BECAME THAT WAY AND SO I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN REGULATIONS FROM DAY. ONE SO THAT THIS PRACTICE COULD BE MONITORED VERY CLOSELY A BY A BY US AS IT SHOULD BE -- THAT WORKERS ARE PROTECTED. I THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MONEY THAT THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED. AND IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE THAT STILL ALLOWS FOR COMPANIES -- MEANT TO BE ABLE TO UP YOU'LL HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL THAT WORKS FOR THEM BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO US PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THE WORKERS. AND YOU KNOW BUT EVEN AS YOU KNOW OVER THE YEARS AS A AS I'VE BEEN PERSONALLY OF A YOU KNOW A WORKING IN A WAY. TO TELL LIMIT PREDATORY LENDING AND NOW WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF DOING SOMETHING I THINK A MONUMENTAL -- IN IN THE STATE TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- THERE DOES NEED TO BE ALTERNATIVES AND I THE NASA BUT EVERYONE IS AGREED WITH. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE AND I THINK THE MANY AMENDMENTS. DO MAKE IT BETTER AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR REALLY BEING ENGAGED WITH BOTH COMMITTEES AGAIN IN VERY SHORT ORDER. I HAD TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- AND AND I LOOK FORWARD -- TO THE THE REPORT AS IT APPROACHES SUNSET BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE GOOD INTENTIONS ARE MAINTAINED AND KEPT UP. AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE NEED TWEAKS OR CHANGES TO PROTECT THE WORKERS AND CONSUMERS -- THAT THAT COULD BE DONE AND SO THAT THIS IS A GOOD AGAIN I THINK THIS REALLY PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY. OF A WITH THE WITH A THREE YEAR A SUNSET BUT A REAL MEANINGFUL SUNSET BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING BRAND NEW -- THAT WERE DELVING INTO AT THINGS AND REQUIRE A LOT OF REALLY CLOSE STUDY AND SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE OTHER IS OUR MOTION. I LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT SO MANY HAVE DONE. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SO SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THERE COUPLE DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS THAT ARE OUT THERE ONE STRUCK TO CONSUMER AND ONE IS THROUGH AN EMPLOYER. AND EACH REPRESENTS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ISSUES WERE REGULATING OF IN THE SAME AND ONE THINGS WE MAY FIND OUT IS. THOSE TWO MODELS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS. WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO I THINK REALLY LOOK AT HOW. THIS INDUSTRY DEVELOPS HOW IT GETS USE WHAT THE THE WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE POTENTIALLY ON CONSUMERS THROUGH THIS I I THINK IT IS INTERESTING. THIS IS MONEY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN EARNED AND IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTACTS WHERE THAT. PROVIDERS WORKING WITH AN EMPLOYER THINK THAT'S A LOT EASIER TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER. A LITTLE BIT LESS SO AND I THINK THAT PRESENTS SOME RISK SO WERE ON AN INTERESTING JOURNEY HERE CENTER THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT US ON BUT I THINK IT'S VERY PRODUCTIVE AND AND SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL BE. BE ABLE TO TRACK PRETTY CLOSELY TURNED IN THEIR POCKETS AND THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING. I THINK IT ALSO RAISES THE QUESTION AND TALKING WITH A NUMBER MEMBERS ABOUT THIS. THE WHOLE PACE SCENARIO THAT WE GET PAID MONTHLY OR GET PAID WEEKLY THAT MAY BE A THING OF THE PAST AT AT SOME POINT. IS WHY NOT BE ABLE TO BE PAID. SORT OF AS AS WORK GETS DONE THOSE WHO WITH MODERN TOOLS THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S VIABLE BUT IN THE MEANTIME -- THIS IS A VERY. INTERESTING PROCESS INTERESTING BILL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. FOR ALL RIGHT WITHOUT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP MISTER CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS. FOR A GOOD DISCUSSION -- I'M -- WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE LABOR FEDERATION ARE ISSUES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL AND IT'S IT'S VETS LANGUISHING LANGUAGE ISSUES AND SO WE JUST COULDN'T GET IT BACK FROM.

PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN -- LET ME BEGIN -- KEPLER FOR ON BEHALF OF SENATOR ATKINS. LET ME BEGIN BY. THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO -- YESTERDAY IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE THE CHAIRMAN RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. PROVISIONS AND CENTER ACTIONS WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT YOU WORK WITH YOU ON THAT ISSUE I THINK THERE. ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT ARE VALID ABOUT THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN THE BILL. AND THE SENATOR ASKED ME TO CONVEY TO YOU THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SIT WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND TRY TO WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES AS A BILL. WAS FORTUNATE COMMITTEE ADVANCE THE BILL SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT -- FIRST OF ALL -- WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL IN CHIEF -- THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY IS INTENDED -- TO INSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS THAT ARE IN PLACE AND HAVE BEEN IN PLACE CONTINUE TO STAY IN PLACE DESPITE ACTIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO ROLL THOSE BACK -- THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE WELL AWARE OF ACTIONS IN WASHINGTON DC THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD -- TO WE CAN OUR CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND OTHER STANDARDS AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS ESSENTIALLY TO MAKE ENFORCEABLE AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW THOSE FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS THOSE BASIC STANDARDS WHICH IN MOST CASES. HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR MANY DECADES AND BUSINESSES -- INDUSTRIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH. FOR MANY YEARS SO THE BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO CREATE NEW REGULATORY BURDENS BUT RATHER TO KEEP IN PLACE. THOSE STANDARDS THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY WITH RESPECT CALIFORNIA'S -- AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY LAWS. THE BILL HAS A LONG LIST OF SUPPORTERS AND THE PRO TEM WOULD REQUEST AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THOSE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON TO CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATE POLL I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL -- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE THAT SB ONE CREATES A FRAMEWORK FOR STATE AGENCIES TO REGULARLY ASSESSED THE CHANGES THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING TO WEEKEND AIR. WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE FEDERAL ROLLBACKS REQUIRE ACTION AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE PROTECTIONS REMAIN JUST AS STRONG AS THEY WERE BEFORE THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE. IT DOES NOT CREATE NEW STANDARDS. ABOUT MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE AND ARE NOW BEING WEEKEND. ENSURE STONE I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS YOUR COMMENTS WHICH I ALSO HEARD YESTERDAY IT ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES. ABOUT THE USE OF OUR MERCHANTS HE REGULATIONS IN THE BILL. I'M OF COURSE ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR WE'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE AND I THINK TAKE -- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS HAS RAISED SOME INTERESTING WAYS TO ADDRESS THOSE BUT I DO JUST WANNA -- EXPLAIN THAT THE GOAL OF AUTHORIZING THE USE OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. TO ALLOW STATE AGENCIES TO ACT QUICKLY. SO THAT THERE'S NO GAP IN THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE IF A FEDERAL ROLLBACK OCCURS. AS YOU KNOW REGULAR RULEMAKING CAN TAKE A VERY LONG TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD JUST COMPLETED. A RULE MAKING FOR NEW WETLANDS PROTECTIONS FOR THE STATE. BUT IT TOOK THE MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. SO SB ONE WOULD AVOID THAT LINK THE TIME PERIOD WHEN NO PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE BY ALLOWING AGENCIES FOR A LIMITED TIME UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ONE THIS BILL SUNSETS. TO USE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AN ONLY WHEN THE AGENCY ADOPTS THE BASELINE FEDERAL STANDARDS. WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE WHEN THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO -- FINALLY I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ON ANY FEDERAL ROLLBACKS PUBLISHED BY AN AGENCY BEFORE THEY CAN TAKE EMERGENCY ACTION -- THAT SAID AGAIN I WANT TO ASSURE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE ARE -- CONTINUING TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN -- ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN A WAY THAT IS -- THAT THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME SEAN BOTTLE ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE COMPLIANCE. I'M I JUST WANT TAKE A MINUTE AND ADDRESS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT NGUYEN THIS BILLS PREDECESSORS BE FORTY NINE CAME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON IT WAS A BIG CONTROVERSY AT THE TIME SO WANTED -- TO DISCUSS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON OVER THE SESSION -- AT THE OUTSET I JUST WANNA POINT OUT THAT IT WAS ALWAYS -- BOTH AS BEFORE NINE AND SB ONE THE INTENT TO ONLY -- PRESERVE THE EXISTING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT IS IS CURRENTLY -- IN PLACE IN LAW NEVER WAS IT ON ANYONE'S INTENT TO EXPAND THAT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. SO WHEN THIS BILL -- WAS FIRST INTRODUCED THIS YEAR WE MET REGULARLY WITH WITH THE OPPOSITION -- NUMEROUS MEETINGS TO TO TALK ABOUT -- WHAT MINUTES WE COULD TAKE TO MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO EXPAND THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN ANY TYPE OF WAY -- THOSE THINGS DID RESULT IN -- SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SECTIONS WE ACTUALLY REMOVED -- THE PART RIGHT ACTION IN THE LABOR SECTION OF THE BILL AND WE TIGHTENED UP THE ENVIRONMENTAL PART RIGHT OF ACTION SECTIONS. ON TO ENSURE THAT MINOR MODIFICATIONS -- TO ANY TYPE OF FEDERAL ON TO THE SUIT CITIZENS SUPERVISION -- WHAT IT REALLY TRIGGER BY THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN SB? ONE SO OUT THERE ON YOU KNOW NUMEROUS BACK AND FORTH WITH OPPOSITION. GOING THROUGH VERY VERY TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS -- I'M PLEASED TO SAY WE I THINK WE CAME TO A PLACE. WE'RE BOTH SIDES HAVE AGREED TO TO THOSE SECTIONS WE FEEL LIKE WE TIED ENDED UP -- SO THAT THERE ISN'T ANY -- EXPANSION OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- AND AND MORE PARTLY THAT WE WERE PRESERVING THE THE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT CURRENTLY EXIST -- WITHIN THE LAW SO THAT I'LL ASK FOR IDLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLATES. BILL ALLEY -- ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. I'LL HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER PER SE NEXT ON CALIFORNIA'S SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH YOUR BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU I KNOW NELSON SUPPORTS. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION CAPTION CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ADAM RIGHTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WANT TO CONCUR WITH THAT PROPONENTS WE DID COME TO RESOLUTION ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AFTER. AN EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SO -- THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF GOOD FAITH ON THIS BILL AND AND WERE. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE COME TO A RESOLUTION THE REMAIN TWO ISSUES AND ALL. WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THEM YESTERDAY I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE -- TO THEM TODAY AND TO MR LIPPER'S. TODAY I WANT TO EXPRESS THAT WE WOULD BE -- HOPEFUL TO ENGAGE ALSO THE PROCESS OF HOW TO CRAFT MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR THE ACTUAL PUBLICATION OF RULE MAKING UNDER THIS BILL -- AGAIN WE AS THE OPPOSITION OF NEVER OPPOSE THE INTENT OF SB. ONE OF NOR THE OVERALL OR GENERAL FRAMEWORK. BUT HOW WE FULL THESE COMPLEX FEDERAL -- STANDARD IN THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND WHERE WE PUT THEM I DO BELIEVE REQUIRES. A WHAT WE'VE BEEN PROPOSING WHICH IS EMERGING ROLE MAKING SUBJECT TO THE APA YOU'LL SEE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING LANGUAGE IN SB ONE BUT IT WAVES -- L. REVIEW AND IT DOES NOT CREATE AN EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENT WHICH WE'VE FOUND TO BE A PROBLEM GIVEN THAT AGAIN ANY ANY ENTITY CAN SUE AT ANY TIME ON THESE ISSUES. WE WOULD LIKE FINALITY IN THE REGULATIONS AND SO I THINK THAT'S JUST BASIC GOOD PUBLIC POLICY WOULD BE. HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE OF THIS BILL AND AND CERTAINLY THE CHAIR -- ON A RESOLUTION ON THAT ISSUE. A SECOND BIG ISSUE THAT IS IN THE PURVIEW OF THIS JURISDICTION AND I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE COMMITTEE NOW THIS IS A REALLY GOOD JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THIS -- IS REALLY WITH REGARD TO SECTION G. OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SECTION. RELATING THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ACT OF NINETEEN OH TWO SPECIFICALLY SECTION. EIGHT IN OUR VIEW. AND WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM OPPONENTS AS THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW STANDARDS IT'S PRESERVING EXISTING STANDARDS IT'S NO EXPANSION OF CALIFORNIA LAW. WE HAVE YET TO SEE ANY CASE LAW OR ANY PRESIDENT TO SHOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE SPECIES ACT IS APPLICABLES TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION A FEDERAL AGENCY. SPECIFICALLY WHEN ITS PRE EMPTED BY THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND WE BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF GOING INTO THE CASE LAW ON THIS. AT BEST IT'S AN UNSETTLED AREA OF LAW AT BEST IF THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT EXTENT EXPANDING AND ABOUT PRESERVING EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. PROVISION G. SHOULD BE STRICKEN AND THAT IS OUR POSITION FROM DAY ONE ON THAT. WE HAVE NOT GOT IT THIS BILL OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT WOOD PRESERVING THE STATED INTENT WHICH IS PRESERVING CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING STANDARDS FROM FEDERAL ROLE BOX. THANKS THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU -- I AM JENNIFER APPEAR IN THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS WHICH REPRESENTS TWENTY SEVEN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALSO DOES NOT THAT I HAVE A DEGREE IN CONSERVATION BIOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS I'M A SCIENTIST AT HEART IT'S SCIENCE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PROMOTE. UNFORTUNATELY -- SB ONE AMENDMENTS HAVE NOT GONE AS FAR AS ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR CONTINUING SCIENCE ACTUALLY -- IMPROVE ON INFORM OUR PERMITS IT SAYS THAT THE PROTECTIONS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FROM BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED OF THE FIFTH FEDERAL BASELINE FROM TEN YEARS AGO. WE'VE BEEN INVESTING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SCIENCE SENSE THEN WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION AND THIS BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR THE FEDERAL OR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO BE SUBJECT TO THAT SCIENCE IN THEIR NEW PERMITS. THIS THIS PORTION OF THE BILL'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF THE BILL WITH THE REST THE BILL THAT A REGULATION LEVEL AS WRITTEN THE ESSAY SECTION IS DOWN INTO THE PERMIT LEVEL TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL WAY IN WHICH YOU CALCULATE TAKE OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES. AT THE STATE WATER PROJECT FACILITIES WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS REMAINING WITH THE ESSAY SECTION OF THE BILL. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT IF IT'S NOT AMENDED THAT IT ALL DOES NOT ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY LOCKS IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO TEN YEAR OLD PERMIT TERMS. AND SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE FUTURE OF THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT FOR THAT NATURE AND THAT'S THE SAME CONCERN WE HAVE ON SECTION G. WHICH IS -- CREATING UNCERTAINTY IN THAT MANNER FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WHICH IS ALSO A MAJOR PARTICIPANT IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION. INVOLUNTARY AGREEMENT AND IT WOULD CREATE MASSIVE CHAOS WITHIN THE WATER COMMUNITY WHERE I THINK WE'RE FINALLY ON A TRAJECTORY. FOR SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY STABLE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. DENNIS HOBBY ON AND WE HAVE THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY M. W. D.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. FOR ITS SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] THIS AGO. I'M. SO SORRY I HAD TO STEP OUT THERE AND I MISSED A LOT OF THE EARLIER TESTIMONY -- I KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IS. THE ISSUE OF THE LISTING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF OF SPECIES AND FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS WHEN IT COMES. TO THE ELDER BERRY -- BEETLE YEAR IN CALIFORNIA THAT. IS A HUGE COST DRIVER OF A LOT OF LEVY PROJECTS AND WATER RESOURCES PROJECTS THAT. THAT WE OUGHT I THINK AGREED NEED TO GET DONE -- AND AT ONE POINT THERE WAS PROPOSAL TO DE LISTED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED TO BE DE LISTED -- BY THE RELEVANT AGENCY AND YOU KNOW THROUGH ALL THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS WAS ULTIMATELY STOCKTON IN THAT. DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN AND SO. THERE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT GOES INTO THOSE DECISIONS AS AS SHOULD BE. BUT YOU KNOW TO ADD KIND OF AN EXTRA LAYER THEIR WHERE MAYBE HERE AT THE STATE IF. YOU KNOW IF THAT WERE TO BE DE LISTED IT WOULD HELP SOME OF OUR WATER PROJECTS. I KNOW THAT'S A BIG CONCERN SO IT MAY BE IF BOTH OF YOU YOU KNOW THE PROPONENT. MR LIPPER AND AND OTHERS COULD. OF OPPOSITION TO KIND OF SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE -- IN IN AND WHAT IF ANY. MAYBE AS OR SOMETHING WE COULD DO MAYBE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER -- A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A COMPLICATED AREA OF LAW TO BE SURE AND I REPORT I THINK SENATOR ATKINS RECOGNIZES THAT -- THE COMMITTEES IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT HERE THESE ISSUES OFTEN ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEES ENOUGH TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO I REALIZE THIS IS A CHALLENGING. SUBJECT AREA TO BE REVIEWING -- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO DELISTING AND THE CONCERN THE OPPONENTS OF RACE AND AND I AGAIN EMPHASIZE WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE OPPONENTS AND CONSTRUCTIVELY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND I BELIEVE CENTER ATKINS WANTS TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE OPPONENTS -- WITHDRAW THEIR OPPOSITION BUT I WOULD SAY TO YOU -- IN. RESPONSE TO THE CONCERN THAT THE SOMEHOW FREEZES THE SCIENCE AND DOESN'T PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT THE THE CONCERN IS. THAT THE OPPONENTS HAVE. PLEASE LOOK AT PAGE FIFTEEN OF THE BILL LINES TWELVE THROUGH. EIGHTEEN AND I DON'T WANT TO READ THEM TO THE COMMITTEE BUT IT VERY CLEARLY SAYS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THIS IS THE AGENCY THAT OVERSEES THE LISTING IN THE LISTING OF SPECIES. SHALL ENSURE THAT THE PROTECTIONS ARE AT LEAST AS PROTECTIVE AS FEDERAL LAW NUMBER. ONE AND NUMBER TWO ACCORDING TO THE BEST AVAILABLE SILENT SCIENCE SO THAT IS AN EXPLICIT DIRECTIVE. TO OUR STATE AGENCY THAT OVERSEES ENDANGERED SPECIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SCIENCE THAT THEY USE TO MAKE THE DETERMINATIONS HERE. ARE IS THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE OF WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT DOESN'T FREEZE ANYTHING IN PLACE OF BACK TO GIVES DIRECTION TO THE AGENCY. THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE ON THIS ISSUE IS. AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS CONTEXT -- WATER AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THAT WORLD RIGHT NOW IS IN FLUX AS FOR THE THOSE PARTIES TO FOLLOW THESE ISSUES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MOVING FAIRLY AGGRESSIVELY TO REDUCE THE US STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AND ON A ON OTHER WATER SUPPLIES IN CALIFORNIA. SO THEY'RE IN THEIR CHANGING AND THE IDEA HERE IT IS AGAIN NOT TO INCREASE THE REQUIREMENTS BUT RATHER TO KEEP IN PLACE WHAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE AND HAS BEEN ACCEPTED -- REQUIREMENTS OF CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW FOR MANY YEARS AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY CENTER ACTIONS WANTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE. AND IS LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE OPPONENTS CONCERNS BUT I THINK HER RESPONSES IF IT CROSSES THAT LINE INTO ALLOWING A WEAKENING OF THE EXISTING FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS I THINK SHE HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACTS. ON ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES I'D ALSO LIKE TO LET KATE A POOL RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE. SURE. I'M THE LISTING FOR UP. QUESTION IN PARTICULAR I'D -- POINT THE COMMITTEE TO SECTION ONE TWO ZERO ZERO SIX ONE BE OF THE BILL. THERE'S NO AUTOMATIC LISTING SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO DO YOU LAST. WHATEVER SPECIES WHAT HAPPENS UNDER THIS BILL IS THAT THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION THEN. IT TRIGGERS A PROCESS WHERE THEY TAKE A SORT OF EXPEDITED LOOK AT THAT THE LISTING. AND BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S INPUT THEY EITHER SORT OF LISTED IMMEDIATELY THEY DETERMINE -- THAT LISTING IS NOT WARRANTED OR THEY DETERMINE THAT IT SHOULD GO THROUGH THE REGULAR LISTING PROCESS SO. IT ALL IS STILL -- THIS TRIGGERS A PROCESS BY WHICH THE EXPERT AGENCIES CAN REVIEW THE UP. OKAY AND JUST OPPOSITION YOU HAVE CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A WILLINGNESS. TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS ARE THERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU GUYS WOULD REQUEST GOING FOR THAT WOULD HELP. WITH THE SITUATION. WELL I WANT TO RESPOND TO THE OTHER VERY BEETLE I THINK IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT ACTUALLY WAS PROPOSED FOR DELISTING. SIX SEVEN YEARS AGO SO NOT EVEN UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION AND REALLY QUESTION COULD YOU JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS ABOUT YES. I WAS I WAS ASKING RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE INCLUDING THE DELISTING BUT WHAT COULD BE CHANGED ALSO IN THE BILL TO HELP WITH THAT SITUATION. BUT I COULD BE BRIEF ABOUT THAT THESE ARE REALLY MORE ISSUES FOR OTHER JURORS ARE THERE COMMITTEES JURISDICTION. WHAT THE THE PROBLEM WAS IT DIDN'T GO TO PARKS AND WILDLIFE TO THIS ISSUE HASN'T BEEN DAYLIGHT DANNY IS THE LAST POLICY COMMITTEES THAT TO THE? HOW TO RESPECT I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION ALL ALL THOSE AS A QUESTION? JUST ANSWER QUESTIONS FAIR ENOUGH. TO TO RESPOND YES IT SAYS BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE HOWEVER THE BUILDING CONSISTENT INTERNALLY IF YOU LOOK ON LINES TWENTY THREE THROUGH TWENTY NINE OF PAGE FOURTEEN OF THE BILL. IT'S AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE SHALL ENSURE THAT THE PROTECTIONS REMAIN IN PLACE. WE AS ATTORNEYS READ THAT ADDS BASICALLY FREEZING IN PLACE IT AND USE THE WORD FREEZE BUT SHALL ENSURE THE PROTECTION REMAIN IN PLACE. IS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE BIOLOGICAL PINIONS THE INTERNAL TAKE PERMITS BASICALLY THE PERMIT LEVELS ARE BEING FROZEN IN TIME YOU CAN THROW AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE IT DOESN'T. CHANGE THAT THEY SHALL ENSURE THE PROTECTIONS REMAIN IN PLACE SO IT'S VERY LEAST IT'S INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT. JUST SO EVERYONE ELSE'S AWARE WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT DEAL WITH THE DOWN LISTING AND THE LISTING ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOWN LISTS OR D. LIST A FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES. WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ALLOWS THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TO STEP IN AND REVIEW WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO LISTED UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF THAT. AND WE PROPOSED TO MEMBERS THAT DURING THAT INTERIM REVIEW PROCESS THE PROTECTIONS UNDER THE BIOPSY AND THAT'LL TAKE PERMITS AND INTEL TAKE STATEMENTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL REMAIN IN PLACE DURING THAT PERIOD SO THAT THERE IS NO GAP THAT'S THURMOND PROPOSED. WE'VE ALSO. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT. THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE BILL LINES FOURTEEN THROUGH EIGHTEEN BASICALLY SAYS. THEY'RE DOING THE REVIEW WITHOUT THE REGULAR LISTING PROCESS SET FORTH UNDER THE FISHING GAME CODE SO WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WILL BE ANALYZING THE SPECIES. IT'S INACCURATE TO SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE DONE HOW THEY NORMALLY DO IT. THEY'RE DOING UNDER A VERY EXPEDITED TIMELINE WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE REGULAR LISTING PROCESS SO AGAIN THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH INTENT TO PRESERVING EXISTING STANDARDS WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ALLOW THEM TO LOOK AT THE LIST AT DALLAS THAT SPECIES. PLACE THEM ON SEATS IF IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT THEY SHOULD DO SO UNDER EXISTING SEES A FRAMEWORK. AND THEY GET THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE WHILE THAT PERIODS IN ORDER TO ADD TO SEE SAID YES THEY HONOR TO ALL GO RIGHT TO YOU MISS PEER -- SO THOSE WERE TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY GOOD POINT SIR ARE THE IS THAT SOMETHING WE COULD INSERT IN THE LANGUAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE SHALL KEEP PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. YOU'RE UNLESS BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. REQUIRES OTHERWISE OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO AND THEN AND THEN IN CODING IN THERE THAT IT HAS TO BE THE REGULAR SEAS. PROCESS IS THAT CORRECT THAT YOU WERE BRINGING UP YES I MEAN AT THAT THE ISSUE IS THIS BILL POTENTIALLY CREATES A TON OF LITIGATION WITH HOW IT'S STRUCTURED WE PROPOSE AMENDMENTS THAT STILL PROTECT THE SPECIES FROM DALLAS IN DELISTING. WITHOUT CREATING A NEW WHAT'S A LESS PROTECTIVE STANDARD UNDER EXISTING SEES A WHAT WE'VE A JEOPARDY STANDARD THERE'S A FIVE RECOGNIZE LAW NOT DIRECTED. RIGHT SO I MEAN ARE YOU HAVING RIGHT I MEAN HE DO YOU THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ROOM ON THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR MISTER GALLAGHER SENATOR ATKINS IS VERY OPEN TO ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES THE SPECIFIC CHANGES PROPOSED I WANNA MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS UNDERSTAND. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE REGULAR LISTING PROCESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ACTIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT ARE WEAKENING THE EXISTING PROCESS AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS KEEP THOSE STANDARDS IN PLACE. THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING THAN LISTING A NEW SPECIES OR DE LISTING A SPECIES IT'S SAYING WHAT EXISTS TODAY THAT IS BEING ROLLED BACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SHOULD BE KEPT IN PLACE. WITH RESPECT TO MISTER REGULARS CONCERN ABOUT THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. THIS IS THE FIRST THAT WE'RE HEARING THAT BECAUSE THE PRO TEM ADDED THAT LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY TO SAY WE'RE NOT FREEZING ANYTHING IN PLACE WHAT WERE FREEZING IN PLACES. THE PROTECTIONS BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND THAT'S HOW THAT SENTENCE READS. I'M NOT I HAVE TO GO BACK AND DUST OFF MY ENGLISH BOOKS FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO WRITE IT TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR WERE. MORE I KNOW THE PART TIME WOULD BE MORE THAN OPEN TO DOING THAT OKAY. AND YES MISS HIGHER I COULD SPEAK THERE'S A THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT WHAT BLESSED PROTECTED MEANS ARE EQUAL PROTECTED ESA FEDERAL USA AND THE CALIFORNIA DINNERS BECAUSE ACT ARE VERY DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR TAKE. THEY COVER DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS THEY COVER DIFFERENT SPECIES SO IT'S VERY UNCLEAR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REMAIN IN PLACE DOES THAT MEAN THAT DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE IS NOW. ESSENTIALLY ADOPTING FEDERAL ESA STANDARDS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IT'S VERY UNCLEAR WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS AND AND HOW THIS ACTUALLY PLAYS OUT WHAT STANDARDS DFW EVEN USES. TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS NOT THE LISTING PROCESS BUT THIS REMAIN IN PLACE IN THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT I MEAN THEY ARE THEY ARE DIFFERENT. AND SO HOW IT MAYBE MAYBE CLARIFY THAT IN LAW WHAT I WAS THE HELP. AND I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO A LOT OF OUR WATER RESOURCES PROJECTS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON HER IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW. HOW THAT GETS? INTERPRETED. RAY IS GONNA MAKE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE RIGHT AND SO. I THINK IF WE COULD WORK ON THOSE THOSE ISSUES IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL GOING FORWARD I CAN PUTS YOU MISTER GALLAGHER THAT THE PRO TEM AND AND FRANKLY THE OPPONENTS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD AND CONSTRUCTIVE ON THIS BILL THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND. SOLUTION ON THIS ALONG WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT QUESTION THAT THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE AS WE HAVE RAISED. I THINK LESSONS. COMMENTS THIS PETRIE-NORRIS SO I QUESTION IT'S ALSO ABOUT AT THE ESA SECTIONS SO WHAT I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY A COUPLE TIMES IS THAT THE INTENT IS TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT OUR EXISTING LEVEL STANDARDS NOT. TO YOU OFFER ANYTHING MORE EXPENSIVE IT SO IS THAT IS THAT A CORRECT UNDERSTANDING THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. SO THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES MISS BETWEEN OURS I DO WANNA MAKE A CLARIFICATION I DO THINK AND AND FAIRNESS TO BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS. I THINK PROTECTING THE EXISTING STANDARDS IS A QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE EXISTING STANDARDS THEY'RE BEING CHANGED RIGHT NOW UNDER THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION WASHINGTON DC. THERE HAVE BEEN LONG STANDING DISPUTES AMONG PARTIES ABOUT WHAT THE STANDARD SHOULD BE WHETHER THE STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACTION CONTROL OF THE FEDERAL ACT. AND SOME OF THAT IS PLAYING OUT HERE SO I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR WITH YOU BUT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL FROM SENATOR ACHEN STANDPOINT. IS STATED SIMPLY TO PROTECT AND pNOT TO ADD MORE BUT ALSO NOT. TO EITHER ALLOW OPPORTUNITIES TO DELAY WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY THROUGH LITIGATION OR CHALLENGES SO IN THAT RESPECT WE AGREE WITH THE OPPONENTS WE DON'T WANT. CUMBERSOME PROCESS SEES WHERE THE STANDARDS ALREADY PRETTY CLEAR BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT TRYING TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF OF WHAT THE CURRENT STANDARDS ARE OKAY GOT IT SO. THAT'S INTENT THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW PERHAPS SOME DISAGREEMENT ON THE EDGES ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT STANDARD ACTUALLY IT'S OKAY GOT THAT. TO THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS DOES SAY. I UNLIKE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL RELATED TO AIR WATER AND LABOR LAW STANDARDS THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL RELATED TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SPECIES. GO BEYOND SIMPLY THE STATUTE AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS SO IS THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS AGAIN YOU FROM THE LEGAL INTERPRETED INTERPRETATION SIDE SO. GIVEN WHAT YOU SAID IS IS THE PRETENDS INTENSE. ARE YOU OPEN ISSUE OPEN TO LOOKING AT THAT YES A SECTION. YES MA'AM ABSOLUTELY CASHIERS I WILL SAY AND I THIS IS A POINT OF CONTENTION AND I'VE I'VE VERY HESITANT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT. COMMITTEE STAFF BECAUSE I WAS A COMMITTEE STAFFER TWENTY FOUR YEARS MYSELF -- I DO THINK IF YOU READ THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THE ESA PROVISIONS. ARE. MORE GRANULAR THAN THE ERROR WATER PROVISIONS -- IS NOT ACCURATE AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THE AIR WATER PROVISIONS. DEVOLVED TO THE WE TALK ABOUT AFFLUENT STANDARDS FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS BILL FOR WATER QUALITY WHICH THE OPPONENTS. HAVE AGREED TO THEIR OKAY ON THAT PROVISION AFFLUENT STANDARDS ARE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS JUST AT THE PARK AT A BASIC LEVEL JUST AS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND OTHER TOOLS ARE USED IN THE INTEREST SPECIES ACT WORLD. OUR PERMIT CONDITIONS SO I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT THERE -- IN TERMS OF HOW GRANULAR THE ANALYSIS AND REQUIREMENTS ARE WITH RESPECT TO THE ESSAY PROVISIONS AS COMPARED TO THE OUR WATER PROVISIONS. OKAY. SEP BUT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I'M ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT. YOUR CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION IT WOULD BE HELPFUL THAT WE CAN RESOLVE CONDITION MEANING ISSUES AND I THINK FLUSH OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND INTERPRETATION BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO THAT NOW BEFORE IT'S IN TRYING TO INS MA'AM Là HIDE I THINK THAT. THE FACT THAT THE OPPONENTS AGREE THAT THE UNDERLYING PURPOSE THE BILL. IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY AGREE WITH IS A GOOD SIGN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO AND I THINK THE POTENTIALS VERY STRONGLY. THAT IF WE AGREE ON THAT FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE WORDS ON THE PAGE ARE WRITTEN AND WHAT THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE GOING AND I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF THE TENSION THAT YOU'RE HEARING IN THE OPPOSITION TODAY. HI THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOU WILLING TO WORK WITH US BECAUSE IT. THROUGHOUT THIS ALL THIS NOTION OF MAINTAINING STANDARDS. GETS DIFFICULT BECAUSE MAINTAINING FEDERAL STANDARDS VERSUS MAINTAINING STATE STANDARDS ARE NOT THE SAME. TO PUSH THINGS TO AN EMERGENCY REGULATION. REGULATORY PROCESS WHEN THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY AN EMERGENCY WE MAY THINK POLITICALLY THERE'S EMERGENCY THERE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AN EMERGENCY. BUT FOR US THE LEVERAGE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS BYPASS SAYING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS GOING FORWARD WILL BE AN EMERGENCY. THROWS QUESTION INTO THOSE ASSUMPTIONS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING OUT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN EXPEDITED PROCESS. I'M FINE WITH THAT IN FACT IF. WE END UP EXPANDING [inaudible] CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTALISTS. SPECIES ACT AND AND LISTING MORE ULTIMATELY. I AM FINE WITH THAT BUT USING THESE MECHANISMS IS WHERE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT'S WHY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE VERY CLEAR. THAT WERE NOT. UNNECESSARILY TAKING THE PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PROCESSES. OUT OF CONTENTION AS WE MOVE THROUGH THESE AND FOR US TO SIMPLY ADOPT A FEDERAL STANDARD. ISN'T QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT BECAUSE THAT IS INCREASING A CALIFORNIA STANDRD. AS OPPOSED TO JUST TAKING SOMETHING THAT WAS FEDERAL THAT'S WHERE WE GET INTO SOME OF THE DISTINCTIONS THAT I THINK ARE NOT THAT SIMPLE -- TO MAY AND AND BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE RELYING ON THESE AND CHANGE CALIFORNIA LAW. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS SUCCESSFUL AND THAT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN. EITHER. CHANGING PRESERVING OR INCREASING CALIFORNIA STANDARD TO THE FEDERAL STANDARD WHERE NECESSARY AND THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERTS COMMIT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE LOOK TO YOUR COMMITTEE AND YOUR STAFF FOR EXPERTISE IN THAT AREA AND THE PRO TEM WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU.
