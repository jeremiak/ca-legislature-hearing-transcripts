PROTECTED BY LAW USING THE

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.759

00:36:57.315 --> 00:37:00.117
ELEMENT IN IN AGAIN REMEMBER

IF YOU HAVE MATERIAL THAT'S A-

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:08.960
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AND

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:10.394
THEIR CHARGE FOR THE WORK IS

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:11.629
GOING TO BE THREE OR FOUR

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.397
HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT EXCEEDS IT

00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:15.433
SO A CONTRACTOR MUST BE

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:17.234
OBTAINED IN THAT'S THE ISSUE

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:19.103
IT'S JUST THE COST AND IT'S GOT

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.671
TO BE AN ADJUSTMENT. AND AS WE

I THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER THAT

CLEARS THINGS UP I THINK ON MY

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.554
END AND I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:39.056
THAT- THIS. THE AGGREGATE

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:41.125
AGGREGATE CONTACT. CONTRACT

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:43.394
PRICE HASN'T INCREASED IN

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:45.296
TWENTY THREE YEARS A NUMBER OF

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.898
CST- HAVE INCREASED IN

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:50.234
CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST TWENTY

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.268
THREE YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.804
HAS SEEN FIT. TO MAKE SURE

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:56.374
THAT- PAYMENT MATCHES THE

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.142
RISING COSTS FOR INSTANCE THE

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.277
MINIMUM WAGE- WE CONTINUE TO

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.679
RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:03.347
THE COST OF LIVING IN

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:04.448
CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED OVER

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:06.951
TIME. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:09.086
THERE'S- A BIG DIFFERENCE

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.721
BETWEEN THE TWO WE'RE TALKING

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.590
ABOUT. THE RISE IN THE COST OF

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:14.392
MATERIALS THE RISE IN THE COST

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:16.794
OF LABOR. MEAN FOR I'M JUST

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.963
THINKING BACK TO WHEN. AROUND

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.565
FENCE BLEW OVER IN OUR YARD.

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:24.101
AND THE COST HAD SUBSTANTIALLY

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:25.603
INCREASED FOR THE MATERIALS TO

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.772
REPLACE THAT. NOT BECAUSE OF

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:29.106
THE PERSON CHOOSING TO DO THE

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:29.974
WORK JUST BECAUSE OF THE

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.076
MARKETPLACE SO IT INCREASES.

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:33.878
THE COST AND THAT THAT'S NOT

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:36.013
YOU KNOW ANYBODY'S FAULT IT'S

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.882
THOSE ARE JUST THE FACTS. SO

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:41.252
THE COST HAVE INCREASED IN.

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:43.421
TWENTY THREE YEAR TIMES I JUST

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:45.256
WOULD CHALLENGE THE LEGISLATURE

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:47.458
TO FIND. SOMETHING THAT IS

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:48.392
WITHIN THEIR POWER TO

00:38:48.459 --> 00:38:53.898
INCREASED. THE- IN. THE COST

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.332
FOR SOMEONE TO RETURN TO RECOUP

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:56.600
THAT THEY HAVEN'T YOU KNOW

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.536
INCREASED IT IN OTHER WORDS WE

00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:00.004
TAKE THESE OPPORTUNITIES ALL

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:01.939
THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.041
IT'S COSTING REVENUE ARE OUR-

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:06.911
MATCH SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.946
BILL I DON'T THINK THAT RAISING

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:13.851
IT TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS IS.

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.286
INAPPROPRIATE IN THE LEAST BIT

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:17.455
FRANKLY I SHOULD PROBABLY- BE

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.561

THAT. THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.618
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:50.521

TRY TO GET THREE BIDS WHETHER

GETTING BIDS TO HOMEOWNERS AND

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.667
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SCENARIO.

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.469
WHERE THE REALTOR TELLSTHE

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:07.605

SOME CASES THEY WILL START WITH

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:17.615
THE HANDY PERSON BUT THEN WHEN

GET UP INTO FAR EXCEEDING THE

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.053

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.855
TO BE THE LICENSE CONTRACTOR

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.290

THIS BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.195

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.667
PRESENTED TO THE POTENTIAL

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.669

ROOFING AND TERMITE WORK. SO

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.846
THE FOUNDATION IS THERE. TO

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:45.349

FOLD OF THE TRANSACTION. AND

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.653
THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE'VE

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.355

THE NUMBER OF THE INFLATION.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.891
AND AND I THINK THIS IS THE

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.793
SPIRIT THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE AS

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.995
WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. AND I

00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:00.330
THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:03.133
THAT CAN'T COME TO FIX-

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.935
SOMETHING THAT'S MINOR. AND

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:06.436
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDED

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:08.338
TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ROOF OR

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:09.840
TO ADD A ROOM. AS YOU KNOW THE

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:11.274
INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.909
INTO GRANNY FLATS IN THE-

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:15.045
GARAGE EXTENSIONS AND SO ON. IN

00:50:15.112 --> 00:50:17.881
THOSE ARE JOBS THAT ARE NEEDED-

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:20.150
BY LICENSED CONTRACTORS IN THE

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.418
CITY'S A MESS OF THE

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.587
MISCIBILITY THE WE REPRESENT.

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:25.088
THEY'RE GOING TO OVERSEE THAT

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.690
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:29.359
STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF. IS THE

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:31.261
MINISTER PALLIPES ON WEEKENDS

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:33.463

THAT CONTRACTOR WITHOUT THOSE

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:46.977
PERMITS. AND SO I'M TOTALLY IN

00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:47.944
THE SPIRIT OF DOING THE RIGHT

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.079

HATE QUOTAS. I WILL BRING

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:56.484
EVERYONE BACK TO A COUPLE YEARS-AGO WHEN WELLS FARGO IMPOSED

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:58.053
QUOTAS AND THEY ULTIMATELY

01:20:58.119 --> 01:20:59.888
ENDED UP PAYING THREE BILLION

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:02.190
DOLLARS IN PENALTIES BECAUSE

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.092
THEIR EMPLOYEES FELT SO

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:06.161
COMPELLED TO MEET THOSE QUOTAS

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:07.529
THEY WERE ILLEGALLY AND

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.864
FRAUDULENTLY SIGNING PEOPLE UP

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:10.765
FOR ACCOUNTS THAT THEY DID NOT

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:14.169
ASK FOR. THE QUOTAS RARELY DO

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:15.937
WHAT THOSE WHO IMPOSE THEM

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.872
THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:19.341
AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTED

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.176
PHARMACISTS FOR TWENTY YEARS

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:21.743
THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.545
CARING AND KNOWLEDGEABLE AND

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.947
CONCERNED PEOPLE I HAVE EVER

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:29.017
MET. AND WORKED WITH QUOTAS ARE

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:31.186
IMPOSED ON A PHARMACIST. YOU'RE

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:32.854
NOT JUST SIGNING UP AN ACCOUNT

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.856
THAT SOMEONE DIDN'T ASK FOR ONE

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:37.525
PHARMACISTS ARE PUSHED TO THE

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:39.227
TO THE EDGE. BOTH LIVES COULD

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:42.097
pBE IN DANGER SO I THINK ALSO

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:45.000
THAT THE PENALTY PART- YOU KNOW

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.401
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PENALTIES

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.169
CORPORATIONS DELAY PENALTIES

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:50.138
BUT WITHOUT A PENALTY IS JUST A

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:52.173
SUGGESTION. SO YOU HAVE TO PUT

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.475
A PENALTY IN PLACE IF YOU

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:54.909
REALLY WANT THE POLICY TO BE

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:57.045
CARRIED OUT. THEN WHEN THE

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:58.113
OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT THE

01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.582
PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT THEY

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:01.683
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE PUT IN

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.218
PLACE I JUST THINK THAT THERE

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:05.153
ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT YOU THAT

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.922
A COMPANY HAS AN ABILITY. TO

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:10.025
SEE IF A PHARMACIST IS

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.526
PERFORMING OR PHARMACY IS

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.361
PERFORMING LIKE OTHER RELATIVE

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.929

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.731
COUNTY LEVELS- PHARMACY WERE

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:18.266
ONLY FILLING HUNDREDS

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.035

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.473
WELL WHAT IS SENATOR NEWMAN

DURING THAT CENTER LIVE IS NOT

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.810
DOING SO THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.779
THAN PERFORMANCE QUOTAS WHICH I

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:31.813
WILL SAY ARE USUALLY PUT IN

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.415

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:43.825
LITTLE HAPPY AND A LITTLE

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:45.927
UNHAPPY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:46.628
THE COMMUNITIES WILL BE

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:04.819
BE PART OF A QUOTA AND THAT

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:07.522
VERY MUCH CONCERNS B. I WROTE

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:08.656
THE BILL ON THE WELLS FARGO

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:10.792
QUOTA THEY DID PUT A BIG ANEL

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:12.560
IS THE END FOR WELLS FARGO I

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:13.127
DON'T THINK THEY WERE EVEN A

01:27:13.194 --> 01:27:15.229
MILLION BUCKS BUT- BE THAT AS

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:18.666
IT MAY- BUT I THINK THAT THE-

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:19.968
PROGRAMS OFFERED TO PATIENTS.

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:21.536
IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON WE

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:22.670
SHOULD NOT ALLOW OUR

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.739
PHARMACISTS TO BE HAVE QUOTAS

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:27.175
ON ANY OF THAT TYPE OF. REVENUE

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:29.510
OBTAINED SAME THING. I THINK

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:30.578
THAT THAT REALLY OBSCURES

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:33.514
PATIENT- QUALITY. AND- SHOULD

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.083
NOT BE ALLOWED. BUT IF THE

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:36.985
METRICS OF SOME KIND FOR

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:37.952
PRESCRIPTIONS BUILDING

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:40.788
SERVICES. RENDERED TO PATIENTS.

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:43.791
CAN BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE- I

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:44.425
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU EVER

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:47.462

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:49.063
AT A YOU KNOW AT A PHARMACY AND

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:51.065

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:51.933

HERE IS- HAVE UNINTENDED

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.569
CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.304
BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.906
BILL AND ALL THE SIDE NOW- WE

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:01.309
HAVE OUR CONSTITUENTS. WAITING

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.211
LONGER LINES THAN THEY EVER HAD

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:06.047
HAD BEFORE I THINK THE FINANCE

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:09.851
FRANKLY I FIND THEM OUTRAGEOUS-

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:11.252
WE TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT THE

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:12.720
COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.155
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.623
OFTENTIMES WE VOTE ON BILLS

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.359

QUOTAS. FOR THE SAME TIME IF

01:32:30.544 --> 01:32:31.545
SOMEBODY IS AN EMPLOYEE YOU

01:32:31.612 --> 01:32:32.747
NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.248
METRICS TO EVALUATE THEIR

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:36.851
PERFORMANCE BY- AND I THOUGHT

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:39.053
THE- THE OPPOSITION THE ISSUE

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.955

TECHNICIANS WAS ALSO GOOD

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:43.691
POINT. THEY DO BELIEVE THAT WE

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.927
HAVE MORE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:49.030

SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:57.872
DO THINK IT RAISES A LOT OF

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:00.708
INTERESTING ISSUES- ABOUT WHERE

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.510
WE END UP IF WE KEEP EXTENDING.

01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:04.312
THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO

01:33:04.378 --> 01:33:05.179
PRACTICE AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:08.149
SETTINGS. THEN IT HOW DOES THAT

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:09.350
FIT INTO THE SETTINGS THAT ARE

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.619
BEING CREATED. THROUGH WITH OUR

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:16.223
SAME PROCESS. OF EVOLUTION SO-

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:16.824
NOT REALLY A QUESTION I GUESS

01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:18.526
BUT A LOT OF. A LOT OF

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:21.295

SOME OF THE VERY GOOD AND NOBLE

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.373
POINTS IN THE FIELD THAT TIME

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.307
TO ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.609
TROUBLING. FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:38.412
SUPPORT IT TODAY AS THAT OF.

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:40.114
THE PENALTY FOR ONE IN A CHAIN

01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:42.450
WOULD EXPAND TO ALL IN A CHAIN

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:43.884
AND THAT COULD CLOSE ON

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.653
HUNDREDS OF PHARMACIES ACROSS

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.655
THE STATE AND THAT WOULD PUT

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:49.256
THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND REALLY

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:51.993
POTENTIALLY HARM. ARE PROBABLY

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:53.761
HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:55.162
INDIVIDUALS USING THOSE

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:56.364
PHARMACIES THAT SAY IT'S AN

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:57.999
RIDE DATA WALL GRAINS WHEREVER

01:33:58.065 --> 01:33:59.367
THAT HAPPENS TO BE SO I THINK

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:01.235
WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THE

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.270
PENALTIES SPECIFICALLY AND HOW

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:05.806
THAT WOULD AFFECT A WHOLE CHAIN

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:07.908
NUMBER TWO IS THE DEFINITION OF

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:09.744
A COMMUNITY PHARMACY. ARE WE

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.245
HAVE ONE IN OUR MIND MY

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:13.047
COMMUNITY THAT'S REALLY AREN'T

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:14.348
INDEPENDENTLY OWNED AND

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.584
OPERATED BY A PHARMACIST YET HE

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.085
COULD BE OR THEY COULD BE

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:20.421
DEFINED AS A COMMUNITY PHARMACY

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.790
MAKE ONE MISTAKE AND- I BELIEVE

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:24.759
THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY WILL PUT

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.093
THEM BASICALLY OUT OF BUSINESS

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.628
AND THEY ARE A COMPOUNDING.

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:29.797
PHARMACY LIKE OUR FORMER

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:32.233

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:36.070
VERY SIGNIFICANT WORK AND

01:34:36.137 --> 01:34:37.605
COMING UP WITH THOSE COMPOUNDS

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:39.040
THAT ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.841
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A SPECIAL

01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:42.877
NEEDS SO I THINK THOSE TWO

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.512
AREAS NEED A LOT MORE WORK.

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.547
THAT TIME CERTAINLY ON THE GOOD

PUTTING SOMETHING OUT THERE

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:53.521
THAT CERTAINLY NEEDS A CLOSER

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.923

WARNING. SECONDLY YOU KNOW I

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:47.775
THINKIT IS. RELEVANT TO THIS

01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:48.776
NOTION COMMUNITY PHARMACIES

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:49.843
THAT THAT IS FOR WHATEVER

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.678
REASON KIND OF A TERM OF ART-

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:53.514
IN THE EXISTING LEGISLATION

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.948
THAT IS THE TERM THAT USE

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:56.283
REFERRED ALL PHARMACIES SO THAT

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:59.186
MIGHT BE. WORTHY OF TIGHTENING

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:01.755
UP- BUT- YOU KNOW I DO. THAT

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:02.990
AND APPRECIATE THE INPUT OF ALL

01:41:03.056 --> 01:41:05.292
MY COLLEAGUES HERE- WE NEED TO

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:07.528
MAKE SURE. THAT WE DON'T

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:08.962
UNINTENTIONALLY CREATE MORE

01:41:09.029 --> 01:41:10.397
PROBLEMS THAN WE SOLVE I THINK

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:12.633
THAT'S TRUE ALL LEGISLATION-

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:13.233
BUT GENERALLY I THINK PUT IT

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.702
WELL. YOU CAN'T FIND MANY GOOD

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:17.070

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:20.274
QUOTAS. LEAD TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.609
GOOD RESULTS- IF ANYTHING- THEY

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:23.744
TEND TO CREATE SYSTEMIC

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:26.346
INCENTIVES FOR MISBEHAVIOR- AND

01:41:26.413 --> 01:41:26.880
IN THIS CASE I THINK IT'S

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:29.016
REALLY IMPORTANT. TO CONSIDER

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.685
THE VALUE OF NOT LETTING THAT

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:34.021
HAPPEN- PHARMACISTS ARE IN FACT

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:38.425
THE LAST- BARRIER IN SOME CASES

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:39.092
TO REALLY DANGEROUS

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:40.794
CONSEQUENCES. IN THE USE OF

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.629
DRUGS AND IN FACT WE'VE ASKED

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:43.864

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.999
OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. TO DO

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:47.401
SOME REALLY EXPLICIT THINGS

01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:49.436
THEY REQUIRE REQUIRED BY LAW.

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:51.338
TO TRACK A SERIES OF RED FLAGS

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:52.539
ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THE WAY

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:54.475
OF THAT OR OTHER- DELIBERATE

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:58.212

COMPLIANCE AT LEAST COMPLAINTS

01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:17.236
THAT REGULATION SHOULD BE MUCH

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:19.339
CLEARER AS TO HOW TO COMPLY SO

01:56:19.405 --> 01:56:20.907
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS DOES THIS

01:56:20.973 --> 01:56:22.975
BILL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN. THOSE

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:26.145
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE IS

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:26.746
THIS TREATING ALL REGULATIONS

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:31.184
THE SAME. RESEARCHER PLEASE

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:33.119
RESPOND YES I WANT TO THANK THE

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.321
A CENTER VERMONT SACRAMENTO-

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:38.691
THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION I'M

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:39.225
REALLY GLAD THAT- THAT HE

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:41.227
POSTED. I WANT MAKES IT

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:42.428
SOMETHING VERY MAKE SOMETHING

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:43.730
VERY CLEAR WITH THIS PROPOSED

01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:46.132
PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT IT

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:48.735
IS NOT MANDATING. THAT FINDS BE

01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:52.572
REDUCED FAT ALL. WHAT IS DOING

01:56:52.638 --> 01:56:56.376
IT IS- IT IS AUTHORIZING OF THE

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.311
VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND

01:56:58.378 --> 01:57:00.346
REGULATORY ENTITIES- UNDER THE

01:57:00.413 --> 01:57:02.281
UMBRELLA OF THE STATE TO DEVISE

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:04.283
THEIR OWN POLICIES THAT WOULD

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:06.619
ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS- TO BE

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:08.654
LOOKED UPON. UNDER CERTAIN

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:10.356
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR FINANCIAL

01:57:10.423 --> 01:57:13.626
REDUCTION. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:15.695
IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:17.630
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OF ANY

01:57:17.697 --> 01:57:19.732
DIVISION OF THE STATE. IT IS

01:57:19.799 --> 01:57:23.269
ONLY ALLOWING FOR A- A VEHICLE

01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:24.637
FOR DISCRETION TO BE EXERCISED

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:26.205
SO TO YOUR POINT THIS AND

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:27.907
THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE YOU

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:29.542
GET ITUATIONS WE HAVE EXISTING

01:57:29.609 --> 01:57:30.977
BUSINESSES TRYING TO DEAL WITH

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:32.912
CUMBERSOME NEW REGULATIONS AND

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:34.814
KEEP UP. OR YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:36.816
EXISTING BUSINESSES- WITH THE

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:38.518
BOULDER REGULATIONS AND VICE

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:40.553
VERSA SO THIS COULD BE A NUMBER

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.522
OF WAYS THIS PLAYS ITSELF OUT.

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:44.123
I THINK GO TO YOUR POINT WHEN

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:46.025
YOU HAVE A NEW BUSINESS AND

01:57:46.092 --> 01:57:49.061
THERE'S A TIRE BODY OF LAW AND

01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:50.963
REGULATION. IT IT'S CHALLENGES.

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:52.632
WE HAVE AN EXISTING BUSINESS

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:54.500
THAT IS EXPECTED TO ABIDE BY

01:57:54.567 --> 01:57:56.569
LONG STANDING LAWS. THEN THAT

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:58.237
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE DISCRETION

01:57:58.304 --> 01:58:00.139
IN THE LEVELS OF ENQUIRIES BY

01:58:00.206 --> 01:58:01.741
THESE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS

01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:03.443
SHOULD BE ABOUT. SHOULD YOU

01:58:03.509 --> 01:58:05.578
HAVE KNOWN. WERE YOU IN

01:58:05.645 --> 01:58:08.047
DECORATIONS IN NOT DOING X. Y.

01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:09.749
OR Z. IF YOU WERE THE PENALTY

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:12.985
STANDS- THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF

01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:14.320
THIS PIECE LEGISLATION IT

01:58:14.387 --> 01:58:17.023
SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THESE

01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:18.558
INDIVIDUALS TO CREATE POLICIES.

01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:20.126
WITH THE PERSON'S MOST

01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:22.428
KNOWLEDGEABLE I CAN'T COMMENT

01:58:22.495 --> 01:58:23.963
ON A VISALIA RESTAURANT

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:26.065
FACILITY FOR A SMALL BUSINESS

01:58:26.132 --> 01:58:27.800
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WOULD COVER

01:58:27.867 --> 01:58:30.036
ALL CONTACTS THE PERSON'S MOST

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:31.370
KNOWLEDGEABLE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:58:31.437 --> 01:58:33.272
WEIGH IN AT THAT MOMENT IN BE

01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:34.273
ABLE TO EXPLAIN. THIS WAS

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:36.676
NEGLIGENCE OR THIS WAS WILLFUL

01:58:36.742 --> 01:58:38.244
OR THIS WAS ACCIDENTAL BUT

01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:40.246
SERIOUS IN WHICH CASE NO

01:58:40.313 --> 01:58:42.215
REDUCTION I WAS GONNA BE ON THE

01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:44.717
TABLE. AND ALSO JUST TO CLARIFY

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:45.785
FOR EXAMPLE AND CHECKED EVEN

01:58:45.852 --> 01:58:47.353
HERE ON THE FLOOR TODAY WE'VE

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.321
TALKED ABOUT POTENTIAL

01:58:48.387 --> 01:58:49.789
OBVIOUSLY CAN POTENTIAL LAWS

01:58:49.856 --> 01:58:51.190
BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE PASSED

01:58:51.257 --> 01:58:54.727
YOUR YARD. FOR GENERALLY WE- WE

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:59.265
MAY SET A PENALTY AT A RANGE.

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:01.067
OR SAY A MAXIMUM OF. SO GIVEN

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:01.801
THE FACT THAT WE'RE THE

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:03.636
LEGISLATURE USUALLY PASS A BILL

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:05.671
AND PUT ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK

01:59:05.738 --> 01:59:07.673
WE WANTED TO BE AN SOURCE. IS

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:09.175
THAT ARE WE GIVING AGENCIES

01:59:09.242 --> 01:59:11.744
DISCRETION TO. ACT IN A WAY

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:13.546
THAT MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH

01:59:13.613 --> 01:59:14.580
A SET OF PENALTIES THAT WE

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:16.048
PASSED YEARS OF LEGISLATURE SO

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:17.149
I MEAN SIZE WILL GIVE A RANGE

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:19.218
SO I GET THAT OKAY FINE FOR

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:19.952
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:21.187
LOWER END TO RANGE VERSUS THE

01:59:21.254 --> 01:59:23.389

DETERMINATION IF IT WAS A

02:04:30.696 --> 02:04:33.032

GOING TO BE A VENUE OR NOT JUDY

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:36.769
TO PURSUE. BUT WE HAVE TO BE

02:04:36.836 --> 02:04:39.071
RON REALISTIC HERE THAT WE

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:40.039
DON'T WANT TO IN SUPPORT THIS

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:42.808

ENCOURAGES WILLFUL. OR CRIMINAL

02:04:45.911 --> 02:04:47.646
CONDUCT THAT'S OFF THE TABLE

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:49.348
AND IT DOES ALSO IS SERIOUS

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:51.684
HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:53.953
THREATS BUT I GO BACK TO THE

02:04:54.019 --> 02:04:55.654
ONE EXAMPLE I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:57.823
IN ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND. THAT

02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:59.959
I'VE THAT I'VE HEARD OF IN IN

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:01.894
DURING THE PANDEMIC OF

02:05:01.961 --> 02:05:02.795
INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO DO THE

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:04.496
RIGHT THING WANT TO DO THE

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:05.698
RIGHT THING WILL TAKE

02:05:05.764 --> 02:05:06.732
CORRECTIVE ACTION AFTER POINTED

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:08.901
OUT. BY TO ASSESS THE MAXIMUM

02:05:08.968 --> 02:05:12.304
PENALTY WITHOUT A MECHANISM. BY

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:14.540
AT ANY LEVEL THAT ALLOWS THEM

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:16.575
FOR THOSE CONSIDERATIONS TO BE

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:18.210
PART OF THE PROCESS IS IT WILL

02:05:18.277 --> 02:05:19.612
FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR AND I

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:20.646
BELIEVE THAT IF YOU REACH OUT

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:22.114
INTO THE COMMUNITIES THOSE

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:24.316
COMMUNITIES WANT TO DO THE

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:24.884
RIGHT THING BECAUSE THERE'S

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.352
NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:28.187
MANDATES THE STATE MUST REDUCE

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:30.022
THE PENALTY ACTUALLY NOTHING

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:31.724
THAT'S WHERE I THINK THERE'S A

02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:33.225
BIT OF HANG UP WITH SOME OF THE

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:35.427
FOLKS THAT HAVE CALLED IN. AND

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:36.929
I'M GLAD WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

TO CORRECT THEIR UNDERSTANDING.

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:41.467
IS THAT THIS DOES NOT MANDATE A

02:05:41.533 --> 02:05:48.307
REDUCTION AT ALL. AT ALL. AND

02:05:48.374 --> 02:05:49.141

02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:22.014
THAT THE- IN. OR AND ALL THE-

02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:23.682
AND CAN BE LANGUAGE. IS

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:26.752
ABSOLUTELY- AND I'M NOT TRYING

02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:27.319
TO PICK FOR THE DAY WANT TO

02:10:27.386 --> 02:10:28.921
MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:10:28.987 --> 02:10:29.721
WE'RE CAPTION YOU'RE NOT

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:32.624
SETTLING. I GUESS THE OTHER

02:10:32.691 --> 02:10:33.892
QUESTION- YOU KNOW YOU YOU SAID

02:10:33.959 --> 02:10:36.061
A FEW TIMES THAT- IF YOU'RE

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:37.829
NEGLIGENT. THEN YOU DON'T GET

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:39.932
ANY RELIEF. BUT THE WAY I

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:41.266
UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMBY

02:10:41.333 --> 02:10:43.168
WHICH YOU'RE DOING THIS THAT'S

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:44.436
NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT RIGHT

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:47.272
THAT- THE OPERATIVE LANGUAGES

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:49.141
THAT IS WILL FOR CRIMINAL

02:10:49.208 --> 02:10:51.443
CONDUCT RIGHT SO. THAT TAKES IT

02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:53.145
OFF THE TABLE IF IT'S WILL FOR

02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:54.646
CRIMINAL CONDUCT THEN YOU DON'T

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:55.647
GET YOU'RE NOT SUBJECT TO

02:10:55.714 --> 02:10:57.449
RELIEF BUT IF IT'S NOT WILL FOR

02:10:57.516 --> 02:11:01.053
CRIMINAL. THEN YOU ARE ELIGIBLE

02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:02.821
FOR RELIEF UNDER THE POLICIES

02:11:02.888 --> 02:11:03.355
DEVELOP A DIFFERENT STATE

02:11:03.422 --> 02:11:05.691
AGENCIES. AND ONE OF THE MANY

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:07.392
FACTORS THAT THEN GETS

02:11:07.459 --> 02:11:08.260
CONSIDERED IS WHETHER NEGLIGENT

02:11:08.327 --> 02:11:11.296
OR NOT. NOW MY CONCERN HEREIS

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:12.564
YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK TO THE

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:14.433
OPPOSITION'S LANGUAGE THEIR

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:16.401
CONCERN IS ONE I THINK A LOT OF

02:11:16.468 --> 02:11:18.503
A SHARE WHICH IS. THERE WILL BE

02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:20.505
BUSINESSES THAT ACTION VERY

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:24.176
VERY BADLY AND IGNORE THI. AND

02:11:24.243 --> 02:11:26.378
AS YOU KNOW WILLFUL OR IF IT

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:27.980
CRIMINALS VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:30.716
PROVE IN ANY COURT SAID. AND I

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.117
GUESS MY QUESTION IS WOULD YOU

02:11:32.184 --> 02:11:33.485
BE OPEN TO OR OR MAYBE YOU

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:35.020
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AND

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:35.754
DISMISSED IT NINETY INTEREST IN

02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:37.155
YOUR REASONING- WHY NOT ADD

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:38.957
GROSSLY NEGLIGENT OR WHY NOT DO

02:11:39.024 --> 02:11:40.459
SOMETHING LIKE NEGLIGENT AS A

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:42.594
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION BECAUSE-

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:43.762
YOU KNOW NEGLIGENCE IS A LOT

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:45.130
EASIER PROVE GROSS NEGLIGENCE

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:46.031
IS HARD TO PROVE BUT IT'S

02:11:46.098 --> 02:11:47.566
EASIER PROVEN WILLFUL WHERE YOU

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:48.700
JUST HAVE TO SHOW SOMEONE.

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:50.535
ACTUALLY MEANT TO DO THIS AND

02:11:50.602 --> 02:11:51.703
THAT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO

02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:53.071
IN A COURT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF

02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:55.073
A SMOKING GUN. AND THAT MAKES

02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:56.341
THIS YOU KNOW ALMOST ALL

02:11:56.408 --> 02:11:57.909
BUSINESSES I THINK WOULD UNDER

02:11:57.976 --> 02:11:59.911
THIS LANGUAGE BE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:01.913
THE POLICIES. AT WHICH POINT

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:03.081
NEGLIGENCE WOULD THEN BE A

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:04.516
FACTOR THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED

02:12:04.583 --> 02:12:05.350
SO I GUESS THEY THOUGHT MY

02:12:05.417 --> 02:12:06.718
QUESTION IS IF YOUR INTENTION

02:12:06.785 --> 02:12:09.154
WAS TO SAY. THAT NEGLIGENCE IF

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:10.689
THE BUSINESS WAS JUST TOTALLY

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:12.257
IGNORING ITS REGULATORY

02:12:12.324 --> 02:12:14.726
OBLIGATIONS THEY SHOULD NOT BE

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:16.395
ALLOWED TO DO THIS WHY NOT SORT

02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:17.696
OF PHRASES IN STRUCTURED THAT

02:12:17.763 --> 02:12:19.431
WAY AND ONCE AGAIN ON YOU BRING

02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:21.500
UP SOME- SOME IMPORTANT POINTS-

02:12:21.566 --> 02:12:23.201
YOUR LEGAL MIND IS GIVING YOU

02:12:23.268 --> 02:12:26.371
INSIGHT. INTO PARTICULARLY THAT

02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:27.005
I THINK IT'S HELPFUL THAT COULD

02:12:27.072 --> 02:12:29.875
MAKE THIS BETTER. AND I CAN EAT

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:32.344
EASILY- REVISIT THIS AND WOULD

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:34.046
EVEN ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE

02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:37.049
AND IN DOING SO- TO FINE TUNE

02:12:37.115 --> 02:12:42.521
THIS. IN THAT THE BEST WAY

02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:43.855
POSSIBLE BECAUSE ONCE THE- THIS

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:45.190
WILL NOT BE IS NOT IS. TO AND

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:47.559
BY ITS BY THE- THAT- THAT WERE

02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:48.927
MORE FORWARD WITH ANY WITH.

02:12:48.994 --> 02:12:50.028
POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS IN THE

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:54.666
COMING DAYS. IS NOT DESIGNED TO

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:57.102
ALLOW FOR WILLFUL IGNORANCE.

02:12:57.169 --> 02:12:59.271
INTENTIONAL OVERSIGHTS. OR

02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:01.073
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:03.075
SKIRT THE LAW. THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.943
WE ARE ALLOWING THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:06.878
WE WANT. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:09.247
CERTAIN THAT BUSINESSES- ARE

02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:13.552
GIVEN SOME EGREE OF- OF ALL

02:13:13.618 --> 02:13:15.020
VENUE THAT. DIVISIONS OF THE

02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:16.922
STATE HAVE A MECHANISM WITHIN

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:18.423
THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:20.759
DEPARTMENTS TO EVALUATE THESE

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:22.361
INSTANCES AND I MIGHT ALSO SAY

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:24.529
THAT THE FACTORS OF THE STATE

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:28.200
AGENCIES- SHOULD USE. IS ALSO

02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:30.168
IF AND TO WHAT EXTENT PENALTIES

02:13:30.235 --> 02:13:32.571
ARE EVEN ELIGIBLE RATE

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:35.073
REDUCTIONS ARE ELIGIBLE IF.

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:36.575
SOME OF THEM ARE NINE TWO TO BE

02:13:36.641 --> 02:13:38.810
ELIGIBLE AT ALL. THAT'S OKAY IF

02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:40.512
THE VIOLATIONS OR THAT TYPE OF

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:42.514
DANGER BASED ON THE PERSON'S

02:13:42.581 --> 02:13:43.415
MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THAT

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:45.550
SPECIFIC INDUSTRY- WITHIN THIS

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:47.786
THAT THE STATE AGENCIES. THEN

02:13:47.853 --> 02:13:48.253
THEY DON'T DESERVE THE

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.422
REDUCTION AT ALL IT'S NOT A

02:13:50.489 --> 02:13:52.791
RIGHT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY IF I

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:54.159
AND I APPRECIATE THAT A SENATOR

02:13:54.226 --> 02:13:56.762
I THINK- YOU KNOW THIS SOUNDS

02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:57.896
LIKE A VERY ACADEMIC TECHNICAL

02:13:57.963 --> 02:14:00.265
CONVERSATION BUT- IT'S

02:14:00.332 --> 02:14:01.633
OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.235
BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE. FOR

02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:05.070
AVERAGE PEOPLE WORKERS SMALL

02:14:05.137 --> 02:14:07.806
BUSINESS OWNERS. IS GOING TO BE

02:14:07.873 --> 02:14:10.008
IMPORTANT- AND AGAIN I JUST

02:14:10.075 --> 02:14:12.077
EMPHASIZE WILL FOR CRIMINAL IS

02:14:12.144 --> 02:14:13.945
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:14.780
PROVE FOR MOST WORKPLACE

02:14:14.846 --> 02:14:17.015
VIOLATIONS- IF YOU'RE OPEN TO

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:18.617
AMENDING THAT IN WAYS THAT

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.186
FEW COMMENTS AND I'M NOT A

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:56.188
LAWYER BUT I THINK THAT HE GOT

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:58.156
TO THE POINT OF THAT I THINK IS

02:14:58.223 --> 02:14:59.825
IMPORTANT AND THAT NEEDS TO

02:14:59.891 --> 02:15:01.827
HAVE A DEEPER DIVE BUT I

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:04.062
UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A CAUCUS OF

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:06.598
THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN OUR

02:15:06.665 --> 02:15:08.266
LEGISLATURE SINCE WE HIT THE

02:15:08.333 --> 02:15:10.235
PANDEMIC IN MANY BUMPS IN THE

02:15:10.302 --> 02:15:10.936

ON THE TOP OF THEIR AGENDA

02:15:19.578 --> 02:15:21.813
BECAUSE IT. SETS FORTH I THINK

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:25.217
OF THE PLANET WHERE WE CAN TAKE

02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:25.650
A CLOSER LOOK AT OUR

02:15:25.717 --> 02:15:46.404
