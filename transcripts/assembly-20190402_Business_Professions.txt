DAVID QUACKENBUSH FROM THE CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVING TO WIN THIS IS OUR SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD WARNING TURN MEMBERS MEGAN ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND WILL SEE ME DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WE ARE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS IT CURRENTLY MANDATES THAT A POSITION OFFER A REFERRAL. TO A SERVICE THAT IS LIKELY NOT COVERED BY THEIR INSURANCE PLAN. WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN PART OF THOSE FAR AND SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS IN TRYING TO ENSURE PATIENTS ARE OFFERED A TREATMENT PLAN. THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL APPROPRIATE OPTIONS FOR PAIN RELIEF. WE DO HOWEVER BELIEVE THE SCHOOL COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE WAY BY ENSURING THAT THESE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE THIS WOULD ADD PROVIDERS OF SERVICES SUCH AS CHIROPRACTIC AND ACUPUNCTURE. TO THE INSURANCE NETWORKS AND REFER ALSO BE POSSIBLE AS A PHYSICIAN WOULD HAVE A WAY TO KNOW WHO THEY COULD REFER TO THE PATIENT TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD BE COVERED VISIT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS CONSIDERATION OF OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SPEAKERS OPPOSITION. SEE NUMBER THERE'S THE COMMITTEE IN COMMITTEE MEMBER COME QUESTIONS STRONG. SO I WANT TO JUST AS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS WHOLE FOR OUR CAUCUS HAS -- OUR COMMITTEE HAS A NON ON I WILL BE SUPPORTING A BILL TODAY I ACTUALLY -- PERSONALLY -- I HAVE I HAVE A BOLD DISK AND THEY WANTED TO DO SURGERY AND BY DOING PHYSICAL THERAPY AND AND ACUPUNCTURE THOSE THINGS I WAS ABLE TO STAVE OFF THAT SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS BILL FOR TO BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU.

I I I SYMPATHIZE WITH MISS DOLLARS REBELDES DESK BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO BEEN AND IT IN AND HAD A LOT OF TIME IN DOCTOR'S OFFICES WITH -- WITH FAMILY MEMBERS -- IN HAVE HAD TO TRAVERSE THE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF INSURANCE AND WHAT'S COVERED AND WHAT'S NOT COVERED. I CAN ALSO SPEAK AS A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WOULD CARE GIVER -- WHO'S HAD TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AND SO I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT BEING THAT A REFERRAL MUST BE OFFERED -- IN IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE IF YOU OFFER PEOPLE A PLETHORA OF THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT THE ISSUES AND LET A PATIENT MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION. BECAUSE I THINK OFFERING THAT REFERRAL TO SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE IS PROBLEMATIC SO I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS GOING FORWARD. NOT EVERYTHING IS COVERED AND NOT ALL THINGS ARE EQUAL IN THE WORLD OF INSURANCE. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CENA REQUEST MISTER LO JACK CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AND APPRECIATING KNOWLEDGE THE SIMILAR TYPE OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND RESPECT FAST FIVE OAKLAND.

DISPENSING PHARMACY LICENSES FOR SPECIFICALLY TO CONNECT A LICENSED PHARMACIST TO PATIENTS IT MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS USING TELEPHONE MISSY TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH HOWEVER ALTHOUGH FOR AB FOR ONE IS NO LAW THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY LICENSES ISSUED. AND THEREFORE TELL PHARMACY IS STILL NOT READ A REALITY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE LAW WAS DEVELOPED THE BOARD OF PHARMACY WAS TASKED WITH DEVELOPING REGULATIONS TO SET THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL TRAINING NECESSARY. FOR A PHARMACY TECHNICIAN TO WORK AT A REMOTE DESCENT DISPENSING SITE. TO DATE THE RULE MAKING PROCESS TO THESE REGULATIONS HAS STALLED. AND COULD TAKE ANOTHER TWO YEARS OR MORE. INSTEAD SIX NINETY CODIFIES THE ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR PHARMACY TECHNICIAN TO BE ELIGIBLE TO WORK IN A REMOTE DISPENSING PHARMACY WHICH WILL ALLOW THESE FACILITIES AS FAR THESE FACILITIES FINALLY BE BECOME LICENSE. THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE BOARD OF PHARMACY'S DRAFT REGULATIONS ON THIS ISSUE.

WE ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO INDEPENDENT PHARMACY SO THAT THEY CAN EXPAND AND GROW THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESSES AND TELL THE PHARMACY IS ONE OF THOSE. OPTIONS THAT WE PROVIDE -- THIS BILL WILL HELP REALIZE THE GOALS OF AB FOR A ONE BY TAKING THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE BOARD OF PHARMACY OVER A YEAR AGO.

AS THE ONLY PIECE QUESTION IS THE ONE I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA FOR OFFERING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL FOR US -- CURRENT REGULATIONS DO NOT ALLOW ELLIE PEAS TO PROVIDE. SUPERVISION TO OTHER BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES ASSOCIATES OR PROFESSIONAL WHO WERE PROFESSIONALS BEING HOURS TOWARDS RELATIONSHIP. MANY OF THESE TVS ASSOCIATES ON PORTS BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR WORK IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. PRIVATE PRACTICES THAT PROVIDE EDUCATION RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PRIVATE PRACTICES HAVE TO EMPLOY OTHER BBS LICENSEES TO PROVIDE SUPERVISION FOR THE ASSOCIATES EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS THEY RELATE TO EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONING IN ONE INSTANCE WE HAD TO BE B. S. ASSOCIATES WHO WERE PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS IN A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN ALLEY P. THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR HOURS WOULD COUNT TOWARDS LICENSURE BUT WERE DENIED THE ENTIRE YEARS WORK WHICH WAS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED HOURS. BECAUSE THE SUPERVISION WAS PROVIDED BY NELLY P. WE'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THIS AND ALLOW ELLIE PEAS TO PROVIDE SUPERVISION TO OTHER BBS ASSOCIATES WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICES WITHIN OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. IN EDUCATIONAL AND CLINICAL SETTINGS THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BBS ASSOCIATES TO WORK TOWARDS THEIR NEEDED HOURS FOR LICENSURE.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO RESENT HOWEVER YOU WISH THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM. PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WILL UPDATE THE LIMITS ON LOANS THAT MORTGAGE BROKERS CAN SECURE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PROJECTS. TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT CURRENT PROPERTY VALUES AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS THIS BILL IS ABOUT MORE HOUSING MISTER CHAIR. MORTGAGE BROKERS ARE LICENSED REAL ESTATE BROKERS WHO ARRANGE LOANS USING REAL PROPERTY AS COLLATERAL. THESE BROKERS BRING TOGETHER PRIVATE LENDERS AND BORROWERS TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO PURCHASE A WIDE ARRAY OF PROPERTIES INCLUDING SINGLE FAMILY HOMES COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. APARTMENT COMPLEXES AND MANY OTHERS. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LOAN RULES THE LEGISLATURE CREATED A NEW LONG CATEGORY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION LOANS. THIS NEW CATEGORY WOULD ALLOW BROKERS TO FACTOR IN THE ADDED PROPERTY VALUE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIRS WHEN DETERMINING. THE SIZE OF A LOAN. TO PREVENT ABUSE OF THIS FLEXIBILITY SEVERAL NEW RULES WERE CREATED TO PROTECT BORROWERS AND LENDERS FROM ADDITIONAL RISK. ONE OF THESE ROLES WAS A TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT ON THE SIZE ALONE THAT'S THE LIMIT TODAY. THIS LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE IT WENT INTO EFFECT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. SINCE THEN INFLATION AND RISING PROPERTY VALUES HAVE DRAMATICALLY DRAWING UP THE COST OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS AROSE REHABILITATION COSTS. IN A TIME WHEN NEW HOUSING IS DESPERATELY NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING DEL DEVELOPERS WITH MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO FINANCE ARE PROJECTS. NOT FEWER THIS BILL DOES THAT AB -- THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR MY CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION LOANS A VIABLE OPTION FOR DEVELOPERS AGAIN BY INCREASING THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD TO FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.
