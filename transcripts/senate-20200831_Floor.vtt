APPOINTED- COUNCIL- ROSTER WHAT

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.972

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.414
COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:19.016

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:25.022
TURNING NOW WITH SCOTT PETERSON

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.390

EIGHTEEN TO MAKE SURE THEY

MADAM CHAIR I STAND IN SUPPORT

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.847
OF SB TWO ZERO THREE I THINK

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:51.682
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF RESOURCES

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.584
ARE WITH REGARD TO IF ATTORNEY

IF WE HAVE TO AUGMENT PUBLIC

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:56.654
COUNCIL I THINK THE ISSUE

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.423
REALLY IS. TECHNOLOGY THE FACT

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.325
THAT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF

00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:02.726
EIGHTEEN AS THE AUTHOR SAID

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.495
MOST ADULTS DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:05.663
FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT IT MEANS TO

00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:09.133
CALL WAVE ONE'S RIGHTS AND SOUL

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.202

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.712
BILL IS SAYING IS. THAT THEY

BEFORE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:25.749
WAIVE A RIGHT I DON'T THINK

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.184
IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE NEED OF

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:29.286
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IF THEY

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:31.288

ABSOLUTE STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS

ARE. SO THE BENEFIT OF HAVING

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:26.930
THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:34.604
THAT YOU KNOW I. I UNDERSTAND

I'M NOT AGAINST BIKE LANES IT'S

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:41.178
HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE. OTHERS

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:41.712
AN EXEMPTION IT APPLIES OF

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:42.713
ITSELF OVER HOW MILLION. WHAT

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.448
WITH THE BIKE LANE BEAT WOULD

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:45.515
COST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:47.617
IS BEYOND ME SO BASICALLY

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:49.252
EVERYTHING GETS IN AND THE

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:52.222
DECISION MAKERS. ARE DENIED

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:55.459
THAT. THAT INFORMATION THAT

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:56.893
OPENNESS THAT THE PUBLIC IS

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.762
THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:00.697
UNDERSEA COOPER WOULD YOU SAY

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.366
YOU HAVE A CATEGORY EXEMPTION

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:04.568
THERE'S ALREADY STREAMLINING

00:50:04.634 --> 00:50:07.604
THAT GOES INTO THIS. THIS FIVE

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.172
OUR SYSTEM IF YOU WANT TO

00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:11.208
EXPAND THAT CATEGORY EXEMPTION

00:50:11.274 --> 00:50:12.542
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING BUT

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:13.276
YOU WHEN YOU SWITCH IT TO A

00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:17.681
STATUTORY IT'S A NO LOOK. I GET

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:19.049
THAT IT'S LIMITED BECAUSE THIS

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.886
IN RIGHT AWAY. AS I GET THAT IT

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:23.453
YOU KNOW IT'S BY PLANE IT'S

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.087
APPLE AND ALL THESE THINGS BUT

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:26.123
I JUST REALLY HAVE A CONCERN

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:27.991
THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:29.226
STUCK WITH THIS COVERT

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:31.395
SITUATION THIS IS A- DEMOCRAT

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.529
IS A DIFFERENT BILL THAT LEFT

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:34.364
THE FLOOR ONE HERE AND WE

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:38.301
HAVEN'T HAD. THAT OPPORTUNITY

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:39.503
TO DEVELOP IT AND THERE'S

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:40.670
ANOTHER BILL THE CHAIRMAN OF

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:43.540
THE BUT IT THE CHAIR OF THE D.

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:45.542
Q. IS HAVING A SIMILAR BILL

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.444
THAT LOOKS IT FIXED RAIL AND

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:50.046
RIDE WAYS THAT. THE NEW ONES

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:50.914
THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:53.950
HAD WOULD HAVE BEEN HEALTH. A

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:55.819
THIS TIME I LOVE MY BIKE PEOPLE

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:58.755
I LOVE THE SMART STREETS AND

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:00.590
ALL THE AND ALL THE APPLE PIE.

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:05.195
BUT I STILL. I AM HESITANT AND-

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:07.531
CONCERNED ABOUT SWITCHING IT TO

00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:10.534
STATUTORY EXEMPTION. THANK YOU

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.903
SENATOR Y. CASKEY ANY FURTHER

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:13.737
DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:16.206
FLOOR SEEING NONE WILL GO TO A

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:17.974
REMOTE PARTICIPANTS SENATOR

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:24.781
BORDERS. YESTERDAY WE HAD A

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:27.517
ROBUST DISCUSSION ON. SYKORA

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:31.655
AND THEN APPARENTLY- IT'S

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.423
BLEEDING OVER INTO TODAY AS

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:37.127
WELL- I THINK THAT THIS IS

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:40.764
PROBABLY A WELL THOUGHT THROUGH.

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:45.969
WAY ABOVE ALLOWING. FOR MAJOR

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:49.272
PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.507
ESPECIALLY IN A CORPORATE

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.676
ENVIRONMENT BUT I DO HAVE TO

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:56.613
KIND OF SPARKING BACK. WHY HE

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.684
SAID THAT WE NEED EXEMPTIONS.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.118
WHY DO WE NEED CARVE OUTS FROM

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:04.120
SEQUEL UNLESS WE HAVE TO

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:07.057
IMPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:52:07.123 --> 00:52:08.892
SEAT ONE IS. YOUR OWN

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:12.963
BURDENSOME IT CAN EASILY LEAD

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:15.632
TO LITIGATION AND CREATE

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.501
EXTRAORDINARY DIFFICULTY IN OUR

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.503
PROJECT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY FOR

00:52:19.569 --> 00:52:22.372
THE PUBLIC GOOD. SO I THINK WE

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:23.540
HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR TAKE

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.642
A HARD LOOK AND HAVE THE

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.077
POLITICAL WILL ENCOURAGE TO

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.712
KNOWLEDGE WE WOULDN'T BE

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:31.982
SEEKING EXEMPTIONS IF SEEK WHAT

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:34.217
WAS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. IT'S

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.720
NOT. AND I THINK THIS IS A

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:40.991
PERFECT EXAMPLE. OF PROJECTS

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:43.260
FOR A SERIES OF PROJECTS THAT

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:46.329
WOULD QUALIFY AND THE FACT THAT

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:48.298
PEOPLE SEE THAT STREAMLINING IS

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:50.100
AVAILABLE AND SEEK WORK WHAT A

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.902
JOKE. ANYBODY WHO SPEND ANY

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:54.571
TIME IN LOCAL POLITICS AT THE

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.373
CITY LEVEL COUNTY LEVEL

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:57.974
PLANNING COMMISSION LEVEL THEY

00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:00.310
KNOW THAT THERE'S REALLY NO

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:02.312
SUCH THING. AS A FAST

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:04.748
EFFICIENCY WILL PROCESS IN

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.383
STREAMLINING IS IT SIMPLY A

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:08.818
DESCRIPTOR THAT WE USE TO MAKE

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.053
OURSELVES FEEL GOOD THAT THERE

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.488
CAN BE A FAST TRACK THERE IS NO

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:14.758
FASTRACK. SO I THINK IF WE HAVE

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:17.527
THE COURAGE IN THE NEXT CYCLE.

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.496
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE ADEQUACY

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:22.365
OR INADEQUACY OF SEQUEL- I

00:53:22.432 --> 00:53:24.167
THINK CALIFORNIA BE BETTER OFF

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:29.239
FOR IT I. WILL BE SUPPORTING

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:29.873
THE STAFFORD TODAY. ANY FURTHER

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.241
DEBATE OR JUST ON THE BILL IS

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:32.409
THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:36.246
DISCUSSION ON THE BILL. SEEING

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:38.181
I'M SORRY WE HAVE SENATOR BATES

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:42.886
CENTER BATES. THANK YOU MADAM

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:44.521
PRESIDENT I JUST NEED TO WAIT

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:46.856
AGAIN- MY CONTINUALLY VOTE

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:49.426
AGAINST THE BILL STATUS REDUCE

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:52.095
A PARKING- WE PASSED A BILL I

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.029
BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:54.798
ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:57.100
ELECTRIC VEHICLES PEOPLE HAVE

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:58.868
CARS AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.971
A PLACE TO PARK THEM PREFERABLY

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.305
NOT ON THE STREETS THAT

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:04.441
SURROUND THESE HOUSING AREAS.

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.676
BECAUSE THAT IS CLEARLY A

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:07.944
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THAT I HAVE

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:09.879
BROUGHT UP CONTINUALLY BASED ON

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:11.047
THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN MY

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:13.183
DISTRICT WITH CHILDREN MOVING

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:14.818
BETWEEN PARKED CARS SINCE

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:17.020
GETTING HURT OR IN A COUPLE

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:19.489
CASES LOSING THEIR LIVES SO I

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:21.591
REDUCING PARKING IS NOT THE WAY

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.526
TO GO OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:25.328
GOING TO HAVE CARS AND WE NEED

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:27.564
TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. SO BE IT

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:29.666
BASED ON THAT I WILL CONTINUE

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.234
TO REGISTER AND NOBLE INTO WE

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:33.203
HAVE A MORE LOGICAL APPROACH

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:36.239
WHAT WE DO WITH OUR CARS

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:37.507
BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF OUR

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:38.908
LIVES AND CERTAINLY IN MANY

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.877
AREAS AND MORE THE OUTLYING

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.412
AREAS YOU YOU'RE GONNA NEED A

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:44.848
CAR SO WITH THAT I WILL HAVE TO

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:46.282
AGAIN OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:51.454
YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES.

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:55.492
SAN DURO I HAD THE CONGRESS

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.993
WITH THE SENATOR FROM SAN

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.362
FRANCISCO BOB PRIMARILY MY

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:00.397
CONCERN AND I THINK

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.032
ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:04.034
CONCERN IS WE HAVE HISTORICALLY

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.971
BEEN EXCLUDED FROM PROCESSES-

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.706
NOT TECHNICALLY BUT DE FACTO

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:12.042
AND SO THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:14.511
I RAISED ABOUT HOW DO OUR

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:17.847
COMMUNITIES HAVE THE VOICE AND

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:20.817
HAVE THE ABILITY TO REALLY

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:23.019
IMPACT THE DECISIONS MADE IN

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:26.356
OUR COMMUNITIES- SOME OF THE

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:29.125
THINGS. THAT WERE TOLD TO ME IS

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:30.427
THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:32.429
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.930
COMMITTEES TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:36.666
A VOICE AND REALLY IMPACT THE

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:39.269
OUTCOMES- AND ALSO THAT THIS IS

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:42.772
A PILOT- OF PILOT PROGRAM SO-

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:45.275
WITH THAT I WILL- SUPPORT TODAY

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:49.913
BUT- I THINK THE OVERALL. IT UP

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.981
ON EASY IN THIS IS ABOUT HOW

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:55.151
DOES THIS BREAK INTO OF THE

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.152
OPPORTUNITIES OF OUR

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:59.823
COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A REAL

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.324
VOICE ON THE GROUND THANK YOU.

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:02.425
ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:04.027
DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING

AND I APPRECIATE THE DEBATE.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.936
THE BIKE LANE EXEMPTION IS AN

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:15.271
EXISTING EXEMPTION WERE SIMPLY

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:17.273
IT'S EXTENDING ITS A PLACE. FOR

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.509
A WHILE LARGE PROJECTS WILL

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:20.510
HAVE TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:22.312
CLEARED FIVE THROUGH REGIONAL

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.847
TRANSPORTATION PLAN DOUBTS THAT

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:24.948

02:34:43.707 --> 02:34:46.477
BUDGET BILLS THAT GO THROUGH.

02:34:46.543 --> 02:34:47.811
GOING TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY

02:34:47.878 --> 02:34:49.113
TO RELEASE THESE PEOPLE INTO

02:34:49.179 --> 02:34:50.814
THE POPULATION IN INTO OUR

02:34:50.881 --> 02:34:52.650
COMMUNITIES. BUT WE NEED TO

02:34:52.716 --> 02:34:53.717
FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO

02:34:53.784 --> 02:34:55.052
SAVE THE STATE MONEY I REALIZE

02:34:55.119 --> 02:34:56.120
THAT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO

02:34:56.186 --> 02:34:57.588
KEEP PEOPLE IN PRISON. BUT

02:34:57.655 --> 02:34:58.889
THESE PEOPLE ARE IN PRISON

02:34:58.956 --> 02:35:00.691
TRIED BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS

02:35:00.758 --> 02:35:02.059

02:35:02.126 --> 02:35:03.260
REASON AND I WANT YOU TO TRY TO

THAT WILL BE- ASSAULTED AGAIN

02:35:08.298 --> 02:35:10.034
WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE RELEASED I

SEEMINGLY POPULAR TO. THROWN

02:35:41.965 --> 02:35:45.302
AROUND VERY INACCURATE AND

02:35:45.369 --> 02:35:48.105
SENSATIONAL STATISTICS ABOUT

02:35:48.172 --> 02:35:52.176
VIOLENT CRIME WE'RE HEARING IT

02:35:52.242 --> 02:35:54.078
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN

02:35:54.144 --> 02:35:57.181
ACTUALLY VIOLENT CRIME IS DOWN

02:35:57.247 --> 02:36:01.919
IT IS ALSO SEEMINGLY- POPULAR

02:36:01.985 --> 02:36:04.621
TO MAKE REFERENCES TO THINGS

02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:05.823
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

02:36:05.889 --> 02:36:08.058
THE BILL BEFORE US SO LET ME

02:36:08.125 --> 02:36:10.694
CLARIFY WHAT IS IN THE BILL

02:36:10.761 --> 02:36:12.830
BEFORE US WHAT IS IN THE BILL

02:36:12.896 --> 02:36:16.900
BEFORE US. IS NOT A STATE

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:20.938
MANDATE IT IS. A ABILITY FOR A

02:36:21.004 --> 02:36:24.808
COURT. IF I COUNTY APPROVES IT

02:36:24.875 --> 02:36:26.744
FOR COURT TO BE ABLE TO

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:29.513
ESTABLISH A MISDEMEANOR

02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:33.417
DIVERSION PROGRAM AND EVEN WITH

02:36:33.484 --> 02:36:35.085
IN THAT MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION.

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:37.287
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CRIMES

02:36:37.354 --> 02:36:41.325
THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED. SO IT

02:36:41.391 --> 02:36:44.495
DOES NOT ALLOW FOR. POLICIES ON

02:36:44.561 --> 02:36:46.764
JUST LOOKING AT MY NOTES. IT

02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:49.066
DOES NOT ALLOW FOR SEX OFFENSES

02:36:49.133 --> 02:36:50.901
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A WHOLE

02:36:50.968 --> 02:36:52.803
VARIETY OF AND OF COURSE

02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:54.671
REMEMBER NOW REFERRING TO

02:36:54.738 --> 02:36:55.272
MISDEMEANOR SO THESE WOULD BE

02:36:55.339 --> 02:36:57.841
MISDEMEANOR. SEX OFFENSES AND

02:36:57.908 --> 02:37:00.410
MISDEMEANORS- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:01.779
AND STALKING BUT THOSE ARE

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:04.882
EXCLUDED SO THIS IS PURELY

02:37:04.948 --> 02:37:07.584
OPTIONAL FOR FOURTEEN COUNTIES

02:37:07.651 --> 02:37:09.853
IF THEY SO CHOOSE AND IT'S

02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:12.289
BASED ON A VERY SUCCESSFUL

02:37:12.356 --> 02:37:13.757
DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN

02:37:13.824 --> 02:37:15.626
OPERATING IN L. A. COUNTY FOR A

02:37:15.692 --> 02:37:17.261
NUMBER OF YEARS THAT'S FIRST

02:37:17.327 --> 02:37:18.829
AND FOREMOST THAT'S THE

02:37:18.896 --> 02:37:20.330
DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT'S IN

02:37:20.397 --> 02:37:22.232
THIS BILL IT IS NOT A MANDATE.

02:37:22.299 --> 02:37:24.368
IT IS NOT A AUTHORIZING THE

02:37:24.434 --> 02:37:26.904
STATE WIDE IT IS ALLOWING

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:28.872
COUNTIES IF THEY SO CHOOSE AND

02:37:28.939 --> 02:37:31.008
COURTS THE SECOND COMPONENT OF

02:37:31.074 --> 02:37:34.778
THIS BILL THE SECOND COMPONENT

02:37:34.845 --> 02:37:37.447
OF THIS BILL. IS THE NEXT DATE

02:37:37.514 --> 02:37:39.917
REVISION TO THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:42.619
OWN APPROVED STATUTE AROUND

02:37:42.686 --> 02:37:45.656
MEDICAL PAROLE. NOW FOR MEDICAL

02:37:45.722 --> 02:37:50.260
PAROLE STATUTE REQUIRES IF. E.

02:37:50.327 --> 02:37:53.931
CDCR. RECOMMENDS AND OF COURSE

02:37:53.997 --> 02:37:57.167
THIS REQUIRES CDCR TO RECOMMEND

02:37:57.234 --> 02:37:58.035
AN INDIVIDUAL FOR MEDICAL

02:37:58.101 --> 02:38:00.537
PAROLE THAT INDIVIDUAL STILL

02:38:00.604 --> 02:38:01.672
MUST GO BEFORE THE PAROLE

02:38:01.738 --> 02:38:03.574
BOARD. SO THIS HAS NOTHING TO

02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:06.777
DO WITH THE RELEASES THAT THE

02:38:06.844 --> 02:38:08.946
GOVERNOR RECENTLY ALLOWED YOU

02:38:09.012 --> 02:38:10.981
TO COBIT AND THOSE RELEASES

02:38:11.048 --> 02:38:14.218
MORE. EXCLUDED TO PEOPLE WHO

02:38:14.284 --> 02:38:17.988
WERE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF RELEASE.

02:38:18.055 --> 02:38:20.424
AND THE GOVERNOR HAS DIFFERENT

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:25.095
AUTHORITIES FOR SUCH- RELEASES

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:27.064
THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THOSE

02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:30.734
THIS BILL ONLY REVISES OUR OWN

02:38:30.801 --> 02:38:33.437
STATUTE WHERE A PERSON AN

02:38:33.503 --> 02:38:35.639
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL IF THEY

02:38:35.706 --> 02:38:37.941
ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE PRISON

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:40.077
SYSTEM TO BE CONSIDERED FOR

02:38:40.143 --> 02:38:42.079
MEDICAL PAROLE THEY WOULD STILL

02:38:42.145 --> 02:38:43.714
HAVE TO GO BEFORE THE PROBOARDS

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:45.916
PROBOARDS WOULD STILL REVIEW IT

02:38:45.983 --> 02:38:47.317
VICTIMS WOULD BE ABLE TO COME

02:38:47.384 --> 02:38:49.286
FORWARD. JUDGES D. A.'S COULD

02:38:49.353 --> 02:38:51.822
WEIGH IN AND IF WE LOOK

02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:54.424
HISTORICALLY OVER THE TEN SAY

02:38:54.491 --> 02:38:56.760
ODD YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD SUCH

02:38:56.827 --> 02:38:59.196
MEDICAL PAROLE THERE HAVE BEEN

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:01.064
VERY VERY FEW. FOR INCARCERATED

02:39:01.131 --> 02:39:02.866
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

02:39:02.933 --> 02:39:05.068
SUCCESSFULLY BEEN GIVEN MEDICAL

02:39:05.135 --> 02:39:07.537
PAROLE SO THAT IS WHAT'S IN THE

02:39:07.604 --> 02:39:09.973
BILL AND I WANTED TO BE VERY

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:13.377
CLEAR. SO THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY

02:39:13.443 --> 02:39:17.781
WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON THANK YOU.

02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:20.083

VERY MUCH- THIS IS NOT A

02:39:27.991 --> 02:39:31.361
POPULARITY CONTEST SO- LET'S

02:39:31.428 --> 02:39:32.796
TALK ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN

02:39:32.863 --> 02:39:35.065
THE JAIL THIS BILL ALLOWS A

02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:37.634
JUDGE TO PROVIDE UNLIMITED

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:40.270
DIVERSION FOR ANY MISDEMEANOR

02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:42.239
WITH THE EXCLUSION OF SEX

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:44.141
OFFENSES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND

02:39:44.207 --> 02:39:49.112
STALKING. IT DOES ALLOW FOR-

02:39:49.179 --> 02:39:54.584
pCHILD ABUSE D. Y. HATE CRIMES

02:39:54.651 --> 02:39:56.219
BRINGING A FIREARM INTO A

02:39:56.286 --> 02:39:57.654
LEGISLATIVE OFFICE ASSAULT

02:39:57.721 --> 02:39:59.523
BATTERY IDENTITY THEFT VEHICLE

02:39:59.589 --> 02:40:01.291
VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER

02:40:01.358 --> 02:40:04.094
POSSESSING A FIREARM- UPON OR

02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:05.862
WITHIN PUBLIC SCHOOL IN ON THE

02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:07.698
GROUNDS ALL ELIGIBLE FOR

02:40:07.764 --> 02:40:09.466
DIVERSION IT SOUNDS LIKE A REAL

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:11.768
NICE BUNCH DOESN'T IT. THIS IS

02:40:11.835 --> 02:40:13.971
RIDICULOUS EVERY TIME WE HAVE A

02:40:14.037 --> 02:40:15.605
BILL THAT COMES UP LIKE THIS

02:40:15.672 --> 02:40:17.140
IT'S MADE OUT TO BE THAT I

02:40:17.207 --> 02:40:18.742
WOULD SUGGEST THESE LOW LEVEL

02:40:18.809 --> 02:40:21.845
OFFENDERS WHAT'S THE HARM. IF

02:40:21.912 --> 02:40:23.680
YOU LISTENED TO THE COMMENTS OF

02:40:23.747 --> 02:40:25.282
THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IF YOU

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:26.850
ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM YOU

02:40:26.917 --> 02:40:28.919
WOULD HEAR THE TYPE OF HARM.

02:40:28.986 --> 02:40:31.054
THAT MAY BE BECAUSE THIS THIS

02:40:31.121 --> 02:40:32.789
IS SO INAPPROPRIATE AND TO GO

02:40:32.856 --> 02:40:35.726
FURTHER WITH RESPECT TO THE

02:40:35.792 --> 02:40:37.828
ELDERLY PAROLE PROGRAM. CAROLI

02:40:37.894 --> 02:40:39.463
AGREE JUST BY THE WAY. YOU

02:40:39.529 --> 02:40:40.831
TARGET INMATES WHO HAVE

02:40:40.897 --> 02:40:42.232
COMMITTED THE MOST VIOLENT AND

02:40:42.299 --> 02:40:43.633
TROUBLING CRIME SO THEIR SO

02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:45.769
CALLED NON VIOLENCE AND THESE

02:40:45.836 --> 02:40:47.137
ARE IN MAJOR BORROWER RECEIVED

02:40:47.204 --> 02:40:48.972
EXPEDITED PAROLE HEARINGS BY

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:50.874
THE WAY UNDER PROP SIXTY SEVEN.

02:40:50.941 --> 02:40:52.209
AND THREE STRIKES INMATES ARE

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:53.877
EXEMPTED SO YOU'RE GOING TO

02:40:53.944 --> 02:40:55.746
HAVE THERESULT OF REDUCED

02:40:55.812 --> 02:40:56.813
SENTENCES FOR CRIMES LIKE

02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:59.950
MURDER KIDNAPPING RAPE AND SO

02:41:00.017 --> 02:41:04.287
ON AND SO FORTH THIS IS. IT GOD

HELP US YOU KNOW IF WE CONTINUE

02:41:05.989 --> 02:41:07.424
WITH BILLS LIKE THIS BECAUSE

02:41:07.491 --> 02:41:08.725
AND BY THE WAY I DON'T THINK

02:41:08.792 --> 02:41:10.427
LOS ANGELES SHOULD REALLY BE

02:41:10.494 --> 02:41:13.363
HELD UP AS THE LITMUS TEST OR

02:41:13.430 --> 02:41:15.399
BENCHMARK FOR HELPING SHOULD BE

02:41:15.465 --> 02:41:17.367
DONE PROPERLY GIVEN WHAT'S

02:41:17.434 --> 02:41:19.569
GOING ON THERE SO I.

02:41:19.636 --> 02:41:21.071
WHOLEHEARTEDLY ASK FOR YOUR NO

02:41:21.138 --> 02:41:24.074
BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:41:24.141 --> 02:41:32.249
SENATOR BORCHERS. I'M TRYING TO

02:41:32.315 --> 02:41:37.020
UNDERSTAND THE TITLE OF THIS

02:41:37.087 --> 02:41:44.161
pWAS SIXTEEN AND HAS NOW BEEN

02:41:44.227 --> 02:41:47.030
REDUCED DOWN TO FIFTY. SO WHAT

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:49.332
OCCURRED TO ME IS IT SEEMS LIKE

02:41:49.399 --> 02:41:52.402
THERE'S A DUAL PURPOSE JUNE

02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:56.006
LEGISLATION. ONE IT HAS ON

02:41:56.073 --> 02:41:58.208
CERTAINLY HAS A SOCIAL CRIMINAL

02:41:58.275 --> 02:42:00.143
JUSTICE REFORM ELEMENT TO IT.

02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:04.014
BUT THE SECOND. WAS THE ELDERLY

02:42:04.081 --> 02:42:08.151
PAROLE PROGRAM. WAIT FOR THE

02:42:08.218 --> 02:42:11.054
STATE TO NOT HAVE TO SHOULDER

02:42:11.121 --> 02:42:13.457
THE MEDICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:42:13.523 --> 02:42:17.861
WITH AGING INMATES. I'M

02:42:17.928 --> 02:42:19.729
WONDERING IF THAT HAS A

02:42:19.796 --> 02:42:21.631
SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT TO THIS

02:42:21.698 --> 02:42:25.268
CALCULATION. THAT CALIFORNIA

02:42:25.335 --> 02:42:28.238
WOULD SAVE MONEY BY GETTING RID

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:32.876
OF FOLKS THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE.

02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:36.413
ACTUARIALLY MORE EXPOSED AND IN

02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:39.349
NEED OF MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE

02:42:39.416 --> 02:42:42.452
REASON I BRING IT UP IS THAT IF

02:42:42.519 --> 02:42:44.621
THERE'S A COST FACTOR TO THIS.

02:42:44.688 --> 02:42:46.022
IN ADDITION TO THE SOCIAL

02:42:46.089 --> 02:42:47.057
ARGUMENT THAT I MENTIONED

02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:48.358
EARLIER THAT THERE'S A COST

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:50.460
FACTOR HERE. IS NOT WHAT WE'RE

02:42:50.527 --> 02:42:53.430
SUPPOSED TO DO. IF PEOPLE ARE

02:42:53.497 --> 02:42:54.764
HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES TO PAYING

02:42:54.831 --> 02:42:56.733
THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY. WE ALSO

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.835
HAVE TO MAKE THEIR- LIVING

02:42:58.902 --> 02:43:03.039
ENVIRONMENT- HABITABLE ON WE

02:43:03.106 --> 02:43:05.075
HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH WITH.

02:43:05.142 --> 02:43:07.410
BASICS OF MEDICAL ATTENTION SO

02:43:07.477 --> 02:43:09.980
ON AND SO FORTH. SO I GUESS I

02:43:10.046 --> 02:43:11.681
BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I DON'T

02:43:11.748 --> 02:43:13.216
WANT TO BE CYNICAL ABOUT IT BUT

02:43:13.283 --> 02:43:15.018
IS THIS MOSTLY JUST A COST

02:43:15.085 --> 02:43:16.686
SAVING AFTER THAT THE

02:43:16.753 --> 02:43:19.756
RHETORICALLY NOT EXPECTING- THE

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:22.592
FLOOR MANAGER TO RESPOND BUT-

02:43:22.659 --> 02:43:24.194
IF THAT IS THE CASE I THINK

02:43:24.261 --> 02:43:27.998
IT'S TROUBLING BECAUSE. PEOPLE

02:43:28.064 --> 02:43:29.633
WHO HAVE A DEBT TO SOCIETY.

02:43:29.699 --> 02:43:33.203
STILL HAVE. YET EVEN THOUGH

02:43:33.270 --> 02:43:35.038
THEY'RE OUT OF PRISON AND IN MY

02:43:35.105 --> 02:43:38.241
OPINION. BECAUSE IT FOR LOCAL

02:43:38.308 --> 02:43:40.377
OUT FOR THESE EXTERNALITIES

02:43:40.443 --> 02:43:43.780
EXPONENTIAL EXTERNALITIES. THEN

02:43:43.847 --> 02:43:46.283
WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE ON

02:43:46.349 --> 02:43:48.718
THAT IF YOU'RE TOO COSTLY WE

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:51.021
WILL SHED YOU FROM THE RANKS

02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:55.659
AND THAT I THINK IS POOR POLICY.

02:43:55.725 --> 02:43:57.394
THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR

02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:00.297
DISCUSSION SEEING NO HANDS UP

02:44:00.363 --> 02:44:02.566
REMOTELY ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR

02:44:02.632 --> 02:44:04.768
DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. SEEING

02:44:04.834 --> 02:44:06.870
AND HEARING NONE SENATOR

02:44:06.937 --> 02:44:19.716
MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK

02:44:19.783 --> 02:44:26.256
YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT.

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:27.457
BOB PRITCHETT ALL OF THE

02:44:27.524 --> 02:44:29.526
DISCUSSION AROUND THIS TRAILER

02:44:29.593 --> 02:44:31.494
BILL LET ME START WHICH IS

02:44:31.561 --> 02:44:33.029
PROVIDING SOME I THINK

02:44:33.096 --> 02:44:35.265
IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS- I

02:44:35.332 --> 02:44:38.835
THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND

02:44:38.902 --> 02:44:40.570
DANGEROUS WHEN WE START TO ON

02:44:40.637 --> 02:44:42.072
THIS FLOOR GIVE SPECIFIC

02:44:42.138 --> 02:44:44.274
EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC SPECIFIC

02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:47.477
CRIMES. BECAUSE WHILE ALL OF

02:44:47.544 --> 02:44:50.347
THOSE THINGS SOUND ABSOLUTELY

02:44:50.413 --> 02:44:51.081
HORRIFIC AND NONE OF US WOULD

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:53.984
WANT TO BE A VICTIM OF THAT

02:44:54.050 --> 02:44:55.085
NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO TAKE

02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:56.152
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE PEOPLE

02:44:56.219 --> 02:44:58.154
BEING RELEASED WE ALSO HAVE TO

02:44:58.221 --> 02:45:00.090
MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMENTS ARE

02:45:00.156 --> 02:45:03.860
RELEVANT. ACCURATE IN GERMANE

02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:06.429
TO THE BILLS BEFORE US. LET ME

02:45:06.496 --> 02:45:09.199
START BY SAYING THIS BUDGET THE

02:45:09.266 --> 02:45:10.100
TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET NOR THIS

02:45:10.166 --> 02:45:12.035
TRAILER BILL HAS TAKEN ANY

02:45:12.102 --> 02:45:14.738
ACTION TO QUOTE D. FUND THE

02:45:14.804 --> 02:45:15.272
POLICE THAT IS NOT IN THIS

02:45:15.338 --> 02:45:20.944
TRIBUTE. SECONDLY THE ARM.

02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:22.879
ACTIVE SERIOUS DISSUADING OF

02:45:22.946 --> 02:45:26.216
WITNESSES ARE FILED AS FELONIES

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:28.718
NOT MISDEMEANORS AND SELL THAT

02:45:28.785 --> 02:45:31.755
STORY WOULD NOT BE GERMANE TO

02:45:31.821 --> 02:45:34.024
THIS TRAILER BILL. POINT OF

02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:38.662
CLARIFICATION THERE HAVE BEEN

02:45:38.728 --> 02:45:39.195
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

02:45:39.262 --> 02:45:41.398
NINETY FIVE CDC ARE EMPLOYEES

02:45:41.464 --> 02:45:44.901
WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE. TEN

02:45:44.968 --> 02:45:45.535
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:45:45.602 --> 02:45:47.837
FOUR INMATES MANY MORE THAN

02:45:47.904 --> 02:45:49.939
JUST ONE HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED

02:45:50.006 --> 02:45:52.709
AND RAGICALLY WE'VE HAD FIFTY

02:45:52.776 --> 02:45:54.678
EIGHT INMATE DEATHS. AND I

02:45:54.744 --> 02:45:58.014
BELIEVE ONE OR TWO CVC ARE

02:45:58.081 --> 02:46:01.084
EMPLOYEE DEATH. AND SO FOR SOME

02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:03.653
PEOPLE PERHAPS NOT ALL WHO HAVE

02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:07.290
PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS COLBERT

02:46:07.357 --> 02:46:12.162
NINETEEN CAN LEAD TO DEATH. AND

02:46:12.228 --> 02:46:14.597
SERIOUS LONG TERM AND- WITH

02:46:14.664 --> 02:46:16.933
REGARD TO ELDERLY PAROLE- THIS

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.601
ISSUE HAS BEEN THE TOPIC OF

02:46:18.668 --> 02:46:20.737
NUMEROUS RESEARCH STUDY AND

02:46:20.804 --> 02:46:23.206
SEVERAL BILLS HEARD BEFORE THIS

02:46:23.273 --> 02:46:25.942
LEGISLATURE. THE JUDICIAL

02:46:26.009 --> 02:46:28.378
APPOINTED RECEIVER ALL UPDATES

02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:30.580
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND WILL

02:46:30.647 --> 02:46:31.114
UPDATE ANY MEMBER WHO WAS

02:46:31.181 --> 02:46:34.451
INTERESTED. ON WHAT HE SEES

02:46:34.517 --> 02:46:36.286
WHAT CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE

02:46:36.353 --> 02:46:39.055
WHY ARE HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE

02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:42.225
BEEN SO QUITE FRANKLY HIGH ON

02:46:42.292 --> 02:46:44.227
SINCE HE WAS APPOINTED MANY

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:46.596
YEARS AGO NOW. AND SO I THINK

02:46:46.663 --> 02:46:48.031
THE ISSUE OF ELLE THE ELDERLY

02:46:48.098 --> 02:46:50.333
PAROLE IS REALLY TWO FOLD YES

02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:51.901
IT'S COST SAVINGS BECAUSE IT'S

02:46:51.968 --> 02:46:54.270
ASTRONOMICAL WHAT WE ARE PAYING

02:46:54.337 --> 02:46:57.874
PARTICULARLY FOR. THE ELDERLY-

02:46:57.941 --> 02:47:00.677
IN MAY TO HAVE SERIOUS CHRONIC

02:47:00.744 --> 02:47:04.647
CONDITIONS. ON AN A PART OF THE

02:47:04.714 --> 02:47:06.516

DISCUSSION ON THIS MATTER IN

03:54:46.972 --> 03:54:49.408
JUDICIARY- I THINK THE FIRST

INITIAL ITERATION AND OBVIOUSLY

03:54:57.917 --> 03:54:59.919
MUCH SHORTER ONE. SO MY

03:54:59.985 --> 03:55:01.420
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

03:55:01.487 --> 03:55:03.355
HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF

UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION

03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:12.965
SOMEWHAT TOLERABLE AND I THINK

03:55:13.032 --> 03:55:15.167
THE FLOOR MANAGER SAID IT BEST

03:55:15.234 --> 03:55:17.736
THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL THE

03:55:17.803 --> 03:55:21.207
ISSUES. IN THE CONTINUUM.

03:55:21.273 --> 03:55:27.913

03:55:47.166 --> 03:55:50.903
NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN REAL

03:55:50.970 --> 03:55:53.539
MEANINGFUL WAYS BETWEEN THE

03:55:53.606 --> 03:55:55.774
LANDLORD OR THE OWNER OF THE

03:55:55.841 --> 03:55:58.210
PROPERTY AND THE CREDITOR THERE

03:55:58.277 --> 03:56:00.746
ARE PROVISIONS IN THERE THAT-

03:56:00.813 --> 03:56:03.015
ARE DESIGNED TO BE HELPFUL.

03:56:03.082 --> 03:56:06.719
TRYING TO ALLOW FOR THE 25% ON

03:56:06.785 --> 03:56:10.189
HUMANS BY THE RENTER- ALLOWING

03:56:10.256 --> 03:56:13.058
THE OTHER INJECTION BASIE'S TO

03:56:13.125 --> 03:56:16.362
EXIST LONG AS IT'S NOT BASED ON

03:56:16.428 --> 03:56:20.299
CODE. THAT INCOME. THAT WILL BE

03:56:20.366 --> 03:56:22.434
OF PERJURY AFTER DAVID NOW

03:56:22.501 --> 03:56:24.904
EXISTS WE'RE IN A RENTER HAS TO

03:56:24.970 --> 03:56:27.339
IDENTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF

03:56:27.406 --> 03:56:29.475
PERJURY THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO

03:56:29.542 --> 03:56:32.077
PAY AND PURSUITS PRESUMABLY THE

03:56:32.144 --> 03:56:34.813
GROUNDS UPON WHICH THAT

03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:37.550
DETERMINATION IS BASED. WHAT I

03:56:37.616 --> 03:56:42.187
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IS. WE

03:56:42.254 --> 03:56:44.490
NEED TO FIGURE OUT BETWEEN NOW.

03:56:44.557 --> 03:56:46.892
AND THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WHAT

03:56:46.959 --> 03:56:50.462
ARE WE GOING TO DO TO HELP.

03:56:50.529 --> 03:56:52.231
BIRDS THE ONES ARE CURING THE

03:56:52.298 --> 03:56:53.966
NOTE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THERE

03:56:54.033 --> 03:56:56.435
IS LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT IS

03:56:56.502 --> 03:57:00.306
HELPFUL AND INSTRUCTIVE THAT.

03:57:00.372 --> 03:57:04.176
WOULD ALLOW A BANK TO. ENGAGE

03:57:04.243 --> 03:57:08.247
WITH A BORROWER IN IN WAYS THAT

03:57:08.314 --> 03:57:09.515
WOULD BE HELPFUL THERE'S NO

03:57:09.582 --> 03:57:11.850
REAL LEGAL TEETH IN IT IN THE

03:57:11.917 --> 03:57:14.753
DINNER CAMPING ON WE KNOW THAT

03:57:14.820 --> 03:57:16.155
THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE.

03:57:16.221 --> 03:57:19.158
CONTRACT PRIVATE PROPERTY AND

03:57:19.224 --> 03:57:21.360
FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES SO

03:57:21.427 --> 03:57:23.095
THIS THING IS FRAUGHT WITH

03:57:23.162 --> 03:57:26.799
PROBLEMS. THE REASON WHY I

03:57:26.865 --> 03:57:30.235
SUPPORTED IT IN JUDICIARY IS

03:57:30.302 --> 03:57:33.672
BECAUSE IT BECAME BETTER IN THE

03:57:33.739 --> 03:57:36.041
PROCESS BUT I WANT TO MAKE

03:57:36.108 --> 03:57:37.176
CERTAIN THAT I BELIEVE THERE

03:57:37.242 --> 03:57:38.811
ARE TWO THINGS THAT NEED TO

03:57:38.877 --> 03:57:39.578
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

03:57:39.645 --> 03:57:43.148
MONTHS. ONE IS THAT WE-

03:57:43.215 --> 03:57:44.617
ENDEAVOR TO CREATE A TAX

03:57:44.683 --> 03:57:48.287
CREDITS. WHEREBY AID LANDLORD

03:57:48.354 --> 03:57:51.190
WHOSE ONLY BEEN BEING. WHICH

03:57:51.256 --> 03:57:54.426
ONLY COLLECTED. 25% OF THE RED

03:57:54.493 --> 03:57:56.295
BUT HE'S STILL ALL GET ON THE

03:57:56.362 --> 03:57:58.230
TERMS OF THE LOAN THAT THERE BE

03:57:58.297 --> 03:58:00.532
A TAX CREDIT SO THIS CAN BE

03:58:00.599 --> 03:58:02.301
WRITTEN OFF CALIFORNIA TAXES

03:58:02.368 --> 03:58:05.137
AND I THINK THAT IS. TERRIBLY

03:58:05.204 --> 03:58:08.307
IMPORTANT. THE SECOND THAT THIS

03:58:08.374 --> 03:58:11.143
ENDS IN JANUARY. IT CAN'T GO

03:58:11.210 --> 03:58:12.544
BEYOND THAT NINETY NINE I KNOW

03:58:12.611 --> 03:58:13.879
THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING

03:58:13.946 --> 03:58:17.016
TO WANT TO SEE THIS GO ON FOR.

03:58:17.082 --> 03:58:18.550
YOU KNOW THE DURATION OF THE

03:58:18.617 --> 03:58:21.754
PANDEMIC OR THE END OF THE

03:58:21.820 --> 03:58:23.722
DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR.

03:58:23.789 --> 03:58:26.058
REALISTICALLY UNTIL EVERYONE IS

03:58:26.125 --> 03:58:27.760
ECONOMICALLY BACK ON THEIR FEET

03:58:27.826 --> 03:58:29.495
BUT THAT IS. I DON'T BELIEVE

03:58:29.561 --> 03:58:34.199
SUSTAINABLE. I SUPPORTING THIS

03:58:34.266 --> 03:58:36.802
IS BECAUSE- ALL THE FOLKS CAME

03:58:36.869 --> 03:58:40.105
TOGETHER IN IN IN. IN GOOD

03:58:40.172 --> 03:58:42.608
FAITH TO MAKE MEANINGFUL

03:58:42.675 --> 03:58:44.643
PROPOSALS THAT WILL GET US

03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:47.112
THROUGH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

03:58:47.179 --> 03:58:49.214
BUT I WON'T SUPPORT THE

03:58:49.281 --> 03:58:51.316
CONTINUATION WHEN THIS IF THIS

03:58:51.383 --> 03:58:53.185
COMES BACK IN JANUARY FOR AN

03:58:53.252 --> 03:58:55.688
EXTENSION I WILL DEFINITELY NOT

03:58:55.754 --> 03:58:57.690
BE SUPPORTING IT DOWN BUT WE

03:58:57.756 --> 03:59:00.325
HAVE A PURITY TIME WITHIN WHICH

03:59:00.392 --> 03:59:02.928
WE HAVE TO MARSHAL THE ENERGIES

03:59:02.995 --> 03:59:05.497
AND THE RESOURCES. THAT ALLOW

03:59:05.564 --> 03:59:07.166
INDIVIDUALS TO GET BACK ON

03:59:07.232 --> 03:59:09.635
THEIR FEET AND FIND WAYS TO BE

03:59:09.702 --> 03:59:11.670
HELPFUL TO THE LANDLORDS AND

03:59:11.737 --> 03:59:13.972
THE BORROWERS BECAUSE IF WE

03:59:14.039 --> 03:59:17.109
CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH WE MAY

03:59:17.176 --> 03:59:18.644
HAVE SHORT TERM SURVIVAL BUT

03:59:18.711 --> 03:59:21.146
LIQUIDITY IS GOING TO DRY UP

03:59:21.213 --> 03:59:24.650
MEANING THAT CREDITORS KNOWING.

03:59:24.717 --> 03:59:26.552
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

03:59:26.618 --> 03:59:28.587
PROBLEMS WITH PROPERTIES NEW

03:59:28.654 --> 03:59:30.889
BORROWERS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO

03:59:30.956 --> 03:59:32.624
BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD

03:59:32.691 --> 03:59:36.462
MEETING MUCH MORE CASH DOWN. OR

03:59:36.528 --> 03:59:38.530
MORE UNFAVORABLE RATES SO THE

03:59:38.597 --> 03:59:40.566
HOUSING ELEMENT MEDIUM AND LONG

03:59:40.632 --> 03:59:42.634
TERM IS GOING TO HURT US AS

03:59:42.701 --> 03:59:45.104
CALIFORNIANS IF WE DON'T TAKE

03:59:45.170 --> 03:59:46.772
CORRECTIVE ACTION IMMEDIATELY.

03:59:46.839 --> 03:59:48.741
OVER THESE NEXT FEW MONTHS SO I

03:59:48.807 --> 03:59:49.975
KNOW THE YOU KNOW REASONABLE

03:59:50.042 --> 03:59:51.844
PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON THIS

03:59:51.910 --> 03:59:54.379
ISSUE AND I'M A PRIVATE

03:59:54.446 --> 03:59:56.081
PROPERTY RIGHTS KIND OF PERSON.

03:59:56.148 --> 04:00:00.252
AND I REPRESENT A LOT OF FOLKS

04:00:00.319 --> 04:00:01.687
THAT DO YOU HAVE. PROPERTIES

04:00:01.754 --> 04:00:04.256
ABOVE THE FOUR UNITS. AND ABOUT

04:00:04.323 --> 04:00:06.759

04:00:06.825 --> 04:00:08.127
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT

04:00:08.193 --> 04:00:10.329
EXEMPTION ONLY THE FOUR UNITS

04:00:10.395 --> 04:00:13.198

04:00:13.265 --> 04:00:14.833
AGGREGATE REACHED IT'S TO ME

04:00:14.900 --> 04:00:18.537
IT'S NOT BY EIGHT PM IT'S

04:00:18.604 --> 04:00:20.339
AGGREGATE SO IF YOU HAVE TO. IF

04:00:20.405 --> 04:00:22.341
YOU HAVE THREE DUPLEXES YOU'RE

04:00:22.407 --> 04:00:24.376
OUT IT'S AGGREGATE IN THAT

04:00:24.443 --> 04:00:28.647
SITUATION. SO I'LL LEAVE IT UP

04:00:28.714 --> 04:00:30.449
TO OTHER FOLKS TO CHIME IN IF

04:00:30.516 --> 04:00:31.683
THEY HAVE QUESTIONS OR

04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:33.051

TROLLING TO CRAFT TOGETHER

IN TENANTS WHO ARE DESPERATE-

04:01:22.801 --> 04:01:24.002

04:01:24.069 --> 04:01:25.637
ISSUES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:01:25.704 --> 04:01:27.306

THEY KNOW IT WILL BE OUT ON THE

04:01:29.441 --> 04:01:33.145
STREETS. WE ALSO HAVE SMALL

04:01:33.212 --> 04:01:33.745

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP.

04:01:55.901 --> 04:01:57.636
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T PRINT MONEY

04:01:57.703 --> 04:01:59.271
CAN'T PRINT MONEY WE HAVE TO

04:01:59.338 --> 04:02:00.606
BALANCE OUR BUDGET BUT THE

04:02:00.672 --> 04:02:03.175
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE

04:02:03.242 --> 04:02:03.775
THE ABILITY TO COME IN AND BE

04:02:03.842 --> 04:02:05.777
HELPFUL. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE

WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THAT

04:10:56.007 --> 04:10:57.375
TRYING TO JUST GET BY DURING

04:10:57.442 --> 04:10:58.376
THIS VERY VERY CHALLENGING

04:10:58.443 --> 04:11:01.045
TIME. I WILL BE A NO VOTE. AND

04:11:01.112 --> 04:11:02.547
IT WILL BE A STRONG NO VOTE

04:11:02.614 --> 04:11:04.149
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS

04:11:04.215 --> 04:11:06.017
REALLY CONSIDERS ONLY ONE SIDE

04:11:06.084 --> 04:11:07.552
OF THE EQUATION AGAIN. AND

04:11:07.619 --> 04:11:09.053
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S BEEN

04:11:09.120 --> 04:11:10.889
WRONG WITH A LOT OF LEGISLATION

04:11:10.955 --> 04:11:13.158
THAT SPONSORED HERE RECENTLY.

04:11:13.224 --> 04:11:14.225

THE SENATORS WHO SPOKE ON ON

04:11:37.949 --> 04:11:41.486

NOT NEW INFORMATION THESE HAVE

04:11:45.390 --> 04:11:46.491
BEEN EXACTLY THAT THE

04:11:46.558 --> 04:11:48.193
CONVERSATIONS THAT. THAT WE'VE

04:11:48.259 --> 04:11:53.097
BEEN HAVING OVER THE PAST.

04:11:53.164 --> 04:11:53.631
COUPLE OF MONTHS OVER THE

04:11:53.698 --> 04:11:54.265
POTENTIAL SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT

04:11:54.332 --> 04:11:56.034
THIS IS A- BE TWO. ONE THAT

04:11:56.100 --> 04:11:57.969
WAS- A SENATE BILL AND ONE THAT

04:11:58.036 --> 04:11:59.370
WAS IT AND ASSEMBLY BILL AND IT

04:11:59.437 --> 04:12:01.339
WAS WITH THE WITH THE-

04:12:01.406 --> 04:12:02.907
PARTICIPATION OF THE GOVERNOR

04:12:02.974 --> 04:12:04.809
SO THAT WE KNOW THAT WHATEVER

04:12:04.876 --> 04:12:06.811
IT IS WE PASS. HERE TODAY WILL

04:12:06.878 --> 04:12:08.413
BE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE

04:12:08.480 --> 04:12:10.148
GOVERNOR AS WELL. BUT BUT BUT

04:12:10.215 --> 04:12:11.916
LET ME LET ME GIVE YOU A GOOD

04:12:11.983 --> 04:12:14.619
NOTE. IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

04:12:14.686 --> 04:12:17.655
PANDEMIC. WITH BAD NEWS IS THAT

04:12:17.722 --> 04:12:19.190
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

04:12:19.257 --> 04:12:20.625
HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING OR WE

04:12:20.692 --> 04:12:21.626
HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY

04:12:21.693 --> 04:12:23.361
LITTLE. THE INFORMATION WE'VE

04:12:23.428 --> 04:12:25.897
RECEIVED FROM- THE DATA

04:12:25.964 --> 04:12:27.699
COLLECTORS IS IT PEOPLE HAVE

04:12:27.765 --> 04:12:29.300
CONTINUED TO PAY THE RENT.

04:12:29.367 --> 04:12:30.401
THEY'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH

04:12:30.468 --> 04:12:31.269
THEIR LANDLORDS AND THEY'VE

04:12:31.336 --> 04:12:32.871
BEEN TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT.

04:12:32.937 --> 04:12:34.706
AND SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO

04:12:34.772 --> 04:12:36.474
HERE IS TO SET UP A FRAMEWORK

04:12:36.541 --> 04:12:38.209
GOING FORWARD THAT WILL ALLOW

04:12:38.276 --> 04:12:41.112
LANDLORDS. TO BE ABLE TO- TO

04:12:41.179 --> 04:12:44.148
CONTINUE TO TAKE RENT. ON THE

04:12:44.215 --> 04:12:44.782
MINIMUM THAT HAS TO BE PAID IS

04:12:44.849 --> 04:12:47.151
AT LEAST 25% WITH THE UP A NOTE

04:12:47.218 --> 04:12:48.987
AND UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY

04:12:49.053 --> 04:12:50.188
AND THE MEANS TEST IS THOSE

04:12:50.255 --> 04:12:51.956
OVER. EARNING OVER A HUNDRED

04:12:52.023 --> 04:12:53.191
THOUSAND HAVE TO SHOW. SOME

04:12:53.258 --> 04:12:55.460
KIND OF. LETTER FROM THEIR

04:12:55.527 --> 04:12:56.728
EMPLOYER OR SOME KIND OF PROOF

04:12:56.794 --> 04:12:57.996
THAT THEY BEEN NEGATIVELY

04:12:58.062 --> 04:12:59.964
IMPACTED. AND THE WHOLE. THE

04:13:00.031 --> 04:13:01.533
WHOLE POINT OF DOING THIS THIS

04:13:01.599 --> 04:13:03.334
WAY. IS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE

04:13:03.401 --> 04:13:05.069
MORE WORK TO DO WE KNOW THAT

04:13:05.136 --> 04:13:06.738
THERE'S A WE NEED TO SET UP.

04:13:06.804 --> 04:13:08.740
THEIR CONTINUING WORK AND THE

04:13:08.806 --> 04:13:10.208
KINDS OF THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

04:13:10.275 --> 04:13:12.110
TALKING ABOUT IS HOW- WHETHER

04:13:12.176 --> 04:13:13.711
WE DO A TAX CREDIT WHETHER THE

04:13:13.778 --> 04:13:15.647
STATE BUDGET HAS MONEY TO BE

04:13:15.713 --> 04:13:16.781
ABLE TO USE AS COLLATERAL TO BE

04:13:16.848 --> 04:13:18.883
ABLE TO- ENCOURAGED THE BANKS

04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:20.051
TO DO SOMETHING WHETHER WE GET

04:13:20.118 --> 04:13:22.954
FEDERAL FUNDS INTEREST MLS-

04:13:23.021 --> 04:13:26.991
ACT. AND THEN ALL SO THAT THERE

04:13:27.058 --> 04:13:27.625
ISN'T AS NEVER BEEN A BETTER.

04:13:27.692 --> 04:13:30.161
TO REACH FIND. MORTGAGES AND

04:13:30.228 --> 04:13:31.563
THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THE

04:13:31.629 --> 04:13:32.864
FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO

04:13:32.931 --> 04:13:34.599
GO AND TALK TO THEIR BANKS. AND

04:13:34.666 --> 04:13:35.567
TO BE ABLE TO WORK OUT

04:13:35.633 --> 04:13:37.168
SOMETHING WHICH IS PART OF A

04:13:37.235 --> 04:13:38.803
FOR A PHOTO OF A FORBEARANCE

04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:41.372
FRAMEWORK SO- THAT'S MY

04:13:41.439 --> 04:13:43.841
ELEVATOR SPEECH IS IT. WHAT WE

04:13:43.908 --> 04:13:45.777
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE ACTION

04:13:45.843 --> 04:13:47.345
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE FAILURE TO DO

04:13:47.412 --> 04:13:49.347
SO COULD RESULT IN THOUSANDS OF

04:13:49.414 --> 04:13:51.082
CALIFORNIANS. ENDING UP ON THE

04:13:51.149 --> 04:13:52.717
STREET AT A TIME WHEN OUR

04:13:52.784 --> 04:13:54.218

04:13:54.285 --> 04:13:56.854
HIGHEST AND- AND IN THE MIDDLE

04:13:56.921 --> 04:13:58.256

04:14:01.559 --> 04:14:03.795
UNTENABLE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO

MIGHT GET A LITTLE TIRING. BUT

04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:08.685
I THINK YOU CAN TELL HOW

04:41:08.751 --> 04:41:12.055
STRONGLY WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY

04:41:12.121 --> 04:41:16.693
FIVE. ESPECIALLY IN THE KOBE

04:41:16.759 --> 04:41:17.126
EXPERIENCE WHICH IS

04:41:17.193 --> 04:41:20.930
HIGHLIGHTING OUR STRUCTURAL.

04:41:20.997 --> 04:41:23.800
CHALLENGES FOR STATE HOW

04:41:23.866 --> 04:41:27.570
IMPORTANT IT IS FOR SOMEONE.

04:41:27.637 --> 04:41:30.940
LIVELIHOOD TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY

FRANCHISEE IN THE FRANCHISE OR

04:41:43.019 --> 04:41:44.687
SO THIS LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

04:41:44.754 --> 04:41:46.155
THERE'S STRONG REASON TO

04:41:46.222 --> 04:41:48.658
BELIEVE THAT. THE CURRENT AB

04:41:48.725 --> 04:41:51.394
FIVE RULES. AND ALSO THE

04:41:51.461 --> 04:41:54.330

04:41:54.397 --> 04:41:56.799
CREATE SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS

04:41:56.866 --> 04:41:58.868
WITH WHAT EXACTLY A FRANCHISE

04:41:58.935 --> 04:42:01.938

FOR A FRANCHISE. THAT BB FIVE

04:42:15.518 --> 04:42:18.254
WOULD BE USED EFFECTIVELY USED

04:42:18.321 --> 04:42:19.355
TO FORCIBLY CREATE A

04:42:19.422 --> 04:42:21.124
RELATIONSHIP WHEREBY IT THE

04:42:21.190 --> 04:42:25.061
FRANCHISE OWNER IN CALIFORNIA.

04:42:25.128 --> 04:42:27.297
IN THE END THE EMPLOYEES WITHIN

04:42:27.363 --> 04:42:28.831
THE FRANCHISE ITSELF

04:42:28.898 --> 04:42:31.934
COLLECTIVELY BE CLASSIFIED AS

04:42:32.001 --> 04:42:33.236

REALLY THE THREE REASONS I DID

PERHAPS WE COULD LOSE A MILLION

04:47:52.088 --> 04:47:54.357
JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T

04:47:54.423 --> 04:47:55.024
THINK ANY OF US WANT TO SEE

04:47:55.091 --> 04:47:57.526
THIS- AND THAT THAT WAS BY THE-

04:47:57.593 --> 04:47:59.028
ELLIE ALL BY THE WAY WHO

04:47:59.095 --> 04:48:00.529
BELIEVE THAT THAT THREATENS-

04:48:00.596 --> 04:48:03.633
OVER MILLIONS. OF FREELANCERS-

04:48:03.699 --> 04:48:05.801

A TIME IN A PANDEMIC THAT WE

NOT TAKE THE AMENDMENTS BUT-

05:14:26.047 --> 05:14:27.582
THIS BILLDOES MOVE THE NEEDLE

05:14:27.648 --> 05:14:30.484
A LITTLE BIT. AND I GUESS- A

05:14:30.551 --> 05:14:31.319

05:14:51.339 --> 05:14:54.709
INTRODUCED TO AMEND. THE

05:14:54.775 --> 05:14:55.543
ORIGINAL BELT SHOULD TELL

EVERYONE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING

05:14:56.844 --> 05:14:58.946
TERRIBLY WRONG. WITH THIS BILL

JOB AND THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE

05:15:06.954 --> 05:15:08.256
THIS WAY AND- YOU KNOW THERE

05:15:08.322 --> 05:15:11.392
WAS A COMMENT MADE. ORIGINALLY

05:15:11.459 --> 05:15:12.960
WHERE THE DOCTOR SAID THAT

05:15:13.027 --> 05:15:14.829
THOSE WEREN'T REAL JOBS ANYWAY.

05:15:14.895 --> 05:15:15.997
WELL I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY

05:15:16.063 --> 05:15:17.465
WERE REAL JOBS AND THEY WERE

05:15:17.531 --> 05:15:19.433
REAL PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN

05:15:19.500 --> 05:15:21.969
AFFECTED. BY THIS LEGISLATION

05:15:22.036 --> 05:15:25.306
AND NOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

05:15:25.373 --> 05:15:27.642
DO IT. AT A TIME. I MEAN IT

05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:28.709

PEOPLE ARE LUCKY. TO EVEN STILL

05:15:31.846 --> 05:15:33.514
HAVE A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT TO

05:15:33.581 --> 05:15:35.716
GO THIS IS HAVING A TERRIBLE

05:15:35.783 --> 05:15:37.251
EFFECT ON PEOPLE MEAN JUST.

05:15:37.318 --> 05:15:38.753
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN

05:15:38.819 --> 05:15:39.920
SAID YOU KNOW THEY THEY

05:15:39.987 --> 05:15:42.456
ABSOLUTELY MUST WORK IN THIS

05:15:42.523 --> 05:15:43.291
FASHION BECAUSE THEY HAVE

05:15:43.357 --> 05:15:45.726
SOMEONE AT HOME. WHO IS WHO IS

05:15:45.793 --> 05:15:46.994

05:15:47.061 --> 05:15:48.429
CARE WHERE THEY HAVE A SPECIAL

05:15:48.496 --> 05:15:49.597

THAT. THEY WERE NOT HIRED

05:15:57.772 --> 05:15:58.139
BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN

05:15:58.205 --> 05:15:59.974
CALIFORNIA. AND SO THEY WILL

05:16:00.041 --> 05:16:02.043
TAKE SOMEONE FROM OUT OF STATE

05:16:02.109 --> 05:16:02.643
RATHER THAN TAKE SOMEONE FROM

05:16:02.710 --> 05:16:04.945
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE FEAR

05:16:05.012 --> 05:16:06.047
THAT THEY MIGHT RUN AFOUL OF

05:16:06.113 --> 05:16:08.215
THE LAW. THIS IS. ONE OF THE

05:16:08.282 --> 05:16:10.418
MOST DISASTROUS PIECES OF

05:16:10.484 --> 05:16:12.219
LEGISLATION WE COULD HAVE EVER

05:16:12.286 --> 05:16:13.821

THEIR WAY OF LIFE FOR THEM AND

05:16:32.940 --> 05:16:34.208

ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO TO

05:29:43.830 --> 05:29:46.233
REALIZE HERE IS THAT THIS IS AN

05:29:46.299 --> 05:29:49.202
ISSUE BUT THIRTY SEVENTY IS NOT

05:29:49.269 --> 05:29:51.271
THE RESOLUTION OF THAT ISSUE

05:29:51.338 --> 05:29:53.039
THERE ARE OTHER METHODS AGAIN

ELIMINATE PRINT TREES WHAT

05:29:56.443 --> 05:29:58.178
THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL

05:29:58.245 --> 05:30:01.114
BASICALLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE

05:30:01.181 --> 05:30:03.950
DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY WHEN RACE

05:30:04.017 --> 05:30:05.318
IS AN ISSUE AND I'M NOT TALKING

05:30:05.385 --> 05:30:06.720
ABOUT RACE WITH RESPECT TO THE

05:30:06.786 --> 05:30:08.321

WITH RESPECT TO THE VICTIM

05:30:10.090 --> 05:30:12.159
WHAT THIS DOES IS ESSENTIALLY

05:30:12.225 --> 05:30:14.227
WHERE THE DEFENSE COUNSEL HAS

05:30:14.294 --> 05:30:16.062
TEN PRINTER JONES ON A FAMILY

05:30:16.129 --> 05:30:18.398

THERE'S LIFE IMPRISONMENT

05:30:20.100 --> 05:30:21.568
AND THE PROSECUTORS BASICALLY

05:30:21.635 --> 05:30:23.737
ELIMINATED FROM THE EQUATION

05:30:23.803 --> 05:30:24.905
WHAT THAT WILL DO IS WILL

05:30:24.971 --> 05:30:27.507
SKEW THE JURY AND YOU MARK MY

05:30:27.574 --> 05:30:29.242
WORDS THAT THIS IS GOING TO

CREATE NOT JUST AN IMPEDIMENT

05:30:32.145 --> 05:30:33.380
BUT IT'S GOING TO CREATE A

05:30:33.446 --> 05:30:36.816
MAJOR PROBLEM I URGE A NO VOTE

05:30:36.883 --> 05:30:39.452
AND I URGE THAT WE ACTUALLY

05:30:39.519 --> 05:30:40.687
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS

05:30:40.754 --> 05:30:42.556

INSTANCES GOING I HAD A GOOD

05:30:43.924 --> 05:30:45.659
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPACT

05:30:45.725 --> 05:30:46.927
OF THIS BILL AND AND WHAT WE

05:30:46.993 --> 05:30:49.296
MIGHT DO TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE

05:30:49.362 --> 05:30:51.531
I URGE THAT WE DO RESOLVE

05:30:51.598 --> 05:30:53.833

LENGTHY DISCUSSION ON EIGHTY

05:31:12.485 --> 05:31:15.322
FIVE AND THE REASON WHY I

05:31:15.388 --> 05:31:17.691
BRING THAT UP IS I'VE HAD THE

05:31:17.757 --> 05:31:19.092
OPPORTUNITY HAVE CONVERSATIONS

05:31:19.159 --> 05:31:20.560

LEGISLATURE IN BOTH HOUSES

05:31:22.996 --> 05:31:24.331
FOLKS THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORTED

05:31:24.397 --> 05:31:28.835
AB FIVE BUT PRIVATELY HAD HAVE

05:31:28.902 --> 05:31:31.438
SPOKEN -- WHETHER OR NOT THE

05:31:31.504 --> 05:31:32.505
ISSUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VETTED

05:31:32.572 --> 05:31:34.841
MORE PRIOR TO A DECISION BEING

05:31:34.908 --> 05:31:37.544
MADE I USE THIS BY ANALOGY

05:31:37.611 --> 05:31:40.647
HERE THAT YESTERDAY'S ROBUST

05:31:40.714 --> 05:31:42.082
DISCUSSION UPON PEREMPTORY

05:31:42.148 --> 05:31:44.384
CHALLENGES YOU'RE HEARING FROM

05:31:44.451 --> 05:31:47.487
SO MANY FOLKS IN YOU WILL EVEN

05:31:47.554 --> 05:31:51.258
MORE DOWN THE ROAD THAT IF

05:31:51.324 --> 05:31:52.859
WE'RE LEARNING A LESSON ON HOW

05:31:52.926 --> 05:31:54.828
THIS IMPACTS PEOPLE WHETHER IT

05:31:54.894 --> 05:31:56.763
BE DEFENDANTS WHETHER BE PUBLIC

05:31:56.830 --> 05:31:58.398
DEFENDERS WHETHER BE PROSECUTED

05:31:58.465 --> 05:32:01.768
BE JUDGES THIS CLEARLY DID

05:32:01.835 --> 05:32:02.769
NOT GO THROUGH A VETTING

05:32:02.836 --> 05:32:04.371
PROCESS AND I WOULD IMPLORE

05:32:04.437 --> 05:32:06.906
MY COLLEAGUES LET THIS GO

05:32:06.973 --> 05:32:08.942
THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS BE

05:32:09.009 --> 05:32:12.679
BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY BECAUSE

05:32:12.746 --> 05:32:13.913
IF WE'RE TO LEARN A LESSON

05:32:13.980 --> 05:32:15.548
FROM HOW WE BE FIVE PLAYED

05:32:15.615 --> 05:32:18.218
ITSELF OUT IT WILL AFFECT YOUR

05:32:18.285 --> 05:32:21.054
COMMUNITIES AND IN WAYS WITH A

05:32:21.121 --> 05:32:23.223
LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

05:32:23.290 --> 05:32:24.958
SO EVEN THOUGH I THINK THIS

05:32:25.025 --> 05:32:26.893
THING HAS A LOT OF MERIT

05:32:26.960 --> 05:32:29.362
IN A FEW DIFFERENT AREAS HE

05:32:29.429 --> 05:32:31.464
DESERVES TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE

05:32:31.531 --> 05:32:33.033
SCREENINGS ARE COMMITTEES

05:32:33.099 --> 05:32:35.969
WITH EXPERTS AT HAND AND --

05:32:36.036 --> 05:32:37.737
THE NORMAL VETTING PROCESS

05:32:37.804 --> 05:32:40.774
THAT ALLOWS FOR GOOD POLICY

05:32:40.840 --> 05:32:43.610
THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR BORDER

TERM COLLEAGUES AS YOU KNOW

05:32:49.282 --> 05:32:50.216
I'VE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF

05:32:50.283 --> 05:32:53.253
TIME IN MY VARIOUS CAREERS IN

05:32:53.320 --> 05:32:55.889
OUT OF COURT ROOMS AND I HAVE

05:32:55.955 --> 05:32:59.859
TO CONFESS THAT MINE -- BIASES

05:32:59.926 --> 05:33:01.594
AGAINST THE USE OF PEREMPTORY

05:33:01.661 --> 05:33:04.931
CHALLENGES IN FACT I ACTUALLY

05:33:04.998 --> 05:33:07.667
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD -- THE

05:33:07.734 --> 05:33:09.369
DOCTOR MEASURE THAT ELIMINATES

05:33:09.436 --> 05:33:10.637
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IN THE

05:33:10.704 --> 05:33:11.671
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE

05:33:11.738 --> 05:33:13.006
NOT REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA

05:33:13.073 --> 05:33:17.110
CONSTITUTION AND -- THE PROCESS

05:33:17.177 --> 05:33:18.278
FOR THE USE OF PEREMPTORY

05:33:18.345 --> 05:33:19.612
CHALLENGES IS RIFE WITH

05:33:19.679 --> 05:33:21.915
PROBLEMS INCLUDING PROBLEMS

05:33:21.981 --> 05:33:24.084
OF DISCRIMINATION AND THE

05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:27.153
LIKE SO WHEN I REVIEWED THIS

05:33:27.220 --> 05:33:32.092
MEASURE I WAS PREDISPOSED TO

05:33:32.158 --> 05:33:36.963
VOTE TO A ADOPTED MMHM BUT I

05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:39.499
WAS APPROACHED BY FOLKS FROM

05:33:39.566 --> 05:33:41.801
ALL SIDES AS PART OF THIS

05:33:41.868 --> 05:33:43.870
PROCESS AND AFTER BEING POUNDED

05:33:43.937 --> 05:33:45.472
FOR A FEW DAYS I DECIDED I

05:33:45.538 --> 05:33:46.706
REALLY NEEDED TO DIG INTO

05:33:46.773 --> 05:33:49.275
THIS MEASURE AND SEE WHAT THE

05:33:49.342 --> 05:33:51.277
BILL ACTUALLY SAID BEYOND JUST

05:33:51.344 --> 05:33:52.445
READING IT AND HOW IT WOULD

05:33:52.512 --> 05:33:55.148
APPLY TO THE PRACTICE OF TRYING

05:33:55.215 --> 05:33:56.716
TO WORK IN A CALIFORNIA COURT

05:33:56.783 --> 05:33:59.152
SYSTEM AND SO I'M SPEAKING

05:33:59.219 --> 05:34:01.921
BY WAY OF EXPLANATION OF MY

05:34:01.988 --> 05:34:04.758
NO VOTE BEFORE AND MY NO VOTE

05:34:04.824 --> 05:34:06.426
AS THIS ROLE IS CALLED ONCE

05:34:06.493 --> 05:34:08.862
AGAIN AND WHAT I FOUND WHEN

05:34:08.928 --> 05:34:10.330
I LEARNT LOOKED INTO THE BILL

05:34:10.397 --> 05:34:11.731
IN THE PROCESS THAT IT WAS

05:34:11.798 --> 05:34:13.800
IT WAS COMPELLING FOR USE IN

05:34:13.867 --> 05:34:15.101
OUR TRIAL COURTS IN THE STATE

05:34:15.168 --> 05:34:17.737
OF CALIFORNIA I FOUND FROM MY

05:34:17.804 --> 05:34:19.139
PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS GOING TO

05:34:19.205 --> 05:34:21.441
LENGTHEN THE PROCESS BY WHICH

05:34:21.508 --> 05:34:22.842
ARE CRIMINAL COURT TRIALS

05:34:22.909 --> 05:34:24.944
ARE BROUGHT TO CONCLUSION AND

05:34:25.011 --> 05:34:26.646
WHEN IT APPLIES TO THE CIVIL

05:34:26.713 --> 05:34:28.581
TRIALS IN OUR STATE IT WOULD

05:34:28.648 --> 05:34:30.717
LENGTHEN THOSE AS WELL AND

05:34:30.784 --> 05:34:32.118
COMING FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY

05:34:32.185 --> 05:34:35.822
WERE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO

05:34:35.889 --> 05:34:37.624
IT WAS TAKING MORE THAN FIVE

05:34:37.690 --> 05:34:39.893
YEARS TO GET A CIVIL CASE TO

05:34:39.959 --> 05:34:42.462
TRIAL SUCH THAT THEY HAD TO

05:34:42.529 --> 05:34:44.731
CALL THE CASES CALL THEM AND

05:34:44.798 --> 05:34:47.367
THEN A JOURNALISM TO AVOID

05:34:47.434 --> 05:34:48.902
HAVING THE CASES DISMISSED

05:34:48.968 --> 05:34:49.936
BECAUSE WE HAVE A RULE IN THE

05:34:50.003 --> 05:34:51.871
STATE BUT IF THE CASE IS NOT

05:34:51.938 --> 05:34:53.072
BROUGHT TO TRIAL WITHIN FIVE

05:34:53.139 --> 05:34:54.941
YEARS IF IT'S A CIVIL CASE

05:34:55.008 --> 05:34:57.043
IT WILL BE DISMISSED AND THAT

05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:59.045
WAS BECAUSE OUR CRIMINAL CASES

05:34:59.112 --> 05:35:00.447
WERE TAKING UP ALL OF THE

05:35:00.513 --> 05:35:03.383
AVAILABLE COURT ROOMS ALMOST

05:35:03.450 --> 05:35:06.119
IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SO I LOOKED

05:35:06.186 --> 05:35:08.188
AT THIS PROCESS AND I NOTICED

05:35:08.254 --> 05:35:09.722
THAT ARE CALIFORNIA JUDGES

05:35:09.789 --> 05:35:11.991
ASSOCIATION A GROUP OF TRIAL

05:35:12.058 --> 05:35:13.660
JUDGES THAT HAVE TO MANAGE THE

05:35:13.726 --> 05:35:16.296
PROCESS IN OUR COURT SYSTEM

05:35:16.362 --> 05:35:18.164
HAD A SERIES OF CONCERNS ABOUT

05:35:18.231 --> 05:35:20.733
THE WAY THE BILL WAS DRAFTED

05:35:20.800 --> 05:35:22.168
END OF THE CALIFORNIA TRIAL

05:35:22.235 --> 05:35:24.270
JUDGES ASSOCIATION LISTED

05:35:24.337 --> 05:35:25.839
THESE CONCERNS IN ONE OR MORE

05:35:25.905 --> 05:35:28.208
DOCUMENTS AND TOOK A LOOK AT

05:35:28.274 --> 05:35:30.343
THEM AND I REJECTED THOSE THAT

05:35:30.410 --> 05:35:31.711
I THOUGHT HAD LESS MIRRORED AND

05:35:31.778 --> 05:35:34.180
I CAME UP WITH A LIST OF ABOUT

05:35:34.247 --> 05:35:35.748
TEN CONCERNS THAT I THOUGHT

05:35:35.815 --> 05:35:38.218
WERE SUBSTANTIAL AND FRANKLY

05:35:38.284 --> 05:35:40.053
I REDUCE START SPENT THE NIGHT

05:35:40.119 --> 05:35:41.654
DOING THIS ON A REDUCED THESE

05:35:41.721 --> 05:35:44.190
CONCERNS TO A TWO PAGE DOCUMENT

05:35:44.257 --> 05:35:46.192
AND I SENT THE DOCUMENT AROUND

05:35:46.259 --> 05:35:48.695
AND I ASKED THE AUTHORS STAFF

05:35:48.761 --> 05:35:50.763
THROUGH MY STAFF WHAT WERE

05:35:50.830 --> 05:35:52.298
THE WHAT WERE THE REASONS WHAT

05:35:52.365 --> 05:35:53.666
WAS THE RATIONALE THAT THESE

05:35:53.733 --> 05:35:56.836
CONCERNS WERE NOT ADDRESSED

05:35:56.903 --> 05:35:59.172
WHY DID YOU NOT TAKE A LOOK

05:35:59.239 --> 05:36:00.373
AT THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING

05:36:00.440 --> 05:36:01.741
TEST THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE

NONE OF US WOULD ARE HAPPY

06:00:50.929 --> 06:00:53.565
ABOUT. OUR WILDLIFE SIDE.

06:00:53.631 --> 06:00:56.434
EATING SOME ANIMAL THAT HAS-

06:00:56.501 --> 06:00:59.204
POISON IN THEIR BODY THAT

06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.804
AFFECTS THEM I MEAN WHO WANTS

06:00:59.871 --> 06:01:01.740
THAT RIGHT. BUT WE HAVE A

06:01:01.806 --> 06:01:03.541
PROCESS IN THE STATE THAT DEALS

06:01:03.608 --> 06:01:04.476
WITH PESTICIDES AND OTHER

06:01:04.542 --> 06:01:05.810
CHEMICALS IN TERMS OF MAKING

06:01:05.877 --> 06:01:07.512
SURE THAT THE CHOICES WE MAKE.

06:01:07.579 --> 06:01:09.647
ARE NOT POLITICAL CHOICES THERE

06:01:09.714 --> 06:01:11.383
BASED ON SCIENCE. HOW OFTEN

06:01:11.449 --> 06:01:15.653
HAVE YOU. HURT OR YOU YOURSELF

06:01:15.720 --> 06:01:16.187
HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THE

06:01:16.254 --> 06:01:18.623
NATIONAL DEBATE THAT SCIENCE

06:01:18.690 --> 06:01:22.660
MATTERS. SCIENCE MATTERS AND SO

06:01:22.727 --> 06:01:24.829
HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION WE GET

06:01:24.896 --> 06:01:26.698
THESE ONCE EVERY YEAR TO COME

06:01:26.765 --> 06:01:29.768
BEFORE THE SENATE. WHERE

06:01:29.834 --> 06:01:32.037
SOMEONE SAYS THIS IS BAD AND WE

06:01:32.103 --> 06:01:33.638
NEED TO CIRCUMVENT THE PROCESS

06:01:33.705 --> 06:01:35.206
THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED IN LAW

06:01:35.273 --> 06:01:37.342
FOR HAVING A THOROUGH REVIEW

06:01:37.409 --> 06:01:40.145
BASED ON SCIENCE. AND SO MY

06:01:40.211 --> 06:01:41.212
OBJECTION TO THE BILL TODAY IS

06:01:41.279 --> 06:01:42.414
NOT BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

06:01:42.480 --> 06:01:45.917
THAT. RAT POISON BECAUSE I

06:01:45.984 --> 06:01:48.686
CERTAINLY AM. BUT IT'S ABOUT

06:01:48.753 --> 06:01:50.121
HONORING A PROCESS THAT WE'VE

06:01:50.188 --> 06:01:52.123
ESTABLISHED A LAW SO THAT THE

06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:54.726
JUDGMENT WE MAKE IS BASED ON

06:01:54.793 --> 06:01:56.594
SCIENCE NOT BASED ON POLITICS

06:01:56.661 --> 06:01:57.462
AND THAT'S THE SHORTCOMING OF

06:01:57.529 --> 06:01:59.197
THE BILL BEFORE YOU. AND WHILE

06:01:59.264 --> 06:02:06.071

OBVIOUSLY AS SOMEBODY WHO IS

06:02:11.309 --> 06:02:13.411
AGRICULTURAL HAZARD PESTICIDE

06:02:13.478 --> 06:02:15.346
OUTTURN APPLICATORS PERMIT HERE

CARES ABOUT WILDLIFE DEARLY AND

06:02:20.318 --> 06:02:22.120
I WANTED TO SHARE THAT FIRST OF

06:02:22.187 --> 06:02:23.588
ALL I WANT TO COMMEND THE

06:02:23.655 --> 06:02:25.223

TO EYE ON A LOT OF. ISSUES WHEN

06:02:27.292 --> 06:02:30.895
IT COMES TO WILDLIFE AND BUT IF

06:02:30.962 --> 06:02:32.397
YOU CAN GET THE FARM BUREAU AND

06:02:32.464 --> 06:02:33.832
THOSE FOLKS TO GO NEUTRAL I

06:02:33.898 --> 06:02:35.066
GOTTA GIVE IT TO ME MOST OF

06:02:35.133 --> 06:02:36.334
TOOK A HECK OF A LOT OF

06:02:36.401 --> 06:02:38.570
MINUTES. BUT THE POINT IS MORE

06:02:38.636 --> 06:02:40.538
SO IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

06:02:40.605 --> 06:02:42.774
PEOPLE WHO USE THESE ANTI

06:02:42.841 --> 06:02:45.543
COAGULANTS IN THERE THE REASON

06:02:45.610 --> 06:02:46.845
I'M IN THE WRONG WAY. AND SO I

06:02:46.911 --> 06:02:48.246
FEEL I AGREE WITH MY FRIEND

06:02:48.313 --> 06:02:49.514
FROM THE BAY AREA THAT. YOU CAN

06:02:49.581 --> 06:02:51.182
HAVE YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE LAWS

06:02:51.249 --> 06:02:52.217
YOU WANT BUT IF PEOPLE ARE

06:02:52.283 --> 06:02:54.719
USING- PRESCRIBING THEM IN THE

06:02:54.786 --> 06:02:57.455
RIGHT WAY. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE

06:02:57.522 --> 06:02:58.957
ALL KINDS THROUGHOUT

06:02:59.023 --> 06:03:02.961
CALIFORNIA. ILLEGAL POT GROWS

06:03:03.027 --> 06:03:04.329
USING ROW DIDN'T RODENTICIDES.

06:03:04.395 --> 06:03:05.730
TO KILL PREDATORS THAT ARE

06:03:05.797 --> 06:03:06.931
EATING THEIR PLANTS IT'S

06:03:06.998 --> 06:03:08.433
GETTING A WATER STREET JUST

06:03:08.500 --> 06:03:09.834
GETTING OUR FISH. IS KILLING

06:03:09.901 --> 06:03:12.237
THE MOUNTAIN LION THAT WE'RE

06:03:12.303 --> 06:03:13.138
TRYING TO PROTECT. AT THE SAME

06:03:13.204 --> 06:03:15.507
TIME WE'RE LOSING. THE MILLIONS

OF ACRES OF HABITAT FOR THESE

06:03:17.842 --> 06:03:20.612
ANIMALS AS WELL SO I THINK THAT

06:03:20.678 --> 06:03:21.980
WE NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING

06:03:22.046 --> 06:03:23.114
WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD SIZE WE NEED

06:03:23.181 --> 06:03:24.482
TO GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

06:03:24.549 --> 06:03:26.784
BREAKING THE LAW AND WHO ARE

06:03:26.851 --> 06:03:28.486
BUYING THESE THINGS ILLEGAL.

06:03:28.553 --> 06:03:30.221
AND USING THEM IN THE WRONG

06:03:30.288 --> 06:03:32.790
FASHION I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY

06:03:32.857 --> 06:03:35.860
THAT 99% OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

06:03:35.927 --> 06:03:38.062
REGULATED IN THIS BUSINESS ARE

06:03:38.129 --> 06:03:39.731
DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY I

06:03:39.797 --> 06:03:40.732
INCLUDING MYSELF I'M ONE OF

06:03:40.798 --> 06:03:42.967

ON THE RIGHT WAY WE WANTED TO

06:03:55.013 --> 06:03:57.382
NOT BE OVERPRESCRIBED. SO I

06:03:57.448 --> 06:03:58.416
WOULD JUST SHARE THAT I THINK

06:03:58.483 --> 06:04:00.718
THAT WE TAKE LEGISLATION WE

06:04:00.785 --> 06:04:02.887
MAKE LAWS BASED OFF OF THE

06:04:02.954 --> 06:04:04.622
MOTIONS THAT NOBODY WANTS

06:04:04.689 --> 06:04:07.292
AMOUNT LINE TO DIE BECAUSE OF

06:04:07.358 --> 06:04:09.327

FROM SOMEBODY WHO POISONED

06:04:11.196 --> 06:04:14.098
SOMETHING. SO MY GOAL HERE IS

06:04:14.165 --> 06:04:15.733
TO DO GOOD SCIENCE BUT ALSO GO

06:04:15.800 --> 06:04:17.569

IT WHY BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP AND

06:05:06.484 --> 06:05:07.785
IT'S EASY AND IT'S EASIER IN

06:05:07.852 --> 06:05:09.187

EFORE THE NURSE PRACTITIONER

06:13:21.879 --> 06:13:23.514
CAN PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY.

06:13:23.581 --> 06:13:24.648
ANOTHER AMENDMENT REQUIRES

THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. WHICH

06:13:53.511 --> 06:13:55.279
CORRESPONDS DIRECTLY TO THAT

06:13:55.346 --> 06:13:57.148
EDUCATION TRAINING. AND FINALLY

06:13:57.214 --> 06:13:58.949
THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO ENSURE

06:13:59.016 --> 06:14:00.818
THAT ANY DISCIPLINARY ISSUES.

06:14:00.885 --> 06:14:01.986

HAVE A TESTIFIED NUMBER OF

06:14:04.989 --> 06:14:07.091
POSITIONS ON IT. MEMBERS THIS

06:14:07.158 --> 06:14:09.193
BILL IS A GOOD BILL AND IT'S

06:14:09.260 --> 06:14:11.095
DESERVING OF YOUR SUPPORT TODAY

06:14:11.162 --> 06:14:11.929
I RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE THANK

06:14:11.996 --> 06:14:14.832
YOU VERY MUCH WITH DEBATE OR

06:14:14.899 --> 06:14:18.335
DISCUSSION SENATOR PAM. THANK

06:14:18.402 --> 06:14:22.339
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS. I

06:14:22.406 --> 06:14:25.910
APPRECIATE THE WORK OF OUR- MY

06:14:25.976 --> 06:14:27.311
GOOD FRIEND FROM AROUND- BUT

06:14:27.378 --> 06:14:28.813
UNFORTUNATELY I STILL HAVE TO

06:14:28.879 --> 06:14:31.549
STAND IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS

06:14:31.615 --> 06:14:34.084
BILL- I GUESS OUT FIRST JUST

06:14:34.151 --> 06:14:36.453
SAY IS THAT- WELL HE DIDN'T

06:14:36.520 --> 06:14:38.422
REFERENCE IT IN HIS REMARKS-

06:14:38.489 --> 06:14:40.291
SENSIBLY THE REASON FOR DOING

06:14:40.357 --> 06:14:43.928
THIS BILL WAS SUPPOSED TO- THIS

06:14:43.994 --> 06:14:47.164
ACTUALLY. ADDRESS ACCESS ISSUES

06:14:47.231 --> 06:14:49.400
IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES BUT I

06:14:49.466 --> 06:14:51.302
WOULD POINT OUT THAT- NURSE

06:14:51.368 --> 06:14:52.636
PRACTITIONERS ARE QUITE BUSY

06:14:52.703 --> 06:14:54.038
RIGHT NOW AS WELL AS OUR

06:14:54.104 --> 06:14:56.040
POSITIONS AND- THERE'S VERY

06:14:56.106 --> 06:14:58.275
LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT

06:14:58.342 --> 06:14:59.643
WOULD DRESS THOSE ACCESS ISSUES.

06:14:59.710 --> 06:15:01.812
I DO APPRECIATE- THE-

06:15:01.879 --> 06:15:05.816
GUARDRAILS THAT- THAT- AGAIN MY

06:15:05.883 --> 06:15:07.051
GOOD FRIEND RENDON PLACED ON

06:15:07.117 --> 06:15:08.018
THE BILL IN THE VARIOUS

06:15:08.085 --> 06:15:09.053
AMENDMENTS BUT I THINK IT'S

06:15:09.119 --> 06:15:10.321
IMPORTANT TO DROP PERHAPS A

06:15:10.387 --> 06:15:12.256
LITTLE BIT OF A COMPARISON

06:15:12.323 --> 06:15:12.756
BETWEEN EVEN WITH THESE

06:15:12.823 --> 06:15:15.593
GUARDRAILS. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

06:15:15.659 --> 06:15:17.528
A INDEPENDENT PRACTICING

06:15:17.595 --> 06:15:18.729
PHYSICIAN THE END OF HIM

06:15:18.796 --> 06:15:20.030
PRACTICING NURSE PRACTITIONER

06:15:20.097 --> 06:15:22.499
AND THE KIND OF GUARDRAILS

06:15:22.566 --> 06:15:23.100
ACTUALLY WE PLACE ON POSITIONS

06:15:23.167 --> 06:15:25.102
THEMSELVES. SO I WOULD POINT

06:15:25.169 --> 06:15:27.938
OUT THAT. ABOUT LOW OVER A

06:15:28.005 --> 06:15:30.407
HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT IN ORDER

06:15:30.474 --> 06:15:30.941
FOR A PHYSICIAN IN FAMILY

06:15:31.008 --> 06:15:33.510
PRACTICE THEY JUST HAD TO GO TO

06:15:33.577 --> 06:15:36.280
MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND THEN THE

06:15:36.347 --> 06:15:37.581
PUBLIC SAID WELL THAT'S NOT

06:15:37.648 --> 06:15:40.885
GOOD ENOUGH. SO ACTUALLY IN

06:15:40.951 --> 06:15:44.421
FACT- WE IS PHYSICIANS. HAVE TO

06:15:44.488 --> 06:15:45.689
COMPLETE FOUR YEARS OF POST

06:15:45.756 --> 06:15:48.092
GRADUATE EDUCATION WHICH IS

06:15:48.158 --> 06:15:50.394
MUCH LONGER THAN. THE

06:15:50.461 --> 06:15:51.862
UNFORTUNATELY THEN UNDER

06:15:51.929 --> 06:15:53.864
STRUCTURE CURRENTLY EVEN HAS TO

06:15:53.931 --> 06:15:55.866
GO THROUGH. HOWEVER THAT IN

06:15:55.933 --> 06:15:57.868
ITSELF IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO

06:15:57.935 --> 06:15:59.570
ALLOW A PHYSICIAN TO HAVE

06:15:59.637 --> 06:16:02.439
INDEPENDENT PRACTICE. AND SAID

06:16:02.506 --> 06:16:04.141
IT BY LAW HERE IN THE STATE OF

06:16:04.208 --> 06:16:06.644
CALIFORNIA. YOU D. TO COMPLETE

06:16:06.710 --> 06:16:08.078
A RESIDENCY PROGRAM. THREE

06:16:08.145 --> 06:16:10.748
YEARS. YOU CANNOT IN THE FAMILY

06:16:10.814 --> 06:16:12.983
PRACTICE IS THE PHYSICIAN UNTIL

06:16:13.050 --> 06:16:13.617
YOU'VE COMPLETED THREE YEARS OF

06:16:13.684 --> 06:16:18.088
RESIDENCY. SO AGAIN YOU'D HAVE

06:16:18.155 --> 06:16:18.622
TO ACTUALLY DO A LOT MORE

06:16:18.689 --> 06:16:20.658
CLINICAL TIME BEFORE YOU CAN

06:16:20.724 --> 06:16:25.763
GET TO BE SURE TO THAT POSITION.

06:16:25.829 --> 06:16:27.965
EVEN AFTER YOU FINISH THAT

06:16:28.032 --> 06:16:30.668
THREE YEARS OF CLINICAL ALFA OF

06:16:30.734 --> 06:16:31.735
MOUNTING MEDICAL FOR YEARS

06:16:31.802 --> 06:16:32.436
MEDICAL SCHOOL THREE YEARS OF

06:16:32.503 --> 06:16:34.405
RESIDENCY. AFTER YOU COMPLETE

06:16:34.471 --> 06:16:37.675
THAT. USE THAN AND OR TO BE

06:16:37.741 --> 06:16:39.643
ABLE TO PRACTICE- HAVE TO GET

06:16:39.710 --> 06:16:41.578
BOARD CERTIFIED. IN THAT BOARD

06:16:41.645 --> 06:16:43.547
CERTIFICATION IN FACT IS NOT

06:16:43.614 --> 06:16:46.150
FOREVER. IN FACT THAT POINT OUT

06:16:46.216 --> 06:16:48.085
THAT IN ORDER FOR ME TO

06:16:48.152 --> 06:16:49.486
CONTINUE TO PRACTICES PHYSICIAN.

06:16:49.553 --> 06:16:51.155
EVERY TEN YEARS I HAVE TO

06:16:51.221 --> 06:16:52.389
RECERTIFY AND THERE'S NO

06:16:52.456 --> 06:16:53.624
REQUIREMENT THAT THE NURSE

06:16:53.691 --> 06:16:55.392
PRACTITIONER HAS TO READ BE

06:16:55.459 --> 06:17:00.130
REEVALUATED. IN THE SAME WAY.

06:17:00.197 --> 06:17:01.265
AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER

06:17:01.332 --> 06:17:02.700
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION FACT I

06:17:02.766 --> 06:17:04.301
ASKED ABOUT IT TO COMMITTEE AND

06:17:04.368 --> 06:17:06.070
THE AND THE AUTHOR DID NOT GIVE

06:17:06.136 --> 06:17:09.340
A STRAIGHT ANSWER. SO THERE ARE

06:17:09.406 --> 06:17:11.075
MANY MORE REQUIREMENTS BEING

06:17:11.141 --> 06:17:13.677
PLACED ON A POSITION. NOR TO

06:17:13.744 --> 06:17:14.979
PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY THEN

06:17:15.045 --> 06:17:16.680
THERE ARE ON THE NURSE

06:17:16.747 --> 06:17:17.247
PRACTITIONERS EVEN WITH THE

06:17:17.314 --> 06:17:20.651
GUARDRAILS. FINALLY I DO WANT

06:17:20.718 --> 06:17:22.319
TO SHARE PERHAPS A THIS THIS

06:17:22.386 --> 06:17:25.923
THIS TRUE STORY. THE TRUE STORY

06:17:25.990 --> 06:17:29.493
THAT- AS THAT- WHEN I WAS IN

06:17:29.560 --> 06:17:32.863
THE CLINIC AND UNFORTUNATELY-

06:17:32.930 --> 06:17:34.331
WE HAD WHAT WE HAD PATIENTS AND

06:17:34.398 --> 06:17:35.366
WE HAD A YOU KNOW A NURSE

06:17:35.432 --> 06:17:36.867
PRACTITIONER THERE WONDERFUL

06:17:36.934 --> 06:17:38.602
NURSE PRACTITIONER- GOOD GOOD

06:17:38.669 --> 06:17:40.104
FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE.

06:17:40.170 --> 06:17:41.839
EXPERIENCED OVER A DECADE OF

06:17:41.905 --> 06:17:44.308
CLINICAL PRACTICE- AS A NURSE

06:17:44.375 --> 06:17:47.044
PRACTITIONER. AND SHE SAW A

06:17:47.111 --> 06:17:49.146
PATIENT WHO CAME IN WHO I CAME

06:17:49.213 --> 06:17:50.114
IN FOR PNEUMONIA AND

06:17:50.180 --> 06:17:51.682
APPROPRIATELY TREATED DIAGNOSED

06:17:51.749 --> 06:17:53.817
AND TREATED THE PNEUMONIA. AND

06:17:53.884 --> 06:17:54.852
THEN THE PATIENT HAD TO COME

06:17:54.918 --> 06:17:56.253
BACK A COUPLE TIMES FOR FOLLOW

06:17:56.320 --> 06:17:57.821
UP WITH THE PNEUMONIA. AND SO

06:17:57.888 --> 06:17:59.390
SHE NOW ONLY SAW THE NIZHAL SHE

06:17:59.456 --> 06:18:01.191
SAW THE PERSON THE FOLLOW UP

06:18:01.258 --> 06:18:02.860
THEN FINALLY THIS SEPARATION IS

06:18:02.926 --> 06:18:04.495
ALSO SEEN FOLLOW UP BY A

06:18:04.561 --> 06:18:06.830
RESIDENT PHYSICIAN. PRESENT

06:18:06.897 --> 06:18:08.132
POSITION BY THE WAY IS NOW OUT

06:18:08.198 --> 06:18:12.970
INDEPENDENTLY PRACTICE HAS. TO

06:18:13.037 --> 06:18:13.504
BE SUPERVISED. AND THAT.

06:18:13.570 --> 06:18:16.040
RESERVES'S NOTICED. A

06:18:16.106 --> 06:18:16.540
NEUROLOGICAL SIGN IN THE

06:18:16.607 --> 06:18:20.377
PATIENT. THAT WELL WAS NOTED BY

06:18:20.444 --> 06:18:21.979
THE NURSE PRACTITIONER SHE NOT

06:18:22.046 --> 06:18:22.479
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WAS

06:18:22.546 --> 06:18:25.315
ACTUALLY A SIGN. OF A TUMOR. IN

06:18:25.382 --> 06:18:28.318
THAT PATIENT. OF COURSE I IS

06:18:28.385 --> 06:18:30.921
THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN. WHO

06:18:30.988 --> 06:18:33.390
HAD TO GO AND- SUPERVISE THAT

06:18:33.457 --> 06:18:35.125
RESIDENT OF COURSE CONFIRMS

06:18:35.192 --> 06:18:38.295
THAT THAT WAS THE CASE. NOW

06:18:38.362 --> 06:18:39.296
PROBABLY EVENTUALLY WOULD HAVE

06:18:39.363 --> 06:18:40.330
BEEN FOUND OUT BECAUSE THAT

06:18:40.397 --> 06:18:41.565
NURSE PRACTITIONER AT THE TIME

06:18:41.632 --> 06:18:43.367
BECAUSE OUR CURRENT LAWS

06:18:43.434 --> 06:18:45.402
ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE SUPERVISED.

06:18:45.469 --> 06:18:47.037
SO THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN IN

06:18:47.104 --> 06:18:48.439
THE END IN REVIEWING THAT CASE

06:18:48.505 --> 06:18:50.874
I WOULD HAVE NOTED IT. AND THEN

06:18:50.941 --> 06:18:52.609
FILE THE WAY TO GET IT BUT I

06:18:52.676 --> 06:18:54.745
THINK THAT IS THE CHALLENGE

06:18:54.812 --> 06:18:56.613
RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW IT'S A

06:18:56.680 --> 06:18:58.816
FAIRLY RARE BRAIN TUMOR SO IT'S

06:18:58.882 --> 06:19:00.084
NOT SOMETHING WHERE HE DID A

06:19:00.150 --> 06:19:01.785
SMALL STUDY PICK IT UP THAT

06:19:01.852 --> 06:19:04.088
SOMEONE MISSED THAT DIAGNOSIS.

06:19:04.154 --> 06:19:04.588
AND I THINK WE NEED TO

06:19:04.655 --> 06:19:06.457
RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU KNOW THOSE

06:19:06.523 --> 06:19:07.991
THOSE ARE ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE

06:19:08.058 --> 06:19:09.226
WHO DEMANDED THAT PHYSICIANS BE

06:19:09.293 --> 06:19:11.428
HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THE MANY

06:19:11.495 --> 06:19:13.263
WAYS THAT YOU KNOW BEFORE WE

06:19:13.330 --> 06:19:14.364
CAN INDEPENDENTLY PRACTICES

06:19:14.431 --> 06:19:16.834
POSITIONS. AND SO I DO THINK

06:19:16.900 --> 06:19:19.636
THAT UNFORTUNATELY- BECAUSE OF

06:19:19.703 --> 06:19:22.473
PATIENTS I DO- AND CONCERNS

06:19:22.539 --> 06:19:25.909
THAT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL

06:19:25.976 --> 06:19:26.543
STILL DESPITE ALL YOUR EIGHT IF

06:19:26.610 --> 06:19:28.812
YOU SEE THE HARD WORK- IS NOT.

06:19:28.879 --> 06:19:32.116
DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH AND WE

06:19:32.182 --> 06:19:33.851
JUST EVEN COMPARED THE

06:19:33.917 --> 06:19:35.219
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO. IN

06:19:35.285 --> 06:19:37.054
TERMS OF INDEPENDENT PRACTICE

06:19:37.121 --> 06:19:39.123
AND WHAT THAT BASICALLY HAVE TO

06:19:39.189 --> 06:19:40.190
OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK THANK

06:19:40.257 --> 06:19:42.526
YOU SENATOR MOVING TO OUR

06:19:42.593 --> 06:19:44.461

WITH THE NURSE PRACTITIONER.

06:20:18.595 --> 06:20:21.732
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE.

06:20:21.798 --> 06:20:24.568
BILLS WHERE YOU TRULY DO SEE

06:20:24.635 --> 06:20:26.870
BOTH SIDES OF THIS ARGUMENT AND

06:20:26.937 --> 06:20:29.206

06:20:32.776 --> 06:20:34.745
CAN ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE. SO

06:20:34.811 --> 06:20:40.350
HERE'S- MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT

06:20:40.417 --> 06:20:43.020
IN THE VALLEY WE HAVE A MASSIVE

06:20:43.086 --> 06:20:45.355
SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS RIGHT IN

06:20:45.422 --> 06:20:47.424
THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS IS A

06:20:47.491 --> 06:20:49.493
PROBLEM SO WE'RE HAVING

06:20:49.560 --> 06:20:51.828
EXPANDED AUTHORITY FOR NURSE%

06:20:51.895 --> 06:20:53.697
PRACTITIONERS COULD BE A GOOD

06:20:53.764 --> 06:20:56.099
THING IT WOULD NCREASE ACCESS

06:20:56.166 --> 06:20:57.801
TO HEALTH CARE FOR

06:20:57.868 --> 06:21:01.438
UNDERPERFORMING COMMUNITIES ARE.

06:21:01.505 --> 06:21:05.542
MINORITY POPULATED COMMUNITIES

06:21:05.609 --> 06:21:07.110
AND SO THAT IN AND OF ITSELF.

06:21:07.177 --> 06:21:09.746
HE IS APPEALING ON THE FLIP

06:21:09.813 --> 06:21:13.050
SIDE ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT

06:21:13.116 --> 06:21:13.584
I'VE HEARD IS THAT IF YOU

06:21:13.650 --> 06:21:16.420
EXPERIENCE. THE ROLE OF NURSE

06:21:16.486 --> 06:21:18.655
PRACTITIONERS YOU WILL FURTHER

06:21:18.722 --> 06:21:21.225
ALIENATE. THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF

06:21:21.291 --> 06:21:23.493
THE AREA TO PHYSICIANS TO

06:21:23.560 --> 06:21:26.763
DOCTORS. OTHERS IN THAT'S AN

06:21:26.830 --> 06:21:28.999
INTERESTING IDEA SO YOU'RE

06:21:29.066 --> 06:21:30.934
ATTRACTING MORE FOLKS TO HELP.

06:21:31.001 --> 06:21:33.237
OUR COMMUNITY BUT ULTIMATELY

06:21:33.303 --> 06:21:34.238
YOU'RE TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE

06:21:34.304 --> 06:21:35.539
TALENT THAT IS NEEDED AS AS

06:21:35.606 --> 06:21:38.342
WELL. AND SO I'M LIKE WELL WHAT

06:21:38.408 --> 06:21:40.177
EXACTLY DOES A POSITION TO WIN

06:21:40.244 --> 06:21:41.878
THEIR THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN

06:21:41.945 --> 06:21:43.680
ENTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR

06:21:43.747 --> 06:21:45.382
OVERSEEING- NURSE

06:21:45.449 --> 06:21:47.651
PRACTITIONERS. I KIND OF HAVE

06:21:47.718 --> 06:21:49.686
THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD THAT IT'S

06:21:49.753 --> 06:21:51.154
SOMEBODY IN THE CORNER OR DOWN

06:21:51.221 --> 06:21:53.657
THE HOLE IN THE CLINIC OR THE

06:21:53.724 --> 06:21:55.025
HOSPITAL ORWHATEVER THE

06:21:55.092 --> 06:21:57.094
SITUATION MAY BE WHERE. THEY'RE

06:21:57.160 --> 06:21:58.762
ACTUALLY CONSULTING WITH ONE

06:21:58.829 --> 06:22:01.198
ANOTHER REGULARLY AND MAKING

06:22:01.265 --> 06:22:02.733
CERTAIN THAT THE NURSE

06:22:02.799 --> 06:22:04.201
PRACTITIONERS RECOMMENDATIONS

06:22:04.268 --> 06:22:07.271
AND IN ACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE

06:22:07.337 --> 06:22:08.739
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ONLY TO

06:22:08.805 --> 06:22:11.241
FIND OUT THAT THAT RARELY

06:22:11.308 --> 06:22:14.444
ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN FACT- ONE

06:22:14.511 --> 06:22:17.214
CONVERSATION AGAIN. THE DOCTOR

06:22:17.281 --> 06:22:19.383
WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY. AND

06:22:19.449 --> 06:22:21.485
STILL SATISFIED THE NEED IN

06:22:21.551 --> 06:22:23.453
THAT SITUATION OF TECHNICALLY

06:22:23.520 --> 06:22:24.488
OVERSEEING THE NURSE

06:22:24.554 --> 06:22:27.057
PRACTITIONERS IN THIS FACILITY.

06:22:27.124 --> 06:22:31.862
SO I APPRECIATE SCOPE OF WORK

06:22:31.928 --> 06:22:35.565
AND IT IS IMPORTANT I ALSO WANT

06:22:35.632 --> 06:22:36.433
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE'S

06:22:36.500 --> 06:22:39.870
ENOUGH FOLKS IN THE WORK FORCE

06:22:39.936 --> 06:22:41.905
THAT CAN SATISFY THE NEEDS OF

06:22:41.972 --> 06:22:44.574
OUR OF OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS

06:22:44.641 --> 06:22:47.044
REALLY A FIFTY FIFTY IN MY

06:22:47.110 --> 06:22:49.546
OPINION. HEARING WHAT DOCTOR

06:22:49.613 --> 06:22:53.684
PAN HAD SAID THAT. ALLOWING

06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:55.352
FOLKS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH

06:22:55.419 --> 06:22:57.387
THE RIGORS IN CERTIFICATIONS

06:22:57.454 --> 06:23:00.290
AND LICENSURE OF BEING-

06:23:00.357 --> 06:23:06.096
PHYSICIANS. HAS BENEFITS AND. I

06:23:06.163 --> 06:23:07.831
THINK WHAT I'M I'D LIKE TO WITH

06:23:07.898 --> 06:23:10.867
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY BUT I

06:23:10.934 --> 06:23:13.870
THINK THE ULTIMATE NEED IS

06:23:13.937 --> 06:23:17.941
ALREADY SATISFIED IF PHYSICIANS

06:23:18.008 --> 06:23:19.776
DON'T HAVE TO BE PRESENT. AND

06:23:19.843 --> 06:23:21.578
THEY CAN STILL SATISFY WHATEVER

06:23:21.645 --> 06:23:24.614
IS NECESSARY. IS THIS BILL

06:23:24.681 --> 06:23:28.418
TRULY NECESSARY. SO I'M M. I'D

06:23:28.485 --> 06:23:29.052
LIKE TO HEAR WHAT MY COLLEAGUES

06:23:29.119 --> 06:23:31.521
HAVE TO SAY BUT THIS IS IT'S A

06:23:31.588 --> 06:23:33.056
FASCINATING SUBJECT AND- I'D

06:23:33.123 --> 06:23:34.758
LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE THANK

06:23:34.825 --> 06:23:41.798

EIGHT NINETY I'M READING

06:23:48.372 --> 06:23:50.307
SURVEYS OF MEDICAL DOCTORS WHO

06:23:50.374 --> 06:23:52.275
ARE PLANNING TO RETIRED SOONER

06:23:52.342 --> 06:23:55.879
THAN ANTICIPATED. THIS CALL MAY

06:23:55.946 --> 06:23:56.947
NINETEEN LOCKDOWN HAS HAD

06:23:57.013 --> 06:23:58.348
NUMEROUS NEGATIVE

06:23:58.415 --> 06:24:00.817
REVERBERATIONS. I'VE ALSO

06:24:00.884 --> 06:24:02.152
OBSERVED HOW NURSE

06:24:02.219 --> 06:24:04.087
PRACTITIONERS TO BE A HUGE

06:24:04.154 --> 06:24:06.957
ASSIST TO GENERAL PRACTITIONERS

06:24:07.023 --> 06:24:09.526
SO MUCH CAN BE ADDRESSED FOR

06:24:09.593 --> 06:24:11.928
NUMEROUS COMMON AILMENTS.

06:24:11.995 --> 06:24:14.297
CONSEQUENTLY THIS PROVIDES A

06:24:14.364 --> 06:24:15.665
SOLUTION TO A DECLINING

06:24:15.732 --> 06:24:17.501
WORKFORCE WHILE ASSISTING

06:24:17.567 --> 06:24:19.069
RESIDENTS WITH MEDICAL ADVICE

06:24:19.136 --> 06:24:21.838
BUT BASIC NEEDS AS RELIEF TO A

06:24:21.905 --> 06:24:23.407
GROWING NEED. I APPRECIATED IN

06:24:23.473 --> 06:24:25.575
ANY OF THE EMAILS  RECEIVE I

06:24:25.642 --> 06:24:27.511

AND OVERWORKED DOCTORS. I'M NOT

06:24:47.764 --> 06:24:48.999
SURE HOWEVER IF COME FROM WITH

06:24:49.065 --> 06:24:51.201
THE BORDER NURSING SYMBOL MEANT

06:24:51.268 --> 06:24:52.636

THEIR TRACK RECORD BUT I'LL

06:24:54.237 --> 06:24:55.806
LEAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER TIME BUT

06:24:55.872 --> 06:24:57.240
I'M SURE PATIENTS WILL KNOW THE

06:24:57.307 --> 06:25:00.477

THIS BILL IS A PRETTY DIFFICULT

06:25:16.259 --> 06:25:18.895
BILL BECAUSE SAM. I DO THINK

06:25:18.962 --> 06:25:21.164
THAT- ALLOWING PEOPLE TO

06:25:21.231 --> 06:25:22.399
PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICAL

06:25:22.466 --> 06:25:24.835
PROCESS MIGHT HELP US- GET

06:25:24.901 --> 06:25:27.871
ACCESS TO RURAL HEALTH CARE.

06:25:27.938 --> 06:25:30.040
LIKE WHERE WE HAVE IN THE

06:25:30.106 --> 06:25:30.640
VALLEY WE NEED ACCESS TO REAL

06:25:30.707 --> 06:25:32.375
HEALTH CARE. I ALSO AM

06:25:32.442 --> 06:25:33.844
CONCERNED ABOUT QUALIFICATION

06:25:33.910 --> 06:25:35.412
PIECES AND MAKING SURE THAT

06:25:35.479 --> 06:25:38.348
INDIVIDUALS ARE QUALIFIED TO DO

06:25:38.415 --> 06:25:40.884
THE WORK. I DID HEAR FROM BOTH

06:25:40.951 --> 06:25:42.652
SIDES OF THE AISLE BUT I DO

06:25:42.719 --> 06:25:43.687
HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND

06:25:43.753 --> 06:25:44.921
THEN SOME QUESTIONS AND MAYBE

06:25:44.988 --> 06:25:46.223
THE AUTHOR COULD ANSWER MENTOR.

06:25:46.289 --> 06:25:48.758
IN THE CLOSE. AND YOU KNOW I

06:25:48.825 --> 06:25:50.060
GUESS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A-

06:25:50.126 --> 06:25:51.661
CHANCE ON A BILL LIKE THIS WE

06:25:51.728 --> 06:25:53.930
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT'S

06:25:53.997 --> 06:25:55.131
GOING TO WORK. AND THAT WE

06:25:55.198 --> 06:25:56.333
DON'T SET UP OUR RULE

06:25:56.399 --> 06:25:58.835
UNDERSERVED DISTRICTS- FOR

06:25:58.902 --> 06:26:01.271
LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. THERE IS

06:26:01.338 --> 06:26:03.139
A PROPOSITION I BELIEVE IT'S

06:26:03.206 --> 06:26:06.409
PROP FIFTY SIX. BIT GIVE US

06:26:06.476 --> 06:26:08.678
MANY TO INCENTIVIZE- DOCTORS

06:26:08.745 --> 06:26:09.980
LIKE REAL DOCTORS MEDICAL

06:26:10.046 --> 06:26:11.648
PROVIDERS TO COME TO THE REALLY

06:26:11.715 --> 06:26:12.482
REASON SERVE ENTER SEARCH

06:26:12.549 --> 06:26:15.585
COMMUNITIES. I GUESS MY CONCERN

06:26:15.652 --> 06:26:17.954
IS LIKE I SAID. I KNOW THAT

06:26:18.021 --> 06:26:19.389
WITH THE IMPACTS OF CODED A WE

06:26:19.456 --> 06:26:20.557
DO HAVE A LOT OF DOCTORS THAT

06:26:20.624 --> 06:26:22.626
ARE YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR SEVEN

06:26:22.692 --> 06:26:24.828
AND HELP. COULD BE BENEFICIAL.

06:26:24.895 --> 06:26:26.363
BUT I ALSO AND LIKE I SAID VERY

06:26:26.429 --> 06:26:27.764
CONCENED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF

06:26:27.831 --> 06:26:30.734
CARE AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT-

06:26:30.800 --> 06:26:32.235
THE EDUCATION EXPERIENCE IN THE

06:26:32.302 --> 06:26:33.770
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES BEHIND

06:26:33.837 --> 06:26:36.039
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT- PROVIDING

06:26:36.106 --> 06:26:37.140
THAT CARE. IN THE ROLE

06:26:37.207 --> 06:26:38.708
COMMUNITY WOULD THINK THAT THIS

06:26:38.775 --> 06:26:40.010
BILL MIGHT PROVIDE A LOT OF

06:26:40.076 --> 06:26:42.279
NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO. COME TO

06:26:42.345 --> 06:26:44.014
THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR IN RURAL

06:26:44.080 --> 06:26:45.282
AREAS SUFFER MY COLLEAGUE FROM

06:26:45.348 --> 06:26:48.652
DEEPER REPRESENTS. BUT IS THAT

06:26:48.718 --> 06:26:50.954
THE SAME AS HAVING A DOG.

06:26:51.021 --> 06:26:51.821
THAT'S GONE THROUGH TRAIN. AND

06:26:51.888 --> 06:26:54.291
GONE THROUGH A RESIDENCY AND

06:26:54.357 --> 06:26:56.126
GONE THROUGH YOU KNOW

06:26:56.192 --> 06:26:57.594
ADDITIONAL CLASSES THAT

06:26:57.661 --> 06:26:59.396
ADDITIONAL- LIKE EXPERIENCE

06:26:59.462 --> 06:27:01.598
TRAINING I GUESS YOU'D SAY LIKE

06:27:01.665 --> 06:27:02.832
EXPERIENCE ON THE JOB- THE

06:27:02.899 --> 06:27:03.967
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION RISK

06:27:04.034 --> 06:27:06.002
PRACTITIONERS HAVE A POLICY.

06:27:06.069 --> 06:27:08.138
THAT REJECTS ANY PROVISION

06:27:08.204 --> 06:27:09.406
WHICH MAY INCENTIVIZE NURSE

06:27:09.472 --> 06:27:10.840
PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE AND

06:27:10.907 --> 06:27:14.144
RURAL. UNDERSERVED AREAS- SO I

06:27:14.210 --> 06:27:15.412
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE

06:27:15.478 --> 06:27:16.613
TO THINK THEY'RE THAT NURSE

06:27:16.680 --> 06:27:17.847
PRACTITIONERS ARE GOING TO WANT

06:27:17.914 --> 06:27:18.949
TO COME TO THIS. TO THE RURAL

06:27:19.015 --> 06:27:20.817
AREAS THAT I REPRESENT. AND I

06:27:20.884 --> 06:27:23.920
WAS WONDERING WHY THAT WASN'T

06:27:23.987 --> 06:27:24.854
ALLOWED TO BE IN THAT BILL. AND

06:27:24.921 --> 06:27:26.690
THEN I'M LOOKING AT THE MAPS

06:27:26.756 --> 06:27:29.993
WITHOUT SUPERVISION FROM THE

06:27:30.060 --> 06:27:32.128
FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS. AS

06:27:32.195 --> 06:27:33.563
THEY REALLY DON'T GO TO

06:27:33.630 --> 06:27:37.934
UNDERSERVED AREAS- WHEN YOU

06:27:38.001 --> 06:27:38.535
REMOVE THE SUPERVISION SO WHY

06:27:38.602 --> 06:27:39.970
THERE TEN CENTER NURSE

06:27:40.036 --> 06:27:41.972
PRACTITIONER. TO AT LEAST IN

06:27:42.038 --> 06:27:44.207
RURAL AREAS LIKE WE DO FOR

06:27:44.274 --> 06:27:47.677
PHYSICIANS- THREE PROP FIFTY

06:27:47.744 --> 06:27:49.713
SIX SO I KNOW THAT- PHYSICIANS

06:27:49.779 --> 06:27:53.016
ARE DO THEIR TRAINING- IN RURAL

06:27:53.083 --> 06:27:55.018
AREAS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS

06:27:55.085 --> 06:27:57.420
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES- SO

06:27:57.487 --> 06:27:59.589
I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHY. AND WE

06:27:59.656 --> 06:28:00.991
DIDN'T HOW LOUD THAT IN THIS

06:28:01.057 --> 06:28:03.226
BILL AND THEN IF IT'S SUPPOSED

06:28:03.293 --> 06:28:04.628
TO CREATE INCREASED ACCESS TO

06:28:04.694 --> 06:28:06.029
CARE ESPECIALLY FOR A MEDICAL

06:28:06.096 --> 06:28:08.331
POPULATION- WHY ISN'T THERE AN

06:28:08.398 --> 06:28:09.733
INK WHY ISN'T THERE ANY

06:28:09.799 --> 06:28:12.335
INCREASED AND UTILIZATION COSTS

06:28:12.402 --> 06:28:14.237
FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM- ON ANY

06:28:14.304 --> 06:28:17.340
OF THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE BEEN

BUDGET BILL BUT THE LIFE WE CAN

08:09:50.260 --> 08:09:52.796

I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE BUT I

08:15:17.854 --> 08:15:19.923
JUST HAVE TO EXPRESS ON THIS IS

08:15:19.990 --> 08:15:21.224
THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

08:15:21.291 --> 08:15:25.228
PRODUCING RESULTS. FOR STUDENTS

08:15:25.295 --> 08:15:25.762
AND SELF FOR THE FACT THAT

08:15:25.829 --> 08:15:27.564
THAT- THE STATE'S DEPRIVING

08:15:27.631 --> 08:15:28.899
THEM OF THE FUNDS THEY NEED TO

08:15:28.965 --> 08:15:31.401
OPERATE- IF THEY'RE PENALIZING

08:15:31.468 --> 08:15:33.203
OUR PARENTS AS WELL AS THEIR

08:15:33.270 --> 08:15:35.906

FOUR DECADES FORTY YEARS I

10:38:43.685 --> 10:38:46.254
THINK IT IS AND I'D THAT

10:38:46.321 --> 10:38:47.889
DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY SENSE

10:38:47.956 --> 10:38:49.290
TO ME WHY WE WANTED TIE THE

10:38:49.357 --> 10:38:51.559
HANDS OF FUTURE LEGISLATURES

10:38:51.626 --> 10:38:54.429
WITH RESPECT TO THIS FEES IN

10:38:54.496 --> 10:38:56.431

AND- PREVENT DIVERSION OF THESE

10:39:03.071 --> 10:39:05.206

10:39:05.273 --> 10:39:06.374
NINE PROTECTS ONLY TO REVENUE

10:39:06.441 --> 10:39:09.244

10:39:15.216 --> 10:39:17.686
FUND THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE.

DIVERT AND SO I JUST I DON'T

10:39:20.288 --> 10:39:22.290
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DO

10:39:22.357 --> 10:39:24.492
THIS TO FUTURE LEGISLATURE- AND

10:39:24.559 --> 10:39:27.529
