TO LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE WORKED

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:55.025
AND INTO THE BILL -- THE THE

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:59.663
OTHER -- LANGUAGE THAT I HEARD

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:02.932
WAS -- MERCHANTS TO SHELTER --

00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:04.000
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:05.335
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT CALLS

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.070
THIS AN EMERGENCY SHELTER BUT

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.471
THIS IS DECIDEDLY NOT.

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:10.907
OF AN EMERGENCY SHELTER WHICH

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.776
LEADS ME TO MY LAST AND I THINK --

NOW -- ACTED IF I BECOME

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:24.554
DESPONDENT WHEN I THINK THAT WE

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:28.091
ARE -- USING PARKING LOTS TO

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:31.795
ALLOW -- PEOPLE SAFE PLACE -- TO

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.297
BE IN THEIR CARS OF NONE OF US

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:36.633
SHOULD THANK THAT A CAR IS

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.835
ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUB STANDARD

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.003
HOUSING.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.440
AND WHEN WE OF MIKE MY CONCERN

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:49.879

CONTEXTS? TO NORMALIZE -- THE

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.487
THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE THE

00:55:57.554 --> 00:56:00.123
GOVERNMENT SHOULD -- ALLOW

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.825
PEOPLE TO LIVE IN SUBSTANDARD

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:04.094
HOUSING -- AND I THINK IT SAYS

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.529
SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ON

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:07.764

STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER IT'S

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:54.277

CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT. FOR

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.409

HEARTEDLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.060

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:14.997
CONSIDER.

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.199
A 50% OF A FIVE MEMBER BOARD IS

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.734
TWO AND A HALF WOMEN.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.069
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO AND A

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.370
HALF PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY.

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.439
THAT BEING SAID ON THE SAME FIVE

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:24.807

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.408
MEMBER WOULD NOW MAKE UP.

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:27.609
THREE OF THE TOTAL NUMBERS WHICH

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.511

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:31.080
REPRESENTATION.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:32.347
WE CAN AGREE THAT DIVERSITY

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:33.415
ACTUALLY BRINGS ABOUT DIFFERENT

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.484
IDEAS.

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.452

THE PERSON 50% ROLE AS

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:39.888
PROBLEMATIC.

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:40.489
I WOULD PROPOSE THAT WHEN THE

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.924
BOARD IS COMPRISED OF FIVE

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.991
MEMBERS.

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.626
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD MANDATE

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.528
AT LEAST TO BE WOMEN.

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:48.797
SIMILARLY WHEN THE BOARD HAS.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:49.465
SEVEN THREE SHOULD BE WOMEN WITH

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:50.432
NINE MEMBERS.

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.000
AND FOR SHOULD BE WOMEN AND SO

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:54.837
ON THIS DOESN'T RESTRICT OTHER

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:55.437
WOMEN FROM BEING APPOINTED TO

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:56.472
THE BOARD.

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.273
IT SIMPLY SHOWS THAT A GROUP

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.908
