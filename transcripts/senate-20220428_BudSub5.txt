OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP NEXT WE HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM COALITION ON FAMILY UNITY- I THINK WE HAVE. OF MUDDY MORE AND JOHN BUSCAS AND LAYLA AZIZ. I DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THE OF THE THREE OF YOU. GOOD MORNING I WAS START THANK YOU. FOR HAVING ME MY NAME'S FREE MORE I WORK WITH THE PLACE FOR GRACE WE WORK WITH FAMILIES IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS IS CAN'T GREAT TO FIVE DAY. RT MUSIC BASED PROGRAM WHERE WE TAKE CHILDREN S. RIGHT PRESENT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR FATHER WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THEIR CARE GIVER. THIS IS ONLY DONE AT THREE INSTITUTIONS ONE OF THE KIDS ONLY SEES A STEP THROUGH CALGARY'S. AND THAT IS ONCE A YEAR. BARRICADING THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM IS CHALLENGING IN THE BEST OF TIMES AS OF ONES ARE REGULARLY TRANSFER TO DIFFERENT PRESENCE OR HOUSING UNITS WITH DIFFERENT RULES AND POLICIES BUT TRYING TO ACCESS INCARCERATED LOVED ONES DURING THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN BRUTAL AND- DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE THE BUS RIDES THAT WERE PROMISED THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED MANY CHILDREN CANNOT SEE THEIR PARENTS TO THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF GOING TO BUSINESS SOMEONE WHO IS INCARCERATED CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE THE SILENT VICTIMS ON AVERAGE A FAMILY MEMBER CAN SPEND UP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS ON TWO DAYS OF VISITS IF THEY ARE VISITING AN INSTITUTION. WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS FROM THEM THAT NUMBER RISES SIGNIFICANTLY FOR PRESENCE MUCH FURTHER. HI BUSES BEEN IMPLEMENTED MORE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO SEEING THEIR PARENTS. ANOTHER VERY YEAR IS VISITING APPLICATIONS. ELIGIBLE PERSON DISCLOSES THAT THEY HAVE HAD A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CDC ARE STILL RUNS THE DOJ. LOCAL COURTS AND POLICE STATIONS ARE ARE ONLY REQUIRED BY LAW TO KEEP RECORDS LONGER THAN SEVEN YEARS THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE ONCE YOU SEE OURS DOJ REPORT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE THAT THERE IS AN ARREST FOR JAY WALKING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND HIS GRANDMOTHER CANNOT REMEMBER. THEREFORE CDCR DENIES THIS PERSON FROM RE APPLYING RIGHT AWAY AND DOES NOT DISCLOSE WHY THEY WERE DENIED IT'S PLAYING A GAME OF GUESS WHAT NO CLUES ARE GIVEN. THIS HAS GIVEN WHEN GRANDPARENTS WHO OPTION OTHER CARE GIVERS FOR OUR CHILDREN- CANNOT TAKE THEIR GRANDCHILDREN TO SEE THEIR PARENTS. THIS COULD ALL BE AVOIDED OF CDCR DISCLOSED INFORMATION FOUND ON THE D. O. AND ASK FOR CLARIFICATION IF THEY FELT IT WAS NECESSARY. TO ADD TO THAT IF THEY DID NOT. IF THEY DID NOT DENY THE APPLICANT FOR SIX MONTHS AND ALLOW THEM TO. IMMEDIATELY RE APPLY. IT CAN OUT FURTHER THIS. ISSUE VISITING A SUCH AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO REHABILITATION HOW CAN CARCERI PEOPLE BUILD. A STRONG SUPPORT SYSTEM WITH CDCR IS CONSTANTLY PUTTING THESE OBSTACLES WHEN THEY COULD EASILY BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THE SECURITY OF THE US TUITION. FURTHERMORE WE CAN ALL AGREE HERE THAT MY PRESENCE ON HERE ON VIDEO SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DESCRIBED AS A VISIT. VIDEO CALLS ARE NOT VISITS WE DO APPRECIATE THE ACCESSIBILITY TO OUR LOVED ONES THAT WAS SCHEDULED VIDEO CALL. WITH KOBE WE HAVE ALL LEARNED TO IT AND ADJUSTED. MOST OF US CAN AGREE THAT THE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES TO SEE SOMEONE THROUGH VIDEO AND IN PERSON IS MUCH DIFFERENT. JOYCEAN FOLKS FACES WHEN THEY SEE EACH OTHER IN. PERSON AS OPPOSED TO A SCREEN. IT IS VERY BIG. ARCADE WANT TO HELP THEIR DAD THERE MY THEIR UNCLE OUR KIDS ASKING WHERE WERE CAN I WHY CAN I SIT NEXT TO MY DAD WHY CAN I PLAY JUNGLE HIM WHY CITIES ARE SAYING THAT WE HAVE THREE VISIT DATES WHEN I ONLY SEE HIM FOR TWO DAYS AND THE OTHER ONE IS A VIDEO CALL IT'S NOT A VISIT WHY CAN I HOLD MY DAD'S HAND. HELLO CAN BAY HAS FIGURED IT OUT AND IS THE ONLY INSTITUTION THAT HAS THREE IN PERSON VISIT DAYS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RUNNING VIDEO CALLS WHY CAN ALL OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT THE SAME SYSTEM IN MOTION WHY CAN- WHY CAN ALL IT- WE CLEARLY. HOW IT CAN BE DONE AND I DO NOT SAY THIS- SO THAT THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY CAN BE RIPPED AWAY FROM PUBLIC IN BASIC FAMILY MEMBERS. I SAY THIS TO ASK YOU SEE ARE TO ASK FOLLOW THEIR INSTITUTIONS TO DO THE SAME. IF YOU ASK PRESENCE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE. WHEN VISITS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN DUE TO OUR RACE ONLY TWO DAYS OR SOMETHING BUT INSTEAD OF THE THREE. THE FUNDS WERE GIVEN TO HAVE THREE DAYS THIS IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW. FAMILY REUNIFICATION IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR A LOW POINT FOR INCARCERATED TO HAVE A STRONG SUPPORT SYSTEM. SO MANY FAMILIES UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY DISCONNECTED DUE TO COPE WITH. MANY MARRIAGES HAVE ENDED COMMUNICATION ANY RELATIONSHIP WHETHER PROFESSIONAL OR PERSONAL IS IT- COMMUNICATION IS A KEY FACTOR. THE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO SCHEDULE VISITS IS NOT WORKING MEMORY MANY FAMILIES HAVE SWITCH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST SPEED. IT IS NOT FRIENDLY FOR FAMILY MEMBERS FOR NOT TECH SAVVY OR DISABLED. WE APPRECIATE THE STAGGERING OF APPOINTMENTS BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH WHEN YOU TO SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR FAMILIES. WHO CANNOT ACCESS THE INTERNET FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED PHONE APPOINTMENTS THAT WERE USED IN THE PAST ARE NO LONGER IN PLACE WE NEED TO STOP CAUSING FURTHER TRAUMA TOWARD CHILDREN. WE NEED TO STOP. CAUSING FURTHER TRAUMATIZED FAMILIES A STRONG SUPPORT SYSTEM LOWERS RECIDIVISM RATES WE NEED THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MORE- ARE OTHERS GOING TO BECAUSE WELL OKAY- JOHN VASQUEZ. GOOD MORNING CHAIR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME. FOR COMMUNITIES UNITED FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE I'M ALSO FOR MANY PARTS RATED I SERVED OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A JUVENILE LIFER AND HAVE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE ON THE CHALLENGES FRUSTRATIONS AND HARMFUL BARRIERS THAT EXIST WITHIN CITY SEE OURS BIDDING PROCESS I CURRENTLY SUPPORTS SEVERAL FAMILIES WITH INCARCERATED LOVED ONES. WHO TIME AND TIME AGAIN REPORT DIFFICULTIES OF NOT BEING ABLE TO VISIT THEIR LOVED ONES IN PERSON. THESE BARRIERS INCLUDE LACK OF CONSISTENT IMITATION OF A THIRD IN PERSON VISITING DAY LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION OF TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES UNABLE TO AFFORD THE HUGE AND BURDENSOME COSTS OF TRAVELING EXPENSES. LACK OF VISITING SPACE PROVIDED BY THE INSTITUTIONS LACK OF BASIC SCHEDULES PROVIDED BY THE VSA SYSTEM PUNITIVE DENIALS OF VISITING DUE TO INVERNAL. OR INACCURACIES ON A PERSON'S DATING APPLICATION AND CURATIVE RESTRICTIONS OR DENIALS OF INCARCERATED PERSONS ABILITY TO VISIT DUE TO DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS FOR NON VISITING RELATED INFRACTIONS. THESE HARMFUL. COURSE VISITING ARE NOT NEW BUT IN FACT HAVE EXISTED FOR SEVERAL DECADES PRIMARILY AFTER THE REPEAL OF VISITING AS A WRITE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX DURING THE SO CALLED TOUGH ON CRIME PARA WHICH HISTORY SHOWS WAS HARMFUL AND COSTLY TO SOCIETY AND ONLY LED TO MASS INCARCERATION. RESEARCHERS SHOWS THAT IN PERSON VISITING IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF REHABILITATION. AND CHILDREN SHOULD NOT HAVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TOWARD VISITING THEIR PARENTS. AS LONG AS VISITING IS SEEN AS NOTHING MORE THAN A PRIVILEGE. THESE HARMFUL BARRIERS WITH VISITING WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH MONEY IS GIVEN TO C. C. R. TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS CAN ACCESS TO VISITING. THAT'S WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO IMPROVE THE VISITATION PROCESS WE MUST ALSO DISCUSS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. WHICH IS THE DENIAL OF AN INCARCERATED PERSONS RIGHT TO HAVE A PERSONAL BUSINESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU RESTAURANTS BECAUSE- WE HAVE NEXT LAYLA AZIZ. YES MY NAME IS HI YES MY NAME IS LEILA AZIZ I LIVE IN SAN DIEGO I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PILLARS OF THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO A RE ENTRY AND RESPONSIBLE FATHER FATHERHOOD EXPERT FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. AFTER WORKING SIXTY HOURS A WEEK DEALING WITH HOMEWORK AND EXTACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES YOU WAKE UP AT FIVE THIRTY AM. YOU POUR YOURSELF A CUP OF COFFEE YOU MAKE SURE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION IS SECURE YOU MAKE SURE NOTHING ELSE IN YOUR HOME IS USING A WIFI CONNECTION. AT FIVE FIFTY YOU BEGIN TO LOG IN. YOU PRACTICE GOING TO THE CORRECT PAGE AS FAST AS YOU CAN YOU MAKE SURE NO OTHER APPLIANCE IN THE HOME IS USING WIFI. AT FIVE FIFTY NINE AM YOU BEGIN YOUR COUNTDOWN. YOU SET YOUR PHONE TO SIXTY SECONDS YOU LOG IN AND NAVIGATE TO THE RIGHT PAGE BEFORE YOU SOLIDIFY THE BASE STATE YOU'RE SHAKING. YOUR BREATHING HARD YOUR BRAIN AS SOON AS YOUR TIME IS A FIFTY EIGHT SECONDS YOU BEGIN NAVIGATING TO THE NEXT PAGE YOU PICK YOUR TOP YOU SELECT THE AGREE BUTTON WHEN YOU PRESS CONFIRM BASED SYSTEM SLOWS DOWN. AND BEGINS CLOCKING YOUR BROWSER SHOWS THAT SOMETHING IS LOADING BUT LOTUS FLOWER. IF YOU DO THIS PERFECTLY. YOU HAVE AN 80% CHANCE OF GETTING A BUSY. IF YOU ARE ALL IF YOU WERE DISABLED IF YOU ARE NOT MOVING AT THE SPEED OF SOUND IF YOU MAKE ONE MISTAKE IF YOU FAIL TO CHECK OFF ONE. BOX IF YOU MISS ONE SECOND YOU WILL NOT GET A VISIT. I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY AFTER WAKING UP THREE MONTHS. AND NOT GIVING A VISIT. MY NAME IS LAYLA IS THE ON THE WAY OF AN- PERSON. I LIVE IN SAN DIEGO CA. MY HUSBAND IS. AT HIGH DOES STATE PRISON FIVE HUNDRED IS. EIGHT MILE AWAY. OUR STORY IS SIMILAR TO MANY OTHER PRISON DOWN. I COLLEGE PRISON FAMILIES BECAUSE DECISION CDCR MAKES DIRECTLY IMPACTS. OUR CHILDREN AS WE FIGHT WITH EVERY BONE. IN OUR BODY TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES TOGETHER. MY TWIN BOYS LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THEIR DAD. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VERY WELL BEHAVED AT SCHOOL THEY STRUGGLE WITH READING. DURING VISITS MY HUSBAND WORKS WITH THE BALL ONE ON ONE. CREASED A LETTER C. SKILLS THEY LOVE HIM. THEIR EAGER TO PLEASE AND I ALWAYS RISE TO THE CHALLENGE. THEY LOVE THE INTENTION EVEN IF IT'S DURING THAT LEAST FAVORITE SUBJECT. THE RESEARCH ON CHILDREN MAINTAIN PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THEIR- INCARCERATED PARENTS IS SCARCE. WHAT I HAVE SEEN TWO IF NOT PLEASE IN QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCES IS THAT CHILDREN WHO MAINTAIN A PHYSICAL CONNECTION. WITH THEIR PARENTS DO BETTER IN SCHOOL. HAVE BETTER BEHAVIOR HAVE A BETTER SELF ESTEEM AND UP WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE POLICY INSTITUTE JUST HIRED A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ERIC. WAS THE CHILD OF A FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSONS ERIC'S MOTHER DID HER BEST TO ENSURE HER SON HAD PHYSICAL CONTACT. WITH HIS FATHER. HER SON IS ENROLLED IN BERKLEE FORCE MASTER'S DEGREE AND IS LEADING ONE OF THE STRONGEST ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO EXPAND IN PERSON BUSINESS AT LEAST THREE DAYS A WEEK. AND BELIEVE THE VISITING TO AT LEAST THREE DAYS A WEEK. IF WE KNOW A PRACTICE OF KEEPING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES APART. IS AN AWFUL PRACTICE WHICH HARMS CHILDREN. WHY WOULD WE MAINTAIN AND WORK DURING THE WEEK STRUCK BY US. YES SAFETY. IN RETURN THEY DON'T HAVE THE BILL TO SEE THE LOVED ONE. CHILDREN DESERVE JUST TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS. CDCR TEAMS TO SEND A CARD WITH PEOPLE FAR AWAY FROM THE LOVED ONES. MY HUSBAND'S DIED SHE FOR HER. MY TO BE UP. I COST MY FAMILY NINE HUNDRED TO FLY TO READ OUT IN THE- TO SUSAN CA. WHERE HIGH DESERT. IF WE DRIVE ACROSS WORKING DOLLARS. A TYPICAL DRIVERS TWELVE HOURS AFTER GAS AND STOP. OUR HOTEL ROOM THERE ARE NO. IS A HUNDRED. FOR THE WEEKEND. WE SPEND AT LEAST NINETY DOLLARS IN THE BEEN THE MACHINE DURING ALL DAY VISIT. THERE'S AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER VISIT EVERYTHING GOES WELL. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIAL BROCK. HAS TO BE DONE A CERTAIN WAY IN A CLOSE UP TO FIT A CERTAIN WAY. THESE ADJUSTMENTS CAN USUALLY OUT ON TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EVERY VISIT. THANK EVERYTHING IS PERFECT A FAMILY NORMALLY FROM POOR WORKING CLASS ENVIRONMENTS WILL ONLY SEE THEIR LOVED ONE WAS PER MONTH WILL SPEND. 800-800-0400 ANNUALLY. A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE WILL EQUAL FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS AMOUNT EQUALS AN EXCELLENT CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR FOUR OH ONE K. PLAN UP OR DOWN PAYMENT ON A WHOLE. WE WILL NEVER SEE THIS INVESTMENT. WE FIGHT TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN ARE NEVER HOUSE BEHIND THESE WALLS WE LIMIT THEIR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND TRAUMA. WE GIVE THEM NORMAL IN THE MOST ABNORMAL PLACE WE KNOW THAT LEAVING OUR CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF OTHERS IS THE OPPOSITE OF SAFETY. IT WOULD BE CHEAPER BUT COULD COST AMERICAN AFFECTS. THE PRISON VISITATION ROOM IS ONE OF THE SAFEST PLACES IN THE WORLD. IT IS SAFER THAN A LIBRARY IT IS SAFER THAN A CONCERT IT IS EVEN SAFER THAN A CHURCH RESEARCH THE DATA. THERE ARE NO INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE EVEN ARGUING IN A PRISON VISITING ROOM. LATELY HIGH DESERT STATE PRESIDENT ONLY BEEN OFFERING. WATER TO VISIT- SITTING IN A BUSY ROOM FIRST. HOURS LOCKED IN. WITH NOTHING TO EAT. IF WE WERE TRULY A- TO MAY. FAMILIES THE PERSON WOULD HAVE A BEEN DIFFICULT. FRESH FOOD WITH BE ABLE PLAY A- ON THE- FOR THESE THREE. TO GET FOR AIR. OF CHILDREN. VISITING HIS. WORLD FOR STEP OUR- OR FOR SPARE. OF HUNDREDS DOLLARS TO LEAVE EARLY FOR FOOD. IS AN- PROCESS BUILDER TOXIC IF TALKS. IS TOXICITY. IN THE BODY OF. YOU COGNITIVELY. PHYSICALLY AND- INSTEAD CDCR SMALL CHILDREN TO SIT ALL. HOURS WITH ONLY WATER. IF YOU WERE MAMA. YOU KNOW THAT HEARING MOMMY I'M HUNGRY. TWENTY TIMES AS A STEP. ON WATER IT'S HEARTBREAKING. I THE ARMATURE REMOVE OF VISIT BASED ON ISSUES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO WITH. HARM OUR- I CHILD SENIOR PARA SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN AS A LUXURY. IT IS A MESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH MISS AZIZ- WHEN I TRY TO LOG ON TO MY COMPUTER ON MY LAPTOP I'M SCARED TO DEATH I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO. GET THROUGH OR I'M GOING TO BE DROPPED I'M GOING TO PUSH THE WRONG BUTTON SO. I HAVE A TINY IDEA OF WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW AND- OPEN THE QUESTIONS TO MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE SENATORS. CENTER CORTESE- TH THANK YOU MANAGER A YES SIR ON THIS TOPIC IN FACULTY ASSUME SEGUE FROM THE LATEST COMMENTS IN THE IN THE PER ONCE- SO IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHEER I WANTED TO SHARE SOMETHING- THAT MY WIFE- SENT ME A BULLET POINTS WILL TAKE A MINUTE- SHE HAPPENS TO BE- HE A MENTOR- FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS NOW. HE INCLUDING FOLKS IN THE JAIL AND PRISON SYSTEM- AND SHE JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE COMPLAINING TO ME A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE- TRYING TO. COMPLETE IF YOU WILL- VISIT- AN ONLINE VISIT A VIDEO VISIT AS SHE CALLS IT SO IT IS AGAIN JUST TAKE A SECOND YES- AND I THINK IT VALIDATES SOME OF WHAT WE JUST HEARD SO MAYBE THERE'S SOME VALUE THERE- THE CURRENT PRICE THIS IS. I'M STARTING NOW. THE CURRENT PROCESS TO SIGN UP FOR A VIDEO VISIT IS. LOG IN AT SIX TWENTY NINE AM. EXACTLY SIX TWENTY NINE NOT SIX TWENTY EIGHT OR SIX THIRTY- SIX TWENTY NINE AM ON SATURDAY MORNING FOR VISITS THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY. VISITS CANNOT BE SCHEDULED EARLIER IN THE SIX THIRTY AM SATURDAY. SELECT THE NAME OF THE INMATE TO INMATE TO VISIT HIM PRESS QUOTE SCHEDULE VISIT BUTTON AT SIX THIRTY PRECISELY. IF TOO EARLY. I GET A MESSAGE SAYING VISITS CANNOT BE SCHEDULED UNTIL SIX THIRTY IF I'M EVEN A FEW SECONDS LATE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM CRASHES FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER THAT. IN PERSON VISITS ARE AVAILABLE BUT NOT VIDEO BUSINESS SO THEN I HAVE TO WAIT ENTER WEEK TO TRY AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY VIDEO VISITS THEY ALLOW BUT IT'S CURRENTLY NOT ENOUGH- SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT. YEAH IT'S SORT OF INDIRECT TESTIMONY YOU CAN TAKE THAT AS- FOR AGAIN FULL DISCLOSURE- AS MY WIFE OF PADDY CORTEZ WHO SHARE THOSE COMMENTS BUT- OVER THE COMMITTEE WILL RECEIVE THAT AS- CONSTITUENT. A TESTIMONY- BECAUSE SHE DID JUST EMAIL ME THIS THIS MORNING- KNOWING THAT WE WOULD BE IN THIS COMMITTEE HEARING WONDERSHARE THEN IT ALSO AT SOME POINT LIKE TO HEAR. A RESPONSE TO THAT WHOLE. HOW IS IT CONSIDERED TO BE APPROPRIATE ACCESS OF COURSE ISN'T WHAT WE NEED TO DO- IT TO MOVE TO A MORE ACCESSIBLE SYSTEM. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. WITH THIRD NEWMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NOW ARE YOU WE WANT TO HEAR. A RESPONSE YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD. OKAY IF YOU DON'T MIND GO HEAD I THINK IT'S ALL CONNECTED RIGHT SO OKAY- YOU KNOW TO LAY LOW AS CALM AS HE WITH THAT'S- EIGHT YOU KNOW INHUMANE IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK OF AN ANSWER NOT NOTHING IS PERFECT UNDERSTAND THIS STRETCH DURING THE PANDEMIC WE SET UP NEW SYSTEMS- BUT CLEARLY YOU KNOW IF THAT'S THE LIFT THE LIMITING FACTOR IS TECHNOLOGY SOMEBODY HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO. FIX THAT- THE THING I'M I'M I'M I ACTUALLY LIKE TO TOUCH ON ALSO IS. PHONE CALLS RIGHT IMMEDIATE THE SO. NOT REALLY CLEAR WHY. LET ME START SO YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY IS HARDER TO BILLS SYSTEMS BUT CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES ARE TOTALLY MATURE. AND PHONE CALLS OFFICIALLY FREE ALRIGHT SO IT SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT WE'RE STILL RATIONING. TIME YOU KNOW VIA VOICE ON THE PHONE- BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A COMMODITY THAT. COST ANYTHING- AND IT'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW YOU COULD PROVIDE MORE AND FULLY ENRICH THE LIVES NOT ONLY INMATES BUT THEIR FAMILIES- IN WAYS THAT. MIGHT TAKE SOME THE PRESSURE OF. THESE OTHER SYSTEMS SO- YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO HEAR AN ANSWER AT A IF THERE ARE. OBSERVE BUDGETARY NEEDS WE NEED TO. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THIS COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN DRESS THEM. BUT IT SHOULD BE IT'S NOT- OKAY TO DILLY DALLY RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE NOW- AND THAT IS JUST A- SHOCKING SITUATION THAT THE YOU KNOW THE- YOU'VE GOT A FIVE SECOND. INTERVAL AT THE DETERMINES WHETHER YOUR SON CAN CONNECT WITH HIS FATHER- THEN WE SHOULD ALLOW THAT NIGHT THAT LED TO HEAR ANSWERS TO HOW WE FIX IT GO BACK TO- CDC ARE ND- MR CLUB I DON'T KNOW WHO WILL WANT TO ANSWER. EACH OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING THIS IS CHRIS MONTGOMERY AYE AYES AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE- THIS INFORMATION SERVICES I CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THE VIDEO OUR SCHEDULING. APPLICATION I UNDERSTAND THIS HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHEN WE FIRST IMPLEMENTED IT THERE WERE PERFORMANCE ISSUES- THAT WE WORK WITH OUR VENDOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. FIX THOSE- ON PERFORMANCE ISSUES- AND THAT WAS IT EARLY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH AND MAKE COUNCIL THAT WE- EIGHT LIVE IN MAY COUNCIL TO GET THEIR FEEDBACK. IMPROVE THE APPLICATION. OF ONE OF THE SUGGESTION WAS OFFER STAGGER SCHEDULING NOW WHICH WE HAVE WOMEN IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE- WE DIVIDE THE INSTITUTIONS BETWEEN NORTHERN. CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN- WE START TIMES OF. SIX SIX THREE AND SUB. I SUGGESTION WAS TO BUY MINIMUM WAS DISCUSSION THEY TRY TO A VISIT AND THEN THEY WOULD IT WOULD JUST STOP AND LIKE- AND AS YOU HEARD. PROBABLY CROSS OR IT JUST DIDN'T SEE MY ANYTHING HAPPENING. ARE WE READY TO PROVIDE BETTER MESSAGING THAT SAYS YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS FULL OR YOU KNOW YOU TO TRY A DIFFERENT TIME. THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AGAIN WE CAN TO WITH STATE WHY IN MAY COUNCIL FOR SUGGESTIONS AND IMPROVE. AND WILL CONTINUE. TRY TO IMPROVE THE APPLICATION. BEFORE. AND IF YOU COULD MISS FUND CONDUCTED IF YOU ON VOICE ON VOICE COMMUNICATIONS AND SO THE UNDERSTAND YOUR WRITING YOU'RE RUNNING AN ENTERPRISE. DEPARTMENT BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY WOULDN'T VOICE WE SHOW THAT STATES FREE AT WHATEVER LEVEL YOU KNOW AGAIN. CONSISTENT WITH YOU KNOW IN MAY SCHEDULES BUT WOULD WHAT WHY WOULD BE LIMITED TO IT TO SOME INCREMENT. AGAIN- THE VOICE WHICH IS I'M ASSUMING YOUR PHONE CALLS AS AS I DISCUSSED WE ARE OFFERING- FREE FARM CALLING AND THAT'S UP TO. SIXTY MINUTES EVERY TWO WEEKS SO WE DO OFFER FREE CALLING FROM CALLING TO OUR BUT BUT WHY WHY ONLY SIXTY MINUTES AT THIS POINT FUNDING FROM THE BUDGET ACT TO COST AND SO IF YOU COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY LOOK WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE INCREMENTAL COSTS THAT YOU INCUR. BY IF YOU ADDED MORE MINUTES THAT THAT'S THE THING THAT PUZZLES ME ABOUT ABOUT BACK ON QUITE VOICE PROPERTY PHONE CALLS- AGAIN THE COST PER PHONE CALL IS. THERE A FULL RATES ARE TWO POINT FIVE CENTS PER MINUTE. IS WHAT THE COST IS THE UNIT COSTS SO- I DON'T HAVE THE LIKE THE INCREMENTAL THAT YOU JUST ASKED ME I'D HAVE TO DO THE MATH. AND THAT TOO BUT FOR SAYS IT'S BASED ON WHAT EXISTING CONTRACT WITH THE VENDOR YES YES IT'S AN EXISTING CONTRACT WITH FIVE POCKET COLLEGES I GUESS I'D I'D SUGGEST LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE VENDORS WE COULD GET. MORE FOR YOUR MONEY BUT- I'M SURE YOU'RE DOING THAT THANK YOU. PLEASE YES PLEASE. THANK THANK ABOUT YOUR- OWN THEY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD THAT THE REPORT THAT I JUST READ IN. OF FROM PATTY CORTEZ HE WAS THIS MONTH SO- I HEARD LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY AS TO. THE ATTEMPTED CORRECTIVE MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OF GOING BACK IT SOUNDS LIKE WELL INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO MAYBE EVEN TWENTY TWENTY BUT- THESE ARE EXPERIENCES THE LAST TWO SATURDAYS. OF THIS MONTH PRIOR TO. TO THIS WEEK SO- IF THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THINGS ARE FIXED ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO CREDIT WITH YOU. WITH BEING VERY CANDID SAYING STEGER SCHEDULING SPIN ATTEMPTED- THE RESPONSE TO CRASHES. HAS BEEN BETTER MESSAGING THAT. APPARENTLY THAT THE SYSTEM'S CRASHED IN YOU NEED TO TRY. NEXT WEEK WHICH I DON'T THINK SUCCESSFUL GOING BACK TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES COMEDY COMMENTS. MEANS BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE- YOU SEE THAT YOU KNOW. THE CDC ARE THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO ME TO TRY TO DEAL WITH IT BUT- I THINK THE URGENCY THAT I'M SENSING RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE NEED TO BRING SOMEBODY ELSE IN- YOU KNOW TO ASSIST WITH THAT BE AN AUDIT. OR- THE L. A. O. OR OR SOME OTHER. A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY CAN GET RIGHT TO THE PROBLEM I THINK THIS ONE THE SITUATIONS WHERE- THE GOOD PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE. WHO IS INVOLVED IN A DIFFERENT- A DIFFERENT SECTOR SAYS. WE HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THIS GOAL RIGHT TO THE KERR. IMAGES YOU JUST NEED TO GO RIGHT TO THE CURE OR WEEK. IT'LL IT WITH PEOPLE'S RIGHTS ARE AT STAKE IN THESE KIND OF- ACCESS PROBLEMS OR OR ISSUE I THINK- YOU KNOW EVEN EVEN THE SUGGESTIONS OF AUDIT IN AN OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE SMACK OF FURTHER ANALYSIS RATHER THAN JUST. ON FIXING THE PROBLEM IS CENTER NEW INTEREST SAID- SO THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS I REALIZE IT DOESN'T. AND THIS IS AN ACTION. ITEM TODAY BUT- YOU KNOW I I'M I'M JUST GONNA TO FURTHER DEVELOP THOSE THOUGHTS I GUESS BASED ON WHAT I HEARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- ANY- DO YOU HAVE ANY- MISSLING GO MARIE DO YOU HAVE ANY. RESPONSE TO WHAT. SENATOR CORTEZ HE JUST RAISED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT- AGAIN WHAT WILL WORK WITH OUR VENDOR ON IF THEY'RE SEEING THESE ISSUES OF CRASHES AND THAT TYPE OF THING- IT'S- I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT WILL CERTAINLY LOOK INTO IT. SO IF I COULD JUST ADD A FEW MORE THINGS- THE THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON VISITING WHICH SEEM TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY HAS TESTIFIED TO IN PERSON. IS THE- PREFERENCE THAT FAMILIES HAVE FOR THE CHILDREN BEING ABLE TO VISIT PARENTS OR- IS THAT AT ALL INSTITUTIONS RIGHT NOW OF A THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON VISITING- AND IF NOT WHY NOT AND WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. ALSO MET MANAGER PERFORMANCE- ARE NOT THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON YEAH. WE GOT GETS USED. OF THE OPTIONS THERE SOME BAND WITH THE- THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH OUR TO DO. THIS THING DURING- WE WITH- FOR TENNIS. ARE. IT'S NOT IN PERSON IS IN APT WELL ALL OF OUR ANSWERS TO IT CAN YOU TELL ME WHICH INSTEAD THERE ARE THREE D. OF A PERSON. OKAY SOMEONE. SO AT CERTAIN AND I DON'T THE EXACT ONES. BUT THERE ARE WHEN THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT WAS- UP. SMALL HOME OF THIS NUMBER ORDER- THIS ONLINE. BIG DEAL OUT OF TO HAVE THANKS TO. OKAY THIS IS NOT QUITE A- QUITE A OF A VERY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION- ISN'T CAN MISS MONTGOMERY SHOULD HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT PROGRAM. RIGHT. I CAN ANSWER ANY VIDEO IF YOU ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VIDEO CURSING OKAY OKAY I'M THRILLED DAYS OF IN PERSON WOULD BE. YEAH I MEAN ISN'T THAT THAT THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON VISITING ISN'T THAT- THE REQUIREMENT OR THE GOAL RIGHT NOW. SO IN DISCUSSION WITH OUR YOU KNOW I ISSUE MY IT SEEMS TO HAVE- IN THE LOCAL IT SEEMS VIDEO BUSINESS HAVE BEEN REALLY POPULAR- IN SO TO A POINT WHERE FOLKS. CAN GET HOME WE CAN TALK WITH THEIR LOVED ONES CHAU THINGS ARE GOING ON HOMES. VIDEO MISSING HAVE BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL. AND SO. IN THE VIDEO VISITS ARE. IN THE- AND SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE TO OVER THE SAME TIME. OKAY BUT THE END OF A SUCCESSFUL AND I CONGRATULATE IF THERE'S A SUCCESSFUL. VIDEO VISITING- PROGRAM BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THAT THREE DAYS IF THAT IS THAT THREE DAYS- OF IN PERSON VISITING IS THAT PER. MONTH OR HOW HOW OFTEN IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE- WEEK. SO THIS WAS TO BE THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON VISITING PER WEEK- AND WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WHICH INSTITUTIONS THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING THE. I WAS TOLD THAT IT'S JUST ABOUT. CHRISTENSEN THAT'S THE ONLY PRISON THAT IS PROVIDING THE THREE AYS PER WEEK VISIT YES. OKAY AND DO YOU KNOW WHY OR CAN YOU EXPLAIN AGAIN WHY IS IT NOT TAKING PLACE AT THE OTHER PRISONS. SO AND WITH ISSUES ARE CURRENTLY S. R. INSTITUTIONS DON'T HAVE BACK ISSUES HI AM NOT A NINETEEN VOTE I'M PERSONS ARE AT AS FAR AS WHAT'S- AND DURING THE WEEK DAYS OUR SEARCH. I'M SORRY YOU'LL HAVE TO REFER TO WHO. MY COLLEAGUE CHRISTMAS AND WHICH OKAY MISS MONTGOMERY. SO THE QUESTION THAT I'M HEARING IS THE THREE DAY IN PERSON VISITING VERSUS VIDEO VISITING- NOT NOT NOT VERSES BUT OKAY IN ADDITION IN ADDITION THIS IS THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON VISITING. PROVIDED OKAY- SO. AGAIN THAT'S NOT MY PROGRAM I YOU KNOW AFTER. REFER TO TODAY ON- IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON VISITING- AND NOT THE VIDEO VISITING. IT FOR IMPLEMENTING MATTER IF IT'S MAINLY BECAUSE OF OUR WE'RE SHARING THE ROOMS BETWEEN. AND I APOLOGIZE AND SO I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MORE VIDEO VISITING AND I APOLOGIZE FOR IT SO THE REASON THE REASON IS THAT WE USE THE SAME AREAS SO WE'RE VIDEO VISITING WERE ALSO USING- THAT IS OCCURS IN THE SAME ROOM AS THE- IN PERSON BUSINESS. AND SO IT TAKES THE COMPUTERS AND ALL THAT STUFF TAKES UP SPACE- FOR US TO CONDUCT IN PERSON MEETING WITH A VISITING. OKAY WELL. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO SUBSTITUTE I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME SITUATIONS WHERE THEY MAY BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR SOME BUT FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE GOTTEN AND WHAT WE'VE OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED THIS IS NOT THE IN PERSON VISITING IS NOT OR THE REMOTE VIDEO REMOTE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE IN PERSON AND SO I THINK WE KEEP I KEEP HEARING FROM YOU IS HOW SUCCESSFUL THE VIDEO CONFERENCING- VIDEO VISITING IN BUT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO SUBSTITUTE- AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE SET UP FOR- OVERSIGHT TODAY. AND I REALLY EXPECTED OF THE RESPONSES TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLETE THAN WHAT WE'RE GETTING- WITH REGARDS TO TRANSPORTATION- ARE ALL THE INSTITUTIONS OFFERING TRANSPORTATION. ALL THE ONES THAT ARE ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING- IN PERSON- TRANSPORTATION CM SIXTY SEVEN YARDS ALSO WANTS TO SELL OUT. OKAY DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS. SO WE'VE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING- A CONTRACTOR WILL. DIFFICULTIES ON WHOSE PART- MOSTLY ON THE BITTEREST PART- NOT IT- HAVING THE- THE CORRECT DOCUMENTS THE CORRECT- HAVING THE CORRECT OF. ABILITY TO PROVIDE WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING- IF IT IS A LOT TO GO FROM- IN AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- TO ALL TO ALL THIRTY FOUR INSTITUTION. AND SO WHAT IS YOUR TIMELINE TO DO TO GET THERE WE'RE OPEN BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHERE YOU EXPECT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS YES. I'M SORRY BYE BYE JULY FIFTEENTH THE END OF TWENTY TWO. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT TO HAVE THE CONTRACTS SIGNED TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CORRECT OKAY- MISTER GUMM REYES IT'S NOT IT MY INFORMATION IS THAT ONLY A PORTION OF THE MONEY ALLOCATED FOR FREE PHONE CALLING HAS BEEN SPENT- IF THAT'S TRUE CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS- AND HOW HAVE YOU MADE OF THE PEOPLE AWARE THAT THE MINUTES ARE AVAILABLE- AND IS THERE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE PHONES AVAILABLE. I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE MADELINE CLEANING THAT MADELINE OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS NATALIE W. TRACTOR FISCAL SERVICES FOR CCR A SO YOU ARE CORRECT WE HAVE EXPENDED APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE FREE. THAT MESSAGING- WE'RE ANTICIPATING TO SPEND ABOUT TWO POINT THREE MILLION THIS FISCAL YEAR ANY ANY FUNDING THAT IS NOT USE WILL BE REFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND- AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE- OF INTERNET INCARCERATED PERSONS ARE ALLOWED TO USE THE PHONES- DURING THEIR NORMAL TIMES WE'RE NOT RESTRICTING THE USAGE OF. OTHER PHONE CALLS. US SO WE ARE. THE THEY'RE UTILIZING IT WE CAN SEE THERE YOU'LL THEY GET A HUNDRED TWENTY- THROUGH THIS. THROUGH THE BOOK OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED BY ACT- AND THEY'RE ALSO USING THE EMAIL MESSAGING IT'S JUST NOT AS MUCH AS WE HAD ORIGINALLY BUDGETED FOR WOMEN WHEN THIS WAS- ADDED TO THE BUDGET LAST YEAR WAS TOO LATE IN THE PROCESS AND WE CAME UP WITH AN- ESTIMATED AMOUNT. BASED ON A CERTAIN POPULATION LEVELS THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT OPERATES AMOUNT VERSUS WHAT WE GET SPEND TO PROVIDE THE MESSAGING AND EMAILS THAT LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION. YES SO THE MONEY WAS VERY IT WAS PERSPECTIVE IN THE BUDGET ACT AND IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC ALLOWING FOR THAT FREE PHONE CALLS AND EMAIL MESSAGES AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE USING IT FOR AND SO THAT COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN PUT OUT TO ALL INCARCERATED PERSONS AND THEY ARE USING- BUT IS THAT WE'VE SEEN HIM- SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE USAGE OF A MINUTE AND- I EMAIL MESSAGES OVER. OVER PREVIOUS TAX BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS FREE OPTION OKAY AND THEN- I'M I'M NOT SURE WHO WOULD ANSWER THIS BUT WITH THE BIG THERE WAS TESTIMONY ABOUT. THE APPLICATION PROCESS TO GET OF A VISIT. THAT THEIR- A LOT OF. COMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE PRESENTED BUT- OF THE FAMILIES DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO GET PAST THOSE PROBLEMS THEY DON'T IDENTIFY WHAT THE ISSUE IS. TO DO THAT DENIES THEM THE VISITATION- COULD SOMEONE RESPOND TO THAT. IS THIS IN REGARDS TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE RULES YES. OKAY THEN. SO I WOULD BE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. IF THERE IS ANY QUESTIONS THAT THIS NEED TO CONTACT AWARD AT SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONS- TO FIFTEENTH AT REASONS WHY. YOU MEAN EVERY INDIVIDUAL PERSON WHO RUNS ACROSS THAT PROBLEM NEEDS TO CALL THE WARDEN THEY CAN CONTACT THE WARDEN OF THE RIGHT THE LEVEL OF WORK WHICH YOU WILL HAVE. GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OVERALL- I MUST SAY I'M I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESPONSES THAT THIS COMMITTEE- HAS RECEIVED. OF IT WE KNEW WHAT THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS FOR THIS CONVERSATION WE KNEW THE PARTICULARS- ISSUES. THAT ARE FACING THE FAMILIES- AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO IT DOESN'T SEEM IT DOESN'T COME IN GET IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL LIKE THIS IS SUCH AN URGENCY OF FOR YOU MEANWHILE THE FAMILIES DEPEND ON YOU. TO BE ABLE TO VISIT TO BE ABLE TO SEEK TO BUILD FOR THE CHILDREN TO SEE THEIR PARENTS AND IN THIS LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION OF BEING ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT- THE DENIALS OF I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS. LIKE NOT THE MOST COMPLICATED THING IN THE WORLD TO RESOLVE BUT YEAH THIS IS GOING ON AND ON AND ON SO. MISTER GROW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS I FEEL VERY- I FEEL LIKE THE RESPONSES THAT YOU ALL SHOULD BE IN A BETTER PLACE. IN TERMS OF RESPONDING AND HAVING A REAL PLAN TO FIX IT OTHERWISE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING ON. MONTH AFTER MONTH AND EVEN YEAR AFTER YEAR. A MANAGER- I CONVINCING AYE CAN I TELL YOU IT IS IMPORTANT TO US- AND SO WE WILL DEFINITELY BE LOOKING. INTO WAYS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER- WE HAVE CONSTANT DIALOGUE WITH OUR STATEWIDE- INTERCONNECTIONS TOMORROW TO SEE WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS BORN TO US WE WILL BE LOOKING. AND I AND I SAY THAT- FOR THE GOOD OF EVERYBODY I MEAN WE WANT THESE. MEN AND WOMEN WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED TO BE- YOU KNOW AS STRONG AND SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED. AND THIS IS A VERY VERY CRITICAL PART OF THEM BEING ABLE TO BE IN THE BEST POSITION. TO TAKE WE TAKE. CHARGE OF THEIR LIVES SO I. I DON'T YOU KNOW IF IT'S A MATTER OF MONEY IF IT'S SOME WHAT WHAT IS IT PLEASE IDENTIFY THAT PLEASE LET US KNOW BECAUSE IT'S UP IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES IN THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE OTHER RESOURCES.

WITH GOOGLE THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY INDORSE EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID AND IT. APPS WE GET ASKED YOU KNOW GIVEN THE- THE NATURE OF THE SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW TIMING- BETWEEN MEETINGS DOESN'T ALWAYS LEND ITSELF TO SOME VERBAL FALL UP IN TESTIMONY THAT- THAT WE COULD. ASK FOR A WRITTEN REPORT BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALL MEMBERS INCLUDING THOSE NOT PRESENT TODAY- IS AS WELL AS TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OVERALL- THE WRITTEN REPORT AS TO WHAT PROGRESS IS MADE IN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS SO THAT THE REPORT WOULD BE BACK TO US IN THE THIRTIES AND WHAT WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF TIMING IS- THAT- MAY FIFTEENTH THIS COMING THE MAY REVISE IS COMING. I THINK HONOR ABOUT THE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEENTH- WE WILL BE. STARTING TO STUDY THAT. AND OKAY THEN AND TODAY IS- IN A TODAY'S THE TWENTY EIGHTH IT GIVES US YOU KNOW MAYBE TEN DAYS AFTER THE MAY REVISE- TO LOOK AT A REPORT. THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE WITHIN IF THAT'S MY THIRTY DAY TIME MEET RIGHT THAT WE RECEIVE ON THE PROGRESS AND I THINK THAT SHOWS SOME. WE CALLED HOPE I WILL. GO FURTHER THAN THAT- BUT THAT- CDCR IN THOSE WHO TOLD US TODAY THAT THERE'S GONNA BE FIXES BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR- GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO REPORT BACK TO LET US KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S BEEN FIXED WHAT HASN'T BEFORE WE GET TO THE END OF HIS CAREER BUT BUT MORE IMPORTANT BEFORE WE ADOPT THE NEW AT THE STATE BUDGET IN THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION SO I THINK I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S- ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AS AS THE CHAIR- I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD- VERY GOOD SUGGESTION AND I WOULD ONLY ADD.

THE VIDEO THE PHONE CALLING THE TEXTING THOSE IT SEEMS TO ME IS NOT ONE. OR THE OTHER IT'S ALL OF THOSE TOGETHER THAT. CREATES THE BEST A SITUATION FOR OUR FAMILY SO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY WITH OUR- INCARCERATED- MEN AND WOMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL NOW- MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWO IS OUR CONTROL SECTION TWENTY POINT ZERO ZERO A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD YOU. MAKE THE PRESENTATION. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON- GERMAN MERCER DO I'VE OVER THE PART OF FINANCE WILL GIVE INSPIRATION FOR BOTH YOUR CONTROL ACTION THAT IT AND REMIND TECHNICAL WORKLOAD THAT DEPARTMENT THAT FINANCED AND THE LEGISLATURE COMPARE EACH YEAR DURING THE ANNUAL BY DEFAULT THAT. WEAKENED PROTECTIONS TWENTY FOCUS ON STREAMLINING- PRETTY LIMITED COKE OF LANGUAGE ONLY RECREATION THAT REVERSION OF FEDERAL BY FOND AND. NON GOVERNMENTAL CALL. EACH YEAR MISTREATMENT. TECHNICAL THAT CONTAIN A LIST OF BOND AND NOT GOING TO LOOK A GROUP. AND- AND RIVER AGAIN AND THE IDEA BUDGET AT. LANGUAGES IS GREAT ONE EIGHT. BUT DOES REAL VERY DETAIL ENTERED OF HOW IT. IN ORDER FOR THE VEHICLE OFFICE TRACK THE PROCREATION AND REOCCUR. OR REAPER BE FUNDING AT THE FIVE AND EVEN IF I'M KEEPING THE A TYPO OR ERROR IN ELAINE OF AFTER THE FACT AND THEN APPLY OF THE GRANT- REFINANCE BETTER. OR AMENDMENT TO THE BILL IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE SMALL TECHNICAL CHANGE WORK WHICH FURTHER COMPLICATE THE- BELOW ONLY SOME OF THE PRICES THAT WE WORK FLOW OF THAT DEPARTMENT FIND A AND. AFTER THE DELAY. WARM FALL IN GETTING A COUPLE LANGUAGE. WITH THE FOR EACH YEAR DONE- REALLY BE OUR WHEN ONLY PERFORATION WHY DON'T- WHILE WE ARE THREE MY WORK WE ARE STILL A KIND OF LIKE TO THINK OVER OFF THE THROUGH THE- JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE WHERE YOU MISTER WITH THE TO PROVIDE- PRETTY MUCH OF. SIMILAR THAT WE FROM IN THE- TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUT COMMITTEE AND THE ABILITY TO- BUT COMMITTEE OF THE OF THE- REVERBERATEUNDER. POPULAR STILL I CAN PLAY A BIGGER I PROPERTY BUILT IN WITH EXT I DON'T IT OVER MY CAR- IF. ADD CREAM AROUND HER SUPPORT AND FINANCE AND I'M JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE BULK OF CITIES ARE PROJECTS ARE TYPICALLY GENERAL FUND FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL EVERY SINGLE. PROPOSAL THAT POINT TEN WAS GENERAL FUND SO MOST OF THE PROJECTS ARE GENERAL FUND AND CONTROL SECTION TWENTY WOULD NOT APPLY TO THEM WE DO HAVE ONE EXISTING PROJECT RIGHT NOW IT'S THE C. I. M. S. FIFTY BED AT MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES THAT ONE IS LEASE REVENUE BOND FUNDED. SO THAT IS ONE PROJECT THAT CONTROL TWENTY COULD APPLY TO YOU- AND THAT COVERS THE POINTS FROM FOR THE EXTENT OF HOW CONTROL SECTION TWENTY WHAT A FLYER COULD APPLY. TO YOU- CDCR AT THIS POINT IN TIME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SOMEONE FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE WHO'S WHO THAT GOING TO BE IS THAT CAITLYN MISSILE NEIL YES GOOD AFTERNOON HI HE WENT ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE FIND THAT THE IDEA OF STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR TECHNICAL AND NON CONTROVERSIAL BE APPROPRIATIONS AND REVERSION IT'S REASONABLE- HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT IN GENERAL I CAN BE MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT AT- TO PERFORM ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE THROUGH THE JAIL THE SHE PROCESS AS COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS- AND SO WE RECOMMEND BACK WITH WHATEVER- REVISED PROCESS IS- APPROVED SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE- BE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO IT- WE RECOMMEND ENSURING THAT THE PROCESS THAT PROVIDES A LEGISLATURE WITH THE NECESSARY TIME AND INFORMATION THAT IT NEEDS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. OF THE AFFECTED PROJECTS- AND THAT IT IS IT USES TRULY LIMITED TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE TECHNICAL AND NON CROP CONTROVERSIAL IN NATURE- AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER MODIFYING THE PROPOSAL IN THREE WAYS OR IN THREE KIND OF GENERAL CATEGORIES OF POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS. AND THOSE ARE ONE LIMITING THE TYPES OF PROJECTS TO THOSE THAT ARE TRULY- TECHNICAL AND NON CONTROVERSIAL IN NATURE FOR EXAMPLE. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- EXCLUDING PROJECTS AT PRISONS GIVEN THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THIS COMMITTEE AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT- HE DESIRES PLANNING FOR PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN LIGHT OF. THE DECLINE IN THE INMATE POPULATION AND POTENTIAL FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES- IT COULD ALSO- EXCLUDE. AT LEAST REVENUE BOND PROJECTS REGARDLESS OF DEPARTMENT THAT ARE OVER A CERTAIN DOLLAR THRESHOLDS THAT WOULD JUSTIFY GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE PROJECT- INCREASED OVERSIGHT FOR EXAMPLE- AND THEN THE SECOND AREA TO CONSIDER WOULD BE TIMING- SO. IT'S IN SPECIFICALLY IT IT TENDS TO BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW JAIL WE SEE NOTIFICATIONS DURING PERIODS OF PEAK BUDGET WORKLOAD. SUCH AS MAY REVISION- AND CONFERENCE. SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER REQUIRING THAT THESE NOTIFICATIONS ARE SUBMITTED PRIOR TO MAY FIRST EVERY YEAR. AND THIRD ON THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER WHAT INFORMATION IS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH EASE ON VACATIONS- AND AS WAS STATED THE- OUT HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO PROVIDE- WITH THE JAIL BC NOTIFICATIONS- CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT IT CURRENTLY PROVIDES THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS. HOWEVER IN THE INTEREST OF FUTURE POLICYMAKERS- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER MEMORIALIZING THAT INTENT BY REQUIRING A DEAL AFTER TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AS PART OF THE NOTIFICATION- AND THAT IS BRING ME TO THE END OF MY TALKING POINTS BUT I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATORS- BE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY I JUST- JUST TO CLARIFY THIS IS A CHANGE THAT WERE ASKING OR- IS BEING PASSED. A PERMANENT CHANGE RIGHT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST THIS ONE ONE TIME FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET YEAH WE WERE TO TAKE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENT SO WE WOULDN'T AND CONTROLLED SECTION TO BE AND THAT THANKED BUDGET AT YOUR BUDGET. OKAY I'M WILL THAT SORT OF HELPS- ANSWER THE- ISSUE FOR ME WHICH IS I THINK WELL AS RIGHT NOW THE CARD FOR PROJECT THAT. WOULD BE COVERED YOU IDENTIFIED ONLY ONE I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE ON GOING IF THIS IS GOING TO BE A PERMANENT CHANGE IN HOW- OF- IS LANGUAGE IS USED. THEN I DO THINK THAT- THE L. A. O.'S. ISSUES OF TIMING AND WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS- YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FIND A WHAT A TECHNICAL I GUESS TECHNICAL IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMONLY USED- BUT- WHAT'S NON CONTROVERSIAL. THAT SEEMS TO BE LANGUAGE JUST A LITTLE BIT LOOSER SO I DO AGREE WITH THAT ALLEY- THAT WE NEED TO TIE IN THIS A BIT SO THAT. WE DON'T LOSE OUR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. OF- C. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT'S IT FOR ME. OF NOTHING ELSE THEN WE MOVE ON TO- ALL RIGHT- THREE ISSUE THREE WHICH IS COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS- I'LL ASK OF. C. FROM THE ALLELES OFFICE WHO WILL BE PRESENTING. NEIL AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED BY. CONCENTRICALLY THE PROPOSAL WOULD EXPAND COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE ELIGIBLE INCARCERATED PERSONS WITH A COMMUNITY BASED RESIDENTIAL SETTING TO SERVE THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THEIR SENTENCE. AND PREPARE THEM FOR RE ENTRY. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE A RANGE OF COMMUNITY BASED REHABILITATIVE SERVICES THAT ASSIST WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER MENTAL HEALTH CARE MEDICAL CARE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION AND HOUSING FAMILY REUNIFICATION AND SOCIAL SUPPORT. CDCR CURRENTLY OPERATES TWO OF THESE PROGRAMS- AND THEIR CULTURE MAIL REUNION MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM OR AND SEE OUR PEACE AND THE CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAM. MORRISSEY CTRP IT WAS R. FOUR FIVE MEN AND WOMEN RESPECTIVELY. CURRENTLY THESE PROGRAMS SERVE THIRTEEN COUNTIES AND HAVE A CAPACITY OF AROUND A THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS. M. AND THE INTENT THE ATTENTION AS WE UNDERSTAND IS TO- ULTIMATELY ENABLE CDCR TO BUILD OUTS MORE FACILITIES TO SERVE ADDITIONAL COUNTIES- AS WELL AS HAVE A LARGER PORTION OF THE ROUGHLY THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE RELEASED FROM CDC ARE. GO THROUGH ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS. YOUR AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER O'NEILL NEXT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM CDC ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEVIN COFFEY AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION- I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM OF THE CABLE AND PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION.

A LOCATION IN SAN DIEGO WE CURRENTLY HAVE A CAPACITY OF SIX HUNDRED SIXTY TWO AND WE ARE CURRENTLY AT NINETY FOUR POINT SIX PERCENT. OF BILLS. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HOFFMAN WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM DOUG BOND FROM THE AMITY. FOUNDATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS- OF THE BOND PRESIDENT CEO AMITY FOUNDATION HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE STRANDED REENTRY PROGRAMS MANY FOUNDATIONS BEEN DEDICATED TO THAT INCLUSION FILTRATION OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED BY ADDICTION TRAUMA CRIMINALITY OR SERRATION OF POVERTY- AND HAS WORKED IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS WITH CDC ARE INSIDE OF INSTITUTIONS AND HELPING MEN WHEN THEY COME HOME I CO STRIVE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR THOSE THAT WE'RE SERVING- WE TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE I'VE REPRESENT THAT AS WELL IT WAS A SMALL CHILD DIFFERENT THROUGH OVER A DOZEN FOSTER HOMES- WELL MY FATHER IS INCARCERATED BY MOTHERS MCCARTY STREET IT- SPENT TIME IN ORPHANAGES THE FOUNDERS. OF OUR ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY GOT ME OUT OF FOSTER CARE- MY FATHER WAS ALTERNATIVELY SENSE DANTE WHERE I WAS ABLE TO SPEND TWO YEARS THERE WITH HIM WITH MY SISTER AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES HE NEEDED. TO RETURN BACK TO PRISON- JUST TIME LATER- I WAS ALSO IN MY EARLY TWENTIES SUPPORTERS AND THEN STREET WITH THE- WENT THROUGH OUR- WHILE. AND OVER THE LAST TWENTY HAVE BEEN TO RISE THROUGH THE YOUR- WORKING VARIOUS- I'VE SEEN THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE OR THE COMMUNITY RANCHER PROGRAMS WORK FOR MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE COMING HOME STRONG BELIEVER. AND PATHWAYS BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING SERVED BUT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WELL- THE RE ENTERPRISE JOKES ALLOW PARTISAN SERVE THE FINAL TWO YEARS AS YOU HEARD THEY'RE ABLE TO GET HEALTH CARE. SERVICES EMPLOYMENT SERVICES TREATMENT SERVICES A REALLY WIDE RANGE AND VARIETY OF SERVICES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON. RELEASE EMSTER BASED WORK. AND THIS IS A COLLECTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PROJECT THAT WORKS WITH THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. WHEN YOU REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WORKS THESE PROGRAMS ARE WHAT WORKS AND IT REALLY IS THE FUTURE OF WHAT RE ENTRY SHOULD LOOK LIKE FOR EVERYONE COMING HOME- IT SHOULD BE GAINING ACCESS TO. COMPREHENSIVE REENTRY SERVICES I'VE SEEN A 180 DEGREES CHANGES AND I'M IN AND WOMEN THAT ARE GOING TO PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN'S PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING MENTIONED HERE TODAY. RESEARCH ON THIS IS WELL SUPPORTS IT. WE SHOULD SHOWN RECENTLY WITH STANFORD STUDY THAT WE'VE REDUCED THE ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE FROM 12% TO ONE PERCENT. WHICH IS A 92% REDUCTION. AND RECIDIVISM RATES AND SO WE'RE SHOWING VERY SUCCESSFUL US SUCCESS IN THESE PROGRAMS WE BELIEVE WITH THESE PROGRAMS COUPLED WITH HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES IT REALLY IS A- WAY. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE FROM DEGRADATION DIGNITY AND I WILL JUST AND ON THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE CREATE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE RETURNING HOME IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE IT WOULD BE FOR NFL TATIAN- PROCESS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BE IN A SAFE. SANCTUARY ENVIRONMENT AND THE SAN VITAMINS ARE THAT RATHER THAN. SERVING IN- YOUR SENSE IN GETTING SERVICES AND A PRESENT IT'S REALLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE IN A SAFE PLACE AND SAFELY COME HOME REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME ON THIS AND FOR THE CONSIDERATION THERE'S NO ONE SILVER BULLET THAT WILL DO EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE COMING HOME. AND IT REALLY IS A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT AND BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE THE PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE RETURNING BACK. TO THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU GREAT. THANK YOU MISTER BOND AND THE CONGRADULATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR LIFE STORY- WITH S. R. I WANT TO MOVE ON NOW TO MISTER. THOMAS KNOWS. KNOWS THIS. NOW WHICH TRIGGERED NOT AS OF. THAT WAS AND I KNOW HE MEANT SAVE AGAIN IN OTHER WORDS NOT AS A WITH OKAY THANK YOU WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT SHARE IN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH I FOR ME HERE THIS AFTER THAT TOM KNOWS WHICH THE LEGAL TO FOR THE COMMITTEE HONORED OF THE P. CODE RECENTLY RECOMMENDED EXPANDING THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY SO JUST OF A BRIEF WORD ON WHAT THE PENAL CODE COMMITTEE IS IT WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND- IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE MANDATE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO SIMPLIFY AND RATIONALISE CRIMINAL LAW IN CALIFORNIA. THE COMMITTEE'S GOALS ARE TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY WHILE REDUCING UNNECESSARY INCARCERATION AND IMPROVING JUSTICE MEDICALLY CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM WE'VE PUT OUT TOO MANY RECORDS SO FAR IN OUR MOST RECENT ONE WE RECOMMENDED EXPANDING THE MCRPC CTRP PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON- AS YOU HEARD THESE ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS AT CDC ARE RUNS THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO SPEND THE LAST MONTHS OF THEIR INCARCERATION IN. A SECURED SETTING IN THE COMMUNITY. THE REASON MANY WAS. TO THIS I WAS BIG THE RE THAT- MISTER- SPOKE ABOUT A LITTLE BIT I WON A- THE- A BIT- THERE IS RESEARCH FROM THE STANFORD PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAM THAT- WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT CAUSATION WAS ABLE TO. IDENTIFY A CONTROL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO. COULD HAVE GONE INTO AN M. C. R. P. PROGRAM BUT DIDN'T FOR REASONS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL AND THOSE WHO DID COMPLETE THE PROGRAM SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ISOLATE AND SAY. THE M. C. R. P. HAVE THE HAVE AN EFFECT ON REDUCING RECIDIVISM THEY CONCLUDED THAT THAT YES IT DID. AND YOU KNOW THE STUDY LOOKED AT MOE THAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO WERE RELEASED BETWEEN SEPTEMBER. TWENTY SIXTEEN IN JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN SO IT'S RECENT THAT EXTREMELY RELEVANT TO THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY. WHAT THE RESEARCHERS FOUND WAS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLETED. NINE MONTHS AND M. C. R. P. HAD THAT RECONNECTION RIGHT THAT MR BOND MENTIONS THAT SO. THAT'S A BIG REDUCTION. THEY ALSO FOUND SIMILAR REDUCTIONS IN THE RE ARREST RATES SO THE FIRST PACIFISTIC WITH PEOPLE. CONVICTED OF NEW OFFENSES AND THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE REARRESTED. AND THEY FOUND A 20% REDUCTION IN THE REARREST RATE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE DONE AT LEAST SEVEN MONTHS AND MCRPC- SO. THESE ARE AS I SAID THESE RESULTS ARE VERY STRIKING AND- ARE YOU KNOW IT'S RARE TO FIND A STUDY OF AN EXACT PROGRAM THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO EXPAND SELECT COMMITTEE- WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED BY THE ASSEMBLY. RENDITION OF THIS OVER A FEW OTHER THINGS THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED- THE RECONNECTION RATE FOR WOMEN WHO GO THROUGH THE C. C. T. R. P. PROGRAM AND- YOU KNOW THE ACRONYMS ARE. FAST AND HEAVY IN THIS WORLD AS WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PROGRAM THAT. SERVES WOMEN IN PARTICULAR. THEY HAD A MUCH LOWER REARREST RATE THAN THE OVERALL REARREST RATES ALMOST. CONTROL GROUP STUDY LIKE THE STANFORD STUDY BUT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FINDINGS AND SUPPORTS THE PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACTS HERE. AND FINALLY THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS LIKES TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING- AND TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT BE THINGS THAT CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO THE CALIFORNIA CONTACTS. INDEED THERE IS A HELPFUL MODEL HERE THAT'S THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS. WHICH NOW HAS MORE PEOPLE IN ITS PRISONS SOMETHING WE DO. ALMOST EVERYONE RELEASED FROM FEDERAL PRISON IS GONNA SPEND UP TO THE LAST YEAR MAKES SENSE- SIMILAR PROGRAM- SO AS YOU AS YOU HEARD YOU KNOW WE'RE RELEASING THIRTY THOUSAND. PEOPLE A YEAR FROM PRISON THAT'S ABOUT EIGHTY PEOPLE A DAY MORE THAN EIGHTY PEOPLE A DAY. WE HAVE LESS THAN A THOUSAND OF THESE BEDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE- AND SO BASED ON THAT DATA RESEARCH THE PENAL CODE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED. THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND OTHER POSITIVE BENEFITS BY EXPANDS PROGRAMS. THANK YOU AGAIN AT ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY. MUCH OF. MEMBERS OF. THE COMMENTER YOU HAVE TO A QUESTION OF MA'AM SURE THANK YOU ON A I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT- THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED THERE- IT WAS REFERENCE TO ABOUT A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR COST. A BEFORE TWO HUNDRED BED FACILITY WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GOOD DEAL- FOR INDIVIDUALIZED SPACE BUT I'M I'M WONDERING. HELLO I'M JUST ONE CURIOUS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE LOOK AT. SO MUCH IN TERMS A SHELTER IN IN OTHER IN IN OTHER AREAS WITH THE- HOUSE AND EVERYTHING ELSE- AS TO WHETHER OR TO WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES IS HERE IS IT. IS IT- CONGREGATE SPACE WITH WITH BUNKS FOR. YOU KNOW X. AMOUNT OF PEOPLE- THE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE I GUESS FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR FOR THE IN DORM STYLE OUR INDIVIDUALIZED STYLE OR WHAT'S CONTEMPLATED THEIR- SO I COULD SPEAK TO THAT. SO IT IS SHARED HOUSING- IDEALLY YOU WANT PEOPLE TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY TYPE SETTING- THOSE ARE A DECK TO BE CLEANED UP THE PREVIOUS PROJECTS SO MULTI FAMILY HOUSING- DEPENDING ON THE LAY OUT OF THE ROOM YOU WILL HAVE- UNDER G. TWO OR THREE INDIVIDUALS LIVE AND THEN- SHARED HOUSING AND SO YOU DO. YOU ARE ABLE TO SERVE MORE PEOPLE THERE BUT YOU'RE ALSO REALLY ABLE TO GET THE THERAPEUTIC AND COMMUNITY APPROACH WHICH IS REALLY HELPFUL WALL. OR GOING THROUGH A RE ENTRY PROCESS. OKAY THEN ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION IN TERMS OF COSTS THE FIFTEEN MILLION I WILL ALSO ADD IS- IT DEPENDS ON THE REGION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE AND TWO HUNDRED BEDS IS KIND OF A MAXIMUM NUMBER. MINIMUM WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS FIFTY BEDS THE SIXTY BED FACILITIES AS WELL IT'S EASY FOR ME. TO VISUALIZE- BUT BUT I'VE ONLY SEEN THOSE KIND OF FACILITIES- IN ONLY FOR THE ON HOUSING THE EAST COAST% WHERE THEY- USE- HOMELESS SHELTERS LIKE THAT ESPECIALLY FOR FOLKS WHO. HAVE EXPERIENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS- THE END. ME TYPICALLY WILL MATCH THEM UP TO TWO THREE TO A ROOM AND THEN TRANSITION TRYING TO TRANSITION THEM OUT NINETY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS TO. PERMISSIBLE OF HOUSING TYPICALLY- I JUST WANT TO SAY IN OUR OWN COUNTY- WERE NOT WHAT COUNTIES LISTED FOR THIS PROGRAM SANTA CLARA COUNTY. OF THE REENTRY CENTER THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS OVERALL. BUT ONE OF THE- SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IS- LACK OF HOUSING OR THE EXPIRATION HOUSING VOUCHERS FOR- A FORT FOR THOSE- CLIENTS IF YOU WILL OF THE REENTRY CENTER WHO ARE OTHERWISE STUDENT GREAT- BUT BUSINESS SUDDENLY CANACCORD HOUSING IN A VERY HIGH COST OF LIVING AREA SO ANYWAY I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WE ARE EXPANDING- CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE HOPING TO IMPLEMENT OUR ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM WHICH IS AN OPEN BY JULY ONE. AND THE HOPE IS TO HAVE THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES BE PART OF THE PROGRAM SO I'M NOT SURE SANTA CLARA COUNTY COULD BE PART OF THAT BUT WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT. WELL WASN'T FISHING FOR THAT BUT I'LL TAKE IT- YOU KNOW THAT ALSO DEFINITELY DO ANY I CAN- TO GET THE COUNTY TO BE A GOOD PARTNER IN THAT IF- IF THAT ENDS UP BEING THE CASE. THANK YOU. GREAT ANSWER. SENATOR NEWMAN THAT NOW I HAVE TO START MY GREATER THAN ORANGE COUNTY HAS LIVED IN ORANGE COUNTY SO- ANY GOOD NEWS ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY BUT- EDDIE- THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A VERY PROMISING PROGRAM- TO MISTER BONDS. POINT IMMEDIATE- IF IT'S A DEADLY A COUPLE QUESTIONS. THE WATER I MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT BUT ON A PER CAPITA BASIS HOW DOES. YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM COST ON A PER CAPITA BASIS COMPARED TO INCARCERATION FOR. YOU NOTED THAT THIS POINT AND I GUESS AS I ASKED THAT- IF WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IT WHAT WHAT ARE. YOU THE SORT OF YOU KNOW SOME BALLPARK COST AS WE LOOK FORWARD AS IT COMMITTEE- TO POSSIBLY ALLOCATING FUNDS TO DO THAT WHAT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR TO GET TO SOMETHING REALISTIC THAT STRESS TO- REPLICATE EXPAND THIS VERY PROMISING MODEL. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I CAN. TRY TO ANSWER THAT SO THE PER CAPITA COST FOR US TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE JUST ALL A COSTS TYPICALLY. RANGES FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY TO A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DAY THE PER CAPITA COSTS ON A FOUR CAR STREET XIN I BELIEVE IS AROUND TWO HUNDRED NINETY- DAYS SO. EITHER CERTAINLY COST SAVINGS THERE BUT YOU ALSO GET COST SAVINGS ON THE COST REDUCTION FROM RE CONVICTION WHICH IS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR RECONNECTION. THE DENSER THAT'S OCCURRING SO TO THE EXTENT. IT I THINK I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR YOUR- DESCRIPTION THESE ARE DEAF TO REASON OTHERWISE YOU'RE YOU'RE PURCHASING FACILITIES IN COMMUNITIES SO I ASSUME THAT'S A SEPARATE COST MISTER BOND- ON ON TOP OF. THE YOU KNOW THE DAILY PER CAPITA EXPENSE. SO THOSE ARE ACTUALLY THE ALL IN COST PAYS FOR THE COST OF THE FACILITY AS WELL SO IF WE COULD WORK WITH LANCE B. OR OTHER- PROPERTY OWNERS SIDE OF LEASE OR PURCHASE PROPERTY THAT THE PRICE THAT I MENTION FOR OUR SERVICES ACTUALLY INCLUDES THE COST OF EITHER LEAVES SCENE. OR IT TYPICALLY LEASING OR PURCHASING A PROPERTY. BUT SEARCHING CHAU IS AND THEN IN TERMS OF. PROSPECTIVE CAPACITY BUILDING WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS ON HOW FAST. WE COULD EXPAND THIS PROGRAM TO GET TO SOMETHING. LIKE THE NUMBER THAT I THINK I THINK MR OFTEN DESCRIBE A THIRTY THOUSAND- IN MY TWO YEAR YOU KNOW SO HOPEFULLY MOVING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. I WOULD SAY OUR ABILITY TO REALLY IDENTIFY- RAMP UP PURCHASED OR LEASED NEW SITES AND THEN TRAINED WORK FORCE AND SO I WOULD BELIEVE THAT. WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED AS A REALISTIC- RAMP TO THAT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WANT TO ADD TOM ANYTHING TO THAT IN TERMS OF TIME LINES BUT WE BELIEVE THAT. WE'RE ABLE TO RAMP UP. THERE BEFORE ME PROVIDERS THAT DO THIS SERVICE AND OTHERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THIS WELL TO DO IT. I'M NOT SURE KEVIN THEIR ONLINE SEVENTY. YOU KNOW I THINK THE ONLY THING I WOULD I WOULD ADD IS- YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WE WERE ABLE TO DOUBLE OUR PRISON CAPACITY IN ABOUT TEN YEARS SO I THINK WE'VE SHOWN THAT WE CAN MAKE THE KIND OF INVESTMENT IN THE SYRIAN HOPEFULLY IN A- IN A WAY THAT- IS LITTLE MORE CITIES A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE OF THE PENAL CODE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED IN MAKING THIS RECOMMENDATION. GO AHEAD SIR I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE- THINGS WE FIND THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT IT'S CITING. PROGRAMS- INDIA'S AND OF COURSE- THAT CAN BE AN ISSUE BUT- SO FAR WE'VE BEEN PRETTY LUCKY WITH THE SCIENCE THAT WE HAVE AND I'VE JUST HEARD IN TERMS OF A NUMBER LOOKING OUT YOU KNOW ONE TO THREE YEARS WHAT SHOULD WHAT SHOULD WE BE. ANTICIPATING BY WAY OF A OF YOU KNOW THAT ASK FOR THIS. AND IF AND IF OF IF WITH THE O'NEILL WANTS TO JUMP IN AT ANY POINT. PLEASE FEEL FREE. I WOULD YEAH GO AHEAD MISCIBLE PLEASE. I WAS JUST GOING TO OFFER A TWENTY- ARSENIC VISUAL INFORMATION ON THE PER CAPITA COST AND YOUR QUESTION SENATOR NEWMAN- WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE DAILY COST TO HAVE THE AVERAGE COST TO HOUSE A PERSON IN A STATE OPERATED PRISON- COMES OUT TO AROUND. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS A DAY AT THE CURRENT AVERAGE COST OF AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND- DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE POPULATION BEING PARTICULARLY LOW DUE TO KOBE- I JUST. WANTED TO KNOW THAT- DEAD COST OF THE STATE ACTUALLY SAVES ONE IT. NO LONGER HOUSES A PERSON IN A STATE OPERATED PRISON. IS CLOSER TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY OR THIRTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR- THAT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T. THE STATE DOESN'T GET THE FIXED COST SAVING ESSENTIALLY DOES. SALARIES BEING THE BIG TICKET ITEMS- INTEL IT ACTUALLY CLOSES A PRISON SO. TO SEE THAT- DOES FULL SAVINGS ON THE INCARCERATIONS CIDER THE STATE OPERATED FACILITY PRISON FACILITY SIDE. WE WOULD NEED TO- BE ACTIVATING AND OFF OF THESE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE A PRISON- OR SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF A PRISON TO THIS EXTENT WE COULD. WRITTEN DOWN THOSE FIXED COSTS AND- AVERAGE PRISON. IN THE RANGE OF A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE I HOPE THAT HELPS SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING THAT ACTUALLY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL SO YOU TO DRIVE THE POINT WELL TAKEN THANK YOU. BUT ARE WE STILL ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A NUMBER EVEN IF IT'S JUST AND- YOU KNOW VERY BALLPARK ASPEN. AT DO THAT WE SHOULD BE THINK ABOUT IT IRRESPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW THROUGH THE INTERSECTION OF THOSE. UNITS OF THE- PER CAPITA YOUR INMATE VERSUS- REENTRY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHOULD WE I GUESS MR BOND INVESTORS LIKE YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A NUMBER THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT AS FRESH AS WE LOOK AT. NOT JUST THIS BUDGET BUT FUTURE BUDGETS- WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK BY WHERE WE DON'T SOMETHING REALISTIC. YEAH I THINK SOMETHING REALISTIC OVER THE NEXT- YOU MENTIONED ONE TO THREE YEARS FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND BETS A YEAR. AS THOSE NUMBERS INCREASE IN ANSWER REDUCE SOME OF THE VARIOUS KEVIN MENTIONED ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIERS TO THAT WHICH IS LAND USE- IN INDIA SOME SO AS THOSE BARRIERS ARE REDUCED- THE CAPACITY AND ABILITY TO INCREASE THOSE. WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AS WELL. I'M STILL WAITING FOR A NUMBER. I'VE HEARD TO BUT YOU THAT'S SO WANT MY- THIRTY OR DID YOU GIVE IT TO ME I MISSED IT. I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT SENATOR I PROJECT. THE BIG DEAD BUT I THINK WOULD BE HEALTH. IT'S GREAT AND I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS MAY BE TO MISTER HOFFMAN HOW- HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO GETS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE- IN THE CURRENT PROGRAMS- GIVEN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LIMITED. CAPACITY OF- IS THERE AND WAIT LIST YOU KNOW. HOW DO PEOPLE BECOME. ELIGIBLE FOR IT. I'M SURE THE PROGRAM IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THE PROGRAM FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. IT IS REVIEWED- OF THEIR CRIMINAL HISTORY AND THERE THERE ARE CHARGES ARE REVIEWED ON VARIOUS CRITERIA- THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM- BUT IT'S A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. AND PRIOR TO CODE WE WERE- YOU KNOW BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR WORK WERE VERY HIGH AND NUMBERS IN THE NINETIES CONSTANTLY- AND WE'RE GETTING BACK TO THAT RIGHT NOW- SO WE HAVE A CONSTANT LIST OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE INSTITUTIONS. THAT ARE INTERESTED IT'S NOT OVERWHELMING SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY- MAYBE WE HAVE SOME WAITING LIST IN LA RIGHT NOW BECAUSE ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE ABOUT FIELD. JEWEL'S YOU KNOW THEY CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT THE PROBE BASED ON THEIR REAL STATES. THERE WILL BE NO I HAVE. BEEN STEP BACK. BUT IT IS A VOTE. PROGRAM AND THERE IS A CRITERIA THAT- ALLOWS THEM TO COME TO THE PROGRAM. AND IS THERE A WAIT LIST. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY A WAIT LIST WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS I WE HAVE A WHAT WE CALL SHAREPOINT. AND THE END OF THE POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE- PARTICIPANTS ARE IN A SHAREPOINT AND WE'RE GOING TO THOSE ALL THE TIME BUT AT THIS TIME WERE WERE ACCOMMODATING INDIVIDUALS GETTING OUT THERE- ARE THERE COULD BE ONE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THAT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE CODE RESTRICTIONS ANYMORE- SO AS OF RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A WAIT LIST BUT THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THE LOS ANGELES AREA THEY MIGHT NOT BE THE TIME FRAME THAT EITHER THEY'RE IN THE SHAREPOINT BUT THERE'S- YOU KNOW WE CAN GET HIM OUT THERE UP TO TWO YEARS PRIOR TO THE RELEASE. AND SO WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY CAN. YOU KNOW THEY'RE OUT THAT TO YOUR POINT SO WE CAN GET HIM OUT THERE- SO THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A WEIGHTLESS RENDON HEARING OF MR HOFFMAN AND OTHERS WE- I THINK THERE'S A REAL. POSITIVE YOU KNOW SUPPORT. OF FOR THIS THIS PROGRAM AND TO THE DEGREE THAT. YOU KNOW THE FUNDING WE CAN HELP THEM GET THE FUNDING THERE TO THE DEGREE THAT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO THIS CAN BUILD THEIR CAPACITY YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MOVE MORE- I THINK REALLY- WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION SO- HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT AND NOT CREATE NOT HAVE A WAIT LIST. BUT HAVE A CONTINUOUSLY GROWING- SO THAT WE COULD GET MORE INDIVIDUALS THROUGH A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. THOUGH THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF I THINK THAT'S IT FOR THIS HERE. THANKS THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO WHO TESTIFIED APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HARD WORK. OKAY WE'RE MOVING ON TO ISSUE FOR WHICH IS REAL TIME MEASUREMENT OF PAROLED PROGRAMMING AND OUTCOMES. SO WITH FAST. THREE IF YOU FOR OKAY FIRST WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OF THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE. RESENT WHO IS THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SANDERS NEEDS ORLANDO SANCHEZ WITH THE L. A. L. HI COMMITTEE STAFFERS ASKED WAS TO PRESENT THIS ITEM THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF CDCR STAYED ON REENTRY PROGRAMMING AND OUTCOMES. ALSO WOULD ENABLE CDCR OVER WITH RECIDIVIST IN NONPROFIT THAT SPECIALIZES IN ANALYZING CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA. TO DEVELOP A DATA COLLECTION AND VISUALIZATION TOOL TO ANALYZE REENTRY OUTCOMES IN THE CONTEXT. OF COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS HEAVY AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYMENT AND TREATMENT. AND CUSTOMER TO THE PANELISTS CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU ORLANDO THAT WAS THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND- GOOD AFTERNOON- CENTERS DRAWS- CORTESE AND NEWMAN- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE. MY NAME IS SUMMER DEAR AND I'M HONORED TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE PEARL OUT COMES IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS OUR STATE HAS SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED. IS INCARCERATED POPULATION FROM A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THE CLOSER TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND THIS IS A SIGNAL OF AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO DIVERTING RESOURCES AWAY FROM CAPACITY ATION. AND REINVESTING THEM IN REINFORCING STRONG DRIVING COMMUNITIES. NO PAROLE IS A CORE PART OF THAT STRATEGY. TODAY CALIFORNIA INVESTS OVER NINE HER MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN RURAL SERVICES. AS YOU HEARD FROM ORLANDO THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE HOUSING SERVICES EMPLOYMENT SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENTS- AND SO ON- ALL THESE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RE ENTERING OUR COMMUNITIES- AND DESPITE THIS WE DON'T HAVE RELIABLE REAL TIME DATA AND MEASUREMENTS. TO TELL US HOW EFFECTIVE ARE VESTED INVESTMENTS ARE- AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL ENABLE. SO AS YOU HEARD I WORK AT RECIDIVISTS- A NONPROFIT THAT BUILDS TECHNOLOGY TOOLS WITHIN CORRECTIONS. WE CURRENTLY WORK IN NINE STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND WE CAN ENABLE DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S FOR ALL PROCESSES- OUR TOOLS WILL ASSESS REENTRY SERVICES INVESTMENTS. ENABLING CALIFORNIA TO DO MORE OF WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S OF WHAT'S NOT. SO WE CAN HELP YOU GET ANSWERS TO KEY QUESTIONS LIKE IS A PARTICULAR PROGRAM INCREASING STABLE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE RETURNING FROM PRISON- WHAT SHARE OF INDIVIDUALS ON PAROLE WHO COMPLETES A MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAM SECURES THE JOB. AND HOW DO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS COMPARE ACROSS DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS THINGS LIKE RACE SEX AND AGE- AND OF COURSE GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS. THE REAL TIME MEASUREMENT ABRIL PROGRAMMING OUTCOMES CAN UNIQUELY IN POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE TO OVERSEE AND IMPROVE REENTRY ACROSS THE STATE- AND THAT'S WHERE ROSEN TO DO HERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION TO BRING IT BACK TO A QUESTIONS FROM OUR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO NO- I JUST HAVE A- IF YOU COULD MISTER DEAR- PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF ANALYSIS YOU HAVE DONE FOR OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY LED TO A POLICY CHANGE THREE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT AND TOOLS THAT WE BILLS- SO BRIEFLY THOSE ARE MINE STAFF TOOLS LEADERSHIP TOOLS AND PUBLIC TOOLS- SO THE PUBLIC TOOLS I WELCOME YOU TO COME TAKE A LOOK AT. OUR WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE DASHBOARDS FOR PENNSYLVANIA AND NORTH DAKOTA WHERE WE'VE SHOWN- BOTH PAROLE SUPERVISION POPULATIONS OF PROBATION AS WELL AS FACILITY POPULATIONS- AND THAT LED TO- THAT THOSE INSIGHTS THIS REAL TIME MEASUREMENTS LEAD PENNSYLVANIA TO CHANGE ITS POLICY ON GERIATRIC PAROLE. I'M RECOGNIZING THAT IN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE- IN THE FACILITIES WERE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY IN THAT CASE- AND THAT WAS DRIVEN DIRECTLY BY NOT ONLY THE DATA BUT ALSO HAVING IT- TRANSPARENT AND AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC- SAYS OF THE PUBLIC. DASHBOARD SIDE- WE ALSO BUILD- LINE SETTLES TOOLS FOR. EARLY IN TO BETTER UNDER WHAT'S- WITH THE PEOPLE THAT BASED. AND WE WILL USE THAT IN MANY STATES INCLUDING IDAHO NORTH DAKOTA ETCETERA THERE'S A GREAT VIDEO ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED- ON YOU TOO BUT JUST ONE OF A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW IN IDAHO WE WERE ABLE TO- ROUTE- EITHER- RELEASED FROM SUPERVISION ALTOGETHER OR REDUCE THE SUPERVISION LEVEL. OF 5% OF THE PEOPLE ON PAROLE JUST BE JUST JUST BY- MANAGING THE DATA AS IN THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE ALREADY BUT IDAHO'S DATA SYSTEMS- WEREN'T EQUIPPED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AND SO WE AS RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN- AND THEN THURSDAY IS LEADERSHIP TOOLS AND THAT'S YOU CENTER ON ONGOING BASIS FOR- IN MOST CASES THEY DO YOU SEE LEADERSHIP TO SEE. IN REAL TIME HOW THE REFORMS AND IN MANY CASES CHANGES THEY'RE MAKING- AFFECTS THEIR POPULATIONS- NOT ON A- ANNUAL OR QUARTERLY. BUT ACTUALLY ON A WEEKLY BASIS IN REAL TIME. OKAY AND COULD HOW LONG YOU BEEN TO THIS WHAT WHAT IS THE- WHEN DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS IDEA- SO WE'VE BEEN AROUND AS AN ORGANIZATION FOR A LITTLE BIT OVER THREE YEARS. WE STARTED AS A WHAT'S CALLED A 20% PROJECT IN GOOGLE- SO OUR FOUNDERS ARE. FORMER GOOGLE- AND TECHNOLOGISTS AND- AND THEN EMERGE OUT OF GOOGLE I OR THE ORIGINS BECOME KIND OF BEFORE THOSE THREE OUT HERE THIRTY THREE SHARES- BUT WE'VE BEEN A NONPROFIT FOR ABOUT THAT MUCH TIME. YOU KNOW- WHEN I WAS READING ABOUT THIS IT. KIND OF REMINDED ME I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS CORRECT- TO MAKE THIS CONNECTION BUT WHAT WAS THAT OF BASEBALL MONEYBALL. IT IS THIS IS THIS KIND OF LIKE ALONG THOSE LINES OR OR MY TOTALLY OFF. AS IT'S A GOOD PARALLEL ACTUALLY SO IT IN BUSINESS ELEMENTS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING THAT GOES IN INTO THIS AND THEN THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF DATA SCIENCE. AND CERTAINLY ON THE DESIGN SIDE IT CAN FEEL LIKE MONEYBALL IN THAT- WE CAN JUST BETTER UNDERSTANDS. WHAT THE DATA MEANS WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN- IN REAL TIME BUT ALSO PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE AND SOME MONEYWHILE YOU'RE SAYING. ESSENTIALLY DATA PROJECTION WHICH WE ALSO DO. NOT OKAY. OKAY I. CAN I CAN INCREASE OF COURSE THANK YOU I- FIRST OF ALL THE JUDGES ONE OF THE CHAIRS MY LEAF ENDED. THE GERIATRIC APPLIES TO PEOPLE OVER. AND ALSO AGAIN YOU I'M NOT SIX RIGHT I'M COOL WITH IT- BUT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE UNIT YOU KNOW TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT MODEL RIGHT SO DID IN MY EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS STATE GOVERNMENT. WE'RE NOT AS GOOD WITH DATA AS- I THINK WE'D LIKE TO BE WHEN I WAS GOOD WITH TECHNOLOGY ON BOARDING AS WE LIKE TO BE. SO YOU KNOW IT WENT RECIDIVISTS IS ENGAGE WHAT WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP. HOW TO HOW DOES IT WORK SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME INFO SURE INSTEAD- PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING AT AND TRIPPING THE DATA WELL. THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- TO. YEAH THERE THERE THERE'S TO ENGAGE IN MODELS- BUT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT HERE. WHAT IS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE D. O. C. THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN THIS CASE CDCR- IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- THE FOUNDER LINE DATA THAT FLOOD AS IF THAT. IS NECESSARY FOR US TO DO REALLY MEANINGFUL WORK- IS DATA THE CDC ARE- HAS A HISTORICAL DATA- SO BUT- I'M GLAD TO SAY WE HAVE A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WITH CDCR WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ON A NUMBER OF OTHER FRONTS- THAT. THAT LINE STAFF TOOLS- TOOL THAT I MENTIONED FOR PAROLE OFFICERS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TALKING CDCR ABOUT- ROLLING OUT. SELLING BEST IN TERMS OF GETTING THE BEST THAT'S THE FIRST THE STRIDES IT'S MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT DATA. THAT WE'RE- SPEAKING WITH AND CONNECTING WITH THEIR- RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY TEAMS. ALL OF WHICH IN CALIFORNIA ARE ARE LINING UP- AND THEN YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THAT ON THE- LEGISLATURE SIDE. IT'S IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO HAVE THE DATE OUT THERE BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE- AND I AND AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE- I THINK. MY FAVORITE THING TO SHOW FOLKS AND IF YOU IF YOU WANT EVEN SCREEN SHARE- BUT BUT EVERYTHING IS TO YOU THE DASHBOARDS FOR. AGAIN PENNSYLVANIA NORTH DAKOTA JUST. GOOGLE RECIDIVISM. D. I. D. I. Z. AT THE END- AND PENNSYLVANIA YOU'LL SEE IT'S- AND YOU'LL SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA HOW YOU CAN CHANGE- THE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS THAT YOU WANT TO SEE. IN BEEN VERY SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND VISUALS- AND IN ADDITION IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE IF YOU CLICK ON THE- ON POLICY. YOU'LL SEE THAT WE NOT ONLY JUST SHOW THE DATA IN VISUALISATIONS. WE ALSO- ENCAPSULATE THEM IN ONE PAGE POLICY MEMOS. SO YOU'LL SEE ON THAT LIST- ACTUALLY DID BEGIN TO THE DATA SCIENCE MONEYBALL QUESTION- YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE ONE PAGE MEMOS FOR THE REQUESTED BY. DIFFERENT STATES AND SOMETHING SOME CASES THEY SENATORS ACTUALLY- WHO WANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR EXAMPLE WHAT A POLICY. WILL MEAN IN TERMS OF- THE IMPACT ON POP. AND ON THE STATE'S ABOUT- AND WE- PUT THE- IN ONE- EASY. VISUALS A THAT- MAKE IT EASIER TO GROW. AT ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL- AND SO WHAT WHAT. YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT'S THE BASE THERE IS A WORD WITH. STATE RETAINS YOU- OF ALL ALL INCOME YOUR WORD IT ON A- KIND OF EBAY SINCE OF YOU KNOW WERE WILL. WORK DONE IN KERR'S THIS BECAUSE HER HAS WORK FISHING FOR LIKE LOW AT THE- AGE SAID A OF POCKET. YES IT'S A SET ANNUAL. AND THEN AND THAT'S WHAT'S INCLUDED IN ABOUT- AND FOR THAT YOU GET. ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS- SO THE IT'S A BIT LIKE. MICROSOFT OFFICE IF YOU IF YOU WILL- WHERE- YOU PAY A SET LICENSE FEE AND YOU GET EVERYTHING THAT WE BUILD SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF WE BUILD A DIFFERENT TOOL FOR OREGON OR- OR TENNESSEE FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT THEY HAVE A CERTAIN NEED- CALIFORNIA THEN GETS ACCESS THAT TOO AS WELL- AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE WE- UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE ARE WHILE EVERY STATE IS DIFFERENT THERE ARE PARALLEL NEEDS ACROSS THEM- AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THOSE- GET SHARED- SO THIS IS A SET FEE. FOR THEM OUR TOOLS ARE OUR PRODUCTS- THE SECOND PIECE THAT I MENTIONED ABOUT. THE POLICY MEMOS THOSE ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDE FOR FREE- SO ANYONE CAN GO ON THERE YOU CAN GO ON THERE TODAY AND REQUEST THE MEMO IF YOU'VE GOT SOME POLICY THAT YOU'DLIKE TO SEE MOLD OUT. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THOSE- AT NO COST- PARTLY BECAUSE- IN A- TO. LET'S ASKING FOR THE BILL'S MEMOS WE ALSO GET- THIRD PARTIES LIKE THE ACLU AND ACTUALLY I SHOULD MENTION. ORGANIZATIONS ON ALL- ENDS OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM- ASKING FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM STYLE- POLICY MEMOS THEY CAN GO ON THERE AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT FOR FREE. CHOI THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING SO- I GUESS HOW IT WORKS AS A DATA SCIENTIST WOULD GO LOOK GOOD. YOU KNOW THE DATA WITH AN EYE TOWARD COMING WITH A POLICY RECOMMENDATION SO IT IS. RECIDIVISTS IT'S IF YOU'RE A FOR PROFIT ENTITY RADIORAGE OR YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR NONPROFIT. NONPROFIT WERE PHARMACY THREE OH CANCER OKAY YEAH OKAY NO SOURCES MORE SO. YEAH NOT NOT. OUR IMPORTANTLY NOT. STE TO DO. OF A SMALL. AMENDMENTS SAY WE IT WOULD BE THAT WE'RE GOING TO. A POLICY. IT'S A POLICY THAT YOU'RE WILL TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAVE WHAT IT'LL WHAT IF IT'LL HAVE WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS IN TURN OF- POPULATION PROJECTION TERMS OF COST THE STATE ETCETERA- WE DO NOT GET AN OPINION ON IT WE JUST TELL YOU WHAT- OUR DATA SAYS. WILL HAPPEN- AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S OFFERED FOR FREE- AND IT'S WE WERE ABLE TO FIND THAT IS ACTUALLY THROUGH PHILANTHROPY SO WE RAISE MONEY TO SAY HERE'S THIS NONPARTISAN. DATA SCIENCE TOOL THAT WE UNDERSTAND ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT AFFORD- OR NOT THIS CASE LEGISLATORS. HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR- AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I GET ASSESSED WITH REAL DATA DRIVEN MEASUREMENT. ISSUE THAT THANK YOU MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH VERY- FOR YOUR INFORMATION WE'RE GOING TO ON TO ISSUE FIVE WHICH IS WITH THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS IT'S THE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE FUND STABILIZATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAKE A PRESENTATION PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I JUST NEED A MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. TO TEMPORARILY PAUSE THE SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT FORMULA OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ESTABLISHED THAT COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES FONG- ACTIVE TWO THOUSAND NINE OR THAT SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT PROGRAM- WITH TWO MAJOR PURPOSES ONE WAS TO LEVY STATE PRISON OVERCROWDING IN TWO WAYS TO SAVE GENERAL FUND MONIES. ARE THESE GOALS ARE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT COMPROMISING PUBLIC SAFETY BY ENCOURAGING COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S USE EVIDENCE BASED SUPERVISION PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ON FELONY SUPERVISION SENT TO STATE PRISONS. SB SIX SEVENTY GRANTS ARE INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE THESE PRACTICES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SB SIX ANY ALLOCATED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE COUNTIES THE REQUIRED TO ANNUALLY REPORT TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON HOW TO USE THESE FUNDS. MY APOLOGIES FOR GETTING A LITTLE TECHNICAL HERE BUT SIX SEVEN EIGHT FUNDS ARE BASED ON THREE COMPONENTS ARE THE FIRST IS A COMPARISON OF THE RETURN TO PRISON RATE DETERMINED BY HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ON FELONY SUPERVISION ARE. PRISON OUT OF THE COUNTY FOR ALL MANY SUPERFICIAL POPULATION THE SECOND IS A COMPONENT OF EACH COUNTY'S MOST RECENT RETURN TO PRISON RATE AND A COMPARISON AGAINST THE COUNTY'S RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR HI THIS IS A COMPARISON OF YEAR TO YEAR DATA AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE PAYMENT COUNTIES. IT'S AN FEWER INDIVIDUALS TO PRISON FROM SAUDI SUPERVISION THAN THEY DID IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE THIRD COMPONENT IS TO ESTABLISH A FLOOR IT PROVIDES A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ALL COUNTIES THAT REPORTED DATA AS REQUIRED BY THE STATUTE. A CODE NINETEEN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE FIRST TWO COMPONENTS I TO GIVE A DETAILED COMPARISON AND PERSPECTIVE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATEWIDE- REVOCATION RATE WAS ABOUT THREE POINT 6% AND THERE ARE AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND FELONY PROBATION REVOCATIONS WHO WERE SENT BACK TO PRISON. WHICH WERE. PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TWELVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. HOWEVER DURING THE TWO TWENTY YEAR. AND IN THE MIDST OF THAT BUT- ONLY FRACTION THE KIND OF STANDARD NUMBER OF IN. ON PRO WERE RETURNED PRISON OUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC POLICIES IMPACTS THE COURTS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND HAD THE STATUTORY FORMULA REMAIN THE SAME THIS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED TO COUNTIES FOR THESE PURPOSES- WHICH IS WHY LAST YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH A TEMPORARY PAUSE- AND- AT A FUNDING SCHEDULED TO PROVIDE. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR THE GRANTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- THE AMOUNT WAS DETERMINED FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PAYMENT BY EACH COUNTY HAD RECEIVED OVER THE PRIOR THREE YEARS- AGAIN. THAT WAS JUST A ONE YEAR POLICY THOUGH AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON THE EXISTING FORMULA. OUR DATA SO FAR FROM COUNTY OR TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAS SHOWN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER RIGHT REVOCATIONS COMPARED TO TWENTY TWENTY. AB COVER NINETEEN VERY OUTBREAKS SUCH AS DELTON ON THE CRIME. YOU TO COMPLICATE THE SITUATION AND DIFFERENT COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PRACTICES VERY CONSIDERABLY. OUT WE ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE THESE CHANGES BECAUSE OF COVERAGE- WILL CONTINUE TO REFLECT IN THE NORMAL DATA. FOR SIX SEVENTY EIGHT THROUGH CALENDAR YEARS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I WHICH IS WHY THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PROPOSE THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PODS. IN THE FUNDING THROUGH A FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WE ANTICIPATE KIND OF THAT THE LONG TAIL A LINGERING IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC WILL. FULLY DISSIPATE FROM THE DATA- FINALLY AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THIS PROPOSAL IS TEMPORARY FORMULA NEXT. AFTER THE FACT DEPEND FOR NO. OF IN THE DATA I ENSURE THAT THE- MAINTAINS THIS OF THINGS. COUNTY FOR DEPARTMENT'S IN MAY. CALIFORNIA PRISON POPULATION I WITHOUT A MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER ADELMAN- WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE L. A. O. NOW AND- WHO WILL BE DOING THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND IT'LL BE PER LINE A SENTENCE AGAIN OKAY. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE EXTENDED THE PROPOSED MODIFICATION OF FORMULA ON A ONE YEAR CASES AS OPPOSED TO THREE. THE EXTENT ANY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE THE ADMINISTRATION COULD PROPOSE- FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR BUDGET PROCESS. TWO MAIN REASONS THAT ARE LEADING TO OUR RECOMMENDATION. THAT FIRST IT IS UNCLEAR WHY MODIFYING THE FORMULA FOR THREE YEARS IS NECESSARY. GIVEN THAT THE FULL SET OF INFORMATION IS NOT YET AVAILABLE. RIGHT AND THEN SECOND THE PROPOSED MODIFICATION COULD UNNECESSARILY UNDERMINE THE INTENT OF SB SIX SEVENTY TWO AWARD COUNTIES BASED ON PERFORMANCE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GROUND MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE BUDGET YEAR. BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SUCH SUGGESTIONS AT THAT TIME WHEN IT. AND IT'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO DO SO YOU CAN I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. AS NEEDED. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SENATOR NEWMAN. I GUESS JUST A REAL QUICK QUESTION FOR ELLIE OF. I'M SO WE'RE WE'RE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO OBJECT TO THE FORM OF ID DO WE HAVE DATA ARE THE COMPELLING SHOWS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS DOES IT WORK IS IT A CHEATING ITS DESIRED EFFECT OVER TIME. THIS IS TRUE SO TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO ON IT PRIOR TO THE FORMULA BEING PAS- THEY DIDN'T COLLECT DATA ON THE NUMBER OF. PEOPLE WHO WERE ON COUNTY FELONY SUPERVISION WHO WERE PREVENTED FROM COMING TO THE STATE- AN ESTIMATE OF THAT AMOUNT AND IT DID SUGGEST THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO OF YOUR TO BE PREVENTED FROM COMING TO STATE PRISON AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAM. AND HAS THERE EVER BEEN ANY PROCESS ON A UNITS FOR THE NOTE AND R. O. Y. SORT OF METRIC TO SEE IF THIS IS BE MORE. IMPACTFUL ARE BETTER USE OF FUNDS AND OTHER APPROACHES. SO THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS THE WAY THEIR PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED WAS THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE STATE SAVINGS THAT OCCURS. WHEN ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE PREVENTED FROM COMING FROM. A STATE PRISON SO WHEN THIS WILL THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED THAT AMOUNT WAS TAGGED AT ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- COOL PER- FELONY PROBATION OR DIVERTED FROM STATE PRISON. SINCE THEN AND SO AT THAT POINT- IT WAS- RELATIVELY CLEAR THAT THE STATE WAS ACHIEVING SOME SAVINGS. SINCE THE PROGRAM HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME TO HAVE DIFFERENT POTS. AND ALSO BECAUSE STATE PRISON COSTS HAVE CHANGED FROM WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS FIRST DONE. ON THAT. DAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS CLEAR AS TO HOW THE COST OF THE PROGRAM COMPARES TO THE SAVINGS. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING CERTAINLY WORTH EXPLORING. IF THAT DID NOT DIED THANK YOU- YES N. M. FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MISTER ADELMAN COULD YOU. RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES I KNOW AND IT'S SOMEWHAT MADE REFERENCE IS HERE WE ARE GUARANTEEING OUR FUNDING WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE BASED SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. AGAIN I THINK THE ISSUE AND WHILE WE'RE GONE WE'RE PROPOSING KIND OF THIS TEMPORARY FREEZE IS BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC WHICH COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY PERFORMING KIND OF DIS INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES. TO HAVE FEWER- INDIVIDUALS RETURNED TO PRISON OR IF THERE ARE OTHER KINDS EXTERNAL FACTORS THAT ARE REDUCING THEIR RETURN TO PRISON RIGHT NOW IT'S COUNTIES- YOU KNOW SOME COUNTIES HAD A MAKRAN SHUTDOWNS IN OUR COURT SYSTEM THROUGH- JANUARY- THERE IS A LIMITED INTAKE TO STATE PRISONS THROUGH FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ENDS AND SO WE'RE SEEING KIND OF THIS THIS NOISE IN THE DATA THESE ARE OF WHAT COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY DOING PERFORMANCE WISE AND SO SOME COUNTIES MIGHT HAVE LOWER RETURN TO PRISON RATES BECAUSE OF OTHER FACTORS SOME COUNTIES MAY HAVE HIGHER RETURN TO PRISON RATES BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IN KIND OF PROSECUTING INDIVIDUALS. AND SO IT'S JUST REALLY THE KIND OF STUFF STYLE WHAT IS A PROBATION DEPARTMENT DOING VERSUS YOU. KNOW KIND OF THESE OTHER FACTORS. MMHM OKAY- BUT DOES THAT DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT HAS TO DO WITH BY ASKING FOR A THREE YEAR EXTENSION VERSES ON A ONE YEAR EXTENSION IF WE'RE IF WE'RE UP IN THE AIR ABOUT THE ACTUAL INFORMATION HOW DOES THAT LEAD O THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF ONE YEAR FOR ITS PART THE THREE OR FIVE THE REASON IF WE KIND OF CAME UP WITH THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATE IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY MORE KIND OF DIRECTED IMMEDIATE KOBE RESPONSES A LITTLE BIT OF A HAS LINGERED INTO TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALTHOUGH. THANKFULLY THINGS DO SEEM TO BE OPENING UP ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE WANTED TO. KIND OF TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO DATA WITH IT THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF COURT IMPACTS AS FAR AS BACKLOGS FOR CASES THAT HAVE KIND OF BEEN- DELAYED AND DISPOSITIONS I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC BY COUNTY DATA FOR THIS BUT WE HAVE HEARD KIND OF ANECDOTALLY THAT HAVE. BEEN SENDING REDUCE DISPOSITIONS PARTICULAR ON THEIR FELONY CASELOADS I'M JUST BECAUSE OF KIND OF GENERAL IMPACTS AND A POTENTIAL BACKLOG- IN SO TO THE EXTENT WE THOUGHT THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY TO DATE WOULD CAN TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE KIND OF NOISY OR KIND OF EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND THEN THE REASON FOR THE THIRD YEARS IS LARGELY BASED ON THE KIND OF YEAR TO YEAR COMPARISON AT THE EXISTING FORMULA CONSIDERS. SO WE WANTED TO KIND OF HAVE A SPACE BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONE THING'S KIND OF OUR ARE ANTICIPATED AND HOPEFULLY NORMALIZED IT THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR TO BECAUSE ONCE THINGS DO NORMALIZE IF THERE HAD BEEN LIKE A REDUCING INDIA WILL SENT. BACK TO PRISON FROM THE FELONY SUPERVISION CASELOADS THE BEST SUBSEQUENT YEAR WHEN THINGS DID FINALLY NORMALIZED IF THERE'D BE ANY YOU KNOW ANY ALLOCATED- FIGURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND SO WE KIND OF WANTEDTO BUILD IN A LITTLE BIT OF A APPLICATION TO REFLECT BACK TO. THE FORMULA KIND OF NORMALIZE IT WOULD GET BACK TO THAT YEAR TO YEAR COMPARISON. ASKED INTENDED. AT OKAY. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THE THREE YEARS LITTLE. IS TO CHEN CONSIDERING THE AND- THAT WERE LACKING ON THIS. OF THANK YOU VERY APPRECIATE THAT PRESENTATION WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX. WHICH IS THE ADULT RE ENTRY OUR PROGRAM AND WILL HAVE THE- DSCC- MAKE A PRESENTATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS SIDE DEPUTY DIRECTOR RECORDED THE GREAT SHIP THE BOARD'S THINKING CORRECTIONS. PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OVERVIEW YOU DON'T RICH PROGRAM. WE ARE NOT RICHARD GRANT PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT AND HAS ECEIVED ONGOING FIND IN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DELIVER REENTRY SERVICES FOR PEOPLE FROM INCARCERATED STATE PRISON. SPECIFICALLY FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE- ONE HAND OFTEN REENTRY SERVICES AND REHABILITATION OF EXISTING PROPERTIES AND BUILDINGS. NOW THE ENERGY PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY FUNDING TO COURTS AND A THIRD COURT IS FUNDED DEVELOPMENT. WHAT ONE HAS ALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION BETWEEN SEVENTY PROGRAMS AND A QUICK BREAKDOWN OF THAT IS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIVE MILLION IS GOING TOWARDS SIXTY NINE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROVIDING. RENTAL ASSISTANCE SOME WARM HAND OFF RANGE- SERVICES. FIVE MILLION IS GOING TO ONE PROJECT FOR THE REHABILITATION OF AN EXISTING PROPERTY AND- YOU HEARD FROM A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE ABBEY FOUNDATION AND IN THIS INSTANCE- THEY ARE ONE OF THEY ARE THE AGENCIES RECEIVE BETTER- THAT FILING THE APPLICATION- FOR COURT TO- WE'VE ALLOCATED A POSSIBLY THIRTY FIVE MILLION- BETWEEN FORTY FIVE PROGRAMS- SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TOWARDS EIGHT PROGRAMS PROVIDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE. AND ANOTHER SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE TOWARDS THIRTY SEVEN PROGRAMS PROVIDING WARM HAND. OFF THE SERVICES- IS YOU MY IMAGINE- THESE FINE ARE ARE TO PROVIDE KEY SO. I COMPLY ALL THEM BUT JUST SOME THEM AND PERMITS SPORTED HOUSING RENTAL SUBSIDY SUBSIDIES ARE SHORT TERM EMERGENCY HOUSING- TRANSITIONAL HOUSING HOUSING VOUCHERS- AND JUST SOMEONE AND SO FORTH- I WOULD SURE THAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH ALL CALIFORNIA- FROM PROVIDERS LOCATED AS FAR NORTH AS PLUMAS COUNTY- ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN. AND I'M FINALLY I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE COWORK THREE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL THAT'S- I'LL RIGHT NOW AREN'T SENATE'S CONCLUDE RIGHT NOW FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND WARM HAND OFF REENTRY SERVICES PROJECT- THAT WAS RELEASED BACK ON FEBRUARY ELEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO- A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE TWENTY BASED. ORGANIZATIONS REQUESTED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION- FOR THE SIXTY THREE MILLION THAT WAS AVAILABLE BETWEEN THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND WARM HAND OFF. RICHIE SERVICES PAPA- THAT SAID WILL BE KILEY. FOR OCT OF THIS YEAR APRIL THIRTY TWO TWENTY. AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE PSC BOARD- WILL MAKE A FINAL DECISION AS SOON AS SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SOFTBALL PAS THERE FOR NOW AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ON SENATOR NEWMAN ANY. ALLEN'S CLASS AS YOU CHRISTIAN BUT MY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FUNDING IS COMING. IN THE FORM OF ONE TIME GRANTS IN EACH SUCCESSIVE BUDGET YEARS ARE CORRECT. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO ONGOING FUNDING FOR THIS IS DEREK. IT IS AN ONGOING FUNDING PROGRAM- IT'S BEEN SUPPLEMENTED WITH- INCREASE FUNDING AND AN ESCALATING YEARS IN THE BUDGET IN THE PAST SUCH ACTS OKAY ALL RIGHT PRECIADO SAID DAD THAT'S APPROACHING THANK AND WHAT IS THAT ONGOING FUNDING REMIND REMIND US AGAIN- WELL IT'S IN- THAT SO LET'S SEE THE INITIAL ALLOCATION WAS. A FIFTY MILLION THIRTY SEVEN BILLION. AND THEN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED A ONE TIME INCREASE THAT PROVIDED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION. SIXTY SEVEN BEING THE TOTAL. CORRECT SPLIT BETWEEN OUR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND WARM AND OFFERING. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WAS SIXTY SEVEN MILLION NOBODY BUT MY NOTES SHOW THAT THAT. ONGOING OF THAT THIRTY SEVEN IS NOT GOING TO THIRTY. THIRTY IS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS ARE CORRECT SO THE THIRTY SEVEN MINUS THE ON GOING FUNDING. UNDERSTOOD SO WELL SO WHAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER BOB DONNAN ONGOING BASIS IF YOU KNOW IF WE ARE EACH YEAR. ADDING ONE TIME FUNDS HAD SIMPLY HAVE TO MEET THAT THAT'S- YOU KNOW DE FACTO THE ONGOING NEED. YET PARTS OF THIRTY SEVEN MINUS THE REGULAR OF IT BUT I'M GOING FUNDING CORRECT. NO THAT'S OTHER QUESTIONS IS WHAT LIKE WHAT WOULD YOU SAY AS WE LOOK FOR. WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE ONGOING NEED SO YOUKNOW WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE A SURPLUS RIGHT NOW WE WON'T HAVE IT FOREVER. SO IT'S IMPORTANT MAKE SURE THAT WOULD THAT THESE THINGS DON'T. SUFFER AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN OUR FISCAL POSITION OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT IF THEY IF THEY YIELD RESULTS. SURE MY APOLOGIES FOR MISUNDERSTANDING A QUESTION THIS WEEK- IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER IS IF I JUST FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY- ARE OUR MOST RECENT SOLICITATION LIKE I SAID WE RECEIVED. A REQUEST FOR IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION- IN TWENTY NINETEEN RECEIVED REQUESTS IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED NINE MILLION. SO THE NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO POINT DOWN- BUT THAT THEY'RE SO MANY IT YOU KNOW IS IN NEED AND WE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE ALLOCATE NOT AS MUCH FUN AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. READ AND I GUESS THAT YOU KNOW THE BEST MOST OBVIOUS METRIC FOR SUCCESS IS RECIDIVISM. THE END I GUESS THAT'S WHERE RECIDIVISM MAY COME AT RIGHT THERE'S A COUPLE OF. THOSE SINCE YOU KNOW THEIR TESTIMONY THIS COUPLE AREAS WHERE DATA ANALYSIS PROBABLY. NECESSARY VERY USEFUL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST USE OF FUNDS- I THINK INTUITIVELY KNOW THAT THESE YOU KNOW THAT THE ADULT REENTRY PROGRAMS FAR. EMILY EFFECTIVE BUT DID IT BE REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT BY WAY OF DATA SO THAT WE CAN MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AS TO HOW WE ALLOCATE FUNDS. SHOULD THANK YOU APPRECIATE JUST WANT THINGS. OKAY I THINK WE'RE DONE- OKAY JUST ONE QUESTION HOW MUCH OF FUNDING HAS GONE TOWARDS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING VERSES TRANSITIONAL OR EMERGENCY HOUSING. CAN YOU BREAK DOWN A BIT I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER READILY AVAILABLE WE CAN ABSOLUTELY PROVIDED TO YOU OKAY. PLEASE BECAUSE YOU ARE FOCUSED ON HOUSING RIGHT THAT IS ALL ABSOLUTELY YEAH WE HAVE. THE GENERIC RENTAL ASSISTANCE- COMPLAINING THAT THIS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING BUT FOR THAT THAT MORE DETAILED BREAKDOWN WOULD HAVE TO JUST. PUT THE NUMBERS TOGETHER JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. GREAT OKAY IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- I THINK THAT'S IT SENATORS NOTHING ELSE WE'RE DONE HERE FOR THE- WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO A PUBLIC COMMENT- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS THAT- WERE PRESENTED TODAY ON TODAY'S AGENDA THE IF YOU'RE CALLING IN THE NUMBERS. IS SEVEN SIX TWO TWO FOUR SIX TWO- WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT. EVERYONE PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC COMMENT KEEP YOUR MARKS TO WITHIN ABOUT A MINUTE AND WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH WITNESSES HERE IN PERSON IN THE HEARING ROOM- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO. TESTIFY GIVE SOME TESTIMONY PLEASE COME RIGHT UP. I SEE THAT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE. PERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.
