MEETING OF TUESDAY JUNE TWELFTH OKAY AT GOOD MORNING EVERYONE WE'RE GOING TO CONVENE THE JOINT HEARING OF WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE. ON RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION. AYE MR AYE CHAIRMAN BLOOM WILL BE JOINING US SHORTLY AND WE'LL. PAUSE FOR A MINUTE LET HIM SAY A FEW WORDS AND WELCOME EVERYONE. I AND THEN GET BACK ON THE AGENDA. I THINK YOU FOR ATTENDING. WITH MY A CO CHAIR. MISTER BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE BUDGET. AT THREE. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO FULFILL OUR PART. IN THE REVIEW OF INITIATIVE EIGHTEEN OF SIX WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE BOND FUNDS FOR VARIOUS WATER AND GROUNDWATER PROJECTS. STEINBERG INITIATIVE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO HOLD JOINT HEARINGS ON ANY OUTSIDE INITIATIVE THAT RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE SIGNATURES REQUIRED TO QUALIFY FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. I KNOW WE ALL WE'RE HERE ARE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION ON S. B. FIVE WHICH MET WITH VOTER APPROVAL AS. PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT ON THE BALLOT LAST TUESDAY. IN YOUR PACKET WE HAVE SOME COMPARISONS OF THE BOND AS WELL AS SOME QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE INITIATIVE. AT BEFORE US A ROLL TODAY'S THE HIGHLIGHT ISSUES ASK QUESTIONS AND GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOND WE WILL NOT BE TAKING A VOTE. ON THE INITIATIVE TODAY WE WILL FIRST YEAR FROM MAJOR ALORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THEY HAVE THE TASK OF PROVIDING THE PUBLIC WITH AN IMPARTIAL HOUSES OF THE SPAWN. TO THAT END WE THANK HER FOR HER WORK AND LOOK FORWARD TO REPRESENTATION. FOLLOWING THE ALLEY O. PRESENTATION WE WILL HEAR FROM BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION TO THE BOND. WE ASK IF ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS COULD LIMIT THE TESTIMONY TO FIVE MINUTES. WE WILL FOLLOW WITH QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS FROM BOTH COMMITTEES UP PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME DOLLARS BUT. BEFORE SHE BEGINS OF MISTER BLOOM AND. COMMENTED LIKE TO MAKE. GOOD MORNING SORRY FOR BEING A FEW MINUTES LATE LET'S GET TO IT. THE SELLERS I WELCOME. GOOD MORNING TEARS A MEMBERS RACHEL EHLERS WITH ALLEGE ANALYST'S OFFICE SIDE OF THE SERGEANTS PASSING A HAND OUT FROM WHICH I'LL SPEAK AT THE HAND IT SHOULD ALSO BE ON OUR WEBSITE. AND I BELIEVE ON THAT COMMITTEE WEBSITE AS WELL FOR THOSE FOLLOWING LONG THE PUBLIC. SO AS AS THE CHAIRMANSHIP I'LL JUST GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DESCRIBING THE PROPOSITION AND IT'S FISCAL EFFECTS ON STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO STARTING ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT JUST AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT OUR ROLE IS IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IT'S TWO FOLD FIRST BEFORE WHEN INITIATIVE THEIR FIRST. SUBMITTED BY STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT WE PREPARE AN IMPARTIAL FISCAL ANALYSIS OF EACH INITIATIVE TO GO WHEN IT GOES OUT FOR SIGNATURES AS WELL AS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE FISCAL EFFECTS ARE. ON STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO WHEN YOU'RE APPROACH OUTSIDE SAFE WAY YOU CAN ASK THEM IN AND SEE. WHAT WE HAVE WRITTEN? DESCRIBING WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR SIGNATURES AYE WE OFTEN REFER TO THAT AS THE TITLE AND SUMMARY AND I BELIEVE A COPY OF THE TITAN SUMMARY FOR THIS. INITIATIVE IS INCLUDED IN YOUR MEMBER PACKET FOR THIS HEARING. THEN SECONDLY IF FOR THOSE INITIATIVES THAT DUE QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT STATE ROTH REQUIRES OUR OFFICE TO PROVIDE AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS. OF THE BALLOT PROPOSITION WHAT IT DOES AND WHAT THE. I HAVE FISCAL EFFECTS WILL BE FOR THE VOTERS SO THAT. SOMETIMES LIMON SOMETIMES DOOR STOP WHERE THE. BALLOT GUIDE THAT YOU GET IN THE MAIL AS A VOTER THOSE CONTAINED THE DESCRIPTIONS THAT WE. AND PREPARE FOR THE ANALYSIS SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING THOSE MATERIALS RIGHT NOW FOR THE INITIATIVES THAT HAVE ALREADY QUALIFIED OR LOOK TO QUALIFY FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. LAST I CHECKED I BELIEVE THEREFORE THAT HAVE QUALIFIED INCLUDING THIS IN AN ADDITIONAL NINE THAT ARE IN THE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR NOVEMBER. SO. THIS IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ROLE FOR OFFICE THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO SEEING US. COME BEFORE YOU WE WON'T OFFER ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ANY. OPINIONS OR SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES WE REALLY ARE HERE. IN JUST A FACTUAL ROLE WHAT DOES THE MEASURE DO AND I WHAT DO WE BELIEVE THAT FISCAL EFFECTS MAY BE ON THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT WILL BE AFFECTED BOTH OF MY PRESENTATION AS WELL AS ANY. RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK. SO TURNING THE PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT. BECAUSE THIS BOND US PROVIDE MANY FOR WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS JUST A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON CURRENT SPENDING. AND FUNDING FOR THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THE VAST MAJORITY AS A FUNDING FOR WATER RELATED PROJECTS COMES FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL ITS LOCAL MONEY FOR PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THIS AFFECTS THINGS LIKE DRINKING WATER SEWER AND WASTE WATER SYSTEMS FLOOD CONTROL ALL AGRICULTURAL WATER THAT RESIDENTS PAY FOR THE MAJORITY OF THESE SPENDING WHY WHEN THEY PAY THEIR MONTHLY BILLS. THE STATE PROVIDE SOME FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS PRIMARILY FROM BOND FUNDS. IN THE FORM OF LOANS AND GRANTS AND THEN THE OTHER CATEGORY OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BOND WE TERM ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS PROJECTS TO IMPROVE THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT CLEANING PROTECTING HABITAT. I IN THE STATE OF PLAY A BIGGER ROLE TYPICALLY IN FUNDING FOR THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES OFTEN FROM BONDS. COM SO IN RECENT YEARS WE ESTIMATE THE STATE HAS BEEN ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THESE TYPES OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS THAT'S ROUGHLY THE BUDGETS FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT DO THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. VOTER PROVIDES ARE A COMMON SOURCE OF FUNDING FROM THE STATE FOR THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES I THINK THERE'S A CHART IN EUROPE IN YOUR BACKGROUND MATERIAL SINCE TWO THOUSAND. VOTERS HAVE APPROVED THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN A RESOURCE RELATED BONDS THAT INCLUDES THE FOUR BILLION THAT WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS JUST A WEEK AGO TODAY. IN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT AND THE STATE'S CURRENTLY PAYING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN DEBT SERVICE FOR. THOSE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BONDS. SO TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT SOME BACKGROUND ON THIS PROPOSAL THAT IS BEFORE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. HI THIS IS AN EIGHT POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR BOND EIGHT POINT EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN TO BE SPECIFIC. WE PROVIDE A TABLE HERE THAT SUMMARIZES THE ACTIVITIES. THAT WILL BE FUNDED IN THE BOND AND SIX BROAD CATEGORIES BUT THE. PROPOSITION ITSELF INCLUDES ABOUT A HUNDRED DISCRETE CATEGORIES ARE POTS OF FUNDING. AND THAT FOR HOW THE FUNDS SHOULD BE USED THOSE INCLUDE FUNDING FOR PARTICULAR REGIONS OF THE STATE. FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FIRST CATEGORY SHOWN IN THE FIGURE WATERSHED LANDS THERE ARE ABOUT FIFTY SUB CATEGORIES OF FUNDING. SOME OF THEM ARE RELATIVELY% LARGE THERE'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY FOR SIERRA NEVADA WATERSHEDS TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE SOLVENCY. AND THEN SOME SMALLER. AS WELL INCLUDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS EACH FOR SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL RIVER PARKWAY HE'S. THE SECOND CATEGORY SHOWN HERE WATER SUPPLY VARIOUS TYPES OF ACTIVITIES STRIKING WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT WATER RECYCLING STORM WATER RUNOFF. THE THIRD CATEGORY FISH AND WILDLIFE IS SAM ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE HABITATS INCLUDING PURCHASING WATER FOR WETLANDS AND AGAIN SUB CATEGORIES FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF SPECIES THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO HELP RESTORE NATIVE FISH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION FOR MIGRATORY BIRD HABITAT. THE FOURTH CATEGORY DOWN WATER FACILITY UPGRADES IS ACTUALLY JUST FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED IN THAT CATEGORY THEIR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE MADERA FRANKLIN CAN NOW. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR BAY AREA WATER RELIABILITY. TO HUNDRED MILLION FOR OROVILLE DAM AND FIVE MILLION FOR THE NORTH BAY AQUEDUCT SO THAT LARGE CATEGORIES JUST FOR. THE NEXT CATEGORY DOWN GROUNDWATER THE BOOK ABOUT MANY IS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT SIGMA PHI WOULD BE GRANTS FOR LOCAL GROUND WATER AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THEIR. SUSTAINABILITY PLANS THERE'S ALSO FUNDING IN THAT CATEGORY FOR AYE DESALINATION OF GROUND WATER TO MAKE IT MORE USABLE. AND THEN THE FINAL CATEGORY FLOOD PROTECTION VISITS TO FOR PROJECTS TO REDUCE FLOOD RISK BUT ALSO. A LANGUAGE BE SUGGESTING THAT THOSE PROJECTS SHOULD I PROVIDE OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS TO THE ECOSYSTEM AND. WATER SUPPLY. SO TURNING TO PAGE FOR A FEW MORE PROVISIONS. RELATED TO THIS PROPOSITION. SOMEWHAT UNIQUE FROM OTHER TYPES OF RESOURCES BONDS THE THIS PROPOSITION WOULD CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE ALL FUNDS. SO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NOT APPROPRIATE THESE FUNDS THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACT INSTEAD DEPARTMENTS WOULD RECEIVE THE FUNDING WHEN THEY'RE READY TO SPEND IT. YOU MAY RECALL THAT THERE WAS A PORTION OF PROPOSITION ONE FOR WATER STORAGE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION THAT WAS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED BUT THE SYSTEM THIS IS UNIQUE TO HAVE THE ENTIRE BOND BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. SO MUCH OTHER BONDS MOST OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE A DISTRIBUTED FOR VIA GRANTS TO LOCAL AGENCIES SOME ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS AND THEN IN SOME CATEGORIES IT JUST HAM. THAT PROPOSITION IDENTIFIES WHICH LOCAL AGENCIES FORGET HOW MUCH FUNDING. THERE SOME FUNDING FOR STATE AGENCIES TO DO SOME STATE LEVEL PROJECTS BUT THE MAJORITY IS A LOCAL GRANTS. FOR SOME OF THE CATEGORIES IN PARTICULAR THOSE RELATED TO WATER SUPPLY DRINKING WATER WASTEWATER TREATMENT THERE ARE LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME OTHER BONDS. FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF STATE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED THE LOCAL AGENCY WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE A MATCH ALTHOUGH IT'S THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE WAIVED IN SOME CASES AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT. I'M THE FIRST ALSO SIMILAR TO SOME OF OUR RECENT BONDS INCLUDING PROPOSITION ONE IN SIXTY EIGHT THE PROPOSITION HAVE SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS INTENDED TO BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. USES THE SAME DEFINITION OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AS HAS BEEN USED IN PREVIOUS BONDS. SO SOME OF THOSE PROVISIONS ARE IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES IT REQUIRES THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING BE. ALLOCATED TO THOSE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES AND AND. MANY CASES WAVES THAT LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENT IF FOR THOSE AND COMMUNITIES MEETING OF THAT INCOME REQUIREMENTS. SO TUNING TO THE FINAL PAGE ON THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF THIS BOND AGAIN WE. BREAK THIS INTO TWO CATEGORIES WHAT WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS WILL BE TO THE STATE. AND THEN WHAT WE ESTIMATE THAT COSTS ARE SAVINGS MAY BE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO FOR THE STATE. I WE ESTIMATE THE COST TO TOTAL COSTS TO TAXPAYERS TO REPAY THE BOND WOULD BE SEVENTEEN POINT THREE BILLION. THAT'S THE EIGHT POINT NINE FOR THE PRINCIPAL AND THEN WE ESTIMATE POINT FOUR BILLION IN INTEREST OVER FORTY YEARS. AND WE ESTIMATE THIS WOULD RESULT IN AVERAGE COST TO THE GENERAL FUND OF AROUND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS ESTIMATE I'M RELATED TO HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO SELL THAT BOND AND USE THE FUNDS WE ESTIMATE TEN YEARS. THEN THE REBEKAH IN ADDITIONAL THIRTY YEAR REPAYMENT. PLAN AND AND WE ESTIMATE OF FIVE PERCENT INTEREST RATE TO TO THE DEGREE THAT THOSE. FACTORS CHANGE IF THE FUNDS BONDS ARE SOLD MORE QUICKLY OR OVER A LONGER PERIOD OR INTEREST RATES ARE DIFFERENT OBVIOUSLY THOSE NUMBERS WOULD CHANGE BUT THAT'S OUR ESTIMATE. AND HAS BEEN PRETTY STANDARD. FOR HOW WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT AFFECTS A BONDS IN RECENT YEARS. AND THEN TURNING TO THE LOCAL COSTS AND SAVINGS AGAIN THIS IS SOMEWHAT HARD TO ESTIMATE. IN CASES WHERE THE STATE BONDS ARE REPLACING LOCAL MONEY IF IT'S A PROJECT AT A LOCAL AGENCY WOULD BE UNDERTAKING ANYWAY USING THEIR LOCAL FUNDS AND INSTEAD THEY CAN USE STATE FUNDS. THAT WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND TO THE DEGREE THAT LOCAL AGENCIES TAKE ON PROJECTS THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE TAKE ON OR TAKE ON LARGER PROJECTS AND HAVE TO PUT IN SOME OF THEIR OWN FUNDING FOR THAT EITHER THROUGH THE MATCH REQUIREMENT. OR FROM ONGOING MAINTENANCE THAN THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE INCURRED. THE TYPES OF A BY FUNDING INCLUDED IN THIS BOND IN THE TYPES OF PROJECTS WE THINK PROBABLY IT WILL RESULT IN LOCAL SAVINGS AND OTHER WORDS THAT FIRST CATEGORY THAT THIS WILL FUND PROJECTS THAT LOCALS. WOULD HAVE UNDERTAKEN OTHERWISE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SICK MY. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF CLEAN WATER ACT TO MEET THEIR WATER SUPPLY DEMANDS. AND SO WE ESTIMATE THIS PROBABLY WILL RESULT WOULD RESULT IN SOME LOCAL SAVINGS PERHAPS UP TO A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ON BASED ON THOSE CATEGORIES. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS BEST UP. THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION I HAVE PURCHASED A ONE SIMPLE QUESTION ON PAGE FOUR WAYS IS A PROVIDING FUNDING FOR DISADVANTAGED. A COMMUNITY IS SO I THOUGHT WHEN WE NEED THE WATER WE NEED SUCH A DEGENERATE FOR ANY HAD NO REST DOES. IN THAT COMMUNITY WHY. DO YOU SEPARATE DISADVANTAGED WHILE ADVANTAGE OF COMMUNITIES. SO A THOUGH THE WHY BEHIND IT I THINK WOULD BE OF MORE APPROPRIATE QUESTION FOR THE PROPONENTS I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THIS HAS BEEN A TRADITIONAL PRACTICE IN RECENT YEARS WITH BONDS TO TRY AND DIRECT THESE FUNDING I WITH PRIORITIZATION FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH LOCAL FUNDING TO UNDERTAKE THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS THEMSELVES. EXCEPT WHEN THERE'S A NEED FOR THE WATER AWAY IMPROVING WHAT THAT I AM SO SUPPLY. IT SHOULD APPLY TO ANY COMMUNITY WHETHER. YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE COMMUNITY IT MAY BE IS SO HE SO. NOT QUITE INTERESTING TO CANADA WHERE I SET A SPECIFIC. YEAH I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OF THE PROPONENTS WHO DESIGNED THE INITIATIVE THEY'LL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ALASKA TOM. SUPPORTERS OF THE. INITIATIVE TO COME FORWARD AND MISTER MARROW. IS THE AUTHOR AND DESTINY TO WITH AQUA. MORE TO MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO US SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE. I'M JURY MARROW I AM THE PROPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE AND A FORMERLY SERVED AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE STATE RESOURCES AGENCY. ARE ALL ESPECIALLY ON WATER ISSUES. WHY ARE WE HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU ARE WE WE MADE A PRETTY STRONG EFFORT TO TRY TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF A SENATE BILL SIXTY EIGHT SENATE BILL FIVE WHICH TURNED INTO PROP SIXTY EIGHT? WE THOUGHT THAT IDEALLY THAT MEASURE WOULD INCLUDE MORE OF BENEFITS FOR THE WATER SIDE OF THINGS HEADED DID INCLUDE SOME VERY GOOD ONES. BUT ARE WE FAILED IN THAT EFFORT I SUPPOSE THE BLAME NEEDS TO GO TO US ON THAT WE DIDN'T BE PERHAPS TRY STRONGLY ENOUGH BUT WE FELT THAT. THE NEED OF TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES WAS LARGE ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED IN THE. WANT TO MENTION JUST A FEW MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT. IS THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ELEMENT WE BELIEVE THAT OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO DO NOT HAVE A SAFE DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES. REPREHENSIBLE AND. JUST OF SOME OF THAT HAS TO BE SOLVED LEGISLATURE'S BEEN GREAT IT CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BUT THE PROBLEM DOES CONTINUE WE'VE SOLVED THE PROBLEM MANY COMMUNITIES BUT WE HAVE MANY MANY MORE WHO HAVE NOT. YET GOTTEN THE SAFE DRINKING WATER SUPPLY WE HAVE TO HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THE WATER IS. IN THIS MEASURE IS REAL A SOMETIMES PEOPLE QUESTION THE THE AMOUNT OF WATER YOU CAN DEVELOP BY THESE WATER BONDS WE'VE CALCULATED IT'S ON OUR CAMPAIGN WEBSITE. THAT WE BELIEVE THIS MEASURE WILL DEVELOP ENOUGH WATER FOR THREE MILLION FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S ONE AND A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET. PEOPLE USE ABOUT A HALF AN ACRE FOOT PER FAMILY SO YOU KNOW MAYBE UPWARDS OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ITS WATER RESOURCES. STATE CONTINUES TO GROW AGRICULTURE HAS DEMANDS WE HAVE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. ANOTHER MAJOR CATEGORY THE ANALYST MENTIONED AS WATERSHED RESTORATION WE HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE A SITUATION THEY IN THE SIERRA NEVADA THE CASCADES AND MANY OF OUR OTHER WATERSHEDS. FIRE OF OVER GROWTH OF TREES CONSUMING WAY MORE WATER THAN THEY SHOULD AND IT'S NOT EVEN HEALTHY FOR THE FOREST WE HAVE TO START PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR WATERSHEDS ARE WE SIMPLY WON'T HAVE THE WATER SUPPLY WE'VE COME TO RELY ON. SO WE'VE INCLUDED A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAJOR WATERSHEDS AND MORE IN SOME OF THE SMALLER WATERSHEDS. TRY TO BRING THESE WATERSHEDS BACK TO THE SOURCE OF OUR WATER IN OUR WATER QUALITY WE HAVE TO DRESS THAT. WITH RESPECT TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE WITH THE WORST WATER SUPPLY ALMOST ALWAYS ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT REALLY DOES ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MR SETTLEMENT. REGARDING WHY SOME OF THE MONEY DOES IT A BIAS IN THE SENSE TOWARD DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF PLACES LIKE EAST BAY MURDER CENTER CLEAR WATER DISTRICT OR LADWP HAVE WONDERFUL RELIABLE WATER SUPPLIES PEOPLE ENJOY THEM. BUT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT AND SO. THAT THAT'S THE THE REASON REALLY THE MAIN REASON FOR OR BIASING SOME OF THIS MONEY TOWARD DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS IS REAL WATER IN THIS MEASURE ITS OF WATER COMING FROM WASTE WATER RECYCLING A DE SALTING. AGRICULTURAL URBAN WATER CONSERVATION A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER PROVEN PRODUCTION METHOD SO THAT WHAT MEASURE. THE MEASURE WILL PRODUCE REAL WATER FOR CALIFORNIA. A KEY EL LAW THAT YOU PASSED THE END OF THE LOT OF CREDIT GOES TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIS WAS THE SUSTAINABLE GROW WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. WE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO IT'S AN ACT THAT'S NOW GOING INTO EFFECT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE WATER DISTRICTS ARE TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT THAT WE HAVE NOT FUNDED IN A BIG WAY YET NOW IS THE TIME TO BEGIN TO FUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT BILL BECAUSE OUR WATER SUPPLIES ARE REALLY OUT OF BALANCE DUE TO GROW WATER OVERDRAFT. AS WAS MENTIONED WE DO HAVE WATER FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE I WANT EMPHASIZE ONE CATEGORY AND THAT IS THE NEED TO RESTORE DELTA FISHERIES ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS AND ALSO LOCAL ONES LIKE COUNTRY BECAUSE WATER DISTRICT. IS THE FACT THAT WE CANNOT EXPORT THE WATER WE NEED FROM THE DELTA BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE TO HAVE OUT FLOW THROUGH THE DELTA FOR ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES. WE HAVE PROVEN METHODS TO BRING THOSE FISH BACK IT CAN BE DONE ITS NOT A PIPE DREAM WE'VE SEEN OUR THE OH BYPASS THAT YOU CAN RESTORE THE SPECIES. BUT IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE SO WE HAVE A LARGE INVESTMENT THAT YOU MIGHT SAY IS FISHERIES BUT IN FACT IT'S ALL ABOUT WATER SUPPLY. AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT IS TO TRY TO RESTORE THOSE SPECIES AND ALSO TO FIRM UP OUR WATER SUPPLIES. WE THINK THE FUNDS IN THE MEASURE ARE DISTRIBUTED FAIRLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA ABOUT WHAT EACH DISTRICT WOULD BENEFIT BY WE THINK THAT'S BEEN DONE FAIRLY. AND JUST IN CLOSING WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THOSE WHO'VE ENDORSED THIS MEASURE. OF FIRST OF ALL AGRICULTURE WERE TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSED THEY HAVE THE FARM BUREAU AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL THE. WESTERN GROWERS AND MANY COMMODITY GROUPS ENDORSING US AND HELPING US TO GET MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUPPORTIVE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP BIZ FED BELLY INDUSTRY COVERS ASSOCIATION BAYER COUNCIL MANY OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS AND LOCAL CHAMBERS. A CITY WILL TALK ABOUT THE WATER SUPPORT I'M SURE BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE AN UNUSUAL PAIRING. OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER SUSPICION IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER COALITION WE DON'T GET THAT EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA WATER POLITICS. AND FINALLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND MANY OTHER GROUPS WE HAVE MORE THAN SEVENTY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WHO ENDORSE THIS MEASURE STATE FEDERAL NATIONAL. I KNOW THIS YEAR CLUB OPPOSE THE GONNA TALK TO YOU I'M THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS YEAR CLUB WATER COMMITTEE WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS MEASURE BUT WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE A BRIEF PRESENTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR GARCIA AND MEMBER CINDY TALK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. AWKWARD WE REPRESENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON THEY ARE BIG AND SMALL TOGETHER THEY PROVIDE ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE WATER THAT'S DISTRIBUTED IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PUBLIC FOR AGRICULTURE IN FOR BUSINESS NGUYEN TO TOUCH VERY BRIEFLY ON FIVE TOPICS ONE IS OUR POSITION. TO SAFE DRINKING WATER THREE GROUND WATER FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND ON FIVE JUST TOUCH ON SALTON SEA. SO FIRST ON OUR POSITION OR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MET LAST NOVEMBER THEY TOOK UP BOTH THIS BOND AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT REVIEW THEM TOGETHER. AND DECIDED TO SUPPORT BOTH BOND SO WE ARE IN SOURCING BOTH OF THEM. LAST NOVEMBER AT OUR FALL CONFERENCE WE HAVE A PANEL REGARDING THE TO BONDS PROP SIXTY EIGHT IN THIS BOND WE INVITED THE PROPONENTS FROM BOTH MEASURES TO COMES SO THAT OUR MEMBERS COULD LEARN ABOUT BOTH OF THEM. AND THE PROPONENTS SAID AT OUR CONFERENCE THAT THE TWO MEASURES ARE COMPLEMENTARY AND WE AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT ON FACT TO TAKE HOME FROM THIS THIS HEARING. WE ALSO THINK THAT THIS BOND WILL HELP IMPLEMENT FEE BROWN ADMINISTRATIONS CALIFORNIA WATER ACTION PLAN THAT PLAN TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO WATER THE ITEMS THAT I OR I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT ARE. PART OF THAT PLAN ON BUT THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH I WON'T GO INTO ON. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. SO GETTING RIGHT INTO THE ITEMS SAFE DRINKING WATER MISTER MALE TOUCHED ON THAT. THIS SPOON WOULD INCLUDE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER THAT IS PRIORITIZE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THAT'S IN ADDITION TO. PROP SIX STATE WITH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION YOU MAY ASK NO WASN'T THERE SOME MONEY IN PROP ONE FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAN THERE WAS THERE WAS THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION. THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF ALLOCATING THAT MONEY AND THEY TELL US THAT THAT MONEY IS BASIC EITHER ALLOCATED OR IN PROCESS. SO THAT MONEY IS IS REALLY OBLIGATED. THAT'S THE REPORT FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD. SO WE THINK THIS MONEY IS GREATLY NEEDED AND WILL HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THEN MOVING ON TO GROUND WATER THIS BOND. HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN IT FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT WORK. IF YOU WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THAT WAS THE YEAR END EXCUSE ME THAT THE BOND WAS GOING THROUGH THE WATER BOND WAS GOING THROUGH BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE WORKMEN SEGMENT WITH HAPPENING. AND SEGMENT WASN'T FINISH TILL NEAR THE END OF SESSION AND I THINK HAD IT BEEN FINISHED EARLIER. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE MONEY IN PROP ONE THAT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE TO SNEAKING IT IN AT THE END FOR GROUNDWATER ON THE SIGNAL MONEY AND. IT INCLUDED A HUNDRED MILLION THAT IT'S ALREADY HOME DONE. AND BY THE WAY HAVE TO COMPLEMENT THE RESOURCES AGENCY FOR. BEING VERY TRANSPARENT YOU CAN GO ON THEIR WEBSITE AND SEE WHERE EVERY PART OF PROP ONE HAS GONE IN AND THAT KIND OF THING IT'S VERY HELPFUL. THE INSIGNIA IMPLEMENTATION IT REQUIRED THE CREATION OF SYSTEM SUSTAINABLE GRAHAM WATER AGENCIES THE GSA'S. OUR GRANDMOTHER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES THERE ARE NO TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT OF THOSE CREATED SO WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT NEW LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE SLAVIC HAVE TO DEVELOP PLANS. AND THEN IMPLEMENT THEM SO THIS MONEY IN IN IN THIS POND WOULD ALLOW ON GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROJECTS TO GO FORWARD. SUSTAINABILITY PLAN PROJECTS TO GO FORWARD THERE'S MONEY YOU CAN USE FOR SALT WATER INTRUSION PROJECTS WHICH IS SO SIGNIFICANT ISSUE ON THE CENTRAL COAST. AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANS SO WE THAT'S ONE OF THE PIECES OF THE SPAWN THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON REALLY CRITICAL FUNDING. THEN FOURTH ON CONSERVATION THE LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED HARD THIS YEAR THERE'S TWO BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THAT'S WORKING TO MAKE CONSERVATION A WAY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS FUND WOULD INCLUDE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND IT SPECIFIES THAT THAT MONEY CAN GO FOR THINGS LIKE TURF REMOVAL LEAK DETECTION WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. ON TWELVE REPLACEMENT WATER METERS AND PROJECTS THAT NOT ONLY CONSERVE WATER BUT SAVE ENERGY. SO YOU THINK THAT'S A GREAT CATEGORY IN THIS BOND. AND THE LAST WHEN I WAS GING TO TOUCH ON THE SALTON SEA THE SPAWNING CLUES TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE SALTON SEA. AND TWENTY MILLION OF THAT AT LEAST TWENTY MILLION LOGO FOR NEW RIVER WORK WHICH IS CRITICAL IF YOU'VE EVER. BEEN DOWN IN TOWARD THAT AREA I YOU KNOW MONEY IS NEEDED. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY NOT BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS RIGHT. ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND QUESTIONS. SO. THERE'S MANY MANY ASPECTS OF THIS THAT I. Y. CAN THAT DEFINITELY BENEFIT MY DISTRICT. MY BIGGEST QUESTION AND KIND OF CONCERN HERE IS. YOU KNOW DO DOING RECHARGE DOING GROUNDWATER CLEANUP. BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST IN IN VIETNAM TOURS IN IN. HE EVEN VISITING COACHELLA VALLEY AND SEEN SONG SEE. THAT THE PROBLEM THAT WE KEEP RUNNING INTO IS WE THROW MONEY AT IT. AND WE'LL GET A TREATMENT CENTER AND OR WHAT WILL GET SOMETHING FOR TOGETHER FLOYD. THE FOLKS IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES JUST SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP RUNNING THE FACILITIES THAT WE BUILT. AND I'VE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO MY CONCERN IS THE ONGOING FUNDS BEYOND THE BALL. NON. YOU KNOW ARE WE DOING ANYTHING WITHIN THIS TO SPEED UP THE AYE OUR PROCESSES. OF FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE. YOU KNOW HOW WE GONNA GET PASS THE THE SEQUEL PROCESS ON DOING THIS. ON THE THERE SEVERAL ASPECTS HERE THAT I THINK. THERE WERE STILL KINDA MISSING. IT I THINK REALLY HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BLOOD I I'VE GOT A LOT OF CONCERNS BECAUSE. I SEE IT ON THE DAY TO DAY BACK ON MY DISTRICT SPECIALLY CUT COMING FROM THE CITY OF PORTABLE WERE WERE WHICH IS DEALT WITH THE CITY WITHOUT WATER FOR FIVE YEARS. THE OTHER EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER FUND IT IS GREAT BUT IT RUNS OUT. AND WITH BONDS THE MONEY IS GREAT BUT IT RUNS OUT AND. WHAT ARE WE DOING AS AN ON GOING? SUSTAINABILITY. BECAUSE WHAT WHAT I SEE AS A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ARE NOT AGREE PROJECTS THAT THAT HAVE NEEDED TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW OF A DECADE AGO. AND AND NOW WE'RE GIVING THE MONEY IN THIS BONTA TO PUT FORWARD TO THE VOTERS. BOY. A AT THE END OF THE DAY AFTER THE PROJECTS COMPLETE. WHAT IS THERE ON THE MAIN SIDE FOR ONGOING EXPENSE? HOW ARE WE SPEEDING UP THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE TO GET IT BUILT? QUICKER FASTER AND SOONER. A ONE OF MY BIGGEST CROATIANS I KEEP BRINGING UP AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND IN REGARDS THE SIGMA HE'S THE ONLY WAY TO DO TRUE RECHARGE EXPRESSLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IF YOU GOT TO GET THROUGH THE CLAY LAYER WHICH INVOLVES INJECTION WELLS WHICH ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. THE HOUSE APART A QUESTION YOU FOLKS IS THE IS THIS GONNA COVER THE COST OF INJECTION WELLS. PAIRED WITH. YOU KNOW WETLANDS HABITAT BECAUSE YOU ONLY SEE DO OUR. WELL THIS HABITAT FOR WATERFOWL INDOOR PLUMBING BASE AND IN THE END SEEK. GRAVITY INJECTION WELL RIGHT THE MIDDLE OF IT. ON I KNOW I'VE HAD TALKS WITH WATER BOARD MEMBERS ON DOING THINGS LIKE THAT. WHY? YOU NO IT IN THAT I MEAN IT'S WATER IS STILL HOLISTIC AND IT'S SUCH A. SAYING WHERE YOU CAN'T JUST SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO RECHARGE BECAUSE RECHARGE GONNA. THE GROUNDWATER. AND YOU KNOW THE CONTAMINATION IN THOSE THINGS FOR CLEANING UP AS WELL. ARE. YOU KNOW SO IT'S. OBVIOUSLY THIS DOES PROVIDE MORE WATER. AND MORE FRESH WATER IN IT FIXES SOME OF THE CONVEYANCE ISSUES THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH. BUT IT'S MY IT MY REAL CONCERN IS WE'RE GOING TO ALL THESE GREAT THINGS. IF THE VOTERS PASSED THE BALL I. WHERE DOES IT LEAVE THE SUSTAINABILITY SIDE SO IF YOU CAN MOTHER BUT GREAT DRESS SOME OF THAT? FAMILIAR CAN TRY TO TAKE THEM THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA GET BACK HOME VERY POINT WHEN I TALK TO FOLKS BACK HOME THEY THEY LAY ASSEMBLYMAN. WOLFE WELL THAT'S GREAT WE'RE GONNA THROW MORE MONEY AT THE PROBLEM FULL I. YOU KNOW HOW WE GONNA DO THIS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER THIS RESULT SO IF YOU THOSE ISSUES THEY'RE ALL CRITICAL ISSUES AND AND AND VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE NEW FACILITIES ARE AFFORDABLE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES REALLY IMPORTANT AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PROBLEMS. PORTERVILLE I THINK WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM CONNECTING THOSE. AREAS THE YEAR OF NO OR POOR WATER WITH OTHER DISTRICTS WHO NEAR NEARBY WHO ARE WELL FUNDED. CAN MANAGE THE SYSTEMS AND NOT HAVE TO RELY TOTALLY ON THE PEOPLE WHO WRE JUST BEING CONNECTED UP AND THERE'S AN INTERESTING REPORT BY I THINK WAS PP I SEE. SHOWING THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING BUT WHO ARE REALLY NEARBY LIKE FIVE HUNDRED FEET FROM A LOCAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT. THAT JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO CONNECT UP AND I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM THOSE SMALL REALLY TINY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REALLY POOR. THEY DO HAVE THE PROBLEM OF MAINTENANCE WE ALLOW THREE YEARS OF MAINTENANCE MONEY BUT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO SOLVE THAT. SO. I THINK THE BOARD IS GOING TO GIVE PREFERENCE WHERE THERE'S A NEARBY YOUR GOSHEN DISTRICT OR WATER DISTRICT TO DO CONNECTIONS. AND THAT IS PORTABLE THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU CAN SOLVE THE PROBES A WONDERFUL PICTURE IN THEIR REPORT OF A COUPLE IN PORTABLE GETTING THEIR NEW WATER YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN IT. I WAS THERE YEAH. SO THAT IS A MODEL WE NEED TO FOLLOW THEIR OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE JUST TOO FAR. AND THOSE ARE GONNA HAVE TO FIND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND MAYBE TRY TO ACCUMULATE THEM AT LEAST INTO ONE SISTER THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONSIDER THOSE ARE THOSE ARE PROBLEM. FIFTH OF MILES ON THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE AND THERE'S A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE. AYE AYE SCENE ARSENIC TREATMENT PLANTS THAT ARE BRAND NEW THAT THEY JUST SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO RUN ITS IT IT'S A COMPLETE PROBLEM AND WE CAN'T HAVE A BOND GOING PAYING ON THE GOING SUBSIDIES OBVIOUSLY. SO THE WATER BOARD ETHNIC A PRETTY HARD LOOK AT IT AND NOT PUT IN SOMETHING THAT SIMPLY CAN'T BE OPERATED. BUT I WILL SAY THIS OF THE NEED ACCORDING TO THE WATER BOARD IS IN THE MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOTALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND WE DIRECT THEM TO DO PROJECTS THAT CAN BE FINANCED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE A HARD LOOK AND SAY WE. CAN'T GIVE YOU SOMETHING YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MAINTAIN BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER ONES WHERE THEY CAN OR CONNECT UP. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS YOU GROW WATER POINT WHICH IS REALLY GOOD. A I DID TO HER FIREBAUGH RECENTLY AND THEY HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD A FORMER ORCHARD BUT THEY SAID NO WE NEED TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AND THEY'RE. FARTHER EAST OF THE CLAY LAYERS NOT INTERFERING WITH THEM AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO HELP STABILIZE GROUNDWATER LEVELS BY PUTTING IN RECHARGE ESPECIALLY THE FLOOD WATER WHICH IS THE MOST AVAILABLE. TO TRY TO STABILIZE THESE WELL SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION IN THESE COMMUNITIES CAN CONTINUE TO USE THEM. SO SICK MORE I THINK OFFERS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO STABILIZE GROW WATER IN PLACES WHERE THEY ARE RELYING ON SHALLOW WELLS NOW IF YOU'RE FURTHER ON THE WEST SIDE YOU HAVE A CLEAR PROBLEM. INJECTIONS PRAGUE AB THE WAY THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THE BOND WORKS IS. WHATEVER THEY WANT SO THE LOCAL AGENCY GOES TO THE STATES HAS HERE'S OUR PLAN HERE'S OUR SUSTAINABILITY PLAN. WE THINK WE'LL SHOW THESE BENEFITS YOU FUNDED NDW ARE OFF TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PLANS TO FUND. BUT BOTH WOULD BE ELIGIBLE BOTH INJECTION AND GROUND WATER AFTER YOU THROUGH THE OUR PROCESS THEY DO OF ALTHOUGH SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE STATUTORILY EXEMPT LIKE THE FIREBALL PROJECT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T AFFECT ANY NATURAL ENVIRONMENT WAS AN OLD ORCHARD. AND THEY SIMPLY DUG THE PIT SO IF THERE ARE WAYS SOMETIMES TO AVOID THAT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THAT THE. SORRY FOR THE LONG. NO THANK YOU IT'S IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING PIECES. I. GUESS I'M STILL LIVING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION I GOT STUCK SOME BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT. KIND OF THE THE TIMING OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS TO HAVE THE MONEY THAT YOU WANT TO DO FOR THE PROJECTS THAT YOU WANT TO DO. AND THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS A DOLLARS ISSUED ALL BONDS APPROVED TO BE ISSUED. SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT IS THAT A PRACTICAL HOW IT CHALLENGE SO CAN YOU DRESS THAT AND ALSO. THAT THE SEQUENCING OF HOW FAST IS THE SPENDING THE MONEY YES BUT IN FACT IN OUR MUTUAL DISTRICT OTHERS AND GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT THE SMART TREAT. ADDITION OF THAT MY REFORM ORGANIZATION DIDN'T NINETEEN NINETY ALLOCATED MONEY FOR THE SMART TRAIN. BUT THE LOCAL COUNTIES WERE NOT ABLE TO APPROVE AND IMPLEMENT THAT PROJECT FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AFTER THAT PASSED. SO THE BONDS ARE NEVER SOLD THE STATE INCURRED NO INTEREST AND THEN FINALLY THE SMART AGENCY SAID OKAY WERE READY AND THEY WANT TO THE STATE SAID OKAY NOW YOU CAN SELL THAT LAST BIT OF REMAINING BONDS FROM PROP ONE SIXTEEN. AND SO FORTUNATELY WHEN A STATE AGENCY IS NOT READY TO IMPLEMENT A PROJECT THERE'S NO STATE DEBT INCURRED AND SO WE CAN WAIT AND AND IT MAY. BE MANY YEARS SOMETIMES IN THAT CASE IT WAS. HOWEVER OF WHEN THE STATE IS READY THE GO TO THE THE LOCAL AGENCY WOULD APPLY LET'S SAY A LOCAL WATER DISTRICT WAS APPLYING TO. DE OF YOU ARE FOR GRANT FOR ONE OF THESE PROJECTS. THEY WOULD SAY OKAY HERE'S A PROJECT A WE THINK IT'S COULD BE APPROVED OFTEN THE STATE WILL SAY YOU MUST PAY FOR THE PROJECT YOURSELF WILL REIMBURSE YOU THAT'S THE TYPICAL WAY THE STATE OPERATES. AND SO FINALLY AFTER THE PROJECT WAS BUILT IN THE REIMBURSEMENT WAS REQUESTED THE STATE WOULD GO TO THE PULLMAN INVESTMENT ACCOUNT OF THE TREASURE AND SAY NOW'S THE TIME SO BONDS ARE NEVER SOLD INTEREST IS NEVER OCCURRED. OFTEN UNTIL THE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY COMPLETED WHICH IS THE MOST DESIRABLE WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DEFER THAT DEBT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. BUT THERE IS THE ANALYST DIE HAS ON THEIR WEBSITE A REALLY GOOD ANALYSIS OF THE REMAINING FUNDS IN A LOT OF BONDS. OF PROP ONE NOW THEY HAVE THE THE. LARGE ALLOCATION OF STORAGE WAS THERE JUST NOW APPROVING OBVIOUSLY. AND DOES SO NO STATE BONDS HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR THAT BUT THEY WILL BE STARTING NEXT YEAR. SO TYPICALLY A BOND OF THIS SIZE IS THE ANALYST SAID WOULD TAKE TEN YEARS TO COMPLETELY SPEND DOWN PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX YEARS TO MOSTLY SPENT DOWN THERE WOULD BE THE NORMAL TIMELINE FOR THESE. I HOPE THAT ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. PLATE IF IT DOES BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE OTHER. CONCERN I HAVE MISTER MERRILL IS THAT THIS IS A. AN INITIATIVE THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY WAS BROUGHT DIRECTLY TO VOTERS RATHER THAN HAVING THE LEGISLATURE. OR THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION ESSENTIALLY WEIGH IN ON THAT. AND. I WHETHER THERE WOULD BE RETICENCE IN. THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE FUTURE TO GO AHEAD AND ISSUE THOSE BONDS IN AND IN FACT. RECOMMEND FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO GO AHEAD AND DO PRIOR SPENDING TO THE ISSUANCE OF THOSE BONDS WITH IF THERE'S ANY UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE OF THAT. I WANTED THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE UNDERSTAND. SO I AM AWARE OF AT LEAST THREE BONDS OF FOUR FIVE BONDS IT DIDN'T USE ISSUE PROCESS. A PARK BOND REAL BOND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL INTO WATER BONDS OF AND MAY BE FORGETTING SOMETHING. BUT IN ALL THOSE CASES UNDER BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS THEY TREAT THEM JUST LIKE REGULAR BONDS THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY HESITANCE TO PROVE OF THE ISSUANCE OF BONDS DONE TO THE INITIAL PROCESS COMPARED TO THE OTHER. AND IN FACT IN MY OWN OBSERVATION OF THE ACTIONS OF FINANCING OF THE DEPARTMENTS. THEY TAKE THEM PRETTY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE VOTERS DID APPROVE THE. SO SO FAR HAS BEEN A PROBABLY CAN'T SPEAK OF THE FUTURE BUT HISTORICALLY IT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. I'M I'M GONNA PAKSHA TO LEAVE HERE IN A LITTLE BIT BUT I WANTED TAKEN UP TO YOU TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THEM WILL GO TO MISTER WOOD. IF MISTER LEVINE MAYBE COULD TAKE OVER CHAIRMANSHIP THAT AFTER THIS. AT WORK OR MISTER. YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE. IN THIS BOND THAT MISTER MARROW. BY SUPPOSE THAT'S ALSO THE GREATEST. PROBLEM. WITH IT WITH YOUR BOND AS WELL RIGHT IS YOU KNOW SOME OF SOME OF DESCRIBED IT AS A CHRISTMAS TREE RIGHT THAT THERE'S. YOU KNOW A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS FOR ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SO PEOPLE CAN SAY WELL HEY THAT'S GREAT IT'S ADDRESSING ALL THE DIFFERENT. NEEDS THEY'RE OUT THERE BUT IN DOING SO WE HAVE A PRETTY BIG BOND HERE WE HAVE. YAMAHA NINE BILLION DOLLAR BOND. AFTER WE'VE JUST APPROVED A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND ON THE BALLOT. AND YOU KNOW HERE JUST RECENTLY. AT THE LA OUR REPORT. VERY CLEARLY LAYS OUT THE MORE PAIN ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT SERVICE JUST ON OUR AND NATURAL RESOURCES BONDS. THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND I GUESS. THE THING THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO A BONDS IS. REALLY WHAT THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT IS HELPING LOCALS. YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE LOCALS CAN. TOLLEY COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO DO VITAL PROJECTS THE BONDS HELP THEM DO THAT RIGHT. AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAYS WE'VE DONE THAT IS THROUGH PROPOSITION ONE KNEE AND LET LEVY BONDS. WHERE WE'VE? THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A. STRENGTHENED IN CERTAIN PLACES ARE ARE LEVEES LOCALS PROBABLY COULD COME UP THAT ALL THEY HAVE TAX THEMSELVES. AND. BUT IN ADDITION TO HAVING THE BOND SUPPORT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OVERALL. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK. PERHAPS IT THIS WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE FOCUSED IN ON ON JUST THAT. AND. THIS BAR MAYBE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS. AS LARGE IT IS AS IT HAS PROPOSED RIGHT NOW. AND I GUESS THE OTHER CONCERN. THAT WOULD LAY OUT IS. AND MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS. TO THINK ABOUT ISN'T THERE ARE PLACES IN THIS BOMB WHERE. I WILL COME SORT OF BAILOUTS AND. FOR STATE AGENCIES A. AND AND FOR TAKING CARE OF WHAT I REALLY STATE AGENCIES RESPONSIBILITIES. AND YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF HELPING. LOCALS MEET YOU KNOW SOME OF THEIR. NEEDS AND OBLIGATIONS RIGHT SO FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW WHERE'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND THEREFORE THE OROVILLE DAM REPAIRS. THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF. YOU KNOW MY KIDS MY GRAND CHILDREN. YEAR TO PAY OFF BY MONEY TO TAKE CARE THAT. ANOTHER ONE I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS PAIN. VW OURS AND THREE OTHER. AGENCIES. A CAP AND TRADE. A. ENERGY COSTS RIGHT THERE WERE ESSENTIALLY GONNA SUBSIDIZE WHAT THEIR PAIN. AND WHAT THE INCREASING COSTS OF THEIR PAIN BECAUSE A CAP AND TRADE FOR THREE. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WE DON'T DO THAT FOR. FRANCE'S A CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER WHO'S PICKING UP THAT IN THEIR ENERGY COSTS. AND AND SO MANY OTHER AREAS BUT WE'RE GONNA DO IT. FIRST SIMPSON BIG GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC. ABOUT THIS BOND NOW IT'S YOU KNOW MAYBE ASK YOU TO JUST ADDRESS. THOSE TWO AREAS OKAY WELL YOU KNOW IN IN THE IN THE CASE OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. PARA COULD QUOTE POGO AND SAY WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND HE IS US BECAUSE. MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE ACTUALLY GET WATER FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT OR YOUR GATE THEIR FIELDS OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO. A. IN THE CASE OF ORVILLE OF THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS PAID FOR THE FLOOD CONTROL ELEMENTS OF ORVILLE ORIGINALLY THAT NOT THE WATER CONTRACTORS AND THAT WAS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE FLOOD CONTROL IS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED GENERAL FUND. OBLIGATION AND AS I THE PAPER FIVEPERCENT READ OF THE TO A LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT WAS A LOT MORE THAN THAT BUT. WELL THEN IT WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT TODAY WOULD BE HUNT MANY HUNDREDS MISS NINE AT THAT TABLE WAS A NINETY EIGHT PERCENT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT. IN TERMS OF BENEFITS BUT I BELIEVE THE COR PAID MORE F THAT IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE IS A FRACTION OF THE COST I COULD I COULD GO BACK AND SEE WHAT I THINK IT WAS MORE THAN. BUT BUT IN THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS INEVITABLY ARE GOING TO PICK UP A LOT OF THE COST OF REPAIRING ORVILLE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEME IS GOING TO PAY AS MUCH AS THE STATE IS ASKED US TO PAY ASK THEM TO PAY. BUT THE FLOOD CONTROL BENEFITS ORVILLE ARE. I DON'T TO SAY HARMFUL BUT LET'S SAY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE WATER SUPPLY AILMENTS. SO WHEN YOU'RE LOWERING THE RESERVE WHERE FOR FLOOD CONTROL YOU REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE YOU CAN USE LATER ON. AND IF IT DOESN'T RAIN YOU PROBABLY CAN'T REFILL IT STIRRED SO YOU SACRIFICED WATER POWER BENEFITS REPORT CONTROL THAT'S A GOOD TRADE OFF THAT'S PUBLIC POLICY IT'S A GOOD THING. BUT IT'S DETRIMENTAL TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING WATER POWER FROM THE PROJECT. AND SO. BUT THE IDEA OF THE STATE PAYING SOME PROBABLY ONLY GET IN THE END TWENTY PERCENT OR LESS OF THE COST OF FIXING ORVILLE. BUT NOT ONLY OR. I THINK IT'S FAIR IN TERMS OF ITS GENERAL FUND BENEFITS THE FLOOD CONTROL BENEFITS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE AFTER ALL IN THE END MOST OF THE PEOPLE THE STATE ARE BENEFICIARIES OF STATE WATER PROJECT EVERYONE SOUTH THE TEHACHAPI IS IN MOST OF THE BAY AREA AND MOST OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY A LOT OF IT. SOUTHERN END OF IS A BENEFICIARY. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU GO EITHER WAY AND THAT AND I RESPECT THE IDEA THAT MAYBE THE CONTRACT YOU SHOULD PAY FOR ALL OF IT. BUT STILL A IT'S A PRETTY SMALL FRACTION AND PROBABLY NOT RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY FLOOD CONTROL WAS FUNDED ORIGINALLY I KNOW THAT ISN'T ANSWERED SATISFIES EVERYBODY BUT IT'S OUR RATIONALE FOR MATT WELL OF COURSE AND I THINK YOU KIND OF ALLUDED TO IT BUT. I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE DRIVEN HOME. THE THE THE COST OF HAVING A WATER SUPPLY PROJECT. YOU KNOW FOR THE STATE ALSO MEANS DOING WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE THAT. RIGHT LIVE DOWNSTREAM OF IT. NEW AND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE SAFE SHOULD BE DONE WELL PAT BROWN YOU KNOW I SIT AND THAT OR WILL BE BUILT BEFORE THE STATE WATER PROJECT PEOPLE SAID IT WAS NEEDED. IN FACT THEY WERE RIGHT THEY DIDN'T NEED OR BILL BUT HE FLEW OVER MARYSVILLE YUBA CITY AND FIVE AND SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN AND OF COURSE THAT WAS WONDERFUL AND THEN ORVILLE SERVE THAT FUNCTION SO. RATES A MONTH ACOSTA THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE BENEFICIARIES RIGHT AND SORT OF THROW PARTIES AND THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT LOCAL THAT'S WHERE IT IS. ARE GOING TO PAY FOR ARE GONNA PAY FOR THAT AND AND BON PAIRS. YOU KNOW THE GENERAL TAXPAYER SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT'S ON THE HOOK FOR THAT IT SHOULD BE THOSE WHO ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF THAT. WELL THAT'S IN A NO IF HE COULD AS THE CAP AND YOU KNOW WHY ARE WE SUBSIDIZING THE STATE'S CAP AND TRADE COSTS WERE NOT SUBSIDIZING. THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS I ACTUALLY THERE IS NO SUBSIDY IN THAT. SECTION OF THE BOND THE MONEY THAT IS PAID. IN ALLOWANCES BY THOSE AGENCIES THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRA COSTA ARTIST AND SO ON. BUT WILL STILL BE PAID THEY STILL HAVE TO PAY IT NOW INSTEAD OF IT GOING TO SORT OF A GENERAL CATIA THOSE FUNDS THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW IF IMPLY THE B. THIRTY TWO. AND THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT ON PROJECTS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS IF THE MONEY WAS SPENT OR ANY OTHER PROJECT. SO THEY'RE NOT JUST GETTING THE MONEY BACK THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT ON ENERGY WATER CONSERVATION TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND THAT HAS TO BE REVIEWED THAT WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE AIRPORT SO IT'S REALLY NOT. ANY KIND OF SUBSIDY AND THE MONEY WILL STILL BE SPENT FOR THE SAME ORIGINAL PURPOSES. TURN OF MISTER BLOOM AND THEN. CATHOLIC CONCRETE WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO SEQUESTER FOR YOU I'VE GOT IT I GOT A LIST HERE OF DONORS TO THIS INITIATIVE AND. AND. BOUT OF MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR MILLION TO MORE THAN FOUR ONE POINT TWO THIS IS I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DATE ON THIS IS BUT. SO I'M ALSO NOTICING THAT A LOT OF THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT. PRIVATE ENTITIES OUT THERE WHERE THEY WHERE THEY HOPE TO GAIN BY THE SEAS ARE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS RIGHT WE'VE ACTUALLY RAISE TWO POINT ONE MILLION SO FAR TYPE AND ONE THIRD OF THAT HAS COME FROM AGRICULTURE. ONE THIRD FROM PEOPLE I'D SAY ARE ALIGNED WITH WATER AGENCIES AND ONE THIRD FROM CONSERVATION GROUPS AND WE'RE HAPPY WITH THAT ACTUALLY I HOPE WE MAINTAIN THAT BALANCE. ARE SO IN THE CASE OF ALL I I DON'T WANT TO ALWAYS ATTRIBUTE. WHY PEOPLE GIVE BUT I'LL GIVE YOU MY BEST GUESS? THE CONSERVATION GROUPS SEE THE BENEFIT OF WATER SUPPLY FOR WATERFALL OF WATER FOR OTHER KINDS OF HABITAT OF HABITAT CONSERVATION WATERSHED RESTORATION. BY I WOULD SAY. THEY'RE DISPASSIONATE IN THE SENSE THAT ARE GOING TO GET MONEY OUT OF IT THEMSELVES BUT THEY JUST HAVE THAT AS A AS AN OVERALL GOAL. THE AGRICULTURAL PEOPLE I THINK RIGHTLY SEE THE THREAT TO CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE FROM. ARE DIMINISHING WATER SUPPLY IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH WATER WE'VE EXPORTED TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE YEARS IT'S GONE DOWN A LOT FOR A LOT OF REASONS YOU COULD LIST A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF REASONS AND AND. MANY DIVERSE REASONS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS ESPECIALLY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO HELP AGRICULTURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SERIOUS DECLINE IN THEIR CULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND SILICON VALLEY. THEN THIS FIXING OF THE FRANKLIN CANALS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. A DOES HAVE TO BE FIXED A LOT OF THE DONORS FROM THAT AREA NOT ALL. IN SO I THINK THEY'RE JUST FEELING THE THREAT OF THEIR WATER SUPPLY TO. THEIR FUTURE THEIR WHOLE FUTURE IN THE STATE THAT'S MY GUESS. THE WATER PEOPLE ARE REALLY DIVERSE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY A CONSTANTLY REMIND ME IN THEIR BIG DONORS TO THIS EVER CULTURAL GROUPS IN SEPARATE AVAIL. CONSTANTLY REMIND ME THAT. BY REPAIRING FISHERIES THEIR PRODUCTIVITY CAN BE SUSTAINED AND SO THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR NEW WATER FACILITIES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT NO STORAGE THEY SAID FIX THE FISH FIX THE CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER IN OUR REGION. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY I THINK IS MORE EFFORT TO FIX THE FRANK KERN CANAL SOME OF THE OTHER FACILITIES DOWN THERE SO IT'S PRETTY DIVERSE AND THAT'S PUBLIC GOOD THING. AS GLORIA. THANK YOU SHARON THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND IN A VERY. LUCID ANSWER STOOD TO THE QUESTIONS WE DON'T ALWAYS GET BETTER OUT OF SIGHT AYE HE SAID. OUT OF MY COLLEAGUES DON'T THAT'S EXCEPTIONAL JOB OF A GETTING TO. SOME OF THINGS I WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHO. GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE TWO MILLION BUCKS HAD IMAGINE THERE'S SOME INDICATION OF THE VOTERS. WILLINGNESS TO TO DO THIS I'M MIGHT. GENERAL TUITION I'M NEW IN THE LEGISLATURE SO I COULD BE WRONG. IS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME. FATIGUE WITH THIS AND THEY JUST APPROVED A VERY LARGE BOND IN THE ON YOU KNOW LAST WEEK I'M HERE. ANOTHER GROUP COMING TO THE TABLE ASKING AGAIN WHAT'S THE PUBLIC'S APPETITE FOR DOING THIS IT MAY BE IN NEED OF IT THERE'S ALWAYS A NEED THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THIS IS WATER SO YOU KNOW. IN CALIFORNIA BUT BUT WHAT IT WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED IN TERMS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS AGAIN SO SOON WE'VE HAD A TWENTY FOUR WATER BONDS ON THE CALIFORNIA BALLOT SINCE NINETEEN SIX. TWENTY THREE OF PASSED. AND HISTORICALLY. THEY OF THAT I GOT AN OFFER THAT BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU BY THE WAY. WE HISTORICALLY THERE BEEN CASES WHERE THERE WERE VERY FEW BANDS ON THE BALLOT OR VERY MANY BANDS ON THE BALLOT. NINE TIMES THERE BEEN MORE THAN ONE WATER BOND ON THE SAME BALLOT NOT JUST THE SAME YEAR BUT THE SAME BALLOT. ALL NINE OF THEM PASSED. I THINK THE EXPLANATION FOR THAT AND ALSO BY THE WAY THE MARGINS DURING DOG RECESSIONS VERSUS GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES DON'T CHANGE THAT MUCH IT'S AMAZING. I THINK PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA GENERALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WATER COMES FROM IF YOU GET IN UBER AND LEN ASK THEM THOSE SAY DWP YOU KNOW THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOUGH NO. BUT THEY KNOW THEY LIVE IN A DRY PLACE IT DOESN'T RAIN MUCH. AND THEY'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT WATER AND SO OUR POLLING SHOWS THAT WE'RE OVER SIXTY PERCENT NOW WITHOUT ANY CAMPAIGN. IN PROP YOU KNOW SIXTY EIGHT DID VERY WELL THAT FIFTY SIX PERCENT. SO WE'RE NOT TOO WORRIED ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE HISTORY OF NINE TIMES YOU'VE HAD MORE THAN ONE IN THE SAME BELT ONCE WE HAVE THREE WATER BOND ON THE SAME DAY OUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT THOSE ARE ALL LEGISLATIVE. THEY'LL PASSED. THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL HAS REMAINED ABSENCE OF THE SUCCESS IT'S JUST THE RAPT EXPRESSION WITHIN JUST A FEW MONTHS OTHER YOU EDUCATE ME IF THERE WAS. MULTIPLE ON SENATE STREET. THAT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF IT HE WAS GONNA BE A LINK THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT IN NEW WITHIN MY OWN COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION. THERE'S A RUN ON THE BANK IF YOU WILL. THAT'S HAPPENING SO IT'S PART OF WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE CRIED DATA THAT SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS OVER THE ENDEAVOR HOPE. THAT SUCH A CRIME THE CLINTON SIGNATURES THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE WELL WE'RE FINISHED WE DEFENSE OCCURS OF OUR. SO THERE'S NO POTENTIAL FOR AMENDING THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THERE IS A LAW THAT MISTER STEINBERG DID WHEN HE WAS HERE THAT SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD OFFER. ALTERNATIVES TO PROPONENTS OF INITIATIVES AND THAT THE PROPONENTS UP UNTIL JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH CAN WITHDRAW THEIR INITIATIVE AND DOES HAVE A SUBSTITUTE LEGISLATIVE MEASURE THAT HAS HAPPENED ONCE ACTUALLY BUT THERE'S NO DISCUSSIONS LIKE THAT VOTE TO NOT RIGHT NOW NO. AND I I GUESS PART OF WHY I ASK IS THAT SIR INFANTRY SUBCOMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY REYES I THINK ONE THAT CAUGHT MY EYE. IS. THE ABILITY TO ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COMPETE FOR SOME OF THESE FUNDS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE WISDOM BEHIND THAT PROVISIONS. THAT APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO THE SIERRA NEVADA CARBS ARE WATERSHED LITERALLY THE STATE'S WATERSHED IS THE SOONER THAT WE GET ALL OF OUR WATER FROM IT FOR WELL ALL BUT A VAST MAJORITY OF OUR WATER. AND MOST OF ITS OWN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY HAVE NEVER ALLOCATED THE FUNDS WE NEED TO RESTORE THOSE WATERSHEDS AND THIS YEAR NEVADA CONSERVANCY STRONGLY TOLD US THAT IF WE WANT TO. RESTORE THOSE FORESTS AND GET THE WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY WE NEED OF THOSE FORESTS. THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO INVEST WE DON'T HAVE TO INVEST NECESSARILY IN SIERRA PACIFIC INDUSTRIES LAND THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING A. BUT THESE FEDERAL LANDS ARE ORPHANS TO SOME EXTENT IN YOUR IT'S OUR WATER SUPPLY SO WE LISTEN TO THIS YEAR OF A CONSERVANCY IN THAT ISSUED ME THE. FOR THAT PROVISIONAL IMPLIES THE SIERRA NEVADA THAT'S THE ONLY WHEN WE COME. YES I SAID AT THE OWN WITH NO WE ALSO INCLUDE FUNDS FOR THE FRANKLIN CANNELLA REPAIR WHICH IS TECHNICALLY OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MANAGED BY THE LOCAL AGENCY. AND SO THAT WOULD APPLY THERE AS WELL. SO FORGIVE ME SO THERE'S TWO PLACES IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS NOTE WELL IN THAT CASE THE FOR THE LOCAL STATE AGENCY THE FRYER WATER AGENCY WOULD APPLY NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN FACT EVEN IN THE SIERRA NEVADA I'M SURE ALL THE FUNDS WOULD GO THROUGH STATE AGENCIES NOT THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT IT COULD BE SPENT ON FEDERAL LANDS THAT'S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE. AND IN THOSE THAT SECOND FINAL QUESTION MR OF. IS THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS PROVISION THAT SO ELIMINATED BY STAFF CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY THIS FROM THE STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER BONDS ACTUALLY THE ANALYST HAD A. STILL HERE BUT IN FACT THERE WAS ONE OTHER ONE A PROPOSITION TWO OH FOR BY SOMEONE CASA WHICH IS WATER BOND IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX. THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID APPROVE WITH CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION I IN ADDITION TO THE ONE THAT THAT THE ENLISTED MENTION OF PROPOSITION ONE A LARGE SHARE OF THAT. AND THEIR THE ANSWER REALLY WAS OF CONCERN WOULD BE PERFECTLY HONEST CONCERN BY PROPONENTS OF CHANGES IN THE ALLOCATIONS WHEN PEOPLE SUPPORT THESE BONDS THROUGH. CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MADE THEY WANT TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY THAT THEY'LL ACTUALLY GET WHAT THEY'RE OF INVESTING IN IN THE SENSE. AND SO THAT WAS THE REASON PLUS PREP TO FORGET A HUGE YES VOTE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND BY THE PUBLIC AND SO APPARENTLY THE PUBLIC WAS PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THAT PRECEDENT. YOU'RE SO IT LEGISLATURE MAY NOT BE A YES I DO. THEY CAN IS FROM MISTAKES IF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND FOR AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS. MARK ME MEMBERS AT THIS TIME ALASKA. THE. REPRESENTED FROM THE SIERRA CLUB. TO COME FORWARD. AND DATA DAVID WOLF. WHO? REPRESENTS THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AS WELL. I THINK YOU GOOD MORNING KYLE JONES THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND NOW WE DID TAKE IN OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BONDS. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WHICH ALL OF TRY TO HURRY IN GETTING THROUGH. ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS IS THE SIZE OF OF THE BOND ITSELF. YEAH AS WAS ALLUDED TO THE TOTAL DEBT SERVICING WOULD BE SOMEWHERE AROUND OVER SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. OP REPRESENTING A GENERAL FUND COST PRESSURE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AT AND I BELIEVE THIS PUTS DE RESOURCES AGENCIES BUDGET OF OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF IT WILL BE QUARTET SERVICES. AND THAT'S A HUGE HIT AND AND AND YOU KNOW AS THE GOVERNOR LIKES AWARENESS EVERY MAY. THAT YOU KNOW. BAD TIMES CAN COME AND THE GENERAL FUND IS WHAT TAKES THE HARDEST HIT DURING THOSE TIMES OUT WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT PROTECTING FUNDS FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION. YOU KNOW A FUTURE LEGISLATURE OR THIS ONE COULD BE FACED WITH HARD CHOICES ABOUT WHERE TO CUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN THIS OUT FROM THE RESOURCES BUDGET FOR OTHER NEEDY PROGRAMS. OR IS THAT FROM OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE RECENTLY WORKED HARD TO TO GET PAST I IT IT AND SO. THIS SIZE THE BOND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW RAISE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ARM. AND WE THINK THAT'S A PART OF THE REASON THE SIZES SO BIG IS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF GOING BONTA THROUGH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS RATHER THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I'M. MISTER GALLAGHER SAID THAT IF THE BONDS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE CHRISTMAS TREE. UP AND WE CAN AGREE I THINK THROUGH THE PROCESS. HERE IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US. AND THAT'S BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE AN APPROACH WHERE THOSE WHO CAN WHO WILL SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM THE BOND OF THOSE WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING THE BOND TOO AND THOSE WERE ASKING FOR MORE ITEMS FOR THE BOND. IT'S NOT AN OPEN PROCESS FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS LIKE A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS PROBLEM. I'M SURE CHAIR GARCIA YOU STILL HAVE SCARS FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND AND AND ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS I HAD TO GO THROUGH FOR THAT BUT. ULTIMATELY GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS IS BETTER FOR THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IS HAS A A BETTER SEAT AT THE TABLE. BOB AND AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THIS PROCESS WE SEE THAT FUND THAT THAT ITEMS ARE GETTING FUNDED IN THIS BOND. THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR BOND FUNDING IN OUR VIEW AYE. BONDS ARE GREAT FOR AS MENTIONED OUT WHERE LOCALS CAN'T OR MAYBE WON'T BE AS WILLING TO PAY OR WHERE WE'RE PUSHING. AS PUBLIC POLICY. YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE WATER RECYCLING WHERE IT'S MAYBE NOT AS EASY TO GET PEOPLE ON BOARD FOR A RATE INCREASE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THERE'S THINGS LIKE KLAMATH RIVER. US DON'T SEE RESTORATION WHERE THE TAXPAYERS ARE ALREADY IN HOCK. INSTEAD WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS AS ⰭHINK HERE. THINGS LIKE ORVILLE WHERE THERE ARE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THAT FUNDING OR THE FRANK CURRENT CAN NOW WHERE THERE ARE. EITHER BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE THOSE RECEIVE THE PROJECTS OR THEORETICALLY YOU COULD HOLDS OUT THOSE WHO DAMAGE THE CAN DOWN THE FIRST PLACE THROUGH OVER PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER. AT FAULT I'M INSTEAD THAT'S THAT'S GETTING PUSHED ON THE TAXPAYER AND AND TO THE EXTENT THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THINGS ABOUT. STOP. WHERE WHERE WE SHIFT THE POLICY ON THOSE AND WHERE? WE THINK ABOUT OR BILL AND AND WHAT ROLE THE FLOOD CONTROL ABOUT FLOOD CONTROL BENEFIT IT PROVIDES A THAT IS BEST DONE I THINK THROUGH DELIBERATE OF PUBLIC POLICY PROCESS RATHER THAN A INITIATIVE PROCESS FOR AVANT. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT ALL OF THESE ITEMS ARE ALL CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED AND THERE'S NO FUTURE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY GIVING AWAY LARGE AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER MONEY AND AND WE AYE I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT WILL BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN. S. AND IT WITHOUT. BUT THEN I JUST KINDOF WANTED TO ENDS WITH A DISCUSSION AROUND THE TEACHER A FUNDING AT THE MOMENT. AS WAS MENTIONED BY AGENCIES WHO PAY INTO THE G. GIRAFFE WILL GET THAT MONEY BACK. FORWATER CONSERVATION PROJECTS AND OF. I GUESS ONE THING IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME ON THAT IS IS HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE OTHER SIXTY PERCENT OF THE GDR UP THAT'S ALREADY BEEN CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SUCH AS HIGH SPEED RAIL. ARE ARE THEY STILL PAYING INTO THAT PORTION OR DOES THAT MEAN EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY IS NOW. INCREASING THEIR SHARE OF COSTS INTO THOSE PROGRAMS. AND SECONDLY. THE G. GIRAFFE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON EFFICIENT CLIMATE REDUCTIONS WATER CONSERVATION CAN SAVE ENERGY AND CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFICIENT QUICKEST WAY TO GET THAT DONE. OUT WE ARE FACING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS OF OUR TIME AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT. IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE. AND ENDS YOU KNOW TURF REPLACEMENT CAN. YOU KNOW SOUTH ATTACHED PIECE CAN SAVE SOME ENERGY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PUMPING THAT MUCH WATER OVER THERE BUT. THAT SHOULDN'T COME AT THE EXPENSE OF ELECTRIFYING FREIGHT FLEETS IN THE SOUTH COAST THAT IS YOU KNOW PRODUCING A LARGE AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS AND ALSO IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND SAVING LIVES. SO LOCKING THAT FUNDING AWAY. FROM ANY CONTROL FOR THE LEGISLATURE IT IS PROBLEMATIC AND UP FOR THOSE REASONS AND THERE'S MORE BUT MORE DOWN IN THE WEEDS I DON'T WANNA PARTY WHICH DAY. WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING DAVID WILL FILE WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION MEDIA APPRECIATE THE INVITATION FROM THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING. TO SPEAK ON THIS BOND ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT I DO WANT TO STRESS FROM THE OUTSET THAT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION HAS NO OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BOND AT THIS TIME. ITEM AND YOU KNOW WE'VE MERELY BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE SORT OF. OUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE VIEW ON TERM DEBT AND DECISIONS ON THIS BOND SAID THAT BASICALLY MEANS I GET TO NERD OUT ON FISCAL STUFF FOR A FEW MINUTES AND. HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO DO THAT I WANT TO KNOW FROM THE OUTSET MISTER CHAIRMAN PITT HHA IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY OPPOSED TO ALL STATE GEO BONDS. WE DID TAKE A NEUTRAL POSITION ON PROP ONE A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BOND FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN IN WHICH SHALL ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THAT MONEY DID GO. TO. INCREASED WATER STORAGE WATER CAPACITY PROJECTS LIKE SITES AND TEMPERANCE FLATS. THE CONCERNS AND I WOULD STRESS THEY ARE JUST CONCERNS AT THIS POINT THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THIS BOND IS THAT IT'S BIGGER THAN PROP ONE WITH LESS OF PERCENTAGE OF THOSE FUNDS. GOING TO VARIOUS WATER STORAGE PROJECTS. MISTER CHAIRMAN DON'T MISUNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY. WASTE WATER RECYCLING DE SALLE PROJECTS DO YOU ADD ROLE WATER AND WE DO THINK THERE'S VALUE TO THOSE PROJECTS BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO ASK BED. IF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. THE PROJECTS TO LIE STILL AND FOR THE BOND WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A CRIER YOU KNOW IS A PRIORITY. FOR BOND PROJECTS. DO YOU DESALINATED STORAGE PROJECTS DO THEY LOST UNDER THE BOND PERHAPS BUT ARE THEY THE BEST USE OF THOSE BOND DOLLARS. AND COULD EXPANDING RESERVOIRS AND BUILDING DAMS AND EVEN ADDING UNDERGROUND STORAGE AQUIFER RECHARGE TYPE PROJECTS OF THAT BE A BETTER USE OF BOND DOLLARS. FOR THE BUCK AND I THINK. YOU KNOW DOES NEED TO BE LOOKED INTO AND YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY I THINK AS WAS MENTIONED WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A BOND. THAT GOES THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE YOU POTENTIALLY DO RUN THE RISK OF THOSE PROBLEMS OCCURRING AND I THINK A. YOU KNOW WE AGREE WITH THAT ON SOME LEVEL. JUST TO CONTINUE AND YOU HAVE. THIS CHAIR CALLED ALREADY TALKED ABOUT SORT OF THE ISSUE WITH ON GOING THAT OUR DEBT SERVICE RATIO RIGHT NOW DOMINATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S PAID OUT A GENERAL FUND SOLELY TO PAY OFF BOND THAT. IS ABOUT FIVE PERCENT AND IT CAN BE DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT THAT NUMBER IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW. AND THERE'S EVEN DEBATES ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW IN MY OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK THE FACT REMAINS IN THE QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK IS THERE'S NO PRIORITY OF BOND AT. YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE WALL A DAT ANY ISSUES WITH THAT IN THE STATE AND YOU KNOW AS HE TERMS OUT I THINK WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE A PULLBACK FROM THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE PROP FIFTY ONE. ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS SCHOOL BOND. THERE'S A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND ON THIS BALLOT IN ADDITION TO THE WATER BOND. AND. AND I THINK BEG THE QUESTION OF PRIORITIZING THIS DEBT GOING FORWARD IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT. FOR EXAMPLE IS WATER MORE IMPORTANT HIGH SPEED RAIL. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE ADDRESSING. AND THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE USE I THINK OF EXPENDITURES IN A WATER BOND I THINK. THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ASPECTS BOTH OF THIS BOND AS WELL AS PROP SIXTY EIGHT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW TODAY COULD YOU LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND THAT IS IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW BOND FUNDS SHOULD BE USED AND YOU KNOW WHERE CERTAINLY IN AGREEMENT WITH AWKWARDNESS TALK ON THAT PLANE. BOND FUNDS SHOULD BE USED TO HELP PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER THAT'S A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF THIS BUDGET OF THIS BOND. AND. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT PRIORITIZATION OF BUYING THAT. AND MEMBERS FINALLY THE YEAH. THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE. IS. THE ASPECT OF MONEY FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WATER PROJECT. THAT'S NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF THIS BOND AND I THINK THE QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE AUSTIN AND POSED. YOU KNOW MUCH OF MISTER GALLAGHER KIND OF DEAD. IS IS THIS MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN AND SHOULD BE FUNDED BY STATE BOND OR DIRECTLY BY. WATER AGENCY REPAIRS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW AGAN FARMERS AND INDIVIDUALS DOWN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. YOU KNOW SHOULD PROBABLY BE TARGETED TO PAY FOR THAT MORE THAN STATE TAXPAYERS GENERALLY. AND MINISTER GALLAGHER BROUGHT THAT UP WITH THE OROVILLE DAM AND I THINK THAT SAME THING WITH ROUGHLY PI. TO YUBA IN OF CENTRAL VALLEY WATER PROJECT AS WELL. SO AND THERE'S A FEW THOUGHTS THAT WE HAVE A BE HAPPENING TEN QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. OR. AND NO QUESTIONS APPRECIATE THAT BOTH OF YOU FOR COMING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON THIS INITIATIVE. ON BEHALF OF UP YOU KNOW CHAIRMAN PLUMAS WELL THANK YOU. YEAH. WE ARE AT THIS TIME WILL TAKE A PUBLIC COMMENTS IF ANYONE WANTS TO. JUST MAKE STATEMENT. ON THE RECORD ON THE INITIATIVE. SEEN AND NO ONE AND I THINK YOU CAN ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US FOR. THIS JOINT HEARING AT THIS TIME WE WILL ADJOURN
