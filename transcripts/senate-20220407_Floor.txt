SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION ELEVEN BY SENATOR SKINNER RELATIVE TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED ACT A SACRED TRUST. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING RESOLUTION S. J. R. ELEVEN WHICH- ASKS CONGRESS TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S FUNDING IS STABILIZED. NOW BEYOND RETIREES AND I THINK ALL OF US APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW AT A CERTAIN AGE YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING INTO IT. SOCIAL SECURITY IS A KEY SOURCE OF INCOME FOR VETERANS FOR PEOPLE WHOSE SPOUSE MAY HAVE DECEASED. CHILDREN AND THOSE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES. CRUCIALLY SOCIAL SECURITY SURVIVOR BENEFITS PROVIDE INCOME FOR MANY CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS DIED FROM CARBON. NOW THE CURRENT FISCAL HEALTH OF OUR SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED THE- EITHER THE- EXPECTING WHAT IS PROVIDED IF YOU ARE A BENEFICIARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY OR- THE SOURCE OF FUNDING. THAT CONTRIBUTES TO IT. AND GOODS PROJECTED THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY FOR. THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM WILL FACE A 20% SHORTFALL NOW MANY OF US HERE ON THIS FLOOR NOT HAVING PENSIONS. MAY LIKE MANY MANY MANY MANY AMERICANS RELY ON SOCIAL SECURITY IS OUR SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME WHEN WE RETIRE. AND MANY OF US WILL BE AT THAT RETIRING AGE AROUND TWENTY THIRTY FOUR. DO WE WANT TO HAVE 20% OF WHATEVER IS PROJECTED TO BE COMING IN OUR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK TO NOT BE THERE. AS CHAIR ELEVEN CALLS ON CONGRESS TO PASS HOUSE RESOLUTION FIVE SEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD UPDATE AND EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. AND ALLOW FOR THOSE WAGE EARNERS WHO GET INCOMES OF ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND THAT'S AN INDIVIDUAL WAGE EARNER. TO CONTRIBUTE INTO SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S CAPPED AT THAT AMOUNT. AND IF IT WERE OPEN TO THERE THEN WE WOULD DEAL WITH THE SHORTFALL SO IT COULD STABILIZE ITS FUNDING AND- WITH THAT ASPIRO VOTE. THANK YOU MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER DOLLING. THANK YOU ADAM TERMS I JUST READ RISE TO A COMMENT ABOUT. YOU KNOW SO SECURITY IN THOSE ARE ON FIXED INCOMES IN THOSE WAGE EARNERS THAT ARE- HOURLY WAGE EARNERS THE REAL BURDEN ON THOSE FOLKS TODAY IS THE INFLATION WHICH IS RISING AT IN SOME CASES 7% A MONTH. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP THOSE FOLKS ARE ON THOSE FIXED INCOMES AN HOURLY WAGES WE NEED TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF LIVING HOUSING THE COST OF ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE WE'VE SPENT ALMOST 60% MORE ON ENERGY WE ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST TAX RATE ON FUEL- AND FOR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS THOSE THOSE WILL IMPACT THESE. UP PEOPLE QUICKER IN IF IN A FASTER MANNER THAN GOING TO THE PROCESS OF GETTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO ANYTHING ON SOCIAL SECURITY OR THE LIKE SO I JUST WANT TO RISE AND SAY LOOK IF WE REALLY IS CALIFORNIANS WANT TO HELP- THESE FOLKS IN OUR STATE WE NEED TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF LIVING. IMMEDIATELY THIRTY LEYVA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I JUST WANT TO STAND IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF S. G. R. ELEVEN IT WAS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT YOU DIDN'T PAY INTO SOCIAL SECURITY ON EVERY DOLLAR THAT YOU EARNED AND IT'S JUST OUTRAGEOUS IMAGINE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT MAKE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THE PAY INTO IT EVERY MONTH WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY HIT THAT CAP DEPEND ON HOW MUCH YOU MAKE IT COULD BE JUNE JULY COULD BE DECEMBER THEN THEY GET MORE MONEY IN THEIR PAYCHECK BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING. TAKEN OUT THIS IS SUCH AN EASY FIX TO MAKE SURE THAT SOCIAL SECURITY IS WELL FUNDED IF WE DID THIS I READ AN ARTICLE WHILE BACK IF WE DID THIS WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO INCREASE WHAT OUR SENIORS GET WE CAN INCREASE SOCIAL SECURITY THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE HARD IN THE LEGISLATURE IN CONGRESS THIS IS EASY AND IT WILL HELP OUR EOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN POVERTY THE MOST WHICH IS OUR SENIORS SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT- AS YOUR ELEVEN AND I HOPE THAT WHEN THEY GET IT. SENATORS KINNER THEY WILL TAKE NOTE AND DO THE RIGHT THING THANK YOU MEMBERS.
