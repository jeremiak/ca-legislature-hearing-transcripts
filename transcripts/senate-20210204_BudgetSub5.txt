THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS TO WORKERS RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS TO CREATING GOOD JOBS TO REMOVING BARRIERS TO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD AND POSITIONING OUR STATE TO BE A LEADER AND PRESIDENT BY HIS PLAN TO BUILD BACK BETTER I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE RENEWED PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. TO PRIORITIZE THE SHIFT AWAY FROM JOBS AND HARM OUR COMMUNITIES AND TOWARD BUILDING A MODERN RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND A CLEAN FUTURE THEY'LL CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WHILE ALSO ADVANCING RACIAL EQUITY I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO ALIGN OUR PRIORITIES WITH AN EYE TOWARD REIMAGINING OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ADDRESSING RACIAL DISPARITIES WE MUST ENSURE ACHIEVEMENT OF SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM COST SAVINGS FROM INMATE POPULATION REDUCTIONS WHILE RETAINING ROBUST REHABILITATIVE. AND RESTORATIVE PROGRAMMING. RISEN PROGRAMMING SHOULD BE TIED TO OPPORTUNITIES POST INCARCERATION. A GOOD MODEL IS THE MULTI CRAFT CORE CURRICULUM MC THREE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.

ETCETERA COMMITTEE WITH HOLDING ACTION UNTIL THE MAY REVISION WHEN THEY SHOULD BE GREATER CLARITY ON. THE NEED FOR THIS FUNDING. THANK YOU. OKAY I NOW WILL GO OUR- COMMITTEE OF- I HAVE A- THE- A THE CDC ARE PER OF OUR THERE IN. PARTS OF THIS ANTICIPATED SPENDING AMOUNT THAT WILL BE COVERED BY FEDERAL FUNDING AND HOW MUCH IS THAT. WHO ONE ALISON HEWITT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE ARE NOT ABLE AT THIS TIME TO SHARE ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE IS THAT THE- STATE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDING WHEREVER POSSIBLE THERE'S TWO POTENTIAL VEHICLES FOR THAT THERE IS. AND THE CURRENT RARE EXCUSE ME CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS- WHICH IS KIND OF DIRECT FEDERAL PAYMENTS TO THE STATE AS WELL AS POTENTIAL REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY OR FEMA AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO SHARE ANY INFORMATION AT THIS TIME JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE LOOKING INTO ALL AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES. ANIMAL HOPE TO SHARE MORE INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. YOU CAN CHAIR BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE IT OR SOME OF THE RESULT WE DON'T KNOW THAT WE AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMITMENT. FROM THE- GOVERNMENT OR FEMA AND AS IT RELATES TO ANY SPECIFIC AMOUNT I WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE. FOR THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED FOR BUDGET YEAR- WOOD. AND THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AS WELL IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THAT. WE WILL NOW. I'M ITS INFORMATION IS KIND OF BEEN GATHERED IN REAL TIME AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDING REGULAR FISCAL UPDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE AND INTENDS TO CONTINUE DOING SO- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THOSE FISCAL UPDATES WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE PRECISE INFORMATION. OKAY AND THEN WHAT THE BSE C. PORTION- CAN YOU EXPLAIN A BIT MORE ON ON THE TWELVE MILLION HOW YOU DETERMINED THAT- AMOUNT. THAT WAS NEEDED THAT YOU SEE IS NEEDED- ABSOLUTELY JUST MADE AMENDED PARTMINER FINANCED WHEN WE WERE DETERMINED THAT TWELVE MILLION- WHAT WE LOOKED AT AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE DEVELOPING THE BUDGET WATER. RELEASES FROM CDC ARE ON TO P. R. C. S. DO YOU RECALL THE NINETEEN- FOR THE PERIOD OF OCTOBER A LITTLE BIT OF OCTOBER AND THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER I'M THERE HAD BEEN AN INITIAL KIND OF BUBBLE IN THE EARLY MONTHS IN APRIL AND JULY AND SO AFTER THAT THINGS STARTED TO LEVEL OUT WE EXTRAPOLATED. THAT THE LOWER NUMBERS OF RELEASES IN THE LATER MONTHS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER- AND MULTIPLY THAT BY ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOR THAT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE BUDGET YEAR TO DETERMINE THAT IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWELVE POINT ONE MILLION. TO PROVIDE FOR THE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED- INDIVIDUALS WE ARE ESTIMATING. TO BE RELEASED ON THE RCS. AND WHAT WHAT IS- WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF USES THAT YOUR- THIS MONEY WILL GO TO. THIS FUNDING IS USED TO SUPPORT PROBATION DEPARTMENTS AS THEY TAKE THESE ADDITIONAL CASELOAD MEMBERS ON- IT CAN BE USED FOR THINGS LIKE. HAVING LOWER NUMBERS OF CASELOAD SAID THE PROBATION OFFICERS ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT ME INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR CASELOAD- PROBATION APARTMENTS ALSO UTILIZED CONTRACTORS AND- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PROBATIONERS- SO IT'S REALLY UP TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES ON HOW THEY SPEND THOSE FUNDS. OKAY- THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES AND YES GO AHEAD SENATOR. COULD THANK YOU MA'AM SURE OF THE QUESTION IT I JUST WANT TO ESCALATE I THINK YOU WERE ALLUDING TO THE NOTION OF- WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT POSSIBLE FEDERAL BACKFILL SOONER RATHER THAN LATER SO. AT LEAST AT THIS COMMUNITY LEVEL I WOULD CHIME IN TO SUPPORT SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S LISTED AS GENERAL FUND. AT THIS POINT IN OBVIOUSLY. SO WE'RE GOING BE MAKING OTHER COMPETING GENERAL FUND. THE DECISION IS COMING ALONG- ON THIS ISSUE WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT TURN SUPPOSED TO CURSE RATIONS A SUPPORT TO THE COUNTIES- THROUGH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S I HEARD ALL THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION. IN THE PRESENTATION ABOUT- IT MAY HAPPEN IT MAY NOT HAPPEN- YOU'LL SEE IN TERMS OF HOW MANY FOLKS A RELEASE IS IT GONNA BE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED OTHER NUMBER I DIDN'T EAR A LOT OF DISCUSSION OPEN THE PRESENTATION ABOUT. HELLO THE DOLLARS PER CAPITA WERE CALCULATED- IT WORKED WAS THAT ON THE BASIS OF. SOME KIND OF A METRIC- IN TERMS OF WHAT COUNTIES- BUT YOU KNOW OUR SPENDING NOW I MENTIONED THAT WOULD BE A MOVING TARGET- I KNOWN IN THE COUNTY THAT. COULD I REPRESENT IS AB ONE OH NINE RE ENTRY CENTER WHICH WOULD BE THE LIKELY PLACE FOR THOSE DOLLARS TO GO- BASED ON A LOCAL DECISION- BUT I HAVE NO IDEA. WHAT THEY WOULD SAY HI THERE COST. A PROPERLY WOULD BE YOU KNOW AND WHETHER THAT ALIGNS WITH HOME WITH HIS CELL CATION I CAN JUST GENERALLY. COMMERCIAL TELEGRAPH MALCOLM GOING TO BE KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS. METRICS ON. A DOLLARS DOLLARS IN DOLLARS OUT- SO HAS THAT. BUT YOU KNOW ARE WE WINNING YET OR EVEN HOW WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND FIGURED OUT. WHAT THE REALLY SPENDING- CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF REENTRY PROGRAMS. THANK YOU. WHO AND I THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE QUESTION AT THIS POINT OKAY JUST A MOMENT APARTMENT OF FINANCE YES YOUR QUESTION HIGHLIGHTS A VERY GOOD QUESTION RIGHT NOW WE UTILIZED AN EDP FOR AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION RATE OF TEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER- INDIVIDUAL RELEASED ON HERE YES IN THIS THIS SEEMS IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS- STAY ON YES BUT WE DON'T HAVE A BREAK DOWN SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES IT'S JUST THAT- RELEASE. COST THANK YOU AND OBVIOUSLY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THIS MORE. THE IN THE FUTURE IT WOULD BE GOOD IN IT MAYBE THAT'S- A REQUEST TO THE ALEJO'S OFFICE IF AT SOME POINT- WE CAN GET. NOT GRANULAR PURCHASED ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY- YOU KNOW REPORT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR ACTUAL EXPERIENCES IN TERMS OF PER INDIVIDUAL COSTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURA TOWING OKAY GOOD. OKAY THANK YOU- SENATE CRITICIZING. ANYONE IS THIS CHOI I'M NOT OWNERS INSURANCE ON THE- THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME IS TO GRADUATE I DO A QUESTION BACK IN- IN PRISON EDUCATION FOR INCARCERATED. STUDENTS THIS IS A PROPER NOW'S REALLY REMOTE. THERE THERE ARE WAY TOO. YEAH. OKAY THE FIFTY OKAY GREAT OF. OKAY THE SERVER FROM IS HOLD HOLD OPEN SO WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT- ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER TWO- IS ON THE COVER NINETEEN WORKERS COMPENSATION AT CDC ARE. WE HAVE- WE HAVE FROM CDCR THEY'LL MAKE THE PRESENTATION. THIS YEAR IS. THIS IS ERIC SWANSON YES MISTER SWANSON START YOUR- THERE YOU GO OKAY- THANK YOU YOU SHOULD CHU IS A REQUEST FOR FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND THE MOUSE OUTLINED IN YOUR GENDER FOR FUTURE YEARS AND TWENTY SEVEN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO COMPLY WITH SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE. THIS BILL THAT PASSED LAST SESSION RESTORE A BOTTLE PRESUMPTION THAT AN EMPLOYEE'S ILLNESS OR DEATH RESULTING FROM CORPORATE BANKS YOU KNOW ROSE OUT OF THE COURSE OF APPOINTMENT. FOR THE PURPOSES OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. WITH ME TODAY IS JANELLE BROWN WHO'S A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS AND JOANNA SPIEGEL. WHOSE HIEF OF OUR EMPLOYMENT DISABILITY MANAGEMENT SECTION WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. SO IT. THAT'S A THREE YEAR FOR THE PRESENTATION. OKAY SO- DELEO YEAH THAT'S IT FOR NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. OKAY NO FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. LENITION MATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM OKAY. AND ALEJO. THIS TIME BUT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE QUESTIONS YEAH. OKAY I HAVE A OF A FEW QUESTIONS HERE- CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW BECAUSE OF OUR S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY NINE THAT CHANGES THE TYPICAL PROCESSES THAT THE CDC ARE USE USES TO. PROCESS WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. YES THIS IS JANELLE BROWN FROM CDC ARE AND THE WAY THAT THIS- SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE INCREASES OUR WORKLOAD BECAUSE THERE'S A SHORTENED TIME FRAME FOR MAKING A LIABILITY DECISION. GENERALLY WITH WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS THE AVERAGE OF DENIAL OR A LIABILITY DECISION MUST BE MADE WITHIN NINETY DAYS BUT IN THIS CASE ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATION WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO ACCEPT OR DENY LIABILITY AND SO BECAUSE OF THE COOK NINETEEN ARE QUESTIONS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO ASK. IT TAKES US A LOT LONGER TO DO BACKGROUND QUESTIONS AND WE NEED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST WITH THOSE COOLEY NINETEEN RELATED CLAIMS. SO THE REQUESTED AMOUNT IS TO INCREASE STAFF. YES THERE'S PERSONAL THERE'S- CLAIMS PROCESSING FEES MAINTENANCE FEES FOR THE ONGOING PROCESSING THERE ARE ACTUAL WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS FOR MEDICAL COSTS- PERMITTED DISABILITY AND OTHER ASSOCIATED- COSTS. OKAY I'M I'M FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- HOW DID YOU DETERMINE THIS BUDGETED AMOUNT AND WHY IS THE- BUDGETED AMOUNT FOR THREE YEARS. SO. AS AN ASIDE THE BULK OF THIS REQUEST IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORKERS COMP COSTS AND MOSTLY MEDICAL COSTS LEGAL SETTLEMENTS- LEE AT DISABILITY OR LEGAL COSTS AND DEATH BENEFITS AS WELL SO THERE ARE BASED ON DATA THAT OF ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF WORKERS COMP CLAIMS THAT WOULD BE FILED EACH YEAR AND THEY LOOKED AT ME MINOR MODERATE AND SEVERE CASES- TO COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE FOR WHAT THOSE COSTS WOULD ULTIMATELY BE YEAR OVER YEAR AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY SEVEN POSSESSIONS. SO THE REASON THAT THIS IS A MULTI YEAR PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE THEIR NEW CLAIMS THAT WILL BE FILED EACH YEAR- ONCE. EVEN AFTER A CLAIM IS FILED THEIR DISABILITY PAYMENTS THAT WILL OCCUR IN ADDITION IT. AND AN EMPLOYEE NEEDS TO GET TO THEIR MAXIMUM MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT BEFORE LEGAL SETTLEMENT OCCURS WHICH CAN TAKE UP TO THREE AND A HALF YEARS SO IT'S A LENGTHY PROCESS. SO THERE WILL BE EXPENDITURES YEAR OVER YEAR BUT IT IS IT A TEMPORARY FUNDING. AND ALL DEFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT- IF THEY'D LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. OKAY I MEAN I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU MEAN WE JUST STARTED GOING THROUGH THIS. IT'S A BRAND NEW FOR ALL FOR ALL OF US- HOW DO YOU. HOW DID YOU DETERMINE THE AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR- EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT MORE. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE IMPACT WE DON'T KNOW FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE OF WILL WE DON'T HAVE ANY PRIOR HISTORY ALL WITH THIS. SO HOW DO YOU COME UP HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE PLEASE. I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS JANELLE BROWN FROM CITY SIR WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD SIX MONTHS OF DATA- BETWEEN MARCH NINETEENTH WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S. EXECUTIVE ORDER ORIGINALLY. OUTLINED THE COLLUDED- COVERAGE. AND FROM THAT TIME WHEN THE VCP WAS PREPARED ABOUT SIX MONTHS OF DATA WAS RECEIVED BY US AND STATE FUNDS SO WE USE THAT DATA TO EXTRAPOLATE- THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT WE BELIEVE WE WOULD SEE WITHIN THE UP COMING YEAR OR TWO YEARS- THAT IS COVERED BY THE STATUTE. AND THEN BECAUSE THE NORMAL AVERAGE CLAIM LAST APPROXIMATELY THREE AND A HALF YEARS WE HAD TO BUILDING SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEARS EVEN THOUGH- THE STATUTE EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE NEEDED SOME FISCAL. FUNDING FOR THOSE SETTLEMENTS THAT COME AFTER THE STATUTE EXPIRES BUT BEFORE THE CLAIMS HAVE ALL THAT KßT AND THE SETTLEMENTS ARE NOT. OKAY THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS. YES SENATE CRITICIZING THE MINIATURE. THE SO I JUST WANT TO GO BACK IN AND UNDERSTAND A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY. THEY IT ALONG THE SAME LINE OF QUESTION I GUESS IS- THE COMPANY SHOULD BE IMPACTED SOME LIKE. DURING THE PRESENTATION WHAT WAS SAID WAS- IN THE FACTORIES IN THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES ARE ARE NEEDED IS BECAUSE- OF THE TIMELINE THE THIRTY DAY TIMELINE- IN AN EMPTY I'M TRYING TO DISTINGUISH HOW THAT CREATES. MORE THE NEED FOR MORE POSITIONS RELATIVE TO ACTUAL CASELOAD. ISN'T IT CAN YOU CAN YOU. KIND OF SEPARATE THOSE THINK THOSE TWO THINGS UP FOR US A LITTLE BIT HOW MUCH MORE CASE WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING A YOU TALKED ABOUT EXTRAPOLATING AND PROJECTING. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THE NEED FOR LONG TERM SUPPORT IS ONLY RELATED TO THE INCREASING CASELOAD. A SHORT TERM SUPPORT WOULD. WOULD CERTAINLY BE NEEDED TO SOME DEGREE- TO MAKE SURE THAT. OF THE THIRTY DAY TURNAROUND IS HAPPENING BUT I'M I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH THE NEED FOR A LONG LONG TERM SUPPORT. CRITICALLY WITH CODE CLAIMS WHICH- THE. YOU KNOW WOULD SEEM TO BE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THE- ANALYSIS MEDICAL ANALYSIS AND SO FORTH BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION I'M JUST TRYING TO THE DISTRICT AT THIS POINT IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- HOW MUCH LONG TERM IMPACT. IN TERMS A CASELOAD YOU'RE REALLY EXPECTING. YES SENATOR DECISIONAL BROWN FROM CDC ARE I WOULD SAY THAT- WITH REGARD TO THE INCREASED WORKLOAD RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SEEN A 20% INCREASE IN WORKLOAD WITH THE RETURN TO WORK WITH METERS WHO ARE THE PEOPLE AT THE INSTITUTION RECEIVED THE INITIAL CLAIMS. AND BEGAN COLLECTING THE DATA AND PROCESSING THOSE CLAIMS AND FORWARDING THE INFORMATION SINCE THEY ARE. ALSO PROCESS IS THIS FAITH AND SO WITH THE ADDITIONAL 20% INCREASING HE SAYS JUST BROKE OPEN OUR RETURN OR CREATORS ALREADY. THEIR JOBS ARE ASSIGNED AND HE'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND DISTINCT CREASES THOSE DUTIES AND THAT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD IS MEANT TO HELP OFFSET. THE STRAIN ON THOSE ROUTES I RETURN TO WORK READERS WE'RE DEALING WITH THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES AS WELL AS THEIR PER AGAIN SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AREN'T COLLECTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO HEADQUARTERS EMPLOYEES AND DOES NEED TO BE IN POSITIONS CREATED JUST TO ASSIST WITH THE CODE- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND PROCESSING OF THOSE PARTICULAR CLAIMS. THAT'S A THAT'S ON TOP OF THE ORIGINAL WORK ON THAT WE ARE HE ADDS AND THAT'S WHY THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. HAVE BEEN REQUESTED. THE TO THE OF. I WASN'T WHEN FIFTEEN WAS A DOG BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT FOR TO POINT IS THAT. IT MORE TO DO WITH REBEL PRINCE OF SPEEDING UP PROCESS. WHAT WOULD CLAY. PLEASE CALL CLAIMS TWENTY PER INCREASE OLD OF. REGARDLESS WHETHER OR NOT LOOKING FIFTY NINE HAD BECOME LAW. AND IT IS FREE OKAY. YES TO A DEGREE THAT CALL THE CLAIMS MAY HAVE HAPPENED- BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE EMPLOYER ON CBC ARTS YOU'LL- FIND INFORMATION ON SUCH AS IF THEY WERE EXPOSED OUTSIDE OF WORK. OR IF THE FAMILY MEMBER YOU KNOW MAY HAVE ACTUALLY AND THEY ARE. WE'RE SICK BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC FAMILY. YOU KNOW ASSETS TO A WORKER CONDITION AND SO THE ROBOT PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE PARTY ON THE- ON CD YOU. COME UP WITH ANY. AND AGAIN THAT'S INVESTING AND THAT UT IT'S NAY TO BE DONE WITHIN READING EIGHT WHAT SPEEDS UP THE- EVEN MORE AND WHICH WORKING. ARE AVAILABLE TO DO THAT AND THEM MAKE THOSE. IT'S A BURDEN FOR THE BARK AND SO I MEAN YOU TO STOP FIRST. AT THIS IS A- ONCE AGAIN FROM. ARE TOO I JUST WANTED TO. APPOINT A AS WELL THAT THESE ARE LIMITED TERM POSITION- THEY JUST TO DO WITH THE SHORT WORK IS SO. WITH COMMON NINETEEN THESE ARE NOT PERMANENT POSITIONS. THE OTHER THING WE THERE IS A LOT OF- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF. THOSE ATTACHED TO MAKING THIS. PROPOSAL AND PART OF THE WAY WE DEALT WITH- THE VARIABLES THAT ARE- THAT WE MADE WAS WE PUT IT SORT OF THIS IS KIND OF AN BUDGET SPEAK BUT WE- PUT. BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT ALLOWS IF THE MONEY ISN'T NEEDED. BUT IT CAN BE REVERTED TO THE GENERAL FUND. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT COLIN IS A FLUID ISSUE AND- AS WE GO FORWARD- THERE IS SOME CHANCE THAT- THE- PROPOSAL WOULD PUT FOR YOU MAY BE. TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE BUT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT S WE TRIED TO. PUT IT IN ITS OWN BUDGET ITEM WHICH ALLOWS IT TO BE TRANSPARENT AND SEEN BY EVERYBODY. AND ALSO- MAKE SURE THAT- IF THE FUNDING ISN'T NEEDED WEEKEND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND. IN IN. THIS AND HOW DO THOSE TWO THINGS WHEN. WIN WIN THESE TEMPORARY POSITIONS ACTUALLY SUNSET. IS OUR BACKSTOPS DESERVES A SUNSET DATE AND SECONDLY. A WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD TRIGGER THE- OF THE RETURN OF THESE DOLLARS THE GENERAL FUND IS IT IS IT STIPULATED THAT THAT DECISION WILL COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE OF ITS THIS COMMITTEE THAT'S- THIS ANALYZING MOVING MOVING THE ITEM FORWARD- OKAY I'M NOT CLEAR ON THAT. PIECE OF IT. OR IS IT OR IS THIS A SORT OF THE BUDDY SYSTEM THAT WE HOPE WE HOPE THAT SOMEBODY CATCHES IT AND DECIDES TO BRING IT BACK AND TALK TO US ABOUT RETURN TO GENERAL FUND I COULD UNDERSTAND. THE HONOR SYSTEM YEAH THE OPPOSITION. OKAY YES SORRY THE OPPOSITION'S THEMSELVES ARE LIMITED TERM THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND THAT WOULD GO AWAY AT THAT POINT- THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ITSELF. HAS US NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE I BELIEVE- WHEN- IF THE FUNDS ARE NOT NEEDED. PERFECT THANK YOU. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OPEN SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON. ISSUE THREE. BY THE CLOSURE OF DO WELL. DO ALL OF THE CLOSURE OF DHUL LOCATIONAL INSTITUTE- AND WILL HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM CDC ARE I GUESS- MISTER SWANSON THAT YOU. THAT'S RIGHT- ISSUE. THREE ALL ON.

WELL LET ME LAY OUT SOME QUESTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN SORT OF PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER ENOUGH AND HOPEFULLY A SINGLE ANSWER. SO ABOUT WHAT MEASURES ARE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT D. V. I. REMAINS ON TRACK FOR CLOSURE. IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. WHAT IS THE HOUSING PLAN FOR THE INCARCERATED- CURRENTLY HOUSED A DVI. DO YOU HAVE A DOZEN MINISTRATION HAVE A PLAN FOR THE LAND IN THE FACILITY AFTER IT HAS BEEN CLOSED. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE NEED FOR RESOURCES WHEN THE FACILITY IS IN THE- QUOTE UNQUOTE WARM SHUT DOWN MODE. AND THEN OF FOR THE WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR- FOR YOU MISTER SWANSON AND THEN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE ALEJO. OR I DIDN'T EVEN CALLING THEM. SORRY OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. SORRY WE GO BACK. IF ANY FRIENDS OR DEPARTMENT OF FIVE MINUTES CAN HEAR ME OKAY YES GO AHEAD. PERFECT OKAY THE SENATOR ALSO- TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PLAN FOR LAND AND FACILITY RESOURCES. AT THIS POINT THE ADMINISTRATION- PLANS TO KEEP. DVI IN THE WARM SHUT DOWN MODE BASICALLY UNTIL A SPECIFIC BIG DISPOSITION METHOD IS DETERMINES. WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON THIS CALL SO WE CAN OF COURSE GET BACK WITH MORE. INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACILITY RESOURCES BUT ESSENTIALLY THE WARM SHUT DOWN IS DESIGNED TO KIND OF KEEP THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE INSTITUTION IN SHAPE SHOULD IT BE NEEDED INADVERTENCE SITUATION SO THIS INCLUDES- THE PLUMBING IN THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DJI'S WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. THINGS LIKE THAT. IT HAPPENED ANSWER FURTHER QUESTIONS. WHAT WERE YOU CAN ANSWER THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR IS THAT UP TO HIS RESPONSE. SORRY I WILL DEFER TO YOU- MY SEIZE YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY I THINK- IF WE COULD HAVE A RENEE PESTS- TAKE A STAB AT SOME OF YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS THERE. HEY THIS IS RENEE PATTERSON EASY ARE. RELATIVES YOUR QUESTION REGARDS TO THE TIMELINE AND YES AND TO KEEP US ON TRACK. IT IS YOUR HAS DEVELOPED A TIMELINE AND BATCH BEERS YOU PROCESS AND AT THE LAST ANNUAL DEFINED BY KELLY JAR. AND WE HAVE DEVELOPED A TIMELINE TO KEEP TRACK WITH THE STEPS ERIC. BIRDS TO- IMPLEMENTING THEY LAY OFF AND FRAZIER THE FACILITY AND IT IS SEEN AND IDENTIFYING THE OPTIONS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND STAFF AT THE LOCATIONS AND DEPRIVED OF THE- BENEFITS. M. AS OF TODAY WE ARE CURRENTLY ON TASK AND WE'RE EACH MEDIA EACH MILESTONE AND- AS PROJECTED AND ANTICIPATE THAT THERE IS NO ISSUE WITH THE CLOSURE DATE OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY- THANK. TWENTY ONE SORRY ONE TWENTY ONE SORRY. I THERE ANY ADDITIONAL ABOUT THE CLOSURE I AM I CAN ASSIST THOSE AND MY COLLEAGUE AT BEST ONE BEST AS WELL AS CAN SPEAK TO AND THE OTHER QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THE- TRANSFER OF THIS. OF THE OTHER PIECE. BOB I HAD THE ONE ABOUT THE HOUSING PLAN FOR A CAR STRANDED PEOPLE CURRENTLY HOUSED AT A DVI. YES IT CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION OKAY. INVESTORS SULOCHANA CALIFORNIA PARTNER QUESTIONS A REHABILITATION SO- I FIRST WANT TO PIGGY BACK ON ANTHONY'S ACT COVERAGE BACK ON THE ONE SHUT DOWN TEAM SO THE ONE SHUT DOWN IS. TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITY IN WORKING CONDITION PENDING DISPOSITION IN THE VAN WE HAD TO REACTIVATE FOR AN EMERGENCY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- BUT THE TEAM ITSELF IS A LITTLE LARGER THAN MOST ONE SHUT DOWN TEAMS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE FACILITY THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REENTRY FACILITY. EXCUSE ME NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THAT'S A- IT'S A VERY SMALL FACILITY TWENTY FOUR TOTAL BUILDINGS DON'T HAVE A WARM SHUTDOWN CHAMBERS THREE STAFF MEMBERS WHEREAS AB I HAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO BUILDINGS COMPARED TO TWENTY FOUR BUILDINGS AT MCW AFTER- THAT TOTALS US WHERE FOOTAGE OF THE ACREAGE IS A HUNDRED THREE ACRES AT. NCW ASSET TO OCCASIONAL INSTRUCTION IT'S ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES SO JUST EIGHT A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE SIZE ALSO JOEL HAS A WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT A REVERSE OSMOSIS PLANT WATER PLANT I'M SO THERE ARE LOT LARGER GROUNDS TO MAINTAIN I'M SURE IT'S JUST A LOT LARGER SCOPE COMPARED TO PREVIOUS CLOSURES WE'VE OUT- BUT- NOW TO MOVE ON TO THE INMATE POPULATION MOVEMENT. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THAT POPULATION MANAGEMENT UNIT IN THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WE DEVELOPED A- REDUCTION PLAN FOR THE PRISON POPULATION SO IT WILL BE. SOLELY TRANSFERRING INMATES OUT THERE'S A QUITE A PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO ENDORSE YOU MAY DETERMINE THE SECURITY LEVEL WHAT'S THE BEST INSTITUTION THEY CAN GO TO. OUR THEIR PROGRAM HOUSING AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS GIVEN THE R. CODE OUTBREAKS THAT ARE CORINNE PERIODICALLY. AND THEN YOU PUT HIM UP FOR TRANSFER WE HAVE TO DO A- PRE JEAN. SCREENING AND TESTING AND THEN YOU PUT THEM INTO A QUARANTINE PRIOR TO TRANSFER. AND THEN YOU GO IN WITH THE INMATES OUT AND SO WE HAVE PROXIMATE. LI HUNDRED ONE. SIXTY IN. ONLINE IN THE LATTER MINE IN THE WILL HAVE A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT PROBABLY MORE LIKE- SIXTY TO EIGHTY A MONTH. IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND THEN WILL STEP UP TO ABOUT HUNDRED SIXTY AMOUNT. ON THROUGH SPRING ALL THE WAY THROUGH LATE SUMMER I GET POPULATION DOWN. I'M SORRY REMIND ME WHAT THE TOTAL NUMBER THAT NEEDS TO BE. BOMMEL ARE CURRENTLY THE CURRENT POP IS THAT LITTLE OVER TWELVE HUNDRED INMATES. OKAY THANK YOU- JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO THE OF THIS WARM SHUT DOWN MODE- HOW WHEN CAN WE EXPECT A PLAN AS TO OF MAKING IT OF PERMANENT CLOSURE. OF IF IT'S IN THIS WARM SHUTDOWN MODE IS A LOT OF EXPENSE RELATED TO THAT ARE AS YOU ALL JUST EXPLAINED SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET TWO OF THE REAL CLOSURE AND A PLAN FOR- THE LAND IN THE FACILITY AFTER IT'S BEEN CLOSED. HI THIS IS ERIC SWANSON AGAIN- WE ARE- WALL WE STILL WAIT FOR A PERMANENT PLAN. AS MR VASCONCELOS NOTED WE DO NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROPERTY ITSELF COULD BE THE PLAN AND ALL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ITSELF IS SEEKING WILL WORK TOWARDS. FINDING A FINAL DISPOSITION OF THE PROPERTY BUT INTEL THAT CDCR NEEDS TO MAINTAIN THE GROUNDS- THAT HAS IN THE PAST ARE YOU THIS IS NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT THAT HAS IN THE PAST. TAKE IT A FEW YEARS TO HAPPEN- BUT UNTIL IT DOES WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THOSE GROUNDS. RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S PART OF THE MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO MAINTAIN A BECAUSE WE WILL BE SPENDING MONEY TO. MAINTAIN THOSE GROUNDS IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S- INCUMBENT ON US TO GET THE MAXIMUM SAVINGS THAT WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A PLAN. SO THAT WE COULD GET THE SAVINGS AND MOVE ON TO A GREATER AND BETTER USE OF THE FACILITIES SO. I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO GET THE ANSWER BUT- HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THE- WHO. ON WHO'S GOT THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN. BOB ON THE ON THE LAND IN THE FACILITY AFTER IT'S BEEN CLOSED I COULD JUST SEE THE SORT OF. HANGING OUT THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND WERE WASTED A LOT OF MONEY. ANY THOUGHTS FROM ANYBODY ON WHERE THIS ENDS UP AS FAR AS THE PLAN. AFTER THE CLOSURE TO MAKE SURE IT'S A CLOSER. I THINK HE WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING JUST TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT SENATOR DORADO. RESTRICTION DOESN'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PLAN AT THIS MOMENT THE ONE THING WE WANTED TO FLAG IS THAT THERE IS A NUMBER OF USES OF THIS FACILITY IN THE LAND AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION MOVING FORWARD. PARTICULARLY AT THE MOMENT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IS KIND OF SPACE CONSTRAINTS AND HOW WE UTILIZE SPACE AND IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE IF. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE DISPOSITION FOR THE PROPERTY IS AS WE SAID WE CAN'T AND THERE'S NO PLAN AT THIS POINT OTHER THAN MAINTAINING THE FACILITY IN ONE SHOT DOWN BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL I THINK. MOVING FORWARD ABOUT WHAT WE END UP DOING WITH THE FACILITY- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE FACILITY IN THE LANDS FOR CITY TERRACE. PURPOSES OKAY THANK YOU AND LASTLY FOR THE L. A. O. CAN YOU EXPLAIN- YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT THE STATE. COULD LIKELY CLOSE THREE MORE STATE PRISONS- BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. OF AND THEN WHAT COULD THE STATE DO TO ENSURE THAT WERE ON APATH TO CLOSING. MORE THAN TWO PRESENTS. GOOD MORNING THIS IS CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- BEFORE HE TURNED OUT WE DID HAVE A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATION OR A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO. MENTION THOSE RIGHT NOW OR SHOULD I COME BACK TO THOSE AFTER YOUR QUESTION NO I'M SORRY YOU SHOULD START WITH THAT. THANK YOU. SO FIRST WHEAT THERE'S THREE RECOMMENDATIONS WE FIRST WE RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING ACTION ON THE PROPOSED BUDGET ADJUSTMENT GIVEN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. IS PLANNING TO SUBMIT A REVISED ESTIMATE ADAM THE REVISION. SECOND WE FIND THAT THE TWELFTH- POSITIONS REQUESTED TO SUPPORT THE WORM SHUT DOWN OF DVI APPEARS EXCESSIVE GIVEN THAT CDCR REPORT HAS REPORTED TO US THAT IT CURRENTLY ONLY USES. TWO POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE WORM SHUT DOWN OF THAT ANOTHER PRESENT- THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY ALTHOUGH MR VASCONCELOS. JUST MENTIONED THREE POSITIONS SO THE LITTLE BIT OF- IT IN I'M CERTAINTY THERE BUT- REGARDLESS IT'S FAR SMALLER AND FAR FEWER POSITIONS THAN THE TWELVE BETTER REQUESTED AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT D. V. I. IS A LARGER. PRISON BUT NONETHELESS THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE- JUSTIFICATION FOR ALL TWELVE- IN OTHER WORDS CONNECTING THE SIZE OF THE FACILITY TO THE NEED FOR THOSE. THAT POSITIONS WE THINK THAT FIVE POSITIONS APPEARS REASONABLE SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING SEVEN OF THE POSITIONS WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE REQUEST BY. SIX HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND. EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. ARE THERE RECOMMENDATION TO THE FUTURE OF THE DVI FACILITY AS YOU YOU KNOW IT'S AS IS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED THERE IS NOT CURRENTLY A PLAN. FOR THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION- DVI OR THE SECOND PERSON THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COMMITTED TO CLOSING. I SO WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION REQUIRING CDCR TO REPORT BY JANUARY TENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ON WHAT OPTIONS IT'S CONSIDERING FOR THE ULTIMATE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION- DVI AS WELL AS THE SECOND PRESENT IT PLANS TO CLOSE. WE THINK THIS WILL HELP AVOID UNNECESSARY SPENDING ON WARM SHUT DOWN. DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OR SHALL I PROCEED TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. OKAY SO THE FIRST QUESTION WAS CAN ADD CAN I EXPLAIN- OUR ASSESSMENT THAT THE STATE COULD CLOSE FIVE PRESENTS I BELIEVE WAS THE QUESTION YEAH- OUR OUR ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON CCAR'S PROJECTIONS OF THE INMATE POPULATION THROUGH JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND JUST TO ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE POPULATION IS CURRENTLY VERY LOW AND TO ENSURE AWARE DUE TO. AB RESPONSES THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN IN- TO A DRESS CODE IN THE PRISONS. SUCH AS THAT DEFICIT SPENDING THAT INTAKE FROM COUNTY JAILS. AND THOSE ARE TEMPORARY MEASURES THAT WILL EAT- BE REMOVED EVENTUALLY. HOWEVER PREVIOUSLY ENACTED AND PLANNED POLICY CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT INMATES ARE REQUIRED TO SPEND IN PRISON GOING FORWARD AND- AS THOSE POLICY CHANGES TAKE HOLD THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BRING TO PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE INMATE POPULATION SUCH THAT EVEN AFTER THE TEMPERING CODE RELATED MEASURES GO AWAY THE POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO MAIN RELATIVELY LOW REACHING AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS A COUPLE TENS OF THOUSANDS LOWER THAN PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND SO. PREVIOUS INMATE POPULATION DECLINES HAVE BEEN ACCOMMODATED BY REMOVING INMATES FROM CONTRACT PRISONS BUT THE STATE IS ON THE VERGE OF REMOVING THE FINAL INMATES FROM CONTRACT PRISONS THIS YEAR SO GOING FORWARD- WHEN DECLINES ACCUMULATE TO THE SIZE OF A FROM TWO OF THE- CAPACITY OF ONE PRISON ESSENTIALLY THE STATE COULD ACCOMMODATE THE DECLINE BY CLOSING PRISONS. AND GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DECLINE THAT'S PROJECTED WE ESTIMATE THAT THE STATE COULD CLOSE AROUND FIVE PRISONS. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS- THOUGH THE ACTUAL AMOUNT COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC FACILITIES. THAT ARE CHOSEN AND THE AND THE CAPACITY OF THOSE FACILITIES. YOUR MEN I BELIEVE YOUR SECOND QUESTION. WAS HOW THE STATE CAN INSURE THAT IT'S ON IT STAYS ON A PATH TO CLOSING THESE PRISONS WAS THAT CORRECT YES YES. SO S. S. SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF THE POPULATION DECLINE THAT'S PROJECTED IS. HE PLANNED BUT NOT YET IMPLEMENTED- EXPANSION TO INMATE. TWO CREDITS WHICH ARE- TIME THAT INMATES CAN EARN OFF THEIR PRISON SENTENCE FOR MAINTAINING GOOD BEHAVIOR WHILE INCARCERATED. AND THAT- WAS SUPPOSED TO BE- WAS PLANNED TO BE IMPLEMENTED JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR BUT GIVEN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD TO SHIFT ITS ATTENTION TO ADDRESSING COVET THAT IMPLEMENTATION DATE HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK TO MARCH- SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT DATE SLIPS FURTHER. THAT WOULD LIKELY- IMPACT THAT POPULATION DECLINING COULD DELAY THE STATE'S ABILITY TO CLOSE A PRISON SO ONE THING THE STATE CAN DO IS SIMPLY- TRY TO PREVENT THAT IMPLEMENTATION DATE FROM GETTING PUSHED FURTHER BACK. AND THEN BEYOND THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE POPULATION DECLINES DON'T MATERIALIZE AS PROJECTED. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT THE STATE HAS TO. PUT THE STATE OR KEEP KEEP IT ON TRACK OF PUT IT BACK ON TRACK TO CLOSING THOSE PRESENTS AND THEY GENERALLY FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES. THE FIRST IT WOULD BE TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO REDUCE THE INMATE POPULATION WHICH- THAT COULD BE. SENTENCING CHANGES FOR- OF WHICH THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS. SECOND WOULD BE TO HOUSE MORE INMATES. IN FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OWNED PRISONS FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE COULD EXPAND YOU SAYS IT'S ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS CERTAIN INMATES TO SPEND THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR SENTENCE IN THE COMMUNITY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A PRO AGENT- AND THEN THE THIRD OPTION WOULD BE TO. REDUCE WIDER. I IS OFTEN CALLED THE BUT FOR WHICH AND BY THAT I MEAN THAT GIVEN A FEDERAL COURT ORDER RELATED TO IN PRISON OVERCROWDING THE STATE IS. LIMITED TO HOLDING NO MORE THAN ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND INMATES IN ITS STAND STATE OWNED PRISONS. BUT AT GIVEN THAT THERE CAN BE FLUCTUATION IN THE POPULATION THE STATE TYPICALLY SO IN PRE CODE RED AND HOLDS- ARETE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND INMATES FEWER THAN THAT LIMIT IN ITS PRISONS IN ORDER TO GIVE ITSELF SOME BUFFER IN THE EVENT THAT THE POPULATION INCREASES UNEXPECTEDLY. SO ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO SIMPLY HOT- OPERATE A SMALLER BUFFER HOUSING SAME- A THOUSAND INMATES FEWER THAN THE LIMIT- THE STATE WOULD POTENTIALLY WANT TO HOWEVER TAKE OTHER ACTION TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF VIOLATING THE COURT ORDER. SUCH AS FORMING AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTY SHERIFF'S TO DELAYED TRANSFER OF INMATES IN THE EVENT THAT THE POPULATION DOES APPROACH THAT COURT ORDERED LIMIT. OKAY EIGHT THOSE ARE GREAT SUGGESTIONS GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. FINANCE. I'M SORRY LET ME SHATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO ADD TO THAT PART OF THE ALLEY OWES RECOMMENDATION SO AS WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY CURRENTLY DUE TO TEMPORARY POPULATION REDUCTION AND JUST FUTURE ONGOING AB POPULATIONS ACTIONS IN THE EFFECTS OF KOVIN. M. CDCR NEEDS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE THEIR INSTITUTION POPULATION AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND EVEN AFTER THAT PANDEMIC SO THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IT'S- PREMATURE TO IDENTIFY IT TIMELINE FOR FUTURE PRISON PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND THE SECOND CLOSURE PLAN FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. ULTIMATELY THE POPULATION CULVERTED AND OTHER FACTORS WILL DICTATE. ANY FUTURE CLOSURES BEYOND THAT SO ALTHOUGH THE L. A. R. WAS RECOMMENDING THREE ADDITIONAL CLOSURES BEYOND THE TWO ALREADY PLANNED THEIR ADDITIONAL COURT PRESSURES THAT EXIST THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. EACH INSTITUTION CURRENTLY HAS ISOLATION SPACE TO ALLOW. FOR ANY OUTBREAKS OF COLD DEAD AND EVEN ONCE EVERYONE IS VACCINATED THERE COULD STILL BE RISKS OF OTHER AIRBORNE ELLIS'S WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN WITHIN A PRISON. SO WE'RE STILL CONSIDERING DIFFERENT THE USE OF DIFFERENT BANDS WHICH ARE POTENTIALLY MORE AT RISK AND RIGHT NOW THE COURTS ARE WATCHING AND LOOKING AT HOW THESE ISSUES WILL BE HANDED IN THE LONG TERM. SO WERE RELUCTANT TO CLOSE ANY ADDITIONAL PERSONS BEYOND THAT TO YOU BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COURTS WILL DO SO THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD- JUST. BEYOND STRICTLY THE POPULATION. THANK YOU. SURE YOU'RE RAISING THE ISSUES OF SAFETY- FOR EVERYONE- BOTH THE STAFF AS WELL AS THE AS THE INCARCERATED- I THINK WE JUST NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS MORE CERTAINTY IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S AN ABSOLUTE OR ITS AND FLEXIBLE WE GIVE A DIRECTION- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ASKING ABOUT FOUGHT LET'S WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT- COLLEAGUES. IN THE QUESTION NOTHING OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH WE'RE MOVING ON TO ISSUE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE VOTING ON THAT LAN ISSUE NUMBER FOUR THIS IS ON CORRECTIONAL STAFF TRAINING AND JOB SHADOWING. AGAIN MISTER SWANSON I BELIEVE. YEAH CAN'T HEAR YOU MISS. THIS IS. ONE ONE. SORRY ABOUT THAT THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS IT WILL GIVE YOU A PASS ONE TIME NO DISCUSS. IT ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD. ISSUE FOR REQUESTED AUGMENTATION OF NINETEEN POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND FIFTY NINE POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ROOF DEPARTMENTAL TRAINING OF INSTITUTIONAL BASED CUSTODY STAFF SO THIS REQUEST REALLY CONSIST OF THREE COMPONENTS IT'S THE REACTIVATION OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY FOR SOME HANDS ON IT REALITY BASED TRAINING- NUMBER TWO IMPLEMENTATION OF A JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM FOR NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. AND NUMBER THREE INCREASE SINCE- COMMISSION ON CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING WHICH WILL NOW REFERRED TO AS C. POST IS THAT SUCH A LONG NAME. TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO CUSTODY AT NON CUSTODY STAFF. WITH ME TODAY FOR THIS ISSUE IS AN AGREED A DUBLIN OHIO- WHO'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C. POST AND CRISTINA ARROYO WAS A CORRECTIONAL BUSINESS MANAGER AT OUR- TREATING GROUP- WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY IT'S THE CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS THAT THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND HOW DO WE MEASURE WELL KINDA METRICS OR WHAT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MEASURE IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO DO WITH THIS- WITH THIS TRAINING. THANK YOU SENATOR IN RANDOM AND I- FROM RUNNING SECULAR DIRECTOR FROM SEACOAST- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS YOU HAS YOUR QUESTION AND YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS- PROPOSAL. AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY MORE CONFIDENT AND BETTER PREPARED CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHEN THEY ASSUME THEY'RE INDEPENDENT POST OF THE INSTITUTIONS- RIGHT NOW THEY ARE PROVIDED A BASIC ACADEMY TRAINING AT ANY COMPANY SETTING THAT IS NOT PRESENT- THEREFORE IT IS HARD TO REPLICATE SOME OF THE MORE HIGH RISK ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER- THAT THEY MAY BE ASSIGNED UPON ARRIVING TO AN INSTITUTION. THIS PROPOSAL SERVES TO CLOSE THAT GAP IN TRAINING BY ONE PROVIDING THEM PROBLEM BASED LEARNING SITUATIONS IN A REALITY BASED TRAINING- JUST SILLY. AND ALSO PROVIDING THEM- ON THE JOB TRAINING THROUGH JOB SHADOWING WHERE THEY'LL ACTUALLY BE LEARNING THEIR ROLE AS A CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICER AT THE INSTITUTION WHERE THEY WORK. I'M IN A REAL TIME ENVIRONMENT. AND JUST PREPARE TO DO. THIS OF THE ENHANCED ENSURE. BY WAY OF THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE NEW OFFICERS POST THEIR TRAINING AND JOB SHADOWING- INTERVIEWING THEIR SUPERVISORS AND ALSO AND THEY'RE HIRING AUTHORITIES ON WHETHER OR NOT THE TRAINING ENHANCEMENTS. HAVE BEEN TRACKED RESULTED IN A BETTER PREPARED OR MORE PREPARED CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICER TO ASSUME AN INDEPENDENT- POST AND SOME OF THESE MORE HIGH RISK OR HIGH CRITICAL POSTS- AND THOSE INTERVIEWS ARE THINGS THAT WE- HAVE CONDUCTED- PRE THIS PROPOSAL TO FIND OUT WHAT THE NEEDS WERE. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN CIRCLE BACK AND- CONDUCTS SIMILAR INTERVIEWS TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS ENHANCEMENT HASN'T. DROPPED CLOSE THAT GAP IN TRAINING. THANK YOU- WHAT IS LED TO YOU PROPOSE IN THIS- I GUESS I'M NOT SURE WHY- I DON'T HERE IS WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE OR WHAT'S THE ISSUE WE'RE TRYING TO THE SOLVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL I UNDERSTAND. BASICALLY IN TRAINING IN GENERAL YOU ALWAYS LOOK FOR YOU KNOW BETTER TO BUT I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO TRYING DO HERE DO YOU TO ACCOMPLISH. AND IS. THE RESULT IT'S THE RESULT OF WHAT THERE'S- PROBLEMS WHAT WHAT ARE THE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS BY CHANGING. THE SYSTEM AND THE TRAINING. THANK YOU SO- OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEN AGAIN TO THE EXTENT WE COULDN'T TWENTY WITH ACTUALLY TRAVELED TO OVER TWENTY FIVE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS- INTERVIEWING- BOTH NEW OFFICERS AND SUPERVISORS THE HIRING AUTHORITY ABOUT THE BASIC TRAINING EXPERIENCE- BOTH MYSELF AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT CONDUCTED THOSE INTERVIEWS- WE ARE SEEKING FEEDBACK ON HOW TRAINING CAN BE IMPROVED TO BETTER PREPARE OUR OFFICERS FOR THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT. AND ALSO TO ENHANCE INMATE SAFETY- BETTER PREPARED CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS- SHOULD RESULT IN- MORE SAFETY FOR OUR STAFF AND OUR INMATES I'M HOUSING OR FACILITIES SO FROM THESE INTERVIEWS THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMON THEMES THAT EMERGED ONE OF THE MOST APPARENT TEAM WAS THAT WE NEEDED GREATER HANDS ON PRACTICE IN SOME OF THESE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS. THAT HAVE A PSYCHOMOTOR COMPONENT TO- YOU KNOW MAKING DECISIONS AND THEN REACTING TIMELY AND SITUATIONS THAT OCCUR. IN AN INSTITUTION ENVIRONMENT. YEAH GREATER IN ON. SKILLS BOTH WITH START WITH OUR NON TEST STAFFER MEDICAL STAFF AND OF COURSE OUR INMATES- BETTER TRAINING ON JUDGMENT WHICH- FEEDS INTO PROBLEM BASED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT EVENTS STYLE LEARNING OR PUTTING OUR CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS OR SKEWS ME OUR CADETS. AN ACTUAL SCENARIOS WHERE THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE REAL TIME DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO SECURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE PRESENT AND ALSO- DE. AS WE KNOW WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS WITH DIFFERENT MISSIONS- WITH DIFFERENT INMATE POPULATIONS AND DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO REMAIN POPULATIONS AND NOT ALL OF THAT CAN BE REPLICATED IN ACADEMY STARTING- THERE ARE CERTAIN POSTS THAT CAN'T BE REPLICATED ECONOMY CONTROL LOSES ONE OF- TRANSPORTATION OF INMATES- SOME OF OUR MEDICAL SHOULD ADD MEDICAL PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS. I'M SO WHAT DOES TRAINING PROPOSAL DOES IS IT- SERVICE TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE CAN OFFER AT AN ACADEMY WHICH IS MORE KIND OF CLASSROOM AND OR DISCUSSION BASED LEARNING- TO PUT THEM IN A REAL LIFE TRAINING ENVIRONMENT WHICH WE KNOW FROM INTO ADULT LEARNING PERSPECTIVE. IS A BETTER WAY FOR US TO CONVEY INFORMATION AND EXPECT OUR NEW CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THESE ABILITIES NOT JUST HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE BUT ACTUALLY EXECUTE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS REQUIRED THIS LEVEL OF- PROBLEM. SOLVING AND REACTIONS. OKAY AND THEN- A FINAL FOR ME FOR ME IS- THIS SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS OR CADETS. BOB HOW ABOUT THE EXISTING- OFFICERS. TO OUR EXISTING OFFICERS GO THROUGH ANNUAL TRAINING EVERY YEAR- SERVICE TO KIND OF REFRESH IF YOU WILL SOME OF THOSE MORE AND CRITICAL ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS- USE OF FORCE COMMUNICATION DE ESCALATION- YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR NEWER TRAINING ON DIVERSITY AND TRANSGENDER POPULATION SIX ARCHER. NEARLY THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON INEXPERIENCED NEW CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS THAT HAVE NEVER WORKED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT YOUR EXISTING STAFF HAVE DEVELOPED OVER TIME THE EXPERIENCE TO BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH INMATES WITH MEDICAL STAFF NON CUSTODY EXCEPT FOR A- SO THEY HAVE ALREADY LEARNED SOME OF THESE ON THE JOB TECHNIQUES JUST BY ROUTE BY. MEANS OF GOING THROUGH THEIR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM AND BEING AT THE INSTITUTION PERFORMING THEIR DUTIES- THIS PROPOSAL SERVICE YOU PROVIDE A TRAINING COMPONENT THAT- SHORES UP THIS IDEA OF TRIAL AND ERROR WHILE ON THE JOB- WHERE RISKS ARE ARE ARE OFTEN TIMES HIGHER IF MISTAKES ARE MADE- SO THAT THEY HAVE A TRANSITIONAL TRAINING. BEFORE THEY'RE LEFT INDEPENDENT ON THE COAST. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES ANNIE YES SENATOR NEWMAN. AND I'M SURE OKAY QUICK QUESTION SHOULD GUIDE THE ANNOUNCES WE GOT NOTES THAT THERE ARE FINES FOR THIRTY THREE CORRECTIONS SERGEANT POSITION ONE PER PERSON- ADDED NOTES THAT IN ADDITION TO THE JOB SHARING PROGRAM THEY WOULD PERFORM VARIOUS OTHER DUTIES RELATED TO STAFF TRAINING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAGE. HAVE GROWN IN RECENT YEARS ON A LEVEL THAT CAN BE CURRENTLY COMEDY WHAT ARE THOSE DUTIES I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT- UNINTENTIONALLY CREATING- SOME RESPONSIBILITIES THAT DON'T DIRECTLY RELATE TO THIS BUDGET REQUEST. REXEL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. AND IN SERVICE- TRAINING OFFICES AT EACH OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. BETTER STAFFED WITH ONE SERGEANT ONE CORRECTIONAL TRAINING SERGEANT- THAT SURGEON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING TRAINING FOR BOTH CUSTODY AND NON CUSTODY STAFF- AND THE TRAINING IS YOU KNOW VERY IN TERMS OF. THE TYPE OF TRAINING THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE LEVEL OF CARE AND- CUSTODY VERSUS NON CUSTOMERS AS MEDICAL STAFF. TO THE CURRENT I. S. T. OFFICES AS THEY'RE CALLED- ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH A LOT OF THE TRAINING RESPONSIBILITIES ESPECIALLY AS OF LATE- THERE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF OUR AUDITS. AND THAT GOAL LONGER COINCIDE WITH TRAINING OR COMPLIANCE AUDITS- EQUIPMENT SITTING ON IT SANTA COULDN'T SITTING FOR CUSTODY STAFF. THEY ALSO MUST PROVIDE INSTRUCTION AND ALL THE COURSES THAT ARE OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO WE TRAIN TWELVE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR- ALL OF THE STAFF WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. AND AS YOU WELL KNOW SOME INSTITUTIONS HAVE YOU KNOW GREATER THAN TWELVE HUNDRED STAFF- AT THE FACILITY- AND SO WITH THIS PROGRAM JOB SHADOWING. AND ALSO RESPONSIBILITIES OVER PARTNERSHIP WHERE. NEW STAFF WOULD BE PROVIDED ON THE JOB TRAINING. OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS WHICH IS THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. CALLED RELATED IN SACRAMENTO TRAINING AND THAT TRAINING IS REALLY SUPPOSED TO EMPHASIZE- HOW TO GET NEW STAFF BETTER PREPARED FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF OUR NEW CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS. WITH ONE TRAINING SERGEANT AT OUR INSTITUTIONS TODAY IT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE A JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM. PROVIDE RELATING SUPPLEMENTAL TRAINING TO APPRENTICES THAT RESIDE IN THE INSTITUTION OVER TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND ALSO SUPPORT ALL OF THE OTHER TRAINING NEEDS AND R. I. S. T. OFFICES. SO THIS PROPOSAL HELPS UP SOME OF THE- STAFF DIVISION THAT WE SEE. THAT THOSE ARE CLEARLY. FUNCTION SO. WHAT THINKING. HAS BEEN DONE WHAT IF YOU DON'T GET THE FULL ALLOCATION FOR ALL THIRTY THREE CORRECTION POSITIONS HOW WE ADDRESSES OTHER NEW AGE. YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND CREATE SOME SORT OF- GAP ANALYSIS BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT AND WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT. FROM ANOTHER AREA BUT AGAIN ANY TIME YOU'RE TRANSITIONING ANY MANPOWER YOU ARE DEPLETING IT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND TRAINING IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IN CDC ARE THAT- IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM FEASIBLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO. REALLY SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO I THINK CLOSE THE GAP ON TODAY- WITH TRAINING AND WITH PROVIDING CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR CURRENT CUSTODY FOLKS AND NON CáC FOLKS ARE INSTITUTIONS- THE ANSWER QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WOULD COME FROM. SHOULD THE DOCUMENT. THANK YOU. OKAY OF- I'M SORRY HOW DO I KEEP LEAVING THE L. A. L. SORRY L. A. L. PLEASE. I'M DRIVE KEEP DROPPING OFF NOT A PROBLEM AT SO I'M GOING TO STRUCTURE MY COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS- AROUND EACH COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL AND THEN ISSUE A ONE OVER ARCHING COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION THE FIRST COMPONENT IS THE RESOURCES FOR THE POST WHICH WE THINK WOULD HELP THE DEPARTMENT AT OUR EXCUSE ME SEACOAST BETTER MEET IF LEGISLATIVE MANDATE SO WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING THOSE RESOURCES BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T FACILITATE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE RESOURCES WOOD OUR HOPE HE POST BETTER MONITOR METRICS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AND TRAINING BUT THERE ISN'T A PLAN TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED OF THAT THOSE FINDINGS. AND SO AND THIS IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN GIVEN THAT THE- THERE'S BEEN SOME. I OF VARIOUS PRISONS RELATED TO STAFF MISCONDUCT- THAT COULD BE TIED TO TRAINING DEFICIENCIES SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE KEPT WELL INFORMED OF. ISSUES RELATED TO STAFF PERFORMANCE AND TRAINING. SO WE RECOMMEND PASSING TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION REQUIRING C. COST TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE BEGINNING JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON RELEVANT DATA- CONCERNING TRAINING OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONS IT DRAWS FROM THE DATA AS WELL AS- PLANS TO ADDRESS ANY. CHALLENGES OR CONCERNS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. THE SECOND COMPONENT APPROACH OF THE PROPOSAL IS THE NEW FACILITY FOR HANDS ON TRAINING THAT WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE EXISTING ACADEMY FOR TRAINING NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND WE THINK THAT THIS- APPEARS WORTHWHILE TO INSURING JEFF- THAT NEW OFFICERS ARRIVE AT THEIR POSTS- WELL PREPARED SO WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING IT. THE THIRD COMPONENT IS THE NEW JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM FOR OFFICERS AFTER THEY GRADUATE FROM THE CAN THE ACADEMY IN WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE PRISON WHERE WHERE THEY'LL BE WORKING. SIMILARLY TO THE HANDS ON TRAINING FACILITY WE THINK THAT THE GENERAL IDEA OF THIS ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT SPECIFIC RESOURCES REQUESTED TO SUPPORT IT- I WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE THIRTY THREE STARTING POSITIONS SO I'LL JUST BE BRIEF- SEVENTEEN OF THE POSITIONS ARE RELATED TO THE- WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW JOB. SHADOWING PROGRAM BUT THE REMAINING SIXTEEN ARE DRIVEN BY IT AN INTENTION TO RELIEVE EXISTING STAFF. OF CERTAIN DUTIES SO THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON OTHER WORK THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT REPORT ISN'T GETTING DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO. RIGHT ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO JUSTIFY THE NEEDS FOR THOSE SEVENTEEN POSITIONS- SO WE WOULD EXPECT FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE DATA DEMONSTRATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH WORKLOAD IS DELAYED AND- A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY POSITIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET THAT WORK. DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE SEVENTEEN POSITIONS. AND ASSOCIATED TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION IN ANNUAL FUNDING. THE SECOND A RESOURCE FOR THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH IS THE SIX POINT TWO MILLION TO PAY THE NEW OFFICERS WHILE THEY'RE ARTICIPATING IN THE THREE WEEKS OF JOB SHADOWING. AND NOT BECAUSE THAT NUMBER IS BASED OFF AN ASSUMPTION THAT CDCR WILL HAVE A ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OFFICERS GOINGTHROUGH THE JOB SHATTERING PROGRAM ANNUALLY BUT AFTER DEVELOPING THE BCP THE DEPARTMENT ASTON'S REVISED THEIR ESTIMATE ON THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS IT EXPECTS TO PRODUCE IN THE BUDGET YEAR 210-004-0060 SIX. SO WE RECOMMEND REDUCING THE FUNDING BY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS- FEWER NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO GO THROUGH THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE MY FINAL COMMENT IS AN OVERARCHING ONE- AND THAT IS THAT PRISON CLOSURES WILL REDUCE THE NEED FOR NEW OFFICERS IN THE FUTURE- IN THE YEARS WHEN. AROUND WHEN THE PRISONS ARE CLOSED. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN A PRISON IS CLOSED OFFICERS OUT THERE PRISON HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE. TO FILL VACANCIES AT OTHER PRISONS WHICH THEN REDUCES THE NEED FOR CDC ARE TO. PRODUCE NEW OFFICERS THERE IT'S ACADEMY TO. FILL THOSE VACANCIES. SO IN TYPICAL PEOPLE ARE PAST YEARS- CCAR'S- NEED FOR NEW OFFICERS IS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND SO IT'S BUDGET IS AN ADJUSTED ANNUALLY BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE NEED FOR NEW OFFICERS BUT GIVEN THE ANTICIPATED PRISON CLOSURES WE THINK THAT THE EXISTING BASE FUNDING AS WELL AS THE OUT YOUR COMPONENTS OF FOR CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE ARE YOUR COMPONENTS- THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED. HERE TODAY SUCH AS THAT FUNDING FOR NEW OFFICERS GOING THROUGH THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM. WILL BECOME EXCESSIVE SO WE RECOMMEND PASSING BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE ADJUSTMENTS TO CDC ARTS BUDGET FOR TRAINING NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT CDC ARE ALREADY ADDRESS OTHER AREAS OF ITS BUDGET. IN RESPONSE ANNUALLY- BASED ON CHANGES IN VARIOUS CASELOADS OR OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF INMATES ARE PAROLEES. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY NORTH QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES OKAY SO- WE'RE GONNA HOLD THAT OPEN AND MOVE ON NOW- TO ISSUE FIVE AND THIS IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE ARE WE ARE YOU ARE YOU OKAY WITH A TOPPING AND IN A AND FOR A FEW COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THAT LEO. APOLOGIZE FOR ACTING NO I APOLOGIZE I DROP YOU CAN. BOOK YOUR NAME OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE WITH. THANK YOU THANK YOU COARSELY MATT APART OF SCIENCE. AT YOU. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE L. RECOMMENDATIONS- WE OPPOSE THE ADDITION OF ANY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION- WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY BUT WE RESPECT THE LEGISLATURE'S DESIRE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO EXPLORE WHAT'S- AVAILABLE AND REASONABLE AS WELL AS ANY POTENTIAL. FISCAL IMPACT OF WHAT THAT MIGHT RESULT IN. IN RESPONSE TO THE JOB SHADOWING THE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN SERGEANTS. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SERGEANT AT EACH INSTITUTION DEDICATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM EACH INSTITUTION HAS A DIFFERENT LAYOUT MISSION. INMATE POPULATION AND ITS OWN UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES SO WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR STAFF WHO OVERSEE THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM TO REALLY BE WELL VERSED IN THE SPECIFICS OF THEIR INSTITUTION SO THAT NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS REALLY RECEIVED THEIR SITE SPECIFIC. TRAINING AND THEY'LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE STAFF TO ENSURE THAT THE TRAINING IS EFFECTIVE INFORMATIVE AND REALLY MAXIMIZES THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE THERE. IN RESPONSE TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACADEMY WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO CONSIDERADJUSTING THE OVERALL ECONOMY RESOURCES THERE'S AND NUMEROUS UNKNOWNS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THAT CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IN THE LONG TERM. THE ATTRITION RATE ITSELF IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THERE'S BEEN ADDITIONAL RETIREMENTS DUE TO COAL FED- SALARY CHANGES AFFECT ATTRITION AND JUST THE EFFECTS OF PRISON PRISON CLOSURE IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. SO EVEN IF THERE'S A REDUCING IN THE SHORT TERM THOUGH WILL BE CONTINUED RETIREMENTS WHICH WILL NEED TO BE BACK FELT. SO WE STILL NEED THE ECONOMY INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE AS THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO BE READY FOR A LONGER TERM CHANGES TO THEIR WORKFORCE. HOWEVER WE WOULD CONSIDER CONSOLIDATION WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. BUT IT'S STILL PREMATURE NOW. THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY DID I GET EVERYBODY HERE OKAY. ALL RIGHT ISSUE FIVE- TECHNOLOGY FOR INMATES PARTICIPATING IN ACADEMIC PROGRAMS MISTER SWANSON I BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA PRESENT. THAT'S RIGHT ISSUE FIVE- IS AN ISSUE WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS AN APARTMENT YOUR REQUEST TWENTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND FORTY THREE POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN SMALLER AMOUNTS IN FUTURE YEARS. DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DIDN'T CLIENT LAPTOPS FOR INMATES TO ENHANCE THEIR EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND CREATE A CLOUD NETWORK- REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS SUPPORT. HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE- CHERYL LARSON WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. AND WAYNE BADDIE WHO IS THE CHIEF. OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. BOB SO IT'S UP TO US. ALL RIGHT I WAS GONNA GET A PRESENTATION. OKAY ALL RIGHT I DO HAVE QUESTIONS- I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S ON THE ONE HAND THE REALLY. GREAT THING TO HAVE- THE USE OF LAPTOPS FROM FOR LEARNING- BUT I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS WITH THAT RICK WITH REGARDS TO THAT- HOW DO YOU GET THE COMBINED- TECHNOLOGY- TRAINING ALL. AND NOT DROP THE FACE TO FACE- OF COURSES AND LEARNING THAT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE SEE NOW WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS COALBED AND THE OUR KIDS AND EVERYBODY'S ANXIOUS FOR THE KIDS TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL BUT YOU TO HAVE THE FACE TO FACE- AND NOT JUST ALL OVER A LAPTOP OVER A COMPUTER. I SUSPECT THAT THE A SIMILAR THING SO HOW WILL YOU DO I WILL YOU DO BOTH OR AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T REPLACE OF THE FACE TO FACE ODD TRAINING AND LEARNING AND AN EDUCATION THERE ARE THAT'S ONE- A WILL ONLINE COURSES BE. LITERACY BASED ARM OF THAT'S ANOTHER ONE AND- I'M CURIOUS IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT HOW THE LAPTOPS PROGRAM AND THE MC THREE. SKILL DEVELOPMENTS ALL WILL WORK TOGETHER SEOUL. WHO CAN ANSWER THOSE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS SARAH LARSON I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AT CDC I THINK I CAN HANDLE ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS CAN YOU HEAR ME OK BEFORE I GET STARTED PERFECT THANK YOU YES GREAT THANK YOU. SO TO START WITH YOUR QUESTION ABOUT FACE TO FACE PROGRAMMING AND WHETHER THIS IS A KIND OF A SUPPLEMENT FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR FACE TO FACE WE ABSOLUTELY THINK THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION I THINK OF IT AS YOU MENTIONED AS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE FOR WHY THAT IS AND THIS IS REALLY JUST MEANT TO SUPPORT A FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION THAT WE HAVE. WITH OUR TEACHERS IN OUR CLASSROOMS. A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT SERIOUSLY OUR EDUCATION IS LIKE A ONE ROOM SCHOOLHOUSE. WE HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE. YOU KNOW BUILDING EARLY AS YOU MENTIONED LITERACY SKILLS. AND WE ALSO HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE LOOKING TOWARDS A GED OR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA POTENTIALLY THINKING ABOUT. I'M PURSUING A COLLEGE EDUCATION OF SOME KIND. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE LEARNING KIND OF IT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND EVEN WITH A IN A CLASSROOM AND EVEN FOR STUDENTS WORK AND ACT THE SAME. LEARNING LEVEL THEY'RE GOING TO PROGRESS THROUGH DIFFERENT ON. MODULES OF LEARNING DIFFERENTLY. SO FOR EXAMPLE I MIGHT. EXCEL AT GEOMETRY BUT STRUGGLE WITH ALGEBRA AND ANOTHER STUDENT MIGHT. BE REALLY GOOD WITH- ALGEBRA BUT REALLY STRUGGLE WITH GEOMETRY. WITH THE LAPTOPS WOULD DO IS IN THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT. ALLOW FOR OUR TEACHERS TO PROVIDE TARGETED INSTRUCTION TO THOSE STUDENTS. OVER WHEN MOST OF THE CLASSROOM IS KIND OF READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LASSEN. BUT A STUDENT IS FEELING LIKE MAYBE. THEY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE PRACTICE. A TEACHER WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THE ADDITION PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HEROES TOLD TO HELP THEM. AND NOT IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE THE TEACHER COULD BE PROVIDING THEM WITH SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK THINK OF IT KIND OF LIKE A BREAKOUT GROUPS. AND TO ALLOW FOR TARGETED INSTRUCTION AND RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THOSE DEVICES WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT. ABILITY TO DO THAT KIND OF TARGETED INSTRUCTION IN THE SAME WAY. THIS WOULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT OUR NEEDS IN THE CLASSROOM HEY AND THEN THE OTHER BIG BENEFIT IS THAT WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS TO CONTINUE THEIR LEARNING OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. BUT WE CAN ASSIGN ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS OR OR VIDEOS TO WATCH. SOMETHING YOU CAN KIND OF FEEL LIKE HOMEWORK OR ADDITIONAL PRACTICE PROBLEMS THAT YOU MIGHT GET AND THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL AND THAT WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS SUPPORT THE INSTRUCTION THAT THEY'RE SEEING. FACE TO FACE AND ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE KIND OF IN THEIR FREE TIME AND WHERE THEY MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH. THEIR VARIOUS ASSIGNMENTS AND KIND OF CONTINUE BUT BANDS WE THINK THAT'LL REALLY HELP OUR STUDENTS. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT TOO IS. FOR STUDENTS IN FEWEST YARDS THERE'S A HUGE DIGITAL DIVIDE RIGHT NOW. THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REALLY REQUIRED. FOR PROFESSIONAL WORK WHEN STATE RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE LAPTOPS WILL REALLY HELP THEM TO BUILD THOSE SKILLS THAT THEY'LL NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL ONCE. THEY RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THAT PARTICULAR. IF NOT I'M HAPPY TO. COME BACK TO IT- WHEN YOUR QUESTION ABOUT LITERACY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE DEVICES TO ALL OF THE STUDENTS AND OUR DEAR PEOPLE AROUND SO THAT INCLUDES FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING ON THEIR LITERACY. AND WHO ARE WORKING ON HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING. A COLLEGE EDUCATION. TO OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OR PARTICIPATING IN OUR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL. INTERVENTIONS AND SO IT REALLY WILL SUPPORT A WIDE VARIETY OF STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE STUDENTS WHO. ARE WORKING ON THEIR LITERACY SKILLS. I IN THE LAST- SORRY GO HEAD NO NO NO THANK. IF YOU FINISH. SO THE LAST QUESTION THAT YOU HAD ASKED WAS ABOUT. KIND OF THE CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS I KNOW YOU MENTIONED AND SEE THREE IN PARTICULAR SO AS I MENTIONED THESE WILL SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THE WE DO HAVE A VARIETY OF AND WHAT WE CALL CTA CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE A INDUSTRY STANDARD CERTIFICATIONS INCLUDING NANCY THREE AND THERE ARE ALSO OTHERS JUST DEPENDING KIND OF ON THAT PARTICULAR ASKING YOU PROGRAM THAT EXIST. AND SO THESE DEVICES WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS SO THE WAY I THINK I KIND OF THINK ABOUT THESE DEVICES WHEN IT COMES TO CP IS. WILL USE. WHATEVER TOOL IS NECESSARY FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING SO THAT MAYBE A HAMMER IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU'RE AND YOU KNOW LEARNING SOME TRADE SKILLS AND IT MAY ALSO BE A MODULE THAT YOU'RE LEARNING ON A COMPUTER OR YOUR LEARNING CAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ON THE DEVICE THE KIND OF BUILD YOUR PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND SO WE'LL MAKE THOSE MODULES AVAILABLE IN OUR LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM I THINK IT'LL BE REALLY GREAT FOR OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY AND MORE TIME TO BUILD THOSE SKILLS AND- KIND OF CONTINUE THEIR LEARNING OUTSIDE OF JUST THE NORMAL CLASSROOM TIME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. BUT THEY'LL HAVE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF REVIEW AND- CAN TAKE MATERIAL IN INK AND PRACTICE WITH THAT- EAT. IN THE CLASSROOM AND ALSO OUTSIDE. OKAY GREAT JUST WHAT SMALL COSTA- CANNING CA OF PEOPLE TAKE THEIR CIVIL SERVICE EXAMS WITH THESE LAPTOPS. WE'LL BE WORKING ON AND IT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON KIND OF HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE THOSE SYSTEMS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MAKE AVAILABLE TO FOLKS WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS I THINK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE AND HONOR LEARNING MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS BUT JUST AS- EVERYONE IS AWARE WE ALSO HAVE CURRENTLY UP WHAT WE CALL OUR ARCADE SYSTEM. AND THAT PROVIDES ALL SORTS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY INFORMATION FOR AT OUR STUDENTS AS THEY'RE GETTING RELEASED AND THAT INCLUDES REAL TIME JOB INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE ON THE SYSTEM AND THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THESE DEVICES AND THAT INCLUDES NOT JUST CIVIL SERVICE BUT ALSO ALSO. A PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PURSUE IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY'RE NOT BEING RETURNED OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COLLEAGUES. ANY COUPLE YES CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU AFTER THE A COUPLE OF COURSE TO ARM. THIS BEING INFORMATION THAT THE SEVENTH- THIN CLIENT LAPTOPS OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY THAT NUMBER Y. THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND. AND HOW YOU HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THE- SURE ABSOLUTELY I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK. SO THE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND ROUGHLY REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE HAD IN OUR PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW SO AS I MENTIONED THAT'S ALL OF OUR DEAR PIEPER GAMS ACADEMIC EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS. AND WE REDUCE THE NUMBER SLIGHTLY FROM THE OVERALL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS JUST TO REFLECT THAT YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE IN TRANSIT OR MIGHT BE OUT TO CORD OR A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT OR THINGS LIKE THAT. WE THINK THIS REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT WILL NEED TO HAVE AVAILABLE I'M SURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS ONE WHEN THEY NEED IT. AND CAN YOU WITHIN THE NUMBER CAN YOU CAN YOU WILL YOU ARE CAN YOU PRIORITIZE AGAINST. DIFFERENT KINDS OF EDUCATION SO MY INSURANCE IS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND. INMATES RIGHT NOW WHO ENGAGE IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION WILL THEY RECEIVE PRIORITY OR OR IS THERE A MATRIX FOR THAT SORT OF- DETERMINATION. WE DO HAVE A- FOR OUR ROLLING OUT THE DEVICES- PRIMARILY THAT'S BASED ON EACH. INDIVIDUAL LOCATION EACH INSTITUTION RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE BEING PRIORITIZED I JUST AS WE BUILD OUT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE NETWORK AND I CAN PROVIDE THAT. I TEAR STAFF SO THAT YOU HAVE THAT AVAILABLE. SHOULD THAT SO THE CHARITY TOUCHED ON. THE KEY QUESTIONS FACE TO FACE EDUCATION WHICH IS CLEARLY- OF SIGNIFICANT VALUE- YOU KNOW BOTH FOR THE QUALITY EDUCATION BUT ALSO FOR- SOME OTHER SOFT SKILLS THAT ARE INCULCATED DURING THAT. MISTER CLEARLY DURING COLD GOOD- WE FACE SOME CHALLENGES BUT MOVING FORWARD. THERE IS SOME CONCEN. AMONG ADVOCATES IN PICTURESQUE SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT- THAT WILL STAY IN THE ONLINE LEARNING. SPACE AND NOT NATIONALLY RETURNED TO EITHER FACE TO FACE PROGRAMS OR PROJECTS IMPORTANTLY. RESPECT CONTINUE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. AND STATE COLLEGES. SO WHAT INSURANCE IS THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT THAT WE THESE. PROGRAMS WON'T BE DISPLACED OR COMPETE WITH FOR PROFIT. ONLINE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. YEAH THAT'S IT THE NEXT QUESTION SO RIGHT NOW ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT WE PARTNER WITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS- OR THAT- WE WORK WITH KIND OF. AND THREE D. R. P. ARE ACCREDITED NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS WE DO ALLOW STUDENTS TO PURSUE THE EDUCATION OUT THERE THEY WANT TO PURSUE AND IF THEY'RE READY FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND- THEIR INDIVIDUAL DESIRE IS TO PURSUE. A DEGREE KIND OF PRIVATELY. THERE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION THROUGH. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT MANY OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THAT PROMISE GRANT FUNDING WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO PURSUE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DEGREES AT NO COST FOR THEM. AND THAT'S THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF OUR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION STUDENTS AND HOW THEY'RE GETTING EDUCATION WE ALSO HAVE A SMALL NUMBER OF A BACHELOR'S DEGREE STUDENTS. WHO HAVE BEEN PURSUING I FACE TO FACE RIGHT NOW IT'S AND YOU KNOW MORE CORRESPONDENCE BASED BECAUSE OF COVERAGE BUT- WHO HAVE BEEN PERSON FACE TO FACE EDUCATION WITH OUR- CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE A FEW LOCATIONS WHERE WE'RE DOING THAT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE KIND OF A LIST OF THOSE. LOCATIONS ARE BREAK OUT KIND OF WHAT THAT PARTICIPATION. LOOKS LIKE BUT IT IS. VERY HEAVILY AND IN THE- CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY JUST. AND THEN- ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WITH ACCREDITED NONPROFIT SCHOOLS JUDICIARY AND THAT'S ENCOURAGING BUT WE WON REGION BERMAN- IS CONGRESS RECENT LIFTED THE BAN ON PELL GRANTS FOR INCARCERATED STUDENTS- AND SO THAT THAT. IN THE AGGREGATE REPRESENTS A LOT OF MONEY- AND SO DO WE HAVE YOUR ASSURANCE THAT WILL. PROTECT THOSE FUNDS I GUESS THOSE STUDENTS. FROM MARKETING AND ENROLLMENT IN FOR PROFIT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IT MAY NOT NOT BE NEARLY AS EFFICIENT AND NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE ONES THEY CURRENTLY UTILIZE. ALSO THE WALGREENS CHANGE HAS BEEN A VERY RECENT AND WON'T BE IMPLEMENTED FOR SOME TIME AND SO WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE- DETAILS OF HOW THAT WILL WORK AND SO I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION YET ON HOW THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON CURRENTLY AND AS WELL AS YOU KNOW MANY FOLKS WHO ARE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING OUR STUDENTS ACCESS TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT CURRENTLY THOSE ARE NOT THAT PULLS THAT WE PROVIDE PROGRAMMING FOR AND OUR INSTITUTIONS. BRIGITTA THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU. SENATOR CORTEZ. THE COMMAND CHAIR- CAN YOU CAN YOU EDUCATE ME A LITTLE BIT ON THE DOES NEED A WIRELESS AREAS AND- HOW THAT WORKS I KNOW THE NEXT TIME WE GET INTO CELLULAR INTERDICTION- BUT THAT REALLY SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO CELLULAR I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT SAFEGUARDS. ARE IN PLACE- IF THOSE CURRENTLY EXIST OR IF MORE. WILL BE NEEDED- FOR THIS PROGRAM. I THINK THIS QUESTION I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE WHILE NGUYEN BADDIE WHO HAS EXPERTISE IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AT BECAUSE I THINK HIS ANSWER PROBABLY I'M NOT WILL WILL BE THE MOST- I'LL- THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE WHEN BADLY CVC ARE SELDOM SENATOR DANCE YOUR QUESTION- WE HAVE WIRELESS IN OUR CLASSROOMS CURRENTLY- WE DO HAVE ACCESS AND ARE LIVING AREAS- PART OF OUR STRATEGY THOUGH IS TO REALLY HAVE SECURITY AROUND BOTH ACCESS AT THE NETWORK LEVEL USER SECURITY APPLICATION WEEK WE HAVE A PRETTY WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN. ON HOW TO SECURE TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE DON'T GRAB ANY ILLICIT ACCESS TO DEVICES. YEAH RIGHT OBVIOUSLY I DON'T NEED YOU TO DISCLOSE HOW ALL THAT WORKS YOU KNOW IN A IN A PUBLIC SETTING- BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS WORKING ERIC I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW- IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S- THAT'S LARGELY. PART OF WHAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUT- OBVIOUSLY IF WE WERE DEALING WITH- WITH FINANCES OR OF OR OTHER- GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS WE WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF AN AUDIT PROCESS IN THE REVIEW PROCESS- AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO JUMP AHEAD I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TIED TO. THE INTERDICTION PROGRAM OR IF IT'S JUST SOMETHING IS DONE SEPARATELY FOR THIS PROGRAM. BUT SENATOR WHEN BABBY AGAIN I CAN TELL YOU THAT- SECURITY FOR THIS PROPOSAL WAS OUR NUMBER% ONE PRIORITY- SO THERE'S pDIFFERENT LEVELS WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH INTO THE INTO THE WEEDS- THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS WERE GONNA HANDLE SECURITY OUT- WE DO HAVE AN INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICE WE- HAVE A- PRETTY ROBUST SECURITY PLATFORM- SO I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SENSE OF THE TOP OF OUR MINDS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. IT IS IT THE LET ME JUST ASK THIS MUCH DOES DOES IT INVOLVED ACTUAL REAL TIME MONITORING OF. THE SO WITHOUT THEM. WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH INTO IT- IT INVOLVES HAVING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT CENTRAL SO WE CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING THAT'S ON THE ENVIRONMENT WE CAN CONTROL ACCESS TO IT ACCESS OUT OF IT IN A DOES ALLOW US TO LOG WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR TO ALERT ON CERTAIN EVENTS. IT ISN'T. JUST A JUST A FOR FUTURE. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE QUESTION- EFFECT IS THAT IS THE SYSTEM. INTERNALLY AND CONFIDENTIALLY SERVICEABLE BY ACCESSIBLE COLLECTED OFFICIALS WHO WANT TO COME IN- AND UNDERSTAND IT IN A NON PUBLIC SETTING- WHAT THE SECURITY MEASURES ARE. I THINK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF- TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN YEAH I DON'T I'D LIKE TO COME IN AND- IT JUST- I'M A VISUAL PERSON LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY COMMENSALISM TIME OBVIOUSLY IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER. THANK YOU MANAGER. GREAT FROM THERE WE DO FINANCE. L. A. L. MISLEADING. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY I'M SORRY. ARAMBULA PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU OKAY GREAT THAT COLLEAGUES YEAH OKAY WONDERFUL ALL RIGHT. THERE ARE OTHER ANTI FRIENDS WHAT APARTMENT FINANCED BY OKAY YES PLEASE JUST WANTED OUT IN- NO FURTHER COMMENT FROM FINANCE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- LET'S SEE WE'RE ON NUMBER FIVE. YES OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE- TECHNOLOGY FOR INMATES ON ON ARNOLD ROUND. SORRY WHERE I JUST HAD ONE MORE I'M SORRY JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION- HOW MANY- STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN PRIVATE INSTITUTION COURSES AND THAT WHICHINSTITUTIONS. AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON. CLARIFY ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT LIKE A PRIVATE COLLEGE COURSE YES. I CAN PROVIDE THOSE NUMBERS TEARS HERE STAFF AS A FOLLOW UP WITH THE BEST SPECIFIC NUMBERS OKAY AND THEN WHICH INSTITUTIONS YES OKAY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON NOW WE CAN TO ISSUE SIX CELLULAR INTRODUCTION PROGRAM MISTER SWANSON. YES IF YOU SIX IS A REQUEST FOR ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO AND I'M GOING TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING MANAGED ACCESS SYSTEM. AND EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS THIS SYSTEM AS WE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THE LAST ISSUE PREVENTS UNAUTHORIZED CELLPHONE USE. IN THE INSTITUTION. WITH ME ON THIS ISSUE ARE ASSOCIATE WARDEN MERION SPEARMAN AND TAMMY IRWIN WHO IS THE CHIEF OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEM. SERVICES AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO START WITH HIM IF WE COULD JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS REQUEST. IRWIN CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES GO AHEAD. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE DEPARTMENT WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND TO INITIATE A CONTRACT FOR INMATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND IT INCLUDED MANAGED ACCESS. WHICH IS THE CELLULAR INTERDICTION- TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS US TO CONTROL UNAUTHORISED ACCESS TO AND BY THE USE OF CONTRABAND DEVICES. SO IN IT WAS INITIALLY PLANNED TO DEPLOY AND MANAGE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND INSTITUTIONS BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT WAS DECIDED- TO REFOCUS ON THAT INTENTION AND REDIRECT- BE CONCENTRATION NOT ON THE DEVICES THAT IT ALREADY MADE IT FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT BUT TO- TRY TO. PRETEND TO BE INTRODUCTION- CONTRABAND AND DEVICES ARE BEFORE THEY ENTERED INTO THAT THE PRESENT. SEVEN TWO SIXTEEN IT WAS RENEGOTIATED TO- STOP THE EXPANSION OF MANAGE ACCESS AND TO BRING IN OTHER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE EXTRA BAGGAGE- AND PARCEL SCANNERS LOW DOES FULL BODY SCANNERS- METAL DETECTORS I'LL WALK THROUGH METAL DETECTORS AND METAL DETECTORS. SO I'M THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE HAVE MANAGED ACCESS EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS. BERMAN JUST RECENTLY- NEGOTIATED A CONTRACT FOR INMATE COMMUNICATIONS AND IT WAS- AND IT DOES NOT INCLUDE MANAGED ACCESS. THOSE FOCUSES JUST ON THE CAN YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND SEARCH THE TECHNOLOGY- TO INTERJECT AND TO- CONTROL CELLULAR CONNECTIVITY FROM COUNTRYMEN DEVICES. IS NOW GOING TO BE A SEPARATE CONTRACT WITH THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL AND HOW WE WOULD ASK YOU SEE OUR WILL MANAGE THE AB MANAGE. ACCESS AND SERVICE PROVIDER. I'M AND KEEP THE AS- RUNNING AND OPTIMIZED ASK THE EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS WHERE IT EXISTS. OKAY RIGHT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR VALET- HAVE ANY COMMENTS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED SANCTIONING YES. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU- BUT IN THE COURSE OF REVIEWING IT WE DID LEARN THAT AS WAS MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENT HAS RENEGOTIATED ITS CONTRACT FOR PROVIDING- INMATES IN THE WORDS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND SO WHEN THE DETAILS OF THAT CONTRACT I SUCH AS A PRICE OF PHONE CALLS BECOME AVAILABLE WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND- LET STAFF KNOW IF WE IDENTIFY ANY CONCERNS AT THAT POINT. GREAT THANK YOU- FINANCE ANY COMMENTS. LENITION MATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. OKAY I DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS EITHER SO YOU'RE TO HOLD OPEN AND I MOVE ON. FROM ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN SORRY I SHOULD LOOK. SOMEBODY LOOKING OUT FOR THE HANDS I FORGET TO LOOK OUT FOR HER NEEDS OKAY. HERE AGAIN. ISSUE SEVEN IS ACTUALLY TWO ISSUES COMBINED- BUT THEY'RE CONNECTED IN THAT THEY'RE BOTH FOOD RELATED REQUEST FOR INCARCERATED POPULATION. THE FIRST IS RELATED TO OUR INSTITUTION CANTEENS WERE REQUESTING TWO MILLION DOLLARS INMATE WELFARE FUND AND SEVEN POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR- CANTEEN AND PROVIDING COULD BE INCREASED ACCESS TO CANTEEN LINES. THE SECOND INVOLVES AT INCREASING THE STATEWIDE FEEDING RATE BY TWENTY TWO CENTS PER INMATE PER DAY FOR FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO UPDATE THE FOOD MENU FOR ALL OUR INMATES TO PROVIDE HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS AT MEALS. THE COST OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD DEPEND ON THE ESTIMATED POPULATION THE INSTITUTIONS BUT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY. SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WISPY DAYS KEITH ROBINSON WHO'S THE DEPARTMENT FOOD ADMINISTRATOR IN ANY CA CST ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE ACCOUNTING SERVICES BRANCH I THINK WE'LL START WITH A EMAIL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE CANTEEN RESOURCES. THANK THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. SO CANTEEN TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW THE CANTEEN IS THE BASICALLY THE STORES THAT THE IMAGE SHOPS SHOP IN INSIDE THE INSTITUTION. THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PROGRAMMING FOR THE INMATES THAT IMPORTANT BENEFIT TO THE ENEMY AN INMATE WELFARE FUND EXIST ONLY TO BENEFIT THE IN MAY. SO THE MAJORITY OF THE REVENUE INSIDE THE INMATE WELFARE FUND IS BASED ON SALES- FROM THOSE CAMPAIGN. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE CAMPAIGN HAS REALLY INCREASED THE VOLUME NOT ONLY OF SALES OF GOODS. AND THAT IS MOSTLY DUE TO THE INCREASE AND PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR THE INMATES. SO THEY HAVE MORE SHOPPING BUT ALSO THE CANTEEN HAS BECOME- THE PLACE WHERE THEY DISTRIBUTE BUT HE'S THESE- OVER THE COUNTER. MEDICATIONS THAT THE INMATES USED TO HAVE TOGO TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS FOR THEY CAN NOW GET ATKINS TEAM. AS WELL AS WE NOW DISTRIBUTE READERS- TO THE CANTEEN POPULATION. SO THAT IS ALSO BROUGHT A LOT OF INMATES WHO NORMALLY DIDN'T SHOP- IF THEY WERE INDIGENT IN THE CANTEEN- FOR THOSE SERVICES- IN ORDER. IS RICK- ADDITIONAL SO POSITION. OF FIRST A COUPLE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE VERY SPECIFIC- DIFFICULTIES WITH CANTEEN- THAT COULD BE BACK OUT FACILITIES. WHICH TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME- RATHER THAN HAVING THE INMATES DOWN THE LINE IT ALSO- HAS SOME INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE. VARIOUS TRAINING- PROGRAMMING AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING WHICH REQUIRES THE CANTEENS TO BE OPEN SIX OR SEVEN DAYS A WEEK I LONGER HOURS TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THE INMATES TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING TO THEIR PROGRAMMING. FOR THEIR CLASSES THANK INSTOCK CANTEEN. I STATE POSITIONS FOR THAT WORLD REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE ITEMS FOR SALE OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN INCREASE TO THE MAXIMUM LIMIT FOR SPENDING OF A 10% INCREASE-% IN FUTURE YEARS THE LAST TIME THAT THAT HAS BEEN INCREASED REMIXES TWO THOUSAND. OKAY AND CAN YOU TELL US SOME MORE ABOUT THE- HEALTHY MENU OPTIONS. WORSE YES THE HEALTHY MENU OPTIONS IN THE CANTEEN- WE'VE WORKED WITH A MISTER ROBINSON WHO HEARING ABOUT AND ALSO THE CHIEF DIETICIAN AT C. C. H. C. S. I'M CURRENTLY ABOUT 11% OF OUR SALES AT CANTEEN ARE CONSIDERED HEALTHY ITEMS- WE HAVE THINGS LIKE STRING CHEESE- HOUSE FISH. AND VEGETABLES- LOW SALT ITEMS. SALSA YOGURT- WHERE WE CAN. TALK ABOUT A HOME LAST SO WE ARE REALLY WORKING ON TRYING TO INCREASE THOSE HEALTHY ITEMS THAT WE DO OFFER AT THE CANTEEN FOR INMATES. AND WE WORK WITH- THAT COULD ADMINISTRATOR AND THE DIETICIAN IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE NUTRITION LABELS. AND IN THE FUTURE WE WILL BE WORKING WITH- I'M MORE CONTRACTED ITEMS. FOR SALE IN THE CANTEENS OF THOSE ITEMS. MAYBE NEXT WEEK COULD GO IF WE COULD- BOTTOM SURE WE CAN GO TO- KEITH ROBBINS WILL TALK ABOUT THE EFFORT TO GET OUR REGULAR MEALS- TO INCLUDE MORE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND FRESH ITEMS. WONDERFUL OKAY. YES KEITH ROBINSON ON CDC ARE. BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MYSELF ALONG WITH. THE CHIEF A DIETARY FROM HEALTH CARE DECIDED TO DEVELOP OF. FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES OF THE BOAT OF THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY VERSION AND NOW THERE IS A. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE WHERE. IT OF. WANTS US TO CREATE A HEALTHIER EATING PATTERNS FOR ADULTS. AND SO WE REDESIGNED AND REDEVELOPED THE MENU TO INCLUDE MORE FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WELL AND WILK AND WE PARED BACK ALONG WITH IDENTIFYING. ON OUR STATE STATEWIDE STANDARDIZED MENU HOW INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE- DIABETIC CAN IDENTIFY CARBOHYDRATE EXCHANGES SO THEY'RE ABLE TO FEED OFF OF THAT HE SMARTLY OFFER THE STATE WIDE MENU THAT IS DEVELOPED. THAT'S GREAT. WELL WE SELL REALLY WONDERFUL. THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO WE HAVE- WITH EARLIER- MARIO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON THE FIRST ISSUE REGARDING THAT CANTEEN RESOURCES WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ISSUES ON THE PROPOSAL OF THE HEALTHY MENU OPTIONS BUT WE DO NOT HAVE CONSERVATIVE PROVIDING A MAKE IT HEALTHY MENUS WHAT CITIES ARE HAS BEEN DOING SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE PROS FROM INSTRUCTORS WHICH THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT THE HEALTH NEEDS OR. ASPEN ADOPTED- BARBARA. IF YOU'LL COSTS AND EXCEEDED FOR MULTIPLE WORKS THE FUNDING RATES COME AT THREE. A CENTS PER DAY. THEN THERE DIGITAL THAT THE STARTING IS COME HIGHERHIGHER OF BUYING THAT DEALS TO ELIMINATE. COME FROM READER SAVINGS UNCLE PLANT OPERATION POSITION SUCH AS FARMERS A LOT. AND WHILE THESE POSITIONS AREN'T TO MAKE. THE MINISTRY HAVE BEEN TO FEDERAL HISTORICALLY AS A RESULT CITIES ARE COURTS TYPICALLY HAPPENED ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN SAVINGS- FROM THESE VACANT POSITIONS. AND THESE ARE HAVE TO CONTINUE USING THE SAVE TO PAY FOR COURSES OF THE COST OF THE EMAILS. BUT INDICATED IT IS NOT LEAVE THE SAVINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COME THAT ENTIRE HA. OF THE MATERIALS BEYOND THE EXISTING FUNDING. BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THEY WILL HAVE A LOWER VACANCIES TO THE PRISON CLOSURES ARE PLANNED. AS WELL AS THE END OF THE PANDEMIC. IN THE TEMPORARY PASSCODE TO POLICY THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE THAT IT DID LABOR. IS ON A NON THAT CAN BE SAVING. THE DEPARTMENT TO HAPPEN IN THE BUDGET YOUR HOWEVER I DID THAT ESTIMATE. AND HOW THE TOTAL ESTIMATED SAVINGS WOULD BE USED TO THE EXTENT IT DOESN'T ALL GO TOWARDS THE EMAIL COSTS. FOR MORE DUE TO THE HISTORICALLY HIGH VACANCY WE'VE BEEN BACK IN THE SHORT TERM REDIRECTING. SAVINGS TO SUPPORT ANY MEAL IS A REASONABLE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. IT IS GIVEN THE HISTORICAL DIFFICULTY OF FILLING THE BALLOT RATIONS POSITION SUGGESTING THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME FUNDING IN THIS AREA. I HAD GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO UTILIZE OUT FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE DO NOT THINK IT SHOULD BE A LONG TERM STRATEGY IS BECAUSE USING THE FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS INTENDED FOR PROVIDING THE FUNDING FOR. OPERATIONS WE SHOULD BE GOING TOWARDS. REPAIRING THAT RETAINING CDCR INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS COMMON IN. EXECUTIVE PRODUCER PARA. FOR EXAMPLE THE REASON STUDY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. BILL DOLLAR IN. NEED A NETWORK OLDEST PERSON. THANK YOU FOR ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED TO THE AYE OPERATIONS VACANCY AND ADDRESS THE OPERATION ORACLE AT SCHOOL I MAD. THE KNOWLEDGE SEATS ARE HOSTAGE A STEP. JUNE TWENTY EIGHTY EIGHT RECRUIT EFFORTS FOR THESE. I DON'T THINK ADDITIONAL. COULD BE. FOR EXAM KIDS. ARE CONSIDERED. OTHER OPTIONS SUCH AS INCREASE PAY RATE INSTITUTIONAL. HIGH BUT RATES THE TRACK OR CANDIDATES- POTENTIALLY HIRING CONTRACTORS ON. BASIS USING THE EXISTING VACANCY SAVINGS TELEVISION CAN BE FILLED WITH SEVERAL SERVICE. EMPLOYEES AND CONSIDERING MAKING GREAT USE OF INMATES FROM. FUNDS X. TRAINING THEM ON THE NAY SKILLS. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS WE ARE HERE IN THE FOR US WE- REQUIREMENTS TO RECALL ON NUMBER SAVINGS THE BUDGET ARE OUT OF AT THE S. HOW PLANTS USE A TOTAL ESTIMATE SAVINGS INTO ONE POINT TWO. AND INTEL THAT INFORMATION COMES OUT. RECOMMEND US ARE SOME DACIAN WITHHOLD OPTIONAL THE GOVERNOR TO PUT OLD UNTIL THAT. WE HAD A- BECAUSE IT COULD. BE BIG THAT ADDITION TELEPHONE IT'S NOT ACT NECESSARY AND BAY CITY HE SAID FROM BECAUSE- WERE BE SELF TO COVER THE FULL OF IN MIDDLE. AND THEN A LOT OF EVERY DAY MISTER CLASS ARE COMBINED DETAIL PLANS ADDRESS THE PANEL. WORK AND INTO IN THE BUILDING PLAN IT IS SHOULD THE MANAGER IT IS A- OF OUR- TO GO MORE. BEYONDADDITIONAL EFFORTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR A ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WAS ON OUR LOW. BUT IT WAS A VERY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ANY LET'S SEE WE'VE GOT FINANCE. COMMENT I LET ME SEE DEPARTMENT ASIDE- I WE ARE CONVINCED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY AS WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE SALARY SAVINGS ARE TEMPORARY AND THEY WON'T BE AVAILABLE ON GOING DCR IS INCREASING THEIR HIRING EFFORTS AND ALSO BE REDUCED- DUE TO THE TWO PERSON CLOSURES THAT ARE THAT ARE FORTHCOMING. AS THESE CHANGES TAKE PLACE IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF THE SALEABLE POSITION- I FEEL SALARY SAVINGS EXCUSE ME TO RE DIRECT TOWARDS THE FOOD BUDGET- SO AND PROPOSAL DESIGNATES. THAT SOME OF SAVINGS AS THE ALLEY ON MY WHICH IS WHY THE REQUEST IS ONLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE FEEDING SPENDING PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTHY MEN YOU KNOW- COMPARED TO THE NEW HEALTHY MENU COSTS. I ALSO I THINK THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULTIES AB. CURRENTLY JUST FILLING POSITIONS DUE TO COVER IT SO AGAIN WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE SALARY SAVINGS WON'T BE AVAILABLE ON GOING. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ON THE A GOING BACK TO THE CANTEEN RESOURCES ASKING FOR- SEVEN MORE POSITIONS OF HOW HOW WOULD YOU HOW DOES THAT WORK. HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHERE IN TERMS OF WORK WHICH INSTITUTIONS THOSE SEVEN POSITIONS WILL WILL GO TO. HI THIS IS ABCS- WE DIDN'T TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE OPERATIONS OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE HAVE DETERMINED WHICH SEVEN THOSE WILL BE- AND THE REASONS THEY WERE CHOSEN WAS BECAUSE ONE OF THE BAG OUT FACILITY THERE'S ONE THAT'S A COMPLETE BACKUP FACILITY AND THERE'S SEVERAL THAT HAVE BACKED OUT YARDS. AND WHEN YOU DO BAG OUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT YOU HAVE TO SEND OUT SHOPPING LIST OF THE HOUSING UNITS GIVEN BACK BAG UP THE ITEMS AND THEN DISTRIBUTE THEM AND THAT REQUIRES LOADING TRUCKS MOVING THEM TO SALLY PORTS AND THEN DISTRIBUTING THOSE ORDERS. BUT I HOPE PROCESS TAKES A LONG TIME SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONSIDERED THE OTHER THING WE CONSIDERED WISE WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMMING IS GOING ON IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING WHICH TAKE THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE OUT INTO PROGRAMMING A MAJORITY OF THE TIME AND SO WE WANT TO WE HAVE TO KEEP THE CANTONS OPEN LONGER AT THOSE FACILITIES. THE ONE THAT CASE WE ALSO NEED MORE STAFF TO RUN THE CANTEENS LONGER FOR THOSE WERE A COUPLE OF THE OTHER AND CONSIDERATION WAS THE TYPE OF INMATE POPULATION AT THE INSTITUTIONS AND IN SOME CASES WE HAVE HERE CAN YOU THIS HENCE OUR PATIENTS. ARE PEOPLE THAT NEED. AND BECAUSE OF THEIR DAY. MENTAL CAME. THAT SHOPPING TAKES A LOT ONE. THEY WERE A LOT MORE ASSISTANCE IN HELPING WITH THEIR ORDERS AT THE WINDOWS. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN ITEMS THAT LOOKED AT TO DETERMINE WHAT. AND INSTITUTIONS WE WOULD BE GIVING US. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES. CENTER NEWMAN I HAVE A WHAT IS PROBABLY REALLY MONDAY CRISIS I I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOP IN A- IN A CANTEEN AND IT IS. AN INSTITUTION SO BACK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE- MARGINS ON SALES SUPPORT THE INMATE WELFARE FUND. HOW DO SHARE PRICES COMPARED TO CANTEEN AGAINST WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE- OUTSIDE WORLD AND HOW ARE THOSE PRICES SET. IN SO HOW THEIR SETS I HAVE TO I CAN PUT SOME THINGS TOGETHER AND GIVE THOSE TO YOU SPECIFICALLY FOR CERTAIN ITEMS THANK OUT OF POCKET BETTER THAN THE CATHOLIC CASTING- AND AS FAR AS THEIR SET WE HAVE A MARKET GOAL THAT WE CHARGE SO FIRST WE GO OUT TO BID ON ON THE FOOD ITEMS THAT WE PURCHASED AND WE HAVE THE STOCK MARKET THAT GOES ON THOSE ITEMS- AND THAT. THE MARKET IS OUR PROFIT. AND THAT IS WHAT YOU TO. NOT ONLY WHAT WE NEED FOR THE COST OF GOODS SOLD- MOSTLY OUR CABLE BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES BENEFITS TO AND MAKES. ANY MONEY THAT WE MAKE. THOSE CURRENTLY- ARE ITEMS SUCH AS WE SUPPORT VISITING I WHEN THEY HAVE A GOOD DAY. WE PROVIDE CABLE- WE PROVIDE MOVIE RENTALS. I WOULD PROVIDE AND LOOK AT LATICS SUPPLIES- AND WE ALSO SUPPORT A LOT OF GRANTS- ARE YOU CAN GET. REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING- AND GET THEM IMPACT SERVICES. IT'S ARE YOU JUST AGAIN MY OWN SORT OF THE BACK. CITY DID SO THERE'S- SAID ON A ON AND IT IS A RISK FOR THE WITH THE SETTING PRICES OR IS IT. KIND OF MORE OF AND TO MAKE THAT HAVE IS WE HAVE A MARK. THAT I REVIEW EVERY YEAR TO IF THE STILL REASONABLE MARKET RATE AND WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY EXPENDITURES THAT WERE HAPPENING AND WHAT OUR SALES ARE- AND ALSO TRYING TO KEEP AND MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE FUND BALANCE IN THE IN A LAW FIRM. SINCE WE DO HOLD THAT AS A TRUST WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES. IT IS REVIEWED ON A FEDERAL BASIS- BASED ON OUR PERFORMANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. INDIVIDUALLY AT CANTEENS AS AS THEIR OWN A STORE AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PROFITABLE AND NOT LOSING MONEY FOR THE- PROJECT SO I GOT A DEGREE WORK FOR ME BUT I DO I DO I THINK. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SEE HOW THOSE PRICES TO COMPARE SO THEY WILL DEFINITELY PROVIDE A LIST OF SOME OF OUR ITEMS ALONG WITH WHAT THE CURRENT SALE PRICE WOULD BE AT. LEAST ONE. THANK YOU MUCH. OKAY THANKS IN CENTER. PRETENDING THANK YOU. THIRTY MINUTES- I. GUESS I'D HAVE TO SAY AT THIS POINT- AND CERTAINLY THERE'S TIME FOR FURTHER STUDY- I DON'T. REALLY UNDERSTAND THE FULL EQUATION BETWEEN- YOU KNOW UNFILLED POSITIONS POSITIONS NEEDED DECLINING OVERALL DECLINING. CENSUS OF POPULATION- IN INCREASING DEMAND BY THE INMATES- ALL LEADING TO THIS. SORT OF NET. POSITION OF- SEVEN POSITIONS I GUESS AND THEN THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION DOLLARS- ANY IT ANY FURTHER. SORT OF BREAKDOWN OF THAT MATH WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME JUST UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD RELATIVE TO THE STATE BUDGET OR- OR EVEN EVEN THIS SUB BUDGET BUT- SOMEBODY MUST'VE DONE THAT ENOUGH ALREADY I'M ASSUMING. YOU KNOW IN THE SPIRIT OF NOT CREATING MOE WORK I JUST LIKE TO SEE- HALL THAT ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION ENDED UP AT THIS AMOUNT. MAY BE A ONE PAGE- GIVE ME US A QUESTION ABOUT- B. WHO JUMP AROUND HERE A LITTLE BIT ON THE INCREASE HEALTHY MENU OPTIONS AWAY I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS IS. THAT THIS. THESE AVERAGES IN TERMS OF HEIGHT WEIGHT AND SO FORTH THAT ARE LAID OUT- I'M PAGES PAGE THIRTEEN OF MY GENDER COULD. THAT THOSE ARE NOT WHAT WE- THOSE ARE NOT THE OUTCOMES WE WANT THOSE OR THE CALORIC LEVEL SO WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN ORDER TO. ACCOMPLISH REDUCED OBESITY AND BETTER HEALTH IS THAT THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY WOULD COME BACK HERE AND SAY THAT THESE ARE BRIDGES ARE. YOU KNOW OUR OUR BETTER BODY WEIGHT INDEX AND WHAT WERE SEEN ON THIS PAGE. YES SIR KEITH ROBINSON CENTER- WHEN WE DETERMINED WHAT THE CATTLE CALORIE LEVEL WOULD BE WE ACTUALLY HAD REACHED OUT TO. CHIEF OF DIETARY REACHED OUT TO SEE WHAT THE AVERAGE WEIGHT. REQUIREMENTS YOU KNOW. OF OUR INMATE POPULATION BOTH MALE AND FEMALE AND WE ONCE WE DETERMINE WHAT THAT WAS. WE FOLLOW THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS PATTERNS IT'S THE WE MODEL BACK. GOOD MEANING YOU MODELED IT WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS YOUR I WAS SITTING HERE HOPING THAT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED CALORIES A DAY. IF I'M READING THIS RIGHT HERE YOU'RE SAYING THE CORK INTAKE RECOMMENDED A COURT CLERK INTAKE IS BASED ON THESE FACTORS YES BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT. EARLIER IN THIS REPORT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WANTING TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF OBESITY. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I DON'T THINK TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED CALORIES A DAY FOR EXAMPLE ON A FIVE FOOT NINE. A MALE WOULD. TYPICALLY SUPPORT. WERE SUSTAIN A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN POUNDS OVER TIME. I'M BEING FIVE FOOT NINE MYSELF ALONE I HAVE SOME LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH THAT BUT- BUT I'M I'M ASSUMING THAT THE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED CALORIES IS INTENDED TO- WITH THIS KIT WITH THESE CHANGES IN THE CNTEEN IN WITH THE SHIP MENU CHANGES IS INTENDED TO- THESE MANAGERS ARE INTENDED TO HIT. A COURT. LEVEL PER DAY THAT THEY BRINGS OF THESE EIGHTS DOWN WHETHER IT'S MALE OR FEMALE THAT'S ALL I'M REALLY ASKING I DON'T I DO TRUST YOU RESEARCH AND I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT WHATSOEVER GEN UNDERSTAND. IF THAT'S THE GOAL YES SIR. OKAY GREAT THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU FOR CONFIRMING THAT IN AND OF. FOR THE ONLY- WE TALKED ABOUT HIM HE WAS GONNA COOPER LEADERS SOMETIME WE HAVE TO VOTE- NOT TODAY BUT- THIS IDEA THAT THESE FUNDS. AN OLD LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS NOT TO USE THE FUNDS I'M GOING BACK TO THE- THE POSITIONS THE MEANWHILE FOR FRONT. POSITIONS BLOOD BUT RATHER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF I'M UNDERSTANDING. RACKLEY IN IN I HEARD IT ON AN INFOPRINT LEAVE- FIRMLY THAT THERE'S A BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY BIG- WOULD IT BE WOULD IT BE. AN ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION TO SAY THAT THAT BACKLOG NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF WITH WITH CAPITAL FUNDS ARE TYPICAL ONE TIME FUNDS TO GET CAUGHT UP- ISN'T IT PERHAPS IS THE MEANWHILE FOR FUN. IT HAS PROVEN TO HAVE A FAILED TO BE INSUFFICIENT. OVER TIME TO TAKE CARE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I JUST WONDERED IF YOU'VE LOOKED AT THAT. ANALYSIS ARE TAKEN UP THAT ANALYSIS OR WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S THAT'S WORTH TAKING UP AS YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THE IN THE MEANWHILE FOR PHONE MAY HAVE. CERTAINLY BEEN INTENDED TO DO THAT- AND HAVE FAILED- NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH UP OR KEEP UP. WITH HIM AGAIN- SO I WILL. I WANT TO BE REDUNDANT BUT YOU HEARD MY SORT OF- SUPPOSE ALL SUPPOSE WE HAD A- YOU KNOW CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS ON A ONE TIME BASIS SEPARATE IN TE FOR A PARTY KEPT CATCH OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE RATHER THAN TRYING TO DEPEND ON THIS FRONT. MOREOVER THE L. A. M. I WOULDN'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON HERE SAID THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING IS ACCESS SEPARATE ISSUE AS WELL AS A MAJOR WELFARE FUND- THAT MONEY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS FOR PAN OPERATIONS POSITIONS WHICH ARE INTENDED FOR MAINTAINING DONTE STARKS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ARE SEPARATE FROM THE- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. FOR THE IS NOW WHAT THE- MEETINGS. AND COMMISSIONER EARLY TO SEE THE STARS IN. TURN OVER TO MICHAEL KAYLA. THANKS I AM KIND AND LOOSE AND ERRORS A POSITION THAT SEEKS ARE BASED AT THE PRESENT THE PLAN OPERATIONS STAFF THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING. THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE PREVENTATIVE- TYPE MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY- AND THEN CDCR HAS THAT SEPARATE BUDGET FOR SPECIAL REPAIRING FOR MAINTENANCE WHICH TENDS TO BE IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES LARGER PROJECTS. THAN A TYPICAL YOU KNOW FIXING A TOILET BUT MORE LIKE REPAIRING A ROOF- IN SO. YOU ARE CORRECT THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AT CDCR INSTITUTIONS THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES IT TO BE AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS- AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS OF KNOWN PROJECTS BUT- THERE'S REASON TO THINK THAT IT'S ACTUALLY IN. SUMMER IN THE SEVERAL BILLION VERY POTENTIALLY HIGHER- SO. AND THERE IS A I BELIEVE THAT IF OUR NEXT HEARING WILL BE DISCUSSING IT MORE ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND A PROPOSAL ONE TIME ALLOCATION FOR- AUGMENTING THE DEPARTMENTS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET- WE DID DO A REPORT LAST YEAR. ON MANAGING BETTER MANAGING PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE IN WHICH WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN- HELP. AS THE STATE DEVELOP A PLAN TO- BETTER MANAGE PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE AND I AM HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF WITH MORE INFORMATION ON THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL. YEAH THAT WOULD ASK A QUESTION- YES FOR NOW THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER FOR NOW I THINK IF YOU COULD JUST DISTRIBUTE I WOULD S. THROUGH THE CHAIR JUST DISTRIBUTE TO THE COMMITTEE- IT'LL LAST YEAR'S- REPORT ANALYSIS IS SOUNDS LIKE BE VERY HELPFUL AND GOOD. FOR US THIS WEEK- APPROACH. A FURTHER HEARINGS ON THE TOPIC IN- IN AGAIN I WOULD JUST LEAVE OUT THERE ANY ANY. UPDATED SUGGESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR- CREATING- A MORE SUSTAINABLE PLAN FOR BOTH. ONGOING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- A BY STAFF AND ALSO THE LARGER CAPITAL FUND CERTAINLY WOULD BE APPRECIATED SO THANK YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE MATERIAL. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR- WE GET EVERYBODY FINANCED LMAO. NO MORE COMMENTS. THE MORE HANDS UP OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE. EIGHT MADAM CHAIRMAN NAMES DOING READER AND I'M WITH CCHS FISCAL SERVICES ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME. YES GO AHEAD. GREAT WE HAVE A REQUEST FOR OUR QUALITY MANAGEMENT SECTION- OF THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND- TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE POSITIONS GROWING TO. ELEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION AND SEVENTY FIVE POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- THESE POSITIONS ARE TO ADDRESS SOME- PATIENT SAFETY CONCERNS- WE HAD AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF OUR PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM DONE BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO- THE DEFINITION FROM ACCIDENTAL OR PREVENTABLE INJURIES PRODUCED BY MEDICAL CARE- SO. WE HAVE SOME DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED I HAVE A NET LAMBERT- THE DIRECTOR WORKING ON PROGRAMMING DR JOHN DUNLAP FROM WORKING ON PROGRAM HERE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT- THESE POSITIONS ARE TO- AT SOME POSITIONS TO OUR QUALITY MANAGEMENT SECTION UNITS IN THE INSTITUTIONS TO ADDRESS PATIENT. SAFETY CONCERNS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. OKAY- THE FINANCE. THIS IS MICHAEL PLACEMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STUFF AND AT THIS TIME OKAY AND THE ALEJO. R. O. L. L. WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT PROPOSAL OVER ALL HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT- THAT NUMBER POSITION YOURS DO YOU NEED TO BE ADJUSTED THE SOMETHING WE HAE DISCUSSED WITH ADMINISTRATION THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED. SO I DON'T HAVE NOTE FROM THE RECEIVERS OFFICER NOTED THAT- THAT NUMBER POSITIONS WOULD GROW OVER TIME AND THE WAY THIS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED AS EACH PERSON WOULD GET TO POSITION ALLOCATED. AND THE STYLO THREE ARMS IN TERMS OF WHICH PERSONS GOT THOSE POSITIONS. ANKARA THIS WILL BE TAKEN ALTHOUGH FIVE PRESIDENTS HARM THAT MINISTRATION HAS. PLANS TO CLOSE TO PRISONS INCLUDING THE DUAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN TWENTY ONE POINT TUNE. BUT THESE POSITIONS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THOSE CLOSURES AND SO THAT THOSE CLOSE PRISON FACILITY ALLOCATED POSITIONS. THE PROPOSAL SHOULD BE REDUCED FIGHT FOR POSITIONS AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. ANNUALLY ALPHEUS. OKAY. ANNETTE MISS LAMBERT LEFT. THE COMPANY AND I AM NOT LAMBERT DEPUTY DIRECTOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND PATIENT SAFETY CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES GO AHEAD OKAY- AS AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR READER EXPLAINED AS THE RECEIVER HAD COMMISSION OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS SOME INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES THAT WERE STILL OUTSTANDING FOR THE RECEIVERSHIP SO THESE ARE ISSUES THAT- STILL NEED TO BE TACKLED FOR US TO BE RELEASED FROM FEDERAL RECEIVERSHIP AND FOR OUR SYSTEM TO BE DELEGATED BACK TO YOU AS STATE CONTROL. ONE OF THOSE AREAS IS PATIENT SAFETY AND SO M. AS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR READER EXPLAINED THE UC SAN FRANCISCO AND WAS. ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ASSESSMENT OVER PATIENT SAFETY AS SYSTEM AT OUR THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS ARE YOU SOUNDS GOOD COMPLETED THAT REVIEW AND FOUND THAT WE HAD- SOME SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN OUR PATIENTS SAFETY. SYSTEM AND THEY ALSO FOUND THAT WE WERE UNDERSTAFFED BOTH TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICES AS WELL AS ADDRESSING THE GAPS IDENTIFIED. AS SO THIS REQUEST IS TO ALLOW US TO PUT INTO PLACE SOME OF THOSE SYSTEMS AT CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT UCSF. I'M IDENTIFIED AS MISSING AND ARE AM SYSTEM. AND WHAT WE ALSO DID IS WE TRIED TO LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING STAFFING MODELS SO YOU CASF HAD RECOMMENDED A MUCH RICHER AND PROPOSAL. FOR STASHING AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE SOME OF OUR EXISTING CLINICAL STAFF IT REDUCES THE BURDEN ON AT. ON THE GENERAL FUND AND TAXPAYERS SO WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO REALLY AND- MAKE THAT AS STREAMLINED AS POSSIBLE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE USING OUR EXISTING. RESOURCES WITHIN THE DIVISION. AND BEYOND THIS EVALUATION BY UC SAN FRANCISCO WE HAD ALREADY SEEN AS SOME ISSUES WITH OUR STAFFING MODEL AND THIS IS A MODEL THAT WE HAD PUT TOGETHER IN JULY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN IT ESTABLISHES EIGHT A UNIT OF STAFF WHO ARE DEDICATED TO QUALITY MANAGEMENT PATIENT SAFETY WITHIN EACH PRESENT. AND WE USED EXISTING RESOURCES TO PUT THIS UNIT TOGETHER AND WHAT WE FOUND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DID OUR OWN INTERNAL ASSESSMENTS IS THAT WE HAD SOME SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE LEVEL OF RESOURCING OF FOR OUR STAFFING SOME SOME STAFF THAT WE- BELIEVE COULD BE FULLY DEDICATED TO YOU QUALITY MANAGEMENT WE ACTUALLY WERE UNABLE TO FULLY. RE DIRECT THEM TO Q. M. AND THEY WERE AND THESE ARE STAFF PARTICULAR THEY WERE PULLED FOR DENTAL FUNCTIONS. SO THIS PROPOSAL MAKES THOSE POSITIONS HOLE AND IT ALLOWS FOR A SOLID STAFFING STRUCTURE FOR OUR THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS ARE M. AS LA POINT ELLIE- POINTED OUT THE- WITH THE CLOSURE OF SOME PRISONS AS- ULTIMATELY THIRTY THREE PRESENTS. I GUESS I'M A SOLID THE STAFFING STRUCTURE FOR THEIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND PATIENT SAFETY AT PROGRAMS IN ADDITION THIS AT THIS REQUEST SETS UP A SMALL UNIT OF ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS EXPERTS. WHICH WE WERE DEPLOYED FROM HEADQUARTERS TO ASSIST INSTITUTIONS AND AS IN PERFORMING THOROUGH INCREDIBLE- CAUSING GALAXIES WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR PATIENTS SAFETY AT PROGRAM. THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND PATIENT SAFETY A PROGRAM WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. THIS IS THE SYSTEM WE USE FOR ROUTINE MONITORING OF OUR ALL OF OUR MAJOR HEALTH CARE AT PROCESSES SO ALL OF OUR CRITICAL HEALTHCARE PROCESSES ALL OVER CRITICAL PATIENT OUTCOMES. THIS IS THE SYSTEM FOR ROUTINE MONITORING OF OUR SYSTEM AS WELL AS I. YOUR TIGHTENING THAT THOSE QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT ARE IDENTIFYING AT THAT ARE IDENTIFIED ADDRESSING THEM THROUGH NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED IMPROVEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS LEAN SIX SIGMA SUCH AS ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. AND ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS. THIS IS CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION AND WE REALLY NEED FOR THIS TO BE AS STRONG FULLY FUNCTIONAL AT PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS AND TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANY OTHER- COMMENTS WE DON'T HAVE. COLLEAGUES NOTHING OKAY I'M NOT MISSING ALL RIGHT OF WELL WE'RE GONNA HOLD OPEN APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK- ON THIS AND- WE'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE. THAT'S THE LAST ONE OKAY. OKAY ISSUE NINE ALMOST DONE. THIS IS OUR FINAL ISSUE ON THE AGENDA ITS REQUEST FOR RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT ANOTHER BILL PASSED LAST YEAR WHICH WAS SB ONE THIRTY TWO HAD TO DO WAS TRANSGENDER NINE NON BINARY AND INTERSEX INMATE HOUSING AND SEARCH PREFERENCES OR QUESTIONS FOR TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND AND FIVE POINT FIVE POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT FACILITATE SAFE HOUSING FOR THE TRANSGENDER POPULATION AND HOUSE TRANSGENDER INMATES BASED ON THEIR GENDER IDENTITY- WITH ME TODAY AS SHE CAPTAIN SHANNON STARK CORRECTIONAL ADMINISTRATOR DAN ROSS AND BEEN BLIND AND WHOSE ARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANNER MANAGER I'D LIKE TO TURN TO- CAPTAIN STARK FIRST WE COULD TO TALK ABOUT- THE REASON BEHIND. THIS PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS- I'M CAPTAIN SHANNON STARK AND- SO EVEN PRIOR TO S. B. ONE THIRTY TO BE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR- THE DEPARTMENT- ESTABLISH A WORK GROUP TO LOOK AT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO THIS POPULATION. I'M RECOGNIZING THAT- THAT THEY ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR VICTIMIZATION THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE ADDITIONAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. IN HOUSING ALAN'S AND PROGRAMMING- SO IT WOULDN'T SB ONE THIRTY TWO WAS WAS SIGNED- IT ACTUALLY EXPANDED UPON SOME OF OUR EXISTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND THEN REQUIRED- ADDITIONAL- US TO DROP THE DIGITAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGULATIONS- TO WORK TOWARDS COMPLIANCE FROM NESTING ONE THIRTY TWO. SB ONE THIRTY TWO AND THE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT OVERLAP IN MANY AREAS- ONE SIGNIFICANT AREA IS IN THE HOUSING PLACEMENT FOR TRANS GENDER NON BINARY AND INTERSEX INMATE POPULATION. SO WHERE PRIA REQUIRES THAT WE DO A CASE BY CASE REVIEW SB ONE THIRTY TWO EXPANDS ON THIS AND REQUIRES THAT NOT ONLY DO WE DO A CASE BY CASE REVIEW. THAT WE ASK EVERY INMATE WHO COMES OUR CURRENT POPULATION AND EVERYBODY WHO COMES INTO YOUR- CDCR ABOUT THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AND THEN IF THEY DO IDENTIFY AS TRANS GENDER NON BINARY OR INTERSEX. BUT WE ALSO ASK THEM IF THEY'D LIKE TO DESIGNATE TOWARDS SELECT A SEARCH PREFERENCE REQUEST NOT BEING- THE GENDER OF THE STAFF MEMBER THEY'LL BE SEARCHING THEM. AND THEN ALSO THEY WOULD LIKE TO CHOOSE TO BE- HOUSE OF A MALE OR FEMALE FACILITY SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE WORKED WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS OVER AT THE ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SERVICES- TO DEVELOP AN ELECTRONIC FORM WHERE WE CAN- THAT GUIDES OUR STAFF. TO ASK INMATES ABOUT THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AND THEN ALSO TO CAPTURE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR SEARCH PREFERENCE REQUEST AND. THEN ALSO ABOUT THEIR HOUSING REQUEST. I THE SEARCH PREFERENCE FOR. PIECES OF NEW- A WHOLE NEW. PROCESS FOR. ARE ALLOWING ENEMY SEARCH SELECT THE GENDER OF THE STAFF MEMBER THAT WILL BE SEARCHING THEM IS NOW- AND REQUIRED A LOT OF WORK AND- ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT. OF TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF- ADDITIONALLY- WE HAVE RIGHT WHEN SB ONE THIRD SHE WAS FINE BUT PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION WE DID DEVELOP STOP ARE DEVELOPED. I'M TRAINING WITH- STAFF OVERSEE POST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO- TRAIN ALL KINDS TO DO STUFF ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB ONE THIRTY TWO SO THAT WAS COMPLETED AND WE REALLY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING WITH IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB ONE THIRTY TWO. SO I THINK THAT THE OUTSIDE OVERVIEW OF KIND OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IF THERE'S ANY- ANY QUESTIONS. WELL I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT- HARD WORK IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND- THOROUGH AND ANTICIPATING. YOU KNOW THAT THIS OVERLAP THAT YOU THAT YOU JUST EXPLAINED AND PUT OUT THERE SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A FOR THAT WORK- LOL. WE DIDN'T RAISE CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL OKAY. OKAY NUMBER COMMENTS FROM FINANCE COLLEAGUES YES SENATOR NEWMAN. QUESTION ON THE AMOUNT- SO- ONE SP ONE THIRTY TWO WENT THROUGH- THE ANALYSIS ASSUMED IT ONE TIME COST BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR AN UPDATE- OF THE SOUND SYSTEM AND THEN ONE TIME QUESTION THE LOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SO WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE VARIANCE HERE BETWEEN THE EXPECTED COST. AND THE REAL COST OF IN THE END IT IS NOT ABOUT BLAME IT'S ABOUT HOW CAN WE ANTICIPATE THESE THINGS BETTER IN THE FUTURE. RIGHT. GOOD FOR CAPTAIN STARTED SHE'S REAL. I THINK ABOUT ORIGINAL ANALYSIS WAS REALLY JUST BASED ON ALL WHAT WE BELIEVE- WE NEED TO DO TO YOUR EMPLOYMENT. WHY SB ONE THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD- WAS REQUIRING BUT AS WE WORKED WITH- YEAH WE CAN SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND ALSO WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT WE REALIZED BUT THAT REALLY WASN'T SUFFICIENT OR MEANINGFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL SO THAT OUR TRANSGENDER INTERSEX NON BINARY POPULATION- IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB ONE THIRTY TWO THIRDS OTHER PLACE THAT'S ANOTHER PIZZA- THAT. THAT WE NEED TO TOUCH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- REALLY HAVE A GOOD POLICY PRACTICE THE PLANES JUNE STATE RETELLS SEARCH- I'M RECOGNIZE. THIS POPULATIONS GENDER IDENTITY. AND- IT WHEN WE REALLY GOT DOWN TO THE WORK BEHIND IT AND WORK THROUGH ALL OF THESE PROCESSES LESSON PLANS THAT NEED TO BE DEVELOPED ADDITIONAL TRAINING THAT NEEDS TO BE. DEVELOPED CULTURAL AWARENESS OR MORE INFORMATION FOR OUR STAFF ON TRANSGENDER NON BINARY RESPECTFUL WHAT THAT EVEN MEANS YOU KNOW- WE REALLY. THEN WERE ABLE TO- GET OUT OF BETTER COSTS THE BETTER LOOK BETTER FOR POSITION. TO SUPPORT WHAT WE NEED TO DEAL. SURE I GUESS IS FOLLOW UP WITHOUT GETTING TOO DEEP INTO THIS IS WOULD YOU SAY. THAT YOU COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER CONSULTED AS THE LEGISLATION WAS GOING THROUGH I MEAN I'M GONNA SORT OF LOOKING FOR LESSONS. TO LEARN HERE- SO THAT BECAUSE THAT THE MULTIPLES ACTUALLY QUITE HIGH IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS ESTIMATED THE TIME IN WHAT IS CLEARLY GOING TO COST. ALL MY SHARON I CAN JUMP INTO ON THE OTHER COSTS FOR SONGS. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR- THIS IS AN BINDING FROM C. C. R. I. RUN THE STRATEGIC OF VENDOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- WEDNESDAY- THE INITIAL ASKED HIM AND I WAS PROVIDED DETAILS IN TERMS OF JUST PROVIDING A GENDER IDENTITY QUESTIONNAIRE AND ONE OF OUR SYSTEMS- THE ELECTRONIC RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- AND THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED- AT THE FIRST OF THE YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT AND SHANNON HAD MENTIONED- TO MAKE SURE THAT QUESTION NEVER GOT IN. UNDER THE AUSPICES OF BOTH SB ONE THIRTY TWO AND- THE PRE- IMPLEMENTATION AS CAPTAIN STARK AND ALSO MENTIONED THE WORK GROUP THAT HAD BEEN- WORKING ON FOR YEARS I HAD STAFF MEMBERS ON THAT WORK GROUP IS WELL AS SOME OF MY- TECHNICAL EXPERTS IN THE IN THE FIELD OF. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOFTWARE ITSELF I'M COMING UP WITH REQUIREMENTS- NOT UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR WERE THE REQUIREMENTS PUT FORTH IN TERMS OF- BEING ABLE TO PUT A GENDER IDENTITY QUALIFIER INTO THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE PRONOUNS AND HONORIFICS THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE. CURRENTLY THE STRATEGIC UNDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY THE BEHEMOTH OF MANAGING ON THE OFFENDER MANAGEMENT WITHIN CCR ACROSS THE STATE CURRENTLY ONLY HAS THE GENDER IDENTITY OF MALE OR FEMALE. SB ONE THIRTY TWO AND- DECEMBER WE ADDED THE GENDER IENTITY FIELD THAT WOULD- ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY THE OFFENDER OR THE INMATE AS EITHER MALE FEMALE OR NON BINARY. AND THERE'S MULTIPLE PHASES THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO WE HAVE- NOT ONLY NEED TO UPDATE WHICH IS A HUGE APPLICATION WE ADDED THAT THE FIRST GENDER IDENTITY QUALIFIER ONE SCREEN. WE HAVE TO ALSO HAVE THAT ON MULTIPLE SCREENS ABOUT SEVENTY SCREENS AND THE REASON WE NEED TO DO THIS IS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT STAFF USED THE AND MAKE PREFERRED PRONOUNS AND HONORIFICS CORRECTLY AND THEY'RE NOT. WE DON'T HAVE GENDER ON. ONE SCREEN VERSES THE GENDER IDENTITY ARE NOT. THERE'S AND THEN DOWNSTREAM HAVE OTHER APPLE. ARE USED BY CASTING STAFF THAT. INFORMATION FROM. SUCH AS THE- TO YOU AND THERE'S SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE THEM PULL THE GENDER IDENTITY QUALIFIER AS WELL SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA SAID WE DON'T HAVE ONE SYSTEM SAYING MALE FEMALE AND THE OTHER SYSTEM SAYING. MALE FEMALE OR- FOR NON BINARY SO. THAT WAS REALLY THE INCREASE OF THE COST TO THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS WE HAVE ABOUT SIX PRETTY LARGE APPLICATIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES TO. AS WELL AS THE OTHER ITEM THE CAPTAIN STARK MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE- THE HOUSING AND THE OTHER SEARCH PREFERENCES A WHOLLY DIFFERENT PROCESS. THAT WILL INCLUDE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT FUNCTION WITHIN SONGS HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS.
