BEEN PROVIDED IN TERMS OF THE

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:15.293
PENETRATION OF VACCINATION- IS

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.162
CERTAINLY FAR BELOW 1100% IS A

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:19.397
IS A RECALL. EMPLOYEES WERE

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:22.500
HOVERING AROUND. THE 70% RANGE

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:23.268
INMATES WERE A LITTLE BIT

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:24.769
HIGHER. BACK TO THE

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:26.571
ACCOUNTABILITY QUESTION I WAS

ADOPTED SO THE QUESTION IS THIS

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.031
- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:55.733

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.670

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:05.543
ANYWHERE NEAR A 100% WOULDN'T

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.114
MITIGATE- THE NEED TO MAKE THESE

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.448
CURRENT INVESTMENTS THIS

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:11.716

DOES ANYBODY. HAVE ANY METRICS

00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:20.024
ON THAT AS TO. HOW MUCH WE COULD

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:23.394
REDUCE BUT IN OUR OUR OUR

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.430
BUDGETARY COST HERE- BY SIMPLY

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:26.798

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.762
PHARMACY OR WHATEVER THAT'S FINE

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.797
BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF OTHER

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:07.298
FAMILIES WHO DON'T FEEL

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:08.699
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT SO- SO

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:09.834
HOPEFULLY WE'RE REALLY LOOKING

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:12.003
AT THAT- THE OTHER QUESTION I

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:15.773
HAVE. IS- A NOTE THAT- IS ABOUT

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.542

MILLION SO. IS ROUNDING UP A

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:20.912
LITTLE BIT. FOR STATEWIDE

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:23.281
TESTING. AND I GUESS THIS

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:25.983
QUESTION IS RELATED TO- ELSE

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.519
CERTAINLY SCHOOLS HAVE TO DO ARE

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:30.655
YOU KNOW. DOING A LOT OF TESTING

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:33.925
TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN- AND- I

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.626
UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'S FEDERAL

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:37.228
FUNDING THAT WENT TO THE

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:40.364
SCHOOLS. THROUGH THE AMERICAN

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:42.433

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.635
FUNDING- ACTUALLY EXPIRES IN

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.137

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.710
DRESS IN THE MAIN BUDGET. BUT I

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:55.446
AM CURIOUS AS TO- IN TERMS OF

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:57.448
FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS WHETHER ANY

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.450

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:01.559
VERY IMPORTANT FORUM FOR OUR

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:04.428
STATE- AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:08.732
OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE-

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.534

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.778
FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT THEY WOULD

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:37.648
BE TAX BECAUSE OF. ON TOP OF

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:40.884
THAT THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS- THIS

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:43.687
BILL BASICALLY LEAVES A GAP- AND

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:47.291
THE GAP IS BETWEEN MARCH. OF

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.159

THAT FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.746
EXTENDED THEIR PROGRAM AND SO

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.080
WE'VE LEFT THE GAP BECAUSE OF

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:12.016
THIS BILL AND I JUST WANT TO

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.684
IDENTIFY IT- WE NEED TO DO

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:15.152
SOMETHING TO FIX IT BECAUSE

REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO

SEVEN METERN INSTEAD I THINK

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.502
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE- THE

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:14.204

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:46.303
DOESN'T INCLUDE AN APPROPRIATION

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.139
WHEN WILL THAT APPROPRIATIONS BE

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:58.515

ISN'T AN APPROPRIATION REQUIRED

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:37.988
AT THIS MOMENT- I JUST WANT TO

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.156
HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT WE

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:41.858
CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE TO THE

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.760
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL REALLOCATED FUNDS

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.231
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. IT'S A

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:51.235
FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM THAT-ABOUT- THAT WAS CREATED AS PART

00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:54.071
OF- FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGES

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:56.673

LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LOCAL

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.655
LEVEL SO THAT CALIFORNIANS

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.557
ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS CAN

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:16.460
CONTINUE TO PURSUE PAYMENT. WELL

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:18.895
YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS.

WHAT ASSURANCE DO WE HAVE THAT

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:22.866
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:25.602
TO COME THROUGH WITH ANY FUNDING

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.038
I DON'T THINK WE DO WHERE YOU'RE

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.506
MAKING GROSS ASSUMPTIONS HERE.

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.575
AND THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:34.011
FEDERAL MONEY. WHO IS A BLIGE OF

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.846
THAT FEDERAL MONEY DOES NOT COME

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:37.180
TO COVER THE LOANS THAT THE

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:38.849
STATE HAS PROVIDED WHERE WILL

00:48:38.915 --> 00:48:41.652
THAT MONEY COME FROM. AGAIN THIS

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:43.954
IS A CASH FLOW LOAN TO BRIDGE

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.090
THAT WE CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH-

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:49.926
THE TREASURY WE HAVE- A MULTI

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:52.429
STATE LETTER. TO FOR THEIR

TWO U. S. SENATORS- SO WE ARE

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:58.402
PUSHING AGGRESSIVELY FOR.

00:48:58.468 --> 00:49:00.604
THROUGH A FEDERAL ADVOCACY FOR

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:03.340
THOSE FUNDS. WELL IT'S A PART OF

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:04.408
THE GAMESMANSHIP THAT DOES

00:49:04.474 --> 00:49:07.711
BECOME RAMPANT NOW IN OUR BUDGET

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.347

OVER MANY YEARS. IT'S JUST THAT

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:17.020
I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF IT

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:18.522
. THE BILL SAYS THAT THE BEST

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:20.624
GENERAL WOULD NOT COUNT AS A

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:23.427
GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. BUT

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:25.228
WE'VE GOT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:28.332
THE DRESS CARE. WE MIGHT NOT GET

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:31.368
IT BACK. CAN'T THAT MAKE MUCH

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:32.969

THE GROUND THE BEGAN LIMIT OR

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:38.809
SOMETHING IS THAT WHAT THE

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:41.211
ADMINISTRATION'S TRYING TO DO

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:44.581
SKATE THE GAMUT. NO SENATOR- IT

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.149
BECAUSE IT IS A CASH ALONE IT IS

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:48.085
NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATIONS

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:49.853
SAID THAT LONG BEFORE GIVEN IN

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.922
THE FUTURE THAT THE ALLOCATION

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:54.891
WOULD OCCUR AT THAT TIME. PLEASE

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:57.027
DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS IS A

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:59.029
PERSONAL ONE IN ANY WAY. AND

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.731
THAT'S HAPPENED OVER MANY YEARS

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:02.299
AND I'VE PROBABLY HAD TO DEAL

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.967
WITH MORE THAN MOST BECAUSE I'VE

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.802
BEEN HERE A LOT OF YEARS. BUT

00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.437
I'M GETTING WARY OF IT. AND I

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.106

SOME OF THESE EMERGENCY POWERS

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:26.890
GOING TO BE EXTINGUISHED IF THE-

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.258
VILLA SHOWS THE GOVERNOR

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:31.328
CONTINUES HE EMERGENCY POWERS.

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:33.430
THAT COULD EXTEND INTO THE

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.665
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THAT'S A

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:38.368

EMERGENCY AUTHORITY THERE'S A

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:48.111
AND WHAT IS HIS PLAN. YEAH I

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:49.379
WOULD JUST POINT TO THE FACT

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.814
THAT WE ARE COMING TO THE

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.382
LEGISLATURE FOR EARLY ACTION ON

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:54.951
KOBE IT AS AN EXAMPLE WELL WHICH

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:58.855
WAS- BUT INITIALLY WE HAD A

00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:00.957
FORTY THROUGH- STATUTE THROUGH

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:03.960
JERRY ELLIS STATUTES TO. SPEND

AND OUT OF THE- AS OF THE U. WE

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:08.999
FIVE NO LONGER HAVE THAT

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.400
AUTHORITY NO LONGER THE

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.135
FLEXIBILITY TO USE THAT TRIO UP

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:14.237
FRONT AND SO AS AN EXAMPLE WE

00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:15.672
ARE COMING BEFORE. THE

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.107
LEGISLATURE TO THE LEGISLATIVE

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:18.475
PROCESS TO ASK FOR THOSE

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.677
ADDITIONAL FINES- THROUGH THE

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:23.413
CONTROL SECTION WE ALSO HAVE- A

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.182
MEASURE OF AN ABILITY TO THE

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.416
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE HAVE A

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:28.618
TEN DAY NOTIFICATION TO THE GLVC

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:30.187
BEFORE WE CAN EXPAND THE SPOT.

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:31.721
SO JUST TO POINT OUT SOME OF

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:36.359
THAT. THE BALANCE THERE. WE FORM

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:38.728

FOR BRINGS FOR. THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:45.202
. THE KOBE REQUEST RELATED THAT

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:47.270
WOULD BE THROUGH A JAIL LET. AND

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:49.773
SO THAT WOULD BE A EDUCATION

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.576
STUDER- THE FIRE TO THE

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:53.543
EXPENDITURE OF A OF THOSE FINE

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.246
FOR WHICH WERE OUT FOR- IN THE

00:51:56.313 --> 00:52:01.651
IN CURRENT YEAR. WELL THE GUN

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.687
SEEMS TO HAVE A- PENSION FOR

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:06.256

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.411
DID WANT TO NOTE ONE KEY THING

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:22.979
IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET BILL

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:25.014
JUNIOR THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.449
EXPENDITURES AND THEIR RELATED

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:29.485
TO COPE IT. THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:32.388
HAVE GONE THROUGH THE JAIL BC-

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:35.358
PROCESS HOWEVER AS THE

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:38.161
LEGISLATURE WE AND BOTH HOUSES

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.563
WE BASICALLY SAID NO THEY SHOULD

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.165
GO THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.800
THEY SHOULD HAVE A HEARING SUCH

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:46.002
AS THIS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.104
BE VETTED BY OUR LEGISLATIVE

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.605
COLLEAGUES ARE STAFF AND OF

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.340
COURSE THE PUBLIC AND THAT IS

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:53.342
WHY. WE HAVE THE BEFORE US AND

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.977
WHY WE HAVE THIS HEARING BUT

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:58.548
WHAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT IN

01:01:58.614 --> 01:01:59.916
RELATIONSHIP TO A STATE OF

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:04.320
EMERGENCY. WE ARE CURRENTLY AT.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:08.958
OR IT.PER DAY. COVERT DATA AS-

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:12.361
AS WE DID A YEAR AGO. SO FOR

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:15.465
ANYONE TO IMAGINE THAT WE ARE

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.333
NOT IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.368
STILL FROM THIS PANDEMIC WHILE

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.437
WE ARE ALL TIRED OF IT AND I

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.940
APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE STILL IN

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.775
A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WE

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:29.879
HAVE. AS I SAID. THAT WERE ABOVE

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:33.282
THE NUMBER OF DEATHS PER DAY IN

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.184
THE STATE AS WE DID A YEAR AGO.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.521
SO I THINK ALL OF US WANT TO

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.656
MAKE SURE THAT OUR WE CONTINUE

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:43.259
TO BE AS SMART. AROUND OUR

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.660
PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOLS TO

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:47.130
MINIMIZE THOSE DEATHS AND WE

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:49.031
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.501
SUPPORT WHETHER IT'S BUSINESSES

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.870
ARE STATE AGENCIES ARE PUBLIC

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:54.971
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OR WHAT HAVE

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:58.975
YOU. AND IN RELATIONSHIP TO-

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:02.245
FUNDING FOR SUCH THINGS AS CDCR

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:05.715
WHILE I WOULD- HOPE THAT WE GOT

01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:08.184
TO THE POINT. IF WE LOOK AT FOR

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.986
EXAMPLE THE U. S. MILITARY

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.855
WHERE- THERE'S NOW CONSEQUENCES

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:15.291
TO THOSE- MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:18.027
VACCINATED. THAT WE MIGHT GET TO

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:21.330
SUCH ACIRCUMSTANCE IN OUR OWN

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:22.899
AMONGST MANY OF OUR OWN STAFF

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.667
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT SERVE

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.669
CONGREGATE SETTINGS BECAUSE

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:29.405
UNFORTUNATELY. THEY ARE PUTTING

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:35.044
THE. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.713
ADDRESS BUT WE ARE IN THIS CASE

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.882
ADDRESSING IT WITH TESTING AND

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.752
CONTINUED- PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:46.289
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT ALSO AND

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:49.926
THEN I WANTED TO ADD ON THE-

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:52.028
ISSUES OF THE ASSISTANT STORE

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.430
LANDLORDS IN OUR TENANTS. IT IS

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.400
YOUR ACCURATE THAT THE WE ARE

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:59.435
NOT GUARANTEED THAT WE WILL

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.370
RECEIVE THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.239
WE HOPE HOWEVER THE FEDERAL

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:05.341
GOVERNMENT. HAS MADE IT CLEAR

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.443
BOTH IN THE INITIATION OF THE

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.713
PROGRAM AND SUBSEQUENTLY THAT.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.515
IN THEY MADE AN INITIAL

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.884
ALLOCATION TO STATES BUT THAT

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.153
THEY WOULD BE SWEEPING THE

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.788
UNSPENT MONEY FOR MANY STATES

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:20.356
WHO DID NOT SPEND THEIR MONEY

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:22.291
AND RE ALLOCATING AND WE ALREADY

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.026
KNOW IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.361
PUBLICLY THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.129
OF STATES A GOOD NUMBER THAT DID

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.565
NOT SPEND THEIR FULL AMOUNTS OR

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:32.001
SOME CASE VERY LITTLE. AND THE

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:33.236
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.805
BE REDISTRIBUTING THAT AND GIVEN

01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:37.940
THE NUMBER OF THE LANDLORDS AND

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:38.941
TENANTS IN THE STATE OF

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.577
CALIFORNIA WHO QUALIFY FOR THAT

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.012
PROGRAM IN WHO HAVE SUBMITTED

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:45.648
APPLICATIONS WE NEED TO DO OUR

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:49.151
VERY VERY BEST. TO PURSUE

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.486
GETTING THAT MONEY FROM THE

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:51.954
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:54.657
THAT BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED TO

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:55.992
SEE EITHER OUR SMALL SMALL

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:58.594
LANDLORDS HURT. DUE TO LACK OF

01:04:58.661 --> 01:04:59.962
THE ABILITY OF THEIR TENANTS TO

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.465
PAY NOR DO WE NEED TO SEE A LOT

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:05.401
OF EVICTIONS OCCUR. ON AT SOME

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:07.603
POINT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.705
ALREADY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:10.873
AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THE

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.143
STATE. SO I WANTED TO MAKE JUST

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.745
A COUPLE OF THOSE POINTS I HAD

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.246
SOME OTHERS I WANTED TO MAKE

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:21.250
AROUND SMALL BUSINESSES- BUT I-

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:23.886
BECAUSE I DO NOTE- SENATOR DRUGS

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:26.322
IS CONCERNED THAT. WHILE IT I

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:28.924
THINK WE HAD IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:30.793
AROUND MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS NOT

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.994
JUST THE ONES THAT ARE BEFORE US

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:33.996
TODAY WE OFTEN EXEMPT THE SMALL

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:36.432
EMPLOYERS. FROM BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.200
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE KIND

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.169
OF REVENUE IN GENERAL THAT LARGE

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:42.972
EMPLOYERS HAVE AND SO. THEY HAVE

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.874
LESS ABILITY PERHAPS TO COVER

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.910
THE TYPES OF COSTS THAT MAY BE

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.445
INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.647
OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS HOWEVER WE

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:52.882
ALSO KNOW THAT A VERY LARGE

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:54.650
PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS DO ARE

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:56.419
EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.387
AND THEY NEED THE ASSISTANCE

01:05:58.454 --> 01:05:59.655
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:01.857
PAID SICK LEAVE TO AND YET IN

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.759
THIS CASE WERE NOT NECESSARILY

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.995
MANDATING IT BUT- WE ALSO KNOW

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.096
THAT MANY OF OUR SMALL

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:08.764
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN THE MOST

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.534
HARDEST HIT. BY THE ECONOMIC

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.569
REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS PANDEMIC

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.173
SO ARE WHILE OUR AND DO ACTIONS

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:18.741
BEFORE US INCLUDE A HUNDRED AND

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.710
FIFTY MILLION MORE. FOR THE

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.611
GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES WE

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:24.313
MAY WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.215
VERY TARGETED PROGRAMS WE MIGHT

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.184
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. TO ASSESS

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.686
BOTH THE EMPLOYEES AND OF SMALL

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:31.787
BUSINESS AND THE SMALL

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.989
BUSINESSES THEMSELVES AND WE'RE

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:35.658
TALKING NOW THE VERY SMALL ONES.

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.893
MEANING THE TWENTY FIVE OR LESS.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.961
THAT IN MANY CASES WE'VE

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.896
ACCEPTED FROM THINGS BUT IT IS

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:42.398
SOMETHING WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.899
SINCE THE DATA SHOWS THAT

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:45.234
THERE'D BEEN SOME OF THE HARDEST

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:48.871
HIT. SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:49.905
THAT CLEARLY YOU'RE ALL OF VIEW

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:50.973
HAVE START THE BUDGET SEPT

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.874
HEARINGS YOU'RE DEALING WITH

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:54.110
LOTS OF THESE. ISSUES AND

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:56.011
TODAY'S JUST NEARLY ACTIONS BUT

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:58.681
I WILL BE QUIET NOW. AND

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.116
RECOGNIZE SENATOR COM MARKER

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:01.917
FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY AND

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:03.786
THEN WE WILL GO TO THE PUBLIC

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.621
COMMENT GO AHEAD CENTER COMPLEX.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.858
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AM I. IN

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:11.260
THANK YOU FOR THOSE. COMMENTS

THAT YOU SHARED WITH US. I TOO

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:16.499
WILL BE- SUPPORTING THE- ITEMS

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:19.902
BEFORE US WHEN IT IS TIME- FOR

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:24.507
THE VOTES- LATER ON. THEY LATER

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:27.343
ON I WANTED TO JUST SORT OF GO

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.244
BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.546
MADE BY DR PAN ABOUT. IN NEW

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:31.781
ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW WE'VE HIT A

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:35.084
WALL- WITH VACCINATION RATES BUT

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.585
WE'VE HIT A WALL FOR A NUMBER OF

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:40.289
REASONS- AND- ONE OF THE REASONS

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:42.091
WHY WE'VE HAD A WALL IS BECAUSE

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.526
PEOPLE ARE TIRED. YOU KNOW

01:07:43.592 --> 01:07:45.995
PATIENTS AND WORKERS AND

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:48.931
FAMILIES ARE BURNED OUT THEY'RE

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:52.101
OVERWHELMED THEY ARE TIRED. AND

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:53.869
SO IT IS GREAT THAT WE ARE

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:56.372
PUTTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS INTO

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.674
YOU KNOW TESTING AN OUT REACH

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.976
AND BOOSTERS AND EQUIPMENT IT IS

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:04.113
GREAT THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING ARM

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.449
PAID SICK LEAVE. I ALSO HOPE

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:08.284
THAT WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.519
ECONOMIC RELIEF WE RECOGNIZE

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.221
THAT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:14.156
TRANSLATING INTO PSYCHOLOGICAL.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.126
RELIEF IF PEOPLE ARE BURNED OUT

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:17.960
IF THEY ARE DEALING WITH

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:20.296
DEPRESSION IF THEY ARE CHECKING

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.565
OUT IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. THEN

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.099
WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.935
CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE GOING TO

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.303
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OF HOW TO

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:29.171
FACE. AS IT RELATES TO HOW SMALL

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.806
BUSINESSES STAY OPEN HOW IT

01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:32.174
RELATES TO WORKERS WANTING TO

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:34.410
SHOW UP AND GO TO WORK AS IT

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:35.044
RELATES TO YOUNG PEOPLE WANTING

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.012
TO SHOW UP AND GO TO SCHOOL- SO

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:38.714
I AM HOPING THAT SOMEHOW SOME

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.483
WAY WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:42.718
RELIEF AND COLD WOULD RELIEVE.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.854
THAT WE ARE INSERTING YOU KNOW

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.555
MENTAL HEALTH. AND OTHER

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.324
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT WILL

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.526
REQUIRE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:54.463
THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING GOOD.

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.967
ABOUT WORKING THROUGH THE

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.802
PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE STILL IN.

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:03.939
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR COM

PRESUME BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:09.745
RESPONSE FROM NOT JUST YOU

SENATOR NIELSEN MENTIONED IS A

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.826
NUMBER THAT WE HAVE. REQUESTED

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:33.262

BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:43.839
BEEN UNDERUSED UNSPENT BY OTHER

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.308

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.010
REALLOCATION PROCESS FOR THOSE

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.979
UNSPENT DOLLARS AND SO AS WE-

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.747
CONTINUE OUR ADVOCACY THE ONE

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:54.183
POINT NINE BILLION IS. WHAT WE

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.050

THE END THE AMOUNT WAS ONE POINT

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.977
NINE. BUT DOES THAT NOT MEAN YOU

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:23.712
CAN SPEND THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.381
IF IT'S AVAILABLE AND WE DON'T

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.816
GET ME WRONG- COMPENSATED BACKED

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.652

I'LL JUST I WON I WON AND I'M

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:44.800
TRYING TO ASK WHAT'S THE RISK

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.835
WHAT'S THE TOTAL RISK THERE IS

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:48.103
NO NUMBER. THE NUMBER IS OPEN

01:11:48.170 --> 01:12:01.383
ENDED. A MINUTE MISLI ARE YOU.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.787
APOLOGY CENTER BY I CAN'T HEAR I

THERE IS. CAN YOU HEAR ME-

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.701
CENTER GOALIE WHILE THEY'RE

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:20.269
TWELVE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.771

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.773
CAN HEAR YOU OKAY GREAT SO

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.676
SENATOR LEAHY'S QUESTION IS. IT

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:30.145
IS THIS IS THE CASH FLOW IS THE

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.880
DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE CASH FLOW

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:34.316
THE RISK THAT'S BEING ASSUME TO

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:37.219
NOW OR IS IT HIGHER. YES THE ONE

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.021
POINT NINE BILLION WAS- THE

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.657
STATE ESTIMATE OF THE QUEUE OF

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:44.326
APPLICATIONS THAT. ARE GOING TO

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.528
BE COMING IN THROUGH THE END OF

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:49.198
MARCH. AND MARCH ISN'T AN

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.999
IMPORTANT DATE BECAUSE THAT IS

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.735
WHEN THE RENTER PROTECTIONS.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:53.969
THAT ARE INSTRUCTED NOT WOULD

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.939
END AND SO THE PROGRAM IS

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:59.041
ATTEMPTING TO. FULFILL THE

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.944
OBLIGATIONS OF THE APPLICATIONS

THAT COME IN. TO THAT POINT THAT

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:04.913
IS THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.348
THAT WOULD THAT IS UNDER

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.816
DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT. I

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.384
UNDERSTAND THAT MY QUESTION WAS

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.286
IS IT. THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:13.889
CAME IN IN. WHAT DO YOU DOES

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.858
THIS AGAIN DOES THIS ALLOW TO

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.292
SPEND MORE THAN ONE POINT NINE

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.327
MILLION WHAT IS THE CAST WHEN

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:22.231
I'M ASKING. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN.

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.999
UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY A

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.801
LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN THAT THIS

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:28.137
LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:29.938
INPUT IN IT MAINLY AT LEAST ON.

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.707
OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE DOESN'T

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:34.476
SEEM TO HAVE MUCH INPUT IN SO

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:35.511
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:36.979
THE RISK IS. LONG TERM IS-

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:39.047
CAPPERS ARE NO CAP. THAT'S WHAT

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.150
I'M ASKING YOU. THERE IS NO CAP

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.684

ANTICIPATED REACHING THREE

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.220
BILLION AGAIN WE HAVE AN

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:46.522
ESTIMATE OF ONE POINT NINE

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:53.428
OUT. SO YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.963
THERE IS NO CAP THAT MEANS THAT

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.799
OUR GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO BE.

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.667

FOR THAT ANSWER I HAVE. SOME

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.540
COMMENTS NOW THAT I JUST WANTED

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.543
TO SHARE WITH THE- LEGISLATURE.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.711
AYE- LET ME IN I DON'T THINK

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:14.550
THAT'S WHAT- MISLI SAID. IT IS A

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:17.119
I THINK SHE AND SHE AND I CAN

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.288
LETTER CORRECT BUT- I THINK SHE

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:20.589
INTERPRETED WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.825
IS THAT IF THREE BILLION CAME IN

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:23.959
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.694
WHEN I ASKED IF WE- THREE

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:28.764
BILLION OKAY. IT WOULD HAVE I

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.465
TRIED TO GET SHE ANSWERED THERE

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:31.767
IS NO CAP SO THAT MEANS IF WE

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.969
SPEND. THREE BILLION OR WE LOAN

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:37.506
LET'S PUT IT IN A BETTER TERM WE

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:38.140
LOAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:39.441
MEANS THAT THE GENERAL FOR IF WE

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.843
DID NOT RECEIVE IT FROM THE

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:42.110
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE ON OUR

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:43.612
GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO HAVE TO

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:44.646
PAY THAT AMOUNT WHATEVER THAT

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:46.548
AMOUNT IS A CASH FLOW. LOAN WE

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:49.251

AMOUNT THAT IS BEFORE US. YEAH

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:54.890
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID. WELL I

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:58.093
HAS OUT THERE IS THERE IS THE

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.228
ONE POINT NINE A CAP ON RATE

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:01.930
RELIEF. THERE'S A YES OR NO

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:05.167
EITHER IT IS OR IT ISN'T. WELL

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.469
THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT INCLUDE A

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.305
CAP THE CAP IS THE ESTIMATE THAT

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:13.041
WE HAVE- PROVIDED TO THE FEDERAL

STATE MEET. THERE'S NO LANGUAGE

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:19.248
IN THE LANGUAGE IS ONLY FOR A

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:21.083
CASH FLOW LOAN SO IT IS NOT AN

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:24.186
ALLOCATION IT IS ONLY ON A LOAN

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.954

BUT IT IS ONLY A CASH FLOW LOAN

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:30.158
SO THERE IS NO ALLOCATION

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:31.193
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. DAN BUT

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.895
THERE IS A LIABILITY AND THAT'S

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.296
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO POINT OUT

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.597
THAT THERE IS A LIABILITY IN

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:36.798
WHATEVER THAT. WHATEVER THE

AMOUNT IS THAT GETS LOAN. IS

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:40.369

THE AMOUNT IS IT COULD BE ONE

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.181
POINT NINE OR IT COULD BE. THREE

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:49.972
EXAMPLE. THERE IS A CONTRACT LET

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.640
FOR THE SLEEP TRAIN ARENA TO

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.775
HAVE COPD PATIENTS GO OUT THERE

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:55.978
TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. NO BID

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:59.614
CONTRACT. THEY SAW NINE PATIENTS

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:00.782
. WE'VE SEEN THE VALENCIA LAB

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.017
IT'S NOT PERFORMING AT THE

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.318
LEVELS WE WANT WE'VE BEEN INTO

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:06.621
THIS CAN'T PANDEMIC NOW FOR HOW

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:09.391
LONG A LONG TIME. AND IF WE

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.392
STAND IN THE STATE EMERGING

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:11.159
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'RE GONNA

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:13.095
GET OUT OF IT ANYTIME SOON I

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:13.962
THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:16.765
LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN AND SAY

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.233
NO TO THE GOVERNOR. AND NOTED

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.868
THAT MINISTRATION THAT WE WANT

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:22.104
TO SEE THESE CONTRACTS WE WANT

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:23.105
TO SEE PERFORMANCES ON THOSE

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:25.941
CONTRACTS. IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:28.543
WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB BUT WE'VE

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.412
IS HE SERVED ALL OF OUR POWER.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.781
TO THE GOVERNOR. TO A GUY WHO

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:35.150
CAN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.486
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. TWO GUYS

01:17:37.552 --> 01:17:39.221
WHO CAN SIT IN A BASEBALL OR A

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:41.289
FOOTBALL STADIUM WITH NO MASK ON

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:44.226
UNTIL MY CHILD SHE HAS TO WEAR A

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.527
MASK AT SCHOOL. THAT'S THE

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.062
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM HERE THEY

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.563
ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING IS NOT

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.599
RELATING BACK AND FORTH. SO

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.534
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:53.502
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MONEY LET'S

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:55.137
TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GETTING

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.338
THESE CONTRACTS WE DON'T DO THAT

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.740
HERE. WE JUST OPEN ENDED A CAR.

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:02.277
THE BUDGET. TO ALLOW TO SPEND

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.612
MONEY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:04.846
TO PAY BACK IF IT DOESN'T GET

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:05.781
COMMITTEE BY THE FEDERAL

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:06.748
GOVERNMENT SO I THINK THIS IS

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.683
THE PLACE WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:09.251
CONVERSATIONS BUT WE DON'T.

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.419
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM.

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:11.787
BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER THE STATE OF

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:12.654
EMERGENCY AND WE'VE GIVEN ALL

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:14.456
THE POWER OF THIS LEGISLATURE.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.058

01:18:16.124 --> 01:18:17.726
MINISTRATION AND I DON'T BELIEVE

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.361
THAT'S THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE OF

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:20.796
CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN IN THIS A

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.030
LONG TIME NOW. WE DO A LOT MORE

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:24.166
THAN WE KNEW WHEN WE FIRST

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:24.900
STARTED OUT AND IT'S TIME THAT

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.368
WE ACTUALLY DO OUR JOB. AND TAKE

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:29.037
BACK THE POWER. I'M SORRY. THANK

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.073
YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.741
LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:37.446
MIKES UP BEFORE. RIGHT OKAY-

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.181
MODERATOR YOU CAN GET READY TO

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.549
KEEP FOLKS UP WE'VE GOT SOME

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:41.783
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM BUT BEFORE

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.519
THAT I WANT TO SAY. THAT IN MY

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:47.289
HI READ OUR MATERIALS CAREFULLY

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:48.590
I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.292
AUTHORIZATION OF A CASH FLOW

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:53.428
LOAN IS PUT IS THAT IS APPROVING

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:56.865
A RISK AND ET AT LEAST ALL HIGH

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:59.734
AND WE AND I- WE WILL SEE BUT I

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:01.069
BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUES TO AGREE.

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:07.209
THAT THE RISK. OF HAVING. PEOPLE

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:10.979
WHO ARE NOW HOUSE ON THE STREET

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:14.116
FOR HAVING SMALL LANDLORDS NOT

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.217
BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.119
OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:19.221
TENANTS CANNOT PAY THEM IS A

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.556
HIGHER RISK IN MY OPINION THEN

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.058
THE RISK FROM THE FEDERAL

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.893
GOVERNMENT GIVEN THAT THE

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.995
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.630
CLEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:32.033
REDISTRIBUTING FUNDS NOW I AM

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.704
LESS CONCERNED ABOUT ARE. HIGHLY

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.006
EXCEEDING THE ESTIMATION THAT

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:39.141
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:41.977
GIVEN BECAUSE IT IS VERY

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:44.679
DIFFICULT FOR IT TO PROCESS A

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:47.082
FIGURE SUCH AS THREE BILLION IN

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:48.383
THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.286
BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH AND THE

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:53.588
ESTIMATE IS BASED ON THE

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:56.191
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PENDING

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.926
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT IT

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.427
IT'S BASED ON SOME REAL DATA

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:02.397
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THE PROGRAM

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.733
OPEN FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. ON

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:07.936
SO WHILE WE CERTAINLY HAVE

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:10.105
DIFFERING OPINIONS AS TO WHICH

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.806
OF THESE ACTIONS ARE GIVING THE

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.542
ADMINISTRATION PERHAPS MORE

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:16.945
THROUGH ALREADY THEN WE SHOULD I

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.647
AM VERY CLEAR THAT THE ACTIONS

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:22.217
WE ARE TAKING TODAY ARE BOTH. TO

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:25.187
MY TASTE OR NOT THE CARD US

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:27.022

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.859

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:32.661
ACTIONS IN HERE LIKE THE COVERED

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:35.230

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:37.199
HAVE OTHERWISE GONE THROUGH JAIL

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:39.801
BC BUT WE AS THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:42.304
SAID NO WE WILL. WE ARE NOT

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.172
GOING TO ACT ON THEM AND THAT

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.975
