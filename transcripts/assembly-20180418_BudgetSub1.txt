THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY'S SOMEONE HEARING ON APRIL EIGHTEENTH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE FIRST PANEL UP FOR ISSUE ONE WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. LET A STOUT THE DIRECTOR THE APARTMENT COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. AS WELL AS ADJACENT WEMBLEY THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FIFTY ADMINISTERS FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR PROGRAMS INTENDED TO REDUCE POVERTY AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT AND THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE NETWORK OF AGENCIES USE THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. FOR THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY THROUGH AN ARRAY OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. THESE MAY INCLUDE JOB TRAINING EDUCATION HEAD START IN CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. VOLUNTEER TAX INCOME TAX ASSISTANCE. TRANSPORTATION VOUCHERS FOOD BANKS AND HOMELESS A ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SUCH AS RAIL VOUCHERS SHELTERS. AND TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE TRANSITIONAL LIVING ASSISTANCE. EACH YEAR THESE AGENCIES SERVE ABOUT ONE POINT NINE MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THROUGH EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR EVERYONE DOLLAR OF COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT FUNDING CALIFORNIA'S NETWORK OF AGENCIES LEVERAGE ON AVERAGE TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS. FROM FEDERAL STATE. LOCAL AND PRIVATE SOURCES AND THIS OFTEN INCLUDES THE VALUE OF VOLUNTEER SERVICES. THESE AGENCIES PROVIDE A TREMENDOUS SERVICE AND SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS ALONE TO THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY. IN FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED. A TWO AND HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING FOR THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. DEPARTMENT WORKS WITH A NETWORK OF AGENCIES TO PROVIDE PAYMENTS FOR UTILITY BILLS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO PREVENT. HOME ENERGY SHUT OFF EMERGENCY HEATING AND COOLING REPAIR AND WEATHER STATION SERVICES. THESE CRITICAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO PROBABLY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS EVERY YEAR. MANY OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS INCLUDE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS THE ELDERLY DISABLED AND. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. THE LIE YOU GRANT FOR FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POINT EIGHT MILLION. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDING IS USED FOR WEATHER IS A XIN SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO RECEIVED A RELATIVELY SMALL GRANT OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FOR THE WEATHER STATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED EIGHTEEN MILLION OF GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION FUNDING. FOR THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES SOLAR PEAVEY. SOLAR WATER HEATERS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES AND LOW INCOME SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SAVE ENERGY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES A TOTAL SPENDING OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION ALL OF WHICH IS FEDERAL FUNDING. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENTS FEDERAL PROGRAMS HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSISTENT AND WE ANTICIPATE LEVEL FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT. FUNDING FOR THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WAS INCREASED BY CONGRESS THIS YEAR. WITH CALIFORNIA ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE OF TO AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. WHILE WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE FINAL WORD IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE CORRECT CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE AROUND A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION FOR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. AND ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AGAIN RECOMMENDS ELIMINATING ARE FEDERAL PROGRAMS. THERE CONTINUES TO BE SUPPORT FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND CONGRESS AS DEMONSTRATED THIS YEAR AND WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THESE PROGRAMS AS THE FEDERAL BUDGET. BLOCK CONTINUES TO PROGRESS. ON THE RELATIVELY POSITIVE NOTE CALIFORNIA WILL ALSO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY NINE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT. BETWEEN THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION AND BARCLAYS BANK TO RESOLVE ALLEGATIONS OF ENERGY MARKET MANIPULATION. THIS ONE TIME PAYMENT IS TO BE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR LIVE HEAP GUIDELINES OUR LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM GUIDELINES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NETWORK OF LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS. THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO USE THESE FUNDS FOR WEATHERIZATION SERVICES THAT WILL HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT ON REDUCING UTILITY COSTS FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. I WHAT I WANT TO CLOSE BY JUST STATING THAT CSTO OF COMMITTED COORDINATING STATE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CLAIM THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR REDUCING POVERTY. FOR A SECOND YEAR THE DEPARTMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ADMINISTER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUND. FOR GRANTS TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO PROMOTE THE CAL EITC THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT LEAVES A REDUCING POVERTY WORKERS MADE UP OF PUBLIC AGENCIES NONPROFITS AND ASSOCIATIONS. TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF E. I. T. SEE AN INCREASE IN CLAIMS AND DIE THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. A GOOD DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE. SEEING NONE ALL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FRONT QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. I WANTED TO GET A LEVEL OF DETAIL MORE IF I COULD ABOUT THE DISGORGEMENT FUNDS WHICH YOU JUST REFERENCE REGARDING THE BY PLAY SETTLEMENT CAN YOU ELABORATE. ON SPECIFICALLY SAID IT WAS UNDER THE LIGHT HEAP GUIDELINES BUT CAN YOU GO INTO A LEVEL OF DETAIL ABOUT HOW THOSE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT. SO THAT THE DOLLARS ON THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE A PROVISIONS ARE THAT IT IS USED TO LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES SO THE. IT'S VERY LOOSELY ARM. CONTROLLED I GUESS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD SO I AND ALL THAT WERE REQUIRED TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LIE HEAPED GUIDELINES SO THAT COULD BE USED FOR UTILITY ASSISTANCE. EMERGENCY HEATING AND COOLING AND OR WHETHER IS ASIAN SERVICES. ATTA AND THE TIME LIMIT FOR YOU AND IT'S BEEN IN THE DOLLARS WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL NETWORK OF AGENCIES TO DISCUSS THE BEST WAY OF ALLOCATING THE FUNDS TO OUR NETWORK OF LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND FOR THE USE OF WEATHER IS ASIANS WE HAVE NOT YET. ARE COME UP WITH THE EXACT MODEL OF WHAT WE WOULD USE THE DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR IT MEANING WHAT TYPE OF MEASURES IS THERE ABOUT A DIFFERENT USE OF THE DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED TO AFFORD THE MOST BENEFIT FOR THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. HOW DO WE? SOME OF THEM DIG A LITTLE BIT SURE FURTHER INTO THIS IT IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. HELPED TO INFLUENCE SOME OF THAT DECISION MAKING A RULE MAKING PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED STRUGGLING WITH HIGH ENERGY ARE. ABLE TO BE THE FRONT OF THESE DISGORGEMENT FUNDS OR. IS THERE A PROCESS THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING ESTABLISHED. WELL TYPICALLY HOW THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS AT ALLOCATING FUNDS IS BASED ON THE POVERTY POPULATION AS WELL AS THE COST OF ENERGY THE FUEL COSTS AS WELL AS CLIMATE FACTORS TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW HOW THOSE DOLLARS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. AND WE WILL BE WORKING WITH US LIKE I SAID OUR LOW INCOME PROVIDERS AS. WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE BEST USE OF THE FUNDS. CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS FEDERAL FUNDS AND. A MAYBE BEFORE I GET INTO THAT QUESTION I'LL JUST QUICKLY ESTABLISHED QUORUM BECAUSE. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE GOING MULTIPLE PLACE. SCIENCE. TO OTHER MEMBERS. DOCTOR ARAMBULA HERE. HARPER. MATHIS HERE RUBIO. WOULD QUORUM. LET ME FINISH WITH THE DISGORGEMENT FUNDS IF I IF I CAN CAN YOU UPDATE US ONCE YOU'VE. HAD A DECISION OR DECIDED ON HOW TO SO THAT WORK KEPT IN THE LOOP THAT NOW I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO FEDERAL FUNDING IF I COULDN'T HAVE YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE. HE SAID THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR A HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION HERE AND THEY HERE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT TWENTY NINETEEN IS STILL. UP IN THE AIR. A CAN CAN YOU GO TO A LEVEL OF DETAIL ABOUT WHEN WE WILL START TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS AND SO WE CURRENTLY FOR OUR FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE RECEIVED NINETY PERCENT OF OUR LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION. DOLLARS SO WERE AWAITING THE FINAL AWARD. AND THEN WILL HAVE THOSE DOLLARS TO DISTRIBUTE OUT TO OUR AGENCIES THIS UP THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT SECTION THAT YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED THAT'S THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. OUR OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT WE RECEIVED ABOUT HALF OF THE SIXTY TWO AND A HALF MILLION AND THOSE DOLLARS WE RECEIVE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHERE OUR LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE RECEIVE NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE DOLLARS INITIALLY. AND THEN THE REMAINING TEN PERCENT AT A LATER DATE SO WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF THE DOLLARS THAT WERE STILL AWAITING. FOR OUR LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND WE DID HEAR THAT CONGRESS DID APPROVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND BASED ON THE ESTIMATES IT SHOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE WHICH IS THE HUNDRED NINETY IN TOTAL FUNDING. SO. COMPARING THIS YEAR TO LAST YEAR WE WILL HAVE INCREASED FUND HARASSED WEB TWENTY MILLION YES THAT'S CORRECT. LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE DYESS IF NOT THIS WAS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. ALRIGHT. I AM I. WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU DR ARAMBULA FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN OUR COMMUNITY SOLAR VENT AND FOR ALSO MEETING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO DISCUSS THE. LIE WITH THE EXPENDITURE PLAN AND ALSO FOR THE STAFFS ASSISTANCE IN OUR DEPARTMENT BRIEFING ON OUR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN CST HAS RECEIVED A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO MILLION FOR THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. OF THESE FUNDS A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SOLAR PEAVEY PROJECTS. AS DETAILED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE SINGLE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS HAVE RECEIVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES. AND. TWENTY NINE HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS HAVE RECEIVE SOLAR PEAVEY SYSTEMS. ABOUT FIFTY MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR THE MULTI FAMILY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS. FORTY NINE MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS CONSISTING OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BEEN SERVED UNDER THE PROGRAM. FOR THE EIGHTEEN MILLION THAT WAS APPROPRIATED AND THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR. OF THE LOW INCOME FOR LOWER INCOME MULTI FAMILY SOLAR AND FARM WORKER WEATHER'S ASIAN PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS ON ALLOCATING FIVE MILLION FOR OUR COMMUNITY SOLAR PROJECT. AND WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER SEVEN MILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE MULTI FAMILY AND OF THE SEVEN MILLION FIVE MILLION IS SET ASIDE FOR THE MULTI FAMILY FARM WORKER HOUSING. COMPONENT AND THEN FINALLY FIVE MILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY FARM WORKER ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLES PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF HOLDING STAKEHOLDER. OUR ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND. INFORMATIONAL FORUMS. AND. FOR THE POPE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM FOR BOTH THE COMMUNITY SOLAR AND SINGLE FAMILY FARM WORKER. WE HOPE TO MAKE AWARDS IN THE FALL. I'M AND I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT ONLY TEN MILLION OF THE HUNDRED NINETY TWO HAS YET TO BE AWARDED SO ALL THE DOLLARS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TEN MILLION AND THAT'S THE FIVE MILLION EACH FOR THE COMMUNITY SOLAR AND THE FARM WORKER HOUSING SINGLE FAMILY FARM WORKER. HOUSING. I'M REGARDING UNSPENT APPROPRIATIONS OF ARE FISCAL YEAR FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IS CLOSE TO BEING FULLY EXPANDED. AS WELL AS THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN STATE FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FUNDING FOR THE MULTI FAMILY AND A SINGLE FAMILY SOLAR. HOWEVER THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR THE LIE WITH TWO POINT OH WHICH WAS A SINGLE FAMILY COMPONENT. WAS IMPLEMENTED LATE DUE TO ISSUES THAT WERE NOT WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS. SINCE ANY FUNDS REMAINING WILL RIVER THE DEPARTMENT SUBMITTED A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE. FOR SERVICES TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AS INTENDED. IF THE BCP IS APPROVED CST WILL PROVIDE THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS WHAT THE CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR TIME. AND THIS BCP IS SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD LAST YEAR AND WAS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR OUR FIFTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. FUNDING. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE EXTENSION THE FUNDS WILL BE FULLY EXPENDED. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OLEO. JENNY FELLOW AT THE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE REVIEWED THAT BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR THE REAPPROPRIATION AND WE HAVE NO CONCERNS OF THAT. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. NO SORRY AND MAY HAVE ONE OTHER. FEW PANELISTS HERE THROUGH SECOND. WE'VE DONE THIS ALL SUMMER FROM CENTRAL COAST ENERGY SERVICES FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL COAST ENERGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE LIKE HEAT FUNDED SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES IN MONTEREY. SALMON TALE SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES. WE RECENTLY COMBINED WITH LOCAL STAFF TO SERVE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AS SAN FRANCISCO PENINSULA ENERGY SERVICES. WHERE ONE OF FORTY TWO LOCAL ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS UNDER CONTRACT TO CSD? UTILITY PAYMENT ASSISTANCE AND HELP WITH SHUT OFFS ARE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THIS NETWORKS PROVIDES IN EVERY COUNTY. WE ALSO VISIT THE HOMES OF THE LOW INCOME AND NEEDY TO INSTALL HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. MEASURES. OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF EACH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WE PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICE LOCAL JOBS AND TRAINING AND ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF LIGHT WITH. AND CONTINUED FUNDING FOR THE CRITICAL PROGRAM THAT IT IS. ACCORDING TO SEE STDS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN SERVED. THROUGH LIFE HE BY WITH. WHILE THERE ARE NUMBER OF VALUABLE COMPONENT SUPPLY WITH IN THE SINGLE FAMILY WHETHER AID STATION PROGRAM ALONE. NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE DWELLINGS HAVE BEEN SERVED. BY BE LIKE HE PROVIDERS. THIS ADDED THE VALUE OF TWENTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE PROGRAM. I'M MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ADDED HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES IN EACH OF THESE HOMES. THAT CAN'T BE FUNDED WITH GIGI R. F. MONIES. I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE CREATION AND PASSAGE OF LIE WITH LANGUAGE IN SB EIGHTY NINE LAST YEAR. WHICH WOULD BELIEVE ME SPARK IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH SERVICE DELIVERY TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND COST EFFECTIVE USE. OF G. G. R. F. MONEY. YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WE VOICE MANY CONCERNS LAST YEAR. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE CONCERNS WERE NOT MEANT TO QUESTION THE STATE'S NEED FOR LIGHT WHAT SERVICES. BUT RATHER THE AGENCIES ADMINISTRATION AND DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR THE PROGRAM. WE'RE COMMITTED WERE INVESTED IN IMPROVING EXPANDING AND CONTINUING SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THE ENERGY NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THANKS IN PART TO THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHTY NINE AND IT'S ANTICIPATED. IMPLEMENTATION WE ARE HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF NEW LIVE WITH FUNDING. IN ADDITION TO THE HOME HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS OF LOW INCOME HOMES THAT ARE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE LIFE HE PROGRAM. WE RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS NEED TO PROVIDE ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM. WE HOPE WHY WHAT FUNDING WILL CONTINUE TO BRETT PREVENT ANY GAP IN DELIVERY OF THESE CRITICAL SERVICES. AND REQUEST A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION THIS BIT SCHOOL YEAR. IF THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES THAT CST IS THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY TO CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER LIGHT WEB. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE FOLLOWING IN IMPLEMENTING S. B. EIGHTY NINE TO BEST ENSURE SUCCESS. NEW FUNDING FOR LIVE WHERE MUST INCLUDE NEW PROGRAM SOLICITATIONS AND GUIDELINES THE OUR PRODUCTS OF CAREFUL ANALYSIS IN COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND IMPLEMENTERS FROM BOTH PHASES OF BY WAY. IN SOLICITATIONS WEIGHT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO POTENTIAL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS APPLICANTS. THAT HAVE EXISTING TIES TO THE COMMUNITY THEY WOULD SERVE. PROPOSAL SCORES SHOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO THE LONGEVITY OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THE STRENGTH OF LOCAL TIES DEMONSTRATED BY APPLICANTS. APPLICANTS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN DELIVERING THE SPECIFIC SERVICES SHOULD HAVE PRIORITY STATUS. TRANSPARENCY GENUINE PUBLIC PROCESSES AND MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL APPLICANTS SHOULD BE INSURED. WE ALSO URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING PROGRAM ANALYSIS IMPROVEMENT AND S. B. EIGHTY NINE INCORPORATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO FURTHER DATE DELAYS IN PROGRAM DELIVERY. THANK YOU MISTER OSCAR. NEXT WE HAVE LUIS SANCHEZ FROM THE. COMMUNITY RESOURCE PROJECT. HELLO YES MY UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE LIGHT WENT. I AGREE WITH MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE SAID I TAKE ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE SAID SO. LET ME BE PLAIN I AM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LOW INCOME OVERSIGHT BOARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING. HERE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS THE CONVERGENCE OF LOW INCOME ENERGY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. REPRESENTING DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAM. CLEARLY THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE WHAT CAN WE DO TO LEVERAGE. YOU NO SERVICES AND FUNDING THAT WOULD COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD COME FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD COME FROM UTILITIES AND RATEPAYERS. AND WHAT WOULD COME FROM. BASICALLY THE ACTIONS OF CS BG HAD WE HAD WE BRING ALL THIS TOGETHER TO HAVE MAXIMUM OF FACT. WITH COMMUNITIES SO LET ME ADDRESS SOME METHODOLOGY IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD I THINK THAT THE OPEN SOLICITATION PROCESS. MAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SENSE YOU KNOW FOR CST I THINK WAS A BOLD MOVE ON THEIR PART TWO YEARS AGO. I WAS. DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT CST BACK IN THE NINETIES SO I AM FAMILIAR WITH THEIR A SERVICE PROVIDER NETWORK. I AM ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE PARTICULAR FUNDS ARE. EARMARKED THEY AREN'T THEY'RE NOT PUT OUT FOR COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION. BUT HAVING SAID THAT LIE WET WENT DOWN A DIFFERENT TRACK IN THE WHOLE IDEA OF BEING PERFORMANCE IN PRODUCTION. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INCREASE PERFORMS WHO PRODUCTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE SERVICES GOING INTO THE COMMUNITIES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE AT THE CPC. IS CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF IMPACT. I ENVIRONMENTALLY BUT TAUGHT CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL BURDEN TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. ESPECIALLY WERE REGIONS ARE GETTING HOTTER AND THEY'RE GETTING COLDER. THE COST OF UTILITIES AS A FINANCIAL COMPONENT FOR MANY OF THESE HOLES HOUSEHOLDS IS. NUMBER TWO CONSIDERATION AFTER HOUSING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT Y. WHAT BRINGS AS PART OF THIS CONVERGENCE OF PROGRAMS. A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT INTRODUCES THE SOLAR COMPONENT BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENERGY PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE UTILITIES. THIRTY THE ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE ACCOUNT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A SOLAR COMPONENT SO WHAT IS THAT ME. MANY OF THE COOLING MEASURES THAT WE COULD INSTALL IN HOMES AND FRESNO KERN KINGS COUNTY. AT SOME OF THE OTHER MORE ARID REGIONS AT THE STATE SIMPLY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS. YOU BRING IN SOLAR. THE PROBLEM IS IS ALLEVIATED. SO HAVING SAID THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LIE WHIP IS DONE WITH AN OPEN SOLICITATION IT'S IT BROUGHT AND IT HAS. BY IT BROUGHT IN BEST OF BREED CONTRACTORS. FROM AGAIN THE EAST OR THE ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE ACCOUNT. WITH THE UTILITY PROGRAMS. THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MENTION I'M ALSO ON THE BORDER DIRECTORS WOULD LIKE OPERATE THE OF A COMPASS CENA. WHERE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF FARMWORKERS SERVICE PROVIDERS WE ARE A MAJOR ADMINISTRATOR? AND WE WORKED WITH LOCAL COMPANIES IN TERMS TO LIE WITH PROGRAM. SO GAS YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM COULD COULD COULD USE SOME CHANGES A YES WE DO AGREE WITH S. B. EIGHTY NINE IN TERMS OF ITS INTENT. ARE WE FRANKLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. NO SORT OF BINDING CONTRACTUAL PRIORITY. WE THINK THAT. AGAIN AND OPEN SOLICITATION SHOULD FOCUS ON. NOT ONLY EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY NOT ONLY THE ABILITY TO GENERATE. JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES. BUT ALSO PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE. AND CONNECTION WITH THESE DOLLARS IS GETTING THE SPENT GETTING THEM SPENT EFFICIENTLY. SO WE FEEL THAT OPENING UP THE SOLICITATION ARE BRINGING IT FORWARD. TO SUCCESSFUL SORTS OF CONTRACTORS SORT OF NONPROFIT RELATIONSHIPS THAT LIE WEPT TO A LARGE DEGREE REPRESENTS. WHICH IS A VERY UNIQUE I'VE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THE BEST PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT I SEE OUT THERE DELIVERING SERVICES. THROUGH A PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM TARGETING LOW INCOME. IT'S THE COMBINATION OF FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS ON ENERGY ASSISTANCE. WHICH SHOULD NOT TRY TO HAMPER THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO ENCOURAGE IT WE SHOULD TRY TO BUILD ON. AND WE THINK MOVING FORWARD. IF THE BCP IS A GRANTED AND WE THINK IF YOU KNOW AGAIN WE LOOK AT ALSO. NATALIE UNMET NEED BUT THE WAITING LIST. AND MULTI FAMILY ALONE IT EXCEEDS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE VAST AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED SERVICES. THROUGH THE LIE WHAT PROGRAM. SO WE KIND OF UNDERSTAND THAT GIGI R. F. IS IT'S A SORT OF A A SITUATION WHERE IT'S YEAR TO YEAR WE GET THAT. BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO CREATE STABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN THE PROGRAM BASED ON PEOPLE'S NEEDS. SO AGAIN. I'M. READY ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. WE ALSO SUPPORT ARE THE CONTINUATION IN THE REFUNDING OF THE PROGRAM. WE SUPPORT OPEN SOLICITATION WE SUPPORT. NO SORT OF WAITED PRIORITY IN CONNECTION WITH WITH CONTRACTORS. AND WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU KNOW AGAIN. US CST THROUGH THE SOLICITATION PROCESS TO CONTINUE TO USE PASTOR BREAK CONTRACTORS. THAT WORK WITH OESA PROGRAM ADDED CPC THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SANTOS. NEXT I BELIEVE WE'RE BOB CUSTOM MADE. BUT LOUIS SERGEANTS. NOT. DO YOU MEAN MIXED UP. I THINK WE GOT THOSE MIXED UP SORRY ABOUT THAT MILITARY READY. THE I I YIELDED TO PARK HERE YEAH. SURE BANQUET AYE BATES MENA SUVARI. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M WE SPONSOR SOME THE C. E. O. COMMUNITY RESOURCE PROJECT. HERE AND NOT SACRAMENTO.

SYRUPY PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED POVERTY INTERVENTION SERVICES LIKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. MEASURES H. BACK REPAIR REPLACEMENT. TO LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT PROGRAMS AND TWO SOLAR PEAVEY INSTALLATION IN THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND OUR REGION. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE ADMINISTERED OVER NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ENERGY RELATED CONTRACTS WORKING ON OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES AND SERVING OVER FOUR HUNDRED LOW INCOME. RESIDENTS. BECAUSE OF OUR CONTINUOUS AND LONG TERM EFFORTS ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT PHASE TWO SERVICES WITHOUT DELAY. AS A RESULT WE'RE ON TRACK TO COMPLETE OUR FACE TO CONTRACT THIS MAY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BY THE END OF THE CONTRACT WE HAVE OUR WE WOULD HAVE THE WEATHER RISE THREE HUNDRED HOMES AND PROVIDED ROOFTOP SOLAR TWO HUNDRED FORTY. ONE HOMES IN THE REGION ARE WITHIN THE FORTY EIGHT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT RESIDE THERE. OUR SUCCESS HAS BEEN BASED ON THOSE ELEMENTS OF S. B. EIGHTY NINE. SYRUPY HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH AN UNDERSTANDING LOW IN COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. WE HAVE AN INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THE RESIDENTS AND OTHER PARTNERS IN THE AREA. SYRUPY HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF PROVIDING HEALTH AND SAFETY. MEASURES AS WELL AS ENERGY EFFICIENT PROGRAMS OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. THE SERVICES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR STATES LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND THERE'S NO OTHER STATE PROGRAM THAT OFFERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO THEM. SEE YOUR PMI LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDER COLLEAGUES URGE THAT LIE WHIPPED CONTINUE IN THE AMOUNT OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND BE INCORPORATED IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PROGRAM EFFICIENCY AND SURE CONTINUED SUCCESS. SO. I AM AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR THE OPTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE AMY REVELL. WE CAN CREATE ONCE FOR HER THAT GREAT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMIE REVOLVE WITH ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK OR A PEN. A PENSACOLA IS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FOR. ASIAN AMERICAN IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES LIVING ON THE FRONT LINES OF POLLUTION. A PAN IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA BIBLE JUSTICE ALLIANCE OR SAY HI. AS WELL AS A WE ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE EQUITY COALITION WHICH IS A NETWORK OF ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. AIMED AT ENSURING EQUITABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF CLIMATE INVESTMENTS AND SPECIFICALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. A PAN ALONG WITH SAID HA AND CC EASY. SUPPORT THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM I STRONGLY URGE LEGISLATORS TO REVISE THE BUDGET. TO INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM AT A LEVEL AS OUR DIMENSION OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN THE LETTER THAT WE SIGNED ON TO FROM BY THE LOW INCOME OVERSIGHT BOARD. FIRST LIE WITH IS A UNIQUE AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAM FUNDED BY THE KIND INVESTMENTS PROGRAM. LILA IS A MODEL PROGRAM IN THE STATE FOR PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE CLEAN ENERGY SERVICES INCLUDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SOLAR. TO UNDER HOW UNDERSERVED HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN BOTH SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS. AS COMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMS LIE WITH IS THE ONLY PROGRAM IN WHICH A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FUNDING SERVES LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. REFLECTING DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE MOST EARTH OVERBURDENED AREAS IN OUR STATE. MY LIP IS ALSO UNIQUE IN DELIVERING A ONE STOP SHOP WHOLE BUILDING APPROACH BY OFFERING DEEPER ENERGY RETROFITS COUPLED WHEN POSSIBLE TO SELECT. LOOKING AHEAD LILAC IS PLANNING ON PILOTING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES LIKE COMMUNITY SOLAR AS WELL AS A FARMER COULD PROGRAM THAT WE SEE BEING ABLE TO BE SCALED AT OTHER AYE. ENERGY AGENCIES. SECOND LILAC DELIVERS CRITICAL BENEFITS TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO OVERCOME BARRIERS THAT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FACE IN ACCESSING RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. CURRENTLY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS HAVE AN AVERAGE ENERGY BURDEN THAT'S APPROXIMATELY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN HIGH INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WE KNOW THAT ARE HIGH ENERGY BURDEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARISING FROM HOUSING INSTABILITY. HIGH UTILITY EXPENSES AND THE RISK OF UTILITY SHUT OFFS. SINCE ITS LAUNCH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN LILAC HAS SUCCESSFULLY LOWERED ENERGY BILLS FOR OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE. LEAVING MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME AVAILABLE FOR OTHER HOUSEHOLD COSTS LIKE RENT FOOD AND HEALTH CARE. LILAC DELIVERS OTHER TARGETED COMMUNITY BENEFITS LIKE WORKFORCE TRAINING AND PLACEMENT AS WELL AS HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. AND FINALLY. LILA PROMOTES CLIMATE RESILIENT HOMES WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED. WE'VE SEEN HOW CALIFORNIA'S HAVE SUFFERED A DEVASTATING YEAR OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS RANGING FROM WILDFIRES TO DEADLY HEAT WAVES. IN COMMUNITIES WHERE EXTREME HEAT IS BECOMING THE NORM RISING ENERGY COSTS THREATEN THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND SENIORS AS FAMILY STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS. INVESTMENT IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION MUST PRIORITIZE THE MOST IMPACTED HOMES AND COMMUNITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT LIE WHAT DOES THAT. LILAH BRINGS THE BENEFITS OF CLEAN ENERGY TO NEIGHBORHOODS THAT NEED IT THE MOST. FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM ON AND. SEE FUNDING AT A LEVEL OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. MISTER CHAIRMAN IS JUST MULLIN BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE ALSO VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROGRAM YOU BELIEVE IT'S BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. IT HELPS. PROVIDE THAT CLIMATE RESILIENCE TO THOSE LOW INCOME AT FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS FOR SAFER AND HEALTHIER HOME SO WE URGE A FULL I ALLOCATION OF THAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MY NAME IS SIMEON GANT WITH THE CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK AND THE GREEN TECH EDUCATION PROGRAM IN SUPPORT OF THE SEVENTY FIVE ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A CHANCE TO TESTIFYING IN FAVOR OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT WHERE. I AM. MEDICAL ETCETERA THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RECALL BUT IF YOU WERE COMPETING NOW SERVING ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FARM WORKERS A YEAR. AB WE ARE ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS AND THAT I WHIP REGION FIVE. AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS I HAVE MADE THE ARGUMENT FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS BEFORE A LOT OF LIVES LEGISLATORS. THESE PROGRAMS RAGE THAT DISPOSABLE INCOME OF OUR FARMWORKERS. WHICH IS ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE PROPERTY AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE REDUCE THAT THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT SIGNED FULL SUPPORT OF THE PHONE MILLION FOR MY WHIP PICK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. I HAVE ONE. AM I WAS HOPING DIRECTOR YOU CAN EXPANDS THERE WAS A QUESTION RAISED IN THE STAFF COMMENT SECTION ON WHY THE YIELDS ON THE CAN PLEADED PROJECTS NOW COMES. HAS REDUCED AND COMPARED TO FUNDING OVER. TIME FOR SOME OF THE ALLOCATIONS AND WAS HOPING YOU COULD ELABORATE ON THAT. YEAH YOUR SECOND US THAT CALM JASON WHEN WE CHIEF DEPUTY WITH CST. OF SO WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THOSE COMPARISONS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT BETWEEN. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IS IMPORTANT THAT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AS A POINT IN TIME SO FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT. WITH MANY OF THE PROGRAMS ARE STILL IN PLAY AND THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ONGOING. THIS CAN BE CONTINUING PROGRAM OPERATIONS IN EXPENDITURES SO WE WAS CONTINUE TO SEE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS. BE REPORTED. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME WHERE HAS AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IT REFLECTS PRETTY MUCH THE END RESULT WITHIN THE END RESULT OF EXPENDITURE. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE. FOOD THAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS ITEM THAT WAS APPROPRIATED OUR ALLOCATED TO SINGLE FAMILY SO THE PROGRAM. WE WELL THERE WAS TEN POINT NINE IN THAT WE HAD TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF EXPENDITURES THAT WERE REFLECTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. THIS UP THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDED PROJECT EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS A WORKING CAPITAL ADVANCES THAT WERE ISSUED TO THE CONTRACTOR. AND WE ALSO INDICATED THAT HIS I THINK THAT REPORT REFLECT ITS TWO HUNDRED FORTY SOME ODD PROJECTS. BUT SINCE OVER THE SINCE THE ISSUANCE OF THE REPORT WE HAVE. THERE'S BEEN A HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER WITH ANOTHER HUNDRED SIX. IMPLANT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WHICH WOULD PRETTY MUCH BRING THOSE HOLES IN WITHIN TARGET. APPRECIATE THE ANSWER IT'S. NICE TO GET THAT NEXT LEVEL OF DETAIL AND SOME. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS THAT WE ARE EXPANDING OUR IMPLEMENTED EXPEDITIOUSLY IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO ON OUR SIDE? TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING SPENT AND I'M. AS APPROPRIATE OF A TIME AS POSSIBLE. HOME. WEEKEND ETHICS IMPORTANCE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THE LIE WHIP. APPROPRIATION THAT WE RECEIVED TO DATE A FUNDS FOUND ITS FUNDS OF OUR THE DIFFERENCE A PROGRAM SO IT AND. THEY TEND TO BE A FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR PROGRAM OVER ANOTHER. AND TO OVER THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS THE DEPARTMENT IS USE THOSE DOLLARS TO INTO IMPLEMENT NEW PROGRAMS. SEWING IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS IT DOES REQUIRE A CERTAIN PROCESS THAT WE FOLLOW THAT'S ALSO. BEEN FURTHER EMPHASIZE IN S. B. EIGHTY NINE PROVIDE I'M STATUTE THAT'S. THAT'S BEEN PASSED BUT NEW PROGRAMS A CAR. PROGRAM DESIGN STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. AND MANY CASES CA COMPARED THE PROCUREMENTS AND WHAT NOT SO GOING FORWARD. I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO IS TO START TO CONVENE MEETINGS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE TO. MAKE A VALUATIONS OF OF. APPROACHES THAT WORK AND HOME AND THAT THE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T WORKED AS WELL AS I'M STUCK HAVING. CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THEIR INPUT AND TRY TO ACCELERATE NAM. THE THE PROGRAM DESIGN. ELEMENTS OR ASPECTS OF ANY PROGRAMS THAT WE WISH TO FIND GOING FORWARD. AND I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WANTED TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S A SATURATION DYNAMIC. IS THERE A IS THERE A POINT WHERE. MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE SATURATED OR. IS THERE SUCH A. STILL ONGOING. NEED. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WELL I THINK I'M ONE OF THE ASPECTS THAT DEFINITELY THERE ISN'T. AN ISSUE A SATURATION HOUSE TO DO WITH THE MULTI FAMILY AS AND ME VERY IN A LOT OF LOW INCOME. INDIVIDUALS LIVING MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS AND WE HAVE NOT HAD A A PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SO THAT'S DEFINITELY. OVERSUBSCRIBED AND AND THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEED THERE ARE THE SAME WITH THE SOLAR PEAVEY. AND THOSE ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT NOW ARE DOING. REALLY WELL AND THAT THAT CHALLENGE WITH THE MULTI FAMILY IT LOOKS ON PAPER THAT BECAUSE THE EXPENDITURES ARE BEING REPORTED. THAT THERE IT'S NOT HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH BUT THE DOLLARS ARE COMMITTED INTO PROJECTS BUT WE DON'T REPORT THOSE UNTIL THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED SO THOSE DOLLARS ARE COMMITTED AND THEY'RE BEING USED BUT WE DON'T WANT TO. HAVE IT SHOWN AS AN EXPENDITURE AND UNTIL THE PROJECT IS COMPLETE AND THAT TAKES. TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. WITHOUT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN BUT ONE OF THE THANK YOU'S DIRECTOR ACCEPTED A DIRECTOR FOR COMING DOWN TO FRESNO. OFTENTIMES THAT WE FELT LIKE WE GET OVERLOOKED IN IT WAS NICE TO HAVE YOU COME TO MY BACKYARD SO THANK. YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHEN YOU'RE READY AYE GOOD AFTERNOON. PARK BECKLEY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES HERE WITH ME TODAY IS IRENE BREAKS HIS OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION. THE DEPARTMENT CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES.

AND THOSE MEASURES ARE PATERNITY ESTABLISHMENT COLLECTIONS ON CURRENT SUPPORT COLLECTIONS ON A REYES A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER IS ESTABLISHED AND ATTORNEYS ESTABLISHED. WHILE IN FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN OUR PERFORMANCE IS RELATIVELY FLAT. WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WERE SO WITH AND. OF THE TOP TWENTY. STATES AND TERRITORIES I'M ON THOSE FEDERAL FOR ITS MEASURES. WE ALSO HAVE CERTAIN STATE MEASURES THAT WE USE TO MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE THAT WE CALL PRACTICE INDICATORS. ON BETWEEN FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THAT WE'RE ABLE TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF. FAMILIES THAT PAY NINETY PERCENT OR MORE ON THEIR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS AND BY PERCENTAGE POINT AT TWO THIRTY NINE POINT THREE PERCENT. I'M ENTITLED ISSUE THE COLLECTIONS BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE INCREASE OUR COLLECTIONS BY TWENTY EIGHT MILLION OR ONE POINT TWO PERCENT. AND. IN TERMS HAVE. JUST REALLY COLLECTIONS FOR CASE SAID THE MONEY GOING DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES. REBEL INCREASED. OUR COLLECTIONS FOR CASE BY SEVENTY DOLLARS OR THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT. SO VERY MEANINGFUL TO OUR FAMILIES. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. SOME PAYMENT INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE LAUNCHED. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WE DECIDED TO EXPAND. PAYMENT OPTIONS TO ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. ESPECIALLY CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGOR IS TO ARE PART OF A CASH BASED ECONOMY. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE LAUNCHED HUMAN A PAYMENT SERVICES MONOGRAM AND. PAINTER ME. THESE ARE PAYMENT COUNTERS I CAN FIND IN A LOT OF RETAIL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M THROUGH THOSE PAYMENT METHODS AND FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN RAIL TO COLLECT THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. WE ALSO INSTALLED. ED PAYMENT KIOSKS AND OUR CHILD FOR AGENCIES. OF THOSE PAYMENT COUNT SEVEN LAST YEAR HAD COLLECTED FORTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. AND JUST RECENTLY RELAUNCHED A MANY PAYMENT SERVICE WHILE. NEW TO US PAYPAL AND THAT WAS ADDED TO OUR WEBSITE SO THAT OUR PUBLIC AREAS COULD PAY FOR THAT PAYMENT IS PAYMENT METHOD AS WELL. I'D NOW LIKE TO. CHARTED EVERTS YOU MISS BREAKS TO TALK ABOUT OUR ESTIMATE. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATES. DECSS ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL COLLECT TWO POINT FOUR SIX FIVE BILLION IN CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION OR ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.

NOW ALSO IN OUR ESTIMATE IS THE RECEIPT OF AN ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWOTHOUSAND. AND FEDERAL INCENTIVES BASED ON OUR PERFORMANCE ON THE FIVE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ILIO. INCOMES. ONE NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE ONE. SEEN NONO BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. YOU'D MENTIONED THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE HAS ARE THERE ANY THAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON EXPLICITLY TO IMPROVE MORE INTENSELY THAN OTHERS. WHAT WE? ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO IS REALLY FOCUS ON I'M DISPUTED COLLECTIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE BELIEVE THAT. EACH ONE OF THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES WILL BE AFFECTED IF WE FOCUS ON YESTERDAY COLLECTIONS ARE FAMILIES. SO WHETHER IT'S COLLECTIONS ON CURRENT SUPPORT COLLECTIONS ON A REYES SADDAM ESTABLISHING OUR CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS. ALL OF THOSE COULD HAVE BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY ISSUED COLLECTIONS BUT NOT ANYONE SPECIFICALLY ARE REALLY JUST LOOK OUT WE YOU KNOW WE WE. YOU KNOW IN THE COLLECTION MEASURES WE TEND TO DO PRETTY WELL ON PATERNITY ESTABLISHMENT SO WE DON'T PUT AS MUCH FOCUS ON THAT. BUT THE OTHER ONES ARE VERY INSTRUMENTAL. UNIT ALSO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE FOCUS ON DIFFERENT PRACTICES SUCH AS NEGOTIATED CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS. I'M RATHER THAN JUST HAVING WATERS GO BY DEFAULT PRESUMING THAT SOMEBODY HAS A MINIMUM WAGE JOB OR WORKS FORTY HOURS A WEEK. REALLY TRYING TO BRING BOTH PARENTS INTO THE OFFICE TO NEGOTIATE THOSE ORDERS WE FIND THAT THOSE ORDERS TEND TO PAY BETTER THAN ORDERS ESTABLISHED BY DEFAULT. YEAH. ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. I THINK WE NEED ONE MORE SPOT IF WE CAN. WE'LL START WITH CARRIE GILBERT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CARRIE GILBERT AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF FRESNO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. WE CALIFORNIA FORM THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS CENTRALIZED IN MORE UNIFIED. FOCUS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY THE FUTURE FUNDING METHODOLOGY AND STRUCTURE WAS LACKING. HERE WE ARE YEARS AFTER THE FORMATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND WE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT FUNDED. OUR LOCAL COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES ARE THE HEART OF THIS PROGRAM THIS IS TRULY WHERE THE DIRECT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THE FAMILIES. CHILD SUPPORT FAMILY OUR CHILD'S PER PROVIDES FAMILIES WITH MUCH NEEDED INCOME HELPING WITH THE BASIC LIFE NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD. SHELTER AND CLOTHING. OVER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FAMILIES OF FRESNO COUNTY FALL BELOW POVERTY LEVEL. AND OVER TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN LIVE IN FOOD INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS. I AM HERE TODAY IS ONE OF THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED. DUE TO RELATIVELY FLAT FUNDING AND INCREASED OPERATING COSTS OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. PRESIDENT COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT STAFFING REDUCTIONS. AND TWO THOUSAND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO REDUCE OUR STAFFING ALLOCATIONS BY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE POSITIONS. BRING US DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR ALLOCATIONS FOR OVER SIXTY THOUSAND CASES. THOUGH WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE EFFICIENT AND EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE MORE THAN NOT DUE TO OUR STAFFING LEVELS. WE'RE FORCED INTO REACTIONARY CASE WORK. ARE FRESNO COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT HAS DEMONSTRATED YEAR OVER YEAR. THAT IT IS A SOLID INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE GENERAL FUND. FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED ON OUR PROGRAM IT PRESIDENT COUNTY THE TOTAL DISTRIBUTED COLLECTIONS IS GREATER THAN FOUR DOLLARS. THIS INCLUDES RECRUITMENT TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND AND MONIES DIRECTLY TO THE FAMILIES WHICH HELPS WITH SELF SUFFICIENCY. AND COST AVOIDANCE. AND STATE FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FOR EVERY STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLAR THAT WAS PUT INTO FRESNO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. WE RECOUPED A DOLLAR THIRTY THREE FOR YOUR GENERAL FUND. WE GIVE YOU A BETTER RETURN ON YOUR MONEY THAN ANY SAVINGS ACCOUNT. I END WHERE I STARTED. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FLAT FUNDED FOR FAR TOO LONG. I AM HERE IS ONE OF THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES ASKING YOU TO INVEST IN US. FORTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF YOUR STATE GENERAL FUND MONIES. ANNUALLY. WITH THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER CORE SERVICES IN A MORE EFFICIENT AND EXPEDIENT MANNER. WE CAN INCREASE THE COLLECTIONS TO FAMILIES AND WE CAN INCREASE THE RECRUITMENT TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND. INVESTINGIN OUR FOURTEEN COUNTIES NOW IS TOO FULL. IT CREATES AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE THE SAME GREAT SERVICE LEVEL. AS OTHER COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES. AND IT ALSO SET A NEW BASELINE TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE FUTURE FUNDING METHODOLOGY AND STRUCTURE OF THIS PROGRAM. INVESTING AND CALIFORNIA'S TILES WERE PROGRAM IS A SOLID INVESTMENT OF YOUR STATE GENERAL FUNDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU MISTER GILBERT NEXT WE HAVE LAURIE. ALSO GIVEN US THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAURIE CREWS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. I LEAD ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DEDICATED CHILD SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS IN THE WORK OF DELIVERING CRITICAL CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN FAMILIES WHERE PRIVILEGE SERVE. IT IS FOR OUR STAFF AND CUSTOMERS AT MY COLLEAGUES IN I FOR REQUESTING. FORTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR USE IN OUR FOURTEEN COUNTIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COR SERVICES HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE FLAT FUNDING WE HAVE RECEIVED. FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO SERVING THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CHILDREN STILL IN NEED. LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN INCREASE TO THEIR BASE ALLOCATIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO. OUR COSTS HAVE RISEN HUNDRED NINETEEN PERCENT. STAFF SALARIES HAVE INCREASED AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY SIX PERCENT. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME OUR ALLOCATION HAS RISEN ONLY ONE PERCENT. CAN YOU IMAGINE PAIN YOUR HOUSEHOLD BILLS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WITH THE SCENT SAME INCOME YOU MADE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES ARE PROGRAM IS ONE OF THE BEST INVALID VESTMENTS FOR STATE FUNDING. FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED THE PROGRAM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MATCHES IT WITH TO. IN FACT FOR THE FORTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WE ARE REQUESTING. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL MATCH IT WITH EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION. THAT WILL BE ALLOCATED DIRECTLY TO THE MOST UNDER FUNDED TRANSFERRED AGENCIES. JUST AS IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT OUR PROGRAM. IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CHILDHOOD POVERTY. RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT CHILD SUPPORT HELPS FAMILIES IN NEED TO REDUCE THEIR RELIANCE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. AS MONTHLY CHILD SUPPORT TYPICALLY ACCOUNTS FOR FORTY PERCENT OF MONTHLY INCOME FOR FRAGILE FAMILIES. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN COUNT ON ADDITIONAL COST AVOIDANCE SAVINGS. OF NEARLY FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT MAY BE USED FOR OTHER STATE PROJECTS. IN RETURN FOR THIS INVESTMENT. WE COMMIT TO FOCUS WORK ON REDUCING DELAYS THAT AFFECT THE FAMILIES WE SERVE. WE ALSO ANTICIPATE INCREASING TOTAL COLLECTIONS. FIVE PERCENT FOR EACH OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE INVESTMENT AND THEN TEN PERCENT FOR YEARS THREE THROUGH FIVE. THIS INCREASING COLLECTIONS WILL BENEFIT FAMILIES AND REIMBURSES STATES GENERAL FUND. LAST WEEK WE HAD OUR HEARING IN FRONT OF THE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. SENATOR PAN ASKED US TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. ON A WHOLE LISTA CONSISTING OF A FUNDING PLAN. WITH OUR ASSOCIATION LEADING THE EFFORT. WE MET THIS PAST MONDAY WILL MEET SEVERAL MORE TIMES OVER THE NEXT WEEK AND HALF. IF WE ARE VERY WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR ASSOCIATION. ON A LONG TERM FUNDING PLAN. THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. FIRST WE NEED A PATCH FOR OUR FOURTEEN COUNTIES. THAT ONE ABLE US TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS DESERVE. AND WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR COMMITTEE IS PRESENT WITH MANY VALID AND NECESSARY REQUEST. FOR FUNDING. AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH US THAT CHILD SUPPORT IS NOT ONLY A GOOD INVESTMENT. FOR THE STATE BUT THAT OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES BENEFITTED. FROM AN ACTIVE ENGAGED LOCAL TRANSPORT OFFICE FOR. I ALSO WANTED THEM NOTE THAT EACH OF YOU HAS. A BINDER THAT WE HAVE PREPARED. THAT INDICATES THE. PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION MORE PERSPECTIVE. AS WELL AS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU MISS CRUZ AND NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND. IF I MAY I JUST WANTED TO START BY ACTUALLY THANKING YOU FOR MEETING WITH THE. ADVOCATES DIRECTLY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US BUT WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE UPCOMING MEETINGS AND WHAT'S PLANNED DURING THEM I THINK YOU MADE ON APRIL NINETEENTH. TWENTY FOURTH AND TWENTY SIXTH AND I WANTED TO KNOW IF. THERE WAS A PLAN OR ATTENDANCE FOR THOSE CRACKED AS. MISTER CHAIR. THE I'M DEPARTMENT SELLS SUPPORT SERVICES IS I'M WORKING IN A COORDINATION WITH VLC ESSAYS. ON THE STAKEHOLDER QUEST. I SHOULD STATE THAT THIS ISN'T AND ADMINISTRATION SPONSORED. PROPOSAL A WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE PROPOSAL I'M AT THIS MOMENT. HOWEVER WE ARE. MEETING PROVIDING I'M TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WORKGROUP. I THINK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE IF NEW MONEY IS TO BE ADDED IN FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. UP WE ARE LOOKING FOR MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO. THAT THE ISSUE. IN TERMS OF HOW ANY NEW FUNDING WOULD BE SPREAD ACROSS AN EFFECT ALL TRANSPORT AGENCIES. I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS ON THE FOURTEEN. UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES. BUT REALLY LOOKING FOR THAT LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE. ALSO SOMETHING THAT'S PERFORMANCE BASED IS IMPORTANT SO WHAT OUTCOMES WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TOM I DO THINK THAT THE WORK GROUP. MEETING THAT WE HAD ON MONDAY WAS VERY PRODUCTIVE I'M A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS THAT WERE SHARED AND EVERYONE'S KEEPING AN OPEN MIND IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AND MODELS. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONLY OPENING COMMENTS ON THE SHE TOOK. I JACQUI AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WAS MENTIONED WITH THE WORK GROUPS WERE ALSO MAKING OUR BEST EFFORT TO ATTEND THOSE WORK GROUPS I'M PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT I MAY BE NEEDED AND JUST OBSERVING. ANYTHING THAT COMES UP IN THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE. PUBLISHED WAS WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A WORLD'S PARTICIPATING WHEN WE CAN IN THESE. MEETINGS AND WE'RE ALSO HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. FRESNO KERN. SAN JOAQUIN MERCED AND STANISLAUS FIVE OF THE UNDER FUNDED COUNTIES THINK OVERLY TO STRAIGHT DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OUT. TO A LOS ANGELES RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO THEY'VE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY A SINCE THE FALL TO PUT TOGETHER A PROPOSAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THEY'VE DEVOTED AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF TIME ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS JUST AS THE. SENATE AUTHENTIC WILL MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD IS THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG APPROACH BECAUSE THERE ARE A COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT UNDER FUNDED. AND TO TALK ABOUT A REDISTRIBUTION OF EXISTING RESOURCES MEANS THAT WE'RE JUST MAKING THE WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WE UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TO HAVE A. SENSIBLE RATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE DOLLARS I THINK IN ORDER TO DO THAT. WE NEED NEW ODD NEWS NEW RESOURCES TO THE FOURTEEN IN ORDER TO HAVE A A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. THAT EVERYBODY CAN LIVE WITH SO WE ASK FOR ME RESOURCES FOR THEM AND I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMITMENT IS APPARENT TO EVERYBODY THAT THEY WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT ALEJO. FINANCE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR ALL FIFTY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR STAFF TIME ON THIS ISSUE. THANK HIM. SEARCH OUR MEMBERS JOIN OF OR SOME PATH URBAN CARRIES A CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS ADDITIONAL FORTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR THE UNDER FROM THE COUNTIES. SIX OF WHICH URBAN COUNTIES A FRESNO LOS ANGELES RIVERSIDE SACRAMENTO STEINBERG DEAN ON SAN JOAQUIN. THIS UP FUNDING PROVIDES AS YOU FOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES CAN HELP REDUCE POVERTY AND HELP SELF SUFFICIENCY. NAM WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ALSO A STRONG RETURN INVESTMENT TO THE STATE. WE ALSO ARE INVOLVED IN THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND PROCESS AND I THINK THAT PAT DID MAKE GOOD PROGRESS ON MONDAY. HOWEVER I AGREE WITH THE SLANG THAT AS LISTS STAY AT THE SENATE HEARING WE NEED TO BRING OUT ACCOUNT IS UP TO THE SAME OF YOU EVEN LITTLE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BEFORE WE START TALKING ABOUT. A FORMULA METHODOLOGIES BECAUSE AND THIS IS GOING TO CREATE NEW WHERE SOME LOSERS AND PROBABLY MOST COUNTY WOULDN'T AGREE TO THAT SO I THINK WE NEED TO. CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FROM FIRST TO HAVE THAT COMMITMENT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A LONGER FROM THE DISCUSSION OVER THE SUMMER. COMMON THAT OUT BUT THAT WERE IN SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE YOUR AND INTEREST AND ATTENTION THANK YOU THANK HIM. JUSTIN GOT CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THAT WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS FUNDING PROPOSAL AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE APPROACH OF PROVIDED A NEW INVESTMENTS.

THANKS THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M VERONICA RILEY THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY ONE OF THE FOURTEEN. ADD JUST LAST WEEK A NEW STUDY WAS RELEASED ON CHILD POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE MAY HAVE SEEN IT. DATA FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE BOTH REVEALED THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF BOTH CHILDHOOD. AND ADULT POVERTY IN THE ENTIRE NATION. THE JUSTICE POVERTY RATE IS TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WHICH EQUATES TO OVER TWO MILLION KIDS. AMONG THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDRESSING THE POVERTY ISSUE IS AND I QUOTE CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. THAT WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS AND ENSURE THAT SUPPORT REACHES THE FAMILIES THAT NEED IT. SINCE THE FOURTEEN UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES MAKE UP ALMOST SEVENTY PERCENT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE. ENTIRE CHILD SUPPORT CASELOAD IN CALIFORNIA. AND INVESTMENT IN THESE COUNTIES WOULD STRENGTHEN OUR PROGRAMS AND WILL MOST CERTAINLY GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURING THAT THE FAMILIES WHO NEED THE SUPPORT RECEIVER SERVICES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM. HI AM TIME YOU MORE ON THE DIRECTOR OF TAME A COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. MY STAFF AND I ARE PASSIONATELY ENGAGED IN THE WORK THAT WE DO IN WORKING WITH PARENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CHILDREN. WE CONSTANTLY EVALUATE HOW WE CAN HELP MAKE CHILD SUPPORT A MORE RELIABLE SOURCE OF INCOME. IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE FOR SINGLE LOW INCOME FAMILIES CHILD SUPPORT IS FORTY PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL INCOME. FOR THE SEVERELY IMPOVERISHED IT MAKES UP APPROXIMATELY SIXTY PERCENT. TO GIVE FAMILIES THE SERVICE LAKE LEVEL THEY DESERVE ALL COUNTIES MUST BE APPROPRIATELY FUNDED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT STAFFING LEVELS THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. ATTY GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY I'M DIDN'T AGREE SHELVE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND CASES THAT'S TO UNDER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES WE SERVE. IT'S ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THE ENTIRE STATE LOAD CASELOAD. WE PROJECT THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA COLLECT OVER ONE HALF BILLION DOLLARS ON BEHALF OF THOSE FAMILIES. I AM A BUDGET OF A HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. WE GET FROM STATE OF FEDERAL OF SOURCES ONLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION. THAT A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT GAP IS MOSTLY BRIDGED BY THE RATHER UNIQUE. AND GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THAT SAID THERE ARE TWO YEARS AGO I UNFUNDED EIGHTY POSITIONS THIS YEAR I'M IN FUNDING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS. WITH FLAT FUNDING I PROJECT TO ON FUND DOZENS OF POSITIONS IN THE COMING YEAR. A FIRST TO BE A ANTI POVERTY FOR SOME BEHALF OF CHILDREN AND BEHALF OF FAMILIES OF THAT CAN SUSTAIN ITSELF THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SARAH HONEY CAT NAM THE DIRECTOR OF TO. AMADOR COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT AND I HAVE TO ADMIT PUBLIC SPEAKING IS ONE OF MY GREATEST FEARS AND I'M STANDING HERE. I'M STANDING HERE BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM ONE OF THOSE FOURTEEN. I HAVE A CASE LOAD OF SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED CASES AND A THIRD OF THOSE ARE RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. AB TWENTY NINE STAFF AT THIS TIME THIRTY INCLUDING MYSELF. WE WANT. WHO WE KNOW THAT IF ADDITIONAL FUNDING? WE WOULD IT BE BETTER ABLE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY BY WORKING THOSE CASES WITH MORE HUMAN INTERVENTION STAFFING WILL ALLOW US TO WORK WITH PARENTS TO GET RIGHT SIZE ORDERS. DO MORE EARLY INTERVENTION AND WORK ON CASES AND PARENTS IN HELPING THEM TO FIND RESOURCES FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I BELIEVE. WITH ADDITIONAL STAFFING WE MAY BE ABLE TO MOVE SOME OF THE CURRENTLY EIGHTY CASES TO THE FORMALLY AIDED. AND THEN CHILD SUPPORT THEN BECOMES COST AVOIDANCE PROGRAM. WHICH ISN'T IMPORTANT TO. THE ENTIRE BUDGET. ALL CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOCATION SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME CARE ACROSS THE STATE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. A HUMAN AND YOU DID GREAT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARIEKE A LATIN I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR THE SAN BERNADINO DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES.

AND SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS ON FATHER'S NOT PRESENT THIS INCREASES TO FORTY FOUR PERCENT AND HAS NOT DECREASED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THESE OTHER FAMILIES THAT NEED OUR SERVICES TO ESTABLISH AND COLLECT CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE CHILD SUPPORT. WHAT WE ARE VERY COST EFFECTIVE COLLECTING FOUR DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS? WE HAVE THE LOWEST ALLOCATION BY CASE YET THE SECOND LARGEST CASELOAD IN THE STATE. I CASE WORKERS UNABLE TO PROACTIVELY WORK CASES BY WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH ARE NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS WE CAN HELP THEM TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND GET THEM ON THE PATH. TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT CONSISTENTLY. ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ALLOW SANDRA DINO TO PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICE TO OUR FAMILIES AS IN OTHER COUNTIES. WE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ENGAGE OUR CUSTOMERS EARLY ON PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO HOLISTICALLY HELP OUR CUSTOMERS. AND CONDUCT OUT REACHING COMMUNITIES WHERE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A PRESENCE. THIS PROACTIVE APPROACH WILL ENSURE EVERY CHILD GETS THE SERVICE AND SUPPORT THEY NEED AND ULTIMATELY SHIFT THE CYCLE OF POVERTY IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. TERRY HARDY PORTER TO SACRAMENTO COUNTY TO A CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTOR AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF WHY I AM IN SUPPORT OF THAT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SACRAMENTO COUNTY. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OUR CASELOAD IS BASICALLY STAYED THE SAME ABOUT A THREE PERCENT CHAINS DECREASE OUR FUNDING HAS BEEN FLAT. R. F. T. E. IS AUTHORIZED LEFTIES HAVE DECREASED BY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. YOU CANNOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE A CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH IS ANTI POVERTY ANTI CHILD POVERTY. WITH A TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT DECREASE IN STAFFING RESOURCES WE KNOW THAT THE ECONOMY IS CHANGING. OUR CASELOAD IS CHANGING WE'RE LOOKING FOR FAMILIES AND PARENTS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE GIG ECONOMY WE'RE LOOKING FOR PARENTS WHO ARE WORKING SHORT TERM CONTRACT WORK. THAT TAKES HUMAN RESOURCES IN OUR COUNTY. EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT OF OUR CASE LOAD IS CURRENTLY ASSISTED OR FORMALLY ASSISTANT THEY ARE THE HARDEST TO SERVE. AND THAT TAKES HUMAN RESOURCES WITH THE TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT DECREASE IN F. T. E.'S WE ARE UNABLE TO ACTUALLY SERVE THOSE FAMILIES WHO ARE IN THE MOST NEED. I AM URGING YOU. PORT. I HAD THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DON MARRON ON THE TRACTOR GLENN COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. IN GOING COUNTY WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN OUR FISH SINCE HE'S BE COST EFFECTIVE FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT IN OUR PROGRAM WE BRING IN OVER FOUR DOLLARS. WE AND DURING THE TIME WE MAINTAIN PERFORMANCE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE LOST FORTY PERCENT OF OUR STAFF. AND THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LOSE MORE IN THE COMING YEARS. THE PARTICIPANTS WE CURRENTLY SERVE COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. SOME WORK IN THE GAG IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. THERE UNBANKED THEY HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND HAVE DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING THE LEGAL SYSTEM. WITHOUT THE CASEWORKER INTERVENTION. AND THE RICH RESOURCES TO DO THEIR JOB THE LEVEL OF SERVICE COULD BE AFFECTED WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO OUR FAMILIES. CURRENTLY SEVENTY NINE PERCENT OF OUR CASELOAD IS NEVER INFORMALLY ASSISTANT. THE COLLECTIONS WE MAKE ON BEHALF OF THESE CASES GO DIRECTLY TO THE FAMILIES. WITHOUT THE CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD SHELTER AND CLOTHING WILL NOT BE MET. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU THANK HIM. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SURE MORE THEY'LL TRY HO THE DIRECTOR OF THE MERCED MARIPOSA REGIONAL DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. WITH OVER TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY MERCED COUNTY IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE CENTER OF POVERTY. TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN ARE OUR COMMUNITY LIVE IN POVERTY. AS A RURAL COUNTY STILL RECOVERING FROM THE RECENT RECESSION. THE RESIDENTS OF MERCED COUNTY RELY UPON THE COLLECTIONS OBTAINED BY OUR DEPARTMENT TO CREATE STABLE HOMES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AS A POVERTY PREVENTION TOOL AS YOU HEARD BY MY COLLEAGUES MERCED COUNTY DISTRIBUTES EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COLLECTIONS DIRECTLY FAMILIES. THESE DIRECT DOLLARS ENABLE SELF SUFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE STATE RETURN ON INVESTMENT BY COST AVOIDANCE A PROFESSION. TANGIBLE PUBLIC SERVICES AS WELL AS RECRUITMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES ADOPT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE DOLLARS EXPENDED. INVESTMENT IN OUR PROGRAM RESULT IN IMMEDIATE FEDERAL DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION OF TWO DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR CONTRIBUTED TO WORK BY OUR STATE. OUR CONTINUED FLAT FUNDING LIMITS MERCED'S ABILITY TO ACTIVELY WORK THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PLUS CASES OUR CASELOAD. THE DEPARTMENT HAS SEEN A FORTY SIX PERCENT DECREASE IN STAFFING SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. AT OUR LOCAL COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN DECLINING RESULTING IN A LOSS OF MILLIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AND INVESTMENT IN OUR PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY AN INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE BUT ALSO FOR THE CAN COMMUNITY WE SERVE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S CHUCK APOLOGIES OUT 12-1 WITH THE STANISLAUS DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM WILL BE MORE THAN THREE FOLD A STANISLAUS GENERATED THREE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON THE PROGRAM I SHARE. NOT RECEIVING ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF POTENTIAL COLLECTIONS AND LONGER WAIT TIMES FOR SERVICES FOR FAMILIES WHO RELY ON CHILD SUPPORT AS A REAL INCOME. AND ALSO WOULD RESULT IN UNREALIZED RECRUITMENT BACK TO THE STATE FEDERAL AND COUNTY AGENCIES. FOR SOME FAMILIES IN OUR CASE LOAD THE ADDITIONAL CHILD SUPPORT MEANS HEALTHIER FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND FOR OTHERS IT HAS BECOME THE SAVINGS THEY NEEDED FOR A CHILD'S COLLEGE EDUCATION HAVING WILL WORK MULTIPLE JOBS TO RAISE THE CHILD. FOR OTHERS IT'S MEDICAL SUPPORT THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAVE. IN ALL ASPECTS AND I COUNTY WHERE APPROXIMATELY ONE FOURTH OF CHILDREN LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL CHILD SUPPORT PROVIDE SOME FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE RECRUITMENT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT HELPING OFFSET COSTS AND REDUCING RELIANCE ON ALREADY TIGHT FUNDING FOR OTHER PROGRAMS WHILE ENABLING CHILD SUPPORT TO BE RECOGNIZED AND EFFECTIVE PARTNER. IN THE SAFETY NET AND POVERTY PREVENTION NETWORK OF AGENCIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.

WITH MAYBE MENTAL HEALTH OR DRUG ADDICTION ISSUES. GET OVER THOSE ISSUES SO THAT THE WAY THEY CAN BE A SOLID PART OF THEIR CHILD'S LIFE AND ALSO A PROVIDE THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT. COME WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE. MANY OTHER AVENUES IN TERMS WE'D LIKE TO PROVIDE EXTENDED HOURS WE'D LIKE TO PROVIDE MOBILE SERVICES. YOU LIKE IT'S A COUNTY LIKE SANDRA DINO OR KERN COUNTY THAT SO LARGE. ITS TOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW DRIVE FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTY TO BAKERSFIELD OR TO SALMON MEDINA. SAID THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE A MOBILE SERVICE AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY SO THAT WAY THEY CAN REACH EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS HELP SUPPORT SERVICES. SO THAT'S IN TERMS OF THE. WHAT WE? ARE THINKING IN WE NEED TO DO WITH THE MONEY. IN TERMS OF OUTPUTS WE THINK THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF. THINK THERE'S GREAT POTENTIAL. IN US BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICES THAT. SO FAR WE HAVEN'T BEEN WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO WE WOULD LIKE TO DO. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CASES THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO. ON JUST BECAUSE SO MANY CASES THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT AMENABLE TO THE AUTOMATED SERVICES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO OPEN A CASE IS SOMETIMES IT TAKES. A LOT OF WORK DETECTIVE WORK I WOULD SAY TO FIND AND TO FIND INCOME ORDER FIND AN EMPLOYER. YOU NEED A PERSON IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED A PERSON TO ANALYZE THOSE RESULTS. WE'D LIKE TO LOOK IT UP REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES FROM WHEN YOU OPEN THE CASE TO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET A PAYMENT. RIGHT NOW I THINK THE STATE WIDE AVERAGES OVER TWO HUNDRED DAYS. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU HAD TO GO IN AND YOU REQUESTED SERVICES. YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING BACK FOR NEAR FROM MORE THAN HALF A YEAR. SOME. THAT'S REALLY. UP A TERRIBLE STAND ON OUR PROGRAM WE WANT TO REDUCE THAT AND WE THINK WITH ADDITIONAL CASEWORKERS. WE'D BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND AND OF COURSE THE OTHER THING THAT WE THINK THAT WE COULD DO TREMENDOUSLY WITH THE MONEY IS TO INCREASE. ADDITIONAL COLLECTIONS. THAT ARE FOURTEEN COUNTIES COULD PRODUCE WE ALSO THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE. AND ADDITIONAL EFFORT BECAUSE OF FILE WERE ABLE TO BRING HIM THE MONEY AND AND WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INNOVATIVE SERVICES. WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE THOSE BEST PRACTICES TO ARE COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO RETHINK THAT THERE MAY ALSO BE AN ABILITY TO INCREASE COLLECTIONS STATEWIDE AS WELL. I WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND A BIT MORE FOR CAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT WHY WERE IN THIS STAGE I. BELIEVE IT'S OF BUDGETING METHODOLOGY AND THAT SPACE ALLOCATION THAT'S JUST STATUTORILY FROM MANY YEARS AGO. AND I'M. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE WAS ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO MOVE THE. UP TO SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS WAS THERE ANY. DISCUSSION ABOUT DISPLACING DOLLARS FROM COUNTIES WHO ARE ABOVE THAT. I ONLY ASK. AND DO BELIEVE THAT. ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A HOLD HARMLESS POLICY BUT WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND IF THOSE DISCUSSIONS DID HAPPEN. SURE I MISTER. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL. DISCUSSIONS SINCE THE PROGRAM. WAS REFORMED. AROUND BUDGET ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY I THINK SOME OF THE CURRENT. DISPARITY AND COSTS AMONG THE LC ESSAYS ARE FUNDING AMONG THE ALSO SAY'S HAS TO DO WITH. HISTORICAL FUNDING FORMULAS UNDER THE DA'S OFFICES COUNTIES COULD CONTRIBUTE VARYING LEVELS OF COUNTY SHARES AND TO ANSWER THOSE COUNTIES. THAT INVESTED MORE IN THEIR CHILD'S FOR PROGRAMS AND TO DO BETTER THAN THOSE WHO INVEST IT LASTS. AND THERE'S ALSO FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD SOMETHING HALL THE THIRTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT FUNDING FORMULA. THAT BASICALLY GAVE THE COUNTIES AND ALLOCATION BASED ON THIRTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT OF THEIR COLLECTIONS. SAVE YOUR. I COUNTY WITH SAY MORE AFFLUENT CASE LADY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ALLOCATION THOSE ARE LESS AFFLUENT HAVE LOWER ALLOCATIONS. THAT FUNDING FOR MILLET WAS SUSPENDED TWO THOUSAND THREE FORM BECAUSE IT WAS CREATING SUCH DISPARITIES AMONG THE COUNTIES. AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK. THE DEPARTMENT AS CONVENED A NUMBER OF WORK GROUPS TO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES. SAM YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE GROUPS THAT STRUGGLE TO REACH CONSENSUS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY BUDGET METHODOLOGY PUT PLACE. AND THEN THERE IS THE ISSUE THAT YOU POINTED TO THAT IF THERE WASN'T THE IF THERE WAS AN NEW FUNDING INTRODUCED INTO THE SYSTEM. AND YOU HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS RANDY ALLOCATIONS YOU WOULD HAVE THOSE WINNERS AND LOSERS DISCUSSIONS. AND I THINK THE CONCERN IS IS THAT WOULD. KICK CRATE GROSS DISRUPTIONS AMONG THE SYSTEM. SO IF YOU'RE A COUNTY WHO'S MORE ADEQUATELY FUNDED. AND YOU TRANSFER YOU KNOW FUNDING TO AN UNDERFUNDED COUNTY WHAT IS THAT DUE TO YOUR IN HOUSE STAFFING AND YOUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES. ESPECIALLY IN A FIVE FUNDING SCENARIO WHERE COAL IS WILL CONTINUE TO EAT AWAY AT YOUR PROGRAM FUNDING. EVENTUALLY WHERE DOES IT BUT THOSE COUNTIES WHO ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED EVENTUALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'LL BE UNDER FUNDED THEMSELVES. SO I THINK IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS REALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON A MORE HOLISTIC SOLUTION. TROY ADDRESS FUNDING ISSUES. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW FOR THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE AND ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY THAT WORKS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES. I SAW OFFERING SUMMER. FOR THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES. WE USE THE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS COST PER CASE METHODOLOGY BECAUSE IT WAS AN OBJECTIVE WAY. TO TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM HOWEVER FOR THE FOURTEEN I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE VERY FLEXIBLE. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE METHODOLOGY. SHOULD BE AND COULD BE SO. IN. I THINK THERE'S MANY WAYS. THAT THAT METHODOLOGY COULD BE CALCULATED. COST PER CASES ONE AND COST PER FTE IS ANOTHER BUT I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT WERE VERY FLEXIBLE. IN TERMS OF HOW THAT METHODOLOGY CANON SHOULD LOOK IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. OUR COMMITTEE IS GOING TO WANT THOUGH LOOKING TO LOOK AT THIS HOLISTIC. RESULT AFTERWARDS AND WILL HOPE THAT YOU INCLUDE US AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THESE NEXT THREE MEETINGS SO THAT WE CAN DELIVERY. WHO TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF TIMING IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO? COME TO SOME RESOLUTION BEFORE MAY REVISE OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO GO PAST THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND IT YOU KNOW I'M KIND OF AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS INTO THIS ISN'T AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS. I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO TURN TO OTHER CSTA ARE ONE OF THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES REALLY SPEAK TO. WHERE THEY SEE THIS GOING? SO OUR OUR. CONVERSATIONS AFTER THE LAST BUDGET. MEETING WORD THAT WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO PRODUCE SOMETHING. TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISED BUDGET. YES I GOT SOME CSK PRESENT. FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SAID OUR GOAL IS TO HAVETHESE THREE MEETINGS THE FOLLOWING WEEK RIGHT SOME I MEAN HAVE YOU SPEAK INTO THE MIKE JUST SO THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOT. PRESENT TODAY ARE. SORT OF ON THAT. OUR GOAL IS TO FINISH THESE THREE MEETINGS. UP A WEEK FROM TO MORROW AND THEN HAVE SOMETHING WRITTEN UP THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND SUBMITTED TO THE CONSULTANTS ARE ON MAY SEVENTH. THANK YOU WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THAT UPDATE AND SEEING. MR JUST AND I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS AT SOME POINT CAN WE CONSIDER THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THE MEETINGS ARE IMPORTANT ALL OF THAT. BY THAT IT'S REAL LIVES THERE WERE AFFECTING HERE AND THAT THERE IS FOR ME THAT'S URGENCY. AYE AS INDICATED BY BY. YOU KNOW THE TESTIMONY HOWEVER IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT SOMETIMES AND SOMEONE MAKE SURE THAT WE. WHEN WE SUBMIT THIS IS NOT JUST SOME LINE ITEM THIS IS REAL KIDS THAT ARE BEING EFFECTIVE AFFECTED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WILL. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE WITH THE MONEY OR THE LACK THEREOF SO IF WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS ALSO. INTERJECTED IN THE LATTER AND. THAT SENT TO OF BEFORE THE MAY REVISE. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND CONCLUDE TODAY'S SOMEONE HEARING THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING HERE
