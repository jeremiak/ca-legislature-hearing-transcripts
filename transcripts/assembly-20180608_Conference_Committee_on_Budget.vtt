WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT I WOULD

01:57:33.379 --> 01:57:34.881
CALL A BUMPER CROP.

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:36.182
HAVING GONE THROUGH SOME PRETTY

01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:37.717
ROUGH YEARS.

COUNTIES BY POPULATION IN THE

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:44.157

01:57:44.223 --> 01:57:46.392
IT'S KIND OF NICE TO BE. IN THIS

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:47.393
POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE A LITTLE

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.595
EXTRA MONEY AS OPPOSED TO MAKING.

01:57:49.662 --> 01:57:50.997
LAYOFFS OF ABOUT A THOUSAND

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:53.266
PEOPLE.

01:57:53.332 --> 01:57:54.901
SO EQUITIES ARE UP UNEMPLOYMENT

01:57:54.967 --> 01:57:56.436

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:58.805
AND IT SEEMS THAT WHEN YOU GET

01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:00.206
A LITTLE BIT OF A BONUS WE

01:58:00.273 --> 01:58:01.774
SHOULD BE PAYING DOWN OUR CREDIT

01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:03.709
CARD BALANCES.

01:58:03.776 --> 01:58:05.211
OR WE SHOULD BE PUTTING FUNDS

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.779
ASIDE.

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:08.481
THAT'S A GOOD THING WE'RE DOING

01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:10.116
THAT IN THIS BUDGET.

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:11.384
BUT BUT PAYING DOWN A LITTLE

01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:12.685
MORE ON OUR PENSION PLAN

01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:16.689

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:16.889
NOW.

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:17.924
LIABILITIES REP TO NINETY ONE

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.891
POINT FIVE BILLION IN.

01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:20.359
WE'LL BE STARING US IN THE FACE

01:58:20.426 --> 01:58:22.161

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:23.830
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BALANCE SHEET

01:58:23.896 --> 01:58:25.932
WHEN IT COMES OUT NEXT SPRING.

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:28.167
THAT'S MY CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:29.769
WHOLE THE WHOLE PROCESS IS THE

01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:32.605
BIGGER PICTURE IN. AND SO.

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:34.340
IF WE WERE TO PAY DOWN A

01:58:34.407 --> 01:58:36.175
PENSION PLAN LIABILITY THAT THAT

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:37.977
THAT SEVEN PERCENT INTEREST

01:58:38.044 --> 01:58:39.178
BECAUSE IRAQ WILL BE EARNING. AS

01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:40.480
OPPOSED TO.

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:41.814
YOU KNOW LESS THAN A HALF A

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:42.615
PERCENT RIGHT NOW IS IT

01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:44.283
LANGUISHES IN THAT THE STATE

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:45.918
TREASURY.

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:47.053
SO I WANT TO IMPROVE THE BALANCE

01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:49.755
SHEET SO THAT WOULD BE SOME OF

01:58:49.822 --> 01:58:52.124
MY BIASES AS. I APOLOGIZE FOR

01:58:52.191 --> 01:58:53.860
BEING WILL. MAYBE CAN

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:55.995
ULTRACONSERVATIVE OR MAYBE AS

01:58:56.062 --> 01:58:57.663
OBSERVING THE GLASS IS HALF.

01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:01.067
FULL. I'M BUT SOMETIMES I SIT I

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:02.935
THINK WE'RE DANCING ON THE DECK

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:04.270
OF THE DIKE TITANIC AND.

01:59:04.337 --> 01:59:05.471
SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE REAL

01:59:05.538 --> 01:59:06.606
CAREFUL WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:07.907
GOVERNOR.

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:09.375
WHEN HE SAYS WE NEED TO BE

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:10.710
PREPARED FOR THE NEXT RECESSION

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:12.378
BECAUSE HE AND I ARE OLD ENOUGH.

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:14.614
TO KNOW WE GO THROUGH THEM.

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.581
SO WITH THAT.

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:17.416
.

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:18.718
MISTER CHAIR THIS BUDGET IS

01:59:18.784 --> 01:59:20.353
DOING A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:22.455
IN A COULD DO MORE.

01:59:22.522 --> 01:59:23.856
SO WITH THAT I I JUST HAD ONE

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:26.192
QUESTION FOR YOU SINCE.

IT MADE HIM TO BE INTERESTING. A

01:59:30.396 --> 01:59:31.998
LAST MINUTE INTO THE NIGHT KINDA

01:59:32.064 --> 01:59:33.766

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:34.967
THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE.

01:59:35.034 --> 01:59:36.068
MORE.

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:38.170
.

01:59:38.237 --> 01:59:40.907
BUT WALKING IN THE DARK FOR ME.

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:43.609
NOTHING WAS CLEAR.

01:59:43.676 --> 01:59:45.278

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:26.012
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE ARE

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:26.646
EARNING OUTSIDE OF PROP NINETY

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:27.546
WHICH.

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:29.982
.

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:30.616
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LARGE CHUNK OF

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:31.584
THE BUDGET A SEPARATE FROM THAT

02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:33.686
THAT THE FINAL. EVALUATION OF

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:36.422
THAT HOME WE ARE IN DISCUSSION

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:38.224
ABOUT REALLY JUST FINE TUNING

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.892
THE ULTIMATE DETAILS OF OUR

02:01:39.959 --> 02:01:42.128
BUDGET. LARGE PART OF IT AGAIN

02:01:42.194 --> 02:01:43.329
GHOSTS WITHOUT SUBCOMMITTEE

02:01:43.396 --> 02:01:45.197
PROCESS THROUGH EXHAUSTIVE

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:46.565
DISCRETION IF YOU STICK TO OUR.

02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:48.968
OR SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE

02:01:49.035 --> 02:01:49.235
WHICH IS.

02:01:49.301 --> 02:01:51.037
DOCTOR ARAMBULA CHAIRS AYE IF

02:01:51.103 --> 02:01:53.039
YOU CAN TELL YOU ABOUT HOW MANY

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:54.140
HOURS AND HOURS.

02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:55.675
HEARINGS ON EVERY SINGLE ITEM

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:57.076
THEY HAVE NOT NOT HAVING HAVING

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:58.744
SAID IT A WHAT IT CONFERENCE

02:01:58.811 --> 02:01:59.812
COMMITTEE ITSELF COULD BE

02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:01.514
IMPROVED AYE I THINK ABSOLUTELY

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:02.148
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR

02:02:02.214 --> 02:02:05.084
IMPROVEMENT. I THINK THIS YEAR

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:07.319
ON. EVERY ETHNIC EVERY BUDGET IS

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:09.455
REALLY DEPENDENT ON HOW

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:11.757
DISCUSSIONS GO. TO AND HOW THAT

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.125
FEEDBACK IS DONE TO WEAR IT.

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:15.461
THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS ARE AND

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:16.495
HOW THAT.

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:18.664
DISCUSSION OR GOES THROUGH WHEN

02:02:18.731 --> 02:02:20.099
THIS YEAR DID SEEM TO BE A

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:20.966
LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THE

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:21.967
PREVIOUS TWO YEARS THAT I'VE

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:23.869
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE BUDGET. ON

02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:26.038
THINK THERE VARIETY OF FACTORS I

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:28.107
DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM ARE.

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:29.975
TOM YOU KNOW ARE ANY OF THEM ARE

02:02:30.042 --> 02:02:30.609
SOME THINGS THAT WE WOULD CARRY

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:32.478
OVER TO NEXT YEAR. BUT I THINK

02:02:32.545 --> 02:02:33.612
IT'S JUST DEPENDENT ON WHERE THE

02:02:33.679 --> 02:02:34.947
WHERE THE HOUSES ARE AND WHERE

02:02:35.014 --> 02:02:35.848
THE GOVERNOR'S.

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:38.884
BUT AGAIN I THINK THE ARM BULK

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:40.252
OF THE BUDGET THIS IS WHAT I

02:02:40.319 --> 02:02:42.755
FIVE HAD NO NUMBER TOM RESOURCES

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:43.389
WITH RESTORED NOTED THAT. THE

02:02:43.456 --> 02:02:44.290
BULK OF THE BUDGET THE

02:02:44.356 --> 02:02:45.591
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THE

02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:47.860
DISCUSSION IS DONE AND THAT SUB

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:50.162
COMMITTEE. PROCESS. AND THAT IS

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:51.731
DONE THROUGH HOURS AND HOURS AND

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:53.432
HOURS A PAINSTAKING TESTIMONY

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:55.267
AND FEEDBACK AND IT'S SOMETHING

02:02:55.334 --> 02:02:55.668
THAT WE.

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:57.303
WILL TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY I KNOW

02:02:57.369 --> 02:02:58.637

02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:12.523
CALIFORNIA I THINK.

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:14.759
THERE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:16.761
ITEMS HERE EONS.

02:27:16.827 --> 02:27:18.229
.

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:19.530
SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:27:19.597 --> 02:27:21.065
OVERALL PRIORITIES.

02:27:21.132 --> 02:27:23.434
OF GENERAL FUND SPENDING IN THE

02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:25.903
STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET ITSELF.

02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:26.504
SO YOU THINK AT THE END OF THE

02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:27.905
DAY IT.

02:27:27.972 --> 02:27:29.674
SORT OF BALANCES OUT THE.

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:33.344
ONE TIME MONEY GOING TO UC'S.

02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:35.513
COMPARABLE TO THE ONGOING. GOT

02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:38.015
GOING TO THE CSU.

02:27:38.082 --> 02:27:39.383
I DON'T KNOW IF IT BALANCES OUT

02:27:39.450 --> 02:27:40.518
BETWEEN THE TWO SEGMENTS I THINK

02:27:40.585 --> 02:27:41.986
THAT FUNDAMENTALLY THEY SERVE

02:27:42.053 --> 02:27:43.287
VERY DIFFERENT STUDENTS AND.

02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:45.356
DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF STUDENTS

02:27:45.423 --> 02:27:47.024
CANDIDLY BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS.

02:27:47.091 --> 02:27:49.227
I THINK THAT IT BALANCES THE

02:27:49.293 --> 02:27:50.328
OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET

02:27:50.394 --> 02:27:52.029
IN WHICH

02:27:52.096 --> 02:27:53.364
ALL WE WANTED TO LIMIT OUR

02:27:53.431 --> 02:27:56.767
ONGOING RESOURCES AND BUILD UP.

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:58.069
PRETTY.

02:27:58.135 --> 02:27:59.136
ROBUST RESERVE FUNDS.
