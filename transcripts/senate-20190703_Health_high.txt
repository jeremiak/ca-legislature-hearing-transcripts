WE WILL DO SO OKAY AND NEXT YOU WANT TO TAKE UP. NOW YOU I TAKE OF EIGHTY OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU DOCTOR CHAIR AND SENATORS -- FIRST WANT TO THANK. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE -- AND STAFF FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. THERE ARE AMENDMENTS WE AGREED TO TAKE BUT DUE TO THE TIME CONSTRAINTS WILL BE TAKING THEM AND JUDICIARY A MOCK UP IS AVAILABLE WILL BE GETTING THAT MOCK UP OUT TO YOU -- AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR AIMS TO DETER WHAT IS KNOWN AS PAY FOR DELAY -- THESE ARE AGREEMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN GENERIC AND BRAND BY BRAND MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO DELAY MARKETING A GENERIC VERSION OF A DRUG FOR SOME VALUE. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR DOES THIS BY ESTABLISHING THE STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR THE COURTS TO USE WHEN REVIEWING PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS. THE BILL ESTABLISHES A PRESUMPTION THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE THE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE THAT THEN HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROOF APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT ARE PRO CONSUMER. THE EVER INCREASING COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CONTINUES TO IMPACT CALIFORNIA'S AND PAY FOR DELAY SETTLEMENTS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THESE UNCONTROLLABLE PRICES. THE SETTLEMENTS INHIBIT COMPETITION AND FORCE CONSUMERS PAY MORE WHILE DRUG COMPANIES -- PROFITS INCREASE COST CONTAINMENT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE AND HEALTH CARE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED COSTS AFFECT WHAT GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT EMPLOYERS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR JUST JUST THAT INSURES THAT CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO LOWER COST GENERIC DRUGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND HELP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE DRUG OF THE PRICE OF DRUGS FOR ALL PAYERS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE WITNESSES HERE WITH ME AND AND ALSO AT SOME TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS WELL. OKAY AND HOW ME WITNESSES ARE THEY'RE HERE. TO DO I CAN REMEMBER SIX MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU THEN OKAY WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS YES MAN PELLET HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WOULD CRACK DOWN ON COLUSA AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BRAND NAME DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND GENERIC COMPANIES IN WHICH THE BRAND NAME COMPANY PAYS THE GENERIC COMPANY TO DELAY THE LOWER COST DRUGS FROM COMING TO MARKET. MEMBERS WHAT IS THE POINT IN CREATING LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS IF PATIENTS CAN'T AFFORD THEM OR GO BANKRUPT IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THEIR MEDICATION. WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT HIGH WE SPECIALIZE DRUGS HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INSULIN AND ANTIBIOTICS DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES. EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA CAPS COPAYS AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER PRESCRIPTION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH CAN ADD UP PRETTY QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TAKING MULTIPLE MEDICATIONS. THE PRACTICE OF PAY FOR DELAY IS ALREADY ILLEGAL UNDER ANTI COMPETITION LAW BUT UNDER EXISTING LAW IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE. WHAT AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR DOES IS TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF AND LEVELS THE PLAYING? PLAYING FIELD SO THAT DRUG MANUFACTURERS NEED TO PROVE WHY THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE. BOTH BRAND NAME AND GENERIC COMPANIES HAVE BAKES THIS PRACTICE INTO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. A TWO THOUSAND AND TEN FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION REPORT FOUND THAT PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS COST CONSUMERS THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE FTC LOOKED AT NINE HUNDRED PATENTS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND FOUND THAT A HUNDRED FIFTY OF THEM WERE POTENTIALLY PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE DATA THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WAS SPENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT IS CLEAR THE PAY FOR TôI AGREEMENTS ARE ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF INCREASING DRUG COSTS. AND THIS PRACTICE IS NOT SOME RELIC OF THE PAST PAY FOR DELAY GRUMMAN'S ARE STILL HAPPENING JUSTIN MAY A LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST GILLY AD FOR ENGAGING IN THIS PRACTICE FOR HIV MEDICATIONS. WHEN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CONSPIRED TO KEEP DRUGS OFF THE MARKET TO INFLATE PRICES CONSUMERS ARE FORCED TO PAY EITHER OUT OF POCKET OR THROUGH THEIR PREMIUMS? FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE KAREN MASTODONS TO SHARE HER PERSONAL STORY OF HIGH CROSSED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. CHAIRMAN PAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME'S CAM MASSILLON. I'M A LIFELONG CALIFORNIAN I'VE LIVED IN SACRAMENTO SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY CURRENTLY I WORK AS A WAITRESS IN TOWN. AND WHEN I'M NOT AT WORK I LOVE SPENDING TIME WITH MY FAMILY TRAVELING AND CROCHET. I ALSO LIVE WITH ASTHMA AND DIABETES. NOT A DAY GOES BY WHEN I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE ON MY LIFE. TO HELP MANAGEMENT DIABETES MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED A DRUG CALLED BY DEAR AND BE SIZE. LAST WEEK MY PHARMACIST HERE SACRAMENTO TOLD ME. ME MY ONE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD COST EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS. MY INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER IT. THAT'S HIGHER THAN MY RENT. I CAN'T AFFORD IT SO I'M FORCED TO RELY ON SAMPLES FROM MY DOCTOR. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE SAMPLES BUT I KNOW I CAN NOT DEPEND ON THEM FOR OVER. AND I'M TERRIFIED FOR TH DAY WHEN THEY'LL RUN OUT. THERE'S NO GENERIC FOR BY DARIAN AND THE DRUG MANUFACTURER ASTRAZENECA HAS HELD MONOPOLY ON THE DRUG SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I DON'T KNOW IF ASTAZENECA IS BLOCKING THE GENERIC VERSION OF THE DRUG I NEED TO STAY HEALTHY BUT I DO KNOW. THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ASTRAZENECA ENTERED INTO A PATENT SETTLEMENT WITH THE GENERIC MANUFACTURE. TIVO THE SETTLEMENT WAS OVER THE SHORT ACTING VERSION OF MY DRUG CALLED. BY THE END OF THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT DICTATED THAT TIVO COULD NOT MAKE THIS IT'S GENERIC AVAILABLE FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS. HAS ASTRID JANICA ZENICA DONE THE SAME FOR MY DRUGS I DON'T KNOW. BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT DRUG PRICES KEEP GOING UP. AND PAY FOR DELAYED DEALS ARE DRIVING UP COSTS BY HOLDING BACK CHEN ERIC'S FROM THE MARKET. THIS COMMITTEE CAN CHANGE THAT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WOULD AND PAY FOR DELAY AND HELP TO MAKE DRUG PRICES LOWER. FOR THE OTHER CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE DESPERATE FOR RELIEF. SO I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW TO BE TRUE. IS THAT. DRUGS DON'T WORK IF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THEM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL MISTER AS OFFICE. ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY pASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND HIS LEADERSHIP ON PROTECTING HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS FROM THE HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE THERE IS PROUD TO SPONSOR AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WHICH AIMS TO REDUCE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY INCREASING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST COLUSA PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENT. ALTHOUGH THESE AGREEMENTS CURRENTLY CAN BE ANTI COMPETITIVE UNDER CURRENT LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO GO AFTER THE AGREEMENTS ARE COMPLEX AND CURRENT LIES TILTED IN FAVOR OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. THE NAFTA MEANT OF AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL CLEARLY AND EXPRESSLY GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ANOTHER TOOL TO DETER THE PLOT PROLIFERATION OF THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS. AND SUPPORT WROTE MORE ROBUST ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY A LEADER IN FERRETING OUT THESE AGREEMENTS AND SHINING A LIGHT ON THEM THROUGH DOJ'S ANTITRUST.

THANK YOU DOCTOR PANDA MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRETT MICHELIN I'M WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINES A AM REPRESENTS THE GENERIC BIOSIMILAR MANUFACTURERS IN AMERICA. WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE GOAL OF DOCTOR WOULD AND THE THE PROPONENTS OF THIS THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE THE COST OF MEDICINES IS THROUGH. GENERIC DRUGS. pWAYS TO GET -- TO DRUGS TO MARKET QUICKER HE HAS PROVEN TO BE THESE TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS. CALIFORNIA SAVED OVER TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BY THE USE OF GENERIC DRUGS. AIMS CONCERN AT THE WAY THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED IS NOT ONLY GOING TO PREVENT NEW GENERIC DRUGS FROM COMING TO MARKET AND SAVING PATIENTS MONEY. BUT IT COULD ALSO TAKE SOME GENERIC OFF THE MARKET IF THE PROVISIONS OF THOSE PRIOR SETTLEMENTS ARE NOW CALLED INTO QUESTION AND UNDER LEGAL THREAT IN CALIFORNIA. A TYPICAL CASE IT'S THE BRAND MANUFACTURER WHOSE FILING SUIT AGAINST A GENERIC MANUFACTURER WHO'S TRYING TO ATTACK THE PATENT TICKET THAT HAS BEEN TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE BRAND COMPANIES IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR MONOPOLIES. SETTLEMENTS HAVE PROVEN TO SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE RECENT CASE OF EXAMPLE OF THAT IS HIS HUMOR. SO WITH THE WORLD'S BEST SELLING DRUGS WHEN THE TOP GROSSING DRUGS ON THE MARKET SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONE MEDICARE MEDICAID PAID OVER THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STRUCK. PATENTS WOULD DELAY GENERIC COMPETITION UNTIL. TWENTY THIRTY FOUR DUE TO SETTLEMENTS THIS DRUG IS NOW GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN ABOUT SIMILAR FORM IN. TWENTY TWENTY THREE EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ELEVEN FULL YEARS BEFORE PATENT EXPIRATION. THIS DRUG NOW COULD NOT THE POTENTIALLY COULD COULD HAVE A DELAY IN COMING TO MARKET EVEN THOUGH THE AGREEMENTS. HAVE ESTABLISHED IT AT THAT PERIOD. BECAUSE AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR ASSUMES THAT EVERY SETTLEMENT IS. ANTI COMPETITIVE IT'S A PRESUMPTION THAT THE MANUFACTURER MUST COME IN AND DEFEAT IN ORDER. TO HAVE WON THE SETTLEMENTS THAT AGAIN THAT TYPICALLY. THE MAIN PROVISION. IS TO ALLOW GENERIC COME TO MARKET BEFORE PATENT EXPIRATION. THIS TYPE OF LEGAL JEOPARDY IT'S GOING TO PUT. GENERIC COMPANIES IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN AGGRESSIVELY ATTACK. THE BRAND'S PATTON THAT IS THAT EXIST. THE NUMBER OF PATENTS ON ON DRUGS IT HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR A EIGHTY DREADED GENERIC TO BE ABLE TO DEFEAT EVERY SINGLE PATENT IN ORDER TO COME TO MARKET IN FACT IF YOU LOSE ONE CLAIM OF ONE PARTICULAR PATENT. THAT GENERIC IS PRECLUDED AND TELL ALL OF THE PATENTS THAT IT TRIED TO QUESTION HAVE EXPIRED WE'VE SEEN THIS IN THE TAMOXIFEN CASE. PERFECT EXAMPLE ONE COMPANY SETTLED IT WAS ALLOWED TO COME TO MARKET FOR NINE YEARS BEFORE PATENT EXPIRATION. EVERY OTHER COMPANY ARGUE TO FINALITY THEY ALL COST. ONLY ONE GENERIC HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE ABLE TO COME AT THAT TIME ON TAMOXIFEN. THERE IS A GREAT CONCERN OVER THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS DRAFTED AND SOME OF THE PROVISIONS I THANK YOU I KNOW I NEED TO MOVE ON AND WHILE SOME OF THE OTHERS TO TESTIFY. BUT IT JUST OF ONE FINAL POINT THERE WAS A SEA CHANGE IN SOME OF THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN CITED BY THE PROPONENTS THAT OCCURRED PRIOR HìNH TWENTY TEN STUDY AN FTC STUDY. THAT'S DATA THAT IS IS PRE ACTIVISTS DECISIONS SINCE HE ACTIVIST DECISION BY THE US SUPREME COURT. WE ARE DOWN. TO FIVE CASES THAT ARE SETTLEMENT SEVERAL QUESTION AND AND BEEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE MOST RECENT THERE IS ONE SETTLEMENT THAT HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY THE FTC. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING FOR A VOTE IN OPPOSITION TODAY PLEASE. SEVERAL OVER TWO MINUTES BETWEEN THE REST. A SHORT LIST SICK ON BEHALF OF FARM -- PHARMA HAS TAKEN AN OPPOSE AND LESS AND ENDED POSITION ON THE BILL INSTEAD OF GOING OVER BACKGROUND I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER OUR AMENDMENTS QUICKLY SO WE HAVE TIMEFOR THIS. OTHER WITNESS PHARMA HAS TO AMENDMENTS THAT -- MAKE CHANGES TO THE FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATION OF THE SETTLEMENTS THAT MAKE THE FRAMEWORK MORE FAIR AND BALANCED WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE INTENT OF THE BILL. THE FIRST IS TO REMOVE THE EXPANDED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT IS CREATED AS PART OF AB EIGHT TWO FOUR AND THE SECOND IS TO REMOVE SOMETHING CLLED THE LESS RESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST. WHAT THIS DOES IS -- FORCE THE JUDGE WHEN THERE'D WEIGHING THE BENEFITS AND THE CONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. TO FIND THAT EVEN IF AGREEMENT IS PRO COMPETITIVE IF THEY BELIEVE IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PRO COMPETITIVE THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONCLUDE IT WAS ANTI COMPETITIVE. FOR THAT REASON WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT PARTICULAR TEST TO BE STRUCK IN FROM THE BILL ALSO IT IS MORE FAIR AND BALANCED WE'VE -- ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE SPELLING LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR OFFICE THANK YOU. TURN MEMBERS MICHAEL LOAD AND BE UP THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA ARE WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE'VE ASKED FOR TWO VERY SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS. TO ALIGN THE BILL MORE CLOSELY WITH THE CONTROLLING SUPREME COURT CASE ON THIS WHICH IS KNOWN AS CIPRO -- CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ANALYSIS FOR MAKING SENSE OF THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED LEGAL QUESTION BUT WE HAVE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION THAT THERE BE NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. BEYOND THE PROVISIONS OF THE CIPRO LINE OF CASES SECONDLY. WE HAVE ASKED THAT THE STACKING OF PENALTIES BE ADDRESSED WHEN USE WHEN YOU STACK THE STATUTORY PENALTIES ALONG WITH THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW PENALTIES WE BELIEVE THE PENALTIES ARE EXCESSIVE. WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS MIKE MAY BE MORE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. LINE OF QUESTIONING BUT WE HAVE ASKED FOR TWO AMENDMENTS AND UNTIL THEN WERE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF BIO COM WE TO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. THANK YOU. DROUGHT COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU. FACING THE OTHER WITNESSES JUST BEFORE I TAKE QUESTIONS ONE THING ICE BECAUSE THIS IS A FAIRLY COMPLEX BILL I'D SWAT BE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE ON THIS. FIRST OF ALL THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING GENERICS TO COME THE MARKET BEFORE THE END OF THE PATENT THIS IS NOT POST PASS THIS IS BEFORE THE END OF THE PATENT NOW. I UNDERSTAND THE THERE'S A FEDERAL LAW -- HATCH WAXMAN THAT CREATES A MECHANISM AND ALSO CREATE SOME INCENTIVES -- ESSENTIALLY A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS COLUSA TO THE PARADE FOR THE FIRST GENERIC. WHO -- CHALLENGE -- BASICALLY CHALLENGES SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGES THE PATENT AND THAT THE PATENT IS FOUND NOT TO BE -- I GUESS -- SOUND THAT THAT -- THEY THEY WOULD HAVE THE EXCLUSIVITY AND THAT. POTENTIALLY THIS BILL IS WORKING OR WITH THIS MECHANISM TO TRY -- TO TO AFFORD THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND AND AND CHALLENGE THE PAN AND THEN ALSO -- COME TO MARKET BEFORE THE END OF A PATENT NOW THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THE PATENTS ON THE NATURE OF THE PATENTS THAT THE BRAND NAME BUT I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT ABOUT THOSE PAT AND WE SAY. PAY FOR DELAY IS ACTUALLY NOT A DELAY BEYOND THE END OF THE PATENT IT'S ABOUT COME THANK YOU MARK. GEN X. COMING TO MARKET BEFORE THE PATENT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW THE CONTENTION IS IS THAT -- GENERICS ARE BEING DELAYED FROM COMING AS EARLY BECAUSE OF BASICALLY SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE MADE AND THAT -- THAT WHEN THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENTS IS IS THAT. A IF YOU'RE. TENCHI PAYING ARE GIVING SOMETHING OF VALUE AND WE MADE SOME AND THAT IS TO GET THAT SO BUT THE YEAH AND IF YOU BASICALLY THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE GIVING SOMETHING TO YOUR COMPETITOR. THAT IS IN A CONDITION FOR THEM STAY ON THE MARKET THAT'S THE INHERENT ISSUE THAT ALSO COMES UP. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMEONE SAYS I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE THE THE PATENT -- WE SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT INSTEAD OF GOING ALL THE THE COURT LET'S SETTLE -- AND THE ISSUE NOW IS I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING SO THAT YOU -- BASICALLY STALE THE MARKET IS PART OF THE AGREEMENT AND THAT AND TO STAND AS THE SORT OF THE CORE ISSUE WE'RE DEALING WITH. HERE WITH THIS BILL AND HOW THE DIFFERENT INCENTIVES GO BACK AND FORTH AND SO FORTH AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME AS I WAS TALKING TO MEMBERS I THINK THERE'S SOME. MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THOSE PATENT PERIOD THIS IS ABOUT PRE PAT AND PERIOD AND THE STRENGTH OF PATENTS AND THE CHALLENGE CHALLENGES THE PATENT IN A STRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN CREATED IN FEDERAL LAW. TO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE CHALLENGING OF THOSE PATENTS AS A WAY -- TO TO BRING GENERICS TO MARKET BEFORE THE EXPIRATION THE REGIONAL PATENTS AND AGAIN WHEN CAN ARGUE ABOUT. THEY ARE GRANTED BY THE PATENT OFFICE SO THEY HAD TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE PATENT OFFICE BUT SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT. SOME OF THESE PATENTS ARE. YEAH PERHAPS NOT AS SOLID IS. THEY MAY BE USED AS A WAY TO DRIVE AWAY COMPETITION AS WELL BUT THIS AGAIN THOSE ARE PASS RECOGNIZED BY THE PATENT OFFICE. SO -- SO IT WITH THAT. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ICE CENTER MITCHELL AND THEN CENTER STONE OKAY SIR MITCHELL. PARDON ME IF YOU ALREADY ROUTE ADDRESS THIS -- MISTER CHAIR -- BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- THERE IS AN INTEREST -- IN EXCLUDING GLOBAL AGREEMENT FROM THE BILL. AND COULD YOU JUST TELL ME YOUR POSITION ON THAT -- I'M I'M NOT THE TECHNICAL EXPERT ON HIS BUT I DO HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP ME WITH THE ANSWER ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME. TO SAID IF I MAY -- AT THE WITH THE PEN LITIGATION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS -- CONCERNS US PATENTS PATENTS ONLY HAVE AN EFFECT INSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH LOOKING AT SEVERAL OF THESE AGREEMENTS. IS THE PHARMA COMPANIES ARE NOW PAYING ONE ANOTHER BY CARVING UP WORLD MARKETS AND LEADING. ONE COMPANY TAKE THE US MARKET AND LETTING THE OTHERS ENTER. THE REST OF THE WORLD SO IT IS BEOME A VEHICLE BY WHICH CONSIDERATION IS TRANSFERRED TO A GENERIC TO STAY OFF THE US MARKET SO. THAT'S WHY WE'RE VERY -- UNRECEPTIVE TO ANY EXEMPTION FOR GLOBAL SETTLEMENTS. AND THROUGH THE CHAIR IF -- THE OPPONENTS CARE TO RESPOND. NATURALISTIC ON BEHALF OF PHARMA -- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC AMENDMENT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PHARMACY KING BUT JUST -- TO SHARE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION LOOKS AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE AGREEMENTS THAT -- IS REACHED BETWEEN -- BRAND MANUFACTURED IN A GENERIC MANUFACTURE AND EVERY YEAR THEY PUT OUT A REPORT THAT SAYS HOW MANY OF THESE HAD REVERSE PAYMENTS AND THEM. AND THEY FOUND IN THEIR TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT WHICH IS THE MOST RECENT ONE THAT ONLY ONE OF THESE TWO HUNDRED AND SOME AGREEMENTS ACTUALLY HAD A PAYMENT IN THEM -- I'M. EXCUSE ME BUT I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT THE RECORD I HAVE THE FTC THAT'S FINE. PLEASE SEE THE FTC'S TWENTY SIXTY REPORT ACTUALLY REPORTED THIRTY AGREEMENTS OF THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO AGREEMENT SAID RECEIVE WHICH IS A RECORD NUMBER. INVOLVED -- POSSIBLE PAY FOR DELAY ANOTHER SEVENTEEN INCLUDED POTENTIAL PAY FOR DELAY. AND WHEN THEY USE THAT TERM THEY SAID THEY CAN'T TELL FROM LOOKING AT THE FACE OF THE AGREEMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO OPAQUE. WHETHER SOME OF THE PROVISIONS ARE ACTUALLY OPERATING AS DISGUISES FOR THE TRANSFER OF PAYMENTS SO -- UNFORTUNATELY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS ARE NOT A RELIC OF THE PAST THEY ARE CONTINUING TO PROLIFERATE. IN FACT WE HAD A REORD NUMBER OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS REPORTED TO THE FTC IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU DOCTOR. OKAY SIR STONE. I'M SORRY IS MISTERCHAIR -- THAT WAS ONE OF THE STATS THAT IT THE HEAD ALSO BROUGHT ON TWENTY MITCHELL. ONE OF THE THE UPON RESPOND TO THAT OR NOT SURE I OPENED UP FOR OF THE STORY JUST. MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR ON HOW I REFER TO THAT. ONE SETTLEMENT -- NUMBER IN. THE PROPONENTS ARE CORRECT THE FTC DID FIND. THIRTY TWENTY NINE OF THOSE THIRTY INCLUDED SETTLEMENTS INCLUDING THE LITIGATION EXPENSES. THE FTC'S RULED AND EVEN THIS BILL INCLUDES SOME ASPECTS OF LITIGATION EXPENSES ONCE THOSE ASPECTS ARE REMOVED THOSE PROVISIONS ARE REMOVED FROM TWENTY NINE OF THOSE THIRTY CASES THAT LEAVES ONE CASE. THAT'S WHERE. I GOT IT THE REASON I BROUGHT UP THAT NUMBER. OKAY THURSTON THANK YOU I WAS GOING TO A FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR ANSWER SO. YOU KNOW IT AS I LOOK BACK ON MY CAREER AND I'VE SEEN. IN. THIRTY SIX YEARS OF BEING A PHARMACIST I'VE SEEN. TREMENDOUS ADVANCES AND AND AND MEDICAL CARE AND TREMENDOUS ADVANCES AND AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFESAVING DRUGS. AND SO WE WERE TAUGHT IN PHARMACY SCHOOL THE DRUG COMPANY GOES THROUGH ALL THIS RESEARCH INVOLVING THE AT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF PROTECTED STATUS WHERE YOU CAN. YOUR INVESTMENT IN. AND HOPEFULLY LIKE MOST -- DRUG COMPANIES TO REINVEST THAT MONEY TO FIND. ETHICAL F. AGO EFFICACY CURES FOR DISEASES AS AN EXAMPLE ALL USE OF DRUGS OF ALL THE AS AN EXAMPLE WE HAVE A CURE. FOR HEPATITIS C. -- NOT AN INEXPENSIVE DRUG BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE OF NOT HAVING THE DRUG. IT COSTS THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN INSURANCE COMPANIES A HECK OF A LOT MORE MONEY -- IN DOING LIVER TRANSPLANTS IT'S CENTRO SO. IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THROUGH YOUR TESTIMONY. THAT AS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN-STATISTICS SHOW THAT THESE. ALLEGE DEALS ARE ARE NONEXISTENT HOW YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO YOUR TESTIMONY AS WELL AND THAT -- THE TALKS ABOUT -- DEALS THAT OCCUR OCCUR IN THE SHADOWS BUT ALL THESE. DEALS HAVE TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CORRECT. THIS IS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS NOT ONLY IS A TRANSPARENT. BUT THEY HAVE TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE COURTS. SO EVEN GUESS HE FURTHER -- LEGAL REVIEW SO. IS THERE AN INCENTIVE FOR A BRAND NAME COMPANY THAT HAS. SEVENTEEN YEARS OF PATENT TO WORK OUT A DEAL. TO ALLOW A GENERIC TO COME ON EARLIER PRIOR TO THE PATENT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY COULD TAKE A RIGHT TO THE END OF THE SEVENTEEN YEARS I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE BUSINESS THING -- FOR A COMPANY TO DO. AND SO -- MY CONCERN HELLO OVER THE BILL IS THAT. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND THE FTC FINDS THAT? THE PROCESS IS PRO COMPETITIVE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FINDS THAT. ANTI COMPETITIVE [inaudible] THEN. WHAT WE DO IN A STATEMENT LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OR? ANY OF THE PANELISTS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE AND AND AND I CAN ASK HER -- ATTORNEYS HERE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE FTC. DECIDES WHETHER SOMETHING IS PRO COMPETITIVE OR NOT. I'M A PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE IS THAT -- WE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME AS AS SPEAKING FOR THE LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR GETTING INFORMATION -- AND SO WE ARE CHANGING THE ASSUMPTION HERE WERE SAYING THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE ARE ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE THAT THE ART ANTI COMPETITIVE -- WE AT THAT HAS BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION TO REALLY TO REALLY VALUE THAT BUT AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THE FTC DOES NOT DETERMINE WHETHER SOMETHING IS PRO COMPETITIVE -- ON THE BASIS THAT ONE ON THE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK OF THEIR DIFFERENT AND JEREMY HAVE A FURTHER CLARIFICATION IN CASE I DIDN'T SCREW IT UP TO BAT. WELL I JUST WANNA ADAM AND MAKE THE RECORD A LITTLE CLEARER NOT ALL AGREEMENTS GET REPORTED TO THE FTC FOR INSTANCE AGREEMENTS INVOLVING BIOLOGICS. HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED TO THE FTC AN FTCTHE ONLY THING THAT THE FTC GETS IS A WRITTEN AGREEMENT. AND THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT MAY SIMPLY SAY WE GOT NO CONSIDERATION THEY DON'T GET ANY OTHER EVIDENCE SO WHEN THEY DO THEIR REPORT THAT THEY SENT TO CONGRESS THEY ARE SIMPLY SAYING WE LOOKED AT THE FACE OF THE AGREEMENT [inaudible] A IT. EITHER PASS IT IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS AND THEY HAVE THIS NEW BOOK CATEGORY. THAT IS GROWING EVERY SINGLE YEAR THAT IS 70% INCREASE IN THE CATEGORY OF SUSPICIOUS AGREEMENTS BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND AND THEY DON'T MAKE ANY DETERMINATION THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE BEFORE THEM OTHER THAN THE AGREEMENT ITSELF SO THEY NEVER DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S PRO COMPETITIVE. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WITH THE STATE OFTEN WORKS WITH THE FTC WE'RE ONLY GOING TO FOCUS ON THOSE CASES THAT ARE THE MOST EGREGIOUS AND WE TYPICALLY -- HAVE A HAVING NO DISAGREEMENTS WHAT THE FTC I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT SITUATION EVER OCCURRING THESE CASES ARE SO HARD TO BRING. I CAN IMAGINE THAT WE WILL BOTH BE BRINGING THE SAME ACTION WITH DIFFERENT RESULTS OKAY BUT THE POINT IS TO FILL THEM TO MENTION YOU MENTION REPORTING TO CONGRESS WHICH OFF TO REPORT TO THE COURTS. AND TALK ABOUT SUSPICIOUS AGREEMENTS JUST BECAUSE A SUSPICIOUS DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL RIGHT SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE FARM HAVE A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THAT. TOO THANK YOU SENATOR -- SO IT THE F. T. C. CAN TAKE ACTION IF THEY BELIEVE THAT AN AGREEMENT IS ANTI COMPETITIVE AND THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY TAKEN ACTION WHEN THEY BELIEVE CELL. AND THE FRAMEWORK FOR WHICH THEY CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WAS CREATED UNDER FTC VERSES ACTIVIST IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN IS AB EIGHT TO FOUR IS PASSED IN CALIFORNIA IT WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT FRAMEWORK FOR REVIEWING THESE CASES THAN THE F. T. C. WILL HAVE. TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS ANTI COMPETITIVENESS AND THIS IS WHY PHARMA IS ASKING FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL TO MAKE IT THE FRAMEWORK THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD USE. TO BE MORE FAIR AND BALANCED SO THAT WAY IF THEY JUDGE BELIEVE SOMETHING IS -- NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE BUT BECAUSE OF THIS LESS RESTRICTIVE MEANS STATUS BELIEVE LIKE WELL THEY COULD HAVE COME TO MARKET A DAY EARLIER SO I HAVE TO CONCLUDE ITS ANTI COMPETITIVE THIS WOULD ALLOW THE JUDGE TO CONCLUDE NATURALLY THAT IT WAS BROKEN. OKAY JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS AND DIRECTED TO ISSUE -- PHARMACY TO MIND. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE IMS INSTITUTE FOR HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS -- STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT. GENERIC DRUGS BEING INTRODUCE -- WERE SAVING BASICALLY SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE YEARS ON THE AVERAGE PRIOR TO A PATENT EXPIRATION. AND AS I ALSO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT TEVA. PHARMACEUTICALS. ROGER -- COMPANY OUT OF ISRAEL RIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT SUPPLEMENTS REMOVED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF OF MONOPOLY PROTECTION AND PROVIDED A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION. IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS THROUGH EARLY GENERIC ENTRY. SO NO WONDER DO COULD DO YOU AGREE WITH THOSE -- REPORTS AND TWO IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW DO YOU SEE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY AS CONSUMERS COULD. BE PAYING MORE. FOR DRUGS AND WHAT I THINK THE GOOD AUTHORS TRYING TO CHEW THROUGH HIS BILL YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR -- YES I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE IMS REPORT AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER STUDY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OUT OF DUKE THAT LOOKED THAT THESE CHALLENGES FROM GENERIC MANUFACTURERS AND THEY FOUND THAT. THERE IS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THESE CHALLENGES AND DURING THAT SAME PERIOD THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT A BRAND IS ACTUALLY ON THE MARKET HAS DECREASED EARLIER YOU MENTIONED THAT BRAND. MANUFACTURERS GET A PATENT FOR TWENTY YEARS FROM THE TIME THAT THEY PUT IN AN APPLICATION THAT'S NOT BEFORE IT COMES TO MARKET BUT TWENTY YEARS TOTAL DURING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TIME. THEY FOUND THAT BECAUSE OF THESE CHALLENGES THE AVERAGE TIME TO THE BRAND ACTUALLY HAS ON THE MARKET HAS DECREASED WHILE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THESE CHALLENGES. AND SO CHANGING THE FRAMEWORK THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR -- DISCOURAGE THE SETTLEMENTS IS GOING TO LEAD TO LAST GENERICS GETTING ON TO THE MARKET SOONER OKAY AND THEN -- LASTLY -- IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT THAT THAT'S A CONCERN FOR FOR ME AS WELL I HOPE THE AUTHOR IS GOING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT -- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- THIS WOULD ALLOW ANYONE RIGHT TO BASICALLY FILE -- LITIGATION. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LEASE IN GETTING GENERICS ON THE MARKET I THINK -- THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN THE REVERSE EFFECT OF THROUGH THE TREMENDOUS TOWARD -- INVESTMENT IN GOING THROUGH THE COURTS WITH MULTIPLE. PLAINTIFFS THAT WILL EVER SEE IT TODAY OR GET ON THE MARKET. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT CORRECT BECAUSE THIS BILL WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN EXPANDED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL AND WE BELIEVE BECAUSE THERE IS THE PRESUMPTION THAT THESE -- AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE BEFORE ANY OTHER FACTS ARE PRESENTED THAT WE COULD SEE AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION AND IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND I'D LOVE TO HAVE THE PERSON FROM SEJAK EXPERTISE. SO I'M AN EXPERT AT KNOWING WHAT I'M NOT AN EXPERT AT AS I UNDERSTAND THIS VERY COMPLICATED BODY OF LAW AGAIN LAID OUT NICELY IN THE ANALYSIS YOU OF THIS. CAUSE OF ACTION WITH THE BURDEN SHIFTING TO THE DRUG MANUFACTURER. UNDER CIPRO THERE WERE FOUR ISSUES THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD TO ESTABLISH WHICH HAS BEEN REDUCED. TO TWO SO IT'S MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE PERSON TO BRING THE ACTION. AND THEN THE BURDEN SHIFTS TO THE DRUG MANUFACTURER TO SHOW THAT IT'S NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS GOING DOWN TO TWO IS WHY WE ASK FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU HAVE A PRIVATE. THIRD PARTY PLAINTIFF THAT THAT THE STANDARDS BE THE SAME AS ARTICULATED IN THE SERB PRO DECISION. THANK YOU AND I GUESS SO LASTLY FOR THE AUTHOR WAS AS AN AMENDMENT THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING OR ARE NOT CONSIDERED I'M NOT CONSIDERING THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS CREATES A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- UNDER THE MY MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- THAT IT DOES NOT AFFECT EXISTING PRIDE IRAQ RIGHT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION UNDER THE CART RIGHT ACT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF THAT -- WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT BUT IT'S ALREADY THERE IN THE CART RIGHT ACT. AND I'D ALSO I ALSO THE CONTENTION THAT ARE THE CONCERN THAT THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO A PROLIFERATION OF OF OF LEGAL ACTIONS I THINK IS I THINK IS IS IS WRONG. THESE ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE CASES TO BRING TO TRIAL IN MANY CASES IT COULD BE FOUR TO FIVE TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR WITNESSES. LOAN THE EXPERT WITNESSES ALONE TO PUT THESE TOGETHER SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO LEAD TO A YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW. THE CORNER THE GUY ON THE CORNER IS AN ATTORNEY BRINGING THESE BRING THE SUITS OF THE THE MAJORITY SINCE RUSSIA BEING COULD BE BROUGHT. THROUGH THROUGH THROUGH THE STATE OR A AN EMPLOYEE OF A LARGE EMPLOYER MAYBE A UNION TRUST SOMEBODY WHO HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN. AND CAN ACTUALLY FRONT THE THE HUGE COST IS GOING TO TAKE TO LITIGATE A CASE LIKE THIS SO I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO THAT KIND OF PROLIFERATION YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION BUT I KNOW ONE THING. I KNOW THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE DEEP POCKETS AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ATTORNEYS OUT THERE THAT MIGHT BE WILLING TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT TO TRY TO GO AFTER THOSE DEEP POCKETS. AND I'M CONCERNED WE MIGHT SEE SOME FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS SAID -- GET IN THE WAY OF AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY -- YOU KNOW. STOP THE ACTIVITY AND THERE WOULDN'T BE A NEED FOR THIS SO THAT IS THE THAT IS A POINT. THERE WAS A FEDERAL TRADE -- FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION -- PRESENTATION TO CONGRESS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THAT SAID. THE PROCESS ISN'T WORKING VERY WELL THEY ACTUALLY CALLED THE CALLED OUT AND SAID WE NEED LITIGATION TO HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE. NOW CONGRESS HAS FAILED TO ACT. THERE IS A BILL BEFORE CONGRESS NOW -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN IN CONGRESS THESE DAYS. SO. THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CALLED ON CONGRESS TO ACT. WE ARE ACTING IN CALIFORNIA IN YES WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A DIFFERENT STANDARD A STRICTER STANDARD WHICH WE ARE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE RIGHT. TO THINGS DIFFERENTLY -- THE FLOW OF THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL LAW IS IS NOT THE CEILING HERE. WE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY SO I ACTUALLY -- BEFORE MILAN TAXI I DO WANT TO CLARIFY AND IT -- THIS ISSUE SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND -- THAT SEJAK THINK STIRS AND THE EXPANSION OF THE PRIOR ACTION BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO BRING SUIT. I ADMIT ARE LEDGE COUNCIL DISAGREES THEY DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS A CERTAINLY I DON'T THINK ANYONE SAID THERE'S A NEW PIRATE ACTION TO QUESTIONS WHETHER THERE'S AN EXPANDED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. YES THE BILL DOES MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO BRING SUIT -- BUT WE THAT THAT'S NOT VIEWED BY PLEDGE COUNCIL AS AN EXPANSION THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION I WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS SO THERE'S A SAID AMENDMENTS ONE AMENDMENTS. WHO'S SO WE PUT A LITTLE GUARDRAIL BASICALLY SAYS CLEAR FIGHTING ANY PENALTIES AWARDED UNDER THE BILL'S PROVISIONS CAN ONLY BE RECOVERED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND A CREW TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. SOMEONE WHO GOES AND PURSUE THIS LAWSUITANY SORT OF PENALTY ACTUALLY THEY CAN'T GET IT COMES TO THE STATE SO THE COULD BE A THIRD PARTY AND AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO JUDICIARY TO DIG INTO MORE OF THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES BUT AT LEAST ONE WE SOUGHT OUT. ADVICE FROM LEDGE COUNCIL AROUND THE PRIMARY ACTIONS AN ISSUE THAT I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I HAVE COME TO THE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE THAT WAS THE EXPLANATION RECEIVE THE ELSE I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS IT AND I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SEJAK POSITION ABOUT. SAYING THAT WHILE IT IS EASIER I MEAN THAT'S A SOMETIMES THAT'S PURPOSE THE BILL TO MAKE HE'S HERE -- BECAUSE NOTHING BECAUSE THAT THE GOING TO PROPONENTS NOT ENOUGH IS HAPPENING IS I THINK A DAUGHTER JUST MENTIONED AS WELL BUT THAT IN ITSELF. THERE'S NOTHING AT ANY THAT IN ITSELF IF YOU THINK IS AN EXPANSION. THAT THESE DIFFERENT THAN ACTUALLY THERE'S NO OTHER PROVISION A BILL THERE'S NO PROVISION A BILL THAT ACTUALLY IS EXPANDING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND AGAIN WE BANDED AUTHORS IT DOES AGREE TO AN AMENDMENT THAT SAYS. THAT TO CLARIFY THAT THE ANY PENALTIES ACCRUE BACK TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT LEASE WITH THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS COMMITTEE ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. AND CERTAINLY PERHAPS YOU DO SURE WHO'S MORE EXPERTISE MAY GET INTO MORE OF THAT. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING LIKE IN NET -- OTHER COUNTRIES TO AVOID EXPENSE SALUTE EXPENSIVE AND TIMELY SETTLEMENTS I GUESS YOU'D SAY -- LITIGATION DELAYS SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER THE PRODUCTS TO MARKET. A BRANDY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OFTEN ENTER INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS INCLUDE GLOBAL AGREEMENTS AND THERE'S AN EXEMPTION YOU DON'T HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR WHAT WOULD BE GLOBAL SETTLEMENTS. NOT AGREEMENT SORRY SO IS A REASON WHY YOU DIDN'T TAKE ON THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ISSUE WE ACTUALLY WE ANSWER THAT QUESTION WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT AGAIN FOR YOU SORRY I APOLOGIZE ALL HAVE -- CHERYL TO SPEAK TO THAT. SO THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR GLOBAL SETTLEMENTS IS BECAUSE THE LITIGATION THAT'S BEEN SETTLED. UNDER THE HATCH WAXMAN ACT OF THE B. B. C. I. A. RELATES TO US PATENTS. AND US PATENTS ONLY GOVERN COMPETITION IN IN THE US MARKET. SO IF WE ALLOW. THE PARTIES TO CARVE UP WORLD MARKETS WHAT HAPPENS IS THE BRAND. CAN HEY THE GENERIC TO STAY OFF THE US MARKET AND LET THEM COMPETE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN INSTANCES OF THAT. ON IN IN THE INSULIN DRUGS WHERE -- ONE INSULIN MANUFACTURER HAS AGREED TO STAY OFF THE US MARKET BUT IS COMPETING IN ALL THE WORLD MARKET SO WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE. A VEHICLE FOR THE TRANSFER OF CONSIDERATION -- PAYMENT IN RESPONSE [inaudible] EITHER -- YES PEOPLE KEEP A BRIEF BECAUSE WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BEFORE. IT DIES YEAH SURE -- THANK YOU. ALL HAVE TO EXPLORE SO LITTLE IGNORANCE ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BUT I CAN SAY IS THAT THESE DO NOT. HAPPEN IN SECRET THE SUB TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT THEY DON'T OCCUR THAT WAY THEY ARE REPORTED TO THE FTC THE FTC DOES REVIEW THEM AND THE LATEST DATA. SHOWS AND WE DO THIS DISCUSSES EARLIER AGAIN -- TO WAS DOWN TO ONE SETTLEMENT THAT THEY CALLED INTO QUESTION. IN SOME AS FAR AS GLOBAL AND AND AND COMPANIES CUTTING UP THE THE WORLD MARKET -- YOU KNOW AS I CERTAINLY CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT INSULIN WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE NO GENERIC OR BIOSIMILAR INSOLENCE IN THE UNITED STATES YET. WE'RE WORKING VERY VERY HARD. TO BRING THOSE FORWARD -- BUT IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT DRUG AND IN FACT THE FDA'S CHANGE THE PATHWAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT REALLY THE DELAY IN INSULIN PRICES HAVE BEEN OR INSULIN -- GENERIC DRUGS OR BY -- SELLERS COMING TO MARKET. pSOME SORT OF GLOBAL AGREEMENT. THANK YOU. AM I GUESS I HAVE A CONCERN THAT -- IF YOU'RE LEGISLATION IS WRONG I MEAN IF IT'S WRONG AND IT DOESN'T PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH -- GENERIC DRUGS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET AM I THINK YOU NEED A BACKUP PLAN BECAUSE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE IT IT'S GONNA ACTUALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT BRINGING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FROM A GENERIC STANDPOINT AND SORRY I WISH THERE WERE SOME TYPE OF BACKUP PLAN BUT I DO -- I DO AGREE WITH SENATOR STONE AND I THINK THE CHAIR FOR CLARIFYING THE AMENDMENTS ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT THE THE COST OF LITIGATION AND COMING TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AND SO I AM GLAD THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO A THIRD PARTY OR SOMEONE WHO BRINGS THE THE LAWSUIT BUT IT COMES BACK TO THE STATES SO THERE'S NO. YOU KNOW -- ACTION I GUESS THAT THE ATTORNEYS WOULD HAVE. TO YOU KNOW WHEN YOULOOK AT A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT YET 33% PLUS THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATION FEES THAT ARE IN YOUR OWN HOUSE PER SE. THEN THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE BUT AT IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF THAT CAN GO TO FEDERAL COURT HAS WELL WHICH ONCE AGAIN WE WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGE IN ACTUALLY COME UP WITH THE LAW WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN FOR MANY YEARS AS I SAID. EARLIER THE FTC IS CALLED UPON CONGRESS TO TO CHANGE THE LAW AND CONGRESS FAILED TO ACT THAT'S WHY WERE ACTING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE REALITY IS IF SOMEHOW WE WE WE WE OFTEN DO THINGS AND LET IT THAT LEGISLATION THAT. THAT REQUIRE US TO GO BACK AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT -- AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IN THIS CASE IF WE FIND THAT THE THINGS ARE WORKING EXACTLY THE WAY WITH YOU WE WILL GO BACK AND DO THAT AND I HAVE DONE THAT WITH OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION SO. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT FROM BEGINNING I WOULD IMAGINE THERE'S PEOPLE ON THE DíAS WHO HAVE BILLS I THOUGHT WERE PERFECT WE FOUND OUT THAT SOMETHING WASN'T QUITE RIGHT. MAYBE NOT YOU CENTER. BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW THE THE READOUT THE REALITY IS THAT THIS IS -- THIS THIS IS AN ISSUE AND AND WE ARE WE ARE TAKING. AND I AND I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY JUST IN GENERAL WHAT IS WHAT IS FASCINATING ABOUT THIS TO ME IS THAT. THE PREMISE ON WHICH ROBIN IS REALLY VERY SIMPLE -- I THINK THE OPPOSITION IS THAT A VERY GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO MAKE IT MAKE IT REALLY CONFUSING AND THAT'S AND THAT'S DISAPPOINTING. I DON'T I I I HAVE TO DISAGREE ON GETS CONFUSING I JUST THINK THAT YOU MAYBE HAVE ONE BAD APPLE AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO RAINY IN AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY. THAT -- HAS BEEN COMPLIANT WITH THE LAW AND NOT PAY THIS PAID A DELAY OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT I MEAN THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS OF THE SETTLEMENTS HAVE GONE FORTH AREN'T LIKE THAT BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WE'VE SEEN -- THAT SO I'VE BEEN SHOWN SO I THINK THIS ONE OR TWO BAD APPLES THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED HERE DOESN'T REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO TO REGULATED ENTIRE INDUSTRY THAT COULD DELAY CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM THE OR GET FROM THE FROM THE GENERIC SIDE TO COME TO THE MARKET. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE MANUFACTURER WHETHER IT'S GENERIC OR NOT GENERIC THE INVESTOR TREMENDOUS AMOUNTOF MONEY -- AND ALL THE FAILURE IN WHAT THAT COST THEM TO DEVELOP A DRUG THAT THAT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AND SAVE LIVES AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT YOU HAVE TO BILL TO MAKE YOUR MONEY BACK SOMEHOW. AND IF THAT MEANS YOU HAVE A PATENT ON IT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND YOU GET TO CREATE THAT REVENUE JUST FOR YOURSELF. THEN THAT'S A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY -- THAT CREATES -- BUT THE PAYS THE BACK FOR THE INVESTMENT THEY MADE TO BE ABLE TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES -- AND TO HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION STEP IN AND STOP ALL OF THAT FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT I THINK ITS INTERFERENCE FROM GOVERNMENT THAT SHOULDN'T BE. ALLOWED I THINK WHAT DOES AGREE TO DISAGREE I WOULD SAY THAT -- THAT IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PRIMARY PATTON COMPOUND PATTON -- YEAH MAYBE THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE LINE IT WOULD WOULD LET LINE OF THINKING MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE. BUT THIS COULD GIVE AN EXAMPLE -- TRUE BOTTOM -- MADE BY KELLY AT WAS ON THE MARKET IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN I BELIEVE -- WE ARE STILL -- BECAUSE OF TWEAKS AN ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE GONE ALONG THIRTY TWO YEARS LATER THAT IS STILL UNDER PATENT PROTECTION. SO THERE IS A THERE IS THERE HAS BEEN AN AGREEMENT REACHED TO BRING A GENERIC TO MARKET A COUPLE YEARS SOONER. BUT WE'RE WELL BEYOND THE SEVENTEEN YEARS OF PATENT PROTECTION HERE. AND SO I HAVE ASKED I HAVE ASKED THE OPPOSITION IF YOU HAVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT BRING SOMETHING TO MARKET CLOSE -- SOONER. IT WHICH WHICH IS. WHICH IS PART OF THIS BILL. THEN SHOW ME PLEASE SHOW ME THAT IS PRO COMPETITIVE SHOW ME THAT IT'S GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER AND NOT NECESSARILY JUST GOOD. FOR THE MANUFACTURERS. AND SO FAR NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT EVIDENCE TO ME YES MA'AM. MATHIS AND I'M JUST JUST JUST JUST BRINGING IT AT JUST BRINGING IT. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS LATER -- TO THE MARKET A COUPLE YEARS SOONER. IS NOT NECESSARILY PRO PRO COMPETITIVE CONSUMERS. YES MA'AM THANK YOU SENATOR AT AT THE HEART OF THIS IS IF THAT LITIGATION BETWEEN THE GENERIC AND THE BRAND WENT ALL THE WAY TO COURT. WHAT WOULD THE COURT DECIDE WITH THE COURT DECIDE THAT THE PATENT WAS VALID IN THERE FOR THE GENERIC HAD TO STAY OFF THE MARKET OR NOT? AND IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES WHEN THESE GO ALL THE WAY TO COURT BRAND MANUFACTURERS WHEN. AND SO THE GENERIC IS NOT ABLE TO COME TO MARKET INTEL THAT PATENT EXPIRES THE SETTLEMENTS -- WHILE THE GENERIC TO COME TO MARKET SOONER. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING TOO THANK YOU AND THE OTHER IN. SORRY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMITTEE A CENTERS ON OF A RECALL OF SO I I HEARD A A FACT THAT -- THE PAD PROTECTION AND UP FOR A DRUG IT'S MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES IS COVERED BY PATENTS AND JUST THE UNITED STATES. AND THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING -- WHEN YOU HAVE -- A DRUG LIKE SAVOLDI -- MADE IN THE UNITED STATES WHAT IS COVERED IN A PATENTED MEAN THAT -- FRANCE COULD -- JUST COPY THE DRUG A COLOR DIFFERENT NAME ANDAND I'M MARKET AND MY AND MY CORRECT IN THAT ASSUMPTION. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION. I BELIEVE THAT EACH COUNTRY HAS THEIR OWN APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE DRUGS SO WHEN YOU DO GET SOMETHING APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S JUST FOR THE US MARKET PLACE AND THEN COMPANIES WILL MAKE DECISIONS. VOTER ON APPLICATION OF THE COUNTRIES OF SERVICE CERTAINLY A GLOBAL DRUG COMPANY THEY'RE GOING TO PROTECT. THEIR INTERESTS BY HAVING THIS PATENT PROTECTION WHICH BRINGS BACK AGAIN I KNOW IT'S NOTSHERMAN ABOUT THESE GLOBAL SETTLEMENTS -- THESE DO AFFECT GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE GLOBAL PATENTS -- AND I DON'T SEE THE EFFICACY -- OF OF EXCLUDING THEM -- ALSO -- IT WAS IT. NEWS TO ME THAT -- WHEN YOU HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT THE BENEFICIARY THE AWARD COULD BE SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE PLAINTIFF? SO MY QUESTION COMING FROM A PHARMACIST AND NOT AN ATTORNEY AND IS A PROBABLY MORE FOR YOU DID YOU DID YOU DID YOU SHERRY BUT WHAT IF YOU FILE THE CASE IN FEDERAL COURT AS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. DOES THE STATE LAW. IF THIS COMES INTO LAW COME INTO EFFECT WHERE THE STATE BECOMES A BENEFICIARY OF ANY AWARD. OR IF IT'S FILED IN A FEDERAL COURT DOES THE PLAINTIFF IN THE PLATE IS ATTORNEY AT A PERCENTAGE OF COURSE OF THAT AWARD. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER BUT I CAN LOOK INTO IT FOR YOU AND GET BACK TO YOU. DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR I'M NOT SURE. MISTER CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR MICHAELA FOR SEE JACK BUDGET AND NO THEY'RE TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE HAD AT THE FIRST ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A STATE LAW I DON'T KNOW OKAY TAKE THIS A FEDERAL COURT I MEAN THE TO TO ADDRESS US OURSELVES QUESTION RIGHT YOU COULD BE IN FEDERAL COURT IF YOU PLAYED BOTH A FEDERAL ANTITRUST CASE. AS WELL AS THE STATE AND I TRUST CASE. OF THIS LAW WOULD GOVERN THE NINETY JUDICATA SAN. OF THE STATE CASE AND FEDERAL LAW WOULD GOVERN THE JUDICATA AND AT THE FEDERAL CASE SO UNDER THE FROM THE STATE -- LAW IT THIS FOR WORK WERE TO BECOME LAW -- ANY PLAINTIFF TO GET RECEIVED AN AWARD THE STATE WOULD BE THE CUSTODIAN OF THAT AWARD CORRECT. WELL UNDER THIS LAW THE PENALTY ONLY A CRUISE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO A PRIVATE PLAN F. COULD NOT CLAIM ANY PENALTIES UNDER ABA TWENTY WHY DO WE HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IF IT'S ETERNAL GENERAL IT'S BASICALLY THE BENEFICIARY OF ANY AWARDS. WHAT THE WE DO NOT CHANGE THE IT WE DO NOT CREATE A NEW PRIVATE CONSERVE ACTION? ASSEMBLY SO YOUR YOUR YOUR POSITION IS THERE IS NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL. NO THEY THERE IS THERE IS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT THAT'S THE SAME AS THE EXISTING LAW UNDER THE CART RIGHT AT OKAY SO THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AS SAME AS THEY WOULD UNDER THE CART RIGHTACT -- WHICH THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IN OTHER ANTI TRUST CASES AGAINST PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S A PENALTY THAT ONLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN GO AFTER AND SEEK SO A PRIVATE PLAINTIFF CANNOT SEEK AS A MEANS OF RELIEF THAT PENALTY OKAY. I KNOW DRUGS I DON'T KNOW. EXCEPT THAT MISTER CHAIR. AGAIN I THINK THIS NEEDS FURTHER -- IS GOING TO JIM MASTICATION -- WE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT PENALTY VERSUS DAMAGES YOU CAN ALSO GET A CLAIM UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT HAS TO GO TO THE STATE SO WE MAY BE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF RELIEF. CAN I JUST ADDRESS AT ONE POINT -- WE'VE EXPLICITLY SET IN THE BILL THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN ONLY RECOVER PENALTIES ONCE SO -- WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T WE COULD EITHER GET THE PENALTIES AS THEY ARE IN THE BILL OR UNDER YOU SEE OUT BUT WE COULDN'T DO TWICE ME SPECIFICALLY TO THAT. RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO I'D THAT AND THIS IS HEALTH COMMITTEE -- OTHER I REALIZE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THIS BILL PERHAPS WILL LEAVE THE LEGAL DISCUSSION FOR JUDICIARY AMENDMENTS THAT WE CLARIFY THAT YES UNDER THE CAR RIGHT ACT. THAT'S WE EAT OUT. BUT COUNSEL STATED THERE'S NO -- EXPANSION OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE HEAR WHAT SEE JACK SAID THAT THEIR VIEWS THAT YOUR VIEW -- TINK OF REPRESENT CORRECTLY FROM YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT. YOUR EXPENSES BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO CARRY THE SUIT BUT NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING ELSE OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED. WAS THERE SOMETHING YOU WITH WELL I AGAIN AT THAT'S TO KEEP A REALLY BRIEF YEAH. JUST ROLLED JERRY JUST VERY BRIEFLY THEN. I STARTED MY TESTIMONY WITH WE AGREED WITH. PURPOSES AND LIMITING PAY FOR DELAYED THIRD LARGE AN UNJUSTIFIED PAYMENTS THIS BILL'S GOING WAY BEYOND THAT THESE ARE CONTENTIOUS FIGHTS BETWEEN. THE GENERIC MANUFACTURE AND THE BRAND MANUFACTURER WE'RE CHALLENGING THEM THEY'RE SUING US IN COURT OUR GOAL FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT SHOULD THAT MANUFACTURES ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS MAKE MONEY BY SELLING DRUGS. GRANTED WE ONLY MAKE 20% OF THE TOTAL DRUG REVENUE. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE 90% OF THE MARKET. WE WANT TO SELL DRUGS WE ARE NOT IN THIS JUST TO GET A SUPPLEMENT TO GO HOME. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO -- SEEN NO OTHER QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL -- DECEMBER WOULD -- IS A FELLOW HEALTH CREATURE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR OFFERS OF IMPROVEMENTS TO MY BILLS THANK YOU -- AND I HAVE YOUR DOCTOR CAN THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THE MOVE THAT OFF THE TABLE NOW. HOWEVER I DO UNDERSTAND CENTER MITCHELL'S BILLS ALWAYS PERFECT ON THE SECTION SO I I I WAS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT. OKAY -- SO FIRST WHAT I WANT THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF I AND MY THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS -- WE'VE OFFERED -- SAID THE VERY MENTION THE ONE TO JUST CLARIFY ON THE PENALTY IN THE PRAYER OF ACTION WE ALSO. RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANT TO TRY SOME CLARITY. ABOUT SOME PROVISIONS -- THAT -- BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL BILL THAT SAY IF YOU OFFER ANYTHING OF VALUE THAT THINGS THAT. IN OUR MIND -- THAT -- I'M NOT DOING A ROYAL WE I'M DIANE. COLLECTED BY STAFF THAT -- SO WE HAVE SOMETHING SO FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING A GENERIC TO COME THE MARKET EARLIER IS OF SOMETHING OF VALUE TO THE GENERIC BUT THAT IS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO THAT SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED AGAINST -- THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT THEY OFFERED THAT IN A SETTLEMENT RATE THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. RIGHT -- BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME LITIGATION -- RELEASED BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE THAT THE GENERIC HAD TO PUT UP TO THE NATIONALLY PURSUE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED -- THE IDEA THAT IT'S A DEAD OR FOR GIVING AND YET -- COSTS THAT WERE SO SO WE PUT THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS -- SO WE WANT TO CREATE SOME CLARIFICATION AS TO THINGS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A VALUABLE BUT REALLY ARE IN LINE WITH I THINK THE GOAL OF THE POLICY WHICH IS TO TRY. TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR JACK TO COME TO MARKET -- OF EARLIER -- AS INCENTIVIZE BITE THE FEDERAL HATCH WAXMAN ACT SO -- SO APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS -- AND WHY NO IT DOESN'T SATISFY ALL OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION I LEAST I THINK THAT -- WE DO ALSO WHILE WILL AND APPRECIATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- IS INTERESTED AND AND ACTUALLY STILL AND RECOGNIZE THE CONSTRUCT IS YOU KNOW IT IS A CHALLENGING I HAVE TO SAY YOU KNOW -- TO BUT THAT THE CONSTRUCT IS. TO ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BETTER BE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION LOOK INTO SETTLEMENTS THAT MAY BE -- THAT THAT WOULD BE ONES THAT WOULD RAISE COSTS. FOR FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PLAN COMES PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS THAT MAY. NOT BE NECESSARY IN THE BEST INTERESTS -- THAT WOULD BE I GUESS THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC AS WELL -- THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD THEN BE BORNE BY THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO -- WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW THIS IS AND HOW THE TECHNICAL I KNOW IT'S GOING TO JUDICIARY SO THERE SO MAYBE SOME UP FEEL FOR OUT PLEASE CLARIFY THIS -- BUT CERTAINLY -- I WELL I THINK YOU AND I'M CERTAINLY OF THE SUPPORTING THE BILL -- THANKS TO THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES -- I WOULD I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE JUST NOTE THAT THIS IS THE THE PREMISE WHICH WHICH OPERATING IS IS FAIRLY SIMPLE -- THE EXECUTION IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED ISSUE AS YOU WELL KNOW -- I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS FOR THE PROCESS WE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS -- WE'VE MET WITH LOTS OF COMPANIES -- AND TO AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION ANYBODY WHO BRINGS US. A SUGGESTION THAT ACTUALLY IS IS IS GERMANE TO THE PURSUIT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE ARE HAPPY TO DO IF WE ARE. AND WE ARE POTENTIALLY CREATING AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WERE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT AND AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK. OKAY THANK YOU THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SERRA LEYVA. THE MOTION IS TO PASS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY -- SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HI AN ICE STONE STONE NO GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I GROWTH. GROWTH KNOW HER TADO. HER TOTAL AYE LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE [inaudible] SIX TWO OKAY THE BILL AS SIX TWO AND SO WHAT I THINK GIVEN THE VETS GET UP THE WHOLE THE ROLE FOR OPEN -- FOR CAPS MEMBERS I SHOULD SAID THIS EARLIER I'D DIE AND HER STAGE TEST MAY YOU'RE TAKING YOU'LL BE ACTUALLY TAKING UP AMENDMENTS THEMSELVES AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIMILAR WORDS ALL RIGHT. THAT'S I KNOW I KNOW YES. BELIEVE ME I KNOW [inaudible] OKAY. SO THE NEXT TO THE BILL -- IS ITEM NUMBER BY SHE OF TWO MORE HERE -- SO YOU DO DO I TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER -- TWO IF I ORDER NEXT YES OKAY SO LET'S MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER. TWO EIGHTY TO NINETY YES. I AFTERNOON WITH AGAIN. DOCTORS HEARING MEMBERS. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS NOT A NEW. ONE AB TWO NINETY IS VERY SIMILAR TO SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX OF LAST YEAR -- CARRIED BY MICHAEL WATER IN YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR LEYVA. SENATOR LEYVA IS MADE BILL MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK -- BUT WAS VETOED. IN MY BILL I'VE INCLUDED LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE VERY CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN [inaudible] ADDITIONALLY. MY BUT MY BY OFFICE THE SPONSORS AND THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS THE CHAIRS CONCERNS AND THAT OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REGARDING RATE SETTING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. I'VE AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT PROVIDE ARBITRATION AS AN OPTION TO THE DEFAULT MEDICARE RATES SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROVIDERS TO MAKE A CASE. FOR AN ALTERNATIVE HIGHER RATE. I BELIEVE THIS PROCESS WITH RIDE AN ALTERNATE TO MARKET CONTROLLED BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT DISTORTS THE REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTING PROCESS WHILE OFFERING PROVIDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CASE FOR WHY THE RATES SHOULD BE HIGHER. I WILL ALSO BE TAKING AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN ADDRESSED BY THE OPPOSITION THAT ANY COST SAVINGS OBTAIN IN THE BILL WILL JUST ADD TO CAN INSURANCE COMPANY PROFITS THEY WON'T AS AB AFTER WE GET DONE I HOPE. THE BILL THE FINES AND REAP AND PLACES REQUIREMENTS ON FINANCIALLY INTERESTED PROVIDERS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY MAKE PREMIUM PAYMENTS FOR CONSUMERS -- INSURANCE WITH THE OBJECTIVE AND OF ENHANCING PROFITS. HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS ARE READY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY PEOPLE AND GIMMICKS BY PROVIDERS ARE USED TO ENSURE THAT REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THEY SHOULD BE. I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO INTERVENE. THE BILL WILL PREVENT PROVIDERS FROM GAMING THE SYSTEM AS A MECHANISM TO ARTIFICIALLY GENERATE THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE MEDICARE RATE PROVIDING THE SAME EXACT CARE THEY PROVIDE TO EVERYONE ELSE. WHY YOU HAVE ALREADY PROBABLY ALREADY HEARD ARGUMENTS AND EVEN ADD TO SCARE PATIENTS ABOUT THE SYSTEM? THAT HOW THE SYSTEM OF CARE WILL COLLAPSE IF THIS BILL PASSES OR HOW TERRIBLE FOUNDATIONS NEED TO SEE SUCH -- PROVIDING ASSISTANCE IN CALIFORNIA I REMAIN UNCONVINCED THAT THESE THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PATIENTS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS PROGRAM WILL FUNDAMENTALLY DISRUPT THE CARE THEY RECEIVE. AS FOR TERRIBLE SYSTEMS WITHDRAWING FROM THE CALIFORNIA MARKET THERE'S CERTAINLY A DIFFERENCE OF OF OF OF OPINION IN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY ON THAT FACT. MY HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FOUNDATION A REVISIT SIR LEGAL OPINION IN LIGHT OF TO LEGAL OPINIONS I EVER RECEIVED ONE FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. AND THE OTHER FROM OUTSIDE CORPORATE COUNSEL THE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT AB TWO NINETY WILL IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. THE GAMINGOF THE SYSTEM IS HARMFUL IN SEVERAL WAYS BUT A PRIMARY CONCERN IS HOW IT DRIVES UP THE COST FOR EVERYONE -- BY SHIFTING RISK TO A FRAGILE AND COSTLY INDIVIDUAL MARKET. AB TWO NINETY PREVENT PROTECTS LEGITIMATE THIRD PARTY PAYMENT MECHANISMS REMOVES THE INCENTIVES PROMOTE FOR PROVIDERS TO GAME THE SYSTEM. AND ESTABLISHES SAFEGUARDS A WHOLE PATIENTS WHO MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY BEEN CAUGHT UP IN ONE OF THESE PAYMENT SCHEMES HARMLESS. THE BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE ANY ENTITY FROM CONTRIBUTING TO A TERRIBLE ORGANIZATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING A PATIENT. TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE COVERAGE IT ONLY PREVENTS THAT ENTITY FROM INCREASING THEIR PROFITS BY MAKING THESE CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH MAKING THESE. WITH THESE ET WITH THESE ENTITIES CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS MAY BE THE REAL INDICATION ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT PATIENTS OR PROFITS. HERE SUPPORT TODAY LARA FEE A OWES -- FORMER DIVVIED EMPLOYEE. SERRA FLOCKS OF CALIFORNIA LABOR FED AND IF THE IF TIME ALLOWS STEPHANIE WALKEN'S DISSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. SIX MINUTES WE UNDERSTAND. EXACTLY SO YOU GUYS FIGURED OUT ON SIX MINUTES UP IT'S UP. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAURA FEE IDEALS. I WORK FOR DE VITA FOR ALMOST TWELVE YEARS AS BOTH AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT AND AS AN INSURANCE SPECIALIST. OVER THE PAST YEARS I WATCHED A VIDA INCREASINGLY PUSH TO HAVE MORE COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS AND THEIR CLINICS. FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD A FEW YEARS AGO. I WAS ASSIGNED TO A NEW TEAM THAT WAS INSTRUCTED TO PERSUADE. DIALYSIS PATIENTS TO APPLY FOR INDIVIDUAL MARKET HEALTH PLANS FOR WHICH THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WOULD PAY THE PREMIUMS. I WAS GIVEN A LIST OF PATIENTS AND TOLD TO APPROACH THEM. AT THE CLINIC. AND PERSUADE THEM. IF THE VETO WAS TRULY ACTING IN THESE PATIENTS BEST INTEREST I WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD TO SHARE BOTH THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND DOWNSIDES OF SIGNING UP. FOR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HOWEVER I WAS ONLY TRAINED TO SHARE. POTENTIAL BENEFITS. I WAS NOT TOLD TO WARN PATIENTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE HIGHER CO PAYS OR DEDUCTIBLES I WAS NOT TOLD TO WARN PATIENTS AT THE MAIN NET MAY HAVE TO CHANGE DOCTORS. I WAS NOT EVEN TOLD TO WARN PATIENTS BUT THEY NEEDED TO CHECK WITH THEIR TRANSPLANT FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THEIR NEW COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WOULDN'T IMPACT THEIR SPOT ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST. ONCE I CONVINCED THE PATIENT TO SIGN UP FOR THE COMMERCIAL PLANS I GAVE THEIR NAME TO AN INSURANCE COUNSELOR WHO HELP THE PATIENT CHOOSE. THEIR INSURANCE PLAN AND APPLYING TO HAVE THE A. K. F. COVER THE PREMIUMS. THEN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I STARTED AT THE VITA PASADENA FOOTHILLS. I WAS TOLD THAT NEW PATIENTS WHO STILL HAD COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. HAD TO MEET WITH THE INSURANCE COUNSELOR INSTEAD OF ME HELPING TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE OPTION OF MEDICARE. THE INSURANCE COUNSELORS FOCUS WAS GETTING THESE PATIENTS ON COBRA. WITH THE A. K. A. PAYING THE PREMIUMS. INSTEAD OF EDUCATING PATIENTS ABOUT ALL THERE ARE OPTIONS. IT WAS CLEAR. THAT THE POINT WAS DEFEATED WOULD GET HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FROM COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS GOING ON TO COBRA. I SUPPORT AB TWO NINETY BECAUSE IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE VITA DOESN'T HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO DO WHAT THEY HAD ME DO. AND THAT WAS PRESSURE PATIENTS TO SIGN UP FOR COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE THAT MAY END UP COSTING THEM MORE. AND JEOPARDIZING THEIR CONTINUITY OF CARE. I THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB. TWO NINETY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SIR FLOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND WE ARE AND HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. TWO NINETY THE REASON WE SUPPORT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN DIALYSIS CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE EXPLOITING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO THEY CAN KEEP PATIENTS ON COMMERCIAL COVERAGE AND CHARGE INFLATED PRICES. AND WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THAT WHY DO WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE IMPACT IS THAT IT IS DRIVING UP PREMIUMS IN AN ALREADY EXPENSIVE MARKET THE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FOUNDATION OFFERS PREMIUM SUPPORT TO ALMOST. FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT HAVE EMPLOYER OR COBRA COVERAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT MEANS THAT IT IS EMPLOYERS IT IS WORKERS IT IS PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PAYING THESE HIGHER PREMIUMS BECAUSE DIALYSIS IS SO EXPENSIVE. AND THESE CLINICS ESPECIALLY WANT THE ONES WITH DOMINANT MARKET POWER ARE ABLE TO CHARGE THREE TO FOUR TIMES EVEN UP TO TEN TIMES AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WHAT THE MEDICARE RATE. WOULD BE FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE SOME WHO MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE AL AS WELL. SO WE ARE PAYING THOSE HIGHER PRICES FOR THOSE INFLATED RATES IN EVERY DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S AN IMPACT ON THE PATIENTS IT'S PEOPLE THING -- A COMMERCIAL COVERAGE IT MUST BE BETTER IT'S GREAT YOU WANT COMMERCIAL COVERAGE. WITH COMMERCIAL COVERAGE THERE COULD BE A SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE THERE'S COPAYS THERE'S COINSURANCE FOR THE OTHER ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE WHEN YOU'RE ON DIALYSIS. AND DOES PATIENTS ARE ON THE HOOK FOR THAT WE HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS WE HAVE TERMS LIKE FINANCIAL TOXICITY. IN THE THE MEDICAL SPEAR AND PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING IN STILL GOING INTO MEDICAL DEBT ON COMMERCIAL COVERAGE. SO WE THINK AB TWO NINETY IS A SENSIBLE BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING PATIENTS AND ENDING. BASICALLY A SCAM THAT IS EXPLOITING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IS REALLY ONLY BEEN HERE GOING ON FOR FIVE YEARS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB.

KEEPING THEM ADDICTED IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN AFTER THE NINETY DAY TREATMENT PLAN WHAT THEY DO IS THEY CUT THEM OFF OF ASSISTANCE THEY END UP HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA.

MR ERM MEMBERS JERRY HEX REPRESENTING TODAY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. IN OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE OPPOSE THIS BILL BASED ON THE RATE SETTING COMPONENT THAT HAS BEEN -- IN THIS BILL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT MADE TO ADDRESS THAT PORTION OF THE BILL -- WE DO REMAIN IN OPPOSITION AND UNFORTUNATELY ACTUALLY BELIEVE THESE AMENDMENTS MAKE THE BILL WORSE. SO IT SEEMS THAT THEY AMENDMENTS WERE MODELED AFTER AB. SEVENTY TWO WHICH WAS A BILL THAT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH CMA IN AN ATTEMPT -- TO FIX A SITUATION IN WHICH THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT ON RATES. FOR PATIENTS THAT WE'RE OUT OF NETWORK SO YOU HAVE A PATIENT THAT BECAUSE THE DOCTOR OUT OF NETWORK. THE SENATE BILL FOR A SERVICE AT A RATE THAT THE HEALTH PLAN DID NOT AGREE TO THE HEALTH PLAN PAYS THE PAYMENTS AT A RATE THAT THE PROVIDER DIDN'T AGREE TO AND THE PATIENT IS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE -- THE SOLUTION FOR THAT PROCESS WAS TO HAVE AN INTERIM PAYMENT OF A 125% OF MEDICARE. THAT WAS NEGOTIATED ON IN AGREEMENT WITH ALL PARTIES BECAUSE THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT TO THAT RATE. WHAT IS THAT PROCESS IS BEING PLACE TO SB TWENTY FOUR FOUR SITUATION THAT WE THINK IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT? IN THIS SITUATION THEIR PATIENTS TRYING TO CONTINUE THEIR COMMERCIAL COVERAGE THEY HAVE BEEN PAYING THEIR PREMIUM AT A RATE. THERE IS AN AGREEMENT ALREADY ON THAT PROVIDER RATE BETWEEN THE HEALTH PLAN BETWEEN THE PATIENT THERE'S A CONTRACT IN PLACE AND WHAT THAT RATE IS. BECAUSE THE PATIENT CAN NO LONGER PAY THEIR PREMIUM AND A THIRD PARTY IS PAYING IT. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE HEALTH PLAN TO THEN GET OUT OF THAT CONTRACT. HEY RAY AT A MEDICARE RATE WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS NEGATIVE AND THERE'S NOTHING TO MY KNOWLEDGE IN THE IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT REQUIRE REIMBURSEMENTS -- OF PREMIUMS FOR THAT NEGOTIATED RISK THAT WAS AND PUT IN PLACE FOR ALL OF THE PREMIUMS THERE'S NOTHING AND AMENDMENTS THAT REQUIRE THE PREMIUMS TO GO DOWN IF THERE IS A COST SAVINGS. WHAT WE'RE AWARE OF IS IT DOES REQUIRE THE THE PROVIDER TO TAKE THIS INTO RIGHT AT MEDICARE AND THEN INDIVIDUALLY THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO AN ARBITRATION PROCESS? TO TRYING TO GET THAT RATE UP FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED AN ARTY AGREED ON SO WE BELIEVE -- THE SET TO A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT WE ALSO BELIEVE IT HARMS PATIENTS THAT CAN'T CAN NO LONGER FORM OF FOR THE PREMIUMS AND RELY ON THESE CHARITY -- PROGRAMS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEVINE BURDEN I'M PRESIDENT CEO OF THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND -- A. K. F. AS A SERVE AN ORGANIZATION THAT FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS HAVE BEEN HAS BEEN HELPING PATIENTS FIGHT KIDNEY DISEASE PREVENTION THROUGH DIALYSIS AND TRANSPLANTATION. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR WE PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO DEPEND UPON ARC GRANTS TO HELP PAY THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. FOR THESE PEOPLE ABOUT HALF FOR HELP WITH MEDICARE AND MEDIGAP POLICIES. WE'VE ALWAYS OPERATED THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FROM WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS ETHICAL STANDARDS AND EFFICIENCY FOR THIS WE'VE BEEN REWARDED THE WITH THE HIGHEST RATINGS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT REVIEW CHARITY NAVIGATOR. WE'RE SEVENTEEN YEAR RUNNING RECIPIENT A FOUR STAR CHARITY PLACE ENOUGH AMONG THE TOP TEN CHARITIES IN THE COUNTRY WE DO ALL OF THIS WITH THE STAFF OF EIGHTY PEOPLE. DESPITE OUR GREAT WORKING COMMITMENT TO PATIENTS AYE LAWYERS HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE WILL BE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN IN CALIFORNIA IF AB TWO NINETY IS AN ACTIVE. MY GENERAL COUNSEL IS HERE TODAY. FIRST I KNOW THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEGAL OPINIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN SAFELY CONTINUE OPERATIONS UNDER AB. TWO NINE BUT THE ADVISORY OPINION FOR OUR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND IS LEGALLY BINDING. AND REQUIRES THAT WE ACT IN GOOD FAITH TO COMPLY WITH ITS ARRANGEMENTS. SHOULD WE NOT DO SO WE A. K. YEAH ARE LIABLE TO THE I. G. FOR SANCTIONS. YOUR OWN GENERAL COUNSEL ON PAGE SIX OF ITS LETTER TO CHAIRMAN WOULD CONFIRMS A CALF CONCLUSION BUT AB TWO NINETY WOULD TAKE US OUTSIDE THE PROTECTION OF OUR ADVISORY OPINION. WHY WOULD WE SEE AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS ALWAYS PLAYED BY THE RULES STEP OUT ON A LIMB WHEN OUR BEST JUDGMENT AND THAT OF YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL SAYS THAT AB TWO NINETY TAKES US OUTSIDE? THE PROTECTIONS OF THE I. G.. WHEN THE COUPLE LAW? BUT AN ABLE THE IG OPINION WAS WRITTEN I WAS A PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTEE IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND I CO LEAD AN EFFORT IN THE DEPARTMENT. TO DEVELOP THIS LEGISLATION I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR CHIEF CONCERN WAS PROTECTING AGAINST DISCLOSURE SO THAT PATIENTS COULD MAKE. UNFETTERED CHOICES OF THEIR OWN AS TO THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. NOW A CAMPUS A CAMPUS FORCED TO SHUT DOWN IN CALIFORNIA. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS THE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS IF THEY COULD NOT FIND ANOTHER WAY TO PAY THEIR PREMIUMS. MANY WILL LOSE MEDICARE ALL TOGETHER OR FACE UNLIMITED OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES IF THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR MEDIGAP POLICIES. THOSE WHO DEPEND UPON COBRA MAY LOSE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY. AND THOSE WHO TURN TO MEDI CAL MAY BE FACED WITH AFFORDABLE SPEND DOWN REQUIREMENTS. MANY WILL LOSE INSURANCE ALTOGETHER AND HAVE TO SEEK EMERGENCY DIALYSIS OF HOSPITALS. FINALLY THERE'S SOMETHING VERY DISTURBING TO ME. ABOUT THE FACT THAT FOLKS IN KIDNEY FAILURE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY BLACK AND BROWN. THIS IS NOT TRUE AT THE BEGINNING STAGES OF THE DISEASE WHEN IT AFFECTS ALL GROUPS PROPORTIONATELY. WHY IS THIS THE CASE? IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A BROKEN DOWN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT GIVE PEOPLE THE CARE WHEN THEY NEED. I URGE THE COMMITTEE NOT TO APPROVE. TWO NINETY BECAUSE IT WOULD FURTHER BREAK THE SYSTEM AND NOW I WANT TO TURN TO MISTER RUSSELL HAS UNFORTUNATELY TIME IS UP IF YOU USED UP ALL YOUR TIME SO I'VE ONLY TAKE NAME DOES ORGANIZATION POSITION FROM THE REMAINING WITNESSES.

SO YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THAT BELIES PEOPLE DIFFERENT LEGAL OPINIONS THAT'S FINE I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE WE HAVE AN ACCURATE READING OF WHAT THE LEDGE COUNCIL ACTUALLY SAID. WHICH WE SOUGHT OUT AND SO THIS IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE ACTUAL LETTER DOES OF ROAD FORWARD READING I'M NOT SO THIS NINE EDITORIAL COMMENT ANYWAY. CONCLUSION AND THIS IS A LETTER THAT WAS ACTUALLY DRESSED TO US A MEMBER WOODS FROM LEDGE COUNCIL IN THE STATE'S INCLUSION IT IS QUOTE IT IS OUR OPINION BASED ON THE FACTS AVAILABLE TO US. THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WOULD REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARRANGEMENT APPROVED BY ADVISORY OPINION NINETY SEVEN POINT. ONE ISSUED BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IF ASSEMBLY BILL NUMBER. ENACTED AND THE AMERICAN CAN YOU FUND COMPLIES WITH THE CHANGES ENACTED BY THE BILL. HOWEVER THIS WOULD BE A FACTUAL DETERMINATION MADE BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IT COULD INVOLVE THE CONSIDERATION OF FACTS NOT AVAILABLE TO US UNQUOTE I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT. FOR OUR DISCUSSION THAT THAT'S THE FACTUAL STATEMENT FROM THE THAT'S A STATEMENT FROM THE LEDGE COUNCIL SO WITH THAT YOUR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON -- IN SENATE HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE -- DOOLING ATTORNEY OPINIONS. AND WE AS THE ELECTED OFFICIALS NEED TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION SO WE FEEL ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY GIVE A LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION -- TO OPINE ON ON THAT RULING MIGHT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE OF COURSE LET'S COUNCIL SAYS ONE THING AND I THINK. I'M GONNA PREDICT THAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY SOMETHING PROBABLY TO THE OPPOSITE -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW. MS BURTON YOU YOU RUN A FOUR STAR CHARITY. THAT -- CATERS TO THE NEEDS OF FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT TRIPOLI -- HILL THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT MORE ABILITY. AND DISEASE STATES [inaudible] THAT. WE NEED THE CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY. THREE TO FOUR DAYS A WEEK. A GETTING DIALYSIS TREATMENTS WHICH WE KNOW OR NOT SHE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A COUPLE OF PROVIDERS OUT THERE THAT ARE. LARGE -- THANK HEAVENS THAT THEIR LARGER THERE OUT THERE BECAUSE I REPRESENT A LOT OF RURAL AREAS. AND IT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE. WAS SOME OF THE POPULATION CENTERS THAT I HAVE IN MY DISTRICT THAT OUR ROLE. THAT CAN REALLY. ALLOW YOUR CENTER. MORE COMPETITORS SENATOR TO TO BE PROFITABLE BASED ON THE VOLUME OF PATIENTS THAT ARE THERE SO -- JUST LOOKING OVER. THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR PATIENTS THAT TO CONTRIBUTE. VAST SUMS OF MONEY TO AN CENTER PANS DISTRICT SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE AND SENATOR TADO IS NINETY EIGHT PEOPLE SENATOR GROVE IS EIGHTY FOUR PEOPLE. SENATOR LEYVA YOU WIN THE PRIZE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN CENTER RUBIO SIXTY SIX SENATOR MITCHELL EIGHTY TWO SENATOR. GONZALEZ NINETY SEVEN AND I MISSED MYSELF HERE MISTER STONE NINETY NINE SO THAT'S A TOTAL OF ALMOST. SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE. NOW -- IF I HEARD YOU YOU PEOPLE SAY THAT -- WE WOULD BE 1100% PROTECTED BY A INCREASING THIS BILL -- I MAY LOOK AT IT THROUGH A DIFFERENT LIFE BUT I AM NOT SURE AND I WANT TO TAKE UP A RISK. A FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SCRAMBLING. AND HAVING TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE I LEGAL JUDICIAL. MECHANISMS TO TO GET THEIR TREATMENT SO -- IF YOU COULD PLEASE JUST BRIEFLY IN NOT GETTING INTO A HORRIFIC DETAILS TAMI. RIGHT TO THE POINT WHY YOU FEEL THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. OPINION -- IS IN CONFLICT WITH HIS BILL AND WHAT IS THE POSITION OF A K. F. WILL YOU STAY OR DO WE BE FORCED TO GO. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION AT THE THE ANSWER QUICKLY AS WE WILL GO -- IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF IT'S THAT WE WILL. AND THE REASON THAT THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN WILL GO IF THIS LAW IS PASSED IS BECAUSE THERE IS DIRECT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TEXT OF AB. TWO NINETY AND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED THEREIN. AND THE PROVISIONS OF NINETY SEVEN DASH ONE NINETY SEVEN DASH ONE IS THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ADVISORY OPINION. UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE. AND MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO PLEASE LISTEN TO THE PIECE OF THE MEMO TO MISTER WOOD. THE DOCTOR PAN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO NOT READ TO YOU. BECAUSE WE SUBMIT THAT THE CONTROLLING LEGAL QUESTION HERE TODAY. IS IN FACT THE QUESTION THAT MISTER WOULD ASK OF LEDGE COUNCIL. IN IT JUNE TWENTY EIGHT LETTER TO MISTER WOULD LEAD COUNSEL SAID. DEAR MISTER WOULD YOU HAVE ASKED WHETHER A K. F. WOULD REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE. WITH THAT APPROVED ARRANGEMENT IF ASSEMBLY BILL. TO NINETY IS ENACTED AND THE A. K. F. COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT BILL. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION TO MISTER WOOD IS FOUND PAGE SIX OF THE MEMO. OR LEDGE COUNCIL SAYS AND I QUOTE DIRECTLY FROMLEDGE COUNCIL'S MEMO TO MISTER WOULD. BECAUSE THE DISK BECAUSE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT. CONSIDERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHEN IT ISSUED OPINION NINETY SEVEN DASH. ONE THAT OPINION WOULD NOT INSURE. THAT THE VERSION OF THE PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OPERATED BY THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH AB TWO NINETY WOULD BE IMMUNE FROM -- IG SANCTIONS. PLEASE MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT WHAT LEDGE COUNCIL IS TELLING THE MEMBERS BUT THEY TOLD MISTER WOULD. THERE IS DIRECT CONFLICT BETWEEN AB TWO NINETY AND THE FEDERAL VISOR OPINION UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE. TO RECEIVE A FAVORABLE ADVISORY OPINION FROM THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. MEANS THAT THEY BLESSING ARRANGEMENT EXACTLY AS IT IS REQUESTED FROM. A GROUP LIKE THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND. AB TWO NINETY REQUIRE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IN NINETY SEVEN DASH. ONE IT REQUIRES US TO PUT THE NAMES OF PATIENTS ON A LIST. ALL OF THE FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS A CALIFORNIA RECEIVING ASSISTANCE. BY THE WAY WE DON'T HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE PATIENTS TO DO THIS PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE LIST AND PROVIDE A LIST OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. SO IT CAN TRIGGER THE RATE SETTING PROVISION OF THIS BILL. THAT IS NOT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF WHAT NINETY SEVEN DASH ONE SAYS. TO DO SO WOULD PUT US IN GRAVE DANGER OF LOSING OUR ADVISORY OPINION NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONWIDE. IT IS UNEQUIVOCALLY A WE WILL LEAVE IF THIS BILL IS PASSED WE DO NOT TAKE ADVICE FROM OUR OPPONENTS LEGAL COUNSEL -- AND WEEP AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE LEDGE COUNCIL HAS IN FACT. CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THE ISSUE HERE AND CONCLUDED THE SAME THING THAT A THAT THE AMERICAN CAN YOU FIND CONCLUDED. SINCE THE BEGINNING AND AS A FOLLOW UP SO WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU PULL OUT OF CALIFORNIA WILL WIN. WHAT WITH THE DISPOSITION BE AT LEAST FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE HOW QUICKLY? WHEN THEY BE ABLE TO FIND INSURANCE AND? GET THE SET UP AND WHAT IS THE PROCESS IN TRUTH WE DO NOT KNOW THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY THEIR OWN PREMIUMS WE PAY. OFF FOR FOR PEOPLE WERE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HALF OF THEM ARE HAVING THEIR MEDICARE AND MEDIGAP PREMIUMS PAID. IF THEY CAN'T PAY THOSE THEY LOSE ACCESS TO MEDICARE IF THEY LOSE ACCESS TO MEDIGAP THEY FACE UNLIMITED OUT OF POCKET EXPENDITURES. IF WE'RE HELPING THEM WITH THEIR WITH WITH THEIR COBRA AND THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO TO DO THAT THEY'RE FULL FAMILIES MIGHT LOSE COVERAGE MANY PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND ANY COVERAGE AT ALL. AND WILL END UP IN HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS SOME WILL GO TO MEDI CAL BUT THEY HAVE A SPEND DOWN REQUIREMENT AND MANY MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED AND CANNOT PAY THEY'LL SPEND DOWN. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE -- GRANTED THE TO U. CONTRIBUTOR FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE YOU HAVE AN AVERAGE NUMBER THAT -- THERE THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS A TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IT VARIES QUITE A BIT BECAUSE OF MEDICAID MEDICARE ON THE ONE SIDE WOULD BE ON THE LOW SIDE AND SOME OF THE OTHER INSURANCE WOULD BE ON THE HIGHER SIDE I DON'T HAVE. A BUT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT TO YOU AND THEN IT WAS A MENTION THAT -- THAT THIS -- POTENTIAL BILL AND THE REDISTRIBUTION OF THESE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE WOULD BE THIS DISPARAGINGLY -- LEE AGAINST UP PEOPLE OF COLOR CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT THE TRUTH WITH US TO THAT STATEMENT OR IS A FALSE. YEAH THAT IS AN ABSOLUTELY TRUE STATEMENT AND AS I MENTIONED WHILE AT THE BEGINNING OF KIDNEY DISEASE THE THE DISEASE'S DISPROPORTIONATELY SPREAD AMONG ALL RACES IN GROUPS. OF PEOPLE THE THE NUMBER WHO ACTUALLY GO INTO KIDNEY FAILURE -- IS DISPROPORTIONATE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS AND AMONG LATINOS AND THAT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT GET ACCESS TO CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT BY THE TIME THEY GET THEIR THEIR IN KIDNEY FAILURE. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE QUESTION IF I MIGHT I WANT TO CALL ON MISTER DESMOND JUST REALLY BRIEFLY TO TELL YOU THE PATIENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM. MR DOES MEN OF SORRY TO GET CHANCE TO MEET YOU BEFORE. WHERE THEY HAVE? THE CHANCE MY NAME IS RUSSELL DOES WHEN. AND I AM A DIAL IT. TRY TO KEEP HER BRIEFLY SEPARATELY SO -- MY SITUATION IS SIMILAR TO WHAT. WAS JUST DESCRIBED -- I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR MY HEALTH CARE. OKAY AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND PAYS FOR MY I HAVE A MEDIGAP -- SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICAL INSURANCE THEY PAY THE PREMIUM THAT ON THAT. OKAY I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY IT OTHERWISE -- WHAT HAPPENS WITH ME IS THAT? MY SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY IS MY ONLY INCOME. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO PAY MY LIFE? YOU KNOW NECESSARY THINGS FROM LIFE -- GREAT. FOOD MEDICATION MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND EVERYTHING. THERE IS NOTHING LEFT. YOU KNOW WITHOUT A KEY OF SUPPORT. THERE IS NO REASON FOR ME TO EVEN TRY TO CONTINUE TO LIVE. BECAUSE I CANNOT MAKE MY MY FINANCIALS -- I HAVE RIGHT NOW SO MUCH GOING ON WITH ME IN TERMS OF MY MEDICAL [inaudible] CONDITION. MY FINANCIAL CONDITION ON TOP OF THAT. IN THIS IS OVERWHELMING. OKAY. WOULD YOU SEE IS THAT ANYBODY IN A PATIENT WHO WAS ON DIALYSIS WILL LIKE IN MOTION. A TURBULENT OCEAN [inaudible] ON IN A CABLES PROVIDING ME A LIFE RAFT [inaudible] OKAY. IF IF YOU ALLOW A CARE. TO BE PUSHED ASIDE YOU TAKE WIN MY LIFE. FOR AND THERE'S NO POINT WHERE DO YOU LIVE SIR I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO SO YES I HAVE YOU CLOSE -- TO A DIALYSIS CENTER THIS CALM I ATTEND -- THE DIALYSIS MANZANITA CLINIC IN CARMICHAEL AND YOU GO THREE FOUR TIMES A WEEK AGO THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR FOUR HOURS A TREATMENT. AT THE THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN WERE TO GO AWAY HOW WOULD YOU. PAY FOR YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE WHY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO YOU WOULD QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL OR ANY OTHER ASSISTANCE I I HAVE MEDI CAL BUT THE PROBLEM WITH MEDI CAL IS I HAVE A SURE COST. BUT SURE OF COURSE IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS BEFORE THEY WILL START TO PAY AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. I DON'T HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THERE'D BE NO WAY THAT I COULD MAKE THAT UP SO MY CHOICE TO BE FOOD. LIVE IN A CARDBOARD BOX BECAUSE IT CAN PAY MY RENT. AND THEN NOT PAY FOR MY MEDICATIONS OR SEE MY DOCTOR. THERE WILL BE NOTHING. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND SHARING YOUR STORY THANK YOU. BUT I COULD I TRANSCEND. THEY DRESS THAT CAN ACTUALLY THAT THE CENTER STONE -- BUT I'M SURE SOME OKAY YES. EN ROUTE I ONE THING MISTER DESTINED FOR BEING HERE AS WELL -- I APPRECIATE YOUR STORY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN. THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT WOULD PREVENT A K. F. FROM GIVING YOU YOUR MEDIGAP INSURANCE. WHAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON IS THE PRIVATE INSURANCE PORTION OF THIS? A CAP DOES NOT HAVE TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA. IN THE END NOT SUPPLY THAT INDEED THAT PART OF IT FOR YOU WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED PATIENTS THAT ARE HERE. THAT IS PART OF WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS MISINFORMATION. THIS IS NOT GEARED AT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICARE CURRENTLY WE'RE A K. F. IS PAYING THE SUPPLEMENTAL THAT DOESN'T AFFECT THEM AT ALL. NOT AT ALL SO IT'S A MISS IT IS MISINFORMATION AND I'M AND I'M DISAPPOINTED BY THAT QUITE FRANKLY IF I MAJOR QUE NO CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SORRY LET ME GET CLOSE TO THE MICROPHONE. DOCTOR WOULD ASSEMBLY MEMBER I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PICKING UP THE MANTLE -- WHERE I LEFT OFF AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL IN. I JUST I'M GLAD YOU STATED WHAT YOU STATED ABOUT -- A. K. OF BEING ABLE TO PICK UP THAT -- BENEFIT BECAUSE I KNOW ALSO THAT THE THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THAT FROM HAPPENING. AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS COMES DOWN TO PROFITS -- I NOTICED A VIDA IS NOT AT THE TABLE -- TO TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WHEN I CARRIED THIS BILL LAST YEAR I MET WITH I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS OUR C. E. O. OR ONE OF THEIR EXECUTIVES. WHO WAS BRAGGING ABOUT OPENING FIFTY MORE DEFEATED CLINICS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOT CALIFORNIA BUT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA? YOU DO NOT OPEN. CLINICS YOU DO NOT OPEN ANY BUSINESS IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY AND FIFTY IS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. SO THIS IS ABOUT. KICKBACKS THIS IS ABOUT A SCHEME THIS IS ABOUT CORPORATIONS CORPORATE HIGH HOUSING. PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF PEOPLE AND MAKING THEM THINK THAT THEY WON'T GET COVERAGE. MISTER DESMOND I HAVE FOUGHT MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. I WOULD NEVER CARRY A BILL I WOULD NEVER VOTE FOR SOMETHING THEY WOULD HARM YOU OR ANY OTHER PATIENT YOU DON'T KNOW ME SO YOU DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT. BUT IT IS TRUE. I IF MANY OF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT REMEMBER THERE WAS A PROPOSITION ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. AND ALL THIS PROPOSITION WOULD HAVE DONE WAS A THE PROFITS OF DE VITA AND FOR SENIORS. 215%. THEY SPENT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF PEOPLE AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT PROPOSITION DIDN'T PASS. THIS IS ABOUT PROFITS IT IS NOT ABOUT PEOPLE IT IS NOT ABOUT PATIENT CARE. DOCTOR WOULD I APPLAUD YOU FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS -- I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I HOPE THAT THE MISINFORMATION THAT CONTINUES TO BE PUT OUT THERE IS STOPPED BECAUSE IT'S REALLY UNFAIR TO THE PATIENTS. THANK YOU AND ALL MOVE THE BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE. QUESTION CENTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I'M CURIOUS -- AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ROLE THIS ORGANIZATION PLAY SO -- YOU KNOW AT AND WHO THEY ARE GOVERNED ARE CONTROLLED BY YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS ARE GOVERNED BY KNOCKS KEEN. AND SO AS A NONPROFIT ENTITY -- MISTER WOOD OR THE CHAIR YOU KNOW WHO PROVIDES OVERSIGHT. OVER THIS ENTITY. AUTHOR ANSWER THAT EXCEL -- ALAS MAYBE JOAN CAN HELP I DON'T SEE DON'T KNOW. IF THERE IS ANY [inaudible] SO -- AS WITH ANY NONPROFIT THE OVERSIGHT WOULD BE THE ORGANIZATION'S BOARD. WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF DIALYSIS PROVIDERS -- AND HAS. FAIRLY GOOD CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS. HOWEVER. WHAT REALLY IS THE CASE IS THAT REVENUE COMES INTO CONTRIBUTIONS? FROM THE VITA AND FRESENIUS THESE CONTRIBUTION THE IDENTITY OF THESE CONTRIBUTORS IS MASKED IN PUBLIC DISCLOSURES HOWEVER IT'S BEEN DISCLOSED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES AND DISCLOSED REPEATEDLY. IN SEC FILINGS AND OTHER PUBLIC. FILINGS TO REGULATORS -- ALSO DEFEATED FRESENIUS ARE THE ONLY TWO COMPANIES LARGE ENOUGH TO BE THOSE CONTRIBUTORS. IT WOULD BE A WILDLY DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ANY OTHER DIALYSIS COMPANIES REVENUE BUT IN THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND'S ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED STATE. THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WITH LIVES TURNED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. OF THE REVENUE CAME FROM JUST TO CORPORATE CONTRIBUTORS. CURIOUS TO ME IN TERMS OF IF THEY'RE NONPROFIT AND AND AND HOW THOSE TWO CORPORATIONS COULD EVEN. YOU KNOW CHARACTERIZES DONATIONS IS TAX DEDUCTIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS THE ISSUE HAVING COME FROM NONPROFIT EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT AT A TIPPING ISSUE. YES TWO LARGE OF YOUR BUDGET COMES FROM ONE SOURCE -- THAT WAS ALWAYS AN ISSUE WITH FOUNDATIONS THAT YOU KNOW I FOUNDATION COULDN'T BE INVOLVED INTO BEING IF THE LITTLE LION SHARE OF YOUR ORGANIZATION BUDGET COMES FROM ONE ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE IRS GETS. CURIOUS TO SAY THE LEAST ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE NONPROFIT BUT SEPARATE FROM THEIR NONPROFIT STATUS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ENGAGING IN -- HELP NOT HEALTH CARE DELIVERY BUT IN IN AND FUND DEAN HEALTH CARE SERVICES LIKE AN INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD THERE IS NO OTHER. INSURANCE REGULATOR THAT'S INVOLVED WITH THIS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THE ACTUAL MECHANISM IS NOT THAT THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND PAYS. FOR A PAYS. CLAIMS THEY PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SO THEY WILL PAY THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE SEE THE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BECAUSE IT IS THAT THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WHO WHO'S RISK POOLS. ARE BEING BURDENED BY PATIENTS pPUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. SO PATIENTS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE ON MEDICARE. ARE BEING TOLD. STAY ON COBRA BEING WILL PAY YOUR PREMIUM. AND THAT RAISES A PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE RATES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. THE QUESTION -- THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING WITH US YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- A SHERIFF COST IN MEDI CAL TO THE TO THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IF SOMEONE COULD. PROVIDE ME WITH SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT IF YOU ARE AN MEDI MEDI RECIPIENTS -- A FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR. THERE IS A SPEND DOWN WE HAVE FOR MEDI CAL WILL KICK IN. ACTUALLY -- ACTUALLY LOOKING AT SCOTT VAN YOUR RIGHT NO. HE USED TO WORK FOR THE SENATE IF SOMEONE. PLANE THAT TO ME I WOULD REALLY CHEN YEAH I SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW WHO KNOW LITTLE ABOUT MEDICARE MEDICARE. MISTER CHAIR HOLD ON THE SO IS -- BUT NO ACTUALLY WE SHOULD PERHAPS AS WE HAVE CONSENT WELL. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU TERRY FROM WESTERN CENTER ALL RIGHT. I THINK WE WILL RECOGNIZE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO IS KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THIS AREA I HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN GIVE OUR COMMITTEE STAFFERS TO DO THAT BUT I DON'T SEE CAN REALLY OR SO YES PROGRAM. MANY MEDI CAL PART PROGRAMS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AGED AND DISABLED THEY'RE ON A MEDICALLY NEEDY PROGRAM AND SO IF YOUR INCOME IS OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. YOU PAY THE REMAINDER OF YOUR INCOME AS A SHARE OF COST. PRIOR TO YOUR MEDI CAL ACTUALLY STARTING TO PAY FOR YOUR COVERAGE AND THAT BECOMES YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT THAT WAS MENTIONED YOU KNOW. OFTEN WELL OVER HALF OF SOMEBODY'S INCOME. SO IT'S NOT LIKE REAL INSURANCE IN THAT CASE RIGHT HEY THE SPEND DOWN RIGHT THANK YOU OKAY AND THAT I SEE -- HEALTH COMMITTEE SINCE ON MEDI CAL THE UNITED. THE ENERGY HERE DISCUSSION. SO I I'M FINE OKAY COULD YOU GOT THE ANSWER YOU WANT OKAY AND I THINK I THINK THAT'S A RELIABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION OKAY. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OKAY US ALL RIGHT LOCAL CENTER GROVE AND INSTEAD RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO AND DRINK SOME OF MY QUESTIONS TO MS BURTON YOU'RE THE CEO OF AMERICAN KIDNEY FOUNDATION YES THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN AMERICAN TO DEFEND THAT YES I APOLOGIZE AND AND I WAS READING YOUR BIO. HI CREDENTIALS APPOINTED BY. PRESIDENT CLINTON. THE ORGANIZATION THE RENDON SEEMS VERY -- CREDIBLE OF ALL THE AWARDS THAT SHE RECEIVED AND I'D LIKE TO DIRECT MY QUESTIONS TO MR DOES MEN. AND BASED ON THE OPINION WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WHAT LEAD COUNSEL HAS PROVIDED HERE ARE YOU DO YOU TEND -- TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR BOARD. TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA AND OPERATE AND PAID THESE -- THESE -- PREMIUMS THAT HELP PEOPLE ACQUIRE THIS TREATMENT. OR ARE YOU LEANING TOWARDS THE SEEM TO YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. AND YOUR OPINION OF WHAT LET'S COUNCILS LETTER IS WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS MATTER WITH OUR BOARD. BECAUSE WE WANT PATIENTS TO HAVE AS MUCH NOTICE AS POSSIBLE THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION FOR US. BECAUSE OF THE I. G. OPINION APPROVES A SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE WE DO NOT WANT TO ABANDON PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. AND FOR THIS ADVISORY OPINION WE CANNOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT AND COMPLY WITH. TO NINETY AND OUR BOARD AGREES WITH THAT. SO AND IF YOU. LEAVE CALIFORNIA IS THERE A WAY FOR THESE PATIENTS TO BE BEATEN ARE AWARDED GRANTS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA BUT I DON'T I CAN'T SEE GETTING TREATMENT ELSEWHERE BECAUSE YOU GET THREE TIMES A WEEK RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST NOT VIABLE -- SO I GUESS I ANSWERED MY OWN QUESTION THE OTHER THING IS TAT YOU WERE TRYING TO COMMENT ON THE SPEND DOWN FOR THE MEDICARE ARE MEDICARE YOU'RE TRYING TO COME IN ON THE SPEND DOWN. AND I GUESS I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT FROM EITHER YOU OR MISTER DESMOND LET'S JUST SAY FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE. MR DOES MAN BRINGS AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH JUST FOR EASY MATH. AND ANYTHING OVER SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH HAS TO BE SPENT DOWN TO PAY INTO MEDICARE OR THIS FOR HIM TO GET THE TREATMENT THAT YOU PROVIDE FOR OR THAT YOU PAY FOR TAP PROVIDE SEEM. AND IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IF HE DOES BRING IN SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ANYTHING OVER SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH HAS TO GO TO PAY. FOR THE TREATMENT IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT I THINK THAT THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS PROVIDED IS A GOOD ONE THAT THERE IS I CAN'T TELL YOU IN CALIFORNIA. EXACTLY WHAT THOSE BREAK POINTS ARE BUT HE KNOWS THEM VERY WELL AND THAT THAT IS -- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT ANYTHING OVER THE SIX HUNDRED HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY IN TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF THE SPEND DOWN? MR DES MEN CAN YOU LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE NOW AND WHAT YOU LIVE ON IN THE FOOD YOU EAT IN THE RENT YOU PAY ON SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. ABSOLUTELY NOT. ABSOLUTELY NOT. IS THIS -- TREATMENT THAT YOU GET THEM AND WHERE THE PREMIUMS ARE PAID FOR BY THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FRIEND -- IN A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION FOR YOU YES YES. AS IT IS EVEN WITH THE HELP THAT I RECEIVED FROM AMERICA KIDNEY FUND. I AM I AM I AM ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL [inaudible] YOU KNOW -- YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN ADDITION TO MY HEALTHCARE ISSUES -- I HAVE THE REGULAR COST OF LIVING. YOU KNOW WITH THE RENTS SKYROCKETING TRANSPORTATION COSTS FOOD COSTS MEDICATION COSTS GOING UP CONSTANTLY -- INSURANCES. THERE THERE REALLY IS NO LIFE RAFT FOR ME I'M I'M I'M TRADING WATER THANK YOU SIR. M. MISS BURTON -- IT'S BEEN. WIDELY SAID SEVERAL TIMES THAT TWO PARTICULAR ORGANIZATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FAN. DOES ANYONE FROM FOR SENDING US OR TO BE TO SIT ON YOUR BOARD. NO ONE FROM THE VETO OR FOR CYNTHIA SITS ON OUR BOARD WE HAVE VERY STRICT ALL CONFLICT OF INTEREST REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR BOARD. IS A BOARD OF BOB MAXIMUM TWENTY SIX PEOPLE AND NO ONE ON THE BOARD OR ON OUR STAFF CAN HAVE ANY FINANCIAL INTEREST TO A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DIALYSIS PROVIDER. AND IF IF IF I MIGHT ADD TO THAT. I FEEL THAT I MUST DEFEND THE REPUTATION OF THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUN I AGREE FULLY WE'VE GOT TO GET THE FACTS ON THE TABLE. OF THE THE THE UNIQUENESS OF THE I. G. OPINION AND THE ARRANGEMENT THAT IT DESCRIBES MAKE SURE THAT WE TREAT ALL PROVIDERS THE SAME. OF THE PROVIDERS WHO ACTUALLY REFER PATIENTS TO THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUN 40% OF THEM DO NOT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL. WE MUST PROVIDE GRANTS IN THE ORDER THAT WE RECEIVE THE GRANT APPLICATIONS AND WE MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANY. OUR PATIENTS WHO SEES A PROVIDER ALL WHO DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE AND WE HAVE NEVER DISCONTINUED. ALL THE IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT. TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE PULL OUT OF CALIFORNIA YES WE ARE PULLING OUT OF ALL PROGRAMS BECAUSE AGAIN THAT IS THE WAY THE OPINION IS WRITTEN THAT WE DEAL WITH ALL INSURANCE. AND ALL HEALTH COVERAGE ON AN EQUAL BASIS SO WE CAN'T JUST DEAL WITH ASSISTING PEOPLE FOR MEDICARE BUT IGNORING OTHER COVERAGE THAT'S AVAILABLE. THESE ARE NOT CHOICES THAT WE HAVE THEY ARE REQUIREMENTS. SO AND I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS IS ANYBODY FROM FEES FOR CDS OR PERSON IS OR DE VITA TELL YOU WHO TO GIVE. OF ASSISTANCE TO BETTER THAN ANOTHER PROVISION OF THE I. G. OPINION THAT WE CAREFULLY UP CAREFULLY EMPLOYMENT AND THAT IS THAT OUR DECISIONS ARE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT. OF ANY INFLUENCE FROM ANY OF CONTRIBUTOR TO THE FUN INDEED A CONTRIBUTED TO THE FUN IN THE OPINION SAYS THIS. CAN THE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY EXPECTATION OF ANY RETURN FOR WHAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUN THE MONEY GOES INTO A SINGLE POOL. PEOPLE APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE AND IS PROVIDED FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS. AT A DEPTH ROUGHLY AT IS IT THREE THOUSAND OR HOW MANY PEOPLE. FOR ALMOST FOUR THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT THAT ARE OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FAN. A YOU SAID 40% OF THOSE BENEFICIARIES -- THAT GET TREATMENT GET TREATMENT ELSEWHERE OTHER THAN THESE TWO PROVIDERS IS THAT WHAT I UNDERSTOOD ALL NO I SAID WHAT I SAID WAS THAT A BILL APPROVED PROP PROVIDERS WHO REFERRED PEOPLE TO THE PROGRAM. 40% DON'T CONTRIBUTE THEY DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROGRAM RIGHT OKAY. AND BY JASON LOOK AT MY NOTES HERE. THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT TO MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OR THE SOME EXECUTIVE AT ONE OF THE FACILITIES THAT THE TWO ENTITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE DISCUSSING TODAY. AND THEY OPEN FIFTY NEW CLINICS -- WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING TO OPEN FIFTY NEW CLINICS WILL THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BE MAYBE. ONE PER COUNTY. M.. PARDON ME. SO. THAT THE ONE PER COUNTY I GUESS AND WE'RE ALL ABOUT AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SO I WOULD APPLAUD THEM IF THEY OPENED. HUNDRED SO WE HAVE TO ANNE'S COUNTY WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN BETTER SERVICE -- I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER DOES MAN -- I AT MISS MISSED BURTON AND I MISTER DOES WHEN I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I THINK YOU -- FOR EXPLAIN THAT I ALSO THINK THAT -- DID VISUAL THAT CAME UP AND GIVE US THAT COMMENT ON THE MEDICARE ISSUE DO YOU KNOW THE SPEND DOWN OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS I DON'T THINK THERE'S VERY MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE 53%. OF THE PEOPLE SAY THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE CAN LIVE ON SIX HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH EVEN IN MY AREA WHICH WAS DEEMED THE MOST AFFORDABLE -- I'VE I'VE BEEN GIVEN A LIST HERE. AS A HUNDRED FIFTEEN NAMES OF PEOPLE JUST LIKE MR DOES IN MY DISTRICT. THANK YOU AND I'M. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT COVERAGE GOING AWAY OR SPENDING DOWN. TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. AND SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS OKAY SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- AND OTHERS BEEN A LOT THAT'S BEEN SET AYE I WANT TO ASK THE FOUNDATION. CAN YOU SHARE WITH ME IF YOU GUYS ARE PROVIDE SERVICE TO UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS. YES WE DO. DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF OW MANY OF THOSE YOU SERVICE. I DO NOT BECAUSE WE DO NOT WE DO NOT -- REQUEST THAT INFORMATION SO I DO NOT KNOW THE NUMBER -- THE THE THE STATUS IS NOT A FACTOR THE FACTOR -- IS THE INCOME AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON MEETS THE EYE INCOME CRITERIA. THANK YOU -- I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION AND I GUESS AT THIS IS FOR THE THE CHAIR. WERE THERE ANY CONVERSATIONS I'M SORRY BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THE TURN I SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER AN HOUR. BUT SPEAKING ABOUT IN CHINA GO OVER SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND I DON'T REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION BUT DID WAS THERE ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MECHANISM AND MECHANISMS IN PLACE. TO PREVENT DOT EDU -- I THINK WE HEARD A TESTIMONY OR YOU'RE ABOUT -- TRYING TO CONVINCE PATIENTS TED TO GO ON CORPORATE IS WAS THERE ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEM. SERVICES CERTAINLY -- AND THE THE AT THE ALTAR AREA SO IT WILL CERTAINLY I THINK WE WENT TO THE BIG ISSUES THAT WERE TRIED DRESSED IN THIS. BILL WELL DOCTOR CAN SPEAK -- TWO THOUSAND BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT. BY THE ISSUES THAT THE AUTHORS STRAYED DRESSED IN THE BILL WHICH WE WORKED WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AROUND IS. MICHAEL SELF DEALING. AND SO FUNDAMENTALLY. THAT IS THE ISSUE OF V. -- OF BASICALLY A PROVIDER AND BY THE WAY I'M A PROVIDER SO I HAVE A PROVIDER AL THAT -- IF PROVIDER SAYING THAT WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. IF I CAN PAY THE IN I HAVE A PARTICULARLY GOOD DEAL WITH A PARTICULAR INSURANCE COMPANY OR SEVEN TURNS COMPANIES. AND I CAN FIND A WAY TO HAVE SOMEONE YOU KNOW THAT THAT I CAN PAY FOR THE FOR YOU KNOW CHANNEL MONEY NOT NECESSARY FOR THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT EVEN STATISTICALLY SEND MONEY TO A FOUNDATION THAT WILL THEN PAY THAT PREMIUM BECAUSE THE PREMIUMS ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE ACTUAL. REIMBURSEMENT RIGHT SO NOW STATES 20% RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS AT THE FIVE FOLD RETURN. SO I CAN GET SOME MONEY AND WHETHER AT AND SO FORTH AND THEN I CAN PUT MONEY INTO THAT. AND THEN I GET PAID FIVE TIMES ISN'T THAT STRONG DOWN THE RISK FULL FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE IN POLICY WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S SO THAT'S THE OVERALL IT SO THAT'S WHEN IT. THE OVERALL ISSUES NOW -- I WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. A CHAOS AND IT DOES HAVE -- YOU KNOW THEY DO NOT ENGAGE IN STEERAGE -- WHICH I KNOW THE OTHER FIRST OF ALL -- YOU AND ALLOW IT BUT ALSO WE DON'T YOU KNOW. ETCETERA IT IS MORE BILL IT IS -- THEY HAVE PLAYED THINGS IN PLACE YOU HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THEM THAT PROTECTED BUT THERE'S ALSO THE CHALLENGE OF IS THAT WHEN SENSUALLY. THE TO THE LARGEST PROVIDERS -- THEY'RE NOT AMY A PARTICULAR PATIENT RIGHT THAT'S ALL BLINDED AND SO FORTH BUT THE PROBLEM DOES RAISE SOME QUESTIONS OF WELL STATISTICALLY OF IGAVE SOME MONEY I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET LIKE A TWO THREE FOLDER FOR FOLDER RETURNED FROM DOING THIS FROM BUT MONEY PUT IN AND I'M. GOOD CHANCE THAT I'M GOING TO DO BETTER THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO PUT AN END SO THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO TRY. TO FIGURE OUT IS AS WELL NOT TO HAVE SO IT'S GOOD THAT'S MORE OF A STATISTICAL THING BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GET GAUGE ON THE VERY CLEAR A K. F. DOES NOT ENGAGE WE DO NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF AND THEY DO NOT. ENGAGE IN LIKE -- WELL GUESS WHAT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY GIVES THE MONEY AND THEN THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT GOES TO THAT THE PROVIDER THEY ARE BLIND TO THAT THAT'S A MONDAY NIGHT STAY OUR BLINDS YOU KNOW THEY GET THE MONEY THEY GIVE IT TO SOMEONE THEY THAT PERSON GOES. A PROVIDER THEY ARE NOT DIRECTED TO WHICH PROVIDER TO GOING TO THEY'RE NOT DIRECTING. EXACTLY -- WHICH INSURANCE COMPANY THAT SPECIFICALLY IT'S THE PATIENTS I SO THERE ARE THOSE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BUT THAT BUT THAT DOES AND I THINK WHAT YOU HEAR IS IS THAT. THE PROBLEM IS WHAT THE WHEN THE IS THAT. AN ARRANGEMENT DIG THIS THE THE CHALLENGE TO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND WE TALK ABOUT RAISING OVERALL PREMIUMS IS IS ABOUT. IS IS THAT YOU REALLY LEVERAGING THE RISK POOL WHICH IS BASICALLY ALL OF US WHO PRIDE FIVE INSURANCE WELL PAYING IN AND AND SO WHEN WE GET SICK WE IT COVERED RIGHT. SO THE CHALLENGES THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A PLACE YOU KNOW WHO'S ALREADY EXPENSIVE FIGURING YOU HAS NEEDS I SHOULD SAY. GRADY HAS NEEDS AND THEN SOMEONE SAYS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE A PRETTY GOOD POWER TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE IT'S ONLY. WERE VERY BIG PLAYER AND WE MAY BE THE ONLY DIALYSIS OR WHATEVER PROVIDER AT THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE IN THE AREA.% IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THE INSURER TO NEGOTIATE WITH NOW WE GOT A GOOD RATE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WELL THE PROBLEM IS A PATIENT CAN'T. YOU KNOW THE CAN OF THE DAY BASICALLY YOU COULD EITHER DO PUBLIC INSURANCE MEDICARE OR PRIVATE INSURANCE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE PAYS A LOT MORE AND SO I CAN PAY A LITTLE BIT AND I GET A LOT MORE. THAT'S THAT'S ON THE BACKS OF ACTUALLY. ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE PAYING INTO THE INSURANCE AND I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS -- BUT I WILL PERHAPS I SHOULD TURN IT TO THE AUTHOR TO SEE YOU TO IN TERMS OF THAT HE'S TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS AND WE WILL TRY TO WORK OUT AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO TO TO DEAL WITH. SO -- AND WE DO HAVE A MAN IS A SPECIFICALLY SAY KNOWS DURING WHICH AGAIN I KNOW A TF DOES NOT DO THAT KNOWS DURING BY THE AT AND BUT NO STRING BY THE FACILITY ITSELF REQUIRES FACILITIES TO POST INFORMATION WHERE CONSUMERS CAN GO TO GET OBJECTIVE INFORMATION ABOUT MEDICARE SO. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE. ACTORS INFORMATION. SO AND I PERHAPS YOU DO AND IF YOU WANNA BUT THE AUTHOR ALSO TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ALL THAT BECAUSE THANK YOU MY QUESTION -- WELL SO RIGHT NOW I HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS ONLY BECAUSE WHEN I I HEARD TO SAY RIGHT NOW ABOUT. THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION DOESN'T DIRECTLY. GET INVOLVED IN AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE PROFIT AND AND THE OTHER TWO ARE TARGETS THAT BEEN MENTIONED HERE WHICH IS I BELIEVE DE VITA AND PRESSING AS BUT I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THEY WERE PENALIZING THE FOUNDATION. AND THE ATTEMPT OF OF OF GOING AFTER THESE OTHER YOU KNOW. RECEIVED ABOUT PLAYERS AND WHEN I HEARD THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW THAT 40% OF OTHER PROVIDERS ALSO SEND PATIENTS TO YOU. AND THESE OTHER 40% PROVIDERS DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOUNDATION. AND SO I SEE THAT THAT'S ALSO REALLY HIGH NEED NOT JUST WITH THESE TWO THAT. THAT CONTRIBUTE BUT THESE OTHER PROVIDERS THAT ALSO SEE THE NEED -- AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M STRUGGLING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE KIDDING FOUNDATION IS TRYING TO DO GOOD WORK AND BECAUSE OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO TARGET I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE TAKING THE HEAD. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- I HEARD THE GENTLEMAN I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AG. AND YOU LITERALLY READ THE THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN BOTH OF YOU. AND I KEEP HEARING -- TO YOU WILL LEAVE CALIFORNIA IF THAT'S THE CASE AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS DISAGREEMENT. BUT I'M ALSO A LITTLE BUT YOU KNOW I WAS READING -- RIGHT NOW IS GOING OVER -- WHAT THE CHAIR READ WHICH WAS THE CONCLUSION TO OUR? COUNCIL AND EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEY WILL LEAVE THEY CONCLUDED BY SAYING HOWEVER IT'S THIS WOULD BE A FACTUAL DETERMINATION MADE BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND COULD INVOLVE CONSIDERATION OF FACTS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO US RIGHT NOW SO THERE IS AN UNKNOWN THEY HAVE NOT DEFINITIVELY SAD. THAT. THEY WON'T LEAVE OR OR WILL LEAVE THIS IS NOT A CERTAINTY FOR ME. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT BECAUSE I SPEND THE LAST TWO MONTHS MEETING WITH SOME OF THE PATIENTS IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS. THERE'S QUITE A BIT. AND I WANTED TO PUT A FACE TO TO THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETIMES WE GET INTO THE POLICY AREA BUT WE FORGET THAT THERE'S PEOPLE BEHIND THIS. I KNOW IT'S THIRTY THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED FROM WHAT I HEARD RIGHT NOW BUT I DO HAVE AROUND SIXTY SIX AND I WAS ABLE TO MEET WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE WELL AS? AND AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY FIT THE PROFILE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE THEY WERE. AND ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AND SOMEONE TRY TO DRAG HIM INTO ANOTHER AYE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE BENEFITING -- FROM THIS -- EXTRA HELP ONE OF THEM SAID THAT EVERY. SHE'S BEEN ON DIALYSIS FOR EIGHT YEARS AND EVERY I THINK THREE MONTHS IT'S LIKE ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED OR SO OUT OF POCKET THAT SHE CAN'T AFFORD -- SHE IS -- A SPECIALIST WITH THE LAPD IN DOWNTOWN LA AND SHE HAS A GOOD JOB A GOOD SITUATION BUT WHEN% SHE NEEDED TO HAVE DIALYSIS SHE STARTED FALLING ON HARD TIMES AND THIS WAS. WHAT SAVED -- AND SO I RIGHT NOW I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE IS NOT A PLAN . FOR THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS SO THAT'S WHERE MY FOCUS IS. WHAT I DO WITH THOSE THREE SEVEN WELL I'M NOT NECESSARY TALK ABOUT THEIR SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN IT'S THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT I MET IN MY DISTRICT -- THAT REALLY TRULY DEPEND ON THE SERVICE LIKE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR LAPSED AND AND COVERAGE IN SERVICE AND TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT I'M. NOT A PATIENT BUT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S REALLY TAX SCENE AND MENTALLY EXHAUSTING A PERHAPS VERY EMOTIONAL SO I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THAT TRANSITION PERIOD. LOOKS LIKE BUT I I WILL ALSO WRAP UP WITH THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW I ALSO AS YOU SURE YOU DO. COVER UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS AND AND I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN TELL ME HOW MANY OR WHAT THE AGES ARE BUT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME PEOPLE IN BETWEEN THEIR THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET. HELP ELSEWHERE AND SO I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THE CONCLUSION OF OUR LEGAL COUNSEL THAT SAYS THAT. THEY COULDN'T DEFINITIVELY SAY YES OR NO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR FAX AT THEIR DISPOSAL SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A PLAN BEFORE THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS. AND ASSURANCE THAT. THE KIDNEY FOUNDATION WILL LEAVE AND I'M NOT SURE I'M HEARING THAT ONE OR THE OTHER. I WILL CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE DISCUSSION BUT RIGHT NOW I'M CONFLICTED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I WANT PATIENTS TO GET CARE AND THAT'S MY STRUGGLE. SENATOR ME OUT MATCH COM AND AND AND MY COUNSEL MAY ALSO WANT TO ADD. THE THE THE THE POINT THAT YOU MAKE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MET WITH MAY NOT LOOK LIKE SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE IMAGINE I MINE. IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT IN THIS POPULATION WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED YOU KNOW ALL OF THEIR LIVES. LIKE MISTER DESMOND. M. THEY SUDDENLY KIDNEY DISEASE DEVELOP SOMETIMES OVER DECADES. BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE SYMPTOMS VERY OFTEN UNTIL YOU'RE IN FULL BLOWN KIDNEY FAILURE AND SO WHATEVER YOU HAVE SPENT WHATEVER YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AMASS OVER YOUR LIFE CAN BE GONE. IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. THE TO TAKE THE ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT COBRA. COBRA IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PUT A PERSON ON A PERSON IS WORKING AND EARNS COAL BUT TO CONTINUE BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY THE FULL PREMIUM. WE HELP THOSE PEOPLE. THERE IS THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING PAYING THEIR TAXES PAYING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE AND ALL OF THE OTHER ON THE SOUTH SEAS OF LIFE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THEIR INSURANCE THEY'RE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO WHAT THEY HAVE. SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEMSELVES TO KEEP THEMSELVES WELL AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT DISTINCTION AND WE WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. MISTER WOOD AND ERIC A SOME WOMEN WOULD AND AND SENATE OPINION TO TRY TO GET. TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES OF THAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT UP WE WE'VE WE'VE OFFERED CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO DEAL WITH THE FACT. THAT HOW DO WE PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUING THE COVERAGE THAT THEY'VE HAD ALL ALONG THOSE ARE REALLY VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS. WELL AND AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT LIKE I SAID I DON'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION UP HERE NOT. KNOW WHO I WAS TALKING ABOUT SO WHEN I MET WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS. I MEAN WELL EDUCATED AS YOU STATED THEY WORKED ALL THEIR LIVES IN THE YOU KNOW HOW PROFESSIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW QUITE -- IMPRESSIVE AND YET YOU KNOW WHEN THEY STARTED YOU KNOW EIGHT YEARS -- SHE SAID SHE WENT TO HER SAVINGS AND THEN -- SHE WAS STRUGGLING JUST TO EVEN PAY FOR HER AND SHE TOOK OUT LOANS AND THEN IT BECAME A CYCLE MY POINT IS THAT. IT YOU KNOW SHE JUST NEEDED HELP AND AS SHE WAS ABLE TO GO TO THAT IS THE FOUNDATION AN AND SO AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT SHE DID EVERYTHING. CORRECTLY AND THEN SHE WASN'T ANTICIPATING THIS ILLNESS -- BUT AGAIN I REALLY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND THESE ARE PEOPLE MY DISTRICT BY MATT ONE ON ONE WHO SHARE THEIR STORIES AND AND SO AGAIN I STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT THAT I LIKE I SAID I YOU KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO GET INFORMATION TO LEASE BUT YET I FEEL LIKE THERE'S AN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER IT WILL LEAVE OR NOT AND AND SO THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME WHEN I DON'T HAVE LIKE A CERTAIN ANSWER. THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING IF THERE WAS SOME KIND OF PROTECTIONS THAT WE CAN. PUT IN PLACE SO THERE IS NO STEERING AS THEY CALLED IT AND BUT I DID HEAR DOCTOR POUND SAY THAT YOU DON'T. PARTICIPATE IN THAT THAT THERE'S SAFEGUARDS AGAINST THAT AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST SO. SO I AGAIN I'M I'M STILL A LITTLE CONFLICTED SO AGAIN -- CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION IF I MIGHT CALL ON OUR GENERAL COUNSEL TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT LAST STATEMENT AND THE LEDGE COUNCIL YES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER -- CENTER MITCHELL LAST QUESTION EARLIER WHAT WHAT IS THE GOVERNING BODY OF AND I THINK WHAT SHE MEANT WAS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PROGRAM BECAUSE OF COURSE THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND. IS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE NATIONAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES OR TWENTY FIVE THE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PROGRAM HIT THAT WERE HERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. IS GOVERNED BY NONE OTHER THAN THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND SPECIFICALLY. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ADVISORY OPINION NINETY SEVEN DASH. ONE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS CONCLUDED. THAT ASSEMBLYMAN WOODS BILL TO NINETY CONFLICTS WITH ALONE ON ON ON AND THAT'S NOT TRUE LET'S LET'S LET'S OKAY YOU PULL THAT ONE SENTENCE. RIGHT I READ THE CONCLUSION NOW I COULD READ THE WHOLE MEMO BUT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE THAT AND ANALYSIS AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THEM. BUT I READ THE SUMMARY. I MEAN IN THAT SO YOU TOLD ONE LINE OUT AND THERE'S A SUMMARY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS COUNSEL FOR THE AMERICAN CAN YOU FOUNDATION. YOU HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION I RESPECT THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR OWN LEGAL OPINION THIS IS THE LEAD COUNSEL FOR THE LEGISLATURE YOU CAN CERTAINLY DISAGREE. RIGHT THE HEALTH LAWYERS CAN DISAGREE THAT'S FINE BUT I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO MISS CHARACTERIZE. WHAT ARE LEDGE COUNCIL HAS TOLD US OKAY TO SPEAK FOR THE AMERICAN GINNY FOUNDATION SPEAK FOR YOUNG LEGAL OPINION BUT DON'T CLAIM THE LEDGE COUNCIL? OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE SAID SOMETHING THEY DID NOT SAY ALL RIGHT SO I JUST WANT I WARN YOU. PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT YOU KNOW IF I MADE THAT THAT KINDA SATISFIES LIKE AS I WAS JUST SHARING SOME OF MY CONCERNS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO THE FIGHT. MAY I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SPANISH SPEAKING. OF PEOPLE HERE WHO CAME WHO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND I ALSO LIKE TO SAY TO THEM IN SPANISH IF. YOU ALLOW ME. GETTY OTHER SEATTLE OFFICE ON NORTH CAROLINA'S MANUAL GIVING AND ON UP IN THE U. K. UP WILLIAM ASSIST OPERABLE HE'S FOR PROPUESTAS LA YES. GET ALREADY DIALECTICAL BUT SIMPLY LOOK AT THIS ME SAID THE SCANDAL BASED ON OFFICE AND I YOU THEM THOUGH. GET THAT I GOT AND I YOU KNOW THAT THEY LEFT FROM THE CEILING. YOUR ETERNAL TENEMOS BLIND BUT I THAT I LIKE HAND PICKED LIST AS ME SAID THAT SINCE I'VE HAD THIS GAME. NO ONE UP IN A PLAN BUT I BUT I YOU THAT ONCE -- MEDICAMENTO E. OKAY THE OTHER CBO NOMINADA THEY CAME OUT THEY WOULD OUT AND GETS US. DOES HE WANT TO MEET PERSONA. TO BE UNLIKELY THAT CAN ASSIST SEAT THEM BY MERELY IMPORTANT BEEN ONLY HAD I NOT BEEN SEEN THANK CUIDADO. I MEAN BUT I DON'T DAY SEE. DONNA YOU THAT. ALL I CAN THINK IN THE COMMENTS ABOUT SHARE MY CONCERNS WITH YOU GUYS. ALL RIGHT SIR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THIS OPINION THAT A K. F. IS USING. AM I CORRECT IN THAT THAT OPINION WAS RENDERED IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SO IT'S TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD YES YOU ARE CORRECT BUT IT HAS BEEN REVIEWED OVER THE OVER THE COURSE OF OF TIME SINCE THEN SO WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED HIM FOR OPINION ON THIS. YOU DO NOT GO BACK AND ASK FOR A SUBSEQUENT OPINION BUT THE ID CONTINUES TO ISSUE OPINIONS IN THE SAME AREA -- AND A FEW YEARS AGO THEY DID A REVIEW ACROSS THE BOARD -- OF OPINIONS IN GENERAL. IS THERE ARE SOME MIGHT WANT TO COMMENT I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE NUYS AT TRUE WE CAN'T ELSE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR AN OPINION ON THE KNOB I'M SORRY I'M I'M. MAY HAVE MISS -- MAY NOT OF ANSWER THAT QUITE AS I INTENDED I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE CANNOT ASK THEM YOU ASKED ME WHEN WAS IT RE REVIEWED. I WAS SIMPLY SAYING THAT THE PROCESS IS NOT FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO HAVE AN OPINION TO GO BACK EVERY SO MANY YEARS AND SAY WOULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MY OPINION AGAIN BUT THE ID DOES SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUE ADDITIONAL OPINIONS. THAT YOU FOLLOW IN YOUR REVIEW NOW I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU SO MY QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THEIR OPINION WHY WOULD YOU NOT GO TO THEM. YESTERDAY WHEN THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED AND ASK THEM FOR AN OPINION IF THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN THE LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS. THE THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS IS THAT NUMBER -- ONE THE WE WOULD NOT RECEIVE QUITE FRANKLY A TIMELY RESPONSE ON THAT KIND OF OF OF OF QUESTION WE CAN READ OUR OPINION AS WE HAVE DONE. BUT THE CRITICAL THING HERE AND I WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE LEDGE COUNCIL SAID SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T SAY. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE IMPLYING -- BE AND AND I GREW TO THAT CONCLUSION IS WHAT THEY SAID. WHAT WE ARE AT YOUR OWN OPINION THAT'S FINE BUT DON'T MISS REPRESENTS A RITE WHAT WHAT I'M SAYING SIR IS THAT? WHAT IS REALLY CRITICAL IS WHAT SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT WAS APPROVED YOU CAN ALL PINE ON? WHAT ELSE MIGHT HAPPEN? WHAT WE'RE REFERRING TO IN THE LEDGE COUNCIL LETTER IS THAT THEY SAID THIS ARRANGEMENT GOALS BEYOND INTO NANI GOALS BEYOND WHAT YOU ARE APPROVED? IT GOES BEYOND THAT AND THEN THEY OPINED ON HOW OLD THE I. G. MIGHT RE INTERPRET WERE THEY TO REVIEW THE WHOLE THING ALL TOGETHER AGAIN AND SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE IG WITH THAT APPROVE THAT. AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION. WE CANNOT STEP OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THE SAFETY OF KNOWING WHAT WE'RE DOING IS FOLLOWING THE RULES AND INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT ON WHAT THEY MIGHT APPROVED GOING FORWARD. SO BACK TO ME THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR DRESSING THE CHAIR BUT BACK TO MY QUESTION WHY WOULD YOU NOT HOUSE THEM FOR AN UPDATED OPINION WE'VE HAD SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT TODAY. AND TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LOGICAL IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING THAT YOU WOULD LEAVE CALIFORNIA BASED ON THIS TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD DECISION I WOULD GO TO THEM AND SAY IT'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CAN WE GET. AN UPDATED OPINION OR DOES YOUR OPINION WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN TIS COUNTRY NATIONWIDE WHO ARE DEPENDENT UPON THIS PROGRAM WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE ACTION THAT WE THINK IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE. AND IT IS TRUE THAT WE WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONFER WITH THE ID BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE STEP AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ASK FOR AN ADDITIONAL OPINION OR ASK FOR RE REVIEW. IT'S GOING TO DEPEND UPON WHAT WE THINK IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS THAT WE ASSIST NATIONWIDE OKAY SO THIS IS A CALIFORNIA DECISIONS IS A CALIFORNIA BILL. SO JUST IT IT IT'S FINE I OUSTED YOU DON'T HAVE AN NSWER -- JONES DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK JUST A MOMENT AND I I APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE A CALF DID. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ALONG WITH. SEVEN AS SEVEN DIALYSIS COMPANIES. ARMORS SIX BILLION ABOUT AN ITEM THAT BUT A UNNAMED DIALYSIS COMPANIES SEEK AN OPINION FROM THE IG. SO IT WAS NOT THE O. I. G.. MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS OPINION IN THE ABSENCE OF A REQUEST IT WAS THE A CALF AND DIALYSIS PROVIDERS. pIG APPROVED WAS AN ARRANGEMENT THAT HAD SUBSTANTIAL GUARD RAILS SOME OF THOSE GUARD RAILS WERE THAT THE COMPANIES WOULD NOT. ADVERTISE PUBLICLY. THE HIT PROGRAM THE A CAPS PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT THEY WOULD NOT DISCLOSE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO PATIENTS THAT THE THAT THE PROVIDER CONTRIBUTED -- THOSE REALLY ARE SOME OF THE THE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THEIR OTHER. GUARD RAILS IN PLACE BUT THOSE ARE ARE PRETTY CRAPPY ONES AND THOSE THE SITUATIONS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS -- BUT THAT'S REALLY A LOT OF WHERE THE A CALF IS HINGING THEIR CONCERN AND CLAIMING THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA -- WITH REGARD TO THE DISCLOSURE TO PATIENTS. WE TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY THE A CAPS CONCERNED THAT THE BILL COULD THROUGH AS THE LEGISLATURE CALLED IN IT AT THE LEDGE COUNCIL CALLD AN ATTENUATED PROCESS. THAT A PATIENT COULD BECOME AWARE THAT THEIR CLINIC. WE TOOK THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND SO. WE AMEND WE AMENDED THE BILL. WE TOOK AMENDMENTS -- DOCTOR WHAT AMENDED THE BILL TO PREVENT IN ANY WAY THE DISCLOSURE OF A CLINICS PROVIDER STATUS. AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS THAT FOR EVERY OTHER TYPE OF PROVIDER IN THE STATE. THEY WOULD BE DEEMED FINANCIALLY INTERESTED. IF THEY ARE EITHER PAYING A PATIENTS PREMIUMS. OR IF THEY ARE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS CONSIDERED FINANCIALLY INTERESTED. WE CREATED A NEW ENTIRELY NEW CATEGORY. OF FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ENTITY THAT THE THAT ENCOMPASSES DIALYSIS CLINICS. AND THE LEGISLATION IS CURRENTLY AT SECTION -- F. TO SEE WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO THE MOVE TO G. TO SEE IF YOU WANT TO READ IT -- SAYS THAT FOR A DIALYSIS CLINIC TO BE CONSIDERED FINANCIALLY INTERESTED. THEY EITHER HAVE AT LEAST A 10% MARKET SHARE IN CALIFORNIA OR CONSIDERED A LARGE DIALYSIS ORGANIZATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CLINICS NATIONALLY. THAT MEANS THE PROVIDER STATUS THE PROVIDER -- CONTRIBUTE CONTRIBUTE CONTRIBUTOR STATUS THE A CALF NOW HAS NOTHING TO DO. WITH WHETHER A CLINIC IS CONSIDERED FINANCIALLY INTERESTED UNDER THE BILL. AND THAT IS VERY CLEAR -- WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE IS NOW ZERO CHANCE BUT THE A CALF WOULD BE DISCLOSING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO A PATIENT? THAT THE CLINIC IS A CONTRIBUTOR THE A CALF WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS FOR ALL PATIENTS FOR WHOM. IT RIGHTS GRANTS THAT WOULD MEAN CONTRIBUTOR CLINICS AND NON CONTRIBUTOR CLINICS ALIKE -- WE'VE MADE THIS UNIFORM EVEN THOUGH THE BILL NO LONGER WOULD APPLY TO SOME CLINICS WHO ARE CONTRIBUTORS. BECAUSE THOSE CLINICS BELONG TO SMALLER SYSTEMS ARE INDEPENDENT CYST OR INDEPENDENT CLINICS. AND DO NOT HAVE THE MARKET SHARE TO BE DEMANDING THE INCREDIBLY EXORBITANT COMMERCIAL RATES -- SO WE HAVE WE TOOK THE A CHAOS CONCERN. BROKE THAT LINKAGE WHICH MEANS THAT WE NOW FEEL THAT IT IS DISINGENUOUS BE CLAIMING THAT. THAT PART OF THE O. I. G. MEMO IS. EVEN AT RISK OF BEING VIOLATED BEFORE THEY GO BACK TO A NEW A NEW -- IG OPINION HOWEVER. THE DIALYSIS COMPANIES DO ROUTINELY VIOLATE THE O. I. G.'S. FOR EXAMPLE CURRENTLY AS OF AN HOUR IN TWO HOURS AGO NOW ON TO THE THIS WEBSITE IS AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE PUBLIC REGARDING THE AMERICAN THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND. AND HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PROGRAM. IS UNDER AN FAQ REGARD -- FOR PATIENTS SEEKING TO A PAYMENT FOR THEIR COBRA COVERAGE. THAT IS A PLANE LETTER VIOLATION. OF THE IG OPINION. ALSO INTEL IF YOU YEARS AGO BOTH THE VITA AND FRESENIUS ROUTINELY IN THEIR SEC FILINGS STATED. BUT THERE IS. PREMIUM ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE FROM THE A CALF AND THE COMPANY AS WITH MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS CONTRIBUTES TO THE A. K. YEAH. SO IF THOSE TYPES OF PLAIN LANGUAGE IN PRINT VIOLATIONS ARE NOT CAUSING THE A. K. F.. HARPER. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH GREAT LENGTHS IN THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOT AN A VIOLATION OF THE O. I. G. OPINION BECAUSE WE DO WANT THE A CALF TO CONTINUE. WE DO FEEL THAT THE A CALF PROVIDES A VALUABLE SERVICE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER TO WRITE A BILL. THAT WOULD HAVE. DISALLOWED THIRD PARTY PREMIUM PAYMENT THE BILL EXPLICITLY STATES THE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS HAVE TO ACCEPT THESE PAYMENTS. AND IT'S IN THE A CALF WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WE VALUE THE A. K. F. AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE CAL IN CALIFORNIA AS AN OPTION FOR PATIENTS. AND FEEL THAT WE HAVE SATISFIED THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU JOHN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OKAY CENTER TADO. QUESTION [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND OTHERS FORWARD ON I WANT TO START EXPRESS SEED -- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I ADMIRE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND AND WORK ON IMPROVING -- GET ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN THE STATE IN MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE [inaudible] AND YOU KNOW I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE ISSUES THAT THE YOU HAVE RAISED HERE TODAY AND THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THROUGH THIS BILL. I AM NOT A A FAN OF BIG PROFITS AND OBVIOUSLY I NOT A FAN OF INCREASED HEALTH CARE COST FOR THE CONSUMERS -- AND I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND AND PRETEND THAT I HAVE A SOLUTION OR THAT. MY POSITION IS THAT. THE CORRECT POSITION OR THAT YOUR POSITION IS IS THE WRONG POSITION NOT OR THAT I KNOW IT ALL RIGHT I THINK THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE GOING BACK AND FORTH. AND WE WON'T KNOW. WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG UNTIL AFTER THE FACT AND SO -- BUT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU MY OPPOSITION TO TO TO THE BILL TODAY AND BECAUSE IT'S A DEEPLY PERSONAL ONE TO ME -- YOU KNOW ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO MY GRANDMOTHER. PASSED AWAY SHE HAD BEEN ON DIALYSIS FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. AND WHEN WE FIRST WE KNEW THAT SHE HAD CHALLENGES WITH DIABETES AND AND WHATNOT -- BUT WHEN WE LEARNED THAT SHE HAD. TO YOU KNOW TAKE A DO DIALYSIS TREATMENT -- WE DIDN'T ASK. YOU KNOW HOW BIG ARE YOUR PROFITS. WE WERE WORRIED AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE TREATMENT THAT SHE NEEDED TO SURVIVE. BECAUSE DIALYSIS TREATMENT AS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH. IT IS NOT A JOKE IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE PLAYED WITH IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SERIOUS -- EVEN MORE SO TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE THREE COUSINS ON DIALYSIS RIGHT NOW RELATIVE ON MY FATHER'S SIDE HAS PASSED AWAY BECAUSE OF KIDNEY FAILURE. ALL HAVE HAD TO YOU KNOW GO THROUGH DIALYSIS TREATMENT. SO WE CAN SIT HERE AND DEBATE ALL DAY WHO IS RIGHT WHO IS WRONG WHO IS LINE WAS NOT LINE. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER OF WHOSE LINE WHO'S NOT WHO'S RIGHT WHO'S WRONG I DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER ALL I KNOW IS THAT. MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS THAT. THE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT MY RELATIVES MY LOVED ONES AT THE POTENTIALLY ME EVEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE KIDNEY DISEASE KIDNEY FAILURE RUNS IN MY FAMILY. THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE TREATMENT THAT WE NEED BECAUSE THIS IS A TREATMENT THAT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE. IT'S FATAL YOU'D DIE. AND I THINK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WOULD PAY WHATEVER IT WOULD. YOU KNOW OF TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR LOVED. STATE ALIVE AND FOR ME THAT'S THE REASON WHY I'M VOTING NO TODAY. VERY SIMPLE IT'S IT'S I I WANT TO YOU KNOW WISH YOU SUCCESS I I HOPE IT THIS ALL WORKS OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS OUR LEGITIMATE. ISSUES -- BUT FOR ME IT'S I DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT RISK. IT IN IT YOU KNOW ON THE TABLE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT I CAN YOU KNOW CARE ABOUT AND THE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT AND BEYOND. THREE I WILL RESPECTFULLY -- OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY. CENTER AND SALAS. YES THANK YOU AND THANK YOU -- EVERYBODY WHO SPOKE AND ALREADY I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTIONS AND DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS I APPRECIATE THAT AND THANK YOU TO DOCTOR PAN. FOR WORKING VERY HARD AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR THIS I APPRECIATE YOUR YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY -- A COUPLE QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY AND THE NEW PER PERSON ON THAT THE SENATE'S ASIDE. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR HERE SO WHAT IS THE PER MEDICARE DIALYSIS TREATMENT VERSES THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE -- DO WE HAVE THOSE THOSE TWO NUMBERS. THEM MEDICARE IF SOMEONE WERE TO GO THROUGH MEDICARE OUT WHAT'S THAT REIMBURSEMENT MEANT RATE VERSES THE AMERICAN CAN YEAH THAT IS NOT INFORMATION THAT I WOULD WOULD HAVE ONE OF OUR FIRE WALLS IS THAT WE DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OF DIALYSIS CENTERS OKAY. WELL I THINK IT'S FROM. FROM WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS VERSUS FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS SO MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION BUT I'VE BEEN LOOKING YOU KNOW EVERYWHERE SO IT LOOKS LIKE I DO HAVE ONE BIT OF INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. I THINK THAT FIGURE THAT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR FIGURE WAS WIDELY INCLUDED IN NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLES -- I DON'T I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBERS BUT THERE IS THERE IS WIDE VARIATION ALL AMONG THEM AND THOSE ARE NEGOTIATED RATES BUT I CAN'T SPEAK -- TO AYE AYE I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THAT IS THAT IS OUTSIDE THE NORM BUT I CANNOT SPEAK TO SPECIFIC RATES BECAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION. OKAY THANK YOU -- I GUESS ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. IS THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND I'M JUST WONDERING -- YOU DO SOME SUCH GREAT WORK AS EVERYBODY SAID FOR FIVE STAR -- AND HOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH PATIENTS ON THE FRONT END VERSUS THE BACKEND -- ARE YOU INFORMING THEM OUR MESSAGING TO THEM THAT THEY YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE BEFORE. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS OTHER ROUTE THROUGH COMMERCIAL OUR WORK IS NOT JUST WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN KIDNEY FAILURE. IT'S TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE SYMPTOMS THAT IF THEY'VE GOT CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT THEY'VE GOT A FAMILY HISTORY. IF THEY'VE GOT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR THEY GOT DIABETES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAN THEY NEED TO GET TESTED WE GO IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY -- WE USE OUR WEBSITE IS A VERY EFFICIENT WAY OF GETTING ON INFORMATION AND AND RECENTLY WE HAVE STARTED SOME EFFORTS TO NOT ONLY GET OUT AND SCREEN AND TALK AND PROVIDE EDUCATION -- BUT TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THEN IF A PERSON IS KßT IN KIDNEY FAILURE WE NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM HAVE THE BEST OUTCOMES. SO WE ARE AGAIN PROVIDING EDUCATION AND SUPPORT -- AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PATIENTS TO BE MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER SO THAT THEY GET THE BEST OUTCOMES POSSIBLE SO WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE WITH A WIDE RANGE OF THINGS WITH REGARD TO HEALTH INSURANCE WE DO NOT ADVISE PEOPLE ON HEALTH INSURANCE. PEOPLE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ON HEALTH INSURANCE AND ON DIE DIALYSIS PROVIDERS AND THEIR OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS BEFORE THEY COME TO US AND IF THEY QUALIFY FINANCIALLY FOR ASSISTANCE THEN WE WILL PROVIDE. OKAY -- WELL THAT IS WHERE I-FEEL REALLY UNSETTLED IS THAT YOU KNOW I I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE PATIENTS ARE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A LOT OF AND MISINFORMATION AS IT YEAH. AS MISTER DESMOND SAID HERE. YOU KNOW HE WASN'T REALLY SURE IT SEEMS LIKE OF THE OPTIONS -- AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE PATIENTS THAT ARE IN MY DISTRICT -- ALSO DON'T KNOW THEIR OPTIONS AS WELL SOME AND I'M AND SETTLED WITH THEM NOT KNOWING WHETHER THEY CAN GO THROUGH MEDI CAL MEDICARE. A PRIVATE OPTION. AND JUST THE SAME MESSAGING -- IS THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET TRANSPLANTS AND YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A LOT OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE SO FOR THAT REASON. AND I RESPECT CERTAINLY WHAT YOU DO AND I THINK -- YOU FOR THE INFORMATION AS WELL YOU KNOW I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I DO THINK -- WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO PUT OUR PATIENTS FIRST AND I HOPE THAT THAT. WILL GO BEYOND ANYTHING ELSE -- HERE THANK YOU. OKAY SIR GROVE [inaudible] YES YES. ADD ONE COMMENT OR QUESTION. THAT I WANTED TO ASK -- THERE IS A COMMENTS MADE EARLIER ABOUT WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TEAMS THAT ARE THE OFFICES BUDGET WHAT YOU GO BACK AND GET A REVIEW. IS DOES THAT REVIEW COME WITHOUT RISK. IT DOES NOT. SO YOU WOULD BE JEOPARDIZING IF IT WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS ACROSS THE NATION. OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS THAT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BE SOMETHING ELSE IS THAT WE HAVE THAT THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN OPINION -- WHICH IS JUST FIVE YEARS OLD THAT ADDRESSES A NINETY SEVEN POINT -- ONE IN AFFIRMS THAT DECISION SO JUST FOR FY IN YOUR COUNSEL MAY KNOW THAT -- A THAT'SIT THAT'S IT I GUESS THAT AND IF I MIGHT ADD I THINK THOSE OF BY APPRECIATE THOSE VERY IMPORTANT POINTS. THAT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO -- AN ORGANIZATION CALLED HEARING VOICES HAD THEIR ADVISORY OPINION ALL WITHDRAWN BECAUSE THEY SHARE PATIENT INFORMATION ON WHO THEY WERE ASSISTING. SO IF I MEAN I'M A SENIOR SHARING PATIENT INFORMATION BUT IF YOU'RE ADVISORY OPINIONS WITH DRAWN. WHAT HAPPENS THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FAN AND THEN THERE FOR THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE LIKE MR DESMOND OR SOLD FIVE THOUSAND SEVENTY FIVE TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WOULD BE WITHOUT OUR ASSISTANCE AT THE OPINION WERE WITHDRAWN? AND I GUESS AGAIN MIGHT MIGHT HUGE CONCERN I HAVE IS. IF IT IS WITH IF IF FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU CEASE TO EXIST WHAT WHAT HAPPENS LIKE. LIKE I KNOW I THE OTHER BILL BEFORE ASKED IF I THOUGHT YOU HAD A BACKUP PLAN BUT IF IF AMERICAN CAN DEFEND LEAVES CALIFORNIA. IS THERE A BACK UP PLAN THAT WE IMMEDIATELY RESPOND. TO TO HELP PEOPLE OR DO THEY HAVE TO JUST SPIN DOWN THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS ARE LIFE EVERYTHING TO SIX ON OUR BACKS. SO I GUESS MY I HAVE IT THAT'S MY HUGE THAT'S MY THING SO ALL THE STUFF ON THE OUTSIDE BUT WHO CONTRIBUTE TO DOESN'T COMPUTERS TO THE PLANS PAY. I MY CONCERN IS THESE. THESE PEOPLE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN IN CALIFORNIA'S SEVEN FIVE THOUSAND OBVIOUSLY CROSS THE NATION BUT YOU KNOW OF A HUNDRED OF THEM IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE JUST LIKE THAT TO WOMEN SITTING. RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF US SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY A CENTER MITCHELL. THE QUESTION POLLS ABOUT -- OF YOUR THIRTY SEVEN YOU YOU STATED THAT YOU DO PROVIDE SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER COULD YOU GIVE ME GENERAL PERCENTAGE BECAUSE WE'VE EXPRESSED SUCH CONCERN ABOUT THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED I I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL IDEA. OF THE PERCENTAGE. I DO NOT HAVE I DO NOT HAVE SUCH A NUMBER. AND NO ONE CAN GET THAT FOR US WHILE WE'RE HERE. WE AS I MENTIONED WE DON'T ASK YOU DON'T ASK THE QUESTION OKAY -- JUST WANTED BECAUSE AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEING CONCERNED ABOUT ON ACCESS TO CARE AND THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED RECOGNIZING -- THAT -- MANY UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS -- AND BECAUSE OF LACK OF ACTION BY THIS LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE ACCESS MAGICALLY LOW INCOME BECAUSE WE'VE NOT EXPANDED MEDICAID OUT TO ALL THE THAT'S ONE SIGNIFICANT WAY IN WHICH WE COULD MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH COVERAGE. SO IF I WERE TO GET A SENSE OF THE PERCENTAGE THAT THAT -- BY LACK OF ACTION BY THIS LEGISLATURE COULD INDEED BE COVERED AND HAVE THE FULL COMPREHENSIVE -- PACKAGE OF SERVICES SO THANK YOU MAY I CAN. SHOWED A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT ON THAT. PLEASE. OF IN OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTEEN TO VETO -- ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE STATING THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER ASSIST PATIENTS. WHO WERE IN EMERGENCY ONLY MEDICAID IN SEEKING GRANTS FROM THE A CALF -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN DEFEATED ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE SAID THEY WOULD NO LONGER ALLOW. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EMERGENCY MEDICARE AL. WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND THAT TO MEAN UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FROM BEING ABLE TO PURSUE I SEE YOU'VE TURNED YOUR LIGHT ON WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND YES BECAUSE I I CANNOT SPEAK TO THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT PRESS RELEASE BUT I CAN TELL YOU. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN COME DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUN AND APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE. BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER RIGHT BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH A DIALYSIS PROVIDER TO APPLY FOR SITE YOU STILL DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION I APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION. OKAY. SEE NO THE QUESTIONS I A TO SAID A FEW QUESTIONS OF MY OWN I WISH TO POSE SO -- I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE WITH JUDGE GENERAL COUNSEL AND A SO. YOU HAVE STATED HERE IN THIS HEARING ON PUBLIC RECORD THAT YOU WILL LEAVE CALIFORNIA -- MISTER DESMOND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE I BELIEVE YOU MAY BE MORE LIKE CONSTITUENTS SO THANK YOU -- SO ACTUALLY THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT MR DOES MEN DIRECTLY BECAUSE HE DOES NOT FALL IN THE CATEGORY IS NOT HAVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. ARE YOU SAYING THE A TF WILL PULL OUT OF EVERY PATIENT IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ONES WHO WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED SO DURING YOUR COUNSEL'S HERE IS TO USE IT SO THIS WOULD NOT. SO THE I DID DID YOU SO MISTER DESMOND WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED DOWN YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO HIM WITHOUT THE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL THIS IS THE WOULD NOT FALL UNDER THE IG SO YOUR YOUR YOUR OWN OPINION RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE A COUNCIL SAYS. WELL THIS WILL MAKE YOU DO SOME SO YOU'RE NOT HAVE TO REPORT ANY INSURANCE COMPANY MISTER DESMOND BECAUSE HE'S NOT SO BECAUSE THAT FALLS OUTSIDE OF THIS BILL SO ARE YOU SO I JUST WANNA BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING WITH YOUR COUNSEL NEXT TO YOU WHAT. DID VICE YOU YOU SAY THAT YOU WILL BE DOING FOR THE RECORD ON THE PUBLIC RECORD YOU ARE SAYING AMERICANS ANY FUNCTION OF COMPOUND ATION WELL THEY ABANDONED MISTER DOES MEN AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM WHO ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THE BILL. WE HAVE TO TREAT ALL. NO I JUST YES OR NO THE ANSWER IS WE WILL PULL OUT FOR ALL PLANS INCLUDING INCLUDING OKAY SO BASICALLY YOU'RE PUTTING A GUN TO OUR HEAD OKAY THANK YOU -- I APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY -- YOU KNOW I A I A BECAUSE THERE ARE PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS BILL AND CERTAINLY AGAIN YOUR I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE. YOUR OPINION -- FROM YOUR COUNSEL AND CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOUR COUNSEL GETTING YOU CERTAIN OPINION AS WELL -- NO I IT'S THAT SAID WE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT LEGAL OPINION BUT AGAIN YOUR COUNSEL IS YOUR COUNCIL SO YOU DO NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM. ICE AND UNDER CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT POSITION -- I I DO THINK THAT THIS IS PERHAPS MORE OF A CHOICE. THAT YOU'RE MAKING MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BUT YEAH I YEAH SO I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN MOVE -- I AM A BIT FRUSTRATED YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO HERE AND YOU CAME TO MY OFFICE AND MANY OTHERS AS WELL -- YOU KNOW I HAVE I HAVE TREMENDOUS YOU KNOW I TREMENDOUS SYMPATHY. INITIALLY FOR WHAT YOU ARE EXPRESSING. BUT I HAVE TO SAY. AND ACTUALLY I'M SORRY SIR HER TAUGHT IT WAS NEARLY OF THAT A FAMILY MEMBER WHO NEED DIALYSIS AS WELL. OKAY SO I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IT IS LIFE. BUT IT'S LIFESAVING IT'S THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU'LL DIE. RIGHT I MEAN IT IS THAT CRITICAL AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TAUGHT US SAYS I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT MYSELF. RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND -- CERTAINLY HEAR WHAT CENTER GROVE IS SAYING AS WELL. ALL RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW HIS EVEN BETTER NINETY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE YOUR FOUNDATION IS [inaudible] RIGHT. THAT IS EXACTLY AND SO -- BECAUSE IT'S SO CRITICAL. BECAUSE IT'S SO CRITICAL. WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. THAT IN. OUR DESIRE NOT JUST DESIRE NEED NECESSITY OF BEING SURE THAT THESE PATIENTS GET THE CARE THEY NEED. AND THAT'S WHY SHE WHY BY THE WAY CONGRESS DECIDE INCLUDE AS PART OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN THE SEVENTIES I MEAN IT'S KIND OF A UNIQUE. PIECE STATE ENTERED AT OKAY -- WE ALSO HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE WAY WE STRUCTURE THIS. ISN'T IN A WAY THAT IS -- THAT THERE'S EITHER REALITY MOST IMPORTANTLY BY EVEN THE PERCEPTION. THAT. THESE PATIENTS ARE NOW AN OPPORTUNITY. TO THEN MAKE -- YEAH TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL GAIN BECAUSE REALLY WE ARE WE ARE WE NEED TO STEP UP TO FIGURE THAT OUT RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT LIKE I'M TAL OF FOR YARDS RIGHT HOSPITAL'S BASICALLY HAVE TO SWALLOW THE CLASS. AND SOMETIMES YOU DO HEAR PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT. WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR IT I'VE HEARD THAT STATEMENT MADE BEFORE BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM? THE HOSPITAL THEY SHOULD TO SWALLOW THE COST THE EARTH ETCETERA BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GONNA DO A YOUNG ABANDONED THEM AND LIKE NO WE DON'T WANT ABANDONED BUT IT TAKES MONEY TO RUN. THE E. ARE RIGHT AND SO I UNDERSTAND IT TAKES MONEY TO RUN THE DIALYSIS CENTERS BUT THE SAME TIME. WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A MENTION BEFORE AND I DISCUSSIONS IS THAT -- WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ALSO A SITUATION WE'RE RECREATING -- THAT -- THAT BASICALLY SAYS -- WHERE ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GOOD SO SUCH A NECESSITY TAKE CARE OF THEM? THESE PATIENTS THAT SOMEONE SAYS WELL THAT'S GREAT AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT I CAN -- HAVE A CREW DEL WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD. TO WE HAVE A FOUNDATION WE'RE GONNA CHANNEL SOME MONEY THERE AND THAT THEN WILL HAVE ALLOW US TO MAKE. YOU KNOW FRANKLY MORE MONEY OFF OF THAT THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THE COSTS ARE COVERED THAT'S BY THE WAY WHY I INSISTED AND AND I'M APPRECIATE TO SUMMER WOULD ADDING TO HIS BILL -- A MECHANISM TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT IF THE MEDICARE RATES WHICH BY THE WAY IS ESTABLISHED BASED ON COST REPORTS AND SO FORTH -- YOU KNOW I I HAVE SOME SKEPTICISM ABOUT MEDICARE AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO HAVE THIS AMENDMENT. I HAD YOU KNOW SOME SKETCHES ABOUT USING THAT AS A BENCHMARK -- SO FORTH I'M NOT SURE IT'S A GOOD ONE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WE TRY TO WORK SOMETHING ELSE OUT. WE LAND WE STILL ENDED UP PLANNING THERE BUT TO HAVE THIS ARBITRATION MECHANISM BECAUSE WHAT I SAID IS THAT THAT THAT THAT THE CERTAINLY THE DIALYSIS COMPANIES. WHO ARE RIGHT THE DIALYSIS CENTERS DESERVE TO GET PAID? BE IT AMOUNT TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT CARE WE CAN'T HAVE THEM CLOSING UP GOING BANKRUPT NOT ABLE TO RUN -- BECAUSE IF THEY GO AWAY. BILL WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM RIGHT THEY WE NEED THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS CARE. THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S WHY SAID NOW WE HAVE TO PUT A MECHANISM THAT THEY CAN MAKE THEIR CASE AND AND DO THAT. AND WHILE SOME PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE WORKED OUT. I THINK AT LEAST WE TRIED TO TREAT THAT MECHANISM RIGHT WE ALSO TRIED TO PUT SOME MORE HELP AT SOME THAT AMENDMENTS TO TRY ADDRESS SELF DEALING I KNOW THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE A COALITION SUPPORTED A K. ATHENS -- CAME INTO MY OFFICE SAID YES WE WANT TO BE SURE WE TRY TO DEAL THE SELF DEALING PART. SO TRYING TO STRIKE THIS BALANCE IN BEING SURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE MR DOES MEAN HERE. IS ARE ARE GOING TO GET. THE CARE SHE NEEDS. AT THAT ALRIGHT AT DOWN TO THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS THAT WE BUT WE'RE IN A WAY THAT ALSO. DOESN'T CREE INOPPORTUNE FOR SOMEONE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE THIS AN SS CITY TO DO THIS. THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO CREATE A MECHANISM FOR WE CAN DRAW DOWN ON THE SINCE THE THE RISK FULL AND DIVERSE COOL SOUNDS LOW ADMINISTRATIVE ITSELF ABOUT IT REALLY MEANS DRISKELL MEANS. EVERYONE OF US WHO PAYS AND VICE THAT PRIVATE INSURANCE. OKAY THE OVERALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING HARD IN THEIR JOBS WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING ON STRIKE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR HEALTHCARE. ALL RIGHT AND THEIR SWALLOWING UP ALL THEIR WAGES ALL THE INCREASE BECAUSE THE COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY YOU KNOW TRYING TO BALANCE TO LABOR COSTS ARE SAYING. OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS GOING UP ETCETERA RIGHT AND SO THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN ISSUE WE'VE BEEN DEALING MORE BROADLY BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS HAVE A SITUATION WHICH AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ALICE IS I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE WE DON'T. WANT TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROVIDERS AND I'M A PROVIDER -- THAT WHERE BASICALLY PEOPLE CAN LEVERAGE THE RISK FOR BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GOING. TO BASICALLY DESTROYED INSURANCE MARKET IN THE END I MEAN IT'S IT'S GONNA BE MET ON WORKABLE RIGHT SO WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE CHERRY PICKING AND SO FORTH AND DRY AND AND DRIVING COSTS THAT WAY. ALRIGHT BUT WE NEED TO BE SURE THE INSURANCE IS THERE WHEN I NEED THEM AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BEEN STRUGGLING WITH RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT ELSE WE PUT PROTECTIONS IN THE ACA WE SAID. YOU CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE FOR PRE EXISTING CONDITION THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. RIGHT WE FOUGHT WE FOUGHT FUND THOUGHT BE SURE WE GOT THAT. RIGHT BUT THAT MEANS THAT INSURERS CAN'T SIT BACK AND GO YOU KNOW WHAT. SOMEONE'S HEAD NEEDS ALICE'S RIGHT HAND. TURNS OUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE CAN'T NEGOTIATE BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE BIG PLAYERS AND AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK WE CAN'T NEGOTIATE ADEQUATELY SO NOW WE HAVE THAT WE NOW WE HAVE. YOU KNOW THEIR SMALL NUMBER WE HAVE T&lt;c.cyan&gt; CONTRACTED RATE&lt;/c&gt; MISSILES IS OH WOW LOOK THAT'S A GREAT RATE. AND NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS BUT THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY ON THIS PRIVATE INSURANCE AND THEN THEY GO BE BUMPED OFF THE MEDICARE SO NOW WHATEVER THEIR CHANNEL THINGS AROUND. OKAY SO I REALIZE YOU'RE TO NOW IT'S INTERESTING YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S SITTING HERE WE HAVE BUT I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE BALLOTS WERE TRYING TO STRIKE HERE AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE WOODS WE HAVE. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I THINK WE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PINIONS ABOUT MOVIE SO WE WANT TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY SURE THE DIALYSIS COMPANIES WILL. GET A RUBIO REASONABLE REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENT -- ON AGAIN THIS IS AN ILL SMALL GROUP OF PATIENTS WHERE REALLY THE SITUATION IS IS THAT. THEY YOU KNOW. WHERE THERE'S THE SICKLY THERE ARE CERTAIN THAT MEAN THERE A WITH -- AT THE 280% YOUR DONORS YOU SHOULD KNOW YOUR TOES ARE ANYWAY -- AND THEN THERE 80% THE MARKET MARKET SHARE AND SO AND THEN THERE'S SENSUALLY. LEVERAGING THE POTENTIALLY LETTERING THE THE RISK FULL AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT A SITUATION THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE -- I MIGHT THINK SIMILAR WOULD FOR TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO TOGETHER -- AND TRYING TO CREATE SOME MECHANISMS TO PUT SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND THAT -- SO THAT -- WE STRIKE THAT BALANCE MAYBE IT'S NOT THE PERFECT BALANCE BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND I CERTAINLY HOPE. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW -- I WOULD URGE THE AND IT'S AND MUCH OF HIS YOU'RE SORT OF LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS -- BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY URGE -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE AN ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE WITH KIDNEY DISEASE AND END STAGE RENAL DISEASE AND SO I HOPE IN YOUR ADVOCACY -- YOU'LL RETHINK THIS DECISION ARE THIS IDEA OUT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE YOU'VE MADE HERE TO SAY I'M JUST GONNA PULL OUT OF CALIFORNIA OKAY THERE ARE PATIENTS LIKE MISTERDESMOND WHO ACTUALLY DON'T AFFECTED BY THE BILL -- THERE ARE OTHER THINGS YOU CAN ASK IN L. A. G. L. IT'S ARE A WE HAVE I THINK THAT THE I THINK YOU YOU HEARD OR SOMEBODY. TOURNEY'S THAT MAYBE JUST THAT'S THE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO AROUND THAT -- BUT YEAH BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO DRESS THIS OTHER PROBLEM AS WELL AND SO -- SO WITH THAT -- I'M CERTAINLY GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- SOME MEMBER WAS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DOCTOR PAN. WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY HERE -- BUT I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THE THE ISSUE THAT THAT THAT BROUGHT ME TO HEAR -- YOU HAVE COMPANIES. THAT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITABLE FOUNDATION. THAT WHEN I MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO A CHARITABLE FOUNDATION I DO THAT. I'LL TRADE STICKLEY I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING IN RETURN FROM THAT FOUNDATION. BUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE. IS IT THIS FOUNDATION. THROUGH THE GOOD WORK THIS IS NOT DISPARAGING THE FOUNDATION AT ALL AND I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT IN A MINUTE. BY THE PLAN. THAT ALLOWS THE DIALYSIS COMPANY TO CHARGE. THREE TO UP TO TEN TIMES POTENTIALLY IN OTHER AREAS. THE MEDICARE RATE. THERE FIVE THERE BY READING A HUGE WINDFALL [inaudible] NOW. TO THE IT THERE ARE GUARDRAILS A CAMP IS NOT KNOW WHO THE WHO WHO THE RECIPIENTS ARE -- OR WHERE THE FUNDING IS COMING FROM BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT EARLIER THIS IS A NUMBERS GAME. IT'S A PRETTY DARN GOOD CHANCE THAT FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION YOU'RE GOING TO REAP A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WINDFALL ON THE OTHER END. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF THAT. WHEN YOU CONTROL 82% OF THE MARKET? AND 92% OF THE REVENUE. THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. BY TWO COMPANIES. THE REASON WE HAVE THE SITUATION WE HAVE IS BECAUSE OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE MARKET. THERE USED TO BE A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER PROVIDERS BUT THE TWO PROVIDERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVE COME IN AND GOBBLED UP IN IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY SET UP SHOP NEXT DOOR TO A SMALLER. ONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSOLIDATION OF THE MARKET. NOW WE TALK ABOUT THE I. G. OPINION AND I WANT TO SAY. I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THE A. K. F.. ABSOLUTELY NOT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE A. K. F. THIS IS ABOUT A BEHAVIOR. THAT THE COMPANIES ARE USING TO REAP PROFITS. I RESPECT THE A CARE I'M HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY DO. I AM HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED THAT TODAY WE'RE HEARING THAT THEY WILL PULL OUT OF THE ENTIRE MARKET OF CALIFORNIA. EVEN THOUGH. MISTER DESMOND WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED AT ALL BY THIS BILL. WE'RE ALSO HEARING THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY WILLING TO SEND SOUND LIKE THEY WANT TO GO AND ASK FOR AND I G. OPINION. YOU WANT TO FIGHT FOR YOUR PATIENCE YOU WANT TO FIGHT TO HELP. KEEP PEACE PAY PAY PATIENTS ON THESE PROGRAMS YOU WANT TO PACK UP YOUR TENT AND GO GO AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. I FIND THAT VERY VERY DISTURBING A DISTURBING. WE HAVE SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA ON DIALYSIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED HERE. NOT A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. AND A K. F. AS WILLING TO JUST PACK IT UP AND LEAVE CALIFORNIA WITHOUT A FIGHT. THAT'S REALLY REALLY DISAPPOINTING. REALLY DISAPPOINTING. THIS IS ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT. IF WE CAN ADDRESS. WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A SCHEME? THAT IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. THAT IS SO EGREGIOUS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO KID OURSELVES WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET TO A POINT WE CAN COVER EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN EVER CONTAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS. LET'S QUIT KIDDING OURSELVES FOLKS IT WE CAN'T SUPPORT SOMETHING THE COP THAT CAN SCAN CONTAINS COSTS. BETTER SO EGREGIOUS. WHY WE EVEN BOTHERING TO TELL PEOPLE WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO THIS FOR GET COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE CALIFORNIANS WILL NEVER GET THERE? WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THERE. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT. LAST YEAR THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NO OPINION THERE WAS NO LEGAL OPINION THERE WAS NOTHING WHEN CENTER LEYVA HAD HER BILL. THERE WAS NO OPINION THERE. I HEAR TODAY THAT THE O. I. G.'S ACTUALLY SITS ON THEIR BOARD. IS THAT WHAT I HEARD WHAT I HEAR WHATEVER I HEARD SOME THERE WAS SOME RELATIONSHIP. THAT OR SOME SOME COPY GOOD COMMUNICATION BETWEEN -- IGN AND AND THAT'S THIS MY STATEMENT THANK YOU. I JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT -- THIS TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD OPINION IS SOMEHOW TREATED LIKE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT IS SOME HOW COMPLETELY INVIOLABLE. DO YOU THINK THE O. I. G. ENVISIONED THIS IS THE WAY THIS WILL PLAY OUT. THAT THE COMPANIES WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT. DO YOU THINK THE I. T. REALLY PLANNED THAT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT IF WE ASK FOR AN OPINION THEY MIGHT SAY THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING NOW IS BAD. DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. IS THAT WHY YOU'RE AFRAID TO ASK FOR THAT OPINION. THE DONORS 82% YOUR DONATE DE DENOMINATIONS COME FROM TWO SOURCES. IS HE IS HE A K. F. FREIGHT. THAT IF THEY DON'T PULL OUT OF CALIFORNIA THAT THE TWO BIG DONORS MIGHT NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THEM IS THAT POSSIBILITY. I DON'T KNOW. MY POINT IS IS THAT I'VE I'VE OTHERS AND I AND I WILL I WILL CLOSE HERE BUT WE WE WERE SAID WE HAVE A LEGAL OPINION SAYS YOU CAN'T DO THIS. SO WE GOT TO LEGAL OPINIONS. ARE LET'S COUNSEL AND OUTSIDE CORPORATE OPINION THAT SAID. THAT WOULD THEY COULD OPERATE. NOW TO THE CORPORATE THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY OR THE OR THE COOL COUNSEL FOR A K. F.. CHOSE TO CHERRY PICK A LINE. OUT OF THE BODY. OF THE OF THAT IGNORING THE CONCLUSION. HOW MANY OF YOU ON THE DíAS OF EVER BEEN INTERVIEWED? AND HAD SOMEBODY PICK ONE STATEMENT YOU MADE A MISS CHARACTERIZE WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO REPRESENT. THAT EVER HAPPENED ANYBODY ON THE DíAS. HAPPEN TO ME. A LOT. SADLY. BUT THAT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. SO I ASK YOU I AM THE I HAVEN'T. I HAVE A PROVIDER FOR CRYING OUT LOUD I'M THE LAST PERSON WHO IN THE WORLD WHO WANTS TO TAKE CARE WAY FOR PEOPLE. I WANNA GET CARE TO MORE PEOPLE. WE CANNOT DO IT. IF WE ALLOW. ALL SET SCHEMES LIKE THIS TO CONTINUE. WE'RE WE'RE VIOLATING OUR PROMISE TO CALIFORNIANS THAT THERE ARE COURTS SOME OF US A PLEDGE TO GET COVERS EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN'T LET THINGS LIKE THIS CONTINUE. I HOPE A CAREFREE CONSIDERS. DOESN'T ABANDON ACTUALLY GOES UP TO FIGHT FOR THEIR PATIENTS. HOPE THEY DO THAT. I DIDN'T HEAR THAT TODAY JUST ALL I HEARD WAS ONE OF BACK APART TEN GO HOME. THAT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING -- SPECIALLY WHEN. MR DEVIN WOULDN'T BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL AT ALL THERE WAS NO JUSTIFICATION BY ANYBODY AS TO WHY THEY WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE MISTER DESMOND OUT OF THIS. THE NOW WOULD STILL INSTEAD I DO THEY SAID THEY JUST PULLED UP EVERYBODY. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED. SO AS YOU VOTE TODAY I THINK ABOUT THIS THING ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO CONTAIN THE CASA HEALTH CARE I WHICH IS ALREADY GOING TO DOUBLE THE RATE OF INFLATION CALIFORNIA. HOW DO WE EVER GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL HAD WE EVER DO THAT WE CANNOT? DO SOMETHING SO EGREGIOUS. THAT ALLOWS FOR HUGE PROFITS. FOR A CHARITABLE DONATION. BUT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL.

OKAY I WITNESSES SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATORS MARKETS GOT THROWN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE THE HEALTH NETWORK -- RECENTLY SOME OF OUR PARTNERS UNDERTOOK A PROJECT -- IN WHICH THEY HAD NATIVE SPEAKERS FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES -- REVIEW CERTAIN TRANSLATE MATERIALS INCLUDING THE DRUG MEDI CAL MENTAL HANDBOOKS IN VARIOUS NOTICES. ON SOME OF THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVE FROM FROM OUR PARTNERS -- DETAILED WHY A MORE THOROUGH READABILITY PROCESS IS NEEDED -- FOR EXAMPLE PARTNERS THAT REVIEWED MATERIALS TRANSLATE INTO CAMBODIAN STATED THAT THEY FOUND BOOKLETS HARD TO READ AND UNDERSTAND. THEY ENDED UP -- GOING THROUGH THEM LINE BY LINE TO REACH TRANSLATE THEM INTO SIMPLIFIED LANGUAGE ESTATE IT ENDED UP BECOMING JUST A TRANSLATION PROJECT AS OPPOSED TO A REVIEW BECAUSE THE TRANSLATED MATERIAL DIDN'T MAKE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY -- THIS BILL SEEKS TO SOLVE THE ISSUE OF DOCKING READABILITY THROUGH A MORE DETAILED PROCESS THAN WHAT'S ALREADY IN PRACTICE BY REQUIRING FIELD TESTING OF DOCUMENTS. THAT MANY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS RELY ON TO INFORM THEM OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM MEDI CAL PROGRAM FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB THREE EIGHTEEN THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIVAL. GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLER ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- AND WITH REGARDS THE FIELD TESTING THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES I JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT FIELD TESTING ISN'T YOU KNOW SENDING THE MATERIALS OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND IN THIS CASE LET IT LIKE THEY HAD TO DO IS. REVISE AND REDO EVERYTHING BUT REALLY JUST REPORTING BACK IF THEY UNDERSTAND IT TOO MANY TIMES PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND ACRONYMS HAD BEEN TRANSLATED THINGS ARE TOO FORMAL -- OR SOMETIMES THE TRANSLATIONS JUST LITERAL -- AND THEN IN ADDITION THE OTHER PART OF THIS BILL WE ALSO GOT A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSLATION IS THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH DOCUMENT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. I'VE SEEN MEDI CAL DOCUMENTS AIMED AT BENEFICIARIES THE I MYSELF STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND SO THAT'S WHY WE DO HAVE THIS READABILITY WORKGROUP WHERE WE'D BE REVIEWING THE TEN MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS. SENDING HIM TO AN OUTSIDE SOURCE AND ACTUALLY GETTING SOME EXPERTISE ON HOW TO MAKE MEDI CAL INFORMATION MORE UNDERSTANDABLE. THANK YOU. THE BILL RATE THAT OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT.

AND THE STAFF AND SPONSORS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS WE HAVE TALKED A LOT AND WE TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF THIS IS. A MEDICAL INFORMATION THAT NEEDS TO BE IN HERE DUE TO OUR SORT OF THE CONTENT BEING REQUIRED BY DH CS THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE LOCALLY IS CAN IT CAN AND IS CONFUSING. WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP WE THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA AND WE SUPPORT THAT OUR CONCERNS LIE AROUND THE FIELD TESTING WE DO FEEL TESTING NOW WE THINK THE DEFINITION IS BROADER IN THE BILL. AND WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT GOING THROUGH A LOT OF WORK AND NOT GETTING MUCH BACK WE WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ON THIS. AND HOPE TO GET SOMEWHERE ON THIS SO THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER ALI WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS -- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS -- WITH US ON THIS BILL IT HAS IMPROVED SINCE IT WAS INTRODUCED -- BUT WE DO REMAIN -- YOU KNOW HAVING SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- WE'VE PROVIDED AMENDMENTS TO THE SPONSORS UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF OUR AMENDMENTS WERE ADOPTED BY THEM ON THE KEY ISSUE THAT WE'VE JUST KIND OF AGREED -- GOTTEN STUCK ON IS THE USE OF THE NADER NATIVE SPEAKERS PART OF THE FIELD TESTING. I'M AS MISS MOSSBERG STATE WE CURRENTLY DO DO FEEL TESTING BUT WE HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS WITH THE USE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER -- WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW THAT PERSON IS ACTUALLY QUALIFIED TO REVIEW WRITTEN MATERIALS AND MAKE THE BEST JUDGMENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE TRANSLATED MATERIALS BECAUSE WHEN WE USE PROFESSIONAL TRANSLATORS WE KNOW -- THEIR CERTIFICATION THEIR EDUCATION THEIR THEIR READING LEVELS AND SO THAT REMAINS THE BASIS FOR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. OKAY SEEN A QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TING UNDISTURBED MOTION ON THE BILL THAT'S RIGHT CENTER. MAKE A COMMENT. THANK YOU I SHOULD SAY WHY I THINK THIS IS JUST -- BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I YOU KNOW I WAS A TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AT A SCHOOL AND WE HAVE PROFESSIONAL TRANSLATORS AND THAT THE AND I ENDED UP JUST TAKING OVER AND BE THE TRANSLATOR BECAUSE FRIENDS HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE PAPERS WERE SAYING THERE IS COMPLETELY A DIFFERENT. WAY OUR PROFESSIONAL SPEAK AS OPPOSED HER ACTUAL FAMILIES AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS A DISCONNECTED EVEN THAT WASN'T A PROFESSIONAL TRANSLATOR I BECAME THE OFFICIAL TRANSIT JUST HIT -- MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE. TO TWO OR THE REGION SO SO THAT'S WHY I THINK I IT'S IMPORTANT SO WITH THE BATTERY THANK YOU AND SEVEN DEVICE AND RUBIO I'D SO I SEE -- REVIEW I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. I THINK TO TRULY MEET THE INTENT OF THE BILL ANDERSON AND THE ISSUE AROUND SAYING WELL WHAT DOES A NATIVE SPEAKER MAIN BUT IT REALLY HAS TO BE SOMEONE. WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT ESSENTIALLY WHAT HOW THE LANGUAGE IS SEEN IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT OTHERWISE WE WE ACTUALLY SAW A PROBLEM -- THIS YEAR -- AND THIS INVOLVED ASIAN LANGUAGE HEBREW WENT ACTUALLY DURING THE MEASLES OUTBREAK IN NEW YORK THEY PUT OUT THESE IN HEBREW AND SOMEONE DIDN'T REALLY READ AT THE OF WELL AS FROM THE COMMUNITY STANDPOINT IT DIDN'T SAY WHAT THEY WANTED TO SAY AND THAT'S A PROBLEM RATE. I KNOW THAT CERTAINLY -- ACTUALLY CERTAIN DEGREE MAYBE WE SHOULD ALSO DO THIS THE ENGLISH BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE HAVE THINGS IN LANGUAGE DOWN AND THAT ARE IN ENGLISH THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE TO MOST LAY PEOPLE AS WELL -- BUT CERTAINLY -- I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSLATIONS -- NO BAD TRANSLATIONS MEAN LEAD TO MISINFORMATION AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT -- THAT -- WE TRADED I I'D WANTED CHIEF WHAT THE SIMILAR CHIU STRAIN TO ACHIEVE SO I RECOGNIZE AND SO WHAT YOU TO WORK ON THAT. BUT IT REALLY DOES MEAN SOMEBODY BEYOND JUST HAVING A PERSONAL CERTIFICATION SOMEONE WHO TRULY UNDERSTANDS HOW THE LANGUAGE IS RED AND PRETTY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT. TRANSLATION I SHE'S ALWAYS SAY WE HAVE INTERPRETERS WHO WORK WITH ME BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO KNOW THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WERE SO A LITTLE TRANSLATION MAY NOT CONVEY. THE SAME THING THAT THE THING THAT YOU THINK IT DOES AND SO WITH THAT -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

I'LL START BY CLARIFYING THAT I'M PROPOSING AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS TO CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AND ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION. AB SEVEN FOUR FOUR STRING THINGS NONDISCRIMINATION STATUTES IN EXISTING TELEHEALTH LAW TO ENSURE THAT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IS REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES DELIVERED TO AN ENROLLEE. TO TELEHEALTH WHEN THOSE SAME SERVICES ARE COVERED IN PERSON. ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE REAL REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOCATION AND PROVIDER SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZE TO EXPAND THE REACH. THIS BILL DOES NOT EXPAND ANY SERVICES THAT ARE COVERED IT ONLY ADDRESSES THE MODALITY USED TO PROVIDE THOSE COVERED SERVICES. WHETHER PROVIDERS SEES A PATIENT PERSON OR THROUGH A VIDEO CONFERENCE THEY SHOULD BE PAID FOR THAT WORK THIS WILL ENSURE THERE'S ACCESS IN THE MARKET. AB SEVEN FOUR FOUR WILL PARTICULARLY HELP CALIFORNIANS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS AND THOSE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR HOWEVER THAT THIS IS NOT A RURAL ISSUE WE HAVE POCKETS IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS WHERE ACCESS IS LIMITED AND WE SHOULD BE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO THE LEVERAGE INNOVATION IN HEALTH CARE. TO SERVE THESE POPULATIONS. I'M GOING TO PASS IT OFF TO MY SUPPORTERS NO GOOD SPEAK TO THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH TELE HEALTH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. I THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AMY DRIVER NOT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SPONSORS OF THE BELL -- EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY FOUR IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD IMPROVING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE ACROSS CALIFORNIA BY ENSURING THAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE OUT OF COOLEY. REIMBURSED FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES ESSENTIALLY IT DESPITE EXISTING ON TRYING TO ENSURE THE HEALTH PLANS CAN'T TREAT SERVICES DIFFERENTLY JUST BECAUSE ARE PROVIDED THROUGH TELEHEALTH -- THE PLANS ARE STILL ABLE TO DO SO FOR INSTANCE BY CONTRACTING WITH THIRD PARTY CORPORATIONS AS THEIR SOLE TELEHEALTH PROVIDER OR LIVING COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN TELEHEALTH-MODALITIES THAT INHIBITS CONTINUITY OF CARE FRAGMENTS THE SYSTEM AND COST PATIENTS MORE. WHILE DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT TELEHEALTH IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT CAN INCREASE ACCESS TO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARE. AND SERVICES THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THOSE PROVIDED IN AN OFFICE OFTEN SELLING OF FACILITY HERE AND WITH EVEN MORE COSTLY EQUIPMENT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THESE LIMITED IN VARYING INSURANCE COVERAGE RULES ON TELEHEALTH REDUCE UTILIZATION AND INVESTMENT IN ITS USE WHICH THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS BY ENSURING TAUGHT TRUE TEL HELP PARITY. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. MEKONG IS A THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR CONNECTED HEALTH POLICY WHICH THE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED NATIONAL TELL HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH CENTER. I'M NOT HERE IN THERE EITHER IN SUPPORT OR AGAINST THE BILL I'M HERE IN THE TECHNICAL CAPACITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ANY. ANSWERS TO POLICY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ASKED YOU SEE H. P.

CALIFORNIA HAS SLIPPED A LITTLE BIT BEHIND IN THE PROGRESSIVENESS OF THE LOSS RELATED TO TELL HOW POLICY REIMBURSEMENT. OF RIGHT NOW WITH THE BILL WITH AB SEVEN FOUR FOUR IT WILL PUT CALIFORNIA FURTHER AHEAD AND MORE IN KEEPING A PIECE WITH THE COUNTRY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF INTERESTING ITEMS WITH IN THE BILL THAT MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE PROGRESSIVE. SUCH AS ENSURING THAT -- NOT ONLY OUR THIRD PARTY VENDORS ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGH THE HEALTH PLANS BUT ALSO IN NETWORK PROVIDERS AS WELL.

PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE -- A HIT FROM A NATIONAL LEVEL IT'S BEEN COMMITTED TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO TELL HEALTH SERVICES AND THERE'S BEEN. A LOT OF ACTIVITY WITH CMS ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL AS WELL -- I THINK WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS AS ACT CLICK AS FAR AS OUR ABILITY -- TO NEGOTIATING CONTRACTS AND SHIFT NEAR OF WE HAVE SOME PROVIDERS THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LARGER INFLUX OF PATIENTS AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE WE WANT THAT ABILITY TO TO DO THOSE CON. THOSE CONTRACTS COMPETITIVELY -- AND SO I THINK. WE'RE HERE CONTINUING OPPOSITION BUT HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AND SEPARATE THOSE NEXT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JENNIFER ALLEY WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS THANK YOU THANK YOU.

OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS REMEMBERS MOTION. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GONZALEZ -- SO THE SUMMER AGUIAR-CURRY OF ITS APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD. A A CERTAINLY HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT NEGOTIATED RATES I THINK IF YOU'RE PROVIDING THE EXACT SAME SERVICE. I THINK WITH. BAG TO ARGUE WHY IS IT THAT YOU WOULD PAY A DIFFERENT RATE OR IS IT COULD BE HIGHER LESS OR SO FORTH. ONE IT WOULD MAKE NOTE Y. SE THE SAME EXACT SAME SERVICE I UNDERSTAND THAT'S WEIRD AND APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS -- MILLIE FOR EXAMPLE -- IN M. CODES WELL IF YOU HAVE THE A VITAL SIGNS THEN PROBABLY THE PERSON'S NOT FRONT OF YOU YOU'RE NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT OVER SO. BUT IT IS EXACTLY THE EXACT SAME SERVICE YOU'RE GETTING PROVIDING THE THE I DOING THIS THE EXAM YOU'RE MEETING ALL THE CRITERIA. IT DOES TO ME BAG BIT QUESTION THAT WHY YOU WOULD PAY DIFFERENTLY -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE WELL IF YOU'RE SO ANYWAY HI SO I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA KEEP WORKING ON IT. I I THINK THAT A LOT OF THINGS THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFERENCES PRIDE BECAUSE YOU KNOW OVER WIRES TO ADDRESS IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT SO I WOULD SAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE. YOU PRIVATE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE CODING IN EM ON LEVEL THREE FOR H. PHONE CONSULTAR K. BECAUSE YOU JUST CAN'T DO ALL THE THINGS OVER A TELEPHONE CALL I MEAN JUST WOULD NOT. EVER MATCH THAT AS A SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY YELL TAKES PHONE CALLS AS A PEDIATRICIAN AND AND SEES PATIENTS IN CLINIC AND SO FORTH SO I SO I THINK SOME OF THE ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL DO. A YEAH WELL I SHOULD SAY IN THIS PLACE -- BUT I THINK PERHAPS ON WHAT WE REALLY DID SAY IS THAT IF IT'S THE EXACT SAME SERVICE THEN YOU SHOULD GET THE PAY THAT DELEGATE THE RATE AND WE SHOULD BE NEGOTIATING THAT WAY AND THAT IN FACT. WOULD LIKE CHURCH TELEHEALTH THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE EXACT SAME SERVICE WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST TELEHEALTH. SO -- THAT AND AND THAT WAY SO. THE US SO ANYWAY I APPRECIATE CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER I I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF NATURAL CONSTRAINTS ON THIS BILL ALREADY JUST BECAUSE OF ITS IT IS THE EXACT SAME SERVICE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN'T DO OVER TELEHEALTH THAT WERE. REALLY DOES BUNDLED IN TOGETHER WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED RATE NOT FOR THE ENTIRE SERVICE BUT FOR A SUBSET AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT AGO SHE ASIAN. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT POINT -- AND APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THIS BILL AND SO IT'S AS WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES I'M SURE I'D LIKE TO JUST THINK WE'RE I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STATE BECAUSE PEOPLE OF THAT HAVE CONCERNS -- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS THE RATE SETTING BILL I MUST ADMIT. MY MINISTER THEY WERE TO JUST TO CLARIFY THE HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER AND HELP NEGOTIATE IF THEY NEED TO DO SO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA OKAY THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT A GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN I STARTED THIS MY NAME IS THE ISRAEL BE ON WITH ME BY MORE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP FOR PUBLIC ADVANCEMENT ALSO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA LINE FOR YOU THANK COMMUNITY JUSTICE. I GREW UP IN THE SALINAS CALIFORNIA OFTEN. ALL WE HAD WAS A SUPPORT WE PROVIDED EACH OTHER THE COMMUNITY CONDITIONS POVERTY VIOLENCE AND THE DESPAIR THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT WAS OVERWHELMING FOR ME AS A CHILD. AT AN EARLY AGE I SUCCUMB TO THE PRESSURES OF VIOLENCE AS A RESULT I WAS INCARCERATED ON AN OFFER EIGHTEEN OF MY FORTY ONE YEARS. THERE WAS ALWAYS A WELL RESOURCE AND ACROSS AND COORDINATED APPROACH TO MY PUNISHMENT AND INCARCERATION BUT NEVER FOR HEALING AND PREVENTION. IMAGINE IF DECK DECADES AGO CALIFORNIA HAD INVESTED IN A COORDINATED APPROACH THAT FOCUSED ON PREVENTING VIOLENCE HEALING UNDERLYING TRAUMA AND SUPPORT OF INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE CAUSING HARM. THAT WAS NOT THE DECISION CALIFORNIA MADE BACK THEN BUT IT IS DECISION WE CAN MAKE TODAY. TO MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE A MULTI GENERATIONAL VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA I LEARNED THAT THE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE CAN BE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS TO COMMUNITY BASED PREVENTIONS. AT ME BUT WE WORK WITH YOUTH AND ADULTS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE EXPOSED TO VIOLENCE AND SOME WITH COST HARM. AND WE USE CULTURAL CULTURALLY ROOTED PRACTICES TO FOSTER HEALING AND INVEST IN THEIR LEADERSHIP AND STRENGTH. THIS APPROACH IS WORKING IN SALINAS IT'S ALSO WORKING IN RICHMOND WERE HOMICIDES DOWN BY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. IT'S WORK IN ALL THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY VIOLENCE HAVE STEPPED UP TO BUILD SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS. WE KNOW HOW TO BUILD REAL SAFETY WE'RE DOING IT EVERY DAY BUT THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT CORRELATED ACROSS THE STATE AND THEY'RE NOT PROPERLY FUNDED. WITHOUT A STATEWIDE PLAN IN A HOME FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION HEALING OUR EFFORTS ARE LIMITED AND ISOLATED. AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO BILL TOGETHER AND COORDINATE FOR FOR FOR EVEN GREATER IMPACT. CALIFORNIA NEEDS AN OFFICE ABOUT THE STATE COMMUNITIES BY HAVING A DEDICATED OFFICE WE CAN BRING TOGETHER PEOPLE PRACTICES AND RESOURCES UNDER ONE ROOF AND FIND GREAT THE STATEWIDE PLAN. AMBITION THAT WILL ALLOW HEALTH AND SAFETY TO FLOURISH. ALL IN WITH THE CALL FROM OUR NEW SURGEON GENERAL THE ATTRITION DR NINETEEN BURKE HARRIS WHO STATES UNLESS YOU FIX THE TRAUMA THE WHOLE IN THE SOUL WHERE THE WOUND STARTED YOU'RE WORKING.

OKAY ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE INDICATION IS YOU HAVE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE EAGR TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL SO -- WITH THAT SO. YOUR PRESENTATION THAT I THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO WANT HEALTH [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GONNA SHARE THE FINDINGS FROM OUR STUDY ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT IN OLDER ADULTS SPONSORED BY THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT ASSESSED HOW WELL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SPONSORED BY THE MHSAA OR SERVING OLDER ADULTS. WHICH ARE DEFINED AS PEOPLE SIXTY AND OVER WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEEDS AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE. FEW PROGRAMS ARE OUT REACH EFFORTS WERE TAILORED TO THE COMPLEX CARE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS. OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT AND DATA WERE QUITE LIMITED AND WE IDENTIFIED ISOLATED PROGRAMS OPERATING AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. WE ALSO NOTED THAT THERE IS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE FOR OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH. SO BASED ON THESE FINDINGS WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING TO ESTABLISH A FULL TIME ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP POSITION AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WOULD BE DEDICATED TO ADULT. OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITH THE PROPER AUTHORITY THIS LEADERSHIP POSITION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO AN OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE POLICIES TO IMPROVE SERVICES. PROVIDE NEEDED OVERSIGHT ESTABLISH STANDARDIZED DATA REPORTING. GUIDE COUNTY EFFORTS TO ENHANCE OLDER ADULT OUTREACH AND DOCUMENTATION OF UNMET NEED. PROMOTE STANDARDIZED GERIATRIC TRAINING AN INCREASE SERVICE -- INTEGRATION EFFORTS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME RECENTLY ISSUED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR MASTER PLAN ON AGING AND WE APPLAUD THIS EFFORT. HOWEVER THE NEED FOR THIS POSITION AS A MEDIA AND CRITICAL AND SHOULD NOT BE TABLE DURING THAT PLANNING PROCESS. OUR FINDINGS WERE SUPPORTED AND FURTHER QUANTIFIED BY THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DATA BOOK IN REPORT RECENTLY ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL. IN CLOSING I LEAVE YOU WITH A FEW IMPORTANT NUMBERS. USING A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF ABOUT 10% OF PREVALENCE RATE FOR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OLDER CALIFORNIANS WITH THESE NEEDS. YET. TWENTY SIX THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS RECEIVED BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR THIS REPRESENTED 4%. OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED AND ABOUT 4%. OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS IN NEED OF THESE SERVICES. OLDER ADULTS ARE 16% OF THE ADULT MEDICAL POPULATION AND YET LESS THAN 2% RECEIVED EVEN. ONE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND FINALLY IN A FORTY FIVE COUNTY STUDY DATA SHOWED THAT ONLY ONE POINT 5%. OF OLDER ADULTS RECEIVED ANY PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES SPONSORED BY THE MHSAA. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE SITUATION IS DIRE AND REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND RIGHT NOW NO ONE HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM. MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN I WOULD MENTION THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A VOTE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SECOND DAY OR SOME OTHER ISSUES I DO WANT TO HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY BUT IF YOU KEEP A BRIEF THAT BE APPRECIATED. SEE WHAT I CAN THANK YOU SENATOR PENN IN MEMBERS CAROL SO FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOR EIGHTY WE BELIEVE THAT ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE DEDICATED TO OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH WILL DO ADDRESS A CLEAR NEED FOR THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE HAD HEALTH CARE FOR THIS POPULATION. I'M YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULT POPULATION IS GROWING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE WHAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD IS THAT OVER 20% OF OUR OLDER ADULTS LIVE AT OR NEAR POVERTY. OVER 40% HAVE INSUFFICIENT INCOMES TO MEET THEIR MONTHLY EXPENSES -- LIVING LONGER MEANS THAT THEY LIVE LONGER WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS OFTEN ENDING IN DISABILITY AND ISOLATION. THESE FACTORS ALONE ARE CAUSE FOR ANXIETY AND DISTRESS AT ANY AGE. ADD TO THIS THE REALITY THAT OLDER ADULTS WITH THE ONLY AGE GROUP THAT IS CERTAIN TO FACE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING. LOSS OF CAREER FAILING HEALTH THE DEATH OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY OR LOVED ONES ECONOMIC AND SECURITY VULNERABILITY TO EXPLOITATION. THESE FACTORS PLACE THEM AT SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR DEPRESSION ANXIETY PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND SUICIDE. IN FACT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BETWEEN 7290% OF ADULTS OVER. SIXTY FIVE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO AT LEAST ONE POTENTIALLY TRAUMATIC EVENT DURING THEIR LIFE. COUNTED AMONG THIS GROUP ARE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS KOREAN WAR VIETNAM WAR IRAQI WAR VICTIMS -- VETERANS OF SURVIVORS OF JIM CROW DISCRIMINATION ELDER JEEP OF THE ELDERLY REFUGEES AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ELDER ABUSE SURVIVORS. LGBT CUES ADULTS ALSO SERVED AS A PROMOTION IT LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION VICTIMISATION. FILED FOLLOWING A LIFETIME OF BEING OSTRACIZED BY FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH MASTER PLAN OUTLINES AN OLDER ADULT SYSTEM OF CARE. BUT THAT SYSTEM EXISTS ONLY ON PAPER. CURRENT LAW THAT ADDRESSES ADULT AN OLDER ADULT PROGRAMS TOGETHER THIS APPROACH FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE CLEAR DIFFERENCES THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE TWO AGE GROUPS. AB FORTY BRINGS A DIRECT FOCUS ON THE GERIATRIC AND SOCIOLOGICAL ISSUES REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. ESTABLISHMENT ESTABLISHING THIS NEW POSITION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CREATES THE OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE NECESSARY. TO DEVELOP IT -- AND EFFECTIVE OLDER ADULTS SYSTEM OF CARE WE ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ADRIN SULTAN WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS GOT THE MOST FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALEX SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SEEN OTHER WITNESS WITH THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. A SINGLE WITNESS OPPOSITION QUESTIONS ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEIR MOTION MILK OKAY TO MOTION BY CENTER. MINING. SEVERAL GARCIA ALSO MEMBER SALAS EXTENDED AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'VE DONE RESPECTFULLY ASK DR ALL OKAY THANK YOU I WILL. I THINK ASSEMBLY EVER SALAS SHOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU SAID STAND IN FOR HIM THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO THEM IT'S BEEN SECONDED THE MOTION TO PASS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AND I AND I STONE. STONE I AM GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I GROWTH HER TADO LABOR LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING. MONNING AYE RUBIO. AT THE HEAD SIX VOTES AT SIX ZERO RIGHT NOW WILL HOLD THE BILL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS ALL RIGHT CENTER KALRA. WELCOME. WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER NINE AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE THE CORD. I NEED TO BRING THAT AND WITH THAT. RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SURE MEMBERS OF ONE OF THE START UP IS NOW WILL BE ACCEPTING A AMENDMENTS IS OUTLINED THE MOCK UP TO ADDRESS. POLICY COMMON STATED IN THE ANALYSIS -- SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY ONE EXPANDS THE RATE REVIEW PROCESS TO THE LARGE GROUP MARKET AND ENHANCES THE PROCESS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS AND REGULATORS A CLEAR PICTURE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. TRANSPARENCY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT CONTAINING COSTS AND AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE HAS BROAD SUPPORT CONSUMER GROUPS LABOR AND EMPLOYERS WHO STAND TO BENEFIT. FROM PAYING LOWER COSTS FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE. IN CALIFORNIA PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYER HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS A RISEN TWO HUNDRED AND 49% SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO MORE THAN SIX TIMES. THE INCREASE IN THE STATE'S OVERALL INFLATION THE SKYROCKETING COST OF HEALTHCARE IS CONTRIBUTING TO WASTE OUR NATION. AND FUELING INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE STATE BECAUSE WHAT WE PUT INTO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ULTIMATELY COMPLETE COMPETES WITH WAGE INCREASES AND HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS. WE ADDRESS WORKLOAD CONCERNS BY REQUIRING TEAMMATES SEE AS CITY I THE ONLY RATE REVIEW THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR LARGE GROUPS EXPERIENCE RATED PLANS TO DETERMINE IF. THE BASE RATE ON THE METHODOLOGY USE ARE UNREASONABLE OR UNJUSTIFIED. ADDITIONALLY PURCHASERS A LARGE GROUP EXPERIENCE RATED PLANS WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO REQUEST FOR FULL RATE REVIEW SHOULD THE RATE INCREASE MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA. CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A ROBUST RATE REVIEW FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND IT SAVED INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ALREADY SINCE THE LAW WAS ENACTED. IMPROVING AND BUILDING UPON RATE REVIEW WILL ALLOW GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND SCRUTINY ON WHAT IS DRIVING RISING PREMIUMS OF A GOES INTO REYES. BECAUSE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS GAIN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO THE LARGE GROUP MARKET THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THIS BILL HAS TO COMBAT RIGHT TO COMBAT RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND PROVIDE RELIEF TO CONSUMERS NEGATES THOSE COSTS BY HEALTH PLANS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FILE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. TO A COMPLY. AND GOOD TO MAKE IT CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING IN AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE THAT PREVENTS A LARGE EMPLOYER FROM NEGOTIATING WITH THE HEALTH PLAN TO TAILOR BENEFITS THE NEEDS OF THAT EMPLOYER. AND THEIR EMPLOYEES AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE SIMPLY REQUIRES STATE REGULATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE USING METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE REASONABLE AND JUSTIFIED. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA SAVE ALMOST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE A RATE REVIEW WHY SHOULDN'T EMPLOYERS WITH TWO HUNDRED OR TWO THOUSAND PLAYERS GET THE SAME SERVICE FROM THEIR STATE. THE COST OF RATE REVIEW AND INDEED ALL THE LICENSING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH PLANS ARE TINY THE ENTIRE BUDGET FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. AMOUNTS TO LESS THAN POINT 005% OF PREMIUMS. EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IS THE D. M. A. H. C. BUDGET OUT OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR BILLION IN PREMIUMS READ REVIEWS ONLY A FRACTION OF THAT. EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET TO THE NEW COST RATE REVIEW UNDER EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS TINY AND REALLY IS THE RATE PAYERS IT IS THE PLEASE THE LARGE EMPLOYERS. THAT STAND TO REALLY SAY BILLIONS OVER THE YEARS AHEAD IF WE DO HAVE A ROBUST RATE REVIEW PROCESS -- BUT WITH ME TO TESTIMONY AS BETH CAPELL REPRESENTING HEALTH ACCESS UNITE HEARING TEAMSTERS ANSWER FOX IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION START FAST RELIABLE. OKAY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HOW MANY PEOPLE TESTIFYING YOU KNOW YOU GET SIX MINUTES SORRY YEAH -- GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS YES MENTALITY ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION AND CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE ONE OF THE REASONS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS BEEN SUCH A SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE HAVE. ASKED OURSELVES HOW CAN WE IMPROVE ON THE ACA AND DO EVEN MORE TO MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE OF WHAT AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN CALIFORNIA WENT BEYOND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACA AND REQUIRED RATE REVIEW FOR EVERY PRODUCT IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL EMPLOYER MARKET. RATE REVIEW IS WORKING AND CALIFORNIA AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM MISTER KALRA SINCE WE STARTED REVIEWING RATES FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS SMALL BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS HAVE pDOLLARS. HOWEVER THERE ARE TEN MILLION PEOPLE IN THE LARGE EMPLOYER MARKET WHO DO NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF PROTECTION WHEN IT COMES TO RATE REVIEW. HEALTH INSURANCE HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET HAVE BEEN RISING STEADILY WITH NO REVIEW FOR REGULATORS TO ENSURE THAT INCREASES ARE REASONABLE AND JUSTIFIED. AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA SAID EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE WAS AMENDED TO ADDRESS WORKLOAD CONCERNS FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. ABOUT THE COST OF RATE REVIEW AS MR CALLER SAID. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INSURERS BROUGHT IN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUMS FOR COMMERCIAL COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA THE BUDGET FOR D. MHC IS EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND RATE REVIEW IS ONLY A FRACTION OF THAT BUDGET. AND THE ADDITIONAL RATE REVIEW THAT WE WOULD ADD ON TOP WOULD BE A MODEST ADDITION TO THAT. AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE BUILT ON PROVEN SUCCESS AND COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE LARGE BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY APPLYING RATE REVIEW TO THE LARGE GROUP MARKET FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARIO YOU DID HEAR FROM UNITED HERE REPRESENTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF A HOTEL ROOM CLEANERS. CASINO BARTENDERS AND CAFETERIA COOKS WHO ALONG WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. HEALTH CARE THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS -- WORKERS AND UNITE HERE ARE FIGHTING TO GET IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND ALONG WITH HEALTH ACCESS THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION TEAMSTERS AND AS HE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA. HEALTH CARE. IS A BARRIER THAT'S WHY WE'RE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL IT'S A LABOR MANAGEMENT BILL THAT THE GROCERS INTO TROUBLE BECAUSE SENIORS SUPPORT AS WELL. LAST FALL EIGHT THOUSAND MERRY OUT WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE. BECAUSE ONE JOB SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY WHEN YOU WORK FOR THE WEALTHIEST HOTEL COMPANY IN THE WORLD. IN SAN FRANCISCO WORKERS WERE ON THE PICKET LINE FOR SIXTY ONE DAYS. HEALTH CARE WAS A DECISIVE REASON IN THE LENGTH OF THAT STRIKE. AIRLINE CATERING WORKERS IN TWENTY EIGHT CITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO HAVE JUST VOTED TO STRIKE IF RELEASED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IS A KEY REASON WHY THOUSANDS OF UNITE HERE MEMBERS JUST VOTED YES HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE CASINO WAS PAYING NORTH OF TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR HEALTH CARE ELSEWHERE HOTELS PAY MORE THAN. THIRTEEN EACH YEAR INSURERS TELLER EMPLOYERS. WE MUST PAY MORE TO KEEP THE SAME BENEFITS THAT OUR PLAYERS TURN AROUND AND SAY THAT DESPITE INCREASING COSTS AND FOOD TRANSPORTATION HOUSING NOT TO MENTION RECORD PROFITS IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. THEY'RE JUST AS A MONEY FOR RAISES OF COURSE HOSPITALITY WORKERS AREN'T ALONE IN THIS AS MISS BELL IS SAID TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS GET HEALTHCARE IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET. CALIFORNIA IS LUCKY TO HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO THAT MARKET THANKS TO SENATOR LENO'S SB FIVE FORTY SIX FROMTWENTY FIFTEEN THE PAST THREE YEARS UNITE HERE SCRIPT HAS SCRUTINIZED THE DATA PROVIDED UNDER THAT LAW. AND WE'VE SEEN THE SAME TRENDS. PREMIUMS KEEP GOING UP FASTER THAN INFLATION AND ITS PRICE INCREASES NOT UTILIZATION DRIVING THOSE COST INCREASES THE OPPOSITION. SAYS HEALTH INSURERS ALREADY REPORT KOBE IS INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR RATES THAT AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE WOULD CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL BURDENS WE SUBMIT THAT THE REAL REASON BEHIND THEIR OPPOSITION IS A DESIRE TO AVOID. ANY KIND OF OVERSIGHT OF THEIR PRICING POWER WHICH CONTRARY TO THEIR CLAIM THAT RATE REVIEW -- IN THE SMALL AN INDIVIDUAL GROUP MARKETS HAS NOT BEEN USED TO LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS HAS ALREADY SAVED US HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE. THE OPPOSITION TO SEARCH AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS AN UNNECESSARY INTERVENTION IN NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN AND I QUOTE SOPHISTICATED MARKET ACTORS WE AGREE. THAT UNION TRUST FUNDS ARE FUNDS ARE AMONG THE MOST SOPHISTICATED PURCHASERS. BUT THAT MISSES THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT ASK YOURSELF IF YOU'RE BUYING HEALTHCARE FOR TWO HUNDRED OR EVEN TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. HOW MUCH BARGAINING POWER DO YOU HAVE COMPARED WITH AN INSURER WITH EIGHT MILLION COVERED LIVES? HIGHER DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. HERE MARIN ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA GROUP ASSOCIATION -- HAPPY -- TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE ALONG WITH OUR FRIENDS IN LABOR -- THE GROCER GROCERS ARE ARE ONE OF THE OF THE CROSS INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH LABOR -- AT THIS AT ISSUE ACTUALLY THE ISSUE OF HEALTHCARE IN THE INCREASING COSTS IS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. YOU KNOW LABOR NEGOTIATIONS AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT THEIR THIRD ON THE PRECIPICE OF A STRIKE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE REASONS BEHIND THAT IS INCREASING EL COSTS IN AS WAS REFERRED TO EARLIER. I MEAN THERE'S INCREASING COSTS -- WE NEED MORE MONEY ON THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND AND TO COME TOGETHER AS EMPLOYERS TO SAVE MONEY BECAUSE IN AN ENTRY LIKE OURS WITH LOW MARGINS. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TO PAY OUR WORKERS WHAT THERE WERE TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS THAT THEY WANT THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE THEM. AND THIS IS PUTS NO LIMIT ON INCREASES ALL IT ASKS FOR IS TRANSPARENCY -- IF AS PEOPLE ASSERT THAT INCREASES IN COSTS ARE TRULY NOT GOING UP -- THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH WITH THE TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN SAY WELL OKAY THAT STATE SAID. YOUR RATES ARE COOL IF THEY'RE NOT COOL THEY'RE NOT COOL BUT THE END OF THE DAY -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE TRANSPARENCY IS THERE A TWO ALLOWS TO SAVE MONEY TO LIVE PROVIDES THE CARE THEY HEALTH CARE THAT ARE EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES -- NEED AND THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THEM SO RESPECT ANSWER ABOUT. CAN'T WE ARE OUT OF TIME SO YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN POSITION AND YOUR VISIT. FOR HEALTH ACCESS TEAMSTERS IN NIGER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

ARE WE DONE WITH SUPPORT. WE ARE -- LIKE THE DUDE ADD SPORT. YES I'M HERE IN SUPPORT ON PLEASE SEND ALL WITH THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE AND WAREHOUSE UNION. IN THE INLAND BOATMEN JUNIOR OF THE PACIFIC IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. RIGHT OPPOSITION THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE -- SOME BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVEN THIRTY ONE OFFERS I'D LIKE TO SAY WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY AMENDMENTS SO WE CAN'T COMMENT ON THOSE. AND YOU KNOW THE HOWEVER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF THOSE AMENDMENTS -- DAYS SEEM JUST CLARIFYING IN NATURE DON'T CHANGE THE UNDERLYING POLICY AND THEREFORE DON'T CHANGE OUR POSITION ON THE BILL SO. THANK YOU -- THE FIRST LIKE TO START OFF SAYING THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WERE IMPORTANT YOUR HEALTH CARE WE MADE STRIDES THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IN INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH COVERAGE TO MORE MORE CALIFORNIANS. WE'RE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THOSE PROPOSALS. WE KNOW THAT -- THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIALOGUE AROUND AFFORDABILITY IN COST CONTAINMENT SUPPLEMENTS. THOSE COVERAGE INCREASES AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN FACTWE SUPPORTED BILLS TODAY THEY GO DIRECTLY UP THE D. UNDERLYING COST OF HEALTH CARE -- IN SO WHERE DO YOU CAN YOU CONDITION OF COURSES APPEARS IN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO IT TO BE A PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL GOES IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- ONE OF MY MAIN POINTS HERE IS THAT THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE TRANSPARENCY BILL. THIS BILL IS A DIRECT REGULATORY INTERVENTION ON HEALTH PLAN RATES BETTER AGREED TO BETWEEN TWO PARTIES THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE LARGE EMPLOYERS. WE BELIEVE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN BETWEEN THIS PROCESS. AND TO CHARACTERIZE THESE AGREEMENTS BY -- POTENTIALLY STAMPING THEM IS UNREASONABLE. THIS BILL IN OUR VIEW SUGGESTED SUBJECTS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LARGE EMPLOYER PRODUCTS TO REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS THAT WILL BE EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER FOR BOTH THE STATE AND THE HEALTH PLANS. THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYER PRODUCTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE TEAM MADE SEE IN CD I REPORTED THIS YEAR THAN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND RENEWING LARGER PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. THE BUREAUCRATIC UNDERTAKING REQUIRED BY THIS BILL WILL INCREASE HEALTHCARE COSTS. OPERATING COSTS FOR THE DO YOU NEED SEE WHICH IS ENTIRELY FUNDED BY THE HEALTH PLANS -- IN CD I WOULD RISE DUE TO IT ADDED TO MINISTRY REQUIREMENTS TO GROW THESE AGENCIES AND OF COURSE HEALTH PLANS WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ON NEW ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH THE V. I. REGULATORY PROCESS. SO WITH A DOUBLE WHAMMY ON OUR ADMIN LOAD -- ADDING ADDITIONAL BUREAUCRATIC RECORD BUREAUCRACY AND HEALTH CARE WILL NOT LOWER COSTS FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS INSTEAD THESE COST INCREASES WILL BE PASSED ON IT ALSO CONSUMES MORE OF THE PREMIUM DOLLAR LESS GOES ON TO DIRECT CARE MORE GOES TO ADMINISTRATION. FURTHERMORE -- AB. SEVENTY THIRTY A. B. C.'S ME -- SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS REDUNDANT OF OTHER POLICIES -- ERR OR NEXUS OF THOSE LARGE GROUP RATE INFORMATION ISCURRENTLY PUBLIC IN TRANSPARENT -- CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF DATA AND REPORTING LAWS IN OTHER TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS INCLUDING SUBMISSION OF AGGREGATED LARGE GROUP RATES. TO STATE REGULATORS. SO YES WE HAVE TRANSPARENCY ALREADY ON LARGE GROUP RATES. THIS RESULTS IN PUBLIC REPORTS BY TWO AGENCIES AND PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE HELD BY TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS AS WELL ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. SO WHAT IS THIS TRANSPARENCY SHOWN -- LARGER PREMIUM INCREASES ACCORDING TO THE LAST REPORT ARE LOWER THAN IN OTHER MARKETS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE -- UNIVERSE -- ALSO LARGE TO PREMIUMS ARE TRAINING AT A LOWER RATE THAN MEDICAL TRAINED IN PHARMACY TREND -- IN THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORTS. IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES ARE IN GOLDEN PLAN IN THE CLEVELAND BENEFIT PLANS A COMPARABLE RATES ON TO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET SO THEY'RE GETTING A GOOD VALUE ON IN IN IN THAT MARKET. CAP IS SUPPORTED SOME OF THESE TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS ARE REFERRING TO WHEN THEY BENEFIT CONSUMERS IN THE MARKET HOWEVER WE HAVE TO STRIKE A REGIONAL BALANCE AND WE DON'T BELIEVE OF THIS BILL DOES THAT. WERE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE HEALTH PAYMENTS DATA REVIEW COMMITTEE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ASKYOU YEAR. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE -- AND SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEES TO ESTABLISH TIME YOU KNOW -- SYSTEM WIDE TRANSPARENCY ON IN THE EFFORT TO LOWER COSTS IN AND YOU KNOW WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN COME TO SOME SORT OF STOP POSITIVE STRUCTURE AROUND THAT -- SO ON TOP OF EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN CURRENTLY DONE WE DON'T BELIEVE IS A COMPELLING REASON NOW IT'S YOU REQUIRE LARGE GROUP RATES TO BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW. FOR REQUIRE OUR PLAS TO TO SUBMIT A VOLUMINOUS AMOUNTS OF NEW INFORMATION. THERE FOR WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE THANK YOU. SEVEN WALK INS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TO HEAR ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO SEE THIS IT IS EXPANSION THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY I'M INTERESTED JUSTICE NOT UNDERSCORE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED BUT WHEN THE OVER MUCH ABOUT MY ADMINISTRATION PUT TOGETHER RATE REVIEW THEY SPECIFICALLY DID LOOK AT THE SMALL AN INDIVIDUAL GROUP MARKETS. POTENTIALLY THOSE ARE PRICE TAKERS THERE'S NO NEGOTIATION THERE THIS ARE OFF THE SHELF PRODUCTS AND AS THEY LOOKED AT LARGE GROUP THEY ACTUALLY UNDERSCORED. THE FACT THAT THESE ARE SOPHISTICATED ENTITIES. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE THAT OUR MEMBERS STRIVE TO PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AND DISCLOSE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT GOES INTO THE RATE DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT THEIR PREMIUM VALUE GETS THEM. SO WHEN WE DID ADOPT IN CALIFORNIA LAW THE ORIGINAL RATE REVIEW A DID HAVE A TRIGGER MECHANISM THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID CHOOSE AT SOME POINT TO ADD LARGE GROUP. THAT IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER ON IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT THROUGH THAT PROCESS AT NO TIME TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CHOOSE INCLUDE LARGE GROUP WE THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DID ACKNOWLEDGE THE SOPHISTICATION OF THOSE ENTITIES. AND THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO NEGOTIATE THE BEST RATES AND BENEFITS STRUCTURES FOR THEIR MEBER COMPANIES SO WE ARE CONCERNED CERTAINLY WITH ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN BURDEN TO THE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO MOVE THROUGH THE LARGE VOLUME OF RATE. AND FILINGS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JOHN WINGER IBF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS APOLOGIZE FOR NOT DINNER LETTER AND ON TIME BUT WE ARE MAIN POST. THANK YOU. VALERIE NERVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU. I SEE ANOTHER WITNESS OPPOSITION QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NOW IS OUR MOTION. OKAY A JUDGE OF QUESTION TWO OKAY CENTER LEYVA A QUICK COMMENT -- SINCE TO THIS -- GROCERS THAT TALKED ABOUT THE THAT WHILE I WAS THERE ALL HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE DAYS I DON'T REMEMBER IF. HE WAS THERE OR NOT -- BUT I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO PAY WAGES BECAUSE I GOOD WAY JUST BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SCABIES IN NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT NOW WAGES ARE STICKING POINT. SO -- GOOD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THE WAGES AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. I THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT IT'S BEEN NOT TO MOVE VICE ARE LEAVE -- I FIRST OF ALL -- SO RICARDO AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THEIR COMMITTEE IN TAKING THE AMENDMENTS -- I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION IS PRETTY MUCH OPPOSED TO THE THRUST OF THE BILL ITSELF SO I'M NOT SURE ANY AMENDMENTS WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND ON THAT WE DID TRY AND APPRECIATE YOU WORKED WITH US TO TRY TO LEAST. DECREASE SOME OF THE REPORTING BURDEN I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE AND THE CONCERN OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE VOLUME AND AMOUNT OF MINISTRY OF WORKING COSTS THAT MIGHT OCCUR TO THE PLAN AS WELL AS THE STATE SO I APPRECIATED THAT SAID THAT'S A CONCERN BUT I DO THINK THAT THE THRUST. OF THE BILL ITSELF IS ACTUALLY -- AND AND HAVING THIS RATE REVIEWED THERE IS VALUE TO THAT AND AND SO -- SO THEY'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- WHICH LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE IS VALUE. IT'S RARE THAT WE ARE ALREADY HAVE A PROVEN MODEL THAT WORKS THAT WE CAN EXPAND THE TARDY SAVE. BILLION GREAT REVIEWS BEEN A FRACTION OF THE EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE I THINK THE HALF BILLION DOLLARS SAVED CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AS WELL WORTH THAT INVESTMENT AND NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND IT I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE OF OPPOSITION BECAUSE THAT HAPPILY DOLLARS CAME FROM SOMEWHERE AND IT CAME. FROM RATES ARE UNREASONABLY HIGH AND SO -- IT BROUGH GONNA TRY TO GET MORE MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF LARGE EMPLOYERS BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS WITHOUT RESPECT GAS WHEN I VOTE. THANK YOU SO THE IT'S BEEN MOVED THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AM I AND II STONE STONE NO GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I GROVE HER TADO LEYVA THEY'VE AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING MONNING AYE RUBIO.

YEAH SORRY SO LET'S START WITH ITEM NUMBER. FIFTEEN EIGHTY NINE ONE NINE THREE CHAIRED MEMBERS BEFORE I BEGIN MY PRESENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND FIVE THE STAFF OF FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE ON NOT ON MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. THE PURPOSE AT EIGHTY NINE NINETEEN IS TO ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL TO TOOLS AND ENFORCEMENT. TO PREVENT BODY BURKE GREEN SCHEMES THAT PREY ON VULNERABLE PATIENTS SEEKING LEGITIMATE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF CALIFORNIA'S OF AMERICA'S APPEARED CRISIS REALLY IS STAGGERING IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED FROM. AIDS. AND ACCORDING TO THE CDC HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE DIE IN THE UNITED STATES TERM OPIOIDS EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS NOW MAKES OPIOID OVERDOSE AT TOP FIVE CAUSE OF DEATH. IT'S HEARTBREAKING AND AT EVERY STEP WE HAVE UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS WHO ARE PROFITEERING FROM THIS CRISIS. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES DOCTORS HAVE KNOWINGLY OVER PRESCRIBED THESE DRUGS AND UNSCRUPULOUS REHABILITATION CENTER OPERATORS TO EXPLOIT PATIENTS FOR PROFIT. WELL THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS OPERATING IN THIS SPACE AND DOING GOOD WORK. THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY HORROR STORIES PATIENT IS RECRUITED FROM OUT OF STATE BY A BODY BROKER. OUT OF NETWORK INSURANCE POLICIESARE PURCHASED AND RUN OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AFTER THIRTY SIXTY NINETY DAYS WHEN INSURANCE RUNS OUT THE PATIENT IS CARBS EXACERBATING CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. SOMETIMES PATIENTS ARE EVEN ENCOURAGED TO RELAPSE IN ORDER FOR THE CYCLE TO BEGIN AGAIN A CYCLE THAT FAR TOO OFTEN ENDS IN THE PATIENT'S DEATH. THIS BILL AB NINE NINETEEN BUILDS OFF AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY SB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT LAST YEAR AND THE ELIMINATING KICKBACKS. IN RECOVERY ACTIVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCE AND ADDITIONAL TOOLS FOR ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO INSURE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION AT THE RECENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AIMED AT ENDING THE HORRIFIC AND PACKS AS SPECIFICALLY AB NINE NINETEEN WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO ESTABLISH ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM TO STOP THE BODY BURKE CREEN SCHEMES. ADDITIONALLY THE SPELL LIMITS HOW FACILITIES THAT OFFER HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AS INDUCEMENTS TO TREATMENT. ARE ABLE TO TO DO SO. THANK YOU AND ACTUALLY THEIR SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES SO -- STUDENTS -- SO GRAVITY WOULD BE APPRECIATED EVEN HER EMOTION NOW ALREADY SO. REVENUE CREATED THANK YOU IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THESE PROJECTS. WATER A CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME'S EVAN MARNIE I'VE BEEN IN LONG TERM RECOVERY NOW FOR OVER FOURTEEN YEARS AND WORKING IN THE PROFESSION OF ADDICTION% TREATMENT. FOR ALMOST ELEVEN YEARS NOW I'M CURRENTLY THE OWNER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AN OUTPATIENT PROGRAM BURBANK CALIFORNIA. I PERSONALLY TAKING CALLS FROM PEOPLE THAT WERE TIRED OF LIVING WITHIN THIS CYCLE OF EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE -- ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT COMES TO MIND WAS WOULD HAVE BEEN SOBER FOR FIVE MONTHS AND HAD A JOB AND WAS TOLD THAT HE NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO GO TO INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IN ORDER TO KEEP HIS HOUSING. HE DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT ANYMORE HE DID MEET MEDICAL CRITERIA -- AND SO. THERE'S OTHER THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES THAT I CAN SPEAK OF I'VE ALSO TAKING CALLS FROM ATTENDING -- FROM PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING TO THEIR TREATMENT CENTERS AND GETTING TREATMENT FOR THEIR LIFE THREATENING DISEASE OF AT OF ADDICTION BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR INSURANCE WOULD NOT PERMIT THEM TO REMAIN IN TREATMENT WERE TURNED OUT INTO THE STREETS. INCREASING -- INCREASING ARE HOMELESS POPULATION AS WE NOTING CALIFORNIA -- THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING GIVEN FREE HOUSING IN COORDINATION WITH THEM BEING AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE TOLD ENCOURAGING EVEN GIVEN THE MEANS TO RELAX IN ORDER TO CONTINUE IN THEIRTREATMENT ONCE INSURANCE STOPS AUTHORIZING. ALLOWING THEM TO REMAIN IN RECOVERY RESIDENCES OR SOBER LIVING HOMES SOME MAKE IT BACK AND OTHERS DON'T. THESE HOMES ARE WRITTEN WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL USING AND ALLOWED TO USE. IT FOR SOMEONE SEEKING RECOVERY IT PAINTS A REALLY DIM PICTURE NOT ONLY OF RECOVERY BUT THE TREATMENT COMMUNITY. THIS OVER ARCHING KERR IS CREE LOT OF DISTRUST OF A PROFESSION PEOPLE WHO WERE AT THE MOST HORRIBLE STAGE. REACHED OUT AND WE'RE TOLD WILL FLY YOU OUT AND EVERYTHING WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF ONCE AGAIN END UP HOMELESS STILL USING THEIR DREADED CHOICE AND EVEN DYING MANY OF THESE PEOPLE CHOOSE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE ARE FOR THINKERS WE ARE INNOVATIVE IN OUR TREATMENT PRO CHOICE. AND WHY NOT. EIGHTY NINE NINETEEN WILL END THESE PRACTICES WHILE PROTECTING LEGITIMATE TREATMENT PROVIDERS WHO WISH TO HELP PEOPLE FIND HOUSING OR GAIN ACCESS TO TREATMENT IN FAIR AND TRANSPARENT WAYS THAT DO NOT REPLACE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WITH PROFIT MOTIVE. I THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN PETRIE-NORRIS FOR HER WILLINGNESS AND TO ADDRESS THIS FORMER PATIENT BROKERING IN ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS AGAIN BREVITY'S REALLY APPRECIATED A DAY THAT'S CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS WITH THE SPONSORS OF TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT INDUCEMENTS AREN'T COVERED BY THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT -- READ IT AS ONLY A REFERRALS FROM THIRD PARTY SO THIS WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS THIS APP PART BROKEN OUR DRIVER.

WILL IMPROVE AN UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S FRAMEWORK FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. HI THIS IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO ENABLE LAWMAKERS TO DEVELOP SOUND POLICY IN THIS AREA HI I'M WITH THAT I'M REALLY PLEASED TO INTRODUCE A SUPPORTER HERE TO TESTIFY. WHEN THE MCINTYRE THE FOUNDER OF CHARTS Là? OKAY THANK YOU WELCOME. THREE RUNNING BACK AND FIRE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I GOT THAT CALL THAT NO PARENT WANTS TO GET. MY SON JURíDICAMENTE TO SOBER LIVING HOME IRONICALLY CALLED THE SAFE HOUSE. I WANTED TO GET IN BED AND STAY THERE BUT INSTEAD I DECIDED TO BECOME BETTER AND NOT DETER. NOW I DEDICATE THE REST OF MY LIFE TO SAVING OTHERS BY FOUND INSURANCE LAW. MY STORY IS NOT UNIQUE I STAND HERE TODAY FOR THE HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS OF LOST THEIR LIVES AT ROGUE GREE HAPPENS. I INVESTIGATE THESE DEATHS THE DAILY ON I'M HORRIFIED AND WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN I GOT A CALL ABOUT ANOTHER YOUNG BOY DONOVAN DOYLE LIKE MY SON SHARE AND HE DIED IN A ROW REHAB. THEN IT WAS TERRY. ROBERT CHAD ERIC JAMES AND MATTHEW.

I AM HERE TODAY TO GIVE A VOICE TO VICTIMS SURVIVORS AND FIGHTERS. AS WE CHALLENGE THIS BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT PLACES PROFIT OVER PEOPLE SAFETY. THE STIGMA OF ADDICTION AND THE FEAR OF BEING JUDGED WILL OFTEN HAVE FAMILIES WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP. THEY OFTEN FEEL TERRIFIED ALONE AND DESPERATE TO FIND HELP FOR THEIR LOVED. ONE SOME PROVIDERS WILL STRATEGICALLY PREY UPON THIS FEAR TO GET A YOUNG PERSON INTO THEIR SO CALLED TREATMENT PROGRAM. FOR MANY FAMILIES THIS PREDATORY BEHAVIOR WILL APPEAR AS A GIFT A KIND AND COMPASSIONATE STRANGER WHO CAN ANSWER THEIR PRAYERS INTO THEIR CHILD IS RETURNED HOME IN A BODY BAG. THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT. AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ACCESS TO MENTALHEALTH SERVICES OVER THE LAST DECADE. EXPANDING COVERAGE TO MORE THAN SIXTY TWO MILLION AMERICANS. WHO HAD LITTLE TO NO BENEFITS BEFORE? HOWEVER THIS RISE IN ACCESS TO REHABILITATION CARE THROUGH THE ACA AND MH PA. COMBINED WITH THE HEIGHTENING. OPIOID AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE CRISIS AND INFUSION OF PRIVATE EQUITY DOLLARS INTO THE REHABILITATION INDUSTRY HAS CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT RIGHT FOR PROFITEERING AND FRAUD IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. JERRY IT'S LAWS ABOUT GETTING. IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO GET SOBER IN A HEALTHY AND SAFE WAY. THERE MUST BE FAIL SAFES IN PLACE. I'M HERE TODAY AS JURORS MOM AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHER ACTIVISTS MOTHERS AND FATHERS SEEKING CHANGE.

WONDERFUL WILL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY STAFF ON THE AMENDMENTS -- THE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HI AND I STONE STONE AYE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I GROW HER TANTO LEYVA. MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING MONNING AYE RUBIO. OKAY THE CURRENT LOTUS FIVE ZERO OF THE VOTES TO GET OUT HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND FINALLY YOU'RE PRESENTING ITEM NUMBER TWENTY THREE AB. THIRTEEN OH NINE BY SOME OF OUR CON I THINK THIS ONE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MORE DISCUSSION. READY HE LEFT YOU WITH THAT. ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AT FIRST AS THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND EXTENDS FOR HER THANKS TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE SPELL. AB THIRTEEN OH NINE WOULD CHANGE THE OPEN ENROLLMENT DEADLINE FROM JANUARY FIFTEENTH TO JANUARY THIRTY FIRST. FOR INDIVIDUALS TO PURCHASE INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE IN OUR STATE'S EXCHANGE COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET ALLOWING MORE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. AB THIRTEEN OH NINE HELPS IN THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR STATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND BENEFITS THE NEARLY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CONSUMERS THAT PURCHASED THEIR COVERAGE AND COVER CALIFORNIA AND FORMER STATES INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKET. AS THE NEW YEAR BEGAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIANS ONLY HAD TWO WEEKS TO SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE IN JANUARY. DUE TO THIS AND OTHER FEDERAL ROLL BACKS THE ACA COVER CALIFORNIA SOUGHT DROP THE 24% IN NEW ENROLLMENT. PROVIDING CONSUMERS ENOUGH TIME TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES ABOUT DIFFERENT COVERAGE OPTIONS IS THE SENSIBLE THING TO DO ESPECIALLY DURING A HECTIC STRESSFUL AND OFTENTIMES COSTLY HOLIDAY SEASON. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE TAKING TODAY WILL MITIGATE LAPSE OF COVERAGE BY CREATING THE MECHANISM NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE PLANTS GET ELEVEN MONTHS WORTH OF PAYMENTS. AND THE CONSUMERS GET ELEVEN MONTHS WORTH OF COVERAGE. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO SPEAK HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BELL. AND JTS FROM HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA AND LYNETTE. TEN A RELIC FROM THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. THANK YOU WELCOME THESE BEGIN. MR CHAN MEMBERS AND JDS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA PROUD TO BE CO SPONSOR OR SPONSORING AB. THIRTEEN OH NINE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR JUST REQUIRED CALIFORNIANS TO PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE BY REINSTATING THE MANDATE. AB THIRTEEN OH NINE IS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO DO JUST THAT -- BY GIVING THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME AFTER THE HOLIDAYS TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE EVERY YEAR COVER CALIFORNIA COMPETES WITH HOLIDAY MARKETING. MARKETING ADDITIONALLY A DURING EVEN NUMBERED OF YEARS COVERED CALIFORNIA DELAYS MARKETING AND ADVERTISING UNTIL AFTER THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. YOU TOO HIGH ADVERTISING COSTS AND TO AVOID COMPETING WITH ELECTION CAMPAIGN ADS THIS EFFECTIVELY SHORTENS THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD BY TWO TO THREE WEEKS. THERE IS ALSO YOU EVIDENCE THAT SHOW PEOPLE WHO SIGN UP DURING THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF JANUARY TEND TO BE HEALTHIER THAN THOSE WHO SIGN UP EARLIER. IN CONTRAST PEOPLE WHO NOTING NEED CARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONGOING HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE THE FIRST TO REVIEW AND SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE. YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE WILL BE A GAP IN COVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO SIGN UP IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF JANUARY. WE HAVE OFFERED NUMBER OF OPTIONS TO HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND DRAFTED AMENDMENTS GET SOME NONE OF THEM SEEM TO WORK OPERATIONALLY FOR THE PLANS. UNLIKE OTHER KINDS OF INSURANCE SUCH AS AUTO HOMEOWNERS FLOOD AND OTHERS HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH INSURANCE CANNOT TAKE A PREMIUM PAYMENT AND MAKE COVERAGE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY WE CANNOT EXPLAIN THIS. HEALTH PLANS ARE ALSO NOT SET UP TO ACCEPT PAYMENT FOR PART OF THE MONTH SO IF YOU SIGN UP ON JANUARY. THIRTY ONE AND THEY GET A CHECK FOR THE PREMIUM ON FEBRUARY TWO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT FOR COVERAGE UNTIL MARCH ONE WE CAN EXPLAIN THIS ALSO. IF THE HEALTH PLANS ARE UNABLE TO ENROLL PEOPLE IN COVERAGE PROPERLY OR FOR PART OF A MONTH IT IS THE HEALTH PLANS CREATING THAT GAP IN COVERAGE NOT THE CONSUMER WHO SIGNED UP FOR COVERAGE. AND PAID THEIR PREMIUMS AND ONE STAR COVERAGE TO START IMMEDIATELY. WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL OF PEOPLE GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE AND CALIFORNIA NOW REQUIRES IS AB THIRTEEN OH NINE MAKES IT EASIER FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. A LINDA TENER WHAT'S ON BEHALF OF THECALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN OH NINE AS THIS BILL TAKES A STEP TOWARD REDUCING BARRIERS TO ACCESS. IN FACT RECENT COVER CALIFORNIA DATA HAS SHOWN A DECREASE IN ENROLLMENT AMONG SPANISH SPEAKING AND KERKORIAN SPEAKING CONSUMERS. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY WHO MAY NEED ADDITIONAL TIME TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR COVERAGE OPTIONS AND ENROLL. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE MIDST. OF A BUSY. AND OFTEN BUSY TIME OF YEAR WE SEE THIS AS AN ISSUE OF EQUITY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON AB. THIRTEEN OH NINE THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BACK MICROPHONE. RENTS SPENCER BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LYDIA BORN AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. BRANDON MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT. WHAT IS OPPOSITION? PLEASE MAKE SOME ROOM FOR WELCOME. I THINK YOU -- BOBBY BRIEF MISTER CHURNING LOUISE'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS WHICH SEVEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE -- HANDED OUT TODAY I WANT TO CLARIFY IN OUR OUR MAIN ISSUE IS THAT WE WANT IN ROLE -- COVERAGE TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET FOR FOR ENROLLEES AS EARLY IN THE YEAR AS POSSIBLE -- WHEN WE DO THIS IT MEANS MORE MONTHS OF COVERAGE MORE MONTHS OF PREMIUM COLLECTION THAT'S BETTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND ROLY AND IT'S OUR IT'S BETTER FOR THE OVERALL MARKET IN THERE FOR ALL ENROLLEES? SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN EFFECTUATE COVERAGE ON FEBRUARY FIRST INSTEAD OF MARCH FIRST. AND SO YOU THERE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IT'S NOT REALLY AFFECT YOU IN THE COVERAGE -- THERE'S MORE THAN THAT THERE'S GIVEN THE PERSON'S ID CARD OUT THERE'S MAKING SURE THAT THE ENROLLEES ARE IN THE PROVIDER OR NETWORK PROVIDER SYSTEMS AND IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH PLAN ENROLLEE. ID CENTER SO THERE'S SO A YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT'S OUR THING THAT WE WE WE WANT COVERAGE TO START AS EARLY IN THE YEAR AS POSSIBLE WE THINK IT'S BETTER FOR PEOPLE IN THERE FOR THE MARKET AND SO. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AT IT AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THESE IN THE MEANTIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION TO NON QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MOTION OF THE OCEAN FROM CENTER MINING -- SO. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING -- FOR FOR SOME A MEMBER OF OUR CON I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT -- APPRECIATE THAT THE HEALTH PLANS WE GOT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO -- RECOGNIZING THAT FORTUNE WE ALSO ARE OFFERING UP AGAINST HUMAN BEHAVIOR WHICH IS WAITING TILL THE LAST MINUTE ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE RELATIVELY HEALTHY -- SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS AND CONTINUE WORKING AND SPONSORS ON THIS -- SO WITHOUT WHICH LIKE CLOSE. IN LATE THE AUTHORED SHARES THE SAME GOALS I AM INSURING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SIGN FOR COVERAGE. AND MINIMIZING COVERAGE GAPS YEAH I THINK THAT THE GOAL OF EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS TO COVERS MANY CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE AND THAT CERTAINLY THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. HI THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND DEATH. ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR QUE HAN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR PRIVATE. OF LET'S KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO REFER TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HI AND I STONE. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ SIDE GROW FURTADO LEYVA. THEY'VE AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL AYE MONNING MONNING AYE RUBIO. THE BILL HAS CERTAINLY FIVE ZERO SEVEN EFFORTS TO GET IT OUT TO HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU. RIGHT I THINK THE NEXT UP IS SUMMER QUIRK. HERE OKAY I THINK YOU ARE NEXT UP WITH. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY ONE AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT I'LL BE BRIEF. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SENATORS -- AB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT REQUIRES PROPRIA PRO. BIOTIC MANUFACTURERS TO LABEL THEIR PRODUCTS WITH THE GENUS SPECIES AND STRAIN. OF MICRO ORGANISMS IN DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE INDUSTRY GROUP. THE INTERNATIONAL FOOD ADDITIVES COUNSEL IN THIS NO OPPOSITION -- WITH ME TODAY IS ERIC LEVY A PHD STUDENT STUDYING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UC BERKELEY AND ZACH ABBOTT PHD SCIENTIST IN THE C. E. O. OF C. BIOTICS. A WELCOME -- SHE DIED NO YOU FOR WAY TO LONG TIME FISHY TO KEEP IT BRIEF THANK YOU. HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WON A COMPETITION HOSTED BY THE UC CENTER OF SACRAMENTO WHICH ASKED TO GRADUATE STUDENTS TO DRAW ON OUR UNIQUE EXPERTISE TO PROPOSE NEW POLICY IDEAS -- CURRENT PROBIOTICS LABELS INCLUDE BACTRIS SPECIES BUT SCIENTISTS PREFER TO USE AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY WHICH IS CALLED THE STRAIN. YOU CAN THINK OF BACTERIAL STRAINS LIKE BREEDS OF DOGS ALL DOGS ARE THE SAME SPECIES BUT IF YOU IMAGINE A DOCKS AND AS A POLICE CANINE. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECIFICITY PASSED A SPECIES LEVEL. SIMILARLY A BACTRIS SPEED STRAIN IMPACTS ITS FUNCTION BUT STRAINS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE LISTED ON MANUFACTURE LABELS UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL LAW. MORE DETAILED STRAIN LEVEL LABELING AS A RESULT OF AB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL. THANK YOU. I THINK FOR ME SPEAK TODAY AND I KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. MY NAME IS ZACH ABIT -- A PEACHY MICROBIOLOGIST AND THE CEO OF THE PROBIOTICS COMPANY. I SUPPORT MANDATORY MANDATORY PROBIOTIC STRAIN LABELING FOR TWO MAIN REASONS FIRST PROBIOTIC BUSINESSES SUCH AS MINE ARE PREDICATED ON THE SCIENTIFIC FACT. THAT BACTERIAL STRAINS HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES WE GO THROUGH YEARS OF AFTER IN RIGOR TO ISOLATE DEVELOP AND CHARACTER AYE STRAINS AND THEN FILE PATENTS TO PROTECT THE STRAINS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXCLUSIVE USE. WITHOUT MANDATORY STRAIN LABELING THIS EFFORT IS UNDER CUT MEASLES. SECOND WITHOUT REQUIREMENT FOR MANUFACTURER TO LABEL THEIR STRAINS THERE IS AN THERE IS THEREFORE NO REQUIREMENT TO EVEN KNOW WHAT TRAINS THEY'RE PUTTING INTO THEIR PRODUCTS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC OR THE INDUSTRY THANKS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BRENT IN MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT.

I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BEING SHARED WITH YOU WHICH REMOVE THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIFIC FACILITIES. AND IN ADDITION A DELETE THE SUNSET FROM THE BILL. MOVING FORWARD I WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IN REFINING DEFINITIONS WITHIN THE BILL. AB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN ASSESSING OUR CAPACITY TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STATEWIDE. THIS BILL REQUIRES ARE SPREAD. TO TRACK A BY TIME THE WAITING PERIODS FOR PATIENTS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. THE STATE A SPECIFIC PURPOSE IS TO GAIN FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING HOW LONG PATIENTS ARE WAITING FOR DISCHARGE OR TRANSFER ESPECIALLY IN CASES WHERE THERE IS NEED OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE. WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE IN NEED OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY OFTEN SEEK CARE AT THE NEAREST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT? IN MANY CASES ONCE YOU VALUE WAITED. A PATIENT MUST BE TRANSFERRED TO A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT TO BETTER ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. ALTHOUGH IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EXTENDED PERIODS OF WAIT TIME FOR INDIVIDUALS IN NEED THE SERVICES IS A PROBLEM. THERE'S BEEN MORE TALK THAN ACTION. AB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR REPLACES RHETORIC WITH DATA ALLOWING US TO BETTER EVALUATE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TRANSFERS AND DISCHARGES IN WAITING PERIODS. ESPECIALLY THOSE REQUIRING AND REQUESTING PSYCHIATRIC. CARE HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL IS TO MADDEN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. BUT BROWN MEMBERS TO MAN RIVERS IN THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE MAN CALLED EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IN WERE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL FOR SURE LIKE THE THINK THE STAFF AND CHAIR FOR THEIR TIME AND DISCUSSIONS ON THE BILL. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF FINALLY PUTTING SOME DATA TO THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE IN THE MERGED APARTMENT EVERY DAY. WHICH IS OUR CHALLENGE WAS GETTING OURS ARE MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS TO THE CARE THAT THEY REALLY NEED OUR JOB IS TO STABILIZE THE PATIENT. AND THEN ASSESS THEM IF THEY DO HAVE AN UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION NEEDS ORE CARE WE NEED TO TRANSFER THEM. ME TO ANOTHER FACILITY ANECDOTALLY WE TALK ABOUT STORIES OF A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL UC DAVIS TO STAY IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT FOR THIRTY DAYS WAITING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FACILITY. I'LL BE NICE TO UNDERSTAND IT THIS IS AN ANOMALY AT THIS IS A ONE TIME SITUATION OR FOR SEEING SOME TYPE OF A TREND IN THIS AREA THIS DATA WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IPHONE. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BRANDON MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WITH SUPPORT BILL AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING ON THIS. THANK YOU. RIGHT -- WITNESSES OPPOSITION. IT'S COME UP TO THE TABLE. CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX HAWTHORN THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION. ON THIS BILL I WANT TO SAY THAT WE AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID WHEN WE SURVEYED OUR HOSPITALS LAST YEAR THEY IDENTIFIED. EMERGENCY ROOM OVERCROWDING FROM MAJOR HEALTH ISSUES IS THEIR NUMBER ONE ISSUE. SO WE KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM MORE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING IT. THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS WHEN WE LOOK AT IT WE HAVE TO DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. WE ARE BEING ASKED TO EXPAND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO COMPLY WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WE DO A LOT OF REPORTING ALREADY -- WE DON'T ALWAYS SUPPOSING REPORTING BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPENDING PROBABLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO IT WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW CLEARLY WHAT THE RETURN S GOING TO BE AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT IS BAD WHERE DATA DRIVEN ORGANIZATION. BUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM WE WOULD RATHER EXPEND OUR RESOURCES SOLVING THE PROBLEM -- IN THAT MANNER SO IT THIS TIME WE HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION APPRECIATE THE BUILDING NARROWED HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON IT -- ESPECIALLY WITH THE REGULATOR WHO KNOWS HOW THESE ISSUES WORK VERY WELL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THEO PALES REPRESENTED AT HEALTH FACILITIES -- WE TOO ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROBLEM WE'VE ACTUALLY PUT ARM A POCKETBOOK WARM MOUTH IS WE OWN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE WORKED WITH THIS SPONSORING YOUR COMMITTEE ON A BILL THAT WAS HERE I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST WEEK MAYBE WAS TWO WEEKS AGO TO MAKE SURE THESE PEOPLE GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND GET TAKEN CARE OF QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE MAKE SURE ALL FACILITIES IN THE COUNTY ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT IN DENVER AT THAT IT. ENDEAVOR YOU KNOW. UP IMAGES ROOMS VERY MUCH OUR FUNCTION OF SOCIETY AND RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT PRETTY RIGHT WE IT IS AMAZING THAT THESE PEOPLE WORKING ARMORED ASSUMES EVEN GET THROUGH THE DAY -- WE COLLECT A TON OF DATA AMONG DOING OTHER THINGS. THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS PARTICULAR DATA SAID IS THAT THERE'S A TIME STAMP ELEMENT TO IT THERE IS NOT JUST ANOTHER FIELD THAT WE CAN PUT IN OUR EXISTING SOFTWARE. SO WE HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL FOR THIS A LITTLE AMOUNT OF DATA GOING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES COST BENEFIT. COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. WE ALL THE MANDATES THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR WE PASSED A HOMELESS DISCHARGE BILL OR HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH JACKETS FOOD. TAXI CAB RIDES AND SHELTERS FOR PEOPLE FOR GOD. FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE DISCHARGED TO GET INTO WE ARE OVER TAXED YOU'RE ASKING US TO MAKE A BIG INVESTMENT FOR A LITTLE BIT OF DATA WE JUST DON'T THINK THE THRESHOLD HERE WE THINK THRESHOLD YEARS TOO LOW. IF YOU'RE GONNA REQUIRE SUSPEND THIS KIND OF MONEY IT SHOULD BE FOR REAL DATA WE BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. AND THIS IS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE. RIGHT AT THE OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT. QUESTIONS FOR ME MEMBERS IS OUR MOTION THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER LEYVA -- I TO SAY FIRST OF ALL I THANK YOU -- SOME REYES FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE WE DID WORK TO SLIM IT DOWN I CERTAINLY -- WE HEARD -- FROM THE HOSPITALS. I I DO THINK I REALIZE WITH DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THAT -- WE DID FEEL THAT THE TIME ISSUED THE TIME ACTUALLY -- WAS VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE DATA AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON THE REGISTER WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE GOING ON SO WE SLIM DOWN A LOT OF DATA ELEMENTS OF THE SPONSORS ORIGINALLY WANTED BECAUSE THAT WILL WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO GET AT WAS A GOING TO DO. AND THEY FINALLY AGREED SAID NO AND WE DIDN'T WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH US BUT AS WELL THE REGULATORS WELL SO. SHE YOU WILLIAMS CONCEDED WORK TOGETHER I THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR ELEMENT THAT WE HAVE IN THE BILL I REALIZE NOW THERE MAY BE SOME CHALLENGES DOING IT WE'VE BEEN CONVERSATIONS LAST BUT BUT CERTAINLY. WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORT THE AUTHORS EFFORT TO SAY IF THAT'S TRUE -- FIGURE OUT THOSE DATA ON THIS WE REALLY NEED TO GET SO -- WITH THAT -- WHICH LIKE CLOSE. I THINK THAT IF WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE JUST HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM IS AND UNLESS WE KNOW WHEN THE PERSON COMES INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THE TIME THEY COME IN AND THE TIME THEY ARE DISCHARGED. IT'S ALREADY RHETORICAL WE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW LONG THEY'RE WAITING IN THE WAITING ROOM. AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. ALONG WITH THE ISSUE REGARDING OUR MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS AND HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN BE TRANSFERRED. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE HEY THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED TO MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED -- SECURITIES CALL THE ROLL. HAND BY AN ICE STONE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I'D GROW FURTADO LEYVA LIVE AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING MONNING AYE RUBIO.

I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS OF FORTY CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AS WE DISCUSS THE BILL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE HEALTHY AND READY TO LEARN. IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO INSTITUTIONALIZED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH OVERSEES MEDI CAL AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COORDINATE VARIOUS HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DELIVERED THROUGH SCHOOLS. TO ADDRESS THIS A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WITH THE UPCOMING EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS THE PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN ASSISTING SCHOOLS THAT WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS. TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS MAY CONTINUE RECEIVING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL SITES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON A. B.

EVEN IN AND EVEN AN ENVIRONMENT OF INCREASED AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. BUT IT'S HARD IN A NOTE WE KNOW THIS FIRST HAND IT'S VERY HARD FOR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX TERRAIN. OF THIS MULTI DISCIPLINARY CROSS SECTORAL COLLABORATION AND TO WORK -- THEY STRUGGLE TO WORK WITH THE STATE'S MEDICAID SCHOOL MEDICAID PROGRAMS. AND WE KNOW THAT MANY STATES TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES BY CREATING OFFICES OF SCHOOL HEALTH SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT -- A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IS PROPOSING WE BELIEVE THIS WILL HELP. FURTHER ENRICH OUR PROGRAMS ARE SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND AND SERVE OUR YOUTH WELL SO WE ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TONY TRIGGER ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION BOTH OF THESE GROUPS TODAY ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL.

WE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING AND MAINTAIN THEIR PARTICIPATION WE MUST ENSURE A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROGRAM'S REQUIREMENTS. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS MUST AVOID PAY BACKS A PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING DO PROGRAM IRREGULARITIES. INCREASING SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTICIPATION IS A WAY TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF CREDENTIALED SCHOOL NURSES.

AGAIN NEXT SO -- THAT'S ITEM NUMBER TWENTY FIVE A. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY WELCOME. THANK YOU -- FIRST IMAGES THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL WE ARE HAPPY -- TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT FOOD SAFETY REQUIREMENTS OF THE SOUL EXPENSE OF THE FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY. AGAIN THE BILL ESTABLISHES BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR GROCERY DELIVERY THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS. FOR THESE ONLINE DELIVERY OUT COMPANIES THE BILL REQUIRES THE DELIVERY PERSON OF FOOD AND SAFETY TRAINING FOR FOOD TO SPOIL EASILY LIKE MEAT AND DAIRY. DELIVER ME COLD MUST MEET AND VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS AND HAVE LIABILITY INSURANCE. COMPOSED LIKE TO RESPONSIBLE IS ON THE GROCERY STORES AND THE ONLINE PLATFORM FOR FOOD DELIVERY IN PERMITS THE CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ENFORCE THE BILL IN ADOPTING ELATION. WITH THAT WE HAVE TO BRIEF WITNESSES OKAY AND JUST TO TO BE CLEAR THE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE MEN IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE ACTUALLY TAKEN UP PRIOR TO A JUDICIARY COMMITTEE GOT THANK YOU YEAH THIS WEEK. THANK YOU WITNESSES ABOARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I ALSO WANT TO ECHO. OF SEVEN MEMBER TAKES COMMENTS TAKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR EFFORTS. OF A BIRD A TRICKLE ME UP THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- AS FOLKS MAY KNOW. CURRENTLY THE THE DELIVERY PLATFORMS THE COMPANIES TO THE DELIVERIES FOR GROCERY STORES ARE COMPLETELY UNREGULATED. THERE ARE NO REGULATIONS RUN -- STANDARDS RUN A LAWSUIT COVER THEM IT'S A NEW INDUSTRY RECOGNIZE THAT. HOWEVER -- IT IS IMPORTANT. FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT THE FOOD THEY'RE GETTING IS NOT CONTAMINATED SETTLE TRIED ANYWAY THE BILL DOES THAT. I KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION IS GOING TO COME FORWARD AND AND TRY TO MAKE SOME COMPARISONS AND LET ME JUST -- START BY SAYING. THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO GROCERY STORES BECAUSE GROCERY STORES ALREADY HAVE -- THIRTY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RETAIL FOOD COURT WHICH IS OVER A HUNDRED PAGES AND HAS SEVERAL PROVISIONS INCLUDING -- PRODUCES FOR PROTECTION COME CONTAMINATION A TIME TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIPS UP FOOD STORAGE. THERE'S COVERAGE ALREADY IN THE STORES AND ALL OF THE DRIVERS TO DELIVER ON THE HELP THE STORES THAT ARE EMPLOYEES OF STORES ARE ALSO COVERED. IN THE REQUIRED TO HAVE REFRIGERATOR TRUCKS. THAT. LANGUAGE WAS PART OF THE REASONABLE WE REMOVED IT. BECAUSE OF THE IN RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION AND NOW THE BILL BASICALLY THE STANDARD FOR THE CARS AND LICENSING MEMBERS WILL BE WHAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR UBER LEFT. IN TERMS OF INSPECTIONS AND LICENSING SO WE PICKED UP THE BILL MAKES SENSE OF STREAMLINED AND A FOOD RUNNER CARD IS NO LONGER REQUIRED. BUT IT DOES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LEVEL. MISTER CHAIR JUST ONE FOR THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CHARACTERS WE REGULATE THE RETAIL FOOD FACILITIES AND WE APPRECIATE AMENDMENTS TAKEN. BECAUSE THAT'S MOVE THE BILL FROM THE LOCAL RETAIL FOOD INSPECTORS TO THE STATE WE CANNOT REGULATE ONE OF THESE MOVING. PLATFORMS WE ALSO JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT UNTIL THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE -- TRAINING OPERATION -- CERTIFICATION WE THINK THAT THE FOOD HANDLER TRAINING IS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THAT'S USEFUL IT IT COVERS -- A CROSS CONTAMINATION PREVENTION AND AND OTHER IMPORTANT FOOD SAFETY THING SOBRE AS AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THIRTY BOILS IN BEHALF OF AMERICAN STATURE GROWERS AB CALIFORNIA FRESH PRODUCE AS ASIAN WESTERN ACTORS ARE ASSOCIATION WHICH I THINK THE SOME WOMEN HIS STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE ARE NO LONGER POST ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT HEY THANK YOU. RIGHT. SEEN OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BUT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE. MAKE ROOM FOR THE OPPONENTS AT THE FRONT HERE IN HIS RIVER AT THE SIDE [inaudible] WELCOME. MR TURN MEMBERS CORPS IN JENSEN ALTEC MATT HERE TODAY I'M IN OPPOSITION AB -- THIRTEEN SIXTY WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- AND THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH YOU ALL -- AND YOUR STAFF ON ON THIS BILL I'M WE DO WERE REMAIN IN STRONG OPPOSITION -- WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT -- APPROPRIATE -- TRAINING AND FOR THE FOOD DELIVERY CON IN THE FOOD THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY CONTEXT -- THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN HAD WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT WE CONTINUE TO FEEL THAT -- REQUIRING US TO ABIDE BY CURRENT STATUTES THAT ARE MADE FOR THE COMMERCIAL FOOD DELIVERY IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS -- THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY -- MODELS -- SO THE BILL SPECIFICALLY. REQUIRES US TO AT THE SOLE EXPENSE OF THE THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY PROP FORMS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO DRIVERS AS OUTLINED UNDER CURRENT LAW WHICH WE AGAIN DO NOT BELIEVE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THESE BUSINESS MODELS THAT ALSO REQUIRES. AS THE PROPONENTS SAID A NINETEEN POINT VEHICLE INSPECTION EVERY TWO YEARS -- THIS MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN THE TNC CONTACTS WHEN THEY ARE TRANSPORTING PASSENGERS BOARD TALK ABOUT FOOD DELIVERY TRANSPORTATION HERE THIS IS TODD OR TALKING ABOUT FOOD DELIVERY FROM GROCERY STORES WHICH IS MUCH DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODEL THAN THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY BUSINESS MODEL. THE BILL ALSO GIVES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE ABILITY TO ASSESS A CIVIL PENALTY OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION AND DOES NOT REQUIRE GUIDANCE TO BE GIVEN TO THESE COMPANIES ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW PROVISIONS OF THE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE. I HAD REGULATIONS IS A DOT DOES NOT REQUIRE BEST PRACTICES OR ANY OTHER GUIDANCE THAT SAYS A MAY PROVIDE DOES NOT SAY SHALL. FINALLY AND QUICKLY UNDERSTAND IT'S LATE THE FDA FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT RULE -- ON SANITARY TRANSPORTATION FOR HUMAN AND ANIMAL FOOD WAS MADE FINAL ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN ADVANCE THE FDA'S EFFORTS TO PROTECT FOODS BY KEEPING THEM SAFE FROM CONTAMINATION DURING TRANSPORTATION. FTA ACTUALLY PUBLISHED THREE WAIVERS TO THIS ROLE ONE OF WHICH WAS FOR DELIVERY OF THE FOOD DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER BY THE AUTHORIZED ESTABLISHMENT OR FOR A THIRD PARTY DELIVERY SERVICE. AND THE FTA FOUNDER THIS WAIVER THROUGH THEIR PUBLIC PROCESS OF COMMENTS AND THAT THE WAIVER WOULD NOT RESULT IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF FOOD UNDER CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR HUMAN HEALTH OR CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THESE WAIVERS BECAME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN I'M SO WE CONTINUE TO URGE THAT CALIFORNIA IN THIS COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS BY THE FDA IN WHICH THEY FOUND THESE THIRTY THIRD PARTY GROCERY DELIVERY MODELS DO NOT RESULT IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF FOOD THAT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR HUMAN. HEALTH OR CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE BILL. HIGHER MARIN ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ALSO -- IN OPPOSITION FIRST WELL THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND AND HIS STAFF -- FOR HELPING THE THIS% BILL ALONG. JUST PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT AS SOME OF YOU -- IN THIS COMMITTEE MAY FOR A MAY RECALL A ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY ONE BY AS A MEMBER TONY THURMOND A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- THAT BILLS ACTUALLY COSPONSORED BY THE GROSS AND YOU'VE CW -- IT SOUGHT TO REQUIRE BLUE APRON EMPLOYEES TO GET FOOD HANDLER CARDS. AT THE TIME WHEN THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAID THAT WE DID WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH -- THIS THE UFCW AND IS A MEMBER THURMAN WAS TO TAKE OUT DRIVERS FROM THAT BILL -- THE UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT IT SHOULD ONLY BE THE FOOD HAVE A REQUIREMENT OF TRANSIENT ONLY BE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY HANDLING THE FOOD NOT TO THOSE WHO ARE DELIVERY BECAUSE AGAIN BACK THEN THE LOGIC WAS WILL THERE LITERALLY TAKING THE FOOD THERE. NOT UNLIKE A RESTAURANT DELIVERY DRIVER WHO BY THE WAY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL -- AS ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE POINT OUT THIS SOMEWHAT OF AN INCONSISTENCY WHICH I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT AS WELL. KNOWING THAT A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- THE SPONSORS AND AND US UNFORTUNATELY THE POSING NOW BUT WE WORK TOGETHER TO TO TRY TO CREATE A SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE. CARS ARE TAKING OUT WE ARE TWO YEARS LATER DRIVERS ARE BACK IN -- THAT BEING SAID I UNDERSTAND DOCTOR PAN WE ARE MEANS WITH YOU THAT THAT YOU SEEK SOME SORT OF OF OF MAC OR SOME SORT OF FRAMEWORK. FOR FOR THESESORTS OF OF DELIVERY DRIVERS. WHO I THINK -- AS COURT INDICATED WE'RE OPEN TO THAT AND AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION -- AND WE WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HAVE A WAY TO TO STRUCTURE SOMETHING THAT. KEEPS IN MIND THE FEDERAL -- WHAT'S GONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT ALSO TO KEEP IN MIND THE-UNIQUE SORT OF A BUSINESS MODEL THAT THESE FOLKS HAVE A REMEMBER YOU KNOW THESE -- INSERT CARD TYPE BUSINESSES BRING THE GROCERY STORE TO PEOPLE'S HOMES WE HAVE SENIORS WHO CAN'T GET TO THE STORE IN A BILL DRIVE PEOPLE ON A TRANSPORTATION. A LOT OF THESE IN SICKERT -- COMPANY TYPE COMPANIES ACTUALLY HELP THE GROCERY INDUSTRY BY TAKING THE GROSS STARTED THEM -- EFFORTS TO HAMPER THAT ACTUALLY I MEAN IT COULD HAVE LONG TERM HARM ON ON OUR INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO SHOP. AT GROCERY STORES AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO STILL COMPLETE THESE TRANSACTIONS EVEN IF THEY START ONLINE THROUGH MISTER CLARK THEY WILL STILL BE DONE AT GROCERY STORE A LOT AND UNION SHOPS WE DON'T WANT. THESE TRANSACTIONS GOING TO OTHER FOLKS -- WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFIT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE COMPANIES -- SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS YEAH WE'VE BEEN A WEEK WE AGREE TO CERTAIN POINT THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF MECHANISM AROUND THIS WE JUST ASKING FOR TIME TO WORK ON THAT AND AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHOR. WITH THE SPONSORS WITH THAT THE ESCROW FOLKS DR PAN YOUR STAFF WE'D LOVE TO HAVE THAT'S BECAUSE WE TOLD YOU WE'VE COMMITTED TO THAT -- AND I THINK IF WE HOLD THE BILL NOW POSSIBLY AGAIN I'D LEAVE IT UP TO THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT THIS BUT WE COME BACK IN IN JANUARY. BILLS NOT DEAD WE CAN WORK ON IT I MEAN YOU HAVE OUR COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT -- AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WE ARE I MEAN WE WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THE CHAIRS -- TO WISH TO GET SOMEWHERE HERE THERE IS SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE ON THIS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT -- YOU KNOW THROWING -- FOR SUGGEST AN IMAGE IN A WEEK FOR SOMETHING THAT THAT ARGUABLY SHOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR TIME TO TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND AND WORK ON POLICY -- WHICH IS WHAT THE MORAL HERE TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BEEN HAVING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. DO YOU FEEL ON BEHALF OF DOOR DASH IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION -- OUR POSITION GIVEN THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS AS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE JOINT LIABILITY FOR RETAILERS HAVING TO BE INVOLVED IN WAYS JUSTICE BETWEEN -- THE DELIVERY NETWORK FOLKS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES OF THE DRIVERS SO -- THAT'S WHERE OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY YES CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY COMMONSENSE BILL -- WHEN I STARTED AT ALPHA BETA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL A VERY LONG TIME AGO? I WOULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THAT GROCERIES WOULD BE DELIVERED TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE. AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO CHANGE WITH THE TIMES AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION WHEN THEY SAY WELL WE BRING IN THE GROCERY STORE. TO SENIORS ALL THE MORE REASON TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS THAT ARE DRIVING THAT FOOD KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT THAT RAW CHICKEN SITTING IN THE CAR FOR TOO LONG OR IT MIGHT SPOIL. IT'S THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW OR YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S A SANDWICH SHE BROUGHT FROM THE SERVICE DELI IN IT HAS MAY OWE ON IT AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO BE. IN THE CAR TOO LONG THE INSPECTION OF THE CAR ARE YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AT HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS. DON'T HAVE REAL RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION AND UNFORTUNATELY THESE INSTANT CARTON OTHER JOBS DON'T PAY A HIGH WAGE SO WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A CAR IS NOT GOING TO BREAK DOWN. GETS FIXED ON THE ROAD AND THEN THE THE FOODS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR AN HOUR OR MORE GETS TO PEOPLE AND IT SPOILED. I JUST THINK THIS IS A VERY COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO WITH THE CHANGING DYNAMIC THAT WE NOW LIVE IN SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AND MOVE IT WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU CENTER OKAY NO OTHER RIGHT -- SO I ALSO IS ONLY RETAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH WITH OUR OFFICE AND AND AND YOU KNOW WE REALLY DID HAVE A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH AT WOULD POINT OUT I MEAN I APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPONENTS SAID NO BRING THE GROCERY STORE TO PEOPLE'S. HOME AND GUESS WHAT WE HAVE A LOT OF REGULATIONS ON GROCERY STORES. RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE AN EXPECTATION TO GO TO GROCERY STORES FOOD WILL BE SAFE IT'S AT RIGHT NOW THE GROCERY STORES COMING TO THE HOME. NOW THIS LINK HERE AND IN FACT I YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE WE HAD THE DISCUSSIONS HE SAID WELL OKAY. THE GROCERY STORES HAVE. BUT THE REGULATIONS AND SO THEY WERE THE ONES DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELIVERY HAS AND THOSE REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THEM AND SO THEY AND WHEN THE GROCERY STORE COMES OF THE HOME. THEY'RE REGULATED THE PROBLEM IS NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER ENTITY. THAT THE GROSS FROM A CONTRACT WITH. BUT HIS RESPONSE OVER THE SEA LEVEL WHAT RULES THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW AND YOU KNOW WE WORKEDAND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH US IN THE SPONSORS. WE START THE FOOD HAMMER CARTY SAID WELL THAT'S NOT A PRO DOES MORE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE BUT WE RECOGNIZE I THINK IS MENTION BEFORE. YOU HAVE FOOD THAT YOU HAVE PERISHABLES -- YOU HAVE MEET YOU HAVE MILK YOU HAVE OTHER TYPES OF PERISHABLE FOODS AND SO IT'S THAT. AS A ONE X. SHOWS UP AT THE HOME IT NEEDS TO BE OF THAT QUALITY AND SO WE NEED TO BE SURE PEOPLE HAVE THAT EDUCATION SOBELL ONE FACT WE'VE PRETTY OPEN AND WE SAID THEY JUST NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS I THINK THERE'S WORDS. THIS IS BASIC FOOD SAFETY -- THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND WE TALK ABOUT RESTAURANTS YOU KNOW WHAT RESTAURANTS IS A DIFFERENT SITUATION THEY'RE PREPARED ENTER OUT WE CAN TALK OF INFLAMMATORY SAGE ABOUT RESTAURANTS LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION A RESTAURANT DELIVERY. BUT I THINK FLIPS THIS IS BILLS ABOUT GROCERIES YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHEN THAT FOOD SHOWS UP THE DELIVERY PERSON SHOWS UP AT THE HOUSE BRING THE GROCERY STORE TO THE SENIOR TO THE BIRDS IS DISABLED. AND THAT IS OF THE QUALITY THAT THEY SHOULD REASONABLY EXPECT AND THE SAFETY OF OUR POST MOST POORLY THE SAFETY SO I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH US -- ASSURE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK OF THE OPPOSITION BUT I I THINK THAT. THIS BILL SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND SO I ASK YOU. TO CLOSE THANK YOU SENATOR VERY JUST VERY VERY BRIEFLY ON THE BILL'S BEEN IN PRINT SINCE FEBRUARY WE'VE HAD.

THIS CRISIS IS EVIDENT WHEN PEOPLE CALL 911- AND FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS RESPOND TO MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE EMERGENCIES ONLY TO HAVE TO SIT IN THE PATIENTS TO IT OVERCROWDING E. R. WHERE THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE PROPER CARE AT THE PROPER TIME. A MEETING NINE ONE ONE USERS AREN'T ABLE TO RECEIVE TIMELY CARE BECAUSE OUR PARAMEDICS ARE ABLE TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH OR SOBERING CENTERS. COMMUNITY PER MEDICINES ALLOW -- OPS A SPECIALIZED TRAIN SPECIALIZED TRAINED PARAMEDICS TO PERFORM OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH THEIR TRADITIONAL ROLES TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR GUILDS LOCAL AGENCIES THE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS AND REQUIRE. THAT THE STATE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP A MINIMUM A MINIMUM A MINIMUM MEDICAL STANDARDS. IT'S A THOUGHTFUL BALANCED APPROACH TO GIVE THE LOCAL AGENCIES THE FLEXIBILITY NOT ONE UNDERSCORE FLEXIBILITY WHEN INSURING OF A HIGH STANDARD OF CARE IS MET IN EVERY PROGRAM THIS BILL IS RIGHT.

IT IS VOLUNTARY AND NO ONE IS EVER DENY CARE DIVERTING THESE PATIENTS FROM ET TO AN APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCE ALLOWS PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES TO RETURN SERVICE MORE QUICKLY. NEVER ITS PATIENTS WITH NO KEEP MEDICAL NEED FROM THE ET THIS GROUP OFTEN OVERLAPS WITH OUR SECOND PILOT WHICH IS FREQUENT USES A BE A MESS WE OFFER CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES WRAPAROUND CARE TO THOSE WHO CALL. THEM ONE FOUR TIMES IN A MONTH OR TWO TIMES IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS LAST MONTH IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO SIX HUNDRED AND THREE INDIVIDUALS MET THAT CRITERIA.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'VE COME ON AS A CO SPONSOR TO THIS BILL IT'S A LONG WAYS FROM THE POINT WHERE WE ACTUALLY OPPOSED TO THE PILOT PROGRAMS WHEN THEIR FIRST STARTED. BUT BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING WE THINK THIS IS A NICE MODEL THAT COULD BE ROLLED OUT TO THE STATE. AND SEE SOME EFFECTIVE RESULTS FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE OKAY. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NINE BACK BACK FROM OKAY I THINK THIS. ONE EFFORT WORRY FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

RIGHT SEEN OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE MAKE ROOM FOR THEM AT THE TIME [inaudible] OKAY. IT DOESN'T GO AWAY [inaudible] OKAY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STEPHANIE ROBERSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION -- RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL AND SIMILAR BILLS THAT WERE VETOED -- JUST ACTUALLY LAST YEAR A PLAIN AND SIMPLE MEMBERS WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE POLICY APPROACH AS AN ANSWER TO THE ISSUE OF OVERCROWDING IN OUR E. OURS AND SHOULD NOT BE A DETRIMENT. TO PATIENT SAFETY WE SIMPLY FLAT OUT DISAGREE WITH THE RESEARCHER REPORTS. THAT HAVE CAME OUT OF THAT PAIN A MUCH DIFFERENT PICTURE THAN WHAT WE ANALYZED. AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT I SCRUTINIZE THESE PILOTS IN EACH REPORT SINCE ITS INCEPTION. OF THESE PILOTS ALMOST SIX YEARS AGO THE REPORTS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A SMOKING MERE SCREEN THAT PURPORTS ALLEGED SAVINGS AND TREMENDOUS PATIENT SATISFACTION. IN FACT THESE PILOTS AND IN SOME CASES I HAVE HAD LOW PARTICIPATION IN IN THE BEGINNING MANY OF THESE PILOTS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT -- WE'RE NEEDING HEALTHY PATIENTS HEALTHY WHITE ENGLISH SPEAKING MALES NOT AT ALL REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA. SEVERAL PILOT SIMPLY SHUT DOWN BECAUSE MS COULDN'T MEET THEIR PRIMARY CONTRACTED JOB WHICH IS RESPONDING TO FIRES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES. IN THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO THEY SIMPLY PULLED OUT ALL TOGETHER CITING. BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SAVE MONEY OR IMPROVE CARE WE'VE ALSO WORK WITH THE CITY OF LONG BEACH WAS RECENTLY PUSHED BACK ON THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL. NOT TO MENTION LOOKING AT THE DATA IT HAS BEEN HARD FOR US TO TRULY ANALYZE THE RAW DATA FROM THE RESEARCH REPORTS THAT WE BASS WERE FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN TURNED OVER TO US SO IT IS IMPERATIVE AS A PUBLIC POLICY BODY FOR US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION OF THIS MAGNITUDE OUT HOW TRULY SHIFT. YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE -- IN TO PUT IT IN TRYING IN STATUTE WE NEED TO HAVE ALL THE FACTS AND WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THAT. I'M PATIENT SAFETY THERE'VE BEEN OVER THIRTEEN RESEARCH STUDIES THAT FOUND SIGNIFICANT RATES UP UNDER TRIAGE BY EMS PERSONNEL. THESE RATES ARE AS HIGH AS 32% ON TRANSPORTS TO ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS I THINK YOU HAVE SOME PAPERWORK IN FRONT OF HIM. I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW CAUTION EVERYBODY BEFORE YOU YOU KNOW MOVE ON THIS BILL THAT PATIENTS WHO CALL 911- ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CRITICAL CRITICALLY ILL AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. AT THE END OF IT ALL WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE USE OF PARAMEDICS AND FIRE TO BE USED OUT OF THE PRE HOSPITAL CONTEXT. AT REYES MOMENTS AGO THE REPORT THAT WAS WRITTEN IN RECENT YEARS BY. TWO PHYSICIANS OPPOSE ALTERNATE DESTINATION AND THEIR BOTTOM LINE WAS AND I QUOTE THE LITERATURE DOES NOT SUPPORT PARAMEDIC GUIDED DIVERSION OF AMBULANCE PATIENTS AWAY FROM THE E. D.. TO ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS IN TERMS OF ONE COST SAVINGS AND TWO OUTCOMES THIS IS OBVIOUSLY COMPLETELY ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE POST DISTRACT PILOTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED I WANNA. OBVIOUSLY THINK THE CHAIR FOR YOU KNOW HIS WORK ON THAT AND THE STAFF. SO YOU KNOW IN THE END THERE -- INTERIM THINGS THAT WE CAN DO -- THE ER DOCS AGAIN I I ALWAYS MENTION THIS THEY JUST GOT A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ITEM TO GET DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR IN THE ET THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FINDING RESOURCES AND MEETING THE PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE. YOU KNOW UP AND DOWN THE STATE THE OUR HOSPITALS ARE DOING BRACKET MEDICAL EVALUATIONS CUTTING DOWN THE TIME IN THE ER FROM FORTY SIX HOURS TO WANTED. TO SET THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW WE NEED TO HELP HOSPITALS BECOME A PARTNER BEAT OUT THE SEAT AT THE TABLE. AND THE ANSWERS AGAIN DO NOT NEED TO BE ON THE BACKS OF OUR PAY PATIENTS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UNDER SENATOR OF BONTA MEMBERS OF THE THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIAN ANDERSON AND I'M THE ABOUT THE MINISTRY FOR NAPA COUNTY AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND ZACH HAS TAKEN OPPOSE A MUST AMENDED POSITION ON AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR AND TO BE BRIEF ALL FOCUS ON TWO KEY AREAS OF CONCERN. FIRST AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR DOES NOT RECOGNIZE A LOCAL EMS AGENCIES EXISTING AUTHORITY TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO TREATMENT FACILITIES OTHER THAN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. THE EXISTING X. FORTY IS FURTHER CLARIFIED AND DRAFT REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE STATE EMS AUTHORITY EARLIER THIS YEAR. SECONDLY AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR GIVES PUBLIC AGENCIES THE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL AND THE NAPA EMS SYSTEM THIS COULD PROHIBIT US FROM USING OUR SINGLE COUNTY WIDE PROVIDER THUS ELIMINATING THE EFFICIENCY THAT THE LEGISLATION SEEKS. FURTHER THIS PREFERENCE TO A PUBLIC AGENCY IS GIVEN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY PROVIDE BASIC LIFE SUPPORT OR ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT SERVICES. AND DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE WHETHER THE AGENCY EVEN HAS AMBULANCE TRANSPORT CAPABILITIES. OVER APPRECIATE ON ONE OF THE KNOWLEDGE THE AMENDMENTS MADE TO HOSPICE -- THAT -- ALLOW THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS PARAMEDICS TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE PATIENTS -- TO PROCEED -- AS IT AS IT CURRENTLY DOES. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MY NAME IS SON CAROL SNYDER ON THE CURRENT EMS COMMISSIONER REPRESENTING THE EMERGENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA IN A HAS SUPPORTED THE CONCEPTS OF ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS AND COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINES. PROJECTS THEIR PROJECTS FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CAL IS THAT DID NOT SUPPORT THEM WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THE COLLABORATION. BETWEEN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND PRE HOSPITAL CARE AS WELL AS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN VARIOUS EMERGENCY CARE PROVIDERS. HOWEVER THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY UNDERMINE THESE EFFORTS BY CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF THE EMS COMMISSION AND REMOVING OUR SEAT FROM THE TABLE. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO OFFER GUIDANCE AND EXPERTISE ON A VARIETY OF EMERGENCY CARE ISSUES WHETHER IT INVOLVES STROKES AND SEMI REGULATIONS OR HOW TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL DESTINATIONS FOR TREATING VICTIMS. THE KELLY IN A IS BEEN WORKING TO AMEND AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR TO REMOVE THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD ELIMINATE OUR ROLE. IN THE M. S.
