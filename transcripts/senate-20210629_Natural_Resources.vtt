EXIST BUT WHENEVER YOU PROPOSE

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:45.950
PUTTING HOMELESS FACILITY IN

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:48.052
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. ABSOLUTELY

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:50.121
NOT I THINK ALSO OF

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:51.689
CALIFORNIANS ONE OF MORE

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:53.591
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT WHEN

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:54.926
YOU PROPOSE PUTTING AFFORDABLE

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:56.060
HOUSING NEIGHBORHOOD

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:58.496
NEIGHBORHOODS ABSOLUTELY NOT IN

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:02.967
MY BACKYARD TYPE OF IT FEELING.

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:05.003
AND THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:06.004
HERE IN GOVERNMENT THAT

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.306
WHENEVER WE TRY TO PROPOSE ANY

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.241
SOLUTION TO BRING. ARE

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:11.809
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THE STATE

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:13.144
THERE'S ALWAYS A GROUP THE

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.646
COMES OUT AND SAYS ABSOLUTELY

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:16.614
NOT WE CAN'T DO THAT I JUST

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:18.883
HAVEN'T FOUND A SOLUTION. THAT

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.419
MAKES EVERYONE HAPPY. BUT WE

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.554
HAVE ONE HERE THAT IS

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.522
COMPLETELY REASONABLE ONE THAT

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:25.823
YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT USED TO

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.992
ALREADY BE PART OF THE PROCESS

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:29.994
THE FACT THAT IT WAS REMOVED.

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.829
IT IS JUST A SAD PIECE OF

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:34.699
HISTORY IN OUR STATE THAT WE

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:37.001
CANNOT THAT THE COASTAL

00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:40.004
COMMISSION SHOULD NOT. INFORCE

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:42.140
PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:42.774
THE COASTERS ON WHAT HAS

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.710
HAPPENED. OUR COASTAL AREAS

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:47.812
HAVE BECOME LESS AFFORDABLE.

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:50.882
AND IN MANY CASES SOME SOME OF

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:51.749
THE SOME OF THE JOBS BE

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.384
PROVIDED IN THE COASTAL AREA

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:55.853
HAVE ALSO BEEN LESS WELL

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.757
REMUNERATED SO. FOUR FOUR COULD

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:01.226
COMMUNITIES ON THE COASTLINE

00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:03.328
THEY DEFINITELY PROVIDE A LOT

00:31:03.394 --> 00:31:06.197
OF LOW WAGE JOBS. BUT EVERY

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:08.633
SINGLE WORKER THAT COMES INTO

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.200
THE COASTAL ZONE COMES FROM

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:11.669
SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND THAT'S

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:14.405
DEFINITELY NOT GOOD FOR OUR FOR

00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:15.406
THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:17.909
DEFINITELY. NOT GOOD TO CREATE

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:20.278
AN EQUITABLE SOCIETY AND

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.547
DEFINITELY NOT GOOD TO. PROVIDE

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:24.315
PEOPLE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:25.083
LIVE WHEREVER THEY WANT TO LIVE

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:26.751
IN THE STATE. THAT'S JUST AN

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.186
ENORMOUS FAILURE OF OUR STATE

00:31:28.253 --> 00:31:30.054
GOVERNMENT IT'S UP ENORMOUS

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:32.890
FAITH- FAILURE OF HOW OF PUBLIC

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.726
POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:36.861
REALLY TO SEGREGATE PEOPLE IN

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.930
OUR STATE IN TWO DIFFERENT

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:41.032
NEIGHBORHOODS WE HAVE. HIGH

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:42.133
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOW

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.801
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN MIDDLE

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:44.902
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:47.505
CALIFORNIA JUST AN ENORMOUSLY

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:49.307
SEGREGATED STATE AND IT AND

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:50.575
IT'S BEEN IT'S VERY SAD AND WE

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:54.912
SHOULD AS POLICY MAKERS WORK.

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:56.014
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.081
WHEREVER THEY WANT AND THE

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.583
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT ONE ATTEND

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.753
AND GIVE THEM. THE OPPORTUNITY.

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:04.289
TO LIVE WHERE THEY WORK AND TOO

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:06.924
POTENTIALLY WALK TO WORK OR NOT

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:09.060
HAVE THESE ENORMOUSLY LONG

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:12.997
COMMUTES- SO. I APPRECIATE THIS

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:14.999
BILL I YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:16.734
ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:20.171
PROPOSED THAT THIS IS GONNA. A

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:21.706
CREATE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:22.740
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:24.809
COASTAL COMMISSION YES. THERE

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:26.644
ARE INCONSISTENCIES BECAUSE IN

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:27.912
MANY CASES THERE ARE LOCAL

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:29.847
GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE NOT

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:32.083
IMPLEMENTING THE COAST LACKED.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.318
THEY REFUSE TO CREATE A LOCAL

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:35.486
COASTAL PLAN OFTENTIMES WHEN

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:36.554
THERE'S A LAW ON THE BOOKS THEY

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.523
APPROVED PROJECTS TO DO NOT

00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:41.993
CONFORM THAT'S JUST. A FACT.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.928
AND YES THAT CREATES A CONFLICT

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.330
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:48.499
COASTAL ACT. REQUIRES LOCAL

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.133
GOVERNMENTS JUST DO NOT WANT TO

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.905
DO. AND IF YOU ASK ME AND YOU

00:32:53.971 --> 00:32:56.107
KNOW I HAVE SEEN VERY VERY

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:58.543
LITTLE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO

00:32:58.609 --> 00:33:01.045
BE BUILT IN THE COASTAL.

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:04.082
COASTAL ZONE. I HAVE WORKED.

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.783
AND SUCCESSFULLY TO CREATE

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.118
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:08.619
COASTAL ZONE BUT IT WASN'T

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.254
COMMUNITIES LIKE MARTY LOGAN.

00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.390
THAT JOB I HAVE OFTEN IN THE

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:14.158
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:16.160
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BUT

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:17.829
INDUSTRIAL USES AN AND PARTY

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:20.498
LOGAN WE HAVE TRIED TO. REZONE

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:22.300
AND CREATE A COMMUNITY THAT YOU

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:23.968
SEE AN AREA THAT USED TO BE A

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.703
COMMUNITY BUT THAT WAS ABSORBED

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.873
BY INDUSTRIAL USE IN AND BEFORE

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.607
YOU KNOW WE HAD JUNKYARDS AND

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:33.077
WE HAD. OF CHROME PLATING SHOPS

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:36.147
AND WE HAD- USES ADJUSTED NOT

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:37.949
MIX WITH RESIDENTIAL AND I

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:39.183
THINK THAT'S A CALIFORNIA STORE

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.985
IF YOU GO AROUND CALIFORNIA YOU

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:43.054
SEE WHERE. IF THEIR OWN ANY LOW

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.689
INCOME PEOPLE LIVE IN THE CLOSE

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:46.257
IT'S USUALLY IN VERY

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.359
CONTAMINATED COMMUNITIES IN THE

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:51.262
COAST A BUDDY IN INDUSTRY. AND

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:52.697
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.165
THINK WE CAN RESOLVE THIS BILL

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.401
COULD RESULT THAT HOPE OVER THE

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:57.235
NEXT FOUR YEARS I I'M

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:58.903
ENCOURAGED. THAT THIS BILL

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.338
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:00.938
I SERVED ON THE COAST

00:34:01.005 --> 00:34:03.007
COMMISSION. I WAS THERE SEVERAL

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:07.645
YEARS AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.913
MANY TIMES. IT WAS SIDE DURING

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.182
A HERE. THAT WE COULD NOT EVEN

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:12.917
DISCUSS AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:14.952
BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN STRICKEN.

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:17.522
FROM THE COASTAL ACT. AND HOW

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:24.395
MUCH OF A. FIVE A JUST A

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:29.133
HISTORIC. JUDICIARY OF DATA

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.935
THERE IS ON THE SUBJECT THAT'S

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:33.037
THERE IT'S AVAILABLE TO US NOW

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.139
IF THIS WAS REINSTATED WE CAN

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:37.675
GO BACK TO YEARS AND YEARS OF

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:40.978
CASE LAW RELATED TO AFFORDABLE

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:41.579
HOUSING IN THE IN THE COASTAL

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:44.215
ZONE. THAT WOULD HELP US TO

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:46.484
JUDICATA FUTURE HOUSING SO THIS

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:49.687
IS NOT ANYTHING NEW. IT WAS

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.489
SOMETHING THAT WAS A TOOL.

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:52.990
PROBABLY DIDN'T SOLVE ALL THE

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.425
WORLD'S PROBLEMS BUT IT SOLVES

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:57.195
SOME. AND THIS BILL WILL

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:59.197
PROBABLY NOT SOLVE ALL THE

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:00.298
WORLD'S PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.599
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.968
RESISTANCE TO ANY KIND OF

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:06.604
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE IN

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.372
THE IN THE COASTAL ZONE OR ANY

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:10.041
HOUSING WHETHER FORD WILL NOT

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:12.977
THAT HOUSES WORKERS MIDDLE

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:15.480
INCOME WORKERS OR EVEN. A LOW

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:18.549
LOW WAGE WORKERS ANYTHING THAT

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:20.318
RESEMBLES THAT WILL BE OPPOSED

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:21.018
TO THE CULTURES ON NO MATTER

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:24.388
WHAT LAW IS PUT INTO PLACE BUT

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:26.157
HAVING THAT I THINK WILL MAKE.

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:28.092
AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN THEM

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:29.861
THAT THAT WILL DISCUSSION WILL

00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:32.196
BE HAD AND IT WILL HOLD LOCAL

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:34.131
GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.666
APPROVING PROJECTS THAT KNOWN

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:38.069
NOT ONLY CONFORM TO THE STATE'S

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:39.804
AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:42.306
BUT THEN IT ALLOWS ANOTHER

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:44.475
JURISDICTION THAT HAS A LOT OF

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:47.078
INFLUENCE TO ENSURE. THAT LOCAL

00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:49.013
GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING THANKS

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.414
PRODIGIOUSLY TO CREATE THE

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.516
HOUSING THAT THEY PROMISED TO

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:54.385
PROVIDE SO I THINK THIS IS ONE

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:55.520
MORE FULL BILL I DON'T THINK IT

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:56.554
NEEDS ANYTHING I'D LOVE TO BE

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:58.189

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.552
WHAT'S NOT CLEARLY ARTICULATED.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.955

DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.131

REDUCED PERMIT TIME TO NEW THAT

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:52.370

DIEGO THE PART OF THE CITY THAT

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.145
IS INSIDE THE COASTAL ZONE WE

ABOUT 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.089
DEVELOPMENT IN MY ASSEMBLY

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:13.591

IS IMPORTANT TO YOU BUT THE

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:19.664
ADDITIONAL PART OF THE PROCESS

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.165
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A CD P.

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.933
REVIEW. THEY KNOW THAT TAKES

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.101

RE. BECAUSE THEY BACK LAW

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.757
WITHIN OF STAFF TODAY. BUT

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:48.025
THESE ARE VERY SIMPLE. TYPES

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:49.527
THAT WE KNOW HELP CONTRIBUTE.

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:50.961
TO THE HOUSING STOCK THAT WE

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:51.495
NEED FOR MIDDLE AND LOWER

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:53.230
INCOME CALIFORNIANS THEY OUGHT

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:55.099
TO BE EXPEDITED. AT THE TOP OF

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.534
THE COASTAL COMMISSION THEY

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.102
SAY. REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE.

00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.372
VOTER AND ENTITLED MANDATES TO

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.573
REALLY PROTECT OUR COASTAL

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.708
RESOURCES PROTECT COASTAL

00:39:03.774 --> 00:39:05.209
ACCESS BUT FOR ME WHEN I'M

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:06.277
HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:07.411
THEM. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:08.713
VISITORS SERVING ACCOMMODATIONS

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.548
AS A LAND USE BODY. THAT

00:39:10.614 --> 00:39:11.549
ALREADY HAS REGULATORY POWERS

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.483
IT'S IMPORTANT THEY'RE

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.452
BALANCING RESIDENTIAL INTEREST

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.821
THERE- FOR HOW WE ARE MAKING

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:18.656
SURE. THAT THE POSTAL ON

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.424
DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH EVERY

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:21.826
CITY OR EVERY JURISDICTION

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.661
SHOULD BE SUBMITTING AS WELL.

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.229
ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:27.998
UNDERLYING CITY ZONING SITTING.

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:30.301
HOUSING ELEMENTS SO. I THINK

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.103
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL ON

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:33.871
TIME I CHECK AND BALANCE THAT

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:36.307
WE HAVE FOR SPECIAL ZONE OF OUR

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:38.309
STATE. HE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.644
TOTALLY. ADDRESSES IT WILL BE

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:43.147
TRIED A DIFFERENT WAY. BECAUSE

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:46.217
IN MY HOME AREA IF SOMEBODY

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:48.152
DOESN'T GET WHAT THEY WANT.

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:50.154
THEY USED A LOCAL COASTAL PLAN

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.322
TO APPEAL IT TO THE COASTAL

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:52.690
COMMISSION AND DRAG OUT THE

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:55.259
DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S NOT IN

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.927
THIS FOR EIGHTY USER OTHER

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:58.896
THINGS NOW. BUT IT WILL HAVE

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:01.999
THIS. HOW ARE YOU CONFIDENT.

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.168
THAT THIS WILL EXPEDITE AND NOT

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.736
ALLOW PEOPLE ANOTHER BITE AT

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:07.071
THE APPLE TO DELAY AFFORDABLE

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:08.539
HOUSING. OKAY THAT'S WHAT I

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.441
DON'T UNDERSTAND CLICK USE AS A

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.742
SENATOR SO IT MAY NOT BE IN THE

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.611
ANALYSIS BUT IT IS IN THE BILL.

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:16.013
IN ON PAGE SEVEN THAT ACTUALLY

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.249
DOES DIRECT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:19.817
TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE THEIR-

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.519
THEIR STREAMLINED PERMITTING

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:22.853

AFFORDABLE UNITS. AND SUPPORT

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:27.491
OF HOUSING UNITS AS WELL. SO

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:33.964
SHALL. BE PROCESSED BY THE

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:34.999
COMMISSION AND DOT WITH RESPECT

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:35.733
TO ONE OF THE ARE. TESTIMONY I

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.367
HAPPEN WORKING WITH FOR SOME-

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:37.868
MONTHS. THERE IS ACTUALLY L.

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:38.836
DIAZ FOR TWO THINGS ONE OF

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.671
THOSE IS HERE IN THE BILL WHICH

00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:41.772
REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:42.940
PROCESS AND APPROVING THEM IT

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:43.774
WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT

00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.676
SPECIFIED. IN CERTAIN SECTIONS

00:40:45.743 --> 00:40:47.578
OF THE OF THE CODE ON SO THEY

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:48.646
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.514
IS A GUARANTEE AND THIS CASE IS

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.515
A LINES WITH THE COASTAL

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.017
COMMISSION'S ASSESSING PROCESS

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:55.252
TO PROCESS- THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.220
SAYING. I THINK THAT THERE'S

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.055
ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE BUT

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:00.024
YOUR BILL IS LIMITING HOW THE

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.660
BITE AT THE APPLE CAN BE TAKEN

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:03.761
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I'M NOT

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:05.963
SURE I STREAMLINING OR LIMITING

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.565
THE NUMBER OF TIME I'M TRYING

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.700
TO GET. AT WHAT. I DO KNOW BE

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:10.768
WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THIS

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:12.303
LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO.

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.704
PROMOTE A STREAMLINING OF

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.072
CERTAIN HOUSING NO NO I KNOW

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:16.407
THAT I KNOW THAT AND THAT

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:18.542
EXISTS IN LAW. RIGHT AND YOU

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:19.643
ARE ADDING ANOTHER PIECE OF THE

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.045
LAW THAT EXISTS IN LAW FOR

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:22.813
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IT DOESN'T

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.682
EXIST FOR THE- FOR THE COASTAL

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.317
DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCESS OR

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.918
LOCAL COASTAL PLAN. YES AND BUT

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.887
MY QUESTION IS ONE IT NOW WOULD

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.922
EXIST IF WE APPROVE THIS BILL

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.524
FOR THE LOCAL COASTAL PLAN.

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:35.726
DOES THAT IS THAT CONSISTENT

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:37.061
WITH THE STREAMLINING AND

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.896
DOESN'T GIVE SOMEBODY A BITE AT

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:40.364
THE APPLE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:42.032
NOW TO DELAY THE HOUSING. THAT

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.801
IS OE. AND WHEN I THOUGHT I

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.736
HEARD YOU SAY. IS THAT YOU UP

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:46.904
SOMETHING IN THE BILL THAT

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.606
LIMITS THE ABILITY AND TIME

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.708
LINES. TO APPEAL OR DO

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.843
SOMETHING WHICH- WOULD MAKE THE

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.612
CASE THAT YOU'RE LIMITING THE

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.013
ADDITIONAL BITE OF THE APPLE

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.048
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU HERE.

00:41:58.115 --> 00:42:00.084
AND I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.051
TELL US CLEARLY HOW THAT'S

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.853
TRUE. I THINK IT IS TRUE

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.754
BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHAT THIS DOES

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:05.456
IS THIS PACKS BUT I AM REQUIRES

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:07.524
THE COMMISSION TO PROCESS THESE

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:09.393
MOD MINISTERIAL LEE. OUT WITHIN

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.197
A SPECIFIED TIMELINE. THE AND

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:15.599
IS THAT A CITY PERMIT WITH THE

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.434
COASTAL OVER LIFE GENERATES

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.737
EXPEDITING VAT. IT'S NOT ADDING

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:22.239
A SECOND COASTAL STREAMLINING.

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:23.974
THAT IS ADDITIONALTIME EVEN

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.409
THOUGH IT STREAMLINED RIGHT AND

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:26.577
BACK TO MY CITY OF SAN DIEGO

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:27.845
EXAMPLE THAT WAS THE PROBLEM

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:28.979
WITH MANY HOMEOWNERS AS THEY

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.347
KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:31.882
TO POSSIBLY A ONE OR TWO YEAR

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.784
ON STAFF FOR YOU BECAUSE

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:34.952
THEY'RE STILL BACK LOG. ON BUT

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:36.020
WHY SHOULD I GO TO THE BACK F

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:37.521
THE LINE THESE ARE EASILY THERE

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.223

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:47.464
AND THEN THERE'S- I'M I'M GONNA

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.332
TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD ON THAT

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:50.134
THE TO THE SECOND ISSUE IS

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.669
THERE'S A UNIQUE THING IN THE

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.771
COASTAL ACT. AND IN THE PROCESS

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:55.606

PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. WELL I

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:43.847
WOULD SAY- THE EXISTING LAW

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:46.316
COVERS THAT- IF THERE'S A WAY

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:47.718
TO POTENTIALLY ADD SOME

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:48.986

CENTRAL ISSUE HERE. AND I THINK

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:17.047

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.519
NOT AN IMPEDIMENT- BECAUSE I

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:23.854
JUST WATCHING IT JUST HAPPENED

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.889
WITHIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING-

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:27.458
PROPOSAL IN THE CITY OF SANTA

THE COMMISSION ON A HIKE LIMIT

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.230
BUT THE HAWKS TAKING EIGHT FEET

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:34.898
DOWN WOULD HAVE STRIPPED THE

00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:37.034
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM THE

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:39.937
PROJECT AND SO. IT I'M JUST

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:41.672
CONCERNED THERE'S NOT SOMETHING

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:44.475
IN IT FOR IN THIS BILL THAT IS

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:46.543
AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.612
IT IS ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.380
FOR PEOPLE THAT. WANT TO GET IT

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:53.083

ON HE WILL CONSIDER THAT AND I

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:57.621
THINK. I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:59.056
LOOK AT HOW THIS IS IMPLEMENTED

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:01.191
IF IT IN FACT PASSES TO MAKE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.193
SURE THAT THE UNINTENDED

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:06.263
CONSEQUENCES TO NOT. COME TO

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:10.767
AFFECT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.336
THING YOU LOOK AT IS JUST

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:14.872
PEOPLE USING. AMANDA SAN

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:17.274

SHOULD RELOCATE TO SAN JOSE

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.212
THAT WAS NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:26.416
ISSUE. IT SO I'M JUST CONCERNED

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:28.152
THAT PEOPLE WOULD USE THIS IN A

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:30.154
WAY THAT HAS THE OPPOSITE

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.990
IMPACT IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:35.559
THAT SO. YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:37.027
SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I THINK

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:39.463
THAT'S THE PRISM WITH WHICH-

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:40.898
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THIS AS IT

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:43.267

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:52.743
WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE BILL

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.778
WILL IF IT MOVES FOR TODAY IT'S

00:46:54.845 --> 00:47:02.219

THAT NOTHING IN THIS MEASURE AS

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.546
I UNDERSTAND IT- CONTRAVENES

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:31.448

THAT NOTHING IN THIS WOULD

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:52.636
CONTRAVENE THOSE PROCESSES

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:54.438
IMPEDING ACCESS FOR INSTANCE IT

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:00.043
ONE OF THOSE OTHER. KEY SORT OF

IS THE MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.515

REALLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK. IS

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.364
NOT REAL- AND THEN WE END UP

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.399
WITH. THE POOREST COMMUNITIES

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.334

HEAT REDUCTION OR THE IMPACTS

AND I'M HOPING THAT THE THIS

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:33.796
PROGRAM WILL BE THEN

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.064

CONNECTED TOGETHER I GUESS THIS

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.546
IS DEFINITELY THE BEGINNING OF

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:52.615
COORDINATING THESE ALL OF THE

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.650
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND EFFORTS

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:57.252
THAT THE STATE RUNS TOWARDS

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.888
REDUCING HEAT- RURAL

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.191
COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE.

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:05.661
IT IS NOT ONLY FOR URBAN AREAS-

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.062
INTO THESE THOSE ARE GREAT

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.631
POINTS THAT YOU'RE MAKING AN I

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:10.899
DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU- AND

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:12.735
THAT'S MY INTENTION OF THAT

IN THIS GRANT PROGRAM ARE ALSO

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.714
PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:28.450

OR LIKE URBAN GREENING- AND SO

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:33.656
IT IS UP TO THE LOCAL. ENTITIES

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:37.259
TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ON WHAT

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.327
THEIR NEEDS ARE. BUT I WANT THE

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:41.130
STATE TO ALSO- YOU KNOW PROVIDE

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:44.233
ASSISTANCE AND EXAMPLES OF WHAT

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:46.435
CAN BE DONE AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.771
LISTED SOME OF THESE. PROGRAMS

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.839
ARE TECHNOLOGIES IN THIS BILL

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.409
THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED- IN A LIKE

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.644
FOR EXAMPLE COOL PAVEMENTS AS

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.212
US SOMEONE MENTIONED IN THE

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:59.982
TESTIMONY. IT IS NOT REQUIRED

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:03.419
BUT IT IT'S A WAY TO. UP TO LET

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.554
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS KNOW THAT

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.189
THIS IS ONE AREA THAT THEY CAN

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:10.225
FOCUS ON. IF THEY'RE NOT AWARE

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:12.461
OF THAT TECHNOLOGY OKAY. SO I

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:14.096
GET TO DO. THE ONE THING I JUST

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.564
ALWAYS TRIED TO RESIST IS THAT

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.398
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SHE

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:17.499
COULDN'T CREATE ANOTHER SILO

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:18.534
THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.568
ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT PEOPLE

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:21.403
HAVE TO APPLY TO INDIVIDUALLY.

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:22.504
PERSON BEING ABLE TO SAY HERE'S

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.473
OUR PROBLEM WHAT DO WE WHAT WE

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.009
QUALIFY FOR- AND THEN THIS IS

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.177
NOT YOUR ISSUE BUT I THINK IN

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:29.712
ALL OF OUR BILLS GOING FORWARD

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:30.779
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.548
BUILD AND- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.683
FROM THE STATE. ON THAT ACTUAL

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.119
GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS. WHEN

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.153
YOU KNOW WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.089
CREATED THERE WILL BE. AN

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:42.024
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:44.860
COMMENT ON WHO SHOULD APPLY AND

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:49.398
HOW AND SO THAT'S BUILT INTO

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:52.167
THIS. PROGRAM AND I WOULD JUST

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:53.702
ADD A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ALSO

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:55.871
DO AUTHORIZED TECHNICAL

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:58.941
ASSISTANCE- BOTH FINANCIAL AND

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.576
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.311
ELIGIBLE ENTITIES AND THEN THE

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:04.813
REPORT JUST TO BE CLEAR IS IT

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.949
IT'S NOT AN ANNUAL REPORT

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.984
THERE'S A ONE TIME IN JULY

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.653
TWENTY THREE. BUT THE ACTIONS

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.488
THAT THEY'RE ANALYZING

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.356
INCLUDING ASSESSMENT OF ALL

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:17.659
STATE PROGRAMS- SO THAT'S ON

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:20.729
PAGE SEVEN EIGHT IF THAT- YES

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.297
SIR JUST TO WATCH THAT

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.166
INCLUDING UNMET GAPS POTENTIAL

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.402
GAPS- IN THE STATE'S APPROACH-

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.571
BUT I AGREE THAT EQUITY. REALLY

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:31.707
NEEDS TO ALSO BE A DRIVING

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:33.709
FORCE HERE AND I KNOW THAT'S

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.043
THE HEART OF YOUR COMMUNITY TOO

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:38.213
SO- I THINK IT'S AND WE'RE

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.281
GOING TO SEE A BILL A LITTLE

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:40.816
LATER TODAY AND BILLS IN THE

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:42.584
NEXT TO ME HEARING IS A LOT OF

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.486
OVERLAPPING WORK GOING ON IN

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:45.554
THE ADAPTATION OF RESILIENCY

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.623
SPACE SO THE IDEA OF COHESION

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.091
HEARING YOUR CROSS REFERENCE TO

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.526
THE OTHER PROCESS HE'S I THINK

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.294
IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. TO

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.595
SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA THERE'S

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.697
A STATE WIDE PLAN IN THIS SORT

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:56.799
OF ASSIST WITH LOCAL

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.000
GOVERNMENTS THEN THERE'S GOING

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.568
TO BE GRANDSON URBAN GREENING

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:02.004
BUT AGREED GETTING ALL THAT TO

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.906
WORK ONE FRONT DOOR WILL BE

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.073
REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW CENTER

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.475
GROVE HAD A COMMENT AND THEN

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:09.545
SENATOR JONES. SAWYER GROWTH.

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.247
THANK YOU MISTER. SO I THINK

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.683
ROSHI BUYER EXPERIENCES IN LIFE

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.652
AND OBVIOUSLY KERN COUNTY HAS

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:19.254
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES THAN LA-

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:23.258
THE COASTAL AREA AND- BEING A

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:25.294
BUSINESS OWNER IN WHAT I CALL

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.296
THE REAL WORLD. WE ALWAYS TRY

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.263
TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ROOT

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.898
CAUSE ANALYSIS IS LIKE WHAT'S

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.167
THE ROOT CAUSE FOR EXPENSES TO

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:34.136
GO UP FOR WHAT'S THE ROOT CAUSE

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:35.971
FOR THE INJURY TO TAKE PLACE.

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.139
AND THEN IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THE

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.041
ROOT CAUSE THEN YOU DON'T HAVE

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:41.276
TO HAVE A THE CONTINUOUS

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:43.412
BANDAID OR A FIX IT ON ON

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:46.849
WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS. SO FIRST

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:47.916
OF ALL TO SAY THAT I DO BELIEVE

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.551
IT'S FILLED ENERGY POLICIES IN

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:52.221
THE STATE M. BECAUSE THAT

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:54.723
BECAUSE- ELECTRICITY RATES TO

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:55.624
GO SO HIGH YOU KNOW

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:56.792
CALIFORNIANS IF YOU LOOK AT IT

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:58.460
I THINK IT'S TWENTY TWO CENTS.

01:14:58.527 --> 01:14:59.995
IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:01.029
NATION'S IF NOT THE HIGHEST IN

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.698
THE NATION'S SO WHEN YOU LIVE

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:03.832
IN AN AREA IN THE CENTRAL

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:06.435
VALLEY LIKE MYSELF FOR- MY

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.036
COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON. AND

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:09.271
WE'RE DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.573
CHAIRMAN AND HERE BECAUSE WE

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.441
CAN'T JUST OPEN A WINDOW AT

01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:15.444
NIGHT AND- HAVE YOUR BREEZE

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.044
BLOW THROUGH AT OUR HOUSE GETS

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:22.618
CALLED OFF. PARDON ME. OKAY M.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:26.188
SO M. I JUST THINK THAT- IF

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:27.856
ELECTRICITY RATES WEREN'T SO

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:28.423
BAD AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.359
HIGHEST- YOU KNOW POOR

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:31.560
DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.662
FARMWORKERS PREDOMINATELY

01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:34.563
LATINO POPULATION IN THE

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:36.632
CENTRAL VALLEY THAT- YOU KNOW

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.267
CAN'T AFFORD AN EIGHT HUNDRED

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:39.735
DOLLAR A MONTH UTILITY BILL OR

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:40.535
SEVEN HUNDRED OR MONTH UTILITY

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:43.538
BILL SO- I THINK THE ROOT CAUSE

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:45.240
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THE

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.109
COST IS THE COST OF UTILITIES

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.945
BUT IN THE MEANTIME. I THINK

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.514
THAT- YOUR BILL DOES DO SOME

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.449
GOOD RIGHT FOR THE TO THE GRANT

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.651
PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE PEOPLE TO

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:58.020
APPLY FOR THEM SO THAT- YOU

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.121
KNOW IF COUNTIES OR CITIES

01:15:59.187 --> 01:15:59.988
WANTED TO PUT TOGETHER SOME

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:02.257
STUFF IT WOULD BE- YOU TO BE

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.625
BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY FOR THE

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:04.860
AREAS THAT WE CAN APPLY FOR THE

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:06.261
GRANT FROM PROGRAMS THAT YOU

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:10.799
HAVE IN THE BILL- I APPRECIATE

PAVE AN ISSUE. BECAUSE AGAIN IN

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.809
THIS BUILDING WE TEND TO LOOK

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.177
AT THINGS FROM A TEN THOUSAND

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.845
FOOT VIEW. AND WE THINK THAT.

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:25.447
IF WE DO THIS IT WILL FIX THIS

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.648
BUT WHEN IT'S IN THE REAL

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.951
WORLD. N. LIKE MR SIEVERS

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.919
ASCRIBE YOU KNOW THE REFLECTION

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.421
OF THE PAVEMENT COULD CAUSE THE

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:35.324
BUILDINGS. TO BE- THE HARDER TO

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.492
COOL IN THE SUMMER TIMES- EVEN

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:39.361
THOUGH IT'S A GOOD CAUSE TO

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.630
HAVE LOWER HEATED AND- THAT

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:44.366

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.143
WAS PRETTY DEVASTATING NOT ONLY

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:58.813
FOR. THAT BEAUTIFUL AREA UP

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.848

ARRANGING FAMILIES THAT AT

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:13.728
LEAST WITH THE FOR SERVICE AND

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:14.595
JUST TO GET IN AND GET THEIR

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:16.330
CATTLE OUT AND- YOU KNOW A

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:17.565
GROUP OF PEOPLE LEFT KERN

YOU KNOW WE'RE ANIMALS GO RIGHT

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:30.478
WHEN THAT HAPPENS. AND I'VE

01:32:30.544 --> 01:32:32.947
OFTEN ADVOCATED FOR UNIFICATION

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:35.483
MANAGEMENT AND PRESCRIBED BURNS

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:37.351
THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE- YOU

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:38.920
KNOW CAMPING UP THERE FOR YOU

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:41.055
KNOW SINCE I WAS A KID- AND MY

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:43.724
MOM AND DAD BEFORE THAT- YOU

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.126
KNOW EAST BILL TO GO TO OUR

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:46.260
CAMPSITE A WALK DIRECTLY TO THE

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:48.529
LAKE. AND NOW YOU CAN'T DO THAT

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:50.231
M. YOU HAVE TO WALK ALL THE WAY

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:51.966
AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.201
VEGETATION ON THE GROUND- AND

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:56.337
SMALL TREES THAT YOU CAN'T GET

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:57.872
TO THE LAKE. AND I THINK THAT

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:01.142
JUST- PER VOIGTS KINDLING AT

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:03.077
YOU KNOW FUEL FOR THESE FIRES

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.278
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAD

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:05.713
SUCH A DEVASTATING LOSS WITH

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:08.215
THE CREEK FIRE. SO I REALLY

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.617
APPRECIATE YOUR BILL AND THANK

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:13.554
YOU M. FOR BRING IT FORWARD.

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:15.623
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SCHERING.

LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.560
AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.395
EVERY. TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX AND

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:23.030
I THINK PRESCRIBERS HAVE NOT

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:24.265
BEEN USED AS MUCH AS WE KNOW

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:26.133
HISTORICALLY IT'S- IT IS A WAY

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.235
TO KEEP WORKFORCE CLEAN- I.

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:29.737
ALSO HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:30.471
IN THE AREA WHERE THE CREEK

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:32.673
FIRE OCCURRED AND WE LOST MY

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.942
DAD SOLD OFF THE GRID CABIN.

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:36.677
AND CHOSE NOT TO EVEN THINK

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:37.678
ABOUT REBUILDING AS A BURN TO

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:38.813
THE GROUND JUST BECAUSE THE

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:41.115
DEVASTATION IS SO MASSIVE THAT.

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:41.816
I DON'T THINK IN MY LIFETIME

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:44.318
THAT AREA. WE'RE WEEK WHERE WE

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:45.486
HIKED AND FISHED WELL WE'LL BE

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:47.621
BACK. IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:49.390
ENJOY IT. SO I THINK IT'S

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:51.125
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I HOPE

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:52.126
THAT WHEN THE PLANS ARE

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:55.196
DEVELOPED ACTUALLY ENCOMPASS- I

01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:58.833
MEAN REALLY LOOK AT THE AMOUNT

01:33:58.899 --> 01:33:59.600
OF SPACE THAT NEEDS TO BE.

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.302
CUPBOARD AND ENTREATED. AND

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:03.204
THAT IT IS ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.839
PROTECT LARGER. AREAS I THINK

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.540
SOMETIMES WE DO IN SMALL PATCH

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.142
AREAS WHICH ISN'T AS EFFECTIVE

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.710
SO. HOPEFULLY WILL MOVE TOWARDS

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:11.846
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. THAT

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:13.581
WILL INCLUDE ALL ALL PROPERTY

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.249
OWNERS AS IT GOES FORWARD.

FOR A WHILE. WE HAVEN'T TALKED

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:28.896
ABOUT THAT CRITICAL MODEL

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.398
COMPONENT OF YOUR LEGISLATION

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:31.699

SORT OF THAT ROLE OF MODELING

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:43.244

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.588
IS ALSO. AN IMPORTANT TRUST

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:55.589
BUILDING EXERCISE IN THE

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:56.991
CERTIFICATION PROCESS HE'S

01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:57.958
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET PEOPLE MORE

01:34:58.025 --> 01:35:01.228
COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT. THIS CAN

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:04.098
DO- BUT IT DOES NOT. EXPRESSLY

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:06.367
DOES NOT CONTRAVENE ANYTHING IN

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:07.868
EXISTING LAW THE WAY THE

INVASIVES COME BACK IN SO. IN

01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:19.647
AREAS. WHERE THERE ARE AT THE

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:21.449
CHAPARRAL AND COASTAL SAGE

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:23.651
SCRUB. IF YOU PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:35:23.717 --> 01:35:25.219
THAT AND THEN IT COMES BACK AS

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.387
MUSTARD WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:40.835
COMPLEXITY I THINK ASTUTELY SO

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:42.937

OF IT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.374
FRAMEWORK THAT DOESN'T

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:49.376

THAT'S WORKING IN THE SPACE.

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:03.924
BUT WE THINK THESE EFFORTS ARE

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:05.158
ULTIMATELY COMPLEMENTARY AND

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:06.059
THAT THERE COULD BE LOTS OF

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:07.627
EFFORTS ON PARTICULAR THINGS.

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.196

WE CAN FOCUS ON THE POLICY AND

01:46:15.635 --> 01:46:17.204

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:19.840
THE TOP LEVEL SO THAT ALL OF

01:46:19.906 --> 01:46:20.907

ABOUT. SHOULD THIS BE HOUSED IN

THIS IS ULTIMATELY SO IN MANY

01:47:25.705 --> 01:47:27.073
WAYS THE STRATEGIC GROWTH

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.708

THE CONVERSATION. THE FLIP SIDE

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:09.449
OF IT IS. IS IF EVERYBODY SORT

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.051
OF HAS A LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY

01:48:11.117 --> 01:48:12.085
NOBODY HAS THE ULTIMATE

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:16.089
RESPONSIBILITY AND- YOU COULD.

KNOWLEDGEABLE AS- AS THE FINE

01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:25.158
SENATOR FORMER SECRETARY. SO

FEEL LIKE WE- FOLLOW THROUGH

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:36.169
WITH REAL OUTCOMES. WHY IF WE

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:37.570
ALREADY HAVE. MANY PEOPLE

WANTS THAT WE'VE SEEN TO THIS

01:49:51.584 --> 01:49:54.154

01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.691
IMPORTANT WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE

01:49:57.757 --> 01:50:00.226
VERSUS BEGINNING SOMETHING NEW.

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:01.428
YEAH IT'S A GREAT POINT SENATOR

01:50:01.494 --> 01:50:02.896
AND I THINK THAT THE THRUST OF

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:05.165
THIS BILL IS TO IS TO MOVE FROM

01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:06.800
PLAN INTO ACTION RIGHT AND THAT

01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:07.567
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD WORK

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:08.668
THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE SPACE

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:09.602
BUT HOW DO WE TAKE IT TO THE

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:10.503
NEXT STEP HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.771
THAT WE HAVE. MEASURABLE

01:50:11.838 --> 01:50:13.506
DEMONSTRABLE OUTCOMES THAT ARE

01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:14.040
GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:15.809
FORWARD HERE- THEY WERE VERY

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:16.576
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:17.777
TO DO WE WANT TO DO THAT IN A

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:18.878
WAY THAT SENSITIVE TO ALL THE

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:19.679
WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE

01:50:19.746 --> 01:50:21.715
HERE- GOING BACK OVER OVER A

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:23.183
DECADE AND BUILT ON THAT

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:24.351
DOESN'T RECREATE THE WELL BUT

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:25.552
LEVERAGES WHAT WE'VE BEEN DONE

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:26.753
AND REALLY YOU KNOW AT SOME

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.321
SOME SOME TEETH AND SOME HAVE

01:50:28.388 --> 01:50:29.122
TO IT AND MOVED IT TO THE NEXT

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:30.790
LEVEL. SO THAT IS A THAT THAT'S

01:50:30.857 --> 01:50:32.559
VERY MUCH THE INTENT HERE AGAIN

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:33.727
I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THIS IS

01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:35.562
IMPORTANT BURKE- AND THIS BILL

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:36.930

THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO.

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.805
IS BE CREATING MORE FRAMEWORKS

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:47.707
AND STRATEGIES THAT THAT THAT

01:50:47.774 --> 01:50:48.775
WOULD THAT WE NEVER ACTUALLY

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:50.744

02:04:43.442 --> 02:04:45.778
INTO THE L. A. RIVER PROCESS

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:50.082
FOR THE FIRST TIME. OKAY

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:53.786
ACTUALLY WE- AFTER ALLEN HAD

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:55.287
STATED WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR

02:04:55.354 --> 02:04:57.356
ALMOST TWENTY YEARS ARE OVER

02:04:57.423 --> 02:04:59.892
TWENTY YEARS- SO IT'S TIME TO

02:04:59.959 --> 02:05:01.660
UPDATE OUR OPEN SPACE PLAN WE

02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:02.761
ARE CURRENTLY UPDATING OUR OPEN

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:04.430
SPACE PLAN ALSO KNOWN OF COMMON

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:05.831
GROUND WITH INCOMES FROM OTHER

02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:08.033
CONSERVANCY DUE TO THE MULTI

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.602
AGENCY EFFORT TO UPDATE WILL

02:05:09.668 --> 02:05:11.203
INCLUDE METROPOLITAN AREA DARK

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:13.205
CURLY NOT PART OF OUR TERRITORY

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:15.040
WHAT'S IN. THE UPDATE WILL

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:16.375
REVIEW FUNDING ABOUT

02:05:16.442 --> 02:05:18.043
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:19.645
ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE AREA

02:05:19.712 --> 02:05:22.081
WHICH INCLUDES THE EXPANSION

02:05:22.147 --> 02:05:25.751
THE EXPANDED AREA OF DIMMING OF

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:26.919
CHANNEL AND CATALINA ISLAND. I

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:28.554
THINK THAT WAS A YES BUT I'M

02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:32.191
NOT ENTIRELY SURE. IT YEAH BIG

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:34.460
BIG BECAUSE- THE ISSUE IS

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:35.995
THERE'S AN ELABORATE PLANNING

02:05:36.061 --> 02:05:37.529
PROCESS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:39.999
IN HISTORY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

02:05:40.065 --> 02:05:41.767
TO SENATOR STERN'S DISTRICT.

02:05:41.834 --> 02:05:43.035
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:45.137
THE LOWER PART OF THE RIVER WAS

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:46.972
INVOLVED AND GOT OUT AHEAD OF

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:49.808
THE PLANNING AND SO. I'M JUST

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:52.645
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF. IF THE

02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:54.713
AREAS ADDED WERE INVOLVED AND I

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.981
THINK YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE

02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:57.349
GOING TO BE INVOLVED IF THEY

02:05:57.416 --> 02:05:59.285
WEREN'T INVOLVED ALREADY. THE

02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:00.986
COULD SECOND QUESTION I HAD IS

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:02.922
I HAVE A VAGUE RECOLLECTION

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:04.156
THAT THERE WAS A PRIVATE

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:06.058
CONSERVANCY THAT EXISTED FOR

02:06:06.125 --> 02:06:08.294
THE CAMERA WE CATALINA ISLAND

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.729
OR OUT THERE. IS THIS

02:06:10.796 --> 02:06:12.531
COORDINATING WITH THAT PRIVATE

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:15.000
CONSERVANCY IS IT SUBSUMING IT

02:06:15.067 --> 02:06:16.735
IS THERE SOME RESOURCES THEY

02:06:16.802 --> 02:06:18.270
BRING TO THE TABLE IT MIGHT

02:06:18.337 --> 02:06:19.605
COME TO RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS IF

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:24.343
THIS. IF THIS BILL PASSES. VERY

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.045
GOOD QUESTION WE HAVE ACTUALLY

02:06:26.111 --> 02:06:28.113
MET WITH THE CITY AVALON AS

02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.448
WELL THE CATALINA CONSERVANCY.

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:32.117
THE CATALINA CONSERVANCY IS A

02:06:32.184 --> 02:06:32.718
NONPROFIT THAT IS NOT A STATE

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:35.387
AGENCY. SO WHAT THIS EFFORT

02:06:35.454 --> 02:06:37.189
WITH OF EXPANSION WE'D BE ABLE

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:40.993
TO. ASSIST EACH OTHER- ON

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:42.361
EITHER EXPANDING OR

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:45.864
REVITALIZING THEIR HABITAT ON

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:47.533
THAT ISLAND. AND THEN WHAT I

02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:51.170
WOULD SUGGEST TO THE AUTHOR- IS

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:53.839
DEAD HE ACTUALLY BE EXPLICIT

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:55.407
ABOUT WHAT COORDINATION IS

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:57.676
GOING TO BE SO THAT THIS BILL

02:06:57.743 --> 02:06:59.445
DOESN'T PASS AND THE NEXT THING

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:00.112
WE KNOW THERE'S SOME

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:02.014
NEGOTIATION GOING ON THAT COULD

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:04.149
HAVE HAPPENED AT THE TIME WE

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:06.251
WERE DOING THE BILL SO I WOULD

02:07:06.318 --> 02:07:08.921
JUST SUGGEST THAT THE AUTHORS.

02:07:08.988 --> 02:07:09.755
HAVE THOSE KIND OF

02:07:09.822 --> 02:07:11.657
CONVERSATIONS AND CLARIFY THAT

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:13.659
BEFORE THE BILL'S DONE A WITH

02:07:13.726 --> 02:07:16.795
THAT. A MISTER CHAIR OUT

02:07:16.862 --> 02:07:18.130
THERE'S A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS

02:07:18.197 --> 02:07:19.398
THERE BROKE WITH THAT I'LL BE

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:21.066
READY TO MOVE THE BILL WHENEVER

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:24.803
BUT DISCUSSION IS. DONE GREAT.

02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:26.472
GREAT THANK YOU- AND JUST TO

02:07:26.538 --> 02:07:29.341
CLARIFY- THE DOMINGUEZ CHANNEL

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:30.943
IS NOT A PART OF THE L. A.

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:32.745
RIVER IT'S WEST OF THE RIVER

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.546
THERE IS A TRIBUTE TO THERE IS

02:07:34.613 --> 02:07:36.515
A- PROBLEM LET ME TELL YOU. MAY

02:07:36.582 --> 02:07:38.717
TELL YOU THAT FIRST BILL THAT

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:40.486
THAT PASSED DIDN'T INCLUDE

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:42.488
TRIBUTARIES AND THEN I HAD A

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:44.323
NUMBER OF SENATORS SOME OF

02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:45.724
WHICH I AM SERVING WITH NOW.

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.559
LAND ON ME TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:47.626 --> 02:07:48.994
TRIBUTARIES WERE ADDED TO THE

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:50.929
BILL AND SO EVEN THOUGH IT

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:52.898
MIGHT JUST BE A TRIBUTARY IT'S

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:54.333
LIKE I'M TRYING TO PRESUPPOSE

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.902

ON SOME BUT YET I'M JUST NOT

02:07:58.437 --> 02:07:59.938
