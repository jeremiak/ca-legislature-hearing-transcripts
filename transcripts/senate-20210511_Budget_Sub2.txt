ANYTHING TO ADD ON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PROGRAM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE- THAT THE SEEDS PROGRAM I THINK THAT STATE. THE CATCH THE PROBLEM HERE RIGHT. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD THIS KIND OF THE REQUEST FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF THE SYSTEM WAS NOT PART OF THE BUDGET REQUESTS THAT WAS PART OF IT YOU CAN GOVERNOR JANUARY BUDGET AS- DIRECTOR BOEING AND MENTIONS AND SO. WE DO THINK OF THAT THAT KIND OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO THE MAINTENANCE OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM. OKAY CAN YOU THINK OF FOR- AB EIGHT FOUR ONE. THE. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS IT SEEMS REASONABLE. YES WE DO FINANCE YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD HERE. FIVE M.

YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- CHAIR WE HAVE DONE A LOT ABOUT REACH ON THIS TOPIC WHICH- HOSTED A COUPLE WORKSHOPS TO GET INPUT FROM OF COURSE THE SCHOOLS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED- COULD BE RECEIVING FUNDS BUT ALSO FROM- FROM LABOR FROM ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY FROM A VARIETY OF. SOURCES AND SO YES WE THINK THAT THE VENTILATION- WILL WILL IMPROVE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY VENTILATION AND INVITED COVE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT ALSO IN MANY CASES. WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE UNITS THAT PROVIDE VENTILATION. A LOT OF THESE UNITS ARE OLD AND THE FIRST TRANCHE OF FUNDING IS FOCUSED ON- TAKING A LOOK AT THE AT THE UNITS THAT ARE INSTALLED IN SCHOOLS PREFER WORKING PROPERLY. BRING THEM UP TO SPEED IF NEED BE AND THEN WILL BE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL CRUSHES THE FUNDING GOING FORWARD AND THEN THE PLUMBING- WATER IS THE CONSUMPTION THE DELIVERY CONSUMPTION AND TREATMENT OF WATER. ON THE BACKEND. IS AMONG THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA SO TO THE EXTENT WE REDUCE THAT TWO FIXING LEAKY PIPES WE WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCED. ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THANK YOU A CENTER DOLLY. HOW MUCH OF THE- HAS THE CC ALREADY TO THREE TO THE SEED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT IN TOMORROW'S FUNDS BEING READ DIRECTED FROM.

PROGRAM SO LET'S MOVE TO THE LA YO PRESENTATION ON THE SENATE SOME- CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS AND HIGH I WOULD LIKE FOR ALL THE SECRETARIES ON THE LINE AND PEOPLE THIS IS I'D LIKE TO HAVE A THEME YOU KNOW FROM THE TURTLE SONG BACK IN THE SIXTIES YOU KNOW HAPPY TOGETHER RATHER THAN THE FRANK% SINATRA I DO IT MY WAY ALL RIGHT AND I KNOW I KNOW FRANKIE IS A FAVORITE WITH EVERYBODY. AND WE LIKE IT MY WAY BUT I'M THINKING HAPPY TOGETHER SO MISTER BROWN YOU'RE ON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AGAIN ROSS BROWN WITH THE L. A. O. COMMITTEE STAFF HAS ASKED US TO PRESENT THE SENATE DEMOCRATS TALKING TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. I WOULD JUST OUTLINED IN THEIR AGENDA- AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER EVERY SINGLE DETAIL BUT BY JUST SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS AND BACKGROUND. THE FIRST SOME BACKGROUND- AS YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER IN LIGHT OF THE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY LAST YEAR OF THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED ONLY LIMITED GIGI R. F. FUNDS MOSTLY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS SOME WILDFIRE ACTIVITIES AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- AND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR INCLUDED. A ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING PLAN THAT SPANNED OVER BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS THE BUDGET YEAR SO I WAS KIND OF A TWO YEAR PLAN- SINCE THAT TIME THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED ONE PIECE OF THE CURRENT YEAR PLAN IF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED WHICH WAS THE- ADDITIONAL HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILDFIRE- THIS PART OF THE WILDFIRE PACKAGE EARLIER THIS YEAR- BUT IT'S STILL NOT ADOPTED A COUPLE SCHOOLS- SCALE KIND OF CURRENT YEAR PACKAGING SO THAT KIND OF BRINGS US TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND AS YOU CAN SENIOR GENDER THE SENATE PLAN- WOULD ALLOCATE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO G. R. US- THAT TOTAL AMOUNT IS BASED LARGELY ON- SOME OF OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WE SHARED WITH- WITH THE COMMITTEE ARE INVITED TO THE SENATE. WHICH ARE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN THE GOVERNOR CHANDERI BUDGET OVER THERE TWO YEARS OVER BUT THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR. THAT'S BASED ON RESULTS FROM SOME OF THE MOST RECENT AUCTION IN FEBRUARY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE RECENT MARKET TRENDS- AND IS ASSUMES ESSENTIALLY I'LL BE ALLOWED TO SELL AT THE MINIMUM PRICE WHICH IS KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH- COMMENTS ORACLE TRENDS. NOW AS YOU KNOW A LARGE CHUNK OF THAT ADDITIONAL REVENUE UNDER CURRENT LAW GOES TO GENERAL'S APPROPRIATIONS AND SO THAT LEAVES A SMALLER CHUNK FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BUT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AVAILABLE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES. I SO BASED ON THAT WE DO THINK THAT- ABOUT OE FOUR BILLION. TO BE ALEX- BASED ON ADDRESS ASKING WHILE ALL MAKING. A VERY REASONABLE AND HEALTHY RESEARCH WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT GIVEN THE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE SENATE PLAN INCLUDES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT NUMBER WE PROVIDED- AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT PROPOSES TO USE SOME OTHER FUNDS OR- STEVEN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. WHICH FREES UP ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION SO LIKE THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU TO THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TOTAL NUMBER. SO THE- REAL QUICKLY I WANT TO JUST SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL MAJOR CHANGES IN THE PACKAGE RELATIVE TO THE PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD EARLIER IN THE YEAR- ONE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME SHIFTS AND EXPENDITURES- TO OTHER FUNDS WHETHER THEY BE GENERAL FINDS FEDERAL FUNDS OR OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN FUNDING THE SHIFTED. AWAY FROM GRS TOWARDS- TOWARDS GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS THAT AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUNDS. THE FARMER PROGRAM AS YOU DISCUSSED AS PART OF YOUR AG PACKAGE WOULD BE SHIFTED TO GENERAL FUND. ON IT SO IT THIS FREEZE UP SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR US SPENDING IN OTHER AREAS THAT WEREN'T INCLUDED- OR AT LEAST- INCREASING FUNDING- IN AREAS OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED AND SO. THE MOST KEY AREAS OUR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION- THE SENATE PLAN INCLUDES. ONE BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FOR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION THAT'S OVER TWO YEARS- NOTABLY IT INCLUDES- FUNDING FOR US YOU B. R. P. YOU CAN BE A CALL REBATE PROJECT WHICH WAS NOT PART OF THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- TWO ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR LOCAL ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING PROGRAMS. TO SUPPORT THE GOALS ESTABLISHED BY S. S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. WHICH WAS NOT I CAN NOT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. OTHER BRAVE OTHER ALLOCATIONS TO OTHER PROGRAMS INCLUDING COASTAL RESILIENCY LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENTS- NOTHING REDUCTIONS WETLAND RESTORATION AND FINER RESEARCH SO I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THOSE BUT THEY'RE NICELY LAID. OUT ON THE TABLE IN YOUR AGENDA. I JUST WANT I WANT TO BEFORE. AND IN MY CAR HERE- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. A THAT THIS IS A CENTRAL. A ONE POINT BILLION DISCUSS PACKED. ACTUALLY TWO YEARS OF DISCUSS FUND SOME- FULL SCALE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING PLAN WAS NOT ADOPTED AS PART OF THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AND SO. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY FUNDING AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR LONG TERM PLANS. IS LIKELY TO BE BACK. UP TO AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS DOLLARS. ANNUALLY AND SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN THINKING ABOUT. LONG TERM PLANNING FOR HOW MUCH DISCRETIONARY FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. SO I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THIS BROWN COULD YOU. ON THE IMPACT THIS SPENDING PROGRAM WILL HAVE ON CARBON REDUCTION I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES WE GET INTO AIR POLLUTION. DISCUSSION OTHER INTERNAL LOTS OF DEMANDS FROM PROGRAMS IF PEOPLE WANT BUT BUT- PUTTING IN FOR INSTANCE ON THE ON THE CAL RECYCLE ON THE ORGANIC WASTE A TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHAT. WHAT COULD WE ANTICIPATE FOR THE ACTUAL CARBON IMPACT THAT THAT TYPE OF- EXPENDITURE PLANNER. BUT POTENTIAL EXPENDITURE PLAN. YEAH I DON'T I MEAN I DON'T THINK- WE HAVE ANY KIND OF- SPECIFIC OUTCOME QUANTITATIVE SORT OF OUTCOME MEASURES BASED ON THE PLAN THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO US BUT- CLEARLY- SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND METHANE IS A- SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF THE STATE'S OVERALL EMISSIONS AND- LOOKING AT THE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN THAT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD PUT TOGETHER. METHANE EMISSION REDUCTIONS BOTH ON THE VERY SIDE AS WELL AS THE WASTE SIDE- ARE A LARGE CHUNK ABOUT A THIRD OF KIND OF THE EXPECTED EMISSION REDUCTIONS KIND OF NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS SO THAT'S A BIG. BIG CHUNK OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED AND SO- YEAH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT PART OF THE PLAN SORT OF TARGET STATEN OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH STATE BUDGET SUPPORT IS NEEDED VERSUS JUST SORT OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS BUT- I'M CLEARLY IT'S SORT OF TARGETS ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF- OF EMISSIONS IN THE STATE AND- ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE STATE HAS FOR ACHIEVING ITS- ITS CHARTERS. AS BEEN AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A COUPLE EXECUTIVE ORDERS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY ONE FOR. A COMES UP IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR A MILLION CLEAN CARS ON THE ROAD IS HAVE CARS AND THEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION A COUPLE OF GOVERNORS. HAVE HAVE- THOSE ARE AS GOALS. THIS TYPE OF FUNDING PLAN. WITH THE CALM. OF THE MEDIUM SIZE TRUCKS THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES. I PRESUME IT GETS US CLOSER TO THAT GOAL DO YOU WANT TO. GIVE US YOUR CRYSTAL BALL OF THE IS THIS THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO HELP WITH THE MARKET PLACE AND CONSUMERS. ARE HELP US ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S WE HAD KIND OF A- FAIRLY LENGTHY DISCUSSION IN A- JOINT HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO- YEAH THESE ARE THE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT OUT ARE ARE. QUITE AMBITIOUS AND SO- WILL NEED TO BE KIND OF A LOT OF STATE POLICIES. IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE AMBITIOUS GOALS- I THINK MORE FUNDING KIND OF IN A LOT OF THOSE AREAS CAN BE ONE PIECE OF THAT. PUZZLE I THINK. THE CHALLENGE COMES IN AND KIND OF YOU KNOW HOW HOW THOSE POLICIES IN THAT BUDGETS ARE GONNA RACKS WITH. REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES FIT TOGETHER SO THAT MAKES THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES IT. DIFFICULT TO KIND OF. PUT A QUANTITATIVE NUMBER ON KIND OF EXACTLY THE SORT OF. HOW FAR THIS FUNDING MOTORISTS AND WHAT OTHER KIND OF POLICIES AND ACTIONS ARE NEEDED BUT- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY SORT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING SUPPORT IN A LOT OF THESE AREAS- CAN KIND OF HELP US GET. AT LEAST PART OF HE WAY THERE. OKAY TODAY I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH NOT GOING TO GET ON TO SECTORS BECAUSE THEY TOO BUT- YOU KNOW THE- THE- GOING BACK TO THE- THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS I KNOW WE HAVE SOME MONEY. WHICH WE'VE GOT SOME NON ATTAINMENT AREAS THAT THAT THE FIRE SERVICE ON THE PRESCRIBED BURN PROGRAM IS ALWAYS YOU KNOW. A BALANCING ARE WEGET A BI IS. HERE QUALITY COULD BE AT SUCH A- POSITION THAT WE'RE TO BE ABLE GO FOR. WITH A PRESS. BURN VERSES. BECAUSE OF THESE YOU KNOW POLLUTING. LANDFILLS ARE POLLUTING CARS AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT THAT THEY DID NOT A TEAM AND- KOCIAN IS SO HIGH THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT IS DOES ONE YEAR INVESTMENT. HELP US REACH THAT YOU KNOW BRING THOSE. ARE HERE CALL THE NUMBERS DOWN SAID THAT THESE CARBON REDUCTION MEASURES CAN GO FORWARD DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION ON THAT IS THAT I MEAN IS THAT A GOOD BLUEPRINT THAT WERE. WHAT ARE THINKING HERE IN THE SENATE. I'M I'M- I THINK KIND OF ANYTHING TO- KIND OF HELP CONTRIBUTE TO SORT OF THE STATE CAN SORT OF REGIONAL EFFORTS TO BRING SOME OF THOSE LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS DOWN IS- IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN AREAS AND STYLES- YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS I THINK IT IS IT'S KIND OF DEVELOPING A COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN A FOR PLANETS ALWAYS SORT OF A- A BALANCE OF KIND OF YOU KNOW CARBON REDUCTIONS IN FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON CARBON REDUCTIONS AND KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER GOALS THAT THE- THE STATE'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE SORT OF SPEND. ENOUGH TIME LOOKING AT KIND OF THE SENATE PLAN AND KIND OF HOW IT SORT OF BALANCES THOSE TWO THINGS ARE KIND OF YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINKING AROUND SO YOU KNOW THE SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED BUT I'M HAPPY TO KIND OF DISCUSS IT MORE AS CONVERSATIONS GO FORWARD- AND CHAT WITH YOU AND STAFF ABOUT KIND OF SEE HOW TO PROCEED WITH THE SENATE SCHOOLS ARE EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT LET'S OF LET'S GO THE ADMINISTRATION SECRETARY BLUMENFELD SECRETARY ROSS SECTOR CROWFOOT SECTOR BLUMENFELD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO. LEAD OFF. ABSOLUTELY J. THAT- CHAD- MEMBERS THANK YOU TO THE- SPEAK. MY NAME IS GERMAN CHILD I'M THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION- THE STOCK- SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU THAT HAPPY TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE LOW CARBON. TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AS THE L. A. O. JUST DESCRIBED AS- THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT PROGRAM SOMEWHAT CLOSE TRAINING. AND FROM MITIGATION AND RESILIENCE PROGRAMS AND- HOPEFULLY- WORKING HAPPY TOGETHER SHORTLY I WILL I WANT TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE SIX SEVENTEEN- I'M RATIONALE AND- AND TALK A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ADDRESS. DIVING INTO AS IT RELATES TO ADD POLLUTION- AS YOU KNOW JUST TO RECAP THE CAP AND TRADE HAS GENERATED ALMOST THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE AUCTION PROCEEDS TO FUND THESE CRITICAL CLIMATE. INVESTMENT PROGRAMS OVER THE YEARS AND CHANGES TO YOUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND THE DIRECTION TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS AND DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS ENVISAGED IN SB. FIVE THIRTY FIVE IN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY DIRECTING PROJECTS TOWARDS THESE COMMUNITIES IS A KEY OBJECTIVE OF THE FILES. WE CONTINUE TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHER NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL CLIMATE PROGRAMS BY EMPHASIZING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND EQUITY IN PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. AND THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROJECT BUDGET PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION SAID COMMUNITY AFTER SEXUAL PROGRAMS CREATED TO EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN. THESE REDUCE EMISSIONS IN COMMUNITIES WITH DISPROPORTIONATE EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION YOUR TARGETED MONITORING COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION. FUNDING FOR LOCAL AT DISTRICTS. AS WE WORK TOWARDS ACHIEVING CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MAINTAIN AN INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH TO OUR PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THOSE PROGRAMS THAT DELIVER MULTIPLE BENEFITS THAT CAN REDUCE CLIMATE IMPACTS IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY AND HEALTH AND OPTIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES. TO ACHIEVE EQUITABLE OUTCOMES IN DECISION MAKING. THIS APPROACH IS KEY NOT ONLY TO OUR PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND DOLLARS IT ALSO UNDERLIES OUR BROUGHT A FUNDING STRATEGY INCLUDING THE MAY. REVISED TO BE ANALYSIS THURSDAY. WHEN WE CAN BEFORE YOU A MARCH WE DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED G. ACTION RESTAURANT. ADVISE ACT AND JUSTICE PROTECTING HEALTH AND DRIVING COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING OUR EFFORTS TO ADVANCE EQUITY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THE PROGRAM ENABLES RESIDENTS TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE DESIGN OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION STRATEGIES FOR THAT COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND SCOPING PLAN PROCESS SEES. THE COR PAPPAS AT EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN REMAINS AMBITIOUS TO ELIMINATE DISPARITIES AND AIR QUALITY WHILE ACHIEVING FEDERAL ACT COOL BUT THE STANDARDS CURRENTLY SIX OF THE NATION'S TEN CITIES OF THE WEST EQUITY ARE IN CALIFORNIA. PROVING ARE AREAS WITH A FIFTY IS STRUGGLE AND IT'S ONLY WITH THE RECENT PASSAGE OF SIX SEVENTEEN AND A COMMUNITIES NOW HAVE A REAL SEAT AT THE TABLE. TO ADD QUALITY PLANNING. THE ROAD AHEAD WILL NEED TO QUICK NO. THE COMMUNITIES WE PRIORITIZE EXPERIENCE POOR AIR QUALITY POLLUTION BUTTONS AND OFTEN BROWN RIPPLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. BECAUSE OF THE PERSISTENT DYNAMICS AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL FOR WHICH THEY NEED OUR SUPPORT. COMMUNITY MEMBERS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PARTNERS CONTINUE TO EXPRESS HOW CRITICAL IT IS TAT COPY INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT WE PRIORITIZE ACTIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS THAT GO BEYOND INCENTIVES. COBBS ROLE IN DELIVERING SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES ENGAGE IN THE SIX SEVENTEEN ACTIVITIES IS KEY TO ACHIEVING THE PROGRAM'S GOALS. AND THE PROPOSED TWENTY TWO STOCKS ARE INTEGRAL TO BUILDING TRUST AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL ELEVATING COMMUNITY PRIORITIES TO THE AD DISTRICTS. AND THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THOMAS DASCHLE WE ASK THAT YOU RECONSIDER THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE CONTINUING RESOURCES REQUIRED TO REALIZE THE FULL PROMISE OF THIS CRITICAL AB SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM. WHICH LIES AT THE CROSSROADS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CLIMATE CHANGE. RETAINING THIS PROGRAM AS PART OF A I ESQUE PHOTO OF INVESTMENT SENDS TWO IMPORTANT MESSAGES. REINVESTING IN THE LONG TERM SUCCESS OF SIX SEVENTEEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE GLOBE. AB POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. A TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. ON OUTSIDE OF IT TODAY EXECUTIVE OFFICER EACH CHIANG MATH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE JOHNSON THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT A LACK IN IMPLEMENTING SIX SEVENTEEN ABOUT OUT PROPOSED EXPENSES BECAUSE- THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE POINTS I'M ALSO AVAILABLE. TIMES ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR ME I GUESS I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T AIR POLLUTION PROGRAM THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A 100% BEING PAID FROM A CARBON REDUCTION AND- I GUESS THE- THE- THE IDEA HERE IS. TO BALLENSTEDT YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT MONEY IN THE AIR POLLUTION FINE YOU GOT MONEY- IN THE IN. THE LOCAL THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS I AM NOT. THIS YEAR'S THE- SAYS FOR ONE YEAR PAID OUT OF THESE OTHER FUNDS. OBVIOUSLY NEXT YEAR WE HAVE TO COME BACK BUT IF THE GOAL IS AIR POLLUTION. AND WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL SECRETARIES AND TECHNICAL PEOPLE ADMINISTRATION FOLKS WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CARBON REDUCTION. AND POLLUTION IN PUBLIC HEALTH WHY IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION NOT SHIPPING IN SOME MONEY TO HELP OUT WITH THIS OUTREACH PROGRAM PROGRAM'S FIFTEEN GAUGE. PEOPLE I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A QUESTION OF THE BALANCE OF WHAT PORTION OF IT IS CARBON REDUCTION I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S NO CARBON REDUCTION BUT A LOT OF IT IS. IS YOU KNOW FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE BUDGET IS TO FOR HIRE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT. PERSONNEL IN BLIGHTED IT WHEN. WHEN YOU COME THAT CLOSE TO THE CHARGE OF. THE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. WELL AT TUESDAY'S VISIBLE AND THE OTHER RELATED TO AIR POLLUTION- AND YOU CAN DENY THIS BUT I THINK JUST FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS REITERATING- THE MAJOR CLEAN AIR ACT LANDMARK DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT WAS TO DECIDE THAT CABIN WAS INTACT AND POLLUTION THAT REQUIRED- ASKED TO REGULATED UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT- SO I DEFINITELY SEE CABIN AS ABSOLUTION- AND AS A AS A POLLUTANT I'M IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL AD DISTRICTS ROLE- AND IS. REGULATE STATIONERY'S OF POLLUTION. MANY OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE BOTH- CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND CARBON POLLUTION AND IN THAT LOCAL AREA- WHAT WE FOUND. IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE INSPECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ARE SUFFERING TODAY FROM ABSOLUTION- IN THE FORM OF ASTHMA IN THE FORM OF INCREASED MORTALITY. FROM PM TWO POINT FIVE- AND A LOT OF THE SAME SOURCES ALSO AS SOURCES OF CARBON POLLUTION SO OFTEN. AS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT DIFFICULT TO DETACH- AND UNNECESSARY IN MANY CASES TO SAY THIS DIESEL TRUCK- IS. ALLUDING JUST DIESEL THE TICKET WHAT MATTER ALSO. A LEADING COMPING COLLISION INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO WE THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY INNOVATIVE WAY OUT AN IMPORTANT WAY TO USE TEACHER AT FUNDING. THE ROLE THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD BOARD PLACES CRITICAL. IN THAT IT IS A VERY DECENTRALIZED CHAD- DECENTRALIZED. WAY IN WHICH GOVERNMENTS HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA- NO NO WHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY HAS THIRTY FOUR AT DISTRICTS- AND AN AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND A COUNTY PA WE HAVE A LOT A LOT OF GOVERNANCE AND A LOT OF GROUND THAT NEEDS TO BE COVERED. AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE DECISION MAKING RIGHT. IF WE COME OUT WITH CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE OR NOT INVOLVING LOCALS. FROM THE EARLIEST STAGES IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE RULES- WE RUN THE RISK OF US NOT INVOLVING THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE. THE MOST VULNERABLE TO CRIME AND OTHER IMPACTS SO YEAH I THINK IS A VERY VALID- USE OF G. FUNDING- ASPECT GIVEN. THE GENESIS OF THE MOST RECENT ITERATION OF HOW SHE- FUNDING CAME IN BEING- AND AS IT RELATES TO THE COP STAFF I THINK. THEY THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING US TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. YEAH I JUST I JUST WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT OTHER AGENCIES WHO CONTRIBUTE TO WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS IN THIS- A DESIRED OUTCOMES SHE NEEDING KICK IN A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY FROM THEIR BUDGETS IN ORDER TO GET ENTERING. I MEAN WHETHER YOU HAVE KICKED THE COMMUNITY ENGAGED OR NOT IF YOU PUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO MAKING YOUR GREEN WASTE WORK RIGHTS YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE EMISSIONS WHETHERPEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT OR YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT OR HAVE. A PARTY ABOUT IT IF THAT IF THOSE INVESTMENTS GOING TO LOW INCOME AREAS AND THEY ACTUALLY SEE THE MEASURABLE REDUCTIONS OF METHANE OR THE BILLION DOLLARS FOR AUTOMOBILES AND- TRUCKS THOSE ARE GOING TO AFFECT THE PORTS SEEK YOU CAN'T SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY ON HIGH HEAVY TO. MEDIUM SIZE VEHICLES OR TRUCKS AND NOT PRODUCE IT SO IT'S THE OUTCOMES I THINK WE'RE ON THE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH ITS THE PATHWAY THAT WE GO. AND WHETHER THIS PROGRAM PAYS THE ENTIRE NOT OF THE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S IMAGINABLE THE PEOPLE COME UP WITH. VERSUS YOU KNOW COMMUNITY OUT REACH. THE PUBLIC HEALTH THESE OTHER THESE OTHER PROGRAMS- LESS. OKAYED CENTER DOLLY YEAH WE DID I DIDN'T HEAR THE SECRETARYSHIP SOME SORRY WELL I WANTED TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON YOUR- TAT. YOU'RE QUESTIONING EXPECTS ON AND IF I COULD. UNDER THIS SECTION IT IS KEPT AS IT'S CALLED IN LEAST ON WHAT I HAVE AVAILABLE TO ME. EQUITY PROGRAM SO FAR I'M TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND. ACTUALLY HOW IT'S GONNA WORK WHAT TELL CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY GROUPS IS AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE CARBON IN THAT AREA I MEAN WE HAVE. WE KNOW- THAT YOU KNOW IN THE VALLEY THAT THERE'S AS AS MENTIONED BY THE SECRETARY THAT- WE HAVE THE WORST AIR INS ARE SEVEN OF THE TEN I THINK WERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY GONNA. WORK ON THE GROUND THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ON. HOW IT'S GONNA WORK AND HOW IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY REDUCE CARBON IN THOSE AREAS AND POLLUTION. LIKE GET A SATURDAY HOME MEET I'M HAPPY TO GIVE A SCENARIO SAYS. UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT- THE NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AS SET BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND- UNFORTUNATELY SHE- KLEIN SAYS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THE SOUTH COAST DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES MOST OF METROPOLITAN ADELAIDE. THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE AT QUALITY STANDARDS- THE STATE IS OBLIGATED TO COME OUT WITH. A REGIONAL ASH SAID- PLANS CALL TO STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. THOSE PLANS LOOK AT THE ENTIRE REGION SO TO YOUR CLIENT. LET'S FOCUS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THERE'S A PLAN THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. THAT THAT- BOARD. APPROVES A GIVE AND GOES TO. THE STATE AND THEN GOES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ONLY LOOKS AT. REGIONAL ACTIVITIES AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. HEALTH BENEFITS TO LOCAL DISADVANTAGED ENVIRONMENTALLY JUSTICE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES ARE NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION SIGNIFICANTLY IN THAT REGIONAL. ASSET PLANNING PROCESS AND SO SIX SEVENTEEN- WHEN IT WAS PASSED- WHAT. LED TO THAT AND DISTRICTS. WITH THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK TOGETHER WITH AND FIND LOCAL COMMUNITY PLANNING GROUNDS TO SAY HOW CAN WE- REDUCE. AND ACHIEVE THESE ATTACK HOLDING CLIMATE GOALS WHILE ACTUALLY HELPING THE NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE IS A SENSE THAT IT WAS JUST REGION OVERLY REGION LIES- AND- BACK. I MET YOU KNOW IS THIS GLOBAL ISSUE HOW WE- HOW LOCAL P. SET AS IT'S INCLUDING IN THE GO OF APTLY IN COBB REDUCTION. THE NEEDS OF LOW COMMUNITIES AND THE CAPACITY TO ACT HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO PLAN- THOSE CHANGES SO I'LL I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE THE. CHEN SAYS WE ALL AGREE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE- SPENDING FOOD WASTE WHICH EMITS METHANE TO THE LEFT AND STILL- IT ALSO- CAUSES ALL KINDS OF OTHER ISSUES BUT- MAKING SURE THAT. FOR INSTANCE THE TRUCKS OF THE DRIVING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY ON THE WAY TO THE LEFT AND STILL ARE ALSO CLEANED OUT THAT THE COMMUNITIES INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PARKWAY OF THAT TRUCK LOOKS LIKE HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED- THOSE WOULD JUST DRIVING RIGHT THROUGH ALL PARKING THOSE- FLEET OF RESCUE RESCUES VEHICLES IN LOW INCOME THIS IS NOT AS COMMUNITIES AS KIND OF CONCERNS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED AND OTHERWISE WE HAVE HUGE BACKLASH TO THESE PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT WE'RE RESULT RESULTING IN THESE REDUCTIONS BUT IN FACT. WE THAT HAVE COMMUNITY STANDING UP AND SAY ACTUALLY WE DON'T LIKE THE WAY THAT THE SUIT SCRAPS OF BEING BROUGHT TO THIS BY LARGE DISTANCES OF THE WE NEED TO CHANGE THEM AND WHEN YOU DO THAT AFTER THE FACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DESTRUCTIVE AND MORE EXPENSIVE SO BY INTEGRATING THE VOICES OF COMMUNITIES EARLY ON WE BUT IT'S GET REDUCTIONS THAT HELP WITH HEALTH. HELD REDUCE IMPACTS- AND MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE SUCCESSFUL SO HAVE YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- THE DISPLACEMENT THAT MEANS I KNOW THAT. WHEN I WAS ON THE SIERRA CONSERVING. THERE IS MANY STUDIES THAT IF YOU TOOK. EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ANYBODY EVERYTHING OUT OF FRESNO COUNTY YOU WOULD STILL HAVE. THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF IT IS. COMING FROM OTHER AREAS AND IT SETTLES IN THAT BASIN AND SO FOR. JUST KIND OF IT MAY BE A I GUESS A COMMENT FOR ME- MMHM THE GOAL IS TO MAKE THEIR CLEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY AND IN EVERY LOCALITY BUT SOME LOCALITIES HAVE SOME VERY CHALLENGING. DEMOGRAPHICS JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIERRAS AND THE WAY THE AIR LIGHT LIES IN THE BASIN AND YOU AND- SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS- FOR ME IT'S OF IT'S ABOUT HOW WE SPEND THE RESOURCE WE HAVE YOU KNOW I'VE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S- NO SECRET THAT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE- THE BULLET TRAIN OR THE VALLEY TRAIN SYSTEM ON I THINK WE SHOULD BE. SPENDING THOSE RESOURCES IN AREAS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE. THE CARBON OUTPUT- AND MOVE PEOPLE IN PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO THE AND LA. SO- SO THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY. GOING TO- THESE PROGRAMS AND I'M NOT OPPOSED TO IT BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO HOW WE ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND I KNOW THAT THOSE FOLKS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. ARE VERY FRUSTRATED I'VE HEARD THEM OVER THE YEARS OPPOSE EVENING LEGISLATION I WAS WORKING ON TO DO STUFF WITH- WITH BIOMASS- AND THEY POSE PLANTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY PUT OFF CARBON BUT IT WAS BETTER A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN OPEN BURNING. SO JUST SOME COMMENTS I AM I WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT. THE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST HERE THE PART IS A LOT OF THIS EVENING. IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN TO THIS MAGNITUDE BEFORE. SO THANK YOU FOR SUCH A- SIGNATURE BLEND FAILING TO MOVE UNDER SECRETARY CROWFOOT BUT- QUITE THE SENATE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR- AND YOUR RESOURCE FOR PROGRAM FOR WOOD STOVE REPLACEMENT. AND THIS WAS A QUITE POPULAR- PROGRAM THAT BEFORE YOU- BECAME SECRETARY- AND IT HAS A DIRECT READ IT DIRECTLY RESULTS IN. REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS AND AIR QUALITY IT ACTUALLY IMPROVES OUR QUALITY AS WELL AS AS THE COMMISSION WHAT TYPE OF. IMPACT DO YOU THINK THE FIVE MILLION CAN HAVE ON THE REMAINING. BAD STOVES I GUESS THAT THERE. THE CHALLENGE JIM THAT ARE UP THERE. MAYBE I MEAN BACK LOVE THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AND- WHEN I WAS A U. S. T. PAY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIS STATE FOCUSING ON ON HOW TO- SHE REALLY- INCIDENTS PROGRAMS AND ACTUALLY JUST SEND THE DALITS POINT THERE'S THRIVING BUSINESSES TO MAKE THE WOOD PALLETS FULL THIS DOES THAT BAN CLEAN I AM AND IT'S A GREAT WAY OF. CLEARING- CLEARING AND SUPPLYING CLEAN FUEL- SO YEAH THE THESE PROGRAMS AGREED DEMONSTRABLE WE CAN WE CAN SHOW YOU. YOU KNOW- TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS INVESTED. HOW MUCH- CRITERIA AND CARBON POLLUTION IS- REDUCE SATISFACTORY ALL THESE PROGRAMS THAT THE BENEFIT OF THEM IS THAT THEY'RE VERY DEMONSTRABLE IN TIMES OF. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FUNDING. AND THE POLLUTION IS USED AS UNITS. ALL KNOW- COMMITTEE. IT ALSO- SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT FOR THE INDOOR AIR POLLUTION. I'M RELATED TO SOME OF THESE WOODS DOES IS ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE THAN THAN ANY OF THAT. OUR GOAL POLLUTION CREATED SAYS YEAH THE GREAT PROGRAM. EXCELLENT LET'S GO ON TO. A SECTOR CRAWFORD. YOU'VE GOT THE SENATE HIS SHOWN SOME. I'M PRO TO COME UNDER YOUR THE- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON A HEALTHY FORCE WORKING LANDS- WETLAND RESTORATION OR. YEAH I'LL BE BRIEF- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW YOU REFERENCE CHAIR HAPPY TOGETHER AND THAT REFERS TO THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE BUT CERTAINLY ACROSS AGENCIES SO I'M HERE FIRST AND FOREMOST JUST TO SUPPORT- JARRETT'S WORK AND THAT THE WORK AT COUNTY PA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THIS IS TRULY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT EFFORT. TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE I'LL SAY THAT WERE REALLY THANKFUL OF THE SENATE'S VISION- THAT NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS BE PART OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE INVESTMENTS IN HEALTHY RESILIENT FORESTS AS WELL AS OTHER LANDSCAPE SUCH AS WETLANDS WE CONTINUE TO THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE CLIMATE PUZZLE- AND ARE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF- THE SENATE'S RECOGNITION OF THAT SO I HERE OBVIOUSLY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND SIMPLY SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST. YEAH IT DIED AS YOU KNOW ONE OF THINGS ONE EMPHASIZES GIVEN THE BUDGET THAT WE PROPOSED OR THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE ON HEALTHY FOREST. OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT THE WITH THAT WE'RE TRYING TO- STATUS TO ON TOP SO THAT'S SOME MONEY COMES FROM. CAP AND TRADE SOME MONEY COMES FROM- THE- THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE PUT AWAY- SECRETARY ROSS YOU HAVE A- YOU HAVE SOME METHANE REDUCTION AND HEALTHY FOREST AND- PROGRAMS IN HERE ALSO DO YOU HAVE A HAVE YES I HAVE NOTHING REDUCTION IN THE DAIRY SECTOR AS WELL AS HEALTHY SOILS- AND I WANT TO ECHO WHAT MY TWO COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER- AND THESE VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS- AND CALL OUT IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS- IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR- AND THE PARTNERSHIP THAT THEY CREATED. ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE WITH MANY OF OUR NGOS TO REALLY ACHIEVE- THE STATE ABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN PARTICULAR IT'S IMPORTANT TO HOLD UP THE NATIONAL WORKING LANDS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THAT WE HAVE TO DRIVE DOWN CARBON IN SUPPORT AND HOLD IT IN OUR SOILS ARE IN OUR TREES- AND IN PARTICULAR THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM- HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AT THIS OFTENTIMES WHEN WE PARTNER WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. ON THESE PROGRAMS WE SEE MULTIPLE BENEFITS- AN EXAMPLE AND HEALTHY SOILS IS NOT ONLY THE ABILITY TO SEQUESTER CARBON AND IMPROVE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THOSE SOILS- FOR LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND CROP PRODUCTION BUT ALSO WATER HOLDING CAPACITY. WHICH IN CALIFORNIA IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- IMPROVED NUTRIENT CYCLING AND ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH OF OUR BIODIVERSITY IS ACTUALLY IN OUR SOILS- OVER THE HISTORY OF THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WE'VE GOTTEN APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OUT TO OVER SIX HUNDRED PROJECTS INCLUDING DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO SHOW OTHER FARMERS THE PRACTICES THAT WILL DO THESE- THESE. ARE THE QUESTION IS. MAKE THE CUT OF IMPROVE I TALK ABOUT THE ACT- NEXT TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE REDUCES OVER A HUNDRED AND TWELVE. THOUSAND METRIC TONS PER YEAR OVER THE LIFETIME OF THESE PROJECTS. WITH REGARD TO NOTHING REDUCTION ARE DAIRY FAMILIES HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP AND SHOWN LEADERSHIP IN THIS REGARD WE HAVE TWO ELEMENTS ARE NOTHING REDUCTION PROGRAM ONE IS FOR TERRY DI TESTERS. FOR THE GENERATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY- AND DOING THE JERRY pALSO MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO REDUCE OUR OTHER. HI JERRY OF POLLUTANTS. IN THE AIR AS WELL AS- IMPROVED. ABILITY TO MITIGATE WATER QUALITY IMPACTS AND THE ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WHICH ALLOWS MANY OF OUR SMALLER SCALE- PRODUCERS TO BE ABLE TO CONVERT BACK RICH NUTRIENT SOURCE INTO COMPOST AND OTHER MINORITIES PRODUCTS- AND- THAT PROGRAM HAS HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE JERRY FAMILIES PARTICIPATE. OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE PROGRAM WE CALCULATE THAT THERE'S BEEN A TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION OF ABOUT TWO POINT THREE MILLION METRIC TONS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND LOOK FORWARD TO BEING HAPPY TOGETHER. IN PARTNERSHIP. I'M MAYBE SOMEBODY FROM CAL RECYCLE ENOUGH SEX THE DIRECTOR WAGNER'S ERE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WASTE DIVERSION WE HAVE BEEN A WAVE CAL FIRE HERE WHO'S GOT WOULD WAYS WE'VE GOT AGRICULTURE PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGRICULTURE WAYS. URBAN PEOPLE HAVE URBAN WASTE AND THAT TERRY PEOPLE HAVEN'T JERRY WAYS IS THERE ARE. OPPORTUNITIES ON THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE FOR- WASTE DIVERSION TED TO GET SOME OF THESE COUNTIES AND CITIES WHO. HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED ANY OF THE- S. B. THIRTY EIGHTY. OF GO IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF JUST SIT BY WHERE THEY- WE MAY. BRING SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW AND ON THE STEAM OF HAPPY TOGETHER CAN WE BRING SOME OF THESE WASTE PRODUCER METHANE EMITTERS TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION APPRECIATE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW POWER THE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE RAGS IN THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY- AFTER MANY MANY WORKSHOPS WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT. WE AND WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE L. A.'S. AT THE LANDFILLS AND THEN OUR PARTNERS AT CDFA AND NATURAL RESOURCES ON COMING UP WITH SOME CREATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THEIR ORGANICS WASTE. AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOOD WORK AND A LOT OF CREATIVITY ACROSS THE STATE AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF JURISDICTIONS. AND WE CONTINUE THAT PARTNERSHIP- ADDITIONALLY OUR CYCLE HAS DEVELOPED. DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOOLS TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND ESTABLISH THEIR ORDINANCES AND FIGURE OUT THE PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM BUT YES I ABSOLUTELY AGREE I THINK THAT IN THE THEME I'M HAPPY TOGETHER THERE IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY HERE. AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE OUR SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. REDUCTION. GOAL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. BOB I HAVE A FOLLOW. I CENTER DOLLY SO WANTED TO AYE OPPOSED SKEWS ME I'VE THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE FOR THE REASON THAT. THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFICULT IN A DISTRICT. LIKE MINE THAT IS IT WOULD COST IT WOULD HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT DESPITE THE TRANSPORTATION OF MOVING ALL THESE. RECYCLABLES OR OR ORGANICS AROUND AND SO ARE OTHER EXERT A FOCUS ON LOOKING AT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING- IN THE LOCAL LOCALITIES IN DISTRICTS SUCH AS MINE WHAT WE HAVE- YOU KNOW LOOKS VERY SMALL COMMUNITY SPREAD. VERY FAR APART. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS I'M- AYE SO BEAUTIFUL ABOUT SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS IT REALLY LEAVES. THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVISE A PLAN FOR HOW BEST TO MEET THESE OBJECTIVES THE 75% REDUCTION GOAL IS A STATE WIDE GOAL IT ISN'T. YOUR SECTION BY JURISDICTION SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO HOLD EVERY JURISDICTION. TO A 75% REDUCTION OF THEIR ORGANICS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS. THAT HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTIONS FOR HOW THEY COME INTO COMPLIANCE SO IT'S REALLY NICE TO BE- AND THEN YOU THAT. FAST FOR THE INDIVIDUAL REGIONS. AND THAT'S WHY I SAID THAT WORKING TOGETHER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET TOWARDS COMPLIANCE TOGETHER. SMALL AND LARGE AND IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR THAT JURISDICTION I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING IN PLACE SYSTEMS. THAT AND BACK CREATE AND NEW OR DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL HARM TO ADDRESS THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS MEANT TO ADDRESS. AND SO YES VERY MUCH WORKING WHEN THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS LEARNERS JURISDICTIONS FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM. THANK YOU- WE HAVE DODD CHIEF PORTER ON AND I WAS I KNOW WE TOOK SOME EARLY ACTION ON OUR HEALTHY. OF FOR SOME REASON ARE HEALTHY AND RESILIENT FORCE AND THERE AND NOW WE HAVE- TWO HUNDRED MILLION HERE CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE WHY HAVE YOU ON. WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IS IT.

HOW IS THAT. RULING OUT. I GUESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO WITH THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING THEIR NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT- THAT CAL FIRE IS RECEIVING. FUNDING FOR. ALL OF THEM HAVE MOVED FORWARD AND PLANS TO SPEND THE FUNDS AND SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE. GOTTEN FUNDING INTO PARTNERS HANDS- SPECIFICALLY BE FORCED HEALTH GRANT PROGRAM- AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MY CAMERA LAYING HERE. THE FIRST UPGRADE PROGRAM- HAS BEEN MOVING- WITH- PROJECTS THAT WERE UNABLE TO BE FUNDED IN PRIOR YEARS DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING. AND ARE EXECUTING GRANT AGREEMENTS WITH THOSE PARTNERS ALSO OUR UNIT FIRE- OUR UNITS ARE WORKING A FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS AND THEY- HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN COMPLETING WORK. ON OVER THE PAST MONTHS. WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON GETTING FUNDS INTO CONTRACTS FOR ADDITIONAL WORK ENHANCING SOME EXISTING PROJECTS AND BRINGING IN. NEW PROJECTS. OTHER EARLY ACTION FUNDING HAS BEEN REALLY CRITICAL FOR HELPING US- TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. THROUGH THROUGH MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS. OKAY DON'T SEE ANY I GUESS THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION WE SEE THE SENATE PLAN FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR PULLS OUT THE S. R. A FEE- AND TAKES THAT FROM OTHER SOURCES. IS JUST SO EVERYBODY'S CLEAR IT I THINK EVERY UNDERSTANDS IT'S NOT CHANGING THE PROGRAM OR NOT CHANGING THE WORK PLAN THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE FOR ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF ONE IF ANYBODY CAN SELL PROPERTY AND THE- THE MOVIE NOW NOWADAYS. BUT BUT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A FUNDING MECHANISM SO THAT SOME. ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO LOOK AT CARBON REDUCTION- EXPENDITURES AT LEAST FOR A YEAR RIGHT- LET'S SEE. FINANCE I HAVEN'T CHIPPED IN WITH FINANCES IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE JANUARY PROPOSAL- NOT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING TO ME REVISED WE GOT THAT MAY CAP AND TRADE AUCTION A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT MISTER. Z. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHERILUS HERE YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

OKAY YEAH GOOD WE'RE WE'RE- PARTICULARLY- YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THE- LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T COME UNDER THIS. SIX SEVENTEEN UMBRELLA WAS VERY POPULAR. IS AT LEAST THE DATA THAT WE READ. OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS THE EMISSIONS FROM OUR BUILDINGS PARTICULAR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS- IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO. TO HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION TAKE A LOOK AT THAT END OF NOTE. AS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THESE. SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. ARE TRIED AND TRUE THAT ARE- YOU KNOW. THE WOOD STOVE REPLACEMENT THAT DIDN'T GET ANY MONEY BUT WE THINK WHAT WE DON'T PUT IT UNDER THE BANNER OF EQUITY PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT IT. IT HAS THE FULL WALKS LIKE A DUCK TALKS LIKE A DUCK AND HAS ALL THAT INTO SHOULD THE PEOPLE LOOK AT- LET'S SAY THE SENATOR STERN YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST SINCE WE ACHIEVED PORTER ON AYE I WANTED A. EXTEND MY APPRECIATION- FOR FOLLOWING THROUGH ON. THE IMPORTANT DIRECTION IN OUR EARLY ACTION FUNDING PLAN NOT JUST ABOUT- WHERE THE MONEY MOVES BUT HOW IT'S INVESTED IN THAT KIND OF OUTREACH THAT'S BEING DONE- TO ADD DIVERSE REGIONS AROUND THE STATE SO SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO ASK. DO YOUR POINT MISTER CHAIR IT'S A THOUGHT THAT I WANTED TO PUT ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S RADAR I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT FITS TOGETHER BUT- THE LINK BETWEEN THE RICH WINTERIZATION AND OUR AND OUR SORT OF EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AND THE HOME HARDENING SIDE OF THINGS. AND WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OPPORTUNITIES FORM FOR LEVERAGING MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS GOING FORWARD I KNOW WE ONLY HAVE LIMITED- FUNDS AVAILABLE I NOTICED YOU KNOW IN OUR IN THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION PLAN YOU WERE GONNA HIT WHAT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND I THINK IN. OUR PROPOSAL. JUST FOR THE INSPECTION SIDE- AND YOU KNOW AS YOU ALL HAVE STATED THIS IS A THAT THAT. THE SIZE OF THE HARDENING CHALLENGE IS VERY LARGE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR ESTIMATE- SO ARE THERE ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS IN MULTIPLE PROGRAMS HERE SO IF YOU HAVE. LOW INCOME. RESIDENTS WHO NEEDS WEATHER STRIPPING ON THEIR HOME. THEY ALSO WITH THAT WEATHER STRIPPING YOU COULD DO GAS GETTING IN YOUR GARAGE. OR WHILE YOU'RE YOU KNOW MAKING SURE EMBERS CAN'T GET THROUGH YOUR WINDOWS CAN YOU- CAN YOU OFF THE SAME TIME THAT RETROFIT ALSO LOOK AT. THE FIRE HARDENING OPPORTUNITIES- GRANTED IT'LL BE AS A SUBSET OF THAT POPULATION BUT I JUST. WANTED TO RAISE IT FOR THE- YEAH COMMITTEE OR THE AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S. JUST AS A POTENTIAL ECONOMY OF SCALE BECAUSE WE KNOW ALSO THERE'S SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL DOLLARS IN THAT SPACE AS WELL- ENDING POTENTIALLY SO- SOMETHING TO CONSIDER BUT ON THE WHOLE MISTER CHAIR I'M- YEAH AT A- IN THE DISCUSSION THUS FAR AND- YEAH I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING BIG NO DATE. ANYONE ON THE ADMINISTRATION LIKE TO COMMENT. WELL I CAN I CAN START- IN THANK YOU SENATOR STERN VERY FOR YOUR QUESTION AND YOUR- YOUR THOUGHTFUL WORDS THAT WILDFIRE OR- THIS LAST WEEKEND AND- CALABASAS RIGHT TO THIS AND- I THINK. WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL ASPECTS OF HOME GARDENING IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NEW FOR US- TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM. THAT IS- LOOKING AT THAT ELEMENT- AND AS YOU'RE AWARE TRULY AREAS LIKE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE OUR EFFORTS THAT WE DO THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS- HOMEOWNERS- RESPONSIBILITY BUT THERE ARE- AREAS WHERE- PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME OR PEOPLE OF NEED ARE CAN BENEFIT FROM. MORE OF A COMMUNITY WIDE APPROACH WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES- AS WELL AS DOING THE EDUCATION TO ALL WHERE ALL HOMEOWNERS. BUT TO THE LEVERAGING OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND OTHER FUNDS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BOTH LOCALLY AND THROUGH- NONPROFIT- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CAN AND WILL BE LOOKING AT AS OPPORTUNITIES. OF COURSE WE'RE WORKING WITH CALLOW YES ON THE THEME OF FUNDS TO HOPEFULLY FIND A WAY TO. LEVERAGE OUR THE DOLLARS ARE COMING IN FROM STATE COFFERS AND- I THINK I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT DANIEL BROUGH LATCHES SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ON HOW THIS IS DONE DEALING WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND THE GRANT PROGRAM. IS FUNDED THROUGH THIS EFFORT. UNDER THAT PROGRAM AS WELL DANIEL. THANK YOU CHIEF AND- GOOD MORNING. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO IMPLANT ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH CAL FIRE- FIRST I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THANKS TO THE EARLY ACTION OF MONEY THAT YOU DID PUT FORWARD- WE HAVE BEEN REALLY- MOVING FORWARD AT A FAST PACE WORKING WITH CALLAWAY HAS TO BUILD HE STRUCTURE. TO YOUR QUESTION- CENTER IN YOUR POINT- LEVER ANY PROGRAM WE CAN TO BE NOT ONLY IF IT'S BUT HELL US. INTO THE BILL TO HARD HOMES HIS ABSOLUTELY SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK AT I'LL NOTE WE ARE BRINGING OTHER DEPARTMENTS LIKE- EACH CD HOUSING TO MEET OF ELEMENT THE TRYING TO LEVERAGE EFFORTS THEY'RE DOING I AM MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE- NOT ONLY BE AN EFFICIENT NOT ONLY THAT WERE STREAMLINING BUT THAT WORRY ABOUT REALLY ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THIS PROGRAM AND SO. I THINK YOUR YOUR POINT ABOUT THE WEATHER IS ATION- PROGRAM WITH OUR SISTER AGENCY IS SPOT ON AND WE WILL DEFINITELY JUMP INTO THE LOOKING THAT AND THEN BACK TO. REPORTERS COMMENT ABOUT THE OVERALL FIRE PREVENTION GRANT FUNDING- WE'RE ONLY ABOUT A WEEK AWAY FROM CLOSING OR APPLICATION PERIOD AND AGAIN- THANK YOU TO THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS THAT YOU PUT FORWARD WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO QUICKLY- RANK BILLS.

AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM HOME HARDING- BUT AS WELL THE FIRE BRIDGE RAMP PROGRAM. BOB FOLLOWS ONE. SINISTER LEVINE ESE. JUST JUST ONE FINAL FOLLOW POINT FOR CONSIDERATION AND- ONE MORE DOVE TAILING I GUESS THAT I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT AS WE AS WE SORT OF WORK I'M SORT OF MULTI JURISDICTIONAL BASIS AND ALSO AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT FOR LEVERAGE PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS- I THINK OF MY DISTRICT THE PRETTY DIVERSE COMMUNITY IN TERMS INCOME- CERTAIN PARTS. THAT ARE UNIQUE PEOPLE LIVING IN MOBILE HOMES- IN ON FIXED INCOME AND OTHER PARTS IN A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR MANSIONS- YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE RANGE AND SO I THINK WE'RE SMART TO BE PUSHING ON PRIVATE HOMEOWNER. ACTION AND I GUESS I JUST. BE INSURANCE SIDE OF THINGS SEEMS LIKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT DRIVER FOR THAT AND THAT'S IN THE CENTER REQUIRE MYSELF I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A WHILE TRYING TO GET RECOGNITION FOR THOSE EFFORTS TAKEN BY HOMEOWNERS THAT THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO HOLD ON TO THEIR INSURANCE IF THEY UNDERTAKE CARTONING MEASURES ON THEIR OWN TIME BUT THAT HELPS THEM ACTUALLY YOU KNOW KEEP THEIR- THEIR AT THEIR COSTS DOWN. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO THEY DON'T GET ACTUALLY PRICED OUT OF THEIR OWN HOME SO- I WANTED ALSO THROW OUT THERE AND I'LL BE FOLLOWING UP- AS THE AS THIS BUDGET. MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT- I LEADING THE FARM ENSURE IS WELL. AND I THINK CD I CAN ACTUALLY PLAY A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE- IN TERMS OF. EXPEDITING THE AUDIT AND INSPECTION PROCESS AND REALLY TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE CERTIFICATION THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW FOR- IT INCENTIVE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES. SO JUST TRYING TO CREATE STANDARDIZATION SO I'M HOPING THAT AS WE GO FORWARD THIS. WILDFIRE PACKAGE BOTH IN THE- FIRE PACKAGE AS WELL AS WHAT'S BEFORE US HERE TODAY THAT. THAT WEEK WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH CDI. AND HOW TO LEVERAGE THEIR EXPERTISE ON THE RISK PROFILES AND THE MODELING THAT THEY USE IN THE INDUSTRY EXPERTISE THIS OUT THERE- AND REALLY TRYING TO. DICTATE TRIGGER THAT PRIVATE CAPITAL INTO THE SPACE TO DO SO THANKS FOR THE INTELLIGENCE ON THIS PIECE MISTER CHAIR AND AGAIN. SINCERE THANKS TO THE CHIEF PORTER AND FOR EVERYONE FOR SHOWING UP AND WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES- YOU KNOW I KNOW WE'VE GOT A DEADLINE COMING UP I'M HOPING THAT THE COMMUNITIES CAN. GET CREATIVE AND COORDINATED QUICKLY ENOUGH BUT THE I ALSO HOPE THAT. IF WE CAN HIT IT- YOU KNOW HERE IN MAY DAY BUT THERE WILL BE THIS ONGOING STRAIN SO THAT AS PEOPLE WAKE UP TO THIS AND ALL THIS OUT REACH STARTS TO PAY OFF THAT. WOULD BE ABLE TO- AT THE MEET THE TO MEET THE COMMUNITY IN RIGHT SO THANKS A LOT. HUNDRED DOLLARS. THANK YOU I WANT TO JUST. TAKE A- STERN'S CO AND USE IT AS- BECAUSE- TALKING. EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY COMMUNITY SO THAT REPORTER- DOCTOR PORTER I WAS WONDERING- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE FACED WITH. IS THAT WE HAVE THE LOCAL FOR THE MAYBE THE CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE CAL FIRE WE HAVE INSURANCE ISSUES IN ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THERE IS REALLY NO HAS BEEN KNOWN BUDDY THAT ACTUALLY IS AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND I THINK PART OF THIS INSPECTION PROCESS IT SHOULD BE WE ACTUALLY GET A CERTIFICATE THAT SAYS HEY THIS LANDOWNER HAS MET THE CRITERIA SO THEY CAN TAKE THAT. TO THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY AND SAY HEY WE'VE DONE HOME HARDENING WE'VE HAVE ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE- IS THAT CAN YOU COMMENT MAYBE ON HOW THAT WOULD LOOK THEM AND THAT WHICH WHICH AGENCY ACTUALLY HAS THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. GO OUT AND INSPECT AND GIVE A CERTIFICATE TO THE LANDOWNER THAT THAT THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB ON DOING THE BEST THEY CAN AND IN THE PART OF THE STATE THAT THEY LIVE IN. AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO KEEP THEIR PROPERTY AND THEMSELVES SAFE. SENATOR DOLLY THAT'S A THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION AND THAT WHILE HOME HARDENING IS PART OF THE ANSWER- IT IS NEW SO IT IS NOT A PART OF- KIND OF THE BROADER. PERSPECTIVES YET IT WILL BE AS WE START MOVING FORWARD- IN THIS SPACE DEFENSIBLE SPACE HOWEVER IS SOMETHING THAT- IS IT'S A COMPLIANCE. PROGRAM AND WHILE WE DON'T- I HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. INSPIRE INSPECT EVERY HOME IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA AND THAT'S WHAT I'M I'M REPRESENTING- WE DO TRY TO GET TO A ROUGHLY- EVERY PROPERTY WITH. WITH IN A THREE YEAR CYCLE. AND SO IS SO THERE ARE THERE IS SOME SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE AND CERTIFICATION- OF HOMES THAT ARE. MEETING THEIR DEFENSIBLE SPACE- IS SOMETHING THAT- THAT CAN BE DONE- WE'VE CONSIDERED AND CONTINUE TO LOOK AT SELF CERTIFICATION. POSSIBILITIES IN THAT SPACE AS WELL AS- COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO. SO THERE THERE IS ROOM TO WORK TO WORK FORWARD IN THAT SPACE I THINK- CHEAPER LAST MENTIONED. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE- MANY OF INSURANCEON ALL THESE IS. ARE GOING FORWARD AND WE DO SEE THAT THERE IS VALUE IN AND- FINING US WHERE INSURANCE- REDUCTION IN COSTS FOR LAND OWNERS BASED ON THEIR THEIR COMPLIANCE IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN LEVERAGE FORWARD. ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO OPPORTUNITIES DEFINITELY FOR- INCREASE THERE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE OF THAT THAT I HIGHLIGHTED WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. THERE'S ALSO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WHAT WHAT YOU MENTIONED IN THOSE THOSE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT- SPACES- WHERE WERE IN. AREAS THAT ARE LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSIBILITY- BUT- ALL OF THOSE ARE KIND OF FIRE SAFETY REGULATIONS ARE BEING COORDINATED AND SOME OF THAT- THE FIRE SAFE BREAKS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE- BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED. EVEN INTO THOSE LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS AND GIVE US SOME SOME- PLACES TO- KIND OF WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING. ACROSS THE BOARD. I'M A VERY MERGING KERR TO. HEAR THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF IT IS JUST THAT. DISTANCE EDUCATION AT THE AT THE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT THAT THEY CAN DO THE WORK OURSELVES THEY CAN DO THE MANAGEMENT THEMSELVES- AND SO THAT'S IT THAT'S KEY I THINK IT CROSSED. ALL ALL JURISDICTIONS. AND SOMEHOW WE NEED TO GET. ALL OF THEM WORKING TOGETHER COME UP WITH A PROGRAM THAT. ALLOWS THEM TO GET A CERTIFICATE THAT SAYS THEY'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETED THE WORK AND THERE'S- A IS SIGNED OFF SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE IT TO THEIR- INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE- AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR INSURANCE IN MANY CASES THEY GET HOME HARDEN THEIR HOUSE WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY'RE SPENDING ON INSURANCE TO KEEP THEIR INSURANCE THEIR HOUSES INSURED. ONE LAST COMMENT I KNOW THAT WERE. AS WE HAVE THE DIRECTOR HERE- IN THIS JUST A COMMENT- I KNOW THAT SB NINE OH ONE WE WE'RE ALLOCATING TO. THE TO HONOR MILLION YEAR I JUST WANTED TO. MAKE SURE TO FOCUS TO. TO DO BIOMASS UTILIZATION THAT'S ONE OF THE- I THINK FOR MOST OF THE STATE IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH ALL THIS MATERIAL AND HOW WE CAN. RE DIRECT THAT AND COME UP WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVES I JUST WANT THAT TO. BE ON YOUR RADAR SOMETHING THAT- I KNOW I'M FOCUSED ON AND MANY OTHERS IN THE STATE THAT. OF OTHER WAYS TO USE THAT MATERIAL- TO. AFFECTIVELY STORE THAT CARBON SO A JUST A NOTE FOR THAT. AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR- THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED US HERE TODAY. YEAH I REALIZED DON'T HAVE OPR. WE DON'T HAVE THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL HERE BUT WHERE THERE IS. SOME AT LEAST AN INVESTMENT THAT THE SENATE HAS THAT THAT'S LIKE TO. LET EVERYBODY TALK. TAGS OR EIGHT. TRY TO DIGEST HIS SET ON CLIMATE RESEARCH AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND- PLANNING CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM AND THEN THESE SHOVEL READY PROJECT DURING THE DAY HOPEFULLY CROSSETT GO ACROSS ALL JURISDICTIONS WHETHER IT'S IN THE AG MARKET OR THE FORESTRY MARKET OR NATURAL RESOURCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S- THERE'S IT'S ONE THING I KNOW THERE'S A BIG INVESTMENT BY THE MINISTRATION ON. SIX ONE SEVEN AND TO HAVE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A WOOD STOVE CLICHE A PICTURE'S WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS AND I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY LIKES TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE SEE THE PROJECT WORKING IT HAS AN ADVANTAGE DEMONSTRATED AND WE BRING IN PLANNING. OUR FOLKS SAID HAZARD- THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY HELP US REDUCE THE CARBON SELF I DON'T KNOW IF. ANYBODY ON THE SPOT BUT THERE IS THOSE THOSE CATEGORIES THERE THAT THEY'RE PART UNDER ANYBODY'S PARTICULAR JURISDICTION BECAUSE IT SAYS THIS IS THE INTEGRATED OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH BUT EVERYBODY GETS A CHANCE TO COME IN WITH THEIR RESILIENCY PROGRAM OR THEIR- PILOT PROGRAM THIS COULD EFFECTIVELY SHOW HOW WE REDUCE CARBON SPHERES SO- DASHES. THIS IS IN THERE. PART OF OUR DISCUSS- AND THAT'S THAT IS ANYBODY DID ASK FINANCE ALREADY REJECTED FOR A DEBT AND GET US FINANCE FINANCES IS COMMON SO IF ANYBODY DOESN'T. SINISTERLY EVER HAD UP OR IS THAT YEAH OKAY. I JUST WANTED TO I GUESS APPLAUD YOU FOR. KEEPING RESEARCH ALIVE YEAR AFTER YEAR- THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME. BUT HEY IT'S THIS WON'T SIT ON A SHELF I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND I AND I DID WANT TO TRY TO GET. L. A. ALWAYS TAKE ON. YES HOW HOW THIS RESEARCH. COULD WILL BE OPERATIONALIZED POTENTIALLY LIKE WHERE WHERE'D WHERE WE CAN REALLY START TO IDENTIFY THE VALUE ADD AS IT AS AN EXAMPLE SINCE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE CHIEF HERE AND- AND OUR FIRE SIDE OF THINGS- FROM AN EMERGENCY. PLANNING PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA YES ARE ARE VERY BUSY AGENCIES AND IN SOME WAYS. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK TO- YES THE STATE LEVEL OR EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THEY DON'T HAVE IN HOUSE WHEN THEY DO A RISK MAPPING PROJECT WHEN THEY LOOK IT'S A FIRE RISK IN AN AREA THAT WOULD TO A CONSULTANT AND- PUT BACK TOGETHER TECHNICALLY FOR A COUNTY OR CITY AND GATHER THAT DATA. BUT THE BUT THE LONG TERM PERSONNEL. ACTUALLY KNOWS WHERE THOSE AT RISK COMMUNITIES ARE WHEN A BAD THING HAPPENS LIKE A FIRE AND CAN BE THERE IN INCIDENT COMMAND WITH SORT OF OPERATIONALIZED RESEARCH IF YOU WILL- IT SEEMS TO ME A REALLY. EXCITING SYNTHESIS OF WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD HERE WHERE AND YOU CAN YOU CAN APPLY THAT ON A NUMBER OF OTHER OF THE RESILIENCY FRONTS RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST WILD FIRE USED AS AN EXAMPLE BUT- TO HAVE. THIS SORT OF BUT CLIMATE RISK MODELING BUILDING NOT JUST A LONG TERM LAND USE PLANNING. BUT THE SHORT TERM. CLIMATE DISASTER. PRE HAZARD. IF YOU WILL RIGHT IF WE CAN DO THAT CREE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING AND GETTING INTO GENERAL PLANS. AND THE SORT OF GOVERNING DOCUMENTS OF HAZARD MANAGEMENT LOCALLY. WE'RE GONNA END UP SAVING LIVES THIS RESEARCH I MEAN I SO I JUST I DON'T MEAN TO INDULGE TOO MUCH IN THAT POINT BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CLIMATE ASSESSMENT ITSELF IN DOING THIS FIFTH VERSION. I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT THE SIDECAR POSITIONS IN LOCAL RESILIENCY OFFICERS CAN DO BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU'VE GIVEN THAT ANY THOUGHT OF. HOW PLANNING ACTUALLY ISN'T JUST PLANNING BUT IN THE IN IN THE KIND OF. PLANNING AND RESEARCH PROPOSAL THAT THE SENATE PUT FORWARD. YOU SEE THE ABILITY FOR PLANNING TO BECOME LIFESAVING TO. DOWNPOUR I'M NOT TOO FAR DOWN WILL. YEAH I THINK- I THINK IT'S A GREAT KIND OF AREA OF THIS KIND OF FOCUS AND QUESTIONING UNFORTUNATELY KIND OF ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES REGULATORS WAS WORK A LOT ON KIND OF YOU KNOW CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND ADAPTATION KIND OF ISN'T ON THE CALL RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK. AT A HIGH LEVEL- YEAH I THINK KIND OF THE ISSUES AROUND JUST KIND OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING- AND SORT OF PLANNING WHAT THE RISKS ARE WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW TO POSITION RESOURCES HOW TO SORT OF INVEST RESOURCES IN A WAY TO KIND OF. REDUCE THAT RISK MOST EFFECTIVELY IS AN ISSUE THAT I KNOW IT HIGHLIGHTED A LOT IN THE WILDFIRE SPACE JUST DIFFERENT SORT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON BUT I THINK IT SORT OF AS YOU POINT OUT IT KIND OF CUTS ACROSS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND SO. I THINK RESEARCH AND GENERAL- JUST KIND OF GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF- YOU WHERE THE RISKS ARE ON KIND OF ADAPTATION CITING THE RESILIENCY SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE MITIGATION SIDE AND KIND OF WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR OUR OUR RESOURCES AND KIND OF OUR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- I KNOW WE HIGHLIGHTED A LOT IN THE PAST IS KIND OF AN AREA OF THIS. MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO KIND OF FOCUS RESOURCES ON BECAUSE IN THE END YOU'RE GONNA YOU KNOW YOU YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO BE MAKING A LOT OF A POLICY DECISIONS GOING FORWARD ABOUT KIND OF HOW DO AND INVEST RESOURCES IN FUTURE YEARS OUT IT WOULD KNOW WHICH POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO ADOPT AND- JUST THE MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT. HOW TO INVEST THOSE IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY AND KIND OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT STRATEGIES ARE KIND OF MOST EFFECTIVE AT ACHIEVING BOTH OF THOSE GOALS ON CERTAIN MITIGATION ADAPTATION SIDE IS REALLY GOING TO HELP- YOU THE LEGISLATURE CERTAIN AND MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AROUND THOSE ISSUES SO MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN BROWN IS ALSO ON THE CALL YOU MIGHT HAVE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SORT OF TIME AND WAY AND I'M- YOU CAN DO THAT BUT I THINK KIND OF THE FOCUS ON SORT OF RESEARCH. OR SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE GENERALLY SUPPORT OF A LOT THE PAST. TO HELP INFORM DECISIONS. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW MISTER BROWN AS A COMMENT BUT- AS A FINAL. OF POINT OF CLEAR. SINCE WE HAVE. FIRE I KNOW WE GAVE. LANGUAGE THAT THERE. A DIRECT TO. WITH FIRE FROM. PROGRAM. LOCALS ARE ABLE TO SORT OF. PUSH BACK DATA UP. AND IN THEORY WE CAN HAVE. SORT OF SOME. OF ASSESS. THAT AS A FISCAL- X. ELEMENT SEVEN WHAT WHERE WERE APPROPRIATE FIRE FROM. YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE'RE HITTING THE PEOPLE WE'RE GETTING IT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST. FASTNESS ANATOMIES BACK BUT JUSTICE IN THIS BUDGET.
