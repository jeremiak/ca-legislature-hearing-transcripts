BUT AFTER THAT I WANT TO SAY I'M-ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL -- CURRENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS DEVOTED SIGNIFICAN AMOUNT OF TIME TRYING TO SECURE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF FINANCING AS YOU WILL NOTICE CHAIR. NATURALLY THIS FURTHER DRIVES UP THE COST OF PRODUCTION AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO BE DRIVING IT DOWN. ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAILIES BILL WHICH THIS COMMITTEE WILL HEAR LATER THIS MORNING I WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A UNIVERSAL APPLICATION PROCESS FOR VOTER APPROVED BOND FUND PROGRAMS UNDER EIGHT CITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITY. THIS BILL WILL ACQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AND NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO STREAMLINED APPLICATION PROCESS FOR TAX EXEMPT BOND ISSUANCES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. STATE OR FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND MIXED INCOME HOUSING PROGRAM AND OTHER PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY CAL HFA -- THAT'S THE BILL IN A HAPPY RIVER OF SOVIET SPHERE I'VE A RATE -- LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORT IS THE BILL. IS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. QUESTIONS MISS QUIRK SILVA. JUST A COMMENT I EIGHT SINCERELY APPRECIATE THIS STREAMLINING APPROACH AS SOME OF US. HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THAT -- THERE'S NOW RESOURCES THAT HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN AVAILABLE AND FOR A SMALL CITIES OR EVEN LARGER CITIES TO NAVIGATE THAT WITH MULTIPLE -- SOMETIMES EFFORTS TO TO GET THOSE RESOURCES THIS I THINK WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT SO I WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S NOBODY ELSE HERE SO. I WAS GONNA SAY I MOVE THE BILL BUT WELL WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE QUORUM BUT SHE HAD A DISASTER YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS WITH A LOT OF HOMELESSNESS FUNDING IN BEING ABLE TO IT AGAIN STREAMLINED FOCUS DRIVE DOWN COSTS PUT MONEY MORE MONEY ON THE STREET. SO IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE THE FUNDS THE NEXT STEP IS TO ACTUALLY GET THE FUNDS. GREAT I JUST WANT TO SAY. KUDOS TO YOUR EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR ALL OF THE VARIOUS POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES FOR FOR FOR HOUSING I THINK I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE THE GALL AND APPRECIATE THE MOMENTS YOU'VE TAKEN TO WHAT. MAKE THIS BILL BETTER AND CERTAINLY PLAN TO SUPPORT IT -- WHEN WE HAVE COR? SO MR ANYTHING ANYTHING FUNNY LIKE TO SAY SIR ALL RIGHT LET US GO TO YOUR NEXT ITEM TACTIC -- THIS IS AB FOURTEEN OH FIVE MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FROM THIS BILL -- INDIVIDUALS RELEASED FROM PRISON FACE SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES IN OBTAINING HOUSING STABILITY WHILE PERIOD PEOPLE EXPECTED HOMELESSNESS SUFFER HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES A STRONG LINK BETWEEN OUR CONSERVATION AND HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE ON PAROLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SET A DATE -- THAN PAROLEES WHO ARE HOUSED TRAGICALLY PAROLEES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TEND TO CYCLE BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS SHELTERS HOSPITALS IN JAIL. IN FACT THE LA OWES OFFICE ESTIMATES INCARCERATED PRISONER COST CALIFORNIA ABOUT EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHILE THE RATE OF RECIDIVISM IN CALIFORNIA HAS REMAINED ABOUT FIFTY DOLLARS 50%. IN THE PAST DECADE. UNDOUBTEDLY STABLE HOUSING IS THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSFUL RE ENTRY FROM PRISON. THIS BILL CONFORMS EXISTING LAW WITH EVIDENCE BASED HOUSING FIRST PRACTICES FOR DECREASING HOMELESSNESS AND RECIDIVISM BY REQUIRING CDC ARE TO PRIORITIZE PROVIDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS EXITING PRISON WHO ARE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. AND PAROLEES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH ME THIS MORNING ARE SHARED MEDICAL CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND CHRISTOPHER FROM HOUSING CALIFORNIA. GUYS WELCOME THIS REPORT. THANKS VERY MUCH AND SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF GLORIA SAID AND HOMELESSNESS AND INCARCERATION ARE AND ARE LINKED. AND AS YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE I'M FOOL WHO ARE HOMELESS OR SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SET OF A CDC ARE CURRENTLY FUNDS SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO HOUSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON WHO ARE AT RISK OF RECENT OF AIDING. HOWEVER UNDER THESE PROGRAM RULES CONTRACTORS CANNOT USE THESE FUNDS TO PROVIDE PERMANENT HOUSING -- WHICH IS HOUSING THAT DOESN'T LIMIT LENGTH OF STAY AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY WITH THE LEASE. PEOPLE OF EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS OFTENRETURN TO HOMELESSNESS ONE SHORT TERM HOUSING ENDS. UNLESS THEY'RE CONNECTED TO PERMANENT HOUSING WHEN THEY EXIT THAT SHORT TERM HOUSING. DATA INDICATE OVER 40% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXITING SHORT TERM HOUSING END UP BECOMING HOMELESS WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND THEN IN EVEN GREATER PERCENTAGE RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS WITHIN A YEAR. FOR PEOPLE -- PROLE PRETTY TURNED HOMELESSNESS INCREASES RISK OF THIS SORT OF ISM AS MENTIONED AND HIGH COST REPUBLIC SYSTEMS. BOTH PERMANENT HOUSING AND HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM. HOUSING NAVIGATION ENGAGES LANDLORDS IN NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRIVATE MARKET THE HOUSE PEOPLE I'M. CONNECTS PEOPLE THE BENEFITS AND HOUSING RESOURCES TO WHICH THEY'RE ENTITLED AND HELPS PEOPLE COMPLETE APPLICATIONS IN ACCESS DOCUMENTATION THEY NEED TO GET HOUSE. THESE SERVICES CAN BEGIN THE WORK OF HELPING PEOPLE FIND A PLACE TO LIVE EARLY ON SO THAT THEY CAN ACCEPT A HOUSING RATHER THAN HOMELESSNESS -- THIS BILL WILL PREVENT PEOPLE IMPROVE FROM BECOMING HOMELESSNESS -- FROM BECOMING HOMELESS AND IT'S A SIMPLE COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION -- CURBING THAT PRISON TO STREETS CRISIS. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA -- BUT JUST WANTED. TO REITERATE THAT ON THIS PROGRAM THESE MINOR CHANGES OF THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW -- FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO EXIT PRISON -- AN EXIT HOMELESSNESS INTO PERMANENT HOUSING -- WE KNOW THAT FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS -- AND SO THESE MINOR REVISIONS TO THIS PROGRAM CAN REALLY HAVE A LASTING EFFECT -- AND DRIVER. ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS THE BILL. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL [inaudible] SEEN. MISS WORKS OF ART. SORRY I WANT TO BE THE THE OVER TALKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT I DO HAVE TO COMMENT ON THIS ON THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL WEEK AS SOME OF THE BILLS MOVING FORWARD IN VARIOUS -- COMMITTEES -- I HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO WITH EACH OTHER SO FOR EXAMPLE I PRESENTED TO A BILL YESTERDAY AND HUMAN SERVICES RELATED TO SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL AND HOUSING -- BUT MANY TIMES WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO SUFFER WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ALSO HAVE ADDICTIONS AND MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHETHER IT BE A COUNTY JAIL PRISONER SO FORTH. AND AS I MENTIONED IN THE COMMITTEE YESTERDAY -- I TO HAVE A HAD A BROTHER WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND AS HE WAS DIED THIS YEAR IN THE FALL. ONE OF THE BILLS THAT. WOULD HAVE I THINK MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE A BILL LIKE THIS FOR HIM BECAUSE HAD HE BEEN ABLE TO EXIT -- WHETHER BE. A COUNTY JAIL. AND HAD A SITUATION WHERE HOUSING WAS THERE I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER -- WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY POSSIBLE IN YET BECAUSE THOSE WERE NOT THE SITUATIONS MANY TIMES -- FOR THOSE THAT ARE RELEASED THEY A PROBATION THEY HAVE. PSYCHIATRIC APPOINTMENTS AND FOR THEM TO NAVIGATE ALL OF THIS -- WITH VERY LITTLE OPPORTUNITY WHETHER EVEN BE TO DRIVE. FOR RESOURCES IT PUTS THEM BACK IN THE SAME SCENARIOS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN OFTEN TIMES -- TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST INITIALLY BUT THEN FALLING BACK SO I APPRECIATE THIS AND AND I KNOW THERE'RE WHEN PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT HOUSING AND PAROLEES. BRINGS UP THEIR THEY'RE KIND OF DANGER A MOTIONS AND YET. WHEN WE KNOW PRISONERS ARE RELEASED? WE WANT TO DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN TO GET THEM FUNCTIONING BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE -- LIVING SOMEWHERE. AND SO I APPRECIATE THIS THANK YOU AND I SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO JUST ADD -- WE ON HOW BORED SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS BUT CERTAINLY -- FOR THE COMMUNITY OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STABILIZE OR SITUATIONS AND REALLY APPRECIATE. THE AUTHORS LEADERSHIP AND THE SPONSORS LEADERSHIPS AS WELL SO LET ME ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS SEC FASTER I BUT WE HAVE A QUORUM GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTATION THANK YOU SIR.

AND THAT'S ONE THIRTY NINE CORRECT YES HI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I WANT TO THE FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ARE STILL FUN THIS BILL I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE THIRTY NINE THE EMERGENCY AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING ACT. AS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES WE NEED EVERY COMMUNITY TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. THIS BILL UPDATES CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING ELEMENT LAW TO REFLECT THE STATE'S HOMELESS CRISIS AND THE NEED FOR EVERY COMMUNITY. TO BETTER ASSESS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FACING HOMELESSNESS AND IMPLEMENT MORE TARGETED TRANSITION STRATEGIES TO LONG TERM PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THESE CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY IN ZONE AND NOW SITES TO ACCOMMODATE IT'S EXTREMELY LOW INCOME REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS AND THE MOST RECENT HOME. AND THE MOST RECENT HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNT WITH ME TODAY WE OF NICOLE WAR WAR ON MON ON HAD BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND RON KINGSTON ON BEHALF OF THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF ORANGE COUNTY. ON AND WILL GO AHEAD AND START WITH NICOLE. HERE. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF AB -- ONE THIRTY NINE THIS MEASURE PRIORITIZES LOCAL ASSESSMENT AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN A TIMELY MANNER. HOMELESSNESS IS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT ISSUES FACING ORANGE COUNTY. IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE COUNTY UTILIZED NEW TECHNOLOGY. USING CELLPHONES IN DUTCH IT'S HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNT TOGETHER THE MOST ACCURATE DATA ON THE SCOPE OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE COUNTY. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE RELEASED ACTUALLY TODAY SHOWING THAT THE POINT IN TIME COUNT HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY. THE INFORMATION OBTAINED CONFIRMS THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ENDING HOMELESSNESS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AB ONE THIRTY NINE KEEP UPDATED DATA AND LOCAL NEEDS ON THE FOREFRONT OF DISCUSSIONS OF HOMELESSNESS. THEREFORE THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- JUST AN AYE VOTE ON THE MEASURE THE SECOND [inaudible] MR. TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I TO SEE IF THERE WERE SOME FOR MORE THAN ONE HERE. I'M RUN KINGSTON IREPRESENT THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION ORANGE COUNTY POLICE TO SUPPORT. MISS QUIRK SILVA IS BUILD. HOMELESSNESS IS A MATTER THAT NEEDS TO BE CONTINUALLY UPDATED THIS IS NOT MY COULD. ALL THE OF VALUATION THAT IT GOES INTO THE HOUSING ELEMENT. THIS CHANGES SO FAST SO QUICKLY THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT VERY VERY ISSUE -- AND BY BY DOING THIS THE HOUSING ELEMENT HAS TO BE REVISED CONTINUALLY AS OPPOSED TO ONCE EVERY EIGHT YEARS THAT'S WAY TOO LONG. MR CHOOSE DISTRICT -- THERE IS A SHELTER THAT WAS SAID. DISCUSSED AND DECIDED ON JUST YESTERDAY HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL. BUT NONE THE LESS IT HAD TO BE DONE. YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN WE SEE THAT THE TRANSITIONAL PART OF HOMELESSNESS -- NEEDS TO BE CONTINUALLY UPDATED THIS BILL CANCERS AND SPEAKS TO THAT AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THE MASK OF THEIR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. ACCORDING TO RURAL CALIFORNIA PURPOSES USUALLY. ARE THERE OTHERS. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. THE SPRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I THANK THE AUTHOR OF FOR YOUR DEEP COMMITMENT A FOCUS ON HOW WE ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS PERFECTLY AND IN IN YOUR PART OF THE STATE'S I KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS ARE THE REAL SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS LONG TERM BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED. EMERGENCY SHELTERS TO HELP OUR RESIDENTS BE SAFE WHILE WE'RE WORKING TOWARD BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING I KNOW YOU THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS AND VERY MUCH LOOK FOR TO SUPPORT IT. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLOSE THAT AS WAS NOTED THAT THE POINT IN TYING COUNT FORMS CHEN COUNTY CAME OUT TODAY OR WAS RELEASED TODAY. AND FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHERE THERE WAS A CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THAT IS NOW INCREASED IN ORANGE COUNTY TO ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND SO THIS IS A SYDNEY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. AS WE KNOW. EVERY COUNTY IS GRAPPLING AND DEALING WITH -- HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS AND AS NOTED BY THE CHAIR EMERGENCY SHELTERS AREA STEP IN THE PROCESS BUT WE CERTAINLY NEED TO GET TO PERMANENT HOUSING AND THIS EFFORT WILL? ALLOW US. TO PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT ALSO COMPLETE THE PUZZLE WE HAVE TO HAVE CITIES ON BOARD WITH PLANNING SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT YOU'RE COUNTY MY COUNTY NOW SUFFER THE TERRIBLE COINCIDENCE OF HAVING THE SAME RECORD LEVELS OF HOMELESSNESS SO. THE COURT OUR WORK TOGETHER. WHEN WE GO TO YOUR THIRD AND FINAL BILL FOR TODAY -- AND THAT IS. FILE ITEM FOURTEEN AB EIGHT SIXTEEN OKAY. SEC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF ON THE SAME TOPIC IN A SINGLE ALMOST AS A BROKEN RECORD THIS YEAR YEAR FOR ME. NOT ONLY RELATED TO PERSONAL ISSUES BUT ALSO PUBLIC. WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH THE STATE THAT -- WHETHER IT'S ONE CITY ONE COUNTY. ONE AREA FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. RELATED FROM THE STATE WE ALL ARE LOOKING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS NOW MORE THAN EVER WE SEE THE URGENCY WITH MANY MANY PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS. IN OUR COUNTIES AND CITIES AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB. EIGHT SIXTEEN THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY PULL PROGRAM. THIS IS A HUGE UMBRELLA TO SAY. AS FAR AS FUNDING HOUSING ACROSS THE STATE HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS WE KNOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ARRAY OF NOT ONLY LEGISLATION. PROPOSALS BILLS AND ALSO RESOURCES BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. THAT THIS GETS TO WHERE IT NEEDS THE FUNDS GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND THAT WE HAVE COLLABORATION -- THIS BILL WILL CREATE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS QUICKLY WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND WHEN I NOTE THAT SOME SOME HAVE SAID TO ME ABOUT WHAT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PAY FOR SOMEBODY'S OF RENT THAT'S A TEMPORARY FIX. WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS WHEN WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE IN THERE? THEIR HOMES THAT BEING RENTED THAT WE SOLVE AN ISSUE BECAUSE ONCE SOMEBODY'S EVICTED IT BUT IT COULD COST UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PUT THEM BACK INTO A ROOM AND OTHER RENTAL AND MANY TIMES IT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN INFECTION ON THE RECORD -- IT WOULD PROVIDE FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR APARTMENTS IN THE PRIVATE MARKET AS WELL AS OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR AFFORDABLE PROJECTS LEASING UP OR EXISTING PROJECTS WITH AVAILABLE PARTNER. APARTMENTS. AB EIGHT SIXTEEN REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO CONSOLIDATE EXISTING PROGRAMS INTO ONE STREAMLINED. COMPETITIVE APPLICATION AND THAT IS MUCH. HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S EXCELLENT PEOPLE WORKING RIGHT NOW AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING BUT THIS WOULD. REALLY MAKE SOME EFFORTS TO AT TO WORK CLOSELY WITH CITIES AND THE STATE -- WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND SOPHIA REIS WITH BRILLIANT CORNERS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR NUMBERS -- CHRIS MORNING OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA -- ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF AB ONE SIX THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING PROGRAM. HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS A NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS HOMELESS. AND EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF INCOME HAS A SAFE STABLE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING PROGRAM AND EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE. IN MODEL APPROACH TO AND HOMELESSNESS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA FUNDED EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AT SIX DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS EACH WITH DIFFERENT GOALS AND POPULATION TARGETS. AS A RESULT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON RESPONSES FROM PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES STATEWIDE WAS AT OUR STATE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS COULDBE MORE COORDINATED AND MORE EFFECTIVE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FILL MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS REQUIRING DIFFERENT CRITERIA AND DIFFERENT DEADLINES. WITH NO CROSS AGENCY OR CROSS DEPARTMENT COLLABORATION. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALSO NOT USING EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS WHICH MEANS WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESSING. THE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY DECREASING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE AT THE RATE AND ADVOCACY THAT WE COULD. AS A RESULT. WE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE ON OUR STREETS AND SHELTERS AND CARS OR IN ON HABITABLE PLACES ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT OUR STATE'S GOAL SHOULD BE TO END HOMELESSNESS. AND WE INSURE. ENSURE THAT WHEN AT ANYONE EXPERIENCES A LOSS OF HOUSING IT IS RARE AND IT IS BRIEF. WITH THIS NEW FLEXIBLE PROGRAM THE STATE COULD ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY COMBINING SERVICES AND PROGRAMS PROVEN TO DECREASE HOMELESSNESS INTO ONE FUNDING. FOR THIS FUNDING FOR WOULD BE A ONE STOP SHOP FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND CONTINUUM OF CARE TO ACCESS VIA ONE STREAM STREAMLINED EDUCATE APPLICATION. THE POOL IS MEANT TO BE FLEXIBLE IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD PROVIDING GRANTS TO AND HOMELESSNESS. AS THE MEMBER SAID THROUGH RENTAL ASSISTANCE LANDLORD INCENTIVES OPERATING SUBSIDIES SERVICES SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS AN INTERIM INTERVENTIONS. AND A FLEXIBLE AND EFFECTIVE FLEXIBLE HOUSING PROGRAM WITH THESE SERVICES REQUIRES PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND LOCAL COORDINATION TWO THINGS THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED IN HIS BUDGET AS GOALS TO HELP AND HOMELESSNESS. IN FACT OUR LEGISLATION LAYS OUT A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM THAT WOULD SET INCENTIVIZE. JOINT APPLICATIONS IN COMMUNITIES AS OPPOSED TO PERPETUATING SILOS BETWEEN CITIES COUNTIES AND CEO SEES SUCH PARTNERSHIPS AND COORDINATION ARE CRUCIAL IF WE ARE TO TRULY MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING SINGLE ADULTS FAMILIES THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS PEOPLE EXITING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN OLDER ADULTS. I WANT TO CLARIFY ONE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN. THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT ELIMINATE THOSE EIGHTEEN PROGRAMS THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BECAUSE THOSE ARE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED THROUGH ONE TIME FUNDS. IN CONCLUSION WE ALL KNOW THIS THE SOLUTION TO AND HOMELESSNESS IS A HOME WE COMMEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL. AS THIS PROGRAM BILLS OFF THE SUCCESS OF THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL IN LOS ANGELES ADMINISTERED BY BRILLIANT CORNERS I'M GOING TO PASS IT TO MY COLLEAGUES OF FEAR RISE FROM REALLY CORNERS TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THAT PROGRAM. HIS HOUSE OVER SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE SINCE ITS INCEPTION BEFORE YOUPROCEED I WANT TO CATCH THIS MOMENT WITH FIVE MEMBERS THAT MAKE UP QUORUM ASK MADAM SECRETARY TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FOR QUORUM. TO HEAR TO HEAR DEEP HERE THE PIER GABRIEL. GLORIA. GLORIA HERE KILEY LEE MONTH. LIMóN HERE MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK SILVA HERE THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE QUORUM PLEASE. THANKS CHRIS AND AND THANK YOU SOMETHING MEMBER -- QUIRK SILVA AND THANKS TO THE CHAIR MEMBERS I AM SO IF YOU'RE REYES AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL OF LA COUNTY. AT BRILLIANT CORNERS AND ONE IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF OUR FLEXIBLE AND HEARD YOUR SUPPORT. FOR EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN SO WE BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF SEED MONEY FROM THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. THE CONRAD AND HEALTH AND FOUNDATION AND COUNTY SUPERVISOR MARK RIDLEY THOMAS IS OFFICE. BUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE'VE EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY AND WE NOW HAVE CONTRIBUTIONS. SEVERAL OTHER COUNTY AGENCIES AS WELL AS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND A MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION. NOW OUR ANNUAL BUDGET JUST FOR ONE YEAR IS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE A TRUE POOL OF FUNDING RESOURCES. WE HOUSE OVER SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND HUGE PART OF THAT SUCCESS IS THAT WE CAN BE VERY NIMBLE WITH OUR FUNDING. THE FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE ALLOWS US TO IMMEDIATELY ENTER INTO HOMING IN A HOLDING AGREEMENTS WITH LANDLORDS AND BEGIN PAYING AS SOON AS WE FIND APARTMENTS. WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR WHAT OUR CLIENTS NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT TO KEEP THEM HOUSE AND AND STABLE. WE ALSO HAVE A SPECIALIZED HUMAN HOUSING PROFESSIONALS THAT WORK TO RECRUIT LANDLORD PARTNERS LOS ANGELES IS COVERING ABOUT 3% VACANCY ATE SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLY TIGHT HOUSING MARKET. BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECRUIT NEW LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT THE SUBSIDY EVERY SINGLE MONTH. OUR TENDENCY SUPPORT TEAM ALSO WORKS WITH ANY HOUSING STABILITY ISSUES WHICH HELPS ENCOURAGE REPEAT BUSINESS AS WELL. THROUGH THIS RELATIONSHIP BUILDING WE'VE EVEN HAD A LITTLE BIT OF SUCCESS IN CONVINCING SOME OF OUR LANDLORDS TO CONVERT THEIR SUBSIDY FROM ONE OF OUR FLEXIBLE VOUCHERS TO A FEDERAL VOUCHER. BY OFFERING SOME INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND GUARANTEE THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WILL REMAIN ON SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE FLEX POOL TO ENCOURAGE -- USE OF FEDERAL RESOURCES -- TO AS CHRIS SAID BEFORE ME I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN DESERVES A PLACE TO CALL HOME THIS IS SOLUTION IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY GUARANTEES THAT WE CAN AND HOMELESSNESS FOR THOUSANDS OF OUR NEIGHBORS I SEE IT WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE HOUSING SUBSIDY PROGRAM WILL CHANGE LIVES AND COMMUNITIES FOR THE BETTER THANKS. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT SUPPORT THE BILL.

THIS ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR CONTINUED AND DOG ADVOCACY AROUND THIS ISSUE I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT CREATING -- A MORE COMPREHENSIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR FOLKS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- I ALSO KNOW YOU HAVE A BUDGET REQUEST IN AND WISH YOU. WELL ON THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THAT -- ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU LIKE TO MAKE -- AGAIN THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL BEING FLEXIBLE WITH THE FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE FROM THE STATE AND EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS THOSE LOCAL SOLUTIONS THAT WE AT THE STATE CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT IS.

A CHAIRMAN CHIU JUST MENTIONED IN TERMS OF HIS OWN COMMUNITY I'VE SEEN A 40% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF MY DISTRICT -- YOU SEE THE TENT CITIES YOU SEE THE INVISIBLE HOMELESSNESS -- YOU SEE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN -- K. EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SO WE HAVE A REAL CHALLENGE HERE -- YOU KNOW IN MANY CITIES THE MOST COMMONLY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA ON HOMELESSNESS IS THE POINT IN TIME COUNT WHICH IS BEEN DISCUSSED AS COMMITTEE AND MANY TIMES. I WHICH IS CONDUCTED IN COORDINATION WITH US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. THESE COUNTS ARE USED BY CITIES COUNTIES -- GOVERNMENT AGENCIES -- TO DEVELOP SERVICES AROUND AND TARGET THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION -- AND TO COMMUNICATE INFORMATION ABOUT HOMELESSNESS TO THE PUBLIC -- WE KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH THESE COUNTS HOWEVER -- AND THE UNDER COUNTER HOMELESS POPULATION WHICH THEN IMPACTS THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE GONNA -- PROVIDE -- FOR OUR OUR HOMELESS NEIGHBORS -- AND FRIENDS -- SO THE LACK OF CONSISTENT RELIABLE INFORMATION -- DOES PROVIDE A CHALLENGE AND BASICALLY WHAT MY BILL WOULD DO AB FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR WOULD BE TO CREATE. A STATEWIDE STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR REPORTING AT REGULAR INTERVALS A SPECIFIC DATA ON HOMELESSNESS ON THE INFORMATION WOULD INCLUDE THE HOMELESS IS DEMOGRAPHICS MOBILITY AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. OF THE CURRENT AND PROJECTED SUPPLY VARIOUS ACCOMMODATION UNITS FOR HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND SECURE POPULATIONS. OF THE NUMBER OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS EXTREMELY LOW HOUSING UNITS AND EMERGENCY SHELTER BEDS WITHIN EACH COUNTY. AND THE GOAL IS REALLY TO CREATE STATEWIDE STANDARDIZED DATA TO THEN -- INFORM HOPEFULLY A REGIONAL APPROACH ON HOMELESSNESS I WOULD BE -- THE END GOAL YOU KNOW IN MY CITY OF BERKELEY THEY'RE GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE SO IS OAKLAND SOS EMERYVILLE IF WE CAN WORK REGIONALLY -- AND TO DEAL WITH% THIS I THINK WEBETTER SHOT IF A FIXING IT SO -- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL WHICH HAS BEEN -- OUR SPONSOR ON THIS BILL AND WE WE WE RECEIVE OTHER SUPPORT FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL BUT BARRY COUNSELS A SPONSOR.

THE REPORT FOUND PRIMARILY THAT CALIFORNIA LAGS FAR BEHIND OUR PEER MEASURES IN THE EAST COAST IN THE MIDWEST AND PROVIDING SHELTER TO ARE HOMELESS POPULATIONS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SIMILAR OVERALL RATES. OF HOMELESSNESS AND ON SHELTERED HOMELESSNESS HAS LED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. PRIMARILY THE HOMELESS THEMSELVES. TO SOLVING THIS REQUIRE THIS CRISIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A FACT BASED CONVERSATION BASED OFF OF STANDARDIZED -- AND COMPATIBLE DATA ACROSS COUNTIES AB FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENTTO CREATE STANDARDS AND DEFINITIONS FOR THE CREATION OF REGIONAL HOMELESSNESS MANAGEMENT PLANS. THOSE PLANS TO BE COMPLETED EVERY TWO YEARS IN COORDINATION WITH THE POINT TIME COUNTS. AND WOULD CREATE APPLES TO APPLES DATA. ON VARIOUS -- ELEMENTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC MOBILITY AND RESOURCE INFORMATION ON HOMELESSNESS. AND WITH THE STANDARDIZED DATA POLICY MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC WILL BE BETTER EMPOWERED TO IDENTIFY REGIONAL TRENDS AND HOMELESSNESS AND THE SCALE PUBLIC SERVICES MOST APPROPRIATELY.

WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BUILDING MORE HOMES I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING IN THE STATE -- SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF HOUSING -- AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS -- MANY WHICH I'M SUPPORTING TO TO ADDRESS THAT -- BUT WE ALSO THINK MORE CREATIVELY AROUND ENSURING THAT WE GET -- AFFORDABLE -- AND LOW INCOME HOUSING -- YOU KNOW IN THE BAY AREA THE CITY BILL COMES BEGAN CONVERTING THEIR EXISTING RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS INTO AFFORDABLE UNITS. AND THIS IS THE BENEFIT OF PROTECTING RESIDENTS AND THEIR HOMES AND IS QUICKER AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN BUILDING. AT NEW RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AT THE BILL THAT I AM OFFERING HERE. AND THE CITY OF OAKLAND IS THE THE SPONSOR OF A SOME IT'LL -- SEVEN TWENTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE PROPERTY OWNERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERT EXISTING BUILDINGS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SHARDS SIGNIFICANTLY LAWRENCE IN RETURN FOR A LOW FOR LOWER OVERALL PROPERTY TAX LIABILITY -- SO THAT'S THE THE GOAL OF THE BILL AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I WANT TO TURN IT OVER. TO NUCLEAR DELUCA FROM THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO TESTIFY AS WELL. IN CHIU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NICOLO DELUCA HERE MAY HAVE OPEN MAYOR IN STRONG SUPPORT ONE I THINK SIMPLY MEMBER WICKS FOR ALL OF HER LEADERSHIP WANT TO THANK.

EIGHT THANKS IN RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE A GREAT THANK YOU. I MOVE THE BILL THIS IS GERMAN IF YOU WANTED OKAY THERE'S A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL I GUESS I COULD SECOND IT. MADAM SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL THE TWO OF US. NOW WHETHER JUST TWO OF US BUT WE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MOTION A SECOND IT SO YOU'LL HAVE TO VOTES. TO GET A CALL THE MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CHIU. HI CHIU I DAVE HI I GABRIELLE. GLORIA KILEY LEE MON MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK SILVA. LET'S TAKE MISS FRIEDMAN. FILE ITEM TEN AB [inaudible] SIX SEVENTY WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER TERM MEMBERS I APPRECIATE YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE WORKING WITH US ON THIS LEGISLATION. I BELIEVE THAT THE CREATION OF EIGHTY USES A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OF SOLVING OUR HOUSING CRISIS -- IT'S EXACTLY. ONE OF THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO GETTING MORE -- HOUSING ONLINE TO ALSO BRING FAMILIES -- AND PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T OTHERWISE AFFORD TO LIVE IN SOME OF OUR SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN ENJOY SCHOOLS AND RECREATION AND EVERYTHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE. ENJOY -- AND WHEN THE STATE PASSED THEIR LOSS -- THE COURAGE AND EIGHTY YOU STATEWIDE I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS EVER THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENTION TO ALLOW SMALL GROUPS OF PROPERTY OWNERS TO IGNORE THE LAW BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED -- THERE'S OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND COMMUNITY IN THE INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATE THAT MAKE UP OVER SIX MILLION TOTAL HOUSING UNITS WHICH IS ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE STATE'S HOUSING STOCK. RESIDENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE OFTEN BEEN DENIED THE ABILITY TO BUILD A SECOND UNIT BY H. O. A LOSS OR EACH YEAR IT TO A RULES DEPRIVING HOMEOWNERS POTENTIAL RENT. AND THE COMMUNITY OF IMPORTANT HOUSING SUPPLY. THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF HOMEOWNERS WITHIN THOSE H. O. O. A.'S WANTING TO HAPPY TO USE AND BEING TOLD THAT THE MUNICIPALITY IN THE CITY IS FINE WITH IT BUT THAT THEIR H. AWAY CONTRACTS PROHIBITED. AB SIX SEVENTY ALLOWS WERE APPROPRIATE THOSE HOMEOWNERS WHO WISH TO SEEK THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SECOND UNIT. TO HAVE -- ONE IT APPLIES TO ALL EXISTING GOVERNING DOCUMENTS AND ALLOWS REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS PROVIDING THAT THOSE RESTRICTIONS ON EFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT OR UNREASONABLY RESTRICT. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A OF AN EIGHTY YOU WERE JUNIOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT -- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO -- LIKE TO THE IDEA OF PROPERTY RIGHTS THIS IS REALLY ALLOWING HOMEOWNERS TO ENJOY THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE EXTENT THAT OTHER HOMEOWNERS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW. IN LIGHT OF OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS CALIFORNIA HAS TO SUPPORT HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO USE THEIR LAND TO CREATE NOR HAVE MORE HOUSING TO DO SO. AND THIS IS A WAY THAT REALLY IS RESPONSIBLE AND DOESN'T IMPACT OTHER HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF COURSE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT EIGHTY USING JUNIOR EIGHTY USE. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS DAVID JONES REPRESENTING THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. YOUR WITNESS THANK YOU MISTER MEMBER DAVID JONES ABOUT THE DOW TRUCK YOU'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US TO CRAFT WHAT WE THINK IS A VERY REASONABLE BUILT. AS THE MEMBER MENTIONED A HOUSING CRISIS IS REACHED EPIC PROPORTIONS OF THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE IS UNIQUE IS IT'S GOT TWENTY FIVE MILES OF NATIONAL FOREST AROUND IT -- SO IT IS SEVERELY CONSTRICTED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AS THE MEMBER MENTIONED WE HAVE -- HOMEOWNERS COMING TO THE COUNCIL ASKING TO SEE THEY CAN HAVE AN EIGHTY YOU OF MANY OF THEM LIVE IN THE BAY AREA THEY COMMUTE -- THEIR ABSENT FROM THEIR THEIR PROPERTY DURING THE A SEVERAL WEEKS THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIVING THERE WATCHING THEIR HOUSE AND THEIR LOOK ACROSS THE STREET. FOR PROPERTIES AT APART IN AGE EIGHT EIGHT H. O. S. AND THEY HAVE AN EIGHTY WHEN THEY DON'T -- THIS WE BELIEVE IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH IT ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS WHO CHOOSE TO NOBODY'S FORCED TO THE OPTION OF HAVING AN EIGHTY YOU WE RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF H. O. A.'S TO HAVE THEIR RESTRICTIONS WHEN REASONABLE. FOR INSTANCE IF IT WAS A SENIOR ONLY -- H. AWAY -- CLEARLY A SENIORS WOULD BE RESTRICTED FROM BEING IN THOSE EIGHTY YOU SO. WE THINK IT STRIKES A REASONABLE AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN MAINTAINING THE CHARACTER OF THE AESTHETICS OF THE COMMUNITY ALLOWING WHERE APPROPRIATE -- EIGHTY USED TO BE BUILT AND CONSTRUCTED WHERE THOSE HOMEOWNERS WOULD LIKE TO DO SO AND WITH THAT WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND ASK FOR MY VOTE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE -- AND STATE A STAFFER WORKING ON THIS BILL I AGREE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CHALLENGES PEOPLE FACE TO SECURING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OFTEN PEOPLE CAN MEET THE MONTHLY COST ASSOCIATE WITH THEIR HOUSING BUT THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY NEEDED UP FRONT IS A BARRIER. THE RISING DEMAND FOR MORE HOUSING IS COUPLED WITH THE NEED TO MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE. AND WE KNOW THE RENT AND CALIFORNIA -- ALREADY CHALLENGES OUR DEFINITION OF AFFORDABLE. THE BURDEN OF HIGH RANK COUPLE WITH OTHER NECESSARY COST OF LIVING THESE LITTLE INCOME AVAILABLE FOR MANY TO AFFORD THE INITIAL MOVING COSTS WITH SECURING HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FORTY PROVIDES MORE TAX INCENTIVES TO HOMEOWNERS IN THE FORM OF PROPERTY IN MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX DEDUCTIONS. THAT IT DOES FOR RENTERS ABOUT FOURTEEN DOLLARS TO HOMEOWNERS VERSES ONE DOLLAR FOR RENTERS. MOVING COSTS SUCH AS SECURITY DEPOSITS AND FIRST MONTH'S RENT ASSOCIATE WAS SECURING RENTAL HOUSING CAN COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO HAVE ON HAND WHICH IS ON A BOARD UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AB FOR THIRTY SEVEN WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE THE MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE TO COVER THESE MOVING COSTS. INCREASE HOW THE SECURITY REDUCE HOMELESS IN OUR HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MAY I ASK A FEW OF SUPPORTERS THE BILL.

I WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF REMAINING ISSUES FIRST WOULD BE THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHICH WOULD INVALIDATE THE TRANSFERS OF SURPLUS LAND THAT DID NOT -- FOLLOW THE SURPLUS LAND ACT THAT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO BOTH ENSURE AS WELL AS MARKET OUR LAND. THAT'S ALSO PUNITIVE ON THE BONA FIDE PURCHASERS OF THE LAND ADDITIONALLY I WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF INFORMAL AS WELL AS FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS IN THE BILL THAT WOULD.

FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX CERTAINLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAMS A RECENT AMENDMENTS TO ELIMINATE LEASES FROM LEGISLATION WHICH WAS. PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME ONGOING CONCERN SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING HAVING TO DO WITH LAND USE COMPATIBILITY. I'M COUNTIES ARE CHARGED WITH ZONING AND PLANNING FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES AND CERTAINLY THERE DO EXIST COUNTY LANCE -- THAT MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR HOUSING SO WE'RE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A CONTINUE CONVERSATION -- ABOUT WHICH COUNTY ON PROPERTIES MIGHT BE SUITABLE -- SO WE'RE NOT. NOT OPPOSED TO CAN DOING THAT THAT CONVERSATION -- WE ARE INTERESTED IN -- CRAFTING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PUT US IN A POSITION WHERE WE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO A DISCUSSION WITH AUTHORS OFFICE THANK YOU SO MUCH COUNTIES ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. I'M WE AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS OUTLINED BY CSTA AND ON THE LAND USE PROVISIONS I DO THINK WE'RE ALSO OPEN TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT.

OF BAKER WAS GERMAN AYE AYES HAVE A MAYBE A QUESTION FOR OUR OUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT -- COMING FROM A SPECIAL DISTRICT BACKGROUND -- SANITARY WATER DISTRICT OF DURING MY DAYS -- AT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE ALWAYS SET ASIDE LAND. THAT -- WE WE KNOW THAT IT IS FOR FUTURE EXPANSIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE A AT AT THE LOCAL SANITATION DISTRICT THERE ARE THERE ARE LAND WHAT THAT'S VACANT BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEEDED -- TO CREATE. FUTURE CAPACITY FOR PROCESSING -- DOES THIS BILL [inaudible] AWAY. WITH THAT THAT THAT THAT SAFEGUARD FOR SPECIAL DISTRICT WHEN THEY KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW OF WITH WITH INCREASING POPULATIONS. OVER WOULD CAUSE STATISTICALLY EVEN EVEN SOME AIRPORTS OR SET UP A SPECIAL DISTRICTS WHERE. A THE SURPLUS LAND LAND OR IN PLACE FOR FUTURE EXPANSION AND ITEM I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THIS BILL DOESN'T TAKE THAT -- THAT ABILITY AWAY FROM SPECIAL DISTRICT. FOR FUTURE EXPANSION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY. A SERVICE ARGUED CONSTITUENTS. COURTESY AUTHOR IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY SO -- NO FOR FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN ACTUALLY TURNER MICHAEL SORRY FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS IT ABSOLUTELY DOES. CONTINUE TO ALLOW. ANY SPECIAL DISTRICT OR ANY GOVERNMENT ENTITY TO HOLD LAND THAT WILL CONTINUE -- TO FOR FOR OPERATIONS PURPOSES SO I STOPPED A LITTLE. I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS WHEN. THE LAND IS BEING DISPOSED THAT THE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL GOES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT -- THAT WAS CODIFIED INTO LAW IN 2014% TWENTY FOURTEEN THERE'S BEEN. NUMEROUS EXAMPLES AT LEAST EVEN IN THE BAY AREA PROBABLY EVEN MORE ONCE WE LOOK STATEWIDE BUT THE CITY OF OAKLAND. DECIDED TO TRY TO CIRCUMVENT THAT LAW. YEARS AFTER THE FACT WITH THE PRIVATE DEVELOPER THEY DID TO THE LAWSUIT -- WE HAVE ALSO THE THE CALTRAIN SITE RIGHT BY THE HEY WE'RE PARK STATION WHICH IS AND AND SORT OF THE EAST BAY OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN THEY ARE WORK EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE MARKET RATE DEVELOPER INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER WE HAVE THE CITY OF BURLINGAME WITH THE CREATED HEALTH DISTRICT ON THE SIDE OF A FORMER. PUBLIC HEALTH BILL WITH THE PROPOSED TO BUILD A SENIOR INDEPENDENT LIVING SPACE -- CENTER WITH NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO SO AGAIN -- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST AVOID -- DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT ENTITIES FROM JUST GOING AROUND WHAT WAS READY CODIFIED AT LAW. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY -- OTHER COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES. LET ME JUST SAY TWO OF THE AUTHOR APPRECIATE YOUR CHURCH YOUR CHAMPIONING OF HOW WE ENSURE THAT ALL SURPLUS LANDS ARE USED -- AS WE CAN TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW I KNOW THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT'S KAREN FOR MANY OF THE GOVERNOR'S OBJECTIVES IN HIS RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER -- AND I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE AND SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE DOING AND I LOOK FOR TO WAS SUPPORTING THIS. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. WE HAVE A MOTION. IS THERE MOTION FOR THE BILL OF A MOVE THE BILL IS THEIR SECOND. GERMANS ARE SECOND THE BILL MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS TO HI. HI DAVE NOT VOTING. NINE OR IN. GABRIEL GABRIEL I GLORIA KILEY LEE MON MAIENSCHEIN. MISSION AND BOARDING QUIRK SILVA. YOUR BILL HAS TWO VOTES AND WE'LL WAIT FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER TECH. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR OTHER AUTHORS. MR MAIENSCHEIN WILL BE PRESENTING FOR ATWATER GARCIA -- FOR FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN AB. TEN TEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AT TO PRESENT HIS BILL AB. TEN TEN AB TEN TEN WOULD ALLOW DULY CONSTITUTED GOVERNING BODIES OF A NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATION. RANCHERO TO BECOME -- ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SPECIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION IN THE NATION WITH NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IDENTIFIED IN WHOLE OR PART AS AMERICAN INDIAN IN THE RATE OF TRAVEL POVERTY IS MORE THAN TWICE THAT OF THE REST OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. AND ONE THIRD OF THESE RESIDENTS LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY -- LINE. CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES HAVE NOT BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR IN COMPETITIVE FOR MOST STATE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM GRANTS IN THE PAST. RECENTLY H. C. D. AS BE GONE PROPOSING REGULATION CHANGES INCLUDING TRIBAL ACCESS TO THE HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM. WELL TRIBES ARE EXPLICITLY ELIGIBLE FOR SOME STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS THE TERMINOLOGY USED TO REFER TO TRIBES IS INCONSISTENT AND CONFUSING. WITH OTHER -- PROGRAMS OMITTING TRIBES AND TRIBAL ENTITIES AS ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS ALTOGETHER ADDITIONALLY -- WE DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AND THAT HAVE SEVERAL WITNESSES HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY -- AND IT IS FOR A REASON THESE REASONS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN -- CHIU VICE CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME'S AT WHAT SOUNDS AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION. FOR RURAL HOUSING WE'VE BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AS AN ADVOCATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I RURAL CALIFORNIA. DURING THAT TIME AND ESPECIALLY THE LAST DECADE WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH -- TRIBES AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO HELP -- INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST HAS THE LARGEST POPULATION OF NARAL NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE IN THE COUNTRY. AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS REALLY CRITICAL -- FOR THE TRAVEL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. IN A ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE HAD LOOKED OUT AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES IS INCREASING THIS ACCESS. TO STATE. FUNDING -- FOR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO TAKE CONTROL AND TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OF FOR THEIR MEMBERS I WE'VE HAD SOME LIMITED SUCCESS -- OF ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT THE TRIBES ARE ELIGIBLE WE WE'VE RECENTLY HAD. ONE OH LORD AND THE LAST DECADE -- THAT WENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM THE HOME -- INVESTMENT. A AN IMPROVEMENT ACT AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS BASICALLY -- INCREASES ELIGIBILITY THE PROGRAMS WERE TRIBES ARE ELIGIBLE. AND SORT OF IMPROVES THE DEFINITION OF TRIBES IN SOME OF THE CIRCUITOUS ROUTES THAT TRIBE STATE TO LOOK AT HOW THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS. SO YOU KNOW TRIBES ARE REFERRED TO IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF OF THE CODE -- AS AS MAY BE A SPONSOR OR DEVELOPER OR A LOCAL HOUSING ENTITIES SO THIS. A BILL MAINLY ATTEMPTS TO CLEAN UP SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE AND EXTENDS TO A FEW OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE -- AT A MEETING TRIBES EITHER BY -- JUST MAYOR OVERSIGHT OR YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY WEREN'T CONSIDERED AS A COMMUNITY THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THESE FUNDS -- ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THE ELIGIBILITY IS NOT ONLY -- AN ISSUE BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO ACCESS SOME OF THESE FUNDS ARE STILL SOME BARRIERS WILL NEED TO WORK OUT BUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THIS BILL DOES IS THAT RECONSTITUTE THE CALIFORNIA NEED ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRIBES -- THE STATUTE IS ALREADY THERE THAT SORT OF ALLOWS -- FOUR EIGHT CD TO DO THIS BUT THIS AMENDMENT -- DIRAC'S ATD TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO HELP TRIBES -- ACCESS -- THESE POTENTIAL NEW FUNDS COMING DOWN TO EVERYBODY. SO WHAT WERE -- BASICALLY ASKING FOR IS NOT ONLY CLARIFICATION OF THIS LANGUAGE. BUT THE RE CONSTITUTION OF THAT CALIFORNIAN INSISTENCE A PROGRAM. THAT TRIES TO GET SOME FEDERAL ASSISTANCE -- OF THE OVER HUNDRED TRIBES IN IN CALIFORNIA -- PARKS ME ONLY A 25% OF THEM ONLY GET LIKE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER YEAR FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS DOESN'T GO VERY FAR IN CALIFORNIA THE SEARS SO TRIBES AT THE SAME OVER FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS. IN ORDER TO DO ONE UNIT THAT WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO GIVE TRIBES ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR SOME OF THESE OTHER FUNDS. TO HELP -- ADDRESS THIS CRISIS THAT WERE EXPERIENCING IN CALIFORNIA TOGETHER. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER -- TO JAMIE THE FAMILY -- HE IS ACTUALLY WORKS THAT DIRECTLY IN COMMUNITIES AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MEDIAN HOUSING ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE INTERMENT -- MY NAME IS JAMIE NOMINUM I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR NORTHERN CIRCLING AND HOUSING AUTHORITY. WE HAVE SEVEN MEMBER TRIBES THAT ARE PART OF THE CONSORTIUM THAT WE HAVE THERE -- FIVE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY AND TWO OVER IN BUTTE COUNTY. AND THE PURSUIT OF THIS BILL WOULD HELP -- IN CAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE TRIBE SAYS AS MISTER -- SAMPSON ALLUDED. TO A LOT OF THE TRIBES ARE SMALL AND DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES TO PULL FROM. QUESTION REGARDS -- TO FUNDS TO BUILD A NEW DEVELOPMENTS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF REHAB AND MODERNIZATION WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ALONG THE SIDE THAT -- BUT ALSO CAPACITY BUILDING AND UNDERSTANDING -- WHAT'S AVAILABLE -- WHAT TYPES OF RESOURCES ARE -- OUT THERE AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO ASSIST -- OTHER TRIBES HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WERE A PART OF THE NEVADA CALIFORNIA INDIAN HOUSING ASSOCIATION AND SO WE DO A LOT OF ADVOCACY WORK FOR THE TRIBES HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE A RECIPIENT OF THE HOME FUNDS WE WILL BE BUILDING A QUAD PLEX -- IN THE HOPMAN AREA -- BUT THAT'S JUST -- ONE SUCCESS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET -- AND IN RECENT YEARS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS A KIND OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AND PROVIDE THOSE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TRIBES THAT WE SERVICE IN THE AREA SO YOUR CONSIDERATIONS GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS BUYING ACOSTA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION.

SEVENTEEN OH TO THE HOMELESS CORNING FINANCING COUNCIL AS MENTION WAS CREATED IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THE COUNCIL CREE CONSISTS OF NINETEEN MEMBERS. THEY WERE TASKED WITH OVERSEEING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING FIRST GUIDELINES BY JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ADMINISTERING STATE PROGRAMS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO JULY. ONE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARE REQUIRED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE COUNCIL TO REVISE OR ADOPT GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS THAT INCORPORATE THE CORE COMPONENTS OF HOUSING FIRST. IF THE GUIDELINES. OF THE EXISTING GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS DO NOT ALREADY INCORPORATE THE CORE COMPONENTS OF HOUSING FIRST. BEFORE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE COUNCIL DID NOT HAVE STAFF DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DUTIES OF THE COUNCIL AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM. THE COUNCIL WAS ELEVATED TO THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY AND GIVEN THREE FULL TIME AND THREE PART TIME STAFF. AT A RECENT COUNCIL MEETING THE THE COUNCIL RELEASED TO THEIR AMBITIOUS TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN ACTION PLAN WHICH INCLUDES COLLUDED. DISTRIBUTING THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE HE PROGRAM DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A STATEWIDE HOMELESS INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM DEVELOPING A DATA DRIVEN EVIDENCE BASED HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC PLAN TO STOP THE GROWTH.

THE COUNCIL PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENDING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU CAN TELL BY THEIR AMBITIOUS ACTION PLAN THEY HAVE AN ACT THEY'RE UP FOR AN ACTIVE YEAR. IT IS CRITICAL FOR THE COUNCIL TO BE GIVEN THE ADEQUATE STAFFING TO MEET THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS WE MUST STRENGTHEN STRENGTHEN STRENGTHEN THE HOMELESS COORDINATING A FINANCING COUNCILS CAPACITY TO DO ALL THEIR WORK. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS HOUSING CALIFORNIA'S PLACES SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND DRIVER.

AB -- SEVENTEEN OH TO WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO INCREASE THE STAFFING AND CAPACITY. OF THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. THIS IS I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. MEASURES ON HOMELESSNESS -- BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THIS SESSION BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH THE MONEY THAT -- THIS ASSEMBLY IS GOING TO APPROPRIATE WILL BE SPENT. AND IT IS THIS COUNCIL THAT MOVED. THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN HEAT MONEY THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR IT IS THE ENTITY IDENTIFIED BY THE GOVERNOR -- IN THE PROPOSED -- STATE BLOCK GRANT FOR THIS COMING YEAR. AND IT NEEDS THE THE RESOURCES -- TO IMPLEMENT AND SPEND THAT MONEY WELL. OUR CALIFORNIA'S NOT DOING. WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE? WHOSE ONLY CRIME OR CENTER COMMON BOND IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE OUT ON THE STREETS WITH NO WHERE TO GO. AND DESPERATELY AND LEGITIMATELY IN NEED OF HELP. AND SO -- IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE MONEY. AND IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR PUT INTO HIS BUDGET -- IN JANUARY WE IF WE AS A PROVIDER LINES THINK. THE ASSEMBLY GOT IT RIGHT LAST YEAR WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS A SUGGESTED SPENDING LEVEL IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE. INVESTING IN THE COUNCIL THAT'S GOING TO THEN MAKE SURE THAT MONEY IS TARGETED TO THE THE CITIES IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE.

TO ADVANCE THE RIGHTS OF FAMILIES TO LIVE IN COMMUNITIES WITH GOOD JOBS AND GOOD SCHOOLS AND GOOD SERVICE AS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ETHNICITY OR INCOME -- I DON'T THINK ANY TO EXPLAIN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS ANYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE -- WE DIDN'T GET INTO THIS CRISIS ONE WAY IT WAS A LOT OF DECISIONS AND MARKET MECHANISMS THAT GOT US HERE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE WAY THAT WE GET OUT WE NEED A LOT OF TOOLS. AND A LOT OF POLICIES TO FIX THIS AND I THINK AB FIFTEEN SIXTY EIGHT CAN BE ONE OF THOSE TOOLS -- SIMPLY PUT FIFTEEN SIXTY EIGHT RECONDITION CERTAIN STATE GRANT FUNDS TO JURISDICTIONS CONTINGENT ON HAVING A COMPLAINT HOUSING ELEMENT -- CONDITIONING FUNDS THAT -- RECALCITRANT JURISDICTIONS WANT WILL HELP BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE. PUBLIC ADVOCATES HELPED CREATE THE WHEN BAY AREA GRANT PROGRAM IN DC AREA MEMBERS MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT. BUT LIKE AB FIFTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THIS PROGRAM CONDITION CERTAIN FUNDS BASED ON LOCAL JUST JURISDICTIONS ADVANCING THE BAY AREA'S LAND USE AND HOUSING GOALS. AND JURISDICTIONS MUST MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING HAVING A COMPLIANT HOUSING ELEMENT TO QUALIFY. BEFORE -- BAG. OVER TWENTY JURISDICTIONS IN THE BAY AREA DIDN'T HAVE COMPLAINED HOUSING ELEMENTS AND NOW NEARLY ALL OF THEM DO. THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED MANY CARROTS TO ENCOURAGE JURISDICTIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING ON HOUSING BUT SO FAR CARROTS HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH TO GET SOME JURISDICTIONS TO ACT. AB FIFTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THIS GIVES JURISDICTIONS PLENTY OF TIME TO DO THE RIGHT THING. COMEDY COMPLIANCE AND WITH THE STICK THANK YOU. ME ASK IF THERE THE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL CHAIRMAN CHIU. KEVIN -- I CONSIDER THE SMART LEGISLATION WATCHING OVER THE VARIOUS YEARS. YES WE HAVE SOME FUN OUTSIDE -- ANYWAY -- BUT ANYWAY -- DEALING WITH THIS I THINK IT'S GOOD LEGISLATION BECAUSE INDEED THE SHOULD WE SAY STICK IS OUT THERE TO WHAT AND THE REASONS WHY -- IN THE PAST YOU'VE NOT SEEN THIS AND I BELIEVE I KNOW I'M NOT VERY OFTEN AGREEMENT WITH THE TRADE IN THE ASSOCIATION -- I BELIEVE IT'S A GOOD EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THE UNDER -- THOUSAND SHOULD WE SEE DOLLAR RENTING ISSUE. AND HOLDS THE STE. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRIS LEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION THE BILL HAS TAKEN SORT OF AN INTERESTING PATH WE WENT FROM A VERY NARROWLY DEFINED STICK AS REGIONAL SAY. AND I'M A BIG TRIGGER THAT WOULD LIKELY WOULD HAVE CAUGHT UP NEARLY ALL JURISDICTIONS WE NOW SORT OF FLIP THAT AND WE HAVE EVEN INCREDIBLY BROAD STACK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL POTENTIAL STATE GRANT FUNDS. WITH A VERY NARROW EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION RELATED GRANTS AND CERTAIN HOUSING ELEMENT RELATED GRANTS AND SO THE ANTI HAS REALLY BEEN UP TO IN TERMS OF IF YOU LOOK AT THE SERVICES THAT COUNTIES PROVIDE. FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WATER SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE CAP AND TRADE AGRICULTURAL SERVICES WE NOW HAVE A BILL THAT'S INCREDIBLY BROAD IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL FUNDING THAT COULD BE WITHHELD FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR COUNTIES ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE MOVED FROM A STANDARD THAT WE DIDN'T% THINK VERY MANY JURISDICTIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO FEASIBLY MEET GIVEN OUR EXISTING FUNDING SHORTAGE. FOR BELOW MODERATE INCOME HOUSING -- AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STANDARDS FROM AB -- SEVENTY TWO SEES ACTED NOT OBJECT TO AB SEVENTY TWO WE DID REQUEST SOME AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE THE DUE PROCESS PROVISIONS INHERENT IN AB -- SEVENTY TWO AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A SPECIALLY NEEDED IN THIS BILL NOW BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RATHER THAN HAVING A PROCESS WHERE EACH CD IS GOING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND POTENTIALLY REFERRED JURISDICTIONS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- WE'RE NOT LEAVING UP TO THAT SAME ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS A REALLY MUCH STRONGER REMEDY WHICH IS WITHHOLDING THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR ALL STATE GRANTS I'M WE DO HAVE A SPECIFIC CONCERN WITH THE FACT THAT THE BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE A DEFINITION OF THE STATE GRANT. AS YOU KNOW COUNTIES PROVIDE A HUGE NUMBER OF THE STATE LEVEL SERVICES ESPECIALLY IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STATE. I'M A SPACE SO WE ESPECIALLY NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THE BILL DOESN'T APPLY TO ANYTHING IN REALIGNMENT THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE ABOUT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED REVENUES -- SOME REVENUES IN REALIGNMENT ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED OTHERS ARE NOT AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU KNOW OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. AT RISK -- THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN FOR US -- FINALLY ON THE DUE PROCESS PIECE I I REALLY THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN THIS BILL BECAUSE TWO OF THE ELEMENTS. IN THAT SUBDIVISION J. THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IN THE DENSITY BONUS LAW REALLY ARE MOVING TARGETS ALL RIGHT -- THERE'S PROPOSALS TO AMEND IN CITY BONUS NEARLY EVERY YEAR THERE'S BILLS THAT NEARLY WENT INTO EFFECT LAST YEAR THERE'S MORE UNDER CONSIDERATION THIS YEAR. AND SO THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL NON COMPLIANCE -- INCREASES WITH EACH LEGISLATIVE CHANGE THERE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I SEE SECONDS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ROBINSON WAS SHOT YOUR AND WE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION -- WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE INITIAL VERSION OF THIS BILL WHICH ATTEMPTED -- TO THIS HOLD THE FLOW TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE IN COMPLIANCE -- WE STILL REMAIN CONCERNED WITH THE BILL I DO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUCH AS THE PROHIBITION ON THE ACCESS TO CAP AND TRADE GRANTS ARE AGENCIES -- ARE ARE WELL FUNDED FROM A PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE TRANSIT INTERCITY REAL CAPITAL PROGRAM WHICH FUNDS TRANSITIVE PERMITS UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- INCLUDING STATION AREA DEVELOPMENT -- STATION DEVELOPMENT GRADE SEPARATIONS ELECTRIC BUSES EXCITE OR EXCEL -- AND WE THINK FRANKLY LIMITING ACCESS TO THAT PART OF FUNDING TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT IN SOME CASES DO RUN TRANSIT SERVICE OR ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE STATIONS AND GRADE SEPARATIONS -- FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE GOALS OF THIS STATE HAS SET THE POLICY GOALS OF STATUS AT TO BUILD MORE TRANSIT AND HOUSING. OR I SHOULD SAY BILL TRANSIT CLOSER TO HOUSING AND AND VICE VERSA SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN SEE IF THERE'S A WAY. TO ALSO EXCLUDE -- THOSE TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION GRANTS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THOSE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. OTHER OPPOSITION I BELIEVE IF ONE DOES HEAR BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS A CALIFORNIA WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY'VE TAKEN THUS FAR BUT WE DO ALSO SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT WERE OUTLINED. BY MISTER ROBINSON AND AND MISTER LEE -- IN THE GRANT FUNDING THAT IS OFTEN BLENDED WITH LOCAL REVENUES FOR PROJECTS AND THE CONTRACTORS WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BUILD AS MUCH AND SO IT'S A CONCERN SO. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR FOR THE WORK THUS FAR. MISTER MEMBERS DAVID JOHNSON HALF THE CITIES OF GLENDALE IN THE CITY'S MARIN WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF A C. SACK PRICKLY WITH DENSITY BONUS A LAW CHANGING. AND THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY LACK OF DUE PROCESS SO. WE WOULD ASK FOR AN OF A LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- LET ME JUST FIRST BY THANK START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR DEEP GAUGE BUT WITH OUR COMMITTEE ON THIS I KNOW YOU STARTED WITH A PROPOSAL -- THAT AT PROPOSED TINE SP ONE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AND THAT WAS A CONCEPT I WAS OPEN TO BUT CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK -- THROUGHOUT -- ARE LEGISLATURE ON THAT TOPIC AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AND FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE TOWARD. THIS NEW CONCEPT OF FOCUSING ON ON STATE GRANTS ONE THING I WOULD JUST MENTION AS I THINK IT'S CLEAR AND WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING -- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO REFINE THE DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT MEANS THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT I THINK THE CONCEPT IS -- ONE THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SUPPORT -- AS A WAY OF OF OF OF MAKING SURE THAT CITIES DO THE RIGHT THING SO -- VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON THIS TOGETHER LET ME ASK IF THERE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD LIKE. TO HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER GLORIA. JUST A QUICK COMMENT VERY ATTEND THE COMMENTS YOU MADE AS CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK IN HELPING GUIDE THE AUTHOR. AND AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO TO WALK TO REFINE THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE I THINK -- IN THE CONTEXT WHEN WE HEARD THIS I THINK IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM RELEASED THE CONCEPT OF IT. COMMITTEE DID NOT RESPOND WELL TO THAT WE SHOULD BE AUTHOR TAKING THAT IN A FEW GUYS RELATES TO GAS TAX. AND THE VOTERS RECENT ACTION I THINK A LOT OF US US A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO FEND THE ACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE PROMISING THE COMMITTEES WOULD BENEFIT FROM THOSE FUNDS. TAKING THOSE OFF THE TABLE WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE TO THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- BUT THE APPROACH CURRENTLY IN TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE -- MORE PERFORMANCE BASED GRANTS OR OR MORE ELECTED GRANTS -- I THINK A IS IS MORE OF THE RIGHT LINE YOU RAISE ISSUES THAT NEED CONTINUE DISCUSSION I TRUST MR MCCARTY WILL DO PRECISELY THAT -- BUT ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW COMMIT CITIES LIKE MY WHICH I KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE ALL OF MY CITIES OF MY DISTRICT ARE MEETING THEIR HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS. SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE THAT ARE TRYING THEY NEED TO SEE SOME SORT OF BENEFIT FROM THAT WHICH I THINK IS THE NATURE. OF THE BILL SO -- AGAIN I APPRECIATION TO MISTER MCCARTY FOR LISTENING TO THE PREVIOUS AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS COMMENTS ADJUSTING ACCORDINGLY NIGHT -- HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO THE PRODUCT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS REFINING THIS EVEN FURTHER AGAIN TO INCENTIVIZE COMMITTEE STEP UP FOR THE HOUSING RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES AND HOLDING THOSE THAT DON'T ACCOUNTABLE -- BY PROHIBITING THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR THESE -- PRECIOUS AND FIND IT FUNDS THANK OU. MS IMAN. THANK YOU I WANT TO ECHO -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO'S COMMENTS AT PARTICULARLY AS THEY DO HAVE A A CITY THAT IS ON THE LIST -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND CERTAINLY -- I WILL I SUPPORTED IT TO DATE I I AM WATCHING HOW THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS I DON'T WANT. TO PUT THE THE ALL ARE PUT COMMUNITIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET. I NEEDED A GOAL THAT WE I THINK ALL AGREE ON WE WE WE WE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED MORE HOUSING BUT I DON'T WANT TO PUT THOSE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING -- IN A POSITION WHERE SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDS WOULD HELP THEM. MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT THE CITY -- NEEDS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THE THE CHALLENGES THAT I'M HAVING IN TRYING TO THINK WE'LL THERE'S ALL THESE FUNDS ARE FINE AT AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM. TO BE PUT IN A POSITION WHERE NOW NOT ONLY CAN THEY NOT MEET AT THEIR HOUSING NEED OR ARE THEY STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR NEEDS BUT THEY'RE ALSO HAVING OTHER ISSUES AND OTHER -- AREAS THAT THE CITY NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY CITY SO -- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THAT CITIES AB ONE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THEY'VE BEEN. YOU KNOW THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY'RE ON THE LIST OR NOT BUT ALSO AB AND THAT. WE ARE GIVING THEM AT LEAST FIVE YEARS TO REACH THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT IF A CITY FOR WHATEVER REASON -- THAT FOUND THAT FIVE YEAR AT DIFFICULT THAT THERE COULD BE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT IT NOT ALL CITIES ARE THE SAME CITY I HAD IS A RURAL CITY -- EIGHT IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S SMALL -- AIDS IT'S JUST DIFFERENT AND SOME THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY DO -- IN SUBURBAN OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS SO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. MISS QUIRK SILVA. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I HAD WE HAVE -- DISCUSS THIS BILL AND THERE ARE SCENARIOS WITH THE BILL THAT I COMPLETELY SUPPORT BUT AS MEN NOTED SOME -- ISSUES WITH KIND OF THE CARROT AND THE STICK HERE BUT TODAY. ORANGE COUNTY RELEASED -- THEIR POINT IN TIME COUNTY EVEN THOUGH WE KNEW THAT THEY HAD TAKEN IT BEFORE AND THERE HAD BEEN OTHER COUNTS. WHERE SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS? AND AS SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE I'VE SAID THIS NUMEROUS TIMES IT IS JUST. UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE HAVE A COUNTIES AND CITIES -- THAT MANY TIMES HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT ARE CHOOSING NOT TO MOVE FORWARD WHETHER IT BE WITH -- PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHETHER IT BE -- THEY'RE JUST SAYING NO. AND IN ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO HAVE A FEDERAL JUDGE JUDGE DAVID CARTER WHO IS SAID NO THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. ON A RIVER BED FOR TWO YEARS AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOUR JOBS. THAT IS IT MELTED TOO MANY CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY MOVING FORWARD EMERGENCY HOUSING PLANS -- FUTURE SUPPORTIVE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND IT'S GETTING TO THE TABLE TO TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS BUT WE STILL HAVE CITIES -- THAT REFUSED TO DO THAT AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN LITIGATION SO AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO SAY YES YOU KNOW LET US HELP YOU -- I KNOW WHAT I JUST MET WITH THE THE DIRECTORS AND THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT YESTERDAY AND AND THEY'VE SHOWN ME THERE'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY'RE WILLING. TO ALMOST WALK PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROCESS WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS BILLS TODAY THAT HAVE SAID. YOU KNOW LET'S GET THE DATE ALL OF THESE THINGS BUT IN FIVE YEARS. AN ORANGE COUNTY WHICH IS THE COUNTY THAT I'M FROM IF YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH THE PLAN. AND YOU CAN'T -- THERE THERE'S COMMITTEE EVERY SO EXCUSE DOWN THE DAY ANY EXCUSE POSSIBLE SO. EVEN THOUGH THIS DOES SEEM PUNITIVE. AND I DO DEFINITELY BY THE TIME IT GETS FLOOR OR TO THE FLOOR -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PARTY WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE DEFINITION IN THE TYPES OF GRANTS -- MAYBE MOVING THAT FROM ALL TO A SPECIFIED TYPE I DO SUPPORT THIS TODAY -- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO STOP WITH THE EXCUSES WE HAVE TO STOP WITH ALL THE REASONS WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING. AND ELECTED MEMBERS ARE ELECTED TO MAKE CHOICES AND SO DO YOUR JOB. DO YOUR JOB HAVING A HOUSING PLAN AS PART OF A LOCAL A MUNICIPALITY I SET OUT ON US. COUNSEL FOR EIGHT YEARS THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE A LIKE DID TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN SO ELECTED OFFICIALS DO YOUR JOB OTHERWISE THERE'S THERE'S GOING TO BE -- REWARDS AND CONSEQUENCES SO I SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU [inaudible] YESTERDAY. THANK YOU MISTER THE GERMAN -- AYE AYES HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE OTHER -- THIS BILL -- IT IS A BLANK A BILL ACROSS THE STATE OR IS. AB -- A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GENERAL LAW CITY IN A CHARTER CITY. YEAH THANK YOU -- IT'S RELATE TO ALL CITIES THAT -- WITH OTHER GENERAL LAW WORK CHARTER CITY THEY STILL HAVE TO DO THAT THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT. AND OF COURSE THERE'S A WILL WELL PUBLICIZED CITY HEADS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WHICH IS WHICH IS YOUR CITY HUNTINGTON BEACH. AND I I WILL SAY THAT I KNOW YOU'RE CITIES WORKING ON THIS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOUR CITY IS GOING. TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE VERY SHORTLY OF THE NEARLY FIFTY CITIES THAT WERE ON THE LIST A FEW MONTHS AGO. FOURTEEN ARE ARE ON THEIR WAY OFF THE LIST THEY'RE WORKING TO GET THERE. AND CELL AND THERE'S OTHER CITIES LIKE YOUR CITY MISSED LAMONT FILLMORE WHO'S WHO'S GONNA BE WORKING ON THIS GET ANY MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO HELP CITIES SMALLER CITIES. FOCUS ON THEIR PLANET BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT HAVE THE ROBUST PLANNING STAFF LIKE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO LA SACRAMENTO HAPPY. SO IT WOULD APPLY TO TO EVERY CITY IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE THINK THERE'S AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR CITIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT ALSO SUPPORT TO HELP THEM DO THE RIGHT THING. THANK YOU AND IN A BOOK BUT HE SAID HOW TO THE BEACH IS THE BIGGEST CITY IN IN MY DISTRICT AND IT DID TAKE A LOT OF PUSHING. THE FROM FROM A FEDERAL JUDGE FROM A FROM SACRAMENTO WHEN LAST WEEK. OF THE CITY COUNCIL MILEY ACTUALLY APPROVE A A HOMELESS SHELTER IN HER THE BEACH AND IT. IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH -- JUST TO GET THAT ONE SHOWED HER APPROVING CONCEPT. AND I A A BECAUSE OF THE OF THE NATURE OF OF MY DISTRICT. I WENT TO LAY OFF FOR YOUR BILL TODAY AND I HOPE THAT WE WE GET TO A POINT WHERE I COULD SUPPORT A YOUR BILL ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS PAPER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE OFF THEIR I THINK MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE THE DYSON SAID HAVE EXPRESSED MOST OF WHAT I WAS HOPING TO EXPRESS TODAY AND JUST. WANTED TO ECHO THEIR COMMENTS I THINK THE CARROT AND STICK APPROACH IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A MEANINGFUL STICK IN THERE TO ENCOURAGE. CITIES TO IT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO HOW WE CRAFT THAT STICK TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF PRECISION SO THAT WE ARE. NOT HAVING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN WHAT WE'RE DOING SO PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS WILL. FOR ANY FINAL COMMENTS.
