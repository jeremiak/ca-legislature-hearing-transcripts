JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY WHICH IS OF PARAMOUNT CONCERN. TO ALL OF US BUT IS NOT SUBJECT OF TODAY'S HEARING -- DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF LEGAL CONFIDENTIALITY. OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING IS NOT ADVISABLE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND THIS FORUM AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR TREMENDOUS CONCERNS WITH ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THE BANKRUPTCY ON THE STATE. ON OUR RATE PAYERS AND PARTICULARLY ON FIRE VICTIMS WHO NEED RESOLUTION RESOLUTION.

AND ARE MOVING THE UTILITY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OF MISTER JOHNSON I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR FROM YOU TODAY AND CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOU WERE THINKING WHEN YOU TOOK THIS ASSIGNMENT -- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ALL NEED TO HEAR YOUR VISION OF THE UTILITY. HOW YOU'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE? SAFETY ON OUR GRID AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND A CLIMATE WITH GROWING THREATS. HOW YOU CONSTRUCT IN P. GENIES SAFETY CULTURE AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS? AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO LEAD THE UTILITIES TRANSITION ZERO CARBON. RESOURCES. YOU HAVE NO DOUBT HEARD MISTER JOHNSON THAT MANY OF US ARE A BIT CONCERNED. ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE THE RIGHT FIT FOR THIS UTILITY AT THIS TIME -- YOU HAVE UTILITY THAT IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF TO FEDERAL COURTS. OF WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS YOU HAVE A COMPLETELY NEW BOARD. AND ONE I MIGHT ADD THE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HELP THE LONG TERM INTERESTS. OF THE STATE IN THEIR FIELD OF VISION. ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN THE TRADITIONAL VERTICAL CONTROL UTILITY WORLD. YOU MUST HAVE QUICKLY GRASS BY NOW THAT ARE UTILITIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN STRUCTURE ND MISSION. SO IT'S A BIT HARD FOR SOME OF US TO SEE THAT YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON ALTHOUGH.

BUT YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONVINCE US OTHERWISE. HAS CO CO HOW DO YOU LEAD. CHOOSE ME SORRY DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING IT'S AN OPENING STATEMENT.

AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN YOUR LEADERSHIP IN YOUR TENURE -- I'D LIKE TO I WAS AT THIS POINT GOING TO TURN TO YOU -- TO HAVE YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS AT WHICH TIME I WILL TURN BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ALL FIRST AT THAT TIME TURN TO MISTER QUIRK DOCTOR QUIRK HAD TO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY AND OTHERS. TO HAVE AN OPENING STATEMENT AS WELL. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. AS YOU CAN PROBABLY ALREADY TELL I'M NOT A NATIVE. THE I SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS IN KNOXVILLE TENNESSEE RUNNING THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY. WHICH WAS THE FIRST ACT -- PRESENT ROOSEVELT AND THE NEW DEAL IN THE LAST REMAINING PART OF THE NEW DEAL. BEFORE THAT I SPENT NEARLY FOUR DECADES IN NORTH CAROLINA THE LAST FIVE OR SIX AS THE CEO OF THE UTILITY. AND I OWE YOU LIKE PGA ANY CALL PROGRESS ENERGY. I AM A SOUTHERNER AND SO IF I'M UNABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS WITHOUT AN OCCASIONAL Y'ALL. HELLO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE. SOME APPROACHING TWO WEEKS OF SERVICE AT P. GINNY I NOW HAVE ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE OF ALMOST EVERYTHING THE BUT I DO HAVE ABOUT ALMOST FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN AROUND THE UTILITY BUSINESS. AS A UTILITY LAWYER AND EXECUTIVE. AS FOR MY CURRENT BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTS OF THE UTILITY INDUSTRY HAS DRAWN THE TV A PARTICULARLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. BY THE SERVICE OPPORTUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES EVERY DAY. AND THAT'S REALLY WHY I JOIN THE UTILITY INDUSTRY MANY YEARS AGO AFTER A CAREER AS A LAWYER. UTILITY COMPANIES ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. THAT'S THE REASON WE EXIST THAT'S OUR PURPOSE. TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE THAT PEOPLE REALLY CAN'T DO WITHOUT -- AND THIS IS MY SECOND WEEK IN THIS CHAIR YOU MENTIONED THIS SINCE I STARTED ACTUALLY SINCE I FIRST TALKED WITH THE COMPANY ABOUT DOING THIS THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I'VE GOT NEWS. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS IT COMES IN VARIOUS FORMS ARE YOU NUTS WHAT DO YOU THINK IN -- BUT IT'S BEEN THE MOST COMMON QUESTION. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO LEAD A BANKRUPT CONVICTED? AND UNPOPULAR PJ. WHEN I COULD HAVE EASILY RETIRED I RETIRED TWICE ACTUALLY OF A MEDICARE CARD IN MY WALLET -- COULD RETIRED IN COMFORT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO PROVE THEM SORTED OUT HERE TO BURNISH BY BUSINESS RESUME. SO WHY TAKE ON ALL THIS TROUBLE. NEVER BEEN A BANKRUPTCY NEVER BEEN. ON PAROLE NEVER BEEN CONVICTED OF A MISDEMEANOR MY LAST TRAFFIC CITATION WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX SO. WHY DO THIS THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION UP FOR A LOT ABOUT AND THE ANSWER THAT IN SEEK THIS JOB. AND I'M NOT SHARP TOOK WE WANT THIS JOB. BUT THIS JOB HAS CALLED ME -- THEN REASON IS I CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS. I CARE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY I CARE ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON THE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF THE NATION. AT WHAT IT DOES FOR PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT P. JEANNIE AND I'LL TELL YOU. THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY CARES ABOUT PGA ANY OF WHAT HAS GONE ON HERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN ABOUT THIS. AN ESSENTIAL ROLE THAT UTILITIES PLAN CALIFORNIA CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS. I CARE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED OR HAD LOST IN THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS ELLEN. I REALLY CARE ABOUT DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND WE CAN GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT. ALSO CARE PERSONALLY PROFESSIONALLY ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS DEALING WITH. THAT I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING THE RIGHT ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS SO. I THINK GIVEN MY BACKGROUND MY EXPERIENCE AND THE FACT THAT I OWE NOTHING TO ANYBODY OTHER THAN TO DO THE RIGHT THING EVERY DAY -- I'M I CAN HELP WITH THESE CHALLENGES. HAVE PARTICULARLY THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES BEFORE PGN. THAT'S WHY I CAME TO P. JEANNIE THAT'S WHY I CAME TO SEE YOU TODAY. BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT I WANT TO HELP FIX. IT'S REALLY QUITE THAT SIMPLE. IT MIGHT HELPFUL FOR SPOKE INTO THE MIKE. SO AND APART FROM WHO I AM AND ABOUT ME THE OTHER BIG QUESTION IS. WORRIED ABOUT WILD FIRE SAFETY. I WANT TO ENSURE THAT IN TWO PARTS FIRST WHAT P. GINNY IS DOING AND THEN WHAT I'M DOING AS ITS CEO. SO VICE TO PROGRAM THE VISUAL A VISUALLY INSPECT EVERY INCH OF OUR EQUIPMENT IN THE HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS. LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STRUCTURES POLLS. ALL KINDS OF EQUIPMENT. BANNING LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES. AND I'VE BEEN PROVIDING UPDATES ON THIS TO THE CPU SAID OTHERS WE'VE INTENSIFIED OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT KNOWS AREAS. INCREASING THE CLEARANCES AROUND EQUIPMENT TARGETING PARTICULAR TREE SPECIES ARE MOST PROBLEMATIC AND FIRE SEASON. WE'VE EXPANDED PROCEDURES FOR TURNING UP THE POWER FOR SAFETY DURING WILDFIRE THREATS. AND INCREASING OUR CUSTOMER MITIGATION ACTIVITIES AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES SO THEY WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO REMAIN SAFE IN THOSE INSTANCES. HELLO TERRY THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT THINGS IS A VITALLY IMPORTANT. AND I BELIEVE SUBMIT SAYING IT'S COMING MAYBE NEXT WEEK THE HEAD OF OUR COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM WHO IS REALLY THE BRAINS BEHIND THIS OPERATION AND HE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE DETAIL. SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT BUT I DO KNOW THIS THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S TO ME OR I OR ANYBODY AT P. GINNY CAN SAY THAT'S GONNA MATTER ONE BIT. ANOTHER WE CAN SAY THAT MATTERS ONE BIT. UNLESS WE LIVE UP TO OUR WORDS AND OUR COMMITMENTS. CANNOT RESTORE TRUST. WITHOUT RESULTS YOU CAN'T RESTORE RELATIONSHIPS WITH RHETORIC. SO I DO KNOW THIS AFTER FORTY YEARS OF DOING THIS. WE CAN ONLY DO THAT WITH RESULTS WITH OUR PERFORMANCE AND THOSE RESULTS HAVE TO BE BASED ON FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT THINGS AND CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE RESULTS. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK I CAN HELP OF MY TIME THE TVA WE WERE CHIEF THE BEST SAFETY RECORD IN THE ENTIRE EIGHTY FIVE YEAR HISTORY OF THAT ENTITY. EVERY YEAR I WAS THERE WE WERE A TOP DECILE PERFORMING INDUSTRY AND SAFETY. ON THE SAFETY FRONT WE WILL BE BOLSTERED BY CHRIS HARD TO FORMER NTSB CHAIRMAN WHO IS. GOING TO BE A SPECIAL INDEPENDENT SAFETY ADVISER REPORTING TO ME. AND SO I WILL TELL YOU WE WILL BE LASER FOCUSED ON SAFETY. BUT I WON'T EXPECT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT UNTIL YOU SEE THE RESULTS. YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME FOR THE PEOPLE. THE CITIZENS THE CUSTOMERS HAVE TO BE BETTER. MISS PART OF THE REASON I HEAR THAT WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF NOT BEEN GOOD AND I THINK THE OUTCOMES HAVE TO START BY CHANGING THE FOCUS ON SAFETY. AND NOT JUST FOR SAFETY SAKE WHICH IS IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT ALMOST ANY INDUSTRY THE SAFEST ENTITIES ARE ALSO THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. YOU CAN DRAW A DIRECT COMPARISON TO SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES AND THEIR SAFETY RECORDS. AND SAFETY CULTURE. SIMPLY CAN'T BE IMPOSED FROM THE TOP DOWN I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING BY SAYING TOMORROW. OKAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE SAFE. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS A LINE? ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT THE RIGHT BEHAVIORS ARE RIGHT STANDARDS AND FOLLOWING THAT SAFETY CULTURES ABOUT ALIGNMENT AT THE PERSONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL. TO A SET OF BEHAVIORS AND BELIEFS AND THEN A COMMITMENT TO YOUR FELLOW WORKER. TO THE COMMUNITY TO THE CUSTOMER. MY CHALLENGES THE LEADER IS GOING TO BE TO INSTALL AND STILL THESE TRAITS. AND THIS COMMITMENT. THERE'S A PROBLEM WE NEED TO SOLVE [inaudible] AND I'M. PERSONALLY AWARE OF THE IMPACT OF THESE THINGS IN MY SHORT TIME HERE I'VE BEEN TO PARADISE TO SANTA ROSA AND SAN BRUNO. AND I DID NONE OF THAT IS A PUBLICITY STUNT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I DON'T DO PUBLICITY STUNTS. BUT I WANT TO GO SEE YOU KNOW YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT YOU CAN HEAR ABOUT IT TELL YOU THOUGH SHE YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS I MET WITH. VICTIMS WITH PEOPLE HAVE LOST FAMILY MEMBERS HOMES ELECTED OFFICIALS -- I WILL TELL YOU A SOMBER. SOBERING HEART WRENCHING EXPERIENCE FOR ME [inaudible] OF WHICH JUST FURTHER MY RESOLVE THE SAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO NOT LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON IS THE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE REASONS I JOIN THE INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR MY TIME A TV A WAS TO HELP CONSERVE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES -- I BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND I'M ON THE RECORD SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. I'VE READ SOME STORIES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THE TVA THAT ARE NOT QUITE FACTUALLY ACCURATE AND I'LL BE GLAD TO CLARIFY THAT RECORD -- RISE IT PROGRESS WE WERE THE FIRST COMPANY IN SOUTH BEACH TO START CLOSING COAL PLANTS. MY TIME A TV A WE WENT FROM 60% OF OUR ENERGY FOR FROM COLD A WILL OF REDUCED ITS CARBON FOOTPRINT BY 70%. WHICH IS REMARKABLE THING GIVEN WHERE THEY STARTED. AND I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HELPING BUILD A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS ANY OTHER REASON I CAME HERE. FOR SO THAT'S ME THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AND I'LL BE GLAD. TO IN MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU ARE BEFORE WE IS ME TURN TO THE MEMBERS LET ME JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- BRIAN DOLLY AND DR JIM WOOD OR A JOINING US TODAY THEY ALL WERE MEMBERS OF THE NINE OH ONE COMMISSION LAST WEEK -- LAST YEAR AND WERE THE CONFEREES FROM THE ASSEMBLY AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL SO THEY'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS ALONG WITH. OTHER MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE. OF DOCTOR QUIRK I THINK YOU HAD. I WANTED TO MAKE A FEW OPENING THIS IS AN OPENING STATEMENT WHICH YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T RESPOND -- TO SHOT BY THE WAY ALL SEVEN MEDICARE CARD OF ALSO RETIRED TWICE WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON ALSO MY SON -- WORKS DOWN SEVERAL LEVELS FROM YOU AND ENERGY ACQUISITION WHICH RIGHT NOW IS DE ACQUISITION -- BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF THE RETAIL. I LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT NOW AND THE PLIGHT OF THE RATE PAYERS DUE TO FAILURE STATE GOVERNMENT. HAD WE PREVENTED THE BANKRUPTCY WE WOULD NO LONGER WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY YOU INTEREST RATES FOR BONDS WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY 11% FOR EQUITY. AROUND THE RATHER THE RIGHT NUMBER. THAT'S WHAT P. JEANNIE AND IS SUGGESTED ALL RIGHT NUMBERS NINE OF TANNER TWELVE BUT I DO KNOW WHY IT'S BECAUSE THE MARKET HAS LOST FAITH. NOT ONLY IN P. JEANNIE BUT IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT. UP EITHER ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO PREVENT A BANKRUPTCY IS NOT ONLY P. JEANNIE AT THIS POINT. IT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IT'S SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC WHICH EVERYONE AGREES HAS HAD THE BEST -- FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM AND YET THESE TWO ARE BASICALLY JUST ONE STEP ABOVE JUNK BOND STATUS -- INTO WHY IT WENT INTO. P. JEANNIE WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY NOT BECAUSE AT THE TIME AT LEAST THEY HAD A HUGE AMOUNT TO PAY THAT HADN'T BEEN DECIDED YET WHAT AND IT STILL HASN'T BEEN DECIDED. WHAT FIRES WERE CAUSED BY P. JEANNIE BUT BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT THEY WOULD BE FOUND TO OF BECAUSE THE FIRES? AND THE FACT THAT THE STATE. THROUGH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WAS UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING [inaudible] OF PRESIDENT PEAVEY OF THE C. P. YOU SEE WHAT WE HAVE A TALKING BIRD I I REALLY DON'T ARE AYE INTO. NINE WE FAILED AND THE IMPACT IS COMING ON THE RATE PAYERS. IT'S COMING IN THE TYPES OF THE BONDS OF AND FURTHER WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE WALL STREET TYPES ON THE BOARD HAD WE STOP THE BANKRUPTCY [inaudible] THREE DOLLARS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE PART OF YOUR COMMITTEE I I MISS THIS COMMITTEE QUITE QUITE A BIT. SO -- WE'VE HEARD. IN THE PAST A LOT ABOUT -- TRUST ME AND YOU KNOW WE IT'S ON YOUR SHOULDERS. TO BUILD THAT TRUST BACK IN. THE RATE PAYERS AND PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT TO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY. SOME I THINK AND THE FAILINGS OF THE COMPANY I THINK MR QUIRK BRINGS UP THERE'S BEEN SOME FAILINGS ELSEWHERE SO -- I REPRESENT A BIG PART OF THE TERRITORY THAT PGD DELIVERS -- POWER TO MY CUSTOMERS ARE TO MY CONSTITUENTS -- COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN POWER WHEN WE HAVE. EVENTS WORDS HIGH WIND AND MEN WERE WE HAVE RISK. AND SO A LOT OF WE NEED SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE THAT ARE ARE. FEARFUL THAT IT DID NEED POWER OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MINIMIZE OUR WRISTS BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE I GUESS -- GOING INTO THE FUTURE AS FAR AS OUT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE MANY OF THEM ON LIFE'S THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM DIALYSIS DOM'S. MEDICALLY -- HE THOSE SAY WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I MEAN I I'VE HEARD SOME COMMERCIALS. THEY'VE BEEN OUT THERE TRYING TO START THE PROCESS AS PROCESS OF EDUCATING THE THERE'S LITERALLY -- YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T. WE NEED SOMEWHERE TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE. SO I'M NOT EVADING YOUR QUESTION I'LL GET TO IT IMMEDIATELY BUT I WANT TO SAY WHEN SUBMIT SAYING GETS HERE HE CAN GIVE YOU THIS TO YOU IN GREAT DETAIL SO IF YOU HAVE TIME WHEN HE COMES. TO BE INVITED BACK THAT WOULD BE GOOD BUT THE THIS IS THE IMPORTANT QUESTION. FIRST OF ALL WHY SHUT OFF THE POWER -- AND THIS IS A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES. IF YOU CAN'T KEEP IT SAFE FOR THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF THE SYSTEM HUMAN LIFE HAS TO BE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND SO THAT'S THE THINKING BEHIND THIS. WE WERE WELL PREPARED LAST YEAR. THAT WAS OBVIOUS WERE BETTER PREPARED THIS YEAR MUCH BETTER PREPARE. MUCH BETTER DIAGNOSTIC ABILITY -- AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE PERIODICITY WITH WHICH WE WILL DO THIS BUT WE HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME PREPARING FOR THIS -- AND WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL EMS SO THAT PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHERE TO GO. WE ARE. INTENT ON GIVING A LOT OF ADVANCE NOTICE. WE LIKE TO GIVE FORTY EIGHT HOURS IF WE CAN REPEATED AT TWENTY FOUR AND THEN IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE EVENT. WE ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SAY CAN WE SET UP A SHELTER IN THIS GYMNASIUM WERE IDENTIFYING. MEDICAL NEED PATIENCE SO I THINK WE'RE DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS HERE. THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE COORDINATION TO GO. BUT I THINK WE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. AND I THINK WE'RE DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE READY. SO LAST YEAR THEY ACTUALLY SHUT THE POWER OFF. BEFORE WE HAD -- THE EVENTS AND I KNOW. DOCTOR WOODS IN MY DISTRICT BUT WAS FORTY HE'S BEFORE CAME BACK ON SO NOBODY WAS EXPECTING WITH THE WIND OF IT WAS OVER. HE WAS GONE AND WAS FOUR DAYS LATER THAT FARMERS WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING. TO WHAT OTHER FIELDS I MEAN I WAS GETTING CALLS LIKE CRAZY. OF PEOPLE LIKE WHEN IS IT ACTUALLY COME BACK ON SO I GUESS FOR ME I WANT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE SAFE. AND I WANT TO AVOID THOSE RISKY TIMES BUT THOSE TIMES ARE SHORT WINDOWS THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY SHUT THE POWER DOWN. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA SS BECAUSE WHAT I I CALL ACTUALLY CALLED. P. JEANNIE MYSELF AND SAID ONE OF MY GONNA GET POWER BACK ON MY DISTRICT. AND HE SAID AS SOON AS WE SURVEY EVERY SINGLE LINE AS YOU JUST STATED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES OF LINES OUT THERE. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST AREAS THAT ARE SHUT DOWN BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A SYSTEM AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FOUR DAYS EVERY TIME THE AS THE NEXT OF IT PRETTY COULD BE EIGHT DAYS WITHOUT POWER. AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE EITHER IS WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE. TO SHUT THE POWER OFF DURING THOSE. EVENTS WHERE WE HAVE WE KNOW THERE'S A HIGH RISK AND THEN BE ABLE TO GET IT BACK ON IN A FASHION WHERE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY IMPACTED AS WELL THE SAME TIME SO. WHEN I HEARD THAT THE RESTORATION TIME WAS TWO AND A HALF TO FOUR DAYS -- I HAVE TO SAY MY I WAS MY JOB DROPPED -- BUT AND THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE BUT THIS IS A FACT THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WAS BUILT. TO REMAIN IN SERVICE. RIGHT THE FOCUS IS ALWAYS BAD AND HOW DO YOU KEEP IT WORKING NINETY NINE POINT 999% OF THE TIME. AND TURNING IT OFF IS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH YOU KNOW WE STARTED BACK IN WHEN THERE'S A FAILURE BUT SO THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS AND I WILL SAY THE THE PHYSICS. I DON'T GET TOO FAR TO PHYSICS BUT THE PHYSICS OF RE ENERGIZING A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM ARE NOT A SIMPLE DISTRICTS WHICH THERE ARE SOME COMPLEXITY TO THIS. NONE OF THAT GOES TO THE POINT OF FOUR DAYS IS RIDICULOUS HI KATHY. YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT I THINK WE'RE BETTER SHAPE. OVER TIME THERE ARE AS A QUICK MEANT YOU CAN INSTALL ON THE LINE THAT'S IN THE PLAN THAT MAKES THIS A LOT EASIER. I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THOSE DETAILS BUT WE WILL DO BETTER THIS YEAR. I AND I THINK IN I'M GONNA TURN DR -- TO YOU AS WELL BUT I WANTED TO JUST ALSO LET YOU KNOW IN THE COMMITTEE THAT WE WILL BE HEARING OF ANY HEARING NEXT WEEK. ON THE WALL FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND THEN THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES WILL BE HERE AS WELL. TO TALK ABOUT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION WHICH INCLUDES -- DINNER DISEASE. THAT WAS GOOD. SO WITH SO THE NO WAY BECAUSE PART MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE AROUND THAT VERY ISSUE OF GETTING IT BACK ON AND JUST -- AND I'M SURE I MEAN AND AND THANK YOU FOR GOING OUT AND VISITING SOME OF THE SITES BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DEAL WITH. IN ADDITION TO SAVING HUMAN LIFE IS ALSO THE LEVEL OF TRAUMA THAT PEOPLE HAVE LIVED THROUGH. AND THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY THAT THEY NOW EXPERIENCE -- CHILDREN OLDER PEOPLE YOU KNOW I MEAN FOR A PARTY TO TRY TO DO THEIR BUSINESS BUT THEN THE REAL THE REAL FEAR THAT EXIST AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DECIMATED. BY THESE FIRES A WHOLE SUPPORT SYSTEMS CANNOT YOU KNOW RIPPED APART. AND I THINK WE'LL SEE THAT. FOR YEARS TO COME THE IMPACT ON ON KIDS -- AS A LIVE THROUGH THIS -- SO I GUESS PARTY YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS AND AND WELCOME. WELCOME A IS YOUR OPENING STATEMENT WAS YOU KNOW YOU NEVER BEEN BANKRUPTCY YOU KNOW. SO WHAT PREPARE YOU TO COME TO A STATE A BIG STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S RAINING NOW WHICH MEANS TO US. THAT MEANS WILDFIRE SEASON IS GOING TO BE. EVEN EVEN WORSE -- BRINGS YOU TO STATE I CALIFORNIA WITH OUR HUGE -- ADD GOALS ABOUT RENEWABLES WITH TO THAT'S A HUGE JOB TO WORK ON EVERY URBAN TO BANKRUPTCY. I CUT WHICH YOUR PLANNER OR WHAT IN YOUR PAST HAVE DO YOU THINK PREPARES YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. AND I GUESS. NOW WE'VE ALL READ THINGS ABOUT. ABOUT YOU -- AND HOW LONG YOU PLAN ON STAYING. I'LL TAKE THE LAST PART LAST CALLED ABOUT THE SO I HAVE RUN BIG SYSTEMS I'M IN THE PJ SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. THE TV IS. EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. OF AND SO BIG SYSTEMS -- THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ME I AM A LAWYER I'VE. ACTUALLY VAN AROUND BANKRUPTCY AND I'VE ACTUALLY DONE SOME LEGAL WORK AS A YOUNG LAWYER AND I HATED IT SO I NEVER DID ANYMORE -- BUT BUT REALLY BANKRUPTCY IS A PROCESS IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED UNDERSTAND THIS IS A THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLICATED BANKRUPTCY IN AMERICAN HISTORY THIS -- ONE AND HERE'S THERE'S A WHOLE. ROAD SHOW SIDE INDUSTRY THAT GOES WITH BANKRUPTCY IT'S ALL THE SAME PEOPLE THEY SHOW UP SO. BUT I HAVE BEEN AROUND A LOT OF CATASTROPHE. I'VE DEALT WITH TORNADOES HURRICANES MAJOR EVENTS I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THAT. THE REGULATORY SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS UNLIKE ANY. ONE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. I GREW UP AS A REGULATORY LAWYER. AND TRIED MANY CASES INCLUDING CASES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND REGULATORY SCHEME SO. YEAH I HAVE A PRETTY BROAD EXPERIENCE OF REGULATORY LEGAL OPERATIONAL SAFETY [inaudible] FINANCIAL -- SO I THINK I COME ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN TO FIT IN THE BILL ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED THAT [inaudible] EDIT THAT. YOU THINK ABOUT WHO WOULD COME AND DO THIS. MINISTERS OVER A HIGH RISK. OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME PEOPLE. FOR A FIFTY YEAR OLD RISING STAR YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS JOB. I HAVE NO CAREER RISK. AT SEVEN AS PART OF IT FOR ME IT'S A IT REALLY DOES I MEANT WHEN I SAID THE REASON I CAME IS I THINK I CAN HELP AND SOMEBODY HAS TO HELP. SO I'M WILLING THAT'S PART OF SO I I I HAD THE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE BUT A GROWING EXPERIENCE OF SERVING ON AND STOCKTON CITY COUNCIL AND WE WENT THROUGH BANKRUPTCY. AND THAT WAS IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAINFUL EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED -- BUT BUT WE ARE NOW STOCKTON AS A CITY IS NOW ON THE RACE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO VERY STRATEGICALLY REBUILD FROM WHERE WE WERE. AND YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THE DECISIONS PEOPLE MADE AND HOW THEY LEAD TO THE CITY BEING IN A MUCH STRONGER POSITION NOW. WHEN YOU WE P. GINNY WHAT WE LOOK TO TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE? LEFT A BETTER THAN YOU FOUND. GREAT QUESTION. FIRST OF ALL NO MORE THESE BIG EVENTS. THAT'S GOT TO BE THE FIRST THING AND IF YOU LOOK AT I MEAN. LOOK AT THE HISTORY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF REPETITION OF EVENTS. THIS IS THE THIRD BANKRUPTCY INVOLVING P. JEANNIE ONE WAS A SUBSIDIARY BUT THIS IS NUMBER THREE I THINK THERE'S BEEN SIX IN THE ENTIRE UTILITY INDUSTRY OVER TIME SO. AND THEIR EVENT DRIVEN -- SO FIRST THING. WE HAVE TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT PROHIBITS BUT YOU CAN'T PROHIBIT BUT MINIMIZES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE EVENTS. AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH SAFETY CULTURE PAYING ATTENTION TO DETAIL RISK IDENTIFICATION RISK MITIGATION. ASSET PRIORITIZATION UNDERSTANDING YOUR BUSINESS SO FIRST THAT'S FIRST. LET US LEARN HOW TO RUN THE BUSINESS ABOUT HAVING THESE BIG RISK. TO LET THIS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF LIKE THIS TOO IF WE'VE LOST A RETAIN OUR POSITION AS THE LEADER OF THE CLEAN ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT I THINK THE BANKRUPTCY WILL AFFECT THAT A LITTLE BIT IN THE SHORT TERM. AND THREE SO I BELIEVE IN REDEMPTION. NOW WHAT SOME REDEMPTION FOR PGA ANY IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE CUSTOMERS AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING AND ELSEWHERE EARN REDEMPTION. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'D. I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN LEGACY. THANK YOU LITTLE HUBRIS INVOLVED WITH THE BUT I DO BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT AS YOU SAID OF LEAVING IT BETTER THAN IF. WE COULD DO THAT. HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE -- HOW LONG AM I WILLING TO DO THIS I GUESS IS A BETTER QUESTION -- YOUNG HEALTHY FIT. WILLING BUT AS LONG AS IT TAKES A FAKE. DO NOT INCOME HERE. WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS A SHORT THING [inaudible] NOW. BUT WE'LL SEE BUT I'D LIKE TO FIX IT. THAT'S IF YOU ACTUALLY TALK TO PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY ABOUT ME THERE WAS A YEAH HE'S WITH HIS THE FIX IT GOT SO. THERE'S A BIG FIX. IT IS IN THE WENDY. IT'S CRAZINESS CHAIR HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISS JOHNSON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MY NAME'S WHEN HE GOT THE I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE IN EAST LA. P. GENIE IS IS NOT IN MY AREA BUT I DID -- RECENTLY GO ON A VISIT TO PARADISE WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES. AND IT'S A QUITE DIFFERENT TO SEE IT FIRSTHAND THE DEVASTATION AND THE IMPACT HUMAN LIVES -- THAN TO JUST READ ABOUT IT IN THE NEWSPAPER OR SEE IT ON TELEVISION. AND THE IMPACT THAT THE QUALITY OF THEIR THAT WE ALL BREATHE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IMPACTS ALL OF US THESE WILDFIRES IMPACT RESIDENTS IN EAST LA JUST AS THEY DO RESIDENTS AND AND PARADISE AND AND THE AFFECTED AREAS. I THINK TRUST IS A WORD THAT OFTEN COMES UP IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FUTURE P. JEANNIE LOOKS LIKE. HOW DO WE ESTABLISH TRUST TO YOU AS A AS A LEADER OF THIS COMPANY NOW? HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE I'D LOVE TO HEAR LIKE MAYBE SOME OF YOUR PLANS IN THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS? AS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION SO YOU WILL TAKE TO CHANGE OR THE LEADERSHIP THAT YOU WILL HAVE WITHIN THE COMPANY. AND HOW YOU PLAN ON LETTING US KNOW IN THE LEGISLATURE. ABOUT YOUR PROGRESS OR SO CHALLENGES THAT YOU MAY BE FACING -- SO THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WORK TOWARDS PROTECTING CALIFORNIA PAIRS. AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS TRUST WITHIN THE PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION -- I MADE MY FIRST. TRIP TO CAPITOL HILL IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE INTO A STATE LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND I'M ONE OF THE ODD CEOS I THINK WHO. LIKES. THIS. I LIKE DEALING WITH THE MEDIA I LIKE DEALING IN THE POLITICAL SPACE IT'S NOT ALWAYS PLEASANT -- BUT IT ISN'T DEMOCRACY ON THE MARCH SO -- I'M HOPING TO SEE A LOT OF YOU PART OF THAT WILL BE ON YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SEE ME -- BUT I AM NO STRANGER TO THE PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND. THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN. UTILITY REGULATION THE LEGISLATURE. SO. I HOPE NOT TO BE A STRANGER THAT WOULD SAY THAT. ON THE ISSUE OF TRUST YOU KNOW. HOW DO YOU BUILD TRUST THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS YOU DO THIS THE FIRST THING IS SAY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND DO IT? RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S TELL THAT TO MY DAD HAD TO SAY WHICH I HAVE IT HERE TO JUST TELL THE TRUTH AS FAST AS YOU CAN. AND SO THAT'S PART OF TRUST TELL THE TRUTH -- IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS [inaudible] OWNER. DON'T COVERED UP. CONDUCT YOUR BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN BE PROUD OF AND WE'VE HAD SOME INSTANCES OF THINGS THE NOBODY CAN BE PROUD OF AND I THINK IT'S THAT SIMPLE METAL BUT THINK WE TEND OVER COMPLICATE THINGS THE THINGS LIKE TRUST. ARE YOU GOING TO DO SAID YOU GOTTA DO DID YOU MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU SAID IT DID YOU SOCIALIZE THE IDEA AND THEN DID YOU DO. SO IF I TELL YOU I'M GONNA DO THE BEST I CAN TO PREVENT A FIRE AGAIN YOU CAN COUNT ON IT BEING TRUE NOW WHETHER I WILL SUCCEED OR NOT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION. BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW WE REBUILD TRUST AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE -- WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THIS THIS IS ABOUT A SET OF BEHAVIORS -- A SET OF COMMITMENTS WE MAKE EVERY DAY HERE'S A WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BUSINESS. AND WE GET A LINE GOING TO FIX IT. THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF CHALLENGES -- I TELL YOU WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON FOCUSED IN THE SHORT TERM AT THE MALL. SO I'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON THE WILD SIDE FIRE SAFETY PLAN. AND YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME THERE ARE SO MANY ACRONYMS FLYING AROUND ON THIS THAT I'M NOT SURE I CAN KEEP ALL STRAIGHT. THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING -- PARTICULARLY THE INSPECTION AND REPAIR WORK. WHICH IS A TREMENDOUSLY LARGE TASK IN A VERY ROBUST PROCESS SO I'M THINKING ABOUT THE SHORT TERM AT THE MOMENT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE FIXED -- ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES HERE AND SEVERAL MAYORS UP TALK TO ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE IS HOOKING UP NEW CUSTOMERS -- AND TAKES WEEKS OR MONTHS THAT THOSE KIND OF THINGS OUT TO BE FIXED BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST. A WILDFIRE SAFETY AND THEN WE'LL GET TO EVERYTHING ELSE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. TO ME I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE ESPECIALLY SO EARLY IN TWO YEAR TENURE. SO I REPRESENT -- THE SANTA ROSA AREA. AND WHILE P. JEANNIE WAS NOT INTO IMPLICATED IN THAT PARTICULAR FIRE ELSEWHERE REPRESENT MENDOCINO COUNTY. AND BELIEVE SOME OF YOUR EQUIPMENT WAS INVOLVED IN THAT FOR OUR FIRES THERE. AS WELL AS OTHERS -- IN TWO THOUSAND AFTER TWO THOUSAND TEN THE SAN BRUNO PIPELINE EXPLOSION HELPED IDENTIFY SOME OF THE VICTIMS OF THAT. IDENTIFY THE VICTIMS AND MY FIRE'S. AND THEN IDENTIFIED VICTIMS AT PARADISE [inaudible] I'M TIRED. OF IDENTIFYING VICTIMS. BUT ALL OF THOSE. HAVE A LINK [inaudible] TO UTILITY. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AFTER THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN APPROACH. WOW IF OUR GAS LINES ARE LIKE THIS MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT HAPPENED. IF IT DID -- CERTAINLY WASN'T PUBLICIZED. SO AS WE GO IN TO YOUR TENURE AND AS YOU ARE INSPECTING. ALL OF THESE ALL OF THESE THOUSANDS OF MILES OF LINES THERE. WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING [inaudible] BECAUSE I THINK CAN WE COULD MISTER MISTER GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY IN TWO THOUSAND TEN TO REALLY DO THAT ON A BROADER BASIS. AND I JUST WANNA I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING. ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF UTILITY. WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY SORRY TO HAVE GIVEN YOU THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY BODIES AS A TERRIBLE. AND MARK MY EXPOSURE TO THOSE THREE PLACES THAT THAT IS JUST OF NOT. I'LL NEVER GET OVER SO JUST. AND I THINK YOUR ASSESSMENT IS CORRECT -- I THINK WHEN SAN BRUNO HAPPENED. ALL EVERYBODY WAS FOCUSED ON FIXING THAT. AND SO FIXED A SYMPTOM A BIG SYMPTOM BUT MAYBE IT AND FOCUS ON THE DISEASE. OF AND I THINK A LITTLE BEHIND ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE I THINK. THINK EMPIRICALLY YOU COULD DEMONSTRATE THIS -- ARE WE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING. WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING NOW AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A LEVEL OF GRANULARITY THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE IN THE INDUSTRY IS DONE MAYBE SAN DIEGO BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING AND WE WILL LOOK AT EVERYTHING. AND WE WILL LOOK AT THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS AT THE SAME TIME. SO THEY'LL BE NO DIMINUTION AN EFFORT IN THE GAS SIDE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GAS SIDE PERFORMANCE TODAY IS PRETTY GOOD. YOU KNOW THEY THEY GOT GOT IT RIGHT THERE DOING PRETTY WELL THEY HAVE OCCASIONAL HICK UPS THAT. KIND OF EMBARRASSING BUT BUT THE ELECTRIC SIDE WERE BEHIND WHERE THEY ARE. ON THE GAS SIDE AND WE'LL CATCH UP. MESSAGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. FOR COMING TO THIS COMMITTEE -- ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT THIS COMMITTEE. HAS BEEN DEALING WITH IS THE THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE CALIFORNIA -- ENERGY -- INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY WITH THE GROWING -- PROPORTION OF ENERGY BEING PROCURED BY -- COMMITTEE CHOICE AGGREGATORS. IT'S MUCH MY UNDERSTANDING THAT OF P. GENIES ELECTRICITY LOAD IS PROCURED BY. KIMI CHOICE AGGREGATORS AS RAY PAIRS ARE OPTING OUT OF PRIVATE ELECTRICITY SERVICE IN FAVOR OF THE LOCAL. LOCAL CONTROL PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND SO. MY FIRST QUESTION IS YOU KNOW AS WE'RE AS YOU STARTED OFF TALKING ABOUT SAFETY BEING YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND I THINK. YOU KNOW THE CONCERNS THAT THE THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. JUST EMPHASIZE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN. WOOD -- NARROWING P. GENIES SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION -- ALLOW PEAS YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. AND GREAT MANAGEMENT. SO I HAVE HEARD THE TERM COMMUNITY AGGREGATION. THAT'S ABOUT AS DEEP AS I GO BUT THERE WASN'T REALLY A QUESTION -- THERE ARE VERY LARGE COMPANIES IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS REGION IN THIS CITY. THERE ARE WELL MANAGED AND SO. I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF WOULD IT HELP. PGA ANY TO SHED SOME ASSETS -- RESPONSIBILITIES ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS -- I THINK. WE'LL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ALL THOSE THINGS. HISTORICALLY GENERATION TRANSMISSION. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY QUESTION. THAT -- WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON ALL THESE THINGS NOW I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE BEST ANSWER FINANCIALLY FOR CUSTOMERS IS ME MY RIGHT BEHIND SAFETY FOR ME IS CUSTOMER IMPACT? I AM PRO CONSUMER ALSO AND THAT. OFTEN HARD TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS BUT I AM BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STUDYING THINGS LIKE. DIVEST OF GENERATION OR MUNICIPAL LIES. BECAUSE WE CAN'T MANAGE OUR BUSINESS I THINK THE BETTER THING FOR US TO DO IS DEMONSTRATE TO WE CAN MANAGE THE BUSINESS. WELL AGAIN YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE. NEW TO CALIFORNIA BUT CCA'S IS A ACRONYM THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARING A LOT ABOUT. AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S NOT JUST -- TO NATO A HYPOTHETICAL BUT IT IS. YOU KNOW ALMOST HALF OF P. JEANNIE -- THE PC PROJECTED 80%. I BELIEVE -- IN THE NEAR FUTURE -- AND SO -- YEAH I A WAY WHICH IS TO I I BELIEVE THAT. THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF OUR FOCUSES ON WHETHER THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF UTILITIES -- HOW THAT WOULD -- INVOLVED WITH THE RISE OF THESE CCA'S. AND SO MAYBE I CAN COME BACK IN TWO WEEKS WHEN I'M TWO WEEKS SMARTER. QUESTION AS OF TODAY I CANNOT THANK YOU -- THIS RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WELCOME -- AYE AYE YEAH. I JOIN WITH THE CHAIRS COMMENTS -- ABOUT THE VERY DEEP CONCERN. ABOUT WHAT PGA ANY IS DOING IN RESPONSE. TO WHAT THEY CAUSED IN RESPONSE TO THE BANKRUPTCY. I DON'T AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT THE STATE'S ROLE AND LACK OF ACTION. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE FALL TEST GO SQUARELY ON PGA ANY. I ATE THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE SAID THAT -- HERE TODAY. YOU YOU YOU COMMENTED THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO CLEAN FOR THE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. THE PGA ANY [inaudible] YET. FOR TV A THEY ARE ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY TALK ABOUT. THE THE FACT THAT THE TRACK RECORD FALLS SHORT OF WHAT P. GENIES CUSTOMERS DESERVE. THERE'S A LACK OF SOLAR AND WIND POWER ON TVA'S COAL DEPENDENT SYSTEM. CALL MADE UP MORE THAN A QUARTER OF TVA'S PORTFOLIO LAST YEAR WITH SOLAR AND WIND ACCOUNTING FOR JUST 3%. ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE. THAT CONCERNS ME I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN COAL. DURING YOUR TENURE I RECOGNIZE THAT. BUT CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFERENT. THAN. THEN WHERE YOU CAME FROM. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. HAS QUITE A FEW HEDGE FUND -- MEMBERS AND TOO FEW CALIFORNIA MEMBERS. MY CALL BECAUSE ASKED ABOUT CCA'S. CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT AND IF WE HAD MORE BOARD MEMBERS WHO WERE. FROM CALIFORNIA ORDER STOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. THEN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. THE BOARD MEMBERS WOULD BE CONCERNED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR NEW CEO KNEW ALL ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT IN THE SHORT TEN YEARS SINCE YOU HAVE JUST BEEN APPOINTED WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO KNOW EVERYTHING. I GET IT. YOU ALSO SAID. THE YOU BELIEVE IN EARNED REDEMPTION FOR PGA ANY. ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WOULD BE. WHAT DID P. JENNY DO WRONG? THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT. AND THAT YOU WILL LEARN YOU WILL USE AS A LEARNING TOOL. DURING YOUR TENURE THAT'S COMING UP. IN RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE. YOU TALKED WE TALKED ABOUT TRUST. AND YOU SAID SAY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND DO IT. I I I WANT TO KNOW. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO? SO THAT WE CAN THEN COME BACK AND SAY WHETHER YOU DID IT OR NOT. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT I DON'T WANT MY COLLEAGUE TO GO IDENTIFY ANYMORE BODIES. I JOIN WITH HIM TO MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ON THIS CONFERENCE COME CONFERENCE. COMMITTEE ON THE WILDFIRES NIGHT LEARNED MORE THAN I EVER WANTED TO LEARN ABOUT THIS. IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT I EXPERIENCE IN MY COMMUNITY BUT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING PART OF THAT. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE RELIVING THIS WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE LESSONS LEARNED ARE SO MY QUESTION. IN ONE LAST COMMENT. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE GAS LINES I THINK MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ABOUT THAT [inaudible] AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD. THERE'S A COMMERCIAL OUT NOW. ABOUT. THE DOCTORS -- AND WHETHER THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD AND YOU COME IN AND THAT SERGEANT CERTAIN SURGEON COMES IN TO SEE YOU AND YOU'RE READY FOR SURGERY AND YOU LOOK UP YOU SAY. DOCTOR WHAT MY CHANCES YOU SAYS THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD I THINK. IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH NOT ON THE COMMERCIAL AND NOT HERE BECAUSE IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TO WORK ON POLICY THAT'S GOING TO PROTECT. THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE SERVED IN THIS CASE BY KEY G. ANY. SO MY QUESTION THEN IS JUST AS WE WERE DOWN SKATE PRESIDENT JUST AS WE WOULD ASK ANYONE ELSE COMING IN. TO SUCH AN IMPORTANT POSITION OF POWER. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS? I DO WANT TO HEAR. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND I RECOGNIZE THAT ONE ANSWER COULD BE? I'M GOING TO TALK TO PEOPLE FIND OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A HUNDRED DAYS TOO LATE. I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED DAYS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. BECAUSE IT WOULD THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT TO WIN UNLESS YOU CAME IN AND WITH THIS WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SHARED WITH US. AND THE WE'VE READ ABOUT. BUT WHAT IS IT THAT WILL HAPPEN NOW IN THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED DAYS THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. BECAUSE I FOR ONE WANT TO KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT YOU DID IT. WHEN WE COME BACK TO EVALUATE THANK YOU. PERHAPS I CAN START WITH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TV. I THINK HERE YOU PROBABLY EXPECT YOUR UTILITIES TO FOLLOW THE LAWS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE RULES OF THE CPUC. AND THE SAME IS TRUE TV ATV IS A CREDIT AS A CREATURE OF A FEDERAL STATUTE. PASSED IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND THE TV A ACCESS THE PRIMARY. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF TVA IS TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY AT THE LOWEST FEASIBLE RATE. THAT'S THAT IS THE EXACT LANGUAGE AND IS SUPPLEMENTED BY SAYING. WHEN YOU ADD RESOURCES YOU HAVE TO ADD THE LOWEST COST RESOURCE FOR YOU GET THE LOWER SYSTEM COST? AND SO THAT IS HOW THEY ENDED UP WITH THE SYSTEM THEY HAD WHICH WAS COLD DEPEND. NOW WHAT HAPPENED IN MY TENURE THERE AND A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THAT AS WE WERE TIRED A LOT OF THAT PLACE TO WITH SOME NUCLEAR SOME GAS. MORE HYDRO AND MORE RENEWAL. SO TODAY. TVA 60% NOT AMENDING HEADER G.. AND THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IS KIND AND HAPPENED TO BE 70% REDUCED IN FIVE YEARS. AND SO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS THE LOWEST COST OPTION. WAS ACTUALLY A I THINK A PRETTY GOOD BODY OF WORK BY THE PEOPLE THERE. THE POLICY HERE IS DIFFERENT THE POLICY HERE IS CLEANER AND GREENER. THE THE TV A TV A ACT COULDN'T BE CLEARER ABOUT WHAT. TVA WAS POSTED IT -- THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD. IS A STANDARD LINE OF MINE I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN. I'VE SEEN THE COMMERCIAL. BUT WHEN I EVALUATE PEOPLE INTERNALLY. PRETTY GOOD IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS I'M EVER GOING TO TELL HIM BECAUSE I DON'T WANT. TO GIVE TOO MUCH CREDIT -- SO BUT THAT'S SLIP ON MY PART. CELEBRITY ADDRESS THE GAS SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ITS TOP QUARTILE IN THE INDUSTRY IN MANY REGARDS INCLUDING IN THE SAFETY PIECE. SO THE GUESTS BUSINESS THE GAS SYSTEM HERE IS ROBUST WELL MANAGE THE RISKS ARE IDENTIFIED IN MITIGATED SO. IT'S WELL BEYOND PRETTY GOOD IT'S IT'S IT'S RIGHT UP THERE IN THE TOP QUARTILE OF GAS SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY SO. THE LESSONS LEARNED -- WILL PART OF THIS I DISCUSSED WITH HER COLLEAGUES YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE DISEASE NOT JUST THE SYMPTOMS. AND THE DISEASE. WAS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE ASSETS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IN SEPTEMBER -- HAPPEN IS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE CONDITION OF THE PIPE DIDN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT BEEN THERE ALL THAT SO THAT'S WHY IT HAPPENED SO. THE REAL LESSON LEARNED IS ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT'S THE LAST. WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE EVERYDAY FOR PROVIDING GAS ELECTRIC SERVICE AND OTHER THINGS TO PEOPLE IN A SAFE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE MATTER THAT IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND WHEN YOU STRAY FROM THAT. YOU HAVE EVENTS LIKE SAM ROAD -- WE GET DISTRACTED WE FOCUS ON I DON'T KNOW WHAT. BUT THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS BRING AN INTENSE FOCUS. BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OPERATING UTILITY SYSTEM. RIGHT CLEAR ROLES CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY CLEAR STANDARD OF WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE. AND I'VE ALREADY SEEN OUR NUMBER PLACES WHERE. WE'RE NOT EVEN PRETTY GOOD -- THAT WE LAGGED THE INDUSTRY IN SOME IMPORTANT. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS I'M GOING. TO USE INDUSTRY BENCHMARK TOP QUARTILE PERFORMANCES ARE MEASURE. SO EVERYTHING WE DO AN ELECTRIC GAS BUSINESSES MEASURE. AND PEOPLE KEEP TRACK OF THE INDUSTRY AND WE'RE GOING TO DRIVE TOWARD TOP QUARTILE PERFORMANCE AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE -- WE HAVE TO GET A LOT OF INTERNAL PROCESS SEES AND OTHER THINGS STRAIGHTENED OUT -- BUT TO ME THIS IS AN EXERCISE. IN RETURNING TO MASTERY OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE A VERY FUNDAMENTAL BUSINESS -- SO THAT'S LIKE THE FIRST YEAR. RIGHT. THOUSAND VISION LONG TERM -- CLEAN GREEN AFFORDABLE RELIABLE SAFE. AND A SERVICE PROVIDER THE CUSTOMERS CAN BE PROUD OF THAT'S IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GOOD PLACE TO BE AND A HARD PLACE FOR US TO GET. IT IN. THE PLANS AND I KNOW THERE'S A RESPONSE TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES YOU TALKED ABOUT ON THE WILD FIRE SAFETY PLAN. INSPECTION AND REPAIR BE VERY ROBUST. VISUALLY INSPECTING ALL EQUIPMENT WHICH WAS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT. HUNDRED THOU HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF A QUICK. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF EQUIPMENT. WHAT IS THE COST ESTIMATES? FOR THAT -- FOR THAT ACTIVITY THE RANGERS SIX HUNDRED THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION. YEAH AND I ASSUME THAT INCLUDES HIRING. MORE MORE STAFF MORE EMPLOYEES. YES WE HAVE. IN FACT ABOUT TAPPED OUT ON THE WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY TREE TRIMMERS INSPECTORS. WE HAVE EVERY RESOURCE WE CAN FIND AT WORK OUT THERE DOING THIS. AND WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM -- WELL. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- I THINK INITIALLY IT'S COMING OUT OF THE TV A COPPERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE IN RECOVERY OR ANY OTHERS TVA COFFERS. IN THE STOCK AROUND THE TV A COVERAGE THE PGA ANY COVERAGE I MAY HAVE SAID TV NAY BECAUSE IT DID AND I WAS I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THAT. THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY MONEY THERE SO. THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR YOUR HONEST ANSWERS A I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO COMING BACK -- TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE -- BUT AGAIN I DO WANT. TO STATE. THAT THE STATEMENT. GIVEN BY OUR CHAIR AT THE VERY BEGINNING. THE VERY HARSH. I THINK. EXPRESSES A SENTIMENT OF SO MANY. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND IN THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. AND HAVE LISTENED TO PGA ANY SET RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE. AND TALK TO US ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY COULD. SO I I TO WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY CHAIR [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WANTED TO BE STRAIGHT TALKER PAULA JESSICA CAME OFF AS HARSH -- BUT I THINK THAT -- NO WELL WE'RE FEELING AND SENSING AS A GREAT DEAL OF PRESSURE AND WEIGHT THAT'S ON ALL OF US AND NO THE UTILITY INDUSTRY IS VERY VITAL. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA VERY NECESSARY VERY IMPORTANT. WE WANTED TO WORK. ON BUT IN THIS LAST ROUND THE QUESTION I THINK THAT -- IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT. WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM AS WORD ALWAYS COMES FROM? AND IT WILL PROBABLY FALL ON THE REPAIRS MORE THAN LIKELY -- THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER CONFIGURATIONS OF HOW THAT ULTIMATELY TAKES FORM BUT I'VE YET TO HEAR A SEE HOW THE PIE GETS CUT. INTO MANY OTHER -- DIRECTIONS OTHER THAN HAVING REPAIR. CONTRIBUTIONS. SO DOLLARS. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVEN'T. TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS -- SO I'VE NEVER BEEN IN BANKRUPTCY BUT I'VE TRIED TO COLLECT MONEY FROM PEOPLE OR BANKRUPTCY IN AND BANKRUPTCY IS A TOOL BASICALLY. FOR THE COMPANY WHICH IN THIS CASE IS [inaudible] P. JEANNIE. TO NOT HAVE A JUDGE IS GOING TO MAKE UP THE DECEIT OR MAYBE MORE THAN ONE JUDGE IN THIS CASE I DON'T NOT SURE BUT A JUDGE IS GOING TO MAKE THE DECISION ON ALLOW YOU TO DO SOME THINGS -- AND THAT IT THAT MEANS CONTRACTS POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- THERE ARE A LOT OF A NEW WILL GOALS THAT REQUIRE -- POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH SOLAR AND WIND. HYDRO. GEO THERMAL [inaudible] BATTERY STORAGE [inaudible] AND SO. WOULD YOU TOUCH MAYBE ON WHAT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING WITH. AND THE JUDGE. AND THE OF MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE RELIANT ON THOSE PURCHASE POWER AGREEMENTS AND MANY COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT HAVE INVESTED. MILLIONS AND TENS OF MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA IN. TRYING -- TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE GREEN -- WHAT WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON HOW THOSE MANY OF THOSE -- ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES I KNOW THAT. TO MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT -- HAS THE GEO THERMAL WHICH ARE CONTRACTS WITH YOU WE HAVE HYDRO WE HAVE BIO MASS WE HAVE WIND WE HAVE SOLAR WE AND IT'S ALL THROUGH THE STATE. AND THOSE ARE ALL PURCHASE POWER AGREEMENTS THAT ARE -- AT RISK -- I BELIEVE IN IN A IN A OPPORTUNITY WERE A JUDGE AND A COMPANY CAN SAY HEY LOOK WE WERE PAYING I KNOW IN SOME OF THOSE EARLY CONTRACTS. FOR SOLAR WAS TWENTY TWO CENTS. FOR THIRTY YEARS AND NOW YOU CAN BUY SOLAR FOR ABOUT THREE CENTS AND SO. WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU SEE WHERE IT WORLD WORD YOU SAY THE COPY OBVIOUSLY YOU YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF SAVING THIS CAUGHT ME AT THE SAME TIME? RIGHT WHICH THAT IS PART OF YOUR ROLE AS THE AS THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY AS WELL SO COULD YOU MAYBE ADDRESS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON ON THOSE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EMPLOYEES AND PEOPLE THAT WORK. OF FOR THOSE -- ASSETS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE AS WELL. SO YOU START OUT BY DEFINING BANKRUPTCY. RIGHT WHICH IS A PROCESS TO GET ALL YOUR CLAIM TO ONE SPOT A ONE COURT WITH ONE JUDGE. FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN PAY AND THEN ALLOCATED THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BASIC PROCESS. AS PART OF THIS. CONTRACTS ARE REVIEWABLE. AND I AM NOT EVADING YOUR QUESTION OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS I'M NOT A AND WE THERE'S NO DECISION AND NO CLOSE TO A DECISION ON THE QUESTION ABOUT THE JUST WE KNOW IT'S OUT THERE. THERE IS A DISPUTE BETWEEN. THE C. P. WATER OF IS A DISPUTE THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHO'S ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF THIS QUESTION THE FOR THE CP YOU SEE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT -- I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. AND I DON'T YOU KNOW I'M. FOR BE IT FOR ME TO GET IN THE WAY OF YOUR TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT I THINK WE TRIED -- TO ESTABLISH AT THE ONSET THAT WE WERE NOT GOING. TO DRIFT INTO THE THE BANKRUPTCY ISSUES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND SO -- NO THAT'S OKAY -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT OUR OUR PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND THOSE ARE YET TO BE DETERMINED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOME WELL WITHOUT GETTING DEEPER INTO THIS -- I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE CONTRACTS SO I CAN THIS IS NOT A CASUAL. ISSUE FOR ME BUT WITH IS JUST THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THAT POINT YEAH [inaudible] THE TERM. DOCTOR WHAT. YEAH JUST JUST A QUESTION YOU SAID THAT I THINK WAS ASKED ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ASKED YOU KNOW WHAT IS THIS GOING TO COST TO DO. THE INSPECTIONS OF EVERYTHING -- WAS AT THAT WAS JUST THE THAT SIX HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED MILLION OF SUGGESTING JUST TO DO ALL THE INSPECTIONS. OR YOU TALK ABOUT REPAIRS AS WELL BECAUSE WE DON'T YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND NOW SO THAT IS THE INSPECTION AND REPAIRS BOTH -- AND THAT INCLUDES LIKE TREE TREMAYNE AND AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL OR IS THERE YET SO THERE ARE THERE ADDITIONAL LAYERS THAT THE WEATHER'S ALWAYS I'M SORRY I MEAN -- YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE SHOULD CALL THE TREE TRIMMING ITSELF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AND I THINK WE HAVE DOUBLE OUR EFFORT IN THAT REGARD STARTING IN LAST YEAR. THE SIXTY NINE HUNDRED HAS TO DO WITH THE NEW PROGRAMS WE PUT IN PLACE. AND THEY ARE INSPECTION AND REPAIR. AND THEY INVOLVE THE VISUAL BY A TRAINED OBSERVER BUT ALSO WERE USING DRONES. IT TURNS OUT THE DRONES CAN SEE A LOT BETTER THAN HUMANS CAN BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THE ANGLES -- AND THIS THE DRONE WORK AND THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF THE PICTURES. AND THEN WE HAVE. LARGER ROOMS OF TRAINED ENGINEERS AND OTHERS WHO CAN LOOK AT THESE PICTURES AND SAY. THERE'S A WASHER MISSING THERE THERE'S A COTTER PIN THAT'S BAND. SO IT'S BOTH INSPECTION AND REPAIR AND AND IT'S A VERY HIGH TECH KIND OF PROCESS THANKS. FOR THIS MAYOR. VICE CHAIR [inaudible] THANK YOU. SHOULD YOU COMING IN. AND TALKING WITH ASIDE. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS IN A VERY DIFFICULT. SPOT. AND THAT YOU ARE NEW -- BUT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY SOME. UNDERCURRENTS OF REAL CONCERN HERE -- AND I WOULD LIKE WITHOUT GETTING INTO ENOUGH AYE STRAIGHT INTO THE BANKRUPTCY AS PART OF THIS. HELP HELP ME OUT OF THAT. HOLE. I PART OF BUILDING TRUST I THINK IS TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING. OF THE ERA LEADERS. VISION AND IMAGINATION FOR WHAT PGA ANY IS GOING TO BE. I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN BE FAULTED FOR WHAT HAPPENED. YESTERDAY -- YOU HAVE A CHALLENGE TO REALLY GET WRAPPED AROUND TODAY WHAT'S GOING ON BUT IF YOU'RE HERE FOR A WHILE IT'S GOING TO BE THE TOMORROW THAT I THINK. ALL OF US ARE GOING TO WANT TO BE. ENCOURAGED THAT THERE WILL BE A A PGA ANY THAT IS IMAGINED AND ACTUALLY. SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AN IMPROVED PERHAPS THAN BEFORE WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE WHAT DO YOU ATTEMPTING TO TRY. TO DO AS THE PERSON AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID. TO REDESIGN AND PERHAPS MODERNIZE AND REIMAGINE WHAT. PGA ANY IS GONNA LOOK LIKE GO GO I MEAN WHAT WE'RE NINETEEN YEARS INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHERE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE PLANET. AND WE LITERALLY HAVE AN ELECTRICITY GRID. THAT I THINK IS SLOWLY DISINTEGRATING AND IT'S IT'S A LOT OF CONCERN FOR MANY OF US. WHAT DO YOU SEE THE ROLE AS P. GENIE IN THE BIG PICTURE AND WHAT IT IN IN CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY? SUPPLY. AND WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS THE IMAGINATION GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHAT IS THE NEW P. JEANNIE. LOOK LIKE WHETHER IT COMES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY AYE. THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER. BUT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR VISION YOUR IMAGINATION AND YOUR HEART FELT DESIRE. TO FIX. HELLO FIRST OF ALL -- WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT IS SURVIVAL MODE? TO BE FRANK ABOUT THIS RIGHT SO. BEFORE I CAN IMAGINE TOO HARD I GOTTA THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE AROUND TO BE IMAGINE RIGHT. I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK MAY I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF MICRO GIVE GRADES. MUCH MORE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION THIS. THE FIND A GOOD FOR P. GENIES BUSINESS MODEL AS WE KNOW IT TODAY BUT THIS IS REALITY OF CHANGE AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. I THINK THE TRANSMISSION BACKBONE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS SERVED US WELL. A IS ALSO ONE OF THE BIGGEST VULNERABILITIES WE HAVE. TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN LOCALIZE THINGS. WE ARE GOING TO SEE CONTINUED COST REDUCTIONS IN STORAGE WHEN YOU CAN COMBINED SOLAR WITH LOCAL STORAGE -- MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE SO I SEE A MUCH MORE DISPERSED WORLD -- MUCH MORE LOCALIZED. SOME CENTRALIZED YOU'RE STILL GOING TO NEED SOME SUPER HIGHWAYS IN THE SYSTEM. I THINK LESS AND LESS OF THAT OVER TIME IS WAS GONNA LOOK LIKE. IN THAT CONTEXT. HOW DO YOU SEE? ESSENTIALLY THIS DECENTRALIZATION AND LOCALIZATION. PLAY OUT WITH RESPECT TO RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY. WE SAY HERE. THAT PARAMOUNT IN OUR POLICY IS RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY FROM TIME TO TIME WE PRODUCE POLICIES THAT ACTUALLY. REDUCE RELIABILITY AND SPIKE. COSTS. I CONCUR WITH YOU THAT I THINK THIS -- DECENTRALIZATION AND AND THESE MICROGRAMS AYE HI I THINK THAT HAS SOME SOME REALITY THERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHALLENGES ARE FOR RELIABILITY AND FOR PORTABILITY IN THAT CONTEXT? THERE'S A REASON WE HAVE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY. BECAUSE IT WAS THE CHEAPEST WAY TO DO IT THE MOST ECONOMICAL AND RELIABLE WAY TO DO IT. WHEN WE BUILT A SYSTEM IT OPERATED OVER THE LAST? HUNDRED YEARS FIFTY YEARS CENTRALIZATION. ECONOMIES OF SCALE ALL THOSE THINGS WORK -- THEY WORKED MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE LIMITS OF TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT THE HOW DO YOU SEND -- ELECTRICITY OVER LONG DISTANCES WE HAD TO GO FROM DIRECT CURRENT ALTERNATING CURRENT THOSE KIND OF THING SO IT'S BEEN PRETTY STATIC FOR A LONG TIME. THE ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- IT OVER SOLAR PRICES ARE TODAY -- HE I THINK THIS WILL CHANGE I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK OF BEING ON THE FRONT EDGE OF THIS -- IT IS A FACT BUT IT'S A IT'S A FACT. TO THINK THE AVERAGE PGA ANY RATE IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO CENTS AVERAGE RATING TVA WAS NINE CENTS. NOW. ED DIFFERENT THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS AT ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENCES -- BUT PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE POLICY HERE. BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER PART OF THE POLICY GOING FORWARD AS IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE PLANET THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS TO GO MORE LOCAL MORE DECENTRALIZED. I THINK THAT'S WHERE WILL BE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS. APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I'D. WANT TO CONTINUE IT WITH YOU AND I THAT YOUR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES -- I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME REAL CHALLENGES LOOKING AT WHAT THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY GRAY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND I THINK WE'RE KINDA HELTER SKELTER RING IT. AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE FOCUSED ON A LONG TERM AS MUCH AS WE GET FOCUSED. ON THE FACT THAT. YOU'RE IN SURVIVAL MODE BUT I APPRECIATE AT LEAST THE EXPLANATION OF YOUR VISION THANKS -- I GUESS I HAVE THAT THE GAVEL AND WHO WANTED TO BE RECOGNIZED -- MEMORIES THANK YOU. I WAS JUST SENT OVER THE NEWEST HEADLINE PGA ANY CALLS CAMPFIRE. CAL FIRE SAYS. JUST CAME OUT TODAY PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY IS BEING BLAMED FOR SPARKING THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE. IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. A NEW HEADLINE. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE COST OF SIX HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED I KNOW THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT. ULTIMATELY WHERE DOES IT COME FROM. BUT THE THE ANSWER THE RESPONSE WAS CORRECT IT'S GOING TO ULTIMATELY COME FROM THE RATE PAYERS BUT MY QUESTION IS. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE THE COST SHOULD BE BORN. NOT ONLY BY THE RATE PAYERS. BUT ALSO BY THE SHAREHOLDERS. OF PGA ANY -- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE BANKRUPT. THAT'S REALLY WHAT WEAPON THE BANKRUPTCY HOW MUCH OF THIS IS PAID FOR BY WHOMEVER. AND PART OF THAT WILL BE THE SHAREHOLDERS. WE'RE TALKING PROSPECTIVELY -- RIGHT. THE RETROACTIVELY YES THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IS LOOKING AT THE PICTURE AND THEY WILL FIGURE OUT ALL OF THOSE COSTS AND FIGURE OUT HOW IT SCHOOL WHO'S GOING TO GET PAID WHAT AND WILL HAVE THE PROBLEMS JUST AS OF MY COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT. BUT PROSPECTIVELY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON THESE ITEMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE INSPECTION REPAIR. AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THE COMMENT WAS MADE THAT WHO WILL PAY. WILL YOU MENTION FOR THE P. JEANNIE COFFERS BUT IN THE JUST THE RATE PAYERS. MY QUESTION IS PROSPECT OF BILLY. WE'RE LOOKING AT SIX HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT WILL BE SPENT. TO RIGHT THE WRONGS THAT LET THE PRIOR RUNS. SHOULD IT ALL BE FROM THE RATE PAYERS. POCKETS OR SHOULD THE SHAREHOLDERS. ALSO PAY A PART OF THAT. I THINK IF IS WRITING PREVIOUS WRONGS SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD PAY THEIR SHARE. AND IN THE FUTURE. WHEN THESE EXPENSES ARE MADE? AND IT ALL FALLS ON THE RATE PAYERS. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT SHAREHOLDERS. SHOULD ALSO HAVE A SHARE. IN PAYING FOR THIS. YEAH IN THE INSTANT YOU HAVE DESCRIBED YES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. WAS CRITICAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP MORE OF MORE OF A COMMENT. TO GO BACK TO MY PREVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT -- YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE BACK AND FORTH CONVERSATION THAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED SEVERAL OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY. WE UNDERSTAND AND I UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY THAT WE MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO YOU. SO I HOPE THAT IN IN THE PROCESS OF HOW WE WORK TOGETHER. YOU TRUST THE FOLKS THAT YOU'VE HIRED TO TALK TO US DIRECTLY. TO COMMUNICATE. VERY CLEARLY AND VERY TRANSPARENTLY SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY AND THAT YOU TRUST YOUR TEAM THAT WORKS WITH US. ON YOUR SIDE TO BE ABLE TO CONVEY TO YOU THE SENTIMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE NEW DIRECTION FOR PGA ANY AS WAS DESCRIBED HERE TODAY THE NEW VISION. THAT YOU HAVE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE PROTECTING REPAIRS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. IN A VISION THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE WHILE I KNOW THAT THAT PATHWAY WILL BE CHALLENGING. WON'T BE EASY -- WE MAY OFTEN DISAGREE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT WE BUILD THE TRUST THAT WE NEED TO BUILD BOTH WITHIN YOUR COMPANY WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT I'M HOPING I AM. AVAILABLE AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME I WILL MAKE THAT A PRIORITY -- SO FAR THE PEOPLE IT. REPRESENTED HERE I THINK OF THAT A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING TO ME. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO THEM? AND IT'S BEEN VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SAID TO ME TODAY. AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT I WOULD HAVE. THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH SPOKEN TO BE BY THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH SO. AND IF I HEAR OTHERWISE WE'LL HAVE NEW PEOPLE WORKING THERE. THERE YOU GO. WELL LET ME JUST LET ME JUST SAY THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND YOUR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS BEHIND THE YOUR RESPONSES. AS I MENTIONED AT THE ONSET OF THIS -- HEARING IT IS -- IT IS A HEARING WHAT IT IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND WE HAD INDICATED THAT WE WOULD MAKE SOMETIME AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC. TO TO ADDRESS THIS -- MINUTE. TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I THINK THAT. ALL OF US CAN PROBABLY ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THAT AS TIME GOES ON WE'LL DO SO BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE FIELDED -- THE QUESTIONS TODAY -- THAT DEALT WITH A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT. ARE VERY MUCH ON THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND P. JEANNIE BUT JUST NOT. PGA ANY BUT ALSO HOW WE GO FORWARD TO STABILIZE THIS VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY AND AND CALIFORNIA -- AND BEFORE I TAKE. PUBLIC COMMENT I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL PROBABLY HEARING AND BECOMING MORE AWARE OF THAT -- THE CAMPFIRE RESPONSIBILITIES OF OF THE INITIATION OF THE FIRE DOES SEEM BASED ON OUR CAL FIRES ASSESSMENT -- TO FALL WITH P. JEANNIE -- MY FEELING IS THAT THE THAT THE THE P. GINNY AS SORT OF AN TO SUBPOENA THIS -- AND SO DOES REALLY CHANGE TOO MUCH OF THE THE DYNAMIC SO THEN NOW IT'S REAL WOOD AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT -- NEXT STEPS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A SECOND. TO RESPOND YOU DON'T HAVE -- TO BUT IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED. TO MAKE A STATEMENT AS IT RELATES TO THIS ARE CAL FIRE DETERMINATION. ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY SO. SO I HAVE MADE THE ASSUMPTION WHEN I GOT HERE THAT. P. GINNY EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THE FIRE JUST MADE THE ASSUMPTION BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO START. THE COMPANY HAD SAID IN ITS FILINGS RECENTLY IT WAS PROBABLE. THAT THEIR EQUIPMENT CAUSED THE FIRE SO. THIS IS A IT'S NOT A DISAPPOINTMENT. THAT. IS A DIFFERENT DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS HAPPENED -- LET'S NOT DO IT AGAIN. WE WILL NOW TAKE. PROBABLY IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION THE ONE OPPOSE IT OR JUST A COMMENT WILL GIVE YOU -- TWO MINUTES IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME. ON THAT NOTE OKAY. IT'S STILL TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU -- MICHAEL LOOK AT OR ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION I APPRECIATE LIKE ALL OF YOU THE FACT THAT P. GINNY CEO. WAS HERE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS SINCE FIRST TIME I CAN REMEMBER THAT FRANKLY SO. THAT'S A GOOD THING AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT CARING AND TRUST AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT TRUST AS IT TAKES YEARS TO BUILD. SECONDS TO BREAK AND FOREVER TO REPAIR. UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE FOREVER. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME P. GINNY HAS BROKEN THE TRUST IT'S NOT THE SECOND TIME. IT'S NOT THE THIRD TIME IT'S NOT EVEN THE FOURTH TIME. AND MY CONCERN IS IT WON'T BE THE LAST TIME. ONE OF THE THINGS I HEARD IT WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TODAY WAS THAT P. GENIES FAILURE IN SAN BRUNO WAS FROM A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I THINK THEY KNEW THEIR SYSTEM WAS PROBLEMATIC. I THINK IT WAS A LACK OF PRIORITY TO SPEND THE MONEY TO FIX THAT SYSTEM AND THAT'S THE INHERENT PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH PJ NAY. ITS PROFITS OVER SAFETY. JUDGE ALSO I THINK HAS. HONED IN ON THIS IS PART THE PROBATION DISCUSSION. HE'S TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY'VE PROVIDED FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DIVIDENDS OF THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THEY COULD HAVE GONE INTO SAFETY THEY DIDN'T WANT AND A SHAREHOLDER PROFITS. DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT I'M A FREE MARKET GUY REPRESENT A LOT OF FREE MARKET COMPANIES. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BALANCE THERE AND THAT BALANCE IS LACKING IN P. JEANNIE. WERE ALREADY SEEING IT EVEN MOVING FORWARD AND THIS GETS TO THE QUESTIONS I THINK THAT MISS RAMOS WAS WAS POSING AT THE AND WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. AND THAT ISSUE SHAREHOLDERS NEED TO OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKES. WE HEARD TODAY THAT P. GENIES. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAMPFIRE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT AND ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL BE. CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT TRANSMISSION LINE WAS PROBLEMATIC. IN THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON THOSE TRANSMISSION LINES FOR NOT ONE YEAR NOT TWO YEARS BUT MAY BE AS MANY AS FOUR OR FIVE YEARS. THAT'S ON THEM. THAT CAN'T COME BACK TO RATE PAYERS AND THAT'S THE FEAR THAT WE A LOT OF US HAD WITH NINE A ONE LAST YEAR. THAT HAS TO BE ON SHAREHOLDERS. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL THE BALL IN BANKRUPTCY RIGHT NOW P. G.'S PREOCCUPIED WITH RE ISSUING THEIR DIVIDENDS. THEY WANT TO START RE ISSUING PROFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS THE CENTERS A. EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY THERE'S GOING TO BE A PUSH TO RE ISSUE THAT DIVIDEND. THOSE DIVIDEND SHOULD GO TO PAY FOR ANY RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE FROM ALL OF THESE FIRES. BEFORE RATE PAYERS ARE ASKED TO PAY NOT AFTER. SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE HEARINGS THAT COME AFTER THIS TODAY FROM THE RATE PAYER CRYPSIS FOCUS ON THAT DIVIDEND. BECAUSE THAT'S MONEY IF YOU CAN GO TO SHAREHOLDERS. IT CAN GO TO PAY BACK THE DAMAGE THEY'VE DONE OVER TIME AND THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.
