ALL RIGHT LET'S BEGIN WITH FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO A SENATOR ALAN SB SEVEN FIVE TWO WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS IN A. WE WERE KNOWLEDGE IDENTITY DAY TODAY I KNOW WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT ON THE FLOOR. A LITTLE LATER TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF- AND THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH ME AND WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILLS SB SEVEN FIFTY TWO. THE TERM IMPROVES ELECTION TRANSPARENCY BY UPDATING AND CLARIFYING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON POLITICAL ADVERTISING. IN THE PETITION PROCESS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES- THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS POLITICAL TRANSFORM PARENTS THE REFORMS. ORIGINATING STARTING OUT WITH THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR POLITICAL REFORM ACT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MANY YOU MAY RECALL THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE DISCLOSE ACT WHICH BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PR IS CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS BY SETTING A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD. TO BE LISTED AS THE CAMPAIGN'S TOP FUNDER AND MODERNIZE THE CONTENT FORMATTED DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS ON POLITICAL ADVERTISING. AND THEN WE DID THE PETITION DISCLOSE ACT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO BRING THE SAME TRANSPARENCY MEASURES TO THE PETITION PROCESS. BY REQUIRING PETITION CAMPAIGNS TO DISCLOSE THEIR TOP THREE FUNDERS THAT WHEN. OUR FELLOW RESIDENTS WERE. INTERESTING TO GO GET SOME. YES SOME LETTUCE AT THE MARKET AND SOMEONE COMES UP TO THEM AND FOR US A- PETITION IN FRONT OF THEM AND SAYS THAT YOU KNOW SIGN HERE THIS WILL SAVE WESTERN CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT. ARE THEY YOU KNOW THEY AT LEAST HAVE SOME INFORMATION AS TO WHO IS FINDING. THIS EFFORT THE FUNNY THING OF COURSE IS THAT WE KNEW THAT A LOT OF THE SIGNATURE COLLECTORS THEMSELVES AFTER TIME DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO IS PAYING FOR THE CAMPAIGN THEY JUST KNEW THEY ARE GETTING PAID FIVE BUCKS A SIGNATURE. AND WE'RE ANXIOUS TO GET THE SIGNATURE. NOW SO WE GOT THE BUSINESS BECAUSE ACT ON A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH MADE IT SO THAT THAT- THAT THE GOOD FOLKS WERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DISCLOSING THE DONORS TO A CAMPAIGN TO THE INDIVIDUAL VOTER WHO WOULD BE SIGNING THESE PETITIONS BUT THE LAST FEW ELECTIONS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED TACTICS THAT OF COURSE HAVE BEEN USED TO AVOID TRANSPARENCY I USED TO SERVICE CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE I REALIZE IT'S A LOT OF OUR WORK IN SOME RESPECTS INVOLVES. COMING OUT WITH NEW TRANSPARENCY RULES AND THEN CONSTANTLY FIXING THEM AS AS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KEEP VOTERS IN THE DARK FIND LOOPHOLES AND THAT'S THE THAT'S ARE A LOT OF LIFE HERE MEMBERS. AND SO. THE CURRENT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS FOR POLITICAL TV ADS. UNDER THE DISCLOSURE I. CAN MAKE TAXED I'M CLEAR TO VIEWERS AND ONLINE ONLINE GRAPHIC ADS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DISPLAY ANY TOP CONTRIBUTORS. SOME PETITION SIGNATURE GATHERERS HAVE NOT BEEN SHOWING SIGNERS THE OFFICIAL TOP FUNDER SEAT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. SO POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES OF UTILIZED YOU LOOPHOLE TO HIDE THEIR TOP FUNDERS AND LOCAL LEGISLATIVE RACES WITH CONTRIBUTIONS JUST UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT WE SEE NUMBER FORTY NINE NINE NINE NINE. SO AS TO AVOID DISCLOSURE UNDER THE CURRENT DISCLOSE ACT THRESHOLD SO WE'VE GOT ALL THIS DISCLOSE ACT DISCLOSURE LEGISLATION WE FOUND A LOT OF LOOPHOLES WERE NOW TRYING TO TIGHTEN THEM UP. AND SO THIS BILL. DOES A COUPLE THINGSIT TURNED IT INTO CLARIFIES FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS ON POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS AND PETITIONS THE PEOPLE THAT WE CONTINUE TO. ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE. WITH THAT WE CAN REASONABLY SEE THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO THE TOP DONORS ARE THESE CAMPAIGNS OR PETITIONS COLLECTION DRIVES THE BILL ALSO TIGHTENS THE CONTRIBUTION LOOPHOLE BY LOWERING THE THRESHOLD. TO BE CONSIDERED A TOP CONTRIBUTOR TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LOCAL LEGISLATIVE AND BOARD OF EQUALIZATION RACES. AND I HAVE THIS MORNING AT TRENT LANG WHOSE PRESENT EXACTLY DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK U. S.

A BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS- SO GENERAL DESCRIBED OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN MAJORITIES IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA'S CLOSE ACT AND THE PETITION DISCLOSE ACT TO SHOW VOTERS THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION OF WHO FUNDS POLITICAL ADS AND MISSION OF CAMPAIGNS- BUT WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE PIECES THAT HE DESCRIBED. IT FOR ABUSES IN PARTICULAR THAT THIS BILL. ADDRESSES- ONE OF THE- KEY IS THE- ON TELEVISION ADS WE'VE SEEN OUR- THE NAMES I HAVE SUPER A LONGER COMMITTEE NAMES THAT TAKE UP THREE OR FOUR LINES OF TEXT SO YOU CAN'T GET DOWN TO SEE THE TOP THREE FUNDERS IN THAT LITTLE BLOCK AND THAT LITTLE BLACK BOX THAT THE DISCLOSE ACT REQUIRED ON TV ADS IN THE FIVE SECONDS THAT'S ALLOTTED SO SB SEVEN FIFTY TWO SAYS THERE HAS TO BE SOME SPACE. BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE NAME WHICH IS OFTENTIMES MISLEADING AND THE TOP FUNDERS ON THE BOTTOM AND MAKE THE TOP FUNDERS BE IN YELLOW VERSUS WHITE FOR THE COMMITTEE NAME SO THAT STANDS OUT AND POPS SO. A VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD- REALLY- MAKES IT EASIER FOR VOTERS TO SEE THE TOP. BOB. I JUST HEARD SOMETHING THERE BUT- OKAY- JUST I'LL GO ON- FOR ONLINE ADS- IT'S CLEAR FIVE THAT THE WE'VE SEEN- FUNDERS ARE NOT ARE COMPLETELY BE USING THE REQUIREMENT BILL THAT HE CLEARLY READABLE TO THE AVERAGE VIEWER I'M VERY HARD TO READ IN SOME OF THESE ADS SO PUTTING UP A SOLID BLACK BOX THE DISCLOSURE ON ONLINE ADS THAT CAN BE BRED. MR ALLEN SAID ON LARGE ONLINE THAT YOU HAVE TO SCHOOLS AT LEAST ONE TOP WONDER LIKE EVERY OTHER KIND OF THAT YOU ALREADY MENTIONED THE PROBLEM OF ALL THE FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLAR CONTRIBUTES TO A LOT OF LOCAL AND LEGISLATIVE- INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES FOR AGAINST CANDIDATES TO LOWERING THE THRESHOLD TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ADDRESSES THAT.

DO NOT SIGN UNLESS YOU SEE AN OFFICIAL PARTNERSHIP AND THE MONTH IS STILL VALID SO THAT SHOULD MAKE CLEAR TO EVERY SINGLE VOTER WHEN THEY SIGNED THAT THE NEED TO SEE THAT OFFICIAL POP UNDER SHEET BEFORE THEY SIGNED AND THEREFORE THAT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE UP VERY WISELY- REQUIRED THEM TO SHOW SO.

SENATORS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. AND NOT JUST IN THIS BILL BUT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO CHANNELS OF EFFECTIVELY FOR COMMUNICATION THAT ARE. AB SEVEN DRESSED IN THIS BILL WHAT ONE IS ELECTRONIC THE OTHERS IS PETITIONS- I'M INTERESTED IN PETITIONS TO SHOW. APPRECIATE THE IMPROVEMENTS JUST MAKES BUT WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON ENFORCEMENT- IN MY EXPERIENCE MY OBSERVATIONS. VERY HARD TO BRING EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT- TO ABUSES AT THE PETITION LEVEL PARTICULARLY. IN THAT SCENARIO THAT YOU DISCUSSED YOU KNOW THAT THE CLASSICS OF IN FRONT OF YOUR GROCERY STORE INTERACTION. YEAH SO HERE I AM ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO BEST ENSURE THAT THE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SHOWING THIS SHEET. WHICH THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOW AND- WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT GIVING. AT SO OBSERVE ONE OF THE IDEAS WAS TO HAVE SOME SORT CHECK BOX. WHERE YOU HAVE TO CHECK DID TO AFFIRM THAT YOU HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SHOWN. THE SHEET. AND IF THAT BOX WASN'T SIGNED AND THEN BECAUSE I THAT BOX WASN'T PICKED IN INITIAL THAN THAN THAT WOULD- THAT WOULD RENDER THE SIGNATURE INVALID ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WAS TO. REQUIRE EVERYBODY TO JUST PRINT THE TOP DONORS RIGHT THERE ON. THE FRONT OF THE PETITION FORM. AND TODAY IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE AND THEN THE OTHER POSSIBILITY WAS TO HAVE A LINE IN THERE SAYING. HERE DO NOT SIGN UNLESS YOU SEE. THE TOP DONOR FORM SUGGESTED TO PUT MORE INFORMATION. AND MORE. DISTRIBUTIVE FLOORING IN FRONT OF THE OF THE OF THIS OF THE SIGNATORIES- UNDER THE RADAR SCREEN SO AS TO REALLY GOING TO PUSH THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE THIS RIGHT THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE A LOOK. AT THESE TOP DONORS. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON- WITH THE COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INSURE THAT THE- THIS ISSUE IS ADDRESSED. THE ENFORCEMENT OF COURSE IS A REAL THING I MEAN I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ANYONE WHO VIOLATES THE CURRENT LAW AND SUBJECT TO. THE PENALTIES. UNDER THE FTP OF PPC BUT AS WE KNOW THIS IS A- KIND OF A- VERY HARD TO POLICE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OFTENTIMES VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE ENGAGING IN THIS PRACTICE. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WANTED TO COME FOR LEGISLATION THAT WASN'T JUST RELYING ON ENFORCEMENT BUT THAT ACTUALLY. INCREASE THE CHANCES OF NOT ABOUT NOT NEEDING ENFORCEMENT RATES IT'S OBSERVE MORE LANGUAGE RIGHT THERE ON THE DOCUMENTS THAT THE VOTERS SIGNING THAT. THAT THAT. WOULD WILL HOPEFULLY FOCUS VOTERS ATTENTION ON THE IDEA THAT THERE IS THIS. SHE AVAILABLE THERE IS THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT THEY THEY CAN THEY SHOULD. TAKE A LOOK AT IT WHEN THEY WHEN OUT BEFORE BEFORE MAKING A DECISION AS TO WHETHER THE SIGN. I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST THINK. IT'S YOU KNOW IT REMAINS. A REAL CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA- TO COMPEL EFFECTIVELY COMPEL SHOULD YOU GUYS PARTICULAR PROFESSIONALS PARTICULARS ARE INCENTIVIZED BY THE PERSECUTION BOUNTY. ALL RIGHT TO BE HONEST AND UPSTANDING AND YOU KNOW THERE'S VIRTUALLY I MEAN I STAND THE PANEL IS ALREADY IN PLACE AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS HERE- BUT IT'S IT IS SELDOM TO THE POINT OF BEING TO MINIMIZE THAT A. ANY ACTIONS ACTUALLY TAKEN AGAINST- UNETHICAL SIX AGO. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING AND WHAT YOU DO IN HEARING YOUR THOUGHTS REMOVED FOR THANK YOU MR. L. COMMENTS TO CENTER NIELSEN. KERN WROTE LET ME BE CLEAR HOW DOES THE- SENATORE THEN. WILL THERE BE A LIST OF QUESTIONS ON THE PETITION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SAY YES I WAS FULLY INFORMED- AND YES I KNOW AND THIS IS MY NAME AND HOW MUCH BURDEN ARE WE PUTTING ON THAT INDIVIDUAL SO IN DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMITTEE ULTIMATELY WHAT WE LANDED SO WHERE IT IS NOW AND I CERTAINLY WELCOME THE ENGAGEMENT OF THIS COMMITTEE ALL THE MEMBERS BUT WHERE IT WHERE WE LANDED IS THAT WE WOULD WE WERE SO INITIALLY THERE WAS THAT THAT CHECK BOX. A REQUIREMENT THAT THE CHAIR HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT- AND SO WE ALSO WE REPLACED IT WITH A DISCLAIMER IN EVERY SIGNATURE BOX THAT SAYS VERY CLEARLY IN CAPS DO NOT SIGN AND LESS. YOU HAVE SEEN OFFICIAL TOP FUNDER SEAT AND IT'S MONTH THE STILL ABOUT. SO THAT IT'S UP TO DATE SO THAT'S WHERE WE THAT'S WHERE THE BILL IS RIGHT NOW SO THERE'S ONLY ONE SINGLE PLACE THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO AFFIRM THAT THEY HAVE. THEY'VE BEEN RIGHT IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE SIGNATURE BOX HOPEFULLY THEY'LL READ IT THEY'LL SEE IF THEY'LL SAY HEY I HAVE THIS RIGHT TO SEE THE SHEEP BUT- YOU KNOW. WHAT WE WANT TO TELL ME A LITTLE MORE OF US THEN PUT IN A GOOD POSITION TO THE COMMITTEE THIS IS WHERE WE'VE WAITED BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO WORK WITH. ALL OF YOUR OFFICES TO TRY TO. WELL THE KEY IS NOT BEING PUT IN ON REASONABLE BURDEN ON THIS. ONE SIGN. THAT SAID FRANK THAT'S MY CONCERN RIGHT I THINK THAT WAS WHAT I THINK THAT WAS WHAT MOTIVATED THE CHAIRS- CONCERNS AS WELL AND- YOU KNOW WE GOT TO A PLACE WHERE. IT'S CLEAR. BRIGHT LINE. I'VE YOU KNOW. IT IT WILL BE HARD TO ANYONE WHO'S ACTUALLY READING WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING THE LEASE THAT THAT LITTLE PORTION OF THE AREA WHERE THEY'RE SIGNING- IT WOULD BE. IF IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO THEM THAT THEY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT AND THEY OUGHT TO LOOK AT THAT A THE FINDER SEE- BEFORE. A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THE SIGNATURE. WERE DURING THAT PART OF THE REQUIREMENT. HAVE TO BE IN ANY. PARTICULAR TYPE SIZE THAT PARTICULAR LANGUAGE- I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE SAME. TYPE SIZES THE OTHER. LANGUAGE IN THE- IN THAT BOX. THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE REQUIRING IS THAT THEY DO NOT SIGN IN LAST B. IN CAPS. VERY GOOD CENTER NIELSEN. MATT HI BEFORE THE QUESTION SURE- SENATOR. A QUICK PHOTO SO HOW DO WE PAY DO WE ACCOUNT FOR. POSSIBLE IN THE TICKING OF THE BOX ARE YOU IF YOU'RE NOT MANAGING A SIGNATURE. HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY ACCOUNT PARTICULARS THAT SIGNER WILL NEVER SEE THAT PETITION GOOD HOW HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT A BOX WHEN TECH WAS PICKED BY THE SOONER THAT IS THE SEVEN DAY THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT YOU CHECK A BOX ARE YOU INITIAL BOX IT SAYS RIGHT IN THE SIGNATURE BOX. DO NOT SIGN UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE FUNDERS OKAY SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SIGNED THAT PETITION YOUR IN A BOX WHERE IT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SEARCH THERE'S NOT ADDITIONAL STEPS NOW. THAT WASN'T CLEAR THAT THE INITIATIVE- CIRCULATORS AND CENTER ALLEN CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HAVE TWO OPTIONS NOW UNDER HIS LEGISLATION ONE IS THEY CAN PUT ON THE SIGNATURE SHEET ITSELF THE TOP FUNDERS AND MAKE SURE IT'S UPDATED EVERY MONTH THAT'S A NEW REQUIREMENT. EXCUSE ME THAT'S A REQUIREMENT THAT'S IN A LOT TODAY- BUT THAT THERE THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE THE ALTERNATIVE WAS TO HAVE IT ATTACHED- IF THE SIGNATURE PROPONENTS WANT TO STILL HAVE AN ATTACHED SHEET THEN THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY PUT IN THE SIGNATURE BOX THAT YOU SIGN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE THAT YOU USE IT YOU SHOULD BE MADE AWARE WHAT'S THE EXACT LANGUAGE SENATOR ALAN. DO NOT SIGN UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE OFFICIAL TOP HONORS UNITS MONTH THE STILL VALID SO THAT IS A NEW PROVISIONS UNDER THIS LEGISLATION IF THE IF THE PROPONENTS DECIDE TO HAVE THAT ATTACHED SHEET- WHICH IS WHERE THE CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED THAT UP THAT THAT WASN'T BEING SHOWN. AND ENDED CENTER NEWMAN AYE AYE I JUST I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR AS I DESCRIBED AS OUR REGIONAL BILL HOW. THE TICK BOX. I SOME OF OUR ARE STILL VERY THE TO BOX- I WE WOULD MAKE ANY CHANGES WITHOUT THE FULL CONSULTATION THE COMMITTEE ARE BUT I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE WHERE WE'RE COMFORTABLE NOW WITH WHAT THE COMMITTEES ACCESS TO DO WHICH WAS TO DROP THE TICK BOX REQUIREMENT AND JUST PUT IN THIS ONE REQUIREMENT WHERE IT SAYS DO NOT SIGN UNLESS YOU SEEN THE- THE SHE- AND THEN THAT WILL BE PLACED RIGHT INTO THE BOX. WHERE PEOPLE ARE SIGNING BE. THE PETITION- APPRECIATE SEGMENTED TO DISCERN USES POINT YOU KNOW IT DID WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS BURDENS OF WHAT IS WHAT IS TOO BURDENSOME. I THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE SOME- FRICTION OF THIS PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS ARE. PROPERLY ENGAGED IMPROPERLY AWARE DENNY QUITE OFTEN I THINK TODAY IT'S TOO EASY- TO SIGN PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW UNDER THE- KIND OF REPRESENTATIONS AND URGING OF PRECIOUS SIX YOU GOT IT LIKE HEY DON'T COST YOU ANYTHING PUSH ON. THEIR- AND SO BUT YOU KNOW I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THIS PROGRESSES VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT ANYTHING FURTHER AT CENTER ALLEN THAT FOR THE ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE ONE THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR THOUGHTFUL LEADERSHIP AT THE SPACE. I THINK THAT YOUR BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY REALLY HAS THE RIGHT. BALANCE OF A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS- AND I THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG WAYS TO- ENSURING THAT. THAT WE NEED TO SIGN UP. THAT YOU'RE MUCH MORE AWARE OF WHO'S PROVIDING THE FUNDING YEAH I THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT COULD WORK THAT YOU'RE ADVANCING THE PLOT. BUDGET CLOSE YEAH I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND I AND I NEEDED TO GO TO YOUR POINT CENTER NEWMAN AYE AYE. DURING THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE ACTUALLY I WENT TO THE MARKET AND I GOT CHI CHI STEP THROUGH THE MARKET VICE SIGNATURE COLLECTOR WHO WAS MAD AT ME. BECAUSE I WASN'T DOING HIM A FAVOR OF YOU KNOW EARNING IN THE EXTRA SIX DOLLARS BY SIGNING AN INITIATIVE THAT I KNEW ABOUT AND I DIDN'T SUPPORT. AND HE REALLY WAS OFFENDED THAT I WASN'T YOU KNOW TAKEN MY TO COUPLE A MINUTE OUT OF MY TIME TO GIVE A SIGNATURE. WHICH WOULD WHICH WOULD HAVE GOTTEN PAID. AND I NEVER FORGET THAT. ON THERE FOR HOW IT'S HE WAS. EVEN I DIDN'T I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. A ANY SUBSTANCE I JUST I WASN'T INTERESTED. IN SO I SO I THINK YOU TO THE CHAIR I CERTAINLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE WE ARE NOW- I THINK THIS WILL AT LEAST PUT AN ADDITIONAL. REMINDER IF THE- YOU KNOW IT DISCLOSURE TO THE TO THE VOTER THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY CAN AND SHOULD AND MUST. LOOK TO SEE WHO'S BEHIND THESE INITIATIVES BEFORE SIGNING. SO I THINK IT'S I THINK ULTIMATELY GETS TO A TO OUR CORE GOAL. AS A STATE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE MEMBERS- IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES I DON'T ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES. I AM WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT IS THERE A MOTION FOR THE COMMITTEE. WILL BY SENATOR NEWMAN. THE CONSOLE ONE CALL THE ROLL. PRESS B. SEVEN FIVE TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS GLAZER AYE GLAZER HI NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA RIVER BY NEWMAN AYE NEWMAN HI- SO THAT'S A THAT'S A THREE TO ONE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS CENTER ALLEN IF YOU HAVE THAT CATION TO. HAVE ANY FURTHER DAMAGE IN THIS BILL GOING FORWARD I WOULD BE HONORED TO BE LISTED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. FOR YOUR ATTENTION. ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA ON NOW TO. ITEM NUMBER THREE SB FOUR FIFTY NINE BY SENATOR ALAN WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE AGAIN. PLEASE PROCEED. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU LET ME START BY SAID ACCEPTING RETENTION LIMITS ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. SO MEMBERS THIS BILL GIVES THE PUBLIC THE PRESS AND LAWMAKERS MORE TIMELY AND USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE SPENT. TO INFLUENCE THE FLEET THE FATE OF LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU HERE IN OUR STATE. ARE LOBBYING FIRMS. AND THE INTEREST GROUPS THAT HIRE THEM. ARE REQUIRED TO FILE QUARTERLY REPORTS ON THEIR LOBBYING ACTIVITY ONE MONTH AFTER THE CLOSE OF EACH QUARTER SO THE THIRD QUARTER THE Q. THREE REPORT COVERS THE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE YEAR WHICH IS JULY THROUGH SEPTEMBER WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES THE- HE- INFAMOUS. FINAL WEEK OF SESSION. THE DURING THIS QUARTER MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENT TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION BUT THE DISCLOSURE FOR QUARTER THREE DOESN'T OCCUR UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY DECIDED WHICH BILLS ARE PASSED TO PASTOR TO FEET END. AFTER THE GOVERNOR HAS DECIDED WHICH BILLS TO SIGN OR VETO. SO HERE WE ARE YOU KNOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE LAST BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THAT PEOPLE HAVE WE SOME SEMBLANCE OF INFORMATION OF WHAT MONEY IS BEHIND. THESE CAMPAIGNS WHEN THEY ARE ASKED TO SIGN A PETITION FOR EXAMPLE OUTSIDE THE MARKET. I'M HERE WE OFTENTIMES HAVE NO IDEAS LEGISLATORS WERE VOTING ON A DIFFICULT CONTROVERSIAL BILLS AT THE END OF SESSION UNDER A VERY TIGHT TIME FRAME WE OFTENTIMES HAVE NO CLUE. WHAT KIND OF MONEY HOW MUCH MONEY AND CREWS BEING HIRED BY THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE SEEKING TO INFLUENCE. OUR VOTE. SO ARE SOLD TWO MILLION RIGHT NOW. A REPEAT OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASICALLY. GOOD FOR HISTORIANS NOT GOOD FOR WORK FOR US NOT GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC NOT GOOD FOR THE PRESS NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY. WHO WANTS TO ENSURE. THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE WISE DECISION MAKING PROCESS BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY. ARE THE DISCLOSURE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM PROVIDES. PROVIDES INFORMATION LONG AFTER THE FATE OF LEGISLATION IS DECIDED AS I SAY NOT ONLY AFTER THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF IS HAS DECIDED. ON ITS VOTES BUT AFTER. THE GOVERNOR'S. MADE HIS DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER TO SIGN OR VETO. SO NEARLY HALF THE STATES IN THE COUNTRY PROVIDE. OUR FOR REQUIRED MONTHLY REPORTING OR IN SOME INSTANCES EVEN MORE FREQUENT REPORTING CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THE POLICY MAKERS. THE PRESS THE PUBLIC HAVE MORE TIME WHEN YOU SAW INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOBBYING. THAT IMPACT PUBLIC POLICY SO THIS BILL TAKES A THREE PRONGED APPROACH TO INCREASE LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY. AND TO MODERNIZE THE REPORTING PROCESS FIRST OF ALL THE EXPEDITES THE ADVOCACY ACTIVITY. REPORTING FROM QUARTERLY TO MONTHLY FOR THE HIGHEST SPENDING LOBBYING FIRMS AND INTEREST GROUPS. REQUIRES THEM TO INDICATE THE SUPPORT OR OPPOSE POSITIONS THAT THEY TOOK. DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RATHER THAN SIMPLY LISTING THE BILL NUMBERS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES REPORTS OF SPENDING ON ISSUE ADS WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS THIS AND REQUIRES INTEREST GROUPS TO PUT THEIR NAMES. ON THEIR ADS FOLKS MAY REMEMBER- THERE'S MORE AND MORE THESE ADS POPPING UP ON FACEBOOK THEY'RE VERY TARGETED. AND OFTENTIMES THEY HAVE FAR FAR LESS DISCLOSURE THAN THE OTHER KINDS OF- ADVOCACY ACTIVITIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAST BILL. SO I HEAR WOULD BE TO TEST MY SUPPORT TODAY ARE JONATHAN MATTISE STEIN WHOSE EXECUTIVE COM CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE AND ALSO DOOR ROSE IS DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. DIRECT THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN SO WE WANT TO INVITE MR STEIN THIS ROSE TO- PROVIDE LEAD TESTIMONY THERE'S THREE MINUTES IN COMBINATION SO. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S ORGANIZED TO GO FIRST BUT PLEASE UP PROCEED. OPERATOR VEHICLE YOU'RE A MEMBERS GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. MY NAME IS JONATHAN NOT TO SIGN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR US BEFORE FIVE NINE. OUT WHICH I CENTER ALLEN MENTIONED AS THREE MAJOR THINGS AND WON MY- FIRST IT CREATES MORE TRANSPARENCY AND LOG AROUND LOBBYING IN SACRAMENTO PARTICULARLY FOR THE BIGGEST PLAYERS AND AT PEAK PERIODS. CALIFORNIA'S QUARTERLY LOBBYING REPORTING SCHEDULE STAND UNFLATTERING CONTRAST WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATE. REQUIREMENT THROUGH THE BOBBING REPORTING A MUCH GREATER TRANSPARENCY CRITICAL PERIODS AND ALLEGE THAT ACCOUNT. SB FOUR FIVE NINE AT CENTER ALLEN SUGGESTED. FOR FORM CALIFORNIA'S BOBBY DISCLOSURE RULES TO BE MORE. IN LINE WITH THOSE OTHER STATES. THANK SB FIVE NINE WOULD REQUIRE. BOB GROUP. WHO HAVE TO WITH EACH LOBBY ON. ALL DISCLOSED THE POSITION. ON EACH OF THOSE THAT. WE BELIEVE IS A COMMONSENSE CHANGE THAT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF THE SOLDIERS MORE USEFUL. THIRD SB FOUR FIVE NINE WOULD INCREASE DISCLOSURE TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING ON ISSUES THAT. THE US GOVERNMENT ANONYMOUS ATTACKS ON LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF. FOR THE AND FINALLY THE BILL WOULD MAKE SMALL CHANGES TO MAKE LOBBYING REPORTING EASIER AND MORE MODERNIZED. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE IS PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT GOOD GOVERNMENT COMMUNITY FOR THESE COMMON SENSE REFORMS THAT WILL GIVE THE PUBLIC A CRASS AND U. S. LAWMAKERS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT- SEEKING TO ENFORCE LAWS MADE IN OUR NAME. CALIFORNIANS I WAS A COMPLETELY THANK YOU JESUS FOR CHAIR AND HERE'S WE RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR I. ON SB FIVE. THANK YOU MR STEIN- THIS ROSE PLEASE PROCEED. THE MORNING CARE GLACIER MORNING MEMBERS DOOR RATHER STEADY DIRECTOR LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. SO FAR FROM NINE FUNCTIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT LEGAL TO BE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS KNOW NEW SPENDING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEING MADE AND THEN IT. AND THAT WE HAVE REALLY MEANINGFUL WAYS TO CHECK THE PUBLIC PROMISES SPECIALLY THE PROMISES OF LARGE CORPORATIONS. ACTUALLY MATCH THEIR LOBBYING ACTIVITIES TO THE ISSUE THAT'S COME UP A LOT RECENTLY ESPECIALLY IN THE- CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE- AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW LEGISLATORS TO LEARN INSIGHT INTO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND MAYBE LOBBYING BEHIND THE SCENES TO PROMOTER KILLED YOUR BILL.

WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER NIELSEN. MR MORE THAN JUST A GREAT CONCERN THAT IS SEPARATE BIG TIME HERE OF LATE. IS HE CAN AFFECT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE TEMERITY OR THE INTEGRITY TO SIGN PETITIONS TO BE SINGLED OUT AND SUBJECTED TO MADE VULNERABLE TO. UNDER PRESSURE AND I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND I'M GOING TO VOTE NO BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S A BIGGER DEAL THAN JUST THIS BILL BY FAR BUT THIS NOW BEING THREATENED AND OF IT BEING PROPOSED FORMALLY AWARE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THEN- SUBJECTED TO IN FACT ONE OF THE BILLS EVEN THEN ALLOWS THEM TO TURN THE LIST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO SIGNED OVER TO. POLITICAL COMPANIES KNEW FOR PAY. PUT OUT. THAT. THE I CAN'T I CAN'T GO FOR THAT TO STEP TOO FAR FOR ME AND EVEN THOUGH THIS MAY BE A SMALL STEP I CAN'T GO LONGER. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN SENTIMENT MISTER CHAIR IT WAS JUST A MOMENT. SIR IF YOU WOULD LIKE THAT I THINK I KNOW PERCENT AND ONCE YOU GO SORRY MR PLEASE RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE PROJECT WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH RESPECT ON MISTER VICE CHAIR AYE. I THINK YOU MAY BE TALKING ABOUT. CENTER NEWMAN'S. SIX SIXTY. EIGHT TALKING ABOUT THAT GENERAL IDEA NOT SPECIFICALLY HIS BILL BUT THAT GENERAL IDEA THAT I SEE SURFACING MORE OFTEN NOW. OKAY BUT THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SIGNATURE COLLECTIONS THERE'S THIS BILL IS PAST DUE WOULD LOBBYING DISCLOSURE. BUT IT DOES ALLOW FOR NAMING AND SHAMING. OUR ANALYSIS AND WELL AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY BUT LET'S GET LET'S PUT LET'S COMPLETE DECK THAT MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FIRST AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE SENATOR NEWMAN JUST AS BILL HARRISON RANKING THANK YOU MR SO I'VE JUST TO KNOW THAT THE BILL JERRY BEING REFERRED TO IN MANY CASES SB SIX SIX THREE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN. OUT OF DEFERENCE TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT AROSE AROUND PRIVACY RIGHTS SO THAT THE BILL'S A TO YOUR BILL RIGHT NOW SO NOT NOT RELEVANT TO HEAR BUT- DID SUPPORT I THINK TO NOTE THAT WE RESPECT THE CONCERNS AROUND PRIVACY BUT TO BE RUN INDIVIDUALS MY QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IN THIS CASE IS ABOUT THE PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO PURCHASE ADVERTISING- AND IT'S I GUESS IT'S MOSTLY MECHANICAL HOW WITH THOSE YOU KNOW PRESUMABLY SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE BEFORE DECIDING TO TAKE OUT ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT A PARTICULAR ISSUE HOW WOULD THEY LEARN ABOUT THESE REQUIREMENTS AND IF THEY WERE- EIGHT ZERO OUT OF COMPLIANCE HOW WOULD THAT THEN BE. COMMUNICATED AND ENFORCED TO THEM. IF TO B. C. CURRENT ENFORCEMENT- YOU KNOW THE WE HAVE TO BE SEIZE THE ALWAYS. I THINK THE ALL TREAT WHO ARE. FIRST TIMERS- WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE. A LITTLE BIT MORE SPACE. AND BUT YOU CAN YOU COULD MAKE THAT SAME ARGUMENT ABOUT ANY. ANY ANY ENTRANCE INTO THE POLITICAL SYSTEM RIGHT WHEN WE KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN  FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE- WE HAD TO LEARN THE RULES TO DIG THROUGH THE AGENT RUN AND- I THINK THAT'S TRUE BUT IT BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT RUN WITH THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC PROCESS TO GET ON THE BALLOT. THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO TAKE OUT ADS SO YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE GONNA NOT. RIGHT THERE SHOULD BE SOME EDUCATION COMPONENT- AND MAYBE THROUGH THOSE ENTITIES THAT ACCEPT THE ADS FOR POLITICAL MESSAGING. AB AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE AGGREGATE TOTAL YOU KNOW IF IT'S THOUSAND FACEBOOK THOUSAND YOUTUBE JOB SEARCHES AND SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT- YOU KNOW SO THAT. WE WILL WIND UP IN A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY WHO OTHERWISE THINK THAT THEY'RE ACTING HONORABLY UNSERVED LEGALLY. FINDS ITSELF ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THIS. IT'S GREAT POINTS AND I'M I CERTAIN. BUT TO ME TAKE A LITTLE DEEP DIVE IN AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT. THIS IS NOT ENFORCED IN A WAY THAT'S UNFAIR OR PUNITIVE OR OR AND. I THINK IT LOOK EVERYTHING YOU JUST EXPRESS IS NOT IN THIS ACCORD WITH MY GOALS HERE BRIGITTE THANK THANK YOU MISTER- SENATOR- ALLEN- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT REQUIRES A SPENDING EXCEEDING FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A CALENDAR QUARTER OF TWO REQUIRE REPORT IS THAT RIGHT YES. OKAY IT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN A MAJOR DONOR THRESHOLD THAT WE HAVE UNDER CURRENT LAW WHICH IS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE HAVE THAT OBLIGATION AS A MAJOR DONOR- I WANTED TO SAY I THINK THE DISCLOSURES ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO TO TRY TO. IMPROVE OUR OUR- POLITICAL PROCESS AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO TAKE THESE- THESE ISSUES UP PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO THE THIRD QUARTER- DISCLOSURE I THINK THAT'S A IN PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENT THAT I APPLIED AND- I THINK THAT- AS YOU HAVE SAID IN AT TESTIMONY ON A PREVIOUS BILL. AT THE THESE THAT THESE THINGS ARE WORKS IN PROGRESS AND AS WE EXAMINE HOW THEY ARE WORKING WE SEE WHERE THEY ARE WORKING WELL AND WHERE THEY ARE NOT AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT AND I THINK THIS BILL- IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH THAT PHILOSOPHY THAT I. I THINK IT'S A NECESSARY ONE AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR LEGISLATION TODAY DID YOU HAVE A FOLLOW. UP ON AGAIN THE CONCERN YOU KNOW SO WHAT A MAJOR DONOR TYPICALLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S MONEY THAT GOES FOR INSTANCE TO ME- THEN THERE'S A TO REPORTING FRAMEWORK BUT THERE IS NO SUCH WORK FRAMEWORK FOR SOMEBODY JUST DECIDES BE SPECIALLY VARIANT THE ONLINE TOOL TO DONE TO TAKE OUT ADS. ON FACEBOOK ON ON YOUTUBE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU COULD EASILY GET VERY FAR ALONG IN SPENDING THE AGGREGATE OVER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WITHOUT ANY CONTACT AT ALL WITHOUT WITH THE F. B. PC AND NO BASIS FOR EDUCATION SO YEAH GOD DID SPEAK TO YOUR POINT TO WORK IN PROGRESS WHICH IS SOMETHING I HINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. GREAT IT'S A GREAT POINT SENATOR HAVING COME UP BEFORE BUT BUT IT'S VERY WELL TAKEN AND- LET'S LET'S HAVE A CHAT YOUR ME MAYOR STUFF AS WELL AND COMMITTEE STAFF THAT. THIS FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS UNFAIRLY. THANK YEAH RIGHT SAN I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I WITH FIGURE A DISCUSSION I JUST I WANT TO SEE WITH WITH WITH- WITH SO MUCH RESPECT AND TO MY AND THE VICE CHAIR I JUST TO CLARIFY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING MY AND- BUT- THAT. BIT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT. I'M CREATING ANY NEW WOULD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THE IT JUST BASICALLY MAKES IT IT MAKES IT MAKES DIFFERENT THE DISCLOSURE COME SOONER RIGHT SO UNDER CURRENT LAW. EVERYBODY STILL EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO DISCLOSE INTO THIS AT LEAST WITH REGARDS TO THE LOBBYING ACTIVITY IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON. OUR WILL STILL HAVE TO DISCLOSE MAYBE THEY STILL HAVE TO DISCLOSE WILL ALWAYS GONNA HAPPEN IN THIS BILL IS IT'S GOING TO AXE IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SO THAT THEY CAN'T JUST DISCLOSE MONTHS AFTER THE FACT. SO AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IF YOU STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT SORT OF DISCLOSURE SCHEME IN GENERAL- IT DOES CREATE NEW REQUIREMENTS. WITH REGARDS TO THESE ISSUE ADS AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE HONEST I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN I MEAN I CERTAINLY PERSONALLY. I MEAN WE'VE ALL BEEN TARGETED WITH THESE ISSUE ADS THAT THEY- ARE SENT DIRECTLY TO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS AND IN OUR STAFFS AND- NOBODY ACK HOME SEEMS TO GET THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY TARGETED. ARE THERE CLEARLY BEING. TAKEN OUT TO INFLUENCE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS EXPLICITLY SO. AND YOU KNOW I JUST THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US AS AS CONSUMERS OF THIS INFORMATION TO HAVE SOME INFORMATION AND SOME SOME DISCLOSURE AS TO WHERE THESE MESSAGES ARE COMING FROM I'VE SOMETIMES BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN THIS I SOMETIMES I'LL GO DOWN INTERNET RABBIT HOLES TRYING TO DISCOVER WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT VERY EASY- AND YEAH THIS MONEY IS BEING SPENT TO INFLUENCE US INFLUENCE OUR DECISIONS AND IT'S BEING DONE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I. LIKE INDIA AND ADDS TAKEN ON THE NEWSPAPER. THAT'S AT LEAST ON DISPLAY FOR THE WHOLE GENERAL PUBLIC TO SEE THESE ARE ADS THAT ARE BEING TARGETED CHEST TO US AND JUST TO OUR STAFFS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO SEE AND YET IF THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING THERE BEING TAKEN OUT TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION OF A GROUND SWELL OF SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO A BILL. ON IT YOU AND- AND IT CAN BE VERY DECEPTIVE AND I JUST THINK THAT I THINK WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES AS INDEPENDENT DECISION MAKERS I WENT ALONG TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO JUST ENSURE THAT THE RULES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE CREATE MORE I TRANSPARENCY SO WE CAN KNOW WHO'S PAYING FOR THESE THINGS AND SIMILARLY WITH. REGARDS TO THE LOBBYING DISCLOSURE. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT. IN THE COUPLE OF THE OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AND AT AND I'VE I'VE PERSONALLY SEEN IT. AND I JUST THINK WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES AS WELL. AND THE PRESS DESERVES TO KNOW AS WELL- WHERE THIS MONEY IS BEING SPENT. AT A TIME WHEN IT'S MORE RELEVANT. WHAT YOU KNOW IT'S ALL VERY INTERESTING TO GO BACK AND SEE ALL THAT YOU KNOW THAT ALL THIS MONEY WAS SPENT. MONTHS AGO ONCE THE BILLS ALREADY SIGNED IT'S ALREADY BEEN VETOED- BUT BUT- BUT BUT BUT IT'S REALLY ULTIMATELY TOO LATE IT'S GOT IT'S INTERESTING FOR HISTORIAN BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT SO WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL NAY I DON'T THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS ENGAGEMENT IN THIS BILL THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN IS THERE A MOTION- MOVED. SENATOR NEWMAN.

ELECTIONS SO. I'M IT KNOW BASIC YOU FOR MAY WERE. BACK TO FIFTEEN THIS COMMIT. I HEARD IN L. TO PASS THE- VOTE. PARTICIPATION ACT WHICH BASICALLY FORCED THE ALIGNMENT. OF MANY MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WITH A STATEWIDE ELECTION SCHEDULED TO- IN THE ARGUMENTS OF THE TIME THIS IS GOING TO BE OUT INCREASING DOLLARS ACCESS PROMOTING TURNOUT LOCAL RACES. REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU STAND IN NASHVILLE. AND IT CREATED A SOME AMBIGUITIES- GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE THEN TURNED AROUND AND PASSED THE RECENT BILL I TO POSTPONE THE STATEWIDE PRIMARY FROM- FROM MARCH TO JUNE. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE DID THAT WHEN KOBE CAME IN AND IT THE LADY AT THE CENSUS DATA COLLECTION AND- THE MEDICAL OR SAID AS A RESULT OF DELAYED ARE REGISTERED IN TWO MISSIONS ABILITY TO DO ITS WORK. SO A LOT OF CITIES HI BASICALLY SET UP THEIR ELECTORAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE OLD MODEL BUT UNDER THE NEW UNDER THE NEW MODEL THAT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA MOTOR VOTER PARTICIPATION RIGHTS ACT TWENTY FIFTEEN. ALLY INTO APRIL AND MARCH THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE KICKED THE PRIMARY INTO JUNE. AND SO IT'S REALLY CREATED SOME TROUBLE- AND SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL AS IT PREVENTS. PROLONGED VACANCIES IT BASICALLY INSTEAD OF THE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL NOT LIVES LIVING A VACANCY BETWEEN BETWEEN MARCH AND JUNE. WE FILL THE GAP AND WE BASICALLY EXTEND THE TERMS FOR OFFICIALS THAT ARE SET TO EXPIRE IN EITHER MARCH OR APRIL TO ALIGN WITH THE POSTPONED. TWENTY TWENTY TWO STATEWIDE PRIMARY ELECTIONS SO THEN VOTERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THEIR MUNICIPAL STATEWIDE REPRESENTATIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY SO IT'S IT.

AS A RESULT OF THAT CHANGE BECAUSE WE CONSOLIDATED WITH THE STATE WE HAVE THREE COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SIT ON COUNCIL FOR THREE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE JUNE PRIMARY.

AND A COMMITTEE ELECTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL MEMBERS BACK TO ORDER WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR HERE IN THE ROOM- INVITA CENTER HERTZBERG TWO PERCENT- I TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX US BEFORE FOR THREE SENATOR HERTZBERG WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU WE CAN PROCEED IF YOU SEE FIT. FOUR FOUR SEVEN AGO THIS OF THE REFERENDUM. WITH YES YEAH OKAY THIS IS THIS IS A SENATOR- NEWMAN'S BILL HE WAS SO GRACIOUSLY TO. THEY GIVE IT TO ME. BUT THIS. SO THIS IS A HISTORIAN I AM VERY BRIEFLY. YOU KNOW WE DEVELOPED IN CALIFORNIA THE DECK A CENTURY AGO. REFORM MOVEMENT THAT CAME FROM A VERY CORRUPT SYSTEM WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WAS DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED BY THE RAILROADS THE REFERENDUM TO RECALL THE INITIATIVE WE SAID THAT LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE NOT GOOD BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE NONPARTISAN. AND WE HAVE TRIED OVER THE YEARS TO. MODERNIZE THESE VARIOUS- SYSTEMS THAT ARE INFORMED BY THE POWER OF THE ELECTORATE ON THE ONE HAND BUT THAT HAVE BEEN ABUSED TO SOME EXTENT BY. SOUTH SIDE INTERESTS AND ONE THAT'S PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME OF LATE IS THE REFERENDUM. GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE COME TOGETHER AND PASS A LAW BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE IT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO OVERTURN THAT LAW. AND TAKE IT FOR A FULL VOTE. WELL THE WAY THE LAW IS WRITTEN CREATES A- UNFAIR DISADVANTAGE THE PARTIES THERE'S TWO ELEMENTS TO IT ONE IS IT SAYS THAT IF IT'S A REFERENDUM IS A LAST ON THE BALLOT. THIS LAST YEAR THERE WAS A DROP OFF BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE BALLOT IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLOT BUT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. SECOND IT'S WILDLY CONFUSING BECAUSE GENERALLY A PROPONENT OF A MEASURE ONCE A YES. AND THE OPPONENT WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IN THE ISSUE OF A REFERENDUM IT'S EXACTLY OPPOSITE. THE PROPONENTS ONE I YES I MEAN THE OPPONENTS WANNA YES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THE LAW. AND SO WE HAVE S. C. A. ONE WHICH WILL COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AFTER THE INITIAL DEADLINES. AND THIS IS A COMPANION MEASURE THAT WAS BEING CARRIED. BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AND NOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA. AND BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO FOR YOU KNOW I WAS HE'S NOW IN A DIFFERENT JOB WE BROUGHT THAT BILL BACK TO THIS HOUSE IT WAS PART OF THAT PACKAGE I WAS KERN CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT HE WAS CARRYING THE STATUTORY FEES. AND CENTER NEWMAN HAS BEEN GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ALLOW US TO GIVE US HIS BILL. WHICH EVEN GOTTEN AMENDED TO BE ABLE TO PUT THOSE PROVISIONS SO. IT REALLY IS A WAY THAT IT AND THE SOLUTION IS NUMBER ONE THAT MEASURE BECAUSE THE WAY THE WAY THE COULD THE LAW CONSTITUTIONS WRITTEN IS THERE ORDERED YOU KNOW FIRST HIS INITIAL BONDS. THEN INITIATIVES BY THE LEGISLATURE PUT OFF THE OTHERS BUT PUT ON THE BALLOT AGAIN THE LAST IS. IS THE REFERENDUM THIS SAYS THAT REFERENDUMS ARE PUT ON THE BALLOT IN ORDER THAT THEY QUALIFY AND THEY'LL USUALLY NOW BE AT THE TOP BECAUSE- IF YOU'RE OVERTURNING IT THE LAW REQUIRES A REALLY QUICK. TURNAROUND IN TERMS OF GETTING YOUR SIGNATURES IN THE SECOND IT CLARIFIES THE YES VERSES YESTERDAY NO OVERSEAS NOW. I'LL TAKE THE AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THAT THAT WAS PRETTY SMART WHAT YOU GUYS DID MADE CLEAR IT EASIER I APPRECIATE THAT. AND SO IT'S REALLY A BIG ISSUE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WE SEE THIS NOW WITH PLASTICS SINGLE TOBACCO WE SING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHERE THE ABILITY OF INTEREST GROUPS TO OVERTURN THE POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE POWER OF THE GOVERNOR. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN THE POWER OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WITH THAT. I WOULD ASK YOU AND I BOTH AND I DON'T THINK I HAVE A W. WITNESSES YES YES I DID OKAY CENTER THANK.
