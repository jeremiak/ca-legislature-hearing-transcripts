NINTH CIRCUIT ANSWER PM COURT

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:48.485
PRECEDENT.

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:49.519
DUE TO TIME CONSIDERATIONS I'LL

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:50.553
ADDRESS JUST ONE MORE

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.655
CONSTITUTIONAL FACTOR HERE

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:52.589
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MORE THAT

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:53.156
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:54.658
RECOGNIZING THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:56.359
NATURE OF AB FORTY FOUR THAT IS

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:57.661
A GERMAN COMMERCE CLAUSE THE

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:58.628
JUDICIAL COMMITTEE THE JUDICIAL

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.063
COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:00.930
ARGUES THAT THE DORMANT COMMERCE

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.265
CLAUSE WOULD NOT BE IMPLICATED

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.299
BECAUSE THE LAW IS QUOTE

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:04.634
INDISCRIMINATE ON QUITE AS TO

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:06.536

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:08.471
MANUFACTURERS.

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:09.539
BUT THE ANALYSIS ALSO ADMITS

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:19.416
THAT QUOTE FEW IF ANY FOR FIRMS

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:20.550
ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:21.284
THAT'S LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:21.885
THE BILL SHOWS THAT THE BILL

00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:22.519
WILL HAVE AN INTENDED EFFECT ON

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:22.986
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:23.520
THIS MAKES AB FORTY FOUR

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:24.954
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS VIOLATIVE OF

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:25.555
A DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE THE

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:26.156

HOWEVER EIGHTY FORTY FOUR IS NOT

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:29.893
THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THIS

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.061

AND JUST BECAUSE WE CHOOSE FOR

HER WE SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:57.387
FOR THAT IT IS A LONG HISTORY OF

THE COMMUNITY.

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:01.124

WELFARE THAT EXPRESSED AN A. B.

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:17.974
FORTY FOUR BUT THE CURRENT

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.008
ORDINANCE IS FLAWED.

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.710
IT'S BASED ON DECADES OLD FAKE

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.512
STUDIES AND VIDEOS THAT HAVE NOW

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:24.247
BEEN PROVEN TO BE STAGED THERE

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.381
ARE CARVE OUTS FOR SOME FOR

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:27.550
GROUPS.

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:29.819
BUT WHAT'S LEFT IS ARBITRARY AND

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.387
PERHAPS LEGALLY INDEFENSIBLE.

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:32.822
WE TO WANT TO KEEP BAD PLAYERS

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.324
ON THE MARKET.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.859
BUT THE BAND IS NOT THE ANSWER A

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:38.128
BAND SIMPLY SENDS CONSUMERS OUT

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:39.462
OF CALIFORNIA TO PURCHASE FOR

00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:41.231

REVENUES.

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:43.333
AND IN THE END THE BAND HAS

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:44.667
ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT ON ANIMAL

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:47.170
WELFARE BUT WHAT A BAND DOES DO

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.471
IS IT TAKES AWAY THE CONSUMERS

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:50.206
RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO PURCHASE

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.508

THERE'S A LITTLE CULTURAL

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.150
CONNECTION TO THIS ISSUE --

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:23.953
TRIVIALIZES THE POINT.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.723
OF AND IT.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.125
FOCUSES ON A DIVISIVE.

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:33.363
OF ISSUE THAT IS.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:35.298
NOT ACCEPTED BY ME.

I KNOW.

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:49.379

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:51.881
OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT YOU COULD

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.750
HAVE MADE.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.785
BUT TO CHOOSE -- TO MAKE IT IN

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:56.386
THE WAY THAT YOU MADE I THINK

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.788
WAS NOT HELPFUL TO YOUR CAUSE.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:01.024

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:57.413
OBJECTIONS WHEN THE BILL WAS

ACTUALLY VERY SYMPATHETIC TO

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:18.334
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:19.602
UP.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:20.136
YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE A

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:20.803
COUPLE OF FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS THAT

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:21.871
OUR INTENTION ON TE ONE HAND WE

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:24.107
ALL WANT -- TO ADVOCATE FOR

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.408
HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.743
ON THE OTHER HAND FOR THOUSANDS

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.312
AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HUMANS

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:30.046
HAVE KILLED ANIMALS FOR THEIR

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:30.780
FLESH.

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.448
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.850
ADVOCATING HERE THAT WE

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.118
COMPLETELY ABANDON THE PRACTICE

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:36.419
OF USING AN ANIMAL PRODUCTS FOR

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.820
ANYTHING.

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:38.421
SO WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:39.422
NEEDLE.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.824
IN -- AS WE DO WITH THE

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:44.160
CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL FLESH

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.662
WHERE WE HAVE REGULATIONS FOR

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.698
HUMANE WAYS TO REAR THESE

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:50.032
ANIMALS AND TO SLAUGHTER THEM --

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.868
AND I'M WONDERING WHY YOU DIDN'T

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:52.969
TAKE THAT APPROACH WITH THIS

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.103
BILL BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:55.838
INTRODUCED REGULATIONS ON THE

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.140
FOR INDUSTRY ABOUT HOW THE

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:58.107
ANIMALS WERE RAISED AND

01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:59.442
SLAUGHTERED AS WE DO.

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.110
IN OTHER PARTS OF ANIMAL

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.613
HUSBANDRY INSTEAD OF JUST AN

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:04.280
OUTRIGHT BAN.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:05.448
THANK YOU AND THAT IS A GOOD

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.683
QUESTION -- A LOT OF THE FOR

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.018
THAT USED INCLUDING COMES FROM

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.019
COUNTRIES WHERE IT WOULD BE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:11.654
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO TRACK AND

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.455
REGULATE.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.357
AND WE HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:15.658
TRACKING IN REGULATING.

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.994
I'M THE ITEMS THAT ARE CLEARLY A

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.563
PUBLIC -- HELD A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.265
DANGER THINGS LIKE.

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:24.333
LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHILDREN'S

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.637
TOYS -- AND SO WE SIMPLY DON'T

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:30.239
HAVE THE MANPOWER OR THE STAFF

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.241
TO TRY TO REGULATE ITEMS THAT

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.443
ARE MADE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:35.811
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:36.612
A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS COME

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:38.114
FROM ASIA COME FROM EASTERN

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.316
EUROPE PLACES THAT YOU KNOW

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:42.451
OFTENTIMES DON'T HAVE -- THE

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:43.619
KIND OF NETWORK THAT WOULD GIVE

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.888
US ANY SORT OF COMFORT ABOUT THE

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.023
WAY THAT ON THE ANIMALS BEING

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.424
RAISED BUT ALSO ONE OTHER THING

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.692
WE TALKING ABOUT WILD ANIMALS

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.427
THAT ARE USED IN THESE THIS FOR

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:51.994
PRODUCTS.

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:53.596
THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT BY NATURE

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.264
THEY'RE NOT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.133
IT'S MY CONTENTION THAT THE WAY

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.034
THAT THEY ARE RAISED IN

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.468
CAPTIVITY IS BY NATURE CRUEL

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:00.536
BECAUSE THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.405
WANT TO ROME THAT WANT TO HUNT

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:03.673
THERE IT'S NOT A COW.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:06.008
THAT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY HAPPY

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.443
HANGING OUT EATING GRASS ALL DAY.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.879
COM THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT BY

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:12.315
BEING CONFINED -- THE DUES DOES

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:13.749
LEAD TO HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS I

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.818
MEAN ZOOS GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.987
KEEP THEIR ANIMALS FOR FILLED

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:20.056
JUST BECAUSE EVEN LIMITING THEIR

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:21.557
ROAMING TO THE SMALL AMOUNT OF

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:22.959
SPACE THAT THEY HAVE AN IS DUE --

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.560
IS PROBLEMATIC SOMETIMES FOR

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:25.695
SOME OF THE SPECIES SO THESE ARE

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:27.463
ANIMALS THAT I I DON'T THINK

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.265
THERE IS A WAY OF RAISING A LOT

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:31.200
OF THESE ANIMALS OF FOX OR MAKE

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:33.869
THAT IS -- THAT'S NOT COOL TO

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.504
THE ANIMAL AND THEN WITH BECAUSE

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.772
THEY'RE NOT FOOD ANIMALS THE

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.475
SLAUGHTERS NOT REGULATED -- SO I

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.644
JUST THINK THAT -- I BELIEVE

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:44.547
THAT IF CONSUMERS UNDERSTOOD --

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:45.881
THE SUFFERING THAT WENT INTO THE

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.883
GARMENTS THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.685
TO WEAR THEM AND I DO THINK THAT

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:50.853
THIS IS AN EXPRESSION OF OF

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.222
CALIFORNIA VALUES -- AND I THINK

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:54.624
THAT FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.325
STAND AND SAY WE WANT TO MAKE

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:57.860
SURE THAT PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:04.734
IN OUR STATE ARE NOT DONE -- ON

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.968
THE WITH THE SUFFERING OF

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:06.602
ANIMALS THAT OF OF BEINGS THAT

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:07.236
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES OR

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:07.870
DEFEND THEMSELVES IS VERY MUCH

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.138
IN KEEPING WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.073
EXPECTS [inaudible]

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:14.010
RIGHT BUT I I UNDERSTAND -- THIS

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.211
LET ME POINT OUT THOUGH THAT IN

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.212
OTHER INDUSTRIES.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:19.048
WHERE THE BURDEN OF REGULATING A

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:20.483
PRODUCT OF THE THE PRODUCTION OF

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:21.917
A PRODUCT WOULD BE TOO GREAT?

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:23.286
WE RELY ON CERTIFICATION

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.588
STANDARDS FROM OTHER AGENCIES

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.189
AND WE JUST REQUIRE THAT

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.258
PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD HERE MEET

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.960
THOSE STANDARDS -- AND AT THE

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.962
BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE PERSON

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.597
WHO SELLS THE PRODUCT TO PROVE

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:35.197
THAT THOSE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.666
COMPLIED WITH AND SO I MEAN I

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:37.333
THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.668
A BETTER WAY OF OF TRYING TO

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:39.769
ACCOMPLISH THIS.

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:42.071
I'VE KIND OF A RELATED QUESTION

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:45.308
AND IT -- IT IT GOES TO ONE OF

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:46.275
THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:47.510
PREFERRED THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.045
YOU'RE NOT ACCEPTING AND IT'S A

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:49.845
QUESTION THAT I HAD ALSO WHICH

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.080
IS THAT IF.

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:53.683
AN ANIMAL IS BEING RAISED FOR

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.351
ITS MEAT.

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:57.586
AND THERE IS A USE FOR ITS.

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.355
FOR WHAT IT NOT BE WASTEFUL THAN

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.557
TO DISCARD THE MEAT AND SO THESUGGESTION IS MADE THAT THE BILL

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.059
SHOULD HAVE CARVE OUT AN

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:05.127
EXCLUSION. FOR FURTHER CALL

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.395
FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY CAN YOU

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.097
EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.365
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO ADD TO

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:10.333
THE BILL BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE

01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:12.735
ADDED GOATS AND AND ANIMALS

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.270
WHERE THAT'S THE CASE AND THE

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.838
THE REALLY THE ISSUES COME

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.006
AROUND RABBITS.

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:20.409
AND THE CONCERNED WITH -- THE

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:21.944
SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND FOLKS

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:23.846
ON OUR SIDE IS THAT ARE OURS TWO

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.114
FOLD FIRST OF ALL THAT A LOT OF

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:26.749
THE RABBITS WHOSE FOR IS USE ARE

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.084
NOT MEET ANIMALS.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.685
THEIR ANIMALS THEIR RABBITS THAT

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:30.553
ARE REYES FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:31.721
FIRST OF THEIR NOT GENERALLY THE

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:34.090
SAME RABBITS AND SECONDLY THAT.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.524
RABBITS WITH THEM SORT OF FLOOD

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.593
THE MARKET -- TO REPLACE THE

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.928
OTHER TYPES OF FOR AND THAT

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.396
AGAIN THEY WOULDN'T BE USING

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:41.397
ANIMALS THAT WERE RAISED FOR

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:44.033
MEAT WE'RE STILL TALKING.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.568
TO KIND OF THE RABBIT INDUSTRY

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.036
TO SEE IF THERE IS A WAY OF

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:48.571
CARVING OUT YOU KNOW A NARROW

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.206
EXEMPTION FOR RABBITS THAT ARE

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:52.641
CLEARLY AND DEMONSTRABLY HAVE

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:53.943
BEEN RAISED FOR FOOD.

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:54.877
BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT THIS IS

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:57.279
NOT A BILL IT'S INTENDED TO DE

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:57.913
FACTO.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.682
BAND THE EATING OF RABBITS

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:00.282
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:02.218
TRYING TO DO AND I TOTALLY AGREE

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:02.952
THAT IF YOU'RE KILLING THE

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.520
ANIMAL FOR FOOD THAT YOU SHOULD

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:05.855
USE EVERY SINGLE BIT OF THAT

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.022
ANIMAL.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:08.090
ON THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT WE

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.125
DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.793
KILLING OF ANIMALS JUST FOR

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.327
THEIR FOR BECAUSE THAT'S

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:12.995
WASTEFUL AND NOT SUSTAINABLE AND

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:14.330
WE ARE AFRAID THAT THE RABBIT

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:16.198
EXEMPTION WOULD CREATE MORE FROM

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:18.134
MARKET TO DO JUST THAT SO WE ARE

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.101
STILL.

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:20.536
I'M IN DISCUSSIONS ON THAT ISSUE

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:22.037
BUT AT THIS MOMENT WE'RE NOT

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:25.107
AMENDING THE BILL -- WITH -- Là

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:25.841
ALLOWING RABBITS.

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:27.576
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE USE

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.111
BUILDINGS FOR HERE TO CONTINUE

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.846
WORKING WITH -- ALL OF THE

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:32.148
STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO GET TO A

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:33.516
PLACE THAT'S MORE OF A MIDDLE

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:34.383
GROUND.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.451
THE PROBLEM IS IS THE BILL

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.119
STANDS NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF US

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:38.687
WHO WE ARE PHILOSOPHICALLY WOULD

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:40.256

THE MIDDLE OF MAKES IT AWFULLY

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.159
DIFFICULT.

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:48.531
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK

WORKED ON A NUMBER OF THESE

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.538
ISSUES AND I DO THINK THIS IS AN

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:58.808
IN HUMANE PRACTICE -- ESPECIALLY.

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:01.977
WHEN IT'S CONSIDERED THERE'S NOT

01:08:02.044 --> 01:08:04.146
A NEED FOR THESE PART THERE'S

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:05.347

THAT EXISTS IN THIS INDUSTRY --

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:23.766
ISN'T OCCURRING HERE.

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.868

SO WE HAD THIS BILL AND WATER

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:41.050

THIS YOU KNOW SINCE THAT TIME?

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:50.259
AND I THINK IT JUST MAKES ME

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.328
MORE SYMPATHETIC WITH THE

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:55.130
OPPOSITION -- BECAUSE AS AS I

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:56.165
LOOKED INTO THIS ACTUALLY A LOT

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.733
OF THE FOR COMES FROM ACTUAL FOR

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.235
FARMS AND THESE ARE THESE ARE

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.737
SMALL FAMILY OWNED FARMS.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.073
WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY REYES?

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:06.509
OF THESE ANIMALS TO THEN YOU

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:09.211
KNOW HARVEST THE FOR ESSENTIALLY

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:10.279
IS WHAT THEY DO.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.548
RIGHT AND AND THERE'S NOT MANY

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:13.616
CALIFORNIA.

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.718
AND AND MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:16.352
THAT BUT I MEAN MOST SUMMER OUT

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:16.986
OF STATE.

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.354
MOST THE MANUFACTURES OF THE

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.257
STATE BUT THIS IS A LEGITIMATE

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:25.194
FARMING LIVESTOCK PRACTICE --

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.428
THAT'S GOING ON IT'S AND IT IS A

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.063
VERY LARGE INDUSTRY I'M NOT

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.131
FAMILIAR WITH IT PROBABLY NOT

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.433
MANY OF US UP HERE VERY FAMILIAR

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.336
WITH IT AT ALL -- WE PROBABLY

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:35.604
NEVER EVEN BEEN TO A FOR FARM.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.773
IF I NEVER IN TALK TO ANY OF

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.742
THESE FARMERS RIGHT -- IN THESE

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:40.876
THE SMALL FAMILY OWNED

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.845
BUSINESSES THAT NOW A HUGE

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:44.179
MARKET COULD PUT IT IN

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:45.381
CALIFORNIA COULD JUST BE TAKEN

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:49.785
OFF THE MAP I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:50.853
A PRETTY DRASTIC DECISION. TO

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.420
MAKE WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:52.655
PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.356
STATE REALLY AREN'T IN THIS ROOM.

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:55.925
THE MADE FOR THE BET THAT MOST

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:57.159
OF THEM LIVE IN OTHER STATES.

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.194
WHO MAYBE CAN'T BE IN THIS ROOM

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.163
RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW DURING THE

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.865
WORK DAY YOU KNOW?

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.466
YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS SO I

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.401
THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:06.602
ACCOUNT THESE THINGS YES YOU

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:08.537
DON'T HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:08.804
WITH IT.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:09.939
BUT US IS.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.740
THOSE OF US AS LEGISLATORS NEED

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:12.942
TO THINK ABOUT HEY WHAT ARE THE

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:15.077
OTHER WHAT ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:15.411
PERSPECTIVES.

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:16.879
WHO WERE IN THIS INDUSTRY OTHER

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.814
OTHER PEOPLE WERE IMPACT AND I

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:19.448
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WITH THIS

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:24.687
BILL -- BUT SO AS I AS I

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:25.921
UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT FROM

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.223
LAST TIME -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.593
FRIEDMAN.

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:33.128
IT'S IT IS IN HUMANE. TO RAISE

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:35.331
ANIMALS FOR FOR ONLY.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.900
BUT IT'S NOT IF THERE REYES FOR

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.768
FOOD IS THAT RIGHT.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.070
I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT IT'S

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:43.172
BLESSED SUSTAINABLE CERTAINLY.

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:44.239
I MEAN IS IN HUMANE OR I MEAN

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:45.874
THIS THIS IS ABOUT A MORAL

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.443
PRINCIPLE OF WERE NOT SOMETHING

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.078
TO MAN HER OR NOT RIGHT.

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:50.112
I I THINK THAT THERE'S A

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.447
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANIMALS THAT

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.748
FOR GENERATIONS HAVE BEEN

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:55.517
DOMESTICATED AND ADJUST AND DO

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.653
WELL IN CAPTIVITY AND THESE

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.321
ANIMALS WHICH ARE ARE BY NATURE

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.190
WILD ANIMALS BEING KEPT IN SMALL

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:03.559
CAGES OR BEING TRAPPED AND LEFT.

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:05.260
TO DIE YOU KNOW FOR MANY HOURS

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:07.329
IN THE WILDERNESS -- AND I THINK

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:08.464
THAT WITH THE ANIMALS THAT ARE

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.833
RAISED -- IN CAPTIVITY I HAVE

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.234
MORE COMFORT LEVEL THAT A LOT OF

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:13.836
THEM ARE BEING RAISED HUMANELY

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.070
AND IN KEEPING WITH.

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:17.206
OTHER NATURES THAT THEY DISPLAY

01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:18.240
WHERE IS WITH THESE ANIMALS WITH

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:19.608
THESE A PARTICULARLY EXOTIC

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:21.810
FIRST WE HAVE NO REGULATION WE

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.612
HAVE NO OVERSIGHT THIS IS MOSTLY

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.980
HAPPENED SHE SAID OUT OF STATE

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.415
AND OVERSEAS.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.083
AND I DO THINK THAT -- THERE'S A

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.485
HIGH PROBABILITY THAT A LOT OF

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.153
THESE ANIMALS HAVE SUFFERED IN

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.488
PRODUCING THE FOR OKAY SEE ABOUT

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.590
DOMESTICATION I MEAN THAT

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.325
DOMESTICATION IS AN AGE OLD

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:38.927
PRACTICE RIGHT WE HAVE.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:40.729
SOME OF OUR MOST LOVING PETS

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:43.799
DOGS ARE DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:44.933
THEY USED TO BE WILD AND YOU

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.535
COULD SAY -- WIRE WHY ARE WE

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.771
KEEPING THEM INDOORS WITH US SO

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.205
WHY ARE WE KEEPING THEM OUT IN A

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:51.140
PEN OUT.

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.374
OUTSIDE OR IN THE BACKYARD WE

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.742
SHOULD LET THEM ROAM FREE IN

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.377
WILD BECAUSE THAT'S SO WRONG I

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:57.212
MEAN THAT'S THE SAME LOGIC.

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:59.815
RED DOMESTICATION IS AN AGE OLD

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.817
ACCEPTED PRACTICE.

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:05.354
AND SO NOW THERE ARE GROUPS OR

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.588
DOMESTICATING.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.756
THESE ANIMALS YES IT'S IS MAYBE

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:08.691
NEWER BUT THEY'RE DOING THEY ARE

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.159
DOMESTICATING THEM HAVE YOU BEEN

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:11.360
TO A FOR FARM.

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:12.628
AND SEEN THAT HOW THESE PEOPLE

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.530
ARE RAISING THESE ANIMALS I HAVE

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:15.798
NOT BUT I DO HAVE THAT LEAVES

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:16.899
YOU IN MY DISTRICT AND I CAN

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:17.366
TELL YOU THERE'S A BIG

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.134
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOMESTICATED

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.703
ANIMALS AND THEIR RELATION TO

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.137
HUMANS AND THEIR COMFORT BEING.

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:23.906
KEPT IN CAPTIVITY AND ANIMALS

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:26.075
THAT ARE WILD ANIMALS -- AND

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.342
THEIR STRESS LEVEL WHEN THEY'RE

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:28.444
KEPT IN CAPTIVITY AND RAISED IN

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.879
CAPTIVITY AND THE ANIMALS THAT

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.648
WERE TALKING ABOUT -- IT'S BEEN

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:33.716
SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:36.452
THEY DO NOT DO WELL IN CAPTIVITY.

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.387
WELL THE MEDICATION IS A PROCESS

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:40.456
RIGHT AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.324
IT IS A PROCESS YOU'RE TAKING

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:43.659
ANIMAL MAYBE THAT USED TO BE

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:45.027
WILD AND DOMESTICATED.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.495
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE'VE

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:48.964
DONE THAT VERY SUCCESSFULLY WITH

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.332
LOTS OF OTHER ANIMALS.

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.366
AND SO I'LL GET BACK TO I MEAN

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:54.403
IS IT IS IT IN HUMANE TO RAISE A

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.105
CAL. TO BE SLAUGHTERED FOR ITS

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.506
BEEF AND THEN FOR ITS LEATHER IS

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:58.240
IT.

01:12:58.307 --> 01:12:59.742
I THINK THE SUPPORTERS OF YOUR

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.510
BILL OUT HERE THINK THAT IT IS.

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:02.978
DO YOU ARE YOU ASKING ME I'M

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.613
ASKING YOU I WOULD SAY IT REALLY

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.781
DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'RE TREATING

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:06.782
THEM WHEN THEY'RE ALIVE IT

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:09.051
EITHER IS OR IT ISN'T IS IT WELL

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.886
I I DISAGREE WITH THAT PROMISE

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.721
THAT WILL THEN OKAY DIFFERENCE.

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.590
LET ME LET ME COUNSELOR ASK YOUR

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:15.958
QUESTIONS AND BATCH OF THE WAY

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:17.860
THANK YOU ECONOMY COUNSELOR THIS

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:18.761
IS NOT A MORE.

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:23.265
I AM AN ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW -- BUT

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.767
SEE THE THERE YOU GO YOU SAY IT

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:25.734
DEPENDS ON WHAT HOW THEY'RE

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:28.070
REYES RIGHT OKAY -- WHY DOESN'T

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:30.339
IT DEPEND ON HOW THEY'RE RAISED?

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:31.874
IF THEY'RE BEING REYES.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.308
FOR FOR COULD MAYBE REYES TO

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.410
MAINLY FOR FOR AS WELL

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:35.711
[inaudible]

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.913
I AM.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.548
I DON'T I I THINK THAT POP

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.949
POSSIBLY FOR SOME TYPES OF

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.885
ANIMALS BUT FOR MANY NO I DON'T

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:43.986
THINK SO NOT THE WAY THAT THEY

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.487
ARE REYES TO MAKE IT ECONOMIC

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:46.188
FOR THEM.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:46.989
THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO KEEP

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:48.590
THE ANIMALS IN SMALL CAGES YOU

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:49.758
KNOW THERE I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.493
NOT HUMANE FOR ANY ANIMAL TO BE

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.961
KEPT ITS ENTIRE LIFE IN A SMALL

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:53.662
CAGE.

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:54.696
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE NATURE

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.565
IS TO BE WILD I DON'T THINK THAT

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:57.599
THAT IS.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.268
WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:00.836
HUMANE PRACTICE?

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.271
I WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT FROM --

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:03.539
DOMESTICATED ANIMALS EITHER

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.873
THAT'S WHY IN CALIFORNIA WE DO

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.141
HAVE STANDARDS ABOUT THE ROOM

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.309
THAT WE GIVE CHECK INS AND THE

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.877
VOTERS ARE VERY CLEAR WHEN THEY

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.212
PASSED THAT INITIATIVE THAT THEY

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.446
WANTED TO SEE ANIMALS RAISED IN

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:12.748
CALIFORNIA DONE IN A WAY THAT

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.183
THEY FELT WAS HUMANE SO I THINK.

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:15.818
OUR VOTERS HAVE AFFIRMED THAT

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:16.652
THAT THEY WOULD YOU WANT THE

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:18.086
STANDARD RATE AND THEY VOTED ON

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:20.088
IT THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT AN

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:21.690
INITIATIVE BUT WE DO WITH THAT

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.258
I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP WE

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:24.693
RAISE CHICKENS IN CAGES.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.563
NOW WE HAVE RULES ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:28.430
SPACE THAT HAS TO BE.

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:30.632
BUT CHICKENS ARE RAISED IN CAGES

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:33.335
IS THAT IT IS THAT IN HUMANE.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.837
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY DEPENDS ON

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:36.271
THAT LIKE I SAID I BELIEVE THAT

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.740
THERE ARE FARM PRACTICES THAT I

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.976
WOULD NOT CONSIDER TO BE HUMANE.

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:41.577
AND THEIR FARM PRACTICES THAT

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.612
ARE -- BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.447
CONFIDENCE THAT AND MUCH VAST

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:47.583
MAJORITY OF FOR FARMS ACROSS THE

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:48.483
WORLD FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:49.751
I'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S MUCH OF

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.320
AN ATTEMPT FOR THAT KIND OF

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:53.322
HUMANE.

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:55.023
A RAISING OF ANIMALS.

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:55.991
RIGHT BUT DON'T YOU SEE THAT IF

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:56.592
I PASS YOUR BILL TODAY IF WE

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.594
PASS YOUR BILL TODAY THE SAME

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.095
LOGIC.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.264
CAN NOW BE APPLIED TO THE CAL

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.799
CAN BE APPLIED TO THE CHICKEN

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:04.900
ARE YOU GONNA COME.

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:06.168
NEXT YEAR AND SAY HEY WE SHOULD

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:08.370
BAN ALL RAISING OF CHICKENS

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:09.972
THEIR CELL THAT'S RATHER

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.139
SPECULATIVE CAN WE STAY ON THE

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.174
TOPIC OF THE UNDERSIDE LIGHTING

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:13.542
I UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:14.509
THAT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ASK

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:15.978
HERE BUT MS FRIEDMAN AS ALL OF

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:17.179
US HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:17.546
POLICY.

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:18.347
FORWARD.

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:19.648
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT YOU

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.850
DON'T HAVE TO BUT DON'T TRY AND

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.685
ARGUE THE BILL IN A DIFFERENT

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:25.821
FORM THAT IS IN FRONT OF US.

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:27.055
MOM TRYING TO ARGUE THE

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:29.024
IMPLICATION OF THIS BILL IS THE

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.459
SAME LOGIC.

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:33.061
I MEAN IS WOULD YOU ALSO MAKE

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:35.063
THAT SAME ARGUMENT. FOR A BAND

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.732
IN.

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.734
ANY CAJUN OF CHICKENS OR VAN AND

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.637
YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.338
TO MAKE THAT SAME LOGIC THE BILL

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:44.907
IS BEFORE US IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:46.708
FORM AND ANY SPECULATION ABOUT

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:48.277
WHERE IT MAY LEAD IS MERELY

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.645
SPECULATION.

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.546
I UNDERSTAND MR GALLAGHER'S

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:53.215
ARGUMENT I DON'T AGREE WITH THE

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:54.883
PREMISE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND HIS

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:55.550
ARGUMENT.

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:56.952
THANK YOU HOW ABOUT HARVESTING

01:15:57.019 --> 01:16:00.122
OF WOOL FROM SHEEP.

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.124
WE SHARE SHE BETTER THEIR

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:03.725
WALLETS ALLOWABLE UNDER THE BILL

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.160
THAT'S ALLOWING WILL YES.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.296
BUT WE'RE IN THAT CASE WE ARE

01:16:07.362 --> 01:16:08.530
RAISING THAT.

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:11.033
SHE JUST TO TAKE ITS.

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.801
ITS WAR.

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.503
RIGHT IS THAT.

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:15.103
UNDER THIS BILL THAT IS A TRUE

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.204
STATEMENT.

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.607
YES IN THIS BILL WE ARE ABLE TO

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:19.274
USE.

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:23.478
MEET PRODUCING ANIMALS SHEEP

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:27.916
GOATS HOUSE. FOR THE NOT RABBITS.

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.451
RIGHT NOW NOT RABBITS WE ARE.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.119
DISCUSSING THAT'S A CONTINUING

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:36.625
DISCUSSION [inaudible]

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.193
I'M.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.995
WHAT ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:41.330
THIS IS A LARGE INDUSTRY I THINK

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:42.664
YOU POINTED THAT OUT IT'S OF

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:43.932
LARGER INDUSTRY?

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:45.634
AS I'VE SALAS LIKE TWO HUNDRED

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:46.568
FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:49.071
MANUFACTURED FOR GOODS IN THE

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:50.505
UNITED STATES.

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:51.640
LOTS OF FARMS LOTS OF

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.408
MANUFACTURING IF WE GET RID OF

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.110
THIS IN BAND ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:56.678
MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:59.147
CALIFORNIA -- THE REPLACEMENT

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:02.217
WILL BE PHùFOR RIGHT.

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.052
WHICH WE KNOW HAS ENVIRONMENTAL

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:06.588
IMPLICATIONS THAT THIS FAUX FUR

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:08.590
AS IT DETERIORATES CREATES MORE

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:09.891
PLASTICS.

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.327
IN THE WASTE STREAM WHICH I KNOW

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:12.961
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CARE A LOT

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:13.395
ABOUT.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.463
I MEAN ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THIS

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:16.865
COULD LEAD TO ALTERNATIVES THAT

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.633
ARE PRETTY DAMAGING TO THE

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.569
ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO COTTON WOOL

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:21.903
AND I'M WEARING.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.506
WELL RIGHT NOW -- NOT FIRST SO

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:25.140
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS PEOPLE

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:27.009
CAN WEARS CLOTHING TO KEEP THEM

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:27.509
WARM.

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.277
AND THEN THE BILL DOES ALSO

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:32.914
ALLOW -- CAL FOR AND SHE FOR FOR

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:34.483
WHICH A SHEARLING SO IF YOU

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:37.652
REALLY WANT FOR YOU CAN

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:38.653
CERTAINLY USE THOSE PRODUCTS.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.287
RIGHT BUT THE PHùFOR ARE YOU

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.789
CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT THE

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:41.790
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BECAUSE

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.725
THIS AS THIS POLICY GOES INTO

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:44.860
EFFECT OTHER.

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.628
ALTERNATIVES ARE GONNA COME INTO

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.363
THE MARKET PLACE MORE.

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:49.698
YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:50.799
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THAT

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:53.402
FAUX FUR NOW BEING MORE MORE IN

01:17:53.468 --> 01:17:54.970
THE MARKETPLACE.

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.905
I THINK THAT IT'S YOU KNOW AS AS

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:58.040
SGT SPURRIER'S ARGUMENT THERE'S

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:59.207
A LOT OF DIFFERENT FIBERS THAT

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:00.409
ARE ON THE MARKET THERE'S A LOT

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:01.743
OF TO I'VE SEEN PHùFOR MADE

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.311
OUT OF COTTON AND OTHER THINGS

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:06.114
AS WELL -- SO I THINK IT'S YOU

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:06.615
KNOW.

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:09.418
IN GENERAL I AM CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.420
POLYESTER AND AND FIBER BUT I

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:12.554
WILL SAY THAT PEOPLE PROBABLY

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:13.955
WASH THEIR COATS A LOT LESS THAN

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.557
THEY WASH THEIR YOGA PANTS.

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:16.958
I WAS GONNA WORRY ABOUT ONE I'D

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:18.493
WORRY MORE ABOUT THE MICRO

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.095
FIBERS COMING OFF OF CLOTHING

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:21.530
THAT'S WASHED MORE FREQUENTLY.

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.131
I DON'T WASH I DON'T HOW OFTEN

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.433
YOU WASH YOUR OVERCOATS BUT

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.068
PROBABLY NOT THAT OFTEN AND

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:26.701
THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.503
THE THE MICROFIBER ISSUE THAT'S

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:29.538
BEEN MENTIONED [inaudible]

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:31.306
OKAY.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.008
WELL LOOK I I THINK THAT THIS

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:34.409
SHOWS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.777
PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL THAT

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.212
WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:38.513
AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE MY

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.082
COLLEAGUES LIKE RATHER THAN HAVE

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:41.750
MAYBE.

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.151
WHAT MIGHT BE IN A AN INITIAL

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.953
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE OUT EVEN I

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.389
HAD TO RESPOND MAN WHOSE EVEN

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.690
WEARING FOR AT?

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:49.991
I DON'T WEAR IT.

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.093
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.327
KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M VERY

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.129
FAMILIAR WITH BUT AS YOU LOOK

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:55.797
INTO THIS LIKE YOU KNOW THERE

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.065
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO.

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.567
RIGHT AND THERE IS A MARKET

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:00.001
THERE IS A MARKET PLACE OUT

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.703
THERE FOR PEOPLE ARE SAYING.

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:03.572
DON'T DON'T USE FOR AND IT'S

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:05.240
WORKING THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:06.741
WHO ARE GOING AWAY FROM THAT.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.743
THE THE MARKET PLACES WORKING

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.412
FROM THAT STANDPOINT -- BUT

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:11.313
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:12.547
THERE AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.149
PEOPLE WHO ARE LEGITIMATELY

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:15.517
FARMING THEY'VE DOMESTICATED.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:19.187
ANIMALS -- IN A WAY THAT IS THAT

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:20.388
HAS.

01:19:20.455 --> 01:19:22.257
AN ACCEPTED PRACTICE AND I THINK

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:23.158
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT THE

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:24.926
IMPLICATIONS FOR THAT I DO THINK

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.528
THERE'S ALSO A DORMANT COMMERCE

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.096
CLAUSE ISSUE IN HERE.

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:29.831
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHO ARE WE

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.133
AFFECTING WE'RE NOT AFFECTING

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:32.601
OUR OWN PEOPLE WERE AFFECTING

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.035
PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES.

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:34.970
WHO ARE A BIG PART OF THIS

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.271
INDUSTRY AMHERST AND WE'RE

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:38.039
TAKING COMPLETELY OUT OF THE

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:40.642
MARKET PLACE THEIR ABILITY TO

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.611
SELL GOODS INTERSTATE -- THAT

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:44.579
THAT ARE LEGITIMATELY RAISE THAT

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.081
ARE HUMANELY RAISED.

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:47.382
THAT ARE USED THAT ARE USING

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:48.984
DOMESTICATION PRACTICES THAT WE

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.385
ALL ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HAD THE

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.588
BENEFIT OF TO THIS DAY WHEN YOU

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:54.456
EAT BEEF.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.557
YOUR BENEFITING FROM A

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.292
DOMESTICATION OF AN ANIMAL THAT

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.461
WE RAISE OKAY WE RAISE IT FOR

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:01.029
FOOD WE ALSO RESERVE FOR LEATHER.

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.397
WE ALSO RAISE IT FOR A LOT OF

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:05.901
OTHER THINGS -- INTO TO SOMEHOW

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.435
LIKE THIS POINT THIS OUT ONE

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.204
INDUSTRY.

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.672
IT'S GONNA HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:13.141
THEM WHEN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW A

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.209
WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT WE HAVEN'T

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:15.777
TAKEN THE TIME TO HEAR FROM

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.946
THOSE FOLKS -- ABOUT HOW IT

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:19.481
IMPACTS THEM ABOUT WHAT THEIR

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.082
PRACTICES ACTUALLY ARE THE

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.450
AUTHORS NEVER EVEN VISITED A FOR

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:23.685
FARM.

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:24.686
AND YET IS RUNNING A BILL IS

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.154

SMALL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.724
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.560
I THINK WE OWE THAT AT LEAST WHO

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:34.262

LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING OF

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:41.736
WHAT.

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:44.906

STAKEHOLDERS IN LOOKING FOR WAYS

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.734
WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.102
ADVERSELY AFFECT EVERYBODY.

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:16.371
IN FIGURING OUT HOW WE GET TO

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.640
WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND THAT'S

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.741
TO STOP THE IN HUMANE TREATMENT

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:22.978
OF ANIMALS TO STOP USING THE FOR

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:24.646
AND TO FIGURE OUT.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.982

YOU HAVEN'T VISITED THE FORM I

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.991
UNDERSTAND THAT -- MOST OF THOSE

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.192
ARE OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA.

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.394
AND YOU MADE A COMMENT EARLIER

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.396
ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA LEADS AND

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:42.264
WE DO LEAD.

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.798
AND TO THE VOTERS HAVE TOLD US

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:46.167

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:55.944
MISTER.-TO FROM ALL THE BACK AND FORTH I

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:57.178
JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR.

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:59.581
THIS BILL.

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.449
JUST PREVENTS THE SALE OF FOR

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:03.785
CORRECT.

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:05.353
OKAY BECAUSE THAT LINE OF

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.088
QUESTIONS THAT WE JUST WENT DOWN

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:08.356
WE COULD GO DOWN IN A COMPLETELY

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.658
DIFFERENT FORM BECAUSE WE'RE

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:10.759
TALKING ABOUT DOMESTICATED

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.560
ANIMALS WELL WHAT IF I WANTED A

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:15.130
FARM OF DOMESTICATED DOGS TO

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:16.831
START EATING AND WEARING.

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:19.267
YOU KNOW THAT'S I'M HOPING THAT

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.969
PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED ENOUGH TO

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:22.470
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:23.605
A GOOD IDEA.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.206
AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS EIGHT

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:26.241
PROBABLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:28.043
OF ANIMALS THAN OTHER FOLKS ON

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.744
THIS COMMITTEE I DON'T THINK

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:32.147
DOGS BELONG INSIDE I DO HAVE A A

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:34.182
HUGE RESPECT FOR ALL ANIMALS

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:35.350
BEING ABLE.

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:36.851
TO EXERCISE THEIR FREEDOM AND

01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:39.254
AND NATURAL STATE.

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.156
BUT THAT'S NOT THE SITUATION BY

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.024
WHICH WE LIVE IN SO I UNDERSTAND

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:44.959
THAT BUT THIS BILL ONLY HAS TO

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:45.927
DO.

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.362
WITH WHETHER WE HAVE EVOLVED

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.898
ENOUGH TO DECIDE THAT A CRUEL

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.533
TREATMENT OF ANIMAL FOR A

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.635
UNNECESSARY PRODUCT.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.337
SOMETHING WE CAN DO WITHOUT THAT

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:56.905
IS IN FACT.

01:22:56.971 --> 01:23:01.276
JUST A SYMBOL OF OF DECADENCE.

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.944
REALLY IN OUR SOCIETY AND HAS

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:05.046
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEED TO

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.715
KEEP WARM ANYMORE BECAUSE WE

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:07.982
HAVE OTHER IT IT'S EIGHTY

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:09.184
FASHION.

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.586
STATEMENT A STATEMENT OF WEALTH

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.855
I'M REALLY NOT CONCERNED EIGHT

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.623
AT A SPIRAL THAT WE'RE GETTING

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:18.426
INTO AS MAYBE MY A MY COLLEAGUE

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.028
I THINK ON THIS QUESTION IT'S

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:21.329
VERY CLEAR I WANT TO THANK YOU

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:22.864
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.232
I I WANNA YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.700
SUPPORT THE BILL IN AND CONTINUE

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:28.002
TO SUPPORT EFFORTS ONE BILL AT A

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:29.604
TIME AS WE BRING THEM FORWARD IF

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:30.905
THEY MAKE SENSE AND NOT GO DOWN

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.040
SOME BIZARRE.

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:33.375
DISCUSSION ABOUT DOMESTICATED

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:34.876
ANIMALS AND HOW WE DOMESTICATED

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:35.977
ANIMAL ON WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.512
SHOULD EAT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:38.680
BECAUSE I THINK THAT GETS US IN

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:39.547
A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT'S

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:41.549
REALLY GROSS.

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:42.851
SO -- AYE AYE AYE.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.219
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US AND I

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:48.723
HOPE WE ARE IN THIS DISCUSSION

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.959
SAM [inaudible]

01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:52.527
MR.

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:54.329
TO WAS ACTUALLY A MAKE.

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:55.430
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME POINT -- I

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:56.030
DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DEBATE

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:57.732
THIS TOO MUCH LONGER EXCEPT.

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:58.767
THE SUGGESTION THAT

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:01.102
DOMESTICATION SURE WOULD

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.203
POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR THE

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:03.671
JUSTIFICATION OF SKINNING DOGS

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:05.673
OR CATS I DON'T THINK THAT IS

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.674
WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM YUBA

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:13.681
CITY I WANT TO SAY THAT.

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.984
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE AUTHOR

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:19.220
OF THIS BILL HAS VISITED A FARM

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:20.021
THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN IN

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:21.923
HUMANE OR CORE PRACTICES DOESN'T

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.225
SUGGEST THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:25.527
THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE THAT WE

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:26.795
BANNED SUCH.

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:28.763
CRUEL AND HUMANE PRACTICES AND I

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:29.431
THINK THAT IS A PERSPECTIVE THAT

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:30.098
I SHARE.

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:32.233
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THERE

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.802
HAS BEEN A LOT OF INDICATION OF

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:34.736
THE CONSTITUTION.

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:37.839
TODAY -- ON ARGUMENTS THAT.

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.140
DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.775
LET ME JUST SAY IT'S BEEN

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.010
SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:42.844
VIOLATING DORMANT COMMERCE

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:43.511
CLAUSE.

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:44.712
AND FOR ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.414
CARES ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION IF

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.482
YOU COULD PLEASE READ THE

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:48.817
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BECAUSE

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:49.918
COMMITTEE STAFF TO SPEND AN

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:51.853
AWFUL LOT OF TIME. TO GO THROUGH

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.688
WHAT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE DOES OR

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:56.357
DOES NOT DO THIS BILL APPLIES TO

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.092
ALL FOR PRODUCTS ORIGINATING

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.828
ANYWHERE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.162
THEY'RE MANUFACTURED OR REYES

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:02.664
INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE STATE.

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:04.632
SO THERE IS NO BASIS FOR DORMANT

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:07.202
COMMERCE CLAUSE OBJECTION AND

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:07.969
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT WOULD

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:09.537
COME FROM SIMILARLY THE

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.072
SUGGESTION THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:12.740
VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.642
RIGHT TO FREE EXERCISE OF

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:17.712
RELIGION.

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.747
AGAIN -- THE BILL LAYS OUT

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:20.381
EXACTLY WHAT THE ARGUMENTS ARE

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:20.615
FOR IT.

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:21.916
WE CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE A

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:23.751
DISPUTE ABOUT IF THE BILL PASSES

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:24.786
A LOOK FOR TO SING THAT

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:25.987
CHALLENGING COURT UP BUT

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:27.722
INVOKING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.891
COMMUNITY INVOKING.

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:30.925
FIRST AMENDMENT.

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.360
IS IS IS TRULY BEYOND WHAT I

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:33.761
THINK.

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:34.696
THE COURTS HAVE SAID IN THIS

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.664
AREA ONE FINAL COMMENT I DO HAVE

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.166
FOR THE AUTHOR WHICH IS I DO

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:40.068
UNDERSTAND THERE'S A DISCUSSION.

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:42.337
WITH -- THE RABBITS INDUSTRY

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.005
ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN THIS AREA MY

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.740
UNDERSTANDING IS AT THIS TIME AS

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:46.908
I THINK YOU SAID RABBIT MEAT IS

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.042
NOT VERY POPULAR.

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:50.245
SO THE CONCERN IS IF RABBIT FOR

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.714
BECOMES REALLY THE SOLE MAJOR

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.015
KIND OF FOR THAT'S ALLOWED IN

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.650
CALIFORNIA IT WILL POTENTIALLY

01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:56.951
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.453
OF RABBITS WERE KILLED AND

01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.187
INSTEAD OF RABBITS BEING RACE

01:25:59.254 --> 01:25:59.988
FOR ME.

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:01.556
THEY COULD BE GRACED FOR FOR

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:02.757
SOME MORE RAISE RABBITS WOULD BE

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.259
RAISED FOR SLAUGHTER.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.628
I HAVE TO ADMIT I I I AM VERY

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:08.563
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:11.432
MINUTES ON THIS I DO HOPE AND I

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:12.233
KNOW YOU WILL.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.234
ABOUT THIS VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:14.269
WHETHER WE WOULD ALLOW A FUTURE

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.937
EXEMPTION IN THIS AREA AT THIS

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:17.071
MOMENT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.740
BE SOMETHING I WOULD SUPPORT --

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:20.742

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:59.420
SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:00.822
DOCTOR LYNN HANEY PROFESSOR OF

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:04.292
SOCIOLOGY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY.

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:06.394
AND ESTEBAN NUNEZ -- WITH THE

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:10.598
ANTI RECIDIVISM.

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:12.466
COALITION.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:13.100
THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:16.170
THANK YOU -- I PRESIDENT HANEY

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.104
FROM YORK AND I'M HERE ON YOUR

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.906
COAST -- BECAUSE FOR THE PAST

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:20.641
FOUR YEARS I'VE HAD A NATIONAL

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:21.976
SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANT AND

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.344
I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:24.545
POPULATIONS OF PARENTS WHO ARE

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:27.448
CARS RATED WITH CHILD SUPPORT --

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:29.317
DEBT AND I'VE DONE ALL OVER THE

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.085
COUNTRY HUNDREDS OF INTERVIEWS

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.721
AND OBSERVED OVER A THOUSAND

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:35.256
CHILD SUPPORT CASES.

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.225
AND IN THE WORK I'VE REALLY BEEN

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.560
STUNNED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:41.896
THIS POPULATION OF PARENTS --

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:43.898
AND REALLY THE LACK OF ATTENTION

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:46.200
TO IT -- PARENTS ACCUMULATE

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:47.768
ENORMOUS CHILD SUPPORT AT WHEN

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:49.303
THEY GO TO PRISON.

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:51.105
IN MY RESEARCH THE AVERAGE

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:52.340
AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT A PRISONER

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:54.775
HAS WHEN HE OR SHE MOSTLY HE IS

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:58.412
RELEASED IS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:31:58.479 --> 01:31:59.647
DOLLARS -- THAT'S ABOUT THREE

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:01.115
TIMES THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.984
CHILD SUPPORT DEBT FOR LOW

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:05.519
INCOME PARENTS -- AND IT'S

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:08.089
PRETTY OBVIOUS WHY THIS OCCURS --

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:10.658
WHEN INCARCERATED PARENTS GO TO

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:11.626
PRISON THEY HAVE OR WHEN THEY'RE

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:12.526
IN PRISON THEY HAVE REALLY NO

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:14.028
WAY TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:16.297
ORDERS -- AS A MEMBERJUST

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.466
MENTIONED THEY IF IF THEY GET A

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:20.568
JOB MOST OF THEM ARE --

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.303
INVOLUNTARILY UNEMPLOYED BUT IF

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.237
THEY DO GET A JOB IT'S ALWAYS

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.872
UNDER ABOUT A DOLLAR AN HOUR.

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.574
AND THEIR CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.976
AVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:29.944
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:32.346
SO THE DEBT IS IS IS OBVIOUS HOW

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:33.547
WOULD A CRUISE -- AND I ALSO

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.815
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:37.351
THAT IT HAS THIS THIS SORT OF

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:38.386
PROVING OF DEBT HAS A

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:39.987
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.956
AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND LATINO

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:42.657
MEN.

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:44.258
WHO AS WE KNOW ARE OVER

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:46.260
REPRESENTED AMONG -- IN OUR

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:47.995
PRISON POPULATIONS -- SO WHEN

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:51.766
THEY GET OUT -- PARENTS WHO ARE

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:54.101
FORMALLY INCARCERATED PARENTS --

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:55.169
THE THE EFFECTS REALLY CAN BE

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.438
DEVASTATING FOR THEM OF THE

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:58.906
STAFF IT REALLY WAYS THEM DOWN.

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:01.609
IF YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF DEBT

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:02.243
THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:03.344
WERE SUBJECTED IN THE IN

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.279
CALIFORNIA TO AUTOMATIC

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:06.814
ENFORCEMENT MEASURES LIKE THE

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:07.815
REVOCATION OF YOUR DRIVER'S

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.650
LICENSE WHICH THEN MAKES IT HARD

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:10.885
TO FIND EMPLOYMENT.

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:12.887
LAKE MANDATORY WAGE GARNISHMENT

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:14.355
SO IF YOU DO FIND A JOB.

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.757
YOUR WAGES ARE ARE GARNISHED --

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:18.092
TO A POINT THAT MAKES IT REALLY

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.528
HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET -- AND

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:22.263
LEANS ON BANK ACCOUNTS AND

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.764
PROPERTY THAT ALSO MAKE IT HARD

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.166
TO STABILIZE YOUR LIFE AND IN

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:27.735
TURN ALL OF THAT THEN CAN LEAD.

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.971
TO RECIDIVISM -- AS PARENTS GO

01:33:30.037 --> 01:33:31.872
UNDERGROUND TO AVOID THIS AND

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:34.375
EVEN TO CRIME -- JUST LITERALLY

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.177
TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND THEN ALL

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.346
OF THIS HAS A REALLY NEGATIVE

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:39.780
TOLL ON CHILDREN THE MIX CO

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.882
PARENTING VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN --

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.651
THE KIND OF COMBINATION OF OF

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:45.686
GUILT AND PRESSURE THAT PARENTS

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:45.886
FEEL.

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:48.823
SO FROM MY RESEARCH -- THE I'VE

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.791
I'VE CONCLUDED THE ONLY WAY TO

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.727
STOP THE CYCLE FROM HAPPENING IS

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.729
TO STOP THE DEBT FROM ACCRUING

01:33:54.795 --> 01:34:01.068
IN THE FIRST PLACE -- AND THAT

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:03.838
WOULD BE A MEASURE LIKE TEN

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:04.972
NINETY ONE SO I SUPPORT IT FULLY

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.574

PREVIOUSLY -- I ACTUALLY LEARNED

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:33.053
THAT -- SO MUCH OF CHILD SUPPORT

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.923

CALIFORNIA GOES TO THE STATE NOT

MAJORITY OF OF THE CHILD SUPPORT

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:05.652
DEBT IS ACTUALLY GO TO THE STATE

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.958
AMOUNT IN THE UNITED STATES --

01:42:11.024 --> 01:42:13.327
AND WHAT'S ALSO. ONE OF THE

01:42:13.393 --> 01:42:15.362
HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY IS -- AS

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:17.397

CALIFORNIA IS A VERY VERY HIGH

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:24.371
END OF WHAT OTHER STATES DO A

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:26.073
MANY MANY STATES DON'T CHARGE

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:27.007
ANY INTEREST.

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:28.775
AND MANY MANY OTHER STATES

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:31.345
CHARGE ABOUT HALF TO ONE THIRD

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.814
OF CALIFORNIA CHARGES -- AND THE

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:36.517
RESULT OF THIS INTEREST -- BUT

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:38.752
HIGH INTEREST RATE IS REALLY THE

01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:39.520
THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:41.188
DEBT THAT I THAT I MENTIONED

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:43.957
EARLIER -- OR THE NINE BILLION

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:46.126
DOLLARS OF INTEREST AT THAT IS

01:42:46.193 --> 01:42:48.896
OWED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

BY.

01:42:49.796 --> 01:42:52.032
POOR PARENTS BY DEFINITION RIGHT

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.267

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:54.935
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE YOU ARE A POOR

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:56.270
PARENT SO WE'RE ESSENTIALLY

01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:58.872
PUTTING NINE BILLION DOLLARS ON

01:42:58.939 --> 01:42:59.506
THE BACKS OF OUR I'M SORRY TO

CHILD SUPPORT HALF OF THAT IS

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:06.013
INTERESTS AND HALF OF THE

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:07.381
INTEREST IS FOR PUBLIC

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:09.383
ASSISTANCE SO THE POINT -- WE'RE

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:10.751
BASICALLY PUTTING THAT ON THE

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:12.352
BACKS OF OF POOR FAMILIES.

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:14.821
AND AS HAS BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY

01:43:14.888 --> 01:43:16.089
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY ON

01:43:16.156 --> 01:43:18.759
COLLECTIBLE -- IT'S IN THAT'S

01:43:18.825 --> 01:43:20.193
BAD FOR THE STATE TO HAVE THAT

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.095
KIND OF ON COLLECTIBLE THAT ON

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.530
THE BOOKS -- THE DEPARTED CHILD

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:25.365
SUPPORT SERVICES HAS INFORMED ME

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:28.335
THAT ABOUT 1% OF INTEREST THAT

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:30.771
GETS PAID BACK EVERY YEAR 299%

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:32.773
IS NOT PAID BACK IT JUST

01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:34.074
CONTINUES TO A CROW.

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:34.908
WHICH IS BAD FOR THE STATE AND

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.743
IT'S ALSO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:39.446
DEVASTATING FOR FOR FAMILIES AND

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:40.647
AND PARENTS.

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:42.149
I DISTRIBUTED THE CHART THAT I

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:45.118
THAT I THAT I'VE CONSTRUCTED TO

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:47.988
SHOW HOW DEBT REALLY SPIRALS OUT

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:50.624
OF CONTROL WHEN YOU CHARGE 10%

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:52.392
INTEREST ON IT AND IT BASICALLY

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:54.661
MAKES IT UNPAYABLE.

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:55.429
UP AT LEAST PEOPLE IN DEBT

01:43:55.495 --> 01:43:57.397
FOREVER -- AND THEN THAT'S BAD

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:58.365
FOR OBVIOUSLY FOR PARENTS WHO

01:43:58.432 --> 01:43:59.967
HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:01.501
TO PAY THE STATE BACK OVER THEIR

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:02.536
CHILDREN.

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:03.570
OR THE OR THEIR CHILDREN'S

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.772
MOTHERS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED --

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:07.174
AND SO THAT'S BAD FOR MOTHERS

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:07.841
BECAUSE THEY GET REALLY GET LESS

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:09.943
MONEY WITH THIS INTEREST AND

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:11.712
IT'S OF COURSE ALSO MOST

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:15.148
IMPORTANTLY -- BAD FOR CHILDREN --

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:16.750
WHO RECEIVE LESS MONEY AND

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:20.387
ULTIMATELY LESS CARE FROM THERE --

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:22.222
NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS.

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:25.726
SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:27.027

ON CHILD SUPPORT THE TO THE GUY --

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:10.804
MEANT UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:11.271
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL --

01:45:11.338 --> 01:45:12.105
PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN WHO

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:13.874
ARE INVOLVED IN THE CHILD

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:14.608
SUPPORT SYSTEM.

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:15.876
MANY OF WHOM ARE OF COLOR IN OUR

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:17.444
SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:17.744
RESIDENTS.

01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:18.679
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:19.312
STATED A CALIFORNIA CHARGES ONE

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:21.248
OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF INTEREST

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:21.882
ONE CHILD SUPPORT THAT IN THE

01:45:21.948 --> 01:45:22.816
COUNTRY.

01:45:22.883 --> 01:45:24.584
HIGHER THAN TEXAS HI THE

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:26.420
VIRGINIA HIGHER THAN EVEN

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:28.255
MISSISSIPPI AND CERTAINLY HIGHER

01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:30.490
THAN THE STATES THAT DON'T

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:31.692
CHARGE.

01:45:31.758 --> 01:45:32.359
INTEREST ON CHILD SUPPORT IT AT

01:45:32.426 --> 01:45:36.029
ALL I THINK THAT THE IMPACT OF

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:37.230
THE THE HIGH INTEREST RATE IN

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:38.365
CHILD ON CHILD SUPPORT IT IN

01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:39.266
CALIFORNIA.

01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:42.035
IS ELUCIDATED BY COMPARING THE

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:43.503
STATE TO OTHERS -- SO FOR

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:45.238
EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND THREE STUDY

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:47.207
COMMISSIONED BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:45:47.274 --> 01:45:49.009
DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT.

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:50.377
OF SHOW THAT.

01:45:50.444 --> 01:45:54.614
BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IN.

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:55.849
TWO THOUSAND ONE THE LEVEL OF

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:56.883
CHILD SUPPORT DEBT.

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:58.852
A IN CALIFORNIA A ROSE FROM

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:01.088
AROUND TWO BILLION TO OVER

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:03.156
SIXTEEN BILLION.

01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:04.357
AND COMPARE TO NEW YORK.

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:07.294
WHERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.295
LEVEL CHILD SUPPORT THAT WAS

01:46:08.361 --> 01:46:09.696
ABOUT TWO BILLION IN A ROSE THE

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:11.498
ONLY THREE POINT THREE POINT TWO

01:46:11.565 --> 01:46:12.299
BILLION?

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:13.900
AND THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:15.936
DIFFERENCE WAS LARGELY THE

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:18.805
INTEREST CHARGE ON CHILD SUPPORT

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:19.172
DEBT.

01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:20.507
SO I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT TO

01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:22.709
OTHERS ARE MADE ABOUT WHY THIS

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:23.877
IS A COUNTER PRODUCTIVE.

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:26.046
UP POLICY BUT I WILL SAY A

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:27.447
COUPLE OF THINGS WE KNOW THAT.

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:29.149
AGAIN FROM AT TWO THOUSAND THREE

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:29.816
STUDY.

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:32.652
THAT OVER SEVENTY FIVE SAID

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:33.887
ABOUT 75%.

01:46:33.954 --> 01:46:35.622
OF PEOPLE WHO OWE CHILD SUPPORT

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:38.425
DEBT HAD ORDERS THAT WERE MORE

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:39.359
THAN THEY COULD AFFORD IN THE

01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:40.427
FIRST PLACE.

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:43.830
IN OVER 70% OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:44.865
CHILD SUPPORT DEBT.

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.399
EARN LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:47.134
DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.337
SO WE ESSENTIALLY TACKING ON 10%

01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:52.339
COMPOUND INTEREST ON PRINCIPLE

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:54.307
THE PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD. TO

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:56.076
PAY IN THE FIRST PLACE AT LEAST

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:57.611
A WAGE GARNISHMENT.

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:58.945
SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSES

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.914
PROFESSIONAL LICENSES WHICH IN

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:03.383
TURN UNDERMINES PEOPLE'S ABILITY

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:05.085
TO EARN AND PAY CHILD SUPPORT.

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:06.753
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DEBT THAT

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:07.888
IS PAID IS PAID TO THE

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:10.490
GOVERNMENT MOSTLY AND DOES NOT

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:11.024
GO TO CHILDREN.

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:12.125
IN THE SIM.

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:13.827
CHAIRMAN STONE AS YOU AS YOU

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:14.594
MENTION.

01:47:14.661 --> 01:47:16.129
THE INCREASE IN CHILD SUPPORT

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:17.898
DEBT CAN HAVE DELETERIOUS

01:47:17.964 --> 01:47:20.300
EFFECTS ON FAMILY RELATIONS AND

01:47:20.367 --> 01:47:23.570
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PARENTS

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:26.039
AND THEIR CHILDREN.

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:26.973
ARMY CAUSING ESTRANGEMENT.

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.975
AND SO OF THAT IS OBVIOUSLY

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:30.677
FUNDAMENTALLY AS YOU SAID AT

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:32.612

LEGAL NATURE OF THE ISSUE IN

THAT NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR

01:53:34.974 --> 01:53:36.609
THEIR OWN REGULATIONS WILL HAVE

THEIR OWN -- FAQS ON OF AND

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:41.915
ADDITIONALLY THIS WOULD ALLOW

01:53:41.981 --> 01:53:43.383
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO THE TO

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:45.652
DO THE SAME SOME PLAYERS WOULD

01:53:45.718 --> 01:53:46.819

THERE'S NO PRE EMPTION HERE

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:49.722
THERE WOULD BE NO DETERMINATION

01:53:49.789 --> 01:53:51.224
WHAT AGENCY ACTUALLY SUPERSEDES

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.158
THE OTHER.

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:53.459
SO THEY COULD HAVE REGULATIONS

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.061
REGARDING BOTH FOR RETALIATION

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:56.629
UNDER BOTH CODE SECTIONS AND

01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:58.031
THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:53:58.097 --> 01:53:58.631
ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A

01:53:58.698 --> 01:54:00.266
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AND WE

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:01.167
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:02.468
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.

01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:04.170
HOWEVER THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:06.105
ARE RIGHT FOR ABUSE IN THAT AND

01:54:06.172 --> 01:54:08.942
AN EMPLOYEE CAN ALLEGE THAT THEY

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.777
WERE SEXUALLY HARASSED -- BEFORE

01:54:10.843 --> 01:54:12.178
A FINDING BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OR

01:54:13.613 --> 01:54:15.481
BEFORE FINDING BY THE COURT AND

01:54:15.548 --> 01:54:16.482
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:17.917

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:18.718
HARASSMENT.

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:19.586
AND THEREFORE THERE'S A

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:21.221
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION -- THAT

01:54:21.287 --> 01:54:22.589

DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN

01:54:23.656 --> 01:54:25.391
AGAINST THAT EMPLOYEE IS BECAUSE

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:27.327
THEY FILED THIS RETIRE BECAUSE

01:54:27.393 --> 01:54:27.961

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:28.861
COMPLAINT.

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:30.129
AND THE CONCERN IS IS THAT IT

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:32.098
ALLOWS FOR ABUSE OF THE ISSUE

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:33.066
BECAUSE IN THE CAN FILE THESE

01:54:33.132 --> 01:54:35.201

PROTECTION FOR THIRD PARTIES.

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:04.563
IF THE HARASSMENT HAPPENS BY A

THIRD PARTY SO OF THE HARASSMENT

02:05:12.404 --> 02:05:13.739
IS BY THE SUPERVISOR.

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:15.274
OF THE THIRD PARTY THERE'S

02:05:15.341 --> 02:05:16.842

IF THEY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE

02:05:27.853 --> 02:05:30.356
KNOWN -- ADDITIONALLY EVEN IF

02:05:30.422 --> 02:05:32.791
IT'S BY A THIRD PARTY THEMSELVES

02:05:32.858 --> 02:05:34.526
TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THAT HIRING

02:05:34.593 --> 02:05:36.762
ENTITY THEN THERE'S LIABILITY IF

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:38.497
THE HIRING ENTITY KNEW OR SHOULD

02:05:38.564 --> 02:05:40.532
HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS THIRD PARTY

02:05:40.599 --> 02:05:43.035
WAS -- HARASSING INDIVIDUAL.

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:44.603
EVEN IF.

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:46.639
THE PERSON DOESN'T ACTUALLY FALL

02:05:46.705 --> 02:05:48.173
UNDER THIS PERSON PROVIDING

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.409
SERVICES PURSUANT TO A CONTRACT.

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:51.977
THEY'RE STILL LIABILITY IF THE

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:53.479
HIRING ENTITY KNEW OR SHOULD

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:55.748
HAVE KNOWN SO WHAT AB ONE

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:57.249
SEVENTY ACTUALLY DOES IS IT

02:05:57.316 --> 02:05:59.418
ENCOMPASSES THE SITUATION WHERE

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:02.121
A LABOR CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE.

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:04.056
ARE HARASSING EACH OTHER BECAUSE

02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:05.124
THAT'S WHERE THERE'S NO

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.725
LIABILITY OR THERE'S AND THIS

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.661
WOULD ASSUME DIRECT LIABILITY

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:10.195
JOINT LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:11.931
KNOWLEDGE REGARDLESS OF ANY SORT

02:06:11.997 --> 02:06:13.465
OF CONTROL THAT THE HIRING HD

02:06:13.532 --> 02:06:15.701
HAS OVER THE WORKPLACE SITUATION.

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.369
AND WOULD IMPOSE DIRECTLY

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:19.038
ABILITY IN THOSE SITUATIONS AND

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:20.072
THAT'S WHERE CONCERN LIES

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:21.607
BECAUSE THEN THE HIRING ENTITY

02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:22.908
THE CLIENT EMPLOYER IN THESE

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:24.576
SITUATIONS DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:06:24.643 --> 02:06:26.078
ABILITY TO CURTAIL THE

02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:27.179
HARASSMENT BECAUSE THEY HAD NO

02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:28.080
KNOWLEDGE OF IT.

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:29.281
AND THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:31.317
THIS THIRD PARTY AND SO IF THERE

02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:32.851
IS CONTROL ALREADY UNDER THE LAW

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.453
AND IF THERE IS A NEW OR SHOULD

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:35.788
HAVE KNOWN.

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:37.089
AS STANDARD THAN THAT HIRING

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.824
ENTITY IS ALREADY GOING TO BE

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:40.726

02:06:49.401 --> 02:06:50.602
CLIENT PLAYERS.

02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:52.938
AND THEREFORE AM IS UNNECESSARY

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:53.706
TO THE EXTENT THESE NEW

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:54.940
PROVISIONS ARE ADDED THEY ARE

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:56.408
CONFUSING AND THAT'S WHERE WE

02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:58.110
ARE CONCERNED AS WELL WE'RE

02:06:58.177 --> 02:06:58.911

OTHER CLIENTS I WANTED.

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:20.065
TO THIS BILL IS PATTERNED AFTER

02:07:20.132 --> 02:07:22.034
A BE -- EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN

02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:23.035
THE HERNANDEZ BILL OF A COUPLE

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:24.336
OF YEARS AGO WHERE WE CREATED

02:07:24.403 --> 02:07:26.438
STATUTORY LIABILITY JOINT

02:07:26.505 --> 02:07:29.074
EMPLOYER LIABILITY. FOR NON

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:33.479
VERIFICATION OF WORKERS

02:07:33.545 --> 02:07:34.913
COMPENSATION COVERAGE.

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:36.849
BOTH OF WHICH I GUESS WE VIEW AS

02:07:36.915 --> 02:07:40.185
OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE -- ONE

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:41.520
FOR THE CLIENT EMPLOYER TO

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:43.489
DETERMINE QUITE READILY FROM THE

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:46.558
CONTRACTED EMPLOYEES AND AND

02:07:46.625 --> 02:07:48.594
THEIR DIRECT EMPLOYER -- THE

02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:50.496
ISSUE OF HARASSMENT ON THE OTHER

02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:54.400
HAND IS NOT THAT OBJECTIVELY

02:07:54.466 --> 02:07:55.334
VERIFIABLE.

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:55.968
SO THAT'S THE FIRST CONCERN WE

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:58.404
HAVE THE SECOND CONCERN IS IS

02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:59.738
THAT DESPITE FIAT HAVING.

02:07:59.805 --> 02:08:01.106
BOTH NOTICE AND TRAINING

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:03.942
REQUIREMENTS -- UPON EMPLOYERS

02:08:04.009 --> 02:08:05.844
THERE IS NO SORT OF GOOD FAITH

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:07.379
DEFENSE FOR LACK OF A BETTER

02:08:07.446 --> 02:08:10.315
DESCRIPTION -- I THINK YOUR

02:08:10.382 --> 02:08:11.550
COMMITTEE COUNT YOUR COMMITTEE

02:08:11.617 --> 02:08:13.419
ANALYSIS IN YOUR COMMITTEE

02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:14.987
COUNSEL MISTER CLARK HAS DONE.

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:16.555
A VERY GOOD JOB IN LAYING OUT

02:08:16.622 --> 02:08:18.257
THE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES IN

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:19.925
EXPLAINING.

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:21.727
I THINK THE CASE LAW AND WHAT

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:22.995
ARE THE PARAMETERS OF THE FEE

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:24.396
OUR STATUTE.

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:25.464
I GUESS I WOULD SLIGHTLY

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:27.199
DISAGREE WITH ONE OF THE POINTS

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:29.601
ALL ALL AGREE ON PAGE SIX WITH

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.170
THE DESCRIPTION THAT THE PRIMARY

02:08:31.236 --> 02:08:33.439
PURPOSE OF FEE HA AFTER ALL.

02:08:33.505 --> 02:08:34.673
IS NOT TO ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:36.275
WHO'S BEEN HARASSED TO SUE THE

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:37.176
EMPLOYER.

02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:38.977
RATHER ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO

02:08:39.044 --> 02:08:40.612
REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.414
LEARN OF THE HARASSMENT TO TAKE

02:08:42.481 --> 02:08:43.382
IMMEDIATE AND APPROPRIATE

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:44.850
CORRECTIVE ACTION TO STOP THE

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:46.151
HARASSMENT.

02:08:46.218 --> 02:08:47.786
AND PREVENT FURTHER HARM A

02:08:47.853 --> 02:08:48.954
STATEMENT WHICH WE WOULD

02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:50.522
OBVIOUSLY AGREE TO IT IS THE LAW

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:52.958
BUT I THINK THAT IS THE INTENDED

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:54.026
PURPOSE.

02:08:54.093 --> 02:08:56.462
BUT ON THE NEXT PAGE -- THE NODE

02:08:56.528 --> 02:08:59.398
IS THAT AB -- ONE SEVENTY WILL

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:01.133
NOT CHANGE ANY LIABILITY THE

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:02.668
PROBLEM IS THAT THE EXPLICIT

02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:05.104
LANGUAGE FROM OUR STANDPOINT IN

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:06.772
AB ONE SEVENTY SAYS.

02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:08.240
THAT THE KLA CLIENT EMPLOYER

02:09:08.307 --> 02:09:10.909
WILL SHARE BOTH RESPONSIBILITY

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:12.344
WHICH SPEAKS TO THE FIRST POINT

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:14.213
BUT ALSO SHARE IN THE CIVIL

02:09:14.279 --> 02:09:15.447
LIABILITY.

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:17.583
SO I'D LIKE TO AT LEAST SUGGEST

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:19.184
THAT PERHAPS STARTING WITH THE

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.986
FIRST PROVISION IS WHERE WE

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:22.688
SHOULD GO BEFORE IMPOSING

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:24.756
LIABILITY AND THE LAST ITEM THAT

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:25.891
I WOULD RAISE WITH THE COMMITTEE

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:27.126
IS IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL

02:09:27.192 --> 02:09:29.595
REFERENCES. TO TWENTY EIGHT TEN

02:09:29.661 --> 02:09:30.562
POINT THREE AND ONE OF THE

02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:31.930
DEFINITIONS THAT IS NOT PICKED

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:32.831
UP.

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:35.367
IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF AB ONE

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:35.968
SEVENTY ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:37.269
THERE ARE SOME COMMITTEE

02:09:37.336 --> 02:09:38.871
AMENDMENTS AND PERHAPS IT'S IN

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:39.104
THERE.

02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:41.773
IS A EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX IN TWENTY

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:42.941
TEN POINT THREE WHICH DEFINES

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:44.243
THE TERM USUAL COURSE OF

02:09:44.309 --> 02:09:46.145
BUSINESS BECAUSE IT DEFINES IT

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:47.646
AS A WORK PERFORMED WITHIN OR

02:09:47.713 --> 02:09:48.881
UPON THE PREMISES.

02:09:48.947 --> 02:09:50.349
OR WORK SITE OF THE CLIENT

02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:53.085
EMPLOYER WITHOUT THAT LIMITATION

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:55.020
THEN BOTH THE RESPONSIBILITY AND

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:56.822
THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROPOSED TO

02:09:56.889 --> 02:09:59.191
BE IMPOSED BY AB ONE SEVENTY

02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:03.428
WOULD GO BEYOND THE PREMISES OF

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:03.762
THE WORK SITE.

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:05.864
