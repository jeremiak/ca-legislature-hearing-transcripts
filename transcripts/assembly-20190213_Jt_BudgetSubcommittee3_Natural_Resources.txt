WELCOME YOU ALL HERE TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND FIRE -- ON ON OUR STATES WATERSHED AND WATER SUPPLY. THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACTS RANGING FROM HEALTH TO INSURANCE TO LOCAL PLANNING. WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS BOTH IN BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE AND THEN POLICY COMMITTEES ABOUT WHAT ELSE THE STATE CAN DO TO REDUCE. THE IMPACT OF FIRE IN THE FUTURE BUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE NATURAL SOURCE IMPACTS. IN THIS HEARING I HOPE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AND WILDFIRE ARE IMPACTING OUR NATURAL SOURCES. HEAR FROM SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT MAKE GRANTS FOR THE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF FORESTS AND WATERSHEDS. AND EXAMINE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE IN A TIMELY WAY. GIVEN THE POLICY OVER LATER THIS TOPIC I AM. VERY PLEASED AND WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE -- OF THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING JOINTLY WITH OUR ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE -- CHAIR FRIEDMAN FROM THAT COMMITTEE IS HERE NOW AND TO TO TO ONE OF OF SAFE YOU INTRODUCTORY WORDS I JUST SAID I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PARTICIPATE TODAY I'M HAPPY THAT ARE TOO COMMITTEES ARE -- JOINING TOGETHER TO HOLD A HEARING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE A WE LOVE OUR FARCE IN CALIFORNIA -- AND I THINK EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN VERY DISMAYED BY THE INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOREST FIRES THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING. A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THE LARGEST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S RECORDED HISTORY I'M CAL FIRE KEEPS RECORDS ABOUT FIRES IN EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THE AMOUNT OF FIRE THAT WE'RE HAVING IS INCREASING AS WELL AS THE FEROCITY OF THOSE FIRES. AND WHAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. IS THAT OUR WATERSHEDS WHICH ARE IN THE FAR AS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY FIRE OR THE MAJOR SOURCE OF WATER RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIA SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE FIRES HAVING ON OUR WATER RESOURCES -- BUT ALSO TO DISCUSS HOW CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS BEEN FUELING THESE FIRES IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THESE CHALLENGES IN THE YEARS TO COME. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK AGAIN MISTER BLOOM -- FOR CONVENING THESE HEARINGS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HAVE JOINED US THREE OF US AND MARK STONE. AND ALSO TO JUST REMIND EVERYONE THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AN ACCIDENT SEVERAL NEW LAWS. TO DEAL WITH FORESTRY AND WITH WATER SHEDS AND ALL OF THESE RESOURCES BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO SO I'M REALLY. HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND START THAT WORK THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE OR MISERY THIS -- ANY ANY COMMENTS YOU THE TWO WELL ASSEMBLYMEMBER SAYS ONE OF OUR NEW MEMBERS OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE THIS IS HER FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIND -- TO OF BEING A PART OF THIS COMMITTEE VERY -- EDUCATIONAL INTERESTING AND PLACE WHERE -- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ADD -- TO IMPORTANT WORK TO WELCOME ABOARD. AND WE'RE ALSO WELCOMING TODAY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS AS ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- THREE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY INTRODUCTORY REMARKS BUT WE DO WANT -- TO WELCOME YOU AS YOU'RE SITTING DOWN -- A TO SUBCOMMITTEE THREE DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE. TO LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE. DURING SB NINE A ONE HEARINGS AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SPECIALLY TODAY'S. THANK YOU THANK YOU-- WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL -- WE HAVE -- TO TO INDIVIDUALS TOM PORTER WHO'S THE DIRECTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. GOVERNOR NEWSOME APPOINTED CHIEF PORTER AS DIRECTOR JUST COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- JANUARY EIGHTH BEFORE THAT HE WAS CHIEF OF STRATEGIC PLANNING AT CALIFORNIA HEADQUARTERS. SOUTHERN REGION CHIEF ASSISTANT RE. AND I USE ASSISTANT REGENCY FOR THE SOUTHERN REGION. MAYBE -- CORRECT ME ON THAT THAT'S THAT'S A MOUTHFUL -- BUT YOU ARE ALSO -- SAN DIEGO UNIT FIRE CHIEF CHIEF PORTERS DEPTH OF FIRE DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE IS BALANCED BY HIS FORESTRY BACKGROUND HE REALLY HAS A A BROAD BACKGROUND THAT'S APPLICABLE HERE. OF HIS A RESERVATION REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTER IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FORESTRY DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY GO BEARS -- AND WE HAVE ALSO WITH US DR JIM THORNE WHO IS A CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCHER AND MODELER AT UC DAVIS -- AND WHO HELPED NUMEROUS CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA TO DEVELOP FRAMEWORKS FOR ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS INCLUDES DEVELOPING MAPS TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ASSESS CLIMATE REST TO NATURAL LANDS HELPING CAL FIRE PROJECT WERE TREE SPECIES WILL MOVE. UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEVELOP FOR CALTRANS HE WAS THE AUTHOR AND EDITOR OF CALLIE PA'S CLIMATE INDICATORS REPORT. AND THE LEAD AUTHOR FOR THE SUMMARY OF THE RECENT FOURTH CLIMATE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND I WANT TO WELCOME YOU BOTH BEFORE YOU BEGIN -- I JUST WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT -- I HAVE A UNFORTUNATELY FAMILY EMERGENCY THAT I HAVE TO ATTEND TO TODAY AND I'LL BE LEAVING. AT APPROXIMATELY -- TEN TWENTY FIVE BUT IS FRIEDMAN WILL CARRY ON A MORE THAN CAPABLE THE IN MY ABSENCE PLEASE CHIEF. WELL THANK YOU AGAIN -- TOM PORTER A CAL FIRE DIRECTOR AND FIRE CHIEF -- CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND CHAIR FRIEDMAN THANK YOU FOR A FOR HAVING ME HERE AND AND US HERE FOR THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC -- AND REALLY LOOKING TOWARD TOWARD THE FUTURE A AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE -- WE'RE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED AND OTHER -- IN WATERSHED HEALTH AND WITH SO. I THINK YOU I WANTED TO START WITH -- A KIND OF I LAY OUT OF OF WILD FIRE IS A UBIQUITOUS PART OF CALIFORNIA -- EVERY ACRE IN CALIFORNIA CANNON WILL BURN AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. AND WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY JUST SEEING THAT THAT RATE AND THAT RETURN INTERVAL IS IS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY IN THE IN THE RECENT YEARS [inaudible] WE'VE SEEN. I DO TOO CLIMATE -- WILD SWINGS IN WEATHER PATTERNS LESS SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS -- LONGER -- AND MORE PERSISTENT DROUGHTS. MORE -- WIND EVENTS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL FIRE UNDER SANTANA'S. NORTHERN WINDS UP HERE IN THIS PART OF THE STATE AND SUNDOWNERS AND THE CENTRAL COAST. MORE OF THOSE DAYS ARE COMING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAN WE ARE ARE USED TO SEEING -- AND THEN THE BONE DRY FUELS. AND WE'VE THE PERSISTENT DROUGHT REALLY DRIED EVERYTHING TO BONE DRY. OF THE LARGE LOGS THAT ARE OUT IN THE FOREST THE TREES THE THE HUNDRED AND NOW FORTY SEVEN MILLION TREES THAT ARE DEAD IN THE FORESTS OF THE OF THE CENTRAL SIERRA. IT TAKES FOR THEM TO DRY OUT AND IT TAKES MORE YEARS FROM THE FOR THEM TO INCREASE IN MOISTURE AGAIN. SO THAT BONE DRY FUEL IS IS BECOMING VERY AVAILABLE AND MAKING A FIRE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN. A CLIMATE CHANGE HAS EXTENDED OUR FIRE SEASON. WE HAVE AN EARLIER START TO FIRE SEASON AND AT A LATER AND AND THAT'S THE PEAK SEASON AND WE'RE FINDING THAT WE HAVE WILDFIRE AND FIRE SEASON THAT'S CARRYING THROUGHOUT THE SEIZE THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE HAD A HUMBLE A FIRE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY THIRTY ACRES -- OVER THE THE A CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S HOLIDAY PERIOD -- THAT'S UNHEARD OF IN THE WETTEST PLACE IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER SO. WITH ALL OF THIS -- OF COURSE THE STATISTICS FROM THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SHOW THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS. AT THE TIME THE WORST FIRE. SEASON IN HISTORY FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S OF COURSE ARE ARE WRITTEN HISTORY -- WHEN WE'VE BEEN STE -- WORKING TO SUPPRESS FIRES AND AND SUCH. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAME AROUND AND DWARFED. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BROKE ALL RECORDS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WOULD COME TO A POINT WHERE -- FIREFIGHTERS THAT HAD THIRTY PLUS. YEAR LONG CAREERS -- AND RENDON THOSE CAREERS SOME TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO THEY TALKED ABOUT CAREER FIRES. WHEN I STARTED THE FIRE SERVICE IT WAS ALWAYS THIS CAREER FIRE CONCEPT CAREER FIRE THIS THE THE BIG? ONE YOU SEE EVERYBODY ON THAT WAS A FIRE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIFTY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES AND BURNED. MAYBE -- ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY STRUCTURES THAT WAS A CAREER FIRE. NOW WE'RE HAVING MULTIPLE CAREER FIRES EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND I CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT I'VE HEARD ANYBODY SAY. THAT'S A CAREER FIRE. WE DON'T EVEN USE IT IN THE FIRE SERVICE ANYMORE IT IS IT'S A RELIC. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY CONCERNING TO ME THE WATERSHED IMPACTS. SO ALL OF THIS COMES WITH GREAT IMPACTS. TO WATERSHED. AND WE STARTED OFF -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH THE TRAGIC EVENTS IN MINAS SETO -- THAT WERE ON THE HEELS OF THE OF THE THOMAS FIRE AT THE TIME THE LARGEST FIRE IN HISTORY -- AND THEN THEN THEN THE DEBRIS FLOWS. TO KILL PEOPLE DESTROYED HOMES AND BECAUSE A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AS WELL. WEARE SEEING ARE AND AND AND TO BE CLEAR WHAT THE STATE HAS RESPONDED TO THE LARGE FIRES IN THE LAST -- FIVE OR SO YEARS WITH -- WIRED WATER WATERSHED EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS THAT GO AND IT'S CAL FIRE AND ON THE CALIFORNIA -- GEOLOGIC SURVEY SURVEY WORKING TOGETHER -- AND OTHER AGENCIES TO DETERMINE WHAT CRITICAL AREAS ARE THAT THAT COULD SEE THE DAMAGE OR HIGH HIGH FLOW OF WATER DEBRIS FLOWS THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND OTHER DAMAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED FROM. THE FIRE ITSELF AND THEN AND THEN -- IDENTIFY THOSE AND IDENTIFY MITIGATION MEASURES WHERE WHERE POSSIBLE AND AND A FEASIBLE. AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT AND AND THOSE TEAMS HAVE THEY HAVE BECOME VERY CRITICAL TO OUR FIRE RESPONSE AND ARE WATERSHED EMERGENCY RESPONSE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS UTILIZE THOSE SAME TYPES OF TEAMS TO DETERMINE AHEAD OF AHEAD OF WILD FIRES WHERE THOSE AREAS ARE WE CAN DO THAT? WE CAN AND ARE DOING THAT IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE -- PROACTIVELY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE THE ISSUES MIGHT BE SHOULD WE HAVE WATER A FIRE IN THOSE AREAS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER MORE OF MOVING DOWN THE DOWN THE ROAD. IF YOU HAVEN'T. READ JOHN MAKE FEES SHORT STORY ON ON ON KIND OF WATER FLOW. AND THE SENATE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS. IN IN THE BOOK OR HIS BOOK. THE CONTROL OF NATURE. I WOULD ITS A SHORT PASSAGE IT'S AT THE BACK END OF THE BOOK AND IT'S WORTH THE READ BECAUSE IT'LL GIVE YOU A VERY VERY VIVID. PICTURE OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER FIRE WHEN WE HAVE THESE THESE -- COULD KIND OF RAIN ABOUTS THESE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS. SOMETHING JUST TO TO THINK ABOUT -- SO I THINK THE WITH THE WATERSHED A PIECE OF THIS -- KIND OF ADDING TO THE THE LONGEVITY OF OF THE DAMAGE THAT WILD FIRES ARE CAUSING -- ON THE LANDSCAPE. THE FINAL THING IT KIND OF COMES BACK TO THAT CAREER FIRE COMMENT THAT I MADE. WHILE THE WHILE THE WATERSHED AND THE LANDSCAPE IS IS BEING. DAMAGED BY THESE THESE FIRES. A AND THIS ACTIVITY. SO TO OUR OUR FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES ARE OUR HUMAN CAPITAL THAT GOES. TO RESPOND TO THESE EMERGENCIES ARE ARE REALLY SEEING. A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO THE THE NUMBER AND THE LONGEVITY THAT THEY'RE SPENDING ON INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AGAIN. NO LONGER IS THERE A CAREER FIRE. THERE IS JUST CAREER SEASONS AND IT JUST NEVER ENDS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT -- WE NEED TO FOCUS ON GOING FORWARD IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OF OUR OF OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACROSS THE BOARD AS LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE -- FLOOD EVERYTHING. INCLUDED. AND WITH THAT -- I WILL CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DIRECTOR. WELCOME. ARE THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT TO THE GROUP HERE. AND I'LL TRY AND ADD A FEW IMAGES. TO OF WHAT TOM JUST SO ELOQUENTLY. OF REPRESENTED AND I'M GONNA TRY AND FOCUS A LITTLE MORE ON THE WATER SIDE OF OUR WATER SHEDS AND THE WILDLIFE AND HABITAT COMPONENT. BUT THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO JUST. DO A LITTLE REVIEW. IF I CAN GET THESE THIS QUICKER TO WORK. SO THIS IS A SLIDE THAT'S ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD NOW BUT IT SHOWS TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE RED LINE THE TEMPERATURE IN CALIFORNIA'S BEEN GOING UP AND PRESET BOUNCES AROUND A LOT BUT WE HAD THE FOUR YEAR DROUGHT. THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY A TWO YEAR -- A DOUBLE NORMAL RAINFALL YEAR LAST YEAR OF WHICH I THINK PROBABLY GREW THE THATCH WHICH HELPED TO INMATE IGNITE MANY OF THE FIRES THAT ARE. YOU WERE JUST DESCRIBING. AND THEN I HAVE I HAVE A SERIES OF MAPS YOU'RE THE TO JUST KIND OF WALK THROUGH WHAT. ARE SOME OF THE PROJECTED FUTURES ARE AND I LIKE LOOKING TOWARDS THE END OF CENTURY BECAUSE THE THAT'S THE MOMENTUM. EVEN IF WE MANAGED TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS WE ARE STILL ON A TRACK WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF CHANGE OVER THE THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS OR SO. AND SO ON THE LEFT YOU SEE A ANNUAL MEAN MINIMUM TURNED OUT TO BE CRITICAL FOR MANY ECOSYSTEMS -- AND MANY THINGS IN AGRICULTURE AS WELL -- AND THEN IN THE CENTRAL PANEL THAT'S THE CHANGE INTO -- AND CENTURY UNDER A WETTER FUTURE AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CHANGE. TO THE END OF CENTURY UNDER A HOTTER FUTURE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT SOME PLACES ARE GOING TO BE. UNDER A PARTICULAR HAVE IF WE STAY ON THE HOTTER TRACK. OF LARGE PARTS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL BE NINE AND DEGREE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER ON NIGHT ON AVERAGE AT NIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S A PROJECTION THAT THE THAT'S ON THE BOOKS NOW RELATIVE -- TO THAT'S HOW MUCH WARMING WE COULD SEE IN SOME PARTS OF WHAT NINE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. I TRY TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO FAHRENHEIT AND MILES HERE. TO PRECIPITATION THERE'S ON THE LEFT THERE'S CALIFORNIA'S PRECEPT AND WE KNOW ALMOST NEVER HAVE AN AVERAGE YEAR RIGHT. BUT THAT'S SORT OF WHERE YOU SEE MORE OR LESS AND THEN UNDER A WETTER FUTURE IN THE CENTER YOU SEE A A A LITTLE BIT OF BLUE IN THERE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE RAIN -- AND UNDER A DRYER FUTURE BY THE TRYING DOWN AND ONE OF THE THINGS TO NOTICE THAT IN OUR WETTEST PART AS YOU. MENTIONED UP AROUND HUMBLE I WE SEE A LOT OF DRY DOWN UNDER UNDER ONE OF THESE. CIRCULATION MODELS THAT HAS RAIN NOT HITTING NORTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA AS DEEPLY. OKAY HERE'S RUNOFF OKAY WILL RUN OFF A IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT'S WHERE WE COLLECT THE WATER INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM THAT -- FUELS THE AGRICULTURE AND THE THE CITIES IN THE NURSES THE PEOPLE UP WATERS THE PEOPLE SHALL WE SAY. AND UNDER WHETHER FUTURE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE NOT SURPRISINGLY UNDER DRYER FUTURE. RUNOFF DECREASES OKAY WE EXPECT THAT RIGHT [inaudible] WELL OKAY. AS WE GO ALONG WE'RE GOING SEE MORE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS AND MORE DROUGHTS BECAUSE THINGS ARE GETTING FLASHIER AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE PULSE OF WATER MAY BE MUCH MORE INTENSE SO NOT ONLY WILL IT COME IN A SHORTER PERIOD AND OUR FIRE SEASON BE LONGER. BUT WE MAY SEE FLASH FLOODS OR WE MAY SEE PULSES IN WHICH THE OF RAINFALL THIS COMING IS COMING MORE INTENSELY ON TO THE LANDSCAPE. AND SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE WATER HOW DO WE MANAGE OUR WATER SHEDS. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY THE RESILIENCE TO HANDLE BOTH PULSE ADVANCE AND LONGER SEQUENCES OF DROUGHT. OKAY SNOW PACK WILL SNOW PACK WHETHER IT GETS WETTER OR DRYER OUR SNOW PACK IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE -- THIS CURRENT STORM NONE YOU KNOW REGRET IT REGARDLESS OF THIS CURRENT STORM -- AND SO YOU SEE HERE THAT BECAUSE TEMPERATURES ARE WARMING AND ONE OF THE NICKNAMES OF THIS YEAR'S IS THE MOTHER RANGE BECAUSE IT'S A RELATIVELY WARM MOUNTAIN RANGE IN. NORTH AMERICA -- THAT -- WILL SEE A DECREASE SO THERE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WETTER DRIER FUTURE AND WHAT OUR STORAGE OUR THIRD THIRD 30% OR SO OF OUR WATER BUDGET THE COMES AS SNOW. WILL BE. AND THEN HERE'S A A MEASURE OF PLANT STRESS SO THE CLIMATIC WATER DEFICIT AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW MUCH MORE WOULD PLANTS LIKE -- TO EVAPORATE TRANSFEREE IF THEY COULD -- IF THE WATER WAS AVAILABLE IN THE SOIL AND SO YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. YOU KNOW THE DESERT'S ARE REDDER AND THE THE NORTH WEST CORNER IS THE HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CLIMATIC WATER DEFICIT. AND AGAIN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER WE SEE MORE OR LESS RAIN OF PRECIPITATION. PLANTS ARE GOING TO BE UNDER HIGHER STRESS THAN THEY ARE NOW. FOR OUR FORESTS GRASSLANDS SCRUBLANDS THEY'RE ALL GOING TO EXPERIENCE HIGHER STRESS AND THAT'S BECAUSE TEMPERATURE IS RAMPING UP FASTER THAN A INCREASE IN WATER WOULD WOULD -- ALLOW FOR THEM TO KEEP UP WITH THIRTY VAPID TRANSPIRATION SO WE EXPECT TO SEE STRESS COMING INTO. OUR FORESTS MORE AND MORE AND TRIGGERING EVENTS LIKE DROUGHT COULD OCCUR. THEY MIGHT NOT THEY MIGHT NOT NEED THE SAME INTENSITY OF DROUGHT TO HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF A FACT IN TERMS OF MORTALITY ON TREES AND STRESS ON TREES THAT OPENS THE TREES UP. FOUR BEATLES AND OTHER -- PATHOGENS RIGHT. OKAY SO HERE'S SOME AN EXAMPLE THAT SOME FORCE CHANGES ALREADY HAPPENING THESE ARE -- BASED OFF OF NINETEEN THIRTY SURVEY THAT WAS DONE -- IN CALIFORNIA AND COMPARING THE MAP TO A CONTEMPORARY OF ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THERE'S ABOUT ABOUT A THREE HUNDRED FOOT TO TWO DEGREES. OF NIGHT TIME WANTING TO DATE THEIR RESPONSE TO THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A FIRE. MAYBE THOSE FEELINGS ARE NOT COMING BACK AND SO THIS STARTS TO LEAD US INTO WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE CHANGES IN COMPOSITION IN OUR OUR FORESTS AND SPECIES MAY BE A OF FORCE TREES MAY MOVE AROUND. AND THE MIX OF HARDWOODS TO CON OFFERS IN THIS YEAR'S OR THE LOCATIONS OF OUR BIG OAK SAVANNAS THE BLUE OAK WOODLANDS THAT RING THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- THOSE TYPES OF HABITATS MAY BEGIN -- TO CHANGE AND SO THEN THE QUESTION ARISES OF WHERE DO WE WHERE COULD WE RETAIN THEM. AND WHERE ARE EVER PLACES THAT. EVEN IF WE PUT ENORMOUS RESOURCES IT MIGHT NOT LOOK THE SAME FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW THAT IT LOOKS TODAY. AND HOW DO WE FIGURE THAT OUT AND THEN HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT FROM A WATERSHED PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR SOME VERY COMPELLING STORIES LATER IN THE DAY WITH REGARDS -- TO A DOCTOR NORSE AYE IDEAS OF MANAGING FORESTS AND MANAGING THE BLACK IN THE GREEN THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE REDUCE DEEP DEBRIS FLOWS AND GET IN THERE AFTER FIRES WE ALSO NEED TO MANAGE THE GREEN. AND WE NEED TO DO THOSE THINGS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SO I HAVE TO TOP SLIDE WITH SOME TEXT I APOLOGIZE WALK US THROUGH -- PACK WE LOSE OUR SNOW PACK MEADOWS ARE GOING TO BE THE LET THE NEXT SPONGES THAT COLD WATER ON THE LANDSCAPE WE WANNA HOLD WATER ON THE LANDSCAPE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. TO PREVENT IT THE THE INCREASED SPEED OF OF VELOCITY OF WATER MOVING THROUGH OUR SYSTEMS NOT BEING ABLE TO RETAIN IT FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE OR FOR ECOSYSTEM HEALTH. FOR HUMAN USES SO MEADOWS BECOME META RESTORATION BECOMES AN INTERESTING. OPPORTUNITY RIGHT CARRY IN AREAS OF GETTING INTO THE RIGHT PARIAN AREAS AND MAKING THEM MORE RESILIENT -- TO WITHSTAND DEBRIS FLOWS AND TO TO REDUCE EROSION BECAUSE EROSION COMING INTO OUR DAM INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE A LARGE PROBLEM SO HOW DO YOU -- WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OUR WATERSHEDS HOLISTICALLY BECAUSE OF ALL OF THESE PIECES CONTRIBUTE AND THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER WHILE THE HELL SLIPS THAT'S WHERE YOU MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT -- MANAGING OUR WOODLANDS WELCOME OTHER PLACES WE CAN PUT IN SHADED FUEL BREAKS OTHER PLACES -- WHEN WE LOOK AT RECOVERING OF FROM A YOUR TOWN RECOVERING LIKE LIKE A PARADISE? WHAT COULD WE DO ON THE LANDSCAPE THAT THAT BUILDS RESILIENCE INTO THAT WHOLE LANDSCAPE AND AND MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT LESS SUSCEPTIBLE AND ONE OF THE PLACES THAT YOU WANT TO GO FIRST TO DO THAT? IF YOU HAD HE GAVE ME A MILLION BUCKS AND SIT AND SAID OKAY GO OUT AND DO IT NOW WHAT PLACES WHEN I PICKED BECAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA GET A LITTLE TINY PART OF THE FORCE THAT FIRST YEAR ON THAT PERSONALLY. RIGHT OKAY SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MANAGING OUR WATER SHEDS. LOOKING AT THEM HOLISTICALLY -- IMPROVE THE WATER RETENTION ON THESE LANDSCAPES BECAUSE OF THE THE CLIMATE -- PRESSURES THAT ARE COMING. SO I THINK THAT'S MORE OR LESS WHAT'S ON THAT SLIDE. AND LET'S JUMP TO THE LATTER THE SECOND TO LAST. SO. HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO VEGETATION AND TWO SPECIES WELL CHANGES IN THE SPECIES MIX ARE COMING WILL WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE THAT IN DIFFERENT PLACES? ARE AND SPECIES ARE GOING TO MOVE TO TRY TO TRACK THEIR SUITABLE CLIMATES. THERE ARE THERE HOWEVER THERE ARE PLACES WHICH APPEAR TO BE MORE STABLE BY THE END OF CENTURY AND THAT AT THOSE MAY BE THE PLACES WHERE. IF YOU HAVE A DOG FOR FORCE NOW IT COULD STILL BE A DOG FOR FOR US BECAUSE THE GENERAL CONDITIONS ARE WITHIN THE RANGE THAT DOG. FOR OUR EXPERIENCE IS NOW AND OTHER PLACES WERE DUG FOR CURSES IT PROBABLY IS. GOING TO BE OUTSIDE OF THAT CLIMATE CONDITIONS. I AND THEN AND THOSE WOULD BE THE ZONES OF TRANSITION AND SO THE IF WE THINK OF THE LANDSCAPE IN TERMS OF WHERE THE REFUGIO WHERE THE PLACES WE WANT TO RETAIN. WHERE THE PLACES THAT WE EXPECT TO CHANGE AND MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE -- TO TO SEE THAT CHANGE TO TRY. TO THAT THE THOSE ARE -- IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS -- AND AND THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES. A AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO WILDLIFE SIMILARLY THERE ARE PLACES WHERE THE HABITATS THAT ARE [inaudible] ANIMALS. OCCUPY OUR WILD ARE WILDLIFE OCCUPIES OUR LOOK APPEAR TO BE CLIMATICALLY STABLE OVER THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS AND THERE'S OTHER PLACES WHERE -- THOSE SIMILARLY I MEANS THE VEGETATION IS THE HABITAT OF WE EXPECT THOSE PLACES TO CHANGE AND SO THEY MIGHT NOT BE SUITABLE FOR SOME SPECIES. AND SO CORRIDORS AND CONNECTIVITY LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR WHAT ARE THE PLACES THAT YOU WANTED RETAIN IN SOME KIND OF NATURAL CONDITION. SO THAT SPECIES CAN MOVE FROM WHERE THEY CURRENTLY CAN PERSIST. TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PERSIST IN THE FUTURE. THESE ARE A VERY ACTIVE RESEARCH TOPICS AND THEY WERE ADDRESSED IN THE FOURTH CLIMATE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT TO SOME DEGREE THEY ARE CAL FIRE HAS HAD AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THESE TYPES OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS SIMILARLY SO I THINK THE AGENCIES ARE ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES. AND I'VE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TRY TO PRESENT THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I WONDER IF YOU COULD GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT -- HOW AND PERHAPS BOTH OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A CRACK AT THIS QUESTION HOW WORK CURRENTLY PRIORITIZING THAT TED? RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE -- GIVEN THE FACT THAT EVEN WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- OF THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE STILL. ARE LIMITATIONS. AS DOES THE QUESTION -- IS RELATED TO MANAGEMENT I'LL TAKE THAT FIRST. FLEAS AND SO -- WHAT WHAT CAL FIRE IS DOING IS IS -- THROUGH THE FUNDING THAT THAT HAS COME THROUGH -- GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDING. AND OTHER -- MECHANISMS -- WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF THAT TO WORKING DIRECTLY INTO -- WATERSHED BASS LANDSCAPE LEVEL RESILIENCE WORK -- SO -- I'LL AND I'LL COME BACK TO IT BUT THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN EXPENDED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- COMING GOING FORWARD WE HAVE -- TWO HUNDRED MILLION -- FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO TOTAL OF AN ADDITIONAL BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF INVESTMENT IN THIS TYPE OF OF LANDSCAPE LEVEL. OF FOREST WORK. AND BECAUSE SOME OF THAT WILL BE FOCUSED IN IN IN AND AROUND COMMUNITIES BUT BY AND LARGE THE THE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE OUT IN THE IN THE BROADER LANDSCAPE WATERSHED RELATED. AND LOOKING TO ESTABLISH -- PRIORITIES -- THAT THAT. ACT AS ANCHOR POINTS AND THEN MORE WORK -- EXPANDS FROM. ALL OF OUR EFFORTS IN -- IT DEVELOPING OUR GRANT PROGRAMS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- AND HAVE HAVE BEEN TO THAT AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING COMPETITIVE GRANTS WE ALSO HAVE DONE BEEN DOING DIRECT FUNDING -- WE WILL CONTINUE AND DO MORE CORRECT SURE -- BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW IDENTIFIED WHERE THOSE ANCHOR POINTS ARE WE KNOW WE NEED TO PUT -- PROJECT WORK AND AND MONEY INTO THOSE AREAS TO ESTABLISH A REALLY GOOD FOOTHOLD TO THEN SPREAD FROM. ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE COORDINATED WITH OUR FOR SERVICE -- COUNTERPARTS REGION FIVE FOR SERVICE -- SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PROJECTS -- WE HAVE ARE PROJECTS WE PUT OUR MAPS TOGETHER WE WE INVITE IN THIS YEAR PROJECT PACIFIC INDUSTRIES AND OTHER TIMBER COMPANIES ALSO WHO SHOW US WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- BOTH IN THEIR TIMBER HARVESTING PLANNING -- THEIR THINNING AND THEIR FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE COMING TO THE TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE ANCHOR POINTS THAT WE CAN THEN STE. SPREAD THAT WORK OUT FROM AND REALLY HAVE. BROAD LANDSCAPE LEVEL WATERSHED. AND FORCED RESILIENCE -- AFFECT [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU I THINK YOU COVERED IT REALLY WELL. GREAT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND THOSE WERE BOTH REALLY EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU -- I WAS PARTICULARLY INTRIGUED WITH THE NOTION OF TRYING TO PUT OUR RESOURCES INTO. THE AREAS THAT WE THINK ARE GOING -- TO CHANGE THE LEASE -- THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO TO THINK ABOUT -- FOCUSING AND PRIORITIZING I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE CHIEF OF FIRST OF ALL HOW DOES CALL FIRE DECIDE -- TO A PORTION THE G. G. R. F.. APPROPRIATIONS BETWEEN THE LOCAL FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS AND FOREST HEALTH GRANTS DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF FORMULA THAT YOU USE OR HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE SORTS OF DECISIONS THAT THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION -- AND WILL WE WE DON'T PRE DETERMINED HOW MUCH IS GOING TO GO -- TO THE LOCAL -- VERSUS THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL -- WE BRING IN APPLICATIONS -- FROM BOTH A AND THIS IS IN THE COMPETITIVE ROUND. SO -- WHEN WE'RE DOING THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS WE WE WE BRING IN FRONT THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT TWO SEPARATE PROCESSES LANDSCAPE LEVEL AND THEN MORE OF THE COMMUNITY BASED? AND THEN WE WE PRIORITIZE THOSE -- FROM TOP TO BOTTOM -- IT AND THEN WE DETERMINE BASED ON THE QUALITY OF APPLICATION AND THE QUALITY OF OF PROJECT -- AS DETERMINED BY SCREENING AT THE LEVEL. THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND THEN ALSO THE SACRAMENTO LEVEL. WE DETERMINE WHICH WHICH WHICH ONES WHERE THE KIND OF THE BREAK OFF POINT IS IN IN THE THE BEST OF THE BEST. AND IN BOTH CATEGORIES AND THEN WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IT'S IT'S BROKEN ALMOST EVENLY -- THEIR SPEND ABOUT FIFTY TO ADD A LITTLE BIT LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL AND THEN THE OTHER IN IN THE KIND OF AROUND COMMUNITIES BUT IT'S STILL A FOREST'S TREATMENT IT'S NOT IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE CLOSER -- TO TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING. IN THOSE -- PREVENTION TYPE OF OF GRANTS -- IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT -- NOT A FORTY THAT HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE EXPANDED SUSS THUS FAR OR IS OBLIGATED THUS FAR -- IT HAS GONE ON TO FEDERAL LANDS IN THOSE FEDERAL LANDS WHILE THEY ARE NEAR COMMUNITIES THEY ARE THEY ARE MORE OF THAT LANDSCAPE LEVEL -- PROJECT WORK. GREAT THANK YOU AND WONDERED IF YOU COULD JUST TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW ANY OF YOUR FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS AND IF YOU'VE SEEN ANY TANGIBLE BENEFITS AT THIS POINT AND WHAT THOSE WOULD BE. ABSOLUTELY -- UP THE HIGHWAY FIFTY CORRIDOR -- WE HAVE HAD BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF EFFORT -- BOTH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AND CAL FIRE -- AND OTHER LOCAL -- LOCALS HAVE ALSO BEEN PUTTING MONEY INTO PROJECTS. TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES AND THE CORRIDOR ALONG A HIGHWAY FIFTY IT'S THAT'S ONE OF THOSE ANCHOR POINTS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND WHILE THERE'S THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT -- POPULATION THAT'S THAT'S IN THE THE LITTLE COMMUNITIES ALONG HIGHWAY -- FIFTY A LOT OF THAT IS COMBINATION -- FIRE PREVENTION AND LANDSCAPE LEVEL TREATMENT WORK THAT WE'RE DOING SO THAT'S THAT'S AN EXAMPLE A DINKY CREEK WHICH IS A COLLABORATIVE DOWN AND YOUR SHAVER LAKE IN FRESNO COUNTY -- THAT IS A COLLABORATIVE WITH THE FOR SERVICE THAT WE'RE DOING UNDER A GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY -- AND THEN THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL THESE ARE THE AREAS WHERE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SEEING ANCHOR POINTS THAT WE CAN REALLY. COME TOGETHER -- AS MULTIPLE AGENCIES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AND AND ESTABLISH A PLACE TO WORK OUT FROM. THANK YOU. MEN CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW WATERSHED RESTORATION AND FUEL REDUCTION ACTIVITIES OVERLAP OR ARE DIFFERENT. AND ALSO IN YOUR OPINION IF YOU THINK HOW FIRES THE BEST AGENCY TO REALLY BE EVALUATING AND DIRECTING THE WATERSHED EFFORTS. A GREAT QUESTIONS AND WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY -- TO FUELS AND WATERSHED ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE LINKED -- THIS IS ALL A SYSTEM. AND FUEL REDUCTION IS PART OF THE THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO MANAGING WATERSHEDS. AS WELL AND SO -- I VERY CLEAR NEXUS THERE -- RELATED -- TO CAL FIRE BEING THE BEST FOR WATERSHED MANAGEMENT I WOULD SAY IN FORESTRY YES. YES. OF ON THE PRIVATE LANDS -- I WOULD SAY THERE'S MORE TO WATERSHED MANAGEMENT THAN FORESTRY -- AND TO THAT END -- WE ARE WE ARE A PART OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. AND WE HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH -- WITH -- OTHER AGENCY DEPARTMENTS ON ON LOOKING AT OUR OUR AND AND HELPING US REVIEW OUR APPLICANTS ESPECIALLY ON THAT WITH THAT WATERSHED LEVEL PROJECT. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND AND GROW. GREAT AND LASTLY YOU HAVE A GOAL I BELIEVE OF SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES FOR FIRE THREAT REDUCTION TREATMENT -- WHERE ARE YOU ARE YOU ON TRACK FOR THAT AND KIND OF WHERE WHERE ARE YOU? WE WE ARE ON TRACK -- THE EARLY RAIN SLOWED SOME OF OUR WELL THE THE LATE FIRES AND EARLY RAIN SLOWED SOME OF OUR PRESCRIBED BURNING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO CATCH UP ON THAT. BUT WE WE ARE -- ALMOST AT 40% OF OUR OF OUR CUMULATIVE -- GOAL SPRINGS COMING AND WILL WILL BE PICKING UP IT'S IT'S IT'S A FISCAL YEAR GOAL SO WE WE WE AREN'T ON A CALENDAR YEAR FOR THAT FOR THE FUELS TREATMENT. THAN THE FUELS TREATMENT IS -- BOTH PRESCRIBED BURNING OF AND OTHER TYPES OF OF TREATMENT SO THAT BE MECHANICAL OR HAND CUTTING PILING BURNING THOSE KIND OF THINGS -- ALL WOULD BE IN THE OTHER AND WE HAVE A WE HAVE A STATEWIDE GOAL THIS YEAR OF TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THE OTHER TYPE OF FUELS TREATMENT. AND FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY FIVE WHICH IS NOT THE SIXTY BUT THAT'S WE'RE SIXTY IS ARE ARE PROJECTED GOAL IN THE FUTURE. THIS YEAR WE HAVE A FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRE. GOAL AND AND WE'RE ABOUT 40% OF THE WAY THERE WERE WORKING TOWARD. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS MR STONE. THANK YOU PROFESSOR ITCHING YOU YOU MENTIONED THE PONDEROSA PINES AND I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THEM IN THE SIERRA. BUT ON THE IN THE COASTAL AREAS ON THE THE AGING COASTAL MARINE TERRACES THAT ARE THEIR PONDEROUS IS ARE SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE SAND HILLS HABITAT AND THAT'S A HABITAT THAT'S DESIGNED TO BURN. IN ORDER TO PERPETUATE AND TO SURVIVE IT HASN'T BAD BECAUSE IT'S ALSO AN AREA UNDER TRUMP. MEDICINE DEVELOPMENT PRESSURE AND SO BEING ABLE TO MANAGE IT THE WAY THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED BECOMES A CHALLENGE. WHICH IS WHY LOOKING AT THE THE NATURE THE FORCED YOU BROUGHT UP IN THE NATURE THAT THE FORCE MAY END UP BEING AND BY YOUR SLIDES. ARE FORCED TO REALLY STRUGGLING BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. IN HOW WE MANAGE FORESTS OR DIDN'T MANAGE FORESTS. AND IF WE'RE LOOKING. TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE DO FORCE TREATMENTS NOW. WHICH IS YES FUEL REDUCTION BUT IT'S ALSO GETTING THE FORCE TO FUNCTION AS FORCED USED TO SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE BIRDS THAT THEY CAN MANAGE BECAUSE WHEN WE CLEAR CUT WHEN WE RE PLANTED HIGHER DENSITIES OR WITH THE WRONG TYPE TO TREES OR THE WRONG TYPES OF MANAGEMENT. THAN WERE JUST GROWING TREES TO GROW TREES BUT NOT CREATING FUNCTIONAL FORESTS. SO HOW DO WE TAKE. OR GUESS WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE OF THAT AS WE'RE DOING FORCED RESTORATIONS NOW. AND LOOKING AT FUTURE IMPACTS. TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY YEARS DOWN THE LINE WHEN THE SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO FUNCTION BECAUSE THE WORK THAT NOW IS GOING TO WORK OVERTIME. HOW DO WE HAVE A SENSE THAT THOSE RESTORATIONS THE WORK WE'RE DOING TO PROTECT WATERSHEDS TO MANAGE FORESTS NOW? THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS BECAUSE OF HOW THOSE FORCE MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. TO HELP. AND WE DEVELOPED ANY THOUGHTS ON ABILITY TO PREDICT. HOW MUCH TIME ARE YOU GETTING THE? THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S AN AREA OF VERY ACTIVE INTEREST AND WELL. POINTING TO THE SAND HILLS I CAN'T RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THAT WITHOUT LOOKING AT MAPS AND GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE ORIENTATION. GENERALLY SPEAKING OF FORESTRY HAS USED SEEDS OWNS ARE AS WE WHICH ARE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND FOOT BY ONE HUNDRED MILE BLOBS ON A MAP THAT WERE ORIGINALLY DRAWN IN NINETEEN FORTY IN THE MOST RECENT VERSION IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY AND THE IDEA IS. THE THE SEEDS THAT WE MIGHT PLANT I MEAN THERE THERE THERE THERE COULD BE A BOTTLENECK WHERE WE WE DON'T HAVE SEATS OKAY SO WE THE ASSUMPTION IS -- YEAH WE CAN GO ON WE COULD DO PLANTINGS WELL THE WAY THAT THAT OPERATION WORKS IS THERE ARE. OF A THERE'S A NURSERY THE LA MORAN NURSERY CAL FIRES OF ACTIVATING IN DAVIS THAT HAS A OF FROZEN BROOM WITH. THOUSANDS OF BOXES OF SEEDS IN IT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE AT THE INSTITUTE FOR FORCED GENETICS UP IMPOSSIBILITY FOR SERVICE THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG ONES THERE'S A NUMBER OF OF PRIVATE INDUSTRY ONES AS WELL. BUT PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT THE SEEDS GO OUT INTO AND AND THEY GET THE PINE CONES THEY BRING THEM IN AND THOSE ARE RECORDED. IN A A RATHER. OLD SYSTEM OF ITS IN THIS SEEDS OUT. AND PLANTING WITH A TAKING THOSE SEEDS AND PLANTING THEM AGAIN IN THE SAME SEATS OWN IS WHAT IS NOW. LOOKED AT BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WELL IF YOU HAD. A BIG FIRE IN THE MIDDLE ELEVATION AND YOU WERE GOING -- TO TRY TO GROW PONDEROSA IS THERE YOU MIGHT WANT PONDEROSA SEED FROM LOWER ELEVATIONS AND PLANTED AT MIT ELEVATION IN ANTICIPATION OF BECAUSE THOSE GUYS WERE EXPOSED TO WARMER CONDITIONS. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO ANTICIPATE THAT'S ONE THE OTHER THE OTHER PIECES THAT WE MIGHT CHANGE THE MIX SO THE THAT. I'M CONVINCED THAT IN THIS YEAR AS THERE'S PARTS OF IT THAT ARE BECOMING MORE HARDWOOD DOMINATED. AND SO PERHAPS THEN -- NOT ONLY GOING BACK IN PLANTING THE MOST. OF WHAT LOVING CHURCH -- CONNOR FOR TREES BUT HAVING A A FEW MORE HARDWOODS IN NOW TO RECOGNIZING THE HEART WHICH MAY COME INTO THEIR AS A NATURAL TRANSITION. AND MAY BE CHANGING YOUR SEATS STOCK MIX AS YOU'RE GOING IN TO DO A RESTORATION OF THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF ANTICIPATORY. PLANTINGS THE THE MOST RADICAL ONES -- IN WHICH ARE MORE ACADEMIC THAN THAN -- REAL ARE -- WHAT -- WE SERPENTINE AS OUR STATE ROCK AND WE HAVE MAYBE. 25% OF ALL OF OUR ENDEMICS OF OVER A THOUSAND SPECIES LIVE ON SERPENTINE WELL THOSE ARE LITTLE ISLANDS OF UNUSUAL -- CONDITIONS RIGHT AND ARE THE PLANTS THAT GROW ON THIS ONE LITTLE ONE THAT'S OVER IN THE BAY AREA GOING TO BE ABLE TO MIGRATE TO SOME OTHER PLACE. WE DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE PICKED THE SEEDS ARE GONNA BE PLANTED IN THAT OTHER PLACE AND THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE. IF THAT'S IS A RAGING DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S GOOD OR BAD WE MOVE SPECIES AROUND THE GLOBE. ALL THE TIME THAT'S THE REALITY BUT OF I WOULD SAY THOSE ARE THAT THAT'S SORT OF WHERE THE STATE OF THE SCIENCES NOW IS. I KNOW IT EITHER AND THAT'S YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS BECAUSE IF WE'RE WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE FORCED GROW SLOWLY. AND OF WAS WERE MAKING RESTORATION DECISIONS NOW WE'RE GONNA BE END UP IN FOREST'S IN THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS THAT MAY NOT BE FUNCTIONING BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE CHANGES. I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE MECHANISMS TO LOOK AHEAD AT WHAT WE EXPECT THOSE FORCED TO FUNCTION OR HOW THEY EXPECT THEM TO FUNCTION. IN THAT CHANGED ENVIRONMENTS. AS WE DO RESTORATIONS NOW OR WE'RE GOING TO AND REALLY UNITED THE AND SAYING AND AND HAVING SIMILAR KINDS OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THE ABILITY THE FORCE OF FUNCTIONS FORCE. IT IS CAL FIRE YOUR SHOE DIVISION. AS YOU DO RESTORATIONS ARE YOU ARE YOU STARTING TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE CONNECTIONS I I'M I'M GLAD YOU ASKED BECAUSE SOME -- IT AND THE SIDE -- THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AT A DIFFERENT WAY WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT REFORESTATION. OF OF INSURING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE FORCE THAT COMES FROM THAT ACTIVITY WE DON'T WANNA JUST PLANT TREES FOR THEM TO DIE -- BECAUSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN THEIR CLIMATE THEIR MICRO CLIMATE WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE SO -- WE DID IT. OVER A YEAR AGO NOW TO START A WHOLE PROCESS OF REDEFINING WHAT ARE SEEDS ZONES ARE AND WHAT THEY NEED TO BE. BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE SEA THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND DETERMINING WHAT THE BEST PLATE LIKELY. MIGRATION OF WHERE THAT SEED GOES BACK ON TO THE LANDSCAPE SHOULD BE SO SO ARE PLANTING GUIDES. AND OR OR PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THAT AT THE LA AROUND -- RESEARCH AND SEED SEED BANK AND NURSERY -- ARE WORKING TOWARD THAT -- AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DOES THAT IS THE WAY WE WILL BE -- REENTER INTRODUCING THE OVER OVER THE LAST DECADES BACK INTO THE LANDSCAPE -- GOING FORWARD THEY WILL BE GOING. NOT TO WHERE THE MOTHER TREES CAME FROM THEY WILL PROBABLY BE GOING UP SLOPE. AND PROBABLY FURTHER NORTH YEAH. OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. EGGMAN. THANK YOU CHIEF -- ONE OF THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT IT IS THE THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND THE DIRECT FUNDING TO ANCHOR POINTS ARE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. SO IT ISN'T JUST THOSE WHO HIRE THE BEST GRANT WRITERS -- WHO GET THE GRANTS BUT LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE TAKING ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY APPRECIATE THAT -- GIVEN THE FREQUENCY AND THE INTENSELY THE MOST RECENT FIRES. HOW MANY FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS? WORKING AT BIG COMPLETED EACH YEAR. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S A MOVING TARGET EACH ONE OF OUR UNITS WE HAVE TWENTY ONE UNITS PLUS WE HAVE -- SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES SO IN IN EACH OF THOSE -- TWENTY SEVEN AND ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS -- THEY HAVE A FIRE PLAN -- AND IT'S A CERTIFIED PLAN AND AND IT HAS A NUMBER OF PROJECTS SOME SOME TIMES -- THE PROJECTS ARE -- SCATTERED SO WE COULD BE DOING -- IN SOME AREAS. OR IN SOME COUNTIES OR MULTIPLE COUNTIES YOU MAY HAVE THIRTY PROJECTS THEY GET DONE IN A YEAR IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT -- OTHERS MIGHT HAVE JUST ONE OR TWO BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND MORE COMPLEX PROJECTS THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON SO. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT GETS DONE -- IS IS KIND OF IT CHANGES VERY DRASTICALLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR -- THE ACREAGE THAT THAT WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY -- THAT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND THEY WERE TRYING TO GET TO THIS YEAR THAT'S ENCOMPASSING ALL THOSE PROJECTS AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IS FOR A A MAN A MEASURE IS IS TO TRY AND UTILIZE THE ACREAGE THAT IS BEING TREATED. AND THEN USE THE THE FORCE CARBON PLAN AS OUR GUIDING DOCUMENT TO TO IDENTIFY WHAT CAL FIRES. AND OUR CAPACITY WHAT CAL FIRES -- TARGET IS IN THE KERR'S ANNUALLY -- OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE -- IN IN ALL. TYPES OF TREATMENT THAT WOULD BE CAL FIRE PRIVATE AND AND OTHER LOCAL -- AND THEN THE FOR SERVICE IS ALSO TRYING TO GET TO A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE NUMBER. FOR A TOTAL OF A MILLION ACRES ACROSS THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE OF CALIFORNIA -- SOMETIME IN THE NEXT DECADE. WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST HINDRANCES TO COMPLETING THE COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION PROJECTS? COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION PROJECTS -- MOST OFTEN COVER. MANY MANY SMALL LANDOWNERS AND GETTING BY AND FROM ALL OF THE LANDOWNERS -- IS ONE OF THE BIG HINDRANCES. ANOTHER ONE THAT SLOWS PROJECTS BUT DOESN'T KICKING I KEEP THEM FROM BEING DONE IS IS THE SEQUEL PROCESS SO WE WE DO HAVE A SEQUEL PROCESS THAT. THAT TAKES IN SOME CASES -- TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO COMPLETE -- AND IT SLOWS IMPLEMENTATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WE DON'T GET TO THOSE PROJECTS BUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THOSE -- AND THEN SMALL LANDOWNERS THAT ARE SKEPTICAL -- IN SOME CASES OF SEE CgA AND AND SKEPTICAL OF WANTING GOVERNMENT -- ENTERING ONTO THEIR LAND -- AND THE SCRUTINY THAT COMES WITH THAT THAT THAT IS A LOCAL -- CONCERN THAT WE THAT WE RUN INTO AROUND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE TRY AND DO THESE THESE -- FIRE PREVENTION TYPE OF ACTIVITIES AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MS EGGMAN. THANK YOU IN. AND AND AND I'M GONNA ASK A QUESTION I NEED TO LEAVE BEFORE TOO LONG AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES -- THINK MY COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE PRESSING MOST FASTENED QUESTION OF THE DAY. SO I WAS GONNA ASK -- ABOUT THE SMALL. THE SMALL PROJECTS -- THE SMALL LANDOWNERS SO JUST UP IN THE WOODS I'VE SEEN A WHOLE LOT OF STOCKTON TIMBER -- SO THAT WAS GONNA BE MY QUESTION -- LONG LINES OF MISS REYES HOW HOW WE WORKING TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL THAT TIMBER OUT ARE YOU GOT A LOT OF PLANS OUT THERE AND THEN A LOT OF SMALL LANDOWNERS AND SO YOU'VE GOT. MULTIPLE SYSTEMS WORKING AT THE SAME TIME DO WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO GET THE TIMBER OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE SO IT'S NOT JUST PILED UP. AND THEN ALONG THE LINES OF MISTER STONE. ALSO WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW SEEDS SPREAD. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE IMPACT ON THE ANIMAL POPULATION THAT IS ALSO THE BIRDS AND THE SQUIRRELS AND THE INSECTS THAT SPREAD THE SEEDS -- AND ALSO OUR OUR THE WILDLIFE LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT LOOKED A DECADE AGO IN PARTS OF THE SIERRA -- ARE WE LOOKING AT THAT AND TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE MAKE OUR PLANTS. BOTH VERY GOOD QUESTIONS ARE TAKING THE FIRST QUESTION ON ON SMALL LANDOWNERS THAT HAVE AN ACCUMULATION OF OF LOGS AND DIFFERENT THINGS -- THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I I JUST WANT TO QUALIFY THIS -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE THE AREA THAT IS REQUIRED FOR A LANDOWNER TO CLEAR AROUND THERE. STRUCTURE THERE HABITABLE STRUCTURE THAT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY -- AND SO THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE THERE'S DISADVANTAGED -- GRANT A CAPABILITIES STATE TO HELP WITH SOME OF THOSE COSTS BUT IT REALLY IS THE THE LANDOWNERS RESPONSIBILITY WHEN WE GET INTO KIND OF THE THE THE NEXT. TIER OF THAT OUTSIDE OF THAT DESPITE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WE HAVE ACCUMULATION OF WOODY MATERIAL WHETHER IT'S STILL STANDING OR OR CUT AND AND ON THE GROUND -- WITH THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOOKING FOR FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH WITH GROUPS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN DEALING WITH THAT ON THOSE FIRE PREVENTION TYPE OF GRANT OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE -- THEY'VE BEEN USED IN THE PAST FOR CHIPPING PROGRAMS AND OTHER -- IN SOME CASES -- SUBSIDIZING THE THE TRANSPORTATION OF CERTAIN MATERIALS TO BIOMASS PLANTS AND OR OTHER TYPES OF OF UTILIZING PLANTS -- BUT THAT IS IS THAT IS THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE FOR US AND THIS THAT SMALL LANDOWNER PIECES WHERE WE FEEL CAL FIRE FEELS THAT WITH THAT. WE HAVE THE GREATEST NEED AND PROBABLY THETHE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE -- TO TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO -- IN IN MOVING TO THAT LARGER NUMBER OF OF ACRES TREATED AND ON ON THE ANIMAL POPULATION I AM. I DO WANT TO KICK THIS TO JIM I DON'T WANT -- TO SURE COULD THE THE THAT I DON'T I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THE CAL FIRE DOESN'T THINK OF THIS BUT THIS IS ANOTHER -- LANDOWNER AND LAND MANAGER DECISION -- AND WE AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT WITH LANDOWNERS. ABOUT THE VALUE OF DIFFERENT TREES FOR MAST OR FOR FEED -- FOR BIRDS OR OR DIFFERENT THINGS -- AND SO WE WE DO TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE'RE HAVING -- KIND OF FORESTRY DISCUSSION WITH A LANDOWNER AND WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD BUT RELATED TO SPECIFICS I THINK I MAKE THAT TO JIM [inaudible] OKAY OF WHEN YOU HAVE A REALLY BIG WILD FIRE. IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT THE LOCAL SEED SOURCES. AND THE BIRDS THAT MIGHT BRING THEM ARE GOING TO RE VEGETATE THAT AREA. ARE AND THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES -- THERE WAS A BIG ONE ON THE RIM FIRE WHERE THEY WERE LOOKING AT A A WOODPECKER AND AND SAYING HOW MANY. WOULD YOU HAVE IN HERE AND YOU WOULD THEY BE BRINGING IN ACORNS OR WHATEVER AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT WE NEED TO ACTIVELY MANAGE WE'RE NOT GOING. TO JUST BE ABLE TO ALLOW THOSE AREAS TO NATURALLY REGENERATE OF THE THE RISK -- FOR TO AT THE VERY LEAST THE RISK FOR DEBRIS FLOWS IS VERY HIGH FROM THOSE AND SO YOU YOU NEED TO GET IN THERE AND DO SOMETHING. SO -- IN TERMS I I THINK THAT'S MAYBE MORE OF A MOTIVATION FOR ACTIVE RESTORATION. IN TERMS OF MONITORING THE POPULATIONS OF SPECIES. YOU KNOW I THINK THE I HAVEN'T HEARD OF SORT OF FOLLOW ON STUDIES WE KNOW WHAT A LOT OF THE SPECIES DO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS. REALLY QUITE VERSED IN THE INDIVIDUAL SPECIES FOR EXAMPLE MANY DEER POPULATIONS MIGRATE UP AND DOWN THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN -- JUST LIKE THAT OF AMERICANS USED TO DO. AT AND SO -- WE WE KNOW WHAT A LOT OF THE THAT SORT OF THE NATURAL TRAJECTORIES ARE MAINTAINING CONNECTIVITY ON THE LANDSCAPE. AND WHICH IS. DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING FROM FOREST SERVICE TO PRIVATE LAND TO MAYBE TO YOU A RIVER CORRIDOR THAT'S GOT SOME OTHER JURISDICTION -- BUT YOU WANT TO TRY TO RETAIN SOME NATURAL VEGETATION ACROSS THAT. ALL ALONG THAT CORRIDOR THAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE WIDELY POINTED TO FOR A CLIMATE CHANGE THAT. WOULD ALLOW FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOW PLANTS AND ANIMALS THEMSELVES TO HANDLE SOME OF THE MOVEMENT NEEDS THAT THEY MIGHT MIGHT REQUIRE. THANK YOU. FOR I WANTED TO WELCOME SOME MEMBERS AMOUNT AS TO THE HEARING -- MISTER TO YOU DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANYBODY ELSE. THANK YOU WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL THIS WAS A VERY. INTERESTING EDUCATIONAL PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. AND I'M GONNA WELCOME OUR SECOND PANEL UP -- THANK YOU OUR SECOND PANEL WILL FOCUS ON SOME OF THE MAIN G. G. R. F. AND GRANT PROGRAMS THE STATE IS CURRENTLY USING TO ADDRESS. A FIRE RISK RESTORE FIRE -- FOREST CHANGE IN ADDITION TO AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS -- WE ARE PARTICULARLY I'M HURT I MEAN IT JUST TRANSMIT TO THE PANEL RIGHT NOW THAT I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN WHETHER THERE'S ANY IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EFFECT EFFICIENT EXECUTION OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP ADDRESS. HOW WE'RE COORDINATING BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND IF WE NEED TO DO MOVE FASTER AND DO MORE IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE CLIMATE? DO WE NEED TO RETHINK HOW WE IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS I'M GOING TO IN TO BRIEFLY INTRODUCE THE PANEL AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO SPEAK IN THIS ORDER. RACHEL ELLERS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ANY CHIANG DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE A. R. B.. ANGELA LOTS ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTR FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY FROM CAL FIRE. ANGELA AVERY THE NEW EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THIS YEAR NEVADA CONSERVANCY.-JOHN DONNELLY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. AND HE'LL LEAVE A BRIGHT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION -- BUT WHO INTEL RECENTLY WAS THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF CLIMATE AND ENERGY AT THE NATIONAL RESOURCES AGENCY WELCOME. WITH THAT WE WERE ASKED MISS -- HERS TO BEGIN THANK YOU GOOD MORNING RACHEL EHLERS WITH ALLEGE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT WHICH HOPEFULLY -- YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF FROM THE SERGEANT AND IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE FOR THOSE NOT SITTING HERE -- THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF AKRON IN HERE WHICH I WILL PUT I'M TIME AND EXPERTISE YOU HAVE IN YOUR PANEL BUT FEEL FREE TO HOLLER AT ME IF I SHOULD SLOW DOWN. I AM SPEAKING I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK ON A REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED LAST APRIL ON IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S WITHOUT FORCING WATERSHED MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS A REPORT WE PUBLISHED ONLINE IN NOVEMBER ABOUT HOW CAL FIRE IS SPENDING RECENT -- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS FOR FOREST HEALTH. SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT AGAIN THIS IS JUST BACKGROUND OUR FORESTS ARE IMPORTANT AND THERE AN UNHEALTHY CONDITION I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT ALREADY TODAY. I THIS IS ONE POLICY AREA THAT YOU ARE FACING THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS A PRETTY BROAD CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE AREAS THAT THAT YOU ARE FACED WITH AN CHALLENGES YOU'RE FACED WITH. DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE AREAS BUT THERE IS A PRETTY BROAD CONSENSUS ABOUT THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT WILL YIELD PROGRESS IN THIS AREA. I THINK THAT THE FIGURE HERE ON PAGE ONE SHOWS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING YOU CAN SEE THE STATE'S SHARE OF OWNERSHIP OF THE STATE'S OF FORCE ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS QUITE SMALL -- SO THAT PRESENTS CHALLENGES BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITIES THE STATE CAN'T GO IN AND FIX THE PROBLEM ALL BY ITSELF EVEN IF IT WANTED TO IT TAKES A LOT OF COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM THAT -- ARE ON THE PANEL THAT WE NECESSARILY NEED TO BE WORKING WITH OTHER PARTNERS AND IN PARTICULAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVEN THEIR LARGE SHARE OF OWNERSHIP HERE. TURNING TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT JUST A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE BENEFITS OF HEALTHY FORESTS AND THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF UNHEALTHY FOREST'S -- WILD FIRES RESILIENCE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEN WATER SUPPLY WHICH I'M -- I THINK YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT EVEN MORE IN THE THIRD PANEL TODAY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS REALLY DIVED INTO THIS ISSUE IN RECENT YEARS IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON WELFARE AND WELFARE RISK BUT PROBABLY NOT QUITE AS MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT -- THE WATER ASPECT OF OUR FORESTS AND AND BENEFITS -- AND CONSEQUENCES OF AND HEALTHY FORESTS SO I THINK AGAIN YOUR THIRD PANEL WILL TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THAT IS THE THEME OF SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SO I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT ANOTHER VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNHEALTHY FOREST'S THIS SUCH REPORTER TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT THAT HERE IT IS FOR YOU IN VISUAL FORM OF THE TWENTY LARGEST AND TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE. FIRES SINCE CALIFORNIA HAS STARTED TRACK YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE BEEN VERY. NOTABLY CLUSTERED IN THE PAST TWO DECADES AND THE TOP. MOST DESTRUCTIVE WHEN WE PUBLISHED OUR REPORT THEM LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE HAD JUST HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EVEN SINCE WE'VE PUBLISHED THOSE HAVE BEEN SURPASSED BY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES. SO TURNING TO PAGE. FOUR I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE HAD MORE RECOMMENDATIONS THAN ARE SHOWN HERE IN OUR REPORT AND SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED IN THE LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION -- SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD ABOUT FUNDING FOR PILOT PROJECTS FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH WOODY BIOMASS AND MAKING SOME CHANGES TO SOME OF CAL FIRES PROGRAMS FOR LANDOWNERS TO MAKE THEM EASIER -- TO TO UNDERTAKE SOME OF THEIR OF FORCE PROJECT SO -- TO THIS IS A SCALED DOWN VERSION WHICH IS GREAT. I'LL TALK JUST PRIMARILY ON THESE FIRST THREE BULLETS THAT OUR OVER ARCHING AROUND IMPROVING AND INCREASING FUNDING IN COORDINATION. THE FIRST ONE IS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY. ABOUND THE REAL NECESSITY FOR CLEAR PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA OVER HOW WE USE OUR FUNDING AND HOW WE'RE TARGETING -- THERE'S SOME PROGRESS BEING MADE ON THE HERE AT AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY ONE THAT IS DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATION TO PUT TOGETHER PRIORITIZATION PLAN. BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS CNH OVERSIGHT HEARING IN EACH BUDGET APPROPRIATION HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE WE'RE MAXIMIZING THE USE OF OUR FUNDING AND WHAT CRITERIA ARE WE USING -- A THE FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF YOUR NEVADA CONSERVANCY WOULD TALK ABOUT LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT -- UNDERTAKING RANDOM ACTS OF RESTORATION WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A GREAT. WAY TO THINK ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WERE REALLY BUILDING ON THE EFFORTS WERE DOING AND AND ENTERING IN THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD BE PRIORITIZE AND WE COULD PRIORITISE KEY WATERSHEDS. WE GET PRIORITIZE PUBLIC SAFETY WE GET PRIORITIZE GREENHOUSE GAS -- REDUCTION WE COULDN'T PRIORITIZE WHERE WE HAVE PARTNERS IN PLACE THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- AVENUES WE COULD USE BUT IF WE'RE KIND OF STRIKING -- IN TRYING TO STRIKE EACH ONE WE MAY LOSE THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS THAT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MAXIMIZE GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE LIMITED FUNDS. THE SECOND BULLET AT THIS WAS ALSO TOUCHED ON ALREADY IN SOME OF THE CONVERSATION WE RECOMMENDED IN OUR REPORT ELEVATING THIS ISSUE TO AN AGENCY LEVEL AND HAVING A FOUR A FOREST HEALTH TEAM. OUT OF RESOURCES AGENCY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF THESE PROACTIVE FOREST HEALTH ACTIVITIES. CERTAINLY COVER WOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT BUT THERE WERE TWO REASONS WE THOUGHT THAT THIS MADE SENSE FIRST TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE SILOS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS -- ESPECIALLY WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE AND WATER BOARD AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PERMITTING -- AND FOR AND ALLOCATING FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE MORE STREAMLINED AND SEAMLESS BUT ALSO SECONDLY GIVEN THE EXTENDED WILDFIRE SEASON THAT WE'RE SEEING. HOW FIRES UNDERSTANDABLY? HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF ATTENTION SPECIALLY AT THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL RESPONDING TO THESE FIRES FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND WE THOUGHT THAT HOUSING IT AT THE AGENCY LEVEL COULD KEEP THE FOCUS. ON EVEN SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS LIKE DEVELOPING GRANT CRITERION MAKING SUR GRANTED GRANTS GET OUT THE DOOR -- YOU WHEN CAL FIRE LEADERSHIP MAY BE AGAIN UNDERSTANDABLY AND AND JUSTIFIABLY FOCUSED ON FIGHTING FIRES THAT WE DON'T LOSE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND THEN THE THIRD BULLET THIS IS AN AREA THAT HASN'T HAD AS MUCH -- LEGISLATIVE FOCUS IN THE RECENT LEGISLATIVE PACKAGES IN RECENT MONTHS. REALLY LOOKING AT WHO ARE IS BENEFITING FROM OUR FOREST AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS -- CONTRIBUTING TO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND SPECIFICALLY ARE THERE WAYS THAT DOWNSTREAM WATER USERS SHOULD BE -- GENERATING AND CONTRIBUTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES TO KEEP OUR FORESTS HEALTHY SO WE HAD THREE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS HERE THE FIRST REQUIRING THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO MAKE AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION. TO HELPING MAINTAIN THE HEALTH OF THE FEATHER RIVER WATERSHED -- DEBTS OF THEY CONTRIBUTE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT WE THOUGHT. WE THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF MAY PERHAPS TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THAT WOULDN'T CAUSE ON DO YOU. FISCAL BURDEN ON REPAIRS BUT ALSO WOULD HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THE WATER SOURCE. SECOND WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO TRY IN ENCOURAGE WATER AGENCIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE BENEFITING FROM THEIR WATERSHEDS AND UNDERTAKE SOME. IT COST AVOIDANCE FOR IN THE CASE OF WATER -- WILDFIRES OR COST BENEFIT STUDIES FOR HOW INVESTMENTS MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO HELP JUSTIFY TO THE RATE PAYERS WHY THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS MIGHT MAKE SENSE. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INSTANCES OF AGENCIES THAT HAVE DONE THIS NOTABLY AT EASTBAY MUD IN THE MCCALL MANY WATERSHED AND PLASTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY -- SO WE THOUGHT THE STATE PROVIDING SOME MATCHING FUNDING TO HELP INCENTIVIZE SOME OF THAT ACT ACTIVITY BY LOCAL WATER AGENCIES MIGHT -- MAKES SENSE TO HELP AGAIN -- DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE THAT THERE WAS -- RECOMMENDATION ON A WATER GRANT PROGRAM THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES RUNS TYPICALLY BOND FUNDED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS COULD BE WORKED INTO A FUTURE -- WATER BOND WHERE THEY ARE INCENTIVE POINTS GIVEN TO AGENCIES THAT ARE SUBMITTING GRANT APPLICATIONS TO DO WORK -- IN THE UPPER WATERSHED REALLY CAUSING FOLKS TO LOOK UP AND SEE WHETHER WATER SOURCE COMES FROM. PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT IS JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE IT'S SHOWS YOU THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED SINCE THIS IS PARTLY A BUDGET COMMITTEE. MEETING. YOU CAN SEE. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS PRIMARILY FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS -- TO JEFF BUT ALSO SOME I'M PROPOSITION. SIXTY EIGHT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THESE -- INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE PANEL SO REALLY JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE. AND THEN FINALLY -- PAGES SIX AND SEVEN WE HIGHLIGHT SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ON NOT JUST TODAY BUT IN THE COMING. WEEKS MONTHS AND YEARS AND AND YOU ALL ARE RIGHT IN IT THAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS ALREADY TODAY -- ARE WE HIT IT'S WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS ARE WE MAKING ARE THERE BARRIERS ARE CHALLENGES THAT YOU ALL CAN HELP WITH THROUGH ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION. HOW ARE WE INSURING WHAT'S A PRIORITIZATION THIS THEME HOW ARE WE INSURING WHERE ACHIEVING OUR BENEFITS -- WHAT PROACTIVE STEPS ARE DEPARTMENTS TAKING AND PARTICULAR CALVARY NOW SINCE THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF MOST OF THE MONEY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE HITTING ALL OF OUR TARGET AREAS AS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS MENTION NOT WE'RE NOT JUST GIVING THE FUNDING TO THE BEST GRANT WRITERS BUT WE'RE TARGETING WHERE THE FUNDING IS REALLY -- IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE MOST -- TO CHECK IMPACT. I THINK THIS FINAL ROUND THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SIX THIS SET OF QUESTIONS AROUND LOCAL CAPACITY IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO REALLY KEEP AN EYE ON DO WE HAVE ENOUGH FORESTERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO UNDERTAKE THESE PROJECTS TO WE HAVE. BEEN OF GREAT WRITERS AND LOCAL PROJECTS SPONSORS OBSEQUIES SPONSORS ARE THE TYPES OF OF PROACTIVE WORK NEEDING TO BE TAKEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE AREAS WE NEED THEM TO BE DONE ARE THERE ADDITIONAL STEPS THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE TO BE SURE THAT WERE -- UNDERTAKING THOSE PROJECTS IN THE KEY AREAS. PAGE SEVEN WHAT CREATURE WE USING TO ALLOCATE FUNDING ACROSS THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AS WAS ALREADY ASK BETWEEN FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION THAT SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS LARGELY DELEGATED TO CAL FIRE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ACROSS THOSE TO PROGRAMS. THAT MAY BE SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE IF YOU'RE NOT. COMFORTABLE WITH THE DECISIONS YOU'RE MAKING THEY'RE MAKING YOU MAY WANT TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN HELPING MAKE THOSE ALLOCATION DISCUSSIONS DECISIONS AS WELL. AND THEN HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WERE YIELDING SUCCESS WHAT KIND OF METRICS THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE HOW DO WE KNOW IF WE AVOIDED A SEVERE WILD FIRE OR NOT THESE THESE ARE THESE ARE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BUT WE DON'T. SPECIALLY WITH THE LEVEL INVESTMENT THE STATE'S MAKING WE DON'T I'VE SPENT A BILLION DOLLARS AND WONDER WHAT WE GOT FROM IT. SO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH THE SCIENTISTS WHO CAN DO THIS KIND OF RESEARCH AND THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RUNNING THESE PROGRAMS ABOUT HOW ARE WE MEASURING SUCCESS AND HOW ARE WE IDENTIFYING THE AREAS THAT WE THINK WE WILL. GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK. SO REALLY ENCOURAGED TO SEE THESE QUESTIONS ALREADY BEING A FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND WE REALLY THINK KEEPING OUR FOCUS ON THIS OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS WILL HELP. ENSURE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ARE A STRATEGIC AS WE CAN. THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD OUR QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE PANEL -- WITHOUT WILL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND MY NAME IS EASY CHIANG A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT OUR CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY AND HOW THE STATE'S NATURAL WORKING LANCE FIT INTO THAT STRATEGY. SO YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY ABOUT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPACTING OUR LANDS AND THE NEED FOR US TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE. CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT FROM WORKING LANDS IN CLIMATE MITIGATION SINCE OUR FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE COPING PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT R. NATURAL WORKING LANDS INCLUDING FOREST'S FOR THE ONLY FACTOR THAT CAN SEQUESTER CARBON THAT IS THEY CAN PULL CARBON DIOXIDE. OUT OF THE AIR FROM A CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION PERSPECTIVE THAT MAKES THE SECTOR UNIQUE. I WILL CARB RECENTLY COMPLETED THE FIRST NATIONAL WORKING LANDS GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY. LANDS EXPERIENCED A NET LOSS OF OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND TWENTY FOURTEEN MOST OF THAT IS DUE TO WILD FIRE. THAT TRANSLATES TO OVER SIX HUNDRED AND ENDS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT OVER THAT TIME. NOW WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY WE SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT FIRE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECOSYSTEMS IT BELONGS ON OUR LANDSCAPES. BUT WE NEED TO STRIVE FOR NATURAL SYSTEMS IN WHICH FIRE IS PART OF A REAL ZILLION SYSTEM THAT SEQUESTERS MORE CARBON THAN IT LOSES. OUR MOST RECENT SCOPING PLAN WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD IN LATE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS PLAN CALLS FOR NEAR TERM ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE LONG TERM GOAL OF MAINTAINING OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AS A CARBON SINK. THE PROGRAMS THAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL TODAY ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF RESTORING OUR LANDS AND AVOIDING THE MOST CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING LANCE HAS ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONALLY. LAST OCTOBER HE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUED A SPECIAL REPORT ON CLIMATE WHICH CALLED FOR GLOBAL CARBON NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTY FORTY TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE TIME FRAME. ACHIEVING CARBONNEUTRALITY IS GOING TO REQUIRE DEEP EMISSION CUTS. AS WELL AS INCREASED CARBON STORAGE AND SEQUESTRATION. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE SOME COMBUSTION AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SEQUESTRATION INCLUDING SEQUESTRATION ON NATURAL WORKING LANDS TO BALANCE OUT THOSE EMISSIONS. NEAR TERM ACTION ON NATURAL LANDS BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY WHEN YOU REALIZE IT'S GOING TO TAKE DECADES TO HEAL THE LAND AND GROW THE TREES TO MAXIMIZE SEQUESTRATION. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ACT NOW TO ESTABLISH HEALTHY NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS FOR THE FUTURE. THEY NEED TO ADDRESS OUR LANDS FOR CLIMB IT COMES WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES. IN JANUARY CARB CALLIE PA THE RESOURCES AGENCY CDFA AND THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL RELEASED THE DRAFT NATURAL WORKING LAND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS MANAGER LANDS FOR MULTIPLE BENEFITS AND THIS PLAN EXPLICITLY ADDS CARBON SEQUESTRATION TO THOSE BENEFITS. THAT MEANS THAT STATE SUPPORTED LAND CONSERVATION RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT ACTIONS WILL BE ORIENTED TOWARD STRATEGIES THAT PROVIDE LONG TERM CLIMATE BENEFITS. BY PROTECTING CARBON STOCKS INCREASING SEQUESTRATION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO GOING TO ENHANCE THE PLANS TO THREATS INCLUDING WORSENING CLIMATE IMPACTS. TO MEET THE TARGETS IDENTIFIED IN THE DRAFT PLAN AGENCIES WILL WORK TO MAXIMIZE CLIMATE BENEFITS ALONG SIDE TRADITIONAL NATURAL RESOURCE OBJECTIVES WHEREVER POSSIBLE. ADMINISTERING ALL OF OUR NATURAL WORKING LANCE PROGRAMS UNDER A UNITED AND COORDINATED APPROACH WILL HELP US MOVE TOWARD OUR COMBINED GOAL OF NET CLIMATE BENEFITS. RESILIENT LANDS IMPROVE WATER QUALITY WILDLIFE HABITAT RECREATION AND OTHER BENEFITS. AS WE TURNED IMPLEMENTATION WE MUSTRECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING REGIONAL AND LOCAL CAPACITY FOR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. STATE OWNS LESS THAN 3% OF THE LAND IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE ROLE OF LOCAL TRIBAL FEDERAL AND PRIVATE PARTNERS CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. RESOURCES FOR CAPACITY BUILDING COALITION FORMING PLANNING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARE ALL CRITICAL. THROUGH INCREASED COORDINATION IN ACTION AND LINKING STATE POLICY WITH SUPPORT FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL IMPLEMENTATION. WE WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGE THE ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY INHERENT IN OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS. FOR MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND SUPPORTING MULTIPLE CRITICAL STATE OBJECTIVES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY TO SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES GOOD WATER GOOD AIR HEALTHY SOILS CLIMATE BENEFITS AND MORE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WHAT'S YOUR NEXT. THANKS. I'M GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU MY NAME IS ANGIE LET US SAY -- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY CAL FIRE AND I'M JUST GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT TODAY -- VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE CLAIM AND ENERGY PROGRAM -- DETAIL TO THE FOREST HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH YOU'VE HEARD. ABOUT A FEW TIMES ALREADY TODAY. THANK YOU RACHEL FOR THAT INFORMATION -- CALPERS CLIMB IN ENERGY PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO IT'S A FAIRLY NEW PROGRAM -- IT WORKS TO PLAY CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO FORESTED LANDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA BOTH STATE FEDERAL AND PRIVATE LANDS -- WHILE ALSO REPRESENTING CAL FIRE AND IN CLIMATE AND BIOENERGY RELATED WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL SUCH AS WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCIES -- NETWORKING LANDS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD'S RECENT BIOENERGY RESOURCES ECONOMY SUMMIT BY RESOURCES ECONOMY SUMMIT. AND FIFTEEN DEDICATED AS A COMMON INTERVIEW PROGRAM ALSO IT'S FIFTEEN DEDICATED STAFF THAT IMPLEMENT THE FOREST HEALTH PROGRAM AND WORK WITH OTHER CAL FIRE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUN AUCTION PROCEEDS. AND THE FOREST HEALTH PROGRAM ITSELF IS CURRENTLY CLOSING ON ITS FOURTH GRANT SOLICITATION -- IN THAT TIME THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ALLOCATED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WILL RECEIVE UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION ALONG WITH THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM -- OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS XIN REFORESTATION PEST MANAGEMENT PRESCRIBED FIRE BY MASS UTILIZATION. RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION THROUGH EASEMENTS OR FEE FOR TITLE -- AT A LANDSCAPE LEVEL -- AT SCALE OF PROJECTS AGAIN ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE HAVE A IT THROUGH THE PAST THREE SOLICITATIONS AWARDED -- OVER SIXTY PROJECTS -- ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND HAVE. THOSE PROJECTS WILL TREAT OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND THAT STARTED IN. A FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND AS I MENTIONED THE FOURTH SOLICITATION JUST CLOSED AND SO WERE -- SCORING GRANT APPLICATIONS RIGHT NOW AM AND WILL ANNOUNCE AWARDS FOR ANOTHER DOZEN OR SO PROJECTS PROBABLY NEXT MONTH. AND THE PROGRAM IS QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN FACT HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST COSTS AND PER EMISSIONS AT UNIT SAVED -- ACROSS SOME OF THE CC I PROGRAMS. SINCE THE PROGRAM STARTED CAL FIRE HAS WORKED INTERNALLY AND WITH OUR PARTNERS TO STAND UP AND STREAMLINE IT TO GET. FUNDING FROM THE BUDGET TO OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND. AT TURN AROUND TIME FROM BUDGET ALLOCATION TO ANNOUNCEMENTS HAS REDUCED FROM OVER A YEAR TO LESS THAN NINE MONTHS AND I THINK BY. OUR NEXT ROUND WE MAY BE AS LOW AS SIX MONTHS FOR THE COMPETITIVE GRANT SOLICITATIONS -- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN PILOTING DIRECT FUNDED PROJECTS -- WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED AND IMPLEMENTED THROUGH CAL FIRE UNITS AND UNIFIER PLANS AS CHIEF -- PORTER MENTIONED -- AND ALSO LEVERAGING -- AT GRANT AGREEMENT -- FOR ON GOING PROJECTS OF FOR PROJECTS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE STARTED WE CAN -- HELP IN CERTAIN MORE FUNDING TO TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT. PROJECT AND SKIP THE WHOLE PROCESS OF OF RE VETTING AND DOING DILIGENCE ON THAT PROJECT AND THEN GOING TO THE THEIR GRANTED EXECUTION GRANT AGREEMENT EXECUTIONER CONTRACTING PROCESS -- WE ARE NOW ALSO PILOTING DIRECT FUNDED AWARDS TO PARTNERS AND SO THAT'S A REALLY EXCITING PART OF OUR OF OUR PROGRAM IT'S STARTING THIS YEAR. DESPITE MAKING GAINS THE TIMING IN TERMS OF MOVING FUNDING INTO THE HANDS OF LAND MANAGERS AT PROJECTS NOW ACTUALLY HAVE LESS TIME TO COMPLETE THEIR ON THE GROUND PROJECTS. BECAUSE EXPENDITURE LIQUIDATION TIMELINES IN THE BUDGET HAVE CHANGED FROM A TOTAL OF SIX YEARS TO A TOTAL OF FOUR YEARS. AND WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT THIS FORCES PARTNERS TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS AND SOMEWHAT UNFAVORABLE WAYS AND THEY WILL SOMETIMES SPLIT PROJECTS INTO PHASES SO THAT THEY ARE ONLY ASKING FOR FUNDS THAT THEY KNOW THEY CAN ACHIEVE. IN A TWO OR THREE YEAR TIME LINE. AND ONE PHASE OF THE PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE BY TIME THEY'RE DONE THEY DON'T COME BACK FOR MORE FUNDING -- WE HAVE HEARD THAT SOME CONTRACTORS ARE ASKING -- FOR OVER MARKET RATE FOR LABOR BECAUSE THE TIMELINE IS SHORTER AND SO -- THEY HAVE TO SOMETIMES FOREGO OTHER JOBS OR JUST BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE DEMAND IS HIGH THEY ALSO RAISE THEIR RATES. AND FINALLY SOME PROJECTS ARE COMPLETING SMALLER PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE TO DO AND SO IF THERE'S ONLY TWO OR THREE YEARS TO FINISH THE PROJECT AND THEY SPEND HALF OF THAT. ON ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE THE PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS IS SIX SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN IT WOULD BE. AND THE THE PROGRAM WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM EXTENDED FUNDING PERIODS AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T JUST POINT THAT OUT THANK YOU. I'M FINALLY -- WITH FUNDING CERTAINTY WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO BEGIN INTEGRATING PROGRAM OFFERINGS WITH A NUMBER OF THE ENTITIES HERE SO WITH THE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH NATURI SOURCES AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION. AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND US FISH AND WILDLIFE -- AND THE THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. TO START ENSURING THAT OUR OUR SUITE OF OFFERINGS TO GRANTEES ARE AM ARE AT COMPREHENSIVE SET ALL ALL FACETS OF A PROJECT THAT A LOCAL ENTITY WOULD WANT TO IMPLEMENT CAN BE COVERED. BY AVAILABLE PROGRAMS -- AND WE'VE AS HERE IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY PROJECTS AND ALSO FOR PROJECTS -- FOR PARTNERS OF THEIRS IN ONE OF THEIR PROJECTS AND SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER -- TO GIVE PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS -- A SUITE OF SUPPORT YOU PLANNING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE LAST THING I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE ALSO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE US FOREST SERVICE AND AS A CHIEF PORTER MENTIONED. WE AT ALSO FUN TO THEM AND A DECENT PRIVATELY INDUSTRIAL LANDOWNERS TO ENSURE THAT PROJECTS ARE EFFECTIVE ACROSS FUNDING SOURCES IN OWNERSHIP BOUNDARIES -- WE HAVE BEGUN MAPPING EFFORTS ACROSS BOTH OWNERSHIP BOUNDARIES AND PROGRAMS AND FUNDING SOURCES SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS SPATIALLY AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER WAY THAT -- WITHIN THE YEAR WE WILL BE -- ENHANCING THAT. THE PROGRAM THAT WE DELIVER. WITHOUT BOTH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT IN WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS SO I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PLAN PRIORITIZE ACROSS REGIONS OF THE STATE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MS AVERY. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANGELA AVERY ON THE NEW EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY -- NECKLACE BUT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF THE S. AND SEE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM -- OFF LINE -- WE ARE STATE CONSERVANCY AND AS WE HAVE RECEIVED A VARIETY OF AND INITIATIVES THAT HAVE PASSED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND SO I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING. IN THIS YEAR NEVADA. REGION US STARTING WITH THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS -- A PROGRAM THAT THE ESSENCE HE DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IN RESPONSE TO A STEADILY INCREASING TREND OF LARGE AND DAMAGING WILDFIRES ACROSS OUR REGION -- WE WANT WE LAUNCHED THE WHIP AS WE CALL IT -- AS A LARGE LANDSCAPE SCALE HOLISTIC RESTORATION PROGRAM -- THAT'S BEING BEING IMPLEMENTED ACROSS OUR REGION THROUGH A STRONG NETWORK OF PARTNERS THAT INCLUDE A STATE LOCAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRIBAL GOT TRIBAL. REPRESENTATIVES AND PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT PARTNERS -- SADLY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN WE ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED OF THE WEB -- IF INSTEAD OF A COULDN'T OF OCCURRED LIKE THE CAMPFIRE AND THE INCREASE -- IN UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF TREE MORTALITY HAVE TRULY REINFORCED THE NEED FOR A STATE -- LEVEL WATERSHED SCHOOLS FULL REGIONAL SCALE. PROGRAM LIKE THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM -- THE WHIP WAS ACTUALLY CODIFIED LAST YEAR -- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT -- INTERESTING INNOVATIVE WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS UNDER THIS PROGRAM TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM A REGIONAL PRIORITIZATION TO WORKING CROSS AGENCIES -- TO IMPROVING FOR SOME WATERSHED HEALTH LOOKING AT MEADOWS AND AND THAT'S ABOUT THAT'S BIG FOCUS OF OF HOW WE ARE WORKING -- WHO TO START WITH TALKING ABOUT SOME THE HISTORY OF OUR GRANT PROGRAM -- SINCE WE SINCE OUR CREATION. WE'VE BEEN THE ESSENCE HE HAS AWARDED MORE THAN SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR PROPOSITION ONE AND NOW PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING -- ARE PROJECTS ARE HOLISTIC THEY DO -- ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS LONG TERM CLIMATE BENEFITS AND WATER BENEFITS AND ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT COME WITH INVESTMENT IN UPPER WATERSHEDS. SPECIFICALLY WE LOOK AT WORK THAT INCREASES THE PACE AND SCALE OF ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION ON THE GROUND THAT PROTECTS COMMUNITIES. THAT IMPROVES FORCED A MORTAR SAID HEALTH -- INCLUDING MEADOWS IN RIPARIAN AREAS -- IN ORDER TO PROTECT WHAT WATER SUPPLY AND PROJECTS THAT SECURE CARBON. OF AGAIN WITH THE OVERALL GOAL OF TRYING TO IMPROVE -- CLIMATE RESILIENCE FOR THE STATE BY LOOKING AT AN AREA THAT'S OUR HOME SO MANY OF THE BENEFITS THAT THAT ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PROJECTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT BUILD ON AND KIND OF OUR PART OF SOME OF THE STUFF THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM OF OTHER OF MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE TODAY. THE FIRST ONE IS THE TAHOE CENTRAL SIERRA INITIATIVE PROJECT -- THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS A LANDSCAPE SCALE PILOT PROJECT IT'S ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES. THAT IS LOOKING AT BRINGING TOGETHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERS ACROSS THE CENTRAL SIERRA NEVADA AND THE LAKE TAHOE AREAS. THIS PROJECT UTILIZES BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE TO IMPLEMENT. ECOLOGICALLY BASED MANAGED FORCE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS WHILE LOOKING TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT OF FORCED RESTORATION ECONOMY AND TO EXPLORE INNOVATIVE PROCESS INVESTMENT AND GOVERNMENT'S TOOLS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS YOU'VE HEARD -- AND YOU THINK MISS FLORIDA SIDE OF THE T. CSIA PARTNERS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN RECEIVING JUST OVER THIRTY MILLION AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS FOR HIGH PRIORITY FORCE MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. ACROSS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS. ANOTHER PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THE CHIEF SOME OF THE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE ABOUT SORT OF CROSS INVESTMENT IN AMPLIFICATION OF PROJECTS TO LOOK ACHIEVE MORE. LARGER LARGER GOLD RESILIENT SCHOOLS IS THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PLAN. THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP EFFORT ALSO UNDER THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON COORDINATING A VAST INVESTMENT ACROSS STATE AGENCY AGENCIES. UTILIZING EXISTING STATE GRANT PROGRAMS -- AND REALLY WORKING TO ENSURE THE HERE IN ABOUT A REGION. THIS GROUP IS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE INVESTMENTS TO ALIGN GRANT PROGRAMS TO TRACK PROJECT EFFECTIVENESS AND TO WHAT COLLABORATIVE COLLABORATIVELY TO ACHIEVE SHARED GOALS -- MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THIS MORNING OR MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP AND WE ALL SIGN THEM AND AMMO YOU IN LATE -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WORKING NOW TO ADD THE FOR SERVICE TO THIS GROUP -- WITH THE GOAL OF ACTUALLY GETTING WORK WORK DONE ON THE GROUND IN AND IN A WAY THAT AMPLIFIES WHAT WHAT WHAT EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S IS INTENDED TO DO. ADDITIONALLY IN A TO THE ESSENCE HE RECEIVED A UNIQUE ONE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FROM THE TIMBER REGULATION ENFORCED RESTORATION FUND -- THE GRANT WAS GIVEN I MEAN THE DELICATE APPROPRIATION WAS GIVEN TO THE US AND SEE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF WILL INNOVATIVE. A WOODEN BY AMOUNT BIOMASS UTILIZATION INFRASTRUCTURE. ODD JUST A REPORT QUICKLY ON THAT WE HAVE AWARDED TO DATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF A BIO ENERGY PROJECT. IN CAMDEN BILL -- THAT WAS INTERESTING -- MILLION I WISH -- THOUSAND HOSEN DOLLARS REMAINING BUT WE'VE GOT MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST FROM PROJECT PROPONENTS THROUGHOUT OUR REGION. PROJECTS THAT MEET NEEDS IN THE AREAS OF MILL SITE DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WOOD PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. I WANT TO ADD QUICKLY THAT A KEY COMPONENT OF WHAT THE ESSENCE HE DOES WITH THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT CAPACITY. AND WE HAVE EXPANDED THE WHIP SO THAT IT FOCUSES ONMORE THAN JUST FORCED AND WATERSHED HEALTH -- AND IS LOOKING AT HOUSE TO TO STRATEGIC LAND CONSERVATION ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT MS CHIANG MENTIONED SORT OF LARGER CALIFORNIA CLIMATE RESILIENCE -- HOW -- ARE WE RECREATION RESOURCES CAN BE PROTECTED BY INVESTING IN FORCE AND WATERSHED HEALTH -- TO MAKE SURE THAT -- SEE ON ABOUT A RECREATION RESOURCES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE VALUE AND BENEFIT TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. BUT ALSO LOOKING AT RESILIENCE HERE IN ABOUT A COMMUNITIES AND THINKING ABOUT HOW THOSE HOW ARE EFFORTS WHICH ARE REALLY FOCUSED IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES. ROME -- CAN BE PROTECTED THROUGH THE WORK THAT WE DO -- SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE WAY THAT THE US AND SEE IS APPROACHING THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES FACING THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A REGION AND OUR STATE. WE LAUNCHED THE WHIP KNOWING THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDED A TRULY DRAMATIC SHIFT AND SYMBOL THINKING ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE'RE APPROACHING FORCED HEALTH TO GET IT. TO GET AHEAD OF THE CHALLENGES THAT OF TYPES AND KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT THE ESSENCE HE IS WORKING ON ARE ALL OR ARE PROJECTS THAT WILL SECURE FOR SOME WATERSHED HEALTH IN OUR REGION -- BUT THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE BENEFITS OF THE WORK THAT WE DEAL ARE MUCH FARTHER REACHING -- AND GO BEYOND OUR REGION AND ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA REMAINS. ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND HEALTHY BECAUSE IT'S GOT CLEAN WATER CLEAN AIR -- AND A PLACE TO GO AND REST OUR MINDS. AND PLAY. SO -- I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD OVERALL OF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE DO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER DONNELLY.

NATE ONCE AGAIN I JUST APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BREAK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- CHAIR FRIEDMAN A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SO MY NAME IS CALEY BRADEN I'M NOW THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION -- AND TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU GUYS BRIEFLY ON THE WORK WE'RE DOING WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY -- TO BUILD CAPACITY OF THERE'S TO LEAVE FORCED HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION WORK -- IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK WE DID LAST YEAR -- WE PASSED THIS LEGISLATURE LEAD AND THE PASSING OF SWEEPING STATUTORY REFORMER AND FORESTRY. AND WE MADE HISTORIC FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO FORCED AND FIRE PREVENTION WORK [inaudible] AND YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS IS IS FANTASTIC BUT LET'S AS I THINK WITH THE CHAIR AND CHIEF PORTER MENTIONED IT REALLY SUCCESS OF THIS WORK REALLY HINGES. ON THE ABILITY OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO LINE UP PERMITTED PROJECTS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD AND DO ON THE GROUND -- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE PROJECTS ARE PROJECTS THAT ACTUALLY ARE WANTED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEIR PROJECTS THAT MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALSO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STATEWIDE -- PUBLIC SAFETY CLIMATE AND ECO SYSTEM GOALS. LAST YEAR OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WAS APPROPRIATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO LEAVE THIS TYPE OF EFFORT -- REALLY EMPOWERING REGIONAL LEADERS IN THE SPACE OF IDENTIFYING THE PRIORITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THEIR REGION'S DEVELOPING PROJECTS AROUND THOSE PRIORITIES. AND THEN -- GETTING THOSE PROJECTS READY TO PLUG DIRECTLY INTO OUR LARGER STATE -- FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF TODAY. THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION -- IN AT MY WORK ON THIS PROJECT THIS PROGRAM AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND WHEN I WHEN I MOVED TO THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION. WE WERE THRILLED TO CAN A PARTNER WITH THE AGENCY IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT A FIRST DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION IS A LONG HISTORY OF BUILDING CAPACITY LOCAL PARTNERS. WE HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY KIND OF OUR OUR PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP GOES BACK TO REALLY THE DUST BOWL YEARS WHEN WE ARE FORM TO WORK WITH OUR CD'S I'M PROTECTING -- THE STATE'S LANDS AND SOIL QUALITY THAT HAS GROWN OVER THE YEARS THROUGH OTHER -- FARM LAND AND SEE PROGRAMS MOST RECENTLY AND PROBABLY MOST -- CONNECT THIS IS THE WATER SAID -- COORDINATOR PROGRAM THAT RAN OVER THE LAST. FROM THE FIRST MUST THE FIRST DECADE OF ON THE TWO THOUSAND WE FROM THAT PROGRAM WE REALLY LEARNED FROM THE WATERSHED COORDINATOR PROGRAM WE REALLY LEARNED THAT. IF YOU JUST INVEST A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY INTO OUR STATE PARTNERS YOU KNOW THESE ARE STATE PARTNERS ARE OUR CD'S OR NON PROFITS ARE -- WATERSHED CENTERS THE ONE TO BRING PROJECTS TO OUR STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS ARE PRETTY MUCH AND UNDER FUNDED IN ANYTHING BUT THE GRAPH AND THEY GET SO THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE CAPACITY TO THINK STRATEGICALLY -- GO OUT AND BUILD COALITIONS AROUND PRIORITIES REALLY DO THE WORK THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A BROADER VISION THAN JUST THE SINGULAR GRANT THAT YOU GET FROM A FUNDING PROJECT. ENOUGH UP FROM A FUNDING PROGRAM. IN IN IN AS WE IMPLEMENT OUR WATERSHED COORDINATOR PROGRAM WE WE REALLY LEARNED THAT IF YOU JUST FIND ONE OR TWO STAFF PEOPLE AND SOME OF THESE NON PROFITS. YOU IMMEDIATELY SEE EXPONENTIAL BENEFITS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS -- THOSE ONE OR TWO STAFFS ARE ABLE -- TO GO OUT INTO THE FIELD AND BUILD SUPPORT BRING MATCHING FUNDS YOU KNOW. DOUBLING TRIPLING INVESTMENTS ON THE GROUND. FOR AND THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO MOBILIZE A MUCH MORE THAN JUST -- YOU KNOW. THOSE GROUPS COULD IN OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE THERE WERE JUST WILL OPERATE UNDER -- KIND OF SINGULAR GRANT FUNDING MODELS. SO WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO EXPAND UPON THIS MODEL FOR THE FORCE AND FIRE -- THE REGIONAL FORCE IN FACT PASSED THE PROGRAM WE SEE REGION'S AS THE ENGINE AND KIND OF THE MECHANICS BEHIND GETTING PROJECTS TO CAL FIRE TO THE W. C. B. TO THE CINEMATIC CONSERVANCY. TO MEET THESE LARGER GOALS A CHEAP PORTER WALK THROUGH EARLIER TODAY -- LAST YEAR FOR THIS PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW NATURAL RESOURCES WAS APPROPRIATED FUNDING AND THEN THIS THIS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROPRIATED. IS GOING TO BE PUT OUT IN BLOCK GRANTS TO REGIONAL -- REGIONAL LEADERS IN THE IN THE NORTH COASTAL SOUTH IN EASTERN REGIONS OF THE STATE. THESE BLOCK GRANTS WILL BOOK GOOD A ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ST CONSERVANCY'S LOCAL R. CD'S AM AND OTHER NON PROFITS THAT HAVE THAT REGIONAL REACH WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION BUT ALSO HAVE. STRONG FISCAL CAPACITY PARTNER RELATIONSHIP SO THAT THEY CAN. IN LISTS SUPPORT FROM AND AND HELP FROM ALL OF THEIR LOCAL PARTNERS -- IN ADDITION TO THIS THIS PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDING BLOCK GRANTS TO A STATEWIDE SUPPORT ENTITY THAT WILL BE -- INTO PLAYING A ROLE OF PROVIDING QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE WHOLE PROGRAM. AND THEN LASTLY -- THIS FUNDING WILL BE SPENT AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY ONE FROM LAST YEAR WHICH CALLED -- FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND PRIORITIZATION OF OF PROJECTS AND PERMITTING STRUCTURES WITHIN THE WATER SHEDS THAT FEED THE STATE. WATER PROJECT POST THE STATE'S WATER SYSTEM -- ONE IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS SENDING THIS GOES TO THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ON ON BARRIERS AND TRYING NEW THINGS TO GET THESE PROJECTS MOVING -- WE ON THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS INTENDED TO BE A SACRAMENTO LIGHT APPROACH -- WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE FUNDING EFFICIENTLY TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND THEN REALLY RELYING ON THEM TO COORDINATE THE STRATEGIES AND THE PARTNER NETWORKS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE. PRIORITIES -- WORK WE'RE GOING TO BE TESTING ADVANCE FUNDING STRATEGIES THAT ARE REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO IN STATE GOVERNMENT -- WE'RE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY OUR CONTRACTING PROCESS SEES SO THAT WE CAN REALLY GET GET PROJECTS MOVING THE BILL FLEXIBILITY INTO OUR CONTRACTING SO THAT AS REGION TO KIND OF SEE THE NEEDS IN REAL TIME. WE DON'T GET BOGGED DOWN BY AN OF OUR OWN CONTRACTING -- ARMED CONTRACTING SYSTEMS. WE WE WILL BE REQUIRING THAT REGIONAL BLOCK GRANT TEASE ANALYST PARTNERS SO WE WHAT WE DON'T WANT OUR SINGULAR ENTITIES DICTATING THROUGHOUT THEIR REGION'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. THE GOAL OF THIS REALLY IS TO BUILD THE KIND OF POLITICAL NETWORKS THE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND THE TECHNICAL NETWORKS TO DEVELOP. REGIONAL PRIORITY PLANS THAT BY IN AND HAVE -- RESPECT AMONGST ALL THE COMMUNITIES IN THOSE REGIONS -- THOSE THOSE REGIONAL BLOOD GRANTEES WILL ALSO -- SO THEY WILL BE KIND OF THEY'LL BE CHARGED WITH AND LISTING PARTNERS -- AGAIN THOSE THEIR SUB GRANTEE PARTNERS WILL WILL INCLUDE -- RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS WATER SAID CENTERS TRIBES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NO -- YOU KNOW AN EXAMPLE IN THIS RACE IS DISTRICT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT WITH THE INLAND EMPIRE. RESOURCE CONSERVATION TO REACH THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT. AND IT'S JUST IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE KIND OF WORK THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THE DITCHES IS READY TO REALLY PLUG INTO WHAT THE STATE'S DOING -- THIS WORK WILL BE DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH. ONE WHEN NATURAL -- WITH SITUATION WE SEE AND MANY FORCE YOU PRIDE KIND OF EFFORTS AS THAT THE CIRCLES VERY SMALL. OVER OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY COME TO THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT THESE PROJECTS IS USUALLY IT'S THE FORRESTERS WITH THE NONPROFIT THAT HAVE FORSTER'S IT'S THE IT'S THE FEDS AT THE STATE. AND WHAT WHAT THIS PROGRAM REALLY WANTS TO DO IS EXPAND THE CONVERSATION TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE IN AND AROUND THOSE PROJECTS. AND THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON THE BENEFITS FROM THOSE PROJECTS -- THAT AGAIN IS KIND OF THE SELFISH GOAL OF BUILDING POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR ITS WORK LOCALLY AND SO OUR PROGRAMS CAN HAVE A STRONG BASE TO WORK FROM WHEN YOU KNOW TWO THREE YEARS OUT WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP. ALL THIS MOMENTUM GOING AND WE SEE PROJECTS ON THE SHELF KIND OF DWINDLING [inaudible] THE LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL ALSO BE A REALLY. CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS AND IT'S A LITTLE IT'S IT'S A LITTLE MORE NEBULOUS BUT IT HAS TO BE A PRIORITY -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE WE WILL BE INVESTING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY IN TO REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE NOT SEEN. SOME KIND OF MUCH JOB OPPORTUNITY IN THE GROWTH OF THE REST OF THE STATE HAS EXPERIENCED -- WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE LABOR SHORTAGES AND SHORTAGES OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO GET TO DO THE SECRET TO DO THE PLANNING TO DO EVERYTHING ELSE. IN THIS REALLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD -- LOCAL LABOR FORCES THAT CAN ACTUALLY. PLUG INTO THIS FUNDING STREAMS OR NOT BRINGING CREWS AND FROM TEXAS AND ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES WHERE THEY YOU KNOW TRAVEL AND IN THE CALIFORNIA OFTEN TO DO THIS WORK -- IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL. AND IT'S GOOD TO JUST BE KIND OF HONEST ABOUT SUCCESS HERE IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE EMPOWERED REGIONS. THAT -- HAVE ACTIVATED AND AN ARCHITECTURE OF OF OF OF LOCAL PARTNERS LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS. IN ARE ARE ARE ARE ABLE TO BRING -- A CONSISTENT Q. TO OUR STATE PROGRAMS OF PROJECTS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS BUT ALSO MEET OUR STATE CLIMB IN NEEDS. AND OUR ECOSYSTEM AND PRIORITIES SO I THINK THE THAT THAT DISTINGUISH ARE THERE IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE BETWEEN THE LANDSCAPE IN THE SMALLER PROJECTS AS WE HAVE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. AND THEN YOU ALSO NEED TO BALANCE BETWEEN SIX THAT. MAY MEET -- IMMEDIATE PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS AROUND COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO THOSE THAT PROVIDE THE WATERSHED -- INSURANCE POLICIES. FOR FOR YEARS TO COME BECAUSE WE HAVE TO THINK BROADER THAN THE THE THE THE THREATS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF US -- AT THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS WE'VE -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING THIS FUNDING WAS APPROPRIATE AT THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH BLACK POTENTIAL BLOCK GRANTEES -- FOR THEIR PROPOSALS IN THEIR BUDGETS. WE CLOSED OUR GUIDELINES -- PUBLIC COMMENT ON OUR GUIDELINES LAST WEEK WE'RE GETTING READY TO ANNOUNCE OUR AWARDS FOR THE FOR THE BLOCK GRANT IT'S HOPEFULLY VERY SOON. AND THOSE WILL BE DRAFT AWARDS AND THEN THOSE WILL BE POSTED FOR I THINK TEN OR FIFTEEN DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL AWARDS WERE WERE SCOPING OUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH. SO HOPEFULLY THE NEXT TIME WE TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IT'LL BE SOMEBODY. ENOUGH FROM THOSE REGIONS THAT ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEEDED IN THOSE REGION THE CAN REALLY TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW. THERE HELD THEIR NEEDS ARE BEING ADDRESSED OR WHAT THEY SEE AS THEIR HORIZON LINE. SO I I GUESS. YEAH ONE MORE TO MORE POINTS OR ONE MORE POINT. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS WORK IS. REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WERE. AS WE'RE TAKING A LIGHT ALLIED APPROACH OF WATCHING OVER THE WORK THAT THEY DO. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THEY ACTUALLY DELIVER PROJECTS TO MEET OUR STATE NEEDS -- THAT IS BEING STRUCTURED AND TORE STATE FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE AND THE REGIONAL PRIORITIZATION GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN FORMED. SO IN THOSE REGIONAL PRIORITIZATION GROUPS THAT ARE UNDERNEATH TASK FORCE. THESE. THESE BLOCK GRANTEES WILL ENGAGE WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THOSE GROUPS. AND THEY WILL ALSO TAKE THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THE FORTY FIVE DAY PLAN AS IT'S BEING CALLED. AND KIND OF USE THAT AS THE THE THE PLANET IS PRIORITIZING STATEWIDE FIRE AND FORESTRY NEEDS. AND THEY'LL USE THAT ALL -- TO BRING THAT TOGETHER AND AND AND AND MAKE SURE THEY HAD IT LINES UP AND AND AND IT'S AND THEY BRING TO US PROJECTS THAT MAKES SENSE AND THAT WE WE WANT TO FUND SOME. IF IT ALL WORKS AS PLANNED WILL BE -- WILL BE IN GOOD SHAPE OVER THE SUMMER. AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE IN THE MEMBERS ABOUT THEIR SPECIFIC REGIONS AS THOSE PARTNERS ARE LINED UP SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING LATE I'M GONNA ASK EVERYONE TO TRY TO BE AS CONCISE AS YOU CAN. AND A LOT OF EXCELLENT PERMISSION ON PRESENTED. OFFERS FOR MISTER AHLERS -- ONE OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BILLS SB EIGHT FIFTY SIX REQUIRE THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND CAL FIRE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PRIORITIZE EXPENDITURES. FOR THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HEALTHY FOREST PRESCRIBED BURNS AND OTHER FUEL TREATMENT IN FOREST WATER SAID PROGRAMMATIC WORK. I'M WONDERING -- IF YOU FEEL THE THIS REQUIREMENT ADDRESSES THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRIORITIZATION YOU MADE IN YOUR REPORT OR IS THERE MORE TO BE. DONE AND IF SO WHAT DIRECTION WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE DO THAT WORK. YEAH I THINK AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW THERE WAS DEFINITELY PROGRESS MADE AND I AND I AND IF THAT WASN'T CLEAR THAN I I TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR PROGRESS MADE ON THIS LAST YEAR BOTH BOTH THROUGH SB FIFTY SIX AS WELL AS AB. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY ONE I THINK OUR OUR MAIN POINT TO YOU IS THIS NEEDS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CHECK BACK AND SEE WHAT THOSE PLANS COME BACK TO YOU AS AN ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE CRITERIA THAT THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING -- BUT ALSO HOW IS IT BEING IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE I THINK. PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOKED AT THE THAT FORCE HEALTH GRANT PROGRAM NOW ALL OF THE CRITERIA THEY LIST ARE -- SEEM GOOD AND AN APPROPRIATE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM AND SO I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT. I BEAT THE THAN THAT SUCH A TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE SO MANY NEEDS THAT IF -- IF WE CAN CONTINUE TO HIT ALL OF THOSE PRIOR TO POSITION CRITERIA AND STILL NOT HAVE A STRATEGIC CUMULATIVE IMPACT BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS AND SO I THINK. THAT'S OUR MAIN MESSAGE TO YOU IS -- WE'RE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS BUT LET'S LET'S KEEP OUR EYE ON IT AND CAN CONTINUE HEARING BACK AND AND ENSURING THAT. THOSE GOALS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED GOT IT THANK YOU. OF MR BRADY -- I WONDER IF YOU CAN JUST. BRIEFLY EXPLAIN IF THERE ARE OTHER REGIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN LARGE INITIATIVES LIKE THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. AND ALSO WHAT THE SCOPE OF AREAS. SO THERE. THE REGIONS THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED IN OUR PROGRAM COVERALL OF THE MAJOR FORCE IT REGIONS OF THE STATE -- AND WE WE WERE WORKING WITH THE CINEMATIC CONSERVANCY IS ONE OF THOSE THAT WE SOLICIT A PROPOSAL FOR FOR OUR PROGRAM -- THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THE MODEL THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EXPORTING IN THIS PROGRAM. AND IT REALLY IS YOU KNOW. BEING ABLE TO FULLY DEVELOP THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND ALL OF ITS LARGE JURISDICTION WOULD BE. EXCELLENT -- I I MAY NOT BE THE BEST PERSON TO SPEAK ABOUT ALL OF THE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS IT BECAUSE IT IT DIFFERS FROM REGION TO REGION BUT JUST IN MY OWN WORK SETTING UP THIS PROGRAM -- WE HAVE. WE HAVE WE HAVE REALLY STRONG FEDERAL PARTNERS AND I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN REALLY SURPRISED AT HOW STRONG THOSE ARE YOU KNOW ACROSS THE STATE I KNEW FOR EXAMPLE IN THE NORTH -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK UP IN THE CLAIMS CASCADES IT'S KIND OF A LINE PRIORITIES AND UP INTO THE THAT THE TRIBUTARIES DOWN IN THE IN THE NORTH NORTH NORTH COAST AREA. BUT EVEN DOWN INTO THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE THERE'S JUST A REAL CONVERGENCE AND CONSENSUS FORMING BETWEEN THAT THE MANAGERS OF THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS. TO ALIGN THEIR PRIORITIES AND THEIR WORK SO. I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE. RATE AND HOW DOES THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY PLAN UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGE WATERSHEDS AND I'M WONDERING HOW THOSE NEEDS AND FUEL REDUCTION NEEDS -- INTERACT -- INTERSECT. IT IT IT IT IS DIFFERENT IN EACH REGION -- BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS SO THE PARTNERS WERE TALKING TO IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE REGION HAVE VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE WITH THE SOUTHERN -- WITH THE WITH THE SANTA ANA RIVER YOU KNOW WATERSHED WATER DISTRICTS AND WE WE REALLY HELP TO BRIDGE THAT -- THAT ISSUE WITH THIS PROGRAM HAVE WATER DISTRICTS WHO WHO WHO KIND OF INTUITIVELY UNDERSTND THE BENEFITS OF THIS WORK BUT THEY HAVEN'T QUITE GOTTEN INVOLVED IN. PUSHING THE ENVELOPE AND PARTICIPATION -- WE HOPE THAT BY TAKING ONE STEP FORWARD AND KIND OF WORKING WITH THE PARTNERS THAT THEY'RE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH YOU CAN START TO BRING THOSE WATER WATER DISTRICTS IN WHO DO UNDERSTAND THE WATER FILLED THE LARGER WATER SAID NEEDS FOR WATER SUPPLY -- IN A WERE YOU HAVE TO UNLESS THE ALSO THE PARTNERS AND UNDERSTAND THE OTHER BENEFITS OF A WATER SAID AND BRING THOSE INTO THE FALL THAT YOU BUILD PRIORITIES -- TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENT LIKE -- RACHEL JUST MENTION IT WILL BE. IT'LL BE DIFFERENT EVERYWHERE AND ANOTHER PIECE IN A WERE WERE SHAPING IN THE NORTH AND THE NORTHERN DISTRICT NORTHERN REGION WE'RE LOOKING AT WE WE HAVE SHAPED AROUND THE THE WALK THOUGH THE NORTH COAST REGIONAL WATER BOARD. DISTRICT WHICH IS REPRESENTS THE WATER SAID SET ALL DRAIN INTO THE INTO THE PACIFIC. THAT ARE ALL KIND OF COVERED BY THE SAME REGULATORY BODIES OF THANK YOU -- IS A VERY A SPEAKNG OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M WONDERING HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS INTERACTED WITH YOUR WORKING WITH THEY'VE A GOOD PARTNER FOR YOU. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE US FOREST SERVICE HAS BEEN A CRITICAL PARTNER IN THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THEY WERE ONE OF THE THEY WERE A KEY PARTNER WHEN WE ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED THE WATERSHED AND LAUNCH THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN AND OUR PARTNERSHIP IS SHIFTED A LITTLE BIT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AS WE HAVE. TRIED TO FOCUS MORE ON GETTING WORK DONE ON FEDERAL LANDS TO YOU KNOW ADDRESS ALL OF THE VALUES AND AND AND AND FORCE HEALTH NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE ACTUALLY ADDRESSED SO -- ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT AS WE'VE ESTABLISHED A GOOD AND REGION FOUR AS IT RELATES -- TO AT THE SIDE OF OUR REGION AND WE'RE TRYING TO UTILIZE THAT TO GET -- ARE FUNDING THE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US ON THE GROUND IN MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE QUICKLY TO ADDRESS ISSUES. RAPIDLY GREAT SO ONE OF THE MESSAGES I'M HEARING OVER AND OVER FROM ALL OF YOU IS ABOUT THE COORDINATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT BETWEEN DIFFERENT ENTITIES NOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND I'M JUST WONDERING I'LL OKAY SO ASK YOU MS EVERY -- WHETHER THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP FOSTER ANY OF THAT COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION. YOU CAN SAY NO IF YOU WANT I KNOW. IT'S IT'S A GOOD QUESTION BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW -- AGENCIES LIKE OURS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS AND LOCAL PARTNERS ARE CRITICAL TO WHAT WE DO WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ANYTHING THAT WE IMPLEMENT UNLESS WE'VE GOT INPUT FROM OUR PARTNERS -- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY ON THE SPOT -- IF THERE'S ANYTHING LEGISLATORS COULD DO TO IMPROVE THOUGHT -- OUR RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED ON I THINK TRUST AND OF OUR AVAILABILITY AND OUR DESIRE TO SORT OF RAISE LOCAL ISSUES UP TO STATE. HERE'S IF YOU WILL -- SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE DIFFERENT THOUGHTS ON NOT BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S A THING THAT THE ESSENCE HE IS REALLY GOOD AT THAT WE SUCCEED I'D AND I CAN IMAGINE HOW YOU WOULD. IMPROVE THE THERE MAY BE WAYS I'M NOT THINKING OF I I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO THE YOU KNOW THE R. C. D. EXAMPLE THAT KIND OF SHOWCASE HOW. MANY OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING AMAZING WORK WITH PRACTICALLY NO FUNDING. AND IN A SPECIFICALLY WITH OUR CD'S THEY ARE ONE OF OUR STRONGEST PARTNERS ACROSS ALL OF OUR WATER SAID WORK. AND IN MANY OF THEM YOU KNOW NOT ALL OF THEM BECAUSE SOME OF THEM DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING. MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE ANY -- TAX BASE TO WORK FROM AND THERE'S THERE'S SOLELY DEPENDENT ON GRANTS IN THE THE SMALL BITS OF ADMIN THEY GET FROM THOSE GRANTS -- TO OPERATE SO -- FOR US IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THIS IS THE GOAL OF OUR PROGRAM I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST THIS IS JUST A ONE TIME PROGRAM YOU KNOW FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE STRATEGIC. LONG STANDING PARTNERS TO THE STATE THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME AND STATES CAN ASSURANCES THAT THEY HAVE. THEY CAN BUILD A PROGRAM AROUND THESE THESE CALLS OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST CHASING OPPORTUNISTIC LEE WHAT WE THROW OUT THERE ON THE TABLE. I JUST WANT TO SECOND WHAT HE'S SAYING ADICIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT CAPACITY BUILDING TO REALLY -- ADD -- TO WHAT THESE GROUPS ARE. ADD TO THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GROUPS ACTUALLY IT'S AND IN THE REGION'S WOULD BE HELPFUL SO. CORRECTION. CAN I MAKE ONE QUICK COMMENT ALSO TO ADD ON TO THAT AND I THINK IT GOES BACK TO DIRECTOR PORTERS COMMENTS THIS MORNING ABOUT WORKING WITH LANDOWNERS. IN YOUR C. D. REALLY PROVIDES A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WORKING WITH THE LOCAL LANDOWNERS. IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE NEED TO WORK AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING. BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY OWN PROPERTY AND THAT THE AREA THEY LIVE THERE SO THEY PROVIDE THAT NEXUS BETWEEN THE LOCAL THE LOCAL THE LOCAL LANDOWNERS. AND THE AND THE GOVERNMENT SO I THINK THEY'RE CRITICAL AND AND WE'RE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU KNOW LAST MISS AVERY A LAST QUESTION WHICH IS ARE THERE ANY BARRIERS THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY. TO INCREASING THE SCOPE IN THE PACE OF YOUR OF THE RESTORATION WORK IN THIS YEAR AS THERE ARE. A VARIETY OF BARRIERS INCREASING THE SCOPE AND PACE BUT I THINK THAT -- IN SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING THE TAHOE CENTRAL SEER INITIATIVE AREA WORK WE'RE EXPLORING HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS VIA -- LARGE LANDSCAPE SCALE PROJECTS -- WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS -- TO ESTABLISHED. LONGER TERM STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY GET -- MORE OF THE BIOMASS THAT NEEDS TO FOREST'S TO ON THE FACILITIES THAT NEED TO PROCESS IT -- BE THOSE BY AMOUNTS. OF ENERGY OR BIOMASS UTILIZATION OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWO ZERO INITIATIVE AREAS ALSO LOOKING AT STREAMLINING -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERMITTING PROCESS SEES AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT AS WELL -- AT SB NINE A ONE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE BARRIERS LAST YEAR IN THE SENSE OF LOOKING AT A SECRET EXEMPTIONS AND THINGS THAT ALLOW US TO GET WORK DONE MORE QUICKLY -- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE INITIAL ONES THAT I CAN THINK OF GREAT. AND THEN -- MISS CHANG I JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU FIRST OF ALL -- WE'VE BEEN INVESTING WHAT DO BEST OPTION IS FOR MATERIAL REMOVED FROM THE FAR AS FOR AIR QUALITY AND GHG EMISSIONS I KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIT OF A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT I'D LOVE TO HEAR. YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM -- FROM YOUR AGENCY SURE THAT IS SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE'S ONE BEST ANSWER TO THIS AND I THINK THAT -- ENCHILADAS MENTIONED -- IN HER REMARKS THAT THERE BE HOSTED WITH UC BERKELEY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO A BUYER WILL COME TO ME FROM IT AT ON THE CAMPUS AT BERKELEY AND IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO LISTEN. TO THE POTENTIAL THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY MOVE BEYOND THE KIND ABOUT BIO MASS PROJECT THAT WE ALL THINK ABOUT SO WE THINK ABOUT THESE DIRTY BIOMASS PLANTS. MANY OF WHICH ARE IN COMMUNITIES OF THAT -- REALLY CAN'T TAKE THAT POLLUTION BURDEN AND AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOVE BEYOND THAT INTO AN ECONOMY WHERE WE HAVE. BUT THAT THEY ARE CLEANER BIOMASS PLANTS WHETHER WE ARE USING THIS WASTE PRODUCT TO MAKE TRANSPORTATION FUELS. ON THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS OUT THERE BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO DO THAT AND HOW WE AND SENSE THOSE THINGS. AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS THERE ARE AND WE HAVE TO FIND PLACES TO PUT THIS WASTE RIGHT NOW AT THE PERFECT SOLUTION THIS IS LOOKING AT THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED ON THE GROUND SORT OF IN THE REALITY THAT WERE LIVING AND I'M. I I WAS ACTUALLY -- AND ENCOURAGED BECAUSE OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS I'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF FOLKS THAT ARE LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE TAKE FOREST WASTE HOW CAN WE TAKE AGRICULTURAL WASTE. AND MAKE PRODUCTS OUT OF IT THAT WE COULD SELL AND THIS IS KIND OF A A WIN WIN WIN IT GIVES US SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WASTE IT PROVIDES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES -- IT AND IT MERE DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROJECTS ARE DONE CAN HELP US FROM A CLIMATE PERSPECTIVE SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF WINDS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR IS WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS GOING FORWARD RIGHT. I KNOW ANY QUESTIONS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL -- AS A NEW MEMBER OF SUB THREE THIS HAS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT PRESENTATION -- I AND I AGREE MISS ELLERS THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THIS. EVERY YEAR OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS WE CAN'T WAIT TO THE END OF FIVE YEARS AND SAY WE SPENT FOR A BILLION DOLLARS WHAT WE DO AND DID WE REACH. THE THE GOALS THAT WE HAD SET OUT TO DO. THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A GOAL FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE KEEPING TRACK AND WE ARE. WE DO HAVE METRICS -- WE WE WE DO HAVE. THAT WE DO REACHING GOALS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OTHERWISE AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS IN THE BILLION DOLLARS. I DON'T WANT TO BE TALKING TO THE TAXPAYERS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE. I I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR MS LOTUS -- AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS YOU SAID THAT THERE WERE SIXTY PROJECTS. AND YOU MENTIONED IT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID PLEASE -- SURE OF COURSE SO -- SPECIFICALLY I THINK I SAID OVER SIXTY PROJECTS I LIKE TO HEDGE IN THAT WAY OKAY -- AND AT THE HAVE BEEN AWARDED A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CANCER THAT IS -- THREE THREE THREE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS AND FISCAL YEAR FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ONE IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND THEN -- THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ALLOCATION HAS ALSO BEEN AWARDED. I AM WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OF SELECTING PROJECTS FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ALLOCATION OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION. FOR THE FOREST HEALTH ARE ARE WE SAYING IT'S AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY PROJECTS A YEAR. AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THAT IN THAT FOR THE VERY FIRST YEAR IN FISCAL YEAR -- FOURTEEN FIFTEEN CAL FIRE DISTRIBUTED THE FUNDING THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SO WITH THAT YOU'RE A BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY -- AWARDED THIRTY FOUR PROJECTS AND AND THEY WERE MUCH SMALLER. AND MANY -- A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THEN IN FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS PROGRAMS GOT ROLLED UP INTO THE FOREST HEALTH OF PROGRAM OR MANY OF THEM DID. AND THEN WE STARTED -- AWARDING MUCH LARGER AND ONE TO FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS THAT WERE REALLY LOOKING AT INTEGRATING A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES WHERE WE WE ASK APPLICANTS TO BRING US PROJECTS THAT HAVE -- SEE -- YOU KNOW USUALLY THREE OR MORE OF THE ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES IN THE THE PROJECT LINE UP SO THEY'RE DOING REFORESTATION AND FUEL REDUCTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WATERSHED IN WAYS THAT COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER FOR THEIR THE GOALS OF THAT COMMUNITY. AND AND SO IN IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE AWARDED SIX PROJECTS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE WERE. TO TWENTY TWO SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S MORE THAN. SIXTY IT IS I THINK. SIXTY TWO I'M SURE IT IS IF YOU SAID IT WAS OVER. SIX AND I ALSO WANTED TO COMMENT -- MISTER BRIGHT. COMMENT THAT YOU MADE TO THAT WE NEED TO THINK BROADER THAN THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS WE FACE NOW. AND THAT GOES BACK TO THE SAME THING WE HAVE TO HAVE A BIGGER PLAN. AND WE NEED IT'S ALL SMALL PROJECTS BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A BIG PLAN. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE A GOAL WE'RE NEVER GOING TO REACH IT WE HAVE TO STATE THE GOLDEN KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO REACH IT WE NOW HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME A BILLION DOLLARS. OVER FIVE YEARS -- I I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS SHOULD MANAGE IT SOME LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW IT IS BEING MANAGED AND TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE IT. IN THE RIGHT DEPARTMENT UNDER THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP -- TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK AS THEY SAY. BUT THANK YOU ALL I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU I HAVE ONE QUESTION. IT'S IT'S EXCITING TO SEE THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER AND THE COLLABORATION BEEN ABLE TO FOSTER OVER THE YEARS AND A HIGHER EXPANDING THAT ASK MONIES QUICKLY BEING INFUSED AND HOW YOU'RE WORKING TO FIND WAYS TO EXPEDITE THAT AND EMPOWER THE LOCAL GROUPS. OUT THERE -- I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT SPECIFIC THINGS WERE DOING RIGHT NOW AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- AND MAKING SURE THAT. COM A YEAR FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME CLEAR IT'S SOME CLEAR METRICS AND TRANSFORMATION ARE DELIVERING TO THAT AND I UNDERSTAND SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM IT'S GONNA TAKE DECADES TO MAKE SURE SOMETIMES THAT WE ARE GOING ON THAT PATH WHEN DID WE PROJECT PROPERLY. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT AND NOT JUST A FIVE YEARS BUT A YEAR FROM NOW WHAT ARE WE TELLING THESE TROOPS ON THE GROUND THAT THE NEED TO BE DOING HOW WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE ARE THEY WERE OF THAT ARE WE GOING TO FIGURE THAT OUT LATER. WHEN I GET NEARLY KILLS -- FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD LAST YEAR -- WE IMPLEMENTED A MONITORING PROGRAM WE HIRED A STAFF PERSON. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WE WE RECOGNIZE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GO OUT AND MONITOR EVERY PROJECT -- ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR GRANT AGREEMENT IS THAT -- GRANTEES ARE TO REPORT BACK TO US ANNUALLY SO THAT WE RECEIVE THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MONITORING THAT THEY DO ON THE GROUND. SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE ALL OF THOSE BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE AS THE VERY VERIFICATION OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THOSE REPORTS. SO WE DID WE LOOKED AT THE TOTAL SUITE OF PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE DONE. OVER THE YEARS AND WE'VE FUNDED OVER AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT PROJECTS ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS AT ONCE -- WE ATE WE REQUIRED STAFF THAT WE SELECTED A HUNDRED PROJECTS AND IT WENT ACROSS ALL. A IT WAS A REALLY GOOD REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS WE WILL WORK WITH -- IN OUR GRANTING PROGRAMS AND THE STAFF IS GONE OUT -- WE'VE CREATED. A ARE WORKING ON CREATING AN APPLICATION THAT YOU CAN TAKE APPLE IPADS OUT IN THE FIELD YOU CAN UPLOAD REAL INFORMATION TIMES TIME. WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE GROUND PICTURES INFORMATION YOU TAKE NOTES SO ALL THAT STUFF IS IN PLACE NOW? AND STAFF -- COMPLETED -- IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR -- THE MONITORING OF ONE HUNDRED PROJECTS. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. 98% OF THOSE PROJECTS WERE IN COMPLIANCE OF THE GRANT AGREEMENTS. AND THEY WERE ALSO MEETING THE TARGETS OF THE EITHER THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT -- DOCUMENTS THAT -- OUR ON THE PROPERTIES OR THE RESTORATION PROJECT WAS STILL ON THE GROUND WAS STILL WORKING SO. YOU KNOW IT. IT WAS A GREAT EYE OPENING FOR US THAT WE WE REALLY DIDN'T TAKE THE TIME TO DO THAT. BUT YOU KNOW WE DO WE ARE NOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT THE THE PROCESS IN PLACE AND WE'RE FINDING THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY SAYING WHAT CITY YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO. WITH OUR FUN SO IT'S IT WAS A GOOD THING. HAD. SOME SO I WOULD SECOND -- WHAT MISTER DONNELLY SAID -- AS THE GRANTING AGENCY THAT SPANS TWENTY FIVE MILLION ACRES IT'S IMPLEMENTED THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR GRANTS TO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DISTINCT ENTITIES WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST MONITORING REQUIREMENT. OUR AREA STOP OR REQUIRED TO VISIT PROJECTS ON A EVERY THREE YEARS -- AND ALSO OUR GRANTEES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO US THEIR PROGRESS -- AND THEN THAT IS VOTED ON THE GROUND BUT AS WE THINK INTO THE FUTURE AND THINK ABOUT -- HOW ALL WERE MAKING PROGRESS? WHAT'S RESILIENCE AGAIN I'M OF REFERENCE THE TAHOE CENTRAL'S HERE INITIATIVE -- PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH SO MANY PARTNERS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THAT PROJECTS IS A SCIENCE ENTERPRISE -- AND IN THAT EFFORT AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS ASSESSING -- WHAT'S GOING ON ON THAT PARTICULAR LANDSCAPE AND LOOKING AT THE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING ACTION ON THE GROUND THAT KEEPS THAT AREA OR MOVES THAT AREA TO A AND IMPROVE STATE OF RESILIENCE OVER TIME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND EXPLORING AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET THERE IN A YEAR BUT WE'RE GOING TO TRY. IS IMPLEMENTING A RESILIENCE DOT DASH BOARD AND NOT SOMETHING THAT TRACKS MANAGEMENT. ACTIVITIES OR WE ENVISION IT. TILL -- ULTIMATELY TRACK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON THE GROUND AND REPORT OUR PROGRESS -- AS WE ACHIEVE THOSE ACTIVITIES WHETHER. WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THAT AND WE'RE WAITING FOR THE RESULT RESULTS OF AN EFFORT THAT -- DOCTOR NORTH WILL YOU'LL HEAR FROM IN A LITTLE WHILE -- AND OTHERS ARE DOING ON ON THE GROUND THERE THE ASSESSMENTS OF THAT THEY'RE DOING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW ALL OF THAT FEEDS TO THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND THINGS THAT MISS SELLERS WAS BLOOM WAS MENTIONING EARLIER. INTO SOMETHING THAT. ROLLS UP THE BENEFITS COMMUNICATES THE BENEFITS. GIVES LEGISLATORS AND OTHER POLICY AND THIS IS A FUNDING DECISION MAKERS -- SOME EVIDENCE OF WHAT THE VALUE AND BENEFIT OF STATE INVESTMENT. IS AND HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL INVESTMENT. AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONCE WE TESTED IT'S ONE OF THE INNOVATIONS WERE TESTING IN THE TAHOE CENTRAL SPHERE INITIATIVE AREA ONCE IT'S TESTED INVENTED THERE. ARE HOPE IS TO ROLL IT OUT ACROSS THIS YEAR AND ABOUT OUR REGION RECOGNIZING THAT EACH REGION IS DIFFERENT AND SO THE METRICS IN THE INDICATORS THAT. INFORM -- THAT DASHBOARD -- WOULD CHANGE AND SO CLEARLY TRYING TO BASE ALL OF THOSE THINGS THOSE ITEMS AND AND WHAT GOES INTO THAT ON ON SCIENCE. AND WE'LL OBSERVATION OF WHAT'S. I WOULD JUST ADD TRADITIONALLY THE WAY THE STATE HAS -- HAS HELD PROJECTS ACCOUNTABLE IS DID YOU TREAT THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA TREAT AND THEN NOW WE'VE BROUGHT IN -- YOU KNOW SOME MATH OF OF HAVE WE SEQUESTER THE AMOUNT OF CARBON THAT BASED ON THE QUANTIFICATION THAT THEIR BORDERS COME UP WITH BUT IT'S BEEN PRETTY CONCRETE IN THAT WAY. AND SO I THINK THIS TYPE OF WORK OF REALLY BRINGING IN SCIENCE AND GOING BEYOND THAT AND SAYING HOW ARE WE MORE RESILIENT. CAN WE MODEL THAT THE IF A WILDFIRE CAME THROUGH IT WOULD BE LESS SEVERE CAN WE MODEL THAT THERE'S GREATER WATER SUPPLY THEM SNOW PACK BEING KEPT THERE OR YOU KNOW MEADOW SOAKING UP THE WATER AND WHEN WATER COMING OUT. THAT THESE ARE IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE SQUISHY MEN DID YOU TREAT THIS NUMBER OF ACRES YES I DID BUT I THINK IF IT'S IF IT'S BASED ON SCIENCE. THIS IS THE KIND OF WORK THAT REALLY THE STATE SHOULD BE PUSHING FOR AND LOOKING FOR IN ORDER TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THE TYPES OF BENEFITS THAT WE WANT BEYOND JUST. THE CONCRETE NUMBER OF ACRES. THANK YOU FOR THAT I I DO HOPE AS YOU'RE MOVING FOR THAT. IT'S NOT JUST DID YOU DO WHICH SAID YOU'RE GONNA DO BUT IS. ARE YOU DOING WHAT WE NEED FOR THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE ON AND SO I HOPE THAT THIS INNOVATION. SOMETHING THAT CAN BECOME A MODEL I'M QUICKER THAN. THE NOT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON WE'RE SURE FOR TIME -- AND SO OUR FINAL PANEL TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS IN ON THE ROLE OF WATERSHED TH THAT WATER SAID TO PLAY AS THE FOUNDATION FOR A WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW OUR INVESTMENTS IN FOREST AND WATERSHED RESTORATION CAN HELP IMPROVE. THE RELIABILITY OF OUR WATER SUPPLY. THIS IS QUESTION SEEMS PARTICULARLY TIMELY GIVEN THAT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO BE FOCUSED ON AN ILLEGAL AN ILL ADVISED EFFORT TO RAISE SHASTA THEM. INUNDATING SACRED SITES AND MILES OF THE WILD AND SCENIC MACLEOD RIVER. WITH THIS TODAY WE HAVE LAURIE WEBERN PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER OF THE PACIFIC FORCE TRUST. AND M. VERSUS GUY WHO LEADS THE LAND WATER AND EAT YOUR PROGRAM AT THE RESEARCH FOR THE FUTURE. AND MALCOLM NORTH PHD MR NOR DOES THE RESEARCH FOR IS THE COLLEGES WITH THE US FOREST SERVICE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST RESEARCH STATION. AND FRET PROFESSOR EASY DAVIS I AM THISIS POSSIBLE I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE TIME WE ARE RUNNING LATE AS YOU SEE WE'VE LOST MOST OF THE COMMITTEE -- AND MULTIPLE TEARS UP ALONG THE WAY INSIDE APPRECIATE. YOUR YOU WORKING WITH US AND I DO APOLOGIZE AHEAD OF TIME FOR GIVING YOU SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. WE WILL DO OUR BEST AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THE HEARING AND THANKS TO YOUR STAFF FOR HAVING PUT SUCH A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER -- MY NAME IS LAURIE WEBERN I AM PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER THE PACIFIC FORCE TRUST. OUR ORGANIZATION IS. COMMITTED TO CONSERVING FORCED RESOURCES FOR ALL THE BENEFITS THAT THEY PROVIDE. OF THROUGH BUILDING A REGENERATIVE FOREST ECONOMY THAT SUSTAINS PEOPLE ON THE PLANET IN THIS ERA OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO. WE'VE SEEN TODAY FIRE IS A DOMINANT FORCE IN OUR WATERSHEDS EITHER FOR ILLNESS WE SAW SO MUCH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN OR FOR GOOD AS WE ARE INCREASINGLY SEEKING TO DO WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE. OF FIRE FLOOD AND DROUGHT ARE DOMINANT FORCES IN OUR WATERSHEDS AND TODAY YOU MIGHT BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THAT WE WERE BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE PREACHER THE OROVILLE DAM. BUT HOW OUR WATERSHEDS FUNCTION. IS HIGHLY DETERMINATIVE OF THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WE HOUSE. OF THE WATER THAT FLOWS INTO OUR RESERVOIR IS HAT DETERMINES HOW MUCH WATER WE USE -- AND SO BY PUTTING OUR WATERSHED NOT ONLY -- IMPROVE THE TOTAL AMOUNT AND QUALITY AND TIMING OF OUR WATER BUT WE CAN ALSO HAVE BENEFITS ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF MITIGATION ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. UP FOR WHILE I FOR PEOPLE AND FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIES. TOOK CALIFORNIA HAS PERHAPS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX PLUMBING SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. AND WE MOVE WATER AS YOU KNOW -- SIX HUNDRED PLUS MILES FROM THE NORTH DOWN TO THE SOUTH ONE OF THE THINGS DR THORN WAS POINTING OUT EARLIER TODAY IS THAT SOME WATERSHEDS HAVE IMPACTS THAT ARE NOT JUST LOCAL BUT THEY ARE RIPPLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEREFORE WE WANT TO LOOK AT IMPACTS NOT ONLY LOCALLY AS YOU'RE POINTING OUT IN TERMS OF METRICS ON THE GROUND BUT HAVE WE ACHIEVED WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. AND THIS NORTHERN REGION OF THE STATE BOTH OVER THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS AND PROJECTED GOING FORWARD REMAINS WETTER AND COOLER THAN THE REST OF THE STATE. AND INDEED WITH IN THAT AREA THERE ARE FIVE KEY WATERSHEDS THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. THOSE IVE KEY WATERSHEDS FILLED THE DEEPEST RESERVOIR IN THE COUNTRY AND THE LARGEST RESERVOIR IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY THAT BEING THE SHASTA AND THE OR A BILL BUT THAT'S ALSO THE SOURCE OF WATER FOR THE ST LOUIS RESERVOIR FOR THE LOS VAQUEROS. SO THIS AREA OF THE STATE IS WHAT IS CORE TO DRINKING WATER FOR OVER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO ALL OF OUR IRRIGATED AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND FOR INDUSTRIAL USES. THAT'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DEPENDENCE UPON JUST THOSE SEVEN MILLION ACRES -- AS OUR PARTS POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW AND IS CONCENTRATED IN URBAN AREAS THAT RELIANCE WILL BE EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH PART OF THE STATE CONTINUES TO WARM AND DRY. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THIS THIS PROVIDE 7% OF THE POWER FOR THE STATE THROUGH THE HYDROELECTRIC CAPACITY OF THESE PROJECTS. WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT SUB OPTIMAL WATERSHED CONDITION THAT WE HAVE? THREATENS NOT ONLY ARE AIR QUALITY THROUGH THE FIRES BUT OUR WATER SUPPLY AND THAT WE HAVE TO APPROACH IT AS A WHOLE AND THAT'S COME THROUGH IN MANY OF THE COMMENTS FROM THIS MORNING -- EVEN SCALING UP. WE ARE STILL WELL BELOW THE SCALE THAT WE NEED TO BE OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SEVEN MILLION ACRES. AND COORDINATING INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES ACROSS SO SEVEN MILLION ACRES REALLY REQUIRES A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH OUR WATERSHEDS. AND THAT WAY OF THINKING REALLY IS CLOSER TO WHAT WE COMMONLY USE IN INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING. SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO BUILD A DAM YOU DON'T SAY GEE I'M GOING TO PUT DOWN A TON OF CONCRETE THIS HEARING FIVE YEARS ALL PUT DOWN ANOTHER TOWN A CONCRETE NUMBER MAYBE ALL ORDER THE REBAR AND I SHOULD HAVE SOME PEOPLE LINED UP FOR THIS. TO YOU WOULD SAY LET'S LOOK AT THIS AS A WHOLE TOP TO BOTTOM IDENTIFY OUR LABOR NEEDS ARE PROJECTS SPECIFICS. AND WHAT'S THE FINANCING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A IT UP BECAUSE EVEN WITH A BILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE STATE IT'S VERY LITTLE. WHAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS WE DO IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND WE NEVER PLAN CANNOT? SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF NEW. TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN THE TOOLBOX NOW AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY WHICH WAS MISTER BLOOMS BILL IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN ACTUALLY CODIFIED THAT WATERSHED ARE PART OF THE WATER SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE STATE. AND ENABLED US TO BE THINKING UP AND THAT WAY. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY ONE OF LAST YEAR. PUT IN PLACE A CALL FOR PLANNING AT THAT LEVEL TO HAVE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO MOVE AHEAD. IN PARTICULAR IN THIS REGION. AND THEN THERE'S A NEW FEDERAL TOOL THAT I WANT TO FLY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INNOVATION ACT. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS PROVIDING NEW FEDERAL GRANTS AND FINANCING FOR WATERSHEDS ALONG WITH THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING AND INNOVATION ACTOR WITH VIA. THESE ARE KEY TOOLS THAT CAN SCALE UP THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL TO DO THIS. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO TAKE OUR YOUNG HOMOGENEOUS FORESTS AND RETURN THEM TO OUR MORE RESILIENT STATE WHICH PRODUCES MORE WATER AS WELL THE STORES MORE CARBON. DOING THIS CAN CAPTURE MORE THAN EVAPORATES ON THE TOP OF THESE FORESTS AS WELL AS CAPTURE MORE WATER THROUGH HAVING THE KINDS OF TURBULENCE THAT. CATCHES CLOUDS AND MILKS THEM IN A WAY THAT CAN INCREASE WATER BY THOSE WATERSHEDS WITH SIGNIFICANT. IF WE RESTORE OUR STREAMS WE CAN HOLD THE WATER LONGER WE CAN TAKE THE SETTLEMENT OUT OF IT AND WE CAN RECHARGE GROUNDWATER WE CAN ALSO REDUCE FLOOD INTENSITY WHEN WE COMBINE THAT WITH RESTORING WET MEADOWS. THIS CAN REDUCE THE FLOOD IMPACTS 12240%. SO YOU CAN THINK BACK ON THE OR A VILLAIN GO GOSH IF WE'D HAVE THAT IN PLACE AND WE HAD A MORE NATURAL HYDROGRAPH WOULD WE HAVE HAD THAT DISASTER -- THIS IS KEY HERE IN LIGHT OF THE CAMPFIRE AND THE RIM FIRE THE SLIDE THAT IS ON THE LEFT THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT THE CAME DOWN FROM THE RED FIRE. THE YEAR AFTER THAT CATASTROPHE OCCURRED. WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP OUR WATERSHEDS WHOLE THINKING OF THIS IS INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT FRAGMENTING THEM FURTHER NOT DEVELOPING IN PLACES THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DEVELOP. AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE HOME THIS IS THE FEATHER RIVER. WATERSHED. THE LARGE AREA COME DOWN TO THAT LITTLE RESERVOIR. HOW DOES ONE WORK WITHOUT? THE GREAT THING ABOUT TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TODAY IN OUR MAPPING IS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS FROM SPACE AND ANALYZE THEM THIS IS A PART OF ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE. OF THE SEVEN MILLION ACRES IT TELLS YOU WHERE DO WE NEED TO WORK ON THESE STREAMS. AND THAT FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDES A GOOD TOOL TO THEN BUILD UPON AND SAY ONE OF THE SPECIFICS OF A PROJECT ARE WE DELIVERING ON THAT PROJECT CAN WE TRACK THAT BACK ON THE GROUND AND SHOW THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE -- AS WE'VE HEARD MANY TIMES TODAY MANAGING ACROSS THE CHECKERBOARD OF OWNERSHIPS IN A COORDINATED FASHION IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S ON THE LEFT IS THE MAP. WHAT'S ON THE RIGHT IS THE ACTUAL LANDSCAPE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DIFFERENCES AND OWNERSHIP LEAD TO VASTLY DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES WHICH LEADS TO DIFFERENT WATER. AS WELL AS CLIMATE THE FIRE OUT COMES. SO I WOULD BRING THIS DOWN TO A SPECIFIC AND SHOW HOW ALL THESE THINGS CAN COME TOGETHER. ONE OF THE EMPHASES THAT WE HAVEHERE IS WORKING WITH OUR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WATER SECURITY OUTCOMES AND FOR CLIMATE OUTCOMES. OF THE NATURAL APPROACH TO ENHANCING WATER SECURITY WE CAN LOOK AT WITHIN THE SHASTA A NUMBER OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S MOVE AHEAD. TO RAISE THE SHASTA DAM. THEY HAVE USED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE NGUYEN ACT TO DO PLANNING ON THAT TO MOVE AHEAD. AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE LOWER LEFT THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN THIS IS WHAT IS PROJECTED TO HAPPEN. WHEN WE RAISE THE SHASTA DAM IF WE FOLLOW THAT IT'S OF COURSE ILLEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW BUT IT HAS BEEN MOVING AHEAD NONE THE LESS? THERE WILL BE ZERO INFLOW INCREASE AND AS I SAID EARLIER WHAT FLOWS INTO OUR WATERSHEDS INTO IT FROM OUR WATERSHEDS INTO THE DANCE. IS THE ADDITIONAL WATER WE HAVE. THERE WILL BE NO MORE WATER. THERE WILL BE NO SPECIFIED FLOOD PROTECTION WILL BE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED JOB YEARS. THE IMPACTS ON FISH WILL BE NEGATIVE ACCORDING TO THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE. THE IMPACTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE NEGATIVE IT WILL INCREASE EMISSIONS. IT WILL RARELY HAVE ANY INCREASE IN SUMMER COLD WATER WHICH IS THE WATER WE MOST NEED IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR AGRICULTURE IT'S WHAT'S MOST NEEDED FOR FISH. AND THE INCREASE STORAGE IS POSSIBLE PERHAPS A THIRD OF THE TIME. UNDER A NATURAL APPROACH THE INFLOW INCREASE WILL BE ON AVERAGE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. EVERY YEAR. IT'LL VARY YEAR TO YEAR BUT THAT'S THE AVERAGE WE CAN REDUCE FLOOD INTENSITY BY 12240%. THE FIRE BENEFITS WE WERE CALCULATING THESE PRIOR TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS THAT ARE TO DATE. BUT THROUGH TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE WOULD SAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE HAVE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN JOB YOU'RE INCREASES SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THESE RURAL ECONOMIES AND THE CIRCULATION OF DOLLARS WITH IN WORLD ECONOMIES MANY OF THESE ACTUALLY FALL. IN THE MOST DEPRESSED NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT IN THE COUNTRY. SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR FISH A CLEAR EXTENSION OF COLD SUMMER WATER BY TWO TO THREE WEEKS AN INCREASE STORAGE IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL BENEFITS THAT ARE THERE. NOW WE KNOW THAT WORKING WITH. NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS. CHEAPER -- THEN IN OUR TASK OF WILL BE DISCUSSING THIS FURTHER BUT I JUST WANT TO FLANK HERE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COSTS. THIS IS FROM NEW YORK CITY IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE LET'S LOOK AT THE COST OF OR A BILL A BILLION DOLLARS IN EMERGENCY COST. IT'S ESTIMATED TO BE TWO POINT TWO FIVE TO TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN REPAIR WHICH WE SPENT ONE POINT TWO FIVE ALREADY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF THE SHASTA REYES IT'S VERY CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION? IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. THAT'S ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FOUR FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WE COULD RESTORE THE ENTIRE WATERSHED OF THIS AREA THIS ENTIRE SEVEN MILLION ACRES. NOW IN ADDITION. WE WOULD HAVE MORE WATER. WE WOULD HAVE LESS COST IN TERMS OF FIRE FIGHTING WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE IMPACTS IN TERMS OF LOSS OF THAT YOU KNOW. I FIVE TRANSPORTATION AS HAPPENED WITH THE FIRES THIS YEAR HERE FOR OF THE STATE'S FIVE MEGA FIRES WERE IN THIS REGION THIS YEAR HALF A MILLION ACRES. WE SPENT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS JUST IN THIS REGION. SO THE BENEFITS OF WORKING WITH NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE ARE MANIFEST WITH THIS. I'M I WOULD TAKE A MINUTE TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT RACHEL ELLIS WAS TALKING UP WHO'S CURRENTLY PAYING FOR THESE WATERSHEDS. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE IN THIS ROOM. TAXPAYERS AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WE DID THIS ANALYSIS SEWING ON THE KINDS OF COSTS THAT ARE COVERED UNDER AB. TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY THAT ARE DESIGNED TO RESTORE FUNCTION TO WATERSHEDS. AND SO WHAT WE CAN C. IS ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND AGAIN THIS WAS AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE TOOK AN AVERAGE OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS ABOUT THOSE COSTS ARE THEY HAVE BEEN ESCALATING EVERY YEAR. THE QUESTION IS WHO BENEFITS -- WELL I THINK THAT ONE OF THE PIECES HERE THAT IS MISSING AND RACHEL WAS REFERRING TO THIS. IS THAT THE TWO KEY BENEFACTORS. OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AND THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR SYSTEM. OUR WATER CONTRACTORS AND HYDROELECTRIC. DURING THE DROUGHT FOR FOUR YEARS THE COSTS OF P. GINNY TO REPAIRS ONE UP BY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THE COST OF WATER IN AGRICULTURE WENT UP FROM A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT TO ALMOST. A THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT SO CLEARLY THOSE ENTITIES DO PAY IN A TIME OF EMERGENCY. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS COULD WE PAY SIGNIFICANTLY LESS BUT IN A MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL WAY. AND FINANCED AS WE FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE IF WE INCLUDED THOSE BENEFICIARIES IN THIS PICTURE. AND FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT NGUYEN TAKES THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE -- INNOVATION ACT. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SHASTA THE WATER CONTRACTORS WILL BE PAYING INTO THAT? A SINGLE BENEFICIARIES THE MAIN OUTCOME THEIR WORDS IF WE PUT THAT INTO THE WATERSHED WE WOULD ALL BE BENEFICIARIES. SO IN SHORT WORKING WITH NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS A WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN. OF WHETHER IT IS FOR THE WATERSHEDS THEMSELVES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF THE WATER IN THE BOTTOM PART OF THE STATE AS A LOCAL SOURCE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. OR FOR THE FISH AND WILDLIFE THAT ARE A KEY PART OF THE HERITAGE OF THE STATE. OF THE OUTCOMES. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE WATER SECURITY FOR THE STATE AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT. WATER SUPPLY WRIT LARGE THANK YOU. BUT I'LL DIVE RIGHT IN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. OF AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY INSTRUCTIVE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA HERE WE HOW MUCH IS GOING ON HERE IT'S ALWAYS AT THE AMAZING -- AND IT'S IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE TO MAY WHAT I WAS ASKED TO DO AND BY THE WAY MY MY NAME SANDBAR TESCO I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR LAND WATER NATURE OF RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE WHICH IS ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS. THINK TANK IN WASHINGTON DC THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE -- NINETEEN FIFTY TWO BUT I COME TO THAT THAT POSITION GROUND THAT US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE MOST OF WHICH WAS FROM OF THE FOREST SERVICE -- LAST WITH AS HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR THE FOR SERVICE AS WELL AS BEING VERY INVOLVED A LOT OF THE NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND BEYOND THE ECONOMIC SPACE -- SO THE REASON I WAS VERY EXCITED TO TO COME HERE IS IS TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING AT THE CONTEXT FOR THIS ISSUE OF NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND WATER AND FOREST MANAGEMENT. AND ACTUALLY LAND MANAGEMENT LAND MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL. AND PART OF WHAT -- BRINGS ME TO THE TOPIC AREAS WHEN WE STARTED PURSUING A SERIES OF ROUNDTABLES FOR LAND WATER OUR LAND WATER NATURE PROGRAM AROUND WATER RESOURCES I'M NOT TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS. THAT WE COULD TAKE ON AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS THINK TANK WE DID A SERIES OF REGIONAL ROUND TABLES AND CHICAGO SAN FRANCISCO DENVER HOUSTON OF AN ENDING IN WASHINGTON DC. AND OF A VERY SHORT LIST OF TOPICS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED PROBABLY IN THE TOP THREE WAS AS NOTION ACROSS ALL OF THOSE LOCATIONS. THAT SOURCE WATERSHED SOURCE WATERSHED PROTECTION AN ACTIVE MANAGEMENT WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNITED STATES. OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT 50% OF WATER DOES COME OFF OF OUR DRINKING WATER COMES OFF FOREST'S. SO TO BE ABLE TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THAT LAND TO BE PROACTIVE IN MANAGING IT IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY IN THE NEAR TERM NOT ONLY FOR PARTICULAR LOCATION BUT FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE. SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT HAS LED US -- TO MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION OF MY PARTICULAR INTEREST IS HOW DO WE WHAT ARE THOSE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES I HAVE GOT EXCITED ABOUT THE TOPIC. AND I THINK PART OF IT IS THE THE COST. AND THE THE TRADE OFF IN COSTS AND AND LAURIE CERTAIN IS POINTED OUT SEVERAL EXAMPLES ON HER PRESENTATION. OF COURSE THE BIG ONE IS THE NORDICS NEW YORK CITY WATERSHED AND CATSKILLS MANAGEMENT AND A CLEAR BENEFIT IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION ORIGINALLY. VERSES THE TEN BILLION TO ACTUALLY DO THE WATER FILTRATION. SO MANAGEMENT ECOSYSTEM ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION BRING WATER FILTRATION SYSTEM REPLACE A TEN BILLION TO CONSTRUCT A HUNDRED HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. OBVIOUSLY A VERY GOOD COST BENEFIT RATIO AND THAT BUT THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OF A SERIES OF NOW DEVELOPING EGGS OF EXAMPLES THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE WORLD FOR HOW VALUABLE. THAT NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS FOR DOWNSTREAM WATER SUPPLY. IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT QUANTITY IT'S ALSO ABOUT QUALITY AND I THINK WE HAVE INCREASING EXAMPLES WHERE THE THE QUALITY OF THE WATER THAT COMES OUT OF THESE SYSTEMS. REQUIRES LESS FILTRATION LESS TREATMENT THAT HAS DOWNSTREAM COSTS ALSO BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO START THINKING ABOUT WATER IS A WHOLE IT'S NOT JUST THE DRINKING WATER BUT IT'S ALSO INTEGRATING WASTEWATER STORM WATER IN A MUCH MORE. OF AN INTEGRATED MANNER THAT INCLUDE STREAM. BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS THAT WHO PAYS FOR THIS -- AND THE THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE ABOUT NEW YORK CITY IS ALSO PLAYED OUT. IN PORTLAND -- ACTUALLY PORTLAND IN NEW YORK OUR TO ONLY FIVE LARGE CITIES IN UNITED STATES THAT HAVE ON FILTERED DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES. TO THEM IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE MANAGING THAT UP WATERSHED THEN THE COSTS CLEARLY WORK OUT. BUT IT DOES TAKE SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT TO TAKE SUSTAIN MANAGEMENT. AND THE PORTLAND EXAMPLE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PUT THEIR WATERS BUT THERE WATERSHED IN PROTECTION. DOUBLE ONE WATERSHED IS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE FOR THE THE WATER IT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THE MOUNT HOOD NATIONAL FOREST. AND THEY PUT THAT IN IN PLACE IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. OF IT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN UNDISTURBED VERY LARGE WATERSHED SYSTEM TO BOOT TO BE OPERATING WITH HIM. HOWEVER MORE RECENTLY THEY'RE FINDING THAT THEY'RE HAVING CRYPTOSPORIDIUM WHICH IS A FACTORY OF A PROBLEM DOWNSTREAM. PARTLY BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD WILDLIFE COMING AND PART MOSTLY BEAR HAVE BECOME HAVE TAKEN OVER THAT LANDSCAPE. SO NOW THEY'RE ACTIVELY MANAGING TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO THEY ADDRESS THE WILDLIFE LINKAGES THAT OCCUR WHICH HAVE OTHER THAT BENEFITS. AND ASIDE MOLD REALLY THIS IDEA OF CREATE MANY MULTIPLE BENEFITS BUT THE THE ACTUAL COST OF PUTTING IN A FILTRATION SYSTEM FOR THOSE THAT. CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IS STILL FAR LESS THAN WHAT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO BE PUTTING IN A MAJOR FILTRATION SYSTEM. AND RUNNING IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN THE OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. DENVER IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE MORE DEAR TO MY HEART. BECAUSE I WAS VERY ACTIVE IN THE FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AT THE TIME. WHEN THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FIRE IN THE THE IMMEDIATE WATERSHED ON NATIONAL FORESTS? THAT BASICALLY ELIMINATED TREE COVER RESULTED IN THE MAJOR SETTLEMENT LOADING ON THE DENVER RESERVOIR AND THEY LOST PROBABLY TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS OF LIFE OF THE RESERVOIR AND THE WATER SUPPLY BECAUSE OF THE THE SETTLEMENT LOADING. THAT RESULTED IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL FORESTS WITH MANY OF THE LOCAL BUSINESSES WITH OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS TO REDUCE THE SEDIMENT LOAD BY. ACTIVELY RESTORING THE FAR SO HAVE SOME VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAYS OUT. BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM AND THIS IS PART OF OUR AND SON OF STRUCTURE ON HOW DO YOU GET THE DOWNSTREAM BENEFICIARIES OF THAT WATER SUPPLY. TO HELP PAY UP WHERE THE STEWARDS ARE DOING THE WORK AND THAT'S THAT IS PROBABLY THE ONE LESSON TO TAKE COME FROM MANY THE OF EXAMPLES. THAT BY THE THREE EXAMPLES I'VE TALKED ABOUT NEW YORK DENVER IN PORTLAND IS THAT IT DOES TAKE AN ACTIVE -- LEGISLATURE REGULATION OF ITS CAPITALS VOLUNTARY AND HOW DO YOU THAN WORK THROUGH IT AND SOME OF STRUCTURE. TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THAT LINKAGE. AND PART OF IT FROM AN ECONOMIC SPUR OF WHAT THAT WATER IS AND AND WE HAVE VERY BAD REALLY UNDERVALUED. ACCESS TO WATER AND THE FLOW OF WATER ON OVER AND NOT JUST. IN THE UNITED STATES BUT OVERALL GLOBALLY IT'S IT'S A IT'S CONSIDERED A SOMETHING THAT WE EXPECT TO GET BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY COSTED OUT. TO JUST A FEW LAST MINUTE POINTS TO REYES AND A FEW LAST THINGS AND AND I I ALSO HAVE TO COMMAND THE THE WHOLE MOVEMENT TOWARDS MORE INTEGRATED WATERSHED BASED APPROACHES AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE SO THE EXAMPLE WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THE SIERRA NEVADA. WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IS REALLY A GREAT EXAMPLE OF MOVING FROM A PROJECT SPECIFIC. LOCAL A COMMUNITY SPECIFIC TO SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE AT A MUCH LARGER SCALE AND ALLOW THOSE TRADE OFFS -- I THINK ONE OF THE THERE WAS A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT THE ROLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE FOREST SERVICE IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE REALLY VALUABLE. PUBLIC LAND THE FEDERAL LAND MANAGERS WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I COMMEND THE RISK RECENT FOREST SERVICE STRATEGY ON TOWARDS US CHAIRED STEWARDSHIP THAT IS EXPLICITLY TALKING ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FEDERAL STATE TRIBAL AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO TAKE AN INTEGRATED APPROACH. BEING ABLE TO USE THAT AS A WAY TO CHECK END OF ACTIVITY WHERE NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING FUNDS TO THE STATES TO DO COOPERATIVE FEELS MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. TO ME THAT IS A PART OF THOSE GOOD NEIGHBOR IDEA THAT HAS BEEN FLOATED. BUT I STILL THINK WE HAVE THAT PARTNERSHIP IS A GREAT EXAMPLE BUT IT STILL REQUIRES RESOURCES AND REQUIRES A STANDARDS. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TAKE THOSE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT TO TAKE THAT THE GOAL OF BEING ABLE. TO WORK AT THE WATERSHED SCALE WITH MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES TO BE ABLE TO PUT INTO PLACE AND TO PUT IT INTO PLACE OF PRIORITY WATERSHEDS AND WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. TODAY BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET. THE DANVERS AND THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES WHERE YOU HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE AND A AND A VERY POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT WAY. A LOT OF GOOD WORK AND I I THINK THERE'S THERE ACTUALLY I PROVIDED A THE STATEMENTS THAT HAS A LITTLE MORE DETAIL AND AT THE WHAT I JUST WENT THROUGH BUT I AGAIN I APPRECIATE. BEING ABLE TO BE HERE AND THAT THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILL IN SOME IDEAS OF THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE ECHOED BY MALCOLM OVER THERE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE -- I GUESS I'M PROBABLY GOING LAST BECAUSE I'M OF FORCED ECOLOGISTS IS BEEN STUDYING THESE SYSTEMS FOR A ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW AND I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT KIND OF WHAT MAKES THE FOR IT WORKS -- AND HOW WE WOULD STORE MORE CARBON IN IT AND WHAT THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS WOULD BE OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN THE FOREST. AND I'M GONNA CUT RIGHT TO THE QUICK WHICH IS BASICALLY ALMOST ALL OF MY RESEARCH AND EVERYONE I WORK WITH HIS WORKED ON THIS. HAS SHOWN THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE ALL THREE OF THOSE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF IMPROVING WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY IMPROVING CARBON STORAGE. IMPROVING THE ABILITY OF FOREST TO BE RESILIENT TO DROUGHT AND ALSO TO BE RESILIENT TO WILD FIRE. BY RETURNING THE KIND OF STRUCTURE AND THE CONDITIONS IN THE FOREST THAT WE KNOW -- THAT WE'VE WORKED ON TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND OVER THE LAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS AND SO I THINK IN THIS CASE IT REALLY IS A WIN CONDITION IN WHICH ALL OF THOSE GOALS AND UP SYNERGIZE. TO A COMMON. GOAL OF TRYING TO GET THE FOR INSTANCE THE RIGHT TYPE OF CONDITION. LET ME START WITH THE FACT THAT I THINK YOU'VE HEARD HERE TODAY IT'S PRETTY INEVITABLE THAT BOTH DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE ARE GOING TO BE INCREASING ITS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A STRESSOR. ON FORESTS. SO WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THE FOREST'S LESS RIGID MORE FLEXIBLE TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AND RESPOND TO THESE TYPE OF CONDITIONS. GOING ON THERE. AND WHAT WE OFTEN HAVE IN OUR FOREST'S NOWADAYS IS KIND OF A BINARY CONDITION -- YOU KEEP FIRE OUT WHICH IS THE DOMINANT CONDITION IN MOST OF THE SIERRA NEVADAS AND MOST OF THE MOUNTAINS. AND THE FORCE GETS REALLY CHOCK FULL OF TREES IT'S VERY DENSE. IT'S VERY HOMOGENEOUS THERE ISN'T A LOT OF VERY ABILITY IN THE MICRO CLIMATE THE PLANT COMMUNITY IT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL CLOSE CANOPY AND THEIR OR WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET A BIG WILD CARD THAT COMES IN OR DROUGHT EVENT. AND ALMOST ALL THE TREES DIE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IT FLIPS TO BEING A VERY HOMOGENEOUS CONDITION BUT IN THE OTHER SENSE OF LACKING TREES MOSTLY DOMINATED BY SHRUBS. AND IN EITHER CASE IS OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF HOW THAT FOREST DEVOLVED AND HOW IT RESPONDS. TO THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS BOTH DROUGHT AND FIRE WHICH IS EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST THIS IS OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THOSE TYPE THE CONDITIONS. SO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU KEEP FIRE OUT OF IT. TO THE BIG THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IS YOU REALLY INCREASE THE FUEL LOAD IN THE FOREST WHICH IS WHAT ALL THE SMALL TREES ARE DOING. AND THE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS THE TREES ARE BASICALLY STRAWS. AND YOU GET TOO MANY STRAWS IN THE GROUND. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A DROUGHT OF IT LIKE WE HAD A IN THE SIERRAS IN THE SOUTHERN PART WHICH IS TO THE PRIOR PART. YOU END UP WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DEAD TREES IN THERE BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH COMPETITION FOR THE WATER. AND SO THAT FORCE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY MORE TO FLEX TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE KIND OF STRESSES. AND WHAT WE HAVE FINALLY FIGURED OUT IS HOW TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE FOR US MORE RESPONSIVE MORE FLEXIBLE TO THOSE TYPES OF CONDITIONS. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE KIND OF GETS VERY SPECIFIC HERE BUT I THINK IT'LL SHOW HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY BRING THESE THINGS SYNERGISTICALLY TO BENEFIT ALL OF THE RESPONSES. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FORESTRY HAS FOCUS ON FOR THE LAST. FIFTY SIXTY YEARS IS BIG TREES QUICKLY BOTH FOR BOARD FEET FOR FIBER FOR ALL OF THOSE KIND OF PRODUCTS. AND ONE OF THE WAYS OF DOING THAT IS WHEN THE TREES ARE GONE -- YOUR RE PLANTING AREA YOU PLANT TREES IT VERY REGULAR SPACING SO THE OPTIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THEY HAVE TO GROW IN AND THEY CAN GROW REALLY FAST QUICKLY. WORKS FOR CORN ALSO WORKS FOR TREES NOT TO SAY THE TREES ARE CORN BUT THEY DO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF RESPONSE. THAT'S THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE RESPONDED A LOT OF CASES TO THESE FORESTS BEING BURNT OVER OR TO THE TREES DYING FROM DROUGHT. BUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SPECIFICALLY WITH A LOT OF RESEARCH OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS ACTUALLY THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE TREES REALLY MATTERS. AND IN PARTICULAR THAT ARRANGEMENT MAKES THE TREES MORE RESILIENT TO BOTH WILDFIRE AND TO DROUGHT. SO AGAIN AN EXAMPLE HERE. WE WOULD HAVE SPACE TO TREAT EVENLY TO MAKE THEM GROW FAST IN THE PAST WE NOW KNOW THAT WE'LL WE'D LIKE TO DO IS HAVE THEM GROW IN CLUMPS. WITH OPENINGS IN BETWEEN THEM AND SCATTERED INDIVIDUAL TREES. WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THAT. IT TURNS OUT THAT THOSE OPENINGS IN THAT KIND OF ARRANGEMENT MAKES THE FOREST VERY RESILIENT TO WILDFIRE WHEN IT COMES THROUGH. IT ALSO MAKES THE FOREST VERY RESILIENT TO DROUGHT STRESS. AND THAT IS NOT A WAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE MANAGE FOR US WHEN WE WERE MANAGING THEM FOR MAXIMIZING BOARD FEET OR TREE GROWTH PATTERNS. BUT THAT KIND OF OPEN GAP GROUP TYPE THE STRUCTURE IT ENDS UP BEING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR BREAKING THE FOREST RESILIENT TO WHAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. THESE MORE COMMON OCCURRENCE OF EXTREME DROUGHT EVENTS AND EXTREME FIRE. AND I ALSO WANT TO BRING UP THAT POINT BECAUSE IT'S A BENEFIT NOT ONLY TO THE FOREST'S RESILIENCE IS GOING ON THERE. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY IMPROVING WITH IT IS WATER. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IS IF YOU HAD AS LAURIE WAS ALLUDING TO IF YOU HAVE REALLY DENSE TREES ALL WITH THE CROWNS TOUCHING EACH OTHER. WHEN THE SNOW COMES DOWN IN THE WINTER TIME IT STAYS IN THE TOPS OF THE CROWNS? SOME OF IT MELTS AND GETS DOWN INTO THE GROUND BUT A LOT OF IT SUBLIMATES WHICH MEANS IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT FROM THE SNOW STAGE. BACK TO WATER VAPOR IN THE ATMOSPHERE YOU LOSE ALL THAT WATER. AND AS BEST AS WE CAN TELL YOU PROBABLY INCREASE WATER YIELDS OUT OF THE SYSTEMS BY 10220%. BY HAVING SOME OF THESE OPENINGS SO THAT ALL THE SNOW ENDS UP DOWN ON THE GROUND RATHER THAN STUCK UP IN THE TOPS OF THE TREES. YOU CAN HAVE THE OPENINGS TO BIG YOU CAN HAVE MASSIVE CLEAR CUTS. BECAUSE THEN ALL THE SUN COMES AND IT MELTS THE WATER AND BASICALLY FLUSHES -- THE SYSTEM WITHOUT A STORAGE ABILITY. SO YOU NEED THIS KIND OF PATTERN AND THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THE PATTERN AND THE ARE KIND OF UNDERSTANDING RESILIENCE TO PRODUCE THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS. FUTURE NOT ONLY GONNA MAKE THE FORCE MORE RE. YOUR PRODUCE MORE WATER COMING OUT OF THE END OF IT. END YOUR INCREASE THE STORAGE CAPACITY BECAUSE MORE THAT WATER IS STAYING AS SNOW. RATHER THAN JUST ENDING UP AS BEING FLUSHED DOWN THE SYSTEM WHEN IT MELTS OUT DUE TO THE SUNLIGHT. SO IT'S JUST IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE BUT IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY WORKED AT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. HOW TO MAKE THE SYSTEMS SYNERGISTICALLY BENEFITING? FIRE RESILIENCE DROUGHT RESILIENCE AND WATER THROUGH PUT AT THE SAME TIME. AND I THINK WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS STUFF NOW BECAUSE WERE REALLY FOCUS LAST ON TIMBER PRODUCTION AND MORE ON MAKING THE FOREST ABLE TO WITHSTAND THESE TYPES OF CONDITIONS. SO HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD IN SOME OF THESE THINGS. I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS IS THAT OUR RESPONSE SO FAR PARTICULARLY TO WILDFIRE. AND ALSO FRANKLY TO DROUGHT HAS BEEN A VERY REACTIVE RESPONSE. WE'RE SITTING THERE TRYING TO PUT ALL THE WILDFIRES OUT WHEN THEY COME ALONG. AND BASICALLY WE'RE NEVER GOING TO WIN THAT GAME. WE KNOW THE FIRES GET WORSE THE FUELS KEEP ON BUILDING. WE HAVE TO START WORKING WITH FIRE RATHER THAN ALWAYS SUPPRESSING IT. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF FUNDAMENTALLY RIGHT AT THE CRUX OF THIS. IS ONCE WE REALIZED THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING TO IT'S INEVITABLE. WE HAVE TWO CHOICES WE CAN EITHER CONTINUE THE ROUTE WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WHICH FRANKLY THE FIRES KIND OF KICKING OUR OR WE CAN GET OUT THERE IN FRONT OF IT AND TRY TO BE THE ELEMENT THE PUTS THE FIRE MORE ON THE LANDSCAPE. WHEN THE WEATHER PATTERNS IN THE WIND IS GOING TO MOVE THE SMOKE AWAY FROM PEOPLE WE HAVE BETTER CONTROL OVER THE FIRE BURNING AT THE RIGHT TIME TO THE TENT CITY? SO THAT IMPROVES THE HEALTH OF THE FOREST. AND WERE THE ELEMENT OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY DETERMINING WHEN AND WHERE THE FIRE WORKERS TO MAKE ECOLOGICALLY BENEFICIAL. RIGHT NOW ABOUT 90% OF OUR FIRES ARE NOT ECOLOGICALLY BENEFICIAL AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY COULD CHANGE HAS TRIED TO PROACTIVELY GET OUT THERE FRONT OF IT. FINALLY ONE OF THE THINGS YOU PROBABLY HEARD A BUNCH OF ABOUT BECAUSE THIS IS IS A FAVORITE. DISCUSSION OF OF POLITICIANS IS PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU REALLY CAN'T GET MORE FIRE OUT ON THAT LANDSCAPE. IN A STATE WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO TOLERATE THAT AMOUNT OF SMOKE THAT'S GOING ON THERE YOU CAN HAVE TO THINK YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND I GET KIND OF TIRED OF THIS DEBATE BECAUSE IT WAS REYES ONE TIME TO ME AND I RAN ALL THE NUMBERS AND I WROTE A PAPER ON THIS. AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YOU CANNOT SEND YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. THINNING IS HELPFUL IS VERY USEFUL DONE IN THE RIGHT PLACE YOU CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD. BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO START WORKING WITH AND SO THOSE TWO THINGS HAVE TO GO TOGETHER AND RATHER THAN NATTERING EACH OTHER ABOUT -- WE CAN IN OUR WAY OUT -- WE CAN BURN OUR WAY OUT FRANKLY NO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN ALL THE TOOLS WE CAN TO REALLY BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE FOREST. SO FINALLY. WHAT KIND OF THINGS MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP IN TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR WHAT'S GOING ON? CERTAINLY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT WOULD CHANGE OUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH AND USE FIRE. WOULD BE TO RETHINK OUR AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS AND HOW AT PRESENT THEY ACTUALLY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO BE THE ELEMENTS. OF PUTTING FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE. AND PART OF THE PROBLEM THERE IS. THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE OUT IN THE FOREST. NOT WHEN IT'S ALL COVERED WITH SNOW. IN THE SUMMERTIME LOOK DOWN WHAT YOU'RE WALKING AROUND ON IT'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LEAF LITTER AND BRANCHES AND SO FORTH AND YOU THINK. WOW THAT'S FUEL BUT IT'S NOT ALONE FUEL THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY WALKING AROUND ON IS SMOKE. ITS SMOKE THAT IS WAITING TO HAPPEN. AND ALTHOUGH THAT LEAF LITTER AND BRANCHES KONDIK HEY. IT'S COMING IN EVEN FASTER FROM THE TREES AND IT IS DECAYING OUT THE OTHER WAY SO YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST THAT LEVEL SMOKY YOU'RE WALKING AROUND ON AND THE LONGER YOU DELAY PUTTING FIRE INTO THE SYSTEM. THE MORE SMOKE YOU'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO PRODUCE. YOU CAN HAVE THAT SMOKE HAPPEN LIKE INTO RIMFIRE EVENT WE'RE ALL GOES UP AND GETS DUMPED ON RENO AND EXPOSES THINK WE CALCULATED SEVEN MILLION PERSON DAY'S WORTH OF EXPOSURE DURING THAT KIND OF FIRE EVENT. OR AGAIN WE CAN BE THE ELEMENTS PUTTING THE FIRE OUT ON THEIR WHEN THE CONDITIONS LOFT THAT SMOKE WAY UP AWAY FROM PEOPLE OR TAKE IT AWAY FROM URBAN AREAS. AND THE CALCULATION WE ESTIMATED IS YOU WOULD HAVE LESS THAN ONE SEVEN THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THE WOOD BY WALKING AWAY WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING AND LETTING THE RIMFIRE EVENT TAKE ALL THAT LEAFLET HER. AND PUT ALL THAT SMOKE INTO THE AIR AT THAT TYPE OF TIME. SAYS ONE EXAMPLE BUT I THINK THAT IF WE GET MORE PROACTIVE ABOUT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM. AND WE START BEING SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF MAKING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF FOREST'S HAPPEN. WE CAN BENEFIT WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY CARBON STORAGE. FOREST'S RESILIENCE WILDFIRE. AND BENEFIT AND RESTORE THE FOREST'S WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. WE WANT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MYSTERIES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. COM JUST ONE WHEN THE MAP WAS PUT UP -- MS WEBERN. OF CALIFORNIA. AND BOTTOM IT SHOWED THE GLASS TWENTY ONE MILLION OF WHO TO GET THAT WHO WHO. THERE THE DRINKING WATER WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO ORGAN OR NEW YORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TOP WHERE THE WATER'S COMING TO WHERE THE END. THE END IS IS MUCH SHORTER HERE YOU YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE LOT MORE THE SPACE IT'S THAT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH. OF YOU HAVE BEEN UNDER THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT. THE DOWNSTREAM BENEFICIARIES. THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE -- AND TO JUST JUST A WE WERE HEARING ABOUT WATER IN BEVERLY HILLS VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS -- SO FIGURING OUT DUTY YOU YOU CAN'T EVEN BAY THAN SOME OF THIS WATER SO THAT THE PROBLEM IS MUCH BIGGER BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TOPIC FOR TODAY'S WILD FIRES AND AND MAKING SURE THAT WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE PROTECT THE WATERSHED THAT WE PROTECT THE THE LAND AND OF THAT THE ERROR THAT WE ALL BREATHE. I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT THE IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN. THAN WHAT WE SOMETIMES THINK AND YOU WE DO HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND LOOK AT THE BOX WE USED TO HAVE YOU KNOW. NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAD THEIR WAY OF DOING THINGS AND MAYBE WE NEED TO GO BACK TO SOME OF WHAT. WAS DONE DURING THAT TIME WITH CONTROLLED BURNS AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE DONE. COULD I JUST MENTION THAT I THINK -- YOUR POINT IS SO WELL TAKEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT INNER CITY LOS ANGELES. THE MOST RELIABLE AND CHEAPEST WATER. IS WHAT'S COMING FROM THE NORTH STATE. THROUGH THE STATE AND WATER SYSTEM SO THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WE OFTEN KNOW OR FEEL OR SEE. AND THE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE IN THE WATERSHEDS. FOR EXAMPLE AROUND REGULAR INFLOW. INTO THOSE HOLDING SYSTEMS THAT ARE THE RESERVOIRS ON THAT PIPES AND CANALS THAT WE THINK OF AS THE WATER SYSTEM. HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. YES THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- MALCOLM YOU YOU SAID THAT WHY YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE THE LAST FOR CENTER BUTI THINK IT WAS JUST A GOOD BOOK AND I WE WERE CARRYING ABOUT THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE AND WE HAVE INCREASE ARE PRESCRIBED FIRES. WE ARE WORKING ON X. WITH ANYTHING THINNING IN TRYING TO USE AS MANY TOOLS AND THAT COLLABORATION. I THINK YOU BOOK AND THAT IT TO REMIND US WHY WE'RE DOING IT AND WHERE WE NEED TO KEEP DOING ANY% TYPE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON THE WORK THAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING. OUT THERE AND SAY I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELS THAT CAME OUT TO SEE -- PERCENT TODAY UNDER DISCUSSION THAT'S THAT'S ON PORT AND NOT JUST FOR THE NORTH SEA BUT FOR THE WHOLE STATE AND THAT INTER CONNECTED. EIGHTY AS THE TWO LEFT THE REFLECTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA HERE -- IT IS A GOOD REMINDER TO US WHEN WE GO BACK THERE I AND IT'S UP THERE BECAUSE WE NEED IT DOWN THERE ALSO -- INTO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME I AND EVERYONE AT TESTIFIED TODAY. LEDGER -- I'VE SORRY ACTUALLY YES PUBLIC COMMENTS. I WOULD. ASK US ALL TO BE AS BRIEF AND CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE TO BE OUT HERE AND EIGHT MINUTES. A GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THING THANKS FOR THIS AWESOME DISCUSSION -- THE WHICH IS VERY INFORMATIVE TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND FOLKS FROM FROM THE STATE THAT WERE ABLE TO PRESENT -- FEDERAL KNOW ME HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY WANTED TO TO MENTION YOU KNOW AS THE ECOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE BEING DEVELOPED. YOU KNOW SEE IN PS IS BEEN TAKING A DEEP DIVE INTO THE WEEDS. ON REGULATIONS AS IT RELATES TO EIGHTY FORTY NINETY TWO IMPLEMENTATION FOR TIMBERLANDS IN IN CALIFORNIA -- WHAT ONE OF THE? ONE OF THE CORE -- PREMISES ANY TO BE ADDRESSED IS ACCESS TO TO GOOD RELIABLE DATA. ON WHAT'S OUT THERE CURRENTLY ON THE FORCE LANCE EDGE ON SPECIALLY FROM THINKING WITH THE SUB THREE HAD ON ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH RESOURCES CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP THAT DATA. IN OUR FORCE LINES -- AND THEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA URBAN SPRING STREAMS PARTNERSHIP AND THE CALIFORNIA WHAT SHOULD NETWORK. WANTED TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT -- CAYLEY'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE BENEFITS OF THE WATCH ACCORDING TO PROGRAM -- SPECIALLY AT BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE REGIONAL APPROACH -- AND AND WORK ON MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOCAL LEVEL -- APPROACHES. TO ENSURING THAT OUR WATERSHEDS AND ECOSYSTEMS ARE A RESILIENT ESPECIALLY IN IN LIGHT OF ALL THE CHANGES THAT OUR STATE IS IS AN ARE GOING -- SO LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW BUT THINK YOU'LL APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY COMING. ONE OF THE MEAT ON A WITHOUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA WE AYE WE WANNA ECHO -- THE SAME COMMENTS -- FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND AND SO THE INVESTING AND THE NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SAID. IN A RELATED TO CLEAN WATER BUT ALSO -- THE AMOUNT OF A CO BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH WILDLIFE. IN -- BENEFITS THAT. BE A HEALTHY -- WATERSHED TAB SO THANK YOU. HI ANNELIES ROAD DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AYE WE'VE THREE BRIEF SUGGESTIONS THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE -- WE RECOMMEND THAT STATE EXPAND ITS FOCUS FOR RESTORATION PLANNING AND FUNDING PRIORITIZE THE SOUTHERN SIERRA. TO ENSURE THAT THE SOUTHERN TIER WATERSHEDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN SNOW PACK LATER IN PROVIDE IMPORTANT WATER RETENTION SOME STORAGE FOR CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION TO THE NORTHERN ONES AS WELL OF COURSE -- WE URGENT INCREASE SUPPORT FOR THE AT LOCAL REGIONAL EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE USE OF GETTING MORE FIRE ON THE GROUND FOR FOREST RESTORATION EFFORTS AS WE HEARD TODAY WE NEED. TO GET FIRE BACK INTO THE ECOSYSTEM -- ESPECIALLY SINCE FIRES WERE ONLY RESTORATION AND SCAPES DUE TO TOMOGRAPHIC ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS. OF FINALLY THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN PROVIDED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO DR A FUNDS TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. FOR ONE CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROJECTS THAT CONSERVE NATURAL WORKING LANCE RELEASED FIFTY YEARS. FOR THE BENEFIT OF CRIME ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE WILDLIFE AND TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT. NATURAL WORKING LANDS ADAPTATION RESILIENCY PLANNING THE PRIORITIZE THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL WORKING LANDS PROVIDES ASSISTANCE FOR NETWORKING AND MANAGERS AND SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE. RURAL URBAN COORDINATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN A WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS PANEL A TO THE COMMITTEES -- I DON'T THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH ALL OF THE SPECIFICS AND DETAILS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY BUT I AM. VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE'RE FINALLY TO SEE THIS DISCUSSION WERE DIGGING INTO THIS ASPECT OF THE ISSUE -- I THINK THE TALKING ABOUT THE LARGE SCALE PLANNING. AND WILDLIFE IMPACTS AS WELL AS THE THE THE ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF OUR DISCUSSION IN FACT CONTINUES.IN MANY WAYS TO BE LEFT OUT BECAUSE SO OFTEN ARE FUNDING AND OUR ACTION ON THIS IS DRIVEN BY THE CRISES WHEN COMMUNITIES HOMES AND LIVES ARE THREATENED. AND ON THAT I WANT TO I WANT TO THE END AND THE SPEAKERS TODAY IS LIKE I FELT LIKE IT WAS IMPLICIT BUT THAT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN ALL OF THE WORK AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINKING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OUT IN THE FOREST. VERSES THE PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR COMMUNITIES. HOUSES AND LIVES THAT THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH SEPARATELY AND AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND BIOMASS UTILIZATION CAME UP A FEW TIMES TODAY. AND I JUST WANTED -- TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING NANI MISSION BIOMASS UTILIZATION. AND SHOULD ALWAYS PRIORITIZE -- ECOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FIRST THAT. WE DON'T CREATE MORE OF A DEMAND. FOR WHAT THEN A PARTICULAR AREA CAN SUPPLY IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AS WE'RE TRYING. TO SEQUESTER CARBON ON AYE LANDSCAPE. PRESS TO REMOVE TRAYS AND THEN BURN THEM AND PAUL HUGHES WITH FORCED FOREVER -- WE FEEL GENERALLY VERY GOOD ABOUT THE INCOMING NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION IN THE HOPE IT HOLDS. FOR GOOD POLICY ON WILD FIRE RESILIENCE AND WATERSHED HEALTH. ARE SPECIALLY SUPPORTIVE OF CONTROLLED BURNING -- AND WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT OUT BUT WERE SKEPTICAL OF THE EFFORTS TO REMOVE. DEAD TREES EITHER IN THE FORM OF PRE FIRE OR POST FIRE SALVAGE LOGGING PROGRAMS. THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT A INCREASING AND VERY LARGE GROWING UP BODY OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT SNACK FORESTS ARE GENERALLY LESS FLAMMABLE. THAN GREEN TREES THE FINE FUELS AND VOLATILE OILS DISAPPEAR FAIRLY QUICKLY AFTER THE TREES DIE. AND THOSE FOREST'S SPEC FORESTER UNDER REPRESENTED HISTORICALLY AND IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY RIVAL OLD GROWTH TREES ARE NOT THE ENEMY. HARDENING HOMES IS WHERE THE ACTION IS AT THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WERE SUPPORTING THAT. YOU'LL BE SEEING SOON WE HOPE ARE ONE IS US SENATE BILL NINE NO ONE CLEAN UP -- WE FEEL IT WAS ENACTED IN HASTE. A AND NEEDS MORE ATTENTION TO THE MAXIMUM DIAMETER TREES THAT CAN BE REMOVED WITH A NOTICE OF INTENT EMERGENCY HARVEST NOTICE OF INTENT. A AM TO CAL FIRE RUDIMENTARY INSPECTIONS OF THOSE. OF ENOUGH OPERATIONS NEED TO BE PUT BACK IN PLACE. AND THE SECOND BIGGER ONE IS THAT THERE IS A CONFLICT WITHIN THE AGENCY RIGHT NOW CAL FIRE. IT'S 90% THE FIREFIGHTING AGENCY ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST AND BEST WE APPLAUD THAT WANT TO SEE THAT ROLE EXPANDED. BUT THERE'S LITTLE QUESTION NOW THAT IT IS DOING A THE SAFEGUARDING OUR PUBLIC TRUST VALUES. QUALITY WILDLIFE AND SO ON AT ROUTE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN ITS FORESTRY THAT IS TIMBER HARVEST REGULATION. AND FIREFIGHTING FUNCTIONS FORESTERS ARE TAKEN OFF LINE FROM THEIR FORESTRY DUTIES WHEN CALLED TO FIGHT FIRES WHICH IS ALMOST CONSTANT NOW. AND THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN SEPARATING THOSE TWO FUNCTIONS.% AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO CALLS FOR MORE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. IN REGULATING LOGGING WE FEEL THAT SEPARATION WOULD DO THAT. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT SAID THAT MORE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN AGENCIES. ESPECIALLY IN NATURAL RESOURCES IS NEEDED. OUGHT TO SAFEGUARD PUBLIC TRUST VALUES IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT DO IT ALONE. SO WE NEED TO CONSOLIDATE CAL FIRES OF ACTIVITIES AROUND ITS CORE MISSION OF FIRE FIGHTING -- LET FIREFIGHTERS DO WHAT THEY DO BETTER WITH LESS INTERFERENCE FROM. OF FORESTERS WHO ARE LESS TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED A LOT FORESTERS DO THEIR PARAMOUNT WE IMPORTANT JOB OF REGULATING THE END GREENHOUSE SEA QUEST STAY TUNED. CURRENTLY ON BACK AUTHORED A LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU THERE'S NO MORE FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT THANK EVERYONE WHO ATTENDED TODAY WE WILL BE ADJOURNING
