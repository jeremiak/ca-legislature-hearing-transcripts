OBVIOUSLY POLICE REFORM AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ARE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER HATE CRIMES ARE ON THE RISE ESPECIALLY THOSE TARGETING MEMBERS OF THE AAPI COMMUNITY ASSAULTS ARE BEING CONTINUALLY LAUNCHED ON OUR RIGHTS.

MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN RECRUITED TO HELP FILIPINO AND LATINO FARM WORKER. WORKERS ADVOCATE FOR BETTER WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS. AND THEY WORK ALONGSIDE LAURA SWETA SAID THERE CHAVEZ AND PHILIP VERACRUZ. MOST ALL WHAT HAS STUCK WITH ME ARE THE LESSONS ABOUT A QUALITY THAT LA PAZ TAUGHT ME. IN THE DIDN'T MATTER IF YOU DATA SAID SETS JOB IS. FOR MIGRANT FARMWORKER. IT DIDN'T MATTER YOU'RE A FILIPINO. CHICANO BLACK OR WHITE EVERYONE SAW IN IN THE- AND WANTED IT. OUR FAMILY LET THE PAST WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR MY- AND ME. TO START SCHOOL BUT THOSE EARLY LOW DON. THAT AN INJUSTICE A ONE. IS AN AND JUST AGAINST ALL ITS WIDEST TO BECOME A ATTORNEY THE FOR THOSE WHO ARE BEEN WRONG WE'RE SCARED FOR HER WHO ARE MISTREATED AND NEEDED SOMEONE TO FOR THEM. AND IT'S NOT FOR JUSTICE ALL CAL. THAT MOTIVATES ME TODAY. AFTER GRADUATING FROM LOS AND SPENDING A TIME AND PRACTICE. I DECIDED TO PRACTICE THE P. FULL TIME. JOINING THE SAN FRANCISCO. CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. BY THE DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY FOR NEARLY A DECADE. BEFORE ULTIMATELY JOINING YOU ALL IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. FOR THE PAST EIGHT PLUS YEARS I'VE BEEN EXCITED TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY I HIT THE GROUND RUNNING WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE. AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. I'VE BEEN PROUD TO PARTNER WITH EACH OF YOU TO PASS A NUMBER. OF BIG REFORMS AND TO RIGHT HISTORIC WRONGS. TO REPAIR A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO TAKE ON BIG POLLUTERS. AND TO PROTECT RENTERS HOMEOWNERS CONSUMERS. AND WORKERS. I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE AND ARE DOING TO COMBAT HATRED AND HELP VICTIMS OF HATE CRIME SO IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED LEADERS WHO WILL BUILD BRIDGES. WITH THOSE HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED OTHER THAN AND TARGETED THAT WILL BE ONE OF MY FIRST PRIORITIES IF I HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE. OF BEING CONFIRMED AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE TARGETED BY THE FORCES OF HATE. ARE PROTECTED AND THAT THOSE WHO USE HATE VIOLENCE. ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. STRENGTHENING OUR OUR DEFENSES AGAINST HATE ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM WE FACE. THERE ARE STILL TOO MANY WHO ARE WRONG IN CALIFORNIA. TOO MANY COULD BECOME VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING. ABUSE AND MISTREATMENT TOO MANY WHO ARE TREATED UNFAIRLY BY THE MANY BROKEN PARTS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND DESERVE MORE JUSTICE. MORE HUMANITY. AND A SECOND CHANCE. TOO MANY WHO'VE BEEN CHEATED BY BIG CORPORATIONS OR LIED TO. AS PART OF AN ORGANIZED SCAM. OR FRAUD. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THESE FIGHTS CALIFORNIANS FIGHTS WILL BE MY FIGHTS. I KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES FACING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUT I'M ALSO KEENLY AWARE OF THE DEDICATION OF THE CAREER STAFF IN THE TREMENDOUSWORK THAT IS DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT. EVERY DAY. THESE ARE SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST LEGAL MINDS IN HARD TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA DOJ MUST BE AN ORGANIZATION THAT IF USES MORE JUSTICE. FOR HUMANITY. MORE FAIRNESS. AND MORE SAFE. INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS. I HOPE TO FURTHER ADVANCE THOSE EFFORTS AND SOLIDIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S REPUTATION. AS A NATIONAL VANGUARD FOR REFORM. THE FACT THAT THEY YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'M GOING TO LOOK AND SEE IF MY VICE CHAIRMAN WOULD LIKE TO KICK US OFF. LET ME CORRECT THAT I DON'T OFFICE ADVISED IF I DID I MEAN MY CHAIR. I CATCH IT HI I'M I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MY HEAD. I SENATOR A Q. WELL I WELCOME IN MEMBER OF BY SEEM TO BE I MISSING NOT MISTER TURNING GENERAL- WE HAD A- GOOD CALL. YESTERDAY ON A CO OF AYE THAT CHILD WERE ON. I THINK PRIORITY ME ON HAND TO. AND DON'T ENJOY DOING YOU FOLLOW THE CA. BUT I DID MANAGE THAT I LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THOSE ON THE IN THE- FORUM ONE THE- OF. AND I DID MANAGE THAT IN NOW TO EIGHTEEN SENATE NIELSEN AND I AM WITH. ATTORNEY TO SERRA TIMES. OVER FAILURE ABOUT ARE ABLE GROWING OUT OF THE BACK IS GROWING. A TO THIRTEEN ON THINK WE'RE OUT AND ABOUT TWENTY THREE THEN ON THE SIGNAL AMOUNT OF AND ACTUALLY TO DO THERE ARE SOME. CLOSE TO MILLION DOLLAR SITTING CAN PUT FORWARD FOR THAT PROGRAM TO RAINY AND NOW THE WHO ARE DETERMINED TO- YOU KNOW DANGEROUS. AND THEREFORE NOT SHOULD NOT HAVE- A MONTH THAT THEY RAINY- IN ON TEN THOUSAND CASES PLUS AMOUNTS COME BACK ONTO THE REGISTER SO THERE'S A COMMUNITY. ISSUE TOO WITH THE GUN SHOP SO. CERTAINLY THE GUN SHOW AND HAD. THE WAY TO TRAP THESE. SO I. UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S HAS TO BE A PLAN. AND ASSIST FROM THE- FINANCE- TO ACTUALLY DO THE- BECAUSE IT'S GROWN AND ARE CALM. REMEMBER WHAT ABOUT OF THEM SHOOTING THAT WE'VE ON THE PERPETRATOR OF THOSE ARE CLEAR CLASSIFIED AS THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT. HAVE ANY POSSESSION OF WEAPONS% SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GIVEN YOU KNOW ON A LICENSE FOR THAT UNIT HAD HAD ONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND ALSO THEIR GUNS. ARE POSSESSED. BY THE STATE SO LET'S BEGIN WITHOUT BECAUSE ME THAT'S BEEN A TOP PRIORITY THE WAY BACK TO WHEN I FIRST. ARRIVED THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR AND ME START BY SAYING. THAT I APPRECIATED THAT THE- THAT HAD AND- ON THIS ISSUE. NO ONE SHOULD FEEL GONE BY. WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL THEY WORK WHERE THEY- CAN. GUN VIOLENCE IS AMERICA'S DISEASE IF SIXTEEN WITH THROUGH AND WE'VE- BLOEMEN. TOO MANY MASS SHOOTINGS AN THEY ARE PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM ONE AREA WHERE- ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEEN A LOT OF BY SUPPORT. CAN IT'S AN AREA WHERE. I WANT WHAT YOU WANT. WHAT WE ALL WHICH IS TO READ THE NUMBER OF CASES ACTIVE CASES ON THE APPS SYSTEM. AS QUICKLY AND AS ACCURATELY AND THOROUGHLY AS POSSIBLE. AND IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU SAID THAT THE- OPS THE DATABASE IS DYNAMIC IT'S NOT STATIC- THERE'S TEN THOUSAND NEW CASES THAT COME IN PER YEAR I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE SAID FOR MONTHS I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT IT IS PER YEAR. AND ON AVERAGE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ACTIVE CASES THAT ARE CLEARED FOR YEARS WHILE THE HERO SAY WAS A SLOWER YEAR- THE STATURE BECAUSE OF CALVET THAT THE WAY THAT THE CASE IS CLEARED IS YOU ACTUALLY IDENTIFY LOCATION WHERE SOMEONE IS KNOWN TO HAVE A- A WEAPON I BASED ON THE DATA THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE ETFE KNOCK ON THE DOOR MAKE A VISIT AND TRY TO REMOVE THOSE WEAPONS FROM THAT PERSON. SO THESE ARE THESE ARE IN PERSON CONGREGATE- ACTIONS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY COLD. WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES- THE GENEROUS BY. THE PROPOSAL AND ALLOCATE THAT WERE GIVE TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF. AND ONE OF THEM ARE PARKED. IT IT'S A- NOT AS AS FLUENT AND AS FLUID AND A- EASY USE AS IT SHOULD A LITTLE PUNK TO BE A- AND EVER. MANUAL AT TIMES AND WE CAN'T CALL UP THE DATA AND IF A QUICK ENTITIES AS WE LIE. TOM AND SO WE GOT AN FROM THAT LETTER TO. IMPROVE THAT WANT TO WORK PHASE TWO TO CONTINUE TO MAKE A IMPROVEMENT WE ALSO NEED HAVE SPECIAL AGE WHO IMPLEMENT- THESE AND REMOVE THE GUNS OUT OF WHO ARE ON THE LESS. AND WE HAVE SOME VACANCIES WE NEED MAKE SURE WE ATTRACT AND RETAIN. WELL TRAINED EIGHT TO DO JOB SO THOSE ARE SORT OF INTO CAL THAT I BE HONORED WORK WITH YOU ON- I THIS IS BEEN A HIT AND ISSUE OF IN FOR ME AS IT BEEN FOR YOU SENATOR BATES- SINCE THE DAY I GOT HERE I WAS ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE. AND A MONTH AFTER MY DUE TO CANNOT HAPPEN. SENATE BILL SCHOOL. TRAGIC TERRA MATCH. AND AT THAT. THERE WAS A SCENE. INVEST INTO. THE APPS BROKE THAT LED TO. MAY. THE BACKLOG AT THE TIME WE AFTER REMOVED THREE YEARS LATER AS A- AT AND- WAS A PURPOSE ACCORDING TO A AUDITOR SO. FOR ME PROGRESS WE ARE RE. ACTIVE MEMBER- NAY FROM THE APPS LESS BY IT CONTINUES TO GROW AND I WANTED TO BE ALL TO DO IT MORE QUICKLY ACT. I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IT THE AND ABOUT THE HONOR IMPROVE OF SERVING SIX AS A TURN GENERAL I LIKE TO WORK THOSE AND LEGISLATURE LIKE YOURSELF IF YOU WILLING OTHER. HEY WE HAVE A TASK I THINK WE CAN REALLY WELL TOGETHER DELAY THE GENERAL OFFICE TECH TO GET UPDATES. SANTA BE FOUGHT PARTNERS ON HOW TO GET WILL BE WANT WHICH IS THE QUICKEST REDUCTION THAT THAT WE CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND CAL. THOSE ARE NOT THE ESSENCE IS ME EIGHTY A YEAR. IF IT WAS EVERY MAN I THINK YEAH. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT. WE DO HAVE THE ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PRISON SHUTTING DOWN- MORE- CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE ARE PROBABLY YOU KNOW. ALMOST THEIR. INTERESTS THEIR TRAINING THE BACKGROUND CHECKS. HOW WOULD YOU CAN. DOING. RECRUITMENT TO ENSURE THAT GROUP. AS. GRAHAM SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CONVINCED THAT BY ADDING STAFF AND HAVING THE ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW A REALLY RAMP UP CAN BE ROLLED US WHICH IS REALLY NEEDED. THAT THAT WOULD BE PART OF YOUR PLAN GOING FORWARD. MR WITH SECOND PART YOUR QUESTION FIRST AND THAT IS I AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE. THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S BURDEN RESPONSIBILITY TO DEMONSTRATE WHY INVESTMENTS WILL ADD VALUE. AND THAT IF MONIES GIVEN BY THE LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR- THE NEEDLE NEEDLE WILL BE MOVED PROGRESS WILL BE MADE- I OWE THAT TO YOU IF I CAN I HAVE THE HONOR PRIVILEGE OF BEING ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ASK FOR MORE MONEY. AND I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON PATHWAYS ABOUT HOW TO GET THERE YOUR IDEA I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT IDEA TO CONSIDER FOR HOW TO FILL THE VACANCY RATE THERE'S PROBABLY OTHER IDEAS OUT THERE AS WELL- I DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN- YOU KNOW IF WE'VE HAD DIVERT THE RETENTION. AND ATTRACTION CHILD FOR SOME TIME AND IT A LITTLE BIT OF IT IS- INSTITUTIONAL. IN TERMS OF BEING COMPETITIVE. SO YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ATTRACT FOLKS TO COME INTO THOSE POSITIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN'T JUST BE ANYBODY HAS TO BE THE RIGHT PERSON WITH THE RIGHT SKILL SET WITH THE RIGHT TALENTS TO GET THIS JOB DONE RIGHT. SAFELY AND- THOROUGHLY SO. I'M OPEN TO IDEAS AND OTHERS- BUT- THANK YOU FOR AGREEING THAT THE VACANCY RATE IS A CHALLENGE. THERE IS CONCERN FROM OUR SECOND AMENDMENT ADVOCATES ALSO THAT A LOT OF THE FOLKS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ON GUN CONTROL NOT RECOGNIZING THAT MANY MOST PEOPLE WITHHOLD FONG MAYBE THE 55% A MEASURE THE 2% ON A BELL CURVE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE THE WORST ONES WE HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING THEIR GUNS. ILLEGALLY ANYWAY AND THEN YOU ADD THOSE TO THOSE FOLKS THAT DO HAVE THESE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HUGE PROBLEM SO WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE WHO ARE LAW ABIDING YOU KNOW GUN OWNERS WHO ARE FEEL THAT THERE'S A REAL ATTACK ON THEIR RIGHT FOR SELF PROTECTION AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE HAD YOUR MOMENT ALREADY WITH THOSE ISSUES BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE IT ON THE RECORD AND I KNOW MY- COLLEAGUE SENATOR- GROUP WILL BE HERE SHORTLY WILL. PROBABLY I WANT TO HAVE. A LITTLE MORE EXPLANATION ON THAT. THANK YOU THE QUESTION. I BELIEVE IN IN COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETY POLICIES THAT MAKE US SAFER I HAVE NO PROBLEM A QUARREL WITH. THOSE WHO RESPONSIBLY OWN GUNS FOR SELF DEFENSE OR FOR SPORTING OR HUNTING- BLOOD THAT IS NOT MY FOCUS MY FOCUS IS ON THOSE WHO WILL DO HARM- DOWN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASS SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN LIVES OF OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS AND- THOSE ACROSS. ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND MY FOCUS IS ON ENDING WITH A EARLIER DESCRIBED AS AMERICA'S DISEASE- THEN REDUCING THE DEATH AND THE HURT THAT COMES FROM FROM GUN VIOLENCE SENATE THANK I ABSOLUTELY THINK. THAT YOU CAN DO BOTH AND I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTIVE OF COMMONSENSE- TEN FIFTY POLICIES IS NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THAT. AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT NOT TRUE- YOU CAN HONOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT AS I DO AND ALSO BE IN SUPPORT OF COMMONSENSE. GUN SAFETY POLICIES I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT LET ME MOVE TO ANOTHER AREA THAT'S OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO MIND TO ME AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED JOBS SINCE I'VE BEEN THE LEGISLATURE WITH. THE INCREASE IN THE OPIOID USE AND- THE ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE I'VE HAD A BILL- BEFORE THE- LEGISLATURE A COUPLE OF SESSIONS ON FAT NOW TO HAVE THE EDGE BASICALLY- IT'S OFFENSE ENHANCEMENT WHICH IS NOT POPULAR I LOOK AT IT IN A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT IS JUST ADDING FENTANYL TO. TO DRUGS OF WHICH IS COOKING. COCAINE AND TEARAWAY. WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO NOT HER ONE IS ONE COCAINE A SCHEDULE TO BUT DO HAVE SEVERE PENALTY FOR LOW QUANTITIES THAT ARE IMPORTED AND- PRODUCED AND IMPORTED ON BY. LET'S SAY THE CURTAILS. HANDLE WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE OF- THE HOBBIT NOW BEING LISTED ON THE SCHEDULE ONE DRUGS WRITE A LETTER OF SUPPORT ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO. DEAL COORDINATE WITH A AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHEN WE GET THERE WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A MORE. UNITED NOW NATIONAL A DEFENSE AGAINST THIS POISON AND IT IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY VERY AWARE OF HOW LEGAL IT IS. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO AS WE SEE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING DECEIVED- THAT UNFORTUNATELY THERE IN. TO THE DRUG CULTURE AND GETTING HIGH. ON OPIATES NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE ARE NOW FENTANYL PILLS THAT KILL THEM PRETTY INSTANTLY NOW TO MINNESOTA RESTORATION SHUTS DOWN IF YOU HAVE FOUND NOW. SO. GIVE ME SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT. FOR THE- BOB YOU ARE THE APPLE HAS HURT TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS IN TOO MANY PROFITS NATION AND- RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS WORKING WITH OTHER STATES OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. ON. A POTENTIAL NATIONWIDE- OR MULTI JURISDICTIONAL SETTLEMENT FIVE TO HELP BRING ACCOUNTABILITY AND BRING INVESTMENTS INTO MITIGATION STRATEGIES ANTI DETECTION PREVENTION- STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WILL ADDRESS THE VERY ISSUE THAT YOU'VE JUST RAISED. I THINK THAT ADDICTION DRUG ADDICTION- SHOULD SHOULD GENERALLY. BE RESPONDED TO WITH WITH CARE. AND COMPASSION AND PROGRAMS- CHEN AND NOT WITH MORE CRIMINALIZATION- BUT I WILL I HAVE NOT LOOK AT YOUR BILL FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF IT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK INTO MORE CLOSELY WITH SOME OF THE EXPERTS AT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH THEM AS THEIR ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THINK MORE ABOUT IT IN AND SHARE SOME MORE THOUGHTS I WILL SAY THAT. ONE UNIQUE PART ABOUT MINE PATH TO THE NOMINATION IS THAT IT'S BEEN THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE IT'S BEEN SERVING WITH YOU. AND OTHER OF OUR GREAT COLLEAGUES FOR THE LAST EIGHT PLUS YEARS. I HAVE BENEFITTED TREMENDOUSLY FROM THAT BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S PASSION AREAS AND THE THINGS THAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THEIR DISTRICTS IN THE POLICY AREAS THAT DRIVE THEM. AND I HOPE TO KEEP THAT. MOVING FORWARD AND SO THAT WHEN I SAY I'M FOR TO TALKING TO YOU MORE IN THE FUTURE IF I AM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I MEAN THAT BECAUSE IT'S MY INTENT TO SEEK OUT THE EXPERTISE IN THIS BODY. AND THE PARTNERSHIP AND TOP PARTNERSHIP- TO HELP ME DO MY JOB BETTER AND HOPEFULLY FOR ALL OF US TO SERVE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I KNOW THAT SHE MADE A VERY COMPELLING. DISCRETE HAD A VERY COMPELLING DISCUSSION ON THAT OKAY YESTERDAY WHEN WE TALKED TO AND NOT NOT MEANS SO MUCH TO US BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AMONG US. IN YOU UNDERSTAND OUR FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE INTENT. AND THE GOOD BECAUSE OF OUR LEGISLATION IS SOMEHOW WHEN IT GETS WHERE IT'S GOING IT JUST DOESN'T EVER. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS IMPLEMENTED ON THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO BE AND THEN IT DOESN'T COME BACK TO US- TO KIND OF SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT SO THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. I HAVE. ONE LAST QUESTION AND I'VE BEEN INFORMED. IT WAS KIND OF CUTE. COMMENT TO ME I HAVE A- BILL THAT I'VE MADE IT TO YOUR BILL BUT IS ON ELECTION INTEGRITY SO. THE CHAIRMAN OF THAT COMMITTEE WHOSE GOOD FRIEND SAID YOU KOW THIS IS A VERY PRICKLY ISSUE YOU'VE GOT. TO AND I SAID WELL- YES WE KNOW THAT BUT ISN'T THAT OUR JOB IS TO AT LEAST RAISE THE DISCUSSION AND AWARENESS IN A IN A POSITIVE WAY AND I THINK. IT COULD BE VERY POSITIVE THAT'S GOING TO BE UNDER YOUR DIRECTORS DICTION AS THE INITIATIVE TITLE AND SUMMARY SIGNED. LEGISLATION BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I THINK A LOT OF THE ISSUES REALLY DEVELOPED ESPECIALLY ON THE PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE. BALLOT INITIATIVES TO YOU KNOW SUPPORTER. STOP WHATEVER. TOP PERCENT. OF ALL OF US HAVE AN ISSUE WITH SO. WHAT STEPS WILL YOU TAKE TO ENSURE THE PROCESS IS REALLY NOT PARTISAN. AND IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH ACCURATE TO WHAT IT'S DOING AND I WILL REFER BACK TO ONE WHERE THERE WAS TE BIG DISCUSSION ON IT WAS SB ONE THE TAX MEASURE ON GAS. IN IT REALLY- PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AFTER THEY VOTED ON IT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT THE MOST TO THE LATEST ONE IS PROP NINETEEN. ON WHETHER YOU CAN TRANSFER YOUR PROPERTY- THAT'S CURRENTLY IN A TRUST TO YOUR CHILDREN UNLESS THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE IN ONE ANYWAY. AND THAT KIND OF DISTORTED. SO I'M GETTING THE CALLS AND YOU WOULD TO. HAVE AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON WELL I DIDN'T KNOW AND SO WHAT CAN YOU DO. GOING FORWARD SO THEY DO KNOW IF THERE'S A THREE PART. IN ON THAT PARTICULAR THING THERE'S TWO EXCELLENT PARTS OF THAT BILL BUT THIS OTHER ONE. THIS CREATED ISSUES AND MORE TIME I THINK WOULD HELP. THAT OTHER PART OF IT. THAT TO LIVE WHAT WOULD YOU D TO TRY TO. YOU KNOW MAKE IT A LITTLE CLEARER. I KEEP IT STUPID SIMPLE IF THEY SAY. THAT YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE IT IS LAW BUT MAKING IT MORE INTELLIGIBLE. TO THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO READ IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. THANK YOU FOR RAISING. AS YOU NOTICE THE ROLE AS YOU SAY OR THE TURN GENERAL. PREPARE CUT ON SUMMER AND- THE RESPONSE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS TO DO THAT FAIRLY IMPARTIALLY AND TO CALL BALLS AND STRIKES IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO BE A DESCRIPTIVE- INFORMATIVE. AND ALLOW VOTERS TO KNOW WHAT THE VOTING ON. SO YOU KNOW AS YOU SAY USING WORDS THAT ARE AND TERMS AND IDEAS THAT ARE AS ACCESSIBLE AS POSSIBLE AS INFORMATIVE AS POSSIBLE THE VOTERS KNOWING. WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON THIS CAN BE IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FOR THAT I CAN COLOR PASSED THE BATON TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR CONTINUE QUESTIONING BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR SPONSON AND CERTAINLY ALL. YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF FUN THINKING ON ALL OF THIS TIME AND I THINK THAT THAT. IS A MARK OF MINISTRATION GOING FORWARD WE HOPE AND THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO SO THANKS. AND I MIGHT COME BACK AFTER. YOU KNOW WE HAVE MORE AFTER THE PUBLIC WAY SAYS. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU SENATOR- SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM CHAIR. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE- AND ALSO I POINTED OUT TO. THE DOOR I GREW UPIN VALLEJO WITH A VERY LARGEFILIPINO AMERICAN POPULATION ALL OF WHOM I THINK ARE PROBABLY VERY PROUD RIGHT NOW BUT YOUR APPOINTMENT SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I KNOW THAT PUTS AN ADDED. PRESSURE ON YOU FOR SUCCESS. OF IT BEING A TRAILBLAZER IS NOT AN EASY PLACE TO BE ALL THE TIME AND I APPRECIATE ARE YOU MEETING WITH ME AND WE HAVE A VERY THOUGHTFUL TALKED AND I THOUGHT WOULD BE GOOD TO MAYBE DRAW OUT SOME OF THE SAME TOPICS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE THAT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT MY FUNDED STARK. WITH THE FACT THAT I TALK THAT I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE NOW WITH ABOUT FIVE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. REMOVAL HAD A DIFFERENT OPERATING STYLE. OTHERS SOME OF THEM OF DECIDED HAVE BEEN TOP DOWN OF SOME SORT OF TAKE WHAT COMES FROM THE RANKS AND TEMPERED A LITTLE. THE SOME SEEM TO PUT MUCH MORE OF A POLITICAL IMPRINT ON WHAT COMES FROM THE RANKS. HOW WOULD YOU VIEW THIS JOB IN TERMS OF YOUR MANAGEMENT OR YOUR OPERATING STYLE. I THINK. PERHAPS A HYBRID OF THE DIFFERENT MODELS YOU JUST DESCRIBED AND- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AMONG ABSOLUTE INCREDIBLE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OF SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TO HAVE IN THAT ROLE- I AM DEEPLY HONORED THAT. A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE REACHED OUT TO PROVIDE FRIENDSHIP AND COUNSEL AND WISDOM. AND IT FOR ME IT IT'S A LARGE DEPARTMENT ASIAN NOW BILLION DOLLAR APARTMENT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THOUSAND ATTORNEYS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO SET A VISION. AND MAKE SURE YOUR YOUR VALUES ARE KNOWN YOUR PRIORITIES ARE CLEAR. AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD TEAM AROUND YOU TO HELP TO HELP IMPLEMENT- I ALSO YOU KNOW I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE ATTORNEYS AND THE INVESTIGATORS IN THE OFFICE AYE AYE AYE WAS ONE. IN A DIFFERENT ROLE IN THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I DID A JOB VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MANY OF THE- DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DO. SO I THINK SETTING A CLEAR VISION I WOULD PRIORITIES WHAT'S IMPORTANT WHAT'S LESS IMPORTANT AND TRUSTING THE TEAM TO IMPLEMENT- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY KNOW. THE TRUTH WHICH IS THAT I HAVE WOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEM TO IMPLEMENT THAT. AND I'M PROUD OF THEM IN THEIR WORK I THINK IT'S MERELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU THIS REVIEW REALLY HELPFUL AND IT SORT OF A LOAN AMOUNT LINES I TOLD YOU THE STORY THAT. WHEN I WAS FIRST RESOURCES SECRETARY- I HAD TO NEGOTIATE. TO TRY TO BRING NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA INTO THE MARINE PROCESS. AND WAS VERY HARD THEY WERE IN OPPOSITION IT REALLY INVOLVES CERTAIN LEGAL PRINCIPLES OF EQUAL PROTECTION. AND I GOT TO SOMEBODY IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IT WAS IN THE FIRST WEEKS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND SOMEBODY THAT NOW HAPPENS TO BE THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL AND- HOPE YOU GET A CHANCE TO WORK WITH. AND AS I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE ISSUES OF. ON THE LEGAL SIDE THERE'S EQUAL PROTECTION BROUGHT. ON THE POLICY SIDE IT'S NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES HAVE HAD HISTORIC TAKES OF FOR SUBSISTENCE FOR CEREMONIAL PURPOSES. AND IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF MARINE PROTECTION I CAN HAVE THOSE RIGHTS AND SOMEWHERE IN THE CONVERSATION HE SAID TO ME. WHAT'S THE RIGHT PUBLIC POLICY THING TO DO. AND I AS I TOLD YOU IN OUR MEETING I HAD REALLY FREQUENTLY BEEN ASKED THAT BY AN ATTORNEY. WHO WAS TRYING TO NEXT NAVIGATE TO LEGAL ISSUES. HOW WILL YOU BALANCE. WHAT YOU THINK IS ARE THE LEGAL ISSUES YOU HAVE TO AS YOU SAID CALL BALLS AND STRIKES ON. WITH WHAT THE RIGHT PUBLIC POLICY I THANK MIGHT BE. FROM GREAT QUESTION AND IT HAS YOU KNOW IT'S A U. TURN GENERAL'S AN ELECTED POSITION. IT'S FOR AN ATTORNEY- BUT BUT THERE'S ALSO A COUPLE OF POLITICAL COMPONENT TO IT. AND TO ME THAT YOU KNOW. MY LEADERSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN DRIVEN BY MY VALUES- THE VALUES OF OPPORTUNITY AND EQUITY AND JUSTICE AND INCLUSION IN THAT FRAMES HELLO LOOK AT EVERYTHING. HOW IT LOOKS HI LOOKING ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. FIGHTING FIGHTING FOR AND SEEING OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES MAKING SURE THEY'RE NOT BEING HEARD BYE BYE BIG POLLUTERS. THAT IS A GOOD POLICY TO ME IF YOU'RE HELPING PROTECT. BY THE DISADVANTAGED VULNERABLE THE VOICELESS FROM THE OVERREACH FOR THE ABUSE OF THOSE WITH POWER- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE. THAT CORPORATIONS AREN'T. CHEATING ARE CONSUMERS FOR OVERSTEPPING THE BOUNDS OF THEIR AUTHORITY TO HURT- PEOPLE ARE VIOLATE THEIR PRIVACY- IT'S THAT FRAMEWORK WHICH HELPS ME DETERMINE WHAT IT'S GOOD POLICY. AND SO POLICY IT IS PART OF THE OFFICE I'M HAVING PRIORITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE BASED ON VALUES AND BASED ON A PUBLIC POLICY. GOAL IN ORDER TO PROTECT LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES STOP WITH CALIFORNIA'S VALUES TO. RESTORE YOU TO PUT MORE JUSTICE INTO OUR PROGRAM BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THOSE ARE ALL POLICY DECISIONS THAT ARE VALUE BASED VALUE DRIVEN. AND OUR GUIDE- MY ROLE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD I HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF BEING CONFIRMED. THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND I REALLY APPRECIATED IT SORT OF TEES. OFF THE NEXT. TOPIC BECAUSE ONE A YEAR YOU WILL BE IN IN ENVIRONMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAND. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES ALONG THE COAST WHERE THERE WAS PROPOSED OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. STATE ADMINISTRATION LIKE TO FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION MARKET THE ONLY THING THAT WAS STANDING BETWEEN US AND WHAT WE DID WANT. FOR A FEW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LIKE LEON PANETTA AND JOHN VAN DE KAMP- IS THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S IN A UNIQUE POSITION BECAUSE THE HEAD OF THE STATE AT A DIFFERENT POLICY DIRECTION. AND YET HE WAS ELECTED BY THE STATE AND HAD A DISTINCT VIEW THAT HAD TO ACT ON HIS OWN IT IN DOING THAT HOW DO YOU SEE THAT ROLE- AND NOW OF COURSE. THERE'S A LITTLE MORE WHATEVER. THE EUPHEMISM WITH ME HEGEMONY AMONG THE STATE OFFICIALS WHERE THERE USED TO BE A MANY MORE SWEATS BUT HOW DO YOU SEE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TAKE ACTION ON THINGS. THAT THAT MIGHT. BE WHERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE LEAD. WHAT VEHICLE YOU YOU POINT OUT TO REALLY IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE TWENTY GENERAL'S ROLE WHICH IS ONE. TO REPRESENT CLIENTS DEPARTMENT CLIENT AGENCY CLIENTS- BUT ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES HAS. BROAD AND WIDE SCOPE OF AUTHORITY. AND TO ACT ON ITS OWN IN IN DEFENSE OF OUR- ENVIRONMENT TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. TO SEEK ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. SO YOU KNOW I LIKE TO COLLABORATE I LIKE TO DO THINGS THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA- BY WORKING WITH OTHERS TO IDENTIFY WHAT THAT IS TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE I HOPE TO AND NOT HAVE. FRICTION OR INCONSISTENCY AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT SOMETIMES IT'LL HAPPEN. AND IF IT'S SOMETHING WITHIN MY AUTHORITY- THAT IS A- AND AT THAT TIME THE POWER TO DO AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD BE CONFIRMED- I WILL FOLLOW MY VALUES. TO DO WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT FOR THE THAT ABOUT PEOPLE AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE STATE. AND THAT TIES TOGETHER INTERESTINGLY THE QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I MENTIONED. ONE WHEN WE TALKED. THE THERE WAS A- DEPUTY ATTORNEY GNERAL. THAT HUNDRED. FOR THE ISSUES AT LAKE TAHOE. AND HE WAS THE LEADER ON MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT THINGS WERE DONE AND IT MADE OF COURSE MANY ELECTED OFFICIALS PARTICULARLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE STATE LINE NOT THIS ONE COMPLETELY CRAZY. WITH IT AND YET HE MONITORED IT THERE HAD BEEN AN UPDATED GENERAL PLAN IN TWENTY YEARS THERE'D BEEN ALL THESE ISSUES AND ONE OF THE MAJOR LEADERS. IN SORT OF FOUR PLAYERS WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN SHORT TIMES INTO THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW YOU TAKE IN YOUR MANAGEMENT STYLE YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE SPREAD ALL OVER THE PLACE. DEALING WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND HERE'S ONE THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST INFORMED PERSON ON LEGAL ISSUES AT LAKE TAHOE. AND HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PREPARED TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE YOU SET THE OFFICE. SITUATION THAT YOU GET THAT INFORMATION AND HOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE READY TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY FEW HALF TO I MEAN. YOU FEEL LIKE ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TIED TOGETHER IN THAT. I MEAN YOU YOU POINT TO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF RUNNING OUT OF AN OFFICE WITH. AS MANY TALENTED. A PERSONALITY HOUSES AS A BROADER SCOPE OF SUBJECT MATTER THAT COVERS AND AS BIG AS IT IS AND- IT'S YOU KNOW I HOPE YOU KNOW THIS IS IDEALISTIC I KNOW BUT I HOPE. IF I CONFIRMED THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO MEET. AND SPEND TIME WITH THE MANY GREAT MEMBERS OF THE OFFICE INTRODUCED THEM TO WHO I AM WHAT I CARE ABOUT WHAT I MY VALUES OR MY VISION IS. AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO. EARN THEIR TRUST AND GETUS ON THE SAME PAGE I KNOW THAT'S DIFFICULT. TOM BUT THAT'S MY HOPE AND I ALSO KNOW. THAT IT'S IN THAT YOU CAN WHEN YOU'RE SEEKING AN OUTCOME AN OUTCOME THAT'S GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE AND OPTIMISE GOOD FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE STATE. AND IT'S DELICATE AND SENSITIVE SOMETIMES THE RIGHT PERSONALITIES WORKING WITH THE OTHER RIGHT PERSONALITIES CAN CREATE THE MAGIC TO GET THERE. AND SO HAVING THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AT THE RIGHT TIME I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT. BY RELYING ON ENTRUSTING. THE GREAT TOWN THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO BUT IT'S A IT'S A BALANCING ACT HAVE YOU STATES MULTI FACTORIAL. AND IT'S NOT EASY. A THE- CENTER BAY ASKED ABOUT. CONV WHICH I WANT TALK AND GRAVE FOR THAT AND MAYBE ONE LAST THING- I ASKED IN THE MEETING WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES WOULD BE. THE FIRST THING THAT YOU MENTIONED WAS HAVING TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW THAT IS COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU SEE THAT AND WHAT YOU. THINK YOU WOULD DO GIVEN THAT RESPONSIBILITY. ABSOLUTELY. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS GOING TO DO IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS IS STANDING UP. THE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING DIVISION THAT IS CALLED FOR BY AB FIFTEEN OH SIX. A BILL THAT MY- COLLEAGUES ARE PROBABLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY WAS LEAD AUTHOR ON I WAS TRYING TO PULL OFF THEIR WITH THEM. MYERS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. DO A INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF. ALL OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS THAT LEAD TO THE DEATH OF A CALIFORNIA. AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW. AS WE HAVE A RACIAL JUSTICE RECKONING IN THIS NATION HOW WE- HAVE A RECKONING AROUND HOW WE- POLICE IN THE STATE AND IN THIS NATION HOW WE THINK ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS SO NECESSARY THAT WE NEED TO REBUILD THAT TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES AND I BELIEVE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE INVALUABLE- PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY WANT TO BUILD INTERNET TRUST. ACCOUNTABILITY IS PART OF THAT TRUST AND STANDING UP AB FIFTEEN OH SIX A KEY PART- TO TRY TO THE AMERICA YOU ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. SUPPORTING AND TRAINING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HIGHWAYS WHERE THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY POLICING AND DE ESCALATION- AND HOW TO IDENTIFY AND INVESTIGATE HATE CRIMES AND IN REDUCING AND REMOVING IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS. THEIR- WITH A CONTACT AB FIFTEEN OH SIX WE EXPECT BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA THAT THERE WILL BE ABOUT. FORTY OF THE CASES THAT QUALIFY UNDER AB FIFTEEN OH SIX. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT. THE TWENTY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS NOT. IN THE PAST GENERALLY. INVESTIGATED LARGE NUMBERS OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND SO RAMPING UP TO BE ABLE TO DO FORTY A YEAR. IS AN IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR AND- THOSE WHO ARE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF LIFE OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO DIED DURING INTERACTIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. ANYONE WHO IS BEING INVESTIGATED THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA. ALL DESERVE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT THAT'D BE. THOROUGH AND ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE AND RELIABLE AND FULL OF INTEGRITY SO THAT WHEN AN INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. THE RESULTS ARE TRUSTED FOR THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT. FIRST BY ONE OF THE FIRST PRIORITIES SHOULD I HAVE THE HONOR BEING CONFIRMED. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WANT TO LEAVE. QUESTIONS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT A ME OUT BOB YOU MIGHT HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE I HAD WHEN I WAS IN THE CABINET WHERE I WOULD BE IN A MEETING AND SOMEBODY WOULD SAY WELL WHO AUTHORED THIS STUPID LAW. AND I WOULD HAVE TO TELL THEM WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT. SO I WISH YOU LUCK IN THE- THANK YOU'VE BEEN REALLY RISK. TO MARK. THANK YOU CENTER THERE TO. THANK SENATOR LET ME TURN TO US SENATOR COM LOCKER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WELL- I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY WITH YOU I. WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR WALKS AND NAV AND THE YOUR THE GARDEN OUTSIDE THE PARK AND KIND OF TALKING ABOUT ALL KINDS OF. WONDERFUL POSSIBLE SCENARIOS AND SO- TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY IS REALLY HEARTWARMING IT'S NICE TO SEE YOUR FAMILY HERE I KNOW YOUR WIFE MIA WAS HERE A LITTLE EARLIER. AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE FROM THE BAY AREA- THE FILIPINO AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN LA. IS POPPING BOTTLES LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT- THIS MOMENT SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU. AND LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LOVE COMING FROM FROM LA- AND FROM OUR FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORLD I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I KNOW WE HAD A REALLY FUN- DISCUSSION EARLIER THIS WEEK. AND I THINK I MENTIONED THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT. SOME OF THESE ISSUES THE FIRST ONE. IS- ABOUT HEALTHCARE. AND SPECIFICALLY THAT MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HOSPITALS. A WE KNOW THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU KNOW FILED AN ANTITRUST LAWSUIT THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE AG FILED IN OPPOSITION TO THE DELAY OF THE SETTLEMENT I THINK JUST RECENTLY. THERE WAS A PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT- AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A TRIAL SET FOR LATER THIS YEAR THIS IS SPECIFIC TO SUTTER HEALTH BUT- I KNOW THAT THE STATE IS REALLY ARGUED THAT- CONSOLIDATION IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS. FOR THE EXPENSIVE COST OF HEALTH- AND HOW DO WE REALLY MANAGE THAT AND I BELIEVE THE ARGUMENT IS THE LARGER THE SHARE OF THE MARKET THAT A HOSPITAL CONTROLS. THAT ALSO MEANS ARE ABLE TO DECIDE DECIDE COST TO DECIDE CARE EVEN TO DECIDE LABOR. THERE WAS A GREAT EXPOSE LATE LAST YEAR THAT ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF HAVING A BABY AND SAID THAT THE COST OF HAVING A BABY IN SACRAMENTO. WAS GREATER THAN THE COST OF HAVING A BABY IN NEW YORK. AND TAKING CARE OF A PREMATURE BABY IN NORTHERN CAL IS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND TAKING CARE FOR PREMATURE BABY IN SOUTHERN CAL IS ALMOST THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND- INCREDIBLY. EXPENSIVE AND- WE HAVE GOT TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS- AND ALSO THAT SOME OF THESE HOSPITALS ARE NOT PAYING. I THINK LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES OR EVENBUSINESS TAXES WE KNOW THAT THE FORMER AG WAS PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE IN THIS SPACE AND JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU- WHERE YOU STAND ON THIS ISSUE AND WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM YOU. AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE. THANK YOU SENATE ACCOMMODATE ME FOR SAY THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME AND- WHAT I ALREADY KNEW WHICH WAS THAT THE THAT THE JOY OF OUR WILL ARE ARE LOCKED TOGETHER IN A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD AND ALSO FOR THE KIND WORDS THAT YOU SHARED FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU FOR THAT- HEALTH CARE IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. IT HAS BEEN SINCE BEFORE I CAME TO THIS THIS LEGISLATURE HI HI I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT. EVERY PERSON. DESERVES TRUE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. AND THAT WE NEED TO BE ON- THE ON GOING ON GOING PURSUIT OF THAT OUTCOME AND TO BE IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE AND HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY- MY FATHER SET UP HEALTH CARE CLINICS FOR THE FARMWORKERS. IN CALIFORNIA AND IN FLORIDA HERE TO WORK FOR WHAT IS NOW THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SETTING UP CLINICS IN RURAL AREAS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MY FIRST JOB IN PUBLIC SERVICE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WAS THE ALAMEDA HEALTHCARE DISTRICT PROVIDING. HEALTH CARE TO. BY THE CITY OF ALAMEDA I HAVE SERVED ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. SINCE DAY ONE IN THIS- LEGISLATURE AND HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING AS CHAIR FOR TIME. AND ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY IS CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHAT THE AG'S ROLE IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE OVERSIGHT. ROLE ON THE TEN MERGERS. ENSURING STANDING UP FOR THE CONSUMER THATPERSON WHO IS PAYING THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND MAKING SURE THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE HIGHER COSTS WERE LESS ACCESS. AND THAT'S REALLY THE ONES LOOK TO YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT THE EVERYDAY PERSON OUR NEIGHBORS OUR FRIENDS OR LOVED ONES WHO NEED HEALTH CARE WHO DON'T WANT TO HAVE- A HEALTH CARE PROCEDURE TO MAKE THEM BANKRUPT YOU DON'T WANT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS AND THEIR RENT OR THEIR- FOOD ON THE TABLE. TO ALL BE SEEING AND THAT'S WILL BE FIGHTING FOR AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM ME SHOULD I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A PARTNER WITH YOU IN THAT FIGHT. SO I'M NOT LONG AGO I THINK A FEW YEARS AGO US SENATOR SKINNER ACTUALLY PASSED AND GOT SIGNED INTO LAW SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE- WHICH PERMITS THE INSPECTION OF CERTAIN PIECE. AND CUSTODY OFFICER RECORDS. WE KNOW THAT THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF CONSTERNATION BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT COMPLIED WITH THE LAW- HAVING SAID THAT SOME DESTROYED RECORDS. BEFOREIT WENT INTO EFFECT AND SOME INCLUDING THE DOJ REFUSED TO COMPLY AND EVENTUALLY THEY DID BUT TO A% SMALLER DEGREE THEN I THINK WHAT WAS EXPECTED. SO JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU HOW WILL YOU ENSURE THAT YOUR OFFICE. COMPLIES WITH RELEASING REQUESTED RECORDS. BUT I SUPPORTED THAT BILL. AS A LEGISLATOR AND I KNOW IT'S. LETTER AND I KNOW IT'S INTENT. AND IT IS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO. PROVIDE FOR INCREASED DISCLOSURE OUR AND MORE TRANSPARENCY AND BUT HOPEFULLY LEAD TO GREATER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THAT WILL BE MICHAEL TO DISCLOSE A CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW- I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS- MAYBE QUESTIONS AND I'M LEARNING AS I KIND OF GOT MY REDHOUNDS HEAD AROUND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS PUSHED LEGISLATIVE FUNDS WE PUT BILLS INTO THE WORLD. AND SOMETIMES THOSE WHO ARE- ASKED IMPLEMENT THEM THOSE QUESTIONS ARE THE DEPUTY ORDERS A SCENARIO WHERE ANTHONY CLARITY AND THERE WERE SOME AREAS HERE WHERE. THIRTY HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO PROSPECTIVE PURSES RETROSPECTIVE RECORD PRODUCTION. WITH RESPECT TO- RECORDS BY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE VERSUS THIRD PARTY RECORDS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE REALLY GETTING TO A CLEAR PATH NOW THAT WILL ALLOW FOR WHAT I WANT WHAT THE BILL IS INTENDED TO DO. WHICH IS TO DISCLOSE CONSISTENT WITHOUT LOCK. I LOVE THAT BECAUSE SO OFTEN YOU HEAR FOLKS SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR WAS AND YOU CAN SAY WELL. TELL YOU. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU- SO MY LAST QUESTION IS. I THINK DISTRICT OR REGION SPECIFIC IT'S ABOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I KNOW WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS. IN OUR MEETING TOGETHER- THE FORMER AG LAUNCHED A CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION OF OUR- L. A. COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. I DO KNOW THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING AND THERE'S PROBABLY LITTLE THAT YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION BUT- I'M CURIOUS. TO KNOW WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM YOU. YOU KNOW ON THIS BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION COMES AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE FORCE RETALIATION. AND OTHER MISCONDUCT- AS WELL AS SOME RECENT REPORTED INCIDENTS WERE OF ALL INVOLVING. LASD MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL. AND SO IF YOU CAN SHARE ANYTHING ON THE STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD BE GREAT- AND IF YOU CANNOT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT KIND OF. OVERSIGHT OPTIONS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO EXPLORE ONCE THIS INVESTIGATION CONCLUDES BECAUSE THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR SO MANY CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT. BUT ALSO FOR SO MANY FOLKS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THERE IS AS WE ALL KNOW A CURRENT INVESTIGATION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE INTO THE ALLEY- COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE- I HOPE IF I AM CONFIRMED TO GET FULLY BRIEFED ON IT STATUS IT AS YOU SAY IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO COMMENT ON ANY DETAILS OF THE OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION I'M FRANKLY NOT PRIVY TO THEM AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT AT THE MOMENT- BUT I'M AWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE AND I THINK- I'M- I'M- MY PLAN IS TO SEE IT THROUGH. NOW TO GET FULLY BRIEFED ON IT. AND TO USE THE TOOLS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TOOLBOX TO HELP- GET TO MEANINGFUL THOUGHTFUL- DURABLE REFORM. WHERE THERE ARE VIOLATIONS OF CIVIL RIGHTS TO CREATE BETTER M. PRACTICES AND PATTERNS USING THAT THE TOOLS GIVEN BY THE LEGISLATURE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO BRING PATTERN AND PRACTICE CASES- SOMETIMES THEY CAN BE COLLABORATIVE SOMETIMES THEIR THEIR SUIT. OFTEN THEY LEAD TO CONSENT JUDGMENTS ARE STIPULATED JUDGMENTS THAT CREATE A BETTER PATHWAY FORWARD TO END SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS WE SAW IN THE PAST AND HAVE A- A BETTER. MORE JUST BETTER PRACTICES THAT ARE MORE YOU KNOW THAT CONSISTS OF A CIVIL RIGHTS SO I SEE THAT AS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND I ATTENDED A FULLY BRIEFED ON THE SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION AND TAKE ACTION CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES I JUST SHOWED. THANK YOU WELL IF YOU FIND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT SIZED SCREWDRIVER OR WRENCH- OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BOLTS I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CALL US SO THAT WE CAN HELP YOU GET THOSE TOOLS. AND I AM VERY EXCITED FOR YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR WHILE WE WITH A- THE OPPORTUNITY WHILE WE HAVE SENATOR GROWTH HERE BECAUSE SHE IS DOING DOUBLE DUTY WITH- HEALTH COMMITTEE MADAM SECRETARY CAN I ASK YOU TO GO BACK AND OPEN THE ROLE ON THE BILL REFERRALS- SO WE CAN GET THAT VOTE RECORDED. GROWTH IDROVE FIVE. FIVE TO ZERO THANK YOU FIVE ZERO AND NOT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME DO THAT. LET ME ASK ARE YOU READY TO GO OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO FIRST. I CAN GO TO THAT EMAIL ABSOLUTELY I WANNA I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'VE I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED FOR. THE DOUBLE DUTY YOU'RE DOING TODAY SO SENATOR GO RIGHT AHEAD THINK HE'S MAD PRETEND YOU'RE ALWAYS SO GRACIOUS AND HELP ME WITH THIS DOUBLE DUTY COMMITTEE AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR I DON'T KNOW I THINK I KEPT YOU ON THE PHONE FOR OVER AN HOUR. THE OTHER DAY AN HOUR AND A HALF ANSWERING EVERY QUESTION THAT I HAD AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE AND- YOUR FORTHCOMING. NESS THAT YOU PROVIDED TO ME S. AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU BEING THE FIRST FILIPINO AMERICAN EVER APPOINTED TO THIS POSITION AND WHAT IT MEANT TO YOUR MOM AND I'M I APOLOGIZE I'M AND DOUBLE DUTY WITH HEALTH AND I'M ASSUMING THAT'S YOUR MOM. IN THE FRONT ROW. CONGRATULATIONS MA'AM. BY WE DID SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME HIGH ON SEVERAL ISSUES I'M ONE OF THEM OBVIOUSLY IS THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS THEM. NEAR AND DEAR NOT ONLY TO ME BUT TO MY- COMMUNITY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE TALK SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT- YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PREVENT LAW BREAKERS FROM OBTAINING FIREARMS ARE HAVING FIREARMS. WELL ALLOWING EVERY DAY NINE AM CITIZENS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR RIGHT BE PROTECTED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. AFTER UNTIL LIKE AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FEWER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHEN IT COMES TO THAT AND- COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND WE'RE NOT THE WORST BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT EVEN IN THE TOP FIFTY PERCENT- THAT WE'RE NOT IN THE TOP 50% AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH A LOT OF YOUR LEGISLATION THAT YOU'VE SUPPORTED IN THE PAST AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY VOTED ON THAT WAS VETOED BY THE CURRENT GOVERNOR IN OUR PREVIOUS GOVERNOR WITH BILLS THAT YOU SUPPORTED- AS- IT DID NOT REALLY LINE UP WITH WHAT WE HAD. CTUALLY TALKED ABOUT SOMEONE TO GO OVER A COUPLE OF THINGS WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND LAW ABIDING CITIZENS ACTUALLY HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE FIREARMS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR- JUST BECAUSE IT'S THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. MY VIEW IS THAT. BY ANOTHER SEGMENT I RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT. ANYONE WHO. I CONSIST OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS A LAW ABIDING GUN OWNER FOR SELF DEFENSE OR FOR HUNTING OR FOR SPORTING OR WHATEVER THE REASON. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH A QUARREL WITH I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MASS SHOOTINGS PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED- TO REGULARLY ASSEMBLY THAT CANNOT BECOME NORMAL- BUT SADLY HAD THREATENED TO BECOME NORMAL- I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH NEW TOWN. I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH KIDS BEING SHOT EN MASSE IN SCHOOL I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH CHILDREN HAVING TO DO ACTIVE GUN SHOOTER DRILLS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AS LEADERS C. THAT AS THE PROBLEM THAT IT IS. AND TAKE COMMONSENSE STEPS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND PROTECT CHILDREN IN FAMILIES AND CALIFORNIANS. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT AND I TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THOSE SHOOTINGS IN THE ISSUES THAT COME UP. WITH AS THE TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON THE BOOKS OR WHAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE. THAT WOULD PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. I THINK WE- HAVE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- A BI PARTISAN EFFORT TO. REMOVE GUNS FROM THOSE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE IT BASED ON THE LAW AND THAT IS- IMPLEMENTATIONOF ON PREPARE PERSON SYSTEM DATABASE AND WE KNOW THAT THE- THE NUMBER OF. ACTIVE CASES ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS I SHOULDN'T HAVE GUNS AND THAT WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO- REDUCE THAT I IDENTIFIED EARLIER FOR SENATOR BATES WHO WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS THIS POLICY AREA A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS AND WE NEED TO OVERCOME TO BEAT THE IMPLEMENTOR OF THE APP'S DATABASE- THAT THE DRIVEN GOVERNMENT WILL THAT WE WANT TO BE- AND THAT COULD BE SOME POLICY- IN WETHERBY BUDGET- OR OR OTHER TYPE OF POLICY TO HELP US GET THE RIGHT PERSON NOW THE SPECIAL AGENTS. WORK WOULD HAVE TO MANY VACANCIES RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND GET ON ON THE GROUND AND REMOVE THE GUNS FROM THOSE SHOULDN'T HAVE IT. IT COULD ALSO BE LEGISLATION OR YOU KNOW YOU'VE POTENTIALLY BUDGET LEGISLATION TO HELP ASSIST WITH THE NEED FOR A BETTER TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM THAT'S A LITTLE MORE FLUID IN A LITTLE MORE HELPFUL. IN HELPING IDENTIFY QUICKLY- THOSE WHO HAVE NEED HAVE COUNTRY MOVE SO THAT THAT'S ONE AREA AND LOOK AT THEM I'M REALLY INTERESTED AND EXCITED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF BIPARTISAN WORK SOME OF THE TWO OF THE BIGGEST THINGS I EVER DID IN THE LEGISLATURE WERE FOUND IN COLLABORATION WITH BIPARTISAN. GROUPS ONE WAY TO SUPPORTING REGULATIONS TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND CHILDREN AND THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND MEDICAL CANNABIS PROMISE OF AN OVERLAP HE WAS A KEY PART OF THAT GROUP ANOTHER WAS A CRITICAL CONSUMER PROTECTION. EFFORTS TO BAN THE USE OF SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS. WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER STALI AND MAIENSCHEIN AS PART OF THE GROUP AS WELL WE CAN DO BIG THINGS TOGETHER BIPARTISAN. IF WE SEEK AND FIND COMMON GROUND. THANK YOU AM I DO PRE THAT I APPRECIATE RESPOND. WAS LOOKING- LITTLE BIT MORE IF AND YOU WANT TO CONTACT ME AFTERWARDS THAT'S FINE TOO- I WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE YOU KNOW I SEE THE GUN LAWS TO GO THROUGH THIS BUILDING FIREARM LAWS TO GO THROUGH THIS BUILDING. AND I DON'T SEE A LOT THAT STOPS- YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE THREE SHOOTINGS THE BOOK THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING DOWN AT TIME VENTURA. THAT WASN'T A PROHIBITED PERSON THAT YOU KNOW SO- THAT WAS INTERPRETED A PERSON SO I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WE DO NEED TO GO AFTER THIS YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS THERE ARE PROHIBITED PERSONS ON THAT PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST THAT SHE AND I KNOW SENATOR BATES PROBABLY COVERED THAT EXTENSIVELY. THERE HAS TO BE SOLUTIONS- THAT DON'T AFFECT- IN THE SAME SENSE THAT THE GENTLEMAN WHO COMMITTED THE BORDERLINE MASSACRE WHICH SAW THE LARGEST ONES WE'VE HAD IN CALIFORNIA. WAS NOT A PROHIBITED PERSON. AND IS THE SAME WAY THAT THE ILLEGAL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT THAT WAS DRIVING ON A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY. THAT WAS IN A STOLEN VEHICLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE I MEAN EVERY THING YOU COULD THINK OF BREAKING THE LAW. AND HE CAME ACROSS A- SEEK. A POLICE OFFICER OFFICER SCENE. AND SHOT HIM WE ALL WENT REMEMBER THAT RE FUNERAL IT WAS HORRIFIC. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME TYPE OF BALANCE BECAUSE- BUY BACK PROGRAMS THINGS LIKE THAT. AND NOEL. NO PERSON LIKE THAT INDIVIDUAL DRIVING THAT VEHICLE. ILLEGALLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE ILLEGAL FIREARM BREAKING THE LAW. FROM EIGHT IZZY. IS GOING TO TURN IN A FIREARM. AND THEY PRAYED SCRATCH THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE FIREARMS YOU KNOW. THEY PROBABLY FOUND ANOTHER WAY BESIDES REGISTERING REMISSION IN ORDER TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION I DON'T THINK THEY WENT AND GOT IT. DOJ CLEARANCE TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION. SO ALL OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT YOU READ THAT THAT THE LAWS REQUIRE FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS LIKE ME HAVE CARRIED A FIREARM SINCE I LEFT THE MILITARY I'VE HAD ONE. YOU KNOW FOR THEM SINCE I LEFT THE MILITARY. AND MY FAMILY GREW UP FIRE DISCRIMINATE RANCH SO WITH. YOU KNOW WE ALL LEARNED HOW TO SHOOT WE WERE LITTLE KIDS. AND SO ALL OF THE LAWS THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE AND YOU BEING THE TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THE CITY CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE JUST GONNA HURT OR RESTRICT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. BUT THOSE THAT- YOU KNOW LIKE JUST FOR EXAMPLE AND I DON'T MEAN TO KEEP BELIEVING THE ISSUE WILL MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE- WE NOW HAVE TO CHECK WE PURCHASED A MUNITION FOR THE DOJ YET FELT THIS PIECE OF PAPER. YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WHEN YOU'RE THERE TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION AND IN THE SENATE BACK SAYING YES YOU'RE OKAY OR NO YOU'RE NOT OKAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO PURCHASE OUR AMMUNITION LAWFULLY BUT THE CRIMINALS THEY'RE NOT DALY TO RELOAD THEY'LL FIND SOME WAY TO GET THEIR AMMUNITION. SO I JUST I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SOME TYPE OF ANY COULD BE VAGUE IF YOU WANT TO BE VAGUE BUT I'M LOOKING FOR SOME TYPE OF COMMITMENT THAT. WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON ISSUES THAT STOP CRIMINALS. FROM OBTAINING FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION AND THINGS LIKE THAT WITH AN INTENT TO HURT PEOPLE AND LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THEY JUST WANT THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS- PROTECTED. DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH HOOP AFTER HOOP AFTER HOOP AFTER HOOP. TO BUY A BOX OF FIFTY ROUNDS. YOU KNOW NINE MILLIMETER. YOU KNOW IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THANK YOU FOR THAT SENATOR BY I APPRECIATE IT- AND JUST TO BE CLEAR I WAS NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE APPS. SYSTEM IS A PNACEA A CURE ALL FOR ALL THINGS CONFINEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HI I WAS JUST POINTING IT OUT AS A AN AREA BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT GENERALLY I THINK. AND A PLACE WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS AND WORK TOGETHER SINCE YOU ASKED FOR AN EXAMPLE- I DO REALIZE THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS THAT NEED TO BE USED TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER SCENARIOS THAT YOU MENTIONED WHERE APPS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE OR SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- I ALSO REALIZE THERE ARE- THAT YOU INDICATE FOLKS WHO- ENOUGH FOR THE LAWS. AND WILL WILL ACQUIRE GUNS AND AMMUNITION. OUTSIDE OF LAW. SO YOU KNOW TO ME THAT MEANS IT'S IMPORTANT- IT'S SET TO THINK THROUGH WHO AND HOW. AND WHERE. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERDICTION. TO HELP ADDRESS AND BREAK UP THOSE. SORT OF SUPPLY LINES. I COULD BE HELPFUL- AT THE MULTIPLE. WAYS TO DO THIS AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE ONE THING I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOUR- SENATOR BATES. AND YOU HAVE BOTH SAID WHEN I TALKED ABOUT WHY I CARE ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE YOU TOLD ME YOU AGREE. THAT THAT THOSE MASSACRES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT YOU WANT AND THEN TO. WHERE WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREES ON THE HALF- BUT I AM WILLING TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU I DO SEE YOUR POINTS. ABOUT OTHER PLACES OUTSIDE OF SOMEBODY APPROACHES THAT I MAY HAVE. BEEN A CHAMPION FOR THE PAST DECADE ALSO WERE YOU COULD ALSO MAKE PROGRESS. AND I THINK THAT'S THE BENEFIT OF COOPERATION AND DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION. TO FIND OTHER PATHWAYS WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS. AND SOME YOU KNOW MAYBE WANT TO GREET ME AND- LIKE. I GENERALLY THINK. M. IF IT'S A- REASONABLE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THANK THAT INVOLVES- YOU KNOW BACKGROUND CHECK OR SOME REGISTRATION- AND NOT COULD LEAVE. LEAD TO SAVING SOMEONE'S LIFE. CAN THE- INCONVENIENT. MAYBE VERY INCONVENIENT- IT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER. BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A LIFE SAVED MAYBE MULTIPLE LIVES SAVED. SO I DON'T I DON'T TAKE IT LIGHTLY. BUT I THINK ON BALANCE IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE A LIFE FOR. YOU KNOW WITH THE FOR A LITTLE MORE RIGHT REGULATION A LITTLE REGISTRATION. OF MORE MINUTES AT ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT. IT IT'S WORTH IT. I DISAGREE AND I WOULD PINE ARE NOT RESPECT THAT THAT THAT THAT DISAGREEMENT IN YOUR OPINION. I'M NOT I DON'T I DON'T NEED TO GET IT. FRANKLY I REALLY DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU I DON'T MIND GOING IN A RESTAURANT I DON'T MIND GOING TO A TRAINING CLASS TO MAKE SURE I'M STILL ADEQUATE QUALIFIED USED BY FIREARMS. I DON'T MIND AND- SPENDING THE TIME FOR PRACTICE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF SOMETHING EVER DID HAPPEN IT NEVER HAS AND YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE TIME THAT I'VE HAD A FIREARM. BUT IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN THAT YOU KNOW DE I WOULD BE DEAD THE BEST QUALIFIED BEST TRAINED BEST YOU KNOW OF IT NOT TO HARM ANYBODY OTHER THAN THE PERPETRATOR THAT WAS HURTING ME OR- MY FAMILY. OR SOMEONE ELSE THANK GOD I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THAT POSITION. SO I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. I THINK WHAT WE DO. WE DISAGREE IS THAT. WHILE I DON'T MIND DOING THAT AND I KNOW. SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS THAT HAVE FIREARMS. THEY DON'T IND DOING THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON. THAT IS BREAKING THE LAW CONTINUALLY. HAS IS THERE IS WE STOP THE WAY THAT THEY GET THEIR FIREARMS SO THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME PROCESS SO. YOU IN YOUR NEW JOB CAN SAY NOW. AND IF YOU KNOW THERE THAT TAKE THAT PERSON. I APPRECIATE THAT I DON'T I'M GONNA ASK A QUESTION BECAUSE I WAS GONE. AND I WAS IN HEALTH DID AND SENATOR BATES- DID YOU. ASK THE POTENTIAL THE NOMINEE ABOUT SENATORS DALIBOR JUST MCGUIRE INTO ILLEGAL POT GROWS YOU DID NOT OKAY SO I'M GONNA GO TO THAT SUBJECT MATTER IF THAT'S OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HADN'T ALREADY ANSWERED THOSE QUESTIONS AND BE. DUPLICATIVE SO A PARTICULAR INTEREST OF MYSELF SENATOR DOLLY A FLORIDA MCGUIRE AND SENATOR BORDERS ON THE ILLEGAL POT GROWS ON THE STATE LANDS. AND THE IMPACT OUR WATER THE YOU KNOW THAT MY FAMILY RANCH THERE'S ILLEGAL POT GROW THE SHERIFF CAME. THERE WAS AND CANS OF CHEMICALS. BERYL'S BIG BARRELS OF CHEMICALS TRASH EVERYTHING. EXTRA WATER STREET. AND AGAIN. AND THIS IS NOT IN YOUR PURVIEW PER SE BUT SO THE RANCHESTER REPORT EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT'S AWFUL WATERSHED EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT COMES OUT OF A PIPE. BUT YET THESE PEOPLE CAN DESTROY OUR WATER ON OUR LAND AND WE THERE'S NO THERE'S NOTHING THERE SO THERE'S IT'S NOT THE SAME EQUITY IN THE LAWS. AND AS WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL CLIMATE- DAMAGE FROM THESE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS. WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON A DRESSING THESE ILLEGAL GROWS ON STATE LANDS AND PRIVATE LANDS THAT ARE- AFFECTING OUR WATER. I BELIEVE AND HOPE THAT MY RECORDS BEEN CLEAR ON THIS THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS IN THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE THE LEGAL MARKET PLACE NOT IN THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT I REALIZE THAT I PAVE I'VE HEARD FROM SOME NUMBER LACKEY ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY ABOUT THE BILLY DEEP CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE BUT I THINK THIS IS AN AREA OF AGAIN OF BIPARTISAN CONCERN AND POTENTIAL BIPARTISAN SOLUTION- WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT. IT'S NOT OKAY FROM IT UNDERMINES THE- OPERATORS IN THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE FOR FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES PAYING THEIR TAXES STRUGGLING AS BUSINESSES TO SUCCEED AND THEY'RE GETTING UNDER CUT BY THOSE ILLICIT MARKETPLACES WHO ARE WHO ARE FLOUTING THE LAW. WHAT WE DO TO- TO ADDRESS THAT- THERE MIGHT BE SOME DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO A WAR ON DRUGS- I DON'T WANT TO BE- THAT GO TOO FAR WITH. IT WITH OVER CRIMINALIZATION BUT I DO WANT THE OPERATORS TO NOT BE OPERATING IN THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE AND TO BE OPERATING IN THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE. SO I THINK SOME DISCOUNT WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO GET THERE. BUT I RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM IT IS A PROBLEM FOR ME AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THANK YOU SIR. AT THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS RINGING PAGO PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT AND BEFORE. THE LAW WAS PASSED I BELIEVE IN GRAY DAVIS WAS IN OFFICE- CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE ACTUALLY. DONE BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IF YOU HAD A SERIOUS ENOUGH VIOLATION THAT. YOU KNOW WARRANTED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TAKE ACTION AND THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT PAGA HAS- PASSED AND IT'S BECOME LAW. IT'S CREATED A- DISADVANTAGE TO A LOT OF- I WOULD SAY HONEST. EVERYDAY EMPLOYERS IN EMPLOYERS AREN'T PERFECT I DO NOT ANY EMPLOYER WHO STEALS WAGES DOESN'T TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES RIGHT DOESN'T PAY THEIR WAGES CORRECTLY DOESN'T GIVE THE VACATION BENEFITS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. I AM I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THAT AT ALL. BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY PAGA HAS AFFECTED BUSINESSES. FOR INSTANCE- AND- BUSINESSES AS THEY SAY THEY PAY WEEKLY EVERY WEEK AND ON THEIR PAYCHECK STUB IT USED TO SAY. WE CAN'T IN SEVEN ONE WEEK ENDING SEVEN EIGHT SO THE EMPLOYEE KNEW WHAT WEEK THAT PAY PERIOD COVERED. WELL THE LAW UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TO SIX WHICH MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. AND SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE INCLUSIVE DATES. AND IT HAS TO HAVE. A DASH BETWEEN THE INTO COLUSA DATES. SO THAT PARTICULAR EMPLOYER WAS FINED OVER MILLION DOLLARS FOR NOT HAVING INCLUSIVE DATES SEVEN ONE TWO SEVEN EIGHT. YOU KNOWA MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRINTED THING IN A PAYCHECK STUB. AS THE AFTER YEARS OF FIGHTING FOR EMPLOYERS ON PART OF THE LEGISLATURE DID. PASS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON THEM. AT AT WAY STATEMENTS AS I GUESS I WAS WHAT I CALL IT AND NOW THE SOLUTION IS TO REPRINT ALL THOSE STATEMENTS FEDEX THEM OVERNIGHT TO EVERY EMPLOYEE HE WAS AFFECTED WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION ON HIM I JUST SAY ALL THAT BECAUSE PAGO LAWS ARE I AM VERY DETRIMENTAL TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY EMPLOYERS- BECAUSE THE VOLUME THAT ATTORNEYS GET- TUNER FIFTY DOLLARS PER VIOLATION PER PENALTY AND THERE COULD BE FOUR FIVE VIOLATIONS ON ONE PAYCHECK STUB. NOT HORRENDOUS NOT LIKE BY PAGE YOU WERE SOMEBODY GOT PAID FORTY HOURS THEY WORK FORTY HOURS AND YOU ONLY PAY THEM FOR TWENTY FIVE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DASH BETWEEN THE DATES I'M TALKING ABOUT APPEAL BOX VERSUS A PHYSICAL ADDRESS AND BASICALLY THAT PENALTY APPLIES TO- AND I REALIZE YOU CAN'T CHANGE LEGISLATION IN THIS POSITION. BUT THAT THAT PENALTY APPLIES TO. AND WE ALL WORK HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE COME TO WORK AT THIS BUILDING EVERY DAY IF SOMEBODY SAYS WHO DO YOU WORK FOR WE COULD SAY THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE SAME THING WITH CHICORY ACROSS THE STREET OR ANY OTHER BUSINESS RIGHT DOESN'T MATTER DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU GO TO WORK. IS THE PAYCHECKS THAT HAD A PO BOX ADDRESS ON INSTEAD OF A PHYSICAL ADDRESS. THE INTENT INTERPRETATION UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT. FROM THE PREVIOUS ATTORNEY GENERAL. IS IT THAT IS INACCURATE INFORMATION BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT HAVE THE ACCURATE ADDRESS IN WHICH THEY DO THEIR WORK. WELL THIS IS A LOT FOR ANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WE'LL KNOW WHERE WE WORK AND WE CAN SAY WE WERE CUT SACRAMENTO STATE CAPITOL WHATEVER STAND THAT- YOU COULD PHYSICALLY REPORT TO TWENTY TWO WHATEVER TEN FIFTEEN L. STREET BUT IT MIGHT SAY I THINK WE CAN GET A CHECK FOR RULE SO WE SKIP US BECAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY IN VIOLATION OF THE WHOLE THING ANYWAYS. AND I JUST WAS CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT. YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT AND HOW ADVERSELY AND AGAIN I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT BREAK THE LAW. AND DON'T PAY WAGES AND UNDERCUT WAGES TO EMPLOYEES. IN ADVOCATING FOR THE- OR A MASKING THE QUESTION ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYERS AROUND THE STATE WHERE POGBA HAS GOT A 9100% INCREASE BECAUSE A LAWS PASSED IN THIS BUILDING THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT. NOT ONLY EMPLOYER BUT NOW THE EMPLOYEES. WHO NO LONGER GET. COMPANY VEHICLES TO DRIVE HOME BECAUSE- SOMEBODY SAID DRIVING HOME WAS A WAGING OUR ISSUE. WHEN IT ISN'T. SO NOW THEY DRIVE THEIR OWN CAR. TO THE JOB SITE BECAUSE THE COMPANY TRACK CAN DRIVE BACK TO ANOTHER LOCATION. M. THAT PUTS MORE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THINGS LIKE THAT- I'M ADVOCATING FOR JUST THE AVERAGE EVERYDAY EMPLOYERS TRYING TO SURVIVE THESE LAWS WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND I HOPE IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR PREDECESSOR I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU IN A POLITICAL POSITION I'M JUST LIKE I HOPE IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR PREDECESSOR- BY. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WITH BIPARTISAN THAT ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I VALUE- THE WORK THEY DO THE JOB THEY CREATE THE TAXES THEY PAY FOR THE COMMON GOOD ACTORS I THINK THAT'S SHARED ACROSS THE AISLE AND I ALSO SEE VERY SUPPORT OF OUR WORKERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK IN AND FAIR AND SAFE AND DIGNIFIED AND RESPECTFUL WORKING CONDITIONS. AND NOTHING MAKES ME HOW THAN A VIBRANT- STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WHERE. THEY WERE THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER- WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT PAGA- AND BEFORE I TALK TO SENATOR BATES I WAS ABLE TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH TO BECAUSE OF YOUR INTEREST AND PASSION FOR SENATE DEBATES BUT I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT- YOU KNOW. ADJUSTED JUSTICE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE. ZORK THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY UNDER STATUTE AND THEY HAVE DOES- RELEGATED SOME OF THEIR AUTHORITY TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER- SO A PAGA SUIT IS BROUGHT THAT THERE IS GOVERNMENT INTERACTION THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. DETERMINES THAT DOESN'T NOTICE LETTER AND LABOR COMMISSIONER CAN TAKE ON- A ROLE FOR INVESTIGATION IF THEY WISH. IF THEY WISH NOT TO THEN THE PRIVATE. ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN DO IT AND IT IS A SETTLEMENT BEING SOUGHT THAT SETTLEMENT NEEDS TO BE APPROVED. BUT SO THERE THERE ARE I GUESS CHECKS AND BALANCES IN PAPA- THAT I'VE- YOU KNOW THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WORKING ON THE GROUND. SO LET ME JUST AND WITH THIS THE IT'S AN AREA THAT I WOULD. WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SPEAK WITH YOU MORE ABOUT. SPEAK WITH FOLKS IN THE PARTNER JUSTICE ABOUT. AND POTENTIALLY THERE IS A WAY TO BE AWARE WORK TOGETHER TECH TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE- YOU KNOW IT CAN WORK FOR ALL. STAKEHOLDER THANK YOU KNOW I PRETTY YOU AND- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR.

OF AN INTO. BUT ONE IN WHICH YOU AS I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS A- SENATOR BATES EARLIER WHO SAID YOU BEAR THE- OF THE COMMUNITY MORE SO. ARE BECAUSE OF THAT. WE HAD A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONVERSATION ABOUT A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND I THINK EACH OF US HAVE PULLED OUT OF. THINGS THAT WE FELT LIKE NEEDED TO BE ON THE PUBLIC RECORD FOR VARIOUS REASONS FOR OUR COLLEAGUES OR- I ONLY HAVE TWO. AND HOPEFULLY MY- I KNOW THAT MY STAFF GOT THIS OVER TO YOU TODAY I HAD. A ZOOM MEETING THIS MORNING WITH A WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND CONVERSATION AROUND- THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS BEEN ASKED BY THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION.
