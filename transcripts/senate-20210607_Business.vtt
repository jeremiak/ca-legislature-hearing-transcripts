THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME AND- BUT

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:53.324
MY QUESTION- TO THIS FAMILY

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:55.493
MEMBER IS WHY DO YOU THINK YOU

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.496

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:03.801
AND I THINK. I WOULD HOPE THAT

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.703
NOW WHERE YOU'RE AT A POINT OF

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.139

SAYING THIS- I BELIEVE THAT

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.123
THIS THERE WAS A

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.025
MISUNDERSTANDING AND A MISTAKE

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.327
AND THAT'S WHY THE VETO WAS-

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:29.894
BROUGHT ABOUT THE FIRST TIME

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:33.731

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.269

DISABILITY ACCESS WHICH MEANS

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.096
THAT MANY ARCHITECTS MAY HAVE

YOU KNOW NET ZERO CARBON REALLY

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:37.421
IS THE DESIGN ISSUE OF OUR TIME

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.290
AND IT APPLIES TO ALL TYPES OF

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.624
PROPERTIES WITHIN THE BUILT

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.526

PROPERTIES PUBLIC PROPERTIES

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.432
SUCH AS HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:52.236
AND- FACILITIES. THE TECHNOLOGY

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:53.637
REALLY IS CHANGING AT WARP

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:55.372
SPEED EVERY YEAR IS DIFFERENT

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:57.641
IN TERMS OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE.

00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:01.078
TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT.

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:02.680
THE SECOND IS TAUGHT AND SO IT

00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:04.815
IS A PART OF PRE LICENSING

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:06.984
EDUCATION. BUT YOU KNOW MANY

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:09.019
ARCHITECTS MIGHT BE YEARS OR

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:11.088
EVEN DECADES PAST. BY THE TIME

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:13.390
WHICH THEY- QUALIFIED FOR THEIR

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:15.025
LICENSE BY EDUCATION AN

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:17.127
EXAMPLE. OF THE WAY TO MAKE

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:19.163
SURE THAT EVERY LICENSED

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.365
ARCHITECT HAS SOME EXPOSURE TO

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:24.935
THIS CRITICAL. ISSUE IS

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.570
CONTINUING EDUCATION- THERE ARE

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:28.806
MANY PROVIDERS ALREADY AS MR

00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:31.008
OPPERMAN INDICATED NOT JUST A

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:32.643
I. EIGHT. THERE IS A NEW

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.112
BUILDING INSTITUTE- COURSES BY

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:37.514
HANLEY WOOD GREEN BUILDING

00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:39.616
EDUCATION SERVICES COMPANY AND

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:41.652
WE THINK THAT MANY MANY MORE

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:44.154
WILL BE COMING. AND THE

00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:45.356
REQUIREMENT ON DISABILITY

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:46.890
ACCESS I THINK IT'S A LESS

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:49.593
PRODUCE IN THE TEN YEARS THAT

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.261
THAT REQUIREMENT HAS EXISTED.

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:53.097
THERE BEEN OVER SIX HUNDRED AND

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:54.131
FIFTY DIFFERENT COURSES BY A

00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:57.835
TREMENDOUS VARIETY OF PROVIDERS.

00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:01.138
A. I. A. IS A DISTINCT MINORITY

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:03.540
SO THE THERE IS NO MONOPOLY

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:04.675
GOING ON HERE WE THINK THE

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:07.311
COURSES ARE AVAILABLE NOW WE

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:07.811
THINK A LOT MORE WILL BE

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.780
COMING. YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.682
MINDFUL OF THE COMMENTS OF DR

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.885
AND THEN SENATOR JONES- IN

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:18.222
TERMS OF. OUTPUT BUILDING CODES

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:20.424
ARE CHANGING REGULARLY IN THIS

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:23.994
AREA TO REFLECT- THE INCREDIBLE

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:24.962
NEED TO REDUCE CARBON

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:27.097
FOOTPRINT. SO ONE OF THE WAYS

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.499
TO MEASURE OUTPUT IS ON THE

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.601
ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS BY

00:44:30.667 --> 00:44:32.469
LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIALS WHO

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.338
SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT WE DO

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:35.672
THINK THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:37.374
THAT NEEDS TO GET GOING AS SOON

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.243
AS POSSIBLE THE BILL WILL ALLOW

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:40.978
THIS TO BE A REQUIREMENT FOR

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:43.080

DO THINK THIS IS A REALLY

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.232
IMPORTANT TOPIC IT WAS NOTED

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:30.867
THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS 40% OF

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.536
CARBON EMISSIONS ARE FROM

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:33.804
BUILDINGS AND CONSISTENT WITH

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.273
MY DAD SB SIXTY EIGHT WE TALKED

ABOUT HOW CONTRACTORS THEY'RE

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:38.642
NOT OF CONTRACTORS WHO

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:41.945
UNDERSTAND. ON THE- YOU KNOW

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:43.847
THE KIND OF SCIENCE AND

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:46.750
AVAILABILITY OF A NEW ELECTION

YOU KNOW ALL LECTURE

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.819
COMPLIANCES LIKE HEAT PUMPS AND

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:50.287
OTHER THINGS AND I THINK IT'S

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.222
REALLY CRITICAL THAT THE

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:54.558
ARCHITECTS UNDERSTAND TO WHAT

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.026
IS NOW POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:58.829

00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:00.731
DAY NOW AND NEW MATURE IN A NEW

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:02.432

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:05.168
I COMMEND THIS. EFFORT AND I DO

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:06.770
THINK- WILL BE CENSORED

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.572
CONCERNS OF COME OVER

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:13.677
LEGISLATING. THESE BOARDS I

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:14.311
THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.712
EIGHT THESE ARE. THANK YOU

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:18.448
SENATOR DR. I YOU THANK YOU FOR

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:19.716
MUCH AND SHARE FIRST OF ALL I

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:20.984
DO WANT COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:23.186
A FOR TRYING TO DRESS- THIS

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.054
ISSUE OF BEING SURE THAT

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:26.289
ARCHITECTS- HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:31.828
AND SKILLS. TO DO- YOU KNOW.

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:35.265
ZERO NET CARBON- DESIGN YEAH.

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:37.801
IN AND I THINK THAT- SERVE OUT

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:40.170
FOR THE- PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:42.105
DISCUSSED I GUESS MY AGE. SO I

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:43.440
THINK WE NEED TO SEPARATE THE

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:44.775
IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE FROM

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:47.010
THOSE MANDATORY C. CONTINUE

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:49.446
EDUCATION IS THE PROPRIO TO

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:50.247
DRESSING A KNOWLEDGE

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:52.516
DEFICIENCY. RIGHT AT LEAST END

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.751
UP PORTION OR PERHAPS A LARGE

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:55.719
PORTION OF MEMBERS OF OUR

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:59.990
PROFESSION. AND I GUESS MY YOU

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.224
KNOW- MIKE. IS THAT FIRST OF

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:02.426
ALL WE DO KNOW FROM AN

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:03.527
EDUCATIONAL STANDPOINT

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:05.996
MANDATORY C. E. KNOWS THERE'S

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:06.530
NOTHING TO STOP THEM FROM

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:08.565
TAKING COURSES- OTHER THAN

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:10.167
POTENTIALLY THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:11.368
THOSE COURSES SO I THINK THE

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:12.569
QUESTION ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:13.770
COURSES RAISING THE POLICY

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:15.138
COMMENT ACTUALLY IS IMPORTANT

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:16.740
BECAUSE- IF THE COURSES ARE

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.108
AVAILABLE MAYBE THAT'S THE MAIN

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.443
BARRIER THAN THE REQUIREMENT

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:20.710
PEOPLE TAKE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.646
CREDITS. IN THAT CERTAINLY

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.014
THERE'S THE MAN FOR THAT

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.849
KNOWLEDGE- PEOPLE WILL- THE

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:27.651
OTHER THING THAT I LOVE TO KEEP

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.419
IN MIND IS THAT- YOU KNOW THIS

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:31.254
ALSO IS NOT ONLY REQUIREMENT

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:32.022
FOR ONE TIME IT'S AN ONGOING

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:33.356
REQUIREMENT AND CERTAINLY WELL

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:34.658
THIS IS I AGREE IT'S A VERY

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:36.460
IMPORTANT TOPIC I THINK PEOPLE

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.462
SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT-

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:39.996
IT'S- THIRTY SIX A ONE SIZE

00:51:40.063 --> 00:51:40.964
FITS ALL BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:41.832
AN ARCHITECT- SHE IS VERY

00:51:41.898 --> 00:51:44.134
KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THOSE LOTS OF

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.569
ZERO CARBON DESIGN WHO NOW

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:46.203
STILL HAS TO TAKE FIVE CREDITS

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:50.040
IN THIS WORSE THERE MIGHT BE.

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.308
SOME OTHER AREA THAT THEY- MAY

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:53.577
HAVE MORE OF THE- A- SO- SO

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:54.845
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:56.880
ABOUT I THINK. MANDATORY C. E.

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:57.981
IT'S NOT THAT I THINK ZERO

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.516
CARBON THAT CARBON CREDIT-

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.184
DESIGN ISN'T VERY IMPORTANT IN

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:02.085
FACT WE SHOULD TRY TO DO IT I

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:04.221
AM. YEAH I DO APPRECIATE THAT

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:05.222
THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF

00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:06.890
ARCHITECTS IS THE SPONSOR OF

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.358
THE BILL SO. THAT'S THE

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:10.260
PROFESSION ITSELF. ARE SAYING

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:11.595
THAT WE HAVE A NEED HERE WE

00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.096
FEEL IMMEDIATE NEEDS SO I DO

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:17.100
APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK THAT-

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:18.368
I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN AGAIN

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:19.970
LOOK AT. CERTAIN OUTCOMES NOT

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:21.938
JUST PROCESS MEASURES WHICH IS

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:23.173
THE PEOPLE TAKE A CLASS I DO

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.207
THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:25.542
ISSUE OF THE VEIL BELIEVE

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:27.677
CLASSES. ARE ARE THESE COURSES

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:29.246
BECAUSE THAT MAY BE MORE OF THE

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:31.414
BERRIER DANNY REQUIREMENTS- AND

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:32.682
I CERTAINLY HEARD THE TESTIMONY

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:34.584
FROM THE SPONSORS ABOUT TRYING

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:35.685
TO DRESS THAT. SO I GUESS WITH

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:38.455
THAT- I DO APPRECIATE THE WHAT

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:39.956
