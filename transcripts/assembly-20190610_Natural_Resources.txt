AQUIFER UNDER THAT MOJAVE DESERT. AND SELL IT TO VARIOUS WATER DISTRICTS IN OTHER PARTS OF OF THE STATE FOR PURPOSES OF GUARANTEEING WATER TO ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOMES AND SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE SCIENCES IN CONFLICT AS TO WHAT AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF PUMPING ACTUALLY IS. AND IF COULD EASE -- AND ITS SCIENTISTS HAPPEN TO BE WRONG THE PUMPING COULD POTENTIALLY DESTROY THE MOJAVE DESERT AND CERTAINLY IMPAIR THE WATER SUPPLY TO THOSE -- NEW HOMES. KNOW WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND IT IT ONLY DOES THIS. IS THAT SEEKS TO HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON THIS PROJECT. IN THIS VERY VOTE OF VERY FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM. AND HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON TO ENSURE THAT E GET THE SCIENCE RIGHT [inaudible] NOW THE PROJECT HAS BEEN STALLED. FOR MANY YEARS FRANKLY BECAUSE THE MASS SIMPLY DOESN'T ADD UP. COULD IS WANTS TO PULL AS I INDICATED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER PER YEAR OUT OF THE AQUIFER. BUT ADMITS THAT THE AQUIFER ONLY RECHARGES AT THE RATE OF ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET AND ALMOST SIX BILLION GALLONS OF WATER. NOW -- SCIENTISTS WORKING FOR THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. INSTEAD SAY THE REFILL RAIDER RECHARGE RATE IS MORE LIKE SEOUL. IN SHORT IF THE US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SCIENTISTS ARE CORRECT THAT'S AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OR ABOUT FOURTEEN BILLION GALLONS. LESS THAN THE KIDDIES PLAN -- CLEARLY THERE IS IN MY VIEW AND THE VIEW OF SOME OTHERS IS A SERIOUS CONFLICT IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. SURROUNDING THIS PROJECT AND WE THINK THAT CONFLICT SHOULD BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE PUMPING STARTS. THAT'S IN ESSENCE AND IN SHORT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. SO AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT I REQUEST WILL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST OF YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU HAVE WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT I DO THIS NEAR THE SITE AND CAM DELFINO. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KIM DELFINO AND I'M THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND WE REPRESENT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. DEFENDERS OF THE LONG HISTORY OF WORKING IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT IN FACT WE WERE THE ORGANIZATION THAT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SUCCESSFULLY. WERE ABLE TO LIST THE DESERT TORTOISE AS ENDANGERED UNDER THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. THE KEYS VALLEY IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE IT'S LOCATED IN THE EASTERN MOJAVE DESERT SOUTH OF THE MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE AN HISTORIC ROUTE. SIXTY SIX AND EAST OF THE TWENTY NINE PALMS MARINE CORPS BASE. ACCORDING TO INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE THE AQUIFER THAT THE KIDDIES CORPORATION PROPOSES TO MINE. EXTENDS INTO THE MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE AND THE NEWLY CREATED MY HOBBY TRAILS NATIONAL MONUMENT. THIS AQUIFER SUSTAINS DESERT SPRINGS IN PLANTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ICONIC DESERT WILDLIFE SPECIES INCLUDING DESERT TORTOISE BIGHORN SHEEP MY HOBBY FRINGE TOED LIZARD AND GET BOXES -- AS SENATOR AUTHORITY DETAILED -- THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL DISAGREEMENT OVER HOW MUCH OF THIS A PROJECT WILL DRIVE THE AQUIFER INTO OVERDRAFT -- IT PROPOSES UPON FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER OVER FIFTY YEARS THAT HE SAID THAT. SIXTEEN BILLION GALLONS OR FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE GALLONS PER SECOND OF WATER BEING PUMPED OUT THE AQUIFER. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SCIENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE -- AND THAT THE RESULT OF UNSUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MINING WILL DROP THE WATER TABLE IN THIS AREA. AND DRAIN IMPORTANT SPRINGS AND IMPACT PLANTS AND THE DESERT OF RESOURCES. AND IN FACT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE THE IMPACTS ARE VERY SEVERE IN THIS DRY LANDSCAPE THIS AREA GETS APPROXIMATELY TWO ONLY. JUST OVER TWO AND A HALF INCHES OF RAINFALL EVERY YEAR AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MODELING THE CLIMATE MODELING -- FROM THE I PC. THIS AREA WILL ONLY BECOME DRIER AND HOTTER -- SO THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IN THIS ERA OF DRIVING CALIFORNIA'S AWKWARD THAT THE ERROR OF DRIVING OUR AQUIFER'S INTO OVERDRAFT IS OVER WE'VE PASSED LEGISLATION TO THAT EFFECT. AND THAT WE MUST START MANAGING OUR AQUIFER'S SUSTAINABLY AND SB THREE OH SEVEN IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THAT POLICY IT WOULD PROTECT OUR DESERT'S AND OUR PUBLIC LANDS BY CREATING A DEFINITIVE PROCESS FOR THE STATE. TO ASSESS PROPOSALS TO EXPORT DESERT GROUND WATER TO OTHERS THE STATE AND INSURE THAT THESE OFFERS ARE BEING MANAGED APPROPRIATELY -- SB THREE OH SEVEN A PARTICULAR IS NECESSARY BECAUSE WE HAD IT'S EXPECTED THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT TO REVIEW THE SCIENCE SURROUNDING THIS GROUNDWATER MINING PROJECT AS PART OF THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT REVIEW. FOR RIGHT OF WAY APPLICATIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PIECES FORMER LAWYER. THAT REQUIREMENT OF REVIEW WAS SHELVED. SB WITH YOUR SEVEN AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROJECT IS EVALUATED BY STATE AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT OUR RARE AQUIFER'S ARE NOT MINDED OVERDRAFT HARMING IMPORTANT NATURAL RESOURCES AND FOR THESE REASONS WE OR DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO TAKE ROLL CALL SO WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HERE FRIEDMAN HERE FLORA FLOOR HERE CHAU CHOW HERE EGGMAN. GARCIA. GARCIA HERE LOW MOAN. MATHIS MATHIS HERE MCCARTY. MCCARTY HERE MELINDA'S WROTE TO G. STONE. STONE HERE. THANK YOU WE'VE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR -- OUR PRACTICE HERE IS TO ALLOW WITNESSES THREE MINUTES -- TO TESTIFY. CHAIR FRIEDMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NEIL THE SITE FOR THE NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. SB THREE ZERO SEVEN A BILL TO PROTECT OUR CALIFORNIA DESERT A PLACE THAT CALIFORNIANS HOLD AND LOVE DEARLY -- I LIKE THE FIRST RECOGNIZED THE CHAIR FOR HER TIRELESS EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL PARKS AND MONUMENTS AND FOR GIVING THE MOJAVE DESERT. A VOICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK. WE SEE THE CALIFORNIA DESERT AS AN ASSET WORTHY OF CONTINUED INVESTMENT. WE HAVE WORKED WITH GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO PROTECT ICONIC PLACES THAT SOME OF YOU MAY BE A VISIT VISITED BEFORE LIKE JOSHUA TREE AND DEATH VALLEY AND THE HOBBY. AND THIS IS PAYING OFF LITERALLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE THESE PROTECTED THAT'S OUR PARKS GENERATED FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. CREATED OVER FORTY ONE HUNDRED SUSTAINABLE JOBS AND GENERATED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOME THIS ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW EVERY YEAR. BUT THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION SEEKS TO PILLAGE WHAT WE HAVE BUILT UP OVER GENERATIONS BITES RECENT ACTION ELIMINATING FEDERAL NEED FOR REVIEW AND PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS. APPLYING TO THE PROPOSED KIDDIES GROUNDWATER MINING PROJECT. THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS RECKLESSLY HUNG THESE BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES OUT TO DRY IN ORDER TO HELP THE KIDDIES CORPORATION THAT IT HAS CLOSE TIES WITH. THERE MUST BE BOUNDARIES TO THIS POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE. AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEGLIGENCE SB THREE OH SEVEN EFFECTIVELY RESTORES SCIENCE BASED DECISION MAKING. THAT WE HAVE USED THAT CALIFORNIA HAS USED FOR DECADES TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR PUBLIC LANDS PRIOR TO THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. SO IN THE FACE OF THESE UNPRECEDENTED FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL ROLLBACKS TARGETING CALIFORNIA DESERT. THE STATE IS THE REGULATOR OF LAST RESORT. AND AS LONG BEACH POET AND SONGWRITER WARREN G. STATED. IT'S TIME FOR THE REGULATORS TO MOUNT UP. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD THEIR SUPPORT. FOR THE LEGISLATION. JUST NAME ORGANIZATION PLEASE AND WHETHER YOU SUPPORT IT. RIGHT ABOUT SOME ZERO CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THE SILENCE AS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND SUPPORT.

TELL TRYING NUMBER HAVE NEXT GEN CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. BRENDA WIKI CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. NOW I'M GOING TO INVITE THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL FOR UP TO THREE REPRESENTATIVES TO COME UP AND GIVE THEIR TESTIMONY. AND THREE MINUTES APIECE GENTLEMAN. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS JOE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G AND I'M HERE&lt;/c&gt; REPRESENTING KIDDIES TODAY WITH ME IS MISTER SCOTT SLATER'S CO KIDDIES TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE ABOUT PROJECT ITSELF. WE'RE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED. WE FURNISHED AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR THAT WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION AND I HAVE COPIES OF THEM HERE FOR MEMBERS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO REVIEW THEM. WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS THREE THINGS REAL QUICKLY FIRST OF ALL? THE PRESIDENT THAT THIS BILL SETS FOR ALL OF YOU HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE LISTENING AND AND DELIBERATING THIS BILL. THINK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THIS BILL SETS. IT SAYS THAT ANY PROJECT AS YOU TALK ABOUT WATER HOUSING IS BEING TWO OF THE PARTY ISSUES OUR STATE FACES. CAN SIMPLY BE APPROVED UNDER THE SEQUEL PROCESS WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS NOT SIMPLE. AND AFTER THAT. ODJICK THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS SUPPORT THAT YOUR DISTRICTS SUPPORTS. CAN BE TAKEN TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY LET'S ADD ONE MORE LAYER OF REVIEW LET'S TRY TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP A PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN TO SEE QUOTE. AND THEN SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED NO LESS THAN SIX TIMES. THAT IN ITSELF IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN TERMS OF PRECEDENT. IS FIRST OF ALL IT REQUIRES THE LANDS COMMISSION TO MAKE IT AFFIRMATIVE FINDING. THAT THE PROJECT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO ADVERSE IMPACT WHATSOEVER. THERE ISN'T ONE PROJECT IN THE STATE. MUCH LESS IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT COULD BE APPROVED IT THE STANDARD WAS THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO ADVERSE IMPACT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN TAX THAT'S WHAT MITIGATION IS ABOUT THAT'S THE WAY SEEK WAS SET UP. THERE'S NO PROJECT IN THE STATE THE COULD MEET THE STANDARD CONTAINED IN THIS BILL. SECONDLY THE BILL HAS NO ABILITY FOR THE LANDS COMMISSION TO IN FACT SAY. NOR DOES IT REQUIRE THE LANDS COMMISSION TO SAY WHAT THE BASIS OF THEIR FINDING IS IF THEY IN FACT FIND THAT THERE ARE ADVERSE IMPACTS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT UNDER THE BILL NO PROCESS SET UP UNDER THIS BILL. THAT WILL REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY FOR THEM TO IN FACT SAY WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF THOSE FINDINGS. THAT IS IN FACT WHAT IT DETERMINATION IS WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE REQUESTED AS AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL THAT. THAT THE AGENCY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION SO THAT ITS FINDINGS CAN BE. HELD IN PUBLIC HEARINGS IN TRANSPARENCY THE SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN IN FACT KNOW THE BASIS OF THOSE FINDINGS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW WHICH BY THE WAY COULD EASE IS NOT OPPOSED TO AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE SCIENCE THAT IS BEHIND THIS PROJECT. AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO A REVIEW OF THAT SCIENCE. OUR CONCERNS ARE WITH THAT REVIEW A THERE IS NO PROCESS ESTABLISHED IN THIS BILL. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR PUBLIC HEARINGS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSPARENCY AND AGAIN AS I SAID BEFORE THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT. THAT THE LANDS COMMISSION SAY IN FACT WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF THEIR SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND FINDINGS THAT LED THEM TO MAKE THEIR FIND. THAT SEEMS TO ME. THE BASIS OF WHAT A PUBLIC REVIEW SHOULD BE AS WITH PUBLIC HEARINGS TRANSPARENCY. AND THE DECISION SHOULD IN FACT SAY THE BASIS FOR THOSE FINDINGS AND IF YOU CAN FINISH UP THAT ACTUALLY ALMOST FOUR MINUTES STANDARD SECONDLY AS I TALK ABOUT THE STANDARD. YOU COULDN'T COMPLY WITH THERE'S NO PROJECT THAT CAN MEET THAT STANDARD OF NO ADVERSE IMPACT FINALLY I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT. IN FACT POINTS OUT. THE THE STANDARDS THAT APPLY UNDER SIGMA ARE THE STANDARDS THAT IT SHOULD APPLY HERE. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT WE COULD RE APPLY IF FOR TURN DOWN INITIALLY BY THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION MY QUESTION IS AGAIN. THE BILL DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THAT OR SPEAK TO THAT. WE WE CAN'T RE APPLY TO FIX IT IF THE COMMISSION'S NOT REQUIRED TO TELL US WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. AND SO IT AT A MINIMUM YOU WOULD THINK IN BASIC FAIRNESS THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TELL US WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND THEN IF WE DO WE APPLY DOES IT START TO TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCK AGAIN. BECAUSE IF IT DOES AND THEN WE REPLY AND THEN THEY SAY WELL WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR REPLY NOW WE'RE INTO A CONSTANT TWENTY FOUR HOUR I'M SORRY TWENTY FOUR MONTH. REPLY PERIOD IT'S A HAMSTER WHEEL THAT WE WOULD NEVER GET OFF OF FOR THAT REASONS WERE OPEN. TO A REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE WE WANT TO ASSIST WITH THAT BUT THE WAY THE BILL SET UP RIGHT NOW IT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN STACKING THE DECK. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SCOTT WHICH SHOULD BE HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL. AS MANY OF YOU MEMBERS KNOW -- THE STATUS OF THE CALPERS THE PATRIOTS COUNCIL HAS. THOUSANDS OF JOBS. POTENTIALLY THIS PROJECT GOES FORWARD AS TO THE REST OF THE BUILDING TRADES. AND WHILE WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. IN I DON'T. QUESTION HIS INTENT IN THE BILL. THE RECORD IS CLEAR. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO KILL THE KIDDIES PROJECT SO LET'S BE HONEST WITH THAT. THE RECORD'S CLEAR THE LANCE COMMISSION. HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THAT'S THEIR INTENT THEIR STAFF HAS MADE THIS CLEAR [inaudible] SO. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS RE CHECKED. IN TO PUT IN PLACE PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT AN OVER DRAFTING THAT GOES ON THEN THERE'S A CLEAR PATH TO DO THAT. AMEND THE BILL SENATE TO REVIEW TO A STATE AGENCY THAT DOESN'T HASN'T ALREADY. SPOILED THE WELL HASN'T ALREADY LAID OUT THEIR INTENT. BUT DON'T VOTE FOR THE BILL WAS CURRENT FORM AND SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO KILL THE JOBS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. BUT YOU JUST WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE THAT THE THAT SCIENCE WAS CHECKED AND THAT WE DIDN'T OVER DRAFT BECAUSE YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT. WITHOUT SENDING IT TO AN AGENCY THAT'S ME IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S INTENT WHICH IS TO KILL THE BILL AFFECT THE SYSTEM IN THE BILL TO KILL THE BILL. LET'S JUST AMEND THE BILL TO KILL THE PROJECT. THAT WOULD BE THE HONEST AND FORTHRIGHT THING TO DO AND SO WE WOULD URGE A NO VOTE OR A YES VOTE AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. COULD YOU HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS NUMBER OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE [inaudible] YEAH. THAT IS NOT BE HAPPY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES OPPOSED TO THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT IS BEING SET. OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY WE WANT TO PROTECT BASINS. BUT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE EXISTING SEE WHAT OUR NEIGHBOR PROCESS WE WOULD ASK THAT WE WORK ON THAT -- AND IN GENERAL JUST NAME AN ORGANIZATION AND THANK YOU FOR OPPOSE THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR PRESIDENTE CARADJA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GRANDMOTHER COALITION THE GROUND WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND TIDEWATER DISTRICT ALL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND BRING THIS FORWARD -- OR ARE YOU INTENDING TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT STE TODAY AMENDMENT OR I RECEIVED AMENDMENTS ON FRIDAY. LAST FRIDAY OKAY AS YOU KNOW I'M SORT OF BUSY WITH THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IN THE STUFF THAT. WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND WE'RE HERE TODAY ON MONDAY I'VE CONSIDERED AMENDMENTS I'VE AMENDED THE BILL -- IF I MAY IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR. WAS IT KIDDIES ASK FOR PROCESS AS DID COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE WE PUT A PROCESS IN. TERMS OF APPLICATION. WE REST PUT A TIME LINE AND WE PUT A TIME LINE AND WE WERE ASKED TO ADD THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AS TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT I RECEIVED ON FRIDAY -- THE TIMELINE IS FAIRLY RESTRICTIVE SIX MONTHS PLUS A SIX MONTH EXTENSION. FRANKLY SINCE NONE OF US REALLY KNOW HOW LONG. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO RECONCILE THE SCIENCE WE HOPE IT'S QUICK. I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO AGREE TO THAT NOW OF THE BILL CURRENTLY HAS FIFTEEN MONTHS PLUS A NINE MONTH EXTENSION FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY FOUR IS COMPROMISE POSSIBLE BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR CERTAINLY. BUT MY QUESTION SINCE I HAVE THE PLAYERS SITTING HERE TO MY RIGHT. IS IF I TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS ARE ANY SET OF AMENDMENTS WELL THAT BECAUSE ALL OF THE OPPOSITION. TO MOVE TO A SUPPORT POSITION [inaudible] MANAGER. AND I DON'T MEAN COULD THESE I MEAN ALL OF THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN THE OPPOSITION LISTED ON YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO THEN MICHAEL MY RESPONSES I THINK THE BILL'S PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW IF I THOUGHT IT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED I WOULD HAVE IMPROVED IT. WE TAKE AMENDMENTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT AND COMPROMISE SO IF WE TOOK THESE AMENDMENTS OR ANY VERSION OF THEM WITH IT BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION. TO GO TO A FULL SUPPORT POSITION WITH A LETTER IN SUPPORT. ALL OF THE OPPOSITION IS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. MELCHER AYE AYE I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHICH AMENDMENTS YOUR BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BUT I'M I'M IF YOU WANT THEM TO ANSWER IT IT'S FINE WITH ME OKAY MESSER MANAGER AYE THE THE SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT I HAVE FOR THE ONES. THAT I RECEIVED ON FRIDAY AND BASICALLY I CAN OUTLINE THEM. THE REQUESTED A WORD CHANGE FROM FINDINGS OUR FINDINGS TO DETERMINATION. OF THE REDUCE THE TIME LINE FOR THIS STUDY FROM FIFTEEN MONTHS PLUS A NINE MONTH EXTENSION TO SIX MONTHS PLUS THE SUCH SIX MONTHS EXTENSION. AND THERE'S ONE SENTENCE ADDED THAT. REQUIRES THE THE AGENCY WELL IF I MAY JUST SAY -- YOU KNOW THE I DON'T KNOW IF THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE'RE HERE TODAY TO VOTE ON A BILL SO. YOU KNOW FOR US TO AMENDED WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE WITHOUT EVERYBODY OF HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF READING IT AND ANALYZING AND HAVING THE OPPONENTS. OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL BE ABLE TO WAY AND WE'VE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY FROM SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL WHO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO WIN SO CERTAINLY. I DON'T MIND THEM ANSWERING AS AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE REALLY IN A POSITION OF AMENDING THE BILL NO NO AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE NOT I THINK THE THE AUTHOR JUST ASKED IF. THE OPPOSITION WAS PREPARED. THERE WAS -- IF IF THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR IF THAT IF THAT IF THE SENATOR WAS TO AGREE TO THAT. AND WHEN YOU GO TO SUPPORT IS A SHOULD ASSEMBLY WILL NOT EGGMAN THROUGH THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE ROTH -- YES WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROPOSED WHICH IS HE OUTLINED WAS CHANGING THE WORD FINDING TO DETERMINATION. ADDING FOR A MORE CONDENSED REVIEW PERIOD AND THE ONE ADDITIONAL SENTENCE WE WOULD BE IN SUPPORT. WE WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AS YOU SAW MANY OF THE STATEWIDE AID -- GROUPS. BUT THAT WE WOULD BE IN SUPPORT AS A MEMBER EGGMAN -- I COULD TELL YOU THAT MY BILLING TRADE UNIONS AND I HAD CAN SAY WITH A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THE ENTIRE BUILDING TRADES. WOULD SUPPORT THE SENATORS BILL WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU -- SO THANK YOU CENTER FOR I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE IT I MEAN I I KNOW YOU TO BE A MAN WHO WORKS AND COMPROMISES AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE SOME COMMITMENT. MY ISSUES ALWAYS AROUND WATER SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTED DELTA THAT WE NEED TO REGIONAL SELF SUFFICIENCY. AND LESS RELIANCE ON THE DELTA THAT WE CAN HAVE. THE BETTER IT IS AND MY QUESTIONS WERE SOME OF THE SAME OF IF IF HE WAS NOT ENOUGH AND THEN SHOULD NOT JUST FOR THIS PROJECT BUT FOR EVERY PROJECT WE PROPOSE. SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF IT'S IN A BASIN THAT HASN'T BEEN -- SUBJECT TO SIGNAL YET -- AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THAT'S QUESTION DI I HAD BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE. HE MET MADAM CHAIRMAN HAVE. MAY I RESPOND MENTION YES PLEASE THE SOME OF THIS I WAS GONNA RESPOND IN THE CLOTHES BUT LET ME RESPOND TO THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL. ISSUE -- WELL THIS IS NOT EVERY. THIS IS NOT EVERY REGION OF THE STATE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOJAVE DESERT HERE AND IN FACT I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S PRESIDENTIAL NOT TO DO THAT WOULD BE PRESIDENTIAL NOT TO DO THIS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TOP TO THE TAHOE AREA OF COURSE IS YOU KNOW SEEK WAS NOT THE FINAL -- DECIDER THERE'S A TOP THE TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING. GROUP WHEN IT COMES TO THE COAST. OF THE FACT THAT A LEAD AGENCY APPROVES OF FINALLY -- ARE ON THE COAST FOR A FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT SOMETHING SITTING ON THE SAND IS NOT THE FINAL. DECISION AT THAT POINT IT GOES TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION SO AS A LEGISLATURE AS A STATE WE HAVE SET UP -- ENTITIES TO PROVIDE FURTHER REVIEW AND SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL AREAS -- WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE SUCH AN AGENCY IN THE MOJAVE KING AND AND MAYBE WE SHOULD BUT IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THE COAST IT'S VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THE TAHOE. AREA IT'S A FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM -- THAT -- NAY A STATE TREASURER NATIONAL MONUMENT TO DESERVES PROTECTION. HEY THE ONLY NUMBER MCCARTY. YEAH I I WANTED TO JUST. MAYBE TALK ABOUT THIS ONE WORD CHANGE AND IT SEEMS THAT FOR YOU ALL TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT THE BILL NOW FOR THE ONE WORD CHANGED. ME THAT WE SHOULD TAKE INTO A LITTLE BIT WHAT THAT MEANS OF SELF. FOR THOSE COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN YOU APPROVE. PROJECTS THERE'S FINDINGS AND DECLARATION SO I UNDERSTAND THAT SO IN YOUR VERSION THE BILL SENATOR ROTH YOU HAVE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. DOING THIS SECONDARY VALUATION HAVING THIS FINDING UNDER THEIR PROPOSAL THEY WANT TO CHANGE THAT TO A DETERMINATION. AND WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS FAR AS WHAT THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THAT WOULD BE IN GRANTED WE DON'T HAVE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION FOLKS HERE RIGHT NOW BUT WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE. TO WIN MONEY -- MIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR MY UNDERSTANDING IS COULD THESE BELIEVES THE CHAIN FROM FINDING TO DETERMINATION WILL GIVE COULD THESE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO FILE A LAWSUIT IF THE ULTIMATE. RESOLUTION IS NOT TO COULD DISS LIKING -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF ATTORNEYS THAT I HAVE CONSULTED. IT IS A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE SO OF COURSE. FINDING DETERMINATION MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME. MADAM CHAIR LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION THAT WE TABLE THIS FOR A WEEK SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE TIME TO ANALYZE THESE AMENDMENTS WE CAN ALL COME BACK BETTER EDUCATED. MEMBERS FIND A SECOND AND ALSO. OKAY JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT. MOTION TO TABLE FOR A WEEK SO. SO INCOME BACK. AFTER YOU FURTHER ANALYZE THESE NO AMENDMENTS SOME TOLD THE MOTION IS DEBATABLE -- WOULD ANYBODY LIKE. TO DEBATE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. I WOULD PREFER THAT WE CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION THIS BILL IS NOW BASICALLY TO YOUR BILL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE KIDDIES PROJECT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. SAID MULTIPLE HEARINGS AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE HEARING -- WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WHY DON'T WE TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE -- WELL FOR FOR PURPOSES OF DEBATE MADAM SHARE. AGAIN MEMBERS IT IT SEEMS IN AND AS IT GOES BACK AND FORTH AND BASED ON THE OPPOSITION. AND AND FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD AND THAT IF WE DO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS ARE THE SENATOR. WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS THE OPPOSITION GETS REMOVED. I THINK INSTEAD OF GOING BACK AND FORTH ARE PUSHING A BILL FORWARD. LET'S JUST TAKE THE TIME TO ACTUALLY BETTER ANALYZE AND SEE WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. SO WE CAN ALL COME BACK AND HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON OR NOT VOTING ON ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR SPONSORS I HAVE. YES SIR A CURVING QUESTION SO -- JUST TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MOTION THAT'S ON ON THE TABLE -- THERE'S ALSO A WORLD WHERE AMENDMENTS COULD HAPPEN IN THE NEXT PHASE BUT I'M SORRY WHAT IS THE NEXT DAY IS WHAT IT IS WHAT IS THIS BILL GO. TO THIS WILL SHOW THIS BILL WILL GO TO APPROPRIATIONS SO THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER CHANCE TO ON THE HILL THERE WAS A DESIRE. CORRECT THIS IS NOT THE TABLING IN A WEEK IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU. MR FLORA OKAY I JUST -- I MEAN I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF JUST HOLD OFF ON LITTLE BECAUSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL ESPECIALLY COMING FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT HAPPENED WE ARE THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND WE GET ANOTHER WHACK AT IT IN APPROPRIATIONS AND THINGS GET AMENDED THERE. BUT IT'S OUR COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THE BILLS THAT COME OUT OF HERE. ARE GOOD AND IN ORDER AND EVERY DROP OF WATER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE PROJECTS AND WE MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF THE PROJECT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF STATE ALL THAT WATER COMES FROM US. THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. SO FOR MY CONSTITUENTS FOR ME TO VOTE ON A BILL LIKE THIS WHERE WE'RE KILLING ESSENTIALLY PROJECT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT THOSE FOLKS WHO GET BE RELIABLE ON CAN BE RELIED ON AND THE JOBS THERE IF WE HAVE AMENDMENTS TO TAKE AWAY THE OPPOSITION AND MOVE THIS THING FORWARD IN A PROPER WAY. I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THAT THANK YOU. MR OFF MANAGER I'M I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE COMMITTEE AND I KNOW YOU DID HEARD CLEARLY WHAT. WAS SAID HERE AND WHAT WAS SAID IS THAT. IF I TOOK THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF ME WHICH I CANNOT DO BECAUSE THE TIME LINE IS NOT ONE THAT I AGREE WITH THIS. WE WOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THAT. THAT IT WOULD REMOVE COULD DISS OPPOSITION AND PERHAPS THE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTED BY MISTER LATCH BUT AS YOU'LL NOTE FROM YOUR ANALYSIS THERE MUST BE FORTY OTHER. ENTITIES ON THAT SHEET SO THAT THE AMENDMENTS. THERE'S BEEN NO INDICATION THAT THE AMENDMENTS IF TAKEN WOULD REMOVE. ALL OF THE OPPOSITION AND CONVERT IT TO SUPPORT. MOVING BACK TO THE SENATE FOR CONCURRENCE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WE HAVE A MOTION HERE BUT I STILL HAVE MY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. OKAY WHY DON'T WE DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE AGAIN -- AMENDMENTS CAN BE TAKEN AS THE BILL MOVES TOWARDS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHAT WE ARE TALKING -- ABOUT IN ONE CASE A CHANGE OF A WORD WHICH THE AUTHOR DOES NOT BELIEVE. CHANGES THE BILL AND ANOTHER CASE AND A MEMBER THAT'S BEEN SUGGEST REGARD TO TIMELINE WHICH THE AUTHOR IS NOT -- HEARING TO BE INTERESTED IN ACCEPTING SO I BELIEVE THAT IT'S PROPER FOR US TO CONTINUE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL NOW IT'S IT'S COME FROM ITS HOUSE OF ORIGIN -- AND I THINK THAT TO STOP THE BILL AT THIS POINT -- I THINK THAT WE YOU KNOW SHOULD DO OUR JOB AND DEVOTE DISCUSSING THE BILL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US AND NOT TRYING TO AMENDED KIND OF ON THE FLY IN COMMITTEE OR OR PUSHING FOR A WEEK WHEN THIS BILL HAS BEEN. UNDER DISCUSSION FOR YEAR AND A HALF. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A VOTE ON THE MOTION. TO TABLE THE BILL. MY RECOMMENDATION IS A NO. I'LL BE VOTING NO. ON THE MOTION TO TABLE THE BILL MEMBERS FRIEDMAN NO FRIEDMAN NOW FLORA. FLORA AYE CHAU. CHAU NO EGGMAN. EGGMAN NO GARCIA. GARCIA NO LIMON. LIMON NO MATHIS. MATHIS I MCCARTY. MCCARTY NO MELINDA'S. MURATSUCHI. RIGHT TO CHANNEL STONE. STONE NO. HATE THE MOTION FAILS NOT GO BACK TO MR MCCARTY FOR HIS FOLLOW UP QUESTION YEAH I THINK IT AT AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID I'M SURE WE DON'T HAVE THE AMENDMENTS. BEFORE US THEY HAVE BEEN HANDED OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND SO FORTH BUT WE ARE HERE TODAY DEBATING THIS ISSUE SO -- IN A IN THE PAST TODAY THESE THIS THIS PRINCIPLE COULD BE OUT THERE SO I THINK WE DID JUST. TAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE SO CENTER YOU YOU SAID TWO THINGS ONE IS THE TIMELINE IS PROBLEMATIC INTO. THE WORD DEFINITION YOU CALLED A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE SO ON THE WORD. CHANGED IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ITS ANY SIGNIFICANT NOT COMMITMENTS TO YOU -- TO THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN EARLIER AND HAS THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WEIGHED IN ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEIR EVALUATION HAVE THEIR KNOWLEDGE HAVE AN ASK. ANY OF THE AGENCIES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE BILL. OKAY AND THEN TO THE UP TO THE PROPONENTS THE PROJECTS IN THE POLICY THE BILL. WHAT WHY ARE YOU PROPOSING THIS THIS WORK CHANGE AND WHAT VALUE DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE IN THE? IN THE EVALUATION AND YOU CONCUR THAT THE REASON YOU REALLY WANT IT IS THAT IF THERE IS A NEGATIVE. FINDING IN YOUR EYES FROM THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION OF THE CHANCE. TO TO APPEAL THAT -- SO IF I CAN HE HIT EACH ONE OF THE THE THREE ITEMS AND ALL START WITH THE YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE SUBSTITUTION WERE DETERMINATION. FOR FINDING AND I'LL START WITHOUT -- ONE I THINK IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD -- ANY STUDENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW -- UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY. AXE NOT BY FINDING THE ACT BY DETERMINATION -- A DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED BY FINDINGS WHICH MUST BE SUPPORTED BY FACTS. AND THIS IS THE THE TYPICAL STANDARD THAT SUPPLIED IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR SOMETHING THAT FAVORS KIDDIES WERE ASKING FOR SOMETHING SYMMETRICAL -- I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR SOME PEOPLE TO BELIEVE BUT WEARE A BELIEVER IN SCIENCE WE ARE WE DO EMBRACE REVIEW. WE ALREADY SUBMITTED TO A FIFTY YEAR ONGOING REVIEW ANNUAL REVIEW BY SAM MEDINA COUNTY. SO WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF THE INTROSPECTION OR THE REVIEW WE JUST WANT THERE TO BE CLOSER TO A PROCESS AND WE DON'T WANT WHETHER EITHER SIDE IS AGGRIEVED. OUGHT TO BE. PREVENTED FROM KNOWING THE BASIS FOR THE DECISION WHICH MUST BE PROVIDED AND THEN THE DETERMINATION WOULD SUGGEST IT'S FINAL. AS OPPOSED TO BEING A DO LOOP WHICH NEVER ENDS WELL IT'S A IT'S A FINDING IT'S NOT A DETERMINATION SO NO. ONE CAN DO ANYTHING WITH IT. AND AND SO ANOTHER WORDS FOR THOSE THAT WERE LAWYERS IT'S NOT JUSTICIABLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT OVER YET IT'S JUST CONTINUING SO. VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE WORD DETERMINATION SUBSTITUTED FOR FINDING I WOULD ALSO SAY IT IS THE SAME TERM. THAT IS USED IN THE BALANCE OF THE CHAPTER THAT THIS BILL IS BEING ADDED INTO THIS BECOMES EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IF YOU REVIEW EIGHTEEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN THEY ALL USE THE WORD DETERMINATION. NO WORD OF THESE FINDINGS. SO THAT'S THE FIRST -- ONE THE SECOND ONE HAS TO PERTAIN TO THE TIMING. NOW THE WAY THE AUTHORS DRAFTED THE BILL. IT PUTS THE BURDEN OF PROOF. ON KIDDIES AND SANTA MARGARITA AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO'S PROPOSING TO TRANSFER. A SHORTENED TIME PERIOD DOES NOT FAVOR US. IT WORKS AGAINST US. TO WHICH WE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN BEFORE WE SUBMIT BECAUSE BY THE MERE PASSAGE OF TIME IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO REACH THE FINDING. THE PREJUDICE RESULTS TO US AND A REJECTION. CONVERSELY BY PUTTING A TWO YEAR. WINDOW TO REVIEW THE EFFORT HERE IS REALLY TO BE HONEST TO CREATE A WAY. TO S. -- MAKE THE EXISTING E. I. R. STALE. THE PROJECT ITSELF WAS ALREADY GONE THROUGH A A ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IT WENT THROUGH A COUNTY INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROCESS WHICH IS RARELY MENTIONED. BOTH PURSUED WE WENT THROUGH TRIAL AND ON APPEAL. SO HERE WE ARE WITH THOSE APPROVALS IN TWENTY TWELVE NOW WE'RE IN. TWENTY NINETEEN WE CAN EVEN APPLY TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN IT COULD BE TWO YEARS AND THE VERY SAME PEOPLE. WHO ARE OPPOSING THE PROJECT NOW WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO START OVER AGAIN? AND FOR ANYBODY WHO HAS A WATER PROJECT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE OR ANY OTHER KIND OF PROJECT THEY SHOULD BE TERRIFIED WITH THAT OUTCOME BECAUSE ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS RUN OUT THE CLOCK. AND THE THIRD ITEM IS TO MAKE EXPRESS WHICH SHOULD BE IMPLIED BUT WE'D LIKE IT TO BE EXPRESS. AND THAT IS THAT IN MAKING A DECISION JUST LIKE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD DOES. JUST LIKE YOUR SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT PROCESS. WE WOULD LIKE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SAY IF THERE COULD BE MITIGATION. HERE IT IS DO IT AND THEN THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE ACOSTA CONSEQUENCE EMBRACE ME WHETHER WE GO FOR WITH THE PROJECT OR NOT. BUT AT LEAST WE WOULD NOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A CURABLE DEFECT AND COULD INVESTIGATE THE COST SO. WE'RE NOT AGAINST TRANSPARENCY WE'RE NOT AGAINST ASSUMING THE BURDEN OF PROOF. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO IMPOSE A STANDARD WHICH IS A SYMMETRICAL ANDONLY WORKS FOR KIDDIES AS BENEFIT THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT. WHETHER ARTS OPPONENTS OR US. TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INTO THIS PROCESS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE CONVENTION THANK YOU MR CHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH SIDES FOR VISITING MY OFFICE SAID EARLIER. OUR FINAL AYE A WE DEALT WITH THE SOME OF THE BILL -- BEFORE ARE BUT IT WAS -- VERY HELPFUL AND EDUCATIONAL SECOND TIME AROUND BECAUSE I GOT TO LEARN. A FEW THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT SO I'M I'M GRATEFUL -- NOW THE OPPOSITION I THINK EARLIER RAISED THE DHEA ASSERTION THAT THIS IS KIND OF ON PRESIDENT IT -- I THINK OF ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS SAYS SAID THAT. THE PROJECT WILL WILL UNDERGO AN INDEPENDENT UNDERSCORING INDEPENDENT REVIEW. AND ARE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING ALSO THAT -- WHEN THE ORIGINAL YARO IS FOR SHE CONDUCTED? OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION WAS ESPECIALLY PROVIDED BY COULD DIS ARM AND SO -- SANTA MARGARITA ESSENTIALLY DID SOME CERTIFICATION BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THEM. AND WHEN THE KIDS WAS LITIGATED IN COURT ARE THE CORD WAS ALSO. BASICALLY DOWN BY THE INFORMATION SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO IT. WITHOUT GOING BEYOND WHAT'S -- WHAT'S OUT THERE. SO I THINK WHAT DE A PROPOSAL INTENDS TO DO IS TO I'LL GET A MORE INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE PROCESS. I'M. SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM I I THINK IN THE PAST I SUPPORTED ASSEMBLY BILL AS I MENTIONED. AND AS TO THE DEFINITION -- DE THE PROPOSED CHANGED FROM FINDINGS TO DETERMINATION I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ARE THE CODE SECTION CC PECOS ACTION DOES CONTAIN BOTH. OF THE TERM FINDING AS WELL AS DETERMINATION AND AND BOTH TERMINOLOGIES WOULD ENTITLE OF FOR AN APPEAL PROCESS TO BE MADE THAT IS THE RATE OF MEN DAMOS RIGHT REALLY MANDATE. SO AS FAR AS THE PRACTICAL EFFECT IS CONCERNED I I DON'T THINK IT MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN DETERMINATION ARE. AND FINING SO SO BOB YOU KNOW IT'S A SO I TEND TO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S THE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME AS FAR AS PRACTICALITIES CONCERN. SO I'M I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE BUILD UP BASED ON NOT A THINK. UP. AND THE OTHER OF MEN MEN THAT WAS SO BEING PROPOSED I I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT THERE'S A TIME FRAME WHICH HE THEN SEEM TO AGREE WITH. SO -- YOU KNOW. IT M. ICE BASICALLY ARE OPERATING ON THE CORRECT INFORMATION AND WHAT I WHAT I STATED EARLIER -- I ACTUALLY I JUST WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY -- THAT THE PROJECT OPPONENTS OFTEN SITE TO THE ABSENCE OF INDEPENDENCE AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND I WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO KNOW. THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR WITH THE FULL VALUE OF THE U. S. G. S. OPINION. IN TWO THOUSAND TWO APPROVED ANY I. S. AND FOUND THAT THE PROJECT COULD BE CONDUCTED. WITH THREE TIMES THE PUMPING RATE WITH NO ADVERSE IMPACT. SO THAT WAS A DECISION THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WE REDUCE THE SIZE BY THREE TIMES. AND THEN SANTA MARGARITA REVIEWED IT. AND THEN THE COUNTY. REVIEWED IT TO THE COUNTY WAS NOT BOUND BY. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT IT CAUSED ITS OWN SET OF HEARINGS. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TESTIFIED IN A BIG IMPOSED A STOPPER ON GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWALS THE EVENT THAT THERE WERE ADVERSE IMPACTS SO THOSE. THOSE THREE REVIEWS -- ALL OCCURRED IN NONETHELESS WE'RE NOT OPPOSED. TO A NEW LEVEL REVIEW AS LONG AS IT GETS DAYLIGHT. I IN HIS OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. YEAH I GONNA GIVE DHEA PROPONE AND THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO RESPOND ALSO IF US SO DESIRE. WELL. YOU KNOW A CERTAIN THE THE PROBLEM IS THE SCIENCE IS IN CONFLICT IN THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY IN THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE AND AND THE REST OF THOSE SCIENTISTS. THAT ORIGINALLY OPINED ON THIS PROJECT AND DETERMINED THAT THE PUMPING RATE WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE COUNTRY. TO COULD DISSPOSITION BY THE WE COULD USE AS A RATHER NOVEL -- THEORY OF PUMPING HAVING TO DO WITH EVAPORATION AND IT AND COULD EASE MAYBE RIGHT. BUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER COULD EASE IS RIGHT OR NOT AND IF COULD EASE IS WRONG. WE COULD DO A REPUTABLE HARM TO THE MOJAVE DESERT SO THAT'S WHY I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS IS YOU KNOW I'M NOT KNOWN. I DON'T COMMENDED THIS COMMITTEE VERY OFTEN I DON'T GENERALLY CARRY WATER BILLS I'M NOT KNOWN AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST BUT IT SEEMED. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT YOU COULD HAVE THESE RATHER SIGNIFICANT CONFLICTS IN SCIENCE. IN ITS SCIENCE. NOW MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM WAS SCIENCE BUT WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL BERMAN ONLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE IS. AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT TOGETHER THE BILL IT IS SIMPLY ACE SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND RECONCILIATION IT IS FINDINGS. OF FACT ON THAT POINT NOT DISCRETION DISK. THE DISK DISCRETIONARY DECISION MAKING -- IT IS A IT IS A FINDING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE -- HOWEVER QUICKLY WE CAN POSSIBLY DO IT THANK YOU [inaudible] BACK [inaudible] HEY. THE MISTER MATHIS. SENATOR IT'S IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- THIS PROJECT STILL ON HAS THE COMPLETE A PERMIT APPROVAL AND METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT. THE PERMIT PROCESS A C. D. F. W.. FOR STREAMBED ALTERATIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO D. W. R. SIGMA CRITERIA FOUR SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCIENCE ARE YOU SAYING THAT THOSE. PROCESSES ARE GONNA DIG INTO THE SCIENCE IN THE DETAILS. THEN IN THAT. I MEAN COULD BECAUSE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LOOK AT THE SCIENCE OF THEIR AND SO I MEAN NIGHT I THINK I WOULD PERSONALLY RATHER STICK WITH WHAT'S BEEN TESTED IN TRUE SPECIALLY WITH THE NEW SIGMAR REGULATIONS -- AND THEN CREATE A WHOLE SEPARATE PROCESS ON MAYNARD ARE YOU SEEING THE PROCESS IS THERE ARE ACCURATE. AND THAT. PART OF THE REASON WHY WE NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WELL LET ME JUST TRY TO CLARIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. DEALS WITH LAKE INSTREAM BUT ALTERATION AGREEMENTS SO THE DEPARTMENT THAT PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO LOOK AT THE PROJECT AS IT PERTAINS. TO STREAM BED AN IMPACT ON STREAM BUT NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATES AND THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DISTRICT IN THE USE OF THE THE CONVEYANCE DEVICE -- WILL BE TALKING ABOUT WHEELING AGREEMENTS AND LOOKING AT WHETHER THE WATER QUALITY THAT'S BEING PUMPED INTO THE CONVEYANCE. IS GOING TO CAUSE A DETERIORATION IN THE WATER QUALITY IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS NOT WHETHER THE PUMPING RATE OF THE MOJAVE DESERT AND THE AQUIFER UNDERNEATH IT. IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE SO THEY THEY'RE THERE ARE FURTHER REVIEWS INCLUDING A BY THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IF THIS PARTICULAR OF PROJECT IN THE PIPE CROSSES STATE LANCER NEEDS TO BE A A LEASE AGREEMENT NEGOCIO SO DID OF YOU ARE SICK MY PROCESS AND SYMBOL THAT CRITERIA IS NOT. GOOD ENOUGH THIS SIGNAL DOES NOT REALLY AFFECT CAN COULD DISS OWN I BELIEVE THE OWN THEIR OWN APPELLATE DECISION. THE THE PARTY NOTES THAT COULD THAT SIGNAL IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS PROJECT TO LOW PRIORITY BASIN THERE ESSENTIALLY. THREE LANDOWNERS THAT POTENTIALLY DRAW FROM THE AQUIFER KIDDIES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE AS YOU KNOW SIGNAL IS DESIGNED. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE YOU HAVE NUMEROUS LANDOWNERS DRAWING FROM THE SAME. AQUIFER A WITHOUT ADJUDICATION TO TRY TO RESOLVE DEVELOP A GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THOSE AREAS. ABSOLUTELY AND I WAS NEVER VERY FAMILIAR SICKENING WHEN THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A STANDALONE THERE'S SEVERAL PROJECTS THAT YOU KNOWSOME OF THE CONCERNS HE STATED EARLIER WERE THAT. YOU KNOW THEY CAN PUMP. MORE THAN WHAT IS KNOWN TO BE IN THE BASIN BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL PROJECTS IN EVEN INCLUDED PROJECTS. AND NEAR DISTRICT THAT PUMP MORE THAN WHAT IS TYPICALLY INNOVATION FROM THE RAINFALL SO I MEAN THOSE. THOSE NUMBERS IN THE SCIENCE ALL OVER THE STATE OUR OUR OFFICE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BASIS OF THIS DECISION. TO WANT TO HAVE A NEW GROUNDS. THROUGH -- THE LAND A THIRTY WHICH YOUR BILL WOULD DEAL BUT I MEAN IT'S WE WE'VE SEEN THIS. ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROCESSES GO FORWARD WE'VE SEEN A SIGNAL PROCESS GO FORWARD WE'VE SEEN. SEVERAL DIFFERENT PIECES DIFFERENT COURT DECISIONS EVERYTHING ELSE LITIGATION AND I MEAN. TO TO SAY THAT. ALL THE RIGOROUS PROCESSES IN THE SCIENCE THROUGH EVERYTHING ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. THAT WE NEED A NEW SCIENTIFIC REVIEW. FOR THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE I MEAN I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS SENATOR IN AND I KNOW YOU'RE. A MAN OF THE LAWN A MAN WANTS TO SEE FARE THINGS HAPPEN. SO I MEAN I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHY WE WOULD CREATE A NEW PROCESS. WHEN THIS PROJECT STILL AS OTHER PROCESSES TO GO FORWARD TO IT'S STILL GOING TO GET THROUGH D. W. R. AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH SEQUEL? WILL MAKE MAY I COMMENT ON THE MAY I ADDRESS THE SEQUEL ISSUE. ABSOLUTELY VENTURE. YOU SEEK WAS A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE STATUTES DESIGN AND NOTIFY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT THERE'S A PROJECT. TO IDENTIFY -- ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND TO ADDRESS. MITIGATION MEASURES TO ADDRESS THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS -- IT IS NOT A PROCESS THAT IS DESIGNED TO RECONCILE -- SCIENCE IN FACT THE COURT SPECIFICALLY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO WEIGH EVIDENCE AND RECONCILE SCIENCE IN THE SECRET PROCESS EITHER TO TRIP TRIAL COURT OR THE APPELLATE COURT IS THE SAME STANDARD OF REVIEW. OF THE COURT MERELY LOOKS AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT TO SUPPORT. THE LEAD AGENCIES CONCLUSION FOR EXAMPLE THAT A PROJECT MAY PROCEED WITH THESE MITIGATION MEASURES THE COURT MAY NOT CONSIDER ANY OTHER EVIDENCE THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THE I. R.. EVEN IF IT'S MORE COMPELLING. THERE'S NO WEIGHING OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN FACT THAT POINT WAS CITED IN MADE VERY CLEAR IN THE COULD DISS OWN PUBLISHED. APPELLATE DECISION SO WHEN WE SAY SEEK FURTHER BEEN FIVE SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND SEEK WAS FULLY RESOLVED IN AND RECONCILE THESE ISSUES NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER THAN THE TRUTH IN FACT SEEK WITH DOES NOT PERMIT THAT SORT OF RECONCILIATION. AND NORMALLY. PERHAPS NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF THE TIME WHERE YOU HAVE A A LEAD AGENCY THAT SUBJECTIVE THAT'S OF A LOCAL CITY OR A COUNTY THAT WHERE THE ELECTED TO RESPONSIBLE TO CONSTITUENTS IN THE REGION WERE THAT LEAD AGENCY DOES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. AND ATTEMPTS TO RECONCILE THE SCIENCE AND PICK THE BEST SCIENCE IN ORDER TO BASE THAT. ON WHICH TO BASE THE PROJECT YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BUT WHERE YOU HAVE A LEAD AGENCY THAT HAS NO GROUND WATER. SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT. WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN THE PROJECT GETTING WATER? AND USES THE SCIENCE THAT SUPPORTS THAT AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANY. EVIL MOTIVE HERE. BUT IT YOU HAVE YOU CAN HAVE ANY -- ARE THAT IS FLAWED WAS SCIENCE THAT IS NOT RECONCILED AND IF IT'S NOT RECONCILED IT COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE CASE HERE. OKAY IT MAY I YEAH AND I LIKE THEIR FROM THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE IT WAS IT COULD I JUST WANT TO BE A LAWYER IN ON THIS THAT THERE WERE FOUR SEQUEL LAWSUITS. THERE WERE TWO LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COUNTY. UNDER ITS MANAGEMENT PLAN WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT SEEK WERE. IT WASN'T JUST SEQUEL. THERE WAS A SEQUEL PROCESS IN WHICH FINDINGS WERE MADE AND THEN THE COUNTY INDEPENDENTLY IMPOSED ITS OWN. ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES WHICH HAD THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF RECONCILING THE SAW THE THE SCIENCE BY CREATING A STOPPER. THEY PUT A FLOOR ON THE CHANGE IN ELEVATION IN THE GROUNDWATER TABLE SO REGARDLESS OF THE PUMP AGE. REGARDLESS OF THE RECHARGE. THE WATER TABLE COULD NOT CHANGE BY MORE THAN EIGHTY FEET. NOW THAT WAS WHAT WAS OF CHALLENGED IN COURT AND THAT WAS ALSO SUSTAIN IN COURT THIS IS NOT JUST TO SEE CORPORATE. MR LIKE I I THINK IS SOME ABOUT THIS I I THINK IT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO GET BACK TO THE POINT. WE SENT MANY HOURS WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE SENATOR WHEN WE DON'T DISAGREED WITH HIS DESIRE TO HAVE A REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE. ALL WE WANT TO KNOW IS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE'RE GONNA KNOW THAT THAT REVIEW THE SCIENCE WAS TRANSPARENT THAT RECONCILIATION IS TRANSPARENT. AND THAT INFANTS HE'S ME WE WE HAVE A MEMBER ASKING QUESTIONS SO WE'LL LET HIM FINISH ASKING US QUESTIONS. WELL I'D I'D LIKE THE MICHELIN'S RESPONSE THAT GOOD ON AS FAR AS THE SCIENCE GOES I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR I THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING THROUGH TO THE SUPPLEMENT. I APOLOGIZE IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO HIS QUESTION ABOUT THE SEQUEL LAWSUIT THAT'S FINE. BUT NOT TO GET BACK ON TO YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL I THINK WE UNDERSTAND THAT OKAY. MR MATHIS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I'D I'D LOVE TO HEAR. ONE MISTER. LANG HAS TO TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR IF YOU. WHAT ELECTION ARE YOU ASKING HIM I? ON ON THE REVIEW PART OF THE SCIENCE AND MY QUESTIONS GOT INTO YOU KNOW. WE'RE THERE'S DIFFERENT AREAS. THAT THIS PROJECT STUFF TO GO THROUGH WHERE THEY'RE GONNA DETERMINE DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC PARTS. ON ON SIGNETICS SPECIALLY THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET INTO WHAT THAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK LIKE WILL BE OVER DRAFT. THERE'S ALREADY DECISION THAT SHOWS THAT WATER TABLE HAS TO BE WITHIN THE EIGHTY FEET. SO THAT'S ALREADY BUILT INTO THAT THAT ARE GOING TO THAT SIGMA DECISION. AND IF MISTER LANG HAS ANYTHING FOR PERTINENT AROUND THAT ARENA HAVE I WILL I KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT. AND SINCE YOU KNOW WE'VE. GOT DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS WE CLEARLY THERE ONE INITIAL SCIENTIFIC PROCESS HERE SO IF HE HAS ANYTHING. GERMANE TO THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS A AND THEY COULD BE GOOD FOR THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR BUT OBVIOUSLY MADAM CHAIR NO THAT'S FINE I WASN'T SURE WHAT QUESTION YOU WANT TO SPEAK. SURE THEY WERE GETTING OFF TRACK WE'RE LOOKING FOR NEW TESTIMONY THIS IS A TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE TO DELIBERATE. ASK QUESTIONS THAT MAY HELP OR NOT AND AND IF THAT'S A WAY OF LEADING INTO ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY THINK WERE. LONG PAST THAT -- AND THERE IS A MOTION AND A SECOND ON THE FLOOR OKAY IF YOU CAN BRIEFLY IF USE IF YOU'VE ANY NEW INFORMATION TO ADD ABOUT THE SITE THE THE THE RECONCILING OF THE SCIENCE ALL ALLOW THAT. I THINK THAT INTERSECTION EIGHTEEN TEN D. DOES REQUIRE A REVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A PROJECT. WHAT WERE SIMPLY IN THAT CASE THE REVIEW ACTUALLY HAPPENS AT A PUBLIC TRANSPARENT WAY AND THE? THE THE DETERMINATION MADE IS DONE IN A PUBLIC WAY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING HERE IN THIS REVIEW IS IF A REVIEW IS DONE THAT IT BE. PUBLIC AND THAT THE BASIS OF THAT FINDING BE MADE PUBLIC AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU MISS LIMóN. THANK YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO BE REPETITIVE SO THAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR TWO YEARS AT LEAST -- AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT LED YOU ALL TO PROPOSE THE AMENDMENT YOU HAD JUST BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE AMENDMENTS -- IN THE TO YOUR CONVERSATION SO WHAT CONDITIONS CHANGE THAT YOU ARE NOW -- BRINGING FORWARD AMENDMENTS. HE DOES ALARM THE A LITTLE BIT THAT -- IN THE TO YOUR CONVERSATION IT IS DIDN'T SEE THESE -- COME FORWARD AND NOW THEY'RE HERE. YOU KNOW DAYS BEFORE THE VOTE IF YOU COULD JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT. MANAGER OF JULY REPRESENTING KIDDIES. WE'VE HAD A VARIETY OF DISCUSSIONS WE HAD A VERY THOROUGH HEARING IN DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL MOMENTS BACK IN THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO -- WE DISCUSSED MANY AMENDMENTS AT THAT POINT WE HAVE SINCE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SENATOR. THIS IS SORT OF BEEN A A LITTLE BIT OF A MOVING TARGET AND A AND A WORK IN PROGRESS QUITE FRANKLY WITH THE SENATOR. AS WE HAVE GONE A LONG WE HAVE IT HAD TRIED TO NARROW THE AMENDMENTS. WE DON'T BELIEVE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE FOR EXAMPLE AND AND THE ABILITY TO DO THIS BUT WITH THE SENATORS. STRONG FEELINGS THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT AGENCY WE DECIDED OKAY LET'S NARROW OR AMENDMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE PROCESS SO THAT WHATEVER AGENCY DOES IS REVIEW THAT THERE ARE PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT IT'S TRANSPARENT. AND THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT. THE FINDINGS THE BASIS OF THOSE FINDINGS BE PUBLIC SO THAT WE CAN KNOW THEM SO THAT THE OPPONENTS CAN KNOW THEM. THAT'S WHY WE LIKE THE WORD DETERMINATION BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT IT IS A DETERMINATION BOUND BY. FINDINGS AND FACTS THAT ARE THE BASIS OF THAT DETERMINATION SO SO WE HAVE NARROWED I REQUEST YES IT'S IT'S FOR PUBLIC TO SAY A SUPPLEMENT ASSEMBLY WILL MOVE OUT. OF ME -- NOT OUT OF THE FACT THAT WE FEEL STRONGER THAT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE BUT IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SENATOR AND THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL WE HAVE NARROWED I REQUEST. AND IS IT NOT THE CASE THAT STATE LANDS REVIEW THE PUBLIC LANDS. WE ARE VERY WE HEARD WE HOPE YES WE WE HOPE THAT THE IDEA WOULD BE IS THAT THE THE BOXES UNLESS THE APPLICANT. PROVIDE CARRIES THE BURDEN OF PROOF. SO [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FLOOR. THANK YOU A SENATOR HAVE PROCEDURE TIME I KNOW THIS BILL HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IN MY MAJOR CONCERN WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS QUITE FRANKLY THE PRECEDENT THAT SETS. WATER IS IS VITAL TO MY DISTRICT AND IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE REVIEWS LIKE THIS CONSTANTLY WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME -- I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS TREMENDOUS SO I AM CURIOUS SO YOU KNOW. WHAT XPECTS REDUCES THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION HAVE ON GROUNDWATER ISSUES AND I THINK WE CAN HEARD THAT MAYBE NOT A LOT? THEN WHY DID WE DECIDE THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE EFFORTS WHEN WE HAVE A STATE WATER RESOURCE BOARD OR D. W. ARE THOSE OF THE PROFESSIONALS THAT RELATE TO THIS ISSUE. AS A WE START TALKING ABOUT SIGMA WHICH IS GONNA HAVE A DRASTIC EFFECT ON MY DISTRICT. IF EVERYTHING THAT WE GO THROUGH WITH THE D. W. R. AND THE WATER BOARD. MY CONSTITUENTS ARE NOW POTENTIALLY GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A THIRD. AGENCY LOOKING DOWN THEIR THROAT. ON EVERY WATER PLAN THAT THEY PROPOSE. IT'S A HUGE CONCERN OF OURS BECAUSE THIS BILL. SEEMS TO HAVE GONE THROUGH. ALL. THE RED TAPE. TIME AND TIME AGAIN HELD UP IN COURT MULTIPLE TIMES. WE SAID IN THIS COMMITTEE A LOT. TALKING ABOUT. REDUCING SEEK WHAT. MAKING SURE WE FAST TRACK PROJECTS. NOT THIS BILL NOT THIS PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH ALL. AND YET IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH. SO REALLY COMES DOWN TO ONE THING FOR ME IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL. SIMPLY DON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME. AND THEY'RE DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO PUT A DEATH KNELL IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. AND THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN OF MINE. BECAUSE IF THESE PROJECTS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE DO NOT MOVE FORWARD. AND WE CANNOT FIND A STATE WIDE WATER FIX. ALL THINGS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN THIS. WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF WATER WE CAN'T BUILD RESERVOIRS. WE CAN'T BUILD CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. RIGHT NOW WE ARE AT LOCKED WITH THIS ISSUE. AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE -- PROJECT THAT I'M SEEING THAT HAS GONE THROUGH IT ALL. THAT WE'RE GONNA KILL. AS THEY WERE GOING TO KILL BECAUSE THERE'S A SERIES OF EMAILS THAT ARE OUT THERE. BETWEEN THE STATE. LANDS COMMISSION WITH THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL. THEY SHOW A CLEAR BIAS WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE WHEN THIS BILL COMES. AND I'VE GOT THE EMAILS AND WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE WITH YOU. BUT THIS IS A HUGE CONCERN WHEN YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY. ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN KILLING A PRIVATE PROJECT THAT CAN ONLY BENEFIT THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND IF IT DOES NOT GO THROUGH. IT FALLS BACK ON MY CONSTITUENTS. FALLS BACK ON OUR AREA. AND ARE CONVEYANCE DOWN THERE. WE HAVE TO TAKE AN HONEST LOOK AT WATER AND WE MUST. HAVE AN ENTIRE STATEWIDE WATER FIX AND I APOLOGIZE -- THIS BILL IS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A WHILE. BUT IF WE DO NOT GET THIS BILL RIGHT AND THIS IS THE PRESIDENT THAT WE SET. YOU KNOW IS COMMON ABOUT WARREN G. REGULATORS MOUNT UP WE'RE LEGISLATORS. WE'RE NOT REGULATORS. OKAY OUR JOB IS TO LEGISLATE AND LET THOSE FOLKS DO THEIR JOB. NOW IT'S GONE THROUGH IT. AND NOW WE'RE COMING BACK ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE AND I THINK THAT PRESIDENT IS -- IS DEVASTATING FOR A LOT OF PROJECTS THAT ARE SO VERY IMPORTANT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL OF YOU RESPOND WELL FIRST LET ME. THE SIGMA PHRASES BEEN BANDIED ABOUT HERE LET ME JUST. CLEAR THE AIR THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SIGMA. THERE IS NO SIGNUP PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND IF SOMEONE'S ANALYSIS REFLECTS THAT THEN I GUESS WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT. THE BASIS FOR THE STATEMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE SIGNET SIMPLY DOES NOT APPLY AS COULD DIS ITSELF. ADMITTED IN ITS OWN A PELLET PROCEDURE AND PUBLISHED APPELLATE DECISION. NUMBER ONE TWO WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PROJECTS I SUPPOSE IF THEY'RE IN THE MOJAVE. YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED. IF SOME OF US WHO HAVE VIEWS ABOUT THE MOJAVE -- ARE CORRECT. AND IF THE BILL PASSES PROJECTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY PROJECTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THIS UNLESS THEY HAPPEN TO BE ON THE COAST IN WHICH CASE YOU HAVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO DEAL WITH. I'VE I'VE ATTEMPTED TO OUTLINE THE THE THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECRET PROCESS IN THIS CASE IN THE AND THE ISSUE SIMPLE YOUR THE COURT CAN'T RESOLVE THE SCIENCE AND IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO BY LAW UNDER THE STANDARD TO REVIEW. NOW WE COULD ASK WHY COULD THESE AND ALL OF THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS. WHY KIDDIES HAS NOT ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE THE SCIENCE ITSELF? IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN NO ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR AND TWO TO TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR OR THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE. FEET PER YEAR INTO THAT OR TO PROTECT TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THE CONSEQUENCES OF FAILING TO GET A RIGHT. ARE NOT GOING TO IMPACT THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SIGMA ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE SEEK WE EVEN FOR SOME OF US WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE SEQUEL. BUT ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE MOJAVE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. MR. FOR AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THIS PRESIDENT. IS IS THE PART THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE PRESIDENT THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE YEAH THERE MAY NOT BE A PARTICULAR PROJECT. BUT IF WE DON'T LIKE A PROJECT THAT GOES THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT -- REVIEWS. FOR THAT THE STATE HAS SET UP. AND THEN IT GETS THE GREEN LIGHT TO GO AND THEN WE TAKE ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE THAT'S MY CONCERN. IS THAT THIS THINKING DOES GET HELD UP IN BOTTLED UP TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO THE CLOCK RESETS AND WE'RE STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN. AND GUESS WHAT STILL HAPPENING. WE STILL DON'T HAVE WATER. WE'RE STILL NOT CONVEYING WATER WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO. AND SO WHAT THIS IS TO ME IS JUST A A BUNCH OF BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE DESIGNED TO SLOW PROJECTS DOWN THE PARTICULAR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS DO NOT LIKE. AND THIS IS TO ME JUST ANOTHER CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THAT AND I THINK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE NOW MISTER ROTH WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE US ANY. CLOSING COMMENTS THAT YOU FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE AT THIS POINT MADAM CHAIR I THINK I'LL SPARE YOU. AND SIMPLY -- REQUEST AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WITH THAT -- I WILL BE VOTING YES ON THIS BILL -- I AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT. WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE GIVEN THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC LANDS LET'S BE CLEAR NOT EVERY WATER PROJECT IMPACTS PUBLIC LANDS MOST OF THEM DON'T. MOST WATER PROJECTS DON'T IMPACT ON JUST PUBLIC AND STATE LANDS BUT VERY FRAGILE LANDS I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT -- AND WITHOUT I'LL BE VOTING YES THAT COME WITH A ROLL CALL PLEASE.
