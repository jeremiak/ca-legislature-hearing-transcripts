TO PERHAPS CAN SEE -- WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SOMETIMES TO TO SAVE PEOPLE? FROM FROM UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENTS BUT BARBARA DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT. BECAUSE SHE WAS ON A MISSION.

THEY MET WHEN SHE WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE SWITCHBOARD -- AND HE WAS THE MESSENGER BOY -- BACK IN -- BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THEY HAD SWITCHBOARDS.

WAS MATCH MAKING IN MARRIAGES. WAS FINDING WAYS TO CONNECT. DOCTORS WHO WERE IMMIGRANTS TO PEOPLE WHO NEEDED THE HELP THE FAST THE FAST TRACK THEM THROUGH THE LICENSING PROCESS BUT REALLY BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.

RICH LIVES IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES AND WE'VE ALL HAD OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR LIVES TO MEET PEOPLE THAT HAVE INSPIRED US. PEOPLE THAT HAVE IMPACTED US I HAVE KNOWN BARBARA FOR DECADES AND AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER SHE WAS INDEED THE YANG TO SUPERVISOR YAROSLAVSKY JIANG IN THE MOST. SIGNIFICANT WAY. AND I JUST WITHOUT BEING REDUNDANT BUT A COUPLE OF ISSUES YOU KNOW NUMBER ONE IS SERVICE. AT EVERY LEVEL OF WHAT THAT WORD MEANT IN HER LIFE OFTEN SOMEONE IS A PARTNER TO A PUBLIC PERSON. A YOU KNOW WITH THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF CHALLENGES BUT SHE IN HER OWN RIGHT BE ON THE BOARD SHE SAT ON EVERYTHING THAT SHE DID. IN THE COMMUNITY WHEN SHE BEFORE SHE PASSED HAD A SERIOUS ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS STRIPPED ON A STEP IF YOU WANT TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD PASSED AWAY AND SHE WAS TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY THE STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO SHE BRING GIFTS TO AND SHE WOULD CALL THE GIFTS NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE THE BIRTHDAYS OF THE HOLIDAYS. SHE CALLED IN JUST BECAUSE GIFTS BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT ABOUT SOMEONE AND TOOK CARE OF HIM IN SO MANY WAYS ALL ACROSS THE COMMUNITIES NOT JUST IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY ALTHOUGH JUDAISM WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HER. AND I THINK THAT -- SO IT REALLY IS ABOUT SERVICE OR CHARACTER IT I I WAS WITH HER SO MANY TIMES IN SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND OFTEN WE SEE A PUBLIC FACE OF PEOPLE AND WE SEE A DIFFERENT FACE. IN PRIVATE THAT WEOFTEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE AND THAT WASN'T THE CASE WITH BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY AND LASTLY THE UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP THAT THEY HAD. A IN THE YING AND YANG THEY REALLY WERE TRUE PARTNERS ADDRESS LOSSKY WAS A DYNAMIC FORCE FOR DECADES IN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN SO MANY AREAS. OF PUBLIC POLICY BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY WAS AN EQUAL PARTNER IN EVERY ASPECT OF THAT WORD AND I JOIN IN. THE MEMORY IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT OF THAT.
