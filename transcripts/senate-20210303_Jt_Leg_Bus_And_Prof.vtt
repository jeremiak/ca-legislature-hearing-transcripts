00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:53.164
DREAM SPENT A LOT OF RESOURCES

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.966
DESIGNED INCREASE. I'M AND I

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.168
THINK WHEN COMING HERE AND

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:58.969
THEN. ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY IS

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.771
USING THREE ZERO USING PER USE

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:03.374
DIFFERENTLY AND SO WHAT I FOUND

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:06.944
IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF.

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.480
DESIGN ISSUES OR COMPLICATIONS

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.115

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.017
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LICENSING

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:15.219

HE WASN'T HARD TO DISCUSS

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:21.051
THERE'S PLENTY OF REASONS WHY-

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:22.186
OUR BUDGET WAS CHALLENGED IN

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:25.456
THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE TO.

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:29.026

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:41.605
SOME RACES FROM THAT J.

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:44.508

SEVENTY ONE PERCENT- THOSE WERE

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:57.020
BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND LEAD TO

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.056
THE REASONS WHY WE HAD TO RAISE

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:03.293
THE FEES. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.828
THAT- WE DIDN'T MAKE THE

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:06.630

DO TO MAKE OUR FIND. NOT A LOT

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:18.809
OF FUN TO BECOME INSTALLED

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.544
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.312
MANDATE TO KEEP OUR FIND OF A

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:24.581
CERTAIN LEVEL NOT FALL BELOW

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:29.486
THAT LEVEL- THE WAY I'M- I

ARE THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.078
ACTUALLY HOPE TO REDUCE THOSE

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:36.713
MINIMUM STANDARDS ARE RELAXED

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.049
THEM FOR SHELTERS SEEING THAT

SOME SHELTERS ARE HAVING HAVE

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:43.887
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS. WITH

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:46.423

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:13.650
REGULATIONS ARE AND THEY HAVE A

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:15.719
LOT OF SHELTER INPUT DURING

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.921
THAT TIME OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.890
MORE OPINIONS OUT THERE AND WE

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:21.858
WANT TO INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE-

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:23.694
BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.196
THE MINIMUM STANDARDS BOB FOR

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:27.898
ALL ANIMALS IN SHELTERS OR

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:33.537

OR THE WAY THE REGULATIONS ARE

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.244
WRITTEN NOW ALLOWS FOR

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.580
VETERINARIANS. TO WRITE UP

BETTER NERI SYSTEM. CAN AND

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:54.057
MINISTER VACCINES- THEY CAN

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:56.693
ADMINISTER PARASITE PREVENTION-

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.663

WITHOUT OF THAT BEING ON SITE

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.604
IF THOSE STAFF ARE WORKING

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.239
UNDER THE ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:13.176
WRITTEN- SO WE WOULD LIKE WE

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:14.578
WELCOME MORE EMPLOYED IT'S

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:15.779
EARLY IN THE PROCESS WE

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.180
UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.683
SHELTERS OUT THERE- THAT ARE

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.251
STILL HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:25.222
EVEN BEES. BUT WE HOPE THAT-

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:27.023
DURING THEIR- ABOUT PUBLIC

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.392
OPINION WE WILL CONTINUE TO

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:30.260
REFINE THESE BUT WE FELT THAT

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:32.295
THIS WAS A WAY TO RELAX THEM

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:33.964
FOR ITS FOR SHELTERS THEY CAN'T

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:36.500
FLY RIGHT NOW. IS LAW IS RIGHT

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:39.803
NOW THAT THEY- IS KIND OF

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:44.541
UNIFORM- AND- IF- WE NEED TO

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.076
CONSIDER OTHER THINGS WILL DO

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:47.978
THAT BUT THAT'S THE- BACK OF

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:49.746
THE CHAPTERS I WILL SAY THAT

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:55.185
DURING THAT WHOLE- M. D. C.

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:57.354
CHARING CROSS- SHELTERS WERE.

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:59.122
FAIRLY WELL REPRESENTED ARE R.

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:01.224
RV T. ON OUR OWN ON OUR BOARD

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:03.827
WAS A SHELTER RBG AT THE TIME.

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:05.262
AND THERE WAS A SHELTER

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:08.565
VETERINARIAN- ON THE RBT ON

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:10.801
THEM IN DC AT THE TIME. SO WE

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:13.870
TRIED TO INCLUDE- TESTIMONY AND

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:17.707
INPUT FROM ALL. ALL SOURCES. SO

00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:19.476
THAT'S AND MARK YOU MAY HAVE

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:20.744
SOMETHING TO ADD OR JESSICA BUT

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.145
THAT'S SORT OF THE BACKGROUND

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:24.681
ON THESE REGULATIONS AND AGAIN

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.983
THERE EARLY IN THE PROCESS. I

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:32.689
WOULD I WORK AT THE. A QUARTER

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.124
CAN REGULATES THE PRACTICES

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:37.260
THAT AMERICA'S. I ON THE ISSUE

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:40.931
OF MINIMUM STANDARDS UP THE

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:41.465
REASON WHY WE HAVE MINIMUM

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:44.734
STANDARDS IS. I ASSUME THAT ALL

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:47.037
OF YOU HAVE PETS AND- WHEN YOU

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.238
TAKE YOUR PET TO THE VETERINARY

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:50.373
HOSPITAL IT'S BECAUSE OF

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.509
MINIMUM STANDARDS THAT- THEIR

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:54.911
MEDICAL RECORDS FOR THAT THE

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:56.646
TALK ABOUT PREVIOUS VISITS

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.515
PREVIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS

00:51:58.582 --> 00:51:59.616
WHEN YOU'RE TAKEN INTO THE

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:01.151
EXAMINATION ROOM WONDER IF

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:02.886
THAT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN. THE

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:04.988
EXAMINATION ROOM IS CLEAN- THE

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.923
NEED ALSO TELL YEARS FOR GIVING

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:11.294
INJECTIONS OURS STERILE. ALEX

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:14.831
THE YEARS OR THE ASSEMBLY.

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:17.367
STANDARD IF MINIMUM STANDARDS

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:21.037
WE'RE IN PLACE THEN IT WOULD BE

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:23.540
DETRIMENTAL TO THE CONSUMER.

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.475
PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS ONLY ONE

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:27.544
SET OF MINIMUM STANDARDS BUT

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:29.880
DEFINITELY TIMES HAVE CHANGED

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:31.715
PRACTICE ACT CHANGES EVERY YEAR

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:33.583
AND WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.452
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRACTICES

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.120
THE PROBABLY WOULD REQUIRE

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:39.055
DIFFERENT TYPES OF STANDARDS.

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:40.891
IN PARTICULAR SHELTER MEDICINE

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:42.292
WE DEFINITELY REALIZED THE

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:45.829
CHALLENGES THEY FACE WHEREAS-

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:47.497
REVENUE THE ABILITY JOB FULLY

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:52.135
STAFFED- THEIR PRACTICES- BEING

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:54.671
IN RURAL AREAS NOT HAVING. A

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:58.241
VETERINARIAN BROWN'S JERSEYS

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:01.511
AND SO. WE LOW INTEREST- TO

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:04.681
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:05.482
PRACTICE VETERINARY MEDICINE.

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:09.619
BLACK WHEN DEALING WITH

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:11.922
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES IS ALWAYS

00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:13.857
GOING TO BE A POINT WHERE BOTH

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:18.161
SIDES JUST. HAVE DISAGREEMENTS-

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:20.030
WE CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.264
THERE SHOULD BE NO MINIMUM

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:23.600
STANDARDS FOR THE SHELTER

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:27.170
MEDICINE. BECAUSE THESE

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:29.472
SHELTERS ARE NOT ONLY FULL

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:32.208
ABANDONED PETS WITH NO OWNERS

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.910
SOMETIMES THE SHELTERS ARE

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.278
FILLED WITH THAT'S THE

00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:38.481
HAMBURGERS AND- CONTRABAND OF

00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.784
ONE OF MY OWN PETS LOST AND

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.719
ENDED UP IN A SHELTER. I WOULD

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:44.154
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THERE WERE

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.456
SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS PRESENTS

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:48.658
AT THAT SHELTER SO THAT MIGHT

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:53.430
HAVE MY CHILD. WOULD BE TAKEN

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:55.131
CARE OF- I KNOW THAT IT'S

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:57.067
DIFFICULT WHERE WHERE SOME OF

00:53:57.133 --> 00:54:01.771
THEM THE SMALLEST. TO ME. EVEN

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:03.573
THESE MINIMUM STANDARDS AND OF

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.942
COURSE WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:08.078
ACT IN GOOD FAITH HE TRIED TO

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.547
REACH UP SOMETHING THAT WORKS

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.949
FOR ALL OF US. BUT AS AS A

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:15.418
REGULATORY BODY I THINK IT'S

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:17.120
OUR DUTY TO HAVE SOME MINIMUM

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:19.990
STANDARDS IN PLACE. IN THE

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.958
SHELTERS. HI I CERTAINLY

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:24.628
APPRECIATE- THE CANDOR AND AS

00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:25.862
SOMEONE WHO IS WHO HAS TO

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.931
RESCUE DOGS MYSELF I CERTAINLY

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:30.000
UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE- THE

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:31.835
NEED TO FOR ANIMAL SAFETY AND

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:34.270
TO ENSURE- THE LEVEL OF CARE

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:37.007
FOR OUR FOR OUR PETS- MY- MY

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.375
JOB MY GENERAL CONCERN IS JUST

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:40.477
THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF.

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:42.479
MAYBE A REGION THAT DOESN'T

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:43.413
HAVE ENOUGH VETERINARIANS OR

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.448
THIS OR THAT THAT. THE

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:47.550
POTENTIAL OF THE POSSIBLE AND

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:48.685
THESE NEW REGULATIONS BEING TOO

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:51.655
RESTRICTIVE OR TOO COSTLY THAT

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.690
MAY END UP. THE FOURTEENTH AIR

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:56.459
SHELTERS TO EITHER- CLOSER TO

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:58.361
REDUCE- THE RIPPING OF REDUCE

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:02.232
ACCESS. TO TO THE COMMUNITY SO

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:02.999
I GUESS IF YOU COULD JUST

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:05.268
CLARIFY- I HEARD THE BEGINNING

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:06.670
AND THAT THERE'S SOME ROOM FOR

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.304
IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL.

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.607
CLARIFICATION WHAT IS THE

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:11.941
PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AND

00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:14.911
WHERE WOULD- ANY POTENTIAL

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.080
REVISIONS OR ADDITIONAL INPUT

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.749
BE ADDED OR INCLUDED OR

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:23.820
PROVIDED. THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:25.055
WELL I MEAN IN REGARDS TO

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.823
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.358
DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT

00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:34.164
DEFINITELY ISN'T. THAT'S YOUR

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.133
YOUR POINT IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.868
OF AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE.

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:40.537
AND I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:42.238
RESCUERS START OFF WITH GOOD

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:44.474
INTENTIONS BUT SOME OF THEM

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:47.243
INTO SITUATIONS WHERE X. ANIMAL

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.979
HOARDING. AND THERE ARE

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:52.482
DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS- SO

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:53.650
EFFECTIVELY REMOVE ALL

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:58.054
STANDARDS. EVEN THOUGH SOME.

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.423
RIGHT RESTORED WITH THE BEST

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:01.991
INTENTION SOMETIMES THEY TURN

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:05.195
INTO. DEPLORABLE SITUATIONS OF.

00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:09.466
ANIMAL HOARDING AND ANALYTICS-

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:14.170
IF THE ON THE POSSIBLE OF WHICH

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:19.576
WORK ON. IS UTILIZING

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:23.379
REGISTERED BUT CHECK. ZERO-

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:25.849
HELLO ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.217
BECAUSE HAVE BEEN MADE BY A

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.786
VETERINARY THAT PERHAPS IS NOT

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:32.388
THERE FOR TIME BLACK CHECKS ON

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.357
THE FIRST. THEY ONCE A WEEK OR

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:38.194
ONCE A UP COUPLE OF WEEKS- THE

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:41.097
PROTOCOL IS THAT'S AND FOLLOWED

00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:44.901
THE- THINK LIKE THAT THERE'S

00:56:44.968 --> 00:56:47.604
PLENTY OF WERE THE STANDARDS

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:53.643
CAN BE MADE. MORE TO ABOUT TWO

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:55.912
AREAS THAT HAVE LESS RESOURCES.

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:59.482
SAYS ON LET ME JUST MAKE I AYE

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:04.087

STILL TO REFINE AND HONE IN ON

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:25.642
A LOT OF THE- MAYBE THESE

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:26.576
CONCERNS NOW. ESPECIALLY AS WE

BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND SILVER

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:36.519
POSING COSTLY- THE POTENTIALLY

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:39.489
COSTLY REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:41.191
YOU KNOW. THE CITY SHELTER A

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:44.661
COUNTY SHELTER NOW HOSTAGE TO-

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.496
TO RECONCILE THAT'S MY CONCERN

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:48.464
IS THERE A WAY TO US RIGHT NOW

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:56.172
TO. STILL SHAPE. THIS- THIS

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:59.075
PROCESS. YEAH SO I'LL JUMP IN

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:02.111
REAL. AND SO A COUPLE THINGS.

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:02.679
WITH THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.113
REGULAR IN THE CLAIM THESE ARE

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.382
YOU ARE IT MORE COST. AND WILL

ON OR AN FUNDS. I'M THOSE ARE

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:14.324
ARE AND THEN FOR EXISTING LAW

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:16.226
BECAUSE STATUTE STEM CELL. ARE

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:17.460
CLEAR THAT IT YOU PRACTICE

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.495
VETERINARY THEY TO BE BY. AND I

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:21.764
THINK THAT THE- REALIZE AND

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:25.201
WHEN FROM PUBLIC ON THE SEQUEL.

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:26.202
IS THAT THE- STATE ARE ALREADY

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:29.305
REALLY DID FOR SAID WITH AS A

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:29.939
THAT'S WHY THE BOARD SPENT

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:31.007
ABOUT FIVE YEAR. TRY TO FIGURE

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.809
WAYS TO LOWER AND READ. THE

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:34.410
BURDEN ON THE SHOULDERS TO

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:37.447
COMPLY. AS FAR AS TIME FRAME

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.749
THOUGH THOSE. I AS A

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:42.285
CONTROLLING YOU KNOW THE MAKING

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:44.554
IS NOW A QUICKLY. I AND THERE'S

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:46.522
AMPLE TO THE- TO PROVIDE HOME

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:48.258
COM. AND SO THE BIGGEST PORTION

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:50.393
THAT IS ONE IT GOES THROUGH THE

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.297
INITIAL YOU STAGING YES. IT'LL

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.565
HAVE A FORTY FIVE PUBLIC PERIOD

BE DONE THROUGH THE MEETINGS

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:22.158
AND- SO IT'S UNCOMMON US IN THE

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.060
MAKING. TO NOT ONLY HAVE A

QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE- DEALS

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.999
WITH THE D. E. C. I WANTED TO

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.333
JUST GET MORE BACKGROUND

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.902
INFORMATION ON- IT TO WHAT

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.672
EXTENT THAT IT BACK TO US.

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.575
ABUSE ISSUE EXIST WITHIN WITHIN

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.643
THE PRACTICE ACROSS THE STATE

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.213
OF CALIFORNIA- AND THEN ALSO

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:51.214
HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.782
REGARDING CAN CONTINUE IN

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:54.417
EDUCATION AND SCHOOL APPROVAL

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.452
PARTICULARLY- I KNOW THERE'S

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:57.887
KIND OF BEEN A SHIFT AND

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:00.490
BETTER. EDUCATION TOWARDS A ONE

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:01.991
HEALTH APPROACH IS THERE ANY

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.926
DISCUSSION THAT THE BOARD IS

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:06.462
HAVING AROUND THIS CONCEPT.

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:10.266
AND- BEING BACK THAT MORE MORE

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.302
IT'S BEEN SEEN VAX- BETTER PLAY

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:16.439
A KEY ROLE IN IN PREVENTING THE

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:19.275
FUTURE PANDEMICS- CAN YOU TELL

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:23.646
ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT.

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.348
SO TO BE ANSWERED BOTH

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:26.182
QUESTIONS FIRST YOU ASK

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.518
QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE DC AND

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:29.986
THE BEST A DIVERSION AND

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:33.056
EVALUATION COMMITTEE AND WE ARE

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.257
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:35.892
OVERSIGHT OVER THE INDIVIDUALS

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:37.193
WHO SUFFER HER INTO OUR

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.796
DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND WE DO

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:40.930
BELIEVE THAT IT'S A REALLY

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.799
CRITICAL PROGRAM FOR THOSE WHO

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:43.933
ARE EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.701
ABUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.003
HEALTHCARE PROFESSION I THINK

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.671
ONE THING THAT. THAT MAKES IT

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:50.273
STAND APART FROM OTHER HEALING

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.208
ARTS PROFESSIONS IS THAT MODERN%

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.877
AREA AND I HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.312
WRITE THE PRESCRIPTIONS AND

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.081
THEY MOST OF THEM DISPENSED

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.248
RIGHT FROM THEIR SITES AND SO

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:00.450
THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROLLED

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.952
SUBSTANCES EASY ACCESS. I'M

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.287
RIGHT THERE AND SO IF THEY'RE

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.389
EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:09.492
AND CHALLENGES THEN IT'S REALLY

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:12.361
EASY FOR THEM TO. TO YOU ACCESS

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:14.897
THOSE MEDICATIONS AND SO WE

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:15.398
FEEL THAT IT'S A REALLY

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:17.066
IMPORTANT PROGRAM.

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.935
UNFORTUNATELY IS A VERY COSTLY

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.503
PROGRAM FOR THE BOARD AS WELL

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.039
AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO DO SOME

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:26.008
OUTREACH AT. EIGHTEEN TO

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.310
ENCOURAGE MORE PARTICIPANTS IN

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.445
THIS VALUABLE PROGRAM BUT WE

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.747
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW AND

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:33.916
AFFORD IT AND SO WE ARE LOOKING

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.418
AT WHAT OTHER BOARDS ARE DOING

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.686
THAT HAVE DIVERSION PROGRAMS

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.588
THAT USE MAXIMUS THE WE TRY TO

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:40.389
A ARE ALIGNING WITH HOW THEY

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:42.058
ARE RECRUITING CLASS FOR THAT

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:49.432
AS WELL. I'M IN I'M. SORRY CAN

ANIMALS TO. HUMANS AND SO I-

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.616
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:07.283

AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.191
SOMEONE OVER DISEASES DISEASES

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:50.793
THAT CAN BE PASSED FROM ANIMALS

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.597
TO HUMANS- AND SO FORTH- I'LL

IS HAPPENING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.363
BUT ONE THING IT DID BRING TO

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:02.498
LIGHT. UP TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.133
IS THAT THESE DISEASES JOBS

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.402
AXED A VETERINARIANS DO PLAY A

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:10.139
VITAL ROLE IN HELPING NOT ONLY.

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:14.277
STOP. THE SPREAD OF DISEASE BUT

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:15.978
BEING. IN FIRST LIVE CHECK THEM

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:17.847
OF WHEN THEY APPEAR. IN EVERY

WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE. SO THE

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.954
BOARD. DECISION AS THE

THAT CONCERN BUT IT'S N ISSUE

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.428
THAT IS TOP VERY WELL IN THE

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:34.830
VETERINARY SCHOOLS- AND FORMER

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:39.702
PRACTICES SO- WE ALWAYS HAVE TO

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.371
HAPPEN ON- FRONTLINE OF.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.840
STANDING THIS COUNTRY AGAINST

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:47.176
INFECTIOUS DISEASES THERE'S SO

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.077
MANY THINGS THAT OCCUR THAT ARE

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:51.947
NOT KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT-

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:55.484
HOW THIS COUNTRY IS. A VERY

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.552
DISEASE FROM COMING TO OUR

01:05:56.619 --> 01:06:02.258
SHORES AND HOW GREAT THE STATE.

PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT- I GUESS

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.042
MY CONCERN IS ABOUT ALSO HOW DO

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:22.978
WE ADDRESS. THE DISEASES THAT

REPRESENT A VERY RURAL AND

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:32.655
AGRICULTURAL REGION AND THAT'S

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:34.457

THERE'S BEEN KIND OF A NEED TO

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.801
LOWER STANDARDS TO DEAL WITH

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:47.269
SOME OF THE ISSUES. ARE

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.337
PARTICULARLY I'M INTERESTED

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:51.307
AROUND- IT WHAT WHAT DOES THAT

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:54.210
MEAN IN TERMS OF A PRESCRIBING-

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:56.445
ANY TYPE OF MEDICATION TO

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:58.748
ANIMALS- BUT SPECIFICALLY

DEAL WITH DOGS AND CATS- BACK

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:20.569
THERE ARE VETERINARIANS TO DEAL

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:23.906
WITH- LIKE GENERAL'S- FROM

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.308
PRODUCTION CHICKENS COWS AND SO

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:29.945
FORTH- THOSE- THOSE GUYS ARE

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:31.614
REALLY REALLY ON THE FOREFRONT

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.649
OF INSPECTING. PRODUCTS

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.451
INSPECTING FACILITIES MAKING

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.453
SURE THAT I DISEASES DON'T

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.923
BREAK OUT- ONE OF THE MORE

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.758
RECENT CHALLENGES HERE YOUR

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.393
BACK LINE THAT SPECIFIC AREA

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.862
VETERINARY MEDICINE. HAS BEEN

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:50.633
THE OVER USE OF ANTIBIOTICS

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.536
AND- WHAT IS ABOUT TO. MAYBE

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:57.139
CHIU YEARS AGO OUR- AT-

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.675
DIRECTION OF GOVERNOR BROWN OF

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.710
THE ACT- PART OF OUR CONTINUING

LEAST OUR CONTINUED EDUCATION

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:10.453
ON THE JUDICIOUS USE OF

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.721
ANTIMICROBIALS SO THAT THESE

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:15.524
ANIMATICS AREN'T USED. TOO MUCH

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.227
SO AS TO LEAD TO THE

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:19.595
DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG RESISTANT

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:23.732
STRAINS OF. FACTIONS SIMPLEX

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.668
FRACTIONS. AND- BACK ALSO

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:29.572
INCLUDE FOOD- THANK THAT ARE

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:31.240
PUT INTO THE FOOD OUT OF

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:33.742
LIVESTOCK. WITH THE INTENTION

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:36.011
OF PREVENTING DISEASE BY I WE

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.347
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE MINDFUL THAT-

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:40.616
THINGS CAN DO HARM IF NOT USED

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:44.353
PROPERLY. SO IT MY HAT'S OFF TO

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.056
YOU YEAH. I AM A SMALL ANIMAL

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.991
PRACTITIONER BUT MY HAT'S OFF

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:51.260
DEFINITELY TO THE VETERINARIANS

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.229
AND RPGS WORKING FOR DHARMA

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:54.930
PRODUCTIONS BECAUSE THEY THEY

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.333
REALLY TRULY ARE AT THE VERY

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.769
FRONT OF DISEASE PREVENTION IN

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:04.473
OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. AND

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.877
MY LAST QUESTION- WHAT THEY

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:09.712
HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS THE

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:12.147
FIRST ONE IS- IN TERMS OF THE

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:14.016
INCREASE IN FEES DO YOU SEE ANY

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:17.119
IMPACT ON- ON FOOD. THE COST OF

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:20.689
FOOD AND THE SECOND. QUESTION

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:24.527
THAT I HAVE IS- WHAT ARE WHAT

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:25.594
ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:26.428
COMPLAINTS THAT THE BOARD

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.564
RECEIVES AND WHAT IS THE FOR

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:34.803
DOING TO ADDRESS THEM. BOARD

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.640
MEMBER I DON'T I DON'T.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:39.041
CONFIDENTIAL SHOULD BE TO

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:41.243
REDUCE COMPLETE PROCESS SO

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:45.281
ALTERNATIVE JESSICA. STERN SO

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:46.515
WHEN YOU COMES THE MOST COMMON

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.918
COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET I'M ONE

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.553
OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY

01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:53.756
HAVE HAD REALIZES THAT 75% OF

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.024
THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.792
ARE ALLEGING NEGLIGENCE

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.093
INCOMPETENCE UNPROFESSIONAL

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.362
CONDUCT AND OFTEN THE IT

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:02.698
UNFORTUNATELY AND HAS RESULTED

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.900
IN ANIMALS WHO HAVE HAVE PASSED

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.503
AWAY. I'M AND SO A LOT OF THESE

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.271
COMPLAINTS ARE EXTREMELY

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.739
COMPLEX BECAUSE WHEN YOU YOU

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:12.841
DEAL WITH I'M AN ANIMAL HAS

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:17.513
ALREADY- HAVE PASSED. AWAY AND

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.648
SO THERE'S A LOT OF- A MOTIONS

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.083
THAT ARE THAT ARE TIED TO THE-

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.619
AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT YOU HAVE

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:24.753
TIME. TO SAY MULTIPLE

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.288
VETERINARIANS THAT WERE

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:28.023
INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF THAT

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.458
ANIMAL AND SO WE'RE TALKING

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.060
ABOUT MULTIPLE RESPONDENTS WERE

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.828
TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE METAL

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.663
MEDICAL RECORDS AND THAT ARE

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.966
INVOLVED AND SO THERE THERE

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:39.501
ARE. A LOT HIGHER LEVEL OF

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.337
COMPLEXITY THAT TAKES A LOT OF

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.706
TIME FOR INVESTIGATIONS I AND

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.874
SO A LOT OF THEM. WHEN YOU LOOK

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.543
AT THE OVERALL GRAND SCHEME OF

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.579
THINGS THE BOARD AND ONLY TAKES

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.849
A PLAN AND IN A LOT SMALLER

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.250
PERCENTAGES OF IT BECAUSE

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:56.986
AFTER. I'M A THOROUGH

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:57.953
INVESTIGATION THAT WE

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.556
INCOMPLETE- I'M I'LL OFTENTIMES

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.458
IT HASN'T RESULTED IN IN

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:04.526
DISCIPLINARY MATTERS I'M AND

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:05.661
THE VETERINARIANS ARE MEETING

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:06.962
THE STAND UP HERE FOR THE MOST

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:09.298
USES- BUT BUT IT IS AN

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:10.566

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:07.255
SHELTERS- AND THE REGULATIONS.

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.024
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THESE

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.759
RURAL SHELTERS AT LEAST IN PART

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.527
CONTENT THEY NEED THE ABILITY

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.596
TO PERFORM. WHAT THEY DESCRIBE

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:17.065
AS LOW RISK ANIMAL CARE WITHOUT

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:19.100
VETERINARIAN OVERSIGHT SUCH AS

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:21.803
VACCINATIONS- AND IT'S MY

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:22.470
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:24.873
SUBJECT. IS ENCOMPASSED IN

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:27.175
THESE REGULATIONS THAT WERE

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:27.709
REFERENCED EARLIER IS THAT

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:37.719
CORRECT. ANYONE. YES IN THE

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.988
REGULATIONS- THAT WE ARE

01:22:40.055 --> 01:22:42.157
PROPOSING BACKS OBVIOUSLY

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:45.860
VACCINATIONS- PARASITE CONTROL-

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.196
ARE IMPORTANT IN SHELTERS AND

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:50.165
THIS- THE REGULATIONS WOULD

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.966
ALLOW FOR A VETERINARIAN TO

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:54.703
WRITE UP- PROTOCOLS AND FOR

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:57.305
SHELTER STAFF TO ADMINISTER

01:22:57.372 --> 01:23:01.242
VACCINES- USING UTILIZING THOSE

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.545

REGARDLESS IF THEY DON'T DO ANY

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:11.953
SPAY AND NEUTER BUT THEY DO

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.122
VACCINES WHICH IS CRITICAL AND

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.157
PARASITE THEY ARE UNDER THE

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:19.527
CURRENT- MINIMUM STANDARDS OF

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:20.995
VETERINARY MEDICINE FOR

FACILITIES- WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:24.833

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.468
STANDARDS FOR THOSE SHELTERS

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.703
THAT HAVE A DIFFICULTY WITH

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.739
HAVING A VETERINARIAN ON SITE.

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:34.542
FIVE AND. IN THE RURAL AREAS

CETERA. ONE MAKE SURE A BIG IT

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:37.011
CLEARS SO THE MINUTE STAY

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.380
CURRENTLY REQUIRE. THAT A

VETERINARIAN BE ON SITE IN

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:42.083
ORDER FOR THAT ACTIVITY TO

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:47.789
OCCUR. I DO NOT- JESSICA PLEASE

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:48.957
CORRECT ME BECAUSE I DON'T

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:51.126
THINK THEY REQUIRE THE

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.428
VETERINARIAN TO BE ON SITE.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:56.631
VETERINARY THE NEW MINIMUMS FOR

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.334
SHELTER MEDICINE IS THAT A

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.568
VETERINARIAN ESTABLISHES THE

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:03.471
PROTOCOLS RESULT FROM ACCIDENTS

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:06.708
YEAH- ONCE THOSE PARTICLES BEEN

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:09.043
ESTABLISHED NO NAY MAYBE POSTED

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.912
ON THE WALL THE PRESENT IN A

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:14.182
BINDER SOME PLACE THAT- THAT

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:16.151
SHELTER STAFF GEN MINISTER

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:21.556
THOSE VACCINATIONS. AND THAT'S

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:26.261
WHAT I READ ARE GOING TO ALLOW.

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.596
THAT TO CURB WITH THAT IN AND

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:30.832
HAVING TO THERE OKAY LET ME GET

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:31.866
TO MY POINT ONE OF MY- COULD

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.301
CAN. IS THE SPEED OR LACK SPEED

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:36.471
BY WHICH WE ALL OF US. REDUCE

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:39.073
REGULATIONS IN THE STATE. FROM

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.208
START TO FINISH AND THE

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:41.509
MATERIAL THAT WAS PROVIDED TO

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:42.577
US INDICATES THAT THESE

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:44.479
PARTICULAR REGULATIONS MAYBE

01:24:44.546 --> 01:24:46.448
I'M WRONG. WERE UNOFFICIALLY

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:48.616
ADOPTED OR AUTHORIZED ONE OF

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:50.351
THE OTHER. BY THE BOARD IN

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:54.823
APRIL OF- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.157
AND THE PROCESS OF FEW MINUTES

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.426
AGO IS DESCRIBED AS BEING IN

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:01.062
ITS INFANCY AND SO I GUESS MY

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.864
QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THESE

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.432
PARTICULAR REGULATIONS HAVING

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:06.468
TO DO WITH RURAL SHELTERS IS

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.069
WHEN WERE THE REGULATIONS

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.939
INITIALLY PROMULGATED. APRIL

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:11.539
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS THAT

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:15.343
FINE. AND WHY IS IT TAKING SO

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:25.320
LONG SINCE WE'RE NOW IN. TWO

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:25.887
THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. D. THE

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.655
BOARD APPROVED THE REGULATIONS

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:31.493
AND I BELIEVE IN AUGUST OF TWO

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:31.993
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT WAS

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.161
SHORTLY AFTER I STARTED WHEN I

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:34.162
STARTED IN JULY OF TWENTY

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:36.431
EIGHTEEN. AND WHEN THEY APPROVE

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:39.234
THE FINAL I AND I THINK WHAT

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.401
WHAT UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENED

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:42.370
DURING THAT TIME IS THAT WE

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:42.937
WERE GOING OVER A PERIOD F

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:44.906
TRANSITION LESS STAFF AS WELL

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.975
AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT WE ALSO

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:49.878
HAD. A LOT OF REGULATIONS THAT

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:53.147
WERE ALREADY IN QUEUE BEFORE

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:55.216
ABOUT TWENTY ONE TWENTY WILL

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:57.519
MAKING PACKAGES AND A GOOD

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:58.853
CHUNK OF THEM HAD ALREADY BEEN

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.455
I'M STARTED IN THE REVIEW

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.724
PROCESS AND SO THIS ONE AND I

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.926
AM I HAVE ONE POLICY ANALYSTS

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.895
YOU'LL HELP MOVE ALL THESE

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.530
PACKAGES THROUGH. AND SO THAT

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:10.565
PLUS DANCE IS DEVOTED TO THE

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:12.066
ALL OF THE REGULATIONS THAT

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:13.835
WERE ALREADY IN THE QUEUE AND

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:16.004
SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DEAL

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:18.206
I'M DEVELOP TRYING TO THAT THE

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:19.507
SHELTER REGULATIONS NEARLY

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:20.909
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:25.713
REGULATIONS THAT WERE. ALREADY

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.215
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. ONE

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:28.516
OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO BE A-

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:31.786
OF. BOARDS TO DO FROM PURSE- IT

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:32.287
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:34.022
REGULATORY PROCESS AND SEE HOW

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.123
WE CAN STREAMLINED AND

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:37.025
EXPEDITED. AND THE OTHER THING

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.560
I'M GOING TO BE ASKING

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:41.029
QUESTIONS ABOUT SO IT MIGHT.

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:43.031
MOVE THOE WHO WERE ASSOCIATED

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:45.733
WITH BOARDS TO START DOING THIS-

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.269
IS TO START KEEPING A- BUT AT A

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:52.840
TIME LOG. THE RECORD. FROM THE

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.409
INCEPTION OF THE REGULATION TO

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:57.078
THE FINAL ADOPTION. EXPLAINING

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.813
DELAYS IN THE PROCESS MEASURED

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.348
AGAINST YOUR TIME STANDARDS

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:02.317
WHICH I HOPE YOU HAVE FOR THE

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:03.851
ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS BECAUSE

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:04.819
I WANT TO START HAVING A

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.921
CONVERSATION ABOUT SPECIFICALLY

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:08.890
WHAT THE DELAYS ARE AND WHAT WE

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:11.225
CAN DO TO HELP YOU AS BOARDS

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:12.493
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.628
ATTEMPTING TO DO A VERY

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:15.930
DIFFICULT JOB. A MOVE THESE

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:18.132
REGULATIONS ALONG WITH A LITTLE

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:21.502
MORE- SPEED- AND EFFICIENCY I

REMINDED JUST THE OTHER DAY

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:27.775
THAT OF THE REASON YOU DO

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.243
REGULATIONS IS BECAUSE WE

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:30.545
PASSED BILLS THAT TURNED INTO

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:31.646
STATUTES THAT NEED TO BE

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:34.215
INTERPRETED AND- I AM COGNISANT

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.950
OF THAT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT.

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:37.952
AS WE MOVE OUR PRACTICE ALONG

MATT SO. AND SO WE DID IS WE

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.710

WE REALLY. SAW WE- WAS ON

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:33.427
RELIANCE ON. AND ARE. SUFFERS I

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:36.197
IT WAS ONE PRACTICE THE PAST.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.099
THAT MOST IRAQIS GO DIVISION

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.401
AND THEN A MESSAGE. HE ALSO GO

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.870
OUT FOR AND WHEN WE USED TO BE

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:45.706

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:47.275
FOR SCENES THAT WE- I'M AT THIS

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:50.011
POINT. OUR NOT NOT. SO I'M

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:52.213
WE'RE USING TO MY TO GO OUT AND

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.115

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:07.895
WE WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT AT DMI

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:09.564
IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME AND

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.766
IT'S ALSO VERY VERY EXPENSIVE.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.968
TO DEAL I'M ONE THING I THINK

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.903
THAT IS WORTH NOTING THAT. I

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.738
YES THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT THE

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:18.940
INCREASE FOR THE ATTORNEY

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.474
GENERAL'S OFFICE BUT ONE THING

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.310
FREE DENIES THERE'S A CONSTANT

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:24.879
INCREASE. EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:27.882
WE'RE UP TO PAYING ATTY ACTUALS

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:28.950

HUNDRED TWO DOLLARS PER HOUR

01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:32.620
AND THE KEY SAYS FOR DMI. AND

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:34.488
AS A LESS COMPLEX HE'S GOING TO

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:36.424
BE A MINIMUM OF TWENTY HOURS. I

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:37.725
IN SAID THAT THAT'S A

01:31:37.792 --> 01:31:39.160
SIGNIFICANT COST THERE WAS ONE

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:41.295
YEAR I BELIEVE IT WAS SIXTEEN

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:41.796
SEVENTEEN WE SPENT THREE

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:50.204
QUARTERS OF. A MILLION DOLLARS

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:50.805
ON DELIGHT CLASS. BUT I THINK

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:51.706
THAT WE WERE UNDER THE UTILIZED

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:52.807

KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR A MEDICAL

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.882
RECORDS AND SO WHAT WE REALLY

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:02.750
DID AS AS WE TRANSITIONED OUR

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:04.719
RELIANCE ON USING BOTH DIVISION

01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:06.754
INVESTIGATION AND INSPECTORS.

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:08.589

MERE FACT THAT THERE'S A

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:49.630
CONVICTION IS ENOUGH TO

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:50.665

COSTS DO YOU RECOVER. ON THE

01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:39.780
AVERAGE. SO I DON'T HAVE THAT

RECOVERY ON THE ON THE TURN

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:49.590
THAT IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.125
THAT THAT WAS POSSIBLE THE

01:38:51.191 --> 01:38:53.027
DISCIPLINE ALSO INCLUDES I'M

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:54.561

THE ONLY WE ONLY WILL SEE THOSE

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:01.869
COSTS WITH A PETITION FOR

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:04.605
REINSTATEMENT AND SO THAT'S IT

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:06.040

REHABILITATION. WAS DISCUSSED

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.025
IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER APPEARS

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:26.994
TO BE AN ISSUE. OF ANIMAL

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:28.662
PHYSICAL REHABILITATION BY

LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST AS

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:32.866
OPPOSED TO. OF VETERINARIANS

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:34.802
AND MY QUESTION IS DOES THE

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.621
YEAH I CAN I CAN ANSWER THAT

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:57.157

01:40:05.265 --> 01:40:06.633
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.736
VETERINARIAN IN THE CURRENT

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:11.038
REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE

01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:12.773
FOLLOWS. I THOUGHT THERE WAS

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.608
SOME ISSUE THAT THE BOARD'S

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:15.743
CLAIM THAT THE BOARD DIDN'T

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:18.145
HAVE AUTHORITY TO. PERMIT THAT

01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:19.880
AND THEN THERE WAS A BILL IN

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:21.215
THE BOARD OPPOSED THE BILL OF

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:23.150
LIFE. HAVE I FORGOTTEN MY

02:12:33.278 --> 02:12:34.746
DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR HANDLING

02:12:34.813 --> 02:12:36.248
OF THIS ISSUE. HAS BEEN

02:12:36.315 --> 02:12:37.616
MISLEADING INFORMATION SENT OUT

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:39.051
TO MEMBERS AND THERE SEEMS TO

02:12:39.117 --> 02:12:40.218
BE A GENERAL UNWILLINGNESS TO

02:12:40.285 --> 02:12:41.253
COLLABORATE WITH THE PHYSICAL

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.922

ANIMAL HEALTH CARE. I HAVE

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:48.060
EIGHT I SHOULD SAY I HAVE MANY

02:12:48.126 --> 02:12:50.128
COLLEAGUES NEAR AND FAR. IT

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:51.496
FEELS SIMILAR TO THE WAY I DO.

02:12:51.563 --> 02:12:52.798
IT BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE

02:12:52.864 --> 02:12:54.666
UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. WE

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:56.068
BELIEVE THE CONSERVATIVE THINK

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.369
TANK PROPERLY QUALIFIED ANIMAL

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:58.537
PHYSICAL THERAPY SHOULD BE

02:12:58.603 --> 02:13:00.138
DIRECTLY SUPERVISED BY THAT.

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:01.440

THAT WE CANNOT APPLY THE SAME

HUMAN MODEL TO ANIMALS BECAUSE-

02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:18.657
ANIMALS CAN'T VERBALIZE THEIR

SOMETHING WE'LL BE LOOKING AT

SCHOOLS TO ACTUALLY AUGMENTED

03:07:28.704 --> 03:07:31.206
THE NUMBER OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT

03:07:31.273 --> 03:07:32.541
MAYBE THEY'RE IN THE SCHOOL OR

03:07:32.608 --> 03:07:34.743
THE LACK THEREOF. AND I THINK

03:07:34.810 --> 03:07:36.278
WE FIND IT IN OUR SO MANY OF

03:07:36.345 --> 03:07:38.380
OUR SCHOOLS- YOU MAY HAVE ONE

03:07:38.447 --> 03:07:40.916
NURSE FOR FIVE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS

03:07:40.983 --> 03:07:43.485
OR YOU KNOW ONLY ONE FOR- HIGH

03:07:43.552 --> 03:07:44.720
SCHOOL WITH THREE THOUSAND

03:07:44.786 --> 03:07:46.321
KIDS. BUT RIGHT NOW THAT MENTAL

03:07:46.388 --> 03:07:47.756
HEALTH IS SUCH A AN ISSUE

03:07:47.823 --> 03:07:49.725
THAT'S ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.

03:07:49.791 --> 03:07:51.360
AND WHEN THE KIDS COME BACK

03:07:51.426 --> 03:07:52.894
THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THAT WALL

03:07:52.961 --> 03:07:55.230
IN WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND-

03:07:55.297 --> 03:07:58.367

THAT CAN. YOU KNOW SPEAK TO

03:08:00.168 --> 03:08:01.870
THESE KIDS ONE ON ONE I THINK

03:08:01.937 --> 03:08:03.672
IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVEN LONGER

03:08:03.739 --> 03:08:04.573
FOR THEM TO COME OUT OF THAT

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:07.175
SHELL. VOLUNTEER PROGRAM

03:08:07.242 --> 03:08:10.479
PARTNERSHIP. THE SCHOOLS CAN

03:08:10.545 --> 03:08:12.080
YOU ADDRESS THAT PLACE. I THINK

03:08:12.147 --> 03:08:13.482
I'M PROBABLY BEST SITUATED AS A

03:08:13.548 --> 03:08:14.916
PRACTITIONER TO ADDRESS THAT

03:08:14.983 --> 03:08:19.521
QUESTION. UP OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

03:08:19.588 --> 03:08:20.522
BEEN A MAJOR MENTAL HEALTH

03:08:20.589 --> 03:08:22.691
CRISIS HEY CAN YOU FROM TALKING

03:08:22.758 --> 03:08:25.027
TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT MANY ARE

03:08:25.093 --> 03:08:28.597
EXPERIENCING EXTREME BURNOUT-

03:08:28.664 --> 03:08:30.165
THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO TAKE A

03:08:30.232 --> 03:08:31.600
MUCH HEAVIER CASELOADS AND THEY

03:08:31.667 --> 03:08:34.069
HAD BEFORE IN SOME INSTANCES IN

03:08:34.136 --> 03:08:35.504
TRYING TO MAKE REFERRALS IN

03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:37.239
RECENT MONTHS. I'VE BEEN UNABLE

03:08:37.305 --> 03:08:38.440
TO FIND PRACTITIONERS IT COULD

03:08:38.507 --> 03:08:40.442
TAKE A REFERRAL BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:08:40.509 --> 03:08:41.710
CANCELING SO HEAVY THAT THEY

03:08:41.777 --> 03:08:43.945
COULDN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE

03:08:44.012 --> 03:08:45.013
TAKE ON AN EDUCATIONAL KLEINER

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:48.150
CLIENTS- SO THERE'S A

03:08:48.216 --> 03:08:50.552
HEALTHCARE THERE'S A CRISIS TO

03:08:50.619 --> 03:08:53.188
SOME EXTENT WITHIN THE RANKS OF

03:08:53.255 --> 03:08:54.122
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN

03:08:54.189 --> 03:08:57.259

03:08:57.325 --> 03:08:58.360
OF US RIGHT NOW. LOOK TELL YOU

03:08:58.427 --> 03:09:00.529
HOWEVER THAT- LICENSE

03:09:00.595 --> 03:09:01.530
TECHNOLOGISTS TEND TO BE VERY

03:09:01.596 --> 03:09:03.365
PRO ACTIVE IN THEIR VOLUNTEER

03:09:03.432 --> 03:09:07.102
EFFORTS- IN TERMS OF REACHING

03:09:07.169 --> 03:09:09.071
OUT TO VARIOUS COMMUNITIES-

03:09:09.137 --> 03:09:10.338
SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN

03:09:10.405 --> 03:09:11.840
HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED.

03:09:11.907 --> 03:09:13.909
POPULATION OF PSYCHOLOGISTS IS

03:09:13.975 --> 03:09:16.144
COMING TO REPRESENTS- MORE OF

03:09:16.211 --> 03:09:17.646
THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE

03:09:17.713 --> 03:09:19.481
AS OPPOSED TO. PEOPLE THAT LOOK

03:09:19.548 --> 03:09:22.617
LIKE ME- SO I THINK THERE ARE

03:09:22.684 --> 03:09:24.019
CHANGES GOING ON IN PSYCHOLOGY

03:09:24.086 --> 03:09:25.387
THAT ARE MAKING PSYCHOLOGY MORE

03:09:25.454 --> 03:09:27.189
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS. OF

03:09:27.255 --> 03:09:29.391
AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES. THAT

03:09:29.458 --> 03:09:32.160
BEING SAID WITHIN A SCHOOL

03:09:32.227 --> 03:09:32.994
SETTING WHICH YOU. WE WERE

03:09:33.061 --> 03:09:34.563
PERFECTLY FOCUSED ON THERE ARE

03:09:34.629 --> 03:09:35.630
PEOPLE THAT ARE LABELED

03:09:35.697 --> 03:09:37.666
PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT THEY ARE

03:09:37.733 --> 03:09:39.134
MASTERS LEVEL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:09:39.201 --> 03:09:40.836
CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE LICENSED

03:09:40.902 --> 03:09:41.903

PSYCHOLOGISTS- WITHIN THOSE

03:09:47.442 --> 03:09:49.578
FACILITIES SO I THINK THERE'S

03:09:49.644 --> 03:09:50.946

03:09:51.012 --> 03:09:53.682

THE WAYS THAT WE CAN BE

03:10:10.365 --> 03:10:12.367
SUPPORTIVE BUT OBVIOUSLY WORK

HEALTH. IS IT HELPFUL AND

03:14:47.776 --> 03:14:49.811
ETHICAL TO FORCE A CHILD TO

FORM A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH

03:14:51.079 --> 03:14:56.184

EXPERIENCE I CAN RELATE TO YOU

03:15:17.739 --> 03:15:18.940

03:15:19.007 --> 03:15:20.475
ONLY HARMFUL FOR THE CHILD THAT

ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED

03:15:26.648 --> 03:15:27.615

INSTEAD THE ABUSED CHILDREN

03:15:33.555 --> 03:15:34.756
HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DENY THAT

THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED. WHICH

03:15:36.057 --> 03:15:38.927
IN ITSELF IS AN ADDITIONAL FORM

03:15:38.993 --> 03:15:40.662
OF ABUSE. MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE

03:15:40.728 --> 03:15:41.529
