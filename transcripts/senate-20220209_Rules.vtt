00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.795
COMMON SITUATIONS THAT WE ISSUE-%

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:38.363
BUT WHEN AND WHAT WE DO KNOW

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.898
THAT IT'S HAPPENING ANYWHERE

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.067
INSTITUTIONS- INSTITUTIONS

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:45.237
WE DO HAVE A LIST OF THOSE

00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:46.638
INSTITUTIONS. SPECIFICALLY ON

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:48.674
OUR WEBSITE THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.742
TO ONLINE EDUCATION- BUT IT'S A

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:53.612
IT'S A MUCH BROADER BROADER LIST

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:54.946
THAN THAT- BUILDING OFF OF THAT

00:21:55.013 --> 00:21:57.082
AND ALSO RELATED TO THE LAST

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.284

SPEAKING AND YOU KNOW IT'S

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:10.228
INCREASING ISSUE FOR US AT THE

OPERATING THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE%

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:18.737
IN CALIFORNIA- WHEN INSTITUTIONS

SOLELY ONLINE INSTITUTION THAT'S

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:28.613

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.315
EASY FOR YOU TO MOVE OVER.

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:31.817
CROSSCHECK TO RENO JUST STEP

THROAT SINCE CITY NAMES- BUT THE

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:36.054

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:38.557
STUDENTS. MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUS

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.092
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:41.660
CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PROTECT

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:42.761
THOSE RESIDENTS IS INCREDIBLY

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:44.629
DIFFERENT- WHEN IT WHEN IT

BUREAU- AND I THINK IT'S

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.244

URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT AND

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.925
BUILD HEAT RESILIENCY- WHERE

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.093
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE

COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESILIENT

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:34.170
THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE REALLY

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:35.572
USE OUR DATA AND MODELING

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.208
EXPERTISE WITH A FEW OF OUR

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:40.243

IT'S HEAT OR EXTREME WEATHER OR

00:54:52.155 --> 00:54:54.357
AIR POLLUTION IT ALSO HELPS YOU

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.526
LOOK AT RISK FACTORS LIKE OLDER

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:58.028

RESILIENCY FRAME AT THE ADAPTIVE

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:06.169
CAPACITY OR THE ABILITY TO HAVE

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.304
COOL ROOFS OR OTHER THINGS THAT

ABOUT METRICS AND RESULTS BASED

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.135
ACCOUNTABILITY ASKS THE QUESTION

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:47.971
IS ANYONE BETTER OFF AND SO WE

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.506
NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:50.206
ABSOLUTELY LET'S TAKE YOUR

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.975
EXAMPLE OF THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:54.244
EFFECT ON PROPS EVEN IN YOUR

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.211
DISTRICT AND IN COASTAL

00:56:55.278 --> 00:57:00.083
FARMWORKER AREAS AND SO AS- WE-

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:02.952
IMPLEMENT. NUMBER ONE AND ITEM

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.420
IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET CLIMATE

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:06.489
SURVEILLANCE WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:07.924
TO HAVE BOTH ACCURATELY AND

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:10.693
TIMELY MEASURE WHO IS IMPACTED

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.829
BY EXTREME HEAT. AS YOU KNOW

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:13.930
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A BILL WHEN

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:16.166
YOU'RE A LAG TIME AND LOOKING AT

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:18.401
DATA FROM HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:19.903
EMERGENCY ROOM VSITS AND DATA

00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:21.704
SYSTEMS CAN KNOW. WHO MAY HAVE

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.506
BEEN HOSPITALIZED DUE TO THE

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:26.242
EFFECTS OF THE URBAN HEAT AFFECT

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.645
OR EXTREME HEAT OR WHO MAY HAVE

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:30.346
DIED FROM NOT. HAVING THAT

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:33.283
ACCURATE AND TIMELY DATA CAN

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:34.951
THEN HELP US PREVENT. FURTHER

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:37.120
IMPACTS OFEXTREME HEAT AND ALSO

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.122
BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE WE PUT

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:41.057
RESOURCES CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:42.725
TRENDS SO AS WE WORK WITH FOR

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:43.993
EXAMPLE THE NATIONAL WEATHER

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.262
SERVICE WE CAN SET TARGETS THAT

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:48.298
AREN'T JUST. BASED ON THE 95%

00:57:48.364 --> 00:57:50.233
AVERAGE OF TEMPERATURES BUT ARE

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.502
REALLY MORE TARGETED TOWARDS

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:54.304
HUMAN HEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.005
LOOK AT AIR QUALITY INDEX YOU

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:57.907
KNOW HOW THAT ON YOUR PHONE YOU

00:57:57.974 --> 00:57:59.542
KNOW WHAT THAT THE RISK IS- JUST

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.077
BY LOOKING AT THE WEATHER BUT WE

00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:01.978
DON'T HAVE THAT FOR SHE FOR

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:03.713
EXAMPLE. THE PROPOSED BUDGET

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.282
ITEMS WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:08.551
TO BETTER DOCUMENT THE IMPACT IN

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:10.687
REAL TIME. AND THEN BE ABLE TO

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.622
ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IS TO

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:14.624
PREVENT IT BY GETTING RESOURCES

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.593
ON THE GROUND SO AGAIN AND

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.328
POINTING INTO THOSE CENSUS

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:19.529
TRACTS IN YOUR DISTRICT FOR

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:21.531
EXAMPLE THAT ARE MORE IMPACTED

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:23.199
BY EXTREME HEAT. TO GET

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:25.335
RESOURCES LIKE WEATHERIZATION

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:27.370
COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS-

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:29.038
PUTTING IN TREES OR OTHER COOLEY

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:30.740
ASPECTS AND OTHER PARTNER

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:32.709
AGENCIES WORK ON. WERE SMALL AND

THOSE WHO ARE LATE TO CARE. ON

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.225

THERE CARE WASN'T GETTING BETTER

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.337
THEIR AVERAGE SUGAR THE A. ONE

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.106
C. WAS AN IMPROVING. AND THROUGH

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:32.341
BUILDING TRUST WITH THIS PERSON

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.742
AND REALIZING THAT THEY WERE

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.177
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:36.378
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:38.681
REFRIGERATE THEIR INSULIN. OR

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.583
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.485
STORE FRESH FRUIT OR VEGETABLES

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.853
AND WITH THEIR LIMITED INCOME

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.087
THEY WERE SHOPPING AT THE DOLLAR

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.022
STORE AND THAT MEANT A LOT OF

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:49.525
CARDS. AND SO IN TOOL WE ADDRESS

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:51.927

NUTRITION OR EVEN ACCESS TO LIFE

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.170
SAVING MEDICATIONS LIKE INSULIN

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.173

THROUGH MAPPING THROUGH DATA IS

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.462
TO SHOW THE DISPROPORTIONAL

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.429
IDEAS AND WHERE WE NEED TO

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.398
FOCUS. BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS SOME

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:30.966
OF THOSE UPSTREAM ROOT CAUSES

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.635
INCLUDING DISCRIMINATION IN THE

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:34.270
HEALTHCARE SECTOR KNOWING THAT

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.171
NOT ALL COMMUNITIES GET THE BALL

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.140

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:40.809
ROOM YOU MAY NOT GET THE SAME

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:42.111
AMOUNT OF ANASTASIA IF YOU'RE

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:44.980
NOT GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF. PAIN

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:47.449
MEDICATION I'M MORE THE SAME

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:51.921
ACCESS TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:52.488

AS WELL AS THE SOCIAL

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.660
ENVIRONMENT AND THE CONDITIONS.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:10:00.095
IS ONE WAY THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.196
DECREASE THAT DISPROPORTIONATE

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:04.166
ALREADY OF A VERY DOWNSTREAM

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.101
ISSUE WHY CAN'T BE PATIENTS FROM

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.070
A CHRONIC DISEASE LIKE DIABETES.

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:11.106
AND REALLY BY FUNDING PREVENTION

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:13.242
AND FUNDING THE UPSTREAM. I HOPE

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.777
WILL MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AS

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:16.779

FROM THE PARENTS I DEAL WITH.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.761

HEALTH KERR FROM OF THAT. THAT

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:21.103
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING

TO GET A MORE POSITIVE NARRATIVE

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.673
