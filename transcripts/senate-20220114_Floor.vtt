THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.965
THE CONTEXT IN WHICH ALL OF THAT

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.100
OCCURRED. THERE WAS ANOTHER A

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.903
DEATH THIS WEEK OF A AT ANOTHER

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.340
OF HIS CITY PORT J. AND I DON'T

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.775
KNOW IF ANY OF YOU I GREW UP

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:40.012
WATCHING SIDNEY PORTIER MOVIES

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.080
AND LOVING THEM. EVER WATCHING

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:44.183
WITH WITH AUDREY. IN THE BEAUTY-

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.818
AND FOR MANY PEOPLE IT WAS THE

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:47.920
FIRST TIME WE HAD SEEN AN

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.521
AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTOR AS AN

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.123
EQUAL ON THE SCREEN WITH

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.759
EVERYBODY ELSE NOT PLAYING A

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.494
SUBSERVIENT ROLE. AND I THOUGHT

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.129
ABOUT THAT AND I WATCH THIS I

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.530
REMEMBER WATCHING IT WITH MY

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:00.032
THIRTEEN YEAR ALL EYES AND THEN

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:02.368
I WATCHED IT WITH MY DAUGHTER

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:03.402
WITH HER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD I.

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:05.471
AND AS A AS A YOUNG CHILD- OF

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:09.108
COLOR. IN AND HAVING TO EXPLAIN

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:11.110
TO HER ONE YOU SAW I MEAN CITY

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.811
FORTUNE WAS SO FAMOUS BECAUSE HE

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:15.314
WAS ABLE TO HOLD. HIS GRADES HE

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.283
WAS ABLE TO NOT REACT. AS THE

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.718
ONLY ONE WHO WAS IN A IN A

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:20.986
SITUATION AS THE AS IF THE FIRST

00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:22.821
AND THE ONLY WHEN HE WAS. EITHER

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.189
IS IT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THEY

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.292
CALL ME SIR OR CALL ME MISTER

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.093
TIBBS. ALL OF THOSE FILMS. WHERE

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.062
WE SAW THAT HE WOULD JUST. TAKE

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:33.399
AN INSULT. AND NOT REACT. BUT

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.600
CERTAINLY NOT LET IT BE OKAY.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:35.834
AND THAT WAS THE CONTEXT IN

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:37.002
WHICH DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:38.904
DOING THIS ORGANIZING. WERE FOR

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.906
SO MANY IT WAS A PLACE THEY

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:43.108
COULDN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:44.843
BUT FOR SO MANY WHO WERE BRAVE

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.112
WHO KNOWS- EQUALITY WAS WAS

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.081
BETTER FOR ALL OF US. THAT

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:51.116
AWARENESS AND VISIBILITY WAS

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:53.686
BETTER FOR ALL OF US AT THE MORE

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.953
INTEGRATED WE COULD BE. THEN THE

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.088
MORE THAT WE COULD SEE THAT WE

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:58.057
ARE SO MORE. ALIKE THAN WE ARE

00:15:58.123 --> 00:15:59.825
DIFFERENT. AND THAT'S WHAT DR

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:01.427
MARTIN LUTHER KING STOOD FOR

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.195
RIGHT THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE OUR

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:04.930
PLACE THAT WE CAN ALL BE SEEN

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:07.266
THAT IT IS NOT SCARY. FOR US TO

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.002
BE DIFFERENT. HE WAS A REVERENT

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:13.339
OF JUSTICE VERSUS A REVERENT OF.

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:16.175
EXCLUSION HE WAS SOMEONE WHO.

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:17.776
TAUGHT US ABOUT THAT IDEAL AND

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.812
TRY TO LEAD US TO JUSTICE.

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.580
RATHER THAN LEADING US INTO

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.816
DIVISION INTO OUR CORNERS. IF WE

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.150
CAN REMEMBER ANYTHING AS WE

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:27.319
HONOR HIS BIRTH. TO REMEMBER HIS

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:29.722
LEGACY. AND REMEMBER THE CONTEXT

GIVE AFRICAN CANCER RIGHT AFTER

THE CIVIL WAR. AND BACK THEN

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:42.213
THERE WERE LOTS OF BENEFITS THAT

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.381
CAME FROM THAT THE ABILITY TO

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:45.383
VOTE. AFRICAN AMERICANS GOT TO

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.218

SPECIFICALLY THE NIGHT TO

00:29:57.362 --> 00:30:00.064
PREVENT THEM THE VOTE. AND THE-

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:02.267
ABILITY TO INTEGRATE IN SOCIETY

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:04.702
HAVE THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. TO

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.538
ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS IS THERE

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:08.006
ANYONE ELSE WHO GAVE RISE TO

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:10.542
CLUE KLUX KLAN. THEY GAVE RISE

00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:12.210
TO SYMBOLS OF PEOPLE THAT ONCE

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:14.712
WERE CONSIDERED TREASONOUS AND

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:17.282
ONCE WERE CONSIDERED. TO BE

00:30:17.348 --> 00:30:19.551
TRIED FOR TREASON FOR THEIR

00:30:19.617 --> 00:30:21.819
CRIMES AGAINST. THE UNITED

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:23.354
STATES IN THOSE SYMBOLS BECAME

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:26.391
PERVASIVE IN THE SOUTH INCLUDING

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:28.860
THE CONFEDERATE FLAG. GROWING UP

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:30.962
I REMEMBER SEEING THE

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:33.164
CONFEDERATE FLAG ON TELEVISION

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:37.869
SHOWS. REMOTE INTO SOMETHING- A

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:39.704
REPRESENTATIVE OF A PLACE

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:43.107
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE-

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:44.776
REMEMBERED WITH FOND MEMORIES OR

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:47.845
- YOU KNOW POSITIVE- IDEAS

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:49.180
ASSOCIATED WITH A VERY NEGATIVE

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:52.050
CONCEPT MOST OF THOSE WERE VERY

00:30:52.116 --> 00:30:55.954
INTERESTING MARKETING- OR OR OR

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.389
STRATEGIES TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S

00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:01.559
VIEWS ABOUT WHAT THE CIVIL WAR

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:03.761
ACTUALLY WAS AND WHAT IT

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:08.633
REPRESENTED. THERE WERE. THERE

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.935
IF YOU ALL HEARD THE TERM

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:12.770
CARPETBAGGER. CARPETBAGGERS WERE

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:15.940
ACTUALLY PEOPLE THAT WENT TO THE

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:18.276
SOUTH TO PROVIDE EDUCATION BUILD

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:20.545
SCHOOLS HELP TO REBUILD THE

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:23.982
SOUTH AND TO HELP BUILD HOUSING

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:25.650
FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.185
DISPLACED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:28.720
REPRESENTED RECONSTRUCTION THEY

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:31.389
WERE VILIFIED AND OFTENTIMES

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:34.459
TORTURED AND KILLED AND THAT

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:36.494
TERM CARPETBAGGER CAME TO BE

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:38.263
VIEWED AS SOMEBODY FROM THE

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:39.697
OUTSIDE THAT WASN'T WELCOME AND

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:42.233
THAT WAS ORIGINATED IN THE SOUTH

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.103
AND IT CAME TO SPEAK. ABOUT WHAT

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:47.605
GREAT ABILITY THEY HAD TO

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:50.775
INSTITUTIONALIZE. NEGATIVE

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:53.211
THINGS INTO POSITIVE THINGS AND

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:55.246
THAT GAVE RISE TO MARTIN LUTHER

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:58.116
KING AND IT WAS. WHEN HE FACED

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.451
EVERY MANNER OF DISCRIMINATION

00:32:00.518 --> 00:32:01.753
AND THREATS AGAINST HIS LIFE

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:04.789
OFTENTIMES BEING PURSUED AND

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:07.592
SEEN AS A THREAT BY HIS OWN.

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:09.327
GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS A

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:12.096
REMINDER TO US THAT EVEN IF

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.965
SOMETHING HAPPENED A HUNDRED

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:16.801
YEARS AGO WERE FIFTY YEARS AGO.

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.369
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE'S

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.204
MINDS HAVE BEEN CHANGED AND

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.639
THINGS HAVE IMPROVED FOR THE

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:23.775
BETTER AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE NO

00:32:23.841 --> 00:32:25.977
LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:27.111
THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT LADIES

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:28.513

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:31.582
ATTACK TODAY. IN PLACES LIKE

TEXAS. NATIVE BUT THE CHILDREN

YEARS OF GRINDING WORK TOWARDS

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:09.967

SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. THAT WOULD

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:30.555

IN HOUSING. DR KING WON

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.438
CONCESSIONS FROM THE CITY. A

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:49.607
VICTORY THAT HE CALLED THE FIRST

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:52.209
STEP IN A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:54.478
MILES. AS PART OF A DRESSING

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.647
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS WE

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.416
HAVE TAKEN OUR OWN STEPS IN

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.284
THEIR JOURNEY HOWEVER A

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:02.286
BEGINNING. IN ELIMINATING

00:37:02.353 --> 00:37:04.188
BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR

00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:05.990
THAT HAVE FACED IN FINDING THEIR

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:07.692
OWN HOMES AND ALLOWING MORE

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:09.427
FAMILIES TO START BUILDING

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:11.996
WEALTH INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:17.568
pHEIRS. THIS PANDEMIC HAS SHINED

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:19.670
A GLARINGLIGHT ON THE

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:20.805
INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.873
SYSTEM. AND EVEN AS WE CONTINUE

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.709
ADDING MORE CALIFORNIANS TO OUR

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.911
HEALTH CARE ROLES WE MUST

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.879
ADDRESS THOSE INEQUITIES BOTH

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:31.082
DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND BEYOND.

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:33.117
IN FACT DEEPLY EXAMINING

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.720
INEQUITIES HAS BECOME IN PART

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.722
BECAUSE OF THESE EARTHQUAKES

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:39.924
BECAUSE OF THESE HAPPENINGS.

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:42.159
THAT I TALKED ABOUT. A CONSTANT

00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:43.561
PRIORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:45.563
STATE SENATE I BELIEVE AND I

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.398
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:48.933
BILLS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.268

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:52.937
AND BEYOND WILL BE VIEWED

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:55.039
THROUGH A REAL LANDS OF EQUITY.

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.074
BUT IT IS UP TO US TO MAKE SURE

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:59.410
THAT CONTINUES TO BE TRUE. SO

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:01.912
YES WHILE THERE IS A LOT OF HARD

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:04.315
WORK YES TO DO. AND OTHER ISSUES

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:07.284
CERTAINLY REMAIN. THIS YEAR

REALLY DOES FEEL DIFFERENT TO ME

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:10.254
. AND I THINK WE HAVE THE

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.922
OPPORTUNITY IF WE KEEP WORKING

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:13.457
TOGETHER TO INSURE IT IS

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:15.660
DIFFERENT IT IS DIFFERENT IN

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.995
TERMS OF HOW WE CAN TRULY HONOR

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.997
THE LIFE AND LEGACY AND

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:22.199
CERTAINLY ADVANCE THAT LEGACY OF

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.934
THE REVEREND DR MARTIN LUTHER

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:26.337
KING JUNIOR. BUT IT'S ONLY IF WE

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:28.539
KEEP IT IN FOCUS IT IS ONLY IF

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.274

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.176
CAN GROW ON SOME OF THE

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.878

00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.716
WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY OF OUR

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.384

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.031
