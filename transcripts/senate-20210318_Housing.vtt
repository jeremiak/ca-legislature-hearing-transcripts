00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:46.416
COMMISSION WAS STRUGGLING A BIT

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.851
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOLD OPEN

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:49.586
MEETINGS. BECAUSE THAT

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:50.921
APPLICABLE STATE OPEN MEETING

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.489
ACT REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:53.990

TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS- WE-

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.662
SOLVE THAT BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR

00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.963
ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.798
WAIVING THAT REQUIREMENT BUT IT

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:03.967
MADE US AWARE OF THE FACT THAT-

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.168
COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:06.303
WE'RE GONNA BE FACING THE SAME

DEVELOP AND TURN AROUND A

00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:16.780
RECOMMENDATION WITH SIMILAR

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:17.981
FACT FOR COMMON INTEREST

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:23.754
DEVELOPMENT MEETINGS. IT WAS

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:24.921
INTENTIONALLY NARROW. THE ONLY

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:28.425
THAT IT. WHEN CAN PURCHASE

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.193

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.630
IDEA WELL WE ADDED. PROCEDURAL

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.632
ROUTE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NAY

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.501
AFFECTED THE WAIVER WOULD NOT

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:41.004
UNDULY INTERFERE WITH MEMBERS

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:41.638
ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.840
MEETINGS. AND FINALLY WE-

00:50:43.907 --> 00:50:44.941
RECOMMENDED THAT IT BE AN

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:47.611
URGENCY MEASURE BECAUSE IN OUR

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:49.513

THE YOUNG PERSON REQUIREMENTS.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.156
AND THAT CASTS A SORT OF A

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:01.525
CLOUD ON THE LEGITIMACY OF

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:02.225
ACTIONS TAKEN AT THOSE

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:04.394
MEETINGS. AND THE COMMISSION

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:06.496
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS URGENT TO

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.864
PUT A FIX IN AS QUICKLY AS

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:09.666

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:31.294
ALLOW YOU TO RECORD IT SO THAT

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.095
IF I'M BUSY WHEN THE MEETINGS

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.630
BEING HELD AND I WANT TO SEE IT

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:36.098
THE NEXT MORNING OR SOMETHING

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:38.000
THAT I HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.335
AND I DO THINK THERE SHOULD BE

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:41.103
SOME ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IF

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.005
THE RULES ARE VIOLATED THERE

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.508
SHOULD BE A WAY FOR ONE OF THE

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:49.245
MEMBERS OF THE- C. ID TO FILE A

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.647
COMPLAINT OR A CHALLENGE AND

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.716
THAT IT BE HEARD SOMEWHERE SO-

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.485
WHETHER IT'S THAT BROWN ACT-

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:58.487
ABABNEH PROCESSOR OR SOMETHING

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.089
ELSE I'M NEUTRAL ON THAT BUT I

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:04.126
DO. THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:04.727
SOME KIND OF REMEDY. SHE OF

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.929
HAVING TO GO COURT LEAST. BUT I

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.798
WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.032
AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'M

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.233
PREPARED TO MOVE THE BILL IF

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.703
THAT'S APPROPRIATE OKAY SO THAT

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:18.574
IS A- BUT MOTION. TO DISMISS.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.643
THE PATH AS AMENDED AND RE

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.379
REFER TO THE COMMANDED A SHORT

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.981
BREATH- CENTER ACCOUNTS. I TO

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.817
SIT ON JUDICIARY SELFIE SEEN

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:30.419
THIS AGAIN BUT- I WAS THE

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:33.022
AUTHOR OF THE H. AWAY CHANGES

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.623
THAT REQUIRE PHYSICAL PRESENCE

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.058
AND FOR COUNTING OF BALLOTS

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.227
THAT THERE WAS. A LOT OF PAIN

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.328
AND SUFFERING THAT WENT THROUGH

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:41.297
GETTING THOSE CHANGES TO THE H.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.466
AWAY SO I GUESS I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:46.635
HERE RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:51.640
FROM RURAL SALINAS- WHAT YOU'RE-

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:52.208
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ON THE

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:54.443
BILL- IT'S BECAUSE- BEEN. COME

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:56.545
UP AND THE ALLEGE IT'S SUCH AN

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:57.947
INTEGRAL OF THE CHANGES THAT WE

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.882
HAVE ON THE OPERATIONS OF A

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.318
CHOICE. HI MISTER CHAIR DO I

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.519
HAVE PERMISSION TO RESPOND

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:05.821
DRIVE JUST CRIED- SO THIS IS

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:07.556
SOMETHING I'M HAPPY TO HAVE MY

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:09.024
WITNESSES WHEN HERE'S WELL BUT

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.559
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS.

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:13.529
CONSIDERED AND I WAS RAISED IN

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:14.397
MEETINGS WITH A LOT OF YOU

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.732
COMMISSION BUT- I THINK

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.134
ULTIMATELY THERE WERE CONCERNS

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.702
ON THE FLIP SIDE WHICH IS IN A

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.771
IN A CURRENT PANDEMIC. FOURTEEN

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:23.706
A WILDFIRE A PHYSICAL LOCATION

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.408
ACTUALLY WOULD EXCLUDE A LOT OF

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:27.109
PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING.

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.611
BECAUSE THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:29.712
FOLKS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:31.914
RELUCTANT TO COME TO IN PERSON

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:32.982
BOKE TABULATIONS OR ANYTHING

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.717
LIKE THAT. OR OR MAY NOT BE

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.118
ABLE TO DURING CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:37.286
EMERGENCIES RIGHT AND AGAIN

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.121
THIS IS A PERMISSIVE MEASURE.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.222
THAT ONLY APPLIES WHEN THERE'S

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:41.624
AN OFFICIAL THE CARD MERGING

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.793
SEA- AND SO I THINK THE THOUGHT

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.861
WAS THAT A TELECOM VIDEO

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:48.030
CONFERENCE. WHERE THE VOTES

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.599
WERE ACTUALLY SEEN OVER CAMERAS

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.569
WOULDBE. MORE PARTICIPATORY

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:55.905
THEN IN IN PERSON UNDER CERTAIN

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.940
CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THAT WAS

01:07:58.007 --> 01:08:00.976
THE THINKING BEHIND IT- AND SO

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:02.144
YOU KNOW IS JUST KIND OF A

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.879
TRADE OFF THING BUT OF COURSE I

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.582
HIGH VALUE. YOU KNOW I I'VE YOU

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.350
HOAS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FORM

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.718
OF DEMOCRACY AND WE ARE NOT IN

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.353
THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO TRY TO.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.521
DISENFRANCHISE ANYONE OR TAKE

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:13.989
AWAY AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.925
PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY SO

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:16.492
WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH

01:08:16.559 --> 01:08:17.927
THESE CONCERNS I THINK. I'M

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:18.928
WALKING YOU THROUGH THE

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:20.229
REASONING THAT WE HAD AND I

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:25.067
DEFINITELY WOULD LIKE. TO HAVE

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:25.868
OUR WITNESSES RESPOND AS WELL.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.805
WHICH ONE. I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.074
THE LARA MISTER HAGER FIRST.

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:35.377
OKAY YES SHARKS SURE I CAN

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.112
SPEAK TO THE COMMISSION'S

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.981
THINKING ON THOSE- WHEN WE'RE

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.716
DEVELOPING OUR PROPOSAL THE

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.518
ISSUE WAS RAISED BY MISTER AT

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.520
THAT TIME. WHEN WE DID DISCUSS

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.322
IT AND IT WAS SENT TO THE

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:47.957
COMMISSION THE MATH THAT THAT

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:51.293
SENATOR MAN DESCRIBES. COUNTING

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:51.827
THE BALLOTS IN FRONT THE

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:54.697
CAMERAS WHATEVER CAN SEE.

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:56.732
WHAT'S ON THE PAPER AS IT'S

01:08:56.799 --> 01:09:01.036
BEING READ BY THE INSPECTOR.

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:03.105
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO. THE

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:07.810
TERM FRAUDULENT- WHICH WE GUESS

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:08.377
BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THAT

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:11.547
REQUIREMENT- I UNDERSTOOD COULD

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:12.715
SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.149
MISSIONARY BUT SHE'S WORRIED

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.751
THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.987
ABLE TO SEE THE BALLOT EVEN ON

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.455
A CAMERA BECAUSE THEY'RE-

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:22.291
PARTICIPATING BY TELEPHONE AND

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:25.761
I. UNDERSTAND THAT AND- THE

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:26.795
JUDGMENT CALL THAT POINT THE

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:30.032
COMMISSION WAS FOCUSED ON

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.267
KEEPING THE BILL'S VERY NARROW.

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.168
TICKETS ARE BECAUSE WE WERE

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:34.236
HOPING TO HAVE THE PASS ON

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:37.740
EMERGENCY BILLS ITSELF. WE

01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:39.575
WEREN'T PERSUADED AT THAT POINT

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.710
THAT MORE WAS NEEDED THAT.

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:44.346
EXCEPT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:48.751
THE SIDE. FRESHEN UP YEAH I

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:51.053
THINK THE I THINK THIS OF.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.589
MISTER CHAIR I AM AND IT'S ODD

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.024
HOW THE PANDEMIC IS WORKING

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.126
ISN'T WHAT WE THINK WORK WHAT

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.460
MY THINKING WAS IN OCTOBER IS

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.563
DIFFERENT TO MY THINKING AND IN

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:02.097
MARCH SO. I'M GOING TO JUST

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:03.566
STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.868
I GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT AGAIN

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:08.737
AND- AS IN TO DISH JERRY IN

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:11.473
FULL. I WANT TO SCREW UP A

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.042
LITTLE BIT. AND WE'D BE HAPPY

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:16.178
INTERACT WITH YOUR STAFF. IS

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:18.247
THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.882
COUNCIL TO SPEAK. NOW I THINK

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:25.921
WERE I THINK WE'RE OKAY- SO-

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:26.555
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:29.124
COLLEAGUES. OKAY WE DO A

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:32.127
MOTION- TO PASS TO JUDICIARY AS

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:32.928
AMENDED I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:35.831
VOTE. ON THIS BILL AND I WANT

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.200
TO THANK CENTERMAN FOR WORKING

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:39.134
WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND FOR

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:41.003
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH US

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.106
STAKEHOLDERS SO. WE DO HAVE THE

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.275
MOTION AND WE WILL CALL A NINE

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:46.842
I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.611
CLOSE WITH YES I JUST WANTED TO

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:49.979
BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE RECORDING

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:52.381
ISSUE- MY STAFF IS RAISED TO MY

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.516
ATTENTION THAT THIS WOULD

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.185
REQUIRE A CHANGE OF THE LAW.

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:57.620
BECAUSE HOAS RIGHT NOW ARE NOT

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:58.587
REQUIRED TO RECORD THEIR

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.389
MEETING SO I THINK THE GOAL

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:03.492
HERE WAS AGAIN- AS A MYSTERY

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.728
THERE SAID TO KEEP THIS NARROW

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:06.962
SINCE IT'S AN URGENCY MEASURES

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.197
SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE

01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:10.199
MASSIVE CHANGES TO LAW HERE-

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:11.200
AND SO THAT WAS OUR REASONING

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:12.801
BEHIND NOT REQUIRING RECORDINGS

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.036
AND AGAIN THIS IS MEANT TO JUST

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.537
APPLYING A VERY NARROW SET OF

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.473
CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS TODAY.

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:19.375
WHEN H. AWAY CAN'T HAVE NAME

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:20.743
EIGHT IT WORKS DIFFICULT OR

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.211
PROBLEMATIC FOR NATURE WAY TO

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:24.079
HAVE AN IN PERSON MEETING UP

01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:25.648

ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF MEETING-

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:36.158

GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.627
GOVERNMENTS OF COURSE BUT- HOAS

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:39.962

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:46.268
GOVERNMENT AS WELL AND. AND I

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:46.869

THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:57.059
GOVERNMENTS HAVE THUS FAR

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:57.860
APPROVED THE PROJECT. THAT IS

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:00.028
TAKEN IT OF THE DENSITY BONUS

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.164
BUILT IN SINCE ALMOST ALL

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.866
HOUSING IN THE STATE IS IN

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:08.503
FACT. IN OUR- PAID FOR BY

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.139
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPERS IF

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.808
THEY'RE NOT UTILIZING SUCH A

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:14.142
TOOL IS THIS IN A FAR LOCAL

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.210
GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT UTILIZING

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:17.246
SUCH A TOOL IS THIS THEN WE ARE

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:18.447
BUILDING LESS AFFORDABLE

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:20.148
HOUSING AND WE NEED TO BUILD

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:21.850
ALL HOUSING BUT AFFORDABLE

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.785
HOUSING ADDITIONALLY. THE GOAL

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.120
OF S. B. TWO NINETY IS TO

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.622
CLARIFY AND IMPROVE OUR DENSITY

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:29.091
BONUS LAW SO THAT ACTUALLY

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.493
INCREASES OR RESULTS IN AN

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.929
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:36.131
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.432
ARE BUILT IN OUR STATE AND

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.067
ESPECIALLY WITHIN THESE MARKET

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:41.303
RATE PROJECTS. TO IMPROVE THE

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:44.106
ABILITY FOR FIVE FOUR RATHER

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:46.875
DESSERTS PROVISIONS IT CONFORMS

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:48.510
THE DENSITY BONUS APPROVAL

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:50.412
WHICH REQUIREMENTS IN OUR

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.447
EXISTING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:55.150
ACT IT EXPANDS THE DEFINITION

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.419
OF FOR SALE PROJECTS BEYOND

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:58.987
COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS SO

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.989
IT INCLUDES THE IT UNITS FOR

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.091
LOW INCOME FAMILIES. IT ADDS A

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.360
PARKING WAIVER FOR SALE

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.529
PROJECTS THAT ARE WITHIN A HALF

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:10.532
A MILE OF TRANSIT IN INCLUDE

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:14.002
40% OF MODERATE INCOME UNITS.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.238
AND IT. IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:18.073
THE DENSITY BONUS TO BE USED

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.841
FOR STUDENT HOUSING WHICH IT

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.677
CURRENTLY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.645
USE IT BECAUSE STUDENT HOUSING.

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:27.816
IS ARE. USUALLY DESIGNED. NOT

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.185
AS A IF YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.321
DORMITORY STYLE HOUSING WHEN

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.256
THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUILD

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:36.391
STUDENT HOUSING THEY MAY PUT A

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:39.261
NUMBER OF QUOTE UNQUOTE UNITS

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.429
ON THE FLOOR BUT ONLY ONE

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:43.632
KITCHEN. AND WE NEED TO MAKE

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:45.901
THESE ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE THE

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:47.636
WAY OUR USUAL CONFIGURATIONS

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.338
ARE SUCH THAT A UNIT MUST BE

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:50.872
YOU KNOW X. NUMBER OF OOMS IN

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.541
THE KITCHEN AND NOT IN A

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:56.611
DORMITORY STYLE- CONFIGURATION

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:57.813
SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:00.849
ENABLE. A DEVELOPER TO GET UP

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:01.883
TO ONE INCENTIVE FOR UNDER THE

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.086
DENSITY BONUS BILL IF 20% OF

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:06.521
THE UNITS ARE FOR LOW INCOME

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:09.157
STUDENTS WITHIN A STUDENT

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:09.658
HOUSING CONFIGURED TYPE

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:11.827
PROJECT- SO THAT'S WHAT THE

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:13.729
BILL DOES AND I HAVE- TWO

YEARS I BUILT CLOSE TO FIVE

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:05.914
HUNDRED APARTMENTS OF WHICH

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:10.218
ALMOST A HUNDRED WERE SET ASIDE.

01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:12.154
FOR LOW INCOME. AS A RESULT OF

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.655
THE DENSITY BONUS PROVISIONS

AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:17.359
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DENSITY

BONUS LAW THE BUILDING THOSE A

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:23.198
HUNDRED OR SO UNITS- WE BECAME

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:25.767
A LARGER A LANDLORD OF LOW

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:27.235

TAX ROLLS OF THE DENSITY BONUS

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:37.179
HAS BEEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:40.449
WAY TO GET PRIVATE DEVELOPERS

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:43.618
TO BUILD. LOW INCOME HOUSING-

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.487
I'VE ALSO USED THE HOURS ALSO-

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.688
THE FIRST BALLOT PRETTY USING

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.722
DENSITY BALLOTS AND SAN

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:50.492
FRANCISCO. BACK IN TWENTY

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.326
SIXTEEN AND SINCE THEN I THINK

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.095
ANOTHER THOUSAND OR MORE

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:55.197
PROJECTS HAVE UTILIZED THAT SO

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.499
IT'S AN EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:00.702
THAT THAT- I THINK SHOULD BE

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:03.105
ENHANCED IN WHATEVER WAY IT CAN

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:04.506
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED WHEN I

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.141
WAS IN BERKELEY. THIS IS THAT

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:07.776
OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF

WHICH THERE ARE MANY NOW-

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:12.214
CANNOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE

LOW INCOME UNITS PROVIDED BY

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.283
THE DENSITY BONUS BECAUSE

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:17.853
THERE'S NO PROVISION TO ALLOW

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:21.256
STUDENTS. TO RENT AN APARTMENT-

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:22.824

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:26.862

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.764
SCANNERS- LEGISLATION TODAY

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:32.334

IN CHANGING THAT. AND ALLOWING

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:36.671
STUDENTS TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:39.074
THE POTENTIAL TO BE IN

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.009
SUBSIDIZED BELOW MARKET RATE

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:43.411

02:19:48.747 --> 02:19:50.582
THIS BILL DIFFERS TO LOCAL

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:54.119
DECISION MAKING. THE BILL BUT

02:19:54.185 --> 02:19:56.020
THE BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY

02:19:56.087 --> 02:19:58.123
PREVENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM

02:19:58.189 --> 02:19:59.691
BEING BUILT PURSUANT TO AN S.

02:19:59.758 --> 02:20:06.931

FOR THE AUTHOR- CENTER WIENER

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:15.673
THE OTHER ISSUE IS ON THE

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.041
VOLUNTARY WITH THIS IS

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:19.043
PROVIDING FOR EXAMPLE CITY

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:20.578
COUNCILS A TOOL TO BE ABLE TO

02:20:20.645 --> 02:20:22.847
USE IT'S NOT MANDATORY BUT IF

02:20:22.914 --> 02:20:24.649
THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO USE

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:27.619
THIS. THEY COULD UTILIZE THIS

02:20:27.685 --> 02:20:29.187
IN YOUR COMMUNITY BUT IT WOULD

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:30.855
BE UP TO THAT COUNCIL CORRECT

02:20:30.922 --> 02:20:32.390
CORRECT THIS IS A PURELY

02:20:32.457 --> 02:20:34.425
VOLUNTARY TOOL CITY CAN IGNORE

02:20:34.492 --> 02:20:36.461
ENTIRELY AND THEN IT HAS NO

02:20:36.528 --> 02:20:38.363
EFFECT AT ALL IN THAT CITY- OR

02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:40.598
THE CITY COUNCIL CAN DECIDE TO

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:42.600
UTILIZE- I THINK THEY'RE ONE OF

02:20:42.667 --> 02:20:46.304
THE THINGS WE- PLACE

02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:47.338
REQUIREMENTS ON CITIES AROUND

02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:48.606
HOUSING AND I THINK IT'S VERY

02:20:48.673 --> 02:20:50.208
IMPORTANT HOUSING IS A-

02:20:50.275 --> 02:20:51.876
IMPORTANT STATEWIDE ISSUE AND-

02:20:51.943 --> 02:20:53.411
THERE NEED TO BE STATEWIDE

02:20:53.478 --> 02:20:55.013
STANDARDS FOR PRODUCTION OF

02:20:55.079 --> 02:20:58.383
HOUSING- BUT WE ALSO. SOMETIMES

02:20:58.449 --> 02:21:00.151
MAKE IT HARD ON CITIES WE DID

02:21:00.218 --> 02:21:01.719
THAT WE TOOK REDEVELOPMENT AWAY

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:03.955
FOR EXAMPLE NONE AND WE TELL

02:21:04.022 --> 02:21:05.690
CITIES WE WANT THEM TO REZONE

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:07.625
FOR MORE HOUSING IN SUSTAINABLE

02:21:07.692 --> 02:21:09.661
AREAS BUT THEN WE MAKE A REALLY

02:21:09.727 --> 02:21:11.162
LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE AND

02:21:11.229 --> 02:21:13.531
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THAT

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:14.899
AS THE TIME IS GIVING US

02:21:14.966 --> 02:21:16.768
VOLUNTARY TOOL FOR CITIES IF

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:18.603
THEY CHOOSE TO USE THAT. TO

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:23.241
HAVE A FASTER- AND- MORE- COST

02:21:23.308 --> 02:21:28.713
EFFECTIVE. WAY OF DOING IT.

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:29.280

02:21:33.985 --> 02:21:35.854

THE FIRE MARSHAL. CERTIFIES

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:28.573
THAT A CERTAIN AREA BASICALLY

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:30.909
HAS THE SUPPLIERS SEVERITY RISK

02:22:36.147 --> 02:22:37.582
HOUSE TO CERTIFY THAT OTHERWISE

02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:39.050
YOU CAN'T BUILDING THOSE ARMS.

02:22:39.117 --> 02:22:40.151
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE

02:22:40.218 --> 02:22:41.552
OTHER SENATE HOUSING BILLS IN

02:22:41.619 --> 02:22:46.524

WE WERE FINISHED CRAP. THANK

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:11.015
YOU MADAM CHAIR ARM. I JUST

02:23:11.082 --> 02:23:12.150
WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS

02:23:12.216 --> 02:23:19.023
ABOUT THE BILL- FIVE THE

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:21.192
OPPOSITION THAT CALLED IN WE

02:23:21.259 --> 02:23:22.927
CLEARLY KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:23:22.994 --> 02:23:25.330
RESIDENTS IN COMMUNITIES

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:28.166
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO- ARE.

02:23:28.232 --> 02:23:31.369
VERY VERY RESISTANT TO ZONING

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:34.038
CHANGES. BUT I WANT TO NOTE

02:23:34.105 --> 02:23:38.576
THAT. A GOOD REASON OR IT COULD

02:23:38.643 --> 02:23:42.714
BE. A LARGE PART OF WHY WE HAVE

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:45.650
SUCH A HOUSING SUPPLY SHORTAGE

02:23:45.717 --> 02:23:49.120
IS BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:52.623
AMOUNT OF LAND WITHIN OUR URBAN

02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:55.693
AND SUBURBAN AREAS THAT ARE.

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:59.030
ZONED SINGLE FAMILY AND ONLY

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:01.666
SINGLE FAMILY AND AS A RESULT

02:24:01.733 --> 02:24:03.034
WE'VE RESTRICTED THOSE

02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:05.069
RESTRICTIONS HAVE LEFT SUCH

02:24:05.136 --> 02:24:07.205
LITTLE WAY ON ESPECIALLY IN OUR

02:24:07.271 --> 02:24:09.874
JOB RICH AREAS AND TRANSIT

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:12.310
AREAS AS THIS BILL PUTS OUT. TO

02:24:12.377 --> 02:24:16.814
BE- MULTI FAMILY OF ANY SIZE.

02:24:16.881 --> 02:24:18.750
AND WE HAVE GROWN IN JOBS IN

02:24:18.816 --> 02:24:20.585
GROWN IN POPULATION THAT WE

02:24:20.651 --> 02:24:22.420
HAVE THIS TERRIBLE HOUSING

02:24:22.487 --> 02:24:24.255
SHORTAGE IT ISN'T THAT WE

02:24:24.322 --> 02:24:26.657
HAVEN'T HAD INVESTORS WILLING

02:24:26.724 --> 02:24:29.093
TO BUILD HOUSING IT ISN'T FOR

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.628
THEIR SO MANY OTHER REASONS

02:24:30.695 --> 02:24:32.897
WE'VE HAD LOTS OF DESIRE WE

02:24:32.964 --> 02:24:34.365
HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY

02:24:34.432 --> 02:24:36.267
HOUSING WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:40.405
TO LIVE- WHO NOT PAY AS MUCH.

02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:42.206
FOR THE HOUSING THAT THEY HAVE

02:24:42.273 --> 02:24:45.476
AND THIS SHORTAGE HAS CREATED

02:24:45.543 --> 02:24:47.845
ALSO ARE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS

02:24:47.912 --> 02:24:49.013
SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.481
REASONABLE MEASURE BECAUSE IT

02:24:50.548 --> 02:24:52.784
ADDRESSES. THAT VERY

02:24:52.850 --> 02:24:55.553
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE OF ENABLING

02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.255
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO SO

02:24:57.321 --> 02:24:59.891
CHOOSE TO BE ABLE TO REZONE

02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:02.026
SOME OF THOSE PARCELS IF THEY

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:03.828
ARE IN THESE TYPES OF AREAS.

02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:11.102
NOW I AM. I WAS- IT'S HARD TO

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:13.037
HEAR ARE GOOD COLLEAGUES IN THE

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:16.274
BUILDING TRADES SO- UNANIMOUSLY

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:17.642
OPPOSE THE BILL MY

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:19.243
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS

02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:21.679
DISCUSSION AND THERE WERE SOME-

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:24.682
PROVISIONS THAT WOULD- HAVE

02:25:24.749 --> 02:25:26.317
THEM BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:28.352
BUT EVEN WITH THOSE PROVISIONS

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:31.889
THEY HAVE CHOSEN NOW TO OPPOSE

02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:33.324
AND I HOPETHAT WE CAN GET TO A

02:25:33.391 --> 02:25:35.293
GOOD MEETING OF THE MINDS

02:25:35.359 --> 02:25:36.594
HOWEVER I THINK THIS IS STILL A

02:25:36.661 --> 02:25:40.231
VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND I WILL

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:45.069
BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. CENTER

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:50.208
SENATOR WHICH'LL BOOK. THANK

02:25:50.274 --> 02:25:51.809
YOU MADAM CHAIR I DO HAVE A

02:25:51.876 --> 02:25:53.144
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE

02:25:53.211 --> 02:25:55.980
AUTHOR IF I MAY YEAH. I

02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:57.882
RECEIVED A LOT OF LETTERS OF

02:25:57.949 --> 02:25:59.917
CONCERN WITH THIS BILL FROM

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:02.787
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS- AND

02:26:02.854 --> 02:26:03.654
MOST OF WHAT I SEE THE

02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:06.090
UNDERLYING THEME IS THE FEAR OF

02:26:06.157 --> 02:26:08.192
THE- LOSING THE INTEGRITY OF

02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:10.027
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES SPECIALLY

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:12.864
RESIDENTIAL AREAS. WOULD YOU

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:14.832
CLARIFY I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

02:26:14.899 --> 02:26:16.334
WOULD ALLOW FIRST OF ALL I

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:17.135
WOULD RECOMMEND THE FACT THAT

02:26:17.201 --> 02:26:20.138
YOU ARE- AUTHORIZING NOT

02:26:20.204 --> 02:26:21.105
MANDATING OUR LOCAL

02:26:21.172 --> 02:26:23.241
JURISDICTIONS I THINK THAT IS

02:26:23.307 --> 02:26:23.841
THAT IS COMMENDABLE AND

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.510
RESPECTABLE. ON THE FIRST

02:26:25.576 --> 02:26:27.645
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE COMING FROM

02:26:27.712 --> 02:26:29.113
MY AREA I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:32.183
LACK OF HOUSING PERIOD IS HUGE.

02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:33.851
AND SO ON THAT END AND

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:34.852
APPRECIATE LOCAL CONTROL

02:26:34.919 --> 02:26:36.220

02:26:45.229 --> 02:26:46.063
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT

02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:48.566
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS URBAN

02:26:48.633 --> 02:26:51.936
AND WHAT IS- SUBURBAN AND RURAL

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:55.273

EVER RAISE YOUR FIVE. BUT IT'S

02:29:23.487 --> 02:29:25.489
BASICALLY THE U. S. CENSUS

02:29:25.556 --> 02:29:28.626
ACTUALLY DEFINES WHAT INFILL

02:29:28.693 --> 02:29:31.796
IS- IT'S A- IT'S CALLED

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:34.231
URBANIZED AREA OR AND URBAN

02:29:34.298 --> 02:29:36.500
CLUSTER SO HAS TO BE SORT OF

02:29:36.567 --> 02:29:38.436
CLUSTERED AGAIN NOT SORT OF

02:29:38.502 --> 02:29:41.539
SPREAD OUT- IN ADDITION SO IT'S

02:29:41.605 --> 02:29:42.973
ONE OF THE CLIMB BY THE CENSUS

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:44.475
AND OTHER ONE IS A SITE IN

02:29:44.542 --> 02:29:46.610
WHICH WILL BE 75% OF THE

02:29:46.677 --> 02:29:48.746
PERIMETER OF THE SITE THE JOINS

02:29:48.813 --> 02:29:51.282
OTHER PARCELS RIGHT SO IT'S NOT

02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:54.051
JUST LIKE BY ITSELF. HAS TO BE

02:29:54.118 --> 02:29:58.589
A LOT AROUND OTHER PARCELS- AND-

02:29:58.656 --> 02:30:01.492
A MATTER ALSO SO AS OWN PEROT.

02:30:01.559 --> 02:30:03.260
USE OR RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE

02:30:03.327 --> 02:30:05.196
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE GENERAL

02:30:05.262 --> 02:30:06.831
PLAN DESIGNATION THAT ALLOWS

02:30:06.897 --> 02:30:08.799
RESIDENTS FOR USE OR A MIX OF

02:30:08.866 --> 02:30:10.468
RESIDENTIAL. AND NON

02:30:10.534 --> 02:30:12.770
RESIDENTIAL OUR WORLD THESE TWO

02:30:12.837 --> 02:30:14.205
THIRDS OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE

02:30:14.271 --> 02:30:16.307
HAS TO BE FOR RESIDENTIAL. FOR

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.209
THEIR ALL AREAS WERE LIKE AN

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:20.878
AREA OF WORK WHERE WE ARE

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:23.114
BURGER COMMUNITIES HAVE PLANS.

02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:25.416
FOR HOUSING AND FOR THAT KIND

02:30:25.483 --> 02:30:29.687
OF CONTINUOUS. KIND OF HOUSING-

02:30:29.754 --> 02:30:31.021
SO THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT

02:30:31.088 --> 02:30:33.257
WAYS A COUNTY UNTIL- AND THAT

02:30:33.324 --> 02:30:34.892

THEIR LOCAL PLANNING AND

02:30:57.715 --> 02:31:00.785
ZONING. SO THE BILL A COUPLE

02:31:00.851 --> 02:31:01.852
THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN UNDER

02:31:01.919 --> 02:31:03.754
FIRST CITY COUNCIL HAS TO

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:05.389
DECIDE OFTEN. THAT THE CITY

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:07.591
COUNCIL DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE

02:31:07.658 --> 02:31:09.894

WHAT IT COULD BE A MINISTERIAL

02:31:28.879 --> 02:31:30.614
APPROVAL PROCESS. AND THEN ONCE

02:31:30.681 --> 02:31:32.383

THOSE PROJECTS WITH THIS BILL

02:31:47.298 --> 02:31:49.400
DOES NOT. CHANGE WHAT THE

02:31:49.467 --> 02:31:51.302
APPROVAL PROCESS WOULD BE

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:52.369
THAT'S WHATEVER THE CURRENT

02:31:52.436 --> 02:31:55.806
GOVERNING LAW AS- WHICH

02:31:55.873 --> 02:31:57.174
CLARIFIES WHETHER OR NOT.

02:31:57.241 --> 02:31:58.409
INDIVIDUALS OR COMMUNITY

02:31:58.476 --> 02:32:00.277
MEMBERS STILL HAVE A VOICE TO

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:01.679
COME IN AND GIVE THEIR VOICE TO

02:32:01.745 --> 02:32:03.747
THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RIGHT

02:32:18.128 --> 02:32:19.563
EACH INDIVIDUAL PROJECT.

02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:21.999
WHATEVER THE APPROVAL PROCESS

02:32:22.066 --> 02:32:23.868
IS NOT SOME CITIES HAVE. A

02:32:23.934 --> 02:32:25.135
MINISTERIAL STREAMLINED

02:32:25.202 --> 02:32:27.304
APPROVAL PROCESS AND NOT SIX

02:32:27.371 --> 02:32:30.007
DECISION THAT THE CITY HAS MADE

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:31.408
THERE ARE SOME STATE LAWS THAT.

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:33.944
CAN REQUIRE THAT BUT- WHATEVER

02:32:34.011 --> 02:32:35.713
YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE PROCESS

02:32:35.779 --> 02:32:37.314

TO PARTICIPATE FULLY I AM NOT

02:32:44.488 --> 02:32:46.290
PROCESS PERFECT SO THIS

02:32:46.357 --> 02:32:47.892
ACCOMMODATES THE FACT THAT

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:49.860
WE'RE NOT DOING A ONE SIZE FITS

02:32:49.927 --> 02:32:51.161
ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHERE

02:32:51.228 --> 02:32:52.396
IT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT EACH

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:55.132
INDIVIDUAL ENTITY. COMMUNITY IS

02:32:55.199 --> 02:32:57.535
UNIQUE. ABOUT THAT THAT'S

02:32:57.601 --> 02:32:59.203
CORRECT BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:00.104
CITY NOT ONLY DO CITIES GET TO

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:08.112
DAY. IF THEY OPT IN. VEGAS TO

02:33:08.178 --> 02:33:12.449
DECIDE. WHERE INNER CITY. BAKER

02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:13.884
SO THEY HAVE LOTS OF ENTIRE

02:33:13.951 --> 02:33:16.253
CITY IS CONSIDERED AN FELT.

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.922
BIGGER SAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO

02:33:17.988 --> 02:33:20.224
DO THIS ON THIS ONE STREET. OR

02:33:20.291 --> 02:33:22.393
ONE NEIGHBORHOOD. FOUR ONE HALF

02:33:22.459 --> 02:33:24.328
OF THE CITY OR THE WHOLE CITY

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:25.229
WHATEVER THE WHATEVER THEY

02:33:25.296 --> 02:33:28.933
DECIDED TO DO- NO ONE WOULD BE

02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:31.368
TELLING THEM. BUT HELL TO DO A

02:33:31.435 --> 02:33:32.169
CITY WOULD BE ABLE TO COME UP

02:33:32.236 --> 02:33:34.772
WITH ITS OWN VERSION OF IT THAT

02:33:34.838 --> 02:33:36.974
YOU NEED TO THAT. OUR CITY AND

02:33:37.041 --> 02:33:40.010
IN THE CITY- COULD DECIDE WE

02:33:40.077 --> 02:33:41.579
WANTED TO BE A STREAMLINED

02:33:41.645 --> 02:33:43.747
MINISTERIAL APPROVAL WE WANT TO

02:33:43.814 --> 02:33:45.516
BE DISCRETIONARY YOU KNOW

02:33:45.583 --> 02:33:47.484
UNLESS STATE LAW. DICTATES ONE

02:33:47.551 --> 02:33:49.787
OR THE OTHER- AND THEN SO I

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:51.522
THINK THIS WILL IT WOULD LOOK.

02:33:51.589 --> 02:33:53.123
PROBABLY FOR VERY DIFFERENT AND

02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:55.659
EVERY CITY THAT DID IT. BECAUSE

02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:56.260
DIFFERENT CITIES ARE GOING TO

02:33:56.327 --> 02:33:58.228
PICK AND CHOOSE. WHERE WHERE TO

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:02.566
DO IT. OKAY PERFECT AND THEN

02:34:02.633 --> 02:34:03.667
THE LAST- CONCERNED. THIS IS

02:34:03.734 --> 02:34:08.372
NOT OVER RIGHT ANY. ANY- ANY

02:34:08.439 --> 02:34:09.540
CODE THAT COMES FROM

02:34:09.607 --> 02:34:12.443
CONSTRUCTION CODE- GOVERNMENTAL

02:34:12.509 --> 02:34:18.749
CODE- LABOR CODES- ANY OF THAT

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:19.883
THE ONLY THING IS THAT THE

02:34:19.950 --> 02:34:21.819
MAKING A CHANGES IS A SAYS THAT

02:34:21.885 --> 02:34:23.053
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.089
C. QUITE YEAH I OUR STREAMS

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:26.857
LINES IT MAKES IT LESS COSTLY

02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:29.994
FOR THE ZONING- THAT DOTS THE

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:31.729
DOTS REALLY THE SIGNIFICANT

02:34:31.795 --> 02:34:35.132
CHANGE IN THE BILL- HI. IN

02:34:35.199 --> 02:34:37.835
TERMS OF LAWN LABOR NO IT

02:34:37.901 --> 02:34:40.838
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING- WITH

02:34:40.904 --> 02:34:41.772
LABOR AND I JUST WANNA

02:34:41.839 --> 02:34:44.241
KNOWLEDGE- YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:45.943
EXTENSIVELY WITH WITH THE BILL

02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:46.510
INSURANCE FOR MANY YEARS ON

02:34:46.577 --> 02:34:48.846
HOUSING AND HAVE PUT LABOR

02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:49.880
PROTECTIONS AND BILLS BEFORE

02:34:49.947 --> 02:34:51.782
AND I'VE HAD MAJOR HOUSING

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:54.284
BILLS THAT THE BUILDING TRADES

02:34:54.351 --> 02:34:58.155
HAVE. STRONG SUPPORTED- ON ON

02:34:58.222 --> 02:35:00.024
THIS BILL WE AS CENTER SKNNER

02:35:00.090 --> 02:35:01.659
MENTIONED WE DID WORK WITH THE

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:03.527
BUILDING TRADES LAST YEAR WE

02:35:03.594 --> 02:35:05.729
AGREED ON AMENDMENT THAT WOULD

02:35:05.796 --> 02:35:06.363
RESULT IN THEM BEING NEUTRAL IN

02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:09.066
THE BILL THAT ONE AND THAT

02:35:09.133 --> 02:35:10.067
EXACT LANGUAGE WENT INTO THE

02:35:10.134 --> 02:35:11.635
READ REINTRODUCTION OF THE BILL

02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:13.837
THIS YEAR SB TIME BECAUSE OF

02:35:13.904 --> 02:35:14.571
THE DIFFERENT VERSION LAST

02:35:14.638 --> 02:35:17.608
YEAR- AND- I JUST WANNA LET YOU

02:35:17.675 --> 02:35:20.144
LIVE OUT HOLDS I MEAN WE STILL

02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:21.945
HAVE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO.

02:35:22.012 --> 02:35:23.681
WORK IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT SO

02:35:23.747 --> 02:35:24.748
FAR THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

02:35:24.815 --> 02:35:26.817
IT THAT WAS L. STANDARD I MEAN

02:35:26.884 --> 02:35:28.652
THE WORKPLACE SAFETY

02:35:28.719 --> 02:35:30.487
PROTECTIONS ARE OFTEN A DOZEN

02:35:30.554 --> 02:35:33.023
CHANGES AT ALL THAT DOES IT YOU

02:35:33.090 --> 02:35:34.558
KNOW SOMETHING WE HAVE A-

02:35:34.625 --> 02:35:36.860
CONVERSATION ABOUT ABOUT WAGES

02:35:36.927 --> 02:35:39.263
AND I'M NOT AS CONCERNED WE

02:35:39.329 --> 02:35:40.397
WORKED WITH THE TRADE ON OVER

02:35:40.464 --> 02:35:42.199
THE YEARS- BUT THESE ARE

02:35:42.266 --> 02:35:43.300
BECAUSE THERE'S A SMALLER

02:35:43.367 --> 02:35:44.568
PROJECT WE TYPICALLY HAVE NOT

02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:46.203
PUT THOSE WAGE REQUIREMENTS

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:48.839
AND- FOR PROJECTS TEN UNDER. AT

02:35:48.906 --> 02:35:50.174
THAT IS THAT A LATER START

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.408
ANYWAY BUT I APPRECIATE THE

02:35:51.475 --> 02:35:53.577
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL I

02:35:53.644 --> 02:35:55.079
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

02:35:55.145 --> 02:35:56.380
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A

02:35:56.447 --> 02:35:57.781
PLACE BUT THAT'S NOT A

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:58.749
CONVERSATION FOR THIS TYPE OF

02:35:58.816 --> 02:36:00.884
BAIL- YOU KNOW THAT IS

02:36:00.951 --> 02:36:01.885
SOMETHING THAT IS COVERED AT A

02:36:01.952 --> 02:36:03.754
LATER TIME BUT- I DO APPRECIATE

02:36:03.821 --> 02:36:13.030
THAT- BUT THINK I THINK. IT I

02:36:13.097 --> 02:36:13.664
ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF

02:36:13.731 --> 02:36:14.765
THE AT WORK COMMENT ICON THREAD

02:36:14.832 --> 02:36:16.400
IN MOST OF THE- CAN THAT I HAD

02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:16.967
SAID YOU VERY. FOR YOUR FOR

02:36:17.034 --> 02:36:18.035
YOUR BILL AND BRING SPORT

02:36:18.102 --> 02:36:21.371
CENTER FOR YOUR- I DO HAVE A

02:36:21.438 --> 02:36:24.541
QUESTION A SENATOR WIENER- IT

02:36:24.608 --> 02:36:26.410
DOES SAY IN IN THE ACTUAL

02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:29.513
ANALYSIS HERE ON. OF THE NEW

02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:32.216
BILL THAT IT'S- TRANSIT RICH

02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:35.085
AREA JOBS RICH AREA OR ND

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:37.688
URBAN FIGHT AND URBAN INFILL

02:36:37.755 --> 02:36:39.957
SITE PROBABLY MAKES MORE SENSE

02:36:40.023 --> 02:36:41.792
BUT WHEN WE REACH OUT TO

02:36:41.859 --> 02:36:43.761
SUBURBIA. ESPECIALLY IN THE

02:36:43.827 --> 02:36:45.562
AREA THAT I LIVE THERE'S A

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:47.698
CONCERN THAT THIS BILL- IF YOU

02:36:47.765 --> 02:36:49.199
COMBINE IT WITH THE DENSITY

02:36:49.266 --> 02:36:51.435
BONUS- YOU'RE LOOKING OUT

02:36:51.502 --> 02:36:52.035
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

02:36:52.102 --> 02:36:54.204
DENSIFICATION IN A NUMBER OF

02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:56.173
RESIDENTIAL AREAS IF YOU HAVE

02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:58.008
AREAS WHERE THERE'S A VACANT

02:36:58.075 --> 02:37:00.410
LOTS AND WE DO HAVE THAT. IN A

02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:02.012
NUMBER OF MY COMMUNITY SO I

02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:04.081
GUESS MY QUESTION IS SIMPLY HOW

02:37:04.148 --> 02:37:05.716
IT IS THIS INTERFACE WITH THE

02:37:05.783 --> 02:37:07.551
DENSITY BONUS LAWS THAT HAVE

02:37:07.618 --> 02:37:10.354
BEEN PASSED SOME YARD IN THIS

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.221
SESSION AND SOME OF THE PAST

02:37:11.288 --> 02:37:13.123
SESSIONS IF THE DEVELOPER CAME

02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:15.392
IN AND WANTED TO DO. YOU KNOW

02:37:15.459 --> 02:37:17.094
THE TEN UNITS THROUGHOUT THE

02:37:17.161 --> 02:37:19.062
CITY TO AGREE TO THAT BUT ALSO

02:37:19.129 --> 02:37:21.231
WANTED TO APPLY DENSITY BONUS-

02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:23.267
YES AND YOU'RE RIGHT THE IN

02:37:23.333 --> 02:37:25.202
ADDITION TO AN INFILL IT'S- THE

02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:27.671
HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT AREA AND-

02:37:27.738 --> 02:37:30.674
JOB RICHER. FUNDS SO THE A

02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:32.442
DEVELOPER COULD BY DENSITY

02:37:32.509 --> 02:37:34.978
BONUS- TO THIS PRODUCT JUST

02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:37.681
LIKE ANY. MULTI UNIT PROJECT

02:37:37.748 --> 02:37:39.783
TYPICALLY SMALL MULTI UNIT

02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:41.685
DON'T NECESSARILY PENCIL WELL

02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:43.554
FOR DENSITY BONUS SO YOU HAVE

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:44.421
TO HAVE A CERTAIN SCALE

02:37:44.488 --> 02:37:47.191
TYPICALLY- SO YOU NORMALLY I

02:37:47.257 --> 02:37:48.058
DON'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD EVER

02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:50.093
SEE A DENSITY BONUS TRIGGERED

02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:51.595
ON A LIKE A FOUR OR FIVE UNIT

02:37:51.662 --> 02:37:53.797
BUILDING. MAYBE SOMEONE HAS

02:37:53.864 --> 02:37:54.431
DONE IT AT SOME POINT BUT

02:37:54.498 --> 02:37:56.667
THAT'S PRETTY RARE- BUT A CITY

02:37:56.733 --> 02:37:59.603
COULD- COULD AT LEAST IN PART

02:37:59.670 --> 02:38:00.704
COMPENSATE FOR THAT THIS

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:02.206
DOESN'T REQUIRE THE CITY TO GO

02:38:02.272 --> 02:38:05.375
UP TO TEN UNITS. RATED TEN TEN

02:38:05.442 --> 02:38:06.577
IS THE MAXIMUM THE CITY COULD

02:38:06.643 --> 02:38:08.145
YOU JUST BE TIME ZONE FOR FOUR

02:38:08.212 --> 02:38:09.780
UNITS ARE FIVE UNITS ARE THREE

02:38:09.847 --> 02:38:11.782
UNITS OR SEVEN OR TEN OR

02:38:11.849 --> 02:38:13.784
WHATEVER THEY WANT. SO IF A

02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:15.018
CITY IS CONCERNED OVER GOING TO

02:38:15.085 --> 02:38:17.087
OVERTIME AND THEN THE DENSITY

02:38:17.154 --> 02:38:19.256
BONUS COULD TAKE YOU UP TO

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:20.891
THIRTEEN UNITS OR SOMETHING THE

02:38:20.958 --> 02:38:22.960
CITY BANK RECAP AT SIX OR SEVEN

02:38:23.026 --> 02:38:24.695
TO COMPETENT TO THE CITY WOULD.

02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:26.797
WE TRY TO PROVIDE FEXIBILITY

02:38:26.864 --> 02:38:28.765
FOR THE CITY'S TO ENVISION WHAT

02:38:28.832 --> 02:38:35.505
THIS WILL ULTIMATELY. LOOK LIKE

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:36.106
A MAN AND AGAIN THE WHOLE ALL

02:38:36.173 --> 02:38:37.140
HERE. IS TO MAKE CITY LIVES

02:38:37.207 --> 02:38:38.709
EASIER. SO THEY CAN CHIU- THEIR

02:38:38.775 --> 02:38:39.643
OWN DESK IN THIS. WHEN FORCE

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:40.944
THEM TO DO IT. BUT I THINK

02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:43.113
THAT'S OF SIMPLY. GOOD

02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:45.349
COMPONENT OF THIS BUT I DO.

02:38:45.415 --> 02:38:47.885
RAISE MY USUAL CONCERN IS WHEN

02:38:47.951 --> 02:38:49.720
YOU START DOING GASIFICATION.

02:38:49.786 --> 02:38:51.488
AND YOU TAKE AWAY- HIS

02:38:51.555 --> 02:38:52.990
SPECIALLY IN THE AREAS LET'S

02:38:53.056 --> 02:38:54.691
SAY THEY'RE TRANSIT RICH. UP

02:38:54.758 --> 02:38:57.527
IRVINE IS A GREAT. EXAMPLE OF

02:38:57.594 --> 02:38:59.663
TRANSIT RICH IS A JOBCENTRE BUT

02:38:59.730 --> 02:39:01.832
IS VERY RESIDENTIAL AND YOU

02:39:01.899 --> 02:39:03.667
WOULD BE ELIMINATING-

02:39:03.734 --> 02:39:06.036
REQUIREMENT FOR PARKING. AND

02:39:06.103 --> 02:39:07.437
I'D LIKE TO TRAVEL FROM OF

02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:08.672
THOSE AREAS AND SEE WHAT THAT

02:39:08.739 --> 02:39:10.574
HAS DONE ALL THE PARKING OF ALL

02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:13.310
OVER THE STREETS. AND WHEN YOU

02:39:13.377 --> 02:39:14.611
HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:16.847
ESPECIALLY IN UNIVERSITY TOWNS

02:39:16.914 --> 02:39:19.316
LEVINE AGAIN. OF THE DAY ARE

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:21.184
DOUBLING UP IN THESE UNITS

02:39:21.251 --> 02:39:22.352
BECAUSE IT'S VERY AFFORDABLE

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.755
BUT THEY ALL HAVE CARS. YOU

02:39:24.821 --> 02:39:26.556
FIVE HARDLY FIND OF KIDS IN

02:39:26.623 --> 02:39:28.792
THAT AREA- THAT AGE THAT DON'T

02:39:28.859 --> 02:39:31.762
BECAUSE- YOU NEED THEM. SO THAT

02:39:31.828 --> 02:39:33.597
REMAINS MY MAJOR CONCERN WITH

02:39:33.664 --> 02:39:35.766
THE DENSIFICATION ALL THAT IS

02:39:35.832 --> 02:39:37.200
TAKEN PLACE AND YOU KNOW OUR

02:39:37.267 --> 02:39:39.369
HOUSING- THEORY HERE AND WE

02:39:39.436 --> 02:39:40.637
REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:39:40.704 --> 02:39:42.005
IT AND I THINK YOU HEARD ME

02:39:42.072 --> 02:39:43.473
MANY TIMES I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:45.075
IT. BECAUSE IN MY CITY WE'VE

02:39:45.142 --> 02:39:46.643
LOST LIVES OF CHILLED CHILDREN

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:48.245
OF HAVE. LOST THEIR LIVES

02:39:48.312 --> 02:39:51.014
GOING. IN THESE AREAS WHERE IF.

02:39:51.081 --> 02:39:53.216
YOU KNOW CONDOMINIUMS- AND SOME

02:39:53.283 --> 02:39:55.619
APARTMENTAREAS GOING THROUGH-

02:39:55.686 --> 02:39:57.621
YOU KNOW PARK CARS HERE AND

02:39:57.688 --> 02:39:58.588
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE AND THEY

02:39:58.655 --> 02:40:00.324
HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES SO. I'M

02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.659
GONNA STICK WITH THAT BUT I DO-

02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:04.594
SAY THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT.

02:40:04.661 --> 02:40:06.930
VOLUNTARY BECAUSE I THINK OUR

02:40:06.997 --> 02:40:08.131
CITY COUNCILS ON THE BIG

02:40:08.198 --> 02:40:09.466
ADVOCATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:11.201
AND I THINK THEY DO A GOOD JOB.

02:40:11.268 --> 02:40:12.602
IN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT IS

02:40:12.669 --> 02:40:14.438
GOING TO BE. IN A RIGHT FOR

02:40:14.504 --> 02:40:16.440
THEIR COMMUNITIES FEIST RIGHT

02:40:16.506 --> 02:40:18.408
AND CERTAINLY LOCATION RIGHT.

02:40:18.475 --> 02:40:20.410
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF AREA AND

02:40:20.477 --> 02:40:21.378
HERE THAT- THE AUDIENCE

02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:23.313
DISCRETIONARY ONCE YOU SAY

02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.414
YOU'RE GOING TO DO A DENSITY

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:25.949
BONUS AND WE'RE REQUIRED TO YOU

02:40:26.016 --> 02:40:27.384
COULD HAVE A TEN UNIT THING AND

02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:34.558
NOW. THEY WANT TO PUT FOR UNITS.

02:40:34.624 --> 02:40:35.192
IN ADDITION THAT ARE AFFORDABLE

02:40:35.258 --> 02:40:35.792
AND ANY MEDIA REALLY OPENS UP

02:40:35.859 --> 02:40:37.194
THE TO DO. BY AND ALL THE OTHER

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:38.362
SO I WILL BE A- TO THE BUT I

02:40:38.428 --> 02:40:39.329
KNOW THAT YOU. VERY HARD ON THE
