OKAY NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM THE FIRST AUTHOR- WE WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS YOU MAY NOW PRESENT AB. THREE ZERO ZERO FIVE. THANK YOU US CENTER MINING AND COLLEAGUES CHAIRMAN STEARNS GREAT TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK SENATOR STERN AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR- THE CONSIDERATION AND ENGAGEMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL. IT'S AN INFORMAL FAR DISTRICT AND- I KNOW THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK WITH OUR- THE COMPRESSED- LEGISLATIVE TIMELINE THIS IS A ABOUT A BILL THAT HAS IT WAS A HUGE UNDERTAKING SO I'M- VERY THANKFUL. AND WITH THAT I'M PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ZERO ZERO FIVE THE EXPEDITED DAM SAFETY FOR SILICON VALLEY ACT. LOOKS TO RESOLVE A MAJOR ISSUE IN OUR DISTRICT- AN ISSUE. THAT HAS REGIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY AND WATER SUPPLY IMPACTS AND REQUIRES IMMEDIATE STATE ACTION. THIS LEGISLATION SEEKS TO ENACT pTHAT ARE NEEDED THIS YEAR TO EXPEDITE NECESSARY SEISMIC RETROFITS. FOR THE LEROY ANDERSON DAMMIT BY THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT AND IT ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY DOING THE FOLLOWING FIRST CARE I'M OF THE BILL. THANK SEVEN NOTED PLEASE CONTINUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FIRST THIS LEGISLATION SEEKS TO EXPEDITE PERMITTING AND EXPRESS PERMITTING BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WITH ALL ASSOCIATED COSTS THAT WILL BE COVERED BY VALLEY WATER- I LIKE TO NOTE THAT BOTH AGENCIES HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH OUR OFFICE ON THESE MEASURES. SECONDED THE COMMITTEES- I WITH WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THIS LEGISLATION WILL AUTHORIZE BEST VALUE CONTRACTING AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR SEQUEL OF CLAIMS- THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW WAS MADE POSSIBLE WITH COMMITMENTS FROM THE WATER DISTRICT VALLEY WATER. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AND SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCESSIONS AND THE BENEFITS INCLUDING REQUIRING THE PROJECT TO DELIVER NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AS I MENTIONED THIS IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE WITH REGIONAL IMPACTS THIS DAM WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY AND WHEN IT WAS BUILT IT WAS BUILT TO THE SAFETY STANDARDS OF THAT TIME- BUT AS WE KNOW THE DAM WAS CONSTRUCTED ALONG TO EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES THE CALAVERAS. A FAULT WHICH IS A MAJOR BRANCH OF THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT SYSTEM. AND THE DAM ALSO SITS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE CAIRO CREEK FAULTLINE- AND TODAY THE STATE HAS SOME SERIOUS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ISSUES- IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE A BREACH OF THE DAM AT FULL CAPACITY WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT WHILE VALLEY WATER CAN DRAIN THE DAM- COMMITTEE V. EIGHT A MAJOR RAIN EVENT THE WATERSHED CAN REFILL THE MUCH FASTER THAN IT CAN BE DRAINED. AND SO IF A BREACH OF THE WERE TO OCCUR IT'S PREDICTED THAT FROM THE SIDE OF THE DAM FLOODING WOULD EXTEND MORE THAN FORTY MILES. FLOODING OVER A HALF DOZEN CITIES AND TOWNS AND SUBMERGING MUCH OF THE SILICON VALLEY. MOST LIKELY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AT A MINIMUM WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EVACUATE. RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF PROPERTY AND POTENTIALLY LIFE. AND SO THIS BILL IS AN URGENCY BILL CONTAINS AN URGENCY CLAUSE. BECAUSE ON FEBRUARY TWENTIETH THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION FOR. ISSUED A DAM SAFETY DIRECTIVE- A DIRECTIVE REQUIRING THE VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. TO FULLY DRAW DOWN THIS STARTING OCTOBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL ORDER THIS. RETROFIT IS FOR EX NUMBER ONE HIGHEST DAM SAFETY PRIORITY PROJECT IN THE NATION. A BECAUSE BASED ON NEW INFORMATION REGARDING THE DAM TO SEISMIC VULNERABILITIES THE DAM SAFETY RISK IS ON ACCEPTABLY HIGH. AND THIS FEDERAL DIRECTIVE- TO BEGIN TRADING THE LARGEST RESERVOIR IN THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA POSES MANY MANY CHALLENGES- THE DRAINAGE WILL SEVERELY REDUCE WATER RESERVES GROUNDWATER BASINS COULD BE IMPACTED IN THE COUNTY. AND FOR A STATE THAT'S PRO TO DROUGHT THIS IS A HUGE HUGE PROBLEM. AND SO AGAIN THIS URGENCY LEGISLATION SEEKS TO EXPEDITE PERMITTING CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS. IT WOULD ALSO CREATE OVER FIVE THOUSAND GOOD PAYING JOBS AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED THE MOST. THAT'S A WITH ME THIS MORNING TO TESTIFY IS THE CITY OF MORGAN HILLS MAYOR RICH CONSTANTIJN. AND ALSO VALLEY WATERS DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS BARTRAM REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND JUST BEFORE WE GO TO THOSE WITNESSES. I DO WANT TO SEE IF SENATOR STERN WHO WORKED WITH YOU ON THE AMENDMENTS HAD A COMMENT THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE BEFORE WE GO TO- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. SENATOR STERN DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS LEGISLATION. SURE JUST BRIEFLY THANK YOU. CENTER MONNING AND TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR. BEING SENT TO A STEADY STEWARD OF THIS BILL AND GETTING IT THIS FAR IN A TOUGH CLIMATE. IT SAYS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT- MORGAN HILL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FLOOD MAPPING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IT'S LIKE THE ENTIRE REGION ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE COOKED IN THE INLAND COAST REGION- YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO LAND AND- COMPLEX PROBLEM HERE WE'RE YOU'RE MITIGATING ONE MASSIVE CLIMATE RISK WHICH IS OF FLOODING AND INUNDATION BUT INTO ANOTHER IN THE PROCESS WHICH IS LOW WATER SUPPLIES DURING POTENTIAL DROUGHT SO SPEED IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HERE BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR THIS. RECOGNIZE THAT- WE HAVE TO GO FAST BUT WE STILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE DOWNSTREAM ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION NEEDS THAT WERE SETTLED A WHILE AGO AND THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN REALLY IN PARALLEL I THINK WE LANDED IN A REALLY GOOD COMPROMISE HERE AND I APPRECIATE- NOT JUST TO THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY- AUTHORITY BUT BUT ALSO OUR OUR% ENVIRONMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS WITH CAL TROUT AND SOME OF THE DOWNSTREAM ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE GET MITIGATION GOING- MOST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY THAT- WITHOUT FEDERAL ACTION WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO TO WORK AT TO GET AM AND LOFGREN AND ROLE T. YOU KNOW WE'RE LUCKY TO SOME INNER AGENCY MOVEMENT FEDERAL SO I THINK THIS IS FOR. COP AND I YOU WITH IS MEMBER AND AT BEFORE THIS THING GETS TO THE FOR I THINK ALL THE WOMEN OF THE G. THERE ARE OUT ME AND NOW. SHOULD BE. IN A- TEXT FORM SO I'M I THINK COMMITTEE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE GOT A GRANY. TEXTURE FOR US. AND DURABLE DEAL AND THAT I'LL I'LL SEE DO THIS BY IN THE F THE TESTAMENT ROBERT. HAGER OKAY THANK YOU SENT STERN WE'RE GONNA TAKE A QUICK. WE'RE GOING TO DO THE REACH. ON OUR QUORUM- I WAS INFORMED WE COULD NOT USE THE REMOTE MEMBER TO ESTABLISH OUR QUORUM SAYING ASK OUR CONSULTANT TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGAIN TO ESTABLISH QUORUM. MORNING HERE ON IN HERE JONES- JONES HERE ALLEN. ALLEN HERE BURGESS. URGES HERE CABALLERO CABALLERO HERE HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON YES JACKSON HERE. THANK YOU IS QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED AND NOW WE WILL GO TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT LET ME JUST AGAIN REMIND PEOPLE THE GROUND RULES WE WILL ALLOW FOR MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO DIVIDE HOWEVER THEY CHOOSE AND FOUR MINUTES FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WITH THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AFTER THE PRIMARY TESTIMONY WE WILL GO TO- OTHERS WHO'LL ADD ON WITH NAME AFFILIATION AND VOICING THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SUPPORT SIDE IN THEIR OPPOSITION FOR THE OPPOSITION SIDE. MODERATOR CAN YOU BRING IN MAYOR RICH CONSTANTIJN MAYOR CITY OF MORGAN HILL. TRANSLOCATED DIRECTLY BELOW ANDERSON DAM RESERVOIR IF THE DAM FAILS WHEN IT'S AT FULL CAPACITY A THIRTY FOOT WALL OF WATER WOULD SWEEP THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY IN FIVE TO FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE DEVASTATION THAT WOULD RUN NORTH THROUGH SILICON VALLEY AND SOUTH TO MONTEREY BAY. THE EARTHQUAKE FAULTS ONE LOCATED ABOUT A MILE AWAY FROM THE DAM AND THE OTHER DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE DAM ARE NOT DORMANT WE HAD A FOUR POINT OH EARTHQUAKE EARLIER THIS YEAR. IMAGINE WONDERING EVERY TIME THE SHAKES IF A THIRTY FOOT WALL OF WATER IS HEADED YOUR WAY I CAN TELL YOU THAT GETTING THIS M. REMOVED AND REPLACED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IS A BIT HIGH FOR EVERYBODY WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT STICK. THAT'S WHY THE CITY OF MORGAN HILL STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. IN A TO PROTECT LIVES PROPERTY. A REBUILT DOWN OR STORE PRECIOUS WATER SUPPLIES TO NOT JUST MIGHT CITY. BUT ALMOST A DOZEN OTHERS THROUGHOUT SILICON VALLEY. THE DAM PROVIDES FLOOD PROTECTION AND WATER FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WHICH SUPPLIES SHALL COUNTY AGRICULTURE AND PREVENT SUBSIDENCE AND ALL THE PROBLEMS IT BRINGS. BOTTOM LINE IS WHY WE NEED A NEW DAM IS THAT IT'S EXPECTED POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHY IN I WAS IN WASHINGTON DC THIS PAST DECEMBER MEETING WITH CONGRESSWOMAN THE AWKWARD AND THE OTHER THREE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO REPRESENT OUR COUNTY WHO ARE ALL WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE FEDERAL REGULATIONS DON'T TIE THIS PROJECT UP.

I'M A PROUD CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK- THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE SENATOR STERN IN HIS. STAFF ANA LEAD CONSULTANT. FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO REACH. I THINK A VERY STRONG RESOLUTION WITH WITH ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS BY THE AUTHOR. WE'VE HEARD FROM SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS LET ME JUST COMMENT ON THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE HANDER SIR DAN ANDERSON DAM- TO HUMANS AND TO HABITAT. WE SUFFERED A TRAGIC- OVERFLOWED DURING THE FLOODS STORMS THAT TOOK OUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PROPERTY DOWN CREATIVITY CREEK IN SAN SAYING. IT MADE A LOT OF RESIDENTS HOMELESS. IT LED TO- A MERCHANT SEE RESPONSE. DURING THE FLOODING OF THE REGION. THE DAM STILL SERVED A PURPOSE DESPITE ITS OVERFLOW THAT. THAT TRAGEDY WASN'T AND AS WE'VE HEARD FROM WITNESSES THE SEISMIC SAFETY ISSUES THAT HAVE LED TO BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL INTERVENTION- RECOGNIZE THAT THE SEISMIC RISK POSED TO RESIDENTS OF MORGAN HILL IN DOWN STREAM DOWN THE CODY CREEK- THIS POSES A SIGNIFICANT IMMEDIATE URGENT. PUBLIC SAFETY RISK AND PARTIES HAVE PULLED TOGETHER THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR YEARS- IN TRYING TO COORDINATE AMONG DIFFERENT FEDERAL AGENCIES DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES CHARGE WITH WILDLIFE AND FISHERY PROTECTION CHARGED WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND DAM SAFETY. AND I JUST WANT TO APPLY TO ALL THE PARTIES THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER TO TRY TO MOVE THIS CRITCAL PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE FORWARD I THINK THERE'S BEEN CONCERN RANGED ABOUT THE USE OF EXPEDITED REVIEW I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL. IT EXEMPTS THE SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS THERE ARE NO SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS THERE IS EXPEDITED REVIEW BUT THERE WILL STILL BE SEQUEL REVIEW AND COMPLIANCE- REQUIRED COMPLIANCE AS THE PROJECT MOVES FORWARD- THIS IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. NOT ONLY TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE DISTRICT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND I REPRESENT THAT NAME DURING DISTRICTS REPRESENTED BY SENATOR CABALLERO REPRESENTED- TO THE NORTH IN SAN JOSE SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WANT O THANK ALL THOSE WHO HAVE PULLED TOGETHER SPECIAL THANKS TO CONGRESSWOMAN SO LOFGREN WHO'S MADE THIS A PRIORITY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS WELL. IN WITH THOSE COMMENTS I WILL. TURN THE OTHER MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. PLEASE AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL FROM VICE CHAIR JONES AND I RECOGNIZE SENATOR JACKSON. S. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF THIS- AND SO I'M I'M KIND OF TORN. BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY OF COURSE IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MY CONCERN AGAIN IS- AS WE REQUIRE THE COURTS ARE TO DO EXPEDITED REVIEW THERE ARE THERE ARE FEW PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ONE IS I DON'T THINK WE REALLY CAN FORCE THEM TO DO A REVIEW IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS- IT'S KIND OF ASPIRATIONAL ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE CONTROL OVER THE COURTS AND THE PROCEDURAL- MANNER WITH WHICH THEY- OPERATE. THIS A ARE NOW WITH IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC- WE ARE FIGHTING TO RETAIN THE ABEYANCE ON FICTIONS OUR CRIMINAL COURTS ARE BACKLOGGED BECAUSE OF THE- MONTHS WHERE WE HAVE ALSO WITHHELD THE PROCESS BY WHICH- OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCEEDS AND OF COURSE THAT THE LAW THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS FOR SPEEDY TRIALS- WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WORKING WITH PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO KEEP. THE COURTS FUNCTIONING EVEN THOUGH THE REALLY NOT FUNCTIONING AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS- EXPEDITED REVIEW. SO THE IN THE IN ITS CURRENT CONTEXT I'M CONCERNED IN THAT REGARD ALSO THE MORE EXPEDITED REVIEWS THAT WE DIRECT FOR THESE VARIOUS KINDS OF PROJECTS THE QUESTION THAT COMES TO ME IS. WHAT WHAT'S THE NEXT URGENCY THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE CARE BECAUSE OUR- INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN DISREPAIR AND- IT'S DANGEROUS AND SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS SO I AM TORN BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE- THIS LEVEL OF POTENTIAL DISASTER. WHICH APPARENTLY DOES EXIST ON THE OTHER HAND I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT. NGUYEN IS AN URGENT PROJECT ENERGY PROJECT I MAYBE IT'S THE PROVERBIAL CAMEL'S NOSE UNDER THE TENT- SO I I'M GONNA STAY OFF THE BILL- I DO. NOT SUPPORT THE EFFORT IT IS A CONCERN I SIT ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ARCHERS SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I IT'S PART MY JOB TO TRY TO DO WHAT I CAN TERMS A POLICY TO KEEP THE PROCESS AS- REALIST S. AS PART. IF THE WERE MORE YOU'RE COULD SET UP A SEEK TYPE EXPERT. TYPE PRICE. WHICH WAS FUNDED- I KNOW THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THERE CAN BE EXPEDITED ROUTE OF REVIEW- IF THEY'RE IN THERE ARE PROCEDURES NOW IN PLACE- BUT I JUST WORRY THAT IT COULD WITH ALL THE POTENTIAL EXPEDITED REVIEWS WE'RE GOING TO SEE. THE COURTS MAY VERY WELL JUST IGNORE THEM THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO DO BUT WHEN WERE NOW A SITUATION WHERE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES ONCE THE PROVERBIAL DAMAGE BROKEN IN TERMS OF. THE COURTS HAVING BILL AND DO THE WORK THAT WE EXPECT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE PRIORITIES WE GIVE TO CASES INVOLVING IN THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM PEOPLE WHO ARE SIXTY FIVE YEARS. AND OLDER THE PRIORITIES WE GIVE PEOPLE INSERT. OF K. SALAS IT SO THAT'S MY DILEMMA IF THE WERE MORE. PERHAPS I DON'T OPPOSE THE EFFORT I APPRECIATE YOUR DOING THIS I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. THAT ONE ELEMENT IS JUST OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME AND I REALLY FEEL THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER LOOK AT THIS AND IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF DEMANDS ON THE COURTS ARE GOING TO. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SCENE NINE WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JONES AND I TURN TO AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE S.

THIS BILL DOUBLES THE CURRENT BASELINE PENALTIES BRINGING THEM IN LINE WITH INFLATION AND ALSO ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER GALLON PENALTY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT.

THANK YOU MODERATOR WE WILL NOW TURN TO LEAD OPPOSITION ON AB THIRTY TWO FOURTEEN I BELIEVE WE HAVE JOHN BURKE WITH PACIFIC PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION AND SHAUN ONE TIME CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION FOUR MINUTES TO BE SHARED BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. MODERATOR PLEASE SPRING IN- MR BURKE THANK YOU. AND BERGER LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M JOHN BERG VICE PRESIDENT WITH THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT NON TANK VESSELS SERVICING CALIFORNIA SPORTS LIKE TO START BY SAYING WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. THE DOUBLING OF THE COBRA REQUIREMENTS AND A REDUCTION IN THE PER GALLON. PENALTY HOWEVER WE MUST RESPECTFULLY CONTINUE OPPOSITION THE BILL. FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. FIRST THE DOUBLING OF EXISTING PENALTY PROVISIONS. WE DO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO UPDATE FINES AND PENALTIES OVER TIME BUT THE SENATE SIMPLE DOUBLING SEEMS ARBITRARY AND UNSUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE. THIS SEEMS ESPECIALLY TRUE REGARDING THE DOUBLING OF THE PENALTY MINIMUM. WHICH WILL LIKELY BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF ANYTHING WE BELIEVE THE PENALTY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER MOMS LEAVING THAT TO THE DISCRETION OF PROSECUTORS AND THE COURTS TO DETERMINE. SECONDLY THE AMENDED THOUSAND DOLLAR PER GALLON PENALTY IS STILL FAR BEYOND ANY EXISTING PENALTIES THROUGHOUT STATE CODES WHICH ARE IN THE TEN TO SIXTY DOLLAR PER GALLON RANGE. THIS EXCESSIVE PENALTY WOULD APPLY PER NOWINGLY COSTS BILLS WHICH- UNDER WHICH SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE ACTUALLY QUALIFIES AND THAT'S THIS COULD APPLY TO PURELY ACCIDENTAL SPILLS WOULD DROP REGARD TO FALL BEFORE CULPABILITY. NOW THE AUTHORS STATED THE AMENDMENT PROVIDES A COURT FLEXIBILITY OUR IT DOES PROVIDE NO GUIDANCE AS TO HOW OR WHEN THIS HIGHER PENALTY SHOULD BE IMPOSED OR WHAT FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. WE THEREFORE REQUESTED A FURTHER GUIDANCE LANGUAGE FOR THIS PENALTY BE ADDED. TO INCLUDE KNOWINGLY WILFULLY OR RECKLESSLY AND THE CAUSATION OF THIS BILL. THAT'S WHAT APPROPRIATE FOLKS APPROPRIATELY FOCUS A PENALTY ON THE MORE GREGIS SPELLS AND POLLUTERS. WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OFFICER'S OFFICE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE HOPE THESE CAN BE RESOLVED HOWEVER UNTIL THEN WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW ABOUT ONE MINUTE FORTY FIVE SECONDS REMAINING FOR MR ONE TIME. SHARE NUMBERS- JOHN ONE TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION UP IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE BELIEVE- THE PENALTY THE CURRENT LAW ARE AN ADEQUATE DETERRENT. OIL PRODUCERS ARE HIGHLY INCENTIVIZED TO TAKE GREAT CARE TO ENSURE A SAFE PRODUCTION PROCESS. I D. W. EXISTING PENALTIES- IS MUCH HIGHER THAN INFLATION ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT ADJUSTING CURRENT PENALTY TO INFLATION SINCE THEY WERE LAST ADJUSTED WOULD EQUAL AN INCREASE ABOUT 49% NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- WHILE WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR REDUCING THE NEW PENALTY IN THE BILL OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER GALLON OF CRUDE OIL SPILL TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER GALLON HOWEVER- ALONG WITH DOUBLING OF THE OTHER FIND IN THE BILL THIS NEW PENALTY REMAINS EXCESSIVE IN OUR OPINION. BUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON AB THIRTY TWO FOURTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERYMUCH WE WILL NOW MOVE TO. SEE IF THERE'S OTHER OPPOSITION FIRST HEARING ROOM FORTY TWO ZERO THREE. SEEING NONE MOVING TO ROOM.

ONE ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE CHAMBER MEMBER GARCIA ONCE AGAIN FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN Q. THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I HAVE SENATOR JACKSON YOU RECOGNIZED YES THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS PREVENTED CURRENT IN OUR DISTRICT. ON MY BIRTHDAY SO I REMEMBER QUITE WELL- AND AS WE DUG DEEPER INTO WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS- THE FACT IS THAT PLAINS ALL AMERICAN PIPELINE HAD A CHOICE TO PUT IN A CUT OFF VALVE WOULD HAVE COST ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS- IN THAT YEAR THEY HAD MADE I THINK PROFITS OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO THEY MADE A BUSINESS DECISION TO USE AN OLD. INADEQUATE CUT OFF FAILED THAT WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE WHEN THE PRESSURE HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT IT HAD. AND WOULD HAVE CUT OFF OF THAT OIL. SO INSTEAD WHAT HAPPENED WAS IT WAS A WRITER ON MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND UP NEAR SOME OF OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE BEACHES AND OTHER FACILITIES. SO PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE STATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN. THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHO HAD PLANNED PROBABLY CLOSE TO A YEAR IN ADVANCE THAT'S WHEN RESERVATIONS HAD TO BE MADE AT THE STATE PARKS AND ALL TO COME UP TO SPEND THAT TIME WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THE PARKS WERE CLOSED. SO THIS NOT ONLY IMPACTED PEOPLE COMING TO WRECK CREATE IN THE AREA BUT ALSO THE BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES SO pKEEP EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERN FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES FOR A PERIOD OF SEVERAL WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION AND SO THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS. SO THIS ONE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT ENDED UP COSTING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND ALSO THE CLEANUP COSTS. AND THEN THERE WAS A PROSECUTION OR PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN WHICH THEY WERE FAR THE COMPANY WAS FOUND LIABLE NOW UNFORTUNATELY. YOU CAN'T PUT A CORPORATION IN JAIL. SO WHAT YOU CAN DO THOUGH IS THAT YOU CAN IMPOSE PENALTIES AND THE PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. THE JUDGE VERY SPECIFICALLY GBOMO ON THE FACT THAT THE AMOUNT OF PENALTY HE WAS ABLE TO INFLICT WAS SO MINIMAL BECAUSE THE- THE CURRENT STATE OF A MAXIMUM PENALTIES WAS SO LOW AND I SUSPECT THAT'S THE REASON THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL. AND SO IF WE'RE LOOKING TO TRY TO DETER THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THE FUTURE WHICH COST A NUMBER OF OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES TO GO UNDER. AND POLLUTED ARE- OCEANS. POLLUTED TO OR AND RUINED THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE STATE TO COME AND ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL COAST THAT BELONGS TO US ALL IN CALIFORNIA. THE AT THE ATTEMPT HERE TO A DOUBLE THE FINES IS REALLY. FRANKLY KIND OF MINIMAL- THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE OPPOSITION- IS ALSO. NOT SURPRISING BUT DISAPPOINTING WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO DISCOURAGE THIS BEHAVIOR GOING FORWARD SO. I THINK THE I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO PUT THAT IN THAT CONTEXT BECAUSE IT WAS THE JUDGE WHO AGAIN WAS UNABLE TO DO MORE EVEN AFTER A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. OF THIS COMPANY A TOOK PLACE SO- WITH THE ACT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL- FANTA AS CERTAINLY. RESHAPED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF IT AND WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON WHO'S MADE A MOTION. IN SUPPORT. OF AB THIRTY TWO FOURTEEN. SKEWS ME WHEN I TRIED IT DE ACTIVATED TIMER. MY APOLOGIES AND WE'LL TAKE IT BACK TO THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THAT THIS IS A ABOUT DETERRENCE AND THIS IS ABOUT DETERRENCE THAT WORK FOR EVERY COUNTY'S DISTRICT ATTORNEY- AS WELL AS THE COURTS- I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS HAS NOT THIS ISSUE HAD NOT COME UP. IN TEN YEARS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO EVERY SINGLE OIL SPILL THIS HAS HAPPENED ONCE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT- OF A VERY VERY VERY SMALL NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THEY CAN THIS CAN EVEN BE USED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT THIS TO BE A DETERRENT- I ALSO WANT TO IT BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS WITH THE OPPOSITION. ALSO SEE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE U. S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS CONSUMER PRICE INDEX CALCULATOR FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A NINETEEN NINETIES APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY. SO WE STILL THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SUCH A LARGE INCREASE- IT HAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS SINCE THESE HAVE BEEN UPDATED AND SO WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT AS WELL THE BILL HAS COME A LONG WAY WE'VE IMMENSELY I'M TO THE BILL BUT WE ABSOLUTELY FEEL THAT IT IN. TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A DETERRENT IT'S ONLY HAPPENED ONCE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS I'M BORED IT DOESN'T APPLY TO EVERY SINGLE OIL SPILL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ACOSTA. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN FOR THE RECORD YOU DID X. THE CAN MEMON SAID THE BIG OF YOUR PRESENTATION THIS TO PASS S. AND IT. PATIENTS. CAN WITH HIS CAR ON THE ROAD.

THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A SIXTH MASS EXTINCTION EVENT THAT LIKE CLIMATE CHANGES HUMAN BECAUSE- OF THREATENS HUMANITY'S SURVIVAL. IN THE STATE WE DO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AND THIS BILL IS SCIENCE DRIVEN. PRESERVING 30% IS NEEDED TO HELP HOLD AND HOPEFULLY REVERSE THIS CRISIS. SB THIRTY THIRTY ALSO ESTABLISHES A STATE POLICY TO IMPROVE BUT COULD WILL PUBLIC ACCESS WITH THE PACIFIC AND EMPHASIS ON CREATING ACCESS FOR STARK MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES.

MORE CHRONIC I WILL BE THE FIRST SPEAKER OKAY THANK YOU SO WE HAVE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE IF WE CAN HAVE THE MICROPHONE PLEASE THIS IS MR GRONIK WITH THE COASTAL CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK CARRILLO LOOK. I'M SPEAKING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SUSTAINABLY MANAGED. RECREATIONAL FISHING HUNTING AND COMMERCIAL FISHING COMMUNITIES. I CHAIR THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. THE FEDERAL BODY THAT MANAGES MOST FISHERIES OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. AND DESIGNATES AREAS PROTECTION BUT I'M HERE TODAY. AS A CALIFORNIA FISHERMEN. NO ONE DISPUTES THE NEED FOR GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER IN THIS AREA WITH BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION EXCEEDING THE 30% GOAL IN THIS BILL. PARTICULARLY IN MARINE WATERS WE CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT EXISTING ACCESS FOR A WIDE WIDE ARRAY OF RECREATIONAL PURSUITS. OR FOR COMMERCIAL FISHING ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE ELIMINATED UNLESS THOSE ACTIVITIES PRESENT HARM TO BIODIVERSITY THAT'S AN AMENDMENT WHICH SOUGHT AND BEEN REFUSED. FOR A BILL THE SUPPOSEDLY SERVES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CALIFORNIANS IT'S REFUSAL TO PROTECT EXISTING ACCESS PUZZLES ME. AB THIRTY THIRTY CALLS FOR PROTECTION BUT THE TERMS MEETING IS OPAQUE. I SPENT HOURS WITH THE SPONSORS FUTILELY TRYING TO MAKE THE LANGUAGE MEANINGFUL. WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE SUPPORTERS PUBLIC STATEMENTS IT'S A PAY EQUITY PROTECTION. WITH AREAS THAT SPECIFICALLY ELIMINATE FISHING ACCESS. AND THEIR GOAL IS TO DOUBLE THESE FISHING CLOSURES THAT COMES FROM THE PROPONENTS SUGGESTED THAT ONLY 16% CALIFORNIA'S WATERS ARE PROTECTED AND THOSE ARE THE AREAS. THAT LIMIT OR ELIMINATE FISHING. THAT DEFINITION OF PROTECTION IS FAR NARROWER THAN IS INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED IN FACT WELL MANAGED AND SUSTAINABLE FISHING IS COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE WITH BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION IN AB THIRTY THIRTY IT NOR IS THIS. AND WHILE IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AT NINE IS REALLY NEEDED ALREADY EXISTS. THE LEGISLATURE MUST PROVIDE THE ADMINISTRATION WITH BETTER GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICATION OF THE OPERATIONAL GOALS IN SB THIRTY THIRD. THE BILL'S LACK OF CLARITY JEOPARDIZES CONTINUED ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL AND SPORT FISHING ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE HUGE EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FISHING IS A TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY SUPPORTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND JOBS. THE STATE'S OWN WILDLIFE ACTION PLAN STATES THAT SPORTFISHING AND HUNTING PUMPS SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY INTO CALIFORNIA COPY KANEMI. AND SUPPORTS FIFTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIA JOBS. THIS BILL IS NOT READY TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS LAW. ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU SIR AND THAT WAS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES WE WILL NOW MOVE TO. MR TAYLOR ROSHEN. WHO WILL HAVE ABOUT ONE MINUTE TWENTY SECONDS REMAINING. GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS KILLED RUSSIAN WITH THE FARM BUREAU AND MEMBERS OF OUR COALITION REPRESENT MOST OF THE PRIVATE LANDHOLDERS IN THE STATE AND WE AGREED TO PROTECTING. CALIFORNIANS WORKING LANDSCAPE IS ABOUT MOST MOST IMPORTANT THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOMETHING WE BE SUPPORTIVE OF BUT WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD. WITHOUT THE DETAIL THE BILL RESPECTFULLY HAS ISSUES THIRTY THIRTY TESTIFIED THE PROTECTED LANDS OTHER THAN DURING DURING MEASURES MEANING IN PERPETUITY THE FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES UNDER THE STATE'S LARGEST AND MOST POPULAR AND MOST SUCCESSFUL IN PROTECTION PROGRAM HE ONE BLACK WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS PROTECTED UNDER THE BILL. THIRTY THIRTY ALSO REQUIRED LAND BE MANAGED FOR BIODIVERSITY CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND YOU GOT WE SERVICE THOSE STATE FEDERAL AND PRIVATELY FUNDED CONSERVATION AGRICULTURAL EVENING DON'T INCLUDE THESE CRITERIA. ANOTHER ADDITIONAL MILLIONS OF ACRE WOULDN'T MEET THAT STANDARD IT'S ALREADY INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AFTER PRIVATE LANDHOLDER TO FOR THE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT IN UNDER AN EASEMENT BUT I REMEMBER TO IT BECUSE THEY BELIEVE IN EACH OF THE LAND PROTECTIONS THE LANE REDUCTION OF CONDITIONS ON THE DECLINE- AFTER POSTING A BILL WILL CALL THAT COMMITMENT. THIRTY THIRTY ALSO SUFFERS FROM PRACTICAL ISSUE AS WE NOW KNOW. THAT LIKE I DIDN'T. IT GOT THE CALL. THEM PROVIDE FOR LEGISLATIVE UP OVER. DOESN'T DISCUSS HOW DATA BE COLLECTED ATTRACT PROGRESS IN A- CAN. WORK LANDS NATURAL LAND. EACH OF THOSE PLAN ARE UNIQUE AND- TO THINK MAN. AND POLICY PER. BUT A TIME THAT WE AGREE WITH AS MANY.

WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW- AND BEFORE WE START I WANT TO URGE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK. TO THE COMMITTE ROOM WE WILL CLOSE OUT THIS BILL FIRST WITH CONVERSATION AND THEN A VOTE AND THEN WE WILL OPEN THE ROLE. OPEN SADDAM. I WANT TO THANK THOSE HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE FOR YOUR PATIENCE- BRINGING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I'M GOING TO GO FIRST TO. SENATOR STERN. WHOSE FIRST IN THE QUEUE AND THEN I RECOGNIZE SENATOR HUESO FOLLOWING SENATOR STERN. SENATOR STERN THE FLOOR'S YOURS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANKS FOR DOING SUCH AN EXCELLENT JOB OF PRESIDING IN MY ABSENCE HERE TODAY- DO TO. KOBE RELATED CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT UP THERE BUT I DO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PUBLIC TESTIMONY TODAY- AND FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. THAT WE ARE IN A VERY SPECIAL STATE WITH TREMENDOUS BIODIVERSITY IN OUR RESOURCES. AND WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE ALSO OF A MASS EXTINCTION EVENT BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND ABROAD SO- THE BILL TODAY BEFORE US I FIND TO BE INCREDIBLY TIMELY AND IMPORTANT- BUT I ALSO THINK THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDINGS HERE THAT. I WISH COULDHAVE BEEN RESOLVED BEFORE THIS HEARING- I MYSELF GREW UP AS A AS AN ANGLER- FREE DIET BEING AND SPEAR FISHING AS WELL. OF THE SEVEN. COAST AND IN AREA WHERE THERE WAS A MARINE PROTECTED AREA WITH NO TAKE ALLOWANCES AND THEN RIGHT NEXT DOOR- SOME LIMITED TAKE OPPORTUNITIES AND- I SAW. FROM MY FRIENDS AND- WELL I GREW UP WITH AND STILL STILL STAY CLOSE TO A TREMENDOUS STEWARDSHIP OF OUR LAND AND I THINK THE SAME COULD BE SAID FOR. MANY OF THE WILD SHEEP FOLKS IN THE DEAR FOLKS IN A LOT OF OTHERS WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR LAND- I DON'T CONSIDER THIS BILL IN ANY WAY AN INDICTMENT OR RESTRICTION ON THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND WE REALLY TRIED THROUGH THE COMMITTEE TEN MINS- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH ALL THE CALLERS WERE IN FACT BRIEFED ON. THE WORK WE DID HE OR ZACHARY YOU WERE TOLD THIS BILL DOES. THERE WAS. IT DEPENDS MAY BE ADDED I WANT TO SORT OF SET THE WHATEVER PER STAY HAVE BEEN MADE ASIDE WEEK WEEK WE GOVERN IN LAW HERE AND THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL MATTERS- THE AMENDMENTS MADE MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT CONTRAVENE ANY OTHER EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS SO WHETHER THAT'S- A MARINE PROTECTED AREAS- THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE TO AND AROUND THAT PROCESS AND FORCE- SOME. ON CALIFORNIA FISHING INDUSTRY. LIKEWISE DIDN'T THE MEASURE THE AMENDMENTS MAKE CLEAR THAT BOTH RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL STAKEHOLDERS ARE NOW GOING TO BE DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE. CUT OUT FROM THE CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD WE WANT YOU TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN FACT IF WE'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS GLOBAL CRISIS WE NEED. THEIR OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORT ON THIS BILL TO BOTH BE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE TO PROTECT OUR LANDS- FROM LOSING ALL LIVING SPECIES IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES- SO. THE BILL IN ADDITION ALLOWING COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE AND MAKING CLEAR THAT WE DON'T UNDERMINE ANY OTHER EXISTING LAWS THE ONE OTHER PIECE I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT MAY PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CLARITY. THAN THAN SOME OF THE PAST YOU'RE GOING ON AROUND THE BILL- IS THAT IT ALSO WON'T A DISINCENTIVE EYES OR UNDERCUT THE ABILITY FOR FOLKS TO ENTER SAY CONSERVATION EASEMENT IN FACT THE BILL EXPLICITLY MAKES REFERENCE TO WORKING WITH WILLING. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS- WE THINK THAT ON OUR FARMLANDS. OR OUR- OUR DUCK CLUBS THAT WORK WITH OUR RICE FARMERS OR OTHER KINDS OF RESERVES OUT THERE THE DOCTOR IN FACT EXCELLENT AN INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE USES OF CALIFORNIA LANDED BOTH SURVIVE DIVERSITY AND- AND ALLOW US TO- CONTINUE TO- GO THROUGH EITHER RECREATIONAL COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY SO. I'M A BIT DAY. OF PROTECT DOES. PUT CONSERVATION BUT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR INTERESTS ARE OF THE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO OUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE LAST IN A I THINK THAT. THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION THAT. IN TWO SUPPORT SHARE THIS SENATE NATURAL IN WATER TO ANISSA YOU A JUROR EQUITY STE IN SEEING HEALTHY GOES THE DOES KALAU HERE IN WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE END OF SAY ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN LION OR GARIBALDI- THE DO YOU KNOW THE GIANT WHITE SEA BASS- YOU KNOW OR OR SOME OF OUR OTHER THREATEN TRES REAL SPECIES. WE CAN DO BOTH HERE I THINK THIS BILL IS READY- I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE SOME IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION. AND I REALLY HOPE THAT I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH IN ENGAGEMENT- FROM THE OPPONENTS ABOUT THE MEANINGFUL AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE MEASURE OR HOW HOW FAR WE TRIED TO PUSH HERE. BUT I HOPE AT LEAST THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MAY BE TOLD THAT THIS BILL WILL SHUT OFF YOUR ABILITY TO BE AN ANGLER HUNTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE I RECOGNIZE THE- THAT PEOPLE MAYBE WANT A LITTLE MORE GRANULARITY IN THE DEFINITION BUT I THINK THE FLEXIBILITY IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO ALLOWING SOME OF THESE OTHER USES BEING ENGAGED SO. I'M GONNA BE SUPPORT THE MEASURE TODAY AND I DO APPRECIATE. EVERYONE'S EFFORTS HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN IN ORDER I RECOGNIZE CENTER REQUEST SO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GIVEN THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN GUIDELINES BY WHICH WE MUST CONFORM AN ASSET TO REMOVE BILLS THAT WERE NOT RELATED TO COVERT AND EVEN I HAD BILLS THAT WERE REMOVED THAT WERE COVERED RELATED I WANNA SEE AUTHORED TERMS OF WHAT IS THIS BILLS CONNECTIONS CO THE CRISIS CURRENTLY THAT WAS MY CONCERN AS WELL. THANK YOU CENTER WAS. THANK YOU- FOR THAT QUESTION ANYA THE CUT THE PUT THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC UNDERSCORES. THE PROTECTION OF FRAGILE INTACT ECOSYSTEMS CRITICAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH WELL BEING- NOT ONLY. IS THE PROTECTION OF OUR BIODIVERSITY AND- OUR OUR ECOSYSTEMS CRITICAL BUT WE CAN SEE RIGHT NOW IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO SHELTER AT HOME. THAT ACCESS TO AN EVENT AND AVAILABILITY- AND THE PRESENCE OF OUR OPEN SPACES AND PROTECTED SPACES- HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW RESPITE THREE BEEN ALLOWED. TO AN AGENT. AS TO THE PROTECTIONS OF THE ECOSYSTEMS DO NOT DISEASES LIKE OVER NINETEEN RESULT FROM HUMAN WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS LIKE THOSE THAT OCCURRED- IT THROUGH INCLUSION ON WILDLIFE HABITAT PROTECTING MORE OPEN SPACE WILL DECREASE HUMAN CONTACT WILDLIFE TO TRAVEL DECREASES BUT AS OXY'S IS HUMANS- I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SORRY YOU'RE YOU'RE RACING THROUGH SOMETHING FOR- IT THE- A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO ONE IS A PROTECT PROTECT MORE OPEN DECREASES HUMAN CONTACT WITH WILDLIFE WHICH IN TURN WILL DO THIS FOR. HUMAN SIGN UP FOR JUST GOT I'M TRYING TO GET SOME BREAD FROM BUT YOU EXT THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FIGHTING COVETED TWENTY THIRTY. IF IT'S NOT OPEN TO BE OTHER. RESULTS OF US NOT- NOT BEING CONSCIOUS OF PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT AND WE'VE SEEN INCREASE OF DISEASE IS BASED UPON OUR DESTRUCTION ABOUT DIVERSITY. ABOUT SEPARATE FROM THAT IS THE IDEA OF HAVING ENSURING I THINK THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF SHOWN ACCESS TO MEANINGFUL RECREATION. OUTDOOR SPACES WATER. OCEAN RIVER WAYS PARKS OPEN SPACES HAS BEEN CRITICAL FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH IN REVIEWING YOUR BILL IT HAS NO MENTION OF ACCESS AND I'LL I'LL EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE- I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA'S COAST AND OPEN SPACES AND A LOT OF THOSE ARE PROTECTED AND DON'T ALLOW ACCESS. AND YOUR BILL HAS NO MENTION RELATED TO ACCESS AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WERE ALLOWED TO ACCESS OPEN SPACE AND HIS. ARE BOTH LOCKED. SO I WILL LIKE TO SEE IS LEVEL OF MENTION THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. THAT WE MAKE REFERENCE TO ACCESS BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING THAT ARGUMENT FROM THE PODIUM BUT IT'S NOT IN THE BILL. OF THAT THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS HIS- THE 30% NUMBER WHAT'S THAT I MEAN I MEAN. I'M% I'M OK IF IT'S NOT BUT I JUST WANT UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT AMOUNT OF LAND. AND HAS SINCE BEEN ABLE HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO BECAUSE WE HAVE. FEDERAL BLM LANDS WE HAVE STATE LANDS WE HAVE FEDERAL. PARK LANDS WE HAVE. BOB PROTECTED LANDS THAT WE'VE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH PRIVATE OWNERS WE YOU KNOW FRANKLY THERE ARE SOME REALLY REACH BRIDGE PEOPLE ON THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY TO PURCHASE LAND AROUND THEIR PROPERTY SO THAT THEY'RE NEVER DEVELOPED. WELL IT IT SERVES FOR TWO PURPOSES TO PROTECT OUR COASTAL VIEWS I GET IT AND THAT NOBODY EVER BUT IT ALSO HAS. A OF UP TO PROTECT THAT LAND FOR MARINE DIVERSITY AND THEY GET A BIG TAX BREAK IN DOING THAT. THEY THEY THEY RAISE MONEY TO A NON TO ACCESS A SLOW AND THEN. THEY GET TO BASICALLY USE IT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSE BUT THERE'S NO PUBLIC ACCESS AND THAT I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT ENGAGING IN THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY TO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY. HELP US WITH WITH ACCESS AND FROM MUCH MORE LIMITED BENEFITS AND I. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO THAT IN POOR AREAS WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IN AND RICH AREAS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE POOR PEOPLE LIVE. THEY DON'T GET ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE AND PROTECTED LANDS AND FAXES TO REVIEW SPECIES AND INTERACT WITH THEM AND HOPEFULLY LEARN ABOUT THEIR THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECTING THEMSELVES THAT'S THE STORY OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M NOT INTERESTED N FURTHERING A POLICY THAT WILL DO THAT AND- SO THAT'S WHY I ACCESS IS IMPORTANT STRATEGIC. LOCATION OF THESE IS ALSO IMPORTANT I. AND THAT'S NOT MENTIONED IN THE BILL AS WELL. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IF YOU COULD WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH A 30% NUMBER AND HOW MUCH DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE. UNDER PROTECTION INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST OF ALL IF I COULD- SUNDER- THE BILL DOES SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT IS THE GOAL OF THE STATE EVEN THIS BILL. REPRESENTING THAT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO NATURE FOR ALL PEOPLE BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY I WAS RULES ONE OF THE KEYS GROUP OF CO SPONSORS. OF THIS BILL AND HOW DO YOU FIND ALL PEOPLE THOUGH I MEAN WHEN YOU GO INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY PRO COUNTY THAT. AREAS IN MY COMMUNITY SAN DIEGO IT SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME AYE WE HAVE TO PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. TO GET PEOPLE FROM ENGLAND TO THE COAST. UNLESS SOMETHING THROUGH A DIRECT. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND IF I MEAN OF THE BILL IS MORE SPECIFIC ON THAT I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS IMPORTANT YES NO THANK YOU- THE BUILD ACTUALLY THAT'S PART OF. ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE BILL PAYS FOR IT TOO AS WE- PROTECT LANDS A PRACTICAL. PRECIPITATING WAS NEVER NOT PRESCRIPTIVE AND HOW WE DO IT. BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS A THE GO. HOWEVER IT DOES VERY SPUR. STATE PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE IS A RECOGNITION AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING. THAT ALTHOUGH WE GET A LOT OF PARKS BONDS AND MONEY TO. PRESERVE COULD CONSERVE OUR PROTECT LANDS. THAT IT'S OFTEN TIMES IN DIFFERENT CORNERS THE STATE FAR AWAY FROM URBAN COMMUNITIES FAR AWAY FROM POPULATION CENTERS- AND SO WE WANT AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. ALSO ACCESS AS WELL- THAT TO IT DOESN'T DO MUCH GOOD TO COMMUNITIES I DON'T HAVE ACCESS OF COURSE LATTICES. HUNTER PERCENT PRIDED AND BLOCKED OFF. TO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY OUT THIS. BILL WITH A WILL WITH BILLING. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS COULD ALLOW. FOR A- OF THE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS TO ALLOW PUBLIC ACCESS. TO THE BEACH IS THAT A LOT AND- THE POSTAL REGION AS WELL. BUT BILL VERY SPECIFICALLY DOES- EVER DOES SPEAK TO THAT AND IF YOU KNOW IF I KNOW MARSEILLE FROM AS LITTLE AS ONE OF THE- IT. WAS ONE OF MY PRESENTED TODAY. THE M. BLOUSE CAN SPEAK THE ACT ASP BECAUSE THAT'S PRIMARY REASON WHY I ABLE. SIGNED ON AS OPPOSED. A CENTER. FROM THE ALL. YES SHE'S ON THE RIGHT NOW. I WOULD ASK THEM ON TO WIN THIS YEAH. THANK YOU CAN USE IF THE- WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- IS STILL AVAILABLE- FROM US TO MARS I AM. PLEASE DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION FROM SENATOR HUESO ABOUT ACCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CAN I WANT THE ACTUALLY THE MONTHS INSTEAD OF THE OTHER I'M NOT DECISION IN YOUR DISTRICT I GREW UP IN YOUR DISTRICT- WHEN WE SAY ALL CALIFORNIANS WE NEED ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT IS OUR STRONG BELIEF. THAT THE CULT OF CALIFORNIANS BELONG JUST AS MUCH AS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE IN THE COASTAL THE CODE AS THE FOLKS THAT DRIVE TWO THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AWAY. HIS TO ENJOY THEMSELVES- THAT IS THE EXTREMELY- IMPORTANT TO THE INTENT OF THE SPELL IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS FOOTBALL CLUB. pPROTECTION THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT ACCESSIBLE IN. THERE IN THE CLOSE ARE GOING TO BE OPEN TAXES. DID YOU HEAR THAT. I DON'T I I'M I'M SORRY I DON'T THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION OKAY I THINK THAT IF IT'S IF IT'S PRIVATELY ONLINE YOU CAN'T FORCE APRIVATE NO I'M NOT ASKING APPROACH ONLY LANDED PROTECTION YES AS I'VE DRIVEN SWATS I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA COASTLINE FROM THE OREGON BORDER TO SAN DIEGO ON. THEIR ENORMOUS ARE ENORMOUS WHAT'S THAT ARE NOT A CIVIL. AND THEY'RE NOT PRIVATE OWNED AND SO THANK YOU. WATCH CONFLICT 30% NUMBER HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE CURRENTLY UNDER PROTECTION. THERE ARE DIFFERENT S. VINCE THAT INDICATE THAT AT LEAST 22% OF OUR LAND IT. IS CONSIDERED A PROTECTED. AND THE LEAST AROUND 16% OF THE STATE'S OCEAN WATERS I DO WANT TO MAKE IT VERYCLEAR- THAT WITH AMENDMENTS THAT- 30% OF THE EIGHT OCEAN ASPECT OF THE BILL IS IT VAST POTENTIAL 30% THE NATION'S OCEANS BY TWENTY THIRTY IS NOT A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC. GOAL SO THE CONCERN OF 30% WOULD ALSO INCLUDE 30% CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE OF ME 30% OF THE ENTIRE NATION IT'S A IT'S A NATIONAL GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE AND TO HAVE CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. TROUBLED CENTER OF THE NATION'S OCEANS SO THAT WOULD BE- UP POLICY MAKING PROCESS SOME QUESTION TEN. GIVE ME GIVE ME WORKING WITH STATES AS BE DONE MANY TIMES BE WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL AND- HAS. BEEN WRITTEN LOOKING AT ARGUMENTS HERE I SAW THAT. OTHER WAS A CLARIFICATION RELATED TO THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS THE REPORT ON THE SAYS. AMENDMENTS ALL DELETED ALL REFERENCES TO MARINE PROTECTED AREAS DOES THAT MEAN. THAT WE'RE GONNA LIMONITE FROM PROTECTED AREAS OR INCLUDE THEM IN THE 30% OR IN ADDITION TO THE 30% OF A RIGHT NOW. IF YOU'D PREFER TO STOP ANALYSIS THE MPA ARE INCLUDED AS PART OF WATERS CONSERVE INTO A HUNDRED IN NINETEEN OF. PEARSON THAT WHAT BUT- THIS WAS THE DIRECTOR OSCAR THE RECREATIONAL. FISHING GROUP I DO LIVE ANYWHERE. TWEET. TO GO TO. TATIAN A LIFE PROTECTION ACT WE LIKE PENSION ACT WE COMPLIED WITH THEIR ASK AND AMENDED DELETE A REFERENCE OKAY AND IT COULD BE. THE PROTECT IN THE 4% PAPA FOR I'M IF WE CALIFORNIANS MORE OF THE WATERWAYS OF THE- OF THE NATION. I MEAN IT WORK I MEAN IF WE TECH A PROPORTIONATE WE SHOULD BE THIRTY BUT IF WE DO DISPROPORTION WOULD BE ABOUT THIRTY IN THE OCEAN POSSIBLY. IS DONE THE RIGHT WAY I MEAN I THINK THE BEST THAT THE KEY IS PROTECTING OUR BIODIVERSITY KEYS PROTECTING. AND CAN YOU KNOW THE PROTECTION OF THE OUR WATERS AND OUR LAND ACTUALLY. ALLOWS FOR MORE FISHING AND HUNTING BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE PROTECTING FROM- THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OKAY DIVERSITY. AND YOU THAT COULD BE STATE. NOT MISTAKEN ANOTHER COASTLINE PROTECT POSSIBLY. BECAUSE YOU SAID WE'RE AT 60% OF US MARINE PROTECTED AREAS OF ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATES AS INDICATED IN THE AND THE STAFF ANALYSIS- SO THIS FIFTY TO THE STATE OPTIONS WHAT IS CONSERVING A HUNDRED OKAY FOR MARINE MANAGED AREAS. AND AGAIN BE WE- TOOK OUT NPA'S AT THE REQUEST AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT WE DO WE DEFINE THAT BECAUSE SINCE AND WE HAVE AREAS THAT ARE NOT PROTECT MARINE PROTECTED AREAS BUT ARE ALSO PROTECTED AREAS. ALONG SAN DIEGO BAY ALONG SENEGAL COAST AND- THOSE BE ADDED TO THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER ABSOLUTELY THE OF IT I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE PERCENTAGE IS PROBABLY MUCH HIGHER THAN A ACCESSIBLE DATA POINT BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO FIND THOSE THE MARINE MANAGER UP TO THAT PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION HOPEFULLY THE THAT IS THE CASE WILL INTO THAT ALSO. YOU THE BILL ADDRESS DOES. RUMOR% CULTURAL SO ACCESS TO NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THERE ARE ALSO SOME UNTREATED I MEAN WE'VE DECIMATED. THE IN THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO PRESERVE THE CULTURE AND MERRY MANY AREAS PART OF THEIR CULTURE- POSSESSES HUNDING CERTAIN HUNTING TRADITIONS. AND THEY THEY HUNT IN CERTAIN WAYS THAT- SHOULD BE ALLOWED THAT CURRENTLY ARE VERY RESTRICTED AND I JUST WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD WOULD BE WILLING TO ADD THAT TO THE BILL. TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHERE WHERE APPLICABLE. YEAH BUT WORKING VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE TRIBES TRIBAL NON TRIBAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THANK YOU ARE NOT IMPEDING ON THEIR CULTURAL HERITAGE OR- THEIR WAY OF LIFE THAT WOULD THAT WAS IMPORTANT ARE IMPORTANT TOO I GUESS AT TO THE BILL. ALSO A BILL IN LIKE A MEDICARE. DRUG PLAN WITH AN ARTY YES WONDER IF I COULD OFFER JUST A COUPLE POINTS I'M JUST A MOMENT THIS. IS FREAKING ICE I APPRECIATE KNOWING YOU'RE THERE AND ALSO GONNA WRECK NICE MOMENT THERE'S ANOTHER. PERSON PRESS ONE TO DRESS THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION WHICH I WILL NOW I WANNA THIS FINISH. FIRST UNLESS SENATORS WILLING TO HEAR FROM IN OUR DC. IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU. I THINK BE IF A LOT I HAVE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE RESPONSE BUT- REGARDING. YOUR POLICY THIRTY NINE YEAR AND THAT WOULD GAUGE FEDERAL MEN AT WORK IN A NATIONWIDE POLICY WOULD BE. ALSO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO. MAKE SOME OF THAT LAND AVAILABLE FOR CONSERVATION ABSOLUTELY I MEAN LOOK THIS THE IDEA BEHIND THE BILL DOESN'T MENTION BE ELEMENTS. OF THE- THE IDEA OF THIS BILL IS TO. WORK WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS FEDERAL. STATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COUNTIES AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE SO I SAID YOU HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY THAT THAT WAY IT'LL BE UNDERSTOOD CRITICISM THAT WERE BEING TOO PRESCRIPTIVE AS TO HOW TO DO IT. IT SAYS THE GOAL AND ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO WORK WITH OTHER PARTNERS BUT TO ACCESS POTENTIAL FUNDING FOR FEDERAL GRANTS. IN IN PARTNER WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRIVATE GRANTS WHAT HAD YOU LOOKING PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WILLINGLY- BUT YOU KNOW AS AS THEY AS THEY CHOOSE- AND SO THERE IS A VARIETY OF WAYS WE CAN ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. AND THAT INCLUDES WERE FEDERAL MEANT. THANK YOU EN. YOU KNOW THE LAST ISSUE. THE SENEGAL. I NEED TO SUPPORT MY DOES AND HE'S MY MOTHER JOBS IN MY DISTRICT AND OF COURSE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY THAT BRINGS A LOT OF TOURISTS TO SAN DIEGO BUT ALSO- YOU KNOW SUPPORTS- YOU KNOW IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS REALLY DEPENDS ON THE SAN DIEGO COASTLINE. THE EXORCIST AND IT'S ONE THAT BRINGS UP LOTS OF A SPIN. SUPPORT TO OUR ECONOMY AND PROVIDE JOBS TO FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES BUT IS ALSO WAY TO SOURCE FOOD. FOR A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT USE THIS METHOD TO ALSO SEARCH PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND IT'S AN- METHOD OF- YOU KNOW FEEDING YOUR FAMILY. AND RECREATING THAT SAME TIME SO IT IT CHECKS A LOT OF BOXES AND I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO PROTECT THAT INDUSTRY. MAKE THAT THEY THAT THE STATE. WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE COMPETING WITH WITH. OTHER OUTSIDE. YOU KNOW COUNTRIES LIKE YOU KNOW JAPAN IF YOU GO TO JAPAN THE FIRST LARGEST. FISH FISH MARKET IN THE WORLD. NUMBER ONE IS IN JAPAN THE SECOND LARGEST IS IN JAPAN THE THIRD LARGEST IN JAPAN. THEY IN THE CONSTRUCT CONSUME ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FISSION. WELL TIMES ARE FISHING OFF OF OUR COASTLINE. TO MATT THAT PUTS ARC FISHERMEN IN DIRECT COMPETITION. WITH THAT INDUSTRY AND OF COURSE A LOT OF THESE- INDIVIDUAL SUPPLY TO OUR LOCAL MARKETS INCLUDING OUR MARKET IN SAN DIEGO WHICH IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE SAN. AND THE CURRENT THREE SO. I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU. TO WORK WITH THAT INDUSTRY PROVIDE SOME ASSURANCES THAT THEIR INDUSTRY WILL BE PROTECTED IN THIS I THINK THERE IS A WAY TO PROTECT OUR COASTLINE AND THE INDUSTRY AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THERE'S A WAY I THINK WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND I HOPE THAT- YOU'RE WILLING TO PUT ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO. ASSUAGE THE FEARS GET THEM ON BOARD TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW. WHAT WHEN I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING OUR COASTLINE. AND HOW THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FISHERIES IS TAKING PLACE I THINK FOR DOING A FANTASTIC JOB OF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE THEY ARE. OF THAT ENDEAVOR IN A LOT OF THEM ARE HELPING TO FUND. MANAGEMENT LIMON TOP. WE'RE GONNA BE PRETTY MUCH SERVING UP FOR FISH TO JAPAN. AND ELIMINATING THOSE ABSENT A MILK MILK LEMONADE IN OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS. A SUPER FOOD LOCALLY. OFFER ON COASTLIES AND JUST ADDING TO THE WHOLE PUBLICATION OF THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY. I DON'T SUPPORT. SO I'VE- THIS IS A- THIS BILL BUT I THINK IT'S SOME THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE BY TWENTY THIRTY. OF UP YOU KNOW SPUR SUPPORTED NON HOPE THAT WE CAN REVEAL HE'LL ADDRESS THOSE POINTS ARE BROUGHT UP IN. HI. I THOUGHT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO. I WORK FOR ME ON THIS AND HOPEFULLY WE COULD- A SUITE OF FEATURES OF FISHING INDUSTRY MAKE SURE THEY FEEL REPRESENTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO AND WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS IS THE TIME FOR COMMITTEE DISCUSSION. WE DO HAVE THE ENERGY SEEING EXPERT ON THE LINE TO ANSWER ONE OF CENTER PLACES QUESTIONS. THERE IS SOMEBODY. HERE IN THE ROOM I'M GOING TO FORWARD YOU A MOMENT TO IT I THINK YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO ONE OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY SENATOR HUESO. PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF AGAIN AND IF YOU PROVIDE A BRIEF. COMMENT THIS WILL NOT BE FOR EXCHANGE WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OR THE AUTHOR PLEASE. AND THEN WE'LL GO TO ENERGY C. WITNESS MISTER CHAIR MEMBER MARC SMITH I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE RECREATIONAL ANGLING COMMUNITY I THINK YOUR CALL SINCE. PART THE BILL. CONCERT BILLS WHAT DID. YOU PER. IF YOU GO TO THE NET RESOURCES. WEBPAGE IN THEIR- THEY SAY 47% OF LANDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE PROTECTED. IF YOU TAKE THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS WHICH ARE 60% ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT. NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT EXIST OFF OUR COASTLINE WE ARE WELL ABOVE 30% BUT WHEN THE SPONSORS TALK ABOUT THE BILL THEY SAY ONLY 22% OF ANDS ARE PROTECTED IN ONLY 60% OF THE OCEAN WHICH MEANS THEY'RE EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSING ON EITHER MPAS. OR SOME SUBSET OF THE LAND PROTECTION. WE DON'T HAVE CLARITY ON WHAT THE BILL MEANS THE BILL DOES NOT DEFINE THESE TERMS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY WHAT WE HAD ASKED FOR. WAS COMMITTEES CENTER WE SAW THROUGH THE CHAIR THIS IS NOT FOR DIALOGUE WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION PLEASE PLEASE FINISH YOUR COMMENT AND THEN I AM GOING TO GO TO THE WITNESS FROM ENERGY CEO I THINK ARE POOR. REMAIN THAT. HAVE WORK HOURS WITH THE SPONSORS HAVE NEGOTIATED AMENDMENTS BACK AND FORTH AND WERE UNABLE TO REACH A CONCLUSION ABOUT DEFINING THE TERM PROTECTION IN WAY THAT I. NOTICED THIS IS A SERVER SENATE DOCTOR. COMBINED YEAH. ARE GREATER THAN 30% WHERE IS THE FISH. THAT BONDS ARE. EMPLOYED EXIST BUT NOT A- AND THEN THE LEADS US THINK. YOU KNOW FOR ONLY TWO ABOUT SIXTY PER. BUT FROM THEIR PURSE. THEY'RE GOING TO ANOTHER FOR. PER OF AND- WHICH IS. FISHING RISK. WE NEED TO COME TO CONSENSUS AND UNDERSTANDING ON THIS. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO IT IN THE REMAINING THREE WEEKS THIS IS BEEN AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. WE HAVE PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD I. AT THE SPONSORED TELL YOU THE SAME THING. THIS IS A BILL THAT WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND WE'RE TRYING TO RUSH IT THROUGH IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS IN AN ERA AND IN A TIME IN WHICH WE CANNOT HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION. EACH OTHER LET ALONE WHAT DO YOU. THINK THE SOLUTION MAKER I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT- WILL LET THE AUTHOR ADDRESSED THAT IN HIS CLOTHES. I'M GONNA GO TO THE WITNESS FROM IN OUR DC. HAS RELIED UPON BY THE AUTHOR. TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY SENATOR HUESO. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR- MISTER HUNT. THANK YOU CHAIR- FIRST REGARDING THE 30% FIGURE AND ITS ORIGIN. 30% FIGURE COMES FROM- WHAT SCIENTIFIC GLOBALLY AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE- WORK. ON ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA OR LIVE IN CALIFORNIA HAS WRITTEN TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE IS REQUIRED. IN ORDER TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY AND ADDRESS ISSUES AROUND CLIMATE RESILIENCE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY FACING. WE DIDN'T THAT NOW. IN CAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE TYPES OF PROTECTION THAT ARE CALLED FOR BY THE DEFINITION OF PROTECT. ESTABLISHES THAT ON LAND PERHAPS I WOULD ABOUT TWENTY TWO PERCENT. OF AREAS ARE PROTECTED- AND AGAIN THE DEFINITION OF PROTECT RELIED ON TERMS AND WE'VE WE'VE AMENDED IT COULD DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY THAT MR SAID JUST READ. IT RELIES ON TERMS THAT THE PUBLIC RESOURCE CODE USES THAT THE AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING CONSERVATION PROGRAMS PROTECTION PROGRAMS MIGLIOR. WITH AND UNDERSTAND. I IT'S NOT A MESS. IT DOES ADDRESS- BIG CONCERN THAT WE'VE BEEN THAT WE'VE BEEN FACING DROUGHT AND WITH RESPECT TO THE OCEAN. IT'S AN INTERESTING IT'S INTERESTING- POSITION THAT THAT THE INDUSTRIES ARE TAKING CARE. IF THE PRACTICES THAT THEY ENGAGE IN UNPROTECTED. IN THAT IT PAYS TO PROVIDE CONTRIVING BIODIVERSITY AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT DEFINITION ALLOWS FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ABOUT DIVERSITY. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IT MEANS IS RESULT IN REDUCED ACCESS TO SPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT. THAT IT DOESN'T CALLS FOR EXPANSION OF AT GREAT PROTECTED AREAS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE DEFINITION COULD NOT LIMIT THE TYPES OF PROTECTIONS ONLY TO THOSE. FOUND IN PARTICULARLY. LONG BIODIVERSITY IS AND ON THE ON THE REASON FOR PROTECTING AN AREA MANY OTHER USES COULD BE. ALLOWED IN THOSE AREAS I ALSO WANTED TO JUST POINT OUT TO. MISTER HUESO AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS PROPERTY CUTTING TRADITIONAL USES BY MAJOR MERICAN TRIED OTHER INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE. AND IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE FOURTEEN THIRTEEN OF FOURTEEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED THAT YOU CAN SEE AN INTENSE SECTION OF THE BILL SPECIFIC RECOGNITION OF THE ISSUES AND THE IMPORTANCE. OF READING TRADITIONALLY CLOSE ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AS- EQUAL TO OUR- KNOWLEDGE THAT WE DEPEND ON THAT TREE AND IN OUR IN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR CULTURE. AND IT'S THE TYPICALLY CALLED ON THE STATE. SOMETHING IT SHOULD DO NOT MANDATORY BUT SHOULD. BOB CAN SOLVE WITH MADE IN AMERICAN TRIBES WHEN CONSERVATION AFRICAN BACK TRAVEL AND SOCIAL THANK YOU MISTER HUNT WE APPRECIATE OUR GRATIFICATIONS I AM NOW GOING TO GO TO SENATOR BRANDIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THINK. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO HAD STARTED OFF WITH A QUESTION THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO ASK BECAUSEIT ALSO BEARS DIRECTLY ON. THE URGENCY OF THIS MATTER AND WHETHER NOT THAT EXISTS WE'VE BEEN ASKED. THAT WE DEAL. WITH RELATED MATTERS WILDFIRE IN HOUSING THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL- A RECOMMENDATION BY THE PRO TEM I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE SO MANY EXAMPLES THE FAT THAT WE'VE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE- PARAMETERS. AND I LOVE THE VERBAL GYMNASTICS OF TRYING TO CREATE A NEXUS THE CODE. IT GETS JUST MORE INNER ALL THE TIME- THAT IS A MAIN. I FIND I'M HARD PRESSED TO THINK IF THIS IS COVERED RELATED BUT MOVING BEYOND THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S HERE NOW THE CHAIRMAN DECIDED TO ALLOW THE ROSTER BILLS. TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE WAY THAT HE DID. BUT I'M LOOKING AT THIS. IT'S ALMOST AS IF THIS SEEMS. LIKE WE'RE JUMPING AHEAD OF A PROCESS I THINK- YOU'D APPRECIATE THIS AS AN ATTORNEY IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PROVIDE WANTED SAME LAW SCHOOL- SO I THINK- THE- IS THAT. IS THAT. THIS IS AN ASPIRATIONAL DOCUMENT. IT DOESN'T HAVE SET POLICIES IT DOES NOT HAVE METRICS IT DOES NOT HAVE CLEAR DIRECTION. EXCEPT FOR THE NOTION THAT WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT 30% IS ACHIEVED ART WHETHER IT BE THE NATIONAL LEVEL OR A COMBINATION OF STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OVERALL INTERNATIONAL SET OF OBLIGATIONS. BUT THE ISSUE IS. BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD IN THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS THAT RELY ON THESE RELATED INDUSTRIES THAT BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE IMPACTED. WOULD IT NOT BE APPROPRIATE. FOR US INSTEAD OF A MAN DAY A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE IN AN ASPIRATIONAL FORM OF THIRTY PERCENT. TO INSTEAD DIRECT THE STATE INSTRUMENTS THE STATE AGENCY AND IN THEIR IN THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENT. TO DEVISE WAYS THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT THINGS THEY WOULD DO TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. THE NUMBERS THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK WITH THE FEAR THAT WE'RE HEARING. FOLKS IN THE FISHERIES FOLKS IN WILDLIFE FOLKS IN AGRICULTURE. THE FEAR THAT WE'RE HEARING IN THEIR OPPOSITION. IS ONE OF. DISTRUST WE'RE WE'RE IS GOING TO GO IN COULD THIS ULTIMATELY IMPACT THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND I THINK THERE'S MERIT TO THAT IT'S THOSE SETS OF CONCERNS. SO WOULD IT MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO USE THIS LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE TO DIRECT THE STATE AGENTS. TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN PLEASE REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. ON HOW IT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN WHAT FASHION. SECOND PART OF THAT WOULD BE SINCE WE'RE IN COORDINATION. ON THE ROAD WITH OTHER STATES AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. HOW EXACTLY THEY WOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING. BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT IF WE'RE PUSHING THIS FROM A NATIONAL THE INTERNATIONAL STANDPOINT. AND WE AT WE I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS THAT WASHINGTON HAS DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES THAN CALIFORNIA. WILL CALIFORNIA ENDEAVOR TO MAKE UP THE SLACK. MEETING THAT WE COULD EXCEED THAT 30% IF THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA DOES NOT IN EFFORT TO MEET THE 30% INTERNATIONALLY OR NATIONALLY. SO YOU CAN SEE WHY THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE TERRIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND THEN LASTLY IS THAT IF WE REACHED. IT CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE FIT IN TO THIS LARGER AGENDA THAT'D BE MEMORIALIZED IN LEGISLATION AND BROUGHT BACK TO US SO MY ULTIMATE POINT IN ALL THIS IS THAT. THIS VEHICLE IT DOESN'T HAVE SUBSTANCE IT IT IS ASPIRATIONAL MANDATE. BUT THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE SO SEVERE THAT WE ARE ABDICATING OR LEGISLATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN ALLOWING REGULATORY AGENCIES THE WEIGHT OF THE LAW IN AUTHORITY TO DEVISE POLICIES TO ACHIEVE WHAT THIS LEGISLATION ENDEAVORS. AND THAT I THINK IS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS FOR THE TRADITION OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO MY POINT ALLEN ALLEN TO HEAR. IS THAT NOT ONLY IS NOT CODED RELATED AT ALL. WE ARE CREATING MORE UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET PLACE. AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE DESPERATE FOR JOBS IN CERTAINTY IN THE MARKETPLACE. AND LASTLY WE ARE NOT ACTING IN A LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY THAT GOES INTO SPECIFICITY ON WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN FOR RELATED AREAS OR INDUSTRIES. AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE DONE BASED ON THE COMMENT I HEARD JUST A MOMENT AGO THIS IS TO SIGNIFICANT. TO JAM THROUGH. IN AUGUST. WOULD IT WOULD NOT ALL BE BETTER SERVED IF THIS WERE BROUGHT IN JANUARY AND HAD THE FULL WEIGHT OF DEBATE IN THE FULL WEIGHT. OF THE EXPLICATION OF THE ISSUES. THANK YOU SENATOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE AT THIS POINT- OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IN YOUR CLOTHES. I'M ON THE APPOINTED- TO SAY LOOK. AT THE END OF THE DAY CENTER YOU KNOW WE COULD JUST. GET THIS THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE THEM TELL US. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING OR WE CAN SET THE GOAL AND ALLOW ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR AND AGAINST TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. OF ATTAINING THAT GOAL- AND PART OF THE AMENDMENTS. OR HAVE THE NATIONAL RESOURCE AGENCY BE. THE POINT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION A RESPONSE FOR. A OF THE METRICS. BUT WE'VE DONE THIS IN OTHER ARENAS AND IT'S MAKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE OR WHAT HAVE YOU WHAT WE SET A GOAL. OF AND DAN. HOW COULD I GOAL IS SET SUBSCRIPT LEGISLATION OR SUCH COULD MINISTRATION ACTION IS GOOD. HELPS US ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND SO. THAT WE CAN GO TO ADMINISTRATION I MEAN TO YOUR POINT. WITH THE MESSAGE I TELL THEM TO TELL US WHAT. WE WANT WHAT ONE TO DO WHAT WE CAN SAY THIS IS OUR GOAL BASS ON THE SIZE. AND BASED UPON THE FEEDBACK WE'VE GOTTEN BY THE WAY. THIS BILL. IS ASPIRATIONAL THIS BILL. CLICK TO DOESN'T INTENTIONALLY IS NOT PRESCRIPTIVE IN FACT SOME OF THE SPECIFICITY THAT WE STRUCK RESTRICT. BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY IN THERE AND SO DOT DOT. IT IS AN EFFORT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND EVERYONE ELSE THE SPONSORS AND THE OPPOSITION SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE OR TWENTY THIRTY THIRTY BY THIRTY GOAL TOGETHER AND IS THAT WHAT WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ON THE PER OF OTHER STATES WE HAVE ARTICLE SOUTH CAROLINA. IN THE LEGISLATURE NOT THERE BY THIRTY OF LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW AS WELL. THE IDEA IS TO GET ALL STATES ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST ONE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST SOUTH CAROLINA JUST CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO. A DEBIT ASAL EFFORT THAT I THINK ALL ALONG CENTER PARKS. OF THE- WE CAN LEAD THE APPS. BY LEE SAID IN A- AND THEN ONCE GOAL IS WE WERE WITH THE FITNESS. IS TO WHAT. IS AS TO. HOW TO BEST ACHIEVE AS WELL. AS WITH THE OTHER IN FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION THAT MAKES SENSE- AND THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED MONTHS AGO THERE'S NOT SOMETHING I JUST SHOWED UP. LOCKABLE WEEKS- AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING AND ACTIVE I'LL GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER ON TERMS TO ENGAGEMENT BUT YEAH THERE'S DIFFERENTWAYS. THIS IS AN APPROACHES. HEY WE HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ON THE APPROACH BUT I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO APPROACH IT. THANK YOU OUR- NEXT AND- HAVE. SENATOR JOHN. BY SENATOR CHECKS. SENATOR JOHN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO WANT TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN AWAY SOON CENTER BORDERS ON THE CONCERN ABOUT THE KOBE BUT I RAISE THAT ALREADY AND- TALKED ABOUT IT LAST WEEK AS WELL. AND I HAVE. SEVERAL TO COUPLE WEEKS OF. I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING HE PERCENTAGE OF- STATE LANDS CURRENTLY ARE PROTECTED. I BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA NATURI SERVICES AGENCY PUTS THE NUMBER CURRENTLY AT FORTY SEVEN. POINT ZERO FIVE PERCENT- I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE SCIENCE IS ON THAT ARE HOW THEY CAME UP THAT NUMBER BUT- YOU FOR THAT IS TO BE A PRETTY JUST TO ME ALSO I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US- AWARE OF THE TERM MASS EXTINCTION EVENT I THINK IS WHAT YOU SAID I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE NEW TER FOR- GLOBAL WARMING- GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE OR SEA LEVEL RISE- I'LL BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT TO COME UP- IN FUTURE CONVERSE. REGARDING THE SETTLED SCIENCE ON GLOBAL CHANGE. BUT ON YOUR BILL IN PARTICULAR I DO WANNA- DIG IN A LITTLE BIT DEEPER ON THE ACCESS. ACTIVATE I AM A BOARD MEMBER OF THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB IN MY AREA AND A FORMER WHEN I WAS A KID A MEMBER OF THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB SO I HAVE A AFFINITY AND I KNOW THAT A CENTER HUESO WHO DOES A LOT IN OUR AREA IN SAN DIEGO FOR ACCESS FOR- UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES TO GET INTO OUR- A NATURAL AREAS- YOU KNOW. ANZA BORREGO STATE PARK IS THE LARGEST. STATE PARK IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS NEAR BOTH OF ARE ACTUALLY- BORDERS BOTH OF OUR AREAS. AND IT'S REALLY A UTILIZED I BELIEVE- BY LOTS OF PEOPLE I MEAN IT'S HUGE IT IN A LOTS OF PEOPLE CAN BE ALLEN I THINK. YOUR GOAL OF ACCESS WOULD BE MORE. APPROPRIATELY ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU YOU KNOW PROVIDED PROGRAMS AND FUNDING AT TO ACTUALLY GET. KIDS AND- CAL INTO THOSE AREAS- ALSO COMMENTED WAS IT. YOU KNOW GETTING KIDS TO ENJOY THE COASTAL AREAS WELL THERE AND THAT IN OUR- THEY'RE ACTUALLY CLOSER TO THE COAST AND THEY ARE TO ANSWERING THE STATE PARK SO. THERE'S BEEN SOME CIRCULAR REASONING ON THE ACCESS AND. THIS IS BRIAN FROM YOUR NOSE PLEASE WELL MY GLASSES KEEP FALLING UP SO I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING A TAILOR SO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT MR CHAIR. I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP A BALANCE HERE BUT IF I CAN'T SEE I CAN'T READ MY NOTES AND THEN I HAVE TO MAKE THINGS UP AS I GO. YOU'RE DOING PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SIR. IF CLOSER. FELICIANO COULD DO YOU COULD DO IT. THE WE WOULD CALIFORNIA'S PUTS ITS OWN CAL OFTEN FOR ITS OWN SPIN ON THINGS AND YOU'VE DECIDED TO MAKE THIS AN ACCESS BILL I AGREE WAS SENT AWAY SO THAT THERE JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY IT'S ABOUT A GOAL OF THE BILL THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S ACTUALLY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT MAKES IT DEAL WITH ACCESS. AND IT'S WELL INTENTIONED BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME CIRCULAR REASONING AND YOU WANNA PROTECT AREAS AND CLOSE THEM. AND THEN YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS SO HOW DOES PROTECTING LAND WATER. AND OCEAN IN THIS BILL EXPAND ACCESS HOUSE AT A CHEAP IN THIS BILL. ARE THESE LANDS GOING TO BE TURNED INTO PARKS WELL THE WATERS YOU PROTECT IN THE OCEAN SUDDENLY TURN INTO PLACES. AT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE EASY ACCESS TO. HOW DO YOU ENVISION THIS WORKING AND I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU A PERSONAL STORY. I RECENTLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TAKE UP- SPORT FISHING OFF THE COAST OF SAN DIEGO. AND I WAS ON A ON A BOAT THAT HAPPENED TO- ACCIDENTALLY MOVE INTO THE PRESERVE OFF OF LAHORE YEAH- THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT- YOU KNOW MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE AND- ALTHOUGH. WE HAD ENGAGEMENT WITH SOME OF A CALIFORNIA'S PROFESSION ON FORSMAN OFF THERE'S UP. TO CAL. WELL IF YOU. IF YOUR CALL THESE OFF. AT NOT IF ANY THAT'S MY ACCESS IT'S A PRETTY. WE HAD ACCESS TO IT BECAUSE IT'S OPEN THERE'S NO FENCE THERE'S NO MARKERS AND WE ACCIDENTALLY MOVED INTO AND WE COULD HAVE HAD A YOU KNOW AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION- BUT FORTUNATELY IT WORKED OUT AND WE GOT IT WORKED OUT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BUT THERE'S DIDN'T HEAR CLOSING ACCESS YOU'RE NOT MAKING IT MORE ACCESSIBLE. MISTER VICE CHAIR OF WITH THE AUTHOR BE WILLING TO ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES- AND YOU WANT TO COME IN IT IS IT'S A SUPER BRIEF RESPONSE PAGE TEN OF THE NOW CISCO'S OVER EVEN FURTHER AMENDMENTS IN REGARDS TO IMPROVING ACCESS AND PROTECTING. PROTECTING LAND IS NOT BEING CLOSING IT OFF I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT CLOSING OFF ACCESS I HAD AN YOU CAN PROTECT BIODIVERSITY AND ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME TIME WITH YOUR FISHING HIKING. CAMPING ABSOLUTELY CONSISTENT ONE. THANK YOU NEXT IN ORDER SENATOR JACKSON AND I WOULD ASK MEMBERS TO PLEASE COME BACK TO FORTY TWO OH THREE. SO THIS IS BEEN A FASCINATING DISCUSSION I HAVE NOW READ THIS BILL BACK AND FORTH SEVERAL TIMES WE'VE BEEN HERE BECAUSE THERE IS AND HAS BEEN. REAL CONCERN EXPRESSED THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS REALLY GOING TO UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF OUR SPORT FISHERMEN TO FISH AND PEOPLE TO HIKE IN AND I'M LOOKING TO SEE WHERE IN THE BILL THAT COULD BE. INTERPRETED AS SUCH AND REALLY THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE IS JUST AN INHERENT DISTRUST. THIS BILL IS PURELY ASPIRATIONAL AND I'M REMINDED ON THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS THAT WERE ALSO PURELY ASPIRATIONAL BACK- I THINK PROBABLY IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND WE WANTED TO BECOME- USING. NON FOSSIL FUELS I THINK BILL THE CALL FOR THAT IT DIDN'T SAY HOW WE WERE GOING TO DO IT. IT JUST SAID THIS IS OUR GOAL IN FACT WE REACH THAT 20% FORTY BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING HOW DID OUR 30%OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I BELIEVE. BY THE FORTY HOUR PASHA LEGISLATION TO FIFTEEN ARE AND THEN IT ALSO DIDN'T TELL US HOW TO DO IT JUST THAT WE NEEDED TO DO IT IT HAD SOME GUIDELINES BUT THERE WAS REALLY NOT NO PRESCRIPTIVE. METHODOLOGY OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT THAT WAS USED. IT I'VE HAD PROBABLY MORE RESPONSE FROM MY LOCAL COMMUNITY ON THIS BILL THAN ANY OTHER BILL THIS YEAR AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE PASSION OF MY SPORT FISHER. INDUSTRY AND IN SANTA BARBARA I HAVE VERY DIFFERENT WHO ARE. PASSIONATE ABOUT SPORTS FISHING AND I'VE DONE IT IS WELL I'M NOT BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT- BUT I HAVE TRIED AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATED AS A VERY EXCITING SPORT IF YOU'RE ABLE TO LAND ANYTHING- BUT I'VE WATCHED PEOPLE DO IT. AND IT REALLY DOES TAKE A TALENTED AND AN INTENSITY OF COMMITMENT SO I DON'T WANT TO IN ANY WAY DOWNPLAY. THEIR CONCERNS EXCEPT TO SAY THERE REALLY. I THINK BASED UPON THE UNKNOWN. LAURENTIIS DEPENDING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE AT THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE CALLING FOR. I DON'T THINK IT CALLS FOR MUCH OTHER THAN A COMMITMENT TO SEEING THAT THIS HAPPENED AND SO- AND THEN I SHOULD I WANT TO. HELLO MY SHOW TO THE OF THE REMARKS MADE BY OUR CHAIR THERE ARE SOME REAL LEGITIMATE CONCERNS HERE- AGAIN WHEN WE TRY SOMETHING NEW OR THAT SON KNOWN AND ISN'T AS CLEAR AS PEOPLE WANTED TO BE- THAT THIRD THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS BUT I THINK. THE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL OF THIS 30% OF MANDATE IS A GOOD ONE- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCES I HAPPEN TO HAVE. A FAMILY THAT COMES FROM NEW FROM LAND. AND SO WE VISITED THE NEW FEES- MANY YEARS AGO YOU KNOW NEW FROM LAND USED TO BE A ROBUST COD FISHING AREA- EACH EVERYWHERE YOU WENT THERE WAS CARD THIS CARD THA AND NOW THE COD FISHERMEN LEAST AS OF A FEW YEARS AGO WERE ALLOWED TO. TWO DAYS OF FISHING A YEAR AND A TOTAL OF I THINK FOR CARD. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO TERRIBLY OVER FISH THERE NO CARDS LEFT. NO PART OF IT FRANKLY WAS IT WAS OVERFISHED BY OTHER COUNTRIES. THAT HAD COME IN AND SO IT WOULD BE MY HOPE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER. THAT ARE JURISDICTION ONLY GOES OUT THREE MILES AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE AS I UNDERSTAND IT A SUBSTANTIAL STOCK OF FISH AT THIS POINT TIME. BUT THAT CAN GO VERY QUICKLY AS I RECALL OUR FRIENDS IN NEWFOUNDLAND- EXPERIENCING THAT ALL NOW FRANKLY ON THEIR SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A LIVELIHOOD- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE. I GREW UP IN NEW ENGLAND MANY YEARS AGO THEY WERE LOOSE THERE WAS A AN ABSENCE OF LOBSTER STOCK. AND SO THEY LITERALLY CUT OFF LOBSTER FISHING. OR TRAPPING. FOR FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND NOW THEY HAVE A ROBUST STOCK SO MY SENSE IS THAT WE CAN DO THIS RIGHT. AND THAT IS IN ALL OF OUR BEST INTEREST TO DO IT RIGHT. SO WITH THAT- I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD ASPIRATION- BUT I DO ANTICIPATE. AT THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE RELINQUISHING OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THESE ISSUES WILL COME BACK BEFORE US. BUT THE HOPE IS TO GET EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET TO THAT THIRTY PERCENT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I'M A WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON. I JUST WANT TO OFFER A FEW COMMENTS AND THEN RETURN TO THE AUTHOR- FOR HIS CLOTHES. SEVERAL HAVE COMMENTED THAT WHAT'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN THIS IN COVERT NINETEEN I ACTUALLY SEE A VERY STRONG NEXUS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE VECTORS THAT HAVE LED O THE CORONA VIRUS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS THE IMPACT OF HUMAN. CONDUCT IMPACTING NATURAL HABITATS IMPACTING THE BIODIVERSITY AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY. THE VECTORS THAT LED TO THE CORONA VIRUS THAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH TODAY. MAY NOT BE UNIQUE TO A SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE- OUR ACTIONS AS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE MUDDIED THE DIVIDE BETWEEN NATURAL HABITAT AND HUMAN POPULATION HUMAN EXPLOITATION OF RESOURCES. I SEE THIS VERY. VERY STRONGLY CONNECTED IN THE OTHER NEXUS IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WHAT BRINGS THIS TO THE FORE IS A CLIMATE CRISIS THAT AFFECTS ALL HUMANITY AND AFFECTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND IT'S NOT PROST BECTIVE IT'S HAPPENING TODAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY READ LAST WEEK IN BAGHDAD IT WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DEGREES. HEATS IN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR SURPASS PAST RECORDS FOR THE DAYS OVER A HUNDRED DEGREES. ALSO SIR AND I'M REMINDED A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE IN CALIFORNIA. HI THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS UPON US. AND IT WILL NOT PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS BETWEEN POOR COMMUNITIES BETWEEN WEALTHY. BETWEEN FISHING COMMUNITIES BETWEEN HUNTING COMMUNITIES SO AS I THINK HAS BEEN OFFERED AN ACKNOWLEDGED BY MANY OF THE OPPONENTS WE ALL SHARE A CONCERN FOR TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN AND MUST DO AS HUMANS UNDO THE IMPACTS CREATED BY HUMANS. I SEE THIS BILL AS A CRITICALLY URGENT REMINDER. OF THE CRISIS NOT A PROSPECTIVE CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IN EXISTING CURRENT CRISIS THAT TO PROTECT FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN THE ABILITY TO HUNT THE ABILITY TO FISH THE ABILITY TO SURF THE ABILITY TO DO DIVING- ALL OF THE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT WE ENJOY- REQUIRE US ALL TO PULL TOGETHER. AND IN A MEASURED. SMART COLLABORATIVE MANNER IDENTIFY HOW WE PROTECT OPEN LAND HOW WE PROTECT OPEN OCEAN WATERS AND WE SET A STANDARD AND A MODEL WORKING WITH NOT ONLY OTHER STATES BUT OTHER NATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SHARED COMMITMENT TO THESE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS IF WE'RE TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN ANYWAY AND ULTIMATELY. THIS IS ALL A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. BURGLAR WE SOMETIMES. TALK. SPECIES CAN LEAD TO THE EXTINCTION OF HUMANKIND. SO I SEE A VERY. PRESIDENT URGENCY TO MOVING THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD AND I WOULD ALSO JOIN IN JUST HOPING THOSE WHO OPPOSED SO VEHEMENTLY TODAY AND I THANK THEM FOR THEIR CONCERN AND PARTICIPATION.
