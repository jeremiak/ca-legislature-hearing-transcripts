WITH HARMFUL CHEMICALS. TO

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:39.850
EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE

CHEMICALS AND WHAT THEY MIGHT

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.054
EFFECTIVE MIGHT HAVE ON HUMANS.

HAPPENS. TO IT- IT IS SOME OF

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:53.831
THESE TESTS INVOLVE

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:55.966
INTENTIONALLY OVERDOSING- THESE

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:59.937
ANIMALS- LONG TERM- HORRIFIC

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:02.039
PAIN INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE-

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:04.475
JUST TO SEE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN-

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.711
ANIMALS ARE OBSERVED. TO SEE IF

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:07.445
A BOMB AT TO SEE IF THEY

00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:09.346
BELIEVE. MAY BE PLEASE ENTER

AFTER DAY. SEE IF IT DEVELOP

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.786
TUMORS AND SEE IF DIE- THIS IS

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:17.254
THESE DOGS AND CATS SUFFER

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.322
GREATLY FROM THIS TOXICITY

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.257
TESTING. AND WE NOW KNOW FROM

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:21.759
INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT THESE

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:22.760
TESTS ARE REALLY NOT THAT

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:24.628
HELPFUL. IN TERMS OF PREDICTING

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:28.999
IMPACTS. ON THE HUMAN BODY. BUT

00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.301
CONTINUED TO PERFORM THESE

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.036
TASKS AND CONTINUES TO USE

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.004
THESE ANIMALS- SOMETIMES IT

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:35.873
APPEARS BY FORCE OF HABIT.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.608
WE'RE JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:39.744
WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN- DRUG

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:40.778
DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH IN

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:41.645
PARTICULAR BECAUSE I KNOW

00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:43.447
YOU'VE ALL HEARD FROM- FROM THE

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:45.950
DRUG INDUSTRY- SHOWS THAT

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:46.951
ANIMAL MODELS ARE POOR

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:49.120
PREDICTORS FOR DRUG SAFETY IN

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:50.621
HUMANS. AND KEEP IN MIND THIS

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.223
IS TO ABOUT TOXICITY TESTING

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.824
ABOUT SAFETY THAT'S A POOR

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:56.494
PREDICTOR 90% OF DRUG DRUGS

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.628
THAT ARE FIRST TESTED ON

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:59.830
ANIMALS. ULTIMATELY FAIL WHEN

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:02.133
THEY ARE TESTED OR WARRANTY IN

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:04.335
HUMANS SUBSEQUENTLY-

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:06.537
RESEARCHERS HAVE EVEN EQUATED

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:08.806
PREDICTIONS OF TOXICITY- BASED

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:11.008
ON CANINE DATA. TO BE ONLY

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.777
SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN TOSSING A

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:15.679
COIN. IN ADDITION- THE TESTING

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.314
PROCESS LACKS TRANSPARENCY AND

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:18.949
ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S OFTEN

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.484
CONDUCTED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:22.353
AND PRIVATE LIVES THAT ARE NOT

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:25.189
REQUIRED TO REPORT WHAT TESTS

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:29.994
THEY ARE CONDUCTING OR WHY. ARE

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.095
ONE YOUR PESTICIDE TESTS AS I

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:33.130
MENTIONED BEFORE SPEED FOR A

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:35.166
YEAR ALL THE DOGS ARE KILLED AT

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:36.634
THE END OF THE STUDY IF THEY DO

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.335
NOT DIE DURING THE STUDY. THE

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:40.971
EPA ELIMINATED THIS TEST

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:42.206
REQUIREMENT MORE THAN A DECADE

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:44.074
AGO IT'S NO LONGER REQUIRED

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.442
THERE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:47.378
CARRY IT OUT. CALIFORNIA HAS

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.746
BEEN A LEADER IN ALTERNATIVE

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.648
TESTING METHODS TO REPLACE

00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:52.016
ANIMAL TESTING WITH NEW

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.418
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY- AND

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.320
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:59.023
OF THIS- THE WORK OF COMPANIES

00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.757
IN CALIFORNIA DEVELOPING

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:01.725
ALTERNATIVES. TO ANIMAL TESTING

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:03.427
IS IMPRESSIVE WE SHOULD BE

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:06.163
ENCOURAGING THE SHIFT. INSTEAD

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.165
OF EMPOWERING A VERY

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:12.269

CARRIED OUT ON DOGS AND CATS

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:17.875
THAT SERVE O REGULATORY

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.643
REQUIREMENTS. IF THERE IS A

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.946
REGULATORY REQUIREMENT. FROM

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:23.080
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR FROM

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.682
THE STATE THEN THAT'S EXEMPT

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:25.349
FROM THIS BILL WE'RE NOT

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.518

CURRENTLY BUILT THE BILL

00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:54.811
REQUIRES OUR MEMBERS TO GET

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.813

SUCH TESTING. WE ABSOLUTELY

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:16.266
AGREE WITH A LOT OF GOALS OF SB

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:19.336
OUR MEMBERS OF STAFF CORPORATE

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:20.937

DOGS OR CATS IN ONLY ONE HALF

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.379
OF 1% FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH AND

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.715
TEACHING IN OUR STATE. AND THIS

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:32.449
PERCENTAGE CONTINUES TO

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:35.085

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:42.826
SPECIES ARE BEST FOR DRUG

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:44.528
ACTUALLY THE NUMBER FOR DOGS

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:46.429
AND CATS CONTINUE TO DECLINE.

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:47.464
OUR MEMBERS ARE ENGAGED

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:48.832
IDENTIFYING REAL RESEARCH

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:51.067
ALTERNATIVES BUT THE SCIENCE

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:53.870
JUST ISN'T THERE YET. ALL CLOSE

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:54.471
BY UNDERSCORING RATHER SHARED

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:56.406
COMMON GROUND. THE BILL WAS

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:57.674
AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR TESTING

00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:59.843
SPECIFIC TO ANASTASIA CANCER

TREATMENT ANIMAL VACCINES AND

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:03.747
OTHER ANIMAL MEDICINES. WE

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.282
APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT SUCH

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:08.051

00:53:10.086 --> 00:53:11.321
SIMPLY WE ASK THAT THIS

00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:13.189
RECOGNITION IS APPLIED BROADLY

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:14.858
IN ORDER TO AVOID HAVING TO

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.993
PICK WHICH DISEASE FALLS INTO

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.296
THE CATEGORY OF BAD ENOUGH. HAS

THE NEXT POTENTIAL DRUG TO COME

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.303
TO MARKET THAT IN THE VERY

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:28.305
LEAST WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF BUT

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:29.372
HOPEFULLY EVEN BETTER SAVE

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:31.474

FEDEX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN

THE NEXT WE HAVE MORE A TOP. I

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:47.290
THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:48.625
TIME WHERE A TOP ARE HERE ON

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.594
BEHALF OF BIO CALM CALIFORNIA

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.762
AND WE TOO ARE HERE REGRETTABLY

00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:54.965
IN A POSITION OF OPPOSING LAST

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.933
AMENDED. AND JUSTIN MENTIONED-

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.868
PHARMACOLOGICAL TESTING ON CATS

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.203
AND DOGS IS NOT SOMETHING OUR

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.205
COMPANIES DO CAPRICIOUSLY OR

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.040
OUT OF CONVENIENCE. IN FACT

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:05.942
QUITE THE OPPOSITE. HOWEVER

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.277
THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:09.279
THERE ARE MULTITUDES OF NON

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:11.648
ANIMAL BASED TASKS THAT CAN BE

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.650
SUBSTITUTED IN ALL CASES. THIS

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:16.286
IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. THE FDA

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:18.989
EXPECTS ANIMAL MODELS SINCE.

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:20.857
MANY TIMES NOTHING CAN REPLACE

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.892
THE WHOLE LIVING SYSTEM WHEN

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:25.729
DEVELOPING DRUGS ENGAGING DRUG

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:26.930
EFFICACY AND SAFETY. OUR

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.565
COMPANIES USE CATS AND DOGS

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:30.467
SPARINGLY AND ONLY WHEN

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:33.436
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. 95% OF

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:34.738
ESSENTIAL ANIMAL WORK IS

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:37.474
CONDUCTED ON RODENTS AND ONLY

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.377
ONE HALF OF 1% OF SUCH WORKS

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:40.944
WORK TAKES PLACE ON CATS AND

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:43.913
DOGS. BUT WHEN SCIENCE DICTATES

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.515
THE NEED FOR USE OF NON RODENT

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:48.485
SPECIES ARE COMPANIES ARE BOUND

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:49.019
TO FOLLOW THOSE SCIENTIFIC

00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:51.454
PRINCIPLES. WE TWO ARE MOST

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:52.689
APPRECIATIVE OF THE TIME THE

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:54.090
AUTHOR HAS SPENT IN DISCUSSIONS

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:56.292
WITH US ON THE BILL. RECENT

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:58.294
AMENDMENTS ARE A GOOD START.

00:54:58.361 --> 00:54:59.663
WELL THEY PURPORT TO EXEMPT

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:01.464
MEDICAL RESEARCH THE LANGUAGE

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.400
REQUIRES A WRITTEN MANDATE FROM

00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:06.102
THE FTA. THAT IS NOT HOW THE

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:12.776
FDA OPERATES. THE FDA. ONLY

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:14.678
ONCE THE COMPLETED STUDIES ARE

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:17.080
PRESENTED TO THEM. THIS BILL

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:18.682
THE BILL- RECOGNIZES THIS

00:55:18.748 --> 00:55:20.016
INCONSISTENCY BECAUSE IT

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:21.985
PROVIDES A FULL EXEMPTION FOR

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:24.087
VACCINE DEVELOPMENT. WELL WE

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.089
CERTAINLY AGREE THAT VACCINE

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:26.856
DEVELOPMENT IS CRITICAL

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.725
ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR WE MUST

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:29.859
ENSURE THAT THERAPIES FOR

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.828
CANCER AND ALZHEIMER'S FOR NON

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:34.097
OPIOID PAIN RELIEF OPTIONS AND

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.565
FOR ALL OTHER CRITICAL HUMAN

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:37.500
HEALTH CONDITIONS RECEIVE THAT

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.803
SAME EXCLUSION. THE AMENDMENT

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:40.737
WE SEE COULD NOT PROVIDE A

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.338
LOOPHOLE FOR INAPPROPRIATE

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:45.508
ANIMAL TESTING. BUT IS INSTEAD

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.142
A RESPONSIBLE AND SCIENCE BASED

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:48.478
SOLUTIONS. AND LASTLY I WOULD

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:49.746
KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ENJOY SOME

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:50.747
OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:53.149
PROTECTIONS IN THE NATION FOR

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:53.683
ANIMALS USED IN SCIENTIFIC

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.518
RESEARCH. OUR COMPANIES ARE

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.020
PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THE

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.588
MAJORITY OF AVAILABLE DOGS ARE

00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:00.924
ADOPTED TO FOREVER HOMES IN

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.491
CALIFORNIA WHEN RESEARCHERS

CALIFORNIA ARE NOT MUTUALLY

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:09.299

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:15.358

00:58:17.927 --> 00:58:20.296
IT'S LIKE A MYSTICAL. BLACK BOX

AND THEY HAVE TO SORT OF THE

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:25.235
DIVINER INTO IT I THINK THE

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:29.439

IN THEIR LETTER AN AMENDMENT

MY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.117
IS DIFFERENT IN THE SENATE AND

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:22.751
THE ASSEMBLY AS WE DON'T HAVE A

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.686
PORTFOLIO TO MY STAFF IS

01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:25.888
CONTINUE TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.623
TO GIVE ME MY MATERIAL IN THIS

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:29.458
WAS A PDF THAT WE TRIED IN THE

SIX TO BETTER PROTECT SURVIVORS

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:37.566
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WELL AS

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:38.667
YOU KNOW CURRENTLY IF SOMEONE

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.235

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:41.403

RELINQUISH THEIR GUNS- BUT

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:45.874
THERE IS NO PROCESS FOR THAT TO

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:49.311
OCCUR. SO THIS CREATES A TIP-

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.914
DID TO FIX SENATE RULE FIVE

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.181

FIRE ARMS ARE REMOVED- THIS

01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.421
BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:00.822
COURT COMMUNICATE WITH LOCAL

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.691
LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT FAILURES

TO RELINQUISH THESE WEAPONS WE

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.961

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:07.062
RECENTLY A POLICE OFFICER WAS

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:08.664

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.432
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHERE GUNS

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:13.702
WERE ON SITE- WE KNOW THAT THE

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:14.836
PRESENCE OF A FIREARM INTO.

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.605
HOME INCREASES THE RISK OF

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:19.041
HOMICIDE BY 5100% AND WE KNOW

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:20.309
THAT WOMEN AND SPECIALLY WOMEN

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.777
OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:25.213

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.348
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. EVEN WITH

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.350
THE STATE. LAWS WE STILL KNOW

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.952
THAT THERE ARE OVER TWENTY

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.119
THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:31.954

01:59:50.082 --> 01:59:52.618
HUSBAND. THOSE ARE VERY REAL

01:59:52.685 --> 01:59:56.589
CASES. I KNOW THAT IN THE FIVE

01:59:56.656 --> 01:59:57.023
YEARS SINCE THIS WAS

01:59:57.089 --> 02:00:00.059
IMPLEMENTED TWENTY EIGHT

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:00.593
HUNDRED HAVE ASKED FOR THE

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.995
PRESCRIPTION EIGHTEEN HUNDRED

02:00:03.062 --> 02:00:07.300
HAVE ACTUALLY INGESTED IT. THE

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:09.635
TESTIMONY GIVEN TODAY ALSO IS

02:00:09.702 --> 02:00:13.406
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ON A

02:00:13.472 --> 02:00:15.541
PERSONAL NOTE TO MAKE SURE THIS

02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:18.711
WITH THE SENATOR MY FATHER WAS

02:00:18.778 --> 02:00:22.014
DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER

02:00:22.081 --> 02:00:24.917
WAS GIVEN SIX TO LIVE. THE SIX

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.552
WEEKS WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:28.854
TO THE FAMILY I RECOGNIZE THAT

02:00:28.921 --> 02:00:29.855
NOT EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME

02:00:29.922 --> 02:00:33.159
WAY AND SOME MAY WANT TO MAKE

02:00:33.225 --> 02:00:33.759
THE DECISION NOT TO HAVE TO GO

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:40.132
THROUGH THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING

02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:42.902
THAT I HOPE WILL BE ADDRESSED

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:44.737
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ANYONE TO

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:47.473
HAVE PHYSICAL PAIN. DURING

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:51.377
THEIR END OF LIFE PERIOD. THERE

02:00:51.444 --> 02:00:54.180
WAS ANECDOTAL TESTIMONY. AND I

02:00:54.246 --> 02:00:55.681
STAY ON A TOTAL BECAUSE THERE

02:00:55.748 --> 02:00:57.550
IS NOTHING IN THE DATA THAT IS

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:58.484
COLLECTED AT THAT WOULD TELL

02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:01.587
US. THAT FROM THE TIME THAT

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:05.324
SOMEBODY FIRST REQUESTED. THE

02:01:05.391 --> 02:01:07.526
TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS TO

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:08.794
THE TIME THREE DECISIONS IS

02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:10.596
MADE THAT THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY

02:01:10.663 --> 02:01:12.765
WE DON'T HAVE THERE'S NO DATA

02:01:12.832 --> 02:01:13.265
THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:18.004
REGARDING THAT. MY GREATEST

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:21.207
CONCERN WITH THE BILL. THREE

02:01:21.273 --> 02:01:25.411
THINGS. REDUCING THE TIME

02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:27.279
PERIOD TO MAKE THIS DECISION

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:32.785
FROM TWO WEEKS DOWN TO TWO DAYS.

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:34.520
REMOVING THE SUNSET ALL

02:01:34.587 --> 02:01:37.023
TOGETHER AND I RECOGNIZE THAT-

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:39.592
YOUR YOUR TIME. HERE IN THE

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:41.427
LEGISLATURE IS LIMITED BUT

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:42.662
THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:44.563
SUPPORTED THIS THAT I THINK.

02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:46.899
HAVING THE SUNSET EXTENDED I

02:01:46.966 --> 02:01:48.000
THINK WOULD PROVIDE THEM AN

02:01:48.067 --> 02:01:49.869
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THIS UP

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:53.406
AGAIN. THE OTHER IS THE REMOVAL

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.141
OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR MENTAL

02:01:55.207 --> 02:01:57.977
EVALUATION OR PSYCH PSYCHIATRIC

02:01:58.044 --> 02:02:02.148
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION. TODAY

02:02:02.214 --> 02:02:03.683
HAPPENS TO BE MY FATHER'S

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:06.452
BIRTHDAY. THAT WE CELEBRATE IN

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:08.621
A DIFFERENT WAY. BUT I THINK

02:02:08.688 --> 02:02:14.727
THE. THE SAFEGUARDS PROVIDED IN

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:19.198
YOUR INITIAL BILL. AB X. TO

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:20.599
FIFTEEN I THINK PROVIDE US

02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:22.568
ENOUGH OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:24.670
THOSE WHO WANT TO AVAIL

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:33.045
THEMSELVES OF. OF THIS OPTION.

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:35.448
TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AND IN FACT

02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:36.015
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:39.118
DONE IT. IN THE FIVE YEARS

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:41.454
SINCE THIS WAS FIRST PASSED. I

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:43.856
DO WANT TO SEE MORE INFORMATION

02:02:43.923 --> 02:02:46.258
I DO WANT TO DATE THE

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:48.260
SPECIFICALLY FROM THE TIME IT

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:49.795
IS FIRST REQUESTED TO THE TIME

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:52.932
IT THIS THIS LEAD TIME THAT HAS

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:55.301
BEEN TESTIFIED TO. I'D LIKE TO

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:57.803
KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT. FOUR I

02:02:57.870 --> 02:03:01.006
COMPLETELY VOTE TO DO AWAY WITH

02:03:01.073 --> 02:03:05.044
THE SUNSET. AND IT IS FOR THOSE

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:07.947
REASONS THAT TODAY RIGHT. WILL

02:03:08.013 --> 02:03:08.514
BE WILL BE LAYING OFF ON THE

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:14.620
BILL. THANK YOU THIS GONZALEZ.

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:18.924
THANK YOU- AGAIN EIGHT EIGHT

02:03:18.991 --> 02:03:21.761
ECHO- MY COLLEAGUES. DISCUSSION

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:23.629
ABOUT HOW MUCH WE RESPECT YOU

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:24.363
KNOW AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:25.564
CLEAR BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:26.565
IMPORTANT TO SAY AND I KNOW

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:28.567
THAT WE'VE HAD SO MANY

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:30.302
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS-

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:32.171
PROBABLY COULD CHARGE ME FOR

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:34.140
THERAPY AFTER THE MANY YEARS

02:03:34.206 --> 02:03:35.875
WE'VE DISCUSSES. LIKE MY

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:37.810
COLLEAGUE- I WATCHED MY MOM

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:41.714
DIED OF CANCER AND- IN FIVE

02:03:41.781 --> 02:03:43.949
DAYS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER.

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:48.020
SEVENTY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY- IT

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:49.088
WAS QUITE AWHILE AGO SHE SHE

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:52.024
PASSED AWAY AND I ALSO HAVE

02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:54.960
SUCH DEEP EMPATHY- FOR THE

02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:56.095
COLORS WHO TALKED ABOUT THE

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:57.897
PAIN AND WITNESSING LOVED ONES

02:03:57.963 --> 02:03:59.532
AND WHAT THEY GO THROUGH ON AND

02:03:59.598 --> 02:04:01.233
I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO DO A

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:05.738
BETTER JOB OF- HELPING PEOPLE.

02:04:05.805 --> 02:04:08.474
BELIEVE EIGHT THEIR PAIN. I

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:09.642
DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE INITIAL

02:04:09.708 --> 02:04:15.548
BILL AND WHEN THIS- CAME ABOUT.

02:04:15.614 --> 02:04:21.887
A- I. THOUGHT I HAVE TO BE

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:22.488
HONEST AND TAKE A SECOND LOOK

02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:24.623
AT THIS. BUT I AM ALSO

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:26.292
CONCERNED THAT WE'RE CHANGING

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:27.860
THE WAIT PERIOD AND GETTING RID

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:30.329
OF THE SUNSET- I THINK THOSE

02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:32.298
TWO THINGS TOGETHER DON'T MAKE

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:35.334
A LOT OF SENSE TO ME- I HAVE

02:04:35.401 --> 02:04:36.769
SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS

02:04:36.836 --> 02:04:38.737
OPPOSED TO DEAL AND- PEOPLE

02:04:38.804 --> 02:04:41.907
WHO- WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IT DID

02:04:41.974 --> 02:04:45.144
THEY DIE- AND NOT TAKE THE

02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:47.646
MEDICATION OR- ARE THEY STILL

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:50.916
LIVE- I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:53.018
SEE MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT

02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:54.420
PEOPLE'S LIFE EXPENSE

02:04:54.486 --> 02:04:56.555
EXPECTANCY IN WHAT THEY'RE TOLD

02:04:56.622 --> 02:04:58.357
AND HOW LONG THEY LIVE I HAVE A

02:04:58.424 --> 02:04:59.825
BEEN VERY OPEN SHE'S BEEN OPEN

02:04:59.892 --> 02:05:01.827
SIGN I WILL SAVE A DISTRICT

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:02.494
DIRECTOR WHO IS BATTLING NOW

02:05:02.561 --> 02:05:04.530
STAGE FOR LUNG CANCER THAT HAS

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:06.398
SPREAD TO HER BRAIN AND BONES

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:08.634
AND- YOU KNOW WE JUST PASSED

02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:09.969
THE TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY AND

02:05:10.035 --> 02:05:12.805
SHE WAS. SHE WERE QUALIFIED

02:05:12.872 --> 02:05:15.908
FOR- THIS DRUG WHEN SHE WAS

02:05:15.975 --> 02:05:20.012
INITIALLY- DIAGNOSED SO. I ALSO

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:21.080
HAVE CONCERNS AND WILL CONTINUE

02:05:21.146 --> 02:05:24.583
HAVE CONCERNS- FOR INDIVIDUALS.

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:26.785
ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T REACHED THE

02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:28.888
UNDERSERVED YET WHO MAY SEE

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.456
THIS IS NOT A CHOICE BECAUSE WE

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:34.193
DON'T. PROVIDE ADEQUATE HEALTH

02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:37.096
CARE FREE HEALTH CARE AND-

02:05:37.162 --> 02:05:38.397
THERE IS A VERY REAL

02:05:38.464 --> 02:05:40.566
POSSIBILITY AS THIS EXPANDS

02:05:40.633 --> 02:05:44.870
WITH US. KATHLEEN THE VERY-

02:05:44.937 --> 02:05:46.772
WHAT I FIND IMPORTANT ASPECT OF

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:48.007
SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTH

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.808
CARE FOR PEOPLE TO BE GIVEN A

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:51.877
FALSE CHOICE. A CHOICE OF

02:05:51.944 --> 02:05:53.946
BURNING THEIR FAMILY WITH WITH

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:56.548
MEDICAL BILLS- EXTENSIVE

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:58.884
MEDICAL BILLS OR OF CUTTING

02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:00.819
SHORT THEIR LAST DAYS WITH

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.821
THEIR FAMILY AND I WORRY ABOUT

02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:05.758
THAT- BECAUSE WE'VE ALL SEEN

02:06:05.824 --> 02:06:07.860
PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS THAT. ARE

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:10.162
RATIONAL DECISIONS EVEN IF YOU

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:11.897
WILL FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND I

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:13.999
THINK IT UNTIL WE CAN GET TO A

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:16.869
POINT WHERE INDIVIDUALS TRULY

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:18.804
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE A

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:21.307
DECISION. NOT BASED ON- A

02:06:21.373 --> 02:06:23.609
FAULTY MEDICAL SYSTEM THAT

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:24.910
WOULD THAT WOULD CURRENTLY

02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:26.812
HAVE- THAT I CANNOT SUPPORT

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:29.481
THIS BILL BUT I DO WANT TO

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:31.116
THANK YOU FOR. I KNOW THIS ALL

02:06:31.183 --> 02:06:33.085
SOUNDS STRANGE BUT CONTINUING

02:06:33.152 --> 02:06:38.857
TO CHALLENGE ME- I THINK AT.

02:06:38.924 --> 02:06:41.894
WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU BELIEVE

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:43.729
IS RIGHT I JUST WISH WE HAD

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:45.931
MORE INFORMATION AND THAT WE

02:06:45.998 --> 02:06:48.467
WEREN'T DOING BOTH THE SUNSET-

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:50.602
ELIMINATION AND A CHANGE IN THE

02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:53.105
POLICY AT THE SAME TIME- BUT I

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:55.074
CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.509
YOU. BUT THE QUESTIONS ARE

02:06:57.576 --> 02:07:03.248
COMMON. RIGHT SENATOR I WANT TO

02:07:03.315 --> 02:07:04.783
THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.719
TO THE ISSUE AND I KNOW IT WAS

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.954
ON HOW TO WORK A NUMBER OF

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:09.555
YEARS AGO TO GET THE ORIGINAL

02:07:09.621 --> 02:07:13.659
BILL PASSED AND IT IS HARD.

02:07:13.726 --> 02:07:15.327
THIS IS ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY.

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:16.528
AND THAT'S WHY IT IS SO

02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:18.630
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE RE

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:21.166
VISITING US AT THIS POINT. AND

02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:24.503
CASE IN POINT. WILL FORCE AND

02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:27.272
MANY OTHERS WE KNEW GOING IN

02:07:27.339 --> 02:07:29.875
THAT MANY WOULD. CONTEMPLATE

02:07:29.942 --> 02:07:31.910
THE OPTION BUT NOT TAKE THE

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:33.679
OPTION AND THAT'S WITH THE

02:07:33.746 --> 02:07:35.347
DIGNITY COMES IN IS WHEN

02:07:35.414 --> 02:07:36.982
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING THROUGH

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:39.785
THE PROCESS OF DYING. AND CAN

02:07:39.852 --> 02:07:42.688
DO SOMETHING TO TAKE CONTROL

02:07:42.755 --> 02:07:44.656
THEMSELVES AND WHETHER NOT THE

02:07:44.723 --> 02:07:45.924
EXERCISE THAT CONTROL JUST

02:07:45.991 --> 02:07:48.160
HAVING THAT OPTION IS FOR THE

02:07:48.227 --> 02:07:50.095
DIGNITY COMES IN BECAUSE

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:52.031
THERE'S SO MANY OTHER FACTORS

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:54.333
THAT ARE AT PLAY WHEN SOMEONE

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.068
IS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

02:07:56.135 --> 02:07:57.803
DYING THIS IS JUST THAT.

02:07:57.870 --> 02:08:00.672
MODICUM OF CONTROL FOR THAT

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:02.574
INDIVIDUAL AND THAT'S WHY. IS A

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:03.842
VERY IMPORTANT BILL FOR THE

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:05.177
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.378
THIS ALSO IS A VERY IMPORTANT

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:07.679
ILL. FOR THE STATE OF

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:09.081
CALIFORNIA AS WE HAVE LEARNED

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:12.618
OVER FIVE YEARS. THAT A LOT OF

02:08:12.684 --> 02:08:15.721
THE FEARS THAT LED TO THE

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:18.223
COMPROMISES THAT YOU TOOK. I

02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:20.092
HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN REALIZED

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:20.993
EITHER A LOT OF OTHER THINGS

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:23.228
GOING ON AND WORRIES ABOUT THE

WAGE THAT SO- AND I KNOW THAT

02:47:03.313 --> 02:47:06.483
OVER. A PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE

02:47:06.549 --> 02:47:08.585
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY

02:47:08.651 --> 02:47:10.153
AGGRESSIVE IN ADDRESSING THIS

02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:12.555
ISSUE IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF TE

02:47:12.622 --> 02:47:14.457
MARKET PLACE AND I THINK WE

02:47:14.524 --> 02:47:17.160
RIGHTEOUSLY SO- I WANTED TO ASK

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:20.397
YOU A QUESTION AROUND THIS

02:47:20.463 --> 02:47:21.598
ALTERNATIVE TO THE SAFE HARBOR-

02:47:21.664 --> 02:47:24.000
BECAUSE I THINK. IT I DON'T

02:47:24.067 --> 02:47:26.169
EVEN IF YOU'RE WILLING THIS

02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:28.371
ACCEPT THIS AMENDMENT I'M NOT

02:47:28.438 --> 02:47:30.306
SURE I'VE HEARD FROM. THE

02:47:30.373 --> 02:47:31.541
OPPOSITION THAT THEY WOULD

02:47:31.608 --> 02:47:34.110
REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION- I'D BE

02:47:34.177 --> 02:47:34.911
INTERESTED TO KNOW IF THEY

02:47:34.978 --> 02:47:37.313
WOULD. BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.649
BECAUSE THE DIVISION OF LABOR

02:47:39.716 --> 02:47:41.885
STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. DOES

02:47:41.951 --> 02:47:46.756
SEEM LIKE A- APPROPRIATE AREA

02:47:46.823 --> 02:47:48.992
OR AGENCY TO BILLY KIND OF GET

02:47:49.058 --> 02:47:51.795
IN THERE AND- AND MAYBE DO A

02:47:51.861 --> 02:47:55.865
VERY THOROUGH. AND THOUGHTFUL

02:47:55.932 --> 02:47:58.067
INVESTIGATION OF THESE RECORDS

02:47:58.134 --> 02:47:59.068
ARE TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK

02:47:59.135 --> 02:48:01.838
WITH. SOME CLEAR VIOLATIONS OF

02:48:01.905 --> 02:48:04.140
ANY- AND SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS

02:48:04.207 --> 02:48:07.510
AS TO. WHETHER YOU THOUGHT IF

02:48:07.577 --> 02:48:09.379
THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:11.281
APPROACH AS AN ALTERNATIVE

02:48:11.347 --> 02:48:12.782
WHICH YOU ALREADY HAVE IN THE

02:48:12.849 --> 02:48:15.385
BILL- WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE

02:48:15.452 --> 02:48:17.153
ON. THAT WHICH YOU THINK THIS

02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:19.122
DOES OR DOESN'T DO AS A AS A

02:48:19.189 --> 02:48:20.757
PROPRIA MEHMET TO THE BILL

02:48:20.824 --> 02:48:22.025
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

02:48:22.091 --> 02:48:24.260
MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION SO I

02:48:24.327 --> 02:48:25.361
THINK THAT PEOPLE GET VERY

02:48:25.428 --> 02:48:26.863
ENAMORED WHEN THEY HEAR A

02:48:26.930 --> 02:48:29.299
BUSINESS THEY WILL PAY FOR IT-

02:48:29.365 --> 02:48:32.836
AND WIND- WE LOOK AT D. LOC AS

02:48:32.902 --> 02:48:34.571
WHERE THEY WOULD HOUSE THIS.

02:48:34.637 --> 02:48:36.139
DEAL AS HE DOES THIS NOT HAVE

02:48:36.206 --> 02:48:38.508
THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT AND IF

02:48:38.575 --> 02:48:40.543
THE CORPORATION IF THESE IF BE

02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:42.212
A IS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT THEY

02:48:42.278 --> 02:48:43.913
CAN HIRE A COMPANY THEY KIND OF

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:45.181
HURT A COMPANY YEARS AGO THEY

02:48:45.248 --> 02:48:47.183
CAN HIRE A COMPANY TODAY. THAT

02:48:47.250 --> 02:48:49.352
DOES THE AUDITING FOR THEM. I

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:50.887
PERSONALLY SEE THIS AS A STALL

02:48:50.954 --> 02:48:52.789
TACTIC BECAUSE IF WE PUT IT

02:48:52.856 --> 02:48:54.891
INTO THE GOVERNMENT TO DO WE

02:48:54.958 --> 02:48:55.825
ALL KNOW GOVERNMENT MOVES

02:48:55.892 --> 02:48:57.494
SLOWLY I WISH THAT IT DID NOT

02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.162
BUT IT DOES BUT THIS IS GOING

02:48:59.229 --> 02:48:59.629
TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW

02:48:59.696 --> 02:49:01.865
DEPARTMENT. WE REACHED OUT TO

02:49:01.931 --> 02:49:02.765
DELISTING WE HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD

02:49:02.832 --> 02:49:04.734
BACK FROM THEM SO IF THEY CAN'T

02:49:04.801 --> 02:49:06.736
EVEN RETURN OUR CALL ABOUT THIS

02:49:06.803 --> 02:49:08.171
IT MAKES ME WONDER IF THEY

02:49:08.238 --> 02:49:09.572
WOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ENACT

02:49:09.639 --> 02:49:11.941
THIS PROGRAM. AND TO ASSEMBLY

02:49:12.008 --> 02:49:14.511
WOMAN RAISES POINT SEVENTEEN NO

02:49:14.577 --> 02:49:16.880
ONE WENT A LONG WAY IN HELPING

02:49:16.946 --> 02:49:18.481
WITH WAGE THEFT BUT IT DIDN'T

02:49:18.548 --> 02:49:20.617
GO ALL THE WAY UNTIL WE MAKE

02:49:20.683 --> 02:49:23.520
SURE THAT NO WORKER. LOSES PAY

02:49:23.586 --> 02:49:26.923
ON NO CONTRACTOR- THINKS OF-

02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:28.825
WAGE THEFT AS A COST OF DOING

02:49:28.892 --> 02:49:30.493
BUSINESS WE HAVEN'T DONE OUR

02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:33.129
JOB WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH BE A

02:49:33.196 --> 02:49:34.197
MANY TIMES WE'VE LISTENED TO

02:49:34.264 --> 02:49:37.100
ALL OF THEIR CONCERNS. YOU KNOW

02:49:37.166 --> 02:49:39.002
MR FOR OUR SAID THAT THEY HAVE

02:49:39.068 --> 02:49:40.670
OFFERED MEANINGFUL AMENDMENTS

02:49:40.737 --> 02:49:42.005
WELL I KNOW THAT THEY THINK

02:49:42.071 --> 02:49:43.239
THEY'RE MEANINGFUL ANYONE IN

02:49:43.306 --> 02:49:44.274
OPPOSITION WHO OFFERS

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:45.508
AMENDMENTS THINK SERMON

02:49:45.575 --> 02:49:47.410
AMENDMENTS ARE MEANINGFUL SO I

02:49:47.477 --> 02:49:48.811
DON'T DISAGREE WITH HIM ON THAT

02:49:48.878 --> 02:49:50.380
POINT. WE JUST DON'T THINK THE

02:49:50.446 --> 02:49:52.415
AMENDMENTS ENHANCE THE BILL WE

02:49:52.482 --> 02:49:56.419
THINK IN. SOME POINTS IT EVEN

02:49:56.486 --> 02:49:58.488
HURTS THE BILL. I THANK YOU.

02:49:58.555 --> 02:50:00.957
THOSE OUT. YEAH THANK YOU

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:04.227
SENATOR- SO SOMEONE WHO

02:50:04.294 --> 02:50:08.665
SUPPORTED SEVENTEEN NO. ONE-

02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:11.901
YOU KNOW I. AND THE WHOLE AT

02:50:11.968 --> 02:50:13.603
THE CONCEPT AS I REMEMBER IT

02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:15.371
BACK THEN I MEAN THAT WAS A FEW

02:50:15.438 --> 02:50:17.140
YEARS AGO BUT THE CONCEPT WAS

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:20.577
HAVE BEEN GENERAL HAS A JOB IN

02:50:20.643 --> 02:50:21.110
THE SUB CAN'T CONTRACT IT

02:50:21.177 --> 02:50:22.345
DOESN'T DO IT LET'S HAVE.

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:23.780
LIABILITY THERE BECAUSE SINCE

02:50:23.846 --> 02:50:25.949
IT'S THE WHOLE PROJECT THEY'RE

02:50:26.015 --> 02:50:30.053
THE ONE OVERSEEN RIGHT- BUT THE

02:50:30.119 --> 02:50:31.287
DEAL WAS AND I THINK IT'S

02:50:31.354 --> 02:50:32.188
ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT BUT

02:50:32.255 --> 02:50:33.957
THE DEAL WAS IS THAT WE'RE NOT

02:50:34.023 --> 02:50:35.792
HAVING PENALTIES ASSOCIATED

02:50:35.858 --> 02:50:36.326
WITH THAT GENERAL BECAUSE

02:50:36.392 --> 02:50:38.161
THEY'RE NOT THE ONE WHO. DID

02:50:38.227 --> 02:50:39.195
THAT IT WAS THE SUB WHO

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:40.496
ACTUALLY DID THAT AND AS WE

02:50:40.563 --> 02:50:41.898
FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT WE HAD

02:50:41.965 --> 02:50:43.166
LEGISLATION TO CLEAN THAT UP

02:50:43.232 --> 02:50:46.336
THE NEXT YEAR BY. MR THURMAN'S.

02:50:46.402 --> 02:50:47.704
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS KIND OF

02:50:47.770 --> 02:50:49.372
GOING BACK ON. WHAT THAT

02:50:49.439 --> 02:50:52.041
PRINCIPLE WAS. AS I UNDERSTAND

02:50:52.108 --> 02:50:53.610
IT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE CASE

02:50:53.676 --> 02:50:55.511
WHERE WE HAD. WHERE SEVENTEEN

02:50:55.578 --> 02:50:58.247
NO ONE. WAS USED TO ENSURE THAT

02:50:58.314 --> 02:51:00.883
SOMEONE. WAS PAID. SO IT'S NOT

02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:02.418
LIKE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THESE

02:51:02.485 --> 02:51:05.955
TYPE OF CASES OUT THERE- AND

02:51:06.022 --> 02:51:07.290
AGAIN I THINK THAT THE LAW IS

02:51:07.357 --> 02:51:08.758
WORKING I THINK THE OTHER

02:51:08.825 --> 02:51:12.762
THINGS THAT WE HAVE A PLACE-

02:51:12.829 --> 02:51:13.296
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND

02:51:13.363 --> 02:51:16.032
OTHERS. OUR ENFORCEABLE AND ARE

02:51:16.099 --> 02:51:17.300
A RESULT IN ENSURING THAT

02:51:17.367 --> 02:51:19.869
WORKERS GET PAID SO. I JUST

02:51:19.936 --> 02:51:21.104
DON'T SEE THE NEED AND NOT LOOK

02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:23.406
UP IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCEPT OF

02:51:23.473 --> 02:51:24.707
I THINK THERE ARE CASES WHERE

02:51:24.774 --> 02:51:26.643
GENERAL'S NEED TO BE LIABLE FOR

02:51:26.709 --> 02:51:27.777
THE FACT THAT THIS DOESN'T

02:51:27.844 --> 02:51:29.445
HAPPEN. BUT WE START THROWING

02:51:29.512 --> 02:51:30.847
IN PENALTIES THAT USUALLY

02:51:30.913 --> 02:51:33.049
ASSOCIATE WITH AN INTENTIONAL

02:51:33.116 --> 02:51:36.753
NONPAYMENT OF- OF WAGES WHICH

02:51:36.819 --> 02:51:38.621
IN THIS CASE IS A SUB. IT IS

02:51:38.688 --> 02:51:40.723
DONE THAT NOT THE GENERAL SO I

02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:42.025
JUST I FEEL LIKE HAVING PEOPLE

02:51:42.091 --> 02:51:43.459
ALMOST LIKE A PAYMENT PUNITIVE

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:46.129
DAMAGES PENALTIES. ON SOMEONE

02:51:46.195 --> 02:51:48.398
WHO WASN'T THE DIRECT THAT

02:51:48.464 --> 02:51:51.801
ACTOR JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

02:51:51.868 --> 02:51:52.435
THE RIGHT APPROACH TO THE AND I

02:51:52.502 --> 02:51:54.537
MEAN. SO I WOULD JUST RESPOND

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:55.638
WITH THIS IS SOMEONE WHO

02:51:55.705 --> 02:51:57.740
NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS FOR MANY

02:51:57.807 --> 02:51:59.409
YEARS BEFORE I RAN FOR OFFICE.

02:51:59.475 --> 02:52:01.344
WITHOUT A PENALTY IT'S JUST A

02:52:01.411 --> 02:52:03.479
SUGGESTION SEVENTEEN NO ONE IS

02:52:03.546 --> 02:52:05.214
A SUGGESTION THERE IT WITHOUT

02:52:05.281 --> 02:52:07.116
AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WITH

02:52:07.183 --> 02:52:09.318
THE PENALTY THEN WHAT HAPPENS

02:52:09.385 --> 02:52:11.054
WHEN THE CONTRACTOR DOESN'T PAY

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:12.221
WHEN THE SUB DOESN'T PAY WHAT

02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:13.956
HAPPENS THEN TO THE WORKER.

02:52:14.023 --> 02:52:15.958
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SUFFER AND

02:52:16.025 --> 02:52:18.027
IF YOU DO IT RIGHT AND IF YOU

02:52:18.094 --> 02:52:20.396
DON'T AND YOU ABIDE BY THE LAW

02:52:20.463 --> 02:52:21.197
THEN THE PENALTY IS NOT A

02:52:21.264 --> 02:52:22.999
PROBLEM. AND I MEAN IF YOU

02:52:23.066 --> 02:52:24.400
WOULD LIKE I CAN ASK- MY

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:26.402
WITNESS TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:27.170
SEVENTEEN A ONE TO GO SHE

02:52:27.236 --> 02:52:29.105
ASIANS BUT- THIS IS A DIFFERENT

02:52:29.172 --> 02:52:30.907
BILL. IT'S A DIFFERENT AUTHOR

02:52:30.973 --> 02:52:32.041
IT'S GOING TO A DIFFERENT

02:52:32.108 --> 02:52:34.110
GOVERNOR IF SEVENTEEN OH ONE

02:52:34.177 --> 02:52:35.478
WERE WORKING IN ITS ENTIRETY

02:52:35.545 --> 02:52:36.913
THIS BILL WOULDN'T BE NEEDED.

02:52:36.979 --> 02:52:40.283
BUT IT ISN'T SO THAT'S WHY

02:52:40.349 --> 02:52:41.350
SEVEN TWO SEVEN IS NEEDED. BUT

02:52:41.417 --> 02:52:43.286
DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE IDEA

02:52:43.352 --> 02:52:45.221
IS THAT IF THEY DON'T GET PAID

02:52:45.288 --> 02:52:48.291
IN THE GENERAL. IS LIABLE AND

02:52:48.357 --> 02:52:48.891
YOU CAN ACTUALLY COLLECT FROM

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:50.960
THAT GENERAL. THE UNPAID WAGES

02:52:51.027 --> 02:52:52.995
THAT WASN'T SO SEVENTEEN OH ONE

02:52:53.062 --> 02:52:54.397
IS NOT A SUGGESTION IT'S A

02:52:54.464 --> 02:52:58.901
LEGALLY BINDING LAW. THAT PUTS

02:52:58.968 --> 02:53:00.002
THEM ON THE HOOK AND- AT LEAST

02:53:00.069 --> 02:53:01.471
RIGHT NOW THE ONLY WE ONLY HAVE

02:53:01.537 --> 02:53:03.706
ONE DOCUMENTED CASE WHERE THIS

02:53:03.773 --> 02:53:05.775
HAPPENED AND THEY DID PAY THEM.

02:53:05.842 --> 02:53:07.310
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE

02:53:07.376 --> 02:53:08.745
DOCUMENTED CASE WE HAVE A-

02:53:08.811 --> 02:53:10.346
REPORT THAT SAYS IS ABOUT FORTY

02:53:10.413 --> 02:53:13.182
PERCENT. OF WORKERS WHO- HOW

02:53:13.249 --> 02:53:14.317
ARE THEIR WAGES HAVE BEEN

02:53:14.383 --> 02:53:16.652
STOLEN SO THAT I DON'T THINK

02:53:16.719 --> 02:53:18.821
THAT THAT IS JUST ONE CASE. AND

02:53:18.888 --> 02:53:20.723
IF YOU HAVE THERE ARE CASES

02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:21.924
WHAT. HAVE THEY BROUGHT CASES

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:23.526
US AND TRY TO RECOVER FROM THE

02:53:23.593 --> 02:53:25.394
GENERAL FUND. IT AND IF THEY

02:53:25.461 --> 02:53:27.196
DON'T IF THE GENERAL DOESN'T

02:53:27.263 --> 02:53:28.331
HERE HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART

02:53:28.397 --> 02:53:30.266
ABOUT SEVEN TO SEVEN VERSUS

02:53:30.333 --> 02:53:31.834
SEVENTEEN OH ONE. IF THEY ARE

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:35.371
NOT PAID. THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO

02:53:35.438 --> 02:53:36.038
THE GENERAL NOTHING. THERE'S NO

02:53:36.105 --> 02:53:37.206
PENALTY FOR NOT PAYING YOUR

02:53:37.273 --> 02:53:39.008
WORKERS THERE'S NO PENALTY

02:53:39.075 --> 02:53:40.843
NOTHING HAPPENS. BUT THE WORKER

02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:43.012
DOESN'T GET PAID HE'S THE ONE

02:53:43.079 --> 02:53:44.013
OR SHE'S THE ONE WHO CAN'T PAY

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:45.047
THEIR BILLS I GUESS THAT'S WHY

02:53:45.114 --> 02:53:46.716
I'M CONFUSED. MY UNDERSTAND IS

02:53:46.783 --> 02:53:48.217
THAT YES THEY DO GET PAID

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:49.685
BECAUSE THEY THEY SEE THE

02:53:49.752 --> 02:53:50.887
GENERAL THE GENERAL HAS TO PAY

02:53:50.953 --> 02:53:52.755
THEM. IF THEY ARE NOT THAT

02:53:52.822 --> 02:53:54.323
GENERAL GETS PENALIZED ENOUGH

02:53:54.390 --> 02:53:55.792
TO PAY ADDITIONAL PENALTIES AND

02:53:55.858 --> 02:53:57.627
DAMAGES THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S

02:53:57.693 --> 02:54:00.463
YOUR BILL. RIGHT BUT TO SAY

02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:01.497
THAT THEY DON'T GET PAID THAT'S

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:03.699
NOT TRUE. IT IS TRUE I WOULDN'T

02:54:03.766 --> 02:54:04.767
BE DOING THE BILL FOR BECAUSE

02:54:04.834 --> 02:54:05.768
WE'RE GETTING PAID IF WAGE

02:54:05.835 --> 02:54:07.136
THEFT WASN'T OCCURRING I

02:54:07.203 --> 02:54:08.037
WOULDN'T BE DOING TO FILL SO.

02:54:08.104 --> 02:54:09.205
YOU'RE TELLING ME IS RIGHT NOW

02:54:09.272 --> 02:54:10.840
IF SOMEONE COMES AND SAYS HEY I

02:54:10.907 --> 02:54:13.075
DIDN'T GET PAID BY MYSELF. AND

02:54:13.142 --> 02:54:14.477
SUIT IS WHAT JOINED SEVERAL

02:54:14.544 --> 02:54:17.713
pTHE GENERAL. AND THEY PROVE

02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:19.649
THEY WEREN'T PAID. THE GENERAL

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:21.751
WILL BE ORDERED TO PAY THOSE

02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:23.719
WAGES SO I'M THE WORKER. AND I

02:54:23.786 --> 02:54:25.454
DON'T GET PAID. SO I HAVE TO GO

02:54:25.521 --> 02:54:27.190
GET AN ATTORNEY AND I HAVE TO

02:54:27.256 --> 02:54:28.724
SUE THE GENERAL WHAT HAPPENS

02:54:28.791 --> 02:54:29.792
ALL MY BILLS DURING THAT TIME

02:54:29.859 --> 02:54:31.360
WHO PAYS MY RENT WHO PAYS MY

02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:32.995
HOUSE PAYMENT. WHO PAYS FOR

02:54:33.062 --> 02:54:34.530
CHILD CARE WHO PAYS FOR FOOD.

02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:38.768
SUING SOMEONE. IS NOT THE

02:54:38.835 --> 02:54:41.103
REMEDY. I MEAN YOU CAN DO IT

02:54:41.170 --> 02:54:42.939
FOR SURE I MEAN IT IS A REMEDY

02:54:43.005 --> 02:54:44.307

IN FACT A REMEDY IT IS A REMEDY

02:54:48.377 --> 02:54:49.912
IS. NOT A VIOLENT REMEDY THAT'S

02:54:49.979 --> 02:54:51.914
USED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE.

02:54:51.981 --> 02:54:53.316
RECOVER DAMAGES WHEN THEY'RE

02:54:53.382 --> 02:54:54.750
NOT. WHEN SOMEONE BREACHES OF

02:54:54.817 --> 02:54:56.319

THAT AND MAYBE THE GENERAL

02:55:26.649 --> 02:55:28.417
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW BUT STILL IT

02:55:28.484 --> 02:55:30.086
WAS THEIR JOB IT WAS THIS

02:55:30.152 --> 02:55:32.154
OVERALL PROJECT. SO IT MAKES

02:55:32.221 --> 02:55:34.090
SENSE TO SAY LOOK YOU MAKE SURE

ON TOP OF THAT. TO ME THAT

02:55:48.905 --> 02:55:50.039

JUST HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL

02:55:55.711 --> 02:55:57.346

PREFERABLE BECAUSE IT IS

03:22:12.320 --> 03:22:13.988
CHEAPER THAN A NUMBER OF.

EIGHT YEARS THAT WE'VE SERVED

TOGETHER OFF AND ON ABOUT WHAT

03:23:50.351 --> 03:23:51.085
WE'RE DOING TO CALIFORNIA

03:23:51.152 --> 03:23:53.187
CORPORATIONS I MIGHT BE MORE

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:54.989
OPEN TO SUGGESTING STREAMLINING

03:23:55.056 --> 03:23:56.390
THE MOVING OUT OF CALIFORNIA

THANK YOU THIS MAIENSCHEIN YEAH

03:24:01.495 --> 03:24:05.499
COUPLE COMMENTS- AND A QUESTION.

03:24:05.566 --> 03:24:07.468
FIRST UP TO SOME EXOTIC THIS IT

03:24:07.535 --> 03:24:09.403
APPEARS AT LEAST TO BE KIND OF

03:24:09.470 --> 03:24:11.305
A- SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A

03:24:11.372 --> 03:24:14.442
PROBLEM. THERE'S NO- STUDIES

03:24:14.508 --> 03:24:15.910
THAT SHOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE

03:24:15.977 --> 03:24:17.878
INTERESTINGLY THE ONLY. SUPPORT

03:24:17.945 --> 03:24:20.815
I SEE FOR THIS IS- A DIVISION

03:24:20.881 --> 03:24:21.582
OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS

03:24:21.649 --> 03:24:22.984
ASSOCIATION THERE'S NO BUSINESS

03:24:23.050 --> 03:24:25.620
GROUPS WHO WERE- SAYING THIS IS

03:24:25.686 --> 03:24:27.054
AN ISSUE I CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN

03:24:27.121 --> 03:24:28.990
CONSULTED BY ANY. BUSINESSES

03:24:29.056 --> 03:24:32.059
WHO. I SAID THIS IS A PROBLEM

03:24:32.126 --> 03:24:33.394
OR THEY WON'T INCORPORATING

03:24:33.461 --> 03:24:36.964
CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE UNDER. A

03:24:37.031 --> 03:24:40.167
CERTAIN OPERATING STATUS THEY

03:24:40.234 --> 03:24:41.769
COULDN'T SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE

03:24:41.836 --> 03:24:46.140
SWITCH- I AM SURPRISED THAT

03:24:46.207 --> 03:24:47.908
THIS IS EVEN PROCEEDED TO THIS

03:24:47.975 --> 03:24:50.578
POINT WITHOUT ANY SORT OF.

03:24:50.645 --> 03:24:52.880
REALLY FACTUAL BASIS TO SUPPORT

03:24:52.947 --> 03:24:56.083

MY COLLEAGUE SAID- YOU KNOW. IT

03:25:00.087 --> 03:25:02.390
IT'S A- HARD POSITION IN MY

03:25:02.456 --> 03:25:04.759
OPINION TO BE TRYING TO MAKE IT

03:25:04.825 --> 03:25:06.594
SIMPLER FOR A CORPORATION TO

03:25:06.661 --> 03:25:09.463
LEAVE CALIFORNIA- IN ADDITION

03:25:09.530 --> 03:25:11.532
WHAT IS THE FEE. THAT THEY

03:25:11.599 --> 03:25:14.468
WOULD BE SAVING. WELL I THINK

03:25:14.535 --> 03:25:15.936
THAT DEPENDS ON IF THERE'S A

03:25:16.003 --> 03:25:18.205
SPECIFIC NUMBER THAT I YES TO

03:25:18.272 --> 03:25:20.441
ME BASED ON HOW HOW LONG THE

03:25:20.508 --> 03:25:21.542
TOURNEY TAKES TO DO THE

03:25:21.609 --> 03:25:22.743

HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT THAT'S NOT

03:26:22.470 --> 03:26:24.038
WHERE THE COST SAVINGS COMES

03:26:24.105 --> 03:26:27.374
FROM THE COST SAVINGS RESULTS

MAKES INCORPORATING CALIFORNIA

03:26:38.986 --> 03:26:42.189
LESS EXPENSIVE. OKAY SO EVEN

A MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS

03:28:05.005 --> 03:28:06.140

03:28:06.207 --> 03:28:08.509
CORPORATIONS LEAVING CALIFORNIA

STATE. THIS IS ALL ABOUT

03:28:17.151 --> 03:28:18.652

03:28:24.091 --> 03:28:26.227
SIMPLE PROCESS AND WE MADE IT

03:28:26.293 --> 03:28:28.095
VERY EASY FOR A PARTNERSHIP FOR

03:28:28.162 --> 03:28:30.598

DO THE SAME THING FOR

03:28:39.273 --> 03:28:41.575

04:40:37.287 --> 04:40:39.689
ISSUES THAT TO MY COLLEAGUE

04:40:39.756 --> 04:40:41.291
FROM SAN DIEGO BROUGHT UP- I

04:40:41.357 --> 04:40:42.825
WOULD AGREE WITH IS. THAT I

04:40:42.892 --> 04:40:43.593
THINK WE ALL WANT TO

04:40:47.330 --> 04:40:52.402
JUST ABOUT ENSURING THAT- YEAH

04:40:52.468 --> 04:40:53.436
I MEAN I LIKE IT WE GOT ALL

04:40:53.503 --> 04:40:54.571
THESE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE IT

04:40:54.637 --> 04:40:56.039
RIGHT ALL THESE OTHER STATES

04:40:56.105 --> 04:40:57.240
THAT HAVE A DECERTIFICATION

04:40:57.307 --> 04:40:58.808
PROCESS WHERE WE JUST LIKE

04:40:58.875 --> 04:41:01.077
ALMOST COPYING. WHAT THESE

04:41:01.144 --> 04:41:02.712
OTHER STATES HAVE DONE BECAUSE

04:41:02.779 --> 04:41:03.279
THEY'VE DEALT WITH THE SAME

04:41:03.346 --> 04:41:05.215
EXACT ISSUES. THEY WERE ALL

04:41:05.281 --> 04:41:06.916
TALKING ABOUT. BUT IT SEEMS

04:41:06.983 --> 04:41:08.618
LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A

04:41:08.685 --> 04:41:13.323
WHOLE NEW- TOTALLY NEW PROCESS

04:41:13.389 --> 04:41:15.925
THAT'S DIFFERENT AND THAT AND

04:41:15.992 --> 04:41:19.495

04:41:19.562 --> 04:41:20.563
YOU KNOW KIND OF TWO FOLD ARE

04:41:20.630 --> 04:41:22.232
YOU KNOW THE CONFLICTS OF

KHOBAR. I THINK THERE'S ALSO

04:41:24.701 --> 04:41:27.437
CONFLICTS WITH ENSURING A FAIR

04:41:27.503 --> 04:41:31.374
TRIBUNAL ON THE APPEAL PROCESS-

04:41:31.441 --> 04:41:32.242
YEAH I MEAN ONE THING I THOUGHT

04:41:32.308 --> 04:41:33.276
ABOUT JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT

04:41:33.343 --> 04:41:34.777
THAT SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF WHY

04:41:34.844 --> 04:41:36.946
NOT HAVING LIKE RETIRED JUDGES

04:41:37.013 --> 04:41:40.149

04:41:43.219 --> 04:41:45.555
AREA YOU KNOW JUST TRYING TO

04:41:45.622 --> 04:41:46.189
ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE KIND OF

04:41:46.256 --> 04:41:51.261
MORE NEUTRAL. ARBITERS TO MAKE

04:41:51.327 --> 04:41:51.728
THIS DETERMINATION OF

04:41:51.794 --> 04:41:53.830
DECERTIFICATION- RATHER THAN

04:41:53.896 --> 04:41:55.198
THESE LIKE SEVEN APPOINTEES

04:41:55.265 --> 04:41:56.766
WHICH I THINK IS THE CURRENT

04:41:56.833 --> 04:42:01.037
MAKE UP OF THE OF THE BILL- YES

04:42:01.104 --> 04:42:02.572

DIG IN OUR HEELS IN A LITTLE

04:42:11.214 --> 04:42:15.285
BIT. AND I FEEL LIKE- THERE'S

04:42:15.351 --> 04:42:16.886
THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET

04:42:16.953 --> 04:42:17.453
SOMETHING THROUGH HERE THAT

04:42:17.520 --> 04:42:19.589
WOULD BE THAT WOULD. ENSURE

04:42:19.656 --> 04:42:20.690

04:43:28.224 --> 04:43:31.160
COMPLICATED AND- WOVEN.

04:43:31.227 --> 04:43:33.262

CERTAINLY A BILL AS IT RELATES

04:43:49.212 --> 04:43:51.447
TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE FOCUS

04:43:51.514 --> 04:43:53.282
OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE BAY

MAKE THAT PART CLARIFIED AND

04:44:06.863 --> 04:44:09.799
STRONGER- I DO BELIEVE THAT-

04:44:09.866 --> 04:44:11.567
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

04:44:11.634 --> 04:44:13.302
CHALLENGING BILLS BECAUSE YOU

04:44:13.369 --> 04:44:14.437
HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT PIECES

04:44:14.504 --> 04:44:16.606
OF IT. HOUSED IN SO MANY

04:44:16.672 --> 04:44:17.774
DIFFERENT COMMITTEES THAT

04:44:17.840 --> 04:44:21.911
REQUIRE A LOT OF- DIGGING INTO

04:44:21.978 --> 04:44:22.879
THE ELEMENTS THAT YOU'VE

04:44:22.945 --> 04:44:24.914
ALREADY ARTICULATED IN YOUR

04:44:24.981 --> 04:44:27.550

04:44:35.425 --> 04:44:36.793
OF GOING OVER THIS IN THE SENSE

04:44:36.859 --> 04:44:38.094
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE

04:44:38.161 --> 04:44:40.263
MAGNITUDE OF SOMEHOW HOW

04:44:40.329 --> 04:44:42.732
CARRYING THESE TYPE OF BILLS-

04:44:42.799 --> 04:44:45.034
ART. ARE CHALLENGING BECAUSE

04:44:45.101 --> 04:44:49.305
YOU'RE TRYING. TO MAKE THIS

04:44:49.372 --> 04:44:51.340
ELEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT-

04:44:51.407 --> 04:44:55.278

04:44:57.513 --> 04:44:58.614
COMMITTEE STRUCTURES AND THINGS

THAT ACTUALLY WILL BE PASSED

04:45:00.983 --> 04:45:02.952
OUT MORE IN DETAIL AND PUBLIC

04:45:03.019 --> 04:45:05.421
SAFETY. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE

04:45:05.488 --> 04:45:07.690
ADMINISTRATION IS ENGAGE WITH

04:45:07.757 --> 04:45:10.526

ONE WITH ADMINISTRATION. HAS

04:45:15.431 --> 04:45:19.035
EYES ON IT AS WELL- AND I THINK

04:45:19.101 --> 04:45:19.569
FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS

04:45:19.635 --> 04:45:21.537

WHICH WAS TAKEN OUT-

04:45:36.285 --> 04:45:39.222
APPROPRIATELY SO BECAUSE THIS

04:45:39.288 --> 04:45:41.123
BILL IS SORT OF BEEN WORKING

04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:43.092
ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AND

04:45:43.159 --> 04:45:45.561
IT MAKES SENSE RATHER THAN HAVE

04:45:55.671 --> 04:45:57.473
NOT JUST DEALT WITH THE LOCAL

04:45:57.540 --> 04:45:59.742
LEVEL AS IT RELATES TO- HOW A

04:45:59.809 --> 04:46:01.777
PERSON WAS THEN AN OFFICER WAS

04:46:01.844 --> 04:46:04.714

PROBABLY BE ANSWERED AND STILL

04:46:33.776 --> 04:46:35.177
CONCERNS THEY CAN PROBABLY

04:46:35.244 --> 04:46:38.481

ARTICULATED BY A COUPLE OF THE

04:46:50.326 --> 04:46:52.328

MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LITIGATION

04:51:15.724 --> 04:51:17.393
THAT COULD COME OUT OF THIS.

04:51:17.459 --> 04:51:19.094

04:51:19.161 --> 04:51:21.764
ANYBODY WELL- IF THIS ENDS UP

04:51:21.831 --> 04:51:23.599
JUST BEING SWALLOWED UP IN A

HERE IS SOME. REAL SUPPORT TO

04:55:47.262 --> 04:55:48.797
DEFEAT CATION ESPECIALLY WILL

BE GOT THE BAD ACTORS OUT THERE

04:55:50.299 --> 04:55:51.900

04:55:51.967 --> 04:55:53.402
CONCERN IS THIS BOARD THIS

04:55:53.469 --> 04:55:55.370
COMMITTEE- IT IT'S SO IMPORTANT

04:55:55.437 --> 04:55:56.939
THAT WE DO IT THE RIGHT WAY

04:55:57.005 --> 04:55:58.340
AND- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE

04:55:58.407 --> 04:56:00.209
YOU'RE AT WHEN YOU HAVE.

04:56:00.275 --> 04:56:01.877
MEMBERS THAT ARE APPOINTED YOU

04:56:01.944 --> 04:56:03.145
CAN SOMETIMES GO ONE WAY OR THE

04:56:03.212 --> 04:56:04.847
OTHER. AND SO I THINK THAT'S

04:56:04.913 --> 04:56:06.815
REALLY REALLY- YOU KNOW

04:56:06.882 --> 04:56:08.717
CRITICAL THAT WE THAT WE HAVE A

04:56:08.784 --> 04:56:09.885
CLEAR PROCESS OF TRANSPARENCY

04:56:09.952 --> 04:56:11.253
PROCESS. AND THAT THERE'S A

04:56:11.320 --> 04:56:12.955
BALANCE THERE SO THAT WHEN

04:56:13.021 --> 04:56:14.256
THESE THINGS GO DOWN WHEN THEY

04:56:14.323 --> 04:56:16.225
DO HAVE JUDGMENTS. PEOPLE CAN

04:56:16.291 --> 04:56:17.126
FEEL LIKE THERE WAS JUSTICE AND

04:56:17.192 --> 04:56:18.994
IT WAS FAIR- FROM BEGINNING TO

04:56:19.061 --> 04:56:20.762
THE END SO. AT THAT POINT

04:56:20.829 --> 04:56:22.197
BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS SO

04:56:22.264 --> 04:56:24.266

04:56:36.678 --> 04:56:37.679
FAIR AND BALANCED COMMITTEE

04:56:37.746 --> 04:56:40.649

YEAH FOR THIS COMMITTEE WE

04:57:11.847 --> 04:57:13.081
REALLY TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF

04:57:13.148 --> 04:57:15.617
THE BAY ENACT. I'M AFRAID

04:57:15.684 --> 04:57:19.888
MOVING FORWARD IN. I UNDERSTAND

04:57:19.955 --> 04:57:24.193
THE POLITICS BUT- THE- ADDING

04:57:24.259 --> 04:57:26.662
CONFUSION TO AN UNDERMINING THE

04:57:26.728 --> 04:57:28.130
BANE ACT IS SOMETHING THAT I

04:57:28.197 --> 04:57:29.565

STILL MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD.

04:57:37.706 --> 04:57:40.142
IT WOULD BE. VERY BAD FOR THIS

LEGISLATURE TO NOT MOVE

04:57:41.543 --> 04:57:43.145

MAKE THE BEST PROGRESS THAT WE-

04:57:44.880 --> 04:57:46.148
POSSIBLY CAN AND I THINK WE'LL

04:57:46.215 --> 04:57:47.549
FIND THE SKY IS NOT FALLING

04:57:47.616 --> 04:57:49.885
THAT THAT THESE ARE APPROPRIATE

04:57:49.952 --> 04:57:52.654

05:52:20.118 --> 05:52:22.521
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY LAW

05:52:22.588 --> 05:52:24.690
ENFORCEMENT'S FEAR THAT THERE

INFORMATION FOR- FOR THE PUBLIC

05:52:54.553 --> 05:52:56.088
