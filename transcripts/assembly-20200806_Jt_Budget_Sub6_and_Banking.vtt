00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:28.405
ALL I WANTED TO SAY THAT I

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:29.640
STRONGLY SUPPORT THE I THINK

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.175
THIS IS RIGHT PART WHAT. WITH

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:34.078
OUR BANK THE CHAPLAIN NIGHT AS

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:39.183
A SORT OF ACCIDENT OF GEOGRAPHY

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.384
AND AGE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.853
THE OF THIS. THAT WERE INVOLVED.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.722
IN ABOUT AGENCY. AND IT'S A

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:45.756
REALLY GOOD WORK THAT IT DID IN

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.057
ITS EARLIER SINCE I. REALLY

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:48.292
BELIEVE THAT HAVING STRONG

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.693
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS HAVING A

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.494
STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:52.563
AGENCY HERE IN THE STATE OF

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:53.263
CALIFORNIA. IT IS REALLY

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.832
IMPORTANT I REGRET IN SOME WAYS

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:55.899
THAT IT BECAME A PARTISAN ISSUE

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:57.301
IN WASHINGTON DC I DON'T THINK

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:58.402
THE CONSUMER PROTECTION SHOULD

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.570
BE A PARTISAN ISSUE I DON'T

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:01.038
THINK THAT. PROTECTING FOLKS

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:02.406
FROM PROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:03.440
OR DECEPTIVE BUSINESS

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:05.376
PRACTICES. SHOULD BE SOMETHING

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:06.443
IT SHOULD BE A- CAUSE FOR

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.811
DISAGREEMENT I THINK THAT KIND

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.480
OF THING THAT. DEMOCRATS AND

00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:11.315
REPUBLICANS DO. SO CAN BE AS-

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:14.251
AS- THIS. I DID WANT. REALLY A

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.919
PART OF IT COMMITTEE CHAIR FOR.

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:18.589
INTRODUCING BASED ON THE SIZE.

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:25.596
OF GETTING. PROCESS CONCERTS

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:27.498
HERE- YOU KNOW I'M I'M SOMEBODY

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:29.299
WHO BELIEVES THAT PROCESSMATTERS THAT THERE'S A

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.801
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A GREAT

00:44:30.868 --> 00:44:33.337
IDEA AND A GREAT DAHLE BETWEEN-

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.472
BUT AND- YOUR THE DETAILS

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.940
MATTER POLICY MAKING IN THE TO

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:37.741
HAVE LET'S JUST HAVE.

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.076
REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:41.779
THAT THAT WORK WE'VE GOT A- GOT

00:44:41.845 --> 00:44:42.279
TO REALLY HAMMER OUT THE

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.247
DETAILS AND I AGREE WITH THE L.

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:44.882
A. R. BUT THIS ISN'T. REALLY

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:45.783
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD GO

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:46.850
THROUGH THE POLICY MAKING

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.352

WITH- AND THE COMMITTEE PROCESS

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.022
WITH WITH COLLEAGUES. I THINK

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.690
THERE ARE A LOT OF- A LOT OF

00:44:53.757 --> 00:44:54.558
MEMBERS WHO HAVE AN OF THE

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:55.392
OPPORTUNE TO FOCUS ON THE

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:56.493
DETAILS HERE SOME GLAD WE'RE

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.362
GONNA HAVE THIS HEARING TODAY-

00:44:58.429 --> 00:44:59.830
BUT I REALLY DO. HOPE THAT

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:00.831
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.466
OPPORTUNITIES TO. FURTHER

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:08.672
DEVELOP THIS THROUGH. LOS

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:09.206
CENTER I JUST LIKE. TO THE

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.208
LARGEST. STAMP ON ON THIS WORK

IN FOR WHERE THAT LEAVES ME IS

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:14.478
B. A STRONG SO OF THIS OF

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:15.846
BELIEVING THAT IN THE- CAN'T H.

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:18.082
CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY- BUT

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.983
I THINK WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:20.684
HAPPENS THIS YEAR THE

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.086
LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO NEED TO

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:23.687
BE ENGAGED AND PROVIDE STRONG

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:24.955
GUARDRAILS AND DIRECTION AND

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:27.491
OVERSIGHT AND JUST TURN OVER

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.827
THE KEYS TO AN AGENCY TO THE

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.727
ADMINISTRATION. I JUST LIKE HAS

00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:31.762
A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.197
IN THIS PROCESS. I THINK WE ALL

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:35.532
BELIEVE THAT- AND SO AGAIN I

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.434
JUST WANT TO. YOU KNOW URGE

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:39.303
THAT WE CONTINUE TO PLAY A

00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:40.537
REALLY ACTIVE ROLE IN THIS

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:41.738
PROCESS SO. YOU TO THOSE WHO

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:43.841
ARE OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF THIS

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:44.975
AGENCY I THINK THAT THE

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:45.742
WRITINGS ON THE WALL BEFORE

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.244
HE'S GONNA HAVE A STRONG

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:48.479
CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY.

00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:49.179
WE'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:50.347
PROTECTING CONSUMERS IN THE

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.316
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I REALLY

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:57.254
IS AN IMPORTANT IDEA. AGAIN I

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:58.021
THINK THE PROCESS REALLY

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.690
MATTERS AND I THINK IT'S

00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:01.992
SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH SOME

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:02.493
CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:03.627

LIMóN FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.470
DONE I SHARE SOME OF THE KIDS

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:14.605
ARE TALK TO SO THE PROPONENTS

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.773
AND THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.111
AND I DO. WORRY THAT THE WAY

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:22.146
THIS WAS BROUGHT TO US THIS

00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:24.481
YEAR. IT JUST KIND OF TALK TO

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.983
THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE

00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:27.451
SETS A BIT OF AN ALARMING

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:30.621
PRECEDENT. HOWEVER IN THIS

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:32.723
PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE OF THE

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.091
LEADERSHIP OF THE CHERUB OF

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:35.959
BANKING AND FINANCE WE HAVE

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:38.529
HEARD. ABOUT THIS IDEA WE'VE

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:40.430
HAD HEARINGS ON THIS IDEA. WE

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.566
HAVE HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.501
TO FRAME WHAT ULTIMATELY IS

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:46.603
BEFORE US HERE TODAY AND HAD IT

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.772
NOT BEEN FOR CHIRLA MOANS

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.908
INVOLVEMENT IN THE LANGUAGE

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:53.010
THAT WE'RE- LOOKING AT AND IT

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:54.745
WILL BE A PART OF THI. BUDGET

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:57.581
TRAILER BILL- I WOULD BE VERY

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.416
CONCERNED ABOUT US JUST TAKING

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.084
LANGUAGE AND THEN PASSING IT

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.320
ON. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.155
IS THE CHAIR HAS BEEN. A VERY

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.558
SIGNIFICANT PART OF CRAFTING

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:09.359
THIS BASED ON WHAT THE

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:11.929
LEGISLATURE HAS DONE. SO WE IN

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:15.599
FACT HAVE PUT OUR STAMP. ON HOW

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.701
THIS. BUDGET TRAILER BILL IS

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:19.803
MOVING FORWARD. IT DES NEED TO

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:20.571
BE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:22.339
BUDGET BECAUSE IT DOES NEED TO

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:24.174
BE MADE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:25.342
BUDGET COMPONENT EVEN THOUGH

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:27.211
THERE'S NO GENERAL FUND. THERE

00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:28.645
ARE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS TO THIS

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:30.247
BECAUSE THE WAY THE STATE

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:31.615
COLLECTS AND DISTRIBUTES MONEY.

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:32.983
FOR MEMBERS I WILL TELL YOU

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.818
THIS IS PROBABLY Vì MOST

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:37.888
SIGNIFICANT. PIECE OF POLICY.

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:40.324
WE COULD BE DOING TO BENEFIT

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.559
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS RIGHT NOW.

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.995
AND IF WE LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:47.030
IT'S GOING TO BECOME HARDER AND

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:49.399
HARDER AND HARDER TO PASS.

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:51.435
WE'RE NOT ADDING LAYERS OF

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.636
REGULATION WHAT WE'RE REALLY

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:55.405
DOING IS GIVING APPROPRIATE

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:58.008
TOOLS TO OUR REGULATE. TO GO

00:47:58.075 --> 00:48:00.410
AFTER THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:01.845
PREYING ON CALIFORNIA

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:04.581
CONSUMERS. WITH FINANCIAL

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:07.284
APPLICATION THAT IS SOMETHING

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:09.119
THAT HAS BEEN MISSING SINCE THE

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:10.254
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.289
BACK OFF ON ITS PROTECTION OF

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.890
CONSUMER SO I THINK WE'RE GOING

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:14.658
TO HEAR IT AND THE

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:15.826
ADMINISTRATION I HOPE IS

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:19.696
HEARING US LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:23.300
HOW THEY BRING FOR. TO A HAD WE

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:25.802
NOT BEEN SO INVOLVED AND HAD

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:28.205
SUCH AN ABILITY TO FRAME WHAT

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:30.340
THIS IS I THINK IT MIGHT END UP

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:32.276
WITH A DIFFERENT RESULT SO WE

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:34.344
NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.480
LOSING THIS OPPORTUNITY HERE.

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:37.981
TO DO OUR BEST FOR CALIFORNIA

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:40.350
CONSUMERS. THAT'S SOMETHING WE

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.551
REALLY NEED TO DO SO I'M

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:43.787
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. ABSOLUTELY

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:45.155
HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:46.156
IDEA ALL ALONG I'VE BEEN A PART

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:47.824
OF ALL OF THE HEARINGS AND THE

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:50.260
CONVERSATIONS. THAT WE CREATE

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:53.096
THIS MECHANISM IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:56.266
BENEFIT CONSUMERS SO I'M HOPING

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:59.169
WE DON'T GET LOST IN SOME OF

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:02.372
THE CONCERNS AND THAT BECOMES A

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:04.574
SMOKE SCREEN. FOR US TO DO WHAT

SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT I HAVE

A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENFORCE

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:53.710

THOSE COMMITTEE. I CONSUMER AND

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:03.487
TRYING FIGURE OUT WHY THE

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:05.322
APPROPRIATE LINE IS BETWEEN

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:06.556
ALLOWING BUSINESSES FREEDOMS TO

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:08.091

POINT WHICH THE BUDGET COULD

INTO THE FUTURE. ALL IN

ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.717
CONSIDER HOW TO BALANCE THE

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.319
TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP A

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:06.155

CONSUMERS AND ON A TIMELY

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:16.065

THE PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.701
FACT THAT THE CODE. HAS

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:21.103
TRUNCATED THE USUAL BUDGET AND

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.005
POLICY PROCESS. THE LEGISLATURE

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.507
MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TAKING

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:26.075
MORE TIME TO EVALUATE THE

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:28.210

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.752
FOR REGULATORY PROCESS

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.954
DISPATCHER. IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.756
ONCE MORE TRYING TO CONSIDER

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:44.860
THE PROPOSAL IT COULD DIRECT

IT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.570
THE MEANTIME HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.839

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.742

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:12.855
EASIER CONSIDERING THE

APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.192
VERSUS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

FRONT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.135
HAS STEPPED BACK FROM ITS

TRADITIONAL- REGULATORY ROLE-

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.573
WITH RESPECT TO MANY OF THESE

ENTITIES HOWEVER IT'S POSSIBLE

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:33.676
THAT FUTURE FEDERAL

ADMINISTRATIONS WILL TAKE A

01:08:35.744 --> 01:08:37.646
MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH TO THE

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:39.348
EXTENT THAT HAPPENS IT COULD

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.851
RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALUE

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.487
ADDED OF THE STATE'S ROLE IN

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.589

CALIFORNIANS DURING THE

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:39.254
PANDEMIC. WHEN THEY'RE MOST

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:40.722
FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE WHICH IS

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.923
SOMETHING I THINK EVERYONE IN

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.658
THE CHAMBER CAN AGREE WITH-

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:45.860
BUT- WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT OF

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:46.995
COURSE AGAINST. THE NEED FOR US

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:48.430
TO BE DELIVERED AND MAKE SURE.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:49.431
THAT WE'RE BEING FAIR AND

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.166
BALANCED AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT.

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.400
MAKING WHAT'S GOING TO BE.

01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:54.569
EVENTUALLY A FAIRLY MAJOR

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.471
CHANGE ON THIS PART OF- OF

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:59.607
CALIFORNIA FINANCE SO COULD YOU

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:00.542
TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT.

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:04.279
YEAH I'D BE HAPPY. I THINK IT'S

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:06.081
IMPORTANT TO THINK THROUGH

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:10.719
PASSED- FINANCIAL CRISES AND-

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:13.321
WHAT WHAT WE CAN OBSERVE IS

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:15.457
THAT THERE IS THERE ARE COMMON

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:18.159
PATTERNS WHENEVER WE GO THROUGH

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.761
A FINANCIAL CRISES OF

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.463
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.432
EXPERIENCING- EXPERIENCING

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:26.000
DIFFICULTIES AS THEY GO THROUGH

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:29.571

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:35.343
SO. FOR EXAMPLE AND WHAT WE I

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:37.445
THINK ARE STARTING TO SEE WITH

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:40.482
THE INCREASING COMPLAINTS. AS

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:41.916
THE HOUSEHOLD BALANCE SHEETS

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:45.286
STARTS TO EXPERIENCE A- A

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:48.523
FREEZE ON THE GROWTH SIDE- THE

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:50.558
STRUGGLE BECOMES WHERE THEN TO

THERE IS TO BE OUR THEY ARE BAD

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.940
ACTORS OUT IN THE MARKETPLACE

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:08.143
THAT ARE LOOKING TO CAPITALIZE

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.011
ON SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:12.380
ANXIETIES AND FRUSTRATIONS OF

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:14.582
CONSUMERS AND SO YOU START TO

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:16.918

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:18.686
WHETHER IT BE THROUGH-

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:22.791
INVESTMENT SCHEMES OR DEBT

DOLLAR AND SO THE OBJECTIVE IS

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:38.506
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:44.379
ABILITY TO STEP IN AND STOP HE-

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:46.314

NOT JUST FOR OUR DELIBERATIONS

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.355

ABOUT OVERSIGHT THAT'S WITH THE

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.320
BIG ISSUE TODAY'S JUST

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:01.723
OVERSIGHT HEARING THERE'S NOT

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.024
BEEN ANY POLICY. DEBATE ABOUT

THIS AND NO PRECISE THAT'S WITH

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:07.262
THE BIG ISSUE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:07.829
WE'RE SEPARATE AND CO EQUAL

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.697
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.266
I FIND INTERESTING AND IF YOU

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:14.602
CAN RESPOND TO THIS. IS THE

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:17.438
LANGUAGE THE CC. FPL EXPRESSLY

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.674
GIVE THE D. F. PI THE POWER

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:20.708
LIBERALLY CONSTRUE THE

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:23.077
PROVISIONS. AND THAT CREATED SO

01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:24.546
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN LIBERALLY

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:26.481
CONSTRUED. THE TECHNICAL TERM.

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:27.749
DOES THAT MEAN THAT D. F. P.

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:29.651
LIKE IN YOUR ALLEY UNILATERALLY

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.853
IN FOR LEGISLATIVE INTENT. I

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.022
MEAN WE NEVER DO LAKE WAS LIKE

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.456
THAT BECAUSE OF HIS LEFT TO.

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:37.091
COULD BE A BIG DEAL WITH AND

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:38.726
THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT. SO

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:41.663
THE WILL THAT LANGUAGE MEAN FOR

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:45.133
US AS LEGISLATORS. I THINK THE

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:46.467
CONCEPT THAT LOOKED UP THE

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.669
PHRASE LITTLE LIBERAL

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.337
CONSTRUCTION IS SEEKING TO

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:51.406
CAPTURE IS AGAINST THIS THIS

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:56.344
NOTION OF AGILE REGULATION THAT

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:59.681
CAN- THAT CAN ADDRESS- FAST

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:02.483
EVOLVING PRODUCTS SERVICES ON

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:05.820
THE MARKET PLACE. THIS VARIOUS

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:07.689
CONCEPTS IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:10.258
WERE BORROWED FROM THE TWENTY

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.492
TEN DODD FRANK ACT AND I CAN'T

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:13.628
SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THIS THIS

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:15.296
PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF LIBERAL

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.998
CONSTRUCTION BUT I WOULD BE

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:20.868
SURPRISED IF- IF THAT CONCEPT

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:21.436
WERE WERE BORROWED FROM DODD

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:24.305
FRANK ITSELF. BUT IT'S WIDE

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:26.107
OPEN SO I MEAN IT'S OPENTO

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:27.208
INTERPRETATION SO WHATEVER

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:28.810
BUREAUCRAT- PERSON THE AGENCY

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:31.279
THAT. IT CAN BE VERY CAN VARY

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:33.181
WIDELY. AND THAT'S THE ISSUE

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:34.816
WITH THE SPECIFIC IN LANGUAGE

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.918
AND WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER STATE

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:39.854
AGENCIES HAVE DONE. IF IT

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.322
BASICALLY FOR LACK OF BETTER

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.358
WORDS DOWN WHATEVER THEY WANT

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.859
AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.327
STUDIES HE'S RESPONDING TO

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:48.496
LEGISLATORS REQUESTING COMMENT

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:49.931
SO I MEAN WHY WOULD YOU INSERT

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:52.000
LANGUAGE LIKE THAT. IS TO BE

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:56.804
MORE SPECIFIC. AGAIN ASSEMBLY

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:59.207
MEMBER I THINK THE INTENT HERE

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:02.010
IS TO IS TO RESERVE SOME

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:06.881
ABILITY TO- TO SCALE AND TO-

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:10.251
WORK IN AGILE FASHION TO MEET

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.419
THE FAST EVOLVING- FINANCIAL

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:14.055
SERVICES LANDSCAPE- THE LAST

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.657
DECADE OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:18.893
HAS SEEN- A RESURGENCE IN

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.361
TREMENDOUS GROWTH WITHIN THE

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:21.496
DIVERSITY AND THE TYPE OF

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:22.196
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:25.466

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:31.439
IS- THAT'S THE VELOCITY OF

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:32.473
CHANGE WITHIN FINANCIAL

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.542
SERVICES OVER THE LAST DECADE

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:36.544
HERE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:38.613
HAS BEEN FAIRLY ASTOUNDING I

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.615
CERTAINLY DON'T SEE. THAT

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.250
CHANGING ANYTIME SOON LET ME

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:45.053
MAKE ONE- LET ME JUST OBSERVE

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:47.021
ONE OTHER POINT- A STRUCTURAL

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:49.924
PIECE- YEAH AND A PART OF THE

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:52.427
PROPOSAL- VERY THERE IS

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.796
CONTEMPLATED A ROLE FOR AN

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:56.631
OMBUDSPERSON WHOSE FUNCTION

01:28:56.698 --> 01:29:01.703

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:09.210
DECISIONS BEING MADE AT THE

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:10.778
COMMISSION LEVEL OR ELSEWHERE

CREATION NO THE NEW DEPARTMENT-

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:18.212
AGAIN WE DON'T SEE THIS AS AS

01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:19.380
CREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT WE

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:20.515
SEE IT AT REVAMPING OUR

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.683
EXISTING AUTHORITIES OF GIVING-

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:25.419

PROTECT CONSUMERS AND- AND SO

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:31.459
MY ANSWER TO THAT FIRST

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:34.395
QUESTION IS YEAH. I WANT STOP

CURRENT DEPARTMENT- THE OTHER

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.014
POINT I THINK THAT IS THAT IS

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:29.183

PRIORITIES REGARDING THIS

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:21.502
PROPOSAL WOULD CHANGE IF WE

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:24.538

THIS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:37.318
NEEDED IN ANY EVENT- BECAUSE

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:39.353
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIAN

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.355
TORQUE AND TORQUE VALUES AND

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:43.791
CRITICALLY- BECAUSE I THINK

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:47.795
THAT- AMPLE COVERAGE IS ALWAYS-

01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:48.930
IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:53.467
CONCERN- AND- ONE IMPORTANT

01:32:53.534 --> 01:32:54.869
THING TO UNDERSTAND IS. WHEN

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:56.804
THE TWENTY TEN DODD FRANK ACT

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:58.439
WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:01.909
ELEVEN. IT DEPUTIZED EVERY

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:04.612
ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE COUNTRY

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.948
AND- AND I BELIEVE DISTRICT

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:07.848
ATTORNEYS THROUGHOUT THE

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.984
COUNTRY IT DEPUTIZE THOSE LAW

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:12.386
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO USE THE

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:16.190
TOOLS WITHIN DODD FRANK- AND TO

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:17.124
AND TO INVESTIGATING CIVILLY

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:19.293
PROSECUTE UNFAIR DECEPTIVE ACTS

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.395
AND PRACTICES WITHIN FINANCIAL-

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:23.364
WITHIN FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.231
SERVICES. THAT HAPPENED OVER A

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:27.401
DECADE AGO AND SO I DON'T THINK

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.070
ANYBODY WOULD TEN YEARS LATER

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:31.138
SAY. THAT WE'VE COMPLETELY

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.007
STAMPED OUT THAT ACTS AND

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:34.241
PRACTICES WITHIN FINANCIAL

01:33:34.308 --> 01:33:36.243
SERVICES EVEN THOUGH DAHLE

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:38.012
DEPUTIZED LONG ALL OF LAW

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:41.315
ENFORCEMENT ACROSS STATES TO DO

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.583
SO OVER A DECADE AGO. IT JUST

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:44.151
GOES BACK TO HAVING PROBLEMS

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:46.487
WITH THE G. DMV CAR I CAN GO ON

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.990

ACCESS TO PASS THE SMELL TEST.

EVEN WITH THE PROPOSAL IN PLACE

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:33.600
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL BE

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.436
ABLE TO ASK ME LAWS CREATE NEW

01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:36.970
LICENSING REGIMES DEFINED

FRANKLY IS THIS IS AN

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:56.924
OBSERVATION AND A COMMENT THAT-

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:59.426
I HAVE HEARD MORE THAN A

01:39:59.493 --> 01:39:59.960
HANDFUL OF TIMES FROM OUR

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:03.831
EXISTING LICENSEES WHICH IS- WE

01:40:03.897 --> 01:40:06.367
FRANKLY I WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:10.037
SOME SOLUTION THAT IMPOSES-

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:12.106
SENSIBLE REGULATION AND

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:13.774
EXPECTATIONS ON UNREGULATED

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.075
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BECAUSE

RIGHT NOW WE THE INCUMBENTS.

01:40:18.379 --> 01:40:22.549
BEAR A COST OF COMPLIANCE AND-

01:40:22.616 --> 01:40:24.818
AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF NEW

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:25.452
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:26.687
COMING INTO THE MARKETPLACE

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.922
THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE- THEY

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.958
DON'T HAVE THOSE SAME

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:34.595
EXPECTATIONS AND SO I WOULD-

01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:36.196
YOU KNOW I TAKE YOUR POINT

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:37.664
ABOUT ALLOWING THE MARKET

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:40.167
FUNCTION. ON ITS OWN I JUST

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:42.302
DON'T BELIEVE THAT I THINK ONE

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:43.904
HAS TO QUESTION THE PREMISE OF

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.006
WHETHER YOU HAVE AN EFFICIENT

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:47.841
MARKET WHEN YOU HAVE. REGULATED

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:49.777
INDUSTRIES ON THE ONE HAND AND

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:52.646
THEN ON REGULATED INDUSTRIES-

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:53.981
TRYING TO BUY THEIR WAY INTO

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:56.417
THE MARKET PLACE- AND GRAB AND

01:40:56.483 --> 01:40:58.152
GRAB MARKET SHARE AS QUICKLY AS

01:40:58.218 --> 01:40:59.686
POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:40:59.753 --> 01:41:03.090
THE CHALLENGE DUCKING ABOUT THE

01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:05.025
MADE WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:07.227
WHOLE CELL SIGNIFICANT HERE IN.

01:41:07.294 --> 01:41:08.662
THE ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:11.532
HERE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:17.271
THIS AND I CAN MAKE SOME. TIME

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:18.138

01:41:18.205 --> 01:41:19.006
HERE'S RECKONS FOR ALL LOT OF

01:41:19.072 --> 01:41:21.542
MEMBERS. AND I GUESS MY LAST

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:22.709
QUESTION IS MADE CERTAINLY A

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:23.644
LOT OF BROADER TORTILLAS BEING

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:26.180

01:41:26.246 --> 01:41:27.381
TO THIS. TO THIS NEW OF

01:41:27.448 --> 01:41:30.017
RESTRUCTURING. IS IT YOUR VIEW

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:33.353

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.222
PROPOSAL GRANTS. THAT THEY'RE

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:37.925
UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- THAT

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:39.993
PRODUCTS THAT ARE LEGAL TODAY

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.462
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL

01:41:41.528 --> 01:41:43.163
TODAY WOULD BE OR COULD BE

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:45.799
DEEMED ILLEGAL IN THE FUTURE BY

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:55.976
THE FBI. I DON'T. IT IS MY VIEW

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:57.778
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT-

01:41:57.845 --> 01:41:59.012
PRODUCTS THAT REGULATED

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:00.180
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALREADY

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:02.216
EXIST IN THE MARKETPLACE TODAY-

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:03.784
IT IS NOT MY VIEW THAT THOSE

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.853
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES-

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:07.254

DEFINITION OF A OF A PRODUCT

PRODUCT IS NO LONGER. ALLOWED

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:35.349
TO BE- SOLD IN THE MARKETPLACE

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:39.887
THAT POSSIBLE. I DON'T SEE HOW

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:41.054

ABOUT- HOW THIS IS BEING DONE

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:01.241
QUITE FRANKLY THE FACT THAT WE

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:02.442
CAN'T EVEN AGREE WHETHER IT'S

01:43:02.509 --> 01:43:04.211
AN EXPANSION OR NEW DEPARTMENT

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:06.346

FUNCTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:08.228
BY THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND- THE

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:11.398
LEGISLATURE IS FUTURE WORK. YOU

VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:18.505
OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE- THE UNIQUE

01:46:18.572 --> 01:46:21.007
MEETS THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:22.909
MEMBERS WITHIN WITHIN YOUR

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:23.877

THIS WAY. I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF

01:46:33.653 --> 01:46:37.724
THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT-

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:39.826
THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:42.229
DECADE AND- THE INFLUENCE OF

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:43.563

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:44.698
WITHIN FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND

01:46:44.765 --> 01:46:47.033
SERVICES. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.369
POTENTIAL BENEFITS HAS BEEN THE

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.638
ABILITY TO DELIVER- QUALITY

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.840

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:55.675
TO TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED

01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:57.210
COMMUNITIES I BELIEVE THAT VERY

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:59.813
DEEPLY AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.515
A FULL VERSION OF THAT. THAT IS

01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:03.784
WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE SOME

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.952
OF THE- ASPECTS OF THIS

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:08.255
PROPOSAL ARE THOSE MARKET

01:47:08.321 --> 01:47:11.358
MONITOR FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:15.295
ENHANCE CONSUMER. OR WE WOULD

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:19.099
HAVE FOR AND OFFICE FOCUSED ON-

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:22.169
ON SERVICE MEMBERS OR STUDENTS

01:47:22.235 --> 01:47:25.605
OR NEW AMERICANS WORK OTHER-

01:47:25.672 --> 01:47:27.107
HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:29.643
COMMUNITIES- I THINK THE

01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:32.012
OBJECTIVE IS TO BE DATA DRIVEN

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:34.514
TO LISTEN TO- THEIR THEIR

01:47:34.581 --> 01:47:35.949
PARTICULAR CONCERNS AND

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:36.817
EXPERIENCES WITH FINANCIAL

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:38.518
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SO THAT

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:41.688
WE CAN AGAIN HELP DRIVE. BOTH

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:43.156
SMARTER REGULATION BUT AS WELL

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:46.526
AS- BECOME A BETTER PARTNER ON

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:48.094
ON IN POLICY CONVERSATIONS

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.729
RELATED TO THOSE THOSE

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:52.299
CONSTITUENTS. AND I APPRECIATE

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.602
NICE TO HEAR BUT WHAT HAPPENS

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:57.571
WHEN IT'S NOT YOU. WHAT HAPPENS

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:59.706
WHEN IT'S WHEN IF THERE IS A

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:01.174
DIFFERENT LEADER WHO PUTS A

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:02.309
DIFFERENT PERSON IN YOUR PLANE

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.411
AND THEN. MY COMMUNITY HAS

01:48:04.477 --> 01:48:06.046

AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IF THIS.

01:48:10.283 --> 01:48:14.421
DEPARTMENT OR EXPANSION OCCURS.

01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.423
AGAIN I THINK THE STRUCTURAL WE

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:19.025
WOULD LIKE TO- I WOULD LOVE TO

I HAVE. YOU KNOW I CONSUMER

01:59:36.802 --> 01:59:38.004
PROTECTIONS SHOULD BE AT THE

01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:39.338
FOREFRONT AND THE PRIORITY OF

01:59:39.405 --> 01:59:41.140
EVERYTHING WE DO AND I THINK

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:42.842
THAT IS WHAT IS BEFORE US TODAY

01:59:42.909 --> 01:59:43.776
AND I WANT TO THANK THE

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:45.478
ADMINISTRATION FOR MOVING THAT

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:47.947
FORWARD- BUT I. I SHARE THE

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:50.149
CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:59:50.216 --> 01:59:51.684
REGARDING. SORT OF FUTURE

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:54.587
LOOKING- CONCERNS AROUND

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.188
OVERSIGHT AND ENSURING THAT WE

01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:57.890
HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE LAST

01:59:57.957 --> 01:59:59.392
YEAR WHEN. WE WERE

01:59:59.458 --> 02:00:00.960
CONTEMPLATING CHAIRWOMAN'S

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.595
INCREDIBLE BILL THAT LOOKED AT

02:00:02.662 --> 02:00:03.930
PREDATORY LENDING THE

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:06.065
CONVERSATION IS ROBUST AROUND.

02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:07.266
SORT OF FOCUSING ON THE FACT IT

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:08.901
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:10.069
ALSO ROBUST MARKETS AN

02:00:10.136 --> 02:00:11.704
OPPORTUNITY TO BORROW IS

02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:13.639
CRITICAL. AND SO HOW DO WE

02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:14.774
BALANCE SORT OF TAKING THOSE

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.208
PREDATORY PRACTICES AWAY WHILE

02:00:16.275 --> 02:00:17.810
ENSURING PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:19.579
BORROWING. AND MY CONCERN

02:00:19.645 --> 02:00:21.714
REMAINS THE SAME HERE WHICH IS

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:22.982
ALTHOUGH IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:24.283
PROTECTIONS PERSON GO AFTER

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:26.385
UNFAIR PRACTICES WE NEED TO

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:27.320
LOOK AT THE MARKETING SURE

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:27.887
WE'RE PROTECTING ACCESS TO

02:00:27.954 --> 02:00:29.822
CAPITAL BEING TIME. AND SO

02:00:29.889 --> 02:00:30.957
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IS

02:00:31.023 --> 02:00:32.725
CRITICAL IN MAKING SURE WE

02:00:32.792 --> 02:00:35.261
RETAIN THAT BALANCE. AND SO I

02:00:35.328 --> 02:00:36.529
WANT TO JUST BRING A QUESTION

02:00:36.596 --> 02:00:38.064
BACK TO THING THAT CAME UP

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:41.233
DURING A FAMILY OR BURKE. HI

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.435
WHICH IS THE BY. WHICH IS OF

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:44.604
OUR MAIN SOURCES OF OVERSIGHT

02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:45.471
FOR THE AGENCY'S AS WAS

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:46.706
MENTIONED AND I THINK WE AS A

02:00:46.772 --> 02:00:48.040
LEGISLATURE HAVE SEEN THAT

02:00:48.107 --> 02:00:51.344
WHERE WE GIVE FUNDING WITHOUT

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.579
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT IT-

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:54.914
NOT THAT'LL BRING UP HIGH SPEED

02:00:54.981 --> 02:00:57.416
RAIL BUT- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE-

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:59.485
THAT WE THEN LOSE THE ABILITY.

02:00:59.552 --> 02:01:00.953
TO REVISIT AND HAVE OVERSIGHT

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.289
IN THOSE. INSTANCES AND SO I

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:04.991
GUESS WHICH SHE MENTIONED I

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:06.025
WANT A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:01:06.092 --> 02:01:07.293
CLARIFICATION OF HIS ONCE WE

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:08.995
APPROVE THIS EXPENDITURE. WE

02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:11.063
CAN'T LOOK BACK AS WE DO WITH

02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:12.031
OTHER AGENCIES IS THAT RIGHT

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:13.666
THE YOUR- YOUR FUNDING IS

02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:15.701
ONGOING AND IS NOT REVISIT IN

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:17.637
FUTURE BUDGET. I GUESS

02:01:17.703 --> 02:01:19.572
DEPARTMENT FINANCED IN RESPONSE

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:20.206
THAT IF THEY FEEL LIKE THE MORE

02:01:20.272 --> 02:01:24.644
APPROPRIATE. HI KIMBERLY ABSENT

02:01:24.710 --> 02:01:25.578
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:26.912
YES WE'VE BUILT THIS IN AS

02:01:26.979 --> 02:01:30.483
ONGOING FUNDING RAMPING UP OVER

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:31.117
THREE YEARS AS THE COMMISSIONER

02:01:31.183 --> 02:01:33.719
NOTED. OKAY WHEN I WOULD URGE

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:35.287
US TO REVISIT THAT QUESTION AND

02:01:35.354 --> 02:01:36.555
MAYBE THAT'S WHERE OVERSIGHT

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:39.091
WILL COME IN- BECAUSE I DO

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:41.093
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK. LONG AND

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:43.529
HARD AT HOW WE CONTINUE TO

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:44.964
EXERCISE OUR AUTHORITY AS A CO

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:46.332
EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:46.966
I DO BELIEVE THAT IS AN

02:01:47.033 --> 02:01:48.501
IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT. THANK

02:01:48.567 --> 02:01:49.802
YOU OUT OF HERE. THANK YOU SOME

02:01:49.869 --> 02:01:57.643
AIRBAGS. MCCARTY. ARE THEY ON

02:01:57.710 --> 02:02:01.947
OUR OKAY- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:02:02.014 --> 02:02:03.349
A BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS AND

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:06.285
THEN- DEBATE ABOUT THE POLICY

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:07.119
AND FIRST I'M I'M NOT ON THE

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:09.021
BANKING COMMITTEE I'M NOT A SUB

02:02:09.088 --> 02:02:09.889
FOR THIS IS THE OVERSIGHT

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:12.525
HEARING OF SUBJECTS OF SOMEWHAT

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.527
NEW TO THIS POLICY AREA BUT-

02:02:14.593 --> 02:02:16.128
ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE

02:02:16.195 --> 02:02:17.063
VERY INTEREST IN FINANCIAL

02:02:17.129 --> 02:02:19.765
SERVICES THIS IS A BIG ISSUE

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:20.199
WE'VE HEARD FROM. I

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:22.201
STAKEHOLDERS. BUT BUT THE ISSUE

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:23.936
I JUST WANTED TO SAY ABOUT

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:26.605
BEING AT RUSHED THROUGH I THINK

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.808
THAT- A LITTLE BIT SHALLOW. FOR

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:31.277
REASONS WE HAD SOME BUDGET

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:33.646
TRAILER BILLS THAT LITERALLY

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:36.015
WERE PROPOSED. A COUPLE NIGHTS

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:38.684
BEFORE THEY WERE IN FRANCE AND

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:40.853
WE SAW THAT ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.521
WHERE THEY WEREN'T IN THE

02:02:42.588 --> 02:02:44.857
JANUARY BUDGET THEY WEREN'T IN

02:02:44.924 --> 02:02:48.127
THEM MAY REVISE THEY WERE. CAME

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:50.663
TO LIGHT SOME OF THE IDEAS JUST

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:51.831
SEVENTY TWO HOURS BEFORE THE

02:02:51.897 --> 02:02:53.532
PROPOSED BE VOTED ON THIS FLOOR

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:55.334
SO THAT I THINK IS VERY

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:56.535
PROBLEMATIC AND I OBJECTED TO

02:02:56.602 --> 02:02:58.537
THAT. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:02:58.604 --> 02:03:00.740
PROPOSAL THAT WAS SUBMITTED IN

02:03:00.806 --> 02:03:02.675
THE MAY REVISE OUR BEFORE THAT

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:05.144
IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. I DON'T

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:06.112
THINK THAT YOU CAN USE THE

02:03:06.178 --> 02:03:07.980
ARGUMENT THAT THIS DIDN'T HAVE

02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:10.916
AMPLE TIME FOR- I'VE ALSO TAKE

02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:12.585
A LOOK AT IT AND FOR VETTING

02:03:12.651 --> 02:03:13.819
GRANTED WE DIDN'T HAVE THEIR

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:15.221
VETTING THIS YEAR WE HAD AND

02:03:15.287 --> 02:03:16.622
OTHER LEGISLATIVE YEARS BUT TO

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:19.058
SAY THAT IT'S- SPRUNG UPON US

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:20.726
AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR I THINK-

02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:24.130
IS NOT QUITE ACCURATE SAYS. FOR

02:03:24.196 --> 02:03:25.564
THE RECORD I WANT TO SAY THAT-

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:29.168
YOU KNOW OVERALL- IN THIS. COLD

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:31.937
ED WORLD WE SEE A REALITY THAT.

02:03:32.004 --> 02:03:35.741
THAT PEOPLE OF AND- YOU KNOW

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:37.343
HOW ECONOMIC STRESS IN OUR

02:03:37.409 --> 02:03:39.612
COMMUNITIES SOURCES ARE GETTING

02:03:39.678 --> 02:03:41.647
HAMMERED AND WE SEE THAT LEFT

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:44.950
AND RIGHT. AND JUST FOR THE

02:03:45.017 --> 02:03:46.418

DIFFICULT AND COSTLY ON- ON

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:37.215
COMPANIES WITHIN THE SPACE- BUT

02:12:37.282 --> 02:12:40.218

MANAGEMENT IS A WAY OF LIFE.

02:12:45.857 --> 02:12:48.727
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE- CHANGING

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:49.561
PREFERENCE THE CHANGING

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:52.230
PREFERENCES OF A CUSTOMER AGAIN

02:12:52.297 --> 02:12:53.598
HOW MANY MORE CUSTOMERS

02:12:53.665 --> 02:12:54.766
ACCESSING CAPITAL THROUGH ONE

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:55.967
OF THESE THAN WALKING INTO

02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:58.136
BRICK AND MORTAR THAT PRESENT

02:12:58.203 --> 02:13:02.441
VERY PROFOUND- VERY PROFOUND

02:13:02.507 --> 02:13:04.776
CHALLENGES. UNDERSTANDABLE

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:08.180
PALACE FOR COMPANIES PRODUCT IN

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:13.785
THE. IT'S AND THEN OF COURSE

02:13:13.852 --> 02:13:16.621
WILL BE SOME OF AN ACTOR WITHIN

02:13:16.688 --> 02:13:19.024
THE PRODUCTS AND SPACE OUR THAT

02:13:19.091 --> 02:13:20.625
WILL BE ALLERGIC TO THE NAY OF

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:23.829
REGULATION AND WILL WILL OBJECT

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:27.399

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:32.637
INCREMENTAL REGULATION AND I

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:34.005
THINK IT'S JUST IT'S IMPORTANT

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:36.375
TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THAT

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:38.110
THERE WILL OF COURSE ALWAYS BE

02:13:38.176 --> 02:13:44.449
SUBSTANCE OF ACTOR. WILL OBJECT

HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE

02:14:03.568 --> 02:14:04.069
THAT EVERYONE'S PLAN BY THE

02:14:04.136 --> 02:14:06.872
SYMBOLS. WELL I THINK IT'S

02:14:06.938 --> 02:14:08.840
IMPORTANT TO USE. IT'S

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:10.442
IMPORTANT TO BRING TO BEAR ALL

02:14:10.509 --> 02:14:13.712

AGAIN TODAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:20.919
THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE.

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:24.489
THE ABILITY TO SUPERVISE

02:14:24.556 --> 02:14:28.493

ECOSYSTEM. ONE OF THE- ARE

02:14:36.701 --> 02:14:39.971
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF- REALLY

02:14:40.038 --> 02:14:44.342
IMPORTANT AND PROFOUND- ASPECTS

02:14:44.409 --> 02:14:46.077
TO DODD FRANK WHEN IT WHEN IT

02:14:46.144 --> 02:14:49.781
PASSED- ABOUT A DECADE AGO. ONE

02:14:49.848 --> 02:14:53.285
OF THE- PROFOUND ELEMENTS OF

02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:55.220
DODD FRANK WAS- THE WRECK IN

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:56.855
THE RIGHT THE RECOGNITION AND

02:14:56.922 --> 02:14:58.490
THE NEED FOR FUNCTIONAL

02:14:58.557 --> 02:15:01.359
REGULATION THE NOTION THAT. THE

02:15:01.426 --> 02:15:02.727

SPACE WILL WILL ALWAYS CHANGE-

02:15:08.233 --> 02:15:10.602
VERY VERY RAPIDLY AND SO THERE

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:11.036
WAS THAT THERE WAS A

02:15:11.102 --> 02:15:13.104
RECOGNITION FOR. THE NEED TO

FUNCTIONALLY REGULATE THAT

02:15:15.273 --> 02:15:16.775
INDUSTRY AND THEN THE SECOND I

02:15:16.842 --> 02:15:19.978
THINK IMPORTANT INSIGHT- THAT

02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:21.847
THAT OFFERING TAUGHT US AND

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:23.315
THAT WE BORROW FROM FOR THIS

02:15:23.381 --> 02:15:27.886
PURPOSE. IS D. VAN OF HAVING

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:29.921
MULTIPLE TOOL TO BRING CARE TO

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:32.057

FROM FROM EXAMINE. A COMPANY'S

02:15:48.507 --> 02:15:50.475
AND IT IS INDUSTRIES TO MAKE

02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:51.409
SURE THAT YOU ARE. THE FINAL

02:15:51.476 --> 02:15:52.744
LEVEL WHAT ARE THE BUSINESS

THIS FIGHT ON ITS OWN IRREGULAR

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:33.118

THAT THE LEGISLATURE GOES

02:17:43.521 --> 02:17:47.859
THROUGH. WELL IS THE I THINK

02:17:47.926 --> 02:17:49.961

CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THIS

02:18:12.183 --> 02:18:14.619
AREA WAS. THE HOMEOWNERS BILL

02:18:14.686 --> 02:18:15.887
OF RIGHTS IN RESPONSE TO THE

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:18.223
FORECLOSURE CRISIS. AND THAT

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.425
WAS A PARTICULAR CRISIS WHERE

02:18:20.492 --> 02:18:22.927
AGAIN- WE AS A COUNTRY WE

02:18:22.994 --> 02:18:26.231

02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:32.603
SECTION FOR YOU DATA. WHICH IS

02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:34.204

THAT THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN

02:33:47.484 --> 02:33:50.988
HAPPENING- IN CERTAINLY- WE

02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:54.258
ALSO NEED TO ASK OURSELVES DO.

02:33:54.325 --> 02:33:55.593
FOR EXEMPTION KNOWING THAT.

02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:59.096
YEAH UNFAIR TO DEVELOP ACTS AND

PRACTICES IS A PART OF THE

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:02.433
FEDERAL LAW I'M SO THIS WOULD

02:34:02.499 --> 02:34:04.735
ALLOW STATES TO ADD A STATE

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:06.804

HAVE SOME WAY IN OUR STATE- TO

02:34:13.177 --> 02:34:14.912
PRESERVE WHAT I THINK IS REALLY

02:34:14.979 --> 02:34:17.348
IMPORTANT- IN THE END I THINK

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:21.619
THAT ALL OF THESE AT. ANY TIME

02:34:21.685 --> 02:34:24.521

CONSUMERS CAN BEND MEANS THE

02:34:55.319 --> 02:34:57.154
SYSTEM IS WHAT. SO I THINK

02:34:57.221 --> 02:35:00.958
