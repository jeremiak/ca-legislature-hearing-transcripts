00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.075
NOT LIKE A HUMAN BEING TO BE

00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:13.759
BUT THE PARENT OR GRANDPARENT

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.393

AN INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE STUDY

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:48.760

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:16.194
POTENTIALLY GIVE THEIR LIVES TO

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.229
THE FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES.

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:23.468
THEY WILL CHERISH.

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:25.303
IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.671
PROCESS OF GETTING IT

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.172
CITIZENSHIP IS A VERY ARDUOUS

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:29.307
PROCESS.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:31.008
IN THE UNITED STATES WELL THERE

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:32.243
WAS A DIFFERENCE WHEN MY

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.679
GRANDPARENTS AND GREAT

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:35.580
GRANDPARENTS CAME TO THIS

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.782
COUNTRY THE THEY CAME TO THIS

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:40.318
COUNTRY THEY THAT ALL THE LEGAL

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:41.386
PAPERWORK THAT WAS NECESSARY TO

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:43.321
COME IN.

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:45.189
BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT WE

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:46.257
HAVE WITNESSED AT THE BORDER

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.860
OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:51.095
IS NOT A MIGRATION OF PEOPLE

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:52.230
INTO THIS COUNTRY BUT IT'S BEEN

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:54.031
AN INVASION OF PEOPLE COMING

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:56.367
INTO THIS COUNTRY.

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:56.934
AND HI.

00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:58.369
SORRY IF I OFFEND PEOPLE WHEN I

00:33:58.436 --> 00:33:59.904
SAY THAT BUT IT IS AN INVASION

00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:01.639
OF OUR COUNTRY WHEN YOU DON'T

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:02.840
PROTECT YOUR BORDERS.

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:03.708
WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE FROM THE

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:04.976
SOUTH PEOPLE FOR THE NORTH

00:34:05.042 --> 00:34:06.711
PEOPLE FROM THESE PEOPLE FROM

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:07.211
THE WEST.

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:08.579
AND PEOPLE THE STATE

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:10.515
CALIFORNIA'S COUNTRY ARE UPSET

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:12.650
ABOUT AND THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:15.787
TO BE UPSET ABOUT IT.

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:16.854
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH MONEY TO GO

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:20.024
AROUND.

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:21.092
AND WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.694
THOSE FUNDS. FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:25.029
LEGALLY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:26.831
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE.

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:27.365
THAT WANT TO COME TO THIS

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:29.767
COUNTRY. TO GO THROUGH THE

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:32.203
PROCESS IS LIKE OUR FOREFATHERS

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.672
DID IN COMING HERE [inaudible]

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:45.082
LEGALLY.

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:45.650
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:51.656
SENATE.

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:53.691
WE HAVE TWENTY ONE BILLION

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.359
DOLLARS IN REVENUE COMING INTO

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.428
THE STATE.

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:00.531
MONEY THAT WASN'T ANTICIPATED.

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:05.803
AND WE THROW OUT PROGRAMS.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.904
TO HELP THE HOMELESS THE POOR

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.439
BROOKS OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS TO

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:11.843
PROVIDE HEALTH CARE.

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:12.610
AND I THINK IT'S VERY NOBLE THE

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:14.545
WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:15.546
PEOPLE LESS FORTUNATE THAN

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:18.216
OURSELVES.

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:19.917
BUT IF WE GO WITH EVEN THE

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.352
ASSEMBLY IS VERSION IT'S GOING

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:22.720
TO COST THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.222
PROVIDE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.790
INTO THIS STATE.

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:28.826
WITH FREE MEDICAL CARE.

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:33.030
WITH EBT CARDS TO FEED THEM.

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.966
WE ARE GOING TO BE [inaudible]

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:37.168
A MAGNET.

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:39.804
THAT IS GOING TO FURTHER ATTRACT.

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:43.741
PEOPLE. TO THE STATE OF

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:45.109
CALIFORNIA THIS RUNNING TO

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.211
WILLING TO WRITE A BLANK CHECK.

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:47.778
TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO COME

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:50.014
HERE.

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:53.251
AND WHEN WE DELUDE.

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.419
OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE

00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:56.521
LESS VULNERABLE THAT ARE LEGALLY

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.389
HERE.

00:35:58.456 --> 00:35:59.790
I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE DOING A

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:04.128
DISSERVICE. TO THE CITIZENS.

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:05.763
THAT LEGALLY CALL CALIFORNIA

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.265
HOME THAT ARE NATURALIZED

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:09.967
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:11.536
I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:12.770
GIVING THOSE CITIZENS THE FIRST

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.171
PRIORITY.

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.306
DID TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:19.310
AND OUR BUDGETARY ACCESSES.

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:20.845
AND IF AFTER WE SPEND THAT MONEY

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:21.879
WE TAKE CARE OF OUR HOMELESS

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.548
POPULATIONS WE TAKE CARE OF OUR

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:25.049
VETERANS.

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:25.750
AND WE PROVIDE QUALITY

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.852
HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS

OUR RESPECTIVE OF THEIR OF THEIR

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.924
NEEDS THE THEN WE SHOULD.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.058
CONSIDER OUR HUMANITARIAN

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.594
EFFORTS.

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:37.828
IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:41.866
RECOMMEND A STRONG NO VOTE IN SB.

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:42.466
TWENTY NINE THANK YOU SENATOR

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:52.877
I SUPPORT THIS BILL.

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:56.147
AS THE AS MANIC AMERICAN.

00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:58.249
MEXICAN AMERICAN WHATEVER YOU'D

HELP THOSE THAT NEED HELP.

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:05.489
THAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THIS

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:06.524
COUNTRY.

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:07.658
AND I THINK THAT WE ARE HERE IN

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.160
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:11.395
THINGS ABOUT EQUALITY INEQUALITY

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:12.697
THINGS THAT ARE FARE THINGS ARE

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.865
NOT FAIR BUT WE ALL UNDERSTAND

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:16.601
THIS ONE THING THAT'S ACROSS THE

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.369
BOARD WHEN YOU HAVE POOR HEALTH.

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:19.737
IT'S GOING.

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:21.205
TO MEASURE INTO SOMETHING ELSE

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:23.207
POOR HEALTH IS GONNA RESIGNATION

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:24.842
THE SOMETHING ELSE WE HAVE

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.177
PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP WE NEED TO

00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:27.178
HAVE PEOPLE THAT.

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:28.946
WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.948
THAT THEY'RE HERE AND WE'VE GOT

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.483
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.518
CARE OF THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS IN

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:37.421
THIS BILL WILL OPEN UP THAT DOOR.

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:39.156
MEDI CAL IS SO IMPORTANT.

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:41.592
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE FROM

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:42.226
NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AND WE

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:43.461
HAVE THE SENIORS THAT ARE SIXTY

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.996
FIVE AND ABOVE.

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:47.531
THE THE FACT IS THAT.

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:49.634
THIS BILL WILL START TO FINALLY

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.702
DO SOMETHING AND I APPLAUD THE

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.771
AUTHOR STANDING UP AND HAVE THE

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:55.640
INTESTINAL FORTITUDE TO FACE THE

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:56.907
OPPOSITION THAT'S GOING TO COME

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:58.042
NO DOUBT.

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:59.744
BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SO MANY

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.580
MORE OF US THAT REALIZE THAT

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:03.147
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF SO

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:03.714
MANY.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.082
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:07.685
RESPONSIBLE AND WE NEED TO TAKE

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.220
THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY.

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:10.688
AND I KNOW IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.289
BE AN AMERICAN THERE'S NO DOUBT

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:13.324
BUT WITH THAT PRIVILEGE COMES

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:14.892
RESPONSIBILITY SO LET'S TAKE

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:17.428
THIS ON AS A RESPONSIBLE BILL.

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:19.563
AND I KNOW THAT A MY CONCERN AND

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.365
I WILL SHARE THIS IS THE THE

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:22.867
ESCALATION OF TIME.

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.802
BUT THAT ESCALATION WILL BRING

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:25.736
IN SOME OF THE OTHER NEGATIVE

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.204
WHERE EVENTUALLY I HOPE THAT

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.139
WE'LL BE ABLE.

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:30.307
TO INSURE EVERYONE AND WHEN

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:31.509
WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND I

00:38:31.575 --> 00:38:33.444
THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY SAY THAT

00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:35.012
WERE COMING TOGETHER.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.280
AND SO I HOPE ALL OF US CAN

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:38.215
EXPLORE THE OPTIONS OF LATER

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.583
EXPANDING THIS TO INCLUDE

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.985
EVERYONE.

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.187
AND AND I THINK THAT THIS IS OUR

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:44.355
TIME.

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.223
THIS IS THE TWENTY NINETEEN

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.025
THEIR ISSUES OUT THERE BUT

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:48.759
THERE'S NO GREATER ISSUE THAN

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.195
HEALTH FOR CALIFORNIA POPULATION

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.963
IN THIS IS THE FIRST STEP.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:56.033
SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.538
THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL.

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:01.706
MISTER PRESIDENT I HAVE TO SAY

THAT I AMNEVER CEASE TO BE

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.876
AMAZED AS A SITTING MEMBER THE

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:09.113
CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.315
AND THAT EVEN IS LIFE AS A BLACK

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:13.551
WOMAN FIFTY FOUR YEARS FIFTY

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:15.720
FIVE IN SEPTEMBER.

00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:17.021
I HAD TO COME TO THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:20.524
LEGISLATURE. TO HEAR SOME OF THE

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:24.295
MOST RACIST CLASSES BANTER IN MY

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:29.266
ENTIRE LIFE.

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:30.835
THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:33.003
PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO ALL IS

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:33.938
NOT NEW.

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:36.340
IF YOU REFER TO THE FLOOR NOW

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:38.342
SINCE WE AT LEAST SINCE I'VE

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:39.810
BEEN HERE HAD THE SPECIFIC

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:44.248
CONVERSATION BUT DATING BACK.

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.483
TO TWENTY FOURTEEN SO WE CAN

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:46.984
SEPARATE THE DISCUSSION.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.720
BETWEEN WHAT'S COST EFFECTIVE

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:50.855
AND EFFICIENT FOR THE STATE OF

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:54.125
CALIFORNIA.

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:57.595
AND WHO'S WORTHY.

00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:58.963
I APPRECIATE MONDAY WAS VETERANS

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:02.333
DAY -- AND WE LIKE TO SPEND A

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:03.701
LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.402
VETERANS SHOULD BE DO.

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:07.371
AND ISUPPORT THAT BUT DO YOU

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:09.039
REALLY THINK THAT ANYBODY

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:11.308
DESERVES TO BE HOMELESS.

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:14.178
VETERAN OR OTHERWISE.

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:15.679
I'M NOT GOING TO PRIORITIZE A

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.915
VETERAN OVER ANYONE ELSE'S

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:18.182
HOMELESS.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:20.351
POINT BLANK.

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:24.221
HOMELESS IS HOMELESS.

AN INVASION.

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:54.511
IT'S INTRIGUING TO ME THAT

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:56.747
AGGRESSIVE WORDS LIKE INVASION

00:41:56.814 --> 00:42:00.017

IT WASN'T AN INVASION THEN.

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.402
THAT'S CURIOUS TO ME.

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:19.603
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THIS COUNTRY

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.440
WAS BUILT. TO THE INVASION OF

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:25.809
PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.912
MISTER PRESIDENT I WILL GO BACK

WERE BROUGHT HERE AGAINST THEIR

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:32.950

THAT I WOULD ARGUE AGAINST THE

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:51.168
NOTION.

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:53.604

CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:22.032
MEDICAID SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY.

AND MINE.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.492
THROUGH POP OF THE SIX AND THE

IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.529
WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:54.698
THAT MEDI CAL PROVIDERS ARE AN

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:55.699
INTEGRAL.

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:57.735
PART OF THE DELIVERY OF THE

00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.236
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ACROSS THE

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.221

THIS NOTION THAT ONE GROUP OF

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.157
IMMIGRANTS IS MORE WORTHY THAN

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:23.093

THIS WILL NOT ADDRESS OUR

COVERING THIS POPULATION WILL

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:32.209
IMPACT OUR HOSPITALS.

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.284

MISINFORMATION.

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:11.842

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:20.650
HOWEVER.

00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:22.519
IF YOU ARE A SENIOR.

AND HAVE LIVED IN STATE A

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:26.223
CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES.

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:28.525
AND HAVE WORKED.

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:32.362

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:34.598
AND THEREFORE.

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:36.600
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH A LOT OF

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:39.269
THE SENIORS THAT ARE NOW.

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:42.038
BEING REQUESTED TO RECEIVE OUR

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.807
MEDICAL SYSTEM.

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.842
IS THEY'VE BEEN PAYING INTO THE

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:48.378
MEDICARE SYSTEM. FOR ALL THE

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.380
REST OF US.

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:55.051
WE ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED BY THEM.

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:57.053
WE ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED BY THEM

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.658
THEY ARE PAYING FOR OUR MEDICARE.

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:04.060

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.998
SO I HINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:10.100
THAT WE LOOK AT THINGS IN A VERY --

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:12.636
LOGICAL WAY.

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:13.904
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THE

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.972
ESTIMATED [inaudible]

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.741
UNDOCUMENTED.

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.376
REVENUE COMING INTO THE MEDICARE

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:22.078
SYSTEM IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:24.314
THIS PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.615
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:26.750
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:30.287
BUDGET. TO PAY FOR THE SENIORS

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:32.823
AND THE YOUNG ADULTS COMING INTO

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.958
THE THIS MEDI CAL SYSTEM.

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:37.060
IN FACT WE'RE ALSO ALREADY

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:40.163
PAYING FOR THE HEALTHCARE.

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.898
AS POINTED OUT BY.

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:44.568
THE WORK THAT WE DO IN OUR LOCAL

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:47.270
PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:48.638
EMERGENCY ROOMS RE.

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:51.908
CLINICS WHICH OFTEN TIME WITHOUT

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:54.978
CHARGE PROVIDE THE MEDICAL CARE.

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.747
THESE ARE ON COVERED OF

00:51:57.814 --> 00:51:59.783
UNREIMBURSED EXPENSES BY THESE

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:00.784
CLINICS WHICH IS NOT A GOOD

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:02.752
THING.

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:05.155
SO I HIRED SUPPORT FOR THIS I

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:06.857
THINK THAT.

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:09.025
THE MONEY THAT IS PAID INTO THE

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:11.428
MEDICARE SYSTEM.

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.597
BY PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:15.932
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:19.135
HAS THERE PAYMENT OF TAXES.

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:20.403
THAT THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANY

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.138
BENEFIT FROM.

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:25.108
AND THEREFORE WE ARE OBLIGATED.

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.143
TO REIMBURSE THEM.

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.412
BY CREATING A SYSTEM OF HEALTH

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.847
CARE FOR THEM.

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.449
THAT SAVES NOT REALLY THEM MONEY

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.484
BUT SAVES US MONEY AND RESULTS

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:36.653
AN A A STRONGER HEALTHCARE

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.023
SYSTEM. FOR ALL OF US.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.359

OUR FAMILY WENT TO MY YEAH IT'S

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:51.101

JUSTICE FOR ALL.

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:04.748
AND HERE I THIS ASPIRATIONAL

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.783

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.122
UNITED STATES.

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:15.692
THAT'S WHAT A TRUE PATRIOT IS.

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:17.227
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT WE DON'T

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:19.095
TALK ABOUT INVASIONS ON OUR

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:22.566
BORDERS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT --

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:24.200
IN A PATRIOTIC SINCE INVASION ON

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.535
OUR BORDERS.

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:26.603
BECAUSE INVITATIONS ON OUR

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.905
BORDERS IS NOT THE KIND OF

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.941
PATRIOTISM.

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:33.910
THAT MY FAMILY OF SCRIBES.

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.879
TO AND MY FAMILY.

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:38.248
GOES BACK TO THE OFFICER THAT WE

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:39.849
HAD IN MY FAMILY DURING THE

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:42.485
REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:43.787
WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON.

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.889
SO OUR FAMILY OUR FAMILY IS A

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.624
VERY PATRIOTIC FAMILY.

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.626
AND WE BELIEVE IN LIBERTY AND

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:50.994
JUSTICE FOR ALL [inaudible]

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.096

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:43.773
BE.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.608
ENOUGH OF A REASON I WOULD ALSO

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:47.577
ARGUE THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.345
THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS IN YOUR

00:55:49.412 --> 00:55:50.780
SELF INTEREST IN THE SELF

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:54.651
INTEREST OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS --

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:57.387
AS WHEN WE EX WELL FIRST OF ALL

00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:58.421
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IN AND IT'S

00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:00.390
BEEN RESET HERE BUT I JUST HAVE

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:02.592
TO BRIEFLY SAY AGAIN IS IS THAT --

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:06.262
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH CARE

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:09.799
NEEDS -- WELL EVENTUALLY WE WILL

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.634
EVENTUALLY PAY FOR THEM NOW

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.269
USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:14.904
PAY FOR THEM TO GET A LOT WORSE

00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:16.906
WE PAY THEM FOR THEM IN A MUCH

00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:19.109
LESS EFFICIENT MANNER -- FOR

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:21.244
EXAMPLE -- I USE OF EMERGENCY

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:25.081
ROOMS -- HOSPITALIZATIONS --

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.783
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.018
TO AS MUCH TO PRIMARY CARE TO

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:31.621
OTHER -- PREVENTIVE MEASURES

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:34.457
THINGS THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:36.192
TO GET CARE IN A MORE COST

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:37.961
EFFICIENT AND HIGH -- AND AND

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:39.129
MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER.

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:41.698
AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:42.932
THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY.

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:45.201
REALLY SAVING MONEY PER SE TO

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:46.469
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS THAT WERE

00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:47.637
BASICALLY.

00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:49.272
SAYING THAT WELL WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:50.974
THE NIGHT CHAIR UNTIL YOU GET

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.209
REALLY REALLY SICK AND THEN --

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:55.145
WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TRYING

00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:58.281
TO SAVE YOU -- AND I'M NOT SURE

00:56:58.348 --> 00:57:00.550
THAT IS NECESSARILY THE MOST

00:57:00.617 --> 00:57:02.452
EFFECTIVE WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:04.420
IN FACT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:05.722
WE ARE READY HEY.

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:06.856
THROUGH OUR BUDGET THROUGH OTHER

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:10.193
MEANS -- WE COUNT ON WE HAVE A

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.728
COUNTIES REQUIRED THROUGH --

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:15.832
THERE'S INDIGENT CARE PROGRAMS --

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.834
TO PROVIDE CARE OUR CLINICS --

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.002
ACTUALLY OUR FELLOW QUALIFIED

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.303
HEALTH CENTERS THE HAVE TO TAKE

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.305
ALL COMERS ALTHOUGH ON A SLIDING

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:27.911
SCALE -- AND THIS MAKES THE

00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:28.945
HOWARD [inaudible]

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.413
BASICALLY.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.347
THIS IS A BAY AREA THOUGH TO

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:32.916
PEOPLE GETTING CARE UNTIL THEY

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:33.683
REALLY NEED IT.

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.351
THE A IN ADDITION OF COURSE WE

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:37.187
TALK ABOUT A LACK OF SPECIALTY

00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:39.189
CARE ACCESS AS WELL SO THAT

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:41.090
SOMEONE GETS BUT YET THEY WILL

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:43.259
GET IT EVENTUALLY -- WHEN THEY

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:44.027
SHOP THE MERCHANTS ROOM WHEN

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:46.162
THEY GET HOSPITALIZED AND THEN

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.164
THAT COST BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:51.301
BORNE BY THAT INDIVIDUAL OR THE

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.135
FAMILY?

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:53.303
HARD AS IT MAY TRY TO ACTUALLY

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:54.571
DO THAT THEN GETS DISTRIBUTED

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.372
AMONG ALL OF US.

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:57.740
IN FACT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:01.978
BEFORE WE IMPLEMENTED THE ACA --

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:04.047
WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH DOES

00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:05.515
EACH.

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:07.116
PRIVATELY SHIRT PERSON -- HAVE

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.052
TO PAY TO HELP PAY FOR ALL THE

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:09.552
CARE FOR THE PEOPLE ARE

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.654
UNINSURED -- AND THAT TURNED OUT

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.857
TO BE ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:16.025
PER PERSON -- WHO HAD PRIVATE

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.427
INSURANCE?

00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:19.028
SO WE ARE PAYING FOR THAT I

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:20.530
SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT BY THE WAY

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:22.131
THAT ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:25.969
UNINSURED -- ABOUT 40% CURRENTLY

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:27.770
AFTER WE INFLATED CA ARE A

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:29.305
DOCUMENT SO I SEE MAJORITY OF

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:31.107
UNINSURED ARE ACTUALLY NOT THE

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.109
UNDOCUMENTED.

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.244
BUT CERTAINLY IT IS IN OUR SELF

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.745
INTERESTS TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.180
MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE MORE

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:38.448
EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR HEALTHCARE

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:39.949
DOLLARS.

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:41.384
WE SHOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT THE

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.186
SOCIETAL COSTS THAT HAVING

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:44.387
PEOPLE LEAVING.

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.855
THE NINE CARE TO PEOPLE LEAVING

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:47.624
THEM UNINSURED ALSO ARE COSTS US

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.225
IN SOCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:51.027
TYPES OF THINGS THE LOST

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.729
PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR WORKPLACES --

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:54.697
WE TALK ABOUT MEDI CAL OF

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:57.567
ACTUALLY ASIDE FROM THE CHILDREN

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.601
WHICH ARE HALF OF ALL MEDICARE

00:58:58.668 --> 00:58:58.902
OUR FATE.

00:58:58.968 --> 00:59:00.403
THAT HALF OF ALL CHILDREN MEDI

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.938
CAL AND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:05.041
DISABLED -- MOST OF THE PEOPLE

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:06.042
ARE MEDI CAL ACTUALLY WORK.

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:08.111
THEY WORK AND SO -- THEY'RE

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:10.113
PAYING TAXES YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING --

00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:11.881
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ACTUALLY

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:14.050
THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ABILITY

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:15.885
CAN BE HAMPERED BECAUSE OF

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:16.619
ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:16.920
[inaudible]

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:18.421
SO.

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:21.024
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE REASON TO

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:22.592
VOTE FOR THE BILL IS NOT FEWER

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:24.127
HUMANITARIAN REASONS.

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.328
WHICH I HAVE -- IF THAT'S NOT

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:26.996
COMPELLING ENOUGH IT IS ACTUALLY

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.131
IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO SAY YOU

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:29.165
KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:30.500
MAKE THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:32.635
OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS WE SHOULD

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:34.237
ACTUALLY SEEK TO MAKE EVERY

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:36.406
PERSON IN CALIFORNIA AS

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:37.774
PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE.

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.541
AND WE SHOULD ALSO TRY THE

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:39.943
LATEST SEEK TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD

00:59:40.009 --> 00:59:42.178
ON OUR SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.146
TAXPAYERS ALSO [inaudible]

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:45.415
HEY.

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:48.184
FOR AND SO WITH THAT I URGE IN

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:50.086
AYE VOTES ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.654
BOTH BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:52.689
THING TO DO.

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:56.092
BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S IN ALL OF

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:58.428
OUR SELF INTEREST THANK YOU.

00:59:58.494 --> 01:00:01.097
THANK YOU DR GRANT SENATOR RUBIO.

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:02.231
THANK YOU -- WELL FIRST OF ALL I

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:03.599
WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.702
FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.036
THIS IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.204
I WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.340
BELABOR THE POINT THAT ALL MY

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.441
COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE EXPRESSED

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:13.176
AS A PERTAINS TO THE BACK BASIC

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:16.212
RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO BE

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.046
HEALTHY IN OUR STATE.

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:20.016
BUT I WILL SAY THIS.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.318
WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE I

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.821
FIND IT OFFENSIVE THAT IT'S AN

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:27.890
OPPORTUNITY? TO MISREPRESENT

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:31.060
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.795
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW I STAND

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:36.299
BEFORE YOU AS AN UNDOCUMENTED.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.266
SUPPORT IT.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.968
SENATOR IN THE SAME ROOM YOU'RE

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.536
ALL SET.

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:43.539
AND WHEN I HEAR WORDS LIKE

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:43.840
[inaudible]

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:46.509
INVASION.

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.978
IT REALLY IS OFFENSIVE.

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.480
AND I WANT MY COLLEAGUES TO LOOK

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:52.015
AT WHAT.

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.783
SOMEONE LOOKS LIKE WHEN GIVEN AN

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.284
OPPORTUNITY.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:58.087
NOT ONLY FOR A GOOD EDUCATION.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.389
GOOD HEALTH CARE.

01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:01.090
AND SO I WILL SAY TO MY

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:02.058
COLLEAGUE TODAY THAT I WILL BE

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.359
SUPPORTING IT.

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:06.696
BUT I HOPE THAT WE STOP.

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:09.565
CONFUSING THE TWO HEALTH CARE IS

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:12.402
NOT PERMISSION. TO BASH OR

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:15.138
MISREPRESENT UNDOCUMENTED.

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:17.440
IMMIGRANT INDIVIDUALS I FIND IT

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.409
PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE AND I HOPE

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.376
THAT THAT.

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.412
STOPS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.213
THAT I WILL BE VOTING YES.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.817
THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER.

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:28.684
THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:34.357
COLLEAGUES -- WELL I A WILL NOT

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.392
EVEN ATTEMPT TO BE AS ELOQUENT

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.894
AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.228
LOS ANGELES.

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:41.164
IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE REACTION

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:42.932
FROM SOME OF THE FLOOR COMMENTS

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.268
THAT WE HEARD EARLIER.

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.270
I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.771
COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:50.440
SACRAMENTO.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:53.443
AND WHILE I COMPLETELY SUPPORT

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:54.310
THIS BILL.

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.579
PURELY AND SOLELY BECAUSE IT IS

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:59.015
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:01.084
I THINK THOSE THAT MAY HAVE

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.519
EXPRESSED OR FEEL SOME OF THESE

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:06.022
NATIONALISTIC OR XENA PHOBIC

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.056
FEELINGS.

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.592
SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:12.495
THE REST OF THE POPULATION WHICH

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.197
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.566
REFERENCED.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:19.635
NOT ADDRESS BENEFIT FROM PEOPLE

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.771
WITH COMMUNICABLE.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:24.640
DISEASES OR TREATABLE INFECTIONS

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.809
HAVING THEM AND BEING AROUND OR

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.711
NEAR US.

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:32.448
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TIGHTENED UP.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.583
THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION AROUND

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.785
VACCINATIONS BECAUSE WE

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:38.387
UNDERSTOOD THAT.

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:41.657
WE NEEDED VACCINATIONS FOR OUR

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:44.127
GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH OF EVERYONE.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:47.230
SO IF WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.831
ABLE.

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.601
BECAUSE OF LACK OF THE OUR

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.569
COVERAGE OF HEALTHCARE. TO GET

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:55.671
TREATED FOR EXAMPLE OR EVEN GO

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:57.373
AND FIND OUT THAT THEY MIGHT

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.407
HAVE TUBERCULOSIS.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:01.277
AND I SAY TUBERCULOSIS BECAUSE

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:02.745
IT IS A MUCH MORE COMMON.

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:05.681
DISEASE AMONG LOW INCOME PEOPLE.

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:06.816
AND OF COURSE MUCH OF THE

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:08.518
POPULATION THAT WE ARE TALKING

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:11.254
ABOUT HERE THESE ONE HUNDRED AND

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:11.854
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT WE

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.756
MIGHT CONSIDER FOR THIS WOULD BE

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:14.757
COVERED UNDER THIS BILL.

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:17.326
OUR LOW INCOME.

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.929
IN CALIFORNIA HAS HIGH RATES OF

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.764
TUBERCULOSIS.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.901
IT IS A VERY CAN RECALL DISEASE.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.270
SEVEN FACTIONS MERCER.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.105
NONE OF US WANT.

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:32.441
ANYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:33.910
SCHOOLS.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:37.780
OUR WORK PLACES. TO GET ANY OF

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:38.347
THESE.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.583
IN YET OUR REFUSAL TO PROVIDE

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.518
HEALTH CARE.

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:45.421
COULD CAUSE THAT.

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.924
SO JUST FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.392
POINT OF VIEW THIS BILL MAKES

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.893
SENSE.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.861
NOW LET ME ALSO TALK ABOUT THE

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.329
BUDGETARY.

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:56.365
IT IS FALSE FISCAL PRUDENCE TO

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.401
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE

01:03:58.467 --> 01:03:59.669
COST ON THIS.

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:02.638
AND WHAT OTHER THINGS WE MAY BE

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.307
ARE SAYING NO.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:07.043
TO JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY ALONE

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.343
[inaudible]

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.512
ESTIMATES THAT.

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:12.882
THE EMERGENCY ROOM CHARGES.

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.750
THAT MAY RESULT FROM A PERSON'S

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:17.420
LACK OF HEALTH CARE.

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:20.456
SEE THE MEDICAL MEDI CAL COST

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.225
FOR APPROPRIATE TREATMENT BY

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:24.093
THIRTEEN TIMES.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.028
SO EACH INDIVIDUAL THAT WE DO

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:28.331
NOT COVER THAT INSTEAD USES AN

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:29.265
EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:32.435
IT'S COSTING US THIRTEEN TIMES

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:33.869
WHAT IT WOULD COST THEM US.

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.671
AND ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR JUST

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:38.107
PROVIDING WHAT'S IN THIS BILL

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:38.407
[inaudible]

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.643
ADDITIONALLY.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:44.513
THE MEDIAN COST OF THE ROOM

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.350
VISIT IN CALIFORNIA IS TWO

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:47.917
THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S THE

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:48.317
MEDIA [inaudible]

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.219
SO.

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:52.622
JUST FROM A FISCAL POINT OF VIEW

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:55.625
THIS BILL MAKES SENSE.

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:57.193
BUT FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.561
IT IS ABSOLUTELY.

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:03.165
THE ONLY AND RIGHT THING TO DO

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:03.466
[inaudible]

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:06.702
CENTER MORLOCK.

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:15.378
I'LL LEAVE THAT SUBJECT ALONE

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.446
FOR NOW.

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.515
BUT I ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

ADEQUATE FUNDING THAT WE NEEDED.

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.628
SO I'M CONCERNED MISTER

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.580
AS A BODY.

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:59.348
THAT HAS TO LOOK AT BUDGETS FOR

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:01.817
MANY YEARS. ONE THING ABOUT

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.052
BEING A LITTLE OLDER.

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.554
IS THAT YOU YOU KIND OF SEE HOW

AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:27.643
DO WE TAKE ON THESE COSTS.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.880

ON THE EMOTIONAL ISSUE OF

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:14.810

INTRODUCED IT DID HAVE A ROOT

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:27.823
RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT OR TO HAVE

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.191
A CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT AT

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.092
THAT TIME.

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:31.594
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE NEEDED TO

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.295
BE PROVIDING ABOUT TIED TO THE

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:35.764
PEOPLE OF THE STATE -- THE IT

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.633
HAS MORPHED OVER THE YEARS -- MY

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.969
PROBLEM WITH THAT IS VERY SIMPLY

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:42.471
THAT THERE'S AN ACCESS ISSUE IN

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.507

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.244
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE.

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:50.813
OUR I HAVE A BROTHER WHO'S VERY

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:52.781
ILL WE'VE BEEN AN EMERGENCY ROOM

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:55.551
I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.152
SERVICE IS POOR.

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:58.520
IT IS POOR BECAUSE THE

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.756
AVAILABILITY OF A SPECIALIST IN

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:01.757
THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND DOCTORS

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.792
IN PARTICULAR ARE NOT THERE

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:04.927
THEY'RE NOT THERE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.028
NOT REIMBURSING THEM

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.097
APPROPRIATELY.

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.132
SO I WILL CONTINUE -- TO

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:11.667

WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.504
HUMAN BEINGS AND I THINK THAT'S

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.540
BEEN PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.375
SUCH A DIFFICULT AND FRUSTRATING

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:27.543
DISCUSSION.

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:30.145
BECAUSE I TOO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:32.181
IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.516
THE END I HAVE BEEN SHOCKED.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.618
AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHETHER

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:39.254

FOR EMERGENCY ROOM CARE.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.192
AND THE THE LACK OF PHYSICIANS

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:45.194
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHO ARE

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.129
ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE AND

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.697
FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:49.398
COLOR.

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.100
WHO ARE IN THOSE EMERGENCY ROOMS

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:54.136
IN TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SHAPE AND

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.905
AS WAS POINTED OUT BY THE COULD

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.308

THINGS GOT A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:50.785
BUT IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES THERE

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:52.587
WAS SO MUCH SMOG THAT WE

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:03.865
BETTER AND WE CAN SEE THE

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.600

BELOVED LEE KNOWN AS DARKER. TO

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:57.898
DEVELOP AN ACCOUNTING MECHANISM.

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.800
FOR ASSESSING THE COST OF

THAT IS ALL THE BILL DOES.

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.946
THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:14.915
THE STATE IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL.

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:16.550
FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT TRUST

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:18.853
IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS.

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:20.521
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:23.791
SPENT OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:26.560

ABANDONED COSTA WELLS.

01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:41.742
AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:45.112
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE WELLS

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:45.880
OFF.

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:49.083

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:53.621

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:54.789
WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS.

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:56.557
ON IDENTIFYING THESE WELLS IN

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:59.427
DOING THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTING

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:00.995
FOR A SMALL.

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:03.431
PERCENTAGE OF THESE WELLS.

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:04.765
MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:07.201

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:09.203
DEALING WITH OFFSHORE WELLS IN

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.105
ORDER TO IDENTIFY THEM AND TO

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:13.774
TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COSTS

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.743
WILL BE IF WE IF AND WHEN THEY

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:17.044

IDLE DWELLS AND OFFSHORE WELLS.

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:31.092
BUT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:32.460
TWENTY THOUSAND OPERATING WELLS

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:34.528

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:39.767
THIS MECHANISM.

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.602
UNDER THIS BILL WILL DIRECT

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:44.538
DARKER TO DEVELOP A TRULY

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.607
COMPREHENSIVE TOOL. TO ASSESS

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.676
ALL INFRASTRUCTURE WE DO THIS

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:50.911
NOW FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE SURFACE

01:35:50.978 --> 01:35:52.446
MINING INDUSTRY.

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:54.315
AND IT IS EMINENTLY SENSIBLE

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:56.117
THAT WE DO THE SAME WITH THE

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:57.985
SECTOR WITH A FOOTPRINT IN

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:00.020
LITERALLY EVERY CORNEROF THE

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:01.088
STATE.

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:02.857
RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.792
TAKEN IN APPROPRIATIONS FURTHER

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:07.061
CLARIFY DOGGER MAY DEVELOP A

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:08.729
STANDARD MODEL SO THAT IT

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:11.232
DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL.

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:13.634
INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENTS FOR

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:16.837
EACH CATEGORY OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:18.272
AND THE DOCTOR CAN MAKE ITS BEST

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:20.841
ESTIMATES AS TO THE LIFETIME OF

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:21.742
CURRENTLY PRODUCING

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.077
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:25.212
I WANT THIS MCHANISM TO BE BOTH

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.981
USEFUL FOR THE PUBLIC AND

SO THAT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:37.124

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:42.630

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:45.399
THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.334

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:52.406
THIS ITEM [inaudible]

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:58.379
KNOW.

01:36:58.445 --> 01:37:00.614
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO UNDER THE

01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:03.517
LEADERSHIP OF SPEAKER PEREZ.

01:37:03.584 --> 01:37:05.920
OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:07.354
SIGNED A LAW.

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.256
CALLED RIGS TO REEFS.

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:12.459
THE BASIC PREMISE BEHIND THE LAW.

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:14.595
WAS THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.530
OFFSHORE WELLS.

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:18.065
AND THAT IF INSTEAD OF SOME OF

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:19.800
THOSE WELLS AS TALL AS A

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:21.535
THOUSAND FEET GOING DOWN TO THE

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.270
DEPTHS OF THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN.

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:26.407
AND INSTEAD OF ARM HAVING THOSE

01:37:26.473 --> 01:37:28.008
WELLS JUST BE REMOVED AS THE

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:30.611
REQUIRED UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW.

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.246
IF THERE'S A NET ENVIRONMENTAL

01:37:32.313 --> 01:37:33.581
BENEFIT.

01:37:33.647 --> 01:37:35.649
THE NOTION WAS YOU CAN CHOP IT

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:36.984
OFF AT A HUNDRED FEATURES ALL

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.552
SHIPS CAN GO OVER IT.

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:40.154
IT WOULD BE A RE FENCE RIGS TO

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:40.921
REEFS.

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:42.790
AND IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN

01:37:42.856 --> 01:37:44.024
THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.

01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:45.226
THERE WAS SOME CHALLENGES WITH

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:46.427
THAT AND FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:48.229
YEARS ON THIS FLOOR I HAVE BEEN

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:49.530
ARGUING.

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.098
FOR THIS IDEA OF THE RIGS TO

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:53.334
REEFS BECAUSE THE NOTION WAS

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.737
THAT THE MONEY SAVED. 80% 85% OF

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.806
THE MONEY BEING SAVED WOULD GO

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.241
INTO AND IN DOWN ONE FOR THE

01:38:00.307 --> 01:38:01.442
OCEAN.

01:38:01.508 --> 01:38:04.144
IT WOULD MAKE WE ESTIMATE.

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:06.480
OF FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ENDOWMENT

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:08.015
PROTECT THE OCEAN.

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:10.184
THE SINGLE LARGEST ENDOWMENT ON

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:11.752
PLANET EARTH TO PROTECT THE

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:12.653
OCEAN.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.455
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US AS WE

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.190
FACE CHALLENGES IN THIS BODY TO

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:17.224
PAY.

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:19.727
FOR OTHER THINGS EDUCATION

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:21.362
HEALTHCARE AND OTHER CHALLENGES

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:23.397
TO ALSO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT

01:38:23.464 --> 01:38:25.366
IN THE OCEAN THE WAY THIS WOULD

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:27.735
DO SO. TO THE BILL THAT I HAD

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:28.369
HAD TO MAKE IT IN THAT

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.204
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT IT HAS

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:32.039
BEEN QUITE CHALLENGING.

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:34.074
THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:36.443
IS THAT IT REQUIRES STARTED NOW

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.511
DO AN ASSESSMENT.

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:38.746
AS TO WHAT IT WOULD COST TO

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:40.080
REMOVE EACH OF THESE AS NOW IN

01:38:40.147 --> 01:38:42.049
ADDITION TO DOES OTHER PIPELINES

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.083
AND OTHER THINGS BUT I'M

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:43.851
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED THE

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:44.518
OFFSHORE.

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.920
OIL WELLS SO NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.522
LOOK AT A REAL ASSESSMENT AS TO

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:51.158
HOW MUCH MONEY COULD BE SAVED.

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.159
TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO THIS

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:53.761
IMPORTANT AND DOWN ONE FOR THE

01:38:53.827 --> 01:38:54.828
OCEAN.

01:38:54.895 --> 01:38:59.233
AGAINST THE ARM THE THE THE ANY

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.368
OTHERS ASSOCIATED COSTS AT INFO

01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:03.937
OF FOR OF COURSE ONLY IF THERE'S

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:05.472
AN THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT SO

01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:07.241

SEEING WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE SO

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:13.247
WE CAN QUANTIFY THE SAVINGS IN

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:14.682
THE BENEFIT TO THE OCEAN.

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:17.751

IMMEDIATELY.

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:04.538
SO THAT'S WHAT SB THREE THIRTY

01:44:04.605 --> 01:44:05.973
IS PATTERNED AFTER AND IN FACT I

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.941
ASKED BEFORE A SUBMITTED THE

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:10.177

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:21.922
PATTERNED AFTER THAT.

01:44:21.989 --> 01:44:25.592
SO IT RELIES ON OUR EXISTING

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:28.595
LOCAL ZONING AND IT TELLS OUR

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:31.064
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO WHAT YOU

01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:31.732
ARE DOING.

01:44:31.798 --> 01:44:33.667
BUT DO IT EFFECTIVELY DO IT

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:35.936
EFFICIENTLY AND DON'T CHANGE THE

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:38.238
RULES MIDSTREAM SO ONCE A

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.773

EXISTING DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS.

01:44:45.746 --> 01:44:47.114
AND ONCE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:49.016
SAYS YOUR APPLICATION IS

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:52.586

PROCESS THE PERMIT ANY YEAR.

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.822
AND IT LIMITS THE NUMBER OF

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:58.525
PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT TO TO UP TO

01:44:58.592 --> 01:45:00.394
SIX IT STILL ALLOWS FOR UP TO

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.095
SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS AND IT SAYS

01:45:02.162 --> 01:45:03.497

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:05.232
IN ONE YEAR AND THEN DURING THAT

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:08.969
YEAR DO NOT CHANGE THE RULES

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:10.570

DON'T CHANGE OTHER RULES THAT

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.574
WAY THE APPLICANT KNOWS THERE'S

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:15.776
CONSISTENCY.

01:45:15.842 --> 01:45:17.477
THIS HELPS REDUCE THE COST OF

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:20.447
HOUSING BECAUSE TIME IS MONEY.

01:45:20.514 --> 01:45:21.882
SO WHAT SB THREE THIRTY DOES IT

01:45:21.948 --> 01:45:23.483
TAKE KNOWLEDGE THAT UP AND DOWN

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.619

LACK OF A BETTER TERM DEBT TO

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.101
SOCIETY.

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:16.469
AND IF IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:18.604
CONTINUE TO ON THE BACKS OF

01:56:18.671 --> 01:56:21.140

CHARGING KNOWS BASED ON THEIR

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:32.952
INABILITY TO PAY.

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:34.821
WELL THAT'S ALREADY IN THE LAW

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:35.355
AND APPARENTLY DOESN'T GET

01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:37.957
IMPLEMENTED. FOR MORE COALITION

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:39.092
THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS

01:56:39.158 --> 01:56:40.993
AND CONVERSATIONS THAT A TASK

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:44.063
FORCE MEETING. ONE TOWNS

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.132
COALITION MEMBER ASK A PROBATION

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:49.669

AND THE PROBATION CHIEF ADMITTED

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:52.605
THAT THEY REALLY DON'T DO THE

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:53.940
ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION IN

01:56:54.006 --> 01:56:55.108
THEIR COUNTY.

01:56:55.174 --> 01:56:56.676
THEY JUST CHARGE EVERYONE AND

01:56:56.743 --> 01:56:58.444
ATTEMPT TO LET THEIR COLLECTION

01:56:58.511 --> 01:57:01.514
AGENCY DEAL WITH COLLECTIONS.

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.415
BECAUSE THE COLLECTION RATE IS

01:57:02.482 --> 01:57:05.151
SO LOW THE AMOUNT THE COUNTY

01:57:05.218 --> 01:57:06.152
SPENDS AND COLLECTING THESE FEES

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:07.920
IS THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART.

01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:09.922
OF WHAT'S COLLECTED TRULY

01:57:09.989 --> 01:57:11.190
IMPLEMENTING ABILITY TO PAY

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:12.558
WOULD JUST INCREASE THE ADMIN

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:14.794
COSTS AND SINCE WE KNOW MOST

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:16.729
PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY WOULD

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:21.234
BE SPENDING MORE PUBLIC DOLLARS --

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.468
TO ATTEMPT TO FIND A NEEDLE IN

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:25.037

FOR MOST COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AND

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.679

01:57:44.223 --> 01:57:44.791
THANK YOU MUCH IS THE PRESIDENT

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:44.957
SO.

01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:46.626
I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS

01:57:46.692 --> 01:57:48.227
MEASURE.

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:49.729
AND I START WITH THE BASIS OF

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:52.165
WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE.

01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:54.100
AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE

01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:56.102
LOST OUR WAY.

01:57:56.169 --> 01:57:58.971
WHEN YOU STUDY THE REASONS FOR

01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:00.673
PUNISHMENT WHEN PEOPLE VIOLATE

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:02.275
THE LAW?

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:03.776
WHETHER IT IS TAKING AWAY THEIR

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:06.946
LIBERTY OR IMPOSING A FINE.

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.548
THE PURPOSE OF THE FINE.

01:58:08.614 --> 01:58:11.451
IS TO PUNISH FOR DEFENSE.

01:58:11.517 --> 01:58:13.186
THAT'S ITS PURPOSE.

01:58:13.252 --> 01:58:14.954
THAT'S WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY WERE

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:16.989
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT.

01:58:17.056 --> 01:58:18.958
BUT WE HAVE LOST OUR WAY.

01:58:19.025 --> 01:58:21.027
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

01:58:21.093 --> 01:58:22.662

01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:24.764
UNDER OUR CODE IF YOU BOUGHT A

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:30.203
DOLLARS.

01:58:30.269 --> 01:58:32.472
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE HAVE

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:35.308
USED THESE PROCESSES TO

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:37.677

DOLLARS. TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:02.969
EIGHT DOLLARS.

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:05.171
THE TEST IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT

01:59:05.238 --> 01:59:07.173
WE'RE PUNISHING PEOPLE BUT TO BE

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:10.476

PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WE HEARD

01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:44.977
ABOUT.

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.879
THE SYSTEM DOESN'T MAKE ANY

01:59:46.946 --> 01:59:49.849
SENSE IT'S GONE AMOK WE HAVE

01:59:49.916 --> 01:59:51.551

01:59:55.021 --> 01:59:56.322
THE DECISION OF THE COURT WHERE

01:59:56.389 --> 01:59:57.290

FAILS TO FURTHER THE LEGISLATIVE

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:09.201

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:10.937
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND I WOULD

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:12.738
SUGGEST IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:14.774
I UNDERSTAND THAT GOVERNMENT

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.475
NEEDS MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS BUT

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:18.144

02:01:43.396 --> 02:01:45.131

THINK IT'S NOT A ZERO SUM GAME

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:44.964
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:50.102

CONSTITUENT.

02:07:07.086 --> 02:07:09.655
AND IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR SYSTEM

02:07:09.722 --> 02:07:13.125
NEEDS REHABILITATION. FIVE FOUR

02:07:13.192 --> 02:07:15.227
YEARS OF ASSESSING FEES EXCEPT

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:16.895

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:26.572
TO THIS.

02:07:26.638 --> 02:07:29.208
THEN WE HAVE SYSTEMATIC CHANGES

02:07:29.274 --> 02:07:30.376
WE HAVE TO MAKE.

02:07:30.442 --> 02:07:31.543
I WAS THRILLED TO HEAR THAT MY

02:07:31.610 --> 02:07:33.112
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WAS

02:07:33.178 --> 02:07:35.114

YOUNG MEN OF COLOR.

02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:42.521
WHO HAD SERVED HIS TIME IN

02:07:42.588 --> 02:07:45.758
PRISON -- FOR A VERY LOW LEVEL

02:07:45.824 --> 02:07:47.726
OFFENSE BUT HE WAS IN PRISON.

02:07:47.793 --> 02:07:48.794
AND SINCE.

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:50.329
HE DIDN'T HAVE A VERY GOOD

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:51.597
BEGINNING IN LIFE WHICH HE

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:53.265
DIDN'T EXACTLY WANT TO HAVE TO

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:55.267
SHARE WITH THE WORLD.

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:56.769
BUT HE HAD GOTTEN OUT OF PRISON.

02:07:56.835 --> 02:07:59.705
HE HAD HAS A FULL TIME JOB.

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:02.141
BUT HE NEEDS HIS GED SO WE HAD

02:08:02.207 --> 02:08:03.675
SENT HIM OFF TO THE COMMUNITY

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:06.245
COLLEGE AND AN APPRENTICESHIP

02:08:06.311 --> 02:08:07.646

02:08:07.713 --> 02:08:10.616
WHO WAS HOLDING A SLOT FOR HIM?

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.084
IN ORDER FOR HIM AS HE GOT HIS

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:14.153

INTO THIS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.

02:08:16.088 --> 02:08:19.024
AND HIS HIS SALARY WOULD TRIPLE.

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.959
YOUNG MAN WITH A FIANCE WHOSE

02:08:21.026 --> 02:08:22.728
FAMILY HAD EMBRACED HIM SO WE

02:08:22.795 --> 02:08:23.929

FIANCE HERE'S A YOUNG MAN WHO

02:08:33.939 --> 02:08:36.508
WAS EXCITED ABOUT LIFE?

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:39.011
AND THEN THE BILL CAME.

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:41.447
FROM -- CORRECTIONS AND FROM THE

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:43.816
FERRET FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.184
HIS WAGES WERE GARNISHED.

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:46.819
HE COULD NO LONGER GO TO THE G.

02:08:46.885 --> 02:08:49.755
D. PROGRAM AT NIGHT AT ECC.

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:51.790
BECAUSE HE HAD TO WORK DOUBLE.

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:52.724
BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO HAVE HIS

02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:54.860
WAGES GARNISHED AND HE COULDN'T

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:56.595
TAKE CARE OF HIS NEW FAMILY.

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:57.963
AND HE WAS A SHAME BECAUSE NOW

02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:59.898
HE HAD TO ADMIT. TO HIS NEW

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:02.701

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:06.939
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:08.607
AND THEN OF COURSE WE CHECKED

02:09:08.674 --> 02:09:10.476
INTO THE SYSTEM TO SEE COULD WE

02:09:10.542 --> 02:09:12.344

CONSTITUENTS SERVICES CAPACITY.

02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:16.648
THAT THE FEES WOULD BE STRETCHED

02:09:16.715 --> 02:09:18.817
OUT AND HE COULD PAY LESS OVER A

02:09:18.884 --> 02:09:19.852
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

02:09:19.918 --> 02:09:22.554
TURNS OUT THEY OWED HIM MONEY.

02:09:22.621 --> 02:09:24.289
LOWER.

02:09:24.356 --> 02:09:24.890
BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN ASSESSED

02:09:24.957 --> 02:09:28.093
WRONG BUT IT TOOK US INTERVENING

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:30.195

HE WAS AFRAID TO SPEND.

02:09:50.516 --> 02:09:52.484
BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID.

02:09:52.551 --> 02:09:54.319

SO.

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:02.561
I BELIEVE IN THIS BILL BECAUSE I

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:04.696
THINK IT FORCES US TO REALLY

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:06.865
FACE SOME FACTS AND CORRECT SOME

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.433
SITUATIONS THAT WE WERE IN

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.102
BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY PROBLEMS I

02:10:10.169 --> 02:10:11.870
GET IT.

02:10:11.937 --> 02:10:13.105
BUT NOW IT'S UP TO US TO FIGURE

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:15.073

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:26.318
AND THAT HE CAN GET HIS GED AND

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:27.152

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:46.891
IT'S APPROPRIATE.

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:49.094
HAVE WE ABUSE HAVE A HAS OUR

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.563
SYSTEM ABUSED THE FINES AND FEES

02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:53.398
STRUCTURE AS A MEANS OF

02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:56.801
SUPPLANTING LOST REVENUE -- FROM

02:17:56.868 --> 02:17:58.203
THE STATE IN ELSEWHERE.

02:17:58.269 --> 02:18:00.438
ON THE FLIP SIDE -- I'M

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:01.806
CONCERNED THAT CERTAIN COUNTIES

02:18:01.873 --> 02:18:05.477
MIGHT BE -- HARMED IN THE

02:18:05.543 --> 02:18:07.846
PROCESS IN TERMS OF PROVIDING --

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:10.882
FUNCTIONS AND SERVICES THAT WE

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:11.416
HEARD FROM THE CENTER FROM

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:12.550
SACRAMENTO.

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:13.318
SO BUT I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:15.153
THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:17.188
PRESENTS A QUESTION.

02:18:17.255 --> 02:18:18.923
BUT DOESN'T ANSWER IT.

02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:20.225
EVEN THOUGH I THINK THERE'S A

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:21.760
LOT OF MERIT.

02:18:21.826 --> 02:18:23.962
IN WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED.

02:18:24.029 --> 02:18:25.463
ULTIMATELY IF IT IS COST

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:27.098
INEFFECTIVE.

02:18:27.165 --> 02:18:28.933
BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT VERSES

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.736
THE RATE OF COLLECTION.

02:18:31.803 --> 02:18:33.705
WOULD IT NOT BE HELPFUL FOR ALL

02:18:33.772 --> 02:18:34.639
OF US TO HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

02:18:34.706 --> 02:18:36.207
COUNTIES.

02:18:36.274 --> 02:18:37.676
PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION BEFORE

02:18:37.742 --> 02:18:39.711
WE MOVE FORWARD.

02:18:39.778 --> 02:18:42.213
AND ULTIMATELY ALSO LEAVE IT UP

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:42.914
TO THE DISCRETION OF THE

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:43.748
COUNTIES.

02:18:43.815 --> 02:18:45.383
BECAUSE THERE'S A MERITORIOUS

02:18:45.450 --> 02:18:46.951
PROGRAMS IN THERE THERE'S

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:49.888
THERE'S A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:51.523
FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED AT

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:53.458
CERTAIN CERTAIN COUNTIES PUBLIC

02:18:53.525 --> 02:18:55.593
DEFENDER FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED.

02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.595
SO I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT

02:18:57.662 --> 02:19:00.699
TRACK I WAS WONDERING -- IF THIS

02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:02.734
MIGHT BE BE MORE HELPFUL TO WIN

02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:04.302
THROUGH A JOINT AUDIT.

02:19:04.369 --> 02:19:05.804
OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:08.773
THEN CAME BACK WITH A COMPLETE

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:11.142
ASSESSMENT -- BUT WITH THAT I

02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:12.577
THINK -- I'LL PROBABLY ESTáN

02:19:12.644 --> 02:19:13.978
LAY OFF ON THIS BUT THAT'S WHERE

02:19:14.045 --> 02:19:15.513
I THINK HE WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL

02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:17.415
FOR THIS TO GO.

02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:18.349

WHICH IS THAT THIS IS A VERY

02:19:51.316 --> 02:19:53.251
COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF FEES.

02:19:53.318 --> 02:19:57.288
THEY ALL HAVE THEIR INTRICACIES --

02:19:57.355 --> 02:20:00.625
AND PURPOSES -- AND THAT THERE

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:02.727

IN ANY NUMBER OF VENUES OVER THE

02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:19.797
YEARS TO COME FORWARD WITH THEIR

02:22:19.864 --> 02:22:21.566
TRUE NUMBERS I WOULD JUST DIRECT

02:22:21.633 --> 02:22:22.867
MY COLLEAGUES ATTENTION TO AT

02:22:22.934 --> 02:22:25.103
LEAST JUST THREE REPORTS THAT I

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.504
HAPPEN TO HAVE YOUR IN MY BINDER.

FEES HIGH PAIN FOR PEOPLE LOW

02:22:29.507 --> 02:22:31.943
GAME FOR GOVERNMENT A CALL TO

02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:33.344
ACTION FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES.

02:22:33.411 --> 02:22:34.679
PRODUCED BY THE FINANCIAL

02:22:34.746 --> 02:22:36.247
JUSTICE PROJECT OUT OF SAN

PROBATION THE STUDY THE ECONOMIC

02:22:39.984 --> 02:22:41.920
AND RACIAL IMPACT OF PROBATION

FEES OF CUT IN CALIFORNIA --

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:46.891
PUBLISHED BY A AT THE HARVARD

02:22:46.958 --> 02:22:48.626
KENNEDY SCHOOL AND IMPROVING

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:50.328
CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL FINE IN

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:52.330
FEES SYSTEM THE REPORT BY THE

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:53.865
LEAD GENTLEST AND SO I THINK

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:56.200
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT A GREAT DEAL

02:22:56.267 --> 02:22:58.469
OF THOUGHT LEADERS HAVE A PUT

02:22:58.536 --> 02:23:01.005
THEIR MIND TO REALLY TRY.

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:05.510
TO ON WIND -- A PROCESS THAT WE

02:23:05.576 --> 02:23:09.314
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WE HELP

02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:10.848
FACILITATE.

02:23:10.915 --> 02:23:11.616
BECAUSE OF A STRUGGLING ECONOMY

02:23:11.683 --> 02:23:12.951
BECAUSE OF A STRUGGLING GENERAL

02:23:13.017 --> 02:23:16.955
FUND -- THIS WAS THE WAY TO

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:19.557
CONTINUE TO FIND GOOD WORK.

02:23:19.624 --> 02:23:20.458
AND THE QUESTION IS IS IT

02:23:20.525 --> 02:23:22.460
FUNDING GOOD WORK THE QUESTION

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:23.594
IS WHAT IS IT FUNDING.

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:25.663
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE DON'T

02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:26.664
KNOW.

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.466
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE COUNTIES

02:23:28.533 --> 02:23:29.233
IN THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.102
SERVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:23:31.169 --> 02:23:33.237
COME FORWARD TO PROVIDE CLARITY

02:23:33.304 --> 02:23:35.106
AND THEY HAVE NOT.

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:37.108
AND SO PERHAPS THE SUIT COULD BE

02:23:37.175 --> 02:23:38.743
PERCEIVED AS THE STICK APPROACH

02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:39.444
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT'S

02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:41.679
NECESSARY FOR US TO REALLY GET

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:43.815
DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY IF YOU

02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:44.015
WILL.

02:23:44.082 --> 02:23:46.250
IN DETERMINING HOW COUNTIES ARE

02:23:46.317 --> 02:23:47.885
USING THESE DOLLARS PAID ON THE

02:23:47.952 --> 02:23:52.156
BACKS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- BEEN

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:54.225
SUBJUGATED TO OUR CRIMINAL

02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:55.626
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:23:55.693 --> 02:23:58.029
AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I THE THE

02:23:58.096 --> 02:23:59.197
POINT OF THE BILL IN THE POINT

02:23:59.263 --> 02:24:01.332
OF ME ASKING YOU TO CONTINUE IT

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:03.234
THE MOVE TO THE PROCESS I AM

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:04.602
SURE IT WILL BE AMENDED IN THE

02:24:04.669 --> 02:24:06.037
ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL GIVE ME THE

02:24:06.104 --> 02:24:07.138
OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK.

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:08.473
AND WE CAN HAVE A FULL

02:24:08.539 --> 02:24:10.375
DISCUSSION IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:11.843
IN THE COMEBACKS COMES BACK

02:24:11.909 --> 02:24:13.244

02:24:17.081 --> 02:24:17.915
THE PROCESS.

02:24:17.982 --> 02:24:19.650
I'M CLEAR ABOUT THE QUESTION

02:24:19.717 --> 02:24:21.786
AROUND THE INTERLOCK AT THE

02:24:21.853 --> 02:24:23.388

02:44:50.313 --> 02:44:52.682
HANDS.

02:44:52.749 --> 02:44:54.150
FOLKS MAY KNOW THAT CHINA HAS

02:44:54.217 --> 02:44:55.919
JUST IMPLEMENTED.

02:44:55.986 --> 02:44:57.954
THE NATIONAL SORT POLICY.

02:44:58.021 --> 02:44:59.022
WHICH I A DECISION IT'S NOW

02:44:59.089 --> 02:45:00.190
BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER ASIAN

02:45:00.257 --> 02:45:02.158
NATIONS. TO NO LONGER ACCEPT OUR

02:45:02.225 --> 02:45:03.960
RECYCLING.

02:45:04.027 --> 02:45:05.695
WHEN THAT HAS SINGLE HANDEDLY

02:45:05.762 --> 02:45:07.464
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM TO FALL OUT

02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:08.865
ON A RECYCLING MARKETS?

02:45:08.932 --> 02:45:10.867
IT'S COSTING CITIES AND COUNTIES

02:45:10.934 --> 02:45:12.535
RIGHT HERE IN CITY CALIFORNIA.

02:45:12.602 --> 02:45:13.169
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE

02:45:13.236 --> 02:45:14.471
YEAR.

02:45:14.537 --> 02:45:15.272
SO IT TURNED OUT THAT IN THE

02:45:15.338 --> 02:45:17.774
PAST.

02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:19.075
CHINA HAD BEEN ACCEPTING.

02:45:19.142 --> 02:45:20.944
40% RECYCLABLE MATERIAL FROM THE

02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:21.444
U. S..

02:45:21.511 --> 02:45:24.314
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:45:24.381 --> 02:45:25.915
THE CALIFORNIA THAT RATE WAS AT

02:45:25.982 --> 02:45:27.951
56%.

02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:30.620
SO HAD MORE OVER HALF MAJORITY

02:45:30.687 --> 02:45:31.755
ARE CYCLE MATERIALS GOING.

02:45:31.821 --> 02:45:33.857
OFF THE CHINA.

02:45:33.923 --> 02:45:35.392
AND OF COURSE-- AT THE TIME

02:45:35.458 --> 02:45:36.693
ACCORDING TO OUR YCLES DATA

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:38.395
NUMBERS THREE THROUGH SEVEN OF

02:45:38.461 --> 02:45:39.996
OF RECYCLED.

02:45:40.063 --> 02:45:41.898
PLASTICS WERE FETCHING ABOUT

02:45:41.965 --> 02:45:44.701
TWENTY DOLLARS PER TON IN.

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:45.235
TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW LOCAL

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:46.636
JURISDICTIONS ARE PAYING ROUGHLY

02:45:46.703 --> 02:45:47.637
TEN DOLLARS A TON TO DISPOSE OF

02:45:47.704 --> 02:45:49.306
IT.

02:45:49.372 --> 02:45:50.206
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TO PAY

02:45:50.273 --> 02:45:51.541
PEOPLE IT USED TO BE A REVENUE

02:45:51.608 --> 02:45:53.310
GENERATOR OUR CITIES AND

02:45:55.712 --> 02:45:57.347
MATERIAL.

02:45:57.414 --> 02:45:59.082
SO AS A RESULT MORE MORE OFTEN

02:45:59.149 --> 02:46:00.383
THAT MEANS THE MATERIAL IS BEING

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:01.785
LANDFILLS.

02:46:01.851 --> 02:46:03.586

02:46:04.587 --> 02:46:06.122
BINS.

02:46:06.189 --> 02:46:07.791
THE MATERIAL IS LESS LIKELY TO

02:46:07.857 --> 02:46:09.893
BE PROCESSED RECYCLED NOW.

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:10.794
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS

02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:12.862
UNSUSTAINABLE AND I I JUST ASK

02:50:23.546 --> 02:50:24.614
FOUR YEARS I SERVED ON MY SOLID

02:50:24.681 --> 02:50:27.016
WASTE -- A REGIONAL BOARD -- IN

02:50:27.083 --> 02:50:29.285
MY NECK OF THE WOODS I AND MANY

02:50:29.352 --> 02:50:31.020
OF YOU RECALL THAT LAST YEAR I

02:50:31.087 --> 02:50:32.755
KERRY LEGISLATION TO TRY TO

02:50:32.822 --> 02:50:35.325
PATCHWORK OUR SYSTEM OF SOLID

02:50:35.391 --> 02:50:36.459
WASTE AND RECYCLING THAT IS

02:50:36.526 --> 02:50:37.727
DETERIORATING.

02:50:37.794 --> 02:50:40.697
I AS THE AUTHOR THIS BILL IS SO

02:50:40.763 --> 02:50:42.365
CORRECTLY DESCRIBED.

02:50:42.432 --> 02:50:43.433
OF AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE

02:50:43.499 --> 02:50:44.400
SOME ISSUES WITH THE LEGISLATION

02:50:44.467 --> 02:50:45.735
THAT'S BEFORE US.

02:50:45.802 --> 02:50:47.036
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR'S

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:48.571
INTENTIONS ARE GOOD ONES AND I

02:50:48.638 --> 02:50:50.473
THINK HIS BILL IS HEADING IN THE

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:52.108
RIGHT DIRECTION AND SO I'M GOING

02:50:52.175 --> 02:50:53.242
TO SUPPORT IT TODAY.

02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:54.744
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S THE THING WE

02:50:54.811 --> 02:50:56.679
HAVE TO DO -- THIS IS A SERIOUS

02:50:56.746 --> 02:50:59.248
PROBLEM -- WE HAVE TO GET IN

02:50:59.315 --> 02:51:00.550
FRONT OF IT WE CAN'T IGNORE IT.

02:51:00.617 --> 02:51:01.818
AND I THINK THAT'S THE INTENTION

02:51:01.884 --> 02:51:03.453
OF THIS THE AUTHOR FROM SANTA

02:51:03.519 --> 02:51:04.120
MONICA.

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:06.222
AND IT'S WHY I WANTED TO ADVANCE

02:51:06.289 --> 02:51:07.123
IT IN CONTINUE THOSE

02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:08.891
CONVERSATIONS BUT THERE ARE TWO

02:51:08.958 --> 02:51:09.993
ISSUES THAT I THINK DESERVE

02:51:10.059 --> 02:51:11.894
ATTENTION AS THAT WORK AT AND

02:51:11.961 --> 02:51:14.597
THAT -- THAT -- COMMUNICATION --

02:51:14.664 --> 02:51:15.732
WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS

02:51:15.798 --> 02:51:16.866
CONTINUES.

02:51:16.933 --> 02:51:18.801
THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE NOT

02:51:18.868 --> 02:51:20.370
BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO

02:51:20.436 --> 02:51:22.672
RECYCLE -- LIKE THIS BILL WOULD

02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:25.341
POTENTIALLY REQUIRE AND THAT'S A

02:51:25.408 --> 02:51:27.210
VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION --

02:51:27.276 --> 02:51:28.511
BUT THERE'S A REASON THAT WE

02:51:28.578 --> 02:51:29.912
CAN'T RECYCLE LOT OF PLASTICS

02:51:29.979 --> 02:51:32.315
HERE I IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS --

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:33.349
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:34.150
TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THE

02:51:34.217 --> 02:51:35.952
MACHINERY AND AND ALL THE

02:51:36.019 --> 02:51:37.520
ELEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR

02:51:37.587 --> 02:51:38.287
THAT SO.

02:51:38.354 --> 02:51:40.189
AS WE LOOK TO THESE -- HIGH

02:51:40.256 --> 02:51:41.624
POLLUTING PLASTICS SINGLE USE

02:51:41.691 --> 02:51:43.459
PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:44.160
HAVE TO FIND A WAY IF WE'RE

02:51:44.227 --> 02:51:45.161
GONNA SAY.

02:51:45.228 --> 02:51:46.562
YOU GOT TO RECYCLE IT THERE HAS

02:51:46.629 --> 02:51:48.164
TO BE ABLE AWAY -- PURSES TO

02:51:48.231 --> 02:51:52.602
SHIPPING IT AND A CONTAINER TO

02:51:52.669 --> 02:51:54.604
ANOTHER COUNTRY -- AND SECONDLY.

02:51:54.671 --> 02:51:56.272
I AM SKEPTICAL ABOUT SENDING ALL

02:51:56.339 --> 02:51:58.074
THIS DECISION MAKING TO A STATE

02:51:58.141 --> 02:52:00.076
AGENCY TO A STATE BUREAUCRACY

02:52:00.143 --> 02:52:01.711
YES WE HAVE POLITICS ON THI

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:03.312
FLOOR IT DOES AFFECT THE CHOICES

02:52:03.379 --> 02:52:06.015
THAT WE MAKE -- BUT THEY'RE ALSO

02:52:06.082 --> 02:52:07.383
POLITICS IN THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:09.585
AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY

02:52:09.652 --> 02:52:11.554
WAY TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF

02:52:11.621 --> 02:52:12.922
ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE CHOICES

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:14.390
THAT THEY THEY NEED TO MAKE

02:52:14.457 --> 02:52:15.692
GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE

02:52:15.758 --> 02:52:17.360
SINGLE USE RECYCLED PRODUCTS SO

02:52:17.427 --> 02:52:19.028
I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR IS NEAR

02:52:19.095 --> 02:52:21.297
THE BILL IN THE RIGHT WAY. TO

02:52:21.364 --> 02:52:22.598
FOCUS ON THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS.

02:52:22.665 --> 02:52:23.866
BUT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME

02:52:23.933 --> 02:52:25.702
AND BOUNCE THAT WE CAN EXERCISE

02:52:25.768 --> 02:52:28.538
AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURESO

02:52:28.604 --> 02:52:29.138
I ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR IN HIS

02:52:29.205 --> 02:52:30.807
GOOD WORK. TO LOOK FOR WAYS IN

02:52:30.873 --> 02:52:33.276
WHICH WE CAN -- ADVANCE THE

02:52:33.342 --> 02:52:34.744
IMPORTANT GOALS BUT STILL

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:36.212
PROVIDE A LEGISLATIVE ROLE

02:52:36.279 --> 02:52:38.214
THAT'S IMPORTANT I IN THIS IN

02:52:38.281 --> 02:52:39.782
THIS AREA SO WITH THAT I WOULD

02:52:39.849 --> 02:52:40.783
URGE EIGHT AND I'VE.

02:52:40.850 --> 02:52:42.218
THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER

02:52:42.285 --> 02:52:44.921
SKINNER.

02:52:44.987 --> 02:52:46.489
THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT

02:52:46.556 --> 02:52:48.491
AND A MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT

02:52:48.558 --> 02:52:49.425
OF THIS BILL.

02:52:49.492 --> 02:52:52.595
AND WHILE THE BILL IS TITLED IN --

02:52:52.662 --> 02:52:55.231
PLASTICS AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY.

02:52:55.298 --> 02:52:58.267
THE ERRANT BY OBVIOUSLY M.

02:52:58.334 --> 02:53:00.470
SOMEONE WHO IS FEELS VERY

02:53:00.536 --> 02:53:02.338
STRONGLY ABOUT PROTECTING OUR

02:53:02.405 --> 02:53:03.906
MARINE ENVIRONMENTS.

02:53:03.973 --> 02:53:05.374
AND SUCH FROM THIS TYPE OF

02:53:05.441 --> 02:53:07.009
POLLUTION THE REASON THAT I'M

02:53:07.076 --> 02:53:08.845
REALLY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF

02:53:08.911 --> 02:53:11.881
THIS BILL IS BECAUSE WE ARE IN A

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:14.250
I'LL CALL IT A A GARBAGE CRISIS

02:53:14.317 --> 02:53:15.685
RIGHT NOW AND I SEE GARBAGE

02:53:15.752 --> 02:53:16.552
CRISIS.

02:53:16.619 --> 02:53:17.854
OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT CALL IT A

02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:21.924
RECYCLING CRISIS BUT WE SO MUCH

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:25.027
OF OUR INTO HIGHER WASTE.

02:53:25.094 --> 02:53:27.396
INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS

02:53:27.463 --> 02:53:30.900
DESIGNED [inaudible]

02:53:30.967 --> 02:53:31.901
TO IN FACT.

02:53:31.968 --> 02:53:34.670
IDENTIFY A LARGE STORE A LARGE

02:53:34.737 --> 02:53:36.806
PORTION OF WHAT WE OTHERWISE

02:53:36.873 --> 02:53:39.075
MIGHT CONSIDER THE WASTE STREAM

02:53:39.142 --> 02:53:41.110
TO BE RECYCLABLE MATERIALS

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:42.945
MATERIALS THAT WOULD.

02:53:43.012 --> 02:53:45.014
BE COLLECTED SEPARATELY AND THEN

02:53:45.081 --> 02:53:48.651
REMADE INTO A SECONDARY PRODUCT.

02:53:48.718 --> 02:53:52.088
NOW IN THE US UP UNTIL LIKE MUCH

02:53:52.155 --> 02:53:54.290
OF OUR MANUFACTURING YOU KNOW WE

02:53:54.357 --> 02:53:56.459
WE USED TO HAVE A RELATIVELY

02:53:56.526 --> 02:53:59.295
ROBUST -- SYSTEM OF

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:01.497
MANUFACTURERS WHO WOULD TAKE

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:04.033
THESE SECONDARY MATERIALS AND

02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:05.701
MAKE A NEW PRODUCT WE DON'T ANY

02:54:05.768 --> 02:54:08.538
LONGER THERE ARE VERY VERY FEW

02:54:08.604 --> 02:54:10.206
ANYWHERE IN THE US.

02:54:10.273 --> 02:54:11.974
THAT TAKE A MATERIAL AND

02:54:12.041 --> 02:54:13.876
REMANUFACTURING SO THAT MEANT

02:54:13.943 --> 02:54:15.178
THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE

02:54:15.244 --> 02:54:17.079
COLLECTED THAT WE DIDN'T PUT IN

02:54:17.146 --> 02:54:19.715
A LANDFILL OR DIDN'T COMPOST.

02:54:19.782 --> 02:54:22.051
HAD TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE ELSE

02:54:22.118 --> 02:54:25.755
PRIMARILY TO ASIA CHINA.

02:54:25.822 --> 02:54:27.857
AND SOMEWHAT INDIA AND THEY

02:54:27.924 --> 02:54:31.227
WOULD THEN TAKE THAT STUFF.

02:54:31.294 --> 02:54:33.262
AND TURN IT INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT.

02:54:33.329 --> 02:54:36.265
WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OTHER

02:54:36.332 --> 02:54:38.901
COUNTRIES DEVELOP A MIDDLE CLASS

02:54:38.968 --> 02:54:40.536
AS THIS HAPPENED IN CHINA AND

02:54:40.603 --> 02:54:42.405
ELSEWHERE IN ASIA.

02:54:42.471 --> 02:54:45.041
THEY START PRODUCING AS MUCH OF

02:54:45.107 --> 02:54:47.844
THESE BY PRODUCTS AS WE DO.

02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:51.314
SO THEY NO LONGER NEED TO

02:54:51.380 --> 02:54:52.882
PURCHASE OUR MATERIAL.

02:54:52.949 --> 02:54:55.318
THEY HAVE ENOUGH FOR THEIR OWN.

02:54:55.384 --> 02:54:56.886
SO THEY BASICALLY YOU KNOW

02:54:56.953 --> 02:54:58.287
WHETHER WE CALL IT CHINA SOARED

02:54:58.354 --> 02:54:59.755
WHETHER WE COULD SAY IT'S A

02:54:59.822 --> 02:55:01.123
REACTION TO TERRACE OR WHATEVER

02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:03.392
WHAT IT BASICALLY IS.

02:55:03.459 --> 02:55:05.661
IS THAT ALL OF THE SECONDARY

02:55:05.728 --> 02:55:08.097
MATERIALS MANUFACTURERS IN THOSE

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:09.699
COUNTRIES HAVE ENOUGH FOR THEIR

02:55:09.765 --> 02:55:13.102
OWN STUFF THEY DON'T NEED TO BUY

02:55:13.169 --> 02:55:14.871
IT FROM US.

02:55:14.937 --> 02:55:15.771
AND THAT'S WHAT WE IS SERIOUSLY

02:55:15.838 --> 02:55:16.939
HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO

02:55:17.006 --> 02:55:19.008
HAPPEN EVEN GREATER SO WE THINK

02:55:19.075 --> 02:55:20.376
IT'S BAD RIGHT NOW.

02:55:20.443 --> 02:55:23.880
WITHIN A CERTAIN CITY YEARS AS

02:55:23.946 --> 02:55:25.648
OTHER ECONOMIES DEVELOP MORE AND

02:55:25.715 --> 02:55:28.317
MORE MIDDLE CLASS.

02:55:28.384 --> 02:55:29.285
AND THEY KNOW.

02:55:29.352 --> 02:55:31.354
PRODUCE MORE IT'S A LUXURY TO

02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:33.522
PRODUCE WASTE PRODUCE MORE WASTE

02:55:33.589 --> 02:55:35.491
OR QUOTE UNQUOTE RECYCLABLES

02:55:35.558 --> 02:55:37.894
THEY WILL HAVE NO INTEREST IN

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:39.328
PURCHASING HOURS.

02:55:39.395 --> 02:55:41.497
AND WHAT WERE ALREADY SEEN WITH

02:55:41.564 --> 02:55:44.066
THIS COLLAPSE OF MARKETS IS THAT

02:55:44.133 --> 02:55:45.868
WHETHER IT'S OUR HAULER WASTE

02:55:45.935 --> 02:55:48.204
MANAGEMENT OR REPUBLIC SERVICES

02:55:48.271 --> 02:55:51.073
OR RECOLOGY OR WHETHER WE HAVE

02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:52.642
SOME OF THE COMMUNITY BASED

02:55:52.708 --> 02:55:54.610
HOLLERS WHICH EXIST IN LOTS OF

02:55:54.677 --> 02:55:56.379
COMMUNITIES WHETHER SAN DIEGO.

02:55:56.445 --> 02:55:58.381
OR ALAMEDA COUNTY CONTRA COSTA

02:55:58.447 --> 02:55:59.248
COUNTY.

02:55:59.315 --> 02:56:02.018
THEY ARE TAKING THEIR MATERIALS

02:56:02.084 --> 02:56:04.153
TO THE PROCESSOR WHO BAILS AND

02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:07.223
SUCH AND THEN IT SITS.

02:56:07.290 --> 02:56:09.792
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A MARKET

02:56:09.859 --> 02:56:10.293
THEY CAN'T SELL.

02:56:10.359 --> 02:56:12.662
SO WE NEED TO GO BACK

02:56:12.728 --> 02:56:12.962
[inaudible]

02:56:13.029 --> 02:56:15.131
TO PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY.

02:56:15.197 --> 02:56:17.867
GET BACK HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:56:17.934 --> 02:56:20.770
MATERIALS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING

02:56:20.836 --> 02:56:22.805
TO BE ABLE TO RECYCLE BECAUSE

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:25.541
WHAT WE RELIED ON IS MARKETS

02:56:25.608 --> 02:56:27.310
DON'T EXIST ANYMORE.

02:56:27.376 --> 02:56:29.845
SO FROM A FROM A BUSINESS POINT

02:56:29.912 --> 02:56:31.781

REPAIR POINT OF VIEW AND WE TALK

RATE PAYERS.

02:56:35.851 --> 02:56:39.055
WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

02:56:39.121 --> 02:56:39.355
TO PROTECT.

02:56:39.422 --> 02:56:41.891
OUR REGULAR RATE PAYERS WHO PAID

02:56:41.958 --> 02:56:44.527
THEIR MONTHLY FEES FOR GARBAGE

02:56:44.593 --> 02:56:46.228
AND RECYCLING FROM HUGE

02:56:46.295 --> 02:56:48.331
INCREASES IN FEES UNLESS WE

02:56:48.397 --> 02:56:51.067
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIALS.

02:56:51.133 --> 02:56:53.803
THAT WE ARE EITHER PACKAGING TO

AND MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE.

03:04:38.467 --> 03:04:40.602
SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE

03:04:40.669 --> 03:04:42.971
HAVE STRENGTHENED OUR ALERTING

03:04:43.038 --> 03:04:45.441

PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS THE LEVEL

03:04:58.554 --> 03:04:59.822

FUTURE FIRE RISK.

03:05:06.028 --> 03:05:07.863
DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE

LOST OVER A HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS.

03:05:11.233 --> 03:05:13.469
TO THESE WILDFIRES AND IN MY

03:05:13.535 --> 03:05:15.370

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:26.181
WE HAD THE FIRES UP IN SANTA

03:05:26.248 --> 03:05:29.218

03:05:29.284 --> 03:05:32.855
LIVE IN A VERY PERILOUS TIME.

03:05:32.921 --> 03:05:34.756
DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

03:05:34.823 --> 03:05:37.159
FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING

03:05:37.226 --> 03:05:41.129
IN AREAS OF HIGH FILE YOUR RISK.

03:05:41.196 --> 03:05:44.032

IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S

03:07:42.751 --> 03:07:44.453
COMPLEX ENOUGH BRINGING THESE

03:07:44.519 --> 03:07:46.288
PEOPLE TO THE TABLE PEOPLE WHO

BUT FINDS BUILDING IN THAT AREA

03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:36.471
MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO THE

03:08:36.538 --> 03:08:38.373

CITIES TO REDUCE THEIR RINA --

03:11:19.568 --> 03:11:21.069
OBLIGATION OTHER HOUSING

03:11:21.136 --> 03:11:24.639
OBLIGATION -- BASED ON HAVING

03:11:24.706 --> 03:11:29.144
SOME WILD FIRE RISK IN THE CITY.

03:11:29.211 --> 03:11:30.478
HI THE AUTHOR AND I WE WORKED --

03:11:30.545 --> 03:11:31.313
BEFORE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE

03:11:31.379 --> 03:11:32.881
HEARING TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS

03:11:32.948 --> 03:11:35.050
ISSUE BECAUSE WHILE WE WANT TO

03:11:35.116 --> 03:11:36.651
REDUCE DEVELOPMENT PRESSURE IN

03:11:36.718 --> 03:11:39.855
AREAS AT HIGH RISK OF WILDFIRE --

03:11:39.921 --> 03:11:42.490
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT -- THAT

03:11:42.557 --> 03:11:44.426
CITIES NOT PUSH THEIR HOUSING

03:11:44.492 --> 03:11:47.195
OBLIGATIONS INTO OTHER CITIES --

03:11:47.262 --> 03:11:48.430
AND THAT IS A REAL ISSUE THAT WE

03:11:48.496 --> 03:11:51.833
SEE TODAY AND WE DON'T WANT TO

03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:52.634
EXACERBATE DOT.

03:11:52.701 --> 03:11:53.568
WE WERE UNABLE TO REACH

03:11:53.635 --> 03:11:55.203
AGREEMENT BY THE TIME OF THE

03:11:55.270 --> 03:11:57.138

INTENT PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE AND

03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:02.444
AND AGREED TO KEEP WORKING ON

03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:03.311
THE ISSUE.

03:12:03.378 --> 03:12:05.013
WE DID THAT IN EARNEST AND THE

03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:06.514
AUTHOR AND I HAD MULTIPLE

03:12:06.581 --> 03:12:07.849
CONVERSATIONS THAT OUR STAFF

03:12:07.916 --> 03:12:10.986
WORK TOGETHER -- AND WE CAME TO

03:12:11.052 --> 03:12:12.487
AN AGREEMENT.

03:12:12.554 --> 03:12:13.755
I AMENDMENTS -- THE AUTHOR

CROSSED AMENDMENTS LAST FRIDAY

03:12:15.423 --> 03:12:17.225
WE DID NOT SEE THOSE AMENDMENTS

03:12:17.292 --> 03:12:19.327
UNTIL AFTER THEY WERE CROSSED --

03:12:19.394 --> 03:12:21.129
DIED DO NOT FULLY REFLECT THE

03:12:21.196 --> 03:12:23.732
AGREEMENT -- WITH THE COMMITTEE --

03:12:23.798 --> 03:12:25.467
IN ADDITION THE AMENDMENTS ARE

03:12:25.533 --> 03:12:28.336
INTERNALLY -- CONTRADICTORY AND

03:12:28.403 --> 03:12:32.274
MY CONCERN WITH THE BILL AS IT

03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:33.708
STANDS NOW.

03:12:33.775 --> 03:12:36.177
IS IT PROVIDES THAT IF IF THE IF

03:12:36.244 --> 03:12:38.046
THE CITY HAS HI WILD FIRE RISK

03:12:38.113 --> 03:12:39.814
AREAS IN THAT CITY.

03:12:39.881 --> 03:12:41.583
AND IF THE PERCENTAGE OF LAND IN

03:12:41.650 --> 03:12:43.785
THE HIGH RISK ZONE IS ABOVE THE

03:12:43.852 --> 03:12:46.488
AVERAGE FOR THE ENTIRE REGION OR

03:12:46.554 --> 03:12:48.356
THE COG -- THE NIGHT CITY IS

03:12:48.423 --> 03:12:50.525
ELIGIBLE FOR A REDUCTION IN ITS

03:12:50.592 --> 03:12:52.527
RINA AND THAT RENO WILL THEN GET

03:12:52.594 --> 03:12:55.363
SHIFTED TO OTHER CITIES WITHIN

03:12:55.430 --> 03:12:56.364
THE COG.

03:12:56.431 --> 03:12:57.966
WELL IF YOU ARE A CITY LET'S SAY

03:12:58.033 --> 03:13:00.535
THE AVERAGE IN THE COG IS 10% IN

03:13:00.602 --> 03:13:02.337
A HIGH WILD VIRUS OWNS A NOT

03:13:02.404 --> 03:13:03.738
PARTICULARLY HIGH.

03:13:03.805 --> 03:13:06.241
AND YOU'RE A CITY THAT HAS 12%.

03:13:06.308 --> 03:13:07.709
YOUR THAN ELIGIBLE FOR REDUCTION

03:13:07.776 --> 03:13:10.845
EVEN THOUGH 88% OF YOUR LANDS.

03:13:10.912 --> 03:13:13.515
IS NOT AT HI WILD FIRE RISK.

03:13:13.581 --> 03:13:14.916
AND NOW WILL THEN GET

03:13:14.983 --> 03:13:16.518
DISTRIBUTED TO OTHER CITIES A

03:13:16.584 --> 03:13:19.187
RAISES SIGNIFICANT EQUITY ISSUES --

03:13:19.254 --> 03:13:20.622
AND I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT

03:13:20.689 --> 03:13:21.990
OUT BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE PATH

03:13:22.057 --> 03:13:23.925
OF THIS BILL I HAD HOPED TO BE

03:13:23.992 --> 03:13:25.727
ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY --

03:13:25.794 --> 03:13:27.062
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

03:13:27.128 --> 03:13:30.165
BILL REFLECTS OUR WHAT WE AGREED --

03:13:30.231 --> 03:13:33.101
TO AND IF THIS BILL MAKES IT

03:13:33.168 --> 03:13:34.302
OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY AND IF IT

03:13:34.369 --> 03:13:36.171
COMES BACK -- IF THESE ISSUES

03:13:36.237 --> 03:13:38.106
ARE RESOLVED -- I WILL OF COURSE

03:13:38.173 --> 03:13:39.908
RESERVE MY RIGHT -- TO PULL THE

03:13:39.975 --> 03:13:41.242

WERE NO BOUNDARIES IN PLACE.

03:16:08.890 --> 03:16:10.058
FAST FORWARD TO TWO YEARS AGO

03:16:10.125 --> 03:16:12.694

MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE DO BUILD

03:17:12.086 --> 03:17:14.155

03:17:38.713 --> 03:17:40.248
TO CONSENSUS.

03:17:40.315 --> 03:17:43.218
ISN'T PERFECT WILL IT BE PERFECT.

03:17:43.284 --> 03:17:46.321
PROBABLY NOT BUT IT IS NECESSARY

03:17:46.387 --> 03:17:48.056
THAT WE TAKE THE STEPS AND

03:17:48.122 --> 03:17:50.091
ALTHOUGH I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE

OUT BY AN NPR STORY THIS MORNING.

03:18:03.404 --> 03:18:05.073
THERE ARE SOME PLACES FRANKLY

03:18:05.139 --> 03:18:07.475
SIMPLY WHERE WE CHOSE SHOULD NOT

03:18:07.542 --> 03:18:08.810
BE BUILDING.

03:18:08.876 --> 03:18:11.446
AND WE SHOULD NOT BE REBUILDING.

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:13.114
AND I KNOW THE TENDENCY IN THE

03:18:13.181 --> 03:18:14.916
YOU'RE JUST FOR PEOPLE TO GET

03:18:14.983 --> 03:18:16.517

BUT PROTECTION IS AS IS AS

03:50:50.403 --> 03:50:52.972
IMPORTANT BECAUSE PRODUCTION IS

03:50:53.039 --> 03:50:54.840
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN FOR SEVERAL

03:50:54.907 --> 03:50:55.741

03:51:20.166 --> 03:51:22.568
THAT SHOULD NOT GET IN THE WAY

03:51:22.635 --> 03:51:25.037
OF PROTECTING TENANTS WHEN THEY

03:51:25.104 --> 03:51:26.973

THE WITH HOLDEN RENT AND SHE

03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:09.348
MADE A VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S

03:52:09.415 --> 03:52:10.750
NOT PART OF THIS BILL.

03:52:10.816 --> 03:52:12.718

03:52:20.960 --> 03:52:22.261
WE WE WE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE

03:52:22.328 --> 03:52:24.964
YESTERDAY -- I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW

03:52:25.031 --> 03:52:26.699
MUCH -- THE SENTIMENTS OF

03:52:26.766 --> 03:52:28.567
CHANGED.

03:52:28.634 --> 03:52:30.603
BUT ALL ABBREVIATE WHAT I'VE

03:52:30.670 --> 03:52:33.539
MENTIONED BEFORE -- MY CONCERN

03:52:33.606 --> 03:52:37.843
IS THAT THIS IS ONE STEP REMOVED

03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:39.679
FROM RENT CONTROL.

03:52:39.745 --> 03:52:40.780
WHICH THE VOTERS SOUNDLY

03:52:40.846 --> 03:52:43.883
REJECTED -- AT THE THE VOTING

03:52:43.949 --> 03:52:46.952
BOOTH -- IN THE REASON FOR THAT

03:52:47.019 --> 03:52:49.422
IS WHEN YOU.

03:52:49.488 --> 03:52:52.725
ARE CREATING A TENANT UNION IF

03:52:52.792 --> 03:52:54.460
YOU WILL OR SO SEE ATION.

03:52:54.527 --> 03:52:56.028
IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

03:52:56.095 --> 03:52:58.030
BEFORE THAT ORGANIZATION IS

03:52:58.097 --> 03:53:01.367
GOING TO COLLECTIVELY DEMANDS --

03:53:01.434 --> 03:53:03.302
A REDUCTION IN RENT.

03:53:03.369 --> 03:53:07.340
AND THAT IS ONE OF MY WHAT IS

03:53:07.406 --> 03:53:08.774
ONE OF MY ONE OF MY CONCERNS.

03:53:08.841 --> 03:53:10.242
AND I THINK I EXPRESS THAT TO

03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:12.111
YOU BEFORE BUT IT'S ALSO YOU

03:53:12.178 --> 03:53:13.012
KNOW VOTER INTEGRITY.

03:53:13.079 --> 03:53:16.282
WE WE'VE ALREADY VOTED IS IS A

03:53:16.349 --> 03:53:17.717
STATE ON THIS ISSUE RECENTLY.

03:53:17.783 --> 03:53:19.852
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

03:53:19.919 --> 03:53:21.654
THAT WAS -- REJECTED.

03:53:21.721 --> 03:53:23.689
BUT PROMOTE ANOTHER POINT WOULD

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:25.458
BEING.

03:53:25.524 --> 03:53:27.626
WE HAVING CREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

03:53:27.693 --> 03:53:29.595
TENANT PROTECTIONS.

03:53:29.662 --> 03:53:31.464
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:53:31.530 --> 03:53:32.898
I THINK THE NARRATIVE THAT HAS

03:53:32.965 --> 03:53:34.934
BEEN PUT OUT THERE IS THAT THERE

03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:37.570
IS A LIST.

03:53:37.636 --> 03:53:39.638
OF BAD LANDLORDS AND YES THERE

03:53:39.705 --> 03:53:41.540
ARE BAD LAND LANDLORDS IN FACT

03:53:41.607 --> 03:53:43.743
DURING MY TIME ON AT THE CITY OF

03:53:43.809 --> 03:53:44.744
FRESNO.

03:53:44.810 --> 03:53:48.814
WE HAD INSTITUTE -- SLUM LORD --

03:53:48.881 --> 03:53:50.316
RULES TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

03:53:50.383 --> 03:53:52.385
PEOPLE WERE ABIDING BY

03:53:52.451 --> 03:53:54.487
CALIFORNIA SAFE A HABITATION

03:53:54.553 --> 03:53:55.588
STANDARDS.

03:53:55.654 --> 03:53:57.456
ARE AND WE USED ALL THE HEROES

03:53:57.523 --> 03:53:58.491
IN THE CORNER QUIVER TO MAKE

03:53:58.557 --> 03:54:00.393
CERTAIN THAT WE HOLD PEOPLE

03:54:00.459 --> 03:54:01.627
ACCOUNTABLE.

03:54:01.694 --> 03:54:02.428
OKAY I GUESS WHAT WHEN I'M

03:54:02.495 --> 03:54:04.330
SAYING IS THAT THE NEAR THAT'S

03:54:04.397 --> 03:54:05.398
PUT OUT THERE.

03:54:05.464 --> 03:54:07.700
IS THAT INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE

03:54:07.767 --> 03:54:09.435
THE RIGHT TO ASSOCIATE AND

03:54:09.502 --> 03:54:10.936
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:54:11.003 --> 03:54:12.605
THAT INDIVIDUALS DO NOT HAVE THE

03:54:12.671 --> 03:54:15.174
ABILITY TO SEEK RECOURSE WITH

03:54:15.241 --> 03:54:17.176
THE AUTHORITIES ARE AND THAT'S

03:54:17.243 --> 03:54:18.411
NOT TRUE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

03:54:18.477 --> 03:54:20.312
THE ABILITY TO SEEK REDRESS IN

03:54:20.379 --> 03:54:23.449
THE COURTS AND THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:54:23.516 --> 03:54:24.984
STORE CREATING THIS THIS

03:54:25.050 --> 03:54:29.355
NARRATIVE AYE I FRANKLY FIND.

03:54:29.422 --> 03:54:31.090
INACCURATE.

03:54:31.157 --> 03:54:32.224
ARMY AND I THINK WHAT THIS GOES

03:54:32.291 --> 03:54:32.792
TO IS THAT.

03:54:32.858 --> 03:54:34.727
THE IDEA OF ASSEMBLING

03:54:34.794 --> 03:54:37.797
INDIVIDUALS INTO A UNION IS NOT

03:54:37.863 --> 03:54:39.665
FOR SAFE HABITATION.

03:54:39.732 --> 03:54:41.834
IT IS FOR RENT CONTROL AND

03:54:41.901 --> 03:54:43.068
THAT'S WHERE THIS IS GOING I

03:54:43.135 --> 03:54:45.104
FEAR AND THAT'S REASON I

03:54:45.171 --> 03:54:47.373
RESPECTFULLY -- HAVE TO BE A NO

03:54:47.440 --> 03:54:49.508
VOTE.

03:54:49.575 --> 03:54:52.645

ANY TIME YOU TRY TO RESTRICT

03:54:56.682 --> 03:54:59.318
SOMETHING.

03:54:59.385 --> 03:55:01.086
THEN THE PRICE USUALLY WILL GO

03:55:01.153 --> 03:55:03.322
OUT.

03:55:03.389 --> 03:55:04.957
THAT'S BEEN PROVEN BY RENT

03:55:05.024 --> 03:55:06.492
CONTROL MEASURES THROUGHOUT

03:55:06.559 --> 03:55:09.595
CALIFORNIA.

03:55:09.662 --> 03:55:12.031
AND WOULD IT BE THE TENANTS THAT

03:55:12.097 --> 03:55:14.567
PUT UP THE MONEY.

03:55:14.633 --> 03:55:16.001
THE BILL THESE UNITS NOW.

03:55:16.068 --> 03:55:19.104
IT'S SOME KIND OF INVESTOR.

03:55:19.171 --> 03:55:21.740
AND SOMETIMES THESE AREN'T BIG

03:55:21.807 --> 03:55:22.741
RICH PEOPLE THERE.

03:55:22.808 --> 03:55:26.178
THE MOM AND POPS THAT HAVE FOR

03:55:26.245 --> 03:55:27.046
FIVE TEN UNITS.

03:55:27.112 --> 03:55:28.481
THE BILL ROPER PERIOD OF TIME

03:55:28.547 --> 03:55:31.083
MANY FAMILIES.

03:55:31.150 --> 03:55:32.885
HAVE THAT SIDE ENTERPRISE.

03:55:32.952 --> 03:55:35.521
IN THIS IS IN FACT.

03:55:35.588 --> 03:55:38.891
GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT.

03:55:38.958 --> 03:55:40.359
FOR US TO HAVE SECURE HOUSING.

03:55:40.426 --> 03:55:43.762
FOR THE POPULATION.

03:55:43.829 --> 03:55:45.664
JUST AN EXAMPLE [inaudible]

03:55:45.731 --> 03:55:47.233
PARADISE [inaudible]

03:55:47.299 --> 03:55:49.835
BURNED OUT.

03:55:49.902 --> 03:55:53.138
WHERE DO ALL THOSE PEOPLE GO?

03:55:53.205 --> 03:55:57.676
THERE'S NO HOUSING AVAILABLE.

03:55:57.743 --> 03:55:59.612
AND IN TERMS OF ANYTHING BE IN.

03:55:59.678 --> 03:56:02.515
FAST TO BUILD I I'M NOT.

03:56:02.581 --> 03:56:03.883
STILL I OF AN INSEPARABLE

03:56:03.949 --> 03:56:06.018
OPTIMISTIC WE CAN DO SOMETHING

03:56:06.085 --> 03:56:07.419
IN CALIFORNIA.

03:56:07.486 --> 03:56:09.655
EXPEDITE THE PERMITTING PROCESS

03:56:09.722 --> 03:56:13.325

THAT CHAU IMPEDE.

03:56:15.461 --> 03:56:18.497
AN ADD TO THE COSTS.

03:56:18.564 --> 03:56:21.700
I REMEMBER AN ADVOCATE OF THE

03:56:21.767 --> 03:56:24.203
HOMELESS SPEAKING.

03:56:24.270 --> 03:56:26.405
THE CZECHO TWO YEARS AGO.

03:56:26.472 --> 03:56:28.340
CONDEMNING WHAT CALIFORNIA HAD

03:56:28.407 --> 03:56:30.109
DONE TO MAKE HOUSING SO

03:56:30.175 --> 03:56:32.311
EXPENSIVE.

03:56:32.378 --> 03:56:34.179
SO EXPENSIVE THAT EVEN THE

03:56:34.246 --> 03:56:35.548
HOMELESS COULD NOT FIND

03:56:35.614 --> 03:56:36.982
FACILITIES.

03:56:37.049 --> 03:56:41.320
THAT WERE BUILT. FOR THEM.

03:56:41.387 --> 03:56:42.688
BECAUSE THEN WHAT THEY

03:56:42.755 --> 03:56:43.923
COMPLAINED ABOUT SPECIFICALLY

03:56:43.989 --> 03:56:45.824
WAS A SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

03:56:45.891 --> 03:56:48.794
ADDED TO THE COST.

03:56:48.861 --> 03:56:50.996
AND SHE ARGUED HOW MANY MORE.

03:56:51.063 --> 03:56:54.099
HOMELESS PEOPLE COULD BE HOUSE

03:56:54.166 --> 03:56:56.168

03:56:58.470 --> 03:57:01.373
THIS.

03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:04.476
I I THINK IT'S IT'S A A SOLUTION.

03:57:04.543 --> 03:57:07.346
CHECKING A PROBLEM.

03:57:07.413 --> 03:57:09.615
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

03:57:09.682 --> 03:57:11.617
I URGE A NO VOTE [inaudible]

03:57:11.684 --> 03:57:14.954
WIENER GIRL.

03:57:15.020 --> 03:57:16.255

YESTERDAY AFTER WE HEARD THIS

03:57:21.060 --> 03:57:21.527
BILL.

03:57:21.594 --> 03:57:24.163

CALLS TEXT MESSAGES.

03:57:29.501 --> 03:57:32.171
I'M ON THE UNFAIRNESS A LOT OF

03:57:32.237 --> 03:57:34.607
THE TIMES BETWEEN THE TENANT AND

03:57:34.673 --> 03:57:35.441
THE LANDLORD.

03:57:35.507 --> 03:57:36.976
I SHARED SOME STORIES YESTERDAY

03:57:37.042 --> 03:57:39.478
WHERE WE HAVE LANDLORDS.

03:57:39.545 --> 03:57:42.047
THAT -- IT TAKES MONTHS ALMOST

03:57:42.114 --> 03:57:44.216
TWO YEARS SOMETIMES YEARS TO GET

03:57:44.283 --> 03:57:46.318
SOMEBODY OUT OF AN APARTMENT.

03:57:46.385 --> 03:57:47.920
AND THEN WHEN THEY LEAVE I HEARD

03:57:47.987 --> 03:57:49.588
A STORY YESTERDAY AFTER THIS WAS

03:57:49.655 --> 03:57:50.856
DEBATED ON THE FLOOR THEY RIPPED

03:57:50.923 --> 03:57:52.024
OUT THE CABINETS TO THE

03:57:52.091 --> 03:57:53.025
APPLIANCES.

03:57:53.092 --> 03:57:54.560
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE

03:57:54.627 --> 03:57:56.762
DONE -- TO THE TENANTS THAT DO

03:57:56.829 --> 03:57:58.731
THESE THINGS SO I UNDERSTAND AND

03:57:58.797 --> 03:57:59.832
I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR ABOUT

03:57:59.898 --> 03:58:01.600
MAKING SURE AND LIKE THAT MY

03:58:01.667 --> 03:58:03.268
COLLEAGUE FROM LA TALKED ABOUT

03:58:03.335 --> 03:58:04.870
YESTERDAY WERE AT A LADY WOULD

03:58:04.937 --> 03:58:06.872
LIVED IN APARTMENT. FOR THIRTY

03:58:06.939 --> 03:58:08.641
YEARS IS IS BEING A TRYING TO BE

03:58:08.707 --> 03:58:10.175
EVICTED AND AND IT HAD YOU KNOW

03:58:10.242 --> 03:58:11.610
INTERVIEW MENTION HAD TO TAKE

03:58:11.677 --> 03:58:12.544
PLACE.

03:58:12.611 --> 03:58:14.780
SO I GET THAT BUT THE LONG RULES

03:58:14.847 --> 03:58:17.583
THAT THIS BODY HAS CREATED --

03:58:17.650 --> 03:58:19.652
OVER THE LENGTH OF TIME -- OVER

03:58:19.718 --> 03:58:21.987
THE OF THE LAST DECADE HAS

03:58:22.054 --> 03:58:23.822
CREATED AN IMPACT OF COST AND

03:58:23.889 --> 03:58:26.358
FEES WERE 53% OF THE STATE SAYS

03:58:26.425 --> 03:58:27.693
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE

03:58:27.760 --> 03:58:28.494
AND IF YOU TAKE THAT TO

03:58:28.560 --> 03:58:31.296
MILLENNIALS AT 63%.

03:58:31.363 --> 03:58:33.232
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE RENT --

03:58:33.298 --> 03:58:35.868
HOUSING AND THESE FIVE

03:58:35.934 --> 03:58:37.503
ORGANIZATIONS OR ASSOCIATIONS

03:58:37.569 --> 03:58:39.071
THAT ARE TRYING TO BE FORMED.

03:58:39.138 --> 03:58:41.073
IT'S ALL ABOUT REDUCING THE COST

03:58:41.140 --> 03:58:42.875
OF HOUSING AND I GET IT BECAUSE

03:58:42.941 --> 03:58:44.109
HOUSING IS EXPENSIVE.

03:58:44.176 --> 03:58:46.045
BUT RENT CONTROL WAS VOTED ON

03:58:46.111 --> 03:58:47.146
LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO

03:58:47.212 --> 03:58:49.248
SAID OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE

03:58:49.314 --> 03:58:49.748
VOTERS IN THE STATE OF

03:58:49.815 --> 03:58:50.749
CALIFORNIA.

03:58:50.816 --> 03:58:52.851
AND THEY VOTED TO NOT ALLOW RENT

03:58:52.918 --> 03:58:54.520
CONTROL TO BE PART OF THE

03:58:54.586 --> 03:58:55.421
PROCESS.

03:58:55.487 --> 03:58:56.889
AND SO TO COME UP WITH BILLS

03:58:56.955 --> 03:58:59.258
THEY HAVE AN END RUN AROUND THAT

03:58:59.324 --> 03:59:00.659
AND THE ONE THAT'S ON THE OTHER

03:59:00.726 --> 03:59:01.994
SIDE OF THE HOUSE -- TO

03:59:02.061 --> 03:59:04.396
BLATANTLY JUST REINTRODUCE THAT

03:59:04.463 --> 03:59:05.664
BILL AND GO AROUND THE VOTERS

03:59:05.731 --> 03:59:06.699
IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

03:59:06.765 --> 03:59:08.600
SHOULD BE DOING SO I THINK THE

03:59:08.667 --> 03:59:11.070
AUTHOR FOR AT LEAST BRINGING UP

03:59:11.136 --> 03:59:13.205
THE ISSUE -- ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW

03:59:13.272 --> 03:59:14.406
THE HOUSING ISSUE WHEN THAT THE

03:59:14.473 --> 03:59:16.575
RENTERS THAT NEED A PLACES TO

03:59:16.642 --> 03:59:18.377
LIVE IN I AGREE IF IT WASN'T

03:59:18.444 --> 03:59:19.511
SOMEONE AFFORDABLE I THINK

03:59:19.578 --> 03:59:20.679
PEOPLE WOULD BE PURSUING THE

03:59:20.746 --> 03:59:22.414
AMERICAN DREAM AND BUYING A HOME

03:59:22.481 --> 03:59:24.116
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN BILLS

03:59:24.183 --> 03:59:24.983

03:59:25.050 --> 03:59:25.184
BEEN.

03:59:25.250 --> 03:59:26.652
OFF THIS FLOOR THIS WEEK ABOUT

03:59:26.719 --> 03:59:30.956

ESTABLISHING CREDIT FOR THE RENT

03:59:32.958 --> 03:59:33.459
PAYMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S

03:59:33.525 --> 03:59:34.126
PRETTY PHENOMENAL AND WE NEED TO

03:59:34.193 --> 03:59:34.626
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE

03:59:34.693 --> 03:59:35.527
REDUCTION OF COST OF HOUSING.

03:59:35.594 --> 03:59:36.628
AND WE NEED TO WORK ON GOOD

03:59:36.695 --> 03:59:38.831
POLICY IN THIS HOUSE THAT

03:59:38.897 --> 03:59:40.899
GENERATES HOUSING -- FOR ALL OF

US AND AND OUR CONSTITUENTS TO

03:59:42.468 --> 03:59:43.769
LIVE AND SO I WOULD I

03:59:43.836 --> 03:59:46.839
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL.

ASSOCIATIONS BUT THIS IS NOT

04:01:17.863 --> 04:01:19.998
INTENDED TO CREATE THE

04:01:20.065 --> 04:01:21.366
OPERATIONS OF THE TENANT

04:01:21.433 --> 04:01:24.670
ASSOCIATION TEN ASSOCIATIONS GET

04:01:29.508 --> 04:01:32.010
BONAFIDE ASSOCIATION.

04:01:32.077 --> 04:01:34.713

FUNCTIONS THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT

04:01:40.986 --> 04:01:43.121
THE PLACE OF THIS BILL THIS BILL

04:01:43.188 --> 04:01:45.524
IS SIMPLY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

04:01:45.591 --> 04:01:48.293
OF RETALIATION.

04:01:48.360 --> 04:01:50.729
IN CASE OF A TENANT IN VERY

04:01:50.796 --> 04:01:52.497
LIMITED VERY NARROW

04:01:52.564 --> 04:01:54.800
CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S NOT.

04:01:54.867 --> 04:01:57.269
THE BIG YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IT'S

04:01:57.336 --> 04:01:59.705
A VERY VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCE

04:01:59.771 --> 04:02:04.142
ONLY HAS TO DO WITH RETALIATION.

04:02:04.209 --> 04:02:05.410
IF IT'S A TENANT.

04:02:05.477 --> 04:02:07.579
THAT HAS JOINED AN ASSOCIATION

04:02:07.646 --> 04:02:10.048

04:02:10.115 --> 04:02:11.717
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THREE A MORE

04:02:11.783 --> 04:02:13.986

YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS VERY

04:02:15.988 --> 04:02:17.656
NARROW BUT IT'S NOT THE PRACTICE

04:02:17.723 --> 04:02:20.626
THE THE STRUCTURAL -- DOESN'T

04:02:20.692 --> 04:02:22.361
DICTATE THE STRUCTURAL WAYS INTO

04:02:22.427 --> 04:02:24.529
AN ERA IN WHICH AN ASSOCIATION

04:02:24.596 --> 04:02:24.897
IS GOING TO BE.

04:02:24.963 --> 04:02:27.032

HER SPEAK PASSIONATELY -- BOTH

04:02:40.946 --> 04:02:41.713
IN COMMITTEE IN HERE ON THE

04:02:41.780 --> 04:02:44.549
FLOOR ON THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES.

04:02:44.616 --> 04:02:46.285
I JUST BELIEVE THAT THIS

04:02:46.351 --> 04:02:48.020
PARTICULAR BILL AND THIS

04:02:48.086 --> 04:02:53.058
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- HAS SOME

04:02:53.125 --> 04:02:54.593
DEFICIENCIES IN IT DOESN'T SPELL

04:02:54.660 --> 04:02:58.497
OUT THOSE THAT PROCESS OF HOW.

04:02:58.563 --> 04:03:00.365
THE TENANTS CAN ORGANIZE.

04:03:00.432 --> 04:03:01.767
WHAT THE LIMIT OF THEIR

04:03:01.833 --> 04:03:03.502
ORGANIZATION IS?

04:03:03.568 --> 04:03:05.504
WHAT OTHER ASSOCIATIONS CAN THEY

04:03:05.570 --> 04:03:09.141
ASSOCIATE WITH -- THERE AS HAS

04:03:09.207 --> 04:03:10.375
BEEN STATED ON THE FLOOR THERE'S

04:03:10.442 --> 04:03:12.778
SOME CONCERNS THAT HE OF

04:03:12.844 --> 04:03:13.078
UNIONIZING.

04:03:13.145 --> 04:03:16.148
NO APARTMENT RENTERS I THINK

04:03:16.214 --> 04:03:17.749
THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN AYE

04:03:17.816 --> 04:03:18.984
AYE.

04:03:19.051 --> 04:03:20.585
I WOULD THINK THAT THE THE

04:03:20.652 --> 04:03:22.120
CURRENT LEGITIMATE LABOR

04:03:22.187 --> 04:03:23.455
ORGANIZATIONS WOULD HAVE A

04:03:23.522 --> 04:03:27.559
CONCERN ABOUT THIS AS WELL -- IS

04:03:27.626 --> 04:03:29.394
ESPECIALLY THE POLITICAL ACTION

04:03:29.461 --> 04:03:30.495
SIDE OF IT.

04:03:30.562 --> 04:03:32.464
THERE'S NO THERE'S NOTHING IN

04:03:32.531 --> 04:03:35.901
HERE THAT LIMITS OR ALLOWS OR

04:03:35.968 --> 04:03:37.769
REGULATES.

04:03:37.836 --> 04:03:39.571
WHAT THAT IS AND I JUST THINK

04:03:39.638 --> 04:03:42.607
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF -- AND

04:03:42.674 --> 04:03:44.343
ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON THIS

04:03:44.409 --> 04:03:45.877
PARTICULAR ISSUE AND I WOULD

04:03:45.944 --> 04:03:48.280
URGE A NO VOTE UNTIL WE'RE ABLE

04:03:48.347 --> 04:03:49.948

04:04:00.592 --> 04:04:02.194
NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE BILL

04:04:02.260 --> 04:04:03.929
THAT TALKED ABOUT RENT CONTROL I

04:04:03.996 --> 04:04:05.697
ALSO DID NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE

04:04:05.764 --> 04:04:08.066
BILL ABOUT -- THE TENANTS BEING

04:04:08.133 --> 04:04:09.701

LOVE THAT IDEA AND MAYBE WE CAN

04:04:14.406 --> 04:04:15.140
AMEND THAT INTO THE BILL.

04:04:15.207 --> 04:04:16.675
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO TALK

04:04:16.742 --> 04:04:19.811
ABOUT TODAY IS?

04:04:19.878 --> 04:04:21.513
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ON

RENT TO PEOPLE AND BUILD WEALTH

04:06:03.448 --> 04:06:04.716

04:12:35.106 --> 04:12:36.708
OF THIS PROPOSAL I THINK THE

04:12:36.774 --> 04:12:39.277
AUTHOR. FOR THE MANY YEARS THAT

04:12:39.344 --> 04:12:42.280
HE HAS SPENT WORKING ON THIS --

04:12:42.347 --> 04:12:44.015
TRYING TO COME TO A SOLUTION.

04:12:44.082 --> 04:12:47.085
THAT -- OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS HIS

04:12:47.151 --> 04:12:47.886
DISTRICT BUT I BELIEVE IT

04:12:47.952 --> 04:12:50.588
IMPACTS -- NOT JUST HIS DISTRICT

04:12:50.655 --> 04:12:52.223
BUT ALL FORTY SENATE DISTRICTS

04:12:52.290 --> 04:12:53.791
IN THE STATE.

04:12:53.858 --> 04:12:55.627
AS HE STATED THAT THIS IS ONE OF

04:12:55.693 --> 04:12:58.263
THE TOP -- BRIDGES IN THE

04:12:58.329 --> 04:13:02.133
COUNTRY THAT IS USED FOR SUICIDE.

04:13:02.200 --> 04:13:04.002
AND THOSE SUICIDES DON'T JUST

04:13:04.068 --> 04:13:06.204
IMPACT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS

04:13:06.271 --> 04:13:08.239
GOTTEN TO SUCH A DESPAIR IN

04:13:08.306 --> 04:13:09.541
THEIR LIFE THAT THE ONLY

04:13:09.607 --> 04:13:11.442
SOLUTION THEY SEEK IS TO END

04:13:11.509 --> 04:13:13.444
THEIR OWN LIFE.

04:13:13.511 --> 04:13:15.446
BUT IT LEAVES BEHIND A RIPPLE

04:13:15.513 --> 04:13:18.016
EFFECT OF DESPAIR.

04:13:18.082 --> 04:13:20.084
AMONGST THEIR FAMILIES --

04:13:20.151 --> 04:13:21.419
AMONGST THEIR FRIENDS AND

04:13:21.486 --> 04:13:23.288
COLLEAGUES.

04:13:23.354 --> 04:13:24.923
AMONGST THEIR CO WORKERS AND

04:13:24.989 --> 04:13:28.426
PEOPLE THAT KNEW THAT PERSON AND

04:13:28.493 --> 04:13:30.962
PERSONALLY.

04:13:31.029 --> 04:13:32.864
IT LEAVES A RIPPLE EFFECT ON

04:13:32.931 --> 04:13:35.033
COUNSELORS.

04:13:35.099 --> 04:13:37.235
THEY HAVE TRIED TO MISTER THOSE

04:13:37.302 --> 04:13:40.805
INDIVIDUALS TO PREVENT.

04:13:40.872 --> 04:13:43.241
SUCH AN ACT OF DESPAIR.

04:13:43.308 --> 04:13:44.542
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

04:13:44.609 --> 04:13:46.911
SOMETIMES IS OVERLOOKED AND NOT

04:13:46.978 --> 04:13:48.379
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

04:13:48.446 --> 04:13:50.048
IS EFFECTIVE THE HOUSE OUR FIRST

04:13:50.114 --> 04:13:52.083
RESPONDERS.

04:13:52.150 --> 04:13:53.151
AND THIS.

04:13:53.217 --> 04:13:55.420
SITUATION HAS BECOME PERSONAL TO

04:13:55.486 --> 04:13:57.088
ME MOST RECENTLY.

04:13:57.155 --> 04:13:59.724
AS TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS.

04:13:59.791 --> 04:14:01.693
THEIR SONS HAVE JUSTRECENTLY

04:14:01.759 --> 04:14:03.928
BEEN RECRUITED AND OBTAINED A

04:14:03.995 --> 04:14:05.597
POSITION ON ON THE SAN DIEGO

04:14:05.663 --> 04:14:07.865
HARBOR POLICE.

04:14:07.932 --> 04:14:08.967
AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE

04:14:09.033 --> 04:14:13.871
TO RESPOND. TO THE SITUATIONS.

04:14:13.938 --> 04:14:15.540
AND IT'S OUR POLICE OFFICERS OUR

04:14:15.607 --> 04:14:18.610
FIREFIGHTERS ARE PARAMEDICS.

04:14:18.676 --> 04:14:20.645
AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS THERE

04:14:20.712 --> 04:14:22.447
ARE THE FIRST ON THE SCENE. TO

04:14:22.513 --> 04:14:24.582
THE SITUATIONS [inaudible]

04:14:24.649 --> 04:14:30.655
THAT -- HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

04:14:30.722 --> 04:14:32.290
OF THE OF THE SITUATION TAKE

04:14:32.357 --> 04:14:33.992
CARE OF THE SCENE.

04:14:34.058 --> 04:14:35.360
AND THEN AFTER THAT.

04:14:35.426 --> 04:14:36.527
HAVE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE

04:14:36.594 --> 04:14:38.363
FAMILY.

04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:39.364
AND THE FRIENDS.

04:14:39.430 --> 04:14:41.532
THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND.

04:14:41.599 --> 04:14:44.402
SO I THINK THIS IS A SMALL STEP.

04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:46.804
AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE.

04:14:46.871 --> 04:14:48.573
TO HELP PREVENT.

04:14:48.640 --> 04:14:50.742
THOSE TRAGIC SITUATIONS.

04:14:50.808 --> 04:14:53.544
AND THOSE ACTS OF DESPAIR.

04:14:53.611 --> 04:14:56.114
AND I THINK THE AUTHOR AGAIN.
