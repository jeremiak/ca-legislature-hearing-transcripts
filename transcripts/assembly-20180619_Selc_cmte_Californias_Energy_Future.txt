PUTTING ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS RESTORED THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS FOR BEING PRESENT FOR THE FIRST MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. ALSO THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE PUBLIC PRESENT TODAY AND TO THOSE WHO MAY BE TUNING IN OUR MIND HER WATCHING ON TV. AND YOU WANT TO ANNOUNCE THE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THEY ARE ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA SYMBOL MEMBER RUBIO. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD -- WHICH SIDE REFORM THIS COMMITTEE AS A PLATFORM TO DISCUSS CALIFORNIA'S PRESSING ENERGY CHALLENGES AND TRIUMPHS. WE JUST OF QUESTIONS LEARN ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER AS POLICY MAKERS TO SUPPORT AND ENERGY FUTURE THAT WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A WORLD LEADER IN SETTING CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. THIS BODY IS CHAMPION MANY OF THE STATE'S CLAIM. I CLIMATE POLICIES BUT TODAY'S AGENDA FOCUSES ON ONE PROGRAM OVER WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD LITTLE INVOLVEMENT. THAT'S THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE'VE INVITED SEVERAL PANELS OF EXPERTS HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM. IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMPLYING. TO MAINTAIN OUR POSITION AS A GLOBAL LEADER OF THESE ISSUES WE BUST HAVE A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PROGRAMS WE MUST RECOGNIZE. OR WE MAY HAVE CHALLENGES IN MEETING GOALS. ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES IN WAYS THAT ENSURE CONTINUED ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC SUCCESS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT PROGRAMS CURRENTLY BEING REVIEWED AND UPDATED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AS WE KNOW TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE POLICY TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM. TODAY WE HOPE TO HEAR HOW THIS PROGRAM IS HELPING THE METER CLIMATE GOALS IN THIS SECTOR ALSO THE WAYS IN WHICH COMPANIES AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMPLYING AND PARTICIPATING. I HOPE THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL FIND THE INFORMATION USEFUL ON ALLOWS CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. ON CLIMATE POLICIES IN AN INFORMED MANNER. THE FORMAT OF TODAY'S HEARING IS BROKEN UP INTO THREE PANELS FIRST WE WILL INVITE UP THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM FOR WHICH THEY HAVE PREPARED A DOCUMENT. I THAT IS INCLUDED IN OUR MEMBERS FOLDERS. I DURING OUR SECOND PANEL WE WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM REGULATED PARTY'S UNDER THE L. CFS PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE INVITED -- SEVERAL PANEL A PANEL OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM SEVERAL PRODUCERS OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS. AND OUR LAST PANEL WE HAVE CONVENED A PANEL OF INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS WILL PRESENT RESEARCH TO TESTIFY. ON THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. UP THAT THIS IS A THOROUGH AND FRUITFUL DISCUSSION AND I WELCOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO COME. IN TRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION BY ASKING. QUESTIONS OF OUR PANELISTS -- AND I KNOW WE HAVE SEVERAL MEMBERS THAT ARE STUCK AND SEVERAL OTHER HEARINGS RIGHT NOW SO MEMBERS MAY BE COMING IN AND OUT I KNOW THEY'RE THERE. COUPLE OF MEMBERS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN ATTENDING. AND I HAD PLANNED ON ATTENDING BUT ANOTHER SECOND HEALTH. HIGHER EDUCATION AGING. AND A HOST OF OTHER COMMITTEES AND PRESENTING -- BILLS OVER IN THE SENATE AS WELL. SO WITH THAT -- WILL BE TURNED OVER TO SELLING OUR MATHIS IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS BEFORE WE GET WITH THE FIRST PANEL. THE US CHAIR -- FOR ME. WAIT WHAT I FOUND OUT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THIS COMMITTEE PUT TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY REACHED OUT. ENERGY IS OF THE ELEMENTS IMPORTANCE IN OUR STATE. AND AND USE THAT OR THE HEAD OF US. AND YOU KNOW KNOWING WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE FUTURE -- FOR MY KIDS AND MY GRANDKIDS I DEFINITELY WANTED TO BE PART OF THIS -- ALSO BE IN ONE OF THREE MEMBERS OUT OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY TOTAL IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE THAT'S GRADUATED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S LEGISLATIVE ENERGY HORIZON INSTITUTE. I WANTED TO ENSURE THAT I ALSO HAVE A SEAT ON THIS. COMMITTEE AS WELL -- I'M INTERESTED IN THE DISCUSSION IN ONE ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING THE MOST -- SENSIBLE APPROACH. AND I TO ENERGY IN OUR STATE AND LOOKING FOR VIABLE SOLUTIONS -- FOR ENERGY. THAT ARE GONNA BE ECONOMICALLY SOUND FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE MATHIS DISCORDANT GET STARTED WITH OUR FIRST PANEL I BELIEVE IT IS -- MISTER ROSS BROWN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND MISTER BROWN HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBER ROSS BROWN WITH THE ALEJO -- AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED WE PUT TOGETHER A HAND OUT FOR TODAY'S HEARING AND SO I'LL BE -- BASE IN A LOT OF MY COMMENTS -- ON THE CONTENT NOT HANDOUTS OR TRY TO WALK THROUGH THAT -- ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE GO THROUGH ITS JUST SOME BASIC BACKGROUND ON THE LCF US. I KNOW HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS SOME HISTORICAL UPDATE ON THE PROGRAM -- TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES THAT A RB IS PROPOSING AS PART OF ITS REGULATORY PACKAGE. AND THEN BRIEFLY TOUCH ON JUST SOME ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMITMENT COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AS A CONDUCTOR ITS OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT -- JUST BEFORE I I DIVE INTO THE HAND OUT -- I DO WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT NEARLY ALL CFS IS A A COMPLEX PROGRAM AND WE HAVE NOT DONE A SORT OF FULL IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER THIS. AYE INFORMATION BUT TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE SORT OF IT'S ABOUT SORT OF HOW DIFFERENT PARTIES COMPLY WITH THE PROGRAM IN THE SPECIFICS OF SOME OF THE DETAILS. ARE HAPPY TO KIND OF GET BACK BACK TO YOU ON THOSE QUESTIONS AND I'M SURE YOU'RE A SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS WILL WILL HAVE MY SOME RESPONSES TO SOME OF QUESTIONS AS WELL SO I JUST WANNA. GET THAT OUT THERE -- SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT JUST BRIEFLY SOME BACKGROUND -- LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD -- FIRST CREATED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND NINE UNDER ITS A. B. THIRTY TWO AUTHORITY -- TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS PART OF A LARGER BROADER STRATEGY -- FOR MEETING THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS THAT INCLUDES A VARIETY OF OTHER POLICIES. INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE -- RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD VEHICLE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS POLICIES TO TRY TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED -- THE GOAL OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS REALLY TO REDUCE THE LIFECYCLE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE FUELS THEMSELVES SO -- THERE'S ARE TARGETING ONE PARTICULAR ASPECT OF TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS AND THAT'S WHERE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE FUEL SO NOT BID. OFFICIALS IS A VEHICLES OR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. ARM AND THE WAY THE REGULATION DOES THIS IS THE CAR ESTABLISHES A OUT TO CARBON INTENSE ARE IS ESTABLISHES DIFFERENT CARBON INTENSITY BENCHMARKS -- THERE'S ONE FOR GASOLINE THERE'S WILL SEPARATE ONE FOR DIESEL. AYE AND THOSE ARE ANNUAL BENCHMARKS OUT DECLINE. AND THEY ALSO MEASURE THE A OF DIFFERENT FUELS AND SORT OF MEASURE THAT CARBON INTENSITY RELATIVE TO THE BENCHMARK -- AND AND AND SORT OF THAT TRY TO ACHIEVE THOSE STATEWIDE GOALS ARE SET OUT IN THE IN THE BENCHMARK -- I THINK ONE KEY DIFFERENCE TO NOTE BETWEEN THE LCF US AND SOME OF THE OTHER. POLICIES THAT THE STATE HAS A FOR EXAMPLE CAP AND TRADE IS THAT THE EMISSIONS ARE MEASURED ON A LIFE CYCLE BASIS SO. IT'S NOT JUST OR THE MISSIONS ASSOCIATE WITH CONSUMING THE FUEL BUT ALL OF THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EXTRACTING AT FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE GROUND TRANSFORM A NET PROCESSING AT REFINING AT ARMS OF THOSE EMISSIONS ARE COUNTED THOSE PROGRAMMERS AND SOME OTHER PROGRAMS THOSE EMISSIONS ARE PART OF THE ACCOUNTING. SO -- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUTS -- SO HOW DOES THE PROGRAM -- ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE STATEWIDE TARGETS AND BENCHMARKS AYE WHICH ARE OURS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO GO DOWN TO A 10% REDUCTION IN -- TWENTY TWENTY IT REALLY CREATES AS A MARKET SYSTEM OF DEFICITS AND CREDITS FOR COMPLIANCE. ALSO CARP SETS A NEW STANDARD -- AND AND CONVENTIONAL FUEL SUPPLIERS -- LARGELY RIGHT REFINERIES HAVE TO MEET THAT STATEWIDE STANDARD OF THAT BENCHMARK -- EXCEED THE OVERALL BENCHMARK GENERATE DEFICITS -- FUELS THAT ARE SUPPLIED THAT ARE BELOW THAT STATEWIDE NOT ARE BELOW THAT BENCHMARK GENERATE CREDITS. AND OVERALL A AND UNITY DEMONSTRATES COMPLIANCE BY -- OPINION ENOUGH CREDITS TO COVER ITS OVERALL DEFICIT SO THE TABLE THAT YOU SEE AT THE TOP OF PAGE TWO KIND OF GIVES YOU A SENSE OF NO SOME OF THAT CARP AVERAGE CARBON INTENSITY FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUELS SO YOU SEE THAT SORT OF MORE CONVENTIONAL FUEL THE DIESEL. AND GASOLINE ARE ABOVETHE BENCHMARKS FOR THOSE FUELS AND THEN YOU SEE COME UP AS YOU MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE LIST YOU'LL SEE THE AVERAGE CARBON INTENSITY FOR SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE FUELS WHERE -- IF THOSE FIELD OF SURPRISED THERE ARE CREDITS THAT ARE GENERATED AND THEN THEY CAN BE USED TO COVER THE DEFICITS THAT ARE INCURRED BY PROVIDING A A MORE CONVENTIONAL HIGHER CARBON INTENSITY FUEL -- AT DO JUST WANNA KNOW WITHIN THESE BROADER CATEGORIES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE TABLE THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF PATHWAYS -- KIND OF WITHIN THOSE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WHERE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF A PARTICULAR FUEL MIGHT DEPEND ON HOW THE RAW PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED TO PRODUCE THE FUEL WHERE IT'S WHERE IT'S COMING FROM THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO. EITHER ARE ARE A WHITE RIGHT A DIFFERENCE OR CARBON INTENSITIES WITHIN EACH INDIVIDUAL CATEGORY. YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HANDOUTS -- THEY ARE REGULATED PARTIES -- HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPLIANCE OPTIONS TO TRANSFER TO MEET THIS THIS TARGET THAT'S BEEN SET OUT AND COVER THE DEFICITS THAT THEY THAT ARE INCURRED FROM PROVIDING HIGHER CARBON INTENSITY FUELS. ARE THE INCLUDES -- SUPPLYING LOWER CI FUELS SUCH AS BLENDING LOWER CARBON INTENSITY -- ETHANOL INTO GASOLINE AS ONE EXAMPLE -- IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE OUR CARBON INTENSITY FOR EXAMPLE -- PROJECTS THAT MIGHT USE. OIL CAN BE -- CAN GENERATE A CREDIT IN THOSE CREDITS CAN BE USED TO COMPLY -- AND THIRD PURCHASING PRODUCTS FROM A LOW CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS THAT HAD GET CREDITS FROM SO AND THOSE THOSE FIELDS. ARE ALSO EXCESS CREDITS NOW THEY'RE GENERATING NEW YEAR THAT AREN'T USED CAN BE BANKS IN HOUSTON AND FUTURE YEARS AS WELL. I AM I THINK ONE OF THE THE KEY FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM AND SORT OF THAT THE MAIN REASON WHY I THINK THE PROGRAM IS SET UP WITH THE SYSTEM OF DEFICITS AND CREDITS. ARM IS THAT THE PROGRAM IS REALLY INTENDED TO BE FUELED NEUTRAL. AREN'T MEANING THAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR FEEL BE USED TO MEET THE OVERALL CARBON INTENSITY STANDARD. AND INSTEAD IT SORT OF PROVIDES THESE -- INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF CREDIT PRICES -- FOR FOR AT INDUSTRIES OUT THERE TO PROVIDE THE MIX OF FUELS THAT ARE A LEAST COSTLY -- NEED -- WAITS ECONOMY THE OVERALL STANDARD THAT'S ESTABLISHED IN THE PROGRAM. SO -- NEXT I'LL MOVE ON TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HANDOUT WHICH WAS REALLY JUST SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF JUST GIVING YOU SOME CONTEXT OF AND WHERE WE'VE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM SO FAR JUST AS FAR AS THE NOTE NUMBER OF CREDITS AND DEFICITS THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED. I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS CHART THEIR RELEASED A QUARTER OVER THE LAST -- FEW YEARS OF THE CREDITS ARE KIND OF A LIGHT SHADE IN YOUR IN YOUR CHART -- BUT MAYBE FIRST OFF FOCUS ON SORT OF THE DARK BARS IN YOUR CHART WHICH IS KIND THE QUARTERLY DEFICITS THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN THE PROGRAM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- THOSE DEFICITS HAVE BEEN INCREASING. LARGELY AS A FUNCTION OF SORT OF WHEN THE A STANDARD BECOMES MORE STRINGENT EACH YEAR THAT MEANS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SUPPLYING A PARTICULAR GASOLINE FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF OF DEFICITS THAT ARE INCURRED. FOR THAT GALLON OF GASOLINE INCREASES AND SO SORT OF THE NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT DEFICITS INCREASES AS THE STANDARD BECOMES. MORE STRINGENT OVERTIME -- THE SECOND POINT IS A NUMBER OF CREDITS YOU CAN SEE THEM ON SO THE LIGHT SHADED BARS ON THEIR HAVE ALSO BEEN INCREASING OVER TIME -- REFLECTING SORT OF ADDITIONAL A LOW CARBON FUEL SUPPLY AND IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CREDITS AND DEFICITS THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN THE PROGRAM CREDITS HAVE EXCEEDED DEFICITS. FOR OUR ALMOST THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROGRAM IN SOME CASES -- BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE CREDITS THAT ARE GENERATED BUT THAT ARGUES CAN BE BANKS AND USED IN FUTURE YEARS SO WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS. A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BANK OF CREDITS THAT HAVE BEEN USED BUT THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR COMPLIANCE. I IN FUTURE YEARS. ARM AND THEN FINALLY IF YOU LOOK AT SORT OF THE VERY RIGHT HAND SIDE OF YOUR CHART YOU'LL SEE -- AT TOWARDS THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE PROGRAM REACHED A POINT WHERE THE LEVEL OF DEFICITS ACTUALLY EXCEEDED IN SOME QUARTERS THE LEVEL CREDITS THAT WERE GENERATED IN SO THAT'S A YOU USE THAT YOU KIND OF SEE THOSE ARE CONVERGING AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE FUNCTION OF THE PROGRAM. BECOMING A MORE STRINGENT -- AND SNOW MOVING FORWARD IT IF THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE THEN SOME OF THE OPTIONS ARE USING SOME OF THE BANKS CREDITS TO COMPLY. WITH THE PROGRAM -- IT ALSO [inaudible] COURAGE AND BRING IN MORE LOW CARBON FUELS THE MARKET POTENTIALLY. SO TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HANDOUT -- SO I JUST TALKED ABOUT AND OF THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CREDITS THAT ARE GENERATED THIS IS REALLY JUST A FIGURE TRYING TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THOSE CREDITS WHAT TYPES OF OF FUELS HAVE BEEN USED TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATION -- YOU'LL SEE IT'S A A MIX OF YOU KNOW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FUELS THAT BIGGEST ONE BEING EFFORT ALSO FAR BUT ALSO RENEWABLE DIESEL. BIODIESEL LECTURE CITY. AND BIO METHANE. AND THOSE HAVE BEEN ARE INCREASING -- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO PAGE SIX OF YOUR HANDOUTS -- GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THE PRICES FOR CREDITS IN THE PROGRAM HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND I THINK THAT THE FIRST THING THAT JUMPS OUT IS THE SIGNIFICANT VARIATION AND THE CREDIT PRICES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS -- IN THEORY -- NEAR THE CREDIT PRICE REALLY SORT OF REFLECTS THE COST OF PROVIDING THAT LAST UNIT OF LOWER CARBON FUEL ARE THAT LAST CREDIT IN ORDER TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAT ARE SET AND THE PROGRAM -- SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT REALLY KIND OF DRIVE THOSE PRICES THEY COULD REALLY BE ON SORT OF THE DEMAND OR SUPPLY SIDE FOR CREDIT SO -- FOR EXAMPLE SORT OF YOU KNOW AT THE JUST THE OVERALL STRINGENCY OF THE PROGRAM MEANS THAT NO MORE DEFICITS ARE CREATED AND THAT MEANS THERE'S A GREATER DEMAND FOR PRICES AND SO THAT. THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF THE PUSHING UP PRICES ALL ELSE EQUAL. ARE ON THE FLIPSIDE NEAR THINGS THAT AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF OF CREDITS IT'S REALLY -- YOU KNOW THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF DIFFERENT LOW CARBON FUEL OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE COMPLIANCE OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE SUCH A EXTENT THERE'S A A BREAKTHROUGH IN SORT OF AN ABILITY TO PROVIDE. LOW COSTS CREDITS ARE LOW COST FUELS -- THEN THAT -- ALMOST EQUAL HAS THE EFFECT OF OF PUSHING ALLOWS CRISIS DOWN I THINK SOME OF THE THE KEY FACTORS THAT I WOULDN'T SORT OF CLAIM TO KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT HAVE DRIVEN. CHANGES ON ALLOWANCE PRICES THAT YOU SEE IN THE CHART HERE. I THINK A LOT OF THEM THAT ARE DUE TO KIND OF REGULATE CHANGES AND SORT OF THE STRINGENCY OR SORT CHANGES IN REGULATION THAT AFFECT THE STRINGENCY OF THE PROGRAM -- THERE IS A PERIOD OF A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE THE COURT KIND OF FROZE THE STRINGENCY OF THE PROGRAM WHILE CARB HAD -- TO REASSESS -- YES AND ADDRESS SOME SEQUEL -- AND APA ISSUES AND SO -- I THINK THAT WAS SORT OF AROUND THE TIME WE SEE CAN SEE PRICES GOING DOWN THAN CARPET TO KIND OF RE ADOPT THE PROGRAM AND ESTABLISH. I SOME DIFFERENT BENCHMARKS GOING FORWARD AND SOME OF THOSE WERE A FAIRLY STRINGENT AS OC SORT OF IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND SO THAT YOU KNOW HAS THE EFFECT OF OF POTENTIALLY A MOVING PRICES UPWARD SO IT'S A MIX OF SORT OF REGULATORY CHANGES LARGEST MARKET -- MARKET FORCES THAT DRIVE SOME THE CHANGES AN ALLOWANCE PRIZES. AND THEN OF COURSE SAYS SINCE CREDIT CAN BE BANKS THE YA PRICES AND SENT TO SOME DEGREE. ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WHERE IT'S OUR FUTURE PRICES WILL BE AS WELL. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR HANDOUTS -- THE COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO COME IN ON TO SO THAT THE CUTS IN THE COST CONTAINMENT -- PROVISIONS IN THE REGULATION I THINK PROP. PERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE ONE IS THE CREDIT CLEARANCE MARKET WHICH IS INTENDED TO LIMIT COSTS. IN SOME RESPECTS SO GENERALLY PARTIES CAN OUTSIDE OF THE CRITICAL ACTS MARKET CAN -- INSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OTHER TO BUY AND SELL CREDITS -- HOWEVER IF A REGULATED PARTY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH CREDITS TO COMPLY IT CAN PURCHASE ADDITIONAL CREDITS TO THIS SORT OF SEPARATE CREDIT CLARENCE MARKET -- AND SPORTY'S CAN ELECT TO SELL THEIR THE CREDITS IF THEY HAVE FOR A PRICE OF UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE CREDIT CLARENCE MARKET SO. I AM I GET TED JUST KIND OF SOME SOME OF OUR GENERAL COMMENTS ON KIND OF FEEL HOW EFFECTIVE WE THINK THAT MIGHT BE IN JUST -- CONTAINING COSTS BUT IT'S THE THE THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF IT. SO YOU TURN TO PAGE -- EIGHT OF THE HAND OUT JUST A COUPLE OF VERY BRIEF COMMENTS OF JUST THE OVERALL -- AND ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEHIND THE AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD I MEAN IT ESSENTIALLY -- IT HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING COSTS FOR HIGHER CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING COSTS FOR LOWER CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS -- YET THE INCENTIVES WHICH ARE PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF CREDIT PRICES WHICH ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD. ARE DISCOURAGED PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF THE GOALS AND COURAGE THAT PRODUCTION OF THE LOWER CARBON FUELS -- AND SO IN THAT WAY IT MOVED UP PROGRAM COMMIT THOUGHT SORT OF A YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF A CHARGE ON KIND OF HIGHER CARBON FUELS AND AND AND THEN SORT OF PROVIDING IT'S AN AD FOR LOWER CARBON FUELS -- SELF JUST AS AN EXAMPLE WE HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT -- IN THE HANDOUT SORT OF THAT CREDIT PRICES OF A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WHICH IS YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE IN THERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF WHERE CREDIT PRICES ARE NOW -- THE PROGRAM LIKELY ADS SEVERAL CENTS PER GALLON TO THE PRICE OF DIESEL FOR EXAMPLE -- BUT THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE NOW THAT CREDIT GENERATING FUELS THE LOWER CARBON FUELS FOR EXAMPLE A FUEL WITH CARBON INTENSITY OF OF THIRTY CAN GET KIND OF A BENEFIT OF OVER A DOLLAR PER GALLON ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING THE CREDITS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THAT -- FROM THAT FUEL CELL AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF CALM THE ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF THINGS AS THEY STAND RIGHT NOW -- AND THIS IS ALL DONE THROUGH SORT OF THAT THE REGULATORY MARKET THAT'S ESTABLISH SORT OF THE GENERATING OF PRODUCTS IN BUYING AND SELLING OF PRODUCTS. UNLIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ANNUAL CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHICH IS ANOTHER MARKET BASED SYSTEM NONE OF THIS YEAR REALLY SORT OF TOUCH AS A STATE ACCOUNT THERE'S NO YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT REVENUE COMING INTO A STATE ACCOUNT THEN THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATES IT'S BUT ALL SET UP THROUGH A REGULATORY. STRUCTURE AND BUYING AND SELLING OF CREDITS FROM -- PARTIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATION. OF TURN TO PAGE NINE OF YOUR HAND OUT -- I'LL JUST TOUCH ON SOME OF THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT CARP IS PROPOSING TO THE REGULATION AND ITS CURRENT REGULATORY PACKAGE -- THE FIRST THING IS RELIGIOUS THE THE PROGRAM TARGETS THEMSELVES OF THE LEVEL OF CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION THAT ARE -- IN THE REGULATION. AND THE SOLID BLACK LINE THAT YOU SEE KIND OF SHOWS THE CURRENT REGULATION AND THE LEVEL OF CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION -- STANDARD THAT'S IN THAT REGULATION. I YOU CAN SEE -- THAT THERE'S A PRETTY STEEP DECLINE AND SORT OF THE THE CARBON INTENSITY REQUIREMENTS -- COME BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY OTHERS THE 10% REDUCTION STANDARD THAT IT'S KIND OF IN THE CURRENT REGULATION THAT WOULD CONTINUE OUT. TO TWENTY THIRTY ARE THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE DOTTED LINE AND THE CHART -- YOU CAN SEE IS OUT LESS STRINGENT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO FOR NOW 201-8 THROUGH OTHER EARLY TWENTY TWENTIES. AND THEN -- BUT THEN SORT OF ESTABLISHES THESE LONGER TERM TARGETS ON CARBON INTENSITY CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTIONS OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY TWO A 20% REDUCTION OUT. TO TWENTY THIRTY SO -- THAT I THINK THE RATIONALE AND OF THAT -- CARB IT'S PRESENTED IS REALLY THAT KIND OF THIS APPROACH WOULD AT TEND TO SORT OF SMOOTH -- SOME OF THE PRICES OUT OVER THE LONG RUN -- AND STABILIZE SOME OF THE INCENTIVES AND PROVIDE MORE STABLE INCENTIVES -- FOR FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATION AND ALSO PREVENT SOME POTENTIALLY SOME SHORT TERM PRICE SPIKES IN THE NEAR TERM. WILL ALSO AND OF A TRADING LONGER TERM REDUCTIONS AS PART OF THE THAT STATE'S OVERALL GOAL TO MEET ITS TWENTY THIRTY GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS. SO ARE YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN OF YOUR HANDOUTS -- LET ME TOUCH ON ALL THE OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES DELTA HIGHLIGHT KIND OF THE FIRST TWO THAT ARE HERE -- THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO CREATE A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE CREDIT SO. THAT WOULD BE KIND OF CREDITS AVAILABLE FOR NEW HYDROGEN AND DC FAST CHARGER ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS -- SO THOSE CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE. ARE BASED ON SORT THE CAPACITY OF THOSE NEW FUELING STATIONS. I AND I THINK IT'S A SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THIS IS A A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM KIND OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN OPERATED TO DATE WHICH IS REALLY. THAT THERE'S A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING AND THE COMPETENCY IS SUCH A WITH PROVIDING THE ACTUAL FUEL AND THEIR CREDITS ARE TIED TO KIND OF PROVIDING THAT FUEL OR IMPLEMENT SOME PROJECT. THE KIND OF REDUCES THOSE EMISSIONS IN THIS CASE -- THERE'S SOMETHING OF A SHIFT WHERE CREDITS WILL BE PROVIDED BY JUST HAVING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE THAT COULD PROVIDE THE FUEL EVEN IF IT'S NOT ACTUALLY. PROVIDING PROVIDING THAT FEELS THAT TOOK A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PHILOSOPHICAL A SHIFT IN THE PROGRAM -- AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THAT THERE ARE EXCUSE ME THE SECOND -- PROPOSED CHANGE THAT IS HIGHLIGHTED HERE IS JUST CHANGING SOME OF THE FUELS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM AND CAN -- FOR EXAMPLE GENERATE CREDITS TO THE PROGRAM SO -- THERE WOULD BE A CHANGE OF WHAT HAD FOR EXAMPLE ALTERNATIVE JET FUEL WOULD NOW BE SORT OF AN ELIGIBLE FUEL FOR THE PROGRAM WHERE IT COULD -- GENERATE CREDITS ASSOCIATED WITH SORT OF LOWER CARBON JET FUEL AND RIGHT NOW THAT'S THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM -- AND I THINK UP PRICE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE -- ELEVEN JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON A FEW ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS YOU -- A UNDERTAKE YOUR YOUR OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES ARE THE FIRST WHICH WAS -- I THINK SCENE IN ONE OF THE OTHER -- CHARTS THE REPRESENTED EARLIER BUT NOW IS WORTH HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE FUELS A STATEWIDE HAS REDUCED SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN. SO AVERAGE CARBON INTENSITY HAS DECREASED BY MORE THAN 3% FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REDUCTIONS. LITTLE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DUE TO LTFS VERSES SOME OTHER PROGRAMS BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT NET SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF IT PROBABLY IS RELATED TO LCF US -- THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT -- LTFS. LIKELY AS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES -- MEAN JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF CREDIT PRICES FOR LCF AS COMPARED TO ALLOWANCE PRICES IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. BOTH OF WHICH ARE AT LEAST IN THEORY SORT OF MANTRA FLECKED. THE COST OF ENCOURAGING THAT ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTION NEEDED TO MEET THE STANDARD IN THE PROGRAM. ACCREDIT PRICES AN LCI FASTS ARE YOU KNOW ROUGHLY. HUNDRED FIFTY I DOLLARS -- AROUND THAT -- CAPTURED ALLOWANCE PRICES ARE FIFTEEN DOLLARS SO THERE'S SORT OF A TEN FOLD EARLY ON THERE'S THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE -- AND JUST AND CONCEPTS -- I THINK SORT OF ECONOMIST SORT OF WHY A DATE. ANY OFTEN TEND TO PREFER SORT OF ECONOMY WIDE PRICING LIKE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THE LOW CARBON FUELS -- STANDARD ONLY TARGET CERTAIN TYPE. I'M GOING BACK TO THIS THIS POLICY IS REALLY TARGETED JUST AT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF FUELS. BUT REALLY SORT OF NO INCENTIVES FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY OR IN OTHER WAYS -- AND SO THERE MIGHT BE SORT OF LOW COST OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT JUST THIS PROGRAM DOESN'T -- SPIT KLAY -- ENCOURAGING SO IN ON SOMEBODY THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW -- MIGHT NOT TO CAPTURE A SOME OF THE OTHER LOW COST OPPORTUNITIES THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM MIGHT -- THERE ARE NOW WITH THAT SAID I MEAN THERE ARE SOME OTHER CRITERIA THAT'S THE LEGISLATURE WILL PROLLY WANT TO CONSIDER WHEN ASSESSING THE PROGRAM SO SOME OF THE OTHER STATED GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM ARE FOR EXAMPLE TO DIVERSIFY THE FUEL MIX -- AND PROMOTE INNOVATION AND FUELS ON SORT OF IN SOME CASES MAYBE THOSE FIELDS COULD BE -- TO SORT OF THE INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND THOSE FUELS -- CAN HELP SORT LOWER COSTS FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND PRINT PERHAPS I'LL ALLOW THEM. TO A USE LOWER CARBON FUELS AND REDUCE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GLOBALLY -- AND REDUCE COAL POLLUTANT SO THAT THOSE ARE OTHER FACTORS AND SORT OF STATED GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM -- AND THE LEGISLATURE JUST NEED TO KIND OF EVALUATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS PROGRAM DOES ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S WORTH WHATEVER. ADDITIONAL COSTS MIGHT AND YOU KNOW REDUCTION AND COST EFFECTIVENESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE ALTERNATE GOALS THAT -- THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE TO THE LETTERS. AND THEN FINALLY A REAL QUICKLY ON THE CREDIT CLEARING MARKET -- AND I THINK ARE AT LEAST KIND INITIAL TAKE ON HAVING REVIEWED THE CREDIT CLAIM MARKET IS THAT YOU KNOW DOESN'T UNLIKE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHICH RECENT LEGISLATION LAST YEAR SORT OF REQUIRED A HARD PRICE CEILING ON THE ON THE CREDITS OR ALLOWANCES THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. OUT THIS MECHANISM DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THAT SAME TYPE OF STRUCTURE -- YEAH THERE'S NO SORT OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY OF CREDITS THAT THE OF THAT STATE WILL BE ISSUING AN ORDER TO SERVE ENSURE PRICES STABLE OUR PARTICULAR. LEVEL SO IN THAT WAY IT DOESN'T WORK CREATE BE KIND OF HARD CAP THAT YOU HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER. NOT CLIMATE POLICY MECHANISMS THAT WE HAVE A DOES -- BUT THERE IS I THINK IT IS WORTH NOTING THERE IS SOME OTHER FLEXIBILITY AND THE PROGRAM WHERE -- IF AN ENTITY IS UNABLE TO KIND OF OBTAIN ENOUGH CREDITS TO COVER ITS DEFICITS IN A PARTICULAR YEAR. THEN THERE'S SORT OF A A A WINDOWS SORT OF FIVE YEAR WINDOW WHERE YOU THINK THEY CAN KIND OF CARRY OVER THAT DEFICIT. THINKER SOME INTEREST BUT THEY CAN KIND OF THE NOTHING GET ENOUGH ALLOWANCES OR CREDITS IN A FUTURE YEAR THINKING OUT OF USE THOSE TO COMPLY SO THEIR SON. AND FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO IT THAT IT'S INTO AND CREDIT PRICES -- BUT THERE'S NOTHING SORT OF OVER THE LONG TERM IF -- THE LEVEL CREDITS ARE SORT OF INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR THOSE CREDITS THAT WOULD PREVENT PRICES FROM -- FROM -- FROM EXCEEDING THAT TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP THAT'S IN THE THE CREDIT CLEARANCE MARKET. SO -- THAT'S MY ATTEMPTED AND RUNNING THROUGH THE LC HAVE BEST PROGRAM VERY QUICKLY I'M SURE YOU HAVE. QUESTIONS FOR ME AND OTHERS ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. THAT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OVERVIEW -- BUT LET ME. GIVE A COLLEAGUES OPPORTUNITY IF HEY WANT TO SAY ANYTHING -- NOW IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET IN THE QUESTIONS OKAY. TWITTER THAT THANK YOU MISTER MISTER BROWN I APPRECIATE THAT THE OVERVIEW. WE'RE LOOKING AT I JUST. ALWAYS LOTS OF QUESTIONS. BUT IN AND APPRECIATE YOU STARTED OFF BY SAYING THAT THE LA EYES THAT LOOKED -- AT LC OFFENSIVE DEATH IT YUBA YOU'VE DONE THIS YOU PREPARED THIS WEEK WE APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND ONE OF YOU. FIRST BEGINNING YOU TALKED ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEFICITS EXCEED CREDITS OF THE MARKET SYSTEM. I WAS JUST WONDERING ITALY THAT WAS YOUR SLIDE ON PAGE. PAGE FORWARD AND THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT WE SEE IN THE I WAS JUST. ONE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU SEE THE AVOID EVERY SAID THE DEFICITS THE INCREASE IN THE DEFICITS CORRECT. SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN YOU SEE THAT INCREASE BUT WAS AT ALL RELATED BECAUSE OF THE COURT CASE WHO WAS. OVER THE OTHER. FACTORS THAT -- THE WEB I MEAN I BELIEVE THE THEY GONNA BIGGEST EXPLANATIONS FOR THE INCREASE IN DEFICIT THAT REALLY I MEAN YOU KIND OF SEEN THE A STANDARD THAT SOME PLACE THE SORT OF BENCHMARK A CARBON INTENSITY STANDARD. GOING DOWN SO THE OTHERS SORT OF YOU KNOW THAT THIS STANDARD BECOMES MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME AND SO THAT MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE FOR SORT OF A GIVEN LEVEL OF OF GASOLINE SUPPLIED -- YOU'RE GENERATING SORT OF MORE DEFICITS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A SORT OF A YOU KNOW GIVEN CARBON INTENSITY UPS OR GASOLINE LET'S SAY. YOU'RE GENERATING JUST MORE DEFICITS FOR THE GIVEN LEVEL AS THE SORT OF STANDARD RATCHETS DOWN AND SO I THINK THAT'S AT THE BIG EXPLANATION I MEAN YOU KNOW. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT JUST LEVEL DEFICITS ARE ALSO JUST THE OVERALL CONSUMPTION OF DIFFERENT FUELS SO IF NO MORE FUELS ARE BEING. ART MORE HIGHER CARBON FIELD IN PARTICULAR BEING -- CONSUME THEM THAT THAT INCREASES THE OF THEIR THE STANDARD BECOMING MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME AND THAT RESULTS IN ALL ELSE EQUAL MORE DEFICITS. MONTH AS WE REACH TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT. GOTTEN ORDER THE REVIEWS THAT WERE EXPECTING THAT TO GENERATE FROM. FROM JUST THE CREDITS -- SO THERE'S THERE'S NO REAL KIND OF STATE REVENUE -- ASSOCIATE WITH THIS SO THEY CAN A MENTION THAT THIS WAS GONNA THROUGHOUT ITS ALL SORT OF MARK QUEEN. BETWEEN VARIOUS PARTIES THAT ARE PART OF THE REGULATION. I AND I THINK WE JUST WE DID SOME KIND OF ROUGH BACK OF THE ENVELOPE. NUMBERS ON SORT OF YOU KNOW AT AT CREDIT PRICES OF HUNDRED DOLLARS AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE ROUGHLY. TEN MILLION CREDITS GENERATED AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH THAT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SORT OF VALUE AND LCF CREDITS THAT WERE GENERATED. SO ANY OTHER VALUE THOSE CHANGES OVER TIME SO THAT YEAH THERE'S NOT THAT ROUGH AMBER BUT ARGUED THAT GIVES YOU A TOTAL GENERAL SENSE I THINK. GOT IT NOW DOES THE LC IF ASKED COMPLEMENT EXISTING PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS INTENDED TO REDUCE GHG YOU TALKED ABOUT IT I KNOW TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. I YOU MENTIONED CAP AND TRADE BUT KNOW IS IT THIS IS THE BEST USE OF TACKLING -- THOSE REGULATORY GOALS. YEAH I MEAN I GUESS -- IT'S IT'S CUMPLIR HITS COMPLICATED I GOT SOME IN THERE ARE KIND OF COMPLICATED -- INTERACTION IN ON THE ONE HAND. YOU'VE THEIR OTHER POLICIES THAT TARGET OTHER PARTS OF KIND OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR LIKE VEHICLE EFFICIENCY AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND SO THIS KIND OF THING YOU KNOW CATCHES THAT THIRD. LAGGED -- I THINK AT A HIGHER LEVEL THOUGH -- NEAR THE THE KIND OF CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WE SEE AS SORT OF THE YOU KNOW IT SHOULD BE SORT OF A CENTRAL PIECE OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE BALL GOAL -- KIND OF POLICIES -- IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT'S LIKELY THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE -- I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THE REASONS WHICH WE HAVE THE COMMITTEE WILL WANT TO KIND OF ASSASSIN ENGAGED AS A KIND OF ASSESSES. THE THE LCF ASSN KIND OF THE ROLE THAT YOU PLAY AS IN OTHER CASES WHERE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T ENCOURAGE FOR WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T KIND OF PUSH ENOUGH INNOVATION IN A PARTICULAR AREA IN A PARTICULAR. A SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY FOR FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER AND SO IT WAS THEIR NEED FOR AN ADDITIONAL POLICY THAT KIND OF HELPS. PUSH THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR FOR WHAT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER -- AND AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS HAVE YOU KNOW THAT. WE THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF THE QUESTIONS TO BE ASKING AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE VALUE OF OF HAVING SOME OF THESE OTHER POLICIES ON TOP OF CAP AND TRADE I GUESS THAT THE FINAL THING IS. NOW COVENTRY DOESN'T COVER ALL EMISSIONS AND SO ON THE OTHER MISSIONS KIND OUTSIDE OF THE CAP WHICH ENDS IN SOME OF THOSE EMISSIONS ARE. A AND REDUCTIONS IN THOSE EMISSIONS ARE BEING INCENTIVIZE BY SOME OF THE LTFS OF SOME OF THE METHANE EMISSIONS FROM. THE AGRICULTURAL AND AREAS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW YOU THERE ARE SOME SORT OF INCENTIVES IN THIS PROGRAM TO DO KIND OF ENCOURAGE. EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THAT AREA AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE THERE IS SORT OF A ROLE FOR OTHER POLICIES TO KIND OF THEIR DEATH FOR HIS ROLE FOR THE POLICIES. TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE THOSE TYPES THE REDUCTIONS GOT SO FROM YOUR ANALYSIS THE WAY YOU'VE LOOKED AT IT THOUGH IN TALKING ABOUT LIKE SAY THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. MAN IS ELSIE VESTS A DUPLICATIVE IS ARE WE I MEAN. I THINK THERE THERE ARE DEFINITELY -- SOME REDUCTIONS THAT OCCURRED THROUGH THE LCF* PROGRAM THAT'S WHERE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE KIND OF YOUNG TRADING LASTS -- NO GASOLINE CONSUMPTION THEN -- YET THOSE ARE MISSIONS THAT ARE UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND AS LONG AS IF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS STRINGENT OFTEN BINDING. AND THOSE WOULD HAVE OCCURRED -- ANYWAY ISN'T IT MIGHT JUST BE SORT OF MIX IT IN YOU KNOW -- SORT OF SHUFFLING EMISSION REDUCTIONS AROUND -- THAT SAID AS THEY GONNA MENTION I MEAN THAT THERE ARE SOME -- RATIONALE FOR HAVING SOME OF THESE OTHER POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU KNOW YOU REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE CAP WHICH THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT WHETHER THIS IS THE THE EXACT RIGHT PROGRAM TO DO THAT IS IS COME ANOTHER QUESTION. OR IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SORT OF PUSH INNOVATION OUR PARTICULAR AREA SO IN THIS CASE AND SORT OF LOW CARBON. FUELS FOR FOR SOME REASON YOU FEEL LIKE SORT OF THEIR YOU KNOW THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OR SOME OF THE OTHER POLICIES ARE GOING TO DO THAT. WELL ENOUGH THEN THERE IS SOME SOME RUSSIAN OUT THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW THAT'S A COMPLICATED ANSWER NINE YOU KNOW I DIDN'T YEAH YEAH I DON'T I DON'T HAVE SORT OF A A DIRECT BUT I THINK THESE ARE JUST SORT OF SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT. NOW THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE WILL I PROBABLY WANT A BALANCE OF THAT SORT OF A ASSESSES THE PROGRAM. YEAH NOTED THAT SOME OF THOSE ARE THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE PRICE FOR THE LC EFFECTS CREDITS AND AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT RIGHT YEAH [inaudible] BECAUSE GOOD DEFENSIVELY MARATHON AS JUST GOING TO SAY I MEAN THAT THE BIGGEST THING WE'RE GETTING ASKED BACK HOME IS WHY ARE WE DOING THIS TWICE. AND YOU KNOW IN IN SOME OF THE SLIDES AND SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIALS YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I ARE YOU CONFUSED BY ALL SELF ES VERSUS KEVIN TRAVERS ALL THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. SO MAKING YOU REALLY JUST KIND OF BREAK THAT DOWN AND THE THE MOST PLAIN LANGUAGE YOU POSSIBLY CAN -- YES OF FOLKS AT HOME CAN UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON BECAUSE OF AND WITH WITH CALIFORNIA WHERE THE HIGHEST REGULATED STATE. INSERTED TO BREAK IT DOWN AND AND FOR US GOING BACK HOME YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO GO LAW THERE'S THIS PROGRAM THAT REGULATES YOU HERE BUT THERE'S THIS PROGRAM THE REGULATION HERE BUT THEY'RE BOTH REGULATING ALONG SOME THE SAME LINES BUT YET DIFFERENT. SO I MEAN JUST KICKING EVERY THAT DOWN FOR THE FOLKS AT HOME LISTENING YEAH I MEAN AND AND THAT I'M PROBABLY NOT THE BEST PERSON TO SORT OF ANSWER YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING IT TWICE A MEANS OF THAT THE OF THE WORD WE DIDN'T COME. TO RECREATE THE PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT. THE IF THE EXPLANATION THAT -- I SEEM TO HEAR MOST OFTEN IS JUST SORT OF YEAH. TO BE SORT OF A SIGNIFICANT PART OF SORT OF THAT THE STATE'S -- KIND OF CLIMATE PUBLIC THEY'VE THEY WILL NEED TO BE SORE THE NEXT THE SINGING PART OF THE STATE'S ENERGY MIX GOING FORWARD AND THERE ARE SORT OF TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES TO KIND OF PROVIDING THOSE TYPES OF LOW CARBON FUELS AND SO. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF AN EXTRA PUSH IN THAT AREA BEYOND WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED AND CAP AND TRADE AND THAT THAT THAT'S IS -- THIS IS KIND OF THE POLICY THAT THAT DOES THAT SOUND ALRIGHT. SO ON THAT I MEAN -- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAN FOR LCF HAS HAS IT GROWN IN STATE PRODUCTION OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS AS WE AND I MEAN THAT THAT'S NOT. A PIECE OF DATA I GUESS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT INDEPTH ME THAT I I THINK IT DOES PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR YOU KNOW -- PRODUCERS BOTH IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE TO TRY AND FIND WAYS TO REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THEIR FUELS. ARM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE SORT OF OFFHAND SORT OF A BREAKDOWN OF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH OF THAT REDUCTION IN THAT SORT THE CREDITS THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED COULD HAVE COME FROM IN STATE VERSES OUT OF STATE NOW? IT'S KIND OF CURIOUS SEE IF THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT IF THERE'S A A CREDIT MARKET FOR IT THEN I WOULD IMAGINE SOME PEOPLE WOULD. RUSHED TOWARDS. TO RUSH TO FILL THAT NEED THAT NAY UNDER CERTAIN LIST OF IT DOES IT DOES PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR YOU KNOW PRODUCING LOWER CARBON FUELS TO TO PRODUCERS THAT ARE -- BETTER AND STATE I DON'T KNOW AND YOU KNOW AND PRACTICE SORT OF HOW MUCH OF THAT. HAS OCCURRED HOW MUCH OF THE REDUCTIONS IN ACCORDANCE YEAH WHICH THAT KINDA GOES INTO -- THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT FOR A REGIONALLY BASED LCF US. NEPHEW LOOKED AT WHAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MEAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR HOW THAT WOULD EVEN BE. TACKLED FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. I AM I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT KIND OF THE ANY PROPOSAL TO END OF REGIONALIZED THE LCF ES UM. I THINK THAT MY SHORT SORT OF INITIAL RESPONSES THAT YOU KNOW IT COULD BE MATTER QUITE COMPLICATED -- I'M AND I THINK WE WERE SEEN AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANALOGY TO KIND OF THE CAP AND TRADE MARKET IS NO TO SOME CHALLENGES WITH. KIND OF TRYING DEBT TO LINK PROGRAMS WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND YA FATE CHANGE COURSE YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THOSE CHANGES HOW HE SORT COORDINATE PROGRAMS BETWEEN. A DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS CREATES JUST. A BIT OF A CHALLENGE BUT I MEAN THERE THERE COULD BE POTENTIAL TO TO THE EXTENT YOU'RE LINKING. A KIND OF ENCOURAGING THE THE LOWEST CARBON -- HEARD THE LOWEST COST SORT OF A MISSION THEY'RE ON BUT THAT'S JUST SORT OF MY CONCEPTUAL FIRST TAKE ON THE ISSUE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT HAPPENING MORE AT THIS POINT. GOT IT I APPRECIATE THAT -- SO BASED OFF OF WHAT YOU HAVE ANALYZE YOU KNOW AGAIN EVERY SAID. DID LOOK AT IT COMPLETELY AND DEATH. BUT WATER BECAUSE SOME OF THE LEADING ANSWERED WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE CARBON INTENSITY PRODUCTION TIMELINE. A PROPOSED BY AIR BE -- I MEAN. I ICE I SUSPECT THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONCERNS FROM OUR OFFICE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST THAT THE STANDARD. I WOULD GO OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY AND WOULD GO DOWN TO YOUR 20% REDUCTION STANDARD BY TWENTY THIRTY AND SO I THINK -- I SPECTACLE OF WE KNOW ONE OF THE THE LEADING CONCERNS WOULD BE JUST KNOW IT'S THERE WILL THERE BE ENOUGH. AND OF LOWER COST -- FUELS AVAILBLE IN ORDER TO MEET THAT STANDARD YARDS THAT WHAT AT WHAT ARE THE THE COST GOING TO BE IN ORDER TO MEET THE THE LONG TERM STANDARD WILL BE SORT OF ENOUGH -- LOW COST FUELS AN EMISSION REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THAT STANDARD -- YOU IN THE NEAR TERM THAT THE STANDARD IS A BIT LESS STRINGENT AND SO SORT OF THE OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE NOT THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT OVER THE LONG TERM I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S THAT CONSTRUCTING THIS RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN. THE COSTS AND THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS OF THAT THE STATE WANTS TO ACHIEVE. MAYBE I'LL ASK ONE OF OUR LATER PANEL THAT SAME QUESTION. WITH RATE WITH THAT -- IT IT BRINGS ME BACK -- TO TRANSPORTATION HEARING WE HAD WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THERE WANTING. TO THEY EXTEND THE DATES FROM. TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY FIFTY THE STAINING THAT TIMELINE I MEAN WE'VE GOT THE PROGRAM WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING SET UP IN IN IN MARCH THAN EVERYBODY IN INDUSTRIES RT. YOU KNOW PLANNING EVERYTHING OUT SO I MEAN. BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT DOES EXTEND IN THAT PROGRAM JAM BECAUSE THEY COULD COMPLETELY CHANGE ALL THE TARGETS -- AND I APOLOGIZE JUST IT JUST TO CLARIFY MISS HER ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO WE TALKING ABOUT THAT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OR THE LCF US CAP AND TRADE YEAH. OKAY -- YEAH I MEAN YEAH RIGHT NOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS SET ITS GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY AND THAT'S KIND OF AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY I MEAN I THINK. YANICK EXTENSION BEYOND THAT REQUIRE SOME LEGISLATIVE ASSESSMENT OF CUT WHERE IT WOULD LIKE TO SET ITS TARGETS AND IF IT DOES YOU KNOW IF IT DOES HAVE SORT OF AMBITIONS. FOR MORE AGGRESSIVE LONGER TERM GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS THAT WE THINK YOU KNOW HAVING A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO HELP ACHIEVE THAT MAKES. A LOT OF SENSE BUT THAT'S A A BIG SORT OF POLICY DISCUSSION THAT THE LEGISLATURE. I SHOULD HAVE AND I THINK THERE IS GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN. OUT OF THAT ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN YOU KNOW SHOULD SHOULD BE GIVEN EARLIER WHICH PROVIDE SOME MORE MARKET CERTAINTY YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT YOUR SORT OF PROVIDING LONGER TERM TARGET SOME LONGER TERM AUTHORITY THAT DOES PROVIDE. SOME BENEFIT FOR MARKET CERTAINTY BUT NOBODY YET THE LEGISLATURE ALSO OR THAT ONLY THAT AND THAT WOULD USE THE GOALS OF THOSE. YOU'VE GOT BOND GOING ONE WAY AND ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY. I MEAN IT CHANGES THINGS A LOT. YEAH I MEAN IT WILL YOU KNOW. IT MAKES SENSE TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS AND SORT OF THE CONTEXT OF IT WHAT WHAT IS THIS SORT OF SWEET OF POLICIES DO WE DO WE THINK ARE GOING TO BE USED IN OUR SORT OF REASONABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE AND ACHIEVE ALL THE DIFFERENT GOALS THAT. THAT WE HAVE IN PARTICULAR THE GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND AND HOW THEY SORT OF YEAH AROUND IT AND I KNOW. THE BURKE KIND OF PUT YOU ON THE SPOT WITH THAT BUT NOW I MEAN I THINK THESE ARE ALL KIND OF GOOD QUESTION YOU KNOW HOW KIND OF HOW FAR OUT TO SET YOUR GOALS WHICH POLICIES. ARE DO YOU THINK ARTS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS. ARE YOU HOW ARE THEY ALL SORT OF IN IRAQ CONFLICT TOGETHER ALL SORT OF VERY GOOD QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW -- YET DESERVE A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE THOUGHT IN CONSUMER GUIDE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE ALWAYS HAVE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INTO FOR MECHANICS WORKING AND HOW DO WE FIT ALL THOSE TOGETHER AND AND KEEP THINGS RIGHT AND THE RIGHT WAY. GINGERLY PUT AFFORDABLE YEAH YEAH I MEAN I I I I CAN'T AGREE MORE AND I THINK TO SORT OF GET GIVEN SOME MY TESTIMONY I THINK -- HOPEFULLY SORT OF JUST THE COMPLEXITY AND SORT OF YOU KNOW HOW FITTING ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES TOGETHER -- IT'S SORT OF YOU KNOW -- HIGHLIGHTS KIND OF THE NEED TO TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE ARE COORDINATED AND THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE BEST PATH FORWARD WHAT'S THE BEST MIX OF POLICIES. GOT AND AS WE START HAVING THOSE GOALS AND TURN AND REACH THOSE THAT THOSE EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD ASK YOU THIS IF YOU SAW THE ANALYSIS PROSTHETICS PANEL. BUT HOW MANY HOW MANY OTHER PRODUCER GAS PRODUCERS I GUESS ARE MEETING THOSE BY PLEDGING THEIR FUELS AS OPPOSED. TO ANOTHER MECHANISM BE THERE BY HER CREDITS. DID YOU SEE THAT IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF NOT I CAN PROBABLY ASKED NEXT PANEL -- THAT YOU'RE SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE THEY PROBABLY DO HAVE SOME MORE DETAILED INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT CHART ON PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT GIVES YOU. THE LEAST IN BROAD STROKES KIND OF THE SOURCE OF THE CREDITS THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED SO FAR -- YOU KNOW AND SO THE BIGGEST PIECE OF THAT SO FAR HAS BEEN NOTHING ALL THAT YOU SEE SOME INCREASES AND QUITE A FEW OTHER TYPES OF FUELS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO GENERATE CREDIT SO FAR SO. BOTH IN EACH ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES THERE'S RIGHT IF -- I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS WOULD NOT HAVE SOME MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THAT GOT. I APPRECIATE THAT SO. MY OF GOD I JUST JUST COULD MY WIFE MENTION THIS TO ME THE OTHER DAY THAT THERE'S A QUORUM SHORTAGE GOING ON AND YOU CAN'T BUY CORN ON THE COB AGO SHE SHORING HOUSE OF THE INCREASE IN ETHANOL AFFECTING THAT. I DON'T KNOW [inaudible] I YEAH -- GROCERY STORE DISCUSSION. I I I I DON'T KNOW I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TRYING TO KIND OF LOOK INTO IT BUT I I I CAN'T SAY THAT I KNOW THE ANSWER THAT. GOT IT -- NIGHT [inaudible] INTERESTING QUESTION OF BUT PROCEDURE LOOKING INTO THIS MISTER RATHER THAN OBVIOUSLY AS I AIR REVIEW GETS TO ROLL OUT -- THEIR REGULATIONS AND AS WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER SOME OF THOSE POLICY DISCUSSION WE MAY MAKE CALL ON THE LA THOUGH TO LOOK. A LITTLE BIT FURTHER IN DEPTH AND HELPLESS. LOOK IN A NONPARTISAN MANNER -- INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS WE THAT CONTINUE TO NOT ONLY LOOK AT THE REDUCTIONS BUT ALSO THE COSTA. THE COST AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS SPECIAL WE HAVE OTHER PROGRAMS OF SEEM TO BE DUPLICATING SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS. WE THE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM RUNNING PROGRAM THAT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS A AS A POLICY MAKERS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT WITH THAT [inaudible] BEFORE WE INCLUDE I WOULD ASK IF THERE'S ANY LAST MINUTE QUESTIONS FROM. ANY OF THE MEMBERS. HEARING INSING KNOWLEDGE WAS A THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND THAT IF SOMEBODY WANTS A COPY -- HAVE WHICH PROVIDES US ALL THE LA WEBSITE. IT IS IT IS IT IS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. VERY MEMBERS IS GOING TO MOVE -- TO PANEL BE WHICH IS A REGULATED PARTIES -- FIRST ROLL I BEGIN WITH TESTIMONY BY KATHERINE RESPOND A PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. AND NEXT WE HAVE DINA KAPOOR FROM CAL COALITION FOR NATURAL GAS. AND THEN I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP A NEW COLLAR CO PACIFIC ETHANOL. AND FINALLY WILL HAVE JOKER XIN REPRESENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED. BIOFUELS A ALLIANCE WE HAVE ALL YOU GUYS COME UP TO SHE TO GUYS BEING HERE WITH US FOR FIRST. HEARING -- BUT LET'S COULDN'T HIDE HIS WILL BEGIN WHAT TESTIMONY OF THAT AFTERWARDS WE JUST AWESOME GENERAL QUESTIONS THE ENTIRE PANEL THAT'S OKAY HAS VERY ALRIGHT. IT'S GOOD TO BEGIN THANK YOU. BOTH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SALICIN MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE I'M CATHY REVISED BOYD PRESIDENT THE WESTERN STATES PATROLMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND I REPRESENT THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS AND REFINERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO BE HERE AND REALLY THANK THE COMMITTEE AND AND YOU CHAIRMAN SALAS FOR HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE FOR ALL OF US TO HAVE -- AND BEFORE I TURN TO THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD I JUST WANNA. NOTE BOMB RELATIVE TO RELATIONS A GROWING ENEMY THAT WE ALL HAVE -- U. S. POLICYMAKERS US AS INDUSTRY LEADERS WE REALLY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD A VIBRANT ENERGY FUTURE FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE. AND THAT MEANS SAFE SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE ENERGY THAT'S AVAILABLE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE IN ELECTRICITY NATURAL GAS AND TRANSPORTATION FEELS SO ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT -- WERE WORKING ON A GOOD COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN I THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME STRIDES BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LINKAGES BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE. AS YOU HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS AYE DISCUSSION IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT SO. I THINK FOCUSING A LITTLE BIT ON A COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN FOR THE STATE GOING FORWARD WILL BE ANOTHER REALLY GOOD THING FOR US TO DO. I AM ETERNALLY BUT NOW TO THE HEAVIEST LEGAL OKKERVIL STANDARD THE SUBJECT OF THIS. AND LAST YEAR YOU ALL KNOW S. B. THREE NINETY EIGHT EXTENT CAP AND TRADE WITH SOME PRETTY AGGRESSIVE GOALS. BUT THEY HAD A VERY KEEN FOCUS YOU ALL HAD A KEEN FOCUS AND WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT EXTENSION ON COST CONTAINMENT. AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE WE'VE DONE ALL THE EASY THINGS EVERYTHING ELSE WE DO NOW IS REALLY EXPENSIVE IN WHATEVER PROGRAM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SPECIFICALLY IN THIS. ONE AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUSINESSES CAN STILL OPERATE AND THE CONSUMERS. WHO ARE -- THE YOU KNOW REALLY GETTING IMPACTED FROM ALL THESE POLICIES ON CAN SUPPORT THIS GOING FORWARD IF WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM. SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING I WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BECAUSE DISCUSSION ITS TO REALLY KEEP A KEEN EYE ON COST CONTAINMENT LIKE YOU DID IN CAP AND TRADE. BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IT'S INSUFFICIENT IN THIS PROGRAM TO ACTUALLY SUSTAIN IT GOING FORWARD. WE REMAIN PRETTY CONCERNED ABOUT -- ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE FUEL SUPPLIES THAT AVAILABLE TO ALL CONSUMERS AND WE SAY THAT IT'S EVERY REGION. AND IT'S EVERY SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALL OF THAT IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU ON ALL THIS IS ONE OF THREE OF THE POLICIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DEALS IN IN -- CLIMATE CHANGE EMISSIONS AS REFINERS WERE CERTAINLY LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES. SORE SUBJECT CAP AND TRADE -- WERE SUBJECT TO TRANSPORTATION FUELS UNDER CAP AND TRADE WHETHER WE MAKE IT HERE WE IMPORT AND AND SO NOW YOU HAVE ON TOP THAT OF COURSE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. I PROGRAM AT THINK THEY'LL LEO DID A GREAT JOB IN TRYING. TO SIMPLIFY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHICH IS A REALLY COMPLEX PROGRAM MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LCS F. S. MEANS AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT PREVIOUS CONVERSATION -- BUT THIS IS A LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS PROGRAM RATED INCLUDES ELECTRICITY IN THE REFINING PROCESS IT IT INCLUDES -- IRRIGATION FROM BIOFUELS INCLUDES FERTILZERS -- AND SO IT'S NOT A TAILPIPE EMISSION PROGRAM RIGHT WE'VE DONE A LOT THERE WITH THEIR BE WE'VE HAD WHAT THREE QUICKLY TO BRING GASOLINE PROGRAMS. PATROLS OVER DIESEL. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REQUIRES US TO MAKE THE CLEANEST BURNING GASOLINE AND DIESEL ON THE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH SO. IT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS ON THE CARBON INTENSITY AND IT WAS A DISCRETE EARLY ACTION OF YOU KNOWS ADOPTION TOOK TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT IT'S BEEN AFFECT FOR TEN YEARS. RIGHT THE COMPLIANCE CURVE AS WE HEARD WAS BACK END LOADED THAT MEANS THAT PERCENTAGE IS PUSHED OUT IN THE OUT YEARS AND THAT'S FOR VERY GOOD REASON IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE LETTING. LOSI AYE FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCE PROGRAM. BUT WORD ABOUT THREE POINT 5%. TODAY RIGHT THAT'S THE REQUIREMENT AND LIVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO EVEN GET TO THE ORIGINAL 10% BUT TWENTY TWENTY AND NOW OF COURSE THE RB IS LOOKING AT EXTENDING THAT 218% OUT -- TO TWENTY THIRTY YOU KNOW FOR THE MOST PART IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS WE MEET THAT BY BLENDING LOWER SEE AYE ETHANOL BIODIESEL AND RENEWABLE DIESEL. BUT THAT'S AT THIS LOW LEVEL THREE POINT 5% [inaudible] SO. I WOULD SAY THAT YOU FOR BE SAID BEFORE IN THE IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WE ALL KNOW YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE PEOPLE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE WAKE UP TOMORROW. CAN EXPECT THREE THINGS FROM ALL OF US. YOU KNOW THEY EXPECT TO TURN THE LIGHTS ON HIDDEN COOLER HOMES AND DRIVE FOR ME TO BE AFFORDABLE. AND SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS IN THE COMPREHENSIVE SENSE OF ALL THESE PROGRAMS. YET. IT'S ITS NOT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THIS CONGRESS IS THAT IF WE'RE GONNA BE THE COMPETITIONS REALLY HOWARD AND IN THAT CONVERSATION. I'M SO PLEASED TO TWENTY THIRTEEN TARGETS A PRETTY DAUNTING RIGHT THE GO 18% OUT TO THE FUTURE. AND I DON'T WANNA BE A BROKEN RECORD BUT AGAIN COST CONTAINMENT IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THIS PROGRAM AT THIS A DISCUSSION. PLEASE FOCUSED ON COST CONTAINMENT FOR THIS PROGRAM LIKE YOU'VE DONE AND LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. RIGHT NOW I THINK YOU HEARD THE ILIO SAY THAT CREDIT PRICE FOR LOOK COVERAGE FEEL SAD ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS -- PER METRIC TON. AS COMPARED CAP AND TRADE FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER METRIC TON. SO YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM IS FAIRLY EXTENSIVE THAT'S A 90% INCREASE. IN AVERAGE CREDIT PRICE IN JUST A YEAR AGO. SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING TO DO REAL YOU TAKE. TAKE A WE'RE TAKING NOTE OF IT -- AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN OVER THE PAST GAS TAX OF TWELVE CENTS A GALLON FOR GASOLINE TWENTY CENTS FOR DIESEL. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT IN ADDITION TO LOW CARBON FEEL STAND AND WE I JUST LOOK AT THE SUBMIT THIS MORNING ON OPUS AND CHECK WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION. FOR LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD GASOLINE IS ANOTHER TWELVE POINT THREE CENTS A GALLON DIESEL EIGHT POINT FOUR CENTS A GALLON. OKAY THAT'S ON TOP OF A GAS TAX NOW CAP AND TRADE. ANOTHER ELEVEN NINE CENTS PER GALLON FOR GASOLINE AND FOURTEEN CENTS PER POUND FOR DIESEL. SO YOU START STACKING UP THESE PROGRAMS. THAT'S WHY I SAY FOR SUSTAINABILITY. THE BUSINESSES HAVE TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE. WHO USE ALL OF THE FUELS AND THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A PROGRAM? BECAUSE IT'S COST EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE USE START STACKING UP THOSE COSTS IT BECOMES PRETTY CONCERNING FOR NOT ONLY BUSINESSES BUT FOR CONSUMERS SO AGAIN. COST CONTAINMENT COST CONTAINMENT. WHEN WE LOOK AT STAFF -- AIR BE STAFF ASSESSMENT FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ARE BEFORE US -- THIS YEAR THE INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY THIRTY IS IN EXCESS OF EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S THE COST OF COMPLIANCE IN THE OUT YEARS OF THE PROGRAM. THE SAME STAFF ASSESSMENT. AND THAT SHOULD CONCERN US EQUALLY AS MUCH SHOWS THAT TWO THIRDS OF THAT COST OF COMPLIANCE. FLOWS OUT OF THE STATE BUSINESSES OUT OF STATE BUSINESSES. SO SOME IS BENEFITING FROM IT BUT IT'S DIFFERENT NOT NECESSARILY -- PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SO -- IT INCREASES COSTS THE CONSUMER. GENERATES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUT EXPORTS THE BULK OF THAT. OUT OF THE STATE. SO I LOOK AT ALL OF THEM I KNOW ONE THING THERE'S DEFINITELY ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS PROGRAM [inaudible] OKAY. I'M NOW IT CERTAINLY CAN BE YOU KNOW THINGS CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT IT -- WE ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN TWO OF THOSE THAT ARE -- BEING TALKED ABOUT AS WE SPEAK WHICH WERE SUPPORTIVE OF AND THAT IS THE REFINERY INVESTMENT CREDIT. AND CARBON CAPTURE SEQUESTRATION. WE ACTUALLY ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE YOU CANNOT MEET THESE GOALS WITHOUT CCS. THAT IS TAKING CARBON OUT THE ATMOSPHERE AND STARTING ON ROUTE SO THOSE ARE TWO AREAS THAT CAN HELP. ON COST CONTAINMENT BUT THERE HAS TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THIS PROGRAM AND PASS. SO IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO GIVE OBVIOUSLY. THE REST OF MY THE PANEL MEMBERS THAT THERE DO TIME -- WE THINK THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY AND US AND EVERYONE IN THIS CONVERSATION REALLY DOES WANT. A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE BUT IT HAS TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT. ECONOMY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS RIGHT ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS TO WORK SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW WHETHER WE YOU KNOW WHAT TO PROTECT THE PLANET PROTECT PROSPERITY OR PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE RIGHT WE CAN DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS IF WE DO THIS RIGHT AND REALLY FOCUS ON THESE PROGRAMS AND WHAT IT COST. AND HOW THEY LINKED TOGETHER SO -- I THINK WELL BELIEVE WE DON'T HAVE TO SACRIFICE ONE AND AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO THANK THIS HUGE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THIS PANEL IN THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. FOR REALLY TAKING THIS ISSUE UP AND TAKING IT TO HEART BECAUSE THIS IS THESE ARE PORT MATTERS. AND COST TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS CALIFORNIA. REACHES ITS VERY AGGRESSIVE TARGETS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND THE OTHER BE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. THEY SUFFER JUST MONEY WAS GOING AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST WHO WOULD LIKE. TO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SAUCE AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS NINA COMPORT AND THE DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. THE COALITION FOR NEW OF OUR NATURAL GAS IS A FIVE A ONCE HE SIX TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING AND PROVIDING THE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY PLATFORM ADVOCACY BOYS. I NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA OUR MEMBERSHIP IS COMPRISED OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY LEADING COMPANIES. MANY OF WHOM ARE BASED IN OUR OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA I'M INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PRODUCERS OF GREATER THAN 90%. OF ALL THE ARE IN G. PARTICIPATING IN THE AISLE CFS TODAY WE BELIEVE THAT REDEEMING REFUSE THE WASTE THAT SOCIETY PRODUCES FOR PRODUCTIVE AND USES. IS THE EPITOME OF SUSTAINABILITY. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS ALSO KNOWN AS ARE IN G. OR BIO METHANE IS A PRODUCT GAS DRIVE FROM THE BIO GAS OR RAW METHANE. THAT'S EMITTED FROM ORGANIC MATERIALS NATURALLY DECOMPOSING IN RENEWABLE WASTE STREAMS. TODAY OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE DEVELOPED TO CAPTURE AND CONVERT THAT BIOGAS AT LANDFILLS WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES. AND DARIUS AND OTHER LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS IN A WAY THAT ENABLES IT TO BECOME INTERCHANGEABLE WITH GEOLOGIC NATURAL GAS. CLEANING CONDITION BY A GAS IS KNOWN AS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS OR BY AND NOTHING WHICH IS THEN COMPATIBLE WITH CNG ANALOGY VEHICLES. AND CAN BE INJECTED INTO AND TRANSPORTED VIA NATURAL GAS COMMON CARRIER PIPELINES FOR A VARIETY OF AND USES. INCLUDING AS AN ULTRA LOW AND EVEN [inaudible] TEACHING YOUR THE ALTERNATIVE TO CAPTURING AND CONVERTING METHANE FROM THE SOURCES IS FLARING GAS. WHICH COMBUSTS AND WASTE THIS VALUABLE ENERGY RICH RESOURCE EVEN WORSE THAN FLARING IF NOTHING IS COLLECT AT IS NOT COLLECTED THE GAS WILL ESCAPE FUGITIVE LEAD INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT IS EIGHTY FOUR TIMES AS POTENT AS CARBON. AS CARBON DIOXIDE AS A GREENHOUSE GAS -- I'D ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE LCS DIASPORA ON THAT DESPERATE ON THE CURB WEBSITE -- IT HAS DATA ON VARIOUS RENEWABLE FUELS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IS BY FAR THE LOWEST CARBON FUEL AVAILABLE. TO GIVE YOU SOME RIVER YOU'LL FIND THERE AS A BASELINE DIESEL HAS A CARBON INTENSITY LEVEL OF ABOUT A HUNDRED GRAMS FOR MAYBE TWO OF ENERGY. GASOLINE IS AROUND. NINETY ELECTRICITY IN CALIFORNIA WHEN USES VEHICLE FUEL IS ABOUT. THIRTY FIVE THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE THAT'S ALMOST A TWO THIRDS REDUCTION IN CARBON DENSITY COMPARED TO GASOLINE. HOWEVER RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS GOES AS LOW AS NEGATIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE CERTIFIED. WITH OTHER EVENLOWER CARB INTENSELY SCORES FOR IN THE IN THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. THAT'S MORE THAN 210050% REDUCTION WHEN COMPARED TO DIESEL. DRIVING IN NATURAL GAS VEHICLE POWERED BY RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS ACTUALLY HELPS THE ATMOSPHERE AS IT DRIES. THIS IS A LOW CARBON DUAL STANDARDS OF COURSE CARBON IS THE METRIC ON WHICH THERE'S THE MOST FOCUS IN THIS DISCUSSION. BUT I KNOW THIS BUILDING PEOPLE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT KNOX. I WILL ADD HERE THAT A RECENT STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE FOUND THAT VEHICLES FUELED BY OUR ANGIE KNOWN AS NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. OUR NINETY NINE POINT 8% CLEAN IN REGARDS KNOCKS EMISSIONS. THE TRANSLATION IS THAT THERE'S NO MEASURABLE ADDITIONAL IMPACT IN THE METRICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CARES ABOUT AS MY RESPIRATORY DISEASE AND PREMATURE DEATH WHEN COMPARED TO A NEAR. WHEN COMPARED TO IS YOUR MISSION VEHICLE THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN COST THAN A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE? MEAN THAT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLEADS CAN AFFORD MORE CLEAN VEHICLES FOR THE SAME BUDGET. OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES ALSO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL CO BENEFITS BY MITIGATING SOIL AND WATER IMPACTS OF THE SOURCE FACILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE POLLUTION BENEFITS FROM. HAS BEEN SHOWN. TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE EMISSIONS OF SOCKS HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND MONIA AND VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. EACH ORANGEY PROJECT ATTRACTS BETWEEN TEN AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT DEPENDING ON THE FEEDSTOCK. EACH ARE IN G. PROJECT CREATES UP TO A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE DIRECT AND INDIRECT JOBS. WITH ANY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT SPURRED BY THE STATE INCLUDING AS PROPOSED UNDER LEGISLATION BEING CONSIDERED THIS YEAR WE BELIEVE INDUSTRY CAN DEVELOP UP TO THREE HUNDRED NEW AREN'T YOU PREDICT PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND STATE. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT LEGISLATION AND REGULATION THAT HADN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IN SALT TWENTY ELEVEN THE ORANGEY INDUSTRY IS FORCED TO INVEST IN AND BUILD PROJECTS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIANS ARE PS PROGRAM AND SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN THIRTY SEVEN OTHER STATES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRIVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF OUR ENERGY UNTIL. TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THE VALUE OF OUR ENERGY PRODUCED OUT OF STATE WAS REDUCED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA OUR PS. THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF RG PRODUCTION FACILITIES OPERATING IN STATE TODAY. DUE TO RECENT CHANGES IN PIPELINE INDUCTION STANDARDS AND MORE INCENTIVE DOLLARS COMING DOWN OUR MEMBERS ARE INVESTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TODAY IN PROJECTS IN STATE. BUT UNTIL ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES FOR IN STATE PROJECTS THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF NATURAL GAS VEHICLES -- REASONABLE PIPELINE INJECTIONS STANDARDS AND ADDITIONAL MARKET CERTAINTY UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO IMPART MOST OF THE AREN'T YOU CAN SEE ON THIS. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS PLEASE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING ROMEO CFS CREDIT GENERATION BETWEEN -- BIO CNG IN BIO LNG TOTALED TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS A RESULT THIS IS A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT APPROXIMATELY 61% OF NATURAL GAS% USES TRANSPORTATION FUELS TODAY IN CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY ALREADY RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. THIS IS EXPECTED TO REACH 90% WHEN THE LOS ANGELES METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY CONVERTS ITS BUS FLEET TO OUR ENERGY WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR. THE FEDERAL OUR FS AND CALIFORNIA'S OUTFITS LCF US AND THEIR ASSOCIATED MARKETS. HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON IT OUR ENERGY INDUSTRY GROWTH PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION VOLUMES. WHAT WAS AN INDUSTRY WITH ONLY TWO TO THREE DOZEN PROJECTS IN NORTH AMERICA PRIOR TO THE IMPACT OF THE OCF ASSN ARAFAT'S? THESE PROGRAMS HAVE LED TO THE NINE NUMBER OF OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES MORE THAN DOUBLING. AND JUST A FEW YEARS WHILE TRIPLING THE VOLUME OF INDUSTRY PRODUCTION. WE'VE APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD STAFF ON THE PROPOSED TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMENDMENTS A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS. WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM JUNE INTENSITY RED TWENTY THIRTY WE ALSO SUPPORT THE INCLUSION OF A THIRD PARTY VERIFICATION SYSTEM THAT WILL ENSURE THE OVERALL INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM. ONE PRINCIPLE THAT WE HOPE CARP RETAINS AS THE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY OF THE PROGRAM THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS MEANT TO TREAT ALL FEELS EQUALLY. INCENTIVIZING ONLY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR CERTIFIED CARBON INTENSITY. IF I CAN LEAVE YOU WITH ONE MESSAGE TODAY IT'S THAT CALIFORNIA'S LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS WORKING WELL. BETWEEN TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN YA CFS IS HOW TO GENERATE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN AVOIDED HEALTH IMPACTS TWENTY SIX MILLION TONS OF AVOIDED CARBON POLLUTION AND A 57% INCREASE IN THE USE OF CLEAN FUELS. THIS PROGRAM IS WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CARVE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL SECOND PHASE. I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT WILL CONTINUE WITH TESTIMONIES AND WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS PLEASE IF YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SALAS AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. MY NAME IS NEIL CURLER I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF PACIFIC CAPITAL. CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST PRODUCER OF LOW CARBON ETHANOL. WE OPERATE TO ETHANOL PLANTS IN CALIFORNIA AND MARKET THE MAJORITY OF THE ETHANOL PRODUCED IN THE STATE ONE OF THOSE PLANTS AND ASSEMBLY. MEMBER MATHIS IS DISTRICT IN AND PICKS THE CALIFORNIA. SO WERE THE FOR ETHANOL PLANTS -- MAIN ETHANOL PLANTS -- IN IN CALIFORNIA. OF PRODUCE ABOUT [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED TWENTY CITY AND TO AN EARLIER QUESTION IN TERMS OF IN STATE SUPPLY. FROM THE THE ETHANOL WHICH HAS GENERATED SIGNIFICANT CREDIT IN THE PROGRAM A WE'RE PROVIDING IN STATE PRODUCTION OF ABOUT 15%. ALL THE REST IS IMPORTED PRINCIPALLY FROM THE MIDWEST A BUT THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE HERE IN THE STATE. I'M OUR ETHANOL'S AMONG THE LOWEST CARBON SCORED ETHANOL IN THE THE ENTIRE MARKET -- WHO WE AS A COMPANY AND IS A CALIFORNIA ETHANOL INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT A LONG STANDING? SUPPORTERS OF LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE WERE STANDING BY THE SIDE OF THAN ARNOLD GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IN. TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WHEN HE INITIATED THIS PROCESS A THROUGH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER. I SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY ACTIVELY WITH THE COALITION OF LOW CARBON. A FUEL SUPPLIERS LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS IN IN SUPPORTING A VIABLE LCF THAT'S SO VERY A BROAD BASED COALITION THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW A KEY TO THE SUSTAINABILITY IN THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND AND TO THAT POINT OF THE LC OFFICE IS WORKING. TODAY THE LCI PASSES HELPED THE STATE AVOID ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON EMISSIONS. ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO TAKING MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION CARS OFF THE ROAD FOR A YEAR. IT IS DELIVERING. CLEAN AIR GOOD JOBS AND CLEAN FUEL CHOICES TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE CAN HAVE CLEAN FUELS AND GROW OUR ECONOMY I THINK HE'LL CFS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. I IN ETHANOL IS PART OF THE SUCCESSFUL LC OF ITS PROGRAM. HAS PLAYED A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE. NEARLY HALF OF ALL THE L. CFS CREDITS. TO DATE HAVE COME FROM DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED ETHANOL. AND IF WE LOOK LOOK JUST TAKE CREDITS FROM THE GASOLINE POOL THERE'S A GAS AND PULL THE DE SUPPORT. OUR ETHANOL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WELL OVER 80% OF THE CREDITS GENERATED SO REAL WORKHORSE OF THE PROGRAM. I IN ITS TIME IS GONE ON WE SEEN DIVERSIFICATION AND RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS MORE RENEWABLE DIESEL BIODIESEL ELECTRICITY SO THAT'S BEEN A REAL SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM IS THAT WHILE. YOU ETHANOL IN THE EARLY YEARS IS VIRTUALLY ALL THE CREDIT WE'RE NOW SEEING A DIVERSIFICATION INTO OTHER FUEL SOURCES AND AND WE WE A PLOT THAT NOT JUST. ONE ACCEPTABLE OUTCOMES OF THE PROGRAM. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL BIOFUELS INCLUDING -- ETHANOL BIODIESEL RENEWABLE DIESEL AND ROOM WITH NATURAL GAS. ALL OF THOSE TOGETHER VIA FEELS A CONTRIBUTED OVER 90% OF ALL THE L. CFS CREDITS PROGRAM TODAY. AND SINCE UP IN ALL CELLS CONSISTENTLY AT A DISCOUNT THE WHOLESALE GASOLINE WE ARE HELPING TO LOWER THE PRICE OF GASOLINE AT THE PUMP. I'M I I AGREE IF KATHY WHEN HE COST CONTAINMENT I AND I THINK ETHANOL IS IS ACTUALLY OF A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN IN ETHANOL'S PARTICIPATION. IS THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY TO INCREMENTAL FUEL SUPPLY LOW CARBON HIGH OCTANE FUEL BUT WE SELL CONSISTENTLY AT A OF FAIRLY -- MARKET DISCOUNT TO GASOLINE ARE ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO SEVENTY CENTS A GALLON LESS THAN THE PRICE OF WHOLESALE GASOLINE SO WE'RE DELIVERING ALL OF THESE WONDERFUL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AS A FUEL. ON BUT AT THE PUMP WERE ALSO LOWERING THE COST SO IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS ON TODAY LCF ASSN THE GASOLINE POOL. NO CAUSTIC SUMER MAYBE FIVE CENTS A GALLON NO SIX SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN IN THE LAST YEAR WE'RE ACTUALLY. IN THE COMMODITY PRICE FOR ETHANOL -- SAVING CLOSER TO A BILLION BUSH DOT. THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE FUELS AND HOW THAT INCREMENTAL SUPPLY IS ACTUALLY -- LOWERING THE COST TO CONSUMERS AT THE PUMP WHILE PROVIDING CHOICE. THE LCF* CREATED THE INCENTIVES NECESSARY TO DRIVE INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT IS RESULTED IN REDUCED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM ETHANOL PRODUCTION. CARP HAS CERTIFIED CARBON INTENSITIES FOR SOME PRODUCERS THAT ARE 4250% BELOW THE CARBON INTENSIVE GASOLINE AND THE MOST RECENT QUARTERLY DATA SHOWED. THE AVERAGE ETHANOL SEE AYE CARBON INDEX. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WAS 31% BELOW GASOLINE AND FALLING. IN FACT IT IS A MEASURE OF SUCCESS OF THE LCF ES AT SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM. THE AVERAGE CARBON INTENSITY ABOUT THEM ALL HAS BEEN REDUCED BY NEARLY 25% AND CONTINUES. TO CONTINUES TO FALL SO AGAIN THE PROGRAM HAS PROVIDE INCENTIVES OUGHT TO NOT ONLY BRING ON THE LOWER CARBON INTENSIVE FUELS BUT TO PROVIDE. INCENTIVES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TO FURTHER REDUCE THAT. S. CARD NOW CONSIDERS ADOPTION OF THE MORE AMBITIOUS LCF TARGETS OUT TWENTY THIRTY WE CONTINUE SUPPORT PROGRAM. INFRACTIONS IT WILL FACILITATE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE LONG TERM CI REDUCTION GOALS. THE PROGRAM -- ELECTED TO TO REALLY I SAY THAT THE AGO CAR BUT WE THINK HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB CARP STAFF HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY AND VERY PROFESSIONALLY ON COMING UP WITH THAT WITH THE PROGRAM -- THAT THAT DOES WORK IS UNDERSTANDABLE THEY'RE VERY APPROACHABLE ON IN THIS PROCESS TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF WORKSHOPS AND STAKEHOLDER MEETING SO. I DEATHLY WANT TO APPLAUD THEIR THEIR THIS PROGRAM AND AND TAKING ON THE THE CHALLENGES OF EXTENDING IT. WE FULLY UNDERSTAND CARDS COMMITMENT TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BUT IT'S CALIFORNIA PROGRESSES IN THAT DIRECTION ETHANOL AND OTHER BIOFUELS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER. DE CARBONIZED IN THE REMAINING USE OF LIQUID COMBUSTION FUELS. EVEN BY CARDS OWN PROJECTIONS IN TWENTY THIRTY THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW CAR SALES WILL BE POWERED BY THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. WITH THE RIGHT POLICY SIGNALS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF LIQUID FUELS WHILE PROVIDING. ZOOMER CHOICE AT REASONABLE FUEL COSTS. HIGHER ETHANOL BLENDS. LEVELS BEYOND TODAY'S NORM OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE LIQUID FUEL FOOL FUEL POOL WHILE REDUCING PETROLEUM CONSUMPTION. AND CONSUMER PRICES. ONE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT EVEN A MODEST INCREASE IN ETHANOL BLEND LEVELS COULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN MILLION. METRIC TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND THAT COMPARES TO THE THIRTY THREE MILLION METRIC TONS PROGRAM TODAY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. JUST WITH INCREMENTAL INCREASES AE TO GET TO A VERY SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS IN OUR EXISTING LIQUID FUEL. POOL. VIRTUE ALL THE CARS ON THE ROADS TODAY CAN RUN ON A 15% BLEND OF ETHANOL AND IN THE FUTURE NEW HIGHLY EFFICIENT. INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH OCTANE. LOW CARBON BENEFITS OF ETHANOL IN 2230% PLANTS. WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CARD ON HOW TO CREATE A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR OBLIGATED PARTIES TO HAVE THE OPTION. A PROVIDING HIGHER ETHANOL BLENDS TO FURTHER LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS FROM LIQUID FUELS AND GIVING CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS MORE FUEL CHOICES AT THE PUMP. SINCE ITS INCEPTION THE LCF ASPIN PROMOTED AS PERFORMANCE BASED STANDARD THAT IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. PICKING UP ON THAT POINT THAT THIS IS AT A CRITICAL POINT THAT WE MAINTAIN THAT -- IT IS IT'S BEEN A HALLMARK OF ITS SUCCESS AND HAS RESULTED IN A DIVERSIFICATION A FEW OPTIONS. IT'S CRITICAL THAT FUEL NEUTRALITY CONTINUES TO BE CENTRAL. TO THE LCF* AS THE PROGRAM IS FURTHER STRENGTHENED AND EXTENDED. TO TWENTY THIRTY HOW CALIFORNIA AFTER ALL INDUSTRY IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL. AND DAIRY INDUSTRIES TO CONVERT AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES AND DAIRY MANEUVER INTO THE PRODUCTION OF THE LOWEST CARBON BIOFUELS IN THE MARKET WE HAVE INITIATIVES TO CONNECT BY PIPELINE BIOGAS FROM DAIRIES DIRECTLY. YET INTO OUR ETHANOL PLANTS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DISPLACE THE NATURAL GAS ON BOTH SOLVING A AND METHANE ISSUE ON THE DAIRY AND OF THE THE ETHANOL THAT WERE PRODUCING. ALSO WORKING TO CONVERT AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES ON INTO -- INTO ETHANOL A AS WELL. WITH THE RIGHT CONSISTENT AND LONGER TERM MARKET SIGNALS ARE CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS. IN NEW LOW CARBON ETHANOL PRODUCTION IN THE STATE. FROM A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS PROVIDING GOOD PAYING JOBS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN PARTS OF OUR STATE. LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. VERY MUCH IN NEED OF NEW INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SALAS AND UP MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ARM. MY NAME IS JOKER XIN I'M THE FOUNDER OF ENCORE BY RENEWABLES I'VE BEEN IN THE OF BIODIESEL INDUSTRY IN THE BAO FEELS INDUSTRY FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS. I'M ALSO A CO FOUNDER AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BATTLEFIELDS ALLIANCE -- I ALSO CONSULT WITH CLEAN TECH COMPANIES AND DO BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION. I'M I'M GONNA FOCUS ON BIODIESEL TODAY IN THE AND MY DISCUSSION HERE -- SO THE AUSSIE OFFENSE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL ARE IN SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF BODIES ON CALIFORNIA BOTH IN IN USAGE AND IN A PRODUCTION. ARE HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA HAS LAGGED BEHIND THE REST OF THE WORLD OUT WHEN IT COMES TO OF BIODIESEL. BUT NOW IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING A LEADERSHIP POSITION -- THE LTFS FEEL NEUTRAL POLICY THAT OTHERS HAVE -- SPOKE ABOUT -- HAS ALLOWED BIODIESEL TO STAND ON ITS OWN MERITS -- AND AS A RESULT IT'S REALLY% GROWN UP DRAMATICALLY TODAY IT GENERATES ABOUT 20% OF ALL THE CREDITS HA IN THE SISKIN THE UP PROGRAM AND AS NEIL. POINTED OUT ABOUT FEELS IN GENERAL THERE ARE OVER 90% -- ALSO LOW CARBON FEEDSTOCKS SUCH AS USE COOKING ALL FROM RESTAURANT UP PRODUCTION ON ARE PURSUED NOW AND HISTORICALLY AT THE BEGINNING THEY WERE REALLY DISCOUNTED THEY WERE THERE WERE SEEN AS SOMETHING. WASTEFUL ANOTHER ACTUALLY MUCH MORE VALUABLE WHICH IS GREAT. A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD ATTRACTS LOW CARBON BIODIESEL FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD -- NOT JUST ALL. BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD -- THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF PRODUCTION IN THE STATE -- AND ALSO I WANT TO POINT OUT FROM AN EARLIER STATEMENT WILL LOW CARB FEEL STERN STANDARD HAS ALSO INSPIRED SIMILAR PROGRAMS ARE SUCH AS OREGON. WASHINGTON CANADA AND EVEN CHINA HOME SO THE WORLD IS REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE [inaudible] ON THE PROGRAM SUPPORTED THE GROWTH OF BIODIESEL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA -- QUITE DRAMATICALLY UP PRIMARILY -- HI THIS IS OUT MOST OF THE PLANTS IN THE STATE ARE PRODUCING FROM LOW CARBON FEEDSTOCKS. OTHER EIGHT PLANTS CURRENTLY OPERATING MORE ARE BEING BUILT AND MORE ARE BEING PLANNED -- EXPANSION PROJECTS TO HELP OUR HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL PLANTS BUT MANY ARE COMPLETED AND MANY MORE ARE UNDER WAY. UP PARTIALLY WITH HELP FROM THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. AND OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS ALL OF THIS DRIVEN BY THE LOW CARB FEELS THAT -- ALL BY A FEEL PLANTS THIS HAS. I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN ALL BATTLEFIELD PLANTS AND STATE HAVE BEEN BUILT AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHICH PROVIDE GOOD PAYING GREEN JOBS AND TRAINING THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS WHICH I THINK IS [inaudible] TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT. ON THE LOW CARB FEEL STANDARD HAS ENCOURAGED INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AND BODIES PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION FROM IN STATE FACILITIES. RESULTING REALLY IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR CALIFORNIA. UP MORE THAN A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIA BULK FUEL TERMINALS TODAY HAVE INVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND NOW SUPPORT BIODIESEL BLENDING AND THAT NUMBER IS GROWING -- RETAIL BLENDING TO BE TWENTY WHICH IS A 20% BLEND OF BIODIESEL IN WITH PETROLEUM DIESEL HAS GROWN EXTENSIVELY TO INCLUDE THE THREE MAJOR TRUCK STOP RETAILERS WHICH INCLUDE PILOT FLYING J.. TROUBLE CENTERS OF AMERICA PETROL PLAZA AND LOOKED -- LOW CARB A FEW STANDARD IS DRIVING TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN BIODIESEL AND OTHER RENEWABLE FUELS IN THIS STATE AND I THINK THAT'S I WON A PAUSE THERE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S FAR. TOO LARGE EXTENT. A DUE TO LOW CARB FEEL STANDARD AND AND ITS SUCCESS. CALIFORNIA'S LEADING AWAY IS LEADING THE WAY AS A RESULT -- WITH CLIMATE POLICIES ARMED WITH CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES HOT WHICH ARE PROVIDING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND THE JOBS THAT COME ALONG WITH THEM -- THIS ALL RESULTS IN HUGE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR THE STATE. FOR OUR WORKERS HERE -- THE ENERGY INDUSTRY IS ALREADY ADJUSTING IN MAKING REAL PROFITS AND AND THEY KNOW THIS -- I KNOW IT BECAUSE I TRADE WITH THEM EVERY DAY THEY ARE INVESTED IN YOU KNOW SEVERAL COMPANIES HAVE SAID -- ENDEAVOR IS ONE EXAMPLE WHERE AN ENERGY COMPANY WERE WERE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WERE FEET STUCK. TO SO THIS TRANSITION IS ALREADY UNDER WAY ON AND I WANT ALSO -- GIVE A REMINDER THAT -- JUST LIKE ETHANOL BIODIESEL SOLD AT A DISCOUNT TO DIESEL SO IT HELPS LOWER THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL IN MANY CASES UP TO ABOUT A DOLLAR. OR MORE A GALLON DISCOUNTED FROM THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL -- SO I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH. SAYING THE WORLD IS WATCHING YOU KNOW REALLY WATCHING CAREFULLY WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES. ALSO FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE WATCHING. WHAT THE STATE DOESN'T THERE'S TREMENDOUS SUPPORT I THINK IN THE STATE? FOR PROGRAMS ARE SUCH AS LUKEWARM FEEL STANDARD AND CAP AND TRADE WHICH ARE DIFFERENT CAP AND TRADE IT TALKS ABOUT PRODUCTION LIKE. FACTORIES THINGS LIKE THAT LOOK CORPORATE FEEL CENTERED STRICTLY FOCUSES ON TRANSPORTATION FUELS SO THAT THAT'S OF THE DIFFERENCE I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION EARLIER WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ARM. YOU KNOW OUR INDUSTRY BELIEVES THAT LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND EXTENDED TO TWENTY THIRTY AS PART BECAUSE PROPOSED THANKS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IT. JUST REAL QUICK BECAUSE YOU TOUCHED ON IS A 20% OF THE CREDITS OR GENERATED BY PILE FEELS. BIODIESEL BUT BIODIESEL OKAY AND OILFIELDS GENERATE OVER 90%. OVER 90% SAU MUCH. FOR NATURAL GAS AND ETHANOL THINK RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IS AROUND 10% NEED A LITTLE OVER. AND ETHEL'S CLOSE 250% DIESEL. RELIABLE DIESELS ABOUT 20% AS WELL 252025% GOT IT [inaudible] ALRIGHT. SO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TESTIMONY BUT LET ME. ASK A SPECIFIC QUESTION SO NOW THAT. WE HAVE EL CFS WE HAVE OUR TARGETS GOING TOWARDS TWENTY TWENTY AND POSSIBLY TWENTY THIRTY DEPENDING ON WHAT AIR BECOMES OUT WITH -- WE'RE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. AND EACH OF YOUR INDUSTRIES FACE AS WE REACH THE LE CARBON. INTENSITY. AT TARGETS COMING. WHAT WHAT'S THE BIGGEST? THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PREPARE FOR IF. IF THOSE WERE INCREASED THOSE TARGETS WERE INCREASES A TWENTY THIRTY I'LL START AND END LEASE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY OTHERS CAN CAN WEIGH IN BUT FIRST OF ALL. LET THIS IS A PRETTY ROSY PICTURE THAT WAS PAINTED -- I THINK WE JUST NEED TO REMIND OURSELVES WHY DID THE A RESOURCES BOARD REDUCE THEIR CARBON INTENSITY FROM 10% TWENTY TWENTY TWO SEVEN POINT FIVE AND TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT COST. RIGHT SO AGAIN THE COST ISSUE HERE IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAP AND TRADE IN LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. ONES ALLOT MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHER. WHY OUR BIO FUELS NOT ALLOWED TO ACCESS CAP AND TRADE REVENUES GOOD QUESTION. SO WHY ARE WE FOCUSING ON THE MOST THE LEAST COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM RATHER THAN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AS WE GO FORWARD -- AND IF WE'RE GONNA STAY WITH A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND I THINK ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THIS COMMITTEE COULD ASK US TO DO IS BRING YOU BACK. TEN BIG BOLD IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN REDUCE COST. AS ROSY AS THE PICTURE WAS PAINTED. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE THE PRICE OF A CREDIT FOR LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. PER TON VERSES. FIFTEEN SO WHY DO ECONOMISTS FROM HARVARD AND BERKELEY. SUPPORT CAP AND TRADE AND REALLY WONDER WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IT'S DUPLICATIVE IT DEPRESSES THE PRICE OF CAP TRADE. IT'S UNNECESSARY NOW WE'RE NOT. SAYING TO ABANDON LOW CARBON FUEL CENTER THOUGH I'D LOVE TO PROPOSE THAT. HOWEVER SINCE CALIFORNIA SEEMS TO BE WED TO IT LET'S AT LEAST. TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH THIS PROGRAM AS WE HAVE DONE WITH CAP AND TRADE BECAUSE WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON CAP AND TRADE. VERY AGGRESSIVE TARGETS WHICH WE SUPPORT BUT WITH A KEEN EYE ON PRICE CEILING SPEED BUMPS OFFSETS ALL OF THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES ON A REALLY EXPENSIVE AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM. AND AS YOU HEARD FROM THE LA OAK. THIS IS NOT THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. AND THE MARKET CLEARING PRICE MECHANISM IS NOT THE BEST SO. THERE'S LIKE I CONTINUE TO SAY THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT IF WERE GOING TO HAVE ALL OF THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS. MOVING TOGETHER TO MEET THESE GOALS THAT NOW APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO REMEMBER ASKING THE LA OF THE QUESTION OF DUPLICATIVE IN -- WHETHER SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHETHER IT'S A NEW LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. OR HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE REGULATIONS AS THEY ARE BE COMES OUT WITHIN -- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY DO COME OUT WITH THEM WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WE LOOK AT THE POLICIES MOVING FORWARD? WHAT IS COST EFFECTIVE WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR CONSUMERS AND CALIFORNIANS AND -- I'LL LET EVERYONE ANSWER BUT YOU KNOW I CAN LEADS TO THIS. TO MY SECOND QUESTION WHAT DOES WHEN WE TALKING ABOUT -- THE FLAMES TO OUT OF STATE BUSINESSES I WANTED UNDERSTAND OF THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE EVERYONE TALKED ABOUT THEIR IN STATE PRODUCTION. BUT IS THE ELSEVIER LCF ES PROGRAM GROWING IN STATE PRODUCTION ARE AS OPPOSED TO JUST. BRINGING IT IN FROM OUT OF STATE IN THAT WERE SELLING THOSE CRAP. BUT WE COULDN'T ADDRESS FIRST QUESTION FIRST YOU HAVE THAT ON THERE AND THE FIRST QUESTION I I DON'T THINK THERE IS IT. THAT IS DUPLICATIVE TO HAVE THE LC AT BASS AND AND CAP AND TRADE. BUT 40% OF ALL OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COME FROM TRANSPORTATION. TOLL IS ASINGLE LARGEST -- HHG IMPACTOR I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A PROGRAM IS VERY SPECIFIC [inaudible] TO TRANSPORTATION -- AND THAT IS WHAT THE L. CFS IS DOING CAP AND TRADE IS MORE GENERAL ECONOMY WHY I ALSO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT CATHY I DON'T THINK IT'S ARE. YOU COMPARE UNDER AND FIFTY DOLLAR -- LCF ASKREDDIT TO A FIFTEEN DOLLAR ONE IS AGAIN ECONOMY WIDE ACROSS TOUCHING A LOT MORE INDUSTRIES COLLECTING HOLESHOT MORE MONEY COSTING CONSUMERS A LOT MORE THAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PER GALLON IMPACT. ON ON ON THE CREDITS IN THE HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT'S A AN APPLE AND AN ORANGE AND BE OF VALUE WELL WE CAN LOOK AT IT FOR YOU KNOW. CENTS PER GALLON IF YOU PREFER BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY APPLES. TO AND A VERY VERY COMPETITIVE IN THAT REGARD THAT'S BEFORE YOU CONSIDER IN THE IN THE CASE OF ETHANOL BIODIESEL. AYE AND AND RENEWABLE MATCH GAPS THAT MATTER THAT THESE ARE LESS COSTLY A THEN THAT THE PATROLLING ALTERNATIVES SO IT'S THERE THERE'S A LOTS OF WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS AND LOTS OF WAYS. TO SLICE AND DICE THAT NET NANNIES TO BE DONE TOGETHER -- A FULL LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THE AND STATE THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION AT THE THE LCMS PROGRAM. IS ABSOLUTELY. CRITICAL AND OF THE AND BUILDING MORE BIOFUEL PRODUCTION IN THE STATE OF OUR COST OF DOING EVERYTHING ARE HIGHER THAN OUR COMPETITORS IN THE MIDWEST. OF THAT BECAUSE OF THAT THE POLICIES HERE ARE BEING CLOSE TO THIS MARKET HAVING VERY CLEAN SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY OPPORTUNITIES TO TO REALLY -- AKC COLLABORATE WITH THE DAIRY INDUSTRY A TO BRING IN THE BIO GAS YOU KNOW AND AND TO MONETIZE THAT THROUGH -- TO CARBON. CREDIT PRICING WHICH IS CARBON PRICING -- WE THAT WE HAVE A REAL INCENTIVE -- TO TO TO BRING AND AND LOTS OF NEW INVESTMENT AND GET THAT 15% TO YOU KNOW WAS I GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER WHO HAD A 40% GOAL. I BELIEVE BY TWENTY FORTY OR SO I FEEL PRODUCTION AND AND WE CAN GET THERE BUT WE NEED LONG TERM POLICIES THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT. THE EXTENSION OF THE LCF* TO TWENTY THIRTY A WE NEED A CERTAINTY ANTIC HOW THOSE MARKETS ARE GOING TO PERFORM. ARM AND ALSO IN THE CASE OF OF ETHANOL A WE NEED ACCESS TO MORE THE GASOLINE TANK AGAIN ACCESS OPTIONS FOR THE REFINERS TO BLEND MORE THAN. 10% ETHANOL SO WE CAN FURTHER REDUCE THE COST OF GASOLINE AS WELL AS FURTHER REDUCE CARBON INTENSITY SUDDENLY JUST CLARIFY SO HE SAID 15% OF OF THE IN STATE COMES FROM ETHANOL BUT THE ENGINES. FOR A CAR. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TAKING 10% LANGUAGE SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY GO UP 215% THEY CAN VIRTUALLY I'M SO THAT THE EPA HAS CERTIFIED THAT -- THAT ALL CARS MODEL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND NEWER A CAN RUN ON MAJORITY OF THE OF THE CARS ON THE ON THE ROAD TODAY SO YES --% VIRTUALLY ALL THE CARS IN CALIFORNIA CAN RUN ON A 15% PLAN WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS JUST A AN OPTION FOR REFINERS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THAT. I THAT FUEL AYE TO THE A TO THE CONSUMERS -- AND LET THEM LET THEM CHOOSE AND WE AND WE FEEL THAT THAT'S A VERY VALUABLE TOOL IN THEY ELSE IT HAS TO BOXES TO US. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO TO WILL HAVE THE HIGHER PLANS TO REDUCE CARBON INTENSITY. THAT ALONE EVERYBODY ANSWER WILL COME BACK. TO YOU CAN FOR COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS -- DO YOU BACKING ON WHAT NEIL SAID I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FROM OUR ORGANIZATIONS PERSPECTIVE -- IS REALLY MARKET CERTAINTY SO WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO OBTAIN FINANCING BASED ON A TRADABLE CREDIT THAT HAS HUGE FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICE -- DUE TO WHATEVER THE NEWS STORY WAS THAT WHATEVER CAR MAY HAVE SAID IN A WORKSHOP AND PRICES GO UP AND DOWN AND IT'SVERY HARD TO OBTAIN FINANCING MARKETS ARE INDEED HUGE FOR US -- PURSUANT TO SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE WAS A PROPOSAL TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE FINANCING MECHANISM THAT WOULD BE -- RUN SOMEHOW THROUGH THE STATE -- SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE SOME KIND OF A PUT OPTION AT OUR STATE COULD BECOME SOME KIND OF A BUYER OF LAST RESORT SOMETHING THAT WOULD. CREATE ADDITIONAL CERTAINTY FOR THE MARKET SO THAT WE CAN GO OUT AND AND OBTAIN CAPITAL AND SO THAT WOULD BE AND MY TAKE ON WHAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE SHOULD BE IN IN REALLY SCALING UP AND TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE AND ENHANCE TARGET. ON THE IN STATE VERSUS OUT OF STATE CONVERSATION SO OUR ENERGY IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY. WE HAD SOME VERY ONEROUS PIPELINE INJECTIONS STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ESSENTIALLY MADE IT COST PROHIBITIVE TO INJECT IN STATE AND SO THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WAS DEVELOPED OUT OF STATE. FOR CALIFORNIA MARKET ALMOST ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY THE LCF S. -- STACKED ON TOP OF THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD -- THAT'S CHANGING AT JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THAT CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RELEASED A STUDY THAT HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE CAN LOWER THE STANDARDS -- TO ENABLE ON IN STATE MARKET. I WILL SAY THAT THE CURRENT RULES OF THE LC FS AND THE WAY THAT THE CARBON INTENSITY CALCULATION IS MEASURED. THE USE OF SOMETHING THAT IS CALLED THE GREEK MODEL AND THAT'S DONE BY THE FEDERAL ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY. AND IT'S VERY THOROUGH IT'S IT DOES CREATE AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR CARBON INTENSITY FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND AND SO BY DEFINITION THAT MODEL WILL GIVE A LEG UP TO AN IN STATE PROJECT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TRANSPORT FUEL FURTHER IF IT'S OUT OF STATE. AND YOU GET DEEMED ON YOUR CARBON INTENSITY I THINK UNFORTUNATELY TO DATE THAT DIFFERENCE HAVE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH. TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE PROJECTS AND SO YOU'LL SEE IS. MONEY THAT'S BEING COMING DOWN THROUGH CAP AND TRADE FOR EXAMPLE FOR DAIRY GUY JESTERS -- OR ORGANICS RECYCLING FACILITIES THAT KIND OF CAN HELP BALANCE THAT OUT AND BUT I DID WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THAT THE MODEL THAT IS USED BY CARD ACTUALLY DOES GIVE -- INCENTIVE TO PRODUCE AND STAYED THAT WAY THAT IS DESIGNED. BALLOT TACKLING O. TO STOCK IT WITH MUCH OF THE LEGISLATORS WE OUT FOR MORE AND STATE THAT'S AS OPPOSED. TO YOU KNOW IN THAT YEAR EITHER DOLLARS JUST AND WE ARE AND THAT'S OUT OF STATE YEAH. THAT'S WHY REFERENCE THE HELL IT WAS REALLY THAT CARP ASSESSMENT THAT I REFERENCE THAT LOOKS THAT. TWO THIRDS OF THE COST OF COMPLIANCE FLOWS OUT OF THE STATE BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY THIRTY WHEN THAT IS A CARB ASSESSMENT SO I DO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO REALLY LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME LIKE IT STAYS IN THE STATE. BUT THERE'S THERE'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH IN THE BIODIESEL INDUSTRY IN PRODUCTION IN THE STATE AND SEVERAL EXPANSION PROJECTS SEVERAL PLANTS -- HAVE DONE MORE THAN ONE EXPANSION PROJECT SO IT'S DEFINITELY GROWING OUR CAPACITY IS GROWING THERE'S PLANTS ARE BEING BUILT TODAY. PEERS PLANTS THAT ARE BEING PLANNED TODAY SO ARM AND THAT'S DRIVEN BY SOME CERTAINTY THAT'S CREATED BY LAMAR FEEL CENTER LOTS OF INVESTMENT -- THERE'S A PLAN THAT WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE ITS OWNERSHIP AND COMPANY FROM OUT OF STATE CAME INTO CALIFORNIA AND PURCHASE THAT PLANT. AND IS BUILDING IT AND PLANNING TO EXPAND IT SO WELL AND THAT'S DRIVEN BY THE LOW CARB FEEL STANDARD AND YET THEY STARTED OUT BRINGING FUEL IN. BUT THEN THEY SAID HEY THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM WE WANT. TO A PART OF IT THERE'S A THERE'S OPPORTUNITY. CREATE MORE JOBS ARE GOING TO CREATE MORE REVENUE MORE TAX REVENUE -- I MIGHT POINT OUT AND I THINK OTHERS MIGHT AGREE THAT. ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS THE SEQUEL LAW IN CALIFORNIA IN GETTING PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND WE UNDERSTAND THAT -- ASSEMBLY ARE FRUSTRATED FITS IT TAKES TWELVE YEARS TO BUILD A SUPER WALMART. WELL YOU KNOW IT'S IT WERE SUBJECT TO THAT AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A HARM A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT COME THERE ARE SO MANY PLANTS BEING BUILT IN HAVE BEEN BUILT AN ARM. PLAN TO BE BUILT. THAT THEY THEY CAN OVERCOME THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF INCENTIVE IT'S CREATED BY LOW CARB FEEL STANDARD CUT. LET ME ASK YOU A GENERAL QUESTION -- FOR THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD DOES IT MATTER WHICH YOUR FEEDSTOCK IS SO YOU KNOW EARLIER IN TESTIMONY ADVENTURE AND YOU KNOW A COOKING GREASE FOR INSTANCE AND COMPARE THAT TO MAYBE ANIMAL FAT OR ANY OF THE OTHER. STOCK FEELS HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE MAKE UP OF THE FUEL AND WHAT IT CAN BE USED [inaudible] FOR WELL. WEEKLY THERE'S WAYS OF PROCESSING THOSE DIFFERENT FEEDSTOCKS AND THE PLANTS. THAT PROCESS THOSE -- FEEDSTOCK. OFTEN CALLED INTO BIODIESEL WORLD. A MULTI FEEDSTOCK PLAN AND THEY KNOW HOW TO PROCESS THEM ARE AND AND BRING THEM TO MARKET. SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM IS DATE CARBON INTENSITY AS DEFINED BY THE GREEK MODEL -- AND SO -- MOST OF THE PLANTS IN THE STATE USING USED COOKING ALL THEIR SEE I NUMBER THEIR CARBON INTENSITY NUMBER -- WHICH IS THE OFFSET TO THAT ROUGHLY -- HUNDRED A NUMBER THAT YOU SEE FOR FOR PETROLEUM DIESEL FUEL. HARPER. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SO THAT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN 80% 85% REDUCTION AND THAT'S MOST THE PLANTS IN THE STATE. ARM SOME OF THEM USE OUR ANIMAL FATS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY MORE LIKE -- THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE SOME USE QUORUM WITCHER THIRTY THE I MEAN SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF OF CAR C. EYES FOR THE DIFFERENT. OF FEEDSTOCKS. BUT AS FAR AS WHAT CAN BE USED FOR WHAT PURPOSE TYPICALLY THEY CAN ALL BE PROCESSED SO THAT THEIR THEY CAN BE BLENDED WITH HARM WITH THESE. CUT IT WOULD YOU NEED HIGHER PERCENTAGES MAYBE I GUESS FOR EVERYBODY WOULD YOU NEED A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THAT PLAN TO EQUAL THE SAME AMOUNT OF AN OF THE MEGA JOULES LIKE ASSEMBLY HAD PENSION EARLY ON FROM MEMBER FIZZY. LA OVER SOMEONE ON THIS PANEL. AB BECAUSE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE QUESTION I GET A LOT BACK HOME IS YOU KNOW HE WON A MOVE TO THESE RENEWABLE STANDARDS AND BUT THE QUESTION I GET FROM MY FRIENDS INSIDE THE TRUCK DRIVERS BACK ON PEOPLE THAT OWN TRUCKING FLEET. IS THERE ASKING OKAY WHERE YOU ONCE TO BLAND ACTS AMOUNT AND IN THE FUTURE YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA ASK FOR MORE. BUT AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT START AFFECTING MY EFFICIENCY OF MY ENGINES. AND IS GOING TO COST ME MORE IN TERMS OF FILLING UP MORE. AS OPPOSED TO USING A BASE DIESEL SO WITH BIODIESEL THERE'S A VERY SLIGHT INCREMENTAL LA DECREASE IT'S ABOUT. 324% AND ON AND THAT AND ON A 20% BLEND. IT'S I WOULD SAY DE MINIMUS AND MORE HAS TO DO WITH HOW HEAVY THE FOOT OF THE DRIVER IS AND THEN THE ENERGY VALUE IN THE FUEL -- BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU [inaudible] NUMEROUS STOPPED NOW THAT SAY. A B. TWENTY BODIES MAY CONTAIN UP 220% BODIES ALSO MORE AND MORE TRUCK STOPS ARE DOING THAT'S WHY BECAUSE THERE'S VALUE IN IT FOR THEM. COM AND AND IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT ENTRY SO MORE MORE TRUCK DRIVERS. ART ARE UTILIZING IT MORE OF THE OEMS THE TRUCK MANUFACTURERS ARE ALLOWING HIGHER BLENDS NOW BIODIESEL IN FACT MOST OF THE HEAVY DUTY OEMS ALLOW 20% PLANNED. SO IT THIS IS SORT OF HAPPENING BE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THIS I REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO TRY TO MARKET TO FLEETS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE FARMS LEADS. DIDN'T WANNA USE BY IDEAS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO USE 5% OR EVEN 2% THEY WERE SCARED OF IT THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD. YOU KNOW THEIR HEADLIGHTS WOULD GO OUT AND ALL MANNER OF THINGS WOULD HAPPEN. EXCEPT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACT COMMUNITIES IN THE MIDWEST WHERE THEY GROW SOYBEANS THEY ADOPTED OF MUCH QUICKER BECAUSE THEY WERE GROWING THE FEED STOCKS AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY FROM IT. AND LO AND BEHOLD IT NO LONGER BECAME THREATENING WHEN THEY REALIZE WHAT WE ACTUAR MAKING MONEY OFF THIS. THERE ARE PROGRAMS UP HERE IN THE STATE TO TRY TO DEVELOP IN STATE FEET STOCKS AS WELL PURPOSE GROWN ENERGY CROPS -- A STEVE KAFKA WITH A UC DAVIS HE RUNS THE BIO ENERGY -- UP PROGRAM THERE AND HE'S DONE SOME TREMENDOUS WORK IN AND DEVELOPING IN STATE PURPOSE GROUND FEEDSTOCK FROM BATTLEFIELDS [inaudible] CUT NO. WITH WITH THAT I I THINK. BUT ONE I WANT TO KNOW HOW THE PROJECT IN MY DISTRICT GOING WITH THE DAIRY -- MOVING OVER BECAUSE ARCHIE GUYS USING SOME OF THE AND WASTE FROM THE DAIRY LEGUMES INTO BILE DIESEL ISN'T THAT PART OF WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING. THAT SO THAT IS PART OF THE PROJECT IS A VERY INTEGRATED PROJECT IT'S ELEVEN DAIRIES THAT -- WERE DIE GESTURES ARE BEING PUT IT INSTALLED ON THOSE AREAS AND THEN A PIPELINE INTO -- INTO THE PLANT IN PIXLEY AND IT WILL GO -- ONE OF THREE WAYS MIDDLE IT'LL BE A FUEL SOURCE OF FOR PRODUCING THE ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL PLANT THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOW BUILDING THERE AS WELL -- AND THERE ALSO [inaudible] A GAS IMPRESSING STATIONS SO DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMICS AND THE DIVERSIFICATION AND WHAT THE THE MARKETS ARE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IT'LL EITHER GOING TO THE PRODUCTION OF BIODIESEL -- INTO -- ETHANOL OR RENEW PANACHE GAS OF REALLY SHOWING HOW ALL THREE OF THESE THINGS ACTUALLY CAN CO EXIST ON THE ON THE SAME LEADERS RUN AWAY WHERE WORD DAIRY IS ABLE. TO SELL THE WAYS. IN IN MEET THEIR STANDARD MATH II STANDARDS YEAH. WHO SO SO THEY'RE PROTECTED ON THE DAIRY JI YES YOUR SIDE? WHICH SOLVE THAT ISSUE FOR DAIRY WHICH IS HUGE HUGE AND THEN CREATING BIODIESEL. CHILDREN LOWER THE COST OF DIESEL FOR EVERYBODY. AND OUR FINAL HEADED LOWER THAN ASSN ALL AND CAPTURING NATURAL NATURAL GAS RIGHT. AND THEN -- WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IN THE SO WHY HASN'T CALIFORNIA. PAVE THE WAY FOR SEQUEL REFORM FOR YOU GUYS YEAH IF IT GOOD QUESTION BUT THE THE OTHER DAY COMPLETE THAT LIVE BECAUSE THIS PROJECT IS SUCH AN AMAZING PROJECT -- IT'S WHEN WE CONVERT THE STARCH IN THE CORN TO ETHANOL. ALL OF DAY THE REAL FEED VALUE IS CONCENTRATE IN WHAT WE CALL DISTILLERS GRAINS -- AND THAT GOES BACK TO THE DAIRIES. TO TO FEED THE ANIMALS. TO THEN PRODUCE. HASN'T THERE BYPRODUCT MILLER MANEUVER THAT COMES BACK TO US TO POWER THE PROCESS OF THEIRS IS REALLY PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE IS BEING CREATED WHICH THE ECONOMICS OF THAT OUTSTANDING IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THAT IS. IT'S QUITE EXEMPLARY GOT IT. YEAH I'M JUST MAKING SURE THEY GET THE CREDITS FOR NONE OF LEADER CAUCUS WILL HELP WITH THAT. LIBYA FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION I WAS ASKING DIESEL BUT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE. THREE SPOILED DEFERRED GASOLINE -- VIDEO AND IT'S MIXED BECAUSE THERE YOU GO TO CERTAIN GAS STATIONS AND IT'S MIXED WITH ETHANOL FOR INSTANCE TO ADD TO LOWER THE CARBON INTENSITY BUT DOES THAT FUEL STILL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY. BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING ABOUT COULD HEAR ABOUT IT FROM THE TRUCKERS [inaudible] NON OF REGULAR GAS POWERED VEHICLES NOT I AND I I THINK WHAT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT AS YOU KNOW. WE OBVIOUSLY PLANNED UP 210% ETHANOL CURRENTLY. BEFORE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE COULD BURN I MEAN WE COULD BLEND UP 10% ETHANOL IT'S AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S THE TYPE. OF ETHANOL IN THE CARBON INTENSITY THAT BECOMES THE IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT. OF THAT DISCUSSION AND EVEN AS WE PHAM AS WHEN WE WILL ALWAYS COMPLY WITH THIS RIGHT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE COMPLY. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT. COMPLIANCE WON'T INCREASE COSTS TO THE THE TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE THE TWO GROUPS THAT HAVE. CONTINUED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WITCHES ECONOMISTS. WHO CARE ABOUT COST? AND CONSUMERS WHO CARE ABOUT COST. SO AGAIN AS WE BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE AS REFINERS CONTINUE TO MEET THE OBLIGATION. OF CARBON INTENSITY AT THAT 10% -- AT THE 10% LEVEL -- IT BECOMES IT IT'S AN INTERESTING PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU. BLEND INTO OUR FUEL TO MEET YOUR COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT YOUR BEST AVENUE UNTIL NOTHING'S AVAILABLE TO MEET THOSE CI TARGETS AND WERE ONLY AT THREE POINT 5%. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE OR YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE CARBON INTENSITIES IS YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE CREDIT MARKET TO COMPLY. WHICH WE WILL. THEREFORE THE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS KICK SAND IN ALL THOSE COST COMPONENT STARTED. SO ARE YOU SAYING RIGHT NOW THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MEET THE LCF. AS BY BLENDING WELL I DON'T HAVE THE LOWER AT THE LOWER SEE AT THE LOWER PERCENTAGES RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT LOW. PERCENTAGES RIGHT NOW IN THE CARBON INTENSITY THREE POINT 5% NOT 10% NOT 18% RIGHT SO WHERE THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE PROGRAM. SO YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IN THE EARLY STAGES YOU WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP CREDITS BECAUSE YOU WERE ABLE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS AS THESE AS THESE PERCENTAGES INCREASE WHICH THEY WILL AS WE KNOW GETS THE BIKE PATH. THEN THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE BEST FOR THE CRUNCH STARTS COMING IN. FROM FROM WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND THE COST. GOTTEN SO READ OUR THEORY AND THIS IS I THINK YOU REFERRED TO IT EARLIER THAT. AIR BE REDUCED. THE GOAL FOR TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT FROM THE THREE POINT FIVE NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO SOME POINT FIVE AS OPPOSED 210% AND IT'S IT'S BACK LOADING AGAIN RIGHT. IF IF I GATHERED THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE YOU KNOW THE TARGETS ARE AMBITIOUS AND THAT'S WHY -- YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE IT WAS THE MEMBER COMPANIES IN. AND OTHER -- LIQUID FUEL PROVIDERS YOU KNOW THAT IS THE THE MOST DOMINANT FUEL AND WILL BE FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND WHAT WE DO TO CONTINUE -- TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND DRIVE DOWN THE CARBON INTENSITY OF LIQUID FUELS AT AFFORDABLE COST AND THAT'S WHERE WE THINK THAT THE OPTION TO DUBLIN MORE BY FEELS. ON THE IS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE TODAY AND IT'S FALLING BUT OUR ETHANOL ON AVERAGE. IT'S 30% LASSEN GHASTLY SO THEORETICALLY IF OF THE LIQUID FUEL IS A HUNDRED SAN GASOLINE A CARPET GO 230% REDUCTION. WE'D BE THERE AND WITH WITH ETHANOL THE LOWER PRICING GHASTLY WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. TO TO GRADUALLY INCREASE THE PLANS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE FUEL PROPERTIES OF ETHANOL NOT ONLY CARBON INTENSITY BUT AKANE SO TO IN RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION. ON IS THE THE ENERGY DOES HAVE PER UNIT BALLING VERY GOOD. ASPECT OF GASOLINE IS IT'S IT'S VERY DANCE ENERGY -- ETHANOL'S ENERGY DENSITY PER UNIT VOLUME PER GALLON IS ABOUT OCTANE IS A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN SO IF YOU OPTIMIZE AROUND THE OCTANE OF ETHANOL. WHICH IS WHAT THE THE NEW GENERATION OF ENGINES WILL DO OUGHT TO RUN ON HIGHER OCTANE FUELS YOU YOU TAKE THAT THAT LOSS OF ENERGY DENSITY. AND YOU MORE THAN GAIN IT BACK THROUGH HIGHER PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF THE OCTANE SO THAT'S THAT THE OPPORTUNITY AND WHY HIGHER BLENDS ARE REALLY A SWEET SPOT KNOWN ONLY FROM. A AYE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE BUT FROM A HIGH PERFORMANCE OF OF AN ENGINE WHERE YOU CAN MORE THAN OFFSET. THE AT THE END RIGHT ANY CAR EARLY FAMILIES ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MILES PER GALLON VERSES -- OCTANE WILL A BUT THAT'S THE POINT IS I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU IF YOU HAVE AN ENGINE THAT -- RUNS ON A HIGHER OCTANE FUEL YOU GET MORE MILES PER GALLON SO YOU CAN TAKE A HIGHER LEVEL OF ABSENT WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WENT THERE TO THE MILE YEAH GALA MILES PER GALLON. AND OCTANE ROSBERG ALLEN IS WHAT COUNTS YEAH EVERYBODY'S GOING OKAY THE THE COST IS GOING UP BUT IF I CAN'T DRIVE AS FAR THEN. WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MATTER WILL NOT SEE IT REYES OF RECALL YOU'LL GOING UP A LITTLE BIT BUT I CAN DRIVE FARTHER? THEN THERE'S A BALANCE. THOSE ARE ANY ENGINES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED WITH THE HIGHER OCTANE. BUT THERE ARE A ENGINES AND DEVELOPMENT THERE ARE -- CARS IT'S A MUCH USE PREMIUM SO -- TURBOCHARGING IS IS WHICH MOST NEW CARS HAVE IS ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT -- THAT OCTANE -- YOU CAN THERE'S ABOUT AND OVER A MILLION CARS IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN RUN 85% ETHANOL. AND YOU CAN BUY THAT FUEL ATTA SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER GALLON LISTEN GASOLINE TODAY RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO [inaudible] OKAY. I HAVE A LIST OF MORE QUESTIONS WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL. LET ME JUST ASK THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. JUST AND AS THESE THINGS DEVELOP ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TWENTY OH SPECIAL YOU TILL -- AS AS THINGS GO FOR ESPECIALLY AS WE GET INTO LOOKING AT LEGISLATION FOR NEXT CYCLE. ON WAYS THAT -- WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO COME TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE THINGS AND DEAL WITH SOME OF THE STUFF IN. HOPEFULLY MOVE THE BALL ON SOME III OUR SECRET STUFF IS A WHILE -- MY FEELING IS IF AS A ST WERE GOING TO AYE BASICALLY MANDATE THIS WE NEED. TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER IS A STATE TO EXPEDITE IT MAKE IT COST. FROM THE FOR OUR PEOPLE. CORRECT YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEAR ABOUT BACK IN OUR DISTRICTS AS A COST CONTAINMENT AND WHAT ELSE MAINLY MEANS TO EACH CONSUMER AS AS A DRIVING THEIR VEHICLES AND YOU KNOW THERE'S POLICIES THAT THAT HAVE BEEN PUSH FORWARD AND AND THE STATE TO START MOVING TOWARDS NEAR. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BUT NO I THINK WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM BEING THERE -- UNDER PERCENT SPACE AUTHORED A BAND OF CALIFORNIANS AND MEETING IN STATE PRODUCTION. AS WE DO THAT AND SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THIS WHAT IS THE COST CONTAINMENT. I FOR THAT AS AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. AND ADD THE TIMELINE FOR THAT THE WHICH IS WHY WE WANTED TO HAVE THIS HEARING EARLY ON BEFORE WE SEE WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE FROM MAYOR BE IN YOU KNOW MOST LIKELY WILL PROBABLY HAVE A FOLLOW UP HEARING. AS SOON AS THEY ARE BE HAS REGULATIONS AND JUST SEE. HOW IT FITS INTO THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE ANOTHER PROGRAM THERE'S CAP AND TRADE THAT'S OUT THERE THAT THIS BODY PASSED LAST YEAR? FATHER'S PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WHERE THEY GO ALL THE WAY. TO TWO OR THREE EIGHTY SEVEN AND ALL THE OTHER HOST OF OTHER -- PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT A PASSED. BUT I KNOW -- ONE THING THAT I HEAR ABOUT FROM CONSUMERS BACK HOME AND ALSO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUE SAYS IN ULTIMATELY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO THE CONSUMER AND WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT IS THIS HAVING. NOT ONLY ON GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BUT WHAT IS IT DOING FOR FOR FOLKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY GROW JOBS IN THE STATE AS COMPARED TO OUR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS IT'S ADVISING THINGS HAPPENING OUT OF STATE. WHICH THEN -- YEAH TAXPAYERS AND HAVE LITTLE GRIEF OVER. UP BUT THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY APPRECIATE THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS OUR I THE FIRST STEP IN MANY STEPS AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS WHAT'S COMING OUT -- FROM THE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND AS WE CONTINUE MOVE FORWARD AND TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO CONSIDER WHAT THAT RIGHT ENERGY MAKES IS TO DO ALL THREE THINGS THE ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMY AND SOCIAL QUALITY AS WELL SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. OUR SOULS GO TO MOVE TO THE THIRD PANEL. WE HAVE -- DAVID HACKETT WITH STILLWATER ASSOCIATES CAN'T -- LEACOCK WITH PER TERRA. AND GEORGE WARRANTY WITH SAN JOAQUIN RANCHER REGIONAL TRANSIT I BELIEVE -- MISTER HANKEY YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITH [inaudible] CORRECT [inaudible] FOR OKAY. SO FLEW COULD MOVE THROUGH THIS AND THE OFFICIAL TWITTER WITH OUR COMMENTS. WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN? GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ALISON COMMITTEE -- MINING STATE HACKETT I'M THE PRESIDENT STILL WATER ASSOCIATES. WE'RE A TRANSPORTATION ENERGY CONSULTING COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN IRVINE. NOW TO SAY THAT HIGH VISIT THE BEEN CALIFORNIAN FOR A LONG TIME THIS THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAPITAL. SO IT'S KIND OF COOL. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME VISIT YOUR HOUSE OUR HOUSE AT A GALA AT NICK'S FREMONT PEOPLE'S HOUSE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- THAT WE'VE WE'VE PAID ATTENTION TO THE LCF ES SINCE THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED IT -- THINK I PROBABLY SAW NEIL WHEN HE WAS ON THE STAGE. WITH THE GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER WHO THAT HAPPENED -- AND SO -- WE PAY ATTENTION TO IT WE PUBLISH A NEWSLETTER LOW CARB FEEL STANDARD. AND AS WELL I'M A MEMBER OF OF WHAT WAS THINK CALIFORNIANS YOU COMMISSIONS PATROLLING MARKET VISOR COMMITTEE. SO -- Y.. AMONG THE PRACTICE AREAS OUR ENERGY POLICY. AND THROUGH A LOT OF CLIENTS IN THE SPACE SORT OF ALL OVER THE SPECTRUM. AND AND REALLY WE HAVE A DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OF THE ISSUES. BUT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE -- BUT AS HEARD MOST PEOPLE YOU KNOW REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REGULATION -- AND TODAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS -- SOME SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES TO DATE. THE COST TO CONSUMERS OF THE PROGRAM AND AND I I DON'T KNOW THAT WEEPS REALLY ANYBODY ELSE'S TALKED ABOUT THAT. IF YOU HAVE A LOT. IN THE SUN IN THE FUTURE PROGRAM. SO ONCE WE'RE DONE YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROGRAM'S TODAY AND WHERE IT'S HEADED -- GLITZY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION. AT YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL FEELS GENERATE CREDITS AND AND WITHDRAWING FUELS [inaudible] GENERATE DEFICITS. AND ALL ABSTRACT BY CAR. HERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHART NOW WHAT YOU HAVE IS IN BLACK AND WHITE. NC INSERT BECOMES A REAL LIFE TEST -- BUT IF THIS CHART A GIVES YOU SUCH. AN APPRECIATION FOR HOW THE AVENUE WILL FEEL STACKED UP PRO MUCH THEY CONTRIBUTE. TO LET'S TALK ABOUT CREDITS. SO THE RED ONES ARE VARIOUS KINDS OF ETHANOL. AND THE BLUE ONES [inaudible] OUR BIODIESEL AND RENEWABLE DIESEL. AND THEN WHAT YOU SEE. WITH THE GREEN STRIPE HERE IS REALLY KIND OF THE GROWTH OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS SAID. IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA WHAT THESE PERCENTAGES ARE. AND THEN FROM THERE IT'S IT'S THE ELECTRICITY ON ROAD OFF FROM THE ROAD. ELECTRICITY PRIMARILY. BUT AND SO YOU ASKED A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HOW MUCH IS BLUE HOW MUCH THESE CREDITS ARE CAUSED BY COME FROM BLENDING AND HOW MUCH ARE PURCHASED. RIGHT SO THE REFINERS AND IMPORTERS. ARE BLENDING WITH A RED ETHANOL. BLUE BIODIESEL RENEWABLE DIESEL. AND THEY'RE BUYING FROM THE CREDIT PRODUCERS. OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS ELECTRICITY THE REST OF OKAY -- MOVE ON TO PRICES. SO A ALEJO CHAU CHIU -- THAT CREDIT PRICES. IN DOLLARS PER METRIC TON. AND THAT'S THE BIG BLUE LINE AND THE Y. AXIS LABELS SHOWS YOU THE DOLLARS PER TON. THE A OTHER LINES -- OTHER WINDS ARE FOR GASOLINE AND DIESEL. AND THEIR PRICES ARE ON THE RIGHT HAND Y. AXIS. AND SO WHAT THIS SHOWS ESSENTIALLY IS THAT. AS OF LAST WEEK THE COST FOR CONSUMERS. FOR ELSE -- FOR GASOLINE WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN CENTS AND FOUR DIESEL WAS A BIT MORE THAN. EIGHT AND AT AN AS YOU DISCUSS THE MAJORITY OF THE OF THE REVENUE FOR THESE CREDITS. OF FLOWS OUT OF STATE I THINK CARD SAID 13%. KNEELS NUMBER WAS 15%. BUT IT'S IT'S A BIT OF THE VAST MAJORITY BUT IN A DOESN'T STAY HERE BECAUSE OUT OF STATE OKAY SO WHERE'S THE PROGRAM NOW AND AND HOW TO GET HERE. WELL WE TALKED ABOUT. CARBON TNC REDUCTION HAS REACHED THREE AND A HALF PERCENT REACH THREE AND A HALF PERCENT IN. SEVENTEEN WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO BE FURTHER ALONG THAN THAT. BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT -- LAWSUITS. CURRENT HELD THE REDUCTION LEVEL CONSTANT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE PROGRAM. SO HERE WE ARE [inaudible] FOR SEVEN YEARS OR SO REALLY INTO THE PROGRAM WE GOT THREE AND A HALF CENT. AND AS KATHY SAID. TRINITY EASY THREE AND HALF HOURS. IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGHER FROM HERE. AND LET THESE OTHER STRIPED BARS REPRESENT. WHAT -- THEY ARE BE IS -- HAD HIS. NO RECOMMEND THEIR PROPOSAL TO GET TO A 20% REDUCTION BY. TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S HOW MUCH REDUCTION THERE IS TO GO FROM HERE. SO THEN THE LEGISLATIVE ARE ANALYST'S OFFICE TALKED ABOUT CREDITS AND DEFICITS IN THE COULD TALK ABOUT A BANK. HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT BANK WHERE THE BAR CHARTS IN THE MIDDLE THERE THOSE SIR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CREDITS AND DEFICITS THEY WERE GENERATED ON THE CORALIE BASIS. AND THEN THE REDLINE IT'S ACCUMULATED AMOUNT YOU CAN SEE THAT. BUT THAT BOTTOM THAT BANK GOT TO BE ABOUT TEN MILLION CREDITS. AND SEVENTEEN BUT BUT SOME OF CREDITS AND DEFICIT WAS ABOUT FLAT SO THAT THE BANK DIDN'T BUILD ALL. HERE IN SEVENTEEN AND I WOULD SAY WE WERE SORT OF SURPRISED BY THAT WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE A BILL TO THE BANK. THE BANKS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES. A IT PROVIDES LIQUIDITY. FOR THE FOR THE TRADING SYSTEM BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU KNOW THAT OF ANY OTHER KIND OF A BANK IF IF THAT THERE'S MONEY AS A CASH IN THE AND THE AND THE BANKER BUT HE'S HAPPY AND THINGS FLOW BACK AND FORTH. AND WHAT WE THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE THINK ABOUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE PRICES WILL RESUME BACK TO PRICE REAL QUICK HERE SEE. A PRETTY DRAMATIC MOVEMENT PRICES -- THIS YEAR AND I THINK WE THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY RECOGNITION BY THE MARKETPLACE [inaudible] THAT -- THAT THE THAT THE BANKS DONE BUILDING. AND IS LIKELY TO START DRAWING THAT IS TO SAY THAT THERE BE A SUPPLY DEMAND IMBALANCE THAT BE MORE DEFICITS CREATED THING CREDITS. NOW AS I DO JUST BECAUSE IN OUR MOVING FROM THAT THREE AND A HALF PERCENT THE EASY. THE EASY PART NOW GET HERE OR DIDN'T PARTY NEEDS YOU CAN ONLY GO BACK UP AGAIN YOU CAN SEE HOW THESE. THE DEFICITS SORT OF WORK ROUGHLY CONSTANT WHILE THE LAWSUITS ARE GOING ON AT ONCE THAT WAS SETTLED. THEN. THE REQUIREMENT RATCHETED DOWN STEPPED FOR SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN AND THEN A STEP. FOR SEVENTEEN SO YOU CAN SEE THOSE STEPS IN AN AND NUMBER BEAUTIFUL PLACES. SO NOW THE CONSUMER COSTS ARE STARTING TO RISE. AND WHAT THIS [inaudible] THIS SHOWS INFANTS PER GALLON. AND DOLLARS PER TON THE HEALTH EFFECTS CREDIT PRICES. IN THE ESERVER GASOLINE BUT SO LOW LEVELS IT WASN'T KERMIT NOMINAL COST EARLY. AND BY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TOTAL WAS ABOUT FOUR POINT SIX CENTS PER GALLON SO. THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT IT IS -- SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF OF CASH TWIN OUT FROM CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS POCKETS. OKAY THEN GOING FORWARD. THE NINE POINT SEVEN THAT WE HAVE IN HERE -- FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE VALUE FOR ALPHA FAST CREDIT PRICES. YEAR TO DATE. NOT AVERAGE AT A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE ALTHOUGH -- BUT THE LATEST VALUES HAVE BEEN LIKE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS A TON. AND THEM THESE HIGHER PRICES REPRESENT. VALUES THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE CREDIT CLEARING MARKET PRICE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. TO FORECAST PRICES IN THIS SYSTEM YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SUPPLY DEMAND BALANCE FOR CREDITS AND DEFICITS ARE GOING TO BE IT'S HARD TO KNOW. BUT IF YOU SAY THAT WE THINK LISTS THAT A RB IS GONNA HAVE A TOUGH TIME. COMING UP WITH ENOUGH CREDITS THAT THIS PROGRAM COULD RUN CLOSE TO THE CREDIT CLEARANCE PRICE. THOSE ARE THE PER GALLON PRICES THE CONSUMERS WOULD BE. THAT'S WHAT THESE PRICES REPRESENT [inaudible] OKAY. AND SO THE BIG SHOCK. CALIFORNIA DRIVERS PAVE A LOT. IN GASOLINE TAXES AND FEES. AND HERE YOU SEE THAT COMPONENTS -- A FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES STATE EXCISE TAX. ALRIGHT UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK FEES THIS STATE [inaudible] ARM. STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAX FEELS UNDER THE CAP WHICH IS THE CAP AND TRADE [inaudible] BAH COMPONENT. AND THEN -- LOOK APPEALS. TO AND SO YOU YOU ADD UP THIS CHART YOU GET ABOUT FORTY TWO CENTS A GALLON MORE. U. S. AVERAGE. OKAY SO WHERE IS THE PROGRAM GO FROM HERE -- IS WE TALKED ABOUT THE RITUAL PROGRAM RITUAL SCHEDULES BEING MODIFIED OUT. TO TWENTY THIRTY AND THE TWENTY TWENTY GOAL GETS CHANGED FROM TO FROM 10% TO SEVEN HAVE PERCENT. THAT'S A GOOD THING [inaudible] BECAUSE A KATHY DESCRIBED IS COSTING PAYMENT. WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME WAS? THE PROGRAM WAS IN FEASIBLE AND THEY NEEDED TO MOVE THE GOAL POSTS. AND SO BY MOVING IT BACK TO SEVEN HALF PERCENT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED THAT [inaudible] NOW. WHAT'S THE PROGRAM GONNA HAVE YOU GONNA IF YOU COULDN'T DECREASE CARBON INTENSITY BY. YEARS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT GASOLINE RIGHT -- THE GRAPHIC REDUCE CARBON TENSELY GASOLINE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF GASOLINE THAT'S THAT'S LET'S GO CONSUMED YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BACK GHASTLY. WHICH IS NOT GONNA BE EASY GIVEN THAT GASOLINE DEMANDS NOT PEAKED. IN THE DESPITE LE ESTIMATES OF ALL KINDS OF FORECASTERS ME INCLUDED -- GASSING MAN HAVE GONE DOWN NO [inaudible] KATHLEEN GETS IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE IT THAT'LL CHANGE BUT IT HASN'T IT HASN'T PICKED YET THAT WE CAN SAY. ANOTHER THING THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THIS PROGRAM IS HIGH OIL PRICES. RIGHT HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD REDUCE. A WELL DEMAND [inaudible] AND AND A LIKELY WOULD SPUR INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION. IN THE SPACE AND HOW IT WOULD SAY THAT THE ONLY SAY THE HEALTHCARE PASSES. HAS SPURRED INNOVATION YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IT FROM PACIFIC ETHANOL INTELLIGENCE PRETTY INNOVATIVE THINGS CONNECTING GARY'S OF PIPELINES AND HEARD. MOVE STUFF AROUND FATS INNOVATION [inaudible] BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH CAN COUNT ON HIGH CRUDE PRICES. GIVEN THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE DRILLERS. IN TEXAS AND NORTH DAKOTA AND PLACES LIKE THAT [inaudible] OKAY SO. HIGH PRICES ARE NEEDED TO ENCOURAGE NEW INVESTMENT. WHO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE THINK MIGHT VERY WELL HAPPEN AS THAT THE REFINERS WILL GET INTERESTED MAKING RENEWABLE DIESEL HER NOBLE GASOLINE? AND SO THEY WILL HIM WE HAVE IMPLY THAT THE PRODUCTION OF THAT HAVE THAT HANGING -- INDUSTRIAL SCALE. SO THAT MIGHT VERY WELL HAPPEN -- CERTAINLY. VERY RAPID ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE VEHICLES IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MEET THE KINDS OF GOALS THAT THEY ARE BE IS TALKING ABOUT. AND THEN ONE OF THINGS THAT. THAT BOTHERED ME OVER THE WEEKEND WAS READING AN ARTICLE ON THE STUFF AND SEE IF YOU SEE AS HAVING A FIGHT WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES OVER. HOW MUCH THEY GONNA SPEND TO PUT IN CHARGING STATIONS I THOUGHT. YOU KNOW THERE'S WHAT ALL WAS EVERYBODY ELSE SPENDING ON THAT STUFF [inaudible] RIGHT. INCOME TAX REBATES UTILITY GREAT INCENTIVES AB ONE EIGHTEEN GRANTS [inaudible] HOV LANES. CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS SENATORS -- CREDIT SALES FOR YOU TO OF ALL THIS STUFF. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUT WHAT TAXPAYERS AND CONSUMERS ARE PAN FOR ALL THAT STUFF. AND I DON'T KNOW. WHICH ONES ARE MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHER ONES. SO. IT SO WHAT WEEK SUGGESTS HERE WAS A CLEARINGHOUSE TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY FOR THE TOTAL COST OF VB INSIDE OF SPENDING PROGRESS. NOT SAYING IT'S A BAD THING I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHICH ONES. ARE THE BEST. AND AND SHOULD GET THE MOST FOCUS. AND THEN CONTINUING THE FAME MORE CREDIT GENERATIONS REQUIRED. TO TO ACHIEVE CARBS GOALS. AND THERE THERE IS A PRETTY LONG LIST OF THINGS. THAT -- THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE AND AND THEN THEY'RE GOING -- TO OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE AS WELL A ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY INTERESTING FOR EXAMPLE WAS ARM. I STEAM GENERATION FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY. A COUPLE OF PROJECTS OUT THERE YOU WOULD USE SOLAR SOLAR POWER TO CREATE STEAM. TO LEARN HOW. TO INJECT IN IN THOSE HEAVY OIL WELLS IN THE KERN COUNTY TAX A COUPLE OF PROJECTS AROUND THAT OUR MATERIAL [inaudible] HAVE DATA. WE'RE GOOD YOU WATCHING PRETTY QUICKLY [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] SO HAVE. BEFORE TODAY MAYBE MAY NOT A BUG UNDERSTOOD THE LC A FAST. BUT NOW I'VE GOT A BASIC UNDERSTANDING SO WE CAN PICK QUESTION. I CAN APPRECIATE THAT LEVEL CONTINUE TESTIMONY THEN COME BACK QUESTIONS. PLEASE YOU I GET UP IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY NAME IS GEORGE FOREMAN TIM THE GRANTS MANAGER WITH US SAN JOAQUIN WAS NO TRANSIT DISTRICT FOR THE BUS SYSTEM WHERE LOCATED OUT OF STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. AND WE WE SERVE THE THE ENTIRETY OF THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY UMMAH. AT FOURTEEN EIGHT SQUARE MILES WE HAVE A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE BUSES -- PARA WE OFFER FIXED ROUTE. SERVICE WITHIN STOCKTON IS WELL IT WENT AS WELL AS INNER CITY TRIPS BETWEEN. ON THE CITY'S IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY -- PROVIDES ROUTES TO THE OF BAY AREA BAR AND SAY AND HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL -- WERE ALSO -- DEPLOYING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION MODES SUCH AS MOBILITY ON DEMAND WHICH IS WHAT UBER LIKE SERVICE. THAT IS -- ALSO EIGHTY ACCEPTABLE AND WE ARE ALL WE ALSO OPERATE A VAN PULL UP PROGRAM. BUT FOR THE COUNTY AS WELL FOR COMMUTERS -- IN OUR TO HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT -- OF THE TRANSIT -- TRANSIT AGENCIES AS FAR AS THE PLANE -- ALTERNATE FUEL TECHNOLOGIES IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE WERE IN THAT ONE OF THE FIRST TO DEPLOY HYBRID OF BUSES AND IN -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE DEPLOYED THE FOR OUR FIRST TWO ELECTRIC BUSES CURRENTLY WE OPERATE TWELVE ELECTRIC BUSES AND WERE OPERATE. ABOUT -- SEVENTEEN BY THE END OF THE YEAR -- SO THE THE LCF LC FF -- WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN RTD'S CAN -- DECISION TO CONVERT TO THEIR MISSION -- BUSES AND THAT'S SPECIFICALLY ARE RECENT. A GOAL OUR BOARD APPROVED TO CONVERT OUR ENTIRE STOCKTON FLEE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND WE ADULTS WE ALSO -- OPERATES SEVERAL BUS RAPID TRANSIT ROUTES OF FOUR ROUTES FIVE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR -- AND WE ARE ALSO PROUD THAT OUR FOURTH BUS RAPID TRANSIT ROUTE-- WOULD SAY IT WAS THE FIRST ALL ELECTRIC BUS RAPID OR ALL BATTERY ELECTRIC BUS RAPID TRANSIT ROUTE IN THE NATION AS WELL -- CHI JUST ASK YOUR QUESTION THERE IS YOU SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN MOVING TO EACH TECHNOLOGY ARE EACH DIFFERENT FEEL TYPE. HAVE YOU SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE BUSES OR ARE THEY ARE THEY MORE EFFICIENT AT THE COSTS. ACOSTA BEING LESS BECAUSE OF FUELS WHEN. COSTS LESS OR IS IT COSTING MORE AND MAINTENANCE OR YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT YOU MOVE FROM SEEMS LIKE YOU MOVE FROM. EACH DIFFERENT METER. THE YEAH WE DEFINITELY SEEN UP. WITH THE DIESEL TO HYBRID WE SOLVE. REDUCTION IN IN THE FIELD ARE USING SO WE'RE ABLE. TO GET SOME MORE MILES PER GALLON ON ON THAT WHEN WE MOVE TO ELECTRIC BUSES WE ALSO SAW. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE COST TO OPERATE -- THE BUS -- SO WE RECEIVED AYE BUT ABOUT A ONE THIRD OF THE COST OF DIESEL -- HOWEVER THAT WAS ALSO GETS WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THAT WAS VERY -- AT THAT PERIOD WHEN WE FIRST STARTED A RUNNER BUT ELECTRIC BUSES. WE HAVE A TWO YEAR WAIVER FROM THE UTILITY COMPANY. TO WAIVE DEMAND CHARGES BECAUSE OUR BUSES THEY DROPPED QUITE A BIT A POWER AND I IN THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE OF THE FAST CHARGE TYPE BUSES. AND SO -- WHEN THAT EXPIRED -- THE THAT BASICALLY LEFT -- FOR US TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THOSE DEMAND CHARGES WHICH ACTUALLY. BECAUSE THAT THE COST TO BE ABOVE WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR THAT ARE DIESEL BUSES HA SO WHAT'S OUR TENT IT WAS REMOVED IT UP COSTING MORE. TO TO RUN THE FLEET YEAH. YEAH. SO -- I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A BILL. I THINK IT'S FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR THAT US -- THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO LOOK AT% OF RATE STRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS USE CAN TO PROMOTE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE BUSES. SEND WERE ALSO LOOKING INTO BATTERY STORAGE AND OTHER THINGS YOU NEED. TO AVOID THOSE COSTS AS WELL I KNOW WE HAVE HEARD OF SOME BUSES I KNOW. I'M OUR OFFICE. THAT SOME ELECTRIC BUSES HAD TROUBLE. NAVIGATING HILLS AND HAVING THE YOU KNOW ONCE IRAQ PASSIVELY IT GOING UP HILLS HAVE BEEN HAVE YOU GUYS HAD ANY OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THOSE ISSUES. THIRD OF THOSE ISSUES BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD THOSE THOSE ISSUES. I THINK THOSE WERE DIFFERENT TYPE OF BUSES AND ALSO -- OUR TERRAIN IS A LOT FLATTER HAVE BEEN THE MOTHER TURNED ON SO WE THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD. THE SAME TYPES OF CHALLENGES THAT METHODS WHICH YOU HEARD OF THAT HAS AN INVITE BOTH YOU OUT TO FORT OF ON MY DISTRICT TO CHECK OUT THE HOME OF GREEN BOSS AND WILL GET YOU BOTH SET OUT GREAT YEAH. GOD PLEASE CONTINUE CLOSER. SO -- THE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEPLOY THIS I'M. YET STOCKTON IS IN THAT DISCIPLINE YOU KNOW COLLECTION OF DISADVANTAGED AREAS -- BOTH ECONOMICALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY SO WE WE AND OUR TV IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. TO MAINTAIN OUR INCREASED SERVICE LEVELS. AND ALSO DELIVERED THIS -- THAT THE QUEEN TECHNOLOGY TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHO DEPEND ON AYE AYE BUSES. AND HELP THEM THE AIR POLLUTION IN THE AREA. AS WELL AS THE THAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- SO ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES WE WANT TO DEPLOY THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR OUR PASSENGERS AS FAR AS VOLUME OF SERVICE. SO WE NEED TO DEPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY. THAT DOESN'T. THAT DOESN'T TAKE OPERATING COSTS WHICH IS VERY PRECIOUS FOR US. MON TO RUN THESE THESE ROUTES EVERY YEAR. IT TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAP INTO. DIFFERENT GRANTS THE DID TO DO TO PLAY MISSILE DEPLOYMENTS OF SOME VEHICLES WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO ALSO -- THAT RELY ON THAT THE H. FIT PROGRAM. TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE THE THE VEHICLES THEMSELVES. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LCD SF IS REALLY -- AS SUCH IT'S SOMETHING TO OFFSET THE COST OF ELECTRICITY THAT. THAT WE PURCHASE A YOU RUN THESE FEARS OF THE INCENTIVES AREN'T THERE ON THE ELECTRIC RATES FOR THE ELECTRIC BUSES IN. GIVEN THAT IT WOULD COST MORE THAN WOULD YOU GUYS LOOK AT USING LIKE REGULAR DIESEL OR BIODIESEL GOING BACK TO THOSE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES OR WHAT WOULD. WHAT DO YOU SEE YOU GUYS HAVE TO SPEAK TO HIM YEAH SO WE WERE HOPING THAT THERE'S A COMBINATION OF? YOU NO STABILIZATION IN THE RATES AS FAR AS THE DEMAND CHARGES ON ON CHARGING THESE THESE VEHICLES THEMSELVES -- YOU KNOW COPING COST THE VEHICLES GETS CONTINUE TO TO GO DOWN -- AS THEY HAVE -- THE H. FIT PROGRAM THAT OR THAT SUPPLEMENTS THE COST ALSO HELPS -- AND WE ALSO EARN CREDITS FOR IT THROUGH THE HEALTHY AT THAT PROGRAM -- BECAUSE WERE WERE WERE MAKING THESE ABOUT ESTIMATES BECAUSE WHAT THE CREDIT YOU CAN OFFSET THE COST BECAUSE YOU COULD SELL YES. EXACTLY SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OUR IT BENEFIT DEFINITELY BENEFITS US IN OUR WRITERS TO BE ABLE TO AND TO MAKE THE TRANSITION. AND STILL MAINTAIN -- THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING AND HOPE. TO GROW THAT AS THE ECONOMY IS IMPROVING A LOT OF OUR FUNDING RESOURCES ARE BASED ON TAX DOLLARS PLEASE GOD YOU SAY YOU GUYS WENT THAT DIRECTION AND BECAUSE OF REGULATIONS FROM THE STATE. AND INCENTIVES THAT WE PROVIDED -- YES ABSOLUTELY YES SO OF THE INCENTIVES AND REGULATIONS TURN THE OTHER WAY. DO YOU THINK MOST CITIES IN THEIR CELLS WOULD CHANGE THE OTHER DIRECTION -- I WOULD SAY BE A HARD DECISION SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT HAVE. TO LOOK OUT HARD AND GATHERED ABOUT GET THE TICKET OFFICE LAWYERS KNEW WHAT IS THE COST. WELL HOW MANY YOU KNOW HOW MUCH AVIANO JUST GIVE YOU THE FEATHER MOST CITIES I THINK -- THAT ALL THE WRITING ON THE WALLS OF THE STATE PUSHED IN ONE DIRECTION AND MOVE THAT WAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IN AND BUDGET WHICH IS WHY YOU GUYS ARE WHERE YOU'RE AT AND I KNOW THAT'S WHY A LOT OF OUR OUR CITIES ARE WHERE THEY ARE TO YEAH DEFINITELY I MEAN WE'VE. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT BUT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY SEEN THE REGULATIONS COM AND YOU KNOW IT'S AYE MODEL GOTTARDO DOWN THE COST NOW DOESN'T IT YEAH. APPRECIATE THAT ON A FEW FINISHING JUST MONEY FEE OF ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY -- SO WOULD I WOULD JUST THAT CLOSE WITH THAT THE HEALTHIER -- I'LL SEE IF. THAT'S PROGRAM BOTH ENCOURAGES PARA TRANSIT AGENCIES TO MAKE. MAKE THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN THIS TECHNOLOGY AND IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE INDUSTRY'S -- THAT SUPPLY THE VEHICLES THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURES -- AND AT THE SAME TIME IT. DOESN'T MAKE US MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN OPERATING DOLLARS IT'S HARD TO INVEST THIS IN. NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR DO WE INVEST AND REINVEST THIS INTO.-OUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND SERVICE CALLER THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT LET ME ASK -- SIR -- HACK INTO QUESTION. S. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M EARLIER PANEL WE HAD DISCUSSION ABOUT. WHAT THE COST WAS OF THIS PER OF LCF ASKS? AND THOSE LITTLE BIT OF DISCREPANCY BETWEEN SOME OF THE PANELISTS IN TERMS OF THE COST BUT FROM YOUR ANALYSIS AND IF YOU GET ONE OF THE SLIDES ON IT. ORDER THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT ARE AFFECTING. PRICING THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE ACTUAL MARKET [inaudible] POP THAT. OKAY SO THIS. COUPLE YEARS A HISTORY. IN WHAT WE'RE OFFERING CCS A MAJOR DIPS. ALL ONE IN THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN AND THEN ANOTHER. ONE LAKE WINNER THIS YEAR. RIGHT SO THE SUMMER SIXTEEN WAS WHEN. THE RUMOR MILL HAD AT THE GOVERNOR WAS GOING TO TRADE LCF PASS FOR CAPTAIN TRADES. FOR AND SO EVERYBODY WHO WAS HOW HOLDEN ELSE IF S. CREDITS BAILED OUT. AND ON THE MARKET LOST HALF ITS VALUE. AND THEN. EARLIER THIS YEAR. THERE WERE THERE WAS -- A LOT OF CONCERN IN THE MARKETPLACE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CARBS PROPOSED [inaudible] CHANGE. TO THE THE CHANGE TO TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM MARKET TOOK A BIG. DEPP AT THAT POINT AS WELL SO -- WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT -- CERTAINLY TO THE DOWNSIDE THIS MARKET IS DRIVEN BY SENTIMENT. YOU KNOW OR FEAR RED MARK MARKETS ARE LIKE THAT -- AND THEN THAT THE BIG INCREASE THAT YOU'VE SEEN REALLY STARTING FROM. SEVENTEEN YOU COULD YOU COULD OBSERVE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CREDIT BANK CREDIT BANK WOULD BUILD A CREDIT BANK SLOWED IN SIXTEEN AND STOPPED IN. SEVENTEEN AND NOW HERE WE ARE NAY TO THIS DON'T CORLEY BASIS THAT'S GOING TO BE -- PROLLY SOON THE THAT THE NEXT QUARTER. STUFF WILL BE OUT FIRST QUARTER BE OUT WILL GET AN IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON THE BUT WHO THINK THAT THAT. PRETTY [inaudible] RAPID. CLIMB THERE IS SOME MARKET TRYING TO GET POSITION SO THAT THEY PEOPLE WHO ARE CREATING THE DEFICITS WILL HAVE CREDITS. NOR DID MEET THEIR OBLIGATION ON FORWARD. CUT SO DO YOU SEE PEOPLE NOW RUSHING BACK TO BUY THOSE CREDITS SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE BECAUSE WORD. THEN TO SPEAK PEOPLE. NEEDING THEM IS THAT WERE YES HAVE STARTED WE WERE SERIOUS STRENUOUSLY NOW TO SAY THAT WOULD BE WOULD GO TO THE CREDIT BALANCE. THING HERE. WHERE YOU SEE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF SEVENTEEN HAD US SLIGHT DRAW -- I THINK OUR EXPECTATION FOR CREDIT BALANCE DRAWS BY QUARTER FOR EIGHTEEN HAS. ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CREDITS A QUARTER [inaudible] WHICH IS -- YOU KNOW. PRETTY GOOD HUNK OF THOSE STEPS THAT YOU SEE THERE. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY BIGGER THAN. MAYBE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE DRAW THAT YOU SEE THE FIRST QUARTER OF SEVENTEEN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CONSUMERS ARE AWARE OF THE CONSUMER IMPACTS OF THIS. WOULD MEAN FOR CONSUMERS SAYS THAT -- IN IS THAT THE PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO GO OFF. WHAT WE'VE ILLUSTRATED HERE FOR EIGHTEEN IS -- AVERAGES NINE POINT SEVEN CENTS PER GALLON THAT'S ON SLIDE TWELVE BUT INDEED. FRIDAY'S PRICE LAST FRIDAY'S PRICE IN CENTS PER GALLON WAS MORE LIKE THIRTEEN CENTS PER GALLON. AND AND IF SO -- IF THE MARKET AND WE DON'T AND WE DON'T THINK THAT THE MARKET WILL GET TO THEIR CREDIT CLEARING PRICE -- THIS YEAR ALONE THAT THERE'S A CHANCE OF THAT -- BUT IF THAT HAPPENS THEN THE NUMBERS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY CENTS A GALLON. WILL SHOW UP IN YOU KNOW AT THE PUMP. SO ANA BUT IMAGINE EVERYBODY'S ANTICIPATING AIR VIS REGULATIONS SEE WHAT THAT'S ACTUALLY MEAN FOR EVERYONE RIGHT. WELL -- BUT BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE THEY NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE THE REGULATION THEY NEED JUST. TO TO SMOOTH OUT THIS. CATHOLIC TALKED ABOUT IT BEING BACK AND LET IT. WELL WHAT HAPPENED WAS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LEARN ENOUGH CREDITS OUT THERE. TO HIT 10%. BY. TWENTY TWENTY AND I HAVEN'T. AND YOU KNOW IT'S THIS BEEN ASPIRATIONAL ALL ALONG HAVEN'T BEEN THAT MANY CREDITS OUT THERE. AND SO BY SMOOTHING THAT THE PROGRAM OUT SEVEN HALF WE THINK THAT THE BANK WILL STILL THE SOLID BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE OTHER. TWENTY TWENTY NINE BUT BUT NOT MUCH AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT KIND OF ALL LONG. WE HAVE BEEN. A LOT MORE CREDITS ABOUT TO BE GENERATED THIS PROGRAM OR TO KEEP IT SOLVENT [inaudible] GOING FORWARD [inaudible] GOT IT. OKAY MASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS [inaudible] NOW. APPRECIATE PRESENTATION I KNOW. WHERE THAT RELY ON THIS INFORMATION AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT APPRECIATE HOW YOU ACTUALLY CRAFTED ALL OUT OVER THE YEARS OF THE QUARTERS? RIGHT AS RAIN REPORTS OF THANK YOU AND I JUST THINK THAT IF PLEASE WORK WITH THE LA ON THE S. AND AND GET THAT OKAY. DATA AND AND RELATE THAT BACK TO OUR OFFICES AS WE GO FORWARD GOT HAPPY TO DO THAT THANK. ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO I'D MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. AND THEN WE WILL CONCLUDE A PLACE. YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND WE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FOR THE RECORD THAT BE APPRECIATED. THANKS VERY MUCH CHAIR SALAS AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MANAGE GRAHAM NOISE I'M A FUEL REGULATORY ATTORNEY IN TOWN AND ALSO A LEAD UP THE LOW CARBON FUELS COALITION. ARE START BY SAYING I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD -- IT'S REGARDED BY MANY AS THE BEST -- DESIGN PROGRAM IN THE WORLD -- FOR DIVERSIFYING THE TRANSPORTATION FUEL MIX -- AND I JUST WANT TO PICK UP ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE REPEATEDLY DISCUSSED YEAR I APPRECIATE THAT EVERYONE'S HERE PAST FIVE O'CLOCK ALREADY SO ONCE A ONE HIT THINGS FAST BUT GLAD TO BE RESOURCE GOING FORWARD -- TO UP TO THIS SUBCOMMITTEE -- A FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS. DON'T DO AS IT FOCUSES IN ON THE TOUGHEST SECTOR THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHICH HAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA OTHER SECTORS DON'T DIRECTLY ADDRESS THAT SECTOR'S SO THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE GONNA NATURALLY GO TO THE EASIER PLACES SO TO SPEAK -- WE'RE NEVER GOING TO ADDRESS -- TRANSPORTATION IF THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN OUT WERE ALSO NEVER GOING TO ACHIEVE A FUEL DIVERSIFICATION. I AND WE ARE -- REMAIN A STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S HIGHLY DEPENDED ON PETROLEUM PRODUCTS -- AND WITH THEM ARE ALSO THE CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS AS WELL AS THE GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSIONS THAT GO WITH THEM ARE WE SEEING THIS PROGRAM REDUCE -- OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION METRIC TONS A OF POLLUTANTS TO DATE IT'S ALSO RELIEVING PRESSURE FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM -- WITH THOSE -- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS -- AND THEREBY SAVING COSTS. OBVIOUSLY COST WAS A HUGE FACTOR THAT EVERYONE TALKED ABOUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THIS DISCUSSION -- FRANKLY I THINK WITH WITH DUE RESPECT TO ALL I THINK THE THE THE COST ANALYSIS -- WAS A LITTLE BIT SIMPLISTIC AND ARE ALL OF THE COST OF THE L. CFS AND IMPUTED IT TO THE GALLON SO IT SAID IF THE L. CFS COSTS IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS A METRIC TON. WILL FIGURE OUT WHATTHAT COSTS A COT ACROSS THE A GALLON OF GASOLINE -- DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE FACT -- THAT CALIFORNIA IS A VERY -- LEAN OUR MARKET INTERNS ARE GASOLINE SUPPLY IN PARTICULAR -- THOSE THAT HAVE FOLLOWED WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE C. C. IN TERMS OF THE MASSIVE PRICE SPIKES WE'VE SEEN IN GASOLINE ON KNOW THAT THOSE RESULT FROM JUST. SMALL REFINERY REDUCTION SO I THINK WE REALLY OUGHT TO BE -- THINKING ABOUT THE MARGINAL COST OF GASOLINE. ALSO THE POINTS -- THAT NEIL AND JOE BROUGHT UP -- ABOUT ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL BOTH BEING COST SAVERS -- AND THE FACT THAT OFTENTIMES DEAL CFS CREDIT IS NOT JUST GOING -- TO THE LOW CARBON FUEL IT'S ALSO OFTEN BEING SHARED -- BY THE PETROLEUM DISTRIBUTOR ON THAT SIDE OF SO I THINK THAT COST ANALYSIS -- IS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN A LOT MORE DEPTH ON THE OTHER THING I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN ON IS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE EXPERIENCE TO DATE. IN THE PROGRAM -- WITH THE DE UP THE SLIDES PRESENTED HERE ON PAGE TWELVE THE COST PER GALLON -- EVEN WITH THAT SIMPLISTIC APPROACH FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS FOUR POINT SIX CENTS PER GALLON THAT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR CAP AND TRADE PRICES OVER THE RACK. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NO COST BECAUSE FOR ALARM -- WE'VE SEEN THESE KINDS OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THIS PROGRAM NOW SINCE IT STARTED SEVEN YEARS AGO -- AND SO I WOULD SAY LOOK AT THE HISTORY WE HAVE LOOK ALSO AT WHAT CARD IS DOING TO ADJUST DOWN THESE ARE SHORT YEARS HERE. BECAUSE OF CONCERNS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF COST CONCERNS AS WELL UP SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I DO REALLY APPRECIATE ALSO THE INTEREST IN. A DRIVING IN STATE PRODUCTION -- DOZER AS AS WAS DISCUSSED THOSE ARE SECRET PROBLEMS IN PERMITTING PROBLEMS IN NIMBY PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO KEEP MORE THESE DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING JULIA LEVIN WITH A BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT MORE THAN SEVENTY PUBLIC AGENCIES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO ENERGY. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE BELIEVE THAT IS PROVIDING A LOT OF BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA INCLUDING A LOT OF IN STATE INVESTMENT. OF ALL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SAVINGS AND HEALTH RELATED -- AT THE AIR POLLUTION RELATED HEALTH COSTS IT'S HEDERA. HAVING SAID THAT THERE ARE TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE PROGRAM WHICH ACTUALLY HAVE COME OUT IN A NUMBER OF THE COMMENTS IN PRESENTATIONS TODAY. ONE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE FOCUS IN STATE AND TERRACE HOUSE I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT COSTS AND BENEFITS. THEY'RE VERY FEW BENEFITS TO SUBSIDIZING OUT OF STATE FUELS PRODUCTION AND AND NO BENEFITS AT THOSE FUELS DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE IT. TO CALIFORNIA WHICH HAPPENS WITH A LOT OF THE BIO MAT THING THAT WE'RE SUBSIDIZING. ITS LANDFILL GAS FROM TEXAS OR OHIO OR OTHER STATES THAT NEVER ACTUALLY IS EVEN DELIVER TO CALIFORNIA. YOU ALL KNOW FROM YOUR DISTRICTS. I'M TERRACE SALAS ASSEMBLYMAN MATHIS YOU HAVE A WEALTH OF DAIRY FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL WASTE THAT WE SHOULD BE CONVERTED TO ENERGY INSTEAD OF LAND FILLING IT OR BURNING THAT. OR LETTING IT GO UP IN A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE ASSEMBLYMAN GIBSON HAS TOURED ONE OF MY MEMBERS FACILITIES THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS. WHERE THEY'RE NOT ONLY CONVERTING WASTE WATER BY A GAS TO ENERGY BUT TAKING IN FOOD WASTE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO A LANDFILL? THESE FACILITIES PROVIDED A LOT OF PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS THEY CAN ALSO PROVIDE JOBS AND A LOT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AS THE FACILITY AT LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT US IN ALL OF YOUR COMMUNITIES AND TREES AROUND THE STATE THAT REALLY NEED MORE JOBS. WE DON'T GET THOSE BENEFITS WHEN THE FUELS ARE PRODUCED OUT OF STATE AND WE GET NO BENEFITS IF THEY'RE NOT DELIVER TO CALIFORNIA SO. I DO ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT HOW. TO FOCUS THE LTFS PROGRAM MORE ON FUELS THAT ARE PRODUCED AND USED TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS AND THEN THE COST BENEFIT. EQUATION CHANGES SUBSTANTIALLY THE OTHER REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE IS UNTIL RECENTLY I THINK ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THE LC OF US PROGRAM WAS ITS FUEL NEUTRALITY THAT WAS ENTIRELY BASED. ON A LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS OF THE CARBON INTENSITY THE AIRBOARD IS QUICKLY MOVING AWAY FROM FUEL NEUTRALITY AND SOME OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES THAT THE ALEJO HIGHLIGHTED. EMPHASIZE THAT IN THEIR ADDITIONAL CHANGES AS WELL. THAT WOULD REALLY BENEFIT ELECTRIC VEHICLES. A AND HURT BIOFUELS WHICH AS SEVERAL BECAUSE OF THAT OUR THE LION'S SHARE OF ELSE IF US PROGRAM. ARE AND ALSO HELP TO KEEP THE COST DOWN ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE. IN TERMS OF THE POUND OF CARBON REDUCTION OR A POUND OF AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION. SO THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO REMAINED FUEL NEUTRAL AND FOCUSED ON A DIVERSITY OF FUELS TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS AND MINIMIZE THE COST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT OF THOSE COMMENTS AND IF WE LOOK INTO SOME OF THOSE THINGS ON THAT NOTE JUNE ON ASKING ALL THE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION -- JUST WANT TO SAY THAT KELLY DC IS A LONGTIME SUPPORTER OF THE LC A FAST AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO ALL THE BENEFITS IF YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM EVERYBODY ELSE BOTH ECONOMIC AND JOBS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BY DO YOU JUST WANNA MAKE A PLUG. FOR A ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR TRANS AFTER ELECTRICITY IS A VERY CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUEL REDUCING CLIMATE CHANGE POLLUTANTS BY 75%. AND TOXIC AIR POLLUTANTS BY OVER ELECTRICITY GETS CLEANER OVERTIME AS A RESULT OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS -- SO -- ELECTRIC VEHICLES ACTUALLY ARE GETTING CLEANER AS THEY AGE. A AND KELLY PCS COMPLETED A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE INDICATING THAT ELECTRICITY GRID CAN -- HANDLE AND ACCOMMODATE THIS TRANSITION TO ELECTRIFICATION AND IN FACT ELECTRIFICATION IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT THE GRANT AND ALL ACTRESS CITY USERS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THEY DRIVE ANY BE. UP THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNIST BEACON THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING APPRECIATE. HI THERE MARY SELECCIONES AJW WE REPRESENT AND MANY DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROVIDERS. AND JUST A FEW COMMENTS -- THE FIRST OF ABOUT THE% ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE NOW AS A RESULT OF THE L. CFS. BECAUSE OF THE LTFS THERE ARE NOW ALTERNATIVES IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE THEY YOU SEE AT THE PUMP. TO DAY YOU HAVE CHOICES WHEN WE SOON STARTED THE LCF US PROGRAM TEN YEARS AGO I WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A DREAM AND NAY BEING NOT COST EFFECTIVE FOR A LOT OF FOLKS NOW YOU'RE SEEING. NATURAL GAS ELECTRIC VEHICLES USE EVEN SEEN HYDROGEN THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THERE THERE'S FLEX FUEL VEHICLES THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEHICLES NOW THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT OF THIS PROGRAM AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS CHOICE ALTERNATIVES. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THAT FOR SINCE IT'S AT THE TOP OF THE ON ON TOP OF THE PRICE OF GASOLINE TODAY. YEAH THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF COST BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS ADDRESS THAT UNDERLYING THREE TO FIVE DOLLARS THAT SWINGS THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. BY USING SOME DOMESTIC SOURCES OF FUELS AND THAT'S WHAT THE THE BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE PROGRAM AND BY A LOT OF THE METRICS THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE TODAY WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THE OTHER MAJOR THING THAT I'D LIKE TO HEAD ON IS ABOUT. THE DUPLICATION QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD AND THE EARLIER ON THE EARLIER PANELS [inaudible] AND WE DID A A STUDY WITH TELSTAR ACTUALLY. I'M SORRY WITH AYE CALLIE T. SEE -- A FEW YEARS AGO THAT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PRICE OF CAP AND TRADE ABSENT THE OCI PASS. AND IT ESSENTIALLY SPIKES BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT THAT SIGNIFICANT DRAWDOWN OF PA CARBON INTENSITY THROUGH THE LCF US THEN. IT GOES TO THIS ECONOMY WIDE PROGRAM CAPTAIN TRAITS GOING TO BECOME MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE ECONOMY WIDE. BUT THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE CALLIE T. C. WEBSITES I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT. AND IN TERMS OF AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME AND THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT WHY ARE WE DOING THIS PROGRAM TWICE. THEN I ALWAYS LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS AS AN ANALOGY OR A AND I I LIKE TO COMPARE THIS TO THEIR NOBLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THIS IS THERE AN OVAL PORTFOLIO STANDARD FOR THE FUEL SECTOR FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. WE'RE TRYING TO DIVERSE OF MAURY NOBLE CONTENT AND SIEU THAT PORTION OF OUR ENERGY MIX THIS IS BEATS BUT SET UP CUSTOM TAILORED PORTION OF THE MARKET. PROGRAM THAT WE NEED TO DRAW DOWN THE THAT CARBON BECAUSE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AYE AYE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M A RYAN KENNY WITH CLEAN ENERGY. WE ARE A AYE CALIFORNIA SUCCESS STORY BECAUSE OF IN PART BECAUSE THE L. CFS WERE BASED IN NEWPORT BEACH WE HAVE HUTCHEON SIXTY FIVE AYE STATIONS ALONG HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ALL PROVIDE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS OR OR BY METHANE -- THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LCF BASS IN THE RAIN CREDITS MEGAN IT MADE POSSIBLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH DIESEL FUEL. AND OF COURSE THAT ALLOWS US TO BE PART THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT'S A SUCCESS STORY. AND ALLOWING US -- TO REMOVED THIRTY DIESEL FROM HIGHWAYS AND I REPLACE IT WITH CLEAN -- FILE FEELS AND HOW WE DO -- EMPHASIZE THAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD REMAIN I FEEL NEUTRAL AND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME -- EFFORTS TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS RECENTLY WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THE LEGISLATURE I AB ONE EIGHTEEN BEING ONE OF THEM -- BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE URGE STILL THE LEGISLATURE TO PLEASE I MAKE SURE THAT. THE POLICIES ARE FUELING TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AYE THERE IS ROOM FOR ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES AND IS ALSO ROOM FOR A SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGY. AYE WE CAN'T REMOVE THREE DIESEL -- THROUGH -- LOW CARBON FEELS TODAY INCLUDING EVERYONE AFTER GAS SO THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING WILL BARRETT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ARE ORGANIZATIONS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE L. CFS. I GOING BACK TO ITS ORIGINS AS WELL AS OF THE EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM. IN OREGON AS THEY'VE ADOPTED A SIMILAR -- WE DO THIS BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF CLIMATE POLLUTION AND AIR POLLUTION THAT HARMS PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA -- THE CHALLENGE VERY POLLUTION ARE WELL KNOWN INCREASED ASTHMA ATTACKS CHILDHOOD LONG DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS LUNG CANCER HEART ATTACKS IN PREMATURE DEATHS -- SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IS DONE SHOWS THAT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS A CRITICAL TOOL IN REDUCING THE HARM. CAUSED BY OF FOSSIL FUEL USE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. ARE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN REPORT ON THE ARTIFACTS FOUND THAT -- WE COULD AVOID IT BILLION DOLLARS IN CLIMATE RELATED -- CHALLENGES EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ROUGHLY AND THEIR POLLUTION RELATED HEALTH IMPACTS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INCLUDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTED ASTHMA TAXING CALIFORNIA. OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AFFORDED LOST WORK DAYS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF CLEANER AIR. AS A RESULT OF THIS SHOW DEFERRED DIVERSIFICATION. PROCESS THROUGH THE LC FS SO ISN'T PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD WE WE LOOK FORWARD TO INCREASE SUCCESS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE AIR BE -- ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND AND MOVING THE PROGRAM FORWARD WITH A STRONGER TARGET. FOR TWENTY THIRTY REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THAT PATH TOWARDS ELECTRIFICATION THAT WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO MEET OUR CLEANER CLIMATE GOALS ACHIEVED. AND THAT -- THESE HEALTH BENEFITS CONTINUE TIME SO AS A WHOLE -- AS A CONCLUSION THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA HAS COME OUT STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THE SUCCESSES OF THE PROGRAM. AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS IS A CRITICAL CLEANER POLICY GOING FORWARDS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING HER TODAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IS A COMMITTEES STEAM WITNESSES I'M DAVID WEISKOPF FROM THE NEXT GEN AMERICA -- IN ADDITION -- TO RESTATING OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD -- AND CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICIES IN GENERAL. I'D LIKE TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT ON WHEN MATTER IS BANNISTER HACKETT -- WHICH IS THE NEED -- FOR INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF LOW CARBON FUELS IN ORDER TO HELP -- THIS MARKET CONTINUE TO GROW AND TO CONTINUE TO KEEP PRICES LOW AND MANAGEABLE AT THE PUMP. A NEXTGEN ALONG WITH OUR FRIENDS AT SERIES IN THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS ARM. I'VE RECENTLY COSPONSORED A STUDY THERE WAS CARRIED OUT BY DR CHRIS MAYLANDS OF US RELIGION WHOSE -- NUMBER OF THE ARE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL CENTER VICE RE COMMITTEE. OF THIS STUDY FOUND THAT ON THE TWENTY THIRTY TIME FRAME. THE 20% TARGET IS ACTUALLY QUITE CONSERVATIVE -- SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FUELS OF WELL ABOVE THAT 20% THRESHOLD. I WILL BE AVAILABLE AT VERY -- REASONABLE PRICE. CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES ON THE AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU MEMBERS -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OR OTHERS IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. PLEASE DROP THAT OFTEN WILL MAKE SURE GETS TEACHER THE MEMBERS GREAT THANK YOU. I THINK IT AFTERNOON THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS JOY A LAFIA AND I'M WITH THE WESTERN PROPANE GAS ASSOCIATION. AND MY COMMENTS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE SO BEAR WITH ME. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS AN AREA AND ELSIE OF US THAT SHOULD BE POTENTIALLY REEVALUATED. AND AS YOU MAY KNOW THE LC A FAST COVERS BOTH TRANSPORTATION AND COMMERCIAL FORKLIFTS. AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT INDOOR FORKLIFTS THEY DO NOT RUN ON AYE EITHER GASOLINE OR DIESEL. SO THE PURPOSE OF LCF* TO DISPLACE THIRTY GAS WINTERS. DIESEL WITH THEM ALTERNATIVE FUELS WITH THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING FOR INDOOR FORKLIFTS THOUGH WE ASK THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO PERHAPS SEGMENT. OUTDOOR FORKLIFTS VERSUS INDOOR FORKLIFTS AND EXTRACT INDOOR FORKLIFTS TO ME I'LL SEE A FAST. AND I ALSO ECHO THE STATEMENTS AND BEING -- FUEL TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. NATIONAL PUBLIC COMMENTS. HEARING AND SEEING THAT ALTER BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE DIETS FOR CONCLUDING REMARKS -- THE FAT I'LL BEGIN I JUST SAY YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA THANK ALL STAKEHOLDERS OF PEOPLE STICKING IT OUT A LITTLE BIT PAST. FIVE ONE LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT I THINK IT WAS DISCUSSION THAT WAS MUCH NEEDED AT THE DISCUSSION. IT'S A LITTLE WONKY. RIGHT LITTLE BIT IN THE WEEDS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT TO RESPONSIBLY AND MOVE FORWARD ON CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE OR WE'RE GOING TO GO. THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD QUESTIONS. THAT WERE ASKED AND ANSWERED. I KNOW WHICH LET US MORE QUESTIONS. AND POSSIBLY ANOTHER HEARING DEPENDING ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDES TO DO AS THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD -- WITH THEIR POLICIES AND WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY MEANS FOR STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S. I ENERGY FUTURE ALSO WHAT THAT MEANS TO CONSUMERS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE WE TYPICALLY HEAR IT AS WELL -- WATER THE EFFICIENCIES WHAT ARE THE COSTS HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS AND YOU KNOW WE MASS HELIO TODAY DELVE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO IT AND POSSIBLY BRING IN THEIR BE -- AFTER THEY DEVELOP THE REGULATIONS KINDA DISCUSS ABOUT WHY THEY WENT ABOUT THE WAY THEY WENT ABOUT IT [inaudible] AND PAGE ONE THINK AIR EVERYBODY FOR COMING OUT TODAY AND STAY TUNED. FOR FOR THE NEXT ONE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THANKS VERY MUCH -- CERTAINLY HAS BEEN INFORMATIVE FOR ME AND I DO APOLOGIZE -- OUR DEMANDS -- ARE RIGHT A LOT ANA SPIRIT RUN. TO AND FRO THE NUMBER OF COMMITTEES BUT THE INFORMATION I HAVE IN FACT RECEIVED ON HIS VERY ENLIGHTENING I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEEDS. TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER CERTAINLY RECOMMEND ANOTHER SUCH HEARING -- BY BRINGING SOME OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE AND IT WAS A BUSY DAY SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WANTED TO COME BUT THEY WERE POORLY MANY DIRECTIONS I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN. ONE HIS LEADERSHIP AND ALSO AS VISION OMINOUS PARTICOLARE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IS THE CONVERSATION THESE TAKE PLACE NOW THINGS ARE IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS LOOKING AT WHAT FACE I'M CALIFORNIA -- WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND I THINK WE CAN ALL COEXIST BY WORKING TOGETHER AND WORKING OUT A SOLUTION THAT BEST FIT. ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S AGAIN THING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. THANK MISS GIPSON BEING HERE WITH US. ALRIGHT WITH THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE THAT THIS HEARING BY FORTY THINK RING. MANAGING [inaudible] THANK -- ABSOLUTE
