00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.267
TWO YEARS YOU KNOW I THINK THE

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:05.036

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:06.437
OF ALL THIS WHERE WE WANT TO

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:08.072
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN BUT WE KNOW

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.540
THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.142
SERVED OUR CHILDREN I PERSONALLY

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:13.578
DON'T ALLOW MY KIDS ON INSTAGRAM

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:15.546
FACEBOOK TECH TOP SNAPCHAT I

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.981
DON'T ALLOW THAT AS A PARENT

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:18.983
MY KIDS ARE FOURTEEN ELEVEN AND

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.751
I THINK I'VE AS A LEGISLATOR

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:21.953
I THINK I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:23.221
THE HUMAN TRAFFIC INSIDE AND

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:24.322
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:25.690
MY KIDS AND SO THEY DON'T

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:27.291
WANT TO BE ON THOSE PLATFORMS

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:29.227
THE PLATFORMS LIKE DISCORD

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.395
OR YOU TO MY DAUGHTER TAUTER

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:32.997

HERE TELL US ALL HOW TO CROCHET

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.367
A BECAUSE YOU WATCH A TWO MINUTE

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:37.635
VIDEO ON YOUTUBE SO THERE ARE

00:35:37.902 --> 00:35:39.103
BENEFITS OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.872
PLATFORMS SO HOW DO WE KEEP THE

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:43.007
BENEFITS AND THAT INNOVATION BUT

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:45.076
HOW DO WE THEN REALLY PROTECT

00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:47.245
OUR KIDS FROM THE KIND OF SHADOW

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:49.113
SIDE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT'S

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.781
THE BALANCE I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:53.117
ASK OURSELVES AND WE KNOW

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.285
THAT THERE'S CONSUMPTION WE KNOW

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.187
THIS DEPENDENCE ON IT SO HOW

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:58.356
DO WE TAKE THESE FORMING BRAINS

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:01.359
AND AND ENSURE THAT ALL PARTIES

00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:03.494
WHETHER THAT'S PARENTS SCHOOLS

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:05.129
GOVERNMENT BY THE PLATFORMS

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:06.998
THEMSELVES ALL ARE ROWING IN

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:08.766
THE SAME DIRECTION TO PROTECT

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.034
OUR KIDS AND I THINK THERE'S

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:11.202
MORE WE COULD DO AND THAT'S THE

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:12.570
QUESTION HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:14.038
OUT OF TODAY'S HEARING IS HOW

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.840
DO WE BALANCE THAT ALL OUT AND

00:36:15.907 --> 00:36:17.241
SPECIFICALLY I HAVE THAT I HAVE

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:18.876

IS INCREDIBLY DISTURBING SO

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.224
WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.792

WITHIN THE FIELD OF YOUTH MENTAL

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.515
HEALTH I CAN CONFIRM THAT THE

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:39.016
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS REAL

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.918
AND HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR YEARS

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.219
THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOCIAL

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:43.554
MEDIA IS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.589
CRISIS IS STILL UNCLEAR AND

00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:47.058
MUCH MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:48.592
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.394
HEAVIEST USERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:51.996
OUR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.564

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:55.499
LIMITED LIFE EXPERIENCE LEAVE

PLATFORMS NOT DESIGNED WITH

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.372
THEIR BEST INTEREST IN MIND

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.174
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK TO

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.076
AN ERA WHEN THESE INNOVATIONS

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:06.477
WERE NOT EMBEDDED IN THE DAILY

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:08.212
EXPERIENCES OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.081
OR IN OUR SOCIAL FABRIC FROM

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:11.716
COMMERCE TO EDUCATION TO THE

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:14.151
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ITSELF BUT

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.553
WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:17.021
CHANGE COURSE AND RENEW OUR

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.522
APPROACH IN ORDER TO BUILD SAFER

AND HEALTHIER ONLINE COMMUNITIES

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.359
LET'S FIRST TAKE A MOMENT TO

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:23.861
CONSIDER WHAT A TYPICAL ONLINE

00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:25.663
EXPERIENCE LOOKS LIKE FOR A TEAM

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.965
TODAY THE TECH THEIR FRIENDS

IN BETWEEN CLASSES WORKSHOPS

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:35.773
OR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.707
BY SCROLLING THROUGH THEIR

FEEDS USUALLY ACROSS FORTY

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:39.844
FIVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA

00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:43.714
COMMENT AND SHARE INSPIRING

EDITED AND DELETED SEVERAL TIMES

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.087
BEFORE THEY LOOK JUST RIGHT

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.856
THEY'LL SPEND HOURS GAMING WITH

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.357
FRIENDS CHATTING WITH FAMILY

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:54.925
GETTING LOST IN FUNNY VIDEOS

ACCESS SCHOOL ITSELF THROUGH

AN EDUCATIONAL PORTAL PORTAL

THEY SEE WILL BE HEAVILY CURATED

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.312
MANY WILL MAKE THEM SMILE AND

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.314
LAUGH BUT JUST AS MANY WILL MAKE

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.083
THEM FEEL ENVIOUS AND INSECURE

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.584
DON'T WONDER WHY THEY DON'T

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.052
LOOK LIKE THAT OR WHAT FILTERS

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.921
WERE USED AS THEY SCROLL THE

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:25.489
CONTENT ALL STARTS TO LOOK THE

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.258
SAME BUT THEY CAN'T PULL AWAY

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:29.360
MISINFORMATION IS EVERYWHERE

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:30.961
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT AND

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.930
HATE SPEECH IS COMMON THEY'LL

SEE DISTURBING IMAGES ON A

REGULAR BASIS BUT NOT REPORT

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:37.001
THEM TO THE PLATFORM SINCE THEY

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.068
DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL DO MUCH

00:40:38.135 --> 00:40:39.804
GOOD THEY WON'T TALK TO THEIR

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.105
PARENTS OR GUARDIANS ABOUT THE

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.007
DISTURBING THINGS THEY SAW MAYBE

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:44.408
OUT OF EMBARRASSMENT OR FEAR

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:45.576
THAT THEIR PARENTS WILL IMPOSE

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:47.111
RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ACCESS

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:49.113
AND THEY WILL BE BOMBARDED WITH

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.848
TARGETED ADS THAT SEEM TO FOLLOW

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:53.584
THEM WHEREVER THEY GO HE'S

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:54.852
YOUNG PEOPLE TURNED TO SOCIAL

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.554
MEDIA FOR CONNECTION CREATIVITY

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.556
INFORMATION CURIOSITY AND FUN

00:40:59.023 --> 00:40:59.824
BUT THEY'RE HAVING TO WORK

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.125
HARDER AND HARDER TO FILTER OUT

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.359
THE BAD IN SEARCH OF THE GOOD

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:04.028
AND THEY'RE MOSTLY HAVING TO

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:05.362
NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:06.997
THE ONLINE WORLD ON THEIR OWN

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:08.899
IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUNG

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:10.067
PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TROUBLED BY THE

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.435
DEGREE TO WHICH THEIR PERCEIVED

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:13.070
VALUE ON SOCIAL MEDIA SEEMS TO

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.371
BE HUSING THAT THEIR EMERGING

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:16.540
IDENTITY NUMBERS OF LIKES

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:17.875
FOLLOWS COMMENTS AND SHARES

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.243
HAVE BECOME A SKEWED CURRENCY

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.145
OF ADOLESCENTS LIVING UP TO

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:22.980
SOCIAL MEDIA'S EXPECTATIONS HAS

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:24.715
CREATED A POWERLESSNESS THAT

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:25.916
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE COME TO

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:28.085
ACCEPT SEEING OF SOCIALLY VIABLE

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.954
ALTERNATIVES IN OTHER WORDS THE

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.555
STEEP COST OF BEING A TEENAGER

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:33.891
TODAY WHY DO WE ALLOW THIS TO

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:35.192
BE THE NORM FOR OUR YOUNGEST AND

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:36.861
MOST IMPRESSIONABLE IT DOESN'T

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:39.029
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY INSTEAD WHY

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:40.331
AREN'T PLATFORMS COMPETING TO

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:42.399
BUILD PRODUCTS THAT MOST EMPOWER

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:44.335
SUPPORT AND INSPIRE OUR YOUTH

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.003
STILL ALLOWING FOR INNOVATION

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.338
BUT MOVING AWAY FROM THE CURRENT

00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.373
AD BASED REVENUE MODEL TO ONE

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.908
WHERE REWARDS FOLLOW QUALITY

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:52.610
AND AUTHENTICITY OF CONTENT

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.245
PROMOTING CONNECTION AND PURE

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:55.479
SELF EXPRESSION RATHER THAN

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:57.314
CURATED FEEDS LIKES CLICKS AND

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.483
VIEWS IMAGINE THE EFFECT SUCH

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.951
A VIBRANT SPACES COULD HAVE ON

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.353
OUR COLLECTIVE MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.455
IN ORDER TO TRULY CONSIDER THE

00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:05.823
BEST INTERESTS OF YOUTH ONLINE

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.124
THEY NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.759
DESIGN OF THE PRODUCTS INTENDED

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:10.561
TO SERVE THEM MANY WILL TELL

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:11.662
YOU THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.330
THE SOCIAL AND MEDIA ENVIRONMENT

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:14.899
CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND THEY

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.500
WANT MORE SUPPORT FROM PARENTS

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:18.135
MENTORS AND POLICY MAKERS TO

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.937
PROTECT THEIR WELL BEING SO

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:20.871
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HEAR FROM

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.773
A FEW OF THEM TODAY AND VIA

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.174
VIDEO I'VE BROUGHT WITH ME THE

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:25.576
VOICES OF SEVERAL YOUNG PEOPLE

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.878
THAT I WORK WITH ON OUR GOOD

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:29.446
FOR MEDIA PROJECT IT'S A PEER

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:30.915
MENTORING PROGRAM WHERE YOUTH

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.549
SHARE THEIR HARD EARNED WISDOM

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:33.817
WITH YOUNGER TEENS AND TWEENS

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.052
TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE A MORE

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:37.321
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE ON SOCIAL

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:39.290
MEDIA THE PROJECT CHALLENGES

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.591
THEM TO REFLECT ON QUESTIONS

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:41.926
SUCH AS WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.193
GIVE YOUR YOUNGER SELF BEFORE

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.862
GETTING YOUR FIRST PHONE WHAT

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.330
STRATEGIES DO YOU USE ONLINE

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:47.731
TO PROTECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.800
AND RELEVANT TODAY IF YOU COULD

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:51.568
ADVISE POLICY MAKERS WHAT WOULD

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:53.570
YOU LIKE TO SEE CHANGE HERE'S

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:54.605
WHAT SOME OF THEM HAD TO SAY

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.297
BUYS LAWMAKERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.399
APPS TO CHANGE ONE THING I'D ASK

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:24.101
THEM TO EVOLVE THEIR TECHNOLOGY

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:26.403
TO BEING MORE WELL ROUNDED FOR

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.105
EXAMPLE SERVING MORE POINTS OF

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:29.974
VIEWS -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.742
A LOT OF THE TIME PEOPLE FALL

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:32.843
UNDER RABBIT HOLES OF SEEING

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.478
THE SAME PERSPECTIVES AND SAME

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:35.946
POSTS AND THINGS ON SOCIAL

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:37.915
MEDIA AND THAT MICROTARGETING

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.650
OF CONTENT REALLY AFFECTS YOUR

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:41.285
SELF PERCEPTIONS AND PERSONAL

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:42.419
PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS OTHER

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.221
PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT A LOT

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:45.823
OF TIME THIS LEADS TO FORCED

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:48.058
IDEAS AND THOUGHTS AND I THINK

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.326
THAT THE LACK OF THE DIFFERENT

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:51.662
PERSPECTIVES CAUSES PEOPLE

00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.297
TO COMPARE THEMSELVES TO WHAT

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:54.798
THEY SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.367
THESE IDEALIZED VERSIONS OF

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.868
WHAT THEY SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA

00:43:58.669 --> 00:43:59.837
AND I THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.405
BECOME CAUGHT UP IN THIS FALSE

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.874
NARRATIVE THEY GET OVERWHELMED

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:05.943
AND THIS CAUSES MENTAL ANXIETY

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.444
AND CAN LEAD TO POOR MENTAL

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:09.013
HEALTH COVERAGE TO ADVISE LAW

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.514
OR POLICY MAKERS ABOUT SOCIAL

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.082
MEDIA I THINK I WOULD DEFINITELY

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.083
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.352
THAT A LOT OF USERS ARE TWEENS

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:17.755
-- WHO OR TEENS WHO ARE JUST

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:20.190
UNDER OR AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:22.326
WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF WHEN YOU

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:23.794
CAN START DRAWING SOCIAL MEDIA

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:25.896
PLATFORMS AND WHILE THIS IS

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.398
KIND OF STATE IT AS THE NORM

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:28.599
IT'S NOT REALLY ENFORCED AND

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:30.434
SO -- I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.770
CONTENT -- CAN EASILY BE TO

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.905
MATURE I'M JUST FOR THAT AGE

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:37.408
-- SO I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:40.277
AWAY FOR USED TO BE ABLE TO

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.845
TURN OFF AND BLOCK AND REPORT

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:43.480
CONTENT THAT'S NOT AS QUITE

00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:45.783
AGE APPROPRIATE FOR THEM OR --

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.518
JUST A BETTER WAY TO REGULATE

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:49.353
YOU KNOW ON THE AGES OF THESE

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.522
USED FOR MYSELF SOMETIMES MAKE

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:54.091
PEOPLE MAKE ME FEEL INSPIRED OR

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.926
CREATIVE BUT AT OTHER TIMES IT

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.361
CAN MAKE ME FEEL REALLY JEALOUS

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:00.597
OR INSECURE ABOUT MYSELF AND

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:02.499
WHEN I'M EXPERIENCING THOSE SORT

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:04.401
OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS BECAUSE

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:05.769
OF SOCIAL MEDIA THAT'S WHEN I

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:08.072
KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.339
ADJUST MY FEET SO THAT'S NOT

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:10.641
HAPPENING ANYTHING IF I WERE TO

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:13.143
GIVE STATE POLICYMAKERS AND

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.479
ADULT ALISON VICE BUT HOW TO

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.481
MAKE SOCIAL MEDIA A BETTER SAFER

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.583
AND HEALTHIER PLEASE PLEASE I

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.617
THINK I WOULD SUM IT UP WITH

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:22.586
THE PHRASE STOP CENTERING

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:24.388
PROFIT INSERTS ENTERING YOU TO

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:26.657
CONSUMERS AND WHAT I MEAN BY

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.292
THAT IS THAT THE COMPANIES WHO

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:29.927
MAKE THESE ALGORITHMS TO CREATE

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.628
THESE APPS THEY DO SO WITH THE

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:33.497
PURPOSE OF MAKING MONEY AND

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.866
TURNING A PROFIT -- AND AS

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:37.568
A RESULT WHEN THEY RECOMMEND US

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:40.337
CONTENT NEWS INFORMATION AND

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.406
SO ON IT'S OFTEN WHAT GETS THE

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.408
MOST ENGAGEMENT -- WHAT'S GOOD

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:45.776
IF SOMEONE CLICKS WILL GETS THE

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:46.777
MOST LIKES WILL GET THE MOST

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:49.446
ABSENCE -- BUT THAT DOESN'T

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:50.681
ALWAYS MEAN THAT INFORMATION

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:52.749
WERE GIVEN OR RECOMMENDED IS

00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:55.452
CREDIBLE INFORMED WELL SOURCED

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:56.920
OR NEEDS ANY STANDARD TO BE

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.822
CONSIDERED AS ADVISING CALL C.

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.491
MAKERS ON WHAT TO DO IN REGARDS

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.326
TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS I

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:03.660
WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO ENSURE

00:46:03.727 --> 00:46:05.062
THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.430
ARE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.564
DATA THEY'RE COLLECTING FROM

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:09.633
YOU AS WELL AS HOW IT'S USED

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.435
FOR EXAMPLE THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:12.569
TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE

00:46:12.636 --> 00:46:14.071
MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY AND

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.206
UNDERSTANDABLE ADDITIONALLY

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.207
THEY SHOULD HAVE OBVIOUS

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.675
WAYS THAT YOU CAN PREVENT OR

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:21.178
LIMIT DATA COLLECTION IDEALLY

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:22.713
THESE DATA COLLECTION LIMITING

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:24.548
OPTIONS WOULD BE LOCKED OUT SO

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.016
THE DATA IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.584
COLLECTED AT ALL IF I COULD

00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:28.886
TALK TO POLICYMAKERS ABOUT

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.654
SOCIAL MEDIA I WOULD ADVISE

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.055
THEM TO CHANGE RULES REGARDING

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.524
HOW SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS CAN

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.925
IMPLEMENT ALGORITHMS ON KIDS

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:36.693
ACCOUNTS OTHER THAN THIS MAKE

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.895
IT SO THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAN

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:39.263
BECOME A HUGE TIME SUCK FOR

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:40.998
KIDS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:42.533
TO THE TOOLS OR GUIDANCE TO

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:43.567
HELP THEM NAVIGATE SOCIAL

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:45.302
MEDIA AND SAFE AND HEALTHY WAY

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:48.005
I'LL MAKE IT EASY FOR KIDS TO

00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.840
BECOME CONSUMED BY SOCIAL MEDIA

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:52.142
I THINK I COULD HAVE THE OPTION

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.944
TO TURN OFF THE ALGORITHM THAT

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:55.312
PROVIDES THEM WITH PERSONALIZED

00:46:55.379 --> 00:46:57.214
CONTENT SO THEY CAN SET

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:58.882
BOUNDARIES AND TAKE BACK CONTROL

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.450
WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:06.623
THANK YOU YOU'LL NOTICE NONE

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.558
OF THESE REMARKABLE YOUNG

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:08.859
LEADERS SAID THAT THEY WANT

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:10.060
TO ELIMINATE SOCIAL MEDIA FROM

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:11.061
THEIR LIVES THEY JUST WANT

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.629
TO MAKE IT BETTER AND THEY

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:14.698
HAVE GREAT IDEAS LISTENING TO

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:16.133
THEIR STATEMENTS WE HEAR THESE

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.302
CONSISTENT TEAMS MORE CONTROL

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:20.204
PERSONAL CHOICE AGENCY TO MAKE

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.405
THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:22.839
THEY READ SEE AND INTERACT

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.575
WITH ONLINE NOT HAVING THEIR

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:25.943
EXPERIENCE MANIPULATED BASED

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.377
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S IDEA OF WHAT

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.512
THEY THINK THEY SHOULD OR WANT

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.380
TO SEE HELPING THEM TO BE MORE

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:31.748
CRITICAL AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.083
WHAT CONTENT THEY'RE INGESTING

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.351
AND WHAT IMPACT IT HAS ON THEIR

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:36.153
MOOD OR THEIR FEELINGS HELP

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.588
UNDERSTANDING HOW THEIR PERSONAL

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.089
DATA IS BEING USED AND GIVING

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:40.657
THEM THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:43.193
SUCH USE A DISS I DESIRE

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.561
FOR DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:46.129
AND CONTENT PEOPLE BEING REAL

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.664
AUTHENTIC NOT PERFORMATIVE

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.366
PERFECTED VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.767
THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO RELATE

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:53.170
TO OR LIVE UP TO CONSIDERATION

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:54.638
FOR THE ENORMOUS AGE SPAN OF

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.139
PEOPLE MIXING WITH AN ONLINE

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:57.808
SPACES AND DOING A BETTER JOB OF

00:47:57.874 --> 00:47:59.309
PROTECTING THOSE WHO ARE YOUNGER

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:01.245
AND DON'T YET HAVE THE SKILLS OR

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:02.646
LIFE EXPERIENCE TO MAKE HEALTHY

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:05.115
CHOICES OR MINIMIZE HARMS WE

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.350
SIT AT AN INFLECTION POINT

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:07.451
WHERE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING

00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:09.019
OF THE NEXT GENERATION RELIES

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:10.420
ON ADOPTION OF A NEW DESIGN

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:12.456
PARADIGM THAT PLACES A PREMIUM

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:13.724
ON A WELLBEING SAFETY AND

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.325
PRIVACY ABOVE OTHER INTERESTS

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:16.960
YET STILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:18.729
DRIVE INNOVATION AND COMPETITION

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.497
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:21.832
BEYOND THE QUESTION OF HOW IS

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:22.966
SOCIAL MEDIA HARMING OUR YOUNG

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:25.469

A NEW SET OF EXPECTATIONS AND

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.014
STANDARDS THE PRIORITIZE THE

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.282
WELL BEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:39.850

TODAY BUT THE CHAIRS AND THE

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:27.497
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE --

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:28.932
THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.000
YES I AM A DEVELOPMENTAL

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:32.269
BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICIAN -- I MY

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:34.071
N. H. FUNDED RESEARCH FOCUSES

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:35.939
ON ALL OF THIS -- MODERN DIGITAL

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.307
MEDIA PARENTING AND CHILDREN'S

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:38.809
SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.044
MY TESTIMONY TODAY -- REPRESENTS

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:42.813
MY EXPERTISE IS A PEDIATRICIAN

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.648
AND RESEARCHER -- NOT THE VIEWS

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.849
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.485
SO WITH TODAY'S TESTIMONY I

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:49.953
HOPE TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.421
DEVELOPMENTAL AND EMOTIONAL

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.490
NEEDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN SO BIRTH

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.492
TO FIVE YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.160
SUFFICIENTLY CONSIDERED IN THE

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.495
DESIGN OF THE CURRENT DIGITAL

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.797
ECOSYSTEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME

00:50:00.864 --> 00:50:02.766
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE GREAT

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:05.035
OPPORTUNITY CALIFORNIA HAS FOR

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:07.104
IMPROVING EARLY CHILDHOOD AND

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.572
ALL CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH ON A

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:11.141
POPULATION SCALE BY MAKING CHILD

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:13.410
CENTERED DIGITAL DESIGN THE NORM

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:16.380
SO I KNOW THAT THE TOPIC OF

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.414
YOUNG CHILDREN AND DIGITAL

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:19.182
MEDIA CAN BE CONTENTIOUS I WAS

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:20.751
THE LEAD AUTHOR OF THE TWENTY

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:22.185
SIXTEEN AMERICAN ACADEMY OF

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:24.020
PEDIATRICS MEDIA GUIDELINES

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:25.222
OFTEN KNOWN AS THE SCREEN TIME

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.590
GUIDELINES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:29.192
SO I EXPERIENCED HOW THE PUBLIC

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:31.528
OFTEN RESPONSE TO THIS TOPIC

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:33.096
WITH PANICKED AND POLARIZED

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:35.499
DEBATES HOWEVER CARING ABOUT

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:36.767
CHILDREN'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.502
DIGITAL MEDIA SHOULDN'T BE A

00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:40.036
SENTIMENTAL OR EMOTIONAL ISSUE

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:41.371
IT'S HIGHLY PRACTICAL AND IT'S

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:43.640
GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH IN MEDICINE

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.308
WE'VE REALIZED THE IMMENSE POWER

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:46.877
OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:49.012
THE STRUCTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.947
CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT SHAPE

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:53.016
PATIENTS OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.252
TOM FRIEDEN THE FORMER DIRECTOR

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:56.386
OF THE CENTER FOR DISEASE

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:58.522
CONTROL AND ESTABLISH THE IDEA

00:50:58.588 --> 00:51:00.023
THAT YOU CAN MAKE MUCH MORE OF

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.758
A HEALTH IMPACT BY ADDRESSING

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:03.693
THE ENVIRONMENT MAKING PEOPLE'S

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.262
DEFAULT DECISIONS HEALTHY

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:06.930
RATHER THAN TRYING TO INTERVENE

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:08.698
PATIENT BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENT

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:10.567
SO WE OFTEN THINK OF CHILDREN'S

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:11.735
HOUSING ENVIRONMENTS IN THEIR

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:12.869
FOOD ENVIRONMENTS BUT WE SHOULD

00:51:12.936 --> 00:51:13.703
ALSO BE THINKING UP THEIR

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.305
DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS NOT JUST

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:16.473
EVERYTHING ON AN INDIVIDUAL

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.341
SCALE BECAUSE DIGITAL MEDIA

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:19.910
ARE SOME OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:21.778
AND UBIQUITOUS EXPOSURES THAT

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:23.213
CHILDREN EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.382
BASIS AND ARE OFTEN DESIGNED

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:26.817
BY ADULTS UNTRAINED IN THE

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:28.752
CURIOUS AND EXPANSIVE WAYS THAT

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:30.220
CHILDREN EXPERIENCE THE WORLD

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:32.322
SO CONSEQUENTLY DIGITAL DESIGN

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:34.291
OFTEN FOCUSES ON MONETIZATION OR

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:35.725
ENGAGEMENT METRICS AND MAY NOT

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.727
CONSIDER THE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:39.629
CONSEQUENCES ON CHILD USERS

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:41.231
HOWEVER THIS ALSO MEANS THAT

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.366
UPDATING THIS RELATIVELY NASCENT

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:44.901
DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM TO BE MORE

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.603
CHILD CENTERED MAY HAVE MORE OF

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.305
AN IMPACT ON CHILD WELL BEING

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:49.806
THAN ASKING EACH INDIVIDUAL

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:50.941
FAMILY TO CHANGE THEIR

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:53.310
BEHAVIORS SO THEREFORE I BUILT

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.444
MY RESEARCH PROGRAM AT THE

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:56.480
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AROUND

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.582
FOCUSING ON MISMATCHES BETWEEN

00:51:58.648 --> 00:51:59.850
HOW THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT IS

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:02.319
DESIGNED AND CHILDREN'S UNIQUE

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:03.353
DEVELOPMENTAL AND EMOTIONAL

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.321
NEEDS SOMETHING TO REVIEW A

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:06.022
FEW OF THOSE EXAMPLES TODAY

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:09.326
SO FIRST EARLY CHARACTER BROOCH

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:10.927
CAREGIVER CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.462
ARE THE BEDROCK OF LIFELONG

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.364
MENTAL HEALTH IT ARE FREQUENTLY

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:15.866
INTERRUPTED AND DISPLACED BY

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:17.267
TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:18.502
THAT ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.637
POST AND REACT AND CONSUME AND

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:22.873
LESS AMOUNTS OF CONTENT OUR

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:24.174
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN PARENTS

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:25.642
ATTENTION AS HEAVILY ABSORBED

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.010
IN THEIR MOBILE DEVICES THERE'S

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:28.445
LESS VERBAL AND NONVERBAL

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.080
INTERACTION WITH YOUNG CHILDREN

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:31.982
LESS INSIGHT INTO THE MEANING

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:33.984
OF CHILD BEHAVIOR AND OVER TIME

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.552
A WORSENING OF CHILD BEHAVIOR

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.354
OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.089
THAT THESE INTERRUPTIONS REDUCE

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:40.090
CHILDREN'S LEARNING FROM THEIR

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.858
PARENTS AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.493
PARENTS TO KNOW HOW TO REPAIR

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.761
WITH THEIR CHILDREN AFTER A

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:46.830
TOUGH MOMENT SO THIS POINT IS

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.098
IMPORTANT WE DON'T NEED TO BE

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:49.432
PERFECT PARENTS ONE HUNDRED

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:50.767
PERCENT RESPONSIVE TO ALL

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.769
OUR CHILDREN ALL DAY LONG BUT

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.170
DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE SHOWS THAT

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:55.972
WHEN CHILDREN AND PARENTS CAN

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:58.241
REPAIR AFTER DIFFICULT MOMENTS

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:00.277
THIS LEADS TO SECURE ATTACHMENT

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:01.711
AND THIS MEANS A STRONGER SENSE

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:03.380
OF SELF AND EMOTION REGULATION

00:53:03.446 --> 00:53:05.882
FOR THE CHILD AND THE MISMATCH

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:07.250
HERE IS THAT SILICON VALLEY'S

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:08.919
DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS EMPHASIZE

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:10.453
PERSONALIZATION FOR A SINGLE

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.122
USER BUT THIS IS AT ODDS WITH

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.256
HOW CHILDREN EXPERIENCE THE

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.291
WORLD THROUGH THEIR FIRST

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.459
RELATIONSHIPS IT ALSO IGNORES

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:17.727
HOW HARD PARENTS ARE WORKING

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:19.229
RIGHT NOW TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:21.231
CHILD CUES AND BEHAVIORS AND

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.732
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING IN THERE

00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:24.601
TO ON IN THEIR CHILDREN'S MINDS

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:25.869
WHILE THEIR ATTENTION IS PULLED

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:27.170
IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:29.272
SO INSTEAD OF BLAMING PARENTS

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:30.473
ABOUT USING THEIR DEVICES IN

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.541
FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN MY

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:33.577
RESEARCH HAS ASKED WHY THEY DO

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.545
THIS AND PARENTS TELL US THAT

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:37.581
DEVICES HAVE A HAWK THEY ARE

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:39.149
COGNITIVELY AND EMOTIONALLY

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.550
OVERLOADED FROM THE DEVICES

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:42.152
IN THEIR LAPS OR THEIR POCKETS

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:44.154
AND THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL MEDIA

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.622
AS A SOURCE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.724
BUT ALSO A LOT OF TOXIC CONTENT

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:48.758
THAT THEY NEED TO WADE THROUGH

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.427
SO VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:51.895
ADOLESCENTS HAVE SAID IN THOSE

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.530
VIDEOS THEY WANT THE SAME SORT

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:55.398
OF CONTROL AN AGENCY OVER THEIR

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:57.367
FEEDS AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.102
TO DISCUSS PARENTS MEDIA USE BUT

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.737
I THINK THIS POINT ILLUSTRATES

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.938
HOW DIGITAL DESIGN HAS

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.940
LARGELY IGNORED HER CHILDREN'S

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:05.575
EXPERIENCES ARE INSEPARABLE

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:07.577
FROM THEIR RELATIONAL CONTEXTS

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:11.014
SO SECOND IN EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.282
LEARNING HOW TO IDENTIFY AND

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:13.683
MANAGE EMOTIONS IS ANOTHER

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.251
FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:16.920
BUT YOU BAKER JUST DESIGN AND

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:18.788
FRICTIONLESS ACCESS TO MYRIAD

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:20.290
CONTENT MEANS THAT CHILDREN CAN

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:22.492
POTENTIALLY USE GAMES AND VIDEOS

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:24.828
AT ANY TIME OF DAY OR ANY MOMENT

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:26.963
OF BOREDOM THE DIFFICULT THING

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.365
ABOUT RAISING YOUNG CHILDREN IS

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:29.733
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY FULL OF A LOT

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.601
OF FRICTION A LOT OF NEGATIVE

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.236
BEHAVIORS AND PARENT SELF DOUBT

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:35.038
AS CHILDREN LEARN HOW TO INHIBIT

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.140
THEIR IMPULSES IDENTIFY HOW

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.074
THEIR BRAIN AND BODY YOU'RE

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:39.509
FEELING AND HOW TO MANAGE THAT

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.811
FRUSTRATION THIS IS ONE CRITICAL

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.213
EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING SKILLS

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:44.514
ARE DEVELOPING WHICH HAPPENED TO

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.549
PLAY AND SENSITIVE INTERACTIONS

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:48.318
WITH CAREGIVERS AND CHILDREN

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:49.753
BEING GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO

00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:52.088
EXPLORE AND FAIL AND REPAIR

00:54:52.155 --> 00:54:53.590
WITHOUT TECHNOLOGIES DEMANDING

00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:55.692
THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION OUR

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.495
RESEARCH STUDYING THE TOP APPS

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.664
LABELED AS EDUCATIONAL SHOWS

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.298
THAT THE MAJORITY ACTUALLY

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:04.634
PROVIDE LOW QUALITY SIMPLISTIC

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:06.102
AND REPETITIVE GAMEPLAY AND

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:07.337
ARE FULL OF DISTRACTIONS SUCH

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:09.272
AS ADS OR VIRTUAL REWARDS

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:11.841
WHAT ALSO CONCERNS EARLY

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.043
CHILDHOOD SPECIALISES HOW

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:14.577
DEPENDENT SOME CHILDREN HAVE

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:15.912
BECOME ON USING MEDIA AS A

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.547
COMMON TOOL PARTICULARLY THOSE

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:19.449
WITH SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DELAYS

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:21.985
MY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:23.720
EXCESSIVE USE OF MEDIA FOR

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:24.888
CALMING IS LINKED WITH MORE

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.189
EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY OVER

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:27.991
TIME A SIGN THAT CHILDREN

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:28.958
ARE NOT LEARNING THEIR OWN

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.493
INTERNAL MECHANISMS OF MANAGING

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.429
STRONG EMOTIONS AND RECENT

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.663
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THIS MAY

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.331
ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PROBLEMATIC

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:36.633
MEDIA USE HABITS IN EARLY

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.901
CHILDHOOD SUCH AS RELYING

00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:39.669
ON MEDIA FOR COPING THAT WE

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.037
THINK MAY CARRY FORWARD INTO

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:43.006
THE TWEEN AND TEEN YEARS

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:46.309
AND THIS WOULD NOT BE IS

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:47.577
CONCERNING OF CHILDREN WERE

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.312
REGULARLY ACCESSING POSITIVE

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:50.613
PROGRAMS LIKE DANIEL TIGER'S

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.915
NEIGHBORHOOD OR SESAME STREET

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:52.949
EVERY TIME THEY PICKED UP THEIR

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.818
MOBILE DEVICE BUT OUR RESEARCH

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:56.286
TRACKING CHILDREN'S TABLETS

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:57.587
AND SMARTPHONES SHOWS THAT

00:55:57.954 --> 00:55:59.456
THE FRICTIONLESS APP STORES

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.157
HAVE PROVIDED ACCESS TO A WIDE

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:02.659
RANGE OF AGE INAPPROPRIATE

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:05.061
CONTENT WHEN REVIEWING THE APPS

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:06.162
THAT THREE TO FOUR YEAR OLD

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:07.363
CHILDREN IN OUR STUDIES HAVE

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.165
USED WE HAVE FOUND APPS WITH

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:11.000
NAMES LIKE TERRORIST SHOOTER

00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:13.436
THREE D. FLIPPY KNIFE KICK THE

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:15.238
BUDDY HEAD AND HORROR APPS LIKE

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.974
GRANNY SO EVEN WHEN CHILDREN

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.442
ARE PLAYING AGE AN APPROACH

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:21.945
AGE APPROPRIATE GAMES ADDS THAT

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:23.546
COME THROUGH AD NETWORKS CAN

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:25.048
HAVE VIOLENT OR INAPPROPRIATE

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:27.717
CONTENT APPLE MARKET PLACES AN

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:29.152
AD NETWORKS CONTINUE TO BE A

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.720
PART OF THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.055
THAT HAVE NOT FULLY GRASP

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:33.590
CHILDREN'S NEEDS DESPITE BEING

00:56:33.656 --> 00:56:35.158
A FREQUENT ENTRY POINT FOR

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:37.093
CHILDREN'S ONLINE EXPERIENCES

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.162
SO THIS LEADS ME TO MY THIRD

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.530
MISMATCH WHICH IS HOW HEAVILY

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:42.098
MONETIZED CHILDREN'S DIGITAL

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:44.100
SPACES ARE DESPITE CHILDREN NOT

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:45.602
FULLY UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS

00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:47.570
LIKE ADVERTISING OR THE VALUE

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:49.806
OF CURRENCY OR PERSUASIVE NUDGES

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.909
SO BY TRACKING YOUNG CHILDREN'S

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:54.410
MOBILE DEVICES MY RESEARCH TEAM

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:55.979
REALIZE HOW MUCH TIME CHILDREN

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.380
ARE SPENDING ON PLATFORMS

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.948
NOT INITIALLY DESIGNED WITH

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.717
CHILDREN IN MIND SUCH AS YOU TO

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:02.852
-- NERD WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:04.420
TO ANALYZE CHILDREN'S YOUTUBE

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:06.389
VIEWING HISTORIES FINDING THEM

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:07.857
THAT THE MAJORITY OF VIDEOS

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:08.858
YOUNG CHILDREN ARE WATCHING

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.827
ARE NOT EDUCATIONAL ARE HIGHLY

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.328
COMMERCIALIZED AND MANY CONTAIN

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:14.264
VIOLENT OR STEREO TYPES CONTENT

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.466
ON SOME CHANNELS WE EXAMINED

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:18.234
DURATION OF ADS EXCEEDED THE

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:20.436
DURATION OF THE VIDEOS SO

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:21.838
ALTHOUGH POSITIVE CONTENT

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:23.506
EXISTS ON LIKE ON YOUTUBE LIKE

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.241
CROCHETING CHILDREN APPEAR TO

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:27.310
BE WATCHING WHAT TRENDS AND

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:29.245
ALGORITHMS THAT ELEVATE THE JUNK

00:57:29.445 --> 00:57:31.114
UNFORTUNATELY LEAD TO CONTENT

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.515
CREATORS TRYING TO PRODUCE

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:33.950
MORE OUTRAGEOUS CONTENT TO

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:35.685
GET MORE CLICKS AND ENGAGEMENT

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.755
IN MOBILE APPS MY RESEARCH IS

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.256
FOCUSED ON WHERE DIGITAL DESIGN

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:41.858
IS CROSSING THE LINE IN TERMS

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:43.960
OF MANIPULATING CHILDREN ALSO

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:45.528
KNOWN AS DARK PATTERNS INTO

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.096
WATCHING MORE ADS PLAYING FOR

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:48.932
LONGER MAKING MORE PURCHASES

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:50.500
IN OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:52.202
APPS THAT WE DOWNLOADED PLAYED

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:53.803
EIGHTY PERCENT CONTAINED AT

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.271
LEAST ONE TYPE OF MANIPULATIVE

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:56.940
DARK PATTERN THIS COMES IN

00:57:57.006 --> 00:57:58.074
THE FORM OF PRESSURE FROM

00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:00.243
TRUSTED CHARACTERS NAVIGATION

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.511
CONSTRAINTS THAT MAKE KIDS

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.613
KEEP PLAYING FABRICATED TIME

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.582
PRESSURE PROMISES OF VIRTUAL

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:06.616
CURRENCIES ARE GAME PLAY

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.418
OBJECTS OR REWARDS FOR WATCHING

00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:10.820
ADS WE'RE FINDING THAT ADULTS

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.222
DESIGN NORMS ARE JUST COPIED

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:13.923
AND PASTED SLOPPILY INTO

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.625
CHILDREN'S DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.727
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOOD DESIGN

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:20.830
IN ADDITION WE FOUND

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:21.965
THAT CHILDREN FROM LOWER

00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:23.399
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ARE

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:24.901
MORE LIKELY TO PLAY APPS WITH

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.336
MANIPULATIVE DARK PATTERNS

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:27.704
THEY'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:28.705
WATCH YOUTUBE AND MUCH OF

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:30.373
FOR LONGER WHICH SUGGESTS THE

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.908
CHILDREN'S DIGITAL OPPORTUNITIES

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:33.509
ARE BEING SHAPED BY WHAT IS

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:35.044
EASILY AVAILABLE AND WHAT IS

00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:37.046
FREE THE DEFAULT CONDITIONS

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:38.481
THE DOCTOR FRIEDMAN HAS TALKED

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:40.817
ABOUT ALTHOUGH MY LAB IS

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.585
DOCUMENTED THE PREDOMINANCE OF

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.087
INAPPROPRIATE DESIGN FEATURES

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:45.288
AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS IT'S

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:46.623
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:49.125
FOUND MANY CHILD CENTERED --

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:51.060
INDUSTRIES THAT STAND OUT AND

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.362
IT'S A RELIEF ON MY RESEARCH

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:53.663
ASSISTANTS PLAY SOMETHING LIKE

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:55.665
PBS KIDS OR KHAN ACADEMY --

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.934
TOCA BOCA OR LET GO BECAUSE

00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:59.335
THEY DON'T COLLECT DATA THAT

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:01.237
THEY DON'T SERVE ADS THEY

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:03.039
HAVE MEANINGFUL CONTENT THEY

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:04.540
HAVE STOPPAGE CUES TO LET KIDS

00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:07.243
DISENGAGE AND GO NUDGED THEM TO

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.145
PLAY IN THE THREE D. PHYSICAL

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:11.414
OR SOCIAL WORLDS THEY GIVE

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:12.949
KIDS THE AGENCY AND AUTONOMY

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.417
TO CHOOSE WHAT TO DO NEXT AND

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:16.052
THEY REGULARLY EVALUATE THEIR

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:18.121
PRODUCTS TO EACH QUESTION

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:19.188
ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:20.857
MADE AT THE DESIGN OUTSET

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.325
WE NEED MORE COMPANIES THAT

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.726
SHOW A DUTY OF CARE THAT THEY

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.461
UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:26.930
INHERENT IN CREATING THE IMAGES

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:28.031
AND STORIES THAT CHILDREN

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:30.700
CONSUME I ALSO WANT TO NOTE

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:32.101
THAT REGULATION THROUGH THE

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:33.269
AGE APPROPRIATE DESIGN CODE

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:35.738
IN THE U. K. DID NOT KILL

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:36.940
THE TECH INDUSTRY BUT ACTUALLY

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.574
ALLOWED A LOT OF CHILD CENTERED

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.743
IDEAS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.712
PLANNING STAGES WITH CHILD TEAMS

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.047
AT GOOGLE OR MATTER OR OTHER

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.848
LARGE COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.417
COME TO FRUITION AND FINALLY

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:49.552
BE PRIORITIZED IN THE MONTHS

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:51.621
LEADING UP TO THE SEPTEMBER

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.456
DEADLINE WHEN THE ADC WENT

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.658
INTO EFFECT INSTAGRAM FINALLY

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.193
MADE TEENS ACCOUNTS PRIVATE BY

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.362
DEFAULT YOUTUBE FINALLY MADE

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.164
NIGHT TIME NOTIFICATIONS OFF

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.299
BY DEFAULT THESE ARE BASIC

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:04.167
IMPROVEMENTS THAT SHOULD

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.835
HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO BUT

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:06.936
THERE CLEAR SIGNS THAT THESE

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.538
CHANGES ARE FEASIBLE AND

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:09.405
THERE'S STILL SO MANY OTHER

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:11.474
INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT INDUSTRY

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.842
CAN DESIGN FOR KIDS AND STILL

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:15.078
MAKE PROFITS AND SUMMARY I

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.479
URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:17.847
THIS IS A RELATIVELY NASCENT

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.682
INDUSTRY CREATING A RAPIDLY

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.184
CHANGING DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:22.952
AND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.787
TO DEBUG WHAT HAS BEEN HASTILY

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.522
CREATED AND REDESIGN IT IN A

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:27.790
MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.926
CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS THANK

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.796
THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:34.831
THE TESTIMONY FROM BOTH YOUR

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:35.999
NOW WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.166
THE COMMITTEE AND OPEN IT UP TO

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:39.235
-- ANY QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.236
FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.644
GARCIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.013
TESTIMONY SO WANTED TO GO

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:52.015
BACK TO THE CHILD CENTERED

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:54.984
-- IDEA YOU TALK TO ABOUT

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.720
SITES LIKE PBS KIDS THE KHAN

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:00.390
ACADEMY AND I'VE I HAVE

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.291
VISITED THOSE SITES AND A FEW

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:03.092
OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.628
THAT ARE CHILD CENTERED --

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.364
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.366
PEPPERMINT DIRECTIONAL LIKE

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.035
OUR KIDS ARE IN TECH TALKS

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.370
BASED FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM --

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.373
DISCORD I JUST RECENTLY

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.175
DISCOVERED THAT WE ARE IN

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:21.577
SO WHAT WOULD BE FROM CHILD

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:24.080
CENTERED -- IDEAS THAT THESE

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:25.748
OTHER PLATFORMS CAN BE USING

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.318
SO I THINK FIRST OF

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:30.787
ALL THERE'S NOT A SOCIAL

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.221
COMPONENT TO A LOT OF THOSE

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:33.856
APPS THEY'RE REALLY MEANT TO

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.591
JUST ENGAGE THE USER AND MAYBE

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:38.027
THAT THE CHILD'S PARENTS --

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:39.896
IF YOU WERE ADDING A SOCIAL

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.230
COMPONENT I THINK THERE NEED

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:42.832
TO BE DESIGNED FROM THE GROUND

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.667
UP ENGAGING FAMILIES WITH

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.869
CHILDREN NOT JUST RETROFITTING

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:48.471
EXISTING APPS LIKE TICK TOCK

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.739
OR DOING OTHER THINGS THAT

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.674
JUST CREATE YOU KNOW FILTERS

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.409
OR NEW PRIVACY SETTINGS I THINK

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:54.677
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:55.778
CHILD CENTERED DESIGN IS YOU'RE

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.180
REALLY WORKING WITH FAMILIES

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.714
SEEING HOW CHILDREN EXPERIENCE

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.183
THESE PRODUCTS TESTING THEM

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:01.784
OUT AND THEN CONTINUING TO DO

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.553
ONGOING AUDITS ARE TESTING TO

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:05.154
MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE USING

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.789
THEM IN THE WAYS YOU ANTICIPATED

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.491
THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES SAY

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.226
LIKE LEGO HAS LIKE A LIFE WHICH

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.761
IS A SOCIAL PLATFORM FOR KIDS

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:13.062
WHERE THEY JUST DON'T SHOW THEIR

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.430
FACES THEY DON'T USE THEIR REAL

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.532
NAMES BUT THEY CAN SHARE WHAT

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:17.967
THEY'VE DONE IN TERMS OF LIKE

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.936
-- BUILDS AND THEY CAN YOU KNOW

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.671
COMMENTS -- YOU KNOW AND THERE'S

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:23.005
CERTAIN PROTECTIONS JUST SO THAT

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.674
THEY'RE NOT REALLY COMMENTING IN

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.742
NEGATIVE WAYS BUT IT'S MORE AGE

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.344
APPROPRIATE IN THAT KIDS DON'T

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.680
NEED THEIR IMAGE -- TO

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.315
BE THE CENTER OF THE ATTENTION

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.616
HERE THEIR CREATIVITY SHOULD BE

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.817
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION AND I

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.419
THINK THAT EACH PRODUCT WOULD

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.920
PROBABLY NEED TO THINK THAT WAY

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:40.256
OF HOW DO WE UP LEFT THE MOST

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:41.491
IMPORTANT THING FOR CHILDREN

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:43.126
RIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IT BEING

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.293
ABOUT WHAT A LOT OF THE SOCIAL

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.862
PLATFORMS ARE ABOUT WITCHES

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:48.764
APPEARANCE OR PERFORMANCE OR

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:49.999
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF METRICS

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.601
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE APPROVED OF

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.069
WHAT YOU JUST DID YOU KNOW MANY

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:54.670
OF THESE THESE SATIN PLATFORMS

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.472
MAY NOT HAVE LAKES OR OTHER

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.107
METRICS OF ENGAGEMENT AT ALL

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.143
SO SHOULD WE BE RAISING THE AGE

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:01.878
LIMIT FOR THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.212
RIGHT NOW SOME OF THEM HAVE AT

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.249
THIRTEEN -- I APPRECIATE THIS

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.652
OR VETS -- COMMENT

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:10.887
ABOUT HER KIDS NOT BEING ON THE

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:14.157
PLATFORM -- AND AND VISUALLY

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.458
BE RAISING THAT AGE LIMIT THEN

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.692
THE SORT OF RECOMMENDATION

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:20.496
YEAH I MEAN I WOULD ANSWER THAT

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.131
BY LIKE CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.533
IT'S SORT OF ALL OR NOTHING

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.234
LIKE IT'S EITHER YOUR HONOR

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.170
YOUR OFF AND THERE'S ONLY ONE

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.038
ONLINE WORLD THAT THAT'S FOR

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.806
ADULTS FOR KIDS FOR EVERYBODY

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.842
SO I THINK CREATING SPACES THAT

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.343
ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.612
SO THAT IT CAN BE A SAFE AREA

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:38.681
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO PLAY AND

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.650
SOCIALIZE AN EXPERIMENT I THINK

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:41.851
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.486
BECAUSE -- THAT'S WHAT WE DO

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:44.921
IN THE OFFLINE WORLD RIGHT

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.088
WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.457
ENGAGING IN SAFER ENVIRONMENTS

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:49.458
AND WE DON'T JUST THROW THEM

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.894
IN WITH EVERYBODY -- SO

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:52.795
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WOULD

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:53.963
RECOMMEND IS DOING SOME MORE

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.064
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.933
SPACES SO THEY HAVE MORE CHOICES

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:58.801
YEAH I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:00.570
A COMBINATION OF ADJUSTING THE

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:03.039
EXISTING SPACES THAT TEENAGERS

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.540
ARE USING THERE'S A STUDY

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.142
THAT JUST CAME OUT YESTERDAY

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.443
IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.644
TELLING THAT THERE ARE THESE

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.246
DEVELOPMENTALLY SENSITIVE

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.480
WINDOWS IN THE ADOLESCENT

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.516
YEARS WHEN GIRLS MIGHT STRUGGLE

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:14.850
MORE WITH IT DURING THAT KIND

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:16.252
OF ELEVEN TO FOURTEEN AGE

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:18.321
RANGE AND BOYS MORE LATER IN

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:21.224
ADOLESCENCE SO -- THERE MAY

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:23.893
NEED TO BE BOTH -- IMPROVEMENTS

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.194
IN THE DESIGN OF THE EXISTING

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.829
PLATFORMS I KNOW THAT THEY

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.698
HAVE CHILD TEAMS WORKING ON

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.567
WAYS TO TRY TO MAKE IT A GRADED

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.003
-- AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.671
APPROPRIATE CONTENT RATHER

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:37.340
THAN AN ALL OR NOTHING ENTRY

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.242
INTO YOU KNOW THE ADULT

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:40.443
SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD RIGHT AT

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.345
THE AGE OF THIRTEEN WHICH

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.714
IS -- RIGHT NOW A LOT OF

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.748
RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:46.983
THAT'S MORE THAN CHILDREN

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.851
ONCE AT THAT AGE AND IT'S

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:50.286
MORE THAN IS DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:51.921
SAFE OR APPROPRIATE FOR THEM

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:56.892
I APPRECIATE -- FRAMING IT IN

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:59.562
TERMS OF ADJUSTING WHAT EXISTS

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.130
THE CREATING OF A PLATFORM

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.298
THAT IS CHILD CENTRED FROM THE

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.133
VERY BEGINNING INSIDE I WILL

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.102
SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT A NEW

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.937
MINDSET THAT YOU PUT IN MY HEAD

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.405
MY APPROACH HAS BEEN FOCUSING

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:10.806
ON THE ADJUSTMENT OF EXISTING

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.509
PLATFORMS -- VERSUS HAVING

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.111
THE DUAL TANDEM FACT THAT YOU

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:17.513
JUST SPOKE TO US ABOUT IT

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.081
IN IN THAT ADJUSTMENT OF OF THIS

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.116
PART FOR MY HAVE BEEN WORRIED

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.384
ABOUT THE ADOLESCENTS AND THE

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.686
IMAGES ARE GETTING -- AND HOW

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.054
IT IS FEEDING THEIR EATING

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.256
DISORDERS -- ALONG THE WAY IN

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.058
THE MENTAL HEALTH ALONG THE WAY

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.861
-- AND TRYING TO ACTIONS PARENTS

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:33.262
YOU TO THOSE IMAGES OF IT S.

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:36.032
AS THE STARTING POINT OF FLOOR

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:38.401
FOR ADJUSTING THOSE PREFERENCE

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:39.235
AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S YOUR

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:40.770
APPROPRIATE POLICY AND I DON'T

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:43.072
KNOW BUT TRYING TO FIND WAYS --

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.373
AND SO WHAT ARE SOME AMERICAN

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.574
RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.510
INSURANCE OF THE ADJUSTMENT SIDE

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.779
OF EXISTING SOCIAL PLATFORMS

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:53.015
-- WELL I THINK I MEAN YOU MIGHT

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.684
HEAR FROM A TECHNOLOGIST LATER

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.751
THAT WOULD HAVE MORE SPECIFIC

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:56.819
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I THINK

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.587
PART OF WHAT WHAT IT SPEAKS TO

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.756
IS JUST THE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:03.292
DRIVING CONTENT BECAUSE I THINK

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.027
THAT IF A YOUNG PERSON WHO'S

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:07.396
CURIOUS AND YOU KNOW EXPLORING

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:08.831
STUMBLES UPON TROUBLING

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:11.033
CONTENT AND INTERVIEWS THAT THE

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.201
ALGORITHMS GONNA THINK THEY WANT

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.136
TO SEE MORE OF THAT -- SO THAT

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.905
SOMETIMES HOW THEY GET TRAPPED

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.940
INTO THESE LOOPS OF CONTENT

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.942
THAT IS NOT HEALTHY -- AND SO

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:21.644
IF THERE'S MORE CONTROL OVER

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.279
YOU KNOW GOING WHERE YOU WANT

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:24.447
TO GO AND SEEING THINGS YOU

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.881
WANT TO SEE NOT WHAT'S BEING

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.551
FOR STATUTES THAT THAT IS

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:29.652
GOING TO ELIMINATE SOME OF

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.020
THE TROUBLING CONTENT THAT'S

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:32.288
THAT THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED TO

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.358
AND I CAN GIVE AN EXAMPLE FROM

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.093
-- YOUNGER IN CHILDHOOD WE'RE

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.862
EXAMINING THAT -- THE THUMBNAILS

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.230
THAT ARE OFFERED TO CHILDREN

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.531
AT THE END OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:44.133
TO LOOK AT WHAT IS RECOMMENDED

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.635
TO THE NEXT AND A LOT OF THOSE

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:49.271
IMAGES CONTAIN A LOT OF EITHER

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.806
VIOLENCE OR MANUFACTURED

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.275
DRAMA OR A LOT OF JUST VISUAL

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.611
OUTRAGEOUS NOUS -- SOME OF IT

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.180
SEXUALIZED SOME OF IT MORE --

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.583
IT JUST LAVISH AND FULL OF MONEY

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:01.951
AND AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.085
JUST REALLY TRYING TO LURE

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.788
CHILDREN TO CLICK THROUGH AND

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.423
SO CONTENT CREATORS ARE DOING

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.058
THAT BECAUSE THE ALGORITHM HAS

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:10.826
INCENTIVIZE THE MORE CLICKS

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:11.894
IN THE MORE ENGAGEMENT YOU

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:14.296
GET THE MORE AD REVENUE YOU'RE

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:15.431
GOING TO GET SO IF THEY COULD

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.266
CHANGE SOME OF THE INCENTIVES

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.735
AROUND PROFITS ON THESE SITES

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:21.337
IF THEY COULD CHANGE THE WAY

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.973
SOME OF THE -- SUGGESTIONS

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.207
FOR WHAT TO CLICK THROUGH NEXT

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.842
BECAUSE WHEN I'VE OPENED UP

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:28.144
SNAPCHAT OR OTHER THINGS I

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.613
SEE PLENTY OF FEMALE AND MALE

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:32.982
AND OTHER BODIES IN KERR IT AS

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:35.184
PART OF THAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.318
TO CLICK THROUGH AND SO IT'S

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.754
BECOME PART OF THE ENGAGEMENT

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.990
JURISTIC SAYS THAT THAT --

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.591
CONTENT CREATORS ARE USING TO

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:43.893
GET MORE ENGAGEMENT AND THAT

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.428
MAY BE WHY IT'S JUST BECOME SO

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:48.230
COMMON OUT FOR TEENS TO BE

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.732
GOING DOWN THOSE RABBIT HOLES

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:52.334
AND THEN FINALLY -- IF THERE'S

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:54.503
A WAY TO CHANGE THE ALGORITHM TO

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:57.440
ACTUALLY -- GET IT TO ELEVATE

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:00.776
MORE POSITIVE CONTENT CONTENT

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.044
THAT PERHAPS HAS BEEN REVIEWED

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:04.079
BY HUMANS AND KIND OF THAT

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:06.048
THERE ARE IS SOME AGREEMENT AND

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:07.416
DEVELOPMENTAL CONSENSUS LIKE

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.717
YES THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF THAT

AGES TO BE SEEING IT WOULD

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:13.656
BE FANTASTIC OF THAT SORT OF

01:08:13.722 --> 01:08:14.857
ELEVATION COULD BE HAPPENING

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.991
RATHER THAN THE ELEVATION

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.460
OF WHAT'S REALLY CLICK BAITY

OF THEIR SOCIO ECONOMIC

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.806
BACKGROUND I THINK ADULTS STILL

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.509
STRUGGLE WITH THAT SORT OF SELF

01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:14.743
REGULATION AND AND A LOT OF MY

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.478
RESEARCH FOCUSES ON PARENTS OWN

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.647
MEDIA USE AND SO IN OUR LATEST

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.082
STUDY WE'VE BEEN ASKING PARENTS

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:22.351
ARE WHAT ARE THE DIGITAL DESIGN

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.920
-- TECHNIQUES THAT ARE MOST

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.255
HELPFUL TO YOU IN SUPPORT OF

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.489
AND THEY MENTIONED THINGS LIKE

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:28.924
YOU KNOW WALMART AND TARGET

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.759
APPS THERE SO CONVENIENCE THEY

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.261
HELPED ME GET THROUGH SHOPPING

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:33.963
AND I CAN THEN GO ON AND LIVE

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:35.331
THE REST OF MY LIFE AS A PARENT

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:36.699
AND THEN WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:37.866
WHAT SORT OF DESIGN FEATURES

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.468
ARE UNHELPFUL THEY THEY'VE

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.270
UNIFORMLY TALKED ABOUT SOCIAL

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.405
MEDIA SITES OFTEN FACEBOOK AND

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:45.674
INSTAGRAM ABOUT HOW THEY GO

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.509
INTO THOSE PLATFORMS HOPING

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:49.645
FOR SOME TYPE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.347
SEEING THEIR FAMILY HAVING

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:52.948
A LAUGH OR AN ESCAPE FINDING

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.017
NEWS ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY BUT

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.485
THAT THEY'RE WAITING THROUGH

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:58.187
LOTS OF OTHER EITHER TARGETED

01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:00.122
ADS THAT THEY FIND CREEPY AND

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.557
SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PARENTS

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:03.225
THAT WE INTERVIEWED SAID THEY

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.627
DID NOT THINK THAT IT WAS

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:06.695
ETHICAL TO HAVE REALLY TARGETED

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.498
ADVERTISING OUT THEM -- AND THEN

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:11.634
THEY WANTED MORE CONTROL ONE

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.035
PARENT SAID I JUST WANT FACEBOOK

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.637
LITE I WANT THAT VERSION OF

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.138
IT WHERE I CAN JUST YOU KNOW

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.107
DO YOU SEE THE FAMILY THAT I

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.108
WANT TO SEE AND NOT HAVE TO

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.309
DEAL WITH ALL THE OTHER EITHER

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.211
POLITICAL STUFF OR MARKETING

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:23.779
STAFF OR OR OTHER THINGS

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:25.881
THAT ARE GETTING XCELERATED

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.851
BY THE DESIGN FEATURES SO --

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.420
THAT IS NOT A SPECIFIC AGE

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:32.988
BUT IT IS AN INDICATION THAT

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.790
I THINK ADULTS WOULD BENEFIT

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:37.226
FROM MORE CONTROL AND MORE

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:39.294
TRANSPARENCY FROM A LOT OF

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.163
THESE AD TECH PLATFORMS AS WELL

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.033
AND THE OTHER THING WHAT WHEN WE

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:45.300
ARE HAVING THIS PANEL THAT I WAS

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:47.503
THINKING ABOUT I WAS BORN IN THE

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:49.905
SEVENTIES AND A LOT OF THINGS

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.040
WE'RE DEALING WITH IS JUST ARE

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.374
JUST AMPLIFIED TO THE SOCIAL

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.043
MEDIA PLATFORM RIGHT WHERE MARIE

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.644
CLAIRE AND COSMETOLOGISTS HOW

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:56.912
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AS WOMEN I

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.047
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAN HAD THAT

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:59.848
THAT'S WHAT I HAD AND YOU KNOW

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:02.051
SO A LOT OF THAT BODY DYSMORPHIA

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.519
THAT WE HAVE THE WIND PHOTOSHOP

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.087
PHOTOS WE THOUGHT WE ALL HAD

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.388
TO LOOK LIKE KATE MOSS AND I

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.256
CAN TELL YOU I WAS NEVER GONNA

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:08.924
LOOK LIKE KATE MOSS YOU KNOW AND

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.559
SO HOW HOW THE AND THAT'S BEEN

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:12.561
AMPLIFIED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.430
AND THE FILTERS NOW AND AND HOW

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.597
PEOPLE REALLY RELATE TO THAT

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.800
AND I'M VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.201
AT THE TIME WHEN WE HAD PRINT

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:20.936
MEDIA WHICH IS OUR PRIMARY FOR

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.072
MEDIA OR TV WHERE HE WE HAD ADS

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:26.308
TARGETING KIDS FOR CIGARETTES

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.377
FOR EXAMPLE SMOKING --

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:31.080
YOU KNOW WE NOW HAVE IT MUCH

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:32.881
QUICKER AND MUCH MORE DIFFUSE

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:35.617
DECENTRALISED WAY AND YOU KNOW

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.953
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT --

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.722
YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT THE FCC

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:42.191
REQUIRED FOR EVERY ANTI OVER

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:44.793
EVERY TOBACCO ADD EQUAL AIR

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.328
TIME FOR ANTI SMOKING ADS

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.664
RIGHT SO THERE THERE WE HAVE

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.032
A SYSTEM FROM BACK IN THE DAY

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.900
BEFORE SOCIAL MEDIA OF WHERE

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:54.036
WE THOUGHT WE SAID OKAY THERE'S

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:55.771
A PRIVATE MARKET RIGHT THEY

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.139
HAVE A FOR PROFIT COMPANIES

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:59.074
BUT WE HAVE AS A GOVERNMENT

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.210
REQUIREMENTS FOR REGULATING

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:03.078
THE PUBLIC GOOD SIDE OF THESE

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:05.180
PLATFORMS -- SO I THINK THAT'S

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:06.482
SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE CAN THINK

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.951
ABOUT -- AND THE OTHER THING

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.385
THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.553
IS THE EATING DISORDERS AMONG

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.422
GIRLS DURING THE PANDEMIC IN

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:14.990
OUT THE PANDEMIC REALLY FORCED

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.859
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON I KNOW

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:18.060
FIRST ALL OF OUR YOUTH ONLINE

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.528
WHICH WAS GREAT MY SON GOT TO

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.063
THE PANDEMIC HAS HIM AS FIVE

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.631
BODIES COULD GAME AND THEY

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:24.032
COULD CHAT AS IF THEY WERE IN

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:25.901
PERSON SO HE WAS PERFECTLY FINE

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.337
RIGHT -- BUT ON THE OTHER

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:30.939
HAND I KNOW OF MANY CASES EVEN

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.841
IN MY OWN FAMILY WHERE WHERE

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.376
CROSS OF BECOME ANOREXIC AND

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.845
PART OF THAT IS THE SOCIAL

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.747
MEDIA REALLY TARGETING THAT

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.282
AND I KNOW THE PLOT FROM SAY

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:42.217
WE DON'T DO THIS BUT YOU NO

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.920
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ESPECIALLY

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.421
ON THE EATING DISORDER SIDE

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.824
OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.859
PROTECT OUR YOUTH -- AND NO

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:52.094
NOT IT'S NOT ONLY GIRLS WHO

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.495
ARE AFFECTED BY INTERAKSYON BUT

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.564
LARGELY IT'S IT'S OUR OUR YOUNG

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:56.999
GIRLS DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:58.801
AROUND EATING DISORDERS HOW

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.702
SOCIAL MEDIA EXACERBATES IT AND

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:01.870
WHAT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:04.640
YEAH HI THANK YOU FOR THOSE

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:06.208
COMMENTS I THINK ONE THING THAT

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.010
COMES TO MIND IS JUST THAT THE

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:08.911
DESIRE AND YOU HEARD IT FROM

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:09.878
SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:11.780
JUST MORE DIVERSE CONTENT AND

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:12.881
IT'S BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.917
WHAT DOCTOR TESKE SAID JUST

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.084
ELEVATING A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:17.986
OF QUALITY OF CONTENT BECAUSE

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:20.689
SINCE SO MUCH OF WHAT IS BEING

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:22.858
REWARDED ONLINE IS YOU KNOW

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:26.128
LIKE -- ADS RELATED

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.363
TO DIETING OR INNOVATING

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.998
SUITS IT A LOT OF IT IS IT'S

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:32.167
VERY VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:33.902
THE CERTAIN STANDARDS OF BEAUTY

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.637
THEY JUST KEEP THE JUST YOU KNOW

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:36.805
AS YOU SCROLL YOU'RE JUST SEEING

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.540
MORE AND MORE MORE OF THAT SO

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:39.708
I THINK AND YOUNG PEOPLE THEY

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.109
JUST THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:42.678
AND THEY LIKE THEY'RE FRUSTRATED

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:44.246
BY IT THEY WANTED TO SEE THEIR

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.514
FRIENDS AND AND THEY WANT TO

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.816
GO ON THERE FOR YOU KNOW TO UP

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:50.385
LIFT THEIR MOOD SO I THINK IF

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.187
IF THERE WAS THE ABILITY FOR

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:53.689
MORE DIVERSE AND MORE AUTHENTIC

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.557
CONTENT TO BE ELEVATED TO HAVE

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.960
THAT GET MORE WEIGHT -- OTHER

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.094
THAN JUST THE KIND OF THE CHEAP

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.563
ADS AND CHEAP -- CLICKBAIT

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.031
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:04.066
AND THEN THEY WOULD ENGAGE WITH

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.200
THAT AND THEN THAT WOULD GET

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:06.735
REWARDED SO I THINK THAT WOULD

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:07.836
BE PART OF IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.905
YOU'RE SEEING JUST THE CITY OF

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.907
MONOLITHIC -- WORLD WHEN YOU

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.509
GO ON A SCROLL AND THAT'S

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:15.577
NOT HELPING SOMEONE THAT'S

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:17.079
VULNERABLE TO AN EATING DISORDER

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:19.414
I THINK THAT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.149
BETWEEN YOU KNOW GROWING UP IN

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:22.517
THE EIGHTIES AND GOING INTO A

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:24.119
DRUG STORE AND GETTING UP MARIE

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.355
CLAIRE COSMOPOLITAN THAT YOU

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.090
WENT AND YOU HAD THE AUTONOMY

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:29.491
TO KIND OF CHOOSE FROM WHAT WAS

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:30.893
OFFERED TO YOU ON THE AISLES

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:32.361
IT WASN'T FED TO YOU DIRECTLY

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:34.796
BASED ON WHAT PRIOR THINGS YOU

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:37.099
HAD READ OR EVEN HOVERED OVER

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:39.434
AND SO I THE WAY I THINK ABOUT

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.103
THAT YOU KNOW A COMPARISON

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.938
SAY TO FOODS THAT WE YOU

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:43.872
KNOW WE CAN'T GET RID OF FOOD

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:45.207
ENTIRELY AND THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.308
HEALTHIER FOODS AND OTHER

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.910
FOODS THAT ARE YOU KNOW JUNK

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.444
HERE AND WE WANT TO LIMIT YOU

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:50.712
DON'T GO INTO A GROCERY STORE

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:51.980
AND HAVE AN ALGORITHMICALLY

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.583
PREDICTIVE YOU KNOW AS

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.286
A SORT OF DESIGN FEATURE JUST

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.620
PUTTING THINGS IN YOUR BASKET

01:15:58.687 --> 01:15:59.922
AND THEN NOT LETTING YOU SEE

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:01.423
ALL THE OTHER HEALTHIER FOODS

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.792
OR THE OTHER MAGAZINE IANS THAT

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.727
MIGHT ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE OTHER

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:08.163
PARTS OF YOU AS A TEENAGER AND

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.499
SO I THINK THAT -- ALGORITHMIC

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.667
TARGETING AND NARROWING IT

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.368
WHETHER IT HAPPENS BECAUSE

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.938
-- YOU KNOW IN THAT LAST JULY

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.172
THERE WERE REPORTS FROM RESET

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.740
AUSTRALIA THAT FACEBOOK WAS

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:21.843
ALLOWING TARGETING FROM OUTSIDE

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:24.746
MARKETERS TWO TEENAGERS BASED ON

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.349
A TOPIC LIKE EXTREME DIETING OR

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.851
INTEREST IN DIETING OR FITNESS

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:32.321
BUT FACEBOOK ALSO KNOWS ENOUGH

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:35.190
ABOUT ITS USERS THAT IT COULDN'T

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.959
IT CAN ELEVATE CONTENT OR IT

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:38.894
CAN AT ITSELF TARGET ADVERTISING

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.329
BASED ON WHAT IT KNOWS IT

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:41.430
DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO OFFER

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:43.365
THAT TO A THIRD PARTY ADVERTISER

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.499
IT CAN DO IT THROUGH ITS OWN

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:46.768
MECHANISM SO THE MORE WE CAN

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.170
LET THERE'D JUST BE MORE OF

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:50.072
A BLANK SLATE AND AND LESS OF

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:51.773
THIS NARROWING IN TARGETING

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:53.809
WHICH CERTAINLY CAN IDENTIFY

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:54.977
CHILDREN'S VULNERABILITIES

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.211
THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN REALIZE

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:57.612
THEY HAVE THEMSELVES IT COULD

01:16:57.679 --> 01:17:00.282
BE DIETING AND ADDS LOW BODY

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.651
IMAGE IT COULD BE IMPULSE

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:04.086
CONTROL ISSUES THAT COULD BE

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:06.188
ANXIETY OR SELF HARM OR YOU

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.756
KNOW OTHER ISSUES THAT WE WE

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.225
GEN SEE QUITE A LOT OF RIGHT NOW

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.896
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.231
OTHER QUESTIONS REMEMBERS THE

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:18.467
COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.268
JUMP IN THANK YOU SO I JUST I'M

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:22.471
MR ISN'T SOMETHING YOU SENSE

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:24.239
-- STUCK OUT TO ME -- AND THAT

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:25.240
WAS THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.375
YOU WORK WITH HAVE REPORTED

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:28.210
THAT THEY -- ARE HESITANT TO

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:30.746
REPORT TOXIC CONTENT AND YOU

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:31.613
KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I HEAR A

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.848
LOT FROM FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRIES

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.182
THAT WE HAVE MECHANISMS TO DEAL

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.283
WITH THAT SINCE I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.451
WHY THAT IS WHY DO THE YOUNG

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.786
PEOPLE FEEL HESITANT TO DO THAT

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:39.755
YEAH THAT WOULD AND THAT WAS

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:40.856
SOMETHING WE HEARD FROM THEM

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.491
AND WE -- ASKED WHAT THEY DO

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:43.692
WHEN THEY SEE THINGS THAT THEY

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.360
DON'T LIKE AND THEY JUST SAY

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:46.294
THEY DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA DO

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:47.729
ANY GOOD AND SOME OF THEM HAVE

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.865
REPORTED AND THEY JUST LIKE

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.767
IT'S SORT OF TOO LATE AT THAT

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:52.701
POINT BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.770
SEEN THE DISTURBING IMAGE OR

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:56.438
WHATEVER IT WAS IT'S NOT GOING

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.507
TO REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM --

01:17:58.573 --> 01:17:59.441
AND SO THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:00.375
LOT OF FAITH THAT IT'S GOING

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.077
TO DO ANYTHING OR IT'S IT'S

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.211
SORT OF TOO LITTLE TOO LATE

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.515
THANK YOU THE OTHER -- SORT

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:07.382
OF BIGGER QUESTION I HAVE FOR

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:08.417
YOU AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET A

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:09.484
MOVE ON IT'S A LITTLE BIT OUT

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.519
OF LEFT FIELD BUT I'M CURIOUS

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:11.653
TO GET YOUR REACTIONS TO IT

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.722
IS TWO PEOPLE THAT SPEND A LOT

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:14.656
OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THESE

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:15.891
ISSUES ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:17.893
IMPACTS ON YOUNG PEOPLE -- AND

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:18.994
THEN PARTICULAR ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.028
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS WHAT

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.430
WHAT THE LONG TERM IMPACTS MIGHT

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:22.397
BE RIGHT I THINK WE HAVE SOME

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:23.932
RESEARCH ON WHAT THE IMPACTS

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:24.933
ARE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SHORT

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.635
TERM -- BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:27.536
THEY MIGHT BE IN THE LONG TERM

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:29.671
AND I WAS READING IN THE -- THE

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:31.039
ACTUAL BACKGROUND PAPER HERE

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:33.308
THAT THAT SCREEN TIME ON RELATED

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.010
TO SCHOOL MORE THAN DOUBLED FOR

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:36.912
AMERICAN TEENAGERS UP TO SEVEN

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.780
POINT SEVEN HOURS PER DAY SO

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:39.815
MAKES ME THANK YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:40.782
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE SPENDING

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:43.285
A THIRD OF THEIR OF THEIR DAY

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:44.586
YOU KNOW PROBABLY HALF OF THEIR

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.555
WAKING TIME IMMERSED ON THESE

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:48.990
PLATFORMS AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.525
HEARD AND AND AND MISS GARCIA

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:52.194
BROUGHT THIS UP AND AND THAT

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:52.994
CHAIR BROUGHT IT UP AND I'VE

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.429
HEARD FROM OTHER COLLEAGUES ONE

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:55.797
ANALOGY WHICH IS THE ANALOGY TO

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.032
TOBACCO AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.467
A VERY POWERFUL ANALOGY IN SOME

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.501
WAYS RIGHT YOU'VE GOT A PRODUCT

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.036
THAT IS POTENTIALLY ADDICTIVE

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.037
THERE'S INTERNAL RESEARCH FROM

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:03.138
THE COMPANY THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.439
POTENTIALLY ADDICTIVE THAT IT

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.575
YOU KNOW HIS BAD OUTCOMES FOR

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:09.044
FOR FOLKS -- AND AND POTENTIALLY

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:11.079
HELP LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.114
YOU KNOW HURTFUL IMPACTS TO

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.049
PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND SO OBVIOUSLY

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.350
-- AT BOTH THE STATE AND THE

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:16.384
FEDERAL LEVEL WE'VE TAKEN AN

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.886
APPROACH TO REGULATING TOBACCO

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.321
THE OTHER ANALOGY THAT I'VE

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.022
HEARD WHICH I WHICH I HEARD FROM

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.524
A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE IN

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.859
THE INDUSTRY WHO WORKS FOR ONE

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.560
OF THESE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:26.561
WAS THE ANALOGY OF THE SEAT

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.996
BELT WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:29.297
INVENTED THE CAR THE CAR WAS A

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:30.966
GREAT INVENTION AND IT PROVIDED

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.101
A LOT OF GREAT -- ALTERNATIVES

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:34.803
AND BENEFITS TO PEOPLE -- AT

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.037
THE SAME TIME WE UNDERSTOOD THAT

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.405
THERE WERE SOME REST ASSOCIATED

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:38.540
WITH THAT AND SO WE MANDATED

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.242
PEOPLE TO WEAR SEAT BELTS --

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:41.376
AND SENATE WONDERING JUST WHICH

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.011
OF THOSE ANALOGIES SPEAKS TO

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.012
YOU UNDERSTANDING SORT OF THE

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:46.381
MAGNITUDE OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.816
ARE WE IN THE WORLD OF OF OF

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:50.118
TOBACCO SHOULD WE BE SHOULD WE

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:51.520
BE USING THAT AS THE REGULATORY

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:52.621
FRAMEWORK ARE WE IN THE WORLD

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.022
OF SEAT BELTS WERE WERE WERE

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:55.524
WORKING GREEN I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:56.658
OUT PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:57.359
BECAUSE THE FOCUS OF THIS

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:58.460
HEARING IS ON KIDS ON YOUNG

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.162
PEOPLE -- WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:01.329
THIS MORRIS TOBACCO OR DO YOU

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:02.697
THINK ABOUT THIS MORE SEAT BELTS

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:07.169
-- I'VE OFTEN USED THE ANALOGY

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.037
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.906
AROUND AUTOMOBILES AND DRIVING

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:12.607
-- SO THAT RESONATES WITH ME

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:14.176
-- BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:15.911
ALL OF THE STEPS THAT ARE PUT

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.812
INTO PLACE FOR DRIVING TO TAKE

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:20.115
PLACE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:22.417
WITH STOP SIGNS STOPLIGHTS

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:25.287
THERE'S SAFE ROADS THERE'S YOU

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:26.288
HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LICENSING

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:27.722
PROCESS TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE A

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:29.658
CARD BE APPROVED TO DRIVE A CAR

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:32.394
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF STEPS

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.428
AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S IN

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.330
THERE TO SUPPORT YOU AS PARENTS

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.032
WE TEACH OUR KIDS HOW TO LOOK

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:39.634
BOTH WAYS AND CROSS THE STREET

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:41.269
BUT WE'RE ALSO RELYING ON ALL OF

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:43.205
THAT AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.639
BE MAKING IT A STATE STREET FOR

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.675
THEM TO CROSS SO I THINK THAT'S

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:47.709
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN IT

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.578
COMES TO THEIR EXPERIENCE ONLINE

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:50.879
WE HAVEN'T REALLY BUILT THAT

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:52.314
SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.015
THEM AND SO THAT'S THE ONE

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:55.550
THAT I WOULD I WOULD RECOMMEND

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:56.685
THAT WE KIND OF GO WITH IT AS A

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:59.321
PARALLEL YEAH I TEND TO

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:00.855
THINK OF THIS MORE AS A PRODUCT

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:02.991
SAFETY ISSUE OF OF PRODUCTS THAT

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.826
WE USE AND WE HAVE TO USE ALL

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.294
THE TIME RATHER THAN IT BEING

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.597
SOMETHING ABOUT AND -- YOU KNOW

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:10.432
A SUBSTANCE THAT WE MAY NOT EVER

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:12.267
NEED TO USE WITH LIKE TOBACCO

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.402
-- YOU KNOW I TEND WHEN I THINK

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.104
OF YOUNG CHILDREN I THINK OF

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.707
THE THE TESTING THAT THE FDA

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:20.342
DOES OF BABY FOODS I THINK OF

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.143
THE YOU KNOW TOY TESTING THAT

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.345
WE DO TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:25.213
LEAD AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.649
LOW GRADE EXPOSURES IN THE

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.017
ENVIRONMENT THAT MAY NOT HAVE

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.986
A HUGE EXTREME IMPACTS BUT DO

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:33.321
MATTER CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVELY

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:35.724
OVER TIME AND SO THAT

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.425
SORT OF STATE PRODUCTS SAFETY

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.060
PARADIGM MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.596

THESE DIGITAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:08.083
PLAYS REALLY A SIGNIFICANT

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.718
ROLE AND HOW OUR CHILDREN LEARN

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.653
COMMUNICATE SHARE AND CREATE ON

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.221
A DAILY BASIS AND IN SOME WAYS

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.255
WE'VE HEARD ALMOST EVERY MINUTE

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:15.457
OF THE DAY JUST WITH SOME OF

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:17.525
THE DATA WHICH ARE TODAY AND

YES YOU KNOW ACCESS TO RELIABLE

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:20.595
TECH AND MEDIA IS INCREDIBLY

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:22.297
IMPORTANT -- FOR THE FUTURE OF

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.631
OUR KIDS LEARNING BUT WE ALSO

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.133
KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH THAT OUR

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.202
KIDS ARE BEING EXPOSED TO MORE

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.237
HURTFUL INSENSITIVE SITUATIONS

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:30.939
-- THAT WE MUST ADDRESS AND

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.340
THIS EXPOSURE HAS SIGNIFICANT

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:33.508
IMPLICATIONS ON OUR KIDS MENTAL

THE EXPERIENCE ONLINE IS

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:07.108
JUST ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:08.643
TEACHING DIGITAL LITERACY IN

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.279
SCHOOLS IS SO CRITICAL AND ALSO

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:12.781
WHY IT HAS STRONG BIPARTISAN

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:14.682
SUPPORT ACCORDING TO A FUTURE

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:15.750

CITIZENSHIP SKILLS IN SCHOOL

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:23.491
SCHOOLS NOW MORE THAN EVER ARE

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.893
LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE

KIDS AND SCHOOL COMMUNITIES

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.370
BUT WHAT THIS IS OFTEN LOOK

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:36.671
LIKE SO IF YOU'RE CELLS IF YOU

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:37.839
HAVE ANY CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:40.008
I MEAN THE STRUGGLE ITSELF JUST

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:40.809
GETTING THEM TO PUT ON THEIR

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:41.943
DEVICE TO MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.011
YOU IS ALREADY A BIG YOU KNOW

01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:44.813
STRUGGLE LET ALONE ARE THEY

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:45.780
EVEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.315
YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT AND I'M SURE

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:48.283
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:49.317
WERE YOU MAYBE SAT BACK AND

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:50.418
SAW SOMETHING ONLINE AND JUST

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:52.554
LET YOURSELF WHY WOULD ANYONE

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:55.423
POST THIS RIGHT NOW IMAGINE IF

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.558
YOU'RE AN EDUCATOR COMING INTO

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.626
A CLASSROOM FULL OF THE STUDENTS

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.395
OR COMING INTO A SCHOOL FULL

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:02.497
OF PARENTS COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:04.466
CARE GIVERS YOUR STUDENTS

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.501
AND THEY'RE ALL USING DEVICES IN

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:08.770
VERY SIMILAR WAYS SO HOW CAN

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:10.605
WE EXPECT TO EFFECTIVELY TEACH

RIGHT IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:50.438
IN MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:52.773
WE KNOW THAT PRIVACY CAN INCLUDE

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.909
A PERSON'S CONTROL ABOUT HOW

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:56.310
THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:58.746
SHARED BUT MORE AND MORE

01:31:58.813 --> 01:32:01.215
FREQUENTLY THE WORD PRIVACY IS

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:03.517
USED AS A PROXY FOR FAIRNESS

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:06.120
WE OFTEN DON'T GET A REAL CHOICE

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:08.055
ABOUT HOW INFORMATION IS USED

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:10.157
BY GOVERNMENT AND SCHOOLS AND

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:12.727
COMPANIES THE MORE INFORMATION

PRIVACY HARMS CAN BE MUCH

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:35.883
MORE POTENT FOR CHILDREN

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.186
AS I'VE TALKED TO THOUSANDS

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:40.688
OF STAKEHOLDERS I FOUND THAT

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.290
CONCERNS OVER CHILD PRIVACY

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.659
CAN BE BOILED DOWN TO THESE

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:47.695
RISKS PARENTS WORRY ABOUT

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.639
ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION OUR

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.050
PARENTS WORRY THAT THEIR CHILD

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.060
THEY ALSO WORRY THAT CHILDREN

ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY COULD

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:25.266
BE USED TO BULLY THEIR CHILD

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:27.201
OR HOW INFORMATION COLLECTED

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.869

COULD STIGMATIZE THEIR CHILD

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:35.910
THESE RISKS CAN BE EXACERBATED

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:37.244
WHEN WE ONLY THINK ABOUT A

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:27.928
WITH HOW WE CAN EQUIP TODAY'S

CHILDREN TO ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES

ONE WEEK OF CURRICULUM IN THE

AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:54.255
OUR KIDS MUST LOOK BOTH WAYS

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:56.357
BEFORE CROSSING THE STREET WE

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:58.492
MUST ACQUIT KIDS TO MAKE GOOD

PRIVACY DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES

01:35:01.128 --> 01:35:02.396
WE MUST TEACH STUDENTS THAT

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:04.498
THE MOST BASIC WAY TECHNOLOGY

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:06.667
WILL CHANGE SOCIETY IS THROUGH

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:08.536
THE CHOICES PEOPLE MAKE THE

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:10.871

USE THE ONES THAT ARE SELECTED

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.880
SCHOOL SHOULD PROVIDE STUDENTS

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:21.782
WITH TOOLS FOR HAVING THOUGHTFUL

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:21.689
INAPPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CHILD

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:23.924
TO ACCESS OR SHARE THIS IS

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.192
WHERE DEFAULT PROTECTIONS ARE

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:27.428
PARTICULARLY USEFUL CHILDREN

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:28.662
WHOSE PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.631
TIME OR KNOWLEDGE TO OVERSEE

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.032
ALL OF THEIR CHILD'S DIGITAL

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:33.701
CHOICES WILL STILL HAVE A

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:35.369
BASELINE LEVEL OF PROTECTION

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:37.104
THOSE WHOSE PARENTS HAVE MADE

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.539
AN INFORMED DECISION TO LET

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:40.808
THEM USE PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGIES

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:42.810
OR ACCESS CERTAIN MATERIALS

01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:44.745
STILL HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DO SO

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:48.882
EVERYONE WANTS CHILDREN TO BE

01:39:48.949 --> 01:39:50.284
ABLE TO HARNESS THE BENEFITS

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:52.353
OF TECHNOLOGY WHILE MINIMIZING

01:39:52.419 --> 01:39:54.822
RISKS EVERYONE AGREES THAT

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:56.056
MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:58.292
ACCOMPLISH THIS CALIFORNIA

01:39:58.359 --> 01:39:59.860
HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.929
COUNTRY AND EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE

01:40:01.995 --> 01:40:04.064
BASED CHILD PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:05.966
AND IN CREATING PRIVACY

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:08.402
LITERATE CITIZENS WE MUST NOT

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:09.703
ONLY PROTECT OUR CHILDREN'S

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:12.639
PRIVACY YOU MUST ALSO INFORM AND

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:14.742
EDUCATE THEM SO THEY CAN PROTECT

01:40:14.808 --> 01:40:17.244
THEMSELVES THANK YOU

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:23.751
THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:24.885
THAT MRS VANCE I'M NOT GOING

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:25.586
TO BRING IT BACK TO THE

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:27.521
COMMITTEE SEE IF THERE ARE

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:29.823
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS DIRECTED

01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:31.425
AT ANY OF OUR TWO WITNESSES

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:41.201
ALL RIGHT THEN I WILL I WILL

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:43.971
JUMP IN AND -- SO I GUESS MY

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:46.240
M. JUST INTEREST ONLY FOR YOU TO

01:40:46.306 --> 01:40:48.942
REACT TO MISTER ABBAS

01:40:49.009 --> 01:40:51.111
AND M. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:51.979
THINGS I THINK THAT WE HEARD

01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:53.981
FROM THAT FROM THE FIRST PANEL

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:55.349
THE WORDS THAT KEPT COMING OVER

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.351
UP FOR ME WERE CONTROL AGENCY

01:40:57.418 --> 01:40:59.853
AUTONOMY POWER -- IT SEEM LIKE A

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.689
BIG PART OF THIS IS THAT

01:41:02.756 --> 01:41:03.724
THE FACT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:04.858
LIKE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:06.026
CONTROL RIGHT AND I THINK THAT

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:07.094
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE FOR PARENTS

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:09.096
AS WELL I CERTAINLY I CERTAINLY

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:10.063
FEEL THAT WAY WHEN MY FOUR

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:11.832
YEAR OLD IS SCROLLING THROUGH

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.367
YOUTUBE AND AND ENCOUNTERING

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.469
CONTENT THAT I WORRY ABOUT M.

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:16.870
IN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:17.971
INTRIGUED ME ABOUT DIGITAL

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:19.273
LITERACY IS IT SEEMS LIKE A WAY

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:21.708
TO ACTUALLY PUT CONTROL BACK

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:23.410
INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO ARE

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:25.446
ON THE OTHER AND -- YOU KNOW THE

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:27.481
CONSUMERS THE KIDS THE PEOPLE

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:28.916
WHO ARE USING THESE PRODUCTS AND

01:41:28.982 --> 01:41:31.418
SERVICES -- AND SO I JUST WANTED

01:41:31.485 --> 01:41:33.020
TO GET YOUR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:35.255
ABOUT THAT -- MAY THINK WHAT'S

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:36.924
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.492
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THINGS

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:40.194
THAT ARE PUTTING CONTROL ON THE

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.361
OTHER END QUITE YET IN TERMS OF

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:42.830
THE DEVELOPERS AND THE DIFFERENT

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:44.798
PLATFORMS THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:46.867
LIMITED AND SO WE ARE FORCED TO

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.435
ALMOST ENSURE THAT OUR KIDS AND

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:49.903
THAT EVEN OURSELVES UNDERSTAND

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.538
HOW THINGS WORK SO THAT WE CAN

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:53.240
MAKE MORE THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS I

01:41:53.307 --> 01:41:54.575
THINK IT'S VERY EASY BECAUSE WE

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:55.676
LIVE IN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE

01:41:55.742 --> 01:41:57.177
ABLE TO GET THINGS AS WE NEED IT

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.480
RAPIDLY AND FAST AND WE START

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:00.547
TO ASSOCIATE AND THE WAY THAT WE

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:02.449
JUST NORMALIZE HOW WE USE THINGS

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:03.550
AND I'M USE THE TERM EARLIER

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:04.451
LIKE WE JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:05.886
THINGS ALMOST IN A MINDLESS

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.187
WAY BECAUSE IT'S MEANT FOR THAT

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:09.423
I MEAN REALLY THE THE VALUE

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.325
OF YOUR ATTENTION IS INCREDIBLY

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:13.660
HIGH AND SO AS YOU PAY ATTENTION

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:15.662
TO SOMETHING AS AS RACY AS

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:16.730
IT MIGHT BE OR UNCOMFORTABLE

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:17.865
AS IT MIGHT BE THAT TELLS THE

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:19.433
ALGORITHM TO SPEND WITH THIS

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.367
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:21.935
ALGORITHM WORKS YOU'LL EASILY

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:23.871
GET TIED INTO IT SO HOW DO WE

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.305
REALLY MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:27.107
UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT USING THEM

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.575
SO THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING USED

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:29.676
BUT MORE POORLY HOW CAN YOU

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:30.811
USE IT FOR WHAT YOU NEED AND

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:32.212
WHAT YOU INTEND I THINK WITH

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:33.447
MY NINE ELEVEN YEAR OLD ONE OF

01:42:33.514 --> 01:42:34.681
THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:35.649
WORKING WITH THEM ON IS GIVING

01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:37.150
THEM THE LANGUAGE SO WHEN THEY

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:38.085
SEE SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM

01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:39.486
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THEY KNOW

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:40.921
THAT WHEN THEY COME TO ME IT'S

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.289
NOT -- YOU KNOW WHAT REMOVE

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:43.323
THE DEVICE OR YOU'RE OFF THAT

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.825
PLATFORM WHICH IS A BIG FEAR

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:45.926
FOR A LOT OF KIDS ESPECIALLY

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:46.827
KIDS THAT ARE JUST KIND OF

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.762
EXPLORING IT NOW GAINING ACCESS

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:50.597
TO THESE PLATFORMS SO PROVIDING

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:51.698
THEM REALLY THE LANGUAGE AND

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:53.333
WROTE RECOGNITION THAT WHEN

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.568
YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:55.936
THAT IS NOT OKAY HERE'S HOW WE

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:57.371
ADDRESS THOSE THINGS AND WORK

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:58.238
THROUGH IT AND THE SAME WAY IN

01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.940
THE CLASSROOM WHERE SOMETIMES

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.174
AND AM I ACTUALLY OFTENTIMES

01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:02.843
EDUCATORS WILL FEEL LIKE I

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:03.911
DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:05.045
THESE ISSUES SO I'M NOT GOING

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.446
TO EVEN PUT MYSELF IN IT EVEN

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:08.448
THOUGH THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.517
REALLY HIGH QUALITY CONTENT ON A

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:12.953
PLATFORM LIKE YOU TOO CAN THEN

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.022
BE MET WITH SEVEN CLICKS AWAY

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:16.557
LIKE I'M LOOKING UP THOMAS THE

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:18.058
TRAIN AND SEVEN CLICKS AWAY ALL

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:19.359
OF US IN THERE TRAINS HITTING

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:21.562
AUTOMOBILES RIGHT VERY EASILY

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:23.830
SO RECOGNIZING HOW THESE THINGS

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:25.365
WORK SO THAT AS EDUCATORS WE CAN

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:27.034
BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.669
PREPARING KIDS TO REALLY THROUGH

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:30.070
CRITICALLY ABOUT WHAT ARE WE

01:43:30.137 --> 01:43:31.438
LOOKING FOR LET'S GIVE YOU THE

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:32.739
SKILLS THAT YOU CAN USE TARGETED

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:34.107
WORD SEARCH AND EFFECTIVE WAY

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:35.409
YOU SIGN IMAGE TO MAKE YOU FEEL

01:43:35.475 --> 01:43:37.110
UNCOMFORTABLE THANK LET'S MAKE

01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:38.011
SURE THAT WE CAN TALK THROUGH

01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:39.079
THAT WHO CAN YOU GO TO WHERE

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.714
THE TRUSTED ADULTS I KNOW THAT

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.049
THERE'S A CULTURE IN A SCHOOL

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:43.483
THAT RECOGNIZED TECHNOLOGY

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.385
HAS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY BUT

01:43:45.452 --> 01:43:46.887
ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.221
SOME HARMS IF WE DON'T PREPARE

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:49.690
OURSELVES TO ADDRESS SO MANY OF

01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:51.491
OUR KIDS DON'T TRUST THAT WE CAN

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.126
GO TO AN EDUCATOR OR A PARENT

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:54.161
OR ANYONE LIKE THAT THEY'RE

01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:56.263
GOING TO GO TO THE TO WHOM IS

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:57.364
FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THEY KNOW

01:43:57.431 --> 01:43:58.198
ALL THESE THINGS AND IT'S GOING

01:43:58.265 --> 01:43:59.633
TO BE ANOTHER KID IN CLASS

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:00.934
OR ANOTHER KID MAYBE YOU KNOW

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:01.935
THAT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY OLDER

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:03.370
WHO'S ALSO STILL NAVIGATING

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:05.405
HE'S YOU KNOW CIRCUMSTANCES

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:06.707
THAT THE RUNNING TO ONLINE

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.375
RIGHT SO WHEN YOUR POSITION

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:09.576
YOUR QUESTION ARE WE MORE LIKE

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:11.211
-- ONE INDUSTRY VERSUS THE

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:12.779
OTHER I THINK WE'RE OPERATING

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:15.015
AROUND WHAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.850
AT THIS POINT AND SO EMPOWERING

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:17.951
OUR KIDS TO THINK CRITICALLY

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.152
BECAUSE REALITY IS THERE WILL

01:44:19.219 --> 01:44:21.021
BE NEW TECHNOLOGY TOMORROW THERE

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:22.356
WILL BE A NEW ISSUE TOM YEAH

01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:24.625
ACT THREE THREE YEARS FROM NOW

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:25.626
THEY'LL BE IN A NEW PIECE OF

01:44:25.692 --> 01:44:27.094
TECH SO HOW MUCH ARE WE GETTING

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.762
OUR KIDS USE THE FILTERS THAT

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:30.597
ARE BETWEEN THIRTY YEARS --

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:31.465
AND REALLY EMPOWERING THEM TO

01:44:31.531 --> 01:44:33.100
THINK THROUGH THOSE EXPERIENCES

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.668
I'M IS GONNA BE INCREDIBLY

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:37.337
IMPORTANT AS WE WORK TO REALLY

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:38.972
LOOKING AT HOW THEN DOES THAT

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:40.807
CREATE THESE PLATFORMS ARE BEING

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:42.109
THOUGHTFUL AND AND CENTERING

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:43.610
THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR KIDS AND

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:44.911
THAT'S SOMETIME FROM NOW WHAT I

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.246
CAN DO RIGHT NOW WHAT EDUCATORS

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:48.015
ARE DOING RIGHT NOW WE KNOW

01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:48.982
THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITIES

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.217
WITH TECH WHICH IS WHY THERE'S

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:52.119
SO MUCH TAKE A CLASSROOMS SO

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:54.087
WE NEED TO REALLY BUILD THE

01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:55.822
SKILLS FOR KIDS TO USE IN REALLY

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:56.990
MEANINGFUL WAYS AND REALLY

01:44:57.057 --> 01:44:58.225
THINK CRITICALLY HOW THEY USE IT

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.894
YEAH I I APPRECIATE THAT AND

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:02.062
IT'S YOU KNOW I WAS STRUCK BOTH

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.630
BY WHAT YOU SAID BY WHAT'S IN

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:04.765
THE BACKGROUND PAPER BY WHAT WE

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:06.099
HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR WITNESSES

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:07.267
ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY NOT

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:08.301
FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE ANYWHERE

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:09.703
TO GO RIGHT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.771
SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN TALK TO

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:12.005
THAT THEY ENCOUNTER SOMETHING

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:13.240
PROBLEMATIC THEY'RE NOT SURE

01:45:13.306 --> 01:45:14.741
TO THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW

01:45:14.808 --> 01:45:16.243
LOOKING AT THE STATISTICS ABOUT

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:17.577
YOU KNOW AMERICAN TEENAGER

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:19.379
SPENDING SEVEN POINT SEVEN HOURS

01:45:19.446 --> 01:45:21.148
ONLINE I MEAN WHAT SORT OF A

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:22.649
I DON'T IS THERE ANYTHING I

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:23.650
MEAN THEY'RE GETTING MORE HOURS

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:24.885
OF INSTRUCTION FROM YOU KNOW

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:26.386
SNAPCHAT AND GOOGLE AND YOUTUBE

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:27.487
THAN THEY MIGHT BE GETTING FROM

01:45:27.554 --> 01:45:29.456
PARENTS AND TEACHERS SO THIS IS

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:31.058
THAT YOU KNOW I I WORRY ABOUT

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:33.093
YOU WE WE WE OBVIOUSLY CAN HAVE

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.095
CONVERSATIONS AS AS AS EDUCATORS

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:36.430
AS POLICY MAKERS AS PARENTS

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:37.764
ABOUT WHAT IS THE MATERIAL

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:38.932
THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS AND

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:40.033
WHAT ARE THEY RECEIVING AND HOW

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.268
IS THAT HELPING TO SHAPE THEM

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:42.736
THE QUESTION IS ARE WE ALSO

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:44.104
HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:45.272
WITH THE SEVEN POINT SEVEN HOURS

01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:46.440
OF TIME THEY'RE SPENDING ONLINE

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:47.541
YEAH YOU KNOW I COMPLETELY AGREE

01:45:47.607 --> 01:45:48.742
AND I THINK IT'S ANOTHER REALITY

01:45:48.809 --> 01:45:49.943
HAVE TO ADDRESS IS THE FACT

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:51.344
THAT WE'RE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:52.312
WORLD RIGHT NOW RIGHT WHEN

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:54.481
I GREW UP IF THE LIGHTS WENT

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:56.850
ON OUTSIDE I WAS STILL WELL

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:57.684
WITHIN MY MEANS TO BE RUNNING

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:58.885
AROUND OF MY FRIENDS YOU KNOW

01:45:58.952 --> 01:45:59.886
OUTSIDE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.288
THAT'S NOT THE CASE THESE DAYS

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:02.489
SO DEVELOPMENTALLY KIDS ARE

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:03.657
WHAT GOING TO BE WHERE THEIR

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:05.225
FRIENDS ARE AND THOSE THEIR

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:06.760
FRIENDS ARE IN ONLINE SPACES

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:08.195
WHETHER IT BE THROUGH GAMING

01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:10.163
WITH THEIR FRIENDS OR ON DISCORD

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:12.099
OR OTHER PLATFORMS SO IF THAT

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:13.500
IS BECOMING KIND OF A NEW NORM

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:15.435
THAT OUR KIDS AREN'T OUTSIDE

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:17.504
AS MUCH REACTIVE ME INTERACTING

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:18.839
WITH EACH OTHER OR JUST KIND OF

01:46:18.905 --> 01:46:20.140
NAVIGATING YOU KNOW THE OUTSIDE

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.374
WORLD THEY'RE GONNA BE WHERE

01:46:21.441 --> 01:46:22.342
THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND IF THEY'RE

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:23.677
GOING TO BE IN ONLINE SPACES

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.045
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:26.012
WE ARE THINKING THOUGHTFULLY

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:28.115
ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE THEM -- YOU

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:29.516
KNOW REALLY THAT THE SKILL IN

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:30.550
THE RESOURCE TO THINK CRITICALLY

01:46:30.617 --> 01:46:32.085
ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:32.986
SPEND ALL YOUR TIME THERE CARE

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:35.088
THE THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR I

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:36.757
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:39.226
AROUND CRITICAL THINKING IT'S

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.995
STILL VERY IMPORTANT AND SO MUCH

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:44.397
OF THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:48.668
RESTRICTING OUR ACCESS OR

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:50.437

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:52.272
IT REALLY IS AROUND ARE THEY

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:53.340
THINKING CRITICALLY TO THEY

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:54.941
REALIZE THERE'S AN ALGORITHM

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:57.644
THAT IS CAUSING ME TO SEE

01:46:57.711 --> 01:46:59.546
THIS THING AT THIS TIME

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:02.716
-- IS THERE SOMETHING THAT

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:05.285
-- IT I AGREE WITH OR DISAGREE

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:07.187
WITH AND A LOT OF THAT IS ABOUT

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:08.755
WHAT OUR TEACHERS CAN PROVIDE

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:10.457

TELL YOU VERSES THIS NEWSPAPER

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:19.166
-- THERE'S A WONDERFUL RESOURCE

01:47:19.232 --> 01:47:21.701
FROM ARTIFACT DESIGN THE MOST

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:23.303
LIKELY MACHINE WHICH IS A GAME

01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:24.905
THAT MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLERS

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:26.439
CAN PLAY TO TRY AND PREDICT

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:29.075
OUT WHICH FAMOUS FIGURES --

CLASS -- OR -- YOU KNOW MOST

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:37.117
CREATIVE AND THEN CREATE AN

01:47:37.184 --> 01:47:40.086
ALGORITHM TO SHOW THOSE THINGS

01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:41.221
THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:42.789

AND SAY OH WHAT I ASSUME TO

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:52.799
VERSUS WHAT THIS ALGORITHM

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:55.135
DOES IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.137
AND CRITICAL THINKING REALLY IS

01:47:57.204 --> 01:47:59.673
THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING STAFF

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:01.575
AND AND THE TOOL THAT WE NEED TO

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:03.944
GIVE KIDS AREN'T MOVING FORWARD

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:07.647

WELL I THINK THIS IS A VERY

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:13.587
INTERESTING DISCUSSION I GO

01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:16.323
BACK TO A MILLION AS A SLIDE

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:18.859
WITH LIKE IT'S SOMETIMES

01:48:19.125 --> 01:48:20.393
DEPENDING ON YOUR BUBBLE IT'S

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.662
EASY TO SAY WAS APPARENT I'VE

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:23.864
DECIDED I'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.031
EVIDENCE I SAID THIS IS WHAT MY

01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:26.399
KIDS CAN'T DO THIS MY MY KIDS

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:27.868
CAN'T DO MY DAUGHTER IS ON MY

OWN YOUTUBE CHANNEL SO I JUST

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:29.936
HAVE TO CHECK MY OWN YOUTUBE

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:31.071
HISTORY ON MY PHONE TO SEE WHAT

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.906
SHE'S BEEN DOING -- HENCE I

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:34.875
KNEW ABOUT THE QUESTIONING --

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:37.510
BUT YOU HAD A SIDE THAT SAID

01:48:38.311 --> 01:48:39.446
ALL THE OTHER GROUPS THAT WE

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:40.714
HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT I

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:42.582
THINK IT'S CALIFORNIA WE LEAD

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:43.917
ON THAT EQUITY SIDE AND I

01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:45.485
THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:47.120
WE ARE GOING TO APPROACH THIS

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.355
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE ARE

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:49.723

HISTORY I'M NOT SO WE HAVE TO

I THINK THINK ABOUT IT MORE

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:01.968
-- LIKE POLITICALLY I THINK

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:03.403
THERE'S A PLACE FOR EDUCATION

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:04.437
I THINK THERE'S A PLACE WHERE

01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:06.840
GOVERNMENT -- AND PUBLIC

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:08.875
EDUCATION ON THIS WITH BOTH OF

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:10.443
THE PARENTS AND THE STUDENTS

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:12.178
ARE HELPING CRITICAL TO CREATE

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:13.713
THOSE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:15.515
TO MAKE THAT EVALUATION BECAUSE

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:16.549
I COULD DO THAT AS A PARENT

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:18.318

01:51:28.281 --> 01:51:30.083
FIVE RIGHTS FOUNDATION WHICH

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:31.584
IS DRIVEN BIG IMPROVEMENTS

01:51:31.651 --> 01:51:33.520
TO CHILD SAFETY ONLINE ACROSS

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:35.121
EUROPE AFRICA ASIA AND SOUTH

01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:37.657
AMERICA AND OVER THE PAST

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.959
DECADE I'VE WORKED WITH MANY

01:51:40.026 --> 01:51:41.094
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE

01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:43.196
ACROSS THE WHILE THEY ARE

01:51:43.263 --> 01:51:46.166
UNITED AND THAT LOVE OF DIGITAL

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:49.002
TECHNOLOGY AND THEY ARE EQUALLY

01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:51.771
UNITED IN THEIR DESIRE THAT IT

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:54.074
SHOULD BE KINDA FARAH AND

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.042
MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:58.078
AND I AM HERE TODAY ON THAT

01:51:58.144 --> 01:52:01.281
BEHALF IF YOU REWIND

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:03.550
A LITTLE BIT TO THE INTERNET'S

01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:05.285
EARLY DAYS AND SPEND TIME

01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:06.419
AS I HAVE DONE WITH SOME OF

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:08.688
ITS ORIGINAL ARCHITECTS YOU

01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:10.390
UNDERSTAND THAT THE AIMS

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:12.926
WHEN NOBLE THEY IMAGINED

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:15.428
A DEMOCRATIZING TECHNOLOGY

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:17.497
NO GATEKEEPERS WHAT WILL USES

01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:20.733
WOULD BE EQUAL THIS EQUALITY

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:23.203
WAS PART OF A GRAND VISION BUT

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:25.505
THERE IS A CATCH IF YOU

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.674
TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY YOU

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:30.310
TREAT A CHILD AS IF THEY WERE

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.645
AN ACT OF IT IS ONE OF THE

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:34.747
MOST PROFOUND UNINTENDED

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:36.983
CONSEQUENCES IN THE HISTORY

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:39.385
OF TECHNOLOGY THAT THE DIGITAL

01:52:39.452 --> 01:52:41.287
WORLD HAS SIMPLY NOT BEEN

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:43.723
DESIGNED WITH CHILDREN IN MIND

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:46.960
CHILDREN HAVE NO CHOICE BUT

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:48.261
TO SPEND A LARGE SHARE OF

01:52:48.328 --> 01:52:49.462
THAT TIME IN THE DIGITAL

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:51.498
REALM IT IS WHERE THEY BUILD

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:54.567
RELATIONSHIPS STUDY PLAY FIND

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:57.437
INFORMATION AND HOPEFULLY AS

01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:59.739
THEY MATURE THEY PARTICIPATE

01:52:59.806 --> 01:53:00.974
IN CIVIC LIFE AND AND

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.843
DEMOCRACY BUT A CHILD IS

01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:06.412
A CHILD UNTIL THEY MATURE

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:08.348
NOT UNTIL THE MOMENT

01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:10.150
THEY PICK UP A SMALL FUND

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:13.920
IN TWENTY TWELVE I MADE A

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:16.089
FILM ABOUT TEENAGERS LIFE

01:53:16.156 --> 01:53:18.958
ONLINE I SPEND HUNDREDS

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:21.494
AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN KIDS

01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:23.630
BEDROOMS IF THEY WERE GOING

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:26.099
TO MEETUPS I WENT TO MEET UPS

01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:27.867
IF THEY WERE WATCHING PORN

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:30.603
I WAS WATCHING PORN IF THEY

01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:32.038
WERE GAMING THROUGH THE NIGHT

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:35.441
SO WAS I I HAVE SEEN

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:38.411
UP CLOSE SOME OF THE HOMES

01:53:38.678 --> 01:53:40.146
THAT RESULT FROM A SYSTEM

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:41.881
THAT ENCOURAGES BEHAVIORS AND

01:53:41.948 --> 01:53:44.317
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:46.819
MUCH FOR A CHILD'S EMOTIONAL

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:49.155
DEVELOPMENT IN LIFE EXPERIENCE

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:50.957
WE CAN OVER REAL LAW FOR

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:53.293
CANON OF HOMES DEPRESSION

01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:54.994
BODY DYSMORPHIA SELF HARM AND

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:57.130
SUICIDE HATE SPEECH EXTORTION

01:53:57.197 --> 01:53:58.798
VIOLENCE SEXUAL CONTENT

01:53:59.165 --> 01:54:01.167
GAMBLING OR BEING A VICTIM OF

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:03.469
CRIMINAL SEXUAL ABUSE AND

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:05.371
IN THE COURSE OF MY WORK I

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:08.041
ROUTINELY DEAL WITH CHILDREN

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:10.543
WITH THREE PARENTS AND WITH

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:13.046
TEACHERS WHO FEEL POWERLESS

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:15.081
IN THE FACE OF THOSE HOMES

01:54:16.249 --> 01:54:19.452
THE HARM IS NOT THE INTENTION

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.487
OF THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

01:54:21.988 --> 01:54:24.657
BUT EQUALLY THE FEATURES

01:54:24.724 --> 01:54:26.559
THE EXACERBATE AND AMPLIFY

01:54:26.626 --> 01:54:29.128
ON I'M NOT ELECTIONS

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:31.965
THEY ALL FEATURES OF DIGITAL

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:34.634
SERVICE AND IT DOES

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.336
NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY

01:54:38.004 --> 01:54:39.806
THE TECHNOLOGY CHILDREN USING IS

01:54:39.872 --> 01:54:41.674
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ENGINEERED

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:44.377
AND CAN BE OPTIMIZED FOR ANY

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:46.579
PURPOSE INCLUDING CHILDREN'S

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:48.915
SAFETY AND WELL BEING A SENIOR

01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:50.550
LEADER OF A LARGE TECHNOLOGY

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:52.452
FOUND RECENTLY TOLD ME THAT

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:53.987
HIS PRODUCT ENGINEERS FOUND

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:56.122
THE CONCEPT OF DESIGNING TO

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:57.757
PUT CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS

01:54:57.824 --> 01:55:01.561
FLESTE A VERY REWARDING TASK

01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:04.664
HE ALSO ADDED THEY SIMPLY

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:05.965
HADN'T BEEN ASKED TO DO IT

01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:08.701
FOR WHICH IS WHY ULTIMATELY

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:10.703
I'M A TECHNOLOGY OPTIMIST AND

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:13.106
A PRACTICE TEST THE JOURNEY

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:14.307
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD CHILDREN

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:16.609
DESERVE STARTS WITH THIS

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:19.779
QUESTION IF YOU KNEW FOR CERTAIN

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:21.447
THAT YOUR PRODUCT END USER

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.683
WAS A CHILD WHAT WOULD YOU DO

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:26.352
DIFFERENTLY FASTER

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:27.620
AFTER KNOWLEDGE THAT CHILD TO

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:29.956
DOES NOT AND TWELVE THIRTEEN

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:31.391
TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS IS STILL

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:33.026
IN THE MAELSTROM OF COGNITIVE

01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:34.594
DEVELOPMENT ON THE WAY TO ACT

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:36.896
OUT THAT TRYING TO MAKE SENSE

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:38.731
OF THAT IMPULSE IS TRYING TO

01:55:38.798 --> 01:55:40.600
MAKE RATIONAL INFORMED DECISIONS

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:42.568
THEY STRUGGLE AND THE DIGITAL

01:55:42.635 --> 01:55:44.837
WELL DESIGNED TO NUDGE THEM INTO

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:46.472
BEHAVING AS THE ENEMY THAT AGE

01:55:46.539 --> 01:55:49.375
APPROPRIATE NORTH SAY SECOND

01:55:49.575 --> 01:55:51.477
WE MUST AS UP AS OF SENATE

01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:53.646
ADULT CHILD CENTERED DESIGN OR

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:55.782
SAFETY BY DESIGN AS MANY CORNET

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:58.151
NO ENVIRONMENT IS A HUNDRED

01:55:58.217 --> 01:56:00.219
PERCENT SAFE BUT TOO MANY

01:56:00.286 --> 01:56:02.388
DIGITAL PRODUCTS ALIKE BECAUSE

01:56:02.455 --> 01:56:04.190
WITHOUT SEAT BELTS -- BREAKS

01:56:04.857 --> 01:56:06.225
I'M AS A CHILD AT THE WHEEL

01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:10.396
IT'S TIME FOR SAFETY OPERATE

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:12.565
FIVE RIGHTS HAS WORKED CLOSELY

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:14.233
WITH THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:16.102
AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS THE

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:18.805
IEEE ON SAFETY BY DESIGN FRAME

01:56:18.871 --> 01:56:20.306
WHAT THAT NUDGES INNOVATORS

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:21.774
TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AT

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:23.576
EVERY STAGE IN THE LIFE CYCLE

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:25.678
OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE FROM

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:27.580
ITS CREATION DEVELOPMENT BE TO

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:30.149
TESTING DISTRIBUTION EVEN ITS

01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:33.419
RETIREMENT FROM ME WORKING

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:35.254
DIRECTLY WITH ENGINEERS WAS

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:37.657
REGULATORY THEY ARE NATURAL

01:56:37.724 --> 01:56:39.892
PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY MADE

01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:42.929
KIA OPTIMIZING FOR CHILDREN

01:56:43.162 --> 01:56:44.263
DEPENDS CHIEFLY ON THE

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:45.698
WILLINGNESS OF COMPANIES TOP

01:56:45.765 --> 01:56:48.000
LEADERSHIP TO SAY YES THE

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:50.737
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES EMINENTLY

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:53.973
FEASIBLE THANK AND FINALLY

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.641
WE MUST PROTECT CHILDREN'S

01:56:55.708 --> 01:56:58.378
PRIVACY WHEN HARVESTING

01:56:58.444 --> 01:56:59.846
PROCESSING AND MONETIZING

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:01.614
UPDATED DEFINES THE FEATURES

01:57:01.681 --> 01:57:03.049
OF PRODUCTS AND CULTURE OF AN

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:05.451
INDUSTRY IT FOLLOWS THAT

01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:07.286
DATA PROTECTION IS A POWERFUL

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:08.654
TOOL TO CHANGE A CHILD'S

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:11.090
LIVED EXPERIENCE WHICH BRINGS

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:13.326
ME NEATLY TO THE UK'S AGE

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:15.528
APPROPRIATE DESIGN CODE IT'S

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.897
THREE OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES ON

01:57:18.231 --> 01:57:19.665
THE ANY PERSON UNDER EIGHTEEN

01:57:19.732 --> 01:57:21.501
MUST BE ACCORDED SPECIFIC

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:23.770
DATA PROTECTION THAT THOSE

01:57:23.836 --> 01:57:26.072
PROTECTIONS BE APPLIED TO ALL

01:57:26.139 --> 01:57:28.241
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LIKELY

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:29.809
TO BE ACCESSED BY CHILDREN

01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:32.378
WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT CHILDREN

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:33.646
SPEND MOST OF THAT TIME IN

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.782
PLACE IS NOT UNIQUELY DIRECTED

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:37.850
AT THEM FOR EXAMPLE INSTAGRAM

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:39.619
YOU CHOOSE PICKED UP GAMING

01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:41.687
AND THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:43.823
WILL BE OFFERED BY DESIGN AND

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:46.559
DEFAULT THAT IS TO SAY NOT

01:57:46.626 --> 01:57:48.628
BY COMPLICATED OR HIDDEN TOOLS

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:51.197
BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD BAKED IN

01:57:51.397 --> 01:57:53.933
DEFAULTS IN ADDITION THERE

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.368
ARE FIFTEEN STANDARDS THE

01:57:55.435 --> 01:57:57.069
ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THOSE IN

01:57:57.136 --> 01:57:59.005
THE CALIFORNIA AGE APPROPRIATE

01:57:59.071 --> 01:58:01.274
DESIGN A BILL INTRODUCED

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.675
BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BUFFY

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:04.677
WICKS AND JORDAN CUNNINGHAM

01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:05.878
AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:08.080
THROUGH THEM HERE BUT I CAN

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:10.817
TRACE EACH ONE OF THEM TO AN

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:12.919
INDIVIDUAL STORY OF A CHILD

01:58:13.352 --> 01:58:14.854
HIS NAME'S FOR THE REASONS

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:16.589
YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND OF CHANGE

01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:19.125
IT WAS PATEL WHO TOLD ME THAT A

01:58:19.192 --> 01:58:21.527
STRANGER USED A MAP SHOWING

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:23.896
HAVE REAL TIME LOCATION TO FIND

01:58:23.963 --> 01:58:26.199
HER IN REAL LIFE THAT LED TO

01:58:26.265 --> 01:58:28.434
STANDARD TO TEN WHICH REQUIRES

01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:30.570
JUNE LOCATION FEATURES TO BE

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:33.005
OFF BY DEFAULT IT WAS

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:35.308
MARK HE SAID HE WAS INCAPABLE

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:36.642
OF HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:38.478
A REAL GIRL BECAUSE HE'D BEEN

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:40.213
WATCHING PORN SINCE THE AGE OF

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.248
EIGHT BUT LIKE TO STAND TO

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:44.817
TWELVE WHICH PREVENTS PROFILING

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.719
TO DELIVER DETRIMENTAL MATERIAL

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:49.722
IT WAS GRACE HIS FAVORITE

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:50.990
GAME TOOK THREE HOURS TO

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:53.893
COMPLETE BUT HAD NO SAVE BUTTON

01:58:54.393 --> 01:58:56.262
SO WHEN CORD FOR DINNER BEDTIME

01:58:56.329 --> 01:58:58.231
OF SCHOOL THE POWERFUL POINT

01:58:58.297 --> 01:58:59.966
OF THE GAME AND THE INABILITY

01:59:00.032 --> 01:59:02.201
TO POLLS MADE HAVE REFUSED

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:04.537
TO PUT IT DOWN WHICH IN TURN

01:59:04.804 --> 01:59:07.206
CAUSED EXTREME MARITAL DISCORD

01:59:07.507 --> 01:59:09.442
FOR WHICH SHE STILL BLAMES

01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:12.111
HERSELF THIS CAN THIS IS

01:59:12.178 --> 01:59:14.013
CAPTURED IN STANDARD THIRTEEN

01:59:14.514 --> 01:59:16.249
THAT PREVENTS DUNGEONS INCLUDING

01:59:16.315 --> 01:59:18.251
DELIBERATELY EXTENDING USE

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:20.486
AND REPETITIVE WHO WAS TOO

01:59:20.553 --> 01:59:22.054
FRIGHTENED TO ACCESS THE ONLINE

01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:24.023
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OFFERED

THE IMPACT OF THESE POWERFUL

02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:52.871
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE PLACED

02:11:52.938 --> 02:11:54.039
IN THE HANDS OF CHILDREN IN

02:11:54.106 --> 02:11:56.308
EVERY WAKING MOMENT OF THEIR

YOUNG LIVES THERE ARE PRACTICAL

02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:01.580
MEASURED IN REASONABLE

02:12:01.647 --> 02:12:03.415
SAFEGUARDS THAT WE CAN PUT

02:12:03.482 --> 02:12:04.549
IN PLACE TO PROTECT CHILDREN

02:12:04.616 --> 02:12:07.085
ONLINE WE SHOULD FOR EXAMPLE

02:12:07.152 --> 02:12:08.654
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:10.289
NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISRUPT THE

02:12:10.355 --> 02:12:12.124
GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD

02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:14.026
SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL I WAS FOR

02:12:14.092 --> 02:12:15.327
EXAMPLE PART OF THE TEAM THAT

02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:16.528
DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED PHOTO

DNA IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT

02:12:18.697 --> 02:12:20.365
I TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOW USED

02:12:20.432 --> 02:12:21.900
WORLDWIDE TO FIND AND REMOVE

02:12:21.967 --> 02:12:23.302
PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED IMAGES

02:12:25.771 --> 02:12:27.105
THE WIDE ADOPTION SUCCESS OF

THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR OVER A

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:30.575
DECADE AND DESPITE CLAIMS FROM

02:12:30.642 --> 02:12:31.843
THE PRIVACY SECTOR THAT WE ARE

02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:33.245
GOING TO DESTROY THE INTERNET

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:35.781
-- AND DESPITE YEARS OF CAJOLING

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:37.316
DESPITE THE FACT THAT VIDEOS

02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:38.950
TODAY NOT IMAGES ARE NOW THE

02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:40.652
DOMINANT FORM OF CHILD SEXUAL

REMOVE KNOWN CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:52.764
MATERIAL WE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:54.199
THAT PREDATORS ARE NOT ABLE TO

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:56.368

ONLINE GAMING PLATFORMS FOR

A SERIOUS PRODUCT OR PROBLEM

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:02.107

CHILDREN ARE IN THE CHILDREN

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:09.348
AROUND THE GAMING PLATFORM

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:11.416
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO DRAW THAT

02:13:11.483 --> 02:13:13.785
CONNECTION IT WASN'T UNTIL JUST

02:13:13.852 --> 02:13:15.587
A FEW YEARS AGO HOWEVER THAT

02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:16.988
A MICROSOFT LED TEAM THAT I

02:13:17.055 --> 02:13:18.457
WAS PART OF BUILT A PROTOTYPE

02:13:18.523 --> 02:13:19.825
SYSTEM TO DETECT GROOMING

PATTERNS ON ONLINE GAMING THIS

02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:23.695

OR DEPLOYED BY THE INDUSTRY

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:30.302
WE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT

02:13:30.369 --> 02:13:31.436
CHILDREN DON'T ACCESS AGE

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:32.871
INAPPROPRIATE ONLINE SERVICES

02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:33.638
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:34.673
THAT AND LET'S TALK SOME MORE

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.775
ABOUT AGE APPROPRIATENESS THE

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:38.276
BASIC APPROACH TODAY TO AGE

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:39.711
VERIFICATION WHAT IS CONSIDERED

02:13:39.778 --> 02:13:40.812
THE INDUSTRY STANDARD IS

02:13:40.879 --> 02:13:41.947
TO SIMPLY ASK THE USER TO

02:13:42.013 --> 02:13:43.148
VERIFY THEIR AGE BY CLICKING

02:13:43.215 --> 02:13:44.116
THE BOX OR ENTERING THEIR

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:46.084
BIRTH DATE LET'S PLEASE NOT

02:13:46.151 --> 02:13:47.052
PRETEND THAT THIS IS IN ANY

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:49.287
WAY EFFECTIVE DESPITE THIS

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:51.390
ABSURDLY LOW INDUSTRY STANDARD

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:52.491
THERE ARE OTHER APPROACHES TO

02:13:52.557 --> 02:13:54.659
AGE VERIFICATION INCLUDING A

02:14:02.134 --> 02:14:03.435
CALM IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:06.171
GOVERNMENT ISSUED DOCUMENTS

THE DOCUMENT HOLDER TO VERIFY

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:10.308
IDENTITY AND AGE I JUST DID

02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:11.410
THIS THE OTHER DAY FOR GOOGLE

02:14:11.476 --> 02:14:13.078
I I TO MAKE A CHANGE ON THAT

02:14:13.145 --> 02:14:14.379
THE PANELISTS ASSOCIATE WITH MY

02:14:14.446 --> 02:14:16.047

02:14:16.114 --> 02:14:17.482
PROVE MY IDENTITY TOOK A SELFIE

WITH THE US LICENSE SIGNED UP

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:20.118
TO GOOGLE THAT'S HOW THEY KNEW

02:14:20.185 --> 02:14:21.920
WHO I WAS WE NOT DO THIS IT'S

02:14:21.987 --> 02:14:22.988
NOT THERE'S NOTHING YOU HEAR

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:25.590
ON A AYE BASED FACIAL ANALYSIS

02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:26.792
CAN DETERMINE WITH REASONABLE

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.293
ACCURACY IF A USER IS UNDER THE

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.529
AGE OF EIGHTEEN I AM A USER'S

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:32.464
AGE CAN BE VERIFIED AT THE TIME

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:33.765
A MOBILE DEVICES PURCHASED AT

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:34.766
WHICH POINT THE PHONE ITSELF

02:14:34.833 --> 02:14:36.401
CAN ARE SECURELY VERIFIED

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:38.370
ANY APPS OR SERVICES ARE AGE

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:40.138
APPROPRIATE I LIKE BY THE WAY

02:14:40.205 --> 02:14:41.273
WHEN THE INDUSTRY TELLS US

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:42.507
THAT THEY DON'T LIKE TO DO AGE

02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:44.242
APPROPRIATE AT AGE VERIFICATION

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:45.877
BECAUSE THE CONCERNS OF PRIVACY

02:14:46.278 --> 02:14:47.312
ON THEY SEEM TO FORGET THAT

02:14:47.379 --> 02:14:49.247
THE ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL IS

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:51.550
B. AS PROMISED I'M VACUUM UP

02:14:51.616 --> 02:14:53.618
EVERY MORSEL OF PERSONAL DATA

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:55.187
AND TELLING ADVERTISERS THAT

02:14:55.253 --> 02:14:56.421
THEY HAVE THESE PHENOMENALLY

02:14:56.488 --> 02:14:58.857
PRECISE -- PROFILES ABADEH SO

02:14:58.924 --> 02:15:00.025
THAT THEY CAN TARGET ADVERTISE

02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:01.526
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS YOU

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:02.661
CAN'T BECOME A TRILLION DOLLAR

02:15:02.727 --> 02:15:04.830
INDUSTRY BY BOBBING OUR PRIVACY

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:05.931
AND THEN WHEN WE ASK YOU TO DO

02:15:05.997 --> 02:15:06.865
SOMETHING TO PROTECT CHILDREN

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:08.200
I MIGHT SAY WELL WE DON'T WANT

02:15:08.266 --> 02:15:09.701
TO VIOLATE PEOPLE'S PRIVACY

02:15:09.768 --> 02:15:10.869
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS

02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:14.372
BEYOND THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES --

02:15:14.439 --> 02:15:15.574
THAT I'VE ENUMERATED AND MORE

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:17.476
GENERALLY WE CAN AND WE SHOULD

02:15:17.542 --> 02:15:19.110
ENSURE THAT ONLINE PRODUCTS LIKE

02:15:19.177 --> 02:15:20.912
OFFLINE PRODUCTS ARE BY DESIGN

02:15:20.979 --> 02:15:22.714
SAFE FOR CHILDREN IN TERMS

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:24.216
OF THEIR MENTAL EMOTIONAL AND

02:15:24.282 --> 02:15:26.218
PHYSICAL SAFETY THE FUNDAMENTAL

02:15:26.284 --> 02:15:28.820
IMITATION HERE IS NOT TECHNICAL

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:30.856
IN NATURE THIS IS NOT TO SAY

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:32.290
THE SOLUTIONS WILL BE EASY OR

02:15:32.357 --> 02:15:33.325
THAT THEY WILL COME WITHOUT SOME

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:35.627
COMPROMISES WE SHOULD HOWEVER

02:15:35.694 --> 02:15:36.962
HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION OF

02:15:37.028 --> 02:15:38.730
THE RISK TO CHILDREN POTENTIAL

02:15:38.797 --> 02:15:39.898
SOLUTIONS IN THE COST OF THE

02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:42.067
SOLUTIONS AND FIND A PROPER

02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:43.268
COMPROMISE TO KEEP CHILDREN

02:15:43.335 --> 02:15:45.237
SAFE WHILE ENSURING A VIBRANT

INTERNET THE BENEFITS ENVISIONED

02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:49.040
SOCIETY I ALSO LIKE BY THE WAY

02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:49.975
WHEN COMPANIES TELL US THAT

02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:51.409
THEY DON'T LIKE REGULATION

02:15:51.476 --> 02:15:52.611
-- THESE COMPANIES SEEM TO

02:15:52.677 --> 02:15:54.045
FORGET THAT THE REASON WE

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:55.814
HAVE GOOGLE IS BECAUSE THE

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:57.249
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:58.950
AND SLACK MICROSOFT AROUND FOR

02:15:59.017 --> 02:16:00.585
USING THEIR MARKET DOMINANCE

02:16:00.785 --> 02:16:03.154
TO STIFLE INNOVATION REGULATION

02:16:03.221 --> 02:16:05.223
CAN HELP CREATE A MORE HEALTHY

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:07.058
ARMIDE ECOSYSTEM SO COMPETITORS

02:16:07.125 --> 02:16:08.460
CAN MAKE BETTER PRODUCTS

02:16:09.995 --> 02:16:11.162
I LOOK FOR TO TALKING WITH

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.930
THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THESE

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:13.131
IMPORTANT AND PRESSING

02:16:13.198 --> 02:16:15.367
ISSUES THANK YOU GO BEARS

FREED AT THIS POINT I WANT TO

02:16:20.405 --> 02:16:21.339
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:23.141
FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:25.844
ASSEMBLY WOMAN WAKES THANK YOU

02:16:25.911 --> 02:16:28.079
CHECK THE REAL GOOD TO SEE

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:29.648
YOU AS WELL BOERNER HORVATH

AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR --

02:16:31.016 --> 02:16:32.717
PULLING THIS TOGETHER AND I'M

02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:35.253
EXCITED TO BE HERE -- I'VE RUN

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.221
SOME BILLS IN THE SPACE AND

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:38.657
DOING A BILL -- WITH MILADY

02:16:38.957 --> 02:16:41.626
-- THIS YEAR'S WELL ALONG

02:16:41.693 --> 02:16:43.261
WITH THEM SOON WE'RE CUNNINGHAM

02:16:43.695 --> 02:16:45.664
-- AND I WANTED TO ACTUALLY

02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.399
ASK ALL OF YOU AND I'M CURIOUS

02:16:47.465 --> 02:16:49.067
IF WE GET THE SAME RESPONSE

02:16:49.134 --> 02:16:51.670
OR NOT -- YOU KNOW BARONESS

02:16:51.736 --> 02:16:53.171
YOU'D SAID THAT OPTIMIZING FOR

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:54.372
CHILDREN DEPENDS CHIEFLY ON THE

02:16:54.439 --> 02:16:55.574
WILLINGNESS OF THE COMPANY'S TOP

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.208
LEADERSHIP TO SAY YES TO THAT

02:16:57.542 --> 02:16:58.944
AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY PUT FORTH

02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:00.445
REGULATIONS IN THE U. K. THAT

02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:02.514
ARE REQUIRING THOSE CHANGES AND

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:03.748
I KNOW YOU SAID SOME EFFECTIVE

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:04.649
THAT YOU KNOW WORKING WITH

02:17:04.716 --> 02:17:05.850
ENGINEERS ARE NATURAL PROBLEM

02:17:05.917 --> 02:17:07.118
SOLVERS WHICH I DON'T DOUBT

02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:08.420
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN I

02:17:08.486 --> 02:17:09.955
THINK THAT LEADERSHIP SAYING

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:11.122
YES RIGHT THERE HAS TO BE A

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:12.490
WILLINGNESS AND LEADERSHIP WITH

02:17:12.557 --> 02:17:14.059
THESE COMPANIES AND I THINK

02:17:14.125 --> 02:17:16.061
THERE'S AN INHERENT TENSION

02:17:16.127 --> 02:17:18.363
HERE OF THE COMPANIES MAKE MONEY

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:19.297
WHEN THEY HAVE MORE EYEBALLS

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:21.232
ON THEIR PRODUCT MORE EYEBALLS

02:17:21.299 --> 02:17:23.201
ON THE PRODUCT ARE THINGS THAT

02:17:23.268 --> 02:17:25.537
ENCOURAGE MORE TIME ONLINE

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:26.871
RIGHT WHICH IS THIS TENSION THAT

02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:27.939
THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU

02:17:28.006 --> 02:17:29.975
TRIED TO DISCUSS HERE RIGHT --

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:31.743
ARE THE THAT YOU OUTLINED SO

02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:33.812
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE ARE THESE

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:35.146
COMPANIES WILLING TO SAY YES

02:17:35.213 --> 02:17:36.281
AND WERE THERE ANY CHALLENGES

02:17:36.348 --> 02:17:37.382
WITH THAT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:38.683
TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION TO

02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:40.952
THE OTHER TWO AS WELL -- WHO

02:17:41.019 --> 02:17:42.921
HAVE REPRESENT COMPANIES AND

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.522
I'VE WORKED WITH COMPANIES IS

02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:45.890
THERE A LEADERSHIP TO TACKLE

02:17:45.957 --> 02:17:46.791
THIS AND CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME

02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:49.327
TANGIBLE EXAMPLES OF IF YES OR

02:17:49.394 --> 02:17:51.830
NO I'M WELL IT'S A GREAT

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:53.898
QUESTION AND I THINK THAT THE

02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:55.700
AND MAYBE I CAN POINT TO SOME

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:57.836
RESEARCH THAT WE DID LAST YEAR

02:17:57.902 --> 02:18:00.271
AND WE LOOKED AT COMPANIES

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:02.907
OWN DECLARATIONS OF WHAT

02:18:03.408 --> 02:18:04.843
THEY WERE DOING IN THAT TERMS

02:18:04.909 --> 02:18:06.011
AND CONDITIONS WHAT WHAT THEY

02:18:06.077 --> 02:18:07.712
DOING AND WHEN WE LINE THEM

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:09.981
UP THEY WERE DOING PRIVACY TO

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:11.683
A GREAT DEGREE BECAUSE BASS

02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:13.551
LAW AND THEY WERE DOING HUMAN

02:18:13.618 --> 02:18:15.387
SLAVERY GLASS AND THEY'RE DOING

02:18:15.687 --> 02:18:17.889
IT GOES EVEN LESS AND THAT

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:18.823
YOU'RE NOT AND IT WENT DOWN

02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:21.259
AND DOWN AND SO THE ANSWER IS

02:18:21.459 --> 02:18:23.995
WHEN THEY ARE ASKED BY SOCIETY

02:18:24.062 --> 02:18:26.231
BY LAWMAKERS TO PUT IT AT THE

02:18:26.297 --> 02:18:28.833
TOP OF THE IN TRAY THAN THEY DO

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:31.202
YEAH WHEN THE REQUIRED WHEN IT'S

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:34.339
REQUIRED SO I DON'T

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:37.208
DOUBT THAT ANYBODY INSIDE THOSE

02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:38.510
COMPANIES WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

02:18:38.576 --> 02:18:40.578
BACKUP THAT SERVICES BUT OF THE

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:43.181
CHILDREN BUT IN THE COMPETING TO

02:18:43.248 --> 02:18:45.583
MONTHS OF A BUSINESS WHAT

02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:47.652
GETS TO THE TOP OF THE AND TRY

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:51.222
IS WATCHES WITH QUIET YEAH

02:18:51.823 --> 02:18:54.459
SHAREHOLDER VALUE LAW

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:56.027
THOSE OF THE TWO THINGS

02:18:56.094 --> 02:18:58.063
SO I WOULD LIKE SOME LOSS

02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:59.898
OF EIGHT CAN SAY YES IN

02:18:59.964 --> 02:19:00.965
THE WAY THAT THEY WISH TO

02:19:03.268 --> 02:19:05.003
I THINK IT'S A MIXED BAG -- SO

02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:06.137
I THINK THERE ARE SOME ENGINEERS

02:19:06.204 --> 02:19:07.572
WHO ARE NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVERS

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:08.440
AND THEY WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEMS

02:19:08.506 --> 02:19:09.641
OF THEIR TOLD SOLVE I THINK

02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:11.142
THERE ARE OTHER A FAIR NUMBER OF

02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:12.444
PEOPLE IN SILICON VALLEY THOUGH

02:19:12.510 --> 02:19:14.679
THAT ARE SORT OF FUNDAMENTALLY

02:19:14.746 --> 02:19:16.081
BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNET IS

02:19:16.147 --> 02:19:17.716
THE INTERNET -- THE GOOD THE

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:19.184
BAD THE UGLY AND IT'S NOT OUR

02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:21.319
FAULT -- I DISAGREE WITH THAT

02:19:21.386 --> 02:19:23.321
-- I THINK THAT'S A PARTICULARLY

02:19:23.388 --> 02:19:24.522
CRAVING WAY OF LOOKING AT

02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:26.124
THE WORLD -- I THINK YOU'RE

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:27.125
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE IS

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:28.693
INTENSE PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THE

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.195
UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODEL THAT

02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:31.563
BUSINESS MODEL IS AN ATTENTION

02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:33.465
GRABBING AD DELIVERY BUSINESS

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:34.699
MODEL AND THE REASON FOR THAT

02:19:34.766 --> 02:19:35.800
BY THE WAY IS BECAUSE TWENTY

02:19:35.867 --> 02:19:37.602
YEARS AGO NOBODY THOUGHT WE

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:38.837
CAN MAKE MONEY ON THE INTERNET

02:19:38.903 --> 02:19:40.739
NOBODY ENVISIONED THAT WE BE

02:19:40.805 --> 02:19:41.806
PUTTING OUR CREDIT CARD IN

02:19:41.873 --> 02:19:43.141
BUYING SUBSCRIPTIONS IN BUYING

02:19:43.208 --> 02:19:45.410
ABSENT THAT COMFORT THAT WE NOW

02:19:45.477 --> 02:19:47.078
HAVE AND SO THE ONLY BUSINESS

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:49.114
MODEL WE COULD CONCEIVE BOB WAS

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.448
THE ATTENTION GRABBING EIGHT

02:19:50.515 --> 02:19:52.450
ENGAGEMENT METRIC OF DELIVERING

02:19:52.517 --> 02:19:54.385
ADS I WOULD ARGUE TODAY THAT

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:55.887
LANDSCAPE LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT

02:19:55.954 --> 02:19:57.055
AND THAT MAYBE WE NEED BETTER

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:58.389
BUSINESS MODELS BUT WE CAN'T

02:19:58.456 --> 02:19:59.491
BECAUSE WE HAVE FIVE TRILLION

02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:01.192
DOLLAR COMPANIES THEIR STARTLING

02:20:01.259 --> 02:20:02.627
INNOVATION IN THE SPACE

02:20:03.328 --> 02:20:05.630
ARM NOW ON THIS AND THE C.

02:20:05.697 --> 02:20:06.731
SUITE I THINK IT DEPENDS

02:20:06.798 --> 02:20:08.099
ON WHICH COMPANY TO I THINK

02:20:08.166 --> 02:20:09.200
SOME COMPANIES ARE BETTER

02:20:09.267 --> 02:20:10.535
THAN OTHERS -- I THINK SOME

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:12.170
COMPANIES CAN YOU NAME NAMES

02:20:12.237 --> 02:20:13.371
PLEASE SIGN IN YOU KNOW ONE

02:20:13.438 --> 02:20:14.272
OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT

02:20:14.339 --> 02:20:16.508
BEING A TENURED PROFESSOR --

02:20:18.643 --> 02:20:20.411
TRYING TO FIRE ME --

02:20:22.013 --> 02:20:23.982
BOB I THINK SNAP AS WELL SO FOR

02:20:24.048 --> 02:20:25.116
ME TO SAY I DON'T THINK ANY OF

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:26.084
THE COMPANIES ARE DOING A GREAT

02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:28.219
JOB -- WE WERE JUST TALKING

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:29.854
ABOUT THIS -- OVER LUNCH I THINK

02:20:29.921 --> 02:20:31.222
SNAP IS IS ONE OF THE BETTER

02:20:31.289 --> 02:20:32.423
COMPANIES I'M I THINK THEY ARE

02:20:32.490 --> 02:20:34.692
TRYING AT THE C. SUITE LEVEL TO

02:20:34.759 --> 02:20:37.128
REALLY DO BETTER BOB I THINK

02:20:37.195 --> 02:20:39.030
THAT TWITTER AND YOUTUBE HAVE

02:20:39.097 --> 02:20:41.199
SORT OF TURNED THE CORNER I'M

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:42.534
SO TWITTER HAS TURNED THE CORNER

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:44.202
FROM WE ARE THE FREE SPEECH

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:45.336
WING OF THE FREE SPEECH PARTY

02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:46.538
AN ANYTHING GOES I THINK THEY'VE

02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:47.472
TURNED THE CORNER I THINK YOU

02:20:47.539 --> 02:20:49.174
TO PLEASE TURN THE CORNER I

02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:50.742
WOULD I WOULD I WISH I COULD SAY

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:51.943
THAT'S TRUE OF FACEBOOK MATTER

02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:53.611
BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS -- I

02:20:53.678 --> 02:20:55.513
THINK THEY ARE STILL HAVE THEIR

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:56.881
HEAD PRETTY DEEP IN THE SAND

02:20:59.017 --> 02:21:00.919
YEAH AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:03.421
THERE IS AN OBVIOUS EVIDENCE

02:21:03.488 --> 02:21:04.889
THERE IS INTENSE PRESSURE ON THE

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:07.225
INDUSTRY TO ADAPT TO -- I THINK

02:21:07.292 --> 02:21:08.860
THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE I DO

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:10.161
THINK THAT YOU ARE STARTING TO

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:11.729

FOR KIDS THAT HAVE EXISTED IN

02:21:16.467 --> 02:21:17.735
THE PAST AND YOU ARE SEEING

02:21:17.802 --> 02:21:19.504

AND SELLING IT TO MARKETERS AND

02:23:18.356 --> 02:23:19.757

TO VERIFYING THAT THE KID HAS

PARENTAL CONSENT AND IS OF THE

02:25:12.637 --> 02:25:15.073
APPROPRIATE AGE I MEAN THIS

02:25:15.139 --> 02:25:16.774
IN MY HOUSEHOLD -- WE'VE HAD

02:25:16.841 --> 02:25:19.310
IN THE LAST PRICE SIX MONTHS --

02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:21.779
THIS MY INTEREST IN THIS THING

02:25:21.846 --> 02:25:24.482
STARTED YEARS AGO WHEN MY

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:25.550
DAUGHTER WHO IS LIKE TEN OR

02:25:25.616 --> 02:25:26.751
ELEVEN AT THE TIME WAS PLAYING

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:29.020
ANIMAL JAM WHICH YOU THINK ABOUT

02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:31.622
AN INNOCUOUS SOUNDING FREAKING

02:25:31.689 --> 02:25:33.724
ONLINE GAME ANIMAL JANET MY

02:25:33.791 --> 02:25:35.359
WIFE AND I DISCOVERED THAT

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:37.361
SOME CHILD PREDATOR WAS MAKING

02:25:37.428 --> 02:25:38.830
SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS

02:25:39.163 --> 02:25:40.331
TO HER WHILE SHE'S PLAN ANIMAL

02:25:40.398 --> 02:25:42.166
JAM ANIMAL JAM WAS GONE FROM

02:25:42.233 --> 02:25:44.335
OUR HOUSEHOLD TEN MILLISECOND

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.537
SAY SURE YOU UP WE'VE

02:25:46.604 --> 02:25:48.873
HAD TWO HUNDRED BUCKS OF THE

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.708
XBOX VIDEO GAME CHARGES ON MY

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:52.076
WIFE'S CREDIT CARD FOR MY SON'S

02:25:52.143 --> 02:25:53.878
BUYING FIFA PLAYER CARD PACKS

02:25:54.145 --> 02:25:56.280
RIGHT WE'VE HAD A BODY IMAGE

02:25:56.347 --> 02:25:57.849
ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSED

02:25:57.915 --> 02:25:59.383
AT LENGTH WITH ONE OF OUR TEEN

02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:01.619
TEEN DAUGHTERS -- YOU KNOW

02:26:01.853 --> 02:26:02.987
I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT THAT'S

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:05.189
JUST IN OUR ONE HOUSEHOLD OKAY

02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:08.493
SO BACK TO AGE VERIFICATION

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.162
I FIND IT BORDERING ON

02:26:11.229 --> 02:26:12.964
DISINGENUOUS THAT THESE TECH

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:15.500
COMPANIES SAY THAT WE DON'T

02:26:15.566 --> 02:26:16.968
HAVE THE CAPACITY OR THE

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:19.270
CAPABILITY TO VERIFY THAT THE

02:26:19.337 --> 02:26:22.140
USERS ON OUR PLATFORM ARE

02:26:22.206 --> 02:26:23.975

CONSENT IN EVERYWHERE ACROSS LAW

02:26:26.611 --> 02:26:28.012
WHICH IS EIGHTEEN IN CALIFORNIA

02:26:28.246 --> 02:26:30.348
OR BE THEIR PARENTS DID IN

02:26:30.414 --> 02:26:32.049
FACT CONSENT TO THE USE OF THE

02:26:32.116 --> 02:26:34.051
PRODUCT SO I'D LIKE TO GET THE

02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:35.520
LOTS ON THAT AND MAYBE THERE'S

02:26:35.586 --> 02:26:38.089
WAYS THAT I WAS UNABLE TO THINK

02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:40.324
ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS -- I'D LIKE

02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:42.260
INPUT FROM INDUSTRY AS WELL AND

02:26:42.326 --> 02:26:44.595
YOU'RE JUST THAT FEEL FREE TO

02:26:44.662 --> 02:26:46.731
CONTACT SURE AND I CAN TAKE A

02:26:46.797 --> 02:26:49.200
FIRST AND LET ME JUST MAKE

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:51.669
SURE I WAS CLEAR IN MY IN

02:26:51.736 --> 02:26:52.970
MY TALKING POINTS I'M NOT

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:54.605
SAYING THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

02:26:55.106 --> 02:26:55.940
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE

02:26:56.007 --> 02:26:57.575
CAN'T DO BETTER WHAT I'M SAYING

02:26:57.642 --> 02:26:58.609
THE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE

02:26:58.676 --> 02:26:59.944
ARE TRADE OFFS AND THERE ARE

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:02.280
CHALLENGES WITH DIFFERENT

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:04.715
CHOICES TO ERROR AGE VERIFY

02:27:05.149 --> 02:27:07.618
-- THERE ARE YOU KNOW NEW

02:27:07.685 --> 02:27:09.887
LAWS IN THE STATE CPRE WE ARE

02:27:09.954 --> 02:27:11.122
EXPECTING YOU REGULATIONS OUT

02:27:11.189 --> 02:27:12.790
THIS YEAR THAT MAKE IT VERY

02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:14.792
CLEAR TO COMPANIES THAT WE ARE

02:27:14.859 --> 02:27:17.528
TO COLLECT IF WE ARE COLLECTING

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:18.663
PERSONAL INFORMATION WHERE

02:27:18.729 --> 02:27:19.997
TO USE IT FOR THE PURPOSE FOR

02:27:20.064 --> 02:27:21.532
WHICH IT WAS COLLECTED AND

02:27:21.599 --> 02:27:22.967
VERY LITTLE ELSE AND WE'VE

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:24.135
GOT TO DISCLOSE THAT AND THAT

02:27:24.202 --> 02:27:26.370
THERE ARE VERY -- STRINGENT

02:27:26.437 --> 02:27:28.839
-- BREACH LAWS AND PENALTIES

02:27:28.906 --> 02:27:30.741
FOR -- INFORMATION THAT IS

02:27:30.808 --> 02:27:32.977
ACCESSED -- IN CASE OF A BREACH

02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:34.612
INCLUDING SENSITIVE PERSONAL

02:27:34.679 --> 02:27:35.846
INFORMATION SUCH AS A DRIVER'S

02:27:35.913 --> 02:27:37.515
LICENSE OR OTHER GOVERNMENT ID

02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:40.384
-- I THINK WHEN YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:27:40.451 --> 02:27:42.553
TALKING ABOUT CURRENT TECHNOLOGY

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:43.588
I THINK THAT'S THE TRADE OFF

02:27:43.654 --> 02:27:45.056
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:47.091
DO WE WANT TO USE SOME OF THIS

02:27:47.158 --> 02:27:48.292
INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES

02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:50.194
OF OF AGE VERIFYING ANY AGE

02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:52.296
GATING THAT'S A CHOICE I THINK

02:27:52.363 --> 02:27:53.931
FOR THIS BODY BUT THERE ARE

02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:55.299
STRONG INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES

02:27:55.366 --> 02:27:56.567
TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DATA

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:58.002
THAT WE HAVE AND MINIMIZE THE

02:27:58.069 --> 02:27:59.503
USES FOR WHICH AND I THINK

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:01.272
I MENTIONED IN MY MY TALKING

02:28:01.339 --> 02:28:02.473
POINTS I THINK THERE ARE WAYS

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.375
THAT WE COLLECTIVELY AS AN

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:06.310
INDUSTRY UNITING SOME OF THE

02:28:06.377 --> 02:28:07.979
OPERATING SYSTEM PROVIDERS

02:28:08.312 --> 02:28:10.147
THE INTERNET BROWSERS THE

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:13.150
END USER AND USER'S WEBSITES

02:28:13.217 --> 02:28:15.953
APPLICATIONS -- TO REACH OF A

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:17.888
BETTER MORE PRIVACY PROTECTIVE

02:28:17.955 --> 02:28:19.690
SOLUTION -- BUT RIGHT NOW

02:28:19.757 --> 02:28:20.958
THERE ARE THOSE THOSE TRADE

02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:22.059
OFFS AND AND I'M NOT SAYING

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:23.794
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND I'M SIMPLY

02:28:23.861 --> 02:28:25.630
SAYING THERE ARE CHALLENGES

02:28:25.696 --> 02:28:28.432
WITH THAT I I I HEAR THAT THE

02:28:29.667 --> 02:28:32.003
THE THE THE THING I FIND FUNNY

02:28:32.069 --> 02:28:33.971
IS I MEAN MAYBE WE JUST SEVEN

02:28:34.038 --> 02:28:35.439
CREATED THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE

02:28:35.506 --> 02:28:37.708
TO DO IT YET BECAUSE I JUST

02:28:37.775 --> 02:28:39.443
CAN'T BELIEVE I MEAN IT TWO

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:40.945
GENERATIONS AGO ENGINEERS

02:28:41.012 --> 02:28:42.146
THAT WORKED AT THESE COMPANIES

02:28:42.213 --> 02:28:43.447
WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNING

02:28:43.514 --> 02:28:44.915
ROCKETS TO PUT MAN ON THE MOON

02:28:44.982 --> 02:28:45.650
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE

02:28:45.716 --> 02:28:47.151
DOING AND NOW THESE ARE SOME

02:28:47.218 --> 02:28:48.419
OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE ON THE

02:28:48.486 --> 02:28:51.055
PLANET I MEAN AND AND SO IS

02:28:51.122 --> 02:28:53.691
IT IS IT THE LACK OF INCENTIVE

02:28:53.758 --> 02:28:56.060
BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T SEE

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:57.361
WHERE THE INCENTIVE IS I MEAN

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:59.063
IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF SAYS YOU

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:00.131
HAVE TO DO IT YOU GOTTEN SENT

02:29:00.197 --> 02:29:01.832
TO DO IT IF THERE'S NO LAW IT

02:29:01.899 --> 02:29:03.701
SEEMS LIKE THE INCENTIVES WHICH

02:29:03.768 --> 02:29:05.169
IS HOW WE SEE IN THIS INDUSTRY

02:29:05.236 --> 02:29:07.605
GROW WHICH IT WHICH IS IN

02:29:08.406 --> 02:29:10.041
THE DATA HARVESTING AND DATA

02:29:10.107 --> 02:29:11.942
MINING FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES

02:29:12.009 --> 02:29:13.311
AND THAT'S BEEN AN IMMENSELY

02:29:13.377 --> 02:29:15.112
PROFITABLE HISTORICALLY

02:29:15.179 --> 02:29:16.981
UNPRECEDENTED WE PROP PROFITABLE

02:29:17.048 --> 02:29:19.483
RIGHT SO THERE IT'S CERTAINLY

02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:20.918
I WOULD SEE SEEM TO THINK

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:22.153
THERE'S A THERE'S AN INCENTIVE

02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:24.221
IN BALANCE RIGHT AND THAT'S

02:29:24.288 --> 02:29:26.924
AND THAT'S CAPITALISM TO AGREE

02:29:27.224 --> 02:29:28.559
AND I GOT NO PROBLEM PEOPLE

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:30.461
MAKE A BUCK BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE

02:29:30.795 --> 02:29:33.297
HAVE WE NOT NUDGED YOU ENOUGH

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:34.532
IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER

02:29:34.598 --> 02:29:35.733
HAVE WE NOT INSISTED ON THE

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:38.169
COLLABORATION OF WE NOT ME WHAT

02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:39.637
WHERE WE WERE WE LACKING HERE

02:29:40.171 --> 02:29:42.139
OKAY SO COUPLE OF THINGS I DON'T

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:43.541
THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS FOR THE

02:29:43.607 --> 02:29:44.842
COMPANIES TO SAY THEY CAN'T DO

02:29:44.909 --> 02:29:47.511
IT I THINK IT'S JUST A LIE --

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:50.915
I KNOW I KNOW I'M NOT POLITE

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:53.351
-- SO A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE

02:29:53.417 --> 02:29:55.052
IS THERE IS A LACK OF AND IT'S

02:29:55.119 --> 02:29:56.320
WORSE THAN THAT THERE'S NOT A

02:29:56.387 --> 02:29:57.888
LACK OF AN INCENTIVE IT NOT ONLY

02:29:57.955 --> 02:29:59.190
IS THERE NO LAW SAYING YOU HAVE

02:29:59.256 --> 02:30:01.058
TO DO IT THERE'S NO LIABILITY

02:30:01.359 --> 02:30:02.159
THESE COMPANIES HAVE SECTION

02:30:02.226 --> 02:30:03.260
TWO THIRTY THE COMMUNICATIONS

02:30:03.327 --> 02:30:05.062
DECENCY ACT WHICH IS BASICALLY

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:06.564
EVERYTHING GETS KICKED BEFORE

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:08.466
THE JUDGE EVEN SEES ANYTHING

02:30:08.532 --> 02:30:09.333
SO THERE THERE ISN'T EVEN A

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:11.335
LIABILITY THE BACK AND I'M LIKE

02:30:11.402 --> 02:30:12.970
AUTOMOBILES RIGHT YOU BUILD A

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:15.172
CRAPPY CAR AND IT CRASHES AND

02:30:15.239 --> 02:30:16.507
I DIE IN IT YOU'RE GONNA GET

02:30:16.574 --> 02:30:18.342
SUED RIGHT YOU CAN'T SAY THAT

02:30:18.409 --> 02:30:19.410
ABOUT THE PRODUCTS OF THERE'S NO

02:30:19.477 --> 02:30:21.512
LIABILITY AT ONE AND THERE'S NO

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:23.514
LAWS AT THE OTHER END I'M TO THE

02:30:23.581 --> 02:30:24.882
POINT ABOUT THAT WHAT WE DON'T

02:30:24.949 --> 02:30:26.083
WANT TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION

02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:27.084
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GET

02:30:27.151 --> 02:30:29.019
STOLEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO RETAIN

02:30:29.086 --> 02:30:30.755
THIS INFORMATION YOU DON'T HAVE

02:30:30.821 --> 02:30:32.590
TO HOLD ONTO IT THAT THAT THAT

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:33.457
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

02:30:33.524 --> 02:30:34.425
THIS ARGUMENT DOESN'T MAKE ANY

02:30:34.492 --> 02:30:36.193
SENSE RIGHT VERIFIED MENTALLY

02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:37.762
THE THE THE DATA OR AT LEAST

02:30:37.828 --> 02:30:39.263
HARD ENCRYPTED AT THE BACK AND

02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:40.598
WE KNOW HOW TO DO ENCRYPTION

02:30:41.132 --> 02:30:42.533
AREN'T SO AT THAT ARGUMENT

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:43.834
DOESN'T REALLY WORK I THINK

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:44.902
IT'S I THINK IT'S A COMPLETE

02:30:44.969 --> 02:30:46.570
RED HERRING TO SAY WE DON'T

02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:47.405
WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:48.472
NO INCENTIVE AND BECAUSE IT'S

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:49.874
BAD FOR BUSINESS AND WE SHOULD

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:51.342
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS BAD FOR

02:30:51.409 --> 02:30:52.943
BUSINESS RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO

02:30:53.010 --> 02:30:55.112
CREATE FRICTION THE REASON WHY

02:30:55.179 --> 02:30:56.814
SOCIAL MEDIA WORKS SO WELL IS

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:58.816
BECAUSE IT'S FRICTIONLESS BUT

02:30:58.883 --> 02:31:00.751
YOU KNOW WHAT FRICTION IS GOOD

02:31:01.018 --> 02:31:02.386
FRICTION IN THE CRYPTO WORLD IS

02:31:02.453 --> 02:31:03.621
GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS PREVENT

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:05.222
FRAUD NOT ENOUGH THIS TO A LOT

02:31:05.289 --> 02:31:06.824
OF FRAUD IN IT BUT THE REASON

02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:08.926
WE PUT FRICTION IN SYSTEMS IS TO

02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:11.429
SLOW DOWN THE BAD ACTORS RIGHT

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:12.630
WE DON'T HAVE THAT THE SOCIAL

02:31:12.696 --> 02:31:13.597
MEDIA COMPANIES BECAUSE WE WANT

02:31:13.664 --> 02:31:15.032
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SIGN OUT

02:31:15.699 --> 02:31:17.234
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE

02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:18.402
THAT'S AN EYEBALL AND THAT'S

02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:20.037
AN AD AND THAT'S MONEY THAT

02:31:20.104 --> 02:31:21.472
WE PUT FRICTION IN THAT SYSTEM

02:31:21.539 --> 02:31:23.441
TO OKAY I GOT MY LICENSE AND

02:31:23.507 --> 02:31:24.608
TAKE A PICTURE OF A BLIND I'M

02:31:24.675 --> 02:31:26.076
WILLING TO DO THAT TO GET MY

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:27.411
CREDIT CARD IF YOU GET A CRYPTO

02:31:27.478 --> 02:31:29.547
ACCOUNT BUT MAYBE I'M GONNA LOSE

02:31:29.613 --> 02:31:30.481
TWENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO

02:31:30.548 --> 02:31:31.782
SIGNED UP FOR AN ACCOUNT THAT'S

02:31:31.849 --> 02:31:33.884
ANNOYING RIGHT SO I THINK THAT

02:31:33.951 --> 02:31:35.820
THE COLLABORATION HERE HAS TO BE

02:31:36.153 --> 02:31:38.022
NOT WE CAN'T DO IT WE WERE

02:31:38.088 --> 02:31:39.757
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY AND

02:31:39.824 --> 02:31:40.791
THEN THE GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN

02:31:40.858 --> 02:31:41.759
AND BEATING EVERYBODY OVER THE

02:31:41.826 --> 02:31:43.027
HEAD WITH THE CLUB ALTHOUGH I

02:31:43.093 --> 02:31:44.695
WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT I'M IS TO

02:31:44.762 --> 02:31:46.730
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE REALIGN THE

02:31:46.797 --> 02:31:48.265
INCENTIVES AND HOW DO WE MAKE

02:31:48.332 --> 02:31:49.767
THIS IS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE SO

02:31:49.834 --> 02:31:51.035
FOR EXAMPLE YOU BEEN MENTIONING

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:52.970
SEVERAL TIMES OPERATING SYSTEMS

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:54.872
BROWSERS THE MOBILE DEVICES

02:31:54.939 --> 02:31:56.373
CAN BE CENTRALIZED AT NIGHT IS

02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:57.575
BASICALLY TO PHONE MAKERS IN THE

02:31:57.641 --> 02:31:59.310
WORLD ANDROID AND APPLE RIGHT

02:31:59.376 --> 02:32:01.412
SO WHAT WE CENTRALIZED WITH

02:32:01.479 --> 02:32:02.646
THAT MAKE IT TO EVERY APP COULD

02:32:02.713 --> 02:32:04.081
ACCESS WITH MY AGES SO THAT

02:32:04.148 --> 02:32:05.983
WE CAN VERIFY ON THE PROJECT

02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:07.384
CAN ACCESS THIS DOESN'T SOLVE

02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:08.285
ALL THE PROBLEMS BY THE WAY

02:32:08.352 --> 02:32:09.753
WE STOP LAPTOPS AND DESKTOPS

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:10.788
AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT DEVICES

02:32:10.855 --> 02:32:11.822
WITH THE THINK ABOUT PEOPLE TO

02:32:11.889 --> 02:32:13.457
SWITCH ACCOUNTS BUT SO I THINK

02:32:13.524 --> 02:32:14.925
WE HAVE TO THINK MORE CREATIVELY

02:32:14.992 --> 02:32:16.494
AND WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:17.828
THAT THERE ISN'T A WAY TO SOLVE

02:32:17.895 --> 02:32:19.730
THIS PROBLEM OR THAT IT SOMEHOW

02:32:19.797 --> 02:32:21.432
IS GOING TO PUT EVERYBODY AT

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:22.967
RISK I THINK IT'S SIMPLY UNTRUE

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:26.070
I THINK I'M GONNA GO BACK

02:32:26.136 --> 02:32:27.972
TO THE WORD DISINGENUOUS

02:32:28.305 --> 02:32:30.808
-- FOR DECORUM SAKE BUT

02:32:30.875 --> 02:32:33.077
I I I THINK THAT -- I THINK

02:32:33.143 --> 02:32:35.412
THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE ONE IS

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:37.414
WHETHER YOU CAN AND ACTUALLY

02:32:37.481 --> 02:32:39.583
THAT'S A GREAT MANY WAYS OF

02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:40.851
DOING IT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE

02:32:40.918 --> 02:32:42.253
TO BE CENTRALIZED IT CAN BE

02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:43.487
IT'S AN OPERATING SYSTEM IT

02:32:43.554 --> 02:32:45.990
CAN BE A TOKEN AND IT CAN

02:32:46.056 --> 02:32:48.425
BE A NUMBER YOU KNOW OF

02:32:48.492 --> 02:32:50.027
VOICE IT CAN BE A FACE AND

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:52.630
THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS AND

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.265
IN LOOKING AT ONE OF THOSE WAYS

02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:55.866
THE BIT THAT IS MISSING IS THE

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:57.701
GOVERNMENT SPIT THE BIT THAT

02:32:57.768 --> 02:32:59.570
WOULD ENSURE USE OF PRIVACY

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:02.239
ENSURE THAT SECURITY AND ENSURE

02:33:02.306 --> 02:33:04.542
THAT EFFICACY BECAUSE I THINK

02:33:04.608 --> 02:33:06.877
IT'S THE BILL THAT IS A A

02:33:06.944 --> 02:33:09.079
LINE IF YOU LIKE IS TO SAY IT'S

02:33:09.146 --> 02:33:11.382
NOT HAPPENING YOU KNOW ONE OF

02:33:11.448 --> 02:33:13.350
THE THINGS THAT GETS SHED WHEN

02:33:13.417 --> 02:33:15.219
YOU USE YOUR LOG IN FROM ONE

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:16.921
COMPANY TO THE NEXT IT'S YOUR

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:19.924
AGE RANGE YEAH IT IS CONSTANTLY

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:22.259
SHED YOUR AGE ALL OF OUR AGE

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:24.128
INCLUDING KIDS SO I THINK I

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:26.230
THINK THE THAT'S ONE BIT BUT

02:33:26.297 --> 02:33:27.898
I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK ANOTHER

02:33:27.965 --> 02:33:30.167
QUESTION ABOUT WHY IS THIS SUCH

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:32.236
A LOT OF RESISTANCE BECAUSE THE

02:33:32.303 --> 02:33:34.905
PURPOSE LIMITATION ALSO DOES

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:37.775
-- ACCRUE TO A DIFFERENCE

02:33:37.841 --> 02:33:38.642
IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE GONNA

02:33:38.709 --> 02:33:40.177
PUT THIS LIMITATION AND IN

02:33:40.244 --> 02:33:41.946
YOUR LOCAL AND THEN SAID THAT

02:33:42.012 --> 02:33:43.781
IT DOESN'T IT BUT IT DOESN'T

02:33:43.847 --> 02:33:45.916
ACCRUE TO AGE INSURANCE IT DOES

02:33:46.116 --> 02:33:48.352
RIGHT SO WHY IS THERE SO MUCH

02:33:48.419 --> 02:33:50.354
RESISTANCE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE

02:33:50.421 --> 02:33:54.091
RESPONSIBILITY THAT HAPPENS

02:33:54.158 --> 02:33:55.492
ONCE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS A

02:33:55.559 --> 02:33:57.728
CHILD RIGHT SO THE

02:33:57.795 --> 02:34:00.197
CHILDREN ARE BEING TARGETED

02:34:01.031 --> 02:34:03.467
FOR ADVERTISING AND IN FACT

02:34:03.534 --> 02:34:04.868
I WOULD SAY THAT COMPANIES HAVE

02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:07.137
DONE QUITE A GOOD JOB OF MAKING

02:34:07.404 --> 02:34:09.440
AT AGE AT ADVERTISING AGE

02:34:09.506 --> 02:34:10.641
APPROPRIATE OVER THE LAST FEW

02:34:10.708 --> 02:34:11.976
YEARS IT'S A GREAT DEAL BETTER

02:34:12.042 --> 02:34:13.544
THAN IT WAS WHEN I STARTED THIS

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:15.946
CONVERSATION HOWEVER THOSE

02:34:16.013 --> 02:34:17.581
SAME CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN

02:34:17.648 --> 02:34:20.317
IDENTIFIED AS RECEIVING

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:22.820
AGE APPROPRIATE ADVERTISING

02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:24.521
ARE BEING SENT CENTCOM

02:34:26.890 --> 02:34:28.559
PURSUE SITE MESSAGES AND SO ON

02:34:28.759 --> 02:34:30.961
BECAUSE THE COMPANIES ARE NOT

02:34:31.028 --> 02:34:32.863
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:35.199
AGE OUTSIDE OF THE ADVERTISING

02:34:35.432 --> 02:34:36.967
SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE TALK

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:38.235
ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO REALLY

02:34:38.302 --> 02:34:39.737
SEPARATE AT THESE TWO ISSUES

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:42.039
WHAT IS THE FEASIBILITY TOTALLY

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:44.541
TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY YOU

02:34:44.608 --> 02:34:46.076
KNOW WHY DON'T I WANT TO DO IT

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:47.845
BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:50.347
THAT IS THE JOB OF LAWMAKERS

02:34:50.614 --> 02:34:52.750
THAT IS THE INCENTIVE PICKS

02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:56.720
THANK YOU VERY

02:34:56.787 --> 02:34:59.056
MUCH -- GERMAN

02:35:00.624 --> 02:35:02.226
YES THANK YOU I'M

02:35:03.327 --> 02:35:05.129
I LIKE TO ASK MR HOFFMAN I

02:35:05.195 --> 02:35:06.597
DON'T UNDERSTAND WITH CCPA MY

02:35:06.664 --> 02:35:07.965
UNDERSTANDING IS IF YOU COLLECT

02:35:08.032 --> 02:35:09.266
DATA FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSE

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:10.334
ECONOMY ONLY USE FOR THAT

02:35:10.401 --> 02:35:11.568
PURPOSE IF YOU COLLECT DATA FOR

02:35:11.635 --> 02:35:13.003
THE PURPOSE OF AGE VERIFICATION

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:14.038
THAT I CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THAT

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:15.572
PURPOSE SO THEN YOU HAVE THE

02:35:15.639 --> 02:35:17.508
AGE VERIFICATION AND I THINK

02:35:17.574 --> 02:35:19.910
I WOULD ENCOURAGE TECHNICAL

02:35:19.977 --> 02:35:21.545
AND ALL THE TECH COMPANIES TO

02:35:21.612 --> 02:35:22.479
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR

02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:24.448
THIS IT IS NOT OKAY THE SUMMIT

02:35:24.515 --> 02:35:26.483
IS AND IS THEIR AGE THAT'S LIKE

02:35:26.817 --> 02:35:28.152
GIVING SOMEBODY A FREE PASS OF

02:35:28.218 --> 02:35:29.687
THE FAKE ID IN THE EIGHTIES LIKE

02:35:29.753 --> 02:35:31.622
THAT'S INSANE WE ARE FAR BEYOND

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:32.923
THAT AND THE TECHNOLOGIES WE ON

02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:34.458
THAT SIDE REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:37.027
TO INSTEAD OF SAYING WHY THIS

02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:39.329
DOESN'T WORK TO COME BACK TO US

02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:41.665
AND SAY THIS DOES WORK BECAUSE

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:43.801
WE HAVE TO AGE VERIFY AND I'M

02:35:43.867 --> 02:35:45.102
NOT EVEN SURE THIRTEEN IS THE

02:35:45.169 --> 02:35:46.270
RIGHT AGE I HAVE A FOURTEEN

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:48.005
YEAR OLD SON I'M NOT SURE THAT'S

02:35:48.072 --> 02:35:49.239
THE RIGHT AGE AT ALL I DON'T

02:35:49.306 --> 02:35:50.307
KNOW WHERE THIRTEEN CAME FROM

02:35:50.374 --> 02:35:51.975
JORDAN PROBABLY KNOWS THAT I

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:53.544
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM SORRY

02:35:55.379 --> 02:35:56.280
YEAH THAT'S RIDICULOUS I

02:35:56.346 --> 02:35:58.148
DON'T KNOW WHY WE DID WHAT WE

02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:02.219
WELL THAT'S WHY ANYWAYS I'M

02:36:02.519 --> 02:36:03.754
YEAH I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO

02:36:03.821 --> 02:36:06.123
LOOK AT THE AGE LIMIT I'M I'M

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:08.892
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT I'M FULLY

02:36:08.959 --> 02:36:11.729
FORMED BRAINS -- PROCESSING

02:36:11.795 --> 02:36:12.596
THE AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT HAD

02:36:12.663 --> 02:36:13.764
TO PROCESS THE LAST TWO YEARS

02:36:13.831 --> 02:36:15.332
HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT ON OUR YOUTH

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:18.235
AND AS I SAID EARLIER IN

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:20.270
SOME WAYS SOCIAL MEDIA ONLINE

02:36:20.337 --> 02:36:22.306
PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN A GODSEND

02:36:22.606 --> 02:36:23.841
IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE CONNED

02:36:23.907 --> 02:36:25.976
CAUSED IRREPARABLE HARM AND THE

02:36:26.043 --> 02:36:27.311
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE TO

02:36:27.377 --> 02:36:29.213
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT

02:36:29.613 --> 02:36:31.915
AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW

02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:33.884
YOU CAN TRUST BUT VERIFY BUT I

02:36:33.951 --> 02:36:36.053
DO BELIEVE VERY VERY STRONGLY

02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:37.988
THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE LEGAL

02:36:38.055 --> 02:36:41.225
RAMIFICATIONS FOR OUR LEGAL

02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:43.861
A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENSURING

02:36:44.094 --> 02:36:44.928
THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR

02:36:44.995 --> 02:36:47.364
KIDS WE WANT PROTECT THEM THAT

02:36:47.431 --> 02:36:49.166
WE'VE EXPANDED THE ANTI HUMAN

02:36:49.233 --> 02:36:51.201
TRAFFICKING REGULATIONS TO GET

02:36:51.268 --> 02:36:53.036
AT HUMAN TRAFFICKERS IN REAL

02:36:53.103 --> 02:36:54.838
LIFE AND IT'S THE SAME ONLINE

02:36:54.905 --> 02:36:55.939
WHEN I DID THAT WEAPON ARE

02:36:56.006 --> 02:36:57.841
WITH MY D. A. AT HOME WHAT I

02:36:57.908 --> 02:36:59.643
LEARNED PREVENTED ME FROM EVER

02:36:59.710 --> 02:37:01.378
LETTING MY CHILDREN GO ON SOME

02:37:01.445 --> 02:37:02.746
OF THESE PLATFORMS I HAD TO HAVE

02:37:02.813 --> 02:37:03.881
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:37:03.947 --> 02:37:06.216
MY THEN THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AND

02:37:06.283 --> 02:37:08.018
MY TEN YEAR OLD ABOUT HOW DO

02:37:08.085 --> 02:37:09.753
YOU VERIFY SOMEBODY'S REALLY A

02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:11.321
FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FROM OAKLAND

02:37:11.588 --> 02:37:12.689
AND NOT A FORTY SEVEN YEAR

02:37:12.756 --> 02:37:14.658
OLD MAN FROM KENTUCKY SORRY

02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:16.960
MAN THANK YOU BUT YOU KNOW

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:19.029
HOW HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL HAVE

02:37:19.096 --> 02:37:20.164
THOSE CONVERSATIONS MARKETS

02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:21.665
BUT NOT EVERY PARENT HAS THE

02:37:21.732 --> 02:37:23.500
TIME AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

02:37:23.567 --> 02:37:24.802
IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION

02:37:24.868 --> 02:37:26.203
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER CALIFORNIA

02:37:26.503 --> 02:37:28.071
WE DO HAVE UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS

02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:30.240
SO HOW ARE YOU GETTING AT THE

02:37:30.307 --> 02:37:31.875
UNDOCUMENTED AS WELL SO WHEN WE

02:37:31.942 --> 02:37:33.677
THINK ABOUT THAT SO I CHALLENGE

02:37:33.744 --> 02:37:35.078
THE TECH COMPANIES TO COME

02:37:35.145 --> 02:37:36.780
BACK TO US WITH SOME SORT OF

02:37:36.847 --> 02:37:38.248
SOLUTION THAT'S GONNA DRESS THE

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:39.082
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

02:37:39.149 --> 02:37:40.751
UP BECAUSE THAT ISSUES BROUGHT

02:37:40.818 --> 02:37:42.653
UP BY THE BEARS VANNESS SORRY

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.756
AND DR FRED ARE OF VERY CLEARLY

02:37:45.823 --> 02:37:46.824
I THINK IN THE INTERESTS OF

02:37:46.890 --> 02:37:48.392
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND YOU

02:37:48.458 --> 02:37:49.459
HAVE A BUNCH OF PARENTS ON

02:37:49.526 --> 02:37:50.894
THIS PANEL YOU'RE A BUNCH OF

02:37:50.961 --> 02:37:52.696
PARENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND

02:37:52.763 --> 02:37:53.697
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR

02:37:53.764 --> 02:37:55.699
CHILDREN FOR WHATEVER IT TAKES

02:37:56.033 --> 02:37:57.134
SO THAT'S WHY I GUESS IT'S

02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:58.035
NOT A QUESTION I GUESS THAT'S

02:37:58.101 --> 02:38:00.003
MY STATEMENT ON THE SPELL

02:38:01.738 --> 02:38:02.472
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THE

02:38:02.539 --> 02:38:03.607
VERY NICE YOU WANTED TO COMMENT

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:05.676
ON THAT I JUST WANTED TO PICK

02:38:05.742 --> 02:38:06.910
UP ON SOMETHING THE CHAIRWOMAN

02:38:06.977 --> 02:38:09.279
SAID ABOUT AT THAT AGE RANGE I

02:38:09.346 --> 02:38:10.781
THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:38:10.848 --> 02:38:12.950
IN THIS CONVERSATION NOT

02:38:13.016 --> 02:38:15.052
TO SEE AGE VERIFICATION AS THE

02:38:15.519 --> 02:38:18.255
OPPORTUNITY TO KICK KIDS OFF THE

02:38:18.322 --> 02:38:20.991
INTERNET IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY

02:38:21.058 --> 02:38:23.026
TO TREAT THEM ACCORDING TO THAT

02:38:23.093 --> 02:38:25.596
AGE AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT

02:38:25.929 --> 02:38:27.497
STUFF IT'S A LAW AND I WOULD

02:38:27.564 --> 02:38:29.366
LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE

02:38:29.433 --> 02:38:30.901
GOOD THINGS THAT THE COMPANIES

02:38:30.968 --> 02:38:32.769
HAVE DONE IN RELATION TO THE

02:38:32.836 --> 02:38:35.005
CODE'S SO IF ACTUALLY YOU WORK

02:38:35.072 --> 02:38:36.373
OUT IT'S A SEVEN YEAR OLD MAYBE

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:37.641
YOU NEED TO GET THE PREVIOUS C.

02:38:37.708 --> 02:38:40.677
NOTICE IN THE VIDEO OR CONTENT

02:38:40.944 --> 02:38:42.846
MAYBE YOU CAN ACTUALLY OFFER A

02:38:42.913 --> 02:38:45.415
LITTLE BIT MORE HELP AS THEY TRY

02:38:45.482 --> 02:38:48.051
AND A DOWNGRADE THAT PRIVACY

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:50.320
SETTING AND SO ON THE THE THE

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:53.290
IDENTIFYING OF AGE ISN'T REALLY

02:38:53.357 --> 02:38:55.592
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SAFETY

02:38:55.659 --> 02:38:57.694
WITH THE CHILD AS THEY GROW

02:38:57.761 --> 02:38:59.096
BECAUSE A FIFTY A FIFTEEN

02:38:59.162 --> 02:39:00.330
YEAR OLD OUR SEVENTEEN YEAR

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:01.331
OLD DOESN'T NEED THE SAME

02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:03.200
PROTECTION THEY NEED DIFFERENT

02:39:03.267 --> 02:39:05.469
PROTECTIONS ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY

02:39:05.869 --> 02:39:08.238
M. ON H. AND AND IT SHOULD

02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:09.973
NOT BE TESTING MUST NOT BE

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:11.842
TESTING BECAUSE THE MAJORITY

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:12.776
OF CHILDREN WHO COME TO

02:39:12.843 --> 02:39:14.745
HARM OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND

02:39:14.811 --> 02:39:17.247
SEVENTEEN RIGHT AND THEY HAVE

02:39:17.314 --> 02:39:19.016
NO PROTECTIONS THEY ARE TREATED

02:39:19.082 --> 02:39:21.084
AS IF THEY'RE ADULTS SO THIS HAS

02:39:21.151 --> 02:39:23.587
TO BE A SOPHISTICATED LOOK OF

02:39:23.654 --> 02:39:25.789
RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE TECH

02:39:25.856 --> 02:39:27.257
COMPANY I BELIEVE THEY CAN

02:39:27.324 --> 02:39:29.526
DO IT WE JUST HAVE TO SET THE

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:32.262
SET THE BOX READ ONE MORE THING

02:39:32.329 --> 02:39:34.064
HERE UP I AGREE WE SHOULD THINK

02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:35.899
ABOUT THE H. CAREFULLY AS YOU'RE

02:39:35.966 --> 02:39:37.134
THINKING ABOUT THAT I'M NOT

02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:38.402
A CHILD ABOUT MENTAL YOU'VE

02:39:38.468 --> 02:39:40.671
HEARD FROM THAT EARLY ON BUT ME

02:39:40.737 --> 02:39:41.972
REMIND YOU THAT THE PREFRONTAL

02:39:42.039 --> 02:39:43.840
CORTEX FULLY DEVELOPED IN THE

02:39:43.907 --> 02:39:46.176
EARLY TO MID TWENTIES RIGHT

02:39:46.243 --> 02:39:47.577
SO THE KIDS I'M TEACHING AT

02:39:47.644 --> 02:39:49.813
UC BERKELEY ARE YOU ARE NOT

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.248
FULLY DEVELOPED IN THERE THE

02:39:51.315 --> 02:39:52.916
PREFRONTAL CORTEX ON THAT MEANS

02:39:52.983 --> 02:39:54.318
EXECUTIVE FUNCTION DECISION

02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:56.820
MAKING UNDERSTANDING RISK NOT

02:39:56.887 --> 02:39:57.888
FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL YOUR MID

02:39:57.955 --> 02:39:59.356
TWENTIES SO THAT THINK ABOUT

02:39:59.423 --> 02:40:00.557
THAT IN RELATION TO A THIRTEEN

02:40:00.624 --> 02:40:01.525
YEAR OLD A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD A

02:40:01.591 --> 02:40:02.559
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SIXTEEN YEAR

02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:04.328
OLD AND WE SHOULD VERY HAVE VERY

02:40:04.394 --> 02:40:05.329
SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT

02:40:05.395 --> 02:40:07.130
THAT AGES -- I GREW THE BARONESS

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:08.332
THIRTEEN IS WAY TOO YOUNG

02:40:11.068 --> 02:40:12.936
MISTER BUMP I'M GLAD THAT

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:14.871
YOU JUST BROUGHT THAT UP --

02:40:14.938 --> 02:40:16.807
BECAUSE I THINK -- -- THAT

02:40:16.873 --> 02:40:19.076
THE OPPOSED EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD

02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:21.812
TO USE -- YOUNG ADULTS

02:40:22.279 --> 02:40:24.181
-- ARE VERY MUCH TARGETED

02:40:24.247 --> 02:40:27.317
TO -- -- BY -- ONLINE

02:40:27.851 --> 02:40:30.020
PRODUCTS AND BEHAVIOR --

02:40:30.821 --> 02:40:33.523
WHEN IT COMES TO -- EIGHT

02:40:33.757 --> 02:40:35.359
-- THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE

02:40:35.425 --> 02:40:38.562
TERRORISM A HAN A BODY

02:40:38.628 --> 02:40:40.030
IMAGE I THINK -- YOU KNOW

02:40:40.097 --> 02:40:42.099
FOR MANY YOUNG ADULTS OF THAT

02:40:42.165 --> 02:40:45.235
AGE AND -- OF SUICIDE

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:47.537
-- -- AT THAT A SOLICITOR I

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:50.040
THINK -- THIS IS A OF

02:40:50.273 --> 02:40:51.408
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:40:51.475 --> 02:40:53.944
CONVERSATION TODAY BUT -- A

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:55.445
BROADER ONE THAN WE'VE BEEN ABLE

02:40:55.512 --> 02:40:58.181
TO -- -- -- TO GET TO

02:40:59.049 --> 02:41:01.351
IF THERE'S AN ENTIRE CONTINUUM

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:03.954
-- AND IT PROBABLY IF WE THINK

02:41:04.021 --> 02:41:06.156
ABOUT IT PROBABLY GOES ON BEYOND

02:41:06.223 --> 02:41:07.891
EVEN USE BUT WE JUST KNOW THAT

02:41:08.392 --> 02:41:09.860
WE KNOW WHAT THE IMPRESSIONABLE

02:41:09.926 --> 02:41:12.529
YEARS ARE AHEAD WE KNOW

02:41:12.596 --> 02:41:15.599
THAT TO A TERRORIST FOR EXAMPLE

02:41:16.099 --> 02:41:18.368
ARE FREQUENTLY GROOMED AT

02:41:18.435 --> 02:41:20.437
A YOUNG AGE AND WE SEE THE

02:41:20.504 --> 02:41:23.073
RESULTS -- AND AND HEADLINES

02:41:24.574 --> 02:41:26.643
SO I JUST I WANNA -- AND

02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:27.944
WE'RE COMING TO A CLOSE TO THE

02:41:28.011 --> 02:41:30.547
CONCLUSION OF -- OF OF THE

02:41:30.614 --> 02:41:31.515
HEARING I WANT TO THANK YOU

02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:33.917
ALL FOR THE INFORMATION THAT

02:41:33.984 --> 02:41:35.318
YOU'VE PROVIDED IT'S BEEN

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:37.054
FASCINATING AND HELPFUL AND

02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:40.290
USEFUL AND -- IN MANY

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:41.958
WAYS THAT I THINK GO BEYOND

02:41:42.192 --> 02:41:43.293
JUST THE CONVERSATION THAT

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.529
WE'VE HAD HERE TODAY YOU CAN

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:47.697
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:41:47.764 --> 02:41:49.199
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM I'M AND I

02:41:49.266 --> 02:41:50.534
DO WANT TO MOVE US IN A LITTLE

02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:52.436
BIT TO -- PUBLIC COMMENT YEAH

02:41:52.502 --> 02:41:53.503
JUST TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:55.072
FOR THE PUBLIC TO WIN I GUESS

02:41:55.138 --> 02:41:56.606
THE ONE THING I WANTED TO SORT

02:41:56.673 --> 02:41:58.608
OF REFLECT ON AS I LISTEN ALL

02:41:58.675 --> 02:41:59.443
THIS AND MAYBE IF ANY OF THE

02:41:59.509 --> 02:42:02.012
PANELISTS ONE RESPOND -- YES

02:42:02.079 --> 02:42:02.913
YOU KNOW IT TO ME IT'S SORT

02:42:02.979 --> 02:42:03.814
OF THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE IS

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.382
A FUNDAMENTAL TENSION BETWEEN

02:42:05.449 --> 02:42:06.850
PROFIT MOTIVATION AND WHAT IS

02:42:06.917 --> 02:42:07.818
IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE

02:42:07.884 --> 02:42:10.020
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND MENTAL

02:42:10.087 --> 02:42:11.388
WELL BEING OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

02:42:11.721 --> 02:42:13.123
AND AND THAT'S OKAY RIGHT I MEAN

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:14.224
THE COMPANIES HAVE A MANDATE IN

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:15.759
THEIR MANDATE IS TO TO MAXIMIZE

02:42:15.826 --> 02:42:16.927
PROFITS FOR SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE

02:42:16.993 --> 02:42:18.028
HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT MANDATE

02:42:18.095 --> 02:42:19.096
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT

02:42:19.162 --> 02:42:20.297
THAT IS TO PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE

02:42:20.363 --> 02:42:21.932
TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT -- IN THE

02:42:21.998 --> 02:42:23.066
BROADER INTERESTS OF SOCIETY

02:42:23.133 --> 02:42:23.767
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:42:23.834 --> 02:42:25.702
TAKING CARE OF GROUPS THAT

02:42:25.769 --> 02:42:26.570
ARE VULNERABLE AND THERE'S AN

02:42:26.636 --> 02:42:27.871
ESPECIALLY STRONG PUBLIC POLICY

02:42:27.938 --> 02:42:29.272
CASE TO PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:30.307
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

02:42:30.373 --> 02:42:31.808
ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

02:42:32.109 --> 02:42:34.544
-- WHAT'S IT WAS OBVIOUS TO

02:42:34.611 --> 02:42:36.012
ME IS THAT SOME OF THESE CHOICES

02:42:36.079 --> 02:42:37.747
ARE CLEAR TRADE OFFS BETWEEN

02:42:38.315 --> 02:42:39.549
THE PROFIT MOTIVATION FOR THE

02:42:39.616 --> 02:42:41.751
COMPANIES AND SAFETY AND HEALTH

02:42:41.818 --> 02:42:43.420
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT ALSO

02:42:43.487 --> 02:42:44.588
LISTENING SOME OF THIS IT'S NOT

02:42:44.654 --> 02:42:45.589
CLEAR TO ME THAT SOME OF THOSE

02:42:45.655 --> 02:42:46.823
THINGS REQUIRE THE COMPANIES

02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:47.991
TO SACRIFICE PROFITS I WAS

02:42:48.058 --> 02:42:49.526
LISTENING TO THE BARONESS YOU

02:42:49.593 --> 02:42:50.927
KNOW TURNING OFF THE FEATURE

02:42:50.994 --> 02:42:53.029
WHERE IN ADULTS CAN'T CONTACT A

02:42:53.096 --> 02:42:54.064
CHILD THAT THEY'RE NOT FRIENDS

02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:55.265
WITH ON INSTAGRAM I HAVE A

02:42:55.332 --> 02:42:56.533
HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.034
THAT WOULD REALLY DRAMATICALLY

02:42:58.101 --> 02:42:59.136
IMPACT THE PROFIT OF THAT

02:42:59.202 --> 02:43:00.337
COMPANY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A

02:43:00.403 --> 02:43:01.972
REALLY LONG WAY FROM CREEPING

02:43:02.038 --> 02:43:04.341
CREEPY PEOPLE AWAY FROM MY KIDS

02:43:04.407 --> 02:43:05.509
RIGHT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT

02:43:05.575 --> 02:43:06.510
SEEMS TO BE A TRADE OFF IT'S

02:43:06.576 --> 02:43:08.378
A PRETTY EASY ONE TO MAKE AND

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:09.679
I ALSO WONDER AT THE SAME TIME

02:43:09.746 --> 02:43:11.047
WHETHER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:12.182
THE COMPANIES ARE RESISTANT TO

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:13.817
OR AND INDEED ACTUALLY GOING

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:15.285
TO IMPACT THEIR PRODUCTS AND

02:43:15.352 --> 02:43:16.253
SERVICES IN THE WAY THAT THEY

02:43:16.319 --> 02:43:18.188
DO THAT I'M THINKING OF --

02:43:18.989 --> 02:43:20.790
A BIRD THAT THE LEGENDARY HENRY

02:43:20.857 --> 02:43:21.791
WAXMAN WHO CERTAINLY UNITED

02:43:21.858 --> 02:43:22.792
STATES HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES AND

02:43:22.859 --> 02:43:24.361
ALSO IN THIS BODY TALKING ABOUT

02:43:24.427 --> 02:43:25.228
WHEN THEY WERE WORK WORKING

02:43:25.295 --> 02:43:26.563
TO OUTLAW SMOKING IN BARS

02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:27.831
THERE'S INCREDIBLE RESISTANCE

02:43:28.165 --> 02:43:29.132
AND THEY SAID NO NO EVER COME

02:43:29.199 --> 02:43:30.100
TO A BAR IF YOU CAN'T SMOKE

02:43:30.167 --> 02:43:31.268
THERE IT TURNED OUT THAT THE

02:43:31.334 --> 02:43:32.602
OPPOSITE WAS TRUE RIGHT THAT IT

02:43:32.669 --> 02:43:33.837
WAS ACTUALLY BENEFITTED THEIR

02:43:33.904 --> 02:43:35.071
BUSINESSES TO DO THAT I WONDER

02:43:35.138 --> 02:43:36.606
THAT IF PARENTS YOU KNOW WITH

02:43:36.673 --> 02:43:38.041
WITH MINIMAL EFFORT FROM SOME OF

02:43:38.108 --> 02:43:39.576
THESE COMPANIES WORKING TO MAKE

02:43:39.643 --> 02:43:41.311
THEIR PRODUCTS SAFER -- IT WOULD

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:43.213
REALLY BENEFIT THOSE COMPANIES

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:44.281
AND AND PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE

02:43:44.347 --> 02:43:45.649
INCLINED TO WANT TO HAVE THEIR

02:43:45.715 --> 02:43:46.783
CHILDREN ACCESS THEM AND USE

02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:47.951
THEM FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

02:43:48.018 --> 02:43:49.719
AND ALL OF THE WONDERFUL -- I

02:43:49.786 --> 02:43:50.854
THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT AS AT

02:43:50.921 --> 02:43:52.656
PHENOMENALLY POSITIVE BENEFITS

02:43:53.356 --> 02:43:54.624
THAT THEY PROVIDE RIGHT AND I

02:43:54.691 --> 02:43:55.625
THINK ABOUT GOING BACK TO OUR

02:43:55.692 --> 02:43:56.793
KNOWLEDGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:57.928
REQUIRING A COMPANY TO HAVE

02:43:57.994 --> 02:43:59.729
A CAR SEAT FOR AN INFANT THAT

02:43:59.796 --> 02:44:01.131
DOESN'T IMPACT WHETHER OR NOT

02:44:01.198 --> 02:44:02.332
YOU CAN SELL CARS THAT DOESN'T

02:44:02.399 --> 02:44:03.400
IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF

02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:04.334
THOSE COMPANIES SO I JUST WAS

02:44:04.401 --> 02:44:05.702
WONDERING IF YOU WERE YOU KNOW

02:44:05.769 --> 02:44:06.870
COULD COMMENT ON THAT CERTAINLY

02:44:06.937 --> 02:44:07.971
THERE ARE GONNA BE CASES WHERE

02:44:08.038 --> 02:44:09.072
THAT PROFIT MOTIVATION IS

02:44:09.139 --> 02:44:10.574
INTENTION WITH DOING WHAT'S

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.508
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF YOUNG

02:44:11.575 --> 02:44:12.809
PEOPLE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S

02:44:12.876 --> 02:44:14.578
A LOT OF LOW HANGING FRUIT HERE

02:44:14.644 --> 02:44:15.745
WHERE WE COULD MAKE SOME REALLY

02:44:15.812 --> 02:44:16.913
SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO PROTECT

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:18.181
YOUNG PEOPLE AND STILL ALLOW

02:44:18.248 --> 02:44:20.016
FOR INNOVATION CREATIVITY AND

02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:21.051
ALL OF THE WONDERFUL BENEFITS

02:44:21.117 --> 02:44:22.085
OF THESE THESE PRODUCTS AND

02:44:22.152 --> 02:44:24.354
SERVICES IT'S A REALLY GREAT

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:25.922
QUESTION I THINK THE FIRST THING

02:44:25.989 --> 02:44:27.424
WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IS

02:44:27.757 --> 02:44:29.626
ARE WE PAYING A PRICE FOR THEM

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:31.861
NOT DOING IT AND I THINK IN OUR

02:44:31.928 --> 02:44:34.397
SCHOOLS AND OUR HEALTH SYSTEM IN

02:44:34.464 --> 02:44:36.499
SONG WITHOUT PAYING A PRICE YOU

02:44:36.566 --> 02:44:37.701
KNOW WHAT PAYING A SOCIAL PRICE

02:44:37.767 --> 02:44:38.735
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY PAYING OUT

02:44:39.069 --> 02:44:41.504
A COST PRICE AT BAKER BECAUSE

02:44:41.571 --> 02:44:43.707
HOMES COSTS I THINK THERE'S

02:44:43.773 --> 02:44:45.408
SOMETHING ELSE ALSO INTERESTING

02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:47.177
WHICH IS IF YOU CANNOT MAKE THE

02:44:47.244 --> 02:44:49.479
PRODUCTS SAFE YEAH BUT YOU'VE

02:44:49.546 --> 02:44:51.481
GOT A CLUTCH ON THE MARKET

02:44:51.548 --> 02:44:53.083
THAT'S MARKET FABIA BECAUSE

02:44:53.149 --> 02:44:54.784
THERE ARE A LOT OF INNOVATORS

02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:56.620
OUT THERE YOU KNOW AND START

02:44:56.686 --> 02:44:58.021
UPS WOULD LIKE TO COME INTO THIS

02:44:58.088 --> 02:45:00.257
SPACE BUT THEY CALMED BECAUSE

02:45:00.323 --> 02:45:02.092
ACTUALLY IF YOU COME TO TREAT

02:45:02.158 --> 02:45:04.094
PEOPLE WELL AND MAKE A PROFIT

02:45:04.594 --> 02:45:06.630
THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR A SOUL AND

02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:08.031
THEN FINALLY I THINK THERE IS

02:45:08.098 --> 02:45:09.666
A QUESTION OF SUSTAINABILITY

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:12.002
AND I'M NOT AND IT WAS QUITE

02:45:12.068 --> 02:45:15.305
PUBLIC YOU KNOW RECENTLY --

02:45:15.372 --> 02:45:17.040
THAT YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF

02:45:17.107 --> 02:45:18.575
YOUNG PEOPLE FOUND TO BE UNSAFE

02:45:18.642 --> 02:45:20.343
ON AND GRAHAM AND WE'RE MOVING

02:45:20.410 --> 02:45:21.611
OVER TO TAKE TALK AND THAT

02:45:21.678 --> 02:45:23.013
HAD A HIT ON THE SHARE PRICE

02:45:23.079 --> 02:45:24.748
AND SOMEONE'S ON THAT THAT

02:45:24.814 --> 02:45:26.249
IS A COMPLEX PICTURE AND I'M

02:45:26.316 --> 02:45:27.784
NOT GONNA SAY BECAUSE A FACT

02:45:28.118 --> 02:45:30.487
BUT I DO THINK IT IS WORTH

02:45:30.553 --> 02:45:32.722
LOOKING AT THE SUSTAINABILITY

02:45:32.789 --> 02:45:35.125
PIECE I THINK THAT IS A COST

02:45:35.525 --> 02:45:37.394
BUT THEN MAY ACTUALLY BE A

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:40.063
BENEFIT AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS

02:45:40.363 --> 02:45:41.798
SHORT TERM LONG TERM YOU KNOW

02:45:41.865 --> 02:45:42.966
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ALWAYS IN

02:45:43.033 --> 02:45:44.034
THE SHORT TERM I THINK IN THE

02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:46.403
LONG TERM AS A TRUST DEFICIT

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:49.306
AND YOU'RE NOT INDUSTRY WOULD

02:45:49.372 --> 02:45:52.108
REALLY BENEFIT FROM MAKING

02:45:52.175 --> 02:45:54.377
THESE CHANGES AT SOME COST

02:45:55.178 --> 02:45:57.013
THIS IS ALWAYS BAFFLED ME ABOUT

02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:58.748
THE INDUSTRY IS THAT NOT ONLY

02:45:58.815 --> 02:46:00.317
IS JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO

02:46:00.717 --> 02:46:01.885
I'M ATTACHING THE SMART THING

02:46:01.951 --> 02:46:03.820
TO DO -- AND I THINK IT IS SMART

02:46:03.887 --> 02:46:05.121
IN TERMS OF LONG TERM PROFITS

02:46:05.188 --> 02:46:06.890
INCIDENTALLY LOOK DOES ANYBODY

02:46:06.956 --> 02:46:09.059
ACTUALLY LIKE FACEBOOK I MEAN

02:46:09.125 --> 02:46:10.427
WERE YOU SAID I MEAN I DON'T USE

02:46:10.493 --> 02:46:11.561
ABOUT THE PEOPLE USE THAT BUT

02:46:11.628 --> 02:46:12.762
NOBODY REALLY THERE'S NOT A LOT

02:46:12.829 --> 02:46:14.164
OF LOVE FOR FACEBOOK FACEBOOK

02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:15.799
HAS TO PAY HIGHER THAN AVERAGE

02:46:15.865 --> 02:46:17.534
SALARIES THE COMPANY BECAUSE

02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:18.368
OF WHAT IS NOW BEING CALLED

02:46:18.435 --> 02:46:20.270
THE REPUTATION TAX PEOPLE ARE

02:46:20.337 --> 02:46:21.638
EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT THEY

02:46:21.705 --> 02:46:23.707
WORK AT FACEBOOK WHEN I WAS A

02:46:23.773 --> 02:46:25.642
A YOUNG PROFESSOR JUST STUDENTS

02:46:25.709 --> 02:46:26.810
WHO GOT A JOB AT FACEBOOK WITH

02:46:26.876 --> 02:46:28.678
TATTOO FACEBOOK ON THEIR FACE

02:46:28.745 --> 02:46:30.280
THEY WERE SO PROUD OF IT NOW

02:46:30.347 --> 02:46:31.281
THEY'RE EMBARRASSED THEY'RE

02:46:31.348 --> 02:46:32.215
EMBARRASSED TO SAY THEY WORK AT

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:34.150
FACEBOOK THAT'S HUGE PRICE THAT

02:46:34.217 --> 02:46:35.785
THEY ARE PAYING REPUTATIONAL E.

02:46:36.086 --> 02:46:37.821
SO I THINK IT IS BEEN THIS IS

02:46:37.887 --> 02:46:40.223
SORT OF WHAT WE KNOW WE DON'T

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:41.591
KNOW ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT MORE

02:46:41.658 --> 02:46:42.926
SCARED BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:43.860
ABOUT THE NEXT QUARTER IN

02:46:43.927 --> 02:46:45.362
THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING WITH

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:47.230
PROFITS GOING TO LOOK LIKE A

02:46:47.297 --> 02:46:48.932
JOKE WE NEED INCENTIVES RIGHT

02:46:48.998 --> 02:46:49.866
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED BUT

02:46:49.933 --> 02:46:51.134
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

02:46:51.434 --> 02:46:53.169
INDIA AND THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR

02:46:53.236 --> 02:46:54.404
EVERYBODY TO BE GOOD FOR KIDS

02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:55.605
TO BE GOOD FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE

02:46:55.672 --> 02:46:57.140
FOR CALIFORNIA AND WILL BE GOOD

02:46:57.207 --> 02:46:58.441
FOR THE COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE

02:46:58.508 --> 02:46:59.576
BUT WE JUST HAVE TO GET THEM

02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:01.344
OVER THAT FEAR -- THAT THEY

02:47:01.411 --> 02:47:03.079
HAVE BADLY ONE OTHER GROUP WE

02:47:03.146 --> 02:47:04.381
SHOULD TALK WITH OUR VENTURE

02:47:04.447 --> 02:47:06.282
CAPITALISTS BECAUSE THESE ARE

02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:08.551
THE ONES WHO ARE REALLY DECIDING

02:47:08.618 --> 02:47:09.886
WHICH COMPANIES MAKE AND WHICH

02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:11.521
ONES DON'T AND THEY ARE ALSO

02:47:11.588 --> 02:47:14.057
SPECTACULARLY RISK AVERSE TO

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:15.458
NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND SO

02:47:15.525 --> 02:47:16.826
THEY KEEP FINDING THE SAME

02:47:16.893 --> 02:47:18.361
