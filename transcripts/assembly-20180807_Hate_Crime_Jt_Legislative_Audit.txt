ANTI MUSLIM ANTI ISLAMIC AND ANTI SEMITIC HATE CRIMES ROSE BY AND INCIDENTS INVOLVING A PERSON'S REAL OR PERCEIVED SEXUAL ORIENTATION JUMPED NEARLY JUST THIS MORNING I OPEN UP TODAY THE BREEZE AND AS READING ABOUT THE A HATE CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED LAST WEEK -- AND TURLOCK I BELIEVE.

INCLUDING A PROFESSOR KEVIN GRISHAM JOHN REITZEL AND THAT JAMES NOLAN FROM UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. IN ADDITION -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK -- KANSEN CHU WHOSE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS MISTER MERRETT JACI WHO IS A CHAIR OF THE G. LACK UP. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY WE ARE DRIVEN BY THE FACT BEHIND EXHIBIT NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TODAY. THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE DEVASTATED BY MANY OF THESE ATTACKS AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THESE KINDS OF CRIMES. SEPT PEOPLE MORE AND THAT'S WHAT WE WROTE WHEN WE ARE WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER BRIEFS INDIA LANDMARK HE CRIME CASE OF WISCONSIN VERSES MITCHELL TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO INDEED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE FIRST TIME. I HAVE THE HONOR OF A TESTIFYING FOR THE THIS LEGISLATURE AND THINGS HAVE BEEN DE CHANGE BUT REMEMBER WE HAD BUILDING BLOCKS THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER. ESPECIALLY GERMANY A EIGHTIES AND NINETIES UNDER PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS AND THE AUDIT THAT WE SAW I JUST THIS YEAR I THINK SAYS IT OR BUILDING BLOCKS. ARE INDEED FIRM BUT WE HAVE TO COORDINATE THESE BUILDING BLOCKS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF PUTTING TOGETHER A BIT BETTER. HERE'S WHERE ARE LATEST RESEARCH SHOWS AND THAT IS FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE TOP TEN CITIES AND THIRTY EIGHT CITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES TOURS ABOUT A HOWEVER. CALIFORNIA'S INCREASE AGAIN WAS MORE AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING MULTI YEAR INCREASES. WHAT ARE SOME THE THINGS BEHIND THIS WILL LONG TERM SHIFTS WITH REGARD TO DEMOGRAPHICS ECONOMICS? AS WELL AS ANXIETY RELATED TO CHANGES THAT ARE GOING ON AND POLITICAL POLARIZATION. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SEEN CATTOLICA VENTS CAN CAUSE SPIKES. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE IN AN ERA. OF NTERNATIONAL EURO NATIONALISM -- IT'S ONE THING TO TALK ABOUT PARTICULAR ISSUES IT'S ANOTHER THING TO TALK ABOUT RELIGION RACE AND ETHNICITY. AS A BASIS FOR UP MAKING THESE POLICY DECISIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS TAKING PLACE INDEED JUST RECENTLY A CANDIDATE FOR A CALIFORNIA SENATE GOT ALMOST NINETY THOUSAND VOTES TO SING JEWS SHOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT. SORRY TO SAY THAT. SOME OF YOU A FINE THAT OPINION A MOVEMENT MANY OF PEOPLE ALL OF YOU FIND THAT WRONG -- IN ADDITION WE'VE HAD INTERFERENCE FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES. WHEN WE DID A STUDY OUR LAST YEAR WE FOUND THAT VIOLENT PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS? ARE ACTUALLY DOUBLED IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS SEVENTEEN OVER. SIXTEEN AND CHARLOTTESVILLE WAS THE BIGGEST. WHITE NATIONALIST RALLY THAT WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES. ALSO WE SEEM AN EMBOLDENED. WHITE NATIONALISM SINCE CHARLOTTESVILLE THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF IMPLOSION WITH REGARD TO THE LEADERSHIP AND THE COORDINATION THESE GROUPS BUT ARE THE UNDERLYING MESSAGES ARE STILL THERE. THESE EXTREMISTS ARE AND BY THE FACT THAT CONFIDENCE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS HAS DECLINED IN RECENT DECADES AS THIS CHART SHOWS AND I KNOW I'M GOING THROUGH THIS FAST BUT ALL POSTED TO OUR CENTERS WEBSITE. AFTER AFTER THE HEARING THIS WEEK. IN ADDITION OUR PEOPLE FEEL ANXIETY OUR LIFE EXPECTANCY UNITED STATES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES IS ON THE DECLINE AND A LOT OF THAT RESULTS FROM THINGS SUCH AS SUICIDE. AND DRUG USE. MORTGAGE SHOW YOU ABOUT INTERFERENCE FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES JUST KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE THE DARK. THE DARK -- COLUMNS THERE THAT SHOWS THAT IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION WHEN WE HAD AN EXPLOSION OF HEAT VIOLENCE. I THINK RUSSIANADVISE ON FACEBOOK [inaudible] TRIPLE. JUST IN THE MONTH BEFORE. AND HERE ARE SOME OF THE FAKE THAT BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT A REAL REPUBLICAN. OUR TWITTER FEED THIS IS A FAKE RUSSIAN TWITTER FEED. SAYING OBAMA WANTS OUR CHILDREN CONVERTED TO ISLAM HILLARY WILL CONTINUE THE MISSION. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE BY THE SAME RUSSIAN ENTITY TALKING ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE. SO AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE THERE ARE FOREIGN ENTITIES THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT VULNERABILITY. HERE'S WHAT HATE CRIMES LOOK LIKE US IN THE TOP TEN CITIES WE SEE SINCE ABOUT. TWENTY THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN NATIONALLY THOUGH HE CRIMES BOTTOMED OUT -- FOR ABOUT A QUARTER CENTURY LOW IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN I HERE'S AGAIN ANOTHER REPRESENTATION THAT WE CAN SEE THAT -- HATE CRIMES -- PEAKED AROUND A TWO THOUSAND ONE ALTHOUGH A RACIAL HATE CRIMES A HAD THOSE SURPRISES DURING THE NINETIES PARTICULARLY -- FOLLOWING SOME CATALYTIC EVENTS THAT -- EIGHTY ELDERLY SPEAKING TODAY -- THEY SAW SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ARE AN ANTI SEMITIC CONCERNS BUT WE WANT TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON IS THE VIOLENT ONES [inaudible] BUT IT'S A TRICKLING UP BUT THE ASSAULT WERE NOT UNTIL MOST RECENTLY AND WE SAW THAT WITH ANTI MUSLIM ATTACKS TO ANTI MUSLIM ATTACKS OR NOW AT A RECORD THE SHORES ASSAULTS. OR EVEN MORE SO THEM AFTER NINE ELEVEN EVEN THOUGH THE AGGREGATE NUMBER. DOES IS IT WAS NOT AS GREAT. I HATE GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES HAD RISEN AS WELL AND CALIFORNIA FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW -- HAS THE MOST HE GROUPS ACCORDING TO MY OLD COLLEAGUES AT SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THIS AS YOU ALL RIGHT. ORGANIZATIONS AND LEADERSHIP HAVE IMPLODED THERE IS STILL A VERY BIG ELASTIC POOL OF FOLKS. WHO AGREE WITH WHITE NATIONALISM ABC WASHINGTON POST? POLL OF LAST YEAR SAID THAT NOT SHE VIEWS ARE ACCEPTABLE. AS WE'VE SEEN WE'VE HAD AN INCREASE. IN HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA CITIES AND INCREASED DENSITIES TEND TO BE LARGER THAN THE OVERALL INCREASES. I AND THAT WE FIND BOTH NATIONALLY AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA HE CRIMES IN CITIES ROSE 19% ACCORDING TO OUR STUDY AND SEVENTEEN POINT 4% IN THE STATE OVERALL ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA AGING. AND AND THERE WE HAVE -- THEY'RE THEY'RE CHARGING -- IT AGAIN FOR A RACE CONTINUES TO BE THE THE THE LARGEST A COHORT. OF VICE MOTIVATIONS -- IN IN THE STATE BUT WE ALSO SEE IT'S ORIENTATION IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE RACE. CRIMES OF OR AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HALF OF THE RELIGION CRIMES OR AGAINST JEWISH PEOPLE. MOST RECENTLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THIS IS THE LATEST STUDY NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE JUST RELEASED THIS WEEK. BUT SHOWING THAT HATE CRIMES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR IN MANY OF THE MAJOR CITIES ARE ACTUALLY DE NOW BUT REMEMBER A LOT EAST COAST CITIES HAD BAD WEATHER FOR CONSTRUCTIVE SNOWSTORMS IN MARCH ALONE. AND ALSO THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INCREASE GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES. BUT LOOKING AWAY AGAIN REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD ABOUT ASSAULT. HE CRIMES IN LOS ANGELES FOR THE FIRST HAVE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU'RE NOT SEEN AS ANYWHERE ELSE THIS IS JUST OUT THIS WEEK -- WELL THE HATE CRIMES HAVE DECREASED IN LA FEE DECREASE LESS. THEN ANY OF THE CITIES THAT SHOULD HAVE SHOWN A DECREASE AND MOREOVER THE VIOLENT HATE CRIMES LOOK IN THE MIDDLE THERE. CRIMINAL THREATS ASSAULTS AGGRAVATED ASSAULT OR PULL UP AND IN THE SECOND QUARTER HATE CRIMES IN LA WENT UP. WHAT ELSE DO I WANT TO SHOW YOU LOOK AT THAT? IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAR RIGHT. THAT SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT NUMBER THAT BOX CHEN DUTCH NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS THE WORST MONTH FOR HATE CRIME IN THE COUNTRY. SINCE THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF NINE ELEVEN SHOOTING SAYING IS THE CYCLIC HOURLY THE ANNUAL CYCLIC COUNTY THAT WE SEE WITH HATE CRIMES CHANGED IT USED TO BE. THAT IT WAS MORE EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND NOW IT'S COMING LEADER PROJECT WE WHEN WE HAVE CONFLICT CONFLICTS WILL ELECTIONS. THREE DAYS AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITH THE WORST THREE DAYS FOR CALIFORNIA THE ONLY DAYS WE HAD DOUBLE DIGIT NUMBER OF HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS. AFTER THE THE LAST ELECTION SOARING SAYING IS YES IT'S NICE THEY WERE HAVING A DECLINE BUT WE MIGHT BE IN A QUIET APPEARED DURING THE EYE OF THE STORM. WE JUST DON'T KNOW. VIEW YOUR AGAIN YOU SEE THE INCREASE FROM ELECTION DAY FORWARD WE SAW SIGNIFICANT INCREASES. WELL ALMOST A TRIPLING. IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDIT. CONCLUDED LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT BEEN DOING ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY REPORT RESPOND TO THESE CRIMES AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT BUT THE COMPONENT PARTS THAT WE HAVE. OR GOOD WHAT WE DO NEED IS COORDINATION TRAINING OUTREACH. POLICIES AND LEADERSHIP SO EACH ENTITY ERA OF THIS CHAIN. KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH RESPECT TO THE REST AND THERE'S SOME KIND OF CONTINUING ABILITY TO MEET AND COORDINATE OVER TIME NOT JUST A ONE OFF AND IN PARTICULAR WHAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS TO REVOLVE WILL COMMUNITIES. THAT REALLY DO NEED THIS OUTRAGE SUCH OF THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY WHICH I WOULD HOPE MAYBE WE COULD MAKE. LAWS THAT ARE BETTER TO PROTECT THEM WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING CRIMES IN GENERAL -- AND HE CRIME AS WELL AND ALSO DO AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM A FOLKS IN THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL WHAT WE'VE SEEN NATIONALLY BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS THE BIGGEST GAP WITH RESPECT. TO UNDER REPORTING IS OFTEN WITH THOSE MOST VULNERABLE ESPECIALLY. THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME TODAY -- THIS LEGISLATURE IS SO WONDERFUL I I THINK THAT YOU WERE TAKEN TO HEART THE MESSAGE FROM. OUR PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON WHO TOLD THE TOURO SYNAGOGUE IN SEVENTEEN NINETY WE GIVE. TO BIGOTRY NO SANCTION TO PRODUCE NO WHICH EXISTENCE YOU ARE MAKING THIS HAPPEN THE MAIN THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TO UNDERSTAND THESE LAWS ARE NOT SELF EXECUTING AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. IS TAKE THOSE COMPONENT PARTS WHICH WE DO WORK TOGETHER SO WELL AND GIVE THEM A BIT OF A TUNE UP AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE HEAR FROM THE AUDITOR'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN MERIT TUCCI FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS ELAINE HOWELL IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. ACCOMPANIED BY ON MY LEFT IS KATHLEEN FULLER TEN MS FULLERTON WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT ON MY RIGHT IS NICK PHELPS MISTER PHELPS WAS ONE OF THE TEAM MEMBERS ON THE PROJECT. I'M I WILL BRIEFLY DISCUSS OUR SCOPE AND HIGH LEVEL KATHLEEN IS GOING TO GO OVER AT A HIGH LEVEL THE THE KEY FINDINGS THAT WE HAD IN THE AUDIT REPORT. MISTER PHELPS WILL BE DISCUSSING THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CURRENT STATUS AS YOU KNOW MEMBERS AFTER WE ISSUE AN AUDIT REPORT -- WE EXPECT FOLLOW UP RESPONSES FROM EACH OF THE ENTITIES THAT WE'VE AUDITED AT AT SIXTY DAY SIX MONTH AND ONE YEAR SINCE WE ISSUED THIS REPORT ON MAY THIRTY FIRST. WE HAVE RECEIVED A SIXTY DAY RESPONSE AND WE DO HAVE -- STATUS INFORMATION FOR YOU ARE WITH RESPECT TO DOJ THE LOCAL ENTITIES THAT WE VISITED AND POST OP. THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING AND MISTER PHELPS WILL GO THROUGH. AGAIN AT A HIGH LEVEL IN THE INTEREST OF TIME THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE STATUS OF THOSE THERE HAS BEEN -- PROGRESS MADE PARTICULAR. BUT AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL MISTER CHU AND MISTER LEVINE I KNOW YOU REMEMBER THE REQUEST OF MISTER RICHARDS YOU OF COURSE -- WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE THAT APPROVED THE AUDIT ASKED US TO LOOK AT DOJ WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE OR THEY PROVIDING -- WHAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT AS YOU KNOW DOJ IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ULTIMATELY WE COULD? ACCOMPLISH CONDUCTING -- AN OVERALL ANNUAL REPORT SUBMITTING THAT INFORMATION TO THE FBI SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT LOCALS REPORT CORRECT INFORMATION TO DOJ SO WE LOOKED AT WHAT IS DOJ DOING FIGHT OVERSIGHT PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO LOCALS. KEY KEY ISSUE AND THE REPORT OR KEY WORK THAT WE DID IS VISITING LOCAL ENTITIES AS YOU INDICATED MISTER CHIU WE VISITED. A LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF STANISLAUS COUNTY SHERIFF AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE MEMBERS WE WENT TO A CAMPUS POLICE AND THAT WAS SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE. OUT TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING FIRST OF ALL TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY. HATE CRIMES ARE MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE IDENTIFYING THEM APPROPRIATELY REPORTING THEM TO DOJ SO THAT THEY DO ULTIMATELY GET REPORTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE FBI AND TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON AND THEN YOU ASKED US TO ALSO SURVEY OTHER LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET A BETTER PICTURE STATEWIDE. OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO POLICIES PROCEDURES TRAINING FOR OFFICERS OUT REACH IN THE COMMUNITY THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO THAT WAS THE AND NOT SHELVE THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO -- KEY FINDINGS AND AND SEVERAL AREAS FIRST OF ALL IDENTIFICATION AND AGAIN MISS FULLER TEN WILL GO THROUGH THESE IN MORE DETAIL BUT WE FOUND PROBLEMS WITH PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF HATE CRIMES SOMEWHERE I IDENTIFIED AS AN INCIDENT RATHER THAN A CRIME SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE REPORTED. SO IMPROPER IDENTIFICATION UNDER REPORTING EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE LOCALS HAD IDENTIFIED A CRIME AS A HATE CRIME IT HAD NOT BEEN REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND AGAIN THAT DID NOT ULTIMATELY END UP IN AN ANNUAL REPORT. OR REPORTED TO THE FBI NOW IN WASHINGTON. WE LOOKED AT UP PROSECUTION RATES WE DUG VISITED OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS IN THE FOUR LOCATIONS ON THAT I TALKED ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO ORANGE. A LOS ANGELES AND STANISLAUS COUNTY -- AND TALK TO THE DA'S ABOUT THEIR PROCESS FOR PROSECUTING HATE CRIMES AND WHAT THE ISSUES WERE UP BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE PROSECUTION RIGHT THE SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION IS MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER TYPES OF FELONIES AND WE'LL HAVE SOME INFORMATION RELATED TO THAT. TWO OTHER KEY ISSUES RELATED TO THE DATABASE THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS IN ITS DATABASE PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE LOCALS. NOT REPORTING EVERYTHING -- DOJ WE BELIEVE CAN AS YOU SAID MISTER MERRETT TUCCI REALLY SHOW LEADERSHIP ARE IN THIS AREA AGAIN AND MISTER PHELPS WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND THE ACTION THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN. A WITHIN THE IF THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS AFTER WE ISSUED A REPORT AND THEN OUTREACH TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AGAIN IS A STATE DOING ANYTHING FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT CERTAINLY FOCUSED A LOT OF EFFORTS WHEN WE'RE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE LOCAL ENTITIES WHAT ARE YOU DOING. TO PROVIDE OUTREACH TO THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE. HOPEFULLY GET THEM COMFORTABLE IN COMING FORWARD AND REPORTING AN INCIDENT THAT. ULTIMATELY WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IS A HATE CRIME SO THOSE WERE THE KEY AREAS THAT WE LOOKED AT I'M I'M GONNA HAND IT OVER TO MS FULLERTON AND SHE CAN GET INTO MORE SPECIFICS ON EACH OF THE AT THE KEY AREAS. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU KATHLEEN FULLERTON STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE SO AS A SENATOR MENTIONS WE HAD SEVERAL KEY FINDINGS AND THE FIRST ONE IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT PROPERLY IDENTIFYING HE CRIMES. SO THREE OF THE FOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SEES THAT WE VISITED -- EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE WHERE THEY ARE IN FACT -- RECORDING A AN EVENT AT AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN HE CRIME THERE EITHER RECORDING AS A HEAT INCIDENT WHICH IS NOT CONSIDERED A CRIME. OR THEY ARE RECORDING INTO SOME OTHER TYPE OF CRIME. SO AT LAPD WHAT WE FOUND IS ABOUT 20% OF THE FIFTEEN CRIMES WE REVIEWED WERE INAPPROPRIATELY A CLASSIFIED AS A HEAT INCIDENT RATHER THAN A HATE CRIME. 53% OF THE FIFTEEN WE REVIEWED AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE WERE ALSO CLASSIFIED AS HEAT INCIDENTS RATHER THAN HATE CRIMES. AND THEN AT ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF WE FOUND -- ONE INSTANCE OF A CRIME THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A HATE CRIME BUT AGAIN WAS NOT. SO WE FOUND THAT THIS IS A A PERVASIVE ISSUE OF THREE OF THE FOUR ENTITIES THAT WE VISITED. AND ULTIMATELY THIS RESULTS IN THESE CRY BEING REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS HATE CRIMES AND THEREFORE UNDER REPORTING THAT THE CRIMES THAT EXISTED WITHIN THESE FLEAS THREE JURISDICTIONS. AND THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY CAUSES WE FOUND OF THIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE FIRST ONE IS INADEQUATE TOOLS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL HEAT CREDIT REPORT. AND WHAT THIS IS IS A AS A FORUM THAT PATROL OFFICERS CAN USE TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY WHAT TYPE OF EVIDENCE IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY A HATE CRIME. WHAT TYPE OF VICTIMS THEY SHOULD BE INTERVIEWING WHAT TYPE OF EVIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE GATHERING? AND WE FOUND THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL HE CRIME REPORTS WERE ONLY USED A TWO OF THE FOUR ENTITIES WE REVIEWED -- IS AN ORANGE COUNTY AND STANISLAUS DIDN'T USE THAT I THIS IS SOMETHING THAT POST RECOMMENDS IS A IS A REALLY CRITICAL TOOL TO USE. WHEN IDENTIFYING HATE CRIMES? AND THE SECOND ISSUE WE FOUND AS A CAUSE WAS INADEQUATE POLICIES SO SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY FOR EXAMPLE. WAS ARE USING INCORRECT STATUTORY DEFINITION OF HATE CRIMES IN THEIR POLICY AND AS A RESULT THEIR OFFICERS WERE NOT ABLE TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY CRIMES. AND FINALLY TRAINING -- AND PERIODIC TRAINING IS ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED OF OFFICERS IT'S ONLY REQUIRED ONE TIME AND THAT'S WHEN THAT THE POLICE OFFICER ACADEMY. AND WE FOUND THAT THIS IS AGAIN IS A BIG ISSUE NOT AT THE NOT JUST THE FOR ENTITIES WE VISITED BUT STATEWIDE. WE FOUND THAT 50% OF OUR SURVEY RESPONDENTS -- IT PROVIDED NO SORT OF PERIODIC REFRESHER TRAINING REGARDING HATE CRIMES. AS WE KNOW THESE ARE NOT STATIC ISSUES THEY REALLY REQUIRE UP TO DATE KNOWLEDGE ON WHAT'S GOING ON AND UNFORTUNATELY -- AT LEAST HALF SEE WIDER. REFRESHER TRAINING FOR THEIR OFFICER. OUR SECOND KEY FINING RELATES TO PROSECUTION AND THE BIG ISSUE THERE ARE WAS THAT PROSECUTORS ARE ONLY AVERAGING CONVICTION RATES AT ABOUT HALF THE RATE FOR HE CRIMES. THAN THEY ARE FOR ALL FELONIES OF THE STATE SETS ABOUT 46% BY THE PROSECUTION RATE FOR HATE CRIMES. VERSES 84% FOR ALL TYPES OF FELONIES -- THEY'RE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS OF A PRIMARY ONE IS PROVING MOTIVE THAT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE. A SUSPECT'S MOTIVE TO GET A HATE CRIME CONVICTION. BUT WHEN WE INTERVIEWED THE FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHAT WE FOUND WAS A LACK OF IDENTIFIABLE SUSPECTS THIS IS ABOUT 30%. OF OF HATE CRIMES ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A SUSPECT IT'S IDENTIFIED AT ALL WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO DIFFICULTY IN PROSECUTION. WE ALSO FOUND LACK OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PROSECUTORS SAID WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM. WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PROSECUTE HATE CRIMES IT IT HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE AND ACTUALLY POINTED TO WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT -- IN A BETTER WAY SUCH AS USING A SUPPLEMENTAL HE CRIME REPORT WHICH WOULD ASSIST THOSE PROSECUTORS AND HAVING BETTER EVIDENCE TO CONVICT. THOSE SUSPECTS OF HATE CRIMES. I IS A STATE ARE MENTIONED ALSO UNDER REPORTING IS A BIG ISSUE SO THIS IS AND THIS IS IN ADDITION TO IDENTIFICATION OF HATE CRIMES THIS IS HOW WELL OUR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SEES REPORTING THE HATE CRIMES THAT DO A CAR. HOW WELL ARE THEY REPORTING THOSE ISSUES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND ULTIMATELY TO THE FBI? AND WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THERE AS WELL IN PARTICULAR 14%. OF THE HATE CRIMES THAT OCCURRED IN OUR FOR JURISDICTIONS WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THE MAJORITY OF THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND AGAIN WHAT WE FOUND THERE IN TERMS OF CAUSE WAS LACK OF OVERSIGHT LACK OF ADEQUATE POLICIES -- ON AT THE LOT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LEVEL. BUT WE ALSO REALLY FELT LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COULD DO MORE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING. OUT WE REACHED OUT TO TO ALL OF THEM -- ALL OF THE FOR WE DISCUSSED WE AND THEY ALL FELT LIKE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE BY ONE FIRST OR BY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. IN FACT OVER 80% STATEWIDE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT WE SURVEYED SAID THEY WOULD LIKE MORE GUIDANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. RELATED TO REPORTING HATE CRIMES THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME CONFUSION THERE THAT COULD BE ALLEVIATED IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WERE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OUTREACH -- SO WE REALLY -- FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO PROVIDE THIS SORT OF GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEY DO HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES WITH READ RELATION TO COLLECTING ANALYZING AND REPORTING HATE CRIME STATISTICS -- AND THEY ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE ROLE IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR OUTREACH. AND SOME OF THE EVIDENCE WE REVIEWED SUGGESTS THAT OVER 50% OF HATE CRIMES ARE NOT EVEN REPORTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND TWO OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE REVIEWED SAID PROVIDING OUTREACH TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IS HELPFUL -- AND TARGETED OUTREACH IN PARTICULAR. AND SO -- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AGAIN HAS THAT ROLE WHERE THEY CAN LOOK AT P. CRIMES ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL AND PROVIDE THAT SORT OF TARGETED OUTREACH TO THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND AGAIN OVER 80% OF THEM SAID THAT THEY WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR ANALYZING WHERE THE HATE CRIMES ARE OCCURRING WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND POTENTIALLY GETTING ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR HOW THEY MIGHT BETTER ENGAGE WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES. TO ENCOURAGE MORE HATE CRIME REPORTING -- AT MISTER PHELPS IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE IN RELATION TO THIS -- AND PARTICULARLY ONCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND INCREASING THAT BITES AND OUTREACH. WE GOT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY PHELPS WITH CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. I AS A RESULT OF THIS AUDIT WE MAY TWENTY ONE RECOMMENDATIONS. SEVEN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SEVEN TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY SIX TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND SEVEN TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD SEVERAL KEY RECOMMENDATIONS -- THE FIRST WAS TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO ADD REGION SPECIFIC HATE CRIME FIELDS. TO TAKE CRIME DATABASE. OUR NEXT KEY RECOMMENDATION WAS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND IT WAS FOR THEM TO UTILIZE THOSE DATA FIELDS PROVIDE -- ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS. AND PROVIDE NOTIFICATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. I WANTED TO TAX CROSS JURISDICTIONAL IT CRIMES OCCURRING. AT THE LOCAL AGENCY LEVEL OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE FOR THE AGENCIES. TO UPDATE CERTAIN FACETS OF THEIR HATE CRIME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. AND MAKE USE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL A CRIME REPORTING FORMS RECOMMENDED BY POST. OFFER POST ITSELF WE RECOMMENDED THAT THEY PROVIDE COPIES OF THEIR HATE CRIME REFRESHER TRAINING. TWO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT THEY CERTIFY -- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WE RECENTLY RECEIVED THE SIXTY DAY FOLLOW UP RESPONSES -- FROM THE AGENCIES THAT WE AUDITED. OF THE SIX AGENCIES THAT WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO FIVE PROVIDE RESPONSES. WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE RESPONSE DEPENDING -- OTHERS RESPONSES THAT WE REVIEWED VIA. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED ONE RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATION RELATED TO THEIR HATE CRIME RAPID RESPONSE TASK SINCE. HAS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED FOR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND AS TWO RECOMMENDATIONS PENDING. AT THE LOCAL AGENCY LEVEL -- LAPD HAS INDICATED THAT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND HAS ONE RECOMMENDATION PENDING. THE STANISLAUS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE HAS NOT YET TAKEN A ACTION WITH REGARD TO A RECOMMENDATION. AND THE SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED ONE RECOMMENDATION TO UPDATE THEIR HATE CRIME POLICY AND PROCEDURES. AT HAS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION. AND FINALLY POST HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED OUR RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE THE REFRESHER HE CRAMMED TRAINING [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTION PAULA DEUS ARE LIKE ALSO RECOGNIZE US SENATOR ALLEN. JUST JOIN US SENATOR. NO YOU'RE HAVING CERTAIN THANK YOU UNLESS CHAIRMAN US SO WELL AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION YOU KNOW I I I'VE BEEN NO -- INVOLVED IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER ON THIS ISSUE OF HATE CRIMES. FOR EVER SINCE A MY COLLEGE DAYS BACK IN IN BERKELEY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BETTER YOU KNOW IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE A ONE CONSISTENT THEME -- SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SINCE MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN THIS [inaudible] THIS SIR -- ONGOING CHALLENGE OF OF OF OF OF THE REPORTING OF THE DATA AND YOU KNOW. I MEAN IT THE IT IT'D TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE UNDER REPORTING OF DATA IN ISSUE WHERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO EVEN -- HAVE SOME LEVEL OF NOT SKEPTICISM BUT EBAY BUT OF OF CAUTION IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING TRENDS OR OR OR OR HAD A DENT. IN OUR OUR OUR WE SUFFICIENTLY CONFIDENT THAT THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE. THE ACTUAL INCIDENT. IT'S REPORTED IN NO -- ARE ARE DOCUMENTED THAT THAT THEY THEY REFLECT THE OVERALL TREND LINE IN TERMS OF HATE CRIMES -- YES PLEASE. THE DATA THAT WE HAVE IS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD FOR OVERALL TREND ANALYSIS WHAT IT IS NOT GOOD AT IS LOOKING AT PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. SO WHAT WERE SEEING IS FOR INSTANCE IT IS IF WE HAD A THOUSAND RAIN BUCKETS. PLACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT HALF OF THEM WERE KICKED OVER. AND IT HAVE ANOTHER KICKED OVER OR IN A CERTAIN PART OF THE STATE. OR RELATE TO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES LIKE THE DISABLED COMMUNITY OR AS WE'VE SEEN IN IN MANY RURAL AND NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN HAD HE CRIME PROSECUTION FOR MANY MANY YEARS. THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ACCURATE BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE DATA THAT I SHOWED YOU WITH REGARD TO THE RISING HEAT CRIME BOTH NATIONALLY IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS CONFIRMED RIVER VARIETY OF DIFFERENT -- COHORTS SO THE OVERALL TRENDS -- I THINK WELL I'M WE'RE WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT. BUT WHAT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU IS THERE IS A MASSIVE UNDER REPORTING AND THAT MASSIVE AND REPORTING -- HURTS PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES MORE THAT I THE HUB CERTAIN BARRIERS SUCH AS LINGUISTIC BARRIERS OR OR OR BERRIES WITH RESPECT TO VULNERABILITIES BECAUSE OF AGE OR OR OR OR IMPAIRMENT. AND ALSO CERTAIN A CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ARE DID HAVE A IN ATTENUATED RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO OVERALL THE TRENDS -- YES I THINK -- WE CAN DISCERN THAT DID INDEED OCCUR WHAT WE'RE NOT GETTING IS FOR SOME COMMUNITIES A WE BELIEVE -- THAT GET UP THERE IS A SILENT WAVE OF HATE CRIME THAT IS JUST NOT REGISTERING INTO THE INTO THE DATA [inaudible] ALRIGHT THANK YOU AND DEATH OF FOR THE STATE AUDITOR I APPRECIATE -- YOU KNOW YOUR FOCUS ON THE REFORMS THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO TO HEARING FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS WELL AS FROM THE COMMISSION ON A PEACE OFFICER STANDS IN TRAINING -- BUT I AYE AYE ANECDOTALLY I'VE EVER HEARD OVER THE YEARS THAT THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE -- SOME IN LAW ENFORCEMENT -- YOU NO WHO -- HAVE A SOMEWHAT DISMISSIVE ATTITUDE IN TERMS OF THE ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HATE CRIMES YOU KNOW THEY THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE THEY THEY WOULD RATHER. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY THEY THEY THEY BECAME COPS YOU KNOW. TO TO GO GET THE BAD GUYS NOT TO FILL OUT A BUNCH OF FORMS AND AYE AYE IN OF THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE CONTRIBUTING. TO THE THE THE THE PROBLEM OF UNDER REPORTING -- AND AND PERHAPS REFLECTS A YOU KNOW. THE OF A CULTURAL ISSUE WITHIN THE WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THEM AVERY BE REFLECTED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH OF A PRIORITY IT IS TO UPDATE THEIR POLICIES TO PROVIDE. THE THE THE SUPPLEMENTAL FORMS RECOMMENDED BY POSTER. AN AND SO FORTH THE DID YOU ENCOUNTER ANY OF THAT -- IN IN. AND IN THE AUDIT. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE TALKED TO WERE OVERLY DISMISSIVE -- VERY ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS -- BUT THEY CERTAINLY WERE IT WASN'T A PRIORITY FOR THEM -- AND THEY REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE NUANCES OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED AND THEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE AT LEAST IN OUR IN OUR OPINION ENOUGH CONTACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO. THERE WERE SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE TIMING THAT THESE CRIMES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- THAT IN AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS A ROLE TO COLLECT ANALYZE AND REPORT ON THESE DATA IT'S REALLY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. UNDERSTANDS PRIMARILY WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND ONCE WE DISCUSSED WITH THEM ACTUALLY WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES WHERE THEY DEFINITELY WERE RECEPTIVE TO CHANGING THEM. ONE OF THE POLICIES THAT SAM CISCO STATE THEY'VE ALREADY UPDATED IT TO CHANGE IT BUT THEY WEREN'T AWARE THAT IT WAS EVEN WRONG IN THE FIRST. DID YOU MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS. HOW TO MAKE THAT THE REPORTING OF HATE CRIMES MORE FOR PRIORITY? WITH A LONG FORCE. WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFIC TO THAT IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING IT BUT WE DO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF REACHING OUT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES -- AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING TRUST WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO ENCOURAGE MORE ABOUT REPORTING -- AND AND WE DID SEE A TREND AND AND SOME OF THE AGENCIES WE WENT TO OF UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S BECOMING MORE OF A PRIORITY. IT JUST AT LEAST WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND CULTURALLY IDENTIFYING THAT IT IS A PROBLEM AND BEGINNING STRATEGOI SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF REALLY ENGAGING WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES. I I JUST THAT YOU KNOW CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT -- YOU KNOW WHY I THINK JUST LIKE CRIME RATES CAN BE -- POLITICALLY SENSITIVE -- YOU KNOW WHERE COMMUNITY MAY NOT WANT [inaudible] TO YOU KNOW -- BE IDENTIFIED AS IS IS HAVING A HIGH CRIME RATE IRVINE IN THE CASE OF HATE CRIME. THAT THERE MAY BE. THEIR RELUCTANCE TO YOU KNOW TO TO REPORT ALL OF THE INCIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES FOR FEAR THAT IT BE -- BRANDED AS A AS A RACIST OR ANTI SEMITIC OR ANTI GAY YOU KNOW WELL I HATEFUL COMMUNITY -- ANY ANY ERA. AND ANY OBSERVATIONS IN TERMS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SAY YOU [inaudible] VISITED -- COM TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. WE DIDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT AS THE CAUSE OF OF THE ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED A WE DID LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF CASES RANDOM SAMPLES A AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT THERE IS ANY SORT OF PATTERN TO CRIMES THAT WANT REPORTED. OR IT WE WE CERTAINLY WANT TOLD BY THE OFFICERS OR THAT THAT MANAGERS THAT WE REVIEW THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR THEM. OF COURSE ME JUST INTERJECT ON THAT. KNOLL BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND IN MY OF BEST PRACTICES RESEARCH WHICH IS PUBLISHED IN STANFORD LAW AND POLICY REVIEW BACK IN. NINETY THREE FOUNDED LEADERSHIP POLICY TRAINING AND COORDINATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A POLICE TO PARTS CAN BE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE A POINT PERSON. DOESN'T AND IN MANY SMALLER AGENCIES ARE DOING A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS COULD BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LIEUTENANT SOMEONE WHO'S. HAS EXPERTISE WAS TASKED WITH THAT WHO THEN HAS A CONNECTION TO THE TOP WHEN THE NYPD STARTED THE BIAS UNIT. THE PUT IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE TO THE COMMISSIONER. THAT GOT OFFICE RIGHT THERE SO WHEN YOU HAVE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP THAT SAYS THIS IS A PRIORITY CLEAR POLICIES. ACCORDING TO THE PERSON WHO'S A POINT PERSON IN EACH AGENCY AND THEN SOMEONE WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY COULD BE A MAYOR COULD BE THE FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE WHOEVER. WE FIND IT WORKING GROUPS BUT DO WELL AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE ENCOURAGED BY THE AG WHO INVITED A BUNCH OF US. TO TO MEET WITH WITH YOUR EXPERTS AND I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE CONTINUING ONGOING THING BUT AS A FORMER NYPD THIRD GENERATION. I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING. LINE OFFICES WILL RESPOND TO POLICIES AND A MESSAGE FROM THE TOP AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S MORE AMORPHOUS YOU CAN LEGISLATE QUITE A BIT YOU CAN PUT THESE POLICIES. BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE TOP SAYING THIS IS A PRIORITY AND IF YOU DON'T GET THIS RIGHT DURRELL BE CONSEQUENCES IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WE SOUGHT WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND WE SAW WITH RESPECT TO HATE CRIME RESPONSE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL. JUST TO ECHO WHAT WAS JUST SAID IS -- HELPING TO PRIORITIZE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD REACH WOULD REALLY BE AT THE SIZE IN THAT REFRESHER TRAINING COURSE THOSE COURSES OVER HALF OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE SURVEYED DON'T PROVIDE ANY SORT OF REFRESHER COURSES. SO IF THAT BECAME A REGULAR PART OF THE DAILY BUSINESS WAS -- TO INCORPORATES MOST TRAININGS IN THOSE PHILOSOPHIES FROM THE TRAINING OF THAT WOULD. HELP PRIORITIZE THOSE ISSUES FOR THEM. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M OF THANK YOU HA HIGH I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS VIA SERVER MOMENTO HATE CRIME REPORT. AS SOUNDS LIKE IS THIS SO I JUST CUT BY THE POLLS. BUT NOT A MANDATORY FOREIGN DEBT THEY HAVE TO FILL OUT AND IS REALLY UP TO DO YOU A A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHO GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD DEPRESSING TO DECIDE WHETHER? TO TO EUSTIS US TO HER MIND TO HATE NOT IT STAY LAW THAT THEY HAVE TO ORDER FROM THE DOJ. TO DICTATE THAT YOU HAVE TO FILL UP. THIS MOVE BOAT FORM IF YOU SUSPECT THAT THERE DECRYING. THE COMMITTED IT MAY. WE A HATE CRIME. YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THOUGH SOMEONE OF WARMS ARE KIND OF LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE VARIOUS AGENCIES. AND WE DID RECOMMEND LASTED POST THAT -- IMPLEMENTING THOSE FORMS IS USEFUL -- AND THAT WAS ALSO ECHOED BY THE PROSECUTORS THAT WE SPOKE TO IT SAID THEY CAN PROVIDED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND THEY CAN ASSIST FIELD OFFICERS IN GOING GATHERING INFORMATION TO THE PROSECUTOR. UNDER THEIR AND NORMAL LONGER REGULAR OF THE CRIME REPORT IS FEAR OF PLAYS VOTE TRIGGERED. THE GOOD TO USE OFTEN ADDITIONAL OF SUPERMAN WHO. WROTE HATE CRIME REPORT -- I THINK THAT TRIGGERING THAT THE USE OF THAT REPORT IS REALLY UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE OFFICE FROM THE FIELD IF IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS MAY BE A HATE CRIME THEM MAKING. TAKE THAT FORM AND WALK THROUGH THE VARIOUS PROCEDURES AND WHO I KNOW HOW THE BILL WOULD TRYING. TO ADD ANOTHER CHECKBOX OWN ON THE A INCIDENT REPORT. THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS DESCRIBING RELATE IT A HATE CRIME LATEST. AND HOPEFULLY WILL. PROVIDE -- ABOUT HER. WHO TRIGGER OR REMINDER TO THE LYING A OFFICER? TO TO HERE GOT TO THINK TWICE AND THEN TRIGGER THEM. TO FILL UP THIS OF THEM ONTO A HATE CRIME. A REPORT SO. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL WAS DREADFUL WILL I HAVE GINNI UP ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SENATOR ALLEN. WILL MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL I DON'T -- NO WE WILL NOT GO WERE HERE FROM KEVIN GARDNER TO CHIEF. CHIEF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. CALLIE EVANS SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL. THEM A NEW LOW -- OVER US JUNIOR WHO'S TAKES ACTORS DIRECTOR. AND THE COMMISSION ALL OF BUT PEACE OFFICERS. AND TRAINING POST. WHO WAS THAT -- WHO'S GOING TO OF HERS I WILL THINK YOU. ARE GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS I AM KELLY EVANS SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL HOW THE AIRBUS ERA. I'M JOINED THIS MORNING BY CHIEF KEVIN KEVIN GARDNER. CHIEF GARDENER IS THE HEAD OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WE HAVE WITH US TODAY ALISON LUNETA SHE'S ONE OF THE MANAGERS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATISTICS CENTER. AND MISS LOU DATA IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DATA THAT IS REPORTED TO DOJ BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AS WELL AS PROVIDE AN UPDATE IF YOU'D LIKE ABOUT SOME OF THE NEW EXPANDED TRAINING AN UPDATED TRAINING EFFORTS WE'VE TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE AUDIT. SO I'D I'D LIKE TO BEGIN THIS MORNING BY THANKING YOU FOR HOSTING THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT HEARING -- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SINCE HIS APPRECIATION AS WELL AND IN ADDITION TO TAKING THE CHAIRS AND THE MEMBERS. AGB SARAH WOULD LIKE TO THINK AUDITOR HOUSE THE DOLLAR HELD IN HER STAFF FOR CONDUCTING THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AUDIT. WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK ALL THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE AS WELL TODAY. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SAID THIS BEFORE BUT I IT IT'S WORTH REPEATING TODAY HE STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT. AN ATTACK ON ANY ONE OF US. IS AN ATTACK ON THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY ITS ATTACK ON THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHY ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION AND RESPONSE TO HATE CRIMES BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IS SO IMPORTANT AND IT'S SO. IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE MECHANISM. TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES KNOWING THAT THEY'LL GET AN ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WHEN THEY DO COME FORWARD. PREVENTING AND EFFECTIVELY RESPONDING TO HATE CRIMES AND BIAS IS ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING THAT ALL OF US ALL CALIFORNIANS. CAN LIVE FREELY WITHOUT FEARING THAT WILL BE TARGETED BASED ON THINGS LIKE RACE NATIONAL RATE ORIGIN ARE DISABILITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION -- ETHNICITY RELIGION OTHER FACTORS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. EIJI BAZAR BELIEVES THAT ALL OF US TOGETHER AS A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. HAVE TO STRIVE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A PLACE. THAT IS ONE OF INCLUSION AND TOLERANCE AND NOT WITHSTANDING THE DIVISIVE RHETORIC COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON DC. AND OTHER PLACES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WANTS TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. THAT HIS VIEW HAYDEN BIAS HAVE NO PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THAT -- THE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM AGREED WITH HIM ON THAT REGARD. IT AND THAT'S WHY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE HAVE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED REPORTING AGENCIES IN THE STATE. ON TO MAKE SURE THAT AS A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY THERE IS EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO HATE CRIMES. WHEN THEY DO OCCUR? HE ALSO STRONGLY ENCOURAGES PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS WHO BELIEVE THEIR VICTIMS OF HATE CRIMES WHO BELIEVE THEY MAY HAVE WITNESSED A HATE CRIME TO CONTACT THEIR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STAFF TO THE THAT TO THE COMMITTEE ASKED US TO DO WAS TO PROVIDE A DEFINITION OF HATE CRIMES BECAUSE IT'S A TERM THAT IS USED A LOT. PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ON THE SAME PAGE I THINK. THE THE AUDITOR STAFF DURING THEIR PRESENTATION MADE A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION ABOUT HATE CRIMES VERSUS HATE INCIDENTS INTO. HATE INCIDENTS AND HOW THERE'S SOME CONFUSION SOMETIMES THAT LEADS TO UNDER REPORTING. SO A HATE CRIME. A HATE CRIME IS A CRIMINAL ACT. COMMITTED AGAINST A PERSON A GROUP OR PROPERTY. MOTIVATED IN WHOLE OR EVEN JUST IN PART. BY CERTAIN ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PERSON THE GROUP OR THE PROPERTY. NOW THE LAW PROTECTS AGAINST MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HATE CRIMES. INCLUDING CRIMES COMMITTED BASED ON SOMEONE'S ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED DISABILITY [inaudible] GENDER. INCLUDING GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION [inaudible] NATIONALITY. RACE OR ETHNICITY. RELIGION. SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR ASSOCIATION WITH SOMEONE OR A GROUP THAT HAS ANY OF THESE PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL CHARACTERISTICS. SO AGAIN CRIMINAL ACTS. COMMITTED BASED IN WHOLE OR IN OR IN PART BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CHARACTERISTICS. THOSE ARE HATE CRIMES ALMOND AND THOSE ARE WHAT THE ANNUAL REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. FOCUSES ON THAT'S WHAT'S REPORTED TO THE FBI. IT ADDITION TO HATE CRIMES THEIR HATE INCIDENTS. THEIR APPARENT THEIR OFFENSIVE AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEM. BUT WHAT THEY ARE THE DEFINITION OF A HATE INCIDENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT. IS AN ACTION OR BEHAVIOR MOTIVATED BY HATE. BUT THAT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING THE LEGAL -- GENERALLY THAT'S BECAUSE IT MAY BE PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. EXAMPLES OF HATE INCIDENTS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE. NAME CALLING YOUR INSULTS. DISTRIBUTING HATE MATERIAL IN PUBLIC PLACES OR SOMEONE WHO POSTS ON HATE MATERIAL ON THEIR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY. ABSOLUTELY OFFENSIVE AND APART BEHAVIOR BUT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A CRIME. AS THE AUDITOR NOTED HOWEVER IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH. AND KNOW THAT WHEN THE WHEN THE CONDUCT DOES BECOME A CRIME SO THAT IT ROBUST INVESTIGATION IS DONE AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT. THE COMMUNITY CAN DO TO TO MAKE IT OTHER LEADERSHIP POINT THAT PROFESSOR LEVIN. I MADE A MOMENT AGO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT HATE INCIDENTS ARE NOT ONES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES EITHER. I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY DOJ COLLEAGUES TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DOJ'S SPECIFIC ROLE WITH RESPECT TO HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATE ABOUT SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES WE'VE DONE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT FINDINGS -- AND I WILL BE HAPPY ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANEL [inaudible] CHIEF. SKINNER MORNING I'M KEVIN GARDNER IN THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION WILL FORCE A FOR THE CALIFORNIA PART OF JUSTICE.

I DON'T TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AS WELL SOME OF OUR RESPONSES. TO THE AUDIT REPORT. AS THE STATE'S AS THE STATE'S CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS UNIQUE SET OF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO HATE CRIMES. UNLIKE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DEAL JAY IS NOT A FIRST RESPONDER AGENCY. WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTIFYING REPORTING RESPONDING TO HATE CRIMES?

DOJ HAS ENGAGED IN THESE ACTIVITIES AND IS MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND PROVIDE COMMUNITY RESOURCES DESPITE THE LACK OF ANY MONEY MANDATE OR FUNDING TO DO SO. WITH OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY REPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL ASSIST YOU JAMAICANS EFFORTS MORE ROBUST AND SUSTAINABLE. WE'RE WORKING ON THIS INTERNALLY AND BE DELIGHTED TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP BOOST OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HOW HATE CRIMES ARE HANDLING CALIFORNIA. ANY FISCAL YEAR.

POST DISTRIBUTED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY COPIES OF THE TRAINING DVD. INCLUDING TO TRAINING MANAGERS AT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE OF THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. I BELIEVE THE STATE AUDITOR'S PROVIDED A DVD IS PART OF A REVIEW. AND CONTENT AND THE DVD DID NOT RECEIVE ANY TYPE OF CRITICISM IN THE REPORT. I LEAVE COPIES OF THIS DVD -- WITH YOU IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN -- REVIEWING IT. AS PART OF THE RECOMMENDATION BY THE STATE AUDITOR.

THANK YOU AND NOT ONLY THINK DHEA TO THE CHAIRS ARE BRINGING US TOGETHER THAT MEETS THE ROAD COURTNEY ISSUE. AND UP AND I AM FAR LATE AT COUPLE THINGS I NEEDED TO DO -- NO PROBLEM MOST OF WHICH WAS TO TURN DOWN A COLOR IMAGE SUIT RIGHT NOW [inaudible] A BOB. AS I WAS GROWING UP -- A I HAD A COUSIN NAMED JULIUS J. U. L. I. U. S.. WHO LATER BECAME JUL JD WBO AND OF AFTER AMERICANS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE FISHING MALES WERE REPUBLIC TRAINED TO BE HOMOPHOBIC -- AND AND I WORK ON IT EVERYDAY YOU KNOW BEING HOMOPHOBIC JUST IBM ALCOHOLIC BEING A RACIST. IS LIKE DATA ONCE IT'S IN YOU'D LIKE THE INTERNET IS IS STILL THERE. AND YOU HAVE TO WORK EVERYDAY AND EVEN GROWING UP. SCREW THAT YOU YOU WERE TAUGHT THAT. IF YOU WERE. TO GET INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE THAT HAD A CHANGE. DECIDED THEY WANTED TO GO FROM ONE SEXY OTHER SPECIAL. MALE TO FEMALE. IF YOU BECAME ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED [inaudible] COM. IT WAS A TOTALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR YOU. TO THE CRAP OUT OF THE CRIME. AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES. WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT GOT INVOLVED IN THOSE INCIDENTS -- THEY WOULD JUST KIND OF LET IT GO BY THE WAYSIDE -- MY COUSIN -- WAS BEATEN IT SEVERAL TIMES AND A LOT TODD LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS COMPLICIT. IN THOSE BEATINGS -- MY COUSIN WAS A VERY VERY VERY ATTRACTIVE [inaudible] ONE AND I'VE CITIES TO SEE AROUND TOWN WITH A VERY PROMINENT MEN IN LA AND EVENTUALLY SHE WAS KILLED SODOMIZED WITH A COKE BOTTLE AND WE'VE NOT TO THIS DAY FOUND OUT WHO MURDERED HER -- AND I'M [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE. THAT IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE ACADEMY TRAINING -- I BELIEVE IT WAS POST TRAINING. SMALL P. O. S. T. [inaudible] NOT [inaudible] PEACE OFFICERS. STANDARD XIN TRAINING NOT CAPITOL PEAK PERIOD OLD PERIOD BEST PURITY PERIOD. JUST LIKE IN TRAINING DAY. ALL THE TRAINING THAT YOU CAN GET. THAT WHAT YOU GET IN THAT CAR WITH DENZEL WASHINGTON. ILL TELL YOU TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU LEARNED. IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DEAL ON THE STREET YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN WAY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU'VE EVER BEEN TAUGHT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO TO GO AHEAD AND AND DO THE DATA. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND EVERYONE'S INDIVIDUALS HEAD ESPECIALLY ALONG -- FOR POST TRAINING AND I DO MEAN SMALL P.. O. S. T. THAT GOES ON AFTER A A YOUNG OFFICER GETS ON IS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS [inaudible] THEN ANYTHING -- THAT COULD HAPPEN EVEN IN MY IN MY CITY. WHERE WE HAVE A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- WOULD VIKING TATTOOS AND AND DIFFERENT DATE SOME OF THEM DON'T BELIEVE. IT HAS CAUSED SOME RACES PROBLEM THAT HAPPENED LA COUNTY JAIL. THEY REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY BELIEVE A PART OF A CLUB OR GROUP. AND AND IN SOME OF THE EIGHT THE ABUSES THAT GO ON IN JAIL. IS BECAUSE THE CULTURE -- FEEDS INTO IT AND ACCOMMODATES WHICH DEBT HAS RAMIFICATIONS ON THE OUTSIDE. AND I KNOW EVERYONE HERE IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. STOP THAT ON BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE. AND SO I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TRAINING THAT YOU'D GIVEN WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW BUT I'M REALLY REALLY CONCERNED. ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT ROLE. IN HATE CRIMES IS NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY -- SPECIAL WITTY THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- HOW DO WE? AFTER SOMEONE GETS SOME THE BEST TRAINING IN THE WORLD AND I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE BEST LAW. A BUS TRAIN IN WORLD. HOW DO WE KEEP THAT TRAINING MOVING FORWARD? TO GET RID OF THAT IN BED IT PREJUDICE IN THEIR HEADS [inaudible] THAT [inaudible] IS REINFORCED. THROUGH PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT SANCTION. BY EITHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE CHIEF OF POLICE OR EVEN THE DEPARTMENT. BUT IT'S GOING ON ANYWAY. PERMISSIVE IN THE SYSTEM HOW DO WE GET. DID THAT AND THAT'S KIND OF MY QUESTION HOW DO WE REALLY GET. INTO STOPPING AND IN OBVIOUSLY ELITES INTO -- PEOPLE GETTING SHOT. WHO HAPPEN LOOK LOT LIKE ME? IN THE BACK [inaudible] UNARMED. AND HOW DO WE PREVENT THAT BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S FEAR. WAS FAIR BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT. THAT A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF POPULATION IS IS DANGEROUS. NO MATTER HOW LOUD THEIR SECRETIVE BUT THEY'RE DANGEROUS. AND SO IT'S OKAY. IF YOU UNDER SELF PRESERVATION BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT AND TRAINED. THAT YOU NEED. TO OP DEFEND YOURSELF. AGAINST ANY ACTIONS HOW DO WE WORK WITH [inaudible] THE DEPARTMENT. TO BRING HIM UP. TO TO A STANDARD THAT WE ALL WILL BE PROUD OF AND THAT IT DOESN'T GET UNDERMINE. BUT WHAT I DID. LAW ENFORCEMENT DA'S OF ATTORNEY GENERALS ARE DOING OR IN WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR TRAINING THAT ALL GETS [inaudible] GOES WAY. AND ONE DAY LIKE IN TRAINING DAY COULD JUST GO AWAY ONE DAY. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW. WE HAVE ANOTHER INCIDENT SO MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET TO THE ROOT OF WHAT'S GONE ON IN LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT -- I WILL ECHO SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLY ON WAS -- CONTINUE TO STUDY -- IS STARTING PLACE BUT I THINK -- AS IN ADDITION -- SOME OF THE ABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. TO INTERCEDE ERA INTERSECT WITH WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES. LAWYER AND MAYBE SOME ASSISTANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE US THE AUTHORITY OF CERTAIN INSTANCES. TO COMPEL AGENCIES TO REPORT CERTAIN THINGS TO SANCTION OF THEM WHEN THEY DON'T I THINK ONE OF THE SOME OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE REPORTING IS A LACK OF ANY ACCOUNTABILITY ARE ANY ANY ANY -- CONSEQUENCES. FOR NOT BEING TIMELY WITH THE DATA OF FOR NOT SUBMITTING THE DATA AND SO FORTH. ARM IN REGARDS. TO CULTURAL. BEHAVIORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT THE PROFESSOR THAT WAS UP A NEW. PANEL MENTIONED -- GUIDANCE FROM THE TOP OR OR OR OR OR PARDEE SETTING. AND IT FROM THE OF FROM THE TOP OF THE ORGANIZATION I THINK THAT WHEN. WE TARGET. THE LEADERS OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND AND THAT THE MESSAGE TO THAT ORGANIZATION IS A CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIOR WON'T BE TOLERATED WILL BE. DON'T WITH WHEN NECK TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS UNDERTAKEN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS I THINK THOSE STARTING PLACES -- BUT I THINK. AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS YOU MENTION WITH -- THE EXAMPLE WITH YOUR COUSIN THERE ARE SOME DEEP SEATED SOCIAL. IDEAS THAT GUY THAT COME INTO PLAY IN SOME THOSE ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED. AND I THINK THAT -- WE AS A SOCIETY RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY TRYING TO GET AT THOSE ISSUES TRY AND MAKE US. ALL BETTER -- WHETHER WE'RE LAW ENFORCERS OR ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL OR WALK OF LIFE. UP SO I THINK THAT. FOR US SOME OF THE MEDIA SYSTEMS WILL BE WOULD BE ASSISTANCE FROM. WOULD LEGISLATION THAT GOD WOULD HELP US TO COMPEL SOME OF THAT BUT IT'S IT IT'S IT'S ALSO PUT US IN A POSITION TO CONTINUE OUR REACH THAT WE USED TO DO MORE RIGOROUSLY WHEN WE HAD A A BETTER RESOURCES TO DO IT -- TO CONNECT THOSE COMMUNITIES IN THOSE LAW FORCE NATIONS WITH THEIR COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY ARE. NOT. AN OCCUPYING FORCE THAT THEY SEE PEOPLE FOR UP FOR THE FOR THE HUMANNESS AS OPPOSED. TO FOR WHAT THE ACTIVE MAY BE INVOLVED IN OR WHAT OUTPUT OF THE* PORTRAYED IN OUR SOCIETY THE MEDIA WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THAT CAUSES ONE TO LOOK AT AND OTHERS. AS OTHER AS AS SOMEONE WHO IS DANGEROUS AGAIN THERE'S BEEN MENTION ABOUT THE NATIONAL RHETORIC -- AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS PLAY INTO ITS IF THE OVERALL PSYCHE OF OF THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK AGAIN IT'S A SOCIAL ISSUE THAT WE ARE WORKING AS A AND SOCIETIES TRYING TO BETTER AB BUT I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM THAT. TO GIVE US SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO GET AT CONNECTING ARC OUR LOW FORCE NATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITIES TO GIVE US RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY TRAINING NEEDS. TO HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE IN THOSE POSITIONS TO MAKE SURE THOSE -- THAT THAT THE THINGS THAT WE WISH TO BE DONE AND THE IN THE WAY WE PLACE OUR SOCIETIES ARE DONE ORGANIZATIONS. I JUST WANT TO SAY I LOVE THE JACKET MYSELF -- I I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE CHIEF GARDENERS BOB SAID I WOULD I WOULD -- AB I THINK THE LEADERSHIP PIECE IS CRITICAL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. I HAVE HEARD SAID FROM THOSE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL. TOOLS IN ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS THE PODIUM. THE WORDS THAT ARE SAID EVERYDAY BY LEADERS WHO ARE AT THE PODIUM WHETHER TO SERGEANT LIEUTENANT CAPTAIN. CHIEF -- COMMISSIONER. THOSE THOSE THINGS MATTER AND SO I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT. WE AS A COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CERTAIN VALUES ARE BAKED INTO THE WAY THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND OUR OFFICERS ENFORCE THE LAW A RELATE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT THAT IT'S IT'S ALL CONNECTED IT CAN'T BE A ONE OFF NOT ON THIS TOPIC NOT ON ANY OF THE OTHER RELATED ISSUES IT'S ALSO ABOUT ENSURING THAT. A YOU KNOW WE DO WORK TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. ARE -- REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE -- YOU KNOW INCLUDING RACIAL IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION AND RELIGIOUS IDENTITY ON AND ON AND ON I THINK THAT'S ALSO ONE WAY TO HELP GET THIS. THERE'S THERE'S NO SINGLE ANSWER THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET BUT I THINK -- THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY IS PICKING BACKING ON THE RHETORIC POINT THE CHIEF CARTER MADE I THINK THE MORE THAT. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LEADERS LIKE YOURSELVES LEADERS LIKE THAT UP FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY. WE COUNTER THE DIVISIVE RHETORIC IT'S COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. IN THE GOLDEN STATE THIS WON'T BE TOLERATED AND THE LEADERS IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE TO TAKE EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST. IN THE END IN AN ANNUAL TRAINING PROGRAM BUT EVERY DAY OR EVERY NIGHT FROM THAT PODIUM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE AND ALSO TO REWARD. GOOD BEHAVIOR ON THE AND REPORT THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO SEE ON HOLD THOSE UP ITS VALUE. AS OUR TOP VALUES. SIR IF I MAY ALSO RESPOND ON BEHALF OPPOSED -- SO WE WE KIND OF LOOK AT THE QUESTION YOU POSE WITH TWO PRONG SOLUTION. OF THE ACADEMY AS I MENTIONED HAS THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND CADETS GOING THROUGH EACH YEAR IT. IN IT'S TRAINING ALMOST IN THE PUREST FORM IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S GOOD QUALITY TRAINING. WE ASK OURSELVES THE SAME QUESTION YOU POSE. WHAT WE DO TO ELIMINATE THAT NAM? TRAINING DAY THAT MOVIES MOMENT ONCE THEY LEAVE. THE ACADEMY SETTING IN THEY GO ON A FIELD TRAINING AND THEY'RE TOLD PAY FORGET EVERYTHING YOU JUST LEARNED AT THE ACADEMY WE'RE GONNA TELL YOU WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE ON THE STREET OR GOING TO TRAIN YOU THE RIGHT WAY. SO WE HAVE TAKEN A VERY VERY HARD LOOKING MODIFIED OUR FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE THINGS THAT. YOU JUST SPOKE ABOUT. ARM [inaudible] AND TWO IN IT TO INSTILL THAT THERE'S A A NICE PASSED THROUGH FROM THE ACADEMY INTO FIELD TRAINING THAT IT'S NOT A FORGET EVERYTHING YOU JUST LEARNED. THE OTHER COMPONENT IS WHAT MY COLLEAGUES AT DOJ JUST MENTIONED LEADERSHIP SO. AS YOU WILL SEE ALL OF OUR GUIDELINES IN OUR FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM THERE IS ALWAYS AN EXECUTIVE. MESSAGE THAT'S INSERTED INTO ALL OF THAT AS TO WHAT THAT AGENCY HAD WHAT'S. ARM IN ALL OF OUR LEADERSHIP TRAINING HIS A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN MODIFIED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND WE CONTINUE TO CHANGE. TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT. BIASES AND JUST DOING THE RIGHT THING IN BEING A PROPER CITIZEN AND A GOOD HUMAN BEING. SO IT'S LEADERSHIP AND IT'S IT'S FOR US THE FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GO AWAY [inaudible] THINK. LARRY THANK YOU SENATOR. ALLEN [inaudible] YOU HAVE [inaudible] COMMENT QUESTION. I DO SO LATER ON ASK YOU GUYS ABOUT ANY -- INTERACTIONS YOU'VE HAD WE'VE PERPETRATORS. AND ANY STORIES YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT MAYBE THIS IS MORE PROVIDE FOR THE NEXT PANEL BUT ANY STORIES YOU HAVE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO [inaudible] AND EVEN ABLE TO TURN AROUND YOU KNOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN A OF YOU KNOW I HATE CRIMES VIOLATOR. I'LL WHO HAS. SOME OUR FOREIGN THEMSELVES COME AROUND MAYBE EVEN JOINED IN SOME OF YOUR EFFORTS TO TRY. TO I WORK FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOW BLUNT FORCE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MINDSET BEHIND. HE CRIMES PERPETRATORS. I HOW TO REACH THEM HOW TO PREVENT -- THEM FROM FROM COMMITTING HATE CRIMES AGAIN [inaudible] SO VOTE. IN THEIR OWN MOSTLY IT'S BEEN -- GANG MEMBERS WHO HAVE DECIDED. TO COME INTO. PARTNERSHIP WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER. TO ADDRESS THE MEMBERS OF GANG AND BRING THEM OUT BUT I HAVE A I HAVE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- EXAMPLE OF WHAT I WAS A YOUNG POLICE OFFICER A YOUNGER OUT CAUCASIAN. KATO I MET ON A ON A ON A CALL TO HIS HOME. AND THAT THE KIDS ARE. MOHAMMED WAS GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE WAS FATHER'S OF TROUBLING TIMES IN HIS HOME CITY BECAME A KID THAT I AMID TOWARD AND THEN I PICKED UP OCCASIONALLY WITH HIS MOTHER'S PERMISSION IS A PATRICIA THE DEPARTMENT TO COME ON RIDE ALONGS AND TRIED TO TALK TO HIM. AND MENTOR HIM ALONE. AND HAS TIME WENT BY I LOST CONTACT WITH MY RAN INTO HIM AGAIN ANOTHER DAY AND HE WAS A SKINHEAD AND  <u><c.green>HAD.</c></u> HE HAD JOINED OF THE SKINHEADS AND HE HAD A DIFFERENT RESPONSE TO ME THAN IT PREVIOUSLY HAD WHEN I WAS. I TRIED TO MENTOR HIM THROUGH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS HE WAS HAVING HIS WHOLE -- I TRIED TO REACH HIM THEN AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT -- AND RECONNECT WITH HIM ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD. BEEN ABLE SPEAK WITH PRIOR -- BUT BUT AT THAT TIME A HE WAS LOST TO THAT AND SO I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T EPT UP WITH THEM AS PART NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. BUT I THINK THAT THE LARGER SITUATION AT CONNECT KIDS HOME WERE SO UNSETTLED THAT THAT HE WAS SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING TO BE APART OF AND AND THAT THAT'S WHAT HE CONNECTED WITH. I HATE TO HAVE THE EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE GOING OF THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT THAT'S NOT A SECRET PLACE MOST PRONE EXAMPLE THAT THAT HAS STUCK WITH ME THROUGH THAT WAS THAT WAS OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. AND WE THINK WE COULD AND BETTER KNOW WHAT WOULD YOU RISK ANALYSES THE FACTORS THAT WERE YOU MEANS IT'S PLAN OUT YOUR HEAD I MEAN. I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT UP WELL I SUPPOSE I HAD I MAINTAINED CONTACT WITH HIM AND HAVE MAYBE I COULD HAVE HAD SOME DIFFERENT IMPACT ON HIS LIFE BUT I THINK THAT -- IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IS MOTHER WAS GOING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME IN AND THAT. HIS FATHER WASN'T THERE IT WAS A NEW MAN BEING INTRODUCED INTO HIS LIFE AND SO FORTH AND SO I DON'T KNOW. OTHER THAN MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH HIM WHEN I COULD HAVE DONE TO TO HAVE IMPACTED HIS LIFE. MAYBE I COULD HAVE PUT HIM IN TOUCH WITH SOME SORT OF RESOURCES THAT TO WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THEM AND GOT HIM INTO SOME. POSITION WHERE HE WOULD OF OF SLIPPED INTO THE LIFE THEY SLIPPED INTO BUT I SHORT OF THAT I I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE TO ASSIST CRIME. MALE ANNOUNCING YOUR THOUGHTS. IT'S OKAY I CAN ASSESS THE NEXT PANEL [inaudible] THANK YOU. SHARE MIRACLE THREE THANK YOU. SO I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON LAWYERS -- QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE ACHIEVE A CULTURE CHANGE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY -- YEAH WHEN I WAS LISTENING. TO MISTER ALVAREZ'S TESTIMONY ABOUT THE TO R. DVD TRAINING ON ON HATE CRIMES I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE. PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE WATCHING THAT. DVD AND AND GOING THROUGH THE TRAINING OR THE PEOPLE THAT PROBABLY LEAST IN NEED. THE TRAINING AND AND THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THAT. YOU NO ARE THE MOST PROBLEMATIC THAT MAY NEED THE MOST -- IN THERE THAT THAT TRYING THE MOST WOULD BE THE LEAST LIKELY TO DID TO BE INCLINED. TO TO GO THROUGH THAT TRAINING AND SO YOU KNOW IT IT JUST RAISES THE IN THE PERENNIAL A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE TRY TO LEGISLATE CULTURE CHANGE OR HOW DO WE NO. I MEAN AS EVANS TALKED ABOUT. TO YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF OF LEADERSHIP REFLECTING THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING POLICED OR I IN AND I I THINK A CERTAIN THE PARLOR. THAT THE SOLUTION BUT I I THINK IT IS HIGHLIGHTS THE THE L. THE DIFFICULTY OF OF OF TRYING TO ENACT IN CULTURE CHANGE AND AND THAT IT'S SO ALONG AND AND THE COMPLICATED PROCESS -- BUT I WANT TO THROW OUT THIS IDEA ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW HAPPENED THEY THE CHAIR OF OUR SIMPLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE OF HERE -- I I KNOW THAT. ONE YOU NO CULTURAL SIGNAL THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES RESPOND TO IS INCREASE CRIMINAL PENALTIES. AND SO I MEAN IS THERE A SENSE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AS TO WHETHER CURRENT PENALTIES FOR HATE CRIMES WHETHER THEY'RE CRIME ITSELF FOR ANY SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS. ARE ADEQUATE IN ORDER. TO YOU KNOW MAKE. THE REPORTING AND THE PROSECUTION OF HATE CRIMES. A HIGH ENOUGH PRIORITY. THE WITH THE WAY CALIFORNIA LAW WORKS IS THAT -- THE PENALTY THAT EXISTS FOR THE BIT THAT BASED CRIME WHETHER IT'S AN ASSAULT WHETHER IT'S HOMICIDE WHETHER IT'S VANDALISM THAT'S THE PENALTY THAT ARE HATE CRIMES LAW ALLIED. AT ENHANCE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SO. I'M. YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE POLICY DECISIONS ABOUT THOSE PENALTIES FOR THE BASE CRIMES AYE I THINK. I I THINK THE KEY TO MAKING THIS A PRIORITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REALLY GOES BACK TO THE TO THE LEADERSHIP. ISSUE GOES BACK TO ACCOUNTABILITY WE AND REQUIRED WHETHER IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE WORK OR OTHER WORK IS NOT DONE APPROPRIATELY THAT THERE BE AN ACCOUNTABILITY HOPE FOR THAT I THINK -- THAT THAT WILL LIKELY PROVIDE -- MAY BE OF A MORE BENEFICIAL PATHWAY [inaudible] TO ENSURING THAT. YOU KNOW THESE CRIMES GET THE ATTENTION THAT THAT THEY DESERVE ON HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. FOR HOMICIDE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A VERY LENGTHY PENALTIES AND WHAT IF IT'S A HATE CRIME THERE ARE ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP OF THAT -- THE KEY I THINK OR AT LEAST ONE OF THE KEYS TO ENSURING PROPER PRIORITIZATION. PARTICULARLY IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PARA MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS IS TO ENSURE THAT. THE LEADERS OF THESE AGENCIES COMMUNICATE THAT MESSAGE UP POLICE OFFICERS IN MY EXPERIENCE ARE VERY VERY GOOD AT DOING WHAT THEY STE [inaudible] ARE. TOLD IS EXPECTED OF THEM AND WHERE THEY KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING THAT IT'S ALL A CONSTANT FEEDBACK LOOP. AND AND THE THE EXPECTATIONS ARE COMMUNICATED EXPLICITLY OFF FROM THE TOP AND ALSO IMPLICITLY AND POST A TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS THEY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE OFFICIAL MESSAGE MAIN IS MAINTAINED IN TERMS OF WHAT'S REQUIRED BUT I'D I DON'T KNOW WHETHER. CHANGING PENALTIES WOULD CHANGE PRIORITIES AND ENOUGH IT SELLS LIKE AGAIN GOES BACK TO LEADERSHIP POINT. AND AND AND SO. HOW WOULD WE WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO ACCOMPLISH? YOU KNOW -- IT IT TO GET LEADERSHIP AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THE REPORTING AND PROSECUTION OF HATE CRIMES I AM A PRIORITY. IF I MAY UM. I ATTEND. QUARTERLY THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION MEETING -- USUALLY ALL FIFTY EIGHT SHERIFFS ARE THERE I TEND ALSO QUARTERLY THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION MEETINGS -- I CAN SAY THAT I'VE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO HEAR -- THE TALK THEY'RE GOING ON AT THESE MEETINGS AT THAT. IT SEEMS THAT -- THAT THE LEADERS IN THE AT OUR AND OUR ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALL FORCING ORGANIZATIONS. ARE STARTING TO GET IT. THEY GET THAT THEIR THAT THE EXPECTATION OF WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE TO AS A PROFESSION -- I I REALIZE THAT TO WIN ON THEIR THAN THAT AND THAT NOT ALL OF THEIR SOME WHO GET IT MORE THAN OTHERS GET IT AND SO. I THINK OF THE OPPORTUNITY -- THAT WE HAVE TO ACT AND I CAN SAY THAT DIRECTOR ALVAREZ IS FREQUENTLY AT THOSE SAME MEETINGS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OR ACT WITH. WITH THIS GROUP AND TO IMPART -- THE REASON THAT WE GO TO THESE MEETINGS IS IS TO UPDATE THEM ON IMPORTANT ISSUES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WEARE COSTLY BANG THE FORWARD THAT. THAT THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND LIKE I SAID IT'S BEEN ENCOURAGING TO HEAR. THE THE TALK AT THESE AT THESE MEETINGS. WHERE -- THE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. IS AROUND THE SORT OF ISSUES AND AND I WOULD SAY THAT OVERWHELMINGLY -- THEY GET IT THERE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING. EXPECTED OF THEM AS A AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ISSUE -- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW LIKE ANYTHING THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE MORE TO GET MORE AND OTHERS GET IT BUT WE THINK. GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THESE MESSAGES BUT ALSO TO HAVE SOME BACKING FOR COUNT ABILITY -- WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START ALRIGHT. BOB IS. ON THE SAME ARM AND THE BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE PEOPLE IF THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE THAT CAN CHANGE LAWS SO. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR SO I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO COME AS CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY TO COME TO MY OFFICE AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO ADD. BASED ON CUSTOMER SU CHI'S SUGGESTION -- THIS SO THE OFFENDED PARTY SET THE SOUTHERN POVERTY CENTER SUIT CLAD. IN BOTH WOULD HAVE THEM ON THE RUN [inaudible] IF FINANCIALLY. IT SEEMED TO BE WORKING. VERY WELL AND SO -- IF WE COULD. PROVIDE SOME FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. TO STOP HATE CRIMES THAT THAT WE CAN LEGALLY DO IF YOU BRING THAT TO MY OFFICE WOULD LOVE. TO SEE THAT AYE -- I'VE EVEN MENTIONED. TO ON THE BLACK LIVES MATTER FOLK [inaudible] THAT [inaudible] IF. IF SOMEONE EVER BROUGHT LEGISLATION TO ME THAT IF THERE WAS A A DEPARTMENT THAT HAD A LAW ENFORCEMENT APARTMENT. THEY HAD -- EXHIBITED. COM RACIALLY MOTIVATED ACTIVITIES FOR QUITE SOMETIME THAT -- YOU SHOULD [inaudible] AND THAT THE GENERAL FUND AND BAIL THEM OUT. THAT THE MONIES COME OUT OF EVERY OFFICER IN THAT DEPARTMENT PAYCHECK. SO THAT EVERY OFFICER WILL THEN LOOK AT THE OTHER OFTEN SAY. LOOK YOU KNOW MESS WITH MY BOTTOM LINE. CUT THAT OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING IT FROM. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING DO DEPARTMENT. BUT I'D IS ONE THING ABOUT MONEY PEOPLE'S MONEY THEY DON'T YOU MESS WITH THAT MONEY. AND THAT THAT MIGHT BE ONE OBJECTIVE THAT WE MAY NEED TO PURSUE. AND HOW DO WE GO AFTER A DEPARTMENT FROM THE LEADERSHIP ON DOWN. IF THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO CHANGE MAYBE THEY'LL CHANGE. BECAUSE WE'RE NOW TAKING. BRED AFTER TABLE. SO I'M JUST PUTTING THAT OUT THERE IN. I WANT TO LET YOU CAN BRING IT TO GREW FROM GOOD NO. COAUTHORED A BILL. LARRY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE YET BUT THE PROFESSOR THAT SPOKE EARLIER TODAY TALKED ABOUT THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. TO TO TO PUSH OUT -- RACIST MESSAGES. AND IF THERE'S A WEAK POINT IN. CULTURES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE WORLD AND IN INCLUDING OUR COUNTRY IT'S IT'S RACISM. THAT -- IF FIVE WE WERE A QUILT. AND THERE IS A THREAD AND NEED IS COUPLED ON THAT RACES THREAD AND IT WOULD UNRAVEL THE ENTIRE QUILT. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PRETTY SMART OF OUR ENEMIES WHETHER IT'S RUSSIA WHERE PEOPLE JUST WANNA SO DIVISION IN OUR COUNTRY AND THIS WAS EVIL. WHAT TUG OR TALK ABOUT CODEINE HATE CRIMES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE TRENDS ARE? HOW MUCH ARE WE TRACKING WHETHER OR NOT? SOME OF THIS IS MOTIVATED BY MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE HAVE PICKED UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ISN'T SO MUCH RACISM BUT THERE'S A VERY FAMOUS -- OUR INFAMOUS -- CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT CHILD TRAFFICKING A COMET PING PONG IN WASHINGTON DC THAT ACTUALLY. RESULTED IN SOMEONE GOING TO THE PIZZA RESTAURANT A GUN -- WHO BELIEVED THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE THERE? AND KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT TYPE OF DATA ARE WE TRACKING. THERE IS NOT AN OFFICIAL REPORTING IN THAT DEATH BAKED IN OUR PART OF THE MANDATORY REPORTING FOR OUR ANNUAL. HATE CRIMES REPORT YOU KNOW AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE LIVING THEIR LIVES ONLINE OR LIVING SECRET LIVES ONLINE. ON YEAH I THINK IT'S INCREASINGLY SOMETHING THAT CAN COME INTO PLAY IN TERMS OF AN INDIVIDUAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INVESTIGATION OF PARTICULAR ACTION AND MAY PROVIDE. EVIDENCE -- IN TO INTENT OR MOTIVE -- WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE DIFFICULTY OF PROSECUTING THESE CRIMES BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. THE DOJ THAT IS CURRENTLY PART OF ANY OF THE MANDATED REPORTING THAT. THAT WE RECEIVE OFTEN ALTERNATIVE MY LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD IN TERMS OF THAT SOCIAL MEDIA TRACKING OR INFORMATION IN PARTICULAR. SO IT'S NOT MANDATED. AND PERHAPS IT'S NEW THE USE OF IT TO INCITE [inaudible] HE IT IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE PAYING MORE ATTENTION. TO AND AYE ANDERSON IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS IT GOT ATTRACT BUT IS THE SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS. TO GET INVOLVED OR FOR YOU TO TAKE COME TO US AND SAY THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT'S DRIVING CRIME AND HE CRIME IN PARTICULAR. I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY A QUESTION WORTH ASKING AND IT'S AND AS I SAID M.. WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THE EVIDENCE IN A PARTICULAR CASE LEADS IN THAT DIRECTION IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS? CONSIDERED TO BE YOU KNOW FOR ITS RELEVANCE OR MORE GOING ON THERE OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW AS A VALUE IN THIS COUNTRY IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT. TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION FREEDOM OF SPEECH ARM SO THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD BUT I THINK THAT. CERTAINLY CAN BE RELEVANT CERTAIN PLACES AND CAN -- LEAD US TO POTENTIAL AREAS OF OF DANGER OR WHERE WE NEED TO BE ALERT I DON'T HAVE SITTING HERE TODAY I DON'T HAVE. A PROPOSAL FOR YOU ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT IF ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING MIGHT MAKE SENSE OR BE HELPFUL BUT I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY A QUESTION WORTH ASKING [inaudible] YEAH. ARE A GREAT THANK YOU AYE AYE I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OWNED THE BOAT ACCOUNTABILITY. THE ORANGE COUNTY -- IS A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HOUSE NOT. RESPOND TO THIS AUDIT REPORT. AND THE DOJ THE AGE YOU PAN THE POP LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OFF THE STATE -- COULD CHOOSE SOMEHOW HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OVER DAY ORANGE COUNTY. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. ONLY IN AS MUCH AS CONTACT THEIR MAKING STRONG SUGGESTIONS THAT THE THAT THEY RESPOND TO THE AUDIT BUT I DON'T I THINK THAT THE UP. THE AUDIT GROUP WOULD HAVE MORE AUTHORITY TO TO COMPEL THE RESPONSE AND THEN WE WOULD MISS OUR AND CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE AUDITOR AUDITOR HAVE MORE. PULL TO REALLY GET THEM TO RESPOND. THEN THE TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OF THE STATE -- KILLING WISH YOU CAN ANSWER SOMETHING DIFFERENT I DON'T THINK IS WITHIN -- THE PURVIEW -- TO TO TO FOR IN THIS SENTENCE. OKAY IT AND AND HELP. ON OKAY WELL WELL WELL I AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF WE REALLY HAVE SEE. TOOK THE POWER ED AND AND ON TERRORIST SIX OR SEVEN RECOMMENDATION FULL REPEAL J.. AND TELL AYE I WILL TRY AGAIN THEN A WAS STRUCK QUICK ENOUGH TO TO TO HOLLY UP HOW MANY HAVE YOU RESPONDED OR YOU. ALTHOUGH IF SEVEN OR SIX OR SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS THERE WERE SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS AND AS OF THE AUDITOR'S TWO NOTED EARLIER. ONE OF THEM IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE -- FOR THEM ARE IMPARTIAL COMPLAINTS WERE WORKING TOWARDS COMPLETING THOSE AND THEN TO ARE STILL PENDING OTHER PENDING ONES HAVE TO DO WITH SOME. CHANGES THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE THE MATTER WHICH WE COLLECT DATA AND ALSO TIED TO NATIONAL CHANGES IN TERMS OF DATA COLLECTED BY SIMILAR AGENCIES AND HOW IT'S REPORTED. TO THE FBI THERE'S A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM COMING ONLINE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE DETAILS I CAN HAVE MY COLLEAGUE MISLEAD AT A TALK WITH RESULT THAT. CORRECT AGREE AND ALSO DE A DEFINITION OF THE HATE CRIME IS IS THAT. FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S ORDERS FROM THE EIGHTEEN DEPARTMENT YOU WERE MENTIONED ABOVE DISABILITY GENDER NATIONALITY REYES AND I SAW SO FORCE. THOSE CATEGORIES ARE FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE LEGISLATURE. LARA ALIKE TO AROUND. AND I DO LIKE. TO I SUPPOSE SOCIAL STATUS. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT -- A LOT OF FOR A HATE CRIME. WAS THERE COMMITTEE ON THE HOMELESS PEOPLE. YOU KNOW AND I OUT BETTER. SO OH OH DEFINITELY LOOK INTO. ADDING SOME DEFINITION OR OR IS H. INCLUDED. IN. BUT THAT THE ES EN ROUTE THAT WILL BE UNDER THE DID TO SENIOR OF PROTECTION. RIGHT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IMAGE -- WE'LL MOVE ON TO TODAY -- TO FIND NO. WELL HOW. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT WELL EIGHT PANELIST. WE'LL NEVER GET TO THE TABLE FIRST WILL GATHER MARTIN FOR MICROPHONE I GUESS A DAYS VERY VIALS ARE ALL IN THE HEAD OUT. SEE SOME FAMILIAR FACES. WELL HAVE ROOM [inaudible] FOR EIGHT OKAY WILL THE NAMELESS THERE'S AGENDAS NOT IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER SO. WHATEVER WALLET [inaudible] TO ARTIFICIAL [inaudible] GOJO. ALRIGHT IF YOU KNOW. MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN JUST GO DOWN THE LINE I'M NOT SURE WHAT MAKES SENSE BUT GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M JOE MICHAEL LEGISLATIVE MANAGER AT EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION THAT BRINGS THE VOICES OF ACTUAL TRANSGENDER AND QUEER PEOPLE AND ALLIES TO INSTITUTIONS OF POWER IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES STRIVING TO CREATE A WORLD THAT IS HEALTHY JUST AND FULLY EQUAL FOR ALL LGBTQ PEOPLE. SO IF YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD TODAY WE ARE ALL FACING RISING RATES OF HATE CRIMES AND BIAS MOTIVATED VIOLENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS MUSLIMS THE JEWISH COMMUNITY WOMEN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY ARE TARGETED FREQUENTLY. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE MANY INCIDENTS ARE NOT EVEN REPORTED BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMUNITIES OFTEN FEEL UNSAFE INTERACTING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND FEAR BEING IGNORED OR EVEN TARGETED BY THEM AS WELL. ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT HATE CRIME VICTIMIZATION REPORT BY THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS WHICH I THINK WAS MENTIONED EARLIER OVER HALF OF HATE CRIMES NATIONALLY GO UNREPORTED. TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO HATE CRIMES AND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY FOR A MOMENT HATE CRIMES WITH A SEXUAL ORIENTATION BIAS HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN THE SECOND MOST COMMON TYPE OF HATE CRIME IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL HATE CRIMES REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA OVER EACH OF THE PAST FOUR YEARS. CRIMES OF THE BIAS AGAINST GAY MEN IN PARTICULAR INCREASE OVER TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THEN INCREASE AN ADDITIONAL 13% BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN HATE CRIMES AGAINST TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING PEOPLE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF HATE CRIMES. BASED ON GENDER IN CALIFORNIA CONSISTENTLY SINCE THAT DATA HAS BECOME AVAILABLE FOR EXAMPLE OVER 90% OF THE HATE CRIMES BASED ON GENDER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE'RE COMMITTED AGAINST TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING PEOPLE. OF COURSE THIS INFORMATION IS BASED ONLY ON THE CRIMES THAT ARE BOTH REPORTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IDENTIFIED AS HATE CRIMES. THE AUDIT REPORT POINTED OUT ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF HATE CRIMES HAS A WEAKNESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STATE LAWS SO THE OVERALL RATES OF HATE CRIMES IN THE NUMBER SPECIFIC TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. ARE MOST LIKELY EVEN HIGHER THAN THESE REPORTS REFLECT. HATE CRIMES AND HATE VIOLENCE HAVE UNIQUE REPERCUSSIONS EXTENDING BEYOND THE INDIVIDUALS TARGETED TO OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITIES OF WHICH THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE APART. CREATING A SENSE OF ISOLATION AND VULNERABILITY TO HARM AMONG PEOPLE WITH SHARED CORE CHARACTERISTICS. CALIFORNIA'S HATE CRIME LAWS FOR THE PROVIDE PROTECTION BASED ON A PERSON'S ACTUAL ARE PRETTY PERCEIVED RACE OR ETHNICITY NATIONALITY RELIGION DISABILITY GENDER IDENTITY AND EXPRESSION AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING LEGAL RECOURSE FOR PEOPLE TARGETED Y HATE CRIMES ENUMERATING EACH OF THESE GROUPS ALSO HELPS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT OF HATE CRIMES. ON EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PART OF MORE THAN ONE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY. FOR EXAMPLE LGBTQ PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO OF COLOR FACE HIGHER RISKS OF EXPERIENCING HATE VIOLENCE. IS A MIXED IS TRUE OF LGBTQ PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO IMMIGRANTS WHO ALSO HAVE DISABILITIES. AND CONSIDERING HOW WE ADDRESS THE RECENT INCREASES AND HATE VIOLENCE WE WOULD BE WELL SERVED TO LOOK CLOSELY. HAD THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF MULTIPLE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES AND IDEAS. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LAWS STRONG AND INCLUSIVE WE AT EQUALITY CALIFORNIA KNOW THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THE INCREASE AND HATE MOTIVATED CRIMES THAT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES ARE FACING. THIS YEAR WE COSPONSORED AB NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHILIP TING WITH THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA AND MISTER ALVAREZ ACTUALLY MENTIONED THIS LAW JUST BEFORE. AND IT WILL SPARK A REVIEW OF LOCAL HATE CRIMES POLICIES SOME OF WHICH ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF DATE AND DO NOT REFLECT CURRENT PUBLIC POLICY. GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED THAT BILL INTO LAW THIS SUMMER AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR POST TO UPDATE THEIR MODEL POLICIES ON HATE CRIMES WERE ALSO ALLOCATED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THESE CHANGES WILL ENHANCE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ABILITIES TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY HATE CRIMES THROUGH BETTER POLICIES AND IMPROVE TRAINING WHICH THE AUDIT REPORT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED AS AN UNDERLYING CAUSE OF MANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS. OF OUR HATE CRIMES ENFORCEMENT STATEWIDE. WE HOPE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO UPDATE POLICIES WERE BEING BRING TRAINING UP TO DATE IN TURN. BUT WE KNOW THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS ATTENTION TO TRULY ADDRESS TAKE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING OUTREACH THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION AND THE AUDIT REPORT. WE AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO GUIDELINE FORSMAN AGENCIES IN OUR OUTREACH TO ENSURE THAT IT IS BOTH SENSITIVE AND EFFECTIVE. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POINT HOPE TO SEE THAT CONTINUE. IN ADDITION TO POLICY CHANGES THAT WOULD BETTER ADDRESS HATE VIOLENCE WE KNOW IT IS CRUCIAL FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER. AND HELP KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE. FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE AN ADVOCATE FOR ALL THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES OF WHICH LGBTQ PEOPLE ARE PART. TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD A FUTURE THAT IS SAFER FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU FIGURE. GOOD MORNING -- ITEMS SIEGEL CAN ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO STARBUCKS R. OF BY SAYING I LIKE TO THINK THAT YEARS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE INVITATION TODAY AND I THANK YOU ALL BECAUSE IT IS A PRIVILEGE. TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH SUCH GREAT ACTIVISTS AND LEADERS ON THE GROUND -- AROUND SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUES TO TAKE CRIMES. I'M HERE TODAY -- FOR THE MARGINALIZED AND FOR THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. TO UPLIFT THEIR STORIES AND TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR INTERSECTIONAL VULNERABILITIES. I'M HERE TO HOLD SPACE AND GRIEVE -- FOR THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. CALIFORNIA NOW CALLS FOR THEM TO BE BELIEVED. FOR ACCURATE REPORTING FOR THEM TO BE COUNTED. AN ACTION TAKEN ON THEIR BEHALF AND I'M HERE TO EMPLOY THIS CALL AND HOLD SPACE FOR THESE VICTIMS. HATE CRIME IS NOT A NEW IS NOT NEW FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND OTHER COMMUNITIES FOR COLOR. WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL HOW THE STORY GOES -- AYE WHOLE SPACE TODAY FOR FOLKS LIKE AND OTHERS WHO WHOSE LIFE WAS TAKEN ON JULY TWENTY SECOND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT THE MARK ARE THERE BUT BART STATION IN OAKLAND. JOHN HOW TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WHITE MALE OF WAS ARRESTED FOR ME IS MURDER AND POLICE THEN STATED OF THE COULD BLOCK WILL CONCLUDE THAT THE CRIME WAS RACIALLY MOTIVATED -- HIS FAMILY THEN ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT HE WAS MENTALLY UNFIT. AND THIS IS USUALLY WHAT THE CONVERSATION ENDS -- A A CRIME HAPPENS HE'S DECLARED MENTALLY UNFIT BY THE END OF THE CONVERSATION FAIR AND HER DEATH IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. BIG THEN THE PROBLEM CANNOT BE FULLY GRASP GIVEN THE MULTIPLE FAILURES OF AUTHORITIES AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE TO CONFRONT THE RISING TIDE OF WHITE SUPREMACY. SEX PHILIP SEXISM AND THAT A VIXEN A PHOBIA. HATE CRIMES ARE OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY THAN. THEN THE NUMBERS WOULD SUGGEST BECAUSE THE MISTAKEN ASSUMPTION THAT MENTAL ILLNESS STRESS ROAD RAGE AND OTHER FACTORS OTHER THAN HATE ARE REALLY THE ARE REALLY WHAT'S AT PLAY. MOREOVER CRIMES AGAINST BLACK WOMEN MAY BE ESPECIALLY UNDER REPORTED BECAUSE ANTI BLACK BIAS ON TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN FRAMED AS CRIMES AGAINST MEN. THE HORRIFIC ASSAULT AGAINST MIA AND OTHERS REMINDERS THAT GENDER HAS NEVER SPARED BLACK WOMEN FOR RACIAL TERRORISM. RACIAL HATRED KNOWS NO GENDER BOUNDARIES. I WE CALL TODAY ON ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO DO BETTER BY VICTIMS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. ALL WE CALL FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PROSECUTORS TO NOT PLAY HOT POTATO WITH HATE CRIMES. IN THE ROLE OF US LOCAL ACTIVISTS AND AND NONPROFITS WE'RE GOING TO KEEP SAYING THEIR NAMES ARE WE WILL GET OUT THE VOTE AND WE WILL ELECT THE RIGHT LEADERS TO KEEP THIS ISSUE OF THE FOUR PART FOUR FRONT. AND GIVE IT THIS IS SERIOUS ATTENTION THAT IT MEANS I WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. OF WE MUST WE MUST CONFRONT HEAD ON THE REALITY THAT BIAS RACISM SEXISM. HOMOPHOBIA ANTI SAID SENTENCES SOME TO THEM TRANSPHOBIA XENOPHOBIA ARE REAL AND MARGIN MARGINALIZED GROUPS THROUGH THE PRICE. FOR THE REFUSAL TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS. WE CAN NO LONGER USE MENTAL ILLNESS ROAD RAGE STRESS TWINKIES -- AND OTHER CATCHALL PHRASE IS -- FOR THE DENIAL THAT THIS HATE EXIT. POLITICS ALSO TO PREVENT US FROM IDENTIFYING AND ACTING ON THESE VERY REAL FORMS OF HATE. THANK YOU [inaudible] BIGGER KALIKA. NEXT WOULD HAVE. HELLO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME HERE AND FOR ALSO HAVING THIS HEARING MY NAME IS UNIX YES AND I AM. THE LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COORDINATOR FOR THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE NATION'S LARGEST MUSLIM SO RIGHTS GROUP AND ALSO ON THE LARGEST ADVOCATE HERE AT IN THE CAPITAL FOR THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. SO AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE PROFESSOR ACTUALLY ISLAMOPHOBIA IN HEAT INCIDENTS TOWARDS MUSLIMS HAS ACTUALLY INCREASING GOTTEN WORSE SINCE. NINE ELEVEN AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR OUR USE. RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN THE CASE OR TWELVE SYSTEM THEY'VE ACTUALLY NEVER LIVED IN A PRE NINE ELEVEN WORLD SO FOR THEM BULLYING ISLAMOPHOBIA AS A VERY REGULAR THING FOR THEM. AND JUST GOING INTO A THE NATIONAL PICTURE AND LOOKING STATEWIDE. JUST LAST JUST LAST YEAR -- THEIR THIRTY EIGHT ANTI MOSQUE INCIDENTS AND HATE CRIMES TOWARDS HOUSES OF WORSHIP. AND IN CALIFORNIA AND IN TERMS OF THE ANTI MUSLIM BIAS INCIDENTS THEIR EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE AS REPORTED BY US SORT OFTENTIMES HAPPENS IN OUR COMMUNITY IS THAT -- BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT ON THE GROUND IS EITHER THE COMMUNITY HAS A LANGUAGE BARRIER OR THERE'S JUST A LACK OF TRUST AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING OR OR FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE CASE THEY USUALLY CALL ORGANIZATION FIRST AND WE USUALLY YOU KNOW I HAVE TO CALL THE FBI ARE CALLED THE SHERIFF FOR THE LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS TO ACTUALLY COME TO THE SCENE INCOME START. TAKING EVIDENCE IN CONCERT TALKING TO THE FOLKS AND I JUST TO HIGHLIGHT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT SO -- LAST YEAR THE DAVIS MOSQUE JUST RIGHT DOWN THE STREET -- IT WAS VANDALIZE A WINDOWS ARE BROUGHT. THE DOOR AND ONE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE INCIDENT THE MOMENT WE HEARD ABOUT IT. WE WERE AT FIRST WE JUST HEARD OF THE VANDALISM SO WE WERE. ONE WE NEED FOR US WE KNEW WAS A HATE INCIDENT HOWEVER THE MOMENT WE FOUND OUT IT WAS BE THERE IS BEACON RAPPED ON THE DOOR WE ACTUALLY HAD A SIGH OF RELIEF. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHAT WE GET IS IF IT APPEARS JUST TO BE MERE VANDALISM OR SO ON INDIVIDUAL IS ASSAULTED OR ATTACKED IT WILL BE CONSIDERED JUST A OF A CRIME IT WILL IT WILL BE CONSIDERED A HATE CRIME SPECIFICALLY. SO THE MOMENT WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS BIG AND WE WERE ACTUALLY REALLY HAPPY. AND THEN WE ASK OURSELVES. IS IT PORK WEEKEND BECAUSE FOR US IT WAS IT WAS KIND OF ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE. ALTHOUGH IF IT SEEMS LIKE IT NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL FOR US THAT WE NEED TO PROVE. THAT IT'S A HATE INCIDENT FOR FOR A FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IN THANKFULLY I'M NOT THANKFULLY BUT THANKFULLY THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR THE POLICE TO CONTINUE PROSECUTING BUT OFTENTIMES O. IN WHAT HAPPENED ACTUALLY DOWN THE STREET HERE IN FLORIDA AND IS THERE WAS A MOSQUE THAT WAS. ACTUALLY TIE A SORRY THERE WAS A CURRENT ACTUALLY TIED TO THE DOOR OF THE GATES AND LIKE DESTROYED COMPLETELY. NUMBER BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER EVIDENCE BUT LAKE VANDALISM. IT WAS JUST SEEN AS A BASIC VANDALISM. SO THE COMMUNION MEMBERS ARE LIKE HAVE BEEN SCARED AND JUST WITH. THE INCREASE OF ATTACKS TOWARDS THE HOUSES OF WORSHIP WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO CONDUCT -- SAFETY TRAININGS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER TIONS AND FOR US THAT THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION WERE THANKFUL THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE STEPPED UP. HAVE ACTUALLY DONE -- LOOKED AT THE HOUSE OF WORSHIP CHO DO SAFETY -- SAFETY CHECK AND KIND OF GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE JUST THE INNER WORKINGS OF OUR MOSQUE JUST TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH SAFETY EXITS BUT FOR US ON A SOLUTION THAT'S MERELY JUST. PREPARATION FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND FOR JUST LOOKING AT OUR SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY. AND SO THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER ACTUALLY REPORTED NINE HUNDRED INCIDENTS WITHIN THE TEN DAYS FOLLOWING THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ELECTIONS A MAJORITY OF THOSE ACTUALLY OCCURRED IN SCHOOLS. SO FOR THE MUSCLE COMMUNITY ABOUT 53% OF STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY BELIEVED. AND IN TERMS OF THOSE THE SISTERS THAT CHOOSE TO WEAR THE HEAD RELIGIOUS HEADSCARF. ACTUALLY THIRTY SIX OF THEM HAVE EITHER RECEIVE VERY OFFENSIVE TOUCHING PULLING OR HAVE BEEN ATTACKS. UNFORTUNATELY THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED -- OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRACKING IT THERE A BOWLING OR POOR IS IN 200014402% OF THE RESPONDENTS. OF THE STUDENTS IN THIS IS A OF SURVEY TAKEN ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PA ON SCHOOLS -- FELT THAT AN ADULT [inaudible] LEARN THE SITUATION AS IT WAS ALL BY AN ADULT BUT ONLY THIS YEAR INTO THE ARMED TO ON SIXTEEN OUR MOST RECENT REPORT SO NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING WORSE -- AND THE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY REPORTING TO US DIRECTLY AND IN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE NO REPORTS WHATSOEVER OF BULLYING OR HATE INCIDENTS TOWARDS MUSLIM STUDENTS BUT WE HAVE THEM IN OUR REPORT. TO SHOW IN TO TALK TO THE DISTRICT AND THIS IS A VERY -- IMPORTANT ISSUE. LIKE FOR US BUT ALSO -- JUST ONE ONE AND TO NOTE AND HIGHLIGHT -- SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER. BUT THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER REPORT MOST ON HATE GROUPS HAVE INCREASED BY 197%. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN INTO THE SIXTEEN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT -- IS GETTING WORSE AND WE REALLY NEED -- AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE AUDIT BECAUSE IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND JUSTICE ISSUE A FEW THINGS THAT WE RECOMMEND THROUGH. THROUGH CARE THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO FINALLY START TACKLING THESE ISSUES IS REALLY JUST HAVING IMPLICIT BIAS TRAININGS WITHIN THE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN RECOGNIZING A BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHAT WE'VE SEEN. IS. SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT HITCHENS YOU VERY -- ISLAMOPHOBIC RHETORIC AND AND MAKE THE COMMUNITY FEEL COMFORTABLE OR JUST DON'T ANSWER CALLS. SO THAT'S ONE THING NOTHING IS A CONTINUING OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON OUR REACH SHOWED USE BECAUSE EACH. COMMUNITY IT HAS UNIQUE -- CHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO -- DIFFERENT -- MANNERS OF OUTREACH WORK. DIFFERENTLY FOR PEOPLE AND ARE MORE RECEPTIVE SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HAVE TEAM PARTNERS IN EACH WITH A SPECIALLY WHEN YOU DOING OUR REGION LA VERSUS SACRAMENTO IT'S GONNA LOOK VERY DIFFERENT. AND THEN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- IN TERMS OF GETTING FEEDBACK FOR UPDATES IN LIKE POST TRAININGS OR ANY SORT OF TRAININGS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. THE OUR REACH THAT'S DONE TO THE COMMUTERS AND BRINGING THEM IN TO GET FEEDBACK IS ACTUALLY ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE MUSCLE COMMUNITY IS A LOT OF WORK. MUST SOME EXPERTS. THEY'VE BEEN CALLED ARE ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO WHO WON HAVE NO CONTACT WITH THEM OF SOME TO YOU WHATSOEVER AND ACTUALLY PRESENT ISLAMOPHOBIC MATERIAL THEMSELVES SO THAT'S ONE IMPORTANT THING THAT WE CAUTION BUT ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF IS THE RIGHT ORGANIZATION AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. CONTACTED. AND LASTLY IS JUST THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WHO ARE ACTUALLY IS OF THE ORGANIZATIONS TO BE VERY MINDFUL THEIR PUBLIC. BECAUSE THAT OFTENTIMES WILL LEAD TO DISTRUST OF THE COMMUNITY OF THEIR HEARING SUPPORTER OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL OR JUST IN GENERAL VERY. I'M XENOPHOBIC COMMENTS -- THAT MEANS A LOT SIXTEEN XP LISTENS THANK YOU. MURRAY THINK YOU'RE VERY MUCH A MISCONCEIVED ALSO. APPRECIATE YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU AND NEXT TO HELP. BREAK. CHEERS GREG YEAH THANK YOU I'M GLAD TO HEAR OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE OF THE ART CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE STATE'S OLDEST AND LARGEST. ADVOCACY GROUP SPEAKING FOR THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AT ALL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES -- WE ALSO WERE HAS MENTIONED THE ON THOSE TWO SPONSORED MISTER TANGS BILL THIS YEAR TO UPGRADE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT HEALTHCARE POLICY THAT. PERSONALLY -- MY BIOGRAPHY I WAS. I WROTE A DRAFT [inaudible] LAW FOR Q. WHO AUTHORED. WE TELL YOU START. NINE YEARS AGO SIX CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS WORKING THE SWING SHIFT AT THE VALLEY VIEW SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN YOUR PATH. WERE MAD AT THE NIGHT SHIFT FOR SOME REASON. AND WANTED TO TEACH THEM A LESSON. SO. THEY POUNDS SEVEN WOMEN RESIDENTS AGED SEVENTY NINE THROUGH. NINETY THREE WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE DEMENTIA. EACH OF THE WOMEN ALSO HAD OTHER DISABILITIES INCLUDING ANXIETY DEPRESSION PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND SEIZURE DISORDERS. EACH OF THE WOMEN WAS TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON STAFF FOR ALL THE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING INCLUDING RATING AND PERSONAL HYGIENE. ONE OF THE CIA'S WENT WELL A LICENSED STAFF MEMBER AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL VITAMIN A IN THE OIL SO THAT THEY COULD. QUOTE. LATHER UP TO RESIDENTS TO MAKE THEM SLIPPERY FOR THE NIGHT STAFF [inaudible] CLOSE QUOTE. THE LICENSE STAFF MEMBER A PAIR EVIDENTLY COMPLIED WITH THE REQUEST. THE SIX CMA'S THEM GOT THE SEVEN WOMEN OUT OF BED. DEFLATED -- NINE THEY STRIPPED THEM NAKED. THEY APPLIED LARGER AMOUNTS OF THE ARGUMENT TO THEIR HANDS FEET ARMS LEGS AND TORSOS. AND RETURNED THEM TO BED FOR THE NIGHT STAFF. TO FIND. WITH WOMEN'S BODIES COVERED WITH THIS SLIPPERY OIL IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE NIGHT STAFF. TO ASSURE THEIR SAFETY TURNING A MOVEMENT SO THE NIGHT STAFF WOKE THE WOMEN UP. GET THEM OUT OF BED GAVE THEM SHOWERS ALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THE NIGHT SHIFT WORKERS REPORTED THIS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. STATE INVESTIGATORS CONFIRMED REPORTS THEY INTERVIEWED THE OF THE PERPETRATORS TO ADMIT IT SOME DEAD ANYWAY. I WIN THE IN THE INVESTIGATORS TRY TO INTERVIEW THE VICTIMS. THEY FOUND THEM TO BE LARGELY OR TOTALLY NON COMMUNICATIVE WITH NO INDICATION OF WHETHER THEY'RE AND RESPONSIVENESS WAS CAUSED ENTIRELY. BY A BY A PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. OR PARTLY BY WHAT THE STATE CITATION. ONE DRYLY CALLED. SIGNIFICANT HUMILIATION IN DIGNITY ANXIETY OR OTHER EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. BECAUSE BY THE*. THE SIX TEENAGERS WERE CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANORS. THERE'S NO INDICATION IN THE RECORD. THAT THE POLICE. THE DA OR ANYONE ELSE EVEN THOUGHT OF CHARGING THE PERPETRATORS WITH A CRIME. WHICH WOULD HAVE. RAISED THE MISDEMEANORS TO FELONIES. I POINTEDLY -- NOTED THAT THE CRIMINALS IN THIS CASE WHERE SHE HAS BECAUSE SEEING A UNLIKE MOST PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS. ARE NOT ALWAYS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. I'VE ANY -- LESLIE HERE IS A PERSON CARRYING A BILL TO CORRECT THAT LOOPHOLE THAT NEXT YEAR WE MIGHT BE ABSENT SPONSOR INMIGRANTE. UNIVERSITY RESEARCH SUPPORTS OUR BELIEF THAT THIS SORT OF CRIME AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. INCLUDING DISABILITIES CAUSED BY AGING. AND OUGHT OFTEN COMMITTED BY CARE. AND OFTEN WITH WHAT. WHAT UNIVERSITY RESEARCHER CALLED? EXTRAORDINARY ACTS OF SADISM IS COMMON. THESE CRIMES ARE GROSSLY UNDER REPORTED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WHEN REPORTED OFFICERS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY OVERLOOK THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY ARE HATE CRIMES. IN THE U. K. CASE. THAT. LEAVE THE CRIMINALS WORK AND ARRESTED AND CONVICTED OF SOMETHING. TOO OFTEN OFFICERS OVERLOOK THESE CRIMES AS THESE ACCESS CRIMES AT ALL AND REFER THEM TO CIVIL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF STATISTICS TODAY BUT I I DO HAVE TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE THAT ARE SPECIFIC CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING. DISABILITY BECAUSE I AGING ATTENTION NATIONALLY BEAT. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE SUBJECT OF VIOLENT CRIME AT ABOUT TWICE. THE RATE OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC POPULATION. THE SUBJECT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. ABOUT FOUR TIMES GENERATE. AND THESE ARE CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES. ACCORDING TO ONE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA REPORT. THEIR TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES AB MOTIVATIONS FOR THE SCRAPS. ONE CATEGORY IS THE PERCEPTION OF PEOPLE THOSE WITH DISABILITIES ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE. THIS MAY THEY THESE MAY OR MAY NOT BE HATE CRIMES DEPENDING ON THE FACTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE [inaudible] OTHER CATEGORY. A MOTIVATION IS PURE BY US SPECIFICALLY. HOSTILITY TO PERSONS WHO ROWS FEAR OR GUILT. FEAR OF PERSONS WHOSE VISIBLE TRAITS MAY BE DISTURBING TO OTHERS. RESENTMENT OF THOSE WHO NEED RECEIVE HER AND INCREASINGLY DEMAND ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATIONS. OR A PERCEPTION THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE INFERIOR. AND THEREFORE DESERVING VICTIMS. THESE ARE HATE CRIMES EVERYONE OF THOSE DESCRIBED AS ACRE. I KNOW THAT IN THE UK CASE THE CRIMINAL ACTION EVEN WITHOUT ANY OTHER EVIDENCE. WOULD HAVE BEEN STRONG EVIDENCE IN COURT THAT THE SIENESE WERE MOTIVATED BY THE LAST OF THOSE THAT LIST OF ABUSES TREATIES WOMEN'S AS WITH DISABILITIES AS INFERIOR. ALMOST SUB HUMAN. TO BE USED AS OBJECTS AS FAIR GAME. TO GET EVEN WITH THEIR DAY CHEF WHAT WITH ARAB NIGHT SHIFT COLLEAGUES. IF IF THE POLICE HAD INVESTIGATED FURTHER THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE FOUND FURTHER EVIDENCE OF BIAS BUT EVEN WITHOUT THAT. THE THERE WAS A THERE MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEEN ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVINCE A JURY THAT THESE. THAT THIS WAS BIASED MOTIVATION OF THEIR HATE CRIMES THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT TO REPORT TO THE STATE. LET ME ADD HERE THAT. WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT REPORTING THIS IS NOT JUST A STATISTICAL. PROBLEM THAT THAT THE MUNICIPAL PROBLEM THAT TO THE WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS. IT'S ALSO A PROBLEM ON THE GROUND IN CASES LIKE THIS THAT IF POLICE THEM DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT A HATE CRIME THE PERSON THE PERPETRATORS DON'T GET PROSECUTED -- ALTHOUGH THAT. OF FOR ALL HATE CRIMES THIS IS ONLY CRIMES NOT JUST AND HAD THIS BILL HE CRIMES THE TERM HE CRIME IS A BIT MISLEADING. TO BE A CRIME A CRIME MOST REMOTE AS YOU HEARD MUST BE MOTIVATED. NOT NECESSARILY BY HATE BUT BY BIAS. ANY BIAS AGAINST A PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC. THE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION THAT LIST MOTIVATIONS BEYOND HATE OR ANIMOSITY. THAT DEPENDING ON THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE MAY MAKE A CRIME HATE CRIMES. THE AGES LIST OF THESE BY HIS MOTIVATIONS IS. RESENTMENT REVULSION CONTEMPT UNREASONABLE FEAR PARANOIA CALLOUSNESS. THRILL SEEKING DESIRE FOR SOCIAL DOMINANCE OR DESIRE TO FOR SOCIAL BONDING WITH ONE'S OWN KIND [inaudible] CLOSE QUOTE. AT AGES OPINION ADDS THAT THIS IS NOT EVERY COOK EXHAUSTIVE LIST. THIS PARTIAL IS IMPORTANT FOR ARRESTING AND CONVICTING THOSE WHO COMMIT ANTI DISABILITY HATE CRIMES AND THOSE WHO COMMIT ALL HATE CRIMES AND TO THE THE AUTOBLOG PERHAPS. NOT ONLY GAVE IT A DISABILITY CRIMES ALL ALL THE CRIMES OFTEN DON'T RECOGNIZE SOME OF THESE AS INDICATORS EVIDENCE OF A CRIME. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT WERE NATIONALLY REPORTED [inaudible] SEVENTY THREE ANTI DISABILITY HATE CRIMES TO THE FBI. SEVENTY THREE THAT SAME YEAR US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SURVEY ADDICTIVENESS FOR THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS [inaudible] COUNTED ABOUT. FORTY THOUSAND PER YEAR [inaudible] HOUSE AREA. FORTY THOUSAND VICTIMS OF ANTI DISABILITY HATE CRIMES PER YEAR. SEVENTY THREE OF THEM REPORTED [inaudible] BUT POLICE. I THINK WE CAN BE REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THERE WERE NO PROSECUTIONS AND MANY BEYOND THE SEVENTY THREE IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE IF EVEN THAT MANY. THE SAME YEAR IN CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN LAST YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REPORTED JUST. FOR FOR ANTI DISABILITY CRIMES IN THE WHOLE STATE LAST YEAR AND FOR AND FOR THE YEAR BEFORE. I I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO OUR DETAILED POLICIES RESTRICTIONS OF THIS PROBABLY ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME. FORM FOR THAT LITTLE DETAIL ANYWAY I WILL SAY THAT WE SUPPORT ALL OF THE EIGHT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. AND SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT BEEN MADE BY -- DOJ STAFF HERE. AND WE ASK. THAT THAT -- IN CARRYING THOSE OUT THAT WOULD BE SPECIAL ATTENTION PAID TO HATE CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SPECIAL LACK OF ATTENTION UPHILL INCLUDING TODAY. OUR PRIMARY PLEASE TODAY IS TO ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT SARAH. MISTER ATTORNEY GENERAL IF YOU'RE LISTENING. WE NEED YOUR LEADERSHIP WE NEED YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP WE NEED YOUR INCREASED LEADERSHIP. THERE ARE. THIRTY NINE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE OF THE POSITION. TO LEAD THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAS BEEN AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY LEAD THE PUBLIC AND THE SPONSOR LEGISLATION OFFENSE OR WE HOPE WILL BE A COMP. THE PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION NEXT YEAR IS LARGELY. AND WE ASK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL THE CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS NOT JUST US. AND THE DISABILITY GROUPS. WE BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT OUR BUSINESS. SPECIFICALLY DISABILITIES BUTTON PERHAPS SOMEWHAT TRUE ABOUT THE OTHER HATE CRIMES OF HATE CRIMES. TO WITHOUT OUR EXPERTISE. AND WITHOUT OUR ADVOCACY. WE BELIEVE LITTLE OR NOTHING WILL CHANGE. YOU'RE VERY SECULAR MUCH OF THIS THROUGH THE SURE. AND NEXT WILL -- OF ANDREW ANDREW MEDINA HOT HIGH EDGE MEDINA AYE COMPANY POLICY MANAGER FOR ASIAN ACTED AS NURSES CALIFORNIA IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. THAT AND JUST AS ASIAN LAW CAUCUS ATTEMPT IS GOING AGAINST INJUSTICE ANALYSTS WELL IT'S ALL RIGHTS AND A LEGAL CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP THAT SEEMS THAT. ASIAN AMERICAN IT WINDS HAVE GONE TO COMMUNITY SAID AMY SPECULATING. I LOOK AT THINK CHAIRS AYE CHIU MURATSUCHI FROM OF IN THIS WORK FAR ESPECIALLY FOR STAFF -- FOR ORGANIZING THIS AND DOING THE BACKGROUND WORK -- ANOTHER LIFE I STOPPED RESOLUTIONS FOR THAN SOMEONE PROJECT CHIU WHO HAD MOVED TO HE COMES AWARENESS I RESOLUTION AS WELL AS I'VE HEARINGS AS CHAIR. OF SILICON IN HATE CRIMES SPOCK AND I OWE -- FOUR OH FIVE HAVE VERY VIVID MEMORY I HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE -- WE WERE WITH THE FAMILY OF JOSEPH LEóN TO SHARE THE STORY OF JOSEPH WHO WAS KILLED. AND BY ABOUT A WHITE SEPARATIST LOS ANGELES BY SHOOTING IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE I THE STATE SHOOTING WHERE THE KILLER SHOT AND WOUNDED -- FIVE JEWISH YOUTH -- I BRING A LOOK BACK TO THOSE DAYS I BECAUSE WE PATH FOR TODAY AND HER SOUL OF CHALLENGE RIGHT.

AND ONE CASE IN WASHINGTON WHERE ALLEGEDLY AT THE ILLEGAL ABOUT YOUR COUNTRY WAS ALSO YELLED ACHIEVED IN A MONTHS AND SEVERE CASES OF THE SHOOTING OF A COUPLE OF THE TEMPLE IN WISCONSIN JOHNSON. TWELVE AND GOING TO CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THERE'S ACTUALLY IT'S IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA -- WERE SEEKING AND WAS STRIDING HAD ALTERED. AND KEPT DRIVING STOP AND IT WAS ATTACKED AND BEATEN REALLY THROUGH HIS CAR WINDOW HAD HIS TURBAN RIPPED OFF AND PART OF HIS HAIR CUT OFF -- PACKED HEARING -- WHERE TWO ASSAILANTS -- WERE CHARGED WITH A FELONY AND I HATE CRIME HACKNEY -- I DID WANT TO MENTION A QUOTE FROM AND A SURVIVOR WHO IT SAID TO RECOGNITION OF THE ATTACK AS A HATE CRIME. AS A HARM TO MY DIGNITY AND MY ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS. I THINK THIS SPEAKS LOUDLY IN TERMS OF TO IMPACTS OF HATE CRIMES FOR COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF HOW SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL CLIENT BUT DEATH AND PACK FOR A LARGER COMMUNITY -- LOOKING AT SERVE I KNOW WE WE'VE TALKED THEIR LIVES TO STICKS AND LOOKING AT MAYBE SOME MORE LOCALLY. AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY RELATIONS COMMISSION AND RELEASE IT'S I TWO THOUSAND FIVE HIT HE COMES UPON -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THAT'S OWES ONE INDICATOR FOR MY LOCAL PHILLY IN TERMS OF CONCERNS ABOUT AN INCREASE CHAINED UP HATE CRIMES. AND THIS WAS A SEVEN YEAR DOWNWARD TREND IN LOS ANGELES AND THE SUPPORT REPORTED A 24% INCREASE IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOLLOW REPORTED ON SIXTEEN IT WAS SORT OF A SORT SOMEWHERE PLATEAU -- BUT STILL HAD A SIMILAR HIGHER NUMBERS THAN PREVIOUS YEARS -- INTO TWO THOUSAND FEET YOUR POINTED IT SHOWN INCREASE OF HATE CRIMES ASIAN AMERICANS -- CLEARLY -- FOR PERSONS OF CHINESE DESCENT AND TO WE DO HAVE A SENSE AYE LOBBYISTS ARE TIED TO THE STEREOTYPES OF OF FOLKS BEING -- FOREIGN I'M NOT -- BUT THERE'S ALSO LARGE CONCERNS ABOUT UNDER REPORTING SPECIAL FOR A IN ITS PICK COMMUNITY WHERE YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. LANGUAGE ACCESS ON FEAR -- AND GOVERNMENT WHETHER YOU HAVE STATUS -- THINKING THAT IF YOUR PARTNER THING IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT AND SO WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. SO AS A RESULT ASIAN RECOGNIZING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA PARTNER FOR AFFILIATES TO CREATE. A WEBSITE STAND AGAINST FUTURE DOT ORG TO HELP SHOCKING HAVE FOLKS WHO GOOD WEBSITE HAS AYE DIFFERENT TRANSLATIONS AND TO BE ABLE TO REPORT. AS SORT OF LOOKING NEED REPORTING SYSTEM AND I'D BE MINDFUL THAT THIS ISN'T BEING APART PLACE AND ALSO FOR FOLKS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT DO LIKE TO REPORT -- S. FOLKS YOU KNOW HAD MENTIONED AND THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT. HATE CRIMES INCREASING WHEN WE HAVE INCIDENTS OF TERRORISM THAT'S YOU KNOW. THAT COULD FEED IT ISLAMOPHOBIA ARE INSTANCES WHERE OUR POLITICAL LEADERS ARE USING REALLY HATEFUL RHETORIC -- IT IS ESPECIALLY BASHING FOREIGN ENTITIES SWEATY KIND OF TIRE COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF THOSE FOREIGN ENTITIES -- YOU KNOW GOING TO RECOMMENDATIONS YOU KNOW I LOOK AT OUR MERCY CHEAT WITH SOMEONE UBER MERCY SHE'S SEEN EARLY ABOUT LIKE THESE CULTURE DIFFERENCES HOW DO WE TALKED AND AND MY MY THING IT'S GOING TO FOCUS MOSTLY ABOUT. HOW CAN WE SERVE ADDRESSES IN THE SCHOOL SETTING SINCE AND WE HAD TALKED EARLIER ABOUT HOW A LOT OF THESE INCIDENTS ACTUALLY HAPPENING GRADE SCHOOL -- AND THE SCHOOL SETTING AND LAST YEAR -- WE PARTED OF QUALITY CALIFORNIA CARE CALIFORNIA VESTED PROJECT TO TRY TO MOVE SQUABBLING LEGISLATION -- AROUND AYE TRAININGS FOR SCHOOL AND I FLICKED AND I WAS AND UNFORTUNATELY NOT ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD -- THIS YEAR REMOVING A BETWEEN FORTY FIVE I THINK WE DAVID CHIU THAT WOULD REQUIRE -- BY SHARING OF A TRAINING MODULE DEVELOP BY CITY E.

BY MEDINA AYE WHICH WOULD CREATE REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS TAKE EPIC STUDIES COURSES -- BECAUSE IDEAS COURSES ALLOW FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO MAY NOT LEARN ABOUT IT YOU NEED HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE AND WITH THE RELEVANT EDUCATION PROSTITUTE. OUT LEARN ABOUT EXPERIENCES ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES I'M SO THAT -- I WILL LEAD TO OTHER CONDITIONS IN OUR CONVERSATION HUMAN NATURE SO THEY ARE MUCH FOR CAN THAT BE ABLE TO TEST. ALRIGHT THANK YOU MR MEDINA NEXT WE HAVE -- ERIC HARRIS FROM AND AND THE BOWIE CP WHICH I JUST RENEW MY MEMBERSHIP. GOOD MORNING ó MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONFERENCE OF THE NAACP. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATT MORRIS WHERE IT'S SUJI -- FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. TO HATE CRIMES OF HAS A DEEP HISTORY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S KNOWN TODAY AS THE MOST DIVERSE STATE. IN AMERICA AND WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THAT -- WE'VE ALSO WE ALSO -- BELIEVE THAT WE ARE VERY ACCEPTING A VERY PROGRESSIVE -- HOWEVER CALIFORNIA HAS HAD ISSUES INVOLVING RACISM DISCRIMINATION AND HATRED SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED. HATE INCIDENTS AND CRIMES HAVE OCCURRED AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S HISTORY AND HAS INCLUDED BEATINGS LYNCHINGS AND BOMBINGS. TODAY MORE THAN HALF OF THE HATE CRIMES REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. INVOLVED RACIAL BIAS AND MANY OF THOSE -- INVOLVED HATRED AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS. IT SHOCKED MANY CALIFORNIANS THAT TODAY HATE CRIMES AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS CONTINUE TO RISE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS DID NOT SURPRISE MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS. WHO SEE HATRED A CONSISTENT BASIS? AS REVEREND AMOS BROWN THE PRESIDENT OF THE CUP OF THE SAN FRANCISCO NAACP RECENT RECENTLY POINTED OUT AND AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT TODAY. THE DISCRIMINATION INCREASE CAN BE WENT TO THE POLITICAL RHETORIC IN WASHINGTON DC. THERE ARE MANY INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND MANY THAT HAVE HAPPENED RECENTLY INCLUDING LAST MONTH. THERE ARE COUNTLESS INCIDENTS OF BULLYING DEFACING OF PROPERTY. BREAKING AND ENTERING VERBAL ATTACKS AND INTIMIDATION AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS. LAST MONTH WE SAW TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF HATE WHAT THE VIOLENT ATTACK THOSE SPOKEN ABOUT EARLIER OF WO SISTERS NEIL WILSON AND WITH HE FOR WILSON IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. DNIA WHO WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED. PAT. THE BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT BART STATION IN OAKLAND AT MCCARTY STATION. AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY HAVE EXPRESSED SADNESS AND EVEN FEAR AS A RESULT OF THIS HORRIFIC TRAGEDY. THIS WAS IN A PUBLIC PLACE WITH CAMERAS AND SECURITY. IF WE CANNOT FEEL SAFE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS ONE BEEN WHERE CAN WE FEEL SAFE. THE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN CALLED AN ISOLATED OR A RANDOM INCIDENT. HOWEVER AS LEGALLY LIVE PEROT FROM SLATE MAGAZINE STATED. ABOUT THE STABBING THIS FEELS ANYTHING BUT RANDOM. THIS FEELS LIKE PART OF A RACIST CULTURE WHERE INCIDENTS SUCH AS THIS ONE OCCUR REGULARLY AND WITHOUT MUCH ATTENTION STATEWIDE OR NATIONALLY. STUDIES FROM PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE SHOWN. THAT RACISM AND HATEFUL ACTS COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF RACISM CAN CAUSE PTSD. WHEN THERE ARE? MANY OF THESE INCIDENTS OCCURRING ON A DAILY BASIS THE IMPACT ON THE VICTIMS CAN BE EXTENSIVE. VICTIMS OFTEN FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. WHILE MOST OF US UNDERSTAND Y. PTSD COULD BE THE RESULT OF VIOLENT CRIME VIOLENT HATE CRIMES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT PTSD. CAN ALSO BE THE RESULT OF MARK MICROGRAPH SHINS BUILDING UP MANY. ARE BURKE SORRY ALMOST ONE IN. TEN BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA BECOME TRAUMATIZED BECAUSE OF RACISM AND HATRED. THIS LEADS TO PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DEPRESSION AND OTHER STRESS RELATED AFFECTS. MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS WE'LL TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR THESE FEELINGS BY HAVING A STRONGER SENSE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN IDENTITY. HOWEVER THIS IS TYPICALLY NOT ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE MENTAL ANGUISH OF CONSTANT HATRED. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT TRAUMA CAN ALTER ONE'S PERCEPTION OF OVERALL SAFETY IN SOCIETY. HATE CRIMES WITH AN ANIMUS TOWARDS AFRICAN AMERICANS DOES NOT JUST IMPACT THAT ONE PERSON AT THAT MOMENT. BUT HAS A SUSTAINING IMPACT ON AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE AND REINFORCES STEREOTYPICAL IDEAS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE WORKED HARD. TO FIGHT AGAINST. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS ALSO INTERSECT WITH OTHER GROUPS AS WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER AFRICAN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE ALSO MUSLIM AFRICAN AMERICANS. OF WHO HAVE PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. I AM ALSO INCLUDED IN OF THE INTERSECTION. AND IT IS VERY STRESSFUL AND CAN BE -- VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE OF AN AMOUNT OF FEAR WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE OR BECAUSE WE'RE DISABILITY OR BECAUSE OF YOUR GENDER. OF IDENTITY. MOVING FORWARD THERE ARE TWO MAIN POINTS THAT WE HOPE THE LEGISLATURE -- CONTINUES TO CONSIDER. AS AN ORGANIZATION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE EDUCATED ON HATE CRIMES AND THEIR IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES. SECOND IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE INCIDENTS ALONG WITH AN ADEQUATE FOLLOW UP. AND REPORTING CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEARS THAT COMMUNITIES CARRY WITH THEM [inaudible] FOR GENERATIONS. I LIKE TO THINK. BOTH OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR WORKING WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE NAACP TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER HARRIS NEXT UP WE HAVE THE JANNAT. THEN THEN THE ULTIMATELY FOR THEME LEGISLATIVE STAFF ATTORNEY WITH MALTA SECULAR MUCH FOR HELPING ME LISTA PRONUNCIATION. OKAY AND CITIES TO IT I'M SO GOOD GOOD GOOD MORNING -- I REALLY WANT TO THANK BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CHIU AND US AND WE WERE MURATSUCHI FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR MALTA'S HE NO LONGER FITS ONE OF THE LEADING LATINO CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES WE ARE CELEBRATING OUR FIFTIETH HERE. AND AS I REFLECT ON OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY -- I DO REFLECT ON THE STORIES OF THE HISTORY THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE HERE ERIC -- HAS MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE HISTORY TERMINATION AND OVER POLICING OF OF OF OUR COMMUNITIES OF ALL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT IN PARTICULAR BLOCKING BALCONIES AND AN API COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF BEING OVER POLICE DOES A COMMUNITY AS YOU KNOW IN THE FORTIES THERE WERE THINGS I HAVE. I HAVE THEIR INCIDENTS KNOWN AS ON THIS ISSUE RIOTS WHERE. ON PARTICULAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE TARGETED BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY WERE DRESSED BECAUSE OF PERHAPS THEIR CITIZENSHIP THEY'VE BEEN INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY WHERE THE POLICE HAVE. TARGET OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE THINGS AND LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. UM WE KINDA COME FULL CIRCLE ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STILL. IN A PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BUT HOPEFULLY -- BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS AND CAN BE A LEAD ON A LOT OF THESE ISSUES NATIONALLY WERE HOPING THAT. THAT WE GET START CHANGING THAT DIALOGUE AND THAT DEBATE AND BE MORE INFORMED ABOUT. WHAT IS GOING ON -- IN PARTICULAR WITH OUR COMMUNITY SO FOR LATINOS THERE HAS BEEN A DEFINITE INCREASE IN EIGHT IN HATE CRIMES. OVER 50% AN INCREASE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT I'M A LOT OF THIS HAD AS A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH THE RHETORIC THAT WE'RE HEARING COMING OUT FROM. WASHINGTON D. C. AND THIS FEDERAL AND THE UNITED STATES CALLING. THE EMAIL AND LETTING THE IMMIGRANTS IN TRADERS FUHRMAN ANIMAL RAPIST YOU NAME IT. IT IS OPEN SEASON ON IMMIGRANTS AND IT'S NOT JUST THE UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS WHO ARE AT THE SHOULD BE FEELING VULNERABLE THIS ADMINISTRATION WITH ITS IMMIGRATION POLICIES IS REALLY. GOING AFTER ALL LATINOS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLICIES THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW AT THE BORDER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT -- POLICIES THAT ARE CHANGING TOWARDS OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS OPENING RE OPENING CASES OF FOLKS THAT WHO HAVE ALREADY NATURALIZED FOR POTENTIAL FRAUD FOR FOR POTENTIAL SHORTCOMINGS IN. IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS IT'S REALLY OPEN SEASON ON ALL IMMIGRANTS. OF ALL COLORS AND ARE WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS FACING RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS FACING THERE IS REAL FEAR AMONG IMMIGRANTS I AM AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY OTHER PRACTICING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I DO. SEVERAL MILLION RIGHTS PRESENTATIONS ON THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND I CAN SEE RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION GOING TO THESE OF WORKSHOPS AND CAN YOU BE CERTAIN IS A COMMUNITY BASED -- FORUMS -- I WOULD GET FLOODED WITH PEOPLE AFTER I GAVE A PRESENTATION ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT. ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION WHAT I WOULD DO THESE PRESENTATIONS I WOULD HAVE ANYONE COME UP TO ME BECAUSE THEY ARE SO AFRAID. TALK OUT LOUD TO ANYONE ABOUT ANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE FACING SOARED TO THE TERMS OF THE FEAR THAT IS GOING ON WITH IMMIGRANTS. YOU CAN ALMOST TOUCH IT YOU COULD FEEL THE FEAR THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE FEELING THAT THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE. AYE LIVING DAILY ON THERE'S A FEAR IN REPORTING HATE CRIMES IN PARTICULAR -- BECAUSE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ICE POLICE ENTANGLEMENT. AGAIN CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN THE LEAD INTO AND PASSING LEGISLATION LIKE THE TRUCKS DOT THE TO THAT AND THE SANCTION AND THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT S. B.. FIFTY FOUR THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL BUT IT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED EARLIER. THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM THE TOP DOWN TALKING ABOUT THESE POLICIES AND IT IN A WAY THAT. INSURERS TRUST FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OUT THERE VOCALLY SAYING THAT THEY ARE AGAINST SANCTUARY POLICIES AGAINST SB. FIFTY FOUR THAT SPREADS WIDE AND DEEP INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF ENHANCING THAT FEAR. OF FROM THE CALLING THE POLICE THE ONLY WAY THAT A LOT OF OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN GET SOME ASSISTANCE IS BY. CALLING THE POLICE BUT KNOWING THAT LEADERSHIP IS -- YOU. IS NOT WORKING TO BUILD TRUST WITH THESE COMMUNITIES REALLY MAKES THOSE PHONE CALLS REALLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE IT SPECIAL WHEN YOU HAVE. SOMEONE WHO'S UNDOCUMENTED OR FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE THAT IS UNDOCUMENTED. SO REALLY LOOKING AT THOSE POLICIES -- TO ENSURE THAT ICE AND POLICE ENTANGLEMENT -- DOES NOT CONTINUE THAT WE KEEP ICE AND POLICE COLLABORATIONS. THAT WE CONTINUE TO HOLD -- OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR UPHOLDING THE LAWS THAT THE STATE HAS PASSED I THINK THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT AND THAT ALSO STRIKES WITH -- THE TOP DOWN FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DEFINITELY -- ONE EVERY OTHER WAY HOW IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PROVIDE I'M REALLY -- AND MEANINGFUL GUIDANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THAT -- SOME OF THESE -- POLICIES CAN PERMEATE OUR COMMUNITIES MUCH BATTER AND SO FEET SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN FEEL SAFER COMING FORWARD AND REPORTING THESE CRIMES -- I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE DO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO ALL CRIME VICTIMS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS -- YOU KNOW I OUR ORGANIZATION GETS CALLS FROM FOLKS ALL THE TIME ABOUT HATE CRIMES -- WE HAVE SOMEONE TO FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN -- THREATENED AND HARASSED BY THEIR NEED -- FOR THAT THEY WOULD THINK THEY WOULD CALL RICE ON ON THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY NOW THIS FAMILIES LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LIVE THERE TOO AFRAID TO REPORT THIS INCIDENT. TO THEIR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY REALLY DON'T SEE ANY OTHER RECOURSE OR ABILITY TO SORT OF YOU KNOW SPEAK OUT ABOUT THIS INCIDENT OTHER THAN COMING. FORWARD TO A COMMUNITY BASED ON THE COMPONENT OBVIOUSLY IS LANGUAGE ACCESS -- LATINOS ARE NOT A HOMOGENEOUS AND IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T ALL SPEAK SPANISH A LOT OF US ARE INDIGENOUS -- THE STORIES THAT I HAVE ACTUALLY COME FROM SOME INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES WHERE FOLKS SPEAK ME SPECKLE -- AT THE END AND OTHER INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES ON THE INABILITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CALL APPROPRIATE INTERPRETERS WHEN VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD HIT IS STILL AN ISSUE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE -- AND IT'S EVEN UP BROUGHT BIGGER ISSUE FOR THESE INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES -- WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE NO SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- THAT COME FROM THE EAST. CAN BE IS -- THEY COME FROM THESE LANGUAGE MINORITIES AS WELL AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE PROVISION OF LANGUAGE ACCESS SERVICES AND MAKE IT TIMELY IN MAKING. AND REAL TIME SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE FACING ON THE GROUND -- AND THEN -- LASTLY I I JUST WANNA CAN CONTINUE -- BY SAYING THAT I I DO THINK CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD ON THIS WE CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD ON POLICIES WHERE. WE DO BILL THAT WERE LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES TAKE IT THE LEADERSHIP AND BUILD. UP BILLS THAT TRUST WITH GOT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SO THE DEMOCRATS CAN FEEL SAFE AND INCOME FORWARD -- AND I DID ONE HIGHLIGHT THE MOST RECENT ANECDOTES OF HE CLAIMS THAT OUR COMMUNITY -- I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE THE MOST RECENT ONE THAT -- HAS BEEN MAKING THE WAYS AND IN MEDIA HAS BEEN. THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED ON JULY FOURTH THERE WAS A ELDERLY GENTLEMEN WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND HE WAS ACCUSED OF OF BUMPING INTO. A LITTLE FOR ALL -- THE MOTHER OF THIS YOUNG GIRL. HE REALLY GAVE ME AND STARTED YELLING HUNTING AND TELLING HIM TO GO BACK COUNTRY. SHE ASSAULTED HIM WITH THE BREAK UP OTHER A COMMUNITY MEMBERS WANTED TO JUMP IN AND HELP BUT THEY WERE ALSO THREATENED BY THIS WOMAN. IF YOU STEP IF YOU TAKE ONE STEP CLOSER. BEGIN ALL DO THE SAME HARM TO YOU AND SO -- EITHER THESE ARE INCIDENTS THAT ARE VERY REAL THERE ARE YOU KNOW I'LL. AFFECTING FOLKS IN THAT INTERSECTIONAL NOT MANNER THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS GRACE. EIGHT SHOULD DISABILITY -- AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT WAYS TO ENSURE THAT. I FEEL WHEN VICTIMS [inaudible] PLEASE TO COURT THIS IN A WAY THAT IS SAFE. AND THAT -- REALLY HONORS. WHAT THE INCIDENT -- MEANS TO THEM AND HOW IT HAS IMPACTED THEM BECAUSE IT'S IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT ALL FACETS. OF THE STORIES ARE NOT JUST LOOK AT THEM SO ONE DIMENSIONAL SO THAT WE DO UNDERSTAND SORT OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF HATE CRIMES WE COULD POTENTIALLY. WORK TOWARDS A MEDICATING IT HERE FOR THE CIVIC CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LORENA. ANNOUNCE YOUR NAME AGAIN. IS THEN NITPICKING FUNNY BUT THE THEN YOU'RE PUTTING IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THE L. BY LAST BUT NONE OF THESE WILL HAVE FUN THIS YEAR VOEPEL. PROFITS ISRAEL WAS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HIGH ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND MY APOLOGIES TO THE EXTENT THAT I MAY AT TIMES HAVE MY BACK TO ALL OR SOME OF THE WHO. SO -- AT AGAIN THANK YOU TO A ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND WORD SUCI FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING OF FOR A PUSHING FOR THIS AUDIT TO TAKE PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE. UP BECAUSE IT'S AYE YIELDED TODAY'S EVENT THIS DISCUSSION AND HOPEFULLY A LOT OF POSITIVE OF WORK BY. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES I MEAN BECAUSE SINCE NINETEEN THIRTEEN THE MISSION OF THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE HAS BEEN TO STOP THE DEFAMATION OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND SECURE JUSTICE AND FAIR TREATMENT FOR ALL. WE'RE DEDICATED TO COMBATING ANTISEMITISM PREJUDICE AND BIGOTRY OF ALL KINDS AS WELL DEPENDING DE DEMOCRATIC IDEALS IN PROMOTING CIVIL RIGHTS. THE FBI TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN HATE CRIME REPORT IS THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL HATE CRIME REPORT THAT WE HAVE. THAT REPORT DOCUMENTED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE RELIGIOUS UP BASED RELIGION BASED HATE CRIMES WHICH COMPRISED OVER 20% OF THE TOTAL. ANTI SEMITIC HATE CRIMES REPRESENTED ABOUT 53% OF THOSE HATE CRIMES THAT WAS A SLIGHT INCREASE FROM UP FROM THE YEAR BEFORE. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ANTI JEWISH HATE CRIMES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR ANYWHERE FROM BASED HATE CRIMES ACROSS THE U. S.. WHICH IS AN ESPECIALLY DISTURBING STATISTIC WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT JEWS COMPRISE LESS THAN 3% OF THE U. S. POPULATION. THIS AS SORT OF TRENDS IN NUMBERS IS ALSO REFLECTED IN CALIFORNIA STATISTICS. WE JUST SAW THE RELEASE OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HATE CRIME REPORT FOR CALIFORNIA. THERE WERE A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN OF RELIGION BASED TAKE CRIME EVENTS AND CALIFORNIA. AND FULLY HALF OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR WERE ALSO ANTI SEMITIC. AND THE EYES I KNOW THAT THIS IS A AN INCREASE FROM A TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN EXCUSE ME TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THERE WERE -- EIGHTY TWO SUCH EVENTS. AND IF YOU GO BACK IN PRIOR YEARS AND CALIFORNIA YOU'LL ALSO SEE THAT ANTI SEMITIC I HATE CRIMES MAKE UP OF THE BULK OF THE RELIGION BASED -- HATE CRIMES. SO AND THAT'S A IT'S IT'S IT'S NEVER SURPRISING WHEN WE SEE THOSE NUMBERS UNFORTUNATELY YEAR AFTER YEAR. EIGHTY EL -- HAS ALSO BEEN KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT WE TERM ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS -- SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WE HAVE COMPILED AN ANNUAL AUDIT OF ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS THAT INCLUDE BOTH CRIMINAL AND NOT I MIDDLE INCIDENTS. OF OF ANTISEMITISM SO HARASSMENT BULLYING -- THINGS THAT WOULD BE. IT TO USE THE TERMINOLOGY HERE HATE INCIDENTS OR ACTUAL HATE CRIMES. AND WE KNOW THAT FOR EVERY ACT OF HATE TO BE IT AND AN INCIDENT BE IT BEATIN ACTUAL HATE CRIME AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OF MY A FELLOW PANELISTS AND AND OTHER SPEAKERS THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER -- JEWS JEWISH FAMILIES JEWISH COMMUNITIES WHO FEEL THE IMPACT I'M OF THAT ACT OF HATE AND THAT MESSAGE OF EXCLUSION THAT SENT WE TALK ABOUT HATE CRIMES AS MESSAGE CRIMES. I'M A LOT OF THE CRIMES THAT WARNER REPORT THIS YEAR OR YEAH YOU COULD ARGUE RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL CRIMES HE NO SIMPLE ASSAULTS VANDALISM THAT SORT OF THING BUT THEY MAKE THE TV NEWS. AND HERE WE ARE TODAY. AND IT'S BECAUSE THOSE ARE -- THEY SEND A MESSAGE OF TERROR AND EXCLUSION TO THOUGH THAT ENTIRE COMMUNITY. SO IF I SQUALL A SWASTIKA ON THE SYNAGOGUE VERSES SOMEBODY SQUALLS NANCY WAS HERE ON THE SYNAGOGUE. I AT THAT ROUTE IT'S IT'S VANDALISM AT THE SAME PAINT ON THE SIDE OF THE SYNAGOGUE BUT ONE IS AN ANNOYANCE AND THEN THE OTHER SENDS AND A COMPLETE MESSAGE OF TERROR TO TO THAT WHOLE COMMUNITY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE FEEL. AND SO -- HISTORICALLY -- IN THIS COUNTRY AND OTHER COUNTRIES OVER CENTURIES A ANTI SEMITISM HAS OFTEN BEEN THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. I ANTI JEWISH HATE FREQUENTLY PRESENT IS AS PRESAGES. ARISE AND OTHER FORMS OF BIGOTRY AND THREATENS TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRATIC IDEALS IN COMMUNITIES AND SERVES AS AN INDICATOR OF HEALTH OF THE SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. SO WE WE COMPILE THIS AUDIT -- USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY VICTIMS ON FORCE MEANT -- MEDIA REPORTS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS WE EVALUATE THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ARE BELIEVABLE. UP SIMILAR TO THE HATE CRIME REPORT THAT REALLY THAT THEY PROVIDE JUSTICE SHOT OF THE STATE OF ANTI SEMITISM IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT WE IT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A COMPREHENSIVE. BUT DATA DRIVE POLICY AND ONLY THREE YEARS INTO THE DOING THOSE THOSE AUDITS UP MY PROFESSIONAL FOREBEARS ACTUALLY DRAFTED MODEL HATE CRIMES STATUTE A IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND BEGAN SHOPPING IT AROUND TO VARIOUS STATE LEGISLATURES. AND LIVE MAY HERCULEAN EFFORTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT FINALLY RESULTED IN THE IN THE SHEPHERD BIRD ACT I IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SO I'M ANTI SEMITISM I IS IT CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE BIT OF A MOVING TARGET BUT IT. YOU EDIT IT INVOLVES AYE AT ITS ROOT -- AND IT REALLY A LARGER DISCUSSION IS FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT A FORM OF HATRED OR MISS TRUSTS ARE CONTEMPT FOR INDIVIDUAL JEWS -- JEWISH GROUPS THAT JEWISH COLLECTIVE USUALLY -- FOCUSED AROUND -- CONSPIRACY THEORIES OF SOME SORT IN YOU KNOW ABOUT -- JEWS INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A COLLECT [inaudible] THAT IS I EXERCISE FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL. GAIN [inaudible] I THE AUDIT -- AND SO THAT'S YOU GOOD APPROXIMATELY THE DEFINITION THAT THAT WE USE THE AUDIT DATA THAT WE TALLIED FOR A NEW TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOWS AN INCREASE OF OVER TWENTY SIXTEEN INCLUDING PHYSICAL ASSAULTS VANDALISM ETCETERA. CALIFORNIA HAD -- IT SO THERE ISN'T ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX INCIDENTS TOTAL CALIFORNIA WE RECORDED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT INCIDENTS TOTAL SECOND ONLY A BEHIND NEW YORK STATE I'M FORTUNATELY -- WE DID NOT UP THE ONLY CATEGORY WHERE I INCIDENTS WHAT DOWN WAS AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL ASSAULT -- WE RECORDED SIX AND TWENTY SIXTEEN ZERO IN IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SOME EXAMPLES UP FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND A LOTS OF OF VANDALISM OF SYNAGOGUES UNFORTUNATELY XILED THE STANDING FOR ZIONIST OCCUPIED GOVERNMENT THREATENING GRAFFITI ON THE SYNAGOGUE -- F. YOU I'M DON'T USE THE WORDS JEWISH* -- ON THE AND I GOT -- SMASHED WINDOWS -- OF THAT SORT OF THING ON SEVERAL OTHERS. WE'VE HAD -- THREATS AND HARASSMENT JUST THIS PAST APRIL IN IRVINE MAN WAS CHARGED WITH FELONY I HATE CRIME FOR MAKING A CRIMINAL THREATS -- AGAINST JEWS AYE IN HIS COMMUNITY -- UP WITH HAVING AN ALLEGED KILL LIST AND A LIST OF STEPS FOR POPE KILLING MY FIRST JEW -- THIS NEXT INCIDENT HAPPENS UP FREQUENTLY AND I BELIEVE HAPPENS FREQUENTLY TO PEOPLE ANOTHER -- COMMUNITIES A MAN IN A CAR TOM DIDN'T ORTHODOX JEW WHILE HE WAS WALKING HOME FROM SYNAGOGUE WITH THINGS LIKE* SALUTES AND AND OTHER TYPES OF UPSETS -- GENERALLY ANOTHER CERTAINLY OF THE SORT OF AND THOSE I'M -- GENERALLY. OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES OFFICE IN A LOS ANGELES WAS A TAD WITH NEO A LAST YEAR -- IN -- AT A HIGH SCHOOL -- IN ALAMEDA AND TWENTY PHOEBE I'M ONE OF THE CLASSROOM DESKS CHOOSE OUR EVIL SWASTIKAS* FLAGS A STAR OF DAVID DRAWN NEXT TO AN IMAGE OF A OF A BAD WITH DOLLARS. THE SAME STUDENTS HAVE -- WHO WHO WHO WHO DISCOVERED THE CONFETTI HAD HERSELF BEEN -- PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BEING SENT ANTI SEMITIC TEXT MESSAGES FROM CLASSMATES -- WITH EPITHETS FOR JEWS -- PRAISES FOR ADOLF HITLER IT SANTORUM. WHICH BRINGS ME -- TO BULLYING AND THIS IS BEEN A THEME -- THROUGHOUT -- CERTAINLY WILL BE YOU HAVE THAT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REPORTS THAT COME TO US OF INAPPROPRIATE I'M NOT SEE -- AND HOLOCAUST ARE RELATED COMMENTS LIKE THE BACK TO THE UP AND THE BACK CONCENTRATION CAMPS BEING MADE A TO A JEWISH STUDENTS -- ADS -- MOSTLY IN THE MIDDLE -- FLYERS AT A HIGH SCHOOL SAYING NO SHOES NO PROBLEM AND SOMEBODY SAYING TO US STUDENT IN ALAMO WE WILL SLAUGHTER YOUR JEWISH GOD EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT HATE CRIME -- WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY A ABOUT AND I WAS ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT I WAS REMINDED OF THIS YOU KNOW NON A CRIMINAL I'M INCIDENTS OF HATE. ABOUT OF A RISE IN JUST IN GENERAL FEELINGS -- ABOUT -- MORE AYE AT A TIME IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN -- MAY BE HATE OF MANY SORTS -- IS FEELING NORMAL AND IT REMINDS ME OF A LEARNING MODULE THAT WE HAVE THAT WE DEVELOPED AFTER HOLOCAUST EDUCATION ACTUALLY BUT WE USE IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS CALLED THE PYRAMID OF HATE -- pAND YOU TALK ABOUT -- THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID WHERE REALLY ALL OF US HAVE BEEN AT SOME POINTS -- BEING -- THE BASE OF THE HIDING IT STRENGTHENED THAT'S PEOPLE'S JUST BIASED ATTITUDES YOU KNOW ATTITUDES THAT NEO JUDGMENTS THAT YOU A FORM -- IN THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE ABOUT OTHERS OFTEN UNCONSCIOUSLY. AND IF YOU DON'T AT SOME POINT CHECK A BIASES AT THAT LEVEL -- WHETHER YOUR IT'S IN SCHOOL IN THE WORKPLACE OR YOUR YOUR FRIENDS. CHECK YOU'RE YOU HAVE MOMENT OF ENLIGHTENMENT YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU YOU MOVE UP THE PYRAMID. AND MAYBE -- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SIT WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AT THE LUNCH TABLE. YOU KNOW USE YOU DON'T INVITE THEM TO YOUR PARTIES YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING IT'S MORE SOCIAL EXCLUSION YOU'RE MORE OPEN WITH THE SORT OF SO CALLED JOKES THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TELL. I'M AND WILLING TO LAUGH AT I'M IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN CHECKED AT THAT LEVEL AND THEN YOU RISE UP EVEN FURTHER AND YOU REALLY MORE HARASSING PEOPLE -- BE IT IN THE SCHOOL CONTEXT AND IT'S BULLYING. A A WORKPLACE CONTEXT AND IT WHERE LEGAL LIABILITY -- MAY ATTACH SUDDENLY OR NOT RUN YOU KNOW YOU PURSUE IT'S DIFFERENT TO YOU -- DEVOUT DENYING THEM A JOB ETCETERA. AND THEN YOU MOVE UP FURTHER FROM THERE IF YOU'RE STILL NOT CHECKED AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET INTO HATE CRIMES LOW LEVEL HATE CRIMES MORE VIOLENT HATE CRIMES AND ULTIMATELY OF COURSE THE VERY TOP OF THE PYRAMID CONSIDERING A WE DEVELOP THIS IN THE HOLOCAUST EDUCATION IS GENOCIDE. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THAT WOULD BE THE VERY TOP. AND THE IDEA IS THAT IT ALL STARTS AT THE BOTTOM WITH THESE WORDS. BUT THESE BIASED ATTITUDES THAT GO UNCHECKED. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU SEE THESE BULLYING INCIDENTS HE'S A RELATIVELY LOW LYING INCIDENTS IT IT IT IT. IT. I I THINK FOR ALL OF US IT GIVES US A SWELLING OF OKAY YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR IF WE DON'T STOP IT IS IT'S IT'S GOING TO ESCALATE THIS IS NOW I'M A TIME WHEN. YOU KNOW IF THE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE. THE PERSON WHO COMMITS THE HATE CRIME AT A HIGHER LEVEL IN THE PYRAMID FEELS THE SUPPORT. THINKS THAT PERSON HAS SUPPORT AT THE LOWER END OF DISAPPEAR UP OF OF THE PYRAMID NOT TO COME. PLEASE LEAP KEEP TORTURING THIS THIS METAPHOR BUT IT REALLY REMINDS ME OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M A WE TALK ABOUT THEN OF THE MESSAGE OF HATE. I'VE THAT BULLYING SENDS THAT I THAT -- THAT HATE CRIMES AND WHAT YOU KNOW WHERE LEADERSHIP THAT WE NEED TO SEE FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE A. G. FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES -- AND EVEN FOR WHAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL CRIME OR LOW OR AN ACTIVE YOU'LL SPRAY PAINT VANDALISM OR SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE PERPETRATOR NEEDS TO BE TOLD THIS IS NOT OKAY THE PERPETRATOR SENTIMENTS SUCH A PAID AN EXCLUSION. THAT PERPETRATOR NEEDS TO BE TOLD THAT IS NOT OKAY HERE. AND WE WILL STOP YOU FROM FROM GOING ANY FURTHER -- WITH SANCTIONS WITH WITH CONDEMNATION AT CETERA -- I I THINK THAT'S AND SO I THINK I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE MESSAGING HOUSE TO BE -- AS AND THAT THAT'S A I DON'T SPEAK FOR PEOPLE BUT THAT'S BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING -- IN THE IN THE VARIOUS CALLS FOR LEADERSHIP AND HOW IT STARTS AT THE TOP DOWN AND COMMUNITIES NEED TO HEAR THAT. TO BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HEAR IT ALSO IN RESPONSE TO THE SO CALLED HATE INCIDENT WHERE -- IT'S IT'S A IT'S A NON CRIMINAL ACT IS A VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE MADE ITS FIRST FIRST AMENDMENT ACT BUT NONE THE LESS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT -- OFFICERS IV AND THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE OF ALL DOCUMENTED THAT OF A COMMUNITIES WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE FAITH IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OR TO COME FORWARD -- AND REPORT ACTUAL HATE CRIME IF THEY THINK THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DON'T DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FEES EVEN NON CRIMINAL INCIDENTS ON THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE. ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES WHERE SORT OF INCIDENTS HAPPENINGS YAO WHITE SUPREMACIST FIRING NOW UNFORTUNATELY WHICH WE'VE DOCUMENT IT. SO I.

MY NAME IS DOCTOR JED THE SAYING I'M THE COFOUNDER OF THE SICK AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND. WHICH IS THE FIRST SICK AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION -- WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR TWENTY SIXTH YEAR. AND DEALING WITH EXISTS BEFORE NINE ELEVEN WAYS THAT. TWENTY FIVE SOMEWHERE ON THE SO IBM'S SCHOLAR AND I'M IN THE STORY AND AND I LOOK AT RACE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND MY I PUBLISHED MY FIRST ARTICLE ON HATE VIOLENCE AGAINST SICK AMERICANS HISTORY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. THE SUMMING UP ENGINE FOR A VERY LONG TIME [inaudible] AND SO. WHAT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU MAY BE A PICTURE OF A SICK COMMUNITIES FEELING IN THE STATE AND HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS IF YOU CAN BEAR WITH ME IT IS LIKE TO REACH A PEACE? THAT I WROTE SOMETIME BACK. NOW MANY TAKE A NOVEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND JUST LOOK AT THAT SIX WEEK PERIOD MOSTLY JUST DECEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTY OKAY SO GOING BACK A FEW YEARS. ON NOVEMBER SIX BELINDA GEET SAYING A SICK AMERICAN BUS DRIVER IN LOS ANGELES WAS ATTACKED. WELL DRIVING THE CITY BUS. MY PASSENGER CALLED IN BOTH THE TERRORIST AND A SUICIDE BOMBER. HE ALSO ACCUSED THE SICK AMERICAN MEN OF HIJACKING THE BUS. THE VICIOUS ATTACK LEFT MISTER SAYING WITH THE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED FACE AND JOHN INFECTION INSIDE. NO ONE OF THE REASONS THIS ATTACK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE DESPITE THE OBVIOUS RACIAL RELIGIOUS BIAS EVIDENCE IN THE ATTACK THE POLICE THE POLICE INITIALLY RESISTED CALLING IT. A HATE CRIME. THIS REPLICATES A PATTERN REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WHEN WORKING CLASSIC AMERICANS BECOME TARGETS OF HATE VIOLENCE? IN CASE AFTER CASE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SLOW OR EVEN RESISTANT. TO RECOGNIZING THE HATE BASED ORIGIN OF SUCH ATTACKS. IN NUMEROUS CASES ONLY PRESSURE FROM SEEK ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AS FORCE LAW ENFORCEMENT FOUND HATE CRIME CHARGES. THIS HAS TO CHANGE. ON ON DECEMBER SECOND VALERIE COR A NATIONAL INTERFAITH LEADER A FILMMAKER A LAWYER AND HAVE TO SIMPLY BY STANFORD HAS TO BE SOME STANFORD -- HARVARD AND YALE. WAS ON A FLIGHT HOME FROM MEETING OF INTERFAITH LEADERS WHEN ANGLICAN FIVE BY WHITE MAN AFTER FOR MOVED ATTACK FROM HER ALREADY SCREEN TO CARRY ON BACK. IN THE END THE SICK AMERICAN MOTHER WAS FORCED TO REVEAL A BREAST PUMP TO PROVE THAT SHE WAS NOT A TERRORIST. A WEEK LATER JOHNSON A SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD SICK AMERICAN MAN WAS STRUCK ON THE TURBINE WITH AN APPLE BY PASSING MOTORISTS WELL PICKING HIS GRANDCHILD UP. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN BAKERSFIELD. THE FRUIT WAS THROWN WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT SHATTERED UPON HITTING THE MAN'S HEAD. LEAVING THE OTHER WITH PAIN AND DIZZINESS FOR DAYS NOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN WEARING A TURBAN. THE INTEREST OF IN MUCH WORSE IS KIND OF MIRACULOUS. TWO DAYS LATER AND I'M GONNA LEAVE THE STATE ARE MONTHS SAYING TWELVE YEARS OLD BORN AND RAISED IN TEXAS WAS HANDCUFFED AND SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL AND SPENT THREE DAYS IN A JUVENILE FACILITY. IN ARLINGTON TEXAS BECAUSE ANOTHER STUDENT USE WITH HAVING A BOMB HIS BACKPACK. THE CHILD WAS UNDERGONE THREE OPEN HEART SURGERIES INCARCERATED AT HIS PARENTS BEING INFORMED IS WHERE ABOUT WHAT THE SCHOOL OR POLICE. THE SICK WHEN SAYS HE'S INNOCENT AND THE OPPOSITE EPISODE RESULTED FROM ANOTHER STUDENT FALSELY ACCUSING HIM. BASICALLY FOR BOWLING. THE INCIDENT GRAPHICALLY ILLUSTRATES THE VULNERABILITY OF SICK AMERICAN CHILDREN. TWO DAYS AFTER THAT A SICK AMERICAN MEN IN A IN A IN A STORE IN A STORE IN GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN WE SHOT IN THE FACE. THE CELL WHO FIRST COLUMN A TERRACE ALSO SAID HE USED TO KILL PEOPLE I CAN IN IRAQ. TWO DAYS LATER ROUNDING OUT A SH WEEK OF SHOCKING RACISM HATE AGAINST SICK AMERICANS SYMCOR SANGHA FROM FREMONT CALIFORNIA. WAS QUESTIONED BY POLICE AT OUR HOME. AFTER SHE'D ASKED ABOUT AMMUNITION FOR HER RIFLE AT A LOCAL SPORTING GOODS STORE. SAID MISTER UNGER WHO IS A LICENSED FIREARMS INSTRUCTOR PREPARING TO BECOME. A LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER. THIS SINGLE ME OUT OF THE WAY THAT I LOOK. I WOULD FRIENDS PURCHASE BULK AMMO AND THEY NEVER HAD POLICE SHOW UP AT THE DOOR. THE SAME WEEK OF ANY OF A SICK AMERICAN MAN FROM CALIFORNIA SLEEPING ON A PLANE WAS POSTED TO YOUTUBE THE CAPTION. WOULD YOU FEEL SLAVE SAFE FLYING WITH BIN LADEN. THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS SIXTY EIGHT YEAR OLD SICK AMERICAN FARM WORKER MIXING BOWL WAS ASSAULTED BY TWO WHITE MEN IN FRESNO WHILE WAITING FOR A RIDE TO WORK IN THE PREDAWN FOG. AFTER YOUNG OBSCENITIES AT THE ELDERLY MAN IS A SALES HIT HIM WITH THEIR TRUCK AS HE TRIED TO GET AWAY. AS THEY ATTACKED IN ONE OF THE SUSPECTS SCREAMED WHY ARE YOU HERE. MISTER BALL SUFFERED ABRASIONS TO THE NOSE IN HAND AND A BROKEN COLLAR BONE AS WELL AS CUTS REQUIRING STITCHES ON HIS EAR IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. WELL IS ATTACKERS WERE CAUGHT AND CHARGED HATE CRIMES. THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOTHING ADDRESS CONDITIONS THAT LED TO THIS HATE ATTACK. THEN ON NEW YEAR'S DAY RETURN SINGLE ALSO SIXTY EIGHT ALSO IN FRESNO WAS STABBED TO DEATH AT A CONVENIENCE STORE WHERE HE WORKED IT WAS THE FIRST HOMICIDE IN CALIFORNIA. IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS IS ALL BEFORE DONALD TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE [inaudible] SO. YOU KNOW AS A SCHOLAR THE WORK I WORK I DO AYE AYES AYE ISOLATED PHENOMENA WHICH I CALL THE RACIALIZATION RELIGIOUS IDENTITY. AND I BELIEVE IT'S BEEN OPERATION SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CERTAIN XCELERATED AFTER TWO THOUSAND ONE WERE RACE. HAS BECOME OPUS OUR RELIGIOUS IDENTITY HAS BEEN COMING ABUSE BICU WITH RACIAL MEANING. THAT'S CERTAINLY CENTRAL TO WHY MUSLIMS SIX BROWN PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY BEING ATTACKED FOR BEING HARASSED BY POLICE PLAYING. CARESS OF AIRPORTS. SO YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THE STATE OF THE SICK COMMUNITYIS ONE OF EMERGENCY IT'S BEEN THIS WAY FROM MOST TWO DECADES VERY A GENERATION GROUP WOULD DAILY TRAUMA. FOR SICK BOY NOT INDOOR BOWLING IN THIS IN THIS IN THIS SOCIETY IS ALMOST UNHEARD OF GIRLS ISN'T MUCH BETTER SO. WHEN EMPLOYED WANT ONE MORE POINT I WANT TO MAKE SO SICK COMMUNITY WAS VERY VERY HAPPY TWENTY SIXTEEN BECAUSE THE FBI HAD FINALLY AGREED TO TRACK IT BECAUSE BY RACE? WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH THE NUMBER FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR WAS? SIX SO AS A SCHOLAR AND AN ADVOCATE I THINK IT'S BETTER FOR THE FBI TO STOP CRIME COUNTING A CRIMES. BECAUSE THE UNDERCOUNTED SO SEVERE THAT IT MARGINALIZES US AND IT INVISIBLE EYES IS THE PROBLEM OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW CLOSE TO MILLION SIX ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY BASIS AND IT'S NOT JUST US MUSLIMS SIX IN THOSE BUDDHISTS. ARE OUR OUR SLICE OF WORSHIPPER ATTACKED. ANDBEFORE WE CAN EVEN BUILD THEM THERE AND I RIGHT THEN THEY WANTED TO BUILD. A MUST HIT THE GROUND ZERO CLOSE TO GROUND ZERO DOZEN US ANOTHER MUST OF THE FEW BLOCKS AWAY. BUT RACISTS FOUGHT IT. SO THIS IS THE STATE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S A STATE OF SEVERE EMERGENCY FOR THOSE WHO I CALL OUR MEN OF PROFILE COMMUNITIES OF PROFILE BECAUSE WE ALWAYS FIT THE PROFILE. SO I PLEAD WITH YOU THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM HAS TO BE ALTERED A CRIMES ARE BEING IGNORED WHEN THEY'RE COUNTED THE BEING COUNTED INSUFFICIENTLY. AND THERE'S RESISTANCE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO YOU KNOW THE SICK AMERICA LEGAL OFFENSIVE ARE FINDING ALL OF THEIR SICK ADVOCACY GROUPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. STAND READY TO WORK WITH YOU AND PLEASE CALL US FOR EXPERTISE WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY ARE MULTI FOR THE LENGTH OF NO PROBLEM NO EXIT IMMIGRANT MYSELF I UNDERSTAND. YOUR PAIN AND FRUSTRATION BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY OF AND FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SIX YEARS. I THINK THE IT EVERY LITTLE BIT OF AFTER THAT THE LOOP WE CAN DO. AND IN THE COMMUNITY WILL HELP TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMIN AND GOT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE. DOES THE HEARINGS OF THE GOING
