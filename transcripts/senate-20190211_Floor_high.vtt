SOMETHING SO THIS BRAVE MAN TOOK

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.669
AND RAN OVER IF IT RAN A CROSS

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.070
AN OPEN FIELD --

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:47.472

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:03.888
EVERY TIME HE CONTINUE TO GET UP

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:05.456
AND RAN TOWARDS THAT --

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:07.492
HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE UNTIL HE

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:08.159
WAS ABLE TO THROW A GRENADE INTO

THAT WALL THAT HE WANTED TO

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.703

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.570
I WANT TO BRING IT TODAY IS IS

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:20.438

IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT NICK

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.686
KNOWLEDGE CONTRIBUTIONS AFRICAN

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.321

CALIFORNIANS A PARTICULAR.

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.198
I THINK IT'S TRAGIC THAT IN

TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WE'RE EVEN

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.466

COMMEMORATIONS I THINK IT'S

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:25.216
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:26.717
GIVES US A MOMENT. TO PAUSE IN

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.019
TIME.

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:31.422

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:32.656
KNOWLEDGE.

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:33.924
LACK THEREOF.

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:35.826
BIASES.

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:38.062

OUR SALES IN OUR CONSTITUENTS.

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:43.200
THAT WE WILL WORK VERY HARD TO
