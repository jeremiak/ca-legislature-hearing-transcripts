LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF BILLS THAT WILL BE HEARD WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION AND ONE THAT I DO NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE PROPOSED MEANINGFUL LEGISLATION ADDRESSING DIVERSE ISSUES WITHIN THE PRIVACY SPACE. MANY OF WHICH I BELIEVE WILL ULTIMATELY BE IN THE LONG TERM BEST INTEREST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS LEGISLATORS WE HOW IS SERIOUS AND SOBER. UP DUTY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND PRIVACY INTEREST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE MOST AT RISK TODAY. IN TWENTY TWENTY.

AS WE STRIVE TO PROVE PREVENT TREAT AND CONTROL COVERT NINETEEN WE MUST ALSO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN. PROTECTING PRIVACY IN PROMOTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH. AS SUCH I STAND READY ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO CLOSELY ANALYZE BOTH. EMERGING TO OUR LEGISLATION AND PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENT PRACTICES TO ENSURE THAT CIVIC. LIBERTY LIT CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE NOT COMPROMISED AND ALL FIGHT TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. I FEEL A DUTY TO FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT TO ENSURE THAT BOTH CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO CIVIL LIBERTY. AND HISTORY OF INNOVATION REMAIN INTACT. TOGETHER WE CAN GRILL. DURING THIS CRISIS IN A MANNER TO FALL AT THE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO BE ADAPTIVE RESPONSIVE AND FLEXIBLE TO THE NEEDS OF THE STATE AS A WHOLE. I'M SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO OUR FIRST AUTHOR- ONE AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE THIS GONZALEZ I LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO. COME ON UP TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. JUST A QUICK REMINDER FOR THOSE WISHING TO REGISTER THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION BY PHONE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CALL IN NOW. THE BEGINNING OF THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS TESTIMONY TO AVOID ANY DELAYS. THE PHONE NUMBER AGAIN IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN SO WITH THAT DOW WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ OF PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THIS BILL WITH BROAD THE IDEA WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY LOCAL RESTAURANT AND QUITE HONESTLY IT WAS BROUGHT TO ME BEFORE HIS HAND AND WHAT ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC IN WHATEVER. RESTAURANT THE ISSUE AT HAND WAS A NUMBER PRACTICES THAT SEEM TO GO ON BETWEEN. DELIVERY OUT AND RESTAURANTS. SOME RESTAURANTS ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DELIVERY AFTER SOMEONE HAD A LOT OF WORK TO ENSURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE. ACTUALLY RESTAURANTS DON'T WANT DELIVERY APPS TO DELIVER THEIR FOOD AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR WHY. TAKE CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE THE TIME PERIOD BY WHICH THEIR FOOD GETS- DELIVERED THEY THEY HAVE CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT THEY WANT MATT OR THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DELIVERY DRIVERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY EMPLOYEES OF THE RESTAURANT. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THESE COMPANIES WERE ADVERTISING AND DELIVERING FOOD FROM RESTAURANTS THAT HAD NOT GIVEN PERMISSION OR HAD NO RELATIONSHIP IN FACT ASKED THESE COMPANIES NOT TO DELIVER THEIR FOOT. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON THEIR CLIENTELE AND THE REPUTATION THIS CREATED A PROBLEM. SO WE START SPORTY WITH THE RESTAURANTS WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD DEAL WITH THE SITUATION BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME. RESULTS THAT THAT HAPPENED. AS AS ARE THERE THERE WERE ACTIONS THAT HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THESE DELIVERY DRIVERS POSTING THEIR MENUS ONLINE. SOME OF WHICH WERE THE DELIVERY COMPANIES WOULD THEN GO BACK TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THEY HAD. BASICALLY COOPTED PART OF THEIR CLIENTELE AND SAY OKAY NOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY US FOR THESE DELIVERIES. IN AT THE RESTAURANT SAID NO. THEN THE DELIVERY COMPANY WHO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION AND I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE LET'S SAY YOUR FAVORITE CHINESE RESTAURANT IS DOWN THE STREET. AND IT'S KINGS CHINESE RESTAURANT AND EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE OR MONGOLIAN BEEF EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT YOUR TRADITION. HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN. AND SO YOU CALL. A COMPANY I DON'T WANT TO CALL ANY OF THEM OUT TO HAVE IT DELIVERED HOME FOR YOUR DATE NINE. HAPPENS EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT. WELL I'M BE NUTS TO YOU THEY GET A SPAT WITH THE RESTAURANT AT THE RESTAURANT DOESN'T WANT TO PAY A COMMISSION TO THEM AND SO INSTEAD THE COMPANY BECAUSE IT'S THE DELIVERY COMPANY THAT NOW HAS ALL YOUR INFORMATION YOUR LIKES WHEN YOU ORDER IT HOW MUCH YOU ORDER SAYS. YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'LL GIVE YOU THAT SAME EXACT ORDER BUT FROM KINGS CHINESE FOOD TO. SO THERE YOU SEEN THE RESTAURANT TO TAKE THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THE RESTAURANT HAS NO CONTROL OF THIS SO WE STARTED SPORTING WAYS IN WHICH THE RESTAURANTS COULD HAVE MORE POWER TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR OWN CLIENTS AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ONLY LISTED ON THESE PLATFORMS IF THEY HAVE AN AGREEMENT. WE STARTED OFF WITH A KIND OF SHARING OF INFORMATION BILL NOW WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WOULD RUN INTO SOME PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY THIS COMMITTEE BUT PROBLEMS THAT WE WANTED TO TRY TO GET THROUGH WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT SO WE AGREED TO PULL THAT PIECE BACK AND STILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK ON. WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE CAN CUSTOMERS HAVE THE POWER TO SAY YES THE RESTAURANT CAN HAVE MY INFORMATION. OR CAN THEY OPT OUT OF THAT. BUT BECAUSE OF OUR SHORTENED SCHEDULE IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE COULD WORK ON THIS BILL THAT PIECE WE'VE TAKEN COMPLETELY OUT AND NOW WE JUST HAVE THE REQUIREMENTTHAT THERE BE A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP. AND ALL THIS SAYS IS BASICALLY THAT FOR A DELIVERY PLATFORM TO PUT UP THE MANUAL TO PUT THE LOGO TO ACT LIKE THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RESTAURANT THE DELIVERY COMPANY THAT THERE HAS TO BE A WRITTEN. CONTRACT BETWEEN THE RESTAURANT AND THE DELIVERY COMPANY THIS WILL PREVENT THE RESTAURANTS WHO DON'T WANT TO BE LISTED FROM BEING LISTED IT'S SIMPLE IT'S FAIR AND AS WE MOVE OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC WHEN SO MANY RESTAURANTS HAVE. RELIED IN SOMETIMES TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE SOMETIMES WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE ON DELIVERY AND PICK UP IT'S A WAY FOR THEM TO GAIN SOME CONTROL ESPECIALLY SMALL RESTAURANTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMER AGAIN SO WITH THAT- I ASKED I KNOW THAT THAT'S WILL NEED WORK THE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN. ANALYSIS ARE ISSUES PRIMARILY- FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BECAUSE OF COURSE AGAIN WERE UNDER KIND OF UNUSUAL TIMES- THIS IS WHERE THIS BILL IS NOW THE PRIVACY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN STRIPPED IF WE PUT ANYTHING THAT WHAT WOULD RESULT IN KIND OF THE SHARING OF INFORMATION IT WILL COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AND WE WERE WE SAID WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE. BUT FOR NOW IT'S JUST GOVERNING THAT CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE ON A BILL THAT I THINK MIGHT BE THE FIRST THE BOTH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT THE BILL'S VINCE MOVED AND SECONDED LET'S SELF FIRST TO GO TO OUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION I BELIEVE WE HAVE MR MATSON OF FROM CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION BY WAY OF TELEPHONE. MISTER SUN NOW YOU ARE YOU THERE. YES MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING COULD MAKE YOU THE MAP THAT WILL BE. GOOD MORNING THE MOMENT THAT WOULD DOUBLE YOUR RESTAURANTS THIS NATION. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONSULT BILL AB TWENTY FORTY NINE AS YOU HEARD THE BILL REQUIRED DELIVERY PLATFORMS TO RECEIVE PERMISSION FROM A RESTAURANT PRIOR TO POSTING A RESTAURANT LOGO- MENU ON THE PLATFORM. DOES MIGHT STRIKE YOU AS COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLE JUST GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE WE AGREE HOWEVER THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. IN MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS WITH REGARDS TO THE DELIVERY AFTER THE LOCAL COMMUNITY RESTAURANTS. ROBERTS BUT IT'LL NO MEANS NEW IT'S BEEN- INCREASING AT A RAPID RATE OVER THE YEARS AND IT CERTAINLY GOT MORE PRONOUNCED DURING THE PUBLIC. HEALTH CRISIS WITH WILL BE NINETEEN. IT'S BEING EXAGGERATED. BUT IT DEEPER WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE CRISIS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE RESTAURANTS ARE NOW LIMITED TO ONLY OPERATING WILL TAKE OUT AND DELIVERY. LIKE MANY NEW TECHNOLOGIES THE EMERGENCE OF TO DELIVERY PLATFORMS CREATED IN DIRECT INSTRUCTION AND STATEWIDE FOOD. SERVICE COMMUNITY AND THAT DESTRUCTION IS BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED AS I'VE MENTIONED. THE TYPE BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT THAT'S ON THE WOMAN DEVELOP THIS IS GOING. TO ADDRESS MAY HELP THE FOOD DELIVERY ABSTRACT TRAFFIC TO THEIR WEB PLATFORMS BUT HER RESTAURANT THE CREATES CONFUSION. IT HURTS OUR BRANDS IT HURTS OUR INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS AND IT CERTAINLY THE TRUCK STOP OR OPERATIONS. THE SOME CASES RESTAURANT THIRTY HAVE A DELIVERY SYSTEM IN PLACE OPERATED BY THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES. IF THEIR MENU AND THEN LISTED ON AND I'M NOT AUTHORIZED TO DELIVERY PLATFORM pABOUT THE RESTAURANT AND THE DELIVERY DRIVER WHO SHOWS UP. THE CUSTOMER THE DRIVER IN THE RESTAURANT AND UP LOSING BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT GET THEIR FOOD. SOMETIMES THE DRIVER HE ATE AND THE RESTAURANTS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED IN THE IN THE MEANTIME. ANOTHER IS WITH THIS GOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS MIGHT POST AN OUTDATED MENU. FOR A LOCAL AT THE RESTAURANT. THE CHANCES ARE FOR CUSTOMERS ORDERING WITH AN OUTDATED MENU OR OUTDATED PRODUCT. FROM THE RESTAURANT THE THIRD PARTY APPS WEBSITE. THEN THERE'S GONNA BE ISSUES WITH THEIR FOOD ORDER. THAT LEADS TO CONFUSION BUT NOT JUST CONFUSION AT LEAST THE ANGER AT THE RESTAURANT IT IS VIEWED AS THE RESTAURANTS FALL WHEN THE- BALLPARK AFTER THE TO THE RESTAURANT. AS WE ALL KNOW RESTAURANTS ARE BASING ON OF YOU SENIOR DISTRICT MORE THAN EVER IF YOU RETURNED YOUR DISTRICTS IN MID MARCH TO SERVE YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT RESTAURANTS- AND UNBELIEVABLY UNCHARTERED TERRITORY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH- EPIDEMIC. WE'VE ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN ONE MILLION RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES TO CALIFORNIA'S BEEN LAID OFF- LOW TO BEGINNING THE CORE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN MARCH. IN THE MONTH OF APRIL ESTIMATED REVENUE LOSSES FOR THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY IS OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AT THE SAME TIME THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS ARE EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH AS CONSUMERS ARE REQUIRED STATE HOMES THE MATTER PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT'S WHY IT'S MORE IMPORTANT NEVER TO ENSURE THE RESTAURANT- DELIVERY PLATFORMS ARE OPERATING IN PARTNERSHIP. IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS THE CONSUMER THE RESTAURANT THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM. WHAT A PLATFORM USES A RESTAURANT LOWER MENU THAT APPLIES TO PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES NOT ALL FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS TAKING SUCH AGGRESSIVE TACTICS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS. BY ON UP RIGHT USE OF OUR PRODUCTS. I'M GOOD DELIVERY CLASSROOMS ARE TRUE PARTNERS WITH RESTAURANTS. WE BELIEVE ALL FOOD TO PLATFORM TO COMMIT PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL DELIVERY PLATFORM USES THE RESTAURANT LOGO THE MENU WITHOUT THE PERMISSION THE BENEFIT TO THE TO DELIVERY PLATFORM OUTWEIGHED ANY POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF EXPANDING RESTAURANTS CUSTOMER BASE. THIS BILL HELPS RESTORE THAT EQUITY BACKING OF THE RELATIONSHIP. THE THAT. ARE IF YOU WILL THE MIDDLE PERSON WITH MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS FUNDING IT LONG FRUSTRATED MANY IN THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY WITH THESE TYPES OF PRACTICES. PRACTICES THAT SOME PLATFORMS TO DISMISSIVELY TERMS CLERICAL ERRORS WHEN THEY HAVE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR PRODUCTS ON THEIR WEBSITE. WHILE OTHERS INCLUDING A SAN FRANCISCO MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISOR HAVE TURNED THAT PREDATORY DELIBERATE PRACTICE. THIS BILL AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE THE SIMPLE STEPS. AND HELP GET THE SKILLS OF EQUITY BACK TOWARDS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY RESTAURANT WHICH HAD TREMENDOUS VALUE TO THE STATE'S OVERALL RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. AND WE'RE PROUD THAT THAT SIGNAL THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY BOASTS 60% CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT. OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY AT LEAST PRIOR TO COPE WITH NINETEEN WAS THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN THE SATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HAD THE LARGEST GENERATION IF THEY'LL LOCAL. OF STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAX WHICH WE ALL KNOW NOW ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES ARE GONNA DEPEND ON THE BILL TAX DOLLARS MORE THAN EVER. YOU'LL LIKELY HEAR PROPONENTS THAT THE CURRENT BETTER ALLOWED DRESSES THIS PROBLEM. IT'S BEEN A HANDFUL OF RECENT LAWSUIT CALIFORNIA ILLINOIS AND NEW HAMPSHIRE BETWEEN RESTAURANT- DELIVERY PLATFORMS OVER COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. OTHER STATES DO ARE CONTEMPLATING SIMILAR LEGISLATION THAT THIS INTELLIGENCE PRESENTING TODAY BANNING THE ON OFF RIGHT USED RESTAURANT LOGO OR MANY. FEDERAL COPYRIGHT LAW IS NOT CLEAR AND WOULD NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH PROTECTION THE RESTAURANT. THAT WAS STATING THAT FEDERAL OUT SOME INTIMATE INTERMEDIARY STILL ACTIVE USER MENU ANYWAY. THIS IS CERTAINLY EVIDENCE WE FEEL THAT FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT DETER THE ACTIVITY AND MAY EVEN ALLOW IT. THERE'S LITTLE LEGITIMATE ROLE FOR TH STATE TO DEEM A PRACTICE UNFAIR UNDER STATE LAW AND PROHIBITED. I DON'T THINK ONE CAN ARGUE THAT COPYRIGHT LAWSUIT PROCEEDS ALLSTATE EFFORT LEAST UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES MR SUDDEN QUOTING. GOOD PLACE CUT. PLEASE PROCEDURE OUT OF CONDITIONS MATT AS A AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR THIS COMMITTEE WITH A CALIFORNIA SHOULD STEP UP AND BRING THE EQUITY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESTAURANTS AND FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS. THANK YOU YOU OUTLINED SOME PARAMETERS MOMENTS AGO AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING. FOR THE LAND IS IN WHICH YOU SUGGEST THIS COMMITTEE LOOK AT BILLS IN THE MIDST OF COVERED NINETEEN.

OBVIOUSLY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THE ISSUES WITH THE OFFERING JUDICIARY. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS PLEASE- LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MR OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THIS IS A- AN INTERESTING BILL OBVIOUSLY KIND OF A NEW SITUATION WITH A DATE AMICK BETWEEN FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS AND RESTAURANTS. BUT NOT A NEW ISSUE AT ALL I MEAN WE HAVE A- HUNDRED YEARS OF CASE LAW WHERE- MANUFACTURES OR WHOLESALERS HAVE YOU KNOW WHICH IS THE RATE OF THE RESTAURANT IN THIS CASE HAVE DISPUTES WITH DISTRIBUTORS OF PRODUCTS. AND THE- FEDERAL LAW HAS HAS PRETTY NARROWLY CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF A MANUFACTURER WHOLESALER TO PUT. RESTRICTIONS ON THE- THE USE OF THEIR PRODUCTS BY PEOPLE FURTHER DOWN THE VALUE CHAIN SO I'D I'D START OUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SKEPTICISM. I THINK THE PRIVACY. IMPLICATIONS OF THE BILL ARE VERY INTERESTING AND I HAD TWO QUESTIONS RELATED QUESTIONS LASSEN BOTH THE SAME TIME AND BE INTERESTED TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE SO THE FIRST OF THEM IS THAT- THE BILL AS AMENDED. WE PROHIBITS A FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM FROM USING THE MENU OR THE LOCAL RESTAURANT WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. SO KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES IN MY OPINION SO THE MENU- IS AN INTERESTING CASE BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEING. PUT OUT FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION BY THE RESTAURANT ITSELF SO IT'S ALREADY IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S PRIVATE INFORMATION OF THE RESTAURANT- SO MY QUESTION IS HOW IS THAT NOT FAIR USE BECAUSE MIDDLE OF LARGE BODY OF CASE LAW THAT SAYS THAT THAT. THE GENERALLY THAT'S FAIR USE WITH CAN YOU YOUR PUTTING YOU REDISTRIBUTE SOMETHING THAT ALREADY HAS BEEN PUT OUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BY SOMEONE. AND THEN RELATED QUESTION ON THE LOGO. LOGO IS KIND OF A DIFFERENT ISSUE THAT'S THAT'S UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW WHICH IS FEDERAL LAW SO- YOU KNOW FEDERAL COPYRIGHT LAWS GOVERNS THE USE OF THAT LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S FAIR USE NOT WONDERING HOW. THAT FEDERAL LAWS NOT PREEMPTIVE OF ANY KIND OF A TEMPLATE THAT WE MAKE HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO. RESTRICT THE USE OF THE LOOK THOSE LONG. SO THE FOR. FIRST OF ALL I THINK THE WAY THAT YOU'RE THINKING OF IT MOM IS- LIKE THE MANUFACTURE TO THE DELIVERY YES THIS I KIND OF A UNIQUE SITUATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREPARED HOT FOOD SO COULD BE THOUGHT IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DELIVERY DRIVER IN THE RESTAURANT IS A DELIVERY COMPANY IS ACTUALLY PURCHASING FOOD AND RESELLING IT TO THE CUSTOMER. THAT I THINK EVEN IN EXISTING LAW COULD CREATE OTHER ISSUES WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SURVIVAL FOOD- AND SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A WIDGET OR OR AN ITEM RIGHT IN THE SALE OF IT WE'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT PREPARED FOOD- AS FAR AS THE MENU GOES THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING AN INTERMEDIARY- SUCH AS THE DELIVERY BERNIE. OUT AN AGREEMENT IS WHEN THE RESTAURANT NO LONGER USES THAT MANUAL- THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE RESTAURANT TO TELL THE CUSTOMER THAT BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS NOT DIRECTLY CONTACTING THE RESTAURANT IN THE RESTAURANT IS NOT SOMETIMES EVEN KNOWING THAT EIGHT DELIVERY COMPANY IS OUT THERE- DEAN OLD BANYA. AS SO CUSTOMER I SEE THIS HAVE NO IDEA THAT THIS RESTAURANT HAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DELIVERY COMPANY BECAUSE ARE YOU THERE YET GO FOR INSTANCE IN THERE IS A- SHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES I MAY. HE WRAP ALL. AND IN BECAUSE SOME OF RESTAURANTS BUSINESS IS ALSO DRIVEN BY THINGS LIKE YELP AND THAT YOU KNOW CRITICISM I'M A CUSTOMER I ORDER SOMETHING THAT I ASSUME IS ON THE MENU BECAUSE THAT'S A MAN YOU THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME IT'S NOT I'M NOT TOLD THAT WHEN I ORDER IT IN FACT I'M NOT TOLD THAT TOOK THREE HOURS LATER WHEN MY DELIVERY DOESN'T COM AND THEN I GO ON AND EIGHT NEGATIVE COMMENT ON YELP AFFECTS THAT BUSINESSES. BUSINESS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ENTIRE DISSEMINATION THIS IS HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO I THINK WE'RE ENTERING INTO INTO A NEW. TYPE OF- FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE GOING ON AND SO I THINK TO LOOK AT IT AND KIND OF THAT NARAL OLD MANUFACTURE VERSES SELLER IT IS A LITTLE LIMITED- AND THAT'S- THE I THINK THE MAIN CREST. I WOULD GO THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SAYS THE COPYRIGHT LAWS AREN'T WORKING. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD BE- FEDERALLY PREEMPTED BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT WORKING FOR THESE RESTAURANTS. THANK YOU ARE SO THE IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS AN ENGINE INTERESTING A NEW SITUATION BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE UNIQUE ELEMENTS. THAT ARE BROUGHT. BY THE FACT THAT THIS IS WHAT THE PROVISION OF FOOD I THINK THOSE ARE MIGHT MIGHT BE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS ME TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW FOR LIKE FAIR USE AND COPYRIGHT LAW. I THINK THE ISSUES REALLY AREN'T NEW ISSUES AND YOU KNOW FAIR USE HAS DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE BEFORE YOU BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF. WHAT HAPPENS OF THE MENU HAS CHANGED. AND THAT'S ALSO A FAIR USE ISSUE BECAUSE I MEAN WHAT IF I I'M A BLOGGER AND I REPOST SOMETHING THAT THE NEW YORK TIMES.I HAD AN ARTICLE THIS MORNING AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEW YORK TIMES. DISCOVERS AN ACCURACY IN THE ARTICLE NAY UPDATED AND I HAVEN'T UPDATED MY BLOG IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION AND YET THAT. THAT'S CONSIDERED FAIR USE IN AND JUST TO DO THAT WE OFFER. A LOT OF WORKING WITH THE- DOESN'T. THE MATERIALITY OF WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN PREEMPTED BY PASSING A ROW SEAT VERSIONS SO I JUST HAVE A BIG CONCERNS ABOUT THAT I THINK. WHEN THE DUST SETTLES WE'RE GOING TO DISCOVER THAT THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN LITIGATED ENDLESSLY BEFORE AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF FITTING HAND. SOLUTIONS TO THE YOU PROBLEM INTO WORK OF WHAT'S BEFORE AND I'M NOT. WHAT WE ARE HERE YOU KNOW RISE THAT. BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORKING OUT AND I'LL BE. BACK FOR. THANK THE YOU MUCH EITHER AT THIS KINDS QUESTIONS. BASIC I TO GO. I'M QUESTION EITHER FOR THE AUTHOR OR PERHAPS FOR THE- RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION- SO WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL COUPLE QUESTIONS AND WHAT'S THE ABILITY UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR A RESTAURANT THAT DOESN'T WANT THAT THESE DELIVERY PLATFORMS- TO COME INTO THAT REST ESTABLISHMENT TO JUST SAY WE DON'T. ACCEPT DELIVERIES FROM COMPANY X. Y. Z. AND THEN RELATEDLY- IN CASES WHERE RESTAURANTS HAVE REACHED OUT TO THESE COMPANIES AND SAID WE DON'T WANT YOU TO LIST US ON YOUR PLATFORM WHAT IS THE RESPONSE GENERALLY BEEN TO THE AGREE OR THEY REFUSE. KILEY THE MAP BUTTON WITH THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- MISTER WILL NOT YEAR QUESTIONS AS WELL- REALLY WHAT WHAT THE ISSUE IS IT HERE AND CERTAINLY NO MENUS TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION MENUS. ARE OUT IN PUBLIC- ADMITS GONZALEZ STATED. THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS WITHOUT CONSENT TO JEFF THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR RESTAURANTS AND THE- THIRD PARTY ENTITIES WHICH IN MANY OF THESE CASES IS NOT ACCURATE. AND IT MATTERS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE OF THE REASONS IS WE'RE SERVING PREPARED FOOD. WE ARE REGULATED RIGHTFULLY SO BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE CONDITION THAT SUIT. IN THESE CASES WE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF THE FOOD AND SO IT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. COMMUNITY ALSO. AT THE RELATED TO PAIR. FOOD AND OUR NEED. TO KNOW AND WHO IS THIS IT. WITHOUT CONSENT OF OUR PRODUCTS ON THE WEB. WE DON'T KNOW THAT. MR KILEY IT TENDS TO BE A LARGER ISSUE WITH THE SMALLER INDEPENDENT RESTAURANT AND WE HAVE HEARD REPEATEDLY FOR YEARS. WITH AN UPTICK IN COMPLAINT LATELY THAT THEY DO TRY TO SOLVE THIS ONE ON ONE WITH THIRD PARTY ENTITY. THIRD PARTY ENTITY USUALLY RESPONSE WITH SOME SORT OF IT'S A CLERICAL ERROR WILL FIX IT AND THAT THAT THE GENERALLY HAPPENS IN SO THE SMALLER RESTAURANTS THAT DON'T HAVE THE LEVERAGE. OF THE LARGER CHAIN RESTAURANTS. HAVE LET THE BILL OF THE SORT OF. YOU KNOW MUSCLE THEIR WAY THROUGH. AND SO IT ENDS UP BEING. THE CREW BUT THE SMALLER INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS HAVE JUMPED THROUGH. OP NOTE THAT. DAMAGE TO THEIR BRAND. AND QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES WITH THEIR FOOD. I GUESS THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT MIGHT. IT WOULD BE. MORE LIKELY TO- AGREED TO HAVE THEIR- INFORMATION ON ESTABLISHED PLATFORM SO THAT COULD LEAD TO HIGHER BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN THE DELIVERY MARKET DO YOU SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MISTER KELLY I'M NOT TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION. WELL I MEAN IF THIS PASSES AND YOU HAVE TO GET EXPRESS PERMISSION THEN IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT RESTAURANTS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO GRANTED TECH COMPANIES WE'VE ALL HEARD OF LIKE A GROUNDHOG OR WHAT HAVE YOU- SO THAT COULD BE A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR LESS ESTABLISH DELIVERY COMPANIES WHO AREN'T ABLE TO. I HAVE A WIDER SELECTION AVAILABLE. I WOULD ARGUE JUST THE OPPOSITE ACTUALLY I'M SORRY- I WOULD ASK YOU TO IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE THIS WILL. ACTUALLY ALLOW THE MARKET TO WORK ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE- THE BIG CARRIERS ARE TAKING A LARGE PERCENTAGE. OF THE OVERALL BILL FROM THESE RESTAURANTS WHERE A SMALLER NEW START UP COMPANY COULD COME IN AND OFFER FAR LASSEN BECAUSE IT'S A WRITTEN CONTRACT AND THAT'S WELL ESTABLISHED BEFORE HAND. IT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MARKET TO WORK. SO THAT THAT'S IN CASES WHERE THERE ACTUALLY AGREEING TO PAY THE RESTAURANT RIGHT SO THERE IS BY DEFINITION RT PERMISSIONS FROM GRANT. WELL THAT THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS RESTAURANTS GET PUT IN POSITION SPECIALLY SMALL RESTAURANTS OF STARTING OUT BE LISTED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. AND THEN THEIR CUSTOMERS BEING RELIANT ON THESE- DELIVERY PLATFORMS WITH EIGHTY AT IT AND THEN THE DELIVERY PLATFORM COMES TO THE RESTAURANT. IN ALMOST NOT COURSE THE FASHION- REQUIRES THE RESTAURANT TO BUY IN. TO THEIR PERCENTAGE BEING TAKEN OR TO TAKE THEIR CUSTOMERS ELSEWHERE THIS IS WHERE- UNFORTUNATELY KIND OF THIS BIG BUSINESS HAS IT HAS CORRUPTED ON THE ABILITY OF SMALL RESTAURANTS TO HAVE THE DECISION. SO IT STARTS OFF AS- AT WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND THEN THE- COMPANY I DON'T WANNA NAY MANY OF THEM COME IN. AND SAY YOU NEEDS NOW AGREE TO THIS PERCENTAGE TO SIGNING UP FOR US AND THIS IS A PERCENTAGE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE. WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BY SAYING THAT'S UP FRONT IN THE BEGINNING DO YOU WANT TO SIGN ON IT NOT IT ALSO ALLOWS SMALL START UP COMPANIES TO SAY WE'RE OFFERING LESS IT ALSO ALLOWS THE RESTAURANT TO MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION ABOUT WHETHER IT'S CHEAPER. OR MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES TO BE DELIVERING- THAT FOOD AT SOME RESTAURANT STILL STILL HAVE BEEN IN THIS- AT PANDEMIC ENVIRONMENT WHERE. A LOT OF RESTAURANTS HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THAT GOES INTO NOT. TO SIMPLY ALLOW TAKE OUT RATHER THAN DELIVERY AS A AS A WAY TO- INSURE THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF QUALITY CONTROL. AND THAT WAS OUR SENATOR DID U. S. C. IS THERE AN ABILITY I JUST TO SAY WE- DON'T WANT THESE DELIVERY COMPANIES TO COME IN AND PICK UP FOOD FROM A RESTAURANT APART FROM WHETHER OR NOT THEIR INFORMATION IS LISTED ON THE PLATFORMS. YOUR MISTER KELLY I THINK ANY RESTAURANT COULD DENY SERVICE THAN IN ANY CONTACT- THE ISSUE HERE IS. THAT YOU KNOW THESE ORDERS THEY THEY COME IN A- NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. AND ALL MISS GONZALEZ IS ASKING FOR. WHICH WE APPRECIATE. IT SOME LEVEL OF CONSENT FROM THE RESTAURANT. SO THAT THE IMPLIED RELATIONSHIP TO THE PUBLIC. IS TRUE OR- IN MANY CASES WHICH MAKES THE PRICE PEOPLE THERE ARE A LOT OF INDEPENDENT RESTAURANT THAT ACTUALLY DO NOT. WANT HARD TO DELIVER IT THEIR PRODUCT MAY NOT LEND ITSELF WELL TO TRAVEL OR THEY MAY NOT JUST BE ABLE TO DO THE LOGISTICS OF IT OR THERE MAY BE A NUMBER ABOUT THE RECENT SO. THERE SEEMS TO BE DRIVING A CONVERSATION TO SOME DEGREE THE PRESUMPTION THAT RESTAURANT ONE OF THE LIST AND IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T AND SO WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING. FOR SOME FORMAL PROCESS. REALLY LOW FARE OF CONSENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY AND GO AHEAD. JUST A BRIEF COMMENT I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL YOU KNOW IT'S A SINGLE ANECDOTE BUT IT HAPPENED TO A SMALL RESTAURANT THAT I LOVE. SIX OR SEAT RESTAURANT SIX TABLE RESTAURANT THEY COULDN'T HANDLE THE CAPACITY WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO THEM AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THEY COULDN'T SERVE THEIR CLIENTELE IN THE WAY THEY WANTED AND THEY COULDN'T GET OUT OF IT. AND SO I THINK THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM THAT HER SMALL RESTAURANT SOMEWHERE IN A TIME WHERE WE AS A BODY NEEDS DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO GET RESTAURANTS BACK UP AND RUNNING IN A WAY THAT IS WORK FOR THEM AND WORK TO CAL. CAN THANK MUCH. A MISTER GOING AT FIRST I MEAN THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES BECAUSE- IN DURING THIS COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS CERTAINLY RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED GREATLY- BEAN. ONLY ABLE TO DO TAKE OUT AND DELIVERY- HAS BEEN A HUGE IMPACT TO THEM AND THEN MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON THE SERVICES- TO GET DELIVERIES YOU KNOW DURING THIS TIME SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS A HELPFUL TOOL OUT THERE THAT IS THAT IS COME UP IN SOCIETY IN THE MARKET. OF ALLOWING THESE. DELIVERIES AND I THINK IT HELPS YOU KNOW AND IT HELPS RESTAURANTS AND IT'S HELPS THE CONSUMER. BUT I MEAN I'VE IN LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY HERE. IT IS NOW IN QUESTION- AND I THINK SOME OF THIS CAN BE DEALT WITH IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS YOU AS YOU SUGGEST BECAUSE WE GET INTO SOME LEGAL ISSUES ABOUT COPYRIGHT LAW AND- SUCH A THOSE CAN BE HANDLED THERE- BUT IT IS INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT- THE ON THE ONE HAND I THINK YOU MIGHT SAY. WHO WHO WHO WHO WHO WOULD NOT WANT FREE ADVERTISING RIGHT- THAT THERE'S A COMPANY OUT THERE IS GOING TO PUT YOUR BUSINESS'S NAME OUT THERE AND NOT CHARGE YOU FOR IT. IS NOT A GOOD THING FOR A BUSINESS. YEAH HOWEVER. AS BEEN POINT ON ON. THIS TESTIMONY IS SORT OF SUEDE MY- FEELINGS ON THIS IS OKAY WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED FOR THOSE ORDERS RIGHT AND YOU AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD. THAT TIME AND THEN. SOMEBODY SUGGESTED WELL YOU COULD JUST SAY HEY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH YOU OKAY BUT NOW THAT CUSTOMER DOESN'T GET. THE PRODUCT THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING AND THEY AND THEY WERE ASSUMING THERE WAS SOME SORT OF RELATIONSHIP WHO DOES THAT LOOK BAD ON. IT LOOKS BAD ON THE RESTAURANT. IT LOOKS BAD ON THE- DELIVERY COMPANY TO. BUT IT LOOKS BAD ON THE RESTAURANT. AS A THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH- AND SO THAT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY ASK FOR- AND- SO I THINK THAT IS A- AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND- I'LL COME IN A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT'S NOT BEFORE US- BUT THAT. THE AUTHOR STARTED OUT WITH THIS OKAY WHO- WHO WHO'S- TUMORS ARE THESE. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR US I MEAN IT'S NOT BEFORE US YET BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. IS I THINK IN A LOT OF CASES IF YOU'RE IN YOUR HOME JURISDICTION I MEAN IF YOU'RE IN. YOUR YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE YOU ALREADY HAVE RESTAURANTS THAT YOU LIKE. AND YOU'RE ALREADY A CUSTOMER OF THAT RESTAURANT YOU MY ORDERS TO THESE- THROUGH THESE DELIVERIES TO GET THAT BUT TO ME THAT FEELS A LOT MORE LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY THEIR CUSTOMER- AND SO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT BELONGS TO THE RESTAURANT- WHERE IT STARTS MOVING OUTWARD IS MAYBE. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IT WILL THEN. DELIVERY COMPANIES GIVING YOU A LOT OF CHOICES THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM MAYBE THE START TO BECOME MORE OF THEIR CUSTOMER AND IS THAT THEIR DATA AS OPPOSED TO THE RESTAURANTS- WHEN YOU GO WHEN YOU GO VISIT A LOCATION WHEN I GO DOWN TO SAN DIEGO. MAY FOR EXAMPLE AND I'M LIKE HEY WHERE'S A GOOD RESTAURANT I MIGHT USE ONE OF THESE APPS. TWO HEY RECOMMENDED ME A GOOD A GOOD PLACE TO GET. SOME GOOD FOOD RIGHT. THEN IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE LIKE HEY THIS IS A SERVICE THEY ARE PROVIDING A MUSEUM MORE THERE SO IT IS. NO THERE IS SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS THAT WE GOT TO DELVE INTO. AND AGAIN THIS IS A USEFUL TOOL WE DON'T WANT TO. UNDULY BURDEN IT. BUT YOU KNOW IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST SOME KIND OF. RELATIONSHIP ABOLISHED. BETWEEN THE RESTAURANT AND THE SERVICE AHEAD OF TIME AND I THINK THAT'S- I THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL IS HEADING SO. AND I THINK WE NEED A WE DO ARE THERE ARE LEGAL ISSUES ARE GOING AFTER ADDRESS BUT I THINK THOSE COULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND HER TEAM FOR. THE WORK THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS BILL. AS WELL AS- THE AGREEMENT TO REMOVE THE TOP PORTION OF THE BILL. THAT DEALT WITH PRIVACY WHICH PRESENTS SOME PROBLEMS OF FOR THE COMMUNITY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT AND- AND ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL THE WHEN IT. IS WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER. AND AS WE KNOW AND WE HEARD EARLIER. RESTAURANT INDUSTRY HAS REALLY SUFFERED. A THE MOST IN A- SALE. JOB LOSS IS A- YOU KNOW SINCE THE I. SO ALL AT THE SAME. THE USE OF THESE. DELIVERY PLATFORMS HAVE SEEN. A DRAMATIC INCREASE. AS PEOPLE CALTRAIN PLACE OKAY. I'D REALLY HOPES TO ENSURE THAT AN EQUITABLE AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN RESTAURANTS AND DELIVERY PLATFORMS. WHICH REALLY SEEN CRITICAL FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE- FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY. GOING TO PANDEMIC SO- WITH THE AMENDMENT- THAT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED TODAY HI WILL BE SUPPORTED THE BILL. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU. I WILL I JUST WANT TO TOUCH BASE WITH. BUT YOU'RE GALLAGHER SAID. IN A- THOUGHT BUT I'VE BEEN. LOOKING AT THE CENTER TIME THAT QUESTION OF WHO IS THE CUSTOM IN WHO. WHO SHOULD THAT THE CUSTOMER HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH AND IT'S COMPLICATED. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS CRISIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT LESS COMPLICATED. BECAUSE I KEEP THINKING ABOUT- THE SMALL RESTAURANTS THAT ARE GOING TO SLOWLY COME OPEN UP RIGHT MAYBE ONE OR TWO- SEATS AVAILABLE THERE. TO WANT TO BRING PEOPLE AND SO THAT THEY CAN HIRE WAIT STAFF SO THEY CAN HIRE BACK THEIR STOCK. THEY COMMUNICATE WITH THE PEOPLE AT HOME THAT HAVE BEEN ORDERING THROUGH- AN APT. IF THEY'RE NO LONGER IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW- IT IT'S A BERRIER ALMOST TWO. OPENING FOR A LOT OF SO. STRONG EARLY WE MAY OR MAY NOT GET TO A RESOLUTION DOES ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE PRIVACY CONCERNS IT'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO GET TO BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. THAT'S WHY I'VE OFFERED- TO PULL THAT PIECE OUT- TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL AS- COMMITTEE STAFF IF IT IF IT MOVES FORWARD- INTO THE SENATE. AND THE WORK ON THE JUDICIARY PEACE BUT I THINK THIS IS SIMPLE AS WRITTEN AND THIS BILL JUST SAYS THERE SHOULD BE A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP- AS I THINK ALL CONSUMERS BELIEVE THAT THERE IS- AS- RESTAURANTS ARE ASKING FOR- AND- IT'S NOT TOO MUCH OF A BARRIER TO ASK. THESE COMPANIES TO CREATE. I RELATE WITH THESE WERE. BEFORE AVERAGE. CAN BUY THEIR FOR OR OR CHIU FROM THERE MAY WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. OF WHY I THIS BILL IS GOING TO. OR IS SET UP IT IS. HE SAID THE BILL HAS BEEN AND SO DOWN MAN SECRETARY WOULD YOU CALL WILL FORM. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE IS FLOOR CHAO HI. KILEY BAUER-KAHAN.

SO I THINK I A WILL PROP- I THINK THAT'S A- THAT'S A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE- BILL A CA FIVE. I WILL I WILL EXERCISE MY PREROGATIVE SO IS THE CHAIR TO GO TO MEMBERS IN THE COMMITTEE AND I BELIEVE- MISTER BERMAN THIS NEXT TO HE HAS A BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT ELEVEN. AND LET ME REITERATE FOR THOSE WISHING TO REGISTER THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION BY PHONE I DO ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO CALL AND NOW. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS TESTIMONY JUST TO AVOID ANY DELAYS THE PHONE NUMBER AGAIN IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. SO WITH THAT YEAH WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANYTIME YOU'RE READY POLICE BEGAN THANK YOU MISTER SUN COLLEAGUES LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS DEEMED DETAILED OPENPAGES NINE AND IN THE ANALYSIS. AB ELEVEN WOULD STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW. BY ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS CAN SUBSCRIBE FOR GOODS AND SERVICES ONLINE. THEY CAN CANCEL ONLINE AND THAT CAN DO SO WITHOUT DELAY OR HAVING TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS. IN ADDITION. AB TWENTY IT'LL WOULD REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS BEFORE A FREE GIFT TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL OR DISCOUNTED RATE EXPIRES. IN RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC RECESSION TRIGGERED BY COVERED NINETEEN MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ARE SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO SAVE MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN BUY FOOD AND PAY RENT. ONE OF THE FIRST IS THEY WILL TURN IT IS TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES THAT THEY REALLY ARE YOU NEVER USE. UNFORTUNATELY MANY BUSINESSES USE A VARIETY OF TACTICS TO MAKE CANCELLING SUBSCRIPTIONS INCONVENIENT CONFUSING AND TIME CONSUMING. OR OTHERWISE DIFFICULT. JUST RECENTLY A MEMBER OF MY STAFF TRIED TO CANCEL HER NEW YORK TIMES SUBSCRIPTION ONLINE WHICH YOU SUBSCRIBE TO ONLINE AND THE ONLY ONLINE CANCELLATION OFFICE AND WHAT'S THE CHAT ONLINE WITH A CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE. HOWEVER NO REPRESENTATIVES WERE AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME WHICH WAS DURING NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS. THEREFORE HER ONLY OPTION FOR CANCER THE CALL OR TEXT A CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE. THIS EXPERIENCE IN OTHERS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA LAW TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AT A TIME WHEN THE MORE AND MORE CAN NO LONGER CAN AFFORD. THESE SERVICES. DURING THE COUNTING IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT CONSUMERS CAN EASILY CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT THEY MAY NO LONGER BE ABLE TO AFFORD. IT IS ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT CONSUMERS HAVE THESE PROTECTIONS GIVEN THE RECENT EXPLOSION OF FREE TRIALS AND PROMOTIONAL OFFERS BEING OFFERED IN THE RESPONSE THE COVERT NINETEEN.

JANUARY. CHAIR OF THE BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WE DO HAVE ONE MORE ONE MOMENT FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE A MOMENT IN SUPPORT AND STEPHANIE MATTHEW PLEASE GO AHEAD. KIDDING MELANIE IS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND THE COURT. THANK YOU. AND THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN YOU YEAH HELLO SO I HAVE NOT FELT TRAVEL HOW THINGS MATT. WELCOME MISTER BUSH TRUMP PLEASE GO AHEAD I'M- HOW DOES FOR THE CONFUSION GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MATTHEW BELTRAME A COMMON ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. I LIKE TAKE A FEW MOMENTS IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO EIGHT ONE ONE I SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I SERVED AS AN ATTORNEY IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE FOR THE PAST NINETEEN YEARS. ELEVEN OF WHICH I'VE EXCLUSIVELY HANDLE CASES INVOLVING A WHITE COLLAR CRIME AND CONSUMER FRAUD MOST OF THEM CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES PROSECUTED BY MY OFFICE MOSTLY INVOLVE COMPLAINT THE FALSE ADVERTISING AND UNLAWFUL AND FRAUDULENT BUSINESS PRACTICES. THEY IMPLICATE COMPANIES LARGE AND SMALL THAT YOU BUSINESS IN OUR STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. ON THE STATUTES THAT FREQUENTLY ARISE IN THESE CASES IS CALIFORNIA'S AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN SIX OH TWO. AS YOU KNOW THIS WAS AND REMAINS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION. ALTHOUGH AUTOMATIC RENEWAL CONTRACT CAN BE A SOURCE OF CONVENIENT FOR CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES. THEY ARE ALSO IN MY EXPERIENCE TRAPS FOR THE UNWARY SOMETIMES RESULTING IN CONSUMERS INCURRING MONTHS AND YEARS OF ON NOTICED CREDIT CARD CHARGES. THIS IS A PARTICULARLY WORRISOME PROBLEM NOW IN THE ERA OF CORONAVIRUS AND SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS. WERE MILLION HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND CAN ILL AFFORD TO PAY FOR THINGS THEY DON'T USE OR WANT. THE LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES COMPANIES THAT WISH TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH CONSUMERS TO MAKE DISCLOSURES ENTERTAINED AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. I HAVE PERSONALLY HANDLE THE NUMBER OF CIVIL CASES IN WHICH COMPANIES WERE ALLEGEDTO HAVE VIOLATED THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW INCLUDING ACTIONS AGAINST LARGE COMPANIES SUCH AS SKYPE AND DROPBOX AN ACTIVITY BANDAGE. IN MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE HAVE BROUGHT ACTIONS AGAINST OTHER WELL KNOWN COMPANIES SUCH AS THE HARMONY AND STAMPS DOT COM TO NAME. JUST A COUPLE. ALL OF THESE CASES I JUST MENTION RESULTED IN STIPULATED JUDGMENT. WHICH REQUIRED THE COMPANY IN QUESTION TO MAKE CHANGES TO THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES. THROUGHOUT THE FALL THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW. EACH CASE ALSO RESULTED IN FILL PENALTIES AND POTENTIAL CONSUMER RESTITUTION. THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW HAS BEEN A REAL ASSET THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. IT APPEARED TO ME THAT OVER TIME. APPELLEE COUNCIL BUSINESSES HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOWING IT. THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL ARE CURRENTLY WRITTEN HOWEVER IS NOT PERFECT. THERE ARE SOME HOLD THAT REMAIN. FOR EXAMPLE NOTHING IN THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES COMPANIES TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE CHARGED EITHER AT THE END OF A FREE TRIAL PERIOD OR AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL. IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS THESE DAYS ARE COMPLETED ONLINE AND VIA EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS. SUCH NOTIFICATIONS WOULD BE INEXPENSIVE AND EASY TO ADMINISTER. ALSO ALTHOUGH THE STATUTE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN REQUIRES A COMPANY THAT OFFERS AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL CONTRACT ONLINE. ALSO TO ALLOW CANCELLATION ONLINE NOTHING PREVENT THE COMPANY FOR MAKING CANCELLATION TRICKY DIFFICULT OR TIME CONSUMING. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUPPORT AB TWO EIGHT ONE ONE BECAUSE IT STRENGTHENS THIS IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW BY HELPING TO PLUG THE HOLES. FIRST IT REQUIRES THAT A BUSINESS NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS AT THE CONCLUSION OF A FREE CREEK GIFT OR FREE TRIAL PERIOD. BEFORE HIS OR HER CREDIT CARD IS CHARGED THE FULL AMOUNT TO LET THEM KNOW HOW TO CANCEL. GIVING KERN CONSUMERS SUCH NOTICE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW WHEN AND HOW MUCH THEY WILL BE CHARGED AS WELL TO PAINT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CANCELLATION PROCESS. PROCESS SECOND THE BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL AUTOMATIC RENEWAL CONTRACT THAT WILL. WITHOUT HAVING TO ENGAGE IN STEPS THAT WILL IMPAIR OR RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO DO SO. THIS IS NOT MERELY AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE. IN OUR INVESTIGATION. WE HAVE SEEN MANY EXAMPLES OF BUSINESSES FORCING CONSUMERS TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS. I MAKING THEM COMPLETE SEVERAL ON NECESSARY STEPS IN ORDER TO CANCEL THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL SERVICE. THESE INCLUDE FORCING THEM TO ENGAGE IN ONLINE CHAT WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS MAY TENTH TO DISSUADE THEM FROM CANCELING. HIDING A CANCELLATION HYPERLINK IN A WEB PAGE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ARE NOT INTUITIVE. REQUIRING CONSUMERS TO TAKE A SURVEY OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE A REASON FOR CANCELLATION. OFFERING NARROW WINDOWS OF TIME IN WHICH CANCELLATION AS POSSIBLE. AND REQUIRING TUMORS TO GO TO MULTIPLE STEPS. TO PROCESS THE CANCELLATION MY COLLEAGUES REPORT HAVING SEEN CASES THAT INVOLVE AS MANY AS THIRTEEN SEPARATE STEPPED INCLUDING MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO PERSUADE THE CONSUMER TO REMAIN WITH THE SERVER. THIS BILL WILL RENDER THESE PRACTICES UNLAWFUL. ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE'S SO ON THE LINE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE A COMMENT OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE. ZERO TOM KEPT PARTY TO ONE ZERO. AND WE HAVE NOBODY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT LET'S TURN TO THE OPPOSITION I BELIEVE- IS CORNY JENSEN FROM TECHCONNECT IS ON THE LINE AS WELL AS SHARP MUHAMMAD FROM CAL CHAMBER. HI YOU ON THE LINE. DIRECTOR CARY ACT THAT THE COURT IN JENSEN LIKE TECH THAT AND TAKE THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY EIGHT ELEVEN AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AND BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORED THAT CAN INTENT OF THE BILL- BUT YOU WORRY ABOUT THE WORKABILITY OF MANY OF THE PROVISIONS. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN PACKED THAT WORKED WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG ON HIS AT THE THREE THIRTEEN WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT JULY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN TWO YEARS AGO- AND TECHNET EVENTUALLY TOOK A NEUTRAL POSITION ON THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT WOULD NOT COVER BURDEN BUSINESS SAYS AND WHAT ENSURE CONSUMERS WERE IN POWER TO CANCEL SERVICES EASILY. AB TWENTY EIGHT ELEVEN WOULD BALAMAND THAT LANGUAGE AND I'LL QUICKLY COVER TO CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE FIRST THE BILL REQUIRES IMMEDIATE CANCELLATION WE WANT TO ENSURE IT WOULD NOT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE TO BE USED FREE TRIAL OR SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT THAT ALLOW THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. ALL RIGHT. BUT HAVE A RIGHT CANCEL. ALLOWING A CAN TO CAN'T NUMBER OF THE TERM TO CREATE GET CONCERNS FOR BUSINESS AND WE THAT THE MORE PER. CLAIRE THAT THE TAKE A FACT THAT THE END OF THE BILLING CYCLE SECOND THE BILL REQUIRED THE BUSINESS TO ALLOW CONSUMER KIDS TERMINATE AT WILL AND I FOUND AGING AND ANY FURTHER THAT AS THE LANGUAGE STAND CURRENTLY IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO REQUIRE A PMR TO AUTHENTICATE THEMSELVES FOR ALLOWING A CANCELLATION IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT IN THE MIND CONTACT FOR BUSINESSES CAN VERIFY THAT A PERSON IS INDEED AUTHOR TO CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION. AND SOMETIMES BUSINESSES TO ASK NUMBER TO FIND INTERNET OR VERIFIED BY ANOTHER METHOD TO RESOLVE THE CANCELLATION OUR CLASS. ALTHOUGH THIS PLANE WOULD LIMIT THE OF THE OF A COMPANY TO ENGAGE DIRECT WTH THEIR CUSTOMER. TO BE GIVEN IN OUR- TO RESOLVE ISSUE OR DRAFT THE CUSTOMERS NEED. OFTEN CONSUMERS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TYPE OF DIALOGUE WITH THE BUSINESS NEGOTIATE A BETTER PRICE OR DIRECT THE STAR MAY HAVE WITH THE SERVICE. NOT ALLOWING THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ANY FURTHER STAT WE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAMSTRING BOTH BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS- AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OFF THEIR ON THESE ISSUES AND HELP THE WILL BE ABLE TO DROP PARKING CAN'T. CONCERNING MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF IT IS MISTER MOHAMMED ON THE LINE. BUT I AM.

ISSUES WITH ALL OUR FIRST I WANTED TO ADDRESS THIS REQUIREMENT THE BILL REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH A NOTICE EXPLAINING HOW TO CANCEL AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OFFER CONTINUOUS AUTHOR BUT THE REQUIRED. NOTICE MUST BE PROVIDED TO THE AT THE THREE DAY THAT ABOUT SEVEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE ALL WORK BUT IF INDIVIDUATION RUN OFFERS LESS THAN THREE DAYS LONG OF NOT REALLY BE POSSIBLE TO OPERATE READING NOT AS AN ADDITION TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. MANY BILL. OFFICE BY ME. SO THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES. MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR. AFTER SUBSCRIPTIONS BY MAIL TO GO THOSE NOTICE. OUT AND HOW. ME THOSE TIME DEADLINE AS- GIVEN THE MAIL SYSTEM UNDER THE CURRENT. AND UP INTO. GIVEN THE KERN ECONOMIC SITUATION THE COST OF OPERATION. IN THE- NO WITHIN BURDEN FOR THE FIRST BECAUSE REQUIRED THEM TO CONNECT WE- AND PERSONNEL TOWARDS ME. CHANGE TAKING. CALL THANK. AND THOSE CONCERNS THINK THAT THEY STILL IS. THAT NEW TO BE. ADDRESSED AND THE LIGHT THAT. WILL BE ON OUT OF MY CHECKING POINT IS THAT. LINK BUT REQUIREMENTS. THE LANGUAGE WILL ALSO REQUIRE THERE TO BE A DIRECT LINK BODY. TO CANCEL OUR SUBSCRIPTION THEIR SERVICES ONLINE NOW THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS TO BE A DIRECT. LINK BUTTON RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF EMPOWERING THE SAME. CONCEPTUAL ALTERNATIVES ARE TECHNIQUE DIRECT LINK ARE BOUGHT IN FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CONCERN CHOICE IN POWER BY. THE TALK SWITCH IN AND OP OR BY SOME OTHER CREATIVE INTO THE USER CAN. THAT NOT TECH A LAY OR BY. BUT ONE CAN ABOUT HOW THE THING AND GOAL COULD ACHIEVED. BY VARIOUS IMPOSSIBLE EVEN MORE.

LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MISTER BERMAN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK YOU'RE RAISING A NORMALLY I AM VERY SKEPTICAL OF LEGISLATION THAT IT ATTEMPTS TO INSERT ITSELF INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A BUYER AND A SELLER BUT I THINK THAT. GOVERNMENT HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO FILL IN ENSURING THAT FREE MARKETS FUNCTION AND EXIST AND IN THIS CASE I THINK THAT THE DEFINITION OF A FREE MARKET IS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WILLING BUYER AND A WILLING SELLER AND IF THE BUYER IS NOT WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE OF THE THAT RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION BECAUSE THEY ARE ON AWARE OF IT. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO I MEAN I SEE WE HAVE A OPPOSE RECOMMENDATION ON MY ANALYSIS HERE BUT I REALLY THINK THAT YOU'RE RAISING AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH. BOB I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED SOME GOOD POINTS AND IN PARTICULAR IF WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS- I THINK THAT THE POINT ABOUT- VERY SHORT DESCRIPTIONS IT IS A GOOD ONE IF YOU HAVE A ONE DAY SUBSCRIPTION AND THERE'S THIS IS DESCRIBE EITHER ONE AT A TIME. I'LL BE DAY NOT IS NOT A TO HAVE THAT. ARE I THINK THE A GOOD CASE WAS MY RAISED ABOUT A SOME REASONABLE REQUIRE ESTABLISHED AND IT'S AN SUMER THAT'S SUBSCRIPTION SO YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL I WAS A LAST MINUTE AMEND. BUT I THINK IT NEEDS SOME TO AND TURN OF THE RE STAFF THAT THE- BLAUT CAKE YEAH. PROVIDE. THOSE I HAD. TO CANCEL OF THE SERVICE. ALSO TO THE CONCERNED JUST HEARD ABOUT. ABOUT ALTERNATE METHOD OF CANCELLATION FIRST IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ELECT. RELATION WITH A CO. THAT'S REALLY NOT ADDRESS THE BILL I THINK THAT THOSE THINGS ARE- ARE THINGS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE. A FINISH UP AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SO ARE THOSE THINGS THAT THAT YOU WERE PLANNING TO WORK ON WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS YES ABSOLUTELY. THE COMMENTS IN THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN A REYES BY THE OPPOSITION WITH EIGHT SAT LAST FRIDAY- WITH I THINK EVERYBODY WHO WHO WAITED IN. IN OPPOSITION TODAY AND- TOTALLY AGREE WITH SOME OF THEIR POINT. AND ITS C. CONCERNED WITH SOME OTHER POINTS- ON THINGS LIKE. MORE ACNE TROLL OPTION FOR CANCELING. OPEN THAT AS ONE MAKE SURE THAT THE SOLUTION ISN'T. DOESN'T HAVE LOOPHOLES THAT ARE SO BIG YOU CAN DRIVE A TRUCK THROUGH- IT HAS BEEN DELICATELY BUT- ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND- KIND OF. STRIKE A BETTER BALANCE OKAY WILL. BE WITH A COMMITMENT I THINK I CAN BE SUPPORTIVE. A IS THE BILL OVER HERE AND THE. AFTER POLLUTION ON THOSE WITH THE PARTICULARS PROJECT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MEDINA GO AT THE- THANK THE- FOR I THINK A VERY. SENSE BILL I. THINK THAT MANY TIMES SENIORS ESPECIALLY. ARE OPEN TO. NOT REALIZING THAT WHAT THEY HAVE- COMMITTED TO. AND THEN AS I THINK ONE OF YOUR- SPONSORS OF THE BILL SAID- YEAR AFTER YEAR. PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE REALLY NOT USING AND NOT BEING AWARE THAT THEIR PAIN THAT ON THEIR- ON THEIR CREDIT CARD. SO THANK YOU MUCH FOR BRING THIS BILL FOR BRIDGES AT. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY GO AHEAD PLEASE HELLO MISTER BERMAN SO I YEAH I LIKED- SENATOR HERTZBERG'S BILL AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILLS WHILE AND- I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW IT IS AN ANTI ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS. AND THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW POLICIES THAT ARE PRO MARKET ARE NOT ALWAYS NEARLY EMBRACE BY- INCUMBENT BUSINESSES AND- SO I'M MAD AT. PRETTY CONFIDENT GOING ALONG WITH THE TODAY MY BROAD CONCERN IS JUST THAT IF THIS BECOMES SORT OF A- BASIS FOR MASS LITIGATION AND YOU HAVE- COMPANIES OR WEBSITES THAT ARE. NOT TECHNICALLY COMPLYING WITH EVERY- PART OF THE BILL THEN SUDDENLY- THERE'S ANOTHER CLASS ACTION NINE SO THAT IT CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME ASSURANCE THERE THAT MAYBE THEY'LL BE SOME SAFE HARBORS ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT DIDN'T MISS VIOLATIONS DON'T RESULT IN HUGE LIABILITY. I CAN SAY THAT THAT MY INTENT IS NOT TO CREATE LAWSUITS- TO HAVE A CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO. CREATE YES THAT THE- EITHER SAFE HARBORS ARE OR OTHER IDEAS- BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT MY INTENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL COMMENTS MR GALLAGHER AT PLEASE- WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE BROUGHT UP BY A POSITION OF. IF FOR ALLOWING CANCELLATION. IN THE MIDDLE OF A CYCLE YOUR ALLOWING THAT TO BASICALLY THIS AND AT THE END OF THAT CYCLE IS THAT SOME YOUR WORKI THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I DO AGREE WITH.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY. OKAY THANK YOU STAFFERS CALL FOR HELPING NINE MY FELLOW. BOB PUTTING BILL TOGETHER AND WORKING IN RECENT TO BE PATIENT WITH HIM. AND HOPEFULLY A LOT IF YOU COULD IN OTHER SINGLE ALL OF THIS MAKES THIS BILL SIXTY. YEAH. MOVE THEIR OPPOSITION BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ARE NOT THE TARGET OF THIS LEGISLATION. DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES ARE TARGETED AND EVERY TIME ARGUES TARGETED ADVERTISING TO PREYON CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH DEBT. THEY PROMISE CONSUMERS THAT THEY WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE DEBT BY NEGOTIATING WITH THE CREDITORS AND STOPPING COLLECTION ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATING WITH CREDITORS SOME COMPANIES SIMPLY TAKE THE MONEY WHEN THE CONSUMERS COMPLAIN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANY DISAPPEARS OUR CLAIMS THAT NO MONEY IS LEFT DUE TO THEIR FEES. BEHIND THESE FLY BY NIGHT COMPANIES ARE PRO RAIDERS WHO COLLECT THE MONEY FROM CONSUMERS TO PAY CREDITORS BUT IN MANY CASES FIND PRETEXT TO KEEP IT. THIS POLICY SERVES ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT WILL HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. FAMILIES OF COLORED NON ENGLISH SPEAKING FAMILIES SENIORS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME. CONSUMERS ONE ROLE IN DEBT SETTLEMENT A SERVICES DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE CREDIT REPORT. THAT THEY CAN STILL AND IN MANY CASES BE SOON FOR AN ENROLLED- DEBT. AND SIX AND THAT SUCCESSFUL DEBT SETTLEMENT SERVICES REQUIRE AN AVERAGE OF FOUR YEARS OF PARTICIPATION BEFORE MOST OF THE IN ROLE DEBT WILL BE SETTLED. WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF AMERICANS FACING AN EMPLOYMENT AS A RESULT OF COAL BUT NINETEEN. WE ANTICIPATE A LARGE RISE IN CONSUMER DEBT- ESPECIALLY AS MANY CALIFORNIANS ALREADY LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. DURING THIS TIME THE NEED TO HAUL DECEPTION IN DEBT SETTLEMENT IS HEIGHTENED. THE NORTH CAROLINA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS ISSUED A WARNING THAT UNSCRUPULOUS DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES WILL PREY ON UNEMPLOYED AND FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING CONSUMERS. IN FACT EVEN GOOGLE HAS RECOGNIZED THE HARM CAUSED BY MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE BUT ADVERTISEMENT. FROM DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES AND HAS IMPLEMENTED A POLICY OF RESTRICTING ADS FROM UNREGULATED DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR INJURES CONSUMERS TO RECOVER THE MONEY TAKEN FROM THEM. BY PREDATORY ENTITIES. THIS BILL WILL HOLD THE PAYMENT PROCESSING COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MISLEADING PRACTICES. BY EXPLICITLY STIPULATING IN LAW THAT PRO RATE IS ARE INCLUDED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FORTY THREE SPECIFIED THAT CALIFORNIA'S DEBT SETTLEMENT LAW DOES APPLY. TO ATTORNEYS AND LAW FIRMS. THIS BILL IS STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT REQUIRED DISCLOSURES OF GIVEN- TO GIVE CONSUMERS FAIR PRACTICE. FOR NOTICE ABOUT WHETHER A DEBT SETTLEMENT PLAN IS RIGHT IS THE RIGHT OPTION FOR THEM. AND PROHIBIT FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF DEBT SETTLEMENT ON A CONSUMER DEBT. UGH TO TESTIFY TODAY WITH ME ON PHONE IS DANIELLE CANDLE KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND CLEAR JOHNSON ROLE HAAS FROM UC IRVINE'S CONSUMER LAW CLINIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S NOW TURN TO THE WITNESSES SO AS MISSION. MS KAISER OR MISS YES GET OUT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL COUNTER BECAUSE YOU'RE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION WE ARE THE FUNCTIONS AND EIGHTY TWO FOUR FOUR THREE. AGAIN CLICK OF A COALITION OF MORE THAN A DOZEN LEGALLY PROVIDERS FROM AROUND THE STATE TO COLLECTIVELY THIRTY THOUSAND LOW INCOME CONSUMERS EVERY YEAR AND IT'S MEMBERS WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA LAW. WE APPLAUD DR WEBBER'S AUTHORSHIP OF AB TWO FOUR FOUR THREE IN THE PROTECTIONS THAT WOULD PROVIDE CONSUMERS. WE ALSO THANK THE BANKERS AND THE CREDIT UNION FOR THE TIME THEY'VE TAKEN TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL LANGUAGE. A DOCTOR WEBER HAS STATED THE GOAL OF AB TWO FOUR FOUR THREE IS TO AMEND THE LRA TO CLEARLY DEFINE HOW DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANY SHOULD OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA.

I'M DOCTOR WEBER HAS STATED WHILE GOOGLE HAS RESTRICTED THAT PUBLIC COMPANIES ADVERTISING WE'RE NOW SEEING THE ARRIVAL. OF THE CODE NINETEEN RELATED ACADEMIC ECONOMIC RECESSION AND AN INCREASE IN RADIO TV AND SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISEMENTS BY UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS. HILL STRAIGHT TALK TO WEBBER'S POINT. A FREQUENT FALSE STATEMENT IN THEIR EYES IS QUOTE HEY NOTHING AND CLEARED THAT IT STARTLED. THAT PARLIAMENT COMPANIES DO CHARGE UP FRONT FEES OR THE SUBTLE ONE SMALL THAT AND THEN BEGIN TO TAKE ALL OF THEIR FEES. THEY OFFERED TO STOP THE DEBT COLLECTORS FROM CALLING BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE CLEAR THAT THEY ENCOURAGE THE CUSTOMER TO STOP PAYING ALL THAT. INDIRECT ALL COMMUNICATION FROM THE CREDITOR TO THE DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANY. THIS BUSINESS MODEL LEAVES THE CONSUMER THINKING THAT IT IT IS. EVERYTHING FINE WELL IT WRECKS THE CONSUMER'S CREDIT. AND ARE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE REALLY CREDIBLE FILED A LAWSUIT TO COLLECT. INITIALLY THE COMPANY STRONGLY DISCOURAGE CUSTOMERS FROM SEEKING REMEDIES SO OFTEN WORKS VERY WELL. SUCH A DEBT CONSOLIDATION AND THE NEGOTIATING DOWN OF THE CONSUMERS CURRENT THAT. THEY'RE OUT CALL THESE FORMS OF DEBT MANAGEMENT QUOTE CUMBERSOME AND UNDESIRABLE. IN CLOSING WITH THE RECESSION WE NOW FACE IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO PROVIDE CLEAR AND COMPLETE PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR FINANCES.

TO BE CONSIDERED A VERIFIED CREDENTIALS DURINGTHE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS CRISIS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL TOOLS OUR STATE HAS AGAINST THE VIRUSES ARE YOU TO TEST FOR THE DISEASE. AND PERFORM CONTACT TRACING TO UNDERSTAND IT SPREAD. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS IDENTIFIED TESTING AND CONTACT FACING IS ONE OF THE SIX CORE INDICATORS. BOTTOM FIGHT THE URGENT PERSON A STATEWIDE ENGAGEMENT IN TESTING AND TRACKING COMMUNITIES ARE BEGINNING TO- ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY HESITANT TO ENGAGE WITH THESE EFFORTS BECAUSE OF PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH HOW THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH DATA WILL BE USED VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS OFFER A PRIVATE AND SECURE WAY TO PROVE AN INDIVIDUAL SCOLDED NINETEEN TEST RESULTS WITHOUT SACRIFICING THEIR PRIVACY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW ISSUERS OF COVERT NINETEEN OF THE COVERT NINETEEN TEST TO UTILIZE VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS YEAH IMPLEMENTING A MINIMUM STANDARD IT WOULD ENSURE THAT SUCH CREDENTIALS ARE TRULY PROTECT AND CALIFORNIA IS RIGHT TO PROP. ALLOWING THEM TO TEST THE CRUCIAL EFFORT TO CAN. VIRUS AND ULTIMATELY REOPEN OUR STATE. WITH ME TO TEST A FIVE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME- THIS SO IF THE WITNESSES ARE ON THE LINE YOU MAY BEGIN AS WELL. BUT WHAT THIS IS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR RAJ BUT- AND I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ANESTHESIOLOGY AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALLED RUNS BILL TWO ZERO AB TWO YEARS OR FOUR. THE CROWN OF OUR SPEND AND FOR SOCIETY INTO A PLACE THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN BEFORE AND WE WILL NEED NEW TOOLS TO RETURN SOCIETY TO A FUNCTIONING LEVEL. WHILE STILL MAXIMIZING SAFETY PRIVACY AND TRUST IN OUR SYSTEM. IN OUR PRIOR WORLD IF SOMEONE NEEDED TO PROVIDE A VERIFIED. MEDICAL TESTS TO AN EMPLOYER OR SCHOOL THEY WOULD REQUEST THE DOCUMENTS FROM THEIR DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR HEALTH SYSTEM. THEN TAKE THE PAPER OR ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT TO THE PERSON WHO NEEDED IT. AND THAT THEIR SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE THEM VERIFY EVERYTHING BEFORE COMPLETION. FOR EXAMPLE GETTING VACCINATION RECORDS TO YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL BEFORE THE NEW YEAR BEGAN. THIS COULD TAKE DAYS AT BEST AND OFTEN WEEKS TO COMPLETE. HOWEVER THIS- IS UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE THESE INTERACTIONS THAT THIS WAS ACCEPTABLE BEFORE BECAUSE THESE INTERACTIONS WERE REPRESENTS MOST OF US. IN THE KNOW THAT THE TABLE ROOM. HELLO IN TODAY'S WORLD WOULD BE CANNIBAL TO YOU EXISTING PROCESS EVERY TWO OF COURSE MIGHT NAY. THE PERSON THEIR TESTING IN FOR POKER OF TO THEIR EMPLOYER GOV BUILDING A SCHOOL A HOSPITAL SALON A GROCERY STORE A CONCERT VENUE THE STADIUM OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF PLACES THAT HUMANS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. THIS WOULD BE MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF TIMES A WEEK. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSMITTING AND STORING THIS IMPORTANT HEALTH DATA IT'S SIMPLY NOT SET UP TO OPERATE AT THIS SCALE SUFFICIENTLY. IN A VERIFIABLE CREDENTIAL SYSTEM THE PERSON ISSUING THE CREDENTIAL NEEDS TO BE A TRUSTED ENTITY FOR EXAMPLE A DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR A NURSE PRACTITIONER. AND WE ALREADY HAVE PROCESSES FOR IDENTIFYING THESE PEOPLE INVALIDATING THAN. THIS ISSUE OR IS GIVING THE CREDENTIALS OF THE PERSON THEMSELVES TO HOLD THIS GIVES THE INDIVIDUAL TO CONTROL THEIR OWN PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION AND- NOW THAT PERSON HAS THE ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE THAT INFORMATION. AND WEBER NEED THAT IN A TRUSTED AND SECURE WAY WITHOUT HAVING RETURNED ISSUING ENTITIES THE TIME. ALSO WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE THE RECIPIENT TAKE TIME AND WORK TO CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE TEST EVERY TIME. THEY WOULD ALL BE AUTOMATED. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TEST OR CATS WILL BE THE MAGIC FORMULA TO KEEP US SAFE FROM INFECTION OR FROM INFECTING OTHERS. VIRAL TESTING ANTIBODY TESTING VACCINES OR COMBINATION. THAT INFORMATION IS EVOLVING RAPIDLY HOWEVER WE CAN GO AHEAD AND CREATE A TRUSTED INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM THAT IS EFFICIENT SECURE. AND ADAPTABLE TO THIS EVOLVING INFORMATION. THAT WAY GOVERNMENT BODIES PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE THE DECISION. THAT WE NEED BASED ON THE TESTING FOR SOCIETY AND THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE WAY TO CONVEY THAT INFORMATION. TO EVERYONE WHO NEEDS IT. AB TWO ZERO ZERO FOR AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN ALLOWING THE UTILIZATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE ON. THE TEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS.

ITSELF IS ACTUALLY CAN YOU THREE OVER THE ECONOMY AND LUNCH DURING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PRIVACY FOR AND. WITH YOU MAY. YEAH VERY ALLOW THE USE OF THEIR CREDENTIAL THE NEW TO CREATE MAINTAIN NINETEEN OR OTHER. ALL A CLEAR FIVE THIS AND- BECAUSE FULL RIGHT MINIMUM STANDARDS DO YEAH.

IF WE NEED TO PRE THAT THEY A CO NINETEEN CARPET WHATEVER IT TAKES. UNDECLARED WITH THE FAN. THEY COULD TAKE PATH. TO THEIR DOCTOR AND HAVE THE DOCTOR VERIFIED WITH ALL. AT PROBABLY THE FOR A Q. R. CODE. WHATEVER THEY WANT TO SHARE OR CONFIRM THEIR CAPTORS. STATUS IF THEY MIGHT GO BACK TO WORK AND YOU TO TRANSFER THE WORKPLACE. THEY CAN SHARE THE INFORMATION THEY WANT. WE NEED TO GET BENEFITS. MAKING SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THEY WANT INTEREST ALONG. FOR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THAT. CASE BLOCKING DOES NOT FOR MEDI DATA REALLY NEED TO CONVENE INFORMATION FRAUD PERMISSION IF YOU'RE LIKE A DOCTOR OR NURSE PRACTITIONER TO A PATIENT WE'RE NOT DICTATING WITH CAPTAIN KIRK ARE STANDARD COULD BE BACK ALL RELIANT ON WHATEVER OUR HEALTH AGENCIES NOT WHAT IF YOU COULD SECURE WAY OF CONVEYING INFORMATION AND EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE THEIR OWN DATA NOT HAVING TO HEAR ABOUT ALL HOPE IT WOULD.

BY THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM. IT'S UNCLEAR TO US TYPICALLY JUST. IS TO EXPLICITLY ALLOW FOR THE USE OF VERIFIED CREDENTIALS. THEREFORE IF THE LEGISLATURE TO DISREGARD LIST YOU CREATE BACK TO IN THE AREA IF YOU TAKE GREAT CARE NOT TO CREATE PROBLEMATICALLY PULLED THAT MAY HARM CONSUMERS. CAN'T FOR INNOVATION OR DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT CERTAIN BUSINESS MODEL OVER OTHERS. I'VE WRITTEN THE BILL LANGUAGE IT'S UNCLEAR AS TO WITHOUT WHICH PRIVATE OR PUBLIC ENTITIES WOULD BE COVERED AND IN WHICH THE CONTENT THAT. AND OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN AFTER FORGET IN THE LATE AT THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT. I KNOW LIMITING THE SHARING TESTABLE PRION FOR QUITE A RING THAT SOMEONE TRYING TO ACCESS TEST RESULTS VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS. THE BILL CURRENTLY ALLOWED ANYONE WITH A VERIFIABLE CREDENTIAL TO GET ANYONE ELSE TO TEST RESULT. WHAT THE BILL FACT SHEET THE DRAFT THAT IT MIGHT THE PHILIPPINE AUTOMATED CONTRACT FREE THING WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT TO BE CORRECT AS WRITTEN. THE AUTOMATED CONTACT THREE THING IN THE LAST AT LEAST THAT THAT IT'S ALREADY BEEN FOUGHT FOR AND THE APPLE GOOGLE API FACT. IS THAT PROXIMITY OP USERS WILL REPORT NO INFORMATION FROM THEIR PHONE TWO ESSENTIAL TO THE TENT EXCEPT IF THEY ARE CONFIRMED I'VE INTERACTED WITH COALBED. BUT PROXIMITY IDENTIFIERS THAT THEIR PHONE USE THAT WILL THEN TRANSMIT THAT DATA TO OTHERS. EVEN IF THE BILL MAKES SOME PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SHARING THEIR TEST RESULTS. BUT SHOULD HAVE NO BEARING WHATSOEVER ON THEIR COMFORT WHEN IT COMES TO DOWNLOADING THINGS LIKE PROXIMITY APPS. WHICH ARE ALSO NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED UNDER LAW TO LIMIT THE SCOPE AND USE A DATA THAT THEY COLLECT. MOREOVER IF MEASURE WILL HAVE LITTLE RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER TO TESTING WERE UNABLE TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR TAX IN THE FIRST PLACE. FINALLY I'VE WRITTEN THE MEASURE SPECIFIED A SINGULAR WAY BY AT THE W.

FOR INSTANCE I FEEL THAT THE USE OF SCARAB BIBLE CLEANS FOR COMMUNITY CREDENTIALS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RISK ANALYSIS. LIKE THE- STAFF I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE- THE USE OF CREDENTIALS FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH- PERSPECTIVE- BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. I DO BELIEVE THAT IF THE STATE ASSEMBLY IS GOING TO OPERATE SOME FORM OF INVESTIGATION PROOF OF CONCEPT OR IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PRIVACY PRESERVING HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT VERIFIABLE CLAIMS IN THE CENTRAL LIKE IDENTIFIERS ARE THE STATUS ARCHITECTURE AVAILABLE TODAY. ALL RIGHT OF COURSE IMPLEMENTED STILL NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE DETAILS IT IS STILL POSSIBLE USE THESE. REYES COMPROMISE THEIR INTENDED GOALS FOR SECURITY AND PRIVACY.

WHICH HARM THE PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PERSIST. AS NOTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE COMMITEE ANALYSIS I AM HAPPY TO BE TAKING AMENDMENT TO SUGGESTED. THAT IMPROVES THE BILL'S REFERENCE TO CAL. I'M PLEASE JOIN HERE TODAY BY PHONE WITH THE ROBERT CALLAGHAN FROM THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION AND MAP THE CORBIN FROM. ELECTRONIC FUN DOWN HERE. THANK GO TO A WITNESSES MISTER CALLAHAN ON THE LINE. I AM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ROBERT CALLAGHAN WITH HERE THIS ISSUE SHE HAD NOT A PROUD TO BE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE ONE ONE SIX. THE BILL THAT WOULD SIMPLY CLARIFY THAT Q. LOCATION AND YOUR LOCATION RELATED DATA GENERATED FROM THE OPERATION OF MOBILITY DEVICES IS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SUBJECT TO EXISTING PROTECTIONS AND STATE LAW- NAY PLACES OF A WOMAN MENTIONED ARE OPENING- CALIFORNIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT AS WELL AS THE- RECENTLY ENACTED CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. AS WAS DISCUSSED IN GREAT DEPTH IN A SENATE PROMOTIONAL HEARING- JUST THIS PAST FEBRUARY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS NOW STATED REPEATEDLY THAT THE HELD DURING OF REAL TIME. SHE LOCATION THE GOVERNMENT COVER CAL TECH. FOR WHATEVER REPORTER BROTHER PROCESS AB MINUTES WE ALSO HEARD HEARING- INCREASING IMPORT PUBLIC IRAN'S ISSUE THERE TO NOT TO BE A- YOU CASE FOR THE- NON AGGREGATED TRIP DATA SHOWS THE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS IN NEAR REAL TIME OUTSIDE OF AN URGENT LAW ENFORCEMENT MATTER. THE REAL TIME MONITORING OF MOBILITY DEVICE TRIP DATA EVEN IF INTENDED FOR LEGITIMATE USE SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PURPOSE. ADDS TO A REAL THREAT OF GROWING GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE ON THE MOVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS. NOW AGAIN WE'RE NOT ARGUING- THROUGH THIS BILL THE PUBLIC AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE IMPORTANT USES FOR MOBILITY DATA BECAUSE THEY CERTAINLY DO YOU. AB THREE ONE SIX IS MY COMPROMISED PROTECTION AND FROM THERE ON WHAT ALSO ENSURING PUBLIC IT HE'S SAYS. THERE ARE DATED AND ANONYMIZE MOBILITY DATA WHICH SHOWS THE TRAPPINGS AND INSIGHTS NEEDED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING YEAH THAT. USES FOR DEBT THE BILL TO COME. BUT NONE OF WHICH- WILL TRIP DAY AND IN EVERY WOULD BETTER SERVED WITH TARGETED AGGREGATED DATA WE AGREED THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS WANTED STATES DEPLETED DOES NOT NEED TO BE TIED TO AN INDIVIDUAL OR VERGE TRIP. IN ORDER IS FOR THE CITY'S INDEED AGGREGATED ANONYMOUS DATA CAN PROVIDE INSIGHT TO THE TRAVEL PATTERNS CONGESTION AND USE GET THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE MADE. LOCATION DATA IS DEEPLY PERSONAL PERSONAL AND AMONG MOST PRIVACY SENSITIVE FORMS DATA THAT MERITS. CASE PROVIDED IS STILL. LIKELY ASK COMMITTEE FOR I ON AB THREE ONE ONCE THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT. DIRECTOR CHAIR MEMBERS MET THE CORPORATE ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION I WOULD BE AMENDMENT TAKEN TODAY AND COMMITTEE AT THE Q. IN SUPPORT OF THREE ONE ONE SIX WHICH AS AMENDED WILL STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY. AND THE NEED FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO OBTAIN THE DATA THAT THEY NEED FOR CITY PLANNING PUBLIC THAT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHORS FOR DRESSING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND FOR THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME THEY SPENT DISCUSSING IT WITH US. LOW AND REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE INCREASINGLY DEMANDING ACCESS TO NEW MOBILITY START AT THAT AND DEVICES IN ORDER TO BETTER PLAN. AND ENSURE THAT THE STREETS WORK FOR ALL. THE ABOUT THE GRIEF THAT PLANNING AGENCY SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT SOME DATA IN ORDER TO NSURE NEW TRANSPORTATION DEBATE THAT ARE DEEPLY DEEPLY. PATIENTLY EQUITABLY AND SUSTAINABLY. BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE TO COLLECT. PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT WRITERS IN ORDER TO DO SO. SO TWO THINGS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. INDIVIDUAL TRIP DATA IS SENSITIVE LOCATION DATA THAT PERTAIN TO MOVEMENT OF REAL INDIVIDUAL AS SUCH SHE ALWAYS BE OFF LIMITS FOR CITY OR REGIONAL PLANNING PURPOSES. LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN AND SHOULD WE USE AGGREGATED AND DE IDENTIFIED TRICKY THAT TO IT THEY'RE PLANNING CALL. MEASURE TAKE A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD TO PROTECTING THE LOCATION PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE STATE WHO RELY ON SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. IT APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZED THAT THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL TRIP DATA AND ENSURE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL RECEIVE ONLY AGGREGATED NON IDENTIFIABLE TRIP DATA. WE'VE PROTECTION FOR CRITICAL BECAUSE EVEN WITH NAME STRIPPED OUT LOCATION INFORMATION NOTORIOUSLY EASY TO LIKE THREE I GOT. PARTICULARLY FOR HER IF YOU OFFER. ESPECIALLY TRUE ONE LOCAL FOR ME I. OVER TO. I TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ON MOBILE DATA. HUMAN ABILITY TRADERS ARE HIGHLY UNIQUE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ONLY FOR THE POINT WHERE ENOUGH TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY 95% OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN THE STUDY. FINALLY UPDATED AND QUITE IMPORTANTLY EIGHTY THREE ONE ONE PERFECT CLARIFY HOW ACT APPLIES TO INDIVIDUAL TRIP DATA THAT HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. ON ITS FACE THE LAW ALREADY CLEARLY APPLIES TO TRIP DATA GENERATED BY SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES HOWEVER CLARIFICATION IS NONETHELESS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MULTIPLE CALIFORNIA FIT HAVE TAKEN THE NOVEL PUT ON THAT THE FIGHT HELLO BUT CLEAN MY- DEFINITION. DOCU HOW DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM. AB THREE ONE SIX AND THE CLEAR SIGNAL TO THIRTY THE OFFICE. ONE OF. PRIVATE AND THEY'VE NEVER BUT THE KITCHEN THAT THE ALL INTENDED HOW LEX BUT APPLY INDIVIDUALTRIP JENNA BY BUT DEVICE AND A COOK BY OF THAT TWO THOUSAND MEASURE WE HOPE HARD AGREE AS YOU MIGHT THINK YOU. THANK YOU. OUR SHOULD NO SIMPLE. IN PERSON I DON'T SEE ANY LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES. ANYBODY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE SO. IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND IN THE ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS YOUR POSITION.

NOW FOR NOW FOR THE LINE CAN KILL A COMMA THANK YOU VERY MUC LET'S NOW GO TO OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS ON THE LINE- MISS ALL RIGHT SOUNDS FROM THE LA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS- MISTER CLOSE ART FROM THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA. ARE YOU ON THE LINE SO. YES SO IT AROUND CAN YOU HEAR ME YES AGO HAD HIS RENTALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HONORABLE LEGISLATORS AS GENERAL MANAGER OF THE STATE'S LARGEST CITY TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT MY FOCUS LIKE YOURS. HAS BEEN ON MEETING CRITICAL NEED- DURING THIS TIME- MY EMPLOYEES ARE TRANSIT DRIVERS AND- TRAFFIC OFFICERS AND THEY ARE ON THE FRONT LINES AND THEY ARE SOFT IT AND RIGHT. MIGHT HERE WITH YOU TO GET AWAY FROM OUR CRISIS WORK AND THE MEASURE HOW SERIOUSLY I TAKE THIS BILL AND HAVE SERIOUSLY WOULD AFFECT CALIFORNIA CITY. IT WOULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND MANAGE THE STREETS AND SIDEWALKS AND PROMOTE SAFETY ACCESSIBILITY IN EQUITY AS PRIVATE AND FOR PROFIT VEHICLE OPERATE ON OUR STREETS AND SIDEWALKS. TODAY AND INCREASINGLY IN THE FUTURE ACCESS TO RELIABLE ACCURATE AND TIMELY DATA IS ESSENTIAL TO THIS WORK. IT'S ONLY THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT CITIES HAVE GAINED INSIGHT INTO OUT OF IT FOR THAT VEHICLE. USE OUR PUBLIC STREET. FOR ARE WE RELIED ON AGGREGATED. THAT TURNED OUT TO BE GROWTH MANIPULATED BY COMPANIES. THE RESULT WAS INCREASING TRAFFIC AND KERR CONGESTION ELEVATED CO TWO EMISSIONS. GROWING PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS REDUCE TRANSIT YOUTH AND THE MISTREATMENT OF WORKERS THAT REQUIRED THIS BOBBY TO PASS. THE FIVE. THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WERE PROMISED. THIS BILL FORTY TWO AGAIN REAL COMPANIES AGGREGATED DATA TO PROTECT BOOK AND- SIMPLY WON'T WORK RELY AND TIMELY IT WILL BE EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL AT EVERYTHING HE GRAPPLES WITH THE EFFECT OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND HOW THEY WILL SHAPE THE TRANSPORTATION LANDSCAPE IMAGE WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC DISRUPTION AND LAST X. PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT DATA USE AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE COLLECT AND PROTECT FROM DISCLOSURE ONLY BASIC DATA ABOUT THE FOR PROFIT COME. VEHICLE OPERATING AND THE PLAY WE NOT COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WRITERS. IN FACT UBER AND JUMP INFORMED ITS RIDERS ON ITS OWN APT QUOTE. OF THE DAY WE CITIES COLLECTED FROM YOUR PERSONAL NOT DIVIDE. OR IF I YOU AFTER THOUSAND CONSIDERS WERE DROPPED ON OUR STREETS WE WANT TO PILOT THAT BECAME THE LARGE IN THE NAY PROVIDING NO LIVES FOR INJURY BEFORE THAT AND THEN THE CAT TO MANAGE THESE ALMOST FORTY THOUSAND VEHICLES AFFECT. WHY OR UNLOCKED THE COPY. US AND THAT SANDERS LOCATION. THIS SIMPLE REQUIREMENT US TO VERIFY DATA INTEGRITY BY. THEN A DAY AFTER THE SCOOTER IS USED THE COMPANY SENT THE CITY TRIP DATA NOT IN REAL TIME WE DON'T COLLECT NAMES ADDRESSES CREDIT INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. EVEN THOUGH THE DATA RECEIVED BASIC WE KEEP IT HIGHLY SECURE ENCRYPTED IF SOMEBODY WERE ABLE TO LEGALLY ACCESS ARE BROUGHT INCREASE DATA. HACK OTHER SOURCES INCLUDING OUTSIDE CITY OF LA DATABASES TO COBBLE TOGETHER AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY. AND FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE CITIES WITH MISUSED DATA AFTER WHO SHOULD STOP COLLECTING PARKING TICKET REVENUES OF PROCESSING PERMIT. FOR KERR DESIGNATIONS AND SPEED HOW. PROPERTIES THAT WE MUCH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND ASK FROM ABILITY COMPANIES TODAY. THE DATA WE COLLECTED NOT A TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IT WOULD ONLY BE ACCESSIBLE WITH A SUBPOENA OR WARRANT THE DATA WE HAVE A VALUE TO ONE FORCED THE COMPANY'S EXTENSIVE DATA IS WHAT IS USED CALL NOT OURS. THIS DATA IS NOT AT ALL USEFUL FOR CONTACT TRACING THE WIRES THE FULL TRACK PATTERN THE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL THROUGHOUT THE DAY ACTIVE. ON THE PRODUCT THE CASE STATE THE DOCTOR SAID I RECEIVED FUNDAMENTAL OBSERVING STATUS CHANGES TO THE PUBLIC. YEAH BUT WHAT. BUT THAT HAS NO I DO THEFT INFORMATION AND CAN ONLY IN PUBLIC HEALTH THE OFFICIALS SHORT TRIP. THAT DIVIDE X. MADE AT LEAST TWENTY HOURS A- THAT'S WHY COUNTRIES THAT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT TRACING HIS COMMUNICATION DEVICE DATA FROM MOBILE PHONES NOT RENTED SCOOTER DATA. MARK FOUNDER PERSONALLY OWNED IDENTITY SPECIFIC KERRIGAN POCKET TO PURSUE THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE ARGUMENT USED BY HEARING ITEM ARE BASED ON A- AND- BY. SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERRED POLICY. FOR CONSIDERATION BY POLICY COMMITTEE THAT DELIBERATE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. THE TIMING OF THE LEGISLATION ALSO UNDERMINE ONGOING WORK BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND MULTIPLE STATE AGENCY. FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT UP WITH DATA FROM TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LAURA FRIEDMAN ABOUT AN A. B. ELEVEN TWELVE. THIS BILL WOULD CODIFY DATA DEFINITIONS THAT ARE STILL BEING DISCUSSED. WHAT'S WORSE IT EXPANDS THEM TO TNC AN AV. FOR BOTH WHICH IS THAT THE P. C. AND BMG. ARE DEVELOPING REGULATIONS. MUCH REMAINS TO BE LEARNED ABOUT AUTOMATED VEHICLES OR DRONES ARE OTHER YET TO BE A GRADUATE. BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE. CON FOR EMPLOYEE IN THIS AND- A THREE ONCE WHAT PLACE REGULATORS ON THE SIDELINES AGAIN. A SPECTATOR TO INNOVATION RATHER THAN PARTICIPANTS AND THAT. IF PASSED THIS BILL WOULD YOUR CITY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY REDUCING THE AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS UNDER YEARS OF DELIBERATION REGULATORY DESIGN. AND PREMATURELY RESTRICT EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF FUTURE MODE. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THEREFORE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THE NEXT SPEAKER IN OPPOSITION. WELL HELLO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS KYLE CODES ARE ON THE SENIOR TRANSPORTATION PLANNER- THE CITY SANTA MONICA AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS THE CITY'S STRONG OPPOSITION TO A. B. THIRTY ONE SIXTEEN AS IT WOULD UNDERMINE OUR EXISTING SHARED MOBILITY PILOT PROGRAM WHICH CURRENTLY BEST SERVES THE INTEREST OF OUR CITY AND ITS RESIDENTS THE DATED ISSUE IN THE BILL IS NOT CLOSER TO THE CITY TO EFFECTIVELY REGULATE THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. CITY NEED TOOLS CAN MEET PUBLIC NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS. IN ITS CRRENT FORM. AB THIRTY ONE SIXTEEN TO SEVERELY LIMIT THESE TOOLS WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS PREMATURE BILL AT THAT SITE AS CITY LIKE ARE THERE STILL ARE PILOT PROGRAM PHASE OF REGULATION AND IS BILLS ALSO INTERCEDE INTERCEDES AND ONGOING DELIBERATIONS ON AB ELEVEN TWELVE BROUGHT TO THE ASSEMBLY BY. NUMBER FRIEDMAN- WHICH IS ANOTHER BILL THE DEALING DIRECTLY WITH THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE ISSUES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AFTER THE REGULAR THE LAUNCH OF SHEM ABILITY TO BUY SANTA MONICA RATHER THAN BANDIT DEVICES LIKE MANY OTHER CITIES HAD DONE. WE MOVE QUICKLY TO CREATE POWERFUL REGULATIONS THAT ENABLE THE USE OF THE VICES WHILE ADJUSTING SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SAFETY ACCEPTABILITY. AND EQUITY CONCERNS OF OUR COMMUNITY. TODAY ALL FOUR OF THE PERMITTED OPERATORS IN SANTA MONICA HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE DATA REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PILOT PROGRAM. THE DATA THAT THE OPERATORS PROVIDE TO THE CITY IS CRITICAL TO OUR FUNCTIONS AS REGULATORS PLANNERS AND MANAGERS OF THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. DATA IS NOT IN REAL TIME AND IT CONTAINS NO CONSUMER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AB THIRTY ONE SIXTEEN WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY REMOVE THE CITY'S ABILITY TO MEANINGFULLY REGULATE CHAIRED MOBILITY OPERATORS BY PROHIBITING THE CITY FROM COLLECTING TRIP DATA IT IS VITAL THAT WE MONITOR AND FORCE AND UNDERSTAND SURE MOBILITY USE WITHIN THE CITY. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE CITY LIKE MONICA EITHER ALLOW THE INDUSTRY TO SELF REGULATE OR BAN OPERATIONS OF THESE TYPES OF SERVICES ALTOGETHER. THIS IS THE CHOICE WE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO MAKE. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THE BY WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SHARED MOBILITY OPERATORS WE CAN DEVELOP PROTOCOLS THAT WE PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY WHILE ENABLING US TO GET THE DATA WE NEED TO EFFECTIVELY REGULATE THE INDUSTRY USE OF THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. AB THIRTY ONE SIX IN UNDER THESE EFFORTS TO DATE AND FOR THAT REASON THE CITY SANTA MONICA IS STRONGLY OPPOSED AB THIRTY ONE SIXTEEN THANK. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY OUR LOOKS THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK- MISTER ONE FOR PRESENTING THE BILL I'M A PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF THE BILL- AND- THE REASON WHY I THINK THIS BILL. I THINK INDIVIDUAL LOCALIZED ANNA AND LOCATION DATA IS REALLY SENSITIVE AND MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS AND I THINK THIS BILL STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE OF- ALLOWING ACCESS TO ANONYMIZE DATA WHILE STILL SAFEGUARDING INSIDE IN A FULL I DON'T IDENTIFY TRIPPED OUT OF SO- LOOK. WORK WHEN FOR THE DON'T HAVE. IS THERE. ARE COMMON GO AHEAD. YEAH YEAH RIGHT THE NUMBER OF THE. THE OTHER AS A ONCE. THERE I WAS A CHAIR. WE WERE. MAC I THANK YOU SO MEMBER OR WENT INTRODUCING THIS BILL- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS- AS WE VOTE ON STATEWIDE LAWS WE FIRST REPRESENTED THE DISTRICTS THAT WE COME FROM AND I REPRESENT LAWCENTER AS THE LARGE SITTING CALIFORNIA WITH ROBUST TRANSPORTATION PLAN IN OUR AN OLD ON THE PHONE FOR HER TESTIMONY I HAVE CONCERNS WITH WELL IN A FORM WHICH PUT CITIES BUT- AND STUFF FOR. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WRITE. A REALLY AS A MATTER OF TRUST AND ALLOWING FOR PROFIT COMPANIES TO AGGREGATE DATA BEFORE PROVIDING IT TO THE REGULATORS PROVIDES IN MY OPINION A CLEARANCE CENTER. ELATION ACRONYM CAN ASSIST UNTIL FOR BOTH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING BECAUSE THESE DECISIONS ARE ONLY A SMART THE DATA THAT THEY RELY ON. DIRECT ACCESS TO DEVICE SPECIFIC INFORMATION EQUIPS REGULATORS WITH THE TOOLS TO MANAGE THE RIGHT WAY. WHY SHOULD WE PREVENT CITIES FROM GETTING A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DATA IT THIS ALLOWS THEM TO VERIFY. THE ACCURACY AND VALIDITY OF THE INFORMATION THE COMPANIES ARE PROVIDING. ADDITIONALLY WHILE I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL AIMS TO GOVERN DATA PRIVACY IT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES STOCK WITH MOBILITY TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND OTHER FUTURE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. IT SEEMS HERE THAT THE IMPACTS OF THIS BILL WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. PETITION APARTMENT ACOSTA ST OF CALIPERS LARGEST CITIES LOS ANGELES SAN JOSE AND I'M FRANCISCO OUT OF THE THESE ARE TOP THREE. OUT OF FIVE. THE ALL IN OPPOSITION I'M NOT SURE I'M CONVINCED THAT THIS BILL QUALIFIES TO BE HEARD THIS SESSION BASED ON THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SET TODAY BUT IF WE INSIST ON MOVING FORWARD I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THIS BILL HEARD IN TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AS WELL FOR THE AND I WILL BE. FROM THIS. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY WOMAN- ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SIDE I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF QUICK STATEMENTS THIS IS- THIS WAS REALLY AN ISSUE OF WHETHER CAL LACK THE OF ALSO A RELATED TO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BEYOND JUST OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND THE THIS IS- NUMEROUS TIMES LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS SAID THAT YES IT'S- BLACK BUT IS A REAL TO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND THERE ARE THREE ONE YOU HAVE THAT IN STATION THE CHIU AND THE FS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND AS MS CORBIN MISTER CALLAHAN IS WICKS SAID THE MOST SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT THERE IS OR AMONG SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT THERE IS YOUR LOCATION DATA FOR THIS IS TO SAY YOU CANNOT TRACK AND IT WELL ON CASE. AS THAT WOULD WITH PATIENT AND NO PAYMENT IN JAIL. YOU TRACK LOCATION DAY ALL THE WAY TO SOMEBODY HOME SO I THINK THIS- WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. AGAIN AND THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION AND AGGREGATE INFORMATION THE ISSUE THAT MS CARILLO BRINGS IT I THINK IS AN ACCURATE ONE. YEAH I MEAN IS A GOOD. TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT IS ACCURATE. BUT BEING. TO PROVIDE. A IN. THAT IS OF THAT IS ABLE TO TRACK INDIVIDUAL- TRIP DATA I THINK IS OF ANTI PRIVACY AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST STATES ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY THERE ARE TWO MORE PEOPLE ON THE PHONE. I DO WE NEED THE- GO GET THEM ON. I OKAY. ALL RIGHT SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION IS IT. I KNOW WOULD BE THAT'S RIGHT FOR. IS THERE ONE ARE YOU IN CONTACT WITH. RIGHT. MAYBE WE- YEAH. HE WAS ABOUT WERE THE- WITH THE U. POP. ALRIGHT ALL. ALL RIGHT I'M TOLD THAT THE- TWO REMAINING SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION ALREADY. NOW I'M TOLD THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SPEAK AFTER ALL. THANK YOU READY TO THAT. WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE A SECOND AND MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. NOW KILEY. AYE KILEY AYE BARRICADE HAND. OKAY HAND I BERMAN. AND I MEDINA- MEDINA I CARILLO. MULLIN GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER HI- WHEN I IRWIN HI OBERNOLTE. SIX NINE SIX NINE. THE BILL IS OUT- I THINK THAT THE ONLY REMAINING BILLS ARE- THE CHAIRS SO- HE IS ASSURED ME TO BE BACK SHORTLY SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEN. WHAT WE DO. THE MANAGEMENT ALL FIVE OF THEM OR YOU KNOW AND SEE OF THE- AND THEN- ACOSTA WITH REGARD. TO A ARE THERE THE JUST BEINGS. MUCH THAT I RIGHT. ALL. OKAY YEAH THE- YEAH YEAH YEAH. THIS IS NOT. I NOTICED COOL. WE HAVE SOMETHING. AND WE'RE I. THAT YEAH. YEAH YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH YEAH WELL OVER A YEAR YEAH. RIGHT OR- YEAH. RIGHT RIGHT OFF OUR. BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT. IT'S STILL. OR IS SCHOOL AND ONE LOOKS DIFFERENT TURNED INTO A WITNESS MICHAEL BUT THERE IS. BUYERS AN EXPONENTIAL RATE FROM ASSISTING SMARTPHONE USERS IN UNLOCKING THEIR PHONES TO ITS USE IN RETAIL STORES CASINOS CONCERTS IN AIRPORTS F. R. T. SERVES THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. F. FORTY ALSO PROVIDES LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH A TOOL TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY AS EVIDENCED BY ITS RECENT USE TO IDENTIFY THIS IS THE KILLER IN NEW ORLEANS CAPITAL BECAUSE THAT MASS SHOOTING WERE DIE. WHAT OTHER EFFORTS TO FIND TRAFFICKING. MOST RECENTLY GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE GLOBE ARE TURNING KNOWLEDGE G. AN EFFORT TO SAVE LIVES ADMITS. THREAT POSED BY COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. FORTY IS NO EXCEPTION. TECH COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE REPORTEDLY IN TALKS WITH THE US GOVERNMENT TO USE THE DATA A GATHERING AND DATA LOOKING TOWARDS TO TRACK VIRUS TRANSMISSION TREATMENTS INCLUDING CLEAR VIEW THE I A CONTROVERSY ALL COMPANY THAT RECENTLY MADE HEADLINES FOR ASSEMBLING A DATABASE OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION. IS COLLECTED THE INTERNET AND MADE IT DATA AVAILABLE FORCE MEN ARE AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE REPORT BY U. S. NEWS HIGHLIGHTS THE USE OF F. R. T. LIKE CLEAR VIEW A AYE TO AND I QUOTE IDENTIFY ANYONE WHO'S BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE INFECTED PERSON. SIMILAR TO HOW TECH COMPANIES RESPONDED IN THE U. S. AFTER NINE ELEVEN WITH THE PASSING THE PATRIOTIC ACT PAVING WAY TO MASS SURVEILLANCE. AS WE HIT BUT AS WE SIT HERE TODAY DO WE WANT TO SIT IDLY BY AND LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. WITHOUT DEMANDING A TRADE CURRENCY ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. LET'S THINK ABOUT IT. AN OTHER EXAMPLE HOW BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGY IS IN EVOLVING DURING THIS COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IS ITS USE AS A SCREENING SYSTEM. IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT A SECURITY COMPANY WHOSE TECHNOLOGY TO TEXT GUNS IS NOW OFFERING A SCREEN SYSTEM EQUIPPED WITH THERMAL CAMERAS. TO DETECT FEVERS AND ALERT SURROUNDING CUSTOMERS OF SOMEONE POTENTIALLY CARRYING CORONA VIRUS. A PRODUCT IT IS PITCHING TO GROW RESTORE HOSPITALS VOTING LOCATIONS IN DEPLOYING AT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AIRPORTS AND ALSO FOUGHT OF FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES. WHICH DEFINITELY FOR SEAT IS BECOMING A AN ALTERNATIVE TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT RELY ON TOUCH BISTRO SENSORS. WHAT THIS SAYS TO ME IS THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY IN USE AND CONTINUOUSLY DEPLOYED. THEY'RE ALSO CREDITED KERR- CREDIBLE CONCERNS REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF A FAR T. SYSTEMS ON SOME RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUPS AND SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE UNCOVERED BIASES IN FACE RECOGNITION ALGORITHM. IN IN FACT THAT WAS ONE OF THE TWENTY SIX LEGISLATORS SO MISS IDENTIFY A BY A. F. R. T. SYSTEM WITH A MUG SHOT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ACT IS THAT WHILE I FOUR T. OFF SOME BENEFITS TO SOCIETY ITS USE ALSO COMES WITH SERIOUS CHALLENGES THAT MERIT OUR SCRUTINY. BECAUSE OF THESE CONCERNS THE LEGISLATURE MUST REGULATE THE COMPLETE USE OF F. R. T. TO MINIMIZE AND YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE CONSISTS. IS CANCER AND- COMMUNITY. WE RECENTLY HAD A HEARING IN CALIFORNIA ON THE TOPIC AT THE REQUEST OF SOME OF THE GROUPS IN OPPOSITION- AND IT HERE TEN OTHER STATES HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REGULATE BAND OR STUDY FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY A WASHINGTON STATE BECAME THE FIRST STATE NATION TO REGULATE COMPREHENSIVE. R. T. BY IN AGENCIES. TIME HAS COME FOR CALIFORNIA TO ESTABLISH A ROBUST FRT LAW THAT APPLIES EQUALLY ACROSS THE BOARD IN ITS USE BY BUSINESSES AS WELL AS- PUBLIC ENTITIES AND STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ITS APPLICATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY ONE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY THEY OUGHT TO ESTABLISH LIMITS ON THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. BY COMMERCIAL STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS RELATING TO COLLECTION AND THE USE OF THEIR IMAGE OR FACIAL COMPLETES. A CIVIC LEADER. INDEPENDENT TEST OF THOSE FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICES FOR ACCURACY AND UNFAIR PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES ACROSS SUBPOPULATIONS OR MEETING THE RELEVANT FACIAL RECOGNITION VENDOR TELL US THAT% THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY PERFORMS. AND THAT IS THE NEXT STANDARD THOUGH WHICH IS. WHAT PEOPLE CALL THE GOLD STANDARD. IT WOULD REQUIRE ALSO A CONSPICUOUS IN CONTEXTUAL E. APPROACH NOTICE WHEN DEPLOYING FACIAL RECOGNITION SIR IN THE PHYSICS. OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THAT INCLUDE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS AND CONSENT FROM THE INDIVIDUAL BEFORE ENROLLING THEIR MH OR FACIAL TEMPLATE WOULD LIMITED EXCEPT- EXCEPTIONS FOR SCRUTINY OR SAFETY PURPOSE. I TO THAT SERIOUS CRIMINAL OFFENSE AND REQUIRING PROPER BECAUSE AS WELL. IT ALSO PROHIBITS DENYING ACCESS OR SERVICE ON THE BASIS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HOUSE EXERCISED THEIR RIGHT. TO WITHHOLD CONSENT UNLESS IT IS DIRECTLY NECESSARY FOR THE PROVISION OF THE SERVICE. IT ALSO REQUIRES A PROSSER SIR. OR TO DISCRIMINATE UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE LAW AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. IT ALSO REQUIRES MEANINGFUL HUMAN REVIEW WHEN USING A FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT PRODUCED LEGAL AFFECTS. OR SIMILARLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS CONCERNING INDIVIDUALS WHICH INCLUDE DENIAL OF CONSEQUENTIAL SERVICES OR SUPPORTS SUCH AS FINANCIAL AND LENDING SERVICES HOUSING. INSURANCE EDUCATION ENROLLMENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ACCESS TO BASIC NECESSITIES OR THAT IMPACTS CIVIL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IN FACT UNDER THE NEW DEFINITION THE TRAIN INDIVIDUALS DOING THE OVERSIGHT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DECISIONS. BASED IN WHOLE OR IN PART ON THE OUTPUT OF THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICE IT ALSO GRANTS RIGHT TO INDIVIDUALS TO FALL AS- ONE TO CONFIRM WHETHER. THEY'RE MH OFFICIAL TEMPLATE HUSBAND AND ROLE IN THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICE. TO CORRECT OR CHALLENGING DECISION TO ENROLL THEIR IN IMAGE OR FACIAL TEMPLATE OR SECURITY OR SAFETY PURPOSE THREE TO HAVE THEIR IN ROLLED IMAGE OF FACIAL TEMPLATE THE LEADER. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS AND FOR TO WITHDRAW CONSENT TO ENROLL THEIR IMAGE OR FACIAL TEMPLATE IN OFFICIAL RECOGNITION SERVICE. I FINALLY THIS BILL IMPOSES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON AGENCIES DEFINED A STATE OR LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES WHICH USE OR INTENT TO DO BOB PROCURE OR USE FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD REQUIRE AS AN AGE TO PRODUCE. AND ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT REGARDING THE USE OF DOT SYSTEM AND ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT REPORT TO THE PUBLIC AT LEAST NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO EMPLOYING THE SERVICE WHILE ALLOWING FOR A REVIEW AND COMMENT. FOR ANALYZING AND THE RIVER. SO PERHAPS PROHIBITS THE AGING FROM USING AN AGENCY FROM YOU CHAU RECOGNITION SERVICE IN QUE IN ON TO VETERANS UNLESS. CERTAIN STRINGENT REQUIRE AND- ARE MET RELATING TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION OF A SERIOUS CRIMINAL OFFENSE AS DEFINED IN LAW. OR FROM GENERALLY APPLYING OFFICIAL RECOGNITION SERVICE TO AN INDIVIDUAL BASED ON THEIR RELIGIOUS POLITICAL VIEW OR ACTIVITIES BUT THIS PATIENT IN A LAWFUL EVENT OR OTHER PERCEIVED RACE ETHNICITY CITIZENSHIP PLACE OF ORIGIN AGE DISABILITY GENDER. IDENTITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS PROTECTED BY LAW INCLUDING TO CREATE A RECORD OF AN INDIVIDUAL EXERCISING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT. ALTHOUGH BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE DOES THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR TO CONDUCT BY ANNUALLY AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES DEPLOYING FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICES. TO EVALUATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS- TITLE AND FINALLY VIOLATIONS OF THIS- BILL WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES OF NO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER FOR EACH VIOLATION WERE MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR EACH INTENTIONAL VIOLATION OF RECOVER ONLY IN AN ACTION BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS SPECIFIED. IN CLOSING US OFFICIAL RECOGNITION SERVICES INCREASING USED BY BUSINESSES AND PUBLIC ENTITIES WE MUST ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DOING SO WITH TRANSPARENT AND ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. WOULD DOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND- THANK YOU OUT WE HAVE A SPEAKER IN SUPPORT ON THE LINE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS ARION HARKINS I AM THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY WITH MICROSOFT. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY ONE. BUT IT WOULD IMPOSE MUCH NEEDED REGULATION ON BOTH THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. WE'VE SEEN. RAPID ADVANCES IN WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT IN YOU THE BEST A RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ALL AROUND US- IN ACROSS SOCIETY OVER THE PAST DECADE. IN THE TECHNOLOGY IS PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF BENEFITS ACROSS SOCIETY. BUT IT'S ALSO LARGELY UNREGULATED TODAY. THERE ARE IN EFFECT BUT FEW IF ANY RULES IN PLACE. GOVERNING IT DEVELOPMENT IN YOU AND IT POSES. A THREAT TO DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS TO PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. IT POSES SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT- INACCURACIES BY CITIES IN DISCRIMINATION. CONCERNS THAT ARE HEIGHTENED FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. OUR VIEW A CAN RACE TO THE BOTTOM IN AN UNREGULATED MARKET PLACE BENEFITS NO ONE. ABOVE ALL FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE YOU CAN MASS SURVEILLANCE OF THE POPULATION. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN CALLING FOR LAWS TO REGULATE PAYS A RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN OUR VIEW AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY ONE WOULD REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL STEP FORWARD IT WOULD IT WOULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS THAT DO NOT EXIST IN LAW TODAY. IT WOULD REGULATE THE PRIVATE SECTOR BY AMONG OTHER THINGS ADDRESSING CONCERNS OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION BY REQUIRING COMPANIES TO BE TRANSPARENT. BUT TAKEN TO TASK THEIR TECHNOLOGIES FOR BY IT THE END DISCRIMINATION BUT TO REQUIRE COMPANIES TO ENABLE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES TO TEST TAKE OUT THE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDE DISCRIMINATION. BUT TO REQUIRE COMPANIES TO TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS AN INACCURACY THERE BY THE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THEIR TECHNOLOGY. IT WOULD AND COMPANIES FROM IN ROLLING CONSUMERS PERSONAL DATA IN A FACE TO RECOGNITION SYSTEM WITHOUT OBTAINING CONSENT- OR IN SOME LIMITED. CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SECURITY OR SAFETY PURPOSES. IT WOULD BAN THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS ABOUT- CONSUMER. WITHOUT INSURANCE THE THIS IS THE I MEAN THANK YOU YOU. BUT ALSO IMPOSE MY NEEDED. ON THE GOV YOU OF THE TECHNOLOGY. JUST THE HIGHLIGHT A FEW IT WOULD REQUIRE STRONG OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT VIEWED THE PHASER RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. BY REQUIRING AMONG OTHER THINGS UP PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT- BEFORE AGENCIES WOULD YOU THE TECHNOLOGY IT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION. BEFORE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DECIDE TO PROCURE OR ADOPTED TECHNOLOGY BY AMONG OTHER THINGS REQUIRED PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT PERIODS BEFORE AGENCIES SECURE THE TECHNOLOGY- IT WOULD SET AN APPROPRIATELY HIGH BAR ON THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT BEING THAT YOU USE FOR ONGOING SURVEILLANCE UNLESS ONE FOURTH AND OBTAINED A WARRANT FOR EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST. IN FINAL IT WOULD APPROPRIATELY BANNED THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY- BOND POINT ON CONSUMERS. BASED ON THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT ACTIVITIES OR BASED ON THEIR MEMBERSHIP IN A PROTECTED CLASS. SO WE APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN EFFORT TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND FRANKLY ALL STAKEHOLDERS. LAWMAKERS ADVOCATE LAW ENFORCEMENT GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND MOVE THE- LEGISLATION BOARD THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER HARKINS OTHER OTHER SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT ON THE LINE. I HEARING NO OTHER SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT WILL MOVE TO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION- STARTING WITH MISTER WARD. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS YOUR CHAIR THIS VICE CHAIR. MY NAME IS GRANT WARD THEM- IN HERE IN OPPOSITION TO TWENTY SIX ONE. I AM THE PRESIDENT OF C. BUT SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY SHERIFF'S EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ASSOCIATION ALSO SERVED AS THE- BOARD APPOINTED PRESIDENT OF SCALE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE LAW ENFORCEMENT I SIT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OF CC ONLY A THE CALIFORNIA COALITION LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS POOR I CAN THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA- SO. IN MY OVER TWENTY TWO YEARS AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I'VE HAD THE OPTION YOU WORK NUMEROUS DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS AND ONE OF THOSE ASSIGNMENTS WAS AS A DETECTIVE IN CHARGE OF RESEARCHING IN ASSESSING BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES. FOR SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHO I AM. I'D FIRST LIKE TO. POINT OUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DEBT TO DEDICATE TIME AND RESOURCES TO OPPOSE LEGISLATION IS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING THIS CURRENT CRISIS. AT THE TIME WHEN OUR FULL FOCUS IS ON IS ON THE SHRINK OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IN MY CASE MY MEMBERS ARE SAFE AND LOOKED AFTER DURING THIS PANDEMIC IT UPSETS ME TO KNOW THE BILL'S LIKE THIS THAT HINDER ABILITY TO DO OUR JOBS. BILL BEING PUSHED FORWARD. WE UNDERSTAND AND AGREE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD BE REGULATED. ALL TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD BE WATCHED OVER. AND ENSURE OUR PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND PRIVACY NGUYEN REASONABLY EXPECTED IS PROTECTED. WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS SOLUTIONS. I WOULD LOVE TO GO INTO DETAIL REGARDING ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY ONE BUT FOR THE PURPOSES THIS HEARING- I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT TO MAJOR FLAW. THE EXTREME LIMITATION IS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE TOOL TO ONLY BE USED WHILE MESSI GETTING SERIOUS FELONY CRIMES. HOWEVER THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF CRIMES THAT ARE- ACTUALLY USEFUL PROVISION RECOGNITION ARE COMPLETELY PROHIBITED. IT'S CRIMES LIKE IDENTITY THEFT CHECK FRAUD CREDIT CARD FRAUD RETAIL THEFT AND BURGLARY THE CONSISTENTLY HAVE USABLE FACIAL RECOGNITION FROM SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FOOTAGE AND IN THIS STATE THOSE CRIMES ARE VERY RARELY DEEMS SELLING. A MAJOR ISSUE TO DO WITH MEN CHEATING A PURGE OF IMAGE TEMPLATES MORE THAN THREE YEARS OLD. THE IMAGES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USED TO COMPARE AGAINST. THE PROBE IMAGE ARE BOOKING PHOTOS THERE ARE NO EXPECTATIONS TO PRIVACY WHEN BOOKED INTO JAIL IN FACT FINGERPRINTING AND PHOTOGRAPHING. TIRED NEVER A PERFECT TIME TO ENROLL A PERSON INTO A DATABASE THEN LOOKING. BY THE END OF THAT PROCESS- WE KNOW EXACTLY WHO THAT PERSON IS AND IF THE PERSON IS NEVER BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE THE FIRST PROCESS ENSURES THE SAME VISUAL CAN BE AGAIN IDENTIFIED IN FUTURE REGARDLESS OF WHAT NAME OR INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE SOME SUBSEQUENT CONTACTS ONE FOR SOME. PERSON THIS FEATURE. TO HELP PROVIDE IN GATED LEAVES WHICH HOPEFULLY RESULT IN SOLVING CRIMES IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION. AS A CANDIDATE LIST OF PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR A SIMILAR FACIAL GEOMETRY. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ACTUAL CASE SUMMARIES OR ARRANGE A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT USES THE TECH.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO EVERYONE WHO TOOK THE TIME TO CALL IN AND WILL NOW BRING IT BACK FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE WOMAN- WAY. THANK YOU- I WANT TO- COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN MORE CARE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHICH I THINK IS OBVIOUSLY VERY VERY CRITICAL. THIS IS A NEWER TECHNOLOGY THAT THE DESPERATELY NEEDS- REGULATION. BUT YOU KNOW AS T'S WRITTEN WRITTEN TODAY I DON'T THINK THIS FRAMEWORK ADEQUATELY- PROTECTS CONSUMERS. PROTECTS OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND I PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THE RACIAL BIAS CONCERNS THAT EVEN FLAG BY. OF THE OPPOSITION AND HOW THIS BILL WILL IMPACT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR- I THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH LATITUDE THAT THE COMPANIES ARE GIVEN USE- FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THIS BILL- AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW COMPANIES WILL DETERMINE PROBABLE COPS- AND THIS GIVES THEM TOO MUCH FREE REIGN AND SO I RESPECTFULLY. WILL NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT- MY HOPE MISTER CHAIR THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. YOU KNOW THE IT ARE ABLE. I THINK STRENGTH IN THE CONSUMER PROTECTION EASE OF THIS IDEA. DIFFERENT THE BUT AND I. DID MY- FOR THIS BILL I HAVE O. OPPOSE IT TODAY. SOMEONE ORDERS OVER. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR SO- MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW THIS IS AN AT THAT ISSUE THAT YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT'S AN ISSUE THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GRAPPLING WITH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I THINK THE REASON WHY IT'S SUCH A DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT- ISN'T INHERENTLY SOMETHING THAT WE KEEP PRIVATE. UNTIL WE ARE THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF HAVING THAT INFORMATION SHARED ON A MASS LEVEL SO YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT I RECOGNIZE YOUR FACE WILL BE SITTING HERE AND I CAN TELL MY WIFE- TONIGHT I RAN INTO CHECK OUT THE CAPITAL YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT A PIECE OF PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT I REVEALED ABOUT YOU BUT I'M WE EXPAND THAT TO BEING DONE MILLIONS MILLIONS OF TIMES A DAY- THROUGH AN AUTOMATED PROCESS IT RAISES SOME VERY TROUBLING ETHICAL CONCERNS SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY WERE GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER I ALSO THINK IT'S WORTH VISUAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS ENABLING SOME. SOME BEHAVIOR THAT'S VERY BENEFICIAL TO ALL OF US HERE IN SOCIETY. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ESTABLISH A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT DOESN'T- DENY US THE BENEFITS OF THAT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER HERE IT SEEMS TO ME IS NOT FOCUS SO MUCH ON. THE POTENTIAL ABSES OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS IT IS TRYING TO CHECK ALL THE BOXES ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO DO TO DEPLOY IT. I THINK WE BE BETTER SERVED IF WE JUST FOCUSED ON. THE PUT THE POTENTIAL ABUSES AND PASSED LEGISLATION TO CURBING THOSE. INSTEAD OF- ATTEMPT STABLE. WORK SPECIFICALLY BEEN ABOUT IN A GIVEN OUR CURRENT SITUATION. WITH RUN OF OUR- THAT THAT'S POTENTIALLY BY. USE OF THE- RIGHT THROUGH AND TRY WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT YOU CAN SEE A TIME OF THE NOT SO DIFFERENT JUST A FUTURE WHERE YOU COULD USE. A PARTY TO TRACK AND TRACE- SUSPECTED CASES- I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN KNOWING OF GETTING AN AUTOMATED REPORT THE TOLD ME. IF I HAD THE NEXT CORONAVIRUS. USE PAPER RECOGNITION HER. I WANT. DOES YOUR BILL PROHIBITS BEHAVIOR BECAUSE IT'S MY READING OF A SEEMS SEEMS IT DOES. ALL THE BILL ITSELF DOES NOT REALLY- PROHIBIT DOT PER SE OF I THINK- DE UM. ARCTIC DE ARE YOUNGER DEFERRED TO- VIA MY WITNESS ON THIS QUESTION AS WELL BUT- YOU KNOW THE WAITED I FORESEE IT IT DOES NOT- YOU KNOW I COULD NOT FIND A LANGUAGE- PERTAINING TO THAT PARTICULAR- YOU KNOW USE BUT BUT I DON'T THINK IT DOES I MEAN I THINK WOULD DEPEND ON THE SOURCE OF THE IMAGE THAT YOU'RE USING FOR FEDERAL RECOGNITION IF IT WAS A PROP BUT SOURCE YEAH THEN I. WOULD NEED TO DO I CAN. TO HAVE GENERALIZED YOU KNOW IF THEY DID HAVE THAT I WOULDN'T DO IT WOULD BE AN ILLEGAL USE OF CAUGHT GO HEAD TO HEAD YEAH YOU PUBLIC COURSE DE. WE NEED SOME KIND OF EVIDENCE FOR THE CRIME YOU'VE WRITTEN. THE WAIT IT IS. OUR IT IS THAT. YOU KNOW I. PEOPLE COULD. USE IT FOR. THAT'S UP A- IN THE PUBLIC. I AND DOT. ANY GOV IN WEBSITES ANY. A THAT'S OF A TO PUBLIC AND IF YOU KNOW I THINK I'M SOMETHING ABOUT THE CLEAR FEEL A AYE PARTICULAR SITUATION WHERE THEY WERE ACTUALLY PROVIDING IMAGES THAT WERE NOT ONLY IN THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO OBTAINED ARE BY AND- TRANSFER FROM AS A FACEBOOK. SO THE BILL AT IS AS IS IT IS WRITTEN AUG WILL ONLY ALLOW FOR THE RETENTION OF INFORMATION THAT'S UP IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. SO OBSOLETE SO THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS WORKING. OKAY SO YEAH IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THOSE RAN RIGHT IF I MIGHT JUMP IN THIS IS RIGHT HARKENS OF MICROSOFT I DON'T BELIEVE THE BILL WOULD. PROHIBIT THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY FOR THOSE SORT THE PURPOSES- IT IT YOU KNOW. BUT ON THE ONE HAND REQUIRE- CONSENT- IF A PRIVATE SOURCES INTENDING TO USE THE- TECHNOLOGY FOR THOSE KINDS OF PURPOSES. ON THE OTHER HAND- NOT UNLESS. A GOVERNMENT% AGENCY IS ENGAGING AND- ONGOING SURVEILLANCE THEY THEY WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE ONE FIREMAN. SO IT IT'S KIND OF SPLIT HAIRS BUT- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT STATION THAT- THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T GIVEN MY CONSENT UNTIL AFTER THE FACT YOU KNOW WHERE I SAID OKAY I WOULD LIKE I'M IN NOW INTERESTED IN. HAVING YOU CAN TRACE ME MEANS THAT GOTTA GO BACK AND ANALYZE ALL OF THE PLACES I MIGHT HAVE BEEN. AS A POOR TO YOU KNOW FORWARD PROCESS WHERE- WHERE YOU'RE ANALYZING IT AS GO AND THEN I SAY YES I LIKE TO OPEN THE XPOSED ANYWAY LET'S MOVE OUR FROM THAT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE POINT BUT READING OF THE OF THAT THAT'S A PART. BETTER USE THAT MY READING THE BOOKS WITH A LAUGH YEAH THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THEY'RE PROBABLY. UNDER THE BENEFIT. IS WHERE. NEW THEM. SINCE BUT NEVER DEVELOP. WE'RE NOT. MISS IT OFF IN OUR APPROACH TO REGULATING. UP I HAVE A FALL QUESTION CARE ABOUT. A FEDERAL LAW. THERE WAS A CASE INTO. ELEVEN IN THE SUPREME. WHERE IT WAS IT WAS A- TO THE- OF IN. THAT WAS COLLECTED BY A BUSINESS. AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN THAT CASE. THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS. OF MAN RUSSIAN OF FREE SPEECH COMMERCIAL FREE SPEECH. YEAH ND I AM AND IT WAS A PRETTY STARKLY WORDED DECISION AND I'M WONDERING HOW. THIS WOULD NOT BE FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THAT DECISION BECAUSE PRETTY CLEARLY. IT IS S. AS REGARDS THE PART OF THE BILL THAT PUTS RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT BUSINESSES CAN DO WITH INFORMATION IS GATHERED ON THEIR PROMISED- PRETTY CLEARLY THAT WOULD FALL UNDER. THAT SAME CABIN INFORMATION NOT. I MR AGAINST AN ACID QUESTION. YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE STORE OVER BECAUSE I AND THAT'S HEALTH RATED KATE- AND FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- I THINK AT BEST YOU CAN SAY THAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT CASE ON. ANY LAW THAT-REGULATES. THE COLLECTION AND USE OF DATA PRIVACY LAWS THAT THIS LAW. IT IS DEBATABLE. I DO NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD RENDER THIS PLOT WAR BUT PRIVACY LAWS MORE GENERALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. AMONG OTHERS- JUSTICE KENNEDY IN THAT CASE. NOTED THAT THEY WERE NOT- RENDERING A DECISION AND- ADD TO THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FIRST AMENDMENT- AND PRIVATE LAWS IN THE PAST THE TECH. LOGY TO- TO LACK INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE. THERE THAT NUMBER OTHER REASONS WHY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT CASE WOULD. INVALIDATE THE PRIVACY LAWS OR- IN WITH WHICH WE CAN% GO INTO IF WE HAD MORE TIME. SURE YOU KNOW I WELL I THINK AT THE VERY LEAST. WE'LL THIS LAW WHAT IF IT PASSED FACED A CONCERT JAIL. AND I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I ACTUALLY THINK IT WOULD IT WOULD BE OVERTURNED. I FOR THE SAME REASONS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DATA THAT'S INHERENTLY PRIVATE WHEN I TALK ABOUT SOMEONE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WE TALK ABOUT SOMEONE'S APPEARANCE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE REVEAL TO EACH OTHER EVERY DAY. SO I SOME. OF WAS THERE. A BUT ONE WAY OR THE I WOULDN'T YOU TO COULD WORKING ON THIS IT'S ON SOMETHING THAT I CAN SUPPORT. TODAY I THINK IT'S AN INDICATION THAT YOU'VE GOT DISAGREEMENT FROM THE THINK YOU HAVEN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH. COMPARED AT THE SAME TIME YOU'VE GOT DISAGREEMENT THAT THAT. FROM PEOPLE THAT THINK YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR THAT MAYBE MEANS THAT YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH- I JUST. I DON'T THINK IT NOW THE TIME TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WHEN THE PERIOD OF REVIEW ON. THIS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN SHORTS ALL BE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MUCH. SOME WOMEN WHAT. THANK YOU MISS FRAZIER- MISTER TEARS YOU KNOW I'M A SUBSTITUTE MEMBER ON THIS COMMITTEE TODAY AND I KNOW YOU WORK EXTENSIVELY ON THIS ISSUE SO I'M GOING TO VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD BUT- I WOULD JUST CAUTION THAT GIVEN THE LEVEL OF A- OPPOSITION. THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WILL BECOME LAW SO I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK- THIS ISSUE EXTENSIVELY IT'S AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT NEEDS- NEEDS LAW HE'S REGULATIONS SO I. APPLAUD YOU FOR ENGAGING. ISSUE BUT I KNOW THAT- GIVEN THE OPPOSITION- YOU'LL MOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO A WORK AT. IN A CONSIDERABLE WAY TO GET IT TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL. TODAY AT. SOME MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON SOME OF THE DETAILS IN THE BILL- IT'S IS THAT WHEN THERE. OFFICIAL TECHNOLOGY THERE WILL BE IN COURT TO MEANINGFUL HUMAN REVIEW. WHAT WHAT IS OUR DEFINITION FOR WHAT MEANING FOR HUMAN REVIEW IS WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. OUR THAT MEANS IS THAT ANY DECISIONS THAT WOULD HI HOW THE LEGAL EFFECT ALL WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS SO BEING DEPLOYED. WOULD REQUIRE SOMEBODY WHO'S TRAINED AND HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION. TO THAT THAT. YOU KNOW THE AS FAR AS WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN BY LEGAL EFFECT OUT I THINK THAT'S A LIST OF OTHER THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT INCLUDING LENDING LAWS FOR EXAMPLE SOMEBODY WANTS TO- APPLY FOR A LOAN. HOUSING INSURANCE EDUCATION YES AND THAT. THE AND I DON'T MEAN IN BUT SO DID MY QUESTION IS ON THAT SIDE IT'S MORE THEY CAN REVIEWS SITE RIGHT WHO IS IT WHO. THIS YEAR THANK YOU TO BE. PRIVATE COMPANY THAT YOU THE FOR ARE. I MEAN WHO IS A LEFT TO OUR ANY STATE. THAT GOING TO BE A PLACE TO THE TERM WHAT THAT REVIEW MEANS BIG. MEANINGFUL THAN I AM BEHOLDER RIGHT AFTER. WELL THE YOU KNOW% THE LAW SAYS THAT YOU KNOW ANY DECISION REGARDING GET OUT OF THE ITEMS THAT I MENTIONED WOULD HAVE TO BE READ REVIEW BY A HUMAN BEING WE'VE BEEN TRYING AS TO WHO'S GONNA. GEN THEN NOT COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THAT THE SELF. YEAH SOME MISTER CHAIRED BY THIS I'M SORRY IF I MIGHT THIS IS RYAN HARKENED AGAIN- I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS A DEFINED TERM IN THE BILL. AND IT DOES PROVIDE AS AS MISTER CHAIR OF NOTED THAT THAT THE IN AN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE TRAINED AND IT ALSO MUST BE SOMEONE WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE DECISION. SO IT AS BEST WE READ THAT ANYWAY EIGHT- I THINK THAT THE CLEAR INTENT IT IS THE INDICATE THAT YOU CAN'T JUST BE A LOW LEVEL EMPLOYEE WHO SIMPLY PUSHING A BUTTON OR OR MOVING PAPERS ACROSS HER DESK IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE. WITH AUTHORITY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION TO RENDER THE DECISION AND SOMEONE FRANKLYWHO CAN CHANGE THE DECISION- YOU KNOW IT MAY BE THAT THERE IS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL. THE FLUSH OUT WHAT THAT IS- BUT WE THINK THAT THE CURRENT DEFINITION THE BILL IT IS A GOOD START- IN WOULD START TO. YOU KNOW PUT SOME RESTRICTIONS AROUND AN AREA WHERE THERE REALLY AREN'T RESTRICTIONS TODAY. THANK THANK YOU AND I GUESS YEAH MY CONCERN IS THAT. IT THE MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THAT HUMAN REVIEW THAT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT AND SO YOU KNOW HE JUST LEAVE IT TO THAT COMPANY. YOU KNOW IF THE COMPANY IS TELLING THAT PERSON HIGH LEVEL LOW LEVEL MID LEVEL WHATEVER TRAIN NOT TRAINED. YEAH DID TO IMPROVE USES THAT SHOULDN'T BE APPROVED THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM- AND SO I DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT THAT NEED MORE DEFINITION. THE BILL SHOULD THERE BE SOME BASE SO FOR. WHAT IN BECAUSE- NECESSARY FOR THE PROVISION OF THAT SERVICE. MEANS AND THIS IS KIND OF THE SAME ISSUE- WHERE YOU KNOW HE IS A PROBLEMATIC TO JUST LEAVE TO EACH BUSINESS. TO DECIDE WHAT IS. CAN QUOTE DIRECTLY NECESSARY FOR THE PROVISION OF THAT SERVICE. OR MAYBE THERE'S MORE DEFINITION THE BILL THAT THAT THAT I MISSED ALREADY. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS- ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE- CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER. I BELIEVE- SECTION THREE TEN E. ONE OR THEREABOUTS AND- MAYBE MAYBE THE BEST WAY TO TOOL- RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION IS- IT BY USING AN X. AN EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE- FOR EXAMPLE YOU HOW- SOMEBODY USING AND HOW. THAT WOULD. POSSIBLY CAPTURE THE IMAGE OF THE LAYER- SO THE LEVEL OF- CONSENT. IS REQUIRE AND THE BILL IN SUCH A WAY THAT GIVE GIVE THE GAME ITSELF IF THE APPLICATION ITSELF WHAT A REQUIRES. THE PERSON'S IMAGE TO BE CAPTURED AND THAT IS THE THAT IS THE CONSENT THAT DOES REQUIRE NOW HOW HOWEVER IF THAT PICTURE OF THE OF THAT IMAGE HAS TO BE USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE. OF THE ADULT SO. CONSENT WOULD BE NEEDED AS WELL NOW. THE ARE BUT IF YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THE PERSON GIVES CONSENT FIRST TIME DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU KNOW IF I CAN COULD BE FOR FURTHER DISSEMINATED TO A THIRD PERSON. SO IF THAT HAPPENS IN A SEPARATE TENTS AND WE REQUIRE. JOHN GOTCHA AN AID AGAIN THE KIND OF SOMEONE A LAST QUESTION MY CONCERN IS JUST. ANY BODY CAN JUSTIFY REASON TO USE ANYTHING- AND SO IF THERE ARE NO STANDARDS THERE FOR HOUSTON PERMISSIVE USES. OF THE YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE. DIRECTLY NECESSARY FOR THE VERSION OF THAT SERVICE IS SO VERY THAT THAT YEAH YOU CAN PROBABLY JUSTIFY ANY. DECISION YOU KNOW BASED ON ON THAT KIND OF A DESCRIPTION SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY TIGHTENED UP- AND THEN IT YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS AROUND- YOU KNOW. THIS TECHNOLOGY NOT BEING USED FOR NOT REINFORCING BIAS HE'S AROUND RACE AND GENDER AND AGE- SO I GUESS YEAH CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY ISN'T BIASED BASED ON- YOU KNOW THOSE FACTORS CHAIR I THINK THERE'S SEVERAL LEVELS OF PROTECTION IN THAT REGARD FIRST OF ALL OF THE LAW REQUIRES THE OF TESTING TO BE DONE THE TESTING HAS TO BE INDEPENDENT ARE. A WELL. MAKE SURE THAT OF. DE OF SUB GROUPS AND NOT BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. OF YEAH WE ALSO PROVIDED THE THIS STANDARD AS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. SO NOW PERSON- USING THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD HAVE. TO BASICALLY SUPPLIED THE WHAT THEY CALLED IN ON. THE API WHICH QUALITY APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE. FOR AN INDEPENDENT PARTY TO VERIFY TO TELL US. AND IF THEY- IF THE TEST ACTUALLY COMPLIES WITH THE NEW STANDARD AND THERE OKAY. NOW ARE THAT'S ONE LEVEL OF SAFEGUARD THAT'S ON THE ON THE TESTING PART. NOW THE OTHER PART IS THAT. ON THE ENROLLMENT HE'S YOU KNOW BEFORE THE IMAGES- AND ROLLED INTO A DATABASE THAT A CONSENT YOU KNOW CONSENT WILL BE NEEDED AS WELL. SO THAT'S A SECOND. NOW THE PIECES THAT. WHEN IT COMES pTO SURVEILLANCE- EXAMPLE OF. YEAH THAT BE ALLOWED UNDER LIMITED SIR. THAT IS IF IT'S A SIN CRIME. AND ALSO IF THERE'S A WARRANT REQUIREMENT. BONTA AS WELL AS SET UP YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S ALSO THE- YOU KNOW THE PROVISION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION ON THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. YEAH OKAY. I. I'M GONNA VERY BEGRUDGINGLY SUPPORT THIS TODAY TO GIVE YOU MORE TIME TO WORK ON A LOT OF THESE DETAILS WE GOT A LOT OF THIS VERY LATE AND DIDN'T HAVE A TON OF TIME TO WHAT YOU KNOW TO WORK WITH MY STAFF AND PERSONALLY REVIEW THINGS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AREA WHERE THERE'S MINIMAL REGULATION EXISTING NOW AND SO I DO THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN- I THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BY BY GROUPS ALL OF THE SPECTRUM- YEAH THERE ARE SOME VALID CONCERNS THERE- AND SO ON I NO ONE'S. AND RESPECT YOU IN THE KNOW THAT YOU. YOU'RE WORK. WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS BEING THE TECHNOLOGY AND I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS NOTHING. AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING- BUT YOU KNOW THE GUY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE I THINK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT. WHAT THAT SWEET SPOT IS. OF EXPRESSED SOME OF MY- EARNS. THE OBVIOUS RESERVE. THE RIGHT TO. CHANGE THAT DECISION BASED ON HOW THIS GOAL PROGRESSES- BUT- I'LL BE WILLING TO GIVE YOU A- I COURTESY I'VE TODAY TO LET YOU KEEP WORKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THANK YOU. A SOMEONE OR ONE. I THINK OF THAT WAS LIFELONG DAY CREATE NEW OF WORKING ON THE RIGHT OR. TECHNOLOGY WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PRETTY EARLY. A LOT YEAR OR. LIKE THAT PRIVATE. AND RIGHT I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING. WHAT THEY- AND- RIGHT OR- THAT. WHILE I DO WANT TO SAY SOME THE RECENT AND THEN- ONE MORE. I CERTAINLY. FIVE AND OF YEAH WE WOULDN'T I THINK ONE LAW. FOR OKAY PROBABILITY YEAH OVERSIGHT BUT- SORRY. WE WANT WE WANT LAUNCH TO A PRO OKAY AND BUT WE ALSO DO NOT WANT TO HAMPER THEIR ABILITY TO SOLVE CRIMES AND SO I HOPE THAT YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AND WORK WITH ALL THE- OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL THAT YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT THE- FOR VICTIMS OF CRIMES. TO FOR THE POLICE NOT TO HAVE CERTAIN TOOLS I THINK. IS REALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND SO- I'VE I HOPE TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS ON THE FLOOR AND ALL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK YOU. SOMEONE CREEL. THANK YOU TEST TEST THIS WORKING OKAY. THANK YOU- FIRST- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS VERY SENSITIVE MATTER AS A YOUR EFFORT AND ALSO AN ENGAGING ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS- WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY WHEN IT COMES TO A LOT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND IN DOING SO WAS ALSO. EMBRACE THIS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY IN THE REFORMS THAT GO ALONG SIDE OF THAT THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN REGARDING. YOUR LADY TO TWENTY TWO SIXTY ONE I WANT TO REMIND AND NOT GLOSS OVER SOMETHING THAT USE THAT YOU STATED WHEN YOU FIRST- BEGAN YOUR COMMENTS AND REMIND THIS COMMITTEE THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING- OR LISTENING. THAT YOU YOURSELF AS YOU STATED HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY A RECOGNIZED BY THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY YOU ARE A LEADER WITHIN YOUR API COMMUNITY IN THE CHINESE UNIT. YOUR LEADER AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR WHICH IS IMPACT THE MOST US WITH IN BY THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION MY TRUCK. YOU CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE DONE THE WORK NEFF. TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE MOVING GOOD POLICY FORWARD THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP BOTH IN OPPOSITION. LEADS ME TO BELIEVE ALSO THAT YOU'VE REACHED A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE NO ONE'S HAPPY- AND WE KNOW HERE THAT OFTEN TIMES. THAT'S THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE IN TERMS OF WHAT DETERMINES TO BE GOOD POLICY IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIND. A MIDDLE GROUND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR YOUR BILL TODAY I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO THIS MY FIRST DAY ON THIS COMMITTEE. SO THIS IS THE BEEN INCREDIBLY AND LIGHTNING. AND ALSO TO SEE THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE MANAGE THE BILLS BEFORE IT BEFORE HAND. AND THI INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT COULD REALLY SET THE TONE FOR THE STATE AND THE REST OF THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO THIS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. AND FACIAL RECOGNITION SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER- AT CHAO AND I- I I'LL JUST SAY YOU KNOW A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE WORK TOGETHER ON A RESOLUTION THAT WAS SORT OF A FIRST ATTEMPT TO COME UP WITH A SET OF PRINCIPLES. ARE RELATED TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF. TRANSFORMING OUR WORLD AN EXTRAORDINARY AND REALLY UNIMAGINABLE WAYS. AND I WANT THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT RESOLUTION PASSES COMMITTEE PASSED THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE- WAS HAVING AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH- POLICYMAKERS AROUND. A MERGING TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT WE COULD- ASSURE THAT THE BENEFITS ARE REALIZED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND IS WIDELY SPREAD AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE COULD. GET RISKS ARE INHERENT IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO SO THAT WE COULD- MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A BACKLASH AGAINST NEW TECHNOLOGIES- THAT'LL ONLY ENTERS PROGRESS. ICE THIS BILL. RE BRINGING SOME OF THOSE TO THE FORE. AND OUT OF FACE. AND TECHNOLOGISTS VERY BEGINNING OF THE TECHNOLOGIES WERE WILL BE HAVING- THESE DEBATES. AND I THINK THAT. THE BALANCE YOUR STRIKING HERE. YOU KNOW IS OBVIOUSLY FAR FROM PERFECT BUT IS HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO- I AM. HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THE BILL TODAY I'LL JUST MENTION A FEW- ISSUES THAT OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED AS WELL I THINK THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- I THINK THAT THAT. THE IDEA OF CONSENT- REALLY NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND ON THE GETS OLD ONLY GONNA BE WORKABLE FOR CONSUMERS TO HAVE TO GIVE AN INDIVIDUALIZED CONSENT TO EACH ESTABLISHMENT. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED I THINK A BETTER SOLUTION THERE AND THEN MORE BROADLY. THE QUESTION OF HOW THIS RELATES TO. LOCAL ORDINANCES OR REGULATIONS OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT I THINK NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH A LITTLE BIT MORE MAYBE THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE. A STATE WHAT SORT OF ISLAM THAT'LL JURY OTHER STATES SIX. THEIR AREAS WE WANT TO HAVE UNIFORMS STAND AND IT'S NOT ENTIRELY TO ME WHETHER THE- JUST THAT WOULD THAT THOSE BE IN MIND IS FORWARD. AND I AM NOT PETER MOVED. BECAUSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EL MEMBERS UP FOR FALL IMMEDIATELY ME. EXCEL THE AMENDMENTS- TODAY- AND ALSO I WANT TO RELAY A MESSAGE FROM THE LA COUNTY REGIONAL IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM OF THAT HAS BEEN CONVEYED TO ME EARLIER ON IT SAYS OUR OFFICE AS AN INITIAL POSITIVE VIEW OF THE BILL- FROM THE LA COUNTY HI DE IDENTIFICATIONSYSTEM JUST FOR IT TO. COMMITTEES INFORMATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO CLOSE- SO I LIKE TO CLOSE TODAY'S DISCUSSION WITH A LITTLE HISTORICAL CONTACTS. UP IN TWO THOUSAND ONE ON THEN SENATOR DEBORAH BOWL AND AUTHOR SP ONE SIXTY NINE. A BILL THAT INTENDED TO RESTRICT THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL PRIVACY AND THE SECURITY OF THE COLLECTED DATA. THAT BILL IS REFLECTED IN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY ANALYSIS AT THE TIME. WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FROM AMONG OTHER THINGS COLLECTING OR USING BIOMETRIC. INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM A USER FISH CONDITION TECHNOLOGY. IT ACCEPTED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHEN ACTING PURSUANT TO A WARRANT. AND AUTHORIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH SPECIFIC INFORMATION WITHOUT WHO NEED ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION FOR PURPOSES OF THE PROSECUTION OR DEFENSE OF A CRIMINAL CASE. A FURTHER THE MEASURE WOULD HAVE PERMITTED PRIVATE ENTITIES TO USE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN SITUATIONS WHERE A CONSUMER INITIATES A TRANSACTION AND THAT CONSUMER CONSENT TO THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. IN ALL OTHER CASES BUSINESSES COULD HOW. COULD ONLY COLLECT BIOMETRIC IDENTIFIER INFORMATION AND ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY AND USING FACIAL RECOGNITION WHEN IT IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO MAKE PUBLIC SAFETY. OR TO PROTECT AGAINST A VOTE OF LAW AND WHEN SINCE AS PER TO AND CAN SPEAK NOTED THAT THE FROM IS COLLECTED. FINAL BILL ALL RESTRICTED THE IN BUSINESSES MAY SELL OR SHARE INFORMATION AND INTO TO BE. WHETHER Y. SECURE UNDER ACCESS. OF FINALLY IT ALSO THE MEASURE AND POSE VARYING CIVIL- PENALTIES. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WERE GROUPS LIKE THE ACLU AND THE PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE TODAY SOME OF THESE GROUPS CALL MY BILL MISGUIDED AND DANGEROUS- WHICH IS ALSO AN IMPEDIMENT FORCED TO RETURN TO A SAFE AND FREE SOCIETY. I'M LAST YEAR WHEN I AUTHOR A. B. TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WHICH WOULD SIMPLY REQUIRED BUSINESS TO DISCLOSE WHEN THEY'RE USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SIMILAR TO SB ONE SIXTY NINE THE ACLU AND THE PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE ALSO POSTED. IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THE ACLU ROLE IN SUPPORT OF THAT BILL SB ONE SIXTY NINE AND A QUOTE HERE. WE ARE ENTERING AN ERROR WITH TECHNOLOGY IS OUTPACING I'LL BASIC PRIVACY RIGHTS. FURTHER BETWEEN HIGH TECH COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENT THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BE MADE. AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF PRIVACY TO BE LOST. A GOVERNMENT LESS EXERCISE SOME CONTROL OVER THERE THE RAPIDLY DE DEVELOPING USE OF- SOPHISTICATED FACE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS BEFORE BECOME A SOCIETY UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE. IT HAS BEEN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS SINCE THAT LEGISLATION FAILED PASSAGE DESPITE HAVING THE SUPPORT OF SOME OF THE VERY SAME GROUPS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION BY BILL TODAY. AND I WILL NOTE THAT SB ONE SIXTY NINE WAS PRE NINE ELEVEN AND THAT SINCE THEN SOME OF THESE GROUPS HAVE REPOSITIONED THEIR STANCE. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT INCOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT STANCE AB ONE SIXTY NINE PROHIBIT THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. HOWEVER THE OPPOSITION ADMITS TODAY AND THEIR LETTER. TO THIS BILL AND I QUOTE THAT EIGHT ICE IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF STATE AND PRIVATE FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS THE TARGET IMMIGRANTS POLICE HAVE USED IT TO TARGET PEOPLE OF COLOR GOVERNMENTS ARE USING IT TO A PRESS RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND DISCOURAGE FREE EXPRESSION. THIS MEANS THAT THE INTEGRATION OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OUR EVERYDAY LIVES HAS PERSISTED OVER A SPAN OF TWENTY YEARS BY BOTH PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENT ACTORS. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ADDRESS THE USE OF F. R. T. AND LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE BODY ONE CAMERAS WITH A THREE YEAR MORATORIUM. SO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THREE YEARS IF WE DO NOTHING HERE TODAY. IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY AS WAS THE CASE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY COSTLY. AND DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT THESE REGULATIONS SINCE MORE ENTITIES WILL HAVE DEVELOPED FRT INFRASTRUCTURES WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THESE COMMENTS FOR THESE LIMITS. DO WE WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE ONLY TO LOOK BACK TO THIS DAY IS A TIME. WHERE WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO CONTROL THE FATE OF OUR FUTURE AS IT RELATES TO THE TECHNOLOGY. I'M NOT WILLING TO WAIT AND WE CAN ACT NOW TO FINISH THE WORK. THAT'S THE WE STARTED WITH THE SP ONE SIX NINE AND WE CAN DO IT COLLECTIVELY SO WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR IBM. MOTION IS IT DO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS MONTHS AFTER IT WAS CALLED. I THINK WE HAVE A SECOND FROM SOMEONE CARILLO. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. CHAO HI CHAO AYE KILEY AYE KILEY AYE OUR QUE HAN. THERE CAN NO BERMAN. BERMAN I MEDINA. MEDINA I CARILLO CREEL I MULLIN. MULLIN I GALLAGHER. IRWIN FIVE IRWIN I OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NO WICKS NOW WORKS NOW. THE BILL IS OUT WE HAVE A SECOND BILL FROM MR CHOW AT THIS IS A BE TWO THREE TWO ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CHAIR AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR BOTH OF YOU. AB TWENTY THREE TO WOULD REQUIRE THAT CONTRACTORS DOING BUSINESS WITH A STATE AGENCY TO MAINTAIN CYBER INSURANCE. IF THE CONTRACTOR RECEIVES OR HOUSE ACCESS TO RECORDS CONTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE CONTRACTING STATE AGENCY WOULD DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF CYBER INSURANCE SUFFICIENT TO COVER LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CYBER SECURITY BREACH. IN RECENT YEARS SO WE HAVE SEEN CYBER ATTACKS AND DATA BREACHES SO SKYROCKETED. MANY OF US HAVE HEARD OF THE HACKING INCIDENT ON THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT OPM IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHERE THE SENSITIVE INFORMATION. OF TWENTY ONE MILLION AMERICANS WAS EXPOSED. THESE PEOPLE WERE AWAITING THEIR BACKGROUND CHECKS. SINCE THE COVER NINETEENTH ENDEMIC HIT TE CYBERATTACKS INCREASE OVER SIX HUNDRED PERCENT. HOSPITALS WERE HIT BY RANSOMWARE ATTACKS AND BREACHES AFFECTING TE LAB TESTING OF THE VIRUS. BY LIKING- STAFF FROM DATA INPUT PATIENT INFORMATION. DRUG DOSAGE HAVING BEEN STOLEN AND DELAY IN PROVIDING. CRITICAL CARE EVEN LEADING TO DOUBTS. STATE AGENCIES ARE JUST AS VULNERABLE FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN THE LAST TWO THREE YEARS CYBER CRIMINALS ALSO HIT ON THE CALIFORNIA MEN OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- OF- FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- AND ALSO SOME OF THE YOU SEE AND CAL STATE CAMPUSES AND- LIKE BAKER BILL A BILL BECAUSE IT. ARE OUR- SORRY. THE LIST GOES ON. THESE IT IT REACHES ALL DESIGNED TO DISRUPT AN ORGAN BILL AND THEY COME IN FORMS LIKE MAILLET A RANSOM DENIAL O SERVICE WITH OBJECTIVES TO COMPROMISE THEIR NETWORKS AND SENSITIVE DATA THEY COULD ALSO IMPACT A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES SUCH AS ALL PUBLIC RATE HOSPITALS NOT TO MENTION THE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE THAT THEY CREATE CYBER INSURANCE SO WILL HELP ADDRESS THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CYBER ATTACKS BY HELPING AN ORGANIZATION TO MITIGATE RISKS- EXPO BY OFFSETTING COST INVOLVED. WITH THE RECOVERY AFTER A SIDE OF REACH THE AVERAGE COST OF AN ATTACK IS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. CYBER INSURANCE WOULD ALSO HELP TO ONE INCENTIVIZE AN ORGANIZATION TO BILL ROBUST. CYBER SECURITY SYSTEM AND ALSO TO ENCOURAGE BEST PRACTICES SO WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION IT'S IN FACT ESTIMATED THAT 60% OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES GO OUT OF BUSINESS WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF A CYBER ATTACK. IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST 25% OF THE ANNUAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING DOLLARS IS BEING PAID. TO CERTIFY SMALL BUSINESSES A CYBER INSURANCE CAN HELP PROTECT CONSTITUENTS AND TAXPAYERS WHO RELY ON SALL BUSINESSES SERVICES. IN ADDITION STATE AGENCIES HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER THE INFORMATION PRACTICES ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OR IPA. THE ACT EVEN ALLOWS FOR CIVIL ACTION OF DAMAGES TO BE FILED AGAINST A GOVERNMENT AGENCY WHICH IS AN EX. ALEX EXCEPTION TO THE GOVERNMENT IMMUNITY THAT NORMALLY PROTECTS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY FROM TORT CLAIMS. ALL OF THIS MAKES IT IMPERATIVE FOR A CONTRACTORS DOING BUSINESS WITH THE STATE WHAT. ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION TO CARRY SO SURE IS SO I RESPECT AS YOUR- OF PORT IN I'VE- THANK GOD WE HAVE ANY. IN SUPPORT HERE WITH US IN THE ROOM. HOW ABOUT- WITH US BY PHONE. YOU HAVE A COMMENT AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY TWO. SURE NO SPEAKERS AND SUPPORT WE DO HAVE TWO SPEAKERS DESIGNATED IN OPPOSITION WHO I BELIEVE ARE BOTH WITH US BY PHONE. I WILL NOT START WITH MS CURTIS. FROM THE FROM CLEARLY. WE CAN. GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY DURING THESE TRYING TIMES AND PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MY NAME'S LAURA CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF COMP HERE THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE AND MISTER OF STAFF AND HIS ANALYSIS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THE BILL WITH OUR COALITION HOWEVER WE ARE HERE AT. THE EIGHTY TWENTY THREE ONE THE MEMBER OF OUR ORGANIZATION HAVE A MUTUAL GOAL OF ENSURING PRIVACY IN PROTECTING SENSITIVE DATA HOWEVER THE PROPOSED STATEWIDE TYPE INSURANCE MANDATE AS DEFINED WILL ONLY DRIVE UP THE COST A STATE AGENCY CONTRACT AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY WOULD CREATE ADDITIONAL AND UNNECESSARY FINANCIAL BURDENS ON ORGANIZATIONS CONTRACTING STATE AGENCY THERE ARE MEN OF PAPER INSURANCE SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED IF NEEDED DURING THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS RATHER THAN THEY DID MANAGE. YOUR TECHNOLOGY BUT- ALL APPROACH WHICH AND- TECHNICAL LOOKS. THAT THE PRO GETS IN A- THAT. PROCURED AND SO. AND DETERMINE THE- INSURANCE NEEDS FOR PARTICULAR ARE HE- BASED ON A RELEASED REALISTIC AND NECESSARY COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT IF AND WHAT LEVELS OF CYBER INSURANCE ARE CALLED FOR IN LIGHT OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THE INFORMATION BALK. OTHER AVAILABLE CURRENT POLICIES THAT MAKE COVER LOSSES AND EXPLODED ARREST AMONG OTHER FACTORS WE CURRENTLY SEE NO BARRIERS TO THE ABILITY OF STATE AGENCIES TO REQUEST I BRING TRYING TO WHEN AND WHERE THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE. IN FACT CONTRACTORS TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO KERRY INSURANCE LOST COVERAGE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY DEMANDING IT CONTRACTORS CARRY HIGHER LOST COVERAGE. WE ARE GOING TO AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDEN CONTRACTORS WHICH WILL. OF ENTRY FOR NEWER OR SMALLER COMPANIES TO MAYBE. THIS IS. BECAUSE IS LIKE TO SEE TO BETTER RESULTING IN HIGHER. ACOSTA THIS. IN CLOSING WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT STATE MANDATES A CRACKED UP UNDER SECOND. AND IT FEELS TO CREATE A BETTER OUTCOME FOR THE PARTIES INVOLVED ESPECIALLY THE- FOR THIS REASON AND WE ARE- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALISPELL. BUT IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIS STAFF AND- THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THAT. MEASURE THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. WE APPRECIATE. THANK YOU ALSO SPEAKING OUT IN OPPOSITION IS MISTER MUHAMMAD. THIS WHAT MUHAMMAD CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CAN HEAR ME CORRECTLY. YES WE CAN. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO BE HEARD HERE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE AND- THANK YOU TO THE STAFF AND COMMITTEE OF COURSE WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENTION- THE GO TO THE PRO BUT IT'S OUT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THE LANGUAGE- THE READ CONCERNS PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL. SO I WANT DRUG BE MADE TODAY FIRST EXCUSE ME FIRST BILL LANGUAGE IS UNCLEAR IT REGARDS TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THAT ARE THE BILL WOULD FOR EXAMPLE BENEFIT FROM BUYING WHETHER BIT HIS WITH STAYING CARP WHICH ARE RECALL TO A POINT A DUPLICATE. SEPARATE POLICIES FOR A DUPLICATE COUNTRY COVERAGE FOR CONTRACTOR THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED. WE CAN REQUIRE TO PURCHASING. COULD BE TIED TO WHAT THE CON ITSELF AND BY RECEIVE PERSON FROM. BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES NOT EXACTLY ADDRESS THIS- AN ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO BELIEVE THE BILL INTENDS TO BE PERSPECTIVE ONLY. AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD CONSIDER ADDING EXPRESS LANGUAGE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE CONTRACTORS SECURITY CYBER INSURANCE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL LOSSES RESULTING FROM POTENTIAL UNLAWFUL ACCESS TO OR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION- THIS LANGUAGES ARE. PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE OF THE TERM ALL LOSSES COULD INCLUDE WATER THEY'RE NOT IS ALSO THE CONTRACTORS BREACH OF THE AGREEMENT. AND THE TERM POTENTIAL UNLAWFUL ACT SIR DISCLOSURE IS NOT TAILORED BY ANY MEASURABLE HARM- THIRDLY RELATES TO THE AMOUNT. BRIDGE COVERAGE THE BILLSTATES THAT IT SHALL BE IN AN AMOUNT DETERMINED BY THE CONTRACTING AGENCY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LANGUAGE HERE COULD BE. IT FROM GARDEN. WE SHOULD THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE REQUIRE BY STATE AGENCIES IT'S A ALL RELATED TO THE OF DAY. OR THE SENSE OF THE DATA OR EVEN THE SIZE OF THE CONTRACT AND IN THAT SAME BEING WE DO BELIEVE THAT INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE BEST ADDRESSED DURING THE RP PROFITS BUT BECAUSE- STATE MANDATES DRIVE UP. OUR BARRIERS OF ENTRY FOR BUSINESSES WANT TO COMPETE FOR THE CONTRACT AND THAT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BUT AFTER. BY LIMITING COMPETITION AND ULTIMATELY DRIVING UP COST TAXPAYERS LOOK FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY POSE AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR LET ME TO SPEAK. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE ROOM OR ON THE TELEPHONE. WE DO HAVE SOMEONE IN Q. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. YOUR LINE IS OPEN FOR COMMENT. HI THIS IS COURTNEY JENSEN WEDTECH MATT- ALSO IN OPPOSITION AND ECHO THE COMMENTS- YEAH AND THAT CALIFORNIA PROPERTY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT HEARING NO OTHER SPEAKERS IN UP. IT WAS THERE ANOTHER SPEAKER OPPOSITION I'M SORRY. NOW THERE'S ONE UP OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU LET'S TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES SOMEONE ON THE- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE IS ALL OF A LOT OF POTENTIAL WITH CYBER- INSURANCE AND THIS IS BEEN A DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD AT AND CSL AT- YOU KNOW WITH WITH LEGISLATORS THAT ARE WORKING ON CYBER ISSUES OF OVER THE LAST YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THE MID THE INDUSTRY IS JUST NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO GET THAT THERE'S NO REAL CONSISTENCY AND THE COVERAGE AND OF THAN WE DID HEAR ANECDOTALLY THAT A LOT OF THESE- CYBER INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY OF THAT WHEN A COMPANY AT IS THE OR GOVERNMENT HAS A RANSOM WHERE IT ACT. THAT OF THEIR JUST SETTLING AND PAYING OFF THE RANSOMWARE AND AT AS YOU KNOW THAT'S EXTREMELY BAD POLICY FOR ESPECIALLY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BECAUSE IT JUST ENCOURAGES THE- PACKERS TO CONTINUOUS SO I KNOW VENTURE DO THE THAT CYBER INSURANCE IS THAT THAT IS THAT. IT'S GOING TO MATURE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THIS COULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SO- I'M GONNA BE LAYING ON BILL TODAY. SOMEONE WILL ROOMS IN. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR UP MR CHOW WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO A REACTS TO A CAL CHAMBERS QUESTION ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY BY WHICH A- CONTRACTING AGENCY WOULD GO ABOUT CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED INSURANCE GIVEN THE BROAD LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THAT SAYS. A SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL LOSSES RESULTING FROM POTENTIAL UNLAWFUL ACCESS. HI YES OF AT THIS POINT WE DON'T WANT THE LANGUAGE TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE AND I THINK- IT IS PRUDENT FOR US TO ALLOW THAT DECISION TO BE MADE- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- AT THIS AGENCY LEVEL- SO THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S- WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING COVER WHAT- BUT THE CALL YOU KNOW THE- POLICY OUGHT TO BE SO- I THINK THAT- THE DECISION IS TO ALLOW THE AGENCIES TO THIS QUESTION- TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW MUCH ARE THE POLICY OUGHT TO BE AND ALSO WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING COVER- OF HEAVY SAID THAT I THINK. D. ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE DEFINITELY FLEXIBLE AND OPEN TO- TAKING A LANGUAGE- ARE GOING FORWARD I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A CURFEW OTHER ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED THOUGHT WHICH I DEEM TO BE R. M. AS- AND- NOT BEING. AS FOR AS THE- THIS WILL I THINK WE CAN ALSO TAKE DOES WELL BECAUSE SOME TO NOT REALLY DEAL WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION IT'S A LIBRARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AND ALSO THE- TO PUT IT IF NATURE OF- LET'S SEE. WHAT'S REQUIRED UNDER THIS LAW AND EXISTING POLICIES SO I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT. FULL TO PAY EXTRA REDUNDANT POLICY OF- SO I THINK THAT CAN BE- THAT CAN BE MODIFIED AS WELL- AS WELL AS THE OTHER OTHER ISSUES THAT DOESN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP- SO YEAH SO I TOTALLY. UNDERSTAND IT AND THE CONCERN RAISED AND- UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO REALLY LOOK INTO THE ISSUE. ALL WHEN THIS ISSUE SURFACE SO I COULD JUST HAVE A COUPLE DAYS AGO. SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO LOOK LOOK INTO AND ALSO TRY TO FIX THANK YOU I SHARE THAT CONCERN WITH THE BROADNESS OF THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE- A JUST PLAIN READING OF THE BILL WHEN IT SAYS. SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL LOSSES WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE AN EXTREME VIEW POINT OF. THE VERY MAXIMUM OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS WHEREAS OTHER CUT FORMS OF INSURANCE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT IT'S DONE. AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRES DRIVERS TO HAVE LIABILITY INTO. BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE WERE A COUPLE COVER. ATTENTION AND SO MAYBE YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE. SAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT IT AS YOU SAY. GIVING THE CONTRACTING AGENCY THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE A REASONABLE AMOUNT BUT NOT PRESCRIBING THEM TO HAVE TO COVER THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT. I'LL QUESTION ABOUT COMPANIES ABILITY TO SELF INSURE BECAUSE TYPICALLY WHEN WE IMPOSE A REQUIREMENT ON COMPANIES WE DO ALLOW THEM. TO CERTIFY THAT THEY HAVE THE ASSETS NECESSARY. TO COVER A LOSS AND IF THAT'S THE CASE BUT WE DON'T REQUIRE THEM TO BUY A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. AND I DIDN'T SEE THAT- THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT. YEAH HI- I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT ALSO BECAUSE WHEN I SERVED ON A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD I. WE DID EXACTLY THAT WE SELF INSURED AND TO A CERTAIN LIMIT AND ANYTHING BEYOND THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY IT YOU KNOW I POLICY. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO LOOK INTO AYE AYE I THINK- WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE. TO SEE LET'S SEE. I INDUSTRY FIRST OR- ANYBODY. NOBODY HAS ACT COME UP WITH ANY SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL UNTIL RECENTLY SO. SO THIS IS SOMETHING AND OTHER EVERY THAT WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO LOOK INTO AS WELL. I'VE SELF INSURANCE AND OTHER OTHER POTENTIAL HERE IS THAT WE SHOULD TOUCH ON. pTHAT WOULD STILL ACCOMPLISH YOUR PURPOSE BECAUSE- IF YOU'RE INTENDING TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES CAN SURVIVE. AND ALSO THE CLAIMS GET PAID IF YOU HAVE A FAIRY FINANCIALLY HEALTHY COMPANY THAT'S WILLING TO MAKE THAT- THAT KIND OF DEMONSTRATION I THINK THAT THAT- YOU KNOW THAT. THERE WOULD STILL ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. I GOTCHA THANK YOU. MR CHAO WOULD YOU I LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND- YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR. GIVING SO MUCH INFORMATION WITHIN SYSTEM SO YOU KNOW SUCH A SUCH A SHORT TIME PERIOD SO. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY THAT.
