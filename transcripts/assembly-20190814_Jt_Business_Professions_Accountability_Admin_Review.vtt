00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:04.702
HAVE A BUDGET OF TWENTY EIGHT

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:05.937
MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT WAS A

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:06.437
REALLY ENVISIONED TO BE

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:07.038
COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:08.239
FOURTEEN. I TOOK HER WAS

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:08.840
SELECTED AS THE VENDOR OUT TO

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:10.241
DO THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND THAT

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:10.775
HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:11.676
ELEVEN. I SO THE FIRST RELEASE

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:12.677
OCCURRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:35:12.743 --> 00:35:13.444
THIRTEEN AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:13.911
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:14.779
CHALLENGES THAT EMERGED IN

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:17.014
THEIR MERCH PRETTY QUICKLY. SO

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:18.583
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:19.617
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THEIR

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:21.652
PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS THAT MADE

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:22.787
IT DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THESE

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.188
BOARDS INTERESTED TO THEIR

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.823
LICENSING ACTIVITIES. THERE

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:26.624
WERE DELAYS THERE ARE

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.593
SUBSTANTIAL COST INCREASES AND

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:29.460
THERE'S A STATE AUDITOR'S

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.195
REPORT THAT OUTLINED A LOT OF

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:31.729
THESE CHALLENGES THAT THE

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:33.965
DEPARTMENT FACED. US A GIVEN

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:35.132
THESE CHALLENGES THE

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.133
ADMINISTRATION AND FROM THE

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.302
LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:41.372
FIFTEEN THAT IT INTENDED TO

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:41.906
CANCEL THE PROJECT. AFTER

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:46.277
RELEASE TO. AND A LOT OF THIS

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:46.911
WAS DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AS

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:47.712
WELL AS THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.113
ACOSTA TOTALED. ABOUT NINETY

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.847
SIX MILLION JUST FOR THAT

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:51.749
RELEASED ONE INTO SO FOR ABOUT

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:52.750
HALF THE PROJECT AT THAT POINT.

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.452
I SO IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:55.119
THE DEPARTMENT DID LAUNCH

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.954
RELEASE TO AN IN GENERAL I

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:58.656
THINK THE- RESPONSE WITH THAT

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:00.591
THAT WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:01.626
RELEASE ONE AND THAT THINGS

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.127
WENT PRETTY WELL THERE. BUT

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.195
THERE IS STILL A NEED REALLY TO

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.731
MEET THAT THE I. T. NEEDS OF

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:08.099
THESE REALLY THREE BOARDS IN

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:09.333
BUREAU SO ABOUT HALF OF THAT

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.768
BOARD OF YOURS IN THE

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:11.903
DEPARTMENT STILL DIDN'T HAVE AN

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:14.171
UPGRADED SYSTEM. SO THE

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.306
LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED IN

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:17.208
GETTING A PLAN FOR THAT. THAT

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:20.278
SORT OF ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:21.579
FOR ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:23.414
THESE ENTITIES AND IF YOU TURN

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:25.850
TO PAGE THREE. WE DISCUSS A

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:28.853
LITTLE BIT THAT PLAN SO

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.590
BASICALLY. I COULD DIRECTION OF

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:37.161
THE LEGISLATURE. IN. THOUSAND

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:37.662
NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:38.930
SUBMITTED A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING

00:36:38.996 --> 00:36:39.997
THE NEEDS OF THESE ENTITIES AND

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:40.598
THIS WAS CALLED THE BUSINESS

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:41.165
MODERNIZATION PLAN. IT WAS

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:42.333
SUBSEQUENTLY UPDATED IN

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.067
DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.235
EIGHTEEN. AND THIS IS REALLY A

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:45.770
VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH FROM

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:47.004
WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:47.605
AND BREEZE DEGREES WAS GIVE ME

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:48.673
THIS ONE SYSTEM IS GOING TO.

00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:49.206
KIND OF MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:51.275
EVERYONE. BUT I THINK IT WAS

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:53.311
SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF A BUT I

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.812
TEND TO TRY TO HAVE THIS. SORT

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:58.282
OF. CATCH ALL. ONE SYSTEM FOR

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.817
EVERYONE THIS WAS THIS NEW

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:00.718
EFFORT IS BUSINESS

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:01.953
MODERNIZATION EFFORT IS REALLY

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.688
HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. I

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:06.357
THINK IT RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.825
THE CHALLENGES THAT BREEZE

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.126
ENCOUNTERED OR SUMMIT

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:09.927
CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED WERE AS

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.762
A RESULT OF. A MAYBE AN

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:13.497
OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF AN IDEA

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:14.999
OF WHAT THESE ENTITY'S WOULD

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:17.468
NEED IN THAT. AND PRACTICE

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:18.636
ACTUALLY. THEY ARE VERY UNIQUE

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.538
AND THEY HAD FRENCH KINDS OF

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:22.206
BUSINESS NEEDS THAT REALLY

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:23.140
NEEDED TO BE EVALUATED AND-

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:26.410
MUCH MORE THOROUGH WAY. AND

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.778
THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY WOULD

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.080
HAVE DIFFERENT ULTIMATE I IS IN

00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:30.915
TERMS OF WHAT THE SOLUTION

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.116
WOULD BE FOR THEM SO MAYBE ONE

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.919
SYSTEM WOULDN'T BE. WOULDN'T BE

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.554
A SOLUTION FOR ALL OF THEM. SO

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:38.289
IF YOU HAVE THAT CONSISTENT

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:41.459
WITH THE FOCUS. BACK TO REVISED

00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:47.264
PLAN AND FOCUS. THAT THIS UNDER

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:53.437
HIS ASIAN PLAN. VISION WARDS IN

00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:54.405
BUREAUS NOT DOING ONE

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:55.506
IMPLEMENTATION ALTOGETHER BUT

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:56.741
REALLY MOVING MORE AT THEIR OWN

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:57.675
TIMELINE. ON THEIR LEVEL OF

00:37:57.742 --> 00:37:59.210
READINESS AND ALSO POTENTIALLY

00:37:59.276 --> 00:37:59.810
IMPLEMENTING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:00.778
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE PRE

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:02.313
SYSTEM THAT COVERS EVERYONE.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.914
SOME OF THESE ENTITIES YOU

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:04.515
MIGHT BE ON DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:06.450
AND IN FACT WILL HAVE THAT.

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:07.018
FREE SYSTEM WHICH WILL COVER

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.419
RELEASED ONE INTO THE BEER CANS

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:09.053
CONTROL HAS A DIFFERENT SYSTEM.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.187
AND IT WORKS ACTING BAD THE

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:11.122
RELEASE THREE ENTITIES TO HAVE

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:12.189
AT LEAST ONE OTHER SYSTEM SO

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:15.326
IT'LL BE. A FEW DIFFERENT

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:15.960
SYSTEMS IN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:19.530
DEPARTMENT. SO THERE ARE REALLY

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:21.465
VERY LEVELS OF PROGRESS TO DATE

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:22.533
FOR THOSE RELEASED THREE BOARDS

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.300
IN YOUR THINKING GO HERE

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:23.934
PROBABLY MORE ABOUT THIS COMING

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:27.304
UP. BUT. SEVEN TO DATE HAVE

00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:28.739
COMPLETED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:29.573
AND THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.676
ACTUALLY MAPPING WHAT THEIR

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:32.143
BUSINESS PROCESSES ARE

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:33.477
CURRENTLY AND WHAT THEY SHOULD

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:36.113
BE. AND FOR HAVE COMPLETED

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.148
THEIR ANALYSES OF PROJECT

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:39.283
ALTERNATIVES AND REALLY HAVE

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.285
PROPOSED A SORT OF KIND OF

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:42.153
SOLUTION THAT THEY WANT TO

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.055
UNDERTAKE AND THAT'S BASICALLY

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:45.256
PHASE TWO OF THE PROJECT

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:47.692
APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:48.292
WHICH I THINK YOU'LL ALSO HEAR

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:53.197
ABOUT. SHORTLY. SO ALSO IT'S

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:53.764
DONE THE FIGURE ON PAGE FOR

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:54.932
THESE ENTITIES AS TO HAVE

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.233
DIFFERENT ESTIMATED COMPLETION

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.935
DATE SO THAT FIGURE SHOWS. ON

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.537
THEM THE DEPARTMENT'S MOST

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:01.539
RECENT ESTIMATES OF WHEN THESE

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.007
VARIOUS PORTS IN EUROS WILL

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.208
ACTUALLY BE FULLY TRANSITIONS

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.810
THEIR NEW SYSTEMS SEE SEE THAT

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:09.113
A NUMBER WILL BE. WILL BE IN

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.414
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:11.215
TWENTY TWO BUT THEY EXTEND ALL

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:12.583
THE WAY OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:13.617
FIVE SO IT'LL BE SEVERAL YEARS

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:17.455
BEFORE REALLY THE WHOLE

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:18.022
DEPARTMENT HAS. UPGRADED IT

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:21.892
SYSTEMS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.260
FIVE WE JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:23.861
THE RECENT BUDGET ACTION SO IN

00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:25.629
THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET.

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:27.131
THERE WERE AND SIX DIFFERENT

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.599
ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE BUDGET

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.468
AUGMENTATIONS TO HELP THEM MOVE

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:31.736
FORWARD FORWARD WITH THEIR

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:34.004
PROJECTS RELATES TO THE EARLY

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:34.605
IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR THEIR

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:37.441
PROJECTS. TO THESE ENTITIES ARE

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:39.110
REALLY A DIFFERENCE SERVE EARLY

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.878
RELATIVELY EARLY STAGES SOME OF

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:41.812
THEM ARE STILL DOING A BUSINESS

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.714
PROCESS EVALUATION SOME OF THEM

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:45.916
HAVE COMPLETED PHASE TWO. OF

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:50.221
THE STATE TO GET PROCESS. STAGE

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:51.388
TWO BUT THEY'RE ALL STILL

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:51.889
REFINING THE TOTAL COST

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:53.190
ESTIMATES OF SOME OF THEM HAVE

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:53.824
SOME PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATES

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:54.592
BUT NOT THE TOTAL COST

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:56.093
ESTIMATES OF THIS FIVE POINT

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.994
FIVE MILLION. IS WHAT WAS

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:58.896
PROVIDED JUST FOR NINETEEN

00:39:58.963 --> 00:39:59.730
TWENTY AND A ONE TIME BASIS BUT

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:01.398
THE FULL PROJECT COSTS AFTER

00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:02.466
THESE ENTITIES HAVEN'T BEEN

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.935
FULLY ACCESS AT THIS POINT. I

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.438
SOME HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:07.972

THAT WAS THE- IDEAS OF CREATING

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:18.295
A PLAN. AND THE GOALS WERE. ONE

UNDETERMINED BUDGET OF COURSE I

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.427
THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:19.495
THE REASON AND I WON'T GET TOO

THE INTEGRATION INTO THAT

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:56.332
ECOSYSTEM SO IT TALKS TO BRIEF

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:57.634
SO APPROXIMATE CAN. PLATFORM

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.968

WE DON'T MAKE SIDE LOAD NEW

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.145
SYSTEM OKAY WE MAKE AN ENTIRE A

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:11.147
COMMUNITY OF SYSTEM THAT IN

HALF MILLION THAT WAS IN THIS

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:39.075
YEAR'S BUDGET. I RECOGNIZE THAT

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:41.411

THEY BE FACED WITH. IS A HARD

00:59:58.795 --> 00:59:59.896
QUESTION TO SEE IF I CAN ADD AS

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:01.564
BEST I CAN. SO WE'LL TAKE A

TWENTY MILLION ENDS UP

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.035
THREEFOLD OF THAT WE STILL

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.471

CONTRACTS BEING CRAFT IN A

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.440

LESS ON THE HOOK FOR.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:37.693
UNEXPECTED I'M SO I'M SO GLAD

SAY THE CONTRACT STRUCTURE THE

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:43.633
IN. CONTRACT STRUCTURE. IS TO

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:44.801

CANNABIS PROJECT OKAY AND IT

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.037
WAS A CONTRACT STRUCTURE. THAT

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.640

THE CONTRACT IS SUCH THAT FOR

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.360
IT FOLLOWS THE AN AGILE

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:13.796
APPROACH. SO WHAT I MEAN BY

INTENDED STRUCTURE IS WAY MORE

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:36.285

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.104
NOT TO EVEN HAVE KIND A

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.939
BALLPARK FIGURE. ON HOW MUCH IS

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.775
THIS GOING TO COST AND- I DON'T

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:20.376
KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE COME

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:21.677
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT I

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:23.612
CAN GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S NOT A

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:24.246
COMPANY IN THE WORLD. WHERE YOU

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:27.116
CAN SAY. I'LL WE GOT SAID. AND

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.318
PROJECTS AND WE'RE JUST GONNA

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:30.953
KEEP THE MALL RUNNING WE'RE NOT

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.921
EXACTLY SURE HOW MUCH THEY'RE

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:34.256
GONNA COST BED. JUST TRUST US

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.625
TO KEEP DOING THIS FOR SIX MORE

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:37.727
YEARS THAT. REALLY FEELS CRAZY

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.729
TO ME. AND I DO WANT TO FIGURE

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:42.398
OUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO. GET A

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.065
BETTER HANDLE ON HOW MUCH THIS

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:45.768
IS GOING TO COST AND- AND PUSH

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.703
FOR THAT CLARITY. AND SECOND. I

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.238
WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.140
ON WHAT WOULD IT TAKE. TO TURN

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.675
THE STUFF AROUND IN YOUR TWO

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.243
YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX YEARS

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.544
BECAUSE I SHARE. YOU MISTER

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:57.146
GLORIA POINTED OUT. PROJECTED

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:59.348
TIMELINE. IT'S BUSINESS

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:01.384
REQUIREMENTS CHANGE THE WORLD

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:04.320
CHANGES IN SIX YEARS. MULTI

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:04.954
MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS ARE

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.358
FOUNDED BELT SOLD SIX YEARS

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:09.925
THIS SEEMS REALLY REALLY TOO

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:10.926
LONG FOR ME TO A- IT'S JUST TO

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.896
TAKE A PLEA. PROCESS RE

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.498
ENGINEERING PROJECT BOB CHECK

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:16.565
IS THOSE ARE TWO QUESTIONS WHAT

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:17.733
WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU GUYS TO

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.935
GET A BETTER IDEA OF AN OVERALL

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.370
BUDGET AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:25.007
TO DELIVER THIS PROJECT IN A

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:25.608
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY IN A

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:28.744
MUCH SHORTER. AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:32.181
TO GET TAKE TO GET TO A MORE

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:33.482
CONCRETE BUDGET FOR THE

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:37.386
ENTIRETY OF THE PROCESS. I'M

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:42.224
GOING TO SAY THAT. IT WOULD

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:44.126
TAKE A LOT OF GOOD ESTIMATES

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:46.462
AND BASS AND IT WE WOULD WE

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:48.497
WOULD HAVE TO BASE IT ON OUR

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:52.735
EXPERIENCE WITH CANNABIS AND

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:53.736
PERHAPS THE FIRST COHORT TO GET

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:56.972
TO. A CONCRETE FOR THE ENTIRETY

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.741
FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROJECT

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.876
AND I EVEN HEDGING SAYING THAT

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:03.646
ONLY BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCES

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:06.315
THAT ARE VERY VERY APPARENT IN

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.884
OUR BOARDS IN BUREAUS THE SIZES

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.419
THE COMPLEXITIES THE BUSINESS

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:14.356
REQUIREMENTS. IT CETERA ARE SO

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.358
VARIED ALONG A SPECTRUM OF

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:19.261
EVERYTHING THAT WEEK AND THAT

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.664
COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF THAT TO.

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:23.566
PUT THE PUT EACH IN A BOX AND

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:24.767
COME UP WITH THAT A GOOD

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.869
ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT I WOULD

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:27.870
FEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE WAY

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.472
THAT NUMBER WOULD BE OFF OF HIM

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.640
HOWEVER ACADEMICALLY I THINK

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:32.475
IT'S POSSIBLE TO COME UP WITH

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:33.776
THE NEXT ESTIMATE BASED ON A

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:37.313
LOT OF COBB YACHTS AND- THAT'S

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:41.517
AND- ASSUMPTIONS. SOME PM AT

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:43.853
MID MATCH UP IN IN. I THINK WE

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:44.420
NEED TO TAKE THIS BACK AND I

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:45.020
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION NIGHT

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:45.988
WHAT WILL COMMIT TO GETTING

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.656
BACK TO YOU I THINK. THE

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:48.257
CONCERN IS THAT AT THIS POINT.

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:49.425
IF PUSH FOR IT ESTIMATES WE

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:53.596
WOULD GIVE. AND ESTIMATE THAT

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.631
WE WOULD HOPE TO UNDERSTOOD

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.199
RIGHT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GO

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.767
OVER BUDGET RIGHT SO WE WOULD

01:08:58.834 --> 01:08:59.869
WHATEVER ESTIMATE WE DEVELOPED

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:02.638
AND- ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA WAS

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:03.639
JUST PUSHING US TO GET A GREAT

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.907
DEAL WITH THE VENDORS SO I KIND

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:05.741
OF DON'T WANT TO SEND A PRICE

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.143
SIGNAL IT'S BIGGER THAN WE

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:08.978
THINK WE CAN DELIVER GREAT SO

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:10.279
IT PUTS US IN A BOX SEAT RIGHT

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.781
IF. IF WE ESTABLISH AN OVERALL

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:13.949
BUDGET THAT'S THE OUTSIDE

01:09:14.016 --> 01:09:16.285
BOUNDARY OF WHAT WE MIGHT SPEND

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:16.919
AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO GET A

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.788
BETTER DEAL FROM THE VENDORS IT

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.423
PUTS US IN A IN A DIFFICULT BOX

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.859
THIS ALSO RELATES TO ACCOMPANY

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:26.128
APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:28.364
FINANCE HOW THE WHOLE STATE

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.565
BUDGET THESE THINGS THAT'S A

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:32.368
LITTLE BEYOND MY REVENGE ISN'T.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:36.839
SO WHAT. SAID TAKING A CALL.

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:41.677
BACK IN A GETTING BACK. THERE.

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:43.412
IT'S GOING TO ADD ONE ONE OTHER

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.013
LITTLE THING WHICH MIGHT MIGHT

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:45.147
HELP A LITTLE BIT. SEEMS LIKE

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:46.248
PART OF THE CHALLENGES. IS SORT

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:47.283
OF THIS PROJECT REAL LIFE CYCLE

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.150
PROCESS WHICH WAS PUT IN PLACE

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:48.717
FOR. YOU TO PROVIDE A REASON

01:09:48.784 --> 01:09:49.218
FOR A LOT OF CHALLENGES

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:49.785
ASSOCIATE WITH THE PREVIOUS

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.720
PROCESS. BUT AS I UNDERSTAND

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.122
THAT USED TO ONE OF THE- PIECES

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:55.391
OF THAT PROCESS IS. IS THAT OF.

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:56.192
THROUGH THAT THAT PROJECT

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:58.160
APPROVAL ICICLE PROCESS. THAT

01:09:58.227 --> 01:09:59.562
THE COSTS ARE REFINED INTO

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:01.463
THERE'S SORT OF AN- BY AT STAGE

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.565
TWO THEY HAVE THESE. ROUGH

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:03.098
ESTIMATES ASSEMBLY FOLKS

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.366
SOMEBODY'S ENTITIES ACTUALLY DO

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.935
HAVE YOU KNOW ROUGH ESTIMATES I

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:08.437
THINK A LOT OF MORE AROUND LIKE

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:09.438
MAYBE FOUR MILLION. EACH FOR

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:10.739
EACH THESE ENTITIES. SERVE IN

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:11.407
THAT BALLPARK ALTHOUGH IT COULD

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:13.175
VERY BRIGHT. BUT THAT'S A

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.877
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE AND THAT

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.478
WILL WILL CHANGE OVER TIME

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:19.315
FINANCIALLY. AND SO THAT'S SORT

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.549
OF A STAGE TO BUT THEY DON'T

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:22.484
REALLY REFINE THOSE ESTIMATES

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.186
AND TELL ANSWER OF ACTUALLY

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.088
HAVE A FULL. PROJECT BUDGET

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.189
INTO REALLY THAT PROJECT

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.657
APPROVAL EXCEPT THE PROCESS IS

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:29.658
MORE TOWARD. THE END OF

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:32.595
COMPLETION. AND I THINK. THAT

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.864
IS IT SO THAT IT. IS A

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:39.668
REALISTIC. BOB PROJECT BUDGET

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:47.876
AND- THAT. IS SOMETHING WE. CAN

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:48.444
REALLY HOLD. ACCOUNTABLE AND

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:53.449
WHAT HAVE. YOU. THROUGHOUT THE

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:59.722
LIFE WHEN SHOULD YOU. ENGINE IS

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.090
YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:02.358
PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL'S

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.026
LIKE WE LIKE THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.160
SIGNED NINETEEN TWENTY IN THE

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:07.329
BUDGET FOR OKAY YEAH CAN YOU

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:09.531
PLEASE APPROVE THIS FIRST YEAR

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.300
OF FINDING RIGHT BUT AT THAT

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:12.401
POINT IS THE FIRST YOU'RE FUNNY

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:13.702
BUT- THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:14.470
REALLY KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:17.006
PROJECT AS- THERE'S NO YEAH AND

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:19.141
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD SO WE

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.175
ACTUALLY HAD SOME

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:22.311
RECOMMENDATIONS AND I THINK

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:22.811
THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:24.580
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND WE

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:25.314
HAD SOME PREDICTIONS FOR SOME

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.448
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ON THOSE.

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:27.850
ULTIMATELY WHAT INCLUDED BUT IN

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.752
THE BUDGET BUT I THINK THERE'S

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:30.319
A KIND OF THINGS LEGISLATURE

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:32.488
MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:35.791
KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE HAVE

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.526
THAT OVERSTAFFED. WE FIGURE OUT

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:38.127
HOW TO HAVE FUN THOSE INITIAL

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:43.098
ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO HOW DO WE

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.400
SORT OF NOT FIND MORE THAN WE

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.969
NEED TO WITHOUT A CLEAR THE ON

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:53.776
HOW MUCH THE PROJECT IS GOING.

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:54.309
TO COST AND WHETHER THAT'S

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:54.910
WORTH IT. AND SO THOSE ARE THE

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:58.914
TOP. THE LIGHT SAYS IT.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:04.687
INSTRUCT. A LITTLE BIT AS WELL

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:05.220
THANKS A THAT SPAHN AND AT

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:07.056
MISMATCH HADDOCK. BUT I HAVE A

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:07.656
FOLLOW UP ON THAT CONCEPT SO I

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:08.290
COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:08.791
AS A MATTER OF STANDARD

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.092
PRACTICE IN OUR MOST SIZABLE

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:10.693
PROJECTS PARTICULARLY AROUND

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:12.161
TECH IMPLEMENTATION OR BUILDING

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.362
STRUCTURES WE HAD A TWO PART

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:14.697
OUR FEE PROCESS AS OF THE FIRST

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:15.397
PART WAS SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:16.598
SCOPING OF THE PROJECT. AND AN

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:17.232
ESTIMATE WHICH COULD EVEN BE AS

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:17.800
I UNDERSTAND NOT WANTING TO

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:18.400
SIGNAL TO THE BIDDING MARKET

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.135
RIGHT THAT THAT THIS IS WHAT

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:20.869
YOUR RANGE IS BUT TOOK THAT

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.504
COULD BE USED AS AN INTERNAL.

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.573
KIND OF GUIDE POST IF YOU WILL

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.542
ESPECIALLY IN THESE MAJOR MULTI

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.844
MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. IS THAT

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:32.014
A PRACTICE THAT. OCCURS NOW IS

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:32.614
AT A PRACTICE THAT YOU WOULD

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.550
BE. OPEN TO BECAUSE AGAIN ANY

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:35.951
GUARD RAILS THAT WE CAN SET IN

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.419
PLACE AROUND HOW WE'RE USING

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:39.021
THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. TO THE TO

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.589
THE BEST A FACT AND NOT KIND OF

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.057
WRITING THIS OPEN ENDED CHECK I

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:44.493
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.060
THE COMMITTEES PRESENT HERE

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.629
TODAY TO TRY TO ESTABLISH. I

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:48.797
THINK THIS STRUCTURE THAT STAGE

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.532
GATE STRUCTURE FOR THE PROJECT

01:12:50.599 --> 01:12:51.800

VALLEY IS THAT TECH CHANGES SO

01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:20.020
RAPIDLY SO FOR THE

THERE STATUTORY OR STRUCTURAL

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:41.041
BARRIERS THAT PREVENT A MORE

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:42.976
RAPID IMPLEMENTATION THAT WE

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:31.825
CONTRACTS LEVERAGED PROCUREMENT

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:33.961
CONTRACTS THAT EXIST THAT ALLOW

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:36.230
DEPARTMENTS LIKE MINE LIKE. THE

01:40:36.296 --> 01:40:40.467
CA TO MORE EASILY PROCURE OF

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:42.002
COMMODITIES UNDER THESE

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.637
LEVERAGED PROCUREMENT I THINK

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.339
THE EXPANSION OF THAT OR OR

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:46.407
JUST THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:49.109
IN. THE AREAS OF TECHNOLOGIES

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:51.245
THAT ARE CUTTING EDGE MOST

01:40:51.311 --> 01:40:53.247
RELEVANT MOST IMPACTFUL TO A

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:54.882
STATE GOVERNMENT MAKES A LOT OF

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:58.152
SENSE I KNOW THAT IF I CAN

01:40:58.218 --> 01:40:59.887
PURCHASE SOMETHING OFF OF. FROM

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:00.921
ONE OF THOSE PROCUREMENT

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:04.391
METHODOLOGIES IT'S- A LOT

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:06.593
QUICKER THAN IF I HAD TO GO AND

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.128
A DIFFERENT WAY. SO THAT'S THE

01:41:08.195 --> 01:41:08.862
FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:11.598
MIND THE SECOND I WILL SAY THIS

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:13.066
AT ALL IN AND MAKE IT WITH A

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:15.102
NEGATIVE CONNOTATION. BUT TO

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:16.637
TALK STE THE TIME LINES AS A

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:18.705
WHOLE AND THE ABILITY TO BE AS

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:22.643
AGILE AND NIMBLE AS POSSIBLE.

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:27.648
WE STILL. BUT WORK WITHIN.

01:41:27.714 --> 01:41:29.049
STRUCTURES THAT EXIST THE LA

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.684
SPOKE TO THE BUDGET CYCLE AND

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:31.718
IT'S OF OVERLAY ON TECH

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:32.953
PROJECTS AND THE APPROVAL OF

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.656
TECH PROJECTS. SO WE HAVE THAT

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:37.858
TO WORK WITH AND WE ALSO HAVE

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.092
THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:43.263
WHICH- I AS SOMEBODY WHO IS ON

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:45.199
THE RECEIVING END OF THE

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:47.234
OVERSIGHT I'D RATHER SEE

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:49.069
OVERSIGHT. YOU KNOW AS LEAN AS

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:50.904
POSSIBLE HOWEVER THE REALITY IN

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.372
IT SINCE THE PROJECT APPROVAL I

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:55.008
CYCLE HAS COME ABOUT IN TWO

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:55.509
THOUSAND THIRTEEN IN MY

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:57.978
EXPERIENCE WITH IT IT HAS PUT

01:41:58.045 --> 01:41:58.612
IT HAS THEY HAVE PARTNERED WITH

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:02.115
US. TO MUCH MORE THOROUGH AND

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:04.051
SUPERIOR AND PRODUCTS AND WHEN

01:42:04.117 --> 01:42:05.752
I SAY THAT NOT NECESSARILY JUST

01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:06.854
THE END PRODUCT OF THE

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.522
IMPLEMENTATION BUT THE PLANNING

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:09.656
ARTIFACTS THE PROJECT

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:11.859
ARTIFACTS. AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:15.162
WE HAVE. MR WHARTON SPOKE ABOUT

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:19.399
SCOPE COST SCHEDULE AND QUALITY

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:20.834
AND THAT'S THE LAST ONE IS ONE

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:23.203
THAT IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN SO THAT

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:25.005
PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PUT

01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:27.708
EYES ON. PUT PUT MULTIPLE EYES

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:30.811
ON THAT PROCESS AND I SEE THINK

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:33.814
WE FIT WE'VE SEEN THAT SO. THAT

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:34.848
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SIDE STEP

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:35.749
TO YOUR QUESTION BUT THE THINGS

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.985
THAT BECAUSE THAT'S A BIT OF A

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:38.886
LINK TO YOUR PROBABLY IF YOUR

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:41.989
TIME ARE. THOSE TO THOSE ITEMS

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.457
BUT AGAIN NOT SAYING THAT IT'S

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:43.991
A NEGATIVE THING BECAUSE I

01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:46.560
FOUND JUST A TON OF VALUE BEING

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.028
ON THE OVERSIGHT END OF THAT

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:49.897
PROCESS SINCE IT'S COME OUT AND

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:51.164
THEY REFINED IT OVER. THE LAST

01:42:51.231 --> 01:42:53.233
FEW YEARS. TO ROUGH OUT SOME

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.101
EDGES AND JUST BRING MORE

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:58.038
RELEVANT INSIDE AND FEEDBACK TO

01:42:58.105 --> 01:43:01.208
THAT PROCESS. AND WE'RE. IN THE

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:02.075
BUSINESS MODERNIZATION WERE

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:06.413
VERY CLOSE PARTNERS WITH CDT.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:06.880
TO THE BENEFIT OF THE

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:07.447
DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:14.187
DEFINITELY. IF I A MAJOR SAID I

01:43:14.254 --> 01:43:16.990
MY UNDERSTANDING IS OUR NEW

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:19.359
SYSTEM WILL BE ADAPTABLE AND

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:21.895
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY COULD

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:25.032
ESSENTIALLY PLUG AND TO SO WE

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:26.567
CAN ADVANCE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY

01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:28.201
THAT THAT'LL BE THE CAPABILITY

01:43:28.268 --> 01:43:30.470
GOING FORWARD SO THIS ISN'T

01:43:30.537 --> 01:43:32.673
GOING TO BE OBSOLETE. BY THE

01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:35.075
TIME WE YEAH WE PROCURING AND

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:38.612
GET IT IMPLEMENTED IT'S GOING

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:42.049
TO BE ON TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN.

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:43.684
EXPAND YES THANK YOU AND THAT

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:44.318
WAS THE SECOND PART QUESTION I

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:47.588
APOLOGIZE I THINK IN CHOOSING.

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:49.523
TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THIS PROCESS

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:50.958
IN ORDER TO FUTURE PROOF WHICH

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:52.326
IS KIND OF YOUR QUESTION HOW DO

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:52.993
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.062
SPEND A DOLLAR TODAY AND ITS

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:57.531
ITS VALUE LIST TOMORROW WE DO

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.766
THAT WE ATTEMPT TO DO THAT

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:00.634
BASED ON THE AVAILABLE

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:02.736
TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY.

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:04.705
HOW MUCH OF IT IS ADAPTABLE HOW

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:07.207
QUICK TO MARKET OUR CHANGES

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:09.443
HUGELY IMPORTANT AND I THINK

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:10.811
WAIT A PART IN IT IN A

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:12.913
TECHNOLOGICAL ARC THAT ALLOWS

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.916
US WITH PLENTY OF TECHNOLOGIES

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:17.951
PLATFORMS THAT EXISTS TODAY A

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:20.087
LOT OF HAS A SERVICE WE MAY BE

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:21.221
COULD BE MAY HAVE HEARD OF

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:24.024
SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE PLATFORM

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:25.692
AS A SERVICE. CLOUD CLOUD

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:27.861
APPLICATIONS THAT WERE AT WERE

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:30.230
IN AN ARC IN TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:32.299
MAY THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:33.734
CONFIDENT MAY ALLOW US TO

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.769
CHOOSE A TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL

01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:38.839
MAKE US AS FUTURE PROOF AS IS

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:42.442
REASONABLE SO THAT WE CAN. WE

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:45.045
CAN VALUE THE IT INVESTMENT FOR

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.748
YEARS BUT ALSO WHEN IT'S TIME

01:44:47.814 --> 01:44:50.350
TO CHANGE IT WAS TIME TO ADAPT

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:50.951
WERE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH AS

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:53.954
LITTLE DISRUPTION AS POSSIBLE.

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:54.488
THE ECO SYSTEM IDEA THAT I

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:59.926
BROUGHT UP EARLIER. WHAT HE

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:01.028
JUST EXPLAINS WHAT I WAS TRYING

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:01.528
TO EXPLAIN EARLIER IN MY

01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:02.529
PRESENTATION IS JUST THAT THAT

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:03.096
ADAPTABILITY AND PLUGGING IN

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:04.431
THESE SERVICES AND WE DON'T

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:05.599
NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO THAT. AT

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:06.967
ON THE FRONT END BUT BUT WILL

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:08.869
HAVE THAT CAPABILITY TO ADAPT

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:12.939
AND TO ADD ON GOING FORWARD SO

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:13.540
TO ME THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:17.177
I'M EXCITED ABOUT. CORRECT ME

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:18.278
FOR MODEST BUT BREEZE HAS THE

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:18.812
CAPABILITY RIGHT NOW TO BE

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:19.513
ADAPTABLE SO WHEN WE ARE

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:21.248
LOOKING AT. OUR INSPECTIONS AND

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:22.282
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:22.983
PAPERWORK TAKE UP OUR

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:24.451
INSPECTORS TO DO WE ACTUALLY

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.886
HAD DECENT SEEN COME OUT AND DO

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:27.087
A RIGHT ON INSPECTIONS AND

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.488
WATCH THE PROCESS AND THEN WE

01:45:28.555 --> 01:45:31.058
CAN DISCUSS. THE BEST WAYS TO

01:45:31.124 --> 01:45:32.159
IMPROVE THAT PROCESS BY

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:34.027
BUILDING ON TO BREEZE ARE

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.228
POTENTIALLY GET OTHER SOFTWARE

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.064
THAT WORKS WITH BREEZE. SO I

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:40.367
DON'T THINK THAT BREEZE ITSELF

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:40.934
IS OBSOLETE BECAUSE IT IS A

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:44.705
DOCTOR PULLED CORRECT. SHE

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:45.605
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK THE

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:47.441
IDEA OF THIS ECO SYSTEM THAT I

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.109
KEEP SPEAKING ABOUT. PLUGS

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:51.078
BREEZE AND THE CANNABIS

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:54.881
PLATFORM INTO THAT. ENVIRONMENT

01:45:54.948 --> 01:45:58.719
FOR FOLKS TO USE TO USE AND TO

01:45:58.785 --> 01:45:59.986
ADD ON TO BOLT ON TWO DIFFERENT

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:01.655
FUNCTIONALITIES. ONE OF THE

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:03.490
THINGS THAT WE'VE WE FOUND

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:04.791
GENERALLY THE TECHNOLOGIST

01:46:04.858 --> 01:46:06.860
ACROSS MY CAREER. IS THAT

01:46:06.927 --> 01:46:08.829
NGUYEN AND IT WOULDN'T AGENCY A

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:11.231
COMPANY INVEST A LOT IN A

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:13.300
PLATFORM OF SOME SORT. THEY

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:14.501
ATTEMPT TO SHOVE EVERY

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:16.536
POTENTIAL BUSINESS OP BUSINESS

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.004
PROCESS INTO THAT SYSTEM

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:19.706
BECAUSE THEY- SPENT A INVESTED

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:21.608
IN IT. AND SOMETIMES A REALITY

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:24.044
IS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ARE THE-

01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:26.913
ANSWER TO. A PROVIDING A

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.849
HOLISTIC OPERATIONAL DOES IT

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.317
OPERATED OPERATIONAL IS ATION

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:32.486
OF YOUR PROCESSES. SO BREEZE

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:34.020
FITS RIGHT INTO THE ECOSYSTEM

01:46:34.087 --> 01:46:35.922
TALKS TO. X. Y. AND Z. TO

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:38.692
ACHIEVE AN OVERALL OPERATION

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:40.427
FOR THE BOARD OF. INSERT BOARD

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:44.364
HERE. PHARMACY VET MED

01:46:44.431 --> 01:46:50.337
CHIROPRACTORS ETCETERA. SHOULD

01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:51.271
BROUGHT THAT ROUGH DRAFT THAT

01:46:51.338 --> 01:46:52.672
YOU DID FOR ME BECAUSE IT HE

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:53.907
EXPLAINED IT SO WELL AND THAT

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:54.541
YOU JUST AS LITTLE DRAWING OUT

01:46:54.608 --> 01:46:56.176
OF PAPER AND IT WAS EASILY

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:57.244
UNDERSTANDABLE AND I GET FOR ME

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.744
WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:58.845
TECHNOLOGY. I KNEW WHAT HE WAS

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:01.481
TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT WE COULD

01:47:01.548 --> 01:47:02.048
DO AND SO IT MADE ME EXCITED

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:05.152
ABOUT THE PROCESS. IT'S GOOD

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:06.286
YEAH IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.522
EFFECTIVE. PARTNERSHIPS WE'RE

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:09.122
TACKLING SOME OF THESE REALLY

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:13.093
HARD. BAKE AT ISSUES SUCH AND

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.261
THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR IN FROM

01:47:14.327 --> 01:47:15.428
STARTED REPORT ONE OF THE

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:16.363
THINGS I'VE BEEN REALLY

01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:18.031
IMPRESSED WITH THIS THE

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:18.932
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:22.602
DEPARTMENT AND CD T. AND THE

01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:25.238
BUREAU OF AUDITS AND OUR AGENCY

01:47:25.305 --> 01:47:26.740
BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:28.441
HOUSING I MEAN EVERYBODY IS

01:47:28.508 --> 01:47:31.178
ENGAGING AND- PARTICIPATING IN

01:47:31.244 --> 01:47:32.946
THIS PROCESS SO WE ALL NOW

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:34.447
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WHEN AND

01:47:34.514 --> 01:47:37.818
THERE WON'T BE ANY SURPRISES

01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:38.351
FOR ANYBODY IT'S REALLY A

THINKING ABOUT THIS I IN IN

01:52:13.526 --> 01:52:14.527
TERMS OF SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:52:14.594 --> 01:52:16.096
EVOLVE OVER TIME AND THAT THAT

01:52:16.162 --> 01:52:18.531
