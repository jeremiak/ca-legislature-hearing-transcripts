ALREADY WILL PUT CAN ON CALL- SIMPLY MEMBERS STONE IS BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE- AB TWO SIX ZERO ARE YOU PREPARED YES YOU ARE I AM THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND SENATORS THIS BILL IS A BILL THAT IS TRYING TO CLOSE SOME OF THE GAPS WITHIN. THE WAY CHILDREN WHO ARE ABUSED AND NEGLECTED OR HANDLE IN OUR SYSTEM AND OFTENTIMES. IT DEPENDENCY SYSTEM INTERESTING ENOUGH WANTS TO SEND THEM TO PROBATE TO CREATE THE GUARDIANSHIP THEN THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT OR THAT THOSE CHILDREN THAT. DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. UNDER THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. ANY SPECIAL INCLUDING WHEN THEY BECOME. OR WOULD OTHERWISE BE NON MINOR DEPENDENTS AGE OUT ESSENTIALLY OF THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM THERE THAT PRECLUDED FROM ALL OF THE BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER IT'S HOUSING OR MONEY SUPPORT OR OTHERS THAT. THAT THEY CAN GET IN THAT SYSTEM. AND THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THEM WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ENSURE THAT THEIR SUCCESS SO WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING. IS IN CLARIFYING THAT EVEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS THAT THE CASES REFERRED TO PROBATE TO CREATE A GUARDIANSHIP THEIR- AT THE DEPENDENCY COURT DOES NOT LOSE JURISDICTION. THEY CAN STILL OPEN A CASE THEY CAN STILL. PROTECT THAT CHILD TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO PROTECT THEM AND- THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. OFTENTIMES A SOCIAL WORKER IN THESE CASES THAT IS MAKING A RECOMMENDATION TO PROBATE. WILL DECLINE TO WANT TO HAVE THAT CASE FILED. WE WANTED THE PROBATE JUDGE TO LOOK AT THAT CASE LOOK AT WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD. AND MAKING APPROPRIATE REFERRALS THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. THIS IS BEEN A BILL THAT'S GONE THROUGH SMOOTHLY UP TO THIS POINT. AND IT'S NOW GARNER SOME OPPOSITION. FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS AND- FRANKLY. I TAKE THEIR POINTS IN THEIR POINTS OR- ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT ESPECIALLY QUEER KIDS HAVE IN THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. AND THEY'RE NOT WRONG IN. INTERPRETING THOSE CHALLENGES IN IN AND ASKING FOR SOME HELP BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT THIS BILL. AND THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AROUND THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. DOES CONTINUE TO WORK IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M VERY HEARTENED BY. HISTHE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL THEY WERE NOT WORKING ON THAT SPENDS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND EXPAND THE CAPACITY. FOR USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THE GOAL ALWAYS IS TO NOT HAVE TO SEND KIDS TO THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM FRANKLY WERE THE DELINQUENCY SYSTEM IF WE CAN HELP IT. AND THAT'S WE DO THAT BY PROVIDING SERVICES THOSE KIDS UP FRONT. AND EARLY ON. A LOT OF COUNTIES HAVE WHAT THEY CALL A DIFFERENCE RESPONSE. PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE DEALING WITH FAMILIES BEFORE THERE'S GOING TO BE NEED TO REMOVE A CHILD. THAT'S THE BEST OUTCOME AND I THINK. THAT'S WHAT THE OPPOSITION'S REALLY POINTING TO OR BETTER OUTCOMES FOR KIDS HAPPEN IF WE NEVER HAVE TO BRING THEM. INTOA SYSTEM THAT DOES PROVE TO BE DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF THE KIDS THAT ENTER INTO IT. BUT THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT DECISIONS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM ARE BEING MADE TO APPROPRIATELY. ABOUT THAT CHILD. AND THAT THEY WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. EVEN AS WE WORK TO IMPROVE THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. AND GET THOSE BENEFITS LONG TERM AND NOT UNNECESSARILY EXCLUDED FROM THINGS I CAN GAP IN OTHERS. WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE SOME LEG UP AS THEY AGE OUT OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. MAYBE THERE'S SOME CLARIFICATIONS ARE THINGS BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOT. THIS BILL'S NOT FIXING OVERALL THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM EVEN WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGE THEY NEED TO BE MADE WHAT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO IS ENSURE THAT. THAT THE PROBATE COURTS OUR THIRD PERFECTED LEE INSURING THAT REFERRALS TO DEPENDENCY. CAN HAPPEN WHEN THEY NEED TO HAPPEN SO RIGHT WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I.

WOULDN'T A WITNESS NO IF BOTH PARTIES CAN ATTEST TO THEIR DESIRE TO BE ARRIED OR HELP COMBAT FRAUD OR IF SOMEBODY'S BEING COERCED INTO THE MARRIAGE HAVING THE WITNESS WOULD CERTAINLY HELP WITH THAT. AS IT GOES IN THE SECOND ONE HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT SOMEBODY'S NOT- UNDER DURESS IN IN BEING PUSHED INTO THIS SITUATION. AND- I HAD A PEANUT GALLERY OVER HERE. IF THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CRUX OF IT WE APPRECIATE THE HELP FROM THE OTHER SENATORS RIGHT- BUT- IF WE COULD ASK THAT CONVERSATIONS. BE EITHER IN THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER SO SENATOR JONES IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK HIS QUESTIONS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION JUST A GREAT SUMMER AS I GOT THERE OKAY HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT BOTH INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA. PLEASE ADDRESS THE WITNESS SITUATION AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ONE OR BOTH PARTIES ARE NOT CONSENT ERROR ACTUALLY CONSENTING TO THE MARRIAGE AND NOT. BEING COERCED INTO THIS SITUATION. THANK YOU MR CHAIR IS SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BABIES I UNDERSTAND MR CARAMANDI IS ON THE LINE SO- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT PLEASE GO AHEAD OR IF YOU PREFER TO DEFER TO MISTER KERR MONDAY YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO IF YOU DON'T MIND I'LL DO BOTH AND I JUST WANTED TO CITE CIVIL CODE SECTION FIVE BY FOUR OF THE BILL WHICH READS EACH MEMBER OF THE COUPLE STUFF PHYSICALLY. SHOULD BE PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WELL USING REMOTE TECHNOLOGY TO OBTAIN A MARRIAGE LICENSE PURSUANT TO THIS PART EACH MEMBER OF THE COUPLE SHALL BE IN THE SAME PHYSICAL LOCATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL USING. REMOTE A TECHNOLOGY THE COUNTY CLERK MAY REQUIRE A COUPLE TO COMPLETE AN AFFIDAVIT. IN A FORM PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY CLERK AFFIRMING THAT THEY ARE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATING IN A MARRIAGE. SOME STATIONS USING REMOTE TECHNOLOGY ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PART. AND IF I COULD HAVE MY WITNESS PERHAPS FOLLOW UP THAT BE GREAT. ALL RIGHT.

WITNESS THAT OPPORTUNITY MAYBE HE MIGHT HAVE SOME FUN AT ALL YEAH MR STARLING ARE YOU AVAILABLE WOULD YOU CARE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. YES SIR I MEAN I THINK DID THE SUMMARY ANSWERED IT VERY WELL BUT ALSO ADDED. A NUMBER OF THE COUNTIES. THAT WENT INTO THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW THE SORT OF HAD NEEDED DURING THE STATE HOME OR THE PANDEMIC. OF FOUND DIFFERENT WAYS TO VERIFY IDENTITY- AND THE MOST COMMON ONE THAT THEY USE WITH HAVING THE APPLICANTS ACTUALLY- RESPOND VIA MAIL- PRIOR TO THE CEREMONY THAT WAS SCHEDULED AT A LATER DATE SO THE CLERK WOULD. SEND THE APPLICATION DOWN TO A CALIFORNIA ADDRESS THE PERSON WOULD HAVE TO. RECEIVE IT AND THEN BE- BASICALLY SIDED WITH A WET. SIGNATURE TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY YOU KNOW AT THAT ADDRESS- BEFORE APPEARING ON THE NEW SCREEN. ON A PROJECT AND- THEN AFTER. THAT WE'LL EGGS TOOK PLACE- BUT KIND OF THE POINT OF BILL WAS DEAD FOR COLLATE ALL THE BEST PRACTICES NOT. THAT DISCOVERED DURING THE PANDEMIC THE STATE AND TRY TO. BRING EVERYBODY UP TO A- SORT OF BY BUT PRACTICE. PROCESS TO IF YOU A WIDE ACCOUNTED TO MOVE. AND DO THAT IN DEATH EVEN AFTER THIS IS WHAT THE. THANK YOU MR SORRY. ALL RIGHT. SENATOR JOE. ANY FURTHER. SERVE OR JUST. I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CONSENTE OPPOSED TO POTENTIALLY THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING ON THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK- IT IT IT CAN BE HELPFUL. IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES- I WOULD SUSPECT HOWEVER THAT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MIGHT BE FURTHER OUT THAN WOULD BE NECESSARY GIVEN THAT WE'RE RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC BUT MAYBE I'LL JUST AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. INDIA THE AUTHOR DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT MAYBE IN HER CLOTHES IF SHE WISHES THROUGH THE CHAIR- IS WHAT ARE THE SAFEGUARDS. THAT WOULD BE PUT IN PLACE TO AUTHENTICATE- A PERSON'S IDENTITY I THINK THE SPEAKER. JUST PRIOR JUST KIND OF GLOSSED OVER IN MADE MENTION OF IT BUT- MAYBE YOU CAN GO INTO MORE DETAIL OR HAVE. THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND THE SECOND. IS WE'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN. A CALIFORNIA VERSUS A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED ID. AND THE REASON FOR THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED IDEAS BECAUSE OF THE ENHANCED IDENTIFICATION- IN ON AN AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WE- MOVE FROM JUST A CALIFORNIA ID INTO THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED. SO HOW WOULD THAT PLAY OUT- WOULD THEY BE USING AUTHENTICATION DOCUMENTS THROUGH ONLY A CALIFORNIA ID OR REQUIRE A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED. CALIFORNIA IDEA. HE DIED I. CAN GIVE YOU BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU THE LEAST BREAK RIGHT NOW IS OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO SHOW SOME TYPE OF FORM OF ID- USUALLY THE DRIVER'S LICENSES JOINED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DEFINITELY LOOK INTO. IT AS IT MOVES ALONG YOU LOOKING AT IT JUST CURIOUS BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU SIR GORGEOUS. ALL RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER MICROPHONES WAY IT RAISED- SERVICEMEMBER DAVIES WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE MR CARE MONDAY.

I'VE HAD AN EVENT COMPANY FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS ON THE WEDDING PLANNER. AND SO THIS LAST YEAR AND A HALF I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THEM YOU KNOW PEOPLE TRY TO GET MARRIAGE LICENSE. A LOT OF OUR MILITARY AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GO AND GET THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHIPPING OUT IN REGARDS TO INSURANCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT I'VE ALSO HAD- EIGHTY EIGHT. SOME CONCERNS WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T ABLE TO GET OUT TO GO GET IT. AND SO THIS IS ALSO VERY HANDY SO- I'M HOPING THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST ANOTHER OPTION FOR PEOPLE AND AGAIN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR I'M SURE THINGS WILL BE LOOKING DIFFERENT. BUT I CERTAINLY AM ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO I ASKED FOR AN I OR AN IDEA OF. ALL RIGHT- THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THE SECURE MONTY SHOWS UP ON ANOTHER BILL LATER ON WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT- THERE'S BEEN A MOTION MADAM CHIEF COUNSEL PLEASE. CALL THE ROLL.

RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT THAT WE'RE GONNA PUT THE BILL ON CALL AND I A. C. ASSEMLY MEMBER KYLIE IS HERE- WITH EIGHTY TWO SEVEN TWO. AFTER WE'RE DONE CLEANING THE PODIUM. SEVEN MEMBER KYLIE. WE WELCOME. YOU AND YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR THIS BILL. AIMS TO ASSURE THAT A VICTIM OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT KURDISH PURSUE A CIVIL ACTION. AGAINST THE PERPETRATOR AND OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES- WHAT WE SOMETIMES SEE IS THAT ENROLLMENT AGREEMENTS EITHER SIGNED BY THE PARENT- WILL CONTAIN ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT IS THEN- ENFORCED AGAINST THE CHILD AFTER. AN INJURY HAS OCCURRED- NOW THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY I POINT IF IN ANY CASE- WE MIGHT SEE ARBITRATION AS- A DESIRABLE OPTION IT CAN BE LESS EXPENSIVE FASTER- MORE PRIVATE. HOWEVER THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY- THOSE ADVANTAGES DO NOT ALWAYS OBTAIN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. PRESENTED HERE- FIRST UNLIKE CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES OR OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES- EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH A RIGHT AND IS COMPULSORY THAT. OUR OF THEIR EDUCATION THEY'RE REQUIRED TO ATTEND THE SCHOOL. SECONDLY CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT A FORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN ROLLING IN SCHOOL WHEN THE PARENT- SIGNS THEIR CHILD UP THEY AGREED TO A NUMBER OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO SCHOOL HOURS TUITION DRESS CODE ON THE BIKE BUT- IT'S- ON THE FORESEEABLE AT THAT MOMENT. FOR A PARENT TO BELIEVE THAT A CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD BE PART OF THE CHILD'S EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND SO. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT REQUIRING A VICTIM OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT TO GO TO ARBITRATION IS ON CONSCIONABLE WHICH IS A STANDARD- THAT HAS BEEN HAVE HELD IN THE COURTS EVEN AFTER- THE LANDMARK CASE ON THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. ACT CONCEPCION- AND THE THIRD REASON WHY THIS BILL. IS NECESSARY IS THAT CAL AND IT IS ALLOWABLE UNDER- THAT PRESIDENT IS THAT CALIFORNIA LAW IS CLEAR ON THE DIFFERENCE IN TREATMENT- AFFORDED TO MINORS. PERTINENT CASE LAW SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT CLAIMS HELD BY CHILDREN I CAN NOT BE FORCED INTO ARBITRATION AND CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT. TO DETERMINE ALL MATTERS THAT CONCERN THEIR OWN WELFARE ADDITIONALLY FAMILY CODE SECTION SIXTY SEVEN TEN PROVIDES THE CONTRACT A MINOR MAY BE. DECIPHERED BY THAT MINOR IN THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT DOES NOT SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF A PARENT'S CAPACITY TO CONTRACTUALLY BIND A MINOR- WHEN IT COMES TO WITH THE CHOICE OF FORUM- AS ARBITRATION. AND THIS IS THERE FOR AN ISSUE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS- THREE STATE LEVEL LEGISLATION FOR THE SAKE OF FUTURE VICTIMS I THINK THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION- THE PAST RESTORE- THE RIGHT OF THESE VICTIMS TO PURSUE- THEIR CLAIMS AS PART OF A CIVIL ACTION. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY DAD. THANK YOU SO MEMBER- I NOTE MR RICHARD SCHWARTZ AND MISS REBECCA SCHWARTZ NOT RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER ARE PRESENT TO TESTIFY- TELEPHONICALLY IS THAT CORRECT SOMEONE MEMBER. ALL RIGHT- MODERATOR IF YOU TWO UP- MR SCHWARTZ AND MR SCHWARTZ. BERLIN EUROPEAN- PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS AND THANK YOUR FAMILY MEMBER KYLIE MY NAME IS RICHARD SCHWARTZ I'M A PARTNER WITH BROWN YOUR DROP O'BRIEN IN A WAY AND ALEX AND I HEARD YOU ON THE BOAT I WAY TO EIGHTY TO SEVENTY TWO. EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO WOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT OR CRIMINAL BATTERY IN A SCHOOL CONTACT TO SEEK JUSTICE THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM EVEN IF THE SCHOOLS AND ROAMING AGREEMENT WOULD OTHERWISE THAN THAT DUE TO ARBITRATION. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA LAW AUTHORIZES SCHOOLS TO FORCE STUDENTS AND PARENTS TO SIGN NON NEGOTIABLE AND ENROLLMENT AGREEMENTS THOSE AGREEMENTS OFTEN HAVE CLAUSES THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS ALLOW THOSE SCHOOLS TO HIDE IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE VEIL OF THE CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION EVEN WHEN A STUDENT HAS CLAIMED BASED ON PROVEN CRIMINAL. SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. CORKER CHOIR REPORTS. THIS PROUD. FOR SCHOOL CAN. WHO DESPERATELY NEED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PROCEDURE THEIR SCHOOLS ARE TAKING OR FAILING TO TAKE. TO PREVENT CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ON THEIR PREMISES. EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC IS THE IMPACT OF ARBITRATION ON A VICTIM OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT. CALIFORNIA LAW MAKES CLEAR THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN DECIDE THE MATTER BEFORE THEM NOT ON THE BASIS OF THE LAW OR THE RULES OF EVIDENCE BUT RATHER SOLELY ON ON B. AMBIGUOUS NOTIONS OF EQUITY. AS PERCEIVED BY THAT ARBITRATOR OFTEN A SINGLE PERSON WITH HIS OR HER OWN BIAS EVEN PRECONCEPTIONS. THAT MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR COMPLETELY IGNORE THE LAW AND PREVENT THE STUDENT WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED FROM OBTAINING THE JUSTICE. THEY COULD OBTAIN THROUGH THE COURT. EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO WOULD FIX THAT BY STUDENTS TO DEATH THE FIRM THOUGH THE ROMAN AGREEMENT AFTER BEING THE VICTIM OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO HAS A VERY NARROW SCOPE. ITS PROVISIONS ARE ONLY TRIGGERED WHEN THERE IS CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT FORMED THE BASIS OF THE STUDENT CLAIMS. CALIFORNIA CONVICTED LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO EDUCATE THE COURT THAT THEM AND AVOID THE PUBLIC RECONCILIATION PRODUCT THAT THE BEATING UNITIES NEED TO HEAL AND MOVE ON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND THE PORTENT BELL WHICH WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO SECURING JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. NEXT YOU'LL HEAR FROM MY CLIENT REBECCA SCHWARTZ WHO CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS NOT SIMPLY AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE IT HAS REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES. AND OTHERS ALL BY ASKING EACH SENATOR. TO VOTE. FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU MR TOWARDS- MS REBECCA. SALEABLE YES I AM- THE FLOOR'S YOURS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HONORED TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR A VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE. COMING TOWARD MY FAMILY HAS CHOSEN TO STAND UP FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY TO LOWER THE RISK OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN BEING EXPOSED TO SEXUAL PREDATORS IN OUR SCHOOL. AMONG THE MANY OF THE TRUTH WE HAVE LEARNED THAT MANY WORKING FOR THIS ISSUE IF YOU NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AND THE CURRENT ARBITRATION WILL HELP KEEP IT IN THE DARK. THERE ARE FEW THINGS WORSE THAN HARMING A CHILD ONE THING IS PREVENTING THAT SHOP IN SEEKING JUSTICE FOR THAT HARM SIMPLY IGNORING THAT IT EVER HAPPENED. FOUR YEARS AGO OUR CHILD'S REPEATEDLY AND BRUTALLY RAPED BY A TEACHER AT BRENTWOOD SCHOOL LOS ANGELES. NEARLY EVERY DAY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE PERPETRATOR WAS CRIMINALLY. AND SERVED TIME. OUR CHILDHOOD PERMANENTLY CHANGED DAMAGES GUARD BY THE FEARS OF A FULL. ENGLISH COUPLED WITH THE LOG IN SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT OUR CHILD NEVER GOT THE PROVERBIAL DAY IN COURT. A JURY TRIAL WOULD BE ONE WAY TO BRING ABOUT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE CRIMES IN THE SCHOOLS POLICIES PROCEDURES GUIDELINES GOVERNANCE AND CULTURE WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRIME. AND IN DOING SO WOULD FACILITATE THE HEALING PROCESS FOR A CHILD INSTEAD THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM DO NOT APPLY THE JURY TRIAL BECAUSE SPRINT WITH SCHOOL INCLUDED A MANDATORY CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN IT IN WOMAN AGREEMENT. OUR TRIAL DID NOT SIGN AN AGREEMENT AND YET WOULD HELP TO IT MY HUSBAND AND I FIND BELIEVING THAT MOST ARBITRATION WOULD COVER GRIEVANCES WE MIGHT HAVE WITH THE FULL DISCARDING OUR HEALTH EDUCATION. WE NEVER ENVISIONED IT WOULD COVER A VIOLENT FELONY CRIME AND WE CERTAINLY NEVER ENVISIONED WE WERE SIGNING AWAY OUR CALLS RIGHT CHOOSE YOUR OWN PATH JUSTICE NO PARENT DOES OR SHOULD. THE COMMON PARENTS TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT IS THAT ARBITRATION IS INTENDED TO RESOLVE ISSUES RELATED TO ATTENDING A COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT ABOUT A GREATER SCHOOL CURRICULUM. ARBITRATION CERTAINLY HAS ITS PLACE IN THE CIVIL JUSTICE. BUT A GREAT VICTIM SHOULD. HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. HI TO OUR- CALL TO EDGE. SEXUAL THE OF A TRIAL. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO UNDER. ANY CHANCE OF TRIGGERING. THE ACCOUNTABILITY.

SHE BUILT HER UNCLE UNINVESTIGATED THE CONSEQUENCE OF PARENTS AGREE NOT TO SUE THE SCHOOL FOR GRADE THE DRESS CODE REGARDLESS OF AMERICAN ARBITRATION OF UNLOCKING THE COURT. SHOULD SEX CRIMES AGAINST SCHOOL CHILDREN AUTOMATICALLY COVERED BEHIND SO THE CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. AS A LIFELONG CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ASK HOW THAT STRUGGLE WITH THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW IN IN ROME AND AGREEMENT SIGNED BY PARENTS AS REQUIRED CONDITION FOR THE CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL CAN OPERATE THE HIGH TECH CRIMES OR OTHER HIGH FELONIES. BEHIND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION WE IMPLORE YOU TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE BY PASSING AB TWO SEVEN TWO INTO LAW.

THE FAA- PERMIT OUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE TO BE INVALIDATED BY GENERALLY APPLICABLE CONTRACT OFFENSES SUCH AS FRAUD TO RESTAURANT CONTABILIDADE. BUT NOT BY DEFENSE DID THAT APPLY ONLY TO ARBITRATION. OR DERIVE THEIR MEANING TO THE FACT THAT AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IF THAT ISSUE- AND THAT IN FACT THERE IS THREE THIRTY NINE- WE THINK THIS BILL FALLS SQUARELY INTO THAT THIS IS A BILL WHICH- IS. DESIGNED AS- AN EXCEPTION TO ARBITRATION IN A LETTER TO CONTACT THE JUST ABOUT ARBITRATION. YOU CAN WAIVE AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN THAT CONTEXT NOT CREATING A GENERALLY APPLICABLE DEFENSE TO OTHER CONTRACTS SURE FOR THAT REASON WE BOUGHT I THINK IT'S CALLED THE TYPICALLY HERE.

YOU HAVE EIGHT ZERO SO FAR ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU SOOOO OR KYLIE WILL PUT THIS ON CALL NEXT WE HAVE A SEVEN MEMBER BENNETT. ALL RIGHT. SEVEN MEMBER BENNETT. EIGHTY EIGHT SIX ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU AND TO THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE TODAY. TWO EIGHT EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY ONE A- I BELIEVE THE FOCUS OF SHOULD BE ONE SIMPLE POINT AND THAT IS ABOUT 30% OF MOBILE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED UNDER LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAWS THOSE LOCAL RECKONED WITH TROLL LAWS HAVE BEEN VALIDATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BY THE COURTS ON THE BASIS THAT WE NEED THAT LAW TO PROTECT THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. THAT THE PARK OWNER HAS IN THEIR MOBILE HOME. IF PARK OWNERS PURCHASE THE MOBILE HOMES IN THEIR PARK THEY PULL THOSE UNITS HELP FROM LOCAL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES AND THUS REDUCE THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY. I HAVE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND MOBILE HOMES IN MY DISTRICT AND MANY OF THEM ARE COVERED BY LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAWS. THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW THAT WAS PASSED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IDENTIFIED THAT PARK OWNERS NEEDED TO APPLY THE SAME RULES TO THEMSELVES THAT THEY APPLY TO THEIR PARK RESIDENTS. MY GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS JUST SIMPLY MAKE SURE THAT THAT LAW IS ENFORCED. BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR CREATING AN OUTPOST CONSENT FOR ANY LONGER FOR PARK OWNERS TO PURCHASE THESE. MOBILE HOMES AND TAKE THEM OUT OF THE LOCAL RENT CONTROL AND THEREFORE OUT OF THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. MY GOAL IS NOT TO TRY TO FIND A WAY FOR ALL OF THE PARK RESIDENTS TO START RENTING OUT THEIR MOBILE HOMES AND I THINK. IT'S NOT REALISTIC TO THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT IF THEY LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME AND THEY ARE COVERED UNDER RENT CONTROL. WHAT THEY MOST WANT IS STABILITY AND THEY WANT STABILITY TO KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE LIVING WITH LIKE MINDED NEIGHBORS COVERED BY THE SAME. RECORD LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAW AND SO CONSEQUENTLY I THINK WHAT THIS. DOESN'T DO AS MANY OF THE SCENARIOS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT BY THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WHICH IS CREATE TERRIBLE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE'LL BE ALL KINDS OF PRINTING ETCETERA. AND I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT I THINK THE STAFF ANALYSIS THAT WAS PRESENTED TO YOU AND THIS HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING AND THAT STAFF ANALYSIS VERY CLEARLY POINTS OUT A NUMBER ONE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION WAS VERY CLEAR. NOW THAT THE OPPONENTS ARE PICKING AND CHOOSING- AND THEN ALSO OFFERING SOME VERY ODD. ANTIDOTE ALL PIECES OF EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN TERMS OF LEASING AND SUB LEASING AND RENTING OUT OF THEIR SPACES. IN REALITY THE FINAL THING. I'D LIKE TO LEAVE WITH YOU IS SIMPLY THIS. IF OWNERS DON'T TO RE. TO OUT THEIR MO HOMES. AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. AS I LIKE TO KEEP THE LOCAL RECORD TROLL ALL THERE AND KEEP THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S THE RULE AND THEN THEY NEED TO FOLLOW IT ALSO. BUT IF THEY FOLLOW THAT RULE. AND FRIEND THIS BILL CLARIFIES WHAT. WAS IN THE LANGUAGE BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL HARRIS- CLARIFIED IN HER. OPINION IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. THEN WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BOTH KEEP THE STATUS QUO AND TAKE AWAY AN INCENTIVE FOR PARK OWNERS TO PURCHASE HOMES TO MOVE THEM OUT OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU SOME MEMBER BENNETT I UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER BRUCE STANTON IS ON THE PHONE LINE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS THAT RIGHT MODERATOR. YES I O SHOW THEIR CONNECTED- I USE YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANK YOU YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES WAS JUST THANK YOU GET IT GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRUCE STANTON GENERAL COUNSEL FOR GSM- WELL. WORK MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ARE AN EQUALLY TREATED WHEN IT COMES TO THE ABILITY TO RENT OR SUBLEASE THEIR HOMES WHILE MOST PARKS. HAVE RULES PROHIBITING RESIDENTS FROM REGULAR SUB LEASING WHICH THE LAW ALLOWS. THOSE SAME PARKS OFTEN PURCHASE AND RENT OUT OR SELL PLEASE MOBILE HOMES OWNED BY PARK MANAGEMENT AND THIS RESULTS. IN AN UNFAIR SITUATION WHERE THE PARK OWNER IS NOT FOLLOWING ITS OWN RULES. AND GET THE BENEFIT OF SELF POLICING BALLPARK RESIDENTS DO NOT. THE TWENTY THIRTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL OPINION DECLARED THAT BASED UPON THE EXISTING MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW. PARK RULES APPLY EQUALLY TO MANAGEMENT RESIDENTS AT A PARK OWNER IS ALSO BOUND TO FOLLOW ITS OWN RULES PROHIBITING SELF POLICING. BUT PARK OWNERS HAVE TRIED TO DISTINGUISH THE AG OPINION BIKES AND THAT THE RULE PROHIBITING. RESIDENTS FROM SO POLICING DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM SINCE THEY OWN THE HOMES AND THEY'RE DIRECTLY RENTING THEM. THIS IS REALLY THOUGH A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WHETHER YOU CALL IT A RENTAL OR IT'S SO PLEASE THE END RESULT IS THE SAME. RESIDENTS CAN'T SO PLEASE. PARK MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE EQUALLY BOUND IT SHOULD ABIDE BY THEIR OWN RULES. THE MRO SHOULD BE AMENDED TO SPECIFICALLY ELIMINATE THIS DOUBLE STANDARD. THE FINAL KEY POINTS FIRST THE BILL DOES NOT IMPEDE A PARK OWNERS ABILITY TO CREATE OR CHANGE ITS RULES IF IT WISHES TO PATTERNS OF LEASING A RENTING. IT CONTINUES TO HAVE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DO THAT. OR IF YOU WISH TO ALLOW SUBLEASE KERENSKY WE COULD DO THAT TOO. SECONDLY THE BILL DOES NOT PREVENT THE PARK FROM HOUSING THEIR EMPLOYEES AND RECENT ADVANCEMENTS HAVE EVEN EXPANDED AND CLARIFIED THAT POINT EACH. THE BILL SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT WANTS TO PARK ON A BENCH AT THE STATION TO ALLOW OR PROHIBIT SEPT WE SEEK A RANKING. EVERYONE INCLUDING THE PARK OWNER WOULD ABIDE BY AND FOLLOW THE SAME RULES. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU. TAKING A STAND. OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT IN THE GALLERY I SEE NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE I SEE NO ONE.

PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE. GO AHEAD I SEE ONE WITNESS DEPOSITION- THAT'S NOT MR GOVERNOR BUT GO AHEAD. NO MR GOVERNORS MUCH BETTER LOOKING. THAN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS WYSOCKI ON BEHALF OF W. AND MAY. AND WMA MUST RESPECTFULLY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT OPPOSE AB SIXTY ONE. WE ESSENTIALLY DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF COMPARING RENTING HOMES TO SELF POLICING. WE WANT TO ALSO THANK THE CONSULTANT TIM GRIFFITHS FOR HIS TIME AND WORK ON THE BILL IT'S BEEN MUCH APPRECIATED AND HE'S PROBABLY SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME WITH US ACCORDING TO HIM. WMA POSES THIS MEASURE BECAUSE OWNERS ACTUALLY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE RESIDENT WHO OWNS THE HOME. I CERTAINLY SEE DOESN'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE OWNER OF THE PARK AND MOST OFTEN DOESN'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE RESIDENT OWNER EITHER. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T BELIEVE SEVEN LEASING AND RENTING OR THE SAME CONCEPT. THERE'S ALSO NO DEFINING OF WHAT A SHORT TERM RENTAL IS IN THIS BILL. CONNORS RAN T. THEIR MONTH TO MONTH. OR ON AN ANNUAL YEAR BASIS. NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENTS ANYONE FROM RUNNING EVERY WEEK. W. M. A. BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST LANGUAGE. LIMITING SEVENTY SEEM TO NO LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS. FINALLY IF SOMEONE'S LEASING SUB LEASING A HOME FOR SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR. IN DOING IT ANNUALLY. WHY ARE THEY GETTING% THE BENEFIT OF RENT CONTROL. SHOULD SOMEBODY ELSE BE GETTING THAT BENEFIT SOMEBODY THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO NEEDS TO HELP. THE STATE SHOULD WANT PEOPLE TO MOVE OUT SO THAT SOMEBODY THAT NEEDS DIRECT CONTROL SPACE GETS. FOR THESE REASONS WMA DOESN'T BELIEVE SO POLICING IS GOOD POLICY FOR HOUSING. ESPECIALLY IN RING CONTROLLED AREAS AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY CONTINUES TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU THANKS SIR. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE ROOM ONE TWELVE NO ONE ELSE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE IN OPPOSITION LET'S TURN TO THE PHONE LINES. MODERATOR ANYONE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION TO. A. B. EIGHT SIX ONE. AND LATER ON IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION TO A V. EIGHT SIX ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE ZERO OUR POSITION. MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING THE STATION I COULD HEAR I WAS ASSIGNED AS A PRIMARY WITNESS AN OPPOSITION I'M HAPPY TO GIVE MY TESTIMONY IF IT'S APPROPRIATE NOW ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AGAIN J. SNYDER WITH ADULTS CAN GO OVER ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE- REGRETTABLY I CONTINUE TO BE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED- BYE BYE COMMITTEE TODAY- BUT DO WANT TO ECHO MISTER WYSOCKI DEPRECIATION FOR YOUR STAFF'S TIME AND ATTENTION OF THE BELL AND EDIT KNOWLEDGE THAT. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD RABIES RELATED TO UNCLEAR LANGUAGE IN THE BILL ON DESIGNATION TENETS OF THEM PLAYS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS THERE ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT STILL REMAIN- AS ADAM WITH THAT. GOT MR MIGHT TALKING NOTED. THERE IS AN ISSUE RELATED TO APPLICATION OF RENT CONTROL- THE BILL IS SILENT- AND WE BELIEVE CPA BELIEVES THAT THAT THAT WHERE. THE MENTAL PART COMING HOME IS SUBJECT TO RENT CONTROL RENTAL OF THE- OF THE RESIDENT HOME HOME SHOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO RENT CONTROL- AND- SPECIALLY RELEVANT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE YOUR COMMITTEE WILL BE CONSIDERING A BILL NEXT WEEK EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD SUBJECT. APARTMENT HOMES STATEWIDE DIRECT CONTROL. NEXT WHAT WE APPRECIATE AGAIN THE COMMITTEE AND DIRECTING SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE RELATED TO HOUSING FOR EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE THE PROPOSED RATIO IN THE BILL OF ONE EMPLOYEE HOME FOR EVERY TWO HUNDRED HOMES IN A PARK. MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE MAY NOT CAPTURE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT FOR ALL PARTS OF IN PARTICULAR LARGER PARTS AND WE HAD SUGGESTED. ONE EMPLOYEE HOME FOR EVERY- ONE HUNDRED HOMES IN A PARK. THE BILL ALSO DOESN'T HAVE A MECHANISM FOR THOSE PARKS THAT IT. ACTED AT TEN SIXTY ONE WERE TO PASS. WHICH WOULD DISCONTINUE RENTAL OF BOTH PARK AND READ THEIR OWN HOMES GOING FORWARD TERE'S NO REAL PROCESS. TO WIND DOWN THOSE TENDENCIES- AND LASTLY. IN THE EVENT. OF THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT REHABILITATIVE WORK IN A PARK AND REALLY THINK EVENTS LIKE- A WILD FIRE AND EARTHQUAKE. THERE'S NO- EXCEPTION IN. THIS BILL OR OR NO MEANS ALLOWING WORKERS AND EMPLOY TO BE. IN THE PARK OF THAT WORK THAT IS TAKEN ON. SO ONCE. WITH WITH THE REMAIN WE MUSTER OPPOSED TO THE BILL RESPECT REQUEST YOU KNOW. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- LET IF I HAD A USE MEMBER THE U. X. THE MEMBER PROPOSED ON PAGE. COMMENTS SO NOW YES I DO ALL RIGHT AFTER THE STAFF. OUR OTHERS IT UP AS- ON THE PHONE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEITH FRIEDMAN. FOR THE PAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS MY WIFE AND I HAVE OWNED AND OPERATED THE SUN RISES MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITY IN CITRUS HEIGHTS SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA. WE STRONGLY OPPOSE A. B. EIGHT SIXTY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT TO THE NUMBER SIXTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. DURATION AT AND- PARKED ON A BEACH WITH PARKING VILLAGE AMONG OTHERS OPPOSE THE BILL IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX UP TENANTS OF THE TENANT YOU'RE UNABLE TO. RT THANK YOU. NEXT TO THE NUMBER FIFTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. NUMBER FIFTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THIS IS ROBIN BUT STAN AND UNLESS FURTHER AMENDED I OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. AT THE TIME THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING BACK THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS COMMENTS I SEE NO MICROPHONES RAISED CENTER LAYERED MOVES THE BILL NO SENATOR LETTERHEAD AS MICROPHONES THAT ARE LAYERED HIS MICROPHONE UP ALL RIGHT CENTER LAYERED WITH YOUR MICROPHONE UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT- I WANTED TO JUST SPEAK FOR A MOMENT TO THIS BILL BECAUSE I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS BEFORE HAND TO AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE APPRECIABLE. MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS IN THE SENATE DISTRICT AND WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I WORK WITH THE REALTORS AND DID A NUMBER OF CONSUMER PROTECTION BILLS RELATED TO MOBILE HOME PARKS AND I THINK THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE I KNOW THIS IS BASIC TO EVERYBODY BUT BETWEEN THE COSTA HAWKINS STANDARD RENT CONTROL FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES AND SUCH THAT WAS ADOPTED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL BECAUSE MOBILE HOME OWNERS ARE HOSTAGES THEY DO NOT OWN THE LAND THAT IS UNDERNEATH THEIR MOBILE HOME AND IF THERE IS AN EXCESSIVE RATE INCREASE. FOR THE SPACE OF THAT THEIR MOBILE HOMES ON AND THEY OWN THE MOBILE HOME OR THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUILDING MANY TIMES TO MOVE IT THEY'RE AT THE MERCY SO THERE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE LOCALS THAT SERVE A RENT CONTROL THAT SURVIVE. THAT GUARANTEES A RATE OF RETURN THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE PARK OWNER END GUARANTEES A RATE OF RENT INCREASES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOBILE HOME OWNERS IN MANY CASES ARE SENIORS AND PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES SO THIS IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A STATE WHERE THERE ARE INCREDIBLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CHALLENGES AND WHAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS AND MAYBE THEY'RE STILL AMENDMENTS. THAT NEED TO BE DONE ON CERTAIN PARTS OF THIS. BUT THIS BILL A TO THE- FROM RENT CONTROL OF SOME OF THESE MOBILE HOMES AND I THINK IT IS. OF NEEDED JUST GIVEN WHAT WE FACE WITH REGARD TO HOUSING IN THE STATE AND I THINK THE AUTHOR IS COMING DIRECTLY OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND DIRECTLY EXPERIENCED AT THIS IN HIS PREVIOUS INCARNATION. AND IS BRINGING SOMETHING THAT HE SAW NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH THIS BILL. SO I THINK IT'S STRONGLY WORTHY OF OUR SUPPORT TO AND I'M GOING TO BE READY TO MOVE IT AND VOTE FOR IT WHENEVER THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALL RIGHT. CENTER LATER THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME I MOVED HE MOVES THE BILL ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE. SO REMEMBER BENNETT YOU CAN CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO CHEER. THIS BILL WOULD MOVE THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY IN THE COMMITTEE AT- DID VERY WELL WHEN IT GOT TO THE FLOOR THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF CONFUSION SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY. A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS. FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE OF THE SENATE STAFF AND THAT IS WELL THE PLAIN LANGUAGE APPEARS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE AND THAT'S THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE NINETEEN NINETY THREE AT THE FOOT OF SECTION SEVEN NINETY EIGHT OF THE NINETEEN NINETY pRENT TO UNLOCK SOME PARKS APPARENTLY INSIST THE SECTION SEVEN NINETY EIGHT DOES NOT PREVENT THEM FROM RENTING OUT THEIR MOBILE HOMES THAT THEY OWN. EVEN THE EVEN AS THEY DENIED THE SAME POSSIBILITY TO PARK RESIDENTS AND THEN AGAIN LATER IT SAYS THIS BILL IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD CODIFICATION. OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CONCLUSION. AND THEN FINALLY IT SAYS THE OPPONENTS CORRESPONDENTS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IN SPITE OF THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF CIVIL CODE SEVEN NINETY EIGHT. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION INTERPRETING IT THEY DO NOT FULLY ACCEPT THE PARKS MUST COMPLY WITH THE RULES SAY PROBABLY GREAT AGAINST RUNNING AND SUB LEASING TO THE SAME EXTENT BECAUSE OUR RESIDENTS AND THE RESIDENTS CAST. AND I THINK MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN MY LAST SENTENCE PULLING FRAGMENTS OUT OF THE OPINION THE OPPONENTS CONTEND THAT THE OPINION SOMEHOW SUPPORTS THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION. SO WHEN YOU HAVE OPPONENTS STAND UP AND SAY THE BILL DOESN'T HAVE A PROPER LANGUAGE TO HANDLE- SHORT TERM RENTALS IN ONE WEEK RENTALS- AND YET YOU HEAR THAT. THE PARK OWNERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH THOSE RULES. ANYWAY THAT THEY WANT JUST AS LONG AS THEY FOLLOW THE SAME RULES SO WHEN THEY RAISE THE SHOP IS THE THESE ARGUMENTS I HOPE WE COULD REMEMBER THAT THEY CAN ESTABLISH THE RULES FOR THEIR PARKS. THIS BILL SIMPLY REMINDS THEM THAT AS IT HAS BEEN THE LAW THEY NEED TO FOLLOW THE SAME RULES OF THE ESTABLISHMENT REBAJAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO IN MEMBER BENNETT AND CHIEF COUNSEL RECALL ROLE. THIS IS A V. EIGHT SIX ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BENNETT- WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR WHERE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED UMBERG HI.

SO SOME REMEMBER RAYOS CLOSURES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I PRESENT TO YOU AB NINE HUNDRED THAT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A TRUSTEE OF A TRUST A CHARITABLE TRUSTTO PROVIDE NOTICE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH THE CHARITABLE TRUSTEE INTENDS TO SELL OR TRANSFER ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CHARITABLE ASSETS OWNED BY THE TRUST. UNDER EXISTING LAWS NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO GIVE NO WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHEN THE CORPORATION INTENDS TO SELL OR TRANSFER ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS HOWEVER DUE TO AN EXISTING INCONSISTENCY WITHIN CALIFORNIA LAW. A CHARITABLE TRUST CHARITABLE TRUSTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO GIVE THE AG THIS SIMPLE NOTICE THAT NONPROFIT BENEFIT CORPORATIONS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED A SIMPLY FIXES THIS INCONSISTENCY AND CURRENT LAW AND ENSURES THAT TRUSTEES ARE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.

THAT WILL HELP LIMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF DEALING IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS AND HELP ENSURE THAT THE TRANSACTION IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHARITABLE TRUST. AND THE TRUSTEE THE ACT YOU CAN GOOD SAYING THAT WE'VE BEEN ADVISING THE OTHER TOPICS AND PARTICIPATING AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BANKERS ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS.

TOWARD UNDERSCORING THE BANKS WOULD TRUST DEPARTMENT OR SUBJECT TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT SUPERVISION AND ROUTINE EXAMINATION. OUR FOCUS HERE HERE AT THE HELP CORPORATE TRUSTEES COMPLY WITH THE LAW OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THE MEASURE IS THE LACK OF DEFINITION FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL.

AS STATED IN THE OPENING A CONTINUE WORK ON A WET AND WE JUST FIX IT HERE IN JUDICIARY IN MINDEN AND THEN MOVE IT ON- SO NUMBER RACE YOU CAN RESPOND OR RESPOND IN YOUR CLOTHES I DON'T MIND RESPONDING AT THIS POINT I WOULD REFER. MY COLLEAGUE TO PAGE SIX OF THE MOUSE'S WHICH NOTES THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA CODES NOTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DELIBERATELY ELECTS TO USE THAT TERM. TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY AND CONSIDERATION OF DIFFERENT FACTS AND FACT PATTERNS INSTEAD OF CODIFYING AN ARBITRARY PERCENTAGE. THE TERM HAS BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS AND CURRENTLY OVER TEN THOUSAND NONPROFITS AND CHARITABLE PICTURED CHARITIES COMPLY WITH THIS REGULATION. FROM THE ANALYSIS AND IF I MAY READ. FOR THE PHRASE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ISN'T UNDEFINED TERM OF ART USED THROUGHOUT THE CODES SIMILAR PROVISIONS USING THIS PHRASE THAT APPLY TO NON PROFITS HAVE BEEN IN THE BOOKS SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE CAUSED SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE PROBLEMS FURTHERMORE FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE THERE IS ARGUABLY VIRTUE IN SOME DEGREE OF M. AND PRECISION IF THE PHRASE IS DEFINED TO MEAN EXACTLY 75% OR MORE OF THE ASSETS. A TRUSTEE COULD AVOID THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT BY SELLING A FRACTION LESS ASSUMING THE MARKET VALUE IS READILY ASCERTAINABLE. USING A GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD LONGSTANDING TERM OF ART GIVES YOU TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE FLEXIBILITY TO EXECUTE ITS DUTIES IN A RANGE OF SITUATIONS. FINALLY THE COST OF COMPLIANCE IS MINIMAL. IN BORDERLINE CASES A TRUSTEE CAN ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION BY SIMPLYPROVIDING WRITTEN NOTICE. THANK YOU- CENTER JONES. AS GOOD AS ALL RIGHT- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS- SO I CASKEY. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE STAFF REPORT ON FOOTNOTE FOUR SAYS THAT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHT WHEN WE CHANGE CORPORATION CODE THERE'S BEEN NO PUBLISHED CASES ADDRESSING THE MEANING OF THE PHRASE IN EITHER THIS THE STATUTES THAT THE- THE ASSEMBLYWOMAN- PUT IN SO I WOULD HISTORICALLY A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE COME TO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THE SIX SIXTY STRICKEN THE SECOND DISTRICT HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND THERE'S COMPETING LAW WITHIN CITY OR INTERPRETATION ALONG CALIFORNIA THEY ASKED FOR THAT. CLARIFICATION THAT DOES NOT SEEM THE CASE IN THIS INSTANCE THANK YOU JUDGE WHAT KOWSKI ALL RIGHT- OTHER COMMENTS. OTHER COMMENTS NO OBVIOUS CENTER COVER EUROPE. MOVE THE BILL THE COUPLE EUROS BILL ONE QUICK QUESTION MR GOULD- AND I TAKE YOUR POINT WITH RESPECT TO SOME AMBIGUITY AS TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARM AND WE DON'T WANT TO NEGOTIATE THE LANGUAGE HERE IN COMMITTEE BUT IF IT WERE 50% OR MORE WITH THAT ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS. INSTEAD OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL- IF WE SUBSTITUTE THE TERM 50% OR MORE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR I MEAN I THINK WE ARE SOMEWHAT AGNOSTIC WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS SO LONG AS WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT CAUSES THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE NOTICE SO IF FOR EXAMPLE. INITIALLY ALL MEANT MORE THAN A MAJORITY AT WOULD AT LEAST HAVE A GREATER CERTAINTY- WE WOULD NOT OPPOSE THAT IT WOULD PROVIDED GREATER CERTAINTY. WITH RESPECT TO WHAT CARDS NOTICE TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THE NEW PROVISION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- ALL RIGHT. BETTER TO CANCEL THE CALL THE ROLL.

BRIEFLY WE STRONGLY OPPOSE AB ONE OH NINE SIX BECAUSE FIRST THE VARIOUS NEW MULTI WORD PHRASES USED TO REPLACE THE UNIVERSAL WORD ALIEN ARE UTTERLY CONFUSING AND HAVE NO COMMON THREAD TO ANY US CODES LAWS STATUTES FORMS A GREEN CARDS FOR THE NATIONAL ENUMERATION SYSTEM THAT ASSIGNS UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS ONE OF WHICH IS ALIEN. SECONDLY WHILE A. B. TEN NINETY SIX CLAIMS TO MAKE QUOTE NON SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES AND QUOTE BY REPLACING THE WORD ALIEN WITH WHAT MULTI WORDED PHRASES FROM ALL CALIFORNIA CODES NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THE TERM ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS FIRST COINED. IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT IN THE ALIEN AND SEDITION ACTS SINCE THAT TIME LITERALLY MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF U. S. AND STATE LAWS BOOKS ETCETERA USING ALIENS AS A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER SO TO CLAIM THIS BILL IS MAKING NINE SUBSTANDARD CHANGES IN. IS AN OUTRIGHT FALSE SKIS ME FELL PAULSON MILLIONS OF CHANGES ARE IN FACT QUITE SOME STANDARDS. ISO NINE THOUSAND IS V. WORLD'S BEST KNOWN HARMONIZE QUALITY MANAGEMENT STANDARD THE TERM ALIEN IS ALSO A HARMONIZED IN STANDARD TERM USED AROUND THE WORLD. IN FACT LAFAYETTE USES NICKEL SONY MARKED ON PASSPORTS WHICH MEANS BAILEY AND FOR CALIFORNIA TO REPLACE A STANDARD WORD WITH DIFFERENT PHRASES LITERALLY MEANS YOUR NEW BILL WILL BE SUBSTANDARD. ALIEN REGISTRATION NUMBERS ARE ASSIGNED TO EVERYONE WHO APPLIES FOR A GREEN CARD CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO FIT PHRASES ONTO A GREEN CARD.

BRITAIN SINCE NINETEEN SINCE SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT THIRD THE BILL APPEARS TO BE. KLUBER THE TRUE MEANING OF WHAT ALIEN MEANS AND MAKES IT HARD TO DISTINGUISH WHO IS ILLEGAL AND WHO IS LEGAL. WHAT AN INSULT. NOT ONLY TO MY NATURALIZED FATHER BUT TO THE MANY OTHER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO BECAME NATURALIZED CITIZENS WHO WORKED HARD TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE CITIZENSHIP AND NO LONGER.

WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BUT QUITE FRANKLY WE KNOW AND MY GRANDMOTHER MY MOTHER- IN THE PAST AND THEIR DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN CALLED. AN ALIEN BEFORE AND IT HURTS IT IS DEHUMANIZING IT'S VERY UNSOPHISTICATED WORD AT THIS TIME- OUTDATED IN VERY HOT STYLE AND SO I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE NOW TURNING THE CURVE AND WE CAN BE AN EXAMPLE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO PUSH. FORWARD IN ALL FEDERAL LAWS. AS WE KNOW ICE IN ITSELF IS NOT EVEN UTILIZING THIS TERM NOT UTILIZING ALIEN THEY'RE NOT USE LIGHT UTILIZING ASSIMILATION BECAUSE THAT IS NOT PROPER IT'S AGAIN VERY UNSOPHISTICATED.
