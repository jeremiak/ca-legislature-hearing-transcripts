THE HEALTH CURRENT THAT THE HEALTH CRISIS HAS GREATLY LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO MEET IN PERSON BECAUSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESTRICTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME THE IMPACT OF A PANDEMIC HAS CREATED UNPRECEDENTED CHANGES IN OUR REVENUE RESOURCES AND ARE SPENDING NEEDS. WE MUST ACT TO ADDRESS THE CHANGES FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. FURTHERMORE WE MUST ACT IN THE FACE OF LIMITATIONS THAT SURROUND US EVERYWHERE WE LOOK TODAY. THE EXTRAORDINARY ACTION WE TAKE TODAY WILL HELP US TO DELIBERATE AND GET OUR BUDGET APPROVED BY THE JUNE FIFTEENTH DEADLINE IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE PROCESS WILL ALLOW EACH O US TO DISCUSS THE BUDGET FREELY. WITHOUT SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS ON DISCUSSION IMPOSED BY OUR NORMAL PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES. THAT MEANS THAT LATER ON WE CAN VOTE BASED ON A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM. AND THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS BEFORE US. BEFORE WE MOVE ON I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF THE STAFF OF THE CHIEF CHIEF CLERK. TGS STAFF. RULES COMMITTEE STAFF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. R. I. T. TEAM AND THE SERGEANT AT ARMS WHO pIT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO THIS WORK. AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE MISTER CALDERON UNDER MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MOVE THAT THE ASSEMBLY RESOLVE INTO A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF HEARING TESTIMONY RELATIVE TO THE STATE BUDGET. MOST REQUIRES A SECOND SECOND BY MS WALDRON THIS TAKES A MAJORITY OF THOSE PRESENT AND VOTING ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE. OPPOSED SAY NO THE AYES HAVE IT THE MOTION CARRIES MEMBERS I AM APPOINTING ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE WHOLE MR TING YOU MAY PERSON. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FIRST LET ME JUST JOIN YOU AT ALSO THINKING- YOUR STAFF IN PARTICULAR MR BRIAN NEIGHBOR MR JASON SYDNEY MISSED RADICE TELL MS CAREY CORN WELL AS WELL AS ONE TORRANCE LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK ALSO- THE RULES COMMITTEE TEAM WITH EVER BRAVER AND ALL HER AMAZING STAFF HAVE REALLY WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE WE WERE ABLE TO. DO THIS COMMITTEE TODAY ALSO THANK CHIEF BUCKLEY AND ALL THE SERGEANTS OR ALL THEIR ASSISTANCE AND LASTLY WE HAVE RICK MADE IN THE TV CREW WHO ARE STREAMING THE SLIDE TO MAKE SURE NOT ONLY THAT THE PUBLIC CAN WATCH IT BUT THAT THERE'S A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THIS INFORMATION REACHES ALL OF CONTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE TEAM THAT WORKED VERY VERY HARD. TO MAKE THIS- THE FIRST ME THE WHOLE NUMBER EIGHTY FIVE YEARS TODAY I HAVE THE HONOR OF SITTING AT SPEAKER WILLIE BROWN SUGAR WITH SPEAKER WHEN WE ASKED THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. THE LOOK THEY COMMITTEE REFER WHICH AS WE FACE FROM THE CALL TEAM HAD DEVON. IT'S ALL COME TO GET BY THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE. YEAH BUT ALSO MAINTAIN A PRO. PHYSICAL DISTANCE. TO PROTECT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. THE ASSEMBLY IS HOLDING FLOOR SO FROM FIRST TIME SINCE WITH READ ON THE- AS WITH A-OTHER ORGAN. WE'VE HAD THE MODIFIER BUSINESS TO ADOPT TO A NEW ENVIRONMENT. TODAY WE ARE BACK TOGETHER AS ONE BODY TO DO THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA JOIN TOGETHER TO FLATTEN THE CURVE. SAVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES OF WE COLLECTIVELY AND COOPERATIVELY WORK TOGETHER TO SLOW TRANSMISSION. NOW WE MUST COME TOGETHER TO ASSIST ALL THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVELIHOODS BY STAYING AT HOME. AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIANS NEED US THE MOST WE ARE FEWER RESOURCES TO HELP. THIS YEAR OUR BUDGET IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER WE MUST MAKE EVERY DOLLAR COUNT WE HAVE TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET. YET ENSURE OUR PLANS PROVIDE A HELPING HAND TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC WITH ALMOST EVERY CALIFORNIAN WORKING MANY FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO SAY EVEN A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. SINCE ITS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MORE THAN FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOW APPLIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. WE MUST FOCUS OUR RESOURCES TO ENSURE THOSE FAMILIES ARE HOUSING ECONOMICALLY STABLE OTHERWISE W WILL HAVE TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT STATE RESOURCES. TO HELP THEM DOWN THE LINE. TODAY'S COMMITTEE THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS WILL BEGIN WITH THE DISCUSSION OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AT THE STATE. AND THE OPTIONS WE HAVE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. IT WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE TRADE OFF FROM THE REST WITH CONSIDERABLY FINALIZE OUR SPENDING PLAN. OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS WILL SHAPE THE DIRECTION. OF OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET PLAN. SO WHAT LIES AHEAD THE WHAT CHALLENGES DO WE FACE. HOW DO WE ASSIST CALIFORNIANS WITH THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. HOW DO WE BALANCE OUR STATE'S LONG TERM FISCAL HEALTH AGAINST CUTS IN GOVERNMENT SERVICES WHICH WILL EXACERBATE THE ECONOMIC PAIN FAMILIES ARE NOW FEELING. HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RISK SHOULD OUR STATE TAKE LONG TO AID THOSE FAMILIES. WHO HAVE NO SAVINGS AND NO RESOURCES TO BORROW FROM. IF WE MUST MANAGE THIS DISEASE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME AS SCIENTISTS PREDICT. HOW DO WE ALLOW FOR QUICK AND DECISIVE ACTIONS NEEDED IN TIMES OF CRISIS. WITHOUT SACRIFICING A DELIBERATIVE IN TRANSPARENT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. HOW DO WE ENSURE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE. TO STAY AT HOME. I HAVE EVERY FAITH CALIFORNIANS WILL AGAIN RISE TO THIS CHALLENGE AND FIND A BETTER PLACE AT THE END OF THIS JOURNEY. TODAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY MEMBER TO COMMENT ON THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSALS WAS TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE ILLEGAL ANY QUESTIONS TO ASSIST THEM WITH THEIR DELIBERATIONS. I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. TO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WITH THAT I CALL ON ALL VICE CHAIR OF OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE MISTER WE DON'T. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENT IN THE LEGISLATURE AS- WE GATHER. TO TRY AND CRAFT A BUDGET THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH ONE PURPOSE AND ONE PURPOSE ALONE. WHICH IS TO SET CALIFORNIA ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY FROM THIS UNPRECEDENTED THAT. TO THAT END. ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M GOING TO BE DIRECTED TO THE LA ONLY DO YOU HAVE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO ASK JUST ONE QUESTION DOES THE MAY REVISION THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PRESENTED SET US ON THAT PATH IN MANY WAYS I THINK IT DOES BUT I HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS THE FIRST OF MY CONCERNS. IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS BUDGET SETS ON APPROPRIATE DIVISION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY ON ONE HAND AND TO THE OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THE OTHER. WHEN WE LEFT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WE GAVE THE GOVERNOR OF BILLION DOLLARS IN APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY TO STOP THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS AND I THINK THAT WAS A VERY APPROPRIATE ACTION. FOR US TO TAKE HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR'S ASKING US TODAY TO GIVE HIM. AN ADDITIONAL THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF SPENDING AUTHORITY. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT TO GIVEN AUTHORITY. TO SPEND THE TEN MILLION DAHLE TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FUNDS TO COME BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN WAYS THAT HE SEES VINCE. AND I HAVE CONCERNS THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO TAKE. WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO OVERSEE THE SPENDING OF THOSE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. WE CAN EASILY RECONVENE EVEN IF WE'RE NOT IN SESSION THIS FALL. TO EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY AND I'D LIKE TO BE A PARTNER TO THE GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND SPENDING THAT MONEY. THE SECOND CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT WE ALL OF KNOWLEDGE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE LARGE CUTS. TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR. AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER WHEN I SAY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WERE STILL PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY. AND WE DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CUTS WERE MAKING. OUR INCONGRUENCE WITH OUR VALUES AS CALIFORNIANS. NOW THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED A SORT OF CUTS IN THE BUDGET AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE REFINING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS I THINK SOME OF THOSE CUTS ARE APPROPRIATE SOME OF THEM I THINK WE ARE GOING TO AGREE OR NOT AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN DISTRICT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TO CLOSE THE BARSTOW VETERANS HOME. IN BARSTOW CALIFORNIA I WAS IN BARSTOW YESTERDAY THERE WAS A RALLY TO SAVE THE VETERANS HOME ALTHOUGH WAS OVER A HUNDRED DEGREES IN BARSTOW WE HAD OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE BY MY COUNT YET THAT REALLY EXPRESSING OUTRAGE. THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE. WHAT CONSIDER. THROWING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED ELDERLY VETERANS OUT OF THEIR HOME AND I HOPE THAT EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. THAT IS PART OF OUR VALUES AS CALIFORNIANS. THE THIRD THING THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUDGET WE PASS. SETS CALIFORNIA ON THE ROAD TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WE'VE HEARD SOME EXTREMELY DISTURBING TESTIMONY IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS IN OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE. THE ECONOMIC EXPERTS PROJECT THAT IF THE STARS ALIGNED WE COULD HAVE A RELATIVELY QUICK ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THIS RECESSION BUT THAT FROM AN EMPLOYMENT STANDPOINT. RECOVERY WILL TAKE A LONG TIME PERHAPS YEARS PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR YEARS THAT IS EXTREMELY SOBERING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE OUT OF WORK RIGHT NOW. SO MY QUESTION IS THIS BUDGET. GOING TO SET US ON THE ROAD TO BREAKING THOSE JOBS BACK AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET. THAT WE IN GOVERNMENT CANNOT CREATE JOBS WE LAY THE FOUNDATION BUT INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THE CREATORS OF THOSE JOBS THOSE OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE NEEDED GOING TO BE TO HIRE. OR CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK. AND I HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT IN THIS BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED RAISING TAXES ON BUSINESS OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. AND HE'S DOING IT IN A PROGRESSIVE A PARTICULARLY REGRESSIVE WAY. BY DISALLOWING THE NET OPERATING LOSS TO TAX DEDUCTION SO IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE GOING TO PENALIZE THE COMPANIES THAT ARE ALREADY DOING POORLY. HE'S ALSO GOING TO CAP THE AMOUNT OF TAX CREDITS THE BUSINESSES CAN TAKE. WHICH TO ME IS RENEGING ON THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE TO THOSE BUSINESSES WHEN WE PASS THOSE TAX CREDITS. AND THOSE PROMISES OF THE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN RELYING ON WHEN THEY PUT TOGETHER THE BUSINESS PLAN. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SHORE UP OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE RELYING ON THAT SYSTEM WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM IS HEALTHY. WE HAVE JUST TAKEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SHORE UP THAT SYSTEM WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A PLAN FOR PAYING TAT MONEY BACK. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN AND WE FAIL TO REPAIR THAT MONEY BACK. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DO AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE LAST RECESSION. AND IMPOSE PENALTIES ON EVERY BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA FOR EVERY EMPLOYEE THAT THEY HAVE. WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. THAT WAS BE PENALIZING BUSINESSES WHOSE. ARE ARE NOT AT FAULT AT ALL IN THIS PRICES BECAUSE WAS ACTION OF THE STATE THAT SHUT THEM DOWN. IT WAS AN ACTION OF THE STATE BUT TOOK THOSE LOANS. AT A NEEDS TO BE AN ACTION OF THE STATE THE REPAIRS THOSE LOANS SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION AND- IN THE BUDGET. AND THEN LASTLY. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THIS BUDGET SETS US ON A PATH. TO FUTURE SUCCESS IN OUR BUDGETS. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGREED ON THE FACT THAT THIS BUDGET DEFICIT IS NOT A SINGLE YOU'RE ABOUT. WE WILL BE FACING ANOTHER BUDGET DEFICIT NEXT YEAR PROBABLY OF SIX BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE EVEN WITH THE CUTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THIS YOU YEAR'S BUDGET THE YEAR AFTER THAT IT WILL BE EVEN WORSE PERHAPS AS MUCH AS SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST MERELY KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO BE HARDER FOR US NEXT YEAR. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING DOING A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ALONG THOSE LINES FIRST OF ALL HE'S PROPOSING OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF INTER FUND BORROWING SO WE'RE BORROWING MONEY FROM RESTRICTED FUNDS PUTTING IT IN THE GENERAL FUND AND PROMISING TO PAY IT BACK LATER WITH INTEREST. FOLKS THAT IS JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. ANOTHER THING THAT IS PROPOSING IS. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A BUDGET DEFERRALS. WHICH JUST MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PAY THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE. DO THIS YEAR ONE DAY INTO NEXT YEAR SO THAT WE CAN TELL EVERYBODY. THAT THEY WERE NEXT YEAR'S BILLS INSTEAD OF THIS YEAR'S BILLS. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S JUST GOING TO CREATE. A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR US NEXT YEAR. I THINK WE NEED TO BE THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM HERE. AND THE FACE THE FISCAL REALITIES. THAT EXISTED THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. BUT AS I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A DEDICATED. GROUP OF PEOPLE HERE. THAT WANT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIANS MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR. WE WILL NOW RECOGNIZE OR TWO WITNESSES. FOR THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE MISSED KEELEY BALSER. DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OF COURSE OUR LA- MR GAVE. PADDOCK AND WE WILL START WITH HIS BOSS WERE. GOOD AFTERNOON. SORRY ALL RIGHT I'LL START OVER I'M GOOD AFTERNOON I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY MY NAME IS KEENLY BOTHER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE- FOR IT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM I AM HONORED TO BE PRESENT HERE TODAY WITH YOU AT TO PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL AT THIS HISTORIC CONVENING AB. OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. JUST A FEW SHORT MONTHS AGO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN IT IS TODAY. WE HAD AN RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT LEVEL WE HAD A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF CONSECUTIVE JOB GROWTH AND ONE OUT OF SEVEN NEW U. S. JOBS WITH HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ENTER PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT FOR MANY YEARS. STRUCTURALLY BALLOT THIRD IN AN ACTING STRUCTURALLY BALANCED BUDGETS AND BUILDING UP RECORD RESERVES CALIFORNIA IS ON A MUCH STRONGER FISCAL POSITION THAN INTO RANGE OF PRIOR RECESSIONS. BUT SINCE THEN OVERNIGHT THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED OUR LIVES. AND HAS CAUSED A GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE US IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A RECESSION THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE WORSE THAN THE GREAT RECESSION. CALIFORNIA PERSONAL INCOME IS ALSO PROJECTED TO DECLINE THIS YEAR AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO RETURN TO TWENTY NINETEEN LEVELS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. ONE HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT WAS PROJECTED IN JANUARY. ONE OF THE MOST ALARMING ASPECTS OF THE EARLY MONTHS OF THIS RECESSION ARE THE UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS ESPECIALLY AMONG LOWER WAGE WORKERS. WHICH IS AMPLIFYING THE WAGE DISPARITY THAT EXISTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IT. SINCE FEBRUARY UNEMPLOYMENT HAS INCREASED UP FROM THREE POINT 9% IN FEBRUARY TWO FIFTEEN POINT 5% IN APRIL AND FURTHER INCREASES ARE EXPECTED LATER THIS QUARTER. JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT IN THE GREAT RECESSION IT TOOK THIRTY EIGHT MONTHS. TO REACH PEAK UNEMPLOYMENT'S DURING THE GREAT RECESSION- WHICH WAS TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT. SO THE STATE HAS REACHED THIS NEW RECORD PEAK AND JUST TWO SHORT MONTHS. THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FACING THE GREATEST HARDSHIPS IN OUR STATE LOW WAGE WORKERS. STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND SENIORS. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IS HAVING A MASSIVE IMPACT ON STATE REVENUES. SINCE JANUARY REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS LOWER. AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE IS EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE COSTS IN CASELOADS IN THE STATE'S CORE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. AND IS ALSO EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE COSTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO RESPONDING TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. OVERALL COMPARED TO OUR JANUARY ESTIMATES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS PROJECTED TO FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND STRUCTURAL DEFICITS OF NEARLY OF OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN EACH YEAR IN THE MULTI YEAR. DESPITE THIS AT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL THAT WAS PUT FORTH ON MAY FOURTEENTH- PROPOSES TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. IT ADDRESSES THAT THE FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT AND IT REDUCES THE OUT YOUR DEFICIT THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THEM BY IT BUT IT REDUCES THEM BY APPROXIMATELY 60% IT DOES THIS BY ALSO PROTECTING PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S CORE VALUES IT INVESTS IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION IT CREATES A NEW FUNDING OBLIGATION FOR SCHOOLS TO ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY. OF OUR OF SCHOOL FOR FUNDING. IT PRESERVES CHILDCARE SLOTS IT EXPANDS ACCESS TO CHILDCARE TO FRONTLINE WORKERS. IT ALSO MAINTAINS OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM OUR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN ANTICIPATION THAT MANY DISPLACED WORKERS OFTEN RETURN TO HIGHER EDUCATION. AB WHEN THEY'VE LOST A JOB. AND THEN FINALLY THE BUDGET SUPPORTS CALIFORNIANS FACING THE GREATEST HARDSHIPS- LAST YEAR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. WE WERE ABLE TO EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT THAT PROVIDES ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS TO WORKING FAMILIES WITH INCOMES LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND INCLUDING A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR AB AT A CREDIT FOR WORKERS WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX THAT IS MAINTAINED IN THIS BUDGET- AS ARE THE GRANTS. AT LEVELS THE CURRENT GRANT LEVELS FOR BOTH CAL WORKS AND SS I SS P. WE ALSO PRIORITIZE IN THIS BUDGET AB PROTECTING THE CURRENT ELIGIBILITY OF THE STATE'S MEDICAL PROGRAM AND ALSO AS- AT THE COVERED CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE. THE EXPANDED SUBSIDIES THE HISTORIC EXPANDED SUBSIDIES THAT WERE ENACTED LAST YEAR TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN AT THE FACT FOR A FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX OR SIX 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE TO SWITCH LIGHTS ON. I AM I AM CURRENTLY ON LET'S SAY SLIDE. SORRY TH NERVOUS. AND THE BALLOT SOLUTION SLIDE IF WE COULD GO THERE THAT BE GREAT. THE MAYOR REVISION PROPOSES BALANCE POLICE AND. OUR RIGHTS TO MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET THE MAY REVISION DOES PROPOSE I'M SOLUTIONS IN SIX CATEGORIES FIRST AT THE VERY FIRST ITEM IS CANCELING EXPANSIONS THAT WERE- PROPOSED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. I'M AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NUMBERS PRODUCED BY THE LA- AND BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE BIG DIFFERENCES WE'RE DRIVING OFF OF THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THAT'S HOW WE TYPICALLY REVISED- IN THE MAY REVISION IS OFF OF THE JANUARY PROPOSAL SO THE FIRST SET OF SOLUTIONS ARE REDUCTIONS- ARE RELATED T CANCELING EXPANSIONS OF PROGRAMS THAT WERE PROPOSED. IN JANUARY THIS CATEGORY ALSO DOES CANCEL SOME EXPANSIONS THAT WERE PROPOSED IN TWENTY NINE THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THAT HAD NOT STARTED YET BUT GIVEN THE VERY CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES- WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MERITED THIS TIME. WE ALSO PROPOSING TO USE THE HISTORIC RESERVES THAT THE STATE HAS BUILT UP OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. I'M ABOUT SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND THE OVERALL RAINY DAY FUND IS ESTIMATED TO BE SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION AND SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION OF THAT IS PROPOSED TO BE USED TO THIS YEAR. AND SOME ADDITIONAL RESERVES IN THE SAFETY NET A RESERVE FUND AS WELL AS RESERVES- THAT WERE PART OF THE PUBLIC. SCHOOLS AS A RESERVE. AND THERE IS ALSO AB PROPOSAL- TO DO SOME INTERNAL BORROWING THESE THEIR BORROWING AND BORROWING THAT WE DO FOR M. INTERNALLY AND WE HAVE DONE IN PRIOR. DOWNTURNS FROM SPECIAL FUNDS IN FACT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACTUALLY PAID OFF ALL OF THE INTERNAL BORROWING THAT HAD HAPPENED FROM PRIOR RECESSIONS. BUT THIS BUDGET DOES RELY ON SOME BORROWING- BECAUSE THE MAGNITUDEOF THIS CRISIS IS SO GREAT WE ALSO PROPOSE SOME TRANSFERRED SOME FOR SOME SPECIAL FUNDS- AS WELL AS DEFERRALS IN THE AREA OF SCHOOLS AND I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPTH. ABOUT THE SCHOOL FUNDING PROPOSAL IN A LITTLE BIT. FINALLY I AM WE ALSO PROPOSE SOME NEW TIME LIMITED REVENUES- THE REVENUES THE TWO MAJOR PROPOSALS- THAT TO AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED- WERE ARE THE- SUSPENSION OF NET OPERATING LOSSES. AND ALSO THE- CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF TAX CREDIT THAT CAN BE TAKEN IN ANY ONE GIVEN YEAR TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. BOTH OF THESE CAN ALSO BE SEEN BY SOME AS BORROWING BECAUSE AND FOR ALL OF THESE TAX CREDITS WOULD CONTINUE TO STAY. ON THAT THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEETS AND WOULD BE ABLE TO BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS BUT THEY ARE SUSPENDED IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY FACING WITH ITS BUDGET. THAT'S ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION ON THAT WERE ALSO PROPOSING TO STRATEGICALLY USE THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED EARLIER THIS YEAR FROM THE CARES ACT PRIMARILY- AND THOSE ARE ALSO BEING USED TO- HELP TO SOLVE THE BUDGET AND ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY COSTS. RELATED TO THE COVERT NINETEEN RECESSION OUR COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND THEN FINALLY- THE BUDGET IS BALANCED ON A TRIGGER A TRIGGER THAT ASSUMES THAT ADD THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT IF THE FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED. IT DOES- THE PROPOSED BASE REDUCTIONS TO PROGRAMS. I JUST WANT TO TAKE  LOOK AT A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT THESE REDUCTIONS THESE ARE THESE ARE THESE ARE REAL REDUCTIONS THEY HAVE REAL IMPACTS TO TEACHERS STATE EMPLOYEES. STUDENTS AND SENIORS. BUT THEY ARE NECESSARY GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REVENUE SHORTFALL AND IN THE ABSENCE OF FEDERAL FUNDS. TO BALANCE THE BUDGET WHICH IS A RECORD CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT. INTO A BIRDS THE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY THAT COMES. WITH A CASH CRISIS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO AVERT THOSE REDUCTIONS. I'M MOVING ON TO THE RAINY DAY FLY READY DAY FUND SLIDE- THE MAY REVISION AGAIN IS BALANCED IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT IT DOES HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT TO DO REMAIN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS INCLUDING SIX AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSED AN ESTIMATED DEFICIT IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO NEARLY TWELVE BILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND OVER SIXTEEN BILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND WITH OUT ACTIONS PROPOSED IN THE ME REVISION THESE DEFICITS WOULD BE OVER FORTY BILLION IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. GIVEN THE FISCAL CRISIS FACING THE STATE AT THAT MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE ALL OF THE RAINY DAY FUND OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. BUT WE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A ONE YEAR PROBLEM THOSE RESERVES ARE PROPOSED TO BE USED- OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. MOVING ON TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING ALLOCATION FIVE THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IS ALSO VERY FORTUNATE WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE NEARLY TEN BILLION DOLLARS- FROM THE FEDERAL CARES ACT THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO DIRECT IN THE MAY REVISION- AND THESE FUNDS MUST BE USED FOR COVERT NINETEEN RELATED COSTS. ATTHE FIRST ALLOCATION IS FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION FOR OUR K. TWELVE STUDENTS TO ADDRESS THE LEARNING LOSS- THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH THIS THE CLOSURE OF OUR SCHOOLS- THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION AT THE STATE LEVEL TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THE FAMILY'S HIT HARDEST. ONE POINT THREE BILLION FOR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OTHER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS AND THEN FINALLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR CITIES- TO ADDRESS THE COVERT NINETEEN RELATED- COSTS IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY. MOVING ON TO THE SCHOOL SLIDE. THE MASSIVE DECLINE IN REVENUES- OF OVER FORTY ONE BILLION IS CAUSING THE PROPOSITION NINETY ACRE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE TO DECLINE BY NINETEEN BILLION. THE MAY REVISION MITIGATES THIS DECLINE IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS IN THE SHORT TERM AND PROPOSES A NEW OBLIGATION TO SCHOOLS TO ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY OF SCHOOL FUNDING. SPECIFICALLY THE MAY REVISION IS PROPOSING TO ESTABLISH A NEW DEDICATED. FUNDING SOURCE OF ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES ANNUALLY UNTIL SCHOOL FUNDING REACHES FUNDS. CURRENTLY K. FOURTEEN SCHOOLS RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY HELP THE SCHOOL FUNDING RECOVER MORE QUICKLY AND WILL BE CRITICAL TO STABILIZE IN AND MAINTAINING THE PROGRESS THAT THE STATE HAS MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE AND IMPROVING STUDENT OUT IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL AT THEIR PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION THAT HELP TO MITIGATE AD THAT DECLINE IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. THE FIRST ARE THE TEMPORARY REVENUES THAT I JUST SPOKE ABOUT THEY PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND BENEFIT TO THE SCHOOL FUNDING. TO SCHOOL FUNDING ALSO AT THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION THAT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS THIS YEAR. LAST YEAR WE TOOK AB HISTORIC SURPLUSES AND WERE ABLE TO MAKE SOME SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO BOTH HERS AND STIRRERS. I'M BE FOR HALF OF THE STATE AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ABOUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION OF THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR LONG TERM. LIABILITIES THE BUT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ACCELERATE THAT- SAVINGS AND PROVIDE MORE IMMEDIATE RELIEF IN BOTH THE BUDGET YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE. I'M ALSO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL RESERVE IS BEING USED TO MITIGATE IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THEN FINALLY- DEFERRALS ARE BEING INSTITUTED DEFERRALS HAVE ROUTINELY BEEN USED IN PRIOR RECESSIONS- THEY DO ALLOW DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN PROGRAMS BUT DO REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO GO. OUT ON THE MARKET AND BORROW OR USE OTHER FUNDS THAT THEY CAN ADD TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS- BUT WE WOULD THINK THAT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DECLINE IN THE GUARANTEE THAT THESE DEFERRALS ARE NECESSARY- FOR PROGRAMS TO BE MAINTAINED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND TO A JET AND ESPECIALLY SINCE SCHOOLS ARE FACING. LARGE CHANGES IN AND CHANGING AND ADJUSTING THE CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION TO DEAL WITH THE NEW REALITY OF A COVERT NINETEEN WORLD. MOVING TO THE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY- THIS BUDGET PROPOSES REDUCTIONS TO NEARLY ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNOR STATE OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. NONESSENTIAL TRAVEL IS CANCELED- CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE NOT DEEMED NECESSARY ARE HALTED IN ALL ONLY ESSENTIAL VACANCIES ARE BEING FILLED. THE COVERT NINETEEN THE PANDEMIC HAS DISRUPTED STATE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS FORCING THE STATE TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO ADOPT TO ADAPT AND DELIVER CORE SERVICES. AND THIS BY- A REVISION PROPOSES TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK THE WAY THE STATE DELIVERS MANY SERVICES AS WE RETURN TO NORMAL TIMES. I HAVE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT WAYS TO RETHINK OFFICE SPACE AND SHRINK THE STATE'S REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO OVER TIME AND ALSO BRING YOU MORE SERVICES ONLINE I'M TO INCREASE CONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCIES AT THE STATE. JOB CREATION SIDE ENTREPRENEURS WHO RUN SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND WHILE THE FEDERAL PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED OVER SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN A COMBINATION OF GRANTS AND LOANS INTO THE STATE. WE ESTIMATE THAT ONLY ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES WERE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. TO HELP FILL THAT GAP THE MAY REVISION DOES PROPOSE A HUNDRED MILLION% DOLLARS FOR ADDITIONAL SMALL BUSINESS LOANS FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION- PROGRAM. I WOULD WE ALSO PROPOSED TO MAINTAIN A TAX CUT THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY- BUDGET TO- ELIMINATE THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX FOR NEW SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SUPPORT JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND THE ADMINISTRATION WALK WILL BE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. AND SUPPORT THE CREATION OF GOOD PAYING JOBS SPECIFICALLY AROUND SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY INCREASING HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE STATE AN INCREASE IN OUR INVESTMENTS IN HUMAN AND PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. DEFICIT SLIDE PLEASE. I'M GONNA WRAP IT UP HERE AND THESE ARE REALLY UNCERTAIN TIMES FOR PEOPLE AND HOUSEHOLDS DO THAT DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND RECESSION THE EFFECTS OF THE RECESSION ARE MASSIVE ON PEOPLE AND THE STATE'S BUDGET. AND IN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATE'S HISTORY WE KNOW THAT THE NILE AND DELAY. LIMITS BUDGETARY CHOICES. AND THE EXTRA CASH CRISIS THAT INJECTS MORE UNCERTAINTY RIGHT WHEN PEOPLE NEED. THE GOVERNMENT THE MOST. DUE TO PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT THE STATE IS FACING THIS CRISIS IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO CONTEND WITH THESE CHALLENGES. BUT BALANCING THE STATE'S CURRENT SPENDING NEEDS. AND HOW TO PAY FOR THEM WILL BE DIFFICULT. THIS YEAR AND THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND EVEN UNDER THE MAY REVISION DEFICITS REMAIN. THE BUDGET ENACTED THIS YEAR NEEDS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TO REDUCING THE STRUCTURAL SHORTFALLS TO AVOID THE FINANCIAL THE YEARS OF FINANCIAL DISTRESS THAT PRIOR RECESSIONS HAVE BROUGHT TO THE STATE. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE CAPACITY TO REALLY MITIGATE THE MOST DIFFICULT REDUCTION STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS. IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AND CALIFORNIA HAS REQUESTED ONE TRILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERALLY FOR ALL STATE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE NATION TO MAINTAIN CORE SERVICES OF GOV THE COURT BACK FOR SERVICES OF GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE PRUDENT FISCAL DECISIONS BUT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CRISIS. FOR THE STATE AND THE ENTIRE NATION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTION. AND I WILL AND ABOUT HERE TODAY AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO MR PANIC. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE SPEAKER INTO THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR FOR INVITING OUR OFFICE TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S IMPORTANT HEARING. IT AS A REMINDER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IS YOUR NONPARTISAN FISCAL AND POLICY ADVISER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO POINT OUT THAT IN RECENT WEEKS IF YOU WERE TO GO TO OUR WEBSITE AT THE LA- DOT CA DOT GOV YOU WOULD SEE THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED TO NEW LANDING PAGES ONE IS DEDICATED TO OUR COVERT NINETEEN RELATED ANALYSES. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS OUR NEIGHBOR VISION ANALYSIS. AND I'D ALSO JUST LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REMIND YOU THAT WE ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL BRIEFINGS TO YOU. ON THOSE OR ANY OTHER TOPICS THAT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO YOU. TODAY IT WOULD. BE NICE MY REMARKS INTO TWO BROAD CATEGORIES. THE FIRST IS I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A SOMEWHAT DESCRIPTIVE OVERVIEW OF HOW ARE OFF HOW ARE OFFICE VIEWS THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION. AND THEN SECOND- OFFER SOME SUMMARY OF- ELADIO COMMENTS IN AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF IT. SO HOPEFULLY WE HAVE THE SLIDE DECK AND IF YOU MOVE TO THE FIRST PAGE. I'LL GET RIGHT TO IT HERE WE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION AND THIS IS PRESENTED. REFLECTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISIONS SO THIS IS INCLUSIVE OF THE FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR DECLINE IN REVENUE SINCE JANUARY DECLINE IN THE REVENUE ESTIMATE SINCE JANUARY THAT- THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE JUST MENTIONED. AND THEN IT ALSO INCORPORATES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED- CHOICES AND THE CHOICES HE MAKES TO PROPOSED TO CLOSE TO THE BUDGET GAP THAT RESULTS FROM THAT DECLINE IN REVENUE. MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE SLIDE TO- THIS SLIDE ILLUSTRATES BOTH THE BUDGET PROBLEM AND THE VERY THE GOVERNOR'S MIX OF PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. FOR HOW TO ADDRESS THE BUDGET PROBLEMS. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TABLE AT THE FAR BUT THE FAR LEFT THE LARGE COLUMN REPRESENTS THE FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BUDGET FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM. AND THEN AS YOU MOVE RIGHT ACROSS THE SLIDE THE SMALLER BARS REPRESENT HOW WE CATEGORIZE THE DIFFERENT PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FROM THE GOVERNOR. TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BIT OF- PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THE FAR UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER HAS USE FEDERAL FUNDS WE COUNT ABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION IN THAT CATEGORY AND THAT'S THE SMALLEST BAR ON THIS PARTICULAR. PRESENTATION OF THE MATERIAL AND IT'S ABOUT 7% OF THE TOTAL SOLUTIONS. THE LARGEST BAR ON HERE IS THE ADJUSTMENT TO K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION SPENDING. AND IT REPRESENTS ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OR 28% OF THE TOTAL PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. I'LL SPEAK TO THAT I'M IN A BIT MORE IN A MOMENT. THE NEXT SLIDE PAGE THREE. IS REALLY THE SAME INFORMATION THAT IS ON THE PREVIOUS TABLE BUT IT'S JUST THE NUMERICAL BACK UP SO I WON'T SPEND TIME ON THIS SLIDE BUT I WANTED TO PROVIDE IT. FOR YOUR REFERENCE. SO MOVING ON TO PAGE FOUR REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE QUE THIS IS FOR A DECADE TELL KINDERGARTEN TO TWELFTH GRADE- EDUCATION PROPOSAL IN PARTICULAR. SO IS- AS WAS MENTIONED TO ME A REVISION DOES PROPOSED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE- AND THIS WOULD ABSENT ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD RESULT IN ABOUT A SIX BILLION DOLLAR YEAR OVER YEAR DECLINE IN FUNDING FOR THE- K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. FROM THE CURRENT YEAR TO THE BUDGET YEAR. HOWEVER THE NAY REVISION DOES INCLUDE VARIOUS OFFSETTING. PROPOSALS THAT WOULD MITIGATE THE THOSE REDUCTIONS I WAS ALREADY MENTIONED BUT THESE INCLUDE THE USE OF ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS. AND ALSO THE USE OF DEFERRALS WHICH ENABLE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SPEND IT AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE.THE NET EFFECT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHANGES FROM YEAR TO YEAR. ACTUALLY K. TWELVE SPENDING IS RELATIVELY FLAT FROM THE CURRENT YEAR TO THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES THIS NEW SUPPLEMENTAL OBLIGATION THAT WOULD BE PAID TO THE SCHOOLS OVER THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THE FIFTY GOING TO PAGE FIVE. THIS SLIDE SUMMARIZES THE CORVETTE NINETEEN RELATED FUNDING. BOTH THE AMOUNTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPENDED AND IN ADDITION THE PROPOSED AMOUNT OF SPENDING IN THE MAY REVISION SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TABLE THE TOP PORTION SUMS TO ABOUT TWO POINT TWO BILLION THOSE ARE THE FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPENDED AND THEN AT THE LOWER HALF OF THE TABLE THIS IS WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION. THE DIRECT RESPONSE EXPENDITURES FOR THREE POINT FIVE BILLION- WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION AND INITIALLY WE HAD VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THOSE. PROPOSALS ENTAILED. ALTHOUGH WE RECENTLY RECEIVED A FINANCE LETTER THAT PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE. AND THEN YOU'LL SEE HERE THAT THE GIRL IS PROPOSING THIS COVERT NINETEEN CONTINGENCY FUND THAT WOULD BE A TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR FINE. AND THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO USE CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE EXPENDITURES FROM THAT FUND. SO MOVING ON TO SORT OF THE LA- ASSESSMENT OF THE PACKAGE AND THE SITUATION TO BEGIN WITH. I WOULD NOTE THAT ON MAY EIGHTH OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED A- SPRING FISCAL OUTLOOK. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL FOR OUR OFFICE WE TYPICALLY PUBLISH AN OUTLOOK IT IN NOVEMBER BUT USUALLY NOT ONE IN THE SPRING BUT GIVEN HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE JANUARY WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF THE BUDGETARY BASS LINE. FOR YOU EVEN IN ADVANCE OF RECEIVING THE MAY REVISION. AND CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY OUT IN THE ECONOMY AND IN IN THE WORLD IN GENERAL WE DEVELOPED OUR- SPRING OUTLOOK OR FISCAL OUTLOOK USING TWO SCENARIOS. ONE WE WERE CALLING THE U. SHAPED RECESSION WHERE THERE'S A DOWNTURN IN AND IN THE COMING MONTHS THE ECONOMY EXPERIENCES A STRONGER KIND OF MORE ROBUST TYPE OF RECOVERY. AND IN THAT SCENARIO THE STATE WOULD BE FACING AN EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM. THE OTHER SCENARIO WE CONSIDERED WAS SLIGHTLY PESSIMISTIC IT'S WHAT WE CALL THE L. SHAPE SCENARIO WHERE THE ECONOMY WOULD GO DOWN AND THEN HAVE A MORE PROTRACTED KIND OF A SLOWER TYPE OF RECOVERY. AND IN THAT IN THAT SCENARIO THE BUDGET PROBLEM IS THIRTY ONE BILLION. NOW IN BOTH OF THESE SCENARIOS THE MAIN DRIVER OF THE BUDGET PROBLEM IS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN REVENUES. IN ARE YOU SHAPE SCENARIO IT'S A TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE DECLINE FROM JANUARY ESTIMATES. AND IN THE- SHAPE SCENARIO IT'S A THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE DECLINE FROM THE JANUARY ESTIMATES. AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE DECLINE IN OUR BILL SHEA SCENARIO IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMILAR IN THE BIG PICTURE TO THE GOVERNOR'S. FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE DECLINE IN THE MAY REVISION. AND AS THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE JUST MENTIONED THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IN OUR- ULTIMATE BUDGET PROBLEM ESTIMATES HAVE TO DO WITH HOW WE MEASURE THE STATE'S EXPENDITURE BASE. SO MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE. YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU. THINK THE STATE INYO DEFINED IT AS A THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM OR A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM PROBLEM. THE MAIN MESSAGE OF OUR SPRING OUTLOOK WAS THAT. WE THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER USING A MIX OF PROPOSALS A MIX SOLUTION TO CLOSE THIS BUDGET PROBLEM. AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. HE PROVIDES. A PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES A PRETTY WELL BALANCED MIX OF SOLUTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. THE WE THINK THAT YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE TWO SO THAT THOSE PARTICULAR COMPONENTS BETTER REFLECT YOUR PRIORITIES. NOW A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC. POINTS I WOULD WANT TO MENTION HERE. ON THE PROPOSED REVENUE SOLUTIONS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING THAT THE STATE AUGMENT ITS REVENUES BY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION THE TWO MAIN COMPONENTS OF THAT HAVE TO DO WITH SUSPENDING THE NET OPERATING LOSSES FOR BUSINESSES FOR THREE YEARS AND PUTTING A LIMIT ON THE TAX CREDITS THAT CAN BE TAKEN. IN IN THOSE IN THOSE YEARS. NOW INSTANCE SUMS IN ONE SENSE THIS IS PERHAPS MORE APPEALING THAN A BROAD BASED TAX INCREASE BECAUSE GENERALLY IT'S VIEWED AS SORT OF AN ACCELERATION OF TAXES THAT WOULD BE PAID ANYWAY. SO IT'S NOT REALLY VIEWED IN SOME SOME ANALYSES WOULD SUGGEST IT'S NOT AS BURDENSOME AS A BROAD BASED TAX INCREASE. ON THE OTHER HAND. THE CORPORATION TAX IS KNOWN FOR BEING VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THE SOLUTIONS RELY ON THE REVENUE FROM THIS SOURCE IT BECOMES MORE RISKY TO RELY ON THAT SOURCE OF REVENUE. IN ADDITION WE THINK THAT THE MAY REVISION MIGHT ESTIMATE THESE THEREVENUE THAT WOULD COME FROM THESE ACTIONS TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH. SO COULD BE SOMEWHAT OPTIMISTIC IN OUR JUDGMENT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SPENDING REDUCTIONS WE THINK SOME ARE PRETTY WELL TARGETED OTHERS HOWEVER ARE RELATIVELY BLIND THERE HAVE KIND OF A AN ACROSS THE BOARD QUALITY TO THEM. SO I'M THINKING OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGET AND YOU JUST- BRANCH AND EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION ALL OF THOSE ARE SUBJECT 210% REDUCTIONS WE THINK YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER A MORE TARGETED APPROACH IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS. MOVING TO PAGE EIGHT I WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE MULTIPLE YEAR- BUDGET OUTLOOK HEARD BUDGET CONDITION AND A KEY MESSAGE AARON IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT THE KEY MESSAGE HERE IS THAT UNDER ANY SCENARIO THE STATE WOULD APPEAR TO BE FACING IS KIND OF A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THERE'S AN ONGOING BUDGET PROBLEM. AND WELL THE GOVERNOR DOES MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS FRONT IT WOULD REDUCE THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM OVER THAT. FOR OVER THE FORECAST YEARS. IT STILL WOULD LEAVE THE STATE UNDER THE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS IT WOULD LEAD TO STAY WITH A LARGE DEFICIT IN THE FINAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. NO PART OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF THAT LARGE SIGNIFICANT NEW SUPPLEMENTAL OBLIGATION THAT WOULD BE TO THE SCHOOLS. THAT WOULD ADD TEN POINT ONE BILLION TO THE STATE SPENDING THROUGH IN THE YEARS OF THE- OF THE OUTLOOK HORIZON. IN ADDITION THERE ARE SOME COST SHIFTS IN THE BUDGET SOME OF THESE INCLUDE CHANGES TO THE TO THE- PENT SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS THAT YOU PROVIDED LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET. AND THEY THAT THE CHANGES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE EFFECT OF ACHIEVING SOME SAVINGS IN THE NEAR TERM BUT AT THE EXPENSE O CREATING HIGHER COSTS OVER THE LONGER TERM AND THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO. A LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL ISSUE. NOW WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERAL FUNDING WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR POLICY MAKERS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE- FEDERAL AID AND TO THE EXTENT WE GET IT THAT COULD HELP THE PROBLEM- BUT IN IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT EVEN IF. FOURTH EVEN IF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS FORTHCOMING. IT WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED TERM IN NATURE ONE OR TWO YEARS AT THE MOST. AND IN THAT CASE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ONCE AGAIN FACED WITH A STRUCTURAL ISSUE WHEN THAT FUNDING BEGINS TO PHASE OUT. SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE THINK YOU'LL WANT TO BE KEEPING IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER THE BUDGET. FINALLY ON THE LAST PAGE OF MY PRESENTATION I WANTED TO. PROVIDE A WORD ON THIS THE ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT. YOUR NECK JANUARY BUDGET THE GOVERNOR HAD A LOT OF PROPOSALS AND HE'S MADE CHANGES TO MANY OF THOSE PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE'S ALSO RETAINING SOME BIG SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A NEW DEPARTMENT AND THE SIGNIFICANT REORGANIZATION OF EXISTING DEPARTMENTS. NOW SOME OF THESE IDEAS MAY HAVE MERIT. BUT THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPLEX MULTI YEAR UNDERTAKINGS IN MANY MANY INSTANCES. AND CONSIDERING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS ON RECESS FOR PART OF THE SPRING. AND YOU ARE UNABLE TO HOLD THE SAME LEVEL OF HEARINGS THAT YOU WOULD IN A NORMAL YEAR. WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER DEFERRING ACTING ON THOSE ITEMS MAYBE INTO THE POLICY PROCESS OR EVEN A SUBSEQUENT BUDGET YOU. YOU HAVE A FULLY CONSIDERED THEM. AND THEN LAST WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROPOSALS FOR THE COVERT NINETEEN SPENDING. WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE DEGREE OF LATITUDE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WE APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO. BE NIMBLE AND ITS RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT THE PROPOSED USE OF THE CONTROL SECTION PROVISIONS RISK UNDERMINING THIS THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY AND ITS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OVERSIGHT FUNCTION. AT A MINIMUM WE THINK YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING THE LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THESE CONTROL SECTION PROPOSALS. AND WE REALLY DO VIEW THIS AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE CORE ISSUE OF THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AND FOR THAT REASON WE THINK IT WARRANTS YOUR ATTENTION. SO WITH THAT I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU. BUT MISSED PRODUCT OF FIRST LET ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING NOW WE ARE GOING TO BE GOING TO MEMBER QUESTIONS MEMBERS WILL EACH BE ALLOWED A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES INTO FOUR MINUTES WILL INCLUDE THE TIME TO MAKE YOUR STATEMENT AS WELL AS THE TIME TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED SO MY ADVICE WOULD BE IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO A STATEMENT AND A QUESTION TO START WITH YOUR STATEMENT. AND THEN ALLOW ON THE ANSWER QUESTIONS ALLOW THEIR QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED MEMBERS WHO ARE AFTER DEATH PLEASE RETURN MY EX MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT AT THEIR DESKS IN THE BACK PLEASE LET US SERGEANT NOTE THAT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO BE GETTING ME THAT- THOSE NAMES IN ORDER- I'M GONNA DO MY BEST TO RECOGNIZE PEOPLE AS YOU RAISE YOUR HAND A RAZOR MIKE I AM WOULD ALLOW MISTER OBERNOLTE- THE OPENING REMARKS AS WELL AS IN THE FIRST QUESTIONS THAT HE MAY HAVE. I HAD A COUPLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF I COULD START. BY THE FIRST QUESTION IS I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE COMMENTS THAT MISTER PATRICK I JUST MADE REGARDING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND TO BE CLEAR WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WITH THE GOVERNOR. BUT ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S ASKING FOR EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO ALLOCATE. SOURCES OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I'M WONDERING THE SPECIFICALLY THE CONTROLLING WHICH IS SECTIONS ELEVEN POINT. EIGHTY SIX ELEVEN POINT NINETY AND THE MAY REVISED WHAT. DOES THE DEPARTMENT SEEK TO ACCOMPLISH THERE THAT YOU DON'T FEEL COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. YES SO I MEAN AND SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE CONTROL SECTIONS AROUND THE FEDERAL FUNDS- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE. STAFF ABOUT HOW TO MODIFY THOSE TO INSURE THAT THERE'S OVERSIGHT. THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY AROUND THE CORONA VIRUS RELIEF FUND- IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AND FLEXIBILITY INCLUDING THE WEEK OF THE BUDGET RELEASE THERE WAS EVEN NEW- GUIDANCE THAT STILL HAS NOT BEEN MEMORIALIZED IN ANY KIND OF WRITTEN FORMAT. THAT WE COULD UTILIZE THE CORONA VIRUS REALLY FUNDS TO ACTUALLY- MATCH THE FEMALE AT THE FEMALE AS THE STAFFORD ACT EXPENDITURES SO. GIVEN THAT WE WEREN'T REALLY COMPLETELY SURE ABOUT HOW WE WOULD ALLOCATE THOSE MONIES WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE GUIDANCE FROM THE U. S. TREASURY THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HOW IT NEEDS TO BE SPENT- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS OF SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY. I THINK WE'VE ALREADY LOOKED AT MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A NOTIFICATION PERIOD PROP- AT NOTIFICATION A BUILT IN TO THOSE AFFECTS. SO THAT THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THAT THAT THAT THAT ONE PIECE- THE CROWN OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT'S HAS SUCH A DIFFERENT ARC THANMANY EMERGENCIES. YOU KNOW A- EARTHQUAKE A FLOOD TIRES WITH EXPERIENCE THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THEY USUALLY ARE HAPPENS OVER THE PERIOD OF THE DAY ARE YOU DAYS OR- A COP WEEKS THIS IS A DISASTER AT THAT THAT SPENDING MUCH LONGER AND SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH IN A LOT OF GOOD CONVERSATIONS. OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS ABOUT HOW AND AS- HOW THAT THE HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT AND HOW IT FRANKLY IT IS STILL. REALLY THE SAME. EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNOR- THE ACTIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN AND ALSO WHAT I HAVE ARE. AND HAITIANS THAT PROVIDE. ALL BASED ON STATUTE AND SPECIFICALLY THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT THEN HE CONTROL. SECTIONS THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN THE BUDGET THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACCESS GOVERN. THE WRITTEN Q. THAT WE MAKE. ALLEGED WHICH ARE ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED. BUT WE ALSO HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU KNOW AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MORE EXECUTIVE ACTION HERE THAN MAYBE AND PRIOR LONG EMERGENCIES. LIKE OF LIKE THE DROUGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY DID LAST FOR SEVERAL YEARS- BUT IT WAS IT WAS STILL MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED THAN THIS EMERGENCY IS. SO A LOT OF REALLY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I THINK ARE CAUSING A LOT OF- GOOD. DEBATE BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD MAINTAIN THAT THE POWERS OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACTOR ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL. TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ACTION SWIFTLY TO. PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND- PUBLIC SAFE. AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT AND THAT THE DEBATE AND BALANCE THAT I THINK- WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ON. AS WE PUT TOGETHER THIS BUDGET THANK YOU VOTE I AGREE YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THAT THIS IS THE START OF A DISCUSSION. AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO PRESERVE OUR ABILITY. TO EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT WE ARE EXPECTED TO. ABA A SECOND QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU REGARDS THE TITLE TWELVE LOANS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS RECENTLY TAKEN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SHORE UP OUR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. SO WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S THINKING ABOUT HOW THOSE LOANS ARE GOING TO BE REPAID I KNOW THAT THE CARE IS ACT MAKES THOSE LOANS. FREE FOR THE TIME BEING WHICH IS YOU CAN WHICH IS HELPFUL BUT IT DOES NOT HELP US PAYING THAT ACT AND SO I'M WONDERING WHAT HOW THE YEAH I KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE ARE TRACKING VERY CLOSELY AND THAT. WE'RE VERY CAN ABOUT- AND THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYMENT. PEOPLE ON A PLANE EMPLOYMENT IS REALLY AS- AT NUMBER- SOMETHING THAT THE STATE HAS NOT SEEN BEFORE. UNDERTHE LAST RECESSION WE DID HAVE TO TAKE OUT MULTIPLE TENS OF BILLIONS OF LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE DID THAT. AND WE DID REPAY THAT- OVER TIME. AND THOSE INTEREST COSTS- WOULD IT WORK OUT BORN BY THE STATE. LATE CHECK A CLEAR THOUGH WITHOUT GOING INTO COLLOQUY RIGHT AND THAT HAS A WE REPEATED. THE STATE REPAIRS RIGHT AT THE EMPLOYERS OF THE STATE RIGHT- FORCED RIGHT PAY THE PRINCIPAL THE SAME TIME. THERE IS A MECHANISM IT'S CALLED THE FOOD THAT. THAT IS THAT AS- BUSINESSES THAT. THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN WHICH THAT THE LOAN IS OUTSTANDING- ONE THING THAT WAS IN THE CARE IS ACCESS. THAT THE EXTENSION OF THE INTEREST FREE UNTIL DECEMBER IS ABSOLUTELY HELPFUL. WE WOULD LIKE A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF INTEREST FREE LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS TIME GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY. STRESS ON ALL AND EMPLOYMENT SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY INCLUDING CALIFORNIA- WE WILL BE WORKING THERE IS A DELAY IN TERMS OF THE TIME IN WHICH IT REQUIRES THE STATE TO PAY BACK- WITH INTEREST THOSE LOANS- BUT- THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT. THAT THAT IT WILL BE EITHER ON THE GENERAL FUND OR IN YEARS PAST THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE INTO. BY THE- PAYMENTS THE SOME AT. FIND I'M SO THOSE WILL BE TYPES OF THINGS THAT THE STATE WILL BE. WITH FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL. AND ALSO BE MINDFUL OF THE IMPACT ON BUSINESSES AROUND SO THAT THAT'S THE INTEREST AND THE PRINCIPAL. AND THE PRINCIPAL IS IT'S ALL IS ALL A PART OF THAT THE TAX THE TAXES ON BUSINESSES THAT THAT SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM RIGHT SO DOES THE STATE INTEND TO PAY THAT BACK OR IS THE INTENT WELL THERE IS A- PROPOSAL IN THE MAY REVISION. DO THAT AT THIS POINT POINT WE'RE TAKING LOANS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO MAKE- UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS FOR- BUT- AND WE WILL BE ADVOCATING FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF INTEREST. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DEBT THAT WILL BE- TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE HOPEFUL OF CONTINUING. SHARES FOR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FIRST AND WHEN ASKED DOCTOR ARAMBULA TO BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER CARE TANG AND MEMBERS I WANTED TO START MY COMMENTS OFF TODAY BY RECOGNIZING THE INCREDIBLE LOSS OF LIFE THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AN INCALCULABLE LOSS AS THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS CALLED IT IN SUNDAY'S PAPER. AS A DOCTOR I KNOW THAT EVEN ONE LIFE IS A LIFE IS ONE LIFE LOST IS ONE LIFE TOO MANY. NEARLY OVERNIGHT WE LEARNED THAT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR BEHAVIORS. AND TO DO THAT WE DID IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD MINIMIZE FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE. I AM PROUD THAT OUR COMMUNITIES TOOK DECISIVE ACTION TO FLATTEN THE CURVE AND THAT WE AS THE STATE AS WELL AS OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TOOK SWIFT ACTION TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. IS THAT NOW WE SHOULD BE THE ENTRUSTED PEOPLE BY THE PUBLIC TO HELP TO PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE. THE FORESIGHT AND THE ASSISTANCE THAT IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES EMERGE STRONGER THAN EVER. THE HARSH REALITY IS THAT ARE THE THIS PANDEMIC HAS QUICKLY ERODED OUR RESERVES. IT IS DECIMATED OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. IT IS FORCED HARD WORKING PEOPLE OUT OF A JOB. IT IS CREATED REALITIES FOR OUR WORKING PARENTS WHO ARE NOW FORCED TO HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN HOME. IT IS EXACERBATED DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES. THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HAVE ALREADY FELT. LAST SEVERAL WEEKS I HEARD IN THE LA L. FROM FINANCE AND MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO THE COPA NINETEEN CRISIS. AND WHAT WE LEARNED EARLY ON IS THAT WHILE RESPONSE WAS NECESSARY RECOVERY WILL BE VITAL. NOT ONLY MEDICAL RECOVERY FROM COVERT NINETEEN BUT ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT WILL HELP US MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND GET OUR BUSINESSES BACK ONLINE AND OUR CHILDREN BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT AS CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT MY PRIORITIES WILL ALWAYS BE IN PROTECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AMONG THEM THE CHILDREN THE DISABLED IMMIGRANTS AND OUR ELDERS. I AM PROUD THAT IN RECENT YEARS ARE PAID AS PRIORITIZE THE EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE FOR OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. FIRST FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ALL KIDS NEXT HEALTHCARE FOR ALL YOUNG ADULTS IN THIS YEAR. BILLS ARE FOR THE INTEL WILL PRO HAVE ALSO HELPED US TO STRENGTHEN CAL WORKS. FOR FAMILIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTING TO BRING MUCH NEEDED DOCTORS AND NURSES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND INCREASING PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS THAT IMPROVE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. ALL OF THIS WORK HAS CREATED RESILIENCY IN OUR STATE AND WE CANNOT LOSE THAT RESILIENCY. MEMBERS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MY HOME DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE POOREST IN THE STATE. WE ARE BLESSED WITH A CAN DO ATTITUDE A RICH DIVERSITY OF CULTURES AND THE BEST PRODUCE IN THE WORLD. BUT WE ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM THE LAST RECESSION AND FROM DECADES OF BUILT IN DISPARITIES. IN MANY WAYS WE ARE NOT ONLY THE GEOGRAPHIC CENTER OF OUR STATE. BUT WE ARE ALSO THE EPICENTER OF THE ECONOMIC AND MEDICAL WELL BEING OF OUR STATE. AND THAT IS WHY I URGE US TO LOOK FOR RESILIENCY THAT WILL CARRY US THROUGH THE REVENUE LOSSES- PART OF AGENCIES. THAT WE FIND OURSELVES BADLY. I OR JUST SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT WILL UP LIFT ALL WORKING FAMILIES SUCH AS THE INCLUSION OF KELLY ITC IMMIGRANTS. FOR OVER DOLE AND SMALL INVESTMENTS. BEHIND WHAT MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF ALL OF OUR FAMILIES IN THIS BUDGET THIS IS A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AFTER ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MR MCCARTY. SIX THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MISTER BUDGET CHAIR YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT VOTE DIFFICULT CHOICES BUT THERE ARE LASTING IMPACTS WE MUST GRAPPLE WITH THIS KIT PANDEMIC HAS GREAT HISTORIC TIME FOR A PUBLIC EDUCATION ASK US TO RETHINK WHAT ARE MOST WHAT ARE MOST CRUCIAL ELEMENTS OF OUR ECONOMY OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS THEY IMPACTS SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS FROM CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL K. TWELVE AND COLLEGE AND WE KNOW THAT RE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS IN CHILD CARE CENTERS ARE CRITICAL TO RE OPENING OUR STATE ECONOMY AND THAT'S THE QUESTION I'LL GET TO IN A BIT. THESE THINGS ARE LINKED TOGETHER AND THE MAY REVISE WE SEE PROP AND EIGHT DOLLARS DROP FROM EIGHTY ONE BILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO SEVENTY BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR THIS MEANS THAT A ONE TIME LEFT IN OUR BUDGET WILL ONLY BE THE ANY WHAT'S THE TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS SO WE ASK THE QUESTION IS THIS BUDGET ENOUGH TO RE OPEN ARE CAUGHT. AND OUR K. TWELVE THIS IS HAS BEEN WE WORKING OVERTIME TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK FOR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND TEACHERS FACULTY. AND WE HAVE TO GET CREATIVE FACT. OPENERS SO WHAT THE ALONG RECOVERY. THE NEW NORMAL. OF NEW TO SET A- DISTANCE. AND IN PERSON AS WELL. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY KIDS FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. HERE IN SACRAMENTO. 20% OF OUR KIDS YOUR TWO THOUSAND KIDS NEARLY 10% OF OUR STUDENTS. ARE MISSING A WALL THEY HAVEN'T APPEARED ONCE. DURING THIS DISTANCE LEARNING PERIOD. WE KNOW THESE NUMBERS ARE GREATER IN SOME OTHER URBAN DISTRICTS. THE LEARNING LOS BLOCK GRANT THE BUDGET IS POSITIVE WILL BE HELPFUL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE FIX THAT TO MAKE SURE IMPACTS ALL DISTRICTS AS WELL. WE ALSO KNOW AS DR GRANT WILL MENTION WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HOW. MORE REVENUES COULD COME IN TO HELP NOW OUR SCHOOLS. NOT LESS. BY COMPARISON THE LAST RECESSION THE FEDERAL ABOUT. HAD ROUGHLY OUT IS THIS CARE ACT SO WE NEED MORE RESOURCES CUTS. WERE WE- WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN IF TRIGGER PULL. FIFTY THOUSAND. TEACH WOULD LOSE THEIR COULD SLIP ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CLASSIFIED WORKERS WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS. AVERAGE CLASS SIZE WOULD INCREASE BY TWENTY PERCENT. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND CAN'T HELP OUR ECONOMY REBOUNDS. ALSO NOTED THERE'S NO PLAN THIS BUDGET TO HELP REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS. AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE TO CLOSE THEM AGAIN WE JUST DON'T KNOW. AS FAR AS EARLY EDUCATION THIS BUDGET UNFORTUNATELY THE MAY REVISED ESTIMATES OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROGRESS WE'VE MADE THE PAST COUPLE YEARS ON CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL. IT'S A TOUGH CALL BUT THE RIGHT CHOICE I WILL KNOW IN THE MAY REVISED TO REPURPOSE MANY OF THESE DOLLARS. FROM ONE TIME DOLLARS FOR EASY- INFRASTRUCTURE THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION TO PROP UP THE EXISTING CHILD CARE SLOTS BUT ONE THING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE REJECT AND THAT'S THE CUTS. TO RATES FOR BOTH CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THESE SANDERS FAMILY BASED PROGRAMS CENTERS WERE BARELY AFLOAT BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE NINETEEN. AND WITH THESE RATE CUTS IT REALLY WILL BE THE DEATH KNELL TO THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS FOR LONELY WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR AS WE KNOW. THE WHAT IS THIS MEAN TO RE OPENING OUR ECONOMY. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO HAVING PEOPLE GO BACK TO WORK THEY'RE BOTH RELATED. OUR COLLEGES ALSO- FACE TOUGH CHALLENGES. WE HAVE INCREASED COST OUR CAMPUSES AT A TIME. WHEN REVENUES ARE DECREASING WE'VE SEEN REVENUE CUTS AND HOUSING AND PARKING SO IT'S A DOUBLE DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR OUR CAMPUSES. SO GO BACK TO OUR REALITY CHECK ON THIS ON THIS BUDGET. AND MY QUESTION IS WHEN I WOULD ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LA TO ENTERTAIN. WITHOUT OPEN SCHOOLS STABLE CHILD CARE AND ACCESSIBLE HIGHER EDUCATION CAN WE REASONABLY REOPEN CALIFORNIA AND SEE AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE NOT GONNA MISTER BLOOM. START WITH BARBARA YEAH YOU HAVE TO THE SCHOOLS QUESTION IS ONE THAT THAT REALLY KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN MYSELF AND THE SOCIAL DISTANCING PROTOCOLS THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTORS. RECOMMEND TO KEEP US ALL SAFE YOU KNOW ARE ARE HARD TO REALLY WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT- BUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WITH THAT THE SCHOOL FIELD- TO PUT FORTH GUIDANCE- TO HELP REOPEN TO RE OPEN AND GUIDE THE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS THIS FALL- THE FOUR POINT. BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS IN IT THAT WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO HELP TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION THE NECESSARY STEPS THAT SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A TO REOPEN SAFELY ENTERTAIN INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CLICK CLEANING PROTOCOLS- AND OTHER AYE AYE GUIDANCE THAT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO KEEP ALL OF US SAFE SO- THAT'S I AM YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE WE AGREED. THAT THAT THE SCHOOLS BEING OPEN IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE GOING BE GRAPPLING WITH- WITH THEIR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS LOCALLY AND WE HOPE TO GIVE GUIDANCE THAT'LL TO PROVIDE A AND HOW THEY CAN DO IT SAFELY AND ALLEN'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT IT'S WHAT THE REALLY BIG STRUGGLES- AT. THIS PANDEMIC IS COSTING IT IS ACT ON SCHOOLS AND THEN THE ENTIRE THAT HAD CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS. WORK SO THAT. HOW WE REALLY TRY TO PRIOR. THE SLOT WELL AND THEN GUIDANCE THE CHILD FACILITIES AS WELL THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER BLOW UP AND JUST A REMINDER THAT WE HAVE FOR ME IT'S IT'LL- FOR YOUR STATEMENT AND A QUESTION. YOU HAVE. YOUR I'M NOT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIR MEMBER. IT'S OFTEN THAT ARE BUDGETS ARE NEXT OF OUR VALUE AND APHORISM HAS NEVER BEEN APPARENT NO MORE IMPORTANT THAN NOW AS WE SEEK TO ADDRESS THE BUDGETARY FALL OUT OF A PANDEMIC THAT IS A HEALTH ECONOMIC SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS. LET US BEAR IN MIND THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE WARMING CLIMATES CONSTRAINTS ON HABITAT AND BIO BIO DIVERSITY LEGAL AND ILLEGAL TRADE IN WILD ANIMALS HAVE ALL PLAYED A ROLE. SO I'M FRUSTRATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR NATURAL RESOURCES. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT TOUGH CUTS ARE NEEDED AND WE ALL HAVE TO DO WITH LESS. BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS EIGHTY FUNDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND WE CAN'T FORGET THAT IN THESE PERILOUS TIMES TO COPE WITH NINETEEN CRISIS. HAS BEEN HARDER ON THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY SUFFERING FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT ACCESS THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND CLEAN AIR. THE MAY REVISION CONTAINS NUMEROUS FUND SHIFTS AND LOANS IN ORDER TO RELIEVE PRESSURE FROM THE GENERAL FUND. SIMULTANEOUSLY THE PROPOSAL'S PLACE US IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CLEAN AIR OR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THIS IS PLANTING THE SUPPLANTING OF GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. WITH EIGHTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL ACCOUNT. THIS ACCOUNT IS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF AIR POLLUTION. NOT TO FIX OUR GENERAL FUND CASH FLOW PROBLEM ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE PROPOSED ROLLBACK OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND WHICH EARMARKED IN MARCH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR A VARIETY OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS COUPLING THIS ROLL BACK WITH THE SHIFT OF EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING BASIS FROM THE WILD LIFE CONSERVATION BOARD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND IN THE FACT THEY'RE SAYING WE EITHER GIVE THIS MONEY THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD OR WE GET THIS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND- WELL I THINK THE F. W. CERTAINLY NEEDS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TAKING FROM ANOTHER SISTER DEPARTMENT CONDUCTING COMPLIMENTARY WORK IS SIMPLY NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH AND FINALLY WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO BECOME RESILIENT TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION BASELINE. REDUCTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND A REDUCTION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT WHICH IS A PROGRAM TO BRING GETTING TO BRING OUR GROUNDWATER TABLE BACK INTO BALANCE. I WORRY THAT THESE FUNCHESS AND REDUCTIONS WILL HAVE AN OVERALL REGRESSIVE IMPACT ON ALL OF OUR CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES EFFORTS AND SUCCESSES. MEMBERS I SHARE MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WILL BE EXPRESSED ABOUT OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUDGET. AS WE APPROPRIATELY FOCUS ATTENTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES ON IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS EDUCATION PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH. I HOPE THE AT THE ADMIT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL HEED THIS CALL ABOUT THE MANY CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTH. AND INDEED THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S RESIDENTS AND IT'S NATURAL RESOURCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH OTHER MISTER COOPER. MEMBERS SEVERAL ISSUES IN THE PURVIEW OF BUDGET SUB FOR RESEARCH POLICY AND PROCESS CONCERNS THE MAY REVISED CONTAINS A NUMBER O PROPOSALS TO CREATE NEW STATE DEPARTMENTS REORGANIZED EXISTING STATE DEPARTMENTS IS PROPOSALS IN X. NEVER GET POLICY CHANGES. THE LEGISLATURE'S NOT HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO CONSIDER ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSALS FOR TOO MUCH AUTHORITY THE NEW DEPARTMENT WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LEGISLATIVE INPUT AND OVERSIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE DV UP THE ONLY- RECOMMENDS THAT GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CHANGES PROPOSALS ARE BEST CONSIDERED THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY PROCESS FOR A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF ALL THE CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY THE LA- RECOMMENDS NOT APPROVING FUNDING TO LEGISLATURE MAKE A DECISION ON THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSED POLICY CHANGES GIVE THE DEPRESSED PERIOD OF TIME WE FACE TO THESE PROPOSALS IT MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER THEM THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND NOT TO RUSH THROUGH THEM. WHILE THE STATE PLACE ORDERS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN SLOWING THE DISEASE AND SAVING LIVES. THE SAME DAY PLACE ORDERS AND CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BAD PEOPLE TO CARRY OUT. EVIL DEEDS ON OUR CHILDREN AND WOMEN. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN PROTECTIONS AGAINST CHILDREN. I'VE ALSO AN INCREASE BUT IS EQUALLY EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS INCREASE OF INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN. THE INCREASE IN REPORTS OF ONLINE CHILD ABUSE IT SHOULD BE A TO STAY HOME ORDERS RESULTING IN YOUNG CHILDREN SPENDING MORE TIME ONLINE IN FALLING PREY TO ALL AYE PREDATORS. THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING EXPLOITED CHILDREN RECEIVE AN ASTONISHING FOUR POINT ONE MILLION REPORTS THROUGH THE CYBER TIP LINE LAST MONTH ALONE A 3% INCREASE OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND YET THE MAY REVISE THE LEADS CRITICAL FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA'S INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN TASK FORCES. THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MOMENT VIOLENT SEXUAL CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN CHILDREN OR DIFFERENT ONCE THEY'RE VICTIMIZED THEIR TRAUMA RARELY IF EVER GOES AWAY. THE BILL THE VICTIMIZATION. FOR A LIFETIME YOUR CHILDREN MY CHILDREN ALL CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN ARE NOT A NEW TO THESE PREDATORS. OUR CHILDREN YES NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT ABANDON THEM AND LEAVE THEM. TO BE PREYED UPON. NOW THE TIME NOT TO CUT THROUGH THE PROGRAMS THAT THE PROJECT THAT PROTECT OUR CHILDREN FROM ONLNE PREDATORS. I STRONGLY URGE YOU MY COLLEAGUES THE GOVERNOR TO RECONSIDER THESE PROPOSALS AND MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN. HEALTH CARE SIR SHOULD BE TOP PRIORITY ESPECIALLY DURING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. PLANNED PARENTHOOD SERVES THE FIRST AND SOMETIMES ONLY POINT OF CONTACT. INTO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH IS CRITICAL IN HELPING SPOT THE SIGNS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS. BUT ON A PLANE OVER TWENTY PERCENT. MORE MORE PEOPLE RELYING ON CLINICS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR THEIR HEALTH SERVICES. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALONE PLAYER PLAYER WHO PROVIDES OVER TWO THIRDS OF ALL PATIENTS RECEIVING PUBLICLY FUNDED BIRTH CONTROL AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES I REPEAT TWO THIRDS. BECAUSE THE PUBLIC TO FIFTY SIX RESULT IN ONE BILLION LOS. IN WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE SERVICES FORTY PROVIDERS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO CUT BACK ON SERVICES OFFERED MAYBE THE FORCING THE CLOSE OUR DOORS. RELEASED PATIENTS GO. ACTUALLY WE HAVE TO SPEAK MORE THE VISUALS RELYING ON THESE PROGRAMS. MEMBERS IS RESTORED TIMES REQUIRE A STORE NEAR YOU MEASURES ALLOWING LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IS NOT ONE OF. AS LA- POINTS OUT IT IS TROUBLED BY THE DEGREE OF A FORTY THE MINISTRATIONS REQUESTING. THE LEGISLATURE DELEGATE. FURTHER DELAY- STRONGLY URGES LEGISLATURE THIRTY SECONDS CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN A FORTY. I CANNOT AGREE MORE ENERGY TO JOIN ME REJECTING THE SIGNIFICANT POLICY PROPOSALS AND CUT TO THE HEALTH THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN. AND MOST VULNERABLE. THANK YOU NEXT WILL GO TO DOCTOR WEBER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER SPEAKER AND MR VICE CHAIR- I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT- SUB FIVE. OF WHAT I WANNA SAY ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS EVERYONE IS SAID THESE ARE VERY UNUSUAL TIMES AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THINGS ARE REALLY BAD WHEN AS WE OFTEN SAY WHEN AMERICA CATCHES A COLD. OF THOSE WHO VULNERABLE GET PNEUMONIA AND THE RECOVERY IS MUCH GREATER AND SO AS A RESULT WE WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BUDGET AND HOW IT AFFECTS. ALL OF US GENERALLY BUT SOME OF US MUCH MORE A PROFOUNDLY I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S THOUGHTFUL LEADERSHIP IN BOLD VISION ON PUBLIC SAFETY. THE MAY REVISIONS INCLUDE CRITICAL PROPOSALS THAT CONTINUE THE TRAJECTORY OF IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES FOR THE STATE INCLUDING THE CLOSURE OF TO PRISONS AND REALIGNING THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE DJJ TO THE COUNTIES. WITH THE TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS LIST OF CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS WITH CDC ARE. AND A DECLINING POPULATION OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS. CLOSING PRISONS IS NOTONLY PRACTICAL IS PHYSICALLY FISCALLY NECESSARY. THIS COMMITMENT TO CLOSE A PRISON HOWEVER SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN STATUTES. AND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ON FUTURE CAPITAL PROJECTS. SO YOU WON'T FIND OURSELVES FUNDING A CAPITAL OUTLAY AND THEN DISCOVERING THAT WE'RE CLOSING THE SAME PRISON WHERE WE BUILD NEW. NEW OF ROOFS OR OR BASICALLY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN THESE PRISONS. WE HAVE ASKED FOR THIS FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE ASKED FOR A LIST. AND THE STANDARDS BY WHICH WE WOULD CLOSE A PRISON WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THAT LIST AND WE HAVE YET TO KNOW WHAT THE STANDARDS WOULD BE. IF WE WERE TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT CLOSING A PRESENT. THE ALIGNMENT OF DJJ TO THE COUNTIES IS ALSO AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED LAST YEAR. WHILE KEEPING YOU'VE pIMPORTANT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESS IS DONE CAREFULLY WITH STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED THAT IT WILL BE OFFERED IS ROBUST. AND THAT'S STATE OVERSIGHT IS MAINTAINED SO THAT THE JUSTICE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE RECEIVE IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON WHERE THEY LIVE AT THE GEOGRAPHY. BUT BASED ON WHAT THE STATE STANDS AT ART WE INSURE THAT KIND OF ROBUST OVERSIGHT AND ROBUST PARTICIPATION PROGRAMMING TO EVERY CHILD. WHO UNFORTUNATELY IS AND THE ROLE OF THE JJ. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PRACTICALLY CAREFULLY RESULT REALIZE IT DOESN'T RESULT. IN MORE OF ARGUES BEING CHARGED AS ADULTS RATHER THAN STATE ONCE AGAIN GETTING THE CARE AND SERVICE THAT WE BELIEVE ME. THIS IS NOT BEEN THOUGHT OUT WE HAVE NOT HAD DISCUSSIONS WE HAD LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR. THAT WOULD NOT FRUITFUL DID NOT PROVE TO GIVE US THE ACTION WE NEED AND NOW BEING ASKED IN IN A MATTER OF MINUTES A SUBURBAN. BASICALLY MOVE ALL OF OUR THE DIGITAL JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS TO THE COUNTY WITHOUT A PLAN WITH ANY DIRECTION AS TO WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND THAT BRINGS US GREAT CONCERN. TO PROTECT LEGISLATIVE. THE FROM PREVIOUS YEARS WE HAD IN. WE'VE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN AS WE HAVE REDUCES TO. THE PRISON POPULATION WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CORRECT AND SOMETIMES THESE. WERE POSES COME OUT OF. OUT OF THE BLUE IS AS A RESULT OF THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SPOTTED OUT CAREFULLY NOT JUST FINANCIALLY THE PROGRAMMATIC LATE. WE ARE CONCERNED OF COURSE ABOUT THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. WE HAVE NOT BECAUSE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL THE COULD NOT DO INSPECTIONS BECAUSE IT DID HAVE STAFFING. SO LAST YEAR WE FOUGHT TO BASICALLY- STAFF OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND THEY'VE NOW HARD TO STAFF. AND THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO GET RID OF ALL OF THE STAFF AND REDUCE THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. WHICH WE FIND TO BE OF GREAT CONCERN AS WE TALK ABOUT CLOSING PRISONS. MORE LIKELY WOULD GIVE THAT TO AND THEN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. SO TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THINGS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE A HOUSING FOR PRISONERS LEAVING. AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE STILL IN PLACE. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR COURTS TO LOOK ONCE AGAIN FUNDED ADEQUATELY. AND THAT WE DO NOT GET RID OF MUCH OF THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE DEPENDENCY COOL INSTEAD OF THE YEAR. OF WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THINGS IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN PUBLIC SAFETY. TEL AND IS KNOWN PROBLEM THAT WE'RE. IN TRYING TO GET INTO REHABILITATION DOES KIND OF A THAT IMPORT. WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THAT IN THE- OF SIMPLY. A REDUCING THE BUDGET AND HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED. IN THE CUTS. IN THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I ONE THING BOTH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES WAS LA A FOR COMING IN PRESENTING- BEFORE US MY QUESTION IS JUST REALLY QUICKLY ON- THE RATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. IN CALIFORNIA HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO SEEING IF THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY TYPE OF A REBOUND. AS WE CAN AS WE BEGIN TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY PEOPLE GO BACK TO WORK. IF YOU LOOK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO BE ANY ANY REBOUNDING- AND THAT RIGHT AND EMPLOYMENT RATE TO SEE A DROP- AND THEN ALSO GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION THE BUDGET AS IS BEING PROPOSED THAT IN THE MAY REVISED- IF THE BUDGET WERE TO PASS AS IS- WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE- TO BE. BEYOND THAT IF EITHER OF IT THAT I'M BY BOTH OF YOU TO ANSWER- BUT JUST WANTING IF THERE'S BEEN ANY THOUGHT INTO WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE. AS WE RE OPEN AND THEN WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AT THIS BUDGET WOULD PASS AS IS. IF THE FATHER. YES SO WE DO ASSUME THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS GOING TO DECLINE- THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE YEAR I'M OUR FORECAST ASSUMES THE PEAK THIS QUARTER- ADD THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE AT TWENTY TWENTY BUT WE DO ASSUME THAT IT THAT IT STARTS TO DECLINE I'M GOING FORWARD AS THE ECONOMY RE OPENS- OUR FORECAST DOES NOT ASSUME A SECOND WAVE IN THE SECOND SET OF CLOSURES- WE DID WE DID DO AN EXTENDED SHUTDOWN OF SCENARIO- BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THE BUDGET IS BASED ON- SO I DO THINK THAT- YOU KNOW WE HOPE THAT AS THE RE OPENING CONTINUES- THAT. THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK- AND WE DO ASSUME- AN FOR THE ENTIRE TWENTY TWENTY YEAR BUT WE'RE ASSUMING THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A PEAK- THIS QUARTER- I HAVE OVER TWENTY FOUR PERCENT- SO IT IS VERY BLEAK- THAT THOSE ARE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS OF WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN MODERN HISTORY AND- AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY TO JUST THIS LAST MONTH THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO MIL AND- IF PEOPLE WHO LEFT THE JOB MARKET THERE'S NOT JUST PEOPLE WERE FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. ESSENTIALLY DROPPED OUT OF THE WORK FORCE AND ARE NOT NO LONGER LOOKING- SO THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT AND REALLY UNDERSTAND- THE TRUE IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT AND- MOTHERS UNCERTAINTY WE DO ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER. FROM WHERE IT IS TODAY. AND IN THE- LA OWES ANALYSIS I WOULD THINK THE MOST COMPARABLE WOULD BE THE L. SHAPE SCENARIO. IN THAT CASE WE ALSO THINK THE SECOND QUARTER THE ONE WE'RE IN NOW WOULD BE THE PEAK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. IN THAT IN THATTHAT IN THIS QUARTER WOULD BE EIGHTEEN PERCENT- AND THEN BEGIN TO GRADUALLY TRANSITION DOWN AND BUT- STILL BY THE END OF OUR FORECAST PERIOD. WE WOULD BE STILL AT. DOUBLE DIGIT TWENTY TWO- YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF IT IS. FOR IS YOU KNOW DIFFICULTIES WITH IT IS THAT THE DATA COMING IN. YOU KNOW ONCE A MONTH AND ITS REPORTING ON THE PRIOR MONTH SO THERE'S A LAG. ONE THING WE'RE KEEPING A VERY CLOSE EYE ON. THE WEEKLY NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBERS. AND KEEPING OUR EYE ON- HOW MANY- TOTAL PEOPLE ARE STILL ON UNEMPLOYMENT. INSURANCE BENEFITS AND TO THE EXTENT WE START TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS COME DOWN THAT WOULD BE SOME REASON FOR OPTIMISM. AND THERE ARE I MEAN I THINK ONE THING WE'RE FACED WITH AT THIS TIME IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ECONOMY. COULD HAVE SOME SOMEWHAT OF A THIRTY THREE A REBOUND AS AS THE- SUMMER MONTHS GO ON AND IF YOU BEGIN TO RE OPEN WE COULD SEE SOME JOB GROWTH NUMBERS. AND SO THE TREND MIGHT LOOK MORE FAVORABLE BUT STILL THE- UNDERLINED LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT COULD REMAIN YOU KNOW DRAMATICALLY- HI SO. THOSE ARE THE ITEMS WERE WATCHING. AND WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WE'RE NEXT GOING TO GO TO A MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. JOB AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS OF COURSE THOSE OF ITS CENTRAL AND- I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF KEY BUDGET ASKS THAT I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT DON'T GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE- IN PARTICULAR THE WILDFIRE RISKS ARE STILL WITH US- I'VE SUBMITTED A TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR REQUESTED BUDGET SUB THREE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING GRANTS TO PURCHASE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WITH THE QUICK MEANT. TO PREVENT WILDFIRES IN HIGH IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAS A SEVERITY ZONES IN BACKCOUNTRY AREAS- NUMBER TWO- AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF OUR HEALTH CARE ISSUES WE CAN'T FORGET THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH RARE DISEASE- INITIAL INVESTMENT OF TWO MILLION FOR PROJECT BABY BEAR BROUGHT US A LOT OF SAVINGS AS WELL AS THE NEW HOLDER GNOME SEQUENCING FOR CHILDREN OF RARE DISEASE WHICH SAVE MONEY AND THAT WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION IN PLEDGING TO OPEN TWO SITES AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OF CALIFORNIA TO TREAT AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MORE CHILDREN. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CURRENT CRISIS WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND AMONGST THOSE TWO- OR THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS ARE OVERCROWDED AND UNSANITARY MAKING THEM RIGHT FOR THE SPREAD OF A PANDEMIC. IN FACT EIGHT OF THE TOP TEN BIGGEST US CORONA VIRUS HOT SPOTS OUR PRISONS AND JAILS. BUT DON'T THINK THAT AN OUTBREAK BEHIND BARS WILL REMAIN THE- A SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT OF THE STATE'S POPULATION IS AT RESTORING A DISASTER OPENED THAT MIKE WITH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVING SENTENCES IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. AND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. THEY ARE AT RISK GOVERNOR NEWSOME CORRECTLY INCLUDED THOSE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED MOM VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. UNDER NUMBER TWO OF HIS SIX KING INDICATORS SLATED FOR PRIORITY FUNDING PEOPLE HIT HARDEST BY COLD WITH NINETEEN WHICH WAS ALSO IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPORT. WELL THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ORDER THE RELEASE OF PRISONERS ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST THAT'S SMALL SLIVER AND OVERALL POPULATION HAD JUST WEEKS REMAINING ON THEIR SENTENCES. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA BY THAT TIME COLE BUT NINETEEN CASES HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN TEN OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY FIVE PRISON. NOTHING SIGNIFICANT THE SIGNIFICANT HAVEN'T GONE TO PROTECT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO THE VIRUS. INCLUDING THE ELDERLY PREGNANT WOMEN PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING CONDITIONS IN THE CORRECTIONS OFFICERS WHO ARE EFFECTIVELY FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC. OVER TWENTY OF THE STATE'S PRISONS EMPLOYEE AT LEAST A THOUSAND STAFF THAT MEANS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING IN AND OUT EACH DAY. AND IT BASICALLY ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'VE DEPRIVE THOSE WE INCARCERATE OF ACCESS TO BASIC HEALTH CARE AND VIRTUALLY EVERY SANITARY PRODUCT RECOMMENDED. TO COMBAT THE DISEASE AT THE END OF THEIR SHIFT THE STAFF IS RETURN HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. SO THIS CRISIS BRINGS INTO FOCUS THE SERIES START THAT NATIONAL NATURAL DISASTERS PANDEMICS PS PS AND OTHER DISASTERS CAN INFLICT. ON THE CARS RATED POPULATION AND JUSTICE OPERATIONS WE CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE THE FOR A ONE TIME. WITH NINE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. THREE LONG TERM IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DISASTER READINESS PLAY AND FOR STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. TO BRING TOGETHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS TO COLLABORATE WITH CDC ARE AND DEVELOPING NEEDED SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING PLANNING ON EXACTLY WHICH PRISONS WOULD CLOSE. IS A NECESSITY THIS IS BEEN ISSUE FOR YEARS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ADDRESS THAT QUESTION FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOTH REDUCING POPULATION AND EIGHTEEN CORRECTIONAL STAFF PLANNING. EVEN AFTER CA NINETEEN HIT CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS REMAIN SEVERELY OVERCROWDED. AND WE NEED TO WORK ON THE COSTLY PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE TO FREE UP STATE FUNDING FOR CRITICAL REENTRY AND THIS IS CARLA THANK YOU THANK YOU. NOW THAT'S WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MISTER BROWN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PAYING MEMBERS. MANY OF US. ON THIS FORUM SERVED OUR DISTRICTS DURING A TIME OF INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY WHEN MULTI BILLION DOLLAR. MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUSES HAVE BECOME THE NORM ALLOWING US TO FRANKLY NOR THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS IMPOSED ON MANY OF OUR PREDECESSORS. MOST OF US ALL THE FOR ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE. I WAS REVIEWING SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTS BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE. NONPROFIT NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND REVENUES RESOURCES THIS WAS JUST UNDER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET. NEARLY FOUR BILLION TODAY JUST A FEW YEARS LATER IN THE TIME WE'VE BEEN. MR BLOOM SAID ARE SPENDING IS A REFLECTION OF VALUES. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA. THAT'S TRUE HIS REFLECTION I USE BUT- THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE WITH DIFFICULT BUDGET YEAR TO MAKE SOME DIFFICULT BUT PERHAPS GOOD REFORM. I CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL PUT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE BY THE GOVERNOR AND FINANCE TO REPRESENT A WORST CASE SCENARIO. IT MAKES CUTS THAT ARE PERHAPS MORE PAINFUL THE NECESSARY WHILE OFFERING LITTLE. IN THE WAY OF CREATIVE REVENUE GENERATION CONSERVATION ORDER FOR. I WAS LOOKING OVER A SECTION OF THE MAY REVISE THAT ACTUALLY DEALS WITH THE WATER BOARD. WHERE THEY'RE ADDING TWENTY POSITIONS SINCE JANUARY. THESE ARE DECISIONS MEMBERS WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT. THROUGH THIS PROCESS. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW MOST OF US COULD EXPLAIN RETURNED OR DISTRICTS AND TELLING OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE RESPONDED TO THE BIGGEST HEALTH CARE CRISIS IN MODERN MEMORY BY CUTTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM HEALTHCARE. IN OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. WELL WE ADDED TWENTY POSITIONS OF THE WATER FOR. CUTS TO FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS MEDI CAL BENEFITS MEDICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS STATE FAIRS OUR SCHOOL SIMPLY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL ROLE ALL THESE HAVE PLAYED IN OUR CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE. AS A CHAIR OF THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE I VIEW IT AS PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS BODY AND TO MY FELLOW MEMBERS TO UTILIZE THE INFORMATION EXPERTISE AT MY DISPOSAL TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO MINIMIZE THE MOST PAINFUL CUTS INCLUDE THIS BUDGET. I SPENT THE LAST FEW WEEKS IDENTIFYING SEVERAL WRIST REASONABLE AND MEASURED REVENUE GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES JUST WITHIN OUR COMMITTEE JURISDICTION. THESE REVENUE GENERATION PORTLY DO NOT ADD TO THE TAX BURDEN ON THE MIDDLE OR WORKING CLASS. LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THESE ITEMS TODAY. AS MANY BE AWARE. THE NUMBER OF TEENS USING E. CIGARETTES HAS SKYROCKETED IN RECENT YEARS I PLEDGE TO LAST YEAR ALONG WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS FOR TO RE EXAMINE HOW THE STATE TAXES YOU CIGARETTES AND AMENDED MY BILL AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THE TAX ON REGULAR COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. AND THE CIGARETTES. IN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE EXPERTS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION I WAS ENCOURAGED WHEN THE GOVERNOR SAW ABOUT YOU IN THIS ENDEAVOR AND PROPOSED AN EARLY VERSION OF THIS FOR TAX IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET. WITH A VALIUM ADDITIONAL TIME. AND IN. THE LA- ANOTHER SIDE FOR THE DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL BE ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. WE KEEP THE FIRST IN THE NATION TAX OF NICOTINE CONCENTRATION WHICH FOCUSES THE PUBLIC POLICY ON THE ADDICTIVE ELEMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS. FOR PROPOSED THAT THE TAX RATE IS SET AT TWO FORTY PER FORTY MILLIGRAMS RATHER THAN THE GOVERNOR'S TWO DOLLARS. WE ALSO UTILIZING COMMENCE OF FORTY MILLIGRAMS INSTEAD OF TWENTY MILLIGRAMS AS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO AVOID REWARDED YOU CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS. WHO CREATE SO CALLED LIGHT VERSIONS OF THEIR PRODUCTS. UTILIZING THIS NEW FORMULA IF YOU COULD WRAP UP. OKAY THIS PROPOSAL LOAN MEMBERS WOULD RAISE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION PER YEAR LIKELY INCREASING OVER TIME. IN ADDITION TO THAT PROPOSAL WE'VE IDENTIFIED NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ELIMINATE GAP OF TAX SUBSIDIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. UP TO TWO BILLION IN SPORTS WAGERING REVENUE AND SIMPLY BY TAXING CALIFORNIANS TO WIN THE LOTTERY SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR THIS CERTAINLY WON'T SOLVE OUR BUDGET CRISIS MEMBERS BUT GIVEN THE INCREDIBLE IMPACTS OF CORONAVIRUS ON THE BOTTOM LINE THESE PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESTORE FUNDING AND MAKE INVESTMENTS WHERE WE NEED THE MOST THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. MISTER MALL. THE BILL OF. MAYBE LATER PERFECT- DOCTOR WHAT. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON JUST A COUPLE OF AREAS IT APPEARS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND PREVENTION YOU KNOW DOING SOMETHING SO SOMETHING ELSE USUALLY SOMETHING REALLY BAD DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THIS CASE SPENDING MORE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN THAN THAN THIS. IN THE LONG RUN THAN THAT AND THEN THE SHORT TERM SAVINGS REPORT. AND FOR ALL THE TALK OF SCIENCE THESE DAYS WE APPEAR TO BE IGNORING PURE SCIENCE. IN FAVOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. IT FEELS LIKE WE JUST DUSTED OFF THE PLAN FOR THE LAST RECESSION OR USING THE SAME PLAYBOOK. WE MADE HUGE MISTAKES. AND WE PLAN TO REPEAT THEM. THEY'RE ALSO FEELS LIKE AN OVER DEPENDENCE ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WITH AN UNPREDICTABLE ADMINISTRATION. IF YOU'RE AGED COURT AND DISABLE THIS BUDGET IS DEVASTATING IT HITS THOSE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT AND WHO HAVE THE SMALLEST VOICES. THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISED ELIMINATES THE M. S. S. P. PROGRAMS AND SEE BASS PROGRAMS MS AS PEACE SERVICE TWELVE THOUSAND OF OUR OLDEST POOREST MOST FRAIL SENIORS. WILL PROVIDING VALUABLE SERVICES TO HELP KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOMES RATHER THAN GOING INTO NURSING HOMES SAVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND CERTAINLY KEEP THEM HAPPY HEARING CLOSER TO FAMILY. THE SEA BASS OUR COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES PROGRAM PROVIDES LOW INCOME ELDERLY OR DISABLED INDIVIDUALS WITH SERVICES. THAT MAXIMIZE THEIR THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING INSTITUTIONALIZED. THESE FOLKS ARE SEVERE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT LIKE ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA AND DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY. THIS BUDGET ALSO CUT SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM SO MORE SENIORS WILL GO HUNGRY. SO WITHOUT CRITICAL SERVICES AND FOOD MANY SENIORS WILL HAVE TO GO IN A NURSING HOMES. WERE NEARLY 40% OF THE CLUB DEATHS FROM COVERED NINETEEN CALIFORNIA OF HAPPENED. AND YEAH NURSING HOMES ARE WAY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THESE PROGRAMS EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER RESIDENT. AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY BECAUSE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FUNDING THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WOULD WATCH OVER THESE RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITHOUT FAMILY MEMBERS. REPRESENTED AS A SENIOR SENIOR ORGANIZATIONS ARE HORRIFIED. THEY'VE BEEN REACHING OUT IN SOME OF BEEN WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING HAVE BEEN ASKING IS THIS THE FUTURE. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT DIABETES. FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIABETES AND TO HAVE EITHER PRE DIABETES OR UNDIAGNOSED DIABETICS. DIABETES CAN COST STROKE HEART DISEASE AMPUTATION END STAGE RENAL DISEASE BLINDNESS AND DEATH. AND NOW THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE CUTS THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM. ACROSS THE STATE LESS THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THRE'S A FEDERAL MASS. PARTICIPANTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO DEVELOP TYPE TWO DIABETES BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE STATE WOULD RATHER JUST ADD TO THE OVER THREE POINT SIX. BILLION DOLLARS COST. OF MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR THE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS WHO ARE DIABETIC. THIS IS NUTS. THE BUDGET ALSO CALLS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF OPTIONAL MEDICAL SERVICES DENTAL PROCEDURES TO TREAT GUM DISEASE AND REMOVABLE APPLIANCES TO REPLACE MISSING TEETH. BUT I ACTUALLY WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT A WOUND CARE TO PREVENT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND AMPUTATIONS. OPTOMETRIC SERVICES TO HELP WITH THE VISUAL THE CLIENTS THAT HAPPEN WITH DIABETES. THIS IS REALLY PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH. THE ADMINISTRATION'S ALSO CUTTING NURSE ANESTHETISTS SIR AND THAT'S WHAT THE SERVICES WHICH WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NO ANESTHESIOLOGIST. OR ONES THAT ACCEPT MEDICARE. AFTER PUSHING SO HARD FOR THE PASSAGE OF PROP FIFTY SIX AND REBUILDING OR MEDI CAL PROVIDER NETWORK WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT WILL DEVASTATE PROVIDER NETWORKS. SO WE WILL HAVE ELIGIBILITY WITH FEWER PROVIDERS AND SERVICES AND I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE IN THE LONG RUN GO ACROSS THE STATE AND WAY MORE MONEY. THAN THIS ADMINISTRATION THINKS IT WILL SAVE AND PEOPLE WENT UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE KNOW WHAT PREVENTION WORK WE KNOW PREVENTION WORKS ACROSS THE BOARD WITH THERE'S HEALTHCARE WILDFIRES HOMELESSNESS DRUG ADDICTION I COULD GO ON. IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE SAY THESE PROGRAMS AND YOU SAVE LIVES AND MONEY CUT THESE PROGRAMS AND COSTS WILL INCREASE IN LIVES WILL BE LOST. WHEN I HAD A QUESTION PROMISED TO MAKE IT AS A STATEMENT WHEN I AM REALLY FRUSTRATED WITH IS THAT. BUDGET LIMóN IT'S A LOT OF PROGRAM HE LIMóN IT SOME DOESN'T PUT THEM ON. I BUT- FOR A RAINY SO OF THIS IS HARD WHAT POLICY WORK THAT WE DID HERE AND SOME OF WITH LAST YEAR SIGNED BY THIS GOVERNOR. GOING AWAY. NO POTS THIS IS WRONG. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER LOW THE MISTER PATTERSON AND THE MISTER LIVING HELLO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE BUDGET CHAIR TING AND COLLEAGUES- ONE THIRD OF. ECHO APPRECIATION TO YOU MISTER BUDGET CHAIR OF FOR A BEING IN THIS POSITION GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN YOUR A BACKGROUND- WE ARE VERY PROUD TO HAVE YOU IN THIS CAPACITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE AT NO TO ASSEMBLY AS ANOTHER COLLEAGUE. SAY MENTIONED- BEING IN THIS INSTITUTION WHEN THIS HAPPENED BEFORE AT APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO TO WHICH I WAS A STAFF MEMBER AND THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO WHICH THIS OCCURRED AND- HAD SEEN THE CUTS AND THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS AS A LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS. PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT EXISTED WAS THAT THOSE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ONLY SERVE SIX YEARS AND THE TERMS AND HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I WORK NOW WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO THINK LONG TERM SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND WE CAN THINK ABOUT. THE VESTED FUTURE THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON SIMILAR YOU SEEN. HOPE THAT WE WILL GET FROM THE MINISTRATION THE WHOLE OTHER SUPPORT FROM IN FEDERAL MINISTRATION AND AS ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK COMMONLY SAYS HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY. WE MUST CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN AMONGST OURSELVES AND I'M VERY PROUD TO ALSO HERE ARE REPUBLICAN VICE CHAIR STATE EARLIER THAT WE MUST PROTECT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE. I THINK ABOUT THIS THE COMMUNITY THAT I RESIDE AND REPRESENT SILICON VALLEY ONE OF THOSE. WEALTHY READ IN THE STATE AND IN THE COUNTRY. HOME TO APPLE. MOST PEOPLE. IN THE STATE ONE OF MY VALUE COMPANIES THE WORLD. AND YET THE CUPERTINO. SCHOOL DISTRICT. IT'S ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. SIX STRAIGHT YEARS OF BUDGET CUTS. SIX STRAIGHT YEARS. NOW HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE IN WHICH YOU LIVE IN RESIDE IN A TALE OF TWO COMMUNITIES. NOW WE ALWAYS SAYS THINK OKAY. THE CALGARY WILL COME AND SAVE THE DAY I THINK THAT OFTENTIMES. AND AS I SIT HERE WITH THIS START PROJECTIONS WE QUICKLY REALIZED. THERE IS NO CALORIE. MEMBERS WE ARE IT. HOW ABOUT HEALTHCARE. THERE'S THIS. NOTION OF- THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING THOSE MOST VULNERABLE AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. WITH RESPECT TO AN ELIMINATION OF A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR MEDI CAL. A ROMAN NAVIGATOR PROGRAM WHICH WILL ASSIST THOSE MOST VULNERABLE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND IN FACT CLOSE 290% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT UTILIZE THIS PROGRAM. FAIL TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION 90% AND YET WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS CUT WE LOSE AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION. FROM THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS LAW. NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC YOU WOULD THINK THAT WE WOULD NOT WANT TO LIMIT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BUT INCREASES. SO MEMBERS WE MUST. FOCUS NOW AND HELP IDENTIFY THE CHALLENGES THAT EXISTS TO HELP REWRITE THE RULES OF ECONOMY TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. REVENUE MEASURES MUST CONTINUALLY BE ON THE TABLE YOU'VE HEARD FROM SOME COLLEAGUES ABOUT REFERENCING TO OTHER RECORD MANAGERS. AND AGAIN THINK ABOUT THIS NOTION OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. TO WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE AS A FOURTH GENERATION CALIFORNIAN. WELL MY GRANDFATHER NO COLLEGE EDUCATION WORK AT FRANK THAT. WAS IT WAS IT FOR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL YOU SEE THIRTY SECONDS. AND THEN THE CREEK SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES AND NOW THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION IS FEELING THE BRUNT OF THIS. TO WHICH I MYSELF CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE COMMITTEE THAT I REPRESENT. I'M APPROACHING FORTY YEARS OLD LIVE IN A THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT CONDO WITH MY BROTHER WHO'S THE SENATE A POLICE OFFICER. I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR THE POLITICIAN THINK ABOUT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TRYING TO ACCESS. SHE PROGRAMS THAT'S OUR OBLIGATION THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HERE WE MUST FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE A VOICE WE MUST FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT CENTERS HERE. AND WE MUST ALSO FIVE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE REPRESENTATION HERE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WIDE DIVERSITY OF A GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE I KNOW THAT WE LIVE UP FAMILIES EACH AND EVERY DAY BECAUSE- LEAD WITH OUR HEART. AND AS WE LOOK AT THIS BUDGET IN CLOSING. THIS THINK. OF LONG. ACCESS THIS WILL HAVE NOT THE SHORT TERM BUT LONG TERM. CAN WAKE UP EACH AN EVERY DAY THING. WE DID THE BEST THAT WE COULD. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU. MISTER PATTERSON THE MISTER LEVINE AND THEN MISTER THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO OUR- ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH THE DOCTOR WOULD. WITH ALSO MEMBER LOW. HE TALKED ABOUT THE CAVALRY. WAITING ON FEDERAL AID THAT MAY OR MAY NOT COME. AND WHILE WE WAIT FOSTER YOUTH RESOURCE FAMILY SENIOR CITIZENS ARE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE DIRECTLY NOW BEARING THAT BURDEN. IF THIS FINANCIAL AID DOES NOT MATERIAL. MATERIALIZE WHAT IS THE PLAN BE WE SPEAK JUST A MOMENT FOR AND ON BEHALF OF OUR HOSPITALS ARE HOSPITALS STEPPED UP. PROVIDE THE CAPACITY FOR THE COLD LAKE BEDS AND FOR THE TREATMENTS AND AS A RESULT THE- CASH FLOWS AND THE RESOURCES OF OUR HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE CRASHED. JUST IN MY COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER IS FACING A LOSS OF AND I HAD TO CHECK THE FACTS ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S DONE TO ME. TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH LOS VALLEY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IS FACING ALMOST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH IN LOSSES WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE HEALTH ON THE WELL BEING OF OUR HOSPITALS BECAUSE OUR HOSPITALS TAKE CARE OF THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF OUR INDIVIDUALS. I ALSO STAND HERE IN AND JOIN WITH MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. MISTER GIBSON. TO BESIEGE THIS ADMINISTRATION TO PAY ATTENTION TO MLK HOSPITAL IN HIS DISTRICT IT WILL COLLAPSE. IF IT IS NOT RESCUE. PLEASE LISTEN. AND THEN FINALLY THE WHOLE QUESTION ABOUT THE QUOTE UNQUOTE REALLOCATION OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP FIFTY SECOND FUNDS. MET MEMBERS THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST I THINK ASTOUNDING. ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE THOSE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WELL FIRST OF ALL EXPLAIN WHERE DID YOU GET THIS IDEA. OF RATING PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS AND WHAT ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTIFICATION. BEHIND THESE CUTS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO MEMBERS. IT COMES TO THIS BODY TO HAVE ONE VOICE A STRONG VOICE THAT SAYS. THIS IS NOT A BLUEPRINT THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF HERE. AND WE'RE ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION TO HEAR US. AND TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES. IN A BUDGET THAT MISSES THE MARK SUBSTANTIALLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LIVING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU TO HIS BOSS LAWYER TO MISS MISTER PACK TO THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET STAFF TO THE FINANCE STAFF IN IN LA STAFF. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL BUDGET. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK. AND YOUR TIRELESS DEDICATION TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FOUR MINUTE PERIOD TO ASK QUESTIONS THOUGH I KNOW THAT THESE QUESTIONS CANNOT BE GIVEN THE RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE WITH THAT TIME FRAME. AND SO I DO ANTICIPATE ANSWERS AT A DIFFERENT POINT IN TIME OR WRITTEN THAT CAN GIVE US THE- IN THAT WE DO NEED. I ANY ANALYSIS THAT I THINK ALSO IT'S REQUIRED DURING THIS TIME. EARLIER THIS YEAR I INTRODUCED AB TWENTY SIX FORTY SIX WHICH WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED EIGHTY A FUNDING. AND REPLACE THAT WITH AN A STUDENT ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING THIS WAS ADOPTED IN SB ONE SEVENTEEN THIS YEAR BUT IT IS NOT ADOPTED IN THE REVISED AS IT IS PRESENTED- AS I UNDERSTAND IT. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ATTENDANCE NEXT YEAR A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS THAT MAYBE IF A CHILD IS SICK THAT CHILD SHOULD NOT BE COMING TO SCHOOL. PARENTS WORK SCHEDULE OR SIBLING SCHOOL SCHEDULES IT WILL BE HARD. FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THE ATTENDANCE THAT THEY WOULD WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO HAVE. AND OF COURSE WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'VE LOST SOME KIDS WE NEED TO FIND THEM AGAIN. NONE OF THIS SHOULD- PENALIZE A CLASSROOM THE FUNDING THAT THE CLASSROOM NEEDS AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATIVE LEADERS MOVED TO. AN ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING MECHANISM- NOT JUST NEXT YEAR BUT REALLY- FOR TIME- IN PERPETUITY IN THE FUTURE. ALSO ON A. YEAH I CONTINUE THE CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM ESCONDIDO AND OTHERS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF PRISONERS- IN OUR IN OUR PRISONS WE NEED TO HAVE AGREED UPON WRITTEN PLANS WITH THE PRISON FACILITIES AND OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF THERE IS A SURGE OF INFECTION WE KNOW THAT OUR LOCAL HOSPITALS CANNOT DEAL WITH BOTH AN INFLUX OF. PATIENTS FROM OUR PRISONS IF THERE IS ALSO A SIMULTANEOUS SURGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES SAN QUENTIN FOR EXAMPLE- IN PINE BY WHERE I LIVE- WOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE MY CHILDREN WERE BORN WHICH HAS FOURTEEN I SEE YOU THAT'S- THAT'S HARDLY ENOUGH IT WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION LET ALONE- WOULDN'T OPERATE COULD COULD DO. PRISON OF FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WE KNOW IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS OVER NINE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH OVER FIFTY HAVE BEEN PLACED IN IN. IT'LL ACOSTA STATE WILL. NOT ON THEY CAN DEAL. WE ALSO CONCERN FROM COLLEAGUE FROM SAN ABOUT EDUCATE FUNDING A PARTICULARLY HIGH EDUCATION AS ARE UNDER OR UNEMPLOYED THEY MAY NEED TO SHIFT THEY ME I HOPE THAT THEY WANT TO I SPEND TIME TRAINING OR GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND THAT COULD HAVE INCREASED DEMAND ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION OR OTHER SKILL BUILDING CENTERS FOR LEARNING AND WE NEED TO BE MAKING TARGETED INVESTMENTS TO ANTICIPATE THAT NEED TO WELL TO PROVIDE THE REBOUND THAT OUR ECONOMIES SO DESPERATELY NEED. THIRTY I ALSO HEARD FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES ABOUT- THE HOLD UP OF FEDERAL FUNDS. AND THEY NEED IF THEY'RE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THEY NEED TO GET THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS SHOULD WE BE RIDING THIS MIGHT BE FOR THE LA- RIGHT INTO THEIR A FORMULA TO GET THOSE FUNDS TO THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LASTLY. WHEN WE'RE CUTTING SO MANY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS ARE WE MAKING OUR INVESTMENTS WISELY. SO WITH OUR- PET PAYMENTS ARE WE SUBSIDIZING IN AREAS FOR RETIREES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE STATE AND FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR AND WE MAY NEED TO HAVE SOME VERY DEEP ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STRETCHING EVERY DOLLAR. AS FAR AS IT WILL GO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WE'RE GONNA HAVE MISTER FISHER MISSED MEDINA AND MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHIP. IN MY ROLE AS A CAPACITY OF THE A TEAR OF TRANSPORTATION IN THIS BUDGET I'VE SEEN AT A COST SHIFTING IS GOING TO OCCUR PROPOSED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE IS INTERESTING COME ACCOUNT ON TITLE. NINETEEN MONEY. NOW WE LOOK AT THAT POSSIBILITY. IT IS THE AUTHOR OF AC AC A FIVE. THAT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. WE MADE A PROMISE TO THE TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE WOULD USE TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES NOT BALANCE THE BUDGET. AND SO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THAT IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE QUESTION. ALSO AS THE AUTHOR CO AUTHOR OF SB ONE WE INITIATED A HUNDRED MILLION OR HER MILLION DOLLAR SAVINGS WITH CALTRANS. INTO THAT BILL WILL CALTRANS CAME BACK. WITH TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS- TO SHOW THAT THEY COULD AND WOULD BE PART OF THE PROCESS. KNOWING THAT YOU KNOW FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND ON TRANSPORTATION. SAVES US TEN DOLLARS DOWN THE ROAD. THE DUGGAR GATES AT A RAPID PROCESS AND DOESN'T HAVE A GRADUAL DECLINE IT HAS A CLIP. WHEN I SEE THE SHOT BEING UTILIZED IN THE LAST CTC HEARING. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER FOUR YEARS FOR SAFER STREETS VERSES THE SHOPPER MAINTENANCE IT GIVES ME PAUSE AND WONDERING WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO THIS BODY THAT WAS A SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE. BUT THEY MEANT TO. AND THAT WE MADE ALL OF THE EFFORTS TO PASS SB ONE AND THEN DEFEAT SB- THE- PROPOSITION SIX THE PUBLIC DID THAT. SO THAT ON ITS OWN MERIT TELLS US THAT WE NEED TO BE STEWARDS OF TRANSPORTATION MONEY LIKE WE PROMISED. SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. AND I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS NOW. THE POPULATION IN THIS BUDGET I SEE. A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CUT. I'M ALSO GETTING REFERENCE FROM FROM OF PROVIDERS OF ADULT DAYCARE HOMES THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SUFFER 14% CUTS. NOW REMEMBER WE THE MIND IS THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA TO SAVE. MONEY AND I WOULD IN THE GENERAL FUND. NOW THOSE FOLKS WERE ABSORBED IN ADULT DAY CARE OR ADULT. GROUP HOMES AND NOW WE'RE GONNA CUT THOSE GROUP HOMES. TO BE ABLE TO. OF BOUNCE THE BUDGET. HOW DO WE TAKE CARE OF THESE FOLKS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE UNDERPRIVILEGED. THE I. D. V. POPULATION HAS VERY LITTLE. HELP AND WE NEED TO HELP THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND NOT KEEP CUTTING AND BALANCING THE BUDGET ON THEIR BACKS. UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLD FUNDING. WILL BE ELIMINATED. FOR THE EARLY INTERVENTION. KNOWING THAT THAT IS THE MOST AN INFLUENTIAL STAGING MOST BENEFICIAL STAGE OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR BLOSSOMING. WE'RE CUTTING YOU'RE GONNA HEAR A LOT ABOUT COST SHIFTING. COST SHIFTING SO WITH THE ID POPULATION OF WERE UNDER FUNDING- CUTTING THE ADULT GROUP HOMES. AND THOSE GO OUT OF BUSINESS WE'RE GOING TO GO IN TWO THIRTY SEVENTH INSTITUTIONALIZED CARE WHICH IS DRAMATICALLY MORE EXPENSIVE SO WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHERE WE ARE CUTTING. IN ONE OF THE BUDGET HEARINGS MISTER KING PRODUCT CAL WORKS A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR ASSUMPTION. THE CAL WORKS WILL BE HITTING BEING HIT. WITH THIS BUT NO REAL. EVIDENCE YET. BUT IF THE MONEY'S NOT USE WILL BE STAGNANT JUST ROLLED OVER. BUT ON UTILIZED IN THIS BUDGET. OF THE PRESENCE. WELL SAID WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE HAVE A BIT OF VERY THAT IT PLAN AND THE HOSPITAL'S TAKING A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CUT WE COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON ABOUT WHAT IS FOUR MINISTRY NOT ENOUGH HERE BUT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE ID POPULATION I PERSONALLY THANK YOU SO MISTER MEDINA MISTER MATHESON THAN THIS BOERNER HORVATH. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. I I'D LIKE TO TALK TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF OUR CORE VALUES EDUCATION. AND I WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR OF FROM SACRAMENTO THE CHAIR OF SUB TO FOR HIS LEADERSHIP- MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN JOSE AND MARIN. TALKED ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IT WAS A DREAM THAT THAT I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE DREAM THAT MY FATHER AND MOTHER WHEN THEY CAME FROM CENTRAL AMERICA THE CALIFORNIA AND IT TAUGHT ME AND MY THREE SIBLINGS THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION. IT IS A DREAM THAT CANNOT DIE IN CALIFORNIA. AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS SO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF-EDUCATION. IMPORTANCE AS A THE CHAIR OF SUB TO STATED THAT SCHOOLS NEED MORE MONEY NOW NOT LESS AND ALONG WITH MORE MANY THEY NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY. FLEXIBILITY IN CLASS SIZE FLEXIBILITY IN THE LENGTH OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. I NOW WANT TO SHIFTED TO. PARTICULAR IDEAS THE FIRST IS CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TWELVE EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN HOW BRIGHT COLLEGE WAS ALLOCATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AN ON GOING GOING FUNDS AND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME ZONES THAT COULD BE SPENT OVER SEVEN YEAR PERIOD. SINCE THEN THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLR IN ONE TIME FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED COPYRIGHT REPORTS HAVING FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS CURRENTLY BUT ONLY SEVENTY THREE HAVE GONE THROUGH ORIENTATION AND TO THE ACTUAL PROGRAM WELL THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED A CUT TO EXISTING FUNDING I THINK WE NEED TO GO MUCH DEEPER. DURING THIS TIMES WE SHOULD ELIMINATE FUNDING TO CALIBRATE ENTIRELY ELIMINATING CALIBRATE WOULD MEAN TWENTY MILLION AN ON GOING SAVINGS PLUS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION IN ONE TIME SAVINGS I WOULD ALSO SAY THE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT I INTRODUCED THE IDEA OF DOING A NOT IT. WOULD SAY THAT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE THE I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT BE NEEDED TO PLACES WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE BETTER USED. PART TIME FACULTY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FACING A SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET CUT. AND THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. BESIDES CARD RIGHT I WANT TO MENTION THAT YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE AND PRIVATIZING FUNDING FOR THE UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE A COMMUNITY BASED MEDICAL SCHOOL GLAD TO SEE THE ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO THIS SCHOOL THE SCHOOL. IN SUCCESS IS IMPORTANT TO OUR REGION WILL HELP CULTIVATE FUTURE DOCTORS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF ABOUT MY SUGGESTION OF ELIMINATING CALIBRATE ALL TOGETHER. THANK YOU- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED- WITH THIS PANDEMIC THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING. TO WATCH IS THE- THE AMOUNT OF INNOVATION THAT'S HAPPENED WITH ONLINE LEARNING AND DISTANCE LEARNING IN FACT THE CSU JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAINTAIN THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING POSTURE INTO THE FALL FOR A LOT OF COURSES. I'M SO I'M YOU KNOW I THINK THAT YOU KNOW DISTANCE LEARNING AND ESPECIALLY THE CALIBRATE. UNITY COLLEGE I WAS REALLY- ESTABLISHED UNDER THE PROMISE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY BUSY. WORKING GOING TO SCHOOL AB WORKING AND RAISING FAMILIES AND OFTEN CANNOT ACCESS SCHOOL DURING THAT REGULAR EIGHT TO FIVE EIGHT TO SIX A TIME PERIOD IN AND REALLY NEED THE CHANCE TO HAVE A MORE SELF PACED- I PROGRAM AND ONE THAT THEY CAN ACCESS IN THE EVENINGS AND ON WEEKENDS. AND SO THAT WAS REALLY SOME OF THE NOTIONS BEHIND AN ONLINE COLLEGE. THAT IS DEDICATED AND REALLY HAS EXPERTISE- AND THAT'S- YOU KNOW OUT. THAT THAT'S WHERE AND THAT PROPOSAL CAME FROM- BUT I DO THINK THAT. AS WE HAVE WE AS WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW ALL OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAD TO GO ONLINE OVERNIGHT ALL OF OURS K. TWELVE SCHOOLS HAD TO GO ONLINE OVERNIGHT. ALL OF THOSE THINGS- HAVE CREATED YOU KNOW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CHANGE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE OPTIONS IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOUR TIME IS UP. THANK YOU MISS MEDINA MISS MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. TODAY WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF OUR PAST THREE SESSIONS. AS PRESIDENT REAGAN ONCE AID MORE GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING GREAT BUT INSTEAD I SEE WE ARE GOING DOWN THE SAME ROADS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. HAVE WE LEARNED NOTHING. FROM THE COLLEAGUES YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO STAND UP AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND ACTUALLY GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. WE'VE SEEN THE GOVERNOR CHANGE OVER TWO HUNDRED PIECES OF LEGISLATION WITH THE WEB OF AND- LETTING CRIMINALS INTO OUR STREETS WHILE RESTING BUSINESS OWNERS. CLOSING PRISONS AND FORCING PRESSURE ON TO OUR COUNTIES WERE FACING BUDGET CUTS AS WELL. OUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE INSURING FAMILIES THE ABILITY TO WORK. TO SEND OUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL HAVING SAFE COMMUNITIES IN SECURING OUR ECONOMY. GET IN OUR COUNTIES IN SMALL BUSINESSES THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO OPEN. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SAFELY GET BACK TO WORK. THE MORE PEOPLE WE HAVE WORKING THE MORE REVENUE WE BRING IT. THESE REVENUES ARE NOT JUST. FUND PROGRAMS. BUT THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR FUTURE. AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH GOVERNMENT AID IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO MAKE US WHOLE AGAIN. THIS GOVERNMENT HAS RAN OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS A ONE TRILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT ASK. YET WE ARE FILED OVER SIXTY TWO LAWSUITS AGAINST THE FENCE. TALK ABOUT BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU. LET'S NOT FORGET OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. CUTS TO OUR ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CUTTING PREVENTIVE CARE WE KNOW THIS ONLY CAUSES MORE. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD A FIRST CLASS MEDICAL WORKFORCE. NOT JUST FOR URBAN AREAS BUT OUR ROLE WANTS TO. WE NEED TO BRING MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHICH WE KNOW IS ONE OF THE POOREST AREAS AND OUR STATE THAT STILL HAS THIRD WORLD CONDITIONS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE INVESTMENT OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND THE SOUTH VALLEY THERE. NOW THE GOVERNOR IS TALKING ABOUT GOING AFTER OUR PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS IS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS. MY DISTRICT. WITH THESE CUTS. FACES UP 215% MEDICAL CLOSURES. AS STATED BEFORE NOT JUST MY HOSPITALS THE HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE. ARE FACING CLOSURE. AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT BETTER WAYS TO HELP THEM. OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE NEED TO HAVE OUR BACKS HAVE THEIR BACKS BECAUSE THEIR BACKS ARE AGAINST THE WALL THESE BUDGET CUTS SCHOOL PHILIP CIVILITY IS ALL OF THESE THINGS WE NEED TO LISTEN. AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT IT'S ALREADY BEEN STATED OUR EDUCATION IS OUR FUTURE. THIRTY SECONDS. YOU KNOW MEMBERS THE CLOSE THIS I'VE I'VE GOT MANY MANY MORE OBVIOUSLY ISN'T ENOUGH TO ADDRESS AN ENTIRE BUDGET BUT THIS IDEA. OF ALL THIS COST SHIFTING. IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE OUR STATE CANNOT BEG BORROW AND STEAL FROM THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE AND WE ALL KNOW BETTER. I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU IN THE MAJORITY TO PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN TO THE GOVERNOR AND GET THIS RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR NOT SAYING THIS BOERNER HORVATH SOME GOING TO GO TO MR LACKEY IN THIS MYTH THE BILL. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND CHAIR. THE INTELLECTUALLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED SYSTEM AS FOR THE BIG DEVASTATED BY THIS PROPOSAL THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL UNLIKE OTHER SAFETY NET ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THE IDEAS NEVER BEEN MADE WHOLE AFTER DECADES OF CUTS. RECESSIONARY OF ERA POLICIES AND FROZEN RATES FAR FROM RECOGNIZING THIS THE MAY REVISION EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM WITH FURTHER CUTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES CONDUCTED THEIR OWN RATE STUDY DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION WITH A B. IN NEW FUNDING THAT WAS REQUIRED TO FUND THE CITED THE SYSTEM APPROPRIATELY. THE BASE CUTS THE TOTAL BASE CARDS AMOUNT TO EIGHTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND IF WE CONSIDER THE ADDITIONAL CUTS OF NO FEDERAL MONIES RECEIVED. THERE'S A TOTAL ADDITIONAL KIND OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE. RIGHT THREE MILLION. COLLEGE WE HAVE WHAT IS. CALLED THE LETTERMAN ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO SERVICES TO THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE MORE INDEPENDENT AND FULFILLING LIVES. AFTER THE BUDGET PROPOSAL MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S LACK OF APPARENT DIRECTION TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY THAT SHOWED THIS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. THE MAY REVISION SHOW EVEN MORE FLAGRANT DISREGARD FOR THE IMPORTANT ROLES. THESE PROVIDERS PLATE AND CARING FOR THAT POPULATION. AND PROVIDING THEM THE KEY SERVICES THEY OFFER. KNOWING THAT THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HUGE GAPS IS SORT FALLS LEFT FOR DECADES OF UNMET NEEDS AND UNRESOLVED HOLES LEFT IN THE- A PREVIOUS RECESSION WHY TURN AGAIN TO THIS POPULATION. FOR BUDGET SOLUTIONS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT ABOUT TO DJJ THE CCPOA UNDOUBTEDLY HAS THE BEST TRAINED YOUTH CORRECTIONAL STAFF. IN THE CDC OUR DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WHICH IS DJJ. THEY ALSO THE GREATEST ACCESS TO RESOURCES FOR PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT AND THIS IS JUST A RHETORICAL QUESTION. HOW DISCLOSING THREE DJJ FACILITIES ARE REALIGNING WORDS TO OVERBURDEN COUNTIES CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTERMENT OF REHABILITATION. AND THE RUSH TO CLOSE THESE FACILITIES THERE ARE MANY COSTLY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AS THE CHAIR OF SUB FIGHT STATED. I NOW WOULD LIKE TO CLUB THREE QUESTIONS TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THERE ARE THERE YES NO. ANSWERS FIRST OF ALL WITH THE STATE CONSIDER EXTENDING THE STATUTORY CARRY FORWARD PERIODS BY THREE YEARS DUE TO THE FIVE MILLION LIMITATION OPPOSED YEARS TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR THE BUSINESS TAX CREDITS IMPACTED. SECOND WITH THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT APPLY ON A SEPARATE COMPANY OR COMBINED UNITARY GROUP BASIS AND THIRDLY WITH THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LIMóN APPLY TO ALL BUSINESS CREDITS OR TO ONLY CERTAIN BUSINESS CREDITS AL. AND WITH THAT. THANK YOU MISS PART OF AND I KNOW THAT IDEA IS THAT FOR BOTH THE AND THE NET OPERATING LOSSES AND THE TAX CREDITS THE LIMITATION OF FIVE MILLION IT WOULD ONLY BE FOR THREE YEARS. AND THEN AFTER THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RESUME USING THE CREDIT AND THE AND OUT AND THE NET OPERATING LOSSES IN TERMS OF YOUR VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT- BUT HI AND I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU ANOTHER THE NESTLE MON. AND THEN MISS RUBIO AT THE MISTER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANDMEMBERS WELL I HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THIS BUDGET I AM FOCUSING MY COMMENTS TODAY ON A FEW POINTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT TO THE BANKING COMMITTEE WHICH CHAIR AND AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S COPS. ONLY SIX OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO CITIES AND SIXTEEN OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE RECEIVED A PORTION OF THE FIFTEEN POINT THREE BILLION ALLOCATED TO THE CALIFORNIA TO CALIFORNIA. CARES ACT. DISTRICT ON THE HAS NOT RECEIVED FUNDING. I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT THE MAY REVISED PROVIDE SOME CLARITY. SKEWS ME. ON HOW MUCH COUNTIES CAN EXPECT TO RECEIVE. HIGHER IS THAT WE EXPEDITE THE ALLOCATION OF THESE FUNDS AND TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES. BECAUSE OF IN NINETEEN CRISIS HAS PUSHED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN CLINICS TO THE BRINK OF CLOSURE. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT ONE OUT OF THREE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ARE WORRIED THEY MAY HAVE TO CLOSE THE DOORS IN OUR STATE. ONE CLINIC SANSOM IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS A SOURCE OF HEALTH CARE IN THE REGION IT MAY BE FORCED TO CLOSE ITS DOORS UNLESS ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED. ADDITIONALLY WE MUST KEEP THOSE IN MIND THAT HAVE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR OUR STATE AND THE CENTRAL WORKERS. INCLUDING FARMWORKERS AND THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. I SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE LATINO CAUCUS TO ENSURE I TEN FILERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE EITC PROGRAM. AS CHAIR OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE I SUPPORT THE PROPOSED ENHANCEMENT OF THE DVL WE KNOW THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS ONLY A HEALTH CRISIS BUT ALSO IT'S AN ECONOMIC CRISIS IN TIMES LIKE THESE FINANCIAL PREDATORS AND FRAUDSTERS ARE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. I INTRODUCED A BILL LAST YEAR WE HELD A HEARING ON THIS VERY ISSUE BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THAT ARE EXISTING PIECEMEAL APPROACH TO FINANCIAL REGULATION HAD LEFT MANY GAPS THAT COULD BE EXPLOITED BY BAD ACTORS. I AM HAPPY TO SEE THAT HE D. V. O. ENHANCE ME IN THE MAY REVISED AND HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WHICH REQUIRES NO APPROPRIATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WE CARE ABOUT A FEMINIST BUDGET THAT INCLUDES ACCESS TO CHILDCARE. PAID FAMILY LEAVE SUPPORT FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR WOMEN. WE ARE REQUESTING THE REJECTION OF THE 10% CUT TO THE S. S. R. S. R. OR AN ARM OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES. AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SINGLE REGIONAL EYES RATE STRUCTURE. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. VAST CUTS WERE MADE ACROSS DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. WELL THE STATE RECOVERED CHILDCARE FIELD DID NOT GROW AT THE SAME RATE. APPROXIMATELY 70% OF CHILD CARE CENTERS HAVE CLOSE DURING THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER. UNFORTUNATELY SOME WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RE OPEN. THIS WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON WOMEN AND IT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT WOMEN OF COLOR. WE WANT TO PRESERVE AS MANY CENTERS AS WE CAN. BUT WE MUST ALSO LOOK TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VOUCHERS THAT PROVIDE THE MOST FLEXIBILITY. AS FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO FIND CHILD CARE TO RETURN TO WORK INCLUDING THOSE THAT LIVE IN RURAL AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF CENTERS. MANY WILL RETURN TO THEIR FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. IN CLOSING I BRING UP AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN BUDGETS UP TO. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE FEDERAL CARE IS MANY IS THE ONLY RELIEF FOR THE FEDERAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN PROVIDING SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS WILL STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE MEALS TO CHILDREN IN THE SUMMER AND FALL I URGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND CD TO IDENTIFY AND PLAN TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE AXES TO MEALS AND FOOD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO MISS RUBIO. THAN MISTER GALLAGHER THE MISTER MERCER CHEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I RISE TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AS WELL AS- WOMEN'S CAUCUS MEMBER AND A MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION. TO EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER THE DEVASTATING CUTS IN THE MAY REVISE. SUPPORTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IS THE MOST NOBLE AND MEANINGFUL IMPACT WE CAN MAKE FOR OUR BUDGET I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF FOSTER YOUTH CALIFORNIA SENIORS CHILD CARE REIMBURSEMENTS AND D. H. U. S. WAIVERS TO DISCUSS MY OPPOSITION TO CUTS MADE. PROGRAMS THAT SERVE OUR MOST MODERN BUT HE'S CALIFORNIA'S DO YOU NEED TO NEED OUR HELP NOW MORE THAN EVER. FAMILIES WHO CARE FOR OUR STATE FOSTER YOUTH ARE PCP DIRE SITUATION BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS INCREASING TIME LINES FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES APPROVAL LEAVING FOR LEASE FOR ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH JOB LOSSES AND OTHER IMPACTS OF CLIMATE NINETEEN. WITH FEW RESOURCES TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN. A THE STATE PLACE IN THEIR HOMES. TO CUT THEM NOW AT A TIME WITH A STARK AND EMPLOYMENT MAYBE A SHORT SIGHTED DECISION THE COST THE STATE'S MORE MONEY IN THE END. FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES TAKE CARE OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOSTER KIDS DAILY WHICH IS ONE THIRD OF ALL FOSTER KIDS AND HOMES AND EVER FREE SOCIAL WORKERS. SERVE TO SUPPORT A INTENSIVE SERVICES. FOSTER CARE WHICH INCLUDES SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING SITUATIONS. WITH THE WORK FIRST THAT HAVE 90% OF ITS MEMBERS IDENTIFY AS FEMALE AND IS ALREADY FACING A FIFTY NINE PERCENT. TURNOVER RATE DUE TO LOW WAGES THE ASSEMBLY NEEDS TO CONSIDER THE LONG TERM RAMIFICATIONS OF THESE THESE CUTS. STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT WITH ONE SOCIAL WORKER THERE IS A 75% PERMANENCY RATE FOR FOSTER YOUTH AND THAT DOT DROPS SOCIAL WORKERS. NEXT MAY REVISE DECISION TO ELIMINATE COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS C. D. A. S. AND MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICE PROGRAMS OTHERWISE KNOWN IN AMERICA AS M. S. S. P. MAY HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS IN OUR STATE. THE M. S. S. P. SERVICE TWELVE THOUSAND POOR FRAIL OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILY CARE GIVERS YEARLY. HELPING KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF NURSING HOMES. THE MAJORITY OF THE M. F. S. P. CLIENTS RESIDE ALONG ALONE LIVE ON APPROXIMATE ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH. WITHOUT AN ASSIST P. SERVICES MANY PEOPLE WILL BE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND MOVE INTO NURSING HOMES. RECENT ESTIMATES HAVE SHOWN GREATER THAN ONE THIRD OF US COVERT NINETEEN DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED IN NURSING HOMES A PROBLEM WE STILL HAVE NOT GRASS. WITH EXPERTS PREDICTING A LIKELY SECOND WAVE THIS FALL WE MUST ASK OURSELVES WHAT DIRECT IMPACT WILL THIS DECISION HAVE ON OUR DEATH TOLL. M. F. S. P. AND C. B. EIGHT F. ARE CRUCIAL LONGSTANDING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR OUR SENIOR POPULATION. IN ADDITION TO SENIOR PROGRAM FROM PROGRAM SUPPORTING FOSTER YOUTH I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS OPPOSING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. THE FOR THOSE FAMILIES NEED US RIGHT NOW SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK TO WORK. AND PROPER CHILD CARE WILL ALLOW THEM TO DIESEL. FINALLY AS A MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION WE URGE THE D. H. S. D. H. C. S. TO SUBMIT THE ONE ONE ONE FIVE A WAIVER PROPOSED. TO THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AS MEDICAID SERVICES WAIVER WILL PROVIDE A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR BOARDING CARE RESIDENTS TO COVER COVERT NINETEEN RELATED COSTS. LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN A CLARK HAS SEEN A CLOSER FORTY NINE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND MANY CLOSURES OF RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. BUT THEME THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. THE DEVASTATING PROPORTIONATE CUTS DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER THAN MISTER MERCER TO THE MYSTICAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THIS DISCUSSION TODAY I THINK UNDERSCORES WHY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEED THEIR LEGISLATURE. NOW WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE PURSE. WE HAVE THE POWER OVER POLICY. WE HAVE THE POWER OVER OVERSIGHT AND WE NEED TO USE IT. THIS MAYREVISE IS OFF BASE IT'S TOTALLY OFF BASE AND IT NEEDS THE LEGISLATURE. TO MAKE IT RIGHT. NOW WE HAVE A TOUGH JOB IN FRONT OF US WE'VE ALL EXPRESSED THAT TODAY- DEVASTATING- LOSSES TO OUR GENERAL FUND REVENUES. WE HAVE TOUGH CHOICES TO MAKE BUT WE WILL DO WELL. IF WE STICK TO THIS THEME KEEP OUR PROMISES. AND STICK WITH OUR PRIORITIES. NOW THIS MAY REVISE DOESN'T DO THAT. I KNOW THIS LEGISLATURE ONE THING THAT WE WILL NOT DO IS TURN OUR BACKS ON WILD FIRE VICTIMS. THIS MAY REVISE TAKE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TOWN OF PARADISES WATER DISTRICT IS STRUGGLING TO RECOVER IN THE WAKE OF THE CAMPFIRE. THESE ARE NOT UNSPENT PROGRAM FUNDS THIS WAS A COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR. AND FROM THIS LEGISLATURE TO A TOWN THAT WAS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT. BY THAT FIRE. IT WAS A COMMITMENT OF TWO YEARS OF REVENUE BACK FILL TAX BACK FILL THAT WE'VE DONE FOR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO'VE BEEN RAVAGED BY FIRE AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER COMMUNITY. THAT HAD ITS- VITAL DOLLARS PULLED BACK. LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID TO THE TOWN OF PARADISE. IN THEIR WATER DISTRICT LAST WEEK. WE NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT KEEP YOUR COMMITMENTS ESPECIALLY TO THESE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY WILDFIRES. AND STICK WITH OUR PRIORITIES NOW LET ME LET ME ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF FEDERAL FUNDS BECAUSE NGUYEN ACTUAL WE INQUIRED ABOUT PARADISE ONE OF THE ANSWERS WE GOT BACK WAS WELL THIS IS WHY WE NEED. THE FEDERAL FUNDS. MOTOR THAT MESSAGE TO US THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS CONTINGENT THAT THE STATE'S PROMISED THIS THE PROBLEM THE STATE MADE WITH STATE MONEY IS SOMEHOW CONTINGENT. UPON FEDERAL FUNDING MORE FOLKS IS ALREADY BEEN TWO AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL AID THAT HAS COME THROUGH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE COME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THESE% TRIGGER CUTS ARE COMPLETELY BOGUS AND ANY TO BE CALLED OUT FOR THAT. SAYING THAT EDUCATION WILL HAVE TO TAKE THESE HUGE CUTS. IS EDUCATION A PRIORITY OR NOT. THIS LEGISLATURE'S ALWAYS MADE IT A PRIORITY WE WILL CONTINUE BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT EDUCATION BUDGET. FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ARE BEING USED IN THIS MAY AND THIS MAY REVISE FEDERAL FUNDS. FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. AND YET WE ARE CUTTING K. THROUGH TWELVE GENERAL FUND PROP NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION MONEY BY 14% WHILE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS IN PROJECTIONS ARE ONLY DOWN EIGHT PERCENT. WERE MAKE AN EVEN BIGGER CUTS EDUCATION WHEN THE FEDS OF STEPPED UP THIS GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE STEPS BACK. WE TALK ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF COME IN. LET ME JUST DETAIL IT FOR YOU THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR SO OR SORRY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF COME IN TO HELP SUPPORT. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TO SUPPORT THE UC SYSTEM. THREE HUNDRED AND NINE. MILLION DOLLARS HAVE COME IN TO SUPPORT THE CSU SYSTEM. FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE COME IN TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT THEY GET A 10% CUT. IN THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE MADE A PRIORITY GET A 50% CUT. IN THIS MAY REVISED BUDGET. THAT'S NOT A PRIORITY. THAT'S NOT MAKING EDUCATION A PRIORITY THE FEDS OF STEPPED UP THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET STEPS BACK. AND WE IN THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO MAKE THAT RIGHT. I HOPE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WE ALWAYS HAVE DONE. USING OUR CONSTITUTIONALLY GIVEN POWER TO MAKE THIS RIGHT THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU. THE FORMER SEARCHING. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AS A STATE LEGISLATOR AND AS A PARENT OF A FIFTH GRADER. NOTHING BREAKS MY HEART MORE THAN CUTTING OUR FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. I SUPPORT K. THROUGH TWELVE FUNDING AS OUR STATE'S HIGHEST BUDGET PRIORITY. IN THIS TIME OF BUDGETARY CRISIS WE MUST PRIORITIZE OUR CORE GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS. OUR CORD GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE OUR SCHOOLS. AT A TIME WHEN OUR SCHOOLS ARE FACING INCREASED COSTS IN DEALING WITH THE CALL OF IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE NEED TO GIVE OUR SCHOOLS MORE NOT LESS RESOURCES. WE CANNOT FULLY RE OPEN OUR ECONOMY WITHOUT RE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS. MANY CALIFORNIANS CANNOT GET BACK TO WORK WITHOUT OUR SCHOOLS RE OPENING. THIS PANDEMIC HAS CLEARLY UNDERSCORED HOW OUR SCHOOLS AND NOT JUST PROVIDE EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN. BUT ALSO CHILD CARE BEFORE SCHOOL DURING SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL FOR WORKING FAMILIES. OUR SCHOOLS PROVIDE MEALS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES STRUGGLING DURING THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS. OUR SCHOOLS PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER VITAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OUR CHILDREN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS. OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE MUST GIVE OUR SCHOOLS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO RE OPEN IN THE FALL. MOST FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. WE NEED TO FIND L. C. F. F. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WE MUST ALSO DISTRIBUTE FEDERAL CARES ACT FUNDING IN A FAIR AND ETHICAL ROLE WAY TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE THE COLBERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OVERRIDING PURPOSE OF THE CARES ACT FUNDING IS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS FUNDING NEEDS TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO HELP ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT FOR OUR CHILDREN AND SCHOOL STAFF WHETHER FOR NECESSARY PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES. OR TO MAKE DISTANCE LEARNING WORK FOR ALL STUDENTS. TO THIS END I ASK. THAT THE FEDERAL CARES ACT DOLLARS BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASED ON THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO MR COOLEY- THAN MR KILEY IN THE LOCAL DOCTOR MISS FOR ORDER. HEALY IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU IN THIS HOUSE. I THINK WE ARE. FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOU THERE I KNOW YOU WERE CLOSE TO CONVERSATIONS BACK IN THE LAST BIG DOWNTURN- TWO THOUSAND NINE. TEN ELEVEN. THAT THERE IS ON MY MIND TODAY I THINK WE GET A LOT OF REALIGNMENT BACK AT THAT PERIOD A LOT OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES GOT REALIGNED TO THE COUNTIES. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE QUARANTINE THE SHELTER AT HOME. DRAMATIC IMPACTS ON LOCAL. BUSINESSES WHICH MEANS SALES TAX SO WE HAVE SOME POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN ROLLED OUT% THEY'RE GOING TO IMPACT LOCAL REVENUES AND THE SERVICES FOR KIDS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTIES.

THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO MR KILEY THAN THIS BOERNER HORVATH. THANK YOU AS I HAVE A FOUR MINUTES TO ADDRESS OF TWO HUNDRED THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET I'M GONNA FOCUS ON ONE LINE ITEM. AND THAT IS TWENTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOUR EDT THE I. R. INDIO J. TO ENFORCE LAST YEAR'S ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS IS. IT'S TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO TAKE AIM AT SMALL BUSINESSES. TO AUDIT AND PROSECUTE THEM DEFINE AND PENALIZE THEM TO BOLDLY AND HARASS THEM WHEN THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IT'S TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO FINISH THE JOB OF DECIMATING A COMMUNITY OF INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONALS AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA ITSELF SPENDING HUNDREDS OF PROFESSIONS MANY OF THE MOST TALENTED PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. AND MANY OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. IT'S TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SHUT DOWN GAINFUL WORK AND DESTROYED LIVELIHOODS WHEN THERE ARE MORE UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS THEN HE ENTIRE POPULATION OF HALF THE STATES. IN THE COUNTRY. ONE SUCH CALIFORNIAN IS A WOMAN NAMED MONICA. I AM A SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD CANCER SURVIVOR MONICA WROTE. AB FIVE DESTROYED MY LIFE TAKING MY OVER THE PHONE INTERPRETER JOB. WHO WILL HIRE A SIX SENIOR LIKE ME. I WAS MAKING GOOD MONEY TAKING MY BREAKS WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT. DURING MY CHEMOTHERAPY THIS JOB WAS MY SALVATION AGAINST OPPRESSION IT MADE ME FEEL USEFUL. HELPING PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS PHARMACIES HOTELS RENTAL COMPANIES IMMIGRATION AGENCIES AND MUCH MORE. WHEN I WAS INTERPRETING I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING IN MY LIFE. SINCE JANUARY I LIVE WITH DEPRESSION. SOME DAYS I DON'T HAVE STRENGTH TO GET UP IN THE MORNING I JUST CRAWL AND CRIED BECAUSE FOR EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN WAKING UP TO LOG IN AND START TO WORK. SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD DIE MY NAME IS MONICA AND THIS IS MY AB FIVE STORY. GOVERNOR NEWSOME DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONICA THAT'S CLEAR FROM THIS BUDGET. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS DENIED THAT PEOPLE LIKE MONICA EVEN EXIST. GOVERNOR NEW SOME IS ALL TOO WILLING TO CREATE MANY MORE MONICA AS AS A RICH REWARD FOR THE SPECIAL INTERESTS WITH THE MOST JEWS AT THIS CAPITAL. IT'S TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ONE OF LINE ITEM. ONE LINE ITEM IN A SPRAWLING BUDGET YET THERE IS SO MUCH DISHONOR PACKED INTO THAT ONE LINE WE'LL MORE TIGHTLY THAN A STRAND OF DNA. IT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S BECOME OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. NO SERIOUS PERSON. HONESTLY BELIEVES ON THE MERITS IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO PASS EIGHTY FIVE MUCH LESS TO INVEST IN ITS ENFORCEMENT WHEN WE HAVE A RECORD ON EMPLOYMENT AND- A RECORD DEFICIT. THE FOUNDER OF THE LIBERAL DAILY KOS TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE. CALL AB FIVE DISASTROUS AND ITS SUPPORTERS SHAMEFUL. GAVIN NEWSOM'S OWN FORMER DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF YOU CHARLIE SAID IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE PIECES OF LEGISLATION IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PHD ECONOMISTS ROAD OPEN LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR SAYING AB FIVE IS DOING ITS SUBSTANTIAL AND AVOIDABLE HARM THIRTY VERY PEOPLE WHO NOW HAVE THE FEWEST RESOURCES AND THE WORST ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO THEM. THIS TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS DEFIES EXPERT OPINION COMMON SENSE AND BASIC HUMAN DECENCY. GOVERNOR NEW SOME MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. I ASK YOU TO REMOVE THIS FUNDING AND REPEAL THIS WALL. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO NEXT TO MISS BOERNER HORVATH MISS GONZALEZ AND THEN MR FLORA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK YOU'VE DONE TO BRING US HERE TODAY TO ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST. BOOK BUT THAT. EVER WORKED ON. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE IN THE COMING WEEKS WILL DETERMINE THE PATH OF ECONOMIC EVERY. FOR CALIFORNIA THE MOST IMPORTANT. HOW FAIR AND EQUITABLE THIS RECOVERY WILL BE. ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENT. OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT SUPPORT OF. FEMINIST BUDGET FOR ME A MOTHER A FEMINIST BUDGET MEANS THREE I MERRY THINGS. WE SHOULD PROP TIES FUNDING TO CHILDCARE K. TWELVE EDUCATION. THESE CUTS. THE CARD AND THE CURRENT BUDGET MEAN THAT WOMEN WHO ARE BY AND LARGE ARE THE PRIMARY CARETAKERS OF OUR CHILDREN MEAN WOMEN WILL WILL REMAIN OUT OF THE WORKFORCE EVEN AS OUR ECONOMY RE OPENS AND RECOVERS. AS IT IS NOW WOMEN MAKE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE CLAIMING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THIS IS THE TIME WHICH CARE CENTERS AND SCHOOLS NEED TO DO MORE NOT LESS TO HELP OUR KIDS RETURN TO SCHOOL FIVE DAYS A WEEK WITH APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL DISTANCING INCREASE SANITATION AND INNOVATIVE CURRICULUM. THIS CAN ONLY BE REPORTER TRIES FUNDING TO SCHOOLS AS LONG AS KIDS ARE NOT BACK IN SCHOOL OR IN CHILDCARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK WOMEN WILL REMAIN OUT OF THE WORKFORCE FURTHER INCREASING. WORKFORCE WHAT DO YOU PAY INEQUITY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT SO HARD OVER THE LAST DECADES. TO ACHIEVE. TO BE HONEST I CAME TO SACRAMENTO TO FIGHT FOR A BETTER WORLD. FOR MY DAUGHTER. WHEN ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY THAT I HAD GROWING UP THE MANY OF THE WOMEN HERE EXPERIENCED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND ADULTHOOD AND CAREERS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE GAMES THAT WOMEN HAVE MADE IN THE WORKPLACE ARE NOT SET BACK. A DECADE OR MORE. BY THE BUDGET. NOT APPROPRIATE PRIORITIZE K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE OUR GIRLS AND ALL THE CHURCH CALIFORNIA DESERVE BETTER. CERTAINLY THERE'S TO BE. HOW TO DO THIS BY PRIORITIZING FUNDING IS THE FIRST STEP. SECOND WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN RETRAINING AND WORK SHARE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WOMEN AND LOW SKILL WORKERS ARE PROJECTED TO BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IN THE MEN ALONG MID AND LONG TERM IMPACTS OF COVE IN NINETEEN RECESSION. WE DID THAT NOW AN INNOVATIVE TRAINING ROOM SOME WORK SURE PROGRAMS THEY CAN BETTER HANDLE A PROJECTED SECOND SEARCH OF THE CORONAVIRUS. BY PRIOR TO ME COLLEGE IN FUNDING NOW WE COULD INCREASE OUR BE NUMBER OF IT RETRAINING TO ADDRESS ALL THE- WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK WORK. THE BETTER INVEST TAXPAYER MONEY KEEPING PEOPLE EMPLOYED WHICH WILL ACCELERATE RECOVERY IN THE LONG TERM. THESE CHOICES ARE CHOICES WE MADE TODAY THAT AFFECT THE ABILITY TO SAFELY AND SWIFTLY. AS POSSIBLE RECOVER JOBS WHICH SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY OF OUR BODY. AND THIRD WE SHOULD MAINTAIN INVESTMENTS IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO BE HONEST AT SOMETHING VERY LONG PLANNED TO SAY ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE INTEREST OF ALL OF OUR TIME. I'M JUST GOING SAY DITTO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SANTA ROSA. HE NAILED IT. SO THESE MY FRIENDS ARE THE PRIORITIES OF WHAT I CONSIDER FROM BUDGET. COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. IF YOU WERE GONNA GO TO MISS A GONZALEZ. THE MISTER FLORA THE MISTER RODRIGUEZ AND AGAIN JUST REMIND PEOPLE. THAT WE DO HAVE WITNESSES FEEL FREE TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS TO THE WITNESSES. IT'S GONZALEZ THANK YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST- AS CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LATINO CAUCUS IT WOULD BE REMISS TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BUDGET FOR ARE UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS. AND WHY THIS IS SUCH A PROBLEM IS WE KNOW THAT IN PARTICULAR I ITS HAND I TEND FILERS THE BEANS ARE ACTUALLY FILING. ON TAXES THAT THEY'VE EARNED IN THIS STATE. ARE THE ONLY GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO GET NOTHING BACK. DESPITE PAYING MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS STATE AND LOCAL TAXES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND IN MY COMMUNITY AND SO MANY LIKE YOURS THAT HAVE A LOT OF MAKE STATUS HOUSEHOLDS. A DOUBLE CHECK PRETTY. IF THEY'RE MARRIED TO SOMEBODY WHO'S EVEN A U. S. CITIZEN THAT US CITIZEN DIDN'T EVEN GET A STIMULUS CHECK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY CAN'T GET UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THEIR U. S. BORN CHILDREN ARE GETTING NOTHING AT ALL. IT IS JUST INJUSTICE THAT THESE TAX PAYERS CAN'T ACCESS THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. IT HAS BEEN GOING ON TOO LONG AND WE'VE ALL SEEN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LEAVE THAT WERE VERY GREAT. THIS ADMINISTRATION CAME UP WITH. KIND OF PANIC THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE COMMUNITIES WHICH FOR THE LAST WEEK HAS RESULTED IN EIGHT AM THROUGH EIGHT PM PHONE CALLS TO NONPROFITS TO GET FIVE DOLLAR JUST ONE TIME. THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT HELLO CHECK THE LIVES. OF OUR TAX PAYING. SENSUAL WORK IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAPPEN BE UNDOCUMENTED WE HOPE THAT WE CONSIDER THIS BUDGET. I ALSO RISE AS A SUPPORT OF A FEMINIST BUDGET AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUE PROMOTE FROM ENCINITAS I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT RECOVERING IF WE DON'T TALK ABOUT OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR CHILD CARE FACILITY OPENING. WHEN I FIRST RAN OFFICE I RAN AS A WORKING SINGLE MOM- THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF THOSE DURING THOSE DAYS I KNOW WE HAVE A COUPLE NOW I AM NO LONGER A SINGLE MOM. THIS I FIRST TWO ASIANS WERE HEARING FROM OUR SCHOOLS TWICE A WEEK HALF DAYS. THERE IS NO WAY FOR WOMEN TO RETURN TO WORK. AND I KNOW IT COULD BE MEN AS WELL. BUT DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN HAVE PICKED UP THE SCROLL AT HOME. AND ARE TAKING CARE. I KNOW THAT SO MANY OF US ON THE FLOOR TODAY ARE DOING DOUBLE DUTY OF TRYING TO WORK FULL TIME. TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN AT HOME AND BE A HOME SCHOOL PARENT. ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE AND I WORRY ABOUT ANY ECONOMY COMING BACK. WHEN HALF THE WORKFORCE CAN'T ACTUALLY WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHILDREN SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AT HOME. IT'S A PROBLEM. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST I DO WANT TO BRING UP AND SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE VICE CHAIRS POINT. ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IN THE LOAN THAT WILL BECOME DO PROBABLY IN TWO YEARS IF IT'S NORMAL. TIME PERIOD. AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THIS QUESTION WE KNOW THAT A REPORT DONE BY UC BERKELEY SHOWED US. THAT COMPANY JUST. BENEATH COULD BE MISSED. THEIR WORKERS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS- OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. TO COME. WE KNOW THAT MONEY GOING TO EDT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH AB FIVE INSURERS THE COMPANIES WHO HAVE NOT PAID INTO OUR EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. AND NOW HAVE TO BE FORCED TO BUY WHY DOES THAT MATTER THAT MEANS THAT LAW ABIDING COMPANIES THOSE COMPANIES WHO BEEN PAIN IN OVER THE LAST DECADE ARE NOT GONNA BE FOOTING THE BILL FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE CHEATED OUR PROGRAMS. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE HAVE RULES IN CALIFORNIA WE REALIZE THAT IF YOU DON'T ABIDE BY THE UP. THANK YOU HURT THE LAW ABIDING MISS IT WHO HAVE WHO AND WILL IN THE FUTURE I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN TO GO AFTER THOSE COMPANIES THAT FOR YEARS. IT ARE SURE FIND OUT. POSTED ALL. HE'S STILL IN ME IN THE STATE TO GO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ASK FOR A LOAN IT FOR LESS MONEY AND FOR. IN THE US AND I HOPE WE HAVE A TO GO THOSE COMPANIES AS WELL TO HELP WITH FUTURE BUDGET. REQUEST WITH THAT A QUESTION DIRECTED TO SOMEBODY TO MISS. WITH HIS FATHER ON THE FRONT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YEAH I THINK THAT I AM CLEARLY THAT THE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES- IS REALLY COMING INTO CLEAR FOCUS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN- I HAVE THAT ARE NOT EMPLOYEES ARE GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY PANDEMIC AND EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS A SPECIAL PERMIT IS NOT. BASED PROGRAM I'M THESE ARE THE KIND OF. THAT WE THE NET OF EMPLOYMENT- A BASKET OF GOODS THAT WE ALL PAY INTO AND I THINK IT'S REALLY BEING CLEAR WHY THEY ARE SO IMPORTANT- FOR EXTRAORDINARY TIMES THE SO- IN TERMS OF YOUR REQUEST ABOUT GOING AFTER THOSE COMPANIES WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET ON THAT. OBVIOUSLY WE ARE PLAN CONTINUE. FOURTH MEANT. PROGRAM THAT POSED IN JANUARY THAT WAS A PRIORITY TO MAINTAIN IN MAY- AND I'M HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR SPECIFIC REQUESTS. THANK YOU BURGER MISTER FLORA THE MISTER RODRIGUEZ AND THEN MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IT'S- GOOD TO BE BACK ON THE FLOOR WITH YOU TODAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND REALLY THIS TIME OF THE DAY MOST OF MY COMMENTS OF ALL OF IT BOB DYLAN MADE BUT I LIKE ALSO DOCTOR WOULD HAVE THE CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY HEALTH- ON THIS PROP FIFTY SIX- READ. I'M DIRECTING A FINDS IT IS FASCINATING TO ME COMING FROM A CENTRAL VALLEY A LOWER INCOME COMMUNITY- JUST LAST YEAR WE FOUGHT VERY VERY HARD TO PUT IT SERVICES COVERED BACK UP MEDI CAL. AND NOW ON YOUR LATER IT'S ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AND SO I THINK FOR ME IN NOT UNDERSTANDING THIS SIGNIFICANT OF JUST THAT ONE ASPECT OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IMPOSSIBLE SYSTEM IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT I SERVICE THIS I WANT IT IS DIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS WOULD BE. THE MOST. TO BE TO UP AND GET OUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IMPORTANT REGARDING TO LEGAL WERE. SO HAVING THAT STRIPPED OUT OF MEDI CAL- I THINK IS DEVASTATING SIMPLY ONE YEAR AFTER- IT WAS PUT IN AND IT WAS STRIPPED OUT INTO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN THE LAST RECESSION AND WE JUST WERE ABLE TO GET BACK IN LAST YEAR SO THAT AS FAR AS- VERY VERY. CLOSE EYE ON. IT IN THE SECOND SITUATION I WANT TO JUST BRING UP. IS THE CLOSURE OF THESE TO PRISON FACILITIES. YOU KNOW I GIVEN THE VOLATILITY. AND THE SERIES NATURE OF THESE OFFENDERS. A LOT OF TIMES IT'S MY COMMUNITY. THAT TAKES A LOT OF THESE FOLKS BACK IN. IT'S MY COMMUNITY THAT THEY COME BACK TO. AND MANY MANY TIMES EVEN TODAY ON THE FLOOR WE TALK ABOUT. THE RIGHTS OF THE PROOF. THE PRESS SAFE. I'M ALL. I WHEN THEY CARS TO. WE SHOULD HAVE. THE BEST INCARCERATIONS SYSTEM THAT WE AND- WE SHOULD PROTECT. FOLKS WELL. NOT STATE. PAUL BUT- WE'RE MISS. IS THAT OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE TO BE SAFE WELL. IN WE'RE VERY LONG TIME. I'VE BEEN THIS BILL SINCE BEEN ELECT. WE'VE DONE REALIGNMENT WE'VE REDUCED OUR PRISON POPULATION WE'VE PUT PEOPLE BACK IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE. YOU KNOW ABLE TO COPE WITH THAT SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THE CLOSURE OF THESE TWO PRESENTS AND THEN SIMPLY WHAT TO PRISONS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVEN'T EVEN IDENTIFY THOSE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. SO REALLY THOSE ARE MY TWO CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THEY MISS RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS AS CHAIR OF THE INLAND EMPIRE CAUCUS THIS YEAR I KNOWN SPEAK FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR ENTIRE STATE RECOVERS WITH EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND ASSISTANCE WILL MAKE TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEES TO ENSURE WE ARE SUPPORTING ARE VULNERABLE REGIONS EVERYONE NEEDS GET THEIR FAIR SHARE. BUDGET MUST BE WITH EVERY UNIT IN MIND WRITING A BUDGET IS A SERIOUS CHALLENGE. BUT A SOUL IS IMPORTANT THE IMPACT ON RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE IN LOW AND WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS. ARSON SOCIAL SAFETY NET MUST BE PROTECTED AND PROGRAMS TO MOVE THE ECONOMY MUST BE INCREASED. OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS HAS BEEN MADE MORE CHALLENGING SOLUTIONS LIKE EXPANDING THE TYPES OF HOUSING CARES ACT FUNDING CAN BE APPLIED TO WILL BE ESSENTIAL. IN PARTICULAR I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY. THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING THE CLOSURE OF TO STATE PRISONS WHEN THIS YEAR. I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN THE STATE PRISON IN CHINO. THIS FACILITY HAS MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES ALONG WITH THE HIGHEST INFECTION RATES OF COVERT NINETEEN IN THE STATE. THE FACILITY IS A NIGHTMARE HOWEVER TO CLOSE TO PRISONS MEANS ADDING MORE INMATES TO CHINO THIS IS DANGEROUS WITHOUT NEEDED UPGRADES AND IMPROVEMENTS. MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION IS TO THE PARMA FINANCE. WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO UPGRADE CURRENT FACILITIES SUCH AS GINO TO COUNT FOR HIGHER POPULATION. THANK YOU. I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS- THE GOVERNOR'S MAY PROVISION DOES PRIORITIZE PUBLIC SAFETY ABSOLUTELY- THAT THE SAVINGS THAT I YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING BEEN SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON PUBLIC SAFETY PROPOSALS MANY YEARS AGO DURING THE LAST RECESSION WHAT USUALLY WITH THE DYNAMICIS REALLY A SPLASHING OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE OTHER YOU KNOW MAINTAIN THE REST OF THE PERSON OPERATIONS AND IN THIS CASE THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A REAL RECOGNITION BY THIS BODY- AT AS WELL AS THE AS THE GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AT. THE TIME THAT WE DO HAVE INMATES IN OUR PRESS IS THAT THEY ARE WORKING TOWARDS REHABILITATION AND THEN WILL BE RELEASED TO COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE COMMUNITY SAFE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY LEAVE HAVE LEADS US PROGRAM. ONE PER. IN OUR IN OUR BUDGET TO I. WERE COST IN THE PER SYSTEM AND AT THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WITH WAS ON THE PAROLE TERMS THIS IS AN EVIDENCE BASED- PROPOSAL- TO LIMIT THE- CAP THE PAROLE TERMS FOR A LOT OF INMATES AT. AT TWO YEARS- AND THE IDEA THERE IS THAT MOST INMATES AND WHAT MOST OFFENDERS WHO. PRESIDENT BE AN ISSUE TO USE ON THE VERY FIRST FEW MONTHS AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN BORNE OUT BY RESEARCH. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY IN THIS AREA. I'M IN TERMS OF OUR PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND THIS BODY- AS WELL THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN PRIORITIZING I'M ESPECIALLY THE- FIXING OF ROOFS AND PRESENT THE CELL AND PRISON KITCHEN FACILITIES WHICH ARE SOME OF THE MORE IT YOU KNOW IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF THE INMATES AND SO THE STAFF- AND SAID THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE CONTINUING- ADD AT THE ROUTE THE MULTI YEAR- BUT NOT AT THE LEVELS THAT WE HAD HOPED. TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS BUT THOSE THOSE CONTINUE TO BE PRIORITY EXPENDITURES THERE NECESSARY IN TO MAKE. HELL IT'S SAFE. I'M JUST ONE SALE LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE THIRD RIGHT NOW. AND KEEP THOSE INSTITUTIONAL POPULATIONS- THE SAFE AND SAID THAT THERE BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY IT'S A PROBLEM THAT CAN MOVE VERY QUICKLY. THROUGH AN INSTITUTION AND SO THAT AND IN A IN A BEEN A HIGH PRIORITY- INCLUDING STOPPING INTAKE- FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW THAT'S ACTUALLY SO. TO ROUTE. FROM THE GYM OF BUT THAT ALSO COULD USE TO BE SOMETHING THAT WERE WATCHING CLOSELY. THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT GONNA GO TO MISTER BERMAN THAT WE HAVE MISSED THREE OF US MISS AGUIAR-CURRY AND MISS QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M PROUD OF HOW QUICKLY CALIFORNIA MOVED TO RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CORONA VIRUS AND TAKE MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE THAT IS DONE. AS WE REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS AND LONG LASTING NATURE OF THIS PANDEMIC I'M ALSO PROUD OF A QUICKLY RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON OUR NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. AND THE NEED TO UPDATE OUR ELECTIONS PROCEDURES TO UPHOLD THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE THAT NO CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE TO RISK IN THEIR HEALTH AND POSSIBLY THEIR LIFE. TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE. WE MUST AVOID THE BOTTLE THAT WE SAW ON WISCONSIN WHERE VOTERS WERE DISENFRANCHISED WHEN THEY WERE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE SAFETY OF THEIR HOMES. AND THE UNKNOWN RISKS VOTING IN PERSON. IN EARLY APRIL I'M AT AB EIGHT SIXTY TO REQUIRE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA VOTER. RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL AND HAVE THE OPTION TO VOTE FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOME. IN EARLY MAY THE GOVERNOR FOLLOWED THIS WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REQUIRE THE SAME. BOTH MY BILL AND THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN IN PERSON VOTING OPTIONS FOR THOSE WHO NEED. FOR MILLIONS OF VOTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THIS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT TO THE WAY THEY HAVE VOTED FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE VOTER CONFUSION. IF THIS CONFUSION LEADS TO CALIFORNIANS NOT VOTING OUT OF FRUSTRATION THEN ALL WE'VE DONE IS UNINTENTIONALLY DISENFRANCHISE A DIFFERENT GROUP OF VOTERS. THAT IS WHY A STATEWIDE VOTER EDUCATION AND INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT EVERY VOTER IN CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDS THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION. THIS CAMPAIGN MUST INCLUDE DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TV ADS DIRECT MAIL AND RADIO AND STREAMING AUDIO AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS CONDUCTED WITH APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE ACCESS. I KNOW THAT THEIR ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR OUR GENERAL ELECTION. AND WHILE THEY'RE HEALTHY DISAGREEMENTS AS TO HOW MUCH THAT BUDGET ADJUSTMENT SHOULD BE I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DIRECTOR BALLS ALERT. FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND RECOGNITION THAT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT NO CALIFORNIA GETS DISAGREEMENT DISENFRANCHISE THIS NOVEMBER EITHER DUE TO FEAR OF IN PERSON VOTING OR DUE TO CONFUSION ABOUT THE NEW VOTING YEARS. THANKS. THANK YOU MISTER RIVERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TO OUR COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MISTER SPEAKER AND ALL OF THE STAFF THAT MADE THIS HEARING POSSIBLE UNDER THESE CHALLENGING CERTAIN STANCES ON THERE JUST A FEW ITEMS THAT I WON WOULD LIKE TO DRAW SPECIAL ATTENTION TO AS WE WORK OVER THE BUDGET IN THESE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. FIRST CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO ALREADY DISCUSSED THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA SOCIETY AND ECONOMY AND ARE ESTIMATED TO PAY MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES INCLUDING INCOME TAXES AND PROPERTY TAXES. AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE EXTEND THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE TAX FILERS OF THESE WE ARE GENERATING REVENUE FROM THIS COMMUNITY YEAH WE EXCLUDE THEM FROM ALL THE PROGRAMS IN THIS BUDGET AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK SHOULD BE DOING THEY'RE NOT JUST OUR CONSTITUENTS AS A LATINO CAUCUS MEMBER BUT FOR MANY OF YOU IN THE ROOM THESE ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO. BUT YOU SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO HOMELESSNESS AS IT RELATES TO THE BUDGET. EARLIER THIS YEAR OUR GOVERNOR SPENT HIS WHOLE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- AND IT'S AN A AND A CRISIS IN OUR STATE- AND IT STILL IS. AND MAYBE EVEN MORE NOW WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN SITUATION. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE MET WITH DOZENS OF STAKEHOLDERS STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES THAT ALL UP ECHO THE SAME SENTIMENT. WE MUST CREATE ONE CENTRALIZED OFFICE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO COORDINATE THE STATE'S RESPONSE ON HOMELESSNESS WELL STATE FUNDING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESSNESS. FUNDING ALONE WILL SOLVE THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. I LOOK FORWARD TO OF DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND- AS WE SEEK TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES ON HOMELESSNESS. NEXT ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND AS A WOMAN OF COLOR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BUDGET THAT REFLECTS FEMINIST PRIORITIES INCLUDING ACCESS TO CHILDCARE PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR ALL WOMEN. THESE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUES TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO LIVE IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS A MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION AT HOME TO THIS THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN OUR STATE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED. I HOPE TO SEE GREATER EQUITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS FOR STUDENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE DISABILITIES. STUDENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE DISABILITIES INCLUDE STUDENTS WITH AUTISM- DEAF EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. OTHER DISABILITIES THAT ONLY SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE MORE OF THE STUDENTS AND AVE TO EDUCATE THE STUDENTS AND WE WANT TO EDUCATE BUT WE NEED EQUITABLE FUNDING TO ASSURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND FUNDING SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS WHO ARE PROVIDING SERVICES. AND POSE IN THE MAY REVISION SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DO NOT SERVE ANY STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE AN EQUAL SHARE AS THOSE WHO DO. FINALLY TODAY I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY SCHOOL MEALS AND AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE STEPPED UP AND PROVIDED GRABBING GO MEALS TO ALL CHILDREN IN THEIR AREA AND MANY FAMILIES WITHOUT CHILDREN I HAD INTRODUCED LEGISLATION EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT WAS ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOL LUNCHES WERE PROVIDED FOR FREE FOR ALL LOW INCOME CHILDREN WITHOUT ANY COPAY OR THE TYPE OF CD. I ALSO HAD A BILL THAT WAS TRYING TO MAKE COULD IDENTIFY HOMELESS CHILDREN WHO OFTEN GO HUNGRY AND DEPEND ON SCHOOL MEALS AS THEIR ONLY MEAL FOR THAT HEY. WHAT WHAT MY BILLS WERE HELD THIS YEAR WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THIS BUDGET TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR GREAT STATE DON'T GO HUNGRY. ULTIMATELY WE WILL BE JUDGED BY THE DECISIONS WE MAKE IN THE WEEKS TO COME I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT NO CHILD SHOULD GO HUNGRY. OR WITHOUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD THANK YOU THANK YOU REAGAN THIS AGUIAR-CURRY THAN THIS. QUIRK SILVA AND THEN MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TING IN MEMBERS. WE ARE UNION PRESS ATTEND THE TIME ALL OF US PUTTING OUR JANUARY PLANS AND ASPIRATIONS AWAY AND REFOCUSING TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF OUR STATE AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WILDFIRES IN OUR DISTRICTS YEAR AFTER YEAR STATE EMERGENCIES ARE BECOMING ENORMOUS. PLUS EVEN UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOU REPRESENT SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES YOU REALIZE ACCESS IS EVERYTHING. BECAUSE OF THIS MY PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATOR HAVE BEEN THE SAME IT WILL STAY THE SAME. THEY ARE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN HEALTH CARE. THE CIVIC PLEA TELEHEALTH. IT IS FELT IT'S TAKEN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC TO BRING THIS TO THE pBY MY CONSTITUENTS AND NOW YOURS CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONLY WAY FOR MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE EDUCATION TRAINING AG. POST PANDEMIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND MUCH MORE. WITHOUT BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY PEOPLE IN SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE AMONGST THE POOREST AND SICKEST CALIFORNIANS WILL FALL FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND URBAN AND SUBURBAN PEERS. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AB FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR WHICH TODAY HAS MADE SURE THE TELEHEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN REIMBURSED DURING AN EMERGENCY. I AUTHORED AB SEVEN FORTY FOUR THREE CARTEL HEALTH PAYMENT PARITY WHICH HAS BECOME A LIFELINE TO OUR STATE'S PHYSICIANS PRACTICES. THESE TELEHEALTH LAWS CRITICAL TO MY CONSTITUENTS AXES HAVE GIVEN ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ACCESS TO CARE AND CONTINUITY OF CARE DURING THE CALL BUT NINETEEN CRISIS. THIS BUDGET MUST PROTECT THAT ACCESS TO CARE FOR ALL COMMUNITIES URBAN AND RURAL BUT LACK ACCESS. TELL HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT IN MEDI CAL SHOULD NOT BE CONTINGENT ON A STATE WIDE DISASTER THE TELEHEALTH PARITY MUST BE REALIZED. FURTHER I STAND AGAIN FLUSHING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THIS WOULD UNDERCUT THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE IN THE MID A SAFETY NET PROGRAM FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TODAY IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL POST CLOVER. ON BEHALF OF THE WOMAN'S CAUCUS WE CARE ABOUT A FEMINIST BUDGET THAT INCLUDES ACCESS TO CHILDCARE PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. AS YOU KNOW ARE UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES ARE ON THE FRONT LINES AT EVERY ESSENTIAL FUNCTION DURING THIS CRISIS. THEY HAVE BEEN HIT HARD BY COBIT BOTH FINANCIALLY. AND WITH REGARDS TO THE HEALTH. WE CANNOT LEAVE THEM OUT OF A OUT OF OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE INCLUDING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH WILL NOT COMPENSATE THEM FOR BEING EXPOSED AND DURING SHELTER ORDERS BUT AT LEAST AT LEAST WILL NOT COMPLETELY ABANDON THEM WHEN THEY NEED. OUR HELP THE MOST. WE KNOW THAT THERE MUST BE SIGNIFICANT CUTS DEFERRALS OF OUR DREAMS WHICH IT SEEMS SO ATTAINABLE FOUR MONTHS AGO. HOWEVER WE MUST PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS THAT WE LITERALLY CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR STATES PEOPLE AND ECONOMY. THE AXIS OF OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES RELY ON AND THE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND ECONOMIC HEALTH OF OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE INCHES FROM THE BRINK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO IN THIS QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU- MS SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A HISTORIC COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS TO LISTEN AND TO HEAR OTHERS PRIORITIES TO HEAR FROM OUR EXPERTS AND TO LEARN. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR SENIORS. OUR DISABLED COMMUNITIES. OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND WE NEED TO FULLY INVEST IN EDUCATION. WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES AS WE KNOW THOSE ARE CALIFORNIA VALUES. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP OUR PROMISE WE NEED TO KEEP OUR PROMISE TO NOT SUPPORT A BUDGET THAT RATES ARE GAS TAX. WE MADE THAT PROMISE TO OUR CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND I WILL NOT SUPPORT A BUDGET THAT DOES THAT. HOWEVER I WILL SUPPORT A BUDGET THE GETS CALIFORNIANS WORKING. I WANT TO FOCUS MY BUDGET PROP PRIORITIES ON. ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND INVESTING IN CHILD CARE. WHEN WE LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS IN HOUSING THOSE TWO ISSUES GO TOGETHER WE MUST BUILD AND WE MUST BUILD QUICKLY AS WE KNOW THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS MANY ARE HOMELESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF WE DO RETURN TO SOME TYPE OF NORMALCY ARE HOMELESS POPULATION IS GOING TO HAVE INCREASED WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW MANY ARE ON THE VERGE OF EVICTIONS SO WE MUST WE MUST LOOK AT. DOING WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID IN JANUARY WHICH IS USING OUR STATE LANDS. TO HOUSE PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO YOU HOUSE PEOPLE AND ECONOMIC WAY THAT STREAMLINES HOUSING AND BUILDING. MENTAL HEALTH WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A PRIORITY AND YET THE COST OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTIES IN OUR CITIES ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHEN PEOPLE NOW ARE SUFFERING FROM SOME TYPE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THEY ARE TYPICALLY. GO TO EMERGENCY ROOMS OR ARE RESTED AND I IN OUR IN OUR COUNTY JAILS THIS IS A HUGE COST TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE NEED TO MAKE MENTAL HEALTH JUST THE SAME PRIORITY AS HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH GO TOGETHER. THIRD I WANT TO FOCUS ON CHILD CARE AS THE MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WE KNOW THAT WE CANNOT RETURN TO WORK AND A VIBRANT ECONOMY WITH OUT. SAFE CHILD CARE AND WITH OUT FULLY FUNDED OUR CHILD CARE. WE NEED TO OBJECT TO A 10% CUT. IF CHILD CARE WORKERS CAN NOT COUNT ON INCOME THAT COMES IN AND IS STEADFAST WAY THEY WERE CLOSE AND OUR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY MOTHERS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET BACK TO WORK WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK IT IS ESSENTIAL. TO GETTING CALIFORNIA MOVING AAIN TO INVEST IN CHILD CARE THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU I'M GONNA GO TO. THIS POWER CARE BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO SWITCH WITH MR MULLIN. AND THEN- MISTER GIBSON THEN- DOCTOR JEWELRY AND THEN MISS MR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO GIVE VOICE TO THE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. WHO NEED VOICE TODAY TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUDGET PRIORITIZE THEM AS IT SHOULD. IT IS OFTEN SAID AND IT'S BEEN SAID HERE TODAY THAT OUR BUDGET SHOULD BE A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES. AND IT SHOULD AND NOT IS WHAT I ASKED TODAY AND THIS COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AND THIS BODY THAT WE HOLD TRUE TO OUR VALUES AND FUND THE PROGRAMS FOR THOSE THAT NEED US MOST SO TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S WOMEN. AND CHILDREN. I AM SOBRE ABOUT THE FISCAL REALITIES WE FACE. UNDERSTANDING WE MUST MAKE HARD DECISIONS TO BALANCE THIS BUDGET. WE MUST DO SO ONE NOT MAKING THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS PAY THE MAJORITY OF THAT PRICE. CUTS TO OUR SENIORS OUR CHILDREN AND OUR WOMEN ARE DEVASTATING IN THE PROPOSED MAY REVIVE. IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A STATE. FIRST FOR THE WOMEN OF CALIFORNIA. AS CHAIRPERSON OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF EXAMINING THE ISSUES AROUND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. CALIFORNIA IS GRAPPLING WITH EPIDEMIC LEVELS OF STI. IN EXPERTS EXPECT THE RECENT THOSE RATE OF THOSE FDIC INCREASE. AS THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ITS AFTERMATH CONTINUE. PLAN HEARD HEALTH CENTERS ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST IN SAFETY NET PROVIDERS ARE RACING FOR AN INCREASE IN UNINSURED PATIENTS. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO CUT FUNDING FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. IN THE MIDDLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX IS THE BACKBONE OF MANY REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHO'VE ALREADY BEEN FACED WITH A RASH OF ATTACKS FROM ANTI ABORTION LAWMAKERS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE MUST BE A PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET. AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS HEALTH CARE. THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS ARE ON THE LINE. AND LET ME BE CLEAR A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CUT TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. IS A ONE BILLION DOLLAR LOSS IN HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES CURRENTLY RECEIVING ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING OF NINE TO ONE TO ENCOURAGE ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES THIS IS THE HIGHEST FEDERAL MATCHING. RATE OF ANY TYPE OF SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA IF THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE MAY REVISED IS ADOPTED PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WOULD LOSE THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS. WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED THROUGH THE END OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS MEANS ALL THE WE MAY SAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BY CUTTING THE SERVICES. WE LOSE ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE CARE FOR FAMILY PACKED AND MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THAT IS NOT SMART FISCAL DECISION MAKING PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF PATIENTS WILL SEE INCREASED WAIT TIMES SERVICES AND FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS WILL BE CUT INCLUDING SEX EDUCATION CLINIC ESCORTS IN HEALTH CENTERS WILL CLOSE.WITH OUR TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS LOSE ACCESS TO CARE LIFESAVING SERVICES LIKE CANCER SCREENINGS AND WELLNESS VISITS WILL KNOW LEARN LONGER BE ACCESSIBLE IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THAT NEED IT MOST. A CALIFORNIA REACHES HISTORIC LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT IT IS ANTICIPATED THE TWO POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIA WORKERS INDEPENDENCE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING EMPLOYER BASED HEALTH CARE. THOSE PATIENTS WILL LIKELY TURN TO THE SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS ARE THE BACKBONE OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO KEEP DOORS OPEN AND PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE SO I WANNA KNOW HAVE THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS DIDN'T COUNTED WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE CUTS WERE MAKING ARE WE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS. I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. I AM THE MOTHER OF THREE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IN ONE OF THE LOWEST FUNDED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THIS STATE THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO CUT EXCEPT THE QUALITY OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. THE 10% ACROSS THE BOARD CUTS TO SCHOOLS IS THE LARGEST CUT WITH KIND IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IT'S MORE THAN 25% OF THE CUTS WE ARE MAKING. WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT OUR VALUES OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE AND THEY DESERVE OUR INVESTMENT NOT OUR LEFTOVERS. MY DISTRICT HAS CUT EVERYTHING THERE IS TO CAST AND IT WILL BE STUDENT SERVICES THE TAKE THIS HEAD. PLEASE MEMBERS. LET US NOT MAKE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN PAY THE PRICE. BUT YOU'RE GONNA GO MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS WANTED DID- WHAT A LOT OF HER THUS FAR. WANT TO BRING UP THREE VERY IMPORTANT POINTS ONLY THREE. ONE MAR THE KING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTIES IN ADDRESSING THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS BUT I RISE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVIVED A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ELIMINATE. SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING I SAID ELIMINATE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TOMORROW THE KING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL MURDER THE KING HOSPITAL OFFERS A HIGH QUALITY CARE TO ONE OF THE MOST. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA SOUTH LOS ANGELES SAVINGS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REPRESENTS SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO ITS GENERAL FUND. LOSING AN UPWARDS OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR WITH SIMILAR LOSSES EACH YEAR. LONG TERM ABSENCE OF THIS FUNDING THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL STRUCTURE WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED WITH THREATEN THE VERY VOLATILITY OF THIS HOSPITAL. IT WILL REQUIRE CUTS THAT WAS SEVERELY REDUCE THE SCOPE OF CARE PARTICULARLY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM DEPARTMENT MOST CERTAINLY LEADS TO PREVENTABLE LOSS OF LIFE. IN MY DISTRICT. THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME TO REDUCE BURNS FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHO MORTALITY RATE FOR COVERT NINETEEN IS PREDICTED TO BE FOUR TIMES THE FOUR TIMES THAT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES. MY SECOND POINT WORKFORCE INVESTMENT MY DISTRICT IS COMPRISED OF SOME OF THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I STAND HERE TODAY TO FIGHT ON THE BARE ON THEIR BEHALF WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IS SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS. WERE CUT BY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUDGET. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE INCOME SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT FIND JOBS IN THE REGULAR LABOR MARKET PARTICULARLY DOING APPEARED OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LIKE NOW WE'VE ALREADY INDICATED FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW ON. WE SHOULD LOOK FOR WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT NOT TO CHIP AWAY AT IT. WHY ARE WE MAKING CUTS TO RESOURCES THAT PREPARE THE CRITICAL WORK FORCE BECAUSE WE ARE ALL. WE ALL KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WILL BE HURT THOSE ARE OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND IT WILL RESULT IN HOMELESSNESS IN THIS STATE IT IS OUR SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. I WILL KEEP ON FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THE JOB IS IN THE FOREFRONT AND SO HE PEOPLE CAN PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE IS IN OUR CHILDREN'S BACKS AND A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD MY THIRD. CALL THE CLUBS NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE GIMLI CONTROL FUNDS MONIES THAT CARD ROOMS WERE OVER CHARGED WITH ALLOCATED SOMEWHERE ELSE TO ADDRESS PUBLIC. FASTER BUT THIS WERE HAVE THIS INTO THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EMPLOYING THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IT WAS THIRTY SECONDS. IT WAS THE SPECIAL BOND THAT OF THE CAR ROOM CLUBS HAVE CREATED AND THEY PAY INTO IT WOULD NOT HAVE IMPACTED THE CALIFORNIA. ECONOMY OR THE GENERAL FUND THESE CAR RULES ALLOW THE CONTINUES PAYMENTS OF EMPLOYEES CRITICAL FUNDS TO THOSE EMPLOYEES. MORE OVER FURTHERMORE SKEWS ME I WANT TO APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM GRAY AND OTHERS WHO HAVE SEIZE THE MOMENT OF DIFFICULTIES TO CREATE A SOLUTION TO CREATE REVENUE FOR OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE ALL HAVE THE COMMUNITIES IN OUR DISTRICT WHO ARE THE WHO ARE ON THE BRINK OF ECONOMIC DISASTER THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THESE SOLUTIONS MY CITY OF THE CITY OF COMPTON. WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO WRAP UP PLEASE MAKE YES WILL BE THE FIRST OF ALL THAT LIST I SUPPORT- VOTERS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON SPORTS WAIT WHAT. PORTS WEIGHTS OF BETTING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BRING NEW REVENUE MEMBERS THIS.

UP TO CHOI MISTER STONE MISS SMITH AND THEN THIS TO HOLD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TEN AND- THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE SO- ARE. EMBRACING THE DIFFICULT A PANDEMIC TIME. MEMBERS IT IS SO OVERWHELMING AND AT THE SAME TIME TROUBLING. OUT TO HEAR THE PROPOSED A BUDGET UP BY I WILL GOVERNOR. AS OUR LA- AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE UP GOING OUT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OUR AREAS SO OF COURSE THE BUDGET. THAT THE REYES US YOUR YES OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ROLE IN FUTURE FINANCIAL. POSITIONS THERE IS A UNIQUE TO AND THE SENSITIVE TIME WHERE ARE WE- THE LEGISLATIVE BODY- WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR WHAT THE STATE DOES WHAT DOES NOT DO IN DISPENSING OF THE OP BUDGET AND THE STATE'S SO RESOLUTIONS WHAT DOES STATE SO RESOURCES SO. IN THAT TIME IN OUR UNIQUE- CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A ANSWER FOR HOW WE ADDRESS TO THIS A HISTORIC BUDGET THE CHALLENGES. I URGE ALL COLLEAGUES TO WORK OF VIGOROUSLY VIGOROUSLY TO ENSURE A TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE WORK IN THE BI PARTISAN EFFORT TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES. YOUR THANK YOU WILL GO TO MISTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- MEMBERS KEEP YOUR SPEECHES WARM WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE ACTUALLY VOTE ON THIS THING. THIS IS A DIFFICULT BUDGET AND DIFFICULT TIMES AND ACTUALLY WHAT BETTER TIME THAN A CRISIS LIKE THIS THAN TO HAVE A FEMINIST BUDGET. BUDGET FOCUSED ON FAMILIES AND OUR MOST VULNERABLE THAT. THAT'S GREAT SO TO THE SUB FIVE CHAIR IN THE ADMINISTRATION. REALIGNING DEPARTMENT JUVENILE JUSTICE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THANK YOU THAT IS A GOOD PROPOSAL THE DEVIL WILL BE IN THE DETAILS AND HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED CLOSING PRESENCE AGAIN SO FIVE IS BEEN ASKING ABOUT FOR AWHILE SO APPRECIATE SEEING THAT LET'S LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON THAT AS WELL. TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SUB ONE CHAIR. COUNTIES RIGHT NOW OR IN THE MIDDLE OF IMPLEMENTING THE CONTINUING CARE REFORM. AND THERE ARE VULNERABLE TIME. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST REALLY RAMPING UP INVESTMENTS IN THE RESOURCE FAMILY NETWORKS THE FOSTER FAMILY RESOURCE FAMILY RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT. AND IF WE LOOK AT WHAT ANECDOTALLY SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT SYSTEM WE'LL SEE MORE INPUT BECAUSE OF THE STRESS IS BEING PUT ON FAMILIES NOW. SO I AM HOPING THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONTINUING THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THAT SYSTEM GOD FORBID WE NEED IT BUT WE PROBABLY WILL NEED IT AND IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. KEEPING KIDS AT HOME OR GIVING THEM SERVICES THAT THEY NEED PRECLUDES. YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AND IF WE CAN ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS WE PRECLUDE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ADULT HOMELESS THAT ARE OUT THERE. SO THESE ARE HONESTLY INVESTMENTS WE CAN AD SHOULD BE MAKING NOW. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SHORT CHANGING THOSE EFFORTS IN THIS BROADER SENSE OVER THIS BROADER NEED OF MANAGING THE BUDGET WHICH IS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT TASK AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION. TAKING THAT DEEP DIVE BUT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT IT WE BEMOAN. THE CUTS. AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE EXPENSE SIDE BUT AS ANY. ORGANIZATIONS GOING TO DO WHEN YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THE EXPENSE SIE WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE REVENUE SIDE. AS WELL AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND AND WORK TOGETHER TO FIND. BETTER SOURCES OF REVENUE WE HAVE TO REACH THANK THE REVENUES IN THE TAXATION SYSTEM MULTIMILLION CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE ARE VULNERABLE TO THESE KIND OF CHANGE AS- THESE UPS AND DOWNS DONE A GOOD. SALTING THEM AWAY. BUT WE'RE GONNA BURN THROUGH THAT VERY QUICKLY WE HAVE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT JUST EXPENSE PROBLEMS BUT THERE REVENUE PROBLEMS AND I THINK WE HAVE TO ADMIT TO. MAY THAT IT BETTER WILL. WE'RE GONNA MISS MRS A BY PASS IN HER TIME WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MR HOLDEN. FOR C. WORKING HIS WAY BACK AN THEN MISTER NAZARIAN IN THE MIDST BURKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MR VICE CHAIR. AND MEMBERS AS A MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION I RISE TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION. PART OF THIS RECESSION CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WERE ALREADY UNDER FUNDED. AND IN MY DISTRICT SCHOOLS WERE ALREADY CLOSING TO SAVE MONEY. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSES A 10% CUT AND LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THIS WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS HAS PUSHED FOR REFORM TO THE LCL F. THAT EXPANDS FUNDING FOR MORE STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP. WE BELIEVE THIS WOULD FUND THE LITERAL GAP IN L. CFL AND GO A LONG WAY IN ADDRESSING DISPARITIES IN EDUCATION FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. BUT INSTEAD OF MOVING FORWARD WE'RE NOW STEPPING BACKWARDS. WITH BIG CUTS. A 10% CUT TO L. CFF EQUATES TO THE FRONT FOLLOWING CUTS. THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE A ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLAR DECREASED PER STUDENT SPENDING. EIGHT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN DOLLAR FUNDING CUT. PASSWORD IN A NINETEEN POINT 1% INCREASE IN CLASS SIZE. I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS MUST BE MADE WITH THESE PROPOSED CUTS WOULD STRIP DISTRICTS OF THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO RE OPEN SAFELY. WHICH IS CRITICAL THE RECOVERY OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. HOWEVER I BELIEVE AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS WHICH IS WHY I WROTE AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAM. IT GIVES SCHOOLS THE ABILITY TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR VULNERABLE STUDENTS. BUT SCHOOLS NEED THE FUNDS TO BE CREATIVE AND PUSH PROGRAMS FOR. WHICH IS WHY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES. AND THE GOVERNOR TO ALSO BE INNOVATIVE INSURE OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE PRIORITIZE DURING THE TOUGH BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AHEAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH BY THE BACK TO MR MULLIN FOR A QUICK SECOND THOUGH I HAVE- NAZARIAN BURKE RAMOS AND DAVID CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE QUESTION IS FOR MR PROTECT. THEIR BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS AROUND- ECONOMIC RECOVERY. ROACHES OBVIOUSLY WE'RE DEALING WITH BUDGETS AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS WERE TO MAKE BUT IN TERMS OF RECOVERING. FROM WHAT THE ECONOMY. IS CONFRONTING RIGHT NOW WE TALK ABOUT SOME BONDS A JOBS BOND CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND WHICH COULD HAVE SOME JOB CREATING A FAX THERE'S ALSO A DISCUSSION AROUND. A SECURE TIES SAYING. A SPECIAL FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE TO- ESSENTIALLY GET MONEY OUT ON THE STREET AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO HAVE SOME STIMULATIVE A FAX- JUST GIVEN WHERE WE ARE WITH INTEREST RATES AND SO FORTH ARE THERE PREFERRED APPROACH IS ON FROM THE ALLEY- STANDPOINT ON HOW WE MIGHT GO ABOUT THIS OR IT WILL BE. TENSION WE SOMETHING UP A MIX UP TALK ABOUT A- IN THE THIS OF THE SAME KIND OF A CONVERT. I'M A CO. I THINK IS WILLING TO PUT MISTER MALONE I CAN OFFER A COUPLE OF INITIAL THOUGHTS AND PERHAPS MY COLLEAGUES BACK IN THE OFFICE COULD WEIGH IN AS WELL- IN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE LOW YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS THAT IS A GOOD TIME TO BORROW FOR PROJECTS THE ONE THING WE WOULD JUST MENTIONED I BELIEVE IS THAT. LOT OF TIMES THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL LEAD TIME FROM THE POINT WHEN YOU DECIDE YOU WOULD WANT TO GO DOWN THAT PATH TO GETTING THE VOTER APPROVAL NECESSARY TO GET TO RANGING THE FINANCING IDENTIFYING PROJECT BY THE TIME YOU GET THE MONEY OUT YEAH HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE STARTING A ECONOMIC EVERY TAP SO. THE CHALLENGE AT THE TIME I MEAN IF IT. IT SO I DON'T KNOW IF MY ARE AVAIL IN THE U. I. YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE AVAILABLE I THINK THEY COME ON THE SCREEN WHEN THEY START TALKING. SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD. CAN YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES SOME FOR CAROLINE GO AHEAD CHARACTER HOWEVER. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I JUST A FEW POINTS WHICH ACTUALLY OCCURRED ADD TO WHAT MISTER PECK SAID AS YOU KNOW WITH THE STATE ALSO FACES A CHALLENGE IN THE FACT THAT IT CAN'T IT CAN'T DEFICIT SPEND. THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THE STATE- CAN SERVE INDIRECTLY DO THIS THAT WE THAT WE RAISE OF AN OFFICE INCLUDING- EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE THINKING ABOUT OPTIONS RELATED TO THE- IT DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM BUT WE ARE CONSTRAINED- PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY WE COULD GET THE MONEY OUT WHERE WE GO DOWN THE BOND FINANCING. AS IT RELATES OF APPROVAL- BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN HELP ARE YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT MAKES OF SOLUTIONS YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO AND IF THEY'RE PARTICULARLY- ITEMS THAT YOU- AS A BODY DECIDE TO PURSUE WE CERTAINLY CAN HELP YOU ARE. ON THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I'M WORKING THROUGH THE TRIP. UP FOR THOSE ITEMS. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. BURKE WE ARE GOING TO GO TO THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE MISSION IS VERY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FIRST OF ALL OF FOR ALL THE WONDERFUL POINTS THAT WERE MADE AND GIVING VOICE TO ALL THE VOICELESS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHETHER IT'S- OUR YOUTH AND FOSTER CARE OR- OUR NEIGHBORS ARE UNDOCUMENTED- NEIGHBORS I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MISS PARKER FOR BEING HERE WITH US I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS BEING FIRST STEP AND- SERIES OF THE LOGS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING. IN ORDER TO GET TO A THE OF THAT UNDER THE WORST CIRCUMSTANCES CAN CAN HAVE SOME- PRESERVES BENEFITS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST DECADE. THE LOS ANGELES DELEGATION. WHICH ALSO THE- SUFFERS FROM THE IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN. AS WELL AS THE OTHER EPIDEMIC THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH UP UNTIL COVERT NINETEEN STRUCK OUR HOMELESSNESS ISSUE. THAT HAS ALSO BEEN DISPROPORTIONATE AND LOS ANGELES. I WANTED TO FOCUS AS CHAIR OF AGING COMMITTEE ON- ON THE IMPACTS OF- WHAT IT WHAT THIS BUDGET IS DOING TO OUR SENIORS AND ARE FRAIL. TING COMMUNITY. UP FIRST POINT AT WHEN WE ALL SHARE CONCERNS FOR SENIORS BECAUSE OF CORBETT AND CAN RATES. AND THAT'S ARE WE CONSIDERING. PROGRAM THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR SENIORS WERE CERTIFIED ELIGIBLE FOR SKILLED NURSING. BUT LOOK AT HOME. THIS PROGRAMS THE CIVIC. PROGRAMS THAT SEND THE CENTER BASED ADULTS OR PREFER A BILL TO THE USER AND THEIR FAMILIES AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE ELIMINATING THESE PROGRAMS SIMPLY MEANS TRANSFERRING THE POPULATION TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THERE WILL NOT ONLY BE GREATER UNCERTAINTY FOR PATIENTS BUT INCREASED MORBIDITY. ESTACION PUT OUT A STATEMENT. THAT A PROGRAM CALLED SKILLED NURSING AT HOME WILL BE IN PLACE SOMETIME IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS IS THIS WAS AS OF- FOUR O'CLOCK FOUR PM LAST FRIDAY. THIS WAS A STATEMENT WITH NO DETAILS AND COMMITTEE DATE DON'T MISS THE ELIMINATION OF THE STAFFS AND ASSIST. PLEASE IT HOW THE- OVERALL BUT THIS IS AN OVERALL BUDGET SAVINGS AND IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M JUST GOING TO GO THROUGH MY POINTS. AND SO FAR THERE'S BEEN TWO QUESTIONS- NEXT IS A SENIOR NEXT AREA IS THE SENIOR NUTRITION WHAT WE COMMONLY KNOW AS MEALS ON WHEELS AND OTHER CONGREGATE NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE BEING CUT BY NEARLY HALF. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOUR SEATER MEET DELIVERY AND THE AREA IN SEASON AGING HAVE MET THE INCREASEDNEED. HOW ARE WE CONSIDER HEADING BASS LINE THING TO A PROGRAM THAT HAS HAD AN OVERWHELMING INCREASED BY HALF. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE INCREASING FUNDING TO OTHER NUTRITION PROGRAMS LIKE FOOD BANKS THAT MOST SENIORS IN MILK YOU CAN ACCESS. THE KOBE GUIDELINES HAVE THEM SHELTERING WELL BEYOND OTHERS. FOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST BASIC AS WE HAVE HOW CAN WE EXPECT OUR AGENCY I'M SORRY BUT CUT THIS MAGNITUDE AND STILL NEED THE BASE NEEDS US HERE'S- WHAT NOT LEAST. SERVICE CENTER. PROVIDES IS AT REST PAGE FOR THE- THIS REMOVES KERN AND BUDGET. AND TAKES THEM TO LINE THEY SEEN THE RECESSION DURING THIS DURING FROM SINCE THE LAST GREATRECESSION DURING THIS PANDEMIC FAMILY CARE GIVERS ARE ALREADY SEEN LIMITED SERVICES FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AND ARE HAVING TO FILL NEEDS THAT MANY RELY ON THE TRAINING THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER PROVIDE AGAIN THEY PROVIDE SERVICES TRAININGS AND RESPITE TO UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS CUTTING FUNDING WILL LIKELY CAUSE AN INCREASE OF SENIORS GOING INTO SKILLED NURSING OR LEAVING THEM IN UNSAFE SITUATIONS. COLLEAGUES LET'S NOT FORGET% THESE CUTS ARE BEING PROPOSED AT A TIME WHEN WE NO OUR AGING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE INCREASING FROM WHAT IT CURRENTLY 12% IS THE RELATION TO TWENTY FIVE OF THE STATE'S POP. WITH THE NEXT FIFTEEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA NAGA MISS BURKE THING WE HAVE RAMOS DAVID CHIU. AND MR DAILY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AS A FAMILY THAT WAS STRUCK WITH COVERT NINETEEN WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY THIS VIRUS CAN BRING. WE STRUGGLE TO FIND TASKS AND I HAD TO TELL MY DAUGHTER THAT THE VIRUS THAT ENDED HER SCHOOL YEAR. THAT WAS KEEPING US HOME. THAT STOP THE WORLD IN ITS TRACKS WAS NOW PART OF OUR LIVES. THE HARDEST PART OF THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS. WAS THAT I COULDN'T PROMISE MY DAUGHTER BETTER DAD WOULD BE OKAY. BUT I CAN'T PROMISE WAS THAT NO MATTER WHAT. I WOULD LOVE HER I WOULD TAKE CARE OF HER TO THE BACK OF MY EXPERIENCE KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY. IT'S ALSO A PROMISE THAT I NEED TO EVERY CALIFORNIA CHILD THE DAD WAS SWORN IN. IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT PROMISE I RIE TO SPEAK TODAY. OUR STATE HOME RESTRICTIONS HAVE NECESSARILY BUT ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRAINED OUR SUPPLY DEMAND IS STILL THERE. THOSE WHO CAN STILL ONE OF BY YOU CAN SEE IN IN THE LINES AT THE GROCERY STORES AND THE THOUSANDS OF DELIVERY TRUCKS RUNNING AROUND OUR CITIES. PEOPLE WANT TO BUY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE BUSINESSES CAN RESPOND TO THAT DEMAND BY BEING ABLE TO AMONG OTHER THINGS FIND TRAINED AND QUALIFIED. EMPLOYEES VERY AND ROBIN ON. THIS RECESSION HAS FALLEN HARDEST ON THOSE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. THESE WORKERS ARE RELYING ON A SOCIAL SAFETY NET IN ORDER TO WEATHER THIS STORM. OUR SISTER DIRECTED TO SEE CASES INCREASED TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ABOUT A 100% INCREASE. PEOPLE OF COLOR. THESE NUMBERS DEEPLY DOES THIS FOR THE NEED TO CREATE OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA DEPENDS AS WE NAVIGATE UNCHARTERED WATERS. I AM HOWEVER ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S DECISION TO CONTINUE FLEXIBLE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND CAL WORK TO CHANGE THAT I PROPOSED TO MAKE PERMANENT AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY SEVEN. HOWEVER I AM DISHEARTENED BY THE NEARLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CUT TO EXPANDED SUBSIDIZE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS WITHIN CAO WORKS. WE MADE SIMILAR CUTS IN OUR LAST RECESSION A GREATLY DETERIORATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THOSE PROGRAMS. IN MY DISTRICT THE SOUTH BAY WITH NOTES THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE INTEREST DRASTIC REDUCTION IN PARTICIPATION IN THEIR PROGRAMS FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES TWO FIVE HUNDRED. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ABLE TO TEACH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN OUR CENTRAL WORKFORCE THEY SHOULD BE COUPLED WITH POLICE TO TRANSITION FROM HIGH THE PHYSICAL EXPOSURE JOBS TO WORK AT HOME. URGE THE GOVERNOR TO RETAIN. THE PLASTIC TO WORK FOR TO PROGRAMS THAT CAN BOLSTER OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IF WE CANNOT PROMISE OUR CONSTITUENTS A JOB RIGHT NOW THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO TRAINING. SO THAT WHEN THE TIME COMES A LIVING WAGE IT'S NO LONGER A DREAM. BUT A REALITY. AS CHAIR REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE I'M FULLY AWARE OF THE FISCAL CHALLENGES WE FACE OUR GENERAL FUND. REVENUES RELIES HEAVILY ON PERSONAL INCOME TAX. WITHOUT SAFEGUARDING INSISTING JOBS AND CREATING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKERS TO EARN A LIVING WAGE WE MAKE THE CHOICE TO LIMóN OUR ECONOMIC POTENTIAL. I AM RECOVERY. ONE THING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT CALLED FOR AN INCREASE IN TAX RATE WE ARE STILL BEING ASKED TO LIMIT TO THE DEGREE. COMPANIES CAN USE PREVIOUSLY ON TAX CREDIT. THESE ARE COMPANIES ENGAGING IN SOCIAL WEEK USEFUL BEHAVIOR. LIKE UNION WORK ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS BUILDING HOMES FOR THE POOR AND RESEARCHING NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IF WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO HONOR THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THE SHORT TERM. WE SHOULD AT THE VERY LEAST BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN LIFT OTHER BURDENS ON THE VERY BUSINESSES WE WILL NEED. TO CARRY OUT INTO A MORE HOPEFUL FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT INCLUDING THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. STUDENTS IN MY DISTRICT LACK THE DEVICES AND CONNECTIVE ITTY TO ENGAGE A REMOTE LEARNING SEVERELY JEOPARDIZING THEIR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. AND HIGHLIGHTING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT EXISTS IN LOW INCOME URBAN AREAS. I WOULD BE REMISS ALSO IF I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE GREAT OBSTACLES FACING THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. HOUSING IN SECURITY. WE CANNOT FULLY RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC PHYSICALLY OR ECONOMICALLY INTO EVERY FAMILY AND CHILD HAS THIRTY SECONDS. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE ARE AWARE OF HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM BEING HOMELESS. WORKING TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION INCLUDING PREVENTION EMERGENCY SHELTER AND PERMIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS IMPERATIVE. I WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THANK YOU TO THE SPEAKER FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY. I LIKE MY COLLEAGUES BELIEVE WILL BEING ELECTED TO OFFICE IS A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. I VALUE THE WORKING INSIDE OF THE LA IN THEIR CORRECT. THE LEGISLATURE MUST GUARD ITS AUTHORITY. I BELIEVE IN THIS BODY. THE VERY PEOPLE LIKE TO IT. AND THE PEOPLE THAT FAITH BASED PLACE THEIR FAITH IN US AND I BELIEVE OUR BUDGET AND IT'S PROCESS SHOULD. PROTECT THOSE VALUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ROSS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- MISTER SPEAKER FOR HOLDING THIS- HISTORIC EVENT HERE TODAY AND ALLOWING US TO SPEAK ON ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO US CERTAINLY MENTAL ILLNESS IS AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY MOVING FORWARD MENTAL HEALTH HAS TO BE PART OF THAT EQUATION TO MOVE FORWARD A VIBRANT AND HEALTHY ECONOMY AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT WERE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT ARE HOMELESS OUTH THAT ARE OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS SUICIDE SUICIDE IN OUR YOUTH POPULATION CONTINUES TO RISE IN BECOMES COULD BECOME THAT EPIDEMIC THAT WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT SO FUNDING STREAMS SHOULD BE INTACT FOR THOSE AREAS MOVING FORWARD WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR SENIOR POPULATION WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE START TO LOOK AT THE CUTS ARE SENIORS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE CUTS WITHIN THIS BUDGET. WE START TO LOOK AT THOSE AREAS AND MAKE SURE THEY WERE ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF ALL THAT ARE OUT THERE AS WELL AS OUR VETERANS WE TO CELEBRATE MEMORIAL DAY AND JUST CHAIR AND TO TALK ABOUT THE VETERANS HOME IN BARSTOW TALKING ABOUT CLOSING THE VETERANS HOME IN BARSTOW IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T TOLERATE DECEMBER DINO COUNTY WE NEED TO SPEAK UP FOR OUR VETERANS ESPECIALLY ONE OF THE FEW STATE VETERAN HOMES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO KNOW THAT FIRES OR SOMETHING THAT WE FACE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING. THEY'RE GONNA BE CUMMINGS FIRE SEASON AROUND THE CORNER. AND WE START TO TALK ABOUT A 10% CUT. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING ON THE BACK OF PUBLIC SAFETY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OF FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THAT DURING THOSE TIMES OF CRISIS WE CALL UPON. THIS MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PART OF THE- DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD.AND I ALSO URGE THIS BODY. ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE BODIES. IN OUR NATION. THEN WE MAKE PROMISES ESPECIALLY TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. ON TRIBAL DIVERSION PROGRAMS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE INDIAN HERITAGE CENTER. THAT CURRENTLY SITS ON CENTER FOR PROPERTY. A DIS UP DISPLAYS TO THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE BY PUTTING A CENTER. IN A SUTTER FOR. WE WERE ABLE TO GET THROUGH FUNDING PRIOR FINDING. AN AREA. FOR INDIAN HERITAGE CENTER TO MOVE FORWARD AND TO SEE THAT AS SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE CUT IN THE BUDGET. IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T TOLERATE. LET'S MAKE SURE. THAT WHEN FUNDING PROMISES ARE MADE THAT WE KEEP THOSE PROMISES THAT ARE THERE. WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE HAVE MET WITH THE GOVERNOR. OF WITH THE LATINO CAUCUS THERE WE TALK ABOUT THE FARMWORKERS AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE OUT THERE PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR US. THAT WE MAKE SURE WE HONOR THEM WITH THEIR I. TEN AREAS THAT ARE THERE SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY COME THROUGH AND BE ABLE TO FILE FOR THOSE THINGS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE SSUES THAT MAKES OUR ECONOMY MOVE FORWARD. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT THEN WE SEEN IN THE PRESENTATIONS AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THERE I'M BUDGET SOLUTIONS IS SUPPORTING JOB CREATION. THAT WE START TO LOOK AT BUSINESSES SO WE DRIVING IN THAT REVENUE INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT MIGHT BE. TALKED ABOUT LATER IN THE FUTURE BUT IF WE COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THOSE SOLUTIONS ON THE REVENUE STREAMS THAT ARE COMING IN ESPECIALLY TO SMALL BUSINESS. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. ALL BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE DEDICATING TO. AND THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HERE AT THE STATE- BUT ALSO IN THE LOCAL. AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AB I'VE I'VE- FOUNDATIONS AS WELL- AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FILL IN THE GAPS WHERE THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM- DID LEFT A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES OUT ESPECIALLY IN ARE UNDER REPRESENTED. COMMUNITIES I'M SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THE OTHER THING IS THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX- THAT IS THE FIRST THE FIRST YEAR OF THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAXES EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX. SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY HAS BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS- WE PROPOSE THE TO MAINTAIN THAT PROPOSAL FROM JANUARY WHICH IS TO WAIVE. THAT TAX IN THE FIRST YEAR BUSINESS SO FOR A NEW START BUSINESSES THEY WOULD HAVE. LESS OF A BARRIER I'M TO CROSS IN IN CREATING THEIR BUSINESS SO THOSE ARE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BUT I DO WANT TO LEAVE- THIS BODY WITH THE AND THAT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH THERE'S MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO CREATE JOBS I THINK I'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED TO SUBSIDIZE EMPLOYMENT THOSE ARE ALL THINGS. THAT CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IN A SPECIALLY MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SKILLS ARE MATCHED UP. WITH THE EMPLOYMENT- THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE AND IN THE FUTURE- SO THOSE ARE THINGS WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU ALL. ON I'M OVER THE COMING WEEKS. THANK YOU THERE ANY OTHER-SOLUTION I KNOW THERE WAS ANOTHER IF YOU IF YOU COULD JUST. MAKE ONE MOST OF THEM ARE GOING TO GET NEXT HI THIS FROM. THANK YOU. AND I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS- STAND HERE SPEAK ESPECIALLY ON THE FUNDING THAT WAS PROMISED. TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LET'S MAKE SURE WE HOLD THOSE PROMISES TRUE BECAUSE THERE'S NEVER BEEN. ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN- TOLD ONE THING AND TAKING THINGS AWAY FROM THEM. RIGHT THANK YOU CAN I THINK I JUST WANT TO SPEAK ON THAT ONE HE'S BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT WAS GENERAL FUND AND THAT. THAT'S NOW BEEN SHIFTED TO LEASE REVENUE BONDS- SO THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A CUT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT FINANCING. OF THE OF THE FACILITY SO ONCE THERE'S A PROJECT AT THAT WE- CAN PUT TOGETHER THEN THERE WOULD BE BONDS ISSUED TO PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE WILL WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT MESSAGE OUT FOR THE RIGHT PEOPLE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER DAVID CHIU- THEN MR DAILY IF YOU STILL HERE IF NOT THE MR GABRIEL. AND THEN MR BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LET ME FIRST START BY- BY THANKING THE GOVERNOR AND ADMINISTRATION- WITH REGARD TO THIS BUDGET- WE ALL KNOW HOW INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING THIS IS AS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE MY COMMENTS WILL BE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON HOUSING. DURING OUR STATE'S HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THE WORDS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS ABLE TO AVOID MAJOR CUTS IN THIS AREA- FROM HIS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BUDGET. BUT ON HOUSE CALIFORNIANS NEED MORE RESOURCES. CORONAVIRUS ON TOP OF THESE CRISES IS GASOLINE ON FIRE BECAUSE HOUSING AS HEALTH CARE AND THE LACK OF HOUSING WILL INCREASE COVER NINETEEN SPREAD. WE NEED MORE FUNDING TO PERSONALLY HOUSE CALIFORNIANS OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO STABILIZE RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS. WHO ARE A WRENCH OR A MORTGAGE CHECK AWAY FROM ADDICTIONS OR FORECLOSURES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONSIDER ONGOING REVENUE MEASURES TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION. IN BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOUR I ASKED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND SOME SPECIFICALLY PROPOSED POLICIES AND WOULD STILL APPRECIATE ANSWERS TO THEM. FIRST PROJECT ROOM KEY TO PURCHASE HOTELS AND MOTELS FOR HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS IS A GOOD CONCEPT. BUT THERE ARE MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE. BOTH BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE PER UNIT AND ALSO BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FUND THE SERVICES NEEDED FOR EFFECTIVE PERMITS SUPPORT OF HOUSING. MY QUESTION IS WHETHER WE CAN MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE FLEXIBLE TO ALSO CONSIDER RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO MASTER LEASES FROM PRIVATE LANDLORDS. PAYING FOR RENT AS A LUMP SUM BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR WITH OPERATING ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. COULD BE CONSIDER SPENDING ON REAL PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH WOULD BE A TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT PER UNIT VERSES THE ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR COST. TO PURCHASE AND REHAB A HOTEL OR MOTEL UNIT. SECOND I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FROM AND MAINTAINING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT LIKE TECH. A MUCH NEEDED TO OUR CHAMPION FOR YEARS. THAT BEING SAID THE PROPOSED CAP ON INVESTORS USING TAX CREDITS WOULD UNDERMINE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS. THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS ALREADY DECREASING INVESTOR INTEREST IN THESE CREDITS PUTTING PROJECT FINANCING IN JEOPARDY. I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR CONSIDERATION OF CHANGING THAT CAP OR EXEMPTING LIE TECH. BE ON HOUSING I WANT TO JOIN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE COLLEAGUES IN PUSHING FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND HEALTH CARE EDUCATION CHILD CARE FAMILY LEAVE AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO STABILIZE OUR SAFETY NET. I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE PROPOSAL EMANATION OF ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTERS. AND MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICE PROGRAMS. TO NOT UNDERMINE PAST DECISIONS ON PROP FIFTY SIX FOR A HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTERS. TO STABILIZE THE PLIGHT OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND WORKERS WHO BECAUSE OF THEIR STATUS CAN'T ACCESS FEDERAL SUPPORT OR MUCH SUPPORT AT ALL. TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES THE REFLECT THE ECONOMIC VITALITY AND DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. AND ALSO TO ADDRESS THE RISE IN HATE INCIDENTS AGAINST ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS AND OTHERS- HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS- NOT NECESSARILY TODAY I WOULD IMAGINE BUT- IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THAT TO LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH EVERYONE. TO WHAT MOVING FORWARD THESE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. I'M IN A DRESS A COUPLE OF THEM ONE OF THEM THAT HAVE BEEN- AFTER A COUPLE TIMES AND THAT'S ABOUT THE MSF P. PROGRAM. AND THE SEA BASS PROGRAM- BOTH PROGRAMS THAT ARE ARE VERY GOOD PROGRAMS THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY- IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE STATE EVENLY. AND WE ARE LOOKING BECAUSE OF HOW VULNERABLE AND FREE OF THIS POPULATION IS AND HOW- IMPACTED BY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THEY ARE. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS NEW BENEFIT THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE MAIN MEDI CAL PROGRAM SO WOULD BE STATEWIDE IN WOULD BE CONSISTENT STATEWIDE- THAT WOULD BE PROVIDE. THE NURSING NURSING HOME AT AND NURSING CERTAIN NURSING HOME SERVICES AT HOME. AND THE IDEA WOULD BE TO WRAP AROUND THESE FRAIL SENIORS WITH THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT- AT HOME- TO BE HONEST LIKE THE COVERT BAND HAMMOCK HAS REALLY IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY THE OPERATION OF MANY OF THESE CENTERS BECAUSE- SENIORS CAN'T SAFELY CONGREGATE- IN. AND COMMON SPACES SO THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK I'M AT DAY IN AND DAY NIGHT TO GET THOSE- WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO THOSE SENIORS- ADDITIONAL MEALS TO THE SENIORS. AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE COMING IN JULY ONE- I BELIEVE THAT THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM- IT THAT'S BEEN REFERENCED A FEW TIMES WAS A ONE TIME REQUESTED THAT FROM LAST YEAR THAT HADN'T GONE OUT YET AND I THINK THAT'S- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- KEEPS BEING RIGHT UP IT'S NOT A BASE CUTS YOU SEEN YOUR NUTRITION PROGRAMS THAT. ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT BE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BUDGET. AND THERE IS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FINES THERE'S A LOT THAT'S GOING ON IN THE COPA NINETEEN RESPONSE TO GET ADDITIONAL MEALS TO SENIORS. AND ALSO HELP TO SUPPORT THAT THE RICH THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN VERY- HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. I'M SO SENIORS ARE A HIGH PRIORITY- I DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THOSE TWO OPTIONAL BENEFITS. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CHOICES THERE ARE REALLY HARD CHOICES WHEN YOU LOOK AT REDUCING THE GENERAL FUND AT THE LEVEL. THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET ABSENCE BETTER ABSENT FEDERAL FUNDS- THERE ARE REALLY JUST THREE SCHOOLS IN THE HEALTHCARE AREA THERE'S ELIGIBILITY THEIR OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND THEIR RATES. AND THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX ARE SUPPLEMENTAL RATES THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING JUST FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. PRIOR AT TO ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THOSE THOSE MONIES WERE BEING FUND FOR FINDING CAL BASED. AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO THROUGH THE BETTER ECONOMIC TIMES. TO SWITCH THOSE MONEY INTO SUPPLEMENTAL RAY. AND I'M NOT TO SIT HERE AND- THAT THE CARE AND THREE AND A BE FINE THROUGH THIS THERE IS ALL. OF AND- I THE ENTIRE CARE AND THE IMPACTS THAT THE KOBE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON IT AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE ON IT. IN TERMS OF THE A SURGE AND NEEDING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL HOSPITAL BEDS THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY- BUILDING UP ADDITIONAL SURGE CAPACITY SO THAT WE COULD AVOID SOME OF THE AWFUL THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD- WITH PAY. PATIENTS NOT HAVING ADEQUATE SPACES. IN IN HOSPITALS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS WE DON'T HAVE ALL AND A FULL GRASP OF ALL THE IMPACTS YET. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT- AS WE WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY IS. IT'S A SHARED FUNDING PART PARTNERSHIP ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A HUGE PART OF FUNDING OU HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM ON HOW TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PARTICIPATION AND FUNDING OUR OUR- OUR SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA- BUT I YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE RECOGNIZED. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. CONCERN AND IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE THIS YEAR BUT THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ESPECIALLY HOW THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC ARE GOING TO BE- WRAPPED INTO MANAGED CARE RATES. THERE ISN'T ANY MINUTE THINGS WE DON'T KNOW AS WE SIT HERE TODAY- AND I WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS FOR MANY YEARS. APPRECIATE THAT I. MICHAEL TURNS WERE HOUSING SO. I'D OF IF I COULD GET SO ADDRESSES ARE A I YEAH YOUR HOUSE QUESTIONS AS WELL YEAH SO. CAN USED TO BE A VERY HIGH PRICE. OF THE GOVERNOR AND FOR. WE HAD TO PULL BACK ON SOME OF THE- FUN. IT WAS RIPPED. ORDINARY OUR- GENERAL FUND. SCENE AND THAT WE'RE IN THE LAST. BUDGET BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAINTAIN THE ALREADY FOR THAT I'M TO THE- CREDIT BROWN THERE REALLY. PIECING TOGETHER. AT HOUSING ACROSS STATE THERE BARTON THAN EVER AND THE HOW ACTION IT USED I ARE TO BE A TO BE A PRICE FOR THE GOVERNOR WE WILL FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS BY AND THIS TO MEET I'M REFORMS BUT FORWARD I HAVE TO DO IN TERMS OF HOME. I THINK THE IDEA OF A THE HOME PROPOSAL AND SWITCH WITH REALLY TO USE THESE ONE BETTER UNDS TO TRY AND SOME OUT THAT CAN SUSTAINING A COULD HOLD COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE I'M HAVE MORE THIS FOR I OF IT AB GOING FOR AND SO THE THAT WAS REALLY THE IDEA OF ON YOU THESE WERE TIME FOR FUN TO TRYING MAKE THAT CONTINUE HAPPENED I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS CONTINUES TO BE MORE NEED FOR THOSE WRAPAROUND IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES. IT'S JUST GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE FISCAL SITUATION IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THE STATE TO COMMIT TO ADDITIONAL BE ON THE CORE PROGRAMS THAT THAT WE ALREADY FIND WHICH IS MEDI CAL CAL WORKS AS A SCIENTIST P. I HSS THOSE PROGRAMS REALLY NEEDED TO NEED TO BE MAINTAINED AS THE AS THE FOUNDATION OF SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. THANK YOU. THE MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN KEEPING US ALONG WITH OUR SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FOR YOUR HELPFUL- AND THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND ALSO TO THE MINISTRATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK THIS HEARING TODAY'S GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO THE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO A CHOICES AND DILEMMAS THAT YOU'RE FACING AND- YOUR THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE TO A LOT OF THIS- A LOT OF WHAT I WANTED TO SAY THIRTY BEEN SHARED BY MY COLLEAGUES I JUST WANNA. ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THAT. COMMENTS THAT HAVE MADE ABOUT FUNDING FOR A- FOR EDUCATION PARTICULARLY HIGHER EDUCATION FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR AN S. S. P. FOR UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY- ALSO WANTED TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE PARTICULARLY THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS OF OUR FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA ROSA WHO I THINK REALLY. HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT RESPECTS- WHAT I DID WANT TO DO IS JUST BRIEFLY SHARE TWO CONCERNS- BUT I THINK HAVING BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSED TODAY ONE. ONE ONE LARGER AND ONE ONE OF THE BIT MORE MODEST. AT THE FIRST ONE IS AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING WHICH IS A TOP PARTY FOR THE LA COUNTY DELEGATION SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE DELEGATION AS WELL. I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THEIR NIGHT MIGHT NOT BE- SUFFICIENT EMPHASIS AROUND THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IN OUR COUNTY IS THAT. AS MUCH WORK AS WE'VE DONE IN IN THE- LAST YEAR WE PUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE TO HOUSING YET HOMELESSNESS STILL ONE UP. 12% IN THE COUNTY. A DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS THAT- EVERY DAY ON AVERAGE FOR PUTTING A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PEOPLE INTO. HOUSING AND HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE ARE SLIPPING INTO. CYNICISM BUT THAT RATE WERE JUST DOING OUR CELL INTO A- DEEPER AND- INTO. HOLE OUT WE- KNOW. IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WERE. TO LOOK. AT CLOSE TO THIRTY FIVE. THOUSAND OF SUB. AFFORD HOUSING IS. SUBSIDIES IN THE RESTRICTIONS EXPIRE NOT AS- WHAT HAPPENED ACTUALLY CALLOUSED. CONSEQUENCES FOR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS SO. VERY INTERESTED TO UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION IS MENTION SOME OF THIS IN THE MAY REVISED BY. REALLY OFFICE. AROUND HELLO IT'S HOUSE KEY. THEM IN THEIR HOMES. IT'S A IT'S A REALLYPRUDENT INVESTMENT FOR TWENTY THOUSAND. YOU CAN PRISON. OF THE HOUSE. PLUS MORE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AND- THE UNIT IN IN PARTS OF AUSTIN. I'M ALSO ALL OF THE VûI. COST THE GOAL. WITH THIS ONCE PEOPLE FALLING HOMELESSNESS THE- HEALTH CARE NOW. HEALTH AND- JUSTICE. THAT IS. TO PAY PEOPLE OUT HOMELESSNESS. IS EXTRAORDINARY VERY IN. TO HEAR. FROM THE MISTER. ABOUT THE- ABOUT THE PRESS. AND EVER ARE AND PREVENTION OF HOME. IN THIS. THERE THE OTHER IS A IS A MORE MODERN CONCERNED ONE THAT I IS ISRAEL. POOR TOOL OF PHONEBOOK. THAT ARE RISK OF HATE MOTIVATE VIOLENCE. LAST YEAR THE VILLAGE CREATED THE CAL. NONPROFITS GRANT PROGRAM FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED TO. ASSIST NON PROFITS AT RISK OF HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE. ON THE PROGRAM IS DRAMATICALLY OVER SUBSCRIBE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FROM AROUND THE STATE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING- HISTORY UNFORTUNATELY TEACHES US THAT IN MOMENTS OF. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY HATE TENDS TO RISE AND- AND- VIOLENCE TENDS TO INCREASE HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE AND SO- YOU KNOW THIS FUNDING THAT GOES TO MOSQUE. AND SYNAGOGUES AND CHURCHES IN LGBT COMMUNITY CENTERS- IT'S REALLY BUDGET DUST- IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE BUT IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT TO. TO THOSE COMMUNITIES IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND SO. I THINK IT'S A REALLY POWERFUL MESSAGE WHEN WE- CREATED THE PROGRAM ALLOCATED THAT FUNDING AND I WOULD HATE TO SEND THE OPPOSITE MESSAGE AT AT AT. A MOMENT APPAREL IT WOULD BE. VERY INTERESTED WITH WITH THE LEAD TIME TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE ON THOSE ISSUES. YES IN TERMS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR I'D- HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY AT THE ROOT OF THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES THAT THIS NAY REVISION WAS BUILT. AND PROTECTING THOSE CAL WORKS GRANTS PROTECTING US ASIDE AT THIS P. GRANTS. YOU KNOW BASED. INCOME THAT'S PROVIDED TO FAMILIES THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE SO THAT THEY CAN PAY. FOR RENT AND FOOD- AND THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED- SO THOSE THAT. THAT'S ONE ASPECT AND WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF. FEDERAL MONEY COMING INTO THE STATE MUCH OF IT IS NOT COMING TO THE STATE BUT GOING DIRECTLY TO LOCAL- GOVERNMENTS IN THE FORM OF THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LOCK GRANT. I WE WANT TO WORK WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO MAXIMIZE THAT MONEY THE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN ADDITIONAL CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUN THAT. THE STATE IS PROPOSING TO ALLOCATE- TOWARDS THE PURCHASE. OF A LOW INCOME UNITS. I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HOW WE- HAVE SOME THOUGHTS. A LOT OF OTHER STRATEGIES THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ALL ON INCLUDING. I'M DIFFERENT BILLS- TO ADD REALLY LEVERAGE THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS AND EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS- TO REALLY CREATE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO NOT LOSE GROUND ESPECIALLY BUT ALSO THEY CONTINUE TO BUILD- ADDITIONAL. CAPACITY WE DEFINITELY NOTHING HAS CHANGED ON THE HOUSING CRISIS- WITH THE COBRA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I'M IN SOME CASES IT'S PROBABLY INTENSIFIED- BECAUSE OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THIS CRISIS ON ON LOW WAGE WORKERS. I AM AND WHO WHO TEND BE THE MORE HOUSE AND SECURE WORKERS. I CONTINUES TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- AND- WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MORE ON THAT IF I MAY MISTER JUST WANT TO ECHO MIGHT MY COMMENT. THE COMMENTS MY CARD FOR SINCE IT'S GONNA THANK YOU FOR. THE EMILY LOCUM HOUSE TAX CUT SIX SIX THE TAX CREDITS MIGHT BE A REALLY IF. WAY TELL PRESERVE SOME OF THAT. HOUSING STOCK AS YOU KNOW HAVE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS AT RISK OF DISAPPEAR. THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE MISSION DRIVEN NONPROFITS ACQUIRE ALL OF THAT. A TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR UNITS TO KEEP. YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSE OR JUST. HUMBLY OFFER THAT AND APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE ON THE ISSUES. THE MEXICAN ECONOMIST BONTA. CUNNINGHAM IN THIS KALRA AND THE MISS COME. THANK COLLEAGUES AND MISTER CHAIR I IN YOUR CAN INSTEAD AS A AS MISTER TECH AND THAT LEóN YOUR AND MISS FOSTER IN THE FROM TO FINANCE YOUR C. BRING ALL TOGETHER IN THE SYSTEM UP TO. OF THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AN OBVIOUS WERE ON. IN ON PRESS. TIMES IN A PANDEMIC. ECONOMIC RECESSION FACING A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT AND- RIGHT NOW. THAT REALLY CREATES THE PROSPECT OF HEARTBREAKING. AND GUT WRENCHING CUTS AND SO I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE TWO THEMES NOT SPECIFICS THE THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO A NUMBER SPECIFICS BUT TWO THEMES ONE THAT WE- DO A LOT OF US. HAVE ALREADY ASKED THAT WE DO WHICH IS KEEP OUR MOST VULNERABLE IN MIND. AND TOP OF MIND AS WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS AND TO. THAT WE PRIORITIZE. REVENUE OPTIONS MORE THAN WE HAVE SO FAR IN THIS DISCUSSION WE KNOW RIGHT NOW. THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BARELY HANGING ON OTHERS. CAN NO LONGER HANG ON WE KNOW. THAT FOLKS ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE AND SOME HAVE FALLEN OVER THE EDGE ALREADY WE KNOW THAT AN ECONOMIC. RECESSION HURTS FIRST AND HURTS WORSE THOSE MOST VULNERABLE. IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO FOLKS NEED US TO HELP THEM MORE NOT LESS. THEY NEED TO INVEST I'M NOT. THAT FROM THEM SO I REALLY ASK THAT WE CAN ARM VULNERABLE TALK SOME. ABOUT HERO. ARE ARE FOR. ASCENSION WORKERS. ARE SUPPLY CHAIN WORKERS FIRST WITH. ARE ARE HEALTH CARE. ARE TEACHERS IN CLASS OF WORKER. THEIR LITTER. FEEDING TEACHING MARK. KEY US SAFE KEEPING US HEALTHY. IN MANY CASES KEEPING US. MANY OF THEM. STAND TO LOSE SO MUCH FROM THE CUTS IN PROPOSED CUTS IN THIS BUDGET AND I KNOW THOSE CUTS. AREN'T DESIRED WE TAKE NO PLEASURE IN THEM- THERE ON. CONSEQUENCES BUT I REALLY ASKED THAT WE KEEP THAT EQUITY LANDS. AS WE VIEW OUR BUDGET AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT- WHO GOING TO BENEFIT IN GOING TO GET HURT BECAUSE THAT THOSE THE THAT. HURT MOST THE AT LEAST PREPARED TO BEAR THAT BURDEN. SO LET'S KEEP THAT IN IN MIND I KNOW SO MANY OF YOUR AND APPRECIATE THAT CONCEPT IN THAT IDEA AND THAT VALUE BEING UP LIFTED. SO MANY TIMES AND THEN I WANNA JUST APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE THINKING THAT'S GONE AND FROM. BOTH HOUSES FROM THE PARTNER FINANCE ELLIE- FROM THAT FROM THE GOVERNOR. I AND HOW TO BALANCE THE BUDGET SOME OF THEM I THINK. ARE ARE INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL BUT THEY ALSO HAVE- THE ALSO CREATE ANXIETY AND WORRY FOR ME. FOR EXAMPLE THAT FEDERAL. STIMULUS PROPOSAL I DEFINITELY SUPPORT THE HEROES ACT IN A WAY I KNOW SO MANY OF US DO IF THAT MONEY CAME INTO BE HUGE FOR US. BUT IT MAY OR MAY NOT. AND IF IT DOESN'T WE'RE GONNA FACE. IT TRIGGERS CUTS THAT ARE JUST INCREDIBLY PAINFUL AND DAMAGING AND HURTFUL TO SO MANY PEOPLE. THAT WE CARE ABOUT THE BARN PROPOSALS THAT WE'VE HEARD. ABOUT I DEFINITELY CAN HELP US NOW. BUT THEY NEED TO BE PAID BACK LATER AND- AT THE POTENTIAL COST IN PAIN AND HARM. TO SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES LATER CUTS NOW FOR SURE. HURT THOSE WHO ARE LEAST ABLE TO BEAR THAT BURDEN- SO I DO WANT TO ASK US TO. MAKE MORE CENTRAL AND AS A HIGHER PRIORITY MORE PROMINENT ARE DISCUSSED POSSIBILITY A REVENUE OPTIONS. I'M MISTER HEY. PROPOSED ONE EARLIER TODAY IT'S WORTH YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE KIND OF THINK WE NEED TO HAVE RIGHT NOW. A TWO MINUTE THE CUTS IN THE IN THE PEOPLE THAT WE OUGHT ABOUT. SO EL I WANT TO END WITH A. WHICH IS WE ARE TO HAVE. FOR RESPONSIBLE AND TO HAVE GOSH IT ABOUT AVENUE OP. WHY AND MISS BY MISTER TECH YOU SUGGEST BE THE PER THAT GUIDE THAT DISCUSS WHICH YOU BE THINK ABOUT ROOM EVERYDAY TAX BREAKS YOU WE WOULD TARGETING CERTAIN TAX. OR OR REVENUE. HOW DO YOU ARE THE LEAD. THINK ABOUT WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHICH IS INCREASING REVENUES TO HELP BALLOT A BUDGET IN A VERY TO I CAN SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK. THERE COULD BE A COUPLE OF IDEAS OUT THERE AS FAR AS TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT SOME OF THE STATE'S TAX EXPENDITURES. AND IN SOME CASES WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE TAX EXPENDITURES THAT EXIST- HAVE A QUESTIONABLE POLICY JUSTIFICATION. ARE THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER- THIS STEP UP BASIS ON INHERITED ASSETS WHERE- PERSON INHERITS AN ASSET IN IT'S NOT- RE PRICES TO MARKET VALUE- YOU COULD CONSIDER- MOVING THE- STATE'S TAX CODE MORE. IN LINE. WITH WHAT THEY CALL- CONFORMITY TO THE FEDERAL TAX CODE. AND PUT A LIMIT ON THE PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT- PEOPLE BENEFIT FROM CURRENTLY WITH THEIR LOCAL PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS. SO THERE ARE PROBABLY A RANGE OF OPTIONS AND I THINK OUR OFFICEWOULD BE HELD HAPPY TO. ASSIST WITH PROVIDING SOME OF THAT ANALYSIS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A POST ON OUR WEBSITE THAT TALKS THROUGH SOME OF THESE IDEAS SO. THERE ARE SOME IDEAS OUT THERE. THANK YOU MISTER BETTER. THANK THANK YOU OKAY AS THE VILLAINESS CUNNINGHAM AND THEN- MISTER KALRA MISS COM LAW ORDER IN MYSTERY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT OFTEN DO NOT HAVE A VOICE IN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT. THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEY ARE KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WELL THE SHELTER HOME ORDER WAS NECESSARY FOR A TIME. IT AT SERIOUS AND DIRECT CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO AN INCREASE IN CALLS FOR SERVICE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THAT'S WHY ON APRIL FOURTEENTH A COALITION OF LEGISLATORS TEN OF US ONE EIGHT THAT THIS BODY. SAID THE GOVERNOR REQUEST THAT HE USED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE SB EIGHTY NINE EMERGENCY RESPONSE FUND 1% OF THAT FUN. TO AUGMENT THE CAPACITY AT OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS. WE NEVER GOT A RESPONSE THAT REQUEST FROM THE GOVERNOR. NOT EVEN A RESPONSE. AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND I'VE SEEN THE NEGATIVE IMPACT MESSICK VIOLENCE HAS ON VICTIMS AND THEIR CHILDREN. THE IMPACT IS GENERATIONAL IT DOES GENERATIONAL DAMAGE TO FAMILIES AND TWO KIDS. AND SHELTER HOME MEANT FOR SOME PEOPLE BEING SHELTERED OR TRAPPED IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GO IS OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS IN MY HOME COUNTY CALL IS INCREASING THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF QUARANTINE. CALLS INCREASED OVER A 100% DOUBLE. THOSE SHELTERS ARE A LIFELINE FOR THOSE PEOPLE AND THEIR CHILDREN THEY'RE A LIFELINE WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE THAT INCLUDES THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THEY HAVE BEEN PUT IN DANGER IN A DIRECT AND FORESEEABLE FASHION BY GOVERNMENT STAY HOME ORDERS. THAT IS AN EMERGENCY COBIT SITUATION AND WE DIDN'T ANSWER FROM OUR GOVERNOR ABOUT THAT. NEXT WITH REGARD EDUCATION. ACCORDING TO THE NAY REVISED FIGURES PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING SLASHED BY FOURTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT. NON EDUCATION GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ARE ONLY BEING CUT BY FIVE PORT FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT. THE LA PREPARED THIS CHART. HOW THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SOLVING A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM THE BIGGEST CUT IS TO QUE THROUGH FOURTEEN EDUCATION BIGGEST PARTS 28% OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. THAT'S WRONG EDUCATION IS A CORE STATE GOVERNMENT FUNCTION IT'S THE TOP PRIORITY OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT. THE TOP PRIORITY THE VOTERS AGREE THAT'S WHY THE PRATT PASSED PROP NINETY EIGHT AND GUARANTEED A FLOOR FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATIONS BUT SPENDING. A FOR BUT IS NOW BECOME THE CEILING BECAUSE THIS BUDGET. IF EDUCATION IS TRULY OUR TOP PRIORITY IT SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING WE FIND AND THE LAST THING WE CUT. PERIOD WE'VE SEEN LEARNING LOSS FROM REMOTE LEARNING ALREADY. WE ASKED OUR TEACHERS ARE EDUCATORS ARE ADMINISTRATORS TO DO DIFFICULT AND CREATIVE AN UNPRECEDENTED THINGS AND THEY RESPOND. TO KEEP SOME SEMBLANCE OF EDUCATION GOING DURING WARRANTY. NOW WE'RE GONNA ASK THEM TO DO EVEN MORE AS WE START SCHOOL NEXT YEAR AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO WITH MUCH MUCH LESS. AND THAT'S WRONG. EDUCATION IS THE LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MILLIONS. EDUCATION IS THE PATHWAY TO COLLEGE TO A SKILLED TRADE. TO PUBLIC SERVICE TO THE MILITARY TO FUTURE CAREERS I'VE SEEN THIS IS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. I'VE SEEN IT MY OWN PERSONAL FAMILY HISTORY. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WE FOUGHT AS A BODY FOR FOUR YEARS TO GET CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PRIORITIZE AND FUNDED IN THIS BODY AND THIS BUDGET SLASHES IT IN HALF AND THAT'S WRONG. THAT IS THE LIFELINE FOR PEOPLE THAT IS THEIR PATHWAY TO A SKILLED PROFESSION WHERE THEY CAN MAKE A GREAT LIVING AND PROVIDE FOR THIRTY SECONDS. OUR KIDS DESERVE BETTER THAN A 14% CUT IN EDUCATION I KNOW TIMES ARE BAD BUT THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN A FOURTEEN PERCENT CUT BIGGER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN A RETREAT FROM OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL GO TO MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU SURE TING UNDER THE SPEAKER'S WELL DELEO AND GOVERNMENT MINISTRY GOVERNOR'S STAFF HERE. I WANT TO START WITH THOSE WITH A LOT BEHIND THE FEDERAL I WANTED THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS WORK ON A- THE IMMIGRANT IS RELIEF ASSISTANCE. I MORE NEEDS TO DONE.

I SURE THE PERSPECTIVE OF MORE THAN FORTY PROGRESSIVE AND ANTI POVERTY GROUPS WHO SENT A LETTER CALLING OUT CALLING OUT THE OLD CUTS BUDGET THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR THE STATE. THIS IS THE SAME PLAYBOOK THE STATE USE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND RESULTANT DECADES OF DIFFICULT RECOVERY. THE ONLY FURTHER EXACERBATE THE GREATEST INCOME INEQUALITY THAT HAS EVER BEEN MEASURED AND THAT WAS BEFORE-THE CRISIS OUR ECONOMY WAS BOOMING FOR THE FEW.

A MORAL DOCUMENT THIS IS NOT FOR US TO BE ABOUT IT ARE THROUGH THE LENS OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE. FOR THOSE MOST CONCERNED THAT OKAY COUNT ON ROAD THAT'S A COMMON TO REFER. BUT CHOICE ARE MADE BETWEEN POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. OVER PROTECTING THE PEOPLE WE ARE CAN. TO SERVE PREVENT HOMELESSNESS WE MUST PRESERVE AND HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE HOUSING IS HEALTHCARE PREVENT HUNGER BECAUSE ECONOMIC JUSTICE. LET US ALSO HAVE OF A ONCE BEFORE ABOUT.

WE DO NOT DIFFICULT TO MAKE LET US MAKE THE MORAL. TO ERR ON THE OF CAL FOR. TO CHOOSE A PATH TO GO TOGETHER. RATHER THAN MAKE CHOICES THAT DEAN SO SAID PROCESS. ON WHERE THE OF THE CAL DREAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE REYES AND KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR CONVENING THIS COMMITTEE OF WHOLE I THINK THIS IS A HISTORIC I WANT TO START BY SAYING YOU DON'T YOU FORTY HAVE A FAMOUS CALL CHOICE. AND ONE OF THE LEADER IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS CHOICES AND I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHOICES THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET ARE NOT ARE ONLY ONE. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT THE CUTS TO PROP FIFTY SIX- STRIP FUNDING FROM REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD MAKING US EQUALLY GUILTY OF BLOCKING ACCESS TO CRITICAL AND TIME SENSITIVE CARE THE TOTAL CUTS AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE WOULD BE ONE BILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE OF A NINE TO ONE FEDERAL MATCH. THESE CHOICES DON'T WORK FOR WOMEN LOW INCOME ETHNIC WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND ALSO WHO ARE THE PATIENTS OF SAFETY NET PROVIDERS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHO WILL BE CRIPPLED BY THE DEVASTATING CUTS TO MEDICARE ALL. AND FAMILY PACKED. THESE CHOICES ALSO DON'T WORK FOR CARE GIVERS AGAIN MOSTLY WOMEN WHO'VE TAKEN CARE OF SPOUSES AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE DIED OR HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED IN THE LONG TERM CARE WHO ARE STILL IN ELIGIBLE. FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS AND THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED. AS A MEMBER OF THE LOS THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I JUST HAVE TO SAY NO CUTS TO CHILD CARE PROTECTIVE. FULL STOP. AS A MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION I'M HERE TO SAY THAT TRIGGER CUTS TO THE M. OKAY HOSPITAL WILL BE A DEATH TRIGGER. TO THE SOUTH LA INTO THE ADJACENT COMMUNITIES WHAT THAT HOSPITAL SERVICE THAT IS A NO WIN PROPOSITION AT ALL COSTS. THE SPECIAL ED PROPOSAL IS NOT EQUITABLE FOR THOSE DISTRICT LIKE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT EDUCATE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE DISABILITIES. FAIR SHARE IS IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY FOR DISTRICTS THAT ARE THAT BIG YOU DO THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE PULLED THE RUG UNDER. UP FOR UNDER A YOU KNOW. I THINK IT'S SHORT SIGHTED THAT TO OUT THE PROPOSED. FOR PROBATE REFORM WE THIS IS THE WHEN CAN RE I'M- THE SIX. FOR WHAT PRO LOOKS LIKE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM WE NEED TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY SEEING THAT SO MANY OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND BEGINNING TO STREAMLINE AND LOOK AT HOW TO BE CREATIVE AS A RESULT OF COVERT. TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY NOW I BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE DONE. AND LASTLY WITH REGARD TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS THE GOVERNOR DID I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS RIGHT BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE VALLEY THE GOVERNOR STARTED THIS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS LET'S NOT STOP THE TRAIN BECAUSE OF KOBE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAX CUTS. I'M SORRY TO TAX CREDITS. AND THROUGH FUNDING AND TO LEVERAGING PRIVATE CAPITAL. TO BE INNOVATIVE AND HOW WE DO RIGHT BY THOSE WHO ARE ON HOUSEOR WHO ARE LIVING ON THE MARGINS WE CAN LOOK AT PHONES I GUARANTEE RENT FOR QUALIFY PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND WE CAN LOOK AT HOW TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THOSE. MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE CONNECTING ONCE AGAIN TO MISSION DRIVEN NONPROFIT. WE CAN CUT OUR WAY OUT OF THIS BUT THAT WILL NOT GIVE US WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING PEOPLE WOULD RATHER FAIL ON CONVENTIONALLY NO PEOPLE WOULD RATHER FAIL CONVENTIONALLY THAN SIX FEET ON CONVENTIONALLY. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED IN VERY UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS BY THINKING- ABOUT HOW TO LOOK AT THIS BUDGET INCISIVE LEISTER. LEVERAGING DOLLARS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND PASSING A BUDGET THAT IS DIGNIFIED SO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A TON OF NEW WANTS QUESTIONS AND WHAT I SAID BUT I ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE TIME THAT WE HAVE NOW TO REALLY BEGIN TO LOOK AT BOTH RVENUES AND ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND THINGS IN A WAY THAT WILL BE EFFICIENT AND STREAMLINED AND WILL BE DIGNIFIED FOR THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE STATE. THANK YOU. MISS ROSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS WE LEARN TO LEGISLATE DURING THESE UNPREDICTABLE AN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE NOT FORGET WHAT IS IT THAT LED US TO BECOME LEGISLATORS FOR ME LIKE FOR MANY OF YOU IT WAS IN NEED OF MY COMMUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE. AS THIS PANDEMIC ERUPTED IT BECAME CLEAR THAT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY COPE WITH NINETEEN. QUOTE IF YOU LIVE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY THE AIR YOU BREATHE MIGHT PUT YOUR YOUR HEALTH AT RISK. THIS IS FROM THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION SATED BEER REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE AL KNOW THAT STUDIES ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW THAT AIR POLLUTION EXACERBATES RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS FURTHER LEADING TO INCREASED DEATHS LINKED TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. GIVEN THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES THAT AIR QUALITY HAVE ALREADY HAD ON THE HEALTH OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND THE CORRELATION BETWEEN POOR AIR QUALITY AND AN INCREASE IN COPD NINETEEN DEATHS IT IS ESPECIALLY CLEAR THE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS LIKE AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATION AND PROGRAMS AIMED AT REDUCING EMISSIONS AT THE SOURCE OR MORE VITAL THAN EVER. THE DEATHS ARE NOT HAPPENING EQUALLY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LATINOS MAKE UP A 53% OF ALL POSITIVE CASES IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE DYING DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE COMPARED TO OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS. IN THESE DIRE TIMES WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES. ALL OF OUR FAMILIES INCLUDING ARE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE CONTINUING TO RECEIVE VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE DURING THIS PERIOD OF NEED COMPARED TO THEIR DOCUMENT APPEARS DESPITE MANY OF THEM MAKING UP OUR CENTRAL WORKERS. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY HOME TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AS WAS NOTED EARLIER WHO CONTRIBUTE WHAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN DIEGO NORTH HOLLYWOOD WHO AND OTHERS. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT KELLY I TO YOU SEE TO SERVE ALL CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS AS THE KELLY YEAH I TO SEE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT IN THE ECONOMY. OF MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BY EXTENDING THE KELLY I TO SEE T ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE TAX FILERS WE CAN TAKE SERIOUS AND JUST STEPS TO REDUCE THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED EFFECTS OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. FOR OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS MANY WHO COME FROM MIX STATUS HOUSEHOLDS WERE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY FILE WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THERE'S NO REASON THESE TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. MANY OF WILL MAKE UP OUR CENTRAL WORKFORCE SHOULD NOT BE RECEIVING THEIR EARNED TAX CREDIT AS CRUCIAL MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. FINALLY AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE I ASKED THE CALIFORNIA SAFETY NOT BE PROVIDED FOR PROTECTION OF OUR COMMUNITIES SO THEY DON'T FALL TO ROCK BOTTOM. CALIFORNIA'S ROAD TO RECOVERY SHOULD NOT BE PAID WITH CUTS TO THE VITAL SERVICES FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THE DIRE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF MOVING COMMAS AND DECIMALS. BUDGET COLUMN TO ANOTHER. THESE ADJUSTMENTS AUGMENTATIONS IN BUDGET SPEAK ARE NOT SIMPLY BUDGET ACCOUNTING FORMULAS BUT WILL IMPACT REAL PEOPLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WILL ALREADY FACE THE BRUNT OF COOL WOULD NINETEEN AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC SETBACKS OF THE GREAT RECESSION. WE MUST NOT BALANCE THE BUDGET ON THE BACKS OF THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED. I WANT TO ALSO LEARN MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM SANTA ROSA AND MY NEIGHBOR AND SAMBAR TO DO YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES OUR STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS OUR SENIORS ARE FOSTER YOUTH OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE VICTIMS ARE TEACHERS. THE AGENT IN THE POOR AND THE DISABLED SHOULD NOT BE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. AS WE BALANCE THE BUDGET. WILL WE REMEMBER. THAT WE BECAME LEGISLATORS TO GIVE A VOICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT THE VOICE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE VOICE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PROTECTED AND HAVE NOT PERSONALLY SUFFERED. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO STATED EARLIER. WE SHOULD REMAIN A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO AND THE NEXT WE HAVE MISTER ROBERT RIVAS MISTER JONES SAWYER AND THEN MISS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE LA COUNTY DELEGATION TO SPEAK OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF EDUCATION. I'M ALSO GOING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS LONG TERM CARE HOMELESSNESS AND LASTLY THE NEED TO RECOGNIZE CALIFORNIA I CAN TAX PAYER CONTINUED TO MARK TO BE MARGINALIZED. THROUGHOUT THE COVE IN NINETEEN CRISIS THE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THE LARGEST IN THE STATE SERVING APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS 73% OF WHOM ARE LATINO. 92% OF WHICH ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE SPANISH SPEAKERS FOLLOWED BY STUDENTS TO SPEAK ARMENIAN KOREAN TOOK ALL- CANTONESE IN VIETNAMESE. TO NAME A FEW. RENTS ARE FRUSTRATED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT DISTANCE LEARNING. TEACHERS ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE NEW PLATFORMS. AND MANY LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. LIKE INTERNET AND LAPTOPS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS REAL. AND THE CHIEF MAY GAP IS ONLY GROWING LARGER. AS WE KNOW EQUAL IT'S NOT THE SAME AS EQUITABLE. AND WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE. AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES WILL NOT PROVIDING THE FUNDING NECESSARY. WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIAL EDUCATION I REPRESENT THE MOST STUDENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE DISABILITIES. IN ALL OF ALLEY WAS THE- THE MAY REVISE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION EQUALIZATION PROPOSAL USES A FORMULA. THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT EQUITY. SINCE IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF SERVICE TO STUDENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE DISAILITIES NEED. THE STATE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A COVERT NINETEEN GENERATION OF STUDENTS WHO WILL. NOT LEARN TO READ BY THIRD GRADE READING LEVELS THERE BY ONLY INCREASING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON TO PRISON PIPELINE WHICH IS VERY REAL. MEMBERS OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. OUR STUDENTS DESERVE A FIGHTING CHANCE TO LEARN TO READ. AND REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. THIS IS WHY LA UNIFIED LABOR AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS I JOIN BY CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SAN DIEGO LONG BEACH SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND. TO REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AND HAVE SUBMITTED LETTERS WITH ALTERNATIVE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISED AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY SLASH WITH AN OVERALL FUNDING REDUCTION OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR STATEWIDE A 15% CUT COMPARED TO AN EIGHT POINT FUND. FOR LA'S BEST THIS WILL RESULT IN A DEFICIT OF OVER FIVE MILLION IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. AS THE LARGEST AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THE IMPACT OF THESE CUTS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT WORKING FAMILIES AND HINDER THE REGION'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE CURRENT CRISIS IS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH TEN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLICLY FUNDED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS 84% OF CHILDREN ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED NINE AND TEN OR CHILDREN OF COLOR ONE IN THREE OR ENGLISH LEARNERS. 25% ARE HOMELESS STUDENTS AND THE IMPACT WILL BE TO THIRTY THOUSAND JOBS. WHEN IT COMES TO LONG TERM CARE OLDER ADULTS 65% AND OVER. COUNT I'M SORRY 65% SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER ACCOUNT BUT YET AT THE MAY REVISED PROPOSES SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION TO CUTS TO SENIORS. INCLUDING 7% CUT TO AYE HSS ELIMINATING THE COMMUNITY BASED AT ALL SERVICE PROGRAM ELIMINATING THE ELIMINATION OF THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM IT TAKES AWAY VITAL BUT MEDI CAL BENEFITS SUCH AS EYE GLASSES HEARING AIDS DENTAL SERVICES. PHYSICAL THERAPY AND MANY MORE AT A TIME IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS OUT OF NURSING HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING WE SHOULD BE WE SHOULD NOT BE CUTTING SERVICES THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE SAFELY AT HOME. AND OUT OF HOSPITALS. WHEN IT COMES THIRTY. MINUTES THE CITY OF LA IS REELING WITH CONTINUED INCREASES TO WORK ON HOUSE POPULATION. THIS IS WHY ALSO SUPPORT. HELPING LEAD THE EFFORT OF TWO BILLION AND ONGOING AND I'M GOING FUNDING LASTLY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THE SENTIMENTS ECHOED BEFORE THERE ARE ONE POINT TWO MILLION I TO TAXPAYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TROOPS THREE POINT TWO BILLION. IN STATE TAXES IT IS WRONG. THE DEMOCRATIC CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE THAT TAXES AWAY FROM INDIVIDUALS AND TURN AROUND AND SAY YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF ANY HELP. THIS IS WHY I SUPPORT THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR AYE TEN TAXPAYERS. MEMBERS THE STATE IS FACING 25% UNEMPLOYMENT. NOTHING WE HAVE EXPRESSED TODAY MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE IS WHAT THE END OF THE DAY WE LACK A STRONG FOUNDATION IN EDUCATION THAT INSURERS. ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. WE MUST ACT WITH COURAGE AND MEET WITH THE MORE COMPASS THAT SERVES. FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THE CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHATEVER MISTER ROBERTS. ALL THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TING VICE CHAIR OBERNOLTE AND COLLEAGUES. NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO I BEGAN MY SERVICE- AS A MEMBER OF THE SEVEN OH COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I HAD TO DEAL WITH AT THAT TIME THE LINGERING ECONOMIC INSTABILITY THAT WAS BROUGHT ON BY THE GREAT RECESSION. UNEMPLOYMENT ARE COUNTY WAS AT NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT. A RECORD NUMBER OF LOCAL BUSINESSES HAD SHUT DOWN. AND HOUSING CONSTRUCTION WHICH ARE COUNTY SO- THAT WE DESPERATELY NEEDED HAD PRETTY MUCH COME TO A HALT. EVERYONE WAS AFFECTED TEN YEARS AGO. BUT WHAT BECAME CLEAR TO ME WITH THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WERE HURTING THE MOST. THESE WERE THE PEOPLE WONDERING WHETHER NEXT PAYCHECKS WOULD COME FROM. HOW THEY PAY THE RENT OR MORTGAGE THE NEXT MONTH. HOW THEY'D BE THEIR KIDS HOW THEY KEEP THEM SAFE. AND TO RESPOND TO THAT ECONOMIC CRISIS TO HELP THOSE MOST VULNERABLE WE CAME TOGETHER AS A COUNTY. WE FORGE NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL AND REGIONAL- MUNICIPALITIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. WE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. WE ARE FIREFIGHTERS WITH OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. WITH OUR POLICE AND SHERIFF'S OFFICERS WHAT ARE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE FORGE PARTNERSHIPS IN ORDER TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET. TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE AND TO ENSURE TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE WERE PROTECTED. IT WASN'T EASY BUT WE DEALT WITH THE CHALLENGES TO GATHER. IN OUR COUNTY WAS STRONGER IN THE END. NOW OUR STATE FINDS ITSELF ONCE AGAIN IN A MOMENT OF ECONOMIC CRISIS NONE OF US HERE. KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THIS CRISIS IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY. IF WE ACT WISELY IN THIS MOMENT IF WE COME TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD A STRONGER STATE WE CAN BUILD A STRONGER CALIFORNIA. OUR RESPONSE AS A STATE MUST BE ROBUST AND SET AN EXAMPLE FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. FOR THE MORE I WOULD ASK ALL OF YOU HERE. MY COLLEAGUES IN THOSE LISTENING TO OUR DISCUSSION PLEASE NOT TO FORGET ABOUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE IN THE STATE. MANY OF YOU KNOW MY STORY I WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE PARENT MY MOTHER BY MY GRANDPARENTS THEY WERE IMMIGRANTS IMMIGRANT FARMWORKERS. AND IN THIS CRISIS THE CENTRAL WORKERS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FORGET ABOUT OUR HARD WORKING FARMWORKERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE CONTINUE TO FEED OUR COUNTRY THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. WHETHER THEY ARE DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED. THEY HAVE WORKED TO PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLE. ON AND ON THE TABLES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE OWE IT TO THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. A DECENT HOME FOR THEIR FAMILY. ANY NUTRITIOUS FOOD TO EAT AND IN THIS PANDEMIC IT IS THE REMINDED US I KNOW IS REMINDED ME OF A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH A TRUTH. THAT AT THIS. THAT THAT AS A STATE AS A AS A COUNTRY WE OFTEN OVERLOOK AS A SIDE. AT THAT AT A RISK TO SOME OF US IS A RISK TO ALL OF US. WE ARE ONLY AS HEALTHY AS ARE MOST VULNERABLE. THIRTY SECOND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO FIND THE BEST PATH FORWARD TO PROTECT OUR GREAT STATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. OKAY WELL GOODNESS FRIEDMAN SHE SEEMS READY THEY WILL GO OF MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU A THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO FIRST THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOME SPEAKER RENDON AND CARE TING FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT REALLY A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT AREAS- ALL DEALING WITH THIS BUDGET AND HOW IT IMPACTS RECOVERY OUR ABILITY TO REBUILD IS A STATE AND RESILIENCY WHICH I THINK SHOULD OR OUR MANTRA. AFTER ANY KIND OF DISASTER. YOU KNOW WE TALKED FOR A LONG TIME. ON THIS FLOOR IN THIS BODY. ABOUT HOW. SO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF PAYCHECKS AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN AND WE'VE NOW SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE HAVE AN ENTIRE STATE. THAT LOSES ITS PAYCHECK FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD SHOW US THAT OUR ECONOMY IS NOT NEARLY AS RESILIENT. AS WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG TIME AND ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WORKED EXTREMELY WELL FOR A VERY FEW AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. AND WE TALK ABOUT REBUILDING AND RECOVERY I HOPE THAT A RECOVERY IS NOT AS WITH AN EYE TOWARDS GETTING BACK WHERE WE BECAUSE IT DOES HOW TO SOLVE THOSE ISSUES THAT LED TO SO MANY CALIFORNIANS BEING. JUST A COUPLE OF PAYCHECKS AWAY FROM LOSING THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. NOW COLBERT NINETEEN IS HIDDEN CERTAIN POPULATIONS MORE THAN OTHERS. IT'S NO SURPRISE TO A LOT OF US THAT IT'S HIT. ARE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE BLACK IN OUR BROWN COMMUNITIES MORE THAN IT'S HEARD A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO GO INTO THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S GENETICS. I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH SYSTEMIC IN LONG TERMS UNDER INVESTMENTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THOSE POPULATIONS. AND THE RESULTS THAT THAT'S HAD OF BEEN REALLY- TRAUMATIC AND WE'VE GOT A FIX THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR BUDGET DOESN'T DO MORE HARM. TO THOSE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR INVESTMENTS. IN CHILD CARE. IN HEALTH OUTCOMES AND ARE HEALTH FACILITIES. IN OUR ELDERLY WHO ARE FRAIL AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED IN OUR FOSTER YOUTH WHO WERE SO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HOMELESSNESS. AND BY LATER ON A- GOING INTO PRISONS. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS THAT IN LOS ANGELES ALREADY WORK REALLY THE SAME OF THE STATE AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THAT EXPONENTIALLY WORSE. CERTAINLY IN EDUCATION WHICH SHOULD BE THE PRIDE OF OUR STATE. ON THE OTHER THING I WANT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BEFORE I GET TO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. IS REALLY. RESILIENCY AT MAKING SURE THAT WHAT WE INVEST THAT WE DON'T. PULL INVESTMENTS FROM SOME THAT THEY MIGHT HELP BALANCE BUDGET. BUT THE ON THE ROAD ACOSTA EXT. MORE BECAUSE THEY WERE PROGRAMS THAT KEPT US SAFE. SAFE THAT EITHER KEPT US PHYSICALLY SAFE BECAUSE OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE OR KEPT OUR COMMUNITY SAFE BY INVESTING IN THOSE SOCIAL PROGRAMS. AND LATER- OF FUTURE GENERATIONS EVEN MAYBE JUST FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WE'RE GOING TO COST US MUCH MUCH MORE. IN NOT JUST IN OUR BUDGET IN FINANCIAL TERMS. BUT IN OUR IN HUMAN CALL AUSTIN REAL HE COST WEAPONS ABOUT A- OF THE- FIRST AS I MAY. HOUSE AND HOME. NOW IT'S S. THAT SHORTAGE A AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN AND CAL DEPRESSES THE GDP. JUST ACROSS THE TAKE EL MATCH AREA BY MORE THAN TWO PECENT. THIS TRANSLATES INTO EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN LOST OUTPUT. JUST FOR THE LOS ANGELES REGION AND ALMOST DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT FOR ALL OF LA COUNTY. I URGE YOU TO SWITCH OUT TO SPECIFY THAT THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE WARDS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREVENTION TAX CREDITS. THIS ALLOWANCE CAN PRESERVE THE AFFORDABILITY OF ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES AND MOBILE HOMES SPACES. NOW FOSTER YOUTH. ALREADY IN SUCH A PRECARIOUS POSITION IN OUR STATE. I'M WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATIONS CUTS TO VITAL PROGRAMS TAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET WE RISK. IRREPARABLE HARM THOUGHT THAT COMMUNITY. WE HAVE DO YOU PROPOSE ELIMINATE THE HOUSING NAVIGATOR PROGRAM WHICH WILL A JUST. IMPACT ON FOSTER USE. AND I JUST WANTED TO IS ALSO SAY AND I WANTED TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THIS SO IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE OF SECONDS. AS CHAIR OF NATURAL. RESOURCES COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROLE BACK OF KEY PROGRAM SERVICE AND- FUNDING SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO WILD FIRE. I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS AT HOW FUNDING IS ALLOCATED IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION WE HAVE COMMUNITIES AT HIGH POPULATION COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VERY HIGH RISK. OF WILDFIRE BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE CHAPARRAL AND NOT HIGH VALUE FOREST'S. LOS ANGELES ONLY RECEIVES A OF SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FUNDS FOR THE KINDS OF REMEDIATION AND MITIGATION. THAT COULD REALLY REDUCE RISK ALL ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INVEST IN ECOLOGICAL HABITATS- RESTORATION AND PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW. THAT TIME WILL SAVE US IN TERMS OF HUMAN LIVES AND ALSO IN FINANCIAL COST. THANK YOU- AT MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU. GOING TO GO TO A JONES SAWYER THAN WE HAVE. MISS REPEAT. AND THEN MISTER GRAYSON AND THEN MISS POLLY. THAT YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AND IN. AND CHAIRMAN KING AND CHAIR OVER I ALSO WANT TO THANK GOD NEW SO FOR HIS COULD WORKING YOU RELEASED FOR TO THIS. IS BIASED A FUND FOR AND UNDOCUMENTED. HOWEVER LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS DROP CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IN MY DISTRICT WERE ALREADY VULNERABLE TO HEALTH AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES BEFORE KOBE NINETY AND WILL FACE MORE HARDSHIPS AS RECOVER FROM THIS CRISIS THAT IS WHY I ASKED THE GOVERNOR NOT ONLY FOR FUNDING FOR UNDOCUMENTED BUT ALSO ASKING FOR A TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT COVERT NINETEEN AND ESPECIALLY WHY AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS SUFFER MORE SO NOT ONLY ECONOMICALLY. BUT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT HAVE OCCURRED AS A MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION OUR PRIORITIES ARE HEALTH EDUCATION HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS THEY WERE BOTH MY DISTRICTS PRIORITIES AND ALSO WITH THE DELEGATIONS PRIORITIES EVEN BEFORE PROVIDE NINETEEN AND HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. I HOWEVER BY. BY THIS DISEASE AND IF. IT'S BECOME MORE CRUCIAL AS A RESULT OF JAPAN DAMAGE. IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE DO SOMETHING NOW. AND THAT IS WHY I'M GOING TO PROPOSE A SOUTH LOS ANGELES ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN. KIND OF STIMULUS PACKAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT SOUTH LOS ANGELES WHICH IS ONE OF THE POOREST DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS A VERY VERY EASY WAY A VERY LARGE CRACK THAT IS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THIS PANDEMIC. WELL I WOULD BE PROPOSING IS HEALTH CARE FUNDING FOR CLINICS IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES WE DON'T HAVE HOSPITALS WE HAVE LIKE NINETY NINE POINT 99% OF THE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED BY CLINICS SO WE SHOULD RETURN ONE POINT TWO BILLION IMPROPER. FIFTY SIX FUNDS INCREASE STIMULUS FOR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS UNDER TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOULD DOUBLE THE FIVE HUNDRED ALREADY RELEASE. UNTO PROHIBITION ON CAL E. I. T. C. FOUR E. I. T. N. OUR FLIGHT OF FILERS SIXTY FIVE MILLION TO SUPPORT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY BANKS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY BRIDGE FOR LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GIVE TO IMMIGRANTS FOR FUNDING IN MY DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE THIS SMALL BUSINESSES THERE ARE MOSTLY. FROM IMMIGRANT POPULATION THE LARGEST SINGLE PROVIDER YES IS UNIVERSITY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT PALES IN COMPARISON THE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS IN ABOUT IT PEOPLE THAT THE EMPLOYEE. NEXT LAUSD. I HAVE THE MOST LA YOU SCHOOLS. ENDED AND THE- MOST CHARTER SCHOOL. IN THE DISH. I'M ASKING TO REJECT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EQUALIZATION FORMULA- SCHOOL FUNDING HAVE INCLUDE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE. WE HAVE TO START CREATING JOBS THAT ARE SUSTAINABLE AND LONG LASTING IN A- CAREER ORIENTED. AND THEN FINALLY. LOOKING AT NEW RESEARCH NEW SOURCES OF INCOME COMING INTO TO THE CAPITAL I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TAXES. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PUTTING A BURDEN ON ONE PERSON I'M TALK ABOUT LOOKING INTO THIRTY SO WHAT WE CAN DO NOW LIKE AMNESTY FOR FINES AND FEES THAT IN THE COURT SYSTEM THEY HAVE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FINES AND FEES IF WE JUST HAD AN AMNESTY PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN GET A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS% BACK. THAT WOULD BE GREAT DRAW DOWN ON A MAXIMUM FEDERAL FUNDS FEMA. I USED TO BE IMMERSED PARENTS COORDINATOR DEAR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE CAN GET BACK FROM FEMA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY JUST FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION. FEMA HAS MONEY FOR DISASTERS LIKE THIS THAT WE CAN GET REIMBURSED IN THE BILLIONS AND WE'RE NOT ACTIVATING THAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND FINALLY WORKING WITH THE PART PART TO NOT ONLY MINIMIZED CUTS BUT HAVE IMPORTANT WITH THIS SO IF THEY DO FINE A WAY THEY CAN BE CAN. COME UP WITH REVENUE WITHOUT INCREASING FEES AND FINES IN TEXAS. WE SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BY CUTTING THE BUDGET SHOULD INCENTIVIZE THEM MAKE SURE TO BUDGET STAY THE SAME IT MAY BE GIVEN 10% OF WHAT THEY FINE. OTHERWISE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR THEM TO DO IT BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICES IS ONCE THEY RAISE MONEY OR LOWER THEIR THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO DO THINGS WE CUT THEM DOWN EVEN MORE SO IN THE BUDGET AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE MORE REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS. THAT DO NOT AFFECT THE GENERAL FUND AND DO NOT AFFECT THE WAY WE TAX THE- THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO. MISS BETWEEN THE- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES I SHARE THE CONCERN THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPRESSED TODAY THAT HAD THE CUTS AS A PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISE WOULD HIT THE CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. IF I GOT HURT BREAKING HEARTBREAKING CUTS TO CHILD CARE EDUCATION TO HEALTH CARE TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE TO OUR SENIORS I THINK FOR ME AS- AS A MOTHER AND AS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY THAT CUTS THAT I FIND MOST HEARTBREAKING. THIS THE FACT THAT THIS BUDGET FAILS CALIFORNIA'S KIDS AND WE TALK ABOUT DEVASTATING CUTS TO EDUCATION IT'S NOT JUST A LINE ITEM IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA KIDS IN IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. OB SO. COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU DIRECTOR AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. BEFORE WE CONTEMPLATE ANY OF THESE TRULY DEVASTATING CUTS. IN BEFORE WE ASK CALIFORNIA'S TAXPAYERS TO OPEN THEIR WALLET EVER WIDER I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE REALLY HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND REALLY SCRUTINIZE. OUR SPENDING AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING CALIFORNIA'S TAX DOLLARS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY SO MY COLLEAGUE FROM MERCED MENTIONED. I'M THAT OVER THE COURSE I THINK IT'S THE PAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN A 70% GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES AND NON EDUCATION GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. AT THE SAME TIME THAT OUR POPULATION HAS GROWN BY TEN PERCENT. WITH HELP ME WRAP MY MIND AROUND THAT BECAUSE THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A TON OF OPPORTUNITY THERE- AND THEN QUESTION TO YOU YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE ONE SIDE THAT TALKS ABOUT. OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY SAID THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M WOULD LOVE TO AGAIN JUST UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR THAT. AS WELL AS A WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WERE EXPLORED EVALUATED AND- ANGELES HONEST AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO CONFRONT. AS WE SAID IN A PRESS BASIS. AT ME IN FREE FALL. THANK YOU I'M INTO OF AS THAT THE GROWTH OF THE NON EIGHT XP THE BIG COME. OF THE NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE- I'M OUR UPS HEALTH IN HUMANS. HIGHER AND THE CORRECTIONAL BUDGET- THOSE ARE THE MAIN COMPONENTS- THERE'S ALSO DEBT SERVICE- THERE ARE PENSION COSTS AS WELL THAT ARE SPREAD AMONG THE GENERAL FUND AND SPECIAL FUNDS AND THEN THERE ARE SOME GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES AND IN BOTH NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY MAINLY PARKS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE WHICH WERE WIDE THOSE TWO DEPARTMENTS IN THAT ENTIRE. TIRE AGENCY WERE- THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE BUDGET AND AT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PROPOSED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE A PROFICIENT WILDLIFE AND THOSE THOSE ARE REALLY THERE'S A LOT OF. A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THOSE RESOURCES AGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ARE BOTH OF FUNDED WITH SPECIAL FUNDS THE SAME WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AS WELL. SO A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AND WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION- TO MEDI CAL WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT I'M COVERING ALL. AS A LOW INCOME I CALIFORNIANS- AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATES AT AND SIGNIFICANTLY AND FUNDING THAT. WE'VE ALSO BEEN A TO MAKES INVESTMENTS IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT HAVE BEEN VERY VERY IMPORTANT. ADD TO THAT SPENDING ACCESS TO A SPECIAL ADDRESSING ISSUES OF EQUITY. SO THERE'S A FEW OF THE THINGS ACT ON TERMS DEBTS. WE FAX TO. OVER THE AT IN TERMS OF OUR RATIO WHICH IS GOOD WE'VE BEEN PAYING DOWN DEBT AND WE PAID OFF ECONOMIC RECOVERY BONDS THAT WERE FOUND- IT TO REST. REALLY BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION WITH WINDOWS WERE ISSUED- SO THAT'S- WHAT ONE GOOD A GOOD NEWS- THERE'S BEEN OTHER AUGMENTATIONS- ALONG THE WAY A LOT OF IT IS RESTORING SERVICES- THAT WERE LOST DURING THE GREAT RECESSION THAT. THE MAJORITY OF- WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IN TERMS OF- PROVIDER RATES AND OTHER OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND DENTAL UNFORTUNATELY WHAT FORTUNATELY WAS WAS JUST RESTORED AND THAT THIS MAY REVISION DOES. NOT PROPOSED ELIMINATE THE ENTIRE RESTORATION OF DENTAL- JUSTIN JUST THE PARTIAL- BECAUSE OF THAT IT WILL YOU KNOW WHAT ABSENT FEDERAL FUNDS BUT INTER OF- OVERALL GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCIES I'LL GO BACK TO THAT ON THE GO. IS TO REALLY LOOK AT EVERY DEPARTMENT ACROSS THE STATE GOVERNMENT NOT JUST GENERAL FUND DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO SPECIAL FUND DEPARTMENTS. AND LOOK FOR APPROXIMATELY 5% REDUCTION IN THIS IS STATE OPERATIONS THE BULK OF THE MONEY THAT GOES THROUGH THE STATE'S BUDGET GOES TO FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE- SO STATE OPERATIONS IS REALLY THE STATE STATE EMPLOYEES. AND THE OPERATION OF GOVERNMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND SO OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS- WILL BE LOOKING AT. IT EFFICIENCIES THAT WE CAN MAKE- WHETHER THAT BE REDUCE SEEN OFFICE SPACE ESPECIALLY IN LEASE SPACE WE HAVE A LOT OF REAL ESTATE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'M CAN WE DO MORE- TO CAPITALIZE ON ALL OF THE TELEWORK THAT'S HAPPENING AND FIND WAYS TO REDUCE OUR FOOT PRINTS ARE REAL ESTATE FOOT PRINT- AND SAVE MONEY THERE- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS TO PUT MORE- SERVICES ONLINE TO AND- TO INCREASE- CONVENIENCE FOR THE PUBLIC. I'M DURING THIS PANDEMIC A DMB WAS ABLE TO PUT ONLINE I'M ESPECIALLY WITH THE ADVENT OF THE VIRTUAL OFFICE VISIT- THAT REALLY I THINK CAN IMPROVE THE CONVENIENCE FOR THE PUBLIC. BUT ALSO CAN SAVE- MONEY OVER TIME THESE THINGS ARE NOT EASY THEY WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO IMPLEMENT SOME. WHY SHOULD. THAT'S TECHNIQUE HE I THAT CAN MODERNIZE OUR CURRENT BUT IT'S- ARE. OP AGENCY IS GOING TO BE LEADING. I AB STTE WHY WE'RE- OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE COPAYS ADD IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TRIP BY. THEY PASSED A- WE'VE ALSO MADE THESE. WHICH IS TO ALLOW. ALL AND THAT'S TRAVEL- AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PURCHASES REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NEW VEHICLES THAT ARE PURCHASED. I'M REALLY TRYING TO- ADD MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY IS BEING SPENT WISELY- AND- TOWARDS- YOU KNOW THE EFFECTIVE. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SO. AN AD THAT'S GOING TO BE- SOMETHING THAT'S ON GOING- OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS- TO REACHED THAT- THAT GOAL. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO MR GRAYSON MISSED ALI. MR GLORIA AND THEN MISTER SANTIAGO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO GIVE MUCH THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP MISTER SPEAKER MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY. I LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH CONSTITUENTS AND LOCAL LEADERS AND MY DISTRICT. AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN HAVE HAD CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST VULNERABLE VERY HARD. AND FOR MANY PEOPLE DURING THIS TIME THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY SO ANXIOUS- INTEREST SPIRITS ARE UP AND AS WE RAPIDLY APPROACHED CRAFTING A BALANCED BUDGET. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT UST A FEW AREAS OF CONCERN NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR MY DISTRICT AS WELL. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD NEWS REPORTS ARE MOUNTING HOT OF HIGHER RATES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS STAY HOME ORDERS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. NUMEROUS ARTICLES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED AN ALARMING DROP IN CHILD ABUSE AND THE REASON WHY THIS IS ALARMING IS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TEACHERS WHO OFTEN MAKE THESE REPORTS HAVE NOT SEEN THEIR STUDENTS IN MONTHS. THERE'S BEEN A DISTURBING INCREASE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDER SUICIDES THIS SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH EFFECT. ANY CALLOW. WE ARE TWENTY FOUR JUSTICE CENTERS THE PROVIDES THE SERVICES TO VICTIMS INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. PLASTIC BRACKETS ACTUAL SOUL JOE ABUSE ELDER ABUSE AND HUMAN. SO AS WE ARE LOOK FOR A- TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE KEPT HEALTHY AND SAFE DURING THESE TIMES WE SHOULD CONSIDER FUNDING THE EXISTING CENTERS LIKE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS AND OUR NEXT THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES PROVIDING IS WHY. BEING SERVICES. STATEWIDE ORDER TO CHILDREN. CHILD CARE SO AND FAMILY CARE HOMES CAN TO REMAIN. AS A SENSE BUSINESS. AS CALIPH URGING THE CENTRE TO RE OPEN DURING THE- NINETEEN PANDEMIC THIS ALSO MUST PER CLICK. FOR OF FAMILY CARE HOMES. BUT WE HAVE TO BE FOR. AND CREATE TO OUR- FOR ENSURING EQUAL. TO THE EAST OF TO CHILD CARE FINDING AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR MANY FAMILIES AND ACCESS DIFFERS BASED ON GEOGRAPHY RACE. ETHNICITY AND INCOME THERE ARE MANY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ACCESS THAT THE STATE CAN CONSIDER BOTH WITHIN THE BUDGET. AND THROUGH LEGISLATIVE ACTION. THE PANDEMIC INDUCED RESET A RECESSION COMBINED WITH MANDATORY SOCIAL DISTANCING STRINGENT SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND ANTICIPATED REDUCTIONS AND CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DELIVER SERVICES TO THE HOUSING INDUSTRY. WILL DRASTICALLY IMPACT ALL SEGMENTS OF A COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM THAT DELIVERS THE ESSENTIAL HOUSING CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO COMBAT THE HOUSING CRISIS. WELL PROJECT ROOM KEY WAS A FIRST STEP TO ENSURING HOMELESS IN OUR STATE- THE HAVE SAFE HOUSING CONDITIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC IT WAS ONLY JUST A FIRST STEP. AND WE MUST CONSIDER LONG TERM SOLUTIONS FOR HOUSING THE HOMELESS WITH. AND INCLUDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES. CALIFORNIA'S FACING A HELPING CRISIS AND A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN MADE WORSE BY THE BY OVER NINETY. US HAVE BEEN ALL THE- OF THIS. AND IT'S BEEN HIT HARD THEY WILL NEED TO PRESERVE PUBLIC EDUCATION PUBLIC HEALTH. MAKES THE JOB. FOR A- THE CITY OF. MIGHT HAVE TO CUT THE POLICE. BY APPROX SEVEN PER WE NEED TO DEDICATE FUNDING FOR OUR LOCALITIES WHO ARE ALREADY GRAPPLING WITH BUDGET DEFICITS SO THEY DO NOT WORK ON THESE CRITICAL. NEED POSITIONS AND SPEEDY BROKE. JUST A OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES AS THE AS MEASURE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS INC. NOT ALL LOSE WILL BE FOUND IN BUDGET THERE MUST BE LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT WORKS IN TANDEM WITH THE BUDGET TO PROVIDE RESULTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN SAFELY RE OPEN AND STAY AFLOAT. AND TO MAINTAIN OUR POSITION A VIBRANT JOB CREATION AND ALLOWING FOR BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THE STATE MEMBERS. WE NEED RESULTS SO THAT PEOPLE% ARE NOT LIMITED TO FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL BUT ARE ABLE TO PROSPER AND LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO MISS DOLLARS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ELLIE- STAFF ECHO MANY OF THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE EDUCATION CUTS EDUCATION SHOULD BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY THIS IS A FAILURE AND PRIOR TRACING THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS SCHOOLS AND PARENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHO ARE STRUGGLING. FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT COULD BE RE PURPOSED TO MEET THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF OUR SCHOOLS TO KEEP THEM AFLOAT. SECONDLY AS OUR STATE INTEREST FIRE SEASON THE MAY REVISE FAILED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SUPPORT TO ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT BASE CAMP RESOURCES ACROSS. THE STATE. FAIRS THE BUDGET INCLUDES FORTY MILLION GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS ONLY TO STATE AGENCY FAIRS EVEN CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FOUR COUNTY FAIRS WITH NO SUPPORT THE MAY REVISE ALSO DELETE THE EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WAS ORIGINALLY INCLUDED IN JANUARY BUDGET THIS IS A FUNDING GENERATED BY FAIRS AND DESIGNED TO BENEFIT. ALL FAIRS IN THE NETWORK. MY CONCERN WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS IT TAKES FROM ALL THAT ALL WHO PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE AND GIVE IT TO A FEW. NGUYEN CAO FIRE NEEDS A FAIR GROUNDS FOR BASE CAMP DURING FIRE SEASON IT DOESN'T ASK IF THE PROPERTY IS A COUNTY FAIR OR STATE AGENCY FAIR. THE BUDGET SHOULD BE ALTERED TO INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATION OF EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION IN SELF GENERATED FUNDS FOR FAIRS. IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSED FORTY POINT THREE MILLION WHICH SHOULD BE A AVAILABLE TO ALL FAIRS FINALLY THAT TIME WHEN ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE COULD BE. NOT COULD NOT BE MORE CREEK CRITICAL THE PROPOSED CUTS TO PROP FIFTY FIFTY SIX PROVIDER RATE WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES. THESE VOTER APPROVED RATES HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE IN ELIMINATION OF THIS FUNDING WILL EXACT RATE THE RULE HEALTHCARE CRISIS. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHY WAS THE DECISION MADE TO LIMIT THE FORTY POINT THREE MILLION ALLOCATION TO STATE AID AGENCY FAIRS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR COUNTY FAIRS WHEN ALL FAIRS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDERS HE RESPONSE. SO THE FOR THE FORTY POINT THREE MILLION IS ACTUALLY FOR A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE- BECAUSE FAIRS- ARE NOT GOING TO BE. ABLE TO OPERATE IN AND DO THE NORMAL- AND REVENUE GENERATING THEY'RE IN A POSITION OF NEEDING TO IMMEDIATELY START TO. LAY OFF STAFF- THOSE FAIR EMPLOYEES OUR STATE STAFF- AND SO THERE IS A PROCESS THAT THAT THEY MUST GO THROUGH. AND SO INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE FAIRS WITH A SHORTAGE OF MONEY TO AT LEAST CONTINUE THE PAYROLL UNTIL ALL OF THEN THE NOTIFICATIONS IN THE PROCESS GOES GOES THROUGH. AND THAT MONEY WAS PROVIDED- AND ADD IT AND THOSE ARE FOR ALL OF THE FAIRS THAT HAVE- STATE EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU SO IN CLOSING SUPPORTING FIRE PREPAREDNESS AND HEALTH CARE OR WHERE WE SHOULD BE PLACED IN OUR PRIORITIES. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER GLORIA THAN MISTER SANTIAGO. MR BIGELOW IN THE MISTER FALL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OF QUESTION FOR FINANCE CURIOUS WHEN- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE ACTION ORDER TO AVOID THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRIGGER CUTS IN THIS BUDGET. WHAT DATE. SORRY THE WAY THE TRIGGER IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED- THE REDUCTIONS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT ON JULY ONE. AND LAST THERE ARE FEDERAL FUNDS- THERE'S A PROJECT PROVISION IF ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS- COME IN LATER THIS SUMMER- THEY THOSE THOSE CUTS COULD BE REVERSED- BUT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S HOW THEY WOULD GO. THE SECOND QUESTION YOU PRESENTATION THE BUDGET THE PROPOSES UTILIZING THE RAINY DAY FUND TO HELP. BALANCE THE BUDGET DOES THIS BOOK BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR SEAT MAKING ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR RESERVES IN THIS FISCAL YEAR. IT DOES NOT OKAY IT DOES NOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THE VICE CHAIR AS WELL THE DEPRECIATION DOOR GOVERNOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. A TO OUR SPEAKER FOR THIS A HISTORIC CONVENING- OF COURSE TO THE COMMITTEE- IT STAFF AND INTO OUR LA WHO DOES A MASTERFUL JOB IN HELPING TO TAKE COMPLEX SUBJECTS TO MAKE IT RELATABLE EVEN TO THOSE OF US THAT ARE LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THEM. I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT I STARTED MY ELECTED SERVICE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION I RECOGNIZE THE BOUNCING A BUDGET. DURING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS WILL NOT BE EASY NOR WILL BE PAINLESS- FROM SPENDING REDUCTIONS TO PAY CUTS TO REVENUE HIKES YOU THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US OUR ATTRACTIVE. I WORRY THAT THIS PROPOSED BUDGET LEAVES A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT DEPLETES THE RAINY DAY FUND INCREASES DEBT AND OTHER LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS AND LEAVES FUTURE LEGISLATORS WITH EVEN WORSE OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM. IN THE YEARS TO COME. AS WE CONSIDER HOW THE STATE WILL EXPAND ITS LIMITED RESOURCES I THINK THAT WE WOULD DO OURSELVES AND OUR CONSTITUENTS A GREAT SERVICE IF THIS BUDGET IS PAIRED WITH A ROBUST STATE STIMULUS PLAN. THAT SPEAKS TO THE NEED TO GET CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK WE MUST EXPLAIN HOW OUR ACTIONS. IN THE BUDGET AND OUTSIDE OF IT WILL HELP PUT THE STATE CALIFORNIANS ON THE JOB GET BUSINESS IS A COMMUNITIES GOING AGAIN AND GROW THE REVENUES THAT WE NEED TO PROPERLY SERVICE ARE FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS. FIRST WE MUST WILL PROBABLY MUST BE MUST BE THE PROPER FUNDING OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. THIS IS NOT ONLY AN IMPERATIVE FOR PARENTS LOOKING TO RETURN TO WORK BUT IS CRITICAL FOR TRAINING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THEY ARE OF COURSE OUR FUTURE TAXPAYERS. I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF OUR LARGE URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE QUESTIONED THE EDUCATIONAL FUNDING DECISIONS IN THIS BUDGET AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL BE ADDRESSED. I THINK THAT'S ALSO TRUE FOR THE UTILIZATION OF POP SIXTY FIFTY SIX MONTHS PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE. SECONDLY I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE NIMBLE ACTION OF STATE AGENCIES TO INNOVATE DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES IN PARTICULAR ACKNOWLEDGE THE ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL. ALT OFFICES WHO ARE SUPPORTING LOCAL BUSINESSES BY AUTHORIZING TAKE AWAY COCKTAILS AND HOW DOOR DINING RIGHT NOW I JUST GIVE A SHOUT. OUT TO TAKE WE COCKED DOES DO NOT TAKE THEM BACK. THAT IS NOT GONNA BE RECEIVE. WHAT OTHER THAN NO IN LOW COST. CAN AGING. AND NOW. RIGHT NOW TO BUSINESS AND CAL. GAY TO WORK WHAT. CAN BE. FOR CRITICAL EDUCATE HEALTH AND SAFETY. I GREW SUCH REGULAR RELIEF. NOW NOT LATER. THIRD INTEREST INVEST HAS ALL BEEN A- ME OF I CAN. STATE HOW CAN STATE FUNNY BE USED TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT CAN BE BUILT DID IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. HOW CAN WE BE SURE GAS TAX REVENUES ARE FULLY EMPLOYED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE CITIES. AND EMPLOY MORE CALIFORNIANS. CAN FINALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN WE WILL SURELY DEFEAT COVE IN NINETEEN. OF THIS I HAVE NO DOUBT. BUT WE LET'S NOT FORGET THE BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC THE MOST URGENT ISSUE FACING THE STATE WAS OUR HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING CRISIS. IT WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE KOBE NINETEEN. IT'LL BE AN EVEN BIGGER ONE AFTER. LET'S CRAFTED BUDGET. AND AN ASSOCIATED STIMULUS PLAN. THAT WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THESE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. IN CLOSING I WAN TO JUST REMIND OF BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN MY COLLEAGUES AT THE LEGISLATIVE LGBT Q. CAUCUS. AS A HOST OF REQUEST THAT ARE PENDING BEFORE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. I POINT OUT THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS RESEARCH SURVIVE DEPENDENT BEFORE. WE AIM TO SURVIVE THIS ONE AGAIN BUT WE HOPE TO DO WITH THE SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THE LOUDEST DEFEAT THE LAST ONE. AND THERE ARE MANY FUNDING REQUEST PENDING. TRY I TRY TO JUST PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU CAN MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN MISTER SPEAKER. I YOUR- SURE THIS AND PUT. THANK YOU MISTER SAUCIER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE WORK THE AND OTHERS A TOGETHER KIND OF CRAFT FRAMEWORK BUT BUT I WHAT'S OF WHAT'S WHAT'S MY PRONOUNCED NOW IS THAT THE INCOME A THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE YEARS IS NOW MORE PROFOUND FELT WITH THOSE WHO DON'T DON'T HAVE SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH. IT JUST GOT OF A LOT WORSE IT YOU DON'T HAVE. IF YOU DID HAS VISION BORDER. JUST GOT A LOT WORSE IF YOU'RE DRIED UP. SO WE- WERE YOU ARE. ON THAT LOWER ECONOMIC SCALE YOUR HURT MUCH WORSE TODAY THAN YOU HAVE EVER PART. I WANT TO RAISE UP THE USUAL HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND SOME OF US HAVE MENTIONED THE MILLER- TWO BILLION DOLLAR REQUEST SOME OF US TO JUST MENTION HOMELESS AS AN ISSUE. EVEN THEN IF WE WERE TO PUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IT'S STILL LESS. OR ABOUT 1% OF THE STATE BUDGET. THIS IS ASSUMING THAT THIS IS ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE WERE MOST VULNERABLE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE RENTERS. ON THE LOWER ECONOMIC SCALE WE'VE GOT MUCH WORK TO DO FOR RENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND EVEN THOSE WHO ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY NOW. OR BEFORE OF LOSING THEIR MORTGAGE. WE TALK ABOUT THE MOST VULNERABLE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES. THE BEST A HARD TO GET WORK BEFORE. AND IF IT WAS HARD TO PAY RENT BEFORE. IT IS MUCH HARDER TODAY AND YES THEY PAY TAXES. WE'RE PROPOSING TO LET YOU KNOW CAUCUS. THAT THAT IF YOU THOUGHT THAT IF YOU HAD NINETEEN NUMBER YOUR PREPARE AND YOU FALL TAXES THAT YEAH YOU SHOULD RECEIVE ON. BENEFITS YEAH YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD EXPAND THE IDC CARE THE I CC PROGRAM. TO THOSE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. WE'VE GOT MUCH MORE WORK TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THAT'S NOT TO MENTION OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE IN MANAGE HEALTHCARE THAT WOULD DEPRIVE EVEN LA COUNTY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLIONS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS ALREADY AN ADEQUATE FOR MANY WHO THOSE. HORNS WERE IN GREAT NEED. THAT'S NOT TO MENTION THAT- DIGITAL DIVIDE. SO IF YOU'RE IN AN URBAN AREA IN DIDN'T HAVE. GOOD CONDUCTIVITY WELL NOW YOU HAVE. NO SCHOOLING IF YOU CAN'T CONNECT TO THE INTERNET IF YOU HAVE NO TABLETS. IF YOU COULD IF YOU DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE BEFORE AND IT WAS HARD. TELEHEALTH IS WANTED POTENTIAL SOLUTION. PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T SHOW UP. I TO A CLINIC TO A OSPITAL OR TO VISIT A REGULAR DOCTOR. THERE ARE SOLUTIONS ON THE TABLE THAT WE CAN TAKE. NOBODY HERE I BELIEVE ONCE DID YOU ANY CUTS. BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD ALL OF US LAMENTED THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN WITH A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. AND EVEN IF IT'S BACK BILL BY FEDERAL FUNDS WE STILL LACK. A SOCIAL MATT. WE STILL LACK THE ABILITY TO FULFILL THOSE THINGS THAT WE VERY MUCH CARE ABOUT. EVERYONE HERE STATED. THAT WE NEEDED TO PRESERVE PROGRAMS THAT WE LAMENTED CUTS. BUT THAT'S ONLY IF WE ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO AND DON'T THINK ABOUT SOLUTIONS. AND THE WAY TO INCREASE REVENUE. I DON'T THINK IT'S A SECRET THAT PAST GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES. AND COALITIONS HAVE AFTER VOTERS TO CONSIDER RAISING REVENUE VOTERS CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A THAT'S A FAIR SOLUTION. AND I DON'T I LOOK AT IT ONE OF THE 1% JUMP ON A PRIVATE JET GO TO THE LUXURY OF A TWENTY SECONDS THE QUARANTINE THE REST OF THE 99% AS HARTNETT HOME. GETTING MORE SICK AND SEEN THE NUMBERS DRIVE UP AN ILLNESS AN INFECTION RATE THE CALL THE NINETEEN. I MEAN I PUT ON THE TABLE. MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT A WEALTH TAX. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING JUSTICE COMFORTABLE TODAY. AS THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND IN FACT SOME MIGHT ARGUE THAT THEY'RE EVEN DOING BETTER TODAY. THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I THINK WE SHOULD PUT ALL THOSE THINGS ON THE TABLE. AND TALK ABOUT. HAVING THEM PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER. THANK YOU ANOTHER BEST BIGELOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT YOU AND THE VICE CHAIR I'M PUTTING TOGETHER A WONDERFUL HEARING HERE FOR US TODAY IT'S GONE A LITTLE BIT LONG BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF THE ALEJO. SIR CLEARLY TODAY WE HEARD IN OVER. WELL MAKING A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED A LOT OF GOOD COMMENTS A LOT OF CONCERNS RAISED. EACH OF THESE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS RAISED. REALLY REVOLVED WITH ONE THREAD. THE LACK OF OR THE MISSING COMPONENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF. ANY OF THE QUESTIONS IN TODAY'S PRESENTATION ON THE LAST PAGE OF YOUR DOCUMENT OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS YOU'D AT RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO PROPOSE SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES SUBMIT SEVERAL PROPOSALS SIDELINE THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY WITH THE GOVERNOR HAVING- SIDESTEPPED OR OVERSTAFFED ON NEARLY TWO HUNDRED LAWS COULD YOU ELABORATE ON YOUR COMMENT THERE REACHING ARCH. WE THINK THAT THE- PROPOSALS FOR SOME OF THE COVE IT NINETEEN RELATED SPENDING IN PARTICULAR USING THE CONTROL SECTION PROCESS. COULD BE DONE IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND AT THIS POINT- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE IF WE THINK BACK ABOUT YOU KNOW AT THE TIME WHEN THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE LEGISLATURE WAS GOING ON RECESS THAT THE THERE WAS A NEED FOR A NIMBLE RESPONSE BY THE STATE BUT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO ACT SWIFTLY AT THAT TIME TO PASS LEGISLATION AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE- GRANTS. UNUSUAL LEVEL OF DISCRETION TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW TO RE RE DIRECT FUNDS OR TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO ANYTHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED CODE RELATED FOR EXAMPLE AND SO YOU KNOW WE JUST THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD AS A BODY WOULD WANT TO REVIEW AND CONSIDER MAKING SOME AMENDMENTS TO IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR OVERSIGHT CAPACITY. THANK YOU- WITH THAT SAID COULD YOU- PLEASE OUTLINE IN WRITING WHAT SOME OF THOSE ARE IN DETAIL SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON THEM AS A BODY- IN MORE DETAIL SO THAT WE CAN DIGEST THAT AND- TAKE ACTION ON PROTECTING THOSE. MISTER CHAIR WITH RESPECT TO- THE REST OF MY COMMENTS I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR HIS ACTIONS OF PULLING TOGETHER THIS ENTIRE HEARING AS WELL. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD ALSO MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON NOT GIVING AWAY AREN'T SORTIE AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES HERE I WOULD. ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE GOVERNOR TAKING HIS ACTIONS WE DID SO AS A BODY IN THE BEGINNING. GIVE IT LIKE THE LA- SAID GIVEN THAT SAID WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE JUST AS IT WAS SAID TODAY BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE IN NEW YORK. A LOT OF BAD- DECISIONS WERE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES WERE MADE. BASED UPON THE INFORMATION THAT WAS GIVEN AT THE TIME. SO WE'VE ALL LEARNED AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS LET'S ALL AGREE THAT WE CAN ALL DO BETTER. AND WORK TOGETHER IN A L. MORE STRUCTURED WAY I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN BE MOST SUCCESSFUL- BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER REACHING AND GOING ANY FARTHER. BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT THROUGH THIS PROCESS AS WE'VE HEARD FROM EVERY SINGLE MEMBER HERE TODAY. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR THE AND IF IT BE OKAY. IF THE L. L. COULD ADDRESS. THAT RESPONSE TO THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE RATHER THAN JUST- MY COLLEAGUE THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU MISTER FALL. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THE COMMITTEE CHAIR TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS- FIRST WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO ADDRESS- THE PROPOSED TRANSFER FUNDS FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY COUNT- TO THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF ITS ATTENDED PROMISE PURPOSE THAT WAS MENTIONED BY- I NEVER MY COLLEAGUES AND SECONDLY- FUNDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL REMAINS CONSPICUOUSLY UNAFFECTED GIVING IT RECEIVED A CONTINUES ALLOCATION 25% OF CAP AND TRADE AUCTION PROCEEDS DESPITE SITTING ON A TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OR WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO HIGH SPEED RAIL REVENUES IN ORDER TO FUND EDUCATION OR HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD WITH DISTANCE LEARNING. THIS FALL I WILL SAY THAT WE MUST ADJUST OUR PRIORITIES REFLECT OUR NEEDS AT THIS TIME AND BREAKING PROMISES BY SHIFTING TRANSPORTATION FUNDS AND NOT ADJUSTING HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR REVENUES TO FUND OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS EDUCATION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND SO AS THIS WITH A MISTRESS HAS SAID TIME AND TIME AGAIN OUR BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR PRIORITIES HOWEVER IN THIS BUDGET WE I BELIEVE WE ARE NOT PUTTING OUR RESOURCES WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED MOST AND I WOULD LIKE TO. HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. YES ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THOSE MONIES THOSE CAP AND TRADE MONIES THAT ARE AT THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- THOSE ARE THOSE WILL BE SPENT ON ON COMPLETING THAT THE- THE- SECT. THE SECTION OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND THEY THE FEDERAL FUNDING- WORK THERE WAS A TIME LIMIT ON SPENDING THAT SO THAT'S THE MONEY THAT'S BEING SPENT FIRST- THERE ARE NO PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THIS BUDGET. AND THAT BUDGET WE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE IMPORTANT EVENT AT PORTENTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AS ONE WAY THAT GOVERNMENT CAN ACTUALLY SPUR AND ADD JOBS. AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS ADDED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- AND WILL CONTINUE TO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AS THE- CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES TO RAMP UP- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING NOW. SO TO STOP THAT WOULD BE REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO THAT TO THAT EFFORT THAT'S BEEN GOING ON- AND THEN I KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU HAD ANOTHER QUESTION AT THE BEGINNING THEN I GOT IT JUST LIKE THEY KNOW THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE TRANSFER. OF FILES THAT I TO THE STATE OUR ACCOUNTS OF THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT THE MONIES THAT WERE TRANSFERRED AND AGAIN. LOOKING ALL ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT AND ALL DIFFERENT AREAS FROM FUNDS THAT COULD BE BORROWED OR TRANSFERRED AND WE IN THAT AND THAT IS. NOT IDEAL- BUT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CRISIS WE THINK THAT SOME INTERNAL BORROWING AS NECESSARY. TO REALLY AVOID THE HARSHEST CUTS- IN SO THAT THAT- STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT THOSE OUR INTEREST EARNINGS AND THAT THE IDEA IS THAT THOSE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED. TO THE GENERAL FUND. IT JUST IT WAS JUST OF ART ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE THAT I'M ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE CONSTITUTION. I SEE THAT THERE'S THE SEMANTICS THERE BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE THE I MEAN I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS NO INTENT BY DEMONSTRATION TO BACK FILL ANY OF THOSE FUNDS ARE TRANSFERRED. SO THAT WOULD BE TRANSPLANT OUR TRANSFERS ARE TRANSFERS LOANS OR LOANS AND LOANS WOULD BE REPAID WITH INTEREST. SO THIS IS SO IT WOULD OPENING WOULD BE THIS ONE IS MY AND- MY UNDERSTANDING. IS INTEREST EARNINGS THAT WOULD BE. AND NOT PAID BACK AND NOT BE BACK THANK YOU. OKAY I'M NOT SEEING ANY MORE. MICROPHONES I WAS GOING TO GO TO- ARE VICE CHAIR FOR A CLOSING COMMENT ON MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT AND WILL. WE WILL.
