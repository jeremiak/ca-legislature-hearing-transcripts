NEEDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

YEAH JUST A QUICK FOLLOW U ON-

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.092
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IT

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.961
ONE THING I HAVE BEEN HEARING

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:18.461
QUITE A BIT FROM SCHOOL

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:20.897
DISTRICTS. IS I MEAN CERTAINLY

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.332
THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY WAS VERY

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:24.734
HELPFUL- BUT THERE IS THIS

00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:26.469
FEELING THAT WERE ALMOST

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:29.205
CREATING CATEGORICAL IS AGAIN.

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:32.008

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:34.210
FOR EACH GRANT. ESPECIALLY ON

00:53:34.277 --> 00:53:35.845
LIKE SMALLER DISTRICTS WHERE

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:36.513
THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.949
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IS REALLY

00:53:39.015 --> 00:53:41.051
BURDENSOME. AND THEY AND WANT

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.118
ONE SUGGESTION THAT THEY'VE MADE

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:43.753
TO ME AND I THINK MAY MAKE SENSE

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.156
IS WHY NOT JUST HAVE THIS BE ALL

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:48.525
PART OF THE L. CAP- SO IT'S KIND

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:49.893
OF ALL INCLUSIVE AND THAT YOU'RE

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.728
DOING IT ONE TIME. AND YOU'RE

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:53.430
HAVING TO DO IT FOR SEVERAL.

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:54.631
DIFFERENT THINGS CERTAINLY WANT

DEAL WITH THE THINGS- THE OTHER

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.743
THING WE'VE IDENTIFIED BUT- YOU

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.011
KNOW WE COULD BE CREATED A WHOLE

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.546
NOTHER. ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:12.315
AND PROBLEM- THAT TAKES AWAY

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:15.752
FROM. PROVIDE EDUCATION TO KIDS-

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.454
SO I THINK. THAT'S SOMETHING WE

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.122
SHOULD MAYBE THINK ABOUT I DON'T

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:20.023

ALL THE TIME AND WE'D LIKE TO

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.434
SEE MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS BE

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:34.104
IMPLEMENTED ON A FORMAL BASIS-

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.206
RATHER THAN- PUTTING DISHES IN A

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:38.475
PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE TO. APPLY

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:39.409
FOR GRANTS AND THAT IS HAPPENING

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:40.644
RIGHT NOW WITH THE EDUCATED

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.459
TO BE. CHASING DOWN GRANTS YEAH

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:57.527
THAT DOES REQUIRE SOME

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.396
LEGISLATIVE ACTION BUT WE THINK

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:00.764
THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.666
GRANTS TO BE IMPLEMENTED AWAY.

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.501
BASED ON FORMULAS BASED ON-

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:05.669

ESTIMATES BUT MOST OF THAT

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.775

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.740
POINT HERE IS THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:19.141
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY EXISTS

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.376
AROUND ATTENDANCE STUDENT

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.744
ATTENDANCE LEVELS BOTH IN THE

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.746
CURRENT YEAR. AS WELL AS WHAT

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.648
MIGHT LIE AHEAD IN TWENTY TWO

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:27.016
TWENTY THREE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.951
TO KNOW THAT EVEN IF ATTENDANCE

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:31.120
DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN EITHER

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.389
OR BOTH OF THOSE HERE IS. THAT

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:34.823
WOULD NOT RESULT IN A DROP IN

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:35.924
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:36.959
GUARANTEE YOU THOSE

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.527
CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULAS. ARE

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:39.461
STILL REQUIRED THE STATE TO

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:42.364
PROVIDE THE SAME 40% OF TOTAL

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.633
REVENUE THAT IT PROVIDES- UNDER

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.236
THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT. BUDGET

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:49.772
ESTIMATES. I SHIFTING TO PAGE

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:50.506
FIVE AND SOME OF THE SPECIFIC

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:52.107
SPENDING PROPOSALS ON THE

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:53.909
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS NEARLY

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:54.810
EIGHTEEN BILLION IN NEW

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.679
SPENDING. BY NEARLY ELEVEN

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:59.348
BILLION OF THAT IS ONGOING AND

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:00.382
MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION IS ONE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.217
TIME. WE THINK OF THOSE

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:04.153
PROPOSALS AS REALLY FALLING INTO

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:06.221
FOUR BUCKETS. THAT THERE'S FIVE

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.523
POINT THREE BILLION RELATED THE

PROGRAM AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:14.163
AGREED UPON IN LAST YEAR'S

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.231
BUDGET. OF THE PROJECT HAS FOUR

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:17.499
POINT ONE BILLION FOR COVERING

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.101
COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS AND

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.969
THE TENANTS CHANGES. THAT

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.304
INCLUDES THAT CHANGE IN HOW THE

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.605
STATE ADDRESSES DECLINING

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:27.509
ATTENDANCE AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:28.510
WILL COVER THAT IN YOUR- NEXT

BILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THE

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:33.248
LARGEST COMPONENT OF THAT IS

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:34.717
RAMPS FOR SCHOOL BUSES THERE'S

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:36.351
ALSO SOME MODIFICATION

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:38.120
INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT AT

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.389
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:41.423
FINALLY THE WE HAVE ABOUT SIX

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:45.594
BILLION- IN OTHER PROPOSALS THAT

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:46.662
DON'T FALL INTO ONE OF THOSE

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:48.764
OTHER CATEGORIES. FIVE PAGE SIX

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.199
IS JUST THE LIST OF THE MAJOR

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.000
KICKOFF PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.302
ONE TIME AND I'M GOING. TO

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:54.703
PROVIDE THE SAME LIST FOR THE

COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON PAGE

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:58.073
SEVEN. YOUR AGENDA COVERS ALL

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.109
THAT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.376
AND YOU'LL COVER THOSE SPECIFIC

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:02.311
PROPOSALS EITHER LATER IN THIS

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:06.115
HEARING. AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:07.182
ARE ONCE IN A LOT OF TIME ON

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:08.183
THAT NOW. BY TURNING TO PAGE

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.752
EIGHT. THE STATE HAS REACHED

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:11.887
IMPORTANT. MILESTONE WHERE IT

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:12.554
COULD LIKELY WHETHER A MILD

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.823
RECESSION. I WITHOUT RESORTING

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.959
TO REDUCTIONS IN K. FOURTEEN

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.660
PROGRAMS ARE PAYMENT DEFERRALS.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.662
THAT BUDGET RESILIENCE REFLECTS

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.197
THE NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.365
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.466
RESERVE NEARLY 10% OF THE

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:27.136
GUARANTEED. IT ALSO REFLECTS THE

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.437
BUDGET NOT COMMITTING ALL OF THE

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:29.705
ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.173
FUNDING TO ONGOING PROGRAMS

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.508
WHICH GIVES THE SALE OF A

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.476
QUESTION. I COULD GUESS

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:35.410
POTENTIAL DROPS IN THE GUARANTEE

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:37.746
IN THE FUTURE. AND TO GIVE YOU A

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:40.716
SENSE OF THE KIND OF. SCENARIO

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.317
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. IF I

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:43.952
PATHETICALLY STATE REVENUES WERE

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.387
TO EXPERIENCE A YEAR OVER YEAR

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:47.623
DROP ABOUT TWENTY BILLION IN

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:48.590
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THEN

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:50.292
REMAIN AT THAT LOWER LEVEL IN

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.227
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:53.729
THEN RECOVER AT TWENTY FIVE

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:54.630
TWENTY SIX. OF THE STATE COULD

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.465
LIKELY FIND AT THE GUARANTEE AND

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:57.599
GET THROUGH THOSE TWO DOWN

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:02.404
YEARS. I WITHOUT RESORTING. TO

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:03.238
REDUCTIONS IN PROGRAMS. WE THINK

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.573
IT'S OF THE ON GOING. ARE

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.842
REASONABLE ESPECIALLY FOR K.

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.377
TWELVE A LOT OF THOSE PROPOSALS

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:09.478
RELATE TO THE COST OF LIVING

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:11.580
ADJUSTMENT. OR FUNDING PREVIOUS

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:13.148
COMMITMENTS. SOME OF THE

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:15.184
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPPOSE THOSE

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.852
RAISE NEW ISSUES THAT YOU MIGHT

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:17.452
WANT TO THINK ABOUT. OF MY

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.555
COLLEAGUES WILL BE COVERING

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:20.556
THOSE AND SOME SUBSEQUENT

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:21.690
HEARING THIS. UNLIKE PREVIOUS

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:22.825
BUDGETS ARE THE STATE

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.493
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT TO THE

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.361
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THIS YEAR- THE

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:28.197
STATE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:30.232
ESTIMATES IS TWO POINT SIX

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.034
BILLION ABOVE ITS APPROPRIATION

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.769
LIMIT ACROSS TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:35.604
AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:36.772
AS YOU KNOW IN THE STATE IS

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.407
ABOVE THELIMIT IT HAS THREE

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:40.075
BASIC OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.344
THOSE EXCESS REVENUES. IT CAN

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:44.179
USE THAT AMOUNT TO LOWER TAX

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:45.781
REVENUES. IT CAN INCREASE

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.883
SPENDING ON X. ON IT ON PURPOSES

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.251
THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM THE LIMIT

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.586
LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE OR STATE

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.454
EMERGENCY IS. OREGON'S BOOK CAME

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:54.656
<i><u>UT BETWEEN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME</i></u>

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:55.324
PAYMENTS TO SCHOOLS AND

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:57.459
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND TAX

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:59.561
REBATES. AND WE BRING THIS UP

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:00.596
BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.064
AFFECTS THE KINDS OF TRADE OFFS

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.265
AND ADJUSTMENTS THAT THE

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.800
LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE THE BUDGET.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:06.535
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE TAKES

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:07.970
INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL THAT THE

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.972
GOVERNOR HAS AND JUST THAT WOULD

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.506
NOT INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING SOME

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.342
NON EXEMPT PURPOSE- THAT

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:14.710
INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF THE

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.345
STATE'S OVER THE LIMIT. AND

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:20.182
REQUIRES MORE. OF THOSE OTHER

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.917
TYPES OF CHOICES. TURNING TO

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:23.852
PAGE NINE I BE UP TO OVER

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.187
RECOMMENDATIONS TO GUIDE SOME OF

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.255
THE UPCOMING BUDGET

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:28.457
CONVERSATIONS. THE FIRST TO BE

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:29.725
DEFINED IF YOU WERE NEW

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.126
INITIATIVES THAN WHAT THE BUDGET

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.228
PROPOSES. DISTRICTS FACE SOME

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:34.563
SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:36.198
CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:38.233
PROGRAMS. THOSE INCLUDE STAFFING

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.735
DISRUPTIONS RELATED TO THE

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.169
PANDEMIC AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.338
ABOUT FUTURE INVOLVEMENT AND

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:45.073
INTEREST IN DISTRICT PROGRAMS.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.275
THAT DISTRICTS ARE ALSO WORKING

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:48.043
ON PLANS TO SPEND MORE THAN

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.278
TWENTY BILLION IN ONE TIME

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:50.746
FEDERAL FUNDS. AND IMPLEMENT

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.581
MANY OF THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:53.882
WERE INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:54.917
BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.618
WOULD ADD EVEN MORE PROGRAMS TO

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:59.221
THAT. MIX SO MUCH SO THAT WE

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:00.222
THINK DISTRICTS WOULD STRUGGLE

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:03.492
TO IMPLEMENT. ALL OF THOSE

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:04.259
PROPOSALS EFFECTIVELY. SOME

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:05.294
RELATED TO FACTORS WE'D

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.395
RECOMMEND USING UPCOMING

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:08.130
HEARINGS TO IDENTIFY AND

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:10.832
PRIORITIZE THE PROPOSALS. THAT

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:11.667
ADDRESSED MOST REALLY DEFINED

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.669
PROBLEMS. AND THAT ENTAILS

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.604
ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION BOTH

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.439
TO EXPLAIN THE UNDERLYING ISSUE.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:21.376
AND TO EXPLAIN WHY ADDITIONAL.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:22.678
FUNDING IS THE BEST BECAUSE

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.947
THAT'S THE ISSUE. AND WHETHER IT

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.581
WOULD FRAGMENTS- OR DISRUPT

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.216
EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:30.919
THAT STATE IS ALREADY. FUNDING

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.955
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE WORK FIRST

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:34.923
PROPOSALS WE SUGGEST. NOT

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.525
CREATING ANY NEW PROGRAMS IN

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.060
THAT AREA UNTIL YOU HAVE A

GREATER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:42.664

PRETTY. M. SO THE ONLY- INDICATE

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:25.453
THAT APPROXIMATELY 76% OF THE

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:30.425
RESERVES EXCEEDING THE 10% CAP

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:34.462
THAT WULD BE TRIGGERED ON THE

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:35.030
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:36.131

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:37.132

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:40.602
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT FOR TODAY

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.904
ONLY SO WOULD IT BE HELPFUL TO

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:44.272
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TEMPORARILY

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:46.775
SUSPEND THAT RESERVE CAP

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:48.610
PROVIDING ADJUSTMENT FOR

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.345
ADJUSTMENT PERIOD FOR MANY ALLEY

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:51.413
A STRUGGLING ON HOW TO

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:53.982
TRANSITION FROM ONE TIME STATE

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:57.852
AND FEDERAL FUNDS. I THINK YOU

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:00.555
SO WE'VE ASKED DISTRICTS AND OF

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.057
THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THEY

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:03.959
PLAN TO ADDRESS- THERE IS THERE

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:05.560
CALIFORNIA STANDING IS THAT MANY

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:07.896
OF THEM. MANY OF THEM INTEND TO

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:09.764
GOVERNING BOARD ACTION TO SET

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:10.532
THOSE RESERVE THE SITE FOR

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:15.003
SPECIFIC PURPOSES. I THINK- I

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.839
THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:18.473
CHALLENGE FOR THEM BECAUSE- THE

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.108
STATE HAS IN. THE PAST COUPLE

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:21.243
YEARS I THINK TRIED TO ENCOURAGE

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.445
LARGER RESERVES AT 10% RESERVE

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:25.013
FOR JUST GENERAL PURPOSES ISN'T

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.649
ALL THAT MUCH TO GET THROUGH-

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.417
SOME KIND OF ECONOMICS. COMING

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.319
DOWN TURN. US WITHOUT A VERY

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.721
LARGE QUESTION GIVEN THE AMOUNT

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:35.624
OF UNCERTAINTY THAT. DISTRICTS

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:38.326
MIGHT FACE- STORE EXPECTATIONS

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:39.527
ISN'T TAT DISTRICTS ARE GOING

01:21:39.594 --> 01:21:41.029
TO SPEND DOWN QUITE A BIT OF THE

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:43.265
RESERVES BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:44.266
SOMETHING THAT ADDS A LITTLE

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:47.102
BIT. MORE COMPLEXITY- A LOT MORE

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.169
PRESSURE ON THEM KIND OF AS PART

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:50.405
OF. THIS PART OF THE BUDGET

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:54.576
PROCESS SO- OF POTENTIALLY COULD

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.176
BE HELPFUL FOR THEM ALTHOUGH

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.279
THEY'RE FACING. THIS IS JUST ONE

01:21:57.345 --> 01:22:01.516
OF MANY AND HAVE UNIQUE- BUDGET

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.217
CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:03.885
NEXT YEAR. SO CAN YOU TELL US

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.520
HOW PROPOSITION TO DIRECT THE

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:08.356
STATE TO SPEND OR SAVE. FUTURE

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.392
FORMULA DRIVEN DEPOSIT AMOUNTS

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:14.729
THAT EXCEED THE 10% YES SO ONCE

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:16.898
THE PROPOSITION TO RESERVE THE

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.867
STATE RESERVE WE JUST 10% OF THE

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:20.468
GUARANTEED ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.337
ON A LONGER REQUIRED. WHEN IT'S

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.172
TIME TO TAKE THOSE DEPOSITS OUT

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.640
OF THE RESERVE ALLOCATE THEM TO

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.509
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:28.677
ARE SOMETIMES THE CONSTITUTION

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:29.678
REQUIRES THE THRALLS THE

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:31.279
LEGISLATURE CAN ALSO DO IT ON A

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.715
DISCRETIONARY BASIS. BUT THERE

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.484
WAS NO SPECIFIC FORMULA IN THERE

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:38.286
THAT EXPLAINS HOW THAT'S GOING

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:39.954
TO BE ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:42.157
DISTRICTS. ONE OF B. AS THE

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:44.059
HESITATION MAY BE CONCERNED THAT

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.160
HER CONTEST FIX OF THAT IT'S

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:46.461
HARD TO INCLUDE THE STATE

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:47.729
RESERVE AND I LOCAL PLANNING

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:48.630
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:49.698
HOW THE STATE'S GOING TO USE

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.366
THAT ONE WE ACTUALLY DO GET INTO

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:53.068
A DOWNTURN THAT COULD BE WE

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:55.036
ALLOCATED BASED ON A PER PUPIL

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:55.704
BASIS HAS. TO BE THE STATE DOES

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.405
SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO THAT'S

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.174
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.042
DISTRICTS WE APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.944
STATE HAS A RESERVE FOR SCHOOLS

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:06.181
BUT IT'S HARD TO- COALESCED AT

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:07.415
THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THEY

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.184
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT'S

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:13.455
GOING TO BE YOU THE. NEXT TIME

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:14.289
THE STATE ENTERS A DOWNTURN.

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:15.957
OKAY SO THE STATE CAN SEE. THIS

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:19.461
CAN SAVE OR- THE FUNDS. ARE THE

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.796
RESERVE IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:23.164
FUNDS HAVE TO BE USED TO

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:24.499
SUPPLEMENT THE PROPOSITION

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:25.333
NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE USE OF

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.370
THE STATE COULDN'T USE THAT TO.

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:30.572
LEAVE IT FOR SOME OTHER NON

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:32.374
SCHOOL NOT EDUCATION PROGRAM

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.743
ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET- IT'S

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.478
DIFFERENT THAN SAY THE BUDGET

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.179
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT FOR SOME

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.781

NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IN SOME

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:48.523
FORM. THAT WILL BE DETERMINED BY

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.760
THE LEGISLATURE THE TAXI CABINS

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:54.562
. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDING AND- WITHIN

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:47.969
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:00.782
THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:02.617
THAT ENACTMENT THAT FUNDING FOR

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.652
THIS PROGRAM WOULD REACH A FIVE

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:06.421
BILLION DOLLARS- AND A RATE FOR

01:27:06.487 --> 01:27:08.022

PER ADA- IN THAT PROGRAM AND

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:13.995
THAT THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.229
PROGRAM THAT WAS THE GREEN ALL

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:16.497
ALONG BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.967
OF THE LEGISLATURE TO- INCREASE

FUNDING OVER THE NEXT FIVE

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:21.936
YEARS. TO THAT POINT SO THAT WE

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.805
EVEN REALLY HAVE SUPPORT IN THE

ENVISIONED BETWEEN THE

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:27.675
ADMINISTRATION OF THE

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:29.944
LEGISLATURE- SO IT'S PART OF

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.312
THAT AGREEMENT AND THEN. OUR

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.648

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:43.424
PERHAPS A BIT FASTER MAYBE

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:44.392
FINISH THE ENVISIONED BUT

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:45.860

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.603
JUST QUESTION WHETHER THAT WOULD

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:56.204
PASS LEGAL TASK. BECAUSE IT'S

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.071
MONEY THAT I WOULD ARGUE IS

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:58.406
BEING DRIVEN AWAY. FROM THE

01:27:58.473 --> 01:27:59.140
CLASSROOM FOR DAYTIME

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:01.109
INSTRUCTION. AND OTHER THOSE ARE

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:03.845
GOOD PROGRAMS BUT ARGUABLY. THEY

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:04.512
COULD BE FINED WITH GENERAL FUND

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.814
MONEY AS WELL- AND YOU LOOK AT

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:07.749
THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:11.552
THAT'S WHAT. A 5% PLUS INCREASE.

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:13.054
TO THE BASE ALLOCATION ON TOP OF

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.722
A GOVERNOR'S ALREADY PROPOSED

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:16.424
FIVE POINT THREE THREE. WE COULD

01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:21.229
REALLY HAD TOWARDS. MEETING THE

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:23.097
NATIONAL AVERAGE- OF STUDENT-

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:26.668
PEOPLE FUN. SO I ADDED TO AGAIN

01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:27.769
A QUESTION- WITH REGARD TO

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:29.237
PERSON STIRS THERE'S NO

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.506

YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS THAT

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:36.377
ACCURATE ON THE ON THE EMPLOYER

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:39.881
SIDE. THAT IS CORRECT. IT IS ONE

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:41.115
OF NOTE FOR MEMBERS LIKE ME THAT

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:42.950
PUTS A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON

01:28:43.017 --> 01:28:44.686
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT MEANS THEY

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:46.454
HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE MONEY.

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:47.922
TO PAY THE PENSION BURDEN ON TOP

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.590

REQUIREMENT THAT ACTUALLY.

OF TEN PERCENT. OF RESERVES THAT

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:14.682
ACCURATE. SIR THAT THAT'S

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:16.451
ACCURATE THOUGH THE STATUTE

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.052
STATES THAT WHEN THE RESERVE

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:20.755
BALANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR IS

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:23.658
ABOUT 3% OF THE K. TWELVE SHARE

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:25.293
OF THE GUARANTEED THAT IN THE

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:26.861

I DON'T LIKE THAT PART OF- OF

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:38.306
THAT PROPOSITION PROPOSITION TWO

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:39.841
IS TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT EITHER

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:42.810
WAY IT WAS SO COULD THE

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:45.413
LEGISLATURE- THROUGH STATUTE

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.882

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.800
THE STATE MORE THAN SCHOOL

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:47.835
DISTRICTS IN OTHER WORDS STATES

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:49.871
TO HAVE HAVE A LESSEN BURDEN.

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:52.006
WITH REGARD TO THE PENSION THE

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:53.541
CARD THE PENSION COSTS OF THE

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.776
BIRD OF PENSIONS AND SCHOOL

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:59.180
DISTRICTS ACTUALLY. HAVE AN

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:00.114
INCREASED BURDEN IS THAT

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:03.251
ACCURATE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:04.619
MEMBER O'DONNELL I CAN TAKE AND

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:07.788
I SHOT IT ANSWERING THAT- THE-

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.957
STATE- AS YOU KNOW WHEN IT

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:10.892
CREATED THE CHARACTERS FUNDING

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:12.727
PLAN. ASSIGN SOME OF THE

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.795
LIABILITY TO SCHOOLS EMPLOYERS

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.931
AND SOME TO THE STATE. AND WHAT

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:18.733
MAKES THE ASSIGNMENT IN

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.001
CALCULATION OF LIABILITY SO

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.769
COMPLICATED AS IT'S NOT BASED ON

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:23.604
THE ACTUAL ASSETS AND

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.506
LIABILITIES OF THE PLAN AS IT

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:27.541
EXISTS TODAY BUT WHAT. THE PLAN

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:28.743
WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE IF THE

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:29.377
STATE HAD MADE DIFFERENT

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:31.312
DECISIONS IN THE

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:32.480
NINETEEN NINETIES AND EARLY TWO

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:33.915
THOUSANDS ABOUT BENEFITS AND

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:37.418
CONTRIBUTIONS- ONE OF THE- I

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.586
THINK PERHAPS UNINTENDED

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.354
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT APPROACH IS

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:42.757
THAT. NEARLY ALL OF THE

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:44.425
VOLATILITY AND INVESTMENT

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:47.328
RETURNS IS ASSIGNED TO THE STATE

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:49.030
AND SO WHEN INVESTMENTS DO

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:50.398
REALLY REALLY WELL LIKE THEY GET

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.934
OVER THIS PAST YEAR- THE STATE

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.502
RECEIVED NEARLY ALL OF THE

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.871
BENEFIT FROM THAT- WHEN THEY DO

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.739
VERY POORLY THE STATE'S ON THE

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:01.909
HOOK- FOR MOST OF THE INCREASED

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:04.412
COSTS. AND SO THERE IS NOT- AND

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:07.682
ABOUT A SHARING OF- OF THE GAMES

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:10.184
AND- ASSURING OF THE UPS AND

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:11.652
DOWNS IN THE SYSTEMS INVESTMENT

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:12.920
AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS THE WAY

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.889
THAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT- THE WAY

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:17.291
THE- CITY CALPERS IS STRUCTURED

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:18.592
FOR IT THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:19.560
IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.262
THE CASTERS LIABILITY IS. IS SET

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:23.831
UP. HOW WE THINK A MORE

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:24.498
STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SPLIT UP THE

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:26.334
UNFUNDED LIABILITY WOULD MAKE

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.169
THE PLAN EASIER TO MONITOR IN

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:30.137
YOUR TO UNDERSTAND. AND WHAT A

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:31.539
LIMIT SOME OF THESE ON IT

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:33.774
UNINTUITIVE AND MAY BE

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:35.676
UNINTENDED OUTCOMES WHERE THERE

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.812
IS A- FOR APPLE A BIG REALLY BIG

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:40.047
GAME INVESTMENT RETURNS. AND

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.449
THAT DOESN'T REALLY RESULT IN

01:33:41.515 --> 01:33:47.788
SCHOOL. CONTRIBUTION RATES GOING

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.123
DOWN AT ALL. SO BY. WHAT YOU'RE

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.257
SAYING IS WHEN THE- WHEN THE

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:51.525
FUND IS HOW. TO S. AND THE

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:53.327
BURDEN ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.395
RIGHT WHEN THE FUND DOES VERY

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:56.097
WELL IN THAT THE INVESTMENT

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:57.698
RETURNS THE COASTERS THIS PAST

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.767
YEAR BUT WAS UNPRECEDENTED AND

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:00.334
IT WASN'T REALLY ONLY SEVEN

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.336
POINT TWO. EXACT RIGHT IT WAS

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:04.638
RIGHT SOMETHING THAT NONE OF THE

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.007
SORT OF CENTER TO THE FAIRLY

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:07.375
CONSUMMATED THIS SYSTEM EVER

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:09.043
ACHIEVING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:11.412
WE WOULD EXPECT AND WHAT CAN

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.547
WITH CALPERS THAT RETURN ALLOWED

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:14.949
THE STATE TO REDUCE SOME OF THE

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.250
PRESSURE ON SCHOOL EMPLOYER

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.586
RATES NEXT COUPLE YARS- WITH

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:20.121
CAL STAR IS IT'S JUST THE

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:21.822
OPPOSITE IN FACT. IT'S QUITE

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:22.957
POSSIBLE THAT DISTRICT RATES

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:24.392
WILL END UP BEING A LITTLE BIT

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:29.296
HIGHER. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:29.897
THEN THE SYSTEM WAS PROJECTING

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:31.832
PREVIOUSLY. SO IF WE COULD MAYBE

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.000
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.368
AND MYSELF- THERE THERE'S A

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:37.538
THERE'S A RAMP. AND THE BURDEN

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.573
ON A DISTRICT INCREASES EVERY

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.109
COUPLE YEARS OR SO THE FINANCIAL

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:44.979
BURDEN WITH REGARD TO. TO CAL

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:46.914
STIRS. AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:49.383
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FUND HAS

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:50.184
DONE EXTREMELY WELL PARTICULARLY

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:53.254
LAST YEAR- THAT RAMP DOESN'T

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.222
EVER NOTHING READ AND NEVER

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:57.458
THERE'S NEVER. IT DOESN'T GO

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:58.826
NEVER GOES DOWN RIGHT NO YOU'RE

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:01.328
YOU'RE CAUGHT THE COST PER NEW

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:03.731
DISTRICT ALWAYS GOES UP. AT THE

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:06.267
RATE CAN GO DOWN- FOR EXAMPLE

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:10.304
CAN GO DOWN AS- PAYROLL GROWS

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:11.305
FASTER THAN THE STATE ASSUMES

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:13.441
BECAUSE- IT MEANS THAT. THOSE

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:15.009
CONTRIBUTION RATES GENERATE MORE

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:17.244
MONEY FOR THE SYSTEM BUT IT

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:20.481
DOESN'T GO DOWN BASED ON B. JUST

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.049
HAVING A VERY STRONG INVESTMENT

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.217
HERE WHICH IS THE HONEST WITH

01:35:23.284 --> 01:35:25.519
OF. PART OF THIS UNIQUE OKAY I

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:27.388
GET IT THE RATE OF RETURN

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.190
DOESN'T NECESSARILY IMPACT THE

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:30.958
BURDEN TO A DISTRICT. RIGHT OR

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:32.793
CANADA OR IT CAN IMPACT IT IN

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.261
KIND OF THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.729
YOU WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:38.732
EXPECTED TO DO. OKAY UNDERSTOOD-

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:44.371
WITH THAT THANK YOU. OKAY

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:48.175

TO THE LCF FORMULAR FORMULA-

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:08.963
BEYOND THE COLA- AND- RISING

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:10.364
PENSION COSTS AND HEALTHCARE

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:12.800
COSTS INFLATION DO WE FEEL THOSE

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.368
ARE IN MY OWN WORDS ROUGHLY

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:17.204
ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS WHAT IS

01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:19.707
NEEDED I KNOW THE CALL WAY IS-

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.575

THEY'RE ENTITLED TO- AND ALL OF

ME THE WAY THAT THE REBATE COULD

01:40:03.597 --> 01:40:04.164
BE CALCULATED AS ONCE WE HAVE

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:07.067
ACTUALS- WE WOULD ADJUST AS

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:08.102
NEEDED FOR WHATEVER THAT

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:11.472
INCREASED CALL. IS ELEAZAR WON'T

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:14.508
IN TERMS OF IMPACTING OUR

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:16.143

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.848
THEIR ETA RIGHT AS THEY WOULDN'T

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:23.851
IN IN ANY OTHER YEAR OR EVEN IF

01:40:23.917 --> 01:40:26.453
WE DIDN'T DO TO. EXPANSION THAT

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.721
LIFTING EXPENSE WILL JUST KIND

01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:29.723
OF BE ROLLED IN WITH HOW WE

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:32.493
TREAT- ON KIND OF AN ACCOUNTING

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:34.895
RECONCILIATION BAKER THE REST OF

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:37.231
THE ALTHEA SO ONCE PROP NINETY

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:39.900
EIGHT IS- PRIOR YEAR FOR EXAMPLE

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:41.835
THE ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE.

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:43.070
IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:44.938
WE'RE WORKING ON THE- THE WHAT

01:40:45.005 --> 01:40:46.974
WOULD THEN BE THE TWENTY FIVE

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.410
TWENTY SIX BUDGET. ARGUES ME THE

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:50.911
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUDGET

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:51.545
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WILL BE

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:52.846
A NUMBER ARE YOUR THAT WE

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:54.415
ACTUALLY HAVE TO CERTIFY PERCENT

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.283
STATUTE AND IT'S AT THAT POINT

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:58.419
THAT WOULD MAKE THE FINALS SAY

01:40:58.485 --> 01:40:59.920
BASED ON ACTUAL DATA THAT WE

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:00.854
WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE BY THAT

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:03.056
POINT. TO SAY WHAT WAS THE TRUE

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:05.859
COST- ASSOCIATED WITH WITH FIFTY

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.027
K. EXPANSION IN OUR FIRST YEAR

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:08.429
AND THEN WE WOULD BE BUNCHED

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:11.198
THAT GUARANTEE- BY THAT AMOUNT

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:12.399
AND THAT PERCENTAGE INCREASE

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:13.834
WHAT WOULD CARRY OUT MOVING

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.769
FORWARD- BUT AGAIN IN TERMS OF

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:17.538
IMPLEMENTATION FOR ELLIE AS

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:19.606
PREDICTABILITY THERE- BETTER. WE

01:41:19.673 --> 01:41:20.941
HAVE AN IMPACT FOR THEM BECAUSE

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:23.343
IT'S REALLY JUST MORE OF US- HOW

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.212
DO YOU THINK ON THE AGGREGATE AT

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:26.447
THE STATE WHAT WERE YOU KNOW

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:27.848
THAT THE NEW COSTS WORKS BOTH IN

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.349
THE STATE TO OR THE NEW COSTS

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:30.651
THAT THAT THE GUARANTEE IS

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:32.085
INCREASING BY. ABOUT IT SHOULD

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:33.754
HAVE BUT LIKE I SAID I READ

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:34.655
READY GOT IT SHOULD HAVE

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:36.557
PRACTICAL IMPACT RALLY I THINK

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:37.291
THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD KNOWING

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:39.626
THAT THAT THAT EIGHTY EIGHT- IS

01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:41.228
FUNDED- WITHIN THE GUARANTEED

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:43.297
AMOUNT YOU OUT. THANK YOU CAN I

BRING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:42:02.115 --> 01:42:03.917
AND WAS THE MOST- THE ESTIMATED

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:06.153
IN IN EIGHT FIVE THE ARBOR. LCSO

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:09.590
RATE FOR A- TICKET TO STUDENTS.

01:42:09.656 --> 01:42:11.658
THAT'S LIKE A BASICALLY MY- TO

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:13.894
US WE DO HAVE A LOT IT IS A LOT

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.229
OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW ABOUT.

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.096
HOW MANY STUDENTS WILL

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:17.965
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM

01:42:18.031 --> 01:42:18.899
ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST COUPLE

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.768
YEARS- G. K. IN CANADA THAT WAS

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:23.403
THE GRADE LEVEL THAT'S BEEN MOST

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.472
HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:27.941

01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:31.578
REBOUND IN COMING YEARS. AND WE

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:32.746
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:34.248
METHODOLOGY THAT'S FLEXIBLE

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:36.350
ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR- THE

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.452
ACTUAL NUMBER OF. ADDITIONAL

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:45.225
EXPANSION. I ONE ISSUE STILL NOT

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:46.426
THAT BUT I THINK WILL BE AN

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:48.095
IMPORTANT ONE IS HOW THE STATE'S

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:49.696
GOING TO COLLECT INFORMATION

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:51.532

JUST A MICROCOSM OF WHERE WE'RE

01:53:29.068 --> 01:53:30.603
AT WITH CALIFORNIA HAVING.

01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:32.505
DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:35.375
GOING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WITH

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:37.610
KOBE NINETEEN AS WELL SO THERE

01:53:37.677 --> 01:53:39.512
ARE LOTS OF IDEAS ON HOW TO

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:41.381
ADDRESS THIS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:43.416
SURE OF WHAT WE DO IS IN THE

01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:45.351
BEST. LONG TERM- PERSPECTIVE

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:47.253
CALIFORNIA KNOWING THAT WE WILL

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.622
GET PAST THIS- THIS PANDEMIC IN

01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:51.758
THE IMPACT HERE AND WE WILL HAVE

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:53.259
AS MR O'DONNELL NOTED-

01:53:53.326 --> 01:53:55.061
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SO WE'RE

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:57.030
NOT DEBATING BILLS HERE HERE

01:53:57.096 --> 01:53:59.165
TODAY. BILLS THAT ARE NOT EVEN

01:53:59.232 --> 01:54:01.267
IN THIS HOUSE BUT I DID WANT TO

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:03.603
ASK ABOUT THIS OVERALL EIGHTY

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.471
EIGHT ISSUE AND SO YOU KNOW WE

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:06.406
HEARD ABOUT THIS LAST FALL WE

01:54:06.472 --> 01:54:08.441
HAD A HEARING. WE ASKED L. A. L.

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:10.076
AND FINANCE TO COME UP WITH SOME

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:13.646
IDEAS AND SO. THE- DEPARTMENT OF

01:54:13.713 --> 01:54:16.382
FINANCE- CAME UP WITH THAT KIND

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:17.450
OF A I'M I GUESS THE MIDDLE

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:19.452
GROUND APPROACH. SO DETERMINE

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:20.553
FIRST OF ALL DEPARTMENT FRIENDS

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:21.854
CAN YOU GET MORE INTO DETAIL ON

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:24.757
HOW YOU THINK THAT THIS. ADDRESS

01:54:24.824 --> 01:54:29.495
IS- THE ISSUES THAT THAT

01:54:29.562 --> 01:54:31.364
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:32.999
ARTICULATING AND GRANTED WE WANT

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:34.033
TO DO SOMETHING THAT HELPS THE

01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:35.101
MOST AMOUNT OF SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:36.736
IS NOT JUST FOR ONE SCHOOL

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:37.971
DISTRICT THE BIGGEST SCHOOL

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:40.440
DISTRICTS SO- WALK US THROUGH

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.575
WHY WE THINK THIS IS. THE- THE

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:47.780
MOST SOUND APPROACH. CERTAINLY

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:50.783
AREA FORMA FINANCE AGAIN. SO I

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.151
THINK I WOULD NOTE SEVERAL

01:54:52.218 --> 01:54:54.053
THINGS- IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.523
ABILITY- IT THE MOST SIMILAR TO

01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:59.826
OUR- CURRENT STRUCTURE BOTH IN

01:54:59.892 --> 01:55:01.361
THE SENSE OF. OUR WORK BUT IT

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:03.263
STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO BURDEN ON

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:05.064
ON ON THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:55:05.131 --> 01:55:06.899
RIGHT- THEY ALREADY REPORT THEIR

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.801
CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR EIGHTY

01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:09.569
EIGHT AND THIS WILL JUST BE

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:11.371
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT DATA

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:13.906
ABOUT PER- MULTIPLE PRIOR YEARS.

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:15.475
WRITES ABOUT BUT ONE THING I

01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:20.346
THINK THE IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT-ABILITY AS- IN OUR FAVOR. ON THE

01:55:20.413 --> 01:55:22.815
OTHER. IS THAT IF WE WERE YOU

01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:25.451
KNOW WHAT. THE CONSIDERATION OF-

01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:26.719
MOVING TO OTHER KINDS OF FUNDING

01:55:26.786 --> 01:55:28.755
MODELS ASIDE FROM EIGHTY EIGHT-

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.657
WOULD REQUIRE A LOTOF WORK

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:33.493
AGAIN- REALLY SPEAK TO THE-

01:55:33.559 --> 01:55:35.228
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION PIECE.

01:55:35.295 --> 01:55:36.529
ANNOUNCED WITH REGARD TO THINGS

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.398
LIKE ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT EIGHTY

01:55:38.464 --> 01:55:39.599
EIGHT AT THE EXISTING STRUCTURE

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:41.200
WHEN IT COMES TO CALCULATING OUR

01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:43.136
ATTENDANCE INSTRUCTION TIME-

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:44.671
WHAT WHAT THAT IS MADE UP BY-

01:55:44.737 --> 01:55:46.005
THERE'S A WHOLE YOU KNOW BACK IN

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:47.206
ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL WITHIN

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:49.509
THE AUDIT STRUCTURE- SO I WOULD.

01:55:49.575 --> 01:55:50.877
SPEAK TO THAT IN TERMS OF THIS

01:55:50.943 --> 01:55:51.978
NOT NEEDING REALLY TAKE ANY

01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:53.646
OVERHAUL IN THAT REGARD IT WOULD

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:56.049
BE AGAIN. IMPLEMENTABLE IN THAT

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:57.350
REGARD REALLY KEEPING THE FOCUS

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:59.385
ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE

01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:00.987
IN SCHOOL KIDS ARE ATTENDING THE

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:03.756
ARE BEING SERVED- VERSUS PERHAPS

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.525
JUST BEING ENROLLED. SO THAT'S

01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:07.627
ONE THING- THE OTHER I WOULD

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:11.197
KNOW IS THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:12.532
YOU KNOW THE TRENDS THAT WERE

01:56:12.598 --> 01:56:13.366
OBSERVING BUT I MENTIONED

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:15.635
ACCEPTED EVEN PRIOR TO THE

01:56:15.702 --> 01:56:17.136
PANDEMIC AND CERTAINLY IT DOES

01:56:17.203 --> 01:56:19.272
SEEM LIKE- WE HAD PERHAPS MORE

01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:20.640
FAMILIES WITH THE STATE OR MORE

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:21.541
FAMILIES THE DIFFERENT AREAS.

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:22.775
STATE MOVED WITHIN THE STATE

01:56:22.842 --> 01:56:23.910
THEN PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE

01:56:23.976 --> 01:56:25.645
HAPPENED ABSENT THE PANDEMIC BUT

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:27.447
OVERALL THE TRENDS ARE STILL THE

01:56:27.513 --> 01:56:29.782
SAME- THE K. TWELVE POPULATION

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.684
TO KEEP ABOUT THE POPULATION. IS

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:33.786
DECLINING AND IT BUT WITH BIRTH

01:56:33.853 --> 01:56:34.821
RATES BEING WHAT THEY ARE THINGS

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:37.423
LIKE THAT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:38.591
TO BE THE CASE FOR THE

01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:40.526
FORESEEABLE FUTURE. EVEN WITH-

01:56:40.593 --> 01:56:41.894
TO TAKE SPANISH AND IT DOES SEEM

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:43.963
LIKE ON A STATEWIDE BASIS-

01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:46.099
OVERALL THAT ENROLLMENT IN K.

01:56:46.165 --> 01:56:47.567
TWELVE SCHOOLS IT'S GOING TO

01:56:47.633 --> 01:56:48.835
CONTINUE TO DECLINE. ON THE LONG

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:52.338
TERM SO I DO THINK OUR PROPOSAL-

01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:53.973
RECOGNIZES THE DIFFICULTIES BUT

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.942
ALSO RECOGNIZES THE REALITY THAT

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.410
MANY LEDS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:56:57.477 --> 01:56:59.612
FACE WHEN IT COMES TO- RIGHT

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:00.480
TIGHTENING THEIR PROGRAM

01:57:00.546 --> 01:57:02.115
OFFERINGS RIGHT FIGHTING THEIR-

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:04.016
THEIR SCHOOLS AND- YOU DON'T

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:04.817
PERSONALLY WE RECOGNIZE THESE

01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:05.718
ARE. THESE ARE DIFFICULT

01:57:05.785 --> 01:57:07.920
CONVERSATION I'M CERTAINLY- BUT

01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:10.089
CLOSING DOWN THE SCHOOL AND

01:57:10.156 --> 01:57:11.190
DECISIONS OF THAT NATURE- ARE.

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:12.558
RARELY MET WITH YOU KNOW

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:14.927
POSITIVE RECEPTIVITY BUT- IS

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:16.095
CERTAINLY IN SOME AREAS OF THE

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:18.030
STATE THOSE ARE THE KIND OF

01:57:18.097 --> 01:57:25.204
CONVERSATIONS. THAT NEED THAT IN

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:26.839
SOME CASES ARE GOING TO NEED TO

01:57:26.906 --> 01:57:27.473
BE HOT WEATHER. THIS YEAR AREN'T

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.475
YEARS- THAT'S JUST HOW OF THE

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:30.810
PUMP. THAT THAT. OF THE BEAST

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:33.413
SERVICE TO THAT X. AND START THE

01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:34.947
OUR PEOPLE REALLY. THAT RIGHT AS

01:57:35.014 --> 01:57:37.417
WELL SO IT'S ALLOW. US LANDING

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:39.452
TO SPEAK HE GOT OUT. ON THE WHEN

01:57:39.519 --> 01:57:41.120
WE DO IT HAS A THESE ARE ALL

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:43.623
DECLINE. TO GIVE L. MORE. TO AND

01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:45.124
LOOK AHEAD AND POINT. FOR WHAT

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.192
THE MOTHER COME. WHAT SOME OF

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:48.194
THOSE. IN CHOICES. NAY GONNA

01:57:48.261 --> 01:57:50.897
NEED TO BE. MAKING OUR- WE FEEL

01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:51.798
THAT OUR PROPOSAL KIND OF WALKS

01:57:51.864 --> 01:57:54.233
LINE- BY BYE PROVIDING THEM

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:55.701
SUPPORT THEY NEED. AND IN A THEM

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:58.704
TO THOSE THE DECISIONS SO I'LL

01:57:58.771 --> 01:57:59.605
BE BUYING. ANSWER THAT OKAY.

01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:04.744
JUST ONE FOLLOW UP. SO THE WE

01:58:04.811 --> 01:58:05.411
HAD OUR HEARING ON THIS AND FALL

01:58:05.478 --> 01:58:07.046
AND FROM THE FINANCES THERE AND

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:09.215
THAT TIME LAST YEAR. THE THE

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:10.116
LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:12.752
CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES AND YOU

01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:13.419
KNOW IT LARGE EDUCATION

01:58:13.486 --> 01:58:16.456
ORGANIZATION. APPROACHED US THE

01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:18.458
LEGISLATURE AND YOU WITH A

01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:19.625
DIFFERENT APPROACH AND WHAT WAS

01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:21.994
YOUR- TAKE ON THAT AS FAR AS THE

01:58:22.061 --> 01:58:26.766
ADA VERSUS ACTUAL ATTENDANCE.

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:29.068
RIGHT I THINK AT THIS POINT WE

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:30.236
STAND BEHIND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:58:30.303 --> 01:58:32.338
BUDGET PROPOSAL AND YOU KNOW I

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:40.213
KNOW THERE ARE SOME- I'LL KEEP

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.949
MY COMMENTS. NO I GET THAT BUT

01:58:43.015 --> 01:58:45.985
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE- THE-

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.253
ENROLLMENT VERSUS ACTUAL

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.288
ATTENDANCE THAT IDEA WAS

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:50.890
APPROACH TO US IN THE FALL

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:53.192
REGARDLESS OF THE BILL. SO DID

01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:55.094
WAS THAT EVALUATED AND WAS THAT

01:58:55.161 --> 01:58:55.695
CONSIDERED AS AN APPROACH AND

01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:57.997
YOU JUST THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS

01:58:58.064 --> 01:59:00.333
THE BETTER APPROACH. BUT

01:59:00.399 --> 01:59:01.167
CERTAINLY SORRY I THINK I MAY

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:02.869
HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR

01:59:02.935 --> 01:59:05.938
QUESTION- SO YEAH WE DEFINITELY.

CONSIDERED SEVERAL OPTIONS AND

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:09.342
AGAIN I THINK ALL THE REASONS I

01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:11.344
LAID OUT A PREVIOUSLY ARE ARE

01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:12.912
WHY WE REALLY LANDED ON ON OUR

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:14.080

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:15.241
CLASS SIZES WERE MUCH SMALLER IN

02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:17.810
THIS WAS MIDDLE SCHOOL- IN YOU

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:19.412

SUBSTITUTE TEACHER PARTICULAR

02:00:22.782 --> 02:00:24.250
RIGHT. IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OF

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:25.518
A ROCKY EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE

02:00:25.585 --> 02:00:28.588

CHANGED THE TONE OF THE SCHOOL

02:00:31.624 --> 02:00:34.226
DAY. HAVING THAT MANY FEWER KIDS

02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:35.394

MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND

WAS THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO

02:07:56.301 --> 02:07:57.669

TO THE BUT- IT WAS ALSO

02:12:52.431 --> 02:12:53.598
DISCUSSED BY ONE OF MY

02:12:53.665 --> 02:12:57.202
COLLEAGUES AT LEAST ONE. THAT

02:12:57.269 --> 02:13:00.339
ABSENTEEISM HAS INCREASED IN 90%

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:02.874
OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IF

02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:05.444
THIS IS TRUE THEN IT IS MUCH

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:07.312
MORE A MUCH MORE SERIOUS ISSUE

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:09.147
THAT IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST.

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:12.250
AND I WOULD SAY THAT REQUIRES

02:13:12.317 --> 02:13:15.020
MUCH MORE ATTENTION THAN IT HAS

02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:17.089
RECEIVED IN THE PAST. THAT THAT

02:13:17.155 --> 02:13:18.857
IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN ESPECIALLY

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:21.259

. TO SEE WHERE THE BIGGEST

02:13:39.344 --> 02:13:40.779
PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:42.848
WHERE WE NEED TO INVEST THE

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:45.917

FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA. SO FIRST WE

02:31:07.057 --> 02:31:08.592
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:10.027
ADOPTED THE PROPOSED FIVE

02:31:10.094 --> 02:31:10.995
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BASE

02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:13.664
AUGMENTATION WE THINK THIS IS A

02:31:13.731 --> 02:31:14.598
PRUDENT WAY DISPENSED TO

02:31:14.665 --> 02:31:15.599
INCREASE POP NINETY EIGHT

02:31:15.666 --> 02:31:17.334
FUNDING AND ADDRESS THE LOCAL

02:31:17.401 --> 02:31:19.270
COST PRESSURES- THAT HAVE BEEN.

02:31:19.336 --> 02:31:21.038
RELATED TO SPECIAL GROWING

SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS. NOW

02:31:23.140 --> 02:31:24.708
TURNING TO THE GOVERNOR'S

PROPOSAL TO MODIFY THE BASE RATE

02:31:26.343 --> 02:31:29.113
FORMULA SO IN THIS PROPOSAL

02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:30.181
WOULD CALCULATE ATTENDANCE AT

02:31:30.247 --> 02:31:31.649
THE ALLEY A LEVEL RATHER THAN

02:31:31.715 --> 02:31:33.617
THE TOP LEVEL JUST AS A REMINDER

02:31:33.684 --> 02:31:34.952
SELFIES OR SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:37.288
LOCAL PLAN AREAS ARE REGIONAL

02:31:37.354 --> 02:31:39.023
CONSORTIA OF LEDS THAT

02:31:39.089 --> 02:31:40.458
COORDINATES SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:31:40.524 --> 02:31:42.326
SERVICES. AND FUNDING WHAT'S

02:31:42.393 --> 02:31:44.495
TYPICALLY A LARGE DISTRICTS

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:46.130
ACTING AS THEIR OWN SELF THAT WE

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:47.398
THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:48.532
WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:31:48.599 --> 02:31:50.701
QUESTION TO THE SOUTHWEST AT ALL

02:31:50.768 --> 02:31:52.102
HAVE A GOOD MIX OF BOTH GROWING

02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:54.872
AND DECLINING. LIAISE SO JUST

02:31:54.939 --> 02:31:56.941
WALK A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDER

02:31:57.007 --> 02:31:58.576
CURRENT LAW A MEMBER DISTRICT

02:31:58.642 --> 02:31:59.844
WITH GROWING ATTENDANCE COULD

02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:02.213
HAVE THEIR GAINS OFFSET BY

02:32:02.279 --> 02:32:03.414
ANOTHER MEMBER DISTRICTS WITH

02:32:03.481 --> 02:32:05.916
DECLINING ATTENDANCE IN CONTRAST

02:32:05.983 --> 02:32:07.117
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALLOWS

02:32:07.184 --> 02:32:09.386
ANY ALLEY ATTENDANCE GROWTH TO

02:32:09.453 --> 02:32:11.121
ESSENTIALLY BE LOCKED IN AT THE

02:32:11.188 --> 02:32:13.624
ALLEY A LEVEL. AND THAT GROWTH

02:32:13.691 --> 02:32:14.158
WOULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL

02:32:14.225 --> 02:32:15.259
FUNDING EVEN IF THE SOFTWARE IS

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:18.496
OVERALL DECLINING ENROLLMENTS-

02:32:18.562 --> 02:32:20.898
SO NEXT WE MOVE ON TO THE

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:22.166
PROPOSED ACTIVITIES RELATED TO

02:32:22.233 --> 02:32:23.934
THE I. E. P. TEMPLATE THAT

ALTERNATE PATHWAY TO A TO

02:32:25.302 --> 02:32:27.571

INSTANCE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:32:32.543 --> 02:32:34.245
DOESN'T SPECIFY A DATE BY WHICH

THE ALTERNATE COURSE WORK OR

02:32:35.212 --> 02:32:36.914

THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO.

02:32:58.202 --> 02:32:59.303
CONSIDER SETTING X. WAS IT

02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:00.905

02:33:05.509 --> 02:33:07.511
THESE POWER. MOVING ON NEXT TO

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:09.280
THE POOL TO ALLOCATE A MAN

COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:20.858
PARTNERSHIPS ALTHOUGH SOME

02:33:20.925 --> 02:33:21.959
SELFIES ALLOCATE MENTAL HEALTH

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:24.828
FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE MEMBER AND

02:33:24.895 --> 02:33:25.996
- SOME SUPPLIES. ESPECIALLY

02:33:26.063 --> 02:33:28.065
THOSE WITH SMALLER LEDS ROUTINE

02:33:28.132 --> 02:33:30.000
AND THIS FINDING OUT THE SAMPLE

ALLEGATIONS IN THESE CASES THE

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:36.140
MEMBER ELOISE MIGHT TYPICALLY

02:33:36.206 --> 02:33:38.042
JUST BE TOO SMALL AND WOULD NOT

02:33:38.108 --> 02:33:39.276
RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:40.945

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:45.950
HOLES COULD ALSO IMPACT SCHOOL

02:33:46.016 --> 02:33:47.551
MEANT HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WHICH

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:49.286
THE STATE HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING

02:33:49.353 --> 02:33:51.455
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

02:33:51.522 --> 02:33:53.257
UNDER THESE PARTNERSHIPS IZAPA

02:33:53.324 --> 02:33:55.159
FOR EXAMPLE COULD DIRECT MENTAL

02:33:55.225 --> 02:33:57.027

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.835
THIS PROPOSAL COULD POSE SOME

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:05.669
CHALLENGES FOR THESE

02:34:05.736 --> 02:34:06.670
PARTNERSHIPS MAKING THESE

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:08.105
PROGRAMS MORE ADMINISTRATIVELY

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:09.807
BURDENSOME SINCE COUNTIES WITH

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:15.879
REDUCE TOTAL FUNDING AVAILABLE.

02:34:15.946 --> 02:34:17.982
IF AN ALLEY GATE DECIDES TO PULL

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:19.450
FUNDING FROM THE PARTNERSHIP IF

02:34:19.516 --> 02:34:20.884

THE COUNTY THE LEGISLATURE MAY

02:34:25.289 --> 02:34:26.957
