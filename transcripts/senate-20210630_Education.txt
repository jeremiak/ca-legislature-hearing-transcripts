BOB ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THANK YOU FOR BEING ON TIME HE'S GOING TO BE PRESENTING AB. TWENTY TWO PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU AB CHAIR AND MAY. FOR THE OP PRESENTE TWENTY TWO I'VE BEEN THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WE THINK THIS IS THE YEAR TO FINALLY MAKE THIS HAPPEN MAKING A PRE K. UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA. A FIRST OF ALL I THINK THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- HI WE KNOW THAT EARLY EDUCATION. IS A BIG DIFFERENCE MAKER IN MATTERS FOR THE KIDS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IMPACTS THE TRAJECTORY OF THE LIGHTS FOR SUCCESS AMONG OUR KIDS IMPROVING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. SCHOOL READINESS AS WELL AS LONG TERM ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AS WELL AND AS WELL AS ADDRESSES CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES KIDS WHO GO TO EARLY AT AND QUALITY PRE K. ARE LESS LIKELY END UP IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. HOWEVER TOO MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO FIND PRE K. IN CHILD CARE MASSIVE WAITING LISTS. AND IF YOU CAN'T OF. HAVE A SLOT TO GO SOMETIMES WE KNOW THAT PRIVATE PRE K. COST MORE THAN UC BERKELEY. SO TOO MANY FAMILIES ARE NOT BOND THE SUBSIDIZE LIST BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CALLED A TO- RICH TO BE ON THE SUBSIDIZE LIST BUT THEY'RE TOO POOR TO PAY THE TRUE AMOUNT OF PRE K. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THIS BILL AND WITH THE PACKAGE THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET AND THROUGH OTHER A BILL THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATURE WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. DO THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL AND MAKE EASY UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- THIS BILL AB TWENTY TWO WILL JUST WILL DO JUST THAT FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS GIVING EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. A FREE YEAR OF UNIVERSAL PRE K. THROUGH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AS WE CURRENTLY KNOW ONLY KIDS ARE BORN IN THE FALL GET THIS FREE YEAR OF TEEKAY. AND BY DOING THIS WE WILL EXPECT SPENDING ACCESS FOR ZERO THREE THREE FOR THE KIDS TO COOK FOR THE SLOTS pPRESCHOOL NEARLY HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS CURRENTLY SERVE FOUR YEAR OLD AND STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. WE CAN USE THOSE MONIES TO SHIFT TO SERVE MORE ZERO THREE THREE POPULATION WHICH IS HEARD INSTANTLY MOUNTS BUILT THIS COMMITTEE A FEW WEEKS AGO- THIS. IT WILL BE TO REALLY. TACKLE THE SCHOOL READINESS GAP AND CAN YOU IMAGINE THE DIFFERENCE WITH KIDS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE TWO YEARS. OF QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION BEFORE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN. AGAIN THIS BILL IS PART OF A LARGER EASY PACKAGES HERE THROUGH- THE BUDGET AND LEGISLATION- ELEMENTS OF THIS ARE EXPANDING. SLOTS THROUGH TRANSITIONAL TKA AND OUR STATE PRESCHOOL AND CHILD CARE PROGRAM OVER HALF A MILLION SLOTS. ARE SCHEDULED IN OUR IN OUR BUDGET AND THE SCOTT COMPANION LEGISLATION. AS WELL AS RATE REFORM WHICH WE KNOW IS THE PRIORITY OF YOURS- MADAM CHAIR. IT'S ACTUALLY IN OUR BUDGET RIGHT NOW THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE NOT LANDED ON THIS. SUBSEQUENT TRAILER BILL TO LOCK IN HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT- THOSE ARE ALL PART OF THE OVERALL PUZZLE TO MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. SO THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY NOT JUST MAKE SURE WE GREEN LIGHT. AT THE MAKE SURE WE DO IT WELL. FOCUSING ON IMPLEMENTATION TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS. FOR OUR KIDS FOR OUR FAMILIES FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND ALSO FOR THE EXISTING CHILD CARE SYSTEM SO WE HAVE WORKED HARD WITH THE EASY FIELD. HAVE NOT FOUND A HUNDRED PERCENT- YOU KNOW. ALIGNMENT ON ALL THE ISSUES WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE- MAJOR ISSUES TO MAKE SURE WE CAN. EXPAND A PARENT CHOICE- IF THEIR PARENTS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE TO SERVE TO. GO TO A SUBSIDIZED PROGRAM FOR THEIR FOUR YEAR OLD THEY CAN STAY IN THAT PROGRAM JUST LIKE THEY CAN DO. RIGHT NOW IF THEY'RE IN THE ELIGIBLE FOR EXISTING T. K. WE ALSO IN THIS BILL WORK TO MAKE SURE THE PRINCIPALS AND ADMINISTRATORS. HAVE APPROPRIATE TRAINING AT TO SUPPORT T. K. WE HAVE AN EVALUATION PIECE TO MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON THE OUTCOMES AND THE IMPACT ON OUR E. C. COMMUNITY. AND LASTLY ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WE'VE HEARD AS WE LAUNCH T. K. IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE IT. NOT JUST A PLANNING YEAR WE ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH. LOCAL HEAD START PROGRAMS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PROPER COMMUNICATION. AS WITH LAUNCH T. K. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE AMENDING THIS BILL NEXT CAN. TO THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WORKING WITH LOCAL PLANNING COUNCIL OTHERS. TO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO FOCUS ON. TEEKAY EXPANSION. WE ARE. COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORKING ON THIS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE SUCCESSFUL. IMPLEMENTATION BILL WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS.

ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ZERO THREE YOU CAN BE A WILL BE SERVED BY PRESCHOOL HEAD START ONE FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE BEING SERVED BY T. K. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WHICH MEANS THERE IS PLENTY OF WORK. IMPORTANT WORK FOR MEMBERSHIP IN FACT MY DISTRICT LIKE I SAID HAS A WAITING LIST FOR OUR PRESCHOOL HEAD START PROGRAMS. AB TWENTY TWO IS GOING TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG STUDENTS AND FOR MEMBERS SPECIFICALLY THE LOW RATIO WILL BENEFIT INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS NEEDS AND REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF A PARA EDUCATOR. AND THE TEACHER CLASSROOM THIS WILL ADD ON ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPERIENCED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS TO MOVE INTO A T. K. CLASSROOMS IF THEY CHOOSE OR THEY CAN CHOOSE TO STAY. IN THE PRESCHOOL OR HEAD START PROGRAM EXPANDING TO K. IS GOING TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES WE NOT ONLY SUPPORT OUR MEMBERS IN THEIR JOBS BUT WE ALSO SUPPORT STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES.

I LIVE IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND REALLY SEE THE BENEFITS OF UNIVERSAL TO CARE FOR ALL THOSE FAMILIES AS WELL. THE UNIVERSITY CARE PROGRAM WHICH WILL FILL AN EDUCATIONAL DREAM OF MINE. TO HELP CHILDREN BY GIVING NECESSARY ONE ON ONE INTERACTIONS AND ALLOW ME TO OBTAIN. A HIGHER SALARY FOR THE HARD WORK THAT IS BEING. BEING THAT. I FEEL THAT ALL TEACHERS AT ANY GRADE LEVEL DESERVE TO HAVE HIGHER PAY. I WOULD WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THOSE CHILDREN AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO FINISH SCHOOL.

NEW HAMPSHIRE SHOWING NO FURTHER LINED CUTE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR ART WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND- FIRST VIA. FREESHEET THE OUTFITTERS- TAKING THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE- I THINK IT'S LIKE A QUESTION IS THAT- YOU KNOW WITH HER HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT- WHAT MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM I'M NOT SURE I SEE IN THIS BILL HOW THIS PREVENTS THAT IT'S NOT MANDATORY RIGHT- BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT- BUT I GUESS THE OTHER ISSUE IS ALSO- YOU KNOW WE TALK EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT MAKES DELIVERY AND SO FORTH AND WE HEARD EVEN SOME OF THE- PROPONENTS TALK ABOUT- WELL WITH FINANCING SO. I KNOW THAT YOU ALSO HAVE TO THE CHAIR THE EDUCATION SUB COMMITTEE FOR BUDGET AND SIMPLY CAN YOU TO SPEAK TO ME ABOUT- HOW THIS FITS INTO THE OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET- IN TERMS OF THE C. E. AND- ALSO- HOW DOES THIS THE THAT AND PERHAPS ADDRESS OPPONENTS CONCERNS ABOUT- MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR QUITE WAY THEY'D BE CONCERNED OF WHAT YOUR SPOTS THAT ON WHAT WHAT A CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WHEN. LEAST FROM I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL DOESN'T MANDATE SOMEONE DAVID STILL HAVE A CHOICE RIGHT. SO PERHAPS YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE POINTS. THANK YOU I THINKTHOSE ARE THE KEY IS. AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND SO WE'RE HEARINGS TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL WRAP THIS UP AND HAVE A TRAILER BILL HEARN IN THE COMING DAYS BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY. SO FIRST ON THE POLICY ISSUES. FOR CHANGES HEART CHANGING THE TRADITIONAL ORDER OF THINGS IS COMPLICATED A LOT OF THIS IS BUILT UPON TRUST. RIGHT THIS IS A PACKAGE OF THINK SO IF AB TWENTY TWO WAS JUST SOLO. WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH YOU SEE HI I PACKED I READILY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT BY THE FACT THAT WE'RE DRAMATICALLY INCREASING SLOTS BY. YOU KNOW THIS AND CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL SLOTS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW. PUBLICLY FUNDED SLOTS. AND THE RATE IT BOB STRUCTURE. BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM AS WELL AS GIVES COMMITTEE IS. HEARD BEFORE ANOTHER BILLS. IT THAT THE PROGRAMS AREN'T FINANCIALLY VIABLE- THE WORK FIRST IT DOES NOT ARE NOT PAID LIVING WAGES SO. THAT WE THINK THIS IS PART OF AN OVERALL PACKAGE- GETS THEBUDGET A SECOND. BUT AS FAR AS NEXT DELIVERY YOU KNOW WE THINK IT'S STILL THERE IS THAT AS YOU SAID IF AND IF A CHILD A FAMILY. IS INCOME ELIGIBLE TODAY. THEY CAN SEE WHAT THIS DO THEY CAN STILL DO TO. A CENTER BASED PROGRAM AS A FOIL THEY GONNA FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME THEY CAN THAT THEY CAN CURRENTLY DO THAT AND WE'VE WE'RE CLARIFYING THAT. IN THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT'S THE CASE. FURTHER THAT WE HAVE NEXT DELIVERY FOR ZERO THREE THREE SEVEN AND THIS. BY THE FACT THAT WE ALL OF US IN A MORE KIDS IN THE ALLEY EIGHT SYSTEM THROUGH STATE THIRTY THREE T. K. THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CURRENT KIDS IN STATE PRESCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT WE CAN MOVE THOSE TO SERVE THREE THREE THREE SO THAT IS A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM. PLUS FURTHER THROUGH THE BUDGET AND THE COMPANION BILL SB FIFTY. THERE'S GOING TO BE WRAPPED AROUND THESE PROVIDERS CANCER OF THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT ARE ANTI K. SO WE THINK THERE ARE MULTIPLE. WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AS FAR AS- THE BUDGET. WITH THE WEEK WE VOTED ON THE BUDGET AS YOU KNOW A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND WE DID HAVE MONEY IN THEIR- TAX IRONICALLY TO PAY FOR RATE INCREASES BUT NOT FOR TEA CAKE IS TK'S AND- OUT YEAR. EXPENDITURE THIS JUST THE START WE WERE JUST AUTHORIZE IT. BUT THIS LOOMING TRAILER BILL WHICH WERE STILL NEGOTIATING THE SPEAKER IN THE PROTON. THIS IS OUR TOP PRIORITY. THERE ARE YOU KNOW ARE MESSING WITH THE GOVERNOR AS WE SPEAK- IT WILL HAVE IN THERE. THE RAY. AND WHICH WE CURRENTLY FIND OBJECT TO INCREASE THAT THE EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENTILE AND DRAMATIC OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN RATE INCREASES. AND WE HAVE. OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW. CHILD CARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS SO. WE HAVE THESE COMPONENTS IN THERE. AND THE YOU KNOW I THINK BY THE TIME THIS BILL IS HEARD APPROPRIATIONS EARLIER IN THE SUMMER. SO I'LL BE A RESULT BUT A LOT OF THIS IS BASED UPON TRUST AND LASTLY. A BIG PART OF THE BILL AND WE'RE IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND MAKE WE CAN BE. A RISING BUT FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INVESTING FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR LITTLE SKITS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH PRIOR GOVERNORS THIS WASN'T AN OPPORTUNITY. SO THE FACT THAT WE'RE- TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO. A MASSIVE INVESTMENT AND RE HAULING ARE YOU SEE PROGRAM. IS I THINK HALF THE BATTLE THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT- ANSWER AND I WOULD ALSO BIG NOTE DIE UNDERSTAND THIS BILL IF IT PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL. THEN GO TO HUMAN SERVICES FOR FURTHER VETTING- AS WELL SO. OKAY THANK YOU JIM SO VERY MUCH. THE CENTER PAN OTHER QUESTION COM CONCERNS. OKAY WELL I HAVE A COUPLE ARM COMMENTS- CENTER TO SUMMER MCCARTY I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING ALL OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE ALL OF THE ALL OUR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I DO HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE IF WE DO NOT DO RATE REFORM WHICH I CONTINUE TO BE APPALLED THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE BUDGET AFTER THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WERE OPEN. THE ENTIRE TIME DURING THE PANDEMIC CARING FOR OUR WORK MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHICH ARE OUR CHILDREN IT WAS NOT IN THE BUDGET WE ARE WORKING ON IT. BUT IT. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN SHOULD BE THE LAST THING WE'RE WORKING ON GREAT REFORM IS THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON BECAUSE THAT COVERS MOST OF OUR CHILDREN BACK IT'S WORKING MOMS BACK TO WORK. WE KNOW THAT WE LOST THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED CHILD CARE CENTERS DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE COMING BACK IF WE DON'T DO RATE REFORM YES I AGREE WITH YOU SOME REFORM HAS BEEN DONE BUT THAT'S FOR THE- WORKERS WHO ARE ORGANIZED THAT ONLY COVERS 20% OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SLOTS MY NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN YOURS I THINK FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND I THINK YOU'RE CONFLATING THAT WITH. THE T. K. SLOTS TRUE FOUGHT. OR THE FOURTH OR FOURTH GRADER FOR CHILD CARE THERE ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND IN THE BUDGET MOVING TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER THREE YEARS. AND JUST TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE I AT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT JUST IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND L. A. COUNTY THERE IS A NEED OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS. SO WE KNOW THAT OVER THREE YEARS OF TWO HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND SLOTS. WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN AND OF WORKING PARENTS. SO I JUST REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE NOT PRIORITIZING SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HELP OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. I THINK BACK WHEN MY GIRLS WERE LITTLE I. WENT BACK TO WORK WHEN THEY WERE TWO YEARS OLD. TRANSITIONAL WILL NOT HELP ME I WOULD HAVE STAY HOME FOR TWO MORE YEARS. WAITING FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IF THERE WAS NOT HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO ME AND MY CHILDREN. SO LIKE I SAID I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. WE WILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET TO A POINT IN THIS BUDGET WHERE WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THE WOMEN. THAT TOOK CARE OF OUR CHILDREN DURING THE PANDEMIC. SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. AT THANK YOU FOR THE- FOR THE DIALOGUE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I KNOW WE HAVE. BIPARTISAN AND STRONG INTEREST IN MAKING SURE WE DO IT RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT BACK AND FORTH AND- I'M COMMITTED. JUST LIKE YOU TO MAKING SURE THIS IS A WIN WIN WIN FOR THE KIDS AND FAMILIES OF CALIFORNIA ASKEY RIVAL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBERS TO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN HAS MOVED THE BILL. THE TWENTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES. SENATOR LEYVA. LEYVA AYE OCHO A BUG. A TROUBLED NOT VOTING CORTESE ALL RIGHT COURTESY I DALY. DALY NOT VOTING GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN HI CAN I. LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU AND MISTER MCCARTY. WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT BILL AND THAT IS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA A. B. THREE EIGHTY EIGHT. WE GET IT ALL CLEANED UP PLEASE PROCEED- AND. AND. AND WELCOME. WELCOME THANK YOU. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A. B. THREE EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH IS A MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE NON ADMINISTRATIVE EDUCATION EMPLOYEES SERVING IN POSITIONS REQUIRING CERTIFICATION WILL BECOME PERMANENT EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING A PROBATIONARY PERIOD. TODAY EXPERIENCE EDUCATORS IN SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE BEING DISMISSED. AND TERMINATED FOR ARBITRATING ARBITRARY REASONS WITHOUT WARNING. UNDER CURRENT LAW ONLY CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES AND TEACHING POSITIONS AT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WITH AN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PUPILS CAN ACHIEVE PERMANENT STATUS AFTER PROBATIONARY PERIOD. THIS MEANS THAT CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES IN NON TEACHING POSITIONS DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ATTAIN PERMANENT STATUS. THIS POLICY AFFECTS GROUPS OF CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES SUCH AS SCHOOL NURSES ENGLISH LANGUAGE EDUCATORS FOSTER YOUTH COUNSELORS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WORKING WITH SEVERELY DISABLED STUDENTS AMONG OTHERS. IN THE CASE OF A DISMISSAL PERMANENT EMPLOYEE STATUS WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO REQUEST A HEARING BEFORE A COMMISSION ON PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS. THIS DISMISSAL WAS APPROPRIATE FURTHER A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE HAS A RIGHT TO REQUEST A HEARING DURING A REDUCTION IN FORCE. UNFORTUNATELY SEVERAL CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATE INAPPROPRIATELY DENIED PERMANENT STATUS BASED ON THE NEED TO CREATE FISCAL SOLVENCY. OR IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE NEEDS FOR SERVICES IN THE FUTURE ARE IN SECURE. THIS LACK OF PERMANENT STATUS IS LEAD TO DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION AND FAVORITISM WITHIN OUR SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS BILL WILL REMEDY THE SITUATION TREATING ALL CERTIFICATED EDUCATION EMPLOYEES WITH DIGNITY RESPECT AND THE PROFESSIONALISM THAT THEY DESERVE. WITNESSES TODAY ARE TWO ADULT EDUCATION TEACHERS ELIZABETH KITCHEN AND MATTHEW COKE. NEW THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALRIGHT WE'LL GO TO YOUR LEAD SUPPORT ON THIS KITCHEN AND MR COGAN YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES MISS KITTIN PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ELIZABETH CATCHING AND I TEACH ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE FOR EVANS ADULT SCHOOL I HAVE BEEN TEACHING ESL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I WAS LAID OFF NOT BECAUSE OF MY PERFORMANCE BUT BECAUSE OF WORRIES ABOUT THE BUDGET. THEN SOMEHOW MONEY WAS FOUND AND I WAS RE HIRED. ABOUT ONE THIRD OF US IN ADULT EDUCATION ARE PERPETUALLY TEMPORARY. REGARDLESS OF OUR PERFORMANCE WE HAVE NO PATH TO PERMANENT STATUS. WE ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM ANY OTHER TEACHERS IN THE STATE OR THE COUNTRY. SO WHY DO WE PUT UP WITH IT. MANY OF US HAVE MASTERS DEGREES AND COULD TEACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN OUR STUDENTS AND WE BELIEVE AND WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER THEM. IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A YOUNG MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR CAME INTO MY LEVEL FIVE CLASS. HE HAD ALMOST BEEN KILLED IN A TERRIBLE MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT. I SUGGESTED HE ENROLL IN COMPUTER CLASS AT THE SAME TIME AS ESL. THE PAST LEVEL FIVE AND WHEN HE SHOWED UP IN MY GYM CLASS IN LEVEL SIX IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY HE TOLD ME HE WAS TAKING THE NEXT LEVEL OF COMPUTER CLASS. AND LEARNING PROGRAMMING. I AM SO PROUD OF THIS YOUNG MAN. I FEEL HONORED TO BE HIS TEACHER. BUT I'M ALSO PROUD OF OUR PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE ENGLISH AND AFFORDABLE JOB TRAINING. WHERE ELSE COULD HE LEARN SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND SUPPORT HIMSELF. MANY OF US ARE TROUBLED AS WE WATCHED THE GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE VERY RICH AND THE VERY POOR IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE FEEL HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AN ADULT EDUCATION WE ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. FOR PROVIDING LOW COST OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO IMPROVE THEIR LIFE AND WORK THEIR WAY OUT OF POVERTY. I BELIEVE IN MY STUDENTS AND I BELIEVE IN OUR PROGRAMS. NEAT ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT MY EMPLOYER DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ME DOES NOT VALUE ME AND DOES NOT GIVE ME JOB SECURITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MR COGAN YOUR UP NEXT YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATTHEW COGAN I'VE BEEN AN ESL TEACHER WHO TWENTY YEARS AND HAVEN'T COMMITTED TO HELP SCHOOL- IN THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

THE NATION'S EXPERIENCING THE BIGGEST WAVE OF RETIREMENTS HAVEN'T THE AVERAGE AGE OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATIONAL COURSES FORTY FIVE ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION. 20% OF CARE TEACHERS ARE FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER. LET ME BE EMPHATIC WHEN I ANSWERED THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF CTE TEACHERS ACROSS SUBJECT AREAS AND- THAT'S CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO ENACT POLICIES THAT EXPAND C. P. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO ENSURE. THAT THERE ARE CAREER PATHWAYS FOR TRAINING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. AB THREE EIGHT EIGHT PROPOSAL A FIX IN THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO STRENGTHEN CAREER PATHWAYS. SPECIFIC CLASS C. AN ADULT THAT TEACHERS. AB THREE EIGHT EIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE THE AUTHORITY OF ISTRICTS HAVE UNDER EDUCATION CODE FOUR FOUR NINE FOUR NINE TO DEVELOP PLANS TO EVALUATE THEIR WORK FORCE NEEDS AND MAKE DECISIONS MAY OFFER PROBATIONARY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY CERTIFICATE EMPLOYEES. FURTHER EDUCATION CODE LOCAL NINE FIVE FIVE. HE'S SERVING K. TWELVE CERTIFICATE- PERSONNEL CLEARLY ALLOWS THE ANNUAL LAYOFFS PROBATIONARY INCOME AND PERMANENT CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES AB THREE EIGHT EIGHT WILL NOT ALTER THAT. AB THREE EIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE TIMELINE FOR MAKING DECISIONS CONCERNING PERSONNEL CHANGES IN MY HOUSE AB THREE EIGHT EIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE THE AUTHORITY THE DISTRICTS HAVE CONSTRAINED LAOS. FOR PARTICULAR KINDS OF SERVICES SERVICE SO IN THE CASE WHERE CERTAIN COURSES NO LONGER FIT IN THE DISTRICTS OF THE CPA PLAN DISTRICTS HAMPTON TENURE TO LAY OFF CERTIFICATE EMPLOYEES WHOSE INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED.

MY NAME IS JULIE DUNCAN AND I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TRI VALLEY REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAM WHICH SERVES THE DEADLINE BUT MORE VALLEY JOINT. CUSTODY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'M HERE TODAY TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE EIGHT EIGHT AND THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON OUR- KEY PROGRAMS SUCH AS TRI VALLEY. I AM NOT HERE TO A POINT OPPOSE OUR TEACHERS HAVING ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS NO WAY OUT PROCESS. HOWEVER THIS BILL WILL CREATE HUGE HURDLES THAT WILL PLACE AN IMPOSSIBLE BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS THAT WERE FORCED TO IMPLEMENT LAYOFFS THAT RELIANCE. DORY AS THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION. RATHER THAN SUCCESSFUL INNOVATIVE AND INDUSTRY RELEVANT PATHWAYS EACH EACH. CURRENT STATURE ALLOWED OUR PEACE TO ADAPT TO THE RCD PATHWAYS ALWAYS THE CURRENT RELEVANT TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. INDUSTRY CHANGES AFFECT WHAT COURSES ARE OFFERED OR NOT OFFERED BASED ON LOCAL WORKFORCE THE- FOR THIS REASON MY STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO. CLASSIFIED JIM VIDEO GAME IN OUR DESIGN SPORTS MEDICINE AND CYBER SECURITY. IMPLEMENTING INTO YOUR SENIORITY BASED LAYOFFS WOULD FORCE US TO RETAIN TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY NOT HAVE LABOR MARKET DEMAND. OR FOR WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROPER EXPERTISE IN TRAINING BECAUSE OF THE WAY ETT CREDENTIALS ARE STRUCTURE. AS AN EXAMPLE A TEACHER IN DENTISTRY HAS THE EXACT SAME THING TO CREATE CREDENTIAL AND HELP FIND. AS A TEACHER TEACHER SPORTS MEDICINE. BUT IF I NEED TO IMPLEMENT A LAY OUT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ME TO LAY OUT BASED ON SENIORITY AND NOT THE COURTS TO HAVE THE GREATER. INDUSTRY DEMAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME CREDENTIALS. ARE- HE'S ALSO DO NOT HAVE STABLE. DEDICATED FUNDING WITH THE ELIMINATION OF CATEGORICAL FUNDING OUR OF PEAS RELY YEAR TO YEAR ON COMPETITIVE GRANT. SUCH AS THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT CASE TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE GRANT. BOTH GRANT SUPPLEMENT OUR FUNDING BUT DO NOT COVER A FRACTION OF OUR CAR. AND AGAIN OUR FUNDING IS COMPETITIVE AND NOT GUARANTEED. OUR REMAINING FUNDS OPERATE ARE DEPENDENT YEAR TO YEAR UPON OUR MEMBER DISTRICTS LOCAL DECISION. NOW MORE THAN EVER OUR OPD TO RETAIN THE CURRENT LAW THAT GOVERNS OUR PROGRAM. FOR THESE REASONS PLEASE CONSIDER THE IMPACT EIGHTY THREE EIGHT EIGHT WHAT HAPPENED R. P. PROGRAM.

BASED PEOPLE CALLING IN BUT THE RULE I'M IS GONNA IMPACT FORTY FOUR. SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY IN MY AREA AND WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE- IN. THE ABILITY TO NOT BE ABLE TO BE FLEXIBLE. I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO IMPACT OUR OUR SCHOOLS. AND DISADVANTAGED THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR CALIFORNIA DOESN'T REALLY WORK. IN VERY ABOUT AND- JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE THE GRADUATING. THE- OF THE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE MY SONS. AND DAUGHTER WENT TO SCHOOL IS. FIFTY THREE STUDENTS. TO TRY TO. WE GIVE THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED THEY HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE AND SO I DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL IS GOING TO- ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT WOULD WORK. FOR THEM NUMBER THAT WITHOUT THE PROPER FUNDING TO. SECURE IT- MISTER DALI I- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT AND- AND POINTING OUT- THE CHALLENGES TO TWO SMALL A DISTRICTS. AND SO I UNDERSTAND THAT CHALLENGE LA- VERY MUCH. THAT AT THE SAME TIME IF I MAY. UM JUST EXPAND A LITTLE BIT AND MAYBE WE CAN YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO DISCUSS- WE DID HEAR. FROM TEACHERS I WANT TO THANK THOSE TEACHERS WHO TOOK THE TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY- TO SPEAK. ON BEHALF OF THE BILL IN NOW AND I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY. A MISTER DARLING. SENATOR FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AT THE CHALLENGES TO TOO SMALL. A DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT TO THE TEACHERS THAT CAME THIS MORNING- THE TEACHERS LIKE- ELIZABETH KITCHING MATIC COGAN. AND THE MANY TEACHERS WE HEARD FROM. I ALSO WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER LET THIRTY FOUR YEARS IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM. AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL- FEEL A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO THE TEACHERS IN THIS PAST YEAR- WHO WHO WERE IN THE CLASSROOM OR WERE TEACHING AT DISTANCE LEARNING. AND THE- VERY- CHALLENGING JOB THAT THEY DID AND EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN- AND WE SAY OFTEN THAT THAT THAT WE RESPECT TEACHERS YOU KNOW WE OFTEN SAY- AND THEN WE SAY THAT WE RESPECT TEACHERS AND THE JOB THAT THEY DO WE HEARD FROM ADULT EDUCATION TEACHERS ESL TEACHERS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE TEACHERS I HAPPEN TO HAVE TAUGHT BOTH THOSE SUBJECTS. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A TEACHER WHO GOES AND GOES TO- TEACH ADULTS TEACH ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE WORKING WITH WORKING ADULTS WHO'VE WORKED THE WHOLE DAY AND THEN COME BACK- AFTER HAVING WORKED THE WHOLE DAY TO TRY TO IMPROVE AND LEARN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NONE OF THOSE TEACHERS LIKE MYSELF WE'RE DOING THAT. FOR THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE PAID. THE AND IF WE GO BACK A FEW YEARS WHEN WE WERE IN LOW BUDGET- TIMES. AND ALL TEACHERS ARE MANY TEACHERS WERE GETTING WHAT THEY CALLED PINK SLIPS. BECAUSE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LAID OFF. AND THEY WERE YOU KNOW HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO WERE GIVEN THOSE PINK SLIPS. ALONE AROUND THE TEACHERS FELT DURING THOSE YEARS BUT HERE YOU HAVE A GROUP OF TEACHERS WHO ARE. EVERY YEAR IN THAT SAME SITUATION WE HEARD FROM THOSE TEACHERS WHO WHO MAY HAVE BEEN TEACHING. YOU KNOW. TEN YEARS FOURTEEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS AND NEVER GET PERMANENT STATUS SO I DON'T WANT TO. DIMINISH YOUR CONCERN CENTER DOLLY. ON SMALLER DISTRICTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DO THINK THAT IT IS- AND- YOU KNOW I'M JUST A FULL JUSTIFIABLE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN WHERE WE ALLOW. TEACHERS TO TEACH WRAPS THE ROLE WORKING LIVES AND BECAUSE OF THE IF THE- WHERE THEY ARE TEACHING AND WHAT SUBJECT THEY ARE TEACHING THEY NEVER GET PERMANENT STATUS SO THAT THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED THIS BILL. TO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM THE TEACHERS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION STILL HAS TO RUN THE SCHOOL AND START TO PROVIDE THE CLASSES IN THE IN THE ABILITY BILL TO AND WHEN YOU HAVE A VERY SMALL. RULE SCHOOL DISTRICT IT HAS ALL THESE MANDATES THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET. THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY AT SOME POINT THERE'S NO THIS IS TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY HAVE FLEXIBILITY I'M NOT DISCOUNTING THAT. LARGE SCHOOLS SCHOOLS CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE STUDENTS MORE ADA BUT WHEN YOU'RE- IT. REPRESENTING UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF VERY SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE. THE STUDENTS WITH A BROAD. AMOUNT OF MANDATES IT'S THIS THIS BILL IS GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHY THERE IS. A CAR ABOUT- THERE IS HOPE. BILITY TO HAVE THIS. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR LESS NOT IN THAT SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT YOU NEED WITHIN THE BUDGET THAT THEY ARE. TRYING TO BALANCE AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP THE SITUATION I THINK IT'S GONNA MAKE IT WORSE WHEN THEY HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THOSE COURSES. MORE THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE WHEN THEY'RE LOCKING WHEN WE'RE LOCKING THEM INTO. NEP THAT THEY THEN HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE AND THAT'S THAT'S THE PART THAT. IS THE FRUSTRATION FOR ME ON MANY ISSUES IN GOVERNMENT IS THAT WE SEE THAT. WE JUST BLANKET LEE COVER AND WE DON'T DIG INTO THE FACT THAT THERE'S A ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO PROVIDE THE ALL THESE MANDATES AND IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT ON SEVERAL LEVELS. ESPECIALLY FOR SCHOOLS WHERE THEY'RE AT A IS VERY LOW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AND THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO MEET. THE HI TERRY THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET SO FOR I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I'M HOPEFUL. THAT THERE IS SOME SOLUTION THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE WHERE YOU HAVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS I DID NOT HEAR THOSE PEOPLE COMING FROM OUR DISTRICT I HEARD IT COMING FROM VRY POPULATED AREAS. THAT HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS IN THOSE AREAS SO FOR THE VERY EXTREME RULE. IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. SOMETIMES DON'T EVEN HAVE THE- FOLKS THAT. ARE EDUCATED TO BE EVEN WHICH TEACHES CLASSES TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I APPRECIATE SEEING YOU AND I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR SOME OF YOUR OTHER BILLS TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY AND- MADAM CHAIR IF I MIGHT YES- I WOULD- PLEDGE. MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD WE MAY HAVE MORE DISCUSSION. ON THE EFFECTS OF SMALL DISTRICTS- YOU YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT WE CAN WE CAN CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THAT. THANK ANY CENTER PAM. THANK YOU AND- SUMMER MEDINA I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DID NOTE THAT- YOU KNOWHE'LL TALK ABOUT RETENTION AND- OF COURSE THIS BILL THIS. DRESS IS A RETENTION WHICH IS TRYING TO HOW DO YOU RETAIN HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS BUT THERE'S ONE ISSUE THAT'S BROUGHT BY OPPOSITION IS HOPING THAT YOU COULD PERHAPS ADDRESS. SO REALLY SOME OF THE COURSES LIKE FEELS THE LEARNING IT WAS NOTED THAT- THEY NEEDED TO TRY TO MEET THE DEMAND- SO THOSE I THINK THE TESTIMONY. WAS ABOUT WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE A- NO WAY OUT ONE COURSE THAT FOR INTO SKI AND I WITH THE EXAM SORTS WORDS MATTER. VERSE ABOUT THE THING ANY BUT THE AND DAY AND SO THEY SAID PROBLEM WOULD BE IF WE DECIDED SOLELY BY SENIORITY. WE MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO RETAIN THE PERSON TO ACTUALLY TO TEACH THE- SUBJECT MATTER THAT WAS MORE IN DEMAND BECAUSE THE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTER SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A SIX CURRICULUM. BUT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO. MEET THE NEEDS OF ADULT LEARNERS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO. HE PERHAPS JUST SPEAK TO- SO I ACTUALLY AGREE THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO TRY TO GET. THESE TEACHERS OFF PROBATION AND ONTO THEIR PERMANENT STATUS. BUT CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THE- HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AT OUR- MARK COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION WHATEVER TO RUNNING THESE ROGRAMS PARTICULARLY THESE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS- HOW THIS WOULD WORK IN TERMS OF- REDRESSING. THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE- SO BE ABLE TO RETAIN THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY OF SKILL SETS TO TEACH OUR- THE TO SUBJECT MATTERS. THE KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER SO THAT THEY WOULD NEED. MURSI'S DISHES AROUND SENIORITY LET. THANK YOU- CENTER PAN FOR THE QUESTION. AND- I WAS A SCHOOL MEMBER KATE. SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUST. AND WELL I UNDER THE CHALLENGE. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES SCHOOL DISTRICTS ROOM- ALSO- YOU KNOW MAKE THE ARGUMENT- THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING WHAT PERTAINS TO TEACHERS BECAUSE OF X. Y. AND Z. ROOM AND SO- EVEN AS AS SENATOR DOLLY SAID YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- I WOULD EXPECT. AND I THINK WE HEARD FROM- FROM MATTHEW KOGAN THAT THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS BILL WOULD YOU KNOW NOT ALLOW A TEACHER TO BE RELEASED IF- THEIR COURSE WAS NOT GOING TO BE BE OFFERED- AND DOES THAT JUSTIFY- NOT GIVING A PERMANENT STATUS TO ALL THE TEACHERS KNEW SO I GUESS I'D SAY IS THAT IT'S AGAIN I SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD GET READY JUST PROCESS. IT AND I THINK IT'S- AND SO I ALSO PUT THE BILL TO BUT- UPPER- YOUR YOUR OFFICE COULD HELP CLARIFY. HOW SCHOOL. DISTRICT ARE SOPHISTICATION WOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE AND- GIVEN THAT AND- AND BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE STAFF THAT WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TEACH THOSE SUBJECTS- IN IN THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE. UNFORTUNATELY HOPEFULLY WE NEVER HAVE TO DO THAT WE KNOW THAT FORTY DOES HAPPEN THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN YOUR- WORK FOR SO- SO THE PROVISION HONORED ALL OF THAT THANK YOU. LOW ARTIFICIALLY DUNCAN I WAS THE ONE SPOKE TO THE- SUPPORT THAT EXAMPLE IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ANSWER THAT I COULD DO THAT FOR YOU. WELL I DID DIRECT THE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL BUT I. AM ACTUALLY I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP A LITTLE BIT FROM TO YOUR POINT SENATE ALL THE ABOUT THE MONEY- THIS YEAR IN THIS BUDGET LCF THE FUNDING IS GOING IS. THROUGH THE ROOF SO THERE WILL BE MORE MONEY. EVERY DISTRICT BIG OR SMALL SO I THINK THAT GOES TO PART OF YOUR ISSUE HOPE MAYBE THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT. AND TO YOUR POINT- CENTER PAN CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS. FOR LAYOFFS BASED ON OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN SENIORITY SUCH AS PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS SO SENIORITY CERTAINLY COULD BE CONSIDERED BUT IT IS NOT THE SOLE FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER SOMEONE SHOULD BE LAID OFF I HOPE MAYBE THAT HELPS BOTH OF YOU A LITTLE BIT. NINE NINE MAY THOUGH YES THEY DO YEARS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THIS. WILL STILL BE IN EFFECT THAT'S THAT'S MY- THAT IS CORRECT BUT YOU COMPLAIN. WHEN YOU MONEY TO FOR. ALL THE LONG BUT IF. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE A BUDGET CRUNCH LOOK AT THIS YEAR. MORE MONEY THAN EVER BUT- A FEW YEARS NOW WILL BE THAT SITUATION THEY'LL BE STUCK WITH THIS. LAW NOT. BEING FLEXIBLE. AND I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE NGUYEN. IF WE HAVE THE MONEY WE DON'T DO IT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY WE DON'T DO IT WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT SELF THAT'S JUST MY TWO CENTS. BUT SENATOR OAKS USE ME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES OF. SENATOR CHAU BUG. GOOD MORNING. A SIMILAR MEDINA GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE CANADA. I DID HAVE A QUESTION- WE DID HAVE A LOT OF AT. THE BACK AND THEN INPUT FROM CONCERNS FROM MY DISTRICT FROM DISTRICT TWENTY THREE. AND I NEEDED TO ASK YOU FIRST OF ALL. AS A FORMER ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER. TEACHER I ABSOLUTELY VALUE OUR TEACHERS WHO ARE. IN THE FIELD- I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DO HAVE AB IT'S COOL BOARD MEMBER AS WELL AS HE WE HAVE BE SURE QUITE A BIT AND IN COMMON IN THAT RESPECT- I ALSO. FROM THE TEACHER'S PERSPECTIVE THEY ALWAYS WANNA HE WANTS SECURITY THAT'S YOU KNOW WE WILL GRAVITATE TOWARD TOWARD THAT SHE MINIATURE. ON THE SCHOOL BOARD PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE TO MANAGE WE HAVE TO JUST AS A BUSINESS WE HAVE TO BE- REPAIRED. WE HAVE TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WE HAVE TO WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND WE KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS ONLY. AS SUCCESSFUL AS- HAS BEEN LOOK FOR PROVIDE THE- ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE PROVIDE THE- THE RESOURCES AS WELL AS BE ABLE TO RETAIN AND- KEEP OUR RETAIN AND HIRE. ARE THE BEST QUALIFIED TEACHERS. SO THAT IS A BENEFIT TO OUR COMMUNITY TO OUR CHILDREN- AND SO FORTH SO THAT'S. THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I'M WORKING WITH- I'M NOT A- I KNOW TO ASK THE- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AS OF MARCH THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN SO. I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE CONCERNS OF THE LOCAL DISTRICTS HAVE- THAT ADDRESSED. AND MOST IMPORTANT LET'S SEE THE LAST SET OF AMENDMENTS- TO. JUST TRYING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE ADDRESSED ANY OTHER CONCERNS- LOCALLY TO FOR THIS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE AB. AS IS IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR MY FOR MY DISTRICT- I THINK WE ARE HEARING. LIVE KIND OF COMPETING CONCERNS AND THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY. YOU KNOW WE VOTE. AND WHICH WE THINK ARE THE THEM THE MAYBE PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETING CONCERNS. AS FAR AS THE AMENDMENTS YOUR RIGHTS ARE B&lt;c.cyan&gt;- THERE HAVEN'T&lt;/c&gt; BEEN ANY TAKEN- BUT AS I SAID TO CENTER DOLLY.

A CHILL VIBE NO COURTESY HI FOR TO THE AYE DELHI. DELHI NO GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN I CAN I. WILL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU. OUR NEXT UP IS OUR FINAL BILL OF THE DAY AND IT IS AB EIGHT FIFTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. WHEN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PROPERLY CLEANED. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME GOOD MORNING. THE NEW THE PLEASE GO AHEAD MORNING THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES- TECHNICAL AMENDMENT. AB EIGHT ONE FIVE WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THE SCHOOL NURSE SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA BY CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW- BY STATING THAT ELEAZAR. ARE AUTHORIZED TO OFFER IN HOUSE SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS TO QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL ROLE NURSES PLAY IN SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CHILDREN ATTENDED SCHOOL WITHOUT A NURSE PRESENT. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE WORST NURSE TO STUDENT RATIOS IN THE COUNTRY WITH TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS FOR EVERY SCHOOL NURSE. THE SCHOOL NURSE SHORTAGE IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING AS CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AMONG STUDENTS SUCH AS CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND ASTHMA CONTINUE TO RISE WITHOUT SCHOOL NURSES NON MEDICAL SCHOOL STAFF MUST PROVIDE CRITICAL HEALTH SERVICES. THAT STUDENTS NEED INCLUDING ADMINISTERING INSULIN MONITORING SIGNIFICANT ALLERGIES AND ASSISTING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. UNDER CURRENT LAW A CANDIDATE WHO WANTS TO BECOME A SCHOOL NURSE MUST HOLD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE- AND A NURSING LICENSE IN ADDITION SCHOOL NURSE CANDIDATES MUST COMPLETE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF COURSE WORK. TO RECEIVE A CLEAR SCHOOL NURSE SERVICES CREDENTIAL HOWEVER ONLY FOR UNIVERSITIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE CURRENTLY OFFER PROGRAMS THAT CAN GRANT A CLEAR SCHOOL NURSE SERVICES. CREDENTIAL AB EIGHT EIGHT ONE FIVE CREATES AN ADDITIONAL PIPELINE FOR SCHOOL NURSE CANDIDATES TO RECEIVE THIS CREDENTIAL BY ALLOWING ELEAZAR TO OFFER IN HOUSE CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS. THESE ALLEY A SPONSORED PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ALLEY A SPONSORED CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS TO MEET THE SAME QUALITY STANDARDS AND RIGOR AS THOSE EXPECTED OF POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. INSTITUTIONS THAT CURRENTLY CURRENTLY OFFER THESE CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO DR MARKEL NAVA WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND TRISTEN BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN SO WE HAVE YOUR LEAD SUPPORT ONE IN PERSON ONE ON THE LINE WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE PERSON ON A LINE MR- MARKETING OFTEN. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES- MORNING CHAIR LEYVA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF MY NAME IS MARCO NAVA AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS ADMINISTRATOR OF INDUCTION AND CREDENTIALING IN THE HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FIFTEEN AT AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LUIS ST. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED HAVE COLLABORATED WITH EXISTING INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION BASED SCHOOL URSE CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS FOR YEARS. OUR NURSES HAVE SERVED AS PRESET PRECEPTORS FOR STUDENT NURSES AS WELL AS FOR OUR OWN SCHOOL NURSES SEEKING TO EARN THEIR CLEAR SCHOOL NURSE SERVICES CREDENTIAL DESPITE OUR CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. H. E. BASED SCHOOL NURSE SERVICES CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS ISSUE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLEAR CREDENTIALS EACH YEAR COMPARED TO THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED PRELIMINARY CREDENTIALS ISSUED BY CTC. THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRELIMINARY AND CLEAR CREDENTIALS SEEMS TO SUGGEST A STATEWIDE ATTRITION PROBLEM AMONG NEW SCHOOL NURSES THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF WITHIN OUR L. E. AGE. WE SURVEYED OUR ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY NURSES CURRENTLY SERVING WITH A PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL. ONLY ENROLLED IN A CLEAR PROGRAM THE OTHER 80% NOT ENROLLED EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN CLEARING THEIR CREDENTIALS IN AN ALLEY A BASE PROGRAM THEY SAW IT AS AN INCENTIVE TO CLEAR THEIR CREDENTIALS AS WELL AS THE RISK RETENTION STRATEGY. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED VIEWS THE PROVISIONS OF AB EIGHT FIFTEEN AT CREATING AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION TO BUT NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR EXISTING CLEAR CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS OFFERED BY POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS. THIS BILL DOES NOT FORESEE FIFTY TO GRANT AN APPLICATION FROM AN ALLEY A BASE PROGRAM IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THE AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER APPROVAL THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE LED BASED PROGRAMS COMPULSORY IT GRAND FINALE AB OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR CTC APPROVAL. THROUGHOUT THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC SCHOOL NURSES HAVE BEEN AMONG THE FRONT LINE WORKERS SERVING OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. PROVIDED COVERT NINETEEN TESTING SCREENING TRACING AND ADMINISTERING VACCINES. SCHOOL NURSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE BACK OF THE PANDA FIRST IN TERMS HELPING. FEELING MANY YEARS TO. FORTY THREE. LOS ANGELES AS TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FIFTEEN AND URGES YOUR YES VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK OU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT MISTER BROWN WILL GO.

WE'RE VERY EXCITED AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL- IT WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO THAT I'M SURE YOU SAW THE HEADLINES ACROSS THE NATION READ FRED WAS TAKING- BIG SWAP THAT WHAT THE OLD GUARD WAS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT FISCAL ISSUES IT WAS ABOUT EQUITY FOR STUDENTS. INCLUDING THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WE SEE THAT THE PROLIFERATION OF SCHOOL NURSES ACROSS OUR OUR STATE. IS A HUGE CONCERN AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT OF COURSE I'M HERE TO SAY IT IN A POST PANDEMIC WORLD WE ARE- SO FOCUSED ON. BEING ABLE TO HAVE MORE SCHOOLS WITH NURSES ON SITE. AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS OUT OF THE BOX- IDEA THAT AS THE OTHER AND MY COLLEAGUE ON THE ON THE LINE SAID. IS SUPPLEMENTAL TO THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF GETTING. CREDENTIALED NURSES ON TWO CAMPUSES WE THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP US SPEED UP- THE CURRENT SYSTEM UNDER THE SAME GUARDRAILS OF QUALITY THAT ARE- YOU IMPOSE CURRENTLY AND SO WE FIND THAT THIS WILL HOPEFULLY PROLIFERATE SCHOOL NURSES ON OUR CAMPUSES AND HELP OUR STUDENTS IMMENSELY. IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE HAD CFT VERY TRULY BELIEVE IN IS HAVING ACCESS TO SCHOOL NURSES EVERYWHERE SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL. FOR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS TO BE AUTHORING THIS AND HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH MANAGEMENT AT LAUSD ON THIS ONE IT'S BEEN A HUGE CONCERN ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE LOCAL THE UNITED TEACHERS OF LOS ANGELES.

IS SAMANTHA BLACKBURN IS MY CALLAHAN WILL START WITH YOU. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS RACHEL MCCLANAHAN AND I AM THE COORDINATOR OF THE CALIPHATE BULLETIN GOMEZ CREDENTIAL PROGRAM AND A FORMER SCHOOL MARCH. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR SCHOOL NURSES. THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTED HAS FINALLY BEEN MADE CLEAR. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THIS RECOGNITION THE BILL DEMONSTRATES THAT BONUSES ARE STILL EXPENDABLE ENOUGH TO BE RELEGATED TO A CREDENTIAL PROGRAM WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. RATHER THAN IN THE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF NURSING ALONGSIDE THEIR PEERS TRAINING TO WORK IN THE ICU COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS AND BASICALLY EVERYTHING ALL OTHER NURSING SPECIALTY AREA. GONNA TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS THE NIGHT THE UNITED BUT THE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IS NO LESS IMPORTANT. IF WE VALUE THE WORK IS COLLECTED AS MUCH AS WE VALUE THE WORK OF ICE AND ICU NURSES OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSE THERE. WHY WOULD WE NOT COMMIT TO ENSURING THAT THEY RECEIVE THE SAME HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. DON'T CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THEY SERVE ALSO DESERVE BEST. HELLO THAN TO EDUCATE IN AND A BE MARCH. BY APPROACH THAT IS LIMITED AND SCOPE BECAUSE IT WILL NOT BE BASS ON OVER. NATIONAL EDUCATION STANDARDS. TRUE IT MIGHT NEED THE BASIC CREDENTIALING CRITERIA THAT STUDENTS ATTENDING UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS WE SEE MORE THAN JUST A FEW CLASSES TO EARN A CREDENTIAL. UNIVERSITY EDUCATED NURSES ARE PART OF THE VAST STRUCTURE A STANDARDIZED. EVIDENCE BASED PROFESSIONAL NURSING PROGRAM. ANY PROGRAM NURSES INCLUDING FULL NURSES ARE SPECIFICALLY TRAINED ON HOW TO PROVIDE CARE TO MEET LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL HEALTH IN EQUITY GOAL SET FORTH BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE AND OTHERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT HELP THE NURSING SHORTAGE IF SIMPLY ALLOWS FOR A LOWER QUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAM NARROWLY FOCUSED ON ALLEY EIGHT. PLEASE SUPPORT THE PROFESSION AND DISCIPLINE OF NURSING AND SCHOOL NURSES. BY KEEPING ALL NURSING EDUCATION. IN THE UNIVERSITY WHERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE TO BLACK PLEASE. WHEN YOU'RE READY. MORNING MY NAME IS SAMANTHA BLACKBURN. AND I COORDINATE THE SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM AT SACRAMENTO STATE. WELL I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE IS EXPLORING WAYS TO SUPPORT WELL NOTHING. AB EIGHT FIFTEEN IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO SO. AND LEN OWNER'S CREDENTIAL PROGRAM WILL LIMIT IT DANCE. AND PLACE A CEILING ON THE SALARY INCREASE. A SCHOOL NURSE UNDER THE L. E. A. PROPOSAL WOULD NOT GENERATE COLLEGE UNIT. PAUL FULLER SAYS ARE ENCOURAGE ALL NURSES ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE TO EARN A MASTER'S DEGREE OR HIGHER THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO AN ALLEY A PROGRAM. MANY LA A PAIN SCALES REQUIRE COLLEGE UNIT INCREASE OR THE BAND ALONG WITH CANCELLED YEAH. WITHOUT THE NECESSARY COLLEGE IN A CUSTOMER'S RECEIVING THEIR CREDENTIALS WITH THE L. A. CREDENTIAL PROGRAM WOULD BE LIMITED IN THE EARNING POTENTIAL. ALSO WE ALREADY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SERVE ALL YOUR CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND OUR CAPACITY IS GROWING. THERE ISN'T A BACKLOG FOR A WEIGHTLESS ENTER ANY OF THE THREE THE US IS GONNA THINK PROGRAM. ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS CATER TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CANDIDATES BY OFFERING VIRTUAL COURSE. COURSE OFFERINGS AND LIMIT THE NUMBER OF IN PERSON DATE. THE INCREASE ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE. CURRENTLY SAN FRANCISCO STATE IS A FINE TO THE CDC TO OPEN THE BORDERS PROVINCIAL PROGRAM STARTING IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE START WITH THE START OF ABOUT THIRTY STUDENTS AND CAPACITY TO UPSCALE AS PART. LAST WE ALL OF THAT ALLEY NEED MORE SCHOOL IN OUR WHO ARE BETTER SUPPORT. HOWEVER A ONE OFF PROGRAM THAT THERE'S A SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS NOT BENEFICIAL. TO EITHER THE SCHOOL NURSING CANDIDATES. OR TO THE NURSING PROFESSION AS A WHOLE. THEREFORE WE ENCOURAGE ELLIE IS TO PARTNER WITH THE CSU AND DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT RECRUIT NEW CANDIDATES THAT RESULT IN SCHOOL NURSING CANDIDATES. HAVING CAREER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. HAVING A STRONG WELL EDUCATED AND SUSTAINABLE WORK FOR. AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVING NURSING CARE. THAT THEY CONTRACT. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO HAVE ANYONE HERE IN ROOM FORTY TO A THREE WITCHES WHO WISHES TO SUPPORT- EXPRESSED OPPOSITION SAYING NONE. OF THE ROOM TWENTY FORTY SEEN NONE MISTER MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE KEEP ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHT FIFTEEN PLEASE. CERTAINLY HAD NO SET UP POSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO NOW FOR US ONCE AGAIN ONE FOLLOWED BY. ZERO- FIND SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD YES THIS IS LYDIA BORN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ORGANIZATION I AM WE CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUES WE ARE ASKING FOR A NO VOTE ON AB EIGHT FIFTEEN- THANK YOU- AFTER SHOWING NO FOR THE LIGHTS CUTE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. A CENTER PAM. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND SOME MEMBER RIVAS FIRST OF ALL- SHE DEBTS AND- THAT'S A SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE- SHORTAGE OF SCHOOL NURSES IN FACT- IN MY CAREER AS A PEDIATRICIAN ACTUALLY SERVED AS THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT FOR- SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO- SENTIMENTS A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE THE LARGER ONES. VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SCHOOL NURSES AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS- AND- THIS IS SO- HIMSELF AND NOT ON MY BY THE WAY I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SCHOOL HEALTH- TRANSACTION FOR AMERICA PEDIATRIC SO IT'S A PARTICULAR INTEREST OF MINE. AND I GUESS- I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR BILL NOT WITH YOUR GOAL BECAUSE I APPRECIATE AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO TRY TO. CALL BUT- I GUESS ONE THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS THAT- BASICALLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN ALLEY A AND I AND I DON'T KNOW THERE'S MORE AND L. A. U. S. D.'S PLANE TO DO THIS OR NOT- SO I WAS JUST LAS ENCINAS OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS. IS A REAL WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING CENTER STAND THE THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON THE PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM. YES THIS OF THE CTC THE TEACHERS CREIGHTON- APPROVES THESE PROGRAMS AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS JUST ALLOW THEM. TO CONSIDER- A SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM THAT IS BASED OUT OF AN ALLEY A- WHILE THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED- WE HAVE OTHER- COUNTY. OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND SUPPORT INCLUDING HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHASTA COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE PLANS TO DO THIS BUT THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THIS IS SO I THINK ONE OF THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME SORT OF COMPOUND IS SORT OF CONFLATING A COUPLE THINGS SO YES SCHOOL NURSES PRACTICE IN SCHOOLS AND AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING- BUT THEIR MAIN ROLE THERE IS ACTUALLY. HEALTH I MEAN THE HEALTH SERVICES NOT THE EDUCATION SO. WELL CERTAINLY SOMETIMES SCHOOL NURSES CAN BE INVOLVED IN TEACHING THINGS STUDENTS AND SO FORTH. SO I THINK THE ON THE COMMISSION TEACHER CREDENTIALING WHICH IS VERY FOCUSED ON EDUCATORS AND EDUCATION STANDARDS WHICH IS THEIR ROLE NOT SURE IS THE RIGHT BODY BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY ADDRESSING THE HEALTH PART SIDE OF THINGS THEY'RE NOT EXPERTS AND HEALTHCARE EXPERTS IN EDUCATION. EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS- A JUST TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH SCHOOL NURSES- AS A MEDICAL CONSULTANT. SCHOOL NURSES HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF FAIRLY CAN END UP TAKING CARE VERY COMPLEX PATIENTS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT OF COURSE EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT EVERY CHILD HAS A RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION. SO THEY'RE IN THE SCHOOL DEPRIVE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. THEY MAY NEED SOMEONE TO FEED THEM THROUGH A G. TWO MAY NEED TO HAVE OTHERS- K. AND SO FORTH. AND FOR WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WORKING THE SCHOOL NURSES OFTENTIMES THAT WAS. WHAT I DID WAS. TRY TO GIVE THEM ADVICE ON HOW TO MANAGE THESE PATIENTS BECAUSE- ESSENTIALLY THE SCHOOL NURSE THAT IS FAIRLY INDEPENDENT I MEAN FACTORED THE EXPERT SO WE'LL BUT TIMES. THE OTHER STAFF GO TO THEM AND ASK THEM HOW HOW TO HANDLE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT HEALTH ISSUES SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY- WHICH OUT AS A HEADACHE HERE'S- A TYLENOL AND I WAS WATCHING MY OFFICE AND WE ACTUALLY CAN DO FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED THEY HAVE TO. THE HANDLE FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED THINGS. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT- WERE GOING TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE- CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW THAT NURSES- WHO ARE INTO IN DOING- ARE VERY CAREFUL WHY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS TAKEN TO RELEASE REQUIRED BACHELORS DEGREE. BUT IN FACT MANY SCHOOL NURSES ACTUALLY DO HAVE MASTERS DEGREES BECAUSE- THE AMOUNT OF- SKILL THAT IT TAKES ACTUALLY MANAGE THESE. SOMEWHAT COMPLEX PATIENTS AND ALSO TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECT AS WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH PERSON FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT FOR THE SCHOOL AND SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE CONFLICTING MULTIPLE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR. SCHOOL NURSES. SO I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS- THAT BY HAVING THE CTC AND I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TESTIFYING FOR WERE LIKE HUMAN RESOURCES ADMINISTRATOR CITING HERE PEOPLE FROM THE SCHOOL HEALTH COMMUNITY SAYING HEY THIS IS. THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT GETTING MORE SCHOOL NURSES- BY HERE IS THAT FROM THE SCHOOL HEALTH COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STANDARDS AND- ARE WE GONNA HAVE SCHOOL NURSES NOW I UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE THE SCHOOL NURSES WE HAVE SCHOOL STAFF EVEN THROWN AT THIS POSITION BUT SCHOOL NURSES FROM THE POSITION WHERE. THEY THE WHERE WE'RE BASICALLY- HILLS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE W. F. THREE DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE- AGAIN THE STANDARDS ARE APPLIED TO THEM ARE NOT REALLY STANDARDS RELATED NURSING THEIR STANDARDS RELATED TO. YOU KNOW EDUCATION- AND SO WHILE THEY ARE PRACTICING AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING I THINK THAT I WOULD PREFER THAT IF WE WOULD HAVE AN ENTITY. THAT WAS FOCUSED ON NURSING. BE THE ONE THAT HAS TO SIGN OFF ON WHATEVER PROGRAM IS. YOU KNOW SUFFICIENT AND SO I GET THAT YOU DID HAVE LANGUAGE SAYING WELL THE CDC HAS TO ON THE ON THE PRICE THE SAME STANDARDS BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY IN A GOOD PLACE TO INTERPRET WHETHER DISPERSED THAT THAT OTHER. PROGRAM ACTUALLY. HAD THE RIGHT STANDARDS ARE NOT A- NURSING- AS A STANDARDS ORGANIZATION WRITER AND EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS ORGANIZATION. SO PERHAPS- SO ANYWAY I SO I DO HAVE MY CONCERNS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SOME ANSWERS TO THAT- WITH YOU I ANSWER IT NOW OR TO CLOSE- BUT- IT YOU KNOW I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT. THE THAT. THE CDC IS THE MAIN BACKSTOPS TO BE SURE THAT THESE NURSES MEET THE STANDARD AND- AND SO. FORTY ONE APPEALS TO SUPPORT BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CAN EXCLUDE PROCEED WITH THE SENATE THANK YOU FOR. YOUR CONCERNS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT- THE SCHOOL NAY. CURRENTLY THE CTC. AS EVEN TODAY APPROVED THE SCHOOL NURSING CREDENTIAL. THIS BILL IS NOT CHANGING THAT I KNOW YOU YOU EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS. ABOUT THE CTC BEING THE ENTITY. TO APPROVE THESE PROGRAMS WERE RIGHT NOW LIKE WHAT WAS MENTIONED SAN FRANCISCO STATE WANTS TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM. THE CTC. IS GOING TO APPROVE THE SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL- THE SCHOOL NURSE CANDIDATES ALL. ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND A NURSING LICENSE WHICH HAS YOU KNOW THAT IS AN ENTITY. THE IN OUR STATE THAT APPROVES THEIR QUALIFICATION. BASED ON THE NURSE SEEN AND MATTER. OF REQUIREMENTS WRITER- SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE. THIS PROGRAM IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL YEAR FOR A NURSE TO PRACTICE ALREADY A LICENSED NURSE. TO PRACTICE IN A SCHOOL SETTING- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE PROPOSING TODAY. THE CTC ALREADY APPROVED THAT CREDENTIAL FOR ANY INSTITUTION- A POST SECONDARY INSTITUTION IN OUR STATE. OF THE SO WE ARE NOT CHANGING NOW ALL WE'RE DOING IS. ALLOWING THE CTC TO CONSIDER. AN APPLICATION FROM AN ALLEY EIGHT OF THE CTC WILL APPLY THE SAME QUALITY STANDARDS- AS IT CURRENTLY DOES TO EVALUATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. THEY CAN DENY THE APPLICATION. APPROVED IT WOULD BE UP TO THE C. T. C. USING THE EXACT SAME STANDARDS THAT THEY WOULD USE ON CAL STATE FULLERTON- SAN FRANCISCO DATE SAN FRANCISCO STATE AND OTHER- UNIVERSITIES IN OUR STATE. I AM I'M NOT SURE IF THAT CLEARS IT UP I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR- THAT THIS IS NOT A NURSING LICENSE RIGHT THIS IS THE SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL THAT IS JUST ONE YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND THEN LICENSE- THAT AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL THERE'S CANDIDATES ALREADY HAS WHEN THEY ENTER. THE NET AND APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION AND I KNOW YOU'VE YOU KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS SO- I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN AND OTHERS WORKED PRETTY CLOSELY SCHOOL NURSES AND THE FACT THA SCHOOL NURSING ORGANS YOU KNOW SCHOOL HEALTH FOLKS ARE OPPOSED. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT IN ADDITION TO THE C. T. C. BECAUSE WE HAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO. YELL FOR READY GOOD REASONS IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCREASE THE NUMBER SCHOOL NURSES THEY HAVE. AN EIGHT YEAR AGREED THEY DO HAVE A LICENSE- FROM THE NURSING BOARD BUT PRIDE MORE SPECIFICALLY E. JUST I DON'T KNOW IT'S REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE SOME SPECIALTY IN SCHOOL NURSING- IN THAT- LICENSE GENERALLY JUST HAVE A GENERAL LICENSE BUT- I'DLIKE TO SEE THAT THERE'S SOME ASPECT OF REVIEW- THAT AND IT IS ON THE NURSING SIDE OF THINGS I GOT ON THE HEALTH PROFESSION SIDE OF. ON THE SCHOOL HEALTH NURSING SIDE OF THINGS TO BE SURE THAT THOSE TYPES OF THOSE STANDARDS ARE ARMED ARE MET BY THE END BY THE EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE. SYSTEM WHEN YOUR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT THOSE THAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE MET I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE C. T. C. AVAILABLE TODAY AND THEY'RE NOT ON THE LINE- BUT I AM ASSUMING THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE. SOME OF THOSE- IT'LL LIKE CRITERIA WHEN THEY'RE EVALUATING THE CAL STATES RIGHT BECAUSE THEY CURRENTLY APPROVE. THE SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL- BUT I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT PROCESS BUT- THIS IS. HOW ARE STATE APPROVED NURSE CREDENTIALS. YEAH I DID- THE CTC- NO I BUT I MEAN YEAH I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK ON IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT PROCESS- EVALUATE IT- WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK ON THAT. OKAY YET NOW WOULD BE THAT WOULD APPLY TO. THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. INSTITUTIONS ALSO RIGHT. BUT CITED FREESHIP THAT AND- IT'S AND I ALSO WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO HELP AND I DON'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME OR COMMITTEES I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING AND- I'M GOING THAT MAYBE CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE THOSE KENNEDY. SO AND- BEFORE IT COMES TO THE FLOOR I THINK IF WE CAN TO SATISFY THE ISSUE ABOUT HOW TO JUST BE SURE THAT WE VETS V. SO. BECAUSE FINANCES OF THE SCHOOL DISCUSS SELFISH EIGHT EIGHT ESSENTIALLY PROGRAM AT SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A SEAT YOU SEE IS THIS GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT SO L. U. S. T. I THINK THAT YEAH AS SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY SOUND CREDENTIALS AND ACCREDITATION BOARD. WE WILL BE SURE THE REVIEW OF THAT IS NOT SIMPLY A PAPER REVIEW WHICH AB SIDE. THAT IT'S IT THERE'S AN EXAMINATION OF THE- PREPARATION AS WELL AND SO MY GUESS IS THAT AGAIN I'M GETTING GAS BECAUSE WE HAVE CITY SEE HERE IS THAT. WHEN THEY WERE IT AT LEAST YOU KNOW VARIOUS PROGRAM SETS AT SAC STATE BECAUSE OF THE FACULTY STRUCTURE AND SO FORTH THERE IT'S FIGHT LESS NEED TO GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL. ABOUT THAT LIKE A BIT MORE OF A- VERSUS IF WE KNOW. IT'S AN HANDS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS A EIGHTEEN IN EDUCATIONAL. NORMALLY THE PROPER OF NURSES RIGHT. AROUND LIKE THESE THE SCS PROGRAMS ACTUALLY NURSING SCHOOLS. THE PERHAPS NEEDS TO BE PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE ON THE GROUND EXAMINATION REVIEW. RICHARD DATE- THAT OF NURSES THAT GET THIS CREDENTIAL- YOU DON'T MEET THE STANDARDS AND THAT THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. IS SUCH ON THE NURSING SIDE OF THINGS I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE EDUCATION SIDE OF THINGS. IS THE- SUFFICIENT SO- AND DOES IT BEYOND JUST SIMPLY LIKE A WHITE. PICKED OFF THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS ON ON A PIECE OF PAPER SO. PERHAPS WE CAN WORK ON THAT HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THIS BILL IS NOT CHANGING THE APPROVAL PROCESS. OF OCCUR A SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM IT'S CONTINUING TO DO WHAT THE STATE ALREADY DOES. TO APPROVE ANY SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM ACROSS THE STATE. WHAT I THINK WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU'RE BRINGING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON AND DISCUSS FURTHER ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR EXPERTISE. IS ARE WE WHAT STANDARDS ARE WE USING TO APPROVE ANY SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM. YES AND SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING. BUT IT IS I THINK A VALID CONCERN AND- I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE COULD REVIEW TOGETHER AND- YES I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. ME TOO AND- WELL I WON'T BILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATIONS AND HOPEFULLY LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR BILL ON THE FLOOR.
