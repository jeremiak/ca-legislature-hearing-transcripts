HOUSING OPPOSE ON THE BILL BUT

TO DO FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.604

OPPOSE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.615
AND- WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.183
WHERE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GET

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.952
CREDIT. IF YOU HAVE BAD CREDIT

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.720
AND YOU HAVE. NOT FULFILLED

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:50.956
YOUR OBLIGATIONS IN THE PAST OF

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.158
PAYING YOUR BILLS. AND MAKING

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.694
SURE THAT YOUR CREDIT IS GOOD.

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:58.196
THEN YOU CAN'T JUST EXPECT. OF

00:19:58.263 --> 00:19:59.598
A IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:00.966
TAKE A RISK ON YOU WHEN YOU'RE

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.268
A BAD RISK IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.537
THE WAY PEOPLE GET OUT OF THAT

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.272
SITUATION IS THEY GET THE SHORT

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.675
TERM LOANS AND YES THEY ARE A

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:10.742
VERY HIGH INTEREST RATE BUT

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:11.777
ONCE THEY GO THROUGH THAT

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.512
PROCESS. THEN THEY GO TO. A

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.113
REGULAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.049
AND THEY GO LOOK. I USED I HAD

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.517
BAD CREDIT BUT OVER THE LAST

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.485
YEAR I'VE MAINTAIN MY PAYMENTS.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.521
AT THIS HIGHER INTEREST RATE

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:23.255
AND THE EASE BACK INTO THEIR

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:25.157
CREDIT RATING SO THAT THEY CAN.

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:27.326
ESTABLISH A GOOD CREDIT AGAIN.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.062
BUT TO REQUIRE OR CAT PEOPLE'S

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:31.530
INTEREST RATES AND I REALIZE

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.231
THAT THEY DO HAVE HIGH INTEREST

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:34.967
RATES. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:37.436
THAT. YOU IF YOU CAP IT ARE

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:38.337
THEY REALLY GOING TO TAKE A

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.238
RISK AND INVEST AND LET PEOPLE

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.741
HAVE HIGH RISK LOANS. OUT THERE

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:44.610
SO THEY CAN TRY TO RE ESTABLISH

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:46.411
THEIR CREDIT. YOU'RE ASKING THE

00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:47.713
BANKS OR THEIR ASKING LENDING

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:48.947
INSTITUTIONS ARE THESE

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:50.716
ORGANIZATIONS THAT LAND TO

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:52.351
THESE. PARTICULAR PEOPLE THAT

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.152
WANT. TO RE ESTABLISH THEIR

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:56.955
CREDIT AFTER DESTROYING IT. FOR

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.991
WHATEVER REASON. AND TO HAVE

00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:01.026
THAT TO HAVE THAT CAP AND NOT.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.160
AND NOT HAVE A LENDING

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:04.363
INSTITUTION AVAILABLE FOR THEM

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:05.664
TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS CREDIT TO

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:06.898
REBUILD THEIR CREDIT. IS

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.634
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WILL

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.005
CAUSE A DETRIMENT TO HARM. TO

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:13.538
THEM IN THE LONG TERM THE

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:17.943
FUTURE MEYER J. NO VOTE. THANK

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.911
YOU SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:21.046
MISTER PRESIDENT I HEARD A LOT

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.182
ABOUT THESE. A PAYDAY. LOANS

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:25.384
AND DIDN'T HAVE A VERY

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.019
FAVORABLE ATTITUDE BUT I DIDN'T

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.488
THINK KIND OF THOUGHT THE WAY

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:30.055
MY COLLEAGUE JUST DESCRIBED

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.525
THAT. IT WAS AN OPPORTUNE FOR

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:35.327
POOR PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS TO

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:37.863
SOME MONEY BUT WHEN I SAW

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:40.132
ACTUAL AGREEMENTS. COPIES OF

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:43.568
AGREEMENTS. WHERE THEY HAD

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.303
BORROWED TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.540
MAYBE AND IT WENT UP TO TEN AND

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:49.841
TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:51.343
WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY GOING

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.312
TO PAY BACK. I WAS FLOORED I

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.715
WAS SHOCKED HOW COULD WE TAKE

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.817
ADVANTAGE OF POOR PEOPLE THAT

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:01.853
WAY THAT MEANS THEY BECOME FOR

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.357
EVER INDEBTED. AND THEY CAN'T

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:07.793
KEEP UP AND THAT JUST SEEMED

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:10.696
LIKE A COMPLETE ABUSE SO

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:12.531
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:14.433
TAKING A RISK AND COMPLETELY

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:16.802
ABUSING OF POOR PEOPLE AND

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:18.970
FORCING THEM TO STAY IN POVERTY

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:21.840
FOR MANY MORE YEARS SO THAT'S

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:22.407
FRANKLY WHAT CONVINCED ME TO

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:27.512
SUPPORT THIS BILL. SENATE ALLEN.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:28.980
THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT IS

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:30.148
ONE OF ALSO MENTION THAT WE DID

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:32.150
PUT IN THE SENATE FINANCIAL

00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:33.819
LITERACY IN THIS BILL SO THAT

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:36.021
WE CAN EDUCATE THOSE FOLKS TO

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:37.322
WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PAYING IN

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:39.224
A CAPTIVE SO I WANTED TO BRING

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:40.158
THAT POINT UP I THINK IT'S

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:41.460
CRITICAL IT WAS IT WAS

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:42.694
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THOSE

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:43.795
FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.497
THAT THE LOANS NEED TO KNOW

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:46.698
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN AND

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:48.133
HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE WE

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:48.867
WOULD TEACH THESE KIND OF

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.535
THINGS IN SCHOOL WHERE THE

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:51.603
COMPOUNDING INTEREST AS YOUR

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.438
FRIEND IF YOU'RE SAVING MONEY

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:54.606
AND IT YOUR ENEMY IF YOU'RE

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:57.042
BORROWING MONEY NO TO THE

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:57.642
THINGS. THAT PEOPLE TO BORROW

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:00.278
MONEY NEEDED NO. THANK YOU

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:03.882
SENATOR SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:04.783
YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.718
RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.053
AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.055
HARD WORK ON IT THIS IS NOT AN

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:12.390
EASY SPACE TO DO WORK IN AND

00:23:12.457 --> 00:23:13.525
THE REASON THAT IT'S NOT IS

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:18.196
THAT WHILE WE MAY NOT LIKE THE

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:20.499
INTEREST RATES THEY GET CHARGED

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:22.067
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT PEOPLE

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.769
NEED ACCESS TO MONEY. AND THEY

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:27.506
NEED A REGULATED INDUSTRY IN

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:30.075
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:31.810
TO THAT MONEY OTHERWISE IF WE

00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:33.879
CLOSE OFF ALL THE ALTERNATIVES

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.514
THEY END UP GOING TO AN

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.950
UNREGULATED MARKET AND SO I

TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:24.754
FOURTEEN. SOME MAY WONDER WHY

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.222
THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN UP THE

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.124
ISSUE AND I THINK THE ANSWER TO

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:31.060
THAT IS SIMPLE WE MUST. WE MUST

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.862
BECAUSE THE STATE CONSTITUTION

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.364
GIVES THE UC REGENTS POWER OVER

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.399
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.001
AND IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:40.136
ADDRESS AN ISSUE PLAGUING THE

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:42.972
SYSTEM. I AND THAT IS THROUGH A

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:45.408
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. WE

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.743
MUST BECAUSE WORKING PEOPLE

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.945
EMPLOYED IN OUR RENOWNED

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:49.645
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ARE GETTING

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:51.914
CUT OUT OF JOBS. THEY'RE

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.182
GETTING CUT OUT OF THE MIDDLE

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:55.585
CLASS. HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.820
BACKBONE OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:59.155
AND THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:01.224
CALIFORNIA IS THE CROWN JEWEL

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:03.526
OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.194
BUT THE UC UNDERMINES ITS

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:07.030
BENEFITS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS BY

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.531
FAILING TO PROVIDE STABLE A

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.967
STABLE LIFESTYLE FOR THE

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:14.470
WORKERS THAT THE UC DEPENDS ON.

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.873
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE UC

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.841
HAS CONTRACTED OUT THOUSANDS OF

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.843
SUPPORT SERVICES JOBS FOR THE

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.412
UNIVERSITY IT'S AN ECONOMIC

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.480
DECISION SEEMINGLY MADE WITHOUT

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:26.082
CONSIDERATION OF HOW THESE

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:28.351
CHOICES MADE BY THE UC AFFECT

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.853
THE LIVES OF THEIR WORKERS.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.522
EACH TIME THE UC MAKES THIS

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.490
CHOICE ELIMINATES THE STABILITY

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:35.925
OF A JOB THAT HAS HEALTH

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:36.959
BENEFITS AND A SECURE

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.395
RETIREMENT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:42.165
TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.499
RECENT YEARS WITH MULTIPLE

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:46.602

INTENT. AND MESSAGE SENT BY THE

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.746

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:59.282
ISSUE FOR DECADES. THE UC HAS

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.716

WHEN YOU THINK OF YOU SEE ARTS

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:08.251

THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS

UC'S ABILITY TO RUN THEIR

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:34.443
MANAGER OF THE BILL RESPONDED

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.345
TO THAT ISSUE SO I DON'T NEED

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:39.882

ACA FOURTEEN MAKES PROVISIONS

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.753
FOR THOSE SITUATIONS.

01:03:43.819 --> 01:03:47.290

THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:58.968
SHOULD SEE WHAT CHANGE NEEDS TO

HAPPEN NOW. IT IS A PHENOMENAL

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.140

FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS. WE

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.794

STANDARDS. IN THE END A CA

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:33.202

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.837
VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TO DECIDE

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.706

EVERY SESSION. I THINK THAT WE

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:23.358

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.712
CALIFORNIA HARD FOUGHT. WE

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:46.315
SHOULD ALLOW THAT. PROCESS TO.

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:47.583
RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE ISSUES

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.651

BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS I

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:11.673
THINK WE SHOULD VOTE NO ON THIS

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I RISE IN

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.582
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WAS

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.584
AROUND IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN WE

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:23.752
WENT THROUGH THE BUDGET CRISIS

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:26.054
IN THE UC SYSTEM PUT EMPLOYEES

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:28.390
ON FURLOUGH THEY INCREASE

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.559
CONTRACTING OUT AND THEY

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.361
REDUCED PAY AND THEY RAISED

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:35.297
TUITION FOR STUDENTS AND WITHIN

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.166
A YEAR. IT WAS LEARNED THAT

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:40.602
SECRETLY THEY HAD GIVEN BONUSES

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.970
TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT THREE

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.839
POINT ONE MILLION OR THEY WERE

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:46.375
PLANNING TO FOUR THIRTY EIGHT

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:49.211
POP EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES AND

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:50.946
THEY WERE DOING THAT AFTER

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:53.715
HAVING MADE RAISES TO TUITION

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:56.318
AND FOR LOW'S TO EMPLOYEES THAT

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.754
WAS A BLATANT DISREGARD AND

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.289
DISRESPECT FOR THE EMPLOYEES

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:02.257
AND IN MY VIEW OF THE

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.693
LEGISLATURE AS WELL BECAUSE WE

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.795
AGREED TO THE TERMS AT THAT

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.597
TIME. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:10.365
THE WE WERE IN OUR WHERE WE

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:12.901
WERE WITH THE ECONOMY I THINK

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:16.571
THIS BILL IS NECESSARY I TRUST

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.006

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.110
GREAT JOB AND TO DO ALL THAT HE

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:24.813
CAN WHILE HE IS ON THE BOARD

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.048
BUT JUST LIKE THIS LEGISLATURE

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:28.750
PASSES BILLS BECAUSE SOMETIMES

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:31.019
WE HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT WE FEEL

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.521
WE CAN WORK WITH AND TRUST AND

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:34.556
OTHER TIMES WE MAY NOT IN THE

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.325
FUTURE. THIS IS A CIRCUMSTANCE

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:37.859
WHERE WE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:40.696
JUST WAS ON THE BOARD AT THIS

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:41.697
POINT IN TIME BUT WE NEED TO

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:45.133
THINK ABOUT HAVING A STRUCTURE

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.601
THERE SO THAT WE DON'T SEE

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:47.469
THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:50.205
AND WE DON'T SEE. THINGS HAPPEN

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:52.474

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:06.835
HAS BEEN WITH US. TO HAVE THIS

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:09.237
ON MATT SOCIAL SERVICES ISSUE

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.939
HANG OVER THIS STATE. FOR SO

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:14.543
LONG. IS APPALLING AND IT IS AN

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:17.546
EMBARRASSMENT. THE COMMON

USED MANY FOR MANY YEARS. TO

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:27.689
EXCLUDE THESE WORKERS FROM FAIR

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:30.492
TREATMENT BY USING THE STATE

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:33.562
CONSTITUTION AS AN EXCUSE ONE

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:36.131
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD RECEIVE

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:36.765
BETTER TREATMENT UNDER OUR LAWS

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:40.168
IS DISCRIMINATORY. I BELIEVE

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:41.203
THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.939
HAVE THE CHANCE TO CORRECT THE

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:47.175
UNFAIRNESS. BY SUPPORTING A CA

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:52.380
FOURTEEN. AS THE STUDENTS STAFF

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:57.052
TEACHERS VISITORS WALK THROUGH

01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:58.320
THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS AND

01:20:58.386 --> 01:20:59.888

CALIFORNIA. WHAT LESSONS ARE

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.561
LEARNED BY PERPETUATING THIS

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:09.497
UNFAIRNESS TO THE WORKERS WHO

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:10.031

UNIVERSITY. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:18.106

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.407
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE. HE

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:24.012
ANSWERED HOW LONG NOT LONG. NOW

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:26.748
THAT SHOULD BE OUR ANSWER. LET

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:29.117
US BEEN TOWARDS JUSTICE. LET

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:31.820
THE VOTERS DECIDE. IT'S BEEN

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:36.091
TOO LONG URGE SUPPORT FOR A CA

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:45.867
MISTER PRESIDENT I THINK THERE

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:48.370
ARE REALLY GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.538
SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I THINK

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:51.139
SOME OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:52.674
BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.377
PROPONENTS OF AC FOURTEEN ARE

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:56.211
LOOKING AFTER IN THEIR

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.280
ESTIMATION THE BEST INTEREST OF

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.715
WORKERS IN UNIVERSITY

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:03.485
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM.

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:05.687
ON THE FLIP SIDE I THINK THERE

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.055
ARE CERTAINLY COMPELLING

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:09.824
ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY I EMPLOYEES

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:12.327
SHOULD TO. OR UNIVERSITY SHOULD

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:13.361
HAVE THE ABILITY AND

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:16.464
FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.166
IN CONTRACT FOR SERVICES AS

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:21.202
NEEDED BECAUSE UNIVERSITY

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.872
SYSTEMS EBB AND FLOW OF THE

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:25.607
NEEDS CHANGE. ON DEPENDING ON

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.676
THE ECONOMY WE CAN EXPECT THAT

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.044
EVEN FURTHER SPECIALLY AS WERE

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.546
EXPECTING OUR ECONOMY TO

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.316
CONTINUE TO SLOW DOWN AS CYCLES

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:38.787
OR INEVITABLE. WHAT I'M HEARING

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.155
THOUGH IT. FROM FOLKS WHO WERE

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.289
SUPPORTING A CA FOURTEEN. ARE

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:44.225
THAT. THE BARGAINING UNIT

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:47.562
PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.096
I WOULD THINK THAT YOU'VE

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:50.932
ALREADY WON TODAY. HOWEVER THIS

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.600
VOTE PLAYS OUT BECAUSE YOU

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:53.835
BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.603
FOREFRONT TO THE HEIGHT OF

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:57.105
POLITICAL AWARENESS AND I WOULD

01:22:57.172 --> 01:23:00.675
THINK THAT THIS. JUST BY VIRTUE

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.677
OF WHAT HAS OCCURRED TODAY.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:05.480
HE'S GOING TO COMPEL FOLKS

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.915
WITHIN THE REGIONS WITHIN THE

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:09.117
BARGAINING UNITS TO TRY TO

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:11.219
REACH AN ACCOMMODATION. AND

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:12.287
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OF THE OPINION

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:15.757
THAT THAT WIN WIN COMMON SENSE

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.293
AND URGENCY ARE PAIRED RESULTS

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.463
OCCUR. AND I THINK THAT CAN

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.499
OCCUR RIGHT NOW. MY COLLEAGUE.

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:25.100
FROM DOWN SOUTH HAD MENTIONED

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:30.739
EARLIER. THIS IS A BROAD SWORD

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:31.272
BEING BROUGHT TO A FAIRLY

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:35.009
LIMITED ISSUE. TO REQUIRE

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:38.546
STATUTORY AUTHORITY. OR ANY

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:41.750
CHANGES TO OCCUR IN STAFFING.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.418
IT JUST SEEMS TERRIBLY TERRIBLY

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:45.920
CUMBERSOME AND FRANKLY IT'S A

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:47.088
FAIT ACCOMPLI AT THAT POINT IT

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:49.090
JUST WOULDN'T HAPPEN SO WE HAVE

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:51.593
NEW LEADERSHIP AT UC WE'VE

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.228
WE'VE GOTTEN RENEWED

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.929
COMMITMENTS THAT THEY WANT TO

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:57.499
TAKE IN EARNEST ANOTHER STAB AT

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:59.501
ALL REACHING AN ACCOMMODATION

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.903
TOWARD UNDERSTANDING OF FOR THE

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:02.771
BARGAINING UNITS IN TERMS

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:04.906
CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT. WHY

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:05.507
WOULDN'T WE BRING THIS MATTER

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:09.244
BACK. LET THE INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:11.346
WERE TASKED WITH REACHING A

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.548
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING DECISIONS

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.984
GIVE THEM IN ANOTHER FEW MONTHS.

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:18.353
WHAT IT HURT IF THIS ISSUE WERE

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.488
BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY AND I

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:24.125
ASKED THAT TO THE MOVERS OF

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:26.561
THIS LEGISLATION. WHAT WOULD BE

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.296
THE DOWN FALL WE COULD TAKE

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:30.231
THIS MATTER UP IN JANUARY ALL

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:32.167
OTHER BE ENOUGH TIME I SUSPECT

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.202
TO PUT IT ON ON THE BALLOT IF

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:36.070
IT IT'S STILL PROVED SO I THINK

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:37.338
THAT IS AN OPTION I'VE ALWAYS

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:39.107
BEEN THE OPINION THAT WHEN

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:40.775
LEGISLATORS PANIC BAD POLICIES

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.877
MADE. AND I THINK GRAY HERE

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:44.379
WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE WERE

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:47.715
PANICKING AND USING A BROAD

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:49.751
SWORD ON A DISCREET AND LIMITED

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:53.555
ISSUE THAT FRANKLY MAKES FOR

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:54.122
BAD POLICY. SO I THINK WITH

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:57.258
THAT. I WOULD. I'M CERTAINLY

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.827
GOING TO BE RECOMMENDING EITHER

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:00.728
A NO OR A NEUTRAL ON THIS TO MY

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:02.497
COLLEAGUES. JUST BECAUSE I

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:04.899
THINK THAT COOLER HEADS CAN

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:06.167
PREVAIL NOW THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:08.937
BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT. AND

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.872
LET'S GIVE THE AND YOU SEE AN

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.507

ACCOMMODATIONS I KNOW THAT

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:18.446
FOLKS HAVE SAID. ENOUGH TIME

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:19.180
HAS PASSED AND THEY'VE LOST

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.783
CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS. BUT

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.117
I THINK WITH NEW LEADERSHIP.

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:25.353

THE SOCIAL REFLECTION A LITTLE

HAPPENS IF IT ISN'T. CLEARLY WE

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:37.811
HAVE TO ADDRESS WORKER

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:40.314

PROTECT ALL WORKERS INCLUDING

01:38:41.815 --> 01:38:43.250

HARDEST WORKING LOWEST PAID AND

01:38:45.386 --> 01:38:47.254
MOST VULNERABLE BECAUSE THAT'S

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:49.089
OUR JOB AND CLEARLY THE

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:51.292

FAILED TO DO SO FOR DECADES.

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:55.629
BUT THIS PROPOSED

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:56.230
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT JUST

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.932
DOESN'T WORK. OBVIOUSLY WE

01:38:58.999 --> 01:39:00.267
CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:01.402
PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:02.736
EMERGENCIES OF THE NATURE OF

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.438
THE REQUIRED RESPONSE BUT IF

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:06.206
THE PROPONENTS ARE WRONG IN

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:07.608
THEIR PREDICTIONS AS TO THE

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:08.609
IMPACT ON ARE YOU SEE HEALTH

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:10.878
CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND THIS

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:13.080
NEW PROCESS WITH THE LANGUAGE

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:13.681
THAT I'VE IDENTIFIED. WHICH IS

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:18.218
FLOOD. NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. OUR

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:20.187
EFFORT TO DO SO IN THE PROCESS

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:22.756
TO DO SO WILL BE HERCULEAN. AND

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:26.260
WE JUST CAN'T WAIVE IT. THERE

01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:28.262
HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY IN THE

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:29.330
FORM OF A CONSTITUTIONAL

01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:31.432
AMENDMENT TO IT TO ACHIEVE THE

01:39:31.498 --> 01:39:32.700
OBJECTIVES THAT ARE ATTEMPTED

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:34.501
TO BE ACHIEVED HERE WE NEED TO

01:39:34.568 --> 01:39:36.837
TAKE BETTER CARE AND PAY BETTER

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:38.272
ATTENTION TO THE LANGUAGE WHEN

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:39.506
WE DRAFT AMENDMENTS TO OUR

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:41.809
STATE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE- FOR

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:45.879
THOSE OF US. CERTAINLY HERE WE

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:46.380
KNOW LANGUAGE FRANKLY IS

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:51.251
IMPORTANT. SO UNFORTUNATELY I

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:53.120
WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.588
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AS

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:57.624
DRAFTED AT THIS POINT HOWEVER I

01:39:57.691 --> 01:39:59.193
COMMIT TO WORKING DILIGENTLY

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.761

TO PIN DOWN A PERMANENT

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:06.834
SOLUTION TO THE ISSUES IS

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.935
ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:09.336
AMENDMENT IS ATTEMPTING TO

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:10.537
ADDRESS IN A MORE CRAFT

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:12.072

STAND READY TO DO SO AND HAVE

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:18.645

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:19.179
DURING THE LAST WEEK OR SO

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:22.182
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS.

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.284
OBVIOUSLY IF THIS MEASURE

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:25.252
PASSES TODAY AND IS APPROVED BY

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:26.920

TAKE CARE OF THESE ISSUES

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:49.576
BEFORE IT GETS WORSE. I'M

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:50.077
CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:52.613
PERMANENTLY FIX THIS ISSUE FOR

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:53.781

PRESIDENT. AS A AS A CAL GRAD.

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:15.269
GO BEARS ANYBODY. AND AS A

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:19.406
FORMER TEACHER AT UCLA I HAVE

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:22.643
DEEP AFFECTION FOR THIS SYSTEM

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.878
I THINK IT IS THE FINEST PUBLIC

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:25.512
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:31.151
WORLD. AND I DON'T INTEND. WITH

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:35.322
THE VOTE HERE TODAY. THAT WE

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:36.723
BREAK THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:38.859
CALIFORNIA IN FACT I THINK WE

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:43.330
CAN STRENGTHEN IT. I WANTED TO

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:46.867
ADDRESS TWO ISSUES ONE OF WHICH

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:50.838
IS ABOUT MONEY. IF YOU LOOK AT

01:41:50.904 --> 01:41:51.972
THE FISCAL ANALYSIS ON THIS

01:41:52.039 --> 01:41:55.542
MEASURE IT TALK ABOUT A ABOUT A

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:56.210
HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:57.544
DOLLAR IMPACT OF THIS

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:02.015
LEGISLATION. WHEN YOU THINK

01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:02.516
ABOUT THE OUTPUT OF THIS

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:04.184
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THE SCALE OF

01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:08.956
ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY THE

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:11.091
SOCIAL MOBILITY THAT WE COULD

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:16.463
POSSIBLY ENABLE. I THINK THAT

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:18.499
IS A MORE THAN FILLABLE GAP.

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:21.768
AND IN MY VIEW. WE'VE BEEN

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:23.370
SHORT CHANGING THE UNIVERSITY

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:26.974
CALIFORNIA FOR TOO LONG. I AM

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.443
VERY EXCITED THAT WE MAY BE

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:33.347
PASSING A AN EDUCATION BONDS.

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:35.115
THAT WOULD PUT TWO BILLION

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:35.749
DOLLARS IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:38.385
GOING FORWARD. WE KNOW THE

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:40.153
BUILDINGS ARE STARTING TO FAIL

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.623
THERE SEISMIC ISSUES UNIVERSITY

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:45.158
CALIFORNIA UCLA AND BERKELEY IN

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:49.062
OTHER CAMPUSES. BUT EVEN ON AN

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.596
ANNUAL BUDGET CYCLE WE GO

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:53.033
THROUGH EVERY YEAR. I THINK

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.903
VOTING FOR THIS MEASURE ENTAILS

01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:57.905
AN OBLIGATION TO STEP UP TO THE

01:42:57.971 --> 01:43:00.307
PLATE FOR THIS LEGISLATURE. TO

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:02.342
HELP FILL THIS GAP. BUT WHAT I

01:43:02.409 --> 01:43:05.546
WANNA SAY IS THAT. WE SHOULD

01:43:05.612 --> 01:43:08.448
NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. OUR

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.584
WORKERS FAIRLY AND HAVING A

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:12.486
FIRST CLASS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.788
I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH. I

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.891
SHOWED UP ON CAMPUS. I FIRST

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:20.227
YEAR LAW SCHOOL ON BANCROFT IN

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:22.296
MEMBER WALKING OUT TO GET A

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:22.729
BITE TO EAT AT THE

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:24.264
INTERNATIONAL HOUSE WHICH IS

01:43:24.331 --> 01:43:26.366
RIGHT UP THE STREET I SAW THESE

01:43:26.433 --> 01:43:27.000
FOLKS IN GREEN. STANDING OUT ON

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:29.703
THE STREET. I WONDERED WHO ARE

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:31.905
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE. SO I

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:34.975
EIGHT I STARTED CONVERSATION

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:38.645
AND IT TURNS OUT. THEY'RE THE

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:40.948
PEOPLE WHO KEPT MY SCHOOL CLEAN.

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:44.718
MADE MY CAMPUS SAFE. SO I COULD

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:45.319
KEEP MY HEAD IN THE BOOKS THEY

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:50.924
GRINDED. AND FOR STUDENTS.

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:53.860
FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS OR EVEN

01:43:53.927 --> 01:43:56.196
US IS LEGISLATORS TO PRETEND

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:56.830
LIKE THOSE PEOPLE ARE INVISIBLE

01:43:56.897 --> 01:44:03.170
JUST WRONG. SO. WHEN WE VOTE

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:05.405
HERE TODAY WHEN I TAKE THIS

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.240
VOTE I'LL BE THINKING OF THOSE

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:11.411
PEOPLE UP THE STREET. TO WORK

01:44:11.478 --> 01:44:11.945
DAY IN AND OUT TO MAKE OUR

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:15.816
SYSTEM GO. BUT I DO NOT THINK

01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:17.884
THIS IS GOING TO BE. A FATAL

01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:20.587
BLOW. TO THE UNIVERSITY

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:24.558
CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE CAN

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:25.859
ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THE MORAL

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.928
HIGH GROUND FOR THIS UNIVERSITY

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:28.428
SYSTEM AND TRULY FORM A

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:32.332
PARTNERSHIP. THAT WILL REQUIRE

01:44:32.399 --> 01:44:34.001
SOME ADDITIONAL STATUTORY WORK

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.969
ON OUR PART. I DO THINK THAT

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:37.671
THERE ARE OUR NEEDS FOR

01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:41.274
ENHANCED FLEXIBILITY. AND THAT

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:44.511
EXPRESS STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:45.145
TO ALLOW FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:48.682
STEP IN. FOR A VARIETY OF

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:51.184
CIRCUMSTANCES NOT ONLY IN THE

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:51.818
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:54.321
SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE BROUGHT

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:54.921
UP BUT ALSO I BELIEVE IN NINE

01:44:54.988 --> 01:44:57.557
POINT FIVE G. TALKS ABOUT THE

01:44:57.624 --> 01:45:00.427
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ACT. I

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:02.663
THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE AMPLE

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:06.767
FLEXIBILITY FOR US HERE TO STEP

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:07.367
UP BUT WE CAN'T JUST TAKE THIS

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:07.968
VOTE AND WALK AWAY. TO PUT OUR

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:11.038
MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH. WE HAVE

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:12.639
TO FIND A WAY STATUTORILY TO

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:16.443
MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM CONTINUES

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.977
TO BE EXCELLENT. AND GROWS

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:21.281
ITSELF. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING

01:45:21.348 --> 01:45:24.785
THE MEASURE HERE TODAY. BUT I

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:26.820
HOPE WE CAN START TO TURN THE

01:45:26.887 --> 01:45:28.388
PAGE AND END THIS YEAR OF

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:30.724
ENMITY THAT IS PLAGUE IS

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:33.193
UNIVERSITY FOR FAR TOO LONG. WE

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.896
DO NOT NEED TO BE AT ODDS. AND

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:36.496
THERE IS A TABLE SOMEWHERE WE

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:39.800
CAN ALL SIT DOWN. AND I HOPE

01:45:39.866 --> 01:45:41.601
FOR MY FRIENDS OF THE REGION'S

01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:42.135
OR THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:45.439
UNIVERSITY. THEY WILL TAKE THIS

01:45:45.505 --> 01:45:48.642
NOT AS SOME REVIEW. BUT AS A

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:50.177

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:53.413

01:46:13.533 --> 01:46:15.869
FOR THE CALIFORNIA AND IT HAD

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:17.537
CERTAINLY TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:19.172
THERE I ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY

01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:21.908
HAVE NOTS HOWEVER I SERVED AS A

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:23.877
FACULTY MEMBER AT THE

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:24.911
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I DON'T

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:26.313
KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:28.315
SERVED ON IS AFFECTING THEIR

01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:30.250
FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER AT THE

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:31.485
MERCY CALIFORNIA. AFFECTED BEEN

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.053
TOLD US OF FIRST FULL TIME

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.621
FACULTY MEMBER UC'S EVER BEEN

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:35.989
ELECTED TO THE STATE

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:38.859
LEGISLATURE BUT IF SOMEONE FIND

01:46:38.925 --> 01:46:41.962
SOMEONE ELSE LET ME KNOW AND I

01:46:42.028 --> 01:46:46.032
STAND SUPPORT. ACTUALLY FOR.

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:47.300
BOTH AS A FORMER FACULTY MEMBER

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:49.903
AND ALSO AS A PHYSICIAN BECAUSE

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:50.504
I KNOW MANY PEOPLE BROUGHT UP

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:52.973
THE HEALTH SYSTEMS. SO

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:54.674
CERTAINLY AS A FACULTY MEMBER I

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:57.177
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

01:46:57.244 --> 01:47:00.280
WE TEACH OUR STUDENTS. AND SET

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.682
A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR THEM AS TO

01:47:02.749 --> 01:47:04.951
HOW WE DO BUSINESS. AT OUR

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:08.054
STATE RUN UNIVERSITY OUR STATE

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:10.323
UNIVERSITY OUR PREMIER THAT

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.924
CROWN JEWEL WE CALL DIVERSITY

01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:13.994
CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHAT KIND OF

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:17.631
EXAMPLE. ARE WE SETTING OUR

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:21.001
STUDENTS WHEN THE UNIVERSITY.

01:47:21.067 --> 01:47:25.038
DECIDES TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:26.239
REPLACING THE CONTRACT WORKERS

01:47:26.306 --> 01:47:28.742
OR EVEN HIGHER CONTRACT WORKERS

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:30.977
INSTEAD OF EXPANDING THEIR

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:36.116
EMPLOYMENT WORKFORCE. THE. NOW

01:47:36.183 --> 01:47:38.385
CERTAINLY THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

01:47:38.451 --> 01:47:39.719
THERE ARE TEMP YELP AND THERE

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:41.755
IT'S OUTLINED HERE THAT YOU MAY

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:44.157
HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:44.991
A CERTAIN EVENT OR SOMETHING

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:45.859
WHERE YOU MAY NEED SOME

01:47:45.926 --> 01:47:48.361
FLEXIBILITY BUT I THINK IT IS

01:47:48.428 --> 01:47:50.230
IMPORTANT THAT WE TEACH OUR

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:52.332
STUDENTS AND THE LEARNERS WHO

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:54.868
ARE AT THE MERCY CALIFORNIA HOW

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:57.404
ONE CAN DO BUSINESS AND YES WE

01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:59.372
HEAR IS THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE

01:47:59.439 --> 01:47:59.873
A RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.843
SUPPORT. OUR UNIVERSITY IN A

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:03.443
WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ADHERE

01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:05.512
TO THE VALUES. I DO APPRECIATE

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.514
THAT MY GOOD FRIEND TO STOCKING

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:08.582
THE BILL FROM SANTA CLARITA HAS

01:48:08.648 --> 01:48:10.116
POINTED OUT THAT ACTUALLY THE

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:12.285
FINANCIAL COST. IS ACTUALLY

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.821
BEARABLE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY.

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:16.623
AND SO I DO THINK AS A FACULTY

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:19.092
MEMBER. WHO WANTS TO NOT ONLY

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:21.928
JUST TEACH. MY LEARNERS THROUGH

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:27.667
LECTURES ARE OTHER EDUCATIONAL.

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:29.402
ALL ACT. THAT WE SHOULD SET

01:48:29.469 --> 01:48:31.071
THAT EXAMPLE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.772
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THIS

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:33.340
IDEA OF EQUITY. BECAUSE WHAT

01:48:33.406 --> 01:48:37.410
THIS. MANY DOES AND MANY OF YOU

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:38.745
SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT BY THE

01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:39.346
WAY I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:40.814
SAID WELL IS THERE A RUSH TO

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:42.515
JUDGMENT HERE. I MEAN THIS IS

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.217
AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR A LONG

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:45.886
TIME I MEAN THROUGHOUT MY

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:46.920
ENTIRE TIME THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:48.788
BEFORE EVER GOT THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:50.156
WENT. BEFORE SOME OF YOU ARE IN

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:51.258
THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE I WAS IN

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:52.459
THE LEGISLATURE I MEAN THIS IS

01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:54.060
NOT A RUSH TO JUDGMENT THIS IS

01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:55.495
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:56.863
FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND I

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:58.164
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:48:58.231 --> 01:49:00.066
SET THAT EXAMPLE NOW I KNOW

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:01.668
THAT MANY PEOPLE ALSO RAISE THE

01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:03.503
ISSUE ABOUT THE MED CENTER'S.

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.739
AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND-

01:49:05.805 --> 01:49:07.540
OTHER POSITION YOU PRACTICED

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:08.942
NOT ONLY OUTPATIENT BUT ALSO

01:49:09.009 --> 01:49:10.443
INFORMATION I DID YOU KNOW THE

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:12.245
WORD ATTENDING THAT OTHER

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:13.813
THINGS. AND BELIEVE ME YES I

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.950
AGREE. THE IT GOES UP THE ****

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:18.618
OUT IN TERMS OF THE DEMANDS

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:20.587
RIGHT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:23.690
THAT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:27.360
LIMITATION ANY CAPACITY IF SOME.

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.962
NO MAJOR EVENT HAPPENS IS NOT

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:29.896
JUST STAFF. ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY

01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:30.530
THAT'S ONE PLACE IT'S ACTUALLY

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:32.465
THE FACILITY ITSELF. AND SO WE

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:33.566
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:36.603
THAT ACTUALLY THE- UC HOSPITALS

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:37.804
WE THOUGHT TALK ABOUT ME EVER

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:39.806
VERY SPECIALTY PROGRAMS. THOSE

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:40.573
ARE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.642
SUFFERING THE LARGE SWINGS IN

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:44.344
DEMAND OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:45.979
THE MERCHANTS YOU ROOM THERE'S

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:47.881
A DISASTER OR SOMETHING. RIGHT

01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:50.283
WE DO HAVE FIRST OF ALL PLANS

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.884
AND THAT INVOLVES ACTUALLY THE

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:53.620
EXISTING STAFF. SO THERE THERE

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:56.289
IS ANY WE'RE WE ACTUALLY DO

01:49:56.356 --> 01:49:58.491
PLAN FOR AND ORGANIZED TO

01:49:58.558 --> 01:50:00.694
HANDLE VARIATIONS IN PATIENT

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.330
VOLUME INCLUDING EVEN. THINGS

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.731
TO HAPPEN TO THE VIRGIN THREW

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:05.966
ME OFF THERE IS A SCHOOL BUS

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:07.701
ACCIDENTS WE HAVE WE ARE WE ARE

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:10.070
ORGANIZED TO RESPOND TO THAT

01:50:10.136 --> 01:50:12.806
WITH EXISTING STAFF NOW. THERE

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:14.808
IS MENTION IN THE AC ITSELF THE

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:15.709
SAYS IF THERE'S ACTUALLY A

01:50:15.775 --> 01:50:18.144
LARGE SCALE EMERGENCY THE

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:21.348
GOVERNOR CAN DECLARE AND WEAK

01:50:21.414 --> 01:50:22.615
AND THE UNIVERSITY CAN'T PULL

01:50:22.682 --> 01:50:25.285
IN MORE PEOPLE TO DO THAT THE

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:26.252
HANDLE THAT AS WELL SO

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:28.254
CERTAINLY IF THERE IS THERE IS

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:30.490
IT IS A LARGE SCALE EVENTS

01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:32.625
WHERE WE DO NEED. TO BRING IN

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:33.793
MANY MORE PEOPLE INTO THE

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:37.397
FACILITY THERE IS THAT CAPACITY

01:50:37.464 --> 01:50:41.434
AS WELL. SO. NOW MAYBE THERE

01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:42.502
YOU KNOW MAYBE WE DO NEED TO

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:43.403
LEGISLATIVE FIX IF THIS IS

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.270
PASSED BY THE VOTERS AND POINT

01:50:44.337 --> 01:50:46.539
OUT THIS GOES TO THE VOTERS

01:50:46.606 --> 01:50:48.508
BUT- I'D- IT THIS IS NOT. A

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:50.744
THIS ACA IS NOT GOING TO

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.645
CRIPPLE. ARE YOU SEE HEALTH

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:53.446
SYSTEM TO SOMEONE WHO'S

01:50:53.513 --> 01:50:55.215
ACTUALLY WORKED THERE OKAY AND

01:50:55.281 --> 01:51:00.520
SO. I THINK THAT THIS

01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:01.688
RESOLUTIONS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:04.357
IT RESOLVES A PROBLEM THAT'S

01:51:04.424 --> 01:51:05.291
BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:08.495
AT UC. CLEARLY LIKE ANY

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:10.130
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IT'S

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:12.999
GONNA GO TO THE VOTERS BUT I AM

01:51:13.066 --> 01:51:15.935
ALSO PROUD OF THE FACT THAT. WE

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:18.471
CAN ALSO IT HAS THOSE SPACES

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:20.807
WITHIN THEIR FOR US TO FINE

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:21.875
TUNE THE PARTS THAT NEED TO BE

01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:24.577
FINE TUNED IN THERE BUT I THEY

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:26.146
DO WANT TO JUST SAY AGAIN I

01:51:26.212 --> 01:51:28.014
SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE

01:51:28.081 --> 01:51:29.783
AS BOTH A FACULTY MEMBER WE'D

01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:31.251
HAVE TO SET THE RIGHT EXAMPLE

01:51:31.317 --> 01:51:34.454
AND ALSO AS A PHYSICIAN I WANT

01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:36.056
TO SEE. OUR STAFF THE STAFF

01:51:36.122 --> 01:51:38.558
THAT'S ACTUALLY TAKING HELPING

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:40.860
US TAKE CARE TO PATIENTS. WE

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.128
NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE PEOPLE

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:44.030
WHO BOTH KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

01:51:44.097 --> 01:51:46.032

HAMMER IS GONNA AFFECT. AND.

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:44.450

HAVE ENOUGH MARINERS THAT CAN

01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:48.181
SET SAIL. THAT MEANS THAT THEY

01:54:48.248 --> 01:54:50.717
CANNOT CONDUCT THEIR RESEARCH.

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:52.018

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:27.387
SCRIPT DOES NOT HAVE THE

HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER CLIENTS

01:55:48.608 --> 01:55:51.711
THAT WILL. THE LOSS OF

EXPERTISE WILL FOR SCRIPTS TO

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:54.847
CUT BACK ON THE NUMBER OF SHIPS

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.916
IT SALES AND THE NUMBER OF

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:59.319
VOYAGES IT UNDERTAKES.

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:00.620
CONSEQUENTLY THE STORE SCRIPT

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:22.208
HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY I

STRONG SUPPORT AND I RISE AND

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:33.853
I'M EXCITED TO BE A CO AUTHOR

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:36.022
ON THIS BILL. I WANT TO REPEAT

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:37.423
SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:39.125
MADE WHEN WE HEARD THIS BILL IN

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:43.663
COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW WHO ARE WE

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:46.232
AS A GROUP WHO ARE WE AS

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:49.435
LEGISLATORS IF WE CAN ALLOW. A

01:56:49.502 --> 01:56:51.237
GROUP OF WORKERS TO BE TREATED

01:56:51.304 --> 01:56:53.673
AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. AND

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.842
THIS IS WHAT I SEE THIS AS IS.

01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:57.443
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE

01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:59.746
THE UNIVERSITIES RUN SURE WE

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:01.414
NEED THE TEACHERS SURE WE NEED

01:57:01.481 --> 01:57:03.282
ADMINISTRATORS BUT IF ALL THE

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:04.517
FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE GALLERY

01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:06.586
WITH US TODAY. AND THE HUNDREDS

01:57:06.652 --> 01:57:07.487
AND THOUSANDS OF MORE WHO

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:10.123
COULDN'T BE HERE DIDN'T SHOW UP

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:11.958
TO WORK EVERY DAY. THE UC'S

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:13.226
WOULD CLOSE THEY WOULDN'T BE

01:57:13.292 --> 01:57:15.161
ABLE TO RUN SO WHY IS IT THAT

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:17.296
WE DON'T VALUE THEM. LIKE WE

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:19.932
VALUE OTHER PEOPLE. AND ONE OF

01:57:19.999 --> 01:57:20.800
THE OTHER THINGS I THINK IS

01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:22.702
INTERESTING AND VERY CONCERNING

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:25.238
TO ME. IS THAT WE HAVE OUR

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:26.806
FUTURE LEADERS GETTING AN

01:57:26.873 --> 01:57:28.741
EDUCATION THERE AND WHAT ARE WE

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:30.643
TEACHING THEM ABOUT OTHER

01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:32.645
PEOPLE IF WE DON'T VALUE ALL

01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:35.281
WORK. THIS IS ABOUT VALUING ALL

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:37.283
WORK AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:39.786
WORKERS ARE PAID A LIVING WAGE.

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:41.454
FIRST ONE TO REPEAT OME OF

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:42.989
THINGS THAT I SAID. IN

01:57:43.055 --> 01:57:44.257
COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:46.192
IMPORTANT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:48.428
ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS I HEARD

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:49.729
I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE SAY

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:52.031
THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST WE'RE

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:53.065
DOING THIS AND IT SHOULD BE

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:55.301
COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED. BUT

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:56.202
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND

01:57:56.269 --> 01:57:57.270
SOMEONE COLLECT CORRECT ME IF

01:57:57.336 --> 01:57:59.305
I'M WRONG. THEY'VE BEEN

01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:01.407
NEGOTIATING FOR TWELVE YEARS SO

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:03.376
THAT'S OVER A DECADE THAT THIS

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:05.011
ISSUE HAS BEEN TRYING TO COME

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:06.679
TO RESOLUTION. I THINK THAT'S

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.448
MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME AND I

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:09.248
THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE DO

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:11.117
SOMETHING. WE TALK ABOUT

01:58:11.184 --> 01:58:13.386
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS BUT

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:14.387
WHAT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.556

SOMETHING FOR THEM THE PEOPLE

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.862
THAT MAKE SURE. OUR YOUNG MINDS

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:24.230
ARE ABLE TO COME TO THESE

01:58:24.297 --> 01:58:26.098

WE NEED TO PROTECTIONS OF THIS

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:26.157

OF US UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:31.062
INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE CAN BLUR

02:24:31.129 --> 02:24:34.899
THE LINES BETWEEN ADVOCACY AND

02:24:34.966 --> 02:24:37.435
OUTRIGHT MANIPULATION AND THE

LAST ELECTION IT WILL CAN OCCUR

02:24:55.853 --> 02:24:57.622
IN ALL FUTURE ELECTIONS SO I

02:24:57.688 --> 02:24:59.157
THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

02:24:59.223 --> 02:25:03.861
ESSENTIAL MY QUESTION TO THE

02:25:03.928 --> 02:25:08.266
FLOOR MANAGER ON THIS. IS. THE

02:25:08.332 --> 02:25:09.233

02:25:24.649 --> 02:25:25.416
LIKE THIS IF THERE WAS A

BROADCASTER WHATEVER. THEY

02:25:27.685 --> 02:25:28.886
WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THE

02:25:28.953 --> 02:25:30.388
PLAINTIFF IN THE CASE WHICH

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:31.322
WOULD NOT BE THE BROADCASTER

02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:33.091
THE NEWS MEDIA IT. WOULD HAVE

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:34.792
TO PUT WOULD HAVE TO PROVE.

02:25:34.859 --> 02:25:36.928
THAT THOSE WHO BROADCAST THIS

02:25:36.994 --> 02:25:38.563
OR PRINTED THIS DID SO WITH

02:25:38.629 --> 02:25:40.164
ACTUAL MALICE SO THE BURDEN

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:41.532

THE STANDARD IS ABOUT THE

02:25:42.467 --> 02:25:43.434
HIGHEST STANDARD YOU COULD

02:25:43.501 --> 02:25:45.002
MAKE. BECAUSE IT IS VERY

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:46.537
CHALLENGING THIS THIS WHOLE

02:25:46.604 --> 02:25:48.339
THING WE'VE GOT WHAT TECHNOLOGY

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:49.974
IS JUST MIND NUMBINGLY

02:25:50.041 --> 02:25:51.776
DIFFICULT. WHERE WE HAVE THESE

02:25:51.843 --> 02:25:53.544
VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES OF

FREE SPEECH BUT WE HAVE THEM

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:56.814

02:26:01.619 --> 02:26:02.687
FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DO IT SO

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:07.091
THIS APPEARS TO BE A PRETTY

02:26:07.158 --> 02:26:08.993
CAREFULLY CRAFTED AND NARROWER

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:09.894

THE INEVITABLE RESULT IF A. B.

SEVEN THIRTY WERE TO BECOME LAW

02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:23.201
WOULD BE A PROFOUND CHILLING

02:27:23.267 --> 02:27:24.835
EFFECT ON POLITICAL SPEECH THE

02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:27.238
VERY THING. THE FIRST AMENDMENT

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:30.007
WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT FOR

02:27:30.074 --> 02:27:32.843
THOSE REASONS SUPPORTING OUR

WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE. THE POINT

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:44.589
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE POINT

02:27:44.655 --> 02:27:45.122
ABOUT A CHILLING EFFECT IS

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:48.059
IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT THERE

02:27:48.125 --> 02:27:50.194
IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND

02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:51.929
THIS IS THE REAL CHALLENGE THAT

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:53.431
<u>E FACE WITH THESE NEW KINDS OF</u>

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:55.199
TECHNOLOGIES WE SAW THE SPEAKER

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:56.767
OF THE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON.

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:58.869
BEING COMPLETELY MANIPULATED

02:27:58.936 --> 02:28:00.004
THROUGH A VIDEO THREE MILLION

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:02.106
PEOPLE WATCH THAT AND IT LOOKED

02:28:02.173 --> 02:28:03.841
LIKE IT WAS ACCURATE AND TODAY

02:28:03.908 --> 02:28:04.809
THE TECHNOLOGY IS EVEN MORE

02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:07.812
SOPHISTICATED. AND SO THIS

02:28:07.878 --> 02:28:09.880
MEASURE HAS BEEN NARROWED IT IS

02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:11.682
BEST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN I

02:28:11.749 --> 02:28:13.050
THINK THAT ONE SHERMAN IN SKIS

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:14.685
A POINT OF VIEW THE DEAN OF THE

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:20.091
SAID IT BEST BECAUSE AND VERY

02:28:20.157 --> 02:28:22.693
SENSITIVE TO THOSE ISSUES. SO

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:23.661
THE ARGUMENT IS IN SO MANY OF

02:28:23.728 --> 02:28:24.328
THESE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT ON

02:28:24.395 --> 02:28:25.863
THIS FLOOR THE LAST NUMBERS

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:26.597
TODAY'S THESE DELICATE

02:28:26.664 --> 02:28:29.133
BALANCES. BALANCES IN TERMS OF

THE WAY THAT. NO ONE COULD EVER

02:28:38.743 --> 02:28:40.811

MANAGER PLEASE ENTER GLAZER WE

02:37:11.421 --> 02:37:14.024
TO QUESTION HAPPY TO YES. IS

02:37:14.091 --> 02:37:15.759
THERE ANY REVERSIONARY LANGUAGE

02:37:15.826 --> 02:37:18.228
THAT SHOULD A PURCHASER ASSUME

02:37:18.295 --> 02:37:20.998
TITLE THAT WOULD KEEP THEM FROM

02:37:21.064 --> 02:37:22.933
SELLING IT TO BY ANY OTHER

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.669
ENTITY. AND POCKETING THE FAIR

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:29.072
MARKET VALUE. I DON'T THINK

02:37:29.139 --> 02:37:30.307
THAT THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:37:30.374 --> 02:37:33.110
QUESTION THERE'S NO INTENTION

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:34.511
TO HAVE THAT BE THE CASE IT'S

02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:36.880
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A

02:37:36.947 --> 02:37:38.682
RULES IN WHICH WE DISPOSE OF

02:37:38.749 --> 02:37:40.350
SURPLUS PROPERTY THE STATE.

02:37:40.417 --> 02:37:41.852
PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TO

02:37:41.919 --> 02:37:43.754
GO TO A PUBLIC AGENCIES FIRST

02:37:43.821 --> 02:37:45.589
SO THE IDEA THAT IT COULD EVER

02:37:45.656 --> 02:37:47.191
BE USED FOR THAT TYPE OF

02:37:47.257 --> 02:37:48.292
ACTIVITY WOULD BE VERY LOW THIS

02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:52.229
IS RURAL LAND IS NOT URBAN LAND

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:53.397
THIS IS OUT IN THE HINTERLANDS

02:37:53.463 --> 02:37:56.633
OF. OF ALAMEDA COUNTY I DOES IT

02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:57.935
HAVE THE TRADITIONAL DEVELOPING

02:37:58.001 --> 02:37:59.469
RIGHTS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN THAT

02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:00.838
TYPE OF AREA SO I DON'T THINK

02:38:00.904 --> 02:38:03.473
THAT. ISSUE IS REALLY IN PLAY

02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:05.108
AND CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT

02:38:05.175 --> 02:38:08.412
COULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IF

02:38:08.478 --> 02:38:08.979
THEY WERE TO CHOOSE TO BUY.

02:38:09.046 --> 02:38:11.448
DECLARE THE LAND SURPLUS. ARE

02:38:11.515 --> 02:38:12.549
MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN

02:38:12.616 --> 02:38:14.885
YOU'RE DEALING WITH A- LAND

02:38:14.952 --> 02:38:17.754
LIKE THIS. THAT IF YOU'RE A-

02:38:17.821 --> 02:38:19.623
BASS LINE IS THE PURCHASE PRICE

02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:22.392
BUT IT'S- THAT'S TWENTY. YEARS

02:38:22.459 --> 02:38:25.395
DATED. WHY THEY WOULD BE USING

02:38:25.462 --> 02:38:27.698
THE FAIR MARKET VALUE TODAY.

02:38:27.764 --> 02:38:29.433
AND THE LAST WOULD BE A

02:38:29.499 --> 02:38:31.268
REVERSIONARY CLAUSE THAT THE

02:38:31.335 --> 02:38:32.636
PROPERTY OF SOLD TO A THIRD

02:38:32.703 --> 02:38:34.171
PARTY OR INTENT TO BE SOLD TO A

02:38:34.238 --> 02:38:35.572
THIRD PARTY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY

02:38:35.639 --> 02:38:37.941
REVERT TO THE STATE. OF IN OR

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:40.110
SOME SORT OF CONSERVANCY I

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:41.144
WOULD SAY THIS THAT IF THAT WAS

02:38:41.211 --> 02:38:43.113
EVER AN ISSUE I'VE CERTAINLY

02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:43.680
HAS MY COMMITMENT AND I'LL

02:38:43.747 --> 02:38:45.916
CHECK WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL.

02:38:45.983 --> 02:38:47.150
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WOULD

02:38:47.217 --> 02:38:48.285
NOT THAT'S NOT A PURPOSE OF

02:38:48.352 --> 02:38:49.119
WHAT THIS MEAN THAT MEASURE

02:38:49.186 --> 02:38:50.787
INTENDS TO DO AND WE CERTAINLY

02:38:50.854 --> 02:38:52.489
WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO BE THE

02:38:52.556 --> 02:38:53.690
RESULT OF A IT'S REALLY AN

02:38:53.757 --> 02:38:55.292
ATTEMPT TO. IF THEY DECIDE THE

02:38:55.359 --> 02:38:57.394
CONFLICT HAS GONE ON TOO LONG

02:38:57.461 --> 02:38:57.928
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

LITIGATION HAS GONE ON FOR TOO

02:38:59.429 --> 02:39:01.465
LONG. THAT THAT THERE'S A THAT

02:39:01.531 --> 02:39:02.699
IT CAN BE PRESERVED IN

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:07.671
CONSERVATION AND PERMANENTLY

02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:08.272
THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL TO GIVE

02:39:08.338 --> 02:39:08.839
THEM THAT OPTION. IF THEY SO

02:39:08.906 --> 02:39:13.877
CHOOSE. CENTER STONE. I THINK

02:39:13.944 --> 02:39:16.780

AFFILIATED GOES TO THE POINT.

03:00:21.277 --> 03:00:22.811
THAT WAS MADE IN THE

03:00:22.878 --> 03:00:25.681
PRESENTATION ABOUT THE

03:00:25.748 --> 03:00:26.282

EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. NOTHING

03:00:41.797 --> 03:00:43.732

SURE THERE'S NO CONFUSION IN

03:00:45.734 --> 03:00:48.170

03:00:58.747 --> 03:00:59.949
GEORGE WALLACE. I DON'T MAKE

PEOPLE KNEW THAT. AND KNEW WHAT

03:01:07.289 --> 03:01:08.390
THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF

03:01:08.457 --> 03:01:09.925
THAT PARTY WAS THAT USED THE

03:01:09.992 --> 03:01:11.260

ESSENCE OF THE BILL WE HAD A

03:03:39.775 --> 03:03:40.743
DISCUSSION EARLIER THIS MORNING

HAS TO BE APPLIED BY BOTH SIDES

I AM OBJECTING IS A POINT OF

03:03:52.121 --> 03:03:54.156
ORDER THAT THE DISCUSSION NOW

03:03:54.223 --> 03:03:56.492
IS FLAME THROWING AGAINST THE

03:03:56.558 --> 03:03:58.427
PARTY IN POWER IT IS NOT ABOUT

03:03:58.494 --> 03:04:00.629
THE ISSUE IN THE BILL ENTRY.

03:04:00.696 --> 03:04:03.532
BEFORE US TODAY AND IT'S THAT

03:04:03.599 --> 03:04:03.999
BASIS UPON WHICH I AM

03:04:04.066 --> 03:04:20.215
PROJECTION

03:04:25.687 --> 03:04:26.922
. THANK YOU. THE

03:04:26.989 --> 03:04:29.258
POINT OF ORDER IS WELL TAKEN

AND WE'RE STILL GONNA SHOULD

03:04:29.892 --> 03:04:30.392
REMAIN TO THE SUBJECT OF THE

03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:32.060
BILL. PRESIDENT I APOLOGIZE FOR

03:04:32.127 --> 03:04:36.064
THE. DISTURBANCE THAT I'VE

03:04:36.131 --> 03:04:37.032
CAUSED I DID NOT MEAN TO DO

03:04:37.099 --> 03:04:37.900
THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE A

03:04:37.966 --> 03:04:39.768
POINT OF CONCLUDE BY SAYING

03:04:39.835 --> 03:04:40.369
THAT THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT

03:04:40.436 --> 03:04:42.771
PARTY. HAS BEEN AROUND LONGER

03:04:42.838 --> 03:04:48.277
THAN MANY OF US HAVE BEEN ALIVE.

03:04:48.343 --> 03:04:51.113
I THINK IT'S A STRANGE TACTIC

03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:51.747
MISTER PRESIDENT I THINK IT'S A

03:04:51.814 --> 03:04:56.185
SHAME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:04:56.251 --> 03:04:58.320
THANK YOU ANY FURTHER

03:04:58.387 --> 03:04:58.921
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS

03:04:58.987 --> 03:05:03.759
ITEM YES. YES. CONSIDER BORDERS

03:05:03.826 --> 03:05:04.393
I CONCEDE SO YOU MIGHT THINK IT

03:05:04.460 --> 03:05:08.096
WAS PRESIDENT. I HAVE TO ADMIT.

03:05:08.163 --> 03:05:09.798
WHEN I LOOK AT PARTY

03:05:09.865 --> 03:05:12.601
DESIGNATIONS I GET CONFUSED.

03:05:12.668 --> 03:05:14.536
WHEN I SEE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT

03:05:14.603 --> 03:05:15.604
ARE THE INDEPENDENT IS IT SOME

03:05:15.671 --> 03:05:17.873
OTHER ORGANIZATION THE LOT OF

03:05:17.940 --> 03:05:20.209
THESE THINGS ARE MISLEADING AND

03:05:20.275 --> 03:05:20.809
WE HAD AN ISSUE NOT THAT LONG

03:05:20.876 --> 03:05:24.313
AGO ON. HOW DO WE PROTECT THE

03:05:24.379 --> 03:05:27.649
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS WELL

03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:30.752
STILL PRESERVING OUR- OUR OUR

03:05:30.819 --> 03:05:32.588
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR OR THE

03:05:32.654 --> 03:05:33.555
INTEGRITY OF THE VOTING

03:05:33.622 --> 03:05:36.658
PROCESS. IT SEEMS LIKE WE TRIED

03:05:36.725 --> 03:05:39.361
TO NEARLY TAILOR OUR SOLUTIONS.

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:42.531
BUT THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE THE

03:05:42.598 --> 03:05:43.131
OPPORTUNITY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

03:05:43.198 --> 03:05:47.069
MISSED. WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN.

03:05:47.135 --> 03:05:49.171
MORE HELPFUL TO PROTECT THE

03:05:49.238 --> 03:05:52.341
INTEGRITY OF OUR PROCESS BY

03:05:52.407 --> 03:05:54.209
REQUESTING OR EVEN MANDATING

03:05:54.276 --> 03:05:56.144
FOR THAT MATTER I DISCLOSURE ON

03:05:56.211 --> 03:05:58.547
ANY FORMS THAT SAYS THE

03:05:58.614 --> 03:06:01.817
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY IS.

03:06:01.884 --> 03:06:03.552
A PARTY THAT DOESN'T

03:06:03.619 --> 03:06:05.821
NECESSARILY IDENTIFY ITSELF AS

03:06:05.888 --> 03:06:07.990
INDEPENDENT OR SOME VARIATION

03:06:08.056 --> 03:06:10.859
THEREOF THAT INFORMS THE PUBLIC

03:06:10.926 --> 03:06:12.761
THAT THE TITLE THE READING MAY

03:06:12.828 --> 03:06:15.297
NOT BE IS AS ACCURATE AS THE

03:06:15.364 --> 03:06:18.166
LABEL THAT THEY'RE INTERPRETING.

03:06:18.233 --> 03:06:18.834
SO WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GETTING AT

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:20.102
WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT THERE

03:06:20.168 --> 03:06:22.905
IS A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM

03:06:22.971 --> 03:06:25.374
BUT THE BILL HERE. I DON'T

03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:28.143
THINK IT IS IT IS SATISFACTORY

03:06:28.210 --> 03:06:30.913
SO I GUESS I'M ALL ALLEN HERE

03:06:30.979 --> 03:06:33.448
THAT THIS IS IT THIS COULD BE

03:06:33.515 --> 03:06:36.585
THE RIGHT STEP FORWARD BUT IT'S

03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:37.185

RECENT LEGISLATION AS WELL. THE

03:11:31.847 --> 03:11:33.148
REASON THAT THE CDA IS OFF IS

03:11:33.215 --> 03:11:36.585
BECAUSE- THE BILL STATES THAT

03:11:36.651 --> 03:11:37.586
IF YOU HAVE A BRAND NEW VEHICLE

03:12:06.181 --> 03:12:08.884
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:10.218
ADDITIONALLY IF YOUR CHECK

03:12:10.285 --> 03:12:13.054
ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. YOU'RE

03:12:13.121 --> 03:12:15.056

ACT TO GO GET IT CHECKED BUT I

03:12:18.426 --> 03:12:20.328
WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT

03:12:20.395 --> 03:12:22.097
THERE ARE LIKE A HUNDRED AND

03:12:22.163 --> 03:12:24.733
FIFTY SENSORS. ON THESE TRUCKS.

03:12:24.799 --> 03:12:26.434
NOW ON THE MOST RECENT TRUCK

03:12:26.501 --> 03:12:29.237
THAT I. HAVE PURCHASED. I'VE

03:12:29.304 --> 03:12:31.406
HAD IT TO THE SHOP SEVERAL

03:12:31.473 --> 03:12:32.007
TIMES BECAUSE I'VE HAD A CHECK

03:12:32.073 --> 03:12:34.376
ENGINE LIGHT ON. IN THE TRUCK

03:12:34.442 --> 03:12:36.978
SEEM TO BE PERFORMING WELL. BUT

03:12:37.045 --> 03:12:37.545
IT'S THE SENSOR ITSELF THAT

03:12:37.612 --> 03:12:42.117
GOES OUT. FROM SIX HUNDRED TO A

03:12:42.183 --> 03:12:43.585
THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THE BILL

03:12:43.652 --> 03:12:44.452
EVERY TIME I HAVE TO GO IN AND

03:12:44.519 --> 03:12:47.022
HAVE THAT CHECKED OUT. NOW THE

03:12:47.088 --> 03:12:49.157
TRUCK I USED TO OWN THE OLDER

03:12:49.224 --> 03:12:50.325
TRUCKS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

03:12:50.392 --> 03:12:53.295
WORK ON OURSELVES AND RUN FOR

03:12:53.361 --> 03:12:55.196
YEARS WITHOUT TAKING THEM TO

03:12:55.263 --> 03:12:57.632
THE DEALERS. DID NOT HAVE AIR

03:12:57.699 --> 03:12:58.867
QUALITY STANDARDS WE HAVE TODAY

03:12:58.934 --> 03:13:01.169
OBVIOUSLY. BUT THE TECHNOLOGY

03:13:01.236 --> 03:13:03.238
NOW IT'S CHANGED. BECAUSE THAT

03:13:03.305 --> 03:13:05.073
TECHNOLOGIES CHANGED WE DON'T

03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:06.274
HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

03:13:06.341 --> 03:13:08.376
WORK ON OUR- VEHICLES AS YOU

03:13:08.443 --> 03:13:11.579
DON'T YOUR OWN CARS. AND SO THE

03:13:11.646 --> 03:13:12.547
DEALERS ARE ALL FOR THIS

03:13:12.614 --> 03:13:14.349
BECAUSE WHAT DOES IT DO IT IT

03:13:14.416 --> 03:13:16.451
REQUIRES YOU TO GO IN AND MANY

03:13:16.518 --> 03:13:17.752
OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED

03:13:17.819 --> 03:13:19.587
THAT. IF YOU HAVE A CAR THAT

03:13:19.654 --> 03:13:20.789
HOUSE THE SENSORS THAT TELL YOU

03:13:20.855 --> 03:13:22.557
HOW MUCH AIR IS IN THE IN THE

03:13:22.624 --> 03:13:25.493
TIRES IT COMES ON YOUR- DASH

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:26.461
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT INTO

03:13:26.528 --> 03:13:28.496
THE TIRE SHOP. AND MANY TIMES

03:13:28.563 --> 03:13:29.764
IT MAY BE JUST A COLD MORNING

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:31.466
BECAUSE IT CAN DEBTS ARE A HOT

03:13:31.533 --> 03:13:33.702
DAY WHERE YOU'RE TRAVELING OR

03:13:33.768 --> 03:13:36.638
THE SENSOR GOES OUT. THEY'RE

03:13:36.705 --> 03:13:37.539
REQUIRED BY LAW TO NOT LEAVE

03:13:37.605 --> 03:13:39.374
THAT THAT VEHICLE LEAVE WITHOUT

03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:41.876
THOSE CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS ALL.

03:13:41.943 --> 03:13:43.445
WHICH DRIVES ACOSTA FOR

03:13:43.511 --> 03:13:44.779
EVERYBODY EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST

03:13:44.846 --> 03:13:46.681
SIMPLY A SENSOR THERE'S NOTHING

03:13:46.748 --> 03:13:48.016
WRONG SAFETY WISE YOU CAN TAKE

03:13:48.083 --> 03:13:50.385
A GAUGE AND CHECK YOUR TIRE AND

03:13:50.452 --> 03:13:52.387
MANY TIMES ON THE TRUCKS. THE

03:13:52.454 --> 03:13:54.689
SENSOR IS THE PROBLEM ITSELF

03:13:54.756 --> 03:13:55.290
IT'S NOT THE PROBLEM WITH THE

03:13:55.357 --> 03:13:56.224
TRUCK SO THIS IS GOING TO

03:13:56.291 --> 03:13:59.494
IMPACT. SMALL OPERATORS MORE

03:13:59.561 --> 03:14:02.130
THAN IT IS THE BIG OPERATORS

03:14:02.197 --> 03:14:04.232
AND IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS THE-

03:14:04.299 --> 03:14:05.700
PROMOTE MORE CELLS OF TRUCKS

03:14:05.767 --> 03:14:07.502
AND THAT'S WHY THE DEALERS AND

03:14:07.569 --> 03:14:09.471
THOSE GUYS ARE HAPPY ABOUT IT

03:14:09.537 --> 03:14:11.840
BUT THEY IT'S GOING TO DRIVE

03:14:11.906 --> 03:14:13.041
THE COST UP OF TRANSPORTATION

03:14:13.108 --> 03:14:14.843
COSTS IN CALIFORNIA. UP IN

03:14:14.909 --> 03:14:16.011
THERE IS IN A MINUTE IN THE

03:14:16.077 --> 03:14:18.713
BILL TO THE WHICH I THINK IS A

03:14:18.780 --> 03:14:20.081
GOOD PART OF THE BILL WHICH I

03:14:20.148 --> 03:14:21.449
WILL SAY IS THAT IT REQUIRES

03:14:21.516 --> 03:14:25.520
pWITH CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH WILL

03:14:25.587 --> 03:14:26.788
HELP US BE A LITTLE MORE

03:14:26.855 --> 03:14:27.989
COMPARED BUT THE END OF THE

03:14:28.056 --> 03:14:29.624
DAY. THE SMALL GUYS GOING TO

03:14:29.691 --> 03:14:31.292
GET HURT AND IT'S GOING TO

03:14:31.359 --> 03:14:32.527
DRIVE THE COST UP OF LIVING IN

03:14:32.594 --> 03:14:36.831

BILLION DOLLARS OF FACILITIES.

04:20:44.462 --> 04:20:45.963
INDEED THERE WILL BE SOME DEBT

04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:47.098
BURDEN AND I THINK WHAT WAS

04:20:47.164 --> 04:20:48.966
INDICATED BY TO HEAR MILLION

04:20:49.033 --> 04:20:49.934
DOLLARS A YEAR IS PROBABLY

04:20:50.001 --> 04:20:52.036
PRETTY ACCURATE. AND WE NOW

04:20:52.103 --> 04:20:55.706
HAVE EIGHTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS

04:20:55.773 --> 04:20:56.307
IN STATE AND LOCAL FUNDING FOR

04:20:56.374 --> 04:20:58.509
SCHOOLS. BUT IS EVERY MEMBER IN

04:20:58.576 --> 04:21:01.579
THIS SENATE. AND I THINK MOST

04:21:01.645 --> 04:21:04.382
MEMBERS A CALIFORNIA UNDERSTAND

04:21:04.448 --> 04:21:04.982
THAT EDUCATION IS THE CORE OF

04:21:05.049 --> 04:21:08.052
UPWARD MOBILITY. TO THE MATTER

04:21:08.119 --> 04:21:09.353
IS THAT ARE YOU PEOPLE FOOT

04:21:09.420 --> 04:21:11.856
SPENDING IN K. TO TWELVE IS WAY

04:21:11.922 --> 04:21:13.958
BELOW WHAT IT SHOULD BE. THE

04:21:14.025 --> 04:21:15.192
NOTION OF MODERNIZING

04:21:15.259 --> 04:21:17.361
FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

04:21:17.428 --> 04:21:18.129
ENGAGED IN IS SOMETHING THAT IS

04:21:18.195 --> 04:21:20.264
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN

04:21:20.331 --> 04:21:21.165
IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT A SMALL

04:21:21.232 --> 04:21:23.801
BURDEN OF DEBT WHAT BETTER

04:21:23.868 --> 04:21:26.270
PLACE TO DO THAT THEN FOR

04:21:26.337 --> 04:21:28.172
EDUCATION FOR UPWARD MOBILITY

04:21:28.239 --> 04:21:29.707
FOR PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES

04:21:29.774 --> 04:21:30.841
WHEN YOU LOOK AT EVERY

04:21:30.908 --> 04:21:32.243
ECONOMIST LEFT TO RIGHT

04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:33.177
WHEREVER HEY ARE ON THIS

04:21:33.244 --> 04:21:35.012
POLITICAL SPECTRUM IT IS ALL

04:21:35.079 --> 04:21:36.480
ABOUT EDUCATION IS THE CORE WE

04:21:36.547 --> 04:21:38.049
TALK ABOUT IT. IN THE

04:21:38.115 --> 04:21:39.183
OPPORTUNITY TODAY WITH

04:21:39.250 --> 04:21:40.551
MODERNIZING THESE FACILITIES

04:21:40.618 --> 04:21:42.119
WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

04:21:42.186 --> 04:21:43.421
THINGS THAT WE NEVER DREAMED OF

04:21:43.487 --> 04:21:45.823
BEFORE. IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY

04:21:45.890 --> 04:21:47.591
SO THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO

04:21:47.658 --> 04:21:49.693
DO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF

04:21:49.760 --> 04:21:52.730

04:23:13.344 --> 04:23:15.946
GROWING ENROLLMENT. THROUGHOUT

HIGHER EDUCATION. HISTORICALLY

HAVE THE CAPABILITY. TO COME UP

04:23:35.499 --> 04:23:36.033
WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

04:23:36.100 --> 04:23:38.068
IS REQUIRED. FOR K. TWELVE

04:23:38.135 --> 04:23:40.271
EDUCATION. THAT HIGHER

04:23:40.337 --> 04:23:45.609
EDUCATION. AND THE PREVIOUS

04:23:45.676 --> 04:23:48.779
BOND THAT HAD BEEN PASSED.

04:23:48.846 --> 04:23:49.413
BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL PLIGHT

04:23:49.480 --> 04:23:52.683
OF THE STATE. PRIOR

04:23:52.750 --> 04:23:53.250
ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN A

04:23:53.317 --> 04:23:55.186
LITTLE TIGHT. AND GETTING MONEY

04:23:55.252 --> 04:23:58.822
OUT. THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH A

04:23:58.889 --> 04:24:01.859
LONG TROUGH. WITHOUT HAVING

04:24:01.926 --> 04:24:04.962
ANOTHER BONTA FOR US. AND

04:24:05.029 --> 04:24:06.497
WITHOUT HAVING SUFFICIENT MONEY

04:24:06.564 --> 04:24:09.300
TO KEEP UP. ALLOCATED BY THAT

04:24:09.366 --> 04:24:13.971
BOARD. NOW IS MORE TIME IN A

04:24:14.038 --> 04:24:17.141
TIMELY THAN EVER. BECAUSE THE

04:24:17.208 --> 04:24:22.246
NEED IS GREATER. WE ALL ARE

04:24:22.313 --> 04:24:23.714
SENSITIVE TO THE BONDED

04:24:23.781 --> 04:24:25.549
INDEBTEDNESS OF CALIFORNIA BUT

04:24:25.616 --> 04:24:27.818
THAT IS NOT A PRODUCT I ARGUE

04:24:27.885 --> 04:24:29.253
UP K. TWELVE EDUCATION OR

04:24:29.320 --> 04:24:31.121
HIGHER EDUCATION CONSTRUCTION

04:24:31.188 --> 04:24:34.091
ETCETERA BONDS. IT IS A

04:24:34.158 --> 04:24:36.827
PLETHORA OF BONDS THAT WE HAVE

04:24:36.894 --> 04:24:37.361
LACKED FOR MANY MANY OTHER

04:24:37.428 --> 04:24:40.497
PURPOSES. FAR LESS IMPORTANT IN

04:24:40.564 --> 04:24:44.635
EDUCATION. THEN I SAY IN THESE

04:24:44.702 --> 04:24:46.770
TIMES WE HAVE GOT TO HARKEN. TO

04:24:46.837 --> 04:24:50.374
THE HIGHEST OF PRIORITIES. AND

04:24:50.441 --> 04:24:52.443
THIS MOST ASSUREDLY SHOULD

04:24:52.509 --> 04:24:55.312
REMAIN OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. WE

04:24:55.379 --> 04:24:58.082
CANNOT SACRIFICE THOSE

04:24:58.148 --> 04:25:00.918
INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES NEEDS

04:25:00.985 --> 04:25:02.620
FOR OTHER OTHER FIVE OR TEN

04:25:02.686 --> 04:25:04.488
YEARS WHICH IS WHAT WE WILL

04:25:04.555 --> 04:25:06.423
INDOOR IF WE DO NOT. PASS THIS

04:25:06.490 --> 04:25:10.794
MEASURE. AND THEN ENCOURAGE OUR

04:25:10.861 --> 04:25:12.896
CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO

04:25:12.963 --> 04:25:15.366

OF OUR YOUTH. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

04:25:17.835 --> 04:25:20.671

I'M SEEING REPEATEDLY IS THIS

04:36:22.132 --> 04:36:25.302
IDEA THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

04:36:25.368 --> 04:36:28.004

04:36:28.071 --> 04:36:29.773

05:31:43.316 --> 05:31:45.385
FAVOR OF WORKING PEOPLE BECAUSE

05:31:45.452 --> 05:31:47.721
WE DO SO MUCH FOR CORPORATIONS

05:31:47.787 --> 05:31:49.489
WE WANT CORPORATIONS TO BE

05:31:49.556 --> 05:31:51.858
SUCCESSFUL ABSOLUTELY BUT WE

05:31:51.925 --> 05:31:53.393
ALSO WANT THEM TO SHARE THEIR

05:31:53.460 --> 05:31:55.996
MONEY AND THEIR PROFITS WITH

05:31:56.062 --> 05:31:56.630
THE PEOPLE. THAT PUSH THE MONEY

05:31:56.696 --> 05:31:59.032
UP TO THEM. WE KNOW THAT

05:31:59.099 --> 05:32:01.067
EARLIER THIS YEAR ACTIONS LAST

05:32:01.134 --> 05:32:02.102
YEAR THE PRESIDENT OF THE

05:32:02.168 --> 05:32:06.072
UNITED STATES. GRANTED A TAX

05:32:06.139 --> 05:32:09.109
CUTS TO CORPORATIONS. AND WE

05:32:09.175 --> 05:32:10.944
WERE ALL TOLD THAT THAT TAX CUT

05:32:11.011 --> 05:32:13.613
WOULD TRICKLE DOWN TO WORKERS

05:32:13.680 --> 05:32:15.548
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED WE

05:32:15.615 --> 05:32:16.716
KNOW THAT THESE CORPORATIONS

05:32:16.783 --> 05:32:18.952
TOOK THAT MONEY AND PLOWED BACK

05:32:19.019 --> 05:32:20.320
INTO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND THE

05:32:20.387 --> 05:32:23.189
BOARD MEMBERS. I JUST WANT TO

05:32:23.256 --> 05:32:23.790
GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF

05:32:23.857 --> 05:32:24.524
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WITH

05:32:24.591 --> 05:32:27.327
THAT MONEY CVS COULD HAVE GIVEN

05:32:27.394 --> 05:32:28.828
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR

05:32:28.895 --> 05:32:30.597
WORKERS AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

05:32:30.664 --> 05:32:33.466
DOLLAR RAISE BUT THEY DIDN'T

05:32:33.533 --> 05:32:34.434
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN

05:32:34.501 --> 05:32:37.203
YOU MAKE MINIMUM WAGE EIGHTEEN

05:32:37.270 --> 05:32:37.971
THOUSAND DOLLARS IS LIFE

05:32:38.038 --> 05:32:39.939
CHANGING THAT CAN KEEP SOMEONE

05:32:40.006 --> 05:32:42.108
OUT OF LOSING APARTMENT. THAT

05:32:42.175 --> 05:32:43.376
CAN MOVE A FAMILY OUT OF A ONE

05:32:43.443 --> 05:32:45.912
BEDROOM HOME APARTMENT INTO A

05:32:45.979 --> 05:32:47.881
THREE BEDROOM APARTMENT. HOME

05:32:47.947 --> 05:32:49.482
DEPOT COULD HAVE ALSO GIVEN

05:32:49.549 --> 05:32:51.384
EACH ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND

05:32:51.451 --> 05:32:52.252
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR RACE

05:32:52.319 --> 05:32:54.621
BUT THEY DIDN'T MCDONALD'S

05:32:54.688 --> 05:32:55.655
COULD HAVE GIVEN EVERYONE OF

05:32:55.722 --> 05:32:58.391
THEIR WORKERS WORLDWIDE A FOUR

05:32:58.458 --> 05:33:00.260
THOUSAND DOLLAR REYES AND THAT

05:33:00.327 --> 05:33:01.661
DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THE MONEY

05:33:01.728 --> 05:33:03.630
NEVER TRICKLES DOWN TO THE

05:33:03.697 --> 05:33:05.098
WORKERS THE MONEY STAYS WITH

05:33:05.165 --> 05:33:07.233
THE CORPORATIONS AND STAYS WITH

05:33:07.300 --> 05:33:08.802
THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD

05:33:08.868 --> 05:33:11.037

LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT HAS TO

05:33:14.474 --> 05:33:16.443
DO WITH LOCKED OUT WORKERS THIS

05:33:16.509 --> 05:33:18.011
IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE

05:33:18.078 --> 05:33:20.013
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I WAS A

05:33:20.080 --> 05:33:24.517
LABOR UNION BOSS FOR MANY YEARS

LOVE REPRESENTING WORKERS

05:33:27.220 --> 05:33:28.788

REPRESENT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE

05:33:39.399 --> 05:33:41.501
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. WE KNEW

05:33:41.568 --> 05:33:43.670
THAT BARGAINING WAS GOING TO BE

05:33:43.737 --> 05:33:45.438
DIFFERENT WITH THE GROCERY

05:33:45.505 --> 05:33:47.941
STORES ARE WE REPRESENTED THE

05:33:48.007 --> 05:33:49.008
THREE BIG CORPORATIONS

05:33:49.075 --> 05:33:52.812
ALBERTSONS RALPHS VONS. SO WHAT

05:33:52.879 --> 05:33:54.381
WE DID AS THEY WERE UNION

05:33:54.447 --> 05:33:56.549
BOSSES IS WE WENT OUT AND SPOKE

05:33:56.616 --> 05:33:57.617
TO ALL OF OUR MEMBERS AND WE

05:33:57.684 --> 05:33:58.551
SAID HE SENT THESE ARE GOING TO

05:33:58.618 --> 05:34:02.655
BE. TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS. WHAT

05:34:02.722 --> 05:34:10.163
YOU BE READY. RIGHT NOW YOU PAY

05:34:10.230 --> 05:34:11.431
NOTHING YOUR HEALTHCARE YOU'RE

05:34:11.498 --> 05:34:11.998
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO START

05:34:12.065 --> 05:34:12.565
PAYING A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR

05:34:12.632 --> 05:34:13.166
COPAY. AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER

05:34:13.233 --> 05:34:13.733
SAID THEY SAID WE GET IT WE

05:34:13.800 --> 05:34:14.367
KNOW THIS WAS BEFORE OBAMACARE

05:34:14.434 --> 05:34:15.168
THIS IS BEFORE WE SAW INCREASES

05:34:15.235 --> 05:34:17.003
OR DECREASES IN HEALTH CARE.

05:34:17.070 --> 05:34:17.570
THIS IS WHEN WE WERE AT THE

05:34:17.637 --> 05:34:18.138
BARGAINING TABLE AND WE WERE

05:34:18.204 --> 05:34:20.140
SEEING. DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES

05:34:20.206 --> 05:34:21.007
IN HEALTH CARE. THE WORKERS

05:34:21.074 --> 05:34:22.308
UNDERSTOOD AND THEY SAID WE'RE

05:34:22.375 --> 05:34:24.511
READY WE'LL DO WHAT WE NEED TO

05:34:24.577 --> 05:34:25.111
DO WERE HAPPY TO PAY A LITTLE

05:34:25.178 --> 05:34:28.081
BIT MORE. WHAT WE COULDN'T KNOW

05:34:28.148 --> 05:34:31.484
AS A NION AT THAT TIME. WAS AT

05:34:31.551 --> 05:34:32.852
THESE THREE CORPORATIONS WERE

05:34:32.919 --> 05:34:34.654
PLANNING A STRIKE. THEY WERE

05:34:34.721 --> 05:34:35.789
PLAYING TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE

05:34:35.855 --> 05:34:37.624
TABLE THAT WOULD BE SO

05:34:37.690 --> 05:34:39.859
DETRIMENTAL TO THESE WORKERS.

05:34:39.926 --> 05:34:40.827
THAT WOULD LEAVE THEM NO CHOICE

05:34:40.894 --> 05:34:43.630
BUT TO GO ON STRIKE. BUT WE MET

05:34:43.696 --> 05:34:45.165
WITH THIRTY NINE BARGAINING

05:34:45.231 --> 05:34:48.201
SESSIONS WITH THESE EMPLOYERS.

05:34:48.268 --> 05:34:49.402
AND AFTER THIRTY NINE

05:34:49.469 --> 05:34:51.070
BARGAINING SESSIONS.

05:34:51.137 --> 05:34:53.473
UNFORTUNATELY WE CALLED A

05:34:53.540 --> 05:34:54.541
STRIKE AND THE MEMBERS AT ALL

05:34:54.607 --> 05:34:57.343
VOTED ON THIS. AND WHAT PEOPLE

05:34:57.410 --> 05:34:57.911
WHO DON'T WORK IN THE LABOR

05:34:57.977 --> 05:35:00.079
MOVEMENT DON'T KNOW. IS THAT

05:35:00.146 --> 05:35:00.547
WHEN YOU HAVE A MULTI

05:35:00.613 --> 05:35:03.750
BARGAINING. UNIT YOU HAVE EACH

05:35:03.817 --> 05:35:05.218
UNIT VOTE TO GO ON STRIKE BUT

05:35:05.285 --> 05:35:06.553
THAT UNIT DOESN'T KNOW WHICH

05:35:06.619 --> 05:35:07.487
ONE OF THEM THE STRIKE MIGHT BE

05:35:07.554 --> 05:35:09.255
CALLED AGAINST. AND WE MAKE

05:35:09.322 --> 05:35:10.657
THAT DECISION AT THE BARGAINING

05:35:10.723 --> 05:35:12.058
TABLE AND IT'S USUALLY THE

05:35:12.125 --> 05:35:13.760
EMPLOYER THAT'S THE WORST AT

05:35:13.827 --> 05:35:15.361
THE TABLE IN THIS CASE IT WAS

05:35:15.428 --> 05:35:17.530
VAUGHN'S UP HERE IT'S SAFE WAY.

05:35:17.597 --> 05:35:19.098
AND THE REASON THEY WERE THE

05:35:19.165 --> 05:35:20.200
WORST IS BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE

05:35:20.266 --> 05:35:22.101
AT THE TABLE. SOME OF THE

05:35:22.168 --> 05:35:23.102
COMMENTS THEY MADE WERE

05:35:23.169 --> 05:35:25.872
COMMENTS LIKE THIS I'LL NEVER

05:35:25.939 --> 05:35:26.439
FORGET THIS WOMAN SU ROAD

05:35:26.506 --> 05:35:28.508
CHECK. AND SHE SAID. IT'S NOT

05:35:28.575 --> 05:35:29.742
THAT WE DON'T WANT THAT WE

05:35:29.809 --> 05:35:31.978
CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE PAY RAISES

05:35:32.045 --> 05:35:33.213
WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE PAY

05:35:33.279 --> 05:35:35.381
RAISES BECAUSE A MONKEY COULD

05:35:35.448 --> 05:35:36.683
DO THE JOB OF ALL OF OUR

05:35:36.749 --> 05:35:40.987
EMPLOYEES. YOU IMAGINE THAT

05:35:41.054 --> 05:35:41.554
TELLING YOU THINKING OF YOUR

05:35:41.621 --> 05:35:45.291
EMPLOYEES AS MONKEYS. SO WE

05:35:45.358 --> 05:35:46.125
CALLED THE STRIKE AGAINST

05:35:46.192 --> 05:35:48.862
BONDS. ON OCTOBER SIXTH THIRD

05:35:48.928 --> 05:35:49.929
OF OCTOBER ELEVENTH OF TWO

05:35:49.996 --> 05:35:52.765
THOUSAND THREE. I WITHIN TWELVE

05:35:52.832 --> 05:35:55.201
HOURS ALBERTSONS AND RALPH HAD

05:35:55.268 --> 05:35:57.170
LOCKED OUT ALL OF THE WORKERS

05:35:57.237 --> 05:35:58.338
THEY RETALIATED AGAINST THEIR

05:35:58.404 --> 05:36:01.207
WORKERS. AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR

05:36:01.274 --> 05:36:02.308
HOURS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE

05:36:02.375 --> 05:36:02.876
PICKET LINES HAVE BEEN

05:36:02.942 --> 05:36:04.611
ESTABLISHED IN SOUTHERN

05:36:04.677 --> 05:36:05.979
CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WOULD

05:36:06.045 --> 05:36:08.214
ULTIMATELY BE THE LONGEST AND

05:36:08.281 --> 05:36:11.017
MOST CUT COSTLY STRIKE IN THE

05:36:11.084 --> 05:36:14.120
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.

05:36:14.187 --> 05:36:16.256
THE THREE CEOS BIRD DILLON AND

05:36:16.322 --> 05:36:18.458
JOHNSTON PUT OUT LETTERS TO ALL

05:36:18.525 --> 05:36:20.159
OF THEIR WORKERS AND THEY SAID

05:36:20.226 --> 05:36:23.062
WE DON'T CARE STRIKE AS LONG AS

05:36:23.129 --> 05:36:23.663
YOU WANT. THE OFFER WILL NEVER

05:36:23.730 --> 05:36:26.799
GET BETTER. BUT WE KEPT HOPE

05:36:26.866 --> 05:36:29.068
ALIVE THE OFFER WOULD GET

05:36:29.135 --> 05:36:31.371
BETTER AND AS THE DAYS AND THE

05:36:31.437 --> 05:36:34.007
WEEKS AND THE MONTHS WORE ON.

05:36:34.073 --> 05:36:35.141
IT GOT HARDER AND HARDER PEOPLE

05:36:35.208 --> 05:36:37.343
LOST THEIR CARS PEOPLE LOST

05:36:37.410 --> 05:36:39.879
THEIR HOMES. IN THE THIRD MONTH

05:36:39.946 --> 05:36:41.481
OF THE STRIKE MEMBERS RAN OUT

05:36:41.548 --> 05:36:43.449
OF THEIR BENEFITS SO FOR ALL OF

05:36:43.516 --> 05:36:44.617
US WHO ARE HEALTHY THAT WAS

05:36:44.684 --> 05:36:46.819
OKAY. BUT FOR THE WORKERS WERE

05:36:46.886 --> 05:36:49.422
BATTLING CANCER CANCER I WILL

05:36:49.489 --> 05:36:51.791
NEVER FORGET THE I'LL W. YOU

05:36:51.858 --> 05:36:52.792
THE LONGSHOREMEN'S UNION

05:36:52.859 --> 05:36:54.994
STEPPED UP. THEY FOUND OUT

05:36:55.061 --> 05:36:56.763
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER WHO HAD

05:36:56.829 --> 05:36:58.398
CANCER AND THEY PAID THEIR

05:36:58.464 --> 05:36:59.866
HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS TO MAKE

05:36:59.933 --> 05:37:01.801
SURE THAT THEY WOULDN'T LOSE

05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:03.202
THEIR MEDICAL BENEFITS WHILE

05:37:03.269 --> 05:37:04.837
THEY WERE BATTLING CANCER. BUT

05:37:04.904 --> 05:37:06.673
YOU KNOW WHAT DISTRICT IT

05:37:06.739 --> 05:37:07.874
BLINDED COME DOWN THE PICKET

05:37:07.941 --> 05:37:10.009
LINES DID COME DOWN BECAUSE THE

05:37:10.076 --> 05:37:12.111
OFER DID GET BETTER. ON

05:37:12.178 --> 05:37:14.847
FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTH OF TWO

05:37:14.914 --> 05:37:15.481
THOUSAND FOUR AFTER FOUR AND A

05:37:15.548 --> 05:37:17.684
HALF MONTHS THIS PICK THE

05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:20.753
PICKET LINES CAME DOWN. IT'S

05:37:20.820 --> 05:37:21.588
STILL SOMETIMES HARD FOR ME TO

05:37:21.654 --> 05:37:22.188
TALK ABOUT IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL

05:37:22.255 --> 05:37:24.891
BECAUSE NO ONE GOES ON STRIKE

05:37:24.958 --> 05:37:25.758
UNLESS THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE

05:37:25.825 --> 05:37:27.961
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE TO DO.

05:37:28.027 --> 05:37:29.996
OUR THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT

05:37:30.063 --> 05:37:31.264
PEOPLE DON'T GIVE UP THEIR

05:37:31.331 --> 05:37:34.968
WAGES BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK

05:37:35.034 --> 05:37:35.568
THAT THEY JUST KNOW THERE'S NO

05:37:35.635 --> 05:37:36.169
OTHER WAY OUT THEIR BACKS ARE

05:37:36.235 --> 05:37:38.438
TO THE WALL. I LOOK AT THE

05:37:38.504 --> 05:37:41.908
SEVENTY THOUSAND WORKERS. FIFTY

05:37:41.975 --> 05:37:42.442
THOUSAND OF THEM WHO WERE

05:37:42.508 --> 05:37:44.310
LOCKED OUT OF SOME OF THE

05:37:44.377 --> 05:37:46.079
BRAVEST PEOPLE I WILL EVER

05:37:46.145 --> 05:37:47.747
KNOW. AND AFTER THE STRIKE WAS

05:37:47.814 --> 05:37:49.282
OVER WHAT THE COMPANY SAID TO

05:37:49.349 --> 05:37:53.486
US WAS. WE PLAN TO TAKE A HIT

05:37:53.553 --> 05:37:54.754
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BREAK THE

05:37:54.821 --> 05:37:56.422
UNION. AND WHAT I NEVER

05:37:56.489 --> 05:37:58.358
UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THAT STATEMENT

05:37:58.424 --> 05:38:00.460
IS WHEN YOU BREAK THE UNION ME

05:38:00.526 --> 05:38:01.361
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION

05:38:01.427 --> 05:38:03.262
YOU'RE NOT BREAKING ME. YOU'RE

05:38:03.329 --> 05:38:06.432
TRYING TO BREAK ALL THE WORKERS

05:38:06.499 --> 05:38:08.534
EVERY DAY AND MAKE MONEY IF

05:38:08.601 --> 05:38:09.936
THOSE WORKERS DON'T SHOW UP TO

05:38:10.003 --> 05:38:11.070
WORK THESE CORPORATIONS DON'T

05:38:11.137 --> 05:38:12.572
MAKE ANY MONEY. SO WHEN YOU

05:38:12.639 --> 05:38:13.740
WANT TO BREAK THE UNION YOU'RE

05:38:13.806 --> 05:38:15.642
NOT HARMING ME YOU'RE HARMING

05:38:15.708 --> 05:38:16.743

SECTOR. HAVING TWENTY THOUSAND.

05:40:49.529 --> 05:40:53.399
UNION MEMBERS. AND WHILE I WAS

05:40:53.466 --> 05:40:54.934

THE CITY OF TEMECULA. NEVER HAD

05:40:56.702 --> 05:41:02.008
ONE STRIKE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

05:41:02.074 --> 05:41:03.342
CONTRARY TO MY RHETORIC IN

05:41:03.409 --> 05:41:06.479
COMMENTS AND MARKING THE UNION

05:41:06.546 --> 05:41:09.649
CAUCUS THIS PAST WEEK I'VE HAD

05:41:09.715 --> 05:41:11.918
A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH

05:41:11.984 --> 05:41:14.587
LABOR AND MY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS

05:41:14.654 --> 05:41:16.556
OF BEING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.

05:41:16.622 --> 05:41:18.558
AND IN MY YEARS OF OWNING MY

05:41:18.624 --> 05:41:20.359

05:41:20.426 --> 05:41:22.962
EMPLOYEES WITH VERY LITTLE TURN

05:41:23.029 --> 05:41:23.496
AROUND. BECAUSE THERE WILL

05:41:23.563 --> 05:41:26.199
TAKING CARE OF. BUT MY FRIENDS

05:41:26.265 --> 05:41:27.767
I MUST RESPECTFULLY RISE IN

05:41:27.834 --> 05:41:30.536
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. MY

05:41:30.603 --> 05:41:31.537
WORRY IS THAT PROVIDING

05:41:31.604 --> 05:41:33.606
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO

05:41:33.673 --> 05:41:34.207
EXISTING WORKERS WHO CHOOSE TO

05:41:34.273 --> 05:41:37.210
GO ON STRIKE. WE WOULD BE

05:41:37.276 --> 05:41:38.978
REMOVING AN INCENTIVE FOR THE

05:41:39.045 --> 05:41:40.179
EMPLOYEES TO COME TO THE

05:41:40.246 --> 05:41:42.782
BARGAINING TABLE AND NEGOTIATE

05:41:42.849 --> 05:41:44.617
IN GOOD FAITH FOR THE MORE.

05:41:44.684 --> 05:41:47.053
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS NOT

05:41:47.119 --> 05:41:47.520
FOR WORKERS THAT HAVE

05:41:47.587 --> 05:41:51.357
VOLUNTARILY LEFT A JOB. AB TEN

05:41:51.424 --> 05:41:53.192
SIXTY SIX GOES BEYOND THAT. AND

05:41:53.259 --> 05:41:55.061
PROVIDES THESE BENEFITS TO

05:41:55.127 --> 05:41:57.730
WORKERS THAT ARE STILL EMPLOYED.

05:41:57.797 --> 05:41:59.332
UNIONS ALREADY PLANNED FOR

05:41:59.398 --> 05:42:00.466

05:42:00.533 --> 05:42:02.268
STRIKING MEMBERS WITH STRIKING

05:42:02.335 --> 05:42:05.137
ACCOUNTS FUNDED BY UNION DUES

05:42:05.204 --> 05:42:05.671
WHICH ALWAYS GETTING MORE

05:42:05.738 --> 05:42:07.506
EXPENSIVE AND NEVER COMING

05:42:07.573 --> 05:42:10.343
DOWN. AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.

05:42:10.409 --> 05:42:11.611
WELL I WILL ADMIT THAT THIS IS

05:42:11.677 --> 05:42:13.212
A CREATIVE WAY FOR UNIONS TO

05:42:13.279 --> 05:42:14.347
ELIMINATE THE NEED TO CREATE A

05:42:14.413 --> 05:42:15.581
RESERVE FOR THE STRIKING

05:42:15.648 --> 05:42:17.483
MEMBERS. THEREBY FREEING UP

05:42:17.550 --> 05:42:19.785
MUCH OF THEIR NEEDED FUNDS I

05:42:19.852 --> 05:42:21.454
JUST DON'T BELIEVE. THE

05:42:21.520 --> 05:42:24.123
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM

05:42:24.190 --> 05:42:26.025
WAS ESTABLISHED TO BOOST THE

05:42:26.092 --> 05:42:29.061
COFFERS OF UNIONS. THIS IN ALL

05:42:29.128 --> 05:42:32.465
LIKELIHOOD. AS MANY AS OF THE

05:42:32.531 --> 05:42:33.799
OTHER PIECES OF UNION

05:42:33.866 --> 05:42:35.067
LEGISLATION THAT WE SEEN THIS

05:42:35.134 --> 05:42:37.703
PAST WEEK. IS IN RESPONSE TO

05:42:37.770 --> 05:42:39.171
THE JANICE DECISION AND I KNOW

05:42:39.238 --> 05:42:40.273
THE UNIONS ARE UPSET ABOUT THE

05:42:40.339 --> 05:42:42.742
CHANCE DECISION. AND THIS IS A

05:42:42.808 --> 05:42:44.443
WAY. FOR THEM TO TRY TO

05:42:44.510 --> 05:42:47.680
OVERCOME. THEIR DISDAIN. FOR

05:42:47.747 --> 05:42:51.317
THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION.

05:42:51.384 --> 05:42:54.120
AGAIN LET'S RESERVE OUR

05:42:54.186 --> 05:42:54.754
EMPLOYMENT FUNDS FOR THOSE THAT

THEIR JOBS OR BEEN TERMINATED.

05:43:00.192 --> 05:43:00.693

06:59:29.377 --> 06:59:31.412
WE KNOW IN THE RESEARCH CLEARLY

06:59:31.479 --> 06:59:33.681
SHOWS THAT IT CAN TAKE DECADES

06:59:33.748 --> 06:59:36.251
FOR MOST VICTIMS TO BE READY TO

06:59:36.317 --> 06:59:38.219
COME FORWARD TO ACTUALLY EVEN

06:59:38.286 --> 06:59:40.355
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS EVENT

06:59:40.421 --> 06:59:41.789

IS THEN WHEN THEY COME FORWARD

06:59:55.336 --> 06:59:57.539
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE STATUTE

06:59:57.605 --> 07:00:00.408
DOES ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO

07:00:00.475 --> 07:00:05.380
SEEK REDRESS. SO THIS DENIES

07:00:05.446 --> 07:00:06.581
JUSTICE TO VICTIMS IT ALLOWS

07:00:06.648 --> 07:00:07.682

07:34:24.437 --> 07:34:26.105
WATER FUTURE FOR THE STATE

EVERYBODY. NOT JUST GROUPS AND

07:34:31.811 --> 07:34:32.345
NOT JUST WATER FOR FISH WATER

07:34:32.411 --> 07:34:36.916
FOR EVERYBODY. IN ALL SPECIES.

07:34:36.983 --> 07:34:40.653
THIS WILL NOT GET US THERE. IT

07:34:40.720 --> 07:34:44.223
IS ILL FOUNDED. A ROLL BACK THE

07:34:44.290 --> 07:34:46.626
PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. AND

07:34:46.692 --> 07:34:48.794
HERE WE GO REIGNITING. THE

07:34:48.861 --> 07:34:57.570
WATER WARS. ANY ADDITIONAL.

07:34:57.637 --> 07:34:58.771

MANY OF US GOOD. COULD FIND

07:35:09.181 --> 07:35:11.651
ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE

07:35:11.717 --> 07:35:14.520
PROVISIONS IN THIS LEGISLATION

07:35:14.587 --> 07:35:16.856
SOUL ARE PROBABLY JUST PICK ONE

07:35:16.922 --> 07:35:19.025
OR TWO. F. I MADE DIRECT

07:35:19.091 --> 07:35:24.730
QUESTIONS TO. THE AUTHOR.

07:35:24.797 --> 07:35:27.099
SENATOR ACTIONS WE TAKE

07:35:27.166 --> 07:35:30.269
QUESTION YES THE ABORTION SO

07:35:30.336 --> 07:35:31.003
REPRESENTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY

07:35:31.070 --> 07:35:32.972
I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE

07:35:33.039 --> 07:35:34.006
IMPASSIONED WORDS OF MY

07:35:34.073 --> 07:35:36.375
COLLEAGUE WATERS A VERY

07:35:36.442 --> 07:35:38.644
SIGNIFICANT DYNAMIC IN OUR

07:35:38.711 --> 07:35:39.445
REGION FOR OBVIOUS OBVIOUS

07:35:39.512 --> 07:35:41.514
REASONS. IN ONE OF THE THINGS

07:35:41.580 --> 07:35:43.849
THAT WE'VE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT

07:35:43.916 --> 07:35:47.253
TIME DEALING WITH IS OF COURSE

07:35:47.319 --> 07:35:51.724
THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. AND

07:35:51.791 --> 07:35:52.792
ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN HERE

07:35:52.858 --> 07:35:54.093
THAT CONCERNS ME GREATLY IS THE

07:35:54.160 --> 07:35:59.198
IDEA THAT. THE FISH AND GAME

07:35:59.265 --> 07:36:02.201
COMMISSION COULD ADOPT

07:36:02.268 --> 07:36:06.839
REGULATIONS THAT ADD SPECIES TO

07:36:06.906 --> 07:36:10.476
THAT ARE ON THE ENDANGERED LIST.

07:36:10.543 --> 07:36:12.178
BETTER FEDERAL ACTION RESULTS

07:36:12.244 --> 07:36:13.112
IN A DECREASE OF PROTECTION SO

07:36:13.179 --> 07:36:14.780
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WOULD IT

07:36:14.847 --> 07:36:20.252
NOT BE. EFFECTIVE TO MONITOR

07:36:20.319 --> 07:36:23.222
THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS BY

07:36:23.289 --> 07:36:25.825
BRING BACK ANY STATUTORY

07:36:25.891 --> 07:36:28.427
REQUEST THAT DOESN'T CREATE A

07:36:28.494 --> 07:36:29.628
BASELINE AS THIS PIECE

07:36:29.695 --> 07:36:33.766
LEGISLATION DOES. GIVEN THE

07:36:33.833 --> 07:36:36.402
SMELLED ISSUE THE SALMON ISSUE

07:36:36.469 --> 07:36:38.270
THE DYNAMIC AND THE CHANGING IN

07:36:38.337 --> 07:36:41.841
THE EVOLVING SCIENCE THAT THIS

07:36:41.907 --> 07:36:44.176
KIND OF FREEZES IN TIME WOULD

07:36:44.243 --> 07:36:45.745
NOT BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO BRING

07:36:45.811 --> 07:36:48.714
BACK ANY THESE CONSIDERATIONS

07:36:48.781 --> 07:36:52.218
TO THE LEGISLATURE RATHER THAN.

07:36:52.284 --> 07:36:56.722
ARE CREATING A BASELINE. THE

07:36:56.789 --> 07:36:58.591
WAY THIS LEGISLATION IS

07:36:58.657 --> 07:36:59.325
PROPOSED THANK YOU FOR THE

07:36:59.391 --> 07:37:01.293
QUESTION AND ADD TO MY

07:37:01.360 --> 07:37:02.595
COLLEAGUES THERE WERE MANY MANY

07:37:02.661 --> 07:37:04.663
AMENDMENTS I IN IN. THE PROCESS

07:37:04.730 --> 07:37:07.366
OF SIX POLICY HEARINGS INTO

APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES WE

07:37:10.736 --> 07:37:12.872
SOUGHT TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF

07:37:12.938 --> 07:37:15.207
THOSE CONCERNS THE BASELINE HI

07:37:15.274 --> 07:37:16.408
I MEAN WE ARE NOT CHANGING

07:37:16.475 --> 07:37:18.744
REGULATIONS WE ARE ADOPTING THE

07:37:18.811 --> 07:37:20.980
BASELINE WE'VE ADDED LANGUAGE

07:37:21.046 --> 07:37:23.382
IN THE BILL. TO ADDRESS THE

07:37:23.449 --> 07:37:25.451
BEST POSSIBLE SCIENCE THAT IS

07:37:25.518 --> 07:37:26.252
THE CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN

07:37:26.318 --> 07:37:28.354
EXPRESSED AGAIN AND AGAIN WE

07:37:28.420 --> 07:37:30.689
ADDED THAT INTO THE LANGUAGE OF

07:37:30.756 --> 07:37:33.192
THE BILL AT THE REQUEST AS WE

07:37:33.259 --> 07:37:35.361
DID. NEGOTIATIONS THROUGH THE

07:37:35.427 --> 07:37:40.599
PROCESS. FISHING GAME HIS GIVEN

07:37:40.666 --> 07:37:42.802
DISCRETION BUT IT THEY HAVE TO

07:37:42.868 --> 07:37:44.036
GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY

07:37:44.103 --> 07:37:47.406
PROCESS TO DO ANY CHANGE WE ARE

07:37:47.473 --> 07:37:49.575
TRYING TO HAVE A BASELINE SET

07:37:49.642 --> 07:37:51.677
OF STANDARDS WE ALSO TALKED

07:37:51.744 --> 07:37:53.646
ABOUT INTO MY OTHER COLLEAGUES.

07:37:53.712 --> 07:37:54.847
THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT

07:37:54.914 --> 07:37:55.915
AGREEMENTS WHICH GETS TO THE

07:37:55.981 --> 07:37:58.751
ISSUE OF YOUR THE BOTTOM LINE

07:37:58.818 --> 07:37:59.418
OF YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS

07:37:59.485 --> 07:38:02.388
WATER. THIS BILL DOESN'T IMPACT

07:38:02.454 --> 07:38:04.657
THE VOLUNTARY CELL AGREEMENTS

07:38:04.723 --> 07:38:06.659
WE PUT IT INTO THE INTO THE

07:38:06.725 --> 07:38:17.303
LANGUAGE OF. THE BILL IT IS SO.

07:38:17.369 --> 07:38:19.171
WE REALLY AND TRULY DID WORK IN

07:38:19.238 --> 07:38:20.739
GOOD FAITH TO TRY TO ADDRESS

07:38:20.806 --> 07:38:22.141
THOSE CONCERNS. IT'S FOR IN

07:38:22.208 --> 07:38:24.577
TERMS OF THE DISCRETION THAT

07:38:24.643 --> 07:38:26.145
FISH AND GAME. IS GIVEN IT'S

07:38:26.212 --> 07:38:27.913
FROZEN UNTIL FISHING GAME IS

07:38:27.980 --> 07:38:29.148
ABLE TO REVIEW IT'S NOT

07:38:29.215 --> 07:38:31.517
PERMANENT SO WE ARE CONTINUING

07:38:31.584 --> 07:38:32.151
TO DO THE REVIEW THAT'S NEEDED

07:38:32.218 --> 07:38:33.986
TO BE DONE. AND WE ARE TRYING

07:38:34.053 --> 07:38:34.453
TO PUT INTO PLACE THE

07:38:34.520 --> 07:38:36.522
PROTECTIONS THAT YOU HAVE

07:38:36.589 --> 07:38:37.056
OUTLINED IN TERMS OF THE

07:38:37.122 --> 07:38:40.359
VOLUNTARY SELL AGREEMENT. AS IT

07:38:40.426 --> 07:38:41.927
RELATES ALSO TO THE ENDANGERED

07:38:41.994 --> 07:38:46.799
SPECIES ACT LET ME MAKE MAY BE

07:38:46.866 --> 07:38:47.399
HELPFUL FOLLOW UP ON THIS IF I

07:38:47.466 --> 07:38:52.238
MAN MISTER PRESIDENT. WHEN I

07:38:52.304 --> 07:38:53.505
FIRST MOVED TO WHEN I FIRST

07:38:53.572 --> 07:38:54.807
MOVED TO FRESNO I HAD THE

07:38:54.874 --> 07:38:56.075
OPPORTUNITY TO CLERK. FOR A

07:38:56.141 --> 07:38:57.509
FEDERAL JUDGE WHO IS REGARDED

07:38:57.576 --> 07:39:00.512
NATIONALLY AS- THE WATER JUDGE.

07:39:00.579 --> 07:39:01.547
IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

07:39:01.614 --> 07:39:03.315
EXPERIENCED WHEN WE WENT

07:39:03.382 --> 07:39:04.984
THROUGH ALL THE LITIGATIONS

07:39:05.050 --> 07:39:06.385
INVOLVING. THE ENDANGERED

07:39:06.452 --> 07:39:09.321
SPECIES ACT WAS THE BIOLOGICAL

07:39:09.388 --> 07:39:12.725
OPINIONS. AND WHAT WE REALIZE

07:39:12.791 --> 07:39:14.693
OVER TIME IS THAT THE GREAT

07:39:14.760 --> 07:39:16.295
LATITUDE THE REGULATORY

07:39:16.362 --> 07:39:18.564
AUTHORITIES HAVE IN DETERMINING

07:39:18.631 --> 07:39:19.598
THEIR INTERPRETATION OF

07:39:19.665 --> 07:39:21.800
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WHICH IS

07:39:21.867 --> 07:39:23.802
WHY THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS

07:39:23.869 --> 07:39:26.372
SPENT YEARS LOBBYING. THE

07:39:26.438 --> 07:39:29.408
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TO RE VISIT

07:39:29.475 --> 07:39:33.979
THEIR SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION.

07:39:34.046 --> 07:39:35.748
AND IT IS. UNFORTUNATELY COME

07:39:35.814 --> 07:39:36.849
TO LITTLE AVAIL BUT WHAT I'M

07:39:36.916 --> 07:39:40.085
CONCERNED MOST ABOUT THIS IS

07:39:40.152 --> 07:39:41.387
THAT IF WE DO SUCCEED AT THE

07:39:41.453 --> 07:39:44.023
FEDERAL LEVEL WE WILL THEN LOSE

07:39:44.089 --> 07:39:47.259
AGAIN AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND

07:39:47.326 --> 07:39:48.861
THAT IS WHAT I'M TERRIBLY

07:39:48.928 --> 07:39:49.895
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THIS

07:39:49.962 --> 07:39:51.897
LEGISLATION IS THAT WE HAVE

07:39:51.964 --> 07:39:54.900
FOUGHT FOR A DECADE OR MORE

07:39:54.967 --> 07:39:55.501
TRYING TO GET THEM TO

07:39:55.567 --> 07:39:58.737
UNDERSTAND. THAT THE HUMAN

07:39:58.804 --> 07:40:02.141
ELEMENT IS A KEY COMPONENT IN

07:40:02.207 --> 07:40:04.610
UNDERSTANDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL

07:40:04.677 --> 07:40:07.479
CONCERNS WHEREAS BEFORE IT WAS

07:40:07.546 --> 07:40:08.447
ONLY ABOUT LET'S SAY A DELTA

07:40:08.514 --> 07:40:10.816
SMELT. BUT WE WERE TRYING TO

07:40:10.883 --> 07:40:11.850
MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS A

07:40:11.917 --> 07:40:13.986
HUMAN ELEMENT THAT WAS

07:40:14.053 --> 07:40:14.620
CALCULATED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL

07:40:14.687 --> 07:40:20.059
IMPACT. SO NOW AFTER A DECADE A

07:40:20.125 --> 07:40:20.592
DECADE OF FIGHTING AT THE

07:40:20.659 --> 07:40:21.961
FEDERAL LEVEL WE COULD VERY

07:40:22.027 --> 07:40:23.996
WELL SEE OURSELVES WINNING IN

07:40:24.063 --> 07:40:25.831
WASHINGTON AND THEN LOSING IN

07:40:25.898 --> 07:40:28.934
CALIFORNIA. IN I DON'T KNOW

07:40:29.001 --> 07:40:33.038
WHAT. JUST TO COME HERE AND SAY

07:40:33.105 --> 07:40:34.640
WE SHOULD OPPOSE THIS I THINK

07:40:34.707 --> 07:40:38.444
IS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC I THINK

07:40:38.510 --> 07:40:40.446
THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE DEEP

07:40:40.512 --> 07:40:46.952
SYSTEMIC AND FUNDAMENTAL BY

07:40:47.019 --> 07:40:48.287
BY VIRTUE OF THAT BASELINE ON

07:40:48.354 --> 07:40:50.689
DOES ALL THE POLITICAL WORK

07:40:50.756 --> 07:40:51.824
THAT WE HAVE SEEN AT THE

07:40:51.890 --> 07:40:53.659
FEDERAL LEVEL THAT COULD BE OF

07:40:53.726 --> 07:40:55.327
GREAT VALUE TO THE AGRICULTURAL

07:40:55.394 --> 07:40:57.830
INDUSTRY AND IN ALL THOSE

07:40:57.896 --> 07:41:00.032
INTERESTED PARTIES INVOLVING

07:41:00.099 --> 07:41:04.103
THE WATER WARS. SO ALL IN ALL

07:41:04.169 --> 07:41:09.008
IN MY COMMENT MY COMMENTS HERE.

07:41:09.074 --> 07:41:09.608
WITH ONE LAST QUESTION TO YOU

07:41:09.675 --> 07:41:12.011
IF I MAY. THERE WAS IN THE

07:41:12.077 --> 07:41:12.978
MEDIA REPORTS THAT DEMOCRAT

07:41:13.045 --> 07:41:14.680
FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES

07:41:14.747 --> 07:41:17.116
FEINSTEIN IN OTHERS HAD

07:41:17.182 --> 07:41:18.784
EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

07:41:18.851 --> 07:41:21.620
SB ONE. HAVE YOU ADDRESS THOSE

07:41:21.687 --> 07:41:22.588
CONCERNS OR DO YOU HAVE A

07:41:22.654 --> 07:41:26.358
RESPONSE TO. THE LETTER THAT

07:41:26.425 --> 07:41:26.859
WAS SENT TO YOUR OFFICE

WELL HI I WOULD SAY. THE

07:41:35.701 --> 07:41:38.470
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE

07:41:38.537 --> 07:41:41.106
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OUR AS

07:41:41.173 --> 07:41:45.711
IT RELATES TO WATER FLOWS AND

07:41:45.778 --> 07:41:47.880
THE VOLUNTARY SETTLE AGREEMENTS

07:41:47.946 --> 07:41:49.915
HAS BEEN LONG AND DISCUSSION

07:41:49.982 --> 07:41:52.017
AND SETTLED AT AT THE STATE

07:41:52.084 --> 07:41:55.220
LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL

07:41:55.287 --> 07:41:55.621
UNTIL WE GOT A NEW

07:41:55.687 --> 07:42:00.225
ADMINISTRATION. THESE ARE THESE

07:42:00.292 --> 07:42:00.826
ARE PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

07:42:00.893 --> 07:42:04.797
IN PLACE FOR. FORTY YEARS SO I

07:42:04.863 --> 07:42:10.869
WILL SAY. WE A THE BUT THE

07:42:10.936 --> 07:42:14.139
POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE

07:42:14.206 --> 07:42:16.642
TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES

07:42:16.708 --> 07:42:18.944
THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE

07:42:19.011 --> 07:42:21.713
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS ROLLING

07:42:21.780 --> 07:42:22.848
OUT THAT WE HAVE LIVED UNDER

07:42:22.915 --> 07:42:25.084
FOR QUITE AWHILE. OUR DELEGATE

07:42:25.150 --> 07:42:26.418
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THAT

07:42:26.485 --> 07:42:28.587
OUR REPRESENTATIVES AT THE

07:42:28.654 --> 07:42:29.855
FEDERAL LEVEL AND OUR

07:42:29.922 --> 07:42:31.757
DELEGATION THAT WANT TO SEE

07:42:31.824 --> 07:42:34.126
THOSE STANDARDS ROLLED BACK TO

07:42:34.193 --> 07:42:35.861
THIS IS WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE

07:42:35.928 --> 07:42:37.763
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AT

07:42:37.830 --> 07:42:40.332
THE STATE TO PROTECT SOME

07:42:40.399 --> 07:42:40.866
ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THE

07:42:40.933 --> 07:42:44.336
DELTA ECO SYSTEM. I DON'T SEE

07:42:44.403 --> 07:42:46.105
THAT YOU FIND THIS ISSUE BEING

07:42:46.171 --> 07:42:47.739
DETERMINED ALONG POLITICAL

07:42:47.806 --> 07:42:50.609
LINES IT'S DETERMINED ALONG

07:42:50.676 --> 07:42:53.011
SOME GEOGRAPHICAL LINES AS IT

07:42:53.078 --> 07:42:54.713
RELATES TO THE ISSUES AND

07:42:54.780 --> 07:42:58.016
CONCERNS ABOUT WATER FLOWS. SO

07:42:58.083 --> 07:43:00.052
WE HAVE DEBATED THESE ISSUES

07:43:00.119 --> 07:43:01.086
TIME AND TIME AGAIN AT THE

07:43:01.153 --> 07:43:05.891
STATE LEVEL. AND SO I DO

07:43:05.958 --> 07:43:11.797
BELIEVE THAT. THIS IS AN

07:43:11.864 --> 07:43:13.198
ATTEMPT TO ROLLBACK.

07:43:13.265 --> 07:43:13.765
PROTECTIONS THAT WE PUT IN

07:43:13.832 --> 07:43:15.501
PLACE FOR OUR NATURAL RESOURCES

07:43:15.567 --> 07:43:16.835
ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES SO THAT

07:43:16.902 --> 07:43:18.570
IS THE POINT OF A LARGE PART OF

07:43:18.637 --> 07:43:26.712
THIS LEGISLATION. I EIGHT

07:43:26.778 --> 07:43:28.213
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND

07:43:28.280 --> 07:43:30.015
DEMOCRATS DON'T ALWAYS AGREE I

07:43:30.082 --> 07:43:31.917
MEAN IF IT IF IT IS A POLITICAL

07:43:31.984 --> 07:43:32.885
IF YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS A

07:43:32.951 --> 07:43:34.486
POLITICAL THING AGAIN SEE

07:43:34.553 --> 07:43:36.755
ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY IT

07:43:36.822 --> 07:43:39.024
ISN'T IT IS ABOUT. THE

07:43:39.091 --> 07:43:39.591
PROTECTION IMMIGRANT RIGHTS

07:43:39.658 --> 07:43:46.098
DISAGREE. HI AND IN TERMS OF

07:43:46.165 --> 07:43:48.200
ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE RATHER

07:43:48.267 --> 07:43:50.169
THAN HAVE CROSSED DEBATE. I

07:43:50.235 --> 07:43:51.670
WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE VERY

07:43:51.737 --> 07:43:53.305
REASON THIS LEGISLATION IS

07:43:53.372 --> 07:43:56.041
NECESSARY IS TO PROTECT. OUR

07:43:56.108 --> 07:43:59.111
RESOURCES AND MAYBE FIVE THERE

07:43:59.178 --> 07:44:02.147
ARE OF POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

07:44:02.214 --> 07:44:04.316
BY DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

07:44:04.383 --> 07:44:05.450
WHO DISAGREE BUT THESE THINGS

07:44:05.517 --> 07:44:08.053
HAVE BEEN DEBATED. OF FOR WELL

07:44:08.120 --> 07:44:09.655
OVER FORTY YEARS IN TERMS OF

07:44:09.721 --> 07:44:11.823
CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER OUR

07:44:11.890 --> 07:44:13.192
NATURAL RESOURCES THE

07:44:13.258 --> 07:44:15.360
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND THE

07:44:15.427 --> 07:44:15.827
LET THE POINT OF THIS

07:44:15.894 --> 07:44:19.031
LEGISLATION IS TO. KEEP THOSE

07:44:19.097 --> 07:44:25.537

MY INQUIRIES ALL MY FINAL

07:44:29.074 --> 07:44:32.844
COMMENT IS. IF EVER THERE WAS A

07:44:32.911 --> 07:44:34.613
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I

07:44:34.680 --> 07:44:35.214
THINK COULD BENEFIT FROM MORE

07:44:35.280 --> 07:44:37.249
ANALYSIS IN MORE DISCUSSION I

07:44:37.316 --> 07:44:39.284
THINK YOU'D BE SB ONE. THIS

07:44:39.351 --> 07:44:41.420
WOULD BE A PERFECT CANDIDATE IF

07:44:41.486 --> 07:44:43.355
THIS WERE ROLLED OVER INTO THE

07:44:43.422 --> 07:44:46.358
NEXT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. I LEAVE

07:44:46.425 --> 07:44:47.626
THAT TO THE VOTE COUNT AT THE

07:44:47.693 --> 07:44:49.828
END BUT I THINK MORE

07:44:49.895 --> 07:44:51.697
CONSULTATION ESPECIALLY FROM

07:44:51.763 --> 07:44:53.165
FOLKS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

07:44:53.232 --> 07:44:56.268
COULD MAKE THIS A BETTER PIECE

07:44:56.335 --> 07:44:56.868
OF LEGISLATION WITH MORE WORK

07:44:56.935 --> 07:45:02.874

07:45:06.979 --> 07:45:08.747
QUESTIONING IN THE RESPONSES

07:45:08.814 --> 07:45:10.282
THE WATER CHAIR THE SENATE I

07:45:10.349 --> 07:45:11.650
DID WANT TO WEIGH IN IS JOIN

07:45:11.717 --> 07:45:13.719
AUTHOR THIS LEGISLATION. THE

07:45:13.785 --> 07:45:15.554
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS

07:45:15.621 --> 07:45:18.223
THAT ARE CURRENTLY. UNDER WAY

07:45:18.290 --> 07:45:19.157
BEING NEGOTIATED THAT WE'VE

07:45:19.224 --> 07:45:21.593
ACTUALLY APPROPRIATED FUNDING

07:45:21.660 --> 07:45:24.830
FOR IN OUR BUDGET THIS CYCLE. I

07:45:24.896 --> 07:45:27.599
BELIEVE ARE NOT ONLY CRITICAL

07:45:27.666 --> 07:45:28.166
ELEMENTS OF OUR STATES WATER

07:45:28.233 --> 07:45:33.305
STRATEGY BUT. THEY ARE NOT

07:45:33.372 --> 07:45:37.209
IMPEDED BY THIS LEGISLATION.

07:45:37.276 --> 07:45:39.678
WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS

07:45:39.745 --> 07:45:41.280
WHETHER YOU TRUST THIS

07:45:41.346 --> 07:45:44.449
ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT

07:45:44.516 --> 07:45:45.284
THIS LEGISLATION IN A

07:45:45.350 --> 07:45:47.152
MEANINGFUL FASHION. THAT UP

07:45:47.219 --> 07:45:51.323
HOLD THOSE AGREEMENTS. BIT

07:45:51.390 --> 07:45:51.823
INTERPRETS THE BASELINE

07:45:51.890 --> 07:45:56.495
STANDARDS AND THAT. INTERPRETS

07:45:56.561 --> 07:45:58.230
EXISTING LAW WHICH ALREADY

07:45:58.297 --> 07:45:59.765
APPLIES THE CALIFORNIA

07:45:59.831 --> 07:46:01.800
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FOR

07:46:01.867 --> 07:46:02.401
INSTANCE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY

07:46:02.467 --> 07:46:07.172
PROJECT. THERE IS PLENTY OF

07:46:07.239 --> 07:46:08.373
DISCRETION UNDER EXISTING LAW

07:46:08.440 --> 07:46:10.876
AND OF SB ONE PASSES TO MAKE

07:46:10.942 --> 07:46:13.312
SURE THAT WE CAN FIND SMART

07:46:13.378 --> 07:46:14.446
NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS TO

07:46:14.513 --> 07:46:16.348
ENSURING THAT CENTRAL VALLEY AS

07:46:16.415 --> 07:46:19.551
ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLY. THAT

07:46:19.618 --> 07:46:20.218
AGRICULTURE IS PUT IN A

07:46:20.285 --> 07:46:22.321
SUSTAINABLE POSITION. BUT THAT

07:46:22.387 --> 07:46:24.856
WE ALSO DON'T UNDER CUT. AN

07:46:24.923 --> 07:46:29.861
EXTINCT OUR MOST SACRED

07:46:29.928 --> 07:46:31.430
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

07:46:31.496 --> 07:46:34.232
THE CALIFORNIA ECOSYSTEM. WE

07:46:34.299 --> 07:46:34.833
DIDN'T WANT TO GET PUT IN THIS

07:46:34.900 --> 07:46:38.236
POSITION. WE GOT FORCED INTO

07:46:38.303 --> 07:46:42.808
THIS LEGISLATION. AND YOU MAY

07:46:42.874 --> 07:46:46.445
CALL POLITICS. BUT

07:46:46.511 --> 07:46:49.848
UNFORTUNATELY WASHINGTON. HAS

07:46:49.915 --> 07:46:50.382
DECIDED TO SINGLE OUT THIS

07:46:50.449 --> 07:46:53.385
STATE. AND TRY TO MAKE AN

07:46:53.452 --> 07:46:57.956
EXAMPLE OUT OF US. AND THIS

07:46:58.023 --> 07:47:00.959
LEGISLATION IS NOT INTENDED TO

07:47:01.026 --> 07:47:01.593
POKE THIS ADMINISTRATION IN THE

07:47:01.660 --> 07:47:05.497
I'D. BUT IT DIDN'T INTENDED IS

07:47:05.564 --> 07:47:08.133
STATUS UNCERTAINTY TO SAY THAT

07:47:08.200 --> 07:47:11.002
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BACKWARDS.

07:47:11.069 --> 07:47:12.704
AND THE TRACK WE WERE ON WAS

07:47:12.771 --> 07:47:15.173
WORKING AND IS STILL CAN WORK

07:47:15.240 --> 07:47:15.807
AND I BELIEVE THIS GOVERNOR CAN

07:47:15.874 --> 07:47:17.309
MAKE THIS LEGISLATION WORK. IF

07:47:17.376 --> 07:47:20.579

TO LEE TRIBE DOWN THERE THEY

07:50:14.119 --> 07:50:15.787
HAS TO BRING A TRUCK TO WATER

THEY SERVE BECAUSE WATER SHUT

07:50:19.491 --> 07:50:21.860
OFF. ADDITIONAL CUTS TO THE

07:50:21.927 --> 07:50:22.761
WATER SUPPLY IN INCREASE WATER

07:50:22.827 --> 07:50:25.730
WEIGHTS WILL CONTINUE. TO RISE.

07:50:25.797 --> 07:50:26.798
SB ONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS

07:50:32.938 --> 07:50:34.506
PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH

07:50:34.573 --> 07:50:35.574
MANDATES WATER EXTRACTED TO THE

AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF RAINFALL. A

07:50:39.978 --> 07:50:41.947
AND IT WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT AND

07:50:42.013 --> 07:50:43.214
RAINFALL IS NOT ENOUGH TO

NEW REGULATIONS WERE COMING OUT

08:03:57.308 --> 08:03:58.476

FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. TO GET

08:04:00.911 --> 08:04:02.813

IT'S THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

08:04:49.960 --> 08:04:51.862
IT DOES NOT IN ANY MANNER LOCK

08:04:51.929 --> 08:04:57.468
IN OLD SCIENCE. REFERENCES TO
