HERITAGE MONTH. WHICH IS SO

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.767

AND HARDSHIP THAT OUR API

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.645
COMMUNITY. HASN'T HEARD OVER

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:15.780
THE PAST YEAR. NOW WE KNOW THAT

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.215
ANTI ASIAN DISCRIMINATION IS

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:18.917
NOT NEW AND GOES BACK TO THE

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:20.785
ORIGINS OF IMMIGRATION TO THIS

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.554
COUNTRY. BUT WHAT WE'RE FACING

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:24.155
RIGHT NOW IS SHOCKING AND

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.925
FRIGHTENING TO MANY OF US- AND

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.894
I THINK JUST THE FACT THAT

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.462
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GO UP

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:31.429
TO ASIAN AMERICANS IN THE

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.031
STREET. IN THEIR PLACES OF WORK

00:25:33.098 --> 00:25:35.734
AT THEIR HOMES. AND EVEN IF NOT

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.068
NECESSARILY COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:38.570
WHICH WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF-

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.171
JUST INVADE PEOPLE'S SENSE OF

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:42.107
SAFETY AND SECURITY- I THINK

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:44.142
ALLOWS IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO MANY

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.477
OF US TO FEEL FRIGHTENED TO

00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:47.412
FEEL UNWELCOME IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.480
AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO

00:25:48.546 --> 00:25:50.315
HAPPEN. WE ALL KNOW THE

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.250
CALIFORNIA AND UNITED STATES

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:53.919
ARE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF OUR

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:55.787
DIVERSITY AND THAT IS IN PART

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:57.622
BECAUSE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF

00:25:57.689 --> 00:25:59.925
ASIANS. AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS

00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:02.394
LIKE MY PARENTS WHO CAME. OUT

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.561
TO HEAR FROM KOREA IN NINETEEN

00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:05.563
SEVENTY ONE. MY PARENTS GREW UP

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.197
IN THE KOREAN WAR AND ITS

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.732
AFTERMATH AT A TIME WHEN FOOD

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.935
WAS SCARCE. AND THE ECONOMY WAS

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:10.936
STRUGGLING AND THE REASON THEY

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.971
LOVE SPAM AND TRIED TO RAISE ME

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:13.939
AND MY BROTHER LOVE SPAM

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:15.607
SOMETHING THAT DID NOT STICK.

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:43.641
IS WHAT SHE CALLED IT WHEN SHE

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:45.309

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.777

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:50.314
TECHNICAL TERMS AT A VERY YOUNG

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:52.783

00:40:58.222 --> 00:40:59.590
MONEY YOUR FAMILY WOULD HAVE AT

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.292
THE END OF THE WEEK FOR FOOD OR

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:03.761
RENT EXPENSES. SHE WOULD HAVE

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:05.429
TO GRAB A PENCIL AND PAPER AND

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:07.965
DO HER FIGURES. I ACTUALLY

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.466
JOINED MY MOM AT THE FACTORY

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:10.734
ONE SUMMER WHILE I WAS HOME

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:12.269

HARDEST JOBS I'VE EVER HAD. BUT

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:16.440

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:18.809
SCHOOL COME FALL. MY MOM DID

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:20.711

VERY DEMANDING JOB OR SHE MADE

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.452
VERY LITTLE MONEY. AS SHE GOT

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:30.354

00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:40.231
CHANGED. WOMEN ARE STILL

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.498

STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.355
AND A PROUD CO AUTHOR TO THIS

00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:00.657
BILL THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:03.260
BILL IN MY VIEW AS IT PERTAINS

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:05.762
TO OUR CHILDREN WHICH ARE MOST

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:06.229
VALUED AND VULNERABLE

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:08.298
COMMUNITIES. THIS FEELS

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:09.800
IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.935
NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE SEEN WHAT

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.770
HAPPENS WHEN SOMETIMES CHILDREN

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:16.406
GO BACK TO AN ABUSIVE HOUSEHOLD

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.741
AND HOW SOME CHILDREN DON'T

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.910
MAKE IT OUT. I WANT TO SPEAK ON

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:22.212
BEHALF OF PEAKY A FIVE YEAR OLD

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:24.214
BOY IN MY DISTRICT WHO WAS

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:25.715
MURDERED SUFFOCATED BY HIS

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:28.084
FATHER AFTER COURT. RELEASED

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:30.821
HIM TO HIS FATHER KNOWING THERE

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.422
HAD BEEN ABUSE IN THE HOME.

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:34.758
NUMBER TWO. I ALSO KNOW FROM

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:35.592
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:38.128
DIFFICULT IT IS TO SPEAK UP.

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.496
AGAINST SOMEONE THAT HAS HARM

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:41.264
TO YOU. IT'S ALREADY STRESSFUL

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.099
ENOUGH FOR AN ADULT AND I CAN

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:44.601
ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:47.237
FOR A CHILD HAVING TO TESTIFY.

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.439
OR SPEAK AGAINST ONE OR BOTH

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:52.275
PARENTS. AND STILL TAKING THAT

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:55.011
TESTIMONY AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:57.380
THAT HARM HIM IS VITAL FOR A

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.449
CHILD TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK. WITH

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:02.586
THE- CLARITY AND FEEL SAFE

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:04.688
ABOUT IT. IS EXTREMELY

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:06.189
IMPORTANT SO I APPRECIATE THAT

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:07.557
SENATOR FROM IRVINE FOR

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:09.326
BRINGING THIS MEASURE UP. WE

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:11.628
HAVE TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN WE

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:12.963
HAVE TO ENSURE THAT IF WE EVER

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.464
ALLOW A CHILD TO GO BACK INTO

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.533
AN ABUSIVE HOME. THAT WE HAVE A

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.935
GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO IT HAS

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:20.904
TO BE IN WRITING AND THEY HAVE

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.372
TO JUSTIFY THAT THE RETURN OF

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:26.142
THE CHILD. I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:26.676
FOR SAP A LITTLE BOY THAT

00:52:26.743 --> 00:52:28.512
DIDN'T REALLY GET. VERY MUCH

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.480
COVERAGE AND I MY PERSONAL

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:31.715
OPINION DESERVES. TO BE

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:35.418
HIGHLIGHTED GABRIEL. FERNANDES

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.888
WHO ALSO WAS HARMED BY HIS

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:39.456
BIOLOGICAL MOTHER THE

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.625
STEPFATHER AND EVEN THOUGH THIS

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.560
DOES NOT FALL UNDER THIS LAW

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:45.962
THIS CHILD BY EIGHTEEN WAS SEEN

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.898
BY HIS TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:50.033
CHILD WELFARE WELFARE SERVICES

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.435
THEY ALL SAW THE BRUISES AND

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:53.904
EVERYTHING THIS LITTLE BOY WAS

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.540
HAVING TWIN DOOR AND WE FAILED

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:58.975
TO PROTECT HIM SO I THINK THIS

00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:01.511
BILL IS WHAT WE NEED IN THE

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:03.079
STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:04.948

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.306
SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN

00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:32.242
