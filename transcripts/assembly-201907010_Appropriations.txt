AIMED AT PREVENTING A ROBO CALL SCAMS WHICH ARE USED TO DEFRAUD PEOPLE OF THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND ANYTHING ELSE -- INCLUDING -- THERE -- PEOPLE'S ID'S UP PEOPLE'S AYE IDENTIFICATIONS. I'M PERSONAL INFORMATION. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE BILL HAS NECK WILL NEGLIGIBLE COST IF ANY. TO THE STATE HOWEVER IT COULD PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS. THIS BILL SET TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE DEADLINE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. TO IMPLEMENT CALL RIGHT THAT AUTHENTICATION MEASURES WHICH CAN HELP IDENTIFY ILLEGAL ROBOCALLS AND PREVENT CONSUMERS FROM BEING SCAMMED. THIS BILL DOES NOT. EXPENSIVE UC'S AUTHORITY AND NARROWLY ALLOWS THE CPC TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TICKET TAKE ACTION AGAINST LEGAL WROBEL COLORS IT DOES NOT REQUIRE CALL BLOCKING. I WOULD NOT RESULT IN REAL CALLS BEING BLOCKED IT DOES NOT CREATE SIGNIFICANT. NEW LIABILITIES FOR TELECOMS WE RECENTLY ADDED SEVERAL AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSED CONCERNS OF TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS. AND I WANT TO THANK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND STAFF IN WORKING WITH US AND IN A LONG THAT SAID. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE AS SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. AND FINANCE ALL.

ALL RIGHT I SEE NO QUESTIONS AND WE WILL TAKE THAT UP WHEN WE GET A QUORUM THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR WAS SOME. AND MISTER ROCK. LOOKS LIKE YOUR NEXT. I I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE ONLY PRESENTING ON SB THREE OF SEVEN IT WILL ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AS SOON AS WE GET A FORM YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MEMBERS AS YOU KNOW THE BILL PERTAINS TO A LARGE A LARGE WATER PROJECT IN THE MOJAVE DESERT. WITH REGARD TO WHICH THE PROJECT PROPONENT PROPOSES. TO PUMP AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER PER YEAR FROM THE AQUIFER. DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PUMPING PROPOSED IN A VERY SERIOUS CONFLICT. IN THE SCIENTIFIC -- INFORMATION SURROUNDING THE PROJECT BOTH PRO AND CON. THIS BILL HITS THE PAUSE BUTTON ON THE PROJECT TO ALLOW THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO REVIEW AND RECONCILE THE SCIENCE INVOLVED SO THAT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RIGHT MAYBE ESTABLISHED. SINCE THIS IS A FISCAL NOT A POLICY COMMITTEE I NOTED AS YOUR ANALYSIS REFLECTS. THAT ALLSTATE COSTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE MINOR ABSORB MOBILE. OR REIMBURSABLE AND I RESPECTFULLY AS FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT. APPRECIATE THAT SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. SCENE NINE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] SUPPORT. I'M SORRY DID. HE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. I GOT A QUICK SOUND JUST A REMINDER THAT -- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION YOU'RE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES OF TESTIMONY TO TO WITNESSES AT TWO MINUTES -- AND TO PLEASE KEEP THE ISSUES TO FISCAL MATTERS ONLY. YOU MAY THINK. THANK YOU -- GERMANS ALSO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- NEIL THE SIDE WITH THE NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. SB THREE OH SEVEN WHICH WILL PROTECT THE TREASURE THAT -- CALIFORNIANS LOVE OUR MOJAVE DESERT -- WE SEE THE MOJAVE DESERT AS AN ASSET WORTHY OF CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE -- MIGHT BE RELATED ISSUES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE THESE DESERT PARK'S GENERATED FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT. IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES CREATED OVER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SUSTAINABLE PERMANENT JOBS -- AND OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOMES THIS ECONOMY HAS GROWN OVER THE YEARS -- BUT YOU CAN ONLY GROWING EVEN IT CAN ONLY EXIST IF THE WATER AND LAND RESOURCES ARE PROTECTED. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY THESE BUSINESSES THESE FAMILIES THESE JOBS HAVE BEEN HUNG OUT TO DRY BY THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. WHICH HAS MIRACULOUSLY DECIDED TO REMOVE -- ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN REQUIRED FOR THE KIDDIES WATER PROJECT -- BUT THEY'RE ALSO THINGS EIGHT ARE YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON BECAUSE THEY ARE SO PRICELESS. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THIS REGION AND THE DESERT SPRINGS. ARE SACRED TO NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. WHO HAVE USED THESE PLACES FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS FOR TRADITIONAL PRACTICES AND CEREMONY AND PRAYER? SO EVERYTHING I MENTIONED WE STAND TO LOSE IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT AND IF WE DO NOT ACT. NOW AND WHEN THERE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER COSTING US BILLIONS WHO'S IN THE PICK UP THE TAB BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE COULD EASE. ANSWER SURE THE STATE DOESN'T WANT TO PICK THAT UP. SO THANK YOU SENATOR OUGHT -- THIS BILL INTRODUCES. SCIENCE BASED DECISION MAKING I WOULD CLOSE WHICH IS SAYING THAT IN THESE -- CHALLENGING TIMES -- WE CAN LOOK TO THE WORD I'VE NAY THIN ONE YEAH EIGHT MICHAEL AND SEAN WHO ARE SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW TOGETHER FORM THE R. AND B. GROUP. BOYS TO MEN AND POLITICALLY SIDE LET'S NOT WAIT TILL THE WATER RUNS DRY SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I THINK ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND SUPPORT ALSO WANTED TO CONVEY THE SUPPORT OF AND OUR DC. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN AUTUMN ON CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST ON SUPPORT BRENT AND ALSO SEE A CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. ERICA MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF EARTH JUSTICE IN STRONG SUPPORT. AS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. DO IS THERE NO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION ARE THAT'S OKAY WITH ME BUT IF YOU GUYS DON'T HURRY WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON SORRY TWO MINUTES ON THE PHYSICAL MATTER HOPEFULLY ONLY. SO I MET HIM TERROR -- BUT I'M SURE MEMBERS JOE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt; REPRESENTING KIDDIES OF THEM. YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY SPELLS OUT WHAT OUR CONCERNS ARE. FIRST WITH US THAT. OF THE TERM THAT THE BILL USE RATHER THAN FINDING IS DETERMINATION. ARE INTEREST IN THAT IS TWO THINGS ONE MAKING SURE THAT THE PROCESS THAT THE COMMISSION USES IS. TRANSPARENT ACTUALLY HAS PUBLIC HEARINGS. AND SECONDLY TO MAKE SURE THAT IN FACT THERE'S A FAIR OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE AGES WHO WERE VIEW OF THE DETERMINATION MADE. AS POINTED OUT YOUR ANALYSIS THE AUTHOR HAS TO OF THAT THEY THINK IN FACT THE THE TERMS FINDING AND DETERMINATION ARE INTERCHANGEABLE. OF IF THAT'S INTO THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMAND HOUSES POINTS THAT OUT -- I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT CONCERN ABOUT TRANSPARENCY -- SECONDLY RELATIVE TO TIMING -- THE BILL RIGHT NOW REQUIRES OR ALLOWS THE COMMISSION UP TO TWO YEARS TO DO THE REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE. SINCE THIS IS IMPACT JUST A REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE OF RECONCILIATION AND NOT A BRAND NEW DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE. WE THINK THAT A PERIOD OF A YEAR WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE COMMISSION TO DO THIS -- TWO YEARS WITH EXIST IT'S NOT NECESSARY. OF FINALLY. WE HAD SUGGESTED -- AS AN AMENDMENT THAT THE COMMISSION. IN THEIR DETERMINATION ACTUALLY BE ABLE -- TO ESTABLISH WHAT THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IS THE GOAL OF THE BILL SO THAT THERE WOULD IN FACT BE. ESTABLISHED A SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE FOR THE PROJECT. OF THAT WAS OUR OUR WHOLE INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL ALIGNED WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. SO THE COMMISSION IN THEIR DETERMINATION WOULD DETERMINE THE SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE. OF WHICH WE THINK THAT'S FAIR WE THINK IT'S IN LINE WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. THANK YOU IS THERE ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. GREGORY FOSTER REPRESENTING PARTNERSHIP FOR JOBS AND THE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND A STRONG OPPOSITION IN REGARDS THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND JOB KILLING BILL. THANK YOU.

OF CENTER ROTH IF HE MAY JUST I HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS MAYBE CAN DRESS HE REVIEW IN THE COST OF THE BILL WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION LAST. FOUR IT WILL BE A REIMBURSEMENT ALSO COVER THE COST OF THE STAFF -- FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE PROCESS BUSTS OF BY THE BY THE REIMBURSED BY THE APPLICANT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE KIDDIES. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE FOR THE COSTS BUT THE ISSUE NO UNDER THE THE CODE SECTION INVOLVED WHICH IS -- THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE AMONG OTHERS SIXTY TWO EIGHTEEN ALLOWS THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO RECOVER COSTS OF SERVICES AND SO -- WE ANTICIPATE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OF THE CONSULTATION BY -- DID OF YOU ARE IN PART IN FISH AND WILDLIFE WILL BE FULLY REIMBURSED. THANK YOU. MISTER BROWN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CENTER THIS UP PROJECT IS CLOSE TO MY HEART THE LEAD AGENCY IN SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT IN MY IN MY AREA -- WE LOOK AT SEA QUEST THE GOLD STANDARD IN THOSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS COMPLETED TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE TRIAL COURT UPHELD IN FOURTEEN THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD IN SIXTEEN WHAT WERE YOU HOPING THAT STATE LANDS IS GONNA FIND IN IT DID DID THE SEQUEL PROCESS MISS ANYTHING. WELL THE AS YOU KNOW SEEK WAS OF IS A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE STATUTES. THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS IT'S A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE STATUS THAT YOU TO NOTIFY THE PUBLIC. OF A PARTICULAR PROJECT IT'S PROPOSED. TO IDENTIFY PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES TO ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE MITIGATION FOR THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. SEE QUIRK DOES NOT PERMIT COURTS AT ANY LEVEL. TO RECONCILE DIFFERENCES IN SCIENCE THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THE ER IN FACT THE COURT IS REQUIRED. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE OUR DOCUMENT THE FINAL DOCUMENT. AND IF THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE. IN THE DOCUMENT TO SUBSTANTIATE TO CONSERVE TO SUPPORT THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE LEAD AGENCY. THE COURT CLOSES THE BOOK AT THAT POINT AND IN FACT IN COULD DISS OWN APPELLATE DECISION. PERMISSION TO READ THECOURT SAYS IN REVIEWING THE LEAD AGENCIES ACTIONS UNDERSEA QUOTE WE MAY NOT SET ASIDE AND AGENCIES APPROVAL OF ANY -- ARE ON THE GROUND THAT AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY OR MORE REASONABLE. SO THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SEQUEL CHALLENGES -- I THOUGHT FIVE OR SIXTY ANALYSIS RECITE -- SEVEN WHAT WE DON'T KNOW I I KNOW SOME OF THEM AND I HAVE IN MY NOTES WHAT THE ISSUES WERE THAT THE COURT CONSIDERS IN THOSE. IN THOSE SEEK WITH CHALLENGES BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT AT NO TIME AND NO AND NONE OF THE TWELVE FIVE SIX OR TWELVE DECISIONS. DID THE COURT ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THE VERY VERY SERIOUS CONFLICTS IN THE SCIENCE IN THIS CASE. I GUESS MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT IF YOUR BILL GET SIGNED INTO LAW NOW WILL BE A DECADE AFTER THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME. AND YOU KNOW MY WATER DISTRICTS ARE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF IN THE BUILDING RESERVOIRS I'M A PUBLIC THE CELL PLANET TO HE BEACH IN IT AT EVERY STEP IT SEEMS LIKE THE STATE GETS IN AND LAYS THESE PROJECTS. I MEAN IF WE GOT KIDDIES IN THE DSL PLAN IN MIND WE COULD BE SELF SUFFICIENT IN MY AREA YOU SAW THE EARTHQUAKES IN. IN RIDGECREST IN PLACES LIKE THAT AND THESE PROJECTS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR AREA AND YOU KNOW I HOPE YOU WOULD -- YOU KNOW CONSIDER SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE THE COMPANIES ASK AND JUST NOT MEAN THE LOCAL CONTROL ISSUES IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN. OVER BELIEVE ME IF I MAY VENTURE. I AM IN I LIVE IN SOMETHING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER AND I IN NO WAY IN MY AGAINST PUMPING. WATER FROM THAT -- KIDDIES AQUIFER WE JUST HAVE TO ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE AND DO IT RIGHT. AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS ANALYSIS IS REVIEW AND RECONCILIATIONS NOT DONE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IN THE ER AND THE PROBABLY MANY REASONS FOR THAT -- IN MOST CASES IT IS BY THE LEAD AGENCY AND AND AND THE RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES INVOLVED BUT NOT UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS CASE AND IT'S A SHAME IT WASN'T DONE -- YEARS IF NOT DECADES AGO SO THAT IN FACT WATER AT A SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE COULD BE PUMPING INTO YOUR DISTRICT TODAY. THAT'S THE GOAL AND THAT'S THAT'S MY ONLY GOAL HERE. THANK YOU MISTER OUTWARD AND TAKE OUT AS YOUR CLOTHES. I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS -- AND THAT GETS OUT ON OF THE ROLL CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL TAKE A MOTION ON A SENATOR WEST AS SB TWO ZERO EIGHT AND MOTION BY MISTER CALDERON A SECOND BY MISTER QUIRK.

MY MOTHER WORKED ALONGSIDE CESAR CHAVEZ AND THE UNITED FARM WORKERS UNION SHE BELIEVED IN THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THIS BILL IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF WHO WE ARE AS A WHAT BILL YOU'RE HERE ON SB TWO SEVEN SIX AND YOUR IN SUPPORT. OF OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. SB TWO SEVEN SIX IS AN EXTREMELY COSTLY BILL THAT ATTACKS IMMUNO COMPROMISED CHILDREN WELL THIS COMMITTEE HAS ASSIGNED A LOWER COST TO THE BILL RESPECTFULLY IS A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT. SENATE APPROPRIATIONS THE TERM THAT SB TWO SEVEN SIX WOULD COST TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THIS WAS BEFORE THE AUTHOR MADE SEVERAL AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD. MAKE THE BILL FAR MORE EXPENSIVE TO JUSTIFY ITS PRICE TAG SB TWO SEVEN SIX IS BEING PRESENTED AS A MEANS TO STOP OUTBREAKS AND TO PROTECT IMMUNO COMPROMISED PERSONS. IT WON'T DO EITHER REALISTICALLY THIS BILL WILL COST AN ACCESS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ITS FIRST YEAR AND MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR. THIS DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF LAWSUITS WHEN CHILDREN ARE VACCINATED CANCER DOCTORS BETTER JUDGMENT AND SUFFER INJURY. THIS IS CALIFORNIA WE ARE A SANCTUARY CITY STATE WE DO NOT DEMONIZED CHILDREN CAN WE REALLY JUSTIFY THE EXCESSIVE COSTS OF THIS BILL WITH NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THE MEASLES CASES ARE HAPPENING WITH KIDS WITH A MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT TO IMPLEMENT TWO SEVEN SIX BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER COST SB TWO SEVEN SIX WILL KICK OUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL DAY CARE. WE'VE COUNTLESS OTHERS AT RISK FOR INJURY AND COURSE VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS. SB TWO SEVEN SIX FORCES CALIFORNIA TO COMPROMISE ITS VALUES CALIFORNIA IS INCLUSIVE PROTECTIVE EMPOWERING SB TWO SEVEN SIX AS NONE OF THOSE THINGS WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. OUR KIDS DESERVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY THE ALL CALIFORNIANS ENJOY PLEASE VOTE NO ON THIS BILL ASSET EACH OF YOU MAKE THE TIME TO MEET WITH MEMBERS OF LATINOS FOR MEDICAL FREEDOM IN THE COMING WEEKS.
