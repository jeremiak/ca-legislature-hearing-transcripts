01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:41.721
IN THE MEAT GIVEN THE CONTEXT

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.489
IS. SAN JOSE HAS A DENT HAD

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:44.624
IDEA HAS IDENTIFIED FOR THE

01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:46.092
TWENTY YEARS KARAOKE VALLEY IS

01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:48.895
THE AREA THAT THEY WOULD EXPAND

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:52.999
INTO AND- THEY HAVE A PLAN FOR

01:57:53.065 --> 01:57:54.467
CONCERTS. CAN CONSIDERABLE UP

01:57:54.534 --> 01:57:57.203
HOUSING AND HI TECH DEVELOPMENT

01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:59.705
THERE THE CITY OF SALINAS

01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:01.641
THROUGH THEM ON THEIR PROJECT

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:02.275
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DO A SEQUIN

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:04.944
ALICE'S. TO DETERMINE WHAT THE

01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:05.745
IMPACT IS GOING TO BE ON THE

01:58:05.812 --> 01:58:07.780
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES WE

01:58:07.847 --> 01:58:08.581
ENDED UP NEGOTIATING A DEAL THE

01:58:08.648 --> 01:58:11.584
DOT COM INDUSTRY FELL AND SO

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:13.286
THEY NEVER ENDED UP BUILDING IT

01:58:13.352 --> 01:58:15.488
SO MY QUESTION IS IF YOU KNOW

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:16.956
WHETHER THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO

01:58:17.023 --> 01:58:19.158

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:22.795
HAVE ON THE SURROUNDING

01:58:22.862 --> 01:58:24.597

QUESTION I DO NOT KNOW THE

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:37.143
ANSWER I THINK IN ESTABLISHING

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:40.112
THE OPEN SPACE AUTHORITY THE

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:42.215
PURPOSE IS NOT TO HAVE

01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:43.249
DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD BE

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:46.085
SUBJECT TO SEA QUEST THERE'S

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:47.653
NOTHING IN THE FLOOR NOW SAYS

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.623
THAT SUGGESTS ANY WAIVER OF

01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:53.025
SEAT OR ANY SUPER REQUIREMENTS

01:58:53.092 --> 01:58:55.995

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:04.937
ATE THE COYOTE VALLEY IS

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:06.606
EXACTLY AS YOU DESCRIBED IT IN

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:07.373
ITS VERY VERY SIMILAR TO SO THE

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:10.243
SALINAS VALLEY IN ITS THE

01:59:10.309 --> 01:59:13.813
ABILITY BRO AND TO CREATE OPEN

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:18.150
SPACE IN FIREMAN BUT MY CONCERN

01:59:18.217 --> 01:59:22.722
IS THAT THERE'S BEEN.

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:26.259
CONSIDERABLE GROWTH IN THE JOB.

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:27.226
IN JOBS CREATED IN THE SILICON

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:28.928
VALLEY. PUSHED THAT HAS CREATED

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:29.529
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE IN RURAL

01:59:29.595 --> 01:59:30.429
AREAS THAT ARE TRYING TO

01:59:30.496 --> 01:59:30.997
MAINTAIN THE RURAL CHARACTER

01:59:31.063 --> 01:59:31.898
THAT HAVE A- LACK OF AFFORDABLE

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:32.965
HOUSING THAT HAVE VERY LOW

01:59:33.032 --> 01:59:36.669
WAGES TO COMPETE WITH THOSE

01:59:36.736 --> 01:59:37.303
INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE IN IN THE

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:38.638
SILICON VALLEY. SOME A LITTLE

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:40.907
BIT NERVOUS ABOUT. CREATING A

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:43.242
CONSERVANCY WITHOUT THERE BEING
