00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:17.663 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL PRECEDENT OR COURT

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:20.332 region:rollup2
RULING THAT SAYS THAT THE VOTERS

00:28:17.663 --> 00:28:22.000 region:rollup2
CAN PROVIDE THAT APPROVAL THAT'S

00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:24.169 region:rollup2
NECESSARY UNDER ARTICLE FORM.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.736 region:rollup2
SO THIS INITIATIVE PROPOSES TO

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:26.038 region:rollup2
SPLIT CALIFORNIA INTO THREE

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:27.406 region:rollup2
STATES.

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:28.840 region:rollup2
THESE NEW STATES WOULD BE

00:28:27.406 --> 00:28:30.075 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.110 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD SPAN FROM THE

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:34.112 region:rollup2
OREGON BORDER DOWN ON TO SANTA

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.747 region:rollup2
CRUZ THEN THERE WOULD BE

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:37.516 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHICH WOULD BE MOST

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:38.584 region:rollup2
OF THE COASTAL STATES I'VE ALL

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:39.084 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE COASTAL STATES FROM

00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:40.819 region:rollup2
MODERATE TO LOS ANGELES

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:42.854 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:44.656 region:rollup2
AND THEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:46.391 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD STRETCH FROM ORANGE

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:47.793 region:rollup2
AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY.

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.895 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:50.762 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE REST OF THE CENTRAL

00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:52.731 region:rollup2
VALLEY.

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:54.900 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE ALSO AIMS TO PROVIDE

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:56.535 region:rollup2
THE REQUIRED STATE LEGISLATIVE

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.804 region:rollup2
CONSENT ARDEN UNDER.

00:28:56.535 --> 00:29:00.906 region:rollup2
ARTICLE FOUR OF THE UNITED

00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:02.441 region:rollup2
STATES CONSTITUTION. SO I'M

00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:03.275 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THERE ARE SEVERAL LEGAL

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:05.344 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED BY THIS

00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:07.245 region:rollup2
MEASURE FIRST ON UNITED STATES

00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:08.480 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL SIDE WHETHER.

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.780 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.549 region:rollup2
ALLOWABLE.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.051 region:rollup2
.

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:14.519 region:rollup2
USE OF PASSWORD ALLOWABLE

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:15.220 region:rollup2
APPROVAL PROCESS UNDER ARTICLE

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:16.822 region:rollup2
FOR THE UNITED STATES

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.823 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION AND THAT ALSO UNDER

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:20.158 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL

00:29:17.823 --> 00:29:20.659 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THE QUESTION WOULD

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:22.394 region:rollup2
BE WHETHER THIS IT IS AN

00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:23.996 region:rollup2
ALLOWABLE USE OF THE VOTERS

00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:24.796 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE POWER.

00:29:23.996 --> 00:29:25.797 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE BOTH ISSUES.

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:27.099 region:rollup2
THE COURTS THEMSELVES WOULD

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:29.334 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RESOLVE

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:30.502 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF THE MEASURES APPROVED

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:31.937 region:rollup2
BY VOTERS AND THEN APPROVED BY

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:33.538 region:rollup2
COURTS.

00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:34.873 region:rollup2
WE FIND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:36.141 region:rollup2
ANY DIRECT FISCAL EFFECTS AND

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:37.509 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:39.344 region:rollup2
REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:40.912 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO TAKE EFFECT.

00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:42.681 region:rollup2
CONGRESS COULD DECIDE OUGHT NOT

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:44.316 region:rollup2
TO APPROVE THE REQUEST COULD

00:29:42.681 --> 00:29:45.617 region:rollup2
APPROVE THE REQUEST AS PROPOSED

00:29:44.316 --> 00:29:47.152 region:rollup2
OR CONGRESS COULD APPROVE A

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:49.688 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BUT OF THE STATE STAY

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:51.556 region:rollup2
INTO TWO. DIFFERENT PIECES.

00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:52.958 region:rollup2
IN THAT CASE HE WOULD RETURN TO

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:54.459 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR APPROVAL BY THE

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:56.228 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:58.597 region:rollup2
SO FINALLY I AM IF THE SPLIT DID

00:29:56.228 --> 00:29:59.831 region:rollup2
OCCUR SO IF VOTERS APPROVED IT

00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:01.300 region:rollup2
BOB IT WAS ALLOWED BY THE COURTS

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:02.901 region:rollup2
AND CONGRESS PER.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.669 region:rollup2
APPROVED IT AS PROPOSED

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:04.903 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:06.538 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:07.406 region:rollup2
POLICY AND LEGAL QUESTIONS THAT

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.206 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO

00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:09.541 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:10.609 region:rollup2
BOTH THE EXISTING STATE

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:12.577 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND THEN THE

00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:14.613 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S OF THE NEW STATES

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:16.515 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS

00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:18.450 region:rollup2
AROUND HOW TO DIVIDE

00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:20.485 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ARM. ASSETS AND

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.520 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES HOW TO DIVIDE ITS

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:23.055 region:rollup2
EXISTING PENSION DIED ITS DEBT

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.791 region:rollup2
TO EXTERNAL BOND HOLDERS.

00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:27.526 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS MANY OTHER COMPLEX

00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:29.227 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE

00:30:27.526 --> 00:30:31.563 region:rollup2
RESOLVED BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:32.998 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:34.199 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND I'D ALSO POINT OUT

00:30:32.998 --> 00:30:35.534 region:rollup2
THE BACK ON PAPER I THINK GOES

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:36.868 region:rollup2
THROUGH PRETTY EXHAUSTIVE LIST

00:30:35.534 --> 00:30:37.769 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THE OTHER.

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:38.737 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:46.111 region:rollup2
SORTED OUT.

00:30:38.737 --> 00:30:46.745 region:rollup2
TO CATCH.

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:49.247 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER

00:30:46.745 --> 00:30:51.283 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN.

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:52.984 region:rollup2
A CONSULTANT SAID THANK YOU FOR

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:54.352 region:rollup2
A INVITING ME A AS YOU KNOW THAT

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:55.587 region:rollup2
I'M LAURIN QUE I'M PRESIDENT OF

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:56.521 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR

00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:57.789 region:rollup2
COMMERCE AND EDUCATION OR A

00:30:56.521 --> 00:31:00.125 region:rollup2
THINK TANK AFFILIATED WITH

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:02.094 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

00:31:00.125 --> 00:31:03.762 region:rollup2
UP OUR BOARD CAL CHAMBER BOARD

00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:04.730 region:rollup2
LAST MONTH VOTED TO OPPOSE THE

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:06.965 region:rollup2
THREE STATES MEASURE FOR THREE

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:08.033 region:rollup2
REASONS.

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:10.068 region:rollup2
DISINGENUOUS IT'S

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:10.802 region:rollup2
DISTRACTING.

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:13.839 region:rollup2
AND IF IT'S IMPLEMENTED IT'S

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:16.208 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS.

00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:17.309 region:rollup2
SO FOR ALL OUR SUCCESSES IN IN

00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:18.210 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN FOR THE WONDER THAT

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:20.612 region:rollup2
WERE HELD.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.681 region:rollup2
GLOBALLY.

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:24.449 region:rollup2
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE MANY PROBLEMS.

00:31:22.681 --> 00:31:26.084 region:rollup2
AND NOBODY KNOWS THIS BETTER

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.285 region:rollup2
THAN YOU.

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:29.221 region:rollup2
YOU HEAR ABOUT IT FROM YOUR

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:31.423 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS FROM.

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:32.924 region:rollup2
ARE YOUR COLLEAGUES AND FROM.

00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:35.827 region:rollup2
A US IN THE.

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:37.195 region:rollup2
AMONG THE ORGANIZED INTERESTS.

00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:39.131 region:rollup2
BUT FOR ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN HERE

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:40.265 region:rollup2
FOR MORE THAN A WEEK AND A HALF.

00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:41.433 region:rollup2
YOU REALIZE THAT IF YOU'RE

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.834 region:rollup2
SINCERELY COMMITTED TO FIXING

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:47.105 region:rollup2
ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS.

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:48.740 region:rollup2
YOU FIX THE PROBLEM.

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:50.742 region:rollup2
DIVISION INTO THREE STATES

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.477 region:rollup2
DOESN'T FIX ANY PROBLEMS.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:55.180 region:rollup2
IT MAKES ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:56.681 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVELY WORSE.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.517 region:rollup2
IN THE HOPE THAT SOMEONE WHO'S

00:31:56.681 --> 00:32:00.552 region:rollup2
MORE ENLIGHTENED AND MORE

00:31:58.517 --> 00:32:02.087 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL THAN THE AUTHOR.

00:32:00.552 --> 00:32:05.223 region:rollup2
WILL EVENTUALLY COME AROUND AND

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:06.925 region:rollup2
REALLY FINALLY FIX THE.

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:09.227 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A A

00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:11.229 region:rollup2
PARTIAL LIST OF THE.

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:13.098 region:rollup2
BILLS THAT THE PROPONENT.

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:15.767 region:rollup2
HAS IDENTIFIED ON HIS WEBSITE

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:16.868 region:rollup2
THAT BESET CALIFORNIA.

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.602 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RANKS LAST IN THE

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:19.538 region:rollup2
COUNTRY IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:20.438 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATES NEAR THE BOTTOM

00:32:19.538 --> 00:32:22.407 region:rollup2
IN HIGH PRIORITY SUBJECTS LIKE

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:24.176 region:rollup2
MATH CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAYS

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:25.177 region:rollup2
BRIDGES FREEWAYS AND CITY ROADS.

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:26.344 region:rollup2
ARE RANKED AMONG THE POOREST IN

00:32:25.177 --> 00:32:27.913 region:rollup2
THE NATION

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:29.581 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS PAY THE HIGHEST

00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:30.615 region:rollup2
TAXES IN THE NATION AND YET OUR

00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:32.184 region:rollup2
TAX DOLLARS ARE MISMANAGED IN

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:34.119 region:rollup2
EVERY WAY.

00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:35.454 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT OVERCROWDING AND.

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:37.022 region:rollup2
UNDER FUNDED PRISON SYSTEM IS

00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:38.290 region:rollup2
FAILING CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE

00:32:37.022 --> 00:32:39.457 region:rollup2
REGIONS REQUIRE GOVERNMENT

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.926 region:rollup2
ATTENTION THE TO SPECIFICALLY

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:42.327 region:rollup2
TAILORED TO ADDRESS.

00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:44.162 region:rollup2
THE AREA'S NEEDS.

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:45.030 region:rollup2
SO FROM HIS WEBSITE

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:46.898 region:rollup2
WE'RE YOU CAN QUIBBLE LISTA

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:49.301 region:rollup2
DEGREE BUT YES THESE ARE ALL

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:51.536 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON.

00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:53.472 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY THAT WE TALK ABOUT.

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:54.039 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A BIG CONVERSATION

00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:54.806 region:rollup2
GOES ON IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:57.042 region:rollup2
THESE.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:58.076 region:rollup2
A PROBLEMS.

00:32:57.042 --> 00:32:59.578 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND MAKE

00:32:58.076 --> 00:33:00.979 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VOTER STATE AS FOR

00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:03.381 region:rollup2
THIS INITIATIVE THOUGH IT DOES

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:04.649 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO ADVANCE A SOLUTION

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:06.418 region:rollup2
ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS IT DOESN'T

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:08.954 region:rollup2
ADD A NEW TEACHER. IT DOESN'T

00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:11.623 region:rollup2
REFORM ANY SCHOOL REGULATIONS.

00:33:08.954 --> 00:33:12.457 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T. ARE AND ANY MONEY TO

00:33:11.623 --> 00:33:14.159 region:rollup2
THE ROADS IT DOESN'T TAKE A

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:15.994 region:rollup2
SINGLE A CAR OFF OF THE.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:18.396 region:rollup2
HIGHWAYS

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:20.065 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T A AT ANY PRISON BUT

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:21.666 region:rollup2
BEDS MODIFY.

00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:24.569 region:rollup2
ANY SENTENCES.

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:26.238 region:rollup2
OF RAZOR REDUCE ANY TAXES ARE

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:28.006 region:rollup2
CENTRAL CHALLENGE IS TO.

00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:30.208 region:rollup2
RECONCILE THE PLURALISTIC

00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:33.345 region:rollup2
DEMANDS OF DIVERSE INTERESTS.

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:34.779 region:rollup2
IN A DYNAMIC NATION STATE.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:37.482 region:rollup2
AND ADVANCE THE OVERALL WELFARE

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:39.885 region:rollup2
FOR CITIZENRY THIS INITIATIVE.

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:42.053 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THAT SURRENDER.

00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:44.923 region:rollup2
TO THIS TEST IS A BETTER OPTION.

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:46.258 region:rollup2
THEN RISING TO THAT CHALLENGE.

00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:47.859 region:rollup2
IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SUGGEST A

00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:49.327 region:rollup2
VOTERS.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:51.429 region:rollup2
THAT THE MEASURE IS A SOLUTION

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:53.732 region:rollup2
TO OF VARIETY OF HILLS WHEN IT

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:56.067 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHES NO MORE. THAN TRIED

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:59.204 region:rollup2
DRAWING TWO MORE LINES ON THE

00:33:56.067 --> 00:34:01.006 region:rollup2
MAP OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:02.307 region:rollup2
SO RATHER THAN SEEKING TO SOLVE

00:34:01.006 --> 00:34:03.575 region:rollup2
THE REAL PROBLEMS BEFORE AS THE

00:34:02.307 --> 00:34:05.577 region:rollup2
MEASURE INSTEAD CREATES AN

00:34:03.575 --> 00:34:08.046 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY NEW SUITE OF PROBLEMS

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:09.347 region:rollup2
TO DISTRACT AND CONSUME VOTERS.

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:10.448 region:rollup2
POLITICAL LEADERS LIKE

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:11.316 region:rollup2
YOURSELVES CONCERNED CITIZENS AN

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:13.285 region:rollup2
ORDINARY RESIDENTS.

00:34:11.316 --> 00:34:16.021 region:rollup2
AT.

00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:18.323 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

00:34:16.021 --> 00:34:19.658 region:rollup2
OF US SADLY DON'T.

00:34:18.323 --> 00:34:21.192 region:rollup2
ALWAYS EXHIBIT A ROBUST

00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:24.095 region:rollup2
BANDWIDTH FOR CONSIDERING

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:24.596 region:rollup2
STATE ISSUES.

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:25.797 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE TURNOUT AT

00:34:24.596 --> 00:34:28.667 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY'S

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:29.601 region:rollup2
PRIMARY ELECTION?

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:31.670 region:rollup2
WE WAS EVEN FORTY PERCENT OF.

00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:32.904 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.005 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WILL BE MORE IN IN

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:36.675 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER.

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:38.410 region:rollup2
.

00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:39.945 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:41.313 region:rollup2
TRULY THE LAST THING WE NEED ON

00:34:39.945 --> 00:34:41.846 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT WE GET INVOLVED IN A

00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:42.080 region:rollup2
LOT ABOUT STATEWIDE BALLOT

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:43.048 region:rollup2
MEASURES

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.684 region:rollup2
PROBABLY.

00:34:43.048 --> 00:34:46.284 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NO.

00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:48.353 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING WE NEED ON THIS

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:50.088 region:rollup2
BALLOT.

00:34:48.353 --> 00:34:53.425 region:rollup2
IS A MEASURE OF ITS INFAMOUS.

00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:55.093 region:rollup2
SOLELY FOR ITS AUDACITY.

00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:56.828 region:rollup2
OUR LIMITED CAPACITY TO DISCUSS

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:58.129 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUES

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:59.230 region:rollup2
LIKE HOUSING AND POVERTY AND

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:01.099 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS TAXES

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.200 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:02.734 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE CROWDED OUT BY A

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.936 region:rollup2
POINTLESS SPECULATION AND

00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:06.771 region:rollup2
DEBATE.

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:07.839 region:rollup2
OVER AN UNLIKELY EVENT THAT

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:12.944 region:rollup2
NOBODY IN ANY RESPONSIBLE

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:14.045 region:rollup2
POSITIONS EVER SUGGESTED.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.180 region:rollup2
EVEN IF YOU AGREE THE

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:16.815 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S MUST MAKE

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.584 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO OUR

00:35:16.815 --> 00:35:21.319 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SUCH AS.

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:22.487 region:rollup2
SUCH AN EXISTENTIAL CHANGE

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:24.155 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE THE SUBJECT OF A

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:26.558 region:rollup2
SIMPLISTIC BALLOT MEASURE.

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:27.359 region:rollup2
AS OUR. REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

00:35:26.558 --> 00:35:29.060 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SAID THIS

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:30.395 region:rollup2
IS.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.063 region:rollup2
OF BALLOT MEASURES ARE NOT

00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:33.798 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY.

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:36.434 region:rollup2
THE.

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:39.738 region:rollup2
CORRECT OR APPROVED.

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:41.272 region:rollup2
OF METHOD FOR EVERY OF MATTER

00:35:39.738 --> 00:35:43.341 region:rollup2
YES THE PEOPLE STAND IN THE

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:44.275 region:rollup2
SHOES OF THE LEGISLATURE.

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:46.177 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY VOTE ON. OUR

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:47.212 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES.

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:49.014 region:rollup2
BUT THEY CANNOT REVISE THE

00:35:47.212 --> 00:35:50.315 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:52.550 region:rollup2
THEY CANNOT MAKE WHOLESALE

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:53.518 region:rollup2
CHANGES.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.987 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:56.921 region:rollup2
EVEN EVEN BY OF OF BALLOT

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.123 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE THAT'S A

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:59.124 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT'S

00:35:58.123 --> 00:36:02.027 region:rollup2
WHY WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:35:59.124 --> 00:36:03.461 region:rollup2
REVISION PROCESS.

00:36:02.027 --> 00:36:04.095 region:rollup2
IN THE CONSTITUTION NOT COURSE

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:05.296 region:rollup2
WE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE SO WHO

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:08.133 region:rollup2
KNOWS.

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:09.401 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE THAT THERE ARE

00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:11.269 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING IS MORE

00:36:09.401 --> 00:36:13.271 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE IF YOU WERE.

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:13.805 region:rollup2
SO DELUDED AS TO THINK IT WAS

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:15.407 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

00:36:13.805 --> 00:36:17.142 region:rollup2
EXPLORED. OF THAT THE

00:36:15.407 --> 00:36:18.510 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ITSELF SHOULD DO OR

00:36:17.142 --> 00:36:20.045 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:22.247 region:rollup2
REVISION COMMISSION TO CONSIDER.

00:36:20.045 --> 00:36:23.581 region:rollup2
SO FINALLY.

00:36:22.247 --> 00:36:24.682 region:rollup2
AND SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY ALL

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:26.451 region:rollup2
SPEND A FEW MINUTES DWELLING ON

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.985 region:rollup2
THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:29.254 region:rollup2
OF BREAKING CALIFORNIAN TO

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:31.089 region:rollup2
PIECES.

00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:33.024 region:rollup2
THE.

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:34.459 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ARE STARTING TO SAY

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:35.794 region:rollup2
THE LEAST FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF

00:36:34.459 --> 00:36:36.294 region:rollup2
STATE ASSETS ASSIGNMENT OF STATE

00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:38.063 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT TO

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:39.197 region:rollup2
MENTION.

00:36:38.063 --> 00:36:40.932 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE INHERENT

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:43.134 region:rollup2
INEQUITIES THAT WILL ARISE FROM

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:44.702 region:rollup2
ARBITRARY GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISION

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:46.938 region:rollup2
OF ECONOMIC FINANCIAL PHYSICAL.

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:48.406 region:rollup2
AND CULTURAL PATRIMONY HAS.

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:51.276 region:rollup2
AND IT LOOKED LIKE YOU I'D LIKE

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:53.078 region:rollup2
TO COMMEND. THE STAFF REPORT OR

00:36:51.276 --> 00:36:54.479 region:rollup2
STAFF REPORTS THAT WERE OF DONE

00:36:53.078 --> 00:36:56.581 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMMITTEE AND TO MAKE

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:57.749 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S.

00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:00.318 region:rollup2
IS THE PRICE OF FROM THERE.

00:36:57.749 --> 00:37:01.553 region:rollup2
THEIR THOROUGH.

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:02.954 region:rollup2
BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE JUST A

00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:04.989 region:rollup2
SAMPLING OF WHAT WE.

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:06.324 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU WOULD FACE?

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:07.826 region:rollup2
SHOULD THIS INITIATIVE PASS AND

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.760 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE CONGRESS AGREED TO

00:37:07.826 --> 00:37:10.862 region:rollup2
SET MOTION DIVISION TO THREE

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:14.132 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

00:37:10.862 --> 00:37:14.499 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL. WITH WITH WITH.

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:15.467 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE.

00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:17.802 region:rollup2
.

00:37:15.467 --> 00:37:19.070 region:rollup2
TO THE.

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:20.505 region:rollup2
STATEMENT THAT THERE'S NO DIRECT

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.974 region:rollup2
COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:24.142 region:rollup2
TRUE THERE'S NO.

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:25.343 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL DIRECT COST OF

00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:26.478 region:rollup2
SENDING A LETTER TO CONGRESS

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.579 region:rollup2
WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS.

00:37:26.478 --> 00:37:29.114 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:30.882 region:rollup2
.

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:33.685 region:rollup2
DOES.

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:34.786 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S DISINGENUOUS AND

00:37:33.685 --> 00:37:35.220 region:rollup2
REALLY A DISSERVICE TO THE TO

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:37.255 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.889 region:rollup2
TO.

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:40.091 region:rollup2
TO TO NOT.

00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:41.526 region:rollup2
.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:43.495 region:rollup2
A LAYOUT AT LEAST WHAT THE

00:37:41.526 --> 00:37:45.430 region:rollup2
INITIAL COSTS WOULD BE IF THIS

00:37:43.495 --> 00:37:48.166 region:rollup2
WAS TO BE ADOPTED AND.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.366 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST SIT HERE AND AND.

00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:50.201 region:rollup2
AND.

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:52.003 region:rollup2
REQUEST THAT WHEN YOU DO

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:53.571 region:rollup2
PUBLISHER FINAL FISCAL ANALYSIS

00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:54.939 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DO A CONSIDER SOME OF

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:56.107 region:rollup2
THESE.

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:57.275 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE VOTERS TO READ THE

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.376 region:rollup2
BALLOT PAMPHLET THAT'S ONE OF

00:37:57.275 --> 00:38:00.812 region:rollup2
THE PLACES WHERE.

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:02.614 region:rollup2
THEY DO GET INFORMATION.

00:38:00.812 --> 00:38:04.115 region:rollup2
.

00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:05.884 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE IF THE IT IF THE

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.718 region:rollup2
CONGRESS WERE TO APPROVE SUCH A.

00:38:05.884 --> 00:38:07.886 region:rollup2
.

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:10.255 region:rollup2
.

00:38:07.886 --> 00:38:11.256 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS.

00:38:10.255 --> 00:38:13.124 region:rollup2
WELL FIRST THE ORIGINAL STATE OF

00:38:11.256 --> 00:38:14.526 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.794 region:rollup2
WILL BE OBLIGATED TO SPEND TENS

00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:17.529 region:rollup2
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

00:38:15.794 --> 00:38:19.497 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHMENT OF.

00:38:17.529 --> 00:38:19.898 region:rollup2
THREE CONVENTIONS

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.933 region:rollup2
IN EACH OF THE NEW

00:38:19.898 --> 00:38:22.600 region:rollup2
PROTESTATIONS.

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:24.569 region:rollup2
TO DIVIDE THE CONSTITUTION AND A

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.703 region:rollup2
SET OF LAWS.

00:38:24.569 --> 00:38:27.906 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD REQUIRE DELEGATE

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:29.908 region:rollup2
SELECTION PROCESS MEETING STAFF

00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:30.575 region:rollup2
LEGAL SUPPORT NOT REACH COURSE

00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:32.010 region:rollup2
THE STATE WOULD.

00:38:30.575 --> 00:38:33.444 region:rollup2
AS YOU SUGGESTED THE STATE

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.779 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND.

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:36.748 region:rollup2
AGAINST VIGOROUSLY LITIGATION ON

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:37.582 region:rollup2
THE VALIDITY OF THE MEASURE.

00:38:36.748 --> 00:38:39.317 region:rollup2
ALLEN MANY ASPECTS OF THE

00:38:37.582 --> 00:38:40.051 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT COMES OUT OF IT.

00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:42.153 region:rollup2
SECOND EACH OF THE THREE NEW

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:43.454 region:rollup2
STATES.

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:45.623 region:rollup2
BECOME START OF VENTURES

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:47.058 region:rollup2
REQUIRING.

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:49.060 region:rollup2
ELECTION OF NEW STATEWIDE AND

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:49.928 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE OFFICIALS

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:57.702 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT OF NEW EXECUTIVE

00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:58.236 region:rollup2
BRANCH OFFICERS NEW RECRUITMENT

AND HIRING STATE OF STAFF

00:38:58.236 --> 00:39:00.538 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT OF NEW.

00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:01.873 region:rollup2
PRISON GRANTEES

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:03.975 region:rollup2
ADOPTION OF NEW CODES GOVERNMENT

00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:04.576 region:rollup2
CODE CIVIL CODE.

00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:05.176 region:rollup2
TAX CODE CRIMINAL QUOTE ALL OF

00:39:04.576 --> 00:39:06.344 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:08.513 region:rollup2
MAYBE NEW CENSUS.

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:09.781 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:11.082 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE FUN BEGINS THAT'S

00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:12.517 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST ALL THE BASIC

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.319 region:rollup2
MINIMUM TO GET THE STRUCTURE IN

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:16.387 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:18.356 region:rollup2
.

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:18.356 region:rollup2
AGAIN I POINT TO THE

00:39:19.057 --> 00:39:23.027 region:rollup2

BALLOTS AND OTHERS TO BE COUNTED

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.779 region:rollup2

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:03.681 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY GO UP

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:05.883 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY BANG IT ONLY HAS

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:07.418 region:rollup2
SO FAR TO GO. PRETTY POOR TURNED

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.686 region:rollup2
OUT TO YOUR POINTS.

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:10.688 region:rollup2
EXACTLY AND I WILL JUST HAVE TO

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:12.023 region:rollup2
SAY THAT.

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:14.158 region:rollup2
PATTERN TWENTY LEGISLATORS WHO

00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:15.126 region:rollup2
ARE HERE AND YES WE FIGHT FOR A

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:17.495 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT WE FIGHT FOR

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:19.230 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS BUT. WE ALSO HAVE A

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:21.132 region:rollup2
MUCH BROADER SENSE OF WHAT'S

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.800 region:rollup2
GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE STATE.

00:43:21.132 --> 00:43:23.868 region:rollup2
AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.970 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT

00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:27.171 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.272 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THINK ABOUT BREAKING

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.841 region:rollup2
THAT UP AND BREAKING IT DOWN

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.375 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:31.809 region:rollup2
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ACOSTA

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.377 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.712 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY.

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:36.080 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.981 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATORS NOT A QUESTION

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.183 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK INCOME OF THIS

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:41.152 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FOR THOSE REASONS

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:41.986 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE.

00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:43.654 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ARTICULATED SOLD BE

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:44.222 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:46.157 region:rollup2
IF THIS GETS ON THE BALLOT.

00:43:44.222 --> 00:43:48.392 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:50.061 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

00:43:48.392 --> 00:43:52.063 region:rollup2
REALLY WOULD HAVE TO SAY ABOUT

00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:53.164 region:rollup2
IT BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT OUR?

00:43:52.063 --> 00:43:54.565 region:rollup2
QUESTION IT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:56.567 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO BE RESPONDED TO

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:59.036 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY AND FORTUNATELY OR

00:43:56.567 --> 00:44:01.372 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THEY SEEM TO BE

00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:02.673 region:rollup2
INCAPABLE OF DOING MUCH OF THAT.

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:04.408 region:rollup2
BUT A WHAT WE SAID TO THEM. WHO

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:06.110 region:rollup2
KNOWS AND WE ARE YOU KNOW WE WE

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:07.378 region:rollup2
ARE GOVERNING AND YOU YOU POINT

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.446 region:rollup2
OUT THAT DIVIDES AND SOME OF THE

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:10.214 region:rollup2
POLITICAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE

00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:11.282 region:rollup2
IN THE FIGHTS THAT WE HAVE?

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:12.984 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE STRONG

00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:14.619 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES WE ARE

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:16.787 region:rollup2
GOVERNING WE ARE GOVERNING IN A

00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:19.223 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN WAY PRIMARILY IN BOTH

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:21.058 region:rollup2
HOUSES AND HAVE OF VARIETY OF

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:23.427 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES AT THE TABLE AS WE

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:24.862 region:rollup2
DO POLICY AND. HOW HOW COULD

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:27.098 region:rollup2
ANYONE WANT TO BREAK?

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:28.399 region:rollup2
THE PROGRESS

00:44:27.098 --> 00:44:29.267 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE MADE BREAK IT UP THEN

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:31.536 region:rollup2
THEY MOVE TO SOMETHING ELSE SO

00:44:29.267 --> 00:44:33.271 region:rollup2
I KNOW I THAT IS.

00:44:31.536 --> 00:44:34.405 region:rollup2
THIS PRIORITY WITH THAT.

00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:35.540 region:rollup2

THAT WAS DONE TO.

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:43.614 region:rollup2
BUT AT WHAT THEIR POTENTIAL

00:44:41.946 --> 00:44:44.549 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS ARE WILL WE ILL

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:46.350 region:rollup2
