LET Y'ALL KNOW AND- SORT

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.888
COMMENTS TODAY WILL JUST FOCUS

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:07.057
ON OUR INITIAL POTS SOME OF THE

00:52:07.123 --> 00:52:08.124
KEY PROPOSALS THAT WERE

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:10.660
PRESENTED IN MINISTRATION. A

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:12.128
SECOND GENERAL NOW IS THAT WE

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:16.600
WERE. ASKED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:18.702
IS COOLEY TO HIRE YOUR- FOR

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.770
LEGISLATIVE AND- OR- IN WHICH

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.339
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.674
MAY NOT FULLY ALIGNED. WITH

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:26.543
PREVIOUSLY STATED LEGISLATIVE

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.512
PRIORITIES. I WITH THAT IN

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.547
MIND- MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:32.682
BE FOCUSED ON CAL WORKS- AND

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:35.585
FIRST ONE CALVERTS CASE THOUGH.

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.020
COURSE WE'RE IN THE OF

00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:38.555
REVIEWING THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:40.357
CASELOAD ESTIMATES ACROSS THE

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.592
S. ANCE BUT I KNOW THAT. OUR

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.628
EXCUSE LOGIN PARTICULARS IN AN

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.296
INTEREST OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:52:46.363 --> 00:52:48.131
SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN OUR

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:50.467
OFFICE HAS BEEN PRODUCING MUCH

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:52.269
LOWER FORECAST FOR THIS PROGRAM

00:52:52.335 --> 00:52:54.271
AND ADMINISTRATION- OVER THE

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:55.939
MAY REVISION INCLUDE SOME LARGE

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:58.909
DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO THE

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:00.310
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES AND-

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:03.046
UPON INITIAL REVIEW THEY APPEAR

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:04.948
REASONABLE. STOPIT MORE

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:09.019
CONSERVATIVE THAN OUR OFFICES

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:09.519
BUT THEY'RE IN THE SAME

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:12.255
BALLPARK- ALSO EDIT HEARING TO

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.024
SKIP SUBCOMMITTEE EXPRESSED A

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.059
PARTICULAR INTEREST. IN

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:17.661
REVIEWING OPTIONS TO

00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:18.862
POTENTIALLY REVERSE THE

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:20.764
PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN COMMERCE

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.599
IS THE THAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:25.101
LAST SPRING. AND ON INITIAL

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.503
REVIEW OF THE MAY REVISION WE

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.638
HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO POLICIES

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.106
THAT HAVE SOME POTENTIAL TO

00:53:30.173 --> 00:53:32.876
INCREASE BY COWARDS IS THE-

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:35.412
ALTHOUGH WE THINK IN BOTH CASES

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:37.781
THAT POTENTIAL CASE THAT IMPACT

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:39.883
APPEARS QUITE MODEST. THE FIRST

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.152
IS THE FIVE POINT 3% GRANT

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:44.421
INCREASE THAT IS PAID FOR BY

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:46.723
REALIGNMENT REVENUE WELL WE

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.124
ROUGHLY ESTIMATE THIS COULD

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:50.060
INCREASE KESSLER WELL MAYBE A

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.662
FEW THOUSAND CASES GENERALLY

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:54.297
OKAY SO DOES SEEM TO INCREASE

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:58.368
AS THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM

00:53:58.435 --> 00:53:59.869
INCREASE. THE INCREASE WOULD

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:00.770
STILL FAR SHORT OF THE WHICH

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:04.307
STATED AND- HISTORY GRANT 250%

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:06.443
FAVORABLE FEDERAL POVERTY. FOR

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:07.444
A FAMILY THAT'S ONE PERSON

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.512
LARGER THAN THE CAL WORKS

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:11.581
ASSISTANCE YOU. THE

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:13.249
ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:15.552
THIS IS SECOND PROPOSAL HAS

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:18.021
SOME POTENTIAL CASE OF IMPACT.

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.689
DO YOU SOME FEDERAL FUNDING TO

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.192
CENTER SIX HUNDRED FORTY DOLLAR

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:23.760
ONE TIME PAYMENT ALL CAL WORKS

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.962
FAMILIES IN JULY. THIS BILLS

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.664
OFTEN EARLIER SIX HUNDRED

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:29.733
DOLLAR ONE TIME PAYMENT OF SENT

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:30.767
TO THE SAME FAMILIES LAST

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:33.970
SPRING. WELL AS CONSTRUCTIVE

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:35.972
THIS WOULD OF COURSE PROVIDE

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:37.207
SOME BENEFITS OF FAMILIES WHO

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:38.842
ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN CAL

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:39.776
WORKS BUT WE THINK IT'S

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:41.811
UNLIKELY. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.980
HAVE ANY NOTICEABLE IMPACTS ON

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:46.149
CASE THOUGH HOWEVER WE DO THINK

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:47.584
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.686

GOALS OF FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:56.893
LEGISLATURE WERE TO. CHOOSE TO

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.528
DELAY THIS PAYMENT BY A MONTH

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:01.631
OR TWO AND COMBINE THAT WITH-

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:04.067

ENCOURAGE MORE FAMILIES

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:08.878
INTENT LANGUAGE TO ONCE AGAIN

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:11.948
PROVIDE ESSES P. GRANT- COST OF

00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:13.416
LIVING ADJUSTMENTS ON AN

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:15.718
ONGOING BASIS BEGINNING IN TWO

00:59:15.785 --> 00:59:18.888
THOUSAND. AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.390
TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. THE

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:22.191
MASTER PLAN FOR AGING ALSO

00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:24.260
SUCKS OF GOAL OF BRINGING AS A

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:26.462
SCIENCE IS P. GRANTS UP TO THE

00:59:26.529 --> 00:59:28.831
ELDER ECONOMIC INDEX AND

00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:33.269
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. TO THE

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:33.736
EXTENT THAT FUNDING IS

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:34.871
AVAILABLE. NOW CURRENTLY THE

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:35.905
ADMINISTRATION IS EFFECTIVELY

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.907
PROPOSING TO INCREASE S. S. P.

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:39.642
GRANT LEVELS FOR INDIVIDUALS

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:42.979
ONLY BY ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. WELL

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.647
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.249
GREAT INCREASE IS A STEP IN THE

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.251
RIGHT DIRECTION IT ALTERNATELY

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:50.320
DOES NOT PROVIDE THOSE FUTURE

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.522
COLAS I'M PER LEGISLATIVE

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:55.058
INTENT LANGUAGE OR INCREASE

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:57.193
GRANTS TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.595
LEVEL AS MENTIONED IN THE

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:00.663
MASTER PLAN FOR AGING.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.432
ADDITIONALLY WHILE THE PROPOSED

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:06.002
INCREASE RETURNS GRANTS TO TWO

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.270
THOUSAND ELEVEN LET THE TWO

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:08.738
THOUSAND ELEVEN LEVELS MOST OF

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.940
THE PRIOR REDUCTIONS ARE NOT

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.575
ACCOUNTED FOR ESPECIALLY FOR

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.944
COUPLES. AND BASED ON OUR ROUGH

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.146
CALCULATION INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:19.649
STILL AT A LOWER LEVEL RELATIVE

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:22.719
TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE AND

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.520
THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:25.021
ELEVEN. AGAIN WHILE THE

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:26.322
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL GREAT

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:27.824
INCREASE IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.559
DIRECTION I WITH REGARD TO

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.361
THOSE BROADER GOALS OF

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.329
INCREASING THE S. S. P. GRANTS

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:34.697
THE LEGISLATURE COULD PICK A

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.499
DIFFERENT GRANT GRANT BENCHMARK

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.167
IF IT WANTED TO RESTORE LET'S

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:39.602
SAY A GREATER SHARE OF THE PAST

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.671
JUSTICE P. REDUCTIONS OR GET

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:42.972
INDIVIDUALS CLOSER TO THE

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:45.141
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND A

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.776
BROADER POINT THAT WE'D LIKE TO

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.811
REDUCE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:50.113
THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.981
IN ITS TOTALITY WELL THE

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.083
ADMINISTRATION IS DIRECTING

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.152
RESOURCES TO PROP UP NEW SOCIAL

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:59.255
SERVICES INTERVENTIONS- WE

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.790
DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT SAME

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.959
LEVEL OF AUGMENTATION. AND THE

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.560
MAJORITY OF THE SAFETY NET

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:08.064
PROGRAMS LIKE ISIS ISIS P.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:10.333
GRAMS. THE LAST ISSUE BUT I

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.100
WILL TO COMMON ON IS THIS

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.668
NUMBER TWO. THE LONG TERM CARE

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:15.204
PATHWAYS PROPOSAL. JUST TO

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:16.439
RAISE POSSIBILITIES FOR

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.374
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AND

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.777
AGAIN FOR CONTACT THE CONCEPT

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.445
ITSELF OF PROVIDING TRAINING

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.113
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AGES AS

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.849
PROVIDERS. HAS BEEN RAISED-

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.084
DURING THE MASTER PLAN FOR

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.886
AGING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.821
WAS BROADLY MENTIONED WITHIN

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.089
THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING OUT

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:35.291
RESULTING ONLY ADOPTED. AND

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.993
THIS MAY BE DUE IN PART BECAUSE

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.462
I JUST I JUST AS PROVIDERS AND

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.197
TO THE PROGRAM. PERHAPS NOT

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.832
NECESSARILY WITH THE INTENTION

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:45.334
OF MAKING A CAREER OUT OF IT

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.003
BUT REALLY TO CARE FOR A FAMILY

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:49.806
MEMBER OR FRIEND. HOWEVER THE

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:50.440
TYPE OF SERVICES THAT THEY ARE

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.475
PROVIDING ARE VERY SIMILAR TO

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.877
WHAT- A PRIVATE HOME HEALTH

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.813
AIDE PROVIDES SO THEN THE

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:57.480
QUESTION IS RAISED AS TO

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.182
WHETHER IT. PERHAPS A MORE

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:00.416
TAILORED PROGRAMMING YOUR

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.118
OUTREACH APPROACH IS NEEDED TO

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.153
MAKE THOSE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.588
WORK THAT I JUST AS PROVIDERS

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.757
ARE DOING AND CONNECTING THEM

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.392
TO EXISTING HEALTH CARE PATHWAY

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.893
PROGRAMS. SO WHILE THE

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.728
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL MAY

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.530
TRY. TO GET INTO THIS BROADER

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:16.899
CONCEPT AT THIS TIME WE DON'T

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:19.202
HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:20.436
TO REALLY ASSESS THE MERITS OF

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.572
THE PROPOSAL. AND WHAT I MEAN

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.841
BY THAT IS THAT A ONE WE DON'T

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.008
KNOW HOW THE ADMINISTRATION

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.510
CAME UP WITH THATTWO HUNDRED

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.178
MILLION DOLLARS BAKER WE DON'T

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:31.147
NECESSARILY HAVE A FIRM GRASP

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.182
OF THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE- WE

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.584
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY I JUST AS

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.885
PROVIDERS WILL ULTIMATELY BE

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:38.187
SERVED. BUT THEN ALSO WE DON'T

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:40.623
KNOW WHAT PROBLEM OR UNMET NEED

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.125
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.127
IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AND HOW IT

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:47.029
SUCCESS WILL BE MEASURED. AND

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.531
WE DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY THE

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.333
MIX OF TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:52.101
ARE THOSE THE MOST INFECTIVE OR

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.770
IMPACTFUL- OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:57.340
ACCESS PROVIDERS- AND TO WHAT

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.175
EXTENT WILL THE DEPARTMENT

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:01.244
LEVERAGE EXISTING. AND PROVEN

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.079
HOME HEALTH TRAINING PROGRAMS

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.113
IT THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:11.154
AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS- IN

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.588
THIS ENDEAVOR. AND AGAIN WE

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:13.823
WILL STE- WE'RE STILL BE STAGE

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.292
OF IT AND- TO MAKE. PROPOSAL

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.260
AND ILL CONTINUE TO WITH THE

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:18.561
MISTER TO ADDITIONAL DE.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:19.428
HOWEVER IF THE NAY. LEVEL OF

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.230
DEEP CANNOT BE PROVIDED TO THE

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.565
LEGISLATURE WITHIN THE SHORT

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.600
BUDGET TIME FRAME- BUT THE

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.135
LEGISLATURE ITSELF IS STILL

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.470
INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.138
IN THIS SPACE. WE CAN HELP THE

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:30.706
LEGISLATURE THINK THROUGH

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:32.341
PERHAPS ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:33.643
THAT ARE MORE DEFINED IN

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.344
ACTIONABLE WITHIN THE SHORT

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:36.913
TIME FRAME WHICH MAY NOT

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.314
NECESSARILY REQUIRE AS MUCH

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.349
FUNDING TO BEGIN WITH. BUT CAN

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.852
AT LEAST BE BUILT UPON PERHAPS

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.587
NEXT YEAR IN FUTURE YEARS AS

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.122
THE ADMINISTRATION SOLIDIFIED

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:47.723
THE MORE DEFINED LONG TERM

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.193
STRATEGY- WITH THAT I'LL NOW

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.261
PASS IT ON TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:56.732
LEARN THIS. WHO I WILL END WITH

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:57.233
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.402

ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I WILL

AFFORDABILITY READY AND

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.414
HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.182
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES HAVE

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:13.816
BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.952
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.820
AND ARE WORTHWHILE GOALS. THE

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.322
GOVERNOR'S OVERALL HOUSING

HOMELESSNESS PLAN WILL BE

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.124
DISCUSSED AT THE ASSEMBLY STEP

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:24.293
FOR HEARING TOMORROW. IT IS

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.294
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:27.730
THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT FROM

THE ADMINISTRATION TODAY OUR A

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.968
PIECE OF THIS LARGER MULTI

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.403
DEPARTMENTAL PROPOSAL. WELL KEY

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.938
QUESTION WE HAVE A SPECIFIC TO

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:38.040
THE PROPOSALS AND DSF IS HOW

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:39.675
THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.544
FUNDING INCREASES WORK WITH THE

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.345
OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.380
GOVERNOR'S PLAN. TO ACHIEVE THE

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:45.548
STATED GOAL OF ELIMINATING

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.650
HOMELESSNESS FOR FAMILIES

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.318
WITHIN FIVE YEARS. WELL THE

REVISION PROPOSES TO EXPAND A

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:53.256
JANUARY PROPOSAL FOR A NEW

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:55.224
PROGRAM TO ACQUIRE AND RENOVATE

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.159
COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES. MOST

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:00.229
PROPOSAL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.131
EXISTING DSS PROGRAMS. THE

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.633
PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:05.868
REPRESENT VERY LARGE INCREASES

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:06.435
TO THE BASELINE FUNDING FOR

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:09.005
THESE PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.873
STATE TYPICALLY SPENDS NINETY

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.275
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:13.576
ON THE CAL WORKS HOUSING

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.578
SUPPORT PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR

PROPOSES FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:18.948
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR EACH

OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS IT IS NOT

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:22.718
CLEAR WHAT ASSESSMENT WAS DONE

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.220
TO DETERMINE THIS LEVEL OF

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:26.522
ESTIMATED NEED FOR EACH OF

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:29.225
THESE PROPOSALS. A KEY QUESTION

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.326
WILL BE WHETHER THE PROGRAM

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.360
WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.329
ADMINISTER AND SPENT THIS NEW

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:33.996
FUNDING WITHIN PROPOSED

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.798
TIMELINES. WOULD IT BE BETTER

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.900
PERHAPS TO PROVIDE SMALLER

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:40.002
AMOUNTS OVER MORE YEARS. WE

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.470
UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.272
ANTICIPATES INTRODUCING TBL FOR

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:44.674
SOME OF THESE HOUSING AND

DISRUPTED- AT ISSUE THAT WE'VE

01:52:05.518 --> 01:52:07.587
IDENTIFIED OVER THE LAST

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.889
SEVERAL YEARS. WE'VE NOTED AND

01:52:09.956 --> 01:52:11.458
WE'VE BEEN TRACKING INDIVIDUALS

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:13.426
WHO HAVE LEFT THE EARLY START

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:15.495
PROGRAM AND HAVE NOT BEEN

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:16.896
ELIGIBLE FOR LETTERMAN

SERVICES. UNDER A DEVELOPMENTAL

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.967
DISABILITY AND SO I'LL JUST

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:24.370
MAKE NOTE THAT- BURKE EIGHT IN

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:26.706
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY CHILDREN

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:28.875
BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIVE AND

01:52:28.942 --> 01:52:34.247
TEN. THAT WE HAD. SIX SIXTY

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:34.781
THREE THOUSAND FORTY NINE

01:52:34.848 --> 01:52:35.949
INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SERVICES

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:37.851
DURING THAT TIME AT THAT AGE

01:52:37.917 --> 01:52:41.688
GROUP. OF NOTE EIGHT POINT 1%

01:52:41.754 --> 01:52:43.823
SELF JUST OVER FIVE THOUSAND

01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:46.159
CHILDREN EXPERIENCED A GAP

01:52:46.226 --> 01:52:48.161
BETWEEN BEING AN EARLY START

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:49.796
AND THEN HAVING TO RETURN TO

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:52.432
LETTERMAN SERVICES. SO IN THIS

01:52:52.499 --> 01:52:56.803
GAP- IT IS ALSO NOTED. THAT A

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.872
NUMBER OF THESE CHILDREN HAVE A

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:02.609
DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. SO 75% OF

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:03.977
THE CHILDREN AND EXPERIENCE

01:53:04.043 --> 01:53:07.947
THIS GAP- IS OUR CHILDREN WITH

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:10.917
AUTISM- WHEN WE HAD DETERMINES

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:13.419
ELIGIBILITY IS ACTUALLY LOWER

01:53:13.486 --> 01:53:15.455
THAN THAT. AND SO WE'RE REALLY

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:17.123
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:18.925
WE'RE HAVING TO BRING KIDS IN

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:20.693
AT A LATER DATE WITH A

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:24.164
DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. IN WHICH-

01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:25.632
THIS PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY-

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:29.235
PRESENTED TO ADDRESS THIS- ONE

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:31.871
KEY ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY DURING

01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:34.040
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AS

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:36.042

EARLY START IN ROME AND HAS

01:53:37.844 --> 01:53:39.812
BEEN DOWN BY TEN PERCENT.

01:53:39.879 --> 01:53:41.981
COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR THE

01:53:42.048 --> 01:53:44.684
SAME MONTH. THIS DECLINE AS

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:46.019
WE'VE NOTED TO AND WE'VE I'M

01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:47.754
SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:53.293
ON BRINGING THE KIDS IN. FROM

01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:53.860
BIRTH TO THREE TO THE REYES

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:55.495
ALSO ENTERS FIRST AND SERVICE.

01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:56.095
BUT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT

01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:58.131
WE BETWEEN TEN AND FOURTEEN

01:53:58.198 --> 01:53:59.499
THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT MAY HAVE

01:53:59.566 --> 01:54:01.534
ACCESS EARLY START SERVICES IN

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:03.536
THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THAT

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:05.238
WOULD NOT THAT HAVE NOT

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:07.473
ACTUALLY ACCESS THESE SERVICES

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.475
TO THAT END OUR PROPOSAL IS

01:54:09.542 --> 01:54:12.745
PRESENTING- I REQUEST TO BE

01:54:12.812 --> 01:54:14.547
ABLE TO HAVE A PROVISIONAL

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:16.683
ELIGIBILITY FOR THREE AND FOUR

01:54:16.749 --> 01:54:18.151
YEAR OLDS THAT IS DIFFERENT

01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:20.086
THAN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE

01:54:20.153 --> 01:54:21.588
THAT ARE CURRENTLY FROM THREE

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.990
ON THAT. SO THIS PROVISION

01:54:24.057 --> 01:54:25.658
WHICH I'M REMOVED A REQUIREMENT

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:28.861
OF HAVING AN ACTUAL DIAGNOSIS-

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:29.862
OF AN INTELLECTUAL AND

01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:31.531
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY THAT'S

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:33.666
OUTLINED IN THE LATTER MANAK-

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:34.934
BUT IT WOULD STATE THAT THERE

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:36.736
WOULD BE THAT NEED TO BE ABLE

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:38.972
TO HAVE. YOU KNOW TO-

01:54:39.038 --> 01:54:43.209
SIGNIFICANT- AREAS OF JUST- OF

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:45.044
DELAYS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE

01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:47.647
IDENTIFIED BY THE PHOENICIANS.

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:49.349
SO WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:54:49.415 --> 01:54:51.217
SEEING HOW WE CAN DISRUPT AND

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:53.553
THIS- TREND THAT WE HAVE AS

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:54.487

WE'RE REALLY REALLY EXCITED

01:55:04.097 --> 01:55:06.065
ABOUT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:55:06.132 --> 01:55:07.267
WITH OUR DISPARITY FUNDS

PROGRAM IS A REMINDER. ELEVEN

01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:13.273

WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT.

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:40.667

IS NOT ACCESSING SERVICES- ONE

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:23.042
OF THE OTHER FINDINGS THAT-

THE FINAL BUDGET ACTS OF THOSE

02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:11.297
YEARS- I MENTION THIS BECAUSE

02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:13.265
UNLIKE MOST OTHER SERVICES

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:28.647
NOT ALIGN WITH- PREVIOUS- A

LEGISLATIVE. ACTION AND INTENT-

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:34.887
SO IT- REGARDLESS TO THE EXTENT

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:36.422
THAT THESE OTHER PROPOSALS THAT

02:06:36.488 --> 02:06:39.458
ARE IN THE MAY REVISION- LEAD

02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:41.126
TO IMPROVED ACCESS AND

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:43.062

SEEMS TO REFLECT LEGISLATIVE

02:06:44.897 --> 02:06:46.832
PRIORITIES. ANOTHER AREA OF A

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.600
OF POTENTIAL ALIGNMENT IS IN

02:06:48.667 --> 02:06:50.769

SEEM IN LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE

02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:20.933

HOLIDAY SCHEDULE. THERE ARE A

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:36.915
FEW KEY AREAS WHERE- I

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.851
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES ARE NOT

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:41.020
INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAIN

02:07:41.086 --> 02:07:42.988
REVISION THE FIRST I'D MENTION

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:56.902
IDENTIFIED ISSUES IN THE

02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:58.037
CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE MADE

02:07:58.103 --> 02:07:59.505
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

02:07:59.571 --> 02:08:01.440
HOW TO IMPROVE IT AN ESTIMATED

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:02.941
THAT IT WOULD COST TO THE STATE

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:04.743
AROUND ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.645

TOTALING MORE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:13.652
INCREASES TOTALING MORE THAN

02:08:13.719 --> 02:08:14.420
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN

OF A RATE REFORM HAVE NOT. THE

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:24.463
SECOND AREA WHERE I WOULD NOTE-

02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:26.265
THAT SPENDING REVISION DOES NOT

02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:27.299
NECESSARILY ALIGNED WITH

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:30.969
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. IS IN

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:33.972

THREE EXPRESSED IT'S-

02:08:59.331 --> 02:09:01.066

THESE DIRECTIVES ITS ME SIX

02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:04.470
HEARING. THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:09:04.536 --> 02:09:05.971
MAY REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE

02:09:06.038 --> 02:09:08.607

CODIFICATION OF DIRECTIVES- I

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.044
WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:14.980
NOTING- SOME ISSUES THAT OUR

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:16.715
OFFICE HAS IDENTIFIED IN SOME

02:09:16.782 --> 02:09:18.150
OF THE PROPOSALS THAT MEET

02:09:18.217 --> 02:09:20.152
REVISION. THE FIRST CONCERNS

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:21.487
THE PROPOSED PERFORMANCE

02:09:21.553 --> 02:09:23.922
INCENTIVES PROGRAM WHICH WAS

02:09:23.989 --> 02:09:26.859
FIRST PROPOSED IN A GOVERNOR'S

02:09:26.925 --> 02:09:29.828
BUDGET IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE DO

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:30.996
BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL

02:09:31.063 --> 02:09:33.132
LIKELY HAS MERIT IF IT'S DONE

02:09:33.198 --> 02:09:34.733
IF IT'S DONE WELL WE DON'T HAVE

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:36.034
A LOT OF DETAILS OF HOW IT

02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:38.470
WOULD WORK JUST YET. HOWEVER WE

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:40.439
DID HAVE CONCERNS IN TWENTY

02:09:40.506 --> 02:09:42.474
TWENTY THAT STILL REMAIN SO

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:43.709
UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:45.244
SYSTEM ARE NUMEROUS CHALLENGES

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.379
STRAIN THE SYSTEM INCLUDING

02:09:47.446 --> 02:09:49.314
SERVICE PROVIDER RATE ISSUES.

AND SERVICE COORDINATOR TWO

02:09:50.516 --> 02:09:52.351
CONSUMER CASELOAD RATIOS THAT

02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:54.386
ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. WE HAVE

02:09:54.453 --> 02:09:57.389
TO WONDER IF THE- PROGRAM WOULD

02:09:57.456 --> 02:09:58.357
NOT NECESSARILY HAVE A

02:09:58.423 --> 02:09:59.892
FOUNDATION CONDUCIVE TO

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:02.594
SUCCESS. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING

02:10:02.661 --> 02:10:04.129
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS BASED

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:05.497
ON THE REMARKS OF DIRECTOR

02:10:05.564 --> 02:10:07.366
BARGE MINIMUM GONNA GO. THAT

02:10:07.432 --> 02:10:09.635
FUNDING WOULD BE INCLUDED- IN

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.069
SUBSEQUENT YEARS WELL THE FIRST

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:13.839
YEAR WOULD BE FOR PLANNING AND

02:10:13.906 --> 02:10:14.773
THEN IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS THERE

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:16.408
WOULD BE SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:21.013
FOR- TO HIRE MORE SERVICE

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:22.781
COORDINATORS. IT IS WE WOULD

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:23.448
KNOW THAT IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO

02:10:23.515 --> 02:10:26.151
SPEND A YEAR PLANNING- THIS

02:10:26.218 --> 02:10:26.818
PROGRAM PRIOR TO

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:28.687
IMPLEMENTATION. BUT IT'S NOT

02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:30.522
NECESSARILY CLEAR TO US WHY THE

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:31.690
STATE WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:33.425
WAIT A YEAR TO FIND MORE

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:34.860
SERVICE COORDINATORS WHEN THIS

02:10:34.927 --> 02:10:36.995
IS A CLEARLY IDENTIFIED PROBLEM

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:40.165
IN THE SYSTEM. I'M FINALLY- WE

02:10:40.232 --> 02:10:41.934
WOULD NOTE THAT ACROSS THE

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.435

SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:54.079

LACKS SUFFICIENT DETAIL ABOUT

02:10:55.847 --> 02:10:57.449
HOW THE FISCAL ESTIMATE WAS

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:59.484
DERIVED AND WHETHER THAT'S AN

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:02.154
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT- AND HOW THE

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:46.798
TO WORK WITH THE I. D. D.

02:11:46.865 --> 02:11:49.001
POPULATION. AND NOT ONE OF MY

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:51.603
CITIES ACTUALLY HAD THE ABILITY

02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:53.739
OR ANY PROGRAM FOR ANYBODY WITH

02:11:53.805 --> 02:11:57.876
DISABILITIES. NOBODY. SO THIS

02:11:57.943 --> 02:12:00.312
IS IMPERATIVE A PROGRAM THAT

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:02.281
NEEDS TO BE FUNDED AGAIN WITH

02:12:02.347 --> 02:12:04.149
THE INCLUSION AND ALSO THE

02:12:04.216 --> 02:12:06.084
DIVERSITY CAN OCCUR THE SELF

02:12:06.151 --> 02:12:07.286
ESTEEM THE DIGNITY THERE

02:12:07.352 --> 02:12:10.389
PROVIDES SOCIALIZING I COULD GO

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:12.057
ON AND ON AND ON BUT THIS IS A

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:13.859
PROGRAM THAT REALLY DOES NEED

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:17.763
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ADOPTED ANY

02:12:17.829 --> 02:12:18.764
WHERE. ELSE IN THE STATE.

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:22.301
COUNTY CITY ANYWHERE ELSE. SO I

02:12:22.367 --> 02:12:22.801
WOULD HOPE THAT WE AS A

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:25.937
COMMITTEE- MAKE THAT IMPRESSION

02:12:26.004 --> 02:12:29.041
VERY LARGE THEN THIS IS. MORTON

02:12:29.107 --> 02:12:33.078
FACET. AND I APPRECIATE ONE OF

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:33.545
THINGS I HAVE TO JUST

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:36.148
ACKNOWLEDGE. IS THE FLEXIBILITY

02:12:36.214 --> 02:12:38.250
THAT- DDS AFFORDED THE

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:41.353
PROVIDERS DURING THE PANDEMIC I

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:41.987
TO BE ABLE TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE

02:12:42.054 --> 02:12:45.657
BOX AND- WORK- TO ADAPT TO THE

02:12:45.724 --> 02:12:46.825
NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE

02:12:46.892 --> 02:12:48.660
SO. YOU KNOW KUDOS TO THE

02:12:48.727 --> 02:12:51.063
DEPARTMENT ON THAT IT WAS A

02:12:51.129 --> 02:12:51.496
GAME CHANGER FOR OUR

02:12:51.563 --> 02:12:55.567
POPULATION- THE- THE EARLY

02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:59.504
START PROGRAM. TO ME IS JUST

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:01.039
ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:03.642
THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR FOR YOUNG

02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:04.976
CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:06.978
DETERMINED TO HAVE AUTISM UP

02:13:07.045 --> 02:13:11.550
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE

02:13:11.616 --> 02:13:14.052
AMOUNT OF CHILDREN THAT ARE.

02:13:14.119 --> 02:13:16.555
PRECLUDED FROM AN I. E. P. OR

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:21.159

MOVE ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:32.537
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:34.506
AT LEAST DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:36.975
INVESTMENT TO CAPTURES MUCH OF

ABLE TO- PUSH THAT OF GOING FOR

BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:50.922
INVESTMENT WE MAKE IN OUR FIRST

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:51.490

HAPPEN WHEN WE CONTINUE TO MAKE

02:13:58.630 --> 02:14:00.599
THAT INVESTMENT. THERE THE

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:04.369
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE- THE

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:06.571
DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS IN AN

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:10.709
SENSE TO ME. AS I AGREE WITH

02:14:10.776 --> 02:14:12.911
THE L. A. O. WE HAVE THIS

02:14:12.978 --> 02:14:14.413

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.121
KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD

02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:24.723
TO BE ABLE TO. ADD THAT

02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:26.158
ADDITIONAL A HUNDRED WE'RE AT

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:26.858
NINE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING I

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:30.328
BELIEVE SHORT.RIGHT NOW- BUT

02:14:30.395 --> 02:14:32.264
WE'VE WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO

02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:35.400

02:14:52.417 --> 02:14:54.719
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PURPOSE OF

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THINK

02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:06.504
ONTO MR ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:09.173
FRAZIER'S POINT- WE WANT TO

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.675
SUPPORT ALL OF THE BILL NUMBER

02:24:10.742 --> 02:24:12.643
COMMUNITIES AND IN THIS CASE

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:14.645
THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY BUT AND

02:24:14.712 --> 02:24:15.947
THE LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE I'VE

02:24:16.014 --> 02:24:17.048
BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE I THINK

02:24:17.115 --> 02:24:19.083
THE THEME ACROSS. ALL OF THE

02:24:19.150 --> 02:24:20.051
PROGRAMS IS THAT WE'RE NOT

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:22.587
PAYING PROVIDERS- YOU KNOW A

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:23.921
SUSTAINABLE WEIGHT OR IN SOME

02:24:23.988 --> 02:24:27.658
CASES A LIVABLE WAGE SO WE-

02:24:27.725 --> 02:24:30.461
WANT TO- SUPPORT ALL OF THESE

02:24:30.528 --> 02:24:32.463
COMMUNITIES BUT IF WE DON'T PAY

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:34.499
OUR OUR PROVIDERS ENOUGH FOR-

02:24:34.565 --> 02:24:36.034
IT'S ONE THING TO TRAIN THEM

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.502
BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE LIVABLE

02:24:37.568 --> 02:24:40.471
WAGES- BUT TURNOVER HAS BEEN

02:24:40.538 --> 02:24:42.840
REALLY REALLY HIGH. IN ALL OF

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:44.108
THE PROGRAMS NOT JUST THIS

02:24:44.175 --> 02:24:45.276
PARTICULAR PROGRAM I HAVE A

02:24:45.343 --> 02:24:48.012
BILL FOR FFA'S- TO TRY TO GET

02:24:48.079 --> 02:24:50.348
HIM BACK TO A LIVABLE WAGE BY.

02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:51.816
YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD OR

02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:53.751
EVEN NOW ARE WE EVEN

02:24:53.818 --> 02:24:55.219
CONSIDERING REINSTATING A LOT

02:24:55.286 --> 02:24:56.921
OF THESE- SALARIES THAT WERE

02:24:56.988 --> 02:25:00.124
CUT- OR THE PROVIDER- FEES THAT

02:25:00.191 --> 02:25:01.392
WERE CUT BUT EVEN MOVING

02:25:01.459 --> 02:25:03.027
FORWARD I THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:04.195
IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:05.630
EVERY TIME THAT YOU KNOW

02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:06.130
THERE'S SOME KIND OF A

02:25:06.197 --> 02:25:09.867
BUDGETARY ISSUE. WE ARE QUICK

02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:11.836
TO CUT THE PAY OF THE PROVIDERS

02:25:11.903 --> 02:25:15.173
AND WE CAN NOT HAVE OUTCOMES-

02:25:15.239 --> 02:25:17.075
IF WE KEEP DOING THAT THE

02:25:17.141 --> 02:25:18.676
CONTINUITY FORCED SOME OF THE

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:20.211
VULNERABLE PUBLIC POPULATIONS

02:25:20.278 --> 02:25:22.146
MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE I'M A

02:25:22.213 --> 02:25:23.514
FORMER TEACHER AND I CAN TELL

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:25.116
YOU THAT A LOT OF THOSE. THE

02:25:25.183 --> 02:25:27.652
STUDENTS THAT I SAW BOUNCED

02:25:27.718 --> 02:25:29.353
FROM HOUE TO HOUSE SEARCH IN

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:31.589
THIS CASE IN SOME CASES FROM

02:25:31.656 --> 02:25:33.791
SCHOOL TO SCHOOL AND THOSE WERE

02:25:33.858 --> 02:25:34.559
THE KIDS THAT I SAW THERE WERE

02:25:34.625 --> 02:25:37.995
MORE- FARTHER BEHIND OR HAD A

02:25:38.062 --> 02:25:41.799
LOT OF ISSUES. AND THOSE ARE

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:44.469
THE SITUATION I'M PRESENTING

02:25:44.535 --> 02:25:45.603
RIGHT NOW WAS BECAUSE THE

02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:47.839
FAMILIES WERE MOVING RIGHT SO

02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:49.307
THAT THOSE ARE THE REASONS IN

02:25:49.373 --> 02:25:51.342
THESE CASES WERE NOT PROVIDING

02:25:51.409 --> 02:25:53.377
ENOUGH- SUPPORT FOR THE

02:25:53.444 --> 02:25:55.346
PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY DON'T

02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:57.648
HAVE TO MOVE ON- BECAUSE THEY

02:25:57.715 --> 02:25:59.016
ARE TRYING TO JUST FEED THEIR

02:25:59.083 --> 02:26:02.687
OWN FAMILIES. ARE TRYING TO

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:03.287
SURVIVE AND SO I AT WHAT POINT

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:04.555
IN AGAIN WE HAVE A- WE'VE SAID

02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:05.423
IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS IS

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:06.891
A ONCE IN A. GENERATION

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:08.593
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME OF

02:26:08.659 --> 02:26:11.496
THESE ISSUES COVER RIGHT- YOU

02:26:11.562 --> 02:26:12.530
KNOW ALL THE THEME FOR THE

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:14.932
PANDEMIC THAT THEME FOR. FOR

02:26:14.999 --> 02:26:17.034
RECOVERY IS GETTING PEOPLE OUT

02:26:17.101 --> 02:26:18.436
OF POVERTY GET IN LIFTING

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:20.438
PEOPLE OUT. SO WE CANNOT LIFT

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:23.207
PEOPLE UP OF WE DON'T ALSO LEFT

02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:25.443
OF PROVIDERS UP AND TO MR

02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:27.044
FRASER'S POINT. YES THE

02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:28.412
TRAINING IS REALLY CRITICAL

02:26:28.479 --> 02:26:30.414
INCENTIVES ARE CRITICAL SO THAT

02:26:30.481 --> 02:26:32.316
THE CONTINUITY FOR ALL OF THESE

02:26:32.383 --> 02:26:36.120
POPULATIONS- YOU KNOW CONTINUE

02:26:36.187 --> 02:26:37.788
IN SEOUL. SO I JUST WANTED TO

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:38.923
MAKE THAT STATEMENT BUT ALSO

02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:42.894
WOULD LIKE TO- THINK ABOUT OR

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.829
ARE IS ARE ARE DEPARTMENTS

02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:46.164
REALLY THINKING ABOUT RESTORING

02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:49.467
SOME OF THOSE THOSE- PROVIDER

02:26:49.534 --> 02:26:53.604
WAGES ARE PROVIDER- MONIES. SO

02:26:53.671 --> 02:26:55.473
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:57.275
SERVICES THAT WE'RE REQUESTING

02:26:57.341 --> 02:26:58.209
YOU KNOW FROM ALL OF OUR

02:26:58.276 --> 02:27:00.144
PROGRAMS IN THIS CASE- BUT TO

02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:01.546
MR FRASER'S POINT THE IDT

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.881
POPULATION AND- YOU KNOW JUST-

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:05.983
OUR FOSTER KIDS ALL OF THOSE.

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:07.552
ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

02:27:07.618 --> 02:27:08.753
NEEDS CONTINUITY AND IF WE

02:27:08.819 --> 02:27:13.624
DON'T PROVIDE THE LIVING WAGES-

02:27:13.691 --> 02:27:15.059
TO THOSE PROVIDERS THEN WE'RE

WATER SITUATION WAS GONNA BE IN

03:12:32.674 --> 03:12:36.811
A BILLION. AND I'M JUST ASKING

03:12:36.878 --> 03:12:40.882
CST USED. THE WATER BOND THAT

03:12:40.949 --> 03:12:43.118
WAS BROUGHT OUT IN TWENTY

03:12:43.184 --> 03:12:44.019
THIRTEEN THE WAS FIVE POINT

03:12:44.085 --> 03:12:46.054
SOMETHING BILLION DOLLARS WAS

03:12:46.121 --> 03:12:47.889
POSED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE

03:12:47.956 --> 03:12:49.658
ISSUES AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN

03:12:49.724 --> 03:12:51.559
WITH ANOTHER BILLION IS THERE

03:12:51.626 --> 03:12:54.863
ANY KIND OF FACTOR FIG FIGURE

03:12:54.930 --> 03:12:56.631
THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO WHERE WE

03:12:56.698 --> 03:12:58.366
NEED TO BE TO GIVE PEOPLE

03:12:58.433 --> 03:13:02.137
RELIABLE CLEAN WATER SOURCES- I

03:13:02.203 --> 03:13:03.738
MEAN WHAT SEEMS LIKE WHAT WE

03:13:03.805 --> 03:13:06.675
THOUGHT WE WERE DOING IT IN THE

03:13:06.741 --> 03:13:07.208
WATER BOND AND HERE WE ARE

03:13:07.275 --> 03:13:10.445
AGAIN- IS. THIS GOING TO DO IT

03:13:10.512 --> 03:13:13.181
OR DO WE NEED TO ANTICIPATE FOR

03:13:13.248 --> 03:13:15.250
MORE. AND WHY DID WE GO FOR

03:13:15.317 --> 03:13:17.519
MORE NOW WHEN WE AGAIN LOOK

03:13:17.585 --> 03:13:19.854
INTO. A BUDGET SURPLUS WHERE

03:13:19.921 --> 03:13:22.857
THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT REALLY

03:13:22.924 --> 03:13:32.801
DOES BRING BACK A VALUE. I

03:13:32.867 --> 03:13:36.204
BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS FOR-

03:13:36.271 --> 03:13:37.739
ACTING DIRECTOR SCRIBNER FEAR.

03:13:37.806 --> 03:13:41.209

CONCERN. NOT ACTING DIRECTOR

03:13:58.393 --> 03:13:59.527
SCRIBNER I BELIEVE HE WAS

03:13:59.594 --> 03:14:02.764
REFERENCING ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY

03:14:02.831 --> 03:14:03.498

TO BE A FIX- OR IS THERE AN

03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:44.072
NECESSITY TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

03:14:44.139 --> 03:14:46.474

RANGE OF EIGHTY TO NINETY

03:15:10.365 --> 03:15:11.332
MILLION WE DO KNOW THAT THAT'S

03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:12.767
NOT ENOUGH TO DO WITH YOUR

ENOUGH FOR IF THERE'S GONNA BE

03:15:18.506 --> 03:15:20.208
A NEED FOR MORE I WOULD HAVE TO

03:15:20.275 --> 03:15:21.409
DEFER TO THE WATER BOARD THAT

03:15:21.476 --> 03:15:23.011
CST DOES NOT HAVE ANY OF THAT

03:15:23.078 --> 03:15:24.646

FOR. MY QUESTIONS I'M GONNA

03:15:32.887 --> 03:15:34.823
FOCUS ON ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY

03:15:34.889 --> 03:15:36.157
SIX REGARDING THE ENERGY A RE

03:15:36.224 --> 03:15:37.959
RIDGES THE BILLION DOLLARS THE

03:15:38.026 --> 03:15:41.362
STATE IS. PROPOSING AND I WAS

03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:42.263
STRUCK BY YOUR EFFECTIVE AND

03:15:42.330 --> 03:15:44.399
EFFICIENT. COMMENT OF

03:15:44.466 --> 03:15:46.534
ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. AND

03:15:46.601 --> 03:15:47.702
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE

03:15:47.769 --> 03:15:48.803
BEING BOTH CULTURALLY AND

03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:50.538
LINGUISTICALLY. COMPETENT AND

03:15:50.605 --> 03:15:51.906
OUR OUTREACH AND SO WANTED TO

03:15:51.973 --> 03:15:53.942
ASK YOU ACTING DIRECTOR HOW ARE

03:15:54.008 --> 03:15:56.578
WE ADDRESSING OUR MONO LINGUAL

03:15:56.644 --> 03:15:58.780
COMMUNITIES OR- SPECIFIC

03:15:58.847 --> 03:16:00.682
COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT NOT BE.

03:16:00.748 --> 03:16:02.717
ABLE TO TRADITIONALLY ACCESS

03:16:02.784 --> 03:16:03.918
THIS PROGRAM BUT THAT COULD

03:16:03.985 --> 03:16:05.854
GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THAT. HOW

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:07.455
ARE WE INTENTIONALLY DOING

03:16:07.522 --> 03:16:09.991
OUTREACH TO THOSE VULNERABLE

03:16:10.058 --> 03:16:13.528
COMMUNITIES. WELL THE INITIAL

03:16:13.595 --> 03:16:15.864
PROGRAM DESIGN IS AT A MUCH

03:16:15.930 --> 03:16:17.932
HIGHER LEVEL AND THAT I THINK

03:16:17.999 --> 03:16:20.702
THAT THE PLAN WOULD BE TO GET A

03:16:20.768 --> 03:16:23.371
MAJORITY OF THE LOW INCOME AND

03:16:23.438 --> 03:16:25.707
THOSE GLOBAL POPULATIONS. I'VE

03:16:25.773 --> 03:16:27.408
DEALT WITH DIRECTLY FROM THE

03:16:27.475 --> 03:16:28.710
UTILITY ITSELF AND THEN THE

03:16:28.776 --> 03:16:31.479
OUTRAGE WOULD BE. NONEXISTENT

03:16:31.546 --> 03:16:33.014
IT AND SEXUALLY THAT THEY THEY

03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:34.682
START CUSTOMERS WOULD THEN BE

03:16:34.749 --> 03:16:36.317
TAGGED AND IDENTIFIED IN AN

03:16:36.384 --> 03:16:37.986
APPLICATION TO THE DEPARTMENT.

03:16:38.052 --> 03:16:39.087
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD THEN JUST

03:16:39.154 --> 03:16:41.422
ISSUE ONE BIG CHECK AND THEY

03:16:41.489 --> 03:16:43.658
WOULD BE THEN APPLIED TO- THE

03:16:43.725 --> 03:16:45.527
ORIGINAL BALANCE IS THAT THESE

03:16:45.593 --> 03:16:47.795
CUSTOMERS HAVE. NOW IN THE

03:16:47.862 --> 03:16:50.365
AREAS OF WHERE UTILITY MAY NOT

03:16:50.431 --> 03:16:52.133
BE PARTICIPATING WITH CAP

03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:54.536
DIRECTLY WITH CSP. WHAT WE

03:16:54.602 --> 03:16:55.537
WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD

03:16:55.603 --> 03:16:57.172
DONE BEFORE- WE WOULD HAVE WE

03:16:57.238 --> 03:17:00.575
RELY ON OUR- NETWORK OF CEOS A

03:17:00.642 --> 03:17:02.610
LOCAL PROVIDERS TO DO THAT

03:17:02.677 --> 03:17:04.445
OUTRAGE AS NECESSARY AND HOW

03:17:04.512 --> 03:17:05.947
THEY BELIEVE IS THE MOST

03:17:06.014 --> 03:17:07.348
EFFICIENT WAY TO DEAL WITH IT

03:17:07.415 --> 03:17:08.316
FOR THE LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS

03:17:08.383 --> 03:17:09.350
THAT THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH

03:17:09.417 --> 03:17:11.786
FOR. DECADES UNDER THE LIKELY

03:17:11.853 --> 03:17:13.621
PROGRAM SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

03:17:13.688 --> 03:17:15.323
WE WOULD FIND ANY GAPS IN

03:17:15.390 --> 03:17:18.593
SERVICE- AND YOU BELIEVE IN AND

03:17:18.660 --> 03:17:20.228
ACTUALLY HAVE THE MICRO TO

03:17:20.295 --> 03:17:22.697
MACRO LEVEL WILL BE. ABLE TO

03:17:22.764 --> 03:17:23.464
PROVIDE SERVICES MUCH QUICKER

03:17:23.531 --> 03:17:25.200
THAN WE COULD IF IT WERE DONE

03:17:25.266 --> 03:17:31.105
ON A. ONE APPLICATION ONE

03:17:31.172 --> 03:17:32.173
CUSTOMER APPROACH- I'M

03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:32.707
ENCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU'RE

03:17:32.774 --> 03:17:34.742
SAYING REGARDING- HOW THE

03:17:34.809 --> 03:17:36.578
PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED I

03:17:36.644 --> 03:17:39.547
HAVE CONCERNS THAT- ARE

03:17:39.614 --> 03:17:41.416
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MIGHT NOT.

03:17:41.482 --> 03:17:43.218
HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND

03:17:43.284 --> 03:17:44.152

THE APPLICATIONS AND IF THAT

03:17:51.859 --> 03:17:54.162
REQUIRES US AS A STATE TO LOOK

03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:56.130

THAT OUTREACH I THINK THAT'S

03:17:59.534 --> 03:18:01.135
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS

03:18:01.202 --> 03:18:02.403
REACHING THOSE HARD TO REACH

03:18:02.470 --> 03:18:04.639
COMMUNITIES. WHO COULD GREATLY

03:26:25.139 --> 03:26:26.941
IN AS A PROVIDER YOURSELF AND

03:26:27.007 --> 03:26:28.943
BOTH YOU AND DR ARAMBULA. I

03:26:29.009 --> 03:26:30.945
THINK REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW

03:26:31.011 --> 03:26:32.213
DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:26:32.279 --> 03:26:33.781
PROVIDER HAS ALL OF THE

03:26:33.848 --> 03:26:36.751
INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO THE

03:26:36.817 --> 03:26:37.651
INDIVIDUAL SO THAT WE CAN

03:26:37.718 --> 03:26:39.787
FURTHER. IMPROVE HEALTH

03:26:39.854 --> 03:26:42.590
OUTCOMES AND FOR ME IT'S A IT'S

03:26:42.656 --> 03:26:44.358
IMPERATIVE OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE

03:26:44.425 --> 03:26:46.494
DATA THAT YOU COLLECT AN EMR OR

03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:48.562
EHR BUT IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT

03:26:48.629 --> 03:26:49.430
TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE

03:26:49.497 --> 03:26:52.066
SOCIAL. DATA WHETHER OR NOT AND

03:26:52.133 --> 03:26:53.400
SOMEONE'S GETTING ACCESS TO CAO

03:26:53.467 --> 03:26:55.903
WORKS OR CALFRESH AWAKE AND HOW

03:26:55.970 --> 03:26:58.038
THAT ALL UNDER LINES ARE UNDER

03:26:58.105 --> 03:27:00.741
CONSTABULARIES. FOR A FOR

03:27:00.808 --> 03:27:02.276
YOUTUBE TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH

03:27:02.343 --> 03:27:04.044
OUTCOMES SO THE BOTTOM LINE

03:27:04.111 --> 03:27:05.412
THAT THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION

03:27:05.479 --> 03:27:07.081
THAT'S AT THE AGENCY LEVEL IS

03:27:07.148 --> 03:27:08.415
REALLY SPECIFIC TO BUILDING

03:27:08.482 --> 03:27:10.551
SOME LEADERSHIP IN ORDER FOR US

03:27:10.618 --> 03:27:12.953
TO. AB CREEK BEGIN TO CREATE

03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:15.022
STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA AND

03:27:15.089 --> 03:27:16.791
THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR US TO

03:27:16.857 --> 03:27:18.793
CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS. TO THINK

03:27:18.859 --> 03:27:20.294
ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE OF H. I

03:27:20.361 --> 03:27:22.630
EAT AND I WOULD EXPAND HIV TO

03:27:22.696 --> 03:27:27.868
NOT JUST INCLUDE HEALTH. AND

03:27:27.935 --> 03:27:28.469
HUMAN SERVICES DATA AS WELL.

03:27:28.536 --> 03:27:29.703
OKAY I DO I GUESS I MY COM

03:27:29.770 --> 03:27:30.638
WOULD JUST BE THAN I THINK

03:27:30.704 --> 03:27:32.339
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF STUDY

03:27:32.406 --> 03:27:33.908
AROUND THIS OVER THE YEARS

03:27:33.974 --> 03:27:36.076
THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS. GROUPS

03:27:36.143 --> 03:27:37.444
OF STAKEHOLDERS BABY NOT

03:27:37.511 --> 03:27:40.514
ORGANIZED TOGETHER THAT WAY- TO

03:27:40.581 --> 03:27:43.350
WORK ON THESE ISSUES AND-

03:27:43.417 --> 03:27:44.485
THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF

03:27:44.552 --> 03:27:46.187
MONEY SPENT ON HEALTH

03:27:46.253 --> 03:27:48.622
INFORMATION- YOU KNOW-

03:27:48.689 --> 03:27:52.026
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE. SO

03:27:52.092 --> 03:27:54.495
I GUESS. I GUESS WHAT DO YOU

03:27:54.562 --> 03:27:56.130
EXPECTING THE OUTCOME TO BE

03:27:56.197 --> 03:27:57.364
BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A HUGE

03:27:57.431 --> 03:27:58.599
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION OUT

03:27:58.666 --> 03:28:00.000
THERE. WE ARE SET WE ALSO HAVE

03:28:00.067 --> 03:28:01.635
NEW GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL

03:28:01.702 --> 03:28:03.604
GOVERNMENT ABOUT. CERTAIN

03:28:03.671 --> 03:28:06.841
ADMISSIONS AND DISCHARGES AND

03:28:06.907 --> 03:28:09.910
THINGS WERE HOSPITAL SO- IN IN

03:28:09.977 --> 03:28:11.445
THE LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT

03:28:11.512 --> 03:28:14.148
DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE ACCESS

03:28:14.215 --> 03:28:15.549
TO SOME OF THIS INFORMATION

03:28:15.616 --> 03:28:16.183
WOULD HAVE BEEN HUGELY VALUABLE

03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:19.587
TO US. WHICH SIMPLY WASN'T

03:28:19.653 --> 03:28:23.891
THERE- YEAH HOW LONG DO YOU SEE

03:28:23.958 --> 03:28:25.793
THIS PROCESS GOING I MEAN. IT

03:28:25.860 --> 03:28:27.962
JUST FEELS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS

03:28:28.028 --> 03:28:30.497
LIKE WE'RE KIND OF SLOW WALKING

03:28:30.564 --> 03:28:31.065
SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOULD

03:28:31.131 --> 03:28:32.800
GET DONE SOONER. I

03:28:32.867 --> 03:28:34.001
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOUR

03:28:34.068 --> 03:28:36.370
DOCTOR WELL I DON'T THINK THE

03:28:36.437 --> 03:28:37.705
INTENTION IS TO STUDY ANYTHING

03:28:37.771 --> 03:28:38.772
BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE STUDIED

03:28:38.839 --> 03:28:40.140
IT QUITE WELL I THINK THE

03:28:40.207 --> 03:28:42.476
INTENTION HERE IS TO. BEGIN TO

03:28:42.543 --> 03:28:44.345
LOOK AT THE NATIONAL STANDARDS

03:28:44.411 --> 03:28:46.547
THE ONC STANDARDS THAT HAVE

03:28:46.614 --> 03:28:48.082
BEEN PUT OUT HOW DO WE ADD TO

03:28:48.148 --> 03:28:50.618
THOSE OR BUILD OFF OF THOSE SO

03:28:50.684 --> 03:28:52.753
THAT WE HAVE SOME LEVEL OF

03:28:52.820 --> 03:28:54.054
UNDERSTANDING AROUND HOW WE

03:28:54.121 --> 03:28:56.290
ACCELERATE THE EXCHANGE OF DATA

03:28:56.357 --> 03:28:58.592
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

03:28:58.659 --> 03:29:00.361
AND THEN REALLY BEING ABLE TO

03:29:00.427 --> 03:29:02.630
BUILD. UP A YOU KNOW AN

03:29:02.696 --> 03:29:04.832
ADVISORY BODY TO HELP GUIDE THE

03:29:04.899 --> 03:29:06.600
STATE BOTH IN THE SHARING OF

03:29:06.667 --> 03:29:08.369
OUR OWN DATA AMONGST OUR OWN

03:29:08.435 --> 03:29:09.803
DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO WHAT

03:29:09.870 --> 03:29:11.739
STANDARDS INDUSTRY CAN USE IN

03:29:11.805 --> 03:29:13.407
ORDER TO FURTHER ACCELERATE THE

03:29:13.474 --> 03:29:16.210
USE OF THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT-ON. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE

03:29:16.277 --> 03:29:18.612
PANDEMIC REALLY EACH SHIP ON A

03:29:18.679 --> 03:29:20.214
LIGHT ON THE FACT THAT THIS

03:29:20.281 --> 03:29:22.249
DATA SOMETIMES ISN'T SHARED BUT

03:29:22.316 --> 03:29:23.751
THE VALUE IN SHARING IT OR

03:29:23.817 --> 03:29:25.886
HAVING IT SHARED IN A IN A- IN

03:29:25.953 --> 03:29:27.621
A IN IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS

03:29:27.688 --> 03:29:30.658
PRIVACY. AND LOOKS AT KIND OF

03:29:30.724 --> 03:29:32.726
THE POPULATION MORE BROADLY IS

03:29:32.793 --> 03:29:34.428
PARAMOUNT TO US BEING ABLE TO

03:29:34.495 --> 03:29:35.896
DO THAT SO OUR GOAL HERE REALLY

03:29:35.963 --> 03:29:37.031
IS TAKE CELEBRATE THIS AS

03:29:37.097 --> 03:29:39.266
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER

03:29:39.333 --> 03:29:40.501
FOR US TO REALLY BE ABLE TO

03:29:40.567 --> 03:29:42.169
DELIVER ON THIS VISION OF

03:29:42.236 --> 03:29:44.171
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. SO

03:29:44.238 --> 03:29:45.873
JUST A FOLLOW UP TO THAT SO IS

03:29:45.940 --> 03:29:49.643
THIS- IS THIS MEANT TO BE MORE

03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:51.512
INTROSPECTIVE OF STATE

03:29:51.578 --> 03:29:53.414
GOVERNMENT OR ARE YOU LOOKING

03:29:53.480 --> 03:29:54.748
AT A STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT

03:29:54.815 --> 03:29:57.952
INVOLVES A BROADER A BROADER- I

03:29:58.018 --> 03:30:00.154
NEED. IT I GUESS IN MY MIND

03:30:00.220 --> 03:30:01.055
THESE KINDS OF THINGS DON'T

03:30:01.121 --> 03:30:03.190
WORK UNLESS EVERYBODY'S IN AND

03:30:03.257 --> 03:30:05.459
SO- SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT

03:30:05.526 --> 03:30:06.493
SOMETHING THIS IS GOING TO HELP

03:30:06.560 --> 03:30:07.895
WITH OUR STATE DATA THAT'S NOT

03:30:07.962 --> 03:30:09.196
THAT DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME

03:30:09.263 --> 03:30:10.564
BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY A THIRD OF

03:30:10.631 --> 03:30:12.566
THE POPULATION. AND SAID YEAH

03:30:12.633 --> 03:30:14.001
AND IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE

03:30:14.068 --> 03:30:16.036
STATE IT'S FULLY ENCOMPASSING

03:30:16.103 --> 03:30:17.471
SO I THINK WE WANT TO ENGAGE

03:30:17.538 --> 03:30:19.006
WITH OTHER H. I. EASE H. I.

03:30:19.073 --> 03:30:21.041

MAKE THIS AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE

03:30:24.378 --> 03:30:25.813
THE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO JUST

03:30:25.879 --> 03:30:31.318
FOCUS ON STATE. AT THE EXCHANGE

03:30:31.385 --> 03:30:33.954

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAYS IN

03:30:51.839 --> 03:30:53.040
WHICH WE CAN BREAK DOWN SOME OF

03:30:53.107 --> 03:30:55.442
THE SILOS BETWEEN HHS AND

03:30:55.509 --> 03:30:57.711

OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING

03:32:10.851 --> 03:32:12.719
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT MANY

03:32:12.786 --> 03:32:14.555
INDIVIDUALS ARE ACCESSING

03:32:14.621 --> 03:32:16.056

AGENCY AND MANY OF THESE

03:32:19.626 --> 03:32:21.662
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:32:21.728 --> 03:32:22.796
DEVELOPED IN THE SILENT

03:33:12.679 --> 03:33:15.182
MEDICAID SYSTEM- THAT REALLY

03:33:15.249 --> 03:33:16.617
LOOKS AT SERVING THE NEEDS OF

03:33:16.683 --> 03:33:18.085
THE INDIVIDUALS AND WORKING

03:33:18.152 --> 03:33:20.287
MORE UPSTREAM. WE TALK A LOT

03:33:20.354 --> 03:33:21.755
ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF

03:33:21.822 --> 03:33:24.258
HEALTH AND SO PART OF THIS IT

03:33:24.324 --> 03:33:25.626
PROPOSAL WOULD WITH REGARDS TO

03:33:25.692 --> 03:33:27.194
CALLIN IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT

03:33:27.261 --> 03:33:28.896
HOW DO WE ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

03:33:28.962 --> 03:33:30.464
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

03:33:30.531 --> 03:33:32.299
AND MAKE A MEDICAID AND

03:33:32.366 --> 03:33:34.301
EQUALIZER AND YOU KNOW NOT NOT

03:33:34.368 --> 03:33:36.370
EQUITY TOOL IN MANY WAYS. AND

03:33:36.436 --> 03:33:38.972
SO OUR INTENT MOVING FORWARD.

03:33:39.039 --> 03:33:40.974
IS REALLY LOOKING AT WAYS IN

03:33:41.041 --> 03:33:43.377
WHICH WE CAN CROSS AB PROGRAMS

03:33:43.443 --> 03:33:45.679
CROSS DEPARTMENTS LOOK AT THE

03:33:45.746 --> 03:33:47.214
INDIVIDUAL SILOS BREAK THEM

03:33:47.281 --> 03:33:48.916
DOWN SO THAT ARE UNDERLYING

03:33:48.982 --> 03:33:50.717
FOCUS IS ON THE PEOPLE WERE

03:33:50.784 --> 03:33:51.952
TRYING TO SERVE AND THEIR

03:33:52.019 --> 03:33:53.754
NEEDS. NOT THE BUREAUCRATIC

03:33:53.820 --> 03:33:55.322
STRUCTURES OR PROGRAMMATIC

03:33:55.389 --> 03:33:56.256
STRUCTURES THAT WE'VE

03:33:56.323 --> 03:33:57.591
ESTABLISHED BECAUSE OF

03:33:57.658 --> 03:33:59.626
CONVENIENCE AND SO I THINK THAT

03:33:59.693 --> 03:34:00.827
IS GOING TO BE WHAT WHERE WE

03:34:00.894 --> 03:34:03.163
DRIVE TOWARDS. I THINK THAT

03:34:03.230 --> 03:34:04.665
THIS BUDGET BEGINS TO LAY THE

03:34:04.731 --> 03:34:07.267
GROUNDWORK TOWARD SAD WHEN YOU

03:34:07.334 --> 03:34:09.069
LOOK AT THE THEMES OF OUR- ARMY

03:34:09.136 --> 03:34:10.470
REVISION INVESTMENTS THEY KIND

03:34:10.537 --> 03:34:12.406
OF UNDERLINE SIX DIFFERENT

03:34:12.472 --> 03:34:14.541
TEAMS IN THE CROSS. EACH OF THE

03:34:14.608 --> 03:34:16.176
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY

03:34:16.243 --> 03:34:18.445
AB AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS

03:34:18.512 --> 03:34:19.646
GOING TO BE REALLY WHAT THE

03:34:19.713 --> 03:34:22.015
