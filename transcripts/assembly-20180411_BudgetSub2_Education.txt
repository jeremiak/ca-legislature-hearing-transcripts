START THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY AS OUR. FINANCIAL AID HEARING WE KNOWS THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY IN THE ROOM EVERYONE LIKES TO TALK ABOUT FINANCIAL AID EVERYONE'S HAPPY ABOUT. THE. WHAT THE ISSUES THAT WE FOCUS ON HERE AND YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE REALLY PROUD THAT WE SPENT? OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR TO A LOW INCOME STUDENTS ATTEND COLLEGE. WE HAVE OF COURSE ARE OUR WORKERS PROGRAM IS THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM SERVING OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS EVERY YEAR COVERING TUITION. FOR MOST OF THE STUDENTS. WE HAVE OUR FIVE YEAR OLD MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM SERVING MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS EVERY YEAR. WRITING TUITION DISCOUNTS FOR BOTH LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS. THAT WE'VE ALSO STEPPED UP THE LAST. FEW YEARS WITH THE AYE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID NOW PROVIDING ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN AID TO PAY FOR. BOOKS HOUSING AND OTHER COTS. BUT WE KNOW THAT DESPITE. THESE INVESTMENTS. NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO ANY GAP STILL EXISTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND LOW INCOME STUDENTS DON'T QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT OR. THOSE THAT DO. ITS NOT THE TUITION THAT REALLY HAMMERS THEM IT'S THAT HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AND BOOKS. FOOD THE OTHER HALF COSTS OF COLLEGE SO WE STARTED THIS DISCUSSION TWO YEARS AGO TO LOOK AT HOW WE COULD. REIMAGINE FINANCIAL AID LOOK AT THE REALITIES WOULD IT COST TO ATTEND COLLEGE A CONTINUE THAT SERVING MORE STUDENTS IN OUR CAL GRANT. AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS BUT THINK ABOUT WAYS HOW WE CAN FUNDS OF THE NON TUITION. AT COST SO WE HAD WE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AS I SAID FOR TWO YEARS WE ASK THIS DEBATE COMMISSION TO. COMMISSION A US STUDY TO LOOK AT OPTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY BIG PART OF THE AGENDA TODAY WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT. AS WELL AS OTHER AND MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIALLY AND CAL GRANT ISSUES SO BUT FOR TO TODAY'S HEARING. AND WITH THAT WE WILL PROCEED. SO THE FIRST FIRST ISSUE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ROLL JUST YET NOT A QUORUM HERE. THE FIRST ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER ONE REFORMING CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID WILL HAVE A PANEL. SYSTEM WHO ARE PART OF OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IMMIGRANTS TORT ONE CHAIRS WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT REAL QUICK. GO GET YOUR FROM NEXT TO US ANTI. SO MAYBE THAT LUPITA YOU CAN HELP THE US ARTISTS OFTEN AND FRAME THE ISSUE WE'RE. TALKING ABOUT TODAY SIR. BUT YOU BE THE COURT THERE'S LIKE A LOT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS WERE HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY. TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OF THE REPORT THAT BOB SHARMAN WITH THE CENTURY FOUNDATIONS AND THE BOMB AND OTHERS WERE ABLE TO COMMISSION WITH ME TODAY TO IS OUR CHAIR LANDET I JUST SAY. WHO'S HERE ALSO TO HELP PRESENT SO THE ISSUE AT HAND REALLY IS THAT YOU KNOW. I I CAME ONBOARD ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO TWO YEARS ABOUT FEW MONTHS AND. THE ISSUE AROUND FOOD AND HOUSING IN SECURITY FOR STUDENTS AND THE COST OF ATTENDANCE HAS REALLY. REALLY SUNSHINE SKYROCKETED. THE ISSUE HAS BALLOONED INTO I'M REALLY ANALYZING WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO AS A STATE TO HELP SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL AID AND HOW EASY IS IT TO UNDERSTAND AND ADMINISTER. AND AS WELL AS DOES THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS SO WERE US SEEING THAT STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY SOME STUDENTS ARE. NOT GOING ON TO COLLEGE BECAUSE THEY EVEN WITH THE AID THAT THE STATE PROVIDES AS JENNER SAID IT IS AND IT IS THE MOST GENEROUS IN THE NATION. IT'S NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE OF OUR COST OF ATTENDANCE SO. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I REALLY WANT POP TO GOING TO GOING TO SOME OF THE. COMPONENTS OF THE REPORT AND THEN OUR CHAIR LODDIGES IS GOING TO GO INTO SOME OF THE PROPOSALS. THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT IN THE IMMEDIATE AND THEN I'LL GO INTO THE SECOND AND THIRD PHASES OF OF THE ROADMAP. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. WE STARTED OUR WORK ON THIS REPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WITH UMPQUA PULLING BACK THE LENDS A LITTLE BETTER IN RECOGNIZING THAT THE UNDERLYING PER EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. AS A POTENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENT AND THINK ABOUT HOW OUT WHAT ROLE CAN THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM PLAY IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERY. ANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHO'S INTERESTED IN COLLEGE TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND AND TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND IN A WAY THAT CAN BE. SUCCESSFUL FOR THEM IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT. FAMILY FINANCIAL SITUATIONS ARE NOT A BARRIER TO IBM ALL TO ATTEND COLLEGE IT MEANS THAT THOSE POTENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE VIABLE OPTIONS. AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT THOSE ARE AFFORDABLE. AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. DECISIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS BASED ON THAT INFORMATION SO WHAT MATTERS WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE KIND THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. OUR WORK OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS RESULTED IN EVERY REPORT THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE OR HAVE ACCESS TO IT IS A LENGTHY SO I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO A TO EVERY. DETAIL. TO GIVE YOU SORT OF A SENSE OF WHERE IT WHERE IT INTENDS TO GET TO. AFTER FULLY IMPLEMENTING EVERYTHING THE REPORT THERE ARE REALLY TWO MAIN THEMES ONE IS. FOR THE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO HAVE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL AID ENOUGH GRANT AID SO THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE. THE NEED THEY CAN GO TO COLLEGE WITHOUT THE NEED TO EITHER WORK EXCESSIVELY OR TOLD OR TO BORROW THE. BEYOND WHAT IS A REASONABLE AMOUNT TO BORROW ALL AND PREFERABLY TO NOT HAVE TO BORROW AT ALL IF WE CAN GET TO THAT POINT THAT IN OF ENOUGH. GRANT AID IS ONE GOAL THE SECOND GOAL IS FOR THAT GRANTED A TO BE DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT IS. EFFECTIVE AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE EFFECTIVE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIMING AND CONTENT AND DELIVERY OF INFORMATION. TO THOSE POTENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS IN THE STATE. IS THIS IS SUCH THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THINGS LIKE WHETHER TO WHETHER TO CONVEY THEIR TO CONSIDER A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE OR A CAREER TECH PROGRAM KNOWING WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM. KNOWING THAT THEY CAN UP CAN APPLY AND COULD POTENTIALLY AFFORD YOU SEE CSU PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHETHER TO ATTEND FULL TIME HOW MUCH TO WORK. AND BEING ABLE AND HAVING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED DEBT IN ORDER TO DECIDE WHETHER TO APPLY TO COLLEGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. A LOT OF. MUCH OF THE BE. OPERATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND AT. OPERATES NOW ON THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED. IS TOO LATE TO INFLUENCE THOSE DECISIONS MUCH OF IT COMES AFTER PEOPLE ALREADY APPLIED AND WE'RE TELLING THEM HOW MUCH THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR IN EIGHT AROUND AND WHETHER THEY'VE AFTER THEY'VE. JUST MADE THE DECISION TO APPLY TO YOU SEE YOUR CSU WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT A FAMILY THAT MIGHT BE WRONGLY ASSUMING. THAT. UC RCS YOU ARE PRIVATE COLLEGE IS NOT AFFORDABLE OR A OR A. UPPER AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILY THAT MIGHT BE WRONGLY ASSUMING THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOT AN APPROPRIATE OPTION FOR THEM. HAS EARLY KAT INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP TO INFLUENCE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE THE FULL RANGE OF OPTIONS IN FRONT OF THEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. THOSE FULLY INFORMED. DECISIONS. SO A CORE RECOMMENDATION OF THE REPORT IS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION TO ENGAGE IN A PROCESS OF PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH EARLY COMPREHENSIVE AND PERSONALIZED COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID INFORMATION. THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE COLLEGE COSTS NOT JUST TUITION AND PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH COMPARATIVE INFORMATION ACROSS DIFFERENT KINDS OF INSTITUTIONS. IN THE STATE GETTING AHEAD OF SOME OF THE CURRENT. INFORMATION AND PROCESSES THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE OUT THERE. SECOND IS TO AS A PART OF THE THIS. CORE RECOMMENDATION IS AN INNOVATION FUND SO THAT THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION CAN TEST DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO PROVIDING FINANCIAL AID AND TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF PROVIDING AID. DIFFERENT PERHAPS DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IN DIFFERENT. KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES SO THAT KIND OF GETS AT THE INFORMATION AND EFFECTIVENESS SIDE OF OF. IMPROVING FINANCIAL AID. THERE WE ALSO HAVE A NEED FOR MORE FINANCIAL AID AND. THERE WE ARE RECOMMENDING AND INCREASED. STATE INVESTMENT. PARTICULARLY NEEDED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALSO SOME NEED AT. AT C. S. U. YOU SEE IN THE AND THE AND THE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. BUT WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED IN PARTICULAR WHERE WHERE THE BIGGEST GAPS ARE ARE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND. WE ARE RECOMMENDING A COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL AND SIMPLIFICATION OF CAL GRANT IN GENERAL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME IT CAN'T BE IMPLEMENTED THIS COMING FALL PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL AID AWARDS AND EVERYTHING. BUT ONE FIRST STEP THAT CAN BE TAKEN IS TO IN IS TO. EXPAND THE. CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD. WHICH LARGELY GOES O A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO WE SEE THAT AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD WHAT WOULD THEN BE. A MORE COMPREHENSIVE A CONSOLIDATION OF CAL GRANT A. B. AND C.. WE'RE RECOMMENDING ELIMINATING THE USE OF OF GPA AND. TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND AGE LIMITS. AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT EVERY POTENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENT AND SO THAT WE CAN SEE EVERY EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. AS A POTENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENT AND A POTENTIAL COLLEGE. GRADUATE. I'M GONNA STOP THERE THERE'S A LOT MORE DETAIL. THAN THAT BUT. TRADED OVER TO. LONDON THAT RIGHT. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY FOR HAVING THIS HEARING MY NAME IS LANDED JUST SAYING I'M THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA STILL NAY COMMISSION AND I'D FIRST LIKE TO START BY THANKING OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION. OF FOR THEIR EXPEDITED WORK ON THIS REPORT. WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING BOTH THE COMMISSIONERS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE ENOUGH TIME TO FULLY CONSIDER THE POLICY AND PROGRAMMATIC IN THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE REPORT. WE DECIDED TO ACTUALLY AT THE BAPTIST DO NAY COMMISSION TO TAKE THE REPORT AND KIND OF THREE PHASES. PHASE ONE REALLY SPEAKS TO WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE NEAR TERM PARTICULARLY GIVEN I'M CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSALS FACE TO WE WILL BE CONSIDERING THAT ARE ARE MEETING IN JUNE. AND THAT REALLY IS THE LARGER PART WHICH CHARMIN SPOKE OF RELATED TO CONSOLIDATION AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE VARIOUS MEANS OF RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT SOMETIME FORM BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS ACTUALLY EVEN WANTING TO APPLY. OR UNDERSTANDING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE THE THIRD PHASE WILL REALLY SPEAK MUCH BROUGHT MORE BROADLY TO ISSUES RELATED TO THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. AND WHAT WE AS A STATE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST DODD MEETING STUDENTS NEEDS IN TERMS OF FEES AND OR TUITION BUT THERE WERE REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE COST DRIVERS ARE. THAT PREVENT STUDENTS ROM ATTENDING COLLEGE AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS IN STUDENTS ACTUALLY SPEAK TO THOSE TO THOSE ISSUES. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'VE FOCUSED ON A LAST WEEK WE MET ON APRIL THIRD THOSE WHO NAY COMMISSION AND WE ENDORSED WHAT WE ARE THINKING OF US FACE ONE WHICH REALLY CALLS FOR FIRST. AND AS MR FIREMAN MENTIONED INCREASING THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD. IT'S REALLY AIMS TO TACKLE SOME OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO AFFORDABILITY. AND TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WERE ALSO LOOKING VERY MUCH OF WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE NEAR TERM RELATED TO IMPROVINGI'M FINANCIALLY OUTREACH AND EARLY INFORMATION SO THAT FAMILIES AND STUDENTS. KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THEIR FINANCIALLY OPPORTUNITIES MUCH EARLIER ON AND I WILL SAY THAT AS WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS WORK IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO ASK. THAT WE CANNOT USE SOME DESIGN THINKING PRINCIPLES IN THINKING ABOUT THIS THAT WE TEND TO I THINK AT THE STATE LEVEL THINK ABOUT WELL HOW ARE WE GONNA ADMINISTER THINGS. AND WHICH ONE TO PUT THAT ON ITS HEAD A LITTLE BIT AND REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT IS A STUDENT CENTERED APPROACH. SO THINKING ABOUT FINANCIAL AID HOW WOULD HOW COULD IF WE START WITH THE STUDENT AT THE CENTER OF IT HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE HOW WE WOULD ADMINISTER. THIS ENTIRE PROGRAM AND HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. FROM THE THIRD PIECE THAT THE COMMISSION ENDORSE LAST WEEK WAS REALLY AROUND AND INNOVATION FUND WHICH WE MENTIONED WHICH IS REALLY ALLOWS US TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE TEST. HAVING CAMPUSES BE MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE IN ADDRESSING VERY SPECIFIC CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS FACE IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL AID. STAGE TO WHICH WILL ENTERTAIN AT OUR JUNE MEETING REALLY IS FOCUSED ON CONSOLIDATION AND TAKING THE CAL GRANT A BNC AND THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO WE CONSOLIDATE THOSE INTO ONE. SIMPLE STREAMLINED PROGRAM OF THE IDEA IS TO MAKE FINANCIAL AID MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE  <u><c.green>SOME OF THE</c></u> ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS BOTH AT THE LEVEL OF THE CAMPUS. AS WELL AS AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION ITSELF. THAT PROPOSAL REQUIRES A LOT MORE CONSIDERATION WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT ISSUES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION ELIGIBILITY AND AWARD AMOUNTS. AND THAT WERE ABLE TO INCORPORATE FEEDBACK FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING STUDENTS THE SEGMENTS AND OF COURSE LEGISLATORS. AND THEN WE INTEND TO ISSUE A COMPREHENSIVE CONSOLIDATION PROPOSAL. THE END OF OUR JUNE MEETING WHICH. WE HOPE THAT CAN BE ADOPTED IN. THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE OR FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. THE THIRD STAGE REALLY IS A SUBSTANTIAL OVERHAUL OF OUR FINANCIALLY SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO THE CAPITAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. WE THINK THAT THE REPORT THE PROPOSAL FROM THE CENTURY FOUNDATION COULD BE TAKEN ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR. AND BY DOING THAT WE WOULD BOTH TRIED TO DEAL WITH I'M COVERING COSTS OF TUITION AND FEES AND BEYOND THAT THINKING ABOUT. FOOD AND HOUSING NEEDS WHICH WE KNOW ARE REALLY DRIVING THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALSO WANT TO FURTHER STUDY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MODEL TO DETERMINE THE COST THAT FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY. PROPOSED. BY THE CENTURY FOUNDATION REPORT. AND WE'LL CONSIDER A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM OF PROPOSAL THEN THAT MEETS THE NEEDS. AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND CONSIDERS ALL OF THOSE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. ONCE WE'VE ADDED ALL OF THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY BE RETURNING TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH A CUP MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL FOR HOW WE WOULD LIKE TO. THINK ABOUT THE STREAMLINING OF FINANCIAL AID WITHIN THE STATE AND I'LL LEAVE IT TO PAPA EXECUTIVE DARKHAWK ALLOWED TO GET INTO MORE OF THE DETAILS. THANK YOU SIR IN TERMS OF. THEY CAN APPRECIATE THE REPORT THE EXPEDITED FASHION AS WELL. I THINK IT ALL FOR YOU OF THE VERY FIRST PROPOSAL WE TALKED ABOUT IS INCREASING THE BE ACCESS WARD. AND SO THIS IS OUR MAJOR STATEWIDE A PROGRAM THE SURPRISE A PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES IT'S CALLED THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS WORD AND IT KID. OF BE USED TO FIND AYE NON TUITION EXPENSES LIKE TEXTBOOKS EDUCATIONAL SUPPLIES HOUSING TRANSPORTATION FOOD. CURRENTLY THAT AMOUNT. IS ABOUT A THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO PER YEAR FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR WHICH INCLUDES A BASE CRAP ABOUT. A THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT PLUS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS UP BECAUSE OF THE. COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT. SO ACCORDING TO HISTORICAL SOURCES HOWEVER IT AT THAT SEE SEX AS BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ACCESS AWARD WAS SET AT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THAT WAS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. NOW THE AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO SIX THOUSAND TODAY IN AND I IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION DE INFLATION AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE COST OF. OF THAT THE VALUE OF THAT. ACCESS AWARD HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE CAR TO INFLATION. FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS RECEIVING THE ACCESS AWARD EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE AWARD IS ONE OF VERY FEW SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES THE STATE AS WE MENTIONED IS INCREDIBLY GENEROUS WITH. OF THE. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TUITION ASSISTANCE BUT WERE NOT AS. JENNER'S PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AND HOUSING AND FOOD. AND THAT'S WHY YOU'VE SEEN SO MANY REPORTS AND SO MANY STUDENTS SUFFERING LIVING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ARE OUT OF THEIR OUTSIDE OF AND ANY HOUSES AND MAYBE IN THE CARS. WARREN. ON THEIR FRIENDS COUCHES AND SO AND SO FORTH. SO WITH AN INCREASE IN THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARDED CARRIES WITH IT OF SUBSTANTIAL FISCAL IMPACT OF THE STATE SO. WE COULD PAY IT BUT IT COULD PAYS. SIGNIFICANT DIVIDENDS IN TERMS OF FOOD AND HOUSING SECURITY AND REDUCING STUDENTS RELIANCE ON DEBT WHICH WERE ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH. THE COMMISSIONING COURAGE IS THE LEGISLATURE TO PROMOTE APPROPRIATE OF FUNDING IN PHASE ONE OVER THREE YEARS A TO INCREASE THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESSIBLE OR STARTING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND WE DO HAVE SOME. FIGURES ON THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN TERMS OF IF YOU WERE TO ENTER CREASE AT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THE FIRST YEAR AND TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THE SECOND IN THREE THOUSAND OR AND OR STARTING DEPENDING ON ANY ONE OF THOSE AMOUNTS FROM THREE THOUSAND. OF TO SIX THOUSAND WE WE HAVE THOSE AMOUNTS FOR YOU AS WELL. THIS SECOND PART OF OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE READY TO SERVE TAKE ON IS. THAT WE COMPLETELY SUPPORT AND BELIEVE IN IS THE OUR REGION EARLY INFORMATION COMPONENT OF THIS SO THE REPORT. HAS RECOMMENDATIONS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT EFFORTS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO MORE OUTREACH TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE ALSO JUST HAD THIS AND AND. THIS LAST YEAR WE IMPLEMENTED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN INITIATIVE BECAUSE WE REALIZE THERE'S A A DEEP GAP BETWEEN A STUDENTS OF COLOR AND. IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ANNA IN APPLYING FOR THE FACTS OR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT AND MATRICULATING ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO INCORPORATE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION ABOUT EIGHT ESTIMATES INCLUDING FEDERAL STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT INTO SEE SEX COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC OUTREACH MATERIALS SUCH AS THE PRELIMINARY AWARD NOTIFICATION LETTERS AND THE NET PRICE CALCULATOR. THAT WILL BE PART OF A MODERNIZE WEB GRANT SYSTEM NOT THIS NOT IS NOT INFORMATION THAT WE'D BE MAKING UP THIS IS INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE DERIVED FROM. CURRENT CAL GRANT ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS NET PRICE CALCULATOR ALREADY ON THEIR WEBSITES THAT WE WOULD JUST BE PULLING INFORMATION TO PERSONAL PERSONALIZED INFORMATION PERSONS CURRENTLY. THIS THIS YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE ADDED IN ADDITION TO CALTRANS PELL GRANT INFORMATION SO WE'D REALLY LIKE TO PROVIDE STUDENTS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. A COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES THAT THEY THEY WOULD LIKE THEIR FINANCIALLY INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN COMPARE IT BEFORE THEY EVEN YOU KNOW EVEN GET ADMITTED. TO THESE UNIVERSITIES SEES ACT WILL PROPOSED. A BUDGET FUNDING FOR A PERMANENT A DEDICATED OUTREACH UNIT YOU CAN BELIEVE THIS WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED OUTREACH UNIT. A AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION SO WE HAVE OF FOLKS THAT ANSWER PHONES FOR A FROM A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN FOLKS TO DO THAT AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER SMALLER UNIT THE ANSWERS ALL THE INSTITUTIONAL. COLES AND ADMINISTERS THE EIGHT AND DOES THE TRAININGS FOR HIGH SCHOOL A COUNSELORS AND FOR COLLEGE COUNSELORS THAT AND THAT'S A BUT TEAM OF ABOUT THREE OR FORCED. THE INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED STAFF TO DO THIS AND. WE WOULD WE WOULD BE SEEKING FUNDING TO DO THAT UP SO THAT WE CAN CONCENTRATE EFFORTS ON STUDENTS OF COLOR RURAL STUDENTS FOSTER YOUTH. AND OTHER OF A DEDICATED OTHER SPECIALIZED AYE GROUPS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING SERVED AS WELL. WE WOULD ALSO PROPOSE STATUTORY LANGUAGE REQUIRING SEES ACADEMIC OUTREACH EFFORTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AS EARLY AS PART OF A POSSIBLE REGARDING THEIR ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE. FEDERAL AND STATE INSTITUTIONAL AID. PROVIDING PROVIDED RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE ATTAINED YOU KNOW WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION AND THAT WE'RE NOT CAUSING MORE OF CONFUSION OUR PROBLEM. AND THEN THE THIRD FOR A PROPOSAL THAT WERE READY TO MOVE ON IS THE IN A WEEK VERY SUPPORTIVE OF HIS THE INNOVATION IN FINANCIAL AID. RECOMMENDATION SO INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES MAY HAVE INNOVATIVE NEW IDEAS FOR ENHANCING COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IN REDUCING THEIR STUDENTS OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE BUT MAY NOT HAVE YET TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A STATE GRANT OR LITTLE INCENTIVE FUNDING TO DO SO. SO THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH AN ADMISSION INNOVATION GRANT AND MANAGED BY C. SECT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO NOT ONLY FINANCE BUT EVALUATE AND CONSIDER. THE MERITS OF A PILOT PROPOSALS AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL AND WE'RE NOT CALLING IT THE CHRISTIAN. INNOVATION GRANT BUT WE DID GET THE INNOVATIONS ARE IDEA. I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT GOT IT FROM HE'S TURNING RED BUT. IT IS A WAY TO. INCENTIVIZE AND PROVIDE ON DOLLARS FOR INNOVATIVE IDEAS ON CAMPUSES IN THE COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM THE HIGHER INSTITUTION WANTING TO REACH INTO K. TWELVE AND OTHER OUTREACH AND AND REALLY TO HELP. THROUGH THE PROVIDER OF SOFTER HAND OFF ON A COULD ALSO BE INS AND HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS THAT. WANT TO TRY A MEAL PLAN FOR ALL STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGH OF YOU KNOW LOW INCOME STUDENT POPULATION OR OF PROVIDE SOME OTHER MEANS BY WHICH STUDENTS CAN AFFORD TO HOUSING YOU KNOW AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. ALSO SOME CAMPUSES HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH EMERGENCY AID PROGRAMS FOR MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT UP FOR STUDENTS AT RISK OF DROPPING OUT OF BECOMING HOMELESS IN THIS WOULD GIVE. THEM AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO TEST THAT OUT. THE OTHER ISSUE CHU IS. SOME HAVE IMPLEMENTED SUCH AS SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS RECORDS TUNES TAKE MORE THAN TWELVE UNITS FOR INSTANCE. THEY COULD DIRECTLY INCREASE ON TIME. GRADUATION. TO ENCOURAGE DECISIONS TO DO THAT IN THIS WOULD PROVIDE THAT SEED MONEY TO TO OFFER REALLY. EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICES. SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE COMMISSION WOULD RECEIVE AN ANNUAL ALLOCATION FROM THE STATE BUDGET AND ADMINISTER GRANTS TO INSTITUTIONS BE A COMPETITIVE APPLICATION. PROCESS THAT MA WITHOUT WOULD WANT TO EXPERIENCE WITH INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO FINANCIALLY AND AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THESE DOLLARS CAMPUSES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS OR WE COULD DO THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AS WELL. OF THE OUTCOMES ON AND TO HAVE A REPORT BACK TO THE COMMISSION TO SEE WHICH WAY IT WHICH. INNOVATIVE PRACTICES REALLY YIELD THE BEST RESULTS THE COMMISSION COULD THEN REPORT OUTCOME SO LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION ON ANY VALUABLE EVIDENCE THAT. WE FIND. REGARDING ANY STATEWIDE PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE SCALED. THE COMMISSION WILL PROPOSE STATUTORY BUDGET LANGUAGE FOR CREATING A FUND FOR INNOVATION IN COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY HOUSING IS MINISTERED BY THIS TO NAY COMMISSION SO THOSE ARE THE PROGRAM THE THE THREE SORT OF MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. WE THINK THAT WE IN THE SHORT RUN CAN. BEGIN WITH AND THEN AS OUR CHAIR DISCUSSED THE SECOND FATE WOULD BE REALLY LOOKING INTO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE ACTUAL. CURRENT GRANT ADMINISTERED ST GRADE MINISTERED PROGRAMS AND THEN FUTURISTIC LEE NOT TOO FAR OFF WE WOULD REALLY NEED TO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES. ON THE ESTIMATED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION AND WHAT SORT OF RATE THE COST OF ATTENDANCE WHERE WHERE WE SHOULD ACTUALLY PLACE THAT WE DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE READY AT THIS TIME TO OFFER YOUR RECOMMENDATION ON THAT BUT WE REALLY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME ON THOSE. PROPOSALS. I THINK. I WILL WILL HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REPORT AND THAT FOLLOWED FOR YOU AND AND HOW WE COULD AT ADDRESS IT. YEARS TO COME GETS A THIS YEAR AS WELL BUT WE WANT TO GIVE THAT SEGMENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO RESPOND TO THIS. AYE WE WE WE WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE THREE SEGMENTS AS PART OF THIS GOING IT'S A STUDENT COMMISSION. DRIVEN FOCUS BETTER REALIZE THAT. THEIR SEGMENTS ARE BIG PIECE OF THIS AND. AND THAT WE WANT INTO YOUR SEGMENTS ON HOW IT WOULD IMPACT THE STUDENTS WCC S. YOU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND OF COURSE WE WOULD DO WELL TO NOTE THERE ARE. STUDENTS AT THE. AT THE. NONPROFIT PRIVATE COLLEGES AND FOR PROFIT TO DO I REPRESENT CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS BUT WE WANT TO JUST FOCUS ON THE. BUT THAT THE MAIN THREE TODAY. SO WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST. SURE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRIS CARTER AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF STUDENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND I. THINK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I WORK WITH MY CAMPUS FINANCIALLY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE YOU SEE AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. BUT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF UC'S APPROACHED UNDERGRADUATE FINANCIAL AID WHICH WE CALL THE EDUCATION FINANCING MODEL. BECAUSE THE REPORT THAT THE STUDENT A COMMISSION. FOR TWO STERN A COMMISSION THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING TODAY EFFECTIVELY SUGGESTS IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM THAT IN MANY RESPECTS IS VERY SIMILAR TO UC'S BUT I STATEWIDE BASIS SO. DESCRIBING OUR PROGRAM I HOPE THAT MAKE YOU SEIZE PERSPECTIVE ON THE REPORT CLEAR. SO THE FINANCING MODEL THAT YOU SEE IS REALLY CROWDED IN FOUR DIFFERENTPRINCIPLES FIRST REFRAIN FINANCIAL AID IN TERMS OF ASSISTING STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO COVER. A TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND NOT JUST TUITION EXPENSES THE INABILITY TO COVER COSTS ASSOCIATED HOUSING FOOD OF BOOKS CAN BE JUST AS MUCH A BARRIER. TO STUDENTS AS AN INABILITY TO COVER TUITION EXPENSES BUS JUST MUCH DUST MOST UC FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS RECEIVED GRANT ASSISTANCE BUT NOT ONLY OFFSETS TUITION COSTS BUT ALSO HELPED WITH OTHER EXPENSES. SECOND RESPONSIBILITY FOR COVERING COLLEGE COST CENTERS ON THE PARTNERSHIP NET PARTNERSHIP INCLUDES PARENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE ABLE ACCORDING TO A FEDERAL FORMULA. STUDENTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE AND THE UNIVERSITY. THIRD WE EXPECT ALL STUDENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AIR EDUCATIONAL COSTS BUT THAT CONTRIBUTION SHOULD BE A MANAGEABLE ONE. THUS THE NEED TO WORK AND BORROW IS CERTAINLY THERE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE REASONABLE AND GENERALLY SIMILAR ACROSS UC CAMPUSES. AND ACROSS STUDENT LIVING ARRANGEMENTS. FINALLY SINCE ANY SYSTEM MY PROGRAM CANNOT ADDRESS ALL LOCAL AND STUDENT SPECIFIC NEEDS. CAMPUSES NEED TO HAVE ADEQUATE FLEXIBILITY LOCALLY TO ADDRESS LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SPECIALIZED NEEDS THAT SOME STUDENTS HAVE. SO NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TURN TO THE HANDOUT THAT I THINK I SEE YOU JUST RECEIVED. AND LIKE TO START WITH FIGURE ONE OF THE HAND OUT TO SHOW THE E. FM IN PRACTICE. SO FIGURE WISELY VISUALIZATION OF HOW PARENTS STUDENTS AND FINANCIALLY WORK TOGETHER. AND ALL THIS DOES NOT CAPTURE EVERY STUDENTS CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE REPORT. THEY ARE CONSIDERING TODAY SAYS NOT ALL STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES RECEIVE A CAL GRANT. IT DOES BROAD THE REFLECT HOW YOU SEE HELPS UNDERGRADUATES FINANCING THEIR EDUCATION. SO HOW DO THE TAR REALLY REFLECTS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR AN AVERAGE STUDENT LIVING ON CAMPUS OF A STUDENT'S FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY IS CALCULATED. WITH COST UNIQUE TO THEIR CAMPUS AND LIVING SITUATION. AND MOVING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT INSTEAD OF THESE COSTS ARE MANAGED BY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WITH INCREASING PARENT INCOME LEVELS. WHILE WE LOOK. AT MORE THAN PARENT INCOME IN DETERMINING WHAT PARENTS CAN CONTRIBUTE IN THIS CASE THE INCOME USED AS A STRONG PROXY FOR FAMILY RESOURCES. SO NOT FIRST THE EXPECTATION THAT ALL STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE WITH SOME COMBINATION OF WORK AND BORROWING SHOWN IN. IN GREEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHART. WE ASSUME THAT ALL STUDENTS WHICHEVER CAMPUS WHICHEVER LIVING SITUATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF ATTENDANCE WITH A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AND MANAGEABLE LEVEL OF WORK AND BORROWING. THE CONTRIBUTION FROM PARENTS SHOWING GRAY IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CHART. IS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO A FEDERAL FORMULA AND GROWS AS FAMILY RESOURCES GROW. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IN DARK BLUE WE HAVE THE PELL GRANTS AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE BEEN IN GOLD THE CAL GRANTS WHICH OF THE SINGLE LARGEST GRANT SOURCE FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WE THEN FILL IN THE REMAINING GAPS IN THE COST OF ATTENDANCE WITH YOU SEE GRANT ASSISTANCE. IF A STUDENT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A PELL GRANT BECAUSE HERE SHE HAS EIGHTY FIVE FORTY STATUS FOR EXAMPLE AND THEREFORE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL AID. FOR LACK OF PUBLIC BECOMES A PART OF THAT GAP THAT WE FILL IN WITH YOU SEE GRANT TO RESET GENERALLY CONSISTENT LONG WORK EXPECTATION ACROSS STUDENTS. THE HIGHER THE TOTAL GRANT ASSISTANCE ACCOUNTING FOR GRANTS FROM ALL THREE SOURCES. THE LOWER THE NEED FOR ALL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT UC TO WORK AND TO BORROW. IF GRANT ASSISTANCE FALSE OR OF COSTS INCREASE IN GRANT ASSISTANCE DOES NOT KEEP PACE. THEN THE NEED TO WORK AND BORROW GOES UP. PERCENT TAKES US TO FIGURE TWO WHICH SHOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF ALL OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE CHART WERE HELD CONSTANT. AND CAL GRANT CAL GRANT FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE RECEIVED BY YOU SEE STUDENTS WAS WOULD DECLINE. THIS IS EFFECTIVELY A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE SCENARIO REFERENCED IN PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA. AND WITH LESS TOTAL GRANT ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE THE NEED TO WORK AND BORROW WOULD GO UP FOR ALL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT UC. SO PRESENTED THE SCENARIO BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE REPORT FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS ARE AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT RESPECTS. FIRST THE REPORT DOES SUGGEST DISTRIBUTING CAO GRANTS TO STUDENTS TO SET AND NEED TO WORK CAN BORROW. WORK TURNED IN AFFORDABILITY TARGET IN THE REPORT ITSELF AT ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND CORRECTLY THE REPORT REFERENCES THIS AS ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY CALCULATES IS BEING AND MANAGEABLE RANGE. BUT HOW TOUGH TO POINT OUT THAT IS STILL HIGHER THAN THE LEVEL THE UC STUDENTS CURRENT FACE CURRENTLY FACE AND THAT'S THE RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO ROUGHLY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREASE. AND THE NEED FOR YOU SEE FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS TO WORK AND BORROW ANNUALLY. AND SECONDLY WERE CONCERNED THAT WHILE THE REFORM OUTCOME OF A COMMON AFFORDABILITY TARGET ACROSS THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS A SPECIFIED IN THE REPORT. THE PATH TO THAT OUTCOME IS NOT CLEAR. AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR AGENDA FACE PROCESS FOR ACHIEVING THAT GOAL DURING WHICH THE OUTCOME IS ONLY PARTIALLY FUNDED. COULD RESULT IN YOU SEE STUDENTS RECEIVING LESS CAL GRANT SYSTEMS AND BY EXTENSION. INCREASES IN THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO WORK AND TO BORROW. NOW WE CONSIDER THESE CONCERNS IMPORTANT PRECISELY BECAUSE THE STATE SUPPORT FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS. WHO LOOK TO SOME COMBINATION OF FEDERAL STATE AND UNIVERSITY GRANT ASSISTANCE TO HELP MANAGE THE COST OF A YOU SEE EDUCATION? I BRIEFLY LIKE TO BEFORE WRAPPING UP SHARE TO ADDITIONAL CONCERNS. FIRST THE ROLE OF THE CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID PROFESSIONALS IS REALLY ONLY MINIMALLY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THIS REPORT. THE AVERAGES THAT I WORK WITH THAT A SYSTEM WIDE LEVEL ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY TO SAY NOTHING OF AVERAGES THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT A STATE LEVEL. AS CONTEMPLATED HERE WE CANNOT ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SOME STUDENTS FACE SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID STAFF AS PARTNERS GIVEN THE ONLY CAMPUS IS PUT TOGETHER A FULL FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE. AND THE CAMPUS STAFFS ARE UNIQUELY CAP THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO COUNSELING WORK WITH STUDENTS ONE ON ONE. SECOND TO ADDRESS STUDENT NEEDS THE CAMPUS IDENTIFY LOCALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CAMPUSES NEED FLEXIBILITY WITH FUNDING THAT IS CONTROLLED LOCALLY. AND SO THE ABILITY TO USE THAT INSTITUTIONAL FINDING IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING THOSE LOCAL AND SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT FOLKS ON OUR CARDS ON CAMPUSES. CAN IDENTIFY. FURTHER TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE IS ABLE TO INCREASE ITS SUPPORT FOR THE CABINETS IN THE COMING YEAR FOR EXAMPLE INCREASE IN THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD AS THE PEOPLE JUST REFERENCED. THEN STUDENTS AT UC AND INDEED EVERY OTHER SEGMENT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT. AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO KNOW THE REPORTS CALL FOR PROVIDING PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES A BETTER AND EARLIER INFORMATION ON COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. HE SEES WORK PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY IN FINANCIAL AID IT COMBINES INFORMATION ON BOTH AFFORDABILITY AND PREPARATION FOR YOU SEE ADMISSION AND EARLY OUTREACH EFFORTS. WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING AND EAGER TO WORK WITH THE STUDENT A COMMISSION AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS TRUE VOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF EARLY. ACCURATE AND HELPFUL FINANCIAL AID INFORMATION. SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS TODAY ON PROMOTING AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE TO. OKAY THANK YOU BEFORE WE GET TO THAT SEE IF YOU COULD TAKE. FALL REAL QUICK. MCCARTY. CHAVEZ. MEDINA. MURATSUCHI. VOEPEL. OKAY PHARMACIST AT WEST. THANK YOU. YES YOU. THINK FUTURE MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO MY HIGHER EDUCATION COLLEAGUES AND FELLOW PANELISTS. MANY MS NOELIA GONZALEZ AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL AID AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STANISLAUS. I ALSO CURRENTLY REPRESENT THE CSU ON C. SACKS FINANCIAL AID ADVISORY BOARD AND MANY YEARS AGO SERVED ON THE GROUND ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IT WAS MY PLEASURE TO REPRESENT THIS CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HERE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE LEGISLATURE AND THE CALIFORNIA'S TO NAY COMMISSION FOR THEIR IMPORTANT WORK IN REVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE TACKLING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WITH CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND THOROUGH COLLABORATION. AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WE SUPPORT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION REPORTS CORE PRINCIPLE. THAT FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE EASY AND CONVENIENT FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILY. AND THAT FINANCIAL AID TO BETTER SERVE STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED. INDEED THE CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS PROPOSED IN THE REPORT WOULD SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. AS WELL AS MERGING THE VARIOUS CAL GRANT PROGRAMS IN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP INTO ONE PROGRAM. REMOVING THE GPA AND EIGHT REQUIREMENTS USING ESTIMATED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION INSTEAD OF INCOME OR ASSETS HEALINGS. AND ELIMINATING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ENTITLEMENT AWARDS. THOSE AWARDED STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND COMPETITIVE WAR AWARDS. ALTHOUGH HOW OF THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE SYSTEM FAIR AND LESS DAUNTING FOR STUDENTS. SIMPLIFYING THE PROGRAMS AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS WOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL. BECAUSE OF THIS POSITIVE STUDENT IMPACT THE CSU SUPPORTIVE OF THESE PROPOSALS. WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION TO EXPAND THE COG ROUTE TO MEET STUDENT NEEDS. BOTH THROUGH FEW MORE WARDS TO STUDENTS INCLUDING TRANSFER STUDENTS AND THROUGH POTENTIALLY LARGER AWARDS. THAT SUPPORT PRESUMES THAT THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT STATE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BOTH AN EXPANSION OF THE COG ROUND PROGRAM. AS WELL AS NEW INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT IN THE CS YOU SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE THE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO STUDENTS. IN KEEPING WITH THE SLANT OF IMPACT TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF OTHER REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THE STUDENT HAS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL AID THEY'RE ABLE TO TALK TO SOMEONE ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS TO GET ANSWERS AND A RESOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEMS. REQUIRING THE STUDENTS TO INSTEAD DISCUSS ISSUES WITH THE STATE AGENCY OR ADDING AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY. WILL INEVITABLY CONFUSE AND DEFLATE STUDENTS WHO CANNOT MANAGE THE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE CANNOT GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE THE FIRST AND THEIR FAMILIES TO GO TO COLLEGE WHICH IS ONE THIRD OF THE CSU STUDENT POPULATION. AND NOT MY PARTICULAR CAMPUS STANISLAUS REPRESENTS A SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY. THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATION OF IMPOSING A STUDENT CONTRIBUTION OF ELEVEN THOUSAND. DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF THE STUDENTS TRUE ECONOMIC SITUATION. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HARM OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS STUDENTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW FAMILY INCOMES AND CHOOSE TO LIVE AT HOME TO CUT COSTS. OFTEN CSU STUDENTS WHO WORK WHILE ATTENDING COLLEGE ARE USING THEIR INCOME TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES NOT JUST PAY COLLEGE EXPENSES. YET THIS WORK EXPECTATION TO RECEIVE AID WOULD ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE THE STUDENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR CAUGHT GRANT. INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF STUDENT BORROWING. THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE A LARGE IMPACT AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IS NOT ALL ARE TAKA AND THEREFORE ARE UNABLE TO WORK. THESE EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE CS USE PRIMARY CONCERN ABOUT SEVERAL OF THE REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS MAINLY THE POTENTIAL FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD HINDER THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST FINANCIAL SUPPORT. AS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS HOW BEST TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND A DRESSER FULL FINANCIAL NEEDS IN COLLEGE. I BELIEVE SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY ON CAMPUSES IS AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH. FOR EXAMPLE THE REPORT RECOMMENDS HIRING A TEAM AT C. SACK TO RAMP UP OUTREACH TO STUDENTS EARLIER IN THEIR ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE. MAKING SURE THEY ARE AWARE OF FINANCIALLY OPPORTUNITIES. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF OUTREACH AND ARE ENGAGED IN IT BOTH AS A SYSTEM THEM AS INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES. FOR EXAMPLE AT STANISLAUS WE HAVE EARLY OUTREACH EFFORTS IN BOTH OUR FINANCIAL AID OFFICE AND OUR ADMISSIONS AND OUTREACH OFFICES. WE HOLD MANY WORKSHOPS FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS IN GRADES SIX THROUGH EIGHT SO THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF ADMISSIONS CRITERIA AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH P. CAME THE PARENT INSTITUTE FOR QUALITY EDUCATION. AS WE THINK PARENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EQUATION AND ARE OFTEN THE FIRST TO ENCOURAGE OUR CHILDREN TO ATTEND COLLEGE. PERRANCE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BELIEF WILL TRANSFER TO THEIR STUDENTS. AND THEIR CHILDREN. I AM A PERFECT WORLD ONE WERE FUNDS ARE LIMITLESS AND HIGHER EDUCATION WITH FULLY FUNDED. I WOULD SAY THAT INCREASING OUTREACH AT THE STATE LEVEL WAS A GREAT IDEA. THE MORE VOICES THE BETTER HOWEVER THE REALITY IS THAT FUNDING IS FINITE AND THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH HIGHER EDUCATION DOLLARS TO MEET ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS. AS SUCH I WOULD QUESTION WHETHER DUPLICATING THESE EFFORTS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE AND ITS STUDENTS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE CSU BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE AIMED AT SUPPORTING STUDENTS WHO FACE FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE ALL CAMPUSES OFFER FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMSAND THE NUMBER OF CSU CAMPUSES OFFER MICROGRAPHS SMALL FINANCIALLY TOWARDS. TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN AN EMERGENCY OR WHO ARE IN DIRE FINANCIAL NEED. THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM AT THE CSU THAT IS HELPING ADDRESS STUDENTS FINANCIAL SITUATION. ABOVE AND BEYOND THE COST OF TUITION. SUPPORTING PROGRAM SUCH DISEASE THAT ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY AND ARE HAVING AN IMPACT WOULD HELP STUDENTS FACING FINANCIAL NEED. HOWEVER WE WOULD URGE THAT IT ANY SUPPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS BE ABOVE AND BEYOND RATHER THAN RE PRIORITIZING. OF THE LIMITED HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGET FUNDS. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN THINKS HE'S ACT AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF FINANCIALLY AND A COLLABORATIVE MANNER. IMPROVING FINANCIAL AID SO THAT IT MEETS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AS A GOAL WE AT THE CSU SHARE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. THINK YOU. THANK YOU. COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SOME CHRISTIAN US MANY OF VICE CHANCELLOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND WE THINK THE STUDENT COMMISSION FOR LEADING THIS WORK. THE BUDGET REQUEST APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES LAST YEAR MAKES REFORMING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM ONE OF OUR SYSTEMS TOP PRIORITIES. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE IT'S LONG OVERDUE AND WE THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU MOVE THE SYSTEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. YOUR AGENDA AND THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY DOES A GOOD JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THE CHALLENGES THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE. AND I'LL REITERATE JUST A FEW POINTS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR OFFICE. AS YOU'RE AWARE THE STATE HAS A LONG STANDING POLICY TO WAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT FEES FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS USING A DEFINITION OF FINANCIAL NEED THAT IS BROADER THAN THAT USED FOR OTHER FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE PELL GRANT. TODAY ABOUT HALF OF STUDENTS HAVE THEIR FEES WAIVED IN THE PORTION IS EVEN HIGHER FOR FULL TIME STUDENTS. AB NINETEEN APPROVED LAST YEAR COULD INCREASE THESE TOTALS. HOWEVER IS YOUR AGENDA NOTES IN HIS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED FEW OF OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE CAL GRANTS FOR OTHER COSTS. AND A PREVIOUS HEARINGS I'VE MENTIONED THE VISION FOR SUCCESS ADOPTED BLASTER PRIOR BOARD WHICH CALLS THIS OUT AS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN. FOR THAT REASON WE AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE INTENT TO MOVE AWAY FROM TUITION COSTS AS THE PRIMARY BASIS FOR AWARDING STATE FINANCIAL AID. WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE EMPHASIS ON CHANGES TO THE CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY RULES AS DISCUSSED THE CURRENT RULES LIMIT ENTITLEMENT ELIGIBILITY TO STUDENTS WHO ENTER COLLEGE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. THAT'S HOW WE TRADITIONALLY THOUGHT OF COLLEGE AGE POPULATIONS BUT IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T REFLECT THE TYPICAL STUDENT AND ESPECIALLY THE TYPICAL STUDENT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS THE CHANCELLOR DESCRIBE YOUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE SERVE A MUCH BROADER GROUP OF STUDENTS AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVEN MORE TO REACH THOSE WERE STRANDED IN THE WORKFORCE. UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE MOST STUDENTS MUST COMPLETE COMPETE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF AWARDS AND THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING ONE ARE EXCEEDINGLY LOW. BECAUSE OF THAT STUDENTS IN OUR COLLEGES WOULD SIMILAR LEVELS OF FINANCIAL NEED VERY OFTEN RECEIVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FINANCIAL AID. AND TO MAKE A POINT THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IT YA AS PART OF YOUR LAST PANEL BECAUSE SO MANY STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY RISKS ARE. BECAUSE SO FEW OF OUR STUDENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVE THE CAL GRANT SIMPLY GROWING THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD WHICH PROVIDES FUNDS FOR NON TUITION COSTS OR MAKING THE CAL GRANT. ELIGIBILITY OR CAN I RECEIVED A CONDITION OF RECEIPT OF OTHER FUNDS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT ARE FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS FACE. AND SO WE WE WOULD REITERATE THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ELIGIBILITY TO. I DON'T WANT A QUALIFIER EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT THIS REPORT TAKES BECAUSE WE ARE VERY EXCITED BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION WE DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE TRADE OFFS. WHEN WE'D RICH DETERMINE HOW TO FUND THESE KINDS OF RECOMMENDATIONS. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IS AS YOU KNOW ALREADY RECEIVE A LESS PER STUDENT THAN THEIR PEERS THAT THE UC AND CSU BUT INSTITUTIONS RECEIVE LESS FOR THOSE STUDENTS THAN ARE. THEIR PEERS OF THE UC AND CSU AND EVEN LESS THAN. OR CALL EVEN LESS THAN YOU PROVIDE TO K. TWELVE ON A PER STUDENT BASIS AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF. PUTTING NEW FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE EXISTING FUNDING LEVELS WITHIN PROPOSITION IDIOT. MOVING ON WE THINK THE CONCEPT OF THE FUND FOR INNOVATION IN FINANCIAL AID IS INTERESTING AND WERE CONCERNED TO ABOUT OUR STUDENTS ABILITY TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS OFTEN FEED ON HOUSING. LATER THIS MONTH OUR OFFICE IS HOLDING A BASIC NEED SUMMIT WERE COLLEGES WILL DISCUSS IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS. WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU THERE BUT WERE ALSO HAPPY TO REPORT BACK ON A FUTURE A IN A FUTURE HEARING. AND THE CENTRIFUGATION REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR US TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN A SERIOUS WAY AND WE AGREE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION. WE AGREED TO WITH THE PUSH FOR SIMPLIFICATION IN THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO DO MORE ON OUR REGION INFORMATION. I WANT A QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT THE WORK WE DO THROUGH THE I CAN'T AFFORD COLLEGE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS A STATEWIDE FINANCIAL AWARENESS INITIATIVE THAT SPONSORED BY OUR SYSTEM. AND BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHICH WAS SHORTLY AFTER FEES INCREASED SO THROUGH THAT CAMPAIGN WE MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS OF FILM IS NOW THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE AFFORDABLE. THAT FINANCIALLY IS AVAILABLE YEAR ROUND AND I COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE FINANCIALLY EXPERTS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THEM SO TO THE EXTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN THINKING ABOUT NEW APPROACHES TO OUR REACH WE HOPE WE CAN. IT'S ABOUT DISCUSSION TO. WITH THAT THAT HAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU I KNOW THAT WAS A LOT FOR ALL OF US TO. TO TAKE IN. BUT WE WANT TO I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO GET THE FEEDBACK FROM THAT SEGMENTS ON ON THE REPORTS IT'S A JUST TO REMIND THAT THE PUBLIC IN THE COMMITTEE HERE. THE GOAL THAT WE STARTED TWO YEARS AGO WAS HOW CAN WE CHIU MATIC WE EXPAND. FINANCE LADEN CALIFORNIA TO HELP MORE STUDENTS. GRADUATE DEBT FREE TELLS A BIG COMPONENT IS THAT SO MUCH OF THE FINANCIAL AID BURDEN. SO MUCH OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON STUDENTS IS NOT JUST TUITION AGAIN IT'S IT'S OTHER COSTS AND. WE KNOW THAT IT'S OUR FINANCIAL AID STRUCTURE DOESN'T DOESN'T COVER THAT ELEMENT SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF IT. ANOTHER COMPONENT IS OUR I I THINK THERE ARE SOME PIECES THAT ARE EXISTING FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT ARE. WHETHER THEY'RE UNFAIR DISCRIMINATORY WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THEY JUST LEAVE PEOPLE OUT. THE. YOU KNOW THE ONE YEAR THRESHOLD FOR THE CAL GRANT I THINK IS SOME IT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW SO MANY OF OUR. I'VE OUR OF OUR INDIVIDUALS ARE LOOKING TO GO BACK GET THEMSELVES AND IN COLLEGE. AFTER THEIR EIGHTEEN AND IF YOU APPLY WHEN YOU'RE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS A SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY GARRETT GUARANTEE OF COURSE WAIT A COUPLE YEARS AND. YOUR ODDS ARE WHAT ONE IN. SEVENTEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHEN THE SUB LIKE THAT IF YOU APPLY FOR THE. FOR THE COMPETITIVENESS THE. THAT SEGMENT THERE WITH THE. DON'T HOLE YOU CALL IT WITH THE FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT. STOOGES ANOTHER RIGHT GPA QUALIFICATION AND THEY AND THEIR BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND BY NO MEANS WELL OFF. I KIND OF LEFT OUT SO. I'M REALLY KIND ABOUT THINKING OF THOSE THINGS TO FALL SO ONE I THINK WE STILL HAVE A GOAL IT DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID TO HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE DEBT FREE BUT THAT'S THAT. TWO BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG. AND WE WERE JUST WANNA FIND FULLY FIND. THE SEGMENTS TODAY TO MAKE SURE ARE YOU SEE CS USE SYSTEMS. CAN WORKING YOU KNOW KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND SO FORTH AND. HOPEFULLY EXPAND ACCESS LITTLE BIT BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. FACING IT AND DOING IN PIECES SO MAYBE I'LL I'LL START WITH YOU. THE PIZZA IF YOU GET. CAN TO HELP US FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD MANAGE THIS THIS THIS DIFFICULT TASK RIGHT SO WHETHER IT'S. THINGS WE CAN DO THIS YEAR SMALLER PIECES SMALLER CHUNKS. AND DEBT WHILE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT ALSO WANTED JUST A BUT A. NOT A FOLLOWUP PIECE EITHER YOU OR THEIR OR THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT TO. MAYBE GIVE US A MENU OF OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS FOR SOME OF THESE PIECES SO IT WASN'T EASILY. AVAILABLE IT CAN THE REPORT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY. JOINING. SO I'M WHAT WE PROPOSE TODAY AS THE THREE CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. YOU KNOW OF THE INNOVATION FIND WOULD BE WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE OF FELT THAT WAS. IMPORTANCE OF IN TERMS OF AN AMOUNT IF WE WANTED TO TEST SOME OF THESE THEORIES OUT AND UNIVERSITIES THE. OF INCREASING THE ACCESS AWARD OBVIOUSLY IF YOU INTEREST KRISTA TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FOR INSTANCE WOULD BE THIRTY ONE MILLION IF YOU INCREASED IT TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED IT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTY TWO I'M. SORRY IT WOULD BE. TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION TO THREE THOUSAND AND BE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION SO AND WE HAVE THAT FOR EACH OF THE STAGES RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S JUST A THREE THOUSAND BUT IF WE WERE TO GO TO SIX THOUSAND. WE HAVE THOSE COSTS AS WELL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE VALUE OF THE BE ACCESS AWARD IS A LOT OF HIS TUNES ARE GRADUATING IN TIME BECAUSE THEY FEEL THE NEED TO HAVE TO WORK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET BE ABLE TO STUDY FULL TIME. IT SO I WE DO BELIEVE THAT. WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT INCREASINGLY ACTS WORDS VERY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY ITEM CAN DEBATE WHETHER OR NOT. THE OUTREACH COMPONENT OF THEM IS ESSENTIAL BUT WE WE SERVE STUDENTS WHILE BEFORE THEY EVEN APPLY TO COLLEGE WHO WERE SERVING STUDENTS. WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEIR FAMILIES IN FACT WE HAVE A COUPLE OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT KELSO ABOUT REPOSE PROGRAM IN THE CASH BECAUSE IT YOU'RE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH AS WELL SO. YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT HOWEVER IF. IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN SIR FOR INSTANCE REMOVING THE DOUGHNUT HOLE AYE BUT WE BELIEVE IN WE CAN GET YOU THESE COST ESTIMATES OF COURSE IN THE DON'T A WHOLE MEANS. OF FOR A FAMILY COULD EXCITE ME EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS. SO FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR THAT MAKES BETWEEN ZERO AND A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF THE STUDENT HAS A TWO POINT OH GPA YOU'RE GOOD TO GO TO CAL GRANT. IF A FAMILY OF FOUR THE MIX BETWEEN ZERO AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND. OKAY. AND. MAKES THREE POINT HAS A THREE POINT EIGHT GPA THEY ALSO GET A CAL GRANT. FOR THE STUDENT. OF THE IS AT FIFTY TWO THOUSAND A FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND AS A TWO POINT NINE GPA THEY GET NOTHING. NOTHING. BECAUSE THERE'S THE THE THE TO POINT OUT THREE POINT NOW IS SORT OF THE. OF THE BASIS FOR THE INCREASING OF THE WHAT THE HOUSEHOLD COULD BANKRATE WE KNOW. THAT IT UC BERKELEY FOR INSTANCE TO ATTEND ACOSTA ATTENDANCES WHAT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. DEPENDING ON LIVING SITUATION AND SO EVEN FOR A FAMILY MAKING SEVENTY OR EIGHTY THOUSAND THEY COULDN'T AFFORD SENDING THEIR STUDENTS OF UC BERKELEY WITHOUT SOME SORT OF GRANT IT MIND YOU THEY MIGHT GET. AND SOME INSTITUTIONAL AID LOANS AND. WHAT HAVE YOU BUT IT WOULD BE EXORBITANT SO THERE'S THAT DOUGHNUT HOLE AND THAT'S WORTH AND I'M LOOKING BACK AT DAVID? FIFTY MILLION OR SO. IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTY MILLION TO CLOSE THAT DOUGHNUT HOLES WHAT WE CALL IF WE WERE TO ELIMINATE NOW WE KNOW THAT CSU AND YOU SEE. THE PRETTY COMPETITIVE BUT WHAT'S WE WE IN THE PASSPORT SAVING PURPOSES WE IMPLEMENTED AT GPA REQUIREMENT WE KNOW HOW COMPETITIVE UC AND CSU IS SHOULD WE NOT LEAVE. THAT TO THE UNIVERSITY IF THERE THE STUDENT IS OF WORTHY ENOUGH TO GO RECEIVE ADMITTANCE TO A CSU THEN WE SHOULD. PROVIDE THEM THE FINANCIALLY THEY NEED TO GO RIGHT SO THAT'S ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF COURSE. IN THE REPORT AS WELL AND THEN THE ONE YEAR OUT SITUATION SO WE ARE VERY GENEROUS IN CALIFORNIA AND IF WE. OF WE PROVIDE EVERY HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR WITH A TWO POINT OH GPA AND ABILITY TO RECEIVE FINANCIALLY THAT'S CALLED AN ENTITLEMENT BUT IF YOU WAIT A YEAR AND A DAY AFTER GRADUATION DECIDE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND MANY STUDENTS DO. YOU ARE NO LONGER ON THE ENTITLEMENT LIST THERE IS A LIST OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY AWARDS. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR ANYONE ABOVE THE ENTITLEMENT AN OLDER THAN. SORT OF AND IF THAT DIDN'T GET IN RIGHT AWAY THAT MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION UP OR COULDN'T NEEDED TO WORKER YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. SO WE REALLY DO NEED TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL. YOU KNOW. SO THOSE TWO COMPONENTS RIGHT THERE. WOULD HELP CLOSE SOME GAPS. AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PUT SOME A ESTIMATES TOGETHER FOR YOU IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT WOULD COST ANOTHER IF YOU WANTED TO ADD ANYTHING. RETIREMENT UMBEL IN TERMS OF SORT OF A MENU OF OF ITEMS. CERTAINLY THE. THAT. THAT THE CHEAPEST THING THAT YOU COULD DO THAT WOULD HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT WOULD BE SOME OF THE EARLY INFORMATION KINDS OF EFFORTS WHICH. YOU KNOW MAYBE A FEW MILLION DOLLARS IT'S NOT HERE AND NOT A HUGE HUGE INVESTMENT BUT THE KIND OF THING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IS NOT JUST SOME ADDITIONAL PEOPLE FOR OUTREACH. BUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO PROVIDING INFORMATION TO FAMILIES THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL FAMILIES TO HIGH SCHOOL FAMILIES EAT SANTO UNTIL ADULTS WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN GOING AND IN GOING TO COLLEGE YOU MAYBE. DON'T REALIZE WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE. BIT IN THE REPORT THERE'S ACTUALLY ALREADY. AUTHORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA STOOD NAY COMMISSION TO WORK WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND GET INFORMATION WITH SOME TWEAKING OF THAT. EXISTING AUTHORITY. THE CALIFORNIA STATE NAY COMMISSION COULD HAVE A WEBSITE WHERE FAMILY COULD GO ON AND SAY. PLEASE ACCESS MY NAME FOR THE INCOME INFORMATION THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAS AND PROVIDE ME WITH SOME ESTIMATES FOR MY CHILD OR ME TO GO TO COLLEGE AND THOSE ESTIMATES COULD PROVIDE COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES BASED ON THEIR ACTUAL FINANCIAL SITUATION. FOR CS YOU YOU SEE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE MAYBE A PRIVATE COLLEGE. THAT'S KIND OF INFORMATION THAT IF IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU CAN NOW LIKE GO TO A CAN TO A ANY COLLEGES WEBSITE AND GO IN AND PLUG IN A BOMB TO BUNCH OF INFORMATION AND GET THAT. AND AND AND GET AN ESTIMATE BACK BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE A TO EVEN KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO THAT OR BE. TO DO THAT ON MULTIPLE COLLEGE WEBSITES AND GET IN AND GET SOMETHING THAT IS COMPARATIVE. NOBODY DOES IT. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CALIFORNIA'S DIDN'T EIGHT COMMISSION AND. COULD NOT COULD IMPLEMENT. BASED ON DATA SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THAT OUT THERE NOW WHITE WOULD KNOW THOUGH THAT THEY THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT THAT THAT IS ALSO PART OF THE BUDGET ISN'T IS IMPORTANT ALL OF THAT. BUT THAT. THAT KIND OF A MOVE IS TOTALLY DOABLE WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT. RATHER THAN TRYING TO RATHER THAN A BIG INFORMATION CAMPAIGN OR IN ADDITION TO AN INFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YUKI IT COULD EVEN HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A CHECK BOX ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAX FORM THAT SAYS. YES PLEASE USE MY INFORMATION TO GET ME. GET ME AT COLLEGE. AFFORDABILITY. COMPARISON SOMETHING SO THAT IT IS A SYSTEMIC. KIND OF. KIND OF APPROACH IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CEASE ACTIVE THEN ALSO HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS WHEN QUESTIONS COME UP. BUT CERTAINLY THE THE KIND OF INFORMATION AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. ARE ARE THE LOWEST COST I WOULD SAY IN ON THIS MENU THAT IF THERE IS. WHAT I GUESS THE STATE CALLS ONE TIME MONEY OUT THERE IF THERE'S SOMEONE TIME MONEY? AND INNOVATION FUND IS A GOOD PLACE TO. TO PUT THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WAS MULTI YEAR BUT YOU COULD DO SOME REALLY USE FALL. TESTS OF EFFORTS WITH. WITH INNOVATION FUND. THE. S. C. SACK HAS PROVIDED YOU WITH KIND OF A RANGE OF OPTIONS ON THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD AREA SO FOR TALKING ESPECIALLY FOR TALKING IMPOSSIBLE MULTIPLE YEARS. INCREASING THE CAL GRANT. BE THERE'S A RANGE THAT COULD BE TAKEN THERE. AND THEN YOU KNOW AS IT GOES UP IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY DO A CONSOLIDATION THIS WOULD BELIKE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. OUR ESTIMATE IF THAT COULD BE DONE. THE THAT THE BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IS THAT ESPECIALLY CSU IS MADE. IS MADE WHOLE IF YOU IMPLEMENT IT AND DON'T ADEQUATELY FUNDED ALICE AS WAS INDICATED YOU COULD ACTUALLY END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE SOME PEOPLE LOSE OUT WE DON'T WANT WE WANTED THIS TO BE AN AD SITUATION. AND NOT A SUBTRACTION SO I'D AT OUR ESTIMATE WAS A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR CS YOU AND THAT SITUATION. I'M NEITHER ASTERISK THERE. ONE OF THE MOST PRISING THINGS WE FOUND WAS HOW LITTLE DATA SEE SACK HAS OTHERS HAVE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF DATA. BUT ACTUALLY SEES THAT DOESN'T KNOW. WHICH WHO ENROLLED OR DIDN'T IN WHICH I HAVE WATCHED IT WHAT INSTITUTIONS THEY GOT A CAL GRANT THEY KNOW THEY'RE GETTING A CAR GOING TO GO TO THAT PARTICULAR INSTITUTION. BUT THE ABILITY TO DO THINGS LIKE COST ESTIMATES. USING THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE TO SEE SACCHI IS IS A VERY. LIMITED. BUILDING THAT AND OVER TIME WILL BE VERY USEFUL AND SORT OF ANALYZING WHERE WE ARE GAPS ARE. GOING FORWARD AND AS YOU SAID THAT THAT IT'S. ADDRESSING DEBT IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR ISSUE. AN IMPORTANT PLACE TO START IS WITH MORE FUNDS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IN AT EITHER A CONSOLIDATED OR AT LEAST TO START A CAL GRANT BE KIND OF A PROJECT. AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER BUT THE COMMUNICABLE SPACES GOT ONLY GENERAL FUND BUT WE COULD DISCUSS THAT UNDER PROPAGANDHI EIGHT. YOU KNOW WE HAD I THINK IT MIGHT. YEARS PLAYER LAST YEAR A YEAR BEFORE THE FIRST YEAR AND HAD A DEBATE ABOUT FINANCIAL AID WERE LOOKING ABOUT TO BE WANT TO. EXPAND THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE. AWARDS OR EXPAND OR INCREASE THE AWARD AMOUNT AND SO. WE AT THINK WE ASK IF YOU PASSED YOU MAY BE IN HYPOTHETICAL BE ONLY HAD. FIFTY MILLION BUCKS WHICH I WOULD YOU CHOOSE A PRIMARY GUY I CAN DO THAT. SO IT JUST COMES DOWN TO THE SAME ISSUE AGAIN YOU KNOW. THE DOUGHNUT HOLE VERSUS THE ACCESO WORKS AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MISSED OUT ON THE DON'T HOLE ARE THEY NOT GOING TO COLLEGE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. IF THERE. DO THEY GO TO THAT SEE IS YOU AND TRY TO GET THAT SAGA AWARD TO TO PAY FOR IT OR AT THE YOU SEE. YOU IN OTHER WORDS. WHICH WANTED WHICH PIECES GIVES US THE BIGGEST. BANG FOR OUR BUCK AS FAR AS. HELPING EXPAND COLLEGE ACCESS BUT CERTAIN THE AND THEY DO WHAT I DID FIND A RECENTLY THAT IF IF A STUDENT DOESN'T RECEIVE A CAL GRANT VOTE SAAB THEY DO RECEIVE A STUDENT AT UNIVERSITY. OF STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT FROM THE. CSU SYSTEM AND I'M SURE THAT IT'S SIMILAR FOR A UC SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THAT. DOUGHNUT HOLE WHAT AND THAT THAT COVERS TO WISHIN. BUT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IS STILL AN ISSUE. RIGHT AND SO MANY OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL LOANS TO MAKE ENDS MEET RIGHT. YOU KNOW SO SO FAT STUDENT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE CAL GRANT. THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE SAGER THE UC AWARD TO PAY TO HELP PAY FOR THEIR NON TUITION AND NOW THEY DON'T GET BACK THAT JUST PAYS FOR TUITION SO YOU'RE SAYING. I THINK SO BUT THEY COULD PROBABLY ANSWER THAT BETTER THAN I. DON'T HAVE THE UNIVERSITIES AFFECTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS WE STILL TRYING TO FILL THAT GAP TO KEEP THAT WON'T WORK MANAGEABLE SO WITH THE STUDENT DOESN'T RECEIVE THE CAL GRANT. THE END UP GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF GRANT TOTAL THAT THEY WOULD GET WE WOULD JUST SHIFT SOURCES TO TRY TO KEEP THAT CONSISTENT WON'T WORK IN ALL CASES. NOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A DON'T HOLD THAT MEANS THERE'S LESS GRANT MONEY UNIVERSITY WIDE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S ALL GRANT TO SIT ALL GRANT RECIPIENTS. ARE BORROWING WORKING A LITTLE BIT MORE SO SORT AFFECTS ALL STUDENTS THE EFFECTIVELY SPREAD ACROSS THE SCREEN. AS OPPOSED TO BEING ISOLATED TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO AFFECTED DIRECTLY BY THE DOUGHNUT HOLE. SO BACK THEY QUESTIONS VIRUS IF IF WE HAD TO CHOOSE WE HAD WHICH ONE IS IS IS MORE VALUABLE. TODAY. CHAVEZ I THINK IT INCREASE IN BODY AS I IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY I MEAN I THINK AND. I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE. WE ABSOLUTE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE COST WITH TENANTS AND RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE DO THAT IS THROUGH THE BE ACCESO WAR. SONY TO REALLY CONSIDER AND THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW WHAT WITH HOW WE'RE SETTING UP STUDENTS BASICALLY YES YOU CAN GET IN AND HERE'S A LITTLE MONEY FOR TUITION BUT. GOOD LUCK WITH THE REST OF IT. AND WE'RE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT THROUGH HOUSING FOOD INSECURITY WE'RE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT THROUGH NOT GRADUATING BE HAVING TO WORK A LOT MORE SO. YOU KNOW I'M OUR CHAIRS HERE TOO SO WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT STIRRED DEBATE AMONGST OUR COMMISSIONERS OR ANYTHING BUT. YOU KNOW I THINK WE REALLY I THINK THE THE CLOSING THE DOUGHNUT HOLE IN THE GPA IS REALLY MORE OF A COMMUNICATIONS A STREAMLINING. OF AND IT DOESN'T COST A LOT A IN IT BEING ABLE TO SAY LOOK IF YOU MAKE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND MEAL BRIDGING THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IN INCLUDING. LET'S JUST SAY WE PAINT BUT MAKE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND. A HUNDRED GO BETWEEN ZERO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND YOU WILL GET A CALL GOING TOWARD SOME SNOW IN ORDER TO PAY HELP PAY FOR TUITION IT MEANS BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT RIGHT NOW. USE A WILL YOU MAKE IT IN A OR B. OR MAYBE A SEPA SI IS WORTH LESS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE CITY'S STUDENTS FOR. CHAVEZ AND OPAL THIS IS THAT WE WORRIED LESS THEN OF ME YOU KNOW A STUDENT THAT'S JUST GOING TO COMMITTEE BECAUSE TO GO FOR AN A A DEGREE FOR INSTANCE AND SO THERE'S JUST. THESE SORT OF. UNEXPLAINED SORT OF REASONS FOR WHY A STUDENT YOU KNOW CITY STUDENTS OR FOR SOME REASON GETS A THOUSAND DOLLARS VERSUS THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED. FOR THE SAME SORT OF YOU KNOW OF BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE DID A DIFFERENT AGREE THAT'S TRYING TO ATTAIN SO AND THE MIDDLE CLASS STUDENT GETS UP. A PITTANCE BUT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE AT THE HIGHER AND. AND IT'S A LAST DOLLAR AND THEY GET LIKE TOWARDS THE END SO. I YOU KNOW PART OF THE REASON THAT WE WENT INTO WANTED TO CONSOLIDATE AND STREAMLINES THE PALPITA COMMUNICATE WHAT A FAMILY COULD GET. A AND AFFORD AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE STAVING FOR RIGHT OF BUT THE SAME TIME. KEEPING TO TUITION AND FEES IS NOT HELPING. STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE SUCCESSFULLY SO. I'M IN A PUNT OVER TOWARD CHERISHES ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO ADD. YOU KNOW IT'S A REALLY HARD QUESTION AND I THINK IF I WERE. YOU KNOW IF IF THE COMMISSION WERE DISCUSSING AT MY WORD WE WERE TO PUT THAT QUESTION IN FRONT OF THEM THEY'D PROBABLY LOOK AT ME AND SAY IT'S LIKE. CHOOSING BETWEEN WHICH OF YOUR TWO CHILDREN IS YOUR FAVORITE. RIGHT ARM ANY AT THE END OF THE DAY WE BOTH WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE GUARANTEE ACCESS IN THAT WE HAVE AS MANY STUDENTS BE ABLE TO GET INTO COLLEGE AND GO TO COLLEGE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO WERE THERE. ARE ACTUALLY SUPPLIED WITH ADEQUATE RESOURCES SO THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FOOD PANTRIES AND SO THAT. THEY HAVE ACTUALLY THE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY STUDY AND MOVED THROUGH IN A TIMELY WAY. AND THERE'S SOME ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT THE BARRIERS THAT STUDENTS EXPERIENCE ONCE THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN COLLEGE. COULD BE SLOWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING THROUGH IN ITS TIMELY FASHION AND THEN THAT IS ACOSTA NOT JUST THE INSTITUTIONS NOT JUST IT BUT ALSO TO THE STATE. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT AND YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN YOU KNOW THAT THE STUDENTS WITH THE DONOR WHOLE VERSES YOU KNOW GIVING A LITTLE BIT MORE. I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH IMPORTANT PRIORITIES BOTH FOR THIS FOR THAT FOR OF THE INSTITUTIONS FOR STUDENTS FOR FAMILIES AND FOR THE STATE. JEFF JARVIS. WHY LOOK AT FOUR DID THIS DISCUSSION I THINK IT'S A? VERY GOOD. TAKEN ABACK AS WE STARTED THIS AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ARE SIX YEARS. WELL WAS FIVE YEARS AGO WE'RE LOOKING AT. DEBT FREE COLLEGE FOR STUDENTS. YOUNG WE LOOKED THE COSTA COLLEGE WELL LIKE DEAD FRAME THIS IN SOME OF THE HEARING YOU HAD EARLIER. ONE OF THE FIRST OBJECTIVES WE ESTABLISH. ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WAS TO MAKE THE COLLEGES MORE EFFECTIVE IN. TRY TO GET STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKEN SIX AND SEVEN YEARS TO GET OUT OF COLLEGE TO GET ON FOR YEARS. AND THAT WAS THE ISSUE WAS THE TRANSFER RATE FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES DESY ISSUES. THAT THE C. ISSUES OF RECOGNIZE THE CLASSES TAKEN THAT OTHERS SEE ISSUES WOULD SAY OH OUR ENGLISH CLASS BETTER YOURS SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER AGAIN. SO'S WE START LOOKING ALL EFFICIENCIES AND. AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY I THINK WE'D LIKE LAST REFORM WOULD PROBABLY CUT A YEAR OFF WHO SAID A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THE OTHER THING WE DID WAS WE RECOGNIZE THAT. MANY STUDENTS GOING TO COLLEGE WILL PREPARE FOR COLLEGE. IT IS BECAUSE LIKE CHILDREN STUDENTS HAD TO TAKE REMEDIAL CLASSES WHICH TOOK A MORE TIME AT THE. KEY MANY COLLEGES ARE SEE ISSUES BUT DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THAT IT DISCUSS MORE MONEY WHY THEY'RE THERE. AND SO DO ELSIE HAVE EL CAP. ALWAYS SEEN THEM BETTER RESULTS DENIES HAPPY TO SAY THE OTHER DAY WE HAD A HEARING. THE PRESS NEVER WRITES ABOUT THEY THINK WE CALIFORNIA FORTY NIGHTS IN THE NATION AS YOU AND I THINK LAST WEEK UP ABOUT FORTY ONE. PEOPLE'S OUR THIRTY NINE WHICH ISN'T GREAT BUT IT'S BETTER THAN FORTY NINE SO I THINK ARE WE GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND THEN WE LOOKED AT THE ISSUE ASSISTANCE FAMILIES A TRUE TALKING ABOUT NOW. I'VE READ YOUR REPORT IN FACT I JUST LOOK AT THE WEBSITE AGAIN I GUESS. YOU ADOPTED THIS THING FOR AT THESE ON ACCORDING TO YOUR CENTER FOUNDATION ARTICLE. AND I BROKE INTO THREE AREAS THE CAL GRANT INNOVATION AND. EARLIER INFORMATION. I WAS INTRIGUED. BY WHAT MISTER CHAIRMAN SAID. AND I WONDER IF YOU WILL BUT. CLARIFY FOR ME. YOU SAID THAT EVERY STUDENT. MY EVERY EVERY PERSON EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN CALIFORNIA. IS COLLEGE POTENTIAL GUY MISCARRY OR DID YOU SAY THAT ARE NOW I THINK WE NEED TO THINK OF EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AS A POTENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS SOMEONE WHO MIGHT GO TO COLLEGE. IF THEY KNEW WHAT OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND HOW THEY COULD AFFORD IT. WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ON THAT IN I THINK. NOT EVERY STE INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE ABSOLUTELY IN THERE'S LITTLE AND I THINK THAT'S FOR. WHEN TO COMMUNICATE LA JUST AS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THE GRID TECHNOLOGY OCCASION. AND WHERE PARTNER WITH BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE STARTING ACTUALLY IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES TO GO INTO. DIFFERENT CAREERS WE HAVE A LARGE NEED OF THEM SAW SELECT. AND THEN ELECTRICAL FIELD SINCE WE'RE GOING ELECTRIFY THE GRADE CALLED ME RUNOFF ELECTED CARS IN A FEW YEARS. SO WE NEED ELECTRICITY. ABSOLUTELY SO WE DON'T NEED FRENCH LITERATURE MAJORS SO WE ELECT PRESIDENTS YEAH. IF I A CAP I CAN JUST YEAH SO I AND AND. BY SAYING THAT EVERY EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT IS A POTENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS I AM NEITHER SAYING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE AND WHEN I SAY COLLEGE I ACTUALLY MEAN INCLUDING. CAREER TECHNICAL KINDS OF PROGRAMS ELECTRICITY AND WELDING AT OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS DON'T REALIZE THAT THOSE OPTIONS FOR TRAINING ARE AVAILABLE. TO THEM. AND. AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE OTHER DAY THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT THEY GO TO THAT IT NOT ABOUT TAKING MORE HISTORY CLASSES YOUR LITERATURE. LITERATURE CLASSES SO THAT THE INFORMATION THAT STUDENTS THAT PROTEST THESE POTENTIAL STUDENTS SHOULD GET. NEEDS TO INCLUDE THOSE KINDS OF OPTIONS VERY FEW HUNDRED PERCENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING I THINK. THE COMMUNICABLE GEN I'M HAPPY TO SAY A LOT OF THE TRADE UNIONS ARE PART IN WITH US. FOR THOSE APPRENTICESHIPS AND ADJOURNMENTS JOB AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL. THE. YOU MAY KNOW THE COMMENT THAT YOU SAID. OF REGARDLESS A GPA. CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE SURE SO I'M. WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF. ASK FOLKS IN K. TWELVE AND THE COLLEGES AND THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT HATE COMMISSION ABOUT A LOT OF EFFORTS TO MATCH DATA ON GPAS BECAUSE OF THE GPA REQUIREMENTS AND THE CAL GRANT AND IT SEEMED THAT ULTIMATELY. THOSE WERE NOT ALL OF THAT EFFORT WAS NOT ACTUALLY RESULTING AND ANY. IMPROVEMENT UP FOR THE. FOR THE SYSTEM OVERALL BECAUSE UC AND CSU IN ADMITTING STUDENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE LOOKING AT. AT GPAS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT GPAS AN A MORE ROBUST AND SOPHISTICATED WAY THEN YOU KNOW THEY'LL PAY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION QUESTIONS OF WHAT COURSES ARE AVAILABLE AT THE SCHOOLS AND ARE THEY TAKING A PEE AND I'D BE. AND SO IT SEEMED ULTIMATELY THAT THE GPA REQUIREMENTS. ARE CREATING MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS THEN THEY ARE WORTH. BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER SYSTEMS IN PLACE ON THE ADMISSION SIDE AND ON THE. STATUS ON THE AND AND IN TERMS OF WHETHER STUDENTS ARE. ARE BAD PROGRESSING PUTS ON A SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR EXAMPLE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO YOU WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY WHO'S. EIGHT YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WHO DECIDES TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND LIKE THEY'VE TOTALLY TURN THEIR LIFE AROUND AND SUDDENLY THERE HIGH SCHOOL GPA OF PREVENTINGTHEM FROM GETTING. FINANCIAL AID INSTEAD THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY COME THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE THAT PLACEMENT TASTES PLOT TESTS PUT THEM WHERE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. AND THE QUESTION SHOULD BE ARE THEY MAKING PROGRESS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT THOSE SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE BETTER THAN THAT SORT OF THE STRICT CUT OFF THAT WE GOT IN THE STATUTE RIGHT NOW. I'M GLAD YOU CLARIFIED THAT BECAUSE I'M TALKING MANY. YOU SEE PRESIDENT SOON SEE ISSUES THEY ARE A LOOK AT THE WHOLE STUDENT THEY'RE NOT THEIR LOOK AND ACT DAM WE SOCIALIZE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH SO. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE GPAS YOU BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOG CHART TO BE PASSED OUT HERE. THAT WAS DONE BY THE UC'S. YOU KNOW JUST RANSOM SULFUR GPA INFLUENCED SO. THIS IS SO HERE'S HERE'S WHY LEGIT TO. WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS NOW? I BELIEVE THE COW GRASS SEED TO BE LOOKED AT BUT I'M WONDERING. HOW WE TRYING TO DESIGN? THEY FUNDING SYSTEM. THAT SUPPORTS THREE DIFFERENT. EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE WONDERFUL JOB WE TALKED ABOUT TRADES AND GOING IN AND. MAYBE THEY ARE TRANSFERRING OUT TO CSU UC VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE MORE FROM OUR. BEING RETRAIN FOR SKILLS IN JOBS. THE UC'S I DON'T THINK WE GIVE ENOUGH CREDIT ON. REALLY THEIR ECONOMIC INNOVATION HUBS FOR REGIONS IN THE STATE. AND YOU LOOK AT WITH AN UC'S. IN I BRAG ABOUT ARE YOU SEE THE TOP TEN UNIVERSITIES. IN THE NATION YOU CAN LOOK AT THERE'S ALWAYS TWO OR THREE OF OUR UC'S AND. SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S GOING DOWN A SINKHOLE AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW UC'S LOOK PRETTY GOOD TO ME. AND THEN THE C. S. USE. ARE. TREMENDOUS. ECONOMIC. PDAS AND GOING. THEY'VE GOT SUCH A GREAT JOB TO DEVELOP THE ECONOMY OF NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO. SO BUT THEY THEY'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. NOT LIKE A BETTER PEOPLE IT'S DIFFERENT PEOPLE. SO THEY ALL HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE. BACK TO MY QUESTION ARE WE DEVELOPING. FUNDING SYSTEM A TRY TO. GET TOGETHER FUNNY SYSTEM THAT'S ACTUALLY WORK IN THREE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS. AND JUSTICE LA SLASH THOUGHT I THINK THIS YEAR'S YOU TOUCHED ON IT. IT WASN'T LAST WEEK THERE IN HERE ASKING FOR A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR PLUS. IN A LOT OF US SAID HEY WE'RE ALL ABOARD. WOULD TO SEE ISSUES LIKE I SAID BACK OFF THAT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION PLUS UP. TO BEEF WHAT'S THE TERM WE USE IN FULLY FUNDED SEE ISSUES. AT AT THE EXPENSE OF THIS. AND I WOULD THINK. PROBABLY NOT. AND SO IT'S ACCURATE SURPRISE WHEN I'M DOWN DUE TO MOVE AHEAD NO COVERAGE YOU'RE YOU'RE BETTER POLITICIAN THAN I AM SO THE. SO I I THINK WE. I LIKED A DISCUSSION OF THE GETS GO BUT I I'M JUST TRYING TO BRING SOME ROUTE REALITY. WE NOTICED WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH. COSTA DEBT FOR EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN WAS TOO MUCH. WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING. WE LOOKED EFFICIENCIES OF THE SCHOOLS WE LOOKED AT PREPARING A BETTER STUDENTS AND I'M VERY PROUD OF ALL AYE TEACHES AYE. KATIE TWELVE AN EARLY EDUCATION WHAT MR MCCARTY AND I'VE BEEN PUSHIN FOR YEARS WE DO A LOT OF GOOD STUFF LIKE THAT AND I'M JUST. WONDERING IF. THERE'S SOME REALITY THIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT ON ONE FUNDED SYSTEM FOR THREE DIFFERENT WORLDS. CERTIFICATE IS QUICKLY ANSWERS SO LET'S SAY YOU TAKE US TO OUTSIDE OF TRIPLETS. THAT ARE GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL AND ONE WAS TO GO TO YOU SEE ONCE ONCE YOU GO TO SEE AS SOON Y. WANTS TO GO TO COMEY BECAUSE THE ONE THE ONCE OVER THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE WANTS TO GO ON TO A CD TRACK. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ARGUE HERE IS THAT ALL THREE OF THOSE COME FROM A VERY LOW INCOME FAMILY? SO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY GO TO OCS YOU USE YOUR COMEY COLLEGE THE TUITION IS LIKELY GOING TO BE PAID. RIGHT. IN SOME WAY GOING TO BE FINANCED THEIR COST OF ATTENDANCE. MAY NOT BE FINANCE IN THE SAME WAY AT ALL THREE OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS. SAME FAMILY SAME NEED IN FACT THAT WAS CAMINO CONSTANT THAT HAS A CT. UP UNTIL THIS LAST YEAR THEY WERE GETTING FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS TO TAKE THAT CITY COURSE. IT WENT UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE WAS IT STILL LESS MACAU ACT BUT BE ACCESS WHICH IS AT SIXTEEN SAUDI SO WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE STATE THAT THEY'RE WORTH LESS. FOR GOING TO GET A CT CERTIFICATE. AND THEY HAVE THE SAME FINANCIALLY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT THAT REGARDLESS OF THE CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE WHETHER TO THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INSTITUTION. AND THE CAREER PATH WHAT YOU WANT TO GO YOU WILL STILL HAVE. A COST OF ATTENDANCE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FULFILL DEPENDING ON WHICH SEGMENT YOU CHOOSE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET. THAT'S WHAT THIS HEARINGS ABOUT. BUT YOUR ANALOGY WE'RE NOT TRAVELERS FROM ARE OFTEN THE SAME FAMILY NOT ALL THAT IS SINGLE WE DEAL WITH PEOPLE FROM. DIFFERENT COLORS DIFFERENT SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THEY COULD BE IN THAT WHILE WE ARE LOOK LOOK AROUND AND AND AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT THE JEWS AND A DIFFERENT PATHWAYS YES NOT ONE'S BETTER THAN THE OTHER. YOU KNOW JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE GUNNED IT DIFFERENTLY. IN DIFFERENT WE FUND THE PATHWAYS DIFFERENTLY AND AFFECT WE ACTUALLY WE FUND. THE REQUIREMENT. THAT'S WHAT RAIMES AND WE NEED TO LOOK OF FUNDING THE REQUIREMENT. THAT THE DID BETTER DIFFERENT JUST FUNDING THE REQUIREMENT FOR. JUST IF I'M UP FOR DISCUSSION AYE DECK AYE THREAT AYE START MY STATE LIKE SAID THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. BUT. I THINK TO MISTER CHAVEZ'S FUNDING THE SYSTEMS AND HOW MUCH YOU PUT IN THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS JUST THE FINANCIAL AID PIECE. YEAH AND THAT AS OVER LEARNING IT'S THIS WEEK THAT'S LIKE ONE OF OUR PUBLIC SPEAKERS LATER ON WITH A DAVID TALKED FOR YEARS ABOUT HOW. YOU'RE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT AT BERKELEY VERSUS A THAT SOMEONE AT UC BERKELEY VERSUS GOING TO CSU EAST BAY. IS NIGHT AND DAY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT IS WAY LESS FINANCIAL AID AND THEY'RE LIVING IN THE SAME CITY. AND SO THE TOOLS THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE TO GO TO COLLEGE. THAT. ARE ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE WHAT WHICH PART FOR TRYING TO GET OUT HERE. YEAH GRAHAM MEMBER THAT DISCUSSION I THINK SOMEBODY MADE THE COMMENT I YEAH I GOT A FRESNO GENE GREEN TO COLLEGE BERKELEY BUT. WAS A JOKE. OKAY. YOU KNOW WE HAD PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THE END THEIR PICK FOR VERY DIFFERENT TOPICS TODAY BUT JUST WANTED TO ASK IS THERE ANYBODY THAT ONE IT IS. SPEAK IN PUBLIC COMMENT SPECIFICALLY. ABOUT.

REAR EFFORTS THIS IS THAT. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO KATHLEEN A CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LOCATION NUMBER TWO THIS IS RELATED TO. YET GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR CAL GRANT AWARDS FOR. PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA JOH. KRISTIN STORES WITH THE. INDEPENDENT COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. AND AS SOON EIGHT COMMISSION. WE GET A BIG THRILL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ON. FINANCE ARTISTS ALL. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PLEASE AND MARY ARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO MAINTAIN THE MAXIMUM CAL GRANT TUITION AWARD FOR NEW STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. AT NINE THOUSAND EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT AS A CONDITION OF MAINTAINING THE HIGHER AWARD AMOUNT. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS ANNUALLY ADMIT A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE EARNED TRANSFER DEGREES FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND ARE GUARANTEED JUNIOR STANDING. SPECIFICALLY TO MAINTAIN A HIGHER AWARD AMOUNT THE PROPOSAL REQUIRES PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS AS A WHOLE TO ADMIT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER. STUDENTS IN TWENTY EIHTEEN NINETEEN THREE THOUSAND ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. AND THEREAFTER THREE THOUSAND ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS ADJUSTED FOR INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF COMMITTEE COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM THE PRIOR PRIOR YEAR TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS PROPOSAL FURTHER THE GOALS OF THE STATE'S MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION BY EMPOWERING STUDENTS TO PURSUE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER THAT ALSO ENSURES THEY ARE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU ELLIOTT. AYE JENNIFER KUHN ALEJO SO THE GOVERNOR HAS TO PROPOSALS THE FIRST ONE WAS JUST ENERGY OF SARS MONTAUK WHEN FIRST WE RECOMMEND REJECTING A PROPOSAL. OUR MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT UNDER THE PROPOSAL BOTH COLLEGES AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE TREATED ARBITRARILY SO FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FINANCIALLY NEEDY CAO GRANT RECIPIENT GOING INTO FRESNO PACIFIC UNIVERSITY FRESNO PACIFIC UNIVERSITY MAKES A GOOD FAITH EFFORT THEY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF EDTA IS. THE SYSTEM SECTOR Y. DOESN'T MEET THE ADMINISTRATION'S TARGET BOTH THE SEGMENT THEM FRESNO PACIFIC UNIVERSITY AND THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS IS A REDUCTION IN THEIR CAL GRANT AWARD. WE RECOMMEND AGAINST ANY POLICY THAT TREATS OF FOLKS US ARBITRARILY IS HOW EFFECTIVELY HOLDING FRESNO PACIFIC AND THE LONG COME STUDENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL. IF YOU WANT THE NONPROFIT SECTOR IF YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA% THAT THEY MAKE EFFORTS TO TRY TO INCREASE TRANSFER STUDENTS. OR SHOULD TRY TO SPECIFICALLY INCREASE EIGHTY TIAS I THINK YOU COULD TAKE MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH AND JUST SIGNAL THAT SURE INTERESTS. AND THEY GET INTO A I SEE YOU SEE YOU ALREADY AND THAT YOUR AGENDA IT'S DESCRIBED AS IN THE MIDST OF WORKING WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO DEVELOP AN AMMO YOU. THAT WOULD HAVE THE MAKE EFFORTS TO DO A MARKETING PLAN SOME MORE CALIFORNIANS ARE AWARE THAT THE TRANSFER PATHWAYS ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. YOU CAN ALSO GO FURTHER AND HAVE A I SEE SEE YOU REPORT BACK A YEAR FROM NOW ON HOW MANY TRANSFER STUDENTS DID THEY TAKE HOW MANY EIGHTY T. STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY DID THEY TAKE. RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION CAN'T TELL YOU THAT INFORMATION SO YOU DON'T HAVE A BASELINE SO YOU DON'T KNOW IF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IS A GOOD GOAL OR IF THE A I CC YOU SECTOR IS ALREADY ABOVE THAT GOAL. YOUR AGENDA SPECIFIES THAT I A I SEE SEE YOU TAKES ABOUT NINETY FIVE HUNDRED TRANSFER STUDENTS SIERRA COULD VERY WELL BE THAT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY DUTY. SO YOU COULD AGAIN SIGNAL YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA HAVE A I SEE SEE YOU REPORT BACK HOPE THAT YOU DO SEE INCREASES YEAR OVER YEAR FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE CONTINUE TO THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY THAT AND THE IT'S GOOD PRACTICE THAT THE STATE HAVE A POLICY FOR ESTABLISHING WHAT THE NONPROFIT CAL GRANT SHOULD BE. THE STAY IN YEARS PAST HAS HAD A POLICY NOT JUST FOR WHAT'S AT STAKE FROM GOING FROM AN EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR TO NINE THOUSAND DOLLAR WARD BUT WHAT THE WORD ITSELF SHOULD BE WHETHER TO BE NINE THOUSAND. FOR A FRAME OF REFERENCE WE JUST TOOK THE STATE'S PRIOR POLICY TRADITIONALLY THESE POLICIES HAVE TRIED TO THE VALUES STUDENT CHOICE STUDENT ACCESS AND COST NEUTRALITY THAT THE STATE WOULD PAY THE SAME AMOUNT ON BEHALF OF THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WHETHER THEY ONCE THE NONPROFIT OR PUBLIC INSTITUTION SO THE FRAME OF REFERENCE WE TOOK THE LAST POLICY THE STATE HAD IN PLACE JUST UPDATED AT. THE RATE WOULD BE SIXTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO GET THERE OVERNIGHT THAT'S SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE NINE THOUSAND DOLLAR PRE. I AM IF YOU IMPLEMENTED IT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WITH TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR INCREMENTAL AWARD INCREASES IN COSTS ABOUT EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION A YEAR IN TOTAL AFTER THE FIVE YEARS IT BEFORE THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS MARK. SO THAT'S AGAIN JUST A REFERENCE IF YOU DID WANT TO RESURRECT SOME THE OLD POLICIES THE STATE HAD FOR ESTABLISHING WHAT DOES THE WORD LEVEL SHOULD BE. WELL I'M SO SORRY SO THERE IS A WHOLE NOTHER PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVEN'T TALKED AT ALL ABOUT YEAH. FOUNTAIN I THINK I CAN COVERED AND ONCE YOU MINUTES SO THE OTHER PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT IF YOU'RE WASCO CREDITED FOR PROFIT. YOU WITH THIS YOU WILL LOSE SO YOU WOULD GO FROM NINE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS WOULD STEVE A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR REDUCTION IN THEIR CAL GRANT. THERE'S ONLY FIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED. WE ASK THE ADMINISTRATION SEVERAL TIMES WHY IT WHY DO THIS WHAT'S THE RATIONALE AND WE DIDN'T GET A PARTICULARLY GOOD ANSWER BUT WE WENT THE EXTRA STEP INSIDE IT ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT BE CONCERNS AND ONCE REDUCE THE AWARD. FROM NINE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND FOR THESE FIVE. RIGHT NOW THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM ALREADY HAS INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SO THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GRADUATE OF AT LEAST THIRTY PERCENT AND NO MORE THAN A FIFTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT STUDENT DEFAULT RATE. THEY MEET THOSE CRITERIA. SO WE WENT FURTHER AND SAID WELL HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST THE NONPROFIT SIN AGAINST YES YOU KNOW. THEIR GROUND RATES ON AVERAGE THESE FIVE INSTITUTIONS ARE LOWER THAN THE NON PROFITS HIGHER THAN CSU SYSTEM WIDE. WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT DEFAULT RATES THEIR HIGHER THAN BOTH NON PROFITS AND CSU BUT BY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ON AVERAGE. SO UNTIL FOLKS CAN HAVE LIKE MEANINGFUL INDICATORS THAT THESE FIVE INSTITUTIONS ARE LOWER QUALITY WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATION FOR REDUCING AWARD FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS ATTENDING THEM. AT I KNOW WEEK WEEK WE CLOSED UP PUBLIC COMMENT BY NO THERE'S THAT REPRESENTS FROM THE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SO. IF THEY DID WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WASN'T RIGHT NOT BUT WE WILL. AND ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. THAT CHAIRMAN IF I MAY GOD CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE I THINK THE REASON THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING PLANNING AND SAY THIS AS A PROPOSAL IS. THAT'S EXISTING WALL. SO WE HAVE A PROPOSED A CHANGE IN THAT AREA THAT IS WHAT LAW WOULD HAVE. UP FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR FOR THE WALK FOR PROFIT AYE INSTITUTIONS AND I AYE WHERE MAYBE AT A LOSS AS FAR AS WHITE IS X. EXISTING LOCKING YOU. LIGHTNESS THERE'S WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. SEARCHLIGHT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR WHICH WHICH MAKES THIS HAPPEN SO TO GIVE YOU A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE AND I BELIEVE THE TWENTY TWELVE BUDGET ACT THERE WAS A SET OF AGREEMENTS MADE IT TO LOWER. AT THE AMOUNT GIVEN TO THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE RESULT OF THE RECESSION AND THOSE DECIDED IN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE AMOUNT WOULD GO DOWN FROM NINE THOUSAND EIGHT FOUR TWO I BELIEVE EIGHT THOUSAND FIFTY SIX. AND THEN SINCE THE TWENTY FOURTEEN BUDGET ACT EVERY YEAR SINCE THEN. EACH BUDGET ACT HAS SICK PUSHED BACK THAT DECISION. EACH YEAR SUCCESSIVELY AND SO. OUR A FINANCES PERSPECTIVE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THIS IS A FULFILLMENT OF EXISTING LAW BEING CONSISTENT. YES SO THERE'S FIVE. COLLEGES THAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE GENERAL FUND. IMPACT OF ALL THIS SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RECOGNIZES APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS. A THOUSAND COCA UP UNTIL NOW ALTHOUGH THAT WAS THE ARRANGEMENT AND TWELVE THIRTEEN THAT COME FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ALL WASCO CREDITED. PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHETHER THEY BE NONPROFIT OR FOR PROFIT WOULD SEE THEIR ADOPTION THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR IS TO ACTUALLY TRIGGER AND ALLOW THE REDUCTION TO OCCUR JUST FOR THE FOR PROFITS YARDI HEARD ABOUT THE PROPOSAL FOR THE NON PROFITS TO KEEP IT AT THE NINE THOUSAND DOLLAR LEVEL. OKAY. THANK YOU TERRY MCCARTY AND KRISTEN SOURIS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALSO CHRISTENSEN WORRIES THE PRESIDENT OF A ICC YOU CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT NOT. SECTOR. TODAY MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS ATTEND A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA. MAKING US LARGER THAN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR UNDERGRADUATES ARE CALIFORNIANS. LET ME BEGIN BY SHARING WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR. HAS CHOSEN TO REPEAL THE PENDINE ELEVEN POINT OVER ELEVEN PERCENT CUT THE MAXIM KALORAMA WORK. THAT AWARD CUT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND THESE ARE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO WE ALL KNOW HOW TO OVERCOME INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES. TO MAKE IT INTO COLLEGE. SO YOU UNDERSTAND FOR OUR STUDENTS OUR FAMILIES THE AVERAGE INCOME FOR A CAL GRANT THE STUDENT. FAMILY OF FOUR. IT'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE AVERAGE INCOME FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR FOR CAL GRANT A STUDENT IS APPROXIMATELY FORTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS FOR THE STUDENTS. MANY OF WHOM ARE THEIR FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING FORWARD IN THIS PROPOSAL TO STRENGTHEN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO EXPAND ACCESS TO TRANSFER STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY RULING MORE STUDENTS AS YOU PER. THROUGH THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE OF TRANSFER PROGRAM. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AT THE CUNY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR OAKLEY AND HIS TEAM AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OUR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THIS. THIS IS A DECISION THAT THE A I CC BOARD OF DIRECTORS TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY. AND REALIZED IT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE TO BUILD TO IT. BUT SAW THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING TRANSFER TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND DESERVING JUNIOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND A MUCH MORE FORCEFUL AND TRANSPARENT WAY. OUR GOALS ARE ALIGNED. IN WHICH IS AGAIN TO MAKE THE TRANSFER PROCESS. EASIER MORE FRIENDLY AND MORE TRANSPARENT. WE BELIEVE THAT INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND OUR COMMITMENT TO STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES. AND SUCCESS MAKE US A VERY GOOD FIT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS. WE ALSO WANTED THINK THAT WAS ADDRESSED HERE. THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS OF THE A AYE FEES YOU-INSTITUTIONS. AND TO THE ELLIOTTS RESPONSE ABOUT THE FPU MAYBE BEYOND A DO IT THAT ANOTHER INSTITUTION NOT BEYOND TO APPRECIATE THAT. BUT WE WORKED OUT ON A SECTOR WIDE. GOAL. KNOWING THAT SOME INSTITUTIONS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY JOB ADT MORE QUICKLY AND OTHERS WOULD NOT AND THERE IS A TARGET NUMBER HERE. SO WE WANTED TO BRING THE COLLECTIVE TO MEET THIS CALL. SOME MOBILE TO DO IT SOONER SOME WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT LATER. I WILL MARIN MIND YOU THAT THE EIGHTY TEAM. WAS A CURRICULA. THAT WAS NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE FACULTY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE CI SHE'LL. AND THEY DID A WONDERFUL JOB WITH THAT. AND IT'S EVIDENCE BY THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE NOW TAKING ADT PATHWAY AND IT'S GROWING. SO WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE C. ISSUES SO WE ARE TRYING TO MATH TO THIS CURRICULUM IS. I'M AS MUCH AS WE CAN. THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. AND FUNDING OF ADT. BUT WE BELIEVE WE WILL SEE A STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STAY IN SERVING STUDENTS AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO SERVE FOR STUDENTS AND WE KNOW THAT OUR SECTORS PART OF THAT PARTICULARLY GIVEN THIS DISCUSSION YOU OUT EARLIER. AROUND WE DELIVERING VERY IMAGINATION OF FINANCIAL AID. IF YOU WOULD LIKE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ADDRESSED WITH THE ALLAN. ABBOTT ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE KNOW IT'S HARD WE CAN DO IT. I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS AT THE EIGHTY FIVE REPORT. ON ELEMENTS THAT WERE ALSO IN THE ANALYSIS IF YOU'D LIKE RETAIL ON. OVERALL NUMBERS A TRANSFER ONLINE EXACT TRUCK THANK YOU THANK YOU. ETCETERA. WE THOUGHT I WOULD ESTIMATE COMMISSION WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MAINTAINING THE MAXIMUM CAO GRAB FOR NONPROFIT STUDENTS. AT THE CURRENT NINE THOUSAND EIGHTY FOUR DOLLAR LEVEL WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL TO LINK THE GRANT AMOUNT THE NUMBER OF ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS ENROLLED AT THE. NONPROFIT SECTOR HOWEVER WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AND AS YOU SEE YOU ON THE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT. ULTIMATELY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS GRANT INCREASES WE ARE AWARE THAT HAVE LOST VALUE OVER THE YEARS AND. AS ONE OF OUR. SORT OF PREMIER PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA IS CHOICE FOR STUDENTS AND. LIKE THE ALEJO TALKED ABOUT THEY MEET ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND HOW THEY HAVE A PRETTY STELLAR GRADUATION REQUIREMENT FOR THEIR. LOW INCOME AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. OKAY. THANK YOU BEFORE YOU GET TO. QUESTIONS WHEN IT TO ALLOW. PUBLIC. IT ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY ON THIS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE JENNIFER TANNAHILL WITH AARON READING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF WEST COAST UNIVERSITY AND AMERICAN CAREER COLLEGE WE WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY. THE LA O. WE AGREED THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE GRANT AMOUNT FOR THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT ALSO ATTEND THESE OF THESE HANDFUL SCHOOLS WEST COAST BEING ONE OF THOSE. I AM IT'S JUST IT'S NOT A GOOD POLICY AND NOT A GOOD WAY TO GO I'M AND TO IMPACT OF STUDENT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MAP BACK APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY COMMENT I'LL SO. WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH ELIA WE TWO ARE OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT FOR THESE ARE WASCO ACCREDITED FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. AS WOULD NOTED THEIR METRICS ARE EXTREMELY SOLID BETTER THAN MANY OF THE OTHER SCHOOLS THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THEIR GRADUATION RATES ARE VERY HIGH THEIR DEFAULT RATES ARE VERY LOW. AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T KNOW. MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION THE PANEL BEFORE THIS WAS ABOUT REDUCING STUDENT DEBT. THE STUDENTS ARE STILL GOING TO GO TO THE SCHOOLS THERE THERE'S A REASON THE STUDENTS GO TO THE SCHOOLS THEY OFFER A PROGRAM THAT FITS THEM. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TAKING AWAY FUNDS FOR THEM TO GO TO THOSE SCHOOLS SO WHAT ARE THEY GONNA HAVE TO DO. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE UP MORE DEBT. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT SEEM CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMENTS THAT I HEARD WITH PANEL BEFORE. AND THE MEMBERS WHO SPOKE ABOUT THE PANEL BEFORE SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOU OPPOSING. REDUCING OUR OPPOSING THE REDUCTION OF FUNDS FOR OUR SCHOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MEMBERS GREG DOLLAR FOR THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF DESIGN MERCHANDISING. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE. REMARKS OF THE ALEJO ABOUT THE LACK OF A RATIONALE FOR THE REDUCTION THE ELEVEN PERCENT CUT IN THE AWARDS. RIGHT OFF HAND I'D SAY FIDM REPRESENTS ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE. CAL GRANT. AWARDS RECEIVING THE MAXIMUM GRANT. AND. WE ALSO HAVE A ARE DO YOU SCHOOL WITH THEIR ONE OF THE SCHOOLS WITH A VERY LOW DEFAULT RATE. OF SIX POINT GA PERCENT DATA COHORT DEFAULT RATE A SIXTY PERCENT GRADUATION RATE. WE CONTRIBUTE. MIGHTILY TO THE ECONOMY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA A WHOLE. AND NON OUR STUDENTS DESERVE THE SAME CONSIDERATION. AS ANY OTHER CAL GRANT STUDENT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU I KNOW THIS IS A WIDE ITEM RIGHT HERE WE DIDN'T REALLY DIG AS THE AGENDA BUT. IT JUST KIND OF BEGS THE QUESTION. THERE IS ESSENTIALLY IDEAL CUT FURTHER NON FOR THAT NOT FOR PROFIT. AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES BY TYING IT TO. COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERS SO WITH THESE FIVE. COLLEGES DID DID THEY HAVE A JOB BUT TRANSFER PROGRAM DUE TO HOW MANY STUDENTS POTENTIALLY. WAITER COULD EVER DO TRANSFER FROM THE COMMITTEE CALL TO THESE TO THESE INSTITUTIONS MISTER CHAIR I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF DESIGN MERCHANDISING BUT WE'RE JUST COMPLETING.

THE ANSWER IS YES BUT A STAPLE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR FOUR YEARS AND SO HATE TO SEE. A TO SEE YOU GO HUESO. I I KNOW THERE IS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR WAS SO STRONG THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE ACTION. I THINK THIS TIME OF THE YEAR DIDN'T WAIT TILL THE MAY REVISE. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK IT MADE SENSE AND YOU KNOW. THE SAME THING THIS YEAR I I AM PLEASED THAT I KNOW THERE WAS. SOME. KIND OF BANKS LAST YEAR FROM THE ASSOCIATION AS FAR AS DEALING WITH THE UC COMMITTEE CALLED TRANSFERS BUT IT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION SO. IT IT IS SOMEWHAT AWKWARD BECAUSE. IN THAT CSU FOR EXAMPLE IS TWENTY THREE IF ONE CHANCELLOR THAT THE CAT AT THE JOE WHAT TO DO SAME BUT THE UC BUT. THERE IS. YET THEY'RE ALL HE SERVED HERE A DISTANT RELATIVES IN YOUR ASSOCIATION I HAVE A FAMILY SO HOW DO YOU. HOW DO WE ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY? WELL AND THE MOM. IT THAT'S A REALLY EXCELLENT QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE A COLLECTIVE ORGANIZATION AND AS SUCH I. WE DO JUST AS A MAJOR DECISION MAKING. THROUGH OUR BOARD HOWEVER I DO NOT HAVE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE NOR CAN I. AND I TELL AN INSTITUTION WHAT TO DO SO THIS TRULY HAS BEEN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. BY INSTITUTIONS WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS MORE WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REALLY LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING TRANSFER NOW. THOSE WHO COULD LOOK AT THE CURRICULUM. AND I PROVIDE THIS ACCESS SO THIS IS LIFTING US UP TOWARD THE GOAL. I'VE IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF WORK AND IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME FLEXIBILITY RECOGNIZING AS YOU JUST SAID I CHAIR MCCARTY THAT WE. ON DON'T HAVE THAT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BUT WE BELIEVE THROUGH THE GOOD GUYS. THE INFORMATION WE HAVE. WHAT WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT FROM INSTITUTIONS AND A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WILL VALID EXECUTE THIS? I WILL SAY THIS WILL TAKE A VERY STRONG WORKING RELATIONSHIP Y. THAT AND THAT'S WHY AN MOU IS BEING NICK. HOT DISCUSSED AND WORKED ON BECAUSE THIS WILL TAKE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALSO. I SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ADT NOW AVAILABLE AT A IC CEO SO GETTING TO THIS GOAL WILL REQUIRE. THAT STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT IT AND ACCESS THAT THIS WILL BE A PARTNERSHIP. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS. I SEEING NONE THIS. ISSUE WILL HOLD OFF AS WELL. CHILDREN MAY REVISION ISSUE NUMBER THREE. CIVILITY EARLIER THIS IS A STUDENT COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL AND IN THE. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TEN PAPER FINANCE LETTER REALLY TO. FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION. TO. AUGMENTIN. AND. THAT IMPROVE THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO FUND THE FIRST YEAR OF PROJECT COSTS FOR THIS YOU NEED COMMISSIONS GRANTED EVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT. AND A RECENT APRIL FINANCE LETTER REDUCE THE AMOUNT NECESSARY FOR THESE COSTS BY ONE POINT NINE MILLION FOR A TOTAL COSTS OF FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE GRANTED EVERY SYSTEM IS THE MEANS BY WHICH SEE SACRAMENTO'S IS OVER TWO BILLION IN FINANCIAL AID FOR OF MOST OF THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. THE SYSTEM ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL USERS SUCH AS STUDENT FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS ALL THREE PUBLIC SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND HIGH SCHOOL STAFF TO PROVIDE STUDENT INFORMATION NECESSARY TO PROCESS FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS. AS THE FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS HAVE EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN RECIPIENTS AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THEIR COMPLEXITY HAS BECOME A STRAIN ON A SYSTEM THAT IS OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW FOR A NEW AND MODERN SYSTEM THAT WILL SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION OF CURRENT PROGRAMS WITHOUT THE DELAYS AND DISRUPTIONS THAT PLAGUE THE CURRENT ONE WALLS HAVE BEEN DYNAMIC ENOUGH TO SUPPORT NEW PROGRAM APARTMENTS. CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATION AND ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS. THE DECREASE COSTS AS A RESULT OF WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY STAFF TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES FOR STRUCTURING THE PROPOSED PROJECT AND THE RESULT WAS A MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH. THAT RELIED ON OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AS OPPOSED TO PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROJECTS TIMELINE AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT AS THEY BEGIN PROCURING THE PROJECT COMPONENTS FROM VENDORS. THANK YOU LA HAVE. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS AS. OF REFINED IN APRIL LETTER SO IT'S AN OLD SYSTEM ITS CLUNKY IT'S BEEN CRASH SCENE LAST YEAR ACROSS TWENTY FIVE TIMES DURING THOSE TIMES STUDENTS CAN'T SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS THE SIXTIES THAT CAN'T MAKE PAYMENTS. THEY. HAVE THE C. SACK WITH THIS IT PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE STATE'S REVIEW PROCESS SEASON OVERSIGHT PROCESS IS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST RECENT CHANGE HAS BEEN TO REDUCE ESTIMATED COSTS BY BIFURCATING THAT. THE ONLY THING WE WOULD NOTE IS THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS TO IMPLEMENT IT SO YOU'RE SEEING A REQUEST NOW FOR FIVE AND A HALF MILLION YOU'LL SIERRA COSTS NEXT YEAR FOR ABOUT FIVE MILLION AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU. STATECOMMISSION LIBBY THANK ALLY WITH US CALVINIST YOU NEED COMMISSION WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR INCLUDING THIS FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND ADDITION I WANT TO SAY THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY GRATEFUL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE. GUY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ASSISTING US THROUGH THIS PROCESS A NEW GRAD DELIVERY SYSTEM WILL NOT JUST BE MORE EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE STATE IN THE LONG RUN BUT IT WILL BE MORE USER FRIENDLY. MORE RELIABLE MORE SECURE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS NOT JUST TUNES BUT THE THOUSANDS OF HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID OFFICERS TO WHOM WE INTERACT ON A DAILY BASIS. I DO HAVE A WITH ME TODAY GREATER PAINS ARE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER. TO ANSWER ANY MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK HIM TO STOP WE WERE. AS A RESULT OF THEIR WORK WE'RE ABLE TO REDUCE THE ESTIMATE FIRST YEAR PROJECT COST BY NEARLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE QUALITY. AND OR THE RELIABILITY OF THE PROJECT ITSELF THANK YOU. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS LAST YEAR WE KNOW THE NEED SO WE REALIZE WE NEED TO. FOCUS ON FINDING IT FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WE WILL HOLD THE ISSUE OPEN EXCEL. LATER ON. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR FINALISTS TO THIS IS THE AYE COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENT SUCCESS COMPLETION GRANT THIS IS A. PRIORITY OF. THE ASSEMBLY. LAST YEAR. WELL THE SENATE. PROGRAMS AND THEY WANTED. STREAMLINED. IT SEEMS. WITH A GOOD IDEA. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS SOCIAL NEW IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR A FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM CALLED THE STUDENT SUCCESS. COMPLETION GRANT. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM CONSOLIDATES TO EXISTING PROGRAMS THE FULL TIME STUDENT SUCCESS GRANT IN THE COMPLETION GRANT. AND INCLUDES AN AUGMENTATION OF THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AID TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE FULL TIME STUDENT SUCCESS GREAT CURRENTLY PROVIDES AN AWARD FOR STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT AND TAKE TWELVE OR MORE UNITS PER SEMESTER. AND COMPLETION GRAHAM PROVIDES AN AWARD FOR STUDENTS TAKING FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS PER SEMESTER AND WHO QUALIFY FOR A FULL TIME STUDENT SUCCESS GRANT. INSTEAD OF FINDING TWO SEPARATE PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SAME SOCIO ECONOMIC COHORT AND HAVE DIFFERING REQUIREMENTS THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO CONSOLIDATE THE PROGRAMS. AND CREATE A MORE STREAMLINED AND STUDENTS FOCUSED PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROPOSAL A STUDENTS GRANT AMOUNT WOULD BE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT IS STUDENT TAKES EACH SEMESTER OR EACH YEAR. QUALIFYING STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE A GRAND IF THEY TAKE. TWELVE AND FIFTEEN UNITS PER SEMESTER. OR TWENTY FOUR AND THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR. THE LEVEL OF THE GRANT INCREASES FOR EACH ADDITIONAL UNIT THAT IS STUDENT TAKES PER SEMESTER. SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS TAKING TWELVE UNITS PER SEMESTER WOULD RECEIVE A THOUSAND PER YEAR THIRTEEN UNITS WOULD RECEIVE A THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PER YEAR. FOURTEEN UNITS WOULD RECEIVE NINETEEN HUNDRED PER YEAR AND FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS WOULD RECEIVE FOUR THOUSAND PER YEAR. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. ALEJO'S. WE RECOMMEND PROJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE LAID OUT AN ALTERNATIVE IN OUR ANALYSIS FOR YOU AND SO THE ALTERNATIVE COSTS MORE. I'LL GET AT THAT. WE THINK IT'S BETTER POLICY AND YOU COULD PHASE IT IN OVER TIME. SO FOR EXAMPLE IT COSTS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION MORE THAN WHAT WE EXISTING AS A STATE SPEND FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE STATE AID IF YOU PHASE IT IN OVER FIVE YEARS IT WOULD BE AN AUGMENTATION OF ABOUT FORTY MILLION A YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING THIS YEAR AGAIN AUGMENTATION OF. THIRTY THREE MILLION. SO I AM ALTHOUGH IT COST SUBSTANTIALLY MORE IT DOES SUBSTANTIAL STREAMLINING AND AGAIN IT MEETS. BUT BUILT OFF OF MANY OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO FOCUSES ON TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE NOT JUST TUITION. IT COVERS STUDENTS IF THEY HAVE ANY UNMET NEED IN OUR FINANCIALLY NEEDY NOT JUST THOSE WHO MEET CERTAIN AGE OUR GPA REQUIREMENTS. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS WHO WOULD GET ONE OF THE NEW DOLLAR AMOUNTS I'M BUT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO WON AND I GET ANY AWARD FOR NON TUITION COSTS. MOST OF THE FOLKS NOT STUDENTS ASSISTANCE IT'S BECAUSE OUR TO ALL THEIR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OUT OF COURT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. I AM SO WE RECOMMEND STREAMING STREAMLINED THE PROGRAM. CREATING ONE PROGRAM ONE SET OF RULES AGAIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALTHOUGH IT'S COUCHED AS CONSOLIDATION TAKES TO AWARD AMOUNTS AND CREATES FORWARD AMOUNTS JUST FOR A VERY SELECT GROUP OF STUDENTS. AND EVEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WILL WHY WOULD THE STATE WHAT'S THE PUBLIC POLICY BENEFIT OF MOVING FROM TWELVE UNITS TO THIRTEEN UNITS WHY IS NOT WORTH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. DON'T REALLY GET VERY CLEAR AND. A CLIFF SORT OF A CLEAR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE STUDENTS CALCULUS IF I TAKE THE ONE EXTRA UNIT THAT'S THREE EXTRA HOURS ON EITHER IN COSTS ARE DOING HOME WHERE. I COULD WORK THOSE THREE HOURS AND MAKE FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR. I'M SO INSTEAD OF ALL THAT WE USE JUST ONE PROGRAM ONE STREAMLINED SET OF RULES IT WOULD START WITH THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. IT WOULD BACK OUT THE STUDENT FAMILIES EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE STANDARD NATIONWIDE MEANS TASKS. AND THEN IT WOULD ASSUME EVERY STUDENT WORKS FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK YOU CAN MAKE A TIME YOU COULD MAKE IT TWENTY RESEARCH SAYS THAT IF STUDENTS WORK SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY ACTUALLY THE ACADEMIC AND. OUT OUTCOMES ARE GOOD THEY CAN EVEN IMPROVE. WE ASSUME NO STUDENT BORROWING DO NOT USE GOING FULL TIME. AND IS ONLY WORKING FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK THEY WON'T EARN ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO COVER THE FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE. SO WE. I GET AGAIN UNDER THE PROPOSAL WHETHER YOU'RE NINETEEN ONE YEAR OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE UNMET NEED OR WHETHER YOU'RE TWENTY NINE AND HAVE UNMET NEED AND YOUR LIVES INDEPENDENTLY YOU'RE LIVING AT HOME YOU HAVE DEPENDENTS. TIME YOU DON'T HAVE DEPENDENTS ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS IF THEY HAVE UNMET NEED WOULD QUALIFY FOR AID. IT WILL COST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THE STATE TODAY PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION AN AID FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENTS SO TWO HUNDRED SOME MILLION MORE SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS OVERNIGHT. YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT PRIORITIZING YOU COULD STAR AND JUST SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA DO ALL UNMET NEED FOR THOSE STUDENTS UP UNTIL FIFTY THOUSAND AND THE NEXT YEAR WILL TRY TO GET UP TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND EXCITER OF. OR YOU COULD SAY THIS YEAR WE'RE JUST GONNA COVER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR NET MIGHT NEED A NEXT I WILL TRY TO GET UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT. IF YOU USE THE LATTER APPROACH YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY SAYING YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN FIFTEEN HOURS ARE YOU GONNA HAVE TO TAKE OUT AND OUT TO MEET THE REST OF THOSE ON TUITION COSTS. REGARDLESS WE THINK IT'S BETTER POLICY IT'S EASIER FOR STUDENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO UNDERSTAND. ALTHOUGH THE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS MANY ADVANTAGES OF A STREAMLINED PROGRAM IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THREE CONCERN THERE WON'T SPEND JUST A MOMENT REACTING TO THOSE THREE CONCERNS SO ONE IS THAT. WHY I CREATE A PROGRAM FOR THE COLLEGES AS OPPOSED TO JUST REWRITE CAO GRANTS AS WE KNOW IT YOU COULD YOU COULD REWRITE THE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST TODAY FOR ALL STUDENTS? YOU COULD USE THE SAME APPROACH THAT WE'VE LAID OUT HERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE UC APPROACH. AND ALL WE'RE SUGGESTING IS ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD START WITH ONE STATEMENT AND YOU COULD DO WITH THE STATEMENT THAT HAS THE GREATEST UNMET NEED. THERE'S A CONCERN THAT MAYBE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS JUST WILL WON'T BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT. BUT I THINK IT'S LEFT ADAM STARTED TO BE SAD WHETHER THE NEW PROGRAM WITH ONE SET OF RULES IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ANYMORE COMPLICATED THAN THE FORCE THAT'S OF EXISTING RULES ON EXISTING PROGRAMS FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS HAVE TO DEAL WITH TODAY. AND THE FINAL POINT WAS SOME OF THIS MONEY RIGHT NOW IS BEING SCORED TO NINETY EIGHT AND NINE NINETY EIGHT AND I GET THAT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION A SPORT SAID NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION SCORED TEN ON. NINETY EIGHT BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST MAKE THE POLICY BASED ON THE STUDENTS YOU WANT TO SERVE AND FIGURE OUT THE ACCOUNTING YOU CAN SCORE TO THE OUTSIDER THAT SIDE BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE DRIVER OF THE PUBLIC. OKAY BEFORE WE GET TO ON. AND CA COMMISSION INCOMMUNICADO JUST BEFORE I FORGET THIS POINT HAD DO YOU FOCUS ON. SCORING IT. IT WILL BE WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THAT. COMMITTEE COLLEGE PROP NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. TO DO THIS AND WHAT ALL THE SITE ON HOW YOU WANTED TO DO IT YOU COULD FIND OUT FROM ANY SOURCE RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT CAL GRANT MONEY THAT'S NON NINETY EIGHT THAT WE WOULD PULL INTO FUND THE STREAMLINED PROGRAM AND PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY. THAT YOU WOULD PULL THEM OUT IS THAT THE NEW NINETY EIGHT MONEY. WHERE WOULD YOU GET IT FROM? YES THIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE SUGGEST YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO DO IT OVERNIGHT IT OR YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES YOU WILL BE TAKING UP FROM SOME OTHER PROP NINETY EIGHT PRIORITY. OR SOME OTHER STATE PRIORITY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE STAKES OF IF YOU WANTED TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD YOU HAVE TO FIND THE MONEY IT COMES FROM SOMEWHERE. IS GOING TO COME FROM SOMETHING ELSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO. YEAH THAT ONLINE IDEA. AND. OKAY. NEVER MIGHT. MANY COLLEGES RIGHT CRISSCROSS WHENEVER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO STREAMLINE THAT THE NEWLY CREATED PROGRAMS AS DISCUSSED EARLIER MAKING FINANCIALLY IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE FUNDS WOULD HAVE THEIR INTENDED IMPACT WHICH IS ENCOURAGING BEHAVIOR THAT LEADS TO. CULTURAL POLLUTION. I DID WANT TO LINK IT TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION SOME OF THESE TO PROGRAMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STUDENTS WHO CURRENTLY RECEIVE THE CALGARY HAPPY SO FOR CONTEXT. WE HAVE ABOUT A MILLION STUDENTS RECEIVE THE COLLEGE PROMISED GRANTS BUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND THOSE ONE IN TEN RECEIVED A TELEGRAM PIECE SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF A SUBSET OF STUDENTS. THAT SAID ALL AT OUR CONCURRENCE THAT WHEN STUDENTS ARE ON A GUIDED PATHWAYS AND WHEN THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS AKE SENSE AND IT SUPPORTS THE GOALS WE'VE INCLUDED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. WE I'M GONNA GET IN THE WEEDS WE WANTED OUT JUST A FEW TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP AS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THESE TWO PROGRAMS THE PAST FEW YEARS. IN AS WE'VE DISCUSSED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WITH OUR COLLEGES. FIRST THE COMPLETION GRANT REQUIRES THAT STUDENTS. HAVE COMPLETED AN EDUCATION PLAN AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THE FUNDS. AND AND I WOULD SAY THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK EXPECTS THAT STUDENTS HAVE AN EDUCATIONAL GOAL UP FRONT THAT THERE PUTTING THEM ON PATHWAYS. TO MEET THOSE GOALS FOR COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE PLANTS THAT REFLECT THOSE SCHOOLS. WITHOUT SAID AS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE COMPLETION GRANT WE FOUND THAT IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR THE PLANTS TO REACH THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICES TO ALLOW FOR STUDENTS TO BE PAID. OTHER FINANCIAL AID IN A TIMELY WAY AND WERE WELL WE'RE WORKING TO IMPROVE COORDINATION AND THAT'S A KEY PART OF GUIDED PATHWAYS TO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS WHO CAN GET THEIR FINANCIAL AID EARLY. AND A WHAT MAKES THE MOST DIFFERENCE SO I THINK WE WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. SECOND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SPECIFIES DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FUNDING BASED ON THE NUMBER OF UNITS OUR EXISTING SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS SET UP TO WARD FINANCIAL AID BASED ON SOME THRESHOLDS THREE SIX NINE. TWELVE FIFTEEN UNITS AND SO SETTING UP SYSTEMS THAT ARE JUST FINANCIAL AID PER UNIT. IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE READ HAVE BOTH ONE TIME WORKLOAD TO PROGRAM SYSTEMS AND SOME ONGOING PROCESS IS THAT WE NEED TEMPLATE TO MONITOR UNIT BY UNIT CHANGES AND STUDENTS COURSE TAKING BEHAVIOR. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT. WE THINK STILL ARE IT MAKES SENSE THAT STUDENTS THAT IF THEY CAN ON PATHWAYS TO TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS TO TRANSFERRING COMPLETE IN A TIMELY WAY. WE THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE UNITS SPECIFIC INCENTIVES. WITH ADMINISTERING THE COSTS IN A IN AN EFFICIENT WAY. WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. WE'LL BE BACK ALLOW BEHALF OF THE CONFERENCE TO NAY COMMISSION AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE COMMISSION IS GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE AND SIMPLIFY FINANCIALLY WHEREVER POSSIBLE WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE INVESTING IN ITS ADDITIONAL GRANT AID. FOR COMEY COLLEGE STUDENTS WE RECOGNIZE THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN RECEIVE THE LEAST SUPPORT FOR NON TUITION COSTS SUCH BOOKS SUPPLIES AND LIVING COSTS. WE SUPPORT ANY EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE ON TIME GRADUATION TRANSFER THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT THE EXPECTATIONS REPLACE INSTANCE IS OFTEN NOT MATCHED BY THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS AVAILABLE TO THEM. INCENTIVIZING ON TIME GRADUATION THROUGH INCREASED AID AS WELL AS COUNSELLING ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. AS ONE IT TAKE US BACK TO THE VERY FIRST CONVERSATION WE HAD AND. TO TRULY CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL ALONG WITH THE OVERALL GENERAL PROPOSAL ABOUT CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL AID FOR ALL STUDENTS AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND. I'M REALLY CONSIDERING YOU KNOW MANY OF THE EFFORTS THAT EVEN ARE HERE TODAY ARTS WERE PIECE BILLION BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER FUNDING US SEGMENT OF STUDENTS THAT SEVERELY NEED IT SO. A WHAT CAN WE DO TO ENSURE THAT. THERE'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR ALL FIVE SEGMENTS AND YOU REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER WHO. YOU KNOW WHO ADMINISTERS IT AND. AND AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY BEHIND IT WHICH OBVIOUSLY. YOU'RE TAKING ALL THIS INTO CONSIDERATION AT THIS HEARING. OKAY. QUESTIONS FROM. TO MANY MEMBERS. THE KIND OF STARTED OUT ON THIS EARLIER AT. IT IS. IN THIS ITEM BUT ALSO ON THE FOR SIDE OF SELF. WE'LL EVALUATE THESE TO PROPOSAL SAY WE HAVE WITH THE WITH THE MARY VISION AND LOOK AT WAYS TO. ESSENTIALLY EXPAND FINANCIAL AID IN A FEW WEEKS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THINKING. THAT WE WILL ADJOURN
