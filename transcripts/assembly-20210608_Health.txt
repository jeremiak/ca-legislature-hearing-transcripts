SO FEELS LIKE I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A VERY LONG TIME IT REALLY- REALLY- HAPPY TO BE HERE BUT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME 2% SB THREE ELEVEN THE COMPASSIONATE ACCESS. TO MEDICAL ACCESS ACTOR RYAN'S LAW. WE WANTED A NAME THIS BILL AFTER RYAN BARTEL LOOK CALIFORNIA NATIVE. AND A US COAST GUARD VETERAN WHO TRAGICALLY PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AFTER A BRAVE BATTLE PANCREATIC CANCER. HE'S BEEN HIS FINAL WEEKS IN A HOSPITAL WHERE WE HE WAS GIVEN MORPHINE. AND FENTANYL FOR HIS EXTREME PAIN. BUT HE'S MAINLY SPENT HIS FINAL FINAL DAYS OF SLEEP. WHEN HIS FAMILY TRIED TO- VISIT HIM HE'D BE ASLEEP MOST OF THE TIME A REALLY- ON CONSCIENCE HIS FAMILY TRY TO INTRODUCED MEDICAL CANNABIS WAS TREATMENT PLAN SO HE COULD STAY AWAKE AND VISIT WITH HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THIS RICK REMAINING DAYS THEY WERE TOLD. IT WAS NOT ALLOWED. THEY FINALLY FOUND A PLACE THAT WOULD. ALLOW THE- WHO WOULD THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GIVE HIM MEDICAL CAN'T CANNABIS SADLY HE ONLY HE ONLY LIVED A FEW MORE WEEKS BUT IN HIS FINAL WEEK SHE WAS ABLE TO HAVE A QUALITY OF LIFE IN HIS ROOM REMAINING DAYS. THAT HE DID NOT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST HOSPITAL THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT NO PATIENT OR FAMILY MUST GO THROUGH THAT HEARTBREAK AGAIN. RYAN'S LAW WOULD REQUIRE THAT HOSPITALS IN CERTAIN TIMES OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN STATE. LAW TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR THE TREATMENT. AND FOR PAIN RELIEF- YOU RECALL WE APPROVE THIS BILL UNANIMOUSLY IN BOTH HOUSES IN TWENTY NINETEEN. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR DUE TO THE FEAR THAT THE FACILITIES MIGHT LOSE FEDERAL CMS FUNDING. IF THEY WERE TO COMPLY. SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD A BREAK THROUGH. AND A FEW MONTHS AGO WE RECEIVE CONFIRMATION IN WRITING FROM CMS. THAT THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID REGULATIONS DO NOT ADDRESS THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. AND CMS STATES. THAT IT IS NOT AWARE OF A PROVIDER THAT HAS SPECIFICALLY LOS FUNDING OR BEEN PENALIZED FOR PERMITTING. THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND IN OTHER UP OF MEDICAL FACILITIES THIS IS BEEN ALLOWED AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY SINGLE PROBLEMS FURTHERMORE THE CMS THEY SAID IT WOULD NOT SITE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. FOR ALLOWING MEDICAL CANNABIS USE UNLESS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS MADE AN ADVERSE FINDING. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS PROHIBITED TO USE ANY FEDERAL FUNDS TO INTERFERE WITH STATE MEDICAL CANNABIS LAWS. AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IT EVERY INDICATION THAT IT WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH STATE CANNABIS LAWS MEDICAL OR RECREATIONAL. THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THE RISK FOR FEDERAL INNOVATION AS LITTLE TO NONE. WITH THIS CONFIRMATION FROM CMS IN THE SIEVE SAFEGUARDS IN THIS BILL WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES HAVE THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL SERVICES SEE ASIAN. AND STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WILL BE MEETING SOON WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DPH IS REEVALUATING ITS TWENTY NINETEEN STANDS GIVEN THIS UPDATE NCHA HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL SUPPORT THE BILL IF DPH DETERMINES THEY DO NOT NEED TO SITE PROVIDERS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS BILL.

INCLUDED THE WHITE PAPER ON CANNABIS WHICH CALLED FOR THE ACTIONS YOU SAW PROP SIXTY FOUR. THIS BILL IS AN ATTRACTIVE. PRESS TRUST OF PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY SET UP NEW INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AND STRUCTURE TO ALLOW THE KINDS OF CONTROLS WE NEED FOR BOTH PUBLIC BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS. HOWEVER YOU CAN'T SET UP AN INTERNAL INDUSTRY AND JUST SIXTY SIX SIXTY TWO PAGES WHICH IS WHAT THE- OPPOSITION WAS. YOU CAN ONLY PROVIDE THE STRUCTURE AND FRAMEWORK UPON WHICH THE STATE CONTROL AGENCIES AND THIS LEGISLATURE LET YOU. BUILD POLICIES TO ALLOW OUR PEOPLE TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF CANNABIS WHILE LIMITING ITS ABUSES. THIS ACTMANDATES PERMISSIVE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR SOME PATIENCE AND SOME HEALTHCARE FACILITIES TO ENJOY THOSE BENEFITS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE POLICIES AND EXPRESSED IN THE STATUTE. NOW SINCE THE LAST TIME I TESTIFIED TWO YEARS AGO ON THE PREVIOUS THOUGH- WE HAVE MADE SOME VERY NICE FINDINGS WITH CMS CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. AND I WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THE SERVER IS JUST BRIEFED YOU ON WHAT THOSE ARE. THIS BILL WILL BE HELPFUL IF YOU WANT. BY THIS BY.

FOR YOU TO HELP US ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING BY TREATING TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS AT THE RATE HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER BUT THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. YES AS A PHYSICIAN AND SCIENTIST I BELIEVE WE ARE TO FOLLOW WITH THE- MEDICAL RESEARCH JOBS AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE- PUBLISHED A REPORT DAY REVIEW OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDIES INVOLVING CANNABIS IN THEY FOUND THERE'S CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT CANNABIS IS EFFECTIVE. IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN NAUSEA PARTICULARLY DUE TO- TO- CHEMOTHERAPY WHICH CANCER PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING AND ALSO MUSCLE SPASM MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN NAUSEA DUE TO THEIR CARE WITH THERAPY.

CJ IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS OR EVEN NECESSARILY THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AND HOSPITALS. HOWEVER IT IS NOTED AND HIS VETO MESSAGE OF A NEARLY IDENTICAL BILL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM WROTE THAT HEALTH FACILITIES MUST COMPLY WITH ALL FEDERAL LAWS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THEIR SERVICES. AND THAT IT WOULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT CONFLICTS BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW CANNOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY- OF GREATER CONCERN IN ITS LETTER OF OPPOSITION TO THE SAME BILL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STATED THAT THEY MUST SITE HOSPITALS FOR ALLOWING THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. FOR THAT REASON WE DO REMAIN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION- FOR THE BILL TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

I'M HERE RESEARCHER GREAT THANK YOU- SO WE DID HEAR FROM THE SENATOR- THAT THEY HAVE SOME FEEDBACK FROM- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT IS IT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR- IT. IN A IT N. CONTINUING WITH OPPOSITION OR WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. SO THE MAIN POINT OF OUR CONCERN IS THAT- FOR THE PREVIOUS BILL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHICH REGULATES HOSPITALS AND LICENSES LICENSES US- AND NOT ONLY ENFORCES LAWS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO DOES LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- IN YOUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CITE HOSPITALS. SO WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS- AN INDICATION- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AND REVISITING OF THEIR POSITION. THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO CITE HOSPITALS FOR COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW. SO THE SITE HOSPITALS BASED ON STATE LAW IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OUR OUR DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH ACTUALLY OVERSEAS. CANNABIS AS WELL REGULATORY AGENCIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CITE HOSPITALS. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. REQUIRED ISN'T HOSPITALS ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WAS ACCORDING TO THEIR LETTER- AND WE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY INTENTION OF DOING THAT SO I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR- DO YOU WANT TO. HELP HELP ME UNDERSTAND. WE LIKE TO HAVE A FORMAL WE DID SEE THE EMAIL FROM CMS- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE IS A OF A FORMAL STATEMENT THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AGREES THAT THEY WANT THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SIDE.

THEY IF THE BILL PASSES SO WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING A LETTER OF A PROVIDED I THINK THEY'LL BE VERY HELPFUL SO THAT'LL BE OUR OUR NEXT COURSE OF ACTION BUT IT TO ME- IF EVEN THE US IT IS INCONCEIVABLE TO ME GIVEN THE SAFEGUARDS IN THE BILL THE EXIT STRATEGY IN CASE. WE RECEIVE ANY KIND OF NOTICE THE BILL HAS A SAFE HARBOR THAT ALLOWS US TO SUSPEND THE LAW SO- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO WORK INTO THE BILL TO MAKE IT- SATISFACTORY TO EVERYBODY INVOLVED BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO- BRING THAT INFORMATION FOR BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL BE VERY HELPFUL TO THE BILL.
