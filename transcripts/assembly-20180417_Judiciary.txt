THIRTY TO TWELVE MISSOURI. MORNING. MORNING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB THIRTY TO TWELVE UPDATES EXPANDS THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY AND VETERANS CODE TO INCREASE. MILITARY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ORDER TO MORE EFFICIENTLY SAFEGUARD OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES MISTER IS THAT. THEY GIVE THE CLOSER TO MY PHONE DOESN'T HAVE THAT IT'S HARD FOR YOU. HELLO THERE WE GO OUTSIDE. I WILL NOT START OVER. UNDER CURRENT LAW MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS IN CODE QUICKLY EXPIRE AFTER SERVICE MEMBER LEAVES ACTIVE DUTY AB THIRTY TO TWELVE WILL HELP THOSE WHO STRUGGLE TO RE INTEGRATE. AFTER RETURNING FROM DEPLOYMENT BY EXTENDING THE TIME FRAME THAT SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE PROTECTION AGAINST EVICTION AND NON. A JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE FOR UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS AFTER LEAVING ACTIVE DUTY. THE BILL ALSO ADDS THAT OUR STATE'S FULL TIME ACTIVE COMPONENT PERSONNEL RECEIVE EQUIVALENT PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL SERVICE MEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF ACT. WE MUST DO OUR PART AS STATE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS TO BETTER PROTECT THESE MEN AND WOMEN AFTER AND IN BETWEEN. PERIODS OF SERVICE. I HAVE WITH ME. TWO WITNESSES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHARLES HARVEY A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE UP WITH THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. I HAVE IF ETCETERA SPONSORED A AB THIRTY TO TWELVE. ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE LIKE I THINK THE MEMBER IRWIN FOR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA FOR AUTHORING IS IMPORTANT BILL. AB THIRTY TO TWELVE IS A SENSIBLE CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE SIX EASE THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL BURDENS PLACED ON CALIFORNIA SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES BROUGHT ON BY THE DEMANDS OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE. THE BILL ALSO AIMS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A LOT LEAST AS PROTECTIVE FOR SERVICE MEMBERS THAT THE CORRESPONDING FEDERAL LAW. I THE STANDS TODAY MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED. TO OUR SERVICE MEMBERS UNDER STATE LAW EXPIRE QUICKLY AFTER SERVICE MEMBER LEAVE ACTIVE DUTY. OUR THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE SERVICE MEMBERS NEED TIME AFTER DEPLOYMENT TO REINTEGRATE AND MAY FACE FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING THIS PERIOD OF TRANSITION. AB THERE DOES TWELVE WOULD EXTEND THE LENGTH OF TIME SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE VARIOUS PROTECTIONS ALGUNOS GETS THE BALL JUDGMENT ON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE. TOOK TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS AFTER LEAVING ACTIVE DUTY. THE BILL ALSO INCORPORATES IN THE STATE LAW SOME PROTECTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ONLY FOUND IN FEDERAL AT SEE. INCLUDING RIGHT TO TERMINATE A MOTOR VEHICLE LEASES EXPANDED PROTECTIONS AGAINST LEAN SALES AND MAKING CLEAR THAT INTEREST ABOVE SIX PERCENT CAP ON PRE SERVICE OBLIGATIONS FORGIVEN AND NOT MERELY DEFERRED. AND LASTLY OUR STATE LAWS CURRENT MILITARY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS APPLY ONLY TO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE COMPONENTS. SO THEY DO NOT EXTEND TO THE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A FULL TIME MEMBERS OF THE ACTIVE COMPONENT OF THE ARMED FORCES LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I BE THERE TO SEE TWELVE ADDRESSES ITS MISSION BY MAKING THE STATE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES INCLUDING ACTIVE COMPONENT PERSONNEL. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE BILL WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD BETTER PROTECTING CALIFORNIA SERVICE MEMBERS INCLUDING DURING BOTH CRITICAL POST DEPLOYMENT AND POST SEPARATION PERIODS. I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE NICK ACRE IS A MEMBER OF THE STATE MILITARY RESERVE AND THE SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO OVERSEES THE DOJ'S CONSUMER LAW SECTION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

ON INDIVIDUAL LEGAL CONCERNS AT THE FACE DURING DEPLOYMENT. OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS OUR CONSUMER LAW SECTION HAS UNDERTAKEN A TARGETED EFFORT TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MILITARY AND VETERAN COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S INCLUDE OUT INCLUDE OUTREACH TRAINING FOR JACK LEGAL ASSISTANCE ATTORNEYS AND FINANCIAL COUNSELORS. AND TARGETED LAWSUITS AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS UNDER OUR MILITARY AND VETERANS CODE AND OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. UNDER NUMBER OF THIS CASE IS A DIRECT RESULT OF REFERRALS FROM OUR PARTNERS IN THE MILITARY AND VETERANS COMMUNITY. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I AB THIRTY TO TWELVE IS A PRODUCT OF THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE OF THE INSIGHTS AND FEEDBACK WE RECEIVE FROM OUR PARTNERS IN THE JAG LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND MILITARY FINANCIAL COUNSELOR COMMUNITIES. INFIRMITY JEWEL SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS WHO CONTACTED OUR OFFICE. AS MISTER HERBIE INDICATED AB% THIRTY TO TWELVE WOULD WOULD IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S MILITARY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN TWO WAYS FIRST IT WOULD MAKE OUR EXISTING LOT MORE EFFECTIVE BY FILLING GAPS. AND ENSURING THEIR LAW REMAINS AS EFFECTIVE AS THE FEDERAL SERVICE MEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF ACT. AND IT WOULD ALSO EXTEND THE DURATION OF THIS PERIOD OF THE DURATION OF THOSE PROTECTIONS INCLUDING THE PROTECTIONS AGAINST FORECLOSURE AFFECTIONATE REPOSSESSION. TO HELP SERVICE MEMBERS WHEN THEY TRANSACT TRANSITION BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE. IN ADDITION IT WOULD EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CURRENT STATUTE WHICH CURRENTLY ONLY COVER MEMBERS OF THE GUARD AND RESERVE. TO COVER MEMBERS OF THE ACTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE ARMED FORCES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS. ASSOCIATION. MEMBERS SP SEVENTY FIVE I MAKES A PROCEDURAL A CHANGE OF THE EVIDENCE CODE OUGHT TO PREVENT. IRRELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS UP FROM BEING RAISED AYE IN OPEN COURT. AYE THIS PROCEDURAL CHANGE OUR DOES NOT AYE. EXCLUDE EVIDENCE IS NOT CHANGING WHAT'S ADMISSIBLE OR WHAT'S AND ADMISSIBLE. ABBOTT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT IF AN ATTORNEY WHETHER IN A CIVIL CASE OR CRIMINAL CASE WHICH IS TO QUESTION A WITNESS ABOUT HIS OR HER. IMMIGRATION STATUS ODD BAIT AGUILLAR FIRST HAVE TO GO IN CAMERA. WITH THE JUDGE MAKE A PROPER ABOUT WHY IT'S RELEVANT THE JUDGE WILL MAKE A RULING AND THAT IT WILL EITHER BE ALLOWED. OR NOT ALLOWED. THIS WILL. OF BUOYED. THAT SITUATION THAT WE ARE SEEING. IT NOT JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT AND OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL. WHERE? IMMIGRANTS COME TESTIFYING COR FATHER ASKED ABOUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. SOMETIMES IN VERY IRRELEVANT SITUATIONS. I AND IT IS AYE INTIMIDATING. I AND. WE KNOW THAT I USE IS NOT IN OUR COURTHOUSES. I AND THE LAST THING WE NEED IS A MATTER PUBLIC SAFETY IS FOR IMMIGRANTS TO BELIEVE THAT IF THEY GO TO COURT TO TESTIFY. WHETHER THE VICTIM WHETHER THE WITNESS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET DEPORTED WE WE WE GOT WILL UNDERMINE. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY I'D THIS I KNEW PROCEDURAL RULE ARE IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE ROLE IT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. IN. RAPE PROSECUTIONS I WHEN. THE VICTIM OF A RAPIST TESTIFYING I CAN'T JUST ASK THAT WITNESS THAT VICTIM ABOUT HIS OR HER SEXUAL HISTORY YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT YOU HAVE TO GO IN CAMERA. WITH THE COURT FIRST AND MAKE A PROFFER FOR WHY IT'S RELEVANT TO THIS IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED. AND IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE I IN THE WORLD HERE. ARE WE HAVE GOT AND. GROWING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I WITH ME HERE TODAY IS NOT SABOT ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSOR THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THANK YOU AND SENATOR THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT ARE FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT'S ADDRESSED IN THE. ANALYSIS AND AND I THINK OF YOUR TAKING OF THAT WE ACCEPT THAT YES AND ALSO WITH ME TODAY IS CHRYSANTHOS. FROM THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. FIRST WITH FLEAS I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MAX SZABO AND I'M FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO PETRONIUS OFFICE. AND WE WANNA THANK GOD SENATOR WINNER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING DEPRESSED REPORTING AMONG IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE AS WELL. AROUND AND WHEN ANYBODY DOES NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD IN REPORTING A CRIME LET ALONE TAKING THE NEXT STEP IN TAKING THE WITNESS STAND. ON THAT IMPACTS THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE FEEL SAFE COMING TO THE COURT TOWARD CUP TORE COURTS. I MEAN THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A COURT ROOMS. AND WHAT THIS BILL BASICALLY DOES IS JUST AVOID. BE UNNECESSARY COURTROOM DRAMA WHERE SOMEBODY. BRINGS EXPLOSIVE EVIDENCE THAT'S COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO THE MATTER AT HAND. I AND REALLY IF THAT EVIDENCE DOES NEED TO COME IN IF IT IS RELEVANT. WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING THAT A DEFENSE ATTORNEY OR A PROSECUTOR. MAKE SURE THAT THAT ALTHOUGH X. EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT BEFORE THEY BRING IT AND. ESPECIALLY IN AN ERA WHERE. UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. I SAW OFFICERS BEING IN COURTROOMS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE IS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. THAT ALL PEOPLE WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO OUR COURTHOUSES. TAKEN THE WITNESS STAND IN PLAYING A ROLE IN THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION JUSTICE. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLEASE CHRIS RESPONSIBLE TRAILER THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND AWESTRUCK SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. SINCE OUR ELECTION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP OF THAT REITERATED TIME AFTER TIME COMMITTEE. MANY IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO AND TURN THE COURTROOMS ARE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF DEPORTATION BECAUSE OF ICE OFFICERS. ARE WEARING OUR NORMAL CLOTHING AND TRAIN AND DETAINING INDIVIDUALS. ON THIS EARLIER THIS YEAR I DOUBLE DOWN AND I'M ROAD A DIRECTIVE ITALIAN ICE OFFICERS OUGHT NOT TO DETAIN INDIVIDUALS INSIDE THE CORPORATE SAY THAT WEREN'T TARGETED. ARM BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO TARGET THAT THEIR EFFORTS FOR TARGET FOLKS HOWEVER ARE WE HAVE REPORTS THAT FOLKS HAVE BEEN. ODD DETAINED UPON FINDING OUT OF THEIR STATUS WEREN'T TARGETED OUTSIDE THE COURTS OUGHT TO KIND OF GO AROUND THAT DIRECTIVE. I THEREFORE WE CONTINUE THAT AMI GAVE WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP IN THE CONTINUE TO STATE THAT FAMILIES ARE WILLING TO GO. OUGHT TO COURT FOR EVEN THE SIMPLEST THINGS THIS TRAFFIC COURT ARCHES TO PAY A FINER ARE IFFY. ARE WE BELIEVE THIS MEASURE SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE TO ATTORNEYS ACROSS THE STATE TO. ENSURE THAT THE SITE SENSITIVE STATUS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S IS ARMED NOT USED ON THAT SIDE NEEDED HOT FOR THOSE REASONS WE'RE ABSOLUTELY IN STRONG SUPPORTER SENATOR. THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THIS. NO ONE IN SUPPORT. OVER. JERRY MEMBERS DOWN PUNK FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE COUNCIL HAD SOME WORKABILITY CONCERNED WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE BILL. WE WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSOR COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. AND OF THE MOST RECENT SETS OF AMENDMENT TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR COOPERATIVE. EFFORT HERE THE CURRENT VERSION AS WORKABLE FOR THE COURTS. THANK YOU. OTHER THAN SUPPORT IF YOU JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION. SYLVIA'S ALICIA ON BEHALF THE SITTING COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING OR ATTEND IN BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN STRONG SUPPORT. MICHELLE THOMAS SHOT REPRESENTING ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IT'S UNLIKELY. I NICK BROKEN HERE FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION. WHERE TWEENER WE ARE JUST PLEASED THOUGH TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BE* ALL THAT THE SUPPORT IT NOW HARD WORK AND EFFORT ON THE? BOND UP. ON THE PART OF FOLKS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SING NONE OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIMMY WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. BUT WE ARE STILL OPPOSED TO THE BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DETERMINATION ON THE RELEVANCE OF SOMEONE'S TESTIMONY OR THEIR CREDIBILITY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN OPEN COURT NOW WE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN. A REASONS WHY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT. THERE'S A A NEED TO PROTECT. FOLKS WHO COME FORWARD. BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND BECAUSE OF THE. ADMINISTRATIONS. CHANGE IN POLICY WITH RESPECT TO ON THE DEPORTATION OF UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS BUT WE THINK THAT THE CURRENT RULES OF COURT PERMIT THAT TO HAPPEN AND TO THE EXTENT THAT. THERE'S INFORMATION THAT IS. POSSIBLY. IRRELEVANT OR INADMISSIBLE. THAT. ANY PARTY WHO ARE TO THE PROCEEDING COULD RAISE THAT OBJECTION AND THE COURT CAN DEAL WITH IT IN THAT WAY. I AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE TO REMAIN OPPOSED THANKS THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IT OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SING NONE OF BRINGING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THE. YEAH THE UP STATION RAISES AN INTERESTING POINT WAS WERE DOING EVERYTHING TO PROTECT FOLKS NOW WHICH I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH. BUT AT SOME POINT SOME OF THESE RULES THEN MAY OR MAY NOT BE AS NECESSARY SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WE'RE. DOING AND AND MAY NEED TO REVISIT SOME SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND SOME ARE GOING TO SURVIVE AS CONCERNS AND PROTECTIONS THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY. NECESSARY SO I JUST THINK AS WERE DOING BILLS LIKE THIS WE NEED TO BE OF THE SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE TO THESE THINGS. THIS RACE THE MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU US CENTER WINNER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SOMETIMES WE DON'T RECOGNIZE. THE THE UNDERTONE OF IF THINGS ARE HAPPY IN OUR COURT ROOM AND I THINK THAT. DOT COM AT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER THAT CREDIBILITY ISSUES SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN OPEN COURT WILL AGREE WITH THAT. WHETHER SOMEBODY IS AN IMMIGRANT OR NOT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CREDIBILITY. AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE MISS THE MARK I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT. ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE RELEVANT THEIR GOING TO BE DISCUSSED IN OPEN COURT. BUT IF IT IS IRRELEVANT TO CAN ONLY CAUSE HARM TO SOMEONE HERE IN IMMIGRANT. BECAUSE HE WOULD BE USED AGAINST THEM IN A WAY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE. I AM VERY GLAD YOU BROUGHT FORWARD I THINK IT ALSO GOES TO THE FACT THAT. SO MANY TIMES WE HAVE WITNESSES AND EVEN VICTIMS WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO COME FORWARD. AND IT DOES BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE FOR ALL OF US WHEN VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE NOT WILLING TO COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE HARM THAT CAN BECOME TO THEM. OR TO THEIR FAMILIES SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU SCAN HIM. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS AND THEN. TWO QUESTIONS. ON THE COMMENT FRONT. GLAD TO SEE THE DA'S ASSOCIATION AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS BEHIND A BILL THAT'S AN UNUSUAL ALIGNMENT BUT I THINK THAT'S. INDICATIVE OF IT BEING GOOD POLICY I LIKE THE FACT. I THINK IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES STATUS IS PROBABLY NOT BE RELEVANT. I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT BE. ELEMENT OF A CRIME OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT. OR POTENTIALLY RELEVANT TO CREDIBILITY AND VERY ISOLATED NARROW CIRCUMSTANCE I LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S. SO THAT. AN INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE THING AND I THINK WITNESSED COOPERATIONS BIG PROBLEM. I THINK THE ITS BAD FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. A BAD FOR VICTIMS RIGHTS BAD FOR. THE RIGHTS DEFENDANTS I THINK IT'S BAD FOR EVERYBODY. WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY. AND I DON'T LIKE TRIAL BY AMBUSH I THINK IT'S. OF. AND A RONI ITS WAY TO PRACTICE LAW BUT LET'S NOT DELUDE OURSELVES PEOPLE DO IT. AND SO I THINK THIS PROPOSAL WILL WILL HELP. EMIRATE THAT CONCERN AS WELL. MY QUESTIONS ARE ONE. AND IS THERE ANY CONTEMPLATED REMEDY FOR SOMETHING THAT VIOLATES THIS. WOULD IT BE A MIS TRIAL SITUATION IF A PROSECUTOR VIOLATED OR WOULD IT BE. A SANCTION HERBAL TYPE THING AND IT'S FINE IF IT'S NOT BUT I JUST. CURIOUS AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DUE IF THIS PASSES AND IT'S PROBABLY OUTSIDE THE POLICY OF THE BILL BUT JUST IN TERMS OF? INFORMING THE BAR AND PRACTITIONERS BECAUSE THIS. IS A PRETTY BIG CHANGE IF THIS IS SIGNED INTO LAW HOW WE GOING TO LET. ATTORNEYS NOW SO THE PRACTITIONERS ARE NOT. RUNNING AFOUL OF THE NEW REQUIREMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK. AS WITH ANY. PROVISION AND THE EVIDENCE CODE OUT COURTS DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO. THANK CHAIRMAN ATTORNEY WHO. WHO VIOLATES A PARTICULARLY IF THAT'S NOT INNOCENT? VIOLATION. AND SO THEY DO HAVE THOSE TOOLS ARE AT THE STATE BAR ACTUALLY THAT SERVICES COULD THAT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AT THE SAME TIME THEY APPROACH ME. WITH HIS BILL IDEA THEY ALSO SUBMITTED A REQUEST TO THE STATE BAR TO CONSIDER RULE QUIRK. AND THE STATE BAR IS EVALUATING AYE DOT SO IT IS THEY THE STATE BAR MAY ALSO ADOPT ON ITS OWN A RULE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT SO THERE WILL BE THAT DUAL. ATTRACT BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE. GOOD IT WILL BE ENFORCEABLE AYE AND. BECAUSE I BELIEVE STATE BAR IS INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE OF I BELIEVE I'M CONFIDENT THEY WILL HELP GET THE WORD OUT SO THAT ATTORNEYS AT NO. AND THAT'S THE GOOD. POINTS MISTER VICE CHAIR WITH WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S. OFTENTIMES IN LITIGATION SOME FACTORS DRAWN TO TRY AND INFLUENCE A JURY ABOUT A WITNESS CREDIBILITY. BUT IN THIS CASE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BUT IT COULD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT THAT'S MENTAL FACTS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TESTIMONY AND THAT'S WHY. THIS IS A. VERY GOOD APPROACH BECAUSE. THOSE WITNESSES ARE GONNA BE FEARFUL FOR COMING FORWARD. IF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS JUST MENTIONED. AS A WAY OF INTIMIDATING A WITNESS THAN OTHER WITNESSES ARE NOT LIKELY TO COME FORWARD SO THAT'S THAT'S THE DILEMMA WE FIND OURSELVES IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS. SYSTEM THAT IS BY NATURE SET UP TO BE. CONTROVERSY AND AND AND DRIVEN. THE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS KALRA DIDN'T DISAPPROVE OF THANK MICHELLE VERY BRIEFLY. THANK YOU SENATOR WHEN THIS FLORIDA SOME OF THAT WORK IS A PUBLIC DEFENDER. OF FOR THAT IN YEARS I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO WORK. BUT BOTH. PUT THE DISK INTERNEES AND AS WELL AS PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO COME TO. A RESOLUTION THAT ALLOWED FOR BOTH TO TO DO THEIR JOB AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. I CAN THINK OF A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS WHERE IF. IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION A LOT OF. WITNESSES A OF MINE THAT I HAD IN DEFENSE OF CLIENTS WOULD HESITATE TO COME FORWARD AS WITNESSES. AND SO I THINK IT GOES BOTH WAYS IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT IMMIGRATION STATUS IS LEFT OUT AS IT SHOULD BE UP AS A RELEVANT IN THE FAR MAJORITY OF CASES. AND I APPRECIATE YOU. ESPECIALLY IN AND IN THESE TIMES UPPER RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CIGNA. TENERGY MAY CLOSE RESPECTFUL EFFORT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE'LL TAKE IT UP FOR ABOUT AS SOON AS WE DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO THAT TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AB THIRTY ONE EIGHTY NINE MISTER COOPER MONNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I SET THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AB THIRTY ONE EIGHTY NINE WOULD ALLOW A MINOR WHO IS TWELVE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. MS BEEN A VICTIM OF IT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE THE ABILITY TO CONSENT TO A MEDICAL CARE. TO SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EVIDENCE EXAMINATION WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT. CURRENTLY MINORS FOR TWELVE YEARS OLD. OUR OLDER KICKING SENT TO MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT IF THEY'VE BEEN RAPED OR SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. THE CANNOT FIT BEEN ABUSED BY PARTNER. MANY MINERS IN FEAR OF THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS FINDING OUT ABOUT THE ABUSE MAY NOT SEEK TREATMENT FOR ABUSE FROM A PARTNER. THIS BILL WOULD FIX THIS LOOPHOLE BELONG A MINOR WHO'S THE VICTIM OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE THE RIGHT TO GET MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHOUT PERIL CONSENT. THIS WOULD ELIMINATE AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF COMPLICATION OF VICTIMS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR MINORS WHO'VE BEEN ABUSED TO SEEK HELP. HERE WITH ME TESTS WHERE MEMBERS OF CAL SAFE. MICHELLE SEWERS AND HILLY LARKIN. OUR SPIFFY I THREE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF. THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHELLE SHORES I AM A FORENSIC NURSE EXAMINER. I'M HERE AT WITH OF.

KELSEY UPSET SPONSORED AB THREE ONE EIGHT NINE INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLYMAN COOPER. IN OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD WE HAVE FOUND THOUGHT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. THERE IS A AT IDENTIFIED GOT FORM VICTIMS AGES TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN. THAT ARE AFFECTED BY INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE INCLUDING STRANGULATION. CURRENTLY THERE'S A LACK OF LEGAL CAPACITY FOR THE FOR THIS VICTIM POPULATION TO CONSENT FOR MEDICAL CARE OR EVIDENTIARY EXAMS WITHOUT APPARENT. IN MY PRACTICE I HAVE FOUND THAT MINERS DO FEAR COMING FOR WITH THEIR PARENTS. WHICH CAN CREATE A DAY JUST BARRIER TO SERVICES. AB THREE ONE EIGHT NINE WILL BRIDGE THAT GAP AND BY ALLOWING MINORS OVER THE AGE OF TWELVE THE AUTHORITY TO CONSENT FOR MEDICAL CARE AN EVIDENTIARY EXAMS. A THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED ALSO E. B. THREE ONE EIGHT NINE BUT USES THE. GUY USES THE DEFINITION INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE TO BE MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITION JEWS BY THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE. BUT CDC FACT SHEET SHOWS THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE NATION OF OUR TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF FEMALES AND TEN PERCENT OF MALES HAVE EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. ADULTS REPORT THAT THEY BE THEY STARTED A. EXPERIENCING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IN THE HANDS OF INTIMATE PARTNER AT AGE OF AT THE EARLIEST AGE OF ELEVEN. ALSO ONE IN FOUR THAT ARE AFFECTED BY INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OF SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THOSE WILL HAVE A NON FATAL STRANGULATION. SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT REMOVING THAT BARRIER WILL ALLOW. TEENS TO COME FORWARD AND A LINE WITH THE SAME. RIGHTS THAT ARE IN THE FAMILY CODE FOR TWELVE AND ABOVE. THE CONSENT. THANK YOU OUT TAKE TWO MORE WITNESSES SO NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MY NAME IS HILARY LARKIN. AND I AM A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT I WORK AT HIGHLAND HOSPITAL IN OAKLAND.

FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THEM ARE ABOUT FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD THAN THAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT ACROSS THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. AREA. ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THOSE TEENS ARE ASSAULTED BY A CURRENT OR EXPORT PARTNER SO WE ARE SEEING THESE TEENS EVERYDAY IN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BUT NOT IN THE NUMBERS THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THEM. IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WORLD ABOUT WE SEE ABOUT FIVE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I CASES A WEEK. IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE FOURTEEN SINCE WE'VE BEEN SEEING AT REPORTING CASES WE'VE SEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES. ONLY TWELVE OF THOSE ARE VICTIMS BETWEEN TWELVE AND SEVENTEEN WHO WERE REALLY MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT THESE VICTIMS. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WHO ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN TO WHEN THEY CAN SEND. PATIENTS TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FOR TREATMENT ASSESSOR AROUND INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FATALITY REVIEW TEAM WHICH I'VE CHAIRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX HAS. STUDIED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DEATHS. I RELATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEVEN OF THOSE WERE MINORS. AND FOUR OF THOSE WERE KILLED BY THEIR INTIMATE PARTNERS. SO WERE SEEN OUR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE JUSTIN ALAMEDA COUNTY. AT A HOMICIDE LEVEL AT A SEXUAL ASSAULT LEVEL AND THE PHYSICAL ABUSE LEVEL. ON THE. THREE AT AB THREE ONE EIGHT NINE WOULD MAKE OUR JOBS SIMPLER IT WOULD GIVE US MORE. ACCESS TO THESE TEENS AND MAKE IT SIMPLER FOR A. HOT HIGH SCHOOL AND SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS REFER PATIENTS TO US TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED. I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD. SAVE LIVES.

HIV TESTING AND TREATMENT. MENTAL HEALTH CARE DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION ISSUES. THEY ALL HAVE THE RIGHTS FOR THOSE ISSUES THIS IS THE ISSUE INNER. INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ISSUE IS MISSING FROM THAT PIECE WEEKEND WHEN THEY COME TO US. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED CURRENTLY TO CONSENT TO THEIR TREATMENT AND CARE. WE CAN'T FUNNEL THEM INTO THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE ALREADY ENTITLED TO. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET PAST THIS BARRIER OF CONSENT. THANK YOU BRIGHT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

SO LET'S GO TO ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWELVE TWENTY FOUR NINETY SECONDS. IF THE TWENTY FOUR NINETY SIX. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA TRACKS A HIGH RATE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING DUE TO ITS STRONG ECONOMY LARGE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE U. S. MEXICO BORDER. A TWENTY TWELVE STUDY CONDUCTED BY SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT THE RATES OF LABOR TRAFFICKING OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN THE PROPERTY SERVICE INDUSTRY WERE AMONG THE HIGHEST OF ANY INDUSTRY. DESPITE EFFORTS TO CURTAIL ABUSE AGAINST PROPERTY SERVICE WORKERS ESPECIALLY JANITORS IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT TOO MANY BUSINESSES PAY ON IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRY. BY OFFERING THEM LONG HOURS WITH LITTLE PAY. EMPLOYERS FURTHER VICTIMIZE THESE WORKERS BY WITHHOLDING MANY OF THE RIGHTS THEY DESERVE AND THEY DO THIS BY MUCH CLASSIFYING THE WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. DOING SO RESULTS IN THE EMPLOYER BEING FREE FROM LEGAL OBLIGATIONS PERTAINED OF WAGE AND HOUR LAWS ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS AS WELL STATE AND FEDERAL SAFETY REGULATIONS. IT ALSO PREVENTS EMPLOYERS FROM BEING RESPONSIBLE TO PAY OVERTIME AND WORKERS COMPENSATION. IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN LABOR CODE SECTION TWO SEVEN FIVE ZERO POINT FIVE WAS ENACTED TO ENSURE THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE NOT WAS CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. IT PROVIDES A PRESUMPTION. OVER EIGHTY YEARS LATER A BEAT TWENTY FOUR NINETY SIX WOULD PROVIDE JANITORS AND OTHER PROPERTY SERVICE WORKERS THE SAME PROTECTIONS A PRESUMPTION. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO FOUR NINE SIX IS. MY WITNESS. RIGHT. WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING LADIES AND GENTLEMAN BILL MURPHY FROM THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE APPEARING ON BEHALF OF NANCY O'MALLEY. OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS I'VE DEVELOPED A SPECIALTY IN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY CRIMES AND LABOR TRAFFICKING I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH THE FINE PEOPLE FROM THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. THE EDTA THE DEPARTMENT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. WE'VE BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND. COMBATING CASES IN THE CARE HOME INDUSTRY THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. BUT THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRIES YOU ME. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S ALL BEHIND CLOSED DOORS LATE AT NIGHT. IMAGINE THIS ROOM AT ONE IN THE MORNING. THERE NO WITNESSES TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. THIS BILL WOULD OPEN UP THIS INDUSTRY TO ALL THE ENFORCEMENT AND INSPECTION ACTIVITIES. OF THOSE STATE AGENCIES I MENTIONED. AND YOUR LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES. IT WOULD PROTECT THE WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED BY CASES I WORK ON. STUDIES MENTIONED. AND OTHER REPORTS TO THOSE STATE AGENCIES. IT MIRRORS WHAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DONE BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. AND. IT FIXES A SMALL OMISSION. THERE IS A GREAT FIRST STEP TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REGISTER THESE JANITORIAL COMPANIES. BUT THE WAY IT STANDS RIGHT NOW IS ALL THOSE COMPANIES CAN JUST SAY. THEY'RE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. WE DON'T HAVE PAYMENT WEIGHTS WE DON'T PAY TAXES. WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY INSURANCE. AND OF THE INVESTIGATION. WITH THIS PRESUMPTION IT OPENS THE DOOR. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. THINK MARY CRAZE WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT. IF YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS GOVERNMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. GONZALEZ MCLA RESPECT LAST NIGHT OF. TAKE IT UP WHEN WE GET A QUORUM WE STILL HAVE A CORE OF SO STICK AROUND I AM SICK. RIGHT ITEM NUMBER NINE AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY TWO. MISTER CHAIR. I'D I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE FIVE AND SIX OF THE ANALYSIS THEY. SLAVIN AN INDONESIAN DOMESTIC WORK ON THEIR HOME FORCING HER TO. WORK BETWEEN SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY WITH NO PAIN NO DAYS OFF. THEY BE IS THIS VICTIM BY RETAINING HER PASSPORT MAKING HER BELIEVE SHOULD BE PHYSICALLY HARMED IF YOU DID NOT PERFORM HER DUTIES. IN ANOTHER SIMILAR CASE IN ORANGE COUNTY WOMAN WAS ARRESTED FOR KEEPING FIVE WOMEN ONE FROM CANYON FOR FROM THE PHILIPPINES AS SLAVES FOR HER FAMILY. I TWENTY FOURTEEN URBAN INSTITUTE STUDY FOUND THAT MANY VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING WERE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS MEANT TO CONTROL ENSLAVE THE VICTIMS INCLUDING THE USE OF DOCUMENT SERVITUDE. DOCUMENT SERVITUDE IS THE PRACTICE OF AN EMPLOYER WITHHOLDING AND IMMIGRANTS LEGAL DOCUMENTS FOR PURPOSE OF MANIPULATING THE EMPLOYEE. WITH A VAST MAJORITY OF LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS BEING IMMIGRANTS IT IS VITAL THE CALIFORNIA PROTECT THESE WORKERS BY PREVENTING EMPLOYERS WHO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY TWO HELPS PROTECT WORKERS AGAINST THIS PRACTIE BY PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK TO HOLD EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE WHO ENGAGE AND DOCUMENT SERVITUDE AND DETERMINING. A VIOLATION IS A MISDEMEANOR WITH THE POTENTIAL CIVIL PENALTY OF UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS IN WHICH EMPLOYER MUST PROVIDE A COPY TO EVERY WORKER. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY HAVE AS A WITNESS BEEN SAN DIEGO ADDED DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY LARA TANNING ON BEHALF OF. SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STUFF AND SPONSOR OF THIS BILL FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CARRYING THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. SHE AND OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR FEARS ADVOCATES FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN GENERAL. AND. OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN PROTECTING HUMAN VICTIM HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS FOR FOUR YEARS. BUT LABOR TRAFFICKING HAS REMAINED IN THE SHADOWS IT IS DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE AND ENFORCE. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ANY IN TWO THOUSAND AND EXCUSE ME BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. NATIONAL HOTLINES FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAVE RECEIVED OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CALLS OF SEX TRAFFICKING AND OVER TEN THOUSAND POTENTIAL CASES OF LABOR TRAFFICKING. BUT ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE POLARIS STUDY. WORLDWIDE FORCED LABOR IS BELIEVED TO BE MORE PREVALENT THAN SEX TRAFFICKING. IT IS UNDER REPORTED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THE VICTIMS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR LAWS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND DEPORTATION. AND MAYOR THREATENED CONSTANTLY WITH DOCUMENT SERVITUDE DEBT DEBT SERVITUDE. AND BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. IN A STUDY AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY OVER THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF SPANISH SPEAKING WORKERS HAVE EXPERIENCE AN INCIDENT MEETING THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRAFFICKING. IRONICALLY SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ENTERED THE UNITED STATES ON VALID WORK FORCE V. SAYS. BY THE TIME THEY FINISH THEIR EMPLOYMENT OR WITHIN A FEW YEARS SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF THOSE LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. HAD NO LONGER A VALID VISA AND WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. ONE FORM OF CONTROL AS THE AUTHOR STATED IS WITHHOLDING THEIR IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS AND THREATENING THEM WITH DEPORTATION. THIS OCCURS NOT ONLY A NAIL SALONS AND FOOD SERVICES AND IN JANITORIAL SERVICES AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED BUT IN JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER. LABOR SERVICE IN THIS COUNTRY INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION AGRICULTURE. A. DOCUMENT I EXCUSE ME DOMESTIC SERVICE SAYS. IMMIGRANTS AGAIN ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE IN SAN DIEGO ARE PROSECUTORS HAVE TALKED TO VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING. WHO'VE HAD THEIR VISAS WITH HELD THIS PROBLEM IS REAL AND THIS EXPLOITATION HOUSE TO STOP. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY TWO SHINES A LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE. EMPOWERS VICTIMS BY GIVING THEM VALID INFORMATION ABOUT OUR LAWS. AND ALLOWS THEM TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUE FACTS FROM THE FICTION THAT THEIR HE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS ARE EXPOSING THEM TO. THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US I BELIEVE WE ARE ACCEPTING THEIR. PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WAS GONZALEZ FLETCHER MAKERS. I I JUST WANNA THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING. OF THIS ALONG AND AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY. UNFORTUNATE SITUATION AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS TRAINS OFFICE I I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR YEARS FOR A. BILL DEALING WITH LABOR TRAFFICKING BECAUSE WE DO A LOT ON SEX TRAFFICKING AS WE SHOULD. ON BUT WE DO KNOW THAT LABOR TRAFFICKING IS ACTUALLY EIGHT THE LARGER PROBLEM AND ONE THAT WE NEED TO START TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO ADDRESS SO. I HOPE WE CAN MOVE THIS BELFOUR'S NINE RESPECT LAST NIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK. RIGHT MISS FRIEDMAN. GOOD ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB TWENTY. EIGHT OH TO. GOOD MORNING MORNING. MORNING CHAIR STONE A MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR HELP ON THE BILL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AS LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU AB TWENTY EIGHT OR TWO WOULD REQUIRED INSURER IN COOPERATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. TO IDENTIFY INSURANCE CLAIMANTS WHO OH PASTOR CHILD SUPPORT INTERCEPT THEIR INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND DIVERT THAT INCOME TO THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CRITICAL INCOME THEY RELY ON AND THAT TO WHICH THEY ARE. THEY ARE ENTITLED MANY FAMILIES WHO RECEIVE CHILD SUPPORT OFTEN DEPEND ON THIS INCOME TO MAKE ENDS MEET. RECENT ESTIMATES FROM DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SHOWTHEIR APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. OPEN CHILD SUPPORT CASES WITH PASSED DUE BALANCES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OWED AND PAST A CHILD SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA WAS SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. OF THE SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION OWED LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA INTERCEPTED ONLY'S NINETEEN MILLION THROUGH VARIOUS CHILD SUPPORT INTERCEPT PROGRAMS. THROUGH OUR VOLUNTARY INSURANCE INTERCEPT PROGRAM LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA INTERCEPTED ONLY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. SEVEN OTHER STATES CURRENTLY OPERATE SUCCESSFUL MANDATORY INTERCEPT PROGRAMS WHEN TEXAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED THEIR STATEWIDE INSURANCE INTERCEPT PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THEY SOUGHT INITIAL HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT INCREASE. IN CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTIONS AND COLLECTED AROUND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR ALONE. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH TWO IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN WHO DEPEND ON CHILD SUPPORT AS A SOURCE OF INCOME RECEIVE WHAT THEY DESERVE. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS KATIE AND HER OF CHILDREN NOW A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEVOTED TO PROVIDING CHILDREN WITH A VOICE IN POLICY DISCUSSIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S THE COMMITTEE IN MY NAME IS KATIE AND ZERO AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ASSOCIATE WITH CHILDREN NOW. A LEADING NONPARTISAN RESEARCH POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROMOTING CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON AB TWENTY EIGHT OR TWO. CHILD SUPPORT IS THAT CRITICAL INCOME FOR ELIGIBLE FAMILIES UNFORTUNATELY MOST FAMILIES ARE NOT RECEIVING ALL OF THE MONEY THAT THEY ARE OWED. AND AS WE JUST HEARD IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNPAID CHILD SUPPORT IS NEARLY EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S BEEN TWENTY TWO YEARS SINCE CONGRESS PASSED THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT WHICH ALLOWED STATE CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT ASSETS HELD BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SIXTEEN YEARS. SINCE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES CREATED THE CURRENT VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. SEVEN OTHER STATES HAVE CREATED MANDATORY ENSURE PARTICIPATION PROGRAMS HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IS STILL VOLUNTARY WITH LESS THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF INSURERS PARTICIPATING. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF INSURANCE MATCH SUCCESS STORIES FROM THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT INCLUDE FIFTY TWO. THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH PAID ALMOST HALF OF THE ARREARS TO A FAMILY WHO HAD NOT RECEIVED A PAYMENT IN ELEVEN YEARS. THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE DOLLARS PAID TO CUSTODIAL DIED IN A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO HAD NOT RECEIVED A PAYMENT IN THREE YEARS. AS YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE IN CASES LIKE THIS WHERE NON CUSTODIAL PISSED DIDN'T PARENTS ARE NON COMPLIANT WITH THEIR SUPPORT. INSURANCE INTERCEPTS CAN PROVIDE A CRUCIAL LIFELINE TO FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL STABILITY. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH TWO WOULD REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PARTICIPATE IN A LONG ESTABLISHED INTERCEPT PROGRAM IN ORDER TO FACILITATE COLLECTION OF OVERDUE CHILD SUPPORT AND HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY. OF LIFE FOR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO MAKE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF REALITY FOR THE CHILDREN IN THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THINKING. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROBERT HERALDICALLY COMMISSIONER FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHERE THE SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE LIKE TO THANK AGAIN THE AUTHOR AND HER FANTASTIC STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK. AS WELL AS YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR A THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS ON THIS I'M AS BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE LEAD WITNESS MENTIONED SEVEN STATES HAVE THIS. ITEM WE WOULD JUST URGE THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. WE LOOK TO GET AS MANY INSURANCE LINES AS POSSIBLE AS REASONABLY POSSIBLE INTO THIS. WHICH IS SIMILAR TO MANY OF THE OTHER SEVEN STATES AND NOT JUST LIFE BUT ALSO PROPERTY CASUALTY LINES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT CHAIR MEMBER ASPECT OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OUT WE LIKE FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING TO HELP CLARIFY SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE FOR HER COMMITMENT TO WORK CONTINUE WORKING WITH US AS WE PROCEED ON THE SPELL. THAT BACK CLARIFY SOME ADDITIONAL AFFECTS THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN SHRIEKING AT THE ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE AUTHOR STAFF. AND WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS BEING MADE ON THE FLOOR TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CUNNINGHAM. I WOULD. JUST LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL. I JUST HAD ONE QUICK TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT THE IMMUNITY PROVISIONS. ARE THEY. WHAT WHAT ARE THEY IN THE BILL CURRENTLY IN? DO YOU FORESEE ANY CHANGING THEIR STRIPPING AWAY OF THE IMMUNITY I THINK. REASON* SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT. FEATURE OF THE BILL TO MAKE THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORK WELL. RIGHT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES AREN'T HELD LIABLE. THROUGH AN ERROR BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF AN INSURANCE COMPANY ACTS AS A PARTY IS A. IN BAD FAITH THAT THERE IS A WAY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE INDIAN COMMUNITY CLAUSE IN THE IN THE BILL. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CNN IS THREE MILLION RECORDS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF KIDS OUT THERE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU WILL TAKE UP. ASSUMING WE GET A QUORUM. GARCIA. STYX'S TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT A. B. TWENTY SIX THIRTY SIX. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES. PROUD TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY SIX. THIS BILL IS A PROCEDURAL MEASURE THAT WOULD CREATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FUND INTO WHICH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. MAY DEPOSIT MONEY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE NEWLY CREATED BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. YOU GAVE YOUR OF MISSION IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES THAT IN VERY DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. TO INVESTIGATION ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. THE COMMUNITIES OFTEN LACK THE RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE OR LITIGATE CASES THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH. JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE RESERVED FOR COMMUNITIES WHO CAN AFFORD THE TO INVESTIGATE AND LITIGATE PARTIES. THAT BREAK THE LAW BY STOP MOTION SUPPORTING THE WORK OF THE EPA BUREAU WE ARE TALKING. TAKING THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ASSIST IN THESE COMMUNITIES WHO OTHERWISE SUFFER POOR HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES THEY'RE MUCH MORE COSTLY TO STATE IF LEFT ON. ADDRESSED ONE THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL THEM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT THAT WITH ME. MARIO THE BERNARDO WHO IS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO TESTIFY. WE HAVE. THANK YOU. WITH THIS PLACE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARIO DIBERNARDO AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HOBBY ARE BUT SARAH WHO'S PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. I DON'T LIKE TO THINK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR HIS THOROUGH IN AND FAIR ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. THE BILL WOULD CREATE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FUND WHERE FUNDS CAN BE DEPOSITED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND UP FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION WORK CONDUCTED BY DOJ'S RECENTLY ESTABLISHED. BUREAU IN FROM OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THE HARSH REALITY IS THAT SOME COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF POLLUTION. FROM INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT POORLY AND USE DECISIONS AND TRANSPORTATION. MEETING THE NEEDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES REQUIRES ARE FOCUSED ATTENTION. THAT'S WHY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CREATED THE BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. BJ BUREAU WILL HELP PROTECT PEOPLE COMMUNITIES THAT INTO OUR DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. THROUGH INVESTIGATION ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY SIX SIMPLY ESTABLISHES A SPECIAL FUND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FUND THAT IT WOULD UP THAT WOULD ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TO BUY. EXCUSE ME TO DEPOSIT FUNDS. SUCH AS SETTLEMENT AND PENALTY MONIES FROM CASES THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO THE E. J. BUREAU. JUST TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE POTENTIAL CONFUSION. THAT. HAS COME UP WITH THIS BILL THE FUND IS NOT INTENDED TO CREATE A BOUNTY SYSTEM WHERE THE AG TAKES CASES TO OBTAIN REVENUES TO FUND THE BUREAU. THAT WOULD NOT BE SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE TO SUPPORT THE BUREAU. ESPECIALLY SINCE MANY OF THE J. CASES WILL FOCUS ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SEEKING A BUDGET REQUEST ENSURE THE BUREAU SUPPORTED BY GENERAL FUNDS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OPPOSITIONS. POINT OF VIEW HIGH LATE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ANALYSIS. ALSO THE J. BUREAUS NOT RESTRAINED BY THE CALAVERAS SCREENS DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE BUREAU CAN TAKE ON CASES INVOLVING COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITIES ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOUR I THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AND OF US BECAUSE WE ARE BEHALF A CALIFORNIA RUNS TO SO I ANSWERING.

THIS ALSO MAKES THAT STICK TO CREATE A FUND ALLOW FOR SOME. FLEXIBILITY AND ENSURE THAT OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE IN FACT HAVING THEIR ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED AS WE TRIED SOLVE SOME OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. YOU FOR. BRINGING THE SWORD NICKY WAS CHAIR. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SING NONE MISTER GARCIA YOU MAY CLOSE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME RESPECT RESPIRABLE. THANK YOU SIR.

I UNDERSTAND WE'LL TRY TO GIVE AS MUCH LATITUDE AS WE CAN BUT. WE CAN GET THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS BACK AS WELL WE WE HAVE YET EVEN ESTABLISH A QUORUM. BUT LET ME IF I COULD START BY PRESENTING. AB TWENTY ONE P. FIVE THAT'S ALRIGHT NUMBER THREE PLEASE GREAT THANK YOU. UP COLLEAGUES THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL IN LITIGATION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY AFTER COURT CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF RELEVANT FACTORS. UNLIKE OTHER STATES THAT DO HAVE STANDARDS FOR PLAINTIFFS TO PURSUE LITIGATION WITH A PSEUDONYM CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE SUCH A STANDARD. THERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS MAY BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO PROTECT PRIVACY AND SENSITIVE AND HIGHLY PERSONAL MATTERS WHEN THERE'S A RISK OF RETALIATORY PHYSICAL HARM. OR DURING THIS TIME IN HISTORY WHEN A PLAINTIFF LEGITIMATELY FEARS ARE REVEALING ONE'S IDENTITY COULD SUBJECT HIM OR HERSELF TO DEPORTATION. GIVEN THE CURRENT NATIONAL CLIMATE MANY IMMIGRANTS ARE EXTREMELY HESITANT TO APPEAR IN COURT OR OTHERWISE TAKE PART IN PROCEEDINGS. BECAUSE OF THIS FEAR IMMIGRANTS WOULD OTHERWISE TESTIFIES WITNESSES IN CRIME OR PURSUE LEGAL ACTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT ONE MINOR PLAINTIFFS NEED TO HAVE AN APPOINTED GUARDIAN AD LITEM BUT THEIR PARENTS ARE NOT DOCUMENTED. OUR BILL WOULD REQUIRE A COURT TO CONTINUE CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR ANONYMITY. AND ANOTHER PARTY COULD CHALLENGE THE USE OF A PSEUDONYM. AYE AND OF A COURT ORDER IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THAT LIVE AGAIN THAT LITIGANT COULD DISMISS CLAIMS WITHOUT PREJUDICE. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSOR MODIFYING AND TURN IT OVER TO MULL THIS WITNESS. A QUICK WARNING WHICH AIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JANET SUNNY BUT THEN I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY FROM ALL LEFT. THE MEXICAN AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FIVE. AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FIVE ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN STATE LAW ITEM WHERE WE REALLY DO NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR FOLKS WHO DO WATER. EITHER. GO THROUGH CIVIL LITIGATION WITH A PSEUDONYM OR FICTITIOUS NAME. AND WHAT MOST COURTS DOING CALIFORNIA AS THEY DO FOLLOW THE FEDERAL RULE HOWEVER OUR LITIGATORS HAVE SEEN INCONSISTENT RESULTS ESPECIALLY WITH OUR CLIENTS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A HARDER TIME. TRYING TO TRYING TO CONVINCE JUDGES Y. SOMEONE WAS UNDOCUMENTED MAY WANT TO PROCEED WITH A PSEUDONYM. FOR ME WANT TO PROCEED WITH A FICTITIOUS NAME AND SOMEOF THE RESULT. WE ARE WE WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS BILL TO PROVIDE THE STATE WITH SOME MORE UNIFORMITY AND TO HOPEFULLY GET MORE CONSISTENT RESULTS BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT OTHER VULNERABLE. POPULATIONS OUTSIDE OF JUST IMMIGRANTS. FOLKS WHO MAY FEAR. PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HARM SOMEONE WHO IS A SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM SOMEONE WHO'S A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM. I'M WOULD BE ABLE TO PROCEED OUT UNDER A FICTITIOUS NAME OR A PSEUDONYM AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE CASES WHERE. MODIFIES BEEN UNABLE TO PURSUE LITIGATION BECAUSE OF OUR CLIENTS BEING TOO AT BEING AFRAID TO EXPOSE THE TO IDENTITY. SO IN A DHAKA EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CASE WE HAD A POTENTIAL CLIENT WHO ULTIMATELY DECLINED TO BECOME A PLAINTIFF BECAUSE HE REALLY FELT. AFRAID OF HAVING IS TO IDENTITY BEING EXPOSED ONE BECAUSE OF MAYBE FUTURE. THEN ABILITY TO SECURE FUTURE EMPLOYMENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT ONE X. EXPOSE HIS FAMILY AS UNDOCUMENTED AND EXPOSE HIS PARENTS AS WELL. IN AN EDUCATION DISCRIMINATION CASE WE HAD A CHILD WHO WAS BEING FORCED TO TAKE LANGUAGE CLASSES THAT I'M HE DIDN'T NEED IT BUT AS PARENTS WERE TOO AFRAID. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CASE BECAUSE OF THEIR UNDOCUMENTED STATUS AND THEN LASTLY IN A GUARDIAN AD LITEM CASE ITEM WE FILED A SUIT ON BEHALF OF IN AND OUT OF AN ANONYMOUS MOTHER. AND HER THREE CHILDREN BUT THE COURT REJECTED THE MOMS ADAM GUARDIANSHIP REQUEST BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE OUR CHIU NAME. SO WE CANNOT BRING A MOTION TO FILE THE CARDING GUARDIANSHIP APPLICATIONS UNDER SEAL. AND IN ORDER TO DO SO YOU YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO SERVE THE DEFENDANT'S. AND SO FORTUNATELY THAT KEEPS WE WERE ABLE TO GET AN A AN EMERGENCY EX PARTE REQUEST. A FILE THESE APPLICATIONS UNDER SEAL BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS. BECAUSE CONSIDERABLE A CONSIDERABLE DELAY TO FOUND THE PROTECTION OF THESE CLAIMS. AT BECAUSE THIS BILL PRETTY CLOSELY MIRRORS THE FEDERAL RULE AND AND DEFINITELY DOES HAVE A DID DELINEATES A CLEAR PROCESS WE THINK IT'S. IT'S IT'S JUST A MUCH NEEDED BILL GIVEN THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION TARGETING COURTHOUSES IT'S NOT. TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE JUST UNDER CONSTANT FEAR RIGHT NOW AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS OUT WE URGE AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ANYONE IN BETWEEN. MORNING TERRY MEMBERS TAMPON FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. WHEN WE REVIEWED THE BILL WE HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH THE INTRODUCED. A VERSION OF THE LEGISLATION WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE NEW DIRECTION IN THE. CURRENT IMPRINT VERSION THE BILL WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSOR. AT IN PUBLIC IT'S THE COMMITTEE STAFF AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM E. WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION.

IN THE PROCESS OF THE COURT MAKING THE DETERMINATION HERE. I'M AS WELL AS TIGHTENING UP. THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE SO THAT IT CANNOT BE ABUSED BY THOSE THAT WISH TO MASK IN AND SEEK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THIS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE ON THAT IN AND THE BILL'S SPONSORS AS WELL AS YOUR STAFF. AND WE HAVE NO POSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU.

DO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU LET ME HAVE JUST FIRST STEP THANK SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT JUST SPOKE OUT RAISING THEIR CONCERNS AND WE CERTAINLY. LOOK FOR TO ENGAGE WITH THEM AND AND OUR INTENT IS NOT FOR EXAMPLE TO PREVENT. NEWSPAPERS FROM THE TABLE TO ADEQUATELY COVER CASES AND AND LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT TO REGION GOOD RESOLUTION ON THAT ADJUST ALSO MENTION ONE. HISTORICAL POINT WHICH IS. POTENTIALLY THE MOST. FAMOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CASES THE ROE V. WADE CASE AND JANE ROE WAS A PSEUDONYM FOR A WOMAN WHO DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE AT THE TIME THE CASE WAS BROUGHT. ON IN PROTECTING HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CHOOSE ARM AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE. AN ADEQUATE STANDARD. THAT ADDRESSES. AGAIN THE NEEDS FOR PRIVACY AYE IN IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES SO OUT WITH THAT. IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR REAL TRUE ACCESS TO THE COURTS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL AND RESPECT WE ASK FOR SUPPORT THE RIGHT TIME. THANK YOU. RIGHT ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE. THANK YOU LET ME FIRST START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I ANY STATE THAT THIS BILL. AB TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE WOULD ADDRESS IMBALANCES IN THE CURRENT TENANT NOTICE AND EVICTION PROCESS WHICH IS STACKED AGAINST TENANTS AT THIS TIME. I THINK EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IS AWARE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY EXPERIENCING IN CALIFORNIA THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE HISTORY. BUT WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING A TENANT CRISIS AND AN EVICTION CRISIS WITH THE HIGHEST RENTS IN THE COUNTRY WITNESS STATE THAT IS. FORTY SIX PERCENT RUNNERS WERE ONE THIRD OF ALL RUNNERS ARE PAIN OVER HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON RENTS. WERE SEEN EVICTIONS IN DISPLACEMENT WHICH HAS LED IN PART TO THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR STATE. ACCORDING TO RECENT DATA. WE'VE SEEN THIS PAST YEAR FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND EVICTION FILINGS LEADING TO AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN EVICTIONS A DAY. FORTY ONE THOUSAND OF ACTIONS TOTAL. IF THOSE FORTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE ADDICTED THIS PAST YEAR COMPRISED CITY. THE CITY OF OBJECTIONS WOULD BE LARGER THAN TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOPEFULLY THE IMPACT OF ADDICTIONS IS OBVIOUS BUT. HEALTH ON EDUCATION ON COMMUNITY INSTABILITY. AND EVICTION PLACES A MARK ON A PERSON'S RECORD AND CREDIT SCORE BARS THAT PERSON FROM MOVING INTO A GOOD HOUSE IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD. PREVENTS THE PERSON FROM MOVING INTO PUBLIC HOUSING. THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO PREVENT AVOIDABLE INFECTIONS WITH REASONABLE TIME FOR TENANTS TO RESPOND TO MA'AM OUR FILINGS THREE THREE WAYS FIRST BY EXTENDING THE TIME TENANTS HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERM OF THE LEASE. TODAY A TENANT ONLY HAS THREE DAYS THREE DAYS. ARE TO PAY LAKE RENT OR QUIT. IF AND OF SERVED ON A FRIDAY THAT LEAVES ATTENDED UNTIL MONDAY TO ACCESS BANKS ARE CLOSED OVER WEEKEND. AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE NOT SERVE BEFORE HOLIDAY. CALIFORNIA IS IN A MINORITY OF STATES WITH ONLY A THREE DAY NOTICE. RELATED TO NOT PAIN RENTS A MAJORITY OF STATES HAVE A THREE OF A NOTICE PERIOD OF FIVE. THIRTY DAYS WITH MOST FALLING% BETWEEN SEVEN AND FOURTEEN DAYS HERE IN THIS BILL WE PROPOSE TEN. SECONDLY THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND THE TIME TENANTS HAVE TO RESPOND TO AN EVICTION LAWSUIT. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE DAYS WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOUR SERVED ON THE THURSDAY BEFORE A LONG WEEKEND YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. BECAUSE YOU HAVE BASICALLY THE DAY A DAY AND A HALF OF A BUSINESS TO FIND A LAWYER PREPARE YOUR ANSWER TRAVEL TO THE COURTHOUSE. AND I LIKE TO POINT OUT IN MOST CIVIL CASES YOU OFTEN HAVE THIRTY DAYS. PREPARE YOUR FIRST ANSWER THIS BILL PROPOSES A FOURTEEN DAY TIMELINE FOR RESPONSE. THE BILL ALSO MAKES OTHER CHANGES TO FRIEND EVICTION CASES WITH LEGITIMATE DEFENSES FOR EXAMPLE TO REQUIRE THAT A NOTICE TO QUIT IS SENT THAT IS CENTRAL LANDLORDS CLEAR. TO ENSURE ALSO THE SUMMONS ARE PROPERLY SERVED EXCEPT. NOW WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FUND AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES FROM THE WESTERN CENTER AND FROM THE LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FIRST I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM CHAU. CHIU HERE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. REYES. SO WE DO HAVE A CORE. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BRUCE. I'M ALEXANDER HUNTING WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WE'RE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL TOGETHER WITH THE CRLA FOUNDATION. ELECTED THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR AUTHORING AB TWENTY THIRD. TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE. AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS RISING RENTS AND INCREASING HOMELESSNESS IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO PREVENT AVOIDABLE INFECTIONS. THAT CAN BE RESOLVED WITHOUT DISPLACING TENANTS FROM THEIR HOMES. THIS BILL TAKES MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT TENANTS ARE PROTECTED IN PRACTICALLY ADDRESSING ISSUES WITH THEIR LANDLORDS HAVE A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY WITH NOTICES TO PAY RENT FOR SECURE A BREACH OF POLICE AND KNOW HOW TO DO SO. AND ARE ABLE TO PRESENT THEIR DEFENSE IS ONE EVICTION CASES ARE FILED AGAINST THEM IN COURT. LAST FISCAL YEAR ALMOST FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS HAD UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASES FILED AGAINST THEM IN JUST THE LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT SYSTEM. AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THOSE THAT MAY HAVE. MOVED OUT AFTER RECEIVING AN EVICTION NOTICE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T COMPLY WITH THEM THE THREE DAYS. CALIFORNIA'S AMONG THE STATES WITH THE SHORTEST NOTICE PERIODS FOR EVICTIONS AND LEGAL AID PROGRAMS WE WORK WITH ARE OVERWHELMED BY CLIENTS. WERE FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES NOT BY THEIR UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES BUT BUT BY THESE TYPE TIME LINES UP TO COMPLY WITH NOTICES AND TO FILE THEIR ANSWERS IN COURT. DESPITE HAVING STRONG CASES THE ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT THAT LANDLORDS ARE DEMANDING OR TO FIX A BREACH OF THE LEAST IF GIVEN A FEW MORE DAYS THESE TENANTS ARE LEFT WITHOUT RECOURSE AND OFTEN END UP HOMELESS. EXISTING LAW GIVES TENANTS IN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES THAT LEAD TO EVICTIONS. AND AB TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE MAKES THAT OPPORTUNITY MEANINGFUL. IT GIVES TENANTS A REASONABLE TIME TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE WITH A PAYCHECK OR GOVERNMENT BENEFITS OR TO SEEK HELP IN ADDRESSING A BREACH OF THEIR LEASE. AND ENSURES THAT ALL PARTIES CAN PRESENT THEIR EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENTS. DURING THE COURT PROCESS. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KAREN CONCERT I AM AN ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL SERVICES AND I THINK CALIFORNIA ALSO KNOWN AS LESNICK. WE ARE THE LEGAL AID AGENCY FOR TWENTY THREE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES FROM SACRAMENTO TO THE OREGON BORDER. WE ASSESS LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF CIVIL LEGAL ISSUES BUT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE OUR CLIENTS CONTACT US ABOUT. THROUGHOUT OUR TWENTY THREE COUNTY SERVICE AREA IS HOUSING. WE ASSIST THOUSANDS OF TENANTS FACING EVICTION EVERY YEAR. OUR OFFICE THE SAYS MANY TENANTS WHO ARE HARMED BY THESE SHORT TIME PERIODS IN WHICH THEY ARE REQUIRED TO CURING ALLEGE LEASE VIOLATION. OR RESPOND TO AN EVICTION ACTION IN COURT. EVERY WEEK WE SEE CLIENTS WHO HAVE REACHED OUR OFFICE TOO LATE TO FILE AN ANSWER IN AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION. BECAUSE THERE FIVE DAYS TO RESPOND TO A SUMMONS HAS PASSED. A DEFAULT JUDGMENT HAS BEEN ENTERED AND THEY HAVE LOST THE CHANCE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN COURT. RIGHT NOW IS IF A PERSON HAS SERVED WITH A SUMMONS ON A WEDNESDAY THEIR ANSWER IS DUE MONDAY. THAT GIVES THEM THREE BUSINESS DAYS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS NEEDED TO RESPOND WHERE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY CAN GO TO FOR HELP. HOW TO ACTUALLY GET THERE? AND THEN TO GET TO COURT TO FILE AN ANSWER. MANY CLIENTS IN THE MORE RURAL PARTS OF OUR SERVICE AREAS. HAVE TO FILE THEIR ANSWER IN PERSON AT THE COURTHOUSE AND PAY LARGE FEES WHEN THEY CANNOT AFFORD THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO FILED BY FAX. THEY MAY LIVE ONE TO TWO HOURS AWAY FROM COURT. AND OFTEN LACK ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OUR ELDERLY DISABLED AND CANNOT MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO GET TO COURT WITHIN THE SHORT FIVE DAY PERIOD. GIVING THESE TENANTS MORE TIME TO RESPOND TO A SUMMONS WILL MEAN THAT MORE TENANTS WHO HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN COURT. REMAIN HOUSE AND AVOID HOMELESSNESS. CURRENTLY AT OUR OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO HAS THREE CLIENTS EACH WITH A DIFFERENT LANDLORDS WHO EACH RECEIVED THREE DAY NOTICES TO PAY RATHER QUIT AND WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE FULL AMOUNT OF RENT. PROSPER IN THE NOTICE PLUS LATE FEES SHORTLY OUTSIDE OF THE THREE DAY TIME. WHEN EACH DIFFERENT CLIENT ATTEMPTED TO PAY THEIR DIFFERENT LANDLORDS THEIR RENT WAS REFUSED NOT A PIECE OF FICTION. AND THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING HOMELESS. FURTHER WE HAVE A CURRENT CASE IN THE SACRAMENTO OFFICE WITH A CLIENT WHO IS ELDERLY AND DISABLED. AND A VETERAN. WHO WAS HOSPITALIZED WHEN HIS LANDLORD SERVE TEN THE THREE DAY NOTICE TO PAY RENT ARMY ABOUT? WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL HE FOUND THE NOTICE IT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE THREE DAYS BUT HE ATTEMPTED TO PAY HIS FULL AMOUNT OF RENT DEMANDED IN THE NOTICE. HIS LANDLORD REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE RENT. AND IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE EVICTION ACTION. UNFORTUNATELY THESE EXAMPLES ARE NOT THE EXCEPTION THE SITUATIONS ARE COMMON IN. OUR CLIENTS WHEN THEY GET BEHIND ON RENT. IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE SOME OF THAT HAPPENED IN THEIR LIFE SUCH AS THE HOSPITALIZATION AND EXPENSE OR JOB LOSS WITH ONLY THREE DAYS TO CURE. AN ALLEGED LEASE VIOLATION MANY YOU'RE UNABLE TO DO SO WE HAVE NO DOUBT. THAT EXTENDING THE TIME FOR WHICH A TENANT CAN CURE LEASE VIOLATION SUCH AS GETTING CAUGHT UP IN RED WILL MEAN MORE TENANTS WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR LANDLORDS REMAIN HOUSE AND AVOID HOMELESSNESS COMMITTEE NEED TO TO WRAP UP PLEASE. AND THINK OKAY THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT. BRIEFLY MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIAN TO CAST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION PLEASED TO COSPONSOR. THIS BILL AND FOR ALL THE REASONS ARTICULATED BY THE THREE PRIOR SPEAKERS WE WOULD URGE IN ABOUT. IF YOU. ANYONE. ELSE IN SUPPORT. COME FORWARD AND JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE I S. I'D LOVE TO REGISTER MY SUPPORT. JONAH STRAUSS OAKLAND WAREHOUSE COALITION. I'D LIKE TO THANK MR CHIU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THINKING TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERING IT AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS AN EX AYE WERE WHERE DON'T TESTIMONY THIS POINT FUNDS ARE JUST TAKING FOLKS WHO WERE. IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND SUPPORTERS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEW WELLS. JERRY MEMBERS THEN POEM FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL WE HAVE REQUESTED A DELAYED OPERATIVE DATE AMENDMENT TO ALLOW US TO MAKE THE NECESSARY RULE INFORMED CHANGES. AND CONSIDER THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF THE BILL IS ENACTED AND AND WE'RE WORKING WITH AUTHOR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND SPONSORS ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. MORNING GOOD MORNING. I'M WOULD BE PROUD WHAT THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE AS A PRACTICING ATTORNEY BEFORE COMING TO SEE A. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS DO NOT LIKE TO TERMINATE A TENDENCY OR PROCEED WITH EVICTIONS. IT'S EXPENSIVE AND IT'S TIME CONSUMING. AND PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD MUCH RATHER WORK WITH TENANTS IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES. THIS BILL WILL ADD WEEKS UP FRONT TO THE ADDICTION PROCESS. AND PROVIDE TENANTS WITH WEEKS OF FREE RENT OUT THE FRONT AND. AB TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE MORE THAN TRIPLED THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT TENANTS HAVE TO CURE THEIR NON PAYMENT OF RENT OR OTHER RELEASE BREACHES. INCLUDING FOR RENT AFTER IT'S ALREADY PASSED DO. FOR THE MAJORITY OF LANDLORDS WHO ALREADY PROVIDE AGREES PERIOD THIS WILL NOW MEAN THAT THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH. TO GET THERE RENT OR TO BEGIN THE EVICTION PROCESS OF THE REC ROOM REMAINS UNPAID. THIS BILL WILL PUT UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASES ON PAR WITH ALL OTHER CIVIL CASES IN THE STATE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T JUST ADDRESS NON PAYMENT ALSO ADDRESSES SITUATIONS WHERE THE TIME HAS ENGAGED IN NEW SENSE CREATED A NEW SENSE OR ENGAGED IN A LEAVE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. AS WE HEARD EARLIER ON MISTER SANTIAGO'S BILL ARE RELATED TO THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER IS FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE STRUGGLE WITH AND IT HARMS THE OTHER TENANTS IN THE COMMUNITY. WON THE ELECTION THE AFFECTION PROCESS IS DELAYED. SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS TO RELY ON THE RENT TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE UTILITIES INSURANCE AND TAX BILLS. SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO GO MONTHS ON END WITHOUT A RENT PAYMENT. IN ADDITION THIS BILL PREVENTS TERMINATIONS OF TENANCY ANYTIME A TENANCY A TENANT MAKES ANY SORT OF COMPLAINT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S ABOUT. A POLICY. THAT IS ILLEGAL IN ANY WAY. AND OUT FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. EXODUS. EXCUSE ME HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THAT COMMITTEE RUN KINGSTON I REPRESENT FOR REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SOUTHERN CITIES. EAST BAY ORANGE COUNTY EGGMAN NORTH VALLEY. WE TO WAY JOIN THE OPPOSITION IN THIS BILL WOULD LIKE TO PEEL THE ONION BACK IF YOU WILL TO. LOOK AT ITS TRUE IMPACT TODAY IN AND NOTICE A THREE DAY NOTICE TO PAYER QUIT. IT'S NOT JUST TO PAY RENT WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW. IT'S ALSO TO STOP. THE OFFENDING AND OTHER OFFENDING. TENANT. STOP PLAYING THE STEREO AT TWO THIRTY IN THE MORNING WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLE. TO GIVE THAT OFFENDING TENET CREATING THAT DISTURBANCE. ADDITIONAL DAIS. IT IS A STEP THAT IS A SUBSTANTIAL ARE ISSUE FOR ALL THE OTHER TENANTS THAT HAVE TO ENDURE CONCERNING NON PAYMENT OF RENT THE THREE DAY NOTICE. THREE DAY NOTICE IS A REMINDER NOTICE THAT YOU STILL PAY THAT NEED TO PAY YOUR RENT WHICH YOU AGREED TO LET'S SAY IT'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. ALMOST EVERY LEAST IN RENTAL AGREEMENT TODAY HAS A GRACE PERIOD. THAT GRACE PERIOD IS USUALLY FIVE DAYS IF YOUR RENT IS DUE ON THE FIRST. THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU CONSERVE THAT NOTICE IS THE SIXTH DAY OF THE MONTH. AND THEN YOUR RENT WOULD BE OTHERWISE TO ON THE KNIFE. IN THAT SITUATION THAT SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME WHAT. MISTER CHU IS RECOMMENDING IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE TO THAT SO THE THREE DAY NOTICE TO EXTEND. IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US AND IT'S THAT'S ONE TWO REAL QUICK LIKE. THE FIVE DAY NOTICE TO ANSWER. THIS IS A COPY OF THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER FORM FOR AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER RESPONSE. TODAY THE TENANT HAS. S. MISTER CHU AND WITNESSES INDICATE FIVE DAYS IT WOULD LIKE THEY ARE REQUESTING A SUBSTANTIAL. INCREASE. HOW DIFFICULT IS PLEADING WITH THE RESPONSE CHECK A BOX ON PAGE ONE? YOU SIGNED IT. AND YOU DATA. THAT SAID THERE IS NO COMPLICATED THE ISSUE IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE. I GENERAL DESCRIPTION REGARDING WHY YOUR RESPONSE TO IT RESPONDING TO IT AND DISPUTE THIS. IT YOUR OPTION THAT NO COURT WE.

BY A TENANT THIRD AND FINALLY. THERE'S A THERE'S A REQUEST FOR ONCE THE COURT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE TENANT IS IN DEFAULT. TWO WEEK STAND THAT INTEL. FOR FOURTEEN DAYS UNTIL SUCH TIME. THAT. THEY COULDN'T THAT. THE LANDLORDS ATTORNEY CAN FILE A REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IF YOU WELL. THIS. IN GENERAL TERMS IS WELL DOWN THE PIKE OF A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS LATER. ED WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. THERE IS MORE TIME WHAT IS ALL THIS BOIL DOWN TO. WE KNOW THAT THAT THE TENANT HAS AGREED TO PAY RENT. THE CHAT IS CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO IT. WE DON'T IMMEDIATELY ACT ON THAT AS THE THAT THAT YOU NEED TO DO IT. THIS IS THEY WERE GENERALLY AN AMICABLE RELATIONSHIP. AND WE ARE LEAD AROUND LIKE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. AND FOR THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR NO FAULT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY APARTMENT ASSOCIATION.

AND IF IT'S IN THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THE INCREASE IS ONLY TWO DAYS THAT'S CORRECT. AND THE PROVIDING TWO WEEKS TO READ TO FILE A RESPONSE. UNLAWFUL DETAINER TRICON FROM FIVE DAYS TO FOURTEEN DAYS. THE QUESTIONS GOVERNMENT'S. RIGHT SINGER WAS CHIU MIKLOS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEET FIRST AGAIN THANK THE COMMITTEE OF FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST CLARIFY. TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS ARE REQUEST AROUND DELAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE TO ALLOW FORMS THAT IS. PERFECTLY FINE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SO WHERE WE'RE WILLING TO DO THAT. THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT REASONABLE TIME FRAMES AND AND WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW. BY EXTENDING THREE DAYS TO TEN DAYS FOR ADDING MONTHS TO THE PROCESS. BUT WE'RE REALLY ENSURING OUR THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT AVOIDABLE OBJECTIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT A FEW EXTRA DAYS THAT WOULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STAINING APARTMENT. AND BEING KICKED OUT ON THE STREET THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HOME AND HOMELESSNESS KIDS BEEN ABLE STAND SCHOOLS PARENTS BEEN ABLE TO HANG ON A JOBS. ASIDE NOT HAVING TO PAY FOR THE IMPACT OF ADDICTIONS ON THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OUR HEALTH SYSTEM AND. I KNOW THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT WE MODES AND TENANTS ALL WANT TO MAINTAIN AN AMICABLE RELATIONSHIP BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SITUATION WHERE. THAT RELATIONSHIP HAS NOT. HAS TERMED SOMETHING LESS THAN AMICABLE LA WHEN SOMEONE'S BEEN GIVEN A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS AND SEVENTY TWO HOURS YOUR LIFE WILL BE COMPLETELY OVERTURNED AND WHAT WE ARE SUGGESTING IS. WHICH PROVIDE A FEW ADDITIONAL DAYS SO THAT THAT HOPEFULLY DOESN'T HAPPEN ARE I OF COURSE AM LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN OUR. STAKEHOLDERS IN THE OPPOSITION AND TO HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO GOOD PLACE BUT. VERY MUCH RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WORST EVICTION AND TENANT AND HOUSING CRISIS OUR STATE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED. THANK YOU. SO WE. I AM ABLE TO TAKE A MOTION THE MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SO THERE'S A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU. KALRA PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO CHAU. CHIU TYPE CHIU AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN NO RACE. REYES I. THAT HAS FOUR SO WE'LL PUT THAT BILL ON CALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO BONTA. YOU HAVE TO ITEMS WITH THIS LET'S TAKE ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SIX. THE FACT IS THAT CLICK OKAY SO. I. SOME. ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SIX MOST ABOUT IS BEING PULLED UNTIL NEXT WEEK CORRECT OKAY I WILL ALSO ANNOUNCE THAT ITEM NUMBER TEN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SIX. A CHILD'S BILL HAS BEEN PULLED FROM OUR AGENDA AS WELL AS ITEM FOURTEEN. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT BERTUCCI. SO THOSE THREE BILLS ARE CURRENTLY OFFER AGENDA SALUTE GO TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN. THIS WATER THEY MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN. AND FOR THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE PUT INTO THIS MEASURE. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN WOULD ESTABLISH A CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT. OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE CERTIFICATION WILL ENSURE LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS HAVE BASIC EDUCATION UNFAIR PRACTICES AND TENANT RIGHTS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RENT THE PLACE THEY CALL HOME WITH INCREASING HOUSING COSTS THE NUMBER OF RENTERS IN THE STATE IS ESTIMATED TO CONTINUE. TWO GROW WHILE CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS LANDLORDS FROM ENGAGING IN DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR THERE IS NO FORMAL EDUCATION. ON FAIR HOUSING OR TENANT RIGHTS THAT LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE IN ORDER TO RENT AND OPERATE A RESIDENTIAL. UNIT. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN WOULD CREATE ELABORATE PROPERTY MANAGER EDUCATION CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT CAN BE COMPLETED IN PERSON OR ONLINE. THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING APPROVING APPROPRIATE FIGHTERS OF THE EDUCATIONAL COURSEWORK CERTIFICATION WOULD BE GRANTED UPON COMPLETION OF COURSEWORK ON SUBJECTS SUCH AS ADDICTIONS AND NOTICES. LIMITATIONS ON ACQUIRING IN DISCLOSING IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP STATUS AND PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE THINK THIS IS A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS ARE AWARE OF THE ONGOING CHANGES TO TENANTS RIGHTS. AND M. AND THE LAWS. I THINK THAT. THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF LANDLORDS WHO ARE WELL MEANING BUT NOT MAY NOT BE FULLY INFORMED OF THE LATEST LAWS AND. THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT APPLY TO THEM IN THE RIGHTS THAT THEIR TENANTS MAY HAVE SO THROUGH EDUCATION WE THINK WE CAN GET THOSE OUT WELL MEANING LANDLORDS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE APPROPRIATE LAWS ARE ENFORCED. AND FOLLOWED. I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I VOTE I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JOIN A STRAUSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OAKLAND WAREHOUSE COALITION THANK YOU AND THEIR NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS ARE COUPLE OF SECTIONS OF A MEMBERS ARE LISTED IN THE BILL. AND YOUR YES WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING AMENDMENTS AND. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT THAT COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER TODAY WERE TAKING THOSE MOMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLATES. I THINK IT WAS WRONG TO THINK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND JOHN STRAUSS OAKLAND WAREHOUSE COALITION. ONE OF THE GREATEST DRIVERS OF DISPLACEMENT IS LACK OF EDUCATION. ON BOTH THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORD SIDE BETTER EDUCATION AND TENANTS RIGHTS AND LANDLORD RESPONSIBILITIES CAN HELP MITIGATE THE HOUSING CRISIS ON A LARGE SCALE. IN OAKLAND WE ACTUALLY HAVE RELATIVELY GOOD TENANTS RIGHTS BUT MANY LANDLORDS CHOOSE TO IGNORE THE PROCEDURES LAID OUT IN A RENTED JUST MEANT PROGRAM. AND SOME SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THAT IT EXISTS. SO CERTAINLY THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT ARE OPEN WAREHOUSE COALITION BRINGS TENANTS AND LANDLORDS TOGETHER TO IMPROVE SAFETY IN ON PERMITTED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES AS WELL AS PERMITTED SPACES. SIMPLY TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT ESTABLISHED AND NEW HOUSING HABITABILITY LAWS CAN BE ENOUGH TO COOL DOWN CONTENTIOUS NEGOTIATIONS US ESPECIALLY. IN THESE MONTHS SINCE THE KINGSHIP BUYER THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE AND. SO BASIC MANDATORY CERTIFICATION ALLOWS PROPERTY OWNERS TO MINIMIZE THEIR LIABILITY IN THE BAY AREA WE SEE FRAUDULENT AFFECTIONS POP FOLLOWED BY UNLAWFUL EVICTION AFFIRMATIVE SUITS WITH GREAT FREQUENCY AND WOULD LIKE TO TURN THAT AROUND WE SUPPORT THE SPELL THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN ORDERS A CREAM THREE CM BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS A HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN. A WE DID ATTEMPT TO. REACH A DEAL WITH THE AUTHOR BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE ABLE TO SEE UNABLE TO SECURE AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO COMMITTEE AND SO WE REMAIN OPPOSED. BECAUSE THE BILL DOES REQUIRE ALL REAL ESTATE LICENSEES TO COMPLETE A MANDATORY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PERFORM SERVICES THE THREE RD LICENSE TO DO UNDER EXISTING LAW. ALL REAL ESTATE LICENSEES OR RD SUBJECT TO. OVERSIGHT AND A RELOCATION AUTHORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE. AND SUBJECT TO THAT. OVERSIGHT RELOCATION AUTHORITY FOR MANY THINGS INCLUDING. FEELING TO IT HERE TO. STATE FAIR HOUSING LAWS. AND SO WITH THAT. WE DO. REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL OF THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS DO NOT SATISFY OUR CONCERNS AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU KNOW VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING DEBORAH CARL TO THE CALIFORNIA FOR APARTMENT ASSOCIATION A TO CLARIFY WE'RE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. WE DO ENCOURAGE EDUCATION IN FACT WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE INTRODUCED THIS BILL WERE SIMPLY LOOKING FOR SOME MORE CLARITY. AND HOW MANY HOURS A WEEK MUST BE TAKEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF EDUCATION BECAUSE. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY PARTICIPATED IN. CRAFTING SOME OF THESE LAWS THE BOOKS ARE. INCHES AND INCHES THICK SO WE WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ON WHAT TYPE OF EDUCATION. AND OF COURSE. AS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE AT THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS THERE'S A LOT OF EDUCATION IT'S ALREADY REQUIRED BY MANAGEMENT COMPANY PERSONNEL. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM EXEMPTED BECAUSE WE THINK THERE ARE. POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF OWNERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS COURSE SO WE MAY WANT TO TALK ABOUT A TIME DELAY IN MAKING SURE THAT WE GET. THE THE LANGUAGE CRAFTED CORRECTLY AND THE EDUCATION COURSES CREATED IN TIME. SO WITH THAT. WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR OF MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT. EXCUSE A MISTER STONE OF MEMBERS COMMITTEE RUN KINGSTON REPRESENTING THE SAME FOUR APARTMENTS SITUATIONS THAT WE. TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL IS REALLY REALLY WHY. AS NOTED BY. IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IT IT. STATES THAT IT APPLIES TO TEACH AN OWNER OF TWO WERE MORE UNITS. AND. TO COMPLETE THIS COURSE WORK IN SPECIFIED TIME PERIODS BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION. THE SCOPE. THERE ARE NUMBERS OF COMPANIES. THAT HAVE A LOT OF PERSONNEL NOT DIRECTLY IF AFFILIATED OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT AND DATA DAY MANAGEMENT. CONTACT BETWEEN THE TENET. AND. THE COMPANY. THAT. SHOULD BE EXEMPTED. BAD VERY SPECIFICALLY CRAFTED RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT. AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE TO. THERE ARE NUMBERS OF CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE ALL THE SUDDEN? YOU INHERIT PROPERTY THE FOLLOWING DAY YOU INHERIT A FOUR PLEX. THIS HAS NO GRACE PERIOD NOTHING YOU CAN CAN YOU COLLECT RENT CAN YOU PERFORM THE SERVICES OF A TENANT. COMPLAINS ABOUT ABOUT THIS ALL OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES ARE NOT ADDRESSED WE HAVE MET WITH THE STAFF OF MISTER BONTA. AND. OUT SOME OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE MET IN THE DISTRICT ABOUT THIS THESE ARE IN WHAT WE WANT TO SAY TO YOU IS. THIS IS NOT. KIND OF FULL FULLY COOKED YET THIS IS A MATTER OF. THAT WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL AND CRAFTING I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT AN LLC. A PARTNERSHIP IN A IN A DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE ONE PERSON HAS A CERTIFICATE THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T THE DISSOLUTION HAPPENS. THE NEXT DAY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CERTIFICATE. I DON'T I REALLY DON'T KNOW THESE ARE HUGE PROBLEMS. LLC'S LE ALL THAT IN ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE RAISING WITH YOU WE WOULD HOPE THAT THIS BILL REALLY SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSES SO IF YOU WANT TO TARGET AND HAVE PEOPLE BE FAMILIAR. THIS COULD BE GREAT FOR AN APARTMENT ASSOCIATION A REALTOR ASSOCIATION DRIVE FOR MEMBERSHIP TO WRITE. IF YOU REFLECT KIND OF THINK ABOUT IT. BUT. OVERALL WE WANT TO TARGET LASER TARGET HAVE PEOPLE BE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAW IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED A COURSE OR YOU HAVE A SPECIAL. CERTIFICATE BY THE. ON APARTMENT ASSOCIATION TRAINING ALL THESE. LANDLORDS THIS IS NOT JUST TWO HOURS BUT. DAYS OF COURSE WORK SHOULDN'T THAT BE SATISFACTORY IT GOES WAY BEYOND WHAT MISTER BONTA HAS ENVISION THAT SHOULD BE EXEMPTED BECAUSE THAT SHOULD BE SATISFIED. SKIN IN OUR JUDGMENT SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THANK YOU REALLY NEED TO BE WORKED OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS THIS DRESS. I AM I AM I THERE'S NO QUESTION EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE EDUCATION FOR DEALING IN ANY KIND OF A BUSINESS. WE DON'T REQUIRE THIS OF OTHER BUSINESSES THEY CAN OPEN UP THEIR SHOP AND THEY HAVE A BUSINESS AND THEY'RE PROVIDING. EITHER SERVICE OR A. POOR SELLING GOODS WITHOUT BEING REQUIRED TO BE CERTIFIED. TO OWN A BUSINESS AND. THAT IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS. THAT IF YOU JUST OWN TWO UNITS YOU ALREADY ARE REQUIRED TO DO THIS. HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED BUT ANOTHER ISSUE OF COURSE IS THE LANGUAGE SO NO THE COURSES WILL HAVE TO BE OFFERED. IN MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF EDUCATION I THINK IS GOOD. BUT. THE ACQUIREMENT OF A CERTIFICATION. IT FOR SOMEONE WHO OWNS. SO LITTLE. IS OF CONCERN AYE AYE I DO HEAR THAT YOU ARE STE WORKING WITH THE. WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW THAT. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT I'M SURE IT WILL BE DEALT WITH. AS YOU GO FORWARD ON THIS. BUT THOSE ARE SOME CONCERNS. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SING NONE. SPONSORED YOU MAY HELLO THANK YOU AL OUT A LOT OF GOOD POINTS REYES AND I JUST WANNA THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR THOSE POINTS I THINK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS IS IS ONE THAT WE WANT TO WORK ON AND. AT THE TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR TO HELP MAKE THE. THE BUILD STRONGER I WANT TO START WITH. THE REALTORS AND I THANK THEM FOR FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.% MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET FULL APPROVAL OF A FORMAL POSITION BY TODAY. BUT. WE. ARRIVED AT A PLACE I THINK. CAN CAN I AM. THAT I BELIEVE THEY HAVE SAID THAT THAT I BELIEVE OR IN THEIR. NEUTRALITY GOING FORWARD WE JUST WANTED TO FINALIZE THAT TODAY SO I DID WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT FOR THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION AND. ALSO FROM THE COMMITTEE. OF OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THE DETAILS THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS SO SHE SHOULD ASK FOR OUR ARE APPROPRIATE AND AND THEY SHOULD BE IN THERE AND AND WE WILL WORK ON THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY ON THE TOPICS TO BE TAUGHT THE NUMBER OF HOURS. THAT WILL BE USED TO. THAT FOR THE LEARNING WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE OVER THE BURDEN SOMEBODY WANT TO BE SIGNIFICANT WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE. SOMETHING THAT. IT DOESN'T CRITICS UP A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN THE EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF OF THE LANDLORDS AND AND PROPERTY MANAGERS. LANGUAGE ACCESS IS CRITICAL. WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THAT GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE PROPERTY MANAGERS AND LANDLORDS THAT THAT I'M. NEED COURSES AND AND LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH HAVE THEM SO THAT THEY AS A THAT THAT. EDUCATION IS APPROPRIATE. IT YOU KNOW I WAS GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO ARM THEM ISRAEL'S WAS SAYING ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE DON'T LICENSE OTHER BUSINESSES WE WOULD LIKE IT'S A LOT OF THINGS IN IN ENOUGH IF. FOR. YOU KNOW THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS WE KNOW WE LICENSE BARBERS AND AND OTHERS BUT WE DON'T LICENSE LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT PEOPLE'S HOMES ABOUT THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD THE SHELTER THAT THEY HAVE FOR THEM IN THEIR FAMILY. AND I THINK WE SHOULD. AND I I'LL ARGUE THAT THAT OUT WHEN YOU MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE OF SUCH FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO A PERSON OR FAMILY AND AND CALIFORNIAN. THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE RULES ARE AND THE LAWS ARE THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABIDING BY. AND AND THAT THAT WILL CREATE A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP AYE WITH TENANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO. I'M. YOU KNOW THIS THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN THIS BILL ISN'T FULLY COOKED IT'S NOT FULLY COOKED. THE FIRST HOUSE IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE OF THE INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND UP OPPOSITION AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CONSULTANTS AND CHAIRS ALWAYS MAKE IT BETTER. AND TO AS WE ALWAYS ARE OPEN MINDED. TO USE THE SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE A STRONGER BILL GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT THAT BONES OF IT ARE GOOD AND STRONG AND EVERYONE THAT'S SPOKEN OUT HAS SAID THAT THEY AGREE THAT EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT. AND SO. I AFTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE BILL STRONGER AS WE GO FORWARD TO ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU AND I USED TO LIKE TO GIVE THE OUT THE LAST WORD BUT I WANT TO SAY I MEAN YOU'RE MY MAYBE IT. YOU HAVE AREAS THAT YOU WANT TO WORK ON FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT IT SATISFIED. THE CONCERNS THAT THAT. I WAS RAISING AND THAT THE THEY KEEP FROM OUR STANDPOINT. WE FELT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED AND SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT IT'S IN A FINE STATE I THINK TO MOVE FORWARD. YOUR WELCOME TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE AREAS AND AND. FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T UNDERMINE YOUR YOUR FINAL STATEMENT BUT JUST PROCEDURALLY TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT FROM MY SOMEBODY THAT'S WHAT THE ANNOUNCER SHOWS THAT.

ALTHOUGH IT IS UNFORTUNATE MANY WORKERS TODAY FACE ISSUES OF DISCRIMINATION EXPLOITATION HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION. OF AN EMPLOYEES DISCUSS ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR EMPLOYMENT WITH OFFICIALLY IN REPRESENTATIVE MOST ALREADY ASSUME THAT SUCH COMMUNICATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL THAT INFORMATION MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED THE EMPLOYER OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. HOWEVER NO STATE STATUTE PROVIDES SUCH COMMUNICATIONS WITH AN EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE NOR HIS CASE ALL RECOGNIZE. A PRIVILEGE. THIS EXTENDS TO INCIDENCES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT HARASSMENT WHEN A PLEA PREFERS TO APPROACH HIS ARE HERE HER. UNION REPRESENTATIVE RATHER THAN THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT. UNION REPRESENTATIVES ARE IMPORTANT THIRD PARTY WHEN THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE EMPLOYEE IN MIND. AT A TIME WHEN THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AS EMPOWERED WOMEN AND OTHERS TO REPORT AND SPEAK OUT. ABOUT HARASSMENT THE WORKPLACE ADDITIONAL CONFIDENTIAL AVENUES TO REPORT THESE INCIDENCES ARE IN GREATER NEED. AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE WOULD ADD UNION AGENT AND REPRESENT WORKERS ARE RECOGNIZED PATCHWORK EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE ALONG WITH ELEVEN EXISTING TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS TEAM PRIVILEGE. BY ALLOWING EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE BETWEEN WORKERS AND YOU MET YOU REPRESENTATIVES WE CAN HELP TO ENSURE THE SAFE PRIVATE AND FULL DISCLOSURE OF WORKPLACE CONCERNS AND NEEDS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE CHAIR AND THE EXCELLENT RIPPLE OF THE REPORT. FROM COMMITTEE STAFF I THAT I THINK IS AN IS A WONDERFUL JOB. OF BOTH DESCRIBING OF THE GOALS OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION. IN A VERY THOROUGH MANNER. IN WITH THAT. I'D RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT AND WITH THE PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY ARE MICHAEL'S A SEVILLE EXEC DIRECTOR VASTLY DISTRICT COUNCIL FIFTY SEVEN. AND CAITLIN BAKER CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHAEL SEVILLE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THAT'S ME COUNCIL FIFTY SEVEN I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THAT PLAYS OUT OUT MORE REGULARLY THAN MOST MAY THINK ARE IN THE LABOR RELATIONS AT FIELD AYE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HAVING BOTH BEEN A UNION AGENT. AS AN ATTORNEY BOTH IN PUBLIC HAVE BOTH IN HOUSE IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN THOSE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT. THE QUANDARY THAT HIS CREATE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LABOR LAW. PUTS A THAT THE UNION AGENT AND A REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN A SITUATION. WHERE THE UNION REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE SEEKS THE ADVICE AND GUIDANCE THAT THE UNION AGENT IS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UNDER THE DUTY OF FAIR REPRESENTATION? AND AND THE. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT. THAT THAT PROCESS HAS CREATED AND PUTS BOTH PARTIES IN A SITUATION IN WHICH. A BOOK FOR AN ELECTION OF REMEDY I DECISION MAY BE MADE WHETHER TO PURSUE A A GRIEVANCE TO THE CONTRACT OR TO GO THE JUDICIAL ROUTE. IT AND SEEK LITIGATION. THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE UNION AGENT AND REPRESENT AN EMPLOYEE CAN BECOME DISCOVERABLE THROUGH A SUBPOENA BY THE EMPLOYER AND I HAVE FACED NUMEROUS. INSTANCES IN WHICH A SUBPOENA IS ISSUED A AND AND. INTERNAL DOCUMENTS. CONFIDENTIAL INTIMATE WRITTEN A COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE UNION AGE AND THE REPRESENT EMPLOYEES ARE THEN FORCED TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE EMPLOYER IN USED. A AGAINST THAT EMPLOYEE ARE IN LITIGATION NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES THE ABILITY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO THROUGH THIS SKELLY INVESTIGATORY PROCESS UNDER THE CONTRACT OR THROUGH DISCOVERY. DEPOSITIONS AND I THINK AN EXAMINATION A IN LITIGATION. PREVENTS THEM FROM DOING THEIR-JOB IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE HANNAH AND QUESTION EMPLOYEES OR WITNESSES TO ANY INCIDENT THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED AT THE WORKPLACE BUT THIS ADDRESSES THE QUANDARY BOTH LEGAL AND ETHICAL. THAT THE UNION AGENT AND THE AND THE EMPLOYEE ARE PUT INTO WHEN THEY BEGIN TALKING ABOUT AN INSTANCE THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED AT THE WORKPLACE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT. PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AGAIN I THINK THE THE COMEDIAN AND MISTER CHAIR FOR HEARING THIS TODAY AND WE URGE A. AND I AM IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS WITH MR CHEN MEMBERS KITTEN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WHERE CO SPONSORS UP THIS BILL AND WE WERE SPONSORS OF THE ORIGINAL MEASURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE UNION PLAYS A REALLY ESSENTIAL ROLE IN HELPING TO PROBLEM SOLVE AT THE WORKPLACE AND THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN WORKERS KNOW THAT THEY CAN COME AND SPEAK TO THE UNION WRAP. IT IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU AS THE UNION REP TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION TO PROVIDE ADVICE TO SEEK OUT OTHER WORKERS TO FIND OUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. TO HAVE OFF THE RECORD CONVERSATIONS WITH MANAGEMENT ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HELPS YOU TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS WITH OUT HAVING TO BRING IN LAWYERS SO I FIND IT KIND OF IRONIC THAT. UP OPPOSITION HAS SUCH A PROBLEM WITH THIS IDEA THAT WORKERS WOULD BE ABLE TO TALK CONFIDENTIALLY WITH THEIR UNION REP WENT SO OFTEN THAT HELPS YOU AVOID LITIGATION HELPS YOU AVOID PROTRACTED. SPIRITS BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS MORE INFORMALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THAT FULL COMMUNICATION. I WORKED AS A UNION REP FOR MANY YEARS BEFORE I CAME HERE TO SACRAMENTO. AT THAT TIME IT WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ME THAT I COULD BE FORCED TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT MEMBERS TOLD ME CONFIDENTIALLY THERE IS SUCH A. AN ASSUMPTION ON THE PART OF THE PARTY IS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GRIEVANCES WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE WORKPLACE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S AROUND A MORE SENSITIVE TOPICS LIKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. RACIAL DISCRIMINATION A BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A RETALIATION FAVORITISM ALL KINDS OF ISSUES THAT HAPPEN AT A WORKPLACE THERE IS THAT EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. AND I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ALLOWING THE UNION REP TO DO THAT ESSENTIAL PROBLEM SOLVING ROLE WITH OUT HAVING TO ADVISE WORKERS. IF YOU TELL ME THAT I COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE TO BE A WITNESS AGAINST YOU THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE IN A FORMAL LEGAL SETTING WITH THINK THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF WORKERS. OF THE UNION AND OF THE EMPLOYER IN MAINTAINING HARMONIOUS LABOR RELATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT US WITH MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OFF WHAT WILL GO WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES WE WOULD LIKE TO ECHO OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE THROUGH COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES ON THIS ISSUE. AND FOR THE REASONS THAT OF OUR EVEN DISCUSS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION. MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE PLACE INTERNATIONAL UNION ALSO SUPPORT. GEN MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST MILLION SUPER SUNDAY AFTER THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND SUPPORT. SENATOR BREAUX ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SAY NONE OPPOSITION. IF YOU CHRIS AND SPACE FOR. AND THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND CHAIRMAN STONE A JENNIFER BROWN BEHALF CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO A A. AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE I JUST WANTED TO REFERENCE A FEW THINGS DONE IN THE ANALYSIS WITH REGARDS TO WHO IS THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE YOU CAN APPLY THE PRIVILEGE YOU CAN REFUSE. FOR ANOTHER THIRD PARTY TO DISCLOSE THE PRIVILEGE I THINK THE CONFUSION ON WITH REGARDS TO OUR INTERPRETATION IS THE DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY THAT IS UTILIZED WITHIN THAT EXISTING PARAGRAPH IT GOES FROM YOU NAY AGENT. UNION AGENT REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE FORMER REPRESENTING EMPLOYEE TO EMPLOYEE AND FORMER EMPLOYEE THOSE ARE LIKE FIVE DIFFERENT PARTIES ALL INCLUDED WITHIN THAT SAME PARAGRAPH AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT STATUTORY INTERPRETATION. THE JNA COURT WHEN APPLYING THIS WILL LOOK IN ME. AND SOON THAT THE. LEGISLATURE MEANT TO USE DIFFERENT TERMS. IN THAT SECTION AND WE'RE CREEK CONFUSION WITH REGARDS TO THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE WHO IT PLACE TO WHO CAN REFUSE DISCLOSURE WHO CAN ASSERT THE PRIVILEGE THAT WE HAVE. AYE CONFUSION ON THAT AND RIGHT NOW IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHAT THEY'RE NOT ON THE UNION AGING COULD IN FACT OF. A ISSUE THE PRIVILEGE AND I PREVENT A THIRD PARTY FROM ESSENTIALLY DISCLOSING ANY OF THIS COMMUNICATIONS. THAT LEADS US EVEN IF IT WAS JUST ONLY THE REPRESENT OF EMPLOYEE WHO COULD ASSERT THE PRIVILEGE WE WOULD STILL HAVE CONCERNS WE DO BELIEVE. ON THAT THIS COULD INTERFERE WITH INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE WORKPLACE AND WITH REGARDS THE ANALYSIS THAT SAYS THIS IS AN AVERAGE THREE PRIVILEGE THAT ONLY COMES UP AN ADJUDICATORY. ADJUDICATORY UP PROCEEDINGS WE THINK THE APPLICATION OF A PRIVILEGE IS MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE THAN THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE IF AN EMPLOYER WERE TO GO AND INVESTIGATE A WORKPLACE ISSUE. AND. ASK THE EMPLOYEE WHETHER OR NOT HE CONSULTED AND TURNING THE ATTORNEY EMPLOYEE RESPONDED YES THAT EMPLOYER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ASK DURING THAT INTERVIEW WHAT THE COMMUNICATION WAS BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY AND THE CLIENT. BECAUSE AGAIN THEY WOULD ASSERT THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE IF THEY DIDN'T IF THEY DISCLOSE THAT COMMUNICATION WOULD NO LONGER BE A PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION AND SO I THINK THE APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVILEGE GOES FAR BEYOND EDGE AS SIMPLY A COURT PROCEEDING. OR SIMILAR TYPE OF PROCEEDING BECAUSE IT'S UTILIZED ALL THE TIME TO ASSERT. THE PRIVILEGE WHENEVER A CONFIDENTIAL OR POTENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION IS REQUESTED TO BE DISCLOSED EVEN IN AN EMPLOYMENT INVESTIGATION SO WE HAVE CONCERNS WITHOUT AS WELL. WILL SERVE OUR CONCERN THAT THIS. DEFINITION OF THE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION GOES FAR BEYOND JUST ADVICE GIVEN BY UNION AGENT AND INCLUDES ANY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WITH REGARDS TO A VICE BY THE UNION AGENTS WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH HOW BROAD THAT TERMINOLOGY IS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CREATES A ONE SIDED SITUATION IN THE EMPLOYMENT. SITUATION THERE IS NO MANAGERIAL PRIVILEGE THAT WOULD BE CORRESPONDING TO THIS WOULD ONLY BE WITH REGARDS TO UNION AGENT AN EMPLOYEE AND SO IT PREVENTS ON FULL DISCLOSURE ON BOTH SIDES AND CREATES THIS IMBALANCE IN THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WHICH WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS TING HUTCHINS DELETED CALIFORNIA CITIES. ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE WITH THEM COMPANY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO NOTE THAT. AT THE GOVERNOR TO FEELS AYE AYE SHARES THE SAME CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN IN VETOING A SIMILAR MEASURE AND AND EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE. QUOTE. IT WITH REGARD TO THAT BELLY SAYS IS FOR CREATIVE ENTRY PRIVILEGE I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS A PERFECT BUT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE UNION. ON EQUAL FOOTING AS A COMMUNICATIONS ONE SPOUSE PRESUPPOSITION OUR ATTORNEY. AND. THE GOVERNOR ALSO SHARES OUR CONCERNS THAT THIS COULD COMPROMISE THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYERS TO CONDUCT THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION THE WORKPLACE AND THEN. THE PROPONENTS BRING UP THE THE MAJOR MOVEMENT AND AND THOSE AYE DEBILITY FOR THOSE TO CONDUCT A INVESTIGATION PROCEED COUNSEL. WE FEEL THE SAME THING WHICH IS WHY THE ONE TRY TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS AND FOR THE REASONS THAT MISS PRAYER STATED I'M WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULDN'T HAVE AT THAT. WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S BOTH GOOD MORNING DOROTHY JOHNSON OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALL MY MY COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES ALSO IN OPPOSITION THIS MORNING THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. AND. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. FIND THIS ONE HERE. AND THAT MOTION AND THE SECOND IS THAT. IS DO PASS. SO I THINK THAT THERE THE ISSUE BROUGHT UP ONE OF THE ISSUES BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE THE TERMINOLOGY THAT CAN EASILY BE ADDRESSED BY JUST ADDING REPRESENTED BECAUSE IT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF THOSE FOLKS AND. I THINK THAT. A LOT OF SOME OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION WAS SAYING. THE OLDER THE PRIVILEGE OBVIOUSLY IS THE EMPLOYEE IN THIS CASE NOT THE REPRESENTATIVE AND I DO IN FACT DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S REASONS FOR VETOING THE BILL BECAUSE. WE DO HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE I THINK WE WANT TO CREATE? AVENUES FOR AT AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THAT OUT HAVING. THAT WHOLE CONVERSATION OPENED UP MANAGEMENT CERTAINLY CAN DO THAT THEY CAN BRING IN ATTORNEYS THEY THEY HAVE PROCESSES ULTIMATELY TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH. WITH CONFIDENTIALITY AND IN TALKING TO SOMEONE IN A WAY THAT IS NOT ULTIMATELY THAN. DISCOVERABLE. AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO. I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT'S IT'S APPROPRIATE THIS PLACE IT CREATES THE RIGHT KIND OF I THINK THE RIGHT KIND OF BALANCE AND GIVES AN EMPLOYEE SOMEPLACE TO GO. WITH SOME CONFIDENCE AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE AFFIRMATIVELY REGARDLESS OF THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MATCHES SETTING UP A PROCESS WHERE EMPLOYEES IN ANY ORGANIZATIONS. HAVE HAVE A A CONFIDENTIAL A TRUSTED. INDIVIDUAL WITH WHOM THEY CAN CAN TALK TO WHO HAS THEIR INTERESTS IN MIND. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS. SING NONE MISTER KALRA YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHARE. AND ONCE AGAIN YOUR STAFF ONE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS IN CLOSING AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK MY BOAT. THANK YOU. SO THE MOST IS DO PASS KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CHAU. CHIU. GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN KALRA AYE KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN AYE RAYOS. REYES I.

AND THIS BILL DOES HAVE SUPPORT SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU ADD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS. AB THIRTY TO ELEVEN REVISED OPTIONAL ORGAN DONATION SECTION OF THE STATUTORY ADVANCE HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE MODEL FORM TO MATCH BEST PRACTICES ENHANCE HOW WE HONOR INDIVIDUALS CHOICE. REGARDING ORGAN DONATION THE CURRENT ADVANCE DIRECTIVE ALLOWS PRINCIPLES TO RESTRICT DONATIONS THEY SPECIFY DOES NOT REQUIRE A LIST ORGANS THEY WISH TO DONATE THE IMPROVEMENT IN AB THREE TO ALL OF ELEVEN VERY ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE. WHAT INCLUDE OF NUMBER ONE A CHOICE FOR A VERY BROAD AFFIRMATION OF ORGAN DONATION AND ALSO SPACE TO WRITE DOWN ANY RESTRICTION OR LIMITATION IS THE PRINCIPAL? WANTS TO IMPOSE NOT JUST RESTRICTION ON THE TYPES OF ORGANS OR TISSUES. THE BILL ALSO HARMONIZES A DONOR'S CHOICE BY DISCLOSING THE POTENTIAL USE OF TEMPORARY MEDICAL PROCEDURES UPON DEATH WHICH MAY CONFLICT WITH OTHER END OF LIFE CHOICES AND THE DIRECTIVE. LASTLY THE BILL MORE CLEARLY EXPLAINS THE DONOR WHAT THEIR CHOICE MEANS. I DENOUNCES POINTS OUT THE BILL PROVIDES GREATER INFORMATION TO POTENTIAL DONORS IT SHOULD. SHOULD ANY A DONOR DISAGREE. DEPENDS DONORS AND SHOULD I DON'T DISAGREE THAT DON'T I COULD ALWAYS REVISED A POINT TO MAKE IT WHICH IS CLEAR OR ELECT TO NOT BE A DONOR. ADDITIONALLY THE DONOR CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE NOT TO AGREE TO ANY TEMPORARY MEDICAL PROCEDURES UPON DEATH BY DELETING THAT SENTENCE IN THE DIRECTIVE ARE MAKING CLEAR AND OTHER SECTIONS. THESE CHANGES AND AB THREE TO ELEVEN TAKE A MODEST STEP ADDING CLARITY TO DONORS CHOICE AND MAKE THE USE OF ADVANCED HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVE MORE EFFECTIVE POOR OLD OR OTHER ORGAN DONATIONS. BY DOING SO THE BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE USE THESE DIRECTORS ARE PURPOSES ORGAN DONATIONS. PUBLIX THOUSANDS REMAIN ON A WAITING LIST FOR A LIFESAVING TRANSPLANT. THE ADVANCE HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE MODEL FORM HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE ITS CREATION IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. THAT NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES FROM OTHER STATES REGARDING OPTIONAL ORGAN DONATION HAVE. CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.

NINE POINT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF DONORS COME THROUGH THE DMV LICENSE RENEWAL PROCESS. AND DONATE LIFE CALIFORNIA'S CONSTANTLY LOOKING TO IMPROVE DONOR REGISTRATION RATES ACROSS THE STATE.
