MEDICAL CHALLENGES.

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:38.476 region:rollup2
UNTIL NOW HOSPITALS SCHOOLS

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.978 region:rollup2
HAVE ALWAYS WORKED TO SCHOOL

SIX A DETERMINE RULES AND SET

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:48.320 region:rollup2
POLICY AND THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:49.688 region:rollup2
RESULT IN THE MOST ACADEMICALLY.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.522 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGEOUS SOLUTIONS FOR THE

00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:51.323 region:rollup2
STUDENT OR THE MOST

00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:53.058 region:rollup2
COMPASSIONATE POLICY FOR

00:34:51.323 --> 00:34:54.726 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

00:34:53.058 --> 00:34:56.294 region:rollup2
SELECT IS HOW YOU ABOUT ONE OF

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:57.262 region:rollup2
MY STUDENTS STATED YA KNOW WHO

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:59.230 region:rollup2
CAME TO US AFTER HE WAS

00:34:57.262 --> 00:35:00.432 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA. HIS

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.801 region:rollup2
JUNIOR YEAR.

00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:04.436 region:rollup2
HE WAS FROM A LOCAL SCHOOL BUT

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:05.870 region:rollup2
IT WAS A DIFFERENT DISTRICT FROM

00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:07.572 region:rollup2
WHERE THE HOSPITAL WAS.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.840 region:rollup2
SO EVEN THOUGH.

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:11.409 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS IN THE

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.344 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL HE WAS NOT BEING SERVED

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:14.012 region:rollup2
BY HIS.

00:35:12.344 --> 00:35:16.615 region:rollup2
HOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:35:14.012 --> 00:35:18.717 region:rollup2
HE HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL SETBACKS

00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:19.985 region:rollup2
AND WAS BY REQUIRING FREQUENT

00:35:18.717 --> 00:35:21.052 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS AND WHEN HE WAS IN

00:35:19.985 --> 00:35:22.921 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL.

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:24.055 region:rollup2
HIS SCHOOL WAS NOT WILLING TO

00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:25.857 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE WORK OR TO PUT MY

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:26.558 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT STUDY BECAUSE HE WAS

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:28.493 region:rollup2
TECHNICALLY SLEEPING IN A

00:35:26.558 --> 00:35:30.095 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CITY. SO EVENTUALLY HE

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.662 region:rollup2
WAS DROPPED BY HIS HOME SCHOOL

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:31.863 region:rollup2
AND WE PICKED HIM UP IMPALA

00:35:30.662 --> 00:35:32.831 region:rollup2
TELL.

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:34.699 region:rollup2
AND EVEN WHEN HE WAS FEELING

00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:35.867 region:rollup2
BETTER AND WHEN HE WENT HOME HE

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:37.035 region:rollup2
WAS NOT ALLOWED ON TO BACK TO

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:38.069 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BECAUSE IT WAS A CLOSED

00:35:37.035 --> 00:35:39.371 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.772 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A MOTIVATED AND

00:35:39.371 --> 00:35:41.840 region:rollup2
GREGARIOUS AND.

00:35:40.772 --> 00:35:42.774 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.309 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE WITH HIS

00:35:42.774 --> 00:35:46.344 region:rollup2
FRIENDS.

00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:47.612 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE AS EDUCATORS HAVE

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:49.114 region:rollup2
AN OBLIGATION TO EDUCATE

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:51.082 region:rollup2
CHILDREN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I

00:35:49.114 --> 00:35:52.784 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO TEACH.

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:54.619 region:rollup2
EMPATHY AND COMPASSION AND WE

00:35:52.784 --> 00:35:56.988 region:rollup2
NEED TO PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH.

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:58.356 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO FOSTER THAT

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.492 region:rollup2
BELIEF THAT EDUCATION IS

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:01.426 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BUT THAT WE CARE ABOUT

00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:03.261 region:rollup2
EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS.

00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:05.463 region:rollup2
.

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:06.965 region:rollup2
SO I THINK EDIE TWENTY ONE OH

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:08.500 region:rollup2
NINE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:10.068 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.669 region:rollup2
US STRUCTURE SO THAT THEY KNOW

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:12.971 region:rollup2
WHAT STICKS BACKS WHEN ONE OF

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:14.172 region:rollup2
THEIR STUDENTS FALLS ILL OR IS

00:36:12.971 --> 00:36:15.774 region:rollup2
INJURED.

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.775 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE

00:36:15.774 --> 00:36:18.777 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PROTECT CHILDREN WHO ARE

00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:20.178 region:rollup2
IN A WHO ARE HOSPITALIZED AND WE

00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:21.279 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE THERE ADVOCATE

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.180 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DON'T HAVE

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:23.815 region:rollup2
THE TIME OR ENERGY TO BE

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.250 region:rollup2
BATTLING SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:36:23.815 --> 00:36:26.251 region:rollup2
FOR THE BASIC EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:31.790 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY STUDENT DESERVES

00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:33.858 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.293 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON.

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:36.961 region:rollup2
I'M THE PARENTS OF A CHILD

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.829 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSED WITH A RARE LIFE

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:40.165 region:rollup2
THREATENING BRING CONDITION SAYS

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:41.900 region:rollup2
ANDREW.

00:36:40.165 --> 00:36:43.468 region:rollup2
I HOPE HE WAS DIAGNOSED FIVE

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.838 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO AT AGE EIGHT IN SECOND

00:36:43.468 --> 00:36:49.174 region:rollup2
GRADE. WE STARTED THEN TO

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:51.943 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE OUR WAY THROUGH TRYING

00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:54.312 region:rollup2
TO ADD TRYING TO. ACCESS

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:55.713 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM WHILE ALSO

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:56.915 region:rollup2
PUTTING ALL OF OUR ENERGY INTO

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.516 region:rollup2
BATTLING A.

00:36:56.915 --> 00:36:59.951 region:rollup2
LIFE THREATENING.

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:01.419 region:rollup2
ILLNESS MY SON HAS RECEIVED

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:02.887 region:rollup2
HOME HOSPITAL SERVICES TWO

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:03.988 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TIMES WE'VE DONE

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.457 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT STUDY WE'VE DONE

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:07.826 region:rollup2
MODIFY DAY WE'VE DONE PRETTY

00:37:05.457 --> 00:37:09.727 region:rollup2
MUCH ALL OF THE THINGS OVER THIS

00:37:07.826 --> 00:37:11.963 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR JOURNEY. I'M AS

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:14.265 region:rollup2
WE HOPEFULLY WAIT FOR MY SON TO

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:15.400 region:rollup2
BECOME AN ABM FREE.

00:37:14.265 --> 00:37:16.701 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.769 region:rollup2
CAN MEAN MADE FOR SCHOOL AGE

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:19.704 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO ARE BATTLING

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:21.506 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ILLNESSES CHILDREN AND

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:22.807 region:rollup2
FAMILIES ARE USING ALL OF THEIR

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:24.476 region:rollup2
STRENGTH TO FIGHT THESE

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:26.010 region:rollup2
ILLNESSES. AND SHOULDN'T BE

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:27.445 region:rollup2
BURDENED WITH WHAT I SEE IS

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.780 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRATIC FEELINGS OF A

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:30.615 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT WE'VE HAD A

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.882 region:rollup2
MEANT SUPPORT FROM OUR SCHOOL

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.851 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:34.052 region:rollup2
.

00:37:32.851 --> 00:37:35.353 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE I

00:37:34.052 --> 00:37:38.123 region:rollup2
WAS A VOLUNTEER BUT WHAT I

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:39.657 region:rollup2
WASN'T WHAT IF I COULDN'T CALL

00:37:38.123 --> 00:37:41.893 region:rollup2
AND GET A RESPONSE FROM THE

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:43.161 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT. THAT MATTERS IT

00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:44.329 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T MATTER THAT I

00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:46.131 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERED A LOT IN NEW THE

00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:47.499 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT IN ORDER TO GET

00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:49.134 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOR MY CHILD NEED.

00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:50.802 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO BETTER ON A LOT OF

00:37:49.134 --> 00:37:51.236 region:rollup2
FRONTS.

00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:52.570 region:rollup2
I.

00:37:51.236 --> 00:37:54.339 region:rollup2
CAN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.340 region:rollup2
HEARTBREAK.

00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:57.575 region:rollup2
THE HEARTBREAK IT IS TO GET A

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:59.444 region:rollup2
TRUANCY NOTICE FOR YOUR CHILD

00:37:57.575 --> 00:38:01.412 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU WANT NOTHING MORE FOR

00:37:59.444 --> 00:38:04.482 region:rollup2

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:05.884 region:rollup2
TIME. LIKE A REGULAR KID PARENTS

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:08.353 region:rollup2
OF OF.

00:38:05.884 --> 00:38:09.721 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS ILLNESSES

00:38:08.353 --> 00:38:11.523 region:rollup2
OFTEN USE SCHOOL AS THE

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:12.590 region:rollup2
BAROMETER TO GET BACK TO NORMAL

00:38:11.523 --> 00:38:13.758 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR SCHOOL

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.292 region:rollup2
YOUR CHILD SUPPOSED TO BE

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.193 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN

00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:17.595 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

00:38:15.193 --> 00:38:20.565 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ONE OF.

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:21.399 region:rollup2
THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS

00:38:20.565 --> 00:38:24.302 region:rollup2
TO.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:25.570 region:rollup2
TRY TO DO BECAUSE THEY. IF YOU

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.137 region:rollup2
HAVE A SERIOUSLY ILL CHILD THEY

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.206 region:rollup2
DO NEED SPECIAL HELP AND AND

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:29.774 region:rollup2
AND.

00:38:28.206 --> 00:38:31.843 region:rollup2
.

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:32.811 region:rollup2
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE

00:38:31.843 --> 00:38:34.579 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES ARE THE HOSPITAL'S

00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:35.747 region:rollup2
INTO CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL IF THERE

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:36.447 region:rollup2
BE IN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS.

00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:38.483 region:rollup2
AND.

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:39.517 region:rollup2
WHEN I GET THE TRUANCY NOTICE

00:38:38.483 --> 00:38:41.419 region:rollup2
IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART I SHOULD

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:42.821 region:rollup2
LAUGH BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:44.055 region:rollup2
COMICAL BECAUSE OF MY CREATE LET

00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:45.957 region:rollup2
ME GO BEFORE THE TURN SUPPORT

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:46.925 region:rollup2
BUT. THAT'S ALL ROLLING ALL OUT

00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:49.060 region:rollup2
FOR THEM.

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:50.461 region:rollup2
BUT I CRIED BECAUSE YOU WANT

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.796 region:rollup2
NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR KID TO BE

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:53.398 region:rollup2
IN SCHOOL AND THE LANGUAGE IN

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:54.866 region:rollup2
THOSE NOTICES ARE SUCH THAT THEY

00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:56.234 region:rollup2
SAY.

00:38:54.866 --> 00:38:57.735 region:rollup2
WHO WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU

00:38:56.234 --> 00:38:59.737 region:rollup2

THAT YOUR CHILD ATTEND EVERYDAY?

YEAH I KNOW I WISH THAT WERE

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:04.709 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.678 region:rollup2
SO I FEEL LIKE.

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:08.546 region:rollup2
THIS IS A REALLY CRITICALLY

00:39:06.678 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN HELPING TO MEET

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:11.316 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.451 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY ILL CHILDREN.

00:39:11.316 --> 00:39:14.652 region:rollup2
IT IS MAKES A FEW MINOR CHANGES

ETHNIC GROUP WHETHER IT'S.

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:20.604 region:rollup2
LATINO I THINK THE EXAMPLE USES

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:21.571 region:rollup2
NATIVE AMERICAN THAT THAT FALLS.

00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:22.205 region:rollup2
BELOW THE MEDIAN THAT NAY WOOD

THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:28.045 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT THAT

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:29.613 region:rollup2
SUBGROUP.

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:31.715 region:rollup2
THERE THERE ISN'T IT ANY ISSUE

00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:33.050 region:rollup2
WITH THE EP I POPULATION IN IN

00:57:31.715 --> 00:57:34.751 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA I KNOW SCHOOLS AS IN

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:36.553 region:rollup2

KNOW THE TRADITIONALLY IF YOU

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:43.160 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE API SCORES VERY

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:45.128 region:rollup2
STRONG YOU LOOK AT THE SUBGROUPS

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.697 region:rollup2
OF THAT SUBGROUP SO HE JUST

00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:48.732 region:rollup2
AGGREGATE. THE COMMUNITY FOR

00:57:46.697 --> 00:57:50.567 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE SOUTHEAST ASIAN AMONG

00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:52.602 region:rollup2
THE AND THE.

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:54.104 region:rollup2
SOUTH LAOTIAN COMMUNITY.

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:55.939 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME OF THE HIGH

00:57:54.104 --> 00:57:57.874 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION SCHOOLS. ARE

00:57:55.939 --> 00:58:00.477 region:rollup2
AREN'T THE SAME AS ASIAN AS A

00:57:57.874 --> 00:58:02.713 region:rollup2
WHOLE SIGH I WANNA ASK A DOCTOR

00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:05.082 region:rollup2
WEBER. IF A AS POLICY GOES

00:58:02.713 --> 00:58:06.049 region:rollup2
FORWARD WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT

00:58:05.082 --> 00:58:06.984 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:08.485 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:09.953 region:rollup2
THE GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:11.488 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT ALL CAN BENEFIT

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:12.889 region:rollup2
FROM THE NOTION THAT YOU'RE

00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:14.458 region:rollup2
PUTTING FOR HERE WHICH IS WE

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:16.226 region:rollup2
SHOULD LEAVE ANY. A SUBGROUP

00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:19.997 region:rollup2
BEHIND WITH OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:20.564 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:23.700 region:rollup2
ALL YOUR ANSWER THAT OKAY Y.

00:58:20.564 --> 00:58:25.068 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.003 region:rollup2
YOU IS KIND OF RHETORICAL BUT.

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:28.739 region:rollup2
.

00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:30.774 region:rollup2
SURE THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT THE

00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:31.375 region:rollup2
LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP.

00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:33.110 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT AFRICAN

00:58:31.375 --> 00:58:34.277 region:rollup2
AMERICANS.

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:36.079 region:rollup2
WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE LOWEST

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:37.948 region:rollup2
PERFORMING SUBGROUP SHOULD GET

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:38.482 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IF

00:58:37.948 --> 00:58:40.751 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T FALL INTO THE

00:58:38.482 --> 00:58:41.752 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES? WHEN WE BEGAN LCF

00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:43.253 region:rollup2
AFTER MOST OF YOU WEREN'T HERE

00:58:41.752 --> 00:58:44.955 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME I WAS HERE IN TWENTY

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:46.456 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN WHEN WHEN THE GOVERNOR

00:58:44.955 --> 00:58:47.624 region:rollup2
WAS PUSHING THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:49.159 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORM IT. WE HEAR YOU

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:50.560 region:rollup2
HAVE NO YOU ARE HERE OKAY I WAS

00:58:49.159 --> 00:58:52.362 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ONE HERE.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.231 region:rollup2
THAT WAS AT THAT TIME A PART OF

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:55.298 region:rollup2
THE EFFORTS AND THE EFFORT WAS

00:58:54.231 --> 00:58:57.167 region:rollup2
TO REALLY CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:59.069 region:rollup2
GAP. AND WE THOUGHT BY ADDING

00:58:57.167 --> 00:59:00.070 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF THAT WOULD

00:58:59.069 --> 00:59:01.571 region:rollup2
COVER EVERYONE.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.739 region:rollup2
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE IF WE

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:04.307 region:rollup2
LEFT TO THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:07.144 region:rollup2
READS THE REGIONAL LANGUAGES NOT

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:07.711 region:rollup2
BI LINGUAL A SECOND LANGUAGE

00:59:07.144 --> 00:59:08.578 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION IT WAS ENGLISH

00:59:07.711 --> 00:59:09.579 region:rollup2
PROFICIENCY.

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:11.048 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD HAVE COVERED MORE

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:12.783 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE

00:59:11.048 --> 00:59:14.384 region:rollup2
OF BECOME PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH

00:59:12.783 --> 00:59:15.252 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WAS TAKEN OUT AND SO AS

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:16.186 region:rollup2
A RESULT WE ENDED UP WITH THESE

00:59:15.252 --> 00:59:18.088 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES.

00:59:16.186 --> 00:59:19.289 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DISCOVERED NOW THAT IF

00:59:18.088 --> 00:59:21.658 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THOSE THREE

00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:22.993 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES OF INCOME OF FOSTER

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:24.194 region:rollup2
KIDS AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:59:22.993 --> 00:59:25.829 region:rollup2
LEARNERS THAT WOULD HAVE A GOOD

00:59:24.194 --> 00:59:28.365 region:rollup2
NUMBER SUB GROUP IT IS

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:29.699 region:rollup2
PERSISTENTLY AT THE BOTTOM. AND

00:59:28.365 --> 00:59:30.700 region:rollup2
THAT DD THAT ARE NOT POOR THAT

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.501 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.803 region:rollup2
LEARNERS AND SO THEREFORE AND

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:34.071 region:rollup2
NOT IN FOSTER CARE SO THEREFORE

00:59:32.803 --> 00:59:35.072 region:rollup2
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING ELSE

00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:36.640 region:rollup2
AT WORK HERE.

00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:38.175 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A PERSISTENTLY LOW

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.409 region:rollup2
CATEGORY THAT IS THERE THAT WE

00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:40.911 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:42.145 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE WE WILL NEVER CLOSE

00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:43.680 region:rollup2
THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IF WE'D KNOW

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:45.449 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ON THE BOTTOM. SO IN A

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.216 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT BECOMES THE LOWEST

00:59:45.449 --> 00:59:48.418 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING GROUP THAT HAS THIS

00:59:46.216 --> 00:59:49.252 region:rollup2
GAP WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:51.288 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IT'S LOOKING AT

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:52.656 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICANS OUR GOAL WAS

00:59:51.288 --> 00:59:55.392 region:rollup2
NEVER TO BE ON THE BOTTOM ALWAYS

00:59:52.656 --> 00:59:56.893 region:rollup2
TO BE ON THE TOP. SO AS WE MOVE

00:59:55.392 --> 00:59:58.662 region:rollup2
UP THERE MAY BE OTHER GROUPS TO

00:59:56.893 --> 01:00:00.497 region:rollup2
COME INTO EXISTENCE.

00:59:58.662 --> 01:00:02.432 region:rollup2
SOME OF YOU PROBABLY WERE HERE

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:04.568 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TRY TO DO SOME THINGS

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:06.803 region:rollup2
WITH THE API COMMUNITY AND I WAS

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:09.906 region:rollup2
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MY COLLEAGUE

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:11.808 region:rollup2
MISTER BONTA FOR THE OPEN AREA.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:14.644 region:rollup2
WHEN HE WANTED TO DESEGREGATE

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:16.580 region:rollup2
THE POPULATIONS IN IN IN THE API

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:19.416 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. AND.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:21.585 region:rollup2
AND I WAS VERY UNFAVORABLE

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:23.386 region:rollup2
SPOKE IN FAVOR OF IT VOTED IN

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:25.155 region:rollup2
FAVOR BECAUSE I'VE DONE THAT

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:28.058 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:29.860 region:rollup2
IN SAN DIEGO AND WE HAD LOTS OF

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:33.029 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE API COMMUNITY IN

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:35.665 region:rollup2
LUMPING THEM ALL TOGETHER. JULIE

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:37.567 region:rollup2
DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:39.769 region:rollup2
ARE STRUGGLING AND.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:41.605 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NUMBERS

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:44.641 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK LIKE MATTHEW

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:45.942 region:rollup2
DISAGGREGATED IT BUT IT MAY SHOW

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:49.646 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THEY ARE STILL

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:52.616 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT LIKE THE

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:54.484 region:rollup2
OTHER API. AND I THINK MOST OF

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:55.051 region:rollup2
US VOTED FOR BOTH WHATEVER

01:00:54.484 --> 01:01:01.024 region:rollup2
HAPPENED VIA API THAT DIDN'T

01:00:55.051 --> 01:01:02.792 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE PROBLEMS

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:03.660 region:rollup2
OF THIS OBVIOUSLY LCF F. SHOULD

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:05.896 region:rollup2
BE A LIVING DOCUMENT THE

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.731 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY LOOK AT ITSELF

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:09.533 region:rollup2
EVALUATES ITSELF AND THIS POINT.

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.834 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST ACHIEVING GROUP THAT

01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF IN TERMS OF

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:13.803 region:rollup2
OUR BREAK OUT IS AFRICAN

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:15.238 region:rollup2
AMERICAN BUT IT COULD BE SOMEONE

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:17.807 region:rollup2
ELSE AT THINK AS. AS THE

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:19.009 region:rollup2
MISFORTUNE MENTIONED EARLIER IT

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:20.477 region:rollup2
COULD BE ANOTHER GROUP IN

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:22.279 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS AS WE

01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:24.414 region:rollup2
PROGRESS INTO THE KINDS OF

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:24.848 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. OUR

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:25.148 region:rollup2
GOAL IS TO CLOSE THE

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:25.715 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT.

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.816 region:rollup2
AND THAT AND AND FACING THIS

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.684 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT'S HERE AND MAKING

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:29.653 region:rollup2
THIS RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.554 region:rollup2
BILL IS THE FIRST STEP OF US

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.255 region:rollup2

JUSTICE ABOUT EVERY GROUP WE

CHILDREN.

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:20.837 region:rollup2
I'VE LEARN MORE ABOUT TEACHERS

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:21.738 region:rollup2
AND STUDENTS AND I CAN IMAGINE

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:23.373 region:rollup2
IN THIS ROLE.

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:24.841 region:rollup2

SCHOOL IS WITH THEIR TEACHER.

01:07:37.854 --> 01:07:40.924 region:rollup2
THIS IS USUALLY TRUE BUT AS THE

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:43.026 region:rollup2
TRUSTEE I'VE LEARNED THAT IN

01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:44.060 region:rollup2
SOME INSTANCES IT IS NOT.

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:45.361 region:rollup2
IT'S UNSAFE WHEN A TEACHER AND

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.529 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:48.531 region:rollup2
SEXUALLY HARASSES STUDENTS ARE

CHILDREN.

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:51.401 region:rollup2
THE HARASSMENT IMPAIRS THE

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:53.036 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP DISRUPTS THE

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:54.037 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL PROCESS

01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:55.838 region:rollup2
AND TEACHERS ARE KIDS THAT IT'S

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:57.140 region:rollup2
OKAY TO BE THREATENED.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.207 region:rollup2
THIS IS A LESSON THAT WILL BE

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:00.209 region:rollup2
IMPRINTED ON THEM FOR THE REST

01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:01.077 region:rollup2

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.478 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN BE VERY

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:04.147 region:rollup2
SUBTLE.

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:04.747 region:rollup2
SO MUCH THE KIDS MIGHT QUESTION

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:06.449 region:rollup2

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:08.985 region:rollup2
IN FACT IN RECENT HEADLINES

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:10.853 region:rollup2

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:14.524 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IN COMING FORWARD.

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:15.625 region:rollup2
AND WHEN A STUDENT FEELS

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:17.727 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE THEY DON'T ALWAYS

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:18.861 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:20.496 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.997 region:rollup2

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:24.400 region:rollup2

STUDENTS HAVE THE TIME TO BE

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.908 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BOND WITH THEIR CHILDREN

01:17:56.472 --> 01:18:00.342 region:rollup2

HAVE SHOWN THAT PREGNANCY CAN

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:04.647 region:rollup2
MOTIVATE YOUNG PARENTS TO DO

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:06.815 region:rollup2

THEY DROPPED OUT ALTOGETHER

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:21.197 region:rollup2

THE NEW RESPONSIBILITY IS A

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:24.567 region:rollup2
PARENTING IN SCHOOL. SO WE ARE

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:26.368 region:rollup2
ESTIMATING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:27.670 region:rollup2

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.107 region:rollup2
INTERFERENCE TURNING STUDENTS

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:33.676 region:rollup2
DON'T RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THAT

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:35.945 region:rollup2
ANY PARENT WOULD REGARDLESS OF

AGE THEY'LL HAVE AN ECONOMIC

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:38.714 region:rollup2
UPHILL BATTLE.

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.315 region:rollup2
WITH THEY WILL EARN ELEVEN

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.849 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS A YEAR

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:41.450 region:rollup2
THAN THEIR STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.585 region:rollup2
FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND TWENTY

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.052 region:rollup2
THOUSAND LAST YEAR THAN THOSE

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:44.053 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:45.254 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.789 region:rollup2
AND THIS WILL ACTUALLY IMPACT

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:47.389 region:rollup2
THEIR IMMUNE NOT ONLY PACKED

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:48.290 region:rollup2
THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS BUT IT

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.657 region:rollup2
WILL IMPACT THE NEEDS OF THEIR

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.992 region:rollup2
YOUNG CHILDREN.

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.626 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO HAVE.

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:51.527 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO HAVE EARLY BONDING

01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:52.461 region:rollup2
TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS EXHIBIT

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:54.196 region:rollup2
BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES LIKE

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:55.898 region:rollup2
BETTER PROBLEM SOLVING COPING IN

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:57.366 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING SKILLS AND THESE

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:59.101 region:rollup2
ARE THE FUTURE OF STUDENTS OF

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:00.369 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:01.770 region:rollup2
SO WITH MY YEARS OF WORKING TO

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:03.005 region:rollup2
SUPPORT YOUNG WOMEN I'VE HAD THE

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:05.708 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THE

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:07.243 region:rollup2
CAL STATE PROGRAM. IN THROUGH

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:08.844 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM THE YOUNG PARENTS

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:10.045 region:rollup2
HAD VITAL RESOURCES THEY NEED

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.113 region:rollup2
IT'S A BOND AND CARE FOR SICK

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:12.915 region:rollup2
CHILDREN THEY COMPLETED HIGH

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:15.718 region:rollup2

ORIGINAL SCHOOL REGULAR SCHOOL.

01:19:15.718 --> 01:19:19.455 region:rollup2
SO THIS PROGRAM SIDE GRADUATION

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:20.522 region:rollup2
RATES HIGHER THAN THAT OF SOME

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.291 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS.

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:23.959 region:rollup2

DECREASED FROM HUNDRED THIRTY

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.771 region:rollup2
SEVEN SO ONLY FIFTY TWO.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:37.206 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:39.008 region:rollup2

IN THE SCHOOL BUSES SAFE FLIGHT.

01:26:59.448 --> 01:27:02.484 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING AT THE ITEMS

01:27:00.749 --> 01:27:03.985 region:rollup2
STUDY FROM NH TSA AND THAT THE

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:04.886 region:rollup2

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:06.154 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN PRETTY HARD

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.455 region:rollup2
TO PROVE THAT THERE ACTUALLY ARE

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:09.291 region:rollup2
INCREASED.

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:10.192 region:rollup2
SAFETY BENEFITS FROM HAVING AS

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:10.859 region:rollup2
YEAH SEAT BELTS IN SCHOOL BUSES

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:11.059 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S EVEN SOME SUGGESTION

01:27:10.859 --> 01:27:12.227 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.861 region:rollup2
THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH DOING

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.729 region:rollup2
SO MIGHT FOR SOME DISTRICTS TO

01:27:12.861 --> 01:27:14.730 region:rollup2
SCALE BACK THEIR SCHOOL BUS

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:16.098 region:rollup2

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:20.535 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SEATBELT INVOLVED.

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.436 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND I

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.038 region:rollup2

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:24.306 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THE HABIT OF WEARING

01:27:23.038 --> 01:27:26.908 region:rollup2

01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:27.876 region:rollup2
A SAFETY BOOST IN THE SCHOOL

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:28.710 region:rollup2

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:30.479 region:rollup2
SPECULATE AND I DON'T KNOW IF

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:30.946 region:rollup2
THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS THAT EFFECT

01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:32.647 region:rollup2
SO.

INTUITIVELY SENSIBLE YEAH SCHOOL

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:38.120 region:rollup2
BUSES SHOULD HAVE SEAT BELTS BUT

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:39.154 region:rollup2
DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE. AYE

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.922 region:rollup2
THE DEBT DATA BEHIND IT WE MIGHT

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:41.923 region:rollup2

HOWEVER I BELIEVE THE CHAIR

01:52:32.746 --> 01:52:38.685 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE IS TO MOVE

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:39.286 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUSLY.

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:49.062 region:rollup2
BOTH I KATE COLLINS FROM LAUSD

CORD.

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:50.430 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING

01:52:49.896 --> 01:52:54.701 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S LIKE A COURTROOM

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:57.070 region:rollup2
SETTING.

01:52:54.701 --> 01:53:01.108 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO. TREAT THE SICK JUST

01:52:57.070 --> 01:53:03.744 region:rollup2
FEET AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO

THEY'VE TO TESTIFY AGAINST THEM.

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:07.714 region:rollup2
AND AT THIS POINT THEY'VE

01:53:07.047 --> 01:53:09.016 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN INTERROGATED BY A

01:53:07.714 --> 01:53:10.450 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

01:53:09.016 --> 01:53:11.952 region:rollup2

01:53:11.952 --> 01:53:14.755 region:rollup2

DISTRICT ATTORNEY INVESTIGATION.

01:53:14.755 --> 01:53:16.923 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE START THIS PROCESS

01:53:16.289 --> 01:53:18.558 region:rollup2
WHERE PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS GET

01:53:16.923 --> 01:53:20.093 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:21.895 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE

01:53:20.093 --> 01:53:23.997 region:rollup2
YEARS IS REALLY HARD TO TAKE.

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:24.531 region:rollup2
SOME STUDENTS ARE SO FEARFUL BY

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:25.699 region:rollup2
THE TIME THEY GET TO THIS

01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:30.103 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:53:25.699 --> 01:53:32.272 region:rollup2
I HAD TO LEAVE THE STATE.

SCARED.

01:53:44.785 --> 01:53:45.919 region:rollup2
AND.

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:50.290 region:rollup2
.

01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:52.259 region:rollup2
IF.

01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:53.060 region:rollup2
SO WE DO THIS FOR YEARS BUT WHAT

01:53:52.259 --> 01:53:56.096 region:rollup2
REALLY STRUCK ME WAS A CASE

01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:57.864 region:rollup2
ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND IT WASN'T

01:53:56.096 --> 01:53:58.365 region:rollup2
EVEN THE MOST EGREGIOUS.

01:53:57.864 --> 01:54:00.400 region:rollup2
IT WAS CASE INVOLVED AN

01:53:58.365 --> 01:54:00.967 region:rollup2
EDUCATOR.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.035 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD THROW THINGS AT A

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:02.502 region:rollup2
STUDENT?

01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:03.970 region:rollup2
BUT THE STATE WAS VERY

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:05.405 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE.

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:06.840 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENT AND

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:09.876 region:rollup2
DUMB.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:10.610 region:rollup2
HE CAME AND HE SHOWED UP. AND

01:54:09.876 --> 01:54:11.244 region:rollup2
HE'D BEEN CONSISTENT ALL

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:13.714 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS.

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:14.548 region:rollup2
BUT ONCE HE WAS INTERROGATED BY.

01:54:13.714 --> 01:54:16.383 region:rollup2
PRETTY AGGRESSIVE ATTORNEYS ON

01:54:14.548 --> 01:54:18.118 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE.

01:54:16.383 --> 01:54:19.619 region:rollup2
HE JUST FELL PART.

01:54:18.118 --> 01:54:21.455 region:rollup2
HE STARTED SPINNING AROUND IN

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:22.022 region:rollup2
HIS CHAIR AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:54:21.455 --> 01:54:22.589 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS BEEN

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:23.990 region:rollup2
SAYING CONSISTENTLY OVER THE

01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:25.859 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:27.260 region:rollup2
HE WASN'T MAKING THINGS UP.

01:54:25.859 --> 01:54:28.428 region:rollup2
SO I WENT DOWN TO OUR MENTAL

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.730 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. AND I SAID

01:54:28.428 --> 01:54:30.664 region:rollup2

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING HOWEVER

01:55:12.973 --> 01:55:16.843 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE CHILD'S ALLEGATIONS

01:55:14.975 --> 01:55:18.044 region:rollup2
ARE LITIGATED AND ADMINISTRATIVE

01:55:16.843 --> 01:55:19.880 region:rollup2

THIS FROM EXPERIENCE I WOULD

01:55:51.845 --> 01:55:55.515 region:rollup2
SUBMIT TO YOU ALL THAT THIS

01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:57.017 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENCY IS DUE TO THE LACK

01:55:55.515 --> 01:55:59.019 region:rollup2
OF STATUTORY GUIDELINES

01:55:57.017 --> 01:56:01.154 region:rollup2

EVERY OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING

01:56:02.823 --> 01:56:05.225 region:rollup2
THAT DOES INVOLVE A MINOR

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:06.359 region:rollup2
WITNESS.

01:56:05.225 --> 01:56:08.128 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR IS

THREE DIFFERENT WAYS FIRST.

01:56:14.835 --> 01:56:17.704 region:rollup2
UNDER AGREE JUST ONLY PROCEDURES

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:19.272 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:20.173 region:rollup2
DISCOVERY PROCESS WHICH IS

01:56:19.272 --> 01:56:21.641 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOVERNED BY THE

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:23.243 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CODE IT'S NOT

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:24.878 region:rollup2
GOVERNED BY THE EDUCATION CODE.

01:56:23.243 --> 01:56:26.079 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO INITIAL DISCLOSURES

01:56:24.878 --> 01:56:27.814 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY A DEMAND FOR

01:56:26.079 --> 01:56:29.182 region:rollup2
DISCOVERY AND THAT DEMAND

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:29.716 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY INCLUDE THE DEMAND FOR

CERTAIN LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:56:38.158 --> 01:56:41.027 region:rollup2
AND SO A SUBPOENA IS BY FAR THE

01:56:39.693 --> 01:56:43.296 region:rollup2
MOST EFFICIENT PROCESS TO

01:56:41.027 --> 01:56:45.165 region:rollup2
SATISFY THE LEGAL REQUIREMENT.

01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:46.600 region:rollup2

BUT THAT KYLE COULD CONTINUE

02:18:55.194 --> 02:18:58.330 region:rollup2

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.897 region:rollup2

THAT MONEY DOESN'T SOLVE ALL

02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:46.590 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS

02:37:43.954 --> 02:37:47.391 region:rollup2

THROUGH CLASS SIZE REDUCTION.

02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:04.241 region:rollup2
IN MY US DID NOT AND I BELIEVE

02:38:03.007 --> 02:38:05.743 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN IMPACT EVEN TODAY IN

02:38:04.241 --> 02:38:08.179 region:rollup2
THEIR PERFORMANCE.

02:38:05.743 --> 02:38:10.047 region:rollup2
I I REALLY TRULY BELIEVE THAT

02:38:08.179 --> 02:38:12.249 region:rollup2
AND THE IN AND AND AND THAT HAS

02:38:10.047 --> 02:38:13.117 region:rollup2
IMPACTED THEIR ACADEMIC ABILITY

02:38:12.249 --> 02:38:14.819 region:rollup2
DAY.

02:38:13.117 --> 02:38:15.853 region:rollup2
IT BUT I ALSO WANT MY KIDS TO

02:38:14.819 --> 02:38:17.555 region:rollup2
FIELD TRIPS.

02:38:15.853 --> 02:38:19.457 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT THEM TO MORE MUSIC

02:38:17.555 --> 02:38:21.859 region:rollup2
CLASSES. AYE I WANT THEM TO HAVE

02:38:19.457 --> 02:38:23.828 region:rollup2
AN ENRICHING EXPERIENCE IT ISN'T

02:38:21.859 --> 02:38:25.463 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ABOUT ACHIEVEMENT BUT ITS

02:38:23.828 --> 02:38:26.931 region:rollup2
FULFILLMENT WHICH LEADS TO

02:38:25.463 --> 02:38:28.199 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT OFTEN I THINK.

02:38:26.931 --> 02:38:30.001 region:rollup2
AND EIGHT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE

02:38:28.199 --> 02:38:31.669 region:rollup2
QUANTITATIVE BUT IT'S OFTEN THE

02:38:30.001 --> 02:38:33.004 region:rollup2
QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCE

02:38:31.669 --> 02:38:34.505 region:rollup2
IN A CHILD'S SCHOOL THAT MAKES

02:38:33.004 --> 02:38:35.673 region:rollup2
THEM WANT TO COME BACK THAT

02:38:34.505 --> 02:38:37.508 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THAT HELP SINCE

02:38:35.673 --> 02:38:39.377 region:rollup2
SEAT AS A HUMAN BEING.

02:38:37.508 --> 02:38:41.579 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T ALL ABOUT THAT TEST

02:38:39.377 --> 02:38:44.315 region:rollup2
SCORES PART OF THAT FOR SURE BUT

02:38:41.579 --> 02:38:45.883 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THAT.

02:38:44.315 --> 02:38:47.585 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WAS

02:38:45.883 --> 02:38:49.787 region:rollup2
UNAWARE OF THE BREADTH OF YOUR

02:38:47.585 --> 02:38:52.790 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE. AND I AM MORE I HAVE

02:38:49.787 --> 02:38:54.024 region:rollup2
MORE COMING.

02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:55.826 region:rollup2
BUT I AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T

02:38:54.024 --> 02:38:56.260 region:rollup2
DISAGREE WITH WITH WITH A LOT OF

02:38:55.826 --> 02:38:58.062 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:59.130 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE SPEND THIRTY BILLION

02:38:58.062 --> 02:39:00.998 region:rollup2
DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR AND BY THE

02:38:59.130 --> 02:39:02.967 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE MEASURE.

02:39:00.998 --> 02:39:04.235 region:rollup2
THE NEEDLE HASN'T MOVED I THINK

02:39:02.967 --> 02:39:06.270 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY IT

02:39:04.235 --> 02:39:07.571 region:rollup2
WAS PREDICTED OVER TEN YEARS AGO

02:39:06.270 --> 02:39:09.240 region:rollup2
IN THIS STUDY THAT JUST PUTTING

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:09.940 region:rollup2
IN MORE MONEY. WITHOUT SYSTEMIC

02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:11.609 region:rollup2
REFORM.

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:12.910 region:rollup2
ISN'T GONNA LEAD TO ANY

02:39:11.609 --> 02:39:14.044 region:rollup2
PROGRESS AND IT'S ESPECIALLY I

02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:15.780 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:39:14.044 --> 02:39:17.181 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGING WHEN WE SEE GREAT

02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:18.983 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT

02:39:17.181 --> 02:39:20.251 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DOING THINGS

02:39:18.983 --> 02:39:21.018 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND GETTING GREAT RESULTS.

02:39:20.251 --> 02:39:22.186 region:rollup2
AND WAS THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS

02:39:21.018 --> 02:39:24.021 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THAT

02:39:22.186 --> 02:39:25.656 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE SYSTEMIC REFORMS THAT

02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:26.590 region:rollup2
HAVE LIFTED ALL STUDENTS.

02:39:25.656 --> 02:39:28.559 region:rollup2
IN MEANINGFUL WAYS AND

02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:29.360 region:rollup2
BIOMETRICS THAT MISTER O'DONNELL

02:39:28.559 --> 02:39:31.362 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO.

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:31.695 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GONNA

02:39:31.362 --> 02:39:34.165 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:39:31.695 --> 02:39:36.634 region:rollup2
LEGISLATE ASPIRATION ONLY.

02:39:34.165 --> 02:39:38.202 region:rollup2
THAT'S FINE BUT THE SUBSTANCE

02:39:36.634 --> 02:39:38.869 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ASPIRATION SHOULD BE

02:39:38.202 --> 02:39:41.238 region:rollup2
STUDENT.

02:39:38.869 --> 02:39:42.440 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT IN LIFE SUCCESS NOT

02:39:41.238 --> 02:39:44.175 region:rollup2
JUST FUNDING AND FORGET IT YOU

02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:45.076 region:rollup2
KNOW MARK MARK OUT HOW DO WE GET

02:39:44.175 --> 02:39:45.476 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE

02:39:45.076 --> 02:39:47.378 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

02:39:45.476 --> 02:39:48.546 region:rollup2
SURE INCREASE FUNDING MIGHT BE

02:39:47.378 --> 02:39:51.882 region:rollup2
A PART OF THAT.

02:39:48.546 --> 02:39:53.217 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT THE END GOAL AND

02:39:51.882 --> 02:39:54.485 region:rollup2
THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:39:53.217 --> 02:39:55.553 region:rollup2
HOW INCREASINGLY A LOT OF THE

02:39:54.485 --> 02:39:56.554 region:rollup2
MONEY ISN'T GOING TOWARD THE

02:39:55.553 --> 02:39:57.688 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM WE HAVE DISTRICTS

02:39:56.554 --> 02:39:59.090 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HAVING TO CUT BACK ON

02:39:57.688 --> 02:40:00.091 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE TEACHER SALARIES

02:39:59.090 --> 02:40:01.992 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SUCH A BIG PART OF THEIR

02:40:00.091 --> 02:40:04.495 region:rollup2
BUDGET. IS A POST RETIREMENT.

02:40:01.992 --> 02:40:06.964 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS AND WE'RE NOT DOING

02:40:04.495 --> 02:40:10.101 region:rollup2
A LOT AT TO ADDRESS THAT SO.

02:40:06.964 --> 02:40:11.769 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I.

02:40:10.101 --> 02:40:13.237 region:rollup2
WHEN WE. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE'RE

02:40:11.769 --> 02:40:14.138 region:rollup2
GOING AS A STATE. THIS

02:40:13.237 --> 02:40:15.606 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WHAT THE RIGHT

02:40:14.138 --> 02:40:16.540 region:rollup2
FUNDING LEVEL SHOULD BE

02:40:15.606 --> 02:40:17.808 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY NEED TO BE PART OF

02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:19.143 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION BUT IT'S

02:40:17.808 --> 02:40:20.211 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SUPPORT

02:40:19.143 --> 02:40:21.879 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TODAY WHEN I

02:40:20.211 --> 02:40:22.880 region:rollup2
SEE. THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

02:40:21.879 --> 02:40:24.415 region:rollup2
THINGS WE NEED TO DO

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:26.817 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY BEING NEGLECTED BY

02:40:24.415 --> 02:40:27.284 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE SO I THANK YOU

02:40:26.817 --> 02:40:28.085 region:rollup2
FOR BRING THIS CORDON

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:29.520 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTED COMPENSATE.

02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:30.020 region:rollup2
THANK YOU NAY OBSERVED YOU TO

02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:31.388 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE MISTER

02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:33.123 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES I THINK WE SURE YOU

02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:34.191 region:rollup2
SEE SUPPORTING AN INCREASE IN

02:40:33.123 --> 02:40:35.960 region:rollup2
FUNDING YES THAT'S PART OF IT I

02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:37.828 region:rollup2
ALSO THINK. WHAT HE'S SAYING

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:39.130 region:rollup2
HERE'S LOCAL CONTROL IS BEST I

02:40:37.828 --> 02:40:40.898 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:40:39.130 --> 02:40:42.466 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD IN THE FOUR YEARS?

02:40:40.898 --> 02:40:43.300 region:rollup2
AND LET'S ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:40:42.466 --> 02:40:44.635 region:rollup2
GOING BACK.

02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:46.704 region:rollup2
I DURING THE RECEPTION ARE

02:40:44.635 --> 02:40:47.738 region:rollup2
RECESSION HOW MUCH DO WE GET IN

02:40:46.704 --> 02:40:50.040 region:rollup2
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:40:47.738 --> 02:40:51.342 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FUNDING WENT WAY DOWN.

02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:52.309 region:rollup2
WERE NOW COMING BACK IN JUST

02:40:51.342 --> 02:40:54.178 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:56.614 region:rollup2
PURCHASING POWER SOURCE STILL

02:40:54.178 --> 02:41:00.150 region:rollup2
DOWN. AND TO EDUCATE KIDS IT

02:40:56.614 --> 02:41:02.052 region:rollup2
TAKES MONEY. IT TAKES STAFF IT

02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:03.654 region:rollup2
TAKES FACILITIES IT TAKES

02:41:02.052 --> 02:41:06.157 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS PURSE.

02:41:03.654 --> 02:41:07.958 region:rollup2
SO IT IS NOT A CHEAP VENTURE.

02:41:06.157 --> 02:41:10.027 region:rollup2
AND AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:41:07.958 --> 02:41:11.195 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. I JUST THINK MY OWN

02:41:10.027 --> 02:41:12.396 region:rollup2
KIDS AND AND YOU'LL YOU'LL GET

02:41:11.195 --> 02:41:13.764 region:rollup2

LARGEST.

02:41:19.637 --> 02:41:21.338 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

02:41:20.738 --> 02:41:21.805 region:rollup2
ONE LARGER CLASS SIZES FOR MY

02:41:21.338 --> 02:41:22.907 region:rollup2

THEY'RE GONNA SAY THIS CLASS

02:41:24.108 --> 02:41:27.745 region:rollup2
SIZES

02:41:24.975 --> 02:41:29.580 region:rollup2
IT IS TOO SMALL WE WANT MORE

02:41:27.745 --> 02:41:31.882 region:rollup2
KIDS. SUBJECT JUST YOU KNOW.

02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:33.751 region:rollup2
BE OPEN MINDED I WOULD ONLY ASK.

DOCTOR THANK YOU OF AND I'M NOT

OWN FINANCES SCHOOLS.

02:41:38.222 --> 02:41:42.159 region:rollup2
BUT I DO WANNA AND THEN I

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:43.260 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE MR KYLIE'S COMMENTS

02:41:42.159 --> 02:41:45.195 region:rollup2
ó I THINK THOSE ARE ARE ARE

02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:46.564 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BALLOT IN IMPORTANT

02:41:45.195 --> 02:41:48.165 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

02:41:46.564 --> 02:41:49.867 region:rollup2
AND PROBABLY NO ONE THE BANGS

02:41:48.165 --> 02:41:51.502 region:rollup2
HARDER THAN I DO ABOUT STUDENT

02:41:49.867 --> 02:41:52.836 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT HERE AT THIS AT THIS

02:41:51.502 --> 02:41:53.871 region:rollup2
HOUSE. AND I NEED FOR

02:41:52.836 --> 02:41:56.140 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:41:53.871 --> 02:41:57.308 region:rollup2
BUT I'VE ALSO ALWAYS TALKED

02:41:56.140 --> 02:42:01.378 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE

02:41:57.308 --> 02:42:01.378 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR

02:42:01.445 --> 02:42:03.948 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE

02:42:02.813 --> 02:42:05.649 region:rollup2
PROFESSION OF TEACHING

02:42:03.948 --> 02:42:07.084 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE A PROFESSION OF

02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:09.086 region:rollup2
DIGNITY AND IT'S MATCHED BY THE

02:42:07.084 --> 02:42:11.722 region:rollup2
RESOURCES SOMETIMES THAT WE PUT

02:42:09.086 --> 02:42:13.123 region:rollup2
INTO IT. THAT THE VALUE OF WHAT

02:42:11.722 --> 02:42:14.258 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE AND IS OFTEN

02:42:13.123 --> 02:42:15.392 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN WHERE WE SPEND OUR

02:42:14.258 --> 02:42:17.828 region:rollup2
MONEY.

02:42:15.392 --> 02:42:19.196 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY AND

02:42:17.828 --> 02:42:21.599 region:rollup2
IF WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR

02:42:19.196 --> 02:42:23.801 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE OF SIGNIFICANT.

02:42:21.599 --> 02:42:26.270 region:rollup2
THAT THE EDUCATION THEY GET WILL

02:42:23.801 --> 02:42:28.405 region:rollup2
BASICALLY UP ENHANCE THEIR LIVES

02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:29.006 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVE TO INVEST IN IT

02:42:28.405 --> 02:42:30.808 region:rollup2
THAT IS A ME WHENEVER HOLDEN

02:42:29.006 --> 02:42:33.711 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE. AND IN FACT I THINK

02:42:30.808 --> 02:42:33.711 region:rollup2
THE MORE WE GIVE THE MORE

02:42:33.777 --> 02:42:37.848 region:rollup2
BUT LE BUT IT ALSO HELPS US TO

02:42:35.879 --> 02:42:39.650 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THE KIND OF EDUCATIONAL

02:42:37.848 --> 02:42:41.518 region:rollup2
SETTING. IT HELPS TO DEVELOP

02:42:39.650 --> 02:42:43.220 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE TEACHING STAFF THAT

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:45.222 region:rollup2
WE WANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT

02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:46.557 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY ABOUT HAVING OUR

02:42:45.222 --> 02:42:47.925 region:rollup2
TEACHERS IS REALLY THE

02:42:46.557 --> 02:42:49.260 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL INFLUENCE

02:42:47.925 --> 02:42:51.562 region:rollup2
AND CHANGE THE LIVES OF OUR

02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:52.663 region:rollup2
CHILDREN EVERY DAY. ALL THOSE

02:42:51.562 --> 02:42:53.964 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS ARE CRITICAL

02:42:52.663 --> 02:42:55.799 region:rollup2
WELL IF FOR TEACHERS TO BE ABLE

02:42:53.964 --> 02:42:57.001 region:rollup2
TO RELATE TO STUDENTS AND

02:42:55.799 --> 02:42:59.903 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING

02:42:57.001 --> 02:43:00.137 region:rollup2
FROM. A TEACHER HAS TREMENDOUS

02:42:59.903 --> 02:43:01.839 region:rollup2
POWER.

02:43:00.137 --> 02:43:03.207 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS POWER

02:43:01.839 --> 02:43:04.775 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN FOR

02:43:03.207 --> 02:43:06.543 region:rollup2
THEIR WHOLE LIFE.

02:43:04.775 --> 02:43:08.012 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO BE ABLE TO BE IN A

02:43:06.543 --> 02:43:09.980 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM WHERE YOU REALLY GET A

02:43:08.012 --> 02:43:12.282 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO TALK TO AND TO MEET

02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:12.483 region:rollup2
WITH STUDENTS. ARE AND TRANSFORM

02:43:12.282 --> 02:43:15.452 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:43:12.483 --> 02:43:17.254 region:rollup2
INTO A RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS AS

02:43:15.452 --> 02:43:18.622 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF YOUR ABILITY TO CARE

02:43:17.254 --> 02:43:19.890 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AND TO MEET WITH THEM

02:43:18.622 --> 02:43:21.592 region:rollup2
ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS IS

02:43:19.890 --> 02:43:23.360 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW

02:43:21.592 --> 02:43:25.562 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAD SOME OF THE BEST

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:27.031 region:rollup2
OF SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD

02:43:25.562 --> 02:43:28.499 region:rollup2
AND WE STILL DO IT WITH OUR OUR

02:43:27.031 --> 02:43:30.034 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE IN OUR POST SECONDARY

02:43:28.499 --> 02:43:31.969 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

02:43:30.034 --> 02:43:33.404 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LOST OUR IT BECAUSE WE

02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:34.705 region:rollup2
HAVE LOST THAT WE'VE TAKEN OUR

02:43:33.404 --> 02:43:36.640 region:rollup2
EYE OFF OF WHAT WE NEED TO BE

02:43:34.705 --> 02:43:37.508 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON. AND WE SEE THE

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:39.276 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THAT.

02:43:37.508 --> 02:43:41.412 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY I MEAN

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:43.614 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN JUVENILE HALL THE

02:43:41.412 --> 02:43:44.748 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN PRISONS THOSE KINDS

02:43:43.614 --> 02:43:46.383 region:rollup2
OF THINGS AND WE SEE WHAT

02:43:44.748 --> 02:43:47.017 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IS A DIRECT RESULT

02:43:46.383 --> 02:43:48.485 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

02:43:47.017 --> 02:43:49.887 region:rollup2
OF OUR INABILITY TO HAVE AN

02:43:48.485 --> 02:43:51.889 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE SCHOOL SYSTEM MORE

02:43:49.887 --> 02:43:52.856 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TO REALLY MEET AND MEET

02:43:51.889 --> 02:43:54.425 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS OUT

02:43:52.856 --> 02:43:55.826 region:rollup2
OF THERE. AND SO I THINK WE'LL

02:43:54.425 --> 02:43:57.127 region:rollup2
SEE A LOT OF POSITIVES THAT COME

02:43:55.826 --> 02:43:58.262 region:rollup2
FROM WITH FACING TEACHER

02:43:57.127 --> 02:43:59.897 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES WHEN I WAS AT THE

02:43:58.262 --> 02:44:01.231 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY WAS HARD TO TALK TO A

02:43:59.897 --> 02:44:02.566 region:rollup2
PERSON ABOUT GOING INTO

02:44:01.231 --> 02:44:04.268 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. WHEN THEY DIDN'T

02:44:02.566 --> 02:44:06.036 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT WAS GOING TO NOT

02:44:04.268 --> 02:44:07.538 region:rollup2
ONLY JUST BE A PRODUCTIVE

02:44:06.036 --> 02:44:08.672 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. BUT ONE

02:44:07.538 --> 02:44:11.075 region:rollup2
THAT PUTS A WOOD MAY LIVE IN

02:44:08.672 --> 02:44:13.477 region:rollup2
POVERTY MOST OF THEIR LIVES A IN

02:44:11.075 --> 02:44:14.678 region:rollup2
TRYING TO JUST SIMPLY KEEP THE

02:44:13.477 --> 02:44:15.979 region:rollup2
PROFESSION THAT WAS THERE.

02:44:14.678 --> 02:44:17.281 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA OF THE PROFESSION

02:44:15.979 --> 02:44:18.449 region:rollup2
OF TEACHING BECAUSE I HAD

02:44:17.281 --> 02:44:20.284 region:rollup2
TEACHERS WHO I THOUGHT WERE

02:44:18.449 --> 02:44:22.119 region:rollup2
MILLIONAIRES AND THEY WORK BUT

02:44:20.284 --> 02:44:23.554 region:rollup2
THEY LOOK LIKE IN THE ACT LIKE

02:44:22.119 --> 02:44:24.955 region:rollup2
IT AND THEY HAVE RESOURCES

02:44:23.554 --> 02:44:26.323 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO THEM. THAT WE

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:28.125 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:29.526 region:rollup2
TO TEACHERS TODAY AND SO I YOU

02:44:28.125 --> 02:44:30.728 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS IS INVESTMENT IT'S

02:44:29.526 --> 02:44:32.496 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE A WISH LIST WE

02:44:30.728 --> 02:44:34.765 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A. THAT WE

02:44:32.496 --> 02:44:35.833 region:rollup2
MAY NOT GET THERE. BUT I ALWAYS

02:44:34.765 --> 02:44:37.101 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE

02:44:35.833 --> 02:44:39.269 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING ANY ROLE TO TAKE

02:44:37.101 --> 02:44:41.038 region:rollup2
YOU THERE. AND WE DO KNOW WHERE

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:42.339 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO GO IN THIS IS A PATH

02:44:41.038 --> 02:44:43.941 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO LEAD US THERE.

THE SAT IS AN ASSESSMENT.

02:59:33.963 --> 02:59:36.633 region:rollup2

02:59:51.848 --> 02:59:55.318 region:rollup2
THE S. BACK WAS INTENDED TO BE

02:59:53.683 --> 02:59:57.387 region:rollup2
MORE USEFUL TO TEACHERS BUT IS

02:59:55.318 --> 02:59:58.688 region:rollup2
NOT THERE YET AFTER FOUR YEARS

02:59:57.387 --> 03:00:00.256 region:rollup2

MISSION WERE WAITING.

03:00:00.256 --> 03:00:03.426 region:rollup2
THE SAT IS MEANINGFUL TO

STUDENTS THEY HAVE A STAKE IN

03:00:03.426 --> 03:00:06.562 region:rollup2
DOING WELL.

03:00:05.028 --> 03:00:08.231 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT

03:00:06.562 --> 03:00:09.098 region:rollup2
OF TESTING AND GIVE STUDENTS AND

03:00:08.231 --> 03:00:11.334 region:rollup2
TEACHERS MORE TIME FOR

03:00:09.098 --> 03:00:13.403 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION.

03:00:11.334 --> 03:00:14.771 region:rollup2
ELEVENTH GRADE IS A BUSY YEAR.

03:00:13.403 --> 03:00:16.072 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE NOT ONLY TAKING THE

03:00:14.771 --> 03:00:18.474 region:rollup2
RIVER THAT REQUIRED STATE TEST

03:00:16.072 --> 03:00:20.309 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO EIGHT P. AND COLLEGE

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:21.744 region:rollup2
ENTRANCE EXAMS.

03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:22.378 region:rollup2
AND LET ME ADDRESS SOME OF THE

03:00:21.744 --> 03:00:24.180 region:rollup2
CONCERNS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS

03:00:22.378 --> 03:00:26.549 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:29.018 region:rollup2
WE'LL ACCOMMODATIONS BE REQUIRED

03:00:26.549 --> 03:00:30.853 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THE ANSWER IS YES.

03:00:29.018 --> 03:00:32.722 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS WILL BE BASED ON

03:00:30.853 --> 03:00:34.157 region:rollup2
A STUDENT'S I EP OR FIVE OH FOR

03:00:32.722 --> 03:00:35.425 region:rollup2
PLAN.

03:00:34.157 --> 03:00:37.193 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WILL NOT BE IDENTICAL

03:00:35.425 --> 03:00:38.961 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMMODATIONS PROVIDED FOR

03:00:37.193 --> 03:00:40.563 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TAKING THE ASPECT.

03:00:38.961 --> 03:00:43.333 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE IT ACCOMODATIONS ARE

03:00:40.563 --> 03:00:44.867 region:rollup2
UNIQUE TO THE US BACK.

03:00:43.333 --> 03:00:46.803 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ITS A COMPUTER TEST

03:00:44.867 --> 03:00:49.105 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL NOT APPLY TO THE SAT

03:00:46.803 --> 03:00:50.673 region:rollup2
OR ACT BECAUSE AGAIN IT IS NOT.

03:00:49.105 --> 03:00:51.140 region:rollup2
A COMPUTER CHESS SO SOME OF

03:00:50.673 --> 03:00:52.375 region:rollup2
THOSE WILL BE A LITTLE

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:53.843 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

03:00:52.375 --> 03:00:55.845 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS WILL BE EASIER TO

03:00:53.843 --> 03:00:57.847 region:rollup2
COORDINATE.

03:00:55.845 --> 03:00:59.682 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S US IT'S THE TEST IS

03:00:57.847 --> 03:01:01.317 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED AT THE SCHOOL SITE.

03:00:59.682 --> 03:01:03.386 region:rollup2
THE REQUEST WILL BE HANDLED BY A

03:01:01.317 --> 03:01:04.954 region:rollup2
SCHOOL STAFF BY SCHOOL STAFF OR

03:01:03.386 --> 03:01:06.422 region:rollup2
COUNCIL RATHER THAN A PARENT

03:01:04.954 --> 03:01:09.125 region:rollup2
NAVIGATING.

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:10.360 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS ALONG.

03:01:09.125 --> 03:01:11.894 region:rollup2
WILL BE OUT ALTERNATIVE

03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:13.563 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS BE ALIGNED TO OUR

03:01:11.894 --> 03:01:14.030 region:rollup2
STATE STANDARDS THAT HAS BEEN

03:01:13.563 --> 03:01:15.865 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CONCERNS.

03:01:14.030 --> 03:01:18.167 region:rollup2
PRESENTED.

03:01:15.865 --> 03:01:19.035 region:rollup2
THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT.

03:01:18.167 --> 03:01:20.737 region:rollup2
I WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE

03:01:19.035 --> 03:01:22.538 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS NO ONE TEST NOT

03:01:20.737 --> 03:01:24.574 region:rollup2
EVEN THE ESPECTADOR THAT IS

03:01:22.538 --> 03:01:26.442 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY ALIGNED TO THE COMMON

03:01:24.574 --> 03:01:28.311 region:rollup2
CORE STANDARDS.

03:01:26.442 --> 03:01:30.413 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE FIFTEEN CONCOURSE

03:01:28.311 --> 03:01:31.948 region:rollup2
DATES MAY HAVE CHANGED OR ADDED

03:01:30.413 --> 03:01:33.282 region:rollup2
TO THE STANDARDS BUT THE S. BACK

03:01:31.948 --> 03:01:35.651 region:rollup2
AS THE SAME TEST.

03:01:33.282 --> 03:01:37.453 region:rollup2
FOR ALL PARTICIPATING STATES.

03:01:35.651 --> 03:01:39.689 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN.

03:01:37.453 --> 03:01:40.690 region:rollup2
ARE THE SCORES FOR STUDENTS WITH

03:01:39.689 --> 03:01:43.459 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES AND ELS STUDENTS

03:01:40.690 --> 03:01:45.027 region:rollup2
INVALID FOR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS.

03:01:43.459 --> 03:01:46.162 region:rollup2
NO BECAUSE THE ACCOMMODATIONS

03:01:45.027 --> 03:01:47.363 region:rollup2
ARE WORKED OUT AND PLAN FOR

03:01:46.162 --> 03:01:49.699 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF TIME.

03:01:47.363 --> 03:01:50.833 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN.

03:01:49.699 --> 03:01:51.934 region:rollup2
DOES THE ACHIEVE REPORT THERE'S

03:01:50.833 --> 03:01:53.436 region:rollup2
A REPORT CALLED THE ACHIEVE

03:01:51.934 --> 03:01:55.104 region:rollup2
REPORT RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS

03:01:53.436 --> 03:01:57.974 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

03:01:55.104 --> 03:02:00.276 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE IS AFFILIATED WITH PARK

03:01:57.974 --> 03:02:02.345 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMMON CORE TEST IT HAS

03:02:00.276 --> 03:02:03.713 region:rollup2
AVENGED VESTED INTERESTS OR THE

03:02:02.345 --> 03:02:05.314 region:rollup2
ACHIEVED TASK BE ACHIEVED.

03:02:03.713 --> 03:02:07.150 region:rollup2
REPORT.

03:02:05.314 --> 03:02:07.583 region:rollup2
WAS ASSOCIATE WITH A COMPANY

03:02:07.150 --> 03:02:08.985 region:rollup2
THAT GIVES ANOTHER.

03:02:07.583 --> 03:02:09.986 region:rollup2
TEST.

03:02:08.985 --> 03:02:11.154 region:rollup2
OR SO. A GROUP TO GET ANOTHER

03:02:09.986 --> 03:02:13.623 region:rollup2
TEST

03:02:11.154 --> 03:02:14.490 region:rollup2
IT ALSO NEGLECTED TO CITE

03:02:13.623 --> 03:02:16.259 region:rollup2
FAVORABLE STUDIES TOWARDS OTHER

03:02:14.490 --> 03:02:18.127 region:rollup2
TESTS.

03:02:16.259 --> 03:02:19.662 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN

03:02:18.127 --> 03:02:21.898 region:rollup2
CAN WE USE THE SAT FOR

03:02:19.662 --> 03:02:23.466 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PURPOSES.

03:02:21.898 --> 03:02:26.135 region:rollup2
THERE IS DEFINITELY A WAY TO

03:02:23.466 --> 03:02:27.770 region:rollup2
ALIGN THE SAT WITH THE S. BACK

03:02:26.135 --> 03:02:29.872 region:rollup2
SCORES THROUGH CORDONED

03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:32.742 region:rollup2
CONCURRENT CONCORDANCE STUDIES.

03:02:29.872 --> 03:02:34.443 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET A SAT SCORE FOR EACH.

03:02:32.742 --> 03:02:35.578 region:rollup2
S. BACK PERFORMANCE LEVEL YES WE

MEMBERS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE

03:02:36.879 --> 03:02:40.283 region:rollup2

TO COLLEGE YES YES I DO IN AND

03:24:23.752 --> 03:24:26.955 region:rollup2
AND SO AS A RESULT I ALWAYS GET

03:24:26.020 --> 03:24:29.457 region:rollup2
CRITICIZED BECAUSE I'M NOT GOOD

03:24:26.955 --> 03:24:31.192 region:rollup2
ENOUGH. WHATEVER CT  <u><c.green>IN</c></u>

03:24:29.457 --> 03:24:31.793 region:rollup2
THIS IN THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE I

03:24:31.192 --> 03:24:33.628 region:rollup2
FIGURED FOLKS CAN DO THAT AS

03:24:31.793 --> 03:24:34.863 region:rollup2
WELL. SOME ALWAYS PUSHING THE

03:24:33.628 --> 03:24:37.765 region:rollup2
COLLEGE PIECE THAT SURVEYOR BUT

03:24:34.863 --> 03:24:39.200 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOW THAT I'VE HAD STUDENTS

03:24:37.765 --> 03:24:40.802 region:rollup2
WHEREBY SAFETY NET YOU NEED TO

03:24:39.200 --> 03:24:41.336 region:rollup2
TAKE THEIR SAFETY. AND THEY TAKE

03:24:40.802 --> 03:24:42.470 region:rollup2
IT AND THEY DON'T DO WELL

03:24:41.336 --> 03:24:43.238 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND

03:24:42.470 --> 03:24:45.673 region:rollup2
THAT THE S. A. T. IS A LIFE

03:24:43.238 --> 03:24:46.341 region:rollup2
JOURNEY ALMOST TO GET TO THE

03:24:45.673 --> 03:24:48.209 region:rollup2
POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL AND

03:24:46.341 --> 03:24:49.911 region:rollup2
IT. IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DECIDED

03:24:48.209 --> 03:24:51.546 region:rollup2
TO IN ELEVENTH GRADE. AND IT HAS

03:24:49.911 --> 03:24:54.249 region:rollup2
TO BE A LOT OF PREPARATION IN

03:24:51.546 --> 03:24:59.287 region:rollup2
ADVANCE TO TO TAKE THAT THAT

03:24:54.249 --> 03:25:01.055 region:rollup2
EXAM AND DO WELL ON IT.

03:24:59.287 --> 03:25:02.457 region:rollup2
I AM SO I'VE SEEN STUDENTS EVEN

03:25:01.055 --> 03:25:05.994 region:rollup2
GOOD STUDENTS WHO'VE TAKEN AND

03:25:02.457 --> 03:25:08.062 region:rollup2
NOT DONE WELL. IN A BEEN CRUSHED

03:25:05.994 --> 03:25:08.930 region:rollup2
BY BY THE SCORES AT AT THE IT IN

03:25:08.062 --> 03:25:11.766 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP TO THE GPA AND SO

03:25:08.930 --> 03:25:12.133 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES

03:25:11.766 --> 03:25:12.267 region:rollup2
INTO IT AND AND.

03:25:12.133 --> 03:25:13.468 region:rollup2
.

03:25:12.267 --> 03:25:14.302 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S VALUE IN

03:25:13.468 --> 03:25:15.537 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FOLKS

03:25:14.302 --> 03:25:16.137 region:rollup2
WHO TAKE THE EXAMPLE IN TERMS OF

03:25:15.537 --> 03:25:16.404 region:rollup2
THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE

03:25:16.137 --> 03:25:17.105 region:rollup2
TO THEM.

03:25:16.404 --> 03:25:18.606 region:rollup2
BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

03:25:17.105 --> 03:25:20.675 region:rollup2
PRE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE

03:25:18.606 --> 03:25:22.177 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO POST BE JUST SAY WE

03:25:22.177 --> 03:25:25.647 region:rollup2
I'M ONE YOU DISTRICTS REALIZE

03:25:24.112 --> 03:25:28.316 region:rollup2
THAT IF THEY DECIDE TO GO THAT

03:25:25.647 --> 03:25:30.218 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING. I DIDN'T SEE

03:25:28.316 --> 03:25:32.654 region:rollup2

03:25:47.535 --> 03:25:49.404 region:rollup2
THEM HAVE DONE THAT I'VE SEEN

03:25:48.169 --> 03:25:51.206 region:rollup2
LOTS OF SCHOOLS WHO PUSHED THE

03:25:49.404 --> 03:25:52.974 region:rollup2

COLLEGE OR THEY MAY THE

03:25:56.978 --> 03:25:58.880 region:rollup2
PATERNITY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE

03:25:58.046 --> 03:26:00.849 region:rollup2
ENDED UP ANYWHERE WITHOUT. EVEN

03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:02.917 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE TEST SO I'M JUST

03:26:00.849 --> 03:26:03.518 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOME ALMOST

03:26:02.917 --> 03:26:05.353 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE I'M IN A RUSH TO

03:26:03.518 --> 03:26:10.825 region:rollup2
JUDGMENT WITH REGARDS TO. THE A

03:26:05.353 --> 03:26:11.593 region:rollup2
FULL BILL THAT REALLY SAYS I

03:26:10.825 --> 03:26:11.793 region:rollup2
SHOULD GET RID OF THIS TEST.

03:26:11.593 --> 03:26:13.795 region:rollup2
AND.

03:26:11.793 --> 03:26:14.829 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW ALL

03:26:13.795 --> 03:26:16.631 region:rollup2
MOVE ON TO THESE OTHERS THAT AT

03:26:14.829 --> 03:26:17.665 region:rollup2
THE I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN TOLD

03:26:16.631 --> 03:26:18.633 region:rollup2
THAT THE S. A. T. IS CHANGED

03:26:17.665 --> 03:26:19.968 region:rollup2
SINCE I TOOK IT.

03:26:18.633 --> 03:26:22.270 region:rollup2
THOUSAND YEARS AGO.

03:26:19.968 --> 03:26:24.272 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS CHANGE EVEN SINCE

03:26:22.270 --> 03:26:25.907 region:rollup2
MY KIDS TOOK IT OUT TO TRY TO

03:26:24.272 --> 03:26:27.775 region:rollup2
ALIGN ITSELF WITH THAT. BUT I I

03:26:25.907 --> 03:26:29.277 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA GETS INTO

03:26:27.775 --> 03:26:31.646 region:rollup2
THIS THING SOMETIMES WHAT WE

03:26:29.277 --> 03:26:33.481 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT

03:26:31.646 --> 03:26:34.649 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE FLIP OVER GO TO

03:26:33.481 --> 03:26:35.817 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE AND IT WOULD GO

03:26:34.649 --> 03:26:37.018 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE AND SOMETHING

03:26:35.817 --> 03:26:38.953 region:rollup2

NOW AND WHERE THE NOT YOU KNOW

03:26:39.954 --> 03:26:42.724 region:rollup2
IT IT IT WHETHER THE ASSESSMENTS

03:26:41.022 --> 03:26:43.625 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY INFORMING NOT ONLY

03:26:42.724 --> 03:26:45.593 region:rollup2
HOW WELL KIDS ARE DOING. BUT

03:26:43.625 --> 03:26:46.461 region:rollup2

NEED TO GO. SO I JUST LIKE

03:26:51.165 --> 03:26:55.203 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT MORE CONVERSATION

03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:59.607 region:rollup2

03:26:55.203 --> 03:27:00.308 region:rollup2
SOME PADDED TOWARD I MAY VOTE

03:26:59.607 --> 03:27:01.309 region:rollup2
FOR JUST TO GET IT.

03:27:00.308 --> 03:27:02.443 region:rollup2
MORE CONVERSATION.

03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:03.444 region:rollup2
GIVE IT TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT

03:27:02.443 --> 03:27:04.112 region:rollup2

BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A LOT OF

03:27:06.748 --> 03:27:10.084 region:rollup2
WILL GOAL.

03:27:07.548 --> 03:27:12.153 region:rollup2
AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF

03:27:10.084 --> 03:27:13.621 region:rollup2
THOSE FOLKS ARE DOING IT. AND

03:27:12.153 --> 03:27:17.358 region:rollup2
ARE DOING IT ALREADY.

03:27:13.621 --> 03:27:18.693 region:rollup2
WITH THE OTHER TEST THERE I

03:27:17.358 --> 03:27:20.061 region:rollup2

THEY HAVE TO START GETTING USED

03:30:59.447 --> 03:31:02.884 region:rollup2

PROBABLY ANSWERED MY QUESTION IS

03:31:06.020 --> 03:31:09.857 region:rollup2
WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS UP BUT

03:31:08.556 --> 03:31:10.424 region:rollup2
ONLY BECAUSE. ONLY BECAUSE

03:31:09.857 --> 03:31:13.261 region:rollup2

03:31:10.424 --> 03:31:14.529 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK

PARTICULAR IN LONG BEACH.

03:31:14.529 --> 03:31:16.397 region:rollup2

03:31:15.296 --> 03:31:18.366 region:rollup2
WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR A LONG

03:31:16.397 --> 03:31:20.334 region:rollup2
TIME WITH THE PSE AND MOVING IT

03:31:18.366 --> 03:31:22.036 region:rollup2
FORWARD SO THAT. YOU DOING THE

03:31:20.334 --> 03:31:23.437 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT EARLY IN THE GAME

03:31:22.036 --> 03:31:24.805 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE DOING THOSE KINDS OF

03:31:23.437 --> 03:31:27.642 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT BRING THAT BRING YOU

03:31:24.805 --> 03:31:28.976 region:rollup2
TO THE SAT. LA ELEVENTH GRADE

03:31:27.642 --> 03:31:31.312 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN THE LEVIN GREAT YOU

03:31:28.976 --> 03:31:32.747 region:rollup2
DO AN ESSAY T. AND. ALL THE

03:31:31.312 --> 03:31:34.615 region:rollup2
OTHER STUFF IS NOT THE OR SO I

03:31:32.747 --> 03:31:35.983 region:rollup2
DON'T YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY

03:31:34.615 --> 03:31:39.453 region:rollup2
TORN WITH THIS.

03:31:35.983 --> 03:31:41.022 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID I MADE JUST TO JUST

03:31:39.453 --> 03:31:43.624 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU TO PUSH

03:31:41.022 --> 03:31:47.762 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION FORWARD.

03:31:43.624 --> 03:31:48.462 region:rollup2
BUT I'M OUT BUT I AM CONCERNED

03:31:47.762 --> 03:31:49.397 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:31:48.462 --> 03:31:49.931 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T BECOME ANOTHER SHINY

03:31:49.397 --> 03:31:50.264 region:rollup2
OBJECT TO US IN THE IN THE

03:31:49.931 --> 03:31:51.632 region:rollup2
STATE.

03:31:50.264 --> 03:31:52.900 region:rollup2
THAT THE HARD WORK THAT IS DONE

03:31:51.632 --> 03:31:53.834 region:rollup2
THE CHIU M. INDICATING IS NOT

03:31:52.900 --> 03:31:55.703 region:rollup2
JUST US PASSING THE ABILITY FOR

03:31:53.834 --> 03:31:57.538 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO DO IT. IT'S REALLY

03:31:55.703 --> 03:31:58.940 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE OF THOSE WHO DECIDE

03:31:57.538 --> 03:32:00.608 region:rollup2
TO DO IT UNDERSTAND A WHOLE

03:31:58.940 --> 03:32:02.243 region:rollup2
PACKAGE THIS THE AIR AND NOT

03:32:00.608 --> 03:32:03.444 region:rollup2
JUST THE CHANGE FROM ONE TEST TO

03:32:02.243 --> 03:32:04.779 region:rollup2
THE OTHER. THAT THERE ARE

03:32:03.444 --> 03:32:06.747 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES

03:32:04.779 --> 03:32:07.615 region:rollup2
INTO IT AND I RESPECT THE WORK

03:32:06.747 --> 03:32:09.383 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENS I KNOW WOULD LONG

03:32:07.615 --> 03:32:11.719 region:rollup2
BEACH DOES. I RESPECT THAT HARD

03:32:09.383 --> 03:32:12.386 region:rollup2
WORK THIS THERE AND THE QUESTION

03:32:11.719 --> 03:32:14.822 region:rollup2
BECOMES WHETHER NOT THAT'S GOING

03:32:12.386 --> 03:32:17.258 region:rollup2
TO BE. INCORPORATED IN SOMETHING

03:32:14.822 --> 03:32:19.126 region:rollup2
HERE THAT DEMANDS THIS LEVEL OF

03:32:17.258 --> 03:32:20.661 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING AND THE HARD WORK

03:32:19.126 --> 03:32:23.197 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO OCCUR.

03:32:20.661 --> 03:32:25.166 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I KNOW SOME

03:32:23.197 --> 03:32:26.067 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO DO IT AND SOME FOLKS

03:32:25.166 --> 03:32:26.267 region:rollup2
WHO DO THE SHINY OBJECT.

03:32:26.067 --> 03:32:28.169 region:rollup2
AND.

03:32:26.267 --> 03:32:29.637 region:rollup2
AND IN THE END WE WON'T SEE

03:32:28.169 --> 03:32:32.139 region:rollup2
NECESSARY THE KIND OF RESULTS WE

03:32:29.637 --> 03:32:33.908 region:rollup2
WANT WE CHANGE TESTING WE WILL

03:32:32.139 --> 03:32:35.910 region:rollup2
NOT SEE MORE STUDENTS BEING

03:32:33.908 --> 03:32:36.577 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN GOING TO COLLEGE

03:32:35.910 --> 03:32:38.446 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE THE BILL THAT THIS THE

03:32:36.577 --> 03:32:39.780 region:rollup2
DISCOURSE. AND ACT SCORES BUT

03:32:38.446 --> 03:32:41.382 region:rollup2
THEY MAY NOT BE ANYTHING THAT

03:32:39.780 --> 03:32:43.351 region:rollup2
WOULD GET THEM INTO ANYBODY'S

03:32:41.382 --> 03:32:44.919 region:rollup2
COLLEGE TO HELP THEM IN THAT

03:32:43.351 --> 03:32:47.054 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF THAT SO THERE WILL BE

03:32:44.919 --> 03:32:48.723 region:rollup2
A CHECK OFF THE BOX. IF THEY GOT

03:32:47.054 --> 03:32:49.390 region:rollup2
GREAT GPAS DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT

03:32:48.723 --> 03:32:52.293 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE IN THIS CITY SO THAT'S

03:32:49.390 --> 03:32:53.928 region:rollup2
MY THAT'S MY CONCERN AND UP.

03:32:52.293 --> 03:32:56.464 region:rollup2

SOMEONE TOLD ME THE CHANGE AND

03:33:00.401 --> 03:33:02.670 region:rollup2
ALL THAT GOOD ASSESSMENT BETTER

03:33:01.035 --> 03:33:04.338 region:rollup2
CARS. BUT I DON'T JUST WANT US

03:33:02.670 --> 03:33:07.942 region:rollup2
TO BE CHANGING TO BE CHANGING

03:33:04.338 --> 03:33:08.743 region:rollup2
AND NOT HAVE. THE OF THE BREASTS

03:33:07.942 --> 03:33:12.913 region:rollup2
OF THE WORK THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE

03:33:08.743 --> 03:33:14.782 region:rollup2

CHAIR I JUST BE CLEAR THAT THE

03:33:15.983 --> 03:33:17.385 region:rollup2
PURPOSE. OF THIS BILL ARE

03:33:16.517 --> 03:33:18.653 region:rollup2
SIMPLE.

03:33:17.385 --> 03:33:20.121 region:rollup2
OTHER CLEAR AT ABOUT LOCAL

03:33:18.653 --> 03:33:21.522 region:rollup2
CONTROL THAT THE DISTRICTS ASIDE

03:33:20.121 --> 03:33:22.757 region:rollup2
WHAT ASSESSMENT IS BEST FOR

03:33:21.522 --> 03:33:24.325 region:rollup2
THEIR STUDENTS BUT. THERE MUST

03:33:22.757 --> 03:33:26.360 region:rollup2
BE AN ASSESSMENT.

03:33:24.325 --> 03:33:27.962 region:rollup2
THE SAT IS MORE MEANINGFUL TO

03:33:26.360 --> 03:33:29.597 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IT MEANS A LOT MORE

03:33:27.962 --> 03:33:31.132 region:rollup2
THEY ARE INVESTED IN.

03:33:29.597 --> 03:33:33.200 region:rollup2
IT WILL INCREASE COLLEGE GOING

03:33:31.132 --> 03:33:35.603 region:rollup2
RATES INSURES THAT STUDENTS TAKE

03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:38.306 region:rollup2
A COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM.

03:33:35.603 --> 03:33:40.875 region:rollup2
SAT IS MORE OF AN ASSESSMENT NOT

03:33:38.306 --> 03:33:42.643 region:rollup2
JUST A TEST WE DISCUSS THAT.

03:33:40.875 --> 03:33:44.311 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE LESS TASK THAT ELEVENTH

03:33:42.643 --> 03:33:45.279 region:rollup2
GRADER HAS TO TAKE IN YOU'VE GOT

03:33:44.311 --> 03:33:47.014 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU GIVE THE

03:33:45.279 --> 03:33:48.716 region:rollup2
ASPECTHAST ON A SCHOOL SITE THE

03:33:47.014 --> 03:33:50.184 region:rollup2
LOGISTICS ARE PRETTY INCREDIBLE

03:33:48.716 --> 03:33:51.252 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO MOVE CLASSES YOU

03:33:50.184 --> 03:33:53.020 region:rollup2
HAVE TO CHANGE THE DAY YOU HAVE

03:33:51.252 --> 03:33:55.222 region:rollup2
TO BRING IT OFTEN. SUBSTITUTE

03:33:53.020 --> 03:33:56.357 region:rollup2
TEACHERS SOME TEST ADVISORS FROM

03:33:55.222 --> 03:33:57.958 region:rollup2
FROM THE FROM THE DISTRICT LEVEL

03:33:56.357 --> 03:33:59.994 region:rollup2
TO REALLY GET THE DAY MOVING AND

03:33:57.958 --> 03:34:01.028 region:rollup2
GET THE TEST TAKEN AND YOU GOT

03:33:59.994 --> 03:34:02.930 region:rollup2
TO CAPTURE THE KIDS THAT WEREN'T

03:34:01.028 --> 03:34:04.799 region:rollup2
THERE SO IT'S A. HUGE LOGISTICAL

03:34:02.930 --> 03:34:06.500 region:rollup2
VENTURE AS WELL ALL THE SIMPLE

03:34:04.799 --> 03:34:08.402 region:rollup2
VICE THAT YOU KNOW THE S. C. A.

03:34:06.500 --> 03:34:09.370 region:rollup2

LANGUAGE HERE THIS IS NOT. I

03:48:03.603 --> 03:48:06.840 region:rollup2

HOWEVER.

CLOSE TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THOSE

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT ARE

04:20:56.508 --> 04:20:59.544 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE

04:20:57.976 --> 04:21:00.745 region:rollup2
FACT IS THAT A VAST MAJORITY OF

04:20:59.544 --> 04:21:02.647 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOLS ALREADY ARE

04:21:00.745 --> 04:21:03.815 region:rollup2

TO DO THAT.

04:21:41.152 --> 04:21:45.690 region:rollup2
EVEN WHEN THE SCHOOLS HAVE

04:26:45.957 --> 04:26:48.893 region:rollup2
MORE.

04:26:46.557 --> 04:26:51.729 region:rollup2
THEM MORE SPECIFIC.

04:26:48.893 --> 04:26:54.765 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ISSUES OF SCALE SIZE

04:26:51.729 --> 04:26:56.367 region:rollup2
LOCATION AND RURAL LOCATIONS.

04:26:54.765 --> 04:26:57.235 region:rollup2
AYE WE'VE HAD SCHOOLS THAT THAT

04:26:56.367 --> 04:26:58.336 region:rollup2
HAVE BASICALLY HAD TO CHOOSE

04:26:57.235 --> 04:27:00.238 region:rollup2
BETWEEN MALES AND AND

04:26:58.336 --> 04:27:01.839 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION.

04:27:00.238 --> 04:27:04.175 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT

04:27:01.839 --> 04:27:07.612 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN SUCH A SMALL

04:27:04.175 --> 04:27:09.313 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AYE BUT SO SO. THERE

04:27:07.612 --> 04:27:11.249 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ARE TRADE OFFS FOR

04:27:09.313 --> 04:27:14.585 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN MY AND.

04:27:11.249 --> 04:27:15.953 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. AS IMPORTANT AS THIS

04:27:14.585 --> 04:27:19.190 region:rollup2
GOAL IS.

04:27:15.953 --> 04:27:21.626 region:rollup2
THE IT DOES COME WITH TRADE

04:27:19.190 --> 04:27:22.393 region:rollup2
OFFS AND LIKELY GET SEASON IN

04:27:21.626 --> 04:27:25.062 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND START OF GRANTS

04:27:22.393 --> 04:27:27.565 region:rollup2
ALONE. AND THEN THERE'S FACILITY

04:27:25.062 --> 04:27:30.167 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT FLOWS EVERY YEAR TOO

04:27:27.565 --> 04:27:32.703 region:rollup2
SO LET'S JUST REMIND PEOPLE IN

04:27:30.167 --> 04:27:36.240 region:rollup2
THE ROOM OF THAT. ARE WITHOUT

04:27:32.703 --> 04:27:38.075 region:rollup2
OTHERS TOWARDS ANY OF THE OTHER

04:27:36.240 --> 04:27:39.477 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WISH TO.

04:27:38.075 --> 04:27:40.044 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR OF THE AUTHOR QUESTION

04:27:39.477 --> 04:27:42.179 region:rollup2
YEAH.

04:27:40.044 --> 04:27:43.080 region:rollup2
IT I APPLAUD THE THE THIS YEAR

04:27:42.179 --> 04:27:44.181 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OUT. I WAS NOT AWARE

04:27:43.080 --> 04:27:44.849 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DIDN'T

04:27:44.181 --> 04:27:45.416 region:rollup2
PROVIDE LUNCHEON IN LOW INCOME

04:27:44.849 --> 04:27:46.050 region:rollup2
AREAS I THINK MOST OF THEM

04:27:45.416 --> 04:27:46.617 region:rollup2
PROBABLY DO I'M NOT SURE. BUT

04:27:46.050 --> 04:27:47.218 region:rollup2
THE RULE AREAS AND ALL THOSE

04:27:46.617 --> 04:27:47.785 region:rollup2
KINDS OF PLACES BUT I DO KNOW

04:27:47.218 --> 04:27:48.386 region:rollup2
THAT. I THINK MOST OF THE

04:27:47.785 --> 04:27:49.353 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO

04:27:48.386 --> 04:27:49.921 region:rollup2
PROVIDE OF LUNCH FOR THE

04:27:49.353 --> 04:27:51.489 region:rollup2
CHILDREN BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

04:27:49.921 --> 04:27:52.256 region:rollup2
CENTRAL KITCHENS AND SO FORTH

04:27:51.489 --> 04:27:52.857 region:rollup2
AND SO ON.

04:27:52.256 --> 04:27:53.991 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WAS GO BACK TO THE

04:27:52.857 --> 04:27:55.026 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZES STORY AS TO WHO

04:27:53.991 --> 04:27:56.093 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED THE CHARTER AND WITH

04:27:55.026 --> 04:27:58.062 region:rollup2
THE NOT IN AUTHORIZING THE CHART

04:27:56.093 --> 04:27:59.397 region:rollup2
OF THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY. TO

04:27:58.062 --> 04:28:01.265 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS TAKING

04:27:59.397 --> 04:28:02.366 region:rollup2
CARE FEEDING KIDS IS FUNDAMENTAL

04:28:01.265 --> 04:28:03.634 region:rollup2
YOU KNOWESPECIALLY IN POOR

04:28:02.366 --> 04:28:05.369 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE MAY

04:28:03.634 --> 04:28:06.404 region:rollup2
NOT BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT

04:28:05.369 --> 04:28:08.105 region:rollup2
I THINK MANY OF OUR CHARTIST

04:28:06.404 --> 04:28:09.273 region:rollup2
RESPONDED THAT. BUT IT SEEMS

04:28:08.105 --> 04:28:10.741 region:rollup2
THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME

04:28:09.273 --> 04:28:12.910 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF

04:28:10.741 --> 04:28:15.446 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORIZING AGENCY TO AT

04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:17.648 region:rollup2
LEAST SHARE IF IT'S IF THEY HAVE

04:28:15.446 --> 04:28:19.483 region:rollup2
CENTRAL KITCHENS OR WHATEVER TO.

04:28:17.648 --> 04:28:21.419 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW FOLKS TO I HAVE THE

04:28:19.483 --> 04:28:22.053 region:rollup2
BILL'S BODY AND I KNOW WE DO

04:28:21.419 --> 04:28:22.620 region:rollup2
THAT WITH.

04:28:22.053 --> 04:28:25.189 region:rollup2
WITH MANY OF OUR.

04:28:22.620 --> 04:28:28.292 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN

04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:30.261 region:rollup2
STRIP MALLS FOR KIDS WHO ARE.

04:28:28.292 --> 04:28:31.495 region:rollup2
WHO BEEN A PLACED IN THESE

04:28:30.261 --> 04:28:32.863 region:rollup2
FACILITIES LIKE ALTERNATIVE

04:28:31.495 --> 04:28:34.265 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS IN THE AND THERE THE

04:28:32.863 --> 04:28:35.900 region:rollup2
SMALLER AND I'VE BEEN IN THOSE

04:28:34.265 --> 04:28:37.268 region:rollup2
PLACES WHERE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

04:28:35.900 --> 04:28:39.103 region:rollup2
IS DRIVE ALL THOSE PLACES AND

04:28:37.268 --> 04:28:40.838 region:rollup2
BRINGS LUNCH? EVERYDAY TO THOSE

04:28:39.103 --> 04:28:41.739 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SO THIS SHOULD BE SOME

04:28:40.838 --> 04:28:43.874 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY.

04:28:41.739 --> 04:28:45.543 region:rollup2
ON THE PART OF IT AND I I NEVER

04:28:43.874 --> 04:28:47.511 region:rollup2
LIKED THE FIGHT THAT WE HAVE TO

04:28:45.543 --> 04:28:48.846 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN BETWEEN THE CHARTER

04:28:47.511 --> 04:28:50.514 region:rollup2
AND WHATEVER WE CONSIDER THE

04:28:48.846 --> 04:28:51.849 region:rollup2
OTHERS BECAUSE. YOU ALWAYS SAY

04:28:50.514 --> 04:28:53.117 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE AFRICAN

04:28:51.849 --> 04:28:54.986 region:rollup2
PROVERB TELLS ME WHEN TWO

04:28:53.117 --> 04:28:55.753 region:rollup2
ELEPHANTS FIGHT IS THE GRASS

04:28:54.986 --> 04:28:57.254 region:rollup2
THAT SUFFERS.

04:28:55.753 --> 04:28:59.190 region:rollup2
AND IN THIS CASE THE GRASS IS

04:28:57.254 --> 04:29:00.091 region:rollup2
THE KIDS YOU KNOW WE SHOULD NOT

04:28:59.190 --> 04:29:02.326 region:rollup2
BE INVOLVED IN THIS BIG

04:29:00.091 --> 04:29:03.928 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT FOOD THAT IS SO

04:29:02.326 --> 04:29:05.529 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL. AND.

04:29:03.928 --> 04:29:07.498 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF OUR OF FREE AND

04:29:05.529 --> 04:29:09.166 region:rollup2
REDUCED LUNCH THINGS COME TO

04:29:07.498 --> 04:29:10.835 region:rollup2
PARK AND REC AND EVERYWHERE ELSE

04:29:09.166 --> 04:29:12.003 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE ELECTION SO WE HAVE

04:29:10.835 --> 04:29:13.604 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

04:29:12.003 --> 04:29:14.839 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S JUST THAT IMPORTANT

04:29:13.604 --> 04:29:16.440 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IF YOU'RE TEACHING

04:29:14.839 --> 04:29:17.008 region:rollup2
KIDS WILL POUR IN THIS IS

04:29:16.440 --> 04:29:18.042 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE ONLY MEAL THEY

04:29:17.008 --> 04:29:20.311 region:rollup2
HAVE.

04:29:18.042 --> 04:29:21.612 region:rollup2
ARE IT IT HAS TO HAPPEN SO WE

04:29:20.311 --> 04:29:23.314 region:rollup2
NEED TO FIGURE OUT MAKE IT

04:29:21.612 --> 04:29:25.349 region:rollup2
HAPPEN HOPEFULLY. IN THIS BILL

04:29:23.314 --> 04:29:27.585 region:rollup2
YOU GOTTA FIGURE IT OUT BUT I

04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:28.853 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK ANY CHILD SHOULD.

04:29:27.585 --> 04:29:29.820 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE A THEY'VE MEAL.

04:29:28.853 --> 04:29:31.122 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY KIDS WILL POOR

04:29:29.820 --> 04:29:33.024 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THIS IS THEIR

04:29:31.122 --> 04:29:34.125 region:rollup2
MEAL.

04:29:33.024 --> 04:29:35.426 region:rollup2
AND I'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

04:29:34.125 --> 04:29:36.961 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE HUNGRY A BIT IN OTHER

04:29:35.426 --> 04:29:38.529 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES WHERE KIDS DON'T GET

04:29:36.961 --> 04:29:39.597 region:rollup2
FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. AND THEY

04:29:38.529 --> 04:29:41.465 region:rollup2
SPEND ALL DAY THINKING ABOUT

04:29:39.597 --> 04:29:42.066 region:rollup2
FOOD AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO PICK

04:29:41.465 --> 04:29:44.101 region:rollup2
ABOUT LEARNING WHEN YOU THINK

04:29:42.066 --> 04:29:45.469 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOOD. AND SO WOULD AND WE

04:29:44.101 --> 04:29:47.371 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOTTEN PAST THAT AT LEAST

04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:49.373 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IN THIS COUNTRY. ALSO

04:29:47.371 --> 04:29:50.307 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE

04:29:49.373 --> 04:29:51.375 region:rollup2
OF US WHO ADULTS.

04:29:50.307 --> 04:29:52.676 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

04:29:51.375 --> 04:29:54.645 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THOSE NEEDS OF EVERY

04:29:52.676 --> 04:29:56.213 region:rollup2
CHILD IS MET. REGARDLESS OF

04:29:54.645 --> 04:29:57.481 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE IN WHAT WE

04:29:56.213 --> 04:29:58.816 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE TRADITIONAL CHARTER

04:29:57.481 --> 04:30:00.718 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC SCHOOL OF THE CHARTER

04:29:58.816 --> 04:30:06.991 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SCHOOL I KIDS DESERVE TO

04:30:00.718 --> 04:30:08.092 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MEAL.

04:30:06.991 --> 04:30:09.160 region:rollup2
MISTER KILEY YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON

04:30:08.092 --> 04:30:09.393 region:rollup2
OR MAYBE IT'S GOOD EVENING WEST

04:30:09.160 --> 04:30:10.661 region:rollup2
POINT.

04:30:09.393 --> 04:30:11.829 region:rollup2
MISTER BONTA.

04:30:10.661 --> 04:30:13.330 region:rollup2
SO THAT INTENTION HERE IS

04:30:11.829 --> 04:30:15.166 region:rollup2
NIGHTLY.

04:30:13.330 --> 04:30:17.301 region:rollup2
GOOD AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT

04:30:15.166 --> 04:30:18.202 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY A. VERY RARE.

04:30:17.301 --> 04:30:19.837 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE.

04:30:18.202 --> 04:30:21.706 region:rollup2
WHERE THIS WOULD EVEN BE

04:30:19.837 --> 04:30:23.774 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TO A SCHOOL ON WHERE IT

04:30:21.706 --> 04:30:25.376 region:rollup2
IS RELEVANT THERE SEEMS A REAL

04:30:23.774 --> 04:30:27.311 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL?

04:30:25.376 --> 04:30:29.780 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTIES THERE BUT.

04:30:27.311 --> 04:30:31.515 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I.I GUESS I GO BACK

04:30:29.780 --> 04:30:33.417 region:rollup2
TO WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A

04:30:31.515 --> 04:30:34.852 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR BILL O. LOOKS LIKE

04:30:33.417 --> 04:30:36.554 region:rollup2
SIX YEARS AGO.

04:30:34.852 --> 04:30:37.888 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT

04:30:36.554 --> 04:30:39.490 region:rollup2
THE THE POINT OF.

04:30:37.888 --> 04:30:41.025 region:rollup2
CHARTERING IS TO HAVE PUBLIC

04:30:39.490 --> 04:30:42.326 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT REGULATED

04:30:41.025 --> 04:30:43.994 region:rollup2
AS PRESCRIPTIVE ONLY AS.

04:30:42.326 --> 04:30:45.563 region:rollup2
AS OTHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE

04:30:43.994 --> 04:30:47.598 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE SAID.

04:30:45.563 --> 04:30:49.300 region:rollup2
CUBAN ATTRITION IS PROFOUNDLY

04:30:47.598 --> 04:30:50.067 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BUT SO ALSO IS THE

04:30:49.300 --> 04:30:51.902 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF CHARTER

04:30:50.067 --> 04:30:53.170 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS THEY BE FREE FROM LARGE

04:30:51.902 --> 04:30:54.538 region:rollup2
PORTIONS OF THE LUMINOUS STATE

04:30:53.170 --> 04:30:55.573 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CODE I'M RELUCTANT TO

04:30:54.538 --> 04:30:57.041 region:rollup2
READ THE INDEPENDENCE AND

04:30:55.573 --> 04:30:58.676 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY. THAT OF WELL SERVE

04:30:57.041 --> 04:31:00.311 region:rollup2
THE FAMILIES AND TEACHERS WHO

04:30:58.676 --> 04:31:02.646 region:rollup2
CHOOSE THEIR CHARTER SCHOOLS SO

04:31:00.311 --> 04:31:04.448 region:rollup2
I DO DISAGREE WITH THE

04:31:02.646 --> 04:31:06.717 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S SENTIMENT.

04:31:04.448 --> 04:31:08.185 region:rollup2
I I DO. I THINK THAT THEY ARE.

04:31:06.717 --> 04:31:08.619 region:rollup2
.

04:31:08.185 --> 04:31:10.020 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS THAT ARE

04:31:08.619 --> 04:31:10.988 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL.

04:31:10.020 --> 04:31:13.124 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD.

04:31:10.988 --> 04:31:14.925 region:rollup2
BE.

04:31:13.124 --> 04:31:16.227 region:rollup2
SHOULD EXIST IN BOTH CHARTER

04:31:14.925 --> 04:31:18.562 region:rollup2
SCHOOL PUBLIC ARTICLES AND AND

04:31:16.227 --> 04:31:20.765 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND.

04:31:18.562 --> 04:31:22.233 region:rollup2
WE'VE AT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

04:31:20.765 --> 04:31:24.034 region:rollup2
I'VE I'VE HAD THAT.

04:31:22.233 --> 04:31:25.636 region:rollup2
A POSITION ON A BILL THAT I'VE

04:31:24.034 --> 04:31:27.171 region:rollup2
BROUGHT FORWARD AND. NOT THE

04:31:25.636 --> 04:31:28.139 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME THAT WE SOUGHT TO

04:31:27.171 --> 04:31:30.074 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE GOVERNOR'S MINE.

04:31:28.139 --> 04:31:30.641 region:rollup2
THAT WE CHANGE THE GOVERNOR'S MY

04:31:30.074 --> 04:31:31.442 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR ON A VERY SIMILAR

04:31:30.641 --> 04:31:33.144 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:31:31.442 --> 04:31:34.111 region:rollup2
THAT HE VETOED IN THE PAST AB

04:31:33.144 --> 04:31:36.680 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN SIXTY.

04:31:34.111 --> 04:31:37.748 region:rollup2
WHERE WE SOUGHT TO HAVE OF SOME

04:31:36.680 --> 04:31:39.416 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONAL FUNDAMENTAL?

04:31:37.748 --> 04:31:40.484 region:rollup2
?

04:31:39.416 --> 04:31:41.352 region:rollup2
EQUITY AND FAIRNESS POLICIES

04:31:40.484 --> 04:31:43.320 region:rollup2
AROUND ADMISSIONS

04:31:41.352 --> 04:31:45.055 region:rollup2
AND DISCIPLINE.

04:31:43.320 --> 04:31:46.423 region:rollup2
AND I WE WORK THE TART SCHOOL SO

04:31:45.055 --> 04:31:47.792 region:rollup2
SHE ACTION VERY CLOSELY WE FOUND

04:31:46.423 --> 04:31:49.660 region:rollup2
COMMON GROUND THEY ENDED UP

04:31:47.792 --> 04:31:50.461 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THE BILL. WILL DO THE

04:31:49.660 --> 04:31:51.862 region:rollup2
SAME THING HERE WERE NOT THERE

04:31:50.461 --> 04:31:53.397 region:rollup2
TODAY WHEN THE FIRST HOUSE THE

04:31:51.862 --> 04:31:54.999 region:rollup2
FIRST COMMITTEE. I BUT I THINK

04:39:32.589 --> 04:39:36.159 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT MORE GOING ON.

04:39:34.224 --> 04:39:37.594 region:rollup2
AFTER MUCH PUSHING I FINALLY GOT

04:39:36.159 --> 04:39:39.997 region:rollup2
A REFERRAL TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST

EVERYTHING WILL FALL INTO PLACE.

04:40:03.820 --> 04:40:06.957 region:rollup2

05:07:30.432 --> 05:07:33.502 region:rollup2
THEY DO.

05:07:32.367 --> 05:07:35.037 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SEE THE

05:07:33.502 --> 05:07:36.838 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION SO THAT AUTHORIZING.

05:07:35.037 --> 05:07:38.040 region:rollup2

THAT.

05:07:47.249 --> 05:07:49.618 region:rollup2

05:07:49.618 --> 05:07:52.220 region:rollup2
