PERSONALLY APPRISED OF THE

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.558
DETAILS OF THIS ISSUE REALLY A

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.360
FEW HOURS AGO I HAD BEEN HEARD

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:48.394
A FEW DAYS AGO THERE MIGHT BE

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.762
SOME QUESTIONS SAID BEEN

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.130
EXPECTING A PHONE CALL THE

WEEKEND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:54.000
WE ARE TODAY. A FEW THINGS IT

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.401
IS NOT BEEN OUR INTENT TO

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.303
TARGET AND TAX RESIDENTIAL

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.871
DEVELOPMENT WHAT I UNDERSTAND

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.039
WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO IS TO

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:02.575
CARVE OUT OF THE APPLICATION OF

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:05.478
GENERAL TAXES FOR A SPECIFIC

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:06.779
SEGMENT THAT IS REPRESENTED BY

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.614
BY MR GUNNING AND I WILL SAY A

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:10.216
FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT FIRST

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:13.119
THIS BILL HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.186
INTENSE DISCUSSION AROUND THE

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.988
BAY AND HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.723
A PORTION OF THIS IS VERY LAST

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.624
MINUTE WHAT I'D COMMITTED TO

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:21.060
THE PUBLIC WAS TO WORK VERY

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.795
CLOSELY WITH A BAG AN EMPTY SEE

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:23.796
ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:26.098
ACCEPTING TODAY. THIS IS SIMPLY

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.667
JUST NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.368
DISCUSSED I WISH THAT WE'VE HAD

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:30.636
TIME BUT BUT BUT WE DON'T

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.772
SECONDLY EIGHT THERE WAS A

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:34.707
SUGGESTION ABOUT WHAT WAS

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.509
DISCUSSED AT CASA AND

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.144
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WAS

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.079
DISCUSSED ACOSTA OR NOT THIS IS

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.480
THIS IS A STAND ALONE BILL THIS

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.849
BILL IS FRANKLY THAT MANY MANY

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:44.951
ELEMENTS OF IT ARE VERY

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:46.752
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT CASA WAS

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:51.057
ABOUT BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:51.924
THAT POINT AND THEN I WOULD

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.559
JUST AND WITH. ITS TYPICALLY

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:56.529
VERY UNPRECEDENTED TO CARVE UT

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.764
AN INDUSTRY FROM AGAIN GENERAL

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.967
TAXATION I THINK WE SHOULDN'T

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.436
DO THAT LATELY I DO THINK

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.303
THERE'S A CONVERSATION WE HAD

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.471
AND I JUST WILL AND WITH THIS

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.039
POINT WHICH IS IT'S NOT MY

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.774
INTENT THAT IF THERE REVENUES

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.842
TO BE RAISED IN THE BAY AREA

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.410
FOR HOUSING THAT WE DO IT IN A

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:18.818
WAY THAT WOULD SOMEHOW. IMPEDE

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:19.418
NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THAT

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:24.924
WOULD BE. COMPLETELY

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.592
COUNTERINTUITIVE SO I THINK WE-

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:27.193
SHARE THE SAME GOALS WHAT I

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:28.828
TOLD MR GOING. I IS IF WE DON'T

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:29.862
HAVE TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE MAN

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:30.396
THAT THAT MAKES SENSE ALL

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.030
PARTIES I THINK THAT WOULD BE

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.431
VERY DIFFICULT. THAT I WE WOULD

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:33.032
BE WILLING IF WE CAN GET TO AN

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:34.100
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS. TO

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.301
CONSIDER A LETTER TO THE

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:36.802

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.404

GET THERE BUT- THOSE ARE MY

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.045
COMMENTS. AND I APPRECIATE THAT

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:47.179

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.434
FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT. THIS

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.802

HOME CONSTRUCTION OR-

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:30.749
SIGNIFICANT. ADDITIONS TO YOU

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:34.586
I'M JUST. THE CARD EXACTLY THE

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.755
TYPE OF THING WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.757
THE OTHER WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:42.661
TRYING TO BOTH FACILITATE GREEN

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.731
LIGHT AND STREAMLINE HOUSING BY

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.700
EITHER TRYING TO CAPPER LIMIT

FEES OR GIVE SOME TAX

00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:53.405
EXEMPTIONS AND SUCH AS FAR AS I

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:55.374
CAN TELL THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.309
TIED THE HANDS OF THE BACK ROOM

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.144
AND TO SEE IN TERMS OF PUTTING

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:02.514
IN. THE KIND OF EXEMPTION THAT

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.883
WILL BE A MIGHT BE ADVOCATING

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.285
FOR CORRECT YOU ARE ENTIRELY

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:08.987
CORRECT OKAY SO GIVEN THAT IN

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:12.357
AYE I APPRECIATE THEIR RAISING

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:17.830
THE POINT. BECAUSE I THINK IT

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:19.731
AT LEAST I IS A BAY AREA MEMBER

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:20.365
ESPECIALLY ONE WHERE I KNOW WE

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.434
HAVE CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:23.702
COST TO CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.370
ANYWHERE BUT THE BERRY HAS EVEN

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.572
HIGHER COST OF CONSTRUCTION AND

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:28.040
THE REST TO CALIFORNIA. SO

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:30.209
CLEARLY WE DON'T WANT TO ADD

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:36.181
ANYTHING TO. TWO MAKING IT

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.584
WORSE AND WE ALREADY ARE SEEING

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.386
NOW ON WOULD YOU CALL IT

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.889
PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT HAVE

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.257
PERMITS ARE FULLY ENTITLED

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:46.758
ENORMOUS NOT STARTING

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:48.393
CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE AGAIN

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.361
THEY'RE FINANCING IS IT'S JUST

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:52.097
NOT MAKING SENSE RIGHT. SO

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.333
ANYWAY SO MY POINT BEING THAT.

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.535
THE BILL STILL ALLOWS FOR WHAT

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:59.671
WAS ADVOCATED WITHOUT OUR

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:02.140
HAVING TO AMEND OR FIX IT. NOW

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:05.511
SECONDARILY. I AM GLAD THAT IT

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:11.517
DOES NOT. MY I'M TIRED FROM THE

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:12.284
LONG DAY LC DICTATE I DON'T

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:13.819
USUALLY WOULDN'T USUALLY USE

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.487
THAT TERM BUT IT DOESN'T

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:18.257
DICTATE WHAT TYPES OF REVENUE

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.459

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:22.594
AROUND YEAR ROUND YOU CAN HERE

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:25.163
ARE WHAT YOU HAVE OPTION FOR

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.797
BUT IT DOESN'T DICTATE YOU MUST

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:28.634
DO THIS WHEN YOU MUST DO THAT

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.201
ONE. AND I'M VERY GLAD ABOUT

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:31.904
THAT BECAUSE- ONE OF THE THINGS

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:32.504
THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.140
LOT OF SALES TAX. AND WE'VE GOT

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:36.942

TRANSPORTATION MEASURES AND WE-

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.787
AND A CERTAIN POINT AND- I

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.523
PROBABLY ALREADY. WE ARE BEYOND

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.659
WHAT WE CAN HANDLE SALES TAX SO

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:55.227
I'M VERY GLAD IT DOESN'T

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.995
DICTATE IT BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:19:57.062 --> 00:20:00.332

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:28.720
PROBLEMATIC AND SO CLEARLY

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:29.488
THERE WILL BE LOVERS AND HAVING

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.523
THOSE DISCUSSIONS LOCALLY. BUT

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.993
I DO I DON'T WANT IT TO GET

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.863
LOST BY THE LATE OPPOSITION.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:39.331
THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE. YOU

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:45.037
KNOW IN IN OURS. ONE OF THE

00:21:45.103 --> 00:21:45.570
CHALLENGES WE HAVE AROUND

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:49.775
HOUSING. IS THAT. WE DON'T TAX

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:52.511
LONG TERM. PROPERTY OWNERS THE

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:54.446
OTHER PASS. DRAMATICALLY REDUCE

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:56.715
PROPERTY TAXES AND WHAT WE END

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:59.117
UP TAXING IS. ODD BOTH OUR NEW

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:01.053
RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:02.654
DOCKETS HEAVILY TAXED VIA AND

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.755
IMPACT FEES AND THE NEW

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.023
HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE THEY GOT TAX

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.891
THE MARKET RATE UNDER PROP

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:07.392
THIRTEEN. SO WE HAVE THIS

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.761
SYSTEM WHERE WE YOU KNOW SAY

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:12.064
NEW HOMEOWNERS THE TAX LAW AND

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.365
HOMES THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:14.299
PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM YET. THE

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:16.835
TAX LAW. AND SO IT IS IT IS A

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:19.671
REAL ISSUE AND SO AGAIN THANK

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:20.572
THE AUTHOR FOR GREEN TO

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:27.379
CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. AND.

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:27.979
WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:28.547
COMMENTS JUST CENTER MICHAEL

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:34.619
SKI. THE BEARER PERSON ALL

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.455
MOVED TO THE MEASURE BUT I

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.657
WANTED TO DRIVE OUR ATTENTION

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:44.196
BACK TO PAGE THIRTEEN BECAUSE.

00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:44.730
FOUR SIX FOUR SIX FOUR SIX

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:47.666
HUNDRED. HE SEE SAYS IT'S THE

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.768
INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT

00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:50.569
THE FUNDING AS THE CHAIR POINTS

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:51.703
OUT SHE COME FROM COMMERCIAL

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.704
DEVELOPERS BUSINESSES OF

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.406
CERTAIN SIZE TAXPAYERS AND

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:55.741
PROPERTY OWNERS ACROSS THE

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:58.877
REGION SO AGAIN IT SEEMS TO ME

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:02.447
THAT IT THE MEASURE ELOQUENTLY

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:03.715
GIVES THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAY

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:06.685
BANK AND AN MTC THE AUTHORITY

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:08.920
THAT THE TO PUT ON A MEASURE

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:10.222
HOWEVER THEY STRUCTURE THAT

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:11.957
WHICH IS WE LIKE TO HAVE THAT

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:15.327
LOCAL CONTROL IN IT DOESN'T

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:18.430
BALI BUT IT AND- IT LAYS OUT

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:19.765
THE INTENT WHICH DOESN'T

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:22.334
INCLUDE WHAT THIS LETTER SAYS

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.769
ARE LOOPHOLES IT DOESN'T

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:25.036
INCLUDE ANY THAT THERE'S A

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:30.342
SINGLE. TAX NEW CONSTRUCTION IT.

00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:30.942
SPECIFICALLY DOESN'T CALL THAT

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:35.947
OUT SO. I KNOW THIS IS A LATE

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:37.783
HOUR I DON'T WHEN I READ THE

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:38.383
OPPOSITION LETTER AND I READ

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.451
THAT PLAIN TEXT AND I KNOW THAT

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:40.852
THE PROCESS IS FOR. THE

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:41.453
REGIONAL AGENCIES TO PUT THIS

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.724
ON. AM I MISSING HERE

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.393
ASSEMBLYMEMBER THESE DO YOU SEE

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:48.860
ANYWHERE IN HERE THIS

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:52.030
SPECIFICALLY CALLS OUT FOR NEW

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:52.764
CONSTRUCTION TO FOOT THE BILL

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:54.633
HERE FOR THE EAST FOR A HOUSING

00:23:54.699 --> 00:23:56.368
DEVELOPMENT I DON'T AND THAT'S

00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:57.602
WHY I AM STILL FRANKLY AS I'VE

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:59.104
EXPRESSED TO SEE A STILL A

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:00.672
LITTLE MYSTIFIED AS TO EXACTLY

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.007
WHAT THE OBJECTION IS BECAUSE

00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:03.809
WE ARE NOT SAYING IN THIS BILL

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:05.377
THEY'LL SHELL TAX RESIDENTIAL

00:24:05.443 --> 00:24:09.347
DEVELOPERS. WERE ST WE MAY TAX

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:09.948
BUSINESSES OVER CERTAIN SIZE

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:10.715
TAXPAYERS PROPERTY OWNERS

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.851
EXCEPT TRUCK BUT WERE NOT

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:14.452
SPECIFICALLY TAXING THAT ENTITY

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:16.721
BUT THEIR CONCERN IS IF THEY'RE

00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:18.156
NOT SPECIFICALLY CARVED OUT FOR

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.991
MORE GENERAL TAX THAT THEY

00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:21.726
WOULD BE BEARING ATTACKS THAT

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:24.362
IS GONNA BE APPLIED GENERALLY.

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:25.430
I THINK IT'S A CONVERSATION WE

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:26.998
CAN HAVE AN AGAIN AS I SAID I

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:28.200
REMEMBER ONE HAVE IT IF WE

00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:29.868
BELIEVE AS THE CHAIRMAN HAS

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:31.369
INDICATED THAT THEY'RE ALREADY

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:34.172
OVERTAXED WITH THOSE ARGUMENTS

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:34.806
BE COMPELLING IN FRONT OF HIM

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:37.375
TO SEE IN A BAG WHEN THEY WERE

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:39.477
CONSIDERING A REGIONAL TAP I

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.780
THINK IT VERY WELL COULD AND AS

00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:43.481
THE GOOD CENTER FOR BERKELEY

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.283
POINTED OUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.184
DISCUSSION THAT CAN HAPPEN

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.986
BETWEEN A BAG AND THE FTC WHEN

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.888
THEY CONSIDER. WHAT THEY WANTED

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:50.722
TO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE NOT BE

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:52.624
PRESCRIPTIVE WERE PROVIDING A

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:53.992
NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND ALSO JUST

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:55.126
BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AS CENTER

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:57.662
SKINNER SAID ALLUDED TO WE

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:58.697
SPECIFICALLY TOOK OUT THE SALES

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:00.098
TAX IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.100
BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM ALL OF

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.034
COUNTIES THAT THAT IS NOT AN

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:08.773
OPTION THEY WANT TO PROVIDE. TO

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.307
THE NIGHT COUNTY REGION SO

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:16.348
MOVING TRAIL. OKAY WITH MOTION

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:18.516
THAT. QUESTIONS ABOUT YES AND

00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:21.953
REBATES. YEAH HI I'M- LOOKING

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:28.960
AT PAGE THIRTEEN AND. SO I

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:31.396
WOULDN'T THINK THAT BE I A IS

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:33.231
NOT FAR OFF YOU OF THIS

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:36.167
PARTICULAR STATEMENT IN THE

00:25:36.234 --> 00:25:37.269
INTENT SAYS PROPERTY OWNERS

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:39.537
WITHIN THE REGION. THOSE COULD

00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:40.705
BE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:41.940
ENTITLEMENTS RESIDENTIAL

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:44.242
DEVELOPMENT AND THEREFORE THEY

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:46.278
WOULD BE SUBJECT BILL LEFT AT

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:47.545
THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'RE GONNA

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:50.048
SPECIFICALLY BE CARVED OUT. AND

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:54.119
THAT'S A LOT OF. THAT'S A LOT

00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:56.054
OF FAITH TO PUT IN AN ODD TO

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:56.955
WHAT GOES ON AT LOCAL

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:57.589
GOVERNMENTS EXCUSE ME AND I'VE

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:58.189
THOUGHT ON THEM FOR YEARS AND

00:25:58.256 --> 00:25:59.824
YEARS. SO I THINK THEY HAVE A

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:02.227
LEGITIMATE CONCERN OVER THAT

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:02.827
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED GOING

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:05.697
FORWARD SECONDLY. I THINK THAT

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:07.732
MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARSH TO BE

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:08.733
JUMPING ALL OVER THEM WHEN IN

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.302
THEIR OWN LETTER. ARE THEY THEY

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:12.470
SAY THAT IN JULY THEY RAISE

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:15.774
CONCERNS ABOUT. WHAT WAS BEING

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.143
BROUGHT FORWARD SO I'M NOT I AM

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:19.678
JUST SAYING I THINK TONIGHT YOU

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:21.379
GUYS BEEN A LOT OF TIME A LOT

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:23.248
OF COMPROMISE CONVERSATIONS.

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:24.983
BUT I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.085
ASKING AND MAYBE IT IS A LITTLE

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:28.153
TOO LATE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:30.355
AMENDMENTS CAME. WERE PUT INTO

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:31.389
THE BILL AND WHEN THEY HAVE THE

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:33.158
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEM. BUT I

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.059
THINK THEY RAISE SERIOUS

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:39.597
CONCERNS HOW THIS CAN BE.

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:40.165
MANAGED WHEN HE GETS OUT TO

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:45.170
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND HOW IT'S

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:45.770
ADDRESSED BY THE PARTNERS TO

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:50.342
DOUBT. TO THOSE. AREAS LOCAL

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:50.909
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND I'VE

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:54.279
THIRD. PROBABLY TOO LONG TWENTY

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:54.879
TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF LOCAL

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:56.081
GOVERNMENT LEVELS THESE ARE

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:57.449
THINGS THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT

00:26:57.515 --> 00:26:58.683
THAT KIND OF A LOOPHOLE YOU

00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:59.751
JUST KIND OF PUT YOUR FORTUNE

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:00.452
ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF A

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:01.019
BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.253
SHARE THE SAME. CONCERNS THAT

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.556
YOU HAVE REGARDING PROPERTY

00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:05.590
RIGHTS THAT YOU CURRENTLY WERE

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:07.325
GIVEN THREE YEAR ENTITLEMENT SO

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.594
I JUST THROW THAT OUT FOR A

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:11.663
DISCUSSION AND MAYBE GOING FOR

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.465
WE DO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:16.901
THAT TO NOT I COULDN'T SUPPORT

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:17.535
IT. VERY YOU KNOW BASED ON THAT

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:21.906
ALONE. APPRECIATE THE

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:22.507
PERSPECTIVE ALSO A FEW THINGS

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:24.476
JUST SIMPLE PROCESS. I DO

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:26.511
UNDERSTAND THERE WAS. THERE WAS

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:27.145
RELEASED A CONVERSATION TO WITH

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:28.680
MY STAFF. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.714
SAY THERE WERE SOME

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:30.749
MISUNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN BOTH

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:31.750
SIDES OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.451
GET OUT. IT WASN'T REYES WITH

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:36.654
ME I AND- AND THE CHAIRMAN OF

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.757
THIS COMMITTEE SOME REQUIRED I

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:40.458
WE WERE ALL VERY DEEPLY GAUGE

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:41.860
FOR MANY MANY MONTHS AND NO AND

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:42.927
IT BROUGHT IT TO. TO OUR

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:43.828
ATTENTION BUT PUT THE PUTTING

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:45.463
THAT ASIDE. IN ALSO APPRECIATE

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.731
YOUR POINT AROUND PROPERTY

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:48.099
OWNERS AROUND THE REGION YES IT

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.534
IS POSSIBLE. THAT CITY I

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.336
MEMBERS COULD BE IN THAT

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:53.204
SUBSET. I THINK THE POINT HERE

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:54.773
IS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CAR

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.474
ABOUT. OF ANY THESE GENERAL

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.810
TAXES BECAUSE OF THIS LENGTHY

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:00.545
PROCESS WE WENT THROUGH. THAT

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:01.846
CARVING OUT ONE INDUSTRY IS

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:03.415
LIKE PULLING OUT THE STRING.

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:05.016
BECAUSE EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:05.884
SECTOR THAT DOESN'T WANT YOU

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.452
TAX WILL BE ASKING FOR THE SAME

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:08.920
THING AND SO THE IDEA WAS. WE

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:10.688
THOUGHT WAS FAIRLY SAY GIVE THE

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:11.656
REGION THE OPTION CONSUMER

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:13.758
GENERAL TAX. IT'S UP TO THEM TO

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:14.859
DECIDE WHO IT WOULD APPLY TO

00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:15.927
AND THAT IS THE INTENT. BUT

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:16.961
THAT BEING SAID YOUR FIRST

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:18.363
POINT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.963
ENGAGE IN THIS COUNTRY SO I

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.365
WOULD JUST ASK THAT WHEN YOU'RE

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:22.067
TALKING ABOUT PROPERTY OWNERS

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:23.935
WHO HAVE CURRENT ENTITLEMENTS

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.737
FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL.

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:27.405
THAT HAS TO BE DISCUSSED OR

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:29.240

00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:32.010
HERE. SPECIFICALLY AND- YOU

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.445
KNOW GENERALLY. THERE'S NO

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.213
QUESTION BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.749
THAT CURRENTLY. HAVE ZONING ON

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.317
THOSE PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.553
IN YOUR REGION. THEY CURRENTLY

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:42.587
HAVE ENTITLEMENTS. THIS EITHER

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:49.427
COMMERCIAL. FOR IS GOING TO BE

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:54.165
RESIDENTIAL MY THE MULTI FAMILY.

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:55.400
BUT IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.702
TAXING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES.

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:58.770
AND THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE NOT

00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:00.605
GOING TO BE INCLUDED. THAT

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:01.206
WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU'D USE THE

00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:03.174
ENTITLEMENT APPROACH. HI

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.276
BECAUSE YOU CAN. YOU KNOW AND

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:07.912
THAT WAS ONLY CAN CHANGE. BUT

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:08.513
SERIOUSLY THAT LEFT THAT'S A

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.515
HUGE LOOPHOLE IN A BY. I'M JUST

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:11.516
THINKING ABOUT THE LAST MAJOR

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:12.917
DEVELOPMENT OF SOUTH. COUNTY IS

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:15.186
CALLED THE RANCH. YET IT HAS

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.654
ENTITLEMENTS FOR. HER SO I

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:17.455
REMEMBER THIS RIGHT JOHN IS

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:18.890
ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.558
AND THERE'S MULTI FAMILY.

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.327
THERE'S COMMERCIAL WITHIN THAT

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:23.061
THAT IS ALL SET OUT IN A MAJOR

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:23.728
GENERAL PLAN IF YOU WOULD

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.063
EXPECT. WELL IF THAT YOU KNOW

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.364
THINKING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO

TAX THAT MANY SINGLE FAMILY

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:27.899
RESIDENTIAL HOMES IN THAT HUGE

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:29.801
DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE SHE WANTED

MORE AFFORDABLE OR WHATEVER TO

00:29:30.768 --> 00:29:32.403

THEY'VE GOT HEALTH SOME

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.877
PREDICTABILITY. AND I THINK
