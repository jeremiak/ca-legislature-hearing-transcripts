SPREADING OF THIS PANDEMIC DISCONNECTING POPULATIONS CAN'T APPLY FOR JOBS ONLINE NO JOBS. AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF VIOLENCE INCREASE FATHER BOYLE SAID THIS GIVE A MAN A WOMAN A JOB YOU STOP A BULLET.

TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE ON CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET AND HAVING BROADBAND SERVICE 49% OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION ARE NOT CONNECTED 35% OF NON ENGLISH SPEAKING LATINO POPULATIONS ARE NOT CONNECTED UNDER CONNECTED SIXTY TWO PERCENT.

UNFORTUNATELY OF WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT BILL THROUGH HOWEVER YOU DID APPROPRIATE A LOT OF MONEY THAT IS AVAILABLE WHAT WE'RE COMING TO YOU TO S. TODAY WITH TWENTY SEVEN OH TWO IT'S JUST PRIORITIZE THE FUNDING TO PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COMPLEXES THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED SUCH COMPLEXES IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT AND AT LEAST 40% OF THOSE RESIDENTS ARE NOT CONNECTED AND HAVE NO ACCESS. TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE. IN MISTER GIBSON'S DISTRICT OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- OVER HALF 50% OF THEIR COMPLEX IT'S STILL ARE NOT CONNECTED WITH HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE. WE KNOW THESE THESE- COMPLEXES JORDON DOWNS- MAR VISTA GARDENS NICKERSON- IN FRESNO- THE HOUSING AUTHORITY AT LEAST HALF OF THOSE COMPLEXES ARE NOT CONNECTED. SO IN CONCLUSION LET ME JUST SAY OUT OF ALL OF THE AMAZING COMMITMENT YOU'VE MADE AS THE LEGISLATURE TO BROADBAND GETTING PEOPLE CONNECTED. IN TEN YEARS NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN MILLION HAS ACTUALLY GONE TO THOSE PEOPLE AND PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THAT ARE THE MOST IMPOVERISHED THERE THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS BY DEFINITION THAT IS HOW THEY QUALIFY TO LIVE IN A GOVERNMENT HOUSING AUTHORITY OR NONPROFIT. OR DOUBLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

ALL THEM HOLDEN I LO LOW AYE MAIENSCHEIN. RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I L. DERIS BUILDERS I DOCTOR WEBER DR WEBER I'M THE BILLS OUT AND WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN. ALL RIGHT THAT THAT TAKES US TO AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC ADVOCATES CONCERNS. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT WILL UPDATE AN ADDRESS PERSISTENT ISSUES WITH THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND VIDEO COMPETITION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX ALSO KNOWN AS DIFFICULT. DIFFICULT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN COURAGE COMPETITION IN THE CABLE MARKET WITH THE INTENT OF BENEFITING CONSUMERS BY LOWERING PRICES IN PROMOTING THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES. SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS APPROACH SELF REGULATING OF THE INDUSTRY THROUGH COMPETITION HAS FAILED. THERE'S LESS COMPETITION IN THE MARKET PLACE THAN EVER AND ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND HOME STATEWIDE REMAIN COMPLETELY UNSERVED BY INTERNET AND BROADBAND SERVICES. THAT MEANS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC THESE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES COULD NOT ACCESS REMOTE SCHOOLING WORK FROM HOME OPTIONS HEALTH TELEHEALTH ONLINE APPLICATIONS FOR ASSISTANCE THEY QUALIFY FOR AND MORE. AND ANNOUNCED INCONVENIENT AND INEQUITABLE OBSTACLE FOR MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. THE PANDEMIC HAS PROVEN THAT ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES ARE NOT JUST FOR ENTERTAINMENT BUT ARE ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR SURVIVAL. SO EQUAL ACCESS IS A CRUCIAL PUBLIC INTEREST FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS REMAIN UNDERSERVED OR COMPLETELY UNSERVED DUE TO DIGITAL REDLINING UNEQUAL PRICING AND TERMS THAT UNFAIRLY DISADVANTAGE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. IN MY OWN DISTRICT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A CONSTITUENT FOR FOUR YEARS REGARDING THEIR PERSONAL ISSUES WITH RECEIVING FIBER INTERNET IN THEIR HOME TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS. DESPITE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEING PRESENT AND AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE SAME FIBER INTERNET TO NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES MY CAN TO AND HAS BEEN BIG EXPLANATIONS FROM PROVIDERS ON WHY HIS BUSINESS DOES NOT QUALIFY TO RECEIVE FIBER INTERNET DESPITE. THE PRESIDENT INFRASTRUCTURE. UNFORTUNATELY MY CONSTITUENTS SCENARIO IS NOT AN OUT LIAR WHICH MAKES THE NEED FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT MORE URGENT. THIS BILL WILL SEEK TO REMEDY THESE ISSUES BY UPDATING DISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND GRADING ALL POTENTIAL AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS WITH A RIGHT TO EQUAL ACCESS TO SERVICES ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE WITHIN FRANCHISE HOLDERS SERVICE TERRITORIES ARE RECEIVING EQUAL ACCESS. AND RATES OF SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WILL ADOPT DEF THE DEFINITION OF DO DIGITAL DISCRIMINATION USED IN FEDERAL POLICY AND GRAB THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WITH THE SAME AUTHORITY THEY WOULD HAVE. UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO ENFORCE THE BUILD OUT OF VIDEO AND CABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. BY DOING SO WE CAN BRING THIS NEARLY TWO DECADES OLD POLICY UP TO DATE STANDARDS AND EXTEND CABLE VIDEO AND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE TO HOMES THAT CURRENTLY LACK THE NECESSARY CONNECTIONS TO RECEIVE THE SERVICE. FINALLY THIS BILL WILL RENAME DIFFICULT. TO THE DIGITAL EQUITY IN VIDEO-FRANCHISING ACT. OR DEFY. THE HIGHLIGHT THE ULTIMATE POLICY GOAL OF THIS BILL EQUITY IN ACCESS TO VITAL SERVICES. I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT TOOK PLACE TO ESTABLISH DIFFICULT FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND WITH MY CAN COLLEAGUES SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE CAN USE OUR PLATFORM TO UPDATED TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS TODAY. OUR PREDECESSORS WHO CREATED DIFFICULT COULD NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. ACCELERATING THE TRANSITION OF MANY ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO ONLINE TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS CAN WITHSTAND ANOTHER GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND MAINTAIN INTER CONNECTED TO. THE INTERCONNECTED THIS THROUGH EQUAL ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES. ON THE LINE AND I ALSO HEAR A PERSON ALONG- IS A SUPPORT OF FROM- ANNA TERESA DE HAND AND WITH GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOW AND TRACY ROSENBERG WITH MEDIA ALLIANCE. HI THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. AND JUST CHECKING IN DO YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS YES I'D- OUR FIRST TESTIMONY THANK YOU CHAIR AND THINK YOU MEMBERS MY NAME IS I'M NOT THAT I SAID THE HONDA NAME BE SENIOR DIRECTOR ADEQUATE PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOW A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. THAT FOCUSES ON IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTCOMES FOR LOS ANGELES CHILDREN OF COLOR AND THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY. AS OPPOSED TRANSITION BACK AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF COVERT RELATED DISRUPTIONS IT'S CRITICAL THAT ALL OF US EDUCATORS PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS STAY FOCUSED ON AND DEEM. THE INEQUITIES OF THE PANDEMIC EXPOSED AND EXACERBATED IN PUBLIC EDUCATION ONE OF THE MOST URGENT INEQUITIES IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ANGELES FAMILIES WE LEARNED THAT CHALLENGES ACCESSING THE INTERNET AT HOME. THE TWO BIGGEST REASONS THEY SHARED OUR THAT THE INTERNET IS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE AND INTERNET ACCESS THAT IS AFFORDABLE IS TOO POOR QUALITY TO MEET THEIR FAMILY NEEDS. IN CALIFORNIA OVER 25% OF K. TWELVE STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE RELIABLE INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME. AND 10% OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS RELYING ON SMARTPHONES TO ACCESS THE INTERNET. THIS MEANS THAT WEALTHIER STUDENTS WHOSE FAMILIES LIVE IN AREAS WITH BETTER BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE AN EASIER TIME APPLYING FOR COLLEGE FINING IN AND ROLLING IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND DOING THEIR HOMEWORK. AS A RESULT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THERE ARE MANY RESOURCES. FOR THE PANDEMIC RECOVERY THAT BLACK AND LATINO AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO. EVERY FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EQUAL SERVICE WITH EQUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS NOT SERVICE THAT IS DIFFERENTIATED ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND NOT PRICE SCENE IN TERMS THAT ARE BETTER FOR WEALTHY COMMUNITIES THAN FOR LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS IS WHY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT REFORMING AND UPDATING THE NEARLY TWO DECADES OLD POLICY THAT REGULATES THE STATE'S LARGEST INTERNET SERVICE COMPANIES. TO REQUIRE EQUAL ACCESS IT'S NECESSARY AND URGENT IT IS A NECESSARY AND URGENT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLD THEM AND COCHAIR QUIRK-SILVA FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF MY NAME IS TRACY. ROSENBERG I'M THE DIRECTOR OF MEDIA ALLIANCE WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC COMMUNICATIONS ADVOCATE AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT UPDATES A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BELL. DIFFICULTY WHICH MOVED CABLE FRANCHISING FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCESS TO THE CPUC IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN WE MADE THE FIRST SMALL CHECK IMAGE TO. DAVE BECAUSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WITH SB TWENTY EIGHT BY SENATOR CABALLERO IN ASSIGNING MESSAGE GOVERNMENT. GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID I ENCOURAGE THE- LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER GOING FURTHER IT HAS BEEN FIFTEEN YEARS. INSTEAD OF CA AND THE EXISTING STATUTE IS OUTDATED. WE AGREE STATE CABLE FRANCHISES CARI NUDE EVERY TEN YEARS THE CURRENT PROCESS RUBBER STAMPS A WHAT'S THE APPLICANT IS VIOLATING A NON APPEALABLE COURT ORDER THAT IS A VERY LOW BAR THIS PREVENTS THE STATE FROM WORKING ON DIGITAL EQUITY GOALS AND- DEALING WITH PROBLEMS LIKE LACK OF ACCESS OR REDLINING. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT BALANCES OUT THE RECORDS D. REGULATORY PROCESS SO IT ISN'T ONE SIDED AND CAN CONSIDER IMPORTANT PRIORITIES AS DEFINED IN THE BILL TO PROMOTE WIDESPREAD ACCESS TO THE MOST TECHNICAL TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED CABLE AND VIDEO SERVICES TO ALL CALIFORNIANS IN A NON. THE DISCRIMINATORY MANNER REGARDLESS OF SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS IF THAT'S OUR GOAL AND THE STATE PROCESS TO USE THE PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY NEEDS O REFLECT THOSE GOALS AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT IS NOT HEAVY HANDED IT SIMPLY EMPOWERS THE STATE TO. DELIVER ON ITS DIGITAL EQUITY PROMISES TO CALIFORNIANS BY NOT IGNORING EQUITY WHEN ISSUING STATE FRANCHISES THIS IS LONG OVERDUE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE WILL NOW INVITE- THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT. TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE. OH I'M SORRY I'M RUSHING AT SORRY EVERYBODY. WE NEED OUR WITNESSES- FIRST IN SUPPORT A WE JUST AN ART WE NEED OUR OPPOSITION WITNESSES SORRY. SO WE WERE ASK OUR OPPOSITION WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF BERNIE OROZCO CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION- WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S- INTENTIONS HERE TO PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT AND ATTEMPT TO DO. WE ARE HOWEVER STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND ANNUAL PRIMARILY YOU'RE YOU'RE USING A VIDEO FRANCHISING LAW TO GO AFTER BROADBAND SO YOU'RE TAKING A CODE SECTION THAT WAS INTENDED TO STREAMLINE THE COMPETITION A VIDEO SERVICE SO WHEN SOMEONE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE YOUKNOW IT'S A QUICK PROCESS FOR RENEWALS THAT IS BY DESIGN SO. WHEN LLOYD LEVINE AND- FARBEYOND WHEN YES SPONSORED THIS LEGISLATION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WAS FOR THAT PURPOSE BECAUSE OF THE- PROCESS WITH HEAVY NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT WHAT HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY HOW MUCH PAY CHANNELS YOU PROVIDE- YOU KNOW WHAT ACCESS YOU GIVE TO FIRE STATIONS YOU KNOW SCHOOLS. SO IF PARA SAYS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ALL THAT PROCESS AND JUST SAY YOU GET 5% OF YOUR GROSS RECEIPTS FOR- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GET YOU. FOR USE. WE DESIGNED TO BE A VERY SMOOTH IS A PROCESS FOR- APPLICATIONS AND RENEWALS. FOR VIDEO SERVICE SO NOW WE'RE TRYING TO USE- THIS FLAW THOUGH FOR BROADBAND. AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE CONTRARY TO DIFFICULT THIS WILL NOW GIVE THE PC LONG LENGTH THE AUTHORITY TO HAVE LONG PROCEEDINGS TO LOOK AT YOUR DEPLOYMENT. FOR BROADBAND IN A VIDEO FRANCHISE AT LAW. AND THE CONCERN WITH THAT IS THAT. AGAIN IT WAS NEVER. DO THAT BAD THAT WHEN DID RULES ARE BEING DESIGNED FOR DEAF GOT. THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE PC TO DO WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. AND THE P. YOU SEE SAID NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS LAWS DESIGNED TO DO. AND WHAT WOULD BE EVERY TEN YEARS TO BRING IN A FIVE AND- PARTIALLY SERVICE THIS FOR NOT HI IT'S SO DON'T WAIT TEN YEAR THAT OVER SHOULD BE ON AND CONSTANT SO WE WERE CONCERNED THIS YOU EXPANSION OF THOR TO THE P. AND- IT'S CON TO THE SIR THAT PROVIDED IN DIFF- THE NEW AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE- THAT WOULD GIVE THE YOU SEE THE TORTURED ANY OF NEW REQUIRED THIS BENNY KIND OF SRE OF STRICT OUT AT THE THING WE AVOID IT BACK INTO THE SIX. SO WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR- WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS- WE KNOW WE AGAIN SUPPORT EQUAL ACCESS BORN IN. NEW UPDATED AND OF BERRY TO DEPLOY. THAT THIS BILL RE. SOBRE TO THAT THE- BARE THOSE I DO BERRIES ARE RESTORED IF IT EXPANSION OF THE PC ON SOMETHING THAT WAS PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO BE STREAMLINED. THANK YOU NEXT WAS WITNESSED CAROLINE BILL HUNTER SLOW HIS JENSEN AND ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF DIRECT TV. DIRECT TV ALSO OPPOSES AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT. AND WHILE WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO PROVIDE EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR ALL AND TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE VIDEO AND BROADBAND MARKETPLACE. THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY FAILED TO CONSOLE THE UNIQUE STRUCTURE OF THE DIRECT TV UNIVERSE RELATIONSHIP WHAT DIRECT TV BITES HOLD THE U. VERSE VIDEO SERVICE FRANCHISE LICENSE FROM THE CEBU CITY. IT DOES NOT OWN CONTROL THE NETWORK FACILITIES- WHICH THE SERVICES PROVIDED. WHICH MITIGATES THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE YOU SUBSTANTIVE MODIFICATION TO MOST ASPECTS OF THE BILL PROD. FOR ALL TO RAISE TO THE FAR OF THE IT'S- YOU WITH MATH. CONSTRUCTED CUTS TO COMPLY WITH THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF DICKA. AND THEY HAVE FAITH LEAD HERE TO ITS PROVISIONS SINCE OFFERING THE SERVICE ACROSS THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY IS CURRENT. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY. SAFE K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS THAT U. VERSE HAS RELIED UPON SINCE ACTION. THE REMOVAL WHICH COULD OPEN THEM UP TO NEW INTERPRETATIONS AND THE BROAD AFTER OF EQUAL. YES YOU NEED NATURE OF DIRECT TV PLAN. AND THE OF OWN OR CONTROL THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ON WHICH THE SERVICES DELIVERED. IF YOU WORSE WORK FOUND TO NOT BE IN GOOD STANDING THEY WOULD HAVE NO RESULT NO RECOURSE TO RESOLVE THE CONCERNS WE'VE ALL MET WITH ITS AUTHOR AND HE RELATE THESE CONCERNS TO HIM. AND WE DO HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH HIM TO GET ARE SET TO GET THE A MEMBERS TO ADDRESSES VITAL CONCERN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ROCKET I EFFORT TO. IT AS YOU AT BROAD DEPLOYMENT BY ALL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS DIFFICULT ONLY APPLIES TO. THE VIDEO OPERATOR THAT HAS A VIDEO SERVICE IT DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL BROADBAND PROVIDERS SO YOU'RE NOT CAPTURING EVERYONE WITH THIS BILL. ANYONE THAT PROVIDES BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS SERVICE OR ANYONE WHO'S NOT PART OF A VIDEO FRANCE. NOT COUNTED SO. YOU HAVE- DESPITE DESIGN THIS IS ANTI COMPETITIVE ANTI BUSINESS AT SELECTING WINNERS AND LOSERS SO I FELT THAT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NEXT WE WILL- LOOK TWO SAUDI AND INVITE M. ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. COME TO THE MICROPHONE AGAIN JUST STATING YOUR NAME AFFILIATION. HELLO YEAH YOU CAN PULL THE MIKE SO THERE YOU GO. GET ANY MONEY ON ON BEHALF OF SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI SHAYNA ENGLAND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND SUPPORT. WHAT YOU AND SALAS ON BEHALF OF NEXT GEN POLICY IN SUPPORT. THREE ZERO KIND REPRESENTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT COMMON SENSE MEDIA IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND JEFF DEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. ANYBODY ELSE IN SUPPORT ALL RIGHT WE WILL THEN ASK ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION TO PLEASE JOIN US AT THE MICROPHONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MORE TOP HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WE WILL TAKE IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR EITHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF. PORTNER HEART ARE THERE WERE NO MORE OF THAT ORDER FOR VAST. MONNING TOWN ALL THE BILL'S WE GET A PRESS- THANK YOU- THANK FOR BRING THIS WORD I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO ADD EQUITY AND WE HAVE RIVER VIEWS OF HOW WE DID THIS I THINK YOU KNOW I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION WHAT COMES. I HAVE THIS KIND OF BILLS COMING THROUGH. AND THEY'VE GOT NGUYEN WE ALREADY KNOW IT ONLY COVERS A FRACTION OF THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE PROVIDING BROADBAND. AND WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE AS WE SHOULD HAVE REGARDLESS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF. OF THE- THE VIDEO STREAMING SERVICES ARE BEING CONVERTED TO BROADBAND AND THEY ARE BEING USED FOR BROADBAND WHAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK IS TO HAVE A CONSISTENT PROCESS. ACROSS ALL THINGS JUST BASED ON THE LICENSES. I THINK SOMEBODY FIGURED OUT OF BECAUSE A BACK DOOR TO REFORM. AND SO I ALWAYS GET VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN WE START CHOOSING JUST ONE THING TO REFORM AND DON'T HAVE A CONSISTENT PROCESS. ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA END UP WITH INEQUITIES IN THAT FRENCH ASIAN SAUCE. HI OF TECH. YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE IT'S NOT TECHNOLOGY. SO AND PREPARE TO GVE YOU A COURTESY I TODAY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE STOP JUST DOING THE DISCUSS STUFF AND WE LOOK AT. WHAT IS THE PROCESS THAT WE WANT AS THE LEGISLATURE FOR ALL OF BROADBAND INTO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUITY. WE HAVE BEEN THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. US SEEN NO OTHER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD SECOND MOST. YES WE HAVE A MOTION AND DO WE HAVE A SECOND. THE SECOND MOTION AND SECOND MOTION BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ SECOND BY MISS WEBER AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BREAKING MINIATURE. AND YOU KNOW LOOK I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS- AND I'VE INDICATED THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM I KNOW THAT THEIR VARYING ELEMENTS OF WHAT. IT IS ASKING FOR TO SOME DEGREE- CERTAINLY DIRECT TV HAS SORT OF THIS UNIQUE. OPPOSITION IF THEY FIND THEMSELVES AND I RECOGNIZE THAT- VAST TO BE CARVED OUT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S THE WAY TO GO BUT THERE ARE I THINK MAYBE SOME OTHER IDEAS. GET TO WHERE. OF THEIR CONCERN COULD BE ALLEVIATED SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CREATIVE IN TERMS OF. WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- SO IN TERMS OF THE DOOR BEING OPENED AND- REALLY SITTING DOWN AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GO GRANULAR- I'M CERTAINLY PREPARED TO DO THAT- AND I. YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY SAY THAT WHEN YOU. MY BEST RETORT IS THE FOLKS WHO. HAVE ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL IT'S ABOUT CONSUMERS. ARE WHO ARE GOING WITHOUT. IT'S A DOUGHNUT HOLE. THE DIFFICULT HASN'T FILLED. I DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH WHAT EVERYONE AND GOOD INTENTION THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN IT WAS PUT IN PLACE. AND SO WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO NOW MAKE SURE IT GETS THERE. THE GRANITE THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND AND- AND AN EVALUATION THROUGH THE NETWORK. EVEN BROADER. BUT IF WE CAN'T GET THIS PIECE TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO THAN. GOING BROADER MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT MUCH BUT I'M NOT LOSING SOME OF THAT CONCERN- BUT I DO THINK THAT. AT THIS POINT TIME AND MAYBE IT'S ALSO THE FACT THAT THE PANDEMIC SORT OF OPEN UP OUR VISION TO. THIS WHO'S FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND THEN YOU BACKTRACK AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY ARE THEY FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY SO TO ADDRESS THAT. AND SO TO THAT EXTENT- I THINK THIS MOVES US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- BUT I AM AGAIN. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE IT THE NEXT TIME. IT WILL SHOW THAT. WE PUT SOME ADDITIONAL EFFORT INTO IT. SO I RESPECT HEARING. THANK YOU. AND I TO AS% CHAIR HAVE SEEN THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS BILL. BY ALL MEANS IT IS NOT PERFECT THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO DO- SPEAKING DIRECTLY ABOUT DIRECT TV WE KNOW THAT IS A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION AND- WINE COMMITTED THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. PARTICULAR PART BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS IF YOU GO BACK TO. TWO THOUSAND SIX. IMAGINE WHAT WE WERE ALL DOING IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN IT COMES TO CABLE WHEN IT COMES TO. HOW WE WERE VIEWING NOT ONLY ARE IN OUR OWN HOMES BUT FOR SOME OF US MAYBE. SOME OF REMOTE BUT AT THAT TIME AND IT WAS JUST BEGINNING AND WE SEE HOW THINGS OF EXPLODED. AND NOW. WHAT USED TO BE A CONSUMER PREFERENCE TO HAVE CABLE NOT HAVE CABLE ALL OF THESE THINGS WE KNOW OUR WORKPLACE FROM HEALTH CARE FROM EDUCATION. FROM JOBS. THIS IS NOW EAST CENTRAL AND THAT IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX SO WITH THAT I SUPPORT THISBILL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND I.

DAMOCLES SAW MORE THAN EVER- THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED SPECIFICALLY IT REQUIRED THE C. P. U. C. TO REVIEW VIA CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND KNOWN AS CAST OF GRANT APPLICATIONS WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS AND PROVIDES THAT APPLICATIONS ARE DEEMED APPROVED IF THE CA. DENY THAT. WHAT UNDER IT IN DAY DEADLINE- BOTTOM LINE WE WANT TO MOVE QUICKLY ON THIS THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE CPUC TO CREATE A STREAMLINED A REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS THAT SO THAT TIME LIMITED FEDERAL FUNDS CAN SO. OF AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUT pON FEDERAL DOLLARS. AS WE ALL HEARD AT OUR LAST OVERSIGHT HEARING ON THE C. P. UC'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE CAST OF PROGRAM THEY HAVE A BIG TASK AHEAD OF THEM TO SPEND TO. BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX.

TWO WEEKS IF YOU SEE A DOCTOR A FINE THE ON THE RULES FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT WHICH BELIEVE IS A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR STARTING THE FIRST GRANT CYCLE AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THEM LISTENING TO OUR COMMITTEE BEGINS. THE DECISION TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RATE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO I. HAPPY TO SEE THEM LISTEN TO OUR OUR COMMITTEE- AND THE RE WE MAY. DURING OUR HERE. NONE THE LESS LOW. MUST ALWAYS REMAIN READY TO ACT TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM AND THIS BILL IS A VEHICLE TO DO SO. I IMAGINE THAT IS THINGS PROGRESS THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE BASED ON WHAT WE ARE STAYING AT THE SEAT YOU SEE. THROUGH AND GET OUT WHAT A- COLD WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE YOUR LAN TO BENSON FROM U. S. TELECOM HERE FROM THE BROADBAND ASSOCIATION TO MAKE REMARKS. GOOD AFTERNOON OF CHAIR MEMBERS YOU'LL LANDA BENSON WITH US TELECOM THE BROADBAND ASSOCIATION WE ARE FIRST THAT WE REPRESENT CALIFORNIA FACILITY BASED WIRELINE COMPANIES IN BROADBAND PROVIDERS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP DURING THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT FUND AS YOU KNOW AS THIS BODY. THIS THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE PRIORITIZED. BROADBAND PRESS LEVEL OF FUNDING WITH THESE HISTORIC LEVEL OF TIME SENSE FUNDS. THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND SIR CASS SAID MUST NOW ATTRACT FISHER PARTICIPATION FROM BROADBAND PROVIDERS TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ENSURE ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA BENEFIT FROM TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CONNECTIVITY. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE IS WRITTEN WILL DO JUST THIS BY INCREASE IN THE NECK THE RATING THAT BLABBER REQUIRED TO CONNECT CALIFORNIA'S LACK MEANING A SERVE. SIR AND WAYS AND BILL. WE THAT THE CURRENT CASH SEPARATE DO NOT BOTH. TO IT. MANY FORTY NINE PROVIDES SINCE THE DRAFT. SEES WITH THAT CURRENT OF THE GRAN AN APPLICATION AND RESOLUTION PROCESS DEFICIENCIES THAT CREATES LENGTHY DELAYS AND DISINCENTIVES FOR PROVIDERS TO APPLY AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE INCLUDES NUMEROUS STREAMLINING PROVISIONS INCLUDING A DATE CERTAIN AS WAS TRAINED BY THE AUTHOR FOR APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF AN APPLICATION. AND IT RIDE ISN'T DENIAL AND CLOTHES IN AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE WILL PROVIDE FOR A MAN WHO MORE X. THE FOR FUSION OF FEDERAL BROUGHT FINDING FOR THESE THREE AND MORE US TELECOM AND IT COMPANY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BENSON. NOW IN OPPOSITION OF WOULD. WE HAVE ROLE COUNTY OF REPRESENTATIVE CALIFORNIA HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO THE WITNESS TABLE. HOME AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT IN OPPOSITION WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WITH THERE OKAY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT REGRETTABLY IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION- WE I FIRST WANT TO SAY- I APPRECIATE COMMITTEE STAFF- THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HAVE NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH US. ABOUT ART SIR THIS BILL- BUT WE DO RETAIN GRAVELY WITH SOME OF THE PROVISIONS- IN TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE. PRIME THAT SHOT A PROVISION UP. THAT CHECK. A AN APPLICATION WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THEN- THE APPLICATION IS DEEMED APPROVED. OUR CONCERN THERE IS THAT. THE DEEMED THE APPROVAL IS NOT NECESSARILY BASED ON THE MERITS OF THE PROJECT THAT'S BEING APPLIED FOR BUT THAT THE IT JUST DIDN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING DENIED UP. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE ARE PRETTY BASS LINE AND THAT IT JUST MEANS THAT- THAT IT THE DIAL JUST MEANS THAT IF IT MET THOSE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S PRIORITIES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE SCORING CRITERIA IN THE- IN THE FINAL DECISION. THAT THE P. YOU SEE- ADOPTED LAST WEEK DOES THE SCORING RUBRIC OR CRITERIA OUTLINED THINGS THAT THE STATE FEELS IS IMPORTANT THROUGH THAT THEY'VE OUTLINED SB ONE FIFTY SIX IN THE UC HAS ADOPTED SUCH AS MAKING SURE THE TECHNOLOGY IS SCALABLE- THAT THAT THE MIDDLE MILE IS LEVERAGED IN THOSE LAST MILE PROGRAMS. AND SO. WITH THE APPROVED AND ALSO THE FUNDING ROUND STRUCTURE THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE THROUGH THE PROPOSED DECISION WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK IF YOU HAVE A FUNDING ROUND AND THERE'S AN APPLICATION DEADLINE- EARLY APPLICATIONS- COULD BE APPROVED BEFORE OTHERS ARE REVIEWED IN. A FUNDING ROUND IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE APPLICATIONS AT THE SAME TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE APPROVING THE ONE THAT HAS THE MOST MERIT THAT MEETS- THE STATE'S PREFERENCES OF WHAT PROJECTS SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. WE AGREE WITH- THE CHAIR THAT. QUICKLY ON THE X. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE TRUNCATED TIMELINE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING HOWEVER THE FFA PROGRAM ITSELF IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED FUNDING AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN SPEED AND ENSURING THAT THE INVESTMENTS OF THESE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE FOR PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE RELIABLE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED- FOR QUITE SOMETIME WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED OUR WORK WITH- THE AUTHOR AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION THAT.

I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I VOTE I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITMENTS THAT YOU PURPORT THANK THANK YOU THE MISSING PIECE WE CAN DO ALL THE MIDDLE MILE OF THE LAST MILE. IT'S THE AFFORDABILITY THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THE I. S. PIECE OF FOR ANNUAL REPORTS IT WILL ALLOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN PUBLIC ASSISTANCE ALREADY- TO QUALIFY TO SUBSCRIBE FOR THE AFFORDABLE OFFERS WE WOULD ASK FOR A NAY VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MY NAME IS SHANE ENGLAND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIGITAL EQUITY INITIATIVE AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. WHERE COALITION OF EDUCATION HEALTH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CLIMATE JUSTICE AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOGETHER TO ADVANCE DIGITAL EQUITY. OUR EXPERIENCE ON THE GROUND ALIGNS WITH THE FINDINGS OF POLL AFTER POLL FAMILIES ARE STUCK ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TO DIVIDE BECAUSE INTERNET IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND INTERNET ACCESS AS AFFORDABLE AS TOO OFTEN SUB STANDARD. IN OUR WORK WE ARE OFTEN ASKED TO ENGAGE THE QUESTION OF WHAT AFFORDABLE MEANS AND WHAT IS REASONABLE TO ASK ADVICE PIECE. RESEARCH FROM COMMUNICATION FROM COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE BY POVERTY RATE THAN WE SELECTED A RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS FROM THE HIGHEST POVERTY AND LOWEST PARTY CENSUS BLOCKS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND SHOP FOR INTERNET SERVICE ONLINE AT THOSE ADDRESSES WHAT WE FOUND FRANKLY SHOCKED US AND I THINK-WILL SHOCK YOU LET'S GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES. IN BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO I KNOW AT ONE OF THE HIGHEST INCOMES OF CODES IN THE STATE CHARTER SPECTRUM OFFERS FOUR HUNDRED MEGABIT PER SERVICE PER SECOND INTERNET CULTURE SERVICE FOR FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH A HALF HOUR DRIVE AWAY IN THE HIGH POVERTY LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOOD OF LAKE CHARTER SPECTRUM CHARGES SEVENTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THAT SAME SERVICE. COME CHARTER OFFERS WEAPONS OF VERY LOW PAPA SOUNDS BY CENSUS INFO. INTERNET ULTRA FOUR HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND FOR FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH. ABOUT A MILE AWAY AND A HIGH POVERTY CENSUS BLOCK IN BUENA PARK THEY CHARGE SEVENTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THAT SAME SERVICE. SAN DIEGO COUNTY'S OCEANSIDE IS AN ANTI SERVICE AREA WHERE IT OFFERS RESIDENTS IN ONE OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY CENSUS BLOCKS QUOTE. IN THAT BASIC ONE POINT FIVE WITH SPEEDS OF UP TO AND THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM THE SERVICE OFFERING. UP TO ONE MEGABIT PER SECOND WHICH ON THAT IS NOT TECHNICALLY BROADBAND. FOR FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. FIVE MILES AWAY ONE OF OCEAN. PRESENTS AS WELL. P. FIVE MONTH PRICE EIGHTEEN TEAS INTERNET SEVENTY FIVE WITH SPEEDS UP TO SEVENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND. THE STATE'S DUOPOLY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THE SAME VERY HIGHLY PROFITABLY PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES WITH LUCRATIVE STATE CONTRACTS REFERENCE IN THIS BILL OFFER FAST RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE SERVICE THAT FAR EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM STANDARDS DESCRIBED IN AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY ONE. JUST NOT TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT HOST AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY ONE IS A MODEST BUT VITAL STEP TOWARDS LEVERAGING THE MASSIVE PURCHASING POWER TO INCENTIVIZE ISPS TO EXTEND SERVICE. AT LEAST APPROACHING THE SWEET DEALS THEY OFFER ARE WEALTHIEST COMMUNITIES BUT THEY SHOULD EXTEND THOSE TO OUR HIGHEST NEED HISTORICALLY MOST NEGLECTED COMMUNITIES AS WELL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA- QUIRK-SILVA FOR LEADERSHIP AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR VOTE I VOTE ON TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY. THANK YOU. L. WE WILL BRING UP OUR PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. CCT A. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO WITH CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION SO FIRST OFF WE SHARE THE OFFICERS. THE COMMITMENT HERE TO EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL FOR BROADBAND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN POPULAR WITH THE RECENT PANDEMIC WE HAVE BEEN OFFERING AFFORDABLE PLANS WHAT TEN YEARS- IN. HELP CLOSE IN OUR MATTER FOR ONE VERY SPECIFIC REASON IT IS LEVERAGING STATE BUSINESS- TO FORCE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DO SOMETHING WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE NEW- ACP THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DEBT WE HAVE OUR OWN PROGRAM- AFFORDABLE AND ACP'S TO. PROVIDE MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TO EACH STATE TO ADOPT EVEN ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS BECAUSE ABOUT HIS KEY- SO WE WANT WITH THE AUTHOR I'M TRYING TO BEING- BRING HIS BILL MORE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ACP AND WHAT WE PROVIDE. GETTING UNANSWERED LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IT IS GOING TO TAKE A VILLAGE IT'S NOT DON'T IF YOU'RE GONNA DEPEND ON US JUST TO DO IT AND YOU CAN HAVE FORCED US TO DO IT BY. A STATE CONTRACTS THAT THAT IS NOT I DO PPROACH WE THINK IT SHOULD BE A JOINT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. BOB JUST TODAY. N. T. S. T. I. A. HAD A WORKSHOP ABOUT THE NEW. PROGRAM AND THE HIGHLIGHTED A NUMBER STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THIS LOW. INCOME HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED. THE BILL CREATE. ANOTHER SB EVEN THOUGH YOU TOOK AMENDMENT TO SAY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WILL NOT APPLY TO CAL- YES WE'RE TO CAL FIRE ARE THERE ARE STILL OTHER SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE THAT ARE LIKE A THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. OF **** COMMUNICATIONS DOWN IN SAN DIEGO WE'RE NOT TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF THE GENERAL ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS TWO YEARS- AND THEN THE- SENDING WHICH DEPARTMENT CANNELLA BUSINESS WITH DOCUMENTATIONS IF COMCAST HAS BEEN SOMETHING FOR HIM TO BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WE DID A CHEAT- THE NINETY PERCENT- GOAL OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO TERMINATE THAT CONTRACT SO USING CONTRACTS TO LEVERAGE- IS NOT THE BEST APPROACH I THINK THE BETTER APPROACH IS A PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE- WE THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS AND HAS OFF PRESS THE PEN TO MAKE AMENDMENTS TO BRING THIS IN ALIGNMENT AND WE ARE WORKING ON BUT AS AS PROPOSE RIGHT NOW- THE BILL IS IN COP. MS OFFERED IT CONFUSED CUSTOMER SERVED TYPES OF PROGRAMS- IS ESTABLISHES THAT UNLAWFUL RATE REGULATION. BY SAYING THAT HI SPEECH HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE STATE. AND IT CREATES A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK BUT FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSE BUT AGAIN THANK YOU. MR GARCIA- WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY GENEROUS WITH HER TIME WITH US AND DISCUSSING THIS. AND WE WILL FOLLOW UP. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL ASK ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS IN. THE ROOM TO PLEASE APPROACH THE MIKE.

CONTINUE AND MANY OF US ARE OFFERING THE ACP SO WE UNDERSTAND AFFORDABILITY IS IMPORTANT AND IMPORTANT TO THIS BODY WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE MANAGER JONATHAN YOUR BILL ON BEHALF OF CTIA THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALSO IN OPPOSITION- FOR SUMMER CONCERNS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. Q. ANYBODY ELSE OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT THEN BRING IT BACK COMMITTEE QUESTIONS CONCERNS TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU A SWIMMER GARCIA THE QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE RECENTLY CONGRESS APPROVED A FOURTEEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR SUB TO SEE A BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTION FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS CALL THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM WAS THIS- FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE RATE WHEN YOU CAME UP WITH FORTY DOLLARS. PER PERSON. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I DON'T I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE I'M LOOKING AT THAT MAKE CONSULTANT- OKAY AND JUST AMONG OTHERS. THE- MY OTHER QUESTION IS- THAT THE FEDERAL LAW PREEMPTS ON STATE RATE REGULATIONS FOR BROADBAND PROVIDERS. WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY- LISTING A RATE OF FORTY DOLLARS WENT THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- EXEMPT AND PROCEED OVER THIS PRESIDE OVER THAT. NO NO IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN I THINK UP. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT NONE PREVIOUS QUESTION I'M SORRY- THAT PREVIOUS QUESTION ON THE A. C. P. THE ANSWER IS YES SO WITH A FORTY DOLLAR PROGRAM WITH THE ACP ADDED THAT WOULD BE A TEN DOLLAR- TWENTY FIVE THREE PROGRAM WHICH MEETS UP. BASICALLY ALBERY DEFINITION OF AFFORDABLE OKAY GREAT AND THEN CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THEM HOW DOES THIS WORK THEN THAT YOU CAN SET A RATE OF BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THE FEDERAL LAW WITH THEIR PROGRAM THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HANDLE THE RATE. DEFERRED SO THIS IS. ACTUALLY SETTING A RATE AT STATES ACTUALLY A AND EVERY OTHER STATE THAT HAS A LOCAL FRANCHISING TO- ALLOWED TO SET. RULES FOR HOW LOCALITIES CONTRACT AND CONTRACTING RULES. THAT ARE IS NOT RATE SETTING SO CUT COMPANIES COULD CHOOSE NOT TO SET THESE RATES. AND NOT TO OFFER THESE AFFORDABLE PLANS. THAT WOULD JUST ALSO BE A CHOICE TO NOT HAVE STATE CONTRACT. JUST BEEN APPRECIATE THIS IS GREAT- AND THEN SO IF SAID THIS WENT THROUGH AND IT WAS FORTY DOLLAR RATE COULD ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE COMING THE NEXT YEAR AND CHANGE THAT RATE- EITHER UP OR DOWN THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT ALLOWS FOR THE PROGRAM TO ADJUST RATES IN ALIGNMENT. WITH PVC AND FEDERAL AND ALSO SPEAKS IN ALIGNMENT WITH PC AND FEDERAL RULES BUT THERE IS I MEAN. WHAT BUT SO LIKE V. THEORETICALLY I CAN'T. I DON'T EVEN TO THE LEGISLATURE DOES QUITE A BIT- BUT YOU KNOW SURE THEORETICALLY JUST LIKE THEORETICALLY THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CHANGED YEAH SO- THEORETICALLY. I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS JUST QUICK QUESTION WHAT THEY CALLED FOR BRINGING THIS AFFORD AS I LOOK TO SUPPORT THE BILL I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION REGARDING THE INTERNET SPEEDS I KNOW A CERTAIN BEEN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE BENCHMARK BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED TO FIND BY S. B. ONE FIFTY SIX WHICH IS AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SPEEDS JUST. THOUGHT I'D THROW OUT THERE BUT THERE'S NO DISCUSSION YOU KNOW SOME SOME OF COME TO US AND SAID THAT THE SPEED THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT. NOT ADEQUATE ENOUGH RIGHT NOW AND- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE. REASONABLE RATIONAL. AND THE LEAVE SOME ROOM FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS- BUT- IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT BUT DATE. I DON'T DISAGREE BUT AGAIN WE'RE WERE WANTING- JUST A QUICK START SOMEWHERE YEAH AND MY AND MOVE- FROM THAT POINT WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NO- CONNECTIVITY. AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK SOME OLD ENOUGH ENTERTAINMENT- MADE BOLD DECISION RIGHT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS SAID LAST SUMMER OF SIX PLUS MILLION DOLLARS. AND SO WE'RE WANTING TO. GET THOSE FOLKS ON BOARD BUT REPORTER. REMAINS A QUESTION FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS GREAT TO SEE THAT THE FOURTEEN FORTY BUT IT IS A COMPROMISE OKAY GOOD LUCK BECAUSE I WAS THERE IS ALREADY A COMPROMISE YES GOOD THANK YOU ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AS CHAIR I CAN TELL YOU THAT- WE HAVE WORKED ON THIS BILL WE DO HEAR THE CONCERNS- AND WE ARE GOING TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK AS FAR AS YOUR QUESTION THE THIRTY DOLLARS ON THE- AFFORDABLE CONNECTED IT CONNECTIVE ITTY PLAN THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO. THE FORTY DOLLAR PLAN- SO. ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THE A. C. P. THAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. IS INDIVIDUALS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT NOW THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER KIND OF DISCUSSION AS FAR AS HOW DO YOU GET- PEOPLE WITH VERY LIMITED ACCESS OR- MAYBE NOT USING INTERNET MAYBE NOT EVEN GOING TO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME. MOTIONS THAT MADE ME THE VENTS OTHER AREAS BUT WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB IN. GETTING FAMILIES WHO NEED THIS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AVAILABLE BUT ALSO ALL OF THIS ALL OF THE PARAMETERS THAT COME WITH- JOINING ONTO A PLAN BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS PARTICULARLY IN THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE SEEN FAMILIES BE OFFERED IF YOU WANT TO SAY. A LOW INTERNET PLAN MAYBE STARTING AT THIRTY DOLLARS AND THEN THREE FOUR MONTHS DOWN THE LINE IT'S NOW SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND- SOME PEOPLE. REALLY IF YOU WANT TO STAY READ NINE PRINT BUT THEY ARE NOW ENROLLED IN THIS PLAN SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO ON THE FORCIBLE CONNECTIVE ITTY PLAN IS REALLY GETTING ACCESS I KNOW ONE OF THE PROVIDERS TOLD ME THAT- CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE-% LOWEST- NUMBERS IN PEOPLE ACCESSING. AFFORDABLE CONNECTED TIVITY PLANNED SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO WORK ON THAT PART THAT BEING SAID- WE HAVE. I THINK A MOTION AND A SECOND- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
