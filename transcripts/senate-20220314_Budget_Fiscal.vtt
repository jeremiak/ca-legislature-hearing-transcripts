00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:34.866
TO WHICH THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:37.068
PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND COST THE

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:40.137
CITY MILLION EMERGENCY SERVICE

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:42.139
THERE IS AN IMPACT ROAD. AND

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.208
QUALITY OF LIFE AND I THINK THAT

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:46.410
FOR YEARS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:48.212
REMEMBER THE UNIVERSITY-

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:52.116
MISMANAGED FUNDS AND- STRUGGLE

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:57.688

HAVE ANY FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT I

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:00.925

HAVE TO ADMIT NEW STUDENTS AND

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:19.176
SO I THINK THE IDEA THAT THAT-

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:21.379
WOULDN'T SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH-

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:24.682

REASON THAT UC BERKELEY DOES NOT

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.140
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE MORE

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:12.009
STUDENTS. FOR NEXT YEAR-

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.043
ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WILL

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.513
ACTUALLY INCREASE- RENTS FOR

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:16.981
EVERYONE IN THE CITY OF BERKELEY

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:18.716
WHICH WILL HIT INCOME LOW INCOME

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.918
STUDENTS AND LOW INCOME NON

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.820
STUDENTS FAMILIES THE HARDEST.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.922
AND SO WE DO NOT WANT ANY NEW

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.724
STUDENTS UP TO LIVE AND CAN'T

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:29.460
CUT CAMPERS CARD OR HOTEL ROOM

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:30.194
LIKE THEY ARE IN OTHER

GOOD MORNING. I JUST WANTED TO

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:36.820
MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS BECAUSE

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:38.589
I'M LOOKING AT THE OVERALL

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:40.791
UMBRELLA IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ON

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:42.492
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THOUGH

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:45.596
SOMEONE WHO TRULY APPRECIATES

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:47.731
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AND

00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:49.533
THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS TO YOU

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.568
FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES I

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:53.837
JUST WANT TO JUST EMPHASIZE

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:55.138
RIGHT NOW THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:57.774
HAVING SECRET REFORM AS A WHOLE

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.509
NOT JUST SPECIFICALLY TO THE

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:00.644
PROJECTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:01.745
IMPORTANT BUT JUST IN IN

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:04.615
OVERALL. I INTEND THAT WE REALLY

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:07.017

THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:18.829
WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:20.864
COMMUNITIES AND THE COST OF

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.166
HOUSING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. IN

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:27.304
THE IN THE EFFORT THAT WE MUST

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:29.840
MAKE AS A LEGISLATURE TO ASSURE

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:32.276
THAT- OUR UNIVERSITIES HAVE THE

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:33.810
HOUSING THAT THEY NEED TO

00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:35.512

OTHERWISE THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:44.988
REASONS WHY- THE COST OF- ABD

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:46.657
GOING TO SCHOOL IS SO IT'S PART

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:48.625
OF ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF WHY

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:49.993
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO GO TO

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.729
SCHOOL- I'M IN CALIFORNIA.

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.798

OF THAT AND WE MAKE A GREATER

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.835
IMPACT ON IT THE COST OF HOUSING

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:00.270

MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:14.484
THAT THOUGH THIS IS NEEDED. IT

IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE. ON THE

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:29.900
COST OF HOUSING FOR BOTH OUR

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.968
STUDENTS WERE COMING IN THE COST

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:35.872
OF SCHOOLING AS WELL AS OUR

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:36.973
LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. SENATOR

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.146

CAN'T COUNT HOW MANY TIMES NOW-

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.520
IN THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN IN

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:52.289
THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE HAVE

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.825

FOR- THIS EXEMPTION AS WELL BUT

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:02.099
I THINK THAT THE BIGGER QUESTION

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:04.167
IS. WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:05.836
CALIFORNIA THAT IS HAVING A

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:08.171
HOUSING CRISIS IN THESE IN THIS

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:10.173
SEQUEL LAW HAS BEEN ABUSED-

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.043
QUITE FRANKLY BY LABOR IT'S BEEN

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.044
IT'S BEEN ABUSED BY

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.846
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS IT'S BEEN

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:17.447
ABUSED BY BUSINESS AGAINST

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:18.982
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.717
NEED TO DO SOME REFORM IN THIS

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:23.086
AREA- THIS IS THE MOTHER MAY I.

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.455
SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN COME TO

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.090
THE LEGISLATURE AND GET AN

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.692
EXEMPTION. AND THAT THAT ALLOWS

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.027
THEM TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WHAT

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:32.195
ABOUT THE REST OF CALIFORNIA

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:34.097
THAT WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD TO

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.832
DRIVE THE COST OF HOUSING DOWN

00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:37.567
TO DRIVE THE COST OF GOODS AND

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.702
SERVICES THAT WE NEED IN

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:40.003
CALIFORNIA THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.938
ADDRESSED AS WELL SO I JUST

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:44.441
WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATORS TO

00:50:44.508 --> 00:50:46.643
LOOK AT- SEQUEL REFORM SO THAT

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.245
THE REST OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:50.981
THE ONES THAT ARE- CARVED OUT-

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.682
CAN MOVE FORWARD OR WE CAN DRIVE

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:53.784
THE COST OF LIVING DOWN FOR

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.118

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:27.384
THAT HAS NOW MOVED TO TARGET.

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:30.887
STUDENTS I THINK IN THIS STATE

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:35.459
WE CAN HAVE A SKILLED WORK FORCE

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:49.025
COMMENTS THAT ONE OF THE

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:51.261
SPEAKERS REQUESTED CLARITY AND

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:53.129
AFTER THIS DEBATE I WOULD LIKE

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:56.399
TO OFFER A LITTLE CLARITY ARE

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.735
THERE WAS A VERY UNIQUE PART OF

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:00.737
THE STATUTE THAT LED TO THE

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:02.439
COURT CASE. THAT CALLED OUT

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:06.543
SPECIFICALLY ENROLLMENT AS A- AS

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.678
A PROJECT FOR THE PURPOSE OF

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:10.013
THIS THIS ISN'T ABOUT SEQUIN

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.748
GENERAL IT IS THE WAY THAT WAS

00:54:11.815 --> 00:54:14.884
DONE. AND THAT WAS AN OVERREACH

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:17.020
OF REALLY ENROLLMENT SHOULD NOT

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.788
BE A PROJECT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:21.458
BE SUBJECT TO THAT WE'VE HEARD

00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:22.759
THE TESTIMONY THIS BILL IS AN

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:25.428
ELEGANT FIX TO THAT AND I'M VERY

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:27.564
GRATEFUL FOR. BUT SOMEHOW THE

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:30.000
SPEECHES ED TURNED US INTO A

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:33.303
LARGER ISSUE AND IT'S MUCH MORE

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.105
COMPLICATED THAN THAT. I THINK

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:37.273
LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM I COULD

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.609
BE WRONG. BUT I THINK I'M THE

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:44.447
ONLY FORMER MAYOR OF A CITY THAT

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:44.948
HOSTS THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:45.815
CALIFORNIA. THERE OFF THE TAX

00:54:45.882 --> 00:54:49.419
ROLLS. IN OUR TOWN IT'S ROUGHLY

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:49.986
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE.

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:54.090
INSIDE A CITY OF SIXTY THOUSAND

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.859
THAT IS COMPLETELY OFF THE TAX

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:58.194
ROLLS. SO ARE THEY FELT GUILTY

00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.896
ABOUT COMPETING WITH OUR HOTEL

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:02.265
INDUSTRY SO THEY VOLUNTARILY

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.600
SUBMIT THE ROOM TAX SAYING

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:05.135
THEY'RE NOT WAVING THEIR

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:07.270
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. BUT THEY

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:12.909
DO IT. ARM IN HE HE YOU KNOW THE

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:15.111
IRONY OF IRONIES IS GIVEN THE

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:18.581
DEBATE. THAT WE HAVE FOUR TO

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:19.382
FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.618
IN SANTA CRUZ BECAUSE OF C.

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.553
CORE. UNIVERSITY DIDN'T WANT TO

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.356
DO IT. SINCE THERE ARE NO LOCAL

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:28.291
LAND USE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.894
LOCAL TAXES. ANY LOCAL

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.196
JURISDICTION. WE ARE

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:36.099
NEGOTIATIONS WITH C. KUO MADE AS

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.168
A PRIORITY BUILDING ADDITIONAL

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:41.204
HOUSING ON CAMPUS. AND SO FOR

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:43.273
THE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS EXIST

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:46.776
BECAUSE OF C. CORE. IF YOU WERE

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.411
TO REMOVE SEAPORT FROM THE

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:50.313
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WOULD

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.216
BE A 100% GET OUT OF JAIL FREE

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:54.784
CARD. AND IT REALLY EXISTS FOR

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:57.787
FACULTY IT EXISTS FOR STAFF AS

00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:00.490
WELL AS THE IMPACTS. OF THE

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:02.892
CONSTRUCTION I DON'T KNOW WE

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:03.860
HAVE THE- SUBCOMMITTEE ON

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:05.929
EDUCATION THIS YEAR. AND WE

00:56:05.995 --> 00:56:07.997
WORKED ON THE FLOOR WE WERE

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.833
TRYING TO. ADDRESS THE

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:12.368
UNDERLYING FACTORS WE HAD A

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.204
DISCUSSION IN THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:15.305
CALIFORNIA HEARING BEFORE WE

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.540
EVEN KNEW THAT THIS LAWSUIT WAS

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:20.210
OUT THERE. WERE PART OF THE

00:56:20.276 --> 00:56:21.811
DISCUSSION WAS. YOU'RE JAMMING

ALL ADDITIONAL MOMENT IN THE

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:25.048
EXISTING FOOTPRINT OF THE

GROWTH CAN BE ACCOMMODATED

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:34.624
BECAUSE THIS REALLYIS ABOUT

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:37.026
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE. AND THIS

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:38.128
IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT CAMPUS

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:40.630
AFTER CAMPUS WORDS CAN EXCEED

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:43.299
ITS CAPACITY IF WE DON'T FIGURE

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:47.036
OUT HOW TO HAVE NEW CAMPUSES ARE

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.772
NEW CENTERS OFF THE CAMP THIS.

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:49.939

A THREE YEAR PROGRAM. AND ONE OF

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:14.731
THE THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT-

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:16.232
WHEN WE MOVED TO THIS BUDGET IS

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.701
WHETHER WE AUGMENT THAT BECAUSE

00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:21.004
WE REALLY HAVE TO PROVIDE. ARE

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:25.375
THE HOUSING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:28.144
AND SO. IT N. WE ALSO ADDRESS

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.213
THE ISSUE LAST YEAR THAT'S BEING

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.448
IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. ABOUT

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:34.017
PRIORITIZING SOME IN STATE

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:36.052
STUDENTS OVER OUT OF STATE

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.321
STUDENTS. SO THAT BASICALLY THE

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:39.088
PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN PAYING

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:41.891
TAXES. FOR GENERATIONS CAN HAVE

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:45.895
THEIR KIDS GO TO UC. SO I DON'T

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:47.564
THINK THIS IS LIKE A SIMPLE

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:50.533
REFORM ISSUE. THIS ADDRESSES THE

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.836
ISSUE IN FRONT OF US IN THE

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:55.004
RIGHT WAY. BUT WE HAVE TO DO

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.006
MORE HOUSING WE HAVE TO HAVE

00:57:57.073 --> 00:57:58.908
MORE SPACES ACROSS THE SYSTEM.

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:01.744
THAT THAT ALLOW FOR THIS WE HAVE

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:02.979
TO HAVE SEQUEL ACTUALLY

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:04.647
ADDRESSES FACULTY AND STAFF

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.516
INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MAKE SURE

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:07.851
THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE FACULTY

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:10.453
AND STAFF THAT MATCHED THE

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.621
STUDENTS. THERE'S AN ALLEGATION

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:14.490
AND MY- OUR HOME COMMUNITY WHICH

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:16.893
IS HOTLY DISPUTED. THAT ALL THE

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.962
STUDENTS ARE ACCEPTED BUT THE

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:20.563
BUILDINGS AND THE PROJECTIONS

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.665
FOR FACULTY AND STAFF OR NOT AT

00:58:22.732 --> 00:58:25.235
THE SAME TIME. SO WE HAVE TO

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:26.769
WORK ON ALL THOSE OTHER ISSUES

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.972
AND I WANT THEM TO BE SEPARATE

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:30.373
FROM THIS. BECAUSE WE ARE FIXING

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.442
A PROBLEM AND A LOT TODAY AND

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:33.643
MAKING SURE THOSE STUDENTS THAT

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.912
WERE ACCEPTED IN BERKELEY HAVE A

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:39.182
PLACE TO GO. SO ARE STRONGLY.

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:41.417
READ DENIED. BUT ALSO THAT WE

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:43.353
FOUGHT THROUGH WE LOOK AT THIS

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:45.922
ISSUE GOING FOR. THANK YOU MR

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:47.557
ALERTS WE HAVE A MOTION AND

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:49.459
BEFORE I ASK THE MR STEPHAN

00:58:49.525 --> 00:58:51.628
CHARTER CALL THE RULE WE JUST

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:57.467
SPEAK TO A FEW POINTS. ON D. D.

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.802
FOR THIRTY YEARS. WE HAVE HAD

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.537
STATUTE IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:04.307
CODE THAT REQUIRES OUR THREE

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.075
HIGHER PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:07.277
SEGMENTS TO DO LONG RANGE

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:08.745
DEVELOPMENT PLAN SUBJECT TO

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:10.914
SEQUENCE AND DURING THAT TIME

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.582
THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS SENTENCE

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:14.417
THAT SAID. THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:16.185
IMPACTS OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:18.288
WOULD BE EVALUATED NOW IN THAT

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:19.555
THIRTY YEARS WELL THERE HAVE

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:21.024
BEEN MANY MANY MANY MANY

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:24.027
LAWSUITS- REGARDING THE LONG

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:27.463
RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS WE'VE

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:31.734
YET HAD A COURT. IDENTIFY THAT

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:36.673
DID. THE STATUTE AS REQUIRING

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.875
STUDENT ENROLLMENT AS A SEPARATE

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:40.443
AND A PROJECT INTO AN ITSELF

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.879
UNDER SECRET. AND THAT BUT A

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:46.282
COURT IN THIS CASE DID SO. WHILE

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:48.084
THE THIRTY YEARS THAT DID NOT

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:49.786
HAPPEN IT DID NOW SO THAT IS ONE

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:51.955
OF THE ISSUES AS A MISTER LORD

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.790
POINTED OUT. WE ARE CORRECTING

00:59:53.856 --> 00:59:55.491
HOWEVER WE'RE CORRECTING IT DUE

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.460
TO THAT THIS MOST RECENT COURT

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:59.629
RULING NOW THE OTHER THING I

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.931
THINK THAT WE IN REVIEWING THE

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:04.968
STATUTE. WHILE IT PRESERVES AT

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:07.103
HIM AND RIGHTFULLY SO THE

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.205
ABILITY TO NOT ONLY THE ABILITY

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.007
TO REQUIREMENT TO DO NO RDP AND

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.508
THAT IT'S SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT.

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:13.910
WHAT IT DOES IS BY PULLING OUT

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:18.414
THAT ONE SENTENCE IT IS NOT-

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:20.616
PRESUPPOSE THAT STUDENT

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:23.786
ENROLLMENT ALONE. IS THE SOLAR

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:25.421
PRIMARY IMPACT BECAUSE AS WE

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.223
KNOW EVERYONE OF OUR CAMPUSES

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.158
HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT-

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.461
COMPONENTS IF WE TAKE UCSF FOR

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.029
EXAMPLE WITH THE MEDICAL CENTER

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.430
THEY'RE PROBABLY FAR MORE

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:37.300
PATIENTS STAFF AND DOCTORS. WHO

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:39.869
GO IN AND OUT OF UCSF EVERYDAY

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.704
THAN THERE ARE STUDENTS SO

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.106
OBVIOUSLY AN ENVIRONMENT A

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:44.607
REVIEW OF A LONG RANGE

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:46.175
DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT CAMPUS

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.111
WOULD HAVE TO FACTOR THOSE

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.346
THINGS AND OBVIOUSLY NOT. SOLELY

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.015
IN NLY THE STUDENT ENROLLMENT

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.483
OR IT WOULDN'T BE A VERY

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.585
ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.520
NOW THE OTHER THING THAT I

01:00:57.587 --> 01:01:00.323
FOUND. INTERESTING IS THAT IN

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.425
THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT IN

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.894
VARIOUS- FOLKS CALLED AND SAID

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.462
YOU KNOW THE REAL ISSUE IS

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.797
BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:10.833
HOUSING- ON WE HALF AS SENATOR

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.136
LAYERED POINTED OUT. WE THE

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.904
LEGISLATURE HAS AND I'M VERY

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.639
PROUD OF THIS AND IN WOULD HAVE

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:17.774
BEEN BETTER IF WE DID IT IN

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.977
WE'VE HAD DONE IT FOR YEARS AND

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:22.779
YEARS BUT WE HAVE. ALLOCATED

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.781
SIGNIFICANT FUNDS IN THE LAST

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:27.383
BUDGET. TO BILLION OVER A COUPLE

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.018
YEAR PERIOD FOR STUDENT HOUSING

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.453
BUT AS POINTED OUT IS ALREADY

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.355
OVER SUBSCRIBED TO CLEARLY WE

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.257
SHOULD LOOK AT THAT FOR THIS

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:35.758
BUDGET. BUT INTERESTINGLY IN

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.427
SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.328
USE BERKELEY AS AN EXAMPLE

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:41.497
BECAUSE WHILE I WAS NOT MAYOR. I

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:43.399
WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER IN THAT

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.968
CITY AND GIVEN THAT BOTH SANTA

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.070
CRUZ AND BERKELEY OUR CITY

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.304
MANAGER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT I

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.273
THINK OUR ROLES WERE IN THE IN

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.208
TERMS OF JURISDICTIONAL

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:58.314
AUTHORITY SEMI SIMILAR- WE. ARE

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.084
VOTERS PASSED AN ORDINANCE THE

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.018
NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.520
ORDINANCE BACK IN NINETEEN

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:05.621
SEVENTY THREE THAT IN EFFECT

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:09.025
PREVENTED CHANGE THE ZONING SUCH

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.326
A PRETTY MUCH LIMITED THE

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.562
ABILITY FOR THERE TO BE MULTI

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.330
FAMILY BUILDINGS BUILT IN

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.366
BERKELEY FOR YEARS FOR DECADES.

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.502
NOW IF YOU HAVE THE COMBINATION

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.605
OF. THE LACK OF STUDENT HOUSING

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.807
PROVIDED BY THE ACTUAL. CAMPUS

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:27.710
ENTITY ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:31.981
THAT IS BASICALLY. CAPITALIZING

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:32.915
YOU'RE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE A

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.418
PROBLEM LIKE THIS BUT IT DOESN'T

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.520
YOU CANNOT POINT ONLY A FINGER

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.789
AT ONE OF THE ENTITIES SO IN

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:41.624
OTHER WORDS WELL WE WANT ALL OF

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.526
OUR CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE MORE

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.761
HOUSING THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:48.197
PLAYER WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.867
OUR HIGH HOUSING CRISIS SO I

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.168
CAN'T SPEAK TO THE OTHER

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.202
COMMUNITIES AND WHETHER THEY'VE

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:55.004
DONE SO SIMILARLY BUT I THINK

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:56.839
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.841
FACING IS THAT ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:02:58.908 --> 01:02:59.809
WE HAVE HAD OUR LOCAL

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:02.712
GOVERNMENTS. ARE NOT AS WILLING

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.247
TO BUILD THE HOUSING THAT WE

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:06.883
KNOW THAT OUR STATE NEEDS SO

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.417
WHILE THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:10.119
IT'SCERTAINLY ADDRESSES THE

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:13.589
SPECIFIC PROBLEM OF THE CAP THAT

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.525
THE COURT PUT RIGHT NOW ONE

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:17.026
STUDENT ENROLLMENT FOR THIS FALL

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:19.061
FOR UC BERKELEY AND IN THE LONG

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:21.864
TERM AT LEAST MAKES ALL OF THE

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:22.999
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A LONG

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:25.101
RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN HAVE TO

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.903
BE ASSESSED WITHOUT PREJUDICING

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.539
STUDENT ENROLLMENT ALONE SO.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.574
WE'LL NOW TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:36.913
