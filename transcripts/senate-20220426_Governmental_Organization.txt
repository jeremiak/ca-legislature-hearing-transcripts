TWO ONE WHAT ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS WALKERS THROUGH THAT THANK YOU IN AND OF COURSE I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT SO IF I IF I MAY BE ABLE TO -- TO REFER THIS TO DETERRENT MISTER LANG YES MISTER LANG FROM OUT OF THE MONEY CAMPAIGN THIS RULING HI YES WOULD YOU HIRE THIS QUESTION A YES THANK YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW YES YES YES WEEKEND DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION MISTER LANG I DID YES THEY DID YEAH THANK YOU THAT'S VERY GOOD QUESTION WHAT WHAT WE ARE POSING AS AMENDMENTS WOULD BE THAT IN THE CASE WHERE A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS -- WAS WAS TAKEN WAS WAS DONE AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE OR TWO IT IN THAT CASE THE NO BID CONTRACT COULD BE GRANTED TO THE COMPANY EVEN IF THEY GAVE UP THEY HAVE TO TAKE THAT -- OR IF IF THERE'S A DETERMINATION MADE THAT THAT THE COMPANY WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD FULFILL THE CONTRACT THERE ARE CASES LIKE THAT THEN AGAIN THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN NO BID CONTRACT IN THAT CASE EVEN IF THEY GAVE BEHALF PAYMENT BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION WHAT WE BELIEVE THOSE OF MEN SHOULD BE SHOULD BE MADE UP BUT WE THINK THE CORE OF THE BILL SAY THAT IF THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AFTER YOU'VE DONE THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS OR OR NOT THAT IN THOSE CASES THE -- NO BID CONTRACTS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED FROM THE FROM MEDICAID MR FROM A COMMENT SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IF THE EXPERTISE THE NECESSITY THE EMERGENCY -- WOULD OVERRIDE THE BEHEST THEN -- THAT WOULD BE LOOKED AT THE QUALIFICATIONS IN THE BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF THE BETTER THAT CORRECT IF IF THERE WERE NOT OTHER IT WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT RIGHT TO IT IF IF IF THERE WAS A YEAH THAT THE TENTATIVE BIDDING PROCESS AND AND AND THE COMPANY GAVE THE PERHAPS WAS THE WAS THE ONLY DOCTOR ONE ONLY TWO OPTIONS THEN THREE GIVEN THE NO BID CONTRACT THEY WERE THE BEST OPTION IN THAT CASE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE WILL THAT OTHER OP IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IF THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS OTHER THAN THE ONE THAT GAVE THE PAST BIG A PAYMENT AND THAT WILL GIVE THE PUBLIC MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WE NOW TO THE ELEMENTS THAT WOULD -- I GUESS MAKE IT AT SECURE TRUST TO BOOK IT WOULD BE THE HISTORY THE THE STATUS OF THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY AND THE REPUTATION AND ON OR NOT -- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT WOULD ALL COME INTO PLAY YEP WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS ABSOLUTELY THOSE THINGS ALL DEFINITELY COME INTO PLAY THAT GUIDED ME WIN A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS AND ONLY ONE OR TWO AND THEY MAY STILL BE CHOSEN JUST WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT SITUATION WHERE -- THE THE PUBLIC SEES THAT THAT THE COMPANY THEY GAVE A LARGE THAT HAS -- WAS WAS CHOSEN AND THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A REASON THERE WAS NO COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS WENT HEY LOOK AT THE THESE THREE OR FOUR OTHERS THAT THE PUBLIC WILL FILL THAT BOX AT IN THE APPLE RAISES CONCERNS WITH THE PUBLIC I THINK WE'VE SEEN AND -- THAT'S WHAT WE WHAT THE STILL ADDRESSING THIS BILL AFTER MENDING MAKE SURE THAT THE CASES THAT YOU DESCRIBE WOULD BE COVERED LET'S LOOK LET ME JUST POINT OUT OF THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN SO FAR IT WE CAN'T TAKE A MEMBERS HERE IN THIS MEETING TODAY THERE'S ANOTHER MEETING ELECTIONS MEETING TOMORROW DO NOT TAKE CARE OF THOSE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS MMHM YOUR VENTURE MY QUESTION THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER YEAH THANK YOU JERRY DIED -- YOU KNOW THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS BILL IS IS ONE IN WHICH I -- YOU KNOW GENERAL TERMS SUPPORT -- I I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS -- EFFORTS TO TRY TO ARE AND TO TRY TO ELIMINATE CONFLICT OF INTERESTS ARE GOOD MOTIVATIONS AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS ONES IN WHICH I SUPPORT -- BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN BECAUSE OF A KEY ELEMENT TO IT AND THAT'S THIS ISSUE OF IN AN EMERGENCY IN AN EMERGENCY -- WE ALL WANNA TRY TO ELIMINATE CONFLICTS NINE BILLS TO DO JUST THAT THIS YEAR BUT IN AN EMERGENCY YOU DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY -- THAT ONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THREE BIDS SIX CETERA THE QUESTIONS BEFORE US IS THIS ISSUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE CHOICES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITH THIS EMERGENCY AND AS THIS ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABILITY HOUSE UP WELL WE AS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO APPROVE THE MONEY SO THERE IS A CHECK WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR THOSE CHOICES I NUMBER TWO GOVERNOR WAS SUBJECT TO RECALL FOR HOW HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW THE RESULTS OF THAT BUT THAT WAS AN ACCOUNTABILITY TEST FOR THE DECISIONS HE MADE IN THIS EMERGENCY AND FINALLY HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE BALLOT AND AND JUST A FEW WEEKS -- AND THEY'LL BE ANOTHER ANOTHER ACCOUNTABILITY TEST FOR HIM IN TERMS OF HOW HE HAS DONE DO I LIKE TO SEE THIS TYPE OF OF OF CLOSE LINKAGE BETWEEN OF THE HAS THE PAYMENT AT A NO BID CONTRACT NOW NO BUT IF THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY SAID LET'S ELIMINATE THE HAS TO PAYMENTS OKAY WELL I'M INTERESTED IN MAYBE SUPPORT A BILL LIKE THAT LET'S ELIMINATE THE HAS TO PAYMENTS IF WE THINK THAT'S THE CORROSIVE EFFECT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF DOWNSIDES TO THAT TO IN TERMS OF THE CHARITY WORK THAT'S DONE BY PEOPLE AND AND AND AND AND I ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE BENEFITTED FROM CERTAINLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND DURING THIS EMERGENCY AND THE RECORD COULD REFLECT A LOT OF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS WHAT THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY HAVE GONE BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD PART OF THE STANDARDS FOR THE HAS TO PAYMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO REPORT IT WOULD THEN NOT SIX MONTHS NOT THREE MONTHS BUT THIRTY DAYS SO ONCE AGAIN THERE IS SOME TRANSPARENCY IN THIS SPACE DOES IT MEAN THAT WE'VE ELIMINATED THE CLOSE THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT NO WE HAVEN'T THIS BILL TRIES TO GET TRIES TO GET TO THAT SPACE BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S AN EMERGENCY THAT MAKES ME GIVE PAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME COMMON GROUND IN THIS SPACE THAT I CAN WEEK THREAD THE NEEDLE A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN WHAT WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY I'M AB RELUCTANTLY I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING CENTER BAKER THANK YOU YES I THINK MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR GLAZERS MADE A LOT OF THE AT POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE I GUESS CERTAINLY GIVES ME PAUSE WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS WITH THE A CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN COVER CALIFORNIA OTHERS WHO ARE THE GOOD GOVERNMENT GROUPS ARE ON IN SUPPORT BUT AT I DO YOU WANT TO COME BACK TO WORK CENTER GLAZER SAID ABOUT AN EMERGENCY AND WEBER STATE ALLOW THE POINTS HE SAID THERE BUT I THINK THE RELEVANT AND AND EVEN THE SUPPORTERS HAVE RAISED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS IS IN HOUSES DOES WITH THE CURRENT BILL I DO WANNA SAY FOR BEST A PAYMENTS ITSELF YOU KNOW THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THESE ARE THESE ARE NEFARIOUS PAYMENTS I'D SAY IN MY VIEW I SAY WE DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE THEM YOU KNOW THERE IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF BEST A PAYMENTS THAT WAS DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE WAS TENS OF MILLIONS OF THIS YEAR HEALTH FOUNDATION THE CDC FOUNDATION PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE EVEN FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THOSE WERE USED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ADDS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE MASKS TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN SO THOSE ARE ALL NEGATIVE MATT I'D SAY WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE THEM IN THE END -- AGAIN IN THE CASE OF EMERGENCY WHICH THESE PAYMENTS CAME IN AND WHEN THESE CONTRACTS AWARDED SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT GIVE ME PAUSE TO -- TO TO COME OUT AND SUPPORT THE BILL CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALONG THE LINES OF BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO JUST SPOKE I BELIEVE GOOD GOVERNMENT IS IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- MY COMMUTE BE TAKEN CARE OF IN CASE IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY AND I THINK IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE WE CANNOT LEAVE OUR COMMUNITIES TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES WHEN THERE IS A TRUE EMERGENCY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENED BOB AGAIN I WILL ALSO PAUSE ON THIS BILL BECAUSE WE CANNOT JUST SAY -- WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY WE AND ALL THAT THAT THIS WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED A LOT OF THE BEHEST HE HAS A PAYMENTS WERE BASED ON ON THE NEED AT THE TIME TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES -- WITH AGAIN I WOULD LIKE MY COMMUNITY TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY AND THIS WILL LEAVE OUR COMMUNITIES PRETTY MUCH TELL TO DRY CELL FOR THAT I WILL ALSO STAFF THANK YOU ASSEMBLY SIR BORDERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE TO -- THE -- -- THE DISCUSSION ON THESE POINTS OBVIOUSLY I'M DISADVANTAGED IN NOT HAVING -- THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR SO -- I HOPE I DON'T OVERSTEP MYSELF -- BY SAYING THE FOLLOWING I THINK WHAT IS THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO HERE IS -- INJECT -- HIGHER LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND CREDIBILITY TO THE PROCESS WE KNOW THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC I DURING THE DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY BASS PAYMENTS PROBABLY USE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF COMMUNITIES THE BETTERMENT OF THE STATE'S AND IT'S ABOUT THE STATE AND ITS RESIDENTS SO I THINK I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AS THIS GETTING TO SENATOR GLAZERS POINT THAT THIS ACTUALLY CAN BEING A BENEFICIAL PROCESS THAT ENCOURAGES FOLKS TO STILL ODD -- DIRECT PHILANTHROPIC OR CHARITABLE DOLLARS TO DESIGNATED ALL BENEFIT FROM THAT FROM THAT PROCESS WHICH WANT TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CONFLATE THE BIDDING PROCESS WITH THE CHARITABLE DONATION AND SO I THINK WHAT I HEARD FROM CENTER GLAZER AND OTHERS IS THAT THIS WAS A UNIQUE MOMENT IN TIME DURING THE DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSIDER ON ADDITIONAL MODIFICATIONS TO THIS BILL TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THAT A BILL LIKE THIS CAN'T STOP OR DIES AND I AND I WOULD I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CENTER WELCOME TO ENGAGE FURTHER WITH THE COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY ON THE EMERGENCY CALCULATION BECAUSE IF THERE IS A DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE FLEXIBILITY MORE FLEXIBILITY INHERENT IN THE PROCESS BUT OUTSIDE OF THOSE UNIQUE I AND -- EXISTENCE CIRCUMSTANCES MAYBE WE NEED TO HAVE A MORE TRANSPARENT IN BASELINE APPROACH SO IN IN CLOSING COLLEAGUES I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK ON BEHALF OF SENATOR WILK THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD WITH POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE THE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT NOT JUST ONE TO FOUR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE BROUGHT UP NOW THAT WE'VE NARROWED THE ISSUE ARE AND THE ROB I THINK WE COULD RESOLVE IT SO WITH YOUR -- WITH YOUR PERMISSION FOR THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD TODAY -- ON BEHALF OF CENTER WILK HE WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE WITH INTENDED AMENDMENTS FORTHCOMING THANK YOU SENATOR GORGEOUS -- THIS IS WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL I GET A MOTION ON THAT AND GET A VOTE -- BEFORE THAT -- CENTER GLAZER J.

S. SENATOR STAFF WOULD WELCOME THAT IF IT ALLOWS FOR THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE FASHION THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT AMENDMENT TO BE REVIEWED IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE TOMORROW WELL THAT'S PROCESS WE HAVE A PROCESS SO -- I DON'T I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING BUT -- UP BRING IT ON I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO -- PRESENT WHICH CAN I -- YEAH DO YOU MIND IF I CONSULT WITH -- THE CENTER STAFF BEFORE THE VOTE OCCURS JUST THERE'S NOT A VOTE RIGHT NOW YOU GOT PLENTY OF TIME I'M LEAVING FOR JUDICIAL JUST ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR AND I WILL I WILL I WILL CONCLUDE FOR THE SECOND FINAL TIME MEASURE YOU -- THAT COMMITTEE IS FULLY CONSTITUTED IN THIS BILL IS VOTED UPON RECOMMENDATION TO TO THE AUTHOR THAT THERE BE AN EXCLUSION DURING STATES OF EMERGENCY THANK YOU OKAY AT THIS POINT TIME WE'RE MOVING ON TO -- ITEM NUMBER TEN THAT'S S.

B. ELEVEN NINETY EIGHT BY SENATOR WIRE I'M CHANNELING MY INNER SENATE MCGUIRE COME ON DOWN IF MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I. COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AND STAFF I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AT THIS BILL HERE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AND I ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU TO THE CONSULTANT TEAM OUT FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND THEIR GARDEN FOR GUIDANCE SO LOOK BOTTOM LINE IS CALIFORNIA MAY CRAFT BEER COOL THE INDUSTRY IS STILL MOSTLY MOM AND POP THE INDUSTRY IS MOSTLY INDEPENDENTLY OWNED AND OPERATED AND CRAFT BREWERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE YEARS I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL POINT OUT WHICH IS OUR FAVORITE CRAFT BREWERY IN OUR DISTRICT BUT ELEVEN HUNDRED CRAFT BREWERS CALL THE GOLDEN STATE HOME THE BREWERIES ARE MORE THAN A NOVELTY YOU'RE PART OF CALIFORNIANS IDENTITY NOW THERE ARE COMMUNITIES GATHERING GROUNDS THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY THEY OPERATE THESE BELOVED INSTITUTIONS AND THEY'RE OUR NEIGHBORS IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD CRAFT BREWERIES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO THE STATE I COUNTY FOR ABOUT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND JOBS AND CONTRIBUTING JUST UNDER TEN BILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS BELOVED INDUSTRY IN THE LATE SIXTIES CRAFT BREWERS HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SHIP BEER DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS MOST RECENTLY THIS ABILITY HAS BEEN A LIFELINE FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY DURING THE PANDEMIC SB ELEVEN NINETY EIGHT IT'S A COMMON SENSE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL MAKE HOME TOWNS WILL MAKE OUR HOME TOWNS AND HOME TOWNS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE STRONGER IT'S GOING TO PROTECT THE EXISTING ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA BREWERS SHIP BEER DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS BY EXTENDING THAT SAME PRIVILEGE TO ADD A STATE BREWERIES TO DO THE SAME EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT LIKE THAT SO LET ME PROVIDE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE WONKY WELL CALIFORNIA BREWERIES HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SELL THEIR BEER DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS AT THEIR BREWERY BY THE TAP OR TAKE AWAY THE CALIFORNIA ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL ACT DOES NOT EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZE CALIFORNIA BREWERS TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS AWAY FROM THE LICENSE PRINCE THIS IS WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL THE BILL WILL CODIFY THAT CRAFT BREWERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHIP THEIR BEER DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS BUT TO AVOID FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THE STATE MUST ALLOW OUT OF STATE BREWERS SHIP IN THE STATE DO I LIKE THAT NO BUT IT'S THE LAW IT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE DON'T ALLOW THOSE ADDED STATE BREWERS THE SHIPPING IF WE DON'T ALLOW THOSE OUT OF STATE BROUGH RESEARCH SHIP IN THE CALIFORNIA WILL BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FEDERAL LEGAL CHALLENGES LIKE IT OR NOT CALIFORNIA MUST EXTEND THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY TO ADD A STATE BREWERS AND IT'S CALLED THE DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE WHICH PROHIBITS STATES FROM DISCRIMINATED AGAINST OUT OF STATE BUSINESSES BY THE WAY THIS IS THE SAME PRIVILEGE THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED THE WINE INDUSTRY FOR IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE WINERIES THIS HAPPENED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN THERE IS BLACK AND WHITE PRECEDENT FOR THIS AND AGAIN THE WAY BUSINESSES THRIVE AS WE ALL KNOW IS CERTAINTY THIS PROVIDES THE CERTAINTY THAT IS NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS SIXTY SIX THOUSAND EMPLOYEE JOB EMPLOYEE INDUSTRY STRONG TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING IS A LOT PROPERLY TO KEEP MANUFACTURING THE LOCAL BEERS THAT WE LOVE EVEN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE MOST CHALLENGING TIMES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND CALIFORNIA BREWERS CAN'T LOSE THIS LIFELINE SO I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH WHAT THE HELL THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BILL AS IN OUT OF STATE PERMIT HOLDER SO IF I'M SHIPPING FROM NEW YORK ALL RIGHT FOR MY BREWERY IN NEW YORK HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS BILL AND IT'S ALL RIGHT TO HAVE THE SERGEANTS BE ABLE TO BRING THE -- THE POSTER OVER JUST A BIT BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA POINT RIGHT TO IT SO NUMBER ONE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CONTAINERS TO BE LABELED ALONG WITH THE MANDATORY SIGNATURE BY PERSON OVER TWENTY ONE UPON DELIVERY NUMBER TWO EIGHT MANDATES ADDED STATE PERMIT HOLDERS MICHAEL IS IT OKAY IF WE BRING IT ALL THE WAY OVER THERE OKAY THANK YOU FOR MANDATE OUT A STATE PERMIT HOLDERS COLLECTOR IN THAT ALL SALES AND USE TAXES AND EXCISE TAXES ON SALES TO RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA UNDER THEIR DIRECT BEER PERMIT NUMBER THREE IT REQUIRES THAT PERMIT OFFICE HOLDERS MUST DEMONSTRATE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE RECYCLING LITTER REDUCTION ACT NUMBER FOUR REQUIRES A PERMIT HOLDERS MUST REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE STATE AND AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT TO PERFORM AUDITS OF PERMIT HOLDERS NUMBER FIVE AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC TO ENFORCE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL BY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE THE BEER DIRECTION PER PERMIT IF THIS ADDED STATE SHIPPER AND BREWER VIOLATES CALIFORNIA LAW THE BILL ALSO OUTLINES BRINGING ALCOHOL INTO THE STATE WITHOUT A PERMIT SO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YEAH SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM OPPOSITION AND I GET IT ABOUT SOME OF THE CLAIMS AND I WANNA CORRECT THE RECORD ON THIS BILL SO WE'VE HEARD A COULD CLAIM THAT THIS BILL JEOPARDIZES CALIFORNIA JOBS AND RETAILERS FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH I THINK THAT'S A BIT MARC SOMEONE AT TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA BREWERS SO FIRST OF ALL CALIFORNIA BREWERS CAN SHIP TODAY IN STATE BUT THE VAST VAST MAJORITY THE PIER THE BEER THAT IS PURCHASED BY CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS NOT BEING SHIPPED I IT IS BEING DISTRIBUTED AND DELIVERED TO BARS RESTAURANTS GROCERY STORES IN FACT IT'S ESTIMATED IN THE HIGH NINETY PERCENT RANGE AT THE HEIGHT NINETY PERCENT OF ALL BEER THAT IS AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS IN THE STATE IS PROUDLY IT'S PROBABLY DELIVERED BY WOMEN AND MEN REPRESENTED BY CALIFORNIA LABOR GOING TO RESTAURANTS GOING TO BARS IS WELL AS RETAIL NUMBER TWO AT THE STATE BREWERIES WHO TAKE THE RISK TO PARTICIPATE ARE NOT GONNA BE COMPETING WITH THE JOBS AND DISTRIBUTION OR RETAIL ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE IT SIMPLY COST TOO MUCH TO SHIP DIRECT TO CONSUMERS AND THIS IS WHERE THIS CHART COMES IN SO I'M GONNA START FROM THE FAR RIGHT AND WORK OUR WAY TO THE LEFT SO LET'S FIRST TAKE LEGACY BREWING IT'S AN IPA OUT OF NEW YORK SO RIGHT NOW IF I AM THE BREWERY AT A NEW YORK I AND I WANT TO SHIP SEVEN DAYS IT'S GOING TO COST THE CONSUMER THIRTY FIVE BUCKS THIRTY FIVE SIXTY TWO FOR HOW MUCH BEER FOR SIX PACK THANK YOU FOR A SIX PACK NOW IF I GO TO SAFEWAY ON NINETEENTH IN SACRAMENTO THAT THERE IS GOING TO COST EIGHT DOLLARS AND FORTY NINE CENTS TODAY NOW ILLINOIS' LET'S GO TO GO SILENT COMING OUT ILLINOIS RIGHT NOW IF I GO TO SAY FOUR NINETEENTH STREET IT'S SEVEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY NINE CENTS TO GET A SIX PACK THAT SIX PACK PROUDLY PROUDLY DISTRIBUTED DELIVERED TO THE STORE BY UNION LABOR AND IT'S SEVEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY NINE CENTS NOW I CAN'T GET SEVEN DAYS I CAN ONLY GET THREE DAY SHIPPING OUT OF ILLINOIS IT WOULD BE THIRTY THREE OH FOUR FOR THE SIX PACK IF YOU'RE REALLY DESPERATE FOR GOOSE ISLAND YOU CAN SPEND TO EARN SIX BUCKS AND GET IT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I WANNA JUMP THE ORGAN ORGAN IF I WANT TO GET A SIX PACK OF THE SHOOT UP WHICH I KNOW IS CENTER ARCHER LET HIS FAVORITE -- IN GOES TO SAFELY RIGHT NOW IT'S TEN DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS FOR TWO DAYS IT'S THIRTY BUCKS OR SIX PACK THE REASON WHY I BRING THIS UP IS WHY THE HELL IF I AM A JOE SITTING IN VENTURA COUNTY WHAT I SPEND THIRTY DOLLARS AN EIGHTEEN CENTS ON A TWO DAY DELIVERY FROM MORGAN WHEN I CAN GO TO SEVEN ELEVEN I CAN GO TO CIRCLE K.

FROM THE OTHER SIDE -- AND I'M VERY CLEAR YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE TO SEE AND I DISCUSSED WITH SOME OF OUR UNION MEMBERS YOU KNOW THE COMMON CARRIERS AND AND OTHER ISSUES THAT I THINK CAN BE A TRUST AS HE STATED IN AND HE SAID IT PUBLICLY -- THAT HE'S WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION NOW IN REGARDS TO I KNOW THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN WE HAVE THIS CONSTITUTE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE I MEAN AT THIS POINT I THINK ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO TO SEE AND STATE CELLS YOU KNOW DIVIDE IN THIS CASE I CAN SEE ARE HIS HANDS ARE TIED -- I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD IF IF -- IF

BOTH OF THESE PRIVILEGES HAVE EXISTED FOR DECADES UPON DECADES IT IS NOT DESTROYED OR IMPACTED THE THREE TIER SYSTEM IN ADDITION THE WINE INDUSTRY HAS HAD THE SAME EXACT PRIVILEGE FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS
