JOIN US AND THEN AT THAT POINT. MR VOEPEL WILL CONTINUE -- CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE WHILE I HAVE TO PRESENT A BILL IN IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PUT ME TO WORK TODAY. I DON'T NUMBER FOUR EIGHT BE. ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN GO AHEAD INSTEAD OF THE BATTLE OF THE PRESENT OKAY YOU GET A PRESENT THE OTHER OKAY. SO ITEM ONE AB.% FIVE SIXTY SEVEN MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IN TWENTY THIRTY THIS PROJECTED CALIFORNIANS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE WILL BECOME A LARGER SHARE OF THE POPULATION THE CHILDREN UNDER. EIGHTEEN MORE THAN HALF OF THIS POPULATION ON THE LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AT SOME POINT THEIR LIVES. YET THERE IS NO SINCE SUSTAINABLE OPTION -- FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH COGNITIVE OR PHYSICAL DISABILITIES TO OBTAIN AFFORDABLE LONG TERM CARE SERVICES MIDDLE CLASS SENIORS. AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL OR EXHAUST THEIR PERSONAL ASSETS FOR PRE PAYING FOR PRIVATE CARE. THAT'S WHY I'M OFFERING THIS BILL SB -- FIVE SIXTY SEVEN IT ESTABLISHES A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE TASK FORCE. CAN VIENEN BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THE PURPOSE OF THE TASK FORCES TO PROVIDE EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. IN ON THE COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE GUARD GROWING RECOGNITION OF CALIFORNIA'S DEMOGRAPHIC SHIPS IT IS AN OPPORTUNE TIME TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES AVAILABLE TO JUST TO CHART. SIX OF SIX A SUCCESSFUL PATH TO LONG TERM CARE SUSTAINABILITY -- I VERY MUCH YOU THIS IS A LITTLE MILLENNIAL ISSUE MY FAMILY WAS UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE FAMILIES IT WAS REALLY HARD HIT. BY THE RECESSION AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY HAD TO SPEND DOWN ALL OF THEIR RETIREMENT SECURITY TO TRY THAT. YEAH KEEP THE BUSINESS AFLOAT AND KEEP THEIR HOME WELL THAT RECESSION LASTED TOO LONG THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT SO NOT ONLY DID I LOSE A BUSINESS THEY ALSO HOME SO -- THERE'S NO RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR THEM SO THAT FALLS ON MYSELF AND OUR OTHER IT AND MY SIBLINGS -- TO TAKE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THAT THEY ARE. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE -- NOR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY THAT THEY ONCE HAD FOR WHEN THEY RETIRE SO -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT -- THERE ARE LESS PROVIDERS NOW THAN THERE USED TO BE THERE USED TO BE OVER HOW TO PROVIDE AS A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE NOW THERE'S YOU KNOW AROUND TEN PROVIDERS OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE WHICH ALSO -- DRIVES UP THE COST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AS MANY PROVIDER SO -- WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PROVIDING THE RETIREMENT SECURITY THROUGH LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AND IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FIGURES THIS OUT OF THIS TASK FORCE IS GOING TO HELP US GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN BECAUSE OF THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CAROL. SCHOOL FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THERE ARE NONE. WE APPRECIATE -- MISTER CALDERON BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- THIS IS THE ONE OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES ADDRESSING THE HUGE -- HURDLE WE FACE IN THE STATE OVER LONG TERM CARE. AND HOW TO PAY FOR IT -- THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO THE PARTNERSHIP FOR LONG TERM CARE TO LOOK AT A PROGRAM THAT IS. LONG NOT FUNCTIONING IN THE STATE THIS WOULD BE A FOLLOW ON TO THAT THAT WOULD. BRING THE BRING THE DISCUSSION TO THE LEVEL OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. BRINGING IN -- PEOPLE FROM THE INDUSTRY BRINGING IN EXPERTS. TO REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW DO WE CREATE A PRIVATE LONG TERM SHOULD LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET. THAT IS AFFORDABLE THAT IS ACCESSIBLE AND THAT ADDRESSES NEEDS OF PEOPLE. ON A ON ONGOING BASIS IN THE STATE -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE MEDI CAL THE COVERS PEOPLE WHO ARE -- IMPOVERISHED THEIR WORDS ARE VERY FEW OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS -- THERE IS AN EFFORT THROUGH -- THE SENATE -- SB FIVE TWELVE TO CREATE A STRUCTURE. TO LOOK AT TO CREATING A STATEWIDE INSURANCE PLAN THAT'S A DIFFERENT BALLGAME THAN THIS THAT IS A STEP ALONG THE WAY THAT WE HOPE EVENTUALLY WILL CREATE A STATE WIDE PROGRAM. BUT IN THE MEANTIME THIS BRINGS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE TO BEAR TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET HERE WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO CREATED ACCEPTABLE AN ACCESSIBLE. PRODUCT FOR PEOPLE SO WE ARE DRIVE VOTE. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM NOBODY RIGHT.

SYSTEM THAT ASSISTS OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CARE GIVERS IN OBTAINING ACCURATE INFORMATION AND TIMELY REFERRALS TO APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. A. B. TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN ALSO REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIVERSAL ASSESSMENT TOOL AND PROCESS TO STREAMLINE ACCESS TO SERVICES THROUGH A COORDINATED ASSESSMENT PROCESS. AND REQUIRES BY JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AS PART OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY -- TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSALIST ASMAN TOOL ALONG WITH A TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION.

ACCESSING THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO LIVE ON THEIR OWN TERMS AND IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. THEY OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN OR UP FOR HELP OR TO FIND THE SERVICES THEY NEED. THE PROBLEM IS MULTI FACETED AND STEMS FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE -- AT THE STATE LEVEL DEPARTMENTS OPERATE IN A FRAGMENTED FASHION OFTEN WITH LITTLE DATA SHARING AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT ACROSS PROGRAMS THIS RECOMMENDATION IMPACTS THE ABILITY. TO DELIVER SERVICES TO OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY. THE GROWTH OF THE AGING POPULATION WILL ONLY WORSEN AND THE NEXT DECADE OF THESE CHALLENGES BY DEVELOPING A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM. WE ENSURE THAT OUR SENIORS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED [inaudible] SEVEN GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MIMES BLAKE JOHNSON WHO BEHALF OF TEACHERS ARE FEELING AMMA WHO THE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB -- TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN I LIKE TO THINK THAT SOMEONE IS THERE IN FOR THESE IT WAS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND THIS IS A PERSONAL FOR STATES HAS A FEW ANA SHE EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND MANY CHALLENGES WHEN CAME FOR MOTHER AND A FATHER. AT THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER -- SHE FUNDS OF STRUGGLING TO ACCESS WHAT THEY NEEDED. OFTEN PLACING SEVERAL CALLS TO HELP YET WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF WHETHER SHE WAS GETTING WHAT THEY NEEDED -- CALIFORNIA'S AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION PROGRAMS OFFER SOLUTION SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS PROVIDING INFORM ASSISTANCE TO OLDER ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES AND FAMILIES. WHEN INFORMATION COUNSELING AND SERVICE COORDINATION TO HELP PEOPLE ACCESS WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT? UNFORTUNATELY THIS MARS AVAILABLE IN ONLY EIGHT COUNTIES AS PART OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN CALLS ON THE STATE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY. FOR STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION. INCREASING CALIFORNIA'S EARLY IN THIS OF DISABLED RESIDENTS QUALITY OF LIFE SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND FOR THESE REASONS. ARE STRICTLY EFFORT I BOTH AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. HELLO CRISTINA MILLS CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS THIS IS ONE OF OUR PRIORITY BILLS FOR THIS YEAR WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT. CAN I THIS IS ON ACTIVE AND FREED COULD I HAVE A FEW MINUTES AS AN EXPERT WITNESS POTENTIALLY TO TALK ABOUT THIS. NO LONGER BILL. OR DO I JUST GET A MINUTE OR LESS TWO MINUTES OKAY. SO AGAIN -- THIS IS A BILL THAT I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT -- FREE IS ONE OF TWENTY INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDING SERVICES TO PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF AGE AND TYPE OF DISABILITY. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS KIND OF ART NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM ON A LOCAL LEVEL. FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE THE AGING -- AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION OF NEVADA COUNTY IT'S A PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN THE AGENCY ON AGING AREA FOR AND FREED AND ABOUT ELEVEN EXTENDED PARTNERS FROM HOSPICE. OF THE FOOT HILLS TO OUR COUNTY ADULT SERVICES TO MEDICAL -- FQHC HEALTH CLINICS. AND IT'S REALLY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM -- FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS SERVICES THIS IS SOMETHING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT NOT JUST ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL BUT A PERSONAL LEVEL. I WAS INJURED IN A CAR ACCIDENT AT AGE FOURTEEN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE LOCAL INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER TO HELP MY FAMILY NAVIGATE. THE BENEFITS AND THE SERVICES THAT I NEEDED IT WOULD IT IT'S REALLY SCARY I LIKE TO SAY THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED DISABILITY THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO GO. AND THE SAME WITH AGING FOR THOSE OF US WHO AID FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR LIVES RIGHT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT RESOURCES ARE OUT THERE. AND MORE RECENTLY IN DECEMBER MY FATHER PASSED AWAY AND MY MOM WAS THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER FOR TWO YEARS. BEING SOMEONE WHO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH LPS HAS SYSTEMS. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE RIGHT EVEN ON A PERSONAL LEVEL FOR MY FAMILY. SO WE WORK TOGETHER TO INCREASE ACCESS TO A BROAD ARRAY OF SERVICES AND CONTINUE OF HELP IN ACCESSING SERVICES WE DO THIS WORK ON A LOCAL LEVEL TO NOT ONLY STREAMLINED ACCESS TO L. TSS REDUCE DUPLICATION. WE LEVERAGE LIMITED RESOURCES AND WE IDENTIFY GAPS IN SERVICES AT A LOCAL LEVEL -- BUT WE REALLY ARE IN NEED OF STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF NO LONGER SYSTEMS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES NEED SIMILAR SERVICES AS OLDER ADULTS THERE'S REALLY THIS FUNCTIONAL NEED PEACE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT REGARDLESS OF AGE PEOPLE NEED ACCESS TO THE SAME KIND OF SERVICES. AND THERE ARE THE SYSTEMS ARE SO SILO THEY'RE SO DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE -- THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. THREE NO WRONG DOOR AND LOOKING TO SEE IF WE CAN INCENTIVIZE WAYS FOR LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ACCESS TELL PEOPLE ACCESS SERVICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THEY TAKE CARE OF SENIORS AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE NOT TREATED WITH THE RESPECT AND THE FRANKLY PAY THE WAGES IN THE BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY DO. AND THIS BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC TO NEEDING TO HAVE PRIORITIZATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PAID AND UNPAID CARE GIVING WORK FORCE AND I I WANT TO SAY I FEEL. THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN CHANGE IN THE AIR IN THE LEGISLATURE -- PERHAPS WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR THERE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE HITTING CRITICAL MASS NOW WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY A DESIRE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES OF AGING AND THE WORK FORCE THAT. ACTUALLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO REMAIN AT HOME BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT WE SUPPORT THAT. BUT IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY PASSED POLICIES THAT MAKE THAT HAPPEN THEN YOU KNOW IT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP THANK YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU TO THE STATE TREASURER AND THE OTHER FOLKS WHO'VE -- INDICATED THAT THAT THIS IS A ISSUE THEY WANT TO CHAMPION THANK YOU TO OUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO HAVE IN THE PAST CHAMPION THIS. AND I I WANTED ONLY STRESS ONE THING RELATIVE TO THE BILL IT CALLS UPON THE NEED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT SUSTAINABLE FINANCING FINANCING MECHANISM. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WE CAN'T. DEAL WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT UNLESS WE DEAL WITH HOW WE WILL PAY THESE PEOPLE MORE MONEY WE CAN SAY THAT THEY'RE WORTH MORE MONEY. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MONEY EITHER COMES FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT OR COMES OUT OF PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOKS. AND IT HAS TO DO WE HAVE TO DEDICATE TIME AND IN A RESOURCES INTO FIGURING OUT WHAT SOURCE OF REVENUE IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE. IN THIS DAY POLITICALLY AND POSSIBLY. IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO DURING THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW SO I JUST WANT. TO LEAVE ON THAT NO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT WICKS.

ITEM NUMBER THREE AB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES MY NEIGHBOR. THANK YOU MY NEIGHBOR AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I WANT TO PRESENT TO YOU AB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH CREATES THE CALIFORNIA. CARE COR. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS NUMBER IS ONLY EXPECTED TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS THIS DEMOGRAPHIC REQUIRES A VARIETY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THE FAMILY CARE GIVER ALLIANCE ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS. OUR OUR PRESENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THESE CARE GIVERS ARE DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION. AS NOTED BY THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION. AND ONE IN FOUR OF THESE CARE GIVERS ARE MILLENNIALS MANY OF WHOM DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL OR FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT TO PROVIDE CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA CARE CORE OUT TO HOPES TO TACKLE BOTH THE WORK FOR SHORTAGE FOR LONG TERM CARE AS WELL AS PROVIDE RESPITE. FOR UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO ON OF TO ON AFFORDABLE CARE. THE CARE COR THE CALIFORNIA CARE CORPS PROGRAM OPERATES AS A YOUTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HOUSED UNDER CAL BALLING TEAR. AND ADMINISTERED SIMILARLY TO AMERICORPS. IT WILL TRADE IN MATCH YOUTH TO PROVIDE NON MEDICAL RESPITE CARE IN ORDER TO ASSIST UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS. GIVING THEM TIME AND FREEDOM TO RETURN TO SCHOOL OR REENTER THE WORKFORCE. MY UP MY OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND HOPES TO CONTINUE TO DO SO TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE AND TO MITIGATE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. TO OTHER AGING AND LONG TERM CARE PROGRAMS. WITH ME TO SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE NEED OF THIS PROGRAM. VICE PRESIDENT OF THE PROGRAM UP OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS OF ALZHEIMER'S SAN DIEGO JESSICA AND BEEN YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS JESSICA PENA AND I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT PROGRAMS THAT ALZHEIMER'S SAN DIEGO WE ARE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ALL OF THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE OUR FREE BUT I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ONE IN PARTICULAR. FOR SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA IS A DIFFICULT AND DEMANDING JOB FAMILIES NEED SUPPORT AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP AWAY FROM CARE RESPONSIBILITIES AND FOR MANY. THIS IS NOT EASY TO COORDINATE AND THE COSTS INVOLVED CAN OFTEN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE. WE SAW A REAL NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ALSO COMPANIONS WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE COMPANIONSHIP SOCIALIZATION AND SUPERVISION FOR PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA WHICH GIVES THEIR CARE GIVER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BREAK AND FOR MANY IT IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF REST BUT THEY HAVE. ALSO COMPANIONS IS THE ONLY VOLUNTEER BASED IN HOME DEMENTIA SPECIFIC RESPITE PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL IN THE UNITED STATES. FAMILIES ALSO RECEIVE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AN IN HOME ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FROM A SOCIAL WORKER AND A VOLUNTEER WITH WHOM THEY CAN BUILD A LONG TERM CONNECTION. PAID RESPITE PROGRAMS ARE UNABLE TO OFFER THIS LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO FAMILIES THUS INCREASING THE VALUE OF THIS TRULY ONE OF A KIND MODEL. SINCE LAUNCHING THE PROGRAM WE HAVE PROVIDED NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND HOURS OF FREE RESPITE TO THREE HUNDRED FAMILIES. THE IMPACT HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS AND WE SEE IT EVERY DAY IN TALKING TO FAMILIES. AS WELL AS THE FEEDBACK WE SEE A PROGRAM EVALUATIONS. 94% OF CARE GIVERS IN THE PROGRAM FEEL THEIR STRESS HAS BEEN REDUCED. 99% SAY THEY LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR RESPITE BREAKS AND 1100% WOULD RECOMMEND THE PROGRAM. BUT THIS PROGRAM WOULD NOT BE WHAT IT IS WITHOUT THE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY VOLUNTEERS THAT HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT. THEY RANGE IN AGE FROM EIGHTEEN TO EIGHTY ONE WITH 69% BEING BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINE MANY ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS PREPARING FOR CAREERS IN HEALTH CARE PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL WORK. AND HAVING THIS KIND OF INTERGENERATIONAL ASPECT TO THE PROGRAM WAS NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING WE PLANNED BUT IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL ELEMENT TO THE PROGRAM. DESPITE THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR ALSO COMPANIONS PROGRAM THERE IS STILL SO MUCH NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. AB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WILL PROVIDE CARE GIVERS WITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND RESPITE WHILE ALSO SERVING AS A YOUTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. ALZHEIMER'S SAN DIEGO IS PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HOPES YOU WILL DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU COMMENTS IN SUPPORT.

LACKEY HIGH RADIUS HI RES I RUBIO. RUBIO WHY THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU AB THIRTY NINETY SIX MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER TERRY LOOK GOOD WITH THAT GAVEL. SO -- I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THIS COMMITTEE THE TREMENDOUS PROBLEM THAT ELDER ABUSE IS IN CALIFORNIA -- I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT ONE IN TEN ELDERS IN THE STATE. HAS SUFFERED ELDER ABUSE IT OUT I WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT. ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FOURTEEN CASES OF ELDER ABUSE EVEN GETS REPORTED SO -- CALIFORNIA NOW HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF ELDER ABUSE OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. WHICH I FIND ASTONISHING AND IT'S JUST GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE OUR ELDER POPULATION IS GOING TO MORE THAN DOUBLE BY THE YEAR -- TWENTY TWENTY SIX THIS BILL AB THIRTEEN NINETY SIX IS A STE IN A SMALL WAY SEEKS TO DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM IT. ALLOWS A JUDGE TO IMPOSE. A CLINICAL COUNSELING OR ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES ON A BATTERER WHEN ISSUING AID -- ELDER ABUSE RESTRAINING ORDER JUDGES ALREADY HAVE THAT DISCRETION WHEN ISSUING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER I THINK IT MAKES GREAT SENSE TO ALLOW THEM THAT DISCRETION. WHEN -- ISSUING A ELDER ABUSE RESTRAINING ORDER ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO TRY AND LOWER. THIS -- INCIDENTS OF ELDER ABUSE AND GET OUT OF THE ON TO STERN THIS POSITION OF HAVING MORE ELDER ABUSE THAN ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD THING. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO ALONG HAVE THE COVERS A CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATION WHERE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. THIS BILL COMES -- FROM ACTUALLY SOME PROBATE JUDGES AN ORANGE COUNTY. WHO NOTICE THAT? THEY HAD MANY OF THE SAME NEEDS THAT -- THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE FAMILY LOVE BENCH HAD IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO CRAFT AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. TO ABUSE BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS. AND THAT'S WHAT AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY SIX IS ALL ABOUT WE'RE TRYING TO EXTEND. THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THE JUDGES ON THE PROBATE PENSION OR THE IN IN TAKING CARE OF THE ELDER ABUSE CASES. HAVE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO TRY TO CRAFTED APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. COMMENTS IN SUPPORT.

COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION. COME ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] YES MA'AM. I HAD ONE QUESTION -- THIS MANDATORY CLINICAL COUNSELING OR ANGER MANAGEMENT WITH THE SUPPLIED TO BOTH TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS AND PERMANENT RESTRAINING ORDERS. JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT MANDATORY IT'S LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPOSE IT -- MR DOOR OKAY ANSWERED IF IT'S APPLIES TEMPORARY AS WELL I WOULD THINK IT WOULD. YES I BELIEVE IN HIM POINTS TO BOTH. AND A I THINK NOT YEAH YEAH KEVIN COULD GO BEYOND THE EXTENT OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER.
