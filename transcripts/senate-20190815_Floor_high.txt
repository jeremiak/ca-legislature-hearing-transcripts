AND CREATING A MEANINGFUL PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP IN OUR COUNTRY. IT'S BEEN A DEBATE THAT I THINK HAS BEEN. OF DISCUSSED EVERY SINGLE HERE YEAR HERE ON THIS FLOOR AND IN THE LEGISLATURE YET. AS WE HAVE SENT SOLUTIONS TO WASHINGTON OF WHAT A IMMIGRATION REFORM IS THERE HAS A FAILURE TO ACT WE ONLY GET RHETORIC FROM WASHINGTON AND CURRENTLY. WE ARE SEEING SOME VERY AGGRESSIVE MEASURES BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. ODD. MEASURES THAT ARE HURTING OUR STATE'S ECONOMY WE'RE GETTING STORIES NOW OF FARMERS PLOWING THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND LABOR THERE'S A LABOR SHORTAGE NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE COUNTRY. AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY IN MY DISTRICT IS VERY BIG IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE. ON THE WAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FIND SKILLED LABOR. IS IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT FARMWORKERS ARE SKILLED LABOR OF THE OF THE FARM FARMERS YES A VERY IMPORTANT BUT THE FARMWORKERS ARE IS WELL. WHAT THEY DO REQUIRES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SKILL AND YEARS AND YEARS OF PRACTICE TO LEARN THEY ARE SKILLED LABOR SOONEST GONNA HAVE. AN ENORMOUS IMPACT OUR ECONOMY THIS IS SOMETHING THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO FIGHT FOR WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR OUR ECONOMY WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR THE FARMERS THAT ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING LABOR WE NEED TO FIGHT. FOR OTHERS WORKERS AS WELL. THAT ARE HERE TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO OUR STATE. AND WE IN TURN THEM SOMETHING IN RETURN SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER IT'S STARTING TO HAVE SERIOUS IMPACTS ON OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY'S ECONOMY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A VERY QUIET. A SCREAM COMING FROM OUR AGRICULTURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY FROM OUR FARMERS ARE NOW STARTING TO TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES A FLOAT. AND SO. THE YOU KNOW IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THERE IS NO. NO IMMIGRATION REFORM BEING CONSIDERED IN WASHINGTON WHAT QUITE THE OPPOSITE VERY AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS ARE BEING TAKEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DENY CITIZENSHIP TO THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES AND TO SEPARATE THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH VERY AGGRESSIVE. OF DEPORTATION POLICIES THEY'RE VIOLATING THESE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS SO I WOULD HOPE THAT IN THE INTERESTS OF OUR STATE IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND THE WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. AND THE AND THIS FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY IT'S BETWEEN A PART TORN APART THAT WE ALL STAND TOGETHER WITH THE LEAD AS A LEGISLATURE AND SENT A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON.

AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT RESOLUTION TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTRY. THE TEARS TO THE VALUES THAT WE.

THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD CENTER NIELSEN THE PRESIDENT LAID DOWN THE SENATE I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUT WITH A QUESTION. HE DOCTORAL EDUCATION UNDER THE MASTER PLAN OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE PURVIEW OF YOU SEE. AND THAT WAS CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SIXTIES ORIGINAL MASTER PLAN. WAS PUT INTO EFFECT IT'S WORKED VERY WELL BUT OVER THE DECADES IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DISCIPLINE AREAS WHERE I BELIEVE. AND OTHERS HAVE TO THAT A DOCTORAL EDUCATION AT THE CSU LEVEL WOULD BE APPROPRIATE NURSING WAS ONE EXAMPLE THIS IS ANOTHER ONE DOLLAR THOUGH URGING AN AYE VOTE AS WE PROCEED I WOULD SAY THAT WE SHOULD WAX CAUTIOUS ABOUT HOW MANY OF THESE DOCTOR OPPORTUNITIES WE PROVIDE.

I HAVE RAISED ON THIS BILL AND SOME OTHER BILLS AS WELL THAT UNFORTUNATELY ACTUALLY ARE HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS AT C. S. U. IN SOME EASIER COMMUNICABLE AGES. OUR CHALLENGE TO BECAUSE SOME OF THE- PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES FOR VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS. HAVE TRIED TO INCREASE THE CREDENTIALS AND THEREFORE REQUIRED HIGHER CREDENTIALS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE IN THAT PARTICULAR OCCUPATION. AND THIS UNFORTUNATELY IS. PUTTING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN A BIND SO WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE VISION THERAPY IDEOLOGY OR SOME OTHERS AND WELL IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING FOR US BECAUSE WE DON'T. OVERSEE THOSE OCCUPATIONS WE OVERSEE LICENSING WE OVERSEE OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS I THINK THERE IS A- PERHAPS CONVERSATION WE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD IN OUR SOCIETY ABOUT. THE PRICE OF INCREASING THOSE CREDENTIALS THIS IS ONLY ONE SOMETHING THE OTHER PROBLEM IS OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT STUDENT DEBT AND HOW MANY YEARS YOU NEED TO BE IN SCHOOL AND SO FORTH AS WELL.
