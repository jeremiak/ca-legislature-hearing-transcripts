00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:29.988
FOOTPRINT. THE TRANSMISSION

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:32.090
PLANNING IS REALLY DONE BASED ON

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:33.958
THREE MAJOR INPUTS. AND THAT IS

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.994
THE LOAD FORECAST WORK DEVELOPED

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.861
BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.796
COMMISSION. THE RESOURCE

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:40.164
PLANNING CONDUCTED BY THE PUBLIC

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.367
UTILITIES COMMISSION. AS WELL AS

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:44.135
ALL OF THE RELEVANT OF FEDERAL

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:46.838
AND STATE AND OUR EYES SO OWN

00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:47.372
PLANNING REQUIREMENTS AND

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:49.641
CRITERIA. EACH YEAR WE PRODUCES

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:51.242
ANNUAL TRANSMISSION PLAN THAT

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.278
THAT OBLIGATES SOMEONE TO TRY TO

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:54.445
ACTUALLY GET THAT TRANSMISSION

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:56.247
BUILT. AND GENERALLY THE

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:58.149
TRANSMISSION FALLS INTO MEETING

00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:00.184
THE NEEDS OF RELIABILITY NEEDS.

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.753
ACCESS TO RENEWABLE GENERATION

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:04.022
TO IS TO ACHIEVE STATE GOALS. AS

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.323
WELL AS LOOKING FOR TRANSMISSION

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.492
UPGRADES THAT CAN ALSO. HELP

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:09.327
LOWER THE OVERALL DELIVERED COST

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:11.095
OF ELECTRICITY BY ACCESSING

00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:13.231
LOWER COST RESOURCES. TO THOSE

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:14.899
OF THE KEY MAIN INPUTS THAT

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:17.735
REUSING. AND IN ALL THREE OF

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:20.171
THOSE AREAS WERE HAVING TO ADAPT

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:21.172
AND CHANGE. ACTUALLY IF I COULD

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:24.275
JUST MOVE. ALL PASSED THIS SLIDE

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:25.877
THIS LARGELY HAS THE WORDS I

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.612
JUST SPOKE TO AT CENTER SPEND

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.380
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES ON THIS-

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.082
THE GRAPH THAT YOU SEE AS PART

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:32.917
OF WHAT'S DEMONSTRATING THE NEED

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.585
TO ESCALATE THE PACE OF

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:35.086
DEVELOPMENT. THAT GRAPH

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.355
REPRESENTS THE- LOAD GROWTH

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.623
PROJECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.425
ENERGY COMMISSION. THE LOWER

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:41.559
BLUE LINE WAS THERE

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.561
COMPREHENSIVE FORECAST DEVELOPED

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.330
TWO YEARS AGO. THE RED LINE

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:47.265
CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IS THE

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:48.800
CURRENT FORECAST LOOKING OUT

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:50.768
OVER THE NEXT DECADE SO THIS IS

00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:51.969
DEMONSTRATING ASIGNIFICANT

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:53.571
INCREASE IN LOAD GROWTH

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.406
ESPECIALLY AS WE SEE TRANSFER

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.442
ME- OTHER INDUSTRIES AND

00:32:57.508 --> 00:32:59.410
TRANSPORTATION. TRANSITION TO

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:02.647
ELECTRICITY TO REDUCE THEIR OWN

00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:03.781
CARBON FOOTPRINT. THE DIRECT

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:05.616
IMPACT OF THAT THAT'S ALSO ONE

00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:06.884
OF OUR OTHER INPUTS INTO OUR

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.419
PLANNING PROCESSES THE IMPACT IT

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.488
HAS ON PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:12.623
COMMISSION RESOURCE PLANNING.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.258
THE PLANS WE BASED LAST YEAR'S

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.794
TRANSMISSION PLAN ON WERE KEY TO

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.363
ADDING A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.365
NEW RESOURCES A YEAR OVER THE

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:22.800
NEXT DECADE. THE PLAN OR BOARD

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:24.435
JUST APPROVED IN MARCH OF THIS

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:26.371
YEAR WAS TIED TO A PACE OF

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:27.372
TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS A

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:29.107
YEAR. AND A PLAN WE'RE NOW

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:31.109
WORKING ON IS KEY TO RESOURCE

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.311
PLANS CALLING FOR OVER FOUR

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:34.345
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS TO BE ADDED

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:36.347
EACH YEAR OVER THE NEXT DECADE.

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:38.082
SO THAT RAMPING UP BOTH OF LOAD

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.717
REQUIREMENTS CUSTOMER DEMAND

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:41.586
REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS THE

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:42.620
RESOURCES NEEDED TO SERVE FULL

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.956
LOAD. AND MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.791
RETIRING RESOURCES IS OBVIOUSLY

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.659
GOING TO DRIVE AN ACCELERATION

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:52.230
OF OUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:52.797
INITIATING NEW TRANSMISSION

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.799
PROJECTS. IF I COULD MOVE TO THE

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:57.301
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE OTHER

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:58.870
CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS THAT THE

00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:00.671
GOOD NEWS IS COMPETITION FOR

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:02.273
PROVIDING THOSE RESOURCES IS

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.875
VERY MUCH ALIVE AND WELL AT

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:06.177
TIMES WE ALSO FACE THOUGH A BIT

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:07.178
OF AN ABUNDANCE OF RICHES OUR

00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:09.113
CURRENT INTERCONNECTION QUEUE.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.350
IS SITTING AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.985
FIVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.453
ASSETS SEEKING TO CONNECT TO OUR

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.522
SYSTEM. THAT IS A GREAT DEAL OF

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:18.523
COMPETITION FOR A MUCH SMALLER

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:20.625
AMOUNT OF AUTHORIZED PROCUREMENT

00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:22.393
JUST TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT-

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.162
LAST JUNE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:25.363
COMMISSION AUTHORIZED THEIR

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.832
SINGLE LARGEST EVER. A RESOURCE

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.768
AUTHORIZATION WHICH WAS FOR

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:34.439
ELEVEN POINT FIVE GIGAWATTS OR

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:35.440
ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:36.174
MEGAWATTS OF RESOURCES. OUR

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.542
CURRENT INTERCONNECTION QUEUE IS

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.243
STANDING UP WELL OVER TWENTY

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.379
TIMES THAT AMOUNT. SO WINNOWING

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:42.914
DOWN THROUGH THE AMOUNT OF

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.749
PROJECTS APPLYING TO GET

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.751
CONNECTED AS THEY ARE ALSO

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:47.852
SEEKING. TO GET TOP POWER

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.387
PURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:51.122
WITH UTILITIES AND OTHER LOAD

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.424
SERVING ENTITIES. IS OBVIOUSLY A

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:55.560
CHALLENGER HAVING TO DEAL WITH.

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:58.196
LAST YEAR ALONE WE ADDED OVER A

00:34:58.262 --> 00:35:00.131
HUNDRED OF ALMOST A HUNDRED AND

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:02.066
FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF. OF

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.402
ASSETS TO THE INTERCONNECTION

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:05.937
QUEUE SEEKING TO GET CONNECTED.

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:07.939
AND AS I SAID COMPETITION IS

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:09.607
GOOD BUT THIS LEVEL OF

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:10.975
COMPETITION DISTRACTS FROM THE

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.076
PROJECTS THAT WILL BE MOVING

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:14.345
FORWARD JUST BECAUSE OF THE

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:16.948
SHEER VOLUME. IF I COULD MOVE TO

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:19.417
THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.952
YEAR'S TRANSMISSION PLAN THAT I

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:23.354
ALREADY MENTIONED- HAS BEEN

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:24.455
MOVING FORWARD SHOWING THAT

00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:27.024
ACCELERATION OVER THE TEN YEARS

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.926
WE'VE CALLED FOR AN ADDITIONAL

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.394
TWENTY THREE PROJECTS TOTALING

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:32.330
TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN COST.

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:34.165
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.299
BEEN AVERAGING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:37.335
AND FIFTEEN MILLION A YEAR AND

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:38.469
CAPITAL IN OUR TRANSMISSION

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:41.772
PLANT SO THIS IS MORE THAN A TEN

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:42.907
FOLD INCREASE. WE ALSO TOOK THE

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.775
STEP OF TRIGGERING THIS YEAR OF

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.010
DEVELOPING A TWENTY YEAR

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:47.979
TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK. THAT IS

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.947
NOT AN APPROVAL DOCUMENT IT WAS

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:52.116
A WAY TO PROVIDE SOME LONGER

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:53.885
TERM VISION FOR WHAT THE GREAT

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:55.119
BUT LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. TO

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:57.989
MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF GETTING

00:35:58.055 --> 00:36:01.259
TO A 100% CARBON FREE. AND THAT

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:04.428
HELPS PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR.

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.963
PLANNING DECISIONS SO WE HAVE TO

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.266
MAKE IN THE NEAR TERM AND SETS

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.635
OUT LONGER TERM STRATEGY OUT-

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:13.938
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE LAST

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.239
THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON WAS

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:17.208
JUST AHEAD ON SOME OF THE KEY

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:19.277
AREAS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WE

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:20.011
THINK THERE CAN BE PROCESS

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:20.978
IMPROVEMENTS THAT RECOGNIZING

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.446
THE VOLUME OF TRANSMISSION THAT

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.682
NEEDS TO BE PLANTED BUILT. AND

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:26.617
THAT IS BOTH THE NETWORK

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:27.785
UPGRADES AS WELL AS THE

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.220
INTERCONNECTION FACILITIES THAT

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:30.922
ARE NEEDED FOR THESE RESOURCES

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:33.257
TO PIPE TO THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:34.025
THE SIR CUSTOMER LOAD AT THE

00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:36.661
OTHER END SO FIRST ANYTHING THAT

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:38.162
CAN BE DONE OF COURSE TO

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:39.564
STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.231
PROCESS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:43.467
PROCESS. IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:45.036
THE TIME LINES THAT CAN TAKE FOR

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:47.171
AT TIMES HAVING TO REVISIT THE

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.873
NEED FOR CERTAIN TRANSMISSION

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.708
FACILITIES LATER IN THE PROCESS

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:52.743
CAN ADD YEARS TO GETTING CERTAIN

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.079
pTRANSMISSION BILL AND WHILE WE

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:57.114
ALWAYS AGREE THAT- THESE

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.449
DECISIONS NEED TO BE PROPERLY

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:00.351
VETTED SOMETIMES THE TIMING IS

00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:03.020
AN ISSUE OF WHEN THEY'RE BEING

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.288
VETTED AND HOW. ALSO POWER

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:05.656
PURCHASE AGREEMENTS BEING PUT IN

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:07.558
PLACE RIGHT NOW ARE LARGELY JUST

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.327
FOCUSED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:12.029
OUT. LONGER TERM PROCUREMENT TO

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:13.598
IDENTIFY WHICH PROJECTS WOULD BE

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.766
MOVING FORWARD. WHAT HELPED US

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.902
FOCUS OUR PRECIOUS ENGINEERING

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.837
RESOURCES ON THE PROJECTS THAT

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.472
ARE MOVING FORWARD. INSTEAD OF

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:24.342
KEEPING SOMEBODY ALIVE FOR NEAR

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.210
TERM COMPETITION. WE'RE ALSO

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:28.045
CONCERNED WHERE THIS IS NOT AS

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:30.114
MUCH OF AN ISSUE FOR THE ICE OF

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:32.416
IT PERHAPS FOR THE REST OF THE

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:33.484
INDUSTRY AND IN ACHIEVING THESE

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:34.452
OUTCOMES WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:37.054
THE OVERALL. VOLUME OF RESOURCES

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:39.690
AVAILABLE TO ENGINEER AND BUILD

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.292
ALL OF THE FACILITIES THAT NEED

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:43.060
TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND TO US

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.662
THAT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE WE

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.130
WON'T SOLVE THAT JUST BY HIRING

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.733
OR STAFF AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:49.800
IT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE. AND

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.602
LASTLY WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:53.004
OUR OWN PROCESSES AND WE HAVE A

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.772
NUMBER OF ACTIVE STAKEHOLDER

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.474
PROCESS IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.242
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO OPTIMIZE OUR

00:37:58.309 --> 00:38:00.378
OWN TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:01.045
GENERATION INTERCONNECTION

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:03.147
PROCESSES. THESE OF OFTEN BEEN

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.549
HELD UP ACTUALLY AND- BY THE

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.351
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:08.085
COMMISSION OF SOME OF THE BEST

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:10.287
IN CLASS. BUT WE DO HAVE TO SEE

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.189
IF THERE'S ANY OPPORTUNITY TO

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.491
GET ANY EFFICIENCIES AND

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:15.292
IMPROVEMENTS OUT OF THOSE

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:17.261
PROCESSES AS WELL. SO I'VE

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.296
COVERED A LOT OF GROUND TO LOOK

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:19.997
FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION BUT

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.232
THAT WRAPS UP. THE INITIAL

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:22.600
COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:24.101
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:26.370
YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT-

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:29.373
MISTER MARK. RATHER NO I GUESS

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.008
ONE THING I'D LIKE TO ADD AS A-

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:33.411
AS WE ALL KNOW. THE IMPORTANCE

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:35.913
OF GETTING. A NEW GENERATION NEW

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.182
RESOURCES ON CLEAN RESOURCES

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.250
CLEAN IT'S A CLEAN FLEXIBLE

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:40.951
RESOURCE ON. IS BECOMING EVER

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:44.055
MORE CRITICAL- AS YOU ARE WHERE

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:46.023
WE RECENTLY INDICATED THAT THIS

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.859
YEAR WE STILL SEE. DEFICIENCIES

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:51.062
THAT POTENTIALLY PUT THE SYSTEM

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:53.297
IN VULNERABILITY AT LEAST A HIGH

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:54.932
LOW LEVELS IN EXTREME

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:55.633
CONDITIONS. CERTAINLY CLIMATE

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.135
CHANGE IS IMPACTING US BOTH IN

00:38:58.202 --> 00:39:00.971
TERMS OF WILDFIRE RISKS- BUT

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:03.340
ALSO JUST- THE- RISK OF HIGH

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.642
TEMPERATURES AND HIGH LOADS

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:08.045
ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND ALLOWING

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:09.947
US TO MOVE THE GET THE SOME OF

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.849
THESE ARE. OLDER RESOURCES

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:14.085
RETIRED. SOME OF THAT'S GONNA

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:15.486
TAKE RESOURCES BUT IT'S ALSO

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:17.054
GONNA TAKE CURRENT MISSION. AND

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.322
WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN A

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.191
COORDINATED WAY WHERE THE

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:21.358
TRANSMISSION THE SERVICE PORTAL

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:23.360
RESOURCES AS IN PLACE. IN THE

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.196
RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT PLACE.

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:27.231
THAT COORDINATES WITH THAT AND I

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.866
THINK THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:31.869
MESSAGE. THAT THE ANNUAL

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.237
CONTAINER HERE FROM US THANK YOU

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:35.372

COMMISSION. AND OUR MISSION IS

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:02.533
TO ADVOCATE FOR AFFORDABLE SAFE

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.270
RELIABLE UTILITY SERVICES- CAN

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.439
YOU MOVE THAT SLIDE TO I'M HERE

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:10.074
TO SPEAK ABOUT THE COST IMPACTS

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.176
OF THE TRANSMISSION BUILD OUT-

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.445
AND OFFER AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:16.213
WE MIGHT WANT TO STUDY TO SEE IF

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.916
WE CAN MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.417
COSTS- WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:22.453
WILL NEED- NEW TRANSMISSION IF

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.355
ONLY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF

00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:25.823
NEW CHEN GENERATION WIND AND

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.225
SOLAR. THAT WILL REQUIRE IT- WE

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:29.460
ALSO KNOW THAT WILL NEED TO

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.395
DEVELOP THIS IN A QUICKER TIME

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:33.397
FRAME THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST-

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.832
AND FINALLY GIVEN THE RATE

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.634
PRESSURES THAT WE'RE FACING WE

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.335
WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO TRY TO

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:40.070
CONTROL THE COST AND CERTAINLY

00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:41.906
CONTROL THE GROWTH IN THE COSTS.

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.107
IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GONNA

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:45.075
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:47.044
HAPPENING WITH RATES TODAY- I

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.547
WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW THE

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.849
TRANSMISSION INVESTMENTS IMPACT

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:53.617
RATES AND WHAT THEIR TRAJECTORY

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.352
AS AND FINALLY- AND WITH A FEW

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:58.222
DIFFERENT IDEAS ON THINGS THAT

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.357
WE CAN STUDY T AMELIORATE THIS

00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:03.828
PROBLEM. IF YOU CAN GO TO THE

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:04.895
NEXT SLIDE- EDUCATION SEE FROM

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:07.798
THIS SLIDE RATES HAVE INCREASED

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:09.600
SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE TWENTY

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.135
FOURTEEN EXCEEDING THE RATE OF

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:13.170
INFLATION THESE FIGURES WERE

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:15.773
PROVIDED BY THE STAFF AT THE

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.441
PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. THE

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:18.642
BLACK LINE AT THE BOTTOM

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:19.877
REPRESENTS THE CONSUMER PRICE

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.913
INDEX OVERALL YOU KNOW EACH

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.049
UTILITIES RESIDENTIAL AVERAGE

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:28.953
RATE HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.120
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. GO

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:33.991
TO THE NEXT SLIDE. ON THIS SLIDE

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.626
WHAT WE'RE DEMONSTRATING HERE IS

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:36.927
THAT WITH IN THESE RATE

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:39.263
INCREASES TRANSMISSION COSTS ARE

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:39.997
TAKING UP HIGHER AND HIGHER

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:42.299
PERCENTAGE THAT MEANS THEY'RE

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:46.170
PUSHING RATES UP- AND THIS IS

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:48.639
HAPPENING FOR AGAIN ALL OF THE

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:51.342
BIG THREE UTILITIES- IF YOU CAN

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:54.111
GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- AND ON

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:55.846
THIS SLIDE WE'RE SHOWING THAT

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.715
WHAT THE ACTUAL TRANSMISSION

00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:01.118
COSTS. HAVE BEEN. SINCE TWO

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.354
THOUSAND AND NINE- COSTS HAVE

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.556
INCREASED OVER THREE HUNDRED

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:08.192
PERCENT- TRANSMISSION COSTS ARE

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:09.760
RECOVERED FROM THE FEDERAL

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:11.629
ENERGY THROUGH. TRANSMISSION

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:14.265
OWNERS MAKING A FILING TO THE

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:15.199
TRIP TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:17.835
REGULATORY COMMISSION. THIS IS

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.069
COLLECTED THROUGH FROM THE RATE

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:21.772
PAYERS VIA BOTH A HIGH VOLTAGE

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.908
TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE WHICH

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:26.043
IS FOR FACILITIES. TWO HUNDRED

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.279
KV AND ABOVE AND A LOW VOLTAGE

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:29.947
TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE AT

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:32.983
BELOW TWO HUNDRED- CAVESE. THE

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.252
FIRST IS PAID FOR BY ALL OF THE

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.086
CUSTOMERS IN THAT CASE-

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:37.922
TERRITORY THE SECOND IS PAID BY

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:39.089
THE CUSTOMERS OF EACH OF THE

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:42.359
INDIVIDUAL I- USE WHERE IT TAKES

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:45.496
PLACE- AND AGAIN AS YOU CAN SEE.

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:47.564
THIS CHART SHOWS THAT THE YOU

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.866
KNOW THE GROWTH OF THE HIGH

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:53.237
VOLTAGE TACK SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:55.172
AND NINE IF YOU CAN MOVE THIS

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.874
NEXT SLIDE. WHAT WE WANT TO SHOW

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:58.575
HERE IS THAT THE TACK IS

00:42:58.642 --> 00:42:59.710
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. TO

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:04.081
INCREASE FURTHER- AS- THE

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:05.616
REPRESENTATIVE SOME KAITO

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:08.919
ALLUDED TO- RECENTLY THERE WILL

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.955
THEY PUT FORWARD THEIR TWENTY

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:13.324
YEAR TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK- AND

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.858
THIS DOES EXPLORE THE LONGER

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.360
TERM GRADE REQUIREMENTS AND HOW

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.395
WE WILL MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:20.798
GOALS. RELIABLY AND COST

00:43:20.864 --> 00:43:23.467
EFFECTIVELY- WHAT THIS CHART

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:25.469
SHOWS IS THAT BY TWENTY FORTY TO

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:28.339
BASED ON OUR CALCULATIONS USING-

00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:31.408
THE TAX CALCULATOR PROVIDED BY

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:35.713
OKAY SO WE'LL SEE A 90% INCREASE

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:36.613
TO THIRTY ONE DOLLARS A MEGAWATT

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.184
HOUR- SO JUST TO RECAP. YOU KNOW

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.719
WE'RE ALREADY IN A SITUATION

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.721
WHERE RATES ARE INCREASING

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.690
SIGNIFICANTLY. ADMISSION COSTS

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:47.858
FOR ONE DRIVER OFTHOSE RATE

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:50.661
INCREASES AND THERE ARE OTHERS

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.563
AS WELL. TO MEET OUR CLIMATE

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:53.464
OBJECTIVES AND TO HAVE A

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.499
RESILIENT RELIABLE SYSTEM. WE'RE

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.101
GONNA NEED MORE TRANSMISSION SO

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:59.303
THESE COSTS WILL GO- THE

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.904
QUESTION WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.272
FORWARD IS KIND OF WHAT CAN WE

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:04.842
DO ABOUT IT- AND WE WOULD LIKE

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:07.945
TO SEE WORK. IN THE FOLLOWING

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:09.947
AREAS SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:11.415
SLIDE. ONE THING THAT AFFECTS

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.816
THE COST OF TRANSMISSION IS HOW

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.251
YOU FINANCE IT- WE'RE NOT

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.853
ADVOCATING ANY PARTICULAR WAY

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.688
WITH THE SLIDE DOES IS IT

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:19.857
ILLUSTRATES. FOR DIFFERENT

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:22.659
FINANCING MODELS- JUST TO SHOW

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:24.361
HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT THINGS LIKE

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:26.230
THE RATE OF RETURN AND WHETHER

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:27.698
YOU'RE FINANCING WITH DEBT OR

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:31.702
EQUITY- CAN HAVE ON THIS. I'M

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:33.637
SECOND YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:36.473
SLIDE- WE ARE ALSO OPTIMISTIC

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.277
THAT- IN THE FUTURE- ADVANCED

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:43.313
TECHNOLOGIES WILL HOPEFULLY HELP

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.149
US AVOID INTO FOR TRANSMISSION

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:46.984
COSTS AND I THINK. YOU KNOW THE

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:49.019
QUESTION WE WANT TO ASK IS YOU

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:50.788
KNOW CAN THESE TECHNOLOGIES NEW

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:52.156
TECHNOLOGIES CAN INCREASING

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:55.426
EFFICIENCIES TO SMART WIRES. CAN

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:56.960
THE SCALING OF BATTERIES CAN

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.529
THAT HELP RELIEVE CONGESTION AND

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:01.065
LOAD POCKETS CAN IT HELP US TO

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.499
COST EFFECTIVELY DEFERRED

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:03.901
TRANSMISSION IS NOT REALLY COST

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.069
EFFECTIVE IF YOU BUILD SOMETHING

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:06.103
THEN A COUPLE YEARS LATER YOU

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.372
HAVE TO BUILD TRANSMISSION AGAIN

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.074
SO YOU WANT TO WANT TO LOOK AT

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.042
THAT- ENDED DO THIS WE NEED TO

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:13.544
BE REALLY BEING DISCIPLINED IN

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.145
PILOTING DEMONSTRATIONS.

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:15.879
LEARNING FROM OTHER

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:18.549
JURISDICTIONS STRESS TESTING THE

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:20.684
SOLUTION SO THAT THEY MEET ALL

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:21.718
THE REQUIREMENTS OF ROUND

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:22.953
RELIABILITY- AND FIGURE OUT HOW

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.589
WE CAN SCALE THEM AND IN

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:26.824
PARTICULAR WE'RE INTERESTED IN

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.827
WHAT. EITHER BOB IT'S EITHER AN

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:31.528
INCLUDING BEHIND THE METER

00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:32.463
BATTERIES ELECTRIC VEHICLE

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.465
BATTERIES AND ALL OF THE

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:35.899
BATTERIES THAT WERE INVESTING IN

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.301
THE BULK POWER SYSTEM YOU KNOW

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:39.970
WHAT POTENTIAL CAN THEY HAVE YOU

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:41.738
KNOW TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:42.272
THESE CONCERNS. AND THEN

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.241
FINALLY- IF YOU CAN GO TO THE

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:46.610
NEXT SLIDE. WE'RE REALLY

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:48.879
CONCERNED ABOUT TRANSMISSION

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:51.348
COST OVERRUN. LARGE TRANSMISSION

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.383
PROJECTS HAVE A HISTORY OF COST

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.953
OVERRUNS- A TWENTY NINETEEN

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.287
STUDY BY THE BATTLE BRATTLE

00:45:57.354 --> 00:46:00.157
GROUP OF EIGHTEEN- CALLIE SO

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:02.359
APPROVED PROJECTS SHOWS THAT IN

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:06.363
OUR THERE WAS AN AVERAGE. COST

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.664
ESCALATION OF 40% WHY NINE

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:09.967
PHYLLIS SOME OF THE MORE-

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:11.502
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF SOME OF

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:13.937
THESE COST OVER RUNS. IN I THINK

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:16.206
WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHY IS

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.942
THIS HAPPENING- WHAT ROLE IS

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.812
SITING AND PERMITTING- AND THE

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:23.347
DELAYS CAUSED IN THERE WHAT

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:25.516
ROLES THAT PLAYING IN THESE COST

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:27.551
OVER RUNS. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:29.219
DUE TO POOR PROJECT PLANNING OR

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:31.922
POOR EXECUTION. AND THEN FINALLY

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:35.526
CAN WE DEVELOP. INCENTIVES FOR

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:37.361
WAYS TO HELP SHIELD RATEPAYERS

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:39.363
FROM SOME OF THE RISKS OF COST

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:42.833
OVERRUNS SO- AND I I'LL JUST SAY

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.401
YOU KNOW TO SCALE THE CLEAN

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.270
ENERGY BUILD OUT AND THE SCALE

00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.871
THE TRANSMISSION BUILD OUT.

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.473
REALLY GOING TO NEED TO ADDRESS

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.375
SOME OF THESE COST ISSUES AND

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:52.776
REALLY BE MINDFUL OF THAT.

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:55.245
FINALLY IN CONCLUSION YOU KNOW

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.813
IN A DECARBONISE WORLD WE'RE

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.781
GONNA NEED MORE CLEAN

00:46:57.848 --> 00:47:00.551
ELECTRICITY ORGANIZED A LOT MORE

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:01.618
CLEAN ELECTRICITY- CARDS CURRENT

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:03.086
DRAFTED THAT SCOPING PLAN

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.621
ENVISIONS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:07.191
ELECTRICITY THAT'S CLEAN. FOR

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:09.259
TRANSPORT BUILDING AND INDUSTRY-

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.027
WE HAVE A SYSTEM THE

00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:11.862
TRANSITIONING TO RUNNING MORE

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:15.199
AND MORE ON WIND AND SOLAR- AND

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:16.633
THIS WILL REQUIRE MORE

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.868
TRANSMISSION. YOU KNOW SO WE

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:19.369
HAVE TO BUILD THIS OUT IN AN

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:20.637
ENVIRONMENT WHERE RATES AND

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:22.272
BILLS HAVE INCREASED FASTER THAN

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.074
INFLATION. UNTIL WE REALLY GOT

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:26.109
AGAIN LOOK AT YOU KNOW CAN WE

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:29.112
CONTROL THESE COSTS. AND JUST TO

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.481
REITERATE. WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME

00:47:31.548 --> 00:47:34.151
CONSIDERATION- ARE STUDYING OF

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:35.953
DIFFERENT WAYS TO FINANCE THESE

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.155
PROJECTS THAT FIT WITHIN. HOW WE

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:40.123
DO THINGS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.160
WANT TO SEE- AND EMPHASIS-

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:45.195
CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON LOOKING TO

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:47.297
NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND WE REALLY

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:49.299
WANT TO SEE A WAY TO HELP

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:51.602
ADDRESS COST OVER RUNS INCLUDING

00:47:51.668 --> 00:47:53.237
BUT NOT LIMITED TO ADDRESSING

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:54.438
SITING PERMITTING AND

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.240
CONSTRUCTION DELAYS. THANK YOU

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.742
MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU I'M GONNA

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:00.110
PAUSE HERE AND ASK ANY OF MY

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:01.445
COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:03.547
QUESTIONS FOR YOURSELF OR FOR

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:06.483
THE FIRST TWO. PRESENTERS DR.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.753
THANK YOU- FIRST I THINK- FOR MR

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.056
MILLER. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.658
THESE TRANSMISSION COSTS ARE

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:18.996
DIVIDED. HOW MUCH IS IT TOO- HOW

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:20.964
MUCH OF THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:23.233
TO REACH OUT TO NEW GENERATION

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.269
SITES. OUT IN THE DESERT FOR

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:27.871
SOLAR OR WIND. AND HOW MUCH IS

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:31.708
DUE TO INCREASED- USAGE MORE

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:34.478
LECTER COMBS MORE LOCKED

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:38.115
VEHICLES AT CETERA. IT IS IT'S

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:40.417
STILL HERE WITH THE AYE SO THE-

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.618
AND IN OUR ANNUAL TRANSMISSION

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:43.053
PLANNING PROCESS WE'RE VERY

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.022
SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT'S DRIVING

00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:46.290
THE NEED FOR EACH TRANSMISSION

00:48:46.356 --> 00:48:48.025
UPGRADE. WE HAVEN'T TRIED TO GO

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.993
BACK AND REASSESS THOUGH EXACTLY

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.528
TO SAY WELL THIS IS THE IMPACT

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:53.463
ON RATES FROM THIS TYPE OF

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.499
PROJECT VERSUS THAT TYPE.

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:56.633
BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.035
WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO PICK

00:48:58.101 --> 00:48:59.736
THE BEST OVERALL TRANSMISSION

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:01.972
SOLUTION IT'S RARE THAT THOSE

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.140
ARE JUST MEETING A SINGLE

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:05.175
PURPOSE SURE SO SOME OF THE

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.244
PROJECTS ARE QUITE CLEAR WE CAN

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:08.478
IDENTIFY SOME MAJOR PROJECTS

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:09.579
THAT WERE DESIGNED TO REACH OUT

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.882
INTO NEW AREAS AND ACCESS YOU

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:14.418
NEW RESOURCES. BETTER WITHIN THE

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:15.986
LARGER NETWORK ITSELF QUITE

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:17.621
OFTEN OUR SOLUTIONS ARE A

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.589
COMBINATION OF HELPING US MEET

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:21.558
THE LOAD RELIABILITY NEED AND

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.160
ALSO HELPING ACCESS FROM

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:25.395
RENEWABLE GENERATION. AND THAT'S

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:28.432
PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN THIS

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:28.999
YEAR'S TRANSMISSION PLANT.

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:31.001
WITHOUT APPROVAL FOR A- A NEW

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.803
MAJOR FIVE HUNDRED KV SUBSTATION

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:34.671
THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:36.540
RELIABILITY BENEFITS INTO THE

00:49:36.606 --> 00:49:38.542
AREA. AND ALSO PROVIDE BETTER

00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:40.644
ACCESS TO NORTHERN SACRAMENTO

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.879
VALLEY RENEWABLE RESOURCES SO

00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:44.147
SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:46.049
MEETING MULTIPLE PURPOSES BUT WE

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:48.151
DO TRY TO GIVE THE KEY

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:48.785
INDICATORS IN OUR TRANSMISSION

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:51.388
CLASS. I DO NOT TO HAVE A RATE

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:53.590
IMPACT OF ONE VERSUS THE OTHER

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:54.591
I'M AFRAID ALL RIGHT WELL. I

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:56.059
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:58.028
NEED TO THINK ABOUT- AND I

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:00.163
PARTICULARLY HERE. WOULD LIKE

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.633
TO- GET ANY COMMENTS THAT THE-

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.569
MISTER BAKER IS WILLING TO THINK

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.270
ABOUT THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:10.640
EQUITY CONCERNS HERE AND- YOU

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:15.278
HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. VERY LOW

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.681
USAGE AND ALSO WHO SAY DON'T

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:19.750
HAVE CARS AND YET A LARGE PART

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.119
OF THE INCREASE IN DEMAND IT'S

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:24.287
GOING TO BE ELECTRIC CARS

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:25.756
ELECTRIFICATION FOR RUSSIA.

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:27.457
HOMES IT'S CETERA BUT

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.793
PARTICULARLY FOR CARS AND FOR

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.194
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CARS OR

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:32.963
WHO USED TO FUEL OTHER THAN LUCK

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:37.734
TRICITY. ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.803
TO TAKE ON. AND THE IS WHY I

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.438
ALWAYS HAVE IF KNEW. HOW MUCH

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.273
WAS INCREASED USAGE VERSUS.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.709
DIFFERENT TERM TRANSMISSION BUT

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:47.144
THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE HERE FOR

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.012
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CARDS OR

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.580
HAVE DEEP FEW CARDS FOR THE OLD

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:53.316
ON HYDROGEN OR BIO FUELS AND ARE

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.485
THEY GONNA HAVE TO ALSO PAY FOR

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.354
THIS INCREASE TRANSMISSION. IT'S

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:59.389
CLEARLY WE DON'T EVEN HAVE AN

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.324
ANSWER RIGHT NOW FOR HOW MUCH

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:04.094
THIS IS COSTING BUT I THINK IT'S

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:06.496
SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.497
THE FUTURE TO BE FAIR- SO MISTER

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:10.634
BAKER WHAT DO YOU THINK. SO I

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.401
THINK I WOULD ADDRESS THAT

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:13.570
QUESTION IN A COUPLE OF WAYS BUT

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:16.139
HISTORICALLY THE YOU KNOW ONE OF

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:16.973
THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.708
ELECTRICITY SYSTEM IS AS WE

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:21.044
INVESTED MORE IN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.180
IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES. WE

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:24.915
WERE ALSO INCREASING USAGE SO

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:26.883
THOSE ELECTRONS WERE SPREAD OUT

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:30.220
OVER MORE AND MORE USERS YOU'RE

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:31.855
ACTUALLY ABLE TO SEE A

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.723
DECLINING- COST OVER THE OVER

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:36.059
THAT TIME FRAME. AND I THINK

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.594
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DO

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:38.495
ELECTRIFICATION PARTICULARLY OF

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.530
TRANSFER OF PARTICULAR EVIL OF

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.999
CONSUMER VEHICLES- YOU MAY BE

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:45.602
ABLE TO SEE THAT AS WELL AND I

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.137
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:49.039
THAT WE WILL REALLY WANT. TO IS

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.307
YOU KNOW MAKE SURE COST BECAUSE

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:51.908
THERE'S ARE THE ONES WHO WILL

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.510
ABSORB THE COST OF IT- BUT ALSO

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:55.712
TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.147
ELECTRIFICATION IS DONE IN A WAY

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:59.282
SO THAT IT. MINIMIZES THE AMOUNT

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:00.350
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:02.986
BE BORN AND I THINK WE'LL WE'RE

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.288
MINDFUL OF. THE CONCERNS YOU'RE

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.457
RAISING AROUND. OU KNOW THE

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.059
TYPES OF VEHICLES THAT PEOPLE

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:10.894
DRIVE AND I THINK WE WERE MORE

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.996
THAN WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:15.732
OKAY. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE-

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.033
INCREASE. IN TRANSMISSION AND

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.769
PROJECTS. I THINK A LARGE PART

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:21.338
OF THAT TEHACHAPI OVERRUN THIS

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:23.507
DUE TO THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF

00:52:23.573 --> 00:52:25.509
LOCAL OPPOSITION THEY- THEY

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:27.410
WENT. WENT UNDERGROUND WITH THE

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:30.647
WIRES WHICH WILL BE DOING OF

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:33.316
COURSE A LOT MORE OF- I DON'T

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:34.184
KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER PROJECTS

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:36.152
BUT THIS ONE. I WOULD THINK THAT

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.954
A LARGE FRACTION THAT OVERRIDE

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:39.723
WAS DUE TO THE UNDERGROUNDING

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:43.293
ZACHAREK CORRECT. AND HI FOR

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.395
DOING A LOT MORE THAT'S ANOTHER

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:49.399
ISSUE. THE AND IF I COULD JUST

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:51.067
THAT ARE NOT THAT HAVING TO TAKE

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:52.502
THESE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:53.837
AROUND THE THUS THE ROUTING OF

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.805
THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF AND

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.073
WHERE THAT MIGHT LEAD IS

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.441
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:00.143
TO PUT MORE ATTENTION TO IN OUR

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.478
OWN PLANNING PROCESSES AND A

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:02.913
TRANSMISSION LINE WITH THAT WENT

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.348
INTO SERVICE A FEW YEARS AGO IN

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.316
SAN DIEGO WHEN WE ARE CONDUCTING

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:07.551
OUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING SO

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:10.086
THAT THERE WERE NO SURPRISES WE

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:11.288
COSTA DEL BOTH THE COST OF

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.822
OVERHEAD AS WELL AS UNDERGROUND

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.291
AND IT SPECIFIED ARE LEVEL ONE

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.493
OR THE OTHER. BUT WE DID PROTECT

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.627
THE PRICE INTO ACCOUNT RIGHT

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:20.196
FROM THE START WITH THE HATCH P.

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:21.197
ADMITTEDLY WE DID NOT SEE THAT

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.233
COMING BUT ANOTHER PROJECTS

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.301
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR OTHER

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:25.402
OPPORTUNITIES AND THERE ARE

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:27.070
TIMES WERE GOING UNDERGROUND CAN

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:28.939
ACTUALLY SAVE US SOME MONEY BY

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:31.308
REDUCING THE CITING COSTS AND

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.410
LAND ACCESS COSTS BEYOND YOUR

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:35.445
ALSO AS YOU YOU'RE ALSO MORE

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:37.280
LIKELY TO FINISH PROJECT ON TIME

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:40.483
IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:45.088
THE WIRES. WHY IS SAN DIEGO.

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:49.392
SUCH A- DIRT THEY'RE PAYING A

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.694
LOT MORE FOR TRANSMISSION THAN

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.263
THE OTHER SAN DIEGO- ELECTRIC

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.031
GAS ELECTRIC IS PAYING A LOT

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:57.100
MORE FOR TRANSMISSION I CAN SORT

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:59.736
OF UNDERSTAND PG&amp;E WITH VERY

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:03.540
SPREAD OUT- BASS AND I CAN

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:05.809
UNDERSTAND ADDISON BEING IN A

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:08.645
MUCH MORE COMPACT- BUT WHY IS

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:11.181
SAN DIEGO SO HIGH YOU WOULD

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:14.150
THINK THAT THERE. WELL I JUST.

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:20.256
CURIOUS. THE RESULT IN YOUR

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:23.093
GRAPH IMPAIRING THE THREE- I'LL

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:30.867
USE CLUSTER TRANSMISSION. OKAY

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.770
CLOSER TO THE COMMISSION

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:37.273
TRANSMISSION CAN WITH CENTER

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:44.547
ANDRE. I IT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.116
IS READING I WAS JUST GOING TO

00:54:46.182 --> 00:54:47.150
SAY- I'M ASSUMING THAT THE SUIT

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:49.052
AND THAT THIS IS JUST ONE THING

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.387
AT THE CHEQUERED THESE HIGH

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.322
VOLTAGE OR TOTAL TRANSMISSION

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.790
COSTS. HIGH VOLTAGE. AS A

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:59.863
PERCENTAGE OF RATES. OKAY SO IF

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:02.032
I'M SORRY IF THIS IS THE HIGH

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:06.503
VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION CHARGE- AS

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.304
A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR RATE IT

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.040
COULD JUST ALSO BE A FUNCTION OF

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:11.408
THE REST OF THEIR RATE BECAUSE

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:12.876
SOME TYPE THE HUBBLE BUT I

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.477
SHOULD ALSO CLARIFY OUR HIGH

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:16.279
VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION CHARGES ARE

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:17.947
COVERED ON A DOLLARS PER

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:20.016
MEGAWATT HOUR. FROM THE

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:22.052
UTILITIES OR THE LOAD SERVING

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:23.520
ENTITIES THAT ARE SERVING THE

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:25.922
LOAD BUT THE WIRES RATES

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:27.624
THEMSELVES REFLECTED DECISIONAL

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.459
RATE DESIGN SO NOT EVERYONE HAS

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:32.662
THE SAME RATE DESIGN FOR HOW

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:33.663
TRANSMISSION COSTS THAT ARE

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.699
BEING LEVELIZED THROUGH OUR

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.834
PROCESS ARE BEING RECOVERED FROM

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.336
RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS SO THEY

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:41.504
CAN APPLY DIFFERENT RATE

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.773
STRUCTURES AS WELL IN THEIR

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.275
FINAL RATE DESIGN THAT WE DON'T

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.544
HAVE DISABILITY YEAH SAN DIEGO

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.013
OVER ALTHOUGH HAS HIGHER RATES

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.983
PERIOD. FOR THEIR CONSUMERS. CAN

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.454
I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD WHY

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.988
. I MEAN I WILL DEFINITELY GET

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:01.357
BACK TO YOU ON THAT SOME OF THE

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:02.058
INITIAL THINGS THEY HAVE A VERY

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:04.127
HIGH PENETRATION OF ROOFTOP

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:06.463
SOLAR IN THEIR- VERY SPRING TO

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.364
COST UP QUITE A BIT THEY ALSO

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:12.602
HAVE THEIR MORE OF A- YOU KNOW A

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:14.604
WIRES COMPANY THEN. ON THE OTHER

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:16.172
THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES BUT

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:18.808
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:19.809
EXACT ANSWER ON OKAY THANK YOU.

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:21.911
THANK YOU AND THE QUESTIONS-

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:23.580
QUESTION SIR. THERE WERE TWO

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.248
QUESTIONS WHY ON THE EFFICIENCY

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:27.484
SIDE. OF BOTH FR MR RIGHT

WHEN YOUR LAST SLIDE THAT THE

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.756
ISO'S REVIEWING YOUR GENERATION

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:34.824
INTERCONNECTION PROCESSES. WAS

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.359
THAT INVOLVED IN TO SPEAK FUTURE

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:37.994
INTERCONNECTION CLUSTERS HAVING

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:40.363
SIMILAR VOLUME. ISSUES YOU SEEN

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:42.332
WITH CLUSTER FOURTEEN. YOU HAVE

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:46.069
ANY POTENTIAL REMEDIES FOR THIS

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:47.971
IF THAT'S WHAT THINGS ARE ADDED

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:50.206
. RIGHT NOW ALL THE INDICATIONS

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:52.408
WE'RE GETTING FROM. AND I THAT

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:54.410
MAINLY FROM OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:55.411
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TEND TO

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:56.846
DEVELOP THESE APPLICATIONS ON

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:59.883
BEHALF OF THE VARIOUS INVESTORS

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.918
IS THAT WE COULD SEE AS MANY OR

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.520
EVEN MORE APPLICATIONS COMING

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.421
OUT US AND THE NEXT CYCLE AND

00:57:05.488 --> 00:57:06.689
THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:08.558
THINK WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:09.859
THAT IN SOME AREAS WE ARE

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.594
LOOKING AT INCREASING THE

00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:13.096
APPLICATION FEES AS WELL AS

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:15.398
INTRODUCING OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:16.633
TOO SO THAT THE PROJECTS THAT

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:18.701
ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD CAN

00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:19.869
MOVE FORWARD ON A MORE TIMELY

00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:22.038
BASIS AND THAT THE PROJECTS THAT

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:23.673
ARE NOT READY TO MOVE FORWARD TO

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.175
SOME EXTENT STEP ASIDE AND MAKE

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:27.410
WAY FOR THE ONES THAT ARE SO WE

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:28.945
ARE LOOKING AT WE'VE ALREADY

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.113
ASKED OUR BOARD TO APPROVE

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:35.718
CERTAIN CHANGES TOWARD TARIFFS

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:36.386
ALREADY IN THAT REGARD. AND WILL

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:38.321
BE BRINGING THE- YOU READY. DO

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:39.923
THIS YEAR CELS THAT WE'RE

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.758
WORKING ON AS WELL. SO PART OF

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.793
THAT IS TO MANAGED- AND FOCUS

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.161
THE ATTENTION ON THE ONES THAT

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.330
ARE READY TO MOVE SO THAT WE'RE

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.398
NOT DISTRACTED BY THE LARGE

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:50.333
VOLUMES THAT ARE NOT OKAY I

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.068
THINK IN ADDITION TO THAT I

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:53.837
THINK JUST HAVING. A RESOURCE

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:56.105
DEVELOPMENT PLAY OUT SO THAT THE

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.073
PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.441
GETTING CONTRACTED ARE MOVING

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.510
FORWARD AND REALLY AND IT AND

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:02.679
THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:03.413
GET CLEARED OUT OF THAT A

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.815
PROCESS SO KIND OF THIS BACKLOG

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:07.717
OF HAVING A LOT OF. DEMAND BUT

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:11.120
NOT A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IS-

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:13.556
EXACERBATING THE ISSUE. OKAY NO

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.191
QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU IS

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:17.961
THAT. IN YOUR PRESENTATIONS USE

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:20.096
INPUTS FROM THE CPUC TO DO YOUR

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:22.799
TRANSMISSION PLANNING- BUT THEN

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.901
YOU MUST DEFEND THOSE SAME DATA

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.903
POINTS- WHEN YOU'RE BEFORE THE

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.306
CPUC. AND DONNA WERE WONDERING I

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:32.041
MEAN IS THERE A DIFFERENT WAY OF

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:34.911
GOING ABOUT- GETTING TO A PLACE

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.680
WHERE WE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:38.281
EFFECTIVE WITH OUR TIME- TO

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:41.050
ULTIMATELY GET TO THE END GOAL

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:42.185
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:45.421
WEB AND ASKED THE SAME QUESTION

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.457
FOR DIRECTOR MAKERS WELL. AT THE

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:48.491
CELLS WHAT ONE IS. YOU DAD HAD

00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:50.360
AN ISSUE THAT SHOWS UP AND I

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.195
HAVE TO ADMIT I'VE TESTIFIED IN

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.330
ALMOST EVERY. MAJOR TRANSMISSION

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:55.932
FILING IN THE LAST TEN YEARS

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.600
IT'S GOING TO HEARING. AND THAT

00:58:57.667 --> 00:58:59.302
THAT THE ISSUE IS YOU KNOW IT'S

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.037
FOR ITS IN FRONT OF US THAT WERE

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:02.972
RELYING ON INPUTS FROM THE

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:03.907
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:06.009
ITSELF. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:08.411
AREAS WE WOULD FOR TO SEE. MORE

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:10.513
MORE SCRUTINY. AT THE PROJECT

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.849
INITIATION STAGE. INSTEAD OF

00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:14.250
GOING THROUGH ALL OF THE

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.252
DETAILED ROUTING ENGINEERING

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:18.221
WORK AND REVISITING THE QUESTION

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:20.056
OF IF THE LINE WAS NEEDED IN THE

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:22.125
FIRST PLACE. SO GETTING MORE

00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:23.860
SCRUTINY OUT FRONT BUT BACKING

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.895
OFF ON THIS AFTER THE FACT.

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:28.531
DUPLICATION WOOD WE THINK IT'S

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:29.899
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.834
NOW HOT WHAT SHAPE THAT TAKES

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.169
THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.237
MODELS OUT THERE BUT AS A

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:35.271
FUNDAMENTAL GOAL THAT'S

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:36.639
SOMETHING WE WOULD REALLY SEE

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:39.142
SOME. OPPORTUNITY FOR. THANK YOU

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:41.244

WE DO PARTICIPATE IN BOTH THE

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:46.215
CDC PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE-

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:48.584
THE- THE FORECAST AND WE

00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:51.521
PROVIDE. SOME INPUT ON THAT AND-

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:54.891
COLLABORATE- BUT ALSO IN THE CQC

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.392
PROCESS OF THE RESOURCE PLANNING

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.994
WE DO HAVE OPPORTUNITY AND WE DO

00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:00.229
COMMENT. IN THE RESOURCE PLAN

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:01.531
BEFORE IT IS FINALIZED AND

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:03.800
APPROVED AND THUS KICKING OFF

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:05.468
THE INPUT TO THE TRANSMISSION

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:07.103
PLANNING PROCESS SO WE DO

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.906
EXERCISE THOSE ANA. THOSE

WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:20.583
NUMBER OF TIMES THAT- YOU KNOW.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.352
THE PROPERTY FOR BY TO THE APPLE

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.287
I WOULD SAY OUR- WE ARE NOW

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:27.190
STUDYING. HOW WE CAN MORE

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:30.460
EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE UP FRONT. IN

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:33.329
THE PLANNING PROCESS- AND WAYS

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.098
TO GET SOME OF THE COST

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:35.665
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE CARE

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.166
ABOUT ADDRESSED UP FRONT DOOR

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:39.669
LOOKED OUT UP FRONT- AS OPPOSED

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.938
TO. DOING SOME OF THAT FROM

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.840
CANDOR FROM THE END PART OF THE

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.942
STRATEGY BUT WE DO SEE THAT THAT

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:48.177
IS THE- ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.045
LOOK AT. RIGHT THANK YOU EVER

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:51.214
HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF GO

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.749
AROUND ONCE MORE IF NOT THANK

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.050
YOU- YOU'RE NOT GOING VERY FAR

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.519
SHE US SO WE MAY COME UP WITH

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:57.186
SOME. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WILL

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.622
GO ON WITH THE- AGENDA WE HAVE

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:01.657
SINCE JENNY MEN AND WITH VICE

CALIFORNIA EDISON. I THANK YOU

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.373
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.542
WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT ONE OF THE

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:20.576
MOST IMPORTANT TRANSITIONS AHEAD

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:23.046
OF US. YOU KNOW THE BABY LOOK AT

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:24.981
THAT THE VALUE OF THE ELECTRIC

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.749
GRID GOES BEYOND THE COMMODITY

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:28.918
COST OF THE ENERGY DELIVERS. THE

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:30.453
GREAT POWERS ALL ASPECTS OF OUR

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.822
SOCIETY AS ELECTRICITY BECOMES

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.490
THE FUELING SYSTEM FOR A LARGER

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.259
PART OF THE ECONOMY WE MUST RE

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:37.927
IMAGINED WHAT THE FUTURE GREAT

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.129
SHOULD LOOK LIKE AT ALL LEVELS.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.397
AND HOW IT MUST FUNCTION

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:42.765
DIFFERENTLY TO MEET THOSE

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.667
EXPANDED NEEDS. IN RECENT

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:45.868
HISTORY LOAD GROWTH AN

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.336
ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.305
OUTS HAVE PROCEEDED AT A MODEST

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.740
PACE. WITH THE REASONABLE

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:52.675
PREDICTABILITY. WHILE AN

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.710
ELECTRIC SYSTEM UPGRADE CAN TAKE

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:57.380
AS LONG AS A DECADE DECIDE

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:59.582
LICENSE BUILD AND COMMISSION THE

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:01.117
EXTREMELY LONG LEAD TIMES FOR

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:02.919
MANAGEABLE GIVEN THE SMARTEST

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.954
PREDICTABLE GROWTH. HOWEVER WE

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:06.255
ARE CURRENTLY AT AN INFLECTION

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.890
POINT VERY RAPID ACCELERATION IN

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:10.460
ELECTRIC GRID UPGRADES AS NEEDED

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:11.994
COMPARED TO WHAT WAS SUFFICIENT

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.564
HISTORICALLY. SO IT'S ESSENTIAL

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.065
TO PREPARE SO THAT WE CAN

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.101
INCREASE DECARBONISATION

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.802
ACCELERATED ELECTRIFICATION

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:23.306
IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND RESPOND

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:24.407
TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. I'D

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.609
LIKE TO FOCUS FOR A MINUTE ON

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.578
THE DECARBONISATION ASPECT.

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.979
DECARBONISATION OF OUR ECONOMY

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.914
WILL BE A POOR DRIVER OF HOW THE

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.016
PLAN DESIGN AND OPERATE THE

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.018
ELECTRIC PARADE GOING FORWARD.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.487
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:38.855
UPDATING THE STATE'S COPING

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.023
SPLAT BAND AS WE SPEAK THAT

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.892
CRAFTING THE STATE'S BLACK TO

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.495
CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.730
FORTY FIVE AND THE IMPLICATIONS

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:48.798
FOR THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM ARE

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.433
MONUMENTAL. FOR THE ALTERNATIVE

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.068
THAT CARPET HIGHLIGHTED AS THE

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:53.836
PREFERRD SCENARIO ALTERNATIVE

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:56.339
THREE. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.241
ELECTRIC LOAD WOULD INCREASE BY

01:02:58.307 --> 01:02:59.242
NEARLY TWO THIRDS FROM TWENTY

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:02.311
TWENTY LEVELS. WE WILL NEED TO

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.546
BUILD OUT SEVEN GIGAWATTS OF

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.315
SOLAR AND DO BIGGER WALKS OF

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.016
BATTERY STORAGE EVERY SINGLE

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:09.719
YEAR. FOR CONTEXT HISTORICALLY

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:12.989
WE HAVE ONLY BUILT OUT LESS THAN

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.123
THREE GIGAWATTS OF SOLAR AT THE

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.125
MAXIMUM. AND WE NEED TO CONNECT

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:18.261
ALL OF THAT TO THE GREAT TO MEET

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:19.695
INCREASED DEMAND FROM

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:22.431
ELECTRIFICATION. BY 2035100% OF

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:24.867
THE ANNUAL LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.102
SOLD IN THE STATE WILL BE ZERO

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.171
EMISSION. WE ALSO EXPECT MAJOR

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:29.739
CHANGES IN HOW CUSTOMERS WILL

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.674
USE ELECTRICITY WHICH WILL PLACE

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:34.777
UNPRECEDENTED STRESS ON THE GRID

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.312
. DEMAND WILL BE HIGHER AND LESS

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:38.447
PREDICTABLE SUPPLY WILL BE MORE

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.383
INTERMITTENT AND DEPENDENCE ON

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:43.452
ELECTRICITY FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:44.453
HOMES AND BUSINESSES WILL

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.590
INCREASE. CONVERSATIONS WITH CC

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.193
THE CPUC ADVERTISER REVEALED A

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:51.394
GROWING APPRECIATION OF THE

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.162
CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US AND THE

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:55.698
NEED FOR ACTION NOW. I DO WANT

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.033
TO EMPHASIZE THAT TO HIT THE

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.702
SHARED GOALS WE WILL NEED TO DO

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:02.038
MORE THAN TRANSMISSION UPGRADES.

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.906
MEETING INCREASED LOCAL DEMAND

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.808
AND INTERCONNECTING DISTRIBUTED

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.910
ENERGY RESOURCES WILL ALSO

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.513
REQUIRE UPGRADES AND NEW DESIGN

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.380
AND OPERATING STANDARDS AT THE

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:13.482
BILL XIN LEVELS AND AT CUSTOMER

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:16.118
SITES. AS THE GREAT GETS MORE

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:18.087
COMPLEX AND INTERCONNECTED

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.655
TECHNOLOGY WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.557
FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT AS WELL

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:23.526
WHETHER IT IS FOR COMMUNICATION

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:26.295
AUTOMATION MORE SENSORS ON THE

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:28.164
GRADE OR CYBER SECURITY. TO

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.333
OPERATE A SAFE SECURE RELIABLE

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:32.735
AND FLEXIBLE GRADE YOU MUST ALSO

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:35.037
INVEST IN THE DIGITAL

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:37.073
INFRASTRUCTURE. LET ME QUICKLY

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.976
GO THROUGH A TOUR OF SOME OF THE

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.244
CHALLENGES BEFORE US A LOT OF

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.312
YOU THIS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.648
ABOUT. WHAT SPECIFICALLY MORE

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.216
THAN TWENTY MILLION LIGHT DUTY

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.318
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE EXPECTED

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.220
BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:52.288
CALIFORNIA. WITH EACH NEW

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:54.323
VEHICLE SPEAK CHARGING BEING

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.260
ROUGHLY THE EQUIVALENT OF ADDING

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:59.295
A NEW HOME TO THE CORRECT. FOR

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.129
THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.231
ELECTRIC GRID WAS BUILT A

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.200
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DIMOND

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.035
WILL COME FROM DEVICES THAT ARE

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:08.204
NOT STATIONARY MAKING LOAD

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:09.672
FORECASTING BY LOCATION MORE

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:13.409
DIFFICULT. NOT ONLY WILL THE

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:13.876
UNCERTAINTY OF DEMAND

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.111
FORECASTING INCREASE THE

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:17.380
VARIABILITY IN POWER SUPPLY WITH

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.015
RENEWABLE RESOURCES BUT ALSO

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.317
INCREASE AS MANY OF THESE ARE

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:23.552
INTERMITTENT RESOURCES. THIS IN

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:24.887
TURN WILL CHALLENGE THE GRID

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.455
STABILITY RELIABILITY AND

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.758
RESILIENCE. CONNECTING MILLIONS

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:30.826
OF SOLAR PANELS BATTERIES AND

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.762
ELECTRONICS TO THE GREAT COULD

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.497
CAUSE WIDESPREAD POWER QUALITY

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.265
IMPACTS SUCH AS VOLTAGE

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.334
DISTORTIONS. WHICH IF LEFT

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.935
UNMITIGATED WOULD SHORTEN THE

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:41.971
LIFE OF CUSTOMER AND GREAT

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:44.707
EQUIPMENT LIKE. THE BUSCA FUTURE

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.142
RENEWABLE RESOURCES WILL BE

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:48.044
LOCATED FAR FROM CUSTOMERS AND

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.245
THE CURRENT TRANSMISSION GRID

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.514
WOULD BE UNABLE TO DELIVER

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.381
ADEQUATE POWER TO OVERLOOKED

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.150
CENTERS. THE GRID WOULD BE

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.551
EXPOSED TO GROWING CLIMATE

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.987
CHANGE EFFECTS RECENT WILDFIRES

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.789
AND HEATWAVES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:02.224
ONLY PROOF OF THE ACCELERATION

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.327
OF THESE CLIMATE CHALLENGES. WE

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.262
CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:07.196
CHALLENGES BUT WHAT ARE THE

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:09.498
SOLUTIONS. IN SHORT READ

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:11.167
PLANNING DESIGN AND OPERATIONS

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:13.569
NEED TO INVOLVE STARTING RIGHT

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.671
NOW. THOUGH THERE ARE CONTINUED

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.073
UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.342
TRAJECTORIES OF DEMAND GROWTH

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.142
AND RENEWABLE RESOURCE

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:22.778
DEVELOPMENT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:25.147
THE END GAME. THAT IS WE MAY NOT

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.116
KNOW THE EXACT PATH BUT WE ALL

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.151
KNOW A DESTINATION. CALIFORNIA

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:32.088
SHOULD MAKE REASONABLE REFORMS

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.622
TO THE EXISTING PLANNING REGINA

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:35.758
AND PERMITTING PROCESSES WE NEED

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.927
LONGER TERM PLANNING AND WE NEED

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.295
TO GET AHEAD OF THE DEMAND

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.197
GROWTH CURVE BY BEGINNING THE

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.665
NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN THE

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.202
SYSTEMS NOW. WE SHOULD HAVE

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.104
ELECTRIC UTILITIES PROACTIVELY

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.272
UPGRADE THE GREAT BY PROVIDING

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:51.674
THEM ADEQUATE COST RECOVERY

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.976
ASSURANCES. GETTING AHEAD OF

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.911
CLEAN TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:58.080
WORSENING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:00.549
WILL ALLOW AVOID COSTLY JUST IN

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.485
TIME SOLUTIONS PREVENT THE GREAT

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.253
FROM BEING A BARRIER TO

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:04.687
ELECTRIFICATION AND

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.822
DECARBONISATION. AND IN FACT

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.791
ENABLE AN EQUITABLE AND

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.627
AFFORDABLE TRANSITION TO A CLEAN

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.362
ECONOMY. WE SHOULD ALSO EXPAND

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:14.964
ENERGY SYSTEM PLANNING ACROSS

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.333
STATE AGENCIES TO LONGER TERM

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.603
TIME HORIZONS AND TWENTY FORTY

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:22.071
FIVE DECARBONISATION OBJECTIVES.

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:24.240
WE NEED TO WORK ON THE NEAR TERM

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:27.042
NEEDS AND LONG TERM TARGETS WITH

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:29.278
EQUAL URGENCY. SIGNIFICANT

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:30.980
AMOUNT OF TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.915
BE BUILT TO SUPPORT SB ONE

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:34.450
HUNDRED AND CARBON NEUTRALITY

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.218
ALL PARTIES AGREE ON THIS POINT

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.320
TWO. SO SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:41.223
TRANSMISSION. TWO THINGS FIRST

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.125
WE NEED TO PLAN USING DIMOND AND

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:44.927
RESOURCE FORECASTS THAT COULD

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:46.896
ACTUALLY MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:49.031
ENERGY GOALS OR AT LEAST HAVE A

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:50.099
REASONABLE CHANCE TO MEET THOSE

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.601
GOALS OTHERWISE WE FALL FURTHER

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:54.336
AND FURTHER BEHIND. WE SHOULD

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.938
ENSURE THAT KIND SO TRANSMISSION

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:58.741
PLANNING PROCESS OR D. B. B.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.109
INCORPORATES TWENTY FORTY FIVE

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:02.011
GOALS THE TEN YEAR PLANNING

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.312
HORIZON OFF CRISIS B. B. B. DOES

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:05.648
NOT CURRENTLY INTEGRATE THE POTS

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.550
HIGHLIGHTED BY CARP SCOPING PLAN

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:10.653
SCENARIOS. TO HELP HIGH SO THE

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.288
STATE SHOULD REQUIRED THAT THE

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:14.924
CC PROVIDE FULL FIFTEEN YEAR I

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.359
PER FORECAST TO THE CHI SO FOR

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.428
USE IN ITS STEEL B. B. AND I PER

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:21.063
FORGOT SHOULD REFLECT A BIBLE

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.832
TRAJECTORY TO CARBON NEUTRALITY

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.867
BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THAT

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.369
INCORPORATE STATE POLICIES LAWS

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:31.006
REGULATIONS. AND EXECUTIVE

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.408
ORDERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE I PER

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.276
FORECAST TO THE HI SO FOUR

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.945
TRANSMISSION PLANNING SHOULD

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.680
REFLECT THE STATE POLICIES FOR

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.682
ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION. IN

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:42.518
OUR VIEW THIS WILL HELP. ENSURE

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.620
TIMELY MODELING AND APPROVAL OFF

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:47.289
A LONG LEAD TIME TRANSMISSION

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.425
OPERATES BY THE CRISIS. SECOND

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.126
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A UNIFIED

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.661
STATE AND LOCAL CITING AND

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:55.297
APPROVAL PROCESS. ONE KEY

01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:56.532
CHALLENGE WITH TRANSMISSION

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:57.766
DEVELOPMENT IS THAT PLANNING

01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.735
BETWEEN RELEVANT ENTITIES IS NOT

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:02.104
ALIGNED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:03.572
VARIOUS AGENCIES ARE NOT

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.341
EQUIPPED WITH PLANTS THAT COULD

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:07.343
BE CHEAP THE STATE'S GOALS. AS

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:09.211
THE SB ONE HUNDRED JOINT AGENCY

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.747
REPORT NOTED A UNIFIED PLANNING

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:12.982
PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING YOU

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.550
DIDN'T INCLUDE THE SCALE ENERGY

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.952
PROJECTS AND RESPECTIVE

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:18.654
TRANSMISSION LINES MUST BE

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.656
CONSIDERED. IT WILL ALSO BE

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:21.824
IMPERATIVE TO FASTRACK HIGH

01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:23.726
PRIORITY PROJECTS BELLOWED IS

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.427
BOUND TO INCREASE WITH THE

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:26.896
SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY CONSTRAINED

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.497
ARE CLOSE TO BEING CONSTRAINED

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.266
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.968
VITAL FOR EXAMPLE LOCATIONS IN

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.970
COMMUNITIES NEAR THE PORTS MAJOR

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:38.040
TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS AND

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:42.044
WAREHOUSE DISTRICTS. IN OUR VIEW

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.546
THE STATE DOES NOT NEED NEW

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.781
AGENCIES OR NEW PUBLIC FINANCING

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.983
MECHANISMS IT NEEDS COMMONSENSE

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.652
REFORMS OF THE EXISTING

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.754
PROCESSES TO ENABLE PROACTIVE

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.756
GREAT INVESTMENT INVESTMENTS AND

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:56.659
MINIMIZE THE TIME TO CONSTRUCT

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:57.226
TRANSMISSION LINES. WE ARE

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:58.827
ACTIVELY WORKING ON SOLUTIONS

TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY FOR

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.782
ALL CALIFORNIANS WE NEED TO CUT

CURRENT TIME LINES DOWN AND FIND

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:24.620
WAYS TO UNDERSTAND TODAY WHAT

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.851
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.320
THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. MY NAME IS

CAMERON KASKY I WORK FOR EDP

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:02.658
RENEWABLES WERE UP- GLOBAL

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:05.361
NATIONAL MULTI TECHNOLOGY

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.696
RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPER. AND

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:10.265
ALSO ASSET OWNER- WE DO WIND

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:12.167
SOLAR STORAGE OFFSHORE WIND

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.737
HYDROGEN WE HAVE- MOSTLY UTILITY

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.305
SCALE BUT ALSO DISTRIBUTED

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:19.541
GENERATION. BUSINESS I AGREE

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.610
WITH A LOT OF COMMENTS OF THEIR

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:24.780
PANELISTS SO FAR TODAY I WANT

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:27.316
TO- PRIMARILY ADD TO THE SENSE

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.951
OF URGENCY AROUND THE

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:31.453
TRANSMISSION QUESTION. IN MY

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.523
VIEW I THINK IT'S THE SINGLE

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.358
LARGEST BARRIER TO REACHING OUT

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.427
MERE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS I PREACH

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.496
APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION FROM

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:43.365
THE COMMITTEE. ON THIS ISSUE I

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.833
WILL SAY THAT THIS PROBLEM IS

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.536
NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA- BY ANY

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:49.638
MEANS IT'S ONE OF THE LARGER

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:52.374
CONCERNS- AND ALL THE STATES

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.176
THAT WE WORK AND TRANSMISSION IS

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:56.979
FUNDAMENTALLY A- A DIFFICULT

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.815
ISSUE TO DEAL WITH- A TOUCH ON

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.216
SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:02.851
AT ALL I'LL GET I BROUGHT JUST A

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.120
COUPLE SLIDES- THERE ARE

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:06.889
REFERRED TO IN A LITTLE BIT-

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:09.191
THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. BUT

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:10.225
SO I TOUCH ON SOME OF THE

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.894
REASONS WHY I THINK TRANSMISSION

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.962
IS SO DIFFICULT IN SOME AREAS

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.065
FOR IMPROVEMENT. ONE IS THAT

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.966
THERE'S SO MANY ENTITIES

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.234
INVOLVED IN THEY'RE ALL

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:21.303
DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER RIGHT

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:23.305
TRANSMISSION OWNERS. AND

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:25.474
OPERATORS THEY REALLY NEED TO BE

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.443
TOLD- BY THE GENERATORS AND THE

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.811
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES WHERE

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.112
THEY'RE GOING TO CONTRACT FOR

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.381
NEW RESOURCES SO THEY KNOW WHERE

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:34.049
TO PLAN AND BUILD THE NEW

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:35.784
TRANSMISSION TO. THE SAME TIME

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.287
ON OUR HANDS- YOU KNOW WE NEED

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:39.555
TO BE CONFIDENT THAT THE

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.523
TRANSMISSION WILL BE THERE ONCE

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.992
OUR GENERATION IS BUILT- SO THAT

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.594
WE CAN DELIVER OUR RESOURCE

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:50.099
ADEQUACY. IN OUR CLEAN ENERGY ON

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:51.366
TIME- AND THEN THE STATE SIDE

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:52.968
YOU KNOW WE ALL NEED THE

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:54.269
REGULATORS. BLESS THOSE

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.038
INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCE SOMETIMES

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:57.272
AND ALSO YOU KNOW DO THE

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:59.508
PERMANENT WORK- TO MAKE THE

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.910
TRANSMISSION HAPPEN. SO THIS IS

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:04.446
AN AREA WHERE CONVENE ALL THE

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.914
ENTITIES WHERE SOME STATE

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.916
LEADERSHIP I THINK CAN REALLY BE

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:10.753
CRITICAL- TO HELP DRIVE THE

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:11.720
INDUSTRY FORWARD IN CUTS

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:15.190
THROUGH- SOME OF THOSE CHICKEN

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:16.625
AND EGG ISSUES. ABOUT THE OTHER

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.727
ISSUE A TRANSMISSION IS IT IT'S

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.496
BEEN TOUCHED ON ALREADY TODAY

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.432
BUT IT JUST TAKES SO LONG RIGHT

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:24.666
IT'S BY FAR THE LONGEST LEAD

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:28.337
TIME- ASSETS INVOLVED IN OUR

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:30.139
ENERGY TRANSITION WE CAN BUILD.

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:32.074
OUR CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.576
ARMATURE ONCE ANYWAYS IN ABOUT

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:36.345
EIGHTEEN MONTHS- BUT IT TAKES

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.614
YOU KNOW SEVEN TO TEN YEARS TO

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.916
BUILD NEW TRANSMISSION- EVEN

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:45.354
FOR. CERTAIN JUST UPGRADES WHICH

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.555
SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:48.490
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:49.992
YOU'RE RE CONDUCT DURING.

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:52.027
TRANSMISSION TOWERS IN EXISTING

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.462
RIGHT AWAY IT'S NEW SEEN

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:55.531
SIGNIFICANT DELAYS FOR THAT

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.366
WORK. SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:58.834
WHY THE CRISIS TWENTY YEAR

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.536
OUTLOOK- IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:03.071
STEP FORWARD IN THAT REGARD.

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:05.107
LAYS OUT THE FUTURE PICTURE OF

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:06.909
WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO GO WITH

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.944
TRANSMISSION NOW WE NEED TO TAKE

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:12.447
THAT INFORMATION AND- INCLUDE IT

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:13.949
. IN OUR RESOURCE PLANNING

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:16.752
PROCESS SEES IN THE STATE AND

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:17.920
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:20.889
THOSE INVESTMENTS- SOON SO IT'LL

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:23.692
BE READY WHEN WE'RE BUILDING

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.794
THOSE RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.362
THE OTHER ISSUE WITH

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.097
TRANSMISSION THAT WILL BE NO

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:31.266
SURPRISE TO FOLKS IS THE

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:34.303
PERMITTING CHALLENGES- THAT IS

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:35.938
JUST DIFFICULT CITING LINEAR

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:38.273
FACILITIES- IS DIFFICULT NO

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.975
MATTER WHAT THEY ARE. I DON'T

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.210
THINK THERE'S ANY EASY WAY

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:43.312
AROUND THAT BUT- I DO THINK THAT

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:44.947
THERE'S SOME PRINCIPLES THAT CAN

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.015
BE HELPFUL WITHOUT ISSUE ONE IS

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:49.451
STARTING EARLY. AND WE HAVE THE

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:51.320
TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK NOW- IT

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:52.421
PAINTS A PRETTY CLEAR PICTURE

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.356
FROM WHERE E WILL NEED SOME

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:55.524
UPGRADES I THINK STARTING THE

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.459
PERMITTING PROCESS ON SOME OF

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:59.494
THOSE LINES SOONER. RATHER THAN

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:00.629
LATER AND HAVING THE PERMITS

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:04.533
READY TO BE A PRUDENT STEP- THE

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.002
OTHER POINT HERE IS TO USE ON

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.838
CITING IS TO USE. OUR CORRIDORS

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:12.040
AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. AND

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:13.942
IF- THE STAFF TO GO TO THE WATER

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:27.456
SLIDE. WHEN I BROUGHT- THIS. I

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:33.128
MEAN A- THANK YOU. THIS IS A

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.897
REALLY GREAT PICTURE I WANT TO

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:36.498
SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:37.933
ILLUSTRATES SOME OF BOTH THE

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.769
LAND AND COST THE COLONIES OF

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:42.971
SCALE BUILDING BIGGER

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.373
TRANSMISSION PRESIDENT

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.508
INCREMENTALLY GOING IN AND

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:49.177
BUILDING- SMALLER TRANSMISSION

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:52.080
ON A AS NEEDED BASIS IF YOU LOOK

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:55.450
AT THE- SEVEN SIXTY FIVE KV

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:59.187
TRANSMISSION CORRIDOR- EXAMPLE

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:02.491
VERSES OF THREE FORTY FIVE KV

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:04.059
EXAMPLES. SHOWS SIGNIFICANT YOU

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:06.028
KNOW COSTS PER MEGAWATT OF

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:08.864
TRANSFER CAPABILITY SAVINGS

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:11.033
ALMOST A FIVE FOLD SAVINGS PLUS

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.701
YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY SEE THE

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:15.604
ADDITIONAL RIGHT OF WAY SO-

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.572
EFFICIENCIES THERE SO IF WE CAN

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.775
GO IN AND REPURPOSE. EXISTING

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:22.144
RIGHT AWAY WITH SOME OF THE

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.012
SMALLER FACILITIES THAT EXIST

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.581
TODAY. AND AND ADDS LARGER

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.283
TOWERS THERE WE CAN

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:32.654
SIGNIFICANTLY COST EFFECTIVELY-

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:35.190
TO THE TRANSFER- CAPABILITY. THE

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.025
OTHER- QUICK POINT I WANT TO

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.760
MAKE IS OFF OF THAT OTHER SLIDE

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.829
IS JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE COST

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:44.866
OF TRANSMISSION- AND WE'LL SEE

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.335
IN A SECOND THREE DIFFERENT THE

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.403
NATIONAL STUDIES BUT THEY'RE

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.439
LOOKING AT. WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.240
MEET CLEAN ENERGY STANDARDS

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:55.877
ACROSS THE COUNTRY- AND NOT TO

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:58.380
TAKE AWAY- FOR ME MISTER BAKER'S

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.982
COMMENTS ABOUT THE COST OF

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.717
TRANSMISSION I THINK PUT BOTH

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.752
THESE THINGS CAN BE TRUE. THE

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.554
COST OF TRANSMISSION IS

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.122
INCREASING IS AN IMPORTANT

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:10.892
FACTOR. TO KEEP OUR EYES ON BUT

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.494
NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.996
APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY HERE BUT

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.198
IT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:16.765
PERSPECTIVE. BUT THE LARGER

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.333
CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION THAT

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.335
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT AND IF

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:21.837
YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.605
CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES THEY WERE

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.440
GONNA HAVE TO ADD TO THE SYSTEM.

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:27.242
THESE THESE THREE DIFFERENT

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.611
STUDIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LOOK

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:31.313
AT THE TRANSMISSION TO SUPPORT

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.514
THAT AND THE COSTS OF THE

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.149
TRANSMISSION TO SUPPORT THAT YOU

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:35.851
CAN SEE THAT IN THAT CONTEXT THE

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.252
TRANSMISSION IS ACTUALLY A MUCH

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:40.255
SMALLER. PORTION OF THE OVERALL

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.890
INVESTMENTS FOR THE SCREENER TO

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:42.924
TRANSITION THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:44.793
ABOUT SO IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.862
KEEP THAT BROADER PERSPECTIVE

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:48.463
TRANSMISSION ABOUT SMITH IS

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.165
REALLY MEANT TO SAVE COSTS AND

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:55.637
GET ACCESS TO. CHEAPER PREFERRED

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.139
RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE- SO

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:59.708
WITH THAT I THINK. WE'LL START

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:01.843
TO CLOSE AND- LOOK FORWARD ANY

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:04.312
QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION- FROM

01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:06.748
THE PANEL WHICH IS WE WANT TO

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:07.816
EMPHASIZE. THE IMPORTANCE OF

AGENCIES ABOUT. WHAT CAPACITY WE

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.411
NEED TO PLAN FOR HOW THAT

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:46.381
TRANSLATES INTO ACREAGE AND-

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.050
PROXIMITY OF THESE FACILITIES TO

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:51.286
SUBSTATIONS. IF WE CAN DO THAT

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:53.188
WE CAN MOVE OUT OF THE AD HOC

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.257
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE NOW USE

THE INFORMATION WE NEED UP

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:13.808
FRONT. WE CAN- REDUCE THAT TIME.

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.810
TO A MINISTERIAL PERMIT- BY

OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW CHANGING

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:21.216
THE GENERAL PLANS. AND ZONING

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.451
ORDINANCES SO WE CAN ACCOMMODATE

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.220
THESE USES. THAT RIGHT NOW IT

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:26.655
AND I SHOULD SAY REGARDING

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:28.523
ESPECIALLY THE STORAGE UNITS

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.392
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE USE ITSELF

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:31.626
THEY'RE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:32.894
TO FIGURE OUT IT'S REALLY THE

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.896
SETTING WHERE THE SUBSTATIONS

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:37.232
ARE LOCATED. AT THE TIME THEY

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:38.567
WERE ORIGINALLY BUILT MANY OF

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:41.636
THEM- GREAT DEPRESSION ERA

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.004
LOCATIONS THEY WERE ON THE

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.873
PERIPHERY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.209
NOW. THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT HAS

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:48.743
COME AN ENCROACHED AROUND THEM

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:49.811
AND THEIR NUMBER OF MORE

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.813
SENSITIVE RESOURCE ISSUES THAT

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.982
WE NEED TO ADDRESS UNDER THE

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:54.983
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:57.152
BEFORE- WE CAN AUTHORIZED READY

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:59.554
SO THANKS AGAIN FOR THE

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:08.930
LIST OF QUESTIONS HERE THAT I'M

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:11.266
A JUMP INTO BUT OPEN IT UP FOR

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.368
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO A TO

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.337
START OFF. SO FOR MR WHERE- ARM.

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:17.339
AGAIN PUTTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:22.110
FOR- MORE ELECTRIFIED HOMES. AND

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:24.713
ALSO FOR EV'S YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:27.682
TO TAKE IT BACK YOU WOULD HAVE

TO REVISE YOUR LOCAL

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:32.020
INFRASTRUCTURE ARE YOUR

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.822
TRANSFORMERS ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:37.392
TO BE. MADE LARGER- YOU'RE GONNA

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:39.294
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOCAL WIRES

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:42.230
BUT THEY CAN CARRY- IS AND I

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.265
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:45.066
INVOLVED IN THIS PLANNING BUT

CAN YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.670
OR I ALSO FROM THE

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:49.337
REPRESENTATIVE FROM EDISON

WICK FINISHES. YES THANK YOU FOR

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.779
THE QUESTION WELL FORTUNATELY

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:00.382
LOCAL REGULATORS RARELY GET INTO

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:03.051
THAT LEVEL- THAT THAT FIELD WE

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.887
DON'T OCCUPY. AND IT'S- I THINK

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.555
OUR CHALLENGES FACED WITH THAT

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:08.556
AND THEN THIS HAPPENS THROUGHOUT

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.392
CALIFORNIA RELATIVELY OLD OLD

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.761
HOUSING STOCK. SO NOW THAT WE'RE

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.229
THE COST OF MONEY STILL

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:16.464
RELATIVELY CHEAP WE'RE SEEING A

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.333
LOT OF REMODELING AND THAT'S

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.136
WHEN- THE SOLAR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:22.537
AT LEAST ON THE PRIVATE SIDE ON

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:24.239
THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE. BECOMES

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:26.541
OUR PRIMARY FOCUS UNFORTUNATELY

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:29.077
IT'S NOT HOLDING ANYTHING BACK-

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.879
WHEN IT COMES TO LARGER

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:32.614
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT. MY

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:34.716
COLLEAGUES HERE DISCUSSING

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:35.617
CURRENT AND THEN FOR MISS

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:38.186
MARYLAND- HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:39.688
TO HAVE TO REBUILD OF YOUR

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:41.723
CURRENT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE. TO

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.492
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:46.961
DEMAND PROBABLY DOUBLES. WE ARE

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:48.697
GOING THROUGH THE PLANNING

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:51.166
PROCESS SEES RIGHT NOW. AND BUT

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.467
WE DO EXPECT I JUST SPEAK

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.135
DIRECTLY INTO THE MICROPHONE YOU

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:55.470
NEED THEY DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.405
ME AND PEOPLE WILL HEAR YOU MUCH

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.174
BETTER. WE DO EXPECT THAT THE

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.009
DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.944
NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED BOTH TO

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:05.146
MEET THE LOAD OF ALSO TO

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:06.715
INTEGRATE THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:09.884
ROSE MY RESOURCES THAT THE BILL

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:12.020
BE IN A- OTHERS ROOFTOP SOLAR

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.422
OR- OTHER STORAGE FACILITIES AND

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:16.257
SO ON AND SO FORTH. IN ADDITION

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:17.959
LOCALLY BEYOND THE DISTRIBUTION

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:22.063
INFRASTRUCTURE- AS- THE BOSTON

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.933
FEEL PLANS- YOU KNOW I RETIRING.

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:27.869
IN THE IN THE LOCAL AREAS AND TO

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:30.672
BRING IN THE TRANSMISSION TO DO

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:32.207
THAT URBAN LOTS CENTERS. THE

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:33.274
TRANSMISSION OF THE SUB

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:36.177
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:38.480
UPGRADED AS WELL. OKAY BUT DID

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.415
GOING TO DOUBLE RATES RIGHT

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:43.852
REYES AND BY 2% DO WE HAVE ANY

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:46.688
BALLPARK NUMBERS THERE. I AM

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.356
UNABLE TO GIVE YOU AN EXACT

01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:50.358
PERCENTAGE RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:53.728
NOT- IT'S NOT MINIMAL AND I

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:55.563
CANNOT TELL YOU IT IF IT'LL BE

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:56.965
DOUBLE ARE NOT SITTING HERE

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:59.000
RIGHT NOW BUT BE EXPECT

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:02.170
SIGNIFICANT. BUILDOUT NEEDED AT

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:03.671
THE TRANSMISSION AND

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:06.141
DISTRIBUTION LEVELS DO LIKE I

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:08.743
SAID BOTH TO MEET THE- LOAD

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:10.979
GROWTH AND ALSO TO INTERCONNECT

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.947
THE RENEWABLE RESOURCES. AND

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:17.018
THEN MISTER BAKER HAVE YOU BEEN

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:19.120
CONSIDERING THIS ALPHA. LOCAL

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:21.556
REPLACING OF TRANSFORMERS AT

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:25.693
CETERA WILL IMPACT- RIGHT IN

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.663
ADDITION TO TRANSMISSION. YEAH

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:29.964
WE'RE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:32.267
ENTIRE BUILD OUT- YOU KNOW IT'S

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.102
NOT AN ARGUMENT NOT TO DO IT BUT

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:36.171
IT IS AN ARGUMENT TO MAKE SURE

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.306
THAT WE'RE VERY CAREFUL IN WHAT

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.809
THE COSTS ARE. AND THAT WE'RE

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:45.213
LOOKING AT NOT JUST. WHAT THE

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.281
COST OF SERVICES BUT WHEN IT

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.349
MIGHT HIT. RATE PAYER SO THAT IT

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:50.084
CAN BE SPREAD OUT RIGHT BUT BUT

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:51.853
IT IS AN ISSUE WE CARE ABOUT AND

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.589
WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. YES

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:56.191
AND I WAS LISTENING TO ONE OF

01:24:56.257 --> 01:25:01.229
THE- OUR ELECTRIC. LOCAL LAW

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:03.298
ENERGY PRODUCERS AND SUPPLIERS

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.834
THEY WERE SAYING THAT THEY

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:07.635
TALKED ABOUT A PARTICULAR COURT

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.204
. BOB WHERE THERE WERE TWO

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:11.206
TESLAS AND IF SOMEBODY GOT A

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:14.075
THIRD TESLA UNLESS PEOPLE WERE

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:16.110
SMART ENOUGH JUST TO TEST THEM

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:17.779
DIGESTA CHARGE THEM AT THE RIGHT

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:20.081
TIME GOOD FOR YOU OKAY. BUT IF

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:21.950
THEY DIDN'T THAT- THEY'D HAVE TO

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:24.385
PUT IN A NEW TRANSFORMER FOR

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:28.056
THAT PARTICULAR RACK COURT- SO.

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:28.957
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:31.392
SMARTER ENERGY ENERGY- USERS AS

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:38.166
WELL. TAKEN MMHM. I'D LIKE TO

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:40.335
ADD SOMETHING S. LIMIT ASSEMBLY

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:42.871
MEMBER CORK- ONE OF THE

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.506
CHALLENGES IN ANSWERING THE

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:49.143
QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED IS- THE

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.479
- INTERNET UTILITIES. ARE

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:53.915
REQUIRED TO DO THEIR PLANNING

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.384
THEIR GOOD PLANNING BASED ON THE

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:59.187
DEMAND FORECASTS THAT THE CC

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:01.189
PRODUCES THAT'S PART OF THE- I

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:03.591
BURKE. AND THEN THE CQC REQUIRES

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:06.694
US TO USE THAT AND CURRENTLY.

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.696
THE AYE PER FORECAST THAT THE CC

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:10.932
PROVIDES US DOES NOT INCORPORATE

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.434
THE LEVEL OF ELECTRIFICATION AND

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.703
LOAD GROWTH THAT WE BELIEVE IS

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.105
COMING AND WE BELIEVE IT IS

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:18.973
NECESSARY TO MEET THE TWENTY

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.276
FORTY FIVE- CARBON NEUTRALITY

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:24.112
GOALS. SO THAT'S PART OF THE

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:26.214
CHALLENGE OF BEING ABLE TO

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:28.049
ACTUALLY PLAN FOR WHAT WE

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:32.053
BELIEVE COLLECTIVELY IS NEEDED

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.388
FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY. WELL

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:35.089
SOUNDS LIKE OMETHING THE CHAIR

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:36.925
CAN LOOK INTO OVER THE NEXT

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:39.694
MONTHS OR YEARS. THANK YOU MR

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.963
THANK YOU GOOD QUESTION IT CAN

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.731
GET INTO THE COST SIDE OF THINGS

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:44.999
AND EVERYONE'S WELCOME TO

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:46.534
ADDRESS THIS LAST INFORMATION

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.436
HEARING HELD FOCUSED ON THE

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.538
RISING ELECTRICITY RATES. HERE

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.006
IN CALIFORNIA AND CUSTOMERS

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:53.074
FINDING THEMSELVES IN A VERY

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:55.009
DIFFICULT SPOT THE GOVERNOR

01:26:55.076 --> 01:26:56.344
PROPOSES SOME ADDITIONAL

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:58.780
RESOURCES FOR THE AREA-

01:26:58.846 --> 01:26:59.547
CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.182
WERE EXCITED TO SEE THE NUMBER

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:02.784
THAT THESE BUT FORWARD. CLEARLY

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.352
PAINTING THE PICTURE THAT PEOPLE

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:06.287
ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH- PAIN

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:08.756
THOSE UTILITY BILLS. SO I'D LIKE

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:10.658
TO SPEND SOME TIME IN TERMS OF

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:13.628
WATER SPECIFIC- ACTION ITEMS

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:15.330
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:17.131
IT RELATES TO THE BUILD OUT OF

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:20.168
THIS. TRANSMISSION NEED THAT WE

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:21.102
HAVE TO MEET THESE AMBITIOUS

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:23.204
GOALS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME-

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.772
KEEPING IN MIND- THESE COSTS

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:28.176
THAT ULTIMATELY- IMPACT- REGULAR

01:27:28.242 --> 01:27:30.511
FOLKS. IN CALIFORNIA WILL DEAL

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:31.913
WITH A MISTER MAKER FIRST AND

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.015
THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP TO OTHERS.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.050
GIVEN THAT YOU DID UP A TOUCH ON

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:37.952
SOME POTENTIAL. IDEAS OR

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:47.929
SOLUTIONS ON THAT FRONT. YEAH I. I- I THINK WE NEED TO ROUTE

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:51.032
EVERYTHING IN WHERE DO WE NEED

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.867
TO BE IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO WE

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.736
HAVE TO START THERE AND HAVE TO

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.604
WORK BACKWARDS SO I DEFINITELY

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.306
AGREE THAT AND YOU KNOW AND I

01:27:58.373 --> 01:27:59.974
THINK CARDS DONE A PRETTY GOOD

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.943
JOB IN LAYING OUT KIND OF

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:03.544
DIRECTIONALLY WHERE WE SHOULD BE

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:05.880
GOING AND WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:08.683
THAT INTO INTO THE PLANNING

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.652
PROCESSES- I YOU KNOW I DO

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:12.620
THINK- YOU KNOW IT ALL STARTS

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.389
WITH WHAT WE NEED WHEN WE NEED

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:18.126
IT. IS A PLANNING PROCESS- I

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:20.194
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:22.063
KNOW THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.831
BRING SOME EFFICIENCIES OUT OF

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:25.233
THE SYSTEM WE'VE LAID OUT A

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:28.302
COUPLE WAYS- LET'S LOOK AT HOW

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:30.238
WE'RE FINANCING THESE

01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:31.806
INVESTMENTS THEIR ENORMOUS THERE

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.174
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:34.475
THE CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING WE

01:28:34.542 --> 01:28:36.577
HAVE TO DO THEIR HUGE. I MEAN

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:39.080
THAT THAT THE OVERALL INVESTMENT

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:43.251
WILL BE HUGE. HEY SO HOW DO WE

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.652
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE WAYS THAT

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:47.055
WE CAN AND- WE TRANSMISSION H.

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.189
THERE GENERALLY SAFE INVESTMENTS

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:52.894
TO SELL- SO LOOKING AT THAT- I

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.463
WOULD ALSO. POINT OUT THAT I

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.532
THINK WE SHOULD REALLY TAKE A

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:59.434
CLOSE LOOK AT. YOU KNOW THE

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.836
SITING. AND PERMITTING

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:06.574
PROCESSES- BECAUSE I IT. IT IS

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:08.609
THE I BELIEVE THAT THEY WHAT WE

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.578
THINK THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.113
DRIVING UP. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.581
THE COSTS BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:15.483
HELPING TO STRETCH THE TIME

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.285
FRAME OUT AND WE REALLY NEED TO

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:18.986
WORK- YOU KNOW COLLECTIVELY TO

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:20.188
BUILD THINGS AS QUICKLY AS WE

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:22.323
POSSIBLY CAN IN THE MOST COST

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.791
EFFECTIVE MANNER. I THINK I'LL

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:28.463
LEAVE MY REMARKS THERE- IT. THAT

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.898
BUT HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:33.134
SOME OF THE OTHER IDEAS WE HALF

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.135
. IN HERE FROM OTHER BALANCE ON

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:38.940
THIS AS WELL. IS IT AYE I WOULD

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:41.209
JUST SPEND ADD TO THAT- YOU KNOW

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:42.443
IN OUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:44.145
PROCESS AND I THINK THIS IS

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:44.946
SOMETHING YOU'VE HEARD FROM

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:46.647
OTHERS AS WELL WE OFTEN CALL IT

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:47.849
THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:49.484
PROCESS BUT WE DO LOOK FOR OTHER

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:50.284
ALTERNATIVES WHAT'S THE LOWEST

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.153
COST WAY TO MEET THE NEED. AND

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.855
THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF ACTIVITY

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:55.523
ON NOT ONLY WHERE STORAGE MAY

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.458
EMERGE ON ITS OWN BUT WHERE WE

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.660
SHOULD BE TRYING TO WORK WITH

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.329
PEOPLE BUYING STORAGE TO GET

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:02.530
LOCATED AT THE MOST AFFECTED

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.365
AREAS. WE ALSO INCLUDE IN OUR

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:06.634
OWN STUDY WORK EACH YEAR WE

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:07.368
STARTED AN ANNUAL PROCESS OF

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.537
INCLUDING HOW MUCH STORAGE IN

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:10.805
CERTAIN AREAS WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.240
EFFECTIVE AT HELPING MEET LOCAL

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:14.108
NEEDS BEFORE YOU START BUMPING

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:16.077
INTO THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:17.278
CHARGE THAT STORAGE IN ORDER TO

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:18.980
HAVE IT AVAILABLE AT THE NEXT

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:21.115
PEAK LOAD. SO THESE ARE PRODUCER

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.917
SOLUTIONS WERE TRYING TO GET AS

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:24.552
MUCH VISIBILITY OF AN

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.454
TRANSPARENCY ON AS POSSIBLE AND

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.924
LOOK FOR THE LOWEST COST IN THE

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:32.326
LONG RUN. AS MR BECAUSE SLIDE

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:33.461
SHOW THOSE QUITE OFTEN. WHEN

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:34.195
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.464
TRANSMISSION COSTS THEY SEE THE

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:37.598
COST BUT THE BENEFITS SHOWS UP

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:39.433
SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND WE NEED TO

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.135
MAKE SURE THAT OUR DECISIONS ARE

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.270
TAKING ALL OF THE COSTS AND

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:44.138
BENEFITS INTO ACCOUNT. WHETHER

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:45.907
THAT'S A TRANSMISSION SOLUTION

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:48.176
STORAGE OR OTHER NEW EMERGING

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:49.977
TECHNOLOGIES. WE'VE ALSO BEEN

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.013
LOOKING AT- AT DIFFERENT OF

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:53.614
APPLICATIONS OF FLOW CONTROL

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:56.083
DEVICES TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.119
THE INTEGRATED GRID. AS OPPOSED

01:30:58.186 --> 01:30:59.020
TO JUST PUTTING POWER FLOW WHERE

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:01.489
IT WANTS TO. OUR PHYSICS TAKES

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:03.191
IT OUT THAT WE CAN BE MORE

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:04.625
ACTIVELY CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:06.594
TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICITY. TO

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:07.628
MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.030
FACILITIES WE HAVEN'T THAT WE'RE

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:10.898
ADDING TO THE GRID. SO THAT

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.166
HOLISTIC VIEW IS REALLY

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.534
IMPORTANT TO COMING UP WITH THE

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:15.236
BEST OVERALL SOLUTION AND THE

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.071
INTEREST RATE PAYERS. BUT ALSO

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:19.073
INVOLVES LOOKING OUT LONGER TERM

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.242
NOT JUST WHAT'S THE- WHAT'S THE

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.176
CHEAPEST TODAY. BUT WHAT

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:26.914
PROVIDES THE BEST VALUE OVER

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.049
FIVE TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:36.324
YEARS. YOU HAVE NOT OF YOU HAVE

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:38.092
- YES YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT AND

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.327
EQUITY ALL THE IT'S OF PART OF

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:41.829
THIS. SO THE TWO- SOLUTIONS THAT

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:44.031
I TALKED ABOUT IN MY REMARKS-

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.434
I'LL COME BACK TO THOSE BECAUSE

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.503
IF WE CAN A PROACTIVELY PLAN IF

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:52.473
YOU GET A HEAD OFF UP- YOU KNOW

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.476
FOR THE LONGER TERM THAT- LEADS

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:57.478
TO A MANAGED TRANSITION AND A

01:31:57.545 --> 01:31:59.847
MANAGED TRANSITION WILL BE LESS

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:03.150
COSTLY THAN TRYING TO CATCH UP

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.219
AT THE END. DOING JUST IN TIME

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:07.255
UPGRADES ESPECIALLY FOR THE

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:08.222
LARGE BUILD OUTS LIKE A

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:10.324
TRANSMISSION PROJECTS AND THE

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.226
SECOND POINT IS ABOUT APPROVAL

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:14.595
OTHERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT THE

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:16.998
LICENSING PERMITTING REVISITING

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:19.934
THE NEED THESE ALL ADDS TO TIME

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:23.104
AND TIME EAGLES MONEY- EXTENDING

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.605
EIGHT TO TEN YEARS ALREADY LONG

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:29.677
SOMETIMES IT TAKES LONGER- SO. I

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:31.812
AND BIT ALSO KEEP IN MIND COUPLE

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.714
OF OTHER POINTS. THESE SEEMS

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.483
LIKE BIG INVESTMENTS BUT THESE

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:38.219
UNNECESSARY. IT IS INVESTMENTS

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:40.554
ARE IN ALICE'S SHOWS THAT IN THE

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.990
LONG RUN THE ENERGY COSTS FOR

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:44.926
CUSTOMERS WILL ACTUALLY GO DOWN

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:47.395
BY A THIRD DESPITE ALL THESE

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:48.696
INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.631
TODAY. WHETHER IT'S ON THE-

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.300
RENEWABLE GENERATION SIDE ALL

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:55.169
THE GREAT SIDE. AND LASTLY YOU

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.971
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS AS WE

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:59.140
LOOK AT AFFORDABILITY IS NOT

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:01.075
ONLY THE COST OFF THE GRID

01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:01.976
UPGRADES AND THE INVESTMENTS

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:06.414
NEEDED. BUT ALSO. THE COST OF

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.648
INACTION THE COST OF NOT DOING

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:09.450
IT. ESPECIALLY WITH CLIMATE

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:11.919
CHANGE AND MAKING SURE THAT IT'S

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:13.421
NOT THAT BAD EVERYONE IN

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:16.023
CALIFORNIA EVEN THE- PEOPLE WHO.

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.758
ARE DISADVANTAGED OR VULNERABLE

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:20.728
IN SOME OTHER WAY KATTAN- BUT

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:23.464
DISSIPATE SO HE'S IN A- BEGIN TO

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:26.267
LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:27.535
BOTH THE COST OF DOING AND COST

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:30.004
OF NOT. UGH GOING AHEAD WITH

01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:31.973
THESE INVESTMENTS THANK YOU.

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:33.975
THIS BAKER HI I WAS JUST GONNA

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:36.444
ADD ONE LAST STRATEGY TO THE YOU

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:37.511
KNOW LOWER THE COST LOOK AT THE

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:40.348
FINANCING- THAT THAT THE LAST

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:41.949
PIECES WHEN SOMETHING CAN HIT

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:44.652
THE RATE PAYERS BECAUSEOFTENTIMES WHICH YOU'LL SEE AS-

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:45.786
YOU KNOW THERE'S INCREASES IN

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.088
TRANSMISSION AND THERE'S BE AN

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:48.189
INCREASE INVESTMENT AND

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:49.557
DISTRIBUTION THERE'S WILD FIRE

01:33:49.623 --> 01:33:50.891
THERE'S ALL OF THESE THINGS AND

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:53.661
THEY START TO PANCAKE OP. SO TO

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:54.929
WHAT EXTENT AND THIS IS YOU KNOW

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.630
WE NEED TO BE STRATEGIC ON HOW

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.099
WE DO THIS AND THINK ABOUT IT ON

01:33:58.165 --> 01:34:00.034
THE WHOLE SYSTEM BUT TO WHAT

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:00.935
EXTENT CAN INVESTMENTS BE

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:03.170
DEFERRED EVEN IF IT'S FOR A

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:04.171
TEMPORARY SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:06.040
OR CAN TO WHAT EXTENT CAN THE

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:07.475
IMPACTS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS ON

01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:11.812
RATES BE DEFERRED THROUGH OTHER

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.581
MECHANISMS. SO ANYONE ELSE. LIKE

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:17.752
TO ADD. YEAH I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:19.687
ALL THE ANSWERS FROM THE OTHER

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:21.155
PANELISTS AND BUILDING OFF OF

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:23.557
WHAT MR BAKER WAS JUST SAYING

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:25.526
THERE I THINK ALSO BEING MINDFUL

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:29.930
OF AS ELECTRIFICATION- MATURES

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:31.732
YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD HELP US

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.367
SPREAD AROUND THE COST OF SOME

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.802
OF THESE LARGER INVESTMENTS AND

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:36.837
WELL SO IT REALLY IS A MATTER OF

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.406
TIMING AND STAGING MAKE SURE

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.141
THEY WERE BRINGING UP THE RATE

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:41.075
BASE AS A ROUTING UPSET SOME

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.477
COSTS TO IT. RIGHT GOOD COUPLE

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:45.212
QUESTIONS- LET'S GET YOUR

01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:46.514
OPINIONS ON THE INTERSTATE

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.516
TRANSMISSION CONCEPT AND DOES

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:50.284
THAT HELP US AND THE IMMEDIATE-

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.719
DOES THAT PUT US IN A BETTER

01:34:51.786 --> 01:34:53.788
POSITION TO MEET NOT JUST OUR-

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:56.390
VICIOUS GOALS BUT- STABILIZES

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:58.626
THE GREAT SYSTEM THE OTHER

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.795
QUESTION IS- YOU KNOW I MADE

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.630
REFERENCE IN MY OPENING COMMENTS

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:04.065
THAT LAST TRANSMISSION LINE TOOK

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.900
NINE YEARS TO SITE PERMIT AND

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:08.436
APPROVAL I MEAN IS THAT THE

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:09.970
BASELINE THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:11.038
TO BE POINTED TO THAT IT'S GOING

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:12.239
TO TAKE THAT LONG. TO BUILD

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:13.707
ADDITIONAL TRANSMISSION IN

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.543
CALIFORNIA OR IS THAT A UNIQUE

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:17.711
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT- TOOK THAT

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.613
LONG I MEAN I'D LOVE TO HEAR

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.348
PERSPECTIVES ON BOTH OF THOSE-

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:23.150
QUESTIONS FROM PANELISTS WHO

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:27.121
WANTED. TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:30.124
THAT. SO WITH REGARD. TURKEY

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.592
WITH REGARDS TO- INTERSTATE

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:34.395
TRANSMISSION I THINK- A WELL

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:37.498
PLANNED- INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:39.500
CAN BE QUITE EFFECTIVE IN

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.936
ACCESSING A DIVERSE SET OF

01:35:42.002 --> 01:35:43.971
TECHNOLOGIES AND GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:46.107
DIVERSE OTHER RESOURCES. IT HAS

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:49.910
TO COME WITH A- A ACCEPTED

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:52.012
RESOURCE PLAN THAT A KNOWLEDGES

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:52.947
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:35:53.013 --> 01:35:54.849
RESOURCES DEVELOPED AND

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:57.151
CONTRACTED IN THAT IN AND ACROSS

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:59.220
THE REGION IF IT DOESN'T THEN

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:01.155
IT'S A IT'S AN INVESTMENT TO

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:03.357
NOWHERE SO IT HAS TO BE AGAIN

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.792
COORDINATED WITH THE RESOURCE

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.760
DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCE.

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:09.730
PROCUREMENT PLANNING- I THINK

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:12.133
THE AS A GENERAL MATTER THE

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:15.136
HAVING A ROBUST- INTERSTATE

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:17.171
TRANSMISSION GRID ALLOWS US TO

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:20.241
OPTIMIZE THE SYSTEM AND

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:21.709
OPERATIONALLY WE SEE THE

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:24.745
BENEFITS OF THAT THROUGH THE

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:25.379
WESTERN ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET-

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:25.846
WE EXPECT THAT THOSE

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:27.715
OPPORTUNITIES WILL INCREASE AND

01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:29.416
THOSE REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:31.685
WILL INCREASE OVER TIME- BUT IT

01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:33.154
HAS AGAIN COME ALONG WITH SOME

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.623
COORDINATED- RESOURCE AND

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:38.392
TRANSMISSION PLANNING CONCEPTS

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:41.128
ON. ONE AND I THINK. I DO NOT

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:43.864
AGREE WITH THAT AND JUST ON THE

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:45.399
ISSUE OF TIMING- I HAVE TO ADMIT

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.034
UNTIL WE SEE THINGS SHIFTING

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:48.769
WERE ASSUMING TOSS THE WORST

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:50.371
CASE THAT THESE TYPES OF

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:51.772
PROCESSES WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE

01:36:51.839 --> 01:36:54.008
THIS LONG. THAT'S NOT IDEAL BUT

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:55.743
THAT'S OVER HAVING TO BREAK INTO

01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:57.878
OUR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE LIKE YOU

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:59.813
SAID UNTIL THERE IS- PROGRESS

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.349
ON. FINDING WAYS TO STREAMLINE

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:03.984
THE PERMIT THE PERMITTING AND

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:06.086
SHORTEN THOSE TIME LINES WHICH

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.188
IS WHERE THE BULK OF THE TIME

01:37:07.254 --> 01:37:09.290
SPENT TO BE BLUNT THE AMOUNT OF

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:10.157
CONCERN TIME SPENT ON ACTUAL

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:13.227
CONSTRUCTION NOW IS BECOMING A

01:37:13.294 --> 01:37:14.862
VERY SMALL PART OF THE TIMELINE

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.730
. THAT- UNTIL THERE'S SOME

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:18.432
PROGRESS WERE WERE HAVING TO

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:19.800
MAKE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS INTO OUR

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:21.168
WORK BUT THAT'S BECAUSE NOT

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:23.170
BECAUSE WE WANT TO THAT'S OUR

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:25.005
THAT'S OUR REALITY SO THAT'S

01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:26.006
WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO PLAN

01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:31.312
AROUND- BUT- BUT IT'S NOT IDEAL

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:33.447
. WHEN I WAS WANTING TO ADD TO

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:34.682
EITHER ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:36.817
THAT. TIME FRAME AND OR THE

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:38.752
INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION IDEA.

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:41.255
JUST ON THE ON THE REGIONAL GRID

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:42.823
I WAS JUST EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:44.692
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN ORDER TO

01:37:44.758 --> 01:37:46.026
BE ABLE TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:48.429
GOALS BOTH RELIABLY AND COST

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:49.597
EFFECTIVELY IT'S REALLY

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:52.700
IMPOSSIBLE. TO IMAGINE DOING ALL

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.802
THREE OF THOSE SAYINGS RELIABLE

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:58.172
COST EFFECTIVE- AND CLEAN

01:37:58.239 --> 01:37:59.640
WITHOUT A MORE REGIONAL ALLIES

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:02.209
STE. GRID ON THE TIMING FOR

01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:03.844
TRANSMISSION. I THINK I WOULD

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:06.046
JUST SAY WE SHOULD- PLAN FOR THE

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:08.515
WORST AND HOPE FOR THE BEST AND

01:38:08.582 --> 01:38:10.117
WORK TO BEAT THOSE TIME LINES AS

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.819
WELL BUT IT'S DEFINITELY URGENT

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:13.420
TO GET STARTED. YOU KNOW

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:15.856
RECOGNIZING THOSE LONGER

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:18.892
TIMELINES IN THE PAST. PLEASE

01:38:18.959 --> 01:38:21.161
YEAH I'LL JUST ADD ON YOU KNOW I

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:22.730
THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO HAVE

01:38:22.796 --> 01:38:24.598
DEAL GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY FOR

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:26.233
THE REASONS EVERYONE ELSE-

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.003
NOTED- I THINK ANOTHER REASON TO

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:30.738
FORMALIZE ANY KIND OF ROOM

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:33.607
REGIONAL- TRANSMISSION IS IT

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:35.142
ALSO ALLOWS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:36.343
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AGREED

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.512
UPON COST ALLOCATION BETWEEN THE

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:40.848
DIFFERENT REGIONS WHICH I THINK

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:44.318
WOULD ALSO GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:45.619
EASING THAT. OKAY RIGHT IF FOR

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:48.322
NO ONE'S GONNA AT ADD ON TO

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:49.423

CENTER FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:10.063
RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES FIRST ON

AND TO THE MEMBERS AND THE

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.202
PANELISTS FOR THIS VERY VERY

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:16.036
GOOD HEARING COVERED A LOT OF

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:18.005
GROUND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN GOOD.

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.407
IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- ONE

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:22.309
OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE ABOUT

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:24.478
THE COST OF TRANSMISSION IS IF

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:26.013
YOU KNEW THE HISTORY OF THE TO

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:28.415
HATCH A P. LINE AND HOW THAT

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:29.483
UNDERGROUNDING PROJECT HAPPENED

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.351
IT IT'S A SCANDAL WAS THE

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.187
INTERVENTION OF PRESIDENT PEAVEY

01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:35.055
ON BEHALF OF A OF THE CITY AT

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:39.793
CHINO HILLS. THE TRANSMISSION

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.061
RIGHT AWAY WAS WITH THE- LINE

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:42.062
WAS ALL. THERE WAS JUST NEXT.

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:43.464
WITHIN EXISTING RIGHT AWAY AND

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:46.200
PEAVEY OF FORCED EDERSON TO

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:48.902
UNDERGROUND AT A COST OF SOME

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:50.337
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:52.172
SO THAT'S A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.675
WHEN YOU HEAR PG&amp;E TELL YOU THAT

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.376
WE HAVE. ABOUT TEN THOUSAND

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:58.512
MILES WORTH OF TRANSMISSION

01:41:58.579 --> 01:42:00.681
WE'RE GOING UNDERGROUND WHAT

01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:02.249
THAT'S THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:04.351
AND THAT AMOUNTS TO ALL THE

01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:07.421
MONEY THAT THAT. THAT THAT UP

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:08.522
TWENTY YOUR OUTLOOK WAS GOING TO

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:11.058
COST. SO WHILE WE UNDERSTAND

01:42:11.124 --> 01:42:12.993
WELFARE PROTECTION IS IMPORTANT

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.795
UNDERGROUNDING IS THE HIGH COST

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:17.164
SOLUTION IS NOT THE FIRST THING

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:18.499
THAT WE SHOULD DO WE HAVE MICRO

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:19.933
GRIDS WE HAVE OTHER ALTERNATIVES

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.369
SO. SO THAT'S THAT'S A COMMENT

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:24.738
THAT I WANTED TO MAKE- THE OTHER

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.707
THING I WOULD JUST OBSERVE IS

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:28.909
THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:31.211
GOVERNOR HAS TO PUT MONEY FROM

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:33.714
THE STATE BUDGET INTO BUYING

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:36.750
SUPPLEMENTAL- ENERGY RESERVES IS

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:38.585
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.721
TRANSMISSION THAT IS AVAILABLE

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:42.623
TO DELIVER THE PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:45.058
READY TO COME ONLINE. AND THAT'S

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:47.361
A FAILURE ON THE PART

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:49.830
PRINCIPALLY OF THE PC. BECAUSE

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.765
THEY PRACTICE THE JUST IN TIME

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.767
PHILOSOPHY THAT WE CAN WAIT

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.202
THERE'S NO HURRY WE'VE GOT

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:56.470
ENOUGH AND IT TURNS OUT THEY

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:58.939
WERE WRONG YOU KNOW THE IMPORTS

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.707
FROM THE RETIREMENT OF COAL.

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:03.076
WENT AWAY FOR MUCH FASTER OF THE

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:06.346
GAS PLANTS CONTINUE TO BE OLD

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:07.814
AND DIRTY AND INEFFICIENT THE

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:09.082
CLEAN ENERGY IS WHAT'S GOING TO

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:11.351
BOTH LOWER COSTS AS WELL AS

01:43:11.418 --> 01:43:13.186
INCREASE RELIABILITY SO THIS IS

01:43:13.253 --> 01:43:14.955
A REALLY IMPORTANT SUBJECT AND I

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:17.624

TALKING AND ENERGY HEARING- BUT

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:00.914
ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:02.916
SPEAK TODAY IS THAT ENERGY IS

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:03.917
INCREASINGLY BECOMING ONE OF THE

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:05.185
LARGEST COSTS FOR THE STATE

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:07.420
WATER CONTRACTORS AS WE WORK ON

HOLDING THIS. IMPORTANT AND FOR

INFORMATIONAL HEARING I THINK

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:24.591
IT'S IMPORTANT TOPIC- I'LL JUST

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:27.761
SAY THAT THE DIET SO IS VERY

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:29.796
COGNIZANT OF THE NEXUS BETWEEN-

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:33.533
RELIABILITY- A CLEAN ENERGY AND

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.002
AFFORDABILITY AND- WE'RE DOING

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:38.305
EVERYTHING WE CAN AS PART OF

01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:40.707
THE- THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:43.376
FRAMEWORK TO BUILD OUT THE RIGHT

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:45.145
TRANSMISSION IN AN AFFORDABLE

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:47.080
WAY IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY WE

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:48.114
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GET

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:51.151
AHEAD OF. RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

01:49:51.217 --> 01:49:52.886
BUT WE CERTAINLY DO WANT TO KEEP

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:54.254
UP WITH THAT AND WE RECOGNIZE

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:56.189
THAT THE PACE OF RESOURCE

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:59.326
DEVELOPMENT HAS TO INCREASE-

01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:00.827
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:03.930
ABOUT- SOLUTIONS. ARE I THINK

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:05.865
THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION AND I

01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:07.901
THINK IT'S AN AND SITUATION WE

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:09.669
HAVE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS.

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:12.439
INCLUDING AS- HOW DO WE GET

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:16.443
DEMAND. ON A TO- REDUCE AT

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:17.844
CERTAIN TIMES THAT REDUCES

01:50:17.911 --> 01:50:19.813
DEMAND FOR TRANSMISSION REDUCES

01:50:19.879 --> 01:50:21.448
DEMAND FOR ENERGY WHEN YOU NEED

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:23.416
IT CERTAINLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:50:23.483 --> 01:50:25.685
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO AFRICAN

01:50:25.752 --> 01:50:26.152
SHAPE ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:28.822
CONSUMPTION. TO TIMES WHEN WE'RE

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:30.824
NOT OTHERWISE PEAKING THAT HELPS

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:33.393
THE SYSTEM- IF WE CAN MOVE WATER

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:35.228
THROUGH THE SYSTEM AT TIMES WHEN

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:37.831
WE ARE NOT- PEAKING THAT IS

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:42.369
CERTAINLY A SOLUTION. SO I THINK

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:44.471
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE MAN

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.873
SIDES- SUPPLY SIDE AND THEN COME

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.175
IN WITH A REASONABLE-

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:50.777
TRANSMISSION PLAN THAT LOOKS AT

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:53.480
AND ALIGNS WITH THOSE OTHER

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.015
SOLUTIONS WHETHER IT BE IN STATE

01:50:55.081 --> 01:50:57.550
OR ACROSS THE REGION AND WE HAVE

01:50:57.617 --> 01:50:59.119
TO REACH OUT TO OUR NEIGHBORS

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:00.353
ACROSS THE REGION BECAUSE WE IF

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:01.888
WE DO. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT WE

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:04.157
CAN'T DO IT ALONE WE HAVE TO DO

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:05.358
IT IN A COORDINATED MANNER. SO

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:07.427
WITH THAT I AGAIN APPRECIATE THE

01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:08.395
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:10.463
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION IT'S NOT

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:12.399
THE END OF DISCUSSION I'M SURE

01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:14.234
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THIS BUT-

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:18.705
THANK YOU. I'M FINE YES. THE

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:20.774

A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:24.577
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES MENTIONED

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:27.680
SEEK WORK REFORM S. SEQUEL BEEN

01:51:27.747 --> 01:51:30.917
A MAJOR ISSUE IN CITING. UP OUR

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:34.788
PLANT POWER LINES. ACTUALLY IT'S

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.156
THE COMPONENT THAT REQUIRES

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:37.957
ANOTHER DETERMINATION OF THE

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:40.193
NEED FOR THE PROJECT THAT IS

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:41.161
WHERE IT'S SOME OF THE

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:43.029
DUPLICATION OCCURS AND ALSO THE

01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:44.998

REVISIT THE NEED ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.910
AND THAT THAT CAN ADD EASILY AND

01:51:56.976 --> 01:51:59.479
HAS ADDED YEARS IN ITSELF TO

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:02.015
DIFFERENT PROJECTS WELL SO THAT

01:52:02.082 --> 01:52:05.151

01:52:15.462 --> 01:52:17.030
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:19.065
SHOULD DO AND IF IT IS IN FACT

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:22.302
DUPLICATIVE. WEAKER IDEA REFORM

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:25.438
SYKORA IN SOME WAY BUT THAT

01:52:25.505 --> 01:52:26.973

WHAT WE DO THINK THAT IT IS

01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:40.566
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT. HOW ARE

01:55:40.633 --> 01:55:44.103
FINANCING THESE IN GIVEN THE-

01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:45.672
MAGNITUDE OF ALL OF THE

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:47.140
INVESTMENTS OVER DOING INTO THE

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.174
SYSTEM. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:50.009

THEY CAN HIT RATE PAYERS. AT A

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.157

TOUCH QUICKLY ON THE ON THE

01:56:57.176 --> 01:57:00.279
SEQUEL A QUESTION- WE HAVE BEEN

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:02.315
LOOKING AT SOME POTENTIAL

01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:04.884
CHANGES THERE AND I AM- FAMILIAR

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.719
WITH AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE WHERE.

01:57:06.786 --> 01:57:08.254
JUST THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:09.956
NOT A LINE WE CONDUCT DURING

01:57:10.022 --> 01:57:11.257
WHICH AGAIN IS ALL WITHIN

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:12.825
EXISTING RIGHT AWAY WHO WOULD

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:14.293
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE FULL C.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:18.364
PCM PROCESS. ONE OF THE LESSER-

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:19.198
PERMIT TO CONSTRUCT PROCESS

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:22.635
THESE- TAKES UP A YEAR'S ORTH

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:23.403
OF TIME OF A TRANSMISSION

01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:25.571
OWNER'S. LAWYERS TALKING WITH

01:57:25.638 --> 01:57:26.773
THE SECRET DIVISION JUST TO

01:57:26.839 --> 01:57:28.408
FIGURE OUT WHICH APPLICATION CAN

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:30.042
BE FILED. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE

01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:31.911
EXAMPLE WHERE- SOME VERY

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:34.881
STRATEGIC. CHANGES TO CLEARLY

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:37.216
DEFINE YOU KNOW WHERE THAT

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:39.252
DEMARCATION LINE IS- COULD COULD

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:40.086
POTENTIALLY SHAVE OFF A YEAR'S

01:57:40.153 --> 01:57:43.055
WORTH OF TIME. IN THAT EXAMPLE-

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:44.791
BUT IN CLOSING I WOULD. JUST

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:46.392
EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:48.661
ADDRESS THE COST QUESTIONS FOR

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:50.563
CONSUMERS. I THINK IT WAS

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:52.064
pCRITICAL THERE IS FOCUSING ON

01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:55.101
BILLS. AND ALL ENERGY COSTS TO

01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:58.070
CONSUMERS NET NET- AS WE

01:57:58.137 --> 01:58:00.006
TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY. I

01:58:00.072 --> 01:58:01.274
WOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THE

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.743
IMPORTANCE OF STATE LEADERSHIP

01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:04.844
ON TRANSMISSION QUESTIONS I

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:07.280
THINK. MAYBE NEED A NEW APPROACH

01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:11.484
THERE THE- MULTI AGENCY. PROCESS

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:14.053
THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN TAKES

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:16.155
ABOUT SIX YEARS TO IDENTIFY. AND

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:17.790
APPROVE NEW TO NEW TRANSMISSION

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:19.559
I THINK THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG

01:58:19.625 --> 01:58:21.194
SO WE NEED A MORE TARGETED.

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:23.162
APPROACH TO THAT AND THEN JUST

01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:24.797
STOP AT THE SIZING IMPORTANCE

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:29.669
