I am a Roman so I don't study

I'm also the chair of public

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.998
safety and like that would help

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.733
people I been the more prisons

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.102
ever wanted to in my entire life

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:59.539
and I when I first got elected

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.708
in two thousand twelve every

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.142
private prison because that

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.410
that time we had we're in

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:05.845
mass incarceration we had

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.314
incarcerated more people

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.582
in California did any other

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.417
state and in most cases any

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.886
other country -- I asked

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.555
the private prisons why they

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.624
were my office and they said

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.858
that they needed ten thousand

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.594
more prison beds over the next

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.130
-- ten years and I asked him

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.565
how we're able to come up with

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.700
that number and how accurate

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.636
was and they said they were

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.070
actors she was about ninety

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.872
nine to a hundred percent

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.741
accuracy that they would need

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:37.510
ten thousand more prison beds

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.445
and I say well what was your

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.748
algorithm what was your would

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:43.516
you use no I I'm expecting

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.184
some for the teachers in here

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.021
I'm expecting some out long

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.789
and drawn out algebraic

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.693
kind of a -- example

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.762
and he basically said to me

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.797
we can we know by the number

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.499
third graders they can't read at

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.267
third grade how many more prison

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.603
beds we will need SB in

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.905
from south LA and your in my

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.307
district -- represents south

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.543
LA of I said why don't we

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.712
educate those individuals so

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:13.813
we can determine how many more

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.181
universities and colleges we

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.083
need to build in clap with that

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.487
but the next thing you

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.156
should really clap about is

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.625
since two thousand twelve

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.026
none of those private

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.061
prisons have ever come

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.962
back to my office again to

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.264
talk to me about anything

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.135
so it is said to me that

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.138
maybe the solution it's close

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.441
enough the pipeline we spent a

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:42.809
lot of money a rehabilitation

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.143
which you still we still should

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.045
do making sure people get out

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.346
and it become function many

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.449
members of society but also

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:51.651
woke me up to the fact that --

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.420
if we cut off that pipeline

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.789
and squeeze it till it's just

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.224
impossible for any of our

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.525
young people to go through

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.862
the whole system in the whole

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:05.031
world would change and so

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.934
-- on behalf of the of the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.269
speaker the legislature -- I

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:11.637
want to welcome everyone to

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.306
this this is the second hearing

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.341
of the select committee on

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.476
ending the school to prison

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.045
pipeline in our first hearing

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.514
we heard from educators DCS

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:22.915
using various organizations

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.884
discussing the crucial role of

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.853
teachers the teachers play in

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.888
ending the cycle of and promote

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.823
the education not incarceration

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:32.692
my colleagues and I and I have

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.393
spent years about the issues

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.329
are communities face we heard

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:37.497
about the need for teachers

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.398
that understand the trauma I

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.167
mean the trauma our students

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.769
experience the need for more

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.905
school based health services

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.673
and that's why we're here today

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:50.209
addressing trauma through

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:52.512
supportive services and programs

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:53.780
and wraparound services on

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:55.982
campus this have been a frequent

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.683
topic of conversation the route

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.552
this legislative year how can

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:01.087
we expect our students to learn

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.989
to succeed in the classroom if

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.423
we're not providing the services

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.592
they need and to create an

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:07.827
environment where they feel they

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.729
can access this help this is

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.631
why fought with fifty million

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:13.266
dollars in the state budget

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.201
over the last years the fund the

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.037
youth diversion programs

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.072
this system we have now takes

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.908
our children from classroom to

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:24.210
prison it's really time to in

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.412
that they will be looking at

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.780
what current program through

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.582
providing for students and

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:30.983
their families as well as what

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.351
are additional steps we can

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.020
take to help them overcome the

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:36.055
barriers to their success I know

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.690
how important is the issue is

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.959
and what and which is why I

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.428
this year I worked on AB two

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.430
five eight a bill to establish

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.199
a grant program that button

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.267
student support services and

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.402
their integration within the

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.871
surrounding community we look we

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:54.340
must look at our children as at

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.976
promise right now we

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:58.911
call our children at risk

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.815
which kind of focuses on

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.851
maybe one mistake for two

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.219
mistakes that they've done

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:07.954
they carry that label with

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.488
them throughout their school

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.991
academic year sometimes

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.459
when a in a criminal justice

get rid of that term of at risk

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.736
take it out education code

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.271
and take it out of the penal

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:28.107
code and call our young people

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.176
who have challenges call them

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:32.478
at promise miss of the

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.114
future they're not gangsters

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:37.750
they're not criminal their young

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:39.619
people young people get from

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:42.121
doctors lawyers engineers could

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.457
be anything we should celebrate

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.958

income children I met this

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:09.421
to be very pride and remember

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:16.028
so I used to work this

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.997
is the deputy mayor -- for

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.331
Richard J. Richard Riordan

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.267
and he used to talk about

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.135
this man all the time and

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:25.070
the work that he's doing and

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.139
-- when he was talking about

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.841
it consider the source yes

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:31.911
-- it was just after the the

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.779
mayor Riordan had fallen on

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.948
his bicycle in France I know

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.716
this abusing her head of

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:39.718
bicycle mishap and that maybe

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.120
not be a bicyclist for the

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:43.589
rest of my life -- but

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.158
a he is -- someone

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:48.360
I note passionately about

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:49.762
what he wants to do and where

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.497
you want to take LA U. S. B.

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:53.966
-- and especially since I have

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.901
two children that teach Cannella

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:58.370
UST -- at the high school

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.706
level I wish them much success

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.708
because with his success both

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:04.877
my children success as teachers

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:07.479
in math and biology --

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:10.082
and I think that makes the whole

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.517
system a lot better and with

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:14.186
that to pretend

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.722
thank you and I just it's

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:18.090
my privilege to be here not

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:20.392
only serving in this role -- but

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.261
it's my privilege of Mr assembly

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:23.495
member to work alongside you on

00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:25.197
this initiative thank you for

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.833
years of commitment to this

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:31.070
-- it's fitting that were here

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.772
at Fremont because

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.507
if we had been here not so

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:36.809
many years ago at Fremont

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:39.278
twenty percent of the kids

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:41.814
were be graduates today

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.948
will celebrate about eighty

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:45.384
percent of graduating if

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:46.919
we'd been here not so many years

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:50.055
ago we treated our students

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:53.192
as a challenger as a problem

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:55.561
almost as criminals -- now

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:57.863
we treat them -- each as

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.832
individuals and provide them

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:01.300
with the opportunity to succeed

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.836
because we've got a bunch of

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:05.004
schools in Los Angeles I'm

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.338
have almost fourteen hundred

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:07.773
schools we serve the needs

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.741
of seven hundred thousand

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:11.510
students and we know there

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:12.745
is opportunity in everyone of

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.113
those seats Calvet everyone

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:15.514
of those seats but unfortunate

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:16.815
opportunity insults work

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:19.518
like this -- that we think

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.153
will help make sure there

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.489
is not only talented but

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:25.257
opportunity in everyone of those

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.592
seats so it's my privilege to

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:28.727
be here -- today a free mind you

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:30.062
would see wraparound services

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:31.630
for counseling clinical care

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:34.300
restorative justice -- and

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.734
dramatically improve community

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:38.070
engagement that's a start our

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.104
students are staying with us

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.340
for helping them graduate we

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:43.075
still have a ways to go to

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:44.276
make sure that they're each

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.744
realizing their full potential

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.247
so just let me share a

00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:49.148
few of the things that we

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.884
are working on -- because

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:54.186
we could spend days and weeks

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:55.087
but I'm just gonna give a few

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:57.556
highlights -- so since two

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.158
thousand thirteen what we've

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.959
been trying to do is reduce

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:03.996
suspensions keep students

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:05.764
with us given the chance to

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.900
learn -- and we led the way

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:09.702
with willful defiance and

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.170
restorative justice practices

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.671
so within a decade ago our

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.106
students miss sixty thousand

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:16.809
days -- to suspension this past

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.444
year less than four thousand

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.747
in addition state leaders led

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.116
by the assembly member and

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:26.485
others agreed earlier this

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.721
month to an act into law to

00:16:28.787 --> 00:16:29.988
strengthen the policies to

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.057
protect especially our youngest

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:33.492
learners from suspensions

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.094
related to will for the five

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.095
thank you for your leadership on

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.996
that that is making a difference

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.199
are the next piece of our

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.767
work and I think I see in the

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.303
audience a few members of our --

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.873
-- task force we set up a task

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.408
force was here when the folks

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:50.342
at the bunch center really

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.276
brought some information or

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:52.878
attention that was really

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.247
troubling -- there almost

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:57.750
twenty drug and alcohol related

00:16:57.816 --> 00:17:00.619
infractions on a list that

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.054
in the past students would be

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.590
arrested so permitted

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.525
mark on the record for obvious

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:08.694
see an issue work counseling a

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.230
diversion -- and more support

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:13.031
is needed so we put together

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:15.100
task force our colleague from

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.168
the bunch center the brotherhood

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:18.003
crusade suits and solidarity

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.905
and the social justice learning

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.240
instead we spent the past six

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.175
months developing a set of

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.344
strategies to reduce the arrests

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.012
and citations of students under

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.614
fourteen in particular African

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.482
American students who are over

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.484
represented in that where we

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.787
can provide counseling support

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.922
-- and give those students an

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.157
opportunity learn from what is

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:40.392
a mistake but just a mistake

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:41.727
as a young person shouldn't

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:44.496
more the record for life --

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.432
Esther assembly member we will

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:48.700
be coming to you we like to

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.836
-- we will intend to apply for

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.372
you three investment fund -- for

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.808
additional support -- I know

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:56.875
I can kind of your support

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:57.876
we need to make sure the rest

00:17:57.943 --> 00:17:58.911
of your colleagues understand

00:17:58.977 --> 00:17:59.878
the importance of this work

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:02.147
because these are just numbers

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.682
on a page is not just dollars

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.317
but each of these investments

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.386
represents the chance for --

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:08.854
young person have a better

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:09.988
life so we appreciate your

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:12.424
support on that -- the second

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.059
if I brought in the lands

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.195
of one of the things that we

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.596
see here today if we took a

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:19.164
tour campus you'd see that

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:20.466
all of the needs of our

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.901
students are not being met --

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:25.003
and we have a big challenge

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.238
in public education on the

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.540
issue of adequacy well

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.576
just put in simplest terms

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:32.678
if we were sitting at the

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:34.246
high school in New York

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.949
the investment any student

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:37.850
would be about twenty nine

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:40.118
thousand dollars a year two

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:41.186
nine thousand dollars a year

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.188
we're sitting at a high school

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.090
here in Los Angeles and our

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:46.859
funding is only about sixteen

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:47.960
thousand dollars a year

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:51.396
as a high school math problem

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.664
twenty nine thousand minus

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:53.999
sixteen thousand twenty nine

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:55.067
minus sixteen I think that

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:57.069
second or third grade and it's

00:18:57.135 --> 00:18:59.638
elementary and our great

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:01.807
challenge or opportunity if we

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.342
choose to look at appropriately

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:04.910
is how do we all come together

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.144
and make sure schools are

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.546
adequately funded because

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.081
adequate funding allows us

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:10.616
to pay people working schools

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:13.051
properly and fairly it allows

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.119
us to make sure that we have

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:15.320
smaller class sizes that we

00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:16.488
have the wraparound supports

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:18.123
that are needed that we have

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.359
all of the a to G. support

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:22.528
an AP classes and beyond that

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:24.463
our students need and deserve

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.031
but the issue of adequacy is

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:26.965
something we as a community

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:28.367
have to address and if we don't

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:30.135
address it we're going to be

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:32.204
left with big opportunities

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.206
that we cancer because we know

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.742
what it takes we know

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:37.910
that additional investment

00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:40.012
will pay enormous dividends

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:40.946
not just to the students

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:41.780
that were investing by the

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:42.948
community as a whole so would

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.316
appreciate your support on that

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.953
are the work doesn't end today

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.389
-- but you have our pledge our

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.524
commitment as a school district

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:53.825
with leaders like Mike for

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:55.494
Meryl our fearless principal

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.296

00:19:58.664 --> 00:19:59.631
make sure that we build on the

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.867
success that we're having -- the

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.269
increase graduation rates -- to

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:06.038
make sure that each student has

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:07.139
a chance to succeed in school

00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:08.807
life thank you thank you and

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.442

taking time out of your day

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:12.978
to come here this is really

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.846
important and -- and I have

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.749
been Askin I don't know how

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:19.117
those leader run through your

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:22.054
office I have a bill --

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:24.756
you mention at risk I have a

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:27.459
bill to change the term at risk

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.528
and take it out it occasion code

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.430
other penal code call our young

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:33.799
people have problems because

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:36.234
and not dwell on what problems

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.669
they had poured but look at

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.172
them as as you said what big

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:42.074
ultimately can be press and is

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.675
on the governor's desk right now

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:46.144
so of any kind of make a

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:48.280
call for the letter anything

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:49.548
you know how he'll have of my

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:50.616
letter of support before the

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:52.484
day's out Sir thank you thank

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:54.519
you a because I think what we're

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.221
collaborating on and working

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:58.357
on is to think of every student

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.425
and their fullest opportunity --

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:01.893
that growth mindset no deficit

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.295
mindset so as we think of each

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:05.464
student are opportunity I love

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.566
the way you phrased it -- these

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.433
are not students who are at

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.801
risk their opportunity and it's

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:11.069
our job to make sure they have

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.671
the full opportunity and then

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:13.805
the other thing is probably

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.708
hopefully I'm able to get

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.777
monies for pop sixty four to

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:20.145
build these health centers like

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.080
the one you have read Ana so

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:23.382
we can collaborate with your

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.250
ministration on what is the best

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:26.518
way to distribute that money

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.886
because I feel that we could

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:29.454
be we're going to get the money

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.958
one of the things that -- since

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.860
we're broker just IBM relation

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:38.096
-- the school as the center

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:39.698
of the community is the

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.333
centerpiece of a lot of our work

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.468
this year because Los Angeles

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:45.170
unified serve students over some

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:46.938
her square miles very different

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:47.939
communities very different

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:50.308
needs -- and so actually --

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:51.643
Mr Romero and his team are

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.978
leading one of our efforts

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.947
in the south where Fremont

00:21:56.882 --> 00:21:59.317
is to make sure that we are

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:01.086
doing everything we can to

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.354
restore the school as that

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:04.156
center the community we think

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:05.524
that a feeder pattern the

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.358
community whether it's an

00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:07.392
elementary school to middle

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.528
school to high school of

00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:11.229
the offering of services to

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:12.364
children in the community and

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.399
their families -- and wellness

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:15.634
services are important part

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.436
of that -- so we'd love to

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.037
work with you on that because

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.306
the coherence we can do around

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:22.774
that to make sure the services

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.810
are not disjointed there's a

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:26.144
reason to provide service to

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:27.579
the school children and families

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.681
are here every day -- so the

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:31.249
state coming along with funding

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:32.484
is fantastic we need to bring

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:33.685
our county partners into it

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.287
-- because they have a certain

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:36.321
different stream of funding to

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:38.657
actually staff and I don't miss

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:40.625
as good here who runs our mental

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:42.027
health support and services

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:43.361
will talk if she is not already

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:44.930
about that but I think if we

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.131
can think of the school as the

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.533
center for everything we can

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.135
to bring the community back in

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.636
and provide that support there

00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:52.537

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:54.439
that thank you thank you at I

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:56.208
do believe it will happen and

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:57.409
not to put any more pressure on

00:22:57.476 --> 00:23:00.545
Fremont when I'm in the capital

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.347
when I'm in Sacramento when I

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:04.216

being the example of what I want

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:12.457
the future of education to be

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:13.458
when it comes to mental health

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.494

campus of Fremont high school

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:48.139
well my clinics started from

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:49.774
a small group of UCLA students

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:50.709
responding to the health

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.344
disparities in south LA up to

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.912
said after the nineteen ninety

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:55.880

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.415
seven years later organizational

00:26:57.482 --> 00:26:58.717
heart is in the same place

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.752
we know how special it is to

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:02.020
have a space that houses the

00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:04.589
greenhouse a community garden a

while sharing the campus with a

00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:13.031
high school in other community

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:15.133
partners we're also fortunate to

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.335
be hosting twice a month if free

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:18.903

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.509
with partnership with LA food

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:27.112
forward despite all the amazing

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.513
resources we have we want to

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.181
do more to affect injustice

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:32.017
injustice is our community faces

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.185
we are honored here to speak

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:35.754
on behalf of our community and

the team of sixty staff members

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:39.457
that make up in addition to our

00:27:39.524 --> 00:27:40.458
stern health leaders program

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:42.394
it'll McKinney clinic at the

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.162
core of our work every month at

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:45.697
the view on campus is a need to

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:47.399
provide pathways for students

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:49.300
to be successful in mind body

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.469
and overall health a body of

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:52.871
research indicates that Los

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.672
class time due to suspension

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:56.508
expulsion and elimination

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:58.276
results in early involvement

00:27:58.343 --> 00:27:59.744
with the juvenile justice system

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:01.413
we cannot look at the school to

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:02.981
prison pipeline without creating

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:04.315
a framework of alternative

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:05.617
models of justice in our

00:28:05.683 --> 00:28:07.585
schools and restorative justice

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:09.187
practices at the core of this

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:11.156
alternative framework according

role of comedian governments

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:32.444
the role of comedian government

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.711
cannot be stressed enough and

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:35.080
as a healthcare organization

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:36.281
serving the campus of Fremont

00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:37.949
high school I'd like to focus

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:38.883
some remarks on what we're

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.151
doing to engage at a community

level the entire Fremont high

of black and brown students all

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:46.724
of whom have been impacted in

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:48.259
some way by the socio economic

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:49.828
disparities that exist in south

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.696
LA the student health leaders

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:53.498
program of the mckinny clinic

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.533
was created to reflects the

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.535
student body giving students

00:28:57.602 --> 00:28:58.970
the power to tackle campus

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:00.305
and community issues affecting

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:01.873
health the criminal justice

inequities amongst others each

00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:07.245
cohort of students as part to

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:08.746
advocate for themselves and

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.315
issues that affect them the most

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:12.083
teaching their peers to do the

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.786
same in the process these topics

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.254
usually merge general health

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.490
race social justice issues in

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:20.091
our campus and community events

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.593
and partnerships of school clubs

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:22.894

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:24.195

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.731
south central LA is comprised

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.166
of about fifty four thousand

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:30.268
you under eighteen forty one

six percent of this county has

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:36.674
a bachelor's degree with just

school students graduating that

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:41.679
alone is enough to inspire us

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.882
to do more especially to the

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.049
empowerment of students who

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.985
are at opportunity and -- I

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.086
really appreciate the assembly

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.187
member going in that direction

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.288
of changing language because

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:52.390
language is important the

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.608
that south central has some

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:11.709
of the highest rates of felony

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:13.077
arrest and state confinement

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:14.612

00:30:24.255 --> 00:30:25.757
and family and community members

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:27.325
have have a higher likelihood

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.327
of becoming a cycle of becoming

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:30.728
part of a cycle that screw

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:33.331
explosion criminalization in

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:37.535
staff began considering ways

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:39.504
to deepen our social justice

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.339
impact to our programs with

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:42.273
the development of a stand

addressing the social justice

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:48.213
issues our students face and

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:49.447
has been able to align their

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:51.516
goals more clearly becoming more

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.151
attended of ways of merging our

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:54.919
clinical educational committee

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.387
partnerships in serving the

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:58.256
community we implemented a

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.124
plan to increase support of the

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.492
feeder elementary and middle

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.493

to sixteen students this year

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:08.132
virtually started off with

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:09.500
five students this year we are

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:11.436
going to sixteen students with

00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.271
hopes expand reach to even more

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:14.505
students in the years to come

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:16.140
this work continues as part

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.542
of our trauma and community

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:19.377
informed care which is why we

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:21.045
recently re branded giving the

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.247
students side of the clinic

00:31:22.313 --> 00:31:24.015
its own name the -- much teen

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:25.750
clinic so students would have

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:27.151
a greater sense of ownership

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:28.486
of the clinics seeing as a

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.154
space that is more there's

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:31.789
than anyone else's this didn't

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:32.790
help leaders are especially

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.092
excited because they help

00:31:34.158 --> 00:31:35.660
designing new outreach materials

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.861
including a new logo which

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.196
they now Pat probably were on

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:40.798
campus the work we do as health

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.467
practitioners cannot be done

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:43.601
without the strong partnership

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:44.902
in cloud of collaborative

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:47.105
efforts alongside with LAUSD

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.806
when Ellie is the adopted the

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:50.308
discipline foundation policy in

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:51.976
two thousand seven the district

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:53.278
stated goal was to establish

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:54.712
a framework for developing

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:56.147
refining and implementing a

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:57.849
culture of discipline conducive

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:59.651
to learning the school wide

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:01.085
positive behavior interventions

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.553
support framework provides a

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.921
systematic an evidence based

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:05.657
approach for improving school

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:07.892
relationships student behavior

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:09.661
and learning outcomes based on

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.029
this new implemented framework

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.397
as we spoke about earlier if

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:13.464
you look at the whole district

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:14.499
suspensions have declined

00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:15.900
dramatically from a high of

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.368
nearly seventy three thousand

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:19.070
in two thousand five it just

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.172
eighty eight thousand and as a

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:22.307
superintendent Peter said about

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:24.208
four thousand recently there's

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:25.310
still much more work to be

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:26.577
done and in tandem with these

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.146
restorative justice practices

00:32:28.212 --> 00:32:29.947
on campus the path for can

00:32:30.014 --> 00:32:32.350
truly be transformative the

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:33.651
on campus principal at school

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:41.946
good morning

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:44.682
in my thirty years of the

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:45.883
school social worker I

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:46.784
have learned that being

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.252
compassionate and caring does

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:50.154
not require additional funding

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.723
yep policies and funding

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.358
are critical and necessary

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:55.593
to breaking the pathway of

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.328
cars serrations psychiatric

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.130
hospitalizations and health

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:01.098
emergencies as you have

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:03.134
just heard LA unified has

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.836
invested for many years

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:06.571
towards the trajectory of

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.673
wellness prevention and early

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:10.341
intervention yet there's a lot

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:11.976
more that we can do towards

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:14.111
that while on this road an

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:15.646
important way to begin is by

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.248
building the capacity of all

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:19.383
adults to know why and how they

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.986
can support resiliency adults

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:23.588
parents care givers in the

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:25.256
school community play a pivotal

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:26.958
role in promoting student

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:29.093
outcome with proper funding and

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.828
resources we can educate all

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:32.697
school stakeholders about the

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:35.666
science and the impact of trauma

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.201
on talk to trial development

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:39.237
learn about systemic change

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:40.805
and opportunities to become

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:42.240
from a resilient and form

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:44.542
schools such as we are here at

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:47.178
Fremont high school to build

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:49.247
on individual community assets

00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:51.949
despite risk factors or a will

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:54.819
now -- do -- as as which

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.053
thank you very much for that

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:57.922
and how each adult plays a

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.457
role by teaching our children

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:01.025
every day regardless of their

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.461
age social emotional skills

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.730
that are needed empathy anger

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:07.698
management problem solving goal

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:10.568
setting and so they can gain

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:12.370
tools and strategies to address

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:15.006
adversities the grief and many

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:16.374
of the trauma triggers the

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.409
experience for students to learn

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.777
that the can counseling and

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.612
mental health support throughout

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:23.814
their lives spent is healthy and

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.750
right for adults to build the

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.585
capacity to understand what it

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.754
means to be regulated so that

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.589
they can be call regulating

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.991
their children and also know

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.660
when children are at risk

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.194
and need additional support

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:38.729
when them they demonstrate

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.398
behaviors that may be harmful to

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.900
themselves harmful to others or

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.269
to stop students and adults were

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:47.872
introductory towards violence if

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.740
left untreated or a monitored or

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.776
services lack we will continue

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:53.377
to experience incidents that

00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:55.346
may lead to tragedies on campus

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:56.881
or have to prepare for active

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:59.450
shooters or tertiary services

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:01.752
that we can prevent this is why

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:03.354
I am so proud to represent LA

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:05.756

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:07.425
what is working what we could

00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:09.594
expand on and we can build upon

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.662
we need to fortify and build

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.631
upon our current efforts we call

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.399

Fremont and many of other high

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:23.507
schools to continue to fund

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:25.476
academic enrichment programs

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.211

personnel some of the work

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.503
we do we do with partnerships

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.639
internal and external and we

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.607
focus on the whole child and

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:57.942
when we look at data we know

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.977
that our children are not all

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:02.580
right we have over nine hundred

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:03.881
diabetic students across the

average are an additional five

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.222
or so the numbers keep growing

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:12.857
we have twenty one thousand

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:15.059
students who have asthma

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.128

six percent of the students

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.605
did not pass this screening

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.173
and we have been able to hand

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.175
out over twenty seven thousand

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:32.977
glasses because they needed

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:35.613
them when we joint partnerships

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.981
with our dental partners that's

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.082

gonna have a clinic soon let

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:42.086
that last year we served over

two thousand three hundred

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.756

thousand or more procedures

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:51.829
we first began to screen a look

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:53.230
at the impact of trauma and

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:54.598
our students twenty years ago

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.701
with partners at UCLA and ran

00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:58.636
in our department of school

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.638
mental health we have come

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:02.139
a long way but we're still

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:03.841
yet in the infancy stages of

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:05.409
doing trauma informed work

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.378
I'm proud to highlight some

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:08.713
of our current practices and

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:11.549
lessons learned last year

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.451
we educated and build the

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:15.786
capacity of all students as a

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:18.456
priority implementing AB twenty

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.758
two forty six which is enacted

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:22.226
in California it required

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:24.628
all school districts to train

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:27.331
and and teach our teachers

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.332
seven through twelve quite

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:30.735
a suicide prevention LAUSD

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.703
revised its policy to include

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.839
all employees certificated

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.507
classified administrators

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.609
basically anybody who works

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.711
with children is required

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:42.313
to learn to be a protective

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.448
factor by being trauma informed

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:46.217
ninety three percent of our

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:47.785
sixty five thousand employees

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.153
completed the training last

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.521
year and we're taking that

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:51.989
training again this year

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.858
we've also developer training

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:56.127
for school support staff are

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:57.728
without nearly five hundred

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:59.096
psychiatric social workers

00:39:59.163 --> 00:40:00.564
and counselors who are trying

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:02.566
to assess triage and develop

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.468
safety plants across elementary

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:06.270
middle and high schools we

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.239
hope to help destructive of

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:10.307
the pathway of self harm self

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:12.243
injurious behavior and that

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:14.545
way we can just -- and the

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:15.579
trajectory towards school

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.081
violence or violent threats to

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:19.416
school community in response

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:21.018
to the aftermath of parkland

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.920
Florida beginning in July twenty

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:25.089
eighteen we also launched a

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:26.624
dedicated partnership with

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.626
school police department student

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.060
health and Human Services

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.529
we teamed up mental health

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.464
practitioners and school police

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:35.633
officers to respond to self

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:37.168
injurious behavior or threat

00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:39.403
to others these teams took

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.738
over eighteen hundred fifty

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:42.239
called the watch commander's

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:44.041
office and LA school police

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:47.111
once those calls were --

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.380
are activated they work

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:52.216
triage and assessed for self

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:54.685
just -- -- harm to self or

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:57.221
or harm to others provided

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.356
technical support and assistance

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:00.891
-- to school sites with right

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.928
assessment and risk and what

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:05.896
ended up happening is that

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.198
fifty three percent of the

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:08.766
students were assessed on

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.001
campuses and out of those twenty

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:12.369
five percent of the students

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.338
were hospitalized we really

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:16.507
tried to stop our children

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:17.842
from going to psychiatric

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.376
hold which seems to be the

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.178
the route that we were doing

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:24.415
before an out of those cases

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:26.350
we continue to do intensive

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.018
case management to ensure that

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.887
children get the right services

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.856
the right district an external

00:41:31.922 --> 00:41:34.592
partnerships every month in LA

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:37.394
unified we have -- we convene

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.029
what we call the LA chart the

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:40.497
lawcenter threat assessment

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:42.833
resource -- response partners

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.803
it involves school police LAPD

services the city attorney and

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:52.643
other partners we look at risk

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.112
factors that cases and we review

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:58.115
students or any rest to develop

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.817
develop a collaborative action

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:02.019
plan and support to address

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:03.487
any critical incident our

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.222
students may be experiencing

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:07.391
and mitigate threats and that

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:09.159
way we can provide services

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:11.095
and not wait until a tragedy

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.898
occurs this year all schools

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:15.499
will be mandated to receive a

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:17.034
trauma informed professional

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:18.669
development we're also

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:20.437
developing a micro credential

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:23.207
for teachers we have done

00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:25.075
universal screenings we started

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.243
with a lot of individual

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.912
therapy and group therapy and

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.513
we've moved into classrooms

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:32.082
we looked at eighteen thousand

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.450
students and about a quarter

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:34.451
of our students screened

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:35.719
at high risk for traumatic

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.922
stress another twenty percent

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:40.324
screen for moderate risk what

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:41.759
we do targeted screening in

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.127
our clinics in our schools

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:44.561
with parental consent more

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:45.629
than eighty percent of our

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:47.164
student report students

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.966
report exposure to three or

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:51.402
more stressful events drama

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:53.237
is prevalent in their lives

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:55.439
half of our students screen

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:58.142
positive for PTSD twenty

00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:00.210
five percent of our students

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:02.346
experience depression and twenty

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.848
five percent also our screen

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:07.451
positive for anxiety twenty five

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:08.986
percent of all those students

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:11.522
also report using substances

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.359
so we are help build up on

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:17.061
individual and group therapy

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.495
and we are now doing class

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:19.830
interventions and whole

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.532
world a great approaches and

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.667
school wide -- activities

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:26.603
LAUSD operates its own mental

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.172
health and health clinics and

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:30.007
wellness centers as well as

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:31.909
partnering with FQHCs like

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:33.444
the one we do here at Fremont

00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:36.413
and as I mentioned earlier when

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.282
children receive services at

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:39.917
school sixty percent of them

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:42.019
finish services versus when

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:43.988
we refer out only ten percent

00:43:44.054 --> 00:43:45.189
of our children finished

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.658
services we have children with

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:49.893
comorbidity issues that means

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.495
that you can have diabetes

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:53.630
possibly also have asthma

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:55.532
but also experience home in

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.801
security or homelessness or

00:43:57.868 --> 00:43:59.903
have been in a foster home and

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.305
have had multiple traumatic

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:04.274
experiences as you now that

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:05.976
leads for a child to have

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.745
difficulty learning and taking

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.114
on full academic potential

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.149
we need funded policies

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:14.118
necessary to pro provide

00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:16.086
support to the whole child to

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.322
prevent and intervene early

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.258
our focus is has been and school

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.027
culture and climate physical

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:25.229
and emotional safety we plan to

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:26.530
increase the number of schools

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:27.798
that are currently implementing

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.533
trauma inform interventions and

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.869
practices many have began to

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:34.838
use meditation and mindfulness

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:37.474
and some schools have also --

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.742
been trained in transit and --

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:41.345
meditation we will continue

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.679
to refuse classrooms with

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:43.947
social emotional and trauma

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:46.250
informed curriculum as they

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:47.651
take on their instructional

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:50.020
methods and we have now also

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:52.056
began to have staff and student

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:53.357
wellness rooms where they can

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:56.226
go and have a break we truly

00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:57.995
are facing a fork in the road

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.463
either we continue to find

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.331
pathology children needing to

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:02.866
be hospitalized for psychiatric

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:05.035
crises incarcerating are you

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:07.438
youth in juvenile hall or

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:08.605
having our children removed

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:10.407
from their families or take

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.276
another road towards wellness

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:14.812
this work depends on investments

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.246
of funding and policies to

00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:17.748
protect school communities they

00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:19.450
do services cannot depend on

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:22.086
limited Kern -- school

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:23.821
district general fund or school

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:25.689
district grants or philanthropy

00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:28.325
we need to take on this

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.527
opportunity to really find

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:32.563
pathways and link learning so

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:34.565
our children I mentioned also

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:35.999
earlier we have a shortage of

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.968
school nurses of social workers

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:39.403
there's nothing better than the

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.271
opportunity to raise our own

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:43.607
-- social workers in north and

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:45.309
school nurses and staff from our

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.011
communities so we look forward

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:49.713
to supporting your efforts to

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.648
really -- be preventative in

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:53.150
early inner intervention so that

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.718
prison pipeline doesn't need

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.687
to exist we have way too many

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.222
other things to do and we are

00:45:58.288 --> 00:45:59.590
ready to implement them thank

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.325
you thank you you mentioned

00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:02.860
trauma can you just give real

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.595
quick the top two trumpeted

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:06.096
domestic violence bullying

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.965
violence industry what are the

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:09.900
well that's interesting and

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.536
poverty well poverty for sure

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.238
our eighties eighty six percent

00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:15.539
or above eighty percent of our

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.274
children arm free and reduced

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:19.543
lunch -- when we talk about

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.812
drama what are screening tools

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:23.280
are not clinical as they can

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:24.882
do in the clinic it was what we

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.683
ask is have they been hit kicked

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.452
or punched that they witnessed

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:30.187
community violence and that the

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:31.822
prevalence one of the ones that

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.190
is increasing I just want to

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:35.659
highlight is car accidents so

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.828
please everybody be very safe

as at promise legislators

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:27.010

be shared with them as well

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.447
because they do have promise

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.149
and it's our responsibility to

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:33.817

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.721

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.890
in our community I also want

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.530
an absolutely beautiful school

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:50.634
when I drove around I didn't

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.102
know what was an unassigned day

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:53.470
and I thought wow everybody's in

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:56.440
class there's no one out there

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:58.675

the sign day but thank you my

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.279
name is our total there's some

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:03.780
the chief academic officer

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:05.215
with the LA county office of

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:07.017
education I'm here representing

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:08.819
superintendent Deborah Eduardo

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.654
couldn't be here today but

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:12.422
I also brought with me Susan

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:14.825
Chait is who works -- so much

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.693
around social emotional learning

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.862
in health services at lake --

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:20.931
just briefly the Los Angeles

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:22.799
county office of education

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:25.636
covers the area from Lancaster

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:28.005
and Palmdale to Pomona to the

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:30.274
mountains to the ocean it's

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.643
about one point five million

00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:34.778
K. twelve students and part

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:37.147
of our -- goal in our promises

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:38.248
to make sure that we work with

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:40.350
all eighty school districts to

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.451
make sure that they have the

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:43.553
tools they need to be successful

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.554
so that's kind of what we're

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:46.490
looking at an equity an axis

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:48.725
is ki¿m paramount the two words

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:51.862
prison and education or school

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:53.430
to prison bills are two words

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:55.632
that should never ever be used

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:57.501
in the same sentence and I think

00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:59.970
our goal here today is to Iraqi

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:01.738
that and to never have those

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:03.974
two words a used in combination

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.347
I think our principal knows

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:12.683
that her primary job is

00:49:12.749 --> 00:49:14.985
to support our teachers

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.453
because if you support our

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.322
teachers and they do their job

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:20.524
effectively and efficiently and

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.059
I know that there are barriers

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:23.860
to academic success and that's

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:25.429
where the the health and mental

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.130
health component come into it

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:28.732
we all need to work together

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.033
no one's going to do it by

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.868
themselves no teacher can do

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:33.437
it by themselves no principle

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.605
no superintendent no social

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:37.040
worker we all need to bind

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:38.508
together and say what's best

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.177
for the community and for our

00:49:40.243 --> 00:49:41.511
parents that are sitting right

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:43.747
there we work for you and we

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:45.382
need to do a better job at

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.217
working well together and that's

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.552
really what this panel is all

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.554
about saying that we need to

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.856
to join arms and support you

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.624
in your work as we move forward

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:55.859
I wanted you to know that the

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:58.662
county has -- an incredible

00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.863
relationship right now with

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.331
the county mental health county

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:02.733

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:16.847
those centers as well so we're

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:18.849
hoping to make some inroads --

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:20.751

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:22.652

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.366
things the LA county has to

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:38.568
offer and the partnerships in

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:39.536

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:46.576

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.678
school a hub for that community

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:50.847
as well and later has looked at

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.649
two initiatives in particular

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:53.850
looking at the trauma and

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:38.081
at this year we are expanding

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:39.749

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:42.719
with the California department

support students as well in this

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:53.496
is part of the cal stop which

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:55.298
looks at providing free training

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.801
for any schools any districts

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:58.969
on youth mental health for

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:00.870
state and also working through

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.939
sandy hook promise to provide

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.507
school prevention our school

violence prevention models and

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:07.410
training for them and so we

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:08.578
have been an active part of

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:10.647
that and will be expanding those

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:12.515
services through our schools and

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.351
districts this school year or

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.920
also expanding and incorporating

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:18.688
into lego being able to provide

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:20.423
restorative practices training

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.425
for our schools of the bacon

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.194
and incorporate those practices

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.329
into their school site we also

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.598
have -- through our center for

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:30.033
distance online learning we

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.368
have something called support

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:33.403
to otherwise known as suicide

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.105
prevention ongoing resilience

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:36.940
trainee we also have to deal

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.608
which is a teaching education

00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:40.310
through the arts for learning

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.345
and so again looking at how do

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:44.047
we support that social emotional

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:46.016
learning for students how do we

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:47.317
make that environment so that

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.753
the classroom the campus itself

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.888
is a supportive environment and

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.089
recognize they were not looking

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:54.891
to push you out of school we're

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.259
looking at what can we do to

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.595
put to support you and keep you

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.597
in school and recognizing any

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:02.298
of the challenges and how do we

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.667
train those and opportunities

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:05.502
for students and so we're very

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:07.070
excited about all the work that

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.938
we're doing and again anyone who

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:10.674
wants to reach out and look at

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:13.243
-- are accessing the Ste the

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:15.078
services at Los Angeles county

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.247
office of education but yes it

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:18.748
is important that our students

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.984
support staff again it's nice

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.118
to be see that that's been a

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:23.486
focus that it's not just in

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:24.921
the classroom in the academics

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.589
but how do we support again

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.825
the whole child -- the services

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.160
that they need including not

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.761
only their physical well being

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:33.396
but there mental well being

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:34.698
and making this particular

00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:36.099
with the mental well being is

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.134
decreasing the stigma so that

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:40.603
it's it's okay to get support

00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:42.105
it's okay to keep yourself

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:44.441
healthy physically and mentally

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:46.476
and so again we thank you for

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.945
-- again the support and looking

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.146
at how do we increase our

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:52.148
capacity as well our staffing

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.783

00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:07.357
or will first then your

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:09.025
family member Jones Sawyer

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:11.895
-- for this opportunity in

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.496
addition to the explicit threats

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:14.464
against their communities

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:15.899
immigrants and refugees are

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:17.300
often unknowingly subjected

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.868
to external pressures that

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:20.403
drastically impact the outcome

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.238
of their lives this opportunity

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:23.907
to examine environment

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:25.608
examine environmental factors

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:27.310
affecting the state's immigrant

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:28.945
communities is critical to

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.213
reducing California school to

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.148
prison pipeline ensuring that

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:33.449
this population is part of

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:36.152
California success it should

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:37.720
come as no surprise to the

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:40.123
members of the committee to

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.958
the assembly member and to the

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.227
community that the current

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:45.295
federal ministration has

00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:47.564
major priority to foster anti

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.165
immigrant fervor in America

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:51.367
features such as the department

00:57:51.434 --> 00:57:53.336
of homeland security's public

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:54.904
charge rule change set to go

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.873
into effect on October fifteenth

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:58.541
we'll weaponized safety net

00:57:58.608 --> 00:58:00.009
programs for immigrants looking

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:02.145
to enter into the country or

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:03.546
apply for status change the

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:05.448
permanent residency county

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.016
social service programs already

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.918
reporting a high rate of dissing

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:11.120
Roman for programs that keep

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:12.288
immigrants and their families

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:14.157
fed help the in house in

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:15.825
this policy change one which

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:17.560
California is suing to prevent

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:19.896
-- is also having a chilling

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:21.497
effect that will adversely

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.066
affect generations of school

00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:24.701
children families who will

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:25.835
have to live their lives in

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:28.104
poverty and without access to

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:29.239
the mental and physical health

00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:31.074
care they so desperately need

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:32.575
for this committee hearing

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:33.710
I will speak to the factors

00:58:33.776 --> 00:58:34.944
that immigrant and refugee

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:36.546
students may be exposed

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:37.447
to that could potentially

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:38.448
affect their performance at

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:40.650
school programs in existing

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:42.085
services that are effective

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:43.753
and specific areas that we

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.054
can improve upon to mitigate

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:46.189
the effect of environmental

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:48.725
factors was the finding cited

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.026
in my remarks can be found

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.461
in the healthy mind for the

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:53.563
future report a collaboration

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:54.998
from the California policy

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:56.466
center and the children's

00:58:56.532 --> 00:58:58.201
partnership that was released

00:58:58.268 --> 00:58:59.869
in two thousand eighteen in

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:01.337
that report immigrant families

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:02.705
interviewed across the state

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:04.807
-- said that they had increased

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.476
levels of fear anxiety and

00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:08.144
uncertainty about their futures

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:09.879
with half of California's

00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:11.147
children having at least one

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.916
immigrant parents and one in

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:14.517
six children having at least one

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:16.853
undocumented parents the fear

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.888
of being detained or deported

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.490
manifests itself to behaviors

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:22.025
of local school district level

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.460
for example Oxnard Union High

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:26.996
School district the former

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.898
parents to provide instructions

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:30.366
for the school on next steps

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:31.401
in the event that the parents

00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:33.770
are deported research suggests

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.171
that this fear keeps families

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.439
from fully participating in

00:59:36.506 --> 00:59:39.175
American society in addition

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.243
to the threats from federal

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.911
officials students and families

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:43.279
must deal with the trauma that

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:44.514
comes from balling at the hands

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.549
of other students immigrant

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.017
youth ages sixteen to twenty

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.686
one have openly acknowledge

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.454
that billion anti immigrant

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:53.022
sentiments have impacted their

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:55.325
daily lives at school immigrants

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:56.559
participating in the study

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:57.627
also said that they felt the

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:59.462
general public seems to be more

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:01.764
emboldened to make racist and

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:04.167
discriminatory remarks since

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.168
the election of president

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:07.570
trump pediatricians expressed

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:08.638
the current environment is

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.306
creating a toxic stressed to

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:11.874
children which will result

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.376
in increased chronic disease

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.244
and mental health disorders

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.080
in adultery and wobbling is

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.214
an issue not exclusive to

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.716
the immigrant community it

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.718
is important to note that

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.353
the fax it will have on our

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.687
community as they may have

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.289
limited English speaking skills

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.024
and limits support on campus

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.559
one of the respondents to the

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.227
survey said pulling is one of

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.029
the roughest experience for a

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.330
lot of students who are newly

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.366
arrived immigrants outside

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.266
of the school environment

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.534
immigration status plays a

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.836
role in family engagement for

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.704
students parents see their own

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.172
immigration status as a barrier

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.674
to the dreams and goals that

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.908
they have for their children

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.577
school officials interviewed

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:48.578
talk about parents being

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.946
disengage from the children's

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:51.881
school activities because of our

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.249
country's current anti immigrant

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.685
climate this level of separation

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:56.986
between parent and school

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:58.521
means students may miss out on

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.857
valuable services such as free

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.525
and reduced lunch applications

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.494
and also result in reduced

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.329
participation in parent teacher

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.364
or parent administrator meetings

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.299
that may be required and now

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.135
comes the good part there

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.137
are examples of existing and

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.938
effective programs and services

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.374
all in for safe schools is a

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:19.976
coalition of statewide partners

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:21.411
that works with the California

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.079
department of education to

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.580
further support children in

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.848
immigrant families on school

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.151
campuses benefits from this

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.619
coalition include distributing

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:31.554
of materials hosting committee

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.089
conversations and having

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.290
trainings on from one form

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.426
curriculum Senate bill fifty

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:37.727
four passed in two thousand

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.328
seventeen the California

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:40.863
values that contains an often

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.765
overlooked sensitive locations

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:43.933
provision that requires

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.735
specific public of locations

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.071
including public schools to

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.839
adopt a model policy that guides

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.441
their response in the face of

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.875
any immigration enforcement

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:55.478
activities the one California

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.013
program which is operated by the

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.314
California department of social

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.050
services went from a one time

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.618
to an ongoing funded program

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.887
passed this past year along with

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:06.789
legal service funding this year

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.324
the state allocated five million

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.992
dollars for two new pilot

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.861
programs one of which allows

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.229
for mental health assessments

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:14.697
and the other which will find

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.132
a navigator program to connect

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.733
immigrants receiving services

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.936
with wraparound services if

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.471
successful this would provide an

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.339
opportunity to begin integrating

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.941
mental health into the state's

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.576
immigrant integration efforts

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.177
and would allow for program

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.178
that could be expanded to

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.813
provide trauma informed care

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.449
the California policy center

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:35.151
has many recommendations for

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:36.419
helping to mitigate the anti

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.187
immigrant environmental effects

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:39.822
the California is currently

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:41.524
facing the limited to three

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.059
for the sake of time and so

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.127
that we can have more talk in

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:47.063
Sacramento one policy first

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.397
we need to strengthen community

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.899
safety to ensure children youth

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.934
and families feel secure and

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:53.669
supported in their communities

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:55.071
this includes state and

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.806
local agency administration

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.441
staff supporting the full

01:02:58.508 --> 01:02:59.976
implementation of Senate bill

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:02.311
fifty four as well as assessing

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.147
steps local health clinics are

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.615
taking to identify existing

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:08.017
service gaps this is even

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.018
more important as immigrant

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.219
communities encounter fear and

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.587
confusion over the public will

01:03:11.654 --> 01:03:14.056
charge change and limit their

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.658
participation public services

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.460
and programs community help

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:18.361
would also mean encouraging

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:19.428
schools to address school

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.564
climate in their local control

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.066
and accountability plan second

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.601
recommendation is to invest in

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:27.537
community based approaches and

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:28.771
a community based workforce

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.273
of support immigrant families

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.108
this includes expanding of the

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.242
mental health services that

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.510
school based health programs can

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:36.245
provide the students a perfect

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.114
example is right here Fremont

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.584
and third we would like to

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.119
improve access coordination

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.554
integration of services

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:45.955
to reduce the barriers for

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.657
immigrant families is means

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:48.858
including schools offering

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.393
say spaces to host communities

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.195
questions on sentiments

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.462
around immigration issues

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:55.565
and encouraging partnerships

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:56.933
with community organizations

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.434
and schools to host know your

01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.969
rights trainings to educate

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.404
the community members on the

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.172
latest public policy changes in

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:05.942
regards to immigration in ending

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.076
it's been twenty five years

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.544
since California voters passed

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.546
the racist and xenophobic prop

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.582
one eight seven since then our

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.317
state has served as the leader

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.319
on immigrant integration and

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.087
inclusion we must continue

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.789
to hold California's up hold

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.390
California's values of equality

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:23.059
in compassion to move our

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.627
country forward during this

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.295
time of uncertainty thank you

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.132
thank you back

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:35.838
assemblymember thank you for

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:38.374
having us -- I do like the app

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.210
promise her you know when

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:42.178
I was doing my graduate

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:44.680
studies earlier at USC I came

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:45.948
across what I was calling in

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.050
the collected population and

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:49.252
and people were saying what

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:50.219
are you talking about I was

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:53.055
like well it's what society

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:55.524
categorizes as getting involved

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:56.692
getting affiliated view

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.996
and as I explored further I

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:02.898
realize once a youth becomes

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.300
in gauge with the criminal

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.936
justice system getting a line

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.137
strengthens by eighty eight

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:10.473
percent based on research those

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:12.074
like are we creating the issue

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.577
so how do we look at front

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.112
and types of strategies and

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:17.613
treatment which you have been

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.881
doing throughout your career

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.584
so now trimming AB promise

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.487
is the step to go there

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:28.457
at risk to the factors

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:30.526
but they are not from a deficit

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.595
understanding right so thank

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:34.864
you for that -- today I will

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.066
be focusing on the impact

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.534
environmental factors have on

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.336
healthy youth development with

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:41.904
the focus specifically on youth

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.806
violence as a primary area of

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:46.409
concern what we continue to

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.144
over look is this whole issue

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.012
of rapid development terrible

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.347
development Weber calling

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:53.649
gentrification and its impact

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.184
on health youth development

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.986
the identified intractable

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.688
problem through all of this

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.123
is what is called violence

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.559
related trauma and its

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.261
relationship to challenges

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.596
faced by urbanized view to

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.231
limit the find violence related

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.967
trauma for you violence related

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:14.170
trauma is any relationship

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.605
this for condition by which an

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:19.308
individual or a group violates

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.210
the physical social and or

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:23.179
psychological integrity of

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:24.747
another person or group so

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.016
it's not strictly physical harm

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.485
the psychological integrity of

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:32.154
another group has more severe

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:34.223
repercussions on our community

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.092
members and we just heard from

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.227
our previous speaker studies

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.628
indicate that there is a twenty

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.764
two percent increase of trauma

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.300
exposure for communities known

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:46.235
as enclaves which we find

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:48.571
in your district go union

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:51.807
what's going on the list goes

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:54.543
on twenty two twenty two percent

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.145
increase of trauma exposure

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:57.947
now that's equated and I hate

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.615
to do this but it's equated

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:00.750
because it's the only other data

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:03.152
that I could compare to troops

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:05.688
doing a tour of duty it's hot

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.656
or higher than a trip doing

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:08.991
a tour of duty in a war torn

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:11.227
country that level trauma exist

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:12.962
in our community in our backyard

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:15.564
where we sit today so

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:19.635
I want to also mention that

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.737
within these impoverished

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:24.106
enclaves there's an escalation

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.008
of fragmented institutions

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.743
economic insecurity lack

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.612
of opportunity amplifying

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:31.447
psychological barriers for its

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.916
community members brown's

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.017
indicates that there is a

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:36.685
high prevalence of violence

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.754
exposure injured by urban youth

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.756
living in impoverished enclaves

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:43.025
whether as victims or witnesses

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.261
studies nationwide also indicate

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:47.797
detrimental impacts on a young

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:49.732
brain due to violence exposure

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.867
again this isn't just physical

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:53.836
harm this is also what we call

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:56.338
structural arm study after

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.207
study indicate that unaddressed

01:07:58.274 --> 01:07:59.742
trauma for youth residing in

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:01.544
disenfranchised communities

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.446
can have detrimental effects on

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.347
youth and families increasing

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.016
the likelihood of violence due

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.484
to stress placed on community

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.486
members it's here where I'm

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.354
going to highlight we need to

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:14.089
look at what types of assessment

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.158
tools were using to capture

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:19.195
this evidence that impacting

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.864
and compromising the integrity

01:08:22.164 --> 01:08:23.966
of our youth development

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.702
foster defines this as drama

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:29.238
Chiu Jean experiences resulting

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.807
in severe psychological distress

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:34.343
applying certain theories such

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.845
as multiple marginality by

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:38.147
Diego V. hill helps is better

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.582
understand the historical and

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.984
structural dynamics of community

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.119
subject to violence when we

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:46.055
apply this framework it reveals

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.756
a strong correlation of urban

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.558
youth engage in violence due to

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:52.495
strain caused by urbanisation

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.864
rapid development were seen here

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.432
in the city and county of Los

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:59.668
Angeles with the gentrification

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:01.670
of communities specifically how

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.105
it's impacting our communities

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.241
of color something to be aware

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.575
and I really feel assembly

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.277
member you could champion the

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.778
effort to really look at how

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.547
this is impacting our youth

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:12.948
and community members which

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.184
were largely overlooking were

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.151
seen it with the increase

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:17.453
of homelessness today

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.690
so Adam bird bird

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:23.225
tell defines this phenomena

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.261
as structural violence he

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:26.629
defined structure violence as

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:29.398
systematic ways in which social

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.100
structures harm or otherwise

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.968
disadvantaged individuals

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.571
such as policing practices

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:37.806
use of zero tolerance and the

01:09:37.873 --> 01:09:40.509
list goes on the on attended

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.077
re triggering of complex

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.213
traumas which is the cumulative

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.815
repetitive traumas experience

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.851
by institutional failures

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.986
intensifies the psychological

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:53.122
wounding of community members

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:54.657
and Abbott documentation that

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:55.691
I could submit to your office

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:58.227
later on this this has also

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:00.095
been framed as synergetic

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.864
trauma so we're going to a

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.933
deeper landed or trauma not

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:06.402
just domestic but how it

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:08.070
actually impacts as from a

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.506
structural lands case in point

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:12.608
I had a youngster come into

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.376
my office and he lives in one

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:15.444
of these areas that are being

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:18.113
gentrified up springs a coffee

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.616
shop no surprise for any was

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:21.850
Mister I'm gonna go in and

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.118
and I'm gonna give it a try

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.521
he goes into this coffee shop

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.090
and he said you know

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.258
what they look at me

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:30.726
as if I was a foreigner

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:34.697
he left still live in

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:37.533
he goes do you understand I

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.168
go for generations back in

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:41.203
this community and they're

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.605
looking at me as a foreign

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.208
there's no coincidence that

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.710
there's up taking graffiti as

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:50.512
well the sign of certain

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.748
fractures to communities in

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:54.216
hell they're still trying to

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:57.152
really show that they're still

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:59.188
part of the community in a very

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:01.156
assertive play that's what I'm

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:03.692
seeing happen this also

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.194
has been framed S. intergenic

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.563
trauma as I said before the

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.764
substance abuse and mental

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.366
health services administration

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.267
stamps of further identifies

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.403
this as historical trauma

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:18.173
Sam ser associate this

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.108
type of trauma with the

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.743
racial and ethnic groups in

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:21.810
the United States who have

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.912
suffered major intergenerational

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.681
losses and assaults on their

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.383
culture and while being

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.820
a study conducted by Yang of

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:33.122
the neural science poverty

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.556
project at the university of

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.991
southern California concludes

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:37.760
that areas subjected to violence

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:39.662
excessive noise que es at home

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.864
pollution mall nutrition abuse

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.932
and parents without jobs can

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.301
had detrimental impacts on a

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:48.837
young bring hi a stocky

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:50.706
also knows how the problems of

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:53.208
housing discrimination unsafe

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:55.544
living environments racism

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.880
and underfunded schools affect

01:11:57.946 --> 01:11:59.348
brain development there's a

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.950
strong correlation study after

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:03.886
study indicates that unaddressed

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.521
trauma for youth residing in

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:07.356
impoverished enclaves whether

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:09.158
due to discriminatory policies

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:11.360
like immigration public charge

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:14.463
migration urbanization

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.432
development gentrification red

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.233
lining and policing practices

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.369
has detrimental effects on

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.638
youth and families manifesting

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.106
itself as under achievement in

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.974
schools high rates of drug use

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.910
abuse dangerous sexual behavior

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.678
gang activity and violence

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.780
exposure that's why are you

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.116
are at risk the environment

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.784
makes them at risk and they

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.352
have so much promise that's

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:39.455
been overshadowed by these

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:42.558
factors the national center

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.059
posttraumatic stress disorder

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.028
indicates that close to forty

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.530
percent let me let me highlight

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:50.699
this forty percent of urban

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.301
youth develop posttraumatic

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:55.370
stress disorder forty percent

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:59.274
why are we up in arms right now

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:01.844
if it was inserted communities

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.212
people would be up in arms

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:06.982
forty percent that's higher

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.451
then a soldier coming

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:10.886
back from a tour of duty

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.855
not to down play with the

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:15.057
printer the forty percent

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:19.228
this there appears to be a

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.996
gap in research specific to

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.498
violence related trauma expose

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.500
report urban youth making this a

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.969
pressing area to explore further

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:29.138
assembly member and we need to

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:32.207
today the state of California

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:34.009
we know the costs ninety

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.310
five thousand two hundred

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:36.712
fifty two thousand dollars to

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.046
incarcerate one juvenile for

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.815
one year between the ages of

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:41.817
seven to eighteen years of age

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:45.721
nationally Acosta roughly an

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.289
estimated four hundred and seven

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:50.025
dollars a day to incarcerate

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.860
when you end up to one

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.295
hundred forty eight thousand

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:55.297
seven and sixty south seven

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.299
dollars per user per year

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:59.168
as opposed to investing

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:00.402
prevention intervention

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:01.970
treatment at Acosta anywhere

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.272
from ten thousand to fifteen

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.706
thousand dollars annually

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:08.143
blueprints for youth development

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:09.745
of behavior health science

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.213
institute shows that incorporate

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.848
in and Bective evidence

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:14.683
based treatment model such

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.618
as multisystem make their pre

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.487
the list goes on which takes a

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:21.290
multifaceted system approach has

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:22.891
a reduction in recidivism rates

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.526
for juveniles from anywhere to

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.495
seventy to seventy five percent

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:29.865
that's roughly and this

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:31.533
also includes a reduction in

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.368
convictions for aggressive

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.504
youth crimes at a cost of seven

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.172
thousand dollars to invest in

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:38.874
of infective treatment model

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.312
financially the smarter

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:45.747
to invest in front end

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:47.082
treatment than to continue

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.284
to do this reactive response

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:52.621
which taxpayers have entered

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:55.791
I'm a big proponent of

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:58.260
the debate youth development

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:00.495
taking what youth you are

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:02.998
framing as youth promise how

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.666
do we get it from thriving

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:06.869
used to floor seen use our

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.670
assessment tools also not

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:11.640
contrary to certain research

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.108
today we can't just look at

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.477
the adverse affects impacting

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.279
our youth we need to look at

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.548
the strength some people call

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.717
resilience basically it's

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:24.152
survival skills and how do we

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:26.154
look at the survival skills

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.457

that information so that we can

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.310
make the big thing about what

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.245
we're trying to do is develop of

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.748
policies legislation removed

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.983
for with and then budget request

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.585

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:02.424
something tangible would be

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.159
great thank you again could you

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:05.594

and now we're for our

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.635
last panel to discuss per

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:16.038
rational -- development

in Oakland San Jose Long Beach

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:21.737
and Fresno and part of why

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.038
I'm here today three lift up

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.106
the work that's happening in

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:26.108
Central Valley -- we know that

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.843
there's a lot of folks in places

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:28.977
like Central Valley there are

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:30.178
struggling but sometimes we

01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:32.047
forget that many of these folks

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:33.548
are people of color immigrants

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:35.517
in the document of folks part

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:36.618
of our work is closing the

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.353
achievement gap -- but we've

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.721
also identify something called

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:41.590
a belief gap which we see the

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.692
product of unequal expectations

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.660
based on race and zip code

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.763
students confirm that teachers

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:49.264
have higher expectations the

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.632
white students and students of

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.734
color for example black students

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.102
we are compatible test scores to

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:55.570
white students were about half

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:56.872
as likely as white students to

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:59.041
place and gifted programs this

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:00.409
gap between what parents and

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:01.443
students of color believe they

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.111
can do and what teachers and

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:04.279
administrators believe they're

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.381
capable of capable of confined

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:07.816
to potential students of color

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.086
-- so you see a graphic up here

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:13.655
on a power point out to be of

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:16.158
speak a bit to that -- a

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:17.859
solution our students identified

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:18.960
to kind of close to billion

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:21.229
gap is to really build trusting

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.564
and empowering relationships

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:23.932
between students and school

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.001
staff most of us agree with

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.669
this we can probably all think

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:29.171
about a teacher or school staff

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:30.806
who made an impact on life

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:32.140
who helped us believe in our

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:34.576
potential unfortunately not all

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:36.078
students have that experience

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:37.879
school climate survey data show

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:39.314
that one in three students in

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:40.949
California could not identify

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:42.918
a single caring adult in school

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:44.686
one of our students and Fresno

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:46.054
has said that they feel teachers

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.322
see then the subject to be

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.291
managed you walk of the school

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:50.425
you see large gates you see

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.194
police cars surveillance cameras

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:53.829
the school has more school

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.363
resource officers in mental

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.265
health counselors in office as

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:58.567
one of the large window panes

01:18:58.633 --> 01:18:59.835
that separate you from the

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.136
people working office like the

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:03.138
ones they have in prison -- I

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.739
also separately from California

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.441
justice also organizer prisoners

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:08.577
in Oregon state penitentiary and

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:09.845
actually a lot more parallels

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:12.481
between how admin teach tree

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.483
students and how the O. three

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.084
prisoners in the penitentiary

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:17.686
for a lot of students the

01:19:17.752 --> 01:19:18.920
only the only time they have

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:20.155
interactions with principles

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.323
in the school administration

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:22.424
is when they're in trouble

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:24.292
and the only interactions

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:25.494
you have leadership in your

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.229
school isn't healthy then your

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:28.463
relationship with your school

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.699
is going to be a healthy our

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.634
campaign are right now we few

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:34.002
relationships are critical for

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:36.104
educational success and social

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.240
emotional development research

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:40.008

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.276
students and staff decrease

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:43.345
students suspensions absences

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:44.579
and drop outs and increase

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.148
graduation rates test was in

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:48.316
school climate relationships are

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:49.651
critical for students of color

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:51.086
who often have less supportive

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:52.554
relationships with teachers

six five education leaders we

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:04.933
found their relationships are

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.368
the key to addressing systemic

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.236
racism in schools and closing

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:09.938
the belief gap students are

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:11.606
not driving this equity focus

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.441
improvement efforts at districts

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.499
on a third reimagine schools

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.367
to transform the institutional

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.769
racism that is inherent in the

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:22.137
fact the amount of education

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:24.472
with the prioritize the social

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:25.940
and emotional development and

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.342
unique needs and interests

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:29.511
of students of color students

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.046
quality preschools where every

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:32.447
single young person feels like

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:33.948
they belong in are safe and

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:36.551
supported to succeed a key

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.653
role state policymakers can play

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.055
in helping us to really create

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:41.256
relationships in a schools

01:22:41.323 --> 01:22:42.424
are through policy in budget

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.958
priorities and investment staff

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:45.927
-- I do one again lift up the

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:48.296
communication initiative and the

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:49.931
school crime initiative that we

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:51.833
have organized run past would

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.635
love to continue to to see more

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:56.638
investment in our two other

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.473
priorities that we want to talk

01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.908
about on that are particularly

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:01.476
relevant in Central Valley

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.111
are bilingual educators and

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:05.947
community schools for bilingual

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.248
teachers it is important

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.583
for students to have healthy

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:09.851
relationships with teachers who

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.419
speak the same language of them

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.987
a lot of students learn about

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:14.389
the ports programs and other

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:15.857
resources to their teachers

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.225
and having a teachers and speak

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:18.560
that same languages you really

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:21.329
opens up of resources California

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:22.397
for justice English learner

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.732
students identify bilingual

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.367
staff is one their main needs

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:26.935
one of our students pointed out

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:29.070
why having a bilingual consular

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.206
is helpful whenever I don't

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.607
understand she talks to me she

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.109
showed me examples to make sure

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.077
everything's okay she asked

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:37.479
how you are doing your classes

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:39.147
will kind of help you need he

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.548
sometimes give me information

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:41.850
about some opportunities that

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.752
I can take he told me about

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:44.953
the summer internship these

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.788
courses about cybersecurity

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.390
and I'm taking it because I'm

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.657
interested in computer science

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:51.526
and computers in general show

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.027
me to get en she's been really

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.397
helpful Central Valley has a

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:56.898
large population of what hockey

in long and can jobs student

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:00.235
when we talk about language

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:01.836
accessible resources we also

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:03.171
need to be investing in binding

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.173
with teachers and Central Valley

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.075
is not alone in this need about

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:08.276
thirty eight percent of K.

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:10.044
twelve students California have

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.446
been or are currently English

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:14.082
learners on the for communities

schools and offices and talk

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.218
about that briefly on there are

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.686
kind of schools who are packed

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:19.888
in these models out there there

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.556
adopting some of these practices

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:23.158
these are public school was

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:24.359

success you community schools

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:30.932
though community schools in the

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.066
could be different depending on

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:33.601
whether at our partners at the

01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:35.003
partnership for future learning

schools is having four pillars

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.442
that first one is integrated

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:42.610
student support recognizing that

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:43.945
students social and emotional

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:44.979
development are linked with

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.948
academic learning some of

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.216
the most common services and

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:49.918
supports a medical dental and

support resources for families

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:56.958
such as parent education classes

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.226
job training and placement

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:00.261

01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:03.264
nutrition programs number two

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.266
expanded in rich learning time

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.001
and opportunities community

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.303
schools provide students with as

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:09.737
much as one third more learning

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:10.972
time in which they experience

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:13.141
arts physical activities mark

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.577
group or individualized academic

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:17.312
support and hands on learning

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:18.546
activities across a range of

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:21.015
subject areas number three

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.817
active in family community

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:24.886
engagement I mean of course

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.187
prioritize meaningful and

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:27.956
ongoing gave me the families and

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.257
community members and establish

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:30.492
the systems structures and

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:31.860
supports the make it happen

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:33.428
from partnering with parents

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:34.996
to develop and promote a vision

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:36.631
for student success offering

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.566
courses activities and services

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.068
for parents in communion

Amer screening structures

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:42.437
and opportunities for shared

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:44.973
leadership and number for

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.875
collaborative collaborative

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.810
leadership practices this bill

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.111
act as the glue that connects

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:52.013
all the other pillars examples

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.248
of this include professional

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.049
learning communities Sybase

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.251
team charged with improving

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.886
school passing passion teaching

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.621
and learning labor management

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:00.889
collaborations and future

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.624
development strategies such

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:04.225
as peer assistance in review

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:06.794
-- as I wrap up I also want to

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:09.030
say we are living in a unique

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:11.032
moment right now in this country

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:13.001
-- where a lot of people are

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.335
experiencing different forms

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:15.603
our passion we are experience

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:16.938
really differently so I think

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:19.307
it is important that we also see

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:21.409
this moment as an opportunity

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:22.777
to really bring people into

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.812
space about education and I

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:25.980
think we have an opportunity

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.982
to be the re invasion what

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:29.217
public education can look

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:31.386
like in the state -- and that

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.954
vision often means a radical

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.355
shift in how we think about

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.990
schools in the people in them

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:37.792
really humanizing our students

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.127
by seeing rations ships as a

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.762
foundation to students of fast

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.730
-- so look forward to building

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:43.898
and putting in work with the

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:44.966
folks in this room to make

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.335
that happen thank you thank you

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:51.539
you know

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:59.480
is it on yeah my

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:00.648
name's in very good now

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:01.683
I'm here representing the

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:02.817
California federation of

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.218
teachers I am also a member

01:27:04.285 --> 01:27:06.120
of United teachers Los Angeles

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:09.991
some banner yeah we're we're

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:11.926
high tech over here when the

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.728
high tech over here you are

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.431
-- it's the Jewish new year

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:17.632
so I want to read a quote by

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.667
Eli Weisel Holocaust survivor

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.502
the opposite of love is not

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:23.304
hate it's an difference the

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:25.173
opposite of art is not ugliness

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:26.975
it's a difference the opposite

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.543
of faith is not heresy it's

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.911
indifference on the opposite

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.446
of life is not death it's in

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.247
difference and I think that

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:34.415
relates to a lot of what we're

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:36.417
talking about in here I'd like

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:38.219
to say thank you to assembly

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:40.121
member Jones Sawyer for hosting

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:42.657
this on the second of four

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:46.027
hearings -- on the school to

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.895
prison pipeline I also want to

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:50.431
say -- we actually should change

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:51.633
that to the school to prison to

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:54.002
deportation pipeline I did

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:55.837
not come up with that so don't

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:58.139
give me credit I was at another

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:00.208
training probably about a year

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:01.976
or two ago and that's very

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:04.579
important -- across California

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:07.181
and -- some of some of our other

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:10.051
states that once our students

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.586
get into prison if they're

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:13.488
not here legally they will

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:15.690
much more easily be deported

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:17.225
so let's just put that in our

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:18.793
lexicon the school to prison to

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.729
deportation pipeline --

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:25.033
somebody mentioned earlier --

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:27.635
the the assembly bill I think

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:29.737
is assembly bill they --

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.707
we are not allowed to suspend

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.308
for willful defiance and it

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.777
brought down our suspensions

01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:37.679
an alley UST by the thousands

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:39.847
or tens of thousands and that's

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:41.249
great but it's it's a false

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:43.351
narrative because we don't

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:45.486
actually have systems in place

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.555
that support our students

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:49.891
of course even if you're not

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:52.593
allowed legally put to suspend

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.695
of course those numbers are

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:55.196
going to drop but that doesn't

01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:57.532
mean the support or the student

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:59.534
behavior has improved so it's

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.835
really a false narrative that

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.136
I would like to get away from

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:04.072
and I supported that legislation

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:05.506
when it came because I don't

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:06.607
think that we should suspend

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:08.409
for willful defiance when the

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:10.545
teachers are in the classrooms

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:12.513
with overcrowded classrooms en

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.182
L. A. U. S. T. in much much of

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:16.451
the state of California there

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.119
really are in a bind when a

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.688
child is cussing and they

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.457
have forty other students

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:24.025
and their their holding that

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.394
class hostage so when we talk

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.162
about the suspension rate has

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:30.698
declined fabulous let's have

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.533
a real narrative and say that

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.168
that has not brought on the

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:35.403
support that we need for our

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.905
students I'm glad also that

01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:39.307
that superintendent beauty

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:41.642
-- -- spoke about all a lot

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:42.944
of our are things that we

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.879
went out on strike for in U.

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.848
T. LA we went out on strike

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:48.049
for the schools our students

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:49.617
deserve we went out on

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:51.452
strike to and random searches

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:55.923
this is one of our T. shirts

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.959
students not suspects we don't

01:29:58.025 --> 01:29:59.627
want to criminalize our children

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:01.562
in a place of learning I have

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:02.730
to say I was a little taken

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.665
aback when I drove up here on a

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:07.268
people free day and saw police

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:08.803
cars in front of the school

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:10.138
I don't think that we should

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:12.473
normalize that so one of the

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:13.708
things we went out on strike

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.676
for was ten random searches on

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.278
our schools and not only did we

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:18.479
get that but the school board

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:20.248
then voted to end them across

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:21.549
the district but I want to

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:22.750
make you aware something that

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:24.852
happened a Dorsey -- within the

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.355
last month there was a Malay

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:29.056
or whatever you want to call it

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.926
of some students and the

01:30:31.993 --> 01:30:34.495
the the school police pepper

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.497
sprayed the students at Dorsey

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:38.099
and Dorsey is a school that

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:39.534
is predominantly students of

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.903
color so I don't I hope that

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:42.837
we're not going to get into a

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.338
situation where we and random

01:30:44.405 --> 01:30:46.307
searches and we replace it with

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:47.942
something else that's toxic like

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.443
pepper spray in our students

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.412
we really need the supports

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:53.681
in place superintendent Brough

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:55.049
user spoke about community

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.818
schools that was another thing

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:57.885
that we went out on strike

01:30:57.952 --> 01:30:59.787
for community schools and this

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:01.689
this for Fremont high school

01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:03.658
is absolutely beautiful it's

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.827
my first time here and to know

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.528
that there are systems in place

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:08.796
to support the students and

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:10.364
the families of this community

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.500
are amazing I can you imagine

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.101
if we have that at all of our

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:16.337
over nine hundred campuses a man

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:18.973
I would thank you ready

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.875
I was a seventeen and a half

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.009
year teacher at Robert hill

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:23.110
lane elementary school which

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:24.412
is an east area right across

01:31:24.478 --> 01:31:25.813
the street from Robert hill I'm

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.849
sorry from east LA college can

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:29.317
you imagine if we had health

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.052
services at all of our schools

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.187
so I'm glad the superintendent

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:34.622
superintendent pewter is on the

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.090
bandwagon for community schools

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:36.891
because we had to go out on

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:39.527
strike for that and I'm glad

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.062
that he's on board and I

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.463
really hope that the that the

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.432
state of California find more

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:45.666
of those because the federal

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.435
government is and in the funding

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:50.104
I do have notes here

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:52.807
so you can take me out of

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:53.975
the classroom but you can't

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:55.042
make me not be a teacher

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:57.478
so I brought my reality --

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:03.217
we as people that are white and

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:04.352
I'm looking around and I may

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:05.753
be one of the only ones in here

01:32:06.053 --> 01:32:07.555
need to be more than just not

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.457
races we need to be actively

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.859
anti racist we need to stand up

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:13.761
and be allies of our students

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:15.463
of color are communities of

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:17.398
color are friends of color we

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:18.733
can't just sit back and say

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.134
well I don't burn crosses are I

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:22.370
don't wear a hood that's great

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:24.572
don't do that but also be out

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:26.073
there and actively support our

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.975
students be more than just not

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:30.344
races to be actively anti racist

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:32.580
-- I want to talk about --

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:35.149
conscious bias and the

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.918
definition is unconscious bias

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:38.619
either social stereo types about

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:40.254
certain groups of people the

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:41.689
individuals from outside their

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:44.258
own conscience -- from outside

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:45.760
their own conscious awareness

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:47.028
everyone holds and conscious

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.496
beliefs about various social

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:50.331
and identity a group and these

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.066
by see stem from one's tendency

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:53.601
to organize social world by

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:55.603
categories and unconscious

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.171
biases former prevalent

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:58.506
been conscious prejudice

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.308
and are often incompatible

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:01.142
with one's conscious

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:02.944
values certain scenarios

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.078
can activate unconscious

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.646
attitudes and beliefs for

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:07.081
example by cities may be more

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.816
prevalent when multi tasking

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:10.184
or working under pressure

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:13.287
so when we as teachers at the

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:14.689
school site and hopefully and

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:16.157
community schools across the

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:17.591
state that would be amazing

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.961
we can bring the things into

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:21.128
our classroom here's another

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:22.396
teaching her that says

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:24.332
education not deportation

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:26.767
on Tuesday's utility members

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.035
were read every week so

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.203
I've got a lot of teachers

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.306
another -- group that we

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:33.808
can support if you're if

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:35.676
you're an ally or if you're

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.878
black black lives matter LA

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:42.817
and this is one that -- are you

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:44.585
tell a racial justice task force

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:46.988
made and all the great

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.789
if you can't see it it said in

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.458
our class we believe black lives

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:52.460
matter women's rights are human

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:55.096
rights no human is illegal Xena

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:57.064
phobias wrong love is love and

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:59.333
kindness is everything so we

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.168
have to actively show that we

01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:02.636
believe in our students that

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:04.138
we believe in our communities

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.173
I'm gonna wrap up soon ready

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.175
I did bring some other --

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:10.077
books that if you're educate

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:11.679
if you're an educator or if

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.214
you're somebody that supports

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.950
-- students can buy to help

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:19.120
-- to help our students one

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:20.588
is for white folks to teach in

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:22.523
the hood and I actually heard

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.325
the speaker this summer in in

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:26.927
DC and one of his quotes I'm

01:34:26.994 --> 01:34:27.995
gonna get it wrong but it was

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:29.363
something to the effect of

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.866
you are somebody's ancestor

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.268
teach like it so for the future

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.737
generations when I die when

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:38.906
might you know three great

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.275
grandchildren generations down

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:44.078
-- look back on me am I going

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:45.679
to be teaching to make them

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:47.181
proud or am I going to be

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:49.283
teaching to make them want

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.252
to you know not recognize

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:55.756
teaching for black lives

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.192
there's a black lives matter

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:59.527
week in February I think it

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:01.028
starts February seventh of

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:02.163
twenty twenty don't quote

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:03.731
me on that date but teaching

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:05.232
for black lives and when

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:06.767
we teach for black lives

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.970
that means that we don't teach

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:11.505
for other lives it means that

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:12.807
were recognizing the black

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:15.209
students at that time --

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:18.345
wait fertility why it's

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:19.380
so hard for white people

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.748
to talk about racism

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.152
why are all the black kids

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:25.986
sitting together in the

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:27.888
cafeteria they're teaching

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.857
tolerance has a movement to

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.559
have -- an integrated lunch

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:33.794
week where you sit with students

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:34.995
-- where the students it

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:35.996
was students that they don't

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:38.265
normally sit with to integrate

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:39.967
-- different groups across the

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:42.503
the the -- campus and

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.338
push out the criminalization of

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:46.907
black girls in schools somebody

01:35:46.974 --> 01:35:49.610
mentioned earlier hair why

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.846
do we have to actually make a

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:54.782
law about legalizing somebody's

01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:57.284
hair but we did Holly Mitchell

01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:58.786
brought that and it's now law in

01:35:58.853 --> 01:36:00.488
the state of California the we

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:03.157
legalize hair my hair would

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:05.292
never be illegal and there's

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:07.128
a problem with that so when

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:09.063
we talk about what educators

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.931
need we need to address their

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:13.234
unconscious bias and we need

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.869
to do it in a meaningful manner

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:17.138
I Tuesday PT that's one hour

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:18.339
after the teachers of worked

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.141
all day isn't sufficient

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.043
I to the -- Saturday where

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.345
they're coming for three hours

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:25.446
and getting paid twenty five

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:27.414
dollars is insufficient if

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:29.049
we want to systemic change

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.484
we need an investment from

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:32.386
the state of California into

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:33.721
professional development

01:36:33.787 --> 01:36:36.056
for educators and for all of

01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:37.558
the adults on the campus and

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:38.759
with that I'm going to and

01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:46.767
next

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:51.105
thank you so much and I couldn't

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:53.174
agree more with my other two

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.675
colleagues sitting here and

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:55.876
I'm very pleased to be here

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:57.778
Sherrie Taylor I'm Los Angeles

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:59.747
county office of education and

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.815
assembly member Jones Sawyer you

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:04.752
are man after my own heart

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:07.788
I believe in the power of words

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:09.557
and I believe that speaking

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.592
promise versus speaking from

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:14.528
a deficit model is empowering

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.497
and principle as the file as

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:18.599
I walk through your hallways I

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:21.468
see I saw all of your the parts

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:23.771
that you and your staff have put

01:37:23.837 --> 01:37:26.040
up and I can only imagine how

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:28.475
empowered the students feel here

01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:29.810
and it it just touched my heart

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:31.078
for the moment I walked on to

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:32.880
the campus of thank you I think

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:34.548
you family members community

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:36.784
members students for being

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:39.520
here and for sharing in this

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:41.789
very important issue and

01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:44.558
-- just showing your support

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:46.160
coming using and being willing

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:48.162
to step up and use your voice is

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.698
so important so I wanted

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:53.200
to mention someone I'm not sure

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:54.368
if you're familiar with her

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:56.437
but doctor to rent that Carter

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:59.506
Andrews is a professor at the

01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:02.176
-- universe is state of

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.578
Michigan university for the

01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:07.014
teacher education department and

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:08.582
there she teaches about multi

01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:10.951
culturalism and about a critical

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:13.187
race theory and she talks

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.123
about she talks to new teachers

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:18.993
about how to enter into the

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:22.563
the teaching profession and

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:25.499
really go de a

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:28.469
reflective deeply about what

01:38:28.535 --> 01:38:30.871
it is the thing you want to do

01:38:30.938 --> 01:38:32.806
in terms of touching the lives

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:34.475
of their students and building

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.310
the kinds of relationships that

01:38:36.377 --> 01:38:38.178
are going to make them the kind

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:40.414
of teacher that people are that

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:41.682
those students are going to

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:44.852
remember for a positive reason

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:47.121
she says the teachers want

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:49.556
to address their biases like

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.025
you're talking about they want

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:53.127
to be able to be open about

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:55.362
that but it's very difficult

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:57.798
for them to find a safe space

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.633
that they need so that they

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.201
can talk about something that

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:02.536
they're feeling without feeling

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.238
like they're going to be poorly

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:05.973
evaluated for something that

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.541
maybe they don't even know why

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:10.144
the the feel a certain way

01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:11.745
why they might have a certain

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:14.081
bias they often don't feel that

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:16.450
they have the time so she says

01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:18.285
something that rings true with

01:39:18.352 --> 01:39:20.754
me is that we need to move past

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:24.124
just having one diversity

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:26.727
-- workshop a year we need

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:28.262
to get house just making

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:30.097
it a theme that we show up

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:33.000
to and we -- embrace

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:35.803
that one day we need to embed

01:39:36.203 --> 01:39:38.539
this very important work and

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:41.241
to our day to day reflections

01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:43.110
and are David day work

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:47.047
it takes critical

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:48.716
self reflection and

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:50.918
it takes critical love

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:55.155
to do this work you

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:57.791
can't have the two separated

01:39:58.525 --> 01:40:00.861
and so touching the hearts

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:02.830
of children starts with

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:05.065
touching the lives on the

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:07.768
minds of the adults who work

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.303
with the children every day

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.838
and there on the frontline

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:14.942
so every day we need to

01:40:15.008 --> 01:40:17.478
be asking ourselves how does

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:20.047
money social location my

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:23.283
class my gender my worries

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.486
my religion how does the dot

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.921
in fact an impact mine mine

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:30.624
set water those kinds of

01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:33.293
-- biases that I might

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.329
not even know that I have

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:38.265
we all have implicit bias

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:41.301
like it or not we all have

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:43.103
that and so we all have to

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:45.806
address that on a daily basis

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.075
we have to ask ourselves

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:50.944
how can we know more about

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:52.746
what we don't know how do

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:54.114
we know more about how to

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:56.216
address the biases that we

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.352
carry around with us maybe

01:40:58.419 --> 01:41:00.554
from childhood he may be some

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:02.423
things that we thought came

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:04.224
from a dinner conversation

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:05.893
that happened we were little

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:08.295
and it just kept on living into

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:10.597
our life somehow so it's up to

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:12.433
us to figure out what that is

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:14.268
and to pull it out and look at

01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:15.636
it and not be afraid to talk

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:18.372
about it -- and then how

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:20.774
do we continue as

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:22.810
leaders and education and nots

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.745
leaders in the classroom doubts

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:27.014
leaders in administration how to

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.349
we all come together and be

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:32.586
very courageously old

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.988
about addressing issues of

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:38.292
power racism and implicit bias

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:41.228
it's not a one and done

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:44.865
application so I want to talk

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.800
to you about positive behavior

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:48.502
interventions and supports

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:50.537
because when I talk about these

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:52.739
things about how do I how I

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:54.942
can know what I need to do but

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:56.844
if I'm operating and a system

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.979
with an a school where I don't

01:41:59.046 --> 01:42:01.381
however that Steve space and I

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:03.584
don't have that time built in

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:05.519
because that's not the culture

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:07.588
of the school I'm probably

01:42:07.654 --> 01:42:08.989
never going to be doing that

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:10.557
except at night before I lay

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.293
my head down on the pillow so

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.028
I want to tell you about that

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:17.231
it's an evidence based framework

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:20.067
for supporting schools to be

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:24.872
double safe consistent

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:28.575
I an equitable for

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:31.245
all students but knowing

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.546
what we've talked about their

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:35.215
different layers of what we

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.084
look out for all students

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:39.119
we can't be afraid to look

01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:40.354
at what are some of those

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.422
barriers that impact students

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:43.824
of color and students of

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:45.459
poverty and a different way

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:46.793
than all the rest of the

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.929
students but never the less

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:51.665
that that all means all

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:54.401
is -- critical for the work

01:42:54.468 --> 01:42:56.236
that we do in positive behavior

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:57.704
interventions and support

01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:01.241
it's recognize P. I. S. is

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.143
recognized and indicated

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:04.845
by both individuals with

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:07.347
disabilities and Education Act

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:10.817
ID a and every child succeeds

01:43:10.884 --> 01:43:13.320
act esse or E. at that day

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:16.156
the I. S. as a multi tiered

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:18.659
system of support that when

01:43:18.725 --> 01:43:21.061
it's embraced by everyone

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:23.130
at the school not means

01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:25.666
everyone of the also all

01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:28.468
staff whether it's -- teachers

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:31.605
administrators support staff --

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:34.875
that parents family members

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:38.378
everyone community members --

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:41.014
it is a way of enhancing

01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:43.584
the adoption and implementation

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:46.019
of a continuum of evidence

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:48.555
based practices to achieve

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:50.857
important outcomes for students

01:43:50.924 --> 01:43:52.593
that are academic social

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:54.094
emotional and behavioral

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:58.198
the I. S. is critical for

01:43:58.265 --> 01:44:00.434
supporting all students in the

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:03.070
local context through a trauma

01:44:03.136 --> 01:44:05.305
informed and equitable system

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:09.977
the I. S. allows for offense

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:11.878
with county office of education

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:13.280
and over three thousand

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:15.616
other educational agencies

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:18.151
in California to utilize

01:44:18.218 --> 01:44:19.920
the systematic framework

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:22.723
to reduce bias in our schools

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:25.459
so how is this accomplished

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.395
we can't talk about anything if

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:29.663
we what we always say in P. V.

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.264
I. S. if you talk about P. B.

01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:32.699
I. S. and you don't talk about

01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:34.768
data then you don't have people

01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:36.236
yeah yeah because you really

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:38.338
need to know it's not just

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.906
about how you feel things are

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:42.342
going has a lot of times you

01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:43.710
can feel that things are really

01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:45.178
going well but you have to

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:47.981
find out how things are really

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:49.416
working and how well things

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:51.151
are being implemented so we

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:52.953
know that the national child

01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.988
and traumatic stress network

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:57.624
from UCLA and Duke university's

01:44:59.192 --> 01:45:01.161
tell us that students who

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:03.530
have experienced trauma need

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:05.465
environments that are all

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.401
beings P. V. I. S. that are

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:10.037
predictable safe positive

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.872
consistent and equitable

01:45:12.839 --> 01:45:14.841
and yeah I as has made

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:17.044
a significant impact on

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:18.945
children who have experience

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:21.548
simple and complex trauma

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:24.551
the I. S. allows for an

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.253
integrated and collaborative

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:29.056
teams that comes together after

01:45:29.122 --> 01:45:31.258
school but they include those

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:33.694
teams include family members

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.629
they include community members

01:45:35.696 --> 01:45:37.664
they include students because we

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:40.000
can't leave any voices are heard

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:43.904
and so the P. V. I. S. team

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:46.573
is the one that creates that

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.376
plan for that school in that

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:51.712
context no one is coming in and

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:53.346
saying this is a program you

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:55.148
use this is the curriculum we

01:45:55.215 --> 01:45:57.217
use we can't tell you how we

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:59.453
give you tools but that's up

01:45:59.519 --> 01:46:01.888
to the people who live out the

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:03.557
school day in and day out to

01:46:03.623 --> 01:46:05.158
make that difference for their

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:07.094
their students and their staff

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:10.097
it's all about improving quality

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:11.398
of life so we say if you're

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:13.033
implement the P. B. I. as in

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.101
you're not feeling pretty good

01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:15.669
about it something needs to

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.237
be tweaked with the system

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:19.773
and and -- and

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.542
improve so the --

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:26.113
at the I a support schools

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:27.280
in creating an environment to

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:29.149
respond to student needs for a

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:31.084
comprehensive structure using

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.620
data systems and practices

01:46:35.288 --> 01:46:36.957
the I. S. has over twenty

01:46:37.023 --> 01:46:38.792
years of research demonstrating

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:40.460
positive outcomes for

01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:42.729
students and this decreasing

01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:44.164
disproportionate holiday

01:46:45.165 --> 01:46:46.633
in their research the fact

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.702
of school Y. P. B. I. S. on

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:50.837
disciplinary exclusions for

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:53.440
students with disabilities and

01:46:53.507 --> 01:46:55.742
out without disabilities doctors

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:58.612
Nicholas cage and Nicole it

01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:00.981
gracefully boring focused on

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:02.649
schools who have implemented

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:04.384
PP I as with fidelity a

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:06.353
tier one with fidelity

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:10.423
these outcomes showed a student

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:12.659
any student in the school is

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:14.928
thirty seven percent less likely

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:17.264
to have received one out of

01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:20.167
school suspension I has panic

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:22.569
student is thirty three less

01:47:22.636 --> 01:47:24.471
likely to have received one

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:26.173
out of school suspension with

01:47:26.239 --> 01:47:28.842
PP I as simply a student

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:30.977
is thirty seven percent less

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:33.180
likely to have received one or

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:35.715
more out of school suspension

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:38.652
a black student is thirty

01:47:38.718 --> 01:47:40.420
five less likely thirty five

01:47:40.487 --> 01:47:42.355
percent less likely to lose

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:44.558
a day of instruction due

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:46.393
to out of school suspension

01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:49.196
a student is thirty five

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:51.731
percent less likely to lose a

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.867
day of instruction due to out

01:47:53.934 --> 01:47:55.869
of school suspension a student

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:58.839
with a disability is sixty nine

01:47:58.905 --> 01:48:01.141
percent less likely to Brough

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:03.243
you referred to an alternate

01:48:03.577 --> 01:48:05.245
setting for disciplinary

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:08.081
reasons so I agree

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:10.283
with you and that is

01:48:11.117 --> 01:48:13.119
my voice people who look

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:15.856
like me need to

01:48:16.923 --> 01:48:19.025
up we need everyone's voice

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:20.861
I'm not saying that -- if

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:23.363
you were to open my childhood

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:25.932
and look at it I had issues

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:27.300
of domestic violence of

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:29.669
my family I had issues of

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:32.272
-- divorce I had issues of

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:33.573
all kinds of other things I

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:36.610
still benefitted from the socio

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:39.212
economic system that we have in

01:48:39.279 --> 01:48:41.248
the United States just because

01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:43.216
of the color of my skin you

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:45.018
wouldn't know those things about

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:47.487
me those are things probably

01:48:47.554 --> 01:48:49.189
a lot of us might have in common

01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:50.624
but there are so many other

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:53.426
layers and I am going to use

01:48:53.493 --> 01:48:55.328
my voice I always have and they

01:48:55.395 --> 01:48:57.163
plan to for the rest of my life

01:48:57.764 --> 01:48:59.399
to be able to get the word out

01:48:59.466 --> 01:49:01.234
there about what we need to do

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:04.070
to make our schools to be

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:07.407
all of the things that we

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:08.975
protect the ball that we

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:10.877
talked about predictable

01:49:11.244 --> 01:49:14.047
and safe and positive

01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:16.650
and -- consistent and

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:19.886
equitable so if I had a dream

01:49:20.587 --> 01:49:22.889
market to fill --

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:25.692
I would ask for

01:49:25.926 --> 01:49:27.994
some consideration in in the

01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:29.996
magical world of the legislature

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:32.399
that you live in that we

01:49:32.465 --> 01:49:35.068
would -- in addition we've

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:37.504
already put the -- we've

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:38.838
already put positive behavior

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:40.206
interventions and supports

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.142
support into the new teacher

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:44.110
standards wouldn't it be a

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:46.279
beautiful world if we really

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:49.416
did require a system of support

01:49:49.482 --> 01:49:51.484
that's PVI as in all of our

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.653
schools and our wonderful state

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.355
of California that would be my

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:58.091
of my little wishlist but thank

01:49:58.158 --> 01:50:00.827
you so much for this opportunity

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:03.063
I'm so grateful to --

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:05.198
speak on behalf of AB from the

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:07.767
students thank you thank you

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:09.936
can get it my hand round of Los

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:13.707
thank you -- the the

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:14.975
one thing that I kind of

01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:16.409
heard in in and is going

01:50:16.476 --> 01:50:17.277
to help me when I go

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:19.479
back -- we talked about

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:22.182
non minorities

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.818
teachers and --

01:50:25.685 --> 01:50:28.154
-- non people of color

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:29.856
being able to understand the

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:31.224
plight of what's going on

01:50:32.158 --> 01:50:34.394
unfortunately -- I should

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:36.763
add that there are after

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:39.165
American Latino legislators

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.869
who advocate for policies

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:44.371
that are detrimental to rural

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:46.573
communities I've after American

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.742
legislators to advocate for

01:50:49.275 --> 01:50:50.643
mandatory minimums three

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:53.413
strikes longer sentences I'd

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.448
like Tino legislators that

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:57.317
talk about criminals who

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:59.419
are immigrants on the floor

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:00.920
the assembly so we also have

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:03.156
some work to do among our own

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:05.425
people too so it's not just

01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:08.228
non people of color and so

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:09.229
we have to a lot of work to

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:11.598
do all the way around -- so

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.233

would like for the legislation

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.642
to work on if that might

throat if we're lucky

01:56:33.286 --> 01:56:35.455
for me that directed me

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:42.362
briefly summarize

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:51.371
-- sorry for the informal

01:56:51.437 --> 01:56:52.605
translation here I mean yeah

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.907
that's not -- she said

01:56:54.974 --> 01:56:56.142
she wanted to use our self her

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:57.343
name is a nearly as you the

01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:59.278
parent here -- at this high

01:56:59.345 --> 01:57:00.780
school and she just wanted to

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.148
note that since two thousand

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:03.983
seven she's heard a lot about

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.651
school wide support systems

01:57:05.918 --> 01:57:08.254
but in the past ten years

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:09.355
she hasn't seen a full

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:11.557
implementation of programs to

01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:14.193
really support students and --

01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:16.796
she notes sort of the

01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:18.798
number of detentions that used

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:19.999
to be given to students and

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:21.734
so on some occasions are given

01:57:21.801 --> 01:57:23.703
the students and not we know

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:25.471
that and she wanted it noted

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:27.006
that knowing that students

01:57:27.073 --> 01:57:29.442
are are losing a day or two

01:57:29.509 --> 01:57:31.277
of schooling means that their

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.179
likelihood of going to prison

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:34.814
increases drastically by twenty

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:37.083
six percent so she just wanted

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:39.419
to say sort of in these past

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:41.287
ten years what has been done

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:42.855
and though her children have

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:45.258
not really face those issues --

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:47.126
in terms of detention she had

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:48.594
they have had to face comments

01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:50.096
from teachers -- speaking

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:52.432
about how they compare go white

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:54.100
students at the top previously

01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:56.769
for being disgusted by --

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:58.604
by her children in particular

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:00.573
and so she just wanted to

01:58:00.973 --> 01:58:03.075
let voice those concerns and

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:04.377
really say thank you to all the

01:58:04.444 --> 01:58:06.279
speakers here and for working

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:07.880
on this issue and that she

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:09.081
hopes that we can all continue

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:10.183
to work on this issue moving

01:58:10.249 --> 01:58:12.084
forward as a matter of policy

01:58:12.151 --> 01:58:14.287
-- in the coming years later no

01:58:14.353 --> 01:58:16.088
we're gonna work on the tension

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:18.458
and it's been call continuation

01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:21.027
schools which is really a a --

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:23.095
continuation schools have led

01:58:23.329 --> 01:58:24.597
to the school to prison pipeline

02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:45.638
of the visions we have in this

02:00:45.705 --> 02:00:47.640
community is to try and see

02:00:47.707 --> 02:00:49.475
how we can facilitate something

02:00:49.542 --> 02:00:52.078
like that -- for the summertime

02:00:52.345 --> 02:00:54.280
I know this summer you know

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:55.715
we've had a program here at

02:00:55.781 --> 02:00:57.416
Fremont are on a trip to New

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:59.318
ship for young people as part of

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:00.987
a violence prevention strategy

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.989
you know -- which is what you

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:04.457
know of freedom school is all

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:06.392
about it is a national program

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:08.260
it is in California you know

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:09.729
-- and we've been able to do it

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:11.664
you know in various communities

02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:12.431
you know through community

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:14.500
coalition you know -- and how

02:01:14.567 --> 02:01:15.801
many that Mathis shows when I

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:17.470
passed it you know around that

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:18.871
so I don't know you know what

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:20.840
how can we access some of those

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.074
funny because that's a very

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:24.577
very expensive program and also

02:01:24.644 --> 02:01:26.078
very very effective program

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:28.714
you know in terms of -- how

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:30.616
we can you know look you know

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:33.319
all that and then the --

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:35.554
the other piece you know -- he's

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:39.058
how can we continue you

02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:40.660
know -- to collaborate with

02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:42.895
you as you take all these

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:45.531
legislative pieces in terms of

02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:48.134
-- being you know a sounding

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.002
board for you supporting you

02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:51.604
under getting you you know

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:53.339
as you move you know these

02:01:53.406 --> 02:01:55.574
positive -- legislative pieces

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.677
for because we know you know

02:01:57.743 --> 02:01:59.545
-- -- you don't up there by

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:01.013
yourself by religion on and

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.248
we are here to see how we can

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:03.716
work and live with you you know

02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:05.551
around those pieces so are those

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:06.652
are the two that I just well

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.020
enough that you know around

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:09.588
that thanks everyone thank you

02:02:11.157 --> 02:02:12.858
and just quickly week we may be

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:14.827
close to it I just need to know

02:02:15.094 --> 02:02:16.462
it's not like we're we're full

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:17.963
support of community schools

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:19.665
in the commuter school concept

02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:20.966
I don't know the difference

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:22.201
between freedom schools

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:24.203
community schools and it the

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:25.638
delta between the two may not

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:27.540
be that far to where we do

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:28.908
community schools and maybe just

02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:30.276
a little extra funding to get

02:02:30.342 --> 02:02:32.545
to communities to if we can sit

02:02:32.611 --> 02:02:34.346
and talk about the two concept

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:36.615
with C. U. T. LA which you doing

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:39.051
and then on as far legislation I

02:02:39.118 --> 02:02:40.986
just need people to to to write

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:43.289
letters on at promises to the to

02:02:43.355 --> 02:02:44.790
the governor's desk as soon as

02:02:44.857 --> 02:02:46.559
possible you heard to retain a

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:48.260
Butte their favourite a letter

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:50.563
today so the sooner the better

02:02:52.164 --> 02:02:53.699
I also afternoon everyone thank

02:02:53.766 --> 02:02:54.934
you family member Jones Sawyer

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.702
for doing this year leadership

02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:59.238
-- on A. B. two fifty eight

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:00.973
and everything else -- and

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.608
freedom schools I believe are

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:03.809
tomorrow from the children's

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:06.212
defense fund that -- have you

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:07.780
focus on literacy and started

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:08.748
sort of the civil rights

02:03:08.814 --> 02:03:09.915
movement community schools are

02:03:09.982 --> 02:03:11.550
like wraparound school that a

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:13.285
village that we know it takes

02:03:13.352 --> 02:03:14.820
the raise the child and there

02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:16.355
are definitely some synergy in

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:18.057
some integration between them

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:19.759
-- so my name is Amir would

02:03:19.825 --> 02:03:21.026
become a policy attorney with

02:03:21.093 --> 02:03:22.762
the ACLU of southern California

02:03:23.028 --> 02:03:24.430
-- also researcher with the

02:03:24.497 --> 02:03:25.631
Salih civil rights project and

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:27.266
I've done work with them on

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:28.801
this issue and I want to share

02:03:28.868 --> 02:03:30.202
a report I have copies that I

02:03:30.269 --> 02:03:32.037
provide for you as well because

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:34.073
-- we just published earlier

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:36.742
this year the largest reporter

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:38.043
first report on a school based

02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:40.112
mental health -- it we looked

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:41.046
at every school in the country

02:03:41.113 --> 02:03:42.448
off fifty million students

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.750
-- and we found as you all

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:45.818
know in probably her here in

02:03:45.885 --> 02:03:47.186
California were forty eighth

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:49.088
in the nation when it comes to

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:50.656
student access the counselors

02:03:51.023 --> 02:03:53.058
-- experts recommend what counts

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:53.959
for every two hundred fifty

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:56.095
students nationwide is one

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:57.496
counts ready for Jim forty for

02:03:57.563 --> 02:03:59.165
students in California's one

02:03:59.231 --> 02:04:00.266
counts for almost every seven

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:02.234
hundred students and we have

02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:03.402
some of that students face in

02:04:03.469 --> 02:04:04.436
the highest level the family

02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:06.338
separation and other forms of

02:04:06.405 --> 02:04:07.573
trauma adversity highs levels

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.375
of homelessness hi number

02:04:09.441 --> 02:04:10.743
English learners and other

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:13.345
things so what they sell you --

02:04:13.412 --> 02:04:15.848
here specifically in LA --

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:19.018
we part of a lawsuit the cocoa

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:20.219
will represent a community

02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:22.655
schools or committee coalition

02:04:22.888 --> 02:04:24.990
an effort to ensure that a high

02:04:25.057 --> 02:04:27.359
needs school receiving what

02:04:27.426 --> 02:04:28.294
they were entitled to on the

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:30.796
lawn there el cap LCF at --

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:32.364
because the district were not

02:04:32.431 --> 02:04:33.566
originally given those funds

02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:34.900
to the students need because

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:36.502
understate lawsuit schools with

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:38.938
higher in his students low

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:40.339
income high accented English

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:41.974
learners foster you should

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:43.776
receive more students -- but

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:44.710
the schools were getting that

02:04:44.777 --> 02:04:45.611
originally but through the

02:04:45.678 --> 02:04:47.246
settlement -- they were able

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:48.414
to hire additional psychiatric

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.249
social workers and other things

02:04:50.482 --> 02:04:52.685
so it's not we know that

02:04:52.751 --> 02:04:54.286
funds are limited and --

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.589
schools don't have enough but

02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:58.123
there's also an issue here

02:04:58.357 --> 02:05:00.526
with this funds not be in place

02:05:00.726 --> 02:05:02.027
in prioritize where they are

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:03.229
and that's a big part of the

02:05:03.295 --> 02:05:04.997
school to prison pipeline --

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:06.398
here in California one in this

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:07.933
is in our report as well there

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.668
several times as many police

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:11.437
in schools and social workers

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:12.938
it's almost by default that a

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.607
school -- will have police here

02:05:14.673 --> 02:05:16.108
in LA U. S. the almost eighty

02:05:16.175 --> 02:05:17.509
million dollars a year on school

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:19.211
police the largest school police

02:05:19.278 --> 02:05:21.614
force -- in the country and

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:22.815
most girls don't have social

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:24.683
workers this by default and

02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:25.985
there's by one social worker

02:05:26.051 --> 02:05:27.086
for every about two thousand

02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:29.388
students here as well so that's

02:05:29.455 --> 02:05:30.422
a big part of the school to

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:32.191
prison pipeline we also saw

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:33.859
that there several times many

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:35.427
security guards in California

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:36.862
schools and school nurses

02:05:37.296 --> 02:05:39.665
-- M. at they sell you we

02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:41.734
represented students who in

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.702
southern California -- were

02:05:43.769 --> 02:05:45.571
placed on probation for reasons

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:47.539
like grieving or other things

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:48.574
that would have been addressed

02:05:48.641 --> 02:05:49.541
through the school based

02:05:49.608 --> 02:05:51.410
mental health professionals --

02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:52.912
but instead they were placed

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:53.946
through the school to prison

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:55.347
pipeline in part because the

02:05:55.414 --> 02:05:57.316
school didn't have the proper

02:05:57.383 --> 02:05:59.018
staffing so they were probation

02:05:59.084 --> 02:06:00.052
offices there so they were

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:01.854
placed on voluntary probation

02:06:02.154 --> 02:06:03.956
that I was the program here

02:06:04.156 --> 02:06:05.758
ended in LA county last school

02:06:05.824 --> 02:06:07.860
year -- that places students

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:09.328
on voluntary probation as part

02:06:09.395 --> 02:06:10.429
of school to prison pipeline so

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:12.064
what we see is the schools don't

02:06:12.131 --> 02:06:13.232
have the right resources and

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:15.134
if something else then that's

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.502
what ends up trapping them

02:06:16.568 --> 02:06:19.104
in the system -- and we also

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:22.174
see here -- --

02:06:22.875 --> 02:06:23.943
Dorsey that was mentioned

02:06:24.009 --> 02:06:25.044
earlier that the pepper spray

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:26.645
incident that happened at Dorsey

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:28.447
-- which again and thank you

02:06:28.514 --> 02:06:30.549
for the to incredibly -- when

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:32.518
that happened a within an hour I

02:06:32.584 --> 02:06:34.486
got tax from teachers Instagram

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:36.088
messages from students showing

02:06:36.155 --> 02:06:37.489
the incident number ten police

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:39.058
on campus responding to and you

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.793
saw some of them just sprained

02:06:41.026 --> 02:06:42.428
pepper spray indiscriminately

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:44.096
-- in the situation and this is

02:06:44.163 --> 02:06:46.131
something that is out of in band

02:06:46.198 --> 02:06:48.367
in juvenile facilities so think

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:49.535
about that how can we can't

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:51.437
spray pepper spray which is

02:06:51.503 --> 02:06:54.106
poison on ice right especially

02:06:54.173 --> 02:06:55.474
if the odds are still growing

02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:56.976
children is still development

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:58.944
-- that's able to happen in

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:00.346
our schools but not in argue

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:01.714
presence so that's something we

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.115
we definitely need the challenge

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:05.651
-- and this week is actually

02:07:05.718 --> 02:07:06.719
the California association

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.520
school counselors national --

02:07:08.754 --> 02:07:10.122
annual conference in riverside

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:11.490
will work with them a present

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:12.624
in there but we work with the

02:07:12.691 --> 02:07:14.994
other people service personnel

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:16.261
to CalPERS office and school

02:07:16.328 --> 02:07:18.397
psychologists and others and

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:19.798
sounds like they need to be a

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:21.867
right to care at school this

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:23.669
was a comment -- the California

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:25.504
school nurse association noted

02:07:25.571 --> 02:07:27.006
that in almost half of schools

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:29.108
might not have a a nurse school

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:31.310
and if as we share earlier if

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:32.544
many students are you receiving

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:33.879
their care in school that

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.014
means they don't have the right

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:37.449
to care so we have a lot of

02:07:37.516 --> 02:07:38.717
oracle careless schools were

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:39.885
students just don't have the

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.553
right to access in here and

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:42.588
as was mentioned are I think

02:07:42.654 --> 02:07:43.789
the president and as that

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:45.157
forty percent of students in

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:46.692
some of the enclaves are at

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:49.061
risk for trauma -- more than

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:50.429
war torn countries if we know

02:07:50.496 --> 02:07:51.497
that the need and we're not

02:07:51.563 --> 02:07:52.798
responding with the resources

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:54.133
and responding with police

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:55.734
and probation then that is

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:56.869
the school to prison pipeline

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:58.270
so again thank you for your

02:07:58.337 --> 02:07:59.772
leadership on this and I want

02:07:59.838 --> 02:08:00.606
to give you a copy of our

02:08:00.672 --> 02:08:02.541
report from my contact info and

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.356
so Amir took a lot of what I was

02:08:17.423 --> 02:08:19.691
gonna say -- but I am

02:08:19.758 --> 02:08:20.826
going to reiterate some of the

02:08:20.893 --> 02:08:21.994
points that he made I think it's

02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:23.195
really important and again thank

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:25.197
you probably the start first of

02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:26.565
all my name is Joseph Williams

02:08:26.632 --> 02:08:27.699
I'm I'm director of operation

02:08:27.766 --> 02:08:29.735
the campaigns with -- students

02:08:29.802 --> 02:08:31.370
deserve -- we're an organization

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:32.838
that works with UCLA work with

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:34.273
a CO you work with black lives

02:08:34.339 --> 02:08:35.707
matter the push for the into

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:37.109
random searches in LA U. S. the

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:40.179
schools I know -- superintendent

02:08:40.245 --> 02:08:42.114
you earlier said the LAUSD used

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:44.883
to treat students like criminals

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:46.585
right and we know that that's

02:08:46.652 --> 02:08:47.853
still happening right we know

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.788
that at Dorothy high just a few

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:51.790
weeks ago right students were

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:53.725
indiscriminately pepper sprayed

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.694
at Los Angeles high school last

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:57.262
year black students were peppers

02:08:57.329 --> 02:08:58.197
right at this high school

02:08:58.263 --> 02:08:59.631
right Fremont high school two

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:00.999
or three years ago there with

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.101
the pepper spray incident were

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:03.435
seventeen people I believe had

02:09:03.502 --> 02:09:04.937
to be sent to the hospital right

02:09:05.003 --> 02:09:06.371
this is a a practice that has

02:09:06.438 --> 02:09:07.706
been outlawed in our juvenile

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:09.141
detention facilities but that

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:10.909
school police are still using on

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:13.312
a regular basis right primarily

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:15.247
against black students right

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:16.748
on so I think absolutely that's

02:09:16.815 --> 02:09:17.716
something that that needs to be

02:09:17.783 --> 02:09:18.584
addressed I hope that they're

02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:20.719
still folks from superintendent

02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:23.055
units office or the school board

02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:25.457
or you know whatever -- here to

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:26.558
the to take back some of this

02:09:26.625 --> 02:09:28.927
stuff -- I think that's a

02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:30.362
huge issue right that pepper

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:31.396
spray a chemical weapon is

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:32.598
still allowed to be used

02:09:32.664 --> 02:09:33.699
against our students against

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:35.968
are you right -- number two

02:09:36.368 --> 02:09:38.704
we talked again I think a number

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:39.838
of folks today mentioned the

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:42.107
the decline of -- suspensions

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:43.408
after the elimination of will

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:44.810
for the finance on the flip

02:09:44.877 --> 02:09:47.045
side of that has been a huge

02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:49.148
increase in arrests right

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:51.083
I don't think that's talked

02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:52.184
about enough at all right

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:53.152
we talk about the decline of

02:09:53.218 --> 02:09:54.586
suspensions and don't say what

02:09:54.653 --> 02:09:55.921
we're replacing them with were

02:09:55.988 --> 02:09:57.589
resting students instead of

02:09:57.656 --> 02:09:58.857
suspending students were sending

02:09:58.924 --> 02:10:01.026
students to the police right

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:03.395
arm which again a huge factor in

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:05.464
the school to prison pipeline --

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:07.699
especially black students there

02:10:07.766 --> 02:10:09.268
is a report released recently

02:10:09.334 --> 02:10:11.136
by million dollar -- the hoods

02:10:11.203 --> 02:10:12.538
project that you feel and I

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:14.406
think Ryan was here earlier

02:10:14.673 --> 02:10:16.775
-- basically saying that black

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:17.809
students are less than ten

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:18.977
percent around eight percent of

02:10:19.044 --> 02:10:20.612
LA U. S. the schools but almost

02:10:20.679 --> 02:10:22.347
thirty percent of those who are

02:10:22.414 --> 02:10:24.383
referred to the school police

02:10:24.449 --> 02:10:25.717
right for either divergence for

02:10:25.784 --> 02:10:28.120
citations for rest almost thirty

02:10:28.187 --> 02:10:29.121
percent of those students who

02:10:29.188 --> 02:10:30.622
are sent to school police are

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:31.857
black students even other less

02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:33.692
than ten percent of our schools

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:35.994
right so again another thing

02:10:36.061 --> 02:10:37.696
that I think the district you

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:39.464
know the school district as well

02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:40.999
as all the school district of in

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:42.801
LA county and and and California

02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:44.670
need to address as well --

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:46.705
and then finally -- somebody

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:48.874
mentioned that it doesn't cost

02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:50.409
to care right doesn't cost

02:10:50.475 --> 02:10:52.544
to care more absolutely but

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:54.613
-- our our budgets show our

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:57.015
priorities right Amir mentioned

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:58.917
LA U. S. -- LA U. S. the

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:00.519
number one the LA school police

02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:02.387
department is the largest school

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:03.655
police department in the entire

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.791
country right number two even

02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:06.858
in spite of that we're still

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:09.494
inviting LAPD LA county

02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:11.296
sheriffs and other police

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:12.731
departments on four campuses

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:14.666
even though we have our own

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:15.767
school police department right

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:17.269
as with mentioned that after

02:11:17.336 --> 02:11:19.104
this incident at Dorsey right

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:21.039
ten to fifteen LAPD officers

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:22.441
and also K. nine office the

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:23.942
canine units were brought onto

02:11:24.009 --> 02:11:25.277
campus not just for that day but

02:11:25.344 --> 02:11:27.179
for the rest of the week right

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:29.715
-- instilling this police

02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:32.117
presence in our students right

02:11:32.184 --> 02:11:33.552
this is the all in one of the

02:11:33.619 --> 02:11:35.387
few majority black schools

02:11:35.454 --> 02:11:37.256
left in Los Angeles and this is

02:11:37.322 --> 02:11:38.757
how we respond to the youthful

02:11:38.824 --> 02:11:40.492
behavior right I got in fights

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:41.893
when I was in school right

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:44.429
when I was eighteen right so

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:46.565
finally like I said that the

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:48.533
budget for for LA school police

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.202
department over eighty million

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:53.005
dollars LA LA school --

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.207
LA unified has had a commitments

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:56.775
of restorative justice now

02:11:56.842 --> 02:11:58.944
for almost five or ten years

02:11:59.144 --> 02:12:00.579
their annual expenditure on

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:02.614
the restorative justice is five

02:12:02.681 --> 02:12:04.783
million dollars five million

02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:06.385
dollars for restorative justice

02:12:06.451 --> 02:12:08.687
over eighty million dollars for

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:10.289
policing right so that shows

02:12:10.355 --> 02:12:11.456
you the priorities empower

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:13.358
responding to student behavior

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:15.560
to youth behavior right so I

02:12:15.627 --> 02:12:16.828
you know those three things like

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:17.963
I said pepper spray is still

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.399
being used on students arrested

02:12:20.465 --> 02:12:21.566
students are skyrocketing

02:12:21.633 --> 02:12:22.834
especially the rest of black

02:12:22.901 --> 02:12:24.636
students right and the the way

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:27.039
that our priorities the

02:12:27.105 --> 02:12:28.974
district priorities right are

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:30.275
are shown in our budget right

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:31.443
where we're spending over eighty

02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:33.378
million dollars on school police

02:12:33.445 --> 02:12:34.446
a couple years ago there was a

02:12:34.513 --> 02:12:35.947
controversy on -- folks remember

02:12:36.014 --> 02:12:36.948
when they were trying to get a

02:12:37.015 --> 02:12:39.384
anti tank anti you know

02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:41.286
terror tank and they have their

02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:42.888
own anti terrorist apartment

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:43.855
within the LA school police

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:44.956
department right so these are

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:45.891
the things literally that we're

02:12:45.957 --> 02:12:47.259
telling our students we look at

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:48.293
you as criminals we look at U.

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.761
S. terrace we look at you as a

02:12:49.828 --> 02:12:51.797
threat rather than as somebody

02:12:51.863 --> 02:12:52.964
who need services that somebody

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:54.499
needs support right as somebody

02:12:54.566 --> 02:12:55.967
who's who's coming from a place

02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:57.402
of trauma in a place of really

02:12:57.469 --> 02:12:59.071
great need right so I definitely

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:00.972
hope that you know again we

02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:02.174
can support you in in -- in the

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:03.108
work that you're doing that we

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:05.210
can continue to the up lift --

02:13:05.277 --> 02:13:06.378
these issues that they can be

02:13:06.445 --> 02:13:07.713
addressed by the superintendent

02:13:07.779 --> 02:13:09.414
by L. U. S. the and other folks

02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:16.254
so again I want to thank

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.656
everybody for being here today

02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:19.758
especially since it is a holiday

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:22.227
in schools off but most

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:24.730
important -- -- I've to me

02:13:24.796 --> 02:13:26.031
leave you with this one thing

02:13:27.399 --> 02:13:29.000
in my publisher said at the

02:13:29.067 --> 02:13:30.969
beginning about being careful

02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:33.372
about be careful who you talk to

02:13:34.439 --> 02:13:36.375
-- because I am one

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:37.809
of a hundred and twenty

02:13:37.876 --> 02:13:40.145
people that make the Los four

02:13:40.212 --> 02:13:42.581
forty million Californians if
