WE'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.596
THIS WILDFIRE. ISSUE IN

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:30.200
PREVENTION- AND SIGNIFICANT

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.802
FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR

THAT WILL GO INTO DOING THE MUCH

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:38.808
NEEDED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:43.146
SENDING- MECHANICAL. FORESTRY

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:46.216
MANAGEMENT- PRESCRIBED FIRE MANY

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:48.184
DIFFERENT METHODS TO ENSURE THAT

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.486
WE GET OUR FORCE INTO A

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:51.721
HEALTHIER CAN CONDITION GET A

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.523
LOT OF THE BRUSH AND FUEL LOADS-

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.925
THAT MAKE OUR- FORCE A TINDER

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:58.695
BOX WAITING TO HAPPEN. AND HELP

00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:01.131
AVOID- DEVASTATING FIRES LIKE IN

00:55:01.197 --> 00:55:04.934
PARADISE LIKE IN GREENVILLE.

00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:08.438
LIKE IN BERRY CREEK- IN MY PART

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:11.007
OF THE STATE- BUT THE ONE THE

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:13.209
ONE BIG THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:14.711
MISSING- AND THAT IS A VERY MUCH

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.346
A PART OF THIS PICTURE IS

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:19.082
BIOMASS AND REALLY INCENTIVIZING

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:22.018
BIOMASS PLANTS- BECAUSE YOU CAN

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:24.554
YOU CAN GET IN THERE AND DO THE

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.455
WORK OF. REMOVING THE BRUSH AND

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:28.558
THE- AND THE DEAD AND DYING

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:31.261
TREES BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:32.896
PLACE TO TAKE IT. AND THE

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:35.131
REALITY IS NOW WE HAVE WE DO NOT

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.300
HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO TAKE THAT

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:39.202
WOULD YOU WASTE AND DO SOMETHING

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:40.970
WITH IT THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:42.238
WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE RIGHT

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:45.442
NOW- WE HAD SIXTY SIX BIOMASS

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:52.315
PLANTS- AT. SO WE'VE LOST IT TWO

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:54.784
THIRDS OF THAT CAPACITY TO TAKE

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:57.153
THIS ON SO WHAT FIFTEEN NINETEEN

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.055
DOES IT PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE.

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.156
TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE ARE GOING

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:02.025
TO HAVE BIOMASS FACILITIES THAT

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.893
CAN TAKE IN THIS WAY IS THE

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.562
BIGGEST COST DRIVER AND HERE'S

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:06.830
HOW IT WORKS RIGHT NOW A LOT OF

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:09.099
TIMES BY MASS. IS OPERATING TO

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:11.701
PRODUCE ELECTRICITY- BUT THEY

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.336
ONLY GET PAID SO MUCH FOR THAT

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.338
ELECTRICITY PRODUCED IT'S NOT

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:16.973
ENOUGH TO COVER THE COSTS. AND

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.775
ONE OF THE BIGGEST COST DRIVERS

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:21.644
IS TRANSPORTATION IT'S GETTING.

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:24.447
YOU KNOW THE- THIS WOULD BE WAYS

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:26.049
FROM THE FORCE VERY REMOTE

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:29.686
AREAS- TO THE BIOMASS PLANTS. I

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:31.287
LOOK I WANT TO WORK ON US

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.089
GETTING MANY OF THESE BIOMASS

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:34.357
PLANTS IN THESE AREAS IN THESE

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.059
COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S ALSO PART

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:38.094
OF THIS BECAUSE THIS COULD HELP

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:40.864
INCENTIVIZE THAT- BUT WE NEED TO

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.332
ENSURE THAT WE'RE INCENTIVIZING

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:44.467
AGAIN AND- RATING THE

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:45.301
OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE THESE

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:49.606
BIOMASS PLANTS. TO BE CREATED-

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.407
AND HERE'S THE ALTERNATIVE AND

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:52.742
THIS IS THE REALITY THAT WE'RE

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:54.844
FACING RIGHT NOW IS IF WE ARE

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:57.914
NOT TAKING THIS WOULD BE WASTE.

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.315
TO BIOMASS FACILITIES IS EITHER

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:01.284
GOING TO BE OPEN BURNED IN A IN

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:02.819
A FIRE WHICH IS THE WORST

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:05.855
ALTERNATIVE AND LAST YEAR ALONE

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.457
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:08.958
OF CARBON- WERE EMITTED INTO OUR

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.360
ATMOSPHERE BY DEVASTATING

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.295
WILDFIRES IT KEEPS GETTING APPAN

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:16.232
ACTUALLY BIGGER- FOR THEY'RE

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.067
JUST GONNA BE LEFT AS A BRUSH

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:21.037
PILE SOMEWHERE ON SOME PROPERTY-

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:24.607
A RECENT. STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:26.643
AS COMPARED TO THOSE

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:31.414
ALTERNATIVES- BIOMASS A FACTUAL

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:33.683
ENSURES THAT AT BIOMASS ENERGY

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.652
GENERATION RESULTS IN NINETY

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.620
EIGHT TO NINETY PERCENT. 99%

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:41.124
LOWER PM TWO FIVE- THAT CARBON

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:43.092
MONOXIDE METHANE AND BLACK

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.594
CARBON EMISSIONS COMPARED TO

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:46.529
OPEN PILE BURNING. WILL BE DOING

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:48.898
A SUBSTANTIAL THING FOR THE

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.934
CLIMATE BY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.736
THESE BIOMASS FACILITIES- IN

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:57.207
PLACE NOW I'VE- AND THIS IS

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:58.908
WHERE I WANT TO TALK TO MY

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:00.310
FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS I

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:01.010
REALLY THINK WE CAN GET

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:03.246
SOMEWHERE ON THIS BILL. AND I AM

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.681
COMMITTED TO TAKING AMENDMENTS

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:05.682
THAT ADDRESS THE TWO PRIMARY

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:06.916
ISSUES BROUGHT UP IN THE

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:09.118
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ONE WAS THAT

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.753
THESE WOULD NOT BE.

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.555
INCENTIVIZING BIOMASS IN AREAS

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:15.491
WHERE WE HAVE NON ATTAINMENT I'M

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:16.626
I'M AGREEABLE TO TAKEN THAT

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:19.162
AMOUNT- AND A LOT OF THESE AREAS

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:20.897
WERE WERE TRYING TO GET MORE

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.332
BIOMASS. MOST OF MY DISTRICT IS

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:25.034
ENTERTAINMENT RIGHT NOW- MANY OF

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.736
THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO BRING

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:28.571
ON NEW BIOMASS PLANTS THERE IN.

WITHOUT PARAMOUNT'S DISABILITIES

01:02:56.906 --> 01:03:01.043

YOUR CONCERN. IS THAT IF WE

DON'T SUBSIDIZE THIS AND HAVE

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.666
THIS GO INTO A BIOMASS FACILITY

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:22.237
- THAT- BROSH DEAD AND DYING

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:23.906
TREES THAT WE THAT WE CUT DOWN

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:25.774
AND THEN NOW IT HAS NOWHERE TO

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.043
GO WHICH MEANS IT WILL EITHER

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.978
JUST BE LEFT THERE ON THE FOURTH

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.881
FLOOR. OR IT WILL BE. SENT TO A

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:34.917
PLACE WHERE THEY OPEN BURN IT.

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:37.252
IN WHICH CASE IN EITHER CASE

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:39.588
THAT'S A MUCH WORSE RESULTS. FOR

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:42.458
THE ENVIRONMENT- BECAUSE ONCE

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.626
THAT'S BURNED YOU KNOW THIS THE

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.328
STUDY THAT IT WAS REFERENCE UC

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.297
BERKELEY UC DAVIS. HAS SAID

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:53.402
THAT'S YOU KNOW 9899% MORE PM

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.237
THAT'S GOING INTO THE AIR- IT'S

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:58.674
GOING INTO THE AIR SO- I THINK

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.676
WE ALL AGREE WE GOT TO GET THAT

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:02.678
STUFF OUT OF THE FORCE CAUSES IT

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.179
MAKES IT. SO MUCH MORE FIRE

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:06.548
PRONE BUT OUR PROBLEM IS YOU

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.083
GOTTA GET IT SOMEWHERE TO WHERE

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.185
IT'S GOING TO BE DISPOSED OF

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:12.454
AND- IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.789
AND THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE WE

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.591
HAVE RIGHT NOW IS BIOMASS NOW.

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.493
THE TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING BETTER

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.194
TOO I MEAN THE TECHNOLOGY CAN

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.262
BETTER WHERE WE CAN ALTERNATELY

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:23.332
HAVE PLANTS COME ONLINE THAT

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:25.067
HAVE THAT ARE ZEROING BETTERS-

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:28.337
AND SO. I THINK IT IS JUST LIKE

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:29.705
WITH MANY THINGS WE'VE DONE

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.039
LET'S MAKE THE INVESTMENT LET'S

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:33.175
MAKE THE INVESTMENT NOW SO THAT

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.743
WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THIS

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.079
HAS A MUCH BETTER PLACE TO GO

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:37.713
THAN THAN THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.815
I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE IS NOT

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:41.850
GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. IF I

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:46.054
MAY IF I MAY FOLLOW UP THE GO

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:50.826

BIOMASS FACILITY WITH- THE

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.443
STRINGENT EMISSION CONTROL

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:09.545
TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT YOU'RE

THE BILL ANALYSIS- IN THERE

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:32.201
THERE WAS A- WORKING GROUP

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.735
ESTABLISHED ON EXPANDING WOULD

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.504
PRODUCT MARKETS AND THERE WAS

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:38.640
ALSO A BILL- BY. OUR COLLEAGUE

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:41.176
MS AGUIAR-CURRY AYE AND TWENTY

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:42.945
EIGHTEEN- IT TOO TO FURTHER

PRODUCT MARKETS- YEAH EIGHT

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:56.091
INADEQUATE. TO- YOU KNOW AVOID

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:59.962
THE ALTERNATIVE THAT I AGREE IS

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:03.031
NOT TO ENVIRONMENTALLY- FRIENDLY

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:06.635
THEY THE OPEN PILE BURNING- IT'S

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.604
PART OF IT I MEAN THAT'S

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:09.571
DEFINITELY PART OF IT IS THAT

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:12.341
MARKET- AND I THINK THAT'S

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.443
HELPFUL I MEAN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:16.545
BUDGET ACTUALLY ALSO OUTLINES- I

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.513
BELIEVE IT'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.316
FOR TRANSPORTATION- SO THAT'S IN

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:22.551
LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.352
ABOUT YOUR TRANSPORTATION OF

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:26.955
WOODY. BIOMASS FUELS- SO THIS

THAT IS YET DEFINITELY WANT TO.

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.996
WORK ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:36.198
THAT BUT I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:37.499
IS I THINK IT DOVETAILS AND

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.401
REALLY NICELY WITH WHAT WE'RE

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.470

BUT THE PROBLEM IS JUST PAT THE

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.445

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.327
OF IT IS. DUE TO PROGRAMS THAT

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.162
WE DID IN CAP AND TRADE WE

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.064
ACTUALLY HAVE A- REAL BOSSED.

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:45.567
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THAT'S

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:48.436
COMING OFF OF DAIRIES NOW. AND

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:49.704
THAT'S ACTUALLY FEELING THESE

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:52.574
TRUCKS AND A LOT AREAS. SO

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.809
YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING.

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:55.944
SOME OF THESE MODELS THAT WE

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:58.046
BUILT OUT AND OTHER SIDES OF

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:00.582
GREENHOUSE GAS AND OF CAP AND

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:01.249
TRADE ON WITH THESE OTHER

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:01.883
PROGRAMS THAT CAN NOW ACTUALLY

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.252
HOLD THIS STUFF SO TO SAY THAT

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.320
IT'S- ONLY DIESEL FUELS. IS

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:08.523
INCORRECT. WE HAVE OTHER. HEAVY

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.292
EQUIPMENT TRUCKS THAT ARE

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.394
RUNNING OFF OF RENEWABLE NATURAL

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:17.532
GAS. SO THEY ANY GETS PAST TIME

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.567
WE STOP USING THE ARGUMENT OF

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:21.369
IT'S ONLY BEING HAULED BY DIESEL

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:25.340
BECAUSE OF INCORRECT- THIS HAS

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:29.477
TO GET DONE. EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:31.980
MY DISTRICT WE WERE HAVE IN

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:34.115
FOREST FIRES AND IT WAS RAINING

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:35.383
ASHES ON US BEFORE IT WAS SEXY

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.986
AND HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE IN

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:39.888
OTHER AREAS. THIS IS SOMETHING

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:42.290
THAT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR. CLICK

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:45.427
INTEL WE ACTUALLY GO IN AND DO

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:46.895
WITH THIS BILL INTENDS TO DO AND

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:49.397
GET THIS WASTE OUT. OF OUR

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:53.435
FOREST. IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.036
TO HAPPEN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:56.371
TO HAVE AIR QUALITY SHOULD WE'RE

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.639
GONNA THE THESE THINGS ARE GOING

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:58.940
TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN SO THEN

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:00.041
WE'RE GONNA HAVE INCREASED COSTS

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.344
ON THE HEALTHCARE- SIDE. AND

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:07.082
EVERYWHERE ELSE. WE'VE SEEN IT.

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:08.950
SO SIT HERE AND ARE YOU IS THIS

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:11.486
THE RIGHT PLACE TO DO IT SHOULD

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:13.455
BE A BUDGET ASK FOR SHOULD WE DO

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:15.490
THIS WE DO THIS OF ALL TIME. ON

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:17.926
THE WATERFRONT. I KNOW HOW MANY

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:19.694
BILLS WE HAVE ALL PASSED IN THE

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.629
LAST THREE YEARS. THEY DO GREAT

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.098
PROGRAMS TO HELP WITH WATER

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.966
QUALITY ISSUES. BUT THEN ON THE

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.435
BUDGET SIDE WE TURN AROUND AND

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:28.403
ALL MONIES ARE PUT INTO THE

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:30.405
PROGRAMS. SO THAT PEOPLE IN MY

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:32.774
DISTRICT DON'T HAVE GOOD QUALITY

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.276
WATER. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FUND.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:39.247
THIS IS A POLICY BILL. THAT

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:41.249
CLEANS UP THE AIR QUALITY IN THE

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:44.519
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:46.254
PROVEN STUDIES FROM MULTIPLE

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:51.359
LABS. THAT SHOW. THIS IS A

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:54.095
BETTER WAY TO DISPOSE OF THE

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.063
MATERIAL THAT'S WHAT THIS IS

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.298
ABOUT HUMAN IT TOOK TO BURNING

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:59.601
RAIN ASHES ON YOUR CONSTITUENTS

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:02.437
PRETTY WANNA DISPOSE OF IT IN

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:05.607
THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. I MOVE

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:06.941
THAT WE DISPOSE OF IT IN THE

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:09.277
BEST WAY POSSIBLE MISTER GALLERY

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:12.947
THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL. MISTER

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:15.950
WHAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:18.953
JUST A JUST A FEW COMMENTS- I

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.289
DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:23.591
CLOSE. WHAT THE AUTHOR IS

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:25.827
OFFERING GETS YOU TO WHERE THE

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.229
PREVIOUS BILL WAS- COUPLE OF

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:31.433
YEARS AGO I DON'T MY MEMORY

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:32.233
ISN'T THAT GOOD. SO WHAT THAT'LL

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.768
LOOK LIKE BUT BUT I THINK IS A

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:35.203
KEY THING THERE THAT THAT'S

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.005
MEANT WAS MENTIONED AND THAT

01:24:37.071 --> 01:24:39.040
HE'S HE'S ASKING FOR THIS TO NOT

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.875
BE ALLOWED IN IN NON ATTAINMENT

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:43.044
AREAS SO- I THINK THAT'S A

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:44.612
SIGNIFICANT LOOK I DON'T

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.481
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS.

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:48.082
RESISTANCE TO BIOMASS IN SOME

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:50.652
AREAS BECAUSE OF HOW IT'S DONE-

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:53.354
BUT I LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:55.857
THAT IS AN ATTAINMENT AND- YOU

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.792
KNOW WE'VE BERMAN WE'VE LOST A

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.093
COUPLE MILLION ACRES IN THE LAST

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.896
THREE OR FOUR YEARS- WENT WHEN

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:03.264
THOSE FIRES HAPPEN. THE FIRES

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:06.434
HAPPENED- ALL THE FOLKS TO THE

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.570
SOUTH OF US AND IN SACRAMENTO

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:10.772
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY-

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:13.408
THE THAT THEY GET THE BRIEF- I

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:14.809
WISH THEY MIGHT COME AND VISIT

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.277
US DURING SOME OF THESE FIRES

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:17.378
AND EXPERIENCE. WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:19.113
ON THE GROUND TO BITS OF DEBRIS

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.983
THAT AIR QUALITY- AND- AND

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.118
RECOGNIZE THAT. IF WE CONTINUE

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:25.820
DOWN THE PATH WE'RE GOING. ON

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:26.888
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.289
HAPPEN YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:30.158
YEAR. SO HERE WE ARE MAKING

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:31.226
CONCERTED EFFORTS TO DO

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:33.094
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. BUT HAVE

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.796
NO WHERE TO TAKE THE VEGETATE

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:36.664
THE MET THE VEGETATION IS BEEN

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:40.635
MANAGE- AND THAT IS THAT IS

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:42.570
PROBLEMATIC- WOULD NEED TO HAUL

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:45.173
THIS AS FAR IF WE HAD MORE. WE

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.541
COULD REACTIVATE SOME OF THE

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:48.543
EXISTING BY MAP BIOMASS PLANTS

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.779
THAT HAVE. BEEN CLOSED OVER THE

01:25:51.846 --> 01:25:52.747
YEARS. THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.115
ISSUE. WHEN YOU DO SOME OF THIS

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.049
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHAT'S

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.684
ALSO NOT BEING CONSIDERED HERE

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:59.988
IS THAT- IT ALLOWS THE FORCE TO

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:01.689
BECOME HEALTHIER. WHICH ALLOWS

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:04.459
THE TREES TO BECOME BIGGER.

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:05.627
WHICH ALLOWS US TO SEQUESTER

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.362
MORE CARBON. THERE IS AN

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:09.664
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO WHAT

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:11.766
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE LEAVING

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.601
THE FUELS ON THE FOREST FLOOR.

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.670
LEADS TO METHANE RELEASE OVER

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:18.439
TIME ALSO IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.608
FUEL SOURCE FOR ADDITIONAL FIRES

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:23.778
IN THE FUTURE. IT ISN'T AN

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.280
EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE ENERGY.

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.814
IT WON'T BE AN EFFICIENT WAY TO

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.750
PRODUCE ENERGY. AND WE SHOULDN'T

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:30.418
BE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY I

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:31.753
THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AND BE

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.288
LOOKING AT THIS AS A LARGER

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:35.990
SOCIETAL BENEFIT. IS IT DO WE

01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:39.294
REALLY WANT OUR CHILDREN. AND R.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.296
AND A AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:42.764
FRAIL TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:46.634
BRIEF- PARTICULAR MATTER PM

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:47.802
TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE WHICH IS

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:49.804
REALLY REALLY UNHEALTHY. DO WE

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:52.874
REALLY WANT THAT. OR DO WE WANT

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.542
TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER THINGS

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:55.643
RECOGNIZING THAT THAT THERE ARE

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.346
COMPROMISES THAT THERE ARE.

01:26:58.413 --> 01:27:00.148
THERE THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS

01:27:00.214 --> 01:27:02.317
NO PERFECT SOLUTION WE DON'T

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:03.751
HAVE THAT PERFECT SOLUTION YET.

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:06.821
AND SO- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.557
BILL TODAY- I BELIEVE- IT'S IN

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:10.491
THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:12.927
DISTRICT I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:15.129
THAT I REPRESENT. AND- I HOPE

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:16.698
THAT TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:27:16.764 --> 01:27:17.832
PROCEDURE LEAVE IF HE'S NOT WHAT

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.702
HE'S OFFERING WORKS FOR YOU AS A

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:21.903
CHAIR- BUT- I'M NOT TO SHARE

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:24.505
THIS WITH SO ANYWAY THANK YOU.

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:26.841
THANK YOU MR WET AND- YOU KNOW

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:28.376
THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER FOR

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:31.212
PRESENTING THIS BILL- YOU KNOW

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:34.282
I. WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:38.019
BILL TODAY- MAINLY BECAUSE- I

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.288
BELIEVE THAT DID YOU ARE A FUNDS

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:41.489
SHOULD BE USED TO REDUCE

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.291
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:46.394
WHAT THIS BILL IS PROPOSING. IS

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.630
TO SUBSIDIZE THE TRUCKING OF

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:51.132
THIS MATERIAL PUT PERHAPS LONG

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:55.069
DISTANCES- AND YOU KNOW I FEEL

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:56.137
LIKE IT'S MOVING IN THAT PROBLEM

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.072
SOMEWHERE ELSE. RIGHT THEY ARE

01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:01.576
QUALITY ISSUES- I THINK THIS

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:04.212
COULD BE MORE. PROPERLY A BUDGET

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:06.781
REQUEST OF LIKE- I THINK SOMEONE

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:10.385
ELSE MENTIONED ARE AND- YOU KNOW

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.753
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS A

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:13.721
CHALLENGE WITH. BIOMASS

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:17.525
TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION- BUT-

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:19.093
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.728
SOLUTION AND IF IT'S NOT ONE

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.030
THAT I CAN SUPPORT AND I KNOW

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:23.965
PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT. THIS

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:25.366
BILL WAS PRESENTED AN AMENDED IN

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:27.135
THE PAST I WASN'T THE CHAIR AT

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.870
THE TIME AND I DIDN'T SERVE ON

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:31.706
THE COMMITTEE. ARE AND SO I MADE

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:34.609
THIS DECISION- TO NOT SUPPORT

THIS BILL TODAY- AND- YOU I HOPE

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:40.281

COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR PASSION.

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:46.721
FOR SERVING THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:48.890
HAVE SUFFERED MOST FROM

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:51.225
WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE- BUT I

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:55.496
WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING TODAY.

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:58.332

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:29.030
THESE THESE CANNOT BE APPLIED TO

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:31.099
BIOMASS PLANTS THAT ARE IN NON

01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:59.360
THAT AMENDMENT I THINK THAT

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:01.696
ADDRESSES WE'RE NOT ADDING. NEW

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:04.098
POLLUTANTS INTO AN AREA THAT'S

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:06.400
ALREADY IN NON ATTAINMENT- I

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:07.935
WOULD ALSO TAKE THE AMENDMENT

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:10.805
WOULD ASK IS A I HAVE AN

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:13.775
AMENDMENT THAT TO. AND THAT SAYS

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:16.444

WHICH CASE AND THEY COULD APPLY

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.122
AT THAT POINT. SO THOSE

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.457
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REALLY ASK

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:30.792
FOR YOUR SUPPORT MOVE FOR AND ON

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:33.361
THE ON THE TRUCKING SAID JUST

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:35.096
ASK YOU TO CONSIDER I MEAN. YOU

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:37.298

HOMES THEY'RE TRUCKED IN HERE

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:46.407
WOULD DIESEL TRUCKS. OKAY WE

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:47.975
BRING IN THE BIG WINDMILL

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:50.545

THEY'RE TRUCKED IN BY DIESEL

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.615
TRUCKS. NOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:57.185
FACT OF WHAT IS MOVING IN ALL

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:59.387
KINDS OF GOODS. IN CALIFORNIA

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:02.256
BUT WHAT I CAN DO IN THIS IS I

01:31:02.323 --> 01:31:04.225
THINK THE- IT'S A BIT OF A RED

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:05.092
HERRING BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:06.427
THE TRUCKING IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:08.396
THE BIOMASS FACILITY ITSELF

01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:10.565
WHICH IS WHERE THAT. WOODY

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:11.999
BIOMASS IS DISPOSED OF IN THE

01:31:12.066 --> 01:31:13.401
MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:15.036
WAY AND WE GOT IT WE HAVE TO

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:16.771
INVEST IN THAT TECHNOLOGY WE

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:18.039
NEED TO MAKE IT EVEN BIGGER LIKE

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.841
WE HAVE DONE. IN OTHER ASK

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.943
AVENUES AND THIS WOULD DO THAT.

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.277
THIS WOULD BE THAT INCENTIVE

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:25.580
THAT WOULD BUILD MORE THESE

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:26.647
BIOMASS PLANTS BECAUSE THEN THE

01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:29.116
COST. IT WORKS OUT. THEN IF YOU

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.451
HAVE SOMEBODY HELPING SUBSIDIZE

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:31.819
THE COST OF THE TRANSPORTATION

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:33.788

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.895
THE OPPOSITION- I THINK THAT

01:53:55.962 --> 01:53:57.964
THESE ARE VICTIMS AND THAT THAT

01:53:58.031 --> 01:53:59.299
THEY SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO

STILL STANDING THEY WOULD NOT BE

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:18.985
FACING THIS KIND OF A DECISION.

01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:21.354
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:22.689
BETWEEN UPGRADING. OR LEAVING

01:54:22.755 --> 01:54:24.924
THE COMMUNITY OUT OR THE AREA.

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:27.227

CHANGES TO NET ENERGY METERING

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:44.244
THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:45.945
VICTIMS ALREADY DO NOT HAVE

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:47.413
ENOUGH INSURANCE. TO COVER THE

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.650

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:30.000
DIRECTLY AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY

02:33:30.067 --> 02:33:31.435
WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:32.937
CONSEQUENCES OF SOMETHING THAT

02:33:33.003 --> 02:33:34.972
HAPPENED UPSTREAM. IN ANY CASE

02:33:35.039 --> 02:33:38.642
WATER. TWO THINGS- I THINK IF

02:33:38.709 --> 02:33:39.944
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING UP STREAM

02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:41.845
IT WOULD BE DEALT WITH UP THERE

02:33:41.912 --> 02:33:42.980
AND SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE

02:33:43.047 --> 02:33:45.015
PROBLEM AND THE DISADVANTAGED

02:33:45.082 --> 02:33:46.750
COMMUNITY. I COMMUNITY GETS A

02:33:46.817 --> 02:33:48.252
LOT OF THEIR GROUNDWATER A LOT

02:33:48.319 --> 02:33:49.720
OF THE WATER FROM GROUNDWATER-

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:50.988
AND A LOT OF THE POLLUTION

02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:51.855
THAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS

02:33:51.922 --> 02:33:54.625
ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO THE WE'RE

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:55.225
HAVING TO TURN OFF WEALTH AND

02:33:55.292 --> 02:33:57.261
IMPORT- MORE WATER WHICH IS MUCH

02:33:57.328 --> 02:33:58.562
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A

02:33:58.629 --> 02:33:59.296
SUSTAINABLE OUT THERE. I THINK

02:33:59.363 --> 02:34:00.931

IT IS ALL INTERCONNECTED. OUT

02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:52.029
THERE AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S

- AT. WORK CAN CONTINUE TO BE

02:37:54.932 --> 02:37:56.867

ALRIGHT WITH CHAIR WOULD LIKE

02:38:11.315 --> 02:38:12.082
THE CHAMBER TO CLARIFY SOME OF

02:38:12.149 --> 02:38:14.218
THEIR OPPOSITION AS RELATES TO

02:38:14.284 --> 02:38:14.985
THAT. EXAMPLE I THINK IT IS

02:38:15.052 --> 02:38:16.053
IMPORTANT TO GET THAT

02:38:16.119 --> 02:38:17.387
CLARIFICATION- IF ADAM COULD

02:38:17.454 --> 02:38:20.090
EVER SO BRIEFLY- ADDRESS THAT.

02:38:20.157 --> 02:38:21.325
BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:38:21.391 --> 02:38:23.327
THEIR REAL QUICK. AND BECAUSE IN

02:38:23.393 --> 02:38:25.128
MY DISTRICT WE TEND TO DEAL WITH

02:38:25.195 --> 02:38:27.030
A LOT OF THE BAY AREA ISSUES AS

02:38:27.097 --> 02:38:28.699
WELL. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:30.701
THE ONLY STEP DOWNSTREAM. IT IS

02:38:30.767 --> 02:38:33.670
A VERY- IMPORTANT. QUESTION

02:38:33.737 --> 02:38:35.138
BECAUSE ONE OF OUR OTHER MAJOR

02:38:35.205 --> 02:38:36.006
ISSUES IN THE CENTRE DOLLARS

02:38:36.073 --> 02:38:37.975
HOUSING. SO IF WE'RE EALING

02:38:38.041 --> 02:38:40.410
WITH OUR PROBLEMS PLUS THE BAY

02:38:40.477 --> 02:38:42.446
AREA PROBLEMS AND THAT CAN BE

02:38:42.512 --> 02:38:44.414
USED TO. STALL IN HOUSE PROJECT

02:38:44.481 --> 02:38:46.016
. IT IS A PROBLEMATIC SO THIS

02:38:46.083 --> 02:38:48.452
IDEA THAT IT IS CONNECTED. IT'S

02:38:48.518 --> 02:38:50.053
ABSOLUTELY CONNECTED AND I WOULD

02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:52.189
JUST- ENCOURAGE US TO THINK

02:38:52.256 --> 02:38:53.891
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- THOUGH WE

02:38:53.957 --> 02:38:55.826
MAY BE FIXING THE PROBLEM HERE

02:38:55.893 --> 02:38:57.628
OR THERE. IT'S CREATING ANOTHER

02:38:57.694 --> 02:38:59.363
ONE AND SO IF WE COULD JUST HAVE

02:38:59.429 --> 02:39:01.298
ADAM JUST CLARIFY HIS REMARKS

02:39:01.365 --> 02:39:03.367
AND- ALLEN JUST KEEP IT SHORT.

02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:05.669
SURE PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU

02:39:08.338 --> 02:39:09.673
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ASSEMBLY

02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:11.842
MEMBER BENNETT'S POINT THAT THE

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:13.243
AT THE MINIMUM TO CHECK THE

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:15.479
SPOKE TO IT BUT IN THE ACTUAL

02:39:15.545 --> 02:39:17.080
BILL SAYS THE A FACT SHALL BE

02:39:17.147 --> 02:39:19.049
MITIGATED DIRECTLY IN THE

02:39:19.116 --> 02:39:20.083
AFFECTED DISADVANTAGED

02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:21.718
COMMUNITIES MY POINT ABOUT WATER

02:39:21.785 --> 02:39:23.253
IS WE'RE NOT DRAWING WATER FROM

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:24.755
UNDERNEATH COMMUNITY. WHERE

02:39:24.821 --> 02:39:26.523
PROJECT MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A

02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:28.926
DISCHARGE YOU WANT TO GET IT AT

02:39:28.992 --> 02:39:30.494
OF SORTS THAT WE HUNDRED A MILE

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:31.628
UPSTREAM FROM THE COMMUNITY

02:39:31.695 --> 02:39:34.298
IMPACTED INFO AT POSTED ON THE

02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:35.899
COMMITTEE THE LANGUAGE MATTERS

02:39:35.966 --> 02:39:37.801
AND SO IF YOU REQUIRE THE

02:39:37.868 --> 02:39:39.236
MITIGATION TO BE DIRECTLY IN

02:39:39.303 --> 02:39:40.737
THAT COMMUNITY ARE NOT ACTUALLY

02:39:40.804 --> 02:39:42.372
STOP IN A POINT OF DISCHARGE SO

02:39:42.439 --> 02:39:44.374
IT ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S WORSE

02:39:44.441 --> 02:39:45.809
AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME. THE

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:49.313
DO IT ACTION THAT WOULD MEAN

02:39:49.379 --> 02:39:51.048
YOU'D HAVE TO. BUT THE PEOPLE

02:39:51.114 --> 02:39:52.683
HAVE Y. CREATED NEW. APPLE

02:39:52.749 --> 02:39:53.350
INTRICATE PLANT IN THE COMMUNITY

02:39:53.417 --> 02:39:55.052
TO CLEAN WATER THAT WHAT I. DO

02:39:55.118 --> 02:39:56.687
IN A MILE SOUTH THE PEOPLE

02:39:56.753 --> 02:39:58.388
IDENTIFIES. THE IMPACT. AND IT

02:39:58.455 --> 02:39:59.323
IT DIFFICULT THE MITIGATION TO
