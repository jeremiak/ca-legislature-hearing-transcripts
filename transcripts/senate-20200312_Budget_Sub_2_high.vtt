WHEN THOSE REQUESTS COMMAND WE

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.215
IDENTIFIED THE NEED BASED ON

THE LITTLE CREW THAT WE ALREADY

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:05.918

FURTHER- WE DO RAISE SOME

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.935
CONCERNS WITH THE LEVEL OF

BELIEVE THAT THE THOSE SCORES

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:03.094
ARE WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE BUT WE

00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:04.496

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:04.816
OKAY SO JUST JUST OVERALL THE

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.351
LEVEL OF SERVICE GORE'S WHAT WE

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:07.419
USE THAT FOR WITH AND PRIVATE

00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:08.887
TRANSPORTATION IS WAIT FOR

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:10.655
DIVISION MADE AS TO VALUE WAIT

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.857
HOW WE'RE MAINTAINING. VARIOUS

00:28:12.924 --> 00:28:13.758
ACTIVITIES ON THE STATE HIGHWAY

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.627
SYSTEM PART OF THAT INCLUDES

00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:17.495
VEGETATION CONTROL TREE AND

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:19.597
SHRUB CLEAN UP CAT. SO THOSE

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:20.965
LITTLE SERVICE SCORES RANGE

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:23.201
FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED AND WE

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:24.636
IDENTIFY THOSE SCORES BASED ON

00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:26.471
WHETHER OR NOT IT PASSES

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:27.772
THERE'S A NEED ORDERS A DIRE

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:30.575
NEED NOR FOR CLEANUP SERVICES

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:30.975
THAT CONTROLS THE

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:33.812
PRIORITIZATION. ON WHAT WORKS

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.346
CAN BE DONE. IT'S BASICALLY A

00:28:35.413 --> 00:28:37.415
SNAPSHOT IN TIME BETWEEN MARCH

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:39.584
AND AUGUST A WHAT IS NEEDED.

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:41.586
ADD WOULD BASICALLY WE'RE

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.188
TRYING TO DO IS EVALUATE A

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:45.423
SECOND PORTION OF THE HIGHWAY.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.925
ONE MILE SEGMENTS VERY DETAIL

00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:48.660
YOU KNOW I WOULD TRY TO CUT IT

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:51.396
COVERS THAT 20% OF THE- AREA

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.398
FOR EVERY REGIONAL EVERY THAT

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:54.899
WE ARE WE MAINTAIN. WITH THAT

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:57.836
SAID WE USE THOSE SCORES TO

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.504
PRIORITIZE THE VEGETATION AND

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.073
IS TO BE DONE NOW. THE LEVEL

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.608
SCORES MAY BE DECLINING A

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:04.742
LITTLE BIT FOR THE PAST COUPLE

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:06.211
YEARS MAILINGS BECAUSE WE'VE

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:08.246
BEEN RDIRECTING OUR RESOURCES

00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:10.448
FOR WILDFIRE EFFORTS WHICH IS

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:11.883
THE PRIMARY CONCERN FOR OUR

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.485
SAFETY PURPOSE FOR THE GENERAL

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.520
PUBLIC AND TO TRY TO PREVENT

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:17.622
WILDFIRES FROM OCCURRING. THE

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:19.057
WHOLE LEVEL OF SERVICE SCORE

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:20.525
HOWEVER IS CONTROLLED BY THE

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.127
VEGETATION FROM THE STATEWIDE

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:25.396
EFFORT OKAY AND SO. THERE COULD

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:26.498
BE SOME AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T

00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:28.099
POSE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:30.568
MOTORING PUBLIC OR TO A SAFETY

00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:32.537
CONCERNS ON THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.839
THE MORE COSMETIC IN NATURE.

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.074
CONSEQUENTLY WE WANT TO DRESS

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.275
THOSE BECAUSE THE PRIORITIES

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.710
MORE TOWARDS THE SAFETY AEAS

00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:40.645
OF THAT DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.647
WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHER AREAS

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.015
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.984
VEGETATION. IN ORDER TO MAKE

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.252
SURE THE SAFETY IS THERE

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.786
ANYTHING WITH THESE COSMETIC

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:51.289
AREAS WOULD THEY HAVE A LOWER

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:53.158
SCORE OR WITH THE I MEAN

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:54.459
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:55.894
ALLEY OF SUGGESTING SAID HOW DO

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.061
YOU. WOULD YOU GOT TO DO TO GET

00:29:57.128 --> 00:30:00.064
SCORES UP RIGHT NOW DO YOU HOW

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.599
DO YOU GET 290% THE WAY WE DO

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:02.867
THAT IS BASED ON THE CUSTOMER

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:03.601
SERVICE REQUEST THAT WE

00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:05.436
RECEIVE. THAT ADDRESS THE

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:06.838
PRIORITIZATION OF THE EFFORT

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:10.742
AND SO THE CAUSE MEDIC AREAS.

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:11.776
IT COULD BE A LIE IN URBAN

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:13.645
AREAS WHERE THE IMMEDIATE

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.580
THREAT IS NOT THERE HOWEVER. ON

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.115
PUBLIC PERCEPTION. THERE'S

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:18.249
STILL A LOT OF CONCERN THAT

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:19.117
THEY WANT THE VEGETATION

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:21.586
CONTROLLED RIGHTLY SO HOWEVER

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.887
BECAUSE OF THE PRIORITY AND THE

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:25.456
AND THE LACK OF OR- THE LOW

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:27.792
RISK AND SAFETY. BILL TRIED TO

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:29.127
SCORE DOWN BECAUSE THAT WORK IS

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:30.828
NOT AGAINST TO IT IMMEDIATELY

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:32.096

THE NEXT YEAR ROUND THE TAKE A

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:35.366
SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE ARE WHICH

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:36.834
AGAIN BRINGS LEVELS OF SERVICE

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.504

ARE IN FACT NOBODY'S CALLING

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:47.212

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:50.782

ONE WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:01.811
EFFORTS OF DEPARTMENT HEALTH

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.079
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE

LOCALS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:06.115
BUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:07.684
ADDRESSING THE ILLICIT OR BLACK

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.018
MARKET EFFORTS THAT ARE OUT

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:11.120
THERE LAST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:12.188
NINETEEN AND TWENTY PROPERTY

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:13.356
SIX AFFORD OVER THIRTY MILLION

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.691
DOLLARS THAT WAS AWARDED TO

00:58:14.757 --> 00:58:16.893
GRANTS OVER SEVENTY SIX

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.493
DIFFERENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.329
CALIFORNIA. THEIR EFFORTS

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:22.665
ALTHOUGH WHILE- IMPORTANT ARE

00:58:22.732 --> 00:58:23.933
FOCUSED ON REGULATORY

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.435
ENFORCEMENT- WHAT YOU'RE

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:26.402
TALKING ABOUT BY BUS WITH

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:28.037
MINORS WHICH ARE OTHERWISE

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.039
LEGAL- PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:31.808
BUYING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:33.977
BRIDGING THE GAP THAT FROM WHAT

00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:35.545
WE KNOW IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:37.413
IN THAT GAP WOULD BE WITH THE

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.715
ILLICIT. THE LEGAL THE BLACK

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:40.083
MARKET THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:42.385
THAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. AND

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:44.420
EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

00:58:44.487 --> 00:58:45.722
WHERE THE INJURIES THAT'S FOR

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:47.323
THE DESKS AND THAT'S WHERE THE-

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:50.994
THE PROBLEM LIES AS THE TAXES

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.528
AND LEGAL COMMODITIES ARE TAXED

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:54.097
WE BELIEVE THAT THE BLACK

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:55.365
MARKET MORE PEOPLE CAN BE

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:56.266
DRIVEN TOWARDS THAT SO THE

00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:58.835
PROBLEM ON THE BLACK MARKET THE

00:58:58.902 --> 00:58:59.402
LIST OF PRODUCTS ARE GONNA.

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:00.236
RISE THAT'S WHERE THE SIEGE BE

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.638
DOES HAVE EXPERT THAT'S YOU

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:04.874
KNOW LEVERAGING THE- THE SEVEN

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:05.508
THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE HIGHWAY

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:06.576
PATROL AND I KNOW WE DON'T WANT

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:08.845
ALL GOING TO BE AN EXPERT BUT

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:09.379
WE DO ON ALL OF THEM TO BE

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:10.513
FOCUSED ON THIS WE DO WANT ALL

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.347
OF THEM WHEN THEY'RE IN A

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:13.583
TRAFFIC STOP TO RECOGNIZE OKAY

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.585
THIS COULD BE. ILLEGAL PRODUCT

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:18.187
LAST YEAR WE RECOVERED OVER

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:18.821
FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS OF

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:21.491
ILLICIT DRUGS- I DON'T KNOW FOR

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:22.492
SURE BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:23.960
BET THAT THE LARGEST SEIZURE BY

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:25.461
ANYONE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE

00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:27.397
STATE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:28.431
WE WOULD TAKE OUR EXPERTISE

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:30.266
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GOING

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:31.301
INTO KEEPING A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.335
FROM BUYING A PRODUCT THAT

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:33.970
THOSE EFFORTS WITH THE LEGAL TO

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.471
DO MORE TALK ABOUT BRIDGING

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:36.639
THAT GAP. AND PERHAPS

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:37.807
INTERCEPTING SHIPMENTS

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:39.175
TRUCKLOADS COMING INTO OUR

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:41.744

TAKING ACTION ON AND- ILLICIT

00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:00.296
VAPING PRODUCTS IS LAUDABLE AND

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.631
GIVEN THE SERIOUS HEALTH

COULD INTERCEPT THOSE ILLEGAL

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:52.114

STREETS AND THOSE ARE WORTHY

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.921
EASILY OR THE- DANGEROUS

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:00.256

THAT UPON COMBUSTION BECOMES.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.547
YEAH ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.082
OUR FOCUS WOULD BE INSTEAD OF

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.883
GOING TO THE END OF THE ROW AND

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:28.751
GETTING THE END USER THAT'S

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:31.287
BUYING IT ILLEGALLY TO GOING TO

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:32.688
THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO DISRUPTING

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:33.856
THE CRIMINAL IN PRICE IT'S

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:35.257

IS THAT QUESTIONS WEATHERED CHP

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:54.143
IS THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY TO

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:57.313
LEAD THIS ANTENNA LISTED VAPING

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.383
NO EFFORT. GOVERNOR'S CHOSEN

CONTACTS THAT THEY HAVE TO THE

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:18.768
GENERAL IDEA IS THAT IF YOU

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.169
WERE TO PROVIDE. GRANTS TO

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.737
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- THEY

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.272

FEEL DIVISIONS EXCUSE ME IN.

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:36.051
THEN I THINK HERE IN

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.787
HEADQUARTERS- BUT A DIFFERENT

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:38.854
DIVISIONS SO YOU HAVE ONE

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:39.588
OFFICER IN EACH OF THOSE

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.490
DIVISIONS OF THE INITIAL PLAN

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.358
THE IDEA WOULD BE TO LEVERAGE

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.059
THOSE CONTACTS- THAT THE

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.429
OFFICERS MAKE IN THE FIELD. IF

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:47.062
AN OFFICER IDENTIFIES SOMETHING

THAT DIVISIONS THAT WE WOULD

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:55.671
HAVE A STATEWIDE PRESENCE

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.772
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.040
WHAT'S HAPPENING. I TO THE

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.041
ALEJO'S POINT THERE'S A LOT

THAT'S NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS AND

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.577
SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO BEGIN

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.412
TO GET A BASE OF UNDERSTANDING

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.113
AT THAT POINT MAKE BETTER

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:06.816
THE BEST A FORCE BEEN STRATEGY

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.350

ADDRESSED IN IN PRINCIPALLY AT

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.823
A HIGH LEVEL GOVERNANCE AND HOW

OBVIOUSLY THAT OFFER SOME

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:41.803
EFFICIENCY BUT WE ALSO PROVIDE

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:42.970
A CHECKS AND BALANCES BEFORE

MATCHES ALL THOSE THINGS THAT

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.881
GO ON. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAS

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:55.483
BEEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR US IS

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.618
THE PAPER PROCESS AND WE STILL

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:58.553
HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:00.388
RELY ON THE PAPER PROCESS AND

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:01.889
WHILE WE HAVE SCANNING SYSTEMS

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.858
WHICH YOU AFFORDED TO US- NOT

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:05.593
ALL SCANNING SYSTEMS PICKUP

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.795
WRITING THAT IS A LOGICAL OR

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:09.964
INFORMATION NOT COMPLETED AND

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:12.066

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.734
PROCESS YOU HAVE A CHANCE FOR

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.369
WHAT I CALL MORE ERRORS THAT

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:16.537
HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED SO IT

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:17.772
REALLY IS CREATED INCREDIBLE

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.841
WORKLOAD FOR US AND- AND WHILE

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.075
I WOULD TELL YOU IT'S A SMALL

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:23.144
FRACTION OF WHAT COMES THROUGH

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:24.679
IN OUR PROCESSING IT DRIVES

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.614
MOST OF THE MANUAL WORK. THAT

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:29.717
WE HAVE TO DO SO- THE POSITIONS

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:31.352
THAT WE ARE REQUESTING AS WE

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:31.919
HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE MOTOR

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:34.355
VOTER SYSTEM AND SO IT'S THE I.

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:35.790
T. KINDA MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:37.358
AT CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN IT WILL

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.260
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR IT

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:40.761
SYSTEMS PROVIDE THE MONITORING

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.630
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN IT- AND

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:43.698
THEN THERE'S THE PROCESSING AND

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:45.032
OUR REMITTANCE SECTION THAT

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:47.001
STILL. IS TAKING IN THIS PAPER

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:50.238
VOLUME- AND IN AGAIN WE DON'T

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:51.939
DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY BUT WE

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.975
TRY TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:55.142
THE DOCUMENTS WERE SENDING OVER

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.777
TO SECRETARY STATE SO THEY CAN

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.046
THEM PROCESS THOSE DOCUMENTS.

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.748
AND SENATOR I WOULD JUST ADD

01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:01.382
THAT DOES IT WOULD YOU HAVE THE

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:02.550
FEDERAL APARTMENTS FOR TEN AND

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:03.818
FIVE DAYS SO WE DON'T REALLY

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:05.019
HAVE A CHANCE TO GO BEYOND

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:06.254
THOSE TIME WISE WE HAVE TO

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.321
ENSURE THAT THOSE TWO WRITERS

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.090
ACTORS SO WHAT YOU'RE

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:14.228
DELIVERING OVER TO SECRETARY.

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:15.529
STATE HAS GOT TO BE. TYPE AND

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:16.530
AS C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. AS POSSIBLE.THE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:19.433
AROUND THEN THAT AND IT. IN

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.436
TIGHT SO. THE TEXT AND WE DID

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:24.138
WE DID DO A QUICK LOOK BACK AS

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:27.174
WE KIND OF. ALLEY SCUTTLED STAY.

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.142
INFECTED DURING THE PRIMARY. TO

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:30.344
ENSURE THAT HOW MUCH PERCENTAGE

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:31.178
OF OUR RECORDS ARE ACTUALLY

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:33.381
GOING OVER THERE. ABOUT 99%

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:33.981
THOSE RECORDS HAVE GONE OVER

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:35.049
AND THE ONLY REASON WHY MAY NOT

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:37.051
BE A HOW 2% AS AN EXAMPLE. IS

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:38.352
THAT WE DO HAVE SOME BUSINESS

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:40.021
PROCESSES IN PLACE SAY SOMEONE

01:32:40.087 --> 01:32:41.822
IS TRYING AS IS DECEASED AND

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.257
THEIR INFORMATION IS TRYING TO

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:46.260
COME THROUGH OUR- SYSTEM FOR

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:48.696
KICK THAT OUT. AS IF THE STATE

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:51.232
ARE AYE HERE'S- AB. THE NEED

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.200
PURSUE. BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.268
THOUGH THAT EVEN THOUGH

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:57.505
SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD DEMAND-

01:32:57.571 --> 01:33:00.074
ACTUALLY DO MORE WORK WITH

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:02.009
FEWER PEOPLE GOING FORWARD FROM

01:33:02.076 --> 01:33:03.311
THESE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:04.278

AND SO WE'RE GONNA AVE

01:33:06.747 --> 01:33:08.149
ENHANCED MONITORING WHICH WILL

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:08.950
