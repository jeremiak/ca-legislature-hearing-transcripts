TWO SEVENTY SIX IT MANDATES AS

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:54.713
MEDICAL EXEMPTION THEIR

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:55.947

PHYSICIAN IS GOING TO BE LOOKING

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:08.226
AT THE CDC GUIDELINES FOR MAKING

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:12.197
EXEMPTIONS -- WHICH TO ME IS --

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:13.465
MAYBE NOT AS COMPREHENSIVE AS IT

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:16.401
SHOULD BE.

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:17.202
AFTER TO RECEIVE THE STATE

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.903
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER WILL

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.505
REVIEW THE REQUEST.

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:22.240
FORMAN EITHER APPROVE OR DENY

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.742
THE EXEMPTION [inaudible]

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:27.012
SO.

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:28.480
WHAT WHY ARE WE HERE TODAY?

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:30.215
WE ARE HERE TODAY.

00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:32.117
BECAUSE A HANDFUL OF POSITIONS

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:34.386
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:37.055
HAVE ABUSED THEIR AUTHORITY.

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:38.890
AND THEIR POSITIONS [inaudible]

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.759
TO WRITE.

00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:43.194
NON LEGITIMATE EXEMPTIONS

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.497
[inaudible] FOR PATIENTS.

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:46.898
A MAJORITY OF PHYSICIANS THAT

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.500
ARE WRITING FOR EXEMPTIONS ARE

00:27:48.566 --> 00:27:49.267
DOING IT.

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.903
BASED ON THERE.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.905
MEDICAL TEACHINGS AND THEIR

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:58.109
VIEWPOINTS OF OF MEDICAL SCIENCE.

00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.878
THE DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN

00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:02.147
HAVING THE MEDICAL BOARD.

00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:04.049
ENFORCE THIS NEW LAW AS OPPOSED

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:06.151
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

00:28:06.217 --> 00:28:07.218
IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:09.287
CANNOT.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:12.791
SITE A PHYSICIAN THE CAMP.

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:14.092
BUT THERE LICENSE ON PROBATION

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.894
THEY CAN'T REVOKE.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.429
THE PRIVILEGES OF BEING A

00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:17.929
PHYSICIAN IF THEY'RE OUT

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:18.997
FOLLOWING GOOD [inaudible]

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.498
HIPPOCRATIC [inaudible]

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:23.501
BOTH.

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:25.303
SO THAT IS A CONCERN OF MINE I

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.538
THINK THE BILL IS A GOOD BILL.

00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:28.106
I'M CONCERNED THOUGH THAT IT

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.107
SHOULD BE THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.442
OVERSEES THIS AND WE SHOULD BE

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:32.977
WEEDING OUT THOSE BAD POSITIONS

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:33.344
THAT ARE.

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:35.146
JEOPARDIZING THE HEALTH AND

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:38.983
SAFETY OF OUR CONSTITUENCY.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.385
THIS DISCOVERY OF VACCINES IS

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.520
UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE GREATEST

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:45.423
MEDICAL ADVANCES OF ALL TIME.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.491
AND SECOND OUR STATE'S PUBLIC

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:47.859
HEALTH.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:51.296
MUST ALWAYS REMAIN A PRIORITY.

00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:53.164
BUT DESPITE THIS THE FACT THAT

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:55.166
SB TWO SEVENTY SIX GREATLY OVER

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:56.801
REACHES POWER THE STATE IS

00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:58.736
TROUBLING.

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.605
FIRST SB TWO SEVENTY SIX BREAKS

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:02.040
THE LEGISLATURE'S PROMISE WE

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:04.976
PROMISE WHEN WE DID SB TWO

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:05.577
SEVENTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND

00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:06.811
AND FIFTEEN THAT.

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.113
WE WOULD ALLOW FOR A MEDICAL

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.447
EXEMPTION SO THAT A PARENT OR

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:11.282
CHILD WHO HAS LEGITIMATE

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:11.816
CONCERNS CAN GET A MEDICAL

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:13.384
EXEMPTION.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:15.453
I GOT A MOTHER.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.523
BUT I SAW [inaudible] FOR DINNER --

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.859
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.127
THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMMUNE

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:24.095
DEFICIENCY [inaudible]

00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:27.632
AND SHE HAS EXEMPTIONS FOR HER

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:28.700
CHILDREN THAT SHE WILL NOT BE

00:29:28.766 --> 00:29:31.002
ABLE TO GET.

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:33.505
IF THIS LAW IS PASSED UNLESS

00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.507
THERE ARE AMENDMENTS TAKEN.

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:36.508
SHOULD THE BILL MOVE OFF THE

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:37.542
FLOOR AND INTO THE ASSEMBLY

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.077
WHICH I HOPE.

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.044
THAT THE AUTHOR WORKABLE

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.480
CONSIDER HER SITUATION SHE WANTS

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:44.182
TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA SHE WANTS

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.416
HER CHILDREN TO STAY.

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:49.020
IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS -- BUT MAY BE

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:50.588
FORCED TO BE MAY MAKING -- AN

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:52.624
IMPORTANT DECISION -- IF THIS

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.858
GOES THROUGH WITHOUT BEING

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:56.094
CHANGED.

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.263
MANY OF US VOTED FOR SB TWO

00:29:58.329 --> 00:29:58.930
SEVENTY SEVEN BECAUSE WE

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:00.598
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.633
VACCINATIONS.

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.835
CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:04.602
AND AGAIN IT'S MEDICAL

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:06.404
EXEMPTIONS.

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.173
SB TWO SEVENTY SIX DIRECTLY

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:09.073
UNDERMINES THE PREVIOUS

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.008
DECISIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:30:10.074 --> 00:30:10.975
MAKES US [inaudible]

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:12.343
LOOK LIKE.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.112
WE'RE GOING BACK ON A WORD.

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:15.847

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:18.383
AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:21.953
WE NEED TO KEEP YOUR WORK.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.889
THIS BILL MAKES ME.

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:27.992
A CO AUTHOR.

TO SEVENTY SEVEN LOOK LIKE I'M

00:30:28.693 --> 00:30:30.495

IN AN EMAILS.

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:36.634
I GET ACCUSED OF BEING A LIAR IF

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:40.572
I SUPPORT THIS BILL.

00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:42.040
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO AND

I APPLAUD HIM FOR THAT.

00:30:52.317 --> 00:30:53.618
IF THIS IS [inaudible]

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:56.120
THE CASE.

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:58.790
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE SHOWING SO?

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.291
IF THIS IS IN FACT THE CASE WHY

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:02.493
ISN'T THE MEDICAL BOARD DEALING

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.461
WITH THESE BAD ACTORS.

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:06.030
THESE.

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.465
INAPPROPRIATE ACTIONS BY THESE

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.133
POSITIONS.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.535
WHY ARE THEY NOT HAVING THEIR

00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:17.108
PROBE PUT ON PROBATION.

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.276

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:21.846
GOOD MEDICAL PRACTICE GETTING

THEIR LICENSES IN FACT WE VOTE.

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:26.918
IF BAD DOCTORS OF THE PROBLEM

THE BACK OFFERS MORE DISCIPLINE

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.654

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:31.656
BUT NOT AT THE COST OF LIFE AND

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:32.724
LIBERTIES OF FAMILIES AND

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.093

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:36.427
AS A PHARMACIST MY BIGGEST

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.663
PROBLEM WITH SB TWO SEVENTY SIX

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.664

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CREATE AND

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:49.674
KEEP A DATABASE.

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.042
WITH A CHILD'S NAME.

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:53.978
IN ALL MEDICAL RECORDS.

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.613
IN A SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD WHERE

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.848
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE MADE

00:31:56.914 --> 00:31:58.016
PUBLIC EVEN THINGS THAT ARE

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.684
MEANT TO BE MADE PRIVATE.

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:00.752
HEALTH MATTERS ESPECIALLY

MEDICAL RECORDS NOT ONLY DESERVE.

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:06.524
BUT ALSO LEGALLY WARRANT PRIVACY

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:07.659
IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK HER SCHOOL

DISTRICTS TO GET MEDICAL

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.894

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:11.129
OF OUR CHILDREN AND WHETHER THEY

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:12.063

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:16.701
I HOPE THAT AT THIS BILL MOVES

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.136
OFF THE FLOOR.

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:20.305
THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:21.406
WHICH SHOULD NOT BE OF INTEREST

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.507
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:24.375

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:25.743
AND IF NOTHING ELSE JUST THE

FORWARDED. TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.583
HEALTH.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.252
I THINK THAT THIS DATABASE THAT

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:36.387
IS BEING CREATED SB TWO SEVENTY

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.388
SIX COULD.

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:40.491
VERY WELL BE A VIOLATION OF HELP.

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:42.160
IT'S A GREAT OVERREACH OF

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:42.760
GOVERNMENT POWER IN ULTIMATELY

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.329
VIOLATES [inaudible]

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:45.596

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:49.534
COLLEAGUES.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.469
SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS A SLIPPERY

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.571
SLOPE PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:54.339
THE INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR ARE

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.474
GOOD.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:57.475
AND I THINK THAT IT CAN BE

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:00.011
ACCOMPLISHED.

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:03.014
BY EMPOWERING THE MEDICAL BOARD.

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:05.683
NOT PUTTING MANDATES

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.983
[inaudible]

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.618
ON SCHOOLS.

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:08.619
AND RELEASING OUR CHILDREN'S

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.788

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.223
THIS BILL IS UNPRECEDENTED AND A

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.991
DANGEROUS INTRUSION.

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:15.426
NOT ONLY INTO THE DOCTOR PATIENT

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.195
RELATIONSHIP.

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:18.629
BUT ALSO THE PERSONAL LIBERTIES

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:19.964
OF THE PARENTS.

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:23.701
AND THEIR CHILDREN.

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:24.869
AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:26.671

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.406
I SUPPORT WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:30.575
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT SB TWO

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:31.376

MENTION IN THE BILL.

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:40.478
MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:43.748
EXPANSIVE OR RESPONSIVE.

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:44.749
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR UPDATED.

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:47.452
BUT WE NEED.

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.086
A MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:51.222
THAT IS STILL IN THIS FRAMEWORK

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:53.357
TO BE SOLID AND DEPENDABLE AND

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:55.927
WORKABLE.

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:58.563
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT.

00:34:58.629 --> 00:35:01.165
THE CD PH REVIEW THAT THE BILL

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:02.934
ARTICULATES [inaudible]

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.304
IS THE UNWARRANTED INTRUSION IN

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.805
A DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.474
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE APPEALS

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.610
PROCESS THAT IT CONTAINS ALREADY.

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:14.345
AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:16.047
DOCTORS TO ASSERT THEIR CASE ON

00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:18.549
BEHALF OF THEIR PATIENTS.

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:20.785
IT IS TRUE THAT SOME PEOPLE

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:22.653
TRULY CAN'T DEAL WITH.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.322
ARE THESE VACCINATIONS AND FOR

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:26.090
THOSE PEOPLE I THINK THERE IS

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:28.726
RECOURSE IN HERE -- I THINK THAT

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.394
THE DOCTOR IS LOOKING DEEPER

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.796
INTO.

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:33.698
HOW TO THE CURRENT AND ACCURATE

00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:35.066
ABOUT?

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:38.402
THAT LIST -- I THINK IT'S A

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:41.038
TOUGH THE TOUGH.

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.607
NEEDLE TO THREAD BUT I THINK

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:44.108
YOU'VE DONE IT TODAY. FOR

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:45.376
PRESENT PURPOSES I'M VERY

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:46.811
SUPPORTIVE AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:52.717
WORK.

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:55.219
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:55.520
[inaudible]

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:56.721
SENATOR BRIDGES.

00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:58.890
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MAY I

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:01.292
POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR.

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:03.294
BE PREPARED FOR SESSION YES

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:07.164
MAYBE SEE.

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:10.067
I HEARD SOME COMMENTS FOR MY

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.836
STEAM REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE WITH

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.571
A BACKGROUND IN.

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:17.108
MEDICINE AND PHARMACEUTICAL

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:18.643
SCIENCE.

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:21.445
ANY BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT I

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.079
WANT TO JUST KIND OF FIGURED OUT

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.481
WITH YOU.

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:24.515
IS THERE A REASON WHY THE

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.784
APPELLATE BODY FOR THIS WOULD

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.353
NOT BE AT THE MEDICAL BOARD AS

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.855
OPPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:33.291
HEALTH.

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.659
SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY IS

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:38.029
IS THAT -- THERE'S TWO PROCESSES

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:38.696
AND I THINK WE SHOULD CAN'T

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.631
COMPLETE THE TWO SO THERE'S ONE

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:41.499
ABOUT WHETHER YOU.

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:42.867
IN TERMS THE GRANTING OF THE

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.402
MEDICAL EXEMPTION ITSELF AND IN

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:46.037
FACT THIS IS A PROCESS THAT

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.705
ACTUALLY IS BEING SUPPORTED BY

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:48.539
THE MEDICAL.

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.674
COMMUNITY AS I SAID THIS BILL

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.175

CALIFORNIA AMERICAN KHAKI AFTER.

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:56.180
THAT INTENSELY TAKES A

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:57.415
PREVENTIVE APPROACH NOW THIS

00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:01.052
BILL ALSO BY THE WAY ALLOWS THE

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:01.953
PROVIDES INFORMATION TO THE

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:02.820
MEDICAL BOARD TO CALIFORNIA'S

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.289

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:06.757
OF PURSUING IN TERMS OF BE ABLE

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.125
TO INVESTIGATE AND HAVING THAT

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.193
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:09.961
INVESTIGATE.

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.529
THE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE ACTING

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.730
UNPROFESSIONALLY IN FACT YOU

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.732

BEEN HAPPENING SINCE TWO SEVEN

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:22.239
SEVEN WAS PASSED.

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:23.274
THAT NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.675
THE MEDICAL BOARD THE MEDICAL

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.243
BOARD IS EXPRESSED THAT THEY ARE

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.278
CHALLENGED.

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:32.116
IN TRYING TO PURSUE THESE

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:33.451
POSITIONS BECAUSE THE MEDICAL

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:34.352
BOARD PROCESS GENERALLY REQUIRES

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:35.586
THE COOPERATION OF THE PATIENT

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:36.253
OR THE PATIENT'S FAMILY IF

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.021
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CHILD.

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.589
AND THESE FAMILIES ARE NOT

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:40.491
COOPERATING BECAUSE THEY'RE IN

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:41.459
CAHOOTS WITH THE POSITIONS THEY

00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:43.361
PAID FOR AND THEY WANTED TO

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:44.562
MEDICAL ATTENTION SO THEY PAID

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.330
FOR IT THEY'RE NOT ABOUT TO TURN

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:46.931
AROUND AD MEDICAL BOARD SAID

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:48.199

00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:49.367
SHARE THE INFORMATION ABOUT

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:49.700
WHAT'S GOING.

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.669
ON WITH THIS POSITION WHO IS

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:52.903
ACTING INAPPROPRIATELY FOR THE

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.071
MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF IS

00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:55.573
FRUSTRATED THEY ACTUALLY DID --

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.341
THE PLACE ONE POSITION WHO THEY

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:58.542
WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO FIND A

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.411
COOPERATIVE FAMILY WITH -- TO

DR BOB'S YEARS IN ORANGE COUNTY --

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:05.916
HE WAS ACTUALLY PUT ON PROBATION

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:06.617
FOR ISSUING AN APPROPRIATE

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:08.352
MEDICAL EXEMPTION BUT IT'S VERY

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:12.423
HARD. TO IDENTIFY GET A FAMILY

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.457
TO COOPERATE THE OTHER ISSUE IS

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:14.592
THIS CURRENTLY.

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:19.096
THE WAY THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:19.697
PROCESS WORKS CURRENTLY IS IS

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:22.366
THAT.

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:23.901
FAMILY GOES OF PHYSICIAN DAVE.

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.770

THEN THEY TAKE THEN IT GOES TO

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.438
THE SCHOOL THERE'S NO PLACE

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:28.005
WHERE THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:28.839
ACTUALLY GET A LIST OF ALL THE

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:30.508
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS UNLESS THE

SCHOOLS TURNED OVER AND BY THE

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:32.810
WAY WHEN THE SCHOOLS RIGHT

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.311
INFORMATION THEY DON'T PROVIDE

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:35.446
THE NAME OF THE PATIENTS.

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:36.714
WHO AFTER RECEIVED A MEDICAL

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:38.049
EXEMPTION SO THERE'S NO THE

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.684
MEDICAL BOARD IS FORCE THEN TO

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.286
SAY WELL WE KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:42.920
SAID?

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.488
THIS DOCTOR SO FOR EXAMPLE SAN

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:45.890
DIEGO ONE PHYSICIAN WROTE ALMOST

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:46.824
A THIRD OF ALL THE MEDICAL

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.492
EXEMPTIONS AND SAN DIEGO UNIFIED

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.393
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.828
FROM FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD IS IS

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:52.663
THAT THEY CAN'T GET THE LIST OF

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:53.931
THE NAMES OF THE PATIENTS IT IS

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.466
SO THEN WHAT THAT HAVE TO DO IS

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.500
THEY HAVE TO GO TO A COURT SAID.

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.435
THAT THE SAY OKAY WELL THE

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.969
PARENTS AREN'T COOPERATING WITH

MY CHILD'S RECORDS SO NOW THE

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.016
THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS TO GO TO

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.684
COURT AND BASICALLY THEN

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:15.186
SUBPOENA NOT.

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:16.487
INDIVIDUAL RECORDS BUT SAVINGS

THROUGH IN FINE WHICH PATIENTS

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.529
THEY GRANTED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:30.501
TO ASSUMING THEY KEPT ACTIVE

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:31.769

ARE PHILOSOPHICALLY DISINCLINED

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.243
TOWARD VACCINATION ARE

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:13.744
CONTAMINATING.

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.813
THE LARGER A STUDENT BODY AND

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.248
EXPOSING THEM.

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:03.987
IN WHERE I BROUGHT THIS.

00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:04.888
TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION SO THE

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:09.393
IRONY -- THAT WE USE THAT SIGN

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.395
AND I LEARNED IT -- WORKING WITH

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:14.364
STUDENTS SOME OF WHOM WHO HAD

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:15.966
LOST THEIR HEARING.

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:17.668
AS A RESULT OF A HIGH

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:18.769
TEMPERATURE.

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:21.672
RESULTING FROM THE MEASLES --

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:24.141
AND SO I WILL NOT FORGET.

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:26.443
MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:30.547
WHO FOR COMMENT. TO A DISEASE.

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.649
THAT WENT AWAY.

00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:33.951
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.385
SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME FOR MANY

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:38.288
YEARS.

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:40.224
I BALANCE THAT WITH THE NOTION

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:40.824
THAT.

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:43.660
TEAM IS THE HARDEST JOB ON THE

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:44.928
PLANET [inaudible]

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:57.874
THE HARDEST.

00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:00.110
OTHER THAN OUR GRAMMY NIGHT IN

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:01.778
THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:03.447
AND WE HAVE TO RELY.

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:05.015
ON OUR BEST JUDGMENT WHAT WE

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:07.751
BELIEVE IS BEST FOR OUR CHILD

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.853
AND CONSOLE.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.222
WITH THOSE WE TRUST.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:16.760
AND SO WHAT'S DISTURBING ABOUT.

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.195
IN MY NOW SECOND EXPERIENCE WITH

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:19.630
THIS ISSUE AS A LEGISLATOR

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:22.599
HAVING SAT THROUGH.

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.568
HOURS OF HEARINGS.

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.436
HOURS OF MEETINGS WITH

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:27.337
CONSTITUENTS AND NON

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:29.773
CONSTITUENTS.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.775
READING REPORTS LOOKING AT

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:35.078
VIDEOS THAT WERE SENT MY WAY.

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:37.247
IS HOW DO WE VALIDATE THE

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:38.882
INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE IN

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:41.084
THE UNIVERSE.

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.252
HOW DO WE VALIDATED HOW THE WE

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:45.355
KNOW THAT IT'S SCIENCE BASED?

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:49.359
AN OBJECTIVE AND FAIR.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.827
AND SOUL I HAVE A QUESTION OF

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:53.196
THE AUTHOR.

TO YOU IN HEALTH COMMITTEE --

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.438
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.407
THAT WE ARE DEBATING THE ACTUAL

00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:05.309
MERITS OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE B.

00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:07.411
L. RIGHT AND THAT WE ARE NOT

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:10.781
DEBATING BASED ON FEAR.

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.482
AND MISS REPRESENTATION.

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:14.284
AND SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER FOR

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:15.352
ME.

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:18.689
IF THE BILL ALLOWS. FOR MEDICAL

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:21.625
EXEMPTIONS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:24.094
UNDER WHICH THOSE EXEMPTIONS

00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:25.262
WOULD BE AFFORDED YES.

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:27.197
THIS BILL CERTAINLY ALLOWS

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:28.498
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AFFECT WE

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:30.067
WANT TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:32.035
THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION SYSTEM SO.

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.970
THE PURPOSES BILLS ACTUALLY TO

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.505
PROTECT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:37.240
AND WHEN A CHILD RECEIVES A

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:38.675
MEDICAL EXEMPTION DAY NEED THE

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:40.444
PROTECTION OF THE OTHER CHILDREN

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.645
IN THEIR SCHOOLS SO THAT THEY

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:44.715
DON'T GET INFECTED WITH MEASLES

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:44.981
DEVELOP.

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:45.816
HEARING LOSS OR OTHER THE

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:47.818
QUALITY FROM MEASLES -- EVEN

00:49:47.884 --> 00:49:49.286
THAT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN INCLUDES

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:51.555
OTENTIALLY DEATH -- FOR ONE IN

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:53.523
A THOUSAND AND THE STANDARDS BY

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:57.294
WHICH THE EXEMPTION REVIEWED IS

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.062
USING AND IF THEY SAID THE

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:00.163
STANDARD OF CARE EVIDENCE BASED --

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.265
CDC GUIDELINES -- WE ARE ALSO

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.300
LOOKING AT THE AMERICAN QUE

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:04.501
PEDIATRIC GUIDELINES INCLUDING

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.503
THOSE AS WELL -- NOW SOME PEOPLE

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.604
POINT OUT THE FAIRLY SIMILAR

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:08.605
THAT'S BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:10.107
SPACES PRETTY WELL RESEARCH THAT

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.541
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF

00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:12.976
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DECADES.

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:15.379
OF USING THESE VACCINATIONS SO

00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:17.180
WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE SURE

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.916
THAT CHILDREN WHO NEED MEDICAL

00:50:19.983 --> 00:50:21.351
EXEMPTIONS WILL GET.

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:21.952
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT

00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:23.553
CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY NEED

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.088
MEDICAL EXPENSES WILL GET THEM

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.523
AND THEN WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.190
THEY WILL BE SAFE.

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:29.092
AT SCHOOL AND THAT'S WHAT THE

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:33.597
PURPOSES OF THIS BILL.

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:36.299
THANK YOU.

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.267

ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE

00:50:38.068 --> 00:50:39.035
ON THE ISSUE [inaudible]

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.871
SENATOR WIENER.

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:43.006
I THANK YOU -- I RISE IN SUPPORT

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.207
OF THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.942
CENTER FROM SACRAMENTO FOR HIS

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:47.377
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE FOR

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:48.678
YEARS I KNOW.

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:50.547
IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY -- BUT

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.416
SOMETIMES LEADERSHIP -- MEANS

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:53.517
THAT IT TAKES A PERSONAL TOLL

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:55.318
AND I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:57.120
THE CENTER FROM SACRAMENTO.

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:59.256
WE'RE NOT JUST DOING -- ONE STOP

00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:01.391
AT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT FOR

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:02.893
STICKING WITH THAT BECAUSE THIS

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.528
IS SO CRITICAL FOR THE PUBLIC

00:51:04.594 --> 00:51:05.195
HEALTH.

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.897
OF OUR STATE AND I THINK IT IS

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.532
SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:09.132
UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU -- IF

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.701
THERE IS AN ACTUAL MEDICAL

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:12.569
REASON.

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:15.672
WHY YOUR CHILD CAN BE VACCINATED

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.441
YOU CAN STILL GET AN EXEMPTION

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:18.842
THIS TEST AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.477
REVIEW TO DEAL WITH THESE

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:22.479
UNSCRUPULOUS UNSCRUPULOUS

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:23.747
POSITIONS?

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:25.615
I ALSO THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:26.983
TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS NOT

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.685
AN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT -- PARENTAL

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.321
RIGHTS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:34.491
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:35.725
VACCINATE THEIR KIDS.

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:36.960
THIS IS ABOUT PARENTS WHO ARE

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:37.694
TERRIFIED THAT THEIR OWN

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:38.595
CHILDREN WHO CANNOT BE

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:39.296
VACCINATED.

00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:41.064
ARE GOING TO BE EXPOSED -- LAST

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:43.200
YEAR I MET -- A CONSTITUENT OF

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:45.702
MINE -- FATHER WHO HAS A CHILD

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:48.138
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND HAS A

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.640
BABY AND HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:52.576
THE FAMILY WAS TO DROP.

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:53.743
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.278
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILD OFF AT

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:57.481
SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND HE HAD THE

00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:59.382
BABY WITH THEM BECAUSE ENOUGH

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.017
CHILDCARE.

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:02.352
AND HE WAS IN A CONUNDRUM

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.753
BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO BRING

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.456
HIS BABY INTO THE SCHOOL KNOWING

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.124
THAT THERE WERE UNVACCINATED

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.159
CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL BECAUSE

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.194
THAT BABYWAS TOO YOUNG. TO BE

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:13.763
VACCINATED SO THIS IS WE HAVE TO

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.732
LOOK AT THE AND NEEDS OF THE

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.234
ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.702
CHILDREN WHO FOR WHOM THERE IS A

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.604
MEDICAL ISSUE WILL NOT NEED TO

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:21.638
BE VACCINATED THEY CAN GET AN

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:25.509
EXEMPTION BUT WE MUST PROTECT.

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:28.411
THE BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:30.480
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:30.780
[inaudible]

00:52:30.847 --> 00:52:34.684
SENATOR ALLEN -- MEMBERS A K. A.

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:37.354
ALSO WANT -- TO FIRST SAY THAT

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.055
I'M.

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:41.491
HAS THE JOINT AUTHORS ON SB TWO

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:42.626
SEVEN SEVEN WITH THE CENTER FROM

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.994
SACRAMENTO.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.963
I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT LAW.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.031
I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO BOOST

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:49.599
VACCINATION RATES SIGNIFICANTLY

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:51.101
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:52.769
WAY THAT -- THAT REALLY HAS

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.004
HELPED.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:54.604
IF YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:55.739
OUTBREAKS THAT WE SEE IN OTHER

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:56.940
STATES.

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:59.609
WE HAVE NOT HAD THE OUTBREAKS

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:01.011
THAT THAT EVICT THAT HAVE TAKEN

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:02.779
PLACE IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:03.880
OREGON.

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.348
AT THE SAME LEVEL HERE I THINK

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.850
IT'S LARGELY HAVING TO DO WITH

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:10.587
SB -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN IN IN FACT

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.155
THEY'RE SIMILAR LAWS PROPOSED IN

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:14.090
OREGON WASHINGTON THAT WERE

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:18.194
ROLLED BACK BECAUSE OF OF OF THE

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:20.397
OF THE OBJECTIONS OF FOLKS --

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:21.698
AND AND IT ALSO THE INTENSITY

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.300
AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT I WANT

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:25.068
TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE --

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.736
INTO THE SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.138
HASBEEN SUBJECT TO

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:29.873
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.708
VICIOUS.

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:34.411
VILIFICATION AN ATTACK -- I'VE

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:36.012
GOT A CHANCE TO TAKE EXTRA TO

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:39.115
LIMIT MYSELF BUT BUT I REALLY I

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:39.983
REALLY IT IT.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.051
YOU KNOW I THINK THE VAST

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:43.620
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:44.487
OPPOSED TO WHERE.

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:45.455
HE HAS SOUGHT TO DO YOU HAVE

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:47.524
BEEN VERY RESPECTFUL AND ENGAGED

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:49.759
IN AND BUT THERE ARE A GROUP OF

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.227
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENGAGE IN

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:53.396
BEHAVIOR THAT IS IS SO BEYOND

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:54.230
THE PALE.

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:55.699
AND IT'S REALLY DESPICABLE TO ME

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:58.101
AND I THINK THAT THE SENATOR --

AND DONE.

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:22.292
MY PERSONAL CHALLENGE WITH THIS

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.093
BILL IS THAT AYE.

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:25.462
AYE SO MANY TIMES DURING THE

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:30.100
COURSE OF THE DEBATE OVER SB --

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:31.334
TWO SEVEN SEVEN MADE COMMITMENTS

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:33.370
RELATING TO THE GRANTING OF THE

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.705
MEDICAL EXAMS AND THE THE

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.641
DISCRETION OF THE DOCTOR

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:38.208
ASSOCIATED WITH THE GRANTING

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:39.175
MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:42.545
I'M ON CNN NBC.

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:45.782
AND I FACT THOSE MIGHT WOMEN

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:47.083
VERY FIRST BILLS I THOUGHT THAT

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.518
WAS WHAT LIFE IS GOING TO BE

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:49.152
LIKE AND I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:50.220
ANY THOSE.

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.489
CHANNELS EVER SENSE BUT BUT THAT

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:53.490
WAS WHAT IT WAS LIKE RIGHT

00:54:53.556 --> 00:54:54.090
COMING ROUTE THE GATES WITHOUT

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.191
CREEK THAT WILD EXPERIENCE THAT

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:57.494
WE LIVE THROUGH.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.028
THAT MANY OF US HERE LIVE

00:54:58.094 --> 00:54:59.763
THROUGH -- BUT I AM ON THE

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.731
RECORD SO MANY TIMES TALKING

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:03.099
ABOUT THAT AS A CRITICAL PART OF

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.367
SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN THAT I JUST

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.568
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:07.037
WITH THIS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:09.272
PART OF OF SB TWO SEVEN SIX I DO

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:09.806
THINK THE DATA COLLECTION

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:10.640
ASPECTS ARE.

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:11.841
REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I WOULD

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.443
PERSONALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:14.778
FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO DO WHAT

00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:15.945
CENTER PAN IS TRYING TO DO

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:17.681
THROUGH THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT I

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:19.382
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:19.949
AND I'VE I'VE SPOKEN AT THE

00:55:20.016 --> 00:55:21.418
CENTER PAN ABOUT THIS AND HE

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:22.352
REALLY DOES BELIEVE IN I THINK

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.053
HE'S A STRONG CASE AS TO WHY

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:23.920
THAT.

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:26.122
THE WAY HE'S PROPOSE IT IS A IS

00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:28.625
A CLEANER MCHANISM -- BUT IT

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:29.592
EIGHT A BUT IT DOES PUT ME

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:31.094
PERSONALLY IN A VERY DIFFICULT

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:33.263
SPOT BECAUSE OF THE COMMITMENTS

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.864
THAT I MADE -- THROUGH THE

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:38.668
PROCESS OF THE PASSAGE OF SB.

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:39.569
TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND SO THAT'S

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:42.172
WHY I'M I'M LAYING OFF ON THIS --

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:43.073
BECAUSE OF THOSE COMMITMENTS I

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:44.040
MADE.

00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:45.542
AND WANTING TO TO STAND TRUE TO

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:49.879
MY WORD -- I I I I DO SHARE THE

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:51.848
CORE CONCERNS ABOUT UNSCRUPULOUS

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:52.615
DOCTORS.

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:54.217
BOB I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:55.885
IMPORTANT TO PROTECT DISCRETION

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:57.220
FOR DOCTORS AND I THINK THAT'S

00:55:57.287 --> 00:56:00.390
AT THE HEART OF WHAT MAKES THIS

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:03.226
BILL CHALLENGING AND DONE -- SO

00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:04.694

NOT SUCCEED TODAY COULD THE BILL

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.247
STILL BE RECONSIDERED AND

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:28.618
AMENDED.

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:30.286
COULD BE AMENDED ON THE FLOOR

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:35.458
AFTER A VOTE HAS BEEN.

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:36.793
THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.094

ON THIS BILL -- IS AGAIN THIS IS

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.964
ABOUT KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.566
WE RIGHT NOW HAVE AN ACTIVE

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.802
MEASLES OUTBREAK GOING ON LEASES

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.136
HAPPENS WAS CONTAGIOUS DISEASE.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.137
THAT'S THE ONE WE HEAR ABOUT

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.672
FIRST THAT WOULD POINT OUT THAT

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.307
IN TWENTY TEN TO GET A PROTEST

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:51.908
THIS OUTBREAK THAT KILLED TEN

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.709
INSTANCE AND OTHER VACCINE

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:54.777
PREVENTABLE DISEASE.

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.546
WE HAVE OTHER DISEASES AS WELL

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.181
THAT THAT'S A THAT'S THE REASON

01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.016
WHY THIS LEGISLATURE THE ONLY

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:01.684
PASSED SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN BUT

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.619
ALSO PASS REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:04.954
IMMUNIZATIONS FOR SCHOOL ENTRY

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:07.957
IT'S THIS LEGISLATURE DETECTED

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:08.591
THAT.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:09.992
SO IT WAS MADE REFERENCE TO BY

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.761
SEVERAL PEOPLE ABOUT TWO SEVEN

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:13.696
SEVEN I FEEL LIKE I HAVE.

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.264
TO CORRECT THE RECORD REGARDING.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.599
WHAT HAPPENED TO SEVEN SEVEN SO

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.201
IN SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN ACTUALLY

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:19.502
THE BILL DID NOT ACTUALLY

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:20.970
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS?

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.572
ACCEPTED AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.307
TAKEN -- AND ASSEMBLY HEALTH OF

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:26.209
MY AMENDMENT -- THE MEDICAL

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.143
EXEMPTION ITSELF.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.880
IN FACT THE HOPE WAS IS THAT.

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.348
BASICALLY THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:33.983
PRIOR TO SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WAS

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:35.284
AT THE DISCRETION OF THE

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.752
POSITION THAT WAS NOT A NEW

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:39.322
INNOVATION AND SB -- TWO SEVEN

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:40.423
SEVEN WE WERE HAPPY TO LEAVE IT

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.958
THERE BECAUSE WE FIGURED THAT

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:44.927
THE CHILD'S PHYSICIAN WOULD TALK.

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:47.029
TO THE FAMILY AND THEY WOULDN'T

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.231
DO AND WOULD PROVIDE.

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.832
ACCURATE AND APPROPRIATE

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.334
GUIDANCE.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.236
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER SB TWO SEVEN

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:55.304
SEVEN IS NOT?

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:56.672
FAMILIES GOING TO THEIR OWN

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:58.374
CHILD POSITION FACT WE SEEN AND

01:02:58.441 --> 01:02:59.675
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHERE PEOPLE

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:01.944
HAVE POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA MY

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:03.012
DOCTOR WILL GIVE MY CHILD

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.680
MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO I WENT AND

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.048
BOUGHT.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:08.117
ONE THIS IS NOT WHAT WE INTENDED

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:10.019
WITH SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND THE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:11.287
EXISTING MEDICAL EXEMPTION THAT

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.289
IS NOT THE PROMISE THAT WE MADE

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:15.591
THAT WE WOULD SAY IT'S OKAY FOR

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:16.893
PHYSICIANS TO PROFIT FROM

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.094
SELLING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.328
PATIENTS THAT THEY DON'T

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:20.796
REGULARLY CARE.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.465
FOR THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:23.699
THE PROBLEM IS IT'S THE S IS

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:24.834
POINTED OUT IT DOESN'T JUST

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.335
AFFECT THE CHILD WHO GOT THE

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:27.703
EXEMPTION DO NOW ISN'T

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:28.704
VACCINATED.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.139
IT AFFECTS THE OTHER CHILDREN IN

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.240
THE SCHOOL AND THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.643
WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY THIS

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.545
IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE ABOUT WELL

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:36.913
A FAMILY MADE DECISION FOR HER

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:37.713
OWN CHILD.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.082
IN FACT EVEN UNDER THREE TWO

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:40.950
SEVEN SEVEN THEY HAVE THE CHOICE

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:41.918
WHETHER TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILD

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.019
OR NOT IF THEY DON'T GIVE

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.587
INFORMED CONSENT THEIR CHILD

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.955
DOESN'T GET VACCINATED.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.490
BUT THERE IS A CONSEQUENCE OF

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:48.658
THAT AND THAT CONSEQUENCES IT

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.293
RELATE TO THEIR CHILD REALLY TO

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:51.594
THE OTHER CHILDREN AND WE NEED

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.262
TO PROTECT THEM.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:54.764
SO I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN I WOULD

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.566
MAKE NOTE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:03:56.632 --> 01:04:00.670
OF CALIFORNIA -- BASICALLY --

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.205
ONE NEEDS INFORMATION THAT THEY

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.506
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IN ORDER TO

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:04.607
DO ENFORCEMENT BUT MORE

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:05.975
IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO BE SURE

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:07.009
OUR SCHOOLS ARE SAFE.

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.578
SO CERTAINLY YES WE NEED TO GO

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:09.645
AFTER THE BAD DOCTORS BUT WE

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:10.913
NEED TO BE SURE THE SCHOOLS ARE

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.215
SAFE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:14.650
AND I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT --

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:17.253
IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF THE

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.455
EXEMPTIONS AND WHAT EXETER.

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.823
YEAH WE HAVE A WE HAVE

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.358
INCORPORATED TO BUILD THE CDC

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.626
GUIDELINES WERE LOOKING AT ALSO

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.461
INCLUDING SAID REFERRING TO THE

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.596
EIGHTY GUIDELINES.

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:27.897
IF THERE ARE OTHER EVIDENCE

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:29.632
BASED GUIDELINES EVIDENCE BASED

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.033
GUIDELINES OF PEOPLE WISH TO

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.902
SHARE WERE CERTAINLY ALWAYS OPEN

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.670
TO LOOKING AT THIS -- I WOULD

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.138
ALSO MAKE NOTE IN TERMS OF

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.040
PRIVACY -- SO WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:39.875
DATA BASE FOR THE PART OF PUBLIC

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:41.077
HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF THE HEALTH

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.345
ACTUALLY MAINTAINS A VARIETY OF

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.113
DIFFERENT DATABASES CURRENTLY WE

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.581
HAVE A CANCER DATABASE THEY

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:46.482
AFFECT.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.684
STD DATABASE SO AND THEY ARE

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.720
BOUND BY THE SAME PRIVACY LAWS

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:51.354
AND SEEM AS A MEDICAL BOARD OF

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.289
CALIFORNIA I WOULD ALSO MAKE

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:54.857
NOTE THAT ACTUALLY.

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.592
AGAIN THIS IS IT THAT THE VOTE

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.560
THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.995
WOULD GET AS THEY WOULD ACTUALLY

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.896
GET INFORMATION ON A FORM THAT

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:01.664
THEY WOULD DESIGNATE THE

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:02.898
PHYSICIAN WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:03.966
THE SENATE FOR THE MEDICAL

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:04.934
ENGINE IT'S NOT THAT.

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:06.836
BASICALLY THAT THE THE PART OF

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.237
THE HEALTH WITH ACTUALLY ASK FOR

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.505
THE ENTIRE MEDICAL RECORD OF THE

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:10.473
CHILD.

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:11.741
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:14.977
CALIFORNIA FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.178
ACTUALLY.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.213
GRABBING THE ENTIRE MEDICAL

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:17.947
RECORD FOR A CHILD THE PHYSICIAN

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:18.848
WAS CERTIFIED THEY EXAMINE THE

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:20.516
CHILD IT WAS CERTIFIED AT THIS

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.651
IS THE CONDITIONS BY WHICH WE

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.019
ARE SEEKING MEDICAL EXEMPTION OF

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.553
THOSE ARE VALID REASONS THAT ARE

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.755
BOTH OF THE GRANT.

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:28.090
EFFECT WE EXPECT THAT PHYSICIANS

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:29.659
WOULD BE HONEST IN WHAT THEY A

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:31.527
TEST TO SEE IF THEY AREN'T.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:32.128
WELL I GUESS THAT'S WHEN THE

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:33.529
MEDICAL BOARD WOULD GET INVOLVED

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:34.430
IN OF COURSE SINCE THE

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:35.298
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AS IS

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.732
INFORMATION SO WITH THE MEDICAL

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:37.566
BOARD.

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.368
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WITH IN

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:40.603
TERMS OF THE ISSUES RAISED ABOUT

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:44.173
PRIVACY THE ISSUES RAISED ABOUT --

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.143
THE OUT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:48.044
HOW THEM THE TOP PART OF THE CAL

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.245
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS INFORMATION

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:50.613
IS SOMETHING THAT.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.647
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE CAN

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.616
ALL TAKE COMFORT IN I ALSO JUST

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:54.884
HAVE TO BRIEFLY MENTION THAT

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.385
THAT THERE ARE SOME IF THIS

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.387
INFORMATION -- SHARED --

01:05:58.454 --> 01:05:59.822
REGARDING FIRST OF ALL VACCINES

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.691
ARE TO THE THOROUGHLY TESTED OF

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:04.660
ALL -- MATT PHARMACEUTICALS THAT --

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:06.395
MEDICATIONS -- THAT THERE'S ANY

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.097
SENSE OF THE INSTITUTE MEDICINE

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:11.801
DID NUMEROUS REPORTS THAT THE

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:12.835
CLAIM THAT THERE'S NO SAFETY.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.337
TESTING OF A FAX SCENES IS IS

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.971
AND CERTAINLY A COMPLETE.

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.907
IT IS CERTAINLY -- MISINFORMED --

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:59.748
BUT I WOULD LOOK FORWARD.

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:03.518
SOME OF THAT NEEDS TO BE UNWOUND.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.920
AND WE CANNOT KEEP PASSING BONDS

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:08.089

SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE VERY

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.876
SPECIAL.

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.611
IN THAT THEY HAVE RETAINED

01:22:29.678 --> 01:22:32.280

THEY ARE STILL FUNCTIONAL

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.528
BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAINTAIN THEM

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.496

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:51.833
THEM WORSE QUAKE SAFE.

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.201

WILLING TO MAKE IT PAY OFF.

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.069
OVER MANY MANY DECADES.

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:41.903
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.505
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BUT THEY

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:45.006
DIDN'T JUST HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.708
MANY OF THEM BEGAN IN THE

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:47.642
EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS.

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:49.010
MANY OF THEM WERE ESTABLISHED IN

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:50.245
THE NINETEEN EARLY NINETEEN

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.514
HUNDREDS WE CELEBRATE THAT BUT

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.482
IS THE SENATOR FROM TO HIM THAT.

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.351
MADE QUITE CLEAR.

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.352
SOME OF THEM ARE ALMOST IN

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.254
ORIGINAL FORM FROM WHICH THEY

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.388
WERE BUILT THAT BACK IN THOSE

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:01.789
TIMES.

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.658
SO WE BENEFITTED BECAUSE OUR

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.326
PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:06.961
INVESTED IN THOSE FACILITIES AND

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.596
THEY WERE THERE FOR US.

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:09.731
AND THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT'S

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:11.733
BEING ASKED OF US TODAY IF WE DO

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:12.700
NOT INVEST.

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.369
IN THOSE FACILITIES FOR OUR

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:15.370
STUDENTS.

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:17.305
TODAY TOMORROW AND INTO THE

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:18.907
FUTURE WHAT WHAT'S LEFT FOR THEM.

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:20.942
WHAT'S LEFT FOR THEM.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:23.278
AND I KNOW PART OF THAT ANSWER.

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.646
AND THAT'S IT THAT TUITION IS

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.214
GOING TO GO UP FEES ARE GOING TO

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:27.749
GO UP AND THE BIRDS THAT USED TO

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:30.151
BE BORNE BY ALL OF US AS A STATE.

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:31.920
BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THAT ARE

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.688
UNIVERSITIES BRING TO THE STATE

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:35.156
ARE NOW GOING TO BE BORNE BY OUR

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.025
OUR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES OR

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.326
NOT AT ALL.

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:40.361
AND WE KNOW THE DETERIORATION

01:26:40.428 --> 01:26:42.230
THAT WILL LEAD.

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.565
TO SO WHEN THE QUESTION COMES UP

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:45.700
WHAT WILL THIS COST AND WHAT

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:48.236
WILL BE NEED TO BE CUT -- I

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:50.705
THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS IT'S

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:51.973
ALL ABOUT CHOICES THAT WE MAKE.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.108
AS A LEGISLATURE.

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.543
IT'S ABOUT THE VALUES AND HOW WE

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.011
PLACE THEM WITHIN OUR FUNDING

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.313
SYSTEMS.

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.081
AND I KNOW FOR ME AND FOR MANY

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:00.949
THE INVESTMENT IN OUR HIGHER

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.917
EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR THE

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.586
STUDENTS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW --

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.621
IS A HECK OF A GOOD INVESTMENT

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:08.056
AND AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:10.124
HOW WE GO FORWARD INVESTING THE

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.193
PRECIOUS TAXPAYERS MONEY THAT WE

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.762
ARE IN POWER TO OVERSEE.

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:15.830
THERE ARE THIRTY THREE

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.432
UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT

LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST SEES MORE

SB ONE TWENTY WOULD ALLOW THE

02:02:11.023 --> 02:02:13.693
A GUN SAFETY WITHOUT CREATING A

02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:14.927
NEW CLASS OF FELONIES.

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:17.530
OR INFRINGING ON THE RIGHTS YES

02:02:17.596 --> 02:02:19.799
THE RIGHTS OF THOROUGHLY

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:22.001
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.

02:02:22.068 --> 02:02:23.102
THIS IS NOT A BLIND ATTEMPT TO

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:24.637
TAKE AWAY GUNS FROM RESPONSIBLE

02:02:24.704 --> 02:02:26.906

BUT FOR LAWFUL PURPOSES AND

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:36.348
THOSE WHO DO NOT FIND A WAY.

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:38.150

THOSE RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE.

02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:45.491
SO THIS WOULD KEEP GUNS OUT OF

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.093
THE WRONG HANDS.

02:02:47.159 --> 02:02:48.394

THE IRONY.

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.783

02:03:57.663 --> 02:04:00.833
FOR USING A FIRE ARM.

02:35:06.163 --> 02:35:08.966

03:04:47.109 --> 03:04:48.143

03:04:59.087 --> 03:05:00.522

03:05:19.174 --> 03:05:20.409

03:20:52.407 --> 03:20:54.142
VIOLENCE IS REAL.

03:20:54.208 --> 03:20:55.943

INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER THE REAL

03:21:03.084 --> 03:21:03.918

THE REAL PROBLEM TODAY'S WORLD

03:21:14.195 --> 03:21:16.697
IS THAT TOO MANY CRIMINALS HAVE

03:21:16.764 --> 03:21:18.800

03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:34.482
BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN

03:21:34.549 --> 03:21:36.551
LESS THAN STELLAR IN FACT I

03:21:36.951 --> 03:21:39.353
A FILLING.

03:21:39.420 --> 03:21:40.788
LET'S CONSIDER WHAT IT MEANS

03:21:40.855 --> 03:21:43.090

IT IS ENCOMPASSED A VERY

03:28:41.442 --> 03:28:42.776
IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE BUT IT TOOK

03:28:42.843 --> 03:28:44.678
MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF DOZENS

03:28:44.745 --> 03:28:46.080
OF CASES.

03:28:46.146 --> 03:28:48.883
AROUND THE COUNTRY TO DEAL WITH

03:28:48.949 --> 03:28:50.885
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST IN ALL

03:28:50.951 --> 03:28:52.887
THE VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS TO

03:28:52.953 --> 03:28:55.055
UNDERSTAND ARMED HOW THIS

03:28:55.122 --> 03:28:56.290
PROCESS OF VOTING AND

03:28:56.357 --> 03:28:58.325
REDISTRICTING WORKS WE SEEN THE

03:28:58.392 --> 03:28:59.760
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

03:28:59.827 --> 03:29:02.563
DESIGNATE CERTAIN COUNTIES

03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:03.163
BECAUSE THEY HAD CHALLENGES IN

03:29:03.230 --> 03:29:03.764
THE LIKE.

03:29:03.831 --> 03:29:05.566
WE HAVE FIVE TIMES IT TOOK IN

03:29:05.633 --> 03:29:07.935
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT

03:29:08.002 --> 03:29:08.969
REDISTRICTING.

03:29:09.036 --> 03:29:11.405
AND I SUPPORTED THAT BECAUSE I

03:29:11.472 --> 03:29:12.873
BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A DAY

03:29:12.940 --> 03:29:14.541
APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

03:29:14.608 --> 03:29:15.743
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OF

03:29:15.809 --> 03:29:17.211
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AND THE

03:29:17.278 --> 03:29:18.846
LIKE TO AVOID A LOT OF THE

03:29:18.913 --> 03:29:20.247
SHENANIGANS THAT OCCURRED.

03:29:20.314 --> 03:29:22.516
YEAH A BEFORE AND STILL IS

03:29:22.583 --> 03:29:23.717
OCCURRING IN OTHER STATES.

03:29:23.784 --> 03:29:26.053
ARMED AND AT THE CORE OF IT IS.

03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:27.855
CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT.

03:29:27.922 --> 03:29:30.224
WHEN WE HEAR AMONG THOSE WHO WE

03:29:30.291 --> 03:29:31.959
REPRESENT OVER AND OVER AGAIN

03:29:32.026 --> 03:29:33.160
THAT WE'RE ENGAGED IN

03:29:33.227 --> 03:29:35.462
GERRYMANDERING SELFDEALING?

03:29:35.529 --> 03:29:37.698
AS POLITICIANS WHICH THEN CREATE

03:29:37.765 --> 03:29:39.266
OUTCOMES THE DON'T REFLECT

03:29:39.333 --> 03:29:41.735
REPRESENTATION OF THE VOTERS.

03:29:41.802 --> 03:29:42.803
AND WHAT THE WHAT THIS

03:29:42.870 --> 03:29:44.305
COMMISSION IS DONE AT THE STATE

03:29:44.371 --> 03:29:45.873
HAS AND MY JUDGMENT CREATED A

03:29:45.940 --> 03:29:47.274
GREAT BODY BECAUSE ALL OF US

03:29:47.341 --> 03:29:48.642
HERE TODAY OR AS A RESULT OF

03:29:48.709 --> 03:29:49.843
THAT REDISTRICTING.

03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:51.412
AND I THINK YOU KNOW YOU HEARD

03:29:51.478 --> 03:29:53.180
ALL THE TIME BEFORE THIS ISSUE

03:29:53.247 --> 03:29:54.515
OF REGISTRY OF GERRYMANDERING

03:29:54.581 --> 03:29:56.216
AND IT'S GONE.

03:29:56.283 --> 03:29:57.551
AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE OF

03:29:57.618 --> 03:29:59.386
THE REASONS WHY WE ENJOY A

03:29:59.453 --> 03:30:01.088
GREATER LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IS A

03:30:01.155 --> 03:30:02.589
LEGISLATIVE BODY IS BECAUSE

03:30:02.656 --> 03:30:03.724
THOSE KINDS OF ARGUMENTS HAVE

03:30:03.791 --> 03:30:04.992
BEEN ELIMINATED.

03:30:05.059 --> 03:30:06.593
SO IF YOU BALANCE ON THE ONE

03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:07.928
HAND THE CONFIDENCE IN

03:30:07.995 --> 03:30:10.064
GOVERNMENT A BALANCE ON ON ON

03:30:10.130 --> 03:30:12.132
WHICH IS SO ESSENTIAL FOR ALL OF

03:30:12.199 --> 03:30:14.268
US TO DO OUR WORK AND TO THE

03:30:14.335 --> 03:30:15.769
APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THAT

03:30:15.836 --> 03:30:16.236
HAVE.

03:30:16.303 --> 03:30:17.871
DEVELOPED IN THE COURTS OF THE

03:30:17.938 --> 03:30:20.908
LAST FIFTY YEARS I I THINK THAT

03:30:20.975 --> 03:30:22.009
THIS SYSTEM WORKS WELL.

03:30:22.076 --> 03:30:22.843
IT IS IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A

03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:24.445
CHALLENGE AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:30:24.511 --> 03:30:25.446
THE COUNTY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

03:30:25.512 --> 03:30:26.814
PARTISAN LIKE WE ARE HERE

03:30:26.880 --> 03:30:28.382
THEY'RE ALL WE ARE PART OF A

03:30:28.449 --> 03:30:30.351
REFORM MOVEMENT TO HIRAM JOHNSON

03:30:30.417 --> 03:30:32.619
WAS TO ELIMINATE -- PARTISANSHIP

03:30:32.686 --> 03:30:34.154
OF THE COUNTIES BUT I THINK

03:30:34.221 --> 03:30:35.122
THEY'RE SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF

03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:36.256
PROTECTIONS.

03:30:36.323 --> 03:30:38.092
TIME IS NOW AND I THINK IS AN

03:30:38.158 --> 03:30:41.161
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD HI -- JOY

03:30:41.228 --> 03:30:42.196

TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED WITH

03:30:53.140 --> 03:30:54.141
COLLEAGUES.

03:30:54.208 --> 03:30:57.111
THE AUTHOR OF SB ONE THIRTY NINE

03:30:57.177 --> 03:30:58.679
HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.

03:30:58.746 --> 03:31:00.147
IN GETTING TO BILLS APPROVED

03:31:14.128 --> 03:31:16.063
BILLS.

03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:19.166
BUT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM.

03:31:19.233 --> 03:31:21.235
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CENSUS.

03:31:21.301 --> 03:31:22.503
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO

03:31:22.569 --> 03:31:25.606
SEE IF THOSE TWO BILLS.

03:31:25.672 --> 03:31:26.673
WHERE APPROPRIATE HELPFUL?

NINE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO JYJ

03:31:37.084 --> 03:31:39.053
PROBLEMS.

03:31:39.119 --> 03:31:40.854
THE FIRST IS THAT SINCE THE

03:31:40.921 --> 03:31:42.890
PASSAGE OF SB ELEVEN OH EIGHT IN

A CENSUS.

03:31:46.160 --> 03:31:47.961
SO WE WE NEED TO SEE IF THAT

03:31:48.028 --> 03:31:50.264
WORKS FIRST AND IF IT DOESN'T

03:31:50.330 --> 03:31:51.765
THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE

03:31:51.832 --> 03:31:53.300

03:32:05.312 --> 03:32:06.280
APPROACH BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE IN

SACRAMENTO WERE SO MUCH SMARTER

03:32:07.748 --> 03:32:10.317
THAN THOSE THAT LIVE IN COUNTIES

03:32:10.384 --> 03:32:12.786
OF SAY TEN MILLION PLUS

ALL THAT WE DO.

03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:58.098
I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE

03:32:58.165 --> 03:32:59.766
AUTHOR FIVE IF I MAY.

03:32:59.833 --> 03:33:01.869
SENATOR ALLEN.

03:33:01.935 --> 03:33:03.570
YOU MAY PROCEED SO THE THE

03:33:03.637 --> 03:33:06.106
EAGLES ARE ADMIRABLE -- AND

03:33:06.173 --> 03:33:08.008
THAT'S TO CREATE THIS FAIRNESS

03:33:08.075 --> 03:33:09.977
STANDARD CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY

03:33:10.043 --> 03:33:11.378
YOU FOR YOUR LIMóN IT -- TO

03:33:11.445 --> 03:33:14.014
COUNTIES THAT ARE OVER -- TWO

03:33:14.081 --> 03:33:14.615
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND RATHER

03:33:14.681 --> 03:33:16.984
THAN HAVING APPLIED TO EVERYONE

03:33:17.050 --> 03:33:17.985
EQUALLY.

03:33:18.051 --> 03:33:19.953
YEAH SO THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT WAS

03:33:20.020 --> 03:33:21.555
IT HAD EVERYTHING TO HAVE COST

03:33:21.622 --> 03:33:24.091
WHEN THE BILL FIRST -- CAME

03:33:24.158 --> 03:33:25.659
FORWARD WE DID NOT HAVE THIS

03:33:25.726 --> 03:33:27.327
PROVISION THAT WAS PUSHED INTO

03:33:27.394 --> 03:33:28.695
THE BILL BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF

03:33:28.762 --> 03:33:31.098
FINANCE COMMITTEE -- THAT MADE

03:33:31.165 --> 03:33:34.401
THE COUNTY BETWEEN TEN FIFTY

03:33:34.468 --> 03:33:34.935
THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAND

03:33:35.002 --> 03:33:36.870
SUBJECT TO CORPORATION -- YOU

03:33:36.937 --> 03:33:38.205
KNOW I SO IT'S A THE INITIAL

03:33:38.272 --> 03:33:40.207
IDEA WAS THAT FOUR SMALL

03:33:40.274 --> 03:33:43.110
COUNTIES -- IT WOULD BE A

03:33:43.177 --> 03:33:45.112
SIGNIFICANT HIT TO THEIR BUDGET --

03:33:45.179 --> 03:33:45.846
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SMALLER

03:33:45.913 --> 03:33:47.281
BUDGETS TO GO THROUGH THE

03:33:47.347 --> 03:33:49.216
PROCESS OF OF HAVING AN

03:33:49.283 --> 03:33:50.517
INDEPENDENT DISTRICT COMMISSION

03:33:50.584 --> 03:33:52.586
THAT WAS SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER

03:33:52.653 --> 03:33:53.187
PROCESSES.

03:33:53.253 --> 03:33:54.454
SO THAT WAS YOU THAT WAS THE

03:33:54.521 --> 03:33:58.959
THAT WAS THE THOUGHT BEHIND THAT --

03:33:59.026 --> 03:33:59.526
IT WAS A IT WAS A COST ISSUE

03:33:59.593 --> 03:34:01.128
OKAY.

03:34:01.195 --> 03:34:02.462
THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER THAT

03:34:02.529 --> 03:34:04.164
ON MY OWN TIME -- I WOULD SAY

03:34:04.231 --> 03:34:05.799
THAT A LOT OF THINGS WE WANT TO

03:34:05.866 --> 03:34:07.601
DO IN THIS BUILDING AND IN OUR

03:34:07.668 --> 03:34:08.936
STATE WE CAN ALWAYS DO IT ONCE

03:34:09.002 --> 03:34:10.637
AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE

03:34:10.704 --> 03:34:12.339
IS AN INCREMENTALISM.

03:34:12.406 --> 03:34:13.807
THAT COMES INTO OUR WORK WHERE

03:34:13.874 --> 03:34:16.076
WE YOU KNOW HAVE TO LIVE MOVE

03:34:16.143 --> 03:34:17.644
THINGS IN A SLOWER PACE BUT IF

03:34:17.711 --> 03:34:18.812
THIS IS IT THE STANDARD IS

03:34:18.879 --> 03:34:19.846
FAIRNESS.

03:34:19.913 --> 03:34:21.782
BUT I THINK THAT -- THE AUTHOR

03:34:21.848 --> 03:34:24.418
IN HIS GOOD WORK AND AND WE AS A

03:34:24.484 --> 03:34:25.953
AS THE ULTIMATE GOVERNING BODY

03:34:26.019 --> 03:34:27.621
SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT

03:34:27.688 --> 03:34:28.989
MAKING SURE THAT SMALL COUNTIES

03:34:29.056 --> 03:34:30.557
LARGE COUNTIES THAT WE TREAT

03:34:30.624 --> 03:34:31.458
THEM THE SAME.

03:34:31.525 --> 03:34:32.726
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT

03:34:32.793 --> 03:34:34.228
EXAMINATION AS THE BILL MOVES

03:34:34.294 --> 03:34:36.363
FORWARD OR AND A SUBSEQUENT YEAR

03:34:36.430 --> 03:34:37.798
BUT I KNOW THAT THE INTENTIONS

03:34:37.864 --> 03:34:40.234
HERE GOOD ONCE AND I'M HAPPY TO

03:34:40.300 --> 03:34:41.702
SUPPORT IT TODAY.

03:34:41.768 --> 03:34:43.637
SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR

03:34:43.704 --> 03:34:47.641
DEBATE.

03:34:47.708 --> 03:34:49.343
SENATOR ALLEN YOU MAKE INCLUDE.

03:34:49.409 --> 03:34:50.177

03:34:52.679 --> 03:34:53.847
SHARE MY MY FRIEND FROM ORANGE

03:34:53.914 --> 03:34:55.882
COUNTY I I WILL SAY THAT -- IN

03:34:55.949 --> 03:34:58.919
THE END OF THE DAY -- ITS LOCAL

03:34:58.986 --> 03:35:00.254
FOLKS ON THE GROUND.

03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:01.355
WE NEED THROUGH A LOCALLY DRIVEN

03:35:01.421 --> 03:35:02.923
PROCESS WHERE THE BOARD WOULD

03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:04.558
HAVE A ROLE ACTUALLY THAT WILL

03:35:04.625 --> 03:35:05.592
BE DRAWN THE LINE IS NOT THE

03:35:05.659 --> 03:35:07.027
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:35:07.094 --> 03:35:07.995
IT'S NOT PEOPLE SACRAMENTO

03:35:08.061 --> 03:35:09.663
DRAWING THE LINES IT'S PEOPLE

03:35:09.730 --> 03:35:11.565
LOCAL TO THAT COUNTY TO THAT

03:35:11.632 --> 03:35:13.634
AREA WHO'D BE ENGAGED IN THE IN

03:35:13.700 --> 03:35:14.901
THE LINE DRY SO IT'S NOT THAT

03:35:14.968 --> 03:35:17.404
THEY'RE THERE THIS IS NOT A IT'S

03:35:17.471 --> 03:35:18.739

03:35:18.805 --> 03:35:19.840
PROCESS.

03:35:19.906 --> 03:35:22.075
BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS ENSURE.

03:35:22.142 --> 03:35:24.578
THAT THE THE MOST SELF

03:35:24.645 --> 03:35:25.979

03:35:26.380 --> 03:35:28.815
WHO BENEFIT OR LOSE -- BASED ON

03:35:28.882 --> 03:35:29.449
THE WAY THE LINES ARE DRAWN ARE

03:35:29.516 --> 03:35:30.951
NOT THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY DRAW

03:35:31.018 --> 03:35:32.486
THE LINES THEMSELVES.

03:35:32.552 --> 03:35:35.289
THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE.

03:35:35.355 --> 03:35:37.024
AND WE LIVE WITH HERE IN THE

03:35:37.090 --> 03:35:38.292

03:35:38.358 --> 03:35:40.027
APPROPRIATE -- THAT IN OUR LARGE

03:35:40.093 --> 03:35:41.461

03:35:41.528 --> 03:35:42.863

IS TO HELP CALIFORNIA HAVE SAFE

03:57:58.263 --> 03:58:00.899
CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND THE

03:58:00.966 --> 03:58:02.334
BUDGET COMMITTEE AND SENATE

03:58:02.401 --> 03:58:04.837
LEADERSHIP AND MY COLLEAGUES.

03:58:04.903 --> 03:58:06.472

WITHOUT A TAX.

03:58:13.712 --> 03:58:15.581
AND SO OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL LEFT

03:58:15.648 --> 03:58:17.049
THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE --

03:58:17.116 --> 03:58:19.218
IN ITS CURRENT FORM BECAUSE OUR

03:58:19.284 --> 03:58:20.619
BUDGET COMMITTEE HAD DONE SUCH A

03:58:20.686 --> 03:58:22.554
GOOD JOB TO FIND RESOURCES IN

03:58:22.621 --> 03:58:25.024
THE GENERAL FUND. TO PAY FOR IT

03:58:25.090 --> 03:58:25.658

03:58:25.724 --> 03:58:27.760
APPROPRIATE THE PASSION IN THE

03:58:27.826 --> 03:58:30.095

03:58:30.162 --> 03:58:32.197
ABOUT THIS BODY TO HAVE THIS

03:58:32.264 --> 03:58:33.632
CONVERSATION ABOUT AN ISSUE TO

WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS BILL

03:58:36.802 --> 03:58:37.870
PROSPECTIVELY WOULD HAVE TO COME

03:58:37.936 --> 03:58:39.972
BACK. FOR A VOTE IF IT HAD ANY

03:58:40.039 --> 03:58:41.273
OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WOULD

03:58:41.340 --> 03:58:42.808
REQUIRE TWO THIRDS SO I THINK

03:58:42.875 --> 03:58:44.810
THERE'S A THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF

03:58:44.877 --> 03:58:46.378
A SAFETY I KNOW IT'S NOT THE

03:58:46.445 --> 03:58:48.447
INTENTION. TO DO ANYTHING BUT

03:58:48.514 --> 03:58:49.915
USE THE GENERAL FUND TO FUND

03:58:49.982 --> 03:58:52.418

03:59:00.426 --> 03:59:02.127
SOLUTION TO SOLVE A PROBLEM

03:59:02.194 --> 03:59:03.195
USING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS

03:59:03.262 --> 03:59:05.597

04:00:33.185 --> 04:00:34.753
SKEPTIC.

IN A CYNIC.

04:00:36.255 --> 04:00:38.624
THAT IS NOT MY NATURE.

04:00:38.690 --> 04:00:40.325

04:00:42.494 --> 04:00:44.196

MIGHT GET REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

04:00:54.873 --> 04:00:56.341

THE BEST YOU'RE GOING TO GET IS

04:00:57.376 --> 04:01:00.212

ONE IMPORTANT [inaudible]

04:01:19.064 --> 04:01:21.466
CONCLUSION.

04:01:29.908 --> 04:01:32.711

04:01:32.778 --> 04:01:36.148
HE'S BEEN A MAN OF TRUTH.

04:01:36.215 --> 04:01:38.250
HE'S BEEN A MAN OF PASSION.

04:01:38.317 --> 04:01:41.253
AND HE'S ALWAYS KEPT HIS WORD.

04:01:41.320 --> 04:01:43.522

DRINKING WATER SHOULD BE A RIGHT.

04:01:58.470 --> 04:01:59.972
NOT A LUXURY.

04:02:00.038 --> 04:02:03.041
BUT A RIGHT.

REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES -- IN THE

04:05:53.472 --> 04:05:54.906

REMAINS WITHOUT THE TAX AND FEE

04:06:04.883 --> 04:06:07.052
THAT IT HAS TODAY -- BUT I THINK

04:06:07.119 --> 04:06:08.086
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE SEND A

OTHERS.

04:06:12.958 --> 04:06:14.326
THAT SHOULD THIS BILL RETURN

WITH A TAX INCREASE OR FEES SUCH

04:06:16.761 --> 04:06:20.398
AS ONE FEARS THAT THERE WILL BE

04:06:39.885 --> 04:06:41.219

THE DOCUMENTARY UNVEILS THE

04:15:21.105 --> 04:15:23.241
COMPLEX WORLD OF THE MULTI

04:15:23.307 --> 04:15:25.309
BILLION DOLLAR COLLEGE SPORTS

04:15:25.376 --> 04:15:26.544
ENTERPRISE.

04:15:26.611 --> 04:15:29.180

04:15:29.247 --> 04:15:31.315
UNPAID STUDENT ATHLETES AND

04:15:31.382 --> 04:15:32.650
THEIR FAMILIES.

04:15:32.717 --> 04:15:35.453
SB TWO ZERO SIX ALLOWS

04:15:35.520 --> 04:15:37.922
CALIFORNIA TO CORRECT THAT

04:15:37.989 --> 04:15:42.060
DEEPLY UNFAIR AND EXPLOITATIVE

04:15:42.126 --> 04:15:43.428
SET OF RULES.

04:15:43.494 --> 04:15:46.497
IT STOPS THE ONE AND ONLY ONE

04:15:46.564 --> 04:15:48.366
CATEGORY OF STUDENTS MEETING THE

04:15:48.433 --> 04:15:49.467

04:15:49.534 --> 04:15:51.636
FROM ANY EARNINGS BASED ON THEIR

04:15:53.438 --> 04:15:55.506
MUSIC MAJORS COMPUTER SCIENCE

FREE TO USE THEIR TALENTS.

04:16:01.312 --> 04:16:04.515
AND IN INCOME NOT COLLEGE

04:16:04.582 --> 04:16:05.717
ATHLETES.

04:16:05.783 --> 04:16:08.586
SB TO THE ZERO SIX DOES NOT

04:16:08.653 --> 04:16:10.755
REQUIRE OUR COLLEGES TO PAY

04:16:10.822 --> 04:16:12.223
ATHLETES DIRECTLY.

04:16:12.290 --> 04:16:15.259
IT'S SIMPLY AFFORDS COLLEGE

04:16:15.326 --> 04:16:18.196
ATHLETES THE SAME RIGHTS THAT

04:16:18.262 --> 04:16:19.997
OLYMPIC ATHLETES ARE GIVEN AND

04:16:20.064 --> 04:16:22.533
NOTE OLYMPIC ATHLETES ARE ALSO

04:16:22.600 --> 04:16:23.901
CONSIDERED IMMATURE.

04:16:23.968 --> 04:16:26.671
SO THIS IS NOT PROFESSIONAL ICE

04:16:26.738 --> 04:16:29.040
OR COLLEGE ATHLETICS AND IN FACT

04:16:29.107 --> 04:16:31.676
MAY RESULT IN ENCOURAGING SOME

04:16:31.743 --> 04:16:33.177
OF OUR STUDENTS TO STAY IN

04:16:33.244 --> 04:16:34.879
SCHOOL RATHER THAN THE

04:16:34.946 --> 04:16:37.181
MOTIVATION TO GO PRO EARLY

04:16:37.248 --> 04:16:40.051
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO

04:16:40.118 --> 04:16:41.786
EARN AN INCOME.

04:16:41.853 --> 04:16:43.287
I'M JUST LIKE OLYMPIC ATHLETES

04:16:43.354 --> 04:16:45.189
SB TWO OH SIX WOULD ALLOW

04:16:45.256 --> 04:16:46.791
STUDENT ATHLETES AND

04:16:46.858 --> 04:16:49.293
CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

04:16:49.360 --> 04:16:51.763
COLLEGES -- TO MAKE EARNINGS

04:16:51.829 --> 04:16:53.698
FROM THEIR NAME IMAGE OR

04:16:53.765 --> 04:16:55.032
LIKENESS.

04:16:55.099 --> 04:16:56.934
IN COMMITTEE WE HEARD PASSIONATE

04:16:57.001 --> 04:17:00.972
TESTIMONY FROM A VOLLEYBALL

04:17:01.038 --> 04:17:02.774
PLAYER AT STANFORD.

04:17:02.840 --> 04:17:04.709
HALEY HUDSON I BRING HER UP

04:17:04.776 --> 04:17:06.077
BECAUSE I IMAGINE MANY PEOPLE

04:17:06.144 --> 04:17:08.513
ARE THINKING THIS BILL PROBABLY

04:17:08.579 --> 04:17:11.082
ONLY BENEFITS.

04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:13.718
THEN THE MEN ATHLETES MEANING

04:17:13.785 --> 04:17:19.023
THE BASKETBALL PLAYERS THE

04:17:19.090 --> 04:17:21.192
WE'VE HEARD ALMOST MORE FROM

04:17:21.259 --> 04:17:22.794
FEMALE ATHLETES.

04:17:22.860 --> 04:17:24.629
AND WHAT HALEY HARD TO DESCRIBE

04:17:24.695 --> 04:17:27.999
SHE WAS THE NUMBER ONE PICK IN

04:17:28.065 --> 04:17:29.433
THE U. S. FOR VOLLEYBALL.

04:17:29.500 --> 04:17:32.470
SHE DECIDED TO ATTEND STANFORD.

04:17:32.537 --> 04:17:33.971
AND APPS STANFORD.

04:17:34.038 --> 04:17:35.540
IN PLAIN.

04:17:35.606 --> 04:17:37.441
SHE WAS INJURED.

04:17:37.508 --> 04:17:39.377
AND DUE TO THAT INJURY SHE HAD

04:17:39.443 --> 04:17:42.313
TO STOP HER ATHLETICS.

04:17:42.380 --> 04:17:44.582
NOW SHE WAS OFFERED BECAUSE SHE

04:17:44.649 --> 04:17:45.716
WAS THE NUMBER ONE FEMALE

04:17:45.783 --> 04:17:48.920
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER IN THE US SHE

04:17:48.986 --> 04:17:51.122
WAS OFFERED -- SPONSORSHIPS AND

04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:53.791
SUCH SHE COULD NOT TAKE THEM AND

04:17:53.858 --> 04:17:55.193
BE ABLE TO PLAY FOR STANFORD.

04:17:55.259 --> 04:17:57.361
AND NOW WITH HER NO LONGER BEING

04:17:57.428 --> 04:17:59.664
ABLE TO PLAY DUE TO HER INJURY

04:17:59.730 --> 04:18:02.366
SHE'S PREVENTED FROM EVER

04:18:02.433 --> 04:18:04.569
GAINING ANY OF THOSE EARNINGS

04:18:04.635 --> 04:18:06.003
THAT SHE MIGHT OF RECOUP.

04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:08.272
FROM HER ATHLETIC TALENTS NOW I

04:18:08.339 --> 04:18:10.274
GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF MISSY

04:18:10.341 --> 04:18:12.210

04:18:16.447 --> 04:18:17.982
OLYMPIC RIGHTS.

04:18:18.049 --> 04:18:19.383

04:18:25.356 --> 04:18:27.592
AND SHE DECIDED TO SWIM ALL FOUR

04:18:27.658 --> 04:18:30.261
YEARS AND FOR GO HER RIGHT TO

04:18:30.328 --> 04:18:32.129
MAKE ANY MONEY FROM.

04:18:32.196 --> 04:18:35.633
WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO AS AN

04:18:35.700 --> 04:18:36.500
OLYMPIC ATHLETE.

04:18:36.567 --> 04:18:37.668
AT THE END OF HER CAL CAREER SHE

04:18:37.735 --> 04:18:39.637
INJURED HERSELF SHE IS NOW NOT

04:18:39.704 --> 04:18:42.139
BEING ABLE TO GO PRO SHE CAN

04:18:42.206 --> 04:18:43.674
MAKE NO MONEYOFF FOR TALENT.

04:18:43.741 --> 04:18:45.543
KATIE LEDECKY WHO SWAM FOR

04:18:45.610 --> 04:18:48.546

OLYMPIC RIGHTS TO MAKE MONEY.

04:18:57.288 --> 04:19:00.324
SO SB TWO ZERO SIX JUST ALLOWS

04:19:02.460 --> 04:19:03.895

OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES HAVE GOT

IN THE SPIRIT.

04:20:22.273 --> 04:20:24.342
THE DEDICATION OF COMPETITION TO

04:20:24.408 --> 04:20:26.877
AMATEURISM.

04:20:26.944 --> 04:20:29.013

NOT LIKE CALIFORNIA ONLY BILLS

BUT THIS IS A SITUATION THAT

04:20:59.810 --> 04:21:01.112
CRIES OUT FOR JUSTICE.

04:21:01.178 --> 04:21:02.413
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE NC

04:21:02.480 --> 04:21:04.882
DOUBLE A IS A BILLION DOLLAR

04:21:04.949 --> 04:21:06.550

BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT.

04:21:09.720 --> 04:21:10.988

BOWLS THE MOST ICONIC AMERICAN

04:21:12.356 --> 04:21:14.158
SPORTING EVENT I THINK IT'S THE

04:21:14.225 --> 04:21:16.060
BASKETBLL TOURNAMENT.

04:21:16.127 --> 04:21:18.963

CLOTHES AND AND NOT PROPERLY

04:21:28.639 --> 04:21:30.541
TAKEN CARE OF SO WITH THE TAX

04:21:30.608 --> 04:21:31.909
MATTERS IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATS

04:21:31.976 --> 04:21:32.877

PRIZE AND THE WAY TO DO THAT I

04:23:26.357 --> 04:23:27.558
THOUGHT WAS TO DELAY THE

THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

04:23:39.370 --> 04:23:41.272

THAT IS THE PRESSURE THAT WE

04:23:48.279 --> 04:23:50.548

THAT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION

04:23:59.156 --> 04:24:00.758
BECAUSE IT GETS TO THE SPIRIT OF

UNDERGRADS BUT 50% OF THE

04:24:35.426 --> 04:24:38.395
FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL TEAMS.

04:24:38.462 --> 04:24:40.931
THESE MEN AND WOMEN PUT **** IN

04:24:40.998 --> 04:24:43.400
THE SEATS OF ARENAS AND STADIUMS

04:24:43.467 --> 04:24:45.202
ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:46.670
THEY MAKE THE UNIVERSITY TO MAKE

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SELLING

04:24:48.639 --> 04:24:50.274

THESE ATHLETES BENEFIT NOT.

04:25:00.517 --> 04:25:03.754

04:25:03.821 --> 04:25:05.322
SPORTS FOLKS THIS IS A CIVIL

04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:06.323

04:25:08.726 --> 04:25:11.161
A BOUT PEEN OUR ALLOWING SOMEONE

04:25:11.228 --> 04:25:12.863
TO MAKE A LIVING I WENT TO

04:25:12.930 --> 04:25:15.032
COLLEGE WITH A LOT OF GUYS WHO.

04:25:15.099 --> 04:25:16.934
PLAYED SPORTS AND THEY STRUGGLED

04:25:17.001 --> 04:25:19.303
I MEAN THEY STRUGGLE.

04:25:19.370 --> 04:25:21.305
TO STAINED GLASS IN IT DESPITE

04:25:21.372 --> 04:25:23.107
HAVING A SCHOLARSHIP AND I%

04:25:23.173 --> 04:25:24.742
COULDN'T EARN EXTRA MONEY

04:25:24.808 --> 04:25:26.410
COULDN'T TAKE JOBS.

04:25:26.477 --> 04:25:28.312
DURING THE SEASONS AND THEY LOOK

04:25:28.379 --> 04:25:30.447
REALLY STRUGGLE BUT NOW YOU HAVE

04:25:30.514 --> 04:25:33.050
COLLEGE COACHES MAKING MILLIONS

04:25:33.117 --> 04:25:34.318
OF DOLLARS.

04:25:34.385 --> 04:25:36.186
THESE COLLEGE COACH MILLIONAIRES

04:25:36.253 --> 04:25:37.855
ARE GOING INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S

04:25:37.921 --> 04:25:39.390
HOMES RECRUITING AND WITH THE

04:25:39.456 --> 04:25:41.258
PROMISE OF ALL THE WHAT THE

04:25:41.325 --> 04:25:43.827
UNIVERSITY HAS TO OFFER AND MANY

04:25:43.894 --> 04:25:44.194
TIMES.

04:25:44.261 --> 04:25:45.362
AGAIN.

04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:46.730
VERY FEW OF THESE FOLKS EVER

04:25:46.797 --> 04:25:48.032
MAKE IT TO THE PROFESSIONAL

04:25:48.098 --> 04:25:50.000
LEVEL SO I THINK THEY SHOULD GET

04:25:50.067 --> 04:25:51.935
THEIR DO WHILE THEY'RE STILL

04:25:52.002 --> 04:25:53.337
PLAYING AT THESE COLLEGE THAT'S

04:25:53.404 --> 04:25:54.805
WHY A LOT OF THESE YOUNG MEN.

04:25:54.872 --> 04:25:56.407
LEAVE COLLEGE EARLY FOR

04:25:56.473 --> 04:25:58.642
FINANCIAL GAIN I THINK THIS WITH

04:25:58.709 --> 04:26:00.110
A SET OF EYES AND TO STAY AND

04:26:00.177 --> 04:26:02.413
GRADUATE BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF

04:26:02.479 --> 04:26:06.283
THEM DON'T.

04:26:06.350 --> 04:26:08.118
DON'T GRADUATE AND I THINK.

04:26:08.185 --> 04:26:09.520
I WISH THIS BILL WHEN IT EVEN

04:26:09.586 --> 04:26:10.888

A CONTINUATION OF EDUCATION AS

04:26:15.059 --> 04:26:15.993
LONG AS THEY WANT TO ONE THEY

04:26:16.060 --> 04:26:17.761
GOT UNDERGRAD DEGREE GET A

04:26:17.828 --> 04:26:19.430
MASTERS DEGREE GET A PHD I THINK

04:26:19.496 --> 04:26:20.364
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO

04:26:20.431 --> 04:26:22.132
SCHOOL FOR LIFE AT THOSE

04:26:22.199 --> 04:26:24.635
UNIVERSES WHICH THEY PAY SO.

04:26:24.702 --> 04:26:25.235

FORTH.

04:26:42.953 --> 04:26:44.555
AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WHY

04:26:44.621 --> 04:26:46.390
BECAUSE I HAVE A SON WHO

04:26:46.457 --> 04:26:48.359
GRADUATED FROM U. S. SEED PLAYED

04:26:48.425 --> 04:26:49.993
ON THE USC FOOTBALL TEAM.

04:26:50.060 --> 04:26:51.228
AND HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:26:51.295 --> 04:26:53.097
PLAY WITH A GREAT USC PLAYERS

04:26:53.163 --> 04:26:55.299
AND HE WOULD SHARE STORIES.

04:26:55.366 --> 04:26:56.767
HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR SOME OF

04:26:56.834 --> 04:26:58.135
THESE PLAYERS AND AND HOW

04:26:58.202 --> 04:27:00.070

SOFTBALL TEAM.

04:27:05.476 --> 04:27:06.777
AND SHE SHARED ALL HER

04:27:06.844 --> 04:27:08.312
OPPORTUNITIES BUT AT THE SAME

04:27:08.379 --> 04:27:10.381
TIME ALSO SHARED THOSE WHO

04:27:10.447 --> 04:27:12.316
DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY SO I

04:27:12.383 --> 04:27:14.017
SEE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY OF

04:27:14.084 --> 04:27:16.253
FAIRNESS REPRESENTATION.

04:27:16.320 --> 04:27:17.821

INTO THE FUTURE SO IT'S A IT'S

04:27:28.232 --> 04:27:29.867
AN OPPORTUNITY OUT FOR US TO

04:27:48.452 --> 04:27:49.987
GOOD POINTS TODAY.

04:27:50.053 --> 04:27:51.422
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT OUR OUR

04:27:51.488 --> 04:27:53.157
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THEIR

04:27:53.223 --> 04:27:55.359
PRIMARY TASK TO BE TO PROVIDE A

04:27:55.426 --> 04:27:58.462
QUALITY EDUCATION FOR OUR KIDS.

04:27:58.529 --> 04:28:03.600
AND SECONDARILY -- TO ALLOW THEM.

04:28:03.667 --> 04:28:04.668
TO USE THEIR WONDERFUL ATHLETIC --

04:28:04.735 --> 04:28:07.571
SKILLS -- THERE'S NO QUESTION

04:28:07.638 --> 04:28:09.206
THAT MANY OF OUR UNIVERSITIES --

04:28:09.273 --> 04:28:11.475
DO VERY WELL WHEN THEY HAVE SOME

04:28:11.542 --> 04:28:12.743
LOCAL STARS WHETHER IN

04:28:12.810 --> 04:28:14.578
BASKETBALL FOOTBALL TRACK.

04:28:20.717 --> 04:28:22.686
EDUCATION IN THOSE COLLEGES AND

04:28:22.753 --> 04:28:24.655
UNIVERSITIES.

04:28:24.721 --> 04:28:25.856
THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH THIS

04:28:25.923 --> 04:28:28.659
BILL IS IT IS CALIFORNIA CENTRIC.

04:28:28.725 --> 04:28:30.227
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE A BILL

04:28:30.294 --> 04:28:32.162
MORE APPROPRIATE TO BE

04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:34.097
ENTERTAINED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

04:28:34.164 --> 04:28:36.133
THE NC A A IS A NATIONAL

04:28:36.200 --> 04:28:38.635

BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPTED

04:32:35.038 --> 04:32:35.272
[inaudible]

04:32:35.338 --> 04:32:39.910
AS WITH GREAT SCANDALS.

04:32:39.976 --> 04:32:41.344
SOME OF THEM RIGHT NOW IN A

04:32:41.411 --> 04:32:43.580

04:32:53.290 --> 04:32:55.926
OUT FROM THE SHADOWS.

04:32:55.992 --> 04:32:57.594
AND THAT WE DID PUT SOME RULES

04:32:57.661 --> 04:33:00.063
AND REGULATIONS WE KNOW THAT IN

04:33:00.130 --> 04:33:01.698
SOME OF THE TOP.

04:33:01.765 --> 04:33:03.800
UNIVERSITIES IN FOOTBALL AND

04:33:03.867 --> 04:33:06.303
BASKETBALL AND OTHER SPORTS.

04:33:06.369 --> 04:33:09.306
THERE ARE EFFORTS AND CREATIVE

04:33:09.372 --> 04:33:11.408
EFFORTS I MIGHT SAY. TO TRY TO

04:33:11.475 --> 04:33:13.710
CIRCUMVENT THE RULES OF AMATEUR

04:33:13.777 --> 04:33:14.911

04:33:16.179 --> 04:33:17.581
UNTIL FINALLY THEY SAID OKAY WE

04:33:17.647 --> 04:33:19.049
GIVE UP.

OF WE WE'RE NOT GOING TO INSIST

04:33:21.752 --> 04:33:22.753

POVERTY IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN

04:33:26.490 --> 04:33:27.591
THE ATHLETICS.

04:33:27.657 --> 04:33:28.759
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT

04:33:28.825 --> 04:33:29.793
SPORTS.

04:33:29.860 --> 04:33:31.628
IN COLLEGE SPORTS STARTED TAKING

04:33:31.695 --> 04:33:33.497
A REAL HONEST LOOK AT WHAT

04:33:33.563 --> 04:33:36.133
ATHLETICS MEAN TO THE SCHOOLS.

04:33:36.199 --> 04:33:37.400
WHAT THEY MEAN TO OUR STUDENT

04:33:37.467 --> 04:33:39.002
ATHLETES THAT OUR STUDENT

04:33:39.069 --> 04:33:41.138
ATHLETES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:33:41.204 --> 04:33:43.340
ENJOY SOME OF THE BENEFITS BUT I

04:33:43.406 --> 04:33:44.775
ALSO CAUTION?

04:33:44.841 --> 04:33:45.976
THAT UNLESS THERE'S SOME

04:33:46.042 --> 04:33:47.210
REGULATION.

04:33:47.277 --> 04:33:48.645
AND MANY OF US HERE HAVE HEARD

04:33:48.712 --> 04:33:50.647
HORROR STORIES ABOUT SPORTS

04:33:50.714 --> 04:33:51.982
AGENTS.

04:33:52.048 --> 04:33:53.650
HOW THEY HAVE MANIPULATED

04:33:53.717 --> 04:33:55.485
PARTICULARLY YOUNG?

04:33:55.552 --> 04:33:58.421
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

04:33:58.488 --> 04:34:00.123
AND YOUNG ATHLETES IN GENERAL.

04:34:00.190 --> 04:34:02.826
AND USE THE MEN MANIPULATED THEM

04:34:02.893 --> 04:34:05.595
TO THEIR OWN GREED AND ADVANTAGE

04:34:05.662 --> 04:34:07.798
LEAVING THOSE STUDENT ATHLETES

04:34:07.864 --> 04:34:09.566

04:34:14.237 --> 04:34:16.439
AGENTS SO AS WE GO FORWARD AND I

YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FROM THE

04:34:27.684 --> 04:34:28.718
CHALLENGES THAT THEY WILL

BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE

04:34:46.002 --> 04:34:47.604
WITHOUT BEING MANIPULATED AND

04:34:47.671 --> 04:34:49.272
USED BY THOSE WHO ARE MORE

04:34:49.339 --> 04:34:52.409
SOPHISTICATED IN OTHER TYPES OF

MORE WORLDLY BEHAVIORS CAESAR

04:34:54.110 --> 04:34:55.846
ATHLETES AND I CAN SAY I HAVE A

04:34:55.912 --> 04:34:57.247
GRANDSON WHO IS.

04:34:57.314 --> 04:34:59.482
FINISHING UP. FOUR YEAR COLLEGE

SCHOLARSHIP TO A MAJOR

04:35:00.650 --> 04:35:02.619
UNIVERSITY WENT TO THE NC TWO

04:35:02.686 --> 04:35:05.021
WAYS AS A STARTING GUARD ON HIS

04:35:05.088 --> 04:35:06.389
BASKETBALL TEAM.

04:35:06.456 --> 04:35:07.958
THESE KIDS.

04:35:08.024 --> 04:35:10.227
AS YOUNG PEOPLE WORK HARD.

04:35:10.293 --> 04:35:11.962
THEIR PARENTS WERE CARDS SO THAT

04:35:12.028 --> 04:35:14.731
THEY CAN GET THE ADVANTAGES OF

04:35:14.798 --> 04:35:16.533
THE CLUBS IN THE KINDS OF

04:35:16.600 --> 04:35:18.702
EXPERTISE THEY NEED IN ORDER TO

04:35:18.768 --> 04:35:21.037
BECOME GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO.

04:35:21.104 --> 04:35:24.474
BUT THEY ARE NOT SOPHISTICATED

04:35:24.541 --> 04:35:26.509
IN THE WORLD OUT THERE AND THEY

04:35:26.576 --> 04:35:29.880
ARE OFTEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OF

04:35:29.946 --> 04:35:31.248
FORTUNATELY I HAVE A GRANDSON

04:35:32.782 --> 04:35:33.617
SHOULDERS.

04:35:33.683 --> 04:35:36.052
BUT NOT EVERY YOUNG PERSON IS

04:35:36.119 --> 04:35:37.821
ABLE TO TRAVERSE THESE VERY

04:35:37.888 --> 04:35:40.223
TRICKY WATERS AND SO AS WE GO

04:35:40.290 --> 04:35:42.425
FORWARD AS WE GIVE THESE YOUNG

04:35:42.492 --> 04:35:44.160
PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE

04:35:44.227 --> 04:35:45.528
SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF THEIR

HARD WORK IN THEIR TALENT.

04:35:46.930 --> 04:35:48.131
WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THEY

04:35:48.198 --> 04:35:52.469
CANNOT DO THIS ALONE AND WITH

BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP I I WILL

04:36:02.479 --> 04:36:04.314
ADMIT THAT -- WHEN I FIRST HEARD

04:36:04.381 --> 04:36:05.782
ABOUT THE BILL AS IT CAME TO

04:36:05.849 --> 04:36:07.651

04:36:12.155 --> 04:36:15.425
UNIVERSITIES ABOUT THIS BILL --

04:36:15.492 --> 04:36:17.294
BUT WHEN THEY WERE SITTING

04:36:17.360 --> 04:36:18.495
BEFORE US IN EDUCATION COMMITTEE

04:36:18.561 --> 04:36:20.430

04:36:20.497 --> 04:36:21.898
YOU YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU

04:36:21.965 --> 04:36:24.067
DON'T WANT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT

04:36:24.134 --> 04:36:25.869
WOULD VIOLATE NC DOUBLE A RULES

04:36:25.936 --> 04:36:26.903
AND OUT OF COURSE AFFECT JOCK

04:36:26.970 --> 04:36:29.139
BUT PROGRAMS BUT YOU INHERENTLY.

04:36:29.205 --> 04:36:31.408
AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WHAT THE

04:36:31.474 --> 04:36:33.109
BILL ACTUALLY PROPOSES THAT

04:36:33.176 --> 04:36:34.744
ACTUALLY STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE

04:36:34.811 --> 04:36:38.682
THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE -- TO

04:36:38.748 --> 04:36:42.152
BENEFITS -- FOR FROM THEIR OWN

04:36:42.218 --> 04:36:43.453
ACTUALLY EFFORTS.

04:36:43.520 --> 04:36:44.587
AND FOR MOST PARTY ON THERE MAY

04:36:44.654 --> 04:36:45.188
BE SOME TWEAKS OR SOMETHING I

04:36:45.255 --> 04:36:46.256
SAID NOW WE DON'T ACTUALLY

04:36:46.323 --> 04:36:47.357
DISAGREE WITH THAT AND THEN I

04:36:47.424 --> 04:36:48.725
ASK THEM SAID WELL THE NC DOUBLE

04:36:48.792 --> 04:36:51.027
A WHICH MAKES THE RULES IS

04:36:51.094 --> 04:36:53.229
ACTUALLY A GROUP OF COLLEGES AND

04:36:53.296 --> 04:36:53.897
UNIVERSITIES IN.

04:36:53.964 --> 04:36:55.598
THE BOARD IS COMPOSED OF COLLEGE

04:36:55.665 --> 04:36:58.101
PRESIDENTS SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

04:36:58.168 --> 04:37:00.136
THE CHANGE THAT CIRCUMSTANCE.

04:37:00.203 --> 04:37:00.770
IT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MUCH OF AN

04:37:00.837 --> 04:37:02.505
ANSWER TO THAT.

04:37:02.572 --> 04:37:03.974
AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

04:37:04.040 --> 04:37:05.575
IMPORTANT WE SET THIS TABLE I

04:37:05.642 --> 04:37:07.143
WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT IF YOU HAVE

04:37:07.210 --> 04:37:09.112
A COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WROTE A

04:37:09.179 --> 04:37:10.780
WONDERFUL SONG.

04:37:10.847 --> 04:37:12.682
AND IT TOOK OFF ON A STREAMING

04:37:12.749 --> 04:37:14.718
SERVICE OR SOMETHING.

04:37:14.784 --> 04:37:15.352
ARE THEY WOULD GET ROYALTIES FOR

04:37:15.418 --> 04:37:17.220
THAT.

04:37:17.287 --> 04:37:18.989
RIGHT -- SOMEONE WHO'S A YOUTUBE

04:37:19.055 --> 04:37:20.757
STAR MAY BE DOING I DON'T KNOW

04:37:20.824 --> 04:37:23.493
CAUSE MEDICS OR SOMETHING LIKE

04:37:23.560 --> 04:37:23.693
THAT.

04:37:23.760 --> 04:37:25.095
I I WILL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S ON

04:37:25.161 --> 04:37:26.763
YOU TOO BUT THEY COULD PROBABLY

04:37:26.830 --> 04:37:28.498
ACTUALLY MONETIZE AND NOT HAVE

04:37:28.565 --> 04:37:30.200
TO LEAVE SCHOOL.

04:37:30.266 --> 04:37:30.967
RIGHT I MEAN IT'S THEIR CHOICE

04:37:31.034 --> 04:37:31.968
WHERE THEY WANT TO OR NOT.

04:37:32.035 --> 04:37:35.605
BUT THESE ATHLETES ARE ACTUALLY --

04:37:35.672 --> 04:37:37.474
TOLD THAT THEY CANNOT BENEFIT

04:37:37.540 --> 04:37:39.876
FROM THEIR OWN IMAGE FROM THERE

04:37:39.943 --> 04:37:41.845
AND NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT BENEFIT

04:37:41.911 --> 04:37:43.446
FROM IT THE SCHOOL CERTAINLY

04:37:43.513 --> 04:37:44.981
BENEFITS FROM IT THE SCHOOL

04:37:45.048 --> 04:37:46.883
MARKETS IT HEAVILY.

04:37:46.950 --> 04:37:48.184
AND I THINK THIS IS.

04:37:48.251 --> 04:37:50.720
FRANKLY UNFAIR AND IN JACK'S --

04:37:50.787 --> 04:37:52.756
THROUGH THEIR OWN EFFORTS SO I

04:37:52.822 --> 04:37:55.725
AGREE WITH MY BRENDA WHO TALKS

04:37:55.792 --> 04:37:56.726
ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

04:37:56.793 --> 04:37:57.994
WE DO NEED TO HAVE SOME

04:37:58.061 --> 04:37:59.129
GUIDELINES RIGHT WE WANT TO SEE

04:37:59.195 --> 04:38:00.830
IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BUT I

04:38:00.897 --> 04:38:01.998
THINK THE IDEA THAT.

04:38:02.065 --> 04:38:03.500
STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

04:38:03.566 --> 04:38:04.934
BENEFIT FROM THEIR OWN TALENTS

04:38:05.001 --> 04:38:06.202
AND EFFORT.

04:38:06.269 --> 04:38:06.736
I JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE IN

04:38:06.803 --> 04:38:08.571
ATHLETICS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

04:38:08.638 --> 04:38:09.906
NEED TO CHANGE WE NEED TO

04:38:09.973 --> 04:38:11.808
CHALLENGE OUR UNIVERSITIES AND

04:38:11.875 --> 04:38:15.612
COLLEGES TO MAKE THAT CHANGE --

04:38:15.679 --> 04:38:18.381
AND TO FIGHT FOR THAT AND SO --

04:38:18.448 --> 04:38:20.083
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:21.651
IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA ISSUES

04:38:21.718 --> 04:38:22.585
A BROADER ISSUE.

04:38:22.652 --> 04:38:24.988
BUT CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA NEEDS

04:38:25.055 --> 04:38:27.290
TO LEAD WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR

04:38:27.357 --> 04:38:28.291
STUDENTS.

04:38:28.358 --> 04:38:29.159
THE STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE

04:38:29.225 --> 04:38:30.994
OPPORTUNITY TO JUST LIKE ANY

04:38:31.061 --> 04:38:37.133
OTHER STUDENTS -- BENEFIT

04:38:37.200 --> 04:38:40.904

HI MY A I'M WE ARE PART OF THE

04:38:52.482 --> 04:38:54.084
STATE LEGISLATIVE BODY I'M NOT

04:38:55.552 --> 04:38:57.987
COLLEGIAN ORGANIZATION SITE I

04:38:58.054 --> 04:38:58.988
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE

04:38:59.055 --> 04:39:00.490
AUTHOR IF I COULD JUST TO

04:39:00.557 --> 04:39:02.392

MATRICES SENATOR I BEING TOLD --

04:39:09.632 --> 04:39:11.101
YOU KNOW THAT.

04:39:11.167 --> 04:39:13.403
IF WE IF WE DO SOMETHING UNIQUE

04:39:13.470 --> 04:39:14.737
AND DIFFERENT THAT WERE.

04:39:14.804 --> 04:39:16.005
WE WE WE WOULD BE TREATED

04:39:16.072 --> 04:39:17.841
UNFAVORABLY OR WE COULD BE

04:39:17.907 --> 04:39:18.942
PENALIZED.

04:39:19.008 --> 04:39:21.578
AND SO WHAT WHAT COULD THE NC A

04:39:21.644 --> 04:39:23.046
A DUE TO CALIFORNIA COULD

04:39:23.113 --> 04:39:24.848
EXCLUDE THE CAMPUSES IN

04:39:24.914 --> 04:39:26.416
CALIFORNIA FROM ITS.

04:39:26.483 --> 04:39:31.488
NETWORK OF ORGANIZED SPORTS.

04:39:31.554 --> 04:39:33.857
PERMISSION ANSWER THE CONCERN BY

04:39:33.923 --> 04:39:35.625
SOME OF OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

04:39:35.692 --> 04:39:38.228
COLLEGES IS THAT THE N. C. TWO

04:39:38.294 --> 04:39:38.928
WAY.

04:39:38.995 --> 04:39:42.432
WOULD -- RETALIATE BECAUSE UNDER

04:39:42.499 --> 04:39:45.335
THIS BILL IF STUDENTS WERE Q.

04:39:45.401 --> 04:39:47.003
AND BE ABLE TO GAIN SOME

04:39:47.070 --> 04:39:48.271
EARNINGS OFF THEIR IMAGE OR

04:39:48.338 --> 04:39:49.973
LIKENESS THAT THAT WOULD BE A

04:39:50.039 --> 04:39:51.474
VIOLATION OF THE RULES THAT THE

04:39:51.541 --> 04:39:53.910
AND SEE TO A HAS PUT INTO PLACE.

04:39:53.977 --> 04:39:56.980
NOW THE BILL IS EXPLICITLY%

04:39:57.046 --> 04:40:02.452
WRITTEN. TO IN FACT -- DIRECT.

04:40:02.519 --> 04:40:03.653
WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE THE

04:40:03.720 --> 04:40:05.522
JURISDICTION OVER THE NC TWO

04:40:05.588 --> 04:40:06.422
WEIGH.

04:40:06.489 --> 04:40:08.758
IT DEFINITELY ADDS PROTECTIONS

04:40:08.825 --> 04:40:10.593
TO THE COLLEGES BUT EFFICIENCY

04:40:10.660 --> 04:40:13.463
TO A WERE TO CHOOSE TO THAT

04:40:13.530 --> 04:40:14.797
COULD CONCEIVABLY HAPPEN.

04:40:14.864 --> 04:40:18.301
BUT I THINK THE BENEFIT OF THE

04:40:18.368 --> 04:40:20.270
BOTH THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION

04:40:20.336 --> 04:40:22.939
AND THE FACT THAT WILL AND I

04:40:23.006 --> 04:40:24.841
WILL GIVE THIS INFORMATION TO MY

04:40:24.908 --> 04:40:27.610
CLOTHES THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE

04:40:27.677 --> 04:40:28.811
OTHER FRONTS.

04:40:28.878 --> 04:40:31.314
NOW INFLUENCING THE NC TWO EIGHT

04:40:31.381 --> 04:40:33.049
TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION I FEEL

04:40:33.116 --> 04:40:33.983
THAT.

04:40:34.050 --> 04:40:36.753
OUR WHATEVER FEARS OUR PRIVATE

04:40:36.819 --> 04:40:39.556
AND PUBLIC COLLEGES MAY HAVE.

04:40:39.622 --> 04:40:41.824
ON MAY PROVE TO BE ON WARRANTED.

04:40:41.891 --> 04:40:45.094
SO WE HAVE A CHESS GAME GOING ON

04:40:45.161 --> 04:40:47.130
AND WE'RE MAKING A POTENTIAL

04:40:47.197 --> 04:40:48.264
MOVE.

04:40:48.331 --> 04:40:51.467
AND IF THE NC A A SAYS FINE YOU

04:40:51.534 --> 04:40:52.702
TAKE THAT POSITION WE WILL

04:40:52.769 --> 04:40:55.004
EXCLUDE CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES

04:40:55.071 --> 04:40:55.305
[inaudible]

04:40:55.371 --> 04:40:59.075
FROM OUR CALENDAR.

04:40:59.142 --> 04:41:01.244
THEN WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO THE

04:41:01.311 --> 04:41:02.745
POTENTIAL SPONSORSHIPS.

04:41:02.812 --> 04:41:05.148
OF THE STUDENTS WERE TRYING

04:41:05.215 --> 04:41:05.448
[inaudible]

04:41:05.515 --> 04:41:09.118
TO ASSIST.

04:41:09.185 --> 04:41:12.121
THIS IS SPECULATIVE -- AND

04:41:12.188 --> 04:41:14.791
CERTAINLY -- WE HAS THE

04:41:14.857 --> 04:41:16.693
LEGISLATURE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

04:41:16.759 --> 04:41:18.428
MODIFY.

04:41:18.494 --> 04:41:20.730
OUR LAWS IF THERE ARE

04:41:20.797 --> 04:41:24.200
CONSEQUENCES THAT WE THINK ARE --

04:41:24.267 --> 04:41:26.236
WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT.

04:41:26.302 --> 04:41:27.937
BUT AS I INDICATED THERE IS

04:41:28.004 --> 04:41:29.906
ENOUGH MOMENTUM AROUND THIS

04:41:29.973 --> 04:41:31.674
ISSUE AND ANY OF US WHO ARE

04:41:31.741 --> 04:41:35.645
SPORTS FANS YOU WILL NOTICE THAT --

04:41:35.712 --> 04:41:37.013
IT IS ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR

04:41:37.080 --> 04:41:39.482
TOPICS ON ESPN.

04:41:39.549 --> 04:41:42.151
IT HAS BEEN NOW FOR A COUPLE OF

04:41:42.218 --> 04:41:42.352
YEARS.

04:41:42.418 --> 04:41:43.920
OKAY.

04:41:43.987 --> 04:41:45.288
THEN -- I HAD A FEW MORE

04:41:45.355 --> 04:41:46.289
QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE IT JUST

04:41:46.356 --> 04:41:48.324

RIGHT IT'S MORE RESPONSIVE

04:43:55.918 --> 04:43:57.220
