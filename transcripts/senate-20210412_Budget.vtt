ARE WAY BEHIND THE CURVE. THIS

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.691
IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET BUT

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:53.458
IT'S ACTUALLY WE'RE DOING

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:54.359
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:56.127
POSITIVE FOR CALIFORNIA AND-

00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:57.429
THE EARLIER WE GET ON THE

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:59.397
GROUND. THE BETTER TO WE HAVE

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:00.765
THE ABILITY TO DO IT IN BEFORE

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:01.933
WE GET INTO FIRE SEASON WHERE

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.901
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THESE

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:04.569
PROJECTS WHEN IT'S HOT DROUGHT

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:05.503
TO BECAUSE ACTUALLY DOING THE

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.405

WE GET TO THE AGENCIES THAT ARE

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:14.246

EMPHASIS ON HARDENING AND

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:30.729
PREVENTION AND I'M AS A SOMEONE

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:31.796

TWO RECENT FIRES WITH BOND AND

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:39.004
SILVERADO WITHIN ONE MONTH OF

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.572
EACH OTHER- I THINK IT'S

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.340
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:44.442
LOCALIZED NATURE FIRE RISKS-

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:47.012
BUT I WANTED TO. ASK YOU ABOUT-

00:25:47.078 --> 00:25:48.413
MY BUDGET REQUESTS FOR A LITTLE

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.116
WHILE FIRE- AD PHASE TWO

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:52.684
EXPANSION I UNDERSTAND THE

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:54.452
ALERT WILDFIRE PHASE ONE WAS

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:55.620
SEEN AS TREMENDOUS SUCCESS

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:57.923
SUCCESSFUL- THE INSTALLATION OF

00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:00.292
HUNDREDS OF CAMERAS IN. FIRE

00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:01.793
PRONE AREAS ACROSS THE STATE

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.561
HAS PROVIDED FIRST RESPONDERS

00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:05.397
WITH- YOU KNOW EARLY NOTICE OF

00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:07.565
WHEN FIRES ARE OCCURRING- AND

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:09.467
THAT'S I THINK SAVED A LOT OF

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:11.970
LIVES SAVED A LOT OF PROPERTY-

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:13.939
BUT FACE TO AS I UNDERSTAND IT

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:14.506
WOULD WOULD PROVIDE DIGITAL

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:17.509
MAPS. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO

00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:19.010
BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:21.479
ARE FIRE RISKS WHERE FIRES

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:23.548
MIGHT HEAD- WHERE WE MIGHT

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:25.250
FOCUS OUR FUEL REDUCTION

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:26.685
EFFORTS AND ALSO ALLOWING FIRST

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:29.254

00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:30.755
OUT WHERE TO DEPLOY THEIR

00:26:30.822 --> 00:26:32.657
RESOURCES WHEN FIRES ARE RAGING

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:33.825
ALL OF THIS I UNDERSTAND WILL

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:36.361
SAVE LIVES AND- THE COST OF

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.395
THIS PROGRAM AT TWENTY FIVE

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:39.364

DEALING WITH SCARCE RESOURCES

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.102
BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE- SOMETHING

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:45.804
THAT IS A NO BRAINER JUST

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.772
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL IT HAS

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:49.240

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:39.490
THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. STILL

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:40.891
I'M OBJECTING AND I THINK THAT

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.127
THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS IN

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:47.665
HERE THAT I THINK- OUGHT NOT BE.

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:49.667
YOU SEE IF THERE'S THE OTHER

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:50.267
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:53.638
LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:55.773
BUT THOUGHT I BOUGHT HAD SOME

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.176
ANGST ABOUT. THIS BILL JUST ON

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.845
THE BASIS THAT I AM NOT.

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:03.080
CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE AT THE

00:38:03.147 --> 00:38:06.250
LOCAL LEVEL ARE FULLY AWARE OF.

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:08.753
THE FACT THAT THIS IS MOVING-

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:10.688
PARTICULARLY SINCE I KNOW AND-

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.256
IT AND NOW ONE OF MY DISTRICT

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:13.958
COUNTIES MONTEREY THERE'S A BIG

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:17.695
DEBATE- ABOUT THIS GOING ON AND

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:18.763
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ANYONE IN

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.364
MONTEREY COUNTY AND SO THAT

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:23.434
GAVE ME CONCERNED. I THINK OUR

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.469
OUR I ALSO MET A DISADVANTAGE

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:26.871
IN THAT THIS WAS THOROUGHLY

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:30.508
DEBATED- BEFORE I WAS HERE. IN

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:33.210
THE SENATE. AND THE GOVERNOR

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:35.880
VETOED IT BUT HE LAID OUT

00:38:35.946 --> 00:38:37.515
THINGS IN THIS BILL CLEARLY

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:39.316
ADDRESSES EACH OF THOSE AFTER

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:41.419
THAT THOROUGH DEBATE WHETHER IT

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.689
IS. A SUNSET THAT DIDN'T EXIST

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:46.157
WHETHER IT'S REALLY TIED

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.025
COVERED WHICH WAS DIFFERENT

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:49.627
THAN WHETHER IT REMOVES THE

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.929
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SO

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:54.298
WHILE I WISH THIS WAS MOVING IN

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:56.467
A WAY. THAT I COULD HEAR FROM

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.502
LOCALS AND THEY WERE FULLY

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:01.439
AWARE OF IT- I THINK THAT THAT

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.040
GIVES ME ENOUGH OF A COMFORT

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:07.511
LEVEL TO MOVE IT ALONG. FIVE

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:09.046
SENATOR DOLLY I GOT YOU BUT LET

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:11.982
ME HAVE SENATOR DRAWS SO FIRST

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:12.616
THAT WAS THE NEXT DAY AND I SAW

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:18.756
IT UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I

00:39:18.823 --> 00:39:20.224
JUST WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:24.729
THE- ISSUES BEFORE US THIS WAS

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:27.665
A BILL THAT WAS FULLY DEBATED

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:31.302
THOROUGHLY DEBATED. LAST YEAR

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:34.305
WHEN WE WERE IN THE WORST PART

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:36.273
I THINK OF OUR OF OUR PANDEMIC

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.743
OF CONCERN ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:42.813
WORKERS. THIS INDUSTRY HAS A

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.450
OF- SIGNIFICANT IF NOT MAJORITY

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:49.620
WOMEN WORKERS WE KNOW TO STUDY

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:52.456
AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY THAT

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:55.359
WOMEN WORKERS ESPECIALLY AS

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.628
THEY GET A LITTLE BIT OLDER ARE

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:59.964
THE MOST DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.200
WHEN IT COMES TO. THREE ARE

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.536
GETTING THEIR JOBS BACK- AND

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:07.338
THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN NATIONALLY

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:10.374
AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.376
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE WOMEN

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:15.146
IN THIS INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:16.247
GO BACK TO THE JOB THAT THEY

00:40:16.313 --> 00:40:19.283
HELD THAT IT NOTHING MORE

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.985
NOTHING LESS JUST GET THEIR

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.187
JOBS BACK SO THIS WAS FULLY

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.955
DEBATED LAST YEAR IT WENT ALL

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:26.957
THE WAY. TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:28.392
AND THE GOVERNOR RAISED SEVERAL

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:30.728
ISSUES OF CONCERN TO HIM IN THE

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:33.164
VETO MESSAGE ALL OF THOSE

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.499
ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:37.568
THIS BILL ALL OF THOSE ISSUES

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.771
FROM- THE LINK THERE IS A

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:43.073
SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.109
LAST YEAR THERE WAS NO. LAWS

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:48.946
SUNSET. SOME OF THE PRIVATE

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:51.015
RIGHT OF ACTION WELL THERE WERE

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:52.917
SEVERAL OTHER OF THE SCOPE THAT

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.885
IT HAD TO BE RELATED TO. A

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.787
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY LIKE

00:40:56.854 --> 00:40:59.190
COVERT NINETEEN. OF THEIR WORDS

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:03.327
NO- IT WAS NOT THAT NARAL LAST

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.462
YEAR IS VERY NARROW THIS YEAR.

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.731
AND REALLY GOES TO THE HEART OF

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:10.134
THE ISSUE IS. WORKING PEOPLE IN

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:12.703
THE VERY VERY CRITICAL INDUSTRY

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.739
TO CALIFORNIA. THOSE MEN AND

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:18.175
WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN- NO

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:20.611
FAULT OF THEIR OWN LOST THEIR

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.646
JOBS BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC.

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:25.282
ALL IT'S SAYING IS LET'S ALLOW

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:28.018
THEM TO GO BACK TO THEIR JOBS

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:28.619
LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THEY GET

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:31.455
BACK TO WORK. NOW THE TIMING IS

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.657
SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE

00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:35.559
OPENING UP OPENING UP WILL

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:38.929
FULLY OPEN UP IN A MATTER OF

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:41.098
MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AND

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.067
THOSE PEOPLE THOSE WORKERS

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:44.468
THOSE WORKING FAMILIES SHOULD

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:46.303
BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THEIR THEIR

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.273
JOBS SO THE URGENCY IS NOW TO

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.175
GET THEM ALLOW THEM TO GET BACK

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:53.878
TO WORK- AND I REALLY BELIEVE

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:57.915
THE- THE NARROW SCOPE. IS THAT

00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:59.783
THE KEY ELEMENT HERE AND THAT

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:02.119
WE FULLY DEBATED THIS LAST YEAR

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:05.522
SO I REALLY URGE. EVERYONE TOOK

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.558

THIS OF FOR THE TIMELINESS FOR

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:12.162
THE FOR THE FACT THAT WE FULLY

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.898
DEBATED THE FACT THAT IT'S

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:15.633
IMPACTING SO MANY WOMEN WHO

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:19.169
JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO WORK.

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:21.205

MEMBERS I WANTED TO SHARE- A

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:30.114
LITTLE BIT EXPERIENCE AS A

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.448
BUSINESS OWNER ON JUST

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.284
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.919
HAPPENED DURING COVERT SO

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:37.354
NUMBER ONE FIRST WE DID A STATE

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:39.223
HOME ORDER EVERYBODY WENT HOME.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.159
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALONG

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:42.693
WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.430
ALLOWED. THERE ARE POLICE TO

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:49.233
YEAH WE GET TO UNEMPLOYMENT ONE

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.501
OF THE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:51.568
UNEMPLOYMENT APARTMENT WE'VE

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:52.770
ALL DEALT WITH THAT NOT GONNA

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:54.805
GO THERE BUT IS THAT THEY

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.174
DIDN'T ASK THE EMPLOYERS. WHEN

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.410
THE EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF

00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:00.778
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS LAID OFF

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:02.313
FOR A SHORT PERIOD FOR SURE AND

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:03.180
IN THIS THEY WERE SENT TO

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.516
WORKERS- BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:06.750
THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GAVE

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:07.918
SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK AND

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.553
THEN. AND THEN THE MAXIMUM I

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.387
THINK FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:12.256
CALIFORNIA'S. MAYBE FOUR

00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:13.724
HUNDRED A LITTLE MORE. SO SOME

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:15.259
OF THESE EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:15.960
MAKING MORE MONEY BY NOT

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:18.195
WORKING. BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.731
INFUSION OF RESOURCES. TO CAUSE

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:22.833
A PROBLEM FOR THOSE BUSINESSES

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.434
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HIRE THE

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.336
BACKS OF MANY. BUSINESSES WHICH

00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:28.172
I KNOW PERSONALLY- FOR THEIR

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:29.373
EMPLOYEES WOULDN'T COME BACK TO

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.808
WORK BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:32.409
ABILITY FOR THE E. D. TO

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:33.744
ACTUALLY DIDN'T SAY STOP

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:37.982
QUANTIFYING. TO THE TO THE

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:40.084
EMPLOYERS IF THEY WERE. REALLY

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.385
UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE IF YOU OFFER

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.587
THEM BACK THEIR JOB. AND THEY

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:44.188
DON'T AND THEY DON'T RETURN TO

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:46.256
THEIR JOB. THEN YOU ARE NOT

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:47.925
REQUIRED TO PAID EMPLOYMENT BUT

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:48.459
THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:50.794
DIDN'T. FILL IN THAT LOOP SO A

00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:52.463
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:53.330
WERE WHY WOULD THEY GO BACK TO

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:54.565
WORK WHEN THEY'RE MAKING MORE

00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:55.833
MONEY BY NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF

00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:57.568
THE- RESOURCES THAT WERE PUT

00:43:57.634 --> 00:44:00.437
IN. TO NOW THIS BILL WE COME WE

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.339
FAST FORWARD TO THIS TIME.

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.440
WE'RE NOT GOING TO IT WE'RE

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:05.409
GOING TO PENALIZE SOME OF THOSE

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:08.779
EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:10.514
HIRE IN A DIFFERENT I WOULD

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.782
TELL YOU IF I OFFERED A JOB

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.317
BACK TO MY EMPLOYEE WHO DIDN'T

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:14.251
COME BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.219
MAKING MORE MONEY BECAUSE THE

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:16.020
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:17.654
STATE WAS PUT. PASSING OUT

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:19.923
MONEY AND WASN'T VERIFYING. THE

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.891
REASON FOR THEM TO LOSE THEIR

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:21.992
JOB. I WOULD NOT WANT TO HIRE

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:24.294
THEM FIRST BECAUSE THEY HAD AN

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:24.862
OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK TO

00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:26.997
WORK. AND THEY DIDN'T COME BACK

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:29.033
TO WORK SO MY POINT IS THAT

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:30.634
IT'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:33.137
BUT IS NOT DEALT WITH. IN THIS

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:34.905
SCENARIO ED BUT IT PENALIZES.

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:35.939
THE BUSINESS OWNERS AND MANY OF

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:37.541
THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:39.009
THAT ARE VERY STRUGGLING RIGHT

00:44:39.076 --> 00:44:41.445
NOW. TRANSMITIDO USES ISSUE

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:42.146
IT'S NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT BUT

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.947
IT'S A FACT. IN ITS IN ITS

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:46.083
REALLY DIFFICULT AS A BUSINESS

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.985
OWNER THEY HAVE THE LEGISLATURE

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.087
PUSH DOWN THESE RULES. WHEN

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.855
YOU'RE BASICALLY TELLING US HOW

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:52.389
TO RUN OUR BUSINESS WHEN

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.725
THERE'S- WE HAVE WE COULDN'T

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.460
GET THEM TO COME BACK TO WORK

AFFORD ANY PROTECTION THAT

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.316
WOULD BE LESS THAN WHAT IS

00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:53.196
FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.949
COMMON I WANTED TO ADD IS THAT-

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:17.621
HI. I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY THE

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.389
INTERESTING THING WAS WE'VE

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:23.360
NOTED MORRIS- DESCRIBED IS THAT

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:25.696
THIS IS A SECTOR THAT HAD VERY

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:28.198
HUGE JOB LOSS WHICH OF COURSE

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:29.266
IT WOULD HAVE BECAUSE IT

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:33.637
CLOSED- AND INTERESTINGLY IT IS

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:36.540
ALSO RIGHT NOW THE SECTOR THAT

00:49:36.606 --> 00:49:40.877
IS OPENING. MOST QUICKLY. AND

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.513
SO THERE THAT IS A THAT GIVES

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.749
US THAN A RATIONALE FOR WHY WE

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.118
WOULD WANT TO ACT NOW TO HELP

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:50.020
INSURE THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:52.723
AS ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUE STATED

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:53.323
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN LOSS OF

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.993
JOB. NOW HOWEVER. SOME OF THOSE

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.929
EMPLOYEES MAY CHOOSE NOT TO GO

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.897
BACK RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:03.333
THEIR CHOICE NOW FOR SOME OF

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.103
THEM IT MAY NOT BE IN EFFECT

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:09.973
WHAT I WANT TO CALL A. THERE'S

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:10.574
CHOICE AND THEIR CHOICE BUT I

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.578
THINK WE- YES IT ON UNDER

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.546
EMPLOYMENT WITH THE ADDITIONAL

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:17.581
BENEFITS THAT THE FEDERAL

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.516
GOVERNMENT PROVIDED SOME LOADS

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.852
LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE

00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:26.123
COMPENSATED DID HIGHER HOWEVER.

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:27.691
THE CHOICE TO GO BACK TO WORK

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:31.461
OR NOT LET'S TAKE FOR EXAMPLESOME OF THE WOMEN IN THE

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:34.765
SECTOR. IS ALSO. DEPENDING ON

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:35.799
WHETHER THEY HAVE CHILDREN AT

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.868
HOME. AND WHETHER THERE'S CHILD

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.536
CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND WE

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:41.438
KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC ALSO

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.340
CLOSED MOSTRO CARE FACILITIES

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.175
OR WHETHER SCHOOLS ARE OPEN.

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:46.743
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'RE

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:47.444
JUST BEGINNING TO GET OUR

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:49.846
SCHOOLS BACK OPEN. SO WE COULD

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:52.249
FACE A SITUATION WHERE SOME

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.917
WOMEN WHEN THEIR EMPLOYER

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:55.485
OFFERS IT BACK TO HIM OR NOT IN

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:56.653
A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.789
EXERCISE THE CHOICE. TO TAKE

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.690
THE JOB ACT WHICH I THINK WOULD

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:03.093
BE VERY UNFORTUNATE. BUT THERE

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.695
IS NOT ANY THEN. RESPONSIBILITY

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:07.764
ON EMPLOYERS IF THE PERSON IS

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.032
OFFERED THE JOB AND THEY CHOOSE

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.967
NOT TO THE EMPLOYER CAN PROCEED

00:51:11.034 --> 00:51:13.370
WITH HIRING SOMEONE ELSE. NOW I

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:16.606
WOULD HOPE THAT IN THAT WE CAN

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:17.908
THESE THINGS CAN ALL KIND OF A

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:20.043
LINE IN THE TRIAL CARE BEGINS

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:23.180
TO GET OPEN AGAIN ALSO. AND I

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:25.015
THINK WE'VE A- WE AND THE

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:26.249
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:27.584
ACTING TO PROVIDE SOME MORE

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:28.919
FUNDING. IN ORDER TO HELP

00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:30.587
ENSURE THAT CHILD CARE SAVING

00:51:30.654 --> 00:51:32.155
TO GET CHILD CARE BACK OPEN WE

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.390
KNOW THAT WE'VE ACTED TO HELP

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:35.625
OUR SCHOOLS GET BACK OPEN. SO

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.561
HOPEFULLY THESE THINGS A LINE.

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:39.696
SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE AND WOMEN

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.298
ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:43.233
HAVE AG CHILD. CARE

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.801
RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME BUT

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:46.803
CERTAIN PRIMARILY. HOPEFULLY

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.972
THESE THINGS A LINE SO THAT

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:50.907
WHEN PEOPLE ARE OFFERED THEIR

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.676
JOBS BACK THEY CAN TAKE THEM.

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.277
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT OF

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:56.279
COURSE IS THAT. THEY WOULD BE

00:51:56.346 --> 00:51:57.747
OFFERED THEIR JOBS BACK AND GET

00:51:57.814 --> 00:51:59.983
THE SAME TYPE OF WAGE. THAT

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.319
THEY RECEIVED. PRIOR WHEN THEY

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:04.754
LAID OFF. INTERESTINGLY DURING

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:07.457
THE GREAT RECESSION. OLDER

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.526
WORKERS NOW WE'RE TALKING AGES

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:11.161
FORTY FIVE AND ABOVE. WERE LAID

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:13.029
OFF AT A HIGHER RATE. LOWER

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:15.365
WAGE WORKERS NOT AS NOT

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:18.702
EXECUTIVE BUT LOWER WAGE WERE

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:19.302
LAID OFF AT A HIGHER RATE THAN

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:22.672
YOUNGER. AND ON AVERAGE PICKED

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:23.640
UP TO A YEAR TO GET ANOTHER

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:27.010
JOB. COMPARED TO WORKERS WHO

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.646
WERE FORTY AND YOUNGER WHO ON

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:31.448
THE AVERAGE TOOK NINETEEN TO

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:34.351
TWENTY WEEKS. THE ADDITIONAL

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.486
FACTOR IS THAT THOSE OLDER

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:37.821
WORKERS DURING THE RECESSION

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:40.824
WHO WERE LAID OFF. AND IT TOOK

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:41.658
ON AVERAGE A YEAR TO GET

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:44.594
ANOTHER JOB THERE SAID NEXT JOB

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:46.463
AFTER THAT LONG PERIOD OF

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.131
UNEMPLOYMENT WAS AT A FAR LOWER

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.866
WAGE THAN THEIR PREVIOUS JOB

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.334
NOT SO WITH THE YOUNGER

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:55.605
WORKERS. SO WHEN YOU IMAGINE I

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:57.474
THINK ANY OF US AS WE GET.

00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:00.076
CLOSER TOWARDS RETIREMENT. WE

00:53:00.143 --> 00:53:01.011
ARE HOPING THAT WE ARE NOT

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:03.079
GOING BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:05.815
OUR- INCOME OR CONTRIBUTIONS TO

00:53:05.882 --> 00:53:07.751
SOCIAL SECURITY SINCE THAT IS

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:08.785
WHAT'S GOING TO BE OUR

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:11.221
RETIREMENT SECURITY. SO I THINK

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.590
THIS WHEN WE LOOK AT. WHAT

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:14.124
HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.459
