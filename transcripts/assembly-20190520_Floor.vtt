IT.

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:16.077
UNLIKE SOME OF YOU -- I DON'T

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.878
SIT AROUND AND TALK ABOUT THE

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:19.914
BRUINS AND THE ESEE FOLKS AND

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.248
ALL THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M A

01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:22.950
I'M A HIGH I'M IN A HIGHER IT

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:24.118
EDUCATOR.

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.486
AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:26.921
INSTITUTIONS ARE EXCELLENT AND

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:28.656
ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:30.624
KIND OF EDUCATION EXPERIENCE FOR

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:31.859
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:32.960
I'M DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF YOU

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:34.695
BECAUSE I'M A TRIPLE BREWING.

01:35:34.762 --> 01:35:36.263
I HAVE A BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:37.731
AND A PHD FROM UCLA.

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:41.235
AND RECEIVE THEM.

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:44.505
RECEIVE THEM BOTH BY THE AGE OF

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:45.439
TWENTY SIX AND I SAY THAT

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:47.374
PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE I WAS SOME

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:49.176
PRODIGY CHILD.

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:50.978
BUT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA GAVE ME

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.746
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:55.816
AND THAT'S THE VALUE OF UCLA.

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.751
NOT THE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:58.319
AND ALL THOSE THINGS WE GET

01:35:58.385 --> 01:35:59.820
CAUGHT UP IN.

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.222
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS STATE

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.957
DECIDED TO DEVELOP THE

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.792
UNIVERSITY IS A CALIFORNIA. TO

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.694
BE A COUNTER TO THE PRIVATE

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.295
INSTITUTIONS THAT THE AVERAGE

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:10.197
CALIFORNIAN COULDN'T AFFORD.

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.565
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE S. SEASON WE

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:12.700
HAVE THE STAMFORD TO WE HAVE

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.435
THOSE PLACES BUT THEY WERE ALL

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:16.036
DESIGNED FOR THE ELITE.

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:17.805
AND SO CALIFORNIA DECIDED IN ITS

01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:20.541
WISDOM TO DEVELOP A UNIVERSITY

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:21.242
SYSTEM.

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:23.344
THAT WOULD BE COMPETITIVE WITH

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.112
THE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. TO

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:26.747
PROVIDE AN EDUCATION FOR THE

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.482
EVERY CHILD AND WHEN YOU READ

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:29.583
THE PREAMBLE OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.285
OF CALIFORNIA YOU SEE THAT THAT

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:32.953
THAT IT'S IT'S MISSION.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.288
AND I TAKE PRIDE IN THE FACT

01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:35.823
THAT BEING A POOR KID FROM SOUTH

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.558
CENTRAL LA.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:38.859
THAT I COULD GO TO ONE OF THE

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:41.495
FINEST INSTITUTIONS IN THE WORLD.

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:42.796
GET DEGREES FROM THAT

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.298
INSTITUTION THAT WOULD OPEN

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.633
DOORS FOR ME THAT I HAD NEVER

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:47.868
IMAGINED MYSELF.

01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:49.236
AND THAT IS WHAT THE UNIVERSITY

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.305
OF CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT.

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:53.140
THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE LA IS ABOUT

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:54.441
THAT IT REALLY GIVES EVERY

01:36:54.508 --> 01:36:56.310
CALIFORNIANS EVERY CHILD

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:58.012
OPPORTUNITY TO BE EXCELLENT.

01:36:58.078 --> 01:36:59.847
THAT IS TRULY THE AMERICAN

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:00.681
EQUALIZER.

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.049
AND CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD BE PROUD

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:03.050
OF THAT.

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:04.685
AND THE FACT THAT ONE OF ITS

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.220
INSTITUTIONS UCLA ALONG

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:07.888
OBVIOUSLY WOULD BERKELEY AS WELL

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:10.024
AS REALLY DISTINGUISH ITSELF NOT

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.692
JUST IN CALIFORNIA.

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.160
BUT AROUND THE WORLD WE SHOULD

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:14.695
BE VERY PROUD.

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:15.996
AND WE SHOULD BE VERY COMMITTED

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:18.232
TO MAINTAINING OUR INSTITUTIONS

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:19.934
FOR OUR CHILDREN FOR THE EVERY

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.335
CHILD IN CALIFORNIA.

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:23.170
I TAKE PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT I

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:23.804
HAVE THREE DEGREES WHEN YOU SEE

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.005
A WAY.

01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:27.541
AND I GRADUATED OWING A DEBT OF

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.443
TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS.

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.312
THAT'S UCLA.

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:33.180
THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA DREAM THAT

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:35.282
IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:36.717
FOR SO THAT WE DON'T END UP IN

01:37:36.784 --> 01:37:38.319
IN DEBT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

01:37:38.385 --> 01:37:40.387
BUILD A LIFE AND IT GIVES US THE

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:42.056
OPPORTUNITY THEN TO WORK. TO

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:43.657
CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:45.993
WITHOUT THE TREMENDOUS DEBT THAT

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.795
WE SEE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING TODAY.

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:49.730
MOST OF US PROBABLY SAW THE WHAT

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:51.065
HAPPENED AND MORE HOUSES WEEKEND.

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.166
WHEN ONE OF OUR BLACK

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:54.401
BILLIONAIRES DECIDED TO CANCEL

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.136
THE DEBT OF EVERY STUDENT WHO IS

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:57.838
A GRADUATE OF MOREHOUSE OVER

01:37:57.905 --> 01:37:58.772
FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS?

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:01.308
