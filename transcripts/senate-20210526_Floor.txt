SENATE BILL THREE FIFTEEN BY SENATOR ROTH AN ACT RELATING TO REVOKE HERBAL TRANSFER ON DEATH DEEDS SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES FOR MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNERS. REAL PROPERTY IS THE ONLY ASSET THAT THE HOMEOWNER CAN PASS ON TO. THEIR ERRORS. IN CALIFORNIA ONE WAY TO CONVEY PROPERTY OWNERS THROUGH A WILL OR TRUST BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE COST PROHIBITIVE PROBATE. FOR STATE PLANNING ATTORNEY CONSULTATION. ONE OF THE OTHER WAYS PARTICULAR TO THOSE WITHOUT RESOURCES IS THE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED. REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED PROVIDES A MUCH MORE% ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE MECHANISM OTHER THAN PROBATE. ANOTHER TOOL FOR THOSE FOR WHOM IT WORKS OFTEN THOSE WITH UNCOMPLICATED HOLDINGS AND SIMPLY A HOME. THE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED WAS CREATED BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AB ONE THIRTY NINE TO ALLOW OWNERS OF REAL PROPERTY TO TRANSFER THEIR PROPERTY UPON DEATH OUTSIDE OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM HAS A SUN STATE THAT HUNT SUNSET DATE CURRENTLY OF JANUARY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AND THIS BILL EXTENDS THAT DATE SPECIFICALLY SENATE BILL THREE FIFTEEN IS BASED OFF OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A REPORT. COMPLETED BY THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION AND IF ADOPTED WILL EXTEND THE SUNSET DATE UNTIL JANUARY ONE TWENTY THIRTY TO ALLOW THE USE OF A REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED TO TRANSFER REAL PROPERTY TO A PUBLIC ENTITY PRIVATE NONPROFIT ENTITY OR TRUST. STRENGTHEN TRANSFER AND BENEFICIARY PROTECTIONS SUCH AS REQUIRING THE DB SIGNED BY TWO WITNESSES REQUIRING THE BENEFICIARY GIVE NOTICE TO THE TRANSFERS THERE IS WHEN THE TRANSFER DYES. THAT ALLOW COURTS THE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE TRANSFERS INTENT IF AN ISSUE ARISES SIMILAR TO THE WAY THOSE ISSUES ARE DEALT WITH WITH WILLS AND TRUSTS. CONTINUING RESTRUCTURE THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE BENEFICIARIES LIABILITY FOR A DECEASED TRANSFERS AND SECURE DEBTS. GIVE THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION ADDITIONAL TIME TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF THESE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEEDS EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE NEW REFORMS AND MAKE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS.

SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SIX BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI AND ACTUALLY INTO BUSINESS CENTER WHY BECAUSE THE FLOOR IS YOURS MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS SPF THREE FOUR SIX WILL PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY BY REQUIRING THAT CONSUMERS BE INFORMED AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE IF THE CAMERA IS INSTALLED INSIDE OF A CAR. MOREOVER IT WILL PROHIBIT VIDEO RECORDINGS MADE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR BY THEN AND IN VEHICLE CAMERA FROM BEING USED FOR ADVERTISING OR SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE CAMERAS AROUND OUTSIDE THE CARS WITH THESE FOR THE CAMERAS THAT ARE. TO MY SURPRISE ARE INSTALLED ON THE INSIDE THE CAR HE WAS PRESENT WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME INSIDE OUR CARS AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WHEN WE'RE DRIVING WHETHER WE'RE COMMUTING TO WORK RUNNING ERRANDS AND PICKING UP OUR KIDS- REVEALS A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. AND IT'S FOR THIS REASON THAT THERE'S MANY FIRMS- TAKE COMFORT THIS CAR RELATED DATA I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY THESE DATA COULD BE WORTH UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO DIFFERENT FOLKS THEY USE IS IN CAPS IN VEHICLE. CAMERAS TO MONITOR OUR KEYS TO GAUGE OUR ATTENTIVENESS AND RECORD SENSITIVE INFORMATION WHAT WE COMMUTE TO WORK OR PICK UP OUR CHILDREN WHICH ALLOWS THESE ARE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO BUILD DETAILED COMPOSITES ARE HABITS AND LIKES- THEY CAN BE USED TO TARGET US FOR ADVERTISING WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT OUR GAZE WOULD BE WORTH SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. SO THIS IS A FAST DEVELOPING PROBLEM WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S ONLY A FEW CARS AND ALL THAT HAVE THESE INC IN VEHICLE CAMERAS BUT IT'S COMING. TO AN END IT'S ONLY GOING TO INCREASE THE INVASIVENESS AS TECHNOLOGY PROGRESSES SO BY PROHIBITING THE VIDEOS RECORDINGS FOR MADE INSIDE THE CAMERA INSIDE THE VEHICLE FROM BEING USED FOR ADVERTISING FOR BEING SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES THIS BILL SB.

SENATE BILL TWO BY SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE SENT ABROAD FOR. THANK YOU. NOW PRESIDENT I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A CRITICAL I DON'T. CRITICAL I DON'T NOT ONLY TO CALIFORNIA BUT TO AMERICA. I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE KIND OF ROSS JUNIOR POLICE TO CERTIFICATION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS BILLS AUTHORED JOINT AUTHORED BY MYSELF. AND OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM. MISS ATKINS. AND IT'S A PRIORITY NOT ONLY TO THE BLACK CAUCUS BUT THE CALIFORNIA AND AMERICA AS WELL. SENATORS YESTERDAY MARKED THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE BRUTALIZING YOU KILLING IN A PUBLIC EXECUTION OF GEORGE FLOYD. AND IT'S BEEN. IT'S A YEAR SINCE WE WITNESS THE NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY NINE CENTS A SECOND A SYSTEMATIC RACISM AND POLICE BRUTALITY IN FULL DISPLAY. A FEW DAYS LATER MANY OF US IN THIS CHAMBER STOOD TOGETHER OUTSIDE THIS CAPITOL IN HONOR OF FLOYD'S A LIVE INVOLVED NOT TO BE COMPLICIT. TO BE BOLD TO BE BRAVE AND PUSH FOR MEANINGFUL. POLICE REFORM. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. WHAT IS CHANGED OVER THE LAST YEAR. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS RECOGNIZE A BLACK AMERICANS HAVE KNOWN FOR CENTURIES THAT THEIR TWO TYPES OF POLICING IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT RACISM AND SYSTEMATIC IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT RACISM IN POLICING HOW CAN BE FATAL AND IS FATAL. IF YOU'RE A PERSON OF COLOR. MASSIVE PROTESTS RESHAPE OUR CITIES IT MADE US TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT HOW WE BOND AND OVERSEE OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. AND WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE PASSED SEVERAL WELL MEANING AN EFFECTIVE POLICE REFORM BILLS. HOWEVER THERE'S STILL MUCH TO BE DONE. SINCE THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD. ALMOST A THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED. AND THE REAL TRAGEDY IS THAT MOST OF THEM ARE BLACK AND BROWN. THEY HAVE BEEN SHOT. LEARNING FROM THE POLICE. ONE IN TEN. HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS I STATED THE MAJORITY OF BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS NOT ME LAW ENFORCEMENT IS BAD AT THEIR JOB. OR NOT. SUFFICIENTLY JOURNEY. ONE PORTRAIT SHOWS PLENTY OF RESTRAINT WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH. ARMED WHITE MEN IT'S NOT ABOUT TRAINING BECAUSE THEY GETIT RIGHT 95% OF THE TIME WHEN THE ENCOUNTER NOT ONLY WHITE MEN WHITE MEN WITH GUNS INDIVIDUALS LIKE JEFF BRICKER NECKLACE NECKLACE. KILL TWO DEPUTIES IN TEXAS THIS MONTH. PETER MANAFORT- FOR THE INTERNAL SEARCH FOR MISSING OF MAY KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS IN MARYLAND BREAKING TRAVIS MET MICHAEL WHO KILLED AHMAD HARBORING SIMPLY BY DRUNK DRIVING ROBERT LONG WHO COMMITTED A VIOLENT SHOOTING SPREE ASIAN WOMEN THIS YEAR IN ATLANTA. RITTENHOUSE THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO SHOT THREE PEOPLE AND KILLED ONE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH ASSAULT WEAPONS. AN OFFICER SIMPLY WAVED AT HIM. CAN. KNOW WHAT ALL THESE FOLKS OUT IN COMMON THERE WERE WHITE MEN. AND THEY WILL HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT VALUES THE LIVES OF WHITE MEN WHO ARE ARMED MORE SO THAN BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE FLEEING FROM POLICE RUNNING FROM POLICE BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE POLICE I DON'T HATE THE POLICE. THE POLICE. BUT LIKE I SAY BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE ARE NOT AFFORDED TO SEE PATIENTS NOR THE SAME RESTRAINT OR THE SAME RESPECT AND REVERENCE FOR LIFE. ROSS JUNIOR. I'LL JUST GUARDADO'S DIJON KIZI STEP ON CLARK JOHN MONTERROSA. NO RESEAL BEIRNE MARIO GONZALEZ OR NOTICE APRIL MORE T. JOHNSON CORNELL NICOLAS PIMENTEL. AND RIGHT NOW FOSTER ARE JUST SOME OF THE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY POLICE IN THE LAST SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AS THEIR PARENTS AFTER LOVE ONCE. THEY FILL. NONE OF WHOM WERE ARMED. AND WHILE SOME OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED HAVE BEEN CHARGED NONE OF BEING CONVICTED OF MURDER. THIS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CHARGED. WITH MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER. I SAID TO SAY ONLY SEVEN WERE CONVICTED. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THOSE PERCENTAGE THOSE ODDS OF GETTING THINGS RIGHT ALL THE TIME. WHATEVER THE GEORGE FLOYD WAS NOT RARE. WHAT IS RARE WAS THAT THE MURDER MURDER ALSO TRAWLING WITHOUT ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S A RARITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR IN AMERICA WHEN IT COMES TO. CHARGING AND PROSECUTING POLICE OFFICERS. PLEASE ACCOUNTABILITY. IS THE MOST SERIOUS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS OFFENSE. AND IF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS BILL THIS IS NOT ANTI POLICE MEASURE BY NO STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. THIS MEASURE DOES TWO THINGS. FIRST IT CREATES A STATEWIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF AN OFFICER AFTER THE CONVICTION OF SERIOUS CRIMES OR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE TO MISCONDUCT. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT OFFICERS CAN COMMIT MISCONDUCT IN ONE DEPARTMENT AND SIMPLY MOVE TO ANOTHER. THIS BILL IS NAMED AFTER KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR. A YOUNG MAN WHO GREW UP RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM ME. IN THE CITY OF GARDENA. THE OFFICER WHO SHOT JENNIFER OFF JUNIOR. SOON AS I HEARD IT I SAID THAT'S NOT A GARDENA POLICE OFFICER THAT'S NOT TO CHARACTER GARDENA POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE I'VE LIVED IN THAT CITY FOR FIFTY TWO YEARS I'M ON PERSONAL FIRST NAME BASIS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THOSE OFFICE YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. THE LAST THREE POLICE CHIEFS I PERSONALLY KNOW AND I JOKE WITH MY NOON BEFORE THEY HAD STRIPES LET ALONE BARS AND STARS IN THEIR TOWN AND SOON AS I HEARD I SAID THAT'S NOT THE CHARACTER OF A GUARDIAN A POLICE OFFICER ONLY TO FIND OUT THE PERSON WHO SHOT MR OFF TRANSFERRED FROM ORANGE COUNTY. AFTER BEING INVOLVED IN THREE QUESTIONABLE SHOOTINGS THERE. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT OFFICES CAN COMMIT MISCONDUCT IN. DEPARTMENT AND SIMPLY MOVE MOVE TO ANOTHER ONE. WITHOUT ANY REPERCUSSIONS. THIS IS UNFAIR TO COMMUNITY SPONSORED TO VICTIMS OF POLICE ABUSE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY UNFAIR TO THE MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS. WHO DO THEIR JOB EVERY DAY. BUY THE BOOK. WHO PUT ON THAT UNIFORM PIN ON THAT BADGE AND DO IT IN ON A BULL IN A RESPECTFUL. WAY AS I STATED. THE MAJORITY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE. FIRST NAME BASIS WE COACHED TOGETHER WE PLAY TOGETHER. WE LAUGH TOGETHER AND WE CRIED TOGETHER. CHARLIE CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION. THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY CERTIFICATION PROCESS. FOR GETTING READY GETTING RID OF BAD OFFICERS. CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION AND LICENSE THE BAD DOCTORS. LAWYERS EVEN BAD BARBERS IN COST WITH ALL OF THIS IT'S EASIER TO LOSE A LICENSE FOR GIVING A BAD PERM AND IT IS FOR KILLING UNARMED MAN. BUT WE'RE UNABLE TO BE CERTIFIED POLICE OFFICERS WE HAVE BROKEN THE LAW VIOLATED PUBLIC TRUST. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE IN CALIFORNIA A STATE THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING THE FIRST PERSON TECHNOLOGY PERSON ENVIRONMENT PERSON A CHRONIC BLASTING POLICE REFORM. EXACTLY THIS BILL MAKES SEVERAL CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN THE TOM BAIN CIVIL RIGHTS ACT INSURANCE THE PEACE OFFICERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN COURT FOR VIOLATING A PERSON'S CIVIL RIGHTS. FOLLOWING SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO MAKE SOME MAJOR CHANGES TO THE SECTION AND WE MADE COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS. THOSE CONCERNS THAT MEMBERS RATES AND I APPRECIATE THOSE MEMBERS WHO LISTENED WITH OPEN MINDS. IT HELPED US REACH THOSE RESOLUTIONS. THIS WEEK WE MAKE THOSE MAJOR AMENDMENTS- REMOVE SECTIONS LAUREN THE STANDARD OF INTENT. FOR BANE ACT CLAIMS AND LIMITED WRONG THROUGH DEATH CLAIMS TO EGREGIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A MAJOR COMPROMISE WERE ESTIMATE. BUT WE CAN'T LET AS I SAY OFTEN STAYED PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. MEMBERS. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD BILL. THIS BILL WILL STILL ALLOW THE ALONG FOR ABUSE. AND THEIR FAMILIES TO SEEK JUSTICE REMOVE THE MOST EGREGIOUS IMMUNITIES THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CURRENTLY UTILIZES THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THE FUNDING POLICE OR ABOLISHING POLICE. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU. THE WHITE INDIVIDUALS WERE BEING KILLED. AT THIS RATE NOT ONLY WOULD YOU BE ARGUED ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION BUT YOU BE ARGUED ABOUT THE FUNDING THEM AND TAKING THEIR WEAPONS AWAY. IT'S NOT ABOUT ANTI POLICE IN AT ALL RATHER IT'S ABOUT ANTI BAD POLICE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT REMOVING THE BATH OFFICER IN OUR STATE AND WE ALL KNOW THEY EXIST. ARE COMMITTING SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND BREAKING THE TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS ISN'T A PERFECT BILL BY NO STRETCH OF IMAGINATION. BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT OUR COMMUNITY CAN TRUST AND IS WORTHY OF MOVING FORWARD. IT IS STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS ME I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK. I ABSOLUTELY REMAKE A MEDIC. TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. BUT WE CAN NOT WAIT ON THIS ISSUE MEMBERS HOW MANY MORE LIVES DO WE NEED TO LOSE WE CANNOT ALLOW ANOTHER YEAR TO PASS A LAW TO COMMITTING MISCONDUCT AND NOT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. CALIFORNIA'S DESERT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY CAN TRUST AND WILL TREAT THEM FAIRLY AND BE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY ABUSE THAT TRUST WE CANNOT SHY AWAY FROM THIS MOMENT WE MUST PASS IS MEANINGFUL REFORM I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD MEMBERS WILL MOVE TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE START WITH SENATOR ATKINS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH. COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TWO AS A JOINT AUTHOR WITH THE SENATOR FROM GARDENA. NINE TWO NINE. THOSE THREE NUMBERS HAVE TAKEN ON THEIR OWN HISTORIC AND INFAMOUS MEETING THEY REPRESENT THE LENGTH OF TIME AS WE ALL HAVE COME TO KNOW THAT AN OFFICER KNELT ON THE NECK OF GEORGE FLOORED. MURDERING HIM ONE YEAR AGO YESTERDAY. AFTER GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER MANY OF US JOINED ON THE STEPS OF THIS BUILDING TO PUBLICLY COMMIT TO FIGHTING FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND TO ENSURING. THAT THE LAWS WE CREATE HEARING CALIFORNIA REFLECT THAT COMMITMENT. SOME OF THE SMELL TO COMMEMORATE THE TIME IT TOOK TO KILL GEORGE FLOYD. SOME OF US PRAYED SOME OF A SHARED PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. SOME OF US JUST LISTENED INTENTLY ON INCREASING OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. ALL OF US WALKED AWAY FROM THAT MOMENT READY TO WORK. AND WE SPENT THE LAST YEAR WORKING CLOSELY WITH SENATOR BRADFORD AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THIS IMPORTANT BILL CROSSES THE FINISH LINE THIS YEAR. IT'S TAKING COUNTLESS HOURS TO GET S. B. TWO TO WHERE IT IS TODAY AND AS THE AUTHOR ALSO SAID THEY'RE STILL A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO BE DONE. WHAT A DEEPLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IT'S ALSO ONE OF GREAT COMPLEXITY WITH MANY MOVING PARTS. ONE THAT EVEN OUR NATIONAL COUNTERPARTS IN CONGRESS ARE GRAPPLING WITH IS THEY WORK TO DELIVER MUCH NEEDED REFORMS TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE DELIVERING ON THE PROMISES WE MADE TO EACH OTHER AND TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL ONE YEAR AGO. I LIKE YOU. BELIEVE IN THOSE PROMISES AND IN THE GREATER PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES ARE MAJORITY LEADER FOR HIS SUPPORT AND WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AND ABOVE ALL I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA FOR HIS TIRELESS DEDICATION ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION INTO THIS VITAL ISSUE. AS WE DID WITH AB THREE NINETY TWO THE SENATE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND IN FACT ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO HELP THIS BILL WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THIS YEAR SENATORS ARE VERY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINSON- HERTZBERG. THE REST OF. MY CAREER MY PHONE IS ON YEAH YOU GOT IT YEAH THANK YOU. THE MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY. HE'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS WE WILL CONSIDER THIS YEAR. WITHOUT QUESTION GLOBAL PANDEMIC DROUGHT RAGING WILDFIRES HORRIBLE ECONOMIC IMPACT TO BUSINESSES AND WORKERS THAT HAVE SO DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED THE STATE. FOLLOWED BY AN UNEXPECTED SURPLUS. HAVE INFORMED OUR WORK IN UNIMAGINABLE WAYS. BUT IT IS THIS MEASURE IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT IMPACTS THE SOUL OF WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER IT HAS A DEEPER MEANING. AS THE SENATOR FROM GARDENA THE PRO TEM MENTIONED IN THEIR REMARKS YESTERDAY MARKED ONE YEAR SINCE THE MURDER. GEORGE FLOYD ONE YEARS SINCE THE HORRIFIC AN UNBELIEVABLE ACTED THIS COUNTRY IN EXTRAORDINARY MANNER THAT AFFECTED ALL PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY NOT JUST THE COASTAL'S NOT JUST THE BLUE STATES WE THOUGHT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF SHEDDING LIGHT. LIGHT THAT NOT EVERYBODY SAW BUT LIKE THAT WAS NEEDED TO BE SHED ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. POLICE REFORM IS NECESSARY FOR THIS COUNTRY AND SO MANY IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AGREE AND HAVE AGREED WITH THAT. WE'RE AT A FLEXION POINT. WHERE THE URGENCY OF THE ISSUE CAN NO LONGER GO UNADDRESSED AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED. WHERE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS DEPEND UPON OUR SWIFT. AND DECISIVE ACTION TOWARD THAT END CENTER FROM WHERE DATA AND ARE PRO TEM JOINT AUTHOR PUT FORTH THIS MEASURE THAT DEALS WITH AS I SEE IT THREE ISSUES FIRST. PUTTING GUARDRAILS AROUND GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITIES THAT ARE TOO OFTEN USED TO SHED BAD ACTORS FROM LIABILITY SECOND. CREATES A PROCESS FOR DECERTIFYING OFFICERS AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED TO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW LIMITS DEMONSTRATED THAT UNFIT FOR SERVICE NOT ONLY IN THEIR OWN CURRENT DEPARTMENTS BUT ANYONE KNOWN FORSMAN AGENCY. FROM DISCUSSIONS MANY DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH MEMBERS THIS IS AN AREA IS BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE PRO TEM MENTION STILL NEEDS WORK. AND CERTAINLY YOU HEARD THE AUTHOR A COMMIT TO THAT AS HE DID WITH RESPECT TO THE HUNDREDS OF HOURS HE PUT INTO THIS MAJOR HERE THAT'S BEFORE US ON THIS FLOOR TODAY. THIRD AND FINALLY. WHICH IS REALLY THE CORE OF THE SUBJECT OF THE DISCUSSION- JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. ON THE CHANGES BEING BEING MADE TO THE BANE ACT NAMED AFTER MY DEAR FRIEND TOM BAIN WHO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT I CURRENTLY SERVE. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE BAND ACT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR HATE CRIMES. IT'S BEEN EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS AND THE AUTHOR. AMENDS THIS IS A RESULT OF- THE DISCUSSONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO REALLY FOCUS ON WHERE OFFICERS ARE REALLY BAD ACTORS WHERE THERE'S BARELY BEEN A STANDARD WHERE THEY'VE BEEN PROVEN TO BE BAD ACTORS AND NOT TO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT. ON GOOD POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT TO HAVE A HORRIBLE IMPACT ON THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT COULD BE IMPACTED THEIR TREASURIES TO BE IMPACTED THAT REGARDS. BY SETTING A STANDARD THAT ONLY ISN'T OVER BROAD AND THAT ONLY DEALS WITH THOSE THAT REALLY DESERVE TO BE SUBJECT TO. CIVIL RIGHTS ACT VIOLATIONS OF COURSE THIS EXTENDS IN WRONGFUL DEATH CASES EXTENDS THESE ACTIONS TO STATE COURTS WAS DRAMATICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE LEGAL BAR. AND ALSO OF COURSE GIVES PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES WHICH ARE TREMENDOUS INCENTIVES BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT OFFICERS ENGAGE IN APPROPRIATE CONDUCT. YOU KNOW WHAT. THE ON AS WITH ANY MONUMENTAL POLICY EFFORT THE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THIS MEASURE SB TWO WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE ATTENTION AS I SUGGESTED AND THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT THE WORK BUT THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU TODAY GOES EVEN FARTHER THAN THE FEDERAL AND ITS FEDERAL ANALOGUE OF THE GEORGE FLOYD JUSTICE AND POLICING ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH RESTRICTS CERTAIN POLICING PRACTICES AND ENHANCES TRANSPARENCY AND DATA COLLECTION BUT DOES NOT GO AS FAR AS TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AS THIS MEASURE DOES AND DOES NOT GOES TO FAR AS TO PROVIDE LEGAL REMEDIES FOR PLAINTIFFS WHICH WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY AND IS THE AUTHOR TALKED ABOUT CALIFORNIA BEING THE FIRST IN THE BEST THIS WILL MAKE IT. PUT US IN THAT POSITION. THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD STATED AS I SUGGESTED. MEANINGFUL ACTIONS CANNOT BE DEFERRED. THE THREAT TO JUSTICE CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED. TODAY IS THE DAY THAT WE ALL MUST ACT AS AGENTS OF PROGRESS. AND ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE TODAY THE SENATE MUST PASS THIS MEASURE I URGE YOUR I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SP TWO- AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM GARDENA- FOR HIS TENACITY- IN MOVING THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU TO THE PROTONS- FOR HELPING IN THAT EFFORT. THIS REALLY IS ABOUT- PUBLIC TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH RESPECT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- POLICING ONLY WORKS IF THE PUBLIC HAS CONFIDENCE. THAT POLICE OFFICERS ARE QUALIFIED- AND THAT'S IT AND IF THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE POLICING ON OUR- DON'T HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF ABUSING PEOPLE IT SEEMS SO BASIC RIGHT WE EXPECTED OF EVERY OTHER PROFESSION THAT IF YOU GO AND HIRE A LAWYER. OR YOU GO TO SEE A DOCTOR- OR AS THE AUTHORS STATED YOU GO TO GET A HAIR CUT THAT THAT PERSON IS IN GOOD STANDING AND HAS NOT ENGAGED AND AGREED JUST BEHAVIOR THAT WOULD MAKE YOU NOT WANT TO GO TO THAT PERSON. I KNOW CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW STATES IN THIS COUNTRY IT'S ACTUALLY EMBARRASSING THAT WE HAVE CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN STATES THAT HAVE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS SEES FOR POLICE OFFICERS WHO SHOULD NOT BE POLICE OFFICERS. I KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T. AN OFFICE CAN REACH IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INVESTIGATION AND GO GET HIRED SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAT IS EXACTLY HOW YOU UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN POLICING. THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING SO THIS IS LONG OVERDUE. AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FORWARD LOOKING REFORMS. TO IMPROVE POLICING. AND TO INCREASE COMMUNITY TRUST IN POLICING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT I TALKED ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE I AM. ONE OF THE MEMBERS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE- THERE ARE A FEW OF US WHO ACTUALLY LITIGATED- HAS LITIGATED THE BAN ACT. AND AS I SAID IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THE BAN ACT- I THINK I USE THE PHRASE IS A HOT MESS AND THANK YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR. A OTHER COLLEAGUES OF DR THAT PHRASE BECAUSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THIS IS A MASS OF A STATUTE- IT DOESN'T SERVE ANYONE WELL- AND SO THE CHANGES. THAT ARE WITH THAT WE HOPEFULLY WILL BE PASSING TODAY WELL NOT PERFECT. WE'LL BE AN IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF IN HELPING PEOPLE- RECOVER DAMAGES WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN. TERRIBLY WRONG SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN I HEARD TONIGHT THOUGH. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I TOO WANT TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TWO AND I WANT TO THANK AS WELL MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ALONG WITH MANY OF THE ADVOCATES THAT HE'S- A BUILT THE COALITION WITH- SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY DECERTIFICATION IS WHERE WE NEED TO STOP IN AND START AND END- WE NEED TO DO MORE. ESPECIALLY ON THE IMMUNITY PIECE- THE GEORGE FLOYD JUSTICE AND POLICING ACT BEING NEGOTIATED AS WE SPEAK AS WE KNOW MAY NOT EVEN INCLUDE A MUCH OF THOSE PROTECTIONS AS BEEN MENTIONED BY OUR MAJORITY LEADER. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PROTEST IN THE STREETS IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO ADVOCATES IT'S ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SAY YES WE DO SUPPORT THIS AND WE WANT TO SEE THIS STRONG- FORWARD THINKING. ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT ON OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDIAN- FOR HIS DEDICATION AND RESILIENCE ON THIS POLICY DATING BACK TO LAST YEAR BEFORE MY TIME IN THE SENATE. OF COURSE IT HAS BEEN STATED ELOQUENTLY BY MY COLLEAGUES THE HISTORY OF VIOLENCE THAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS EXPERIENCE INCLUDING AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ATROCIOUS AND UNFORGETTABLE AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE MUST UNEQUIVOCALLY RECOGNIZE BLACK LIVES MATTER. AND AS LEGISLATORS WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO DO THAT. AND THE CORRECT. OR BEGIN CORRECTING OUR COUNTRY'S LEGACY OF RACISM. HOLDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR SENSELESS VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR IS SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY TO PROGRESS. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I. FULLY SUPPORT THE CERTIFICATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR POLICING. AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE SPELLING OF EXPRESS THEM WITH THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA- THE PROCESS OF THIS BILL TO ME IT SEEMS PROBLEMATIC. THE BOARD TICKETS CREATED THESE PEACE OFFICERS STANDARDS ACCOUNTABILITY ADVISORY BOARD IS ONE THAT SHALL WE HAVE THE POWER TO INITIATE ANY INVESTIGATIONS INTO PEACE OFFICERS. IT SHALL HAVE THE% POWER TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CERTIFICATION AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS SHALL BE ACCEPTED UNLESS THERE WITHOUT A REASONABLE BASIS. ALL THAT I THINK IS WELL AND GOOD BUT THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD IS ONE WHERE YOU STILL HAVE TWO OF THE NINE MEMBERS. BE THOSE WHO SHALL NOT BE FOR PEACE OFFICERS WITH SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE WORKING AT NON PROFITS ARE ACADEMICS RELATED TO ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ON ISSUES RELATED POLICE MISCONDUCT. TO MEMBERSHIP IN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NOT FORMER POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE WORKING IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ON ISSUES RELATED TO POLICE MISCONDUCT. TWO MEMBERS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NOT P. FORMER PEACE OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO WRONGFUL USE OF FORCE LIKELY TO CAUSE DEATH. OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY BY PEACE OFFICER FOR SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS OF A PERSON KILLED BY THE WRONGFUL FORCE USE OF FORCE BY PEACE OFFICER. AND ONE SHOULD BE AN ATTORNEY. NOT A FORMER PEACE OFFICER WITH SUBSTANTIAL PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE INVOLVING OVERSIGHT OF PEACE OFFICERS. AT SEVEN OF THE NINE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD SHALL BE PEOPLE. THAT AT LEAST ON FACE VALUE. LOOK TO BE PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF A PREDISPOSITION TO. PERHAPS BEING OPPOSED TO PLEASE. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE ATTORNEYS IN THIS ROOM. IF YOU SAW A JURY MADE UP WITH THREE QUARTERS OF THE MEMBERS HAVING SOME KIND OF EXPERIENCE. IN THEIR LIVES OR SOME KIND OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE. THAT MADE THEM PREDISPOSED AGAINST THAT- I THINK YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND THAT THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM AT A JURY- AND SO I DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE PROCESS. THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S DOING WHAT'S RIGHT AND PRETTY FAIR PROCESS AND I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO BE CLEAR I BELIEVE BLACK LIVES MATTER. BUT I THINK AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN THE STATE TO ADDRESS. THE NEEDS OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE TO CREATE AN IDEAL FAIR AND IMPARTIAL PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH THAT POLICE OFFICERS. AND I THINK THAT THIS PROCESS RIGHT NOW IS WHAT NO I I'VE STAYED UP ALL NIGHT I WAS HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE I DO THINK IT IS FLAWED AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROCESS ADDRESS. AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW THAT THIS BILL. HE'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL PARTICULARLY. GIVEN THAT IT COMES ONE DAY AFTER THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE GEORGE FLOOD KILLING. IT IS SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT IT IS A. AS AS MIGHT CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES STATED IT IS. IMPORTANT THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA LIED ON POLICE REFORM. YEAH AND- YOU KNOW IT IS I THINK. IT JUST SUCH AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR US TO TRY TO PASS TODAY. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT. THIS BILL WHICH IS ALREADY AND I WOULD COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA FOR TAKING A MAN THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN ACT ALREADY. I'M TOLD THIS BILL WILL HAVE FURTHER AMENDMENTS POTENTIALLY COMING AS IT GOES THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY- I WILL BE VOTING I TODAY BUT I JUST WANTED TO GLOSS MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. AND TO KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES BACK ON CONCURRENCE I MET RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE MY BOAT. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER MAIN BASE IN GERMANY WE HAVE THREE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THE QUEUE TO SPEAK WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO CENTER LABOR. AND WE'RE GOING TO CENTRE TORONTO IN SENIOR SKINNER CERTAINLY FOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MR PRESIDENT. MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SP TWO. I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR APART FROM GARDENA FOR HIS STEADFAST WORK ON THIS-BILL. AS HE SAID THE BILL IS NOT PERFECT. BUT THE ISSUE WAS PERFECT AND THE ISSUE IS RIGHTEOUS. I APPRECIATE THAT IF THIS BILL GETS OFF THE FLOOR. MORE WORK WILL BE DONE AND SHOULD BE DONE. I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE CAN GET TO AN AGREEMENT THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO EVERYONE. AS A SOCIETY MEMBERS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER AS TIME GOES BY. AND I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER ISSUE FOR US TO GET BETTER ON THEM POLICE REFORM MEMBERS I STAND STRONG SUPPORT. AND I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL AS WELL. THANK YOU SENTOR LEYVA BASE ENGINE IN THE SENATE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO SENATOR ALSO THE NEW SENATOR SKINNER THINNER ALLEN CENTER- BURKE AND SENATOR STERN. CENTER DRAWS A GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I TOO WANT TO ADD MY VOICE AND I THANK THE AUTHOR. I THANK OUR PRO TEM I THANK OUR MAJORITY LEADER. FOR THEIR WORDS. ADD MY VOICE BECAUSE- ALTHOUGH POLICE BRUTALITY. AND VIOLENCE ON AFRICAN AMERICANS IS HISTORIC AND DEEP. FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY. I WOULD SAY THAT IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST. THE NUMBER NUMBER OF LATINOS KILLED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE IS ALSO SUBSTANTIAL AND SIGNIFICANT AND WRONG. I TOO HAD TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION WITH MY SON AND HIS OLDER BROTHER. ABOUT ABOUT WHAT TO FEAR AND HOW TO ACT IF THEY WERE STOPPED BY OFFICERS AFTER RAISING HIM TO RESPECT AND ADMIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. I ASK YOUR I WROTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I THINK WE'VE ALL HEARD. WHEN OUR COLLEAGUES FROM GARDENA STOOD UP AND PRESENTED THIS BILL WE ALL HEARD THE PASSION. AND THE FEAR. IN HIS VOICE. AND THAT PASSION AND FEAR IS ROOTED IN HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT EXPERIENCE WHILE SOME OF US AND ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO WERE BORN WHITE. HAVE NOT HAD TO EXPERIENCE BENEFIT NOT HAD TO GO THROUGH OUR DAILY BUSINESS WITHOUT FEAR. IT IS NOT ONE THAT WE CAN OR SHOULD DISCOUNT IN ANY WAY. AND SO WHILE SOME OF US MAY FEEL THAT WELL YOU KNOW ARE WE GOING TO EXTREMES ARE WE TRYING TO CORRECT FOR SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT BE. SO SIGNIFICANT. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND IS A SIGNIFICANT ON ONLY A SMALL PERCENT WERE NOT A SMALL BUT RATHER A SEGMENT. OF OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND MYSELF WE DO NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT FEAR YES WE MAY ENCOUNTER A DIFFICULT. EXPERIENCE WITH A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BUT IN THAT DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE WE ARE NOT WORRYING ABOUT. BEING KILLED. SO THAT BUT THE OTHER REALITY THE OTHER REALITY IS THAT IT IS A SMALL PERCENT OF OFFICERS WHO. VIOLATE TEACHERS BREAK THE LAW OR EVEN PULL THEIR WEAPONS ARE SOMETIMES AN OFFICER HAS TO PULL A WEAPON FOR VERY LEGITIMATE REASONS BUT IT IS STILL A SMALL PERCENTAGE. AND WHAT THIS BILL. IS REALLY GIVING US THE TOOLS TO DO. IS TO BE ABLE AS OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT. TO BE ABLE TO ROOT OUT. THOSE OFFICERS THAT HAVE A PROVEN. HISTORY OF VIOLATING THE LAW. VIOLATING PROCEDURES. FOR TAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND VERY UNFORTUNATELY AS CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS AND WHILE WE HAD MANY BILLS AROUND THESE TYPES OF SUBJECT AREAS. I HEARD HOURS OF TESTIMONY FROM FAMILIES WHO LOST LOVED ONES TO OFFICERS AND ONCE THEY FINALLY WERE ABLE TO GET RECORDS WHICH WE AS YOU RECALL CALIFORNIA HAD A FORTY YEAR BAN ON ANY PUBLIC RECORDS SO WE COULD NOT FIND OUT. WHETHER AN OFFICER HAD A PAST HISTORY. OF HAVING- PULL THE WEAPON OR READ VIOLENCE AGAINST- A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS BUT ONCE THOSE FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO GET THE RECORDS THEY FOUND IN MANY CASES NOT ALL THAT THE OFFICER HAD A HISTORY OF THAT CONDUCT THAT IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH DEATH AT THE HANDS OF THAT OFFICER. THAT IS WHY WE NEED THIS BILL AND AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO REFERENCED WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW STATES WHO DOES NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR DECERTIFICATION OF OFFICERS THIS CORRECT STAFF. IT WILL NOT BE USED WIDELY AND IT WILL NOT BE USED WIDELY BECAUSE THERE IS NOT THAT MANY OFFICERS WHO. WHO DESERVE TO BE CERTIFIED BUT FOR THOSE WHO DO WE NEED THIS TOOL AND WITH THAT I ASK THE ARRIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER CENTER ALAN. MEMBERS LET ME START BY THINKING ALL OF THE SENATORS ARE WORKING HARD ON THIS IMMENSELY IMPORTANT BILL. HI THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE PROCEDURES TO ENSURE. THAT WE'RE JUST NOT PASSING ALONG BAD COPS WHO ENGAGE IN BAD BEHAVIOR AND THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND IS IN AS WELL. THAT THE MANY MANY OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM THE BATCH EVERY DAY TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND FOR WHOM- THE FOLKS THAT HAVE DISHONORED THE POLICE PROFESSION. REALLY A CAUSE TREMENDOUS PAIN AND DAMAGE AND IF ANYTHING. GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS IMPORTANTE CERTIFICATION ISSUE IS GOING TO. MAKE LIFE BETTER. FOR THOSE- HONORABLE PEOPLE WHO. WHO SERVE HONORABLY AS AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SO. I'M UP FOR THAT MANY OTHER REASONS I'M I'M IN SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GETTING OUT AND ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. PUBLIC POLICY CHALLENGE- THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS A SOCIETY. ALL I WILL SAY- THE PRETENDED MENTION THERE'S STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A WORK IN PROGRESS THIS BILL I WANT TO THINK OF WHAT THE LETTERS THE LETTER OF SENATORS WHO WORKED. HARD ON GETTING INTO THIS PLACE SO FAR. AND I DO JUST WANT TO. SAY THAT I AM STRUCK BY THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY CENTER- WHO WHO SPOKE ABOUT. THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD I DO THINK IN THE END OF THE DAY ON THIS WE NEED TO CREATE A FAIRBOARD. WE ARE GIVING THIS BOARD. A QUASI JUDICIAL POWERS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO TRY TO DIMINISH. THE POWERS BUT IF YOU GO INTO THE- LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AT THE- THE DECISIONS OF THIS BOARD- REALLY ARE. GOING TO BE VERY INFLUENTIAL AS TO THE FINAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH- POLICE OFFICERS- A STATUS. IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE IT WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO SKEW. TOWARD FOLKS ARE GONNA BE PRETTY SKEPTICAL OF- A POLICE AND I KNOW THAT THE DEBATE. THERE IS A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO REPRESENT THE POLICE WANTED TO BE HALF POLICE AND HALF NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN. I MEASURED MORE IN A MODEL AKIN TO. THE SORTS OF BOARDS THAT WE HAVE THAT OVERSEE ALL SORTS OF. OF A OF A PROFESSIONS WHICH IS DOMINATED BY REGULAR FOLKS CIVILIANS. WHO ARE NOT. MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- BUT- WHO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TREAT THESE ISSUES FAIRLY- AND I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT BALANCE TO STRIKE. AND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT- THE AUTHOR AND IN THE FOLKS AS THIS BILL MOVES ALONG- AS IT GOES TO THE ASSEMBLY IN AS THEY ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS. WITH EVERYBODY INVOLVED THAT WE'LL GET TO A PLACE WHERE THIS BOARD. IS SOMETHING THAT IS FAIR- THAT WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A CLEAR DECISIONS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN GETTING BAD COPS OFF THE STREET. AND MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR EVERYBODY. I IT IS ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO ENGAGE IN THE MARCH OF THE LEMONS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS AMONG SOME OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS WHERE- WHERE. I HAVE SOME ERRANT OFFICERS BASICALLY IT PASSED ON TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT AND THEN THEY GO ON. AND REPEATING THE SAME. BEHAVIOR HOW WE TO BREAK THE CYCLE AND THAT'S I. PLEASED THAT- THIS BILL MOVING FOR LET'S THE BOARD IS. I. THIS ACTUALLY INVESTIGATED PROSECUTED AND CONVICTED. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OF CORRUPTION AND OR ABUSE. OF THEIR POWER- THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BILL IS THIRTY THREE PAGES YOU SHOULD READ IT. IS THERE AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE CERTIFYING THOSE WHO ABUSE THEIR POWER. ABSOLUTELY NOT IN FACT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PARTICIPATING YOU LISTEN TO THE LITANY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO ALL SAID WE SHOULD HAVE A PROCESS TO DECERTIFY POLICE OFFICERS THOSE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ABUSE THEIR POWER. THAT QUESTION I THINK IT IS RESOLVED. THE OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THESE ARE TOO DISPARATE ISSUES ONE WAS THE BANE ACT AND WHAT THE TRIGGERS WOULD BE FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TO BE PERSONALLY LIABLE IS THEY SHOULD BE AS THEY SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY ABUSE. THE QUESTION WAS IS TO THE TRIGGER AS SOME OF YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T VOTE ON THE BILL BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS WE SHOULD. IT IS THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS IT IN A WAY. THAT FIXES THE ISSUE AND DOESN'T SIMPLY TURN OVER THE COURTS WAS THERE IMPROVEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE BANE ACT ABSOLUTELY THERE WAS IMPROVEMENT. IS THERE STILL AMBIGUITY THERE STILL AMBIGUITY AS TO THE TERM CONSTITUTES A CRIME OF VIOLENCE. SHOULD WE FIX THAT WE SHOULD FIX THAT. IS THERE AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE ADVISORY PANEL. THE PANEL IS NOT JUST AN ADVISORY PANEL IT SIMPLY GIVES RECOMMENDATIONS THIS IS A REAL PANEL THAT HAS AUTHORITY. THIS IS A REAL PANEL THAT CAN. MAKE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT MANY FOLKS LIVES. HAVE THERE BEEN JURIES HAVE THERE BEEN FACT FINDERS HISTORICALLY THAT IT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THOSE. PERSONS OF COLOR ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. IS THE WAY TO FIX THAT PROBLEM TO SAY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GOING TO SKEW IT IN ANOTHER DIRECTION WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THE PERCEPTION. IF NOT THE REALITY. THAT THIS PANEL. IS SKEWED TO CORRECT THE INJUSTICES OF THE PAST. I THINK NOT. I THINK THAT THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IT IS IMPORTANT IS THIS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IS A STARGATE YOU ABSOLUTELY IT'S HISTORIC ISSUE THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF VOTES THAT FOLKS LET ME REMEMBER THOSE OF US WHO SERVE WHETHER IT'S A TWELVE OR HOWEVER MANY YEARS THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF VOTES AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT FOLKS REMEMBER ABSOLUTELY IT'S AN ISSUE THAT FOLKS REMEMBER. ANI GIVE CREDIT TO MY COLLEAGUE ESPECIALLY FROM GARDENA FOR ADVANCING THIS ISSUE. BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR THAT IS RIGHT. WE HAVE TO DO IT NO WHERE A WAY. THAT THE COURTS WON'T MANIPULATED. LIKE AS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BANE ACT. SHOULD THIS PROCESS MOVE FORWARD IT SHOULD IT SHOULD NOT DIE TODAY. SHOULD GO TO THE ASSEMBLY TYPICALLY ASSEMBLY SO THAT IT CAN BE APPROVED IT SHOULD. THEREFORE- BOWTIE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER- BURKE CENTER SURE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU- FIRST I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE AUTHOR- AS I DID DURING THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR NOT JUST THE POLICY EDUCATION BUT THE PERSONAL ID CATION- THEY'RE NOT GOING THROUGH EXPERIENCING. IT THROUGH HIS EYES- SOMETHING THAT I CANNOT FEEL- WHAT IT IS TO WALK AROUND ON THE STREETS. AS A PERSON OF COLOR. SPECIFICALLY AS A BLACK MAN. AND THE YOUNG NOBLE FEAR. THAT IS ASSOCIATE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT NOT JUST BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC RACISM BUT BECAUSE OF. THE INADEQUACIES OF CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FIXING HERE TODAY. WE WON'T FIX THE WHOLE ISSUE. AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT. WE HAVE TO GET THIS WORK DONE THIS YEAR. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PASS THIS BILL TODAY. I ALSO BELIEVE WE NEEDED THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I SHOULD ADD THAT. THE MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREE. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO A SINGLE PERSON. IN LAW ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T AGREE THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE AS DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO. HAD THEIR KIDS MURDERED. AND STILL HAVE NO ACCESS TO JUSTICE. NEED SOME JUSTICE. AND THE RECYCLING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO. I FEEL A SENSE OF IMPUNITY AND IMMUNITY HAS TO END. SO I APPRECIATE THE WORK AND THE GOOD FAITH SHOWN ESPECIALLY IN OUR- OUR HARD WORK ON THE DANE ACT ISSUES IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORS. WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES AND TO MOVE. BUT I DON'T I DON'T APPRECIATE. AN UNDERLYING RULE OF THUMB THAT SEEMS TO HAVE EMERGED IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THAT SOMEHOW IT IS RACIST TO ASK QUESTIONS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE WHITE. BUT SOMEHOW DIGGING INTO DETAILS HERE AND DOING THE WORK AS A SENATOR. WAS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. SOMEHOW NOT OUR PURVIEW. NO WE SHOULD FEEL ASHAMED. ARE GUILTY OF DIGGING IN. DETAILS MATTER. GETTING THIS RIGHT MATTERS WE WILL SET THE PACE FOR THIS COUNTRY I HOPE THIS CONGRESS IS WATCHING I HOPE THEY PASS THE GEORGE FLOYD JUST POLICING ACT AND I HOPE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT IT IS UNFAIR AND IT IS. UNBECOMING OF HIS BODY. TO CASTIGATE OR DEMONISE COLLEAGUES. BASED ON THEIR RACE. WE'RE ALL ACTIVE HERE REPRESENT OUR PEOPLE. AND I THINK THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE DEBATE TODAY HERE AND GOING FORWARD. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT MUST FIGHT FIERCELY TO PROTECT. IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT SPACE ON THIS LEGISLATION OR OTHER BILLS. IF I DON'T HAVE EQUAL STANDING TO ASK A QUESTION JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE HERE. SOMETHING'S WRONG. SO IN THAT SPIRIT I. THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY. BUT THERE ARE BIG REASON THE FCTORS THAT THE COMMISSION WILL BE LOOKING TO. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES APPOINTED SOME OF THESE OUT. WHAT IS CONDUCT THAT DOESN'T RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE PUBLIC. WHAT IS THE NOT A VIOLATION OF LAW BUT SOME OTHER VIOLATION QUOTE SOME OTHER VIOLATION. THAT MIGHT LEAD TO SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF FORCE INCLUDE NOT JUST LEGAL FORCE OR ABUSIVE FORCE OR PHYSICAL MISCONDUCT PUT. BUT A MISTAKE FROM A DISPATCH OPERATOR WHERE THERE'S A MISTAKEN ARREST IN SOMEONE'S HAND CUFF IS THAT IN ON AUTHORIZE USE OF FORCE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO AFTER. THE WORST THE PEOPLE WHO DISHONOR THIS PROFESSION. THERE WERE NOT ALSO DETERRING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT TO BE GOOD OFFICERS BECAUSE WE STILL NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WHO HAVE OWNERS WHO WANT TO SERVE. I TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT. THIS TREND IN OUR POLITICS RIGHT NOW. WHERE WE BROAD BRUSH. AND OSTRACIZING DEMONIZES TOXIC I THINK IT'S GONNA ROAD THE FABRIC OF OUR DEMOCRACY IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. SO I LOVE THIS SENATE FOR ITS WORK. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF A MAJORITY LEADER JUDICIARY CHAIR THE CENTER FROM GARDENA. BUT WITH THIS PHONE HERE TODAY I HOPEWE COMMIT OURSELVES TO A DEBATE IS GOING TO BE RESPECTFUL. AND SUBSTANTIVE. ALCIDE FORCES WILL DO IT THEY MAKE COLLEAGUES BUT- WE OWE IT TO EACH OTHER TO RESERVE SPACE. TO BE THE CENTER IS THAT WE ARE. SO WITH THAT OUT HI I WILL. URGE THE AUTHOR GOING FORWARD. TO HOLD ON TO THAT SPACE IN THE COURAGE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO DO THAT. TO GET THIS RIGHT. IT'S PASSED THIS LAW THIS YEAR. RESPECTFULLY ASK DR THANK YOU SENATOR STERN SEVERAL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU KNOW I. THINK I'VE BEEN FAIRLY SUPPORTIVE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING MY TENURE HERE AND SO WHEN THIS BILL CAME FORWARD TO MY DESK I TOOK A LOOK AT IT. AND I TOO WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AND THE ROLE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AND IF IN FACT THE ADVISORY BOARD HAD THE ACTUAL AUTHORITY TO- MAKE DETERMINATIONS- AND IN FACT MAKE A INITIAL DETERMINATION ON THE DECERTIFICATION OF. A PULLEY UP A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I WONDERED WHY. THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD WAS THE- WHICH MADE UP THE WAY IT WAS WITH. A COUPLE PEACE OFFICERS AND CAN ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT- SEEM TO BE- NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE PEACE OFFICERS ON THE BOARD IN ANY EVENT IT CAUSE ME SOME. SOME CONCERN AND THEN I USED TO BE A LAWYER MANY YEARS AGO I DON'T CLAIM TO BE SO ANYMORE BUT I DID LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF- SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND I WAS I WAS BOTHERED BY THE- THE USE OF TERMS SUCH AS VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND I SAID WELL WHAT WAS IT A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR. AN INFRACTION- SOMETHING ELSE THAT WASN'T DEFINED AND I WAS ALSO BOTHERED BY. THE FOLLOW ON TO THAT PHRASE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFINITIONAL SECTIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT INCLUDED WORDS LIKE OR OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF A PEACE OFFICER WORDS LIKE THAT. AND SO I WAS BOTHERED BY THOSE THINGS AND I TOOK A LOOK AT- AT THE BILL. ITSELF AND PERHAPS I'VE MISSED SOMETHING BUT WHAT I FOUND WITH RESPECT TO THE ADVISORY BOARD IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD. IS THAT THE BOARD'S. PURPOSE IN THE STATUTE. AND THE RESULT OF FREE IS MAKE RIGHT. ON THE DC. OF PEACE OFFICERS TO THE COMMISSION TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN I LOOKED. AT HOW THAT PROCESS PLAYS OUT AND IT PLAYS OUT BYE. THE COMPLAINT. SAID AN INVESTIGATION BY INVESTIGATING OFFICERS EMBEDDED IN THIS NEW DIVISION. IN POST. ANY OF THOSE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS AND THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION RESULT IN A- RECOMMENDATION OF THE DECERTIFICATION. NOT THE OTHER WAY THE OFFICERS THEN NO NOTIFIED AND THE OFFICER HAS THE RIGHT TO RESUME REQUEST A REVIEW. AN APPEAL INCLUDING THIS REVIEW INITIALLY BY THE ADVISORY BOARD. AND SO ONLY IF THIS INVESTIGATION RESULTS IN A FINDING AND RECOMMENDATION OR CONCLUSION OF DECERTIFICATION DOES IT GET TO THE ADVISORY BOARD AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE ADVISORY BOARD IF AN INVESTIGATION IS NOT INITIATED APPARENTLY UNDER OTHER PROVISIONS THE BILL HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INDEPENDENTLY. DIRECTOR REQUESTS ARE INITIATED INVESTIGATION BY THE DIVISION IT DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DIRECT A PARTICULAR OUTCOME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY. IF THERE IS A FINDING OF DECERTIFICATION THROUGH THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS THE ADVISORY BOARD HAS A PUBLIC HEARING AND DECIDES CONFIRMS THAT THAT FINDING IS SUPPORTED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO POST TO CONTINUE WITH THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. THE ADVISORY BOARD DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY IF THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDES THE DECERTIFICATION IS INAPPROPRIATE AS I READ THE BILL TO REVERSE THE DETERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR IN THE DIVISION. AND INDEPENDENTLY INITIATE A PROCESS TO DECERTIFY. I'LL STAND CORRECTED IF SOMEBODY CAN POINT ME TO A SECTION THE SECTIONS ARE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THIRTEEN FIVE TEN POINT EIGHT FIVE. SURVEY THAT CETERA SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BOARD CAN'T RIVERS HIT INDEPENDENTLY COME UP WITH A RECOMMENDATION OF DECERTIFICATION MOVE THAT FORWARD TO POST. WELL I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AND THINK FROM A PUBLIC PERCEPTION STANDPOINT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PEACE OFFICERS AND YOU WANT COMMUNITY ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER SIDE MAYBE THOSE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO TWO. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD MAKE A LAWYER. HAVING BEEN ONE MYSELF. A MEMBER OF AN ADVISORY BOARD AS OPPOSED TO BEING AN ADVISER TO THE ADVISORY BOARD I'M NOT SURE THAT THESE CONCERNS. ARE NECESSARILY DETERMINATIVE AND I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE CERTAINLY. THE PROCESS NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD AND IN APPROPRIATE CASES OFFICERS NEED TO BE- DECERTIFIED AND AS I MAY HAVE MENTIONED. MY CONCERNS OVER THE VAGUENESS OF THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WELL I. THINK IF THOSE ARE NOT CURED THERE ARE NOT BEING A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS HERE. ABOUT VAGUENESS AND WHETHER DUE PROCESS ISSATISFIED. I'M CONFIDENT AND COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO LET THE REGULATORY PROCESS MOVE FORWARD AND LET THE REGULATORY PROCESS FLASH OUTDOORS TERMS. PUT MEAT ON THE BONES OF THAT THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THOSE THAT ARE. JUDGING THE OFFICERS HAVE SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO MAKE A DETERMINATION IN THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT CASE SO. WITH THOSE COMMENTS- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR ROBERTS SENATOR COM WONDER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO AND APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA. FOR CARRYING THIS BATTLE- AND THE WATER THIS YEAR ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE YOU KNOW S. B. TWO. IT IS. IT REALLY JUST A CONTINUED STEP IN RE ENGINEERING POLICY BACK TO ITS APPROPRIATE INTENT SOMETIMES NOT ORIGINAL INTENT BUT APPROPRIATE CONTENT. AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT SP TWO IS ABOUT PROTECTING CITIZENS PROTECTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THAT CAN COEXIST. YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS TODAY. PRACTICE IS NOT CONSISTNT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. ACTRESSES ARE NOT CONSISTENT POLICIES ARE NOT CONSISTENTLY APPLIED CONSISTENTLY ENFORCED. THAT IS THE ISSUE HOW DO I KNOW THIS WELL DESERVED TO EXAMPLES THAT HAPPENED LIKE JUST. ONE LAST WEEK IN ONE TWO MONTHS AGO. IN THE SOUTH GATE AREA YOUNG LATINA. I WAS HAVING SOMETHING HAD GONE AWRY. TO ENFORCE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAME TOGETHER. SHE GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION HE WAS ON ARMED. HE WAS MAD. ONE OFFICER HEY THERE THROUGH TO THE GRAND ON THE GRASS AND LITERALLY STARTED PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. IN THE FACE. HER PARTNER HIS PARTNER DIDN'T STOP HIM HE'S NOT READY I'LL STOP IN AND SETS BUILD DON'T DO THAT. ALL AND HE DID AND YOU SAW REASON HAPPY IN HIS HEAD. AND THEY CONTINUE TO WITH THIS. ABOUT WHY SHE HAD BEEN ARRESTED. LAST WEEKEND IN HUNTING BEACH. THERE WAS A PARTY SOME OF SALVATOR PARTY. AND OF YOUNG PEOPLE SHOWED UP FOR THIS PARTY THAT WAS FAKE OKAY WHEN THEY WERE HERE TO TAKE THAT. AND STARTED RIGHT. JUMPING ON TOP OF POLICE. BREAKING THE GLASS SETTING OFF SMOKE IN FIERY FIREWORKS JUMPING IN FRONT OF THE FACES OF POLICE OFFICERS. THOSE POLICE OFFICERS HAD NO RIGHT HERE THEY HAD NOT CALLED IN THE SWAT TEAM. THEY WERE NOT USING ANYONE KNOW BILLY CLUBS. THERE ARE. BUT FOR SOMETHING SO YES. THERE WAS LOTS OF ORDER. IS INCONSISTENT. NOW YOU CAN FILL IN THE REST OF. THE DOCKS ABOUT WHO WAS WHO. AND WHAT THEY LIKE. BUT THAT IS THAT THE ROOT OF THESE EGGS THAT I SHARING WITH YOU AND AT THE ROOT THIS BIG. I HAVE TO TELL YOU. RIGHT NOW BAIL ANSWERS EVERY HIGH WITHOUT IN EVERY INNING THAT IS NOT THE G. OF LAW THE JOB OF LAW NOT TO SORT OF PRESUPPOSED HUMAN NATURE GOING TO. I ABOUT GARDENING AND STAY. AND TO PRAY. AND POLICY AND YES FAITH IN PEOPLE. TO INTERPRET WITH CONSCIOUSNESS AND FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU SEE A PATTERN OF A GREAT BUSINESS THAT IS WHEN YOU STEP IN AND RE EXAMINE POLICY. BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PARSE OUT EVERY SINGLE THING. IN HOPES OF FINDING THE NOVEL. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FAITH IN THE PROCESS AND MY FRIENDS THIS THING GETS OFF THE FLOOR IT STILL HAS TO GO OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY. THERE ARE SOME PROCESS. TO ENGAGE IN THE QUESTIONS. SO THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF WITH THIS BILL. I HAVE TO TELL YOU HEY IT'S REALLY HARD TO PROSECUTE A POLICE OFFICER STANDARD PROOF KIND OF HIGH. PROSECUTORS DON'T LIKE TO DO THOSE CASES. BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE TO LOSE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. WE DON'T HAVE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL ANYTHING. OKAY ANYTHING WE STRIVE FOR BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT. NUMBER THREE. WITH REGARDS TO PEOPLE THOSE WORDS ON THAT SHEET OF PAPER CATEGORIES THEY'RE NOT TELLING YOU WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE. NEWS FLASH BLACK FOLKS BROWN FOLKS PRETTY CONSERVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WE LIKE TO BE SAFE TO. WE CALLED THE POLICE TO. SO LET'S NOT PRESUPPOSE THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO MIGHT FILL THAT CATEGORY ALL THOSE BOARD MEMBERS TO GET LAW ENFORCEMENT. I PREFER TO THINK THAT WE WILL PASS THIS THAT IT WILL GO TO THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS THAT PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR BRETHREN WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT S. B. TO. TWEAK IT IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT MORE RIGHTEOUS. BUT ALSO CONSIDER THIS. WE MAY IN PASSING AND SPEED TO. CREATE A SCENARIO. WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FIND COMFORT IN A PROCESS THAT MAY ALLOW THEM. TO BE SAFE. BECAUSE NO THE BAD COPS. SO DO BAD THINGS AND THEY BULLY AND THEY HARASS INTIMIDATE. AND THEY MAKE YOU HOLD TO A BLUE COLOR PUT EVEN YOUR BLUE BROTHERS AT. AND I WANT TO PUT THOSE MANY WOMEN. JUST LIKE I WANT TO PROTECT MY HUSBAND JUST LIKE I WANT TO PROTECT MY SON. SO I URGE YOU TO HAVE FAITH. HAVE FAITH IN THIS BODY IN THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS DEAL HAVE SOME SENSE AND SENSIBILITIES ABOUT THEM. AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PAST THAT IS RIGHTEOUS AND APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY THE PRACTICE OF HOW PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED AND KEPT SAFE AND WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE NOT. SO I URGE YOU TO VOTE HI. ON SP TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR COM LONGER CENTER BECKER. CAN YOU HEAR ME TODAY YES. FIFTY TWO GREAT ACCOUNTABILITY LAW ENFORCEMENT CASES OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. SICH GEORGE FLOYD WAS MURDERED ONE THOUSAND SIXTY EIGHT PEOPLE HAVE DIED AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ONE THOUSAND SIXTY EIGHT PEOPLE. WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT DOES NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR DECERTIFICATION. EVERY MONTH ABSOLUTELY ACT ON THE CERTIFICATION THIS YEAR. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREES AND THIS WILL RESTORE. TRUST IT RESTORE THE CONSISTENCY. THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES TO FOR TWO. IT WILL RESTORE FAITH. AND ALLOW US TO WEED OUT THE BAD APPLES I THINK IT'S NOT JUST A JUSTICE ACT IN EQUITY ACT. ALONG THOSE LINES. I BELIEVE WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD GREATER DETAIL AROUND THE ACTS THAT MAYOR DE CERTIFICATION AND EXTENT OF RETROACTIVITY. I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS GOING FORWARD. AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT SB TWO TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO RISE BRIEFLY. THIS MORNING IN AND WHILE I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED BY OUR MANY COLLEAGUES. I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT I AM INSPIRED BY THE DEBATE THIS MORNING. I'M INSPIRED BY THE HOPEFULNESS. OF THE CONVERSATION. THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE AS IT CONTINUES ON. AND I GENUINELY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THIS BILL TO A SPOT WHERE I CAN SUPPORT IT AND MANY OF THE OTHERS OF US THAT HAVE CONCERNS. CAN SUPPORT. AS I'VE SHARED. MY SON IN LAW IS A POLICE OFFICER CURRENTLY. I HAVE MANY ERY CLOSE FRIENDS THAT ARE POLICE OFFICERS. AND I KNOW. THAT THEY'RE THE GOOD COPS. AND I KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO TOLERATE THE BAD COPS. AND SO I APPRECIATE SINCERELY THE AUTHORS OPENING COMMENTS AND HOW PASSIONATELY AND SINCERE HE IS IN THE CONCERNED FOR THIS BILL. AND THE CONCERNED AND THE PASSION THAT EACH OF US HAS SHARED THIS MORNING ON MAKING SURE THAT THIS BILL BECOMES. WHAT IT CAN BE. AND THEN I CAN HAVE. ACROSS THE BOARD SUPPORT AND SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT THIS MORNING THAT- I APPRECIATE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE THIS MORNING AND THE PROFESSIONALISM THAT WE'VE ALL SHARED IN THESE IN THIS CONVERSATION IN THIS DEBATE AND I'M HOPEFUL FOR THIS BILL COMING BACK ON CONCURRENCE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR JONES MEMBERS IS THERE ANY FURTHER. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND LET ME START OFF BY THANKING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TO. LET THEIR VOICE TO THIS DISCUSSION. THIS AFTERNOON. IT'S INCREDIBLE VOICE THAT NEEDS TO BE HEARD. AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT TRULY IT'S TIME HAS CALLED. AND. I'VE LEARNED IN MY TWENTY PLUS YEARS AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THE HARDEST THING ARE THE SIMPLEST THINGS. THE HARDEST THINGS TO GET DONE OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE THE MOST SENSE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHICH MAKES THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK INSIDE YOUR HEART. BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT YOURSELF YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT. POLICING TENDERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION AND IT'S NOT HERE TO BUY THE ENTIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO CLEARLY SHOW BIAS THERE'S INDIVIDUALS WHO CLEARLY COMMIT CRIMES AND IT'S BEEN DIVISIONS WHO SHOULD TRULY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT TRUST. IT'S ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S ABOUT FAIRNESS. THIS IS NOT AN ANTI POLICE BUILT ITS EIGHT ANTI BAD COP BILL AND AGAIN THAT'S WHO WE ARE TARGETING AND IF YOUR HEAD IS IN THE SAND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE BAD COPS THEY'RE BAD COPS COPS WHO ARE GANG MEMBERS THEY'RE COPS WHO ARE RAPISTS THEY'RE COPS WHO ARE MURDERERS THERE ARE COPS WHO WERE ALL THOSE THINGS FRAMING PEOPLE AND THAT'S THE REALITY BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE YOU PUT ON A UNIFORM AND A BADGE DOESN'T REMOVE YOU FROM THE TRUMAN FERAL TREES IN THOSE STANDS BECAUSE. THEY DO COME OUT. AND I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE POLICE I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE POLICE OFFICERS HAVE A GOOD FRIEND THAT WE'VE BEEN FOR FORTY PLUS YEARS HE JUST WROTE A BOOK BEING BLACK IN BLUE. EXPLAINING HIS THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AS THE LAPD OFFICER BEING BLACK IN BLUE. IN THE BIASES THAT HE FACED AS A POLICE OFFICER THE BIASES THAT HE CLEARLY SAW IN THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. PURSES HE WAS PATROLLING THE WEST SIDE. AND EVERYBODY WAS GIVEN TE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WHEN THEY DO LOOK LIKE HIM. BEING GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE FAIRLY. HOLDING THOSE OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE WHO DO NOT TREAT PEOPLE FAIRLY. THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT MEMBERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO A BENCH YOU OF THAT. BECAUSE AGAIN. IF MY WHITE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE BEING TREATED IN THE SAME WAY. AS BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN AS MY OTHER COLLEAGUE FROM ELLIE SAYS LOOK DEALS ARE BEING KILLED AT A HIGHER RATE. THAN AFRICAN AMERICANS RIGHT NOW BY LAW ENFORCERS. BUT I GUESS IT'S FINE BECAUSE IF YOU LIVE IN LAGUNA GAL. FRESNO BEAVER. FULLERTON ORINDA BAKERSFIELD. SANTI THANK HER IRVINE SANTA CLARITA YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT THOSE ISSUES YOU NEVER SEE A PERSON BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THEIR HOUSE PICKUP IN BEING BEATEN TO DEATH OR SHOT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. BUT IT DOES IF YOU'RE BLACK AND BROWN EVEN IF YOU LIVE IN A FLOWING COMMUNITIES. THAT'S FORMER SENATOR KEVIN MURRAY. WHO'S PROFILED IN BEVERLY HILLS DRAGGED OUT OF HIS CAR IN FELONY PRONE TO OUT IN THE MIDDLE RODEO DRIVE A STATE SENATOR. HE WAS GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. AND THIS IS ALL THIS IS ABOUT HOLDING THOSE OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. WHO TRULY ABUSED THEIR POWER. AND EIGHT BIG DO EXIST THEY'RE NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN. WHO PUT THAT UNIFORM ON BECAUSE AGAIN. WE WOULD HAVE ANARCHY IN THE STREET IF THAT WERE THE CASE. BUT THOSE BAD OFFICERS DO EXIST. THIS BILL PROVIDES A FAIR. TRANSPARENT WAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ABOUT THE COMPOSITION. OF THE TASK FORCE ADVISORY BOARD. THAT IS THERE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE END OF THE DAY. ALL STILL HAS THE FINAL SAY. THEY STILL HAVE THE FINAL SAY BUT SOMETHING STRIKING YOU GUYS SHOULD KNOW MOST POLICE SHOOTINGS ARE NEVER REPORTED THEY'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO REPORT THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD NOT EVER OBLIGATED TO REPORT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING SHOT. IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION HAS NOW DEMANDED BILLS THAT INFORMATION COME FOR. YES I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. A LOT OF THINGS. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE FAIR IT SHOULD BE. WHERE WE TRUST THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO RESPOND TO A CALL IT A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ARE HESITANT TO CALL THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN THEY GET THERE WE'VE SEEN. STORY AFTER STORY. AND I AS A BLACK MAN. MY STORIES PRIOR YOU NEED TO. FAR DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF YOU GUYS BECAUSE I ASSURE YOU. MY WHITE COLLEAGUES HAVE NEVER HAD TO TALK. YOUR PARENTS NEVER HAD TO GIVE YOU THAT TALK. YOU NEVER HAD TO GIVE THAT TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN BUT I HIT THE TOP WHEN I GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND THEY TOLD ME WHAT I SHOULD DO NOT IF I GET STOPPED. WHEN I GET STOPPED. AND THAT HAPPENS IN EVERY BLACK AND BROWN FAMILY ACROSS AMERICA BECAUSE IT'S NOT A IF. IT IS A WIN. AND I'VE LOST TRACK OF THE NUMBER TIMES I GOT STOPPED BY THE POLICE. AS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST STOP BY THE SHARES PULLED OUT OF MY CAR FORCED TO PUT MY HAND ON A HOT RUNNING CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST ON A BLACK HOOD SIMPLY BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE I DON'T LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ME. I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ME. OR AS A YOUNG MARKETING REP WHAT IBM LEAVING DOWNTOWN LA GOING UP PEOPLE BOULEVARD. AND I CUT ACROSS THE MYTHS IN TRAFFIC TO GO UP OLYMPIC HAPPEN TO GO DOWN THE STREET THAT I GUESS THE CURBS ARE BARE THEY STILL WERE SELLING DRUGS OUT THERE I DON'T STOP NOBODY RAN INTO MY CAR TO SELL ME ANY DRUGS. THROUGH THE GOOD TO OLYMPIC I'M STOPPED BY LAPD BUT SEE THE IBM FOLDER MY ON MY FRONT SEAT WHICH IBM EQUIPMENT ON MY FRONT SEAT. BUT MY CAR WAS RANSACKED ALL THE STUFF THROWN ALL AROUND MY CAR AND I'M PROBABLY STILL ON SOME LIST OF BEING A SUSPECT PURCHASING DRUGS AND I PUT MY CAR I NEVER STOP MY CAR JUST COLLECTED OVER A STREET BUT THEY SAID THEY. SELL DRUGS ON. MANY GUYS VERY THAT. FULL OF THINGS TO HAPPEN ALL THE DEBT ALL TIME AND THOSE ARE BAD OFFICERS WHO DO THAT AND OFFICER WHO ME OUT OF MY CAR AS I SCHOOLS. ABOUT YEARS LATER A LIST OF QUESTIONABLE SHARES AN LAPD I NEVER WOULD FORGET THAT OFFICER'S NAME. HE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. HE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN SAY THAT CONVINCE YOU. AT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS IS TRULY THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF WE WANT TO HAVE TRUST WE WANT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE. IN ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE SAID ABOUT. WHO WHO WANTS IS THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE CLEARLY GONE ON RECORD THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS HAVE GONE ON RECORD AND SAID WE NEED POLICE REFORM. HERE IN AMERICA. WE NEEDED HOW MANY MORE LIVES NEED TO BE LOST UNNECESSARILY. HOW MANY MORE WHAT HE PUT MORE VALUE ON A COMPOSITION ON A BOARD. OR THE LOSS OF LIFE. I REALLY HAGGLE OVER THE COMPOSITION ABOARD THE LOVE LIFE TO CONTINUE TO BE LOST. BUT SOME OF US ARE USING THAT AS A OUR REASON TO HIDE BEHIND THIS. DR KING. OFTEN STATED THERE COMES A TIME. WHEN ONE MUST TAKE A POSITION. THAT'S NEITHER SAFE. NO POLITIC NOR POPULAR. BUT HERE SHE TAKES THE POSITION BECAUSE THEIR CROTCHES TELLS THEM IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WHAT IS YOUR CONSCIENCE TELL YOU TODAY MEMBERS. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND A NO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE SAYS I'M FINE WITH LEAVING THE NAME ON THE KNACK OF CALIFORNIANS I'M FINE ON LEAVING THE NEED OF THE KNACK OF AMERICAN SPECIALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR WHAT THE YOU LIVE IN A MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY OR POOR COMMUNITY. AGAIN KEVIN ROSS JUNIOR LIVED IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. HE WAS SHOT AT THE PARK THAT I GREW UP PLAYING AT A PARK THAT I CALLED FOR SIXTEEN YEARS A PARK THAT I HOSTED JAZZ BOTH OF IT SOME OF YOU HERE HAVE ATTENDED. I DON'T LIVE IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD. THE MAJORITY OF MY SECOND MY NEIGHBORHOOD YES ALPHANUMERIC. WE MAKE UP THE HIGHEST EDUCATION THE HIGHEST INCOME PER CAPITA FOR THE FIFTY TWO YEARS OF MY FAMILY HAS LIVED THERE. SO WE DON'T LIVE IN A HIGH CRIME AREA. BEGIN A FROST JUNIOR RUNNING ACROSS THE PARK. GOT SHOT IN THE BACK TWICE. AND I CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON ABOUT THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO. WERE MISTREATED A STELLAR RODNEY KING. WE ALL REMEMBER THAT. BEATEN ALMOST WITHIN AN INCH OF HIS LIFE BY FOUR OFFICERS SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS SPEEDING. AT A HONDA. LAST TIME ON THEY DID NINETY MILES HOURS PRIOR GOING DOWNHILL WITH NO BRAKES. YOU LOVE A SINGLE MOTHER. WHO SHOT ON HER PORCH SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HELD A NIGHT. ON THE PORCH AND SAID. I DON'T WANT MY CAR MY GAS TO BE TURNED OFF SO I CAN FEED MY KIDS AND HEAT MY HOME. RON SETTLES. THE YOUNG MAN ALL AMERICAN FOOTBALL PLAYER ON HIS WAY TO THE NFL. STOP BY SIGNAL HILL POLICE DEPARTMENT AND HOURS LATER HE'S MYSTERIOUSLY HONG AND HIS CELL WAS ANYBODY EVER CHARGE ON THAT NO.

I MEAN YOU GUYS WOULD BE OKAY IF YOUR GRANDCHILD WAS KILLED IN YOUR BACKYARD ALL THEY GOT WAS A CELL PHONE. BUT IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS BUT IT DOES HAPPEN IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO YOUR FAMILY IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO YOUR KIDS AND THIS IS ALL WE'RE SAYING LET'S MAKE THE PROCESS FAIR. LET'S MAKE PEOPLE HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. LET'S YOU KNOW DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS BEEN BADGERED ABOUT RACE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE BUT THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLA- ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM HIS RACE ON EVERYTHING THAT WE DO THIS PANDEMIC IS SHOWN WHERE THE PRISONERS EXIST IN AMERICA WHETHER IT'S HEALTH DISPARITIES WHETHER IT'S HOUSING WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION HAVING INTERNET WHETHER IT'S FAIR POLICING RACE IS AT THE CENTER OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS SO HAVING UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE. I'M SORRY MY MOTHER HAD TO SAY IT I HIT DOG YELLS THE LOUDEST SO IF WE STRUCK A NERVE HEY GOD BLESS YOU. BUT THERE'S M.

GLAZER HER TADO. NEWMAN. FIVE TWENTY SIX THOSE NINE THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS ARE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM THIRTY TWO SENATOR ATKINS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL NINE BY SENATOR ATKINS AN ACT RELATING TO LAND USE SENATOR ATKINS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH. COLLEAGUES I- STOOD ON THIS FLOOR IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND I MADE A COMMITMENT TO FOCUS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION. DESPITE THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE DONE THAT. I AM PROUD OF ALL OF THE WORK THAT THE SENATE HOUSING LEAD GROUP AND THE CHAIR OF OUR HOUSING COMMITTEE HAVE DONE. TO PUT TOGETHER THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL. I SPECIFICALLY WANT TO THANK THE SENATORS FROM SALINAS BERKELEY SAN JOSE LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH HEATS BERG RIVER SIDE AND BALDWIN PARK. FOR THEIR WORK AND COMMITMENT TO FINDING SOLUTIONS. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS AN ISSUE SO LARGE THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY S. B. NINE IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. FOR MANY OF YOU THIS BILL WILL LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT I AUTHORED LAST SESSION S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS SIMILAR WE TOOK A GOOD BILL THAT MET THE FATE OF A HARD DEADLINE. AND AFTER LISTENING TO FEEDBACK FROM HOMEOWNERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WE IMPROVED UPON IT. SB NINE PROVIDES OPTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS BY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR THEM TO CREATE A DUPLEX OR SUBDIVIDE EXISTING LIED IN A SINGLE FAMILY ZONED. UP TO FOUR UNITS. AND I'M GONNA SAY THAT% AGAIN UP TO ONLY FOUR UNITS. PRESS B. NINE STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL AND CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE HOUSING OPTIONS. AND WE NEED THOSE OPTIONS MORE THAN EVER TO HELP ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THIS STATE. IN ORDER TO PROTECT EXISTING TENANTS HISTORIC DISTRICTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND COASTAL REQUIREMENTS SB NINE ESTABLISHES A SPECIFIC LIST OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT MUST BE MET. THE BILL ALSO PROTECTS NEIGHBORHOODS FROM SPECULATION AND GENTRIFICATION. LET ME FOCUS FOR A MINUTE ON EXACTLY HOW IT DOES THAT. S. B. NINE LIMITS INDIVIDUALS FROM RECEIVING MINISTERIALLOT SPLITS ON ADJACENT PARCELS TO PREVENT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. FROM CHANGING THE LOOK AND FEEL OF NEIGHBORHOODS. IT ALSO SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS PROFITEERS FROM ADDICTING ARE DISPLACING TENANTS BY EXCLUDING PROPERTIES WERE TENET HAS RESIDED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THE SENATE HOUSING LEAD GROUP TO IMPROVE THIS BILL. ONE MODIFICATION IS THAT THE BILL NOW PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE AUTHORITY TO ENACT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT. ANOTHER MINUTE MAKE CLEAR THE NUMBER OF UNITS ALLOWED AND AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING LIKE A VERY BROKEN RECORD I'LL SAY IT AGAIN UP TO FOUR UNITS ONLY. THERE ARE SO MANY VARIABLES THAT MAKE A NEIGHBORHOOD WHAT IT IS THE SIZE OF LIGHTS LOCAL REQUIREMENTS THE DESIRE OF HOMEOWNERS TO EVEN USE THIS OPTION. NOT EVERYONE WILL CHOOSE TO DO A LOT SPLIT OR TURN THEIR HOME INTO A DUPLEX AND THAT IS OKAY. THIS MERELY OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE WHO DO. AND I'D SAY TO THOSE WHO ARGUE THAT THIS COULD JEOPARDIZE THE LOOK OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD LOOK AROUND YOU THEY'RE ALREADY BEAUTIFUL DUPLEXES AND ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS NEXT DOOR TO TRADITIONAL SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND SOME OF OUR STATE'S MOST SOUGHT AFTER ZIP CODES. IN MY OWN DISTRICT HILLCREST NORTH PARK GOLDEN HILL. HERE IN MY HOME AWAY FROM HOME OF SACRAMENTO IN EAST SACRAMENTO AND EVEN LAND PARK. THESE ARE CHARMING HOUSES THAT ARE NOT ONLY A BRIGHT SPOT ON THE STREET BUT A COMFORTABLE PLACE. FOR NOT JUST ONE BUT TWO FAMILIES TO CALL HOME. ALONG WITH THE SAFEGUARDS INCLUDED IN MY BILL I WANT TO DISCUSS THE OPPORTUNITY IT PROVIDES FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE MORE OPTIONS TO BUILD. MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSING AND BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL ASSETS. INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IS A CURRENCY WE KNOW IS CRUCIAL TO COUNTERING IN EQUITY AND CREATING SOCIAL MOBILITY. ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS WERE OUTDATED ZONING LAWS HAVE CREATED BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND IT LED TO OVERCROWDING. THIS BILL PROVIDES HOMEOWNERS WITH OPTIONS TO PROVIDE RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER WORKING FAMILIES WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING TO FIND A HOME IN THEIR PRICE RANGE. OR WHO MAY BE LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN PATH TO A MORE AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP PLAN. A CHANCE FOR ADULT CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY GREW UP. pDOOR. THIS BILL IS AN EXPANSION OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE HOMEOWNERS RENTERS AND FAMILIES ALIKE. THE BILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE. REAL PROGRESSIVE AND POSITIVE CHANGE AND STRENGTHEN THE FABRIC OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. WITH EQUITY INCLUSIVITY AND AFFORDABILITY. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NELSON. MISPRISION LATER IN JAIL IN THE SENATE I VOTED FOR THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE. AND I BOUGHT IT. IN GOOD CONSCIENCE USUALLY I'M VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT CONSTRAINS LOCAL CONTROL OR LOCAL AUTHORITY. READING THE BILL AND LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION I DID NOT FIND THIS BILL TO BE ONEROUS AT ALL IN THAT DIRECTION. THAT I BELIEVE IT DOES MAKE GOOD SENSE. ONE CONCERN I DO HAVE IS THE SUCCESSOR LEGISLATORS WILL TRY TO GET EXEMPTED FROM THIS AS SOME HAVE A VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING ALLOWANCES. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN THIS IS REALLY A BOTTOM LINE BILL BUT IT IS IT IS A POSITIVE BILL. IT DOES MOVE US AHEAD. AND I THINK IN MANY AREAS IT WILL HELP OVERCOME THE NEED IN THE COMPLEX. I WOULD LOOK AT MAYBE IS A BIT OF A BALANCE. I DON'T WANT TO CALL THE COMPROMISE WITH THE BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE INTERESTS. THAT DON'T WANT TO HAVE SUCH DENSITY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. IT ISN'T THAT RELATED TO DUPLEXES. THAT IS NOT THE MOST ONEROUS I'VE LIVED IN DUPLEXES. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES HERE. IS THE SOLUTION. AND THE REPUTATION OF THE PRO TEM MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. THAT MEANS THE ITEM AND THE ISSUE IS TRUST. AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS BILL WILL BE OF MERIT WILL BE HELPFUL TO US NOT STIFLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT IT WILL HELP ACCOMMODATE THE POPULATION. GOALS THAT WE HAVE GOT TO FINISH HIGHER THAN I WILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALES. YES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TOO WANT TO EXTEND MY SUPPORT TO MY PROD CO AUTHOR OF SB NINE AND SPOKE WITH MANY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY IN LONG BEACH AND EVEN IN MY OWN HOME NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION IN TALKING AT LENGTH ABOUT THIS- THIS BILL AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM ABOUT THIS DOES TAKE A VERY GOOD BALANCE IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THERE IS. ADDITIONAL DENSITY JUST ONE MORE IN MANY CASES OFTEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OFF ALREADY ALLOW IT- AND ORDEAL OUT THREE- UNITS ON ONE LOT THIS ALLOWS JUST ONE MORE WITH MANY LOCAL PROVISIONS OWNER OCCUPATION AS WELL AND HISTORIC EXEMPTION WHICH I THINK IS A LOT OF WHAT ARE OUR HOME OWNER ASSOCIATIONS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THAT- I HOPE YOU CAN COME TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS ON ON HOUSING AND HOW WE CAN BUILD MORE. BUT ALSO PUSH THE ENVELOPE AS IT PERTAINS TO ENSURING THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LIVE IN A VERY AFFORDABLE HOMES SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT I THINK MY- COLLEAGUES FOR BEING A PART OF THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT THIS WORKING GROUP AND THE PRO TEMPER HER LEADERSHIP IN THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MR. A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR PLEASE. THE AUTHORS TOOK TO QUESTION YES I BELIEVE IN THE HOUSING COULD- A IS ASKED TIME BY THOSE PHONE IN AND WE GOT A ANSWER ON RECORD AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE FOR. HOMEOWNERS THE QUESTION OF BEING AN IMPORTANT ONE SINCE THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE REALLY BASED ON THE POPULATION THAT IS THERE IN TERMS OF MEETING THE COMMON AREA AND NEEDS AND THE OTHER- REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE IN IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE FEW MODIFICATION BECAUSE WE'RE IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES AND THOSE ARE ALL ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS SO. THERE IS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY'RE FIVE FAX HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ALL RIGHT IN IN. IN THE CASE OF- DENSIFICATION THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR- PROVISION. QUESTION IS DOES IT HAVE MORE FACILITY ASIAN. THANK YOU- MR PRESIDENT THROUGH THE CHAIR AT TO THE GOOD SAID FROM LAGOON GAL I KNOW THE INTER OF THE LAW THAT GOVERN COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS R. C. I. D.'S AND HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS HAVE ALWAYS GENERATED A LOT OF CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY- OUR OFFICE HAS CONSULTED WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL IN SP NINE WOULD NOT OVERRIDE C. ID OR H. AWAY RESTRICTIONS. I THINK THAT THANK YOU ALL FOR THAT ANSWER I THINK THAT THAT DOES RELIEVE A LOT OF CONCERN ON THE BILL OF MINE REMAINS OVER THE PARKING ISSUES AND I THINK I BRING IT UP ON EVERY. ONE OF THE HOUSING BILLS BECAUSE PARKING IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN SUBURBIA AND WHERE THERE IS A TRANSIT AVAILABLE PEOPLE HAVE CARS I THINK WE HAVE. A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE DOUBLING UP PIANO MANY OF THE RENTALS IN PARTICULAR YEAHAND WE STILL HAVE NO AUTHORITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO REULATE. PARKING WHEN IT IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE SO I'D I WILL REMAIN OPPOSED BUT I TRULY TRULY APPRECIATE OPERA THAMES. VERY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH ON THEIR FANS OF CONTINUING WORKING WITH THOSE ARE TWO I THINK RELIEVE THE CONCERN THAT'S THERE REGARDING COMMUNITY CHARACTER AND CERTAINLY. THE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THANK YOU. SO RUBIO. THANK YOU MUST PRESIDENT TODAY I ALSO RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHORED AS NINE AND I WANT TO COME THE PRO TEM FOR BEING SO THOUGHTFUL AND ALLOWING US TO HAVE A REALLY ROBUST IN DEPTH CONVERSATION OF WHAT'S NEEDED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT THIS BILL WAS BUILT BY CONSENSUS IT WAS A GROUP OF SENATORS THAT CAME TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. AND FOR ME PERSONALLY I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VOICE OF MY DISTRICT TO THE TABLE THEY WERE NOT ON BOARD BUT WE DID TAKE THEIR CONCERNS TO THE TABLE WE DISCUSSED THINGS AND WE WERE ABLE TO INVITE OTHERS LIKE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND EVERYONE THAT HAS A STAKE IN THIS ISSUE AND SO I COULD ONLY SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT ALL VOICES WERE HEARD ALL CONCERNS. WERE ADDRESSED AND WE'VE REALLY STRESSED TO CREATE A POLICY THAT GIVES EVERYONE SEVENTEEN SO I PERSONALLY ONE INCREASE-ALL OF US TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS WAS BUILT BY CONSENSUS AND IT BROUGHT EVERYONE TO THE TABLE SO WITH THAT I URGE AND I BUILT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WARNER. I THANK YOU MR- HI RIGHT AND SO OF ESPIONAGE I WANT TO THANK THE PROTON FOR HER- LEADERS AND FOR TAKE A VERY- AND MEASURED APPROACH TO- RESTRICTIVE ZONING- THIS IS A- BILL THAT WILL BE VERY IMPACTFUL OVERTIME AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES. WHEN HOUSING DEBATES ESPECIALLY AROUND ZONING PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE IMMEDIATE OVERNIGHT CHANGES AND THAT'S JUST NOT HOW- THE REAL WORLD AT HOUSING WORKS IS GOOD ABOUT GRADUAL. CHANGE OVER TIME- TO TRY TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE ABUNDANT HOUSING- SO THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE HERE SO THE PEOPLE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES. SO THAT OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS HAVE A SHOT OF ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO STAY HERE- THIS IS A VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL- PROPOSAL I WANT TO THANK OUR LEADER FOR HER. ON OUR WORK ON IT AND EVERYONE WHO HAS HELPED MOVE THIS FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL. THANK YOU. SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I WANT ALSO COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR THIS INCREDIBLE BUILT I THINK IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL AND AS WE ALL KNOW WE'RE FACING A IMMENSE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE- IN MY HOME DISTRICT IN ORANGE COUNTY- TOO MANY CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP THEY'RE GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE ANYWHERE CLOSE BY- THAT'S CREATED ALL SORTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE CONCERNS I'D CREATED CONGESTION. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATISTICS WE ALL KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA LOST POPULATION LAST YEAR THOSE WERE NOT RICH PEOPLE LEAVING THE STATE IT WAS- WORKING CLASS MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND IT LOOKS LIKE HOUSING AT A COST OF HOUSING HERE IN THE STATE WAS THE NUMBER ONE DRIVER WE WANT TO STAY COMPETITIVE AS AN ECONOMY WE NEED THOUGHTFUL MEASURES LIKE THIS AND THE MORE THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION MEASURES NOW THE LAST WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK TO EXTREME MEASURES GOING FORWARD SO I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK ANY FURTHER. OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. STATE SENATOR GROW YOUR MIKE UP. NO OKAY CENTER BACK AND WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I WILL QUICKLY CLOSE I- LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE COME OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE ZONING ISSUES IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF WORK- AND AGAIN A MONTH THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR HELPING US WITH THIS PRODUCT- AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK SAID THIS WAS A PROCESS. I WAS NOT ASKED TO RESPOND TO THIS QUESTION BUT I WILL- IN THE INTEREST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL AGENCIES AS IT RELATES TO PARKING HOT MAY REQUIRE ONE ALL STREET PARKING SPOT PER UNIT ACCEPTED THE PARCELS LOCATED WITHIN A HALF MILE WALKING DISTANCE OF HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT. SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I HAD THAT IN MY CLOTHES I WILL JUST COMMENT ON IS THE ISSUE AROUND VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AS SEVERITY ZONES I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THAT HAS COME UP IN THE CONVERSATION WITH COLLEAGUES AND. AS IT RELATES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL. SB NINE STAR ABOUT BETWEEN FARCE. AND NEED FOR A HOUSE IN THE STATE AND IT ALSO CONSIDERS LOCAL CONTROL. S. B. NINE GOES FURTHER THAN THE EXISTING EIGHTY YOU LOG ON FIRE SAFETY. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE A D. USE MUST BE MINISTER LEE PERMITTED. AND THAT LAW ALSO PROHIBITS- AS SOME OTHER LOCAL- REQUIREMENTS LIKE. REQUIRING SPRINKLERS IN AN EIGHTY YOU IF THERE ARE REQUIRED FOR THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE BUT THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE ABOUT THIS. S. B. NINE COPIES EXISTING LAW FOR THE BARN RIGHT WHICH IS A FORMER- PIECE OF LEGISLATION SB THIRTY FIVE. FROM OUR COLLEAGUE IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH SAYS THAT VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. ARE EXEMPT FROM THE BILL EXCEPT FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ALREADY ALLOWS FOR DEVELOPMENT SO WE PUT THAT BACK INTO. THE STANDARDS TO REDUCE COMBUSTIBLE COMBUSTIBLE EDDIE AND EMBER INTRUSION INTO HOMES. THE BOARD OF FORESTRY REGULATIONS FOR ROAD STANDARDS WATER SUPPLIES FOR FIREFIGHTING SIGNAGE FUEL BREAKS EXCEPT YOUR- DEFENSIBLE SPACE REGULATIONS. AND THE STANDARDS WOULD BE STRENGTHENED IF WETAKE UP ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION- S. B. TWELVE FROM A COLLEAGUE WHICH IS PENDING ON THE SENATE FLOOR THAT WOULD PROHIBIT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM APPROVING NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.

INDEED I AM HIS RESIDENT ID I AM. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON FILE ITEM ONE THREE THREE CALL THAT I READ I'M SORRY. SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY TWO BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AN ACT RELATING TO BAIL. INNER HURTS REPORTERS I'LL TAKE THE CALL ROLE- BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS MR PRESIDENT. I RISE TODAY. TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT FOR REFORM BUT MY JOINT AUTHOR FROM BERKELEY. MY BRILLIANT JOINT AUTHOR FROM BERKELEY AND MANY OF THE SENATORS HERE ON THIS FLOOR HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR MANY YEARS. THAT CAUSES BAIL REFORM. ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO A NUMBER OF US IN THIS CHAMBER AUTHORED AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BAIL REFORM MEASURE BASED UPON THE CONCLUSIONS THE ADVICE OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS PRE TRIAL REFORM GROUP IN FACT THE LADY TAKING THIS UP IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN ORDER TO GET THE COUNSELING ADVICE OF THOSE ESTEEMED JUDGES IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT MEASURE WAS SP TEN. IN ADVANCING SP TEN I STOOD ON THIS FLOOR WITH MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES. WITH EVERY OUNCE OF PASSION THAT I COULD MUSTER IT MADE THE CASE AS TO WHY WE NEED BAIL REFORM. THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM TURNS PEOPLE'S LIVES UPSIDE DOWN IN THE SYSTEM SYSTEMICALLY UNFAIR TO MANY TO SO MANY CALIFORNIANS THE REALITY THE CALIFORNIA UNREASONABLY HIGH BAIL AMOUNTS SERVICES THE FACTO PRE TRIAL IS DOWN RIGHT UNJUST. AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM COST TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITHOUT MAKING THEM ANY SAFER. THAT BILL PASSED OUT OF THIS CHAMBER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WITH TWENTY SIX VOTES. AND WAS SIGNED BY ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S BUT ONE OF OUR BAIL REFORMS MOST VOCAL CHAMPIONS. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WHAT FOLLOWED WAS THE REPEAL OF SB TEN BY THE VOTERS AFTER DECEPTIVE CAMPAIGN FUELED AND FINANCED LARGELY BY THE DEEP POCKETS OF THE BELL INDUSTRIES AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OR SHOULD SAY THE HEDGE FUNDS THAT OWN THE INSURANCE CARRIERS. HOWEVER I AM NOT HERE TO DWELL ON THAT OUTCOME. I RESPECT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IN THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR DIRECT DEMOCRACY. BUT HAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE INTRODUCED THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU TODAY S. B. TWO SIXTY. TWO ENTITLED THE SAFE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE IN REJECTING PROP TWENTY FIVE THE VOTERS WERE NOT SAYING I SUPPORT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM THEY WERE SAYING I DON'T SUPORT THIS APPROACH TO REFORMING THE BAIL MONEY SYSTEM. THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST PROP TWENTY FIVE WAS ABOUT. UNFAIR MONEY BAIL BUT LET ME BE CLEAR IT IS NEVER ASKED THE VOTERS TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT SYSTEM. WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD TO SHARPEN OUR PENCILS AND REFINERY APPROACH. AND LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT SOLUTION TO WHAT REMAINED A SYSTEMICALLY UNFAIR AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF BAIL. WESUCH A REFORM RATHER THAN REPLACE TO CREATE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WITHIN THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF BAIL WITHOUT RELYING ON ALGORITHMS A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS WHICH WERE THEFOCUS OF THE CAMPAIGN ON PROP TWENTY FIVE. WE WANTED TO BE A 100% SURE THAT OUR FRAMEWORK IN NO WAY RESEMBLED S. B. TEN. FOR GARDENS WE AGAIN LOOK TO THE COURTS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO ENSURE THAT OUR NEW APPROACH HAS BEEN VETTED BY THE COURTS THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTED THAT IT WORKED IT WAS PRACTICAL. AND WE ADOPTED A ZERO BAIL POLICY ENACTED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LAST SPRING. WE KNOW THIS APPROACH CAN WORK. OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIVE MONTHS THAT THE POLICY WAS IN PLACE JAIL POPULATIONS MEMBERS JAIL POPULATION STATEWIDE. DECLINED BY 30% WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT. NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON CRIME RATES IN MAJOR CALIFORNIA CITIES IN FACT. THIRTY ONE COUNTIES HAVE RETAINED THE ZERO BAIL POLICY IN SOME FORM. SINCE THEN THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY AND I INTRODUCED THIS BILL SEVERAL MONTHS AGO SOME TREMENDOUS THINGS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD OF BAIL REFORM IN LATE MARCH OUR CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT RULED IN THE CASE OF KENNETH HUMPHRIES A SIXTY SIX YEAR OLD MAN WHO STOLE SEVEN DOLLARS AND A BOTTLE OF COLOGNE WAS HELD IN CUSTODY WITH BAIL SET AT AUST ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO AFFORD. IN ITS DECISION THE SUPREME COURT CONCLUDED QUOTE THE COMMON PRACTICE OF CONDITIONING FREEDOM SOLELY ON WHETHER AN ARRESTEE CAN AFFORD. BAIL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL I REPEAT THE SUPREME COURT SAID THE COMMON PRACTICE OF CONDITIONING FREEDOM SOLELY ON WHETHER AN ARREST YOU COULD AFFORD BAIL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE RULE THIS THAT THEY MUST CONSIDER THE ABILITIES OF THE ARRESTEES ABILITY TO PAY IN SETTING BAIL. SO THE BOTTOM LINE MEMBERS IS DESPITE ALL THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN ON THIS FLOOR IN THE OTHER CHAMBER AND HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN LITIGATED AND ADJUDICATED THE FIGHT OVER THE LEGALITY OF THE CURRENT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IS OVER. IT IS OVER. AND I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY SHARE WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS CHAMBER. A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT THE COURT MADE BECAUSE THOSE THE PRECISE TO THE POINT THAT ME AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO SUPPORTED THIS MEASURE MADE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NOW THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A SUPREME COURT DECISION. THE CONSEQUENCES OF PRE TRIAL DETENTION ARE ON ARRESTEES THEY SAID ON THEIR LIVES OR MENTION PROFOUND BECAUSE IT HEIGHTENS THE RISK OF LOSING A JOB. A HOME IN CUSTODY OF A CHILD. THE CURRENT SYSTEM THEY SAID FORCES THE STATE TO BEAR COSTS OF FEEDING AND HOUSING ARRESTEES THE COULD BE PROPERLY RELEASED THEY SAID. PART OF THE DISPARITY BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S HYPE A PRE DETENTION. RATE AND OTHER STATES MAY ARISE FROM THE FACT THAT EVEN WHEN THE BAYLESS TECHNICALLY ALLOWED THE AMOUNT THAT MUST BE POSTED IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER. IN CALIFORNIA ON AVERAGE THAN ELSEWHERE THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE MADE. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT IS THE LAW THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE HUMPHREY'S DECISION WAS OUR SUPREME COURT STATEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ON PRE TRIAL JUSTICE. AND THIS MEASURE S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO PROVIDES A CLEAR AND EFFECTIVE BLUEPRINT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ALLEY OF THE CURRENT MONEY BAIL STRUCTURE. WE NEED A BLUEPRINT AND S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO IS THAT BLUEPRINT. IT IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE THAT MAKES CRITICAL REFORMS TO THE EXISTING BILL FRAMEWORK USING STATED PRINCIPLES INVENTED POLICIES OF THE SUPREME COURT. AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HERE'S WHAT IT DOES IN ESSENCE FIRST IT LEVELS THE PRE TRIAL PLAYING FIELD BY SETTING BAIL AT ZERO DOLLARS FOR MISDEMEANORS AND LOW LEVEL FELONIES. WITHOUT ALLOWING REPEAT OFFENDERS TO GAME THE SYSTEM SECOND. IT ENSURES THAT THE ACCUSED DO NOT ASSUME ANY COSTS OF COURT IMPOSED REACH. CONDITION REALLY. THREE REQUIRES BELL COMPANIES TO REFUND THE PREMIUMS THEY RECEIVE FOR PEOPLE. WERE ARRESTED BUT ARE CHARGED BUT WHO HAVE THEIR CASES DISMISSED REMAKE ALL OF THEIR COURT APPEARANCES. THE CURRENT BAIL SYSTEM BASICALLY THEY CHARGE UP FRONT YOU DON'T GET CHARGED A YEAR THEY THEY GET YOU OUT OF JAIL THEY DON'T GET CHARGED. YOU STILL LOSE YOUR MONEY COMPLETELY UNFAIR SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE LAW. AND BY CODIFYING THE OPERATIVE LANGUAGE HUMPHRIES MUCH OF WHICH I JUST QUOTED. IT FROM THE SUPREME COURT S. P. TWO SIXTEEN TO INSURERS THAT WHERE BAIL IS APPROPRIATE. COURTS DON'T SEE IT. HIGHER SAID IT HIGHER THAN WHAT THE ACCUSED CAN REASONABLY AFFORD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO IMPLEMENTS THE HOPPER DECISION IMPLEMENTS ADDITIONAL COUNCIL ZERO BILL POLICY WHICH HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD. AND PROHIBITS THE UNFAIR USER YES AND PREDATORY PRACTICES THE BILL IS FOR HIS ENGAGING FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW THAT IT'S YOU KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN ISSUES ON THE HUMAN TRACK I'M ON ON THE- ZERO BAIL HATE CRIMES HUMAN TRAFFICKING CHILD ABUSE ELDER ABUSE. ASSAULT WITH FORCE TO CALL GREAT BODILY INJURIES BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THERE'S A FEW OTHER ONES AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM. AND POSSESSING A GUN NEAR SCHOOL. WE CLEARLY WILL DEAL WITH THOSE EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE DEALT WITH THE REVOLVING DOOR ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THIS THING. AND I'VE GOTTA SAY IN JUST THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF MONEY BAIL IS OBSOLETE. IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN IT COST US MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITHOUT KEEPING US ANY SAFER. AND WE HAVE DATA FROM JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTY QUEST THE STATE. INCLUDING RIGHT HERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY EXCUSE ME RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT SIMPLE TEXTING MESSAGES TO FOLKS. CAN INSURE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THEIR COURT DATES PEOPLE NOT LEAVING TO GO. TO AN ISLAND OR SOMEPLACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREATY THEY'RE DEALING WITH THEIR FAMILY ISSUES ALL THE KINDS OF THINGS THE COURT JUST TALKED ABOUT. AND THEY JUST SIMPLY IS SIMPLY REMIND UNDER THE SIMPLE. MEMBERS I THINK YOU KNOW ME TO WELL I HAVE DONE MY HOMEWORK. THE BUDGET CHAIR HAS DONE HER HOMEWORK THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO'VE BEEN PART OF THIS COALITION AND THE OTHER COALITION OF. FOLKS INCLUDING DIANNE GRIFFITHS WHO'S USED TO BE WORK WORKS WITH THE PROTEST NEEDS TO WORK WITH ME AND OTHERS AS USUAL COUNTS AND OTHERS. HAVE WORKED THEIR HEART OUT. DEALING WITH THE DETAILS AND FEELINGS OF DOING THEIR HOMEWORK TO GET THIS ISSUE RIGHT. FOR YEARS WE'VE ALL WORKED TOGETHER ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUES AND IMMERSED OURSELVES IN THE DETAILS THE FRAMEWORK WE PROPOSE WORKS. THERE'S GOING TO BE A FEW CHANGES THAT WILL SEE HOPEFULLY THE OTHER HOUSE BUT IT IS FAIR IT'S JUST AND WE MUST ACT NOW. TO PUT THE BLUEPRINT TOGETHER OF WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAID WHEN THEY SAID THAT THE CURRENT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL I ASK THE ARRIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR. SENATOR NELSON. THIS PRESIDENT JOAN OF THE CENTER I RISE IN OPPOSITION. S. CHAMBERTHE WATER PRISON TERMS I GOT TO SEE THE MERITS OF THE BAIL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. IT DOES ENSURE JUSTICE IT DOES ENSURE JUSTICE FOR SOCIETY LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT JUST A BIT. BAIL SCHEDULES ARE SET AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT'S AN ACCOUNTABILITY FACTOR. MOST ASSUREDLY DALE ENSURES THAT THE CONVICTED. OR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT NOT THE CONVICTED WITHIN YOUR CUES WILL THEN DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE YOU SHOW UP IN COURT. I DON'T AGREE THAT EVERYBODY WILL JUST SHOW UP. THE RECORD DOESN'T REALLY SUPPORT THAT. MANY SKIPPED BAIL. BAIL IS A VERY USEFUL TOOL. AND THEN YOU HAD ANOTHER WAY. SEAN THE MONUMENT. I GO. THEY'RE VALUABLE ADJUNCT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT DO I NEED. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW. DOES NOT HAVE THE REACH TO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES. THE CHANGE BAIL JUMPERS. BONDSMEN ARE THEN AN EXTRA ARM FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THE CITIZENS PROTECTION FOR THE INSURANCE AT THE INS SERVICE RIGHT THE JUSTICE OF THE SYSTEM OF THE SYSTEM. WHEN A CRIMINAL HAS A GREEN SUN CITIZEN BE THAT A RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY. OUR MURDER RATE YOUR NAME. THIS IS A DISCIPLINE TO ENSURE THAT THE- ACCUSED IS GOING TO SHOW UP FOR JUST THE SEARCH. AND THAT'S NOT ABOUT ENRICHING ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY THAT IS ABOUT INSURING. THE COMFORT IN THE PEACE. OF JUSTICE. CORRECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA. NOW IF LAST YEAR'S BILL WAS SO PERFECT. THEN WHY DID WE HAVE TO THEN. WAIT FOR A SUPREME COURT DECISION TO CORRECT THE COURSEAS THIS BILL PURPORTS TO DO. I WOULD SUBMIT IT PROBABLY MAKES IT BETTER LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD THROW OUT. DALE THIS IS MAYBE A BIT OF A COMPROMISE BY THE PROPONENTS HOLD THE WORST CRIMES. FOLKS WERE LEFT IN THE LEFT WORST CRIMINALS OUT OF PRISON TODAY. AND THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WE'LL GET TO THAT ANOTHER MATTER ANOTHER DEBATE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR US TO RETAIN THE DISH ONE OF BAIL THAT HAS WORKED WELL FOR MANY DECADES. WHO DID IT NOT WORK OUT WELL FOR. WELL IT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO HOT FOR THE ACCUSED. WHO WANTED TO RUN. LET'S GET BAIL AND NOT FACE JUSTICE. KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IS NOT JUST THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT IS ALSO AN ASPECT A PUBLIC SAFETY IN A CHURCH THAT THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT HOLD THEIR JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS. BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS SHOW UP IN COURT. AND IN NO SMALL MEASURE BECAUSE- THE BAIL BONDS. PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK. TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE I URGE A NO VOTE. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. I AM THE WE USED TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR BEST B. TWO SIXTY TWO I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THINGS SIMPLY BUT NOT INACCURATELY AND MY YEARS ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO PARSE. THE LAW. TWO IN A WAY BECAUSE WHEN I WOULD HEAR VARIOUS TESTIMONY AND NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT I HAD TO SPEND HOURS. REALLY TRYING TO WORK WITH FOLKS TO HELP ME BREAK IT DOWN AND UNDERSTANDING SO LET ME TELL YOU IN MY SIMPLE WORDS. THAT WE HAVE A SITUATION NOW. BECAUSE OF MONEY BAIL IF YOU CAN PAY BAIL. YOU GET OUT OF JAIL. BUT IF YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE NO CHOICE AND YOU HAVE TO STAY THERE. AND THAT WILL TEST FOR FREEDOM. MEANS THAT THOSE WHO ARE FORCED TO WAIT IN JAIL FACE A SITUATION WHERE THEIR CHILDREN. OR LOVED ONES CAN BE REMOVED pTHEIR JOBS. THEY CAN LOSE THAT WHERE THEY LIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE SITTING IN JAIL MAYBE THEY DIDN'T PAY RENT. I REMEMBER TESTIMONY ONCE IN A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WHERE THERE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN JAIL FOR SIX YEARS AWAITING. A COURT CASE TO SEE WHETHER THEY WERE. INNOCENT OR GUILTY SIX YEARS DO YOU KNOW THE IMPLICATIONS ARE MORE. IF YOU'RE REMOVING YOUR HOME FOR SIX YEARS. NOW THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT THESE ALL HAPPEN BEFORE THERE IS A DETERMINATION OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE. SO YES YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF THE CRIME BUT YOU'VE NOT YET BEEN. AT THE COURT HAS NOT YET RULED YOU CONVICTED. WELL S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO DOES NOT ELIMINATE MONEY BAIL FORTUNATELY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN RULING WHEN THE HUMPHREY DECISION GAVE US SOME GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWED US TO EMBODY THAT IN THIS BILL IN SP TWO SIXTY TWO AND ESSENTIALLY SP TWO SIXTY TWO ALLOWS THOSE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PAY TO RECEIVE THE SAME JUSTICE AS SOMEONE WHO. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR MEANT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO. ECHO THAT AND THANK THE AUTHORS FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND- FROM BERKELEY FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL IN ADDRESSING IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE I WANT TO PARTICULARLY COMMEND THEM. FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS WAS A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH FROM EXEMPTING VIOLENT CRIMES HUMAN TRAFFICKING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND IMPORTANTLY DURING THIS TIME HATE CRIMES I HATE CRIMES ARE AS WE KNOW ALL OUR ACCELERATING AT A RAPID RATE INCLUDING IN MY HOME DISTRICT IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF CRIMES- THAT WE TREAT THEM MORE SERIOUSLY AND I JUST WANTED TO AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THAT AMENDMENT HIRES MICHAEL. THANK YOU SENATOR I CALL SKI. MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO SIXTY TWO I WASN'T GOING TO- SPEAK ON IT BUT I- IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS AUTHORED AND NICK IN THE CONCERNED THE PERCEPTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS- I BELIEVE I COMMEND THE AUTHORS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE HUMPHREY CASE WHICH I HAD THE PLEASURE OF READING. REALLY PLACES A DUTY UPON THIS LEGISLATURE TO DO SOMETHING TO RESPOND TO THAT THE FINDINGS AT THE HEAD AS HE- THE SENATOR FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SAID IN THIS COMMON PRACTICE IS COMMON PRACTICE OF HAVING. LOCAL COURTS SET THE BAIL BAIL SCHEDULE THE YOU KNOW THOSE OF US WHO PRACTICE A LITTLE BIT IN THE CRIMINALLAW ARENA SO MANY TEACHERS JUDGES DON'T EVEN CONSIDER. THE TIES THAT THE PERSON HAS THE COMMUNITY THEY SIMPLY LOOKAT THE BAIL SCHEDULE ON SAY BOOM YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THIS AND THE- THE- THE HUMPHREY'S DECISION CLEARLY SAYS THAT THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WE CAN'T JUST. SIT HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY. OKAY WHAT DO WE DO WHAT WE DO NOW. THE AUTHORS AT THE IS IT ELOQUENTLY OF SPACE SPOKEN. CAREFULLY LOOKED AT THE HUMPHREY'S DECISION AND IS IMPLEMENTED THIS END THE PROVISIONS THAT THEY GIVE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL EACH YEAR GO OVER AND SET WE STARTED ZERO FOLKS. THE WHOLE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS IT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO START AT ZERO ON ON THE BELT AND THEN IF WE HAVE THESE. THE FACTS ARE GOING TO DETERMINE IF THEY'RE DANGEROUS ENOUGH THE RELEASING OF THE COMMUNITY. WARRANTS S. R. I. SCHEDULE THEN WE'RE GONNA LOOK IT OVER A BILL THEN WE CAN LOOK AT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY SO I AM ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS THE- THE- THE- CALL TO DUTY R. PONDRE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN LISTENED TO BY THE MAJORITY LEADER. AND I- VIRGIN I'VE- THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. EARNINGS SEEN NINE. AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL RIGHT ALL I'M SURE I'M SURE I'M SORRY CENTERBRIDGE BIRD PLEASE NOTE FOR THE CLOSE I JUST INSPIRED BY THE COMMENT THAT. BY THE SENATOR FROM FREMONT JUST MADE ABOUT OUR DUTY. I THINK YOU HIT IT ON THE ON THE HEAD. WITH THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE CURRENT BILL STRUCTURE WE STILL HAVE BAIL. IT REALLY IS AS MY JOINT OFFER INDICATED THE ABILITY TO PAY. SO INSTEAD OF HAVING THESE ARBITRARY. NUMBERS IT DOESN'T LOOK AS THE PERSON IN THE I. AS IF BEING. A JUDGE THERE CERTAIN. SO CAN DO TO THEIR FLIGHT RISK AND THEIR PUBLIC RISK. INSTEAD OF JUST HAVE A PRICE LIST FOR YOUR LIVER. ITS BASE SAYS THAT THE ESSENCE OF OUR CONSTITUTION IS ABOUT YOU GOT TO TREAT PEOPLE AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND YOU CAN'T ARBITRARILY SET NUMBERS AND SET A BAIL SCHEDULE THAT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS. IT DOESN'T WORK SECONDLY WHAT WE KNOW BY VIRTUE WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ISN'T ALTERNATIVES WORK. THE I WANT TO RESPECT THE POINT- FROM THE CENTER IN THE NORTH OR VALOR AWARDS WHICH CITY IT IS FROM. NIELSEN R. R. DEAN I SHOULD SAY. YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM HAS INVOLVED THE OWN MY DAD KNEW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HEARD THIS WAS AN OLD JAILHOUSE LAWYER IN THE FORTIES IN LOS ANGELES. YOU GIVE A HUNDRED DOLLARS THE CLERK MAJOR YOU MAY BACK TO COURT AND YOU GOT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BACK IF YOU WANTED THAT SCENE OUT. IT EVOLVED AND MORPHED INTO A BUSINESS THAT IS OWNED BY HEDGE FUNDS. BECAUSE IT'S SO PROFITABLE. THE FRONT LINE. AGENTS THAT BAIL AGENTS THOSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OFTEN DOING THE WORK AND PROBABLY AREN'T MAKING VERY MUCH MONEY. IT'S THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE MAKING THE MONEY. BECAUSE THEY SAW. THAT THERE'S THIS QUIRK IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THEM TO JUST PRINT MONEY IS ONE COMPANY THAT WE FOUND IN A REPORT. THAT HADN'T PAID A BILL CLAIM IN SEVENTEEN YEARS. BETTER THE DRUG BUSINESS. YOU NEVER KNOW ALL THE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THE ROACH MOTEL MONEY GOES AND NOTHING COMES OUT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED SO NOW WE HAVE DATA. WE HAVE A SUPREME COURT GUIDANCE. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THE CENTER FOR FREMONT SAID. AS A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT. AND PUTTING TOGETHER A BLUEPRINT THAT'S OUR DUTY. TO BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A SYSTEM THAT EMBODIES THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT THEY DISCUSSED. THAT EMBODIES THE LINE THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED AS A RESULT OF BAIL REFORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND PUTTING TOGETHER A SYSTEM THAT'S FAIR THAT'S JUST FOR EVERYBODY. THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC COST THE PUBLIC LESS MONEY. AND THAT WORKS IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW'S THE TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS. THANK YOU.

DINNER'S DINNER FOR GEORGE THANK YOU SO MUCH MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS FOR THE PAST YEAR I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON A STATEWIDE COMMITTEE. ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE AND MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE INCLUDED UC IRVINE LAW SCHOOL DEAN SONG RICHARDSON GOVERNOR PETE WILSON'S- APPOINTED JUSTICE JUSTICE KARL MARINO AND RETIRED SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE PETER ESPINOZA. S. B. EIGHTY ONE THE BILL I'M PRESENTING NOW IS THE PRODUCT OF THAT COMMITTEE AND IT WAS CONSTRUCTED PRIMARILY BY THE JUDGES. ARE IN THAT A BODY WHO BASE THEIR EXPERIENCE. WHILE THEY WERE ON THE BENCH DEALING WITH CALIFORNIA'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS. S. B. EIGHTY ONE DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT INSTEAD ITS APPROACHES TO ESTABLISH CLEAR GUIDANCE. ON THE APPLICATION OF SENSE AND HENCE MINTS WHILE RETAINING JUDGES AUTHORITY TO APPLY AN ENHANCEMENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. SO WHILE THE CENTENNIALS MINTS ON THEIR FACE MAY SEEM STRAIGHTFORWARD THE RESEARCH REVIEWED BY OUR COMMITTEE AND THE STAKEHOLDER TESTIMONY RECEIVED EXPOSED VERY DEEP INCONSISTENCIES IN THEIR APPLICATION. WHERE THE SAME BASIC CRIME ONE PERSON MAY HAVE GOTTEN NO SENSE ENHANCEMENTS ANOTHER MAY HAVE GOTTEN THREE. SO DUE TO THE LACK OF CLEAR GUIDANCE ON HOW TO APPLY THE ENHANCEMENTS AND WHAT BASIS TO DISMISS THEM. S. B. EIGHTY ONE IS DESIGNED TO HELP REDUCE THOSE AND THE BILL AS I MENTIONED IS BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE AND INSIGHT. OF THOSE JUDGES TO HELP PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDANCE AND RETAIN JUDICIAL AUTHORITY AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU ANY DESCRIPTION OF IT ON THE SIDE OF SENATOR NELSON. BUT A PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I. URGE A NO VOTE- THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. REPEATEDLY THROUGH THE INITIATIVE. AND UNDERSTAND- THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL THOSE VERY SACRED TRUSTS AND AUTHORITIES OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE UNDER ATTACK NOW. FROM MANY QUARTERS. PEOPLE WANT TO DENY. THE DIRECT DEMOCRACY THAT WE ENJOY NOW. BACK TO THE ISSUE. I'VE ENHANCEMENTS OVER THE DECADES THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE WAYS WE HAVE ENSURED JUSTICE. PHIL IF YOU ELIMINATE THE ENHANCEMENT YOU'RE STILL MAKE A LOT OF THE THING DIDN'T HAPPEN. THE USER OF THE GUN WELL THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THE BURGLARY ROBBERY YEAH THAT HAPPENED BUT THESE OTHERS DIDN'T- THE ABSURD EXCUSES BEEN USED IN THE PAST THAT THIS IS STACKING. STAFFING WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU DO IT OR DID YOU NOT THE JURY CONVICTED YOU. GET IT. SO WHAT IS IN THE RECORD IT HAS BEEN TO ENSURE JUSTICE. AND THAT THEY'LL BE PROGRESSIVE. CONSEQUENCES SHOULD SURE PROGRESSIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CONTINUED CRIMINALITY OR FOR MULTIPLE OFFENSES THAT OCCUR. SO YOU HAVE ORIGINAL ROBBERY. WELL ONE OF THOSE DIDN'T COUNT. WHAT I GONNA ENHANCE. WE'RE GONNA STOP SENTENCE OH NO. JUST ONE. NO I'M NOT GOING TO BUY THIS. ARGUMENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. THERE IS AN OUTCRY RUSH IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN ANOTHER STAGE TO DESTROY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. MAKE IT A FREE FOR ALL WORLD. BOY I LOOK AT TOSE BIG CITIES WHO HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. HAMPERED THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS BUT AFTER WORKING OUT WELL ISN'T IT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. DO YOU NEED ANY GREATER TESTIMONY DID YOU SET THE VICTIMS RATHER THAN. CRIMINALS WERE GONNA. BEING CRIMINALS BECAUSE OF THIS. THIS GREAT RUSH THE DESTROYED JUSTICE AND PUT HANDCUFFS. ON ONE PORTION OF. WELL WE TAKE THE HANDCUFFS OFF THE CRIMINALS THE STATE NOW EIGHT THOUSAND MORE. THE WORST OF THE WORST. ARE GOING TO BE LET GO INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. DO YOU HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. BUT THEY WILL HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED IN CUSTODY SUFFICIENTLY NOT TO GO BACK. TO THEIR OLD HABITS DIE HARD. A GOOD PROGRESSION. CONSEQUENCES OF WATER NEEDED YOU DO THAT WITH YOUR OWN CHILDREN. IF THEY KEEP DOING SOME THINGS THAT GET DENIED SOME MORE PRIVILEGES. IT'S LOGICAL IT'S HUMAN NATURE. AND IT'S JUST AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS BILL DIMINISHING JUSTICE. ASSUMING THAT THIS OTHER ACTIVITY THE CARD DID NOT HAPPEN. SO WE'RE NOT GONNA STACKED SENTENCES. OVER GOING TO A SHOW THEY ALREADY SERVED THEIR TIME. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST BILLS AND ALL OF THIS ASSAULT. ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I URGE A NO VOTE. AND AT LEAST KEEP THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO A DEGREE IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE VOTED FOR IT REPEATEDLY. THESE ENHANCEMENTS. SENATOR FORGERS. MR PRESIDENT IF I MAY I POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR ISSUE LOOKS AT SINNERS CAN WERE YOU ACCEPTED YES. WITH YOUR- THANK YOU- WOULD YOU BE ABLETO HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND OR EXPLAIN. HOWTHE APPLICATION OF THE ENHANCEMENT- PARTICULAR TO ME THE- CIRCUMSTANCE FOR DISMISSAL WOULD INCLUDE APPLICATION THE ENHANCEMENT IF IT WOULD RESULT IN A DISPARATE RACIAL IMPACT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. IS IT A PROPORTIONAL. RACIAL IMPACT OR IS A BY THE NUMBERS IT IS ALL IT IS GUIDANCE TO THE- JUDGE THE JUDGE DOES NOT HAVE TO USE- HAVE SOME NUMBERS NEXT TO HIM OR HER INDICATING WHEN THEY HAVE OR HAVEN'T- ISSUE THE ENHANCEMENT. OF BUT RATHER WOULD THEY APPLY IT'S PURELY GUIDANCE THAT IN THAT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE YES. THE DEFENDANTS WERE A- NO MATTER- ANY RACE NO MATTER WHICH RACE WOULD THEY APPLY THIS ENHANCEMENT REGARDLESS SO IN OTHER WORDS CAMPAIGN WHICH THEY JUSTIFY IT FROM A OLOR BLIND POINT OF VIEW AND IT IS NOT. IN ANY WAY- ARE REQUIRED THEM TO LOOK AT OKAY HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I APPLIE THIS IN THE PAST NO IT IS PURELY IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD I APPLY THIS. IN A COLOR BLIND MANNER. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATOR BACKER. I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE AND I'LL SAY SOMETHING THAT I MAY REPEAT IN IN SUBSEQUENT DEBATES HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WILL DEAL WITH ENHANCEMENTS. AND WHEN YOU MAKE A GENERAL STATEMENT WHICH IS. TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE DATA AND THE FACTS OF OUR SENTENCING. I'LL SAY TO STATS IN PARTICULAR. FIRSTLY THAT TEXAS KNOWN AS A TOUGH ON CRIME STATE I THINK WE ALL AGREE HAS TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES. WE HAVE THIRTY TO FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MISSISSIPPI NOT ALSO KNOWN PROGRESSIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATE IS SECOND IN PROPORTION OF LIFE SENTENCES IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. THEY HAVE 10% OF THE PRISONERS SERVING LIFE SENTENCES WE HAVE 30% SERVING LIFE SENTENCES. ENHANCEMENTS ARE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AND I APPRECIATE THEOFFER TACKLING THESE DIFFICULT- SUBJECTS. BUT THESE ARE THE KINDS OF REFORMS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A SPECIAL REQUEST NIVEAU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. IN NINETEEN NINE CENTERS CAN OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH- MR PRESIDENT SO CONTRARY TO IT ONE FLOOR COMMENT S. B. EIGHTY ONE DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY OF CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING ENHANCEMENTS. AND ADDITIONALLY NO PART OF S. B. EIGHTY ONE IS RETROACTIVE THOSE CRRENTLY SERVING TIME CANNOT CONDITION TO BE RESENTENCED SP ONE EIGHTY ONE CONTAINS NO PROVISION FOR RESENTENCING IT ONLY APPLIES GOING FORWARD.

AND RUBIO FOR GEORGE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT S. V. EIGHT OH FIVE WHICH WILL CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP THE NON PROFITS SMALL PERFORMING ARTS ORGANIZATION STAY AFLOAT. THIS BILL IS A LIFELINE TO SO MANY OF THOSE SMALL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE STRUGGLING DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE PANDEMIC. THESE ORGANIZATIONS RELY ON FUND RAISING AND THEIR PERFORMANCES AND THIS PAST YEAR THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO EITHER. THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE HEART OF SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED AND ALSO HELP THE SURROUNDING BUSINESSES MAKE ENDS MEET. SB EIGHT OH FIVE WILL HELP THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND ENSURE THAT THE ARTISTS ARE TAKING CARE OF WITH PROPER WAGES IMPROPER BENEFITS. S. B. EIGHT OH FIVE IS ABOUT EQUITY IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE IN ABOUT AXIS IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE THE ARTS. AS A PARLIAMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER I CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THE PARTS ARE DISAPPEARING EVERY DAY IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THE ARTS CONTINUE TO BE A STRONG PARTNER TO THESE SCHOOLS THAT CANNOT PROVIDE FOR EXPOSURE. AND I HAVE SEEN THESE THEATER IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE PARTNERSHIPS SUCH AS WRITING CLASSES IF THEY PROVIDE FREE TICKETS NOT ONLY FOR THE STUDENTS BUT FOR THEIR PARENTS SO THAT THEY CAN ALL ENJOY THE ARTS AS A FAMILY. THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALSO IN COMPUTERS WERE THE VOICES CAN BE HEARD. A LOT OF THESE PERFORMERS DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THEIR CRAFT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT WEALTHY OR WELL CONNECTED TO THE INDUSTRY SO THESE SMALL NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE THAT STEPPING STONE THEY NEED. TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED AND FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS I ALSO WANT TO REMIND US OF THE ROLE THAT SMALL PERFORMING ARTS HAVE PLAYED IN HISTORY. FROM THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGETTE SUFFRAGE WHERE WOMEN ENGAGE AFFLUENT. FEMALES FROM FROM DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO JOIN THEIR CALLS. TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WHERE STRONG IMAGERY PETER SPOKEN WORD. WAS USED TO CONVEY THEIR MESSAGE. TO THE AFTER CAMPESINO WHICH WAS A SMALL THEATER THAT GREW IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO CONVEY SOME OF THE INJUSTICES OF THE FARM WORKER WERE EXPERIENCING. AND HELPED ORGANIZE AND GET BETTER WAGES AND SUPPORT. FOR THE FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS. CAN'T I ALSO WANT TO CONVEY THAT THESE COMMUNITY THEATERS WHEN THEY CLOSE THEY JUST DON'T CLOSE BUT THE CLOTHES SO MANY DREAMS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE INNER CITY COMMUNITIES WHICH I HAPPEN TO BE PART OF.
