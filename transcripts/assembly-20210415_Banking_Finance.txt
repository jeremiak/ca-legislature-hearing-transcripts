WITH SO MANY CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF COVER NINETEEN IT IS IMPORTANT THERE ARE STRONG PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT WELL INTENDED. BUT MISINFORMED CONSUMERS FROM FALLING INTO WORST FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. CURRENTLY THERE'S VERY LITTLE REGULATION OF DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REFLECT THE CHANGING PRACTICES OF THIS INDUSTRY. WHICH IS MADE ENFORCEMENT MORE DIFFICULT. THIS LACK OF REGULATION HAS LED TO INCREASED PREDATORY BEHAVIOR BY SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS WITHIN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY AND I WILL SAY I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS AND THAT SOMEONE INDUSTRY- WHO I THINK DO HELP PEOPLE IN TIMES OF NEED TO GET. MORE FINANCIALLY SECURE BUT THIS BILL IS REALLY AIMED AT TIGHTENING UP- SOME OF THE REGULATION. CHARTING SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS IN THE SPACE. MOREOVER THE LACK OF REGULATION OF THIS GROWING INDUSTRY HAS RESULTED IN CONUSED AND FRUSTRATED CUSTOMERS SPENDING ADDITIONAL MONEY AND TIME TRYING TO DEAL WITH UNANTICIPATED DEBT COLLECTIONS. LAWSUITS OF THEIR IN ROLE DEBTS. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL MODERNIZE CURRENT LAW TO BETTER REFLECT THE INDUSTRY'S PRACTICES AND IMPROVE REGULATION OF DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES BY DOING THE FOLLOWING THINGS. MAKING SURE THAT ALL THAT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES OPERATING CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED BY CALIFORNIA LAW. PROHIBITING THAT SOME COMPANIES FROM ENGAGING IN DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING PRACTICES. REQUIRING CRITICAL DISCLOSURES THAT WOULD ALLOW CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL OPTIONS. AND PROVIDING CUSTOMERS- INJURED BY BAD ACTORS WITH REMEDIES. THIS IS AN URGENT THERE'S AN URGENT NEED FOR THIS- LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO PROVIDE GUARDRAILS OVER THAT SOME INDUSTRY BEFORE THE BAD ACTORS IN THE SPACE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS. WHO HAVE ALREADY ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND THE RECESSION THIS BILLS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS IN THE SUPPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE DF PI. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT THE D. F. P. I. HAS A BROAD MANDATE TO REGULATE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS UNDER CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL LAWS-INCLUDING THE REGULATION OF THAT SETTLEMENT SERVICES. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL SUPPLEMENT THE FBI'S PURVIEW OVER THAT SOME COMPANIES WILL PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH MORE ROBUST PROTECTIONS IN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY WILL ADDRESS TWO OF THE MAIN CONCERNS TWO OF THE THREE- THAT OPPOSITION HAS RAISED AND IT WILL BE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS- AN ONGOING FASHION DOES THE OPPOSITION KNOWS- THE REMAINING ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE SOME OF WHICH I. AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN COME TO AGREEMENT ON. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION- AND SUPPORTED BY NUMBER OF LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSUMER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT WITH ME TODAY ARE DESIREE WENT NORTH. THE CONSUMER SHEET SORRY SHE'S FROM THE- CONSUMER ADVOCACY PROJECTS.

THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRIN NUMBERS. I ENJOY WHEN PAR AND YOU'VE HEARD MY TITLE WHICH IS VERY VERY LONG. YEAH THE PRACTICE WHEREBY A DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANY INTERJECTED BETWEEN HUMOR AND CREDITOR WITH THE GOAL OF NEGOTIATING A SETTLEMENT OF THE CONSUMERS THAT. PRESUMABLY BUT NOT ALWAYS FOR NOT LESS THAN WHAT IS OWED. I DEFINITELY CAN OPERATE BY CONSUMER AND GOING TO GET PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE NEGOTIATED AND PAYING A MONTHLY FEE INTERNET COUNT IN ORDER TO FIND THE RESULTANT SETTLEMENT CONSERVANCY. BUT THAT'S THE ONLY COMPANY THAT TOP PAYMENT ON THE CONSUMER DEBT IN ORDER TO FORCE THE CREDITOR INTO NEGOTIATING SETTLEMENT. AT THE OUTSET OF THE PLAN AND WHAT THE TERM IF YOU WHICH CREDIT RATING TAKE A LARGE HIT BECAUSE THE COMPUTER DOESN'T CURRENTLY DEALING WITH AND EVENTUALLY TURNED OUT THAT. NOTHING THAT I'VE DESCRIBED IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO DOCUMENT COMPANIES CONSUMERS CAN DO ALL OF THIS CELL TRICKERY. WHEN IT COMES TO CONSUMER DATA THE MARKET PLACE FAILURE IN THE FEDERAL LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON CREDITORS WORKING WITH THEIR DESTRUCTION YOU MIGHT. GET ONE THAT DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS. THE FAILURE IT EXPLOITS THAT. IN A ABSOLUTELY. THAT CONSUMERS OPTION TO DEAL WITH THEIR- SAID TO UNDER. THE OPTION LIKE HOW TO NO CHOICE ALL. CONFUSION ABOUT THAT AND- THAT GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY THE- ISSUE. I GRADING OF THAT IS THE OPPOSITE TO THE AMERICANS THAT THE- OF FOR THAT. THE REASON DEFENSE. I THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE CONNECTS. BECAUSE I THINK INCOME COMPOSED WEEKLY. AND CONSTRUCTION. THAT WOULD NOT FLEXIBLE AND THERE WILL TO HAND IT OVER LIKE YOUR- PLAN. AND MIKE. BUSINESSES MAY COMES UP COSTA CITIZEN CENTER FOR GOING MEDICATION OR WHO. IN ORDER TO STAY IN UNNECESSARY TO HELP. IN NOT THAT COMING COMPANIES ARE BY THAT REGULATION AND DOT. IS ACTIVELY TO.

AB FORTINO FIVE IS NOT A BAN ON THAT SETTLEMENT CONTRARY TO THE OPPOSITION'S COMES BACK CLEAN. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL NOT RUN DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES OUT OF CALIFORNIA AS PROVED BY. THE FACT THAT THEIR SERVICES ARE STILL OFFERED IN FORTY THREE STATES. THAT REGULATE THAT SETTLEMENT. INCLUDING THE NINE IN WHICH THERE ARE OUT RIGHT NOW. THE BILL DOES NOT CUT OFF OR CONFLICT WITH THE FBI'S ABILITY TO REGULATE THAT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES JUST THE REVERSE. THIRTIETH PI WILL BE ABLE TO FORCE FORTINO FIVE ITSELF. MY APOLOGIES. THIS BILL DOES NOT CUT OFF FOR CONFLICT WITH THE FBI ABILITY TO REGULATE THAT PARLIAMENT COMPANIES JUST THE REVERSE DID THE FBI WILL BE ABLE TO ENFORCE PORTANTINO FIVE ITSELF NOR DOES THIS BILL OVER BURDEN DEBT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES THAT ARE ALREADY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FTC'S TELEMARKETING SALES RULE BECAUSE MANY OF THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THAT ROLE. AB FORTINO FIVE DOES GIVE CONSUMERS A CHANCE TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE IT REQUIRES THE COOLING OFF PERIOD TO PREVENT IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THEIR CREDIT IT ALLOWS THE CONSUMER TO DO MORE RESEARCH AND BE ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT THEIR CHOICE AND IT PROHIBITS MISLEADING ADVERTISING AND REVIEWS ANTISEPTIC DEBT SETTLEMENT PRACTICES FURTHERMORE AT FOURTEEN OH FIVE ENCOURAGES MARKETPLACE COMPETITION AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BY REQUIRING ALL THE GOVERNMENT COMPANIES OPERATING CALIFORNIA. TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME SET OF RULES THIS RESULT. IN MORE OPTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. SIMILARLY THE CARGO OF EIGHTY PORTANTINO FIVE WILL THAT LITTLE BECOMES SAFE PRODUCT MORE IMPORTANTLY ABLE PROVIDE REMEDIES FOR CONSUMERS INJURED BY THAT ACTORS. FINALLY BANK LENDERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE REGARDED AS SAFE FINANCIAL SERVICES BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVILY REGULATED. AT THAT MOMENT BECOMES MORE MAINSTREAM ENSURING THAT IT IS SAFE FOR CONSUMERS WILL ACTUALLY GIVE CALIFORNIANS MORE OPTIONS TO MANAGE THEIR TAX. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR I PUT.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARGARET LASTING HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FAIR CREDIT COUNCIL THE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY WE ARE OPPOSED AB EIGHT FOURTEEN OH FIVE. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO STEP EXCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WHICH ADDRESS SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS. DEBT SETTLEMENT OFFERS FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED CONSUMERS AN OPTION TO AVOID BANKRUPTCY IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE INDUSTRY CENTER NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS TYPICALLY SAVING THEM THIRTY FOUR CENTS ON THE DOLLAR INCLUDING FEET. INDUSTRY EMPLOYS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE STATE THAT SENTIMENT IS GOVERNED BY REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE OBAMA ERA FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. AMONG OTHER THINGS THOSE REGULATIONS PROHIBIT DEBT SETTLEMENT PROVIDERS FROM COLLECTING ANY FEES UNTIL LIKE IT'S EXCESSIVELY RUDE BECAUSE SHARED WITH A CREDIT CARD. THE CONSUMER HAS ACCEPTED THAT NEGOTIATION AND IT MADE A PAYMENT ON THE DEBT FROM AN ACCOUNT ONLY THE CONSUMER CONTROL. ACTUALLY HE IS NOT OPPOSED TO STATE OVERSIGHT ALL THEY DO WE DO QUESTION THE NEED FOR THE BELT GIVEN THE PASSAGE OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHICH GAVE THE FBI THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE US. IF THE BILL DOESN'T DO WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE BETTER PLACEMENT FINANCIAL CODE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE BROADER CONSUMER PROTECTION. WE COULD NOT OPERATE IN THE TO BE STRUCTURE CURRENTLY IN AB FORTINO FIVE BECAUSE IT WOULD PUT S. IN VIOLATION OF THE FTC RULES. ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT STRUCK THEM FROM THE BILL WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR COMMITTEE ON A REASONABLE FEE CAP BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE ROLE THAT. THIS TYPE OF THE CAP WILL PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION WHILE STILL ENABLING THE INDUSTRY TO SERVE THOSE WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT SOME. WE ALSO WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOME OF THE BILLS OPEN ENDED DEFINITIONS AND ONEROUS AND DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN OPERATE WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF THE LAW AND BE SUBJECT TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR A MINOR MISSTEPS AND DOES NOT HARM THE CONSUMER.

RESPECTFULLY AB FOURTEEN OH FIVE IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM FACING WORKING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES IN PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC IS THE EVER MOUNTING THE EVER INCREASING CONSUMER CREDIT CARD DEBT. DEBT SETTLEMENT IS NOT OFTEN THAT STANDS FOR THOSE WORKING CALIFORNIANS BUT TWAIN INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SOMETIMES AS HIGH AS. 3637% AND BANKRUPTCY. DEBT SETTLEMENT AS AN OPTION MANY WORKING CALIFORNIAN FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS FIND DESIRABLE. THIS THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD REGARDING ANY. DISRUPTION TO THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IN THE CURRENT MARKET PLACE WITH- WITH RELUCTANCE PARTICULARLY DURING THIS TIME. THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU RECENTLY RELEASED ITS TWENTY TWENTY REPORT. THAT REPORT FOUND OF THAT DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY ONE TENTH OF 1% OF ALL CONSUMER COMPLAINTS TO THE CFPB. IN IN IN CONTRAST. ONE MAIN FINANCIAL WHICH IS A HIGH INTEREST LENDER THE CHARGES INTEREST RATES. ARE SOMETIMES AS HIGH AS 36% ONE MAIN FINANCIAL WHICH IS A SUPPORTER OF AB FOURTEEN OH FIVE. HAD FIVE TIMES AS MANY COMPLAINTS ITSELF. TO THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THE CFPB DATA DEMONSTRATES THERE'S NO SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WITH THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY IS REGULATED FEDERALLY BY CFPB AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO THE TSR TELEMARKETING SALES REGULATION. DEBT SETTLEMENT PROVIDERS ARE REGULATED BY THE DFT I AND IF YOU MAKE YOUR FINAL COMMENTS THAT WOULD HELP. THANK YOU. BOB. THE. C. DRI DOESN'T DOESN'T OPPOSE ANY SENSIBLE BALANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION I REGULATION LET'S LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT THE INDUSTRY WELCOMES CLARITY AND STABILITY TO ITS PRACTICES.

THANK YOU MR- REALLY PREPARES ONE TO- SAY HOW EXCITED I AM TO HAVE YOU AS CHAIR OF MAKING FINANCING BEFORE TO MOVING FORWARD AS A UNDER LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE- YOU HAVE A QUESTION. FOR THE OFFICE OF THE BILL A REALLY PRETTY BRING THIS UP I HAD A CHANCE TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON DEBT SETTLEMENT AND- WE LEARNED A LOT MORE THAN I DID. THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS AND- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING UPON SOME RESEARCH THAT THE D. S. P. A. CURRENTLY ALREADY HAS AUTHORITY TO UTILIZE THEIR- PROVOCATIVE TO ENFORCE ACTIONS AGAINST BAD ACTORS. AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A CURRENT YOUR- LEGISLATION VERBIAGE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY PUTTING THIS IN THE FINANCIAL CODE AND UNDER THE FORTY OF THE D. F. YANG AND HOW THIS HAS THAT SOMETHING BEEN DISCUSSED WITH YOUR TEAM. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YEAH AND IF IT DOES HAVE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY- YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THE CIVIL CODE THAT OUR FINANCIAL PRODUCTS STUDENT LOANS CREDIT CARDS ETCETERA SO- THAT WOULD NOT NEGATE THE FEI FROM DO YOU HAVE THERE- US ALREADY SUCH. A DESCRIPTION ADDITIONAL TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX FOR THEM. AND OUT OF MY- ONE AND ELSE THAT DOES HAVE OTHER THOUGHTS. THANK YOU I'M ABOUT THE GREAT QUESTION SO I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT BUT LAST YEAR IN WORKING WITH THAT TERMINATE COMPANIES ON EIGHTY WO FIVE TWO FOUR WE GET TO WORK IN THE FINANCIAL CODE OF THIS AND A COMMON THEME THAT WE HEARD FROM OPPOSITION. WE HEARD THAT- THEY ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE CONCERNS WERE THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE IN THE FINANCIAL CODE AND- THIS YEAR GIVEN THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THEIR REQUEST FROM LAST YEAR AND I FIND IT APPROPRIATE TO GIVE A FILLIP CAL. WITH REGARD TO THE GST ID DO YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES- THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT BEFORE I MET APPROPRIATORS LAW AND CURRENTLY UNDER. EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR. MARK WHAT THE WORD THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO USE THAT SECTION OF THE CIVIL CODE AT THE TOP OF MOUNT MERRITT THEIR BROAD POWERS. BELL WILL NOT. THE PARKING AT THE FBI NOR WHAT CUT OFF ANY OF THEIR ABILITIES FOR ANY RULEMAKING. FOR IMPORTS MATCHING. THANK YOU- FOR THE AUTHOR FOR THAT RESPONSE ALSO SEE THAT IN YOUR BILL THAT THERE IS A EXEMPTION FOR ATTORNEYS- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED- ADDING THAT EXEMPTION- WITH A WIDER NET FOR ALL CALIFORNIA LICENSE ATTORNEYS TO HAVE PRACTICE- DEBT SETTLEMENT SERVICES OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREER. I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION. I UNDERSTAND OTHERS AT TWENTY EXEMPTION YOUR BILL. YEAH LET ME JUST READ YOU WANT TO CHIME IN ON THIS ONE. THANK YES I WOULD THANK YOU- YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION STILL THERE THE REFERENCE TRANSACTION- IN THE CURRENT LAW WHICH PREVIOUSLY. MADE EVERYTHING OVER THE PHONE AND COMPANIES ATTORNEYS WERE EXEMPTED HOWEVER WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT MANY ATTORNEY DOCUMENTS STATE ARE THEMSELVES CONDUCTING THAT PRODUCT SERVICES ALMOST ENTIRELY IT'S NOT THAT IT'S INCREMENTAL THEIR PRACTICE. AS A RESULT BE RETURNING. HAVE NO OVERSIGHT THEY ARE EXEMPTED FROM THE CURRENT LAW BY DEFINITION AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO THE TSR- LEAVE THE TREES AND ARE CHARGING EXORBITANT FEES THEY'RE OPERATING OUTSIDE OF THE REGULATIONS THAT THAT OTHER. COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW- SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE AN ATTORNEY AT LAW. IT ALSO CREATES YOU KNOW AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A WRITE A LETTER HAD TECH HE MORNING GOT GOVERNMENT COMPANY CAN- PARTNER WITH THE LAW FIRM IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT REGULATION. THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE THAT WE'VE SEEN NEED WE HAD INTELLIGENCE BY THE INDUSTRY THAT CERTAIN BAD ACTORS WILL CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW. I DO RESULT WE FIND THAT ATTORNEYS SHOULD BE REGULATED JUST LIKE THAT FROM THE COMPANY THAT IS IN FACT WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A PUBLIC CONTENT BECAUSE. OF A BAR LIKE. IT BEGAN TOWARDS- CREATING MORE CONTENT IN THE- AND LEVELING OF THE PLAYING. IT'S REALLY NOT FORGET COME. ARE COOPER AT PROPER DENTAL COMPANY'S BE A BY BY ONCE UP WILL. THAT FOR ANOTHER CLEAR. TO HAVE. TO- SACRAMENTO LOS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LICENSE ABOUT LIFE. THANK YOU BYE ST ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M I'M I WASN'T WHEN- AB EIGHT EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WAS PASSED BUT JUST MY UNDERSTAND IT JUST PASSED IT WENT INTO EFFECT OF THIS YEAR THREE MONTHS AGO YEAH. NOW WE'RE SHOULD WE WAIT TO SEE JUST AT LEAST LET IT RIDE THROUGH SO WE CAN SEE YOU DID THE WORK DID NOT WORK- WHY THE RUSSIAN GETTING ANOTHER BILL OR CHANGING THE FORMAT ALL OVER AGAIN ALMOST. WELL I MEAN YOU KNOW AS AS I MENTIONED IF YOU ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE- AND THIS WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL SORT OF TWO IN THE TOOLBOX FOR THEM. YOU KNOW I WORK ON THIS- IN THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR BEFORE YOUR RIVALS WELL WITH A DIFFERENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION- AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S VERY LIMITED REGULATION OF THAT SOME INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. NINE OTHER STATES HAVE COMPLETELY BANNED IT ALTOGETHER- WHICH IS NOT WHAT OUR INTENT IS AT ALL BUT WE DO WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE SORT OF BAD ACTORS IN THE SPACE. FORTY THREE OTHER STATES HAVE- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT REGULATIONS IN THE SPACE AS WELL- YOU KNOW AT WORK I'M HERE TO SEE- D. FEI IN THIS SPACE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD ULTIMATELY FOR CONSUMERS OBVIOUSLY- BUT THIS IS- NOT TO USURP- THEM BUT. TO CREATE ADDITIONAL TOOLS. THANK YOU. I NEED AT THAT. APPOINTMENT ONE BUTTON THAT NUMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I REQUEST THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WINS QUESTION WAS ANSWERED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WICKS SO I WILL MOVE ON THANK YOU FOR THAT I WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ASSEMBLYMEMBER COMMITTEE MEMBER AND THAT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. MISTER CHAIR I'M STILL AS THE OTHER NOTED IT IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS THERE CERTAINLY THERE ARE BAD ACTORS IN THIS SPACE AS YOU ALSO NOTED THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS THAT ARE PROVIDING. A REAL AND VALUABLE SERVICE FOR MANY MANY DISTRESSED CALIFORNIANS I'M IN MY VIEW IS WE MOVED TO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS IN THE SPACE I THINK AFTER JUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO THROW THE BABY OUT. WITH THE BATHWATER AS IT WERE- SO I DO HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO FIVE THE FIRST IS. IT NOW- DEBTS AMONG COMPANIES ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION- I'M RECOGNIZING THAT THAT LEAVES SOME LOOPHOLES FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST OPERATING INTEREST STATE. CAN YOU SPEAK TO TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE WHAT ARE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS. OF THIS FTC REGULATIONS YET- AND IS THERE N OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MORE CLEARLY AND CLEANLY ALIGN OUR CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS. SO THAT WE ESTABLISH STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WITHOUT CREATING KIND OF AT THE PATCHWORK FOR SURE THE NAVIGATE. YEAH NO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW THE SORT OF DAY OLD REGULATIONS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO FTC- THAT DID COME IN AND THE OBAMA ERA AS MENTIONED BY. BY MARGARET- AS YOU MENTIONED NOT ALL THAT SOME DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES- ARE- REGULATED UNDER THEM BECAUSE OF THE- IN STATE VERSUS INTEREST DATE ADD DYNAMIC RIGHT. IN ADDITION TO THAT MANY ADOPT PRACTICES THAT CIRCUMVENT FTC PRACTICES AND SO THAT THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE- YOU KNOW. ADDRESSING THE SORT OF LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE STARTED TO EXIST- I ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE FTC REGULATIONS I THINK FTC REVISIONS HOW WE NEED TO BE UPDATED AS WELL- BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS WE'RE CERTAINLY MINDFUL OF THAT WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE. TO YOUR POINT A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHERE THE DEATHS OF INDUSTRIES NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE ON CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA RIGHT THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT THE GOAL AND AS I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS. THERE ARE CUTTING MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE DOING GOOD THINGS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE SAYING YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE NEEDING THE SERVICES RIGHT NOW. BUT WE ALSO TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING SO IN A WAY THAT- THERE ARE BAD ACTORS IN THE SPACE RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE'RE CREATING- REGULATION THAT WILL CLOSE LOOPHOLES CREATING FAIRNESS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. I ENSURING WE DON'T HAVE DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING PRACTICES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE TO INSURE THAT WHEN CONSUMERS GO INTO AGREEMENT WITH THE DEATH OF THE COMPANY. THEY KNOW EVERYTHING UP FRONT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING- AND THERE'S REALLY BASIC FAIRNESS. AND THE TRANSACTION OF THEIR ENTRANCE. WELL THANK YOU THAT AND I A- AND SHE YOUR COMMENTS. SEPARATE CALIFORNIA I CONSUMERS AND SO I WILL. AS AS I HAD TO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I'M AND I AM GRATEFUL TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY. SO THAT WE DEVELOP REGULATIONS THAT THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS BUT- AND LET THESE BUT THE GOOD ACTORS YEAH. OPERATE WE WILL HAVE MANY MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATE MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS- RETURNING BACK TO VICE CHAIR CHEN. THANK YOU SIR I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THOSE IN SUPPORT OF WITNESSES- ANSWERING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD AND IT DOES REALLY ANSWER THAT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION JUST FOR WHEN THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- ONE THESE- CLRIFICATIONS IS- THIS HAS BEEN ABLE TO BRING ABOUT MORE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT WHICH- I MEAN ALSO. OF THE OPPOSITION IS STATED THAT- THE HEAVENLY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE- UNDER THE CURRENT- JURISDICTIONS OF DEPARTMENT SO I TO SOME CARVE- FROM ONE THE WITNESSES ANOTHER MARKETS LAST MAY- INTERN OF HER PERSPECTIVE ON ON THAT ON MY STATEMENT. MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE- CONNECTORS WITH MARGARET BLASTING TO ANSWER THAT. ONE NINETEEN HEAR ME YES GO. THANK YOU VERY QUESTIONS DR- I DO APPRECIATE IT NEEDS WE BELIEVE AND THEM HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY PROVIDED COMMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION ABOUT THE AREAS WHERE WE SUGGEST THEY REGULATE US TO ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THOSE HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH DISCLOSURES- THIS IS NEXT MISS WHICH SHALL- I WOULD NOTE THAT LAST YEAR WE DID IT WE OPPOSED AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FOUR AND IT CAME TO THIS COMMITTEE. NOT BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE FINANCIAL CODE BECAUSE IT PLACED US IN THE END- UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE PROGRAM OR SLOT WE PROVIDED MODEL LEGISLATION- THAT WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN IN THE FINANCIAL CO THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED STANDALONE LICENSING FOR THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY AND- YOU'RE CERTAINLY STILL OPEN TO THAT DISCUSSION BUT I THINK. GIVEN THE PASSAGE OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR LASTYEAR- I HAVE PLENTY OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI'S ABILITY TO REGULATE US AND PROVIDE THE TYPE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT THIS COMMITTEE ANTICIPATED. WHEN THEY PASSED THAT BILL LAST LAST YEAR. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I AM LOOKING FOR ANY FURTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SOME OF WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO OFFER CLOSING STATEMENTS JUST M. I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AND TALK TO THE OPPOSITION- AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE SUPPORTERS IN OPPOSITION FOR ENGAGING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND TAKING THE TIME TO REALLY DELVE DEEP INTO THIS BILL. I BELIEVE IT'S VERY VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION AND THE COMMITTEE IS ASKING FOR AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL WHICH ARE DETAILED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY ONE AMENDMENT WHICH IS THE AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO THE PRO RAIDERS LAW RECAP. I AM NOT STRICTLY OPPOSED TO A FEE CAP BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT IS IN THE BILL NOW IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO GO. IF THE AUTHOR DOES CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A BE CAPPED AT A LATER TIME I ASK THAT YOU KEEP ME F. COMMITTEE STAFF INFORMED OF YOUR EFFORTS. AND I HOPE YOU ARE ABLE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND JUST TO CLARIFY- TO THE AUTHOR- YOU ARE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS YES I'M ACCEPTING THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO I HAVE A MOTION. MOTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE SECOND BY THE SUMMER BARKHANE. THE MOTION BEFORE US IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. GRAYSON HI GRAYSON AYE CHAN. CHEN NO BETTER CAN'T WHERE CAN I BURKE. CHOI CHOI NO CERVANTES. GABRIEL CRISTINA GARCIA JEAN GARCIA HI WHEN. NO NO PETRIE-NORRIS PETRIE-NORRIS HI STONE STONE I WICKS HI WICKS HI. THE SIX FOOT. THIS BILL HAS SIX BOTH AND WE WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR THE CALL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR NEXT BILL IN FILE ORDER AND IT IS AB EIGHT SIX NINE. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AB EIGHT SIXTY NINE WOULD EXPAND CALIFORNIA'S POOLED MONEY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT THE P. M. I. A. TO INCLUDE DOLLAR DENOMINATED SOVEREIGN DEBT OF COUNTRIES WITH STRONG CREDIT RATING AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. CURRENTLY PM I A POLICY SUFFERS FROM LIMITED INVESTMENT FLEXIBILITY DUE TO OUTDATED STATUTE AND POLICY. WHICH ALLOWS ONLY FOR A LIMITED ARRAY OF INVESTMENT CHOICES. THE CURRENT INVESTMENT POLICY WAS WRITTEN DECADES AGO WHEN THE POOL WAS SMALL AND NEEDED TO BE KEPT IN THE MOST LIQUID AND CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS. TODAY HOWEVER THE FUNDS HAVE GROWN TO A POINT WHERE THE STATE IS LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE DUE TO ITS STRINGENT AND RESTRICTIVE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES. AB EIGHT SIX NINE WOULD CAREFULLY HELP EXPAND CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIA'S ARRAY OF INVESTMENT CHOICES WHILE ALSO PRIORITIZING DIVERSIFICATION AND SAFETY. A BROADER ARRAY OF SAFE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES WOULD ENHANCE COMPETITION AND ENABLE THE TREASURY TO RUN MORE EFFICIENTLY AUTHORIZING ADDITIONAL STATE INVESTMENT OPTIONS IS A LOGICAL STEP WITH LITTLE OR NO INCREMENTAL RISK TO PUBLIC FUNDS AS ONLY SAFE LIQUID INVESTMENTS WOULD BE CONSIDERED. EXPANDING CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT OPTIONS IS ALSO A NECESSARY IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE IT REFLECTS A GREATER NATIONAL SHIFT AS MANY OTHER STATES INCLUDING OHIO ILLINOIS INDIANA LOUISIANA OKLAHOMA GEORGIA COLORADO AND ARIZONA HAVE ALL INTRODUCED BILL SIMILAR TO AB EIGHT SIXTY NINE. LAST YEAR I INTRODUCED A SIMILAR BILL BUT THE BILL WAS NEVER HEARD IN COMMITTEE DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN. SO I RE INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION IT'S IMPORTANT. GIVEN THAT IT WOULD EXPAND AND UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S POLICY FRAMEWORK AND STATUTES TO ALLOW FOR AN ARRAY OF INVESTMENT CHOICES WHILE ALSO PRIORITIZING DIVERSIFICATION AND SAFETY. HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF- BUT B. AS SOON- IT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OUR STATE TREASURER FIONA MA AND KRISTEN TO CALI MORE.

OFFERS OFFICE I'M STATE TREASURER OF YOUR MOM I'M VERY HONORED TO BE HERE I AM THE PROUD SPONSOR OF THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER BLOOM FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT BILL AS HE MENTIONED- HE WAS VERY VERY DETAILED IN HIS TESTIMONY SO I DON'T WANT TO. REPEAT EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID BUT TODAY WE HIT AN ALL TIME HIGH OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR PMI A ACCOUNT AND THAT AMOUNT IS JUST GOING TO INCREASE AS WE RECEIVE MORE OF THE FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS. COMING IN SO THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE EIGHT ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX- ALLOW US SOME FLEXIBILITY SOME DIVERSITY DIVERSIFICATION OPTIONS AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID. OHIO ILLINOIS INDIANA LOUISIANA OKLAHOMA GEORGIA COLORADO AND ARIZONA HAVE INTRODUCED SIMILAR LEGISLATION- TO THIS AB EIGHT SIXTY NINE ALL OF THESE STATES HAVE HAD SUCCESS WITH THEIR NEW POLICIES GETTING DIVERSIFICATION WITHOUT SACRIFICING SAFETY AND I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE TREASURES. FROM ALL OF THE FIFTY STATES AND I CAN ATTEST THAT THIS. HAS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND DIVERSIFICATION I TO THEIR INVESTMENT- OP- POLICIES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND KRISTEN IS AVAILABLE IF ANYONE HAS THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OTHERWISE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM I ALSO WANT TO THANK TREASURER STAFF FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WALKING THROUGH IN DETAIL WHAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MEAN FOR THE STATE'S CASH FLOW. INITIALLY I DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT ONE OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN OUR STAFF. WAS THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE TREASURE INVESTMENT TEAM. WITH THAT. DO I HAVE A- I DO HAVE A MOTION. VICE CHAIR CHEN AND A SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. PETRIE-NORRIS SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND IT IS TO PASS THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. GRAYSON I GRAYSON AYE CHAN CHAN I CAN'T WHERE CAN I BURKE. CHOI CHOI I CERVANTES GABRIEL CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I WENT. WHEN I PETRIE-NORRIS BETWEEN NORTH AYE STONE. STONE I WICKS. IT HAS A BUILT. THE BILL HAS A VOTE AND WE WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR THE CALL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THANK YOU THE CINEMA BLEND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM SEVEN AB FOUR TWO FOUR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS. ANOTHER BILL AND IN A LONG STREAM OF BILLS WHO WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT TO STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN THIS CASE THESE ARE PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS THA WHAT HAPPENS. OFTENTIMES IS THESE BORROWERS. GET THEMSELVES OR THEIR QUESTIONS POTENTIALLY AROUND THEIR DAD AND THE COLLECTION AGENCY OR THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICER BRING SUIT AGAINST THEM. AND 91% OF THESE BORROWERS ARE UNREPRESENTED SO DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF AN ATTORNEY EXPLAINING WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN THEY RECEIVE THAT THAT LAWSUIT- THAT CLAIM. SO WHAT OFTEN THE COLLECTION AGENCY OR THE STUDENT SERVICER WILL THEN SEEK A DEFAULT JUDGMENT AND BECAUSE THE BORROWER DOES NOT KNOW ENOUGH TO RESPOND THAT DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS ENTERED OFTENTIMES THOSE DEFAULT JUDGMENT THAT THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH THOSE JUDGMENTS ARE BASED OR FAULTY BUT ONCE THE JUDGMENT IS ENTERED. THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DOCUMENTATION OR NO LONGER RELEVANT AND THE BORROWER IS STUCK HAVING TO PAY OFF OR DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THERE'S A DEFAULT JUDGMENT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL IS ENSURING THAT KNOWING THAT MOST OF THE THESE CASES ARE UNREPRESENTED. BORROWERS IS ENSURING THAT THE COLLECTION AGENCIES TO NON SERVICER WHOEVER'S BRINGING THAT CASE TO COURT. HAS TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY OWN ALONE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE MAKING THIS CLAIM THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT DEBTOR APPROPRIATE IDENTIFICATION SO THAT THE COURT THEN HAS AN APPROPRIATE RECORD. TO STAND UP FOR MAKING THAT THAT DEFAULT JUDGMENT SO WHAT HAPPENS OFTENTIMES AND IN THE WHAT A LOT OF THE RESEARCH SHOWS IS MANY OF THESE CASES. B. THE PARTY THAT BROUGHT THE CASE TO COURT DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE COULDN'T PROVE THAT THEY EVEN OWN THE DEBT AND AFTER HAVE MADE THE CASE. THIS IS A GREGIS. WHEN DOES THESE DEFAULTS GET ENTERED INTO IT BECOMES SORT OF AN ASSEMBLY LINE IF YOU WILL OF CASES JUST TO COLLECT ON DEBTS. THAT THE PARTY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A- ADEQUATELY ESTABLISHED THAT THEY ARE- THAT THAT. SO THIS BILL IS TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION AND ENSURE IT'S AN EVIDENCE BILL TO ENSURE THAT IN THAT CLAIM. THAT THE SERVICER OR THE DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES MAKING THAT THEY PUT IN RECORD ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH THEY IN FACT ARE THE OWNERS OF THE DEBT THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION THERE. THAT IF THEN THERE'S A DEFAULT JUDGMENT. WE KNOW THAT IT WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO BE A- A TRUE. CASE AND A AND AN APPROPRIATE DEFAULT JUDGMENT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS CASE WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT BORROWERS. FROM WHAT AMOUNTS TO SOME PREDATORY PRACTICES AGAINST THEM BY STUDENT LOAN SERVICING ORGANIZATIONS AND- THAT OTHER CREDITORS AND DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES I ASK FOR YOUR . BOATS. BUT I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR. MIKE HERE TO THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWER PROTECTIONS CENTER AND ROBERT SMITH OF THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES.

THE NEXT BILL THE FINAL ORDER IS AB TEN EIGHTY NINE FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU READY AT YOUR PLEASURE SIR. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU AB TEN EIGHTY NINE WHICH WILL UPDATE AND MODERNIZE THE CREDIT SERVICES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. TO EXPAND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHEN CONTRACTING WITH THE CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATION. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE STRONGEST CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE NATION. FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE CSOS TO PROVIDE EVEN BASIC INFORMATION. ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY ILL RENDER OR HAVE RENDERED HOW MUCH THEIR SERVICES ARE LIKELY TO COST WHEN THEY COMMITTEE AND COMMUNICATE WITH THIRD PARTIES ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER. OR A TIMELINE FOR WHEN THE SERVICES WILL BE COMPLETE THAT IS WHY AB TWENTY IS NEEDED TO ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY REQUIRING C. S. LOWS. TO TELL CONSUMERS WHAT THEY INTENDED TO PROVIDE ITEMIZED RECEIPTS AND DISCLOSURES. DISCLOSED TO CONSUMERS AND PROVIDE COPIES OF ALL COMMUNICATION AND ONCE IN THE COMMUNICATION ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER TO A THIRD PARTY REQUIRE CSOS TO DISCLOSE. THAT THE COMMUNICATION ORIGINATED FROM THE C. S. O. I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES. TODAY AND I WILL HAVE THEM SELF INTRODUCE THANK YOU. MISTER LESTER. THANK YOU. BURGER WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS HERE IN SUPPORT OF MR GRAYSON'S AB TEN EIGHTY NINE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR GRAYSON FOR OFFERING THIS BILL AND HIS STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THEY PUT INTO IT- AB TEN EIGHTY NINE IS INTENDED TO INCREASE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY PROVIDING GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR CONSUMERS DEALING WITH C. R. ROSE CREDIT REPAIR OR CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS. BOB PROVIDING CONSUMERS MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE SERVICES THEY ARE GETTING AND WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR WHEN THEY US SIGN UP FOR C. R. O. SERVICES- AS WELL AS PROVIDING MORE EFFECTIVE STATE GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT. I SEE OUR ROADS HAVE BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM FOR CONSUMERS FOR DECADES YOU ONLY HAVE TO READ THE LEGISLATIVE DECLARATIONS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AFTER. TO SEE THAT THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR DECADES. AS THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL POINTS OUT FEDERAL REGULATORS EVEN BEFORE THE KOBE PANDEMIC PUT OUT A WARNING TO CONSUMERS REGARDING USING THESE ENTITIES. I WITH THE CODE PANDEMIC ECONOMIC DISLOCATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT CONSUMERS PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME AND WORKING GOT CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE MARKETING OF THESE CREDIT FIX IT SCHEMES. AND ENTITIES AB TEN EIGHTY NINE IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO PROTECT LOW INCOME AND WORKING CALIFORNIANS FROM DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. LAST YEAR NEARLY IDENTICAL BILL AB SIX NINE NINE BY MR GRAYSON PASSES COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY THE SENATE ME ASSEMBLY SAID ASSEMBLY FLOOR UNANIMOUSLY BUT WAS NEVER HEARD IN SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DUE TO COAL WOULD SHORTEN. HEARING SCHEDULES WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THIS YEAR AND HOPEFULLY CAN GET IT THROUGH- THE CALL WILL BE A- LEGISLATIVE. PROCESS- THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR OUR SECOND WITNESS IN SUPPORT WILL ALSO BE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE- MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT AS WITH MS SYDNEY JACQUELINE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CINDY AUCKLAND I'M CURRENTLY SERVING AS A PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS. AND I'M A SECOND GENERATION COLLECTION AGENCY OWNER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AB TEN EIGHTY NINE IT'S FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY OUR MEMBERS AND ON BEHALF OF COLLECTION AGENCIES NATIONWIDE. CONSISTENTLY OUR MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED THAT CONSUMERS DID NOT ACTUALLY DISPUTE THE AMOUNT THAT SIGN. AND THEY'VE INDICATED THEY'RE SIGNATURE IN A LETTER SENT BY THE CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATION IS NOT THEIR SIGNATURE. CONSUMERS HAVE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AND ANGER AT THEIR CREDIT SCORE DID NOT INCREASE AS THE CSO HAD REPRESENTED. THEY HAVE PAID FOR SERVICES TO AT THE END SO WITH NO RESULTS AND ARE UNAWARE THAT LETTER TO DISPUTE ARE BEING SPENT ON PAID ACCOUNT. AND IT MULTIPLE LETTERS ARE MAILED AT THEIR COSTS FOR ACCOUNTS PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHEN CONTRACTING WITH THE SCSO RUPRECHT ONLY ASK. FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TEN EIGHTY NINE. THIS BILL IS CRITICALLY NEEDED TO UPDATE THE CREDIT SERVICES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT WILL ULTIMATELY INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DSS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- MISTER MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US WITH THOSE IN OPPOSITION- OVER THE PHONE THE FIRST ONE WILL BE MISTER ERIC CAMERON ON BEHALF OF LEXINGTON LAW. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR. MISTER CHAIR AND- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS OUR CAMERA- TODAY ON BEHALF OF LEXINGTON LAW IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. TEN EIGHTY NINE. LET ME START BY THINKING THE OPERATIVE STAFF FOR SOME VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR- AND OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPRESS CONCERNS- WE APPRECIATE HIS GOAL WITH THIS BILL BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT. CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE ON OUR ABILITY. TO ASSIST CONSUMERS AGAINST A LOT- DEBT COLLECTORS TO SPONSOR THIS BILL- I. BEGIN BY POINTING OUT THAT THERE IS SOME IRONY THAT DEBT COLLECTORS WHO ARE FREQUENTLY YOU'RE SUING CONSUMERS ARE NOW ATTEMPTING TO STEP INTO THE POSITION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES TO PROTECT CONSUMERS- I ALSO NOTE. THE COMMENTS RELATIVE TO CALL THAT IN THE PROTECTIONS THAT CONSUMERS NEED- MANY STATES ARE MORE FOCUSED ON- BE COLLECTION ACTIVITIES THAT GO AFTER STIMULUS MONEY- THEN AFTER- CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES- THIS IS- NOT AN AREA WHERE WE'VE SEEN THAT- CONSUMER FINANCE HAVING AN OUTCRY FOR CHANGE- WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING IN. ISSUE OF CONSUMER ABUSE AND WE DON'T LAST YEAR WITH THE SENATE BILL START WITH ASSEMBLY BILL. SIX NINETY NINE THIRTY SECONDS CONSUMER GROUPS. THEN CAME. IN SUPPORT OF THE- WE REMIND YOU CAN THAT CONSUMERS TO US WHEN THEY NEED HELP- OUR INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THOSE CONSUMERS. AND UNFORTUNATELY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. SECOND WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WILL BE. RUNNING DELAY ME ON BEHALF OF NIELSEN PERSIMMON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MANY MUCH MORE ABOUT THE ARMY FROM NIELSEN MARK BURKE SHARE ON BEHALF OF THE CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS PROGRESSION. HELLO FROM HOME YOU JUST HEARD I LIKE TO THINK CHAIR GRAYSON AND ITS STAFF FOR ALL THEIR TIME AS WELL BEING BACK LAST YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD WITH RESPECT TO LAST YOUR BILL HAVE CARRIED OVER INTO EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY NINE ONLY NOT THEIR PART BECAUSE THE BILL TODAY. WE'RE NOT GONNA GO INTO THE BILL'S LICENSING PROVISIONS WE UNDERSTAND THE DOCTOR PLANS TO DELETE THEM. WE SIMPLY THINK THE AUTHOR TOLD THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND WILL FINALLY REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE ACTION ONCE THE BILL OF THE MIND THAT. ARE REMAINING OPPOSITION REALLY BOILS DOWN TO ONE OVERARCHING CONCERN BARBARITY TO CONTINUE TO ASSIST OUR CONSUMER THAT'S ACTIVELY MOVING FORWARD WE DO NOT OBJECT TO PROTECTIONS AND OVERSIGHT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE AGREE THAT PROVIDING CLEAR DUE TO THE CONSUMER ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY ARE GETTING AND HOW THEY ARE GETTING THAT IS IMPORTANT. BUT WHILE WE DON'T BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN CAN AUTHOR EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY NINE WITH FUNDAMENTALLY OUR ROAD- BILITY TESTERS CONSUMERS AND ONE CRITICAL WAY THAT IS BY DIFFERENTIATING IDENTITY OF THE CSO COMBAT OF THE CONSUMER. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL REQUIRES DIRECTORS TO DESCRIBE IDENTITY ON COMMUNICATIONS PROTECT FROM EMITTING A COMMUNICATION AND I CALLED INCRIMINATING AND CONSUMER AND OTHER ECLIPSE ON A CERTAIN TAKEN ACTION FROM THE NO CONSUMERS REPRESENTED. WE TAKE GREAT EXCEPTION WITH EVEN THE SUGGESTION BETTER CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION IMPERSONATES THE CLIENT THEY REPRESENTED. BOTH A LOADED TERM LEADING ONLY BELIEVE IT SHOULD. BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. FEDERAL FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT RIGHT FURTHER IN DETAIL IN OUR WATER LITERALLY TO TOP OF THAT THIS IS THE BALL GAME IT'S A GIFT TO THE AND WHAT HER THE CONSUMER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO BUY NO ON BEHIND THE NINE AT PRINCE BUT WE THINK THE AUTHOR LOOKED TO CONTINUING.
