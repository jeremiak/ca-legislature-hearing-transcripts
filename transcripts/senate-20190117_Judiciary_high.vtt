THEY PASSED BLOOD CLOTS LARGER

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:53.839

I'LL KEEP GOING HERE.

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:23.302
I HAVE A DREAM WHEN WOMEN CAN

00:18:23.368 --> 00:18:25.737
SUCCEED WITH THAT WITHOUT HAVING

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.072
TO KILL THEIR CHILDREN.

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.675
I HAVE A DREAM WHERE WE CAN ALL

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.543
WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.378
WOMEN HAVE THE RESOURCES AND

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:35.180

PREGNANCY. FOR THAT BOY ABORTION

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:41.620

I INVITE YOU TO SHARE THAT DREAM

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:46.525
pOF CALIFORNIANS TO REJECT

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:47.860
ABORTION.

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:49.595
ABORTION RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:53.465

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.434

HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART.

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:23.128
JUST LIKE JEAN ROW OF ROE VERSUS

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.564
WADE HER REAL NAME IS NORMA

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:28.000
MCCORVEY WHO ACTUALLY NEVER HAD

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:31.737
COMPLETE CHANGE OF HEART

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:33.739

ABORTIONS IN HIS LIFETIME.

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:48.287
BUT LATER BECAME A PRO LIFE.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:50.923
IN PRODUCER OF THE SILENT SCREEN.

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:54.660
THERE IS HOPE AND FORGIVENESS

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.094
FOR MERCY.

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:57.529
IN CLOSING.

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:59.498
DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.134
SAID THAT OUR LIVES BEGIN TO END

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.303
THE DAY WE BECOME SILENT ABOUT

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.704
THE THINGS THAT MATTER.

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:08.040

THE MOST ATROCIOUS WHOLE COST IN

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.652

AND PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.508
THIS RESOLUTION.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.777
THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO CONTROL

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:47.279
OUR REPRODUCTION.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:48.380
IS ABOUT.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:50.749
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT I CAN

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.317
THINK OF THAT WOMEN HAVE.

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:55.721
AND UNFORTUNATELY IN NINETEEN

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:57.155
SEVENTY THREE I WAS.

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:59.324
AN ADULT AT THAT POINT IN TIME I

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:00.692
HAD SEEN FRIENDS OF MINE.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.328
GO DOWN TO MEXICO BECAUSE THEY

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:05.497
COULD NOT HAVE LEGAL ABORTIONS

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:07.532
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.867
COMING BACK.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:09.601
SOME OF THEM --

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.571
IS SEVERELY DAMAGED BY THESE.

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.306
PROCEDURES.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:15.941
AND YET DESPERATE TO BE ABLE TO

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:18.977
LIVE THEIR LIVES AS THEY CHOSE.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:21.346
SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.881
STRONG --

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.416
ELEMENT THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.784
THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:26.985
MAKE THAT CHOICE.

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:29.721
HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS AMONG

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:31.556
OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.959
IT'S BECOME THE SENATE TRADITION

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:36.028
TO MARK THIS ANNUAL EVENT.

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.829
IS WELL WE SHOULD AS IT IS

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:38.964
ROOTED IN OUR NATION'S

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.766
CONSTITUTION THAT A WOMAN HAS A

00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:43.135
RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:44.703
AND MAKE HER OWN CHOICES.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.471
AND IN CONSULTATION WITH HER

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:49.174
FAMILY OR HER WHOM EVER SHE

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.575
CHOOSES.

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:52.077
YOU REFERENCE THE DEMOCRATIC

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:52.911
PARTY.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.180
I GREW UP IN A REPUBLICAN

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.948
HOUSEHOLD BACK IN THE AREA OF

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:58.483
MASSACHUSETTS.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.252
NELSON ROCKEFELLER WAS ONE OF MY

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:01.920
HEROES GROWING UP.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.388
AND I REMEMBER MY PARENTS SAYING

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.323
WHAT POSSIBLE RIGHT IS IT OF THE

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.493
GOVERNMENT TO TELL A WOMAN WHAT

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.928
SHE SHOULD DO WITH HER BODY.

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.229
AND I THINK THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:12.831
PRINCIPLE THAT HAS SURE

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:14.099
HOPEFULLY.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.634
SHOULD SURVIVE TO THE REPUBLICAN

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.169
PARTY NOTION THAT GOVERNMENT

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:18.437
SHOULD NOT BE INTERFERING IN

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:19.871
PEOPLE'S LIVES ANYMORE THAN

00:22:19.938 --> 00:22:20.739
NECESSARY.

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.207
AND CERTAINLY TO INTERFERE IN

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:24.376
THAT MOST BASIC FUNDAMENTAL

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:25.644
RIGHT.

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:29.047
OF WHEN WITH WHOM AND WHETHER TO

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:30.382
HAVE A FAMILY.

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:32.184
IS AMONG THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.685
RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE.

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.654
SO THIS IS A QUESTION OF

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:37.422
EQUALITY FOR MANY OF US.

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:38.890
BY -- TAKE

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:40.425
UMBRAGE IN SOME OF THE

00:22:40.492 --> 00:22:42.227
CHARACTERIZATIONS BUT THIS IS A

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.096
BATTLE WE'VE BEEN HAVING FOR

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:46.598
DECADES AND I'M NOT GOING.

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:47.165
TO GET DOWN IN THE MUD ON IT

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:49.801
AGAIN -- THE

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.270
TWO USED MARTIN LUTHER KING AS

00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:53.305
YOUR REFERENCE I THINK --

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:55.474
THIS MARCHES HIS GOOD REPUTATION

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.875
AND THE THINGS THAT HE STOOD FOR

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:58.910
WHICH WERE EQUALITY AND JUSTICE

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:01.012
FOR ALL --

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:05.016
BUT IT IS DEEPLY IRONIC THAT

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:07.919
THOSE WHO CONDEMN DEMOCRATS FOR

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.588
SUPPORTING THIS --

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.289
CLAIMING THAT THIS IS.

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:13.291
A VALUE OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:15.861
PARTY I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:18.563
IT IS TOTALLY CONTRARY. TO THE

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.998
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AT LEAST

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.433
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I GREW

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.400
UP IN.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.202
BUT THIS ISN'T A PARTY ISSUE

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:26.371
THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE.

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:28.306
THIS IS A WOMEN'S RIGHTS ISSUE.

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:29.641
AND WITH THAT --
