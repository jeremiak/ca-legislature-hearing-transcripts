00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.719

THIS PROBLEM ISN'T JUST IN SAN

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.423
BENITO COUNTY IT IS AN EPIDEMIC

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.991
THAT IS AFFECTING YOU ACROSS

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.160
CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:29.895
AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION YOUTH

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:33.699
USERS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:34.766
BECOME LIFELONG TOBACCO USERS.

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.468
WITH MORE SEVERE ADDICTIONS.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.036
AND BIG TOBACCO IS TAKING

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.339
ADVANTAGE OF THIS FACT- VAPING

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.107
PRODUCTS THEY ARE TARGETING AND

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.775
HOOKING KIDS AT AN EARLIER AGE

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:44.876
WHEN THEY ARE MORE VULNERABLE

00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:45.978
AND MORE LIKELY TO BECOME

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:48.146
LIFELONG ATTICS. AND SADLY

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:49.514
THEIR PREDATORY TACTICS HAVE

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.450
BEEN SUCCESSFUL VAPING WITH

SADLY THE YOUTH VOTE A VAPING

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.494

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.935
CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER YOUTH

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.876
WHY SB THREE NINETY FIVE IS SO

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.145
IMPORTANT. THE ADDED TAX WOULD

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:21.947

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.492

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:47.857
IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:49.192
WE HAD A BILL THAT WOULD

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:51.161

PLATFORMS IN IT DIED A PAINFUL

00:53:58.368 --> 00:53:59.536
DEATH JUST BEING CANDID

SEVENTEEN AND IT DIED AGAIN. SO%

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.876

FELT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A

00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:21.625
VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENT

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:22.826

ORDINANCE TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

00:54:24.494 --> 00:54:26.162

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.833
AMOUNT OF. REVENUE BECAUSE OF

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.068
THE PENALTIES IN THIS WOULD

YOU DR CURRICULA QUESTION. NO

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:16.479
I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT- SOME

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:18.381
PRACTICAL ASPECTS AGAIN I'M FOR

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:20.016
I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:21.851
OF AFFORD ON THE FLOOR BUT I

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:23.153
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:25.088
REALLY PRACTICAL FOR EXAMPLE

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.223
SOME CITIES ACCORDING TO THE

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:30.393
ANALYSIS. TAX BASED ON THE LIST

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.163
PRICE NOW. WHAT I WOULD

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.665
ENVISIONED- THE TAX AUTHORITY

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:40.370
DOING HERE IS PEOPLE SEND IN

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:42.338
THEIR TAX BILL IN APRIL. YOU

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:43.773
CAN SEE WHAT THE GROCERY SEATS

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.075
WHERE WHAT THEIR TAXABLE

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:48.244
RECEIPTS WERE- HOPEFULLY

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.646
EVERYTHING CAN BE TIED IN WITH

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:52.282
COMPUTERS. BUT WHEN YOU SAY CAN

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:53.616
BE DONE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:56.586
REALLY DONE- LET'S ASK EIGHTY

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.455
D. ABOUT THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:01.024
SO I HAVE SOME SKEPTICISM- BUT

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:04.127
THE TOUGHER PART IS IF IT IS

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:07.297
BASED UPON THE LIST PRICE. WHO

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:09.365
HAS THAT INFORMATION. THE LIST

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:10.600
PRICE AT THE TIME OF THE RENTAL

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:12.469
COULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.404
THE LIST PRICE THAT'S AVAILABLE.

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:15.739
MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER THE

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:18.341
ACTUAL WORK AND YOU CAN SAY ALL

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:19.509
RIGHT THAT'LL BE SENT IN BY THE

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:21.211
CITY THAT SEEMS LIKE THE BEST

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:23.313
WAY TO DO IT. I'M JUST NOT SURE

00:56:23.379 --> 00:56:24.814
YOU CAN GET ALL THAT TOGETHER

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:29.753
AND DO IT RIGHT BYE. BYE LESS

00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:30.353
THAN IT WELL ABOUT A YEAR FROM

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.256
NOW. SOON THE BILL PASSES- I

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:36.826
JUST. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED ENOUGH

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:39.395
A LOT OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:42.065
THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK. THE

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:43.833
SECOND THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.935
AND- WHEN THEN PERHAPS YOU

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:48.438
COULD ANSWER THAT AND ALSO WHAT

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.440
DISCUSSIONS HAVE YOU HAD WITH-

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:52.542
THE TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION

00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:53.843
THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THIS WORK

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.712
THE REASON WHY WE MODELED- THIS

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:57.680
BILL OFF OF THE CHAIRWOMAN'S

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:59.616
ONLINE FACILITATOR ACT.

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:01.885
LEGISLATION IS BECAUSE THE

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:03.186
SYSTEM IS ALREADY BEEN

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:04.487
CORRECTED I HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:06.723
CREATED SO VERY SIMILAR- THE

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.958
ONLINE PLATFORM ON A QUARTERLY

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.927
BASIS WOULD TURN IN UNDER

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:13.630
PENALTY OF PERJURY. THOSE TAX

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:15.265
OBLIGATIONS THOSE BED TAX

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:17.033
OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SPECIFIC

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:17.634
COMMUTING WHICH THEY'RE DOING

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.403
BUSINESS IN. CD TFA WOULD THEN

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.973
REMIT THOSE- PAYMENTS TO THE

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.776
CITY OR COUNTY OF ORIGIN- AND

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:27.944
SO THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.412
CREATED WHICH IS GREAT IN

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:32.348
ADDITION CD TFA ALSO COLLECTS-

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:34.184
A UTILITY USERS TAX FOR ALL OF

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.652
MUNICIPALITIES AND THEY'RE ALSO

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.520
RESPONSE FOR SALES TAX SO. I

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.956
HEAR YOU AND WE ALL- HAVE

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:41.891
INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES WITH EDT

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.560
BUT THE AGENCY IS INCREDIBLY

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:45.829
BUTTONED UP AND THANK AND I'M

00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:46.896
NOT TRYING TO JUST BLOW SMOKE

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:47.964
BECAUSE THAT YOUR WOMAN THIS

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:51.534
YEAR- BUT- THEY- THEY THEY

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:54.137
REALLY HAVE- THE- THEY'VE GONE

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:55.972
THROUGH THE BIG KAHUNA IF YOU

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:57.207
WILL WITH THIS ONLINE

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:59.275
FACILITATOR ACT- IN DEVELOPING

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:01.644
THE SYSTEM. OKAY SO YOU'RE

00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:04.047
SAYING THE- CITY AFFECT THE

00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:06.015
RENTERS WOULD HAVE TO DO AND

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:07.784
QUARTERLY REPORTS AS TO THEIR

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.619
GROSS INCOME ANY NET INCOME IT

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:10.787
WOULD ACTUALLY BE UP TO THE

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:12.822
PLATFORM TO THE PLATFORMS SO

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:14.624
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE AIRBNB OR

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:17.894
EXPEDIA WOULD HAVE TO RENEW IT.

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:20.096
IF THERE IS S. AS IN THE

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:25.969
REMAINS HAD SAID. IF THE CITY

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:26.903
OPSIN. THE PLOT WITH THE REMIT

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.938
TO THE CAL APARTMENT T. AND IF.

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.274
ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. BASED OFF

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.142
OF THOSE RECEIPTS IN THAT

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:35.211
INDIVIDUAL CITY OR COUNTY'S BED

00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:37.680
TAX RATE. THAT WILL THOSE

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.015
DOLLARS WOULD THEN BE REMITTED

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:42.352
BACK TO THE CITY NOW CD TFA.

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:44.120
FULL TRANSPARENCY AS THEY DO

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:45.722
WITH ONLINE FACILITATOR ACT

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:47.357
DOES TAKE A VERY SMALL MINISTER

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.359
TO SEE OFF THE TOP- BUT THAT'S

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:50.526
HOW IT WOULD WORK IT WOULD BE

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:51.494
BASED OFF OF THE ACTUAL

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:53.162
PLATFORM AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:55.198
HOME USER WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:57.033
CRITICAL THAT THE PLATFORM DOES

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.435
IT. SO WE'RE NOT BURNING-

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:02.171
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF-

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:04.774
HOMEOWNERS. ARM SO THE PROBLEM

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:06.276
IS IF THEY'RE DOINGIT BASED ON

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:08.678
TAXABLE RECEIPTS THEN YOU DON'T

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.246
KNOW WHAT THAT IS AND TOLD.

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:13.016
PEOPLE FILE THEIR TAXES SO YOU

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.517
MAY HAVE A QUARTERLY REPORT

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:15.752
WHICH YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:18.354
WHAT THE TAXES WERE UNTIL. A

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:22.125
YEAR LATER. IT'S BUT IT'S BASED

00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:23.326
OFF OF THOSE QUARTERLY THE DID

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.028
THE BOOK OF BUSINESSES THEY DO

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:27.297
IN THAT QUARTER IN THE PAST SO

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.432
THEY KNOW SO THE- THE ONLINE

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.801
PLATFORM KNOWS. HOW MANY ROOM

00:59:31.868 --> 00:59:35.004
NIGHTS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF. OKAY

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.873
YOUR TURN BACK GROCERY SEATS.

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:39.275
SOME PEOPLE TAX BASED UPON

00:59:39.342 --> 00:59:42.445
TAXABLE. RIGHT INCOME YOU DON'T

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:43.880
KNOW THAT UNTIL THE END OF THE

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:46.316
YEAR AND YOU'VE- PUT UP ALL OF

00:59:46.382 --> 00:59:48.151
YOUR INCOME AND ALL OF YOUR

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:52.188
DEDUCTIONS. SO FOR A OF HOPE

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:52.789
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS YOU

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:56.192
WANT CD- THE TAX AND- FIFTH

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:57.493
ALREADY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.928
PRESUMABLY HAVE THE TAX

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:01.164
INFORMATION BUT THAT TAX

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.398
INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:04.600
QUARTERLY IT'S AVAILABLE. AFTER

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.536
YOU FINISH THE YEAR AND YOU

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:10.106
SUBTRACT EXPENSES FROM INCOME

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.442
WELL CURRENTLYRIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:15.078
JUST MODELING THIS OFF OF AND

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.981
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE- NOT NOT

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:19.248
TRYING TO- GO AROUND YOUR

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.116
QUESTION THE BOTTOM LINE IS

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:23.453
THIS. SO RIGHT NOW IF FOR

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.620
EXAMPLE THE CITY OF HILLS

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:27.156
BURKE. COLLECTS AND THEY

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:29.559
ALLOWED VACATION RENTALS- IN

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:30.460
THE TO VOLUNTARY COLLECTION

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:32.295
AGREEMENT THE CITY HILLS BURKE

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:34.230
WITH AIRBNB WOULD GET A CHECK

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.132
EVERY QUARTER BASED OFF OF THE

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.334
ACTUAL. DATE BOOK OF BUSINESS I

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:39.435
HEAR YOU IN REGARD TO THE

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:41.337
HOMEOWNER- BUT THAT'S THAT'S

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.505
CURRENTLY HOW THIS WOULD BE

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.240
STRUCTURED OKAY SO YOU'RE NOT

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.009
GOING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.944
WAY SOME CITIES DO IT. WHERE

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.313
IT'S ON TAXABLE INCOME IT WOULD

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.447
BE BASED OFF OF THE NUMBER OF

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:53.182

IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS. YOU

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.755
CAN'T DO IT BASED ON TAXABLE

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.223
INCOME YOU PROBABLY CAN'T DO IT

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.924
BASED ON LIST PRICE YOU HAVE TO

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:04.027
DO IT ON GROSS INCOME AT THE

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:07.263
TIME EXACTLY. THAT THAT ANSWERS

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.165
MY QUESTION ONCE YOU'VE GOT

DO IT THE SECOND PART OF THIS.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.874
IS IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO SIGN

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.743
PEOPLE UP. IF THEY HAVE TO PAY

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:25.348
UP FRONT. FOR BRINGING UP THE

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:31.187
SYSTEM. AND. I WISH YOU HAD

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:33.189
JUST ASK FOR MONEY FROM THE

SELECCIONA DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.904
TO ASK SENATOR HERTZBERG

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.239
QUESTION THANK YOU CHAIR MADAM

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.942
CHAIR AND- MY COLLEAGUE- FROM

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:36.412
PALM SPRINGS- ALREADY INVOKED-

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.947
THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY EMPOWER

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:40.583
MY COLON AT THE LORD'S WORK- SO

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.018
NOT SURE IF MY QUESTION REALLY

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:44.587
MATTERS AT THIS POINT- BUT I DO

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:48.257
WANT TO. ASK A QUESTION.

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.458
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE BILL IS

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.794
LAUDABLE- IN THE EFFORTS OF THE

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:54.363
AUTHOR. NOT ALL ONLINE

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.799
OPERATORS OPERATE THE SIX

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:58.901
CORRECT SO YOU HAVE A VERY

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.337
PROMINENT OPERATOR. THAT HAS

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:02.471
ONE MODEL BUT THEN THERE ARE

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:06.042
OTHER- ONLINE OPERATORS THAT

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:06.842
OPERATE UNDER A DIFFERENT

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:09.412
MODEL. ONE PROMINENT OPERATOR

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:11.414
TAKES MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.649
PERSON RENTING OR THE SHORT

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.351
TERMRENTAL WHEREAS OTHER

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.286
ONLINE OPERATORS ARE JUST

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.222
FACILITATORS WHERE THEY CONNECT

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:20.923
THE RENTER WITH THE PROPERTY

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.824
OWNER THAT'S PROVIDING THE

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:25.061
SPACE. SO IS THIS BILL-

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.629
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN THE

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.665
TWO- SO THAT- THE PERSON THAT

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.500
IS TRULY LIABLE FOR PAYING THE

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.402
TAX. IS THE ONE ACTUALLY PAYING

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:35.538
THE TAX I BELIEVE IT IS THE

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:37.440
CASE AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.375
AS WE HAVE OVER THE MANY YEARS

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.244
HAVE DEALT WITH THESE ISSUES

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.979
WHAT IT WAS INTERNET TAXATION

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.181
OR THE LIKE. WILL END AND WE

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.816
HAVE DEALT SENATE MCGUIRE

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.217
INTRODUCED A BILL LIKE THIS

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:49.085
THAT I DIDN'T PASSED WHEN I WAS

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:50.820
CHAIR OF HIS COMMITTEE- BECAUSE

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:52.655
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS COOKED-

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.757
AND SO IT'S A LOT BETTER NOW.

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.926
BUT BUT- LOOKI THINK IT'S

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:57.960
GONNA BE SOME CHALLENGES I

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:58.995
THINK TO SOME CHALLENGES WITH

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.696
AGENTS WE SEE WITH GRUBHUB WE

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:01.764
SEE WITH A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.966
ISSUES WE FACE THIS. BUT I

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:04.967
THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.902
FIRST STEP. WITH RESPECT TO

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:07.937
BASICALLY DEALING WITH THIS

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.372
DYNAMIC BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:12.375
ARCHITECTS DOT HOTELS AND HOW

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.510
THIS WORKS HOW DO WE SUPPORT

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.344
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS GET THEM

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:16.912
REVENUES. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:18.714
HICK UPS THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:21.284
ABOUT IT SO- THE GOOD NEWS IS

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:25.087
TO BE. MORE LEGISLATION NEXT

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:25.788

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:26.622

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:27.790
OUR BEST TO TRY TO GET RID OF

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:28.991
THOSE HICCUPS AS QUICK AS

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.493
POSSIBLE SO I WOULD JUST SIMPLY

FUTURE WOULD BE. VERY COGNISANT

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.671
OF THE FACT THAT THERE MIGHT BE

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.806
A SITUATION WHERE AN ONLINE

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:46.309
PROVIDER IS. BEING HELD LIABLE

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:46.876
FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:48.210
ACTUALLY NOT LIABLE FOR

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.245

AUTHOR HAD MENTIONED EARLIER

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.875
