00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:33.490 region:rollup2
STATE OF OUR ENGAGEMENT NO SAMMY

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:35.693 region:rollup2
HERE AT ALL NAM AND THE THE

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:37.761 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN VERY STRONG

00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.762 region:rollup2
THIS IS A LOT OF WORK. ARM

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:40.097 region:rollup2
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED FOR THE

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:42.099 region:rollup2

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:45.769 region:rollup2
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND WE'VE

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:50.174 region:rollup2
MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:51.976 region:rollup2
ARM IN IMPLEMENTING DOT CCR.

00:51:50.174 --> 00:51:53.577 region:rollup2
COM AND AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES

00:51:51.976 --> 00:51:55.346 region:rollup2
THERE SOME AREAS WHERE WE'VE HAD

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:56.647 region:rollup2
SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THE

00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:58.415 region:rollup2
DELAYS IN THE RESOURCE FAMILY

00:51:56.647 --> 00:51:59.984 region:rollup2
APPROVAL PROCESS THAT YOU'VE

00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:00.985 region:rollup2
HEARD A LOT ABOUT ALREADY. ON

00:51:59.984 --> 00:52:02.252 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S ONE OF THOSE AREAS

00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:03.420 region:rollup2
THAT MR LIKE PORN DISCUSSED

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:05.489 region:rollup2
WHERE WE MADE MYTH MID COURSE

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.490 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONS WE IDENTIFIED SOME

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:08.826 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WEREN'T WORKING ON

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.593 region:rollup2
WE MADE SOME CHANGES TO. ON TO

00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:11.595 region:rollup2
TRY TO IMPROVE THINGS.

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:14.465 region:rollup2
.

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:16.200 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN OVERALL THE ARC OF CCR

00:52:14.465 --> 00:52:17.935 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY WHAT WE'D EXPECT

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.537 region:rollup2
AND WE DO WANT TO RAISE SORT OF

00:52:17.935 --> 00:52:22.272 region:rollup2
ONE. ARM ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE

OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATION AND I

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:25.976 region:rollup2
THINK WE'LL ELUCIDATED MORON.

DIFFERENT BUDGET PROPOSALS ARM

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:29.079 region:rollup2
BETTER THAT ARE COMING FORWARD.

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:31.215 region:rollup2
SO THE KEY COMPONENT OF THE KEY

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:33.384 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS OF CCAR'S THIS TWELVE

00:52:31.215 --> 00:52:35.786 region:rollup2

WE KNEW THEM ARE NO LONGER.

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:40.290 region:rollup2
AND.

WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT

THAT

00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:54.431 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THAT TO SOME DEGREE THIS

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:56.233 region:rollup2
IS JUST IMPLEMENTATION REALITY

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:58.102 region:rollup2
THAT AYE SFC.

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:59.770 region:rollup2
STATE INSTRUCTIONS JUST CAME OUT

00:53:58.102 --> 00:54:01.672 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SO I'M NOT

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:02.639 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS LIKELY

00:54:01.672 --> 00:54:04.441 region:rollup2

GIVEN THAT TWELVE THIRTY ONE

00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:10.647 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY.

00:54:09.513 --> 00:54:12.683 region:rollup2
IS WORRISOME AND SO THE OTHER

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:14.251 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THAT COIN IS THAT THE

00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:16.120 region:rollup2

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.123 region:rollup2
I THINK THE LATEST DATA SUGGEST

00:54:18.055 --> 00:54:20.924 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTEEN

00:54:19.123 --> 00:54:23.060 region:rollup2

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.163 region:rollup2

THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:58:08.452 --> 00:58:13.090 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO MONITOR WITH THE

00:58:10.287 --> 00:58:14.925 region:rollup2
STATE AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.560 region:rollup2
TOM IS THAT WE DON'T DO HARM.

00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:18.128 region:rollup2
AT A MINIMUM WE SHED HIPPOCRATIC

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.297 region:rollup2
STANDARD AND CCR.

00:58:18.128 --> 00:58:22.499 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:20.297 --> 00:58:24.167 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:26.803 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO THAT

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:28.438 region:rollup2
GOAL ARM.

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.673 region:rollup2
FROM THE FRONT LINES THE PEOPLE

00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:31.041 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM AT THE

00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:32.242 region:rollup2

STATE IN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:35.679 region:rollup2
SS.

00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:38.281 region:rollup2
WE THINK THERE'S REASON.

00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:39.750 region:rollup2
FOR US TO EXAMINE

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:41.551 region:rollup2
AND START TO THINK ABOUT.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:43.019 region:rollup2
WHAT CONTINGENCY PLANS WE MIGHT

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:44.921 region:rollup2
MAKE IF?

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:46.890 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FACILITIES

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:48.325 region:rollup2
AND HIGH QUALITY FAMILIES

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.893 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT CHILDREN FROM

00:58:48.325 --> 00:58:50.861 region:rollup2
UNWITTINGLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.762 region:rollup2
BEING WORSE OFF BY CC ARE NOT

00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:54.664 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:58:51.762 --> 00:58:58.535 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SIR.

00:58:54.664 --> 00:59:00.404 region:rollup2

COUNTY. AREN'T KINGS COUNTY IS A

00:59:06.176 --> 00:59:09.980 region:rollup2
MEDIUM SIZE ON VALLEY COUNTY

00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:11.848 region:rollup2
WITH A POPULATION OF ABOUT

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:14.317 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND WE'RE

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:15.485 region:rollup2
BORDERED BY FRESNO. TULARE AND

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:17.020 region:rollup2
KERN COUNTIES.

00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:17.954 region:rollup2
AND CURRENTLY IN OUR COUNTY WE

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.723 region:rollup2
HAVE ABOUT.

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:21.057 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE

00:59:19.723 --> 00:59:23.660 region:rollup2
KIDS IN CARE AND THAT'S THE

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:26.096 region:rollup2
COUNTY WE HAVE TRULY EMBRACE ON

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.230 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CCR AND

00:59:26.096 --> 00:59:30.133 region:rollup2
PUT FRANKLY WE'VE DONE RATHER

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:32.035 region:rollup2
WELL SO FAR. WE WERE ONE OF THE

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.269 region:rollup2
EARLY RFA IMPLEMENTERS SO I'M

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:35.705 region:rollup2
GONNA.

00:59:32.269 --> 00:59:36.840 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE FOR THE ACRONYM UP.

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:38.809 region:rollup2
RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL SO

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.644 region:rollup2
BEASTLY STARTED WITH FOUR OTHER

00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:43.046 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND

00:59:40.644 --> 00:59:44.614 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY HAD A TWO YEAR HEAD

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:46.283 region:rollup2
START ABOVE.

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:48.185 region:rollup2
UP AHEAD OF OTHER COUNTIES WHICH

00:59:46.283 --> 00:59:49.419 region:rollup2
REALLY IS WHAT'S ALLOWING ME TO

00:59:48.185 --> 00:59:50.587 region:rollup2
SAY TODAY THAT FIFTY THREE

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:52.022 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR KIDS ARE PLACED

00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:54.624 region:rollup2
IN OUR FACE.

00:59:52.022 --> 00:59:55.358 region:rollup2
AND EVERY FORMER FOSTER HOME AND

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:57.894 region:rollup2
A RELATIVE.

00:59:55.358 --> 01:00:00.230 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO AN RFA

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:01.131 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT. PART OF OUR SUCCESS

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.666 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO THAT WE'VE

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.867 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:05.469 region:rollup2
ALLIANCE IN GROUP HOMES TWO

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:07.671 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO KINGS COUNTY HAD

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:09.439 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX KIDS IN GROUP HOMES

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:11.141 region:rollup2
AND TODAY WE HAVE SEVEN.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.843 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THE SUCCESS WAS

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:13.844 region:rollup2
REALLY THE NUMBER OF EFFORTS

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:16.113 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE.

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:17.447 region:rollup2
EMBRACE THE CALIFORNIA COURT

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:18.748 region:rollup2
PRACTICE MODEL WE HAVE

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:21.218 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED SAFETY ORGANIZED

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:22.586 region:rollup2
PRACTICE WHICH REALLY HAS GIVEN

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:23.120 region:rollup2
US A GOOD FOUNDATION ON THE SIDE

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:25.755 region:rollup2
OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.623 region:rollup2
MEETINGS. WE'VE IMPROVED OUR

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:29.359 region:rollup2
FAMILY FINDING AND.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:31.461 region:rollup2
IT WAS THERE ARE IF OUR IT WAS

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:32.329 region:rollup2
THE CCR RESOURCE OF VAPORS THAT

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.763 region:rollup2
REALLY ALLOWED FOR THAT.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:35.465 region:rollup2
AND WE WORKED WITH OUR LOCAL

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.700 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIGNIFICANTLY

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.034 region:rollup2
OVER THE PAST YEAR TO IMPROVE

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.736 region:rollup2
OUR APPS SERVICES.

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:40.904 region:rollup2
BUT DESPITE ALL OF THOSE

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:42.606 region:rollup2
SUCCESSES WE'VE.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:45.242 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:47.010 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING CCR

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:49.379 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THAT IS THAT WE

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.913 region:rollup2
STILL STRUGGLE WITH PLACEMENT OF

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:52.282 region:rollup2
ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF OUR

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:53.717 region:rollup2
POPULATION. WE HAVE OVER THE

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:55.619 region:rollup2
PAST YEAR AT ANY GIVEN TIME

01:00:53.717 --> 01:00:57.220 region:rollup2
SEVEN TO TEN KIDS IN GROUP HOMES

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:59.256 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO STEP

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.991 region:rollup2
DOWN. WE HAVE ABOUT TEN KIDS

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:03.026 region:rollup2
THAT ARE EITHER FREQUENT RUN

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:05.428 region:rollup2
RUNAWAYS OR A BALL AND ABOUT

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:05.829 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN KIDS THAT. IN OUR COUNTY

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:08.365 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:09.799 region:rollup2
WORKED THROUGH MULTIPLE MOVES

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:11.868 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE UNABLE TO PROVIDE

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:13.970 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT SERVICES TO STABILIZE

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:15.505 region:rollup2
AND THEIR CURRENT SETTING. AND

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:17.007 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS FOR A COUNTY REALLY

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.841 region:rollup2
IS THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:20.310 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.978 region:rollup2
WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:23.079 region:rollup2
AYE SFC HOMES AND I COUNTY OR

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.447 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOSTER CARE HOMES IN

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:25.782 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTY.

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:27.651 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:30.253 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES THEY HAVE A

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:30.954 region:rollup2
FEW BUT THEY'RE FULLY UTILIZED

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:33.757 region:rollup2
BY THOSE COUNTIES.

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:35.458 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:36.526 region:rollup2
NINE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES OUT

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:38.962 region:rollup2
OF GOTTEN TOGETHER TO REALLY

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:40.564 region:rollup2
LOOK AT AND WAY OUR NEEDS VERSUS

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:42.098 region:rollup2
OUR RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES TO

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:43.967 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE SERVICE HOMES. AND

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:45.402 region:rollup2
WE'VE COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATED

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:47.404 region:rollup2
NEED A FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:49.039 region:rollup2
HOMES AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:50.774 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SEVEN. SO WE HAVE

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.976 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR

01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:55.579 region:rollup2
NEEDS MET AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:57.814 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WHEN WE

01:01:55.579 --> 01:02:00.483 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT SUFFICIENT S. THE RTP

01:01:57.814 --> 01:02:02.218 region:rollup2
IS WHEN ABOUT THE SAME.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:05.322 region:rollup2
LEVEL SO ARE. IT WOULD WE HAVE

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:06.323 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE A

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.624 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT OPTIONS.

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:08.291 region:rollup2
PART OF IT IS FOR US BEEN KINGS

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:09.292 region:rollup2
COUNTY WE WERE TRYING TO PLACE A

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.560 region:rollup2
CHILD IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.494 region:rollup2
PLACE IN COUNTY WITH AN RFA. UP

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.129 region:rollup2
WE ARE LOOKING IMMEDIATELY TO

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:14.798 region:rollup2
FRESNO AND TULARE GROUP HOMES

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:17.300 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN OUR COUNTY WE DO NOT

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:19.169 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY STR TEEPEES AND HAVE

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.804 region:rollup2
ONLY A SINGLE GROUP HOME. WAIT

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:22.105 region:rollup2
THAT SERVES VERY SPECIALIZED

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:24.541 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:26.343 region:rollup2
AND A PART OF MY CONCERN REALLY

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:27.811 region:rollup2
IS WHAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO IS

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:29.646 region:rollup2
WHILE WE'RE DOING THIS REALLY IN

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:30.313 region:rollup2
A MULTIPLE LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION

01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:32.482 region:rollup2
OF.

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:34.851 region:rollup2
CCR DEBTS WAY BEYOND JUST THE

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:35.819 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT IS THAT AT THE MOMENT

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:38.855 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE SEARCHING FOR

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:39.990 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT WHERE PLACING KIDS IN

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.858 region:rollup2
UP HERE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.660 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENS M. IN THOSE

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:45.528 region:rollup2
INSTANCES IS WE REALLY THEN END

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:47.664 region:rollup2
UP WITH MULTIPLE PLACEMENTS

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:48.298 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THEN RE TRAUMATIZE. WE

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:50.767 region:rollup2
END UP.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:51.968 region:rollup2
REALLY DEFLATING ACCESS TO

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:53.470 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.838 region:rollup2
SERVICES BECAUSE WILL WE ARE

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:57.240 region:rollup2
MOVING KIDS CONSTANTLY THERE'S

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:59.075 region:rollup2
JUST NO THERE'S REALLY NO REAL.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.145 region:rollup2
CAPACITY TO KEEP THOSE SERVICES

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:05.548 region:rollup2
GOING SO DELAYS OF REUNIFICATION

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:07.717 region:rollup2
DELAYS CARE WE EXPOSE KIDS TO

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:09.953 region:rollup2
SELF HARM AND QUITE HONESTLY

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:11.921 region:rollup2
HAVE EXPOSED OUR SOCIAL WORKERS.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:13.523 region:rollup2
DID THE SAME THE NUMBER OF TIMES

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:17.193 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD A SOCIAL WORKER

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:20.697 region:rollup2
HEARD BY A CHILD. IS.

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:21.665 region:rollup2
WAIT HAS HAPPENED WAY TOO

01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:22.599 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY IN THE PAST YEAR.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.266 region:rollup2
AND WHILE I THINK OUR SOCIAL

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:23.833 region:rollup2
WORKERS ARE GREAT THEY REALLY DO

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.769 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE THE SKILL SET TO A

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:27.103 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:28.438 region:rollup2
UP PART OF THE OTHER ITEMS

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:30.340 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WE'VE ENCOUNTERED IS

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:32.309 region:rollup2
WHEN WE UTILIZE OUR A PHASE THAT

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.311 region:rollup2
REALLY STEP UP AND WANT TO HELP.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:35.512 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN THEY'RE NOT CAPABLE OF

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.347 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE OF AT PROVIDING

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.415 region:rollup2
THERAPEUTIC SERVICES WHERE THAN

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:39.916 region:rollup2
DESTROYING THAT RELATIONSHIP AS

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:41.017 region:rollup2
WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE REALIZING

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:43.853 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CANNOT.

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:45.322 region:rollup2
SERVE THE KIDS THE WAY THEY ARE.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:46.890 region:rollup2
YOU AND A STEP AWAY SO THEM LOSE

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:48.625 region:rollup2
A RESOURCE THAT OURS REALLY HARD

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.493 region:rollup2
TO FIND AND AND WE'VE WORKED

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:52.262 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO PUT THROUGH AND I

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.396 region:rollup2
THINK PROCESS.

AS ANY ONE OF US WOULD EVER

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.503 region:rollup2

THE FOUNDATION FOR EXPECTING

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:37.013 region:rollup2

AND THEN LASTLY.

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:55.625 region:rollup2
AND PROBABLY AN AREA OF A LOT

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.292 region:rollup2
OF.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.760 region:rollup2

ARE AVAILABLE TO US SO. THAT'S A

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:19.315 region:rollup2
BIG AREA OF LEARNING HOW TO

DOCUMENT AND AND DO THINGS THAT

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.951 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW AND IN SOME CASES MUCH

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:25.254 region:rollup2
MORE BUREAUCRATIC THAN WHAT WE

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:32.228 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FOR US TO MAXIMIZE THE

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.762 region:rollup2
EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN DRAW DOWN

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.129 region:rollup2

WITHIN THIS CONTEXT

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:19.208 region:rollup2

TROUBLESHOOT IN. VERY EARNESTLY

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:22.678 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT SOMETIMES.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:24.046 region:rollup2
ARISE AND CONTINUE TO RISE I'M

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:25.548 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES DAILY.

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:27.650 region:rollup2
ABOUT THINGS WE HEAR ARE GOING

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:28.684 region:rollup2
WELL OR NOT SO WELL IN COUNTIES

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:30.119 region:rollup2
AND REALLY TRYING TO SOLVE THOSE

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:31.154 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS RATHER THAN TAKE A

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.789 region:rollup2
PUNITIVE APPROACH.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:35.591 region:rollup2
IS REALLY KIND OF UNPRECEDENTED

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:37.493 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO THINK THAT IN TERMS

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:38.361 region:rollup2
OF CHALLENGES WE NEED TO YOU

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:40.062 region:rollup2
KNOW IN ADDITION TO THOSE THAT

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:41.564 region:rollup2
YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT FROM THE

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:43.032 region:rollup2
CHILD WELFARE AND PERSPECTIVE.

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:44.167 region:rollup2
.

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:45.501 region:rollup2
BUDGETING AND PLANNING FOR THIS

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:47.136 region:rollup2
FOR MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IS

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:48.671 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.072 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT THE PLACERS OF

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.607 region:rollup2
CHILDREN INTO THE SETTINGS

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:53.075 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE ARE THE SERVICE

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:55.077 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WANTS THOSE PLACEMENTS

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:57.180 region:rollup2
OCCUR. AND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:58.948 region:rollup2
QUITE SURE HOW MANY OF THESE

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.384 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:02.952 region:rollup2

WILL END UP BEING RECRUITED.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:06.689 region:rollup2
IT'S UNCERTAIN YET HAS TO THE

01:12:04.954 --> 01:12:08.457 region:rollup2
VOLUME OF SPECIALTY MENTAL

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.759 region:rollup2
HEALTH THAT WILL COME ALONG WITH

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.793 region:rollup2
THOSE TYPES OF PLACEMENTS BEING

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:12.628 region:rollup2
UTILIZED.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:13.262 region:rollup2
ANDADDITIONALLY I WOULD JUST

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:16.065 region:rollup2
SAY THERE ARE.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:18.301 region:rollup2
ALREADY EXISTING CHALLENGES ON

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:20.102 region:rollup2
TOP OF WHICH CECE ARE OPERATES

01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:21.704 region:rollup2
SO AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:23.039 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:25.875 region:rollup2
MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:27.476 region:rollup2
CCR WILL BE IMPACTED BY NOTABLY

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.544 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:29.912 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY FOR SOCIAL WORKERS IN

STANDARD FOR WHAT'S CONSIDERED

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:58.074 region:rollup2
TIMELY AND WILL BE STARTING TO

TRACK HOW COUNTIES ARE DOING IN

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:01.644 region:rollup2
THEIR PROVIDERS ARE DOING AND.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:03.679 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES AND

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:05.181 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND AND

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:06.682 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT THEY ADDRESS THAT

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:08.584 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SEE THAT THERE ARE.

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:09.785 region:rollup2
SHORTFALLS AND HOW QUICKLY

OUR PARTNERS EXPERIENCE A

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:21.397 region:rollup2
COUNTY BY COUNTY SIDE OF

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:24.133 region:rollup2
VARIATIONS.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:26.569 region:rollup2
IS ALSO A CHALLENGE WERE WERE

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:28.437 region:rollup2
READY TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:31.307 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THERE CERTAINLY

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:33.009 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS THAT SHOULD FALL ON

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:34.844 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE COUNTY MENTAL

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:37.680 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN THAT WE. CERTAINLY

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:40.483 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BUT THE REALITIES OF

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.152 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WORKFORCE SHORTAGES

01:13:40.483 --> 01:13:46.355 region:rollup2
AND JUST PHYSICAL LOCATION.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:48.124 region:rollup2
DO SOMETIMES LEND THEMSELVES TO

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:51.360 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE.

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:53.829 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES FROM ONE COUNTY TO

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.599 region:rollup2
THE NEXT AS TO HOW QUICKLY YOU

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:59.602 region:rollup2
CAN GET CARE AND FOR EXAMPLE

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:02.972 region:rollup2
WHAT CREATIVE MODELS AND THEY

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:06.575 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE VOLUNTARILY PUT IN

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:08.477 region:rollup2
PLACE WHERE AS OTHERS HAD NOT.

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:09.045 region:rollup2
FOUND.

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:09.745 region:rollup2
AND THEN I THINK WE'RE STILL

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:10.446 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.080 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IN THE LINKAGES THAT WE

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.348 region:rollup2
HOPE OCCUR WHEN A CHILD WELFARE

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.649 region:rollup2

COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND WHAT

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:21.023 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AT THAT POINT WE KNOW

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:23.159 region:rollup2
THAT SOME

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:24.994 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE ENGAGEMENT. A LACK OF

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:26.162 region:rollup2
CULTURAL COMPETENCY FOR THAT

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:27.897 region:rollup2
CHILD'S WAS THAT STIGMA ON THE

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:29.699 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CHILD'S CAREGIVER

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:31.634 region:rollup2
AND NOT REALLY WANTING. THEM TO

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:33.002 region:rollup2
BE IDENTIFIED AS SOMEONE WHO

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.603 region:rollup2
NEEDS EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THERE'S

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:37.273 region:rollup2
ANY NUMBER OF OF REASONS.

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:39.141 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN A

01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:39.675 region:rollup2
BREAKDOWN SO WERE TRYING TO LEAN

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.711 region:rollup2
IN.

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:42.678 region:rollup2
AND RATHER THAN DEFEND AND TRY

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:45.247 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THINGS DON'T

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:46.682 region:rollup2
GO WELL HOW CAN WE PREVENT THOSE

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:48.651 region:rollup2
THINGS FROM HAPPENING AN EAGLE

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:50.386 region:rollup2

UP AND THAT THE CHILD'S

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.484 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN THE CHILD WELFARE

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:22.051 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS

01:15:21.484 --> 01:15:23.219 region:rollup2
PARLOR NEXT WILL HAVE MISSED

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:25.588 region:rollup2
FORT.

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:27.223 region:rollup2
GREAT.

01:15:25.588 --> 01:15:28.624 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:29.658 region:rollup2
ANGIE SHORTS WITH THE ALLIANCE

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.726 region:rollup2
FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS.

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:32.261 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:33.796 region:rollup2
CONTINUUM OF CARE IS TO MEET THE

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.598 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN THEIR FIRST

01:15:33.796 --> 01:15:37.199 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:39.502 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:41.237 region:rollup2
HOME IN ORDER TO GET APPROPRIATE

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:42.338 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND SERVICES.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:43.906 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THE

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:46.108 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:47.843 region:rollup2
HAVE TAKEN CRITICAL STOPS

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:49.145 region:rollup2
TO FIX OUR BROKEN RATE SYSTEM.

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:51.580 region:rollup2
CHILDREN PLACED WITH RELATIVES

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:53.315 region:rollup2
NOW HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO FUNDING

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.550 region:rollup2
AS NON RELATIVES.

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:56.385 region:rollup2
AND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.053 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TIERED RATE

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.622 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TIED TO THE NEEDS OF THE

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:02.291 region:rollup2
CHILD.

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:03.459 region:rollup2
AND TO BE CLEAR WE FULLY SUPPORT

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:05.761 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT TIERED

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:07.430 region:rollup2
RATE SYSTEM IT IS EXACTLY THE

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:09.698 region:rollup2
WORK WE SHOULD BE DOING.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:11.534 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THE PROTOCOL THAT

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:14.070 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETERMINE

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:15.671 region:rollup2
THE CHILD'S TEAR. HAS NEVER BEEN

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.406 region:rollup2
PILOTED OR STUDIED TO DETERMINE

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:19.074 region:rollup2
ITS ACCURACY.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.810 region:rollup2
AND YET AT THIS POINT IT APPEARS

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:23.546 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO PLAN TO DELAY

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:25.714 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION BEYOND

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:28.384 region:rollup2
MAY FIRST THE ONLY THING WE KNOW

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:29.018 region:rollup2
FROM A LIMITED STUDY. TO

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:29.985 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:32.188 region:rollup2
YOUTH ACROSS THE DIFFERENT

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:34.557 region:rollup2
LEVELS IS THAT ONLY ONE PERCENT

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:35.858 region:rollup2
OF YOU SCORED A LEVEL FOR THE

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:37.126 region:rollup2
HIGHEST OF THE BASIC LEVELS.

01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:39.061 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:40.830 region:rollup2
RIGHT ONE PERCENT AND WE DON'T

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:41.897 region:rollup2
KNOW IF MORE THAN ONE PERCENT OF

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:43.833 region:rollup2
YOUTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN SCORED

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:46.001 region:rollup2
AND LEVEL FOR. WE DON'T KNOW IF

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:47.436 region:rollup2
THE PROTOCOL CONSISTENTLY SCORES

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:49.472 region:rollup2
YOUTH WITH HIGHER NEEDS IN THE

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.840 region:rollup2
HIGHER LEVELS WE DON'T KNOW IF

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:52.942 region:rollup2
YOU'D STEPPING DOWN FROM GROUP

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:54.009 region:rollup2
HOME SCORING TO HIGHER LEVELS.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:56.178 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:59.014 region:rollup2
BEEN NO ATTEMPT TO ASSESS THE

01:16:56.178 --> 01:17:00.149 region:rollup2
ACCURACY OF THE TOOL OR WHETHER

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:01.750 region:rollup2
OR NOT IT'S WAITED PROPERLY.

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:04.153 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:05.387 region:rollup2
TOOLS RELIABILITY CDSS CONDUCTED

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:07.389 region:rollup2
A VERY LIMITED STUDY OF

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:08.724 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY WERE THIRTEEN CASES

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:10.960 region:rollup2
WERE SCORED.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:11.727 region:rollup2
BY TWO DIFFERENT WORKERS AND IT

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.729 region:rollup2
REVEALED THAT THE SAME CHILD WHO

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:15.631 region:rollup2
SCORED A DIFFERENT LEVEL FORTY

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:17.233 region:rollup2
SIX PERCENT OF THE TIME. THEY

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.000 region:rollup2
GIVE ME A LITTLE CONFIDENCE.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.502 region:rollup2
FINALLY COUNTIES ARE BEING

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.870 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO CHANGE THEIR

01:17:19.502 --> 01:17:23.105 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE PLANS BUT

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:24.440 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CONFORM THE

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:26.308 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE PLANTS TO THE

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.777 region:rollup2
NEW LEVEL OF CARE SYSTEM IS NOT

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.979 region:rollup2
FINALIZED. AND NO COUNTY IS

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:32.848 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE READY TO IMPLEMENT

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:34.550 region:rollup2
BY MAY FIRST AND WE NEED ALL OF

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:35.918 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTIES TO BE READY TO GO

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:37.753 region:rollup2
WITH NEW PLANS BEFORE WE

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:40.422 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT BECAUSE CHILDREN MOVE

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:42.124 region:rollup2
ACROSS COUNTY LINES. SO WE CAN'T

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.392 region:rollup2
BE A TIERED LIKE SOME COUNTIES

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:45.227 region:rollup2
CAN BE READY WHILE OTHER

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:47.163 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE NOT READY. GIVEN

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS IN JANUARY CDSS

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:50.132 region:rollup2
AGREED TO DELAY STATEWIDE

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:52.034 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WHICH HAD BEEN

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:52.801 region:rollup2
SET TO TAKE EFFECT ON FEBRUARY

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:55.271 region:rollup2
FIRST.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:57.106 region:rollup2
INTEL MAY AND TO STUDY BOTH THE

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:59.441 region:rollup2
ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF THE

01:17:57.106 --> 01:18:00.676 region:rollup2
TOOL BY ROLLING IT OUT IN FOSTER

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:02.545 region:rollup2
FAMILY AGENCY HOMES IN MARCH AND

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:03.379 region:rollup2
APRIL.

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:05.080 region:rollup2
AFTER PHASE ARE THE PERFECT

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:06.282 region:rollup2
PLACE TO TEST THE TOOL BECAUSE

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.750 region:rollup2
THOSE HOMES DON'T GET

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:08.884 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:10.853 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THAT MAY ONE DEADLINE

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:12.421 region:rollup2
HAS PROVEN TO AGGRESSIVE DESPITE

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:15.224 region:rollup2
PROMISING TO ASSESS BOTH

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:17.092 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY THE

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:19.094 region:rollup2
STUDY UNDER WAY IS ONLY LOOKING

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:20.095 region:rollup2
AT THE RELIABILITY OF THE TOOL.

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:21.997 region:rollup2
THERE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:24.900 region:rollup2
TO DO THE MOST THE MORE ROBUST

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:27.336 region:rollup2
STUDY OF THE TOOLS VALIDITY.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.238 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:30.406 region:rollup2
THE TOOL IS FULLY TESTED AND

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:32.541 region:rollup2
BEFORE ALL COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:34.910 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE PLANS IN PLACE

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:37.179 region:rollup2
WILL RESULT IN BACKLOG DELAY

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:38.914 region:rollup2
ERRONEOUS ASSESSMENTS PLACEMENT

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:40.449 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIONS AND STRESS ON OUR

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:41.217 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.985 region:rollup2
OUR FAMILIES CARE FOR REAL

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:45.020 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN REAL TIME AND NEED

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:47.289 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON ACCURATE

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.224 region:rollup2
AND RELIABLE RATES TO DECIDE SO.

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:49.158 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING THAT THE

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:50.459 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:51.894 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO DELAY

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:54.096 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.598 region:rollup2
INTEL IT'S TESTED FOR VALIDITY

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:56.832 region:rollup2
AND RELIABILITY UNTIL

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:58.801 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE CHANGES HAVE BEEN

01:18:56.832 --> 01:19:00.235 region:rollup2
MADE AND COUNTIES HAVE TIME TO

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:00.703 region:rollup2
TRAIN AND PROP STAFF ON THE NEW

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:02.371 region:rollup2
PROTOCOLS ONCE THEY'RE

01:19:00.703 --> 01:19:03.472 region:rollup2
FINALIZED.

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:06.642 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION OF

THROUGH ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TEN.

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:33.135 region:rollup2
I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW CRITICAL

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:34.703 region:rollup2
FUNDING SUPPORT AND SERVICES ARE

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:36.972 region:rollup2
FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE.

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:38.440 region:rollup2
UNABLE SIX TWENTY SEVENTEEN I

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:40.242 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY DAUGHTER

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.443 region:rollup2
THE CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:43.479 region:rollup2
HAD MY GRANDSON AND THEY WERE

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:44.446 region:rollup2
BRINGING HIM TO ME. A FEW WEEKS

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:45.681 region:rollup2
LATER HE WAS FINALLY PLACE IN MY

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:47.716 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:49.618 region:rollup2
AT THAT MOMENT I STARTED WORKING

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:50.686 region:rollup2
TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING AND

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.186 region:rollup2
OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:54.490 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:56.058 region:rollup2
I WAS CONCERNED THAT IF I DID

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:58.360 region:rollup2
NOT FINISH IN NINETY DAYS AS I

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:59.294 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TOLD I WOULD NOT BE

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.163 region:rollup2
APPROVED AND SO I DID EVERYTHING

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.598 region:rollup2
I DID. EVERYTHING I COULD

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:04.233 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO GET APPROVED A

SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:06.769 region:rollup2
STILL IT TOOK MUCH LONGER THAN

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:08.137 region:rollup2
NINETY DAYS TO GET THROUGH THE

01:20:06.769 --> 01:20:09.772 region:rollup2
PROCESS

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:11.674 region:rollup2
THE RFA PROCESS IS COMPLICATED

01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:14.076 region:rollup2
AND CONFUSING.

01:20:11.674 --> 01:20:15.878 region:rollup2
I WAS ULTIMATELY APPROVED

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:18.013 region:rollup2
ON OCTOBER TENTH TWENTY

SEVENTEEN THAT WAS A FULL SIX

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:20.516 region:rollup2
MONTHS AFTER STARTING THE

01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:22.051 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:24.720 region:rollup2
AND I FINALLY STARTED RECEIVING

01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:27.022 region:rollup2

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.589 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ONE MONTH THE FOR MY

NOT RECEIVING FINANCIAL

ASSISTANCE FOR SEVEN MONTHS

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.431 region:rollup2
WHILE CARING FOR MY GRANDSON WAS

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:37.533 region:rollup2
VERY HARD ON ME.

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:39.401 region:rollup2
I AM BLESSED I HAVE FAMILY

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:41.670 region:rollup2

BUT EVEN WITH THAT HELP I

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:50.512 region:rollup2
STRUGGLED

01:20:47.743 --> 01:20:52.715 region:rollup2
I AM AN HOURLY EMPLOYEE SO EVERY

WORKER.

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:05.320 region:rollup2
BUT MOST OF MY FAMILIES AND

01:27:03.652 --> 01:27:07.189 region:rollup2
FRIENDS WOULD USUALLY BE CUT BE

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.557 region:rollup2

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:10.225 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS ROLE IN A DANGEROUS

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:11.593 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:13.729 region:rollup2
FOR ME IT WAS IN A DANGEROUS

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:15.697 region:rollup2
JOB JUST BECAUSE I LOVE THE KEY

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:17.733 region:rollup2
IT SO MUCH AND I REALLY PUT A

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:21.369 region:rollup2
LOT OF LOVING CARE TO WHAT I DO.

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:22.938 region:rollup2
BUT I DO REMEMBER A STORY OF A

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:24.873 region:rollup2
CHILD NAMED LITTLE TEA AT WHICH

01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:26.208 region:rollup2
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:27.309 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS I HAD EVER BEEN IN MY

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:29.945 region:rollup2
LIFE.

01:27:27.309 --> 01:27:31.379 region:rollup2
IT WAS A REFERRAL FOR DOMESTIC

01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:32.814 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:35.083 region:rollup2
RESPONSE REFERRAL.

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:36.318 region:rollup2
IN WHICH A NEIGHBORHOOD JUST

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:37.819 region:rollup2
CAUGHT IN A NON AS WE HAVE SAID

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:39.154 region:rollup2
THAT THE MOTHER WAS BEING BE.

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:41.590 region:rollup2
ANY DOES A ONE SENTENCE ON THE

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:43.125 region:rollup2
REFERRAL THE MOTHER IS BEING

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.259 region:rollup2
BEAT AND I HAD TO ADDRESS.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:46.228 region:rollup2
SO WHEN I RESPONDED TO THE AT

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:47.496 region:rollup2
HOME I INTERVIEWED LITTLE T. WHO

01:27:46.228 --> 01:27:48.897 region:rollup2
WAS NINE YEARS SO.

01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:50.699 region:rollup2
AND HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT MY

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:52.167 region:rollup2
FATHER GETS OUT OF JAIL HE'S

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:53.568 region:rollup2
GOING TO BEAT UP MY MOTHER'S

01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:55.637 region:rollup2
BOYFRIEND AND I SAY WELL WHY

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:57.305 region:rollup2
WOULD HE DO THAT. ANY SAID

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:58.740 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MY MOTHER IS BEING BEAT

01:27:57.305 --> 01:28:00.408 region:rollup2
EVERY NIGHT.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.543 region:rollup2
AND HE SAID ANDTHERE'S NOTHING

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:03.178 region:rollup2
I CAN DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M

01:28:01.543 --> 01:28:05.113 region:rollup2
TOO LITTLE.

01:28:03.178 --> 01:28:06.982 region:rollup2
AND SO I SPOKE TO THE MOM AND I

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:07.449 region:rollup2
SPOKE TO THE BOYFRIEND AND IN

01:28:06.982 --> 01:28:09.985 region:rollup2
THAT ENVIRONMENT I WAS

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:12.254 region:rollup2
TERRIFIED.

01:28:09.985 --> 01:28:13.421 region:rollup2
I CAN'T REALLY DESCRIBE JUST

01:28:12.254 --> 01:28:15.557 region:rollup2
THE BOYFRIENDS AGGRESSION

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:16.525 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE MOM AND THE BEHAVIOR

01:28:15.557 --> 01:28:18.493 region:rollup2
AND I WAS THERE BY MYSELF I

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:18.994 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE THE POLICE.

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:20.929 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:28:18.994 --> 01:28:22.164 region:rollup2
EVEN EVEN THOUGH APARTMENT

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:23.231 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORS WERE RUNNING THROUGH

01:28:22.164 --> 01:28:25.734 region:rollup2
ME SAYING PLEASE HELP THIS

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:27.736 region:rollup2
LITTLE BOY BECAUSE HE SOMETIMES

KNOCKED OUT BY THE BOYFRIEND.

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:41.850 region:rollup2
AND SO BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:43.585 region:rollup2
EXIGENCY TO REMOVE THAT SHOUT IN

01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:45.687 region:rollup2
THAT SITUATION BECAUSE DANGER

01:28:43.585 --> 01:28:47.322 region:rollup2
WAS NOT HAPPEN AT THAT MOMENT

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.623 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH I FELT A FREE. I'M I

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:50.392 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD TO GET A WARRANT

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:51.693 region:rollup2
REMOVAL ORDER TO COME BACK WITH

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:53.728 region:rollup2
THE POLICE.

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:55.363 region:rollup2
IT'S REMOVED THIS CHILD.

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:57.098 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY HAD A INTER WITH ME

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:58.867 region:rollup2
ALSO SO THAT IT CAN BE A

01:28:57.098 --> 01:29:00.602 region:rollup2
LEARNING EXPERIENCE WITH HER AND

01:28:58.867 --> 01:29:01.870 region:rollup2
I HAVE ONE LAW WHOM I HAD A

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:03.305 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER WITH ME.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:05.574 region:rollup2
THE BOYFRIEND JUMPED OUT OF A

01:29:03.305 --> 01:29:07.442 region:rollup2
TWO STORY WINDOW WHEN HE'S HEARD

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:09.244 region:rollup2
THE POLICE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR.

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:11.246 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE

01:29:09.244 --> 01:29:12.547 region:rollup2
APARTMENT THE MOM WAS ALREADY

01:29:11.246 --> 01:29:13.882 region:rollup2
PACKING THE CHILD'S BANKS

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:15.417 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAUGHT

01:29:13.882 --> 01:29:17.118 region:rollup2
TOLD HER THAT WE WERE COMING TO

01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:19.521 region:rollup2
TAKE HER SON.

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:21.323 region:rollup2
WHEN I SPOKE THE WORDS THAT I AM

01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:22.757 region:rollup2
REMOVING YOU FROM YOUR MOTHER

01:29:21.323 --> 01:29:24.626 region:rollup2
AND YOUR GOING TO BE PLACED IN A

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:27.028 region:rollup2
FOSTER HOME.

01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:28.964 region:rollup2
THIS CHILD SCREAMS SO LOUD NO

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:30.365 region:rollup2
SOUND CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

01:29:28.964 --> 01:29:32.033 region:rollup2
I WILL NEVER FORGET IT HIS HEART

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:34.269 region:rollup2
BROKE.

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:36.671 region:rollup2
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

01:29:34.269 --> 01:29:38.740 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOOK BACK AT MY INTERN

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:40.008 region:rollup2
SHE WAS IN TEARS.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:42.110 region:rollup2
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:29:40.008 --> 01:29:43.778 region:rollup2
THE POLICE OFFICER THAT WAS

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:44.679 region:rollup2
WITH ME ACTUALLY STEPPED OUT OF

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:46.214 region:rollup2
THE HOME BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:48.149 region:rollup2
CRYING.

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:51.353 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE POLICE OFFICER.

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:53.154 region:rollup2
I COULD NOT CRY AND I TOLD

01:29:51.353 --> 01:29:55.657 region:rollup2
MYSELF NOT TO CRY.

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:57.325 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THAT TIME I HAVE TO

01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:58.493 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE CHILD WITH THE

01:29:57.325 --> 01:30:00.195 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT HE NEEDED IN THE

01:29:58.493 --> 01:30:01.363 region:rollup2
COMPASSIONATE HE NEEDED I

01:30:00.195 --> 01:30:05.133 region:rollup2
COULDN'T BREAK DOWN MYSELF.

01:30:01.363 --> 01:30:06.334 region:rollup2
THE MOTHER HAD NO AFFECT.

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:07.402 region:rollup2
HE GAVE ME HIS CLOTHES SHE DID

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:08.603 region:rollup2
NOT HURT HIM SHE DID NOT KISS

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:09.838 region:rollup2
HIM.

01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:10.405 region:rollup2
SHE DID NOT TAKE THE FOSTER

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:12.741 region:rollup2
PARENTS PHONE NUMBER TO CALL

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:14.843 region:rollup2
HIM.

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:16.278 region:rollup2
AFTER I REMOVED HIM SHE NEVER

01:30:14.843 --> 01:30:17.979 region:rollup2
SHOWED UP TO COURT.

01:30:16.278 --> 01:30:19.481 region:rollup2
SHE DID SHOW UP TO OUR OFFICE

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:20.548 region:rollup2
AND AFTER WE HAD LEFT THE

01:30:19.481 --> 01:30:22.884 region:rollup2
BOYFRIEND CAME BACK AND

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:24.052 region:rollup2
SPLITTERS GOLD OPEN.

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:26.187 region:rollup2
SO SHE HAS STITCHES ALL IN HER

01:30:24.052 --> 01:30:27.656 region:rollup2
SCALP.

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:29.491 region:rollup2
THEY SHOUT AT THE GO TO COURT

01:30:27.656 --> 01:30:31.159 region:rollup2
FOR SIX MONTHS.

01:30:29.491 --> 01:30:33.161 region:rollup2
AND EVERYTIME HE WENT TO COURT

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:35.563 region:rollup2
HIS MOTHER WASN'T THERE.

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:37.332 region:rollup2
TO SAY THE LEAST.

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:39.634 region:rollup2
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME EVERY

01:30:37.332 --> 01:30:41.336 region:rollup2
DAY IN MY AGENCY.

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:43.204 region:rollup2
AND IS THE IMPACT

01:30:41.336 --> 01:30:45.273 region:rollup2
LAST MONTH JUST THE MARCH OF TWO

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:47.142 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. EIGHT HUNDRED

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:48.777 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WERE DETAINED FROM

01:30:47.142 --> 01:30:49.878 region:rollup2
THEIR PARENTS CUSTODY IN LA

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:52.180 region:rollup2
COUNTY ALONE.

01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:53.014 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED.

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.350 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH WITH THE SHOT WENT

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:57.052 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:59.120 region:rollup2
SO I SAY THAT AND I GIVE S. THE

01:30:57.052 --> 01:31:00.922 region:rollup2
WORRY JUST BECAUSE THESE KIDS

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.724 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SO TRAUMATIZED FOR A

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:04.159 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF REASONS.

01:31:02.724 --> 01:31:06.895 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUBSTANCE

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:09.364 region:rollup2
ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:10.131 region:rollup2
THEY NEED SO MUCH CARE THEY NEED

01:31:09.364 --> 01:31:12.367 region:rollup2
SO MUCH SUPPORT.

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:13.768 region:rollup2
THERAPY.

01:31:12.367 --> 01:31:15.670 region:rollup2
ARMED MENTORS

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:17.305 region:rollup2
CEO OF TEAS

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:18.907 region:rollup2
IT TAKES SO MUCH TO GET THEM IN

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:21.009 region:rollup2
A PLACE TO WEAR THEIR STABLE I

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:22.410 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THEM LIKE THE SHOUT

01:31:21.009 --> 01:31:23.778 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY HE ENDED UP IN THE

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.612 region:rollup2
PROBATION SYSTEM.

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:26.514 region:rollup2
AND THEN ENDED UP IN THE PRISON

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:27.615 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:29.117 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE JUST COULD NOT YOU

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:31.052 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:31:29.117 --> 01:31:33.722 region:rollup2
RECOVER FROM THE TRAUMA THAT HE

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:34.756 region:rollup2
HAD EXPERIENCE AND ABANDONMENT.

01:31:33.722 --> 01:31:36.324 region:rollup2
AND I ALWAYS THINK BACK TO HIS

01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:37.926 region:rollup2
SCREEN.

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:39.828 region:rollup2
SCREEN WASN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:41.863 region:rollup2
ME TAKING HIM.

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:43.198 region:rollup2
HIS SCREAM WAS ABOUT.

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:44.499 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THE HE HAD BEEN

01:31:43.198 --> 01:31:46.101 region:rollup2
THROUGH HIS LIFE THEY LEAD UP TO

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:47.969 region:rollup2
ME TAKING HIM.

01:31:46.101 --> 01:31:49.070 region:rollup2
HE HAD HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:51.206 region:rollup2
MOTHER BEING ABUSED ALL THAT

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:52.574 region:rollup2
TIME AND THIS WAS LIKE THE FINAL

01:31:51.206 --> 01:31:55.076 region:rollup2
BLOW NOW YOU'RE BEING REMOVED

01:32:34.082 --> 01:32:37.485 region:rollup2
SHOW UP TO COURT WHEN THE PARENT

01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:39.721 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SHOW UP TO COURT.

IN THE POLICY WORLD.

01:33:47.889 --> 01:34:03.338 region:rollup2
I THINK IT.

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:04.839 region:rollup2
I'M GOING.

01:34:03.338 --> 01:34:07.375 region:rollup2

I'M WE ADVOCATE TO TRANSFORM THE

01:34:17.085 --> 01:34:19.554 region:rollup2
JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CHILD

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.889 region:rollup2
WELFARE SYSTEMS THAT ALL

01:34:19.554 --> 01:34:22.857 region:rollup2
CHILDREN CAN THRIVE.

01:34:20.889 --> 01:34:23.725 region:rollup2
AND I DO WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:25.627 region:rollup2
FOR A MINUTE.

01:34:23.725 --> 01:34:27.529 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THE WHAT THE

01:34:25.627 --> 01:34:29.130 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS SAY. ON BECAUSE I DO

01:34:27.529 --> 01:34:30.798 region:rollup2
THINK WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:31.432 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD TO REMEMBER WHY WE'RE

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:33.735 region:rollup2
DOING THIS.

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:35.036 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO JUST DO A

01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:36.571 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF SHORT QUOTES FROM THE

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:38.873 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON GROUP

01:34:36.571 --> 01:34:40.441 region:rollup2
CARE FOR CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:43.211 region:rollup2
WHICH CAME OUT OF THE AMERICAN

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:44.879 region:rollup2
ORTHO PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION.

01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:46.648 region:rollup2
I'M IN THE FIRST QUOTE IS.

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:49.350 region:rollup2
GROUP SETTINGS SHOULD NOT BE

01:34:46.648 --> 01:34:50.752 region:rollup2
USED AS LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:52.787 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIRINHERENTLY

01:34:50.752 --> 01:34:54.255 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:58.326 region:rollup2
HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN.

01:34:54.255 --> 01:35:00.028 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF AGE.

01:34:58.326 --> 01:35:01.062 region:rollup2
I'M AND THE SECOND ONE IS

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:02.630 region:rollup2
HEALTHY ATTACHMENTS WITH THE

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:04.365 region:rollup2
PARENT FIGURE.

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:06.301 region:rollup2
ARE NECESSARY FOR CHILDREN OF

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:07.869 region:rollup2
ALL AGES AND HELP TO REDUCE

01:35:06.301 --> 01:35:11.105 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BEHAVIORS AND

01:35:07.869 --> 01:35:13.741 region:rollup2
INTERPERSONAL DIFFICULTIES.

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:14.776 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD ONE IS GROUP CARE

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:16.344 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:18.379 region:rollup2
THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT IN

01:35:16.344 --> 01:35:19.781 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. ONLY WHEN CLINICALLY

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:22.050 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

01:35:19.781 --> 01:35:23.117 region:rollup2
AND THE GOAL SHOULD BE.

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:24.919 region:rollup2
RETURN TO FAMILIES AS SOON AS

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:27.221 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:28.623 region:rollup2
SO I I JUST WANTED TO GROUND US

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:30.225 region:rollup2
IN THAT RESEARCH BECAUSE I THINK

01:35:28.623 --> 01:35:32.193 region:rollup2
THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT CCR

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:33.962 region:rollup2
IS ALL ABOUT.

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:37.065 region:rollup2
I AM AND THE OTHER THING I

01:35:33.962 --> 01:35:39.100 region:rollup2
WANTED TO SAY IS THAT I'M.

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:41.202 region:rollup2
CCR IS.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:42.670 region:rollup2
IS A MAJOR REFORM AND AND WE'VE

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:44.038 region:rollup2
BEEN UNDERTAKING AT FOR SEVERAL

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:45.773 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:47.942 region:rollup2
EXISTING PRACTICE HAS BEEN IN

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:50.378 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:52.113 region:rollup2
IT'S HUGE CULTURE CHANGE AND WE

01:35:50.378 --> 01:35:54.382 region:rollup2
NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:54.782 region:rollup2
AND YET.

01:35:54.382 --> 01:35:56.484 region:rollup2
WE KNOW.

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:59.220 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN GO BACK

01:35:56.484 --> 01:36:01.122 region:rollup2
THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF.

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:03.491 region:rollup2
OF THE SYSTEM THE WAY IT WAS ARE

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:04.993 region:rollup2
JUST TOO GREAT.

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:07.629 region:rollup2
I AM AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO TO

01:36:04.993 --> 01:36:09.664 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THAT. AMONG THE HARMS

01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:11.165 region:rollup2
OF GROUP CARE. AND ARE THE

01:36:09.664 --> 01:36:12.767 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY CALLS TO LAW

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:14.202 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT THAT LEAD TO

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:15.837 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC CONTACT WITH THE

01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:17.605 region:rollup2
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT

01:36:15.837 --> 01:36:21.843 region:rollup2
CRIMINALIZE ABUSE AND NEGLECT OF

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:24.178 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:36:21.843 --> 01:36:27.482 region:rollup2
SO. NOW THAT WE'RE IN THE

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:29.117 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF CCR WE CAN SEE THAT

01:36:27.482 --> 01:36:31.052 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO COST MORE.

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:33.121 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE TIME

01:36:31.052 --> 01:36:34.122 region:rollup2
THAN WE ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED.

01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:37.792 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S WORTH IT TO GET IT

01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:39.460 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:41.262 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE ISSUES RELATED TO

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:42.597 region:rollup2
SEE SEE ARE SO COMPLEX

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:44.132 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FACE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:45.700 region:rollup2
CHANGES SOON.

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:47.402 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.403 region:rollup2
AS WE FORGE AHEAD.

01:36:47.402 --> 01:36:50.038 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO PUT SOME

01:36:48.403 --> 01:36:51.773 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE IN THE

01:36:50.038 --> 01:36:54.108 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM.

01:36:51.773 --> 01:36:56.611 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS THAT MAYBE INTERIM.

01:36:54.108 --> 01:36:59.013 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:36:56.611 --> 01:37:00.114 region:rollup2
AND AND BUILD SOLID PERFORMANCE

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:01.149 region:rollup2
MEASURES AND I WANT TO TALK

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:01.649 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:04.118 region:rollup2
FOR A MINUTE.

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:04.852 region:rollup2
.

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:06.054 region:rollup2
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:08.956 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE

01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:10.224 region:rollup2
CONVERSION TO STR TEEPEES.

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:11.726 region:rollup2
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THOSE

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.593 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE AT THE

01:37:11.726 --> 01:37:13.828 region:rollup2
HEART OF WHAT WE WANT TO

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:15.963 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH.

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:16.998 region:rollup2
THROUGH CCR.

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:18.599 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE BASIS FOR

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:19.634 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:21.002 region:rollup2
AS WE GO THROUGH THE CONVERSION

01:37:19.634 --> 01:37:22.303 region:rollup2
PROCESS

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:24.839 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:26.507 region:rollup2
GROUND THE LEVEL OF CARE SYSTEM

01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:28.976 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:31.346 region:rollup2
I'M SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE THAT.

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:33.381 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S NEEDS ARE MET.

01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:35.817 region:rollup2
I AM.

01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:38.686 region:rollup2
SO WHATEVER IS IMPLEMENTED NOW

01:37:35.817 --> 01:37:40.688 region:rollup2
AS AN INTERIM. MEASURE.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:42.924 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE REVISITED

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:44.225 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ALIGNED

01:37:42.924 --> 01:37:45.560 region:rollup2
WITH THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:46.961 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ARE DEVELOPED WE

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.129 region:rollup2
REALLY FEEL LIKE. PERFORMANCE

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:50.565 region:rollup2
MEASURES IN SOME WAYS SHOULD BE

01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:51.099 region:rollup2
DONE FIRST BECAUSE THEY THEY SET

01:37:50.565 --> 01:37:53.201 region:rollup2
THE PRECEDENT AND REALLY.

01:37:51.099 --> 01:37:55.002 region:rollup2
.

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:56.404 region:rollup2
OTHER CLARIFY WHAT THE GOALS ARE

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:57.905 region:rollup2
FOR THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORK

01:37:56.404 --> 01:37:58.539 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S

01:37:57.905 --> 01:38:01.309 region:rollup2
WORKING.

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:02.377 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT.

01:38:01.309 --> 01:38:04.846 region:rollup2
I'M WHATEVER'S PUT IN PLACE AN

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:06.781 region:rollup2
INTERIM FASHION IS REVISITED.

01:38:04.846 --> 01:38:08.416 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:09.751 region:rollup2
ARE IN PLACE.

01:38:08.416 --> 01:38:12.186 region:rollup2
AND I DO WANNA JUST REMIND

01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:14.155 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT THE CURRENT RATE

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:14.689 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IS DYSFUNCTIONAL AND

01:38:14.155 --> 01:38:16.057 region:rollup2
IT'S HARMFUL TO CHILDREN.

01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:17.859 region:rollup2
IT'S

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:20.094 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT WORKING.

01:38:17.859 --> 01:38:20.661 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CHILDREN WHO NEED

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:22.330 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND AREN'T GETTING

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:23.531 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:38:22.330 --> 01:38:25.900 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CHILDREN BEING

01:38:23.531 --> 01:38:28.636 region:rollup2
COMMODIFIED IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:31.606 region:rollup2
TO GET A CERTAIN RATE.

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:34.041 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT FOCUSED ON QUALITY

01:38:31.606 --> 01:38:36.544 region:rollup2
OF CARE.

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:38.479 region:rollup2
SO AS WE LOOK FORWARD ON.

01:38:36.544 --> 01:38:40.414 region:rollup2
I REALLY HOPE THAT THE FOCUS

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:42.283 region:rollup2
STAYS ON QUALITY OF CARE AND

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:43.785 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T PATHOLOGY EYES

01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:44.886 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN THE PROCESS OF

01:38:43.785 --> 01:38:47.522 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THE RATE STRUCTURE.

01:38:44.886 --> 01:38:49.223 region:rollup2
.

01:38:47.522 --> 01:38:51.058 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:52.827 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS DISRUPTIVE.

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:55.029 region:rollup2
TWO USER.

01:38:52.827 --> 01:38:57.331 region:rollup2
A CURRENT TERM OF IT IS BIG

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:59.434 region:rollup2

01:51:14.835 --> 01:51:19.439 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:51:17.271 --> 01:51:22.042 region:rollup2
THE.

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:23.544 region:rollup2
I I KEEP RUNNING TALLY GOING OUT

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:25.379 region:rollup2
WE GOT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:51:23.544 --> 01:51:26.780 region:rollup2
FIVE DAYS BEFORE. FOR A DECEMBER

01:51:25.379 --> 01:51:28.115 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIRST

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:29.516 region:rollup2
SO IT'S SORT OF YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:51:28.115 --> 01:51:31.652 region:rollup2
GETTING UP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE.

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:32.886 region:rollup2
WHOSE FIRST SEMESTER MAYBE

01:51:31.652 --> 01:51:33.887 region:rollup2
HALFWAY INTO THE SECOND

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:35.088 region:rollup2
AND WHERE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:36.423 region:rollup2
THOSE

01:51:35.088 --> 01:51:38.926 region:rollup2
PUPILS WERE HAVING A TOUGHER

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:40.127 region:rollup2
TIME AND GIVE THE MORE ATTENTION

01:51:38.926 --> 01:51:43.430 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T GIVE UP ON ANYBODY.

01:51:40.127 --> 01:51:44.898 region:rollup2
ARM BUT WE SORT OF START PULLING

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:46.800 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ACROSS BOTH WE ALSO DON'T

01:51:44.898 --> 01:51:49.469 region:rollup2
LOWER THE STANDARDS

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:51.905 region:rollup2
ON THE STANDARDS HAVE TO STUDY.

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:52.739 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS WE WOULD SET UP WE'VE

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:54.308 region:rollup2
WE'VE SORT

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:55.275 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY DREAMED ABOUT? ON

01:51:54.308 --> 01:51:56.610 region:rollup2
THE THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:58.879 region:rollup2
PROCESSES.

01:51:56.610 --> 01:52:00.080 region:rollup2
ALEJO'S NOTED.

01:51:58.879 --> 01:52:00.514 region:rollup2
HOME DEFINITELY SORT OF BECAME A

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.114 region:rollup2
BIT OF A CHOKE POINT

01:52:00.514 --> 01:52:03.517 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:05.052 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:52:03.517 --> 01:52:06.186 region:rollup2
AND AND IT WAS IRONIC IN IT'S

01:52:05.052 --> 01:52:07.387 region:rollup2
OWN WAY BECAUSE IF YOU THINK

01:52:06.186 --> 01:52:09.489 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT THAT WAS THE PEACE THAT

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:11.291 region:rollup2
WE HAD DONE A ONE YEAR PILOT ON.

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:12.259 region:rollup2
AND WORTH.

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:14.061 region:rollup2
ALL SET TO GO IT WAS GOOD

01:52:12.259 --> 01:52:15.162 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WAS GUT AND THEN IT

01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:17.764 region:rollup2
TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS JUST

01:52:15.162 --> 01:52:18.899 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT IN THE TRANSITION. TO

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:21.101 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT HADN'T YET

01:52:18.899 --> 01:52:22.469 region:rollup2
ENTERED INTO IT AND PREPARE.

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:23.937 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE STUMPED YOU KNOW WE

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:25.706 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED THE PROCESS IS

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:26.873 region:rollup2
GOTTEN OUT HOME.

01:52:25.706 --> 01:52:28.742 region:rollup2
MOVING I THINK QUITE A LOT

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:30.310 region:rollup2
FASTER COUNTIES REPORTING THAT

01:52:28.742 --> 01:52:32.646 region:rollup2
IT IS GOING A LOT FASTER BUT IN

01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:34.248 region:rollup2
ADDITION THANK YOU AB ONE TEN

01:52:32.646 --> 01:52:38.118 region:rollup2
HAS DEFINITELY SORT OF AVERTED

01:52:34.248 --> 01:52:39.486 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS A. LOOMING CRISIS

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:40.654 region:rollup2
AUTUMN AND IS AS FINANCES

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:42.990 region:rollup2
INDICATED WE'RE WORKING WITH

01:52:40.654 --> 01:52:44.424 region:rollup2
THEM FOR WHAT WILL BE THE GO

01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:45.892 region:rollup2
PAST JUNE THIRTIETH.

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:47.928 region:rollup2
OWN SOLUTION FOR PAYMENT OF

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:50.597 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT. WON'T BE THE OTHER

01:52:47.928 --> 01:52:51.832 region:rollup2
AREAS WHICH THERE'S BEEN SORT OF

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:53.667 region:rollup2
REFERENCE TO HIS IS THE LEVEL OF

01:52:51.832 --> 01:52:54.368 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:52:53.667 --> 01:52:56.069 region:rollup2
RATES AND THE THE THE

01:52:54.368 --> 01:52:58.538 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENTS

01:52:56.069 --> 01:53:01.008 region:rollup2
THE PARTICLES. ARE AYE AYE AYE

01:52:58.538 --> 01:53:02.743 region:rollup2
CIRCLE PLANS AND THEN MAYBE HAVE

01:53:01.008 --> 01:53:05.445 region:rollup2
SERVER OR GREGSON ELABORATE

01:53:02.743 --> 01:53:06.847 region:rollup2
ANYTHING AMISS. DE.

01:53:05.445 --> 01:53:08.248 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T A TOOL OUT THERE

01:53:06.847 --> 01:53:12.219 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN GO AND SHOP FOR AND

01:53:08.248 --> 01:53:16.289 region:rollup2
SAY LET'S DO A REAL NEEDS BASED.

01:53:12.219 --> 01:53:20.627 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENT FOR FOSTER USE

01:53:16.289 --> 01:53:21.561 region:rollup2
ARMED. MEN TO THE STATES THAT

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:22.629 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:24.698 region:rollup2
RATES ANYWHERE COMPARABLE TO

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:25.666 region:rollup2
OURS ALL DO WHAT WE ARE LEAVING

01:53:24.698 --> 01:53:27.267 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AN AGE BASED RIGHT TO

01:53:25.666 --> 01:53:29.102 region:rollup2
GET ONE RIGHT.

01:53:27.267 --> 01:53:29.970 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE THIS AGING ANOTHER

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:31.204 region:rollup2
RATE OF THAT IT IS NOT CONNECTED

01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:31.638 region:rollup2
TO. WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS NEEDS

01:53:31.204 --> 01:53:31.972 region:rollup2
ARE?

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.373 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE

01:53:31.972 --> 01:53:35.575 region:rollup2
TO HAVE.

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:37.678 region:rollup2
THEY IN A SENSE COMPENSATE FOR

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:39.746 region:rollup2
THE OUT OR MITIGATE THAT.

01:53:37.678 --> 01:53:40.681 region:rollup2
WELL HOME DEVELOPMENTS OF

01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:42.115 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENTS THE

01:53:40.681 --> 01:53:44.651 region:rollup2
STI SUPER FURTIVE. THAT VARY

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:45.786 region:rollup2
FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY ARM MOST

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:48.355 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE THEM BUT NOTABLE.

01:53:45.786 --> 01:53:50.924 region:rollup2
ARM AND THE ATTORNEYS ARE TO

01:53:48.355 --> 01:53:52.359 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPTION OF DO THEY PAY.

01:53:50.924 --> 01:53:53.860 region:rollup2
THEIR RATE WHEN THEY PLACE IN

01:53:52.359 --> 01:53:54.428 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COUNTY OR DO THEY PAY

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.195 region:rollup2
THE OTHER COUNTIES RIGHT ON

01:53:54.428 --> 01:53:57.464 region:rollup2
MINUTES.

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:58.498 region:rollup2
PRETTY COOL.

01:53:57.464 --> 01:53:59.700 region:rollup2
HERE'S THE POINTS I'D LIKE YOU

01:53:58.498 --> 01:54:00.967 region:rollup2
TO TOOK.

01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:02.269 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR ON ABOUT THE LEVEL OF

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:04.538 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:54:02.269 --> 01:54:06.273 region:rollup2
TIERED RATES.

01:54:04.538 --> 01:54:07.140 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST RATE THE LEVEL OF

01:54:06.273 --> 01:54:08.675 region:rollup2
CARE ONE RATE

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:10.744 region:rollup2
IS HIGHER.

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:12.646 region:rollup2
THEN THE RATES.

01:54:10.744 --> 01:54:16.483 region:rollup2
THAT EXISTED PREVIOUSLY.

01:54:12.646 --> 01:54:17.651 region:rollup2
SO NO ONE GETS A REDUCED RATE.

01:54:16.483 --> 01:54:20.420 region:rollup2
FROM THE FOSTER CARE PAYMENT

01:54:17.651 --> 01:54:22.589 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.324 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION BECOMES IS THERE A

01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:25.659 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGE THAT

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:27.094 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY MIGHT NOT GET A

01:54:25.659 --> 01:54:29.796 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENTS

01:54:27.094 --> 01:54:30.430 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE. LEVEL OF CARE

01:54:29.796 --> 01:54:32.165 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENT

01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:34.034 region:rollup2
ON

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:37.370 region:rollup2
SOLUTION WORKING WITH THE

01:54:34.034 --> 01:54:38.872 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO DO IS TO SAY. ARM.

01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:41.475 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE SPECIALIZED CARE AND

01:54:38.872 --> 01:54:44.644 region:rollup2
COMMIT RATE IS LOWER THAN THE

01:54:41.475 --> 01:54:45.946 region:rollup2
TEARS IN THE LEVEL OF CARE RATE.

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.747 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA ADVANTAGE

01:54:45.946 --> 01:54:48.281 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY BY USING THE LEVEL OF

01:54:46.747 --> 01:54:51.451 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:54:48.281 --> 01:54:53.720 region:rollup2
THAT. THEY WILL PROBABLY BENEFIT

01:54:51.451 --> 01:54:57.591 region:rollup2
IF YOUR ASCII RATES ARE HIGHER.

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:59.459 region:rollup2
THEN THE OPTION IS ALL STAY WITH

01:54:57.591 --> 01:55:00.827 region:rollup2
THE SCR UNTIL YOU'VE SUBMITTED

01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:02.129 region:rollup2
YOUR REPLIES PLAN WITH US IT

01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:04.464 region:rollup2
DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

01:55:02.129 --> 01:55:05.432 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE AND IT NEVER.

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:07.400 region:rollup2
REALISTICALLY WAS GOING TO BE

01:55:05.432 --> 01:55:09.503 region:rollup2
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DON'T DO.

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.805 region:rollup2
THINGS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:55:09.503 --> 01:55:12.372 region:rollup2
MOM AND WE YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL

01:55:11.805 --> 01:55:13.407 region:rollup2
THE FIFTY EIGHTH BECAUSE YOU

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:14.841 region:rollup2
NEVER START.

01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:22.282 region:rollup2
AUTUMN

01:55:14.841 --> 01:55:24.651 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS I THINK HA HA IT.

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:26.686 region:rollup2
FERNANDES IS QUESTION ABOUT ARM.

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:27.254 region:rollup2
WHO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE

01:55:26.686 --> 01:55:29.055 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF CARE RATE MCCANN'S

01:55:27.254 --> 01:55:30.957 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENT?

01:55:29.055 --> 01:55:32.859 region:rollup2
WE VERY DELIBERATELY DON'T WANT

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:33.727 region:rollup2
THEM CONFUSED.

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:35.428 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF CARE IS DETERMINING

01:55:33.727 --> 01:55:37.531 region:rollup2
A PAYMENT.

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:40.033 region:rollup2
TO THE CARE GIVER.

01:55:37.531 --> 01:55:42.202 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT ISN'T.

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:44.271 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE NEEDS THE

01:55:42.202 --> 01:55:46.540 region:rollup2
CARE GIVERS GOING TO HAVE IN

01:55:44.271 --> 01:55:47.574 region:rollup2
PROVIDING FOR THE START.

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:49.443 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT COMPENSATION TO THE

01:55:47.574 --> 01:55:52.779 region:rollup2
CAREGIVER.

01:55:49.443 --> 01:55:56.016 region:rollup2
IT'S MEETING THE.

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:57.284 region:rollup2
SUPERB KERINCI PROVISION COST.

01:55:56.016 --> 01:55:58.819 region:rollup2
THE KARENS INSTRUMENT IS

01:55:57.284 --> 01:56:02.055 region:rollup2
DETERMINED OF SERVICE NEEDS FOR

01:55:58.819 --> 01:56:03.857 region:rollup2
THE CHILD.

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:05.625 region:rollup2
OR WHAT WILL BE TRIGGERED

01:56:03.857 --> 01:56:06.860 region:rollup2
THROUGH EITHER MENTAL HEALTH

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:08.695 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OR. OTHER SYSTEMS

01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:10.497 region:rollup2
AND.

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:12.432 region:rollup2
ONE WOULD NEVER WANT TO CONFUSE

01:56:10.497 --> 01:56:15.101 region:rollup2
THE FUNCTIONING

01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:16.069 region:rollup2
SO THAT I COULD THINK.

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:19.072 region:rollup2
THIS WAS LOOSE WHAT LUCY WAS

01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:20.841 region:rollup2
ALLUDING TO THE COMMODIFICATION.

01:56:19.072 --> 01:56:22.943 region:rollup2
OF A CHILD'S ASSESSMENT

01:56:20.841 --> 01:56:26.046 region:rollup2
WE NEVER WANT TO PUT A DOLLAR

01:56:22.943 --> 01:56:28.415 region:rollup2
VALUE ON DETERMINING WHETHER

01:56:26.046 --> 01:56:29.883 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A CHILD HAS EMOTIONAL

01:56:28.415 --> 01:56:31.418 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE NEEDS OR OR WHATEVER

01:56:29.883 --> 01:56:32.586 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:56:31.418 --> 01:56:34.421 region:rollup2
NOT WOULD TOTALLY CONFUSE THE

01:56:32.586 --> 01:56:35.622 region:rollup2
FUNCTION AND BE

01:56:34.421 --> 01:56:38.625 region:rollup2
I THINK VERY UNFAIR TO THE

01:56:35.622 --> 01:56:39.192 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. ARM.

01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:40.060 region:rollup2
SORT OF MORE BROADLY TO THE

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:42.329 region:rollup2
MIDDLE.

01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:44.397 region:rollup2
REFLOATING ANXIETY ABOUT TIME IS

01:56:42.329 --> 01:56:46.366 region:rollup2
SHORT AND CHALLENGES A GREAT YES

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:47.968 region:rollup2
WE ARE FULLY AWARE OF IT AND

01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:50.136 region:rollup2
WALLEM.

01:56:47.968 --> 01:56:52.472 region:rollup2
THE FOR THE FIRST

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:54.374 region:rollup2
ELEMENT RIGHT NOW IS REALLY

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:58.278 region:rollup2
WORKING AT A GRANULAR FASHION

01:56:54.374 --> 01:56:59.746 region:rollup2
COUNTY BY COUNTY. PALM.

01:56:58.278 --> 01:57:01.815 region:rollup2
SERVICE ERRORS GROUP ARE DOING

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:03.984 region:rollup2
SORT OF REGULAR CALLS WITH ALL

01:57:01.815 --> 01:57:05.585 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY SAYING.

01:57:03.984 --> 01:57:06.086 region:rollup2
HOW MANY BEDS DO YOU NEED WHERE

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.988 region:rollup2
ARE YOU WHAT PROCESS IS

01:57:06.086 --> 01:57:09.289 region:rollup2
UNDERWAY?

01:57:07.988 --> 01:57:12.692 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY FOR THE ISSUE OF

01:57:09.289 --> 01:57:14.828 region:rollup2
RECRUITING OF THE NON SD RTP BUT

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:15.428 region:rollup2
STAY HOME BASED FAMILY BUT CARE.

01:57:14.828 --> 01:57:17.063 region:rollup2
BASED

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:19.165 region:rollup2

HOW TO ENGAGE KIDS RIGHT THE

02:00:52.345 --> 02:00:56.116 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE THE TIME?

WHEN WE WERE MAKING IT UP.

02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:04.691 region:rollup2
WHERE THE ACCURATE AND COULD WE

02:01:02.288 --> 02:01:07.694 region:rollup2
UNWITTINGLY DO SOMETHING WORSE?

02:01:04.691 --> 02:01:08.628 region:rollup2
ARM BECAUSE OF THE HOPE.

02:01:07.694 --> 02:01:10.930 region:rollup2

02:01:14.968 --> 02:01:18.738 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY VITAL AND IMPORTANT

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:19.439 region:rollup2
POINT AND I THINK IF WE DISMISS

THEN WE RUN THE RISK OF.

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:36.289 region:rollup2
DOING WORSE AND AND THAT'S JUST

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:39.759 region:rollup2

02:03:02.175 --> 02:03:05.144 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE TOOL AND WE

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:06.579 region:rollup2
HAVE STUDIED THE LEVEL OF CARE

02:03:05.144 --> 02:03:08.314 region:rollup2
TOOL AND WE DON'T THINK THERE IS

02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:10.149 region:rollup2
A SMALL RISK. THAT CHILDREN ARE

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:11.818 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ASSESSED PROPERLY

02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:13.386 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LEVEL OF CARE TOOL AND

02:03:11.818 --> 02:03:15.788 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LARGE RISK THAT THEY

02:03:13.386 --> 02:03:17.257 region:rollup2
WILL LOSE SPECIALIZED CARE AS A

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:18.524 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THIS NEW SYSTEM BEING

02:03:17.257 --> 02:03:20.093 region:rollup2

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:21.761 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN WE'RE

02:03:20.093 --> 02:03:23.863 region:rollup2
MAKING THE COUNTIES CHANGE THEIR

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:25.665 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED CARE PLANS WE DON'T

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:26.833 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THOSE SPECIALIZED CARE

02:03:25.665 --> 02:03:28.935 region:rollup2
PLANS ARE GOING TO BE AND THOSE

02:03:26.833 --> 02:03:30.970 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED

02:03:28.935 --> 02:03:32.972 region:rollup2

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:35.174 region:rollup2
NO SMALL UNDERTAKING AND OUR

02:03:32.972 --> 02:03:36.676 region:rollup2

CHALLENGING NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE

ANYTHING THAT SLOWS THAT DOWN IS

02:22:02.881 --> 02:22:07.252 region:rollup2

02:26:30.882 --> 02:26:34.686 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WHAT'S DOING RIGHT FOR

02:26:33.051 --> 02:26:37.422 region:rollup2
THESE FAMILIES DON'T ASK THEM TO

02:26:34.686 --> 02:26:39.257 region:rollup2
SUFFER. WHILE YOU FLY THE PLANE

02:26:37.422 --> 02:26:40.392 region:rollup2
AND FIX IT AT THE SAME TIME

02:26:39.257 --> 02:26:42.827 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

02:26:40.392 --> 02:26:46.164 region:rollup2
SUFFER. AND THAT JUST SHOULDN'T

02:26:42.827 --> 02:26:49.467 region:rollup2
HAPPEN SOME ASKING FOR A DELAY

02:26:46.164 --> 02:26:52.937 region:rollup2
UNMASKING FOR TRUE VALIDATION OF

02:26:49.467 --> 02:26:54.773 region:rollup2
THE TOOL BEFORE IT MOVES FORWARD

02:26:52.937 --> 02:26:55.640 region:rollup2
BIG. THANK YOU MA'AM.

02:26:54.773 --> 02:26:57.909 region:rollup2
A LUCY STILL SEE THE CARTER YOU

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:59.277 region:rollup2
PLUS CENTER I'M JUST A COUPLE OF

02:26:57.909 --> 02:26:59.844 region:rollup2
THINGS I WANTED TO ADD.

02:26:59.277 --> 02:27:00.412 region:rollup2
THAT ONE IS WE'RE REALLY.

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:00.912 region:rollup2
IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE

02:27:00.412 --> 02:27:02.047 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FOR.

02:27:00.912 --> 02:27:03.748 region:rollup2
RESOURCE PARENTS TO MAKE SURE

02:27:02.047 --> 02:27:06.951 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED.

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:08.520 region:rollup2
AND IN THE LEVEL OF CARE

02:27:06.951 --> 02:27:09.788 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:11.723 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:27:09.788 --> 02:27:13.325 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS REALLY DOES STAY ON

02:27:11.723 --> 02:27:15.927 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN.

02:27:13.325 --> 02:27:18.496 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IN

02:27:15.927 --> 02:27:19.964 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT SYSTEM REFORM.

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:21.232 region:rollup2
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN

02:27:19.964 --> 02:27:24.436 region:rollup2
ITERATIVE PROCESS.

02:27:21.232 --> 02:27:26.438 region:rollup2
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE. A BIG

02:27:24.436 --> 02:27:28.139 region:rollup2
STEP FORWARD AND.

02:27:26.438 --> 02:27:30.141 region:rollup2
SOME MID COURSE CORRECTIONS SO I

02:27:28.139 --> 02:27:32.143 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S.

02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:33.778 region:rollup2
REALISTIC TO EXPECT AND AND WE

02:27:32.143 --> 02:27:35.480 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE AT

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:36.548 region:rollup2
THE EXPENSE OF THE CHILDREN ARE

02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:38.216 region:rollup2
THE FAMILIES.

02:27:36.548 --> 02:27:40.285 region:rollup2
EVER.

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:41.286 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:27:40.285 --> 02:27:42.620 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T ENTERED OF PROCESS.

02:27:41.286 --> 02:27:45.523 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:47.192 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:27:45.523 --> 02:27:48.460 region:rollup2
SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT

02:27:47.192 --> 02:27:49.961 region:rollup2
ON THE ISSUE TO I'M GOING TO

02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:51.763 region:rollup2
BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS

02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:53.264 region:rollup2
TWENTY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE.

02:27:51.763 --> 02:27:54.899 region:rollup2
AND I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:57.335 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW.

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:58.436 region:rollup2
.

02:27:57.335 --> 02:28:00.105 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS BUT I

02:27:58.436 --> 02:28:02.040 region:rollup2
THINK THE FIRST THING THAT I

02:28:00.105 --> 02:28:02.607 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT. I'VE

02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:03.775 region:rollup2
SAID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN

02:28:02.607 --> 02:28:05.343 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:28:03.775 --> 02:28:06.111 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SIT UP

02:28:05.343 --> 02:28:08.313 region:rollup2
HERE AND TALK ABOUT.

02:28:06.111 --> 02:28:10.749 region:rollup2
A.

02:28:08.313 --> 02:28:12.717 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

02:28:10.749 --> 02:28:14.285 region:rollup2
LIKE FOR THEIR BUDGET LINE

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:16.121 region:rollup2
ITEMS AND I THINK THAT'S GOING

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:17.989 region:rollup2
TO THE THE MOST FRUSTRATING

02:28:16.121 --> 02:28:19.557 region:rollup2
THING FOR ME. THE LAST YEAR AND

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:21.593 region:rollup2
A HALF IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT.

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:24.195 region:rollup2
.

02:28:21.593 --> 02:28:25.263 region:rollup2
KIDS AND ADULTS WITH NEEDS AS IF

02:28:24.195 --> 02:28:27.832 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LINE ITEMS AND I CAN

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:30.368 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE. THE.

02:28:27.832 --> 02:28:32.504 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMING.

02:28:30.368 --> 02:28:34.105 region:rollup2
JOB THAT THE DEPARTMENT HOUSE

02:28:32.504 --> 02:28:35.440 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO.

02:28:34.105 --> 02:28:37.008 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT A WILL WE'RE NOT

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:38.810 region:rollup2
GOING TO FUND IT THIS YEAR WE'RE

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:41.579 region:rollup2
GONNA FIND IT NEXT YEAR AS IF.

02:28:38.810 --> 02:28:43.248 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE. WAITING.

02:28:41.579 --> 02:28:44.849 region:rollup2
A.

02:28:43.248 --> 02:28:47.152 region:rollup2
AROUND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ON

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:48.853 region:rollup2
HOLD AND THERE'LL BE NO ISSUES

02:28:47.152 --> 02:28:50.021 region:rollup2
IN THE MEANTIME AND I'M. I'M NOT

02:28:48.853 --> 02:28:51.589 region:rollup2

TREMENDOUS

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:02.667 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SO MUCH ON

BUT.

02:30:14.372 --> 02:30:18.243 region:rollup2

OF THE DAY THEM LONGER WE TAKE.

02:30:42.967 --> 02:30:46.971 region:rollup2
TWO TO TO FIGURE THIS OUT

02:30:45.370 --> 02:30:49.507 region:rollup2
THERE'S KIDS THAT ARE BEING

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:50.842 region:rollup2

02:30:50.842 --> 02:30:55.947 region:rollup2
AND LA COUNTY WITHOUT PLACEMENT.

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:57.081 region:rollup2
I THE HOW IS IT THAT.

02:30:55.947 --> 02:30:59.617 region:rollup2
WE.

02:30:57.081 --> 02:31:01.719 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:02.887 region:rollup2
MONEY AVAILABLE AND IT'S TAKING

02:31:01.719 --> 02:31:04.556 region:rollup2
SO LONG FOR SOME OF THESE

02:31:02.887 --> 02:31:06.224 region:rollup2
PARENTS AYE ULCER I WAS TOO LONG

02:31:04.556 --> 02:31:07.959 region:rollup2
TOO MANY THINGS TO TAKE NOTES ON

02:31:06.224 --> 02:31:09.460 region:rollup2
I WAS TRYING TO KEEP UP BUT. THE

02:31:07.959 --> 02:31:11.362 region:rollup2
OTHER THING THAT I HEARD WAS.

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:13.865 region:rollup2
.

02:31:11.362 --> 02:31:15.133 region:rollup2
THE.

02:31:13.865 --> 02:31:17.101 region:rollup2
THE KIDS ARE BEING REMOVED

02:31:15.133 --> 02:31:19.737 region:rollup2
FROM HOMES.

02:31:17.101 --> 02:31:20.738 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF WHATEVER ISSUES AND

02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:22.507 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:24.042 region:rollup2
MADE WAS WE ARE SCOURING THE

02:31:22.507 --> 02:31:25.276 region:rollup2
KIDS.

02:31:24.042 --> 02:31:26.945 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILIES

02:31:25.276 --> 02:31:29.314 region:rollup2
THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE THESE

02:31:26.945 --> 02:31:31.082 region:rollup2
KIDS IN BUT YET ARE REMOVED

02:31:29.314 --> 02:31:32.483 region:rollup2
THERE I'M SURE THEY HAVE TO BE

02:31:31.082 --> 02:31:33.885 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGED AND WON'T TAKE

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:35.586 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHILD AND.

02:31:33.885 --> 02:31:37.121 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOW IN THIS PROCESS

02:31:35.586 --> 02:31:38.389 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WORK SO NOT ONLY ARE WE

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:39.490 region:rollup2
HARMING THE CHILDREN BUT WE'RE

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:41.059 region:rollup2
LOSING FAMILIES THAT CAN BE

02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:43.194 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

02:31:41.059 --> 02:31:44.996 region:rollup2
A CAREGIVERS FOR THESE KIDS AND

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:46.397 region:rollup2
I'M NOT TALKING. DARK DON'T LIKE

ANYBODY.

02:31:49.834 --> 02:31:53.671 region:rollup2
BUT AT SOME POINT.

02:31:51.636 --> 02:31:55.640 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO

02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:57.642 region:rollup2
DO TO ASSIST YOUR DEPARTMENT AND

02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:59.344 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE. TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:31:57.642 --> 02:32:00.578 region:rollup2
ISSUES IT'S HEART BREAKING.

02:31:59.344 --> 02:32:01.546 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I CAN APPRECIATE THE

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:02.447 region:rollup2
STRESS YOU'RE UNDER BECAUSE I

02:32:01.546 --> 02:32:03.548 region:rollup2
TRY.

02:32:02.447 --> 02:32:07.085 region:rollup2
TO.

02:32:03.548 --> 02:32:09.420 region:rollup2

TO THE NEXT ISSUE TOMORROW

02:32:10.888 --> 02:32:14.392 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF I SIT.

02:32:12.724 --> 02:32:16.060 region:rollup2
AND AND THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE

02:32:14.392 --> 02:32:17.795 region:rollup2
TIME I WOULD BE A MESS

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:20.431 region:rollup2
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND I CAN'T

IT'S TAKING SIX MONTHS FOR THEM

02:33:27.231 --> 02:33:31.002 region:rollup2
TO GET ANY KIND OF FUN.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH

02:33:31.002 --> 02:33:33.771 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES THAT THEY'RE

MANY NOT MANY SOME ISSUES.

02:33:49.821 --> 02:33:53.458 region:rollup2
OUR FOR PRE DATING.

02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:55.526 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS CARE REFORM SO FOR

02:33:53.458 --> 02:33:57.295 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:59.030 region:rollup2
SOME COUNTIES ALWAYS MADE A

02:33:57.295 --> 02:34:01.032 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN THE PAST WHEN A

02:33:59.030 --> 02:34:02.333 region:rollup2
CHILD WAS PLACED THEY WOULD MAKE

02:34:01.032 --> 02:34:03.835 region:rollup2
A THE MEDIA PAYMENT THROUGH

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:05.136 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE OR CAL

02:34:03.835 --> 02:34:06.237 region:rollup2
WORKS OR WHATEVER.

02:34:05.136 --> 02:34:08.072 region:rollup2
SOME COUNTIES DIDN'T MAKE

02:34:06.237 --> 02:34:10.007 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:11.309 region:rollup2
PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY THEY WAITED

02:34:10.007 --> 02:34:12.243 region:rollup2
UNTIL THEY'VE APPROVED.

02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:13.978 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE APPROVAL

02:34:12.243 --> 02:34:15.646 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:18.015 region:rollup2
WHICH NOW THAT THAT WOULD DIDN'T

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:20.184 region:rollup2
CREATE THE CRISIS HOWEVER THEN

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:22.286 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T TAKE OF LAW.

02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:23.488 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WENT TO THE RFA PROCESS

02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:25.256 region:rollup2
WHICH EVERYBODY DID BECAUSE IT

02:34:23.488 --> 02:34:27.325 region:rollup2
WAS A GOOD THING TO DO BECAUSE

02:34:25.256 --> 02:34:29.560 region:rollup2
THAT WAY YOU ARE ESTABLISHING AT

02:34:27.325 --> 02:34:32.230 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING. THAT POTENTIALLY

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:33.498 region:rollup2
THIS IS A HOME THAT WILL BE

02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:33.965 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE PERMANENTLY FOR

02:34:33.498 --> 02:34:35.700 region:rollup2
STABILITY.

02:34:33.965 --> 02:34:37.635 region:rollup2
IF

02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:40.271 region:rollup2
REUNIFICATION DOESN'T WORK.

02:34:37.635 --> 02:34:41.439 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT ADDED TIME TO THE

02:34:40.271 --> 02:34:42.607 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND SO THAT'S REALLY

02:34:41.439 --> 02:34:44.542 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE FIX.

02:34:42.607 --> 02:34:46.344 region:rollup2
YOU DID. ARM.

02:34:44.542 --> 02:34:47.879 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO SORT

02:34:46.344 --> 02:34:49.647 region:rollup2
OF MOVE THROUGH A I MEAN IT JUST

02:34:47.879 --> 02:34:50.281 region:rollup2
WENT INTO EFFECT. IN MARCH

02:34:49.647 --> 02:34:53.518 region:rollup2
SO IT MADE WERE IN APRIL.

02:34:50.281 --> 02:34:54.852 region:rollup2
SO.

02:34:53.518 --> 02:34:57.155 region:rollup2
WOULD WANTED AFFECT ABLE FIRST

02:34:54.852 --> 02:34:58.790 region:rollup2
WORD PEOPLE ELEVEN SO THERE

02:34:57.155 --> 02:34:59.857 region:rollup2
THERE PROBABLY IS A LITTLE BIT

02:34:58.790 --> 02:35:01.692 region:rollup2
OF THROUGHPUT TIME HERE.

02:34:59.857 --> 02:35:03.261 region:rollup2
ARM BUT.

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:04.662 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE SORT OF THE SHORT

02:35:03.261 --> 02:35:05.429 region:rollup2
TERM SOLUTION THAT AS I SAID

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:07.031 region:rollup2
WILL COME TO YOU IN THE MAY

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:08.599 region:rollup2
REVISION RIGHT WITH A LONG TERM

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:10.034 region:rollup2
THANK YOU BUT.

02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:11.135 region:rollup2
AND AND I SAID THIS IN MY SAY

02:35:10.034 --> 02:35:12.904 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:35:11.135 --> 02:35:14.305 region:rollup2
I AM A LOT OF COMMITTEES THAT I

02:35:12.904 --> 02:35:15.840 region:rollup2
SIT ON AND I'M SAYING I SAID IT

02:35:14.305 --> 02:35:17.141 region:rollup2
ON MONDAY.

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.409 region:rollup2
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:20.411 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED THE

02:35:18.409 --> 02:35:22.346 region:rollup2
PROCESSES YET WE'RE THE ONES

02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:23.714 region:rollup2
THAT CREATE THE PROCESS.

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:25.349 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN IF WE CREATE A PROP

02:35:23.714 --> 02:35:28.920 region:rollup2
THEN WHY DO WE MAKE IT SO

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:31.923 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED. AYE THAT'S MY RIGHT

02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:33.658 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT WE GO AGAIN BACK.

02:35:31.923 --> 02:35:35.159 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHO WE FELT FEET A SET

02:35:33.658 --> 02:35:35.726 region:rollup2
I THINK BURKE IF SHE WAS WHAT

02:35:35.159 --> 02:35:36.794 region:rollup2
WAS HAVE THE WORDS OF IT'S

02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:38.829 region:rollup2
REALLY CRITICAL IS A CULTURE

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:40.731 region:rollup2
CHANGE HERE. AND BOTH TAKE A

02:35:38.829 --> 02:35:41.566 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT AYE AYE EDITOR LIKE

02:35:40.731 --> 02:35:43.367 region:rollup2
THEM AND ACTOR LA AND LIKE ONE

02:35:41.566 --> 02:35:43.935 region:rollup2
BUT BUT FOR ME AND AND I. AM NOT

02:35:43.367 --> 02:35:46.904 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO MY TEACHING

02:35:43.935 --> 02:35:47.838 region:rollup2
ANALOGY IS THAT IF I CREATE A

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:48.506 region:rollup2
TEST.

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:50.007 region:rollup2
AND THEN COMPLAIN THAT THE KISS

02:35:48.506 --> 02:35:50.608 region:rollup2
FAILED THE TEST BECAUSE IT WAS

02:35:50.007 --> 02:35:51.108 region:rollup2
TOO HARD WHILE I CREATE AT THE

02:35:50.608 --> 02:35:53.511 region:rollup2
TEST.

02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:55.146 region:rollup2
AND SO SO. YOU KNOW AND I THINK

02:35:53.511 --> 02:35:56.614 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE THE EVENT IS NOT JUST

02:35:55.146 --> 02:35:58.382 region:rollup2
FROM YOU I HEAR IT FROM THIS

02:35:56.614 --> 02:35:59.717 region:rollup2
WHOLE PLACE IS THAT. THIS IS A

02:35:58.382 --> 02:36:01.352 region:rollup2
COMPLETE IT'S A COMPLICATED THIS

02:35:59.717 --> 02:36:02.954 region:rollup2
IS COMPLICATE WILL OF COURSE WE

02:36:01.352 --> 02:36:06.390 region:rollup2
ARE CREATING IT AND IF IT'S AT

02:36:02.954 --> 02:36:07.959 region:rollup2
SOME POINT HOW DO I.

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:10.461 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE OR HOW DO YOU

02:36:07.959 --> 02:36:13.764 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE YOUR DEPARTMENTS OR

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:15.132 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES TO PUT A HARD INTO

02:36:13.764 --> 02:36:17.034 region:rollup2
WITH THESE PRODUCTS A FEW

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:18.703 region:rollup2
THERE'S A THERE'S A BIG HEART.

02:36:17.034 --> 02:36:19.170 region:rollup2
IT EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT THEM THEN

02:36:18.703 --> 02:36:21.305 region:rollup2
WHERE IS THE URGENCY.

02:36:19.170 --> 02:36:23.040 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE ANY URGENCY BECAUSE

02:36:21.305 --> 02:36:24.976 region:rollup2
LET ME TELL YOU WHEN MY DAUGHTER

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:27.945 region:rollup2
WAS SICK I WAS ON THE PHONE AND

02:36:24.976 --> 02:36:29.747 region:rollup2
AND IT'S. IT'S A REALLY SMALL.

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:31.582 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A A EXAMPLE BUT I WAS

02:36:29.747 --> 02:36:32.683 region:rollup2
ON THE PHONE CALLING MAKING SURE

02:36:31.582 --> 02:36:34.151 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEBODY COULD TAKE HER TO

02:36:32.683 --> 02:36:35.786 region:rollup2
THE DOCTOR THAT SOMEBODY CAN YOU

02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:37.688 region:rollup2
KNOW ALL THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT

02:36:35.786 --> 02:36:38.823 region:rollup2
WAS. PERSONAL BECAUSE I WAS LIKE

BE WITH MY DAUGHTER.

02:36:42.093 --> 02:36:45.596 region:rollup2
SO THE BET NEXT BEST THING WAS

02:36:43.728 --> 02:36:47.265 region:rollup2
TO CALL SOMEBODY TO HELP ME AT

02:36:45.596 --> 02:36:48.833 region:rollup2
SOME POINT WHERE IS THAT URGENCY

SOMETHING THAT WEAK CREED THAT

02:37:20.331 --> 02:37:24.101 region:rollup2
REPUTATION WAS CREATED BECAUSE

02:37:22.667 --> 02:37:27.204 region:rollup2

WHOM?

02:39:05.102 --> 02:39:07.671 region:rollup2
IT WAS DEVELOPED IN A

02:39:05.569 --> 02:39:10.541 region:rollup2
CONSULTATIVE PROCESS WITH COUNTY

02:39:07.671 --> 02:39:12.910 region:rollup2
FARM CHILD WELFARE FOLKS AND OUR

02:39:10.541 --> 02:39:14.211 region:rollup2

IN ON THE PROCESS I DON'T WANT

02:39:14.211 --> 02:39:17.381 region:rollup2
TO CLAIM THAT THEY BLESSED TO

02:39:16.514 --> 02:39:18.215 region:rollup2
KNOW NONE BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT

02:39:17.381 --> 02:39:19.316 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THAT'S MY QUESTION

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:20.484 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS

02:39:19.316 --> 02:39:21.952 region:rollup2
SIMPLE. ACTS

02:39:20.484 --> 02:39:22.753 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE WERE

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:24.021 region:rollup2
THERE WERE WRITTEN

02:39:22.753 --> 02:39:26.857 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS MADE THAT WERE

02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:29.226 region:rollup2
NOT FOLLOWED.

02:39:26.857 --> 02:39:32.163 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE BILL SOMETIMES

02:39:29.226 --> 02:39:33.397 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AYE THE BILL NO NO NO NO

02:39:32.163 --> 02:39:34.098 region:rollup2
NO RIGHT TO IT WHICH I'M NOT

02:39:33.397 --> 02:39:38.302 region:rollup2
GONNA VERSION OF A BILL SOMETIME

02:39:34.098 --> 02:39:38.736 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WE'RE EXPECTED TO

02:39:38.302 --> 02:39:39.403 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THIS NO.

02:39:38.736 --> 02:39:40.070 region:rollup2
AND THOUGH SOMETIMES HAPPEN IS

02:39:39.403 --> 02:39:40.771 region:rollup2
NOT A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER BECAUSE

02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:42.373 region:rollup2
IT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO DETERMINE

02:39:40.771 --> 02:39:43.607 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF CARE FOR CHILDREN.

02:39:42.373 --> 02:39:44.408 region:rollup2
BOWLS DOT SOMETIMES HAPPEN IS

02:39:43.607 --> 02:39:47.178 region:rollup2
NOT A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER THE

02:39:44.408 --> 02:39:49.280 region:rollup2
THAT THE COUNTY TEAM THAT WORKED

02:39:47.178 --> 02:39:50.047 region:rollup2
ON DEVELOPING IT BASED ON WHAT

02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:53.050 region:rollup2
THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE MOST

02:39:50.047 --> 02:39:55.219 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL SPECIALIZED CARE.

02:39:53.050 --> 02:39:56.720 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL TOOLS.

02:39:55.219 --> 02:39:59.323 region:rollup2
IN USE IN THE STATE THAT'S

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:01.625 region:rollup2
PROBABLY AS GOOD A STANDARD AS

02:39:59.323 --> 02:40:03.828 region:rollup2
ONE CAN GET IN ADVANCE NO I

02:40:01.625 --> 02:40:07.765 region:rollup2
FULLY GET THIS NOTION OF. WELL

02:40:03.828 --> 02:40:09.400 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU TEST IT WELL HOW DO

02:40:07.765 --> 02:40:10.734 region:rollup2
YOU TEST IT HOME WELL. I USE THE

02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:12.136 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF RESOURCE FAMILY

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:14.538 region:rollup2
APPROVAL WILL BE THAT OF YOUR

02:40:12.136 --> 02:40:15.539 region:rollup2
LONG PILOT FOR COUNTIES AND IT

02:40:14.538 --> 02:40:17.341 region:rollup2
SEEMED TO BE GOING GREAT AND

02:40:15.539 --> 02:40:18.342 region:rollup2
THEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT PLACE.

02:40:17.341 --> 02:40:19.677 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A HICCUP

02:40:18.342 --> 02:40:22.079 region:rollup2
SO. AT SOME POINT HERE'S WHAT WE

02:40:19.677 --> 02:40:24.415 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO.

02:40:22.079 --> 02:40:28.119 region:rollup2
START

02:40:24.415 --> 02:40:29.653 region:rollup2

SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENT LOSES

02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:35.926 region:rollup2
THEIR SPECIALIZED CARE

02:40:33.757 --> 02:40:37.261 region:rollup2
INCREMENT.

FUTURE AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS

02:41:41.192 --> 02:41:42.826 region:rollup2

THEY CAN ONLY GET.

02:42:20.397 --> 02:42:22.132 region:rollup2
A HIGHER AMOUNT.

02:42:21.498 --> 02:42:24.235 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:42:22.132 --> 02:42:25.869 region:rollup2
IF.

02:42:24.235 --> 02:42:27.805 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE IS

02:42:25.869 --> 02:42:29.006 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE COMING IN THAT SAYS

02:42:27.805 --> 02:42:31.875 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ON.

02:42:29.006 --> 02:42:34.345 region:rollup2
IT INCREMENTAL INCREASE A BOLD

02:42:31.875 --> 02:42:35.212 region:rollup2
THAT AND FOR SOME REASON DIDN'T

02:42:34.345 --> 02:42:36.447 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S WHAT WE ARE JUST

02:42:35.212 --> 02:42:38.182 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD BUT IF WE STOP AND

02:42:36.447 --> 02:42:39.950 region:rollup2
SAY NOPE WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS

02:42:38.182 --> 02:42:42.386 region:rollup2
THING.

02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:43.153 region:rollup2

02:42:45.756 --> 02:42:48.258 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH.

02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:50.561 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:42:48.258 --> 02:42:52.429 region:rollup2

MEETINGS ARE HOSTILE TO BE

02:42:57.134 --> 02:43:02.072 region:rollup2
HONEST I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW AND

AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE

02:46:40.357 --> 02:46:43.927 region:rollup2
THE DEADLINE OF TWELVE THIRTY

02:46:41.625 --> 02:46:46.897 region:rollup2
ONE FOR ME TO BE HONEST I THINK

02:46:43.927 --> 02:46:48.398 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD. A DELAY IT UNTIL WE

02:46:52.002 --> 02:46:56.006 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE NOT EVEN AT THAT LEVEL.

02:46:53.737 --> 02:46:57.641 region:rollup2
IT WERE GOING TO DRAMATIZE AND

02:46:56.006 --> 02:46:58.275 region:rollup2
RE TRAUMATIZE MORE CHILDREN AND

02:46:57.641 --> 02:47:01.545 region:rollup2

02:49:38.301 --> 02:49:40.637 region:rollup2
FIND WE CANNOT PICK SOME PLACES

02:49:39.603 --> 02:49:41.204 region:rollup2
TO START.

02:49:40.637 --> 02:49:43.306 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IT MEANS

02:49:41.204 --> 02:49:45.409 region:rollup2
ARMED.

02:49:43.306 --> 02:49:46.843 region:rollup2
THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WATER IS A

02:49:45.409 --> 02:49:48.311 region:rollup2
GRADUAL START WEBER WHAT WE'RE

02:49:46.843 --> 02:49:51.081 region:rollup2
STARTING WITH.

02:49:48.311 --> 02:49:53.283 region:rollup2
OR THE. OR THE CHILDREN COMING

02:49:51.081 --> 02:49:55.585 region:rollup2
INTO CARE NEW.

02:49:53.283 --> 02:49:56.820 region:rollup2
AFTER A CERTAIN DATE NO WE'VE

02:49:55.585 --> 02:49:58.655 region:rollup2
ALREADY MADE THE PROFICIENT OUT

02:49:56.820 --> 02:50:00.357 region:rollup2
OF A COUNTY SAYS IT'S NOT READY

02:49:58.655 --> 02:50:01.892 region:rollup2
TO START.

02:50:00.357 --> 02:50:02.893 region:rollup2
THEY CAN NOTIFY US

02:50:01.892 --> 02:50:04.428 region:rollup2
AND THEY WILL GIVE THEM A

02:50:02.893 --> 02:50:05.062 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DATE.

02:50:04.428 --> 02:50:05.796 region:rollup2
IF THEY HAVEN'T TRAINED UP THERE

02:50:05.062 --> 02:50:07.564 region:rollup2
STOP

02:50:05.796 --> 02:50:09.166 region:rollup2
THE CRANE UP.

02:50:07.564 --> 02:50:11.134 region:rollup2
AND THE READY TO START THEN THEY

02:50:09.166 --> 02:50:13.737 region:rollup2
WILL START NOT WITH HUNDREDS OR

02:50:11.134 --> 02:50:15.072 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF THESE POLICIES WE

02:50:13.737 --> 02:50:17.074 region:rollup2
ARE TALKING TENDS.

02:50:15.072 --> 02:50:18.809 region:rollup2
A DAY SORT OF THING.

02:50:17.074 --> 02:50:21.011 region:rollup2
I WAS THOSE.

02:50:18.809 --> 02:50:22.846 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT EVALUATION CONTINUES

02:50:21.011 --> 02:50:24.781 region:rollup2
FROM OUR OUR RESEARCH CONTRACT

02:50:22.846 --> 02:50:25.949 region:rollup2
WE WILL GET.

02:50:24.781 --> 02:50:27.517 region:rollup2
WE WON'T NECESSARILY GET

02:50:25.949 --> 02:50:30.187 region:rollup2
VALIDITY.

02:50:27.517 --> 02:50:30.854 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WILL GET IS RELIABILITY

02:50:30.187 --> 02:50:31.755 region:rollup2
ARE WE GETTING INTER RATER

02:50:30.854 --> 02:50:34.291 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY

02:50:31.755 --> 02:50:35.192 region:rollup2
THAT'S TESTIMONY?

02:50:34.291 --> 02:50:37.094 region:rollup2
AREN'T I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT

02:50:35.192 --> 02:50:37.661 region:rollup2
VERY PRELIMINARY DATA THAT WE'VE

02:50:37.094 --> 02:50:38.228 region:rollup2
GOTTEN ALREADY BECAUSE IT'S

02:50:37.661 --> 02:50:39.996 region:rollup2
SMALL BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO

02:50:38.228 --> 02:50:42.866 region:rollup2
FAR.

02:50:39.996 --> 02:50:44.568 region:rollup2
IN THE FFA TEST IS CONSISTENT

02:50:42.866 --> 02:50:46.770 region:rollup2
INTER RATER RELIABILITY I'M NOT

02:50:44.568 --> 02:50:47.571 region:rollup2
WORRIED ABOUT THE RELIABILITY

02:50:46.770 --> 02:50:51.708 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT I CAN SEE YET.

02:50:47.571 --> 02:50:52.642 region:rollup2
NOT LIKE.

02:50:51.708 --> 02:50:54.644 region:rollup2
TOTALLY GET LEAVE MY SELF WHEN

02:50:52.642 --> 02:50:55.312 region:rollup2
TO COME BACK IN A WEEK OR TWO

02:50:54.644 --> 02:50:56.413 region:rollup2
THAT WILL.

02:50:55.312 --> 02:50:57.013 region:rollup2
SORRY IF IT'S GOING THE

02:50:56.413 --> 02:50:59.182 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WE'RE GONNA DO SOME

02:50:57.013 --> 02:51:00.917 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:50:59.182 --> 02:51:02.786 region:rollup2
BUT AS LONG SECURING RELIABILITY

02:51:00.917 --> 02:51:05.355 region:rollup2
THEN THE QUESTION ABILITY STARTS

02:51:02.786 --> 02:51:09.459 region:rollup2
TO BE AS THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE

02:51:05.355 --> 02:51:09.893 region:rollup2
ALSO DOING SCR EVALUATIONS OF

02:51:09.459 --> 02:51:11.695 region:rollup2
DOING IT WILL SAVE.

02:51:09.893 --> 02:51:12.329 region:rollup2
ARE THEY DIVERGE.

02:51:11.695 --> 02:51:14.030 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE DIVERGING WE'VE GOT A

02:51:12.329 --> 02:51:15.732 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE'VE GOT OF POLLITT

02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:17.567 region:rollup2
BACK AND SEE WHERE WE ARE IF

02:51:15.732 --> 02:51:18.068 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT DIVERGING.

02:51:17.567 --> 02:51:20.971 region:rollup2
WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO

02:51:18.068 --> 02:51:23.573 region:rollup2
FEELING.

02:51:20.971 --> 02:51:25.208 region:rollup2
FEELING THAT.

02:51:23.573 --> 02:51:26.776 region:rollup2
IN TO IT THAT THIS IS IN THE

02:51:25.208 --> 02:51:28.378 region:rollup2
RIGHT PLACE NO WE COMMITTED.

02:51:26.776 --> 02:51:30.213 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD COME BACK TO THE

02:51:28.378 --> 02:51:32.749 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TWO YEARS AFTER

02:51:30.213 --> 02:51:35.118 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATES.

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:37.120 region:rollup2
TO REPORT ON.

02:51:35.118 --> 02:51:39.523 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY OF BOTH THE AMOUNTS

02:51:37.120 --> 02:51:41.958 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD BUDGETED.

02:51:39.523 --> 02:51:43.793 region:rollup2
AND THE.

02:51:41.958 --> 02:51:45.962 region:rollup2
WHETHER KIDS ARE WHAT FAMILIES

02:51:43.793 --> 02:51:47.430 region:rollup2
WERE WINDING UP GETTING BRIGHTER

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:49.232 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY NEED TO KIDS AND

02:51:47.430 --> 02:51:51.234 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THEIR CAREGIVERS.

02:51:49.232 --> 02:51:52.869 region:rollup2
SO WE WILL DO THAT THESE ARE I

02:51:51.234 --> 02:51:54.304 region:rollup2
MEAN AS LUPUS IS ALSO TO SET

02:51:52.869 --> 02:51:55.872 region:rollup2
THESE ARE INTERIM RATES IT'S AN

02:51:54.304 --> 02:51:57.574 region:rollup2
INTERIM TOOL.

02:51:55.872 --> 02:51:59.409 region:rollup2
BUT WOULD YOU START SOMEWHERE

02:51:57.574 --> 02:52:00.043 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T START DON'T START

02:51:59.409 --> 02:52:02.112 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T STOP WE. DON'T GET

02:52:00.043 --> 02:52:04.014 region:rollup2
IT DONE.

02:52:02.112 --> 02:52:05.248 region:rollup2
INDULGE ME IF YOU CAN THEN

02:52:04.014 --> 02:52:06.783 region:rollup2
BROUGHT BECAUSE THIS IS APRIL

02:52:05.248 --> 02:52:09.152 region:rollup2
ELEVENTH AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A

START DATE OF MAY FIRST. IS IT

02:52:09.152 --> 02:52:12.722 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE FOR ME IN TERMS OF NEXT

02:52:11.154 --> 02:52:15.158 region:rollup2
STEPS FOR US.

02:52:12.722 --> 02:52:17.627 region:rollup2
TO HAVE OUR STAFF BE BRIEFED AND

02:52:15.158 --> 02:52:18.995 region:rollup2

RESEARCHERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

02:52:21.131 --> 02:52:25.235 region:rollup2
THE. LOC TOOL.

02:52:23.633 --> 02:52:27.437 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FIRSTHAND

02:52:25.235 --> 02:52:27.971 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN AND CANNOT.

02:52:27.437 --> 02:52:30.140 region:rollup2
DELIVER BY THE END OF THIS

02:52:27.971 --> 02:52:31.641 region:rollup2
MONTH.

02:52:30.140 --> 02:52:33.210 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN WE HAD A

02:52:31.641 --> 02:52:34.644 region:rollup2
MEETING SCHEDULED LAST WEEK

02:52:33.210 --> 02:52:35.412 region:rollup2
WHICH I CANCELED ON MY NOTE

02:52:34.644 --> 02:52:37.714 region:rollup2
CAUSED A BIT OF A FALSE SIX WE

02:52:35.412 --> 02:52:40.317 region:rollup2
HAD SO LITTLE DATA IN YET. THAT

02:52:37.714 --> 02:52:41.151 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THREE IN

02:52:40.317 --> 02:52:43.286 region:rollup2

TWO WEEKS FROM NOW WE'LL BE

02:52:47.757 --> 02:52:49.492 region:rollup2
REPUBLIC OF.

02:52:48.525 --> 02:52:51.361 region:rollup2
FIFTY

02:52:49.492 --> 02:52:51.928 region:rollup2
SIXTY

02:52:51.361 --> 02:52:53.697 region:rollup2
WE WILL WE WILL LIKELY HAVE

02:52:51.928 --> 02:52:55.732 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:52:53.697 --> 02:52:58.635 region:rollup2
ON ALL OF THE EIGHTY CASES

02:52:55.732 --> 02:53:00.303 region:rollup2
SCORED AT LEAST ONCE YEAH BOTH

02:52:58.635 --> 02:53:02.305 region:rollup2
ONE RAIDER IN THAT. IN WITHIN

02:53:00.303 --> 02:53:04.441 region:rollup2
THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND LIKELY

02:53:02.305 --> 02:53:06.309 region:rollup2
AT LEAST TWO RAIDERS FOR EACH OF

02:53:04.441 --> 02:53:08.578 region:rollup2
THE EIGHTY CASE SO WE WERE

02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:09.179 region:rollup2
BEGINNING TO SEIZE UP BUT AGAIN

02:53:08.578 --> 02:53:09.613 region:rollup2
I I REALLY WANT TO BE. CAREFUL

02:53:09.179 --> 02:53:11.047 region:rollup2
SIR

02:53:09.613 --> 02:53:12.148 region:rollup2
THAT IT THAT WE DON'T.

02:53:11.047 --> 02:53:14.184 region:rollup2
LATER I HAVE A FEELING THAT WE

02:53:12.148 --> 02:53:15.685 region:rollup2
DIDN'T LIVE UP TO SOMETHING IN

02:53:14.184 --> 02:53:17.254 region:rollup2
BRIEFING THE STAFF AT CENTER

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:18.722 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS SAYING.

02:53:17.254 --> 02:53:19.823 region:rollup2
AUTUMN.

02:53:18.722 --> 02:53:21.625 region:rollup2
WE'RE REALLY PUTTING IT OFF I

02:53:19.823 --> 02:53:23.260 region:rollup2
MEAN WITWER BRIEFING SO THAT

02:53:21.625 --> 02:53:23.793 region:rollup2
EVERYONE GETS A GROWING SENSE OF

02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:26.463 region:rollup2
AWARENESS AS TO WHAT WE'RE

02:53:23.793 --> 02:53:31.234 region:rollup2
DOING.

02:53:26.463 --> 02:53:32.836 region:rollup2
.

02:53:31.234 --> 02:53:36.039 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SOMETHING

02:53:32.836 --> 02:53:37.440 region:rollup2
FROM THE DYESS IS A.

02:53:36.039 --> 02:53:39.209 region:rollup2
OF FRUSTRATION FROM FEELING AS

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:41.411 region:rollup2
HAVE WE BEEN INCLUDED IN SOME OF

02:53:39.209 --> 02:53:42.846 region:rollup2
THIS DISCUSSION SO THAT WE CAN

02:53:41.411 --> 02:53:44.347 region:rollup2
GET TO THE SAME COMFORT LEVEL

02:53:42.846 --> 02:53:46.449 region:rollup2
THAT IT APPEARS THAT YOU ARE AT.

02:53:44.347 --> 02:53:48.518 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK IS

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:50.320 region:rollup2
AN ABILITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

02:53:48.518 --> 02:53:51.922 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCUSSIONS THIS MONTH.

02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:53.089 region:rollup2
BEFORE ANYTHING IS IMPLEMENTED

02:53:51.922 --> 02:53:54.958 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN BETTER GET A

02:53:53.089 --> 02:53:57.093 region:rollup2
SENSE OF.

02:53:54.958 --> 02:54:00.196 region:rollup2
DIRECTIONS REGARDING THIS TOOL

02:53:57.093 --> 02:54:02.299 region:rollup2
AND ALLEN.

02:54:00.196 --> 02:54:04.034 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK AGAIN THAT WE BE ABLE

02:54:02.299 --> 02:54:06.136 region:rollup2
TO MEET OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TO

02:54:04.034 --> 02:54:08.204 region:rollup2
TO SPEND THE APPROPRIATE TIME

02:54:06.136 --> 02:54:09.339 region:rollup2
THAT'S NECESSARY. TO GET A

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:10.974 region:rollup2
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S

02:54:09.339 --> 02:54:12.909 region:rollup2
BEFORE US IN.

02:54:10.974 --> 02:54:13.943 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:14.444 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR A START DATE OF

02:54:13.943 --> 02:54:17.547 region:rollup2
JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY

02:54:14.444 --> 02:54:19.249 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

02:54:17.547 --> 02:54:22.352 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING

02:54:19.249 --> 02:54:23.787 region:rollup2
TO UNDERTAKE IS SIGNIFICANT AND.

02:54:22.352 --> 02:54:25.922 region:rollup2
YET I BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE TO

02:54:23.787 --> 02:54:27.657 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT CONTINGENCIES.

02:54:25.922 --> 02:54:31.761 region:rollup2
AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE

02:54:27.657 --> 02:54:33.530 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO IN.

02:54:31.761 --> 02:54:34.064 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO THE SIX MAJOR

02:54:33.530 --> 02:54:35.131 region:rollup2
REFORMS THAT WE HAD TALKED

02:54:34.064 --> 02:54:36.399 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:54:35.131 --> 02:54:38.301 region:rollup2
BUT IF THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY

02:54:36.399 --> 02:54:40.370 region:rollup2
TO COME UP WITH CONTINGENCY PLAN

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:40.970 region:rollup2
JUST IN CASE.

02:54:40.370 --> 02:54:41.938 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US

02:54:40.970 --> 02:54:44.107 region:rollup2
TO.

02:54:41.938 --> 02:54:45.909 region:rollup2
REALIZE THAT WHILE WE ASPIRE TO.

02:54:44.107 --> 02:54:48.111 region:rollup2
THIS DREAM.

02:54:45.909 --> 02:54:50.146 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT NOT BE REALIZABLE

02:54:48.111 --> 02:54:56.286 region:rollup2
BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND HAVE

02:54:50.146 --> 02:54:59.322 region:rollup2
TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THAT.

02:54:56.286 --> 02:55:01.558 region:rollup2
IF I SAID WHAT DID MY MIND.

02:54:59.322 --> 02:55:02.926 region:rollup2
WASN'T WORKING HAD CONTINUED IT

02:55:01.558 --> 02:55:04.361 region:rollup2
OUT OBVIOUSLY NOT.

02:55:02.926 --> 02:55:05.996 region:rollup2
LOSE MY CREDIBILITY ARM.

02:55:04.361 --> 02:55:07.297 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I THINK ANY

02:55:05.996 --> 02:55:09.499 region:rollup2
CONTINGENCIES WE LOOK AT HALF

02:55:07.297 --> 02:55:11.134 region:rollup2
BAD INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES

02:55:09.499 --> 02:55:12.702 region:rollup2
THAT WERE BUILT IN SO THAT WE

02:55:11.134 --> 02:55:15.171 region:rollup2
DON'T WIND UP.

02:55:12.702 --> 02:55:17.440 region:rollup2
CREATING PERVERSE INCENTIVES

02:55:15.171 --> 02:55:18.641 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY ARM. I'M

02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:20.744 region:rollup2
I'M. A MEMBER OF READING ONCE

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:23.747 region:rollup2
THAT OF THE GENERAL EISENHOWER

02:55:20.744 --> 02:55:25.915 region:rollup2
HAD PANS A. SPEECH TO GIVE IF

02:55:23.747 --> 02:55:27.717 region:rollup2
THE INVASION HAD FAILED ALL SO

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:30.687 region:rollup2
GOOD I DON'T THINK ANYONE

THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE I CAN SAY

03:04:47.443 --> 03:04:50.446 region:rollup2
MEAN CHOICES AS PROVEN I THINK

03:04:49.178 --> 03:04:52.648 region:rollup2
WHY THIS IS SUCH A VALUABLE

03:04:50.446 --> 03:04:54.383 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. AND SO NEEDED IF WE

03:04:52.648 --> 03:04:55.251 region:rollup2
TRULY WANT TO STEP KIDS DOWN OUT

03:04:54.383 --> 03:04:57.119 region:rollup2
OF GROUP HOMES WE NEED

03:04:55.251 --> 03:04:58.087 region:rollup2
CAREGIVERS WHO ARE COMMITTED AND

03:04:57.119 --> 03:04:59.455 region:rollup2
DEDICATED IN THAT WERE

SUPPORTING THE WAY THEY NEEDED

03:04:59.455 --> 03:05:03.759 region:rollup2
TO BE SUPPORTED. I THINK WHAT WE

03:05:01.424 --> 03:05:05.261 region:rollup2
HAVE HAPPENING AGAIN IS AND THE

03:05:03.759 --> 03:05:07.296 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS REDUCING RESOURCES

03:05:05.261 --> 03:05:08.464 region:rollup2
TO A PROGRAM BASED ON TIME LINES

03:05:07.296 --> 03:05:10.533 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN REALLY STOPPING AND

03:05:08.464 --> 03:05:11.767 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE

03:05:10.533 --> 03:05:13.769 region:rollup2
CARE GIVERS AND THE FAMILIES. SO

03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:16.872 region:rollup2
ASKING AGAIN TO SLOW DOWN TO

03:05:13.769 --> 03:05:17.940 region:rollup2
RETHINK THIS CUT AND AND TO KEEP

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:19.375 region:rollup2
THE MONEY AT THE CURRENT LEVEL

03:05:17.940 --> 03:05:21.077 region:rollup2
OF FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS

03:05:19.375 --> 03:05:22.244 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY STILL NEED IT AND

03:05:21.077 --> 03:05:23.446 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT AT A PLACE WHERE YOU

03:05:22.244 --> 03:05:25.715 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH CARE GIVERS TOSTEP

03:05:23.446 --> 03:05:26.549 region:rollup2
CHILDREN DOWN YET. IT'S NOT THE

03:05:25.715 --> 03:05:27.984 region:rollup2
TIME FOR A CUT.

03:05:26.549 --> 03:05:29.685 region:rollup2
AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO ASK THE

03:05:27.984 --> 03:05:31.253 region:rollup2

03:54:14.440 --> 03:54:18.912 region:rollup2
BIT. AS WELL THERE TO DESCRIBE

03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:21.147 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS TO.

03:54:18.912 --> 03:54:23.483 region:rollup2
SO THE TOLL WHERE DEVELOPED.

03:54:21.147 --> 03:54:25.551 region:rollup2
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS WELL

03:54:23.483 --> 03:54:26.953 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN SINCE THE RECESSION

03:54:25.551 --> 03:54:28.354 region:rollup2
THERE THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOP A

03:54:26.953 --> 03:54:30.390 region:rollup2
TOOL CALLED THE KEY INDICATOR

03:54:28.354 --> 03:54:31.624 region:rollup2
TOOL WHICH IS AN ABBREVIATED

03:54:30.390 --> 03:54:33.059 region:rollup2
TOLL.

03:54:31.624 --> 03:54:34.294 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AS YOU I'M SURE

03:54:33.059 --> 03:54:35.461 region:rollup2
YOU'RE AWARE THEY HAD THE

03:54:34.294 --> 03:54:37.397 region:rollup2
FURLOUGHS IN THE FREEZER SO WAS

03:54:35.461 --> 03:54:39.299 region:rollup2
AN ABBREVIATED TOOL TO BE ABLE

03:54:37.397 --> 03:54:40.466 region:rollup2
TO DO AS MANY INSPECTIONS AS THE

03:54:39.299 --> 03:54:42.535 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT COULD DO.

03:54:40.466 --> 03:54:44.170 region:rollup2
ON AS WE'VE BEEN FINDING OVER

03:54:42.535 --> 03:54:47.740 region:rollup2
TIME.

03:54:44.170 --> 03:54:49.909 region:rollup2
THE TOOL DIDN'T IDENTIFY SOME

03:54:47.740 --> 03:54:51.010 region:rollup2
AREAS OF OF NON COMPLIANCE THAT

03:54:49.909 --> 03:54:53.479 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT WOULD BE MORE

03:54:51.010 --> 03:54:54.347 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE TOOK TO LET US KNOW

03:54:53.479 --> 03:54:56.316 region:rollup2
HAD A TIME WHERE WE COULD.

03:54:54.347 --> 03:54:57.517 region:rollup2
START.

03:54:56.316 --> 03:54:59.786 region:rollup2
HELPING FACILITIES BEFORE THEY

03:54:57.517 --> 03:55:01.354 region:rollup2
GOT TO THE POINT OF BEING ABLE

03:54:59.786 --> 03:55:01.955 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO SHUT THEM DOWN.

03:55:01.354 --> 03:55:03.790 region:rollup2
SO THIS NEW TOOL IS DEVELOPED

03:55:01.955 --> 03:55:05.658 region:rollup2
BY.

03:55:03.790 --> 03:55:07.393 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE ARTICLES IN THE

03:55:05.658 --> 03:55:09.762 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS SO WOULD BE ON.

03:55:07.393 --> 03:55:11.531 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS STAFFING MEDICATIONS

03:55:09.762 --> 03:55:12.999 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL PLANT.

03:55:11.531 --> 03:55:14.534 region:rollup2
PERSONAL RECORDS SO IT'S IT'S

03:55:12.999 --> 03:55:16.002 region:rollup2
DEVELOP SO YOU GET A THREE

03:55:14.534 --> 03:55:17.604 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREE LOOK AT

03:55:16.002 --> 03:55:19.272 region:rollup2
PULSE OF THE FACILITY THE HELP

03:55:17.604 --> 03:55:20.974 region:rollup2
OF THE FACILITY AND SO. IT'S

03:55:19.272 --> 03:55:22.909 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT CAN BE

03:55:20.974 --> 03:55:24.444 region:rollup2
USED AS A SELF ASSESSMENT TOOL

03:55:22.909 --> 03:55:25.545 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY

03:55:24.444 --> 03:55:27.080 region:rollup2
CAN LEARN.

03:55:25.545 --> 03:55:28.581 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE

03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:31.050 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR.

03:55:28.581 --> 03:55:32.452 region:rollup2
IT IT'S IT'S PRETTY AND OUT

03:55:31.050 --> 03:55:34.954 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOT A SPECIALTY TOOL

03:55:32.452 --> 03:55:36.723 region:rollup2
BEHIND EACH OF THOSE AREAS SO IF

03:55:34.954 --> 03:55:38.257 region:rollup2
WE FIND AREA AN ISSUE WITH

03:55:36.723 --> 03:55:39.759 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS. IT'S GOT A

03:55:38.257 --> 03:55:41.194 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY TOOL THAT JUST DIVES

03:55:39.759 --> 03:55:43.396 region:rollup2
DEEP IN THAT AREA SO THAT WE CAN

03:55:41.194 --> 03:55:44.297 region:rollup2
REALLY FIND WHATSOEVER BECAUSE

03:55:43.396 --> 03:55:45.865 region:rollup2
OF WHERE THEY'RE HAVING ISSUES.

03:55:44.297 --> 03:55:47.066 region:rollup2
ON THE TOOLS BEFORE WE DIDN'T

03:55:45.865 --> 03:55:48.701 region:rollup2
EVEN HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE TOOL

03:55:47.066 --> 03:55:50.103 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST.

03:55:48.701 --> 03:55:51.504 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS IT THIS IS SOMETHING

03:55:50.103 --> 03:55:52.905 region:rollup2
THAT WE FEEL IS GONNA BE A

03:55:51.504 --> 03:55:55.141 region:rollup2
PREVENTATIVE TOOL FOR THE

03:55:52.905 --> 03:55:56.476 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS THAT THEY CAN USE THIS

03:55:55.141 --> 03:55:57.243 region:rollup2
TRAINING AROUND STAFF IN IT AND

03:55:56.476 --> 03:55:59.112 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT.

03:55:57.243 --> 03:56:01.314 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE A TRANSPARENT

03:55:59.112 --> 03:56:03.016 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS

03:56:01.314 --> 03:56:04.250 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE MET WITH THEM

03:56:03.016 --> 03:56:05.885 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT THE TOOL RIGHT NOW

03:56:04.250 --> 03:56:07.320 region:rollup2
WE'RE LETTING THEM. GET FAMILIAR

03:56:05.885 --> 03:56:08.921 region:rollup2
WITH IT FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE

03:56:07.320 --> 03:56:09.756 region:rollup2
WE START OUR PILOT WHICH WILL BE

03:56:08.921 --> 03:56:11.824 region:rollup2
IN JULY.

03:56:09.756 --> 03:56:12.925 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

03:56:11.824 --> 03:56:14.060 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE

03:56:12.925 --> 03:56:19.932 region:rollup2
EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE

03:56:14.060 --> 03:56:21.100 region:rollup2
NINE.

03:56:19.932 --> 03:56:22.368 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR PAT LEERY I'M TO

03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:24.037 region:rollup2
KEPT DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

03:56:22.368 --> 03:56:25.905 region:rollup2
SERVICES I ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO

03:56:24.037 --> 03:56:26.939 region:rollup2
THE SECOND VCP FIRST YEAR WHICH

03:56:25.905 --> 03:56:28.307 region:rollup2
IS THE PRIVATE ALTERNATIVE

03:56:26.939 --> 03:56:31.444 region:rollup2
BOARDING SCHOOLS.

03:56:28.307 --> 03:56:33.279 region:rollup2
THIS IS ABOUT THE RESULTS OF A

03:56:31.444 --> 03:56:35.148 region:rollup2
BILL PASSED BY SENATOR THE

03:56:33.279 --> 03:56:36.616 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THAT WITH MY SENATOR

03:56:35.148 --> 03:56:39.919 region:rollup2
LARA TWO YEARS AGO.

03:56:36.616 --> 03:56:41.921 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRES US TO NOW LICENSE

03:56:39.919 --> 03:56:43.189 region:rollup2
PRIVATE THERAPEUTIC BOARDING

03:56:41.921 --> 03:56:44.957 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND WILDERNESS CAMPS

03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:46.592 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ENTIRELY NEW CATEGORY

03:56:44.957 --> 03:56:48.895 region:rollup2
FOR US.

03:56:46.592 --> 03:56:50.963 region:rollup2
THESE ARE FACILITIES THAT HOLD

03:56:48.895 --> 03:56:52.765 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OUT AS BEING

03:56:50.963 --> 03:56:54.067 region:rollup2
THERAPEUTIC IN NATURE IN OTHER

03:56:52.765 --> 03:56:56.436 region:rollup2
WORDS THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE

03:56:54.067 --> 03:56:57.203 region:rollup2
SOME SORT OF MILIEU THAT

03:56:56.436 --> 03:56:59.739 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

03:56:57.203 --> 03:57:01.307 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH.

03:56:59.739 --> 03:57:02.575 region:rollup2
TROUBLED TEENS HIS THEY'VE OFTEN

03:57:01.307 --> 03:57:03.910 region:rollup2
BEEN BEEN.

03:57:02.575 --> 03:57:06.512 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZED.

03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:07.513 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION

03:57:06.512 --> 03:57:09.382 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT BILL WENT THROUGH THE

03:57:07.513 --> 03:57:10.883 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ABOUT INAPPROPRIATE

03:57:09.382 --> 03:57:12.652 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES AT THESE.

03:57:10.883 --> 03:57:13.586 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AND THE FACT THAT

03:57:12.652 --> 03:57:14.454 region:rollup2
THEY WEREN'T LICENSE THEY

03:57:13.586 --> 03:57:17.323 region:rollup2
WEREN'T USING.

03:57:14.454 --> 03:57:19.292 region:rollup2
LICENSED STAFF I'M OR CERTIFIED

03:57:17.323 --> 03:57:22.729 region:rollup2
STAFF IN THE PROCESS.

03:57:19.292 --> 03:57:23.563 region:rollup2
AND SO. IT BITS THESE TWO NEW

03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:25.264 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES WHICH ARE VERY

03:57:23.563 --> 03:57:26.699 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAT SOMEHOW OF

03:57:25.264 --> 03:57:28.334 region:rollup2
REGULAR FACILITIES OTHERS ARE

03:57:26.699 --> 03:57:29.202 region:rollup2
LITERALLY OUT IN THE WOODS OR

03:57:28.334 --> 03:57:31.003 region:rollup2
THE MOUNTAINS.

03:57:29.202 --> 03:57:32.305 region:rollup2
REQUIRES US TO CREATE A NEW

03:57:31.003 --> 03:57:33.806 region:rollup2
LICENSING.

03:57:32.305 --> 03:57:35.641 region:rollup2
SCHEMA FOR THAT.

03:57:33.806 --> 03:57:37.510 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL GIVES US TWELVE

03:57:35.641 --> 03:57:38.111 region:rollup2
PERHAPS STAFF IN ORDER TO DO

03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:39.412 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:57:38.111 --> 03:57:40.346 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ABOUT A MILLION

03:57:39.412 --> 03:57:42.815 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

03:57:40.346 --> 03:57:44.984 region:rollup2
ALLOWS US TO DO WERE POINTED TO

03:57:42.815 --> 03:57:46.519 region:rollup2
USE OUR GROUP HOME REGULATIONS

03:57:44.984 --> 03:57:48.221 region:rollup2
AS THE BASIS ARE NOT GONNA WRITE

03:57:46.519 --> 03:57:49.522 region:rollup2
IT FROM SCRATCH WE'RE GONNA

03:57:48.221 --> 03:57:51.624 region:rollup2
START WITH THAT.

03:57:49.522 --> 03:57:52.692 region:rollup2
AND THEN ADD ON TO THAT AS

03:57:51.624 --> 03:57:54.827 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

03:57:52.692 --> 03:57:56.362 region:rollup2
THESE ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT IN

03:57:54.827 --> 03:57:57.697 region:rollup2
THAT THESE ARE NOT.

03:57:56.362 --> 03:57:59.098 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY OPERATING FACILITIES

03:57:57.697 --> 03:58:00.533 region:rollup2
WHO ARE COMING FORWARD SAYING

03:57:59.098 --> 03:58:02.635 region:rollup2
WE'D LIKE TO BE LICENSED WE'D

03:58:00.533 --> 03:58:04.270 region:rollup2
LIKE TO HAVE LICENSURE FOR THE

03:58:02.635 --> 03:58:06.572 region:rollup2
MOST PART THEY ARE.

03:58:04.270 --> 03:58:08.941 region:rollup2
WE MAY HAVE TO DO A LOT OF

03:58:06.572 --> 03:58:10.343 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TO DISCOVER WHERE

03:58:08.941 --> 03:58:13.479 region:rollup2
THESE FACILITIES ACTUALLY ARE.

03:58:10.343 --> 03:58:15.014 region:rollup2
AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

03:58:13.479 --> 03:58:18.050 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND.

03:58:15.014 --> 03:58:18.885 region:rollup2
SEARCHING OUT BOTH INTERNET

03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:20.019 region:rollup2
CHAT ROOMS.

03:58:18.885 --> 03:58:21.621 region:rollup2
TO FIND WHERE THESE THESE

03:58:20.019 --> 03:58:23.022 region:rollup2
FACILITIES MAIN FACT BE

03:58:21.621 --> 03:58:24.690 region:rollup2
OPERATING WE ALSO BELIEVE

03:58:23.022 --> 03:58:26.425 region:rollup2
THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF

03:58:24.690 --> 03:58:27.927 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL LEGAL ACTIVITY.

03:58:26.425 --> 03:58:28.728 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR

03:58:27.927 --> 03:58:30.363 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS.

03:58:28.728 --> 03:58:32.398 region:rollup2
CONCERNS SOME.

03:58:30.363 --> 03:58:33.933 region:rollup2
THESE FACILITIES IN THE PAST

03:58:32.398 --> 03:58:35.001 region:rollup2
HAVE INDICATED THEY WERE

03:58:33.933 --> 03:58:37.170 region:rollup2
OPERATING AS A FAITH BASED.

03:58:35.001 --> 03:58:37.703 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION WHICH WE DON'T

03:58:37.170 --> 03:58:40.006 region:rollup2
REGULATE.

03:58:37.703 --> 03:58:42.175 region:rollup2
I HAVE AND SO FINING THE

03:58:40.006 --> 03:58:43.709 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION A DIFFERENCE THERE.

03:58:42.175 --> 03:58:45.444 region:rollup2
IS GONNA TAKE SOME LEGAL WORK

03:58:43.709 --> 03:58:46.712 region:rollup2
AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THIS

03:58:45.444 --> 03:58:48.781 region:rollup2
IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF A

03:58:46.712 --> 03:58:50.483 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT WE DO NOT

03:58:48.781 --> 03:58:53.152 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE ANY REAL

03:58:50.483 --> 03:58:55.588 region:rollup2
INDICATION OF WHAT THE SIZE AND

03:58:53.152 --> 03:58:56.856 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF IT WOULD BE.

03:58:55.588 --> 03:59:00.193 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED WE

03:58:56.856 --> 03:59:02.161 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO CONSIDERABLE WORK IN

03:59:00.193 --> 03:59:03.729 region:rollup2
ORDER TO GET STARTED ON IT. FROM

03:59:02.161 --> 03:59:07.133 region:rollup2
WE USE THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:59:03.729 --> 03:59:08.668 region:rollup2
EDUCATION'S LIST OF PRIVATE

03:59:07.133 --> 03:59:11.504 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

03:59:08.668 --> 03:59:13.673 region:rollup2
AS A SET UP AS A STARTING POINT

03:59:11.504 --> 03:59:14.874 region:rollup2
TO SEE HOW MANY MIGHT FALL INTO

03:59:13.673 --> 03:59:17.009 region:rollup2
THAT CATEGORY.

03:59:14.874 --> 03:59:19.779 region:rollup2
BUT UNTIL WE'RE ACTUALLY IN

03:59:17.009 --> 03:59:23.316 region:rollup2
THIS WE WON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW

03:59:19.779 --> 03:59:24.250 region:rollup2
MANY THESE FACILITIES ARE GONNA

03:59:23.316 --> 03:59:26.152 region:rollup2
COME UNDER OUR REGULATION.

03:59:24.250 --> 03:59:27.587 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MA'AM.

03:59:26.152 --> 03:59:28.254 region:rollup2
NEXT PCB OKAY THE NEXT ONE IS

03:59:27.587 --> 03:59:30.122 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ON.

03:59:28.254 --> 03:59:30.723 region:rollup2
IT IT'S FROM OUR ADMINISTRATION

03:59:30.122 --> 03:59:32.491 region:rollup2

AND LATER FOLLOWED BY THE

03:59:35.995 --> 03:59:39.432 region:rollup2
OCTOBER FIRES AND MUD SLIDES.

03:59:37.396 --> 03:59:41.534 region:rollup2

STATE WE RECOGNIZE WE HAD SOME

03:59:53.579 --> 03:59:56.315 region:rollup2
