THAT TYPE IN NATURE OF THERE WAS

00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:35.833
A DISCRETIONARY FUNDING WE

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.602
DEFINITELY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE.

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:38.402

TO TAILOR OUR ADVOCACY BASED ON

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:45.843
WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET AND SO THIS

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.345
YEAR'S BUDGET DOESN'T HAVE THE

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:50.114

THEY DID.

00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:58.923

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.725
BE -- SOMETHING WE SHARED WITH

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.126

THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TRIAL

COURT JUDGES -- WE UNDERSTAND

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.538
THAT THIS YEAR THE JUDICIAL

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:12.857

CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTER

ASSOCIATION FIRST OF ALL I WANT

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:30.447
TO THANK.

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:31.681
THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:34.351
LEGISLATURE FOR THE DIRECTIVE TO

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.219
ALLOCATE MONEY FOR FAMILY LAW --

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.054
COURT REPORTERS AND THAT WAS

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:40.090
ABSOLUTELY NEEDED -- WAS VERY

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:43.293
HELPFUL AND WE HOPE THAT THAT --

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.628
THAT THERE IT IS.

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.429
WE HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP AS

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:47.330
TO WHERE THAT MONEY WAS SPENT

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.532
KIND OF REALLY DRILL DOWN ON

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:49.866
THAT HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOCATE

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:50.967
ADDITIONAL MONEY.

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:52.402
LET ME ADD A COUPLE OF THINGS

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:53.169
WE'RE FINDING AND SOME OF THE

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:53.937
COURTS.

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.373
IS THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT SAID

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:59.543
THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE USED TO

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.044
SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLANT.

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:03.346
ENCORE REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW I

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:04.548
WAS KIND OF RED LOW BUT NARROWLY

00:53:04.614 --> 00:53:08.451
THESE WERE HER ON THE GROUND AND

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:10.287
THAT IS TO SUPPLEMENT -- FOR

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:12.022
FAMILY LAW CASES AND SO WHAT

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:13.590
WE'VE SEEN IN SOME QUARTERS KIND

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.292
OF A SHIFTING AROUND THEY MAY.

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:16.960
THEY MAY ADD COURT REPORTERS AND

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:18.962
PAY FOR IT -- CORPORATE OF HIM

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.463
ON PAY FOR OUT OF THE THE

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.032
DISCRETIONARY MONEY.

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.533
BUT THOSE COURT REPORTERS WERE

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.604
IN HANDLING OTHER CASES SO THEY

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:28.138
THEY DIDN'T.

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:30.206
SUPPLANT FAMILY LAW CORD PORTERS

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:31.975
BUT THE SUPPLANTED HARPER'S

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.343
OVERALL SO I THINK NEED TO BE

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.812
CLEAR THAT THE DIRECTIVE IS.

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.047
TO SUPPLEMENT THE TOTAL NUMBER

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.715
OF COURT REPORTERS IN THE

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.984
COURTHOUSE AS OPPOSED TO JUST

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.352
SUPPLEMENT THE NUMBER OF COURT

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:44.020
PERSONALLY FAMILY LAW.

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:44.654
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.822
GOING FORWARD.

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:46.957
THE OTHER THING TO LOOK AT GOING

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:49.259
FORWARD IS WHY YOU EVEN HAVE TO

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:49.826
ASK FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:50.727
FAMILY LAW.

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:52.996
KEEP IN MIND YOU SHOULD LOOK AT

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:54.030
HOW.

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:55.432
MONEY IS ALLOCATED RIGHT NOW

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:56.967
THAT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE FOR

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:58.201
COURT REPORTERS EVERY TIME

00:53:58.268 --> 00:54:00.370
THERE'S A JUDICIAL SLOT THERE'S

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:00.971
MONEY THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:03.173
PROVIDED. FOR STAFF FOR MONEY IS

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.741
PROVIDED FOR STAFF TO SUPPORT

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.109
THE JUDICIAL POSITION.

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.677
WHAT WE'RE FINDING THAT THEN YOU

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:08.678
WOULD EXPECT THAT THE RECORD

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:10.513
QUARTER FOR EVERY JUDGE --

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.848
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.650
CASE IN FACTIF YOU WALK SIX

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.085
BLOCKS FROM HERE.

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:16.453
THE COURT REPORTERS HAVE BEEN

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.954
YOU KNOW SCRAMBLING BECAUSE

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.322
THERE ARE COURT ROOMS THAT ARE

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.057
CLOSED EVERY DAY.

00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:22.993
HALF A DAY SOMETIMES A FULL DAY.

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.127
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO COURT

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:25.862
REPORTERS FOR THOSE COURT ROOMS.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.664
SO THAT'S A PROBLEM THERE ARE A

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:29.099
NUMBER OF REVENUE STREAMS

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:30.934
ALREADY IN PLACE TO ENSURE THEIR

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:32.736
CORE PORTS AVAILABLE BUT PART OF

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:33.670
THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE TO ADD

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:34.838
MONEY IS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:36.539
QUESTIONS OF HOW WE'RE MANAGING

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:39.075
THE MONEY NOW -- LET ME JUST.

SUMMON UP THAT AS YOU ALSO LOOK

AT THIS KEEP IN MIND THAT COURT

REPORTERS ARE THERE TRYING TO

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:46.182
HIRE THEM.

THEIR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES --

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:14.403

ADJUSTMENT WAS.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.354

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:53.709
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:54.910
CALIFORNIA LAW ONLY ALLOWS THE

HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL --

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.312
THERE IS COUNTIES THROUGHOUT

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.647
CALIFORNIA HAVE ADOPTED SOME

FORM OF PRE TRIAL CHANGE SUMMER

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.484
MORE EXTENSIVE LIKE SANTA CLARA --

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.752
AS MISTER ROGERS WILL SPEAK

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:25.120

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:26.689
ARE SMALLER MORE INCREMENTAL

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:27.690
CHANGES SO THINGS ARE REALLY

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:28.857
HAPPENING.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.593
WHAT THIS PILOT WOULD SUGGEST

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.861
DOING IS -- HAVING COURT

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:35.864
PROGRAMS IN EIGHT TO TEN COURTS --

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:37.466
THAT'LL BE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE IN

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.801
IN THOSE COURT RECORDS WHAT WE

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.169
ANTICIPATE HAPPENING IS IS

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:41.637
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE THE

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.005
COUNTIES WITH PARDON ME THE

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.174
COURT AND PROBATION -- BILL

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.142

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:48.978
UNDER EXISTING LAW AS IT IS

RIGHT NOW -- RISK ASSESSMENTS

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:52.681
WILL BE CONDUCTED AND DECISIONS

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.083
WILL BE MADE PRE ARRANGEMENT AND

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.517
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE FRAMEWORK

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:56.685
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.487
THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AT

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.322
THEIR MOST BASIC LEVEL.

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:02.858
OUR TO FUND PRACTICES AND AND

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.927
PROGRAMS THAT WILL PROMOTE

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:09.632
PUBLIC SAFETY AND RETURN TO

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:10.866
COURT -- THAT WILL FOR SO LET'S

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:11.533
TAKE A QUICK DECISION MAKING --

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.468
SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:13.102

RELEASED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.405
BECAUSE I THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.773
WELL AWARE OF THE DETRIMENTAL

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.408
EFFECTS AFFECTS THAT INDIVIDUALS

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:20.042

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.644
WHEN THEY WERE DETAINED -- WHEN

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.178
WHEN THEY COULD BE RELEASED

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.813
SAFELY AND AND SOONER

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.981
ADDITIONALLY -- WE WANT TO

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.816
MINIMIZE BIAS IN THESE DECISION

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.551
MAKING -- AND WE WANT TO

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:31.153
EVALUATE THESE PROGRAMS -- IN

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.621
ORDER TO GAIN A MUCH BETTER

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.223
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WORKS --

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:35.591
SO THAT IT CAN BE REPLICATED AND

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.493
WHAT DOESN'T WORK SO THAT WE CAN

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:38.927
AVOID THOSE PRACTICES.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:40.496
IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMS

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.297
THAT WE ANTICIPATE BEING FUNDED --

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.432
WE IMAGINE CONTRACTS BETWEEN

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:45.501
COURTS AND PROBATION IN ORDER TO

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.969
CONDUCT THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS A

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.937
JUDICIAL OFFICER RELEASED PRIOR

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.072
TO RELATE ARRAIGNMENT AS I

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.240
MENTIONED BEFORE.

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:52.708
VALIDATION OF RISK ASSESSMENT

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.243
TOOLS RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.978
BEING USED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.279
RIGHT NOW VERY FEW OF THOSE

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.947
TOOLS OF ACTUALLY BEEN VALIDATED

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.549
ON THEIR LOCAL POPULATIONS AND

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:01.483
SO PART OF THIS PROGRAM WILL

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:02.217
ALSO.

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:03.952
RESULT IN THE VALIDATION OF SOME

01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:05.054
OF THE MAJOR TOOLS.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.056
DATA EXCHANGES BETWEEN LOCAL

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.757
JUSTICE SYSTEM PARTNERS AGAIN SO

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.059
THAT THOSE DECISIONS CAN BE MADE

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.094
QUICKLY AND ALSO DATA EXCHANGES

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.962
BETWEEN THE COURTS AND THE

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.431
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS IT RELATES

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.465
TO PRE TRIAL SO THAT WE ARE

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:17.866
GOING TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.368
THESE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE.

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.602

MAKE THESE POLICY DECISIONS AND

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:25.407
THEN THINGS LIKE COURT REMINDERS --

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:26.742
BUT I I THINK IT IS THAT IT'S

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:27.910
EVIDENT THAT COURT REMINDERS

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.578
WORK -- IN THE SAME WAY THAT

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.280
RESTAURANT REMINDERS WORK OR

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:32.748
HAIR CUT REMINDERS WORK COURT

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:33.849
REMINDERS WORK AND SO REALLY

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:35.017
ENHANCING SOME OF THOSE

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.452
REMINDERS.

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:40.589
IN TERMSOF HOW THE COURTS WILL

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:41.557
BE SELECTED.

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:42.558
THE CHIEF JUSTICE VERY RECENTLY

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.159

COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.004
THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER --

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:57.740
SHOULD THIS BE INCLUDED IN THE

01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.742
FINAL BUDGET -- THAT WOULD THAT

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.276
WORK GROUP HAS ALREADY STARTED

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.711
ITS WORK IN ANTICIPATION OF THE

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.379
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS MIGHT BE

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.415

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:14.156
PARAMETERS WILL BE BUT IT JUST

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.091
IN ANTICIPATION OF TRYING TO GET

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.392
THE FUNDS OUT AS QUICKLY AS

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:18.827
POSSIBLE THAT GROUP HAS BEGUN

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:21.163
WORK -- THAT'LL BE EIGHT TO TEN

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.064
COURTS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT A

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.599
DIVERSITY OF COURTS IN TERMS OF

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:26.435
COURT SIZE AND LOCATION NORTHERN

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.804
SOUTHERN CENTRAL -- COASTAL WE

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:29.972
WANT TO LOOK AT A VARIETY OF

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:31.173
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS COURT

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.408
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS SO THAT

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:35.477
TOOLS THAT WE LEARNED OF AND AT

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:36.845

MARKETPLACE ENSURING THAT WE

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.194
HAVE A VARIETY OF THOSE TOOLS

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:52.394
THAT.

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.263
ARE REPRESENTED ALSO -- I

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:55.464

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.032
GOING TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.434
STRONG LOCAL COLLABORATION --

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.337

ANTICIPATES A TWO YEAR PROGRAM

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:13.081
AND SO GETTING UP AND RUNNING AS

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.616
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WILL BE VERY

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:15.350

MEET THE OBJECTIVES TO MEASURE

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.690
THE OBJECTIVES OF OF THE TOOL

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:22.891
QUICKLY I'LL MENTION THE

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:26.361
EVALUATION PLAN -- WE ANTICIPATE --

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.896

PILOTS IN ORDER TO MEASURE ANY

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:41.109
POTENTIAL BIAS -- TO DETERMINE --

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:42.311
IF THE PRE TRIAL PROJECT PRIDE A

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:43.178
A PROJECTS REDUCE PRE TRIAL

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:44.446

IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY TO ENSURE

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.518
THAT THAT HAPPENS ALSO WE HOPE

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:50.853
TO WORK WITH THE PANEL OF OF

01:14:50.919 --> 01:14:53.455
ACADEMICS -- IN ORDER TO HELP US --

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:55.591
WORK ON THAT DESIGN METHODOLOGY

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.025
IN ORDER TO TO INSURE THAT WE

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.694
MEET THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.596
THAT ARE NEEDED AND SO WITH THAT

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.064
I WILL JUST SUM UP BY SAYING --

WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:05.601
ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT OF OF

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:08.070
THIS POSSIBILITY OF OF WORKING --

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:09.972
IN THE COURTS AND AN ORDER TO DO

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.740
A MUCH DEEPER DIVE SO THAT THE

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.542
DAY THAT PRE TRIAL REFORM DOES

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:14.643
COME ALONG IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.444
AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.612
GOING TO LOOK LIKE BEAUSE OF

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:17.579
ALL THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:19.047

THE CHANGES OCCURRING IN

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.691
CALIFORNIA'S PRE TRIAL PROCESS.

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:37.292
HOWEVER HAVE A FEW ISSUES WITH

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:38.327
THE CURRENT WORDING OF THE STATE

FUNDING.

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.231
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE

OVER FIFTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:52.474
COUNTIES.

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.076

PRE TRIAL SERVICES AS A STATED

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.481
EARLIER -- BUT THAT INFORMATION --

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.116
IT BASICALLY COMES FROM A REPORT

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:02.985

ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:14.096
I FEEL THIS IS A MISSTEP IN

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:15.764
ALLOCATION IS A PILOT PROGRAMS

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:17.666
ARE NOT NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA --

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.034
THERE BEEN CONTINUING LIKE I

FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:23.805
THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF ONGOING

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:25.374
EFFORTS ARE.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.875
BY CONTRAST SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:28.810
DOLLARS COULD FUND FIFTY ONE OF

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:29.511
THE FIFTY LOWER POPULATED

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.413
COUNTIES WITH A SIMILAR PREACHER

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.482
SYSTEM AS SUCH AND SENT A CLEAR

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:34.883
AT THIS TIME.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:35.851
SECOND THE LANGUAGE FOLLOW

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.652
SIMILAR FUNDING STRATEGIES

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:38.854
DESCRIBED IN SENATE BILL TEN

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.288
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THE REFERENDUM

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.923
PASSED IN THE SENATE BILL TEN IS

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.458
NOW ON THE BALLOT.

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:44.059
FOR TWENTY TWENTY HOWEVER AS

WITH THE HUMPHRIES BUFF AND WEB

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:48.563
DECISIONS.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:49.798
CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE NEED FOR

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:51.299
THE COUNTIES TO RECEIVE ON GOING

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:52.701
SUPPORT IS THESE DECISIONS HAVE

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:53.869
THE ABILITY TO CHANGE OUR PRE

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:56.271
TRIAL IS ADMINISTERED OVERNIGHT

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.939
VERSES WAITING FOR BALLOT.

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:01.443
OR REFERENDUM INITIATIVE IN.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.077
TWENTY TWENTY AS STATED BEFORE

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.045
THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES WHO

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:04.346
ALREADY HAVE SUCCESSFUL PRE

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.680
TRIAL PROGRAMS IN PLACE IN THIS

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.115
FUNDING WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:08.417
TO SUPPORT.

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:10.185
ALL SUCH PROGRAMMING -- IF LATE

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.787
LIMITED TO JUST COUNTY PROBATION

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:12.687
DEPARTMENTS.

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:13.889
THIS DOES NOT FOLLOW THE

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.090
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE CREATED AND

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:16.825
SENATE BILL TEN AS THERE IS

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:17.959
NOTHING INDICATING COURTS MUST

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.227
CONTRACT WITH PROBATION ONLY

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:20.595
THAT THE COURT MAY NOT CONTRACT

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:22.464
WITH A QUALIFIED AGENCY THAT HAS

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.166
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY. FOR

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.534
MAKING ARRESTED TO TENSIONS

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.002
WITHIN THE JURISDICTION.

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.070
THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANT THE PRE

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:30.338
TRIAL PROCESS IS NOT THE SAME AS

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:32.040
POST ADJUDICATION PROBATION THE

PRE TRIAL FOCUSES ABOUT WORKING

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:34.743
WITH CLIENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.812
SHOW UP FOR COURT.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:37.379
AND ARE NOT A DANGER IN THE

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:37.946
COMMUNITY.

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:38.980
PRE TRIAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE A

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:40.348
SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THE

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:41.983
COMMUNITY AS WELL AS HOLDING THE

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.085
INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABLE AND ARE

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.686
HELD TO A SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:46.088
STANDARDS LIKE PROBATION BASED

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:46.855
ON THE LONG NATIONAL

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.356
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE.

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.858
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION AND

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:52.494
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PRE

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.795
TRIAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:54.996
WE SERVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:55.897
DEALING WITH SIMILAR BUT

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.365
DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS

01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:58.967
AS OUR CLIENTS HAVE NOT BEEN

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.702
CONVICTED OF ANY LAW VIOLATION.

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:02.003
THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.538
ARE DISTINCTLY REVIEWED INTENSE

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:04.840
NOT HE'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:06.108
RESEARCH PUBLICATION PRE TRIAL

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:08.110
RELEASE ON PROBATION WHAT IS THE

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:09.444
SAME AND WHAT IS DIFFERENT.

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:10.712
IF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.047
HAVE NOT REVIEWED THIS MATERIAL

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.215
I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THEY

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.316
BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.318
INFORMATIVE AND FUNDAMENTAL LOOK

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:17.819
AT THE TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES.

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.087
PRIMARILY PREACHER RELEASE

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.089
SHOULD NEVER BE CONFUSED WITH A

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:22.457
RECOGNIZED FORM OF PUNISHMENT.

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:23.725
ONLY SERVING TO ENSURE THE

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.760
CLIENT RETURNS TO COURT AND IS

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:27.129
NOT A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY.

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.396
LASTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THE

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:29.464
JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL BE

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.999
UTILIZING THE FUNDING ALLOCATED

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:32.534
TO THEM. TO BE ABLE TO OVERSEE

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.869
THE PRE TRIAL REFORM EFFORTS IN

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:35.003
CALIFORNIA.

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.138
THERE'S NOT A DESIGNATED

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:38.006
INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP THAT I WAS

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:39.407
AWARE OF AT THIS TIME.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.709
WHO WILL OVERSEE THIS AND

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:41.710
PROVIDE A PLAN ON HOW THE COURTS

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.378
IN PRE TRIAL AGENCIES WILL

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.479
COMMUNICATE THE RESULTS TO THIS

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.448
UNDER UNIDENTIFIED GROUP FOR

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.016
COMPILATION A REVIEW?

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.417
I WOULD SUGGEST PARTNERING WITH

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:50.585
AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY LIKE THE

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:51.953
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRE

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.221
TRIAL SERVICES AS MUCH OF THE

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.689
RESEARCH IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.625
HAS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED BY

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:58.093
MULTIPLE AGENCIES IN THE STATE

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.094
THEY'RE JUST NEEDS TO BE A

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.328
COORDINATED EFFORT TO GATHER AND

01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:02.397
DISSEMINATE THE INFORMATION ALL

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:03.598
PARTIES INVOLVED.

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:04.633
IN CONCLUSION THERE ARE MANY

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:05.600
COUNTIES ARE ALREADY PROVIDING

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:06.902

WORTHWHILE.

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:42.771
WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:44.172
THE LACK OF DETAIL MAKES IT VERY

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.807
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.108
EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE IT AND

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:47.976
WEIGHED AGAINST ITS OTHER

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:50.111
GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES IT'S NOT

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.446
AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.148
SO BECAUSE OF THIS WE DO --

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:54.282
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:55.917
DIRECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.786
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. TO SUBMIT A

01:20:57.852 --> 01:20:59.287
MORE WELL DEVELOPED PROPOSAL BY

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.822
APRIL FOR THE FIFTEENTH FOR

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:03.692
CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:05.560
SPRING BUDGET HEARINGS

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:05.860
[inaudible]

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.162
I'M SORRY [inaudible]

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:08.797
YEAH.

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:11.233
OF AND SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSAL

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.667
SHOULD INCLUDE INFORMATION IN

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:14.636
FOUR KEY AREAS -- SOME OF THEM

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.371
WERE TOUCHED ON IN MISS CURRENTS --

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.173
TESTIMONY BUT I THINK WE WOULD

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.141
NEED ADDITIONAL DETAIL THE FIRST

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.676
AREA IS WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:24.279
GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AND THIS IS

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:25.680
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE

01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:26.948
LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO ENSURE

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.283
THAT THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:29.184
IN A MANNER.

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:31.486
CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.222
THE SECOND AREA -- IS WHAT TYPE

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:36.057
OF PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES WOULD

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:38.293
BE SUPPORTED AND DO THEY MEET

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.795
THOSE PROBLEM THOSE GOALS THAT

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:41.663
WERE IDENTIFIED.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:42.998
THE THIRD AREA IS HOW ALL THE

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:44.733
FUNDING BE ALLOCATED TO ENSURE

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.301
THAT IT'S BEING DONE IN A FAIR

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:47.335
MANNER.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:48.203
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.037
WOULD KNOW IS UNDER THE

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.639
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL MOST

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:51.573
OF THE DECISIONS ARE CURRENTLY

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.841
LAUGHS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:54.276
WHICH MEANS THAT.

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.210
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.544
LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE LITTLE

01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:57.345
EMPLOY.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.347
IN WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE USED

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:01.516
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PRIORITIES.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.451
AND THE FOURTH AND FINAL AREA IS

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:04.519
ACTUALLY THIS ISSUE ABOUT

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.554
EVALUATION -- AND SPECIFICALLY

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:08.290
THERE SHOULD BE DETAILS ON HOW

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.324
THE FUNDED PROGRAMS AND

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:11.926
ACTIVITIES WILL BE EVALUATED IN

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:13.995
A WAY THAT CAN INFORM STATEWIDE

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.063
DECISION MAKING.

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.165
AND SO CUMULATIVELY ALL OF THIS

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:18.833
INFORMATION IS NECESSARY FOR THE

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.335
LEGISLATURE TO EFFECTIVELY

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:21.536
EVALUATE THE PROGRAM.

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.271
AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:25.674
IS STRUCTURED OPERATED AND

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.876
FUNDED IN A WAY THAT MEETS

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:30.145
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES IS

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.880
CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING LEGISLATIVE

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.048
EXPECTATIONS.

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.516
AND THAT THE FUNDING IS USED IN

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.817
AN ACCOUNTABLE MANNER.

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.319
SO WE ARE WITHHOLDING

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:38.453
RECOMMENDATION PENDING THE

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.554
SUBMISSION OF THIS ADDITIONAL

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.089
INFORMATION TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:43.091
THE INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:45.760
WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:48.063
PROPOSAL.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.431
ANY COMMENTS.

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.533
YES PLEASE DON'T.

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:52.467
THANK YOU AT ABSOLUTELY THINK

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:53.902
THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:55.704
BUDGET ALLOCATION HERE AND

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:56.705
CONTINUE TO THE WORK THAT WE

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:59.341
STARTED WITH WITH SB TEN BUT I I

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.242
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE.

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.510
BOTH FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:04.079
THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:06.915
THAT WHAT WE WHAT I THINK WE

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.450
NEED TO BE DOING AND IT IS A

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:09.617
LITTLE HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO DO

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:10.652
WITH THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.721
THE LACK OF DETAIL BUT I THINK

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:13.321
THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:15.623
FLESHED OUT.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:18.159
WE HAVE EXISTING AS WAS POINTED

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:18.760
OUT APPROPRIATELY THERE THERE

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:19.861
ARE.

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.062
A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RISK

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:22.163
ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:23.298
BEING USED AND I THINK THAT

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.432
PROVIDES IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:26.735
BASIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAY OR

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:29.270
MAY BE WORKING ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:30.672
BUT ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WAS

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:32.774
NEGOTIATED OUT ON AT THE REQUEST

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.175
OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:35.243
UNFORTUNATELY WAS DATA

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.644
COLLECTION AND UNFORTUNATELY WE

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:37.946
AGREED TO REMOVE DATA COLLECTION

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:39.347
SO EVEN IF SB.

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:40.548
TEN HAD MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT THE

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:41.950
THAT ABOUT MEASURE PUTTING IT IN

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:42.951
ADVANCE.

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.986
WE WERE NOT SET UP TO GET THE

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:46.688
DATA COLLECTION THAT WE NEED AND

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.057
NOT JUST ABOUT RISK OF FLIGHT

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:50.492
AND SOME OF THOSE PIECES BUT WE

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:51.659
NEED TO MAKE SURE.

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:53.261
THAT AS WE PUT THESE PROGRAMS

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:54.929
TOGETHER AND I THINK WE CAN USE.

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:56.664
SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.533
TEST AGAINST THE BIAS THAT THEY

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.401
REPRESENT.

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:03.004
MEETING WHO'S BEING ALLOWED.

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.105
TO TO LEAVE WHO'S NOT BEING

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:06.474
ALLOWED TO LEAVE BASED ON COLOR

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:08.576
RACE CRIMES POVERTY.

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:10.712
ANY OF THOSE INDICATORS.

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:12.414
THE PRE TRIAL.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.782
THE BAIL SYSTEM CASH MONEY BAIL

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.750
SYSTEM HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.119
IMPACT ON THE THE POOREST OF

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.687
CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN'T AFFORD

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.256
BEAR.

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:22.557
WITH IT AND ABSOLUTELY.

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.359
WRONG HEADED WAY FOR US TO

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:26.861
ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO MAKE

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:28.596
SURE THAT WE ARE HOLDING PEOPLE

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:29.798
APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNTABLE.

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:31.199
AND WE HAVE ENOUGH EXAMPLES I

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:32.567
THINK ACROSS CALIFORNIA BE ABLE

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:33.368
LEVERAGE OFF OF SOME OF THOSE

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:34.936
PROGRAMS THAT'S WHAT I THINK

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.571
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED. FOR

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.006
TO LOOK AT THOSE PROGRAMS AND

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.874
SET UP A STRONGER SYSTEM OF DATA

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:43.645
COLLECTION. TO LOOK AT WHO'S.

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:45.180
WHO IS BEING DETAINED UNDER THIS

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:47.182
RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS WHO'S NOT

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:47.816
TO VALIDATE THE RISK ASSESSMENT

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:49.150
TOOLS?

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.553
PILOT PROGRAMS MAYBE WE CAN USE

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:52.821
THE AS IS QUITE HAVE THE EXIT

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.489
EXISTING PROGRAMS AS THE

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.723
EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM BUT THIS

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.625
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SET

01:24:57.692 --> 01:24:59.627
OURSELVES UP FOR SUCCESS.

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.296
ONCE ASSUMING.

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:03.164
THAT BALLOT MEASURE FAILS AND

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.766
WE'RE ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD ON

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.868
ON PROP.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.570
TEN A WHAT THAT WORLD LOOKS LIKE

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:09.871
BUT EVEN STILL I THINK WE CAN BE

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.439
AS A STATE MAKE A LOT OF

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:13.208
PROGRESS TOWARDS.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:16.010
APPROPRIATE WE LOOKING AT THE

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:18.079
VERSION SERVICES PRE TRIAL

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.415
SERVICE SAYS -- KEEP LOOKING AT

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:21.749
RISKS THAT PEOPLE REALLY

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:22.984
REPRESENT FOR FLIGHT OR NOT

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:25.186
FLIGHT BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:26.754
THAT WAS REYES TONIGHT THAT I

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:28.890
AGREE WITH IS THAT IF WE ARE

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:29.891
CAREFUL.

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.360
WITH THE TOOLS THEY GET USE FOR

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:34.662
THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS.

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:35.964
THE COURTS COULD END UP

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.264
[inaudible]

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:38.066
STILL.

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:40.235
DETAINING REQUIRING THE TENSION

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:42.203
OF PEOPLE OF COLOR PEOPLE OF

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.105
POOR MEANS WITH WITHOUT REALLY

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:46.307
BALANCING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.576
ARE AVAILABLE AND I KNOW A LOT

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:53.381
OF THE COURTS HAS BEEN USING.

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:54.782
A RISK ASSESSMENT TO I THINK TO

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:56.351
SOME GREAT EFFECT IT'S OBVIOUSLY

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:58.119
BACKED BY CASH MONEY BAIL WHICH

01:25:58.186 --> 01:25:59.053
IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO GET

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.855
RID OF BY.

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.757
SOME OF THESE THESE DATA EXIST

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.193
SOME OF THESE TOOLS ARE ABLE TO

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.495
BE ASSESSED IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:08.463
BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:10.031
USED I THINK WE TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:10.698
OF THAT.

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:12.967
AND THEN BE ABLE TO BETTERONCE

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:14.669
WE COME OUT OF THIS BALLOT

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.371
MEASURE CYCLE AND GIVEN THE

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:17.839
LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:19.340
AND USUALLY COUNCIL.

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:21.276
THE THE TIME IN THE MEANTIME AND

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:22.577
SOME RESOURCES TO BE ABLE LOOK

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:24.579
AT THESE PROGRAMS LOOK AT THE

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.214
DATA COLLECTION ASK THE

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:27.682
QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE NEED.

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:28.983
AND REALLY DESIGNED A SYSTEM

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:29.984
THAT WE CAN THEN HIT THE GROUND

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:33.054
RUNNING ONCE THIS QUESTION IS

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:33.421
FINALLY SETTLED.

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.389
SOME.

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.823
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BUDGET OUT

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:37.292
ALLOCATION I'M EXCITED ABOUT

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:38.927
VERY INTERESTED IN AND I WOULD

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:40.595
HOPE THIS COMMITTEE I THINK THIS

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:41.930
COMMITTEE PROBABLY SHARES THIS.

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:45.567
IS I HOPE YOU ARE ALL A PART OF

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:21.128
PLENTY OF TIMES IN THE

SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:23.864
THOSE REVENUES HAVE CONTINUED

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:25.566
DECLINE I WILL JUST NOTE THAT --

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:26.767
YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.001
WELL AWARE OF THIS AND WE ARE

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:30.270
TRACKING AND AND I THINK IN

01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:31.305
RECOGNITION OF THE LA WAS

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:32.839
RECOMMENDATION THAT I THINK MORE

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.141
WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:35.609
HOLISTICALLY BEFORE WE START.

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:37.311
DEPOSITING INDIVIDUAL FINDING

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:39.613
FEES AND TO THE GENERAL FUND --

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.447
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:43.317
MONITORING.

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:44.251
OKAY COMING FROM LA -- WE DON'T

01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:46.153
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE TWO

01:43:46.219 --> 01:43:47.387
PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:48.989
YOUR AGENDA BECAUSE WE DID FIND

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.324
THAT THEY WERE JUSTIFIED ON A

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:51.825
WORKLOAD BASIS AND ARE NEEDED

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:53.327
FOR JUDICIAL BRANCH OPERATIONS.

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:55.362
WE DO HAVE LARGER CONCERNS ABOUT

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:56.463
THE IMPROVEMENT AND

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:59.566
MODERNIZATION FUND -- AND SO ONE

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:01.034
THING THAT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:01.902
IS THAT THIS ONE HAS

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:03.270
CONSISTENTLY HAD OPERATION FOR

01:44:03.337 --> 01:44:05.238
FALLS IN ABSENT ANY ACTIONS OF

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:07.641
LIKELY TO GO INSOLVENT IN.

01:44:07.708 --> 01:44:08.575
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE STATE

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:10.310
HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTIONS AND A

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:11.979
NUMBER OF OTHER YEARS TO HELP

01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:13.714
WITH THE SOLVENCY OF THIS OF FOR

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:14.615
EXAMPLE THE COST OF OTHER

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:16.283
PROGRAMS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.917
SHIFTED TO THE GENERAL FUND AS

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:17.851
WELL.

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:20.087
ON TOP OF THAT AS IS -- IS LAID

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:22.990
OUT ON PAGE TEN OF YOUR AGENDA --

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:24.992
THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.493
LITTLE OVERSIGHT OVER AT THE IMF

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.761
EXPENDITURES THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:29.396
GENERALLY REPORTS AFTER THE

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:30.764
EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN MADE.

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:32.933
AND ON TOP OF THAT THE JUDGE THE

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.234
JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS OFTENTIMES

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:36.870
STRUGGLED TO MATCH EXPENDITURES

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:38.939
TO REVENUES AND AND WE WOULDN'T

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:40.073
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DECLINE IN

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.541
CARMEL FIND A REFER FEE REVENUE

01:44:41.608 --> 01:44:42.909
IS OUTSIDE OF THE JUDICIAL

01:44:42.976 --> 01:44:43.910
BRANCH IS HANDS.

01:44:43.977 --> 01:44:45.879
SO TO ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:47.614
ISSUE ANTEL INCREASE LEGISLATIVE

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:49.116
OVERSIGHT WE DO OFFER THREE

01:44:49.182 --> 01:44:50.283
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:51.652
THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS TO

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.920
DEPOSIT -- I AM F. REVENUES INTO

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:54.955
THE GENERAL FUND ELIMINATE THE

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:56.056
IMF.

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:58.692
THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:58.759 --> 01:44:59.493
TO CONSIDER THE APPROPRIATE

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:01.228
LEVEL OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE TO

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:02.863
THE PROGRAM'S IRRESPECTIVE.

01:45:02.929 --> 01:45:04.064
OF THE AMOUNT OF CARMEL FINE IF

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.499
YOU REVENUE THAT'S COMING IN.

01:45:05.565 --> 01:45:06.800
AND IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED

01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:08.068
TO CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFY

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:11.071
SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH I AM UP

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:11.705
SOLVENCY.

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:14.141
THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS --

01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:15.375
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:17.277
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO REPORT ON

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:18.478
THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RECEIVING

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:19.579
I AM UP SUPPORT.

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:21.181
BY DECEMBER FIRST HAND SO THAT

01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:22.683
GIVE THEM SOME TIME TO KIND OF

01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:24.384
JUSTIFY THE PROGRAMS AND HELP

01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:25.886
THE LEGISLATURE EVALUATE THEM

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:27.521
AND DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:28.855
FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE.

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:30.724
OUR THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS THAT

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:31.858
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:32.726
OFTEN GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.661
TIME SO IN THE MEANTIME FOR THE

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:36.396
BUDGET YEAR WE WOULD RECOMMEND

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:37.030
PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING SO

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:38.932
THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD WHILE THE

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:40.467
ASSESSMENTS TAKING PLACE.

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:41.535
AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THESE

01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:42.703
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CUT

01:45:42.769 --> 01:45:44.471
CONSISTENT WITH OUR BROADER

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:45.806
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:47.140
IMPROVING THE STATE'S COME OFF I

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:47.774
ENVY SYSTEM [inaudible]

01:45:47.841 --> 01:45:50.844
OKAY.

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:51.411
ANY COMMENTS A QUESTION FOR

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:52.345
MEMBERS.

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:53.814
OF THE SYSTEM THAT I WOULD JUST

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.115
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT LAST

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:56.983
POINT AND WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:59.186
MENTIONING THE PROBLEMS WITH THE

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:00.520
FINES AND THE SYSTEM.

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:02.022
IN HER STATE OF THE JUDICIARY

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:03.490
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:04.791
EVERY PLACE THAT IS FUNDED BY

01:46:04.858 --> 01:46:06.493
THOSE FINES AND FEES.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.028
WE NEED TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:10.197
IS IF WE'RE GOING.

01:46:10.263 --> 01:46:11.498
TO APPROPRIATELY REMOVE THE

01:46:11.565 --> 01:46:12.999
JUDICIAL BRANCHES RELIANCE ON

01:46:13.066 --> 01:46:14.701
FINES AND FEES WE WE HAVE TO

01:46:14.768 --> 01:46:16.069
HAVE A VERY CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.237
IT IS WERE FUNDING AND WHY WHAT

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:18.839
ALL THOSE PROGRAMS ARE.

01:46:18.905 --> 01:46:21.775
AND THEN STOP THIS RELIANCE ON A

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:24.211
SYSTEM THAT'S BECOME REALLY

01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:25.946
UNFAIR AND UNFAIR TO TO THE

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:27.414
PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THE JUSTICE

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:29.382
SYSTEM TO TO BE FAIR.

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:30.917
SO THAT I THINK THAT POINT IS

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:32.719
WELL TAKEN THAT WE SHOULD LOOK

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:34.688
AT PROGRAMS WHAT THEIR EXPENSES

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:37.724
ARE AND NOT NECESSARILY RELY ON

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:40.026
THAT OLD STRUCTURE FROM.

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:41.695
ANY OF THE COMMENTS.

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:42.496
ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE I

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:44.998
THINK -- A WE AGREE WITH THAT

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:47.768
THAT OF THE I AM A FUN CONTINUES

01:46:47.834 --> 01:46:49.469
EVERY YEAR TO HAVE SOME ISSUES

01:46:49.536 --> 01:46:51.571
AND ANYTHING THAT'S FUNDED NOW

01:46:51.638 --> 01:46:52.839
BY FINES AND FEES SINCE WE

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.641
DECIDED THAT QUITE OFTEN THOSE

01:46:54.708 --> 01:46:56.743
FINES AND FEES OR UNFAIR AND SO

01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:56.943
WITH.

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:59.579
HAVING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD

01:46:59.646 --> 01:47:01.648
TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE SYSTEM --

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:03.650
AND THIS IS A REAL REFLECTION OF

01:47:03.717 --> 01:47:05.051
THAT THAT AT SOME POINT WOULD

01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:06.887
HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISION I

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:07.487
DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:08.321
ANY BETTER.

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:09.856
ESPECIALLY SINCE EVERYONE IS

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:11.758
DECIDED THAT THE SYSTEM OF FINES

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:14.127
AND FEES IS OFTEN UNFAIR AND

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:15.762
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS.

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:16.830
TO HELP PEOPLE HAVE THEIR DAY IN

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:18.899
COURT AND JUSTICE WITHOUT HAVING

01:47:18.965 --> 01:47:19.866
TO HAVE SUCH FINES AND FEES ALL

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:20.367
THE TIME.

01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:21.802
UP SAYS HE THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:23.069
TO PAY.

01:47:23.136 --> 01:47:24.504
FOR SO AS A RESULT IT PUTS THE

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.506
ALL THOSE COOL SOURCES.

01:47:26.573 --> 01:47:28.809
INTO OF JEOPARDY AND I KNOW

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.143
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT.

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:32.445
TO THE EXTENT THAT PROBABLY AD

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:34.147
NAUSEUM WE REMEMBER THOUGH WHO

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.649
GETS A PENNY WHO GETS THREE

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:37.017
PENNIES ARGUES FOR PENNIES FROM

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:39.486
IS JUST A A SYSTEM ITSELF THAT

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:39.920
IS.

01:47:39.986 --> 01:47:40.854
IS JUST.

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:42.088
A IT IT PROBABLY TAKES MORE

01:47:42.155 --> 01:47:43.390
MONEY TO MAINTAIN ALL THOSE

01:47:43.456 --> 01:47:45.392
LITTLE NUMBERS AND IT DOES WHAT

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:46.893
WE GET OUT OF IT SO I KNOW THAT.

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:49.162
BUT CLEARLY -- THAT'S SOMETHING

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:51.364
WE WILL CONSIDER BECAUSE I THINK

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:52.566
IT'S IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT

01:47:52.632 --> 01:47:54.134
WHERE -- IT'S ASYSTEM THAT IS

01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:57.070
BROKEN AND IT'S NOT GONNA REPAIR

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:58.238
ITSELF THAT'S CLEAR.
