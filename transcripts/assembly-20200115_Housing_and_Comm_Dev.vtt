CONVENTION- QUITE EASILY

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:24.876
THERE'S ECONOMIC SUICIDE- IT IS

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:26.277
QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.913
TYPES OF HOMELESSNESS- IT HAS

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.848
DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS. AND

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:33.017
THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CHILD

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:35.186
HOMELESSNESS A VERY DIFFERENT.

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.487
THAN OTHER TYPES OF

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:37.855
HOMELESSNESS- SOME OF THE

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:40.792
FACTS- THERE SHE DIDN'T

PAPERS. IS 87% OF HOMELESS

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:51.436

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:52.870
THESE KIDS CAN GET A JOB AT

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:56.307

CHRONIC HOMES. AND THEIR

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.020
CONCLUSION WAS THAT WE WILL

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:36.641
SECURE SHELTER GOING TO BRIDGE

00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:37.175
HOUSING GOING TO APARTMENT

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:40.044
HOUSE. WELL THEY HAD PEOPLE

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:41.112
COMING FROM IDAHO WASHINGTON IN

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.247
THE COAST. AND THEY RAN OUT OF

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:45.183

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:47.251
GOVERNOR GAME OF COUPLE MORE

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:47.885
MILLION DOLLARS NAY AROUND OUT

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.554
OF THAT. AND THEY- AT THE STATE

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.456
OF MASSACHUSETTS. HAS DONE THIS

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:55.226
TWELVE YEARS AGO. AND THEY HAVE

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:57.595
A LOT OF PROBLEMS AT FIRST BUT

00:34:57.662 --> 00:34:59.297
WE CAN WE KNOW WHAT THEY DID AS

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:01.466
SOLUTIONS THE USED EVERY MOTEL

00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:02.900
EVERY BED AND BREAKFAST IN THE

00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:04.769
WHOLE STATE AND THEY STILL

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:06.504
COULDN'T FIND PLACES TO PUT

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.005
THESE FAMILIES RIGHT NOW I

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:10.041
THINK THEY LOOK THEY RENT LESS

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:13.077
THAN- WAY LESS THAN A HUNDRED

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:13.611
MOTEL ROOMS. FOR THE WHOLE

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.813
STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.281
THAT'S ACTUALLY COMING OUT THE

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:19.550
WIDE IN THE RIVER RESTRICTIONS

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:22.887
ON WHAT FAMILIES APPLY SO.

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:26.057
AGAIN I THINK THAT OF. IT IS

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:27.225
MORALLY BANKRUPT BUT MORE

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.560
IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE NO NO ONE.

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:32.063
NO ONE SHOULD LEVEL MYSTERY.

00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:33.130
WHICH CHILDREN HAVE A LONG TERM

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:35.233
AFFECTED LIVE A LONG TIME. THE

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.468
SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS. AND THE

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:39.170
TRAUMA THEY GO THROUGH WILL

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:41.172
LAST THE REST OF THEIR LIVES

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:42.206
THEY WILL NOT WORK. THERE WAS

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:44.075
SPENDING A LOT AND WHEN THEY

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:45.443
GET TO FOSTER CARE THAT'S A

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.545
PIPELINE. THE GOES IMMEDIATELY

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:50.348
TO PRISON GANGS DEATH. SO WE

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:52.783
LOSE ALL OF IT THAT'S OUR OUR

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.151
PRODUCT THAT'S ALL WE HAVE IS

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.588
PERCENT OF THOSE THOSE BABIES

00:35:57.655 --> 00:36:00.725
BASICALLY. SO THE ONLY THING

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:03.895
ELSE- I WOULD. SUBMIT ALREADY

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.363

MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS-

OPTICALLY DURING THE RECESS I

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:14.258
THINK WE'VE BOTH LEARNED- EVEN

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:15.660
MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD ALREADY

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.795
KNOWN ABOUT HOMELESSNESS- IN

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:21.565
THIS PAST- COUPLE OF MONTHS-

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:22.633
AND ONE THING I'LL SAY THE

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.734
OUTSET BECAUSE I'VE ANSWER THIS

LET'S BECLEAR ABOUT THAT I

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.979
THINK THE WAY THAT THAT IS

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:37.348
UNDERSTOOD OPTICALLY FROM THE

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:40.317
NEW YORK EXPERIENCE I AS WE SAY

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:44.088
IN OUR STATE ANALYSIS IS- HAS

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.623
HAD DECIDED WITH MIXED RESULTS

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.658
IT FROM MY ACTIVE IT IS NOT.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:48.993
THE ANSWER TO THE CRISIS

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.363
BECAUSE IT WOULD REALLY FOCUSED

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:57.301
SO MANY OF ALL OF OUR RESOURCES

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:57.935
TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.337

00:39:03.574 --> 00:39:04.508
AND I THINK WE NEED TO. THINK

00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:05.676
OF A REALLY BALLOTS APPROACH AS

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:06.977

USED AS SUBSIDIES FOR RENT AND

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.593
HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.796
GET FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND A

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:08.799
WELL BEFORE THEY MIGHT BE. A

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:12.436

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:44.635
CLOSE TO GEN SOMETIMES EVEN

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.770
WITHIN THE MONTH WHICH MAKES IT

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:49.740
VERY DIFFICULT TO THIS OF THESE

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.342
FAMILIES SO- PART OF MOVING

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:53.177

THE HOUSING ADVOCATES SAY THAT

THAT IS ACTUALLY BEEN ONE OF

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.577
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PORTIONS OF

TRAINING INTO JOBS SO THAT HAS

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:45.262
BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:45.763
AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.731
ACTUALLY PORTIONS OF THEIR

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:48.799
PROGRAM. ONE JUST COMMENT WITH

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:51.635
THAT FULLER DID IS ONE OF THE

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:53.804
VERY FEW CITIES IN THE STATE OF

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:55.973
CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE ADOPTED AT

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.442
THE LOCAL LEVEL- OVERNIGHT

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.544
PARKING PROGRAM WE TRIED LAST

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:06.216
YEAR. AND THAT WAS NOT AN EASY

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:07.651
LIFTED BUT NOW THAT THEY-

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.153
STARTED IT'S BEEN ABOUT THREE

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:14.625
MONTHS. AND THEY ARE NOT HAVING

THIRTY FORTY CAR. THE NIGHT

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:17.428
BECAUSE THERE'S GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.829
WHO CAN PARK THERE BUT THE

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:20.965
FAITH BASED COMMUNITY. IT HAS

00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:23.901
REALLY STEPPED UP TO ASSIST

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.436
THESE FAMILIES WITH VERY

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:28.038
SPECIFIC WHETHER IT BE- A

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:34.078
COLLABORATION THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:36.647
ONCE WE CAN IDENTIFY THE VERY

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:39.016
SPECIFIC. TYPE OF NEED THAT

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:41.285
THESE FAMILIES NEED TO EITHER.

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.620

I CAN'T THINK OF ANY ISSUE

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:57.634
LARGER THAN THIS- FOR THE STATE

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:58.602
CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY A FROM A

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.571
CRISIS PERSPECTIVE AND TO

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.338

ADDRESS THE SECURITY OF THIS

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.009
CRISIS I APPRECIATE IT I WANT

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.176
TO ASK I THINK PERHAPS THE

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:07.444
OBVIOUS QUESTION I THINK IT WAS

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:08.412
LOU TO A BRIEFING YOUR

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.180
TESTIMONY OF THE NARROW NARROW

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:12.649
CASTING ON TO OPEN IN IN

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:15.886
CHILDREN- I DEFINITELY

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:16.453
SUBSCRIBE TO WOMEN CHILDREN

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.891
FIRST- FOR MANY. MANY THINGS

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:21.492
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE SIZE AND

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:23.660
SCALE OF THE- PROBLEM. IT SEEMS

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:24.661
AS THOUGH WORSE. THIS IS

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:25.863
LEGISLATION FOCUSES ON. A SMALL

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:26.463
COMPONENT OF OUR HOMELESSNESS

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.499
CRISIS- CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:31.035
NARROW CASTING OF THIS AND WHY

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:31.535
IT ISN'T A PERHAPS MORE

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.337
AMBITIOUS AND IT'S AN I

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.806
AMBITIOUS IS. WORDS SO THERE'S

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:36.807
NOTHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:38.308
HAPPIER THAN TO HAVE THE

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:39.176
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND IT A

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:40.711
THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE HOPING

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:42.679
THAT. WHEN I STARTED MY POVERTY

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:43.847
WORK I STARTED UNDER WITH

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:46.150
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND I WAS

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:47.584
FORTUNATE AS WE MOVE FOR

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:48.585
WITHOUT THAT THEY GOT EXPANDED

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.854
TO EVERYONE. THAT THE TASK

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:51.889
FORCE REPORT ACTUALLY ENDED UP

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:55.092
INCLUDING EVERYONE- MY HOPE IS

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:57.161
HONESTLY IS THAT THIS IS AN

00:44:57.227 --> 00:44:58.362
AMBITIOUS AND ITS AMBITIOUS

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.998
WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND-

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:02.466
MY HOPE IS THAT IT'S- POINT

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.768
ALONG THE LINE. UP OF MOMENTUM

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:09.573
AND- PORT. BUT WE CAN'T EXPAND.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.140
MY HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY I DO

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.642
BELIEVE EVERY SINGLE I THINK.

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.710
CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO THAT EVERY

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:16.013
SINGLE PERSON IN OUR COMMUNITY

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.148
WHICH IS NOT HOMELESS AND HAS A

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:20.818
ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND SO I A

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:23.520
100% I AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS

00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:26.290
AND I WITH EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:26.990
CONCERNED WE ACTUALLY HAD

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.859
SPECIFIC COMP SHINS ABOUT.

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:30.994
CARDS AND SOME PER FAMILY THAT

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:31.562
HAVE YOU HAD THIS EXPERIENCE

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:34.198
AND SO IT IS MY ASPIRATION AND

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:35.866
MY AMBITION TO EVENTUALLY GET

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:39.203
THERE- BUT THIS HAS BEEN A

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.238
TRAGIC TO GET CHILDREN AND

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:42.906
FAMILIES JUST TO THIS LEVEL. SO

00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:46.477
ANA. WE'VE GOT GOOD GRACES WE

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:47.010
END UP WITH EVERYBODY. I'M

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.046
UNDER THE MANDATE BUT FOR NOW

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:51.148
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO JUST WITH

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:52.616
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN IN I

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:54.251
UNDERSTAND THAT AND I HAVE

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:55.953
LAUNCHED BRIBE. IDEA THAT A

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.888
PROBLEM OF THIS OP ED THIS

00:45:57.955 --> 00:45:59.490
COMPLEXITY- MIGHT BE ATTACKED

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:02.092
TACKLED IN DIGESTIBLE PIECES IF

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:04.027
YOU WILL FOCUS ON VETERANS

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.896
FOCUS ON. FOCUS ON DOMESTIC

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:06.897
VIOLENCE VICTIMS TRANSITION AGE

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:08.932
IF YOU- BUT AS A STATED GOAL OF

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:09.900
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.302
PERSONALLY COMFORTABLE WITH

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:15.339
SIGN UP FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:16.773
EVERYBODY OFF THE STREETS. AND

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.177
WE MAY NOT HIT THAT GOAL. BUT I

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.846
DID BUT WHO DECIDES THAT GOAL

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:27.084
I'M IN. THE WHAT. EXCEPT THE-

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:27.618
SHELTER PEOPLE THE STATUS

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:28.919
BECAUSE FOR THEM THE NOT. ZERO

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:29.520
AND THAT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS.

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:30.454
THAT IS A CHALLENGE I HAVE HERE

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:31.255
BUT AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THE NEED

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.223
TO DO DIGESTIBLE PIECES IN A

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.690
GENERAL COMMITMENT TO

00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:34.224
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRUE

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:36.260
OBJECTIVE IS- I THINK THE

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:37.594
CONCERN THAT ALL OF US SHOULD

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:38.228
HAVE THESE MANY OF OUR BECAUSE

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:40.063
YOU. WONDER DO WE GET WHAT'S

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.365
GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES. DO

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:43.066
I SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY I

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:44.134
HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:47.337
CARD FOR MY HOME- I UNDERSTAND

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:50.674
HOW BIG THIS PROBLEM IS. I

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:53.377
WOULD JUST BE CONCERNED THAT

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:55.979
THE NARROW SCOPE THIS MAY

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:56.580
SUGGEST TO THEM THAT WE DON'T.

00:46:56.647 --> 00:47:00.851
SPEAK SEVERELY. IN ADULT MALE.

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:01.952
IS THE MAIN. REASON FOR

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:02.953
COMPLAINTS. MAY RECEIVE. AND

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:03.587
THAT THIS BILL WOULDN'T ADDRESS

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.321
IT BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:05.122
SAYING I THINK THAT'S GOOD. THE

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:06.056
SECOND OBSERVATION I WANT TO

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:06.924
MAKE IS IN TERMS OF

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.026
ENFORCEABILITY. I RECOGNIZE

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.260
THAT THE VERY DIFFICULT

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:13.030
SUBJECT. MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:14.298
THIS WOULD PROVIDE SOME

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.098
ADDITIONAL LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:16.934
IN SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.101
UNDERTAKE VERY DIFFICULT WORK

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.837
CREATING HOUSE. FOR FOLKS. EVEN

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:21.605
AS SYMPATHETIC AS WOMEN AND

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:25.108
CHILDREN. CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:28.412
WE CAN GET COMMUNITIES TO DO

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:30.314
THEIR FAIR SHARE BECAUSE LET

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.250
MISS QUIRK SILVA. MY COMMUNITY

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.819
IS UNDER. A NUMBER OF ISSUE HIS.

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:37.821
HOME I'M THIS IS THIS IS. THE

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:38.422
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE IN A

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:40.023
POSITION OF TRYING TO. ACTUALLY

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.491
TAKE THAT STEP I AGREE AND SO

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:42.125
THERE'S TWO THINGS ONE. TING

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:42.793
DATA AS TO THE PROGRESS SO THAT

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:44.328
WE ARE COLLECTING INFORMATION

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:45.462
BUT THE GOAL OF THIS IS

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.263
ACTUALLY TO CREATE

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.965
ACCOUNTABILITY. THE I A TASK

00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:49.733
FORCE OF THE COUNCIL IN THEIR

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.535
REPORTS SUGGESTED A PUBLIC

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:53.303
RIGHT OF ACTION WE HAVE BEEN

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.871
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AND

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.807
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.408
WITH OTHERS TO FIGURE WHAT THE

00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.444
APPROPRIATE TEETH SHOULD. BE

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.278
I'M IF A PUBLIC RIGHT ACTION IS

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:03.080
THE CORRECT. IS THAT CORRECT

00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:05.515
MECHANISM- AND WE ARE IN

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:06.950
PROCESS OF FIGURING WHAT THE

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:09.086
MECHANISM IS WITH HOW

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:11.655
SOMETHING. THERE HAS TO BE

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.023
ACCOUNTABILITY WE HAVE SPENT

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.159
AND IN THE LAST TWO DOLLARS ITS-

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:19.229
WAS AND- LESS. INTO DOLLARS.

00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:19.830
WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK

00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:21.398
WE ALL SEE THAT IT IS AN

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:23.333
ANALYST AT THIS AND I THINK THE

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.835
MANDATE FINALLY PUTS AN END TO

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:26.870
THAT IT SAYS. THIS MEANS IT'S

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.772
NOT VOLUNTARY THIS MONEY MUST

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.874
GO TO HOUSING NOT JUST PLANNING

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.410
ANYMORE BUT TO DOING IT. AND SO

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:35.112
I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:35.712
THERE'S TEETH IN HERE BUT WE

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:36.947
NEED STRONGER TEETH AND WHAT

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:38.949
THAT MECHANISM LOOKS LIKE WE

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:41.818
ARE IN PROCESS WITH EVERYBODY

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:42.419
AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:42.953
OUT THE BEST. ENFORCEMENT

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.889
MECHANISM BESIDES. MANDATE AND

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.891
SAYING IT'S NO LONGER VOLUNTARY

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:49.359
TO PLACE TO DO THESE PROJECTS

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.560
WHAT I WOULD LOOK FOR THAT

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:52.529
CONTINUED CONVERSATION GOING

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.498
FOR NOW AND BY THE WAY WERE

00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:55.599
OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS WE'RE

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.501

THE ENFORCEMENT AND WE WANT AS

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.070
MANY PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THAT

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:02.739
CONVERSATION AS POSSIBLE I

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:04.241
WOULD SAY THAT FOR THOSE WHO

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.443
FEET AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM-

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.811
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:10.614
EVERYTHING WE CAN AS FAR ENOUGH

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:12.416
TO FEAR AND- I THINK

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:13.984
PARTICULARLY. FOR MAKING HONEST.

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:18.789
ANY. BE ALMOST PEOPLE IS THAT

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:19.389
THERE IS A WAY TO SWIFTLY GET

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:19.990
THEM OFF THE STREETS AND MAKE

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:20.757
THEIR- UNFILTERED EXPERIENCE

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.993
BRIEF- AND HOPEFULLY ONE TIME-

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.697

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:31.421
YOU'VE TAKEN THE- OF THE

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.356
AMENDMENTS THAT THE STAFF

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:35.892

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.861
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LÏNG SHIA-

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.830

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:41.631
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:42.833
LANGUAGE I DID HAVE SOME

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.468
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL BEFORE

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:46.069
THE AMENDMENTS AND I HAVE ONE

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:47.671
LINGERING CONCERN THAT-

APPLE GET DRESSED AND THAT IS-

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:56.780
I THINK THE- THAT. SINGLING OUT

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:58.548
OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AS

00:51:58.615 --> 00:51:59.182
IMPORTANT AS THOSE COURTS OURS

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:01.818
DOESN'T JEWEL'S ARE- IS THE

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:03.019
WRONG APPROACH THIS IS

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:05.655
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD SET OUT

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:06.289
OF STANDARDS THAT APPLY ACROSS

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:08.792
THE BOARD TO. EVERYONE SO

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:12.596
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- I AND MY

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:15.599

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:21.505
BILL APPROPRIATIONS AND ON AND

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.072
THE FULL THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:22.672
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO HAVE

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:25.942
THAT CONVERSATION. AND UGH UGH

00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:27.310
I ALSO WANT TO THANK A MIS

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:30.113
QUIRK SILVA FOR RAISING THE

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.482
ISSUE THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:37.621
OF. HOW WE CAN GO ABOUT MAKING

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:38.822
SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T BECOME

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.757
HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE- WE

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:42.959
HAVE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.461
MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST AT

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:47.330
RISK FOR BECOMING HOMELESS. WE

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:49.533
KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE FALLING

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.701
CUT INTO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.703
OF FALLING OUT OF THEIR HOUSING

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.772
BECAUSE IT'S BECOMING MORE AND

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:59.543
MORE ON AFFORDABLE. WE HAVE TO

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:02.913
PLACE MORE EFFORT ON THE

WELL FUNDED AS THEY ARE TODAY.

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:16.927
SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY WILL

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:18.929
NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND THE

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:21.932

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:24.434
UNITS ONLINE DOES NOT ALLOW US

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:26.236
THE LUXURY OF WAITING TO

ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THOSE WHO

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:32.909
ARE AFFECTED NOW. A. I THINK WE

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.277
NEED TO HAVE A BROADER APPROACH

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.947

HOMELESS BUT THEY'RE SHELTERED

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:11.147
20% OR NOT AND WE NEED TO

FOCUS. ATTENTION ON THE TWENTY.

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:15.285

TELLING OUR OUTREACH WORKERS ON

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.743

HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND HOUSING

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:06.569
THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND WE HAVE

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.238

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.267
WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.737
COMMUNITIES- NOT ONLY TO HAVE A

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.205

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.797
HUNDRED OTHER CITIES DON'T LOOK

REGION TO REGION- AND EVERYONE

TRIPLEX QUAD LEX'S CAN HAVE A

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:07.730
SIGNIFICANT AND BY. AND THIS

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:08.364
REALLY I THINK REPRESENTS KIND

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:09.332
OF A RETURN THIS MISSING MIDDLE

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:09.899
HOUSING THAT USED TO BE SO

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:13.769
POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA- FORTY

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:16.172
FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO WE

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:16.739
HAVEN'T BUILT ENOUGH OF THAT

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.441
HOUSING RECENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.743
LOS ANGELES. PERCENT OF THE

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.478
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WERE

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:23.813
REZONED A WHOLE JUST TO HOMES

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.715
DUPLEXES. THE LOCAL HOUSING

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.583
STOCK WOULD INCREASE BY SEVEN

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:28.918
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:30.186
THOUSAND MORE UNITS. IN SAN

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:31.654

SINGLE FAMILY HOMES A COMPANY

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.325
TO UNITS. THERE IS HOUSING

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.260
STOCK COULD GROW TO ALMOST 19%

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:41.597
IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. AB

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:42.231
SEVEN TWENTY FIVE ENSURES THAT

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:43.733

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.240
IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE CAN

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:52.808

DENSITY HOUSING THAT THIS BILL

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.875

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:24.894
CONFIGURATIONS FOR HIGH FIRES

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.895
ON IN SOME OF THESE

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:28.831
METROPOLITAN DESIGNATED AREAS-

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.799
AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:34.336
YEAH I'M CURRENTLY- THE BILLS

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.005
THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:37.439
THAT QUALIFY FOR IT I THINK

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.008
YOU'VE UNDER IF YOU SEE THOSE

01:09:39.074 --> 01:09:39.942
SEVEN OF THAT SO MANY AND IT

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:49.618
SON QUESTION TWO I KNOW I HAVE

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:50.419
SOME CITIES THAT ARE OVER A

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:52.588
HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT ARE NOT

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.423
LISTED THERE AND SO. I THINK

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.457
THE METROPOLITAN DESIGNATION I

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.560
THINK IS. FLUID IT'S NOT STATIC

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.395
RIGHT. YEAH AND I THINK THE

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:02.431
GOAL IS TO. BUILD MORE HOMES.

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.533
MORE DENSELY IN AND MORE DENSE

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.569
COMMUNITIES RIGHT. WHICH TEND

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:07.570
NOT TO BE IN THE FIRE ZONE

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:09.805
ERICA'S. BUT THERE'S SOME SHINS

CONVERSATIONS FOR SOME TIME IT

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:21.483

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.918
GUARDIANS THE- ISSUES GOING

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:25.821

WHERE. THE CITY WILL HAVE A

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:43.272
CERTAIN. PARTS OF THE

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.506
COMMUNITY. JUST LOOK VERY

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.874
DIFFERENT- YOU KNOW. THERE'S

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.443
LIKE THE DOWNTOWN THAT LOOKS

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.545
DIFFERENT THAN YOU KNOW ANOTHER

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:53.549
NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IN PARTICULAR

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.484
