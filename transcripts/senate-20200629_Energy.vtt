ELSE HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:58.510

THIS IS THE- AS A PUBLIC

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:10.922
BENEFIT NONPROFIT CORPORATION

00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:13.291
BECAUSE OF THAT STATUS IT TOO

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:13.925
WILL BE PAYING NO STATE INCOME

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:16.061
TAX. SECONDLY IT WILL NOT BE

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:18.597
PAYING- AND THE- RATE OF RETURN

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:19.865
ON THOSE INVESTMENTS SO THERE'S

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:22.067
NO SHAREHOLDER PAYMENTS OR

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.802

TO A BILLION AND A HALF TO TWO

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:28.640
BILLION DOLLARS OF WHEN THEY

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:29.775
WERE A GOOD COMPANY WHEN THEY

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:32.444
BECOME ONE AGAIN- SO THERE'S A

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:33.979
COUPLE OF BILLION DOLLARS THERE

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:35.147
AS WELL AS A SAVINGS IN. IN

TAX TO THE STATE THAT WOULD BE.

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:42.354
NOT SPENT AND SAVED SO IF YOU

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:42.988
LOOK AT THAT OVER A PERIOD OF

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:46.424
TIME. THAT MONEY YOU DOES LEAVE

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.260
THE RATE PAYERS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:50.395
THAT LIABILITY WITH INSURANCE

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:52.297
WITH THE WILDFIRE FUNDS THAT WE

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:53.398
ESTABLISH LAST YEAR THAT WILL

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:55.734
PROTECT. THE UTILITY FROM A

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:56.968
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THAT THAT

00:23:57.035 --> 00:24:00.939
LIABILITY- BUT JUST AS IN THIS

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:04.142
LEGISLATION A PENALTY THAT WILL

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:06.845
IF. THE UTILITY FAILS IN SOME

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:08.980
REGARD AS GOLDEN STATE ENERGY

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:13.084
AND- A PENALTY IS ASSESSED

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.319
AGAINST THEM. WHERE IS IN A-

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:15.120
INVESTOR OWNED YOU THAT PENALTY

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:17.355
WOULD GO TO SHAREHOLDERS BY LAW

00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:18.890
HERE IT WOULD GO TO THE RATE

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:21.693
PAYERS BUT- MY ASSUMPTION MY

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.862
FEELING AND WHY I SUPPORT THIS.

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.964
IS THAT THE SAVINGS OVER TIME.

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:27.199
BECAUSE OF THE RATE OF RETURN

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:28.466
IN THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:30.235
THIS NECESSARY GOING FORWARD IN

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.938
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS- TO HARDEN

00:24:33.004 --> 00:24:34.673
AGREED IN TO MAKE IT WORK. IS

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:36.775
SUBSTANTIAL AND THAT SAVINGS

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:39.010
WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL FOR GOLDEN

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.645
STATE ENERGY SO THAT I BELIEVE

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:42.013
THE COST WOULD ACTUALLY BE A

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.181
SAVINGS TO THE RATE PAYERS IN

00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:45.317
THE FUTURE. RATHER THAN A

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:48.386

SHAREHOLDER OWNS PRIVATE

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:10.135

AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT PUBLICLY

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:16.875
OWNED UTILITIES- THAT HAVE BEEN

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:19.277
VERY SUCCESSFUL INCLUDING RIGHT

PIGEON IS A PLENTY OF CHANCES A

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:06.758

HAD. NO ELECTRICITY OUT THERE

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.112
THEY ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZED

00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:08.813
AMERICA DID. WHAT THEY CALL

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.548
RULE ELECTRICS WE WERE ABLE TO

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.517
BOND OURSELVES. AND BRING

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.252
TRANSMISSION LINES CLEAR OUT

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:14.786
WHERE THERE WAS VERY FEW

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:17.956
PEOPLE. AND PUT IN A SYSTEM

THAT IS. ACTUALLY OWNED AND

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:22.193
OPERATED BY THE PEOPLE WE HAVE

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.661
AN ELECTED BOARD THEY RUN FOR

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:25.163

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:59.931
INTENTIONALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:02.033
THIS IS NOT A STATE OPERATED

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:03.267

ARRIVE AT ANY KIND OF DEAL- IN

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.362
THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IF ANY

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:12.430
KIND OF SETTLEMENT WAS GOING TO

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:13.531
BE APPROVED AT ALL AND IF

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:14.832
ANYONE'S GONNA BE COMING TO THE

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.101
TABLE- WE KNOW THE THAT THE

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:17.868
PICTURE LOOKS A LITTLE

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:20.004
DIFFERENT NOW BUT- I STILL

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.373
THINK THIS BILL IS NECESSARY.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.041
BUT I WANTED TO JUST. MAKE ONE

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:26.410
COMMENT AND ASK YOU A QUESTION

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.645
JUST FOR CLARITY THE RECORD

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:32.316
PURPOSES. I YOU KNOW THAT THERE

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:33.751
SEEMS TO BE SOME IMPLICATION

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:36.387
THAT THIS MEASURE. IS GOING TO

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:39.123
CONSTITUTE A DEBT FOR A

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.958
LIABILITY HANGING OVER THE HEAD

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.960
OF NOT JUST NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:45.062
RATEPAYERS OR TAXPAYERS BUT ALL

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:47.331
OF THE STATE I'M A SOUTHERN

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:47.898
CALIFORNIA REPAIRMAN EDISON

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:53.104
CUSTOMER. AND YOU KNOW I READ

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.138
THE MEASURE ACTUALLY IS

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.807
EXPLICITLY BARRING SUCH A

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:59.343
LIABILITY FROM BEING INCURRED

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.778
BY THE PASSAGES LET

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:04.548
LEGISLATION. AND IN FACT IT.

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:06.684
NOT ONLY YOU KNOW OR THAT THE

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.352
SOME OF THE TAX PURPOSES THAT

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:11.956
YOU MENTIONED- BUT- IS IT IS IT

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.090
NOT THE CASE THAT THEIR

00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:16.127
EXPRESSLY BARRED- IN THE

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:17.995
FORMATION OF GSC FROM THAT

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.364
CONSTITUTING A DEBTOR LIABILITY

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:23.000
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.468
IS THE YEAR THE GOAL AND THAT

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.636
IS THE INTENT OF THE

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:29.707
LEGISLATION- THE- THE GOAL HAS

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:33.177
BEEN IN THE LANGUAGE I THINK.

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:35.413
ARTICULATES THAT FACT THAT TOO

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.314
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:38.816
IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:40.051
COMPANY IN FACT IN THE

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.252
NEGOTIATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.720
THAT'S WHERE THIS CONVERSATION

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:44.822
REALLY OCCURRED- BECAUSE WE

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:46.991
WANTED TO. PICK THE GUARANTEE

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.492
NEEDED TO BE IN PLACE THAT THE

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:51.295
STRUCTURE THE GOVERNANCE AND

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:52.096
THE MAIN OPERATION OF THE

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.031
COMPANY WAS DONE IN A MANNER

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.399
THAT THERE WOULD NEVER BE AN

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:57.568
INTERPRETATION THAT THIS WAS AN

00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:59.437
INSTRUMENTALITY OF CALIFORNIA.

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:01.105
AND THEREFORE BE LAW THE RATE

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.406
PAYERS OR THE CITIZENS OF

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:03.741
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:04.809
AND LIABLE FOR THIS SO THAT

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.844
THAT WAS FROM THE BEGINNING THE

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.713
GOAL THE INTENT AND THAT'S THE

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.114
STRUCTURE IN THE FINANCING

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.415
STRUCTURES ARE PART OF THAT.

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:13.150
WELL I APPRECIATE THAT WORK AND

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:14.785
I THINK I THINK FROM A DRAFTING

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.454
PERSPECTIVE IT'S DONE BEEN DONE

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.855
PRETTY CLEARLY HERE I MEAN I

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:20.424
SEE BASICALLY. THOSE FOLLOWING

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:25.196
ALONG THE TEXAN PART. FOUR

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:25.796
THREE FOUR FOUR TWO. INDEED IT

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:26.464
IS SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.732
CONSTITUTE DEBTOR LIABILITY THE

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:29.033
STATE OR ANY POLITICAL

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.303
SUBDIVISION THERE OF THAT'S IN-SECTION SUBSECTION A AND THEN

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:35.005
SEE SAYS- THE ISSUANCE OF

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:36.540
INDEBTEDNESS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:38.342
INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENT LEE

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:39.944
OBLIGATE THE STATE. OR ANY

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.712
OTHER POLITICAL SUBDIVISION TO

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.114
LEVY A PLEDGE ANY FORM OF

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.216
TAXATION OR TO MAKE AN

00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:46.350
APPROPRIATION FOR THREE

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:48.252
PAYMENT. SO I THINK THE BILL IS

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:50.187
PRETTY PLAIN IN ITS WORDING SO.

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:51.489
FROM A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:54.024
PERSPECTIVE BUT- I DON'T SEE A

00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:57.461
FINANCIAL RISK AND IN FACT. I

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.497
SEE IT THIS IS A POSITIVE STEP

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.765
FOR TO GET A BIT OF AN EQUITY

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:02.366
STAKE. FROM A POLICY

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:04.869
PERSPECTIVE NOT SO MUCH FROM A

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.537
FINANCIAL OBLIGATION BUT FROM A

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:08.606
FROM ACTUALLY HOW WE WANT THESE

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:09.874
CALIFORNIA UTILITIES TO BE

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.408
GOVERNED I SEE IT AS A POSITIVE

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:13.811
THING TO HAVE A FEW. THREE

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.746
MEMBERS OF THAT BOARD- FROM

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:18.883
THIS BODY AND THE IMPLICATION

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.351
THAT SOMEHOW THIS DEAL HAS

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:25.055
BEEN- TAINTED OR OVER RUN BY.

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:27.424
SOME MAGICALLY POWERFUL SOLAR

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.627
LOBBY I THINK IS A- A FALSE

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:32.062
PREMISE TO BEGIN WITH- FIRST OF

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:33.497
ALL I WOULD LOVE IF THIS BILL

00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:35.733
WERE A LITTLE MORE FOCUSED ON.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.134
THE FUTURE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:38.369
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:40.304
REALLY GETTING. THIS GOLDEN

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.340
STATE ENERGY. CONCEPTS FOCUSED

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.942
ON- SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:46.177
INTEREST BE THREE FIFTY GOALS

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.711
ARE BUILDING D. CARBONIZATION

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:48.813
GOALS AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:49.914
SHOULD BE IN THE FOUNDING

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.317
CONSTITUTION OF. WHATEVER THIS

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:53.884
ENTITY IS SHOULD EMERGE BUT

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.986
SECONDLY. TO ASSUME THAT- WE'VE

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.688
WE'VE HEARD IT JUST REPEATEDLY

00:40:57.755 --> 00:40:58.722
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:00.791
THIS. POWER THE SOLAR LOBBY AND

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:03.794
I WOULD JUST. SUBMITTED YOU

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:04.295
STACK UP THE OIL AND GAS

00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:07.264
LOBBIES. COLLECTIVE FIRE POWER

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.266
IN THIS TOWN AND MANY ACROSS

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.168
THIS WHOLE COUNTRY AND I WOULD

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:15.206
SAY. THE SOLAR LOBBYIST DWARFED

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:17.408
IN COMPARISON SO TO THE I JUST

00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:18.642
HAVE TO MAKE THAT POINT OF

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:20.711
ORDER BECAUSE IT ACT YOU CAN'T

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:23.614
LET THAT THAT KIND OF POSTURE-

00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:27.418
BE UPHELD TOO LONG HERE. YEAH

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:29.019
WE RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TO

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:29.987
BENEFIT BECAUSE OF OUR

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:31.322
RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICIES IN

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:32.756
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.458
IMPLICATION OTHERWISE IS A

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.728
MISNOMER SO. LISTEN I ALSO I

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:38.596
THINK THE BILL COULD GO A

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.297
LITTLE FURTHER IN THAT SORT OF

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:44.902
DIRECTIONAL- PURPOSE TO REALLY

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:46.203
ALIGNED WITH OUR CLIMATE IN

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.738
RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS BUT I

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:49.006
APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE USING

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:50.808
THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. AS THE

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.343
ENTITY TO REALLY BE THE

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:54.912
BACKBONE OF THE BONDING- AND

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:56.513
THE FINANCING SIDE BECAUSE WE

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.282
JUST IN DOUBT THEM ALSO WITH

00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.650
NEW AUTHORITIES WHEN IT COMES

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:01.819
TO. FINANCING CLIMATE

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.120
MITIGATION SO I ACTUALLY THINK

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.355
THERE COULD BE SOME REAL

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:06.190
IMPORTANT SYNERGIES. FROM THAT

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:08.125
PERSPECTIVE TO DE RISK THIS

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.360
WHOLE SYSTEM FROM A CLIMATE

00:42:09.426 --> 00:42:11.896
FUTURE THAT IS HERE SO I WITH

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:12.529
THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:13.964
THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU SO

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:16.400
MUCH SENATOR STERN MEMBERS

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:17.234
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE MAJORITY

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.269
LEADER SENATOR HERTZBERG THEY

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:19.803
WERE INJURED OVER TO CENTER

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:23.474
BAD. SOME INJURED FOR SURE SIR.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.244
YEAH I JUST TO. TAKE A MOMENT

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.813
IN INCOME TO BUILD UPON. THE

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.515
POINT SINCE SENATOR STIRRED

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:35.486
RAISED. THE SITUATION WHERE

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:38.789
FRAZIER IT'S NOT SITTING DOWN

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:40.357
AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:43.427
DEVELOP PUBLIC POLICY FOR HOW

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.062
WE DEAL WITH INVESTOR OWNED

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:47.998
UTILITIES. OUR CIRCUMSTANCES

00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:49.433
INFORMED BY THE FEDERAL

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.501
GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:53.070
BANKRUPTCY COURT. JUDGE ONE

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:55.873
TALI WHAT HIS DECISION IS WHICH

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.108
BASICALLY IS PAY CREDITORS NOT

00:42:58.175 --> 00:42:58.842
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT RATE

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.010
PAYERS NOT WORRIED ABOUT

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:01.111
ANYTHING ELSE JUST MAKE SURE

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:03.347
CREDITORS ARE PAID THAT'S THE

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:05.549
ROLE OF BANKRUPTCY JUDGES. AND

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:07.651
LAST YEAR WHO SENATOR DODD AT

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.987
THE HELM. WE CAME UP WITH A

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:11.956
PRETTY ELEGANT SOLUTION AS IT

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.791
RELATES TO FIGURING OUT HOW

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.492
WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:17.594
BALANCE OF CHALLENGES. BETWEEN

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.963
CLIMATE CHANGE THAT IS

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:21.265
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:22.766
FRAMEWORK IN SO MANY WAYS.

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:25.436
MAKING SURE THE STATE TAXPAYERS

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.204
ARE NOT ON THE HOOK. AND SO NOW

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.239
THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:31.775
THAT SENATOR HILLS BILL I THINK

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:32.643
ADDRESSES IN A REALLY WHAT GOOD

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:38.582
WAY. IS HOW DO YOU CREATE IF A

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:39.083
AN AVOIDANCE OF A THIRD

00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:42.152
BANKRUPTCY. HOW DO YOU DO THAT.

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.287
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES

00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:45.089
SENATOR HILL HAVE DONE HERE IS

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.390
TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THE WAY

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.392
THAT GIVES US AN OPTION. WHERE

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.461
THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE BUT THE

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.496
RISK OF THAT ALTERNATIVE IN A

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:55.766
STATE THAT HAS ARMED. THE

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:58.102
INVERSE CONDEMNATION LAW. IS

00:43:58.168 --> 00:43:59.603
THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.071
BE A HUNDRED CENTS ON THE

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:02.106
DOLLAR ON THE HOOK FOR EVERY

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:04.775
SINGLE. TRAGEDY THE CURSE

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.110
RATHER THAN THE RATE PAYERS OR

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:08.412
THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THESE

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:11.849
COMPANIES. AND SO WHAT SENATOR

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:14.284
HILL DID HERE IN THIS BILL. WAS

00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:16.186
TO FIGURE OUT AND IT'S SO

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:17.488
IMPORTANT I KNOW THAT CENTER

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:18.889
STERN ADDRESS IT BUT I WANT TO

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:20.924
ACCENTUATE THE POINT. OF HOW DO

00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:22.726
YOU CREATE THAT INTERREGNUM

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:24.361
THAT PERIOD WHERE YOU HAVE SOME

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:25.396
OTHER ENTITY THAT COULD TAKE

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:27.664
THE AUTHORITY AWAY. FROM THE

00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:28.665
EXISTING INVESTOR OWNED

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:30.501
UTILITY. WITHOUT IMPOSING

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:32.569
LIABILITY ON THE ON THE STATE

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:34.538
OF CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS THAT'S

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.540
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL.

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:37.141
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:39.309
DO IN VIEW OF. THE ROLE OF THE

00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:41.078
BANKRUPTCY COURT. THE ROLE OF

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.313
SENATOR DODD'S BILL. AND THEN

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.282
FIGURING OUT YOU HOW YOU HAVE

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:46.383
AN APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE IT IS

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.585
NOT. BY SITTING DOWN AND READ

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:52.222
DRAFTING HOW WE'RE GONNA DO. A

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:53.590
UTILITIES IN THE STATE OF

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:56.226
CALIFORNIA I'M TOTALLY AGAINST

00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:57.528
UNTIL E FIX INVERSE

00:44:57.594 --> 00:44:59.196
CONDEMNATION ANY PUBLIC

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:01.265
OWNERSHIP. OVER WHAT WE HAVE A

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:03.067
UTILITIES BECAUSE IT'S JUST

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:04.601
GOING TO RESULT IN HUGE

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.570
LIABILITY TO TAXPAYERS. ON TOP

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:07.704
OF ALL THE ECONOMIC

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.006
CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE ALL THE

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.808
SERVICES WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE.

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.176
HOUSING AND ALL THE OTHER KINDS

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:13.911
OF THINGS WE GOTTA DO AND NOW

00:45:13.977 --> 00:45:15.145
WE'RE GOING TO SUFFER THIS RISK

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:17.548
IT MAKES NO SENSE SO I. I JUST

00:45:17.614 --> 00:45:18.816
WANTED TO PUT THAT STATEMENT ON

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:21.552
THE RECORD. I THINK THAT- THE

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:22.953
ARCHITECTURE WHAT WE HAVE

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.422

FRAMEWORK IS SENATOR DODD. AND

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.427
I THINK SENATOR HILL IS DONE A

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:32.396
GREAT JOB. IN THIS REGARD NONE

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:33.697
OF THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BUT IF

DEBATE WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.427
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:04.661
I STAND HERE PROBLEM IN A VERY

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:07.097
UNIQUE POSITION- AND PRIVATE

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.899
THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:10.701
COMMITTEE. THAT HAS WORKED IN

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.803
THE TELEPHONY INDUSTRY AS WELL

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.874
AS INVESTOR OWNED. UTILITY AND

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.975
OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE'VE

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:20.878
HEARD A VARIETY OF IDEAS AND

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:22.746
SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE IMPROVE

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:24.648
TELEPHONY. IN THIS STATE AND

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:26.316
THIS COUNTRY HIGH WE IMPROVE

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:29.219
THE DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY.

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:31.054
AND MANY TIMES THOSE

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:33.757
INDIVIDUALS ARE CLUELESS AS TO

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:36.059
WHAT IS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:38.629
THE DELIVERY. OF THOSE

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.330
RESOURCES IN THOSE PRODUCTS. A

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:43.567
WISE MAN ONCE STATED. IF

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:45.002
ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL CAME BACK

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:47.638
TODAY. HE WOULD NOT ONLY

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.439
RECOGNIZE COULD NOT RECOGNIZE

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.908
THE TELEPHONE HE WOULD NOT A

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:54.211
USER HI. BUT IF THOMAS EDISON

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:55.712
CAME BACK TODAY HE WOULD

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:58.048
CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE ELECTRICAL

00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:00.050
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:02.719
HERE TODAY WHETHER IT'S- HYDRO

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:04.421
WHETHER IT'S GAS WHETHER IT'S

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:07.024
RENEWABLE. BECAUSE IT HAS IT

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.860
EVOLVED THAT MUCH OVER THE LAST

00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:11.094
HUNDRED YEARS THAT YOU CAN MAKE

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.096
RADICAL CHANGES BUT THOSE

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.464
RADICAL CHANGES THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:17.100
IN INTERNET TELEPHONY INDUSTRY

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.169
WAS NOT DRIVEN BY LEGISLATURE.

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:21.205
OUR LEGISLATION IT WAS DRIVEN

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:24.174
BY CONSUMERS. AND FAR TOO OFTEN

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.510
WE FIND OURSELVES TRYING TO

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:29.680
LEGISLATE A INDUSTRY THAT MANY

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:31.181
OF US HAVE VERY LITTLE IDEAL. A

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:34.218
HOLLYWOOD OPERATE. I WILL STAND

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:36.887
HERE NOT DEFEND. THE UTILITIES

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.722
BUT TO STATE THAT THE BEDROCK

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:41.458
OF WHO THEY ARE. THERE

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:44.361
FOUNDATION. IS CUSTOMER AND

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:47.431
EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.233
THOSE ARE THE THREE PRONGS OF

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:50.634
EVERY INVESTOR OWNED A

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.637
MUNICIPALLY OWNED. UTILITY THAT

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:55.205
I'VE EVER INTERFACE WITH.

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.740
CUSTOMER RELIABILITY WORK

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:59.876
RELIABILITY I MEAN SAFETY AND

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:02.512
RELIABLE SERVICES. BUT MANY

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:04.982
TIMES WE PER POLLS CHANGES TO

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:08.085
INDUSTRY. AND WE DON'T FACTOR

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.487
IN THE COST. GIRLS ARE WHAT WE

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.155
SAY THERE WILL BE BILLIONS OF

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:14.424
DOLLARS OF IMPACT IF THIS IS

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:16.360
TURNED OVER TO A NONPROFIT AND

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:18.295
AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHO PAYS

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:20.230
FOR. MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.132
UP BOTTLES BUT HERE TO SAY

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.568
THAT'S NOT THIS AUTHOR HERE.

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.469
BECAUSE I HAD A OPPORTUNITY TO

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:27.070
WORK WITH HIM DURING THE SAN

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:29.873
BRUNO CRISIS. WHEN I CHEERED

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.476
UTILITIES IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:33.710
WE WERE ADAMANT ABOUT MAKING

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:35.846
SURE THEIR RATE PAYERS DID NOT

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:38.348
PAY FOR THOSE COSTS HE'S BEEN A

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.651
STRONG ADVOCATE ON IMPROVING.

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:43.587
SERVICE AND RELIABILITY BUT I

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:44.988
HAVE TO STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:49.359
SOME MY COLLEAGUES THE BILL PGA

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:51.328
PGA ANY IS BEYOND REPAIR BOB TO

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.863
STRONGLY BELIEVE A DISAGREE

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.531
OBEY FEEL THAT THEIR SOLELY

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:57.401
RESPONSIBLE FOR WE ARE TODAY. A

00:48:57.467 --> 00:48:58.035
LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE

00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:00.003
LEGISLATURE A LOT OF IT HAS TO

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.571
DO WITH YOU SEE AND THEIR

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.807
FAILURE TO OVER OVERSEE ARE YOU

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:05.909
STILL LAB DURING THE DURING A

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:08.312
RAID CASES EVERY THREE YEARS

00:49:08.378 --> 00:49:09.680
AND I WOULD SEE ALL THE STUFF

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:12.082
THAT UTILITIES POLITY INTO

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:12.716
THEIR RATE CASING AND WHAT THEY

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.418
WERE GOING TO DO. THEY WOULD

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.620
ASK FOR THE MOON AND SETTLE FOR

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:18.388
THE STARS BECAUSE THEY DO YOU

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:20.590
SEE WAS GONNA GRANT THEM PRETTY

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:22.659
MUCH ALL WHAT THEY WANT WITH NO

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:25.762
OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT AND NO

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.064
CHECKS. AND ACCOUNTABILITY. SO

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.865
WE ALL OWN A LITTLE OF THE

00:49:28.932 --> 00:49:30.867
RESPONSIBILITY YEAR. BUT TO

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:34.838
SIMPLY SHIPPED. SHIP THE P. DNA

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:37.074
FROM INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY TO

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:41.278
A NONPROFIT. I'M FOR THAT. I'M

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:43.146
FEARFUL BECAUSE AN I. Q. OF

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:45.382
WORK FOR NONPROFIT. WORK OF ONE

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:46.583
OF THE BEST MOST RELIABLE

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.652
NONPROFIT IN THE STATE OF NOT

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:50.721
THIS COUNTRY BUT TO SAY I'M

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:52.022
READY TO TURN OVER UTILITY

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:54.458
COMPANY TOOK NONPROFIT I'M NOT

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.760
SURE I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:58.595
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ALLOWS

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:01.164
OUR SHAREHOLDERS THE OWN SOME

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:03.200
RESPONSIBILITY. BUT I WANT TO

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:05.769
BE VERY CLEAR WE CANNOT IGNORE

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.938
THE EIGHTY FIVE LIVES THAT WERE

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:11.908
LOST DURING THE WILDFIRE.

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.443
PLEASE ANY HOUSE SOME

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.046
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT. AND IF

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:17.814
THEY CAN'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:20.884
YES WE NEED TO HELP THEM SOLVE

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.819
THIS THERE IS NO WAY THE

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.955
TAKEOVER PGA ANY WITHOUT

00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:27.157
CREATING AGAIN SIGNIFICANT

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:30.327
REPAIR COST. BUT THE COST OF

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:33.897
INACTION IS FAR MORE COSTLY. SO

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.532
I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY I WILL

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.534
SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION BUT I

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:38.735
WILL SUPPORT IT WITH GREAT

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:41.471
CAUTION AND OPTIMISM AND MAKING

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.373
SURE THAT IT LIVES UP TO.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.142
MAKING SURE THAT IS THE CORE

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:48.612
WHAT. WE NEED FROM THE UTILITY

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:49.613
AGAIN MANY TIMES WE'VE

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:52.349
SUGGESTED THE REGULATION WE SAW

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.151
WHAT THAT GOT US LEGISLATION.

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.752
WE SAW THE DEREGULATION OF THE

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.421
PHONE COMPANY SOME FORTY YEARS

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.556
AGO ONLY TO RE CONSOLIDATE

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:01.858
BECAUSE THEY REALIZED A BUNCH

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:03.627
OF BABY BILLS DID NOT WORK.

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:05.395
EROSION OF RELIABILITY AND

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:07.731
SAFETY AND THE UTILITY INDUSTRY

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:08.932
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:11.435
DEREGULATION THAT WE PASSED IN

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.035
THE LATE EIGHTIES HERE IN THE

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.570
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:16.773
A ROAD IT CUSTOMER TRUST. IT

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.241
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:20.410
SUGGESTION OF MUNICIPAL STATION

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:22.679
I WAS WORKING WITH FOR A VESTER

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.347
ON UTILITY WHEN MANY CITY SAYS

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.383
WE'LL DO IT OURSELVES WITH

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.951
LITTLE OR NO EXPERTISE AND

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:30.020
RUNNING A ELECTRIC COMPANY IT

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.455
WILL SOON SEE I'M NOT HERE TO
