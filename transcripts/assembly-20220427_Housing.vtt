HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ARE

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:22.573
CALIFORNIA'S TOP TWO CONCERNS.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.975
AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:21.155
THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE I'M

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.390
HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET TO A

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:24.425
PLACE. SO MY HOPE ON BEHALF OF

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:26.727
MY CLIENTS WOULD BE THAT. IF

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:27.995
THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE OUT OF

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:29.196
THIS COMMITTEE TODAY THAT IT

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:32.500
WERE TO GO TO- A PLACE WHERE WE

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:35.102
COULD HAVE THAT DISCUSSION

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:36.203
RATHER THAN YOU KNOW HAVING A

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.239
BACK UP AGAINST A WALL WITH

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:39.540
HAVING A BABY SCHEDULED IT

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:41.075
APPROPRIATIONS IN A WEEK AND

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:42.476
THEN ON TO THE FLOOR WORD THOSE

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:44.278
TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS BECOME MORE

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:48.082

PIECES OF LEGISLATION ALL WITH

WE STILL HAVEN'T MOVED FORWARD

01:38:05.579 --> 01:38:08.415
ON THE GOAL TO GET PRODUCTION

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:11.051
AND THIS HAS ELUDED US- AND IT'S

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:14.622
NOT JUST CALIFORNIA TODAY ON NPR

01:38:14.688 --> 01:38:16.757
THERE WAS A OF. A REPORT ABOUT

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:19.493
ACROSS. I'M ACTUALLY THE UNITED

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:23.097
STATES AND HOW MUCH ATTAINING A

01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:25.833
SOME TYPE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS

01:38:25.899 --> 01:38:28.969
BECOMING. NOT THE AMERICAN DREAM

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:31.772
BECAUSE THERE HAVE NOT BEEN

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:33.474
ENOUGH UNITS BUILT THIS ISN'T

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.075
ONLY ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:36.944
IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:39.113
HOUSING AS WE KNOW THERE ARE

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:40.914
MANY PEOPLE READY TO MOVE FROM

01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:43.784
UP RENTALS INTO. HOUSING AND

01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:46.287
SOME WHO MOVED IN WITH THEIR

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:48.022
PARENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC NOW

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:50.324
HALF. THE READ THIS IS TO PUT A

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:51.158
DOWN PAYMENT BUT AT EIGHT

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.326
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:54.194
DOLLARS EVEN WITH THOSE

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:56.463
RESOURCES THAT THEY MAY HAVE

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.299
SAVED THERE AREN'T THE UNITS

01:38:58.365 --> 01:39:00.067
AVAILABLE. THIS JUST HAPPENED

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:02.269
TODAY THIS MORNING MY TO ON NINE

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:04.171
YEAR OLD SON- CALLED ANY WANTED

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:06.974
ADVICE- IT BECAUSE HE IS LOOKING

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:10.110
FOR A RENTAL. AND THERE WERE TWO

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:13.113
CHOICES BOTH FOR A TWO BEDROOM

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.149
AT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED NOW IN

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:17.251
ORANGE COUNTY. AND HIS QUESTION

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:20.120
WAS YOU KNOW WHICH ONE DID I

01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:21.689
THINK WOULD BE BETTER AND SO

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:24.224
THINGS LIKE PARKING THINGS LIKE

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:26.093
ACCESS TO PARKING ALL OF THESE

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.195
BUT THIS IS. ONE PERSON LOOK IN

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:30.197
WHAT WE WOULD HAVE SAID LAST

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:32.166
YEAR WAS A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:39:32.232 --> 01:39:33.967
DOLLAR UNIT. SO IN ONE YEAR

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.369
THOSE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:38.038
UNITS HAVE NOW GONE UP TO THIRTY

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:40.874
FIVE HUNDRED IN SOME LOCATIONS-

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:43.444
BUT IT IS. KIND OF HEART

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:45.913
WRENCHING TO SEE A FRIEND FIGHT

01:39:45.979 --> 01:39:49.683
BECAUSE THIS THE TRADES AND THE

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:51.018
CARPENTERS ARE OFTEN ON THE

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:54.888
SAME- TEAM AND I THINK THAT- BUT

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.257
MOVING THIS TO. RULES COULD GIVE

01:39:57.324 --> 01:40:00.861
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:04.064
TO COME TO THE TABLE I WOULD SAY

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:09.103
THOUGH AND IN. MANY WAYS. PEOPLE

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:11.572
DON'T LIKE BY RIGHT LOCAL

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:16.009
GOVERNMENTS HATE BY RIGHT-

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:19.246
NIMBIS HATE BY RIGHT MANY PEOPLE

01:40:19.313 --> 01:40:21.115
HATE BY RIGHT BUT WHY WOULD THE

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:23.550
STATE TAKE THIS STEP IS THE

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:26.253
QUESTION WHY WOULD THERE BE A

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.456
BILL TO PUSH HOUSING TO A POINT

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.525
WHERE IT IS AT BY RIGHT AND IT

01:40:31.592 --> 01:40:32.526
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:34.595
BUILDING WE HAVE NOT BEEN

01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:36.930
BUILDING AND THERE HAVE BEEN

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:38.932
MANY MANY MANY MANY PRODUCTION

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:41.201
BILLS THAT GET STUCK EVEN IF

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:42.970
THEY GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:45.506
AND THEY GET OFF THE FLOOR. THEY

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:46.373
GET KILLED IN APPROPRIATIONS AND

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.574
IT'S HAPPENED OVER AD OVER AND

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:51.712
OVER SO WHEN SOME OF OUR FRIENDS

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:53.080
WHETHER IT BE FROM THE TRADES OR

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:55.783
IN CARPENTERS SAY YOU KNOW

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:57.551
WHAT'S GOING ON WE HAVE BEEN

01:40:57.618 --> 01:41:00.988
PUSHED TO SAY YES SOMETIMES TWO

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:04.158
BILLS THAT WOULD PUT US IN A

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:06.894
FRIEND FIGHT AND I BELIEVE ME

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.228
IT'S THE LAST THING WE WANT TO

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:10.898
OR I SHOULD SPEAK FOR MYSELF

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:13.834
WANT TO DO IS TO BE IN THE

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.803
MIDDLE- A FIGHT. WE KNOW WHAT

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:17.371
THE STAKES ARE WE KNOW WHAT THEY

01:41:17.438 --> 01:41:20.107
ARE TO US PERSONALLY BUT I

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:23.110
CANNOT STAND BY AND NOT SAY YES

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:25.045
TO HOUSING PRODUCTION FOR ME

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:27.481
IT'S A MORAL DECISION WHEN WE

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:29.383
SEE AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.985
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WHICH IS

01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:33.654
TO CONNECT HOMELESSNESS TO

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:37.024
HOUSING. IT THERE IS A DIRECT

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:38.592
RELATIONSHIP TO HOMELESSNESS AND

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:41.094
HOUSING AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:42.496
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:43.630
CONVERSATION I'M SORRY BUT THE

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:45.399
TRUTH IS THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:47.601
PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:49.136
FOR THAT ARE ON THE STREETS.

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:50.904
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:53.073
WHICH MEANS HOUSING PRODUCTION

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.842
THEY'RE GOING TO STAY THERE WE

01:41:54.908 --> 01:41:56.710
CANNOT HAVE PEOPLE LIVING THREE

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:58.679
AND FOUR YEARS IN SHELTERS. AND

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:00.013
THAT'S WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.649
THOSE SHELTERS WERE BUILT FOR

I MENTION ALL THIS BECAUSE I

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:13.079
WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:15.982
THAT. THAT THESE ARE. NOT

01:49:16.049 --> 01:49:19.786
COMPETING INTERESTS- THESE ARE

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:22.756
MORAL ISSUES THAT ARE OF EQUAL

01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:25.125
IMPORTANCE AND SHOULD BE OF

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.960
EQUAL IMPORTANCE TO EVERYONE.

01:49:27.027 --> 01:49:28.495
ABOUT HAVING HOUSING HAVE HAVING

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:29.996
PEOPLE WITH THE DIGNITY OF

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:30.897
HOUSING HAVING PEOPLE THE

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:33.199
DIGNITY OF- OF WORK AND WORKER

01:49:33.266 --> 01:49:35.302
PROTECTIONS IN THE END OF A

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:43.510
LIVING WAGE AND. AND THAT WHEN

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:45.078
JURISDICTIONS SPECIALLY LOCAL

01:49:45.145 --> 01:49:46.112
JURISDICTIONS I DON'T CARE AS

01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:48.548
MUCH ABOUT THAT- THE BY PRODUCT

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:51.418
IS- LABOR TRAFFICKING THE BY

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:52.786
PRODUCT IS SUB STANDARD

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:58.825
CONSTRUCTION. AND SO- I BELIEVE

01:49:58.892 --> 01:50:03.463
THAT WE NEED TO FIND. A WAY. TO

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:05.598
RECOGNIZE OUR COMMONALITIES ARE

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:07.567
THE THINGS THAT WE CARRY ON AND

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:10.203
FIND A WAY- THE TO THE BEST

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:14.474
EXTENT POSSIBLE- UP TO FORTY

01:50:14.541 --> 01:50:16.142
COME TOGETHER ON THOSE AREAS

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:18.211
WHERE- THERE'S- BEEN

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:20.246
DISAGREEMENT. I DON'T CARE HOW

01:50:20.313 --> 01:50:21.314
LONG THE DISAGREEMENTS BEEN

01:50:21.381 --> 01:50:24.918
THERE- I THINK THAT IT'S OUR

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:25.585
OBLIGATION TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:29.089
RIGHT AND THE BEST WE CAN- AND

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:31.124
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT IN TALKING

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:33.093
WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AND-

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:34.294
CONCERNS WHETHER THERE'S ENOUGH

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.729
FOR THE STRONG ENOUGH

01:50:35.795 --> 01:50:36.296
APPRENTICESHIP LANGUAGE OR

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:37.163
ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE THEIR

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:39.032
SENSE. I AGREE WITH SOME OF THAT

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:40.600
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES LOCAL

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:41.468
JURISDICTIONS THAT IF WE JUST

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:43.536
GIVE UP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MY

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:44.671
UNFORTUNATELY MY CITIES AN

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:46.306
EXAMPLE WHAT HAPPENS YOU JUST

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:47.173
LEAVE IT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.809
THAT ARE JUST IN A MAD RUSH TO

01:50:49.876 --> 01:50:51.277
BUILD. AND THEY GIVE ALL THESE

01:50:51.344 --> 01:50:52.779
OF THIS MONEY AWAY TO DEVELOPERS

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:55.048
TO BUILD- AND THE END RESULT IS

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:56.416
ALWAYS PLEASANT IN FACT THAT'S

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:58.551
WHY DID A BILL WITH THE BUILDING

01:50:58.618 --> 01:50:59.119
TRADES A FEW YEARS BACK TO

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:00.286
DEFINED MINIMUS TO MAKE SURE

01:51:00.353 --> 01:51:02.756
WE'RE GETTING PUBLIC SUBSIDIES-

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.157
THAT THAT WE HAVE BETTER

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:05.392
STANDARDS AND PREVAILING WAGE

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:09.496
WHAT HAVE YOU- AND SO. YOU KNOW

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:11.231
. ALTHOUGH I HAVE OF STRUGGLED.

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:13.233
WITH THIS BECAUSE OF THOSE BOTH

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:14.701
NOBLE AND RIGHTEOUS COMPETING

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:16.836
INTERESTS. BUT WHAT I HAVEN'T

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:18.972
STRUGGLED WITH IS MY BELIEF. IN

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:23.743
THIS IS THIRTY THE AUTHOR- OF.

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:24.778
NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDING THE

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:28.948
URGENCY. OF OUR- OUR HOUSING

01:51:29.015 --> 01:51:30.283
AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:33.420
CRISIS THAT- BUT I WITH A

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:34.988
BECAUSE I USED TO SAY OURS ABOUT

01:51:35.055 --> 01:51:38.258
THE MOST IN THE BAY AREA BUT

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:39.826
REALLY IT'S NOT EVERYWHERE IN

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:41.161
OUR STATE- MAYBE SOME DEGREES.

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:42.962
BUT I THINK YOU CAN. BUT

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:46.900
EVERYWHERE. I'M. AND I'M

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:49.903
ENCOURAGED BY CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:51.604
THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING OF

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:54.340
LATE- WHETHER THERE OF LATE OR

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:57.277
OR NOT THEY'RE HAPPENING- AND

01:51:57.343 --> 01:51:59.512
THE OF A REFERRAL TO RULES TO

01:51:59.579 --> 01:52:01.448
GET THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT

01:52:01.514 --> 01:52:03.616
CONTINUED- MEANINGFUL UP A

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:06.252
DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:07.220
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:09.289
HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH OF THE LAST

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:10.890
COUPLE YEARS- ON THESE ISSUES

01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:13.059
BUT PUTS A LOT OF US IN

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:14.094
DIFFICULT POSITIONS THAT YOU

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.396
KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT THAT

01:52:16.463 --> 01:52:17.864
UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THE

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.432
HOUSING ISSUE WE ALSO UNDERSTAND

01:52:19.499 --> 01:52:21.234
THE NEED TO STAND WITH OUR

01:52:21.301 --> 01:52:23.403
BROTHERS AND SISTERS LABOR. AND

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:26.206
YOU KNOW I AM I AM COMMITTED TO

01:52:26.272 --> 01:52:28.041
THE BEST IMPOSSIBLE FINDING THAT

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:30.176
PATH FOR BOTH AND SOMETIMES IT'S

01:52:30.243 --> 01:52:31.744
NOT ACHIEVABLE WHEN YOU MATTER

01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:34.848
HOW MY HEART BE TRY BUT WE HAVE

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:36.382
TO TRY HARD. AND WE HAD A BIT

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:40.120
AND I HAS TO TRY BECAUSE- PEOPLE

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:44.491
ARE SUFFERING. IT AND I SEE IT

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:48.561
EVERY DAY- IN A PLACE WHERE THAT

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:49.996
SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING. IN

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:52.098
CALIFORNIA WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:54.267
SUFFERING- IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:52:54.334 --> 01:52:56.236
SHOULDN'T HAVE WORKERS WORKING

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:58.104
IN NEAR LIKE SLAVE CONDITIONS IN

01:52:58.171 --> 01:52:59.772
CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD HAVE WASTE

01:52:59.839 --> 01:53:00.607
AFTER THEY APPRECIATE THE WAGE

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:03.810
THEFT- COMPONENTS OF THIS- AND

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:05.145
AGAIN ABOUT HOW TOUGH THE

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:05.678
COMPONENTS ARE THE

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.313
ACCOUNTABILITY ASPECTS AT THE

01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:09.082
LOCAL LEVEL NEED TO BE EQUALLY

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:11.184
AS STRONG AND SO THESE ARE ALL

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:13.286
THINGS THAT I BELIEVE. CAN BE

01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:15.321
WORKED OUT WHETHER THEY WILL BE

01:53:15.388 --> 01:53:17.323
WORKED OUT OR NOT IS UP TO ALL

01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:20.460
OF US- IT IT'S UP TO ALL OF US

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:21.027
SINCERELY WANTING TO FIND A

01:53:21.094 --> 01:53:23.296
SOLUTION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:26.299
WHILE WE DELAY- THERE'S A LOT OF

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:27.867
SUFFERING THAT'S HAPPENING AND

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:30.136
I'M NOT THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:31.838
THAT SUFFERING BUT I FEEL IT-

01:53:31.905 --> 01:53:33.439
BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE I CARE

01:53:33.506 --> 01:53:34.407
ABOUT MY COMMUNITY. MANY OF WHOM

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:37.310
I KNOW- THAT THAT ARE SUFFERING

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:39.913
THROUGH THIS AND SO I JUST

01:53:39.979 --> 01:53:42.048
IMPLORE AND I PRAY THAT- ALL OF

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:44.184
US GOING TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO

01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:47.086
COME TO THE TABLE TO WHATEVER

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:47.754
EXTENT I CAN BE HELPFUL- TO HELP

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:51.124
US GET THERE. BUT I DO

01:53:51.191 --> 01:53:52.192
APPRECIATE- OF THE AUTHOR AND I

01:53:52.258 --> 01:53:53.359
APPRECIATE THE BUILDING TRADES

01:53:53.426 --> 01:53:54.494
OTHER OPPOSITION THAT REACH OUT

01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:56.429
AND HAVE. MADE IT VERY CLEAR

01:53:56.496 --> 01:53:57.730
THAT THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

01:53:57.797 --> 01:53:59.532
URGENCY OF THE SITUATION BUT-

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:02.835
THEY HAVE A VERY SINCERE- UP.

01:54:02.902 --> 01:54:04.571
DESIRE TO REPRESENT THEIR

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:06.472
INTERESTS I THINK THEIR THEIR-

01:54:06.539 --> 01:54:07.740
THEIR THEIR OPPOSITION COMES

01:54:07.807 --> 01:54:08.675
FROM A PLACE OF SINCERITY AS

01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:11.077
WELL- AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:13.146
HAVE A BUNCH OF SINCERE PEOPLE

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:15.248
IN THE ROOM. THAT THAT THAT WANT

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:16.516
TO FIND A PLACE OF COMMON

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:18.384
GROUND. I THINK IT'S ACHIEVABLE

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:21.087
AND SO- I HOPE WE CAN GET THERE-

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:22.989
I'LL BE SUPPORTING. THE BILL

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:25.658
TODAY- AND I HOPE TO DO SO IN

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:27.560
THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT MEANS

01:54:27.627 --> 01:54:29.062
THAT THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS AND I

01:54:29.128 --> 01:54:30.964
HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL. GET THERE

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.466
SO THANK YOU ALL. SO I HAVE A

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:36.069
FEW COMMENTS BEFORE WE GO BACK

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:39.372
TO THE AUTHOR- YOU KNOW I COME

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:40.306
FROM A DISTRICT IT HAS NEWER

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:42.108
COMMUNITIES- COMMUNITIES BEEN

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:44.577
AROUND A LONG TIME AND ARE NOW.

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.012
EXPERIENCING THE GROWTH. THAT

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:47.814
OCCURRED IN ORANGE COUNTY AND

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.416
OVER IN L. A. COUNTY AND IN

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:53.052
THOSE AREAS- ONE OF THE-

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:54.821
PROBLEMS I SEE WITH OUR APPROACH

01:54:54.887 --> 01:54:56.322
NOT NECESSARY JUST WITH THIS

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.091
BILL BUT OUR APPROACH IN GENERAL

01:54:58.157 --> 01:55:00.693
IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:03.062
FIX AND FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THIS

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:08.401
CRISIS IN URBAN AREAS. AND URBAN

01:55:08.468 --> 01:55:09.569
AREAS WERE BUILT A HUNDRED YEARS

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:11.671
AGO AND YES THERE ARE CHANGES

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.873
THAT NEED TO BE DONE AND THEY

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:16.876
DIDN'T ENJOY THE BENEFITS OR

01:55:16.943 --> 01:55:18.411
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:20.813
OF CREATING GENERAL PLANS AND

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:21.381
HAVING ZONING AND ALL THESE

01:55:21.447 --> 01:55:25.518
DIFFERENT THINGS- AND NOW THINGS

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:27.487
NEED TO CHANGE M. WHAT USED TO

01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:29.722
WORK BACK THEN WHEN IT WAS ALL

01:55:29.789 --> 01:55:30.657
INDUSTRIAL AND- PEOPLE WERE

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:32.892
BUILDING THINGS. NEEDS DO YOU

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:34.694
KNOW THOSE ARE SIT EMPTY AND

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:37.063
THOSE NEED TO GO OUT AND OUR

01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:39.866
NEED IS HOUSING. AND SO WE NEED

01:55:39.932 --> 01:55:41.467
TO ENSURE THAT THOSE URBAN

01:55:41.534 --> 01:55:43.736
AREAS. ARE THE ONES WHERE WE'RE

01:55:43.803 --> 01:55:45.538
FOCUSINGSOME OF OUR A LOT OF

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:48.141
OUR EFFORTS ON. AND AT THE SAME

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:50.376
TIME NOT HAMPERING THE EFFORTS

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:54.714
OF SUBURBAN AREAS. TO INCREASE

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:56.716
AND GET THEIR HOUSING BUILT

01:55:56.783 --> 01:55:58.685
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM HAVE THE

01:55:58.751 --> 01:55:59.852
PLANS FOR HOUSING BUT THEY'RE

01:55:59.919 --> 01:56:01.888
RUNNING INTO OBSTACLES. THAT

01:56:01.954 --> 01:56:07.293
CREATE- DELAYS IN TRYING TO GET

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:10.396
THESE ON THE GROUND- I WAS ON A

01:56:10.463 --> 01:56:13.333
CITY COUNCIL THAT APPROVED A-

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:17.837
AFFORDABLE HOUSING- COMPLEX WITH

01:56:17.904 --> 01:56:20.373
THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND EVEN

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.209
. FIVE YEARS AGO SIX YEARS AGO.

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:24.243
IT'S STILL GOING THROUGH THE

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:26.746
PROCESS. IN THE PROCESS IS

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:30.616
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T HEAR US.

01:56:30.683 --> 01:56:33.119
NECESSARILY YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.154
LIKE WE'RE CHANGING THE

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:36.155
WINDSHIELD WIPERS BECAUSE OUR

01:56:36.222 --> 01:56:37.924
CAR WON'T START. IN THE PROCESS

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:40.393
ITSELF IT IS CREATING THESE

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:43.396
DELAYS THE CREATE THE COST. AND

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:44.931
FRANKLY I AGREE WITH EVERYBODY I

01:56:44.997 --> 01:56:46.699
WOULD RATHER BE SPENDING A

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:49.902
LITTLE MORE MONEY. ON THE PEOPLE

01:56:49.969 --> 01:56:52.105
THAT ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THEN I

01:56:52.171 --> 01:56:54.607
WOULD FIND CARRYING COSTS

01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:58.411
STUDIES THAT ARE REDUNDANT. AND

01:56:58.478 --> 01:57:00.747
THESE DELAYS- THAT OUR OUR

01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:03.716
AGENCIES AT ALL LEVELS STATE

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:07.286
LOCAL FEDERAL AND LOCAL ARE AND

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:11.224
I COUNTY. ALL ALL THOSE ALL HAVE

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:12.725
AGENCIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:14.894
THE PROCESS TO GET SOMETHING

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:17.296
THROUGH THIS THIS DEVELOPMENT I

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:19.899
WAS TALKING ABOUT. THEY WAITED

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:23.503
TWO YEARS TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:26.038
. WITH EIGHT CD WHAT THE FUNDING

01:57:26.105 --> 01:57:27.306
FOR THAT WE HAVE MONEY THAT

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:29.942
WE'VE MADE AVAILABLE TAKEN TWO

01:57:30.009 --> 01:57:31.177
YEARS TO JUST GET THROUGH THAT

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:33.379
PROCESS. IN THE MEANWHILE COSTS

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:35.081
HAVE SKYROCKETED FOR MATERIALS

01:57:35.148 --> 01:57:37.283
AND EVERYTHING ELSE WE HAVE A

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:40.420
LABOR SHORTAGE BECAUSE- WE WENT

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:42.622
FROM BUILDING A LOT OF HOMES

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:43.689
BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AND

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:46.959
EIGHTIES. TO CREATING A BUNCH OF

01:57:47.026 --> 01:57:48.027
REGULATIONS TO SLOW THAT DOWN

01:57:48.094 --> 01:57:51.597
WHAT WE SLOWED IT DOWN. AND AS

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:54.333
THAT SLOW SLOW PERIOD CAME

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.135
WORKERS WHO USED TO BUILD HOUSES

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:58.137
HAD TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HAD TO

01:57:58.204 --> 01:58:00.406
FIND OTHER TYPES OF WORK TO GO

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:02.308
INTO. NOW WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:04.644
LABOR. AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:06.312
CATCH UP BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:07.580
APPROVE EVERYTHING BECAUSE WE

01:58:07.647 --> 01:58:09.182
DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH FLAVORS

01:58:09.248 --> 01:58:11.083
FOR THE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. SO

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:13.019
THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:14.253
WE NEED TO WORK ON AND YOU KNOW

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.322
I WOULD BE REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:18.658
A LOT OF THESE EFFORTS. IF WE

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:21.627
WOULD TAKE THIS AREAS AND I

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:23.162
CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH

01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:25.531
THEM AND THEN TAKE THE URBAN

01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:27.166
AREAS AND CREATE THAT CHANGE FOR

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:28.267
THOSE AREAS CREATE THE

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:31.737
MECHANISMS TO CREATE THAT CHANGE

01:58:31.804 --> 01:58:35.541
- RIGHT NOW IN. IN OUR AREAS WE

01:58:35.608 --> 01:58:40.046
HAVE A LOT OF LAND THAT IS ZONED

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:41.514
. FOR HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS

01:58:41.581 --> 01:58:45.084
WHICH INCLUDES THIS SO THEY HAVE

01:58:45.151 --> 01:58:47.053
TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT PROCESS

01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:49.522
TO DO THAT BUT WE'RE CREATING A

01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:51.924
MECHANISM HERE WHERE THEY CAN GO

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:53.326
INTO THE COMMERCIAL AREA. AND

01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:56.863
JUST BUILD BY RIGHT. WE SHOULD

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.130
DO BETWEEN THAT AND THE OTHER

01:58:58.197 --> 01:59:00.066
WHERE IT'S RESIDENTIAL WORDS

01:59:00.132 --> 01:59:02.468
DON'T FOR BECAUSE IN THE GENERAL

01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:05.538
PLAN OF A COMMUNITY OF THESE NEW

01:59:05.605 --> 01:59:06.939
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GROWING.

01:59:07.006 --> 01:59:08.307
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE TAKING A

01:59:08.374 --> 01:59:10.610
CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE REASONS

01:59:10.676 --> 01:59:12.378
THAT WE HAVE YOUR OF THE

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:13.980
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE EFFORTS

01:59:14.046 --> 01:59:16.449
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO. IN

01:59:16.516 --> 01:59:18.584
IN OUR URBAN AREAS THE REASON

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:20.353
THEY'RE HAVING TO DO THAT IS

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:21.821
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PLANNED OUT

01:59:21.888 --> 01:59:23.723
VERY WELL. AND SO YEAH YOU HAVE

01:59:23.789 --> 01:59:24.991
TIRE STORES NEXT TO A

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:27.693
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND SO WHAT

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.494
DID THEY GET TO LISTEN TO THEY

01:59:28.561 --> 01:59:30.897
GET THE LISTEN TO. THE IMPACT

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:32.532
WRENCHES IN THE TIRES BEING

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:34.534
CHANGED IN CARVER YOU KNOW ALL

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.569
THE NOISE AND ALL THE ADVERSE

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:39.305
IMPACTS THAT COME FROM BEING

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:41.908
NEAR A STORE LIKE THAT. SO WE'VE

01:59:41.974 --> 01:59:44.110
SEPARATED THOSE ALL OUT WE'VE

01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:46.045
HAD TO DO IT WE HAD TO GO

01:59:46.112 --> 01:59:48.180
THROUGH PROCESSES OF AIR TRAFFIC

01:59:48.247 --> 01:59:50.750
SCHOOLS WATER RUN OFF HABITAT

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:53.586
ECONOMIC BALANCE ECONOMIC

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:55.922
DEVELOPMENT BALLOTS. AND THE

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:58.190
JOBS AND HOUSING BALANCE. WE

01:59:58.257 --> 02:00:00.393
WERE TOLD AS CITIES YOU CAN'T

02:00:00.459 --> 02:00:01.594
JUST BUILD HOUSES YOU CAN'T JUST

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.596
BUILD COMMERCIAL YOU HAVE TO

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:04.664
BUILD A BALANCE OF THEM SO THAT

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.799
THE PEOPLE THAT MOVING THE

02:00:06.866 --> 02:00:07.833
HOUSES HAVE A PLACE TO WORK.

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.669
WELL WE'RE TAKING THOSE OFF

02:00:09.735 --> 02:00:12.238
LINE. THEY'VE GOT TO BE MADE UP

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:13.239
SOMEWHERE IN THE GOING TO BE

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:15.374
MADE UP IN THE NEXT GENERAL PLAN

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:16.776
BECAUSE THE NEXT JOURNAL PLAN.

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:18.711
IT HAS TO BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE

02:00:18.778 --> 02:00:20.413
TO TEN YEARS HAS TO BE. IN

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:21.414
BALANCE WITH WHAT YOU'VE

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:23.249
CREATED. SO THEY'RE GONNA WIND

02:00:23.316 --> 02:00:25.284
UP TAKING OTHER AREAS THAT ARE

02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:27.353
MORE SUITABLE FOR THIS OUT. IN

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.921
THOSE SUBURBAN AREAS. SO IT'S

02:00:28.988 --> 02:00:31.090
HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS NOT

02:00:31.157 --> 02:00:34.193
NOT BECAUSE OF THE- THE ISSUES

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.962
WITH WITH THE LABOR ALTHOUGH I.

02:00:36.028 --> 02:00:37.830
YOU KNOW I HOPE THEY CAN GET

02:00:37.897 --> 02:00:39.899
THAT ALL IRONED OUT. BUT BECAUSE

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:41.167
I COULD SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT

02:00:41.233 --> 02:00:42.702
WOULD CREATE ZONES WHERE THIS IS

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:45.204
THIS APPLIES AND IT WORKS. AND

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:49.108
IT'S USABLE. AND AND ALSO IF WE

02:00:49.175 --> 02:00:51.177
START REFORMING THE PROCESS.

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:54.246
THAT HAS CREATED THIS CRISIS. IF

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:56.882
WE RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.684
INSTEAD OF EXEMPTING THIS FROM

02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:00.186
C. QUITE AND THAT FROM CIGNA AND

02:01:00.252 --> 02:01:01.721
THEN THAT FROM SIKA. BUT WE'RE

02:01:01.787 --> 02:01:03.856
NOT GOING TO TAXICABS. WE NEED

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:05.358
TO EVALUATE IT SO IT COMES INTO

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:07.259
COMPLIANCE WITH WITH WHAT WHAT

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:09.395
OUR NEEDS ARE TODAY. AND THERE

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:11.197
ARE TRADE OFFS TO BE MADE AND WE

02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:13.699
DO AND WE ARE TRADING RIGHT NOW

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:15.935
WE'RE TRADING OFF THOSE PEOPLE

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:17.169
IN THE STREET THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:01:17.236 --> 02:01:19.071
ABOUT. FOR A PROCESS THAT NEEDS

02:01:19.138 --> 02:01:19.672
TO BE UPDATED DESPERATELY BUT

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:22.341
NOBODY WILL TOUCH. AND SO THAT

02:01:22.408 --> 02:01:23.743
YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE MY

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:26.012
FEELINGS ARE ON THIS IS YOU KNOW

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:28.080
I IT IS GREAT IDEAS GREAT

02:01:28.147 --> 02:01:30.750
INTENTIONS IT'S NOT GONNA FIX

02:01:30.816 --> 02:01:32.118
THE PROBLEM. AND UNTIL WE START

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:32.985
FIXING THE PROBLEM I RECOGNIZE

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:36.122
THAT. OUR PROCESS IS THE PROBLEM

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:38.758
LET'S ATTACK THAT. DAN ALL OF

02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:40.726
THIS OTHER STUFF IS JUST IT'S

02:01:40.793 --> 02:01:42.528
GOING TO BE ON THE BOOKS AND

02:01:42.595 --> 02:01:43.362
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:45.197
PROBLEM IN TEN YEARS. WE WON'T

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:47.466
BE HERE BUT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:49.368
BE GOING HEY WHAT THE HECK ARE

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:51.237
THOSE GUYS DOING. SO YOU KNOW I

02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:53.172
WOULD I WOULD SAY WE NEED A LOT

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:55.441
MORE WORK ON THIS. SO THAT WE

02:01:55.508 --> 02:01:57.176
CAN MAKE IT WORKABLE. FOR ALL

02:01:57.243 --> 02:01:59.178
AREAS TO URBAN AREAS THE

02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:01.180
SUBURBAN AREAS. LET THOSE PLACES

02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:02.381
TO BUILD LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:04.884
TO BE BUILDING. AND REDO THE

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:06.252
URBAN REAS TO BE ABLE TO

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:08.054
ACCOMMODATE WHAT THE NEED. SO WE

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.155
WON'T HAVE THOSE HOMELESS

02:02:09.221 --> 02:02:11.457
PEOPLE. SO WE WILL HAVE HOUSING

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:13.559
FOR EVERYBODY- BUT UNTIL WITHOUT

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:15.795
SUPPLY CATCHES OF THE DEMAND THE

02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:17.830
HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.165
TO CHANGE. THE LAST THING I WANT

02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:21.367
TO SAY IS- WHEN YOU'RE ACQUIRING

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:23.069
COMMERCIAL LAND THAT'S THREE

02:02:23.135 --> 02:02:24.937
TIMES AS MUCH- ACQUISITION

02:02:25.004 --> 02:02:27.273
COSTS. AS IT IS FOR RESIDENTIAL

02:02:27.339 --> 02:02:28.874
PROPERTY. JUST GO THROUGH

02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:31.844
GENERAL PLANT PLAN PROCESS TRY

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:33.245
TO CHANGE SOMEBODY'S. THE LAND

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:34.647
FROM COMMERCIAL TO RESIDENTIAL

02:02:34.714 --> 02:02:36.382
ZONING AND WATCHING SCREAM.

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:37.683
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY JUST LOST A

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:39.652
MILLION DOLLARS ON THE PROPERTY.

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:41.387
SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:43.189
THAT- WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER

02:02:43.255 --> 02:02:45.224
A- CONSIDER IN THESE COSTS FOR

02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:46.859
DEVELOPMENT. I'D RATHER THOSE

02:02:46.926 --> 02:02:48.828
COSTS BE SPENT ON ON THE PEOPLE

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:50.229
TO BUILD PLACES BUT WE'RE

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:52.164
SPENDING ALL THIS OTHER STUFF.

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:54.266
AND THEN. OUR OUR WORKERS ARE

02:02:54.333 --> 02:02:56.869
CUT SHORT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU

02:02:56.936 --> 02:03:00.740
ALLOWING ME TO- COMMENT ON IT. I

02:03:00.806 --> 02:03:02.641

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:44.650
AND IT DOES ADDRESS SOME OF THE

02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:45.918
STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT FACE. US

02:03:45.985 --> 02:03:47.219
AS A STATE THAT FACE OUR HOUSING

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:49.321
POLICY AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:51.524

ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST ONES

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:20.732
THAT NEED TO BE COMMITTED. AND

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:22.200
IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE RUN INTO THE

02:12:22.267 --> 02:12:23.735
PROJECT THE PROBLEM THAT IS

02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:26.204
INHERENT BUILDING FARM WORKER

02:12:26.271 --> 02:12:27.606
HOUSING WHICH IS YOU'RE DEALING

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:28.507
WITH SMALL JURISDICTIONS. SMALL

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:29.908
CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE KIND

02:12:29.975 --> 02:12:31.410
OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

02:12:31.476 --> 02:12:33.011
TO US EVEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO

02:12:33.078 --> 02:12:34.880
MUCH LESS WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN

02:12:34.946 --> 02:12:36.815
THE BAY AND IN LOS ANGELES. NO

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:38.216
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE CITY

02:12:38.283 --> 02:12:39.284
WOULD ONE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:41.086
RESOURCES THEY DID. THEY HAD AND

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:42.287

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:44.423
CDBG ALLOCATION. EVEN HAD THE

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:45.590
FOR A HOUSING TRUST FUND WHICH

02:12:45.657 --> 02:12:47.993
NOT ALL CITIES OF THEIR SIZE DO.

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:50.095
AND THEY- BASICALLY GAVE

02:12:50.162 --> 02:12:52.097
EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD TO THIS

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:53.498
PROJECT. BUT STILL NOWHERE NEAR

02:12:53.565 --> 02:12:55.067
ENOUGH TO FILL THE GAP THAT THAT

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:56.435
THAT IT TAKES TO BUILD THIS

02:12:56.501 --> 02:12:57.903

I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:18:10.215 --> 02:18:11.816
QUESTIONS. ONE IS- YOU KNOW ON

02:18:11.883 --> 02:18:12.951
THE ANALYSIS OF THE COLLEGES

02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:15.720
THAT- THE- SOME OF THE EXISTING

02:18:15.787 --> 02:18:19.557
PROGRAMS- SPECIFICALLY UNDER. AB

02:18:19.624 --> 02:18:22.394
SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR- NOTED THAT.

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:24.696
TEN PERCENT- OF THESE PROGRAMS

02:18:24.763 --> 02:18:26.331
NEED TO BE SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING

02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:28.299
IN RURAL AREAS SO THIS IS

02:18:28.366 --> 02:18:30.402
ALREADY. EXISTING LAW. HOW IS.

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:33.972
THIS BILL REQUIRING A 5% SET

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:36.041
ASIDE REALLY ADDING VALUE. SO AS

02:18:36.107 --> 02:18:37.509
YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

IF. IF YOU CAN ANSWER THEM

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:43.448
PROGRESS CERTAINLY- I THINK ONE

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:44.649
CRITICAL ASPECT IS THAT THE

02:18:44.716 --> 02:18:46.484
CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE FARM

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:47.285
FOR BILL THERE'S A PROVISION

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:50.088
THAT ALLOWS. 34% BASIS BOOSTS

02:18:50.155 --> 02:18:52.223
WHAT'S ADDITIONAL EQUITY- THAT

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.324
WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE

02:18:53.391 --> 02:18:55.193
UNDER THE LARGER FIVE HUNDRED

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:57.362
MILLION STATE TAX CREDIT. THE

30% BASIS BOOST- FOR PROJECTS

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:02.500
DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP AREA

02:19:02.567 --> 02:19:04.335
QUALIFIED CENSUS TRACT- IT

02:19:04.402 --> 02:19:06.271
PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:08.606
EQUITY TO THESE PROJECTS THAT'S

02:19:08.673 --> 02:19:09.774
NOT. PART OF THE SET ASIDE FOR

02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:11.676
THE- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

02:19:11.743 --> 02:19:14.646
DOLLARS OKAY. OKAY MAYBE I JUST

02:19:14.713 --> 02:19:16.281
ONE MORE THING THAT MISTER WARD

02:19:16.347 --> 02:19:18.383
IS I THINK THE 10% REFERENCE IN

02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:20.085
THAT HOUSES WHICH WAS EXCELLENT.

02:19:20.151 --> 02:19:22.721

02:19:22.787 --> 02:19:24.622
THE AUTHOR MAY HAVE COME 25% FOR

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:26.324
THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM THAT WE

02:19:26.391 --> 02:19:28.193
HAVE. DIFFERENT AS YOU KNOW

02:19:28.259 --> 02:19:30.595
SILENCE. FUNDING STREAMS SOME OF

ELSE THAT IT WAS READY TO GO.

02:20:21.846 --> 02:20:23.014
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO RECONCILE

02:20:23.081 --> 02:20:25.517
THIS. REMEMBER THE A QUESTION-

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:27.218
SO IF YOU TO ONE OUR PRE THAT I

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:29.687
THINK. THE PARTICULAR PROJECT WE

02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:30.822
HAVE A VERY SMALL POOL TO

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.423
COMPARE THIS TO BECAUSE THAT

02:20:32.490 --> 02:20:33.424
PARTICULAR PROJECT IS ONE OF

02:20:33.491 --> 02:20:35.193
ONLY THREE THAT HAVE. RECEIVED

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:37.428
FUNDING IN RECENT. TIMES AND MY

02:20:37.495 --> 02:20:39.030
UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO

02:20:39.097 --> 02:20:41.166
TEACH AXAPTA ABOUT THIS. RAN

02:20:41.232 --> 02:20:42.500
INTO SOME PROBLEMS AT THE LOCAL

02:20:42.567 --> 02:20:44.536
LEVEL AND RELATED TO. THE VALUE

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:46.137
OF THE CREDITS OR ANYTHING THERE

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:49.174
SO- AND YES IMPORTER THOSE THOSE

02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:50.542
MONIES CAME BACK AND WE HAD TO

02:20:50.608 --> 02:20:53.411
BE REPROGRAMMED. BUT IN ALL BUT-

02:20:53.478 --> 02:20:56.080
THAT'S NOT A TYPICAL I THINK

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:58.216
WHAT WERE- ONE PIECE OUR

02:20:58.283 --> 02:21:00.585
CONTACTS AND I UNDERSTAND. AND

02:21:00.652 --> 02:21:02.253
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT

FOR STYLING MONEY AND LEAVING IT

02:21:04.155 --> 02:21:06.925
THERE WHEN IT. IS ELSEWHERE. OR

02:21:06.991 --> 02:21:08.326
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN PART IN THIS

02:21:08.393 --> 02:21:10.028
BILL IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN FOR

02:21:10.094 --> 02:21:11.830

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:14.065
VALUABLE FOR THE REASONS THAT

IMPLEMENTING THAT POLICY MORE

02:21:27.645 --> 02:21:30.748
FULLY AND I THINK ONE OF THE

02:21:30.815 --> 02:21:32.317
CHALLENGES HAS BEEN THAT FOR.

02:21:32.383 --> 02:21:33.585

HOUSING PRODUCTION AND

02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:12.957
AFFORDABILITY ACROSS THE STATE.

02:27:13.024 --> 02:27:14.492
HOWEVER I MEMBERS AND MANY OTHER

02:27:14.559 --> 02:27:15.793
HOME BUILDERS ACROSS THE STATE

02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:16.861

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:26.337
FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPERS AND

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:26.971
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PROCESS

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:28.973

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:29.640
MORE EFFICIENTLY AND COST

02:27:29.707 --> 02:27:31.909
EFFECTIVELY. IN REALITY THERE

02:27:31.976 --> 02:27:33.344
ARE NUMBER OF REASONS PERMITS TO

02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:34.645
NOT GET REVIEWED IN A TIMELY

02:27:34.712 --> 02:27:36.581
MANNER. FOR EXAMPLE MANY PROJECT

02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:38.216
APPLICATIONS DO NOT SUPPORT

02:27:38.282 --> 02:27:39.884
PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION

02:27:39.951 --> 02:27:42.019
THE CITY NEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH A

02:27:42.086 --> 02:27:43.621
REVIEW. AND BY REQUIRING A

02:27:43.688 --> 02:27:45.356
SIMPLE CHECK. CHECKS WILL NOTE

02:27:45.423 --> 02:27:48.759
WHAT IS TO BE DONE. SOMETIMES IT

02:27:48.826 --> 02:27:50.962
IS A STAFFING CAPACITY ISSUE AND

02:27:51.028 --> 02:27:52.697
BY REQUIRING MODEL PERMITS

02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:53.931
HIGHER QUALITY APPLICATIONS WILL

02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:54.966
GET SUBMITTED. BECAUSE THE

02:27:55.032 --> 02:27:56.934
PROJECT UNDERSTANDS HOW A CITY

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:57.702
WANTS TO RECEIVE THAT

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.637
INFORMATION. SOMETIMES AND THIS

02:27:59.704 --> 02:28:01.472
IS WHERE. IT IS ACTUALLY A CITY

02:28:01.539 --> 02:28:03.307
ACTING IN BAD FAITH IN TRYING TO

02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:05.443
SLOW DOWN THE PRODUCTION OF NEW

02:28:05.509 --> 02:28:06.477
HOUSING. REGARDLESS OF THE

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:07.345
REASON THE PERMITTING PROCESS

02:28:07.411 --> 02:28:09.480
CAN UNNECESSARILY TAKE UP TO

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:10.348

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:12.483

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:13.584
BEFORE AN APPLICATION IS EVEN

02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:14.685
ACKNOWLEDGED BY LOCAL

02:28:14.752 --> 02:28:16.854

FINANCING 1100% SUBSIDIZED

AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS INCREDIBLY

02:28:33.671 --> 02:28:35.406
DIFFICULT AND DUE TO THE COMPLEX

02:28:35.473 --> 02:28:37.842
TAX SYSTEM MANY PROJECTS FACE A

02:28:37.908 --> 02:28:39.477

02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:51.755
OF BRIGHT LINES ABOUT WHAT IS

02:33:51.822 --> 02:33:53.958
INCLUDED I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:33:54.024 --> 02:33:55.059
CONFUSION IN THE CURRENT TEXT OF

02:33:55.125 --> 02:33:57.328
THE BILL AS WE POINTED OUT IN

02:33:57.394 --> 02:33:58.529
OUR LETTER WHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S

02:33:58.596 --> 02:34:00.130
OUT BUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE

02:34:00.197 --> 02:34:01.665
THE OFF RAMP THAT WAS ADDED FOR

02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:02.866
PARTICULARLY COMPLEX

02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:04.602
APPLICATIONS THAT REALLY JUST

02:34:04.668 --> 02:34:06.470
CAN'T BE REVIEWED IN THE TIME

02:34:06.537 --> 02:34:08.138
FRAMES IN THE BILL. BUT WANT TO

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:09.773
CONTINUE WORKING ON TAT PIECE

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.508
ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE WE DO

02:34:11.575 --> 02:34:13.444
HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS- WE'VE

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:14.612
CONSISTENTLY TOLD THE AUTHOR

02:34:14.678 --> 02:34:16.046
THAT WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FOCUS

02:34:16.113 --> 02:34:17.581
ON EITHER THE PROCESS OR THE

02:34:17.648 --> 02:34:19.783
TECHNOLOGY BUT NOT BOTH WITHIN

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:22.319
ONE BILL THERE ARE REAL COST AND

02:34:22.386 --> 02:34:24.888
AS THE ANALYSIS NOW NOTES THOSE

02:34:24.955 --> 02:34:26.256
WON'T BE PAID BY THE STATE RIGHT

02:34:26.323 --> 02:34:27.725
THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

02:34:27.791 --> 02:34:29.093
PASSED ON TO APPLICANTS AND SO

02:34:29.159 --> 02:34:31.028
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT OST.

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:32.696
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECENT

02:34:32.763 --> 02:34:33.931
HOUSING DATA STRATEGY REPORT

02:34:33.998 --> 02:34:35.599
FROM EACH CD YOUR OWN

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:36.934
ADMINISTRATION IS TELLING YOU

02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:38.402
THAT THIS IS A VERY COSTLY

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:40.371
UNDERTAKING TO MOVE TO AN

02:34:40.437 --> 02:34:43.941
AUTOMATED ONLINE. ELECTRONIC

02:34:44.008 --> 02:34:47.645
PERMITTING SYSTEM IS DOLLARS OF

02:34:47.711 --> 02:34:49.146
AVERAGE. WHERE DO IT AND IT'S

02:34:49.213 --> 02:34:51.115
NOT JUST THE COST OF. IT UP IT'S

02:34:51.181 --> 02:34:52.516
THE- OF MAINTAINING IT LONG TERM

02:34:52.583 --> 02:34:54.418
SO WE THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE

02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:55.319
CONVERSATION WE THINK WE SHOULD

02:34:55.386 --> 02:34:57.521
REALLY HAVE STATE RESOURCES ON

02:34:57.588 --> 02:34:58.555
THE TABLE FOR THAT. GIVEN THE

02:34:58.622 --> 02:34:59.890
FISCAL SITUATION THE STATE IS AS

02:34:59.957 --> 02:35:00.357
COMPARED TO THE LOCAL

02:35:00.424 --> 02:35:02.226
JURISDICTIONS SO. CONTINUE TO

02:35:02.292 --> 02:35:04.528
HOPE THAT THAT PEACE CAN COME

02:35:04.595 --> 02:35:05.462
OUT OF THE BILL AND WE CAN

02:35:05.529 --> 02:35:07.798

03:05:45.100 --> 03:05:46.835
IT'S A BIG PART OF WHY- WE

03:05:46.902 --> 03:05:48.437

03:05:48.504 --> 03:05:49.571

MORNING AMIR KHAN A WITH RELATED

03:07:31.506 --> 03:07:33.275
CALIFORNIA AND OF THE COUNCIL OF

03:07:33.342 --> 03:07:34.242

THE LAST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS

03:07:37.546 --> 03:07:39.247
BUILDING. UP AND DOWN THE STATE

03:07:39.314 --> 03:07:40.515
IN RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:42.184
COMMUNITIES IN THE NUMBER ONE

03:07:42.250 --> 03:07:43.418
THING THAT'S COMMON IN ALL OF

03:07:43.485 --> 03:07:44.152
THE DEVELOPMENTS I'VE EVER

03:07:44.219 --> 03:07:46.121
WORKED ON IS. NEEDING TO REDUCE

03:07:46.188 --> 03:07:47.489
THE PARKING REQUIREMENT FOR

03:07:47.556 --> 03:07:49.458
EVERY SINGLE DEVELOPMENT. OF

03:07:49.524 --> 03:07:50.926
PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ONE SIZE

03:07:50.993 --> 03:07:52.661
FITS ALL REQUIREMENTS DON'T

03:07:52.728 --> 03:07:54.162
REFLECT TODAY'S SOCIETY

03:07:54.229 --> 03:07:55.864
ESPECIALLY RENTERS-

03:07:55.931 --> 03:07:57.432
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. ACCORDING

03:07:57.499 --> 03:08:00.335
TO THE LAST CENSUS. OVER 52% OF

03:08:00.402 --> 03:08:03.405
CALIFORNIA RENTERS OWN ZERO OR

03:08:03.472 --> 03:08:05.741
ONE CAR. AND SO WE'RE REALLY

03:08:05.807 --> 03:08:07.442
BUILDING WERE THESE REQUIREMENTS

03:08:07.509 --> 03:08:09.478
ARE SORT OF SET IN PLACE OF BACK

03:08:09.544 --> 03:08:11.046
WHEN FRANKLY EVERYONE OWNED

03:08:11.113 --> 03:08:12.848
MULTIPLE CARS. AND YET WE'RE

03:08:12.914 --> 03:08:14.583
SEEING THIS ABSOLUTE CHANGE AND

03:08:14.650 --> 03:08:16.251
PART OF IT IS THE COST OF

03:08:16.318 --> 03:08:17.686
HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE PEOPLE

03:08:17.753 --> 03:08:19.621
ARE FORGOING THE COST OF CARS.

03:08:19.688 --> 03:08:20.789
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE'VE WALKABLE

03:08:20.856 --> 03:08:22.858
COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE TRANSIT

03:08:22.924 --> 03:08:23.692
AND WE HAVE THINGS LIKE RIDE

03:08:23.759 --> 03:08:26.228
CHER- ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF

03:08:26.294 --> 03:08:27.896
US STUDIES I'VE BEEN READING

03:08:27.963 --> 03:08:28.730
RECENTLY. MILLENNIALS ARE

03:08:28.797 --> 03:08:31.833
ACTUALLY VALUE ACCESS TO A CAR

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.502
RATHER THAN OWNING THEIR OWN

03:08:33.568 --> 03:08:35.470
VEHICLE. SO YET WE STILL HAVE

03:08:35.537 --> 03:08:38.640
THESE FRANKLY IN SOME CASES-ARCANE PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN

03:08:38.707 --> 03:08:40.108
ONE CASE I'VE HAD TO REDUCE

03:08:40.175 --> 03:08:41.276
PARKING. FOR PARKING SPACES PER

03:08:41.343 --> 03:08:44.646
UNIT DOWN TO ONE OR LESS. AND SO

03:08:44.713 --> 03:08:46.248
THE BILL LIKE THIS IS A STRAIGHT

03:08:46.314 --> 03:08:47.482
FORWARD IN MY OPINION

03:08:47.549 --> 03:08:48.417
COMMONSENSE WAY TO BE

03:08:48.483 --> 03:08:50.118
TRANSPARENT AND COULD PROVIDE

03:08:50.185 --> 03:08:51.253
CLARITY TO THE DEVELOPMENT

03:08:51.319 --> 03:08:53.155
MARKET. IT'S ALSO IT IN WHILE

03:08:53.221 --> 03:08:54.389
FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS A MIXED

03:08:54.456 --> 03:08:55.757
USE BUILDINGS TO ALSO TAKE

03:08:55.824 --> 03:08:58.427
ADVANTAGE. OF A PARKING THAT IS

03:08:58.493 --> 03:09:00.729
RIGHT SIZED FOR THEIR SITES. AND

03:09:00.796 --> 03:09:02.564
FOR THEIR BUILDINGS I THINK IT

03:09:02.631 --> 03:09:03.865
WILL UNLEASH A LOT OF NEW

03:09:03.932 --> 03:09:04.533
DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL IN ALL THE

03:09:04.599 --> 03:09:06.501
RIGHT PLACES. IN THE STATE NEEDS

03:09:06.568 --> 03:09:07.969
LOVI EMPTY AREAS AND AREAS

03:09:08.036 --> 03:09:09.604
AROUND TRANSIT. AND IT WILL

03:09:09.671 --> 03:09:11.640
ABSOLUTELY REDUCE THE COST OF

03:09:11.707 --> 03:09:13.108
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHICH WILL

03:09:13.175 --> 03:09:14.710
REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING FOR

03:09:14.776 --> 03:09:17.112
THE END USER. AND AS WE ALL KNOW

03:09:17.179 --> 03:09:18.914
I THINK WHEN YOU WHEN YOU READ

03:09:18.980 --> 03:09:20.248
A- AN APARTMENT THAT HAS A

03:09:20.315 --> 03:09:21.750
PARKING SPACE IT COSTS MORE.

03:09:21.817 --> 03:09:22.551
MEANING APARTMENT THAT DOESN'T

03:09:22.617 --> 03:09:27.122
HAVE A PARKING SPACE. AND SO IT

03:09:27.189 --> 03:09:28.123
WILL TRANSLATE INTO MORE HOUSING

03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:29.324

CIRCULATE PUT OUT- LAST WEEK

03:19:18.246 --> 03:19:20.682
SHOWED THAT AFTER SAN DIEGO

03:19:22.116 --> 03:19:23.017

03:20:16.104 --> 03:20:18.940
PRETTY CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK-

03:20:19.006 --> 03:20:21.509
YOU GO TO A DISTRICT LIKE MINE.

03:20:21.576 --> 03:20:23.611
61% OF THE PEOPLE COMMUTE. SIXTY

03:20:23.678 --> 03:20:27.215
FIVE MILES TO WORK. AND WHEN YOU

03:20:27.281 --> 03:20:30.551
DRIVE AROUND- IN BELIEVE ME IF

03:20:30.618 --> 03:20:33.121
WE SAID TO DEVELOPMENT HEY. YOU

03:20:33.187 --> 03:20:34.989
GUYS DECIDE HOW MUCH PARKING YOU

03:20:35.056 --> 03:20:37.658
NEED. ADOBE IS MINIMIZED AS

03:20:37.725 --> 03:20:39.894
POSSIBLE. AND- AND THEN THE

03:20:39.961 --> 03:20:42.463
PROBLEM IS. THE VEHICLES ARE

03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:44.098
MINIMIZED AND THEN SO WE HAVE

03:20:44.165 --> 03:20:46.534
PARKING SPILLING OUT INTO OTHER

03:20:46.601 --> 03:20:48.803
NEIGHBORHOODS- WALL TO WALL CARS

03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:50.705
ON THE STREETS AND IN THOSE

03:20:50.772 --> 03:20:52.807
CREATE OTHER HAZARDS THEY CREATE

03:20:52.874 --> 03:20:55.076
HAZARDS FOR. PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:20:55.143 --> 03:20:56.077
WALKING DOWN THE SIDEWALK AND

03:20:56.144 --> 03:20:58.479
TRYING TO CROSS AS THEY GET AND

03:20:58.546 --> 03:21:00.715
SO WE HOW WE WIND UP WITH SAFETY

03:21:00.782 --> 03:21:01.349
HAZARDS OUT THERE FOR THAT SO

03:21:01.416 --> 03:21:03.084
AGAIN THIS WORKS IN THOSE AREAS

03:21:03.151 --> 03:21:05.286
THAT WE WOULD TAYLOR SOME OF

03:21:05.353 --> 03:21:09.190
THESE SOLUTIONS TO URBAN AREAS-

03:21:09.257 --> 03:21:11.292
AND ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY FOR

03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:13.628
OTHER AREAS TO DECIDE WHAT IS

03:21:13.694 --> 03:21:14.829
WORKING FOR THEM I'M FAMILIAR

03:21:14.896 --> 03:21:15.997
WITH THE CITY OF LA MESA MY

03:21:16.063 --> 03:21:19.100
COUSINS LIVE THERE- AND IT

03:21:19.167 --> 03:21:22.036
ISN'T- THERE ARE AREAS THERE

03:21:22.103 --> 03:21:25.807
WHERE IT. WOULDN'T WORK AND YOU

03:21:25.873 --> 03:21:28.342
WIND UP HAVING IMPACTS TO EVERY

03:21:28.409 --> 03:21:32.280
BODY- INCLUDING- YOU KNOW WHEN

03:21:32.346 --> 03:21:35.683
PEOPLE'S. HOUSING VALUES WHAT IF

03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:37.752
YOU LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A AREA

03:21:37.819 --> 03:21:39.253
WHERE IT'S JUST HEAVILY IMPACTED

03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:41.022
BY PARKING ALL OVER THE LOOK AT

03:21:41.088 --> 03:21:42.723
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT IN THE

03:21:42.790 --> 03:21:44.459
NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THAT IT

03:21:44.525 --> 03:21:46.694
AFFECTS OUR HOUSING VALUES. AND

03:21:46.761 --> 03:21:48.396
SO PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED

03:21:48.463 --> 03:21:50.331
ABOUT THAT PEOPLE MY DISTRICT

03:21:50.398 --> 03:21:51.466
ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT

03:21:51.532 --> 03:21:54.101
THAT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE LEFT

03:21:54.168 --> 03:21:55.970
UP TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO DO WHAT

03:21:56.037 --> 03:21:59.640
WORKS FORM BECAUSE BELIEVE ME IF

03:21:59.707 --> 03:22:02.410
WE HAVE ALL PARKING LOT THE-

03:22:02.477 --> 03:22:04.412
THOSEINTO SOMETHING A TAXES.

03:22:04.479 --> 03:22:08.850
THEN IT IS A PARKING LOT SO

03:22:08.916 --> 03:22:10.718
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO- NET. BUILD

03:22:10.785 --> 03:22:13.554
MORE PARKING THAN THEY NEED. BUT

03:22:13.621 --> 03:22:16.023
LIKE I SAID SAN DIEGO WORKS. OUT

03:22:16.090 --> 03:22:18.092
IN OUR AREA DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.

03:22:18.159 --> 03:22:20.161
SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

03:22:20.228 --> 03:22:21.362
BECAUSE OF THAT IF IT WERE

03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:24.599
NARROWLY TAILORED TO URBAN AREAS

03:22:24.665 --> 03:22:26.767
I'D BE ALL OVER IT THANKS. MR

03:22:26.834 --> 03:22:28.102
GABRIEL THANK YOU MATTER CHECK A

03:22:28.169 --> 03:22:29.670
SIMILAR RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE

03:22:29.737 --> 03:22:31.839
WITH MY COLLEAGUE OVER THERE-

03:22:31.906 --> 03:22:32.840
YOU KNOW PARKING IS AN AMENITY

03:22:32.907 --> 03:22:34.308
THAT CONSUMERS WANT AND IT'S

03:22:34.375 --> 03:22:35.343
SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL LOOK AT

03:22:35.409 --> 03:22:36.577
WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHERE TO

03:22:36.644 --> 03:22:39.080
BUY WORD AROUND WHERE THEY WANT

03:22:39.146 --> 03:22:41.516
TO LAUGH AND SO I GUESS I JUST

03:22:41.582 --> 03:22:43.217
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FAITH. IN

03:22:43.284 --> 03:22:44.585
THE PRIVATE MARKET TO FIND THE

03:22:44.652 --> 03:22:45.386
APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF SUPPLY

03:22:45.453 --> 03:22:48.022
DEMAND OF PARKING AND SO I THINK

03:22:48.089 --> 03:22:48.523
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS

03:22:48.589 --> 03:22:50.091
STOPPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FROM

03:22:50.157 --> 03:22:50.591
REGULATING THOSE PRIVATE

03:22:50.658 --> 03:22:51.626
ENTITIES TO COME TO THE OPTIMAL

03:22:51.692 --> 03:22:52.693
SOLUTION FROM A SOCIETAL

03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:54.095
PERSPECTIVE SO I'M HAPPY TO

03:22:54.161 --> 03:22:56.664

03:23:11.846 --> 03:23:13.314
JUST SAY THAT. YOU KNOW RIGHT

03:23:13.381 --> 03:23:14.749
NOW WITH LIMITED RESOURCES

03:23:14.815 --> 03:23:15.883
PARTICULARLY TO BUILD HOUSING

03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:17.285
THAT. WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE

03:23:17.351 --> 03:23:19.754
OF WHAT WE'RE PRIORITIZING. AND

03:23:19.820 --> 03:23:21.489
THERE ARE SO MANY BENEFITS TO

03:23:21.556 --> 03:23:23.190
ALLOWING THESE AREAS THAT BY THE

03:23:23.257 --> 03:23:25.226
WAY ARE NOT ALL OVER CITIES

03:23:25.293 --> 03:23:26.861
THERE RIGHT NEXT TO HIGH QUALITY

03:23:26.928 --> 03:23:28.162
TRANSIT. TO BECOME A MORE

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:29.163
WALKABLE AREAS AND TO OFFER A

03:23:29.230 --> 03:23:30.598
DIFFERENT KIND OF PRODUCT AND-

03:23:30.665 --> 03:23:32.166
AS WE SAW. WE HAVE ACTUAL

03:23:32.233 --> 03:23:33.568
EVIDENCE OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

03:23:33.634 --> 03:23:35.102
PRICE OF HOUSING DOES GO DOWN

03:23:35.169 --> 03:23:37.271
AND THEY DO OFFER THOSE UNITS

03:23:37.338 --> 03:23:38.372
WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR PEOPLE

03:23:38.439 --> 03:23:39.840
WHO. WANT TO USE THAT TRANSIT.

03:23:39.907 --> 03:23:40.675
AS THEIR PRIMARY MEANS OF

03:23:40.741 --> 03:23:42.843
GETTING AROUND. AND I WOULD ALSO

03:23:42.910 --> 03:23:44.545
SAY THAT CITIES HAVE A LOT OF

03:23:44.612 --> 03:23:46.213
TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO ALSO

03:23:46.280 --> 03:23:47.882
HELP MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS. MY

03:23:47.949 --> 03:23:49.050
CITY BILL TO MUNICIPAL PARKING

03:23:49.116 --> 03:23:50.585
LOTS IN THEIR DOWNTOWN WHICH

03:23:50.651 --> 03:23:52.119
TOOK THE BURDEN OFF OF ALL THE

03:23:52.186 --> 03:23:53.287
MOM AND POP SHOPS TO PROVIDE

03:23:53.354 --> 03:23:55.222
THEIR OWN PARKING. AND IT BECAME

03:23:55.289 --> 03:23:56.490
A REVENUE GENERATOR FOR THE CITY

03:23:56.557 --> 03:23:58.292
AS WELL WE ALSO CAN RUN BUS.

03:23:58.359 --> 03:23:59.360
THAT HELP WITH THESE AND WE'RE

03:23:59.427 --> 03:24:01.495
TRYING TO ENCOURAGE CITIES TO DO

03:24:01.562 --> 03:24:03.064
IS TO. TO THINK OF THESE OTHER

03:24:03.130 --> 03:24:04.899
SOLUTIONS. THOUGH IT DOES BUILD

03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:05.700
SUSTAINABILITY. AS WELL AS BUILD

03:24:05.766 --> 03:24:07.501
THE ALLOWANCE TO BUILD HOUSING.

03:24:07.568 --> 03:24:08.970
AND SO MANY OF OUR CODES ARE

03:24:09.036 --> 03:24:10.738
STUCK IN THE PAST AND TAKE WAY

03:24:10.805 --> 03:24:12.273
TOO LONG TO CHANGE. AND THIS IS

03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:14.675
A PLACE GIVEN THE- THE CRISIS

03:24:14.742 --> 03:24:15.710
THAT WE HAVE. BOTH THE FOR

03:24:15.776 --> 03:24:17.511
CLIMATE. AND FOR HOUSING WITH

03:24:17.578 --> 03:24:18.813
THE CITY WITH THE STATE DOES

03:24:18.879 --> 03:24:20.081
HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN TAKING

03:24:20.147 --> 03:24:22.149
A LEAD. SO I DO APPRECIATE THE

03:24:22.216 --> 03:24:23.284
SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES TODAY

AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS TO LOW

INCOME PEOPLE. THIS IS A TAX

03:25:33.287 --> 03:25:34.755
CREDIT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SAME

03:25:56.844 --> 03:25:57.645
DIFFICULT- FOR DEVELOPERS TO

HOUSING PARTNERS THAT THEY'RE

03:26:23.370 --> 03:26:25.106
FORCED TO PAY THE PROPERTY TAX

03:26:25.172 --> 03:26:26.340
IN THE TIME THEY PURCHASED THE

LAND. THROUGH CONSTRUCTION UNTIL

03:26:28.509 --> 03:26:29.977
THE CLOSE OF ESCROW WHEN THEY

PAYMENTS OF MANY THOUSANDS OF

03:26:34.682 --> 03:26:36.183

THESE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS A

03:26:41.388 --> 03:26:43.324
CHANCE TO DEVELOP STABILITY.

03:26:43.390 --> 03:26:46.961
EQUITY ALL THE THINGS THAT WE

LEGISLATION- JUST A FEW QUICK

WORDS ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION AND

03:28:04.138 --> 03:28:04.805
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

LEGISLATION TO US HERITAGE

03:28:07.007 --> 03:28:09.076
HOUSING PARTNERS IS A NONPROFIT

03:28:09.143 --> 03:28:11.378
HOUSING DEVELOPER FOUNDED IN

03:28:11.445 --> 03:28:12.313
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SO WE'VE

03:28:12.379 --> 03:28:13.581
BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT TWENTY

03:28:13.647 --> 03:28:14.682
THREE PLUS YEARS WE'RE DIFFERENT

03:28:14.748 --> 03:28:16.116
THAN MOST OTHER NONPROFITS IN

03:28:16.183 --> 03:28:18.385
CALIFORNIA FOR TWO REASONS FIRST

03:28:18.452 --> 03:28:19.520
IS OUR FOCUS ON AFFORDABLE

03:28:19.587 --> 03:28:21.555
HOMEOWNERSHIP WE SURE THAT FOCUS

03:28:21.622 --> 03:28:22.656
WITH OUR FRIENDS AT HABITAT FOR

03:28:22.723 --> 03:28:24.358
HUMANITY. AND THE OTHER REASON

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:25.759
THAT WERE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE

03:28:25.826 --> 03:28:27.628
OF OUR FOCUS ON MIXED INCOME

03:28:27.695 --> 03:28:29.864
HOUSING SO WHEREVER POSSIBLE WE

03:28:29.930 --> 03:28:31.765
DEVELOP OWNERSHIP UNITS FOR LOW

03:28:31.832 --> 03:28:33.200
INCOME MODERATE INCOME MIDDLE

03:28:33.267 --> 03:28:35.836
INCOME AND MARKET BUYERS ALL

03:28:35.903 --> 03:28:36.537
LIVING IN WITHIN THE SAME

03:28:36.604 --> 03:28:39.106
PROJECT- WE LIKE TO DO IT

03:28:39.173 --> 03:28:41.508
BECAUSE OF A WE FOUND THAT TO

03:28:41.575 --> 03:28:42.643
CREATE THEIR SOCIAL OUTCOMES FOR

03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:45.012
HOMEOWNERS ECONOMIC DIVERSITY IS

03:28:45.079 --> 03:28:47.381
DIVERSITY- AND THE SECOND REASON

03:28:47.448 --> 03:28:49.049
IS FRANKLY BECAUSE THERE'S SO

03:28:49.116 --> 03:28:51.652
LITTLE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE

03:28:51.719 --> 03:28:53.954
OWNERSHIP- AT THE STATE THEY

03:28:54.021 --> 03:28:55.322
WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE PROFITS

03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:56.824
FROM DEVELOPING MARKET UNITS

03:28:56.891 --> 03:28:58.559
WITHIN OUR PROJECTS AND SELF

03:28:58.626 --> 03:29:00.394
SUBSIDIZE MODERN MIDDLE INCOME

03:29:00.461 --> 03:29:03.697
UNITS. SO THAT'S WHY WE DO THAT

03:29:03.764 --> 03:29:04.331
OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE OWNERSHIP

03:29:04.398 --> 03:29:07.701
HOUSING- ATTAINABLE AND

03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:17.244
WITH A COMBINATION OF TWO THINGS

03:29:17.311 --> 03:29:18.312
WHEREVER POSSIBLE BENDING THE

03:29:18.379 --> 03:29:20.381
COST CURVE ON THE COST OF

03:29:20.447 --> 03:29:21.615
PRODUCING HOUSING WHICH THIS

03:29:21.682 --> 03:29:23.684
LEGISLATION WILL DO AND SECOND

HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DEGREES.

03:34:26.587 --> 03:34:28.455
EXTREME HEAT WARNINGS ARE

03:34:28.522 --> 03:34:30.390
BECOMING MORE COMMON AS THE

03:34:30.457 --> 03:34:32.726
PLANET WARMS AND SEA LEVELS RISE

03:34:32.793 --> 03:34:35.128
AND IT IS THE POOR AND ELDERLY

03:34:35.195 --> 03:34:37.464
WHO SUFFER THE MOST. EXTREME

03:34:37.531 --> 03:34:39.566
HEAT IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST

03:34:39.633 --> 03:34:40.634
CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING

03:34:40.701 --> 03:34:43.503
BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY

03:34:43.570 --> 03:34:44.605
NINETEEN. THE HOTTEST DECADE ON

03:34:44.671 --> 03:34:46.807
RECORD. OFFICIAL REPORTS WERE

03:34:46.873 --> 03:34:49.142
THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY

03:34:49.209 --> 03:34:51.411
NINE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DIED

03:34:51.478 --> 03:34:53.747
DUE TO HEAT EXPOSURE. HOWEVER

03:34:53.814 --> 03:34:55.482
ACCORDING TO AN INVESTIGATION BY

03:34:55.549 --> 03:34:57.584
THE L. A. TIMES THE ACTUAL DEATH

03:34:57.651 --> 03:35:00.287
TOLL WAS ALMOST SIX TIMES HIGHER

03:35:00.354 --> 03:35:02.823
THAN WHAT WAS REPORTED. TOTALING

03:35:02.889 --> 03:35:04.891
NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS

03:35:04.958 --> 03:35:06.560
THESE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO

03:35:06.627 --> 03:35:08.829
GROW AS IT CONTINUES TO GET

03:35:08.895 --> 03:35:11.031
HOTTER. EACH YEAR EXTREME HEAT

03:35:11.098 --> 03:35:13.934
KILLS MORE AMERICANS THAN ANY

03:35:14.001 --> 03:35:17.037
OTHER CLIMATE FUELED HAZARD.

03:35:17.104 --> 03:35:18.272
LIKE OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE

03:35:18.338 --> 03:35:20.507
DISASTERS EXTREME HEAT IMPACTS

03:35:20.574 --> 03:35:22.976
THE POOR ELDERLY SICK AND VERY

03:35:23.043 --> 03:35:25.545
ON THE MOST. STATE DATA SHOWS

03:35:25.612 --> 03:35:27.514
THAT BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE

03:35:27.581 --> 03:35:30.350
LIKELY TO DIE THAN THOSE OF ANY

03:35:30.417 --> 03:35:31.418
OTHER RACE FROM HEAT. AND PEOPLE

03:35:31.485 --> 03:35:34.288
OVER SIXTY FIVE ARE ESPECIALLY

03:35:34.354 --> 03:35:36.323
AT RISK. PEOPLE DIE IN HOUSES

03:35:36.390 --> 03:35:38.158
APARTMENTS AND MOBILE HOMES THAT

03:35:38.225 --> 03:35:40.460
LACK MITIGATIONS LIKE MODERN

INSULATION COOL ROOF TECHNOLOGY

03:35:43.597 --> 03:35:45.332
ENERGY EFFICIENT WINDOWS AIR

03:35:45.399 --> 03:35:47.534
CONDITIONING OR EVEN SOMETHING

03:35:47.601 --> 03:35:49.336
AS SIMPLE AS SHADE TREES. HE

03:35:49.403 --> 03:35:51.838
DOES SOMETHING THOSE WITH

03:35:51.905 --> 03:35:54.541
RESOURCES CAN IGNORE WELL FOR

03:35:54.608 --> 03:35:57.444
THOSE WITHOUT RESOURCES IT IS A

03:35:57.511 --> 03:35:59.680
THREAT TO THEIR SURVIVAL. THE

03:35:59.746 --> 03:36:01.281
LEGISLATURE HAS BEGUN TO TAKE

03:36:01.348 --> 03:36:03.183
EXTREME HEAT SERIOUSLY AND HAS

03:36:03.250 --> 03:36:05.285
STARTED INVESTING IN PLANS AND

03:36:05.352 --> 03:36:06.720
PROGRAMS TO HELP MITIGATE THE

03:36:06.787 --> 03:36:09.589
IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT EVENTS

03:36:09.656 --> 03:36:11.458
AND TO SAVE LIVES WHAT IS

03:36:11.525 --> 03:36:13.927
MISSING IS A PLAN TO KEEP PEOPLE

03:36:13.994 --> 03:36:16.029
SAFE FROM EXTREME HEAT. IN THEIR

03:36:16.096 --> 03:36:18.632
OWN HOMES. CURRENTLY STATE

03:36:18.699 --> 03:36:19.933
BUILDING AND HABITABILITY

03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:21.768
STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT RENTAL

03:36:21.835 --> 03:36:24.004
HOUSING BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A

03:36:24.071 --> 03:36:26.807
MINIMUM INDOOR TEMPERATURE OF

03:36:26.873 --> 03:36:29.009
SEVENTY DEGREES. BUT SET NO

03:36:29.076 --> 03:36:31.244
MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE. WHEN

03:36:31.311 --> 03:36:33.413
TEMPERATURES SOAR OUTSIDE INDOOR

03:36:33.480 --> 03:36:34.848
TEMPERATURES CAN REACH EVEN

03:36:34.915 --> 03:36:37.017
HIGHER IN UNITS THAT LACK COOLEY

03:36:37.084 --> 03:36:39.353
FEATURES WHILE STILL BEING

03:36:39.419 --> 03:36:41.321
DEEMED HABITABLE UNDER THE STATE

03:36:41.388 --> 03:36:44.191
CODE. THIS MAKES LITTLE SENSE IF

03:36:44.257 --> 03:36:45.759
THE GOAL OF HABITABILITY

03:36:45.826 --> 03:36:48.528
STANDARDS IS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE

03:36:48.595 --> 03:36:50.163
AND HEALTHY IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

03:36:50.230 --> 03:36:53.166
AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SEVEN IS A

03:36:53.233 --> 03:36:55.235
MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT

03:36:55.302 --> 03:36:56.536
EVERY CALIFORNIANS LIVES IN A

03:36:56.603 --> 03:36:58.939
SAFE AND RESILIENT HOME THAT

03:36:59.005 --> 03:36:59.973
PROVIDES REFUGE FROM EXTREME

03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:02.042
HEAT. IT WOULD MODERNIZE THE

03:37:02.109 --> 03:37:04.077
STATE'S HABITABILITY CODE TO

03:37:04.144 --> 03:37:06.046
REQUIRE THAT RENTAL UNITS CAN

03:37:06.113 --> 03:37:07.080
MAINTAIN A SAFE INDOOR

03:37:07.147 --> 03:37:09.549
TEMPERATURE REGARDLESS OF

03:37:09.616 --> 03:37:10.784
WHETHER TEMPERATURES ARE

03:37:10.851 --> 03:37:14.087
EXTREMELY COLD OR EXTREMELY HOT

03:37:14.154 --> 03:37:15.322
. THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE

03:37:15.389 --> 03:37:18.625
EVERY LANDLORD TO. FOR AND AIR

03:37:18.692 --> 03:37:20.861
CONDITIONING OR ANYTHING ELSE

03:37:20.927 --> 03:37:23.530
FOR THAT MATTER. INSTEAD IT

03:37:23.597 --> 03:37:25.399
REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF

03:37:25.465 --> 03:37:28.535
STANDARDS TO ENSURE SAFE INDOOR

03:37:28.602 --> 03:37:30.804
AIR TEMPERATURE ON HOT DAYS BUT

03:37:30.871 --> 03:37:32.939
LEAVES IT UP TO THE EXPERTS TO

03:37:33.006 --> 03:37:35.275
DETERMINE HOW WE GET THERE. WHAT

03:37:35.342 --> 03:37:36.710
IT WILL TAKE TO ACHIEVE THE

03:37:36.777 --> 03:37:38.278
STANDARD WILL VERY BASED ON

03:37:38.345 --> 03:37:41.148
GEOGRAPHY AND A HOST OF OTHER

03:37:41.214 --> 03:37:42.549
FACTORS INCLUDING ENSURING

03:37:42.616 --> 03:37:44.050
CONSISTENCY WITH STATE CLIMATE

03:37:44.117 --> 03:37:46.553
GOALS. THE BILL DOES NOT DICTATE

03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:48.889
ANY OF THIS BUT INSTEAD SET THE

03:37:48.955 --> 03:37:51.458
PROCESS IN MOTION TO DEVELOP THE

03:37:51.525 --> 03:37:53.627
STANDARDS. SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE

A REASONABLE AND PRACTICAL

04:38:15.245 --> 04:38:17.614
THE ASSEMBLY AND ONLY THREE

04:38:17.680 --> 04:38:18.982
PROVIDE A CELL PHONE ACCESS.

04:38:19.049 --> 04:38:20.517
WITH THE SEVERE LACK OF HOUSING

04:38:20.583 --> 04:38:22.352
IN THE STATE. WE JUST DON'T

04:38:22.419 --> 04:38:24.120
BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION

04:38:24.187 --> 04:38:25.655
CONTRIBUTES TO THE CREATION OF

04:38:25.722 --> 04:38:27.590
MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILIES

04:38:27.657 --> 04:38:29.292

04:38:41.438 --> 04:38:45.008
BILL SEEMS TO BE A SOLUTION IN

SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AGAIN. AND

04:38:47.077 --> 04:38:49.345
IT ALSO BELIEVE WE BELIEVE THAT

04:38:49.412 --> 04:38:51.614
IT CREATES A FALSE NARRATIVE

04:38:51.681 --> 04:38:53.416
THAT PARK OWNERS AND RESIDENTS

04:38:53.483 --> 04:38:54.617
HAVE AN ADVERSARIAL

04:38:54.684 --> 04:38:56.286
RELATIONSHIP. AND THAT'S A

04:38:56.352 --> 04:38:58.088
NATION NOTION THAT WE FIRMLY

MENTIONED DURING THE LAST- BILL-

04:39:47.804 --> 04:39:50.039
I DO THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY A

04:39:50.106 --> 04:39:51.975
GOOD. PARTNER GO TO SOME EXTENT

04:39:52.041 --> 04:39:54.644
HAVING. DONE EXTENSIVELY- WITH

04:39:54.711 --> 04:39:57.580
MOBILE HOMES IN MY- IN MY CITY I

04:39:57.647 --> 04:39:59.282
OFTENTIMES WITH THE THAT THERE

04:39:59.349 --> 04:40:01.618
IS CONFLICT THAT ARISES AND I DO

04:40:01.684 --> 04:40:03.253
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S- AN

04:40:03.319 --> 04:40:05.221
IMBALANCE OF POWER WITH THE

04:40:05.288 --> 04:40:08.391
MOBILE HOMEOWNER IN THE-RESIDENCE- THAT OFTENTIMES MOST

04:40:08.458 --> 04:40:10.126
COMPANIES CAN BE RESOLVED IF

04:40:10.193 --> 04:40:11.227
THERE'S THAT BALANCE OF POWER

04:40:11.294 --> 04:40:13.196
AND COMMUNICATION- PARTICULARLY.

04:40:13.263 --> 04:40:14.397
WITH THE PRIOR BILL GOING

04:40:14.464 --> 04:40:15.265
FORWARD I THINK THERE'S A

04:40:15.331 --> 04:40:17.133
PRIVATE FIVE NUMBER TWO AND IF

04:40:17.200 --> 04:40:17.901
THERE ARE ISSUES. REGARDING

04:40:17.967 --> 04:40:19.169
MAINTENANCE- WEATHER'S

04:40:19.235 --> 04:40:21.037
MAINTENANCE AN ISSUE OF THE

04:40:21.104 --> 04:40:22.805
ACTUAL RESIDENT R OF THE PARK

04:40:22.872 --> 04:40:24.574
THAT COULD BE RESOLVED IN A IN

04:40:24.641 --> 04:40:27.410
A- IN IN A WAY THAT OTHERWISE

04:40:27.477 --> 04:40:28.011
MAYBE COULDN'T. AND OBVIOUSLY

04:40:28.077 --> 04:40:29.646
THE INTERPRETATION AND OTHER-

04:40:29.712 --> 04:40:30.780
ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE SAN

04:40:30.847 --> 04:40:32.148

RESIDENTS. AND OF HAVING THAT

04:40:37.453 --> 04:40:41.157
INTERPRETATION- IT'S A IT IS A

04:40:41.224 --> 04:40:42.125
CRITICAL IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

04:40:42.192 --> 04:40:43.860
THAT THEY ARE FULLY INFORMED OF

04:40:43.927 --> 04:40:44.260

IMPROVEMENT HERE- GIVEN WHAT THE

04:41:05.715 --> 04:41:07.050
EXISTING LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES

04:41:07.116 --> 04:41:08.751
WITH THIRTY DAYS NOTICE AND I

REPRESENTATIVE. YES BUT ALSO IF

04:41:27.203 --> 04:41:28.504

04:41:28.571 --> 04:41:30.273
COULD BE THE BENEFIT OF IT- ASK

04:41:30.340 --> 04:41:32.408

04:41:35.945 --> 04:41:36.579
BENEFICIAL IN A KIND OF

04:41:36.646 --> 04:41:38.848
INTERPERSONAL CONTEXT YEAH IT

04:41:38.915 --> 04:41:40.617
THERE ARE YOU KNOW- JUST KNOWN-

04:41:40.683 --> 04:41:44.087

YOUR SONG YOU WANNA. SHOW AN

04:41:47.724 --> 04:41:50.660
EXAMPLE OR TELLING EXAMPLE

04:41:50.727 --> 04:41:52.528
HOUSLEY BENEFICIAL. BOB THIS IS

04:41:52.595 --> 04:41:55.298
MARCEL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN

04:41:55.365 --> 04:41:57.367
THE IN THE SITUATIONS FOR THE

04:41:57.433 --> 04:41:59.435
PARK OWNERS TAKE THE POSITION.

04:41:59.502 --> 04:42:01.271
THAT THEY WILL NOT TALK TO ME AS

04:42:01.337 --> 04:42:02.872
THE ADVOCATE AND THE

04:42:02.939 --> 04:42:05.408
REPRESENTATIVE. IT'S COMPLETELY

04:42:05.475 --> 04:42:08.011
UNWORKABLE IT'S EVEN SO BAD THAT

04:42:08.077 --> 04:42:10.546
IF I SEND AN EMAIL ON BEHALF OF

04:42:10.613 --> 04:42:12.448
THE RESIDENT TO THE PARK OWNER.

04:42:12.515 --> 04:42:14.284
THEY WILL CUT THE RESIDENTS OUT

04:42:14.350 --> 04:42:18.087
OF THE LOOP THE PRESIDENT

04:42:18.154 --> 04:42:19.322
DOESN'T GET THE EMAIL. THAT ALSO

04:42:19.389 --> 04:42:20.456
WORKS THE OPPOSITE WAY IF THE

04:42:20.523 --> 04:42:22.825
RESIDENT WRITES AN EMAIL AND

04:42:22.892 --> 04:42:24.594
COPIED ME THE PARK OWNER WILL

04:42:24.661 --> 04:42:26.896
COP WILL CUT ME OUT OF THE LOOP

04:42:26.963 --> 04:42:29.098
IT'S COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE. AND

04:42:29.165 --> 04:42:30.400
THEY WILL SAY WELL MARTHA WILL

04:42:30.466 --> 04:42:32.602
EITHER TALK TO YOU WITHOUT THE

04:42:32.669 --> 04:42:35.204
RESIDENT ARE WILL TALK TO THE

04:42:35.271 --> 04:42:38.074
RESIDENTS WITHOUT YOU. SO I SEE

04:42:38.141 --> 04:42:40.176
THIS IS A REALLY POSITIVE THING

04:42:40.243 --> 04:42:42.812
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN THE PARK

04:42:42.879 --> 04:42:44.947
THAT AND THERE ARE PARKS THAT

04:42:45.014 --> 04:42:46.983
LET BOTH THE RESIDENTS. AND THE

04:42:47.050 --> 04:42:49.285
RAP I TO THE MEETINGS WE WORK

04:42:49.352 --> 04:42:52.522
THINGS. AND IT HAVE TO ASK AND

04:42:52.588 --> 04:42:55.091
BY THE WAY I HAVE NEVER HAD A

04:42:55.158 --> 04:42:56.526
SINGLE CASE. AND I'VE HANDLED

04:42:56.592 --> 04:42:58.528
HUNDREDS OF THEM WERE IN

04:42:58.594 --> 04:43:01.130
ATTORNEY HAS COME INTO THE TO

04:43:01.197 --> 04:43:03.266
THE MEETINGS. IT'S JUST IT'S

04:43:03.333 --> 04:43:06.069
JUST ME AS A NON LEGAL UNPAID

04:43:06.135 --> 04:43:09.305
ADVOCATE. SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS

04:43:09.372 --> 04:43:13.209
YOUR YOUR QUESTION- IT DOES- I

04:43:13.276 --> 04:43:14.644
MEAN IF IT'S SOMETHING IF IT'S

04:43:14.711 --> 04:43:15.912
COMMUNICATION BY EMAIL THAT CAN

04:43:15.978 --> 04:43:17.480
ALWAYS BE FORTY ANNOYING BUT I

04:43:17.547 --> 04:43:19.082
CAN ALWAYS BE FORWARDED THE

04:43:19.148 --> 04:43:20.950
IMPORTANT POINT I THINK IS THAT.

04:43:21.017 --> 04:43:24.420
ANY AN OWNER AND THEIR

04:43:24.487 --> 04:43:26.255
REPRESENTATIVES ARE ON THE SAME

04:43:26.322 --> 04:43:27.590
PAGE AGAIN IN THE SAME SENSE OF

04:43:27.657 --> 04:43:29.058
INFORMATION THEY CAN DECIDE. HOW

04:43:29.125 --> 04:43:30.793
TO PROCEED- THREE DISAGREEMENTS

04:43:30.860 --> 04:43:35.732
HOPEFULLY TOGETHER- IN HI.

04:43:35.798 --> 04:43:37.367
CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO. AND SEE

04:43:37.433 --> 04:43:39.235
THE LAW TIGHTENS THE THAT THAT

04:43:39.302 --> 04:43:40.536
WOULD BE REQUIRED THAT THEY

04:43:40.603 --> 04:43:42.138
WOULD BE A TO PARTICIPATE. IN

04:43:42.205 --> 04:43:42.772
SUCH MEETINGS TOGETHER- YOU'LL

04:43:42.839 --> 04:43:44.240
BE BEYOND THAT IS THERE ANYTHING

04:43:44.307 --> 04:43:46.008
WITH THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AND

04:43:46.075 --> 04:43:47.610
THEN I'M SORRY I'M I'M STILL

04:43:47.677 --> 04:43:48.244
FUNDAMENTALLY NOT UNDERSTANDING

04:43:48.311 --> 04:43:50.079
WHY THAT'S- WHAT THAT'S A

04:43:50.146 --> 04:43:52.548
DISAGREEABLE THINGS. WELL IF

04:43:52.615 --> 04:43:54.484
CHRIS WAS SECOND FROM WMA THE

04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:55.818
EXISTING AMARILLO ALREADY DEALS

04:43:55.885 --> 04:44:00.523
WITH MOST OF THIS ALL RIGHT. SO-THAT'S WHY WE JUST WE FAIL TO

04:44:00.590 --> 04:44:03.693
UNDERSTAND WHY THE BILL IS EVEN

04:44:03.760 --> 04:44:06.662
NECESSARY. YEAH AND I WOULD JUST

04:44:06.729 --> 04:44:08.598
ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER I MEAN THAT

04:44:08.664 --> 04:44:10.533
WE DO I THINK HAVE A LITTLE BIT

04:44:10.600 --> 04:44:11.567
OF A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. IN

04:44:11.634 --> 04:44:13.836
TERMS OF THE VALUE AND PURPOSE

04:44:13.903 --> 04:44:15.371
OF THE EXISTING LAW VERSUS WHAT

04:44:15.438 --> 04:44:16.038
IS BEING AMENDED HERE TODAY- YOU

04:44:16.105 --> 04:44:17.540
KNOW AND AGAIN AGAIN I'LL

04:44:17.607 --> 04:44:19.409
REITERATE WHERE I STARTED WHICH

04:44:19.475 --> 04:44:19.942
IS WE DO APPRECIATE THE

04:44:20.009 --> 04:44:21.544
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TODAY

04:44:21.611 --> 04:44:24.313
BUT- THE- THE EXISTING LAW. AS

04:44:24.380 --> 04:44:26.149
PARK OWNERS IS THAT WE REPRESENT

04:44:26.215 --> 04:44:27.784
VIEW IT. IS ABOUT HAVING

04:44:27.850 --> 04:44:29.519
CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION AND-

04:44:29.585 --> 04:44:31.888
IN A NON LITIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT

04:44:31.954 --> 04:44:33.423
AND OF COURSE WE JUST HEARD FROM

04:44:33.489 --> 04:44:34.757
AN ADVOCATE BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE

04:44:34.824 --> 04:44:36.392
WHO WILL WE ARE EXPANDING THIS

04:44:36.459 --> 04:44:38.194
TO IN THE BILL. OUR ATTORNEYS

04:44:38.261 --> 04:44:39.095
WHO REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL

04:44:39.162 --> 04:44:41.564
RESIDENTS EXISTING LAW IS QUITE

04:44:41.631 --> 04:44:44.300
CLEAR THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF

04:44:44.367 --> 04:44:46.736
GROUPS OF RESIDENTS. PARK OWNERS

04:44:46.803 --> 04:44:47.737
MUST MEET WITH BUT NOT

04:44:47.804 --> 04:44:49.372
REPRESENTATIVES IN INDIVIDUAL

04:44:49.439 --> 04:44:51.374
RESIDENTS. THIS IS NOT A LEGAL

04:44:51.441 --> 04:44:53.409
PROCEEDING IT'S SIMPLY A MEET

04:44:53.476 --> 04:44:55.077
AND CONSULT THE IDEA IS TO HAVE

04:44:55.144 --> 04:44:56.546
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN

04:44:56.612 --> 04:44:58.548
THE RESIDENT. THE PARK OWNER IT

04:44:58.614 --> 04:44:59.849
DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THE

04:44:59.916 --> 04:45:01.083
RESIDENTS LEGAL REMEDIES AFTER

04:45:01.150 --> 04:45:02.585
THE FACT. AND SO FROM OUR

04:45:02.652 --> 04:45:04.554
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THERE IS A

04:45:04.620 --> 04:45:06.923
RISK THAT THE DISCUSSION BECOMES

04:45:06.989 --> 04:45:07.757
MORE LITIGIOUS IT IF A PARK

04:45:07.824 --> 04:45:10.359
OWNERS COMPELLED TO MEET. WITH A

04:45:10.426 --> 04:45:11.727
RESIDENT AND THE RESIDENTS. I

04:45:11.794 --> 04:45:13.629
MEAN FOR AS AT THE ALLOWED INTO

ATTORNEY AS A DESIGNATED

04:45:16.265 --> 04:45:18.034
REPRESENTATIVE. THEY ARE LIKELY

04:45:18.100 --> 04:45:18.968
OF COURSE TO BRING IN THEIR OWN

NOT BE BENEFICIAL FOR HOUSING

05:23:56.717 --> 05:23:58.452
DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDES A

05:23:58.519 --> 05:24:00.387
CARROT FOR CITIES WHO MEET THEIR

05:24:00.454 --> 05:24:03.457
ANNUAL. OUR HAVE MET THEIR

05:24:03.524 --> 05:24:05.325

NUMBERS AND INCLUDING LOW INCOME

05:24:07.261 --> 05:24:10.130
HOUSING. WHILE LARGE CITIES WITH

05:24:10.197 --> 05:24:12.466
NEARLY FULLY DEVELOPED ARE THAT

05:24:12.533 --> 05:24:13.467
ARE NEARLY FULLY DEVELOP

05:24:13.534 --> 05:24:15.002
STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING

05:24:15.068 --> 05:24:17.070
IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STATE

05:24:17.137 --> 05:24:18.672
NEEDS MASTER PLAN CITIES HAVE

05:24:18.739 --> 05:24:20.474
CAREFULLY MAPPED OUT THERE

05:24:20.541 --> 05:24:22.509
HOUSING AND BUSINESS AREAS. THIS

05:24:22.576 --> 05:24:25.312
BILL WILL ALLOW IN VERY RARE IN

05:24:25.379 --> 05:24:28.115
PRESCRIPTIVE CASES A CITY TO USE

05:24:28.182 --> 05:24:30.350
THIS LAND FOR OTHER PURPOSES

05:24:30.417 --> 05:24:32.052
THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE

05:24:32.119 --> 05:24:34.922
HELPFUL OR USEFUL. SO I WANTED

05:24:34.988 --> 05:24:36.056
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN

05:24:36.123 --> 05:24:38.625
PLAIN ENGLISH WHAT THIS BILL WHY

05:24:38.692 --> 05:24:41.728
THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AS THE

05:24:41.795 --> 05:24:44.631
SURPLUS LAND ACT YOU KNOW- HAS

05:24:44.698 --> 05:24:47.134
PUT CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON LAND

05:24:47.201 --> 05:24:49.269
THAT CITIES HAVE. MAY BE HELD

05:24:49.336 --> 05:24:53.307
FOR A WHILE- THAT CITIES MAY USE

05:24:53.373 --> 05:24:58.378
FOR- DOING A LAND LEASE- THAT IS

05:24:58.445 --> 05:25:00.881
NOT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. AND

05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:05.485
SO WHAT THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DO

05:25:05.552 --> 05:25:06.587
IF THEY ARE MEETING THEIR

05:25:06.653 --> 05:25:08.088
HOUSING NEEDS. IS TO DEVELOP

05:25:08.155 --> 05:25:10.557
THOSE. THOSE ARE TO ALLOW THOSE

05:25:10.624 --> 05:25:12.559
DIVINE TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE

05:25:12.626 --> 05:25:15.429
THIS LAND. WOULD NOT ORDINARILY

05:25:15.495 --> 05:25:19.766
BE- IT'S NOT GOING TO GET

05:25:19.833 --> 05:25:22.002
DEVELOPED IF THE CITY IS HOLDING

05:25:22.069 --> 05:25:24.137
IT AND IT'S AN SAY CIVIC CENTER

05:25:24.204 --> 05:25:26.907
AREA AND THE PLAN FOR THE CITY

05:25:26.974 --> 05:25:29.142
WAS TO HOLD THIS AND USE THE

05:25:29.209 --> 05:25:30.878
LAND LEASE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL

05:25:30.944 --> 05:25:33.046
DEVELOPMENT FOR OFFICE AND WHICH

05:25:33.113 --> 05:25:35.249
PROVIDES JOBS AND IT PROVIDES

05:25:35.315 --> 05:25:36.817
JOBS FOR BOTH WHEN THE

05:25:36.884 --> 05:25:38.318
CONSTRUCTION HAPPENS AND ALSO

05:25:38.385 --> 05:25:40.120
AFTERWARDS AND IT PROVIDES

05:25:40.187 --> 05:25:43.557
SUPPORT OF JOBS. AND SERVICES

05:25:43.624 --> 05:25:45.592
FOR THEIR SURROUNDING AREAS

05:25:45.659 --> 05:25:48.128
WHICH HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

05:25:48.195 --> 05:25:51.231
THEM- THE- THIS TYPE OF LAND AND

05:25:51.298 --> 05:25:53.367
THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO

05:25:53.433 --> 05:25:55.802
NARROWLY WRITTEN. THIS TYPE OF

05:25:55.869 --> 05:25:57.838
LAND WOULD NOT BE USED. IT WOULD

05:25:57.905 --> 05:25:59.706
NOT BE OFFERED IT WOULD NEVER BE

05:25:59.773 --> 05:26:01.308
OFFERED UP BECAUSE THE CITY'S

05:26:01.375 --> 05:26:04.544
CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THAT LAND

05:26:04.611 --> 05:26:06.446
TURNED INTO SOMETHING THAT.

05:26:06.513 --> 05:26:08.248
ABSOLUTELY OBLITERATES THEY'RE

05:26:08.315 --> 05:26:11.785
PLANNING FOR A DOWNTOWN CIVIC

05:26:11.852 --> 05:26:15.055
CENTER TYPE SPACE. AND THIS

05:26:15.122 --> 05:26:16.590
WOULD NORMALLY I WOULD SAY WOULD

05:26:16.657 --> 05:26:18.125
I WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THIS A

05:26:18.191 --> 05:26:19.726
DISTRICT BILL IF I COULD BECAUSE

05:26:19.793 --> 05:26:21.561
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH ONE OF

05:26:21.628 --> 05:26:23.263
THE CITIES THAT. ARE BROUGHT

05:26:23.330 --> 05:26:24.564
THIS FORWARD AND I'M FAMILIAR

05:26:24.631 --> 05:26:27.301
WITH IT BECAUSE- TWENTY YEARS

05:26:27.367 --> 05:26:30.170
AGO- I WAS INVOLVED IN THE

05:26:30.237 --> 05:26:32.472
PLANNING FOR THIS COMMUNITY.

05:26:32.539 --> 05:26:34.041
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND THIS

05:26:34.107 --> 05:26:36.310
WAS PART OF THAT PLAN WAS

05:26:36.376 --> 05:26:37.611
INSTEAD OF BURDENING THE

05:26:37.678 --> 05:26:41.014
TAXPAYERS BY TAKING OUT BONDS IN

05:26:41.081 --> 05:26:42.616
BUILDING THESE ADDITIONAL OFFICE

05:26:42.683 --> 05:26:45.018
SPACE. THE LUCK OF THE LAND FOR

05:26:45.085 --> 05:26:47.254
THE CIVIC CENTER WOULD HOUSE THE

05:26:47.321 --> 05:26:48.956
POLICE STATION LIBRARY SENIOR

05:26:49.022 --> 05:26:51.758
CITIZEN CENTER CITY HALL AND

05:26:51.825 --> 05:26:53.827
THEN THE LAND LEASES WOULD BE

05:26:53.894 --> 05:26:56.463
ABLE TO HELP PAY FOR THE BONDS

05:26:56.530 --> 05:26:57.831
FOR THOSE OTHERS. AND IN THE

05:26:57.898 --> 05:27:00.834
MEANWHILE THIS AREA IS OUR OUR-

05:27:00.901 --> 05:27:03.704
GUITAR JONES FOR. HIGHER DENSITY

05:27:03.770 --> 05:27:05.672
DEVELOPMENT. WHEN WE SPOKE WITH

05:27:05.739 --> 05:27:07.274
OTHER CITIES ABOUT THIS THEY

05:27:07.341 --> 05:27:09.042
WERE HAVING THE SAME TYPES OF

05:27:09.109 --> 05:27:10.610
ISSUES. SO WE REALLY NARROWLY

05:27:10.677 --> 05:27:13.580
CRAFTED THIS. SO THAT IT WOULD

05:27:13.647 --> 05:27:16.450
ONLY BE ABLE TO BE ACCESSED. AND

05:27:16.516 --> 05:27:18.652
USED IF CITIES WERE MEETING

05:27:18.719 --> 05:27:20.821
THEIR HOUSING NEEDS AND ALSO

05:27:20.887 --> 05:27:21.888
WHICH INCLUDE THE AFFORDABLE

05:27:21.955 --> 05:27:23.523
HOUSING ELEMENT. IN THIS

05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:25.192
PARTICULAR INSTANCE THERE'S

05:27:25.258 --> 05:27:26.326
AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT ACROSS

05:27:26.393 --> 05:27:27.894
THE STREET AND THERE'S MORE

05:27:27.961 --> 05:27:28.795
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH I

05:27:28.862 --> 05:27:32.232
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- JUST DOWN

05:27:32.299 --> 05:27:33.667
AROUND THE BLOCK FROM HERE. THIS

05:27:33.734 --> 05:27:35.736
CIVIC CENTER WAS MEANT TO DO

05:27:35.802 --> 05:27:37.404
THAT IN OTHER CITIES THAT ARE

05:27:37.471 --> 05:27:40.273
DEVELOPING LIKE OUR CITY HAS

05:27:40.340 --> 05:27:41.208
BEEN IN MARIETTA. ARE HAVING THE

05:27:41.274 --> 05:27:43.610
SAME ISSUES. SO WE CAN NARROWLY

05:27:43.677 --> 05:27:46.279
CRAFTED BILL THAT HELPS THEM GET

05:27:46.346 --> 05:27:48.849
PAST THAT HURDLE. WE CAN GET

05:27:48.915 --> 05:27:51.818
THOSE LANDS USE USABLE FOR THOSE

05:27:51.885 --> 05:27:54.988
COMMUNITIES SO THAT THE EXIST-

05:27:55.055 --> 05:27:57.991
THE BUILDING OF THE OTHER- THE

05:27:58.058 --> 05:27:59.726
REST OF THE HOUSING PART IS

05:27:59.793 --> 05:28:01.561
SUPPORTED BY THAT THAT VERY

05:28:01.628 --> 05:28:04.031
DEVELOPMENT. SO THAT'S WHY I

05:28:04.097 --> 05:28:06.967
BROUGHT THIS BILL- READING THE

05:28:07.034 --> 05:28:09.036
BILL LANGUAGE IT'S VERY

05:28:09.102 --> 05:28:10.504
CONVOLUTED IT'S VERY HARD TO

05:28:10.570 --> 05:28:12.839
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- WE HAD TO

05:28:12.906 --> 05:28:14.641
CHANGE IT INTO. YOU KNOW BILL

05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:17.377
LANGUAGE I GUESS. AND BUT WHAT

05:28:17.444 --> 05:28:22.015
IT DOES IS JUST ALLOW CITIES. TO

05:28:22.082 --> 05:28:25.052
HAVE THAT SMALL EXEMPTION IN

05:28:25.118 --> 05:28:26.987
VERY PARTICULAR CASES. JUST LIKE

05:28:27.054 --> 05:28:29.056
THE PREVIOUS ONE WE JUST HAD IT

05:28:29.122 --> 05:28:30.590
WAS A PARTICULAR CASE THAT

05:28:30.657 --> 05:28:31.591
THAT'S HOW YOU SOLVE THE

05:28:31.658 --> 05:28:35.062
PROBLEM. AND SO WITH THAT. I DO

05:28:35.128 --> 05:28:38.965
HAVE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE

05:28:39.032 --> 05:28:39.900
CALIFORNIA CITIES ASSISTANT

05:28:39.966 --> 05:28:42.469
DIRECTOR. JASON RYAN WHO'S GOING

05:28:42.536 --> 05:28:44.604

CALIFORNIA CITIES A GIVEN LATE

05:28:47.441 --> 05:28:49.276
HOUR OF GRIEF. WE BELIEVE THIS

05:28:49.342 --> 05:28:51.344
BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I

05:28:51.411 --> 05:28:52.746
THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE NEED

05:28:52.813 --> 05:28:54.748
TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. IT IS

05:28:54.815 --> 05:28:55.916
NEARLY TAYLOR LIKE THE AUTHOR

05:28:55.982 --> 05:28:56.983
HAS MENTIONED- IT IT'S ONLY

05:28:57.050 --> 05:28:59.486
GOING TO PROVIDE THE FEXIBILITY

05:28:59.553 --> 05:29:00.020
TO JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

05:29:00.087 --> 05:29:01.021
MEETING OR EXCEEDING THEIR

05:29:01.088 --> 05:29:02.322
PROGRESS TOWARDS ARENA ON THE

05:29:02.389 --> 05:29:03.790
GOALS OF THE STATE HAS GIVEN US

05:29:03.857 --> 05:29:05.859
A CITY'S GONNA HAVE TO BE VERY

05:29:05.926 --> 05:29:07.127
VERY AGGRESSIVE NOT ONLY. IN

05:29:07.194 --> 05:29:08.061
REMOVING BARRIERS AT THE LOCAL

05:29:08.128 --> 05:29:09.596
LEVEL BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO

05:29:09.663 --> 05:29:10.831
ACTIVELY SEEK ALL SORTS OF

05:29:10.897 --> 05:29:13.366
FUNDING IN ORDER TO GET THOSE

05:29:13.433 --> 05:29:14.000
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUILT.

05:29:14.067 --> 05:29:15.602
HISTORY SHOWN- THAT NOT VERY
