SB CIVIL SOME WILL PROVIDE KERN FUTURO RESIDENTS OF CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES WITH A SENSE OF SECURITY REGARDING THE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COMMITMENT THEY MAKE IN RETURN FOR LIFELONG HOME HEALTH CARE. THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES ACROSS TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT NUMBER IS LIKELY TO GROW TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR HEALTH AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA'S RAPIDLY GROWING SENIOR POPULATION. CONTINUING CARE FACILITIES ARE AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION FOR SENIORS SEEKING A LONG TERM LIVING ARRANGEMENTS. BECAUSE THEY OFFER VARIOUS LEVELS OF KERR THAT ADAPT. TO THE NEEDS OF RESIDENCES H. ALLOWING THEM TO AGE IN PLACE. ENTRANCE FEES TO THESE FACILITIES ARE STEEP. THE AVERAGE DEPOSIT FOR CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON TOP OF THAT KIND OF HAVE TO HAVE THE DEPOSIT. RESIDENTS OF COURSE PAY ONGOING MONTHLY SERVICE FEES. IN THE THOUSANDS TYPICALLY. PRESENTS OFTEN SELL THEIR HOMES SPEND THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO ENTER CONTINUE TO RETURN COMMITTEES BECAUSE THEY EXPECT. THEY WERE STABLE HOUSING AND CARE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR LIFETIMES. HOWEVER THEY'VE BEEN INSTANCES WERE CONTINUING CARE PROVIDERS MISMANAGED HER FINANCES AND EITHER ALTER THE RESIDENT AGREEMENTS.

A QUARTERLY UPDATES ON THEIR PROGRESS TO REMEDY THE FINANCIAL ISSUES. TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO RESIDENTS OF THE BILL STATES THAT PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A FINANCIAL PLAN. BUT SURE THAT FINANCIAL PLAN ALONG WITH ANY QUARTERLY REPORTS TO THE CURRENT RESIDENCE. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE FINANCIAL PLANNING QUARTERLY REPORTS BE SHARED WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO BECOME A RESIDENT PRIOR TO THE REMEDIATION OF EXISTING FINANCIAL ISSUES. SB SEVEN OH SEVEN.

I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD CLEARLY IF A SENIOR OR SEEN A COUPLE YOU KNOW BASICALLY TAKE THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. AND IN EXCHANGE FOR A PROMISE WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THAT PROMISES KEPT AND- CERTAINLY. OR ONE MIGHT QUESTIONS IS THAT- WHAT HE SEES THE ROLE OF THE PARM SOCIAL SERVICES IN TERMS OF TRYING TO OVERSEE AND ENSURE THAT PROMISES CAP SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IN YOUR BILL FOR EXAMPLE- THAT THEY DO NEED TO TRY THESE REPORTS- SO THEY'RE GONNA GET REPORTS- THEY ALSO TRIED REPORTS TO PEOPLE WHO I GUESS ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING- AND ARE ENGAGING IN THIS. ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S FOR EXAMPLE ANY STANDARDS AVAILABLE SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO IT DATA DUMPED THE FINANCIALS ON. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE AREN'T SURE HOW TO INTERPRET THAT IT'S THERE SOME ASSISTANCE DSS IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE TO PEOPLE SOME RATING SYSTEM LIKE THE- YEAH FINANCIALLY THEIR GREEN YELLOW RED ORANGE OR SOMETHING OR- SERVICES SO TO ENTER PRINT THE DATA THAT THEY MAY BE GETTING AND ALSO OF COURSE ONCE YOU READY MADE THAT PURCHASE AND YOU'RE A- MADE THAT COMMITMENT. AND NOW YOU'RE NOT. IN A FACILITY OR US ARE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT'S- GET FINANCIAL TROUBLE. WHAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE- SHOULD WE TRY TO RENDER BECAUSE THEY EVER PUT THEIR MONEY AND SELF I REALIZE THIS IS A BIT LARGER IN YOUR BILL- BUT IF YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH ME ABOUT WHAT WE USE AND HOW YOU SEE- THESE THINGS MIGHT BE ADDRESSED AND- HOW YOUR BILL SERVED GETS US IN THAT DIRECTION WHICH I KNOW IT IS A POSITIVE MOVE AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR INTO THROUGH THE CHAIR A RESPOND TO- E. RIGHT THIS BILL- BY. DID HAS NOT. AT LEAST AT THIS POINT ATTEMPTED TO TAKE ON OF THE BROADER ISSUE OF REMEDIES OR- OR SPECIFIC REGULATORY PENALTIES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S REALLY. AT THIS STAGE. TO TAKE THAT FIRST STEP WHICH I THINK IS BOTH TECHNICAL IMPORTANT SAME TIME OF REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY- SO THAT. EVEN IN EVEN. EVEN IN IN THE FREE MARKET SITUATION OF COPY AT EMPTOR- HE'S YOU LEAST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EVEN IF YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR A FACILITY LIKE THIS TO GET A HOLD OF FINANCIALS FOR- A- AN ORGANIZATION- THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SPEND. YOU KNOW PERHAPS A THIRD OF A MILLION DOLLARS OF YOUR LIFE SAVINGS ARE YOUR FAMILIES- BUT DOLLARS TO GET IN WE HAVE. HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT YOU ALLUDE TO. OF WHICH I THINK ARE IMPORTANT I THINK THAT IF NOT WITH THIS BILL THAT ARE EVENTUALLY IMPORT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE UP FOR EXAMPLE. A AND AGAIN NOT TO COMPLICATE THINGS TODAY ON THIS BILL BUT- HI THE USE OF THE USE OF REAL ESTATE LEASE CONTRACTS AS OPPOSED TO. CONTRACTS THAT ARE TIED TO THESE KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS. IS BOTHERSOME TO ME AND TO OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE ONE HAND- YOU KNOW THE REMEDIES AS YOU KNOW AS WE ALL KNOW UNDER THOSE KIND OF CONTRACTS- VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND VERY LIMITED AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY BEING ABLE TO- HINO TO. A PERHAPS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A BROADER MENU OF REMEDIES. THEY WANT TO STAY THERE- MAYBE THEY WANT TO STAY THERE AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT RETALIATED AGAINST FOR BRINGING UP- ISSUES- OF CONCERN ABOUT THE VIABILITY THEIR INVESTMENT SO I DO THINK THAT. MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS LIKE THAT ALONG THE WAY- I DON'T KNOW- IF THE BEEF WE'LL GET TO THE POINT OF FURTHER AMENDMENTS TO GET INTO THAT AREA- BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN ALONG THE WAY TO- YOU KNOW TO TRY TO DELAY. DEAL WITH SOME MORE OF THE DETAILS- THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I THINK IT I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO TRY TO PUT ALL THE REMEDIES INTO THE SIGHTINGS ABOUT REPORT BUT A BILL FROM THE MOVING ON TRANSPARENCY- CERTAINLY ONCE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE MOVE TO BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME- BUT I DID WANT TO SERVE POLICE LATER DISCUSSION OPEN WHETHER IT'S IN THIS BILL IN THE FUTURE BILL- TO. START YOU KNOW ONCE WE HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY WE ALSO NEED TO THEN THINK ABOUT REMEDIES AND- YEAH WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A SENIOR SO YOU GOT SENIORS ARE ENTERING THEY THEY THEY AT LEAST HAVE SOME MORNING ONCE YOU'RE IN THERE YOU'RE VERY COMMITTED THAT MONEY IT'S NOT THAT YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF THE MONEY TO GET YOURSELF BACK OUT AGAIN SO WE'VE WE'VE GOT THINK ABOUT REMEDIES AS WELL.

SEVEN ZERO SEVEN THAT BILL IS OUT WITH THE- BOAT OF. FIVE ZERO THANK YOU AND I'M TO. BE SIX OR NINE IT'S OKAY THANK YOU SO GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB SIX ZERO NINE WHICH ESTABLISHES CAL PRESSION PLACEMENT AND TRAINING EXPANSION ND IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND I'M HAPPY TO SET THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY I OFTEN. YEAH I ASK MYSELF. IS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE OUT THROUGH OUR WORK AND I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR WORK HERE IS VERY CRITICAL. NOW MORE THAN EVER IN THE PAST YEAR OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION JOBS HAVE BEEN LOST AS A RESULT OF THE COLBERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SOME ARE PREDICTED THAT MANY OF THOSE JOBS MAY NOT RETURN FOR YEARS OF EVER. THE REALITY IS THAT MANY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO OPPORTUNITIES. THE LOSS OF JOBS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR JOB TRAINING AND RESKILLING SERVICES THAT WILL PREPARE IMPACTED WORKERS TO RETURN TO APPOINTMENTS. AND ACCESS QUALITY JOBS WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS PROGRAM WILL DO SB SIX ZERO NINE BUILT UPON AN ALREADY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BY REQUIRING THE STATE TO SEEK OUT CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE INTO SERVICES THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. AND FOCUS ON SERVICE. SPECIFIED POPULATIONS INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS MIGRANT AND SEASONAL FARMWORKERS AND YOUTH WHO ARE IN OR HAVE AGED OUT OF THE FOSTER CAR SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO THE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OFFERED UNDER THIS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS CAN RECEIVE PAYMENTS FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION LIKE TRANSPORTATION. AND CHILD CARE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF T. AND T. IS THE AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO PAY FOR PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION. OF CALFRESH IAN T. STATES CAN ALSO OBTAIN 50% FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR PROGRAM COST THIS MEANS THAT EVERY NON FEDERAL DOLLARS SPENT ON ENT CAN GENERATE A DOLLAR FIFTY ENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS OR ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE ENT SERVICES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A 75% FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT. IN THIS CASE THE STATE WOULD GET A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE AN EMT SERVICES FOR EACH NON FEDERAL DOLLARS SPENT. SB SIX ZERO NINE ALSO RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF ADULT EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION BY REQUIRING THE STATE AS PERMITTED BY FEDERAL LAW TO DECKS DESIGNATE AND ROME AND THESE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. AS MEDIAN STUDENT EXEMPTION FROM SNAP WORK REQUIREMENTS. AS UNEMPLOYMENT AS UNEMPLOYMENT RATES SOAR AND THE NEED FOR SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS INCREASES IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT THE STATE MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT PREPARE ITS WORKFORCE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF LOCAL EMPLOYERS. PLUS THIS PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES TO EMPLOYERS THAT HIRE ENT RECIPIENTS. THE CALPERS ENT EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WILL DO JUST THAT. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE. THERESA BOOZE MAN WITH THE COMMUNITY ACTION PARTNERSHIP OF TULARE COUNTY. YES ALL RIGHT THE MODERATOR IF WE CAN NOW BRING ON TREES EGGMAN PLEASE. ONE MOMENT.

AND SET A LIMIT FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT SB TWO FORTY SIX THE CHILD CARE STABILIZATION FORMULA.THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A SINGLE REGIONAL LIES REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS A MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. SPECIFICALLY HAS TWO SEPARATE ONLINE SYSTEMS FOR REIMBURSING PROVIDERS THAT MEET TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS THE EXISTING BIFURCATED SYSTEM RATE RATE SYSTEM AND INADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT RATES COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO FUND AND DELIVER HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN. WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN BEING SERVED THIS ADELINE TO SYSTEM APPROACH LIMITS X. ACCESS FAIL TO MAXIMIZE PROGRAM QUALITY AND IS FORCING MANY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OUT OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE CURRENT RATE SYSTEM RESOURCE EXPENDITURE SHOULD BE STREAMLINED AND EXPANDED IN A WAY THAT ONE COMPENSATES TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS FOR THE COSTS OF PROVIDING CARE. TO A RESPONSIVE TO THE REBEKAH NAMIK DELIVERY AND DIVERSITY. OF MEANING VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS AND FOR INCENTIVIZES HIGH STANDARDS AND PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN JUST ONE AND NINE CHILDREN. ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE SERVICES HOWEVER THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED THE NEED FOR CHILD CARE AS WE SAW PROVIDERS SHUT THEIR DOORS AND THOSE THAT REMAINED OPEN OR FINANCIALLY SQUEEZED TO THE LIMIT. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS TIME TO RESTRUCTURE HOW WE REIMBURSE PROVIDERS TO ALLOW THEM TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN AND SERVE MORE CHILDREN AFTER ALL WITHOUT CHILD CARE THERE REALLY IS NO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THROUGH THESE REFORMS CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND MAXIMIZE PUBLIC BENEFIT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT THIS BILL WILL E AMENDED IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IF AND WHEN IT PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO REFLECT AT THE BASE INTRUM RATE SHOULD BE THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE UP TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN R. M. R. WHICH IS THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE.

COM LONGER HI COM LONGER I'D PAN NIGHT AND I. SO THE VOTERS FIVE ZERO AND THAT BILL IS OUT. ALL RIGHT OKAY. NOW MOVING ON TO AGENDA SEVEN SB FIVE SIX TWO BY CENTER PORTANTINO FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS- SB FIVE SIX TWO WILL ELIMINATE SIGNIFICAN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS IMPOSED BY HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH A WITH AUTISM WHO RECEIVE BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT EARLY CAN SHOW REMARKABLE PROGRESS I UNDERSTAND I THINK IT'S THREE TIMES. MMHM MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO HAVE EARLY NTERVENTION IN LATE INTERVENTION AND FOUR TIMES MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BENEFICIAL TO START EARLY SO WE'RE REALLY INCREASING THE CHANCES OF THESE YUNG PEOPLE HAVING SUCCESS IN LIFE AND REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THE BILL ALSO CODIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROFESSIONALLY PARA PROFESSIONAL. TO ENSURE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE CITY SIX TELL US THAT ONE IN FIFTY NINE CHILDREN BORN TODAY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY AS I SAID BEFORE AND HELPING THESE CHILDREN LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS CRITICAL. NOT ALL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE THE SAME THEY RESPOND TO TREATMENT DIFFERENTLY LIKE ALL CHILDREN RESPOND TO THINGS DIFFERENTLY GERMANY TREATMENT TAILORED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN. OR PSYCHOLOGIST WHO KNOWS THEM BEST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TREATMENT ALL TREATMENTS MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL CHILDREN. EIGHT YEARS AGO SB NINE FORTY SIX PASSED THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR AUTISM FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. IT HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT OTHERS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM RECEIVING ITS BENEFITS BECAUSE OF A DRAFTING ERROR AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS NOT EVERY CHILD IS RECEIVING COVERAGE FOR THE TREATMENT THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER PRESCRIBES THEM. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED COVERAGE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBE EVIDENCE BASED COVERAGE. THIS IS A COVERAGE THEY OR THEIR EMPLOYERS HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR BUT IT'S IN TOO MANY CASES THE PARENTS ARE STATE ARE LEFT TO COVER THE COSTS OF THIS CRITICAL CARE. ADDITIONALLY FOR MANY CHILDREN THERE IS A SIX TO TWELVE MONTH WAITING LIST FOR THE ONE TREATMENT THAT HEALTH INSURANCE COVERS. TREATMENT DELAYED IS TREATMENT TONIGHT IN DEVELOPING A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL CHILD TO MINE BY EXPANDING THE TYPES OF QUALIFIED ALREADY STATE CERTIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ELIGIBLE COVERAGE THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS. THIS CRITICAL SHORTAGE AND ALLOW FOR CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE TREATMENT AND CONDITION HAS PRESCRIBED THE BILL WILL ALSO ADDRESS ROADBLOCKS THE COVERAGE FOR OUR PARENTS WHO FOR REASONS OF WHY. FAMILY PRESSURES CANNOT FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR CHILD'S THERAPY SESSION OR WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE TO RECEIVE SERVICES AT OUR AFTER SCHOOL DAY CARE SETTING. THE SITUATION SHOULDN'T PRECLUDE COVERAGE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT WITH SB FIVE SIXTY TWO THEY WON'T. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JIM LANTRY FROM THE D. I. R. COALITION OF CALIFORNIAN ALISON FAN A PARENT. OF A CHILD WITH AUTISM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO- WILL BE MOVING ON TO A LEAD WITNESSES AND- IN SUPPORT. AND JUST REMINDED THE WILL BE LIMITING- AT. THE TESTIMONY TO THREE MINUTES EACH AT THE TOP PLEASE SUPPORT NUMBER ONE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. HI MY NAME IS JIM LANDRY THANK YOU MANAGER SENATORS I'M WITH C. D. R. FLOOR TIME COALITION- A COALITION OF PARENTS AND PROVIDERS TO ADVOCATE FOR CHOICE OF TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE SO THIS WILL SOUND FAMILIAR TO MANY OF US ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM DESERVE THE BEST DOCTOR OR PSYCHOLOGIST PRESCRIBED MEDICALLY NECESSARY EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT DESIGNED. SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE TREATMENT EARLY RESPOND BETTER AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE TREATMENT **** TO THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD IS IMPORTANT RESULTS IN THE CHILD ATTAINING HIS OR HER FULL POTENTIAL. YOU KNOW TO CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE LIKE WHAT WORKS FOR ONE CHILD MAY NOT WORK FOR ANOTHER. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW TREATMENT SHOULD BE AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE WHICH REQUIRES THREE THINGS FIRST THE TREATMENT HAS TO BE SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH. SECOND I MUST USE THE CLINICIANS BEST JUDGMENT AND THIRD IT MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE PATIENT. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED MENTAL HEALTH THIRTY ONE NINETEEN NINETY NINE IT IMPRESSED DISSIPATED THAT AUTISM WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS PHYSICAL ELEMENTS THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB NINE FORTY SIX WHICH MANDATED THAT ALL PRESCRIBED MEDICALLY NECESSARY EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO BE COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE. AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WHAT DID HAPPEN IS THAT HEALTH INSURANCE WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS COVERED ONE FORM OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT AB EIGHT. OTHER FORMS OF EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS WERE DENIED COVERAGE. AS A RESULT PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM PRESCRIBE A DIFFERENT FORM TO TREATMENT. WE'RE FACED WITH THREE OPTIONS. FIRST WILL TO PAY FOR THE- TREATMENT OUT OF. YOU THOUGH THERE THEIR EMPLOYER THAT ARE PAID FOR. AND MOST PARENTS. SINGLE PARENTS AND LO AND PARENTS THIS IS WAS AFFORD. THE SECOND WAS THAT REGIONAL CENTER TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT SINCE. IN SOME CASES THE SIX. ABOUT A COUNTRY TO THE LEDGE. INTENT OF GRASS NINE FORTY. THE THIRD OPTION WAS JUST ACCEPT THE ONE FORM OF THERAPY THAT WAS COVERED. EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE IDEAL OR MIGHT EVEN BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD. IT ALSO RESULTED IN A LONGER TERM CARE. BECAUSE YOU HEALTH INSURANCE CARRIER MORE MONEY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY COSTING THE CHILD TIME THAT CAN NEVER BE RECOVERED. THIS BILL WILL WRECK THAT AND FINE ACHIEVED- LEGISLATIVE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE BILL HAS BEEN FORTY. I WANT TO POINT THAT THE CORE. ARTISANS FOR. THIS BILL ADDS ARE ALREADY CLASS. AS MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS THIS IS INCLUDED IN SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE LAST YEAR. WHICH AMENDED THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT. UNDER SB FIVE SIXTY TWO THESE QUALIFIED AND SUPERVISE PROFESSIONALS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE COVER TREATMENT. AND ALLOW MORE CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THIS ESSENTIAL TREATMENT. SB FIVE SIXTY TWO ALSO INCREASES THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS REPAIR PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING NINETY BE SERVICES. OR BACKGROUND CHECKS AND CLOSES THE LOOP THAT ALLOWED IN CARE TO DO NOT COVER. THE BILL BY NUMBER ORGAN. IN PROTECT PARENTS OF IN NEED THESE ARE BASED TREATMENTS. THANK YOU VERY I'M HAPPY TO QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU I WILL BE MOVING ON TO LEAD SUPPORT NUMBER TWO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. HELLO BY NAME IS ALLISON SPAIN- AND I'M THE MOTHER OF I HAVEN'T SEEN A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM- JUST BEFORE HE TURNED TO. I MEAN I'M HAPPY BE HEARD TODAY TO SHOW MUCH.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MY NAME'S MICHELLE HYDE AND I'M BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYST- ALSO CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING SENATOR PORTANTINO AND THE SPONSOR CORRECTIVE MEETING YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OUR CONCERNS- CAL ABBOTT IS CONCERNED REGARDING THE REVISION OF DEFINITION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT. TO INCLUDE DEVELOPMENTAL AND RELATIONSHIP BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE F EFFICACY. IF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR PARTICULAR INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER IT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE EXISTING A MANDATE. THAT STATE OTHER EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. THAT IS CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT MAKING SB FIVE SIXTY TWO UNNECESSARY. AND DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR THEY INDICATE THAT SB FIVE SIX EACH YEAR DOES NOT EXPAND PROVIDER QUALIFICATION. AND THIS IS THE CASE THEN WE QUESTION THE NEED FOR THE BILL HOWEVER THE ANALYSIS INDICATES THE BILL DOES EXPAND QUALIFICATIONS WERE QUALIFIED OCCIDENT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL. WHICH IS CONCERNING. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED WITH REFERENCES TO EDUCATION AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAT EXIST IN THE BILL AS IT UNCLEAR WHAT. EDUCATION WOULD BE SINCE THERE'S NO UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE PROGRAMS OR CURSED COURSE WORK IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT. THIS IS ABOUT ENSURING HIGH QUALITY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR VULNERABLE POPULATION AND MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY. OF THE AUTISM INSURANCE MANDATE. CONTRA TO THE PER CODE. THERE IS NO AB MANAB. AT THE END NOW CORRECT LISTED NUMBER OF OTHER TREATMENT MODALITIES. THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND ARE THEREFORE COVERED BY COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION CAN AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY A STATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BODY. WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT CONCERNS RAISED BY THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT- WE DIDN'T MISS OUR- FIRST WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. FORMOSA CORTEZ'S SHE ON THE LINE.

FIVE SIX TWO. HI GOOD AFTERNOON- TERM MEMBERS REALLY SUCH AS MILLER SAYS BUT AS AN ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS AND OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MOVING ON TO THE NEXT. AND ONE MOMENT PLEASE AND THE NEXT ONE IS MELISSA CORTEZ PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTERNOON OUR MEMBERS AND SHARE AYE I APOLOGIZE FOR I THINK I HAD THE WRONG DIAL IN NUMBER- MELISSA CORTEZ A GOVERNMENTAL ADVOCATE REPRESENTING THE CENTER FOR AUTISM AND RELATED DISORDERS. CARDS PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT. CURRENT LAW ALREADY REQUIRES COMPETENT FOR COVERAGE FOR ALL EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT. I WANT TO GO BACK AND EXPLAIN WHY THE ORIGINAL MANDATE WAS DRAFTED THAT WAY. AT THAT TIME DMH THE NGO Y. HEADLINE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH SOME OF THE LARGE HEALTH PLAN. IN THOSE AGREEMENTS THE HEALTH PLANS AGREED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. AND THIS WAS ONLY AFTER LARGE VOLUMES OF THE NILE COURT ROUTINELY OVERCHARGED OR LION ARE. BUT THOSE SETTLEMENT DIDN'T COVER ALL HEALTH PLANS AND THEY REQUIRE TREATMENT BY LIKE HE'S PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN CALIFORNIA ABA PROVIDERS ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED BUT NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE. BECAUSE OF THIS SB NINE FORTY SIX DID VERY IMPORTANT THINGS. CHOIR COVERAGE BY ALL COMMERCIAL PLANS AND IT TIED PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS TO EXISTING DDS REGULATION. IS BAD ALREADY ALL DONE ALL THE WORK AND OUTLINES WHAT THOSE QUALIFICATIONS SHOULD BE. TEN YEARS AGOWHEN THAT LAW WAS BEING DEBATED THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHERE THEY'RE ASKING THAT WERE TRYING TO BE INCLUDED. AND WHILE THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. WE DO NOT WANT TO CLOSE THE DOOR TO A MERGING MENTALITIES AND THAT'S WHY THAT BILL WAS DRAFTED TO INCLUDE ALL OTHER EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THIS MEANS THAT IF AND WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH RESEARCH TO FIND AN INTERN AND INTERVENTION IT'S EVIDENCE BASED. IT IS COVERED BY LAW. THE NATIONAL AUTISM CENTER'S NATIONAL STANDARDS PROJECT LIST RELATIONSHIP BASED TREATMENT AS A MERGING IT LIST FOR TIME UNESTABLISHED. IN ADDITION A TROOPER RECORD FOR AN ALMOST IDENTICAL BILL TWO YEARS AGO SAID THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE THAT RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENTAL INTERVENTION IMPROVED COMMUNICATION ALSO ACTION ACADEMIC PLACEMENTS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ABA VERSUS FOR TIME. THIS IS ABOUT PRESERVING OF STANDARD OF CARE THAT IS BASED ON SCIENCE AND RESEARCH. MAKING THIS CHANGE COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT IF KIDS ARE MOVED INTO LESS EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. SO FOR THAT REASON WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO STRIVE TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF THE H. T. R. VOTE NO ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE- PUBLIC COMMENT ON IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WINNING Q. WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. OKAY WELL MOVING ON I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OFFER ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THREE NINE- TO- PORTANTINO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I WOULD THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T BEEN A FASCINATING THREE YEAR JOURNEY FOR ME LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE SAME MISSION SAYING ALMOST IDENTICAL THINGS WERE COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS- THIS IS ABOUT. MAKING SURE A DOCTOR CAN PRESCRIBE AN EVIDENCE BASED MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT TO HELP KIDS. THE FACT THAT IT IS GETTING SUCH OPPOSITION FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES- EMPHASIZES BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT. WHAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS ARE MAKING IT ABOUT AND I IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT KIDS WHO TALK PAST EACH OTHER. AND I JUST I'M FRUSTRATED AS A DAD. AS A LEGISLATOR AS A POLICY MAKER AND IF YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR WE- SENATOR STONE WAS BROUGHT TO TEARS THINKING ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS FAMILY HAVING TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR TREATMENT BIKINIS GRANDDAUGHTER. THIS IS ABOUT FAMILIES WHO. FIND A BENEFIT FROM THIS TREATMENT FROM MULTIPLE TREATMENTS. BUT BECAUSE OF A FLAW IN THE DRAFTING HAS CREATED A MONOPOLY. AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THE MONOPOLY. AND I JUST THINK WE NEED TO EMBRACE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY HEALTHCARE. WE NEED TO EMBRACE THE INTERVENTION OF OUR KIDS. AND WE NEED TO PASS THIS BILL AND IT NEEDS TO GET SIGNED AND WE JUST NEED TO BRING CARE. AND LOVE TO. TELL THE LITTLE ONES WHO NEEDED AS EARLY IN THEIR LIFE AS POSSIBLE AND- YESTERDAY'S CONVERSATION WAS VERY VERY PRODUCTIVE- I HOPE IT CONTINUES. BECAUSE I HEARD A LOT OF COMMON GROUND FROM THE TWO SIDES EVEN THOUGH. NONE OF THAT WAS NOT EXPRESSED TODAY- BUT I REALLY APPRECIATED THE EFFORT FROM THE CONVERSATION YESTERDAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I REALLY WANT TO GET THIS BILL SIGNED THIS YEAR. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO WE HAVE A MOTION- PRESIDENT BY CENTER CORTESE ON- SB FIVE SIX TWO AND- SECRETARY TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

MANY CHILDREN ARE FOSTER SYSTEM HOWEVER HAVE RELATIVES WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED OR HAVE A PAST CONVICTION. AND UNFORTUNATELY UNDER CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT RULES THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE TREATED PER JUDICIOUSLY. EVEN WHEN. THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD MAY BE VERY OLD YEARS PASSED FOR IT WOULD NOT IMPACT THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD AND DISBAND PREVENTS. THAT FAMILY MEMBER OR EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER FROM BEING ABLE TO BE THE CHILD CARE GIVER. NOW THERE'S A RACIAL IMPACT TO THIS WERE FIVE LENDS ENACT BLACK CHILDREN OR TWO POINT EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WHAT NEXT TO OLDER AND ARE ALL.

COME TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I WANTED TO STOP THANK SENATORS SKINNER FOR- FOR WORKING WITH WHAT ARE COMMITTEE AND WITH MEMBERS- TO DRESS YOU KNOW ANY CONCERNS OR WHAT THAT WERE RAISED DURING THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. OF THE AUTHOR KNOWS ALL ALL BE STAYING OFF THIS BILL AT THIS TIME HOWEVER I A WATER MONITOR THE BILL AS IT MOVES ALONG AND- AND- SEE IF THERE IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES BACK. I'M SURE THAT IT WILL- AND AT THIS MOMENT I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. STE SENATOR PAN AND THEN THE MISTER VICE CHAIR. OKAY MISTER BAXTER. MAKE IT YOUR OWN SEARCH HERE I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL I HAD SOME REALLY STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL- TWO WEEKS AGO- BUT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND COMING UP WITH THESE GREAT AMENDMENTS I THINK- THEY MOVE THE BILL IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION YOUR WITNESS DID A GREAT JOB- FROM CEDAR BDA YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT THE BILL AND TALK ABOUT THE PROTECTIONS FOR THE CHILDREN. WHICH I THINK WE ALL ARE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE ON THAT- YOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I WANT TO GIVE THEM A SHOUT OUT YOU CAN JUST- THE EMOTION IN THEIR VOICES AS THEY'RE TRYING TO CALL THROUGH AND- AND- TELL THEIR STORY IN THE LITTLE BIT OF TIME THAT THEY HAD TO TELL THAT STORY- I. AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE MOST. IMPORTANT AND SAFE PLACE. FOR CHILD AGO IS WITH ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER- I ALSO AGREE THAT. YOU KNOW A FIVE YEAR OLD MISTAKE OR THIRTY YEAR OLD MISTAKE DOESN'T DEFINE. THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND OR YOUR ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIBLE. I THINK SOMETIMES IT THAT STORY CAN ACTUALLY BE A POSITIVE ROLE MODEL. FOR THESE CHILDREN. TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE- WITH AN ADULT. THAT LOVES THEM AND CARES FOR THEM AND HAS HAD TO OVERCOME. SOME A NEGATIVE LIFE EXPERIENCES. SO I THINK THAT'S A POWERFUL. TOOL ADDITIONAL TOOL IT IS NOT EVEN TALKED ABOUT AND ANALYSIS. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT- AND SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I'M HOPING THAT IT HAS A- IF IT DOES BECOME LAW THAT IT HAS A POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR THESE FAMILIES. AND THAT THE STORIES WILL GET TOLD MD ARE INSPIRATIONAL ENCOURAGING TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE- YOU KNOW PART OF THIS. LIFE EXPERIENCE AND WE CAN HAVE MORE SUCCESS STORIES. THANK YOU MISTER MAESTRO MOVING ON TO SENATOR PAN AND THEN A CENTER CORTESE. THANK YOU AND- SESSION- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. WORKING WITH- THE EXTREMELY DETAILED ADVOCATES SAND THE WELFARE DIRECTORS ON THE BILL AND- AND TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE AN EXCELLENT ALSO CLARIFIED. OF COURT APPEALS A RULING WHICH IS LAW SO NOTICES FOR ANYONE WHO HAS ANY QUESTIONS THE ACTUAL LAW AND STATE RIGHT NOW. DECLARES THAT SOME OF THESE RESTRICTIONS WHICH WERE LISTING IN THIS BILL ARE ACTUALLY READY UNCONSTITUTIONAL SO THAT THEY COULD NOT THEY WOULD NOT HOLD UP ANYWAY IN COURT THAT THAT'S THE FINAL RULING RIGHT THERE'S NO FURTHER APPEAL OF THAT PARTICULAR RULING AT THE- IT WAS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS YES THE CARD IS NO ONE ELSE IS TAKING A BREAK THANK YOU. I THINK THAT IT'S- HELLO. FIRST OF ALL YOU SAY IS THAT I KNOW THAT BOTH YOU AND I- THOSE VALUE SAY THAT NOTE THIS CHILD SAFETY IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT THE MOST THE TOP CONCERN RIGHT AT THE CHILDREN'S SAFETY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CHILDREN'S SAFETY THOUGH IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. YEAH HOUSE SAFE HOME IS AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DOES AN EXPERT YOU KNOW HAVING A CRIMINAL RECORD HOW UNSAFE THAT REALLY MAKE THE HOME. AT THE END AND THE NATURE BUT ALSO THE FACT IS THAT PART OF CHILD SAFETY IS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE HOME WHERE THEY HAVE THE OPTIMAL OPPORTUNITY FOR. THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS USUALLY USUALLY IN MOST CASES A RELATIVE'S HOME SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT CONNECTION WITH THEM AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE WAY THESE AND THEN BALANCE THAT AND TO MOVE FORWARD SO. I ALWAYS DID APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS YOUR INTENT AND EVEN THE- PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THE BILL I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WORK WITH THE WELFARE DIRECTORS AS WELL TO ADDRESS THIS IN THE CHILD ADVOCATES. AND WITH WITH THOSE PARTICULAR CHANGES AND ALSO RECOGNIZING AGAIN D. WHAT THE CASE LAW IS AS WELL AND THE FACT. WE'RE TRYING TO THAT WERE. CAN I THAT CASE LAW. AS WELL. ASSEMBLY I WILL BE FAVOR OF YOUR BILL AND ALL MOVE AT THE- TIME. THANK YOU. SENATE ACCORD. YOU'RE THINKING SURE I'LL BE SUPPORTING BILL AS AMENDED- RIGHT PREACH THE INTENT OF THE BILL TREMENDOUSLY IN TERMS OF- RELATIVE PLACEMENT IN TERMS OF FAMILY PLACEMENT IMAGES SPENT TWELVE YEARS ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SO MUCH THAT TIME BUT SHARING THE SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE THERE- THE HER THERE ARE MANY MANY REASONS SO. TO KEEP GOING DOWN THIS PATH- NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS SAID. NOT OF ZERO PLACEMENT IS HAPPENING IN A LOT OF SITUATIONS- DESPITE- THE LAWS THAT THAT REQUIRE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PLACEMENT- IT IN AND- THAT'S NOT HAPPENING BUT WASN'T HAPPY TO MY HOME COUNTY IN I DON'T HAVE TO SAY TO FOLKS IN GENERAL I'M NOT THE EXPERT HELP EVEN THOUGH I DID SERVE AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME IN DEEP IMMERSION. I'M NOT HOLD MYSELF OUT AS AN EXPERT AS EXPERT AS SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TESTIFIED ON THE BILL TODAY BUT I WILL SAY- THAT. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HARM THAT CAN OCCUR TO THE CHILD. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS. ABSENT THIS POTENTIAL ROLE TO PLACEMENT- THAT'S BECAUSE COLD OUT HERE- IN IT AND I WON'T GO TO THE NEW RATE THE LIST OF THINGS THAT. I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW PLEASED- IN THE FACT TO- HOLDING CELLS FOR CHILDREN OR ARE BEING HELD BECAUSE- COUNTIES EVEN WITH. INTERCOUNTY AGREEMENTS CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THE PLACEMENT NECESSARY OR THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR THE RECORD THE FAMILIES OF. THE PROFESSIONAL FAMILIES AVAILABLE. SO I DO SEE THE INTENT PYRRHUS- EXCELLENT ACTUALLY IN. THE FACILITY SUPPORTING THE BILL THINK MANAGER. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. CORRECT THANK YOU- SENATOR SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU- DID OVER THE BREAK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE ADVOCATES YOU KNOW I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE SHARED BY MY COLLEAGUES A CRIMINAL RECORD DOES NOT NECESSARILY PREDICATED ON SAFE CONDITIONS- OR EVEN THAT IT IS AND SAFE IN SOMEONE'S HOME WHEN I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES THE FAMILY SUCCESS IS BREAKING FAMILIES UP- AND AS OFTEN AS WE ARE IN PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES LISTENING TO THE STORIES MOSTLY TOLD BY- BLACKENED BROWN FATHERS. WHO ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN- BECAUSE OF PAST BEHAVIOR- IS ONE OF THE MOST. EGREGIOUS I THINK IN TELLING SIGNS OF AN INABILITY FOR FAMILIES TO HEAL- IN CHILDREN TO HAVE A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE. AND WE HAVE REALLY DONE A DISSERVICE. TO OUR FATHERS. IN THIS CYCLE OF POVERTY AND FEAR. AND IN DOING SO WE HAVE UNDERSCORED THIS FALSEHOOD THAT THEY ARE IRREDEEMABLE. THEY ARE SO BAD THAT THEY DON'T EVEN DESERVE TO HAVE- ACCESS TO THEIR CHILDREN TO HAVE THEM PLACED IN THEIR HOME OR IN THE HOME OF ONE OF THEIR RELATIVES- AND WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD AND DISMANTLE- THOSE KINDS OF FALSEHOODS IN MISPERCEPTIONS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR HOW WE ALLOW OUR FAMILIES TO HEAL. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU- TENER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CARE AND APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S A COMMENT SANDRA YES IT DOES THE BILL WAS IMPROVED. AND I THINK WHICH- ONE IT SQUARELY PUTS THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD FIRST IT EXEMPTS A NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS A GOOD DEAL OF THEM. AND IT PUTS IT- STREAM OR DID STREAMLINED NOT THE RIGHT WORD HE CLARIFIES THE PROCESS THAT HAS TO BE GONE THROUGH FOR. THE ROSS'S FOR DETERMINING WHETHER THE PAST CONVICTION SHOULD BE APPLIED OR NOT. NOW ONE THING I WOULD RAISE SNOWED IN THE BILL AT THE MOMENT BUT- AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AT THAT LIST OF PAST CONVICTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU SEE IT LOOK AT IT IS QUITE EXTENSIVE. AND WE ARE MAKING CHANGES NOW TO SENTENCING THAT CLARIFY DIFFERENT CRIMES WE'VE% HAD IN MANY CASES IN CALIFORNIA AN OVERLY BROAD. SET OF IN THE PENAL CODE SAID OF SENSING SO IF I TAKE FELONY MURDER FOR EXAMPLE. FELONY MURDER IMPLIES THAT YOU MURDERED WE HAVE- THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WE REVISE THAT LAW SO THAT. IN ORDER TO BE CONVICTED OF FELONY MURDER. YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC ROLE OR INTENT TO KILL IT. HOWEVER THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE CONVICTED OF FELONY MURDER WITHOUT THAT MANY OF THEM NOW HAVE BEEN RESENTENCED. HAVING BEEN RESENTENCED THOUGH YOU STILL HAD THAT ORIGINAL CONVICTION. SO HOPEFULLY THIS BILL WOULD NOT. ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF A PERSON WHO IS RESENTENCED FOR EXAMPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO BE A CARE GIVER IF THEY'RE IN THE SITUATION EITHER YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO TRY TO GET THEIR CHILD BACK WERE IF THEY WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER. WAS WHATEVER A CHILD WAS REMOVED FROM THAT FAMILY MEMBER AND YOU WERE TRYING TO FIND A RELATIVE TO PUT THE CHILD IN THE PLACE- I DID NOT GO INTO THE DETAIL TO DETERMINE FOR EXAMPLE. IF THE BILL IS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY. TO HELP INSURE THAT BUT I RECENT ONLY BECAUSE- WHILE IT IS LEGITIMATE FOR US TO BE CAUTIOUS AND LEGITIMATE FOR US ALWAYS TO MAKE THE CHILDREN SAFETY FIRST. USING A LIST OF PAST CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS DOES NOT NECESSARILY INFORM US. IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CHILD SAFETY. SO I JUST RAISE IT AS FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS WE MOVE ON AND FUTURE. I THINK THE BILL IS IN GOOD SHAPE NOW AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT. AND THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON IT. AND I THINK IT WILL- GREATLY HELP US WE HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING PLACEMENT FOR THEM SO IF THIS IMPROVES THAT. THEN IT'S A GREAT STEP FORWARD. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS TYPE OF QUESTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU WITH THAT I ESCRIBO.
