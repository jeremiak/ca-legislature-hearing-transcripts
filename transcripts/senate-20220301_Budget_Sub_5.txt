GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SENATORS- IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANYTHING TO SAY WE CAN MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST FIRST ISSUE. OKAY OF THE FIRST WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR NEW SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. US SECRETARY NATALIE BLUE GI I HOPE I SAID THAT RIGHT THE SECRETARY WELCOME AND- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING. CHAIR DRAWS ON MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES FRAMING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. IT IS AN HONOR OF A LIFETIME TO BE HERE SERVING AS CALIFORNIA'S FIRST LATINO LABOR SECRETARY PARTICULARLY AT THIS CRUCIAL MOMENT IN WHICH THE STATE'S PANDEMIC RECOVERY IS TAKING PLACE ALONGSIDE OTHER SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC SHIFTS. RELATED TO CLIMATE AND HEALTH CARE. THE BUDGET THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY IS VERY INTENTIONALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THE LABOR AGENCY REMAINS WELL POSITIONED TO HELP EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS MEETING NEW DEMANDS CREATED BY THE INTERSECTION OF THESE ECONOMIC SHIFTS. BEFORE I START I WANT TO RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE WITH ME TODAY THEY ARE THE AGENCY LEADERS WHO REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO SERVE AND SUPPORT THE ENFORCEMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION ECOSYSTEM. THAT SUPPORTS OUR WORKERS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS. THEIR WORK AND THEIR DEDICATION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO THEIR GREAT AND THEIR TIRELESS WORK BOTH THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AS WELL AS WE ENTER THIS NEW STAGE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. SO THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HAVE HAD SPECIFIC IMPACTS ON THE LABOR AGENCIES WORK AND OUR MISSION AND I'D LIKE TO MENTION A FEW OF THESE IMPACTS. FIRST WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS. NEW WORKFORCE DEMANDS IN SECTORS SUCH AS HEALTH CARE AND ENERGY WHILE ALSO FACING UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES RELATED TO HIRING AND RETENTION. SECOND WHILE WE WORK TO SUPPORT SHARED VALUES AROUND CARBON NEUTRALITY AND CLIMATE JUSTICE FOR COMMUNITIES WE FACE A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS IN THIS TRANSITION IN INDUSTRIES AND TO DO SO IN A MANNER THAT PRESUMES LESS AND LISTENS MORE. THIRD AS WHICH AND WE FEEL GRATEFUL FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND PROMISING FUTURE WE MUST DO SO WHILE FOCUSING ON SOME DIFFICULT TRUTHS THAT THE PANDEMIC ON COVERED. IT IS FACT THAT PERVASIVE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INJUSTICES CONTINUE TO EXIST AND HAVE GROWN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. IT IS FACT THAT THESE INEQUITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY ADVERSELY AND DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WOMEN INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES VETERANS RURAL COMMUNITIES AND HEARTBREAKINGLY BUT OFTEN FORGOTTEN OR USE. IT IS ALSO A FACT THAT THE DISCONNECTION AND POVERTY THAT INEQUITY PERPETUATES RESULTING GROWING SOCIAL COSTS FOR EVERYONE AND LIMITS AND PLACES LIMITS ON HOW QUICKLY WE CAN RESPOND TO AND ADAPT TO THE DEMANDS OF OUR SHIFTING ECONOMY TRUTHS AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO RESHAPE AND REIMAGINE OUR STATE PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR EVOLVING ECONOMY WILL ALSO LIBERATING OURSELVES FROM THE STUBBORN AND PERVASIVE INEQUITIES. AND SPEAKING OF INEQUITY WE HEAR THIS TERM IS SO MUCH THESE DAYS IN THE MEDIA AND POLITICS AND ACADEMIA EVEN IN OUR OWN POLICY AND OPERATIONAL DISCUSSIONS. BUT THE GROSS INJUSTICES ON THE COSTS THAT INEQUITY CREATES WON'T DISAPPEAR SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO DISAPPEAR OR BECAUSE WE PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK FOR A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THEY EXIST. AT THE LABOR AGENCY WE INTO COMBAT IN EQUITY BY REMOVING SYSTEMIC BARRIERS FOR POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED FROM OUR WORKFORCE AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. BY DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO AND BEING READY TO REIMAGINE AND TAX STRATEGIES THAT CREATE BROADER SYSTEMS CHANGE AND BY PUSHING FOR SYSTEMS CHANGE WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE HARDEST TO SERVE BOTH IN OUR WORKER AND EMPLOYER SPACE IS THE KEY TO SUSTAINABLE A DOCTOR. AND MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC TRANSITION TRANSFORMATION. GROWTH AND PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE. INVEST IN THIS BUDGET AND OUR COMMITMENT TO EXECUTING THEM WITH A FOCUS ON COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. EMPOWERMENT AND INNOVATION AIMED TO DO JUST THAT MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE FUTURE ECONOMY WHILE ASO LIFTING UP THOSE DISCONNECTED FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMY. THE BUDGET ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT WE CAN'T MAKE THIS CHANGE ALONE OUR BUSINESSES ARE ENTREPRENEURS ARE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE PIONEERS OF ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS THE MARRIAGE AND REQUIRE SUPPORT TO SUCCESSFULLY MEET THE DEMANDS OF PIONEERING INTO OUR FUTURE. SO HOW DO WE GET THERE HOW DO WE SUPPORT WORKERS BUSINESS AND COMMUNITIES DURING THIS TRANSITION WELL MEETING NEW ECONOMIC DEMANDS BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND MODERNIZING THE WAY WE SERVE CALIFORNIANS. FOR THE LABOR AGENCY IT'S ABOUT INTENTIONAL INVESTMENTS AND FOCUS ON THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS. THE BUDGET THAT YOU WILL DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY IS DRIVEN BY A FEW DISTINCT PRIORITIES. FIRST THE UNDENIABLE AND PRESSING DEMANDS FOR NEW BETTER AND MOREINCLUSIVE HEALTH CARE JOBS AND PATHWAYS THAT WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED AN EQUITABLE HEALTH OUTCOMES ACROSS THE STATE. SECOND WORKFORCE STRATEGIES AND INNOVATION THAT MEETS OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN A MANNER THAT RECOGNIZES THE CHALLENGES FACED BY TRANSITIONING WORKFORCES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. THIRD A RENEWED FOCUS ON THE IMMENSE VALUE OF CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE AND THE RECOGNITION THAT CONNECTING THEM TO THE EVOLVING ECONOMY REQUIRES INCREASING ACCESS TO LANGUAGE AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING THAT MEETS BOTH THEIR PERSONAL CAREER TRAJECTORIES AND THEIR EMPLOYERS NEEDS. POOREST CONTINUE TO MONITOR MODERNIZATION OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE CLAIM ACCESS AND EXPERIENCE BOTH WHILE ENSURING LONG TERM RESILIENCE AND KEEPING OUR DOORS SHOT TO FRAUD. AND LASTLY FIFTH IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING AS A FORMER FEDERAL WORKPLACE INVESTIGATOR BUT A CONTINUED FOCUS ON PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S IN CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR WORKPLACES IS THE BASIC REQUIREMENT TO ASSURING THE INCREASE VOICE SAFETY AND DIGNITY. ALL WORKERS NEED IN ORDER TO SHAPE THEIR PERSONAL GROWTH AND MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE BROADER ECONOMY. IN CLOSING I WANT TO REITERATE HOW INNOVATIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED THIS BUDGET IS. IT INCLUDES ELEMENTS THAT ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE THE HARD WORK OF RESPONDING TO COLD IT WILL ALSO SEND YOU A MESSAGE OF HOPE ABOUT HOW WE CAN RECOVER DIFFERENTLY AND BETTER THAN WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WITH INVESTMENTS THAT FOCUS O EXPANDING OPPORTUNITY. CREATING BALK BROADER ENTRY INTO THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA'S WORK FOR SYSTEM AS IT LEADS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TOWARD A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ALL OF THE SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ALSO YOUR STAFF FOR THE TIME THAT YOU SPEND TODAY ALL OF THE WORK YOU DO OUTSIDE OF HEARINGS LIKE TODAY'S TO SHAPE POLICY. THAT SUSTAINS CHANGE AND IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. MY LEADERSHIP TEAM IS PRESENT AND READY TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS CRUCIAL AND MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN OUR WORK FORCE.

ACCORDING TO THE ALAMO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- FOR THIS INTRODUCTORY ITEM- OUR OFFICE HAS HAS NO PARTICULAR COMMENTS BUT WILL BE AVAILABLE- AND HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON SOME OF THE- STUFF FOR OTHER ITEMS ON THE AGENDA THANK YOU. THANK YOU- AND THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I BETTER TOP AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NO FURTHER COMMENT SAID THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A LONG AGENDA YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS RIGHT NOW TO START OFF COMMENTS I'M SORRY- SENATOR THE COULD. MISTER FRANCIS TO REDO THE QUORUM. OKAY I THOUGHT WE HAD TO WE HAD TO DO THAT OKAY THANK YOU SKEWS ME. SIR GROWTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS PERU GI IDEA I SIT ON THE RULES AND IT WAS MY HONOR TO CONFIRM YOU AND THEN ALSO THIS BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT. IN YOUR STATEMENT THAT YOU- THAT YOU OPENED WITH YOU TALKED ABOUT THE URGENT LABOR SOURCE SHORTAGES AND ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. YOU TALKED ABOUT- NEW AND CHANGING- WORK FORCES IN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND- SOME OTHER THINGS- I HAVE A QUESTION ON. THE TO IT HE'S- WHEN YOU SAID THAT IT MADE ME THINK OF OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY THAT WERE THERE DURING THE PANDEMIC IN THE IN AT TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WERE SERVING EVERY DAY ON THE FRONT LINE SAVING LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS- WHO CAME TO THE HOSPITAL WITH COATED. AND THEN THIS YEAR AND THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR VACCINE FREEDOM ISSUES- THERE'S APPROXIMATELY STILL ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN TERMINATED TWO THOUSAND FROM JUST LOS ANGELES AREA KAISER SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED FROM THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN DONE THE LIST GOES ON- WE'RE TERMINATING NURSES THAT HAVE WORKED FOR OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME YEARS AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT WERE FRONTLINE HEROES. I'M JUST TWO YEARS AGO AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INVESTING IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND TO RECRUIT AND BRING IN THE SAME SKILLED INDIVIDUALS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH CARE. CAN YOU GIVEME AN EXPLANATION ON WHY THAT SOMETHING THAT'S- THAT'S TAKING PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. PERCENT ARE THANK YOU AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN AS WELL- I FEEL LIKE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS- I EAT I I'D LIKE TO SEE A FEW THINGS- THE SHORTAGES THAT WE- ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS IN THIS BUDGET GOAL WAY BEYOND- THESE IMMEDIATE SHORTAGES THAT YOU ARE NOTING DO DETERMINATIONS THAT OF COURSE THE LABOR AGENCY- DOES NOT OVERSEE-YOU KNOW THAT WHAT EMPLOYERS HAVE POLICIES- AND IF THEY ARE LAYING OFF BECAUSE EMPLOYEES DON'T NEED TO THOSE STANDARDS. THAT IS THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE PLAY INTO HOWEVER I DO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE SHORTAGES WERE TALKING ABOUT GO WAY BEYOND WHAT IS HAPPENING CURRENTLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBED THE EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IN FACT OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS HERE AND ACROSS MANY STATES IN THE COUNTRY WERE SO STRETCHED THEN. WERE SO STRESSED OUT OUR BY THE LEVELS OF INDIVIDUALS COMING IN WITH COLD AND DYING- AND OFTENTIMES THEY WERE COMING TO WORK SICK AS WELL. AND SO ALL OF THAT TO ME AND THAT YOU KNOW THE THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF- BRINGING WORKERS FROM OUT OF STATE TO FILL SOME OF THESE CRITICAL ROLES AND THIS WAS DURING AN EMERGENCY. THIS DOESN'T EVEN COVER ALL OF THE GAPS AND SHORTAGES THAT WE HAVE HEALTH. IN COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS THE TECHNICIANS THAT THE GAPS ARE PERVASIVE THE SHORTAGES ARE PERVASIVE AND I THINK WHAT YOU DESCRIBE IS A SYMPTOM. OF WHAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR SEVERAL DECADES NOW AND SO THIS THIS BUDGET IS VERY INTENTIONALLY ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS. AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR THE STATE'S WHICH IS THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AND IF WE DO NOT INVEST PROPERLY IN GETTING PEOPLE TRAINED AND EMPLOYED IN THESE JOBS- WE PUT THE ENTIRE. SYSTEM AT RISK NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF HEALTH OUTCOMES BUT EVEN THE ECONOMIC DRIVER PIECE OF THIS. I AGREE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE YOU KNOW THE ASKS FOR ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE INNOVATIVE AND ACCESSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE RECRUIT TRAIN AND ADVANCE. INCLUSIVE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE- I UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT I JUST SAID I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAD IT A GAP AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CALL YOU KNOW THE- THE AMOUNT OF PERSONAL THAT WE NEED TO WIN THE PANDEMIC KIT THAT WAS ALL EVIDENT TO ALL OF US IN OUR DISTRICTS- I DO UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT WE BROUGHT IN OUTSIDE- NURSES FROM DIFFERENT. STATES AND WE ACTUALLY RAN THEM THROUGH A I DON'T AS A TEMPORARY STAFFING BUT WHATEVER THEY CALL IT FOR THE NURSING INDUSTRY FOR STAFFING AGENCIES. OR THE AGENCIES WERE PAID FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR CHARGE THAT TO THE HOSPITAL'S FIFTY. AM NURSES THEMSELVES GOT EIGHTY DOLLARS AN HOUR SO CREATED A LARGE REVENUE SOURCE. FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT. THAT CATER TO THAT SPECIFIC THAT TALENT I GUESS- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FUNDING FOR ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM AND- THE ISSUE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON. IS YOU KNOW THE ROUGHLY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS THAT ARE LAID OFF THAT WERE CONSIDERED. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC GOING TO WORK IN TAKING CARE OF SICK PATIENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NOW THEY HAD TO CHOOSE. TO EITHER KEEP THEIR JOB AS A NURSE FOR TWO I HAD JUST TEXTED NURSE IN THAT ORKS FOR KAISER SHE WORKED THERE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. AND BECAUSE SHE REFUSED TO BE VACCINATED AFTER SHE WORKED IN THE- THE- RESPIRATORY AREA FOR COVERT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF- SHE WAS TERMINATED- SO THAT'S AN ASSET SOMEBODY'S ALREADY TRAIN SHE'S LATINA SHE'S GOT FIVE KIDS SHE'S. JUST AN INCREDIBLE PERSON AND WE HAVE A WOMAN WHOSE FAMILY IMMIGRATED HERE FROM MEXICO WHEN SHE HE'S TERMINATED. SHE REFUSED TO GET VACCINATED AND SHE'S A INCREDIBLE ASSET TO OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. OKAY ANYMORE QUESTIONS CENTER NO THANK YOU OKAY- THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS- WE WILL MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO- ACTUALLY ISSUES TO THE FORE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ISSUE TWO WHICH IS HIERO TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- I. WOULD LIKE TO THE- HIS DEVELOPMENT BOARD WHO WILL BE SPEAKING ON THAT I'M PRESENTING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS TIM RAINY CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- I'M I'M NOT SURE BUT I THINK POSSIBLY AT LEAST NAY WITH LABOR AGENCY WAS GOING TO PROVIDE A SLIGHT OPENING FOR CONTEXT OR- OR MAYBE I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. GREAT THANK SEVENTY AND IS PART OF ISSUE ONE. SO I AM AT LEAST NAY DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR THE FUTURE OF WORK AT THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY WHEN I WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR DRAW SO AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. FOR BY CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES TODAY AS SECRETARY PALU GI- MENTIONED ACROSS THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY WORKFORCE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE THREE MAJOR CROSS CUTTING INITIATIVES. PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THAT HAVE SPECIFIC PROGRAM INVESTMENTS IN EATING IS WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN GREATER DETAIL IN THIS MORNING'S HEARING. AS A VERY BROAD OVERVIEW THESE THREE INITIATIVES INVEST IN HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY. CLIMATE AND GREEN ENERGY WORKFORCE IN COLLABORATION WITH CAL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION WITH NATURAL RESOURCES AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AND IMMIGRANT ECONOMIC MOBILITY INITIATIVE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE GOVERNOR SENIOR ADVISER ON IMMIGRATION. WITH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST A FEW MINUTES ON THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE INITIATIVE AND AS OUR SECRETARY MENTIONED THIS BUDGET INCLUDES A ONE TIME ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. OVER THREE YEARS AND HEALTH CARE ECONOMY AND HEALTHCARE ECONOMIES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE MORE INNOVATIVE AND ACCESSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES TO RECRUIT TRAIN HIGHER AND ADVANCED AN ETHNICALLY AND CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE WITH IMPROVE DIVERSITY. BETTER WAGES AND BETTER HEALTH EQUITY OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL BE JOINTLY COORDINATED. BY THE LABOR AGENCY AND HELPING SERVICES AND INITIATIVE INCLUDES TWELVE PROGRAMS THREE DIRECTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE WORK FORCE DEVELOPED BY THE LABOR AGENCY. THE H. R. T. P. WHICH TENANT WILL DESCRIBE HEALTH CARE WORKER ENHANCEMENT- THROUGH EIGHTEEN P. AND EM TREAT ANSWER EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN TRAINING AT THE WORK FORCE SERVICES BRANCH. AND AS OUR SECRETARY ALLUDED TO THE PANDEMIC SERVED AS A GREAT ON MASTER IN EQUITY'S ACROSS OUR STATE INCLUDING THOSE IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE. AND WHILE PROBLEMATIC AREAS IN HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE HAD BEEN GROWING AND SHORTAGES IDENTIFIED EVEN BEFORE THE CRISIS BUT PANDEMIC EXACERBATED THESE WHAT WE SEE NOW ARE MANY HEALTH CARE ENTITY STRUGGLING HOSPITALS ARE SHORT STAFFED AND DESPERATE AND PAYING VERY HIGH REGISTRY RATES FOR TEMPORARY WORK FORCE. HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER HUMAN SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE DESPERATE FOR CASE MANAGERS AND OUTREACH TEAM MEMBERS WITH IMPACTS ON SERVICES TO CHILDREN PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND OTHER. SOCIAL SERVE. AND OVER ARCHING PROBLEM EVEN WHEN STAFFING CHALLENGES MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT LESS SIGNIFICANT IS THE LACK OF REPRESENTATION AND DIVERSITY IN THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. IN RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN L. G. B. T. Q. STATUS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WITH A VARIETY OF LIVED EXPERIENCE. WE ALSO SEE THAT CURRENT TRAINING PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ADULT SCHOOLS THE CSU AND UC PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY IMPACTED AND CANNOT PRODUCE THE VOLUME OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS. NEEDED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE WORKERS PROJECTED TO RETIRE OR WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE OF CARBON AND DISTRESSED. OR TO MEET THE GROWING HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF A RAPIDLY AGING POPULATION. AS INVESTMENT WILL CREATE AN INNOVATIVE AND ACCESSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN AND RECRUIT HIRE IN ADVANCE AND ETHNICALLY AND CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE. AND WILL ALSO BUILD LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY ACROSS THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECTORS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR ACROSS CALIFORNIA. EDIE'S LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION PROJECTS JUST UNDER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION HEALTHCARE AND HUMAN SERVICE JOB OPENINGS FROM. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT WITH WAGES AVERAGING JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. WE'VE IDENTIFIED TWENTY THREE OCCUPATIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL CLUSTERS IN THESE PROJECTIONS THAT WILL DO NOT REQUIRE FOUR YEAR DEGREES AND OFFER MORE ACCESSIBLE PATHWAYS INTO FAMILY SUSTAINING JOBS AND HOSPITAL. PRIMARY CARE AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS. THESE INCLUDE HEALTH TECH ROLE SUCH AS EKG. ULTRASOUND TECHS RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS FOR BOTTOM MISSED AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WHO SERVICES WILL SOON BE COVERED BY MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS. HELLO CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IS REQUESTING FOR OUR OWN USE TWO POSITIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN ANNUAL GENERAL FUND- FINDING OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THIS WORK FORCE FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FOR THIS NEW LEVER LEVEL OF COORDINATION THE LABOR AGENCY REQUIRES AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OUR RESEARCH DATA SPECIALIST AND FUNDING FOR TEMPORARY STAFFING AND CONSULTATION TO PLAN AND EXECUTE THIS INITIATIVE AND TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINABLE COLLABORATION WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND THEN BRIEFLY SECRETARY POLLUTE CHEN MENTIONED ANOTHER OVER ARCHING AN INITIATIVE ACROSS THE LABOR AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS. WILL HELP THE STATE TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CREATE ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THE BUDGET DIRECTS INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES AND CREATE HIGH QUALITY JOBS BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THE CHAP CHALLENGES FACING WORKERS IN INDUSTRIES MOST AFFECTED BY THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. AND THEN LASTLY THE IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE INITIATIVE ENVISIONS A TRUE CALIFORNIA THAT TAPS THE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE NEW IMMIGRANTS AND CREATES PATHWAYS OUT OF POVERTY FOR IMMIGRANTS TRAPPED IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT. AND ENVISIONS A COORDINATED STATE EFFORT ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS OF SKILLS TRAINING AND SUPPORTS THAT CREATE ACCESS TO THE U. S. LABOR MARKET FOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS AT ALL EDUCATIONAL LEVELS FROM INTERNATIONALLY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS TO PEOPLE WITH MORE LIMITED EDUCATION WHO NEED CAREER PATHWAYS INTO LIVING WAGE JOBS. WE ALSO ENVISION A SYSTEMS CHANGE APPROACH THAT REMOVES BARRIERS TO LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENS ACCESS TO SKILLS TRAINING EXPANDS EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT ACCELERATE LEARNING FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND ENGAGES EMPLOYERS IN BUILDING THE SKILLS OF THEIR WORKERS TO BUILD THEIR COMPETITIVENESS INCLUDING DIGITAL SKILLS. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR TO PASS THE BATON BACK ON TO MY COLLEAGUE. TIM RAINY AT THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAY- I KNOW YOU WERE GIVING THE BROAD OVER VIEW OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES- BUT BASS THE REASON WE HE ALSO MENTIONED IS A VERY SPECIFIC ITEM OF THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS REQUESTING. OF FOR THE ROLE OF THE LABOR AGENCY AN ARM. IN THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT YOU KNOW IN WITH REGARDS TO THE HEALTHY OF CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE SO THAT'S THE SPECIFIC ITEM. IN ISSUE ONE- AND THEY WERE GONNA BREAK IT DOWN EVEN MORE- WITH REGARDS TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AGENCY AND BOARD- WITH REGARDS TO THE OVERALL OVERVIEW ANY. ISSUES HERE WE'RE GOING TO BREAK DOWN AGAIN INTO MORE SPECIFICS. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION- ON THE OVERVIEW ORDER WE GONNA BREAK IT DOWN LIKE I HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PROGRAM AND THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS SPENT LAST YEAR. IN THE DATA THAT SAYS THAT SUPPORTIVE OF- YOU KNOW HOW MANY JOBS ARE CREATED OUT OF THAT WHAT WITH THE WAGES OF THOSE JOBS THOSE THINGS AND- ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE OIL INDUSTRY OBVIOUSLY REPRESENTING 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL SO DO YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT NOW. OR DO YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT LATER AND AS WELL IF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO COMPETITOR- SENATOR I- WE HAVE SPECIFIC ISSUES THE ONLY ISSUE IN. THE ISSUE AN ITEM- ISSUE ONE IS SPECIFICALLY THE REQUEST FOR TWO POSITIONS- THE OFF FROM THE GENERAL FUND- SO WE ARE MOVING WE CAN MOVE ON NOW SPECIFICALLY THE ISSUE TO WHICH HIGH ROAD THE HIGHROAD PARTNERSHIPS- CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY TO ISSUED TWO THROUGH FOUR ARE ARE MORE SPECIFIC. OKAY YOU CAN I JUST WANT THE OPPORTUNITY ASK THIS QUESTION SURE THANK YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER. CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED ALL RIGHT THEN WE WILL MOVE ON- MISTER RANEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO- DIVE INTO A TO. S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OUT TOO MANY CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. THE FISH THE FIVE PROPOSED INITIATIVES INSIDE ISSUES TWO THREE AND FOUR ALL WALK THROUGH THOSE ALL OF THESE BUILD INTO THE HIGH ROAD WORK OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- THE HEALTHCARE HIGH ROAD- THE THREE INITIATIVES WITHIN THE CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY- BUCKET AND THEN THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM THE LANGUAGE JUSTICE PATHWAY- SO QUICKLY THE HYBRID VISION IS TO MOVE BEYOND. A WORKFORCE APPROACH OF JUST MAKING MORE PEOPLE COMPETITIVE FOR TOO FEW GOOD JOBS- AND IT PRIORITIZES EQUITY JOB QUALITY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE- IN THE PREMISE IS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE EQUITY WITHOUT PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO JO QUALITY OF THOSE THINGS ARE INEXTRICABLY CERTAINLY ONCE WE TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC EQUITY I IN THAT CONTEXT. RAIN GAME IS TO INCREASE ECONOMIC EQUITY BY TRANSFORMING THE WAY THE WHOLE SECTORS RECRUIT HIRE PROMOTE RETAIN ALEX THIS IS VERY INDUSTRY BASED WORKER CENTERED WORK- THE END GAME IS TO END UP WITH A CALIFORNIA CAN BE DEFINED BY QUALITY JOBS EQUITY IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE GOAL THIS OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP. OR HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CREWS PROGRAM BOTH ACTUALLY IN EACH MAJOR SECTOR IN EVERY CORNER OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S VERY LONG GAME STUFF- SO JUMP RIGHT INTO THE ISSUES- MANAGER IF THAT'S OKAY YES PLEASE SO THE ISSUE TO HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- DEPUTY SECRETARY STATE SPACE AT. THE CONTEXT FOR THIS. ARTIST LARGER INITIATIVE FOR CARE WE'RE YEARS FOR THE HEALTH CARE HIGH ROAD. AGAIN THIS IS INDUSTRY FOCUSED WORK TARGETING OCCUPATIONS THAT DON'T REQUIRE FOUR YEAR DEGREES BUT LARGELY IN THE ALLIED HEALTH- EVERYTHING BY DOCTORS AND NURSES ESSENTIALLY- MEDICAL ASSISTANTS RESPIRATORY TECHNICIANS SURGICAL TECHNICIANS. AND OTHER OCCUPATIONS- WE'RE GONNA TRAIN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE- THE DATA SHOW AS A DEPUTY SECRETARY STATE POINTED OUT. TWO MILLION- AT ALLIED HEALTH OPENINGS. BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OPENINGS FOR JUST MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ALONE- SO HUGE DEMANDS- WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST TO FEEL THAT THE GAPS- BUT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO- ISSUE THREE CLIMATE. AND CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY THOSE THREE ITEMS THE FIRST IS A WELL CAPPING- WORKFORCE PILOT WERE REQUESTING FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING. AGAIN INDUSTRY BASED PARTNERSHIP WORK- WITH ORGANIZED LABOR- INDUSTRY. EMPLOYERS SCHOOLS COLLEGES. WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN ACROSS FIFTY HUNDRED WORKERS IN KERN KERN COUNTY- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION WHICH IS. ALSO REQUESTING IN THEIR IN THEIR- THERE IN THIS BUDGET TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO PLUG ORPHANED OIL AND GAS WELLS- THAT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER OVER TWO YEARS. EACH OF TWO YEARS THE OIL CAPPING WORK REQUIRES SKILLS THAT ARE COMMON ALREADY IN SEVERAL OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES- AND IS ESPECIALLY ALIGNED WITH OIL AND GAS DRILLING. SO OUR INTENTION IS TO TRANSITION. CURRENT AS WELL AS DISLOCATED WORKERS TO OIL WELL CAPPING MORE BY BUILDING NEW SKILLS TRAINING IN EXISTING STATE APPROVED JOINT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT SIR KERN COUNTY- ARE HYDRO CONSTRUCTION CREWS INITIATIVE IN KERN COUNTY WHICH TARGETS. WORKERS FROM DISADVANTAGED GROUPS FOR PATHWAYS TO CAREERS IN CONSTRUCTION- WILL BE ALLIED WITH THIS IS A PATHWAY AND IS A PIPELINE AND- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO WORK WITH- EDT SORT FOR SERVICES BRANCH- BUT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER- IN IN THIS HEARING. BOB FOR BY TO WORK OR TO IDENTIFY DISPLACING OIL AND GAS WORKERS INTERESTED IN DOING WELL CAPPING WORK. A MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ITEM- UNDER UNDER CLIMATE THE LOW CARBON ECONOMY PROGRAM WE'RE REQUESTING SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE YEARS. BUILDING ON A HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND HIRING CONSTRUCTION CREWS THAT WERE PLANNING TO. TRAIN APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED WORKERS- THE THIRD ITEM- IN THIS BUCKET THE PORT TRAINING CAMPUS. WERE REQUESTING- HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. THE TOTAL COST OF THAT TRAINING CAMPUS AT THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH IS A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS CAN BE PICKED UP BY THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH. THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORT COMPLEX AS AS YOU WELL KNOW- MADAM CHAIR- HANDLES MORE CONTAINERS PER SHIP CALL THAN ANY OTHER PORT COMPLEX IN THE WORLD- YET IT DOESN'T HAVE A CENTRALIZED LOCATION FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING. THERE IS LIMITED TRAINING AVAILABLE. ON PORT PROPERTY FOR LONG CHAU WORKERS AND NONE FOR TRUCK DRIVE. AWAY TRAINING THAT IS HAPPENING. FOR I'LL DOUBLE L. SHORT SPEECH. ALL ACROSS. DIFFERENT PARCELS OF LAND- BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A SPECIALIZED TRAINING FACILITY SO THAT. IN DUE TO THE CURRENT LIMITED CAPACITY LONG FOR TRAINING IS SUFFER DELAYS. AND BOTTLENECKS AND- AS WE ALL KNOW WELL- THE CHALLENGES OF PORT REQUIRED. TRAINING AND ALSO REQUIRES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN HOW WE DO THAT TRAINING. AT THAT AT THE PORT COMPLEX. THE LA AND LONG BEACH PORTS HAVE SET ASIDE A FIFTEEN ACRE SITE FOR THE TRAINING CENTER- THE CENTER IS GOING TO FOCUS ON EXPANDING OF BASHING TRAINING THAT WE STARTED WITH- WITHOUT THE LA PORT A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT'S HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WITH I'LL W. CIVIC MARITIME ASSOCIATION AN EMPLOYER SUPPORT. LASHING TRAINING WILL MOVED THIS PORT AT THIS- THIS TRAINING SITE- THIS THIS TRAINING FACILITY- SHIP TO SHORE TRAINED AT CRANE OPERATOR TRAINING- WHICH CURRENTLY CAN HAVE- CAN ONLY HAPPEN. ON CRANES THAT ARE SITTING IN BUSY TERMINALS- SO WHEN THEY'RE TRAINED CRANES ARE BEING USED WE CAN DO TRAINING ON ON THOSE CRANES FOR A LONG FOR WORKERS WHO WANT TO BECOME A CRANE OPERATORS HUGE. WHICH IS IN HUGE DEMAND- AND DO THAT NOW BECAUSE OF ALL THE STRANGER BEING OBVIOUSLY UTILIZED YEAH AND EVEN IN THE PAST. THOSE TERMINALS ARE QUITE BUSY IN THERE IF THEY'RE NOT SAFE PLACES TO DO TRAINING- ZERO EMISSION CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT TRAINING FOR WORKERS TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE. MAINTAIN AND REPAIR EQUIPMENT THAT DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE INDUSTRY'S LOW EMISSIONS TRANSITION IN GOALS FOR REDUCING CARBON AT THE PARK- AND THEN MAINTENANCE REPAIR OF THAT THAT ZERO EMISSION EQUITY THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE HANDLED. AT THIS NEW TRAINING SITE RATHER THAN SCATTERED ACROSS THE PORT COMPLEX BOB OUR INTENT. BIGGER PICTURE IS THE IMPACT THE REGION IN THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN- BY PROVIDING SPACE FOR OTHER HIGH ROAD EMPLOYER SEEKING TO TRAIN THEIR WORK. ENTREE TO QUITMAN INCLUDING TRUCKS AND FORKLIFTS- AND FINALLY. THE ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA YOUTH. PROGRAM LANGUAGE JUSTICE- THE- WORK FOR SOME REPORTERS WERE. TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS. TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN AT RISK YOUTH WHO WISH TO GO INTO NONPROFIT WORK. IN DRIVEN TOO MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY'RE DOING SUCH SOCIAL JUSTICE WORK. YOUTH PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING THROUGH SEVERAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND YOU EARN AND LEARN WITH NONPROFIT SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY THOSE PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES- BACK AND IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS- SERVICES SO. THIS IS A VERY NEW PROGRAM WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL HERE IT'S IT IT'S ALREADY- BEEN INVESTED IN IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LITTLE WHILE IT'S A NATIONAL. EFFORT THE LABOR MORE FOR SOME AGENCIES HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THIS AND SO THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY EXPAND THIS WORK ACROSS CALIFORNIA- STUDENTS- WELL IT I SHOULD GO BACK A SECOND SAY THAT AND THAT'S WHY IT IS VERY EXCITING WE NEED MORE ADVOCATES AND LEGAL AND LANGUAGE SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS- BUT THE SAME TIME THIS CREATES GREAT PATHWAYS FOR CAREERS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE A PASSION FOR THIS KIND OF WORK- SO IT BRINGS US TO- REALLY IMPORTANT- THINGS TOGETHER THE STUDENTS ARE GONNA RECEIVED INCOME AND OTHER SUPPORT AND MENTORING WEILAND AND ROLLED THE OUTCOMES WILL BE PAID INTERNSHIPS WITH THESE TO ME BASED ORGANIZATIONS AT LEAST A MINIMUM FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR ALAMO- FINANCE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT. I BETTER TOP AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MANAGER WE HAVE NO NOTHING TO ADD TO- TIM'S COMMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU BYE I JUST WANT OPEN UP- TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ON I'D ISSUE TOO. YES SIR GROWTH QUESTION HERE AND I'M NOT SURE I APOLOGIZE I DON'T KNOW WHO WILL ANSWER THIS QUESTION- BUT LAST YEAR WE ALLOCATED- ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HYBRID TRAINING PROGRAM IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY AND THIS YEAR THEY'RE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION OR SKIS ME TWENTY MILLION- PER YEARS- ON THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED LAST YEAR CAN YOU TELL ME HOW IT WAS MEASURED AND HOW MANY NEW HIGH ROAD TRAINING JOBS THAT CREATED MISSPOKE- IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET- THERE WAS A HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL ALLOCATED FOR HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS. EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO DEVELOP THAT NEW AND EXPAND EXISTING HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS IN THIS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH JIMMY COLLEGES I TO THE DEVELOP HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP SO TOTAL A HUNDRED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND THOSE DOLLARS HAVEN'T GONE OUT YET THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF. OF WE'RE DEVELOPING A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS NAY WILL BE OUT NEXT MONTH. SO I HAD IS I AM NOT TWENTY FIVE MILLION IT'S A HUNDRED MILLION THAT MONEY HASN'T GONE OUT YET WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS PROGRAM WORKS AND WE'RE GONNA ALLOCATE ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION IS THAT THAT. IS THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND- MINE MISSING SOMETHING. WE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN INVESTING AS MR ALAM OF A POINTED OUT IN HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS FOR SOMETIME- BEGINNING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- WE USE- FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT FUNDS. WE'VE INVESTED- PROP BATH THAT- THIRTY NINE FUNDING ALSO IN HIGH REGISTRATION CAREERS- SO WE DO HAVE. AN EVALUATION DEVELOP BY THAT UCLA- THAT THAT- AND I CAN SHARE THAT EVALUATION TO WORK WITH YOU SO IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE WORK. A LOT OF THE FOCUS IS ON BUILDING INDUSTRY BASED PARTNERSHIPS- AND THEN WE ALSO TRACK PARTICIPANTS- AND OUTCOMES FOR PARTICIPANTS SOME OF THOSE ARE YEAH INCOME WORKERS ALREADY EMPLOYED PEOPLE. WHO GET RETRAINED AND MOVE UP- AND A LOT OF THAT WORK IS ALSO BRINGING. IN NEW HIRES. THWAITES FOR NEW HIRES. INTO SO AT WORK ON SO IT'S KIND OF A SKILLING BACKFILL- PAST. I'M BUT AS I SAID SHE VERY INTO BASED THAT A LOT. EMPLOY ORGANIZED LABOR WHEN THEY REPRESENT THE WORKERS BUT ALSO THE TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE SYSTEM KIND OF CONNECTING THAT TO PATHWAYS TO GOOD QUALITY JOBS SO WE HAVE A VALUATION- WORK. UP ON OUR WEBSITE AND I AS I SAID I CAN ASSURE THAT YOU WE ALSO HAVE AN EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR THE ON GOING INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE INVESTMENTS HAVE HAVE REALLY. SCALED UP OVER THE LAST SINCE THE LAST BUDGET. THE FRAMEWORK IS IN DEVELOPMENT WITH UCLA- AS WELL. YOU THE GENERAL NUMBER JUST A GENERAL ESTIMATE TO YOUR BEST GUESS OF HOW MANY JOBS NEW JOBS THAT THAT PROGRAM FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HAS CREATED FOR INDIVIDUALS. THAT NEED THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR PEOPLE WHEN LOW DE SOCIO ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITIES. AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A SUCH A GREAT WORK HISTORY SECOND CANCERS- DO YOU HAVE. YOUR BEST GUESS THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE GOT THAT JOB OR GOT THOSE JOBS JUST TO ESTIMATE pAS I SAID- AND- WE CAN I CAN COME BACK WITH YOU TO YOU WITH WITH A MORE DETAIL ON KIND OF HOW THE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK WORKS. BUT IN THE PAST INVESTMENTS- WELL I SHOULD I SHOULD BACK UP AND SAY- WELL IN THE PAST INVESTMENTS WE TRAINED ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND. WORKERS AND THAT WAS A COMBINATION OF UP SCALING BACK FEELING ON OUR HIGHER CONSTRUCTION CAREERS ABOUT- INITIATIVES. OUT WITH THAT PROP THIRTY NINE FUNDING THAT WAS THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS INVESTED STARTING pFEW YEARS IT'S OVER THREE YEARS- THANK THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN ENERGY JOBS ACT WAS A PARK THIRTY NINE THAT- PULLED SOME MONEY FOR. THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD. TO START THAT THAT HIGH RECONSTRUCTION CHRIS PROGRAMS WE TRAINED TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED WORKERS- SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT- FINISHED WHAT WE CALL AN MC THREE CERTIFICATE WHICH IS INTRIGUED BY YOUR CERTIFICATE IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. ABOUT STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP- BUT 41% CONSTRUCTION ENERGY EFFICIENCY RELATED EMPLOYMENT ABOUT TWENTY THREE PERCENT- A LOT WERE PUT THAT PLACE IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION ABOUT 10% OF THAT THAT THAT GROUP OF TRAINEES- SO THAT. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF PEOPLE SERVED I WISH I HAD THOSE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME SENATOR ALL RIGHT I'D BE- I'D BE. GOING TO THAT LIST OF PRIMARILY- PEOPLE OF COLOR IT'S ALL FOCUS ON LOW INCOME WORKERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- SO PEOPLE OF COLOR- THE PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE OF. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES NEEDS TO COME UP IT'S QUITE GOOD IN SOME OF THE CRAFTS WE GENERALLY NEED TO COME UP SO THE COHORTS FOR THAT HIGH RISK INSTRUCTION CAREERS. ARE LARGELY ABOUT PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN- WHO ARE ALSO. UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES- THEY REPRESENT BETWEEN TEN AND 15% OF MOST OF OUR COURTS IN SOME CASES TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. SO THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT WE SEE IN OUR COHORTS THAT ARE GETTING PLACED IN IN. STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO- THAT INITIATIVES- LOW EXACTLY WE WALK OVERTIME SO THAT THAT'S THE- PUSHER. THANK YOU I CAN GET YOU MORE DETAIL ON SATURDAY DON'T THAT. IN FRONT OF ME I APPRECIATE IF YOU GIVE THAT DEEP THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. RESPONSE WAS- ADEQUATE VERY ADEQUATE SITE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M FOR THAT. I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT I HEARD CORRECTLY YOU SAID THAT. IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES INDUSTRY CONSTRUCTION TRADES WHERE WE'RE INVESTING SOME OF THESE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO. ADD A MAKING MORE DIVERSE CONSTRUCTION TRADES INDUSTRY. YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES IT'S AS LOW AS 10% FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR SOMETIMES FIFTEEN. AND IN VERY RARE CASES 25% IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD ME JUST NOW. OR NOT. I THINK I SAID THAT FIRST FOR WOMEN IN THE- TRADES I'M NOT SURE THAT IF I GIVE YOU A PERCENTAGE FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS EXACTLY IN THE TRADE BUT WHAT I DID SAY. IS IN GENERAL- PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE TRADES AND AROUND BUT IN SOME CRACKS IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES THEY'RE OVER REPRESENTED. IN TERMS OF THE SHARE THE POP OF THE POPULATION. OKAY THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH. BUT I CAN GET YOU- SPECIFIC STATISTICS ON THAT SENATOR NO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COLLEAGUES MANY. QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO- I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM. MISTER RANEY HOW WORK- WHAT DO YOU EXPECTATIONS FOR THE KINDS OF JOBS AND BENEFITS THAT BOB PARTICIPANTS ARE OF THE HIGH ROAD OUR TRAINING BOB PARTNERSHIPS WOULD RECEIVE AFTER COMPLETION WHAT WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION. LOOKING FOR- AND YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU MEASURE THE SUCCESS FOR THE FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- THE- IT FOCUSES ON- ON EQUITY AND JOB QUALITY- SO THE OUTCOMES OF THE INTENTION IS TO PLACE PEOPLE IN FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES ARE FAMILY SUSTAINING JOBS WITH GOOD WAGES- THAT OFTEN WELL THE SHOULD OFFER FAMILY BENEFITS- WE ALSO LOOK AT JOB QUALITY STANDARDS AROUND- SCHEDULING SCHEDULING- WORKER VOICE ON THE JOB- WORKER AB- AGENCY ON THE JOB THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB TRAINING TO MOVE UP- INCOME ABILITY SO WE LOOK AT ALL THESE. METRICS IN DETERMINING JOB QUALITY AB SO JOHN QUALITIES TO FOCUS THAN EQUITIES THE OTHER I'M SO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS ACTUALLY TARGET POPULATIONS- THAT ARE THAT WORKERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THE IDEA IS TO BUILD THE PIPELINE INTO WHERE THE BEST. ALL OF THE JOB ARE SIDE MAYBE SHOULD TALK. VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT HOW STRATEGY IS DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY WE TRADITIONALLY DO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THE HIGHROAD PARTNERSHIPS START WITH INDUSTRY A BILL- DEEP RELATIONSHIPS WITH- MULTIPLE COMPANIES WITHIN AN INDUSTRY SECTOR- AND WE FOCUS A LOT ON TRAINING AND UPSKILLING THE CURRENT WORK FORCE. AS A WAY OF BUILDING PIPELINES INTO GOOD QUALITY JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED GOOD QUALITY JOBS THE TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE APPROACH- WHILE THEY STILL NEEDED IN A LOT OF WAYS- DOESN'T DO THAT KIND OF INDUSTRY BASS WORK. WE PROVIDE. TRAINING AND WHERE WITH OFFER PEOPLE. CAN PUSH HIM OUT AND LABOR MARKETS TO HELP THE ATTACHED TO A JOB- SO THIS IS REALLY KIND OF CONNECTING THAT SUPPLY AND DEMAND THE SUPPLY OF WORKERS. AND THE DEMAND FOR WORKERS ON THE ON THE SIDE OF A GOOD QUALITY JOBS- WE DO HAVE A FOR A FRAMEWORK. THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. M. FOR ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS FOR HIGH RIGHT ACROSS ALL THE PROGRAMS ITS STATE WORKFORCE BOARD- THAT LOOKS AT THAT THE- WE CAN MEASURE AGAINST THE GOALS OF HIGHROAD ECONOMIC EQUITY WORK INVOICING OR POWER QUALITY JOBS. WAGES FAMILY BENEFITS SCHEDULING- INCOME SECURITY THOSE THINGS. BUT ALSO PARTNERSHIP. INDUSTRY. SHARES AND WE WERE WORKING WITH YOU SEE I AS I SAID BEFORE THE LABOR CENTERS OF A THIRD PARTY EVALUATOR- I'M SORRY CENTER I MIGHT BE GOING TO TOO DEEP INTO THIS- THE DATA WE'RE COLLECTING IS. IS BOTH A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE THE QUANTITATIVE SIDE IS USING OUR OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS CAL JOBS FOR EXAMPLE TO COLLECT- PARTICIPANT LEVEL DATA DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION- THE KINDS OF SERVICES PEOPLE READ RECEIVING. THAT TYPE THING- THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA IS RACE RACE ETHNICITY GENDER. AGE LOW INCOME STATUS FORMERLY INCARCERATED JUSTICE INVOLVED STATUS. VETERAN STATUS IN MOVING THESE POPULATIONS AND INTO GOOD QUALITY JOBS. THANK YOU MYSTERY OF. IT I AM JUST TO WORK A QUESTION- HOW DOES THIS FIT HOW DOES THIS HIERO TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS- FIT INTO THE ARM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- PROPOSAL THAT'S BEING MADE- THE CARE ECONOMY WORKFORCE PACKAGE. IF YOU COULD GIVE A SHORTER ANSWER BUT YOU KNOW- YEAH I ENJOY LISTENING TO ALL OF YOU BUT WE'VE WE'VE GOT A TIME ISSUE HERE BUT HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THIS I WROTE BECAUSE IT I COULD SEE FROM THE CHART. THAT IT'S IN THE IN THERE BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW IT. EXACTLY CONNECTS OF YOU CAN GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU EXPECT THAT THIS WOULD. BE INTEGRATED. SURE YEAH IT'S IT IS UNIQUE IT'S- IT'S COMPLIMENTARY TO THE BROADER PACKAGE- BUT IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT'S- LIKE ALL THE HIGHROAD OF PROGRAMMING THAT WE DO IT'S VERY INDUSTRY SECTOR BASED SO IT'S WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS DIRECTLY- AND THEN BUILDING PATHWAYS IN INTO INTO JOBS AND HEALTH CARE SO. THE PUSH IS GOING TO BE REAL STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH- PROVIDERS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS COMMITTEE CLINICS HOSPITALS- PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEM AND THE PATHWAYS INTO IT TO THOSE JOBS THAT ARE OPEN THIS ALLIED HEALTH. JOB SO THAT'S THE UNIQUE PART OF IT IS THEINDUSTRY BASED NATURE OF THE HIGH ROAD. THANK YOU AND THE LAST QUESTION IS. AND MAYBE YOU'LL ANSWER IT OR SOMEONE ELSE IS. EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS THAT GOING TO BE FORMALIZED IN TRAILER OR BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT INITIATE SENATOR WE ACTUALLY HAVE- THE HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS BUILT INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE- AS WELL AS- DEFINITIONS FOR HIGH AT THREE THIRTY P. AND HIRING CONSTRUCTION. WORKERS AND ALSO- BUILT INTO THE CODE ARE THOSE KINDS OF OUTCOMES THAT I THAT I DISCUSSED- SO THEN THE METRICS FOR MEASURING THE HIRING TRAINING PROGRAMS IS ALREADY BUILT INTO THE INTO THE COAT. THANK THANK WE DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HISTORY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON HERE QUESTION JUST TO CONFIRM MAN ON THAT QUICKLY THE HEALTH ON THE HEALTH AND MISTER RAINY YOU SAID THOSE JOBS ARE GOING TO PAY MINIMUM FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR CORRECT. YES FOUR THAT WITH THE ONE. NOT FOR ALL THE HEALTHCARE JOBS THAT GEN. HEALTH CARE OCCUPY. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TARGETING PRETTY MUCH MUCH HIGHER WAGES AND PROVIDE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. WELL BUT FOR THE LIGHT FOR THE LANGUAGE PROJECT YET MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS NOW THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT OR IN LEARN- PAID INTERNSHIP INITIATIVES. THANK YOU SIR FOR CLARIFYING. THAT WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO- ISSUE THREE WHICH IS CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY- YOU ALREADY MADE A PRESENTATION. ON THAT MISTER RANEY RIGHT. I DID I THINK THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS- THAT OTHERS MIGHT- COLLEAGUES IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS- ARE HANDLING- THERE'S MORE ON THE. I'M SORRY YES I KNOW LA BUT NOBODY ELSE FROM THE WORKFORCE BOARD.

AS A PIECE OF THE BROADER SUPPLY CHAIN PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS PUT FORTH- HELLO BRIEF COMMENTS I- PERSON FOR IT'S A CLEAR FROM FROM. MR RAINEY'S COMMENTS THAT- THE KEY BOTTLENECK AS IDENTIFIED BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALL A LACK OF. PHYSICAL SPACE FOR TRAINING- WE POINT OUT THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO DIRECT ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT OTHER POTENTIAL BOTTLENECKS TERE ARE- IF IT THE CASE THAT THIS IS THE EXCLUSIVE. CONCERN REGARDING. ADEQUATE WORKFORCE SUPPLY AT AT THE PORTS OR OTHER OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON THAT THAT MIGHT MERIT STATE ATTENTION AS WELL- THAT WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT A WITH OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE. H. R. T. P. FOR INSTANCE THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED- THE STATE SETS SOME STANDARDS FOR A- WHO WILL BE. ELIGIBLE TO ENROLL IN TRAINING PROGRAMS AND- IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT SIMILAR STANDARDS- WOULD BE APPLIED FOR TRAINING THAT TAKES PLACE THE CAMPUS. AND MAYBE TO MEMORIALIZE THOSE STANDARDS IN TRAILER BILL OR OR. BUDGET BELT- THIS. BECAME IS A IS A FOR. STRUCKAND SO IN MY- ON. SORT OF A NEW IN.

ONGOING TRAINING COST FACILITY MAINTENANCE AND THE LIKE I'M SORT OF LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE AFTER THIS ASSET IS DEVELOPED AND GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE STATE'S.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ALAMO. DEPARTMENT FOR.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ARAMBULA BONTA QUESTIONS HERE FROM OUR COMMITTEE. I JUST LIKE TO START WITH ONE- HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION VIEW. OF THESE PROPOSALS ON CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. IN RELATION TO THE TRANSPORTATION PACKAGES. ARE BECAUSE IN THE TRANSPORTATION PACKAGES WE- ALSO INCLUDE A- ZERO. EMISSION VEHICLE- EFFORTS PORT INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR RESILIENCE- AND JUST OVERALL OF. ENORMOUS INVESTMENT THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM HOW HOW DO YOU- HOW DO THEY WORK TOGETHER OR DO THEY WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU SENATOR THEY DO THEY DO WORK TOGETHER- THE BIG THAT PASSED HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS IN CURRENT HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS TO FOCUS A GREAT DEAL ON THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF- WE'VE ELECTRIC BUS MANUFACTURING LOS ANGELES FOR INSTANCE ARE TERRA- IN B. Y. D- PUBLIC TRANSIT. WE'RE EXPANDING FROM. EIGHT UP PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES THE COURSE OF COURSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS- FOR. THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES YOUR EMISSION BUSES- FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND THE OPERATIONS OF THOSE BUSES- WE ARE WORKING ENERGY STORAGE STORAGE AND MICROGRID AS A HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WITH IDW INDICA- CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. WITH HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS IN SACRAMENTO WHAT'S WITH THE SACRAMENT IN MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT THE CALIFORNIA MOBILITY CENTER- SO THEY ARE DURING NUMBER OF PROJECTS ALREADY IN TRANSPORTATION- AND WILL BE EXPANDING THAT.

YEAH WE'RE WRITING THERE WITH THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION WORK CLOSE WITH THE AGENT WERE VERY CLOSE WITH CALTRANS- TO ALIGN OUR WORK AND BE SURE THAT THEIR INVESTMENTS AS THEY CREATE JOBS WE'RE CREATING ACCESSING AND PATHWAYS TO THOSE GOOD QUALITY JOBS. THANK YOU MISTER RAINY- MEMBERS. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER RANEY I APPRECIATE- THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE- I HAVE QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT- OBVIOUSLY THE OIL INDUSTRY WERE KERN COUNTY PRODUCES 70% OF THE STATE'S REDO AN OIL 53% THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SO WE ARE THE ENERGY HAVE OF THIS STATE- IN ON THE BACKLOG. OR THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES- LET'S I GUESS I HAVE THOSE QUESTIONS AS WELL. DO YOU THINK- WHAT'S YOUR SOLUTION TO THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY WERE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN NUMBERS OF TRUCKERS LOST THEIR JOBS DUE TO AB FIVE IN DON'T TRANSPORT IN CALIFORNIA ANYMORE- DO YOU THINK THAT HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN- PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. YEAH I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING A STUDY ON ON. TRUCK DRIVING IN IN CALIFORNIA- WITH YOU THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND USED UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA TO. UNPACK WHAT'S HAPPENING A TRUCKING IN CALIFORNIA I DO THINK THAT- ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCHERS THE BOTH THE IMPACT OF DEREGULATION AND POSSIBLY EIGHTY FIVE. I HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF- CHURNING AT INDUSTRY NOW TRUCK DRIVERS DON'T SEEM. TO BE STICKING AS TRUCK DRIVERS VERY LONG- AND THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSES- DAHLE WHO TOOK CHOSEN NOT TO DRIVE TRUCKS. I'M SORRY THERE'S A THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PIPELINE INTO TRACKING- THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE JOB QUALITY AND OUT FOR TRUCK DRIVERS. OUT TO TRY TO EXPLAIN AND SOLVE FOR- THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO A NOT STICKING TO TRUCK DRIVING SO WORK. WORK THAT REPORT STUDIES CAN BE DONE IN DECEMBER. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT. INVOLVED WORKFORCE- THAT WILL. HELP INFORM HOW WE HOW WE UNDERSTAND. HOW WE ADDRESS THE STATE SECTOR. THANK YOU THAT'S GOOD NEW TO HEAR YOU VERY FOR THAT INFORMATION I PREACH I APPRECIATE THAT- SO JUST A FEW FACTS AND DATA AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. CALIFORNIA PRODUCES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL TODAY 1100% OF THOSE GIRLS PRODUCED ARE. AT IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONSUMED BY CALIFORNIANS. BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY CONSUME AS CALIFORNIANS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS A DAY ACROSS THE STATE- WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE OIL INDUSTRY ARE SECOND CHANCELLOR'S MEANING THEY'VE BEEN FORMER- FORMER INCARCERATED FELONS SERVE TIME IN PRISON GOT OUT IN THE MADE A WAY FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND STATE OUT OF PRISON AND REDUCED RECIDIVISM. THE AVERAGE WAGE IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IS A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WITH BENEFITS- I WORK I HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THIS INDUSTRY- BUT THE MINIMUM WAGE WHEN YOU GO OUT TO THE OIL INDUSTRY IS TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR REALLY I THINK IS WHAT THE IT'S GOING TO WIN THE NEW REPORT COMES OUT. AS IT'S HARD FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE WOULD TRANSITION OFF OF THIS EVEN THOUGH THERE'S RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET TO TAKE THESE- FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS OUT OF THIS INDUSTRY AND PUT THEM IN A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRAIN THEM FOR CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT INDUSTRIES THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT RETRAINING THESE WORKERS TO GO IN AND WHEN THEY MAKE. THOSE WAGES AND THE INFORMATION THAT I JUST PROVIDED TO YOU WHAT WHAT INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE EQUAL TO OR EXCEED THE WAGES OF THE BENEFITS AND- BUT THAT WE WOULD HAVE IN THIS INDUSTRY FOR THESE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS SPECIFICALLY THE ONES THAT MOSTLY WORK IN MY DISTRICT. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE THAT'S THERE'S A ROOF REALLY IMPORTANT STATISTICS. I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY HERE- WITH THE CAPPING OF THE ORPHAN OIL WELLS IS TREMENDOUS- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE IN CONSTRUCTION. AND FORTUNATELY WE'VE GOT INVESTMENTS FROM THE STATE BUT ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DRIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES FOR OTHER GOOD. PAYING JOBS- AS WE BUILD STUFF THAT CREATES DEMAND FOR WORKERS THAT WE HAVE OUR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS I RECONSTRUCTION CHRIS GRADING PIPELINES IN THE STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP. SO AS NEW APPRENTICES. ARE IN DEMAND WE CAN WE CAN FILL THOSE SLOTS- IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE'S MATTER FACT HIRING CONSTRUCTION CREWS PROGRAM IN KERN COUNTY BUT WE HAVEN'T EVERY. EVERY COUNTY OF CALIFORNIA. THE INTERESTING AND I THINK HUGE OPPORTUNITY HERE IS IN KERN COUNTY ALONE THERE FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND. OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION WORKERS- THIS ACCORDING TO LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION ET. KERN HAS A HIGH CONTENT YOU KNOW A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF THOSE WORKERS WITH EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS. SO ACCORDING TO THE CONSERVATION DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION SPEECH BC PETER FIVE THOUSAND- ORPHAN. DESERTED POTENTIALLY DESERTED WELLS- IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE INVESTING. PROPOSED. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL. GO TO IT CAPPING THOSE WELLS- BUT THIS HOUSING LEVERAGE FOR FUN AUTHOR BY THE- INVEST AND JOBS ACT. SO IT'S GOING TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTED IN THIS WHILE CAPPING WORK- IT'LL CREATE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND. JOBS TOTAL DIRECT INDIRECT AND INDUCED AND AS YOU POINT OUT THESE ARE HIGHLY SKILLED AND WELL COMPENSATED WORKERS WITH- GREAT WAGES SO OUR INTENTION IS TO. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE JOBS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEIR SKILL SETS ARE ARE VERY WELL ALIGNED- WITH THOSE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR THE OIL WELL CAPPING- SO AS WE DO THAT MORE MORE THAT WORKS MORE THOSE WILL. MORE THOSE WORKERS ARE GONNA GET ARE GOING TO BE. EMPLOYED BUT IT'S ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW APPRENTICES THAT WILL THAT WILL BE ABLE TO. MOVE PEOPLE WHO EITHER DISLOCATED OR AT RISK OF TO SECURE FROM THEIR JOBS. MOVING TO THE SHOPS BUT YOU YOU LOOK AT THAT PLUS. THE OFFSHORE- WIND INVESTMENTS- THE LIFTING INVALID INVESTMENTS THE EXPANSION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL- THE BUILDING AND BUILDINGS THE RETROFITTING OF BUILDINGS ALL OF THAT WORK IS CREATING DEMAND. FOR MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO GO INTO CONSTRUCTION BUT THERE'S ALSO A MULTIPLIER EFFECTS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THAT ARE JUST IN THE IN THE METROPOLITAN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS BUT ALSO IN THE RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. SO BUILDING STUFF IS CREATING JOBS AND WE'RE CREATING ACCESS TO THOSE JOBS AND THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE GOOD PAYING FAMILY SUSTAINING. JOBS BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR. THANK YOU- ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE. A CALIFORNIA IMPORTS. ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A DAY- CALIFORNIA IS THE NUMBER ONE. NUMBER ONE STATE. AT THE PURCHASES ECUADORIAN OIL F. WE ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA PURCHASE FIFTY ONE PERCENT. OF ALL OIL PRODUCED IN ECUADOR- THERE WAS A RECENT FORCE MAJEURE IN THE STATE OR THE COUNTRY OF ECUADOR BECAUSE INDIGENOUS INDIANS. THAT WON A LAWSUIT REGARDING- AS THE DEMOLISH OF THE RAIN FOREST THE AMAZON RAINFOREST FOR OIL TRIANGLES THAT ARE THERE. IF THAT LAWSUIT GOES THROUGH IN THOSE INDIGENOUS INDIANS WHERE WE'RE TEARING DOWN THEIR RAINFORESTS TO GET OIL TO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE OUR CONSUMPTION HASN'T GONE DOWN. WHAT'S THE BACKUP PLAN- FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THAT 51% OF THE OIL THAT WE GET FROM ECUADOR. IS THERE A DIZZY ADMINISTRATION HAVE A BACKUP PLAN BECAUSE OF THAT WILL CEASE TO EXIST. BECAUSE OF THE LAWSUIT THESE INDIGENOUS INDIANS HAVE AGAINST THE STATE THE COUNTRY ECUADOR IF THAT LAWSUIT- GOES THROUGH AND THEY WENT ON THE SECOND LEVEL. A CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE RECEIVING THAT OIL AND WE PURCHASED 1% OF DEMAND OF THE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IMPORTED BARRELS OF OIL EVERY DAY ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE WHAT'S TE ADMINISTRATION'S BACKUP PLAN FOR THAT IF THAT TAKES PLACE. THE U. S. CENTER GROVE HOW IS THAT SPECIFIC AND WE REALLY NEED SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO THESE ISSUES I THINK IT'S REGARDING IS ABOUT NINETEEN ISSUE I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SUPPLY CHAIN. PRODUCTS ARE HIRING PEOPLE SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INTERNATIONAL HOW DO WE HOW DOES THAT. HAVE TO DO WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN HERE AS FAR AS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT POLITIC COUNTY WILL BE WANT TO TAKE A STAB AT A BILITY. LET ME PLEASE GIVE A SHORT ANSWER TO THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR I I'M NOT SURE THAT I HAVE AN ANSWER TO IT BUT I I'D LOVE TO- TO VISIT SENATOR GROSS VEGGIE CENTER TALK TO YOUR STAFF AND CUT KIND OF THING TO THE WORKFORCE- ANGLES ON THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU I'D I'D LIKE THAT WE COULD SET UP A MEETING I'D REALLY LIKE THAT. I'M ON THE WORK FORCE PIECE AS WELL. AND YOU MENTIONED THAT- THERE'S FIVE THOUSAND WELLS. OUT ROUGHLY FIVE THOUSAND ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS THAT NEED TO BE CAPPED. AND WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION PEOPLE THAT. MAKE M. HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. BENEFITS MOST OF THEM HAVE COMPANY VEHICLES- ALL OF THE STUFF WE'RE GONNA TRANSITION THEM. OFF AS AT AN INCIDENT JOB THAT THEY WOULD HAVE FOR CAREER SOME OF THE WORK IN THE WHEN YOU SEE THIRTY THIRTY FIVE. FORTY YEARS- HOW MANY WELLS ARE CAPPED EVERY YEAR JUST A. CURIOSITY DOES ANYBODY HAVE THAT ANSWER. I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET IT AS WELL HAVE AN ANSWER BUT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION- PROBABLY DOES HAVE AN ANSWER. SO LET'S JUST SAY IT'S A THOUSAND WELLS A YEAR WHICH I DON'T THINK IT IS I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE HUNDREDS- ONCE THOSE WHEELS ARE CAPPED WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THOSE WORKERS. BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING THEMSELVES OUT OF A JOB. IF WE PRODUCE OIL HERE THEY KEEP THEIR JOB AND THEIR BENEFITS. AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AGAIN 55% PEOPLE OF COLOR. 38% SECOND CHANCE SERVICE MILITARY VETERAN. OF THE IF THEY CAP THESE WELLS WHERE THEY GO AFTER THAT. THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION I IT THE BEAUTY OF THAT OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES- IS THE DISPATCH MODEL- AND AS WORKERS I MEAN IT'S A VERY VOLATILE INDUSTRY- WHERE WORKERS. GO TO WORK ON A PROJECT- THE PROJECTS OVER THEY GO BACK TO THE HIRING ON THEIR DISPATCH OF THE WORK SO- THE INTENTION HERE WITH WELL WELL CAPPING IS TO BUILD IT INTO EXISTING. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT SERVES KERN COUNTY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE'LL BE DOING THIS WHILE CAPPING. SO I THINK THAT INTERESTINGLY THAT THAT THE OLDEST MODEL FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- PROBABLY IN HISTORY IS THE MOST RELEVANT ONE FOR TODAY AND THE CAN THE KINDS OF- CHANGE THAT WORD THAT WE'RE FACING. SO DO THOSE JOBS COMING OUT OF CONTRACTS FROM CAL JIM. WOOD WAS DAVID OVERSEE DOT. THE KALENJIN CORRECT I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT OKAY IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES HAVE THIS SKILL SET I MEAN I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S ONLY TWO COMPANIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT CAN PROVIDE THIS SERVICE- OF OIL WELL CAPPING A WE RECENTLY WORKED WITH. CAL JAM IN ONE OF THESE COMPANIES. THE END OF FIVE MINUTES AGO WE'RE- THE IT WAS THE OIL WELL THERE ARE THAT WAS CAP. SO LONG AGO. ANY REGULATE PROCESSES WERE IN PLACE. IT ENDED UP BEING LIKE THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE COST AND I MEAN THEY FOUND LAWN CHAIRS. LIKE METAL LAWN CHAIRS AND ALL KINDS OF JUST CRAZY THINGS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS WELL. IS THERE- IS VERY- APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM. THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT IS THERE THAT IS ACTUALLY. TRAINING THESE INDIVIDUALS TO DO THIS JOB- BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ONLY TWO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT DO THIS AND IF AND IF THAT'S TRUE. AS WHO DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM AND IS THAT HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR SOMEBODY TO GET THAT. TRAINING IS IT SIX MONTHS IS IT TWO YEARS WHAT'S THE PROCESS. YEAH THERE ARE THERE ARE. CONSTRUCTION CRAFTS THAT DO VERY SIMILAR WORK WITH OIL DRILLING- THAT WOULD BE. A VERY THAT. I'M VERY CLOSE TO THE WELL CAPPING WORK- THAT'S BEING CALLED FOR HERE SO IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF BUILDING A DIGITAL SKILLS INTO THE EXISTING APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM SO YOU USE UP SKILLED THREE LEVEL WORKERS BUT YOU'RE ALSO. BUILT INTO THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ADDITIONAL SKILLS FOR NEW APPRENTICES COMING THROUGH- THERE THERE ARE. AS YOU SEE I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT MY OF EXPERTISE- THAT INDUSTRY WORKFORCE PERSON- BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE. COMPANIES THAT DO THIS WORK BUT ALSO A LOT OF SUBCONTRACTORS THERE A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO WORK- AT THAT POINT. ON WELL WELL CAPPING. OKAY CAN I OPEN UP LEADERSHIP PROGRAM. LANGUAGES JUSTICE PATHWAY- YOU ALREADY PRESENTED RIGHT MISTER RAINY SO WILL LAST ALEJO TO COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR PLEASE. HELLO THE ONLY A WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH ISSUES FOR OKAY- FINANCE ANY COMMENTS. AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM TO FINANCE A NO FURTHER COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL. OKAY. A MISTER MISTER RANEY ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. OF WHAT TYPES OF JOBS AND BENEFITS ARE DUE THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECT FOR PARTICIPANTS TO GO THROUGH THIS ARE THESE ARE- ARE TO LEARN OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO GO TO WORK FOR MISSION DRIVEN CAN BE BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE HUGE BUDGETS BUT WORK IN THIS AREA OF- THAT IT LANGUAGE AN IMMIGRANT RIGHTS- SO WITH THE INTENTION HERE IS FIFTEEN DOLLARS HOUR MINIMUM FOR THOSE THAT. OUT A TOTAL OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE STUDENTS TO DO THIS THIS- THIS ART AND LEARN OPPORTUNITY A LOT OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE GOING IN TO THIS WORK- WE EXPECT WILL STAY WITH THOSE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OF THE WORKING WITH FOR LONGER TERM CAREERS- IT ENDS OR WILL BE PART OF A NETWORK OF JIMMY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE STATE SO IT OPENS UP OTHER ACTORS FOR CAREERS. WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE STUDENTS WILL WILL CONTINUE IN THEIR EDUCATION PATHWAYS AND GO INTO TO LEGAL SERVICES BECOME LAWYERS- THAT KIND OF THING SO- THERE THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES I THINK FOR CONNECTING THE STUDENTS THAT ARE SO PASSIONATE FOR THIS WORK- TO THIS INITIATIVE. IT HAS HUGE POTENTIAL. ABBY STEAK JUMP ANY TIME BECAUSE SHE- SHE'S ALSO KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS THIS PROJECT- AND JUST ONE MORE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF EACH OF THE PARTNERS- YOU'VE LISTED THEM HERE. OF WHAT THE TO THE PARTNERS BRING TO THE TABLE FOR THIS. FOR THIS PROGRAM. ACTUALLY COULD BE A GREAT PLACE FOR IT FOR ABBY DEPUTY SECRETARY SLATED TO JUMP IN OKAYTHERE THERE THERE ARE THREE THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS- MEMBERS OF THIS% PARTNERSHIP- AND YOU'LL GO AHEAD I DON'T TO TAKE SIR I'M HAPPY TO DO IT AS TO MENTION THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH LEADERSHIP CORPS IS ACTUALLY PART OF A- NATIONAL. NETWORK OF LEADERSHIP CORE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH LEADERSHIP CORPS ITSELF WAS SET UP TO- DESIGN AND DELIVER THIS PROGRAM IN IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT REALLY IS A UNIQUE COLLABORATION THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE INVOLVED CHEN MENTIONED THE SELECTED COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEIR ROLE IN THE COLLABORATION IS CHIU ONLINE CLASSES AND- CAREER PATHWAYS WITHOUT WORK THAT THE STUDENTS WILL BE DOING AN IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES ANOTHER SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS. AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE IN THIS IS SO IMPORTANT WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES AS PART OF THAT BEAUTY OF THIS PROGRAM IS ITS ABILITY TO CALL AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHO AREN'T YET IN COLLEGE WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE LANGUAGE JUSTICE. AND GET THEM INVOLVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND SO THERE ARE NONE REALLY ROBUST WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES FROM ACADEMIC SUPPORT ON REFERRALS FOR HOUSING AND FOOD ASSISTANCE AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. YOUNG PEOPLE NEED SO THAT THEY CAN STAY IN SCHOOL AND BE SUCCESSFUL AND THEN THE ROLES OF DARK COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL JOBS HIGH QUALITY SUPERVISION MENTORING SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN SEEING THEIR FUTURES- REALLY PROVIDING SERVICES TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THE YOUTH LEADERSHIP CORPS- THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH LEADERSHIP CORPS PROGRAMS- DOES THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT IT DOES- AT A COACHING SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE SOMEONE BUT THAT- PROJECTS AND COMMUNITIES AND- AS YOU CAN SEE THE SPONSOR THE AND CITY CALLED WHICH WILL BE THE MAIN THAT ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION ADEQUATELY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS ON ISSUE FOR ANYONE.

IT'S NOT COMMITTEE ORDER I THESE ARE. AS ORGANIZATION ARE SERVING THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION- LANGUAGE SERVICES IT IS A BIG DEAL- LEGAL WORKING WITH STUDENTS TO REALLY HAVE A PASSION AGAINST FOR GOING INTO A INTO NONPROFIT WORK INTO GOING GOING INTO IS THAT WHAT WE SEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS- SO YEAH MAYBE THAT. COVERED OR NOT IT ABBY CAN CHIME IN YEAH THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT THEY WILL ALSO BE GETTING MENTORING THROUGH THE COLLEGES.AND CAREER ADVISING AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT TO- AS I MENTIONED SO IT REALLY IS A- VERY UN WELL COORDINATED- PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. SO FOR INSTANCE THE OIL TECH ACADEMY AND IN TAFT CALIFORNIA WHICH IS- IN ITS AT TAFT COLLEGE.

IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN APPLY FOR SOME OF THESE RESOURCES OR IS THIS JUST FOR- I'D I'D I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WORD THAT DEMOCRAT CAUSES I'M JUST. I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WORD AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE PARTISAN ABOUT IT I REALLY DON'T I JUST I JUST. I LOOKED UP RIGHT NOW THE EMERALD CITY ORGANIZATION.

INTEGRATION AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY. PACKAGE AND- WITH THE GOAL OF TRAINING STUDENTS EXPLICITLY IN LEGAL SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ON AND SO THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THIS- SPECIFIC PROPOSAL HONEST TEN MENTIONED.

TO ISSUES FIVE TO SEVEN. AND THIS IS WITH REGARDS TO THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- I WANT TO WELCOME THE EDT DIRECTOR NANCY FARI AS- TO PROVIDE THE ARE COMMITTEE WITH SOME COMMENTS AND UPDATES- AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE SPECIFIC. ISSUES DIRECTOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY TO UPDATE YOU ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PROGRESS MADE OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND EDIE DATE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS NANCY VARIOUS I AM THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT SH AND WITH ME TODAY IS MY TEAM TO HELP RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. AND WHILE I AM EVER SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS AMAZING TEAM WITH ME TODAY I WOULD BE REMISS IN NOT ACKNOWLEDGING AND THANKING THE STAFF WHO ARE NOT. THOSE WHO ARE DOING THE WORK THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT CALLUM CALIFORNIANS THOSE IN THE CALL CENTER THOSE PULLING AND ANALYZING DATA SO WE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. AND THE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES ARE DEDICATED TO HELPING PEOPLE NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITY THAT CAN BE EDT. ESPECIALLY AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. I THANK THEM FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA. I'M GONNA JUMP RIGHT IN AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE AT EDT. IN RESPONSE TO RISING NUMBERS OF CLAIMANTS WAITING FOR BENEFITS EARLY LAST YEAR WE LAUNCHED A NEW PAY NOW PROGRAMS. THAT EXPEDITED AT THAT TIME APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PAYMENTS. THESE CLAIMS WERE PAID IMMEDIATELY AS EDT CONTINUED ITS WORK TO VERIFY ELIGIBILITY. WHILE THESE CLAIMANTS ARE NO LONGER WAITING FOR PAYMENT THE DEPARTMENTS WORK TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY REMAINS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMANTS STILL REQUIRE AN INTERVIEW TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY. EVEN IF THEY ALREADY RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS. TO BETTER MANAGE THE PROCESSING OF THOSE CLAIMS WE BOOSTED BENDER STAFFING AND NO SMALL PART THANKS TO THIS COMMITTEE LED BY CHAIR TORONTO OF CURSE. LAST YEAR AND CROSS TRAINED MORE STAFF TO HANDLE COMMON ISSUES REQUIRING INTERVIEWS AND CONTINUED TO SHED STAFF TOWARD CLAIM DETERMINATION WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A WRITTEN QUESTIONNAIRE IN LIEU OF PHONE CALL INTERVIEWS TO MORE QUICKLY GATHER ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION IN ORDR TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AND MUCH LESS TIME. MEANWHILE AS I'M SURE YOU HAVE SEEN IN TO FEND OFF AGGRESSIVE FRAUD ATTEMPTS FROM THOSE WHO ATTACKED STATE. UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OUR EXPANDED PROTECTION MEASURES INCLUDING THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE VOIGTS BEFORE YOU TODAY. BLOCKS OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION AND FRAUD ATTEMPTS AND TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE FRAUD PREVENTION CONTRACTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSIST US IN PAYING CLAIMS TIMELY WHILE CONTINUING TO PREVENT SCAMMERS FROM INFILTRATING OUR SYSTEMS ON THE FRONT END. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE MANY CONCERNS OF THIS COMMITTEE REGARDING THE OVER PAYMENT PROCESS AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE RECEIVED PAYMENTS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN DURING THE PANDEMIC. YOUR CONCERNS ARE ALSO MY CONCERNS AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS. CURRENTLY WE ARE NOT ESTABLISHING OVER PAYMENTS FOR FEDERAL BENEFITS AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE WORKFORCE AGENCIES ARE NOT SLUSH CONTINUES TO LEAD DISCUSSIONS ON THIS TOPIC WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND CONGRESS. WE SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT CLAIMANTS WHO ARE NON FRAUD NON FAULT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GET A BLANKET WAIVER THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AGREED AND ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE REGARDING BLANKET WAIVERS AND YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN'T TO BE FLEXIBLE. FOR THIS NON pUPDATE ON OUR FRAUD PREVENTION MEASURES IS THE PROGRESS OF FORMER U. S. ATTORNEY MCGREGOR SCOTT WHO EDT HIRED AS FRAUD SPECIAL COUNSEL LAST YEAR. I CAN PERSONALLY SAY THAT GREG IS TEAM HAVE HAD A VAST IMPACT AND PARSING TO THE SUSPECTED FRAUD OF TWENTY TWENTY. ONE OF GREG'S MOST HELPFUL ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAS BEEN INTO SUFFOCATING ACCESS TO EVIDENCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS WAS ONE OF EDIE'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FEDERAL STATE. AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HELP GET THE DATA TO THEM QUICKLY WHEN IT WAS NEEDED. NOW INSTEAD OF A LENGTHY SUBPOENA PROCESSING GRANT HAS HELPED TO FACILITATE AN MO YOU PROCESS WHICH EDT AUTOMATED AND LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW HAS IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE DATA FOR THE CASES THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING. WELL CLEARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS STILL IN THE INVESTIGATION STAGE FOR MANY OF THESE FRAUD CASES GREG WORKS WITH ID ME THOMSON REUTERS AND ACCENTURE TO LEVERAGE THE FRAUD ANALYTICS NEEDED TO PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE DATA AND EVIDENCE BUT THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES. SO THEY CAN MOVE INTO THE NEXT COUPLE OF STAGES WHICH IS OF COURSE PROSECUTION AND RESTITUTION DDD. THE RECESSION CAUSED BY KOBE NINETEEN FOLLOWED NOHISTORICAL PATTERN AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY. UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE FROM RECORD LOWS OF THREE POINT 9% TO SIXTEEN POINT 4% IN TWO MONTHS THE FASTEST RISE EVER RECORDED. EVERY STATE HAS HAD TO RETHINK WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY KNEW ABOUT RECESSION PLANNING. UNDER SB THREE NINETY BY SENATE EARLIER IN THE DAY CRAFTED A VERY FEDERAL PLAN TO BETTER PREPARE FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES AND ECONOMIC ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. I KNEW PLAN INCLUDES CAREFUL MONITORING OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND RIGOROUS WORKLOAD FORECASTING TIED TO STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS. WE ARE ALSO ANALYZING JOB DUTY CLASSIFICATIONS TO ENSURE STAFF ARE DEPLOYED AND AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. FINALLY EDT WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS THAT HELP CUSTOMERS AVOID THE NEED TO SPEAK WITH EDT STAFF IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR RECESSION PLAN IS DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DAY AND WE ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL BRIEFINGS ON ITS CONTENTS IN THE COMING WEEKS. MANY OF THE REFORMS AND BUDGET REQUESTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY COME FROM THE WELL THOUGHT OUT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND THE EDT STRIKE TEAM. WE HAVE MET EVERY DEADLINE SET BY THE STATE AUDITOR AND SO SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY ONE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMPLETE ARE EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. THE REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WELL UNDER WAY INCLUDE HIRING AND TRAINING THE STAFF TO CARRY OUT WORKLOAD PLANNING AND IDENTIFYING AREAS FOR FUTURE AUTOMATED AUTOMATIC CLAIM PROCESSING. THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS OF WHICH THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED. 81% COMPLETE. INCLUDING 1100% OF THE SHORT TERM AND NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS. AS WE HAVE MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS AND IN FULL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE CREATED A PUBLIC AUDIT PROGRESS REPORT WEBPAGE THAT DETAILS THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I HOPE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IS A PRIORITY OF MINE IN MY NEW ROLE AS DIRECTOR SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION PROJECTS WERE PLANNED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. COVERING NINETEEN TESTED OUR SYSTEMS AND CAPABILITIES TO THEIR LIMITS AND CAUSE US TO RETHINK SOME OF OUR APPROACHES. IN RESPONSE WE REVISE THE DIRECTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION WORK TO BRING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN HANDLE MORE EXTREME SURGES IN CLAIM ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN LANGUAGE AND USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS CARRYING OUT OUR MISSION TO PROCLAIM ITS FIRST. DURING THE PANDEMIC EDT IS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BRANCH DELIVERED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPEED PAYMENT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO UPDATING THE LEGISLATURE AS WE AS WE PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT YEAR. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH THE TREMENDOUS HELP OF THIS COMMITTEE EDT. EXPANDED AND IMPROVED ITS LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY THIS INCLUDES MORE TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETER SERVICES INCLUDING A MULTI LINGUAL ACCESS PORTAL. AS WE ARE ALL AWARE ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIANS COMMUNICATE AND LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU NEED TO CONTINUE THIS WORK. RECENTLY EDT EXPANDED ITS TRANSLATION SERVICES AND TRAIN FRONT LINE STAFF TO CONNECT CALLERS WITH TRANSLATORS WHO CAN NOW ASSIST IN HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES. AND YOU MAY HAVE ALSO SEEN THAT JUST YESTERDAY EDT REACHED AGREEMENT WITH SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE L. A. P. COMMUNITY TO ADD MORE DEDICATED PHONE LINES WITH MULTI LINGUAL AGENTS AND EXPAND WRITTEN TRANSLATION OF VITAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE INFORMATION AN ONLINE RESOURCES. WE ALSO CREATED AND OUR STAFFING A LANGUAGE ACCESS OFFICE TO FURTHER EXPAND LANGUAGE TRANSLATION AND- SERVICE DESK AND WILL BE BUILDING OUT A MULTI LINGUAL WEBSITE ACCESS PORTAL. PORTAL WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE ON THIS BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT IN AS MANY LANGUAGES AS NEEDED TO INSURE. THIS POPULATION AS WELL SERVICE. IN CONCLUSION THE GOVERNOR'S BY PER. FOR EATING GAME UPON THE PROGRESS MADE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP WE DEVELOPED THE LEGISLATURE DURING THESE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TIMES PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE TO ASSIST CLAIMANTS IN YOUR DISTRICT OFFICES. AND MY TEAM IN HIGH HERE I'M SORRY MY TEAM AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR IS BAH APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK AND- STEPPING UP TO TAKE CHARGE HOPEFULLY AND THEN IN THE NEW- TIME I KNOW YOU WERE ALREADY AT THE EIGHTY D. BUT NOW AS DIRECTOR OF WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THE BIG CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE- WE WANT TO MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE FIVE. WERE ISSUE FIVE WE'RE GONNA MOVE INTO ISSUE FIVE ADDRESSING YOU WHY DEBT FINANCE- I DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT YOU'D DIRECTOR FOR YES ON ISSUE FIVE ADDRESSING YOU AYE DEBT FINANCE YOU ARE PATRICK TOP AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- REGARDING THE U. HIGH DEBT PAYMENTS CONSISTENT WITH EVEN GRAZING LIABILITIES INSTRUCTOR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE BUDGET INCLUDES ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TOTAL OF THREE MILLION THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO PAY DOWN THE U. I TRUST FUND LOAN THAT WAS TAKEN OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. GOING TO PAY YOU AYE BENEFIT UNDER INTERRUPTED IT WHEN THE PHONE WENT INSOLVENT IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS WILL REDUCE THE STATE'S LIABILITIES CELEBRATE THE PAYMENT OF THE DEBT AND REDUCE FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS AT COULD YOU WHY THAT IS CURRENTLY NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER TOPPEN- L. A. L. THANK YOU JUST DOWNLOAD THE L. A- LATE LAST MONTH OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT ON ON THIS ITEM IN PARTICULAR- AND SO JUST FOR CONTEXT AGAIN UNDER THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT ON THE STATE'S OUTSTANDING FEDERAL LOAN ON THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT 15% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN. AND AGAIN- EMPLOYERS WILL REPAY THAT THIS AMOUNT UNDER EXISTING FEDERAL TAX LAW OVER THE COMING YEARS AND- HISTORICALLY ARE CUSTOMARILY THE STATE HAS PAID THE INTEREST COST EACH YEAR OFF FROM THE GENERAL FUND- WE- IN OUR REPORT INCLUDE A COUPLE SCENARIOS IN WHICH WE MODELED THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS OF REPAYMENT TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL- WE ESTIMATE THAT THE PROPOSED THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT. WILL REDUCE STATE GENERAL FUND INTEREST COSTS BY BETWEEN FIVE AND FIFTY MILLION AND ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN- WHICH WE THINK WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF TEN TO TWELVE YEARS- ADDITIONALLY ARE WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL STATE INTEREST COSTS COULD RANGE FROM TWO AND A HALF TO SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S PRINCIPALLY DEPENDING ON FUTURE INTEREST RATES- WHICH AS WE'VE SEEN IN JUST RECENT. MONTHS ARE ARE LESS CERTAIN THAN THEY WERE- MAYBE. THIS TIME LAST YEAR- WE ALSO KNOW THAT PROPOSED BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT HAVE THE- OF REDUCING. EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES- AND THAT WOULD OCCUR IF THE PAYMENT. IN ESSENCE SHORTENS THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THAT EMPLOYERS ARE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY HIGHER FEDERAL. YOU AYE TAXES TO REPAY THE LOAN I'M WE DO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT. CERTAIN THAT THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSED PAYMENT WOULD SHORTEN THE LIFE OF THE LOAN- AND IF IT WERE NOT TO EMPLOYERS WOULD CONTINUE TO PAY THE INCREASED- FEDERAL YOU AYE PAYROLL TAXES BUT- ANY CARRYOVER REVENUE THAT WAS GENERATED FROM THAT. AFTER REPAYING THE LOAN FOR THE STATE'S YOU I TRUST FUND- AND THEREFORE HAVE SOME INDIRECT BENEFITS TO BOTH BUSINESSES AND THE STATE- BECAUSE THE PROPOSED PAYMENT WOULD NOT. DIRECTLY BENEFIT EMPLOYERS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS FOR THE END OF THE LONG PERIOD- WE DO PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE IF THE LEGISLATURE HE'S INTERESTED IN PROVIDING MORE IMMEDIATE. RELIEF TO WORKERS AND BUSINESSES- THE STATE COULD- CONTEMPLATING ALTERNATIVE WHEREBY. THE STATE PROVIDED YOU I PAYROLL TAX CREDITS TO BUSINESSES IN THE COMING YEARS TO DIRECTLY OFFSET THE AMOUNT OF INCREASED FEDERAL TAXES THEY'LL BE PAYING TO- READ BEGIN REPAYING THAT THE FED WOULD YOU AYE WELL- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR WALK THROUGH MODELING IN MORE DETAIL. APPRECIATIVE WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AGAIN. HAVE A BASE-QUESTION- ABOUT. OF THE STATE PUTTING IN A THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS FOR ME. IS AS YOU SAID THIS STATE THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITIES TO PAY INTEREST ON ANY LOAN THAT WE- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WHY. AND HOW DOES THE EMPLOYER'S RESPONSIBILITY UP TO FIT INTO THE PAYMENT OF THE LOAN. OF THE FEDERAL LOANS AND- HOW DOES THE- HERE. WHAT IS THE PART THAT- CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS YOU IS STATE TAXES IS THE LOWEST ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THIS NEW ACCUMULATED A DEBT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO ANSWER THAT. BUT I I'D BE HAPPY TO MADAM CHAIR- GETTING SAYS ALMOST THAT WITH THE L. A. O. OUT YOUR FIRST POINT I'M FEDERAL LAW OUR LONGSTANDING FEDERAL LAW DICTATES HOW. FEDERAL YOU AYE LOANS ARE TO BE REPAID- AND SO YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT CUSTOMARILY THE STATE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING- THAT THE ANNUAL INTEREST COSTS AND EMPLOYERS PAY REPAY ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN AND NEVER PAYMENT PLAN IF YOU WILL IT- AS FOR IN TRYING TO GET IN FEDERAL TAX LAW- AND IT INVOLVES BASICALLY AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL PORTION OF YOU AYE TABLE TAXES. OVER TIME AS LONG AS THE LOAN REMAINS OUTSTANDING UNTIL THE LOAN IS. ON THIS WAS THE SAME PROCESS THAT THE STATE AND EMPLOYERS FOLLOWED- FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN THE STATE ALSO BORROWED. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR YOU I BENEFITS- IF YOU REMIND ME AGAIN OF THE SECOND QUESTION I NOW LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT PRETTY WELL I AND I SEE IN THE IMPROVE. BACK HIM FOR. THAT SINCE NINE EIGHTY- CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS YOU Y. STATE TAXES THE LOWEST ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW- HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THIS. WE'RE NOW HAVING TO PAY MORE. OF OBVIOUSLY FOR A DAD AND A LOAN THAT NOBODY EVER EXPECTED NOBODY. COULD IMAGINE THAT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET HERE THE CONNECTION ON THE CLARITY AS TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EMPLOYERS IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. AND HOW THIS LOW- TAX RATE- FITS INTO ALL OF THAT. THE ADDAMS SHARED- AS YOU MENTIONED ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THE STATE'S YOU AYE PAYROLL TAX BASE INSTEAD OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT IS THE LOWEST ALLOWABLE AMOUNT UNDER FEDERAL LAW- MANY STATES HAVE HIGHER TAX BASES- BUT A LOT OF THOSE STATES TO. TURN LEVY A LOWER RATES- AGAINST THAT THEIR HIGHER TAX BASES BUT IN GENERAL- IF THE STATE WERE TO INCREASE THE U. I. PAYROLL TAX BASED IT WOULD HAVE HAD THE EFFECT OF. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE STATE YOU I TRUST FUND WHICH HEADING INTO THE PANDEMIC WHAT ELSE WOULD PUT THE STATE IN A BETTER POSITION TO CONTINUE PAYING BENEFITS FOR A LONGER PERIOD. PRIOR TO TURNING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR LOANS- I WILL CAUTION THOUGH THAT. EVEN HAVE THE STATE TAKEN. STEPS TO IMPROVE THE FISCAL POSITION OF THE U. I TRUST FUND. THE PANDEMIC WAS SO ENORMOUS IN MAGNITUDE IT'S LIKELY THAT UNDER EVEN THE BEST OF SCENARIOS- THE STATE WOULD HAVE HAD TO REACH OUT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE PAYING LOANS. ARE TO CONTINUE PAYING BENEFITS- BUT- IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT AT THIS POINT. AS A RESULT THE STATE WOULD HAVE NOT FEWER OUTSTANDING LOANS- TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR TECHNICAL WORK. OKAY FOR NOW WITH THAT SAID- NUMBERS. SENATE CRITICIZING THE CENTER TO GROW. THIS IS PROBABLY QUESTIONS MUCH FOR FINANCES THE ONLY OPEN- BUT FOR SOME REASON I FEEL LIKE DIRECTED TO THE OLE OLE I'M A LITTLE- BUT I GUESS I PROMISE I HAVE WITH WITH LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN IN ANY ORGANIZATION PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. IS THERE THE BEST. RESOLVED OFTENTIMES BY- KEEPING THEM. KEEPING THE BUSINESS ON THE BALLOT SHEET METAL WORDS TAKING. AN ASSET IN THE LIQUIDATING IT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO A TO PAY OFF THE LIABILITY THAT'S ON THE BALANCE SHEET SO YOU BASICALLY HAVE. YOU KNOW A NET- THE NET ZERO RESULTS IN YOUR COLLEGE. THE IDEA OF SUPPLYING- A LONG TERM STATE CREDIT AT THE BUSINESSES TO HELP THEM TO HE NOTED TO OFFSET THAT THE FEDERAL COSTS EIGHT AGREES- INNOVATIVE- BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT SHIFTING- A BALANCE SHEET. LIABILITY OVER TO OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND- WHERE WE HAVE ONGOING COSTS WHO WAS MOST CERTAINLY HAVE RISING ONGOING COSTS IN THE FUTURE WE MOST CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A PERIOD OF TIME IN THE FUTURE WE ARE EXPERIENCING SURPLUSES SO. THAT WITH THAT BACKDROP MY THINKING- HAVE YOU LOOKED AT. IS THIS SOME KIND OF- OPPORTUNITY. HI I'M TO USE FIXED ASSETS THAT ARE NO LONGER. NEEDED BY THE STATE ID I THINK OF EXCESS LANDS WERE TOLD BY- AT LEAST ONE OF OUR AGENCIES THAT'S MAPPED OUT THE EXCESS LANDS FOR THE STATE THAT WE HAVE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PARCELS OF EXCESS LAND IN THE STATE- WOULD IT MAKE ANY SENSE- IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO- EITHER ELIMINATE OR START THE FRAME OR MITIGATE. THE INTEREST PAYMENTS WERE PAID ON THIS DEBT TO USE. EXCESSIVE LAND LIQUIDATION- FOR THE TIME BEING TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE PARCELS OFF OF OUR- OF THE ASSET SALE ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. AND HANDED TAKE THOSE ONE TIME DOLLARS TO REDUCE ITS DEBT. IT SEEMS TO ME YOU COULD STILL. A BOOK THE LIABILITY- HERE TO THE BUSINESSES HOWEVER YOU WANTED GOOD IN IN THAT WAY IT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP THE GENERAL FUND BY. DIFFERENT INTEREST COSTS WITHOUT PASSING ANY NEW COSTS ON TO THE GENERAL FUND. SENATOR CORTESE SAYS ALMOST THE L. A. O. I. PROBABLY WOULD NEED TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS TO WHETHER THEY'VE LOOKED INTO IT OR THE POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS E'D BE HAPPY TO. EXPLORE THE IDEA WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF- BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE LOOKED AT SPECIFICALLY. GREAT THAT'S- BUT THE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU TO LOOK AT IT YET WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IN JUST THE SAME QUESTION FOR FINANCES. IN EXPLORING OPTIONS SO HAVE YOU LOOKED AT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED. ASSEMBLY CORTESE OF HUNDRED TOPPING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I DO NOT BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ALTHOUGH WE JUST SORT OF UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE EASY THIS WAS THE MOST DIRECT WAY OF PAYING DOWN. KEEP A BOOK WILL CIRCLE BACK. IN ALSO THE MEDIAN TRUCKS FOR THAT'LL FURTHER APPRECIATED I'M SURE THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MA'AM SHARON THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THOSE QUESTIONS IT'S A GREAT IDEA- ON LEVERAGING ASSETS I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- THE CHAIR MENTION THAT WE HAVE THE LOWEST RATE- I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THAT SO SOMEBODY COULD EXPLAIN IT TO ME I WOULD. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE PAY ROUGHLY SIX POINT 9% ON THE FIRST SEVEN THOUSAND. AND THAT'S INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE WITH THE FOOD A TAX REDUCTION CREDIT. DEBT IS- THAT WOULD LOAN REPAYMENT MECHANISM AND THAT IS BILL TO EMPLOYERS ON A AND YOU'LL PLEASE BASIS PLUS WE HAVE A 15% EMERGENCY SURCHARGE. WHICH IS ROUGHLY ESTIMATE ON MY BRIEF CALCULATIONS AGAIN I'M- AT A FINANCE PERSON BUT- THAT'S- IT'S LIKE 65% HIGHER THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION CALIFORNIA LEADS THE HIGHEST TAX INCREASE FOR EMPLOYMENT. SO- IS THAT TRUE OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE THE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LIKE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT QUESTION WAS GOING. I'M SORRY WHO ARE YOU ASKING CENTER THAT I GUESS THE L. A. OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SENATOR PATRICK TOPPING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THE QUESTION I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ANSWERED HIS DIRECT WAYS POSSIBLE. SO THE CHAIR MENTIONED THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT ARE YOU I TAX RATE. AND IT HASN'T BEEN CHANGED SINCE WHATEVER YEAR WAS MENTIONED. BUT A QUICK REFERENCE ON NET AND STATE YOU AYE RATES CALIFORNIA'S AT SIX POINT 9% ON THE FIRST SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EARNED FOR EMPLOYERS- SKEWS ME EMPLOYEES AND AN ADDITIONAL 15% EMERGENCY SURCHARGE. COMPARED TO OTHER STATES THAT ARE THREE POINT ONE TWO POINT FIVE POINT FIVE ZERO SOME OF THEM HAVE AND THEN SOME OF THEM ARE EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER SHARED COST WHERE THE EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT IN IS THAT NUMBER CORRECT THAT AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST YOU AYE TAX RATE WITH THE SIX POINT NINE AND 15% SURCHARGE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES OR IS THAT NOT CORRECT. THANK YOU I'M GOING TO DEFER THAT TO MY COLLEAGUES OVER EDIE WHO HAVE MORE PROGRAMMATIC KNOWLEDGE THAN I DO. THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU SARAH GROW FOR THE QUESTION- CALEB MORAL ON THE FISCAL OFFICER FOR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. SO THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS HERE AND I THINK THE ONE THAT'S MENTIONED YOU GENDER THAT THE CHASSIS ALLUDED TO. IS THE TAXABLE WAGE BASE SO THAT THE WAGES THAT THE TAX RATES PAID OFF OF. AND THAT IS CORRECT THAT CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH A HANDFUL OF OTHER STATES HAS THE LOWEST TAXABLE WAGE BASE. THAT'S PRESCRIBED UNDER FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MANY OTHER STATES HAVE A HIGHER TAXABLE WAGE BASE IN CALIFORNIA. AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL TAX RATE GOES THAT'S ALSO PRESCRIBE BY FEDERAL LAW TO- AND FEDERAL LAW DICTATES THAT AND THAT STATES HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST AT A TAX RATE OF FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT- CALIFORNIA'S TAX RTE AS YOU MENTIONED. WITH THE EMERGENCY SURCHARGE CAN BE UP TO SIX POINT TWO PERCENT- I BELIEVE- AT LEAST BASED ON DATA FROM TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT CALIFORNIA IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AS FAR AS ARE ON AVERAGE- YOU I TAX STREET IN COMPARISON. TO ALL THE STATES ACROSS THE NATION. I APPRECIATE THAT PLEASE THING YOU SO THAT THAT THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE BROUGHT UP WAS BASED ON THE TAXABLE RATE OF THE SEVEN FOR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EARNED IN THAT I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. NGUYEN AND THIS LOAN REPAYMENT IS DONE AND- OR IT WHEN THIS LOAN REPAYMENT HAS TO START TAKING PLACE. EMPLOYERS WILL IT BE DONE LIKE IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WITH THE FOOD TAX REDUCTION CREDIT- AT THE END OF THE YEAR OR IS IT GONNA BE PAID DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR. THIS TIME. BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED SOME HORRIFIC LESSONS. ON THAT FITTED TAX REDUCTION PAYMENT THAT COST. OF BUSINESSES TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS- IN THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THE LAST TIME THAT WE RAN DEBT. AT THE END OF THE YEAR OBVIOUSLY PAYER QUARTERLY TAXES AND IT INCLUDES YOUR- AND EMPLOYMENT TAXES ON THE FOR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK IT'S A- D. SIX. THE EMPLOYER SEND AN- AND- WHICH INCLUDES A DISABILITY- ALL THE WAGES THAT YOU PAID OF THE STATE OR SKEWS ME TAXES THAT YOU PAID OF THE STATE. SO IS THIS LOAN REPAYMENT ON THE PRINCIPAL GONNA BE PAID BACK BY EMPLOYERS AT THE END OF THE YEAR FOR A LUMP SUM PAYMENT. WHICH THEY CONSIDERED OR CALL DEFEATED TAX REDUCTION CREDIT PAYMENT. LIKE IT WAS BEFORE OR IS THERE A DIFFERENT PAYMENT SCHEDULE THAT YOU GUYS ARE THINKING OF. SENATE DEMOCRATIC UP AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGES TO FEDERAL STATE LAW SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN SO- IN. THE MECHANISM OF REPAYING IS THE SAME ALL DIFFERENT TO MY COLLEAGUES IN EASIER FOR THE ACTUAL MECHANISM TO PREPAY. THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU SIR FOR THE QUESTION AGAIN AND- FUND DEPARTED FINANCES CORRECT- THAT THAT IS THE MECHANISM THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS ABSENT CHANGES TO THE U. I. FINANCING STRUCTURE ITSELF- AS YOU MENTIONED THAT THE FOOD A TAX CREDIT. REDUCTION ACTUALLY STARTS THIS CALENDAR YEAR THOSE TAXES BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE THOSE INCREASED FEDERAL TAX BY EMPLOYERS THE BEGINNING OF THE FOLLOWING COUNTY OR SO THAT'LL OCCUR IN AROUND JANUARY FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONE NO START PAYING OUT HIGHER FEDERAL TAX RATE. BUT THAT IS THE MECHANISM THAT THE FEDS USE ABSENT ANYTHING ELSE THAT- FOR STATES TO KIND OF PAY DOWN THE PRINCIPAL AS YOU INDICATED. IS THERE A CONCERN WITH ANY OF YOU EITHER OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE EDG- WITH THE REDUCTION- THE REDUCTION IN PROFITS FOR ON A RESTAURANT SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT AND- BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR BUSINESS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM COMING UP WITH THAT ADDITIONAL SIXTY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. EVERY YEAR ON THE PHONE ECAUSE I THINK ONCE YOU GET THE BILL ON THE FIRST OR SECOND IN JANUARY TO DO BY THE FIFTEENTH. SO THEY'D HAVE TO. COME UP WITH THOSE RESOURCES- IS THERE WITHIN TWO WEEKS IS THAT A CONCERN FOR ANY OF YOU WAS STRUGGLING BUSINESSES. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR SAYS THAT WE HAVE AND- WE'RE LEADING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY- AT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BUT YOU KNOW DATA SHOWS THAT. WE'RE NOT WE'RE ACTUALLY LAGGING BEHIND- WITH BUSINESS FOR. BUSINESSES GETTING BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC DAYS. SO IS THERE A CONCERN ON ANY OF YOUR PART. ABOUT BUSINESSES BEING ABLE TO- MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE OF THAT FOOD A TAX REDUCTION CREDIT PAYMENT THAT WILL BE D<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; WITH LOWER&lt;/c&gt;</u> REVENUES FROM BUSINESSES. SENATOR PATRICK TOBIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- REGARDING THIS IS PRECISELY WHY WE ARE PROPOSING A THREE MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT- TO ACCELERATE THE PAYOFF OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT THAT BY UP TO A YEAR- AND RESTORE THOSE- FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX TAX. TAX CREDITS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. NO AND I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S OPERATE PRECIADO OF WHAT THEY CALL THE NEW DEMOCRATS ON THE ASSEMBLY WITH THEIR SEVEN AND A QUARTER BILLION DOLLAR. RELATED REQUESTS TO- AND OPEFULLY THERE'S NEGOTIATION FOR A HIGHER NUMBER OF A PAY OUT SO I APPRECIATE THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS I DO. AND I UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS- BUT THAT PRIMARILY GOES TO INTERESTED DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT I THINK IT'S NINETEEN POINT SIX- BILLION OR IS IT TWENTY ONE WHAT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER AT WITH THE TOTAL. DEBT NOW. SENATOR IS NINETEEN POINT SIX SIX NINETEEN POINT SIX BILLION AND TO BE CLEAR THE THREE BILLION IS TO LOWER THE DEBT.

FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR OKAY THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT IS I APPRECIATE IT EVEN MORE NOW THAT YOU CLARIFY THAT. AND OKAY I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS LET ME SEE IF I HAVE I THOUGHT I HAD ONE MORE. AND. IS THERE ANYTHING I KNOW THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL A DOLLAR NUMBER OF FRAUD AT AN AMOUNT OF FRAUD THAT TOOK PLACE AND AGAIN I KNOW THAT EDT AND I KNOW THAT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS- NOT COME FULL CIRCLE BUT TAKEN LEAPS AND BOUNDS OF WHERE THEY WERE- IN ADDRESSING. YOU KNOW FRAUD AND OVER PAYMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IS THAT- I THINK THAT THE NEXT ISSUE. THAT WE WILL BE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF FRAUD.

HOWEVER OF THAT TWENTY BILLION ABOUT A BILLION OF THAT IS TIED TO REGULAR YOU AYE PAYMENT SO THE PAYMENTS THAT COME OUT OF OUR TRUST FUND. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT IN COMPARISON TO THE REGULAR YOU ARE PAYMENTS THAT THE DEPARTMENTS PAID OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC IT ACTUALLY AMOUNTS TO AROUND THREE TO FOUR PERCENT. OF THE OVERALL- REGULAR YOU AYE PAYMENT CENTER CONSIDERED FRAUDULENT- THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS WITHIN IN ANY NORMAL YEAR THERE'S OBVIOUSLY FRAUD IN AN INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT THAT'S WITHIN THE NORMAL AMOUNT THIS WITHIN OUR OUR REGULAR YOU AYE PROGRAM IN A NORMAL YEAR- BUT IT IS INCLUDED IN THAT OVERALL FIGURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S- WHEN WE DEAL WITH BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT SIGNIFICANT BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO THE RESTAURANT OWNER WHO'S SPEAKING COSTS WENT UP.

PRIOR TO DISQUALIFICATION AB THREE NINETY SEVEN REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE NOTICE AND ALLOW CLAIMING TO DISPUTE THE POTENTIAL DISQUALIFICATION. THE CLAIMANT HAS THREE TO TEN DAYS TO RESPOND AND ET HAS UNTIL SEPTEMBER FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO MAKE THE NECESSARY FORM AND SYSTEM CHANGES. THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE REQUESTED MYSELF MY COLLEAGUES ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS PLEASE. THANK YOU JUDGE ALL OF THE L. A. AGAIN- WE HAVE COMMENTS. IN REGARD TO THE FIRST PROPOSAL AND EVEN MORE SPECIFICALLY. TO THE FIVE VENDOR CONTRACTS THAT ARE RELATED TO EATING IS ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS I'M REALLY SUPPORT- TWO WEEKS AGO ON THIS TOPIC BUT TO BE ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY TO TOLD YOU AND STAFF- IN SHORT. WE RECOMMEND FOR THESE FIVE CONTRACTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONLY APPROVED ONE OF THE CONTRACTS. WOULD BE TO CONTRACT TO PREVENT BOT ATTACKS THAT COULD DISRUPT OR OR SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY EDIE'S WEBSITE- AND WE RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING ACTION. FOR REJECTING THE OTHER ANTI FRAUD CONTRACTS AND THIS IS FOR THREE MAIN REASONS THAT WE MAKE HIS RECOMMENDATIONS- FIRST IN THE REPORT WE POINT OUT- AS MR AFOREMENTIONED- JUST MOMENTS AGO THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FRAUD THAT OCCURRED- IN THE U. I. PROGRAM DURING THAT. THE PANDEMIC TARGETED TEMPORARY FEDERAL BENEFITS FOR SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS THAT WERE FEDERALLY FUNDED AND SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT- ELIGIBILITY RULES THEN THE STATES YOU AYE PROGRAM. AND THIS PROGRAM- ENDED IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR SO THE ONGOING FRAUD RISK- THAT WAS SO HEAVILY CONCENTRATED AND THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM HAS NOW ENDED UP MAKING THAT THE NEED FOR STATE ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS GOING FORWARD. MUCH LESS CRITICAL SECONDLY- TURNING TO THE STATE YOU LIVE FRAUD THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND CENTER GROVE I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO TERM THE QUESTION YOU HAD DURING THE LAST ITEM ON THE MINISTRATION HAS NOTED TAT ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS. IN STATE YOU LIVE BENEFITS ARE SUSPECTED AS AS HAVING BEEN FRAUDULENT AND SO THIS IS FOR THE REGULAR STATE YOU AYE PROGRAM NOT THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- BUT FOR A FEW REASONS WEEK WE THINK THOSE THAT LEVEL OF SUSPECTED. FRAUDULENT CLAIMS MIGHT BE- OVERSTATED SOMEWHAT AND THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THAT THE AMOUNT OF FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY IN THE STATE'S REGULAR PROGRAM IS MUCH. LOWER THAN THAT POTENTIALLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR HOURS OR SO- THIS IS THE STATE. YOU AYE PROGRAM SEVERAL BILL IN STATE. THAT PREVENT OR WILL. ARM BANDS OF FROM BUT FEDERAL PROGRAM- DOES NOT HAVE. AN WOMEN HIS RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE MOST FOR WITH THESE ANTI FRAUD CONTRACTS. RUNS COUNTER TO THE STRIKE TEAMS OWN RECOMMENDATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE POINT TO IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. MUST SORT OF MOVING AWAY FROM A- EIGHT. EIGHT INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS ON FRAUD ELIMINATION AND MUST REVIEW AND ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS. BUT ALSO THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF FOR LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS OF ITS ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS- WE UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT HAS LEARNED LESSONS. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC- BUT GIVEN THAT THE RISK IS NOW SUBSIDING- AND GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT'S SORT OF. HISTORY WITH WITH A FOCUS ON FRIDAY ELIMINATION POTENTIALLY AFTER THE- TO THE DATA APPROACH ACTS OR TIME PAIN. WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THESE OP RECOMMENDED PROJECTIONS AND PENN WANT TO SORT OF HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THAT THE CONTRACT WITH WHICH WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON AND IT IS A CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY CALLED ID MEAN FOR IDENTITY VERIFICATION. UNDERSTAND HIGHER ID NEED TO PERFORM ONE TO ONE FACIAL RECOGNITION MATCHES BOB THIS WAS IN THE LATE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND IS IN ESSENCE YOU TAKE A SHORT VIDEO ON YOUR WEBCAM AND COME. A COMPUTER COMPARES IT TO THE DRIVER'S LICENSE OR PASSPORT THAT YOU UPLOAD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE SAME PERSON SO YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE- WE THINK. THAT THIS WRITING RECOMMENDATION THAT HE BE DOCUMENTED IN IN THE LATE SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY WAS WARRANTED AT THE TIME GIVEN THE CRISIS WITH WITH THE BACKLOG AND WITH FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS BUT NOW THAT THAT PERIOD HAS PASSED ON THE STATE MAY WANT TO RECONSIDER ITS USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE. ARE PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR I'M GOING FORWARD IN THE STATE'S PROGRAM AND THIS A RECOMMENDATION TO WITHHOLD ACTION ON IT ME CONTRACTED COMES IT'S DIFFICULT THE FOLLOWING- SOME RECENT SCRUTINY THAT THE COMPANY HAS COME UNDER FOR POTENTIALLY. MISLEADING CLIENTS- THE- THEY COME. HAS HAD NOTED NOT ONLY WAS IT PERFORM THESE ONE TWO ONE MATCH AS THE STATE UNDERSTOOD IT'S CONTRACT TO BE FOR IT WAS ALSO PERFORMING. WHAT'S KNOWN AS A ONE TIME MANY MATCH AND SO IN ESSENCE THE SHORT WEBCAM VIDEO THAT THAT IS TAKEN- IS NOT ONLY COMPARED MY DRIVER'S LICENSE IN THIS EXAMPLE BUT- IS COMPARED TO A DATA BANK OUT OF. OF MILLIONS OF OTHER PHOTOS THAT I DO ME- HOLDS HOUR PRIVACY EXPERTS AND- AND OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THERE ARE. POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE- THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR A SUBSTANTIAL. OF SYSTEMIC RACISM AND OTHER KEY ISSUES OF EQUITY- TYING TO THE NOTION OF USING ONE TO MANY- OF FACIAL RECOGNITION STEPS AND FOR THIS REASON THIS IS ALL SORT OF HAPPENING IN REAL TIME THIS IS. A RECENT DEVELOPMENT WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO HOLD ACTION. AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. FOR THE STATE YOU LIVE PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE FINANCE LIKE TO WOOD FINDS LIKE TO COMMENT. BETTER TOP AND THE BOTTOM THE FINANCE NO INITIAL COMMENTS I HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY I'D LIKE TO HEAR BACK FROM THE- EDT- UM RESPONSE TO THE L. ALES RECOMMENDATIONS. SHORT NAME THE VARIOUS WITH EDT I'LL TAKE THE OVER ARCHING- THE RESPONSE FIRST SO WE FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE THE L. A. O.'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE KNOWLEDGE MEANS THAT YOU KNOW THE STRIDES THAT WE'VE MADE AND YOU KNOW THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- AS THEY HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE OF COURSE IN THE LEGISLATURE. NOW THAT BEING SAID SOME OF THE REFERENCES- THAT ALEJO MAKES OUR YOU KNOW NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF OLD DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC- AS EVIDENCE OF A FRAUD CULTURE AT EDT I YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE VERY SMART EMPLOYEES AT EDT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE DO LOOK AT DATA FOR ANY DECISION THAT'S MADE IT EASY DAY. YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T ALSO WAY COMMONSENSE BUT WE DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT AT THE DATA- WHEN I RE READ THE STRAIGHT TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WAS ACTUALLY RELEASED BEFORE I CAME TO EDT ABOUT FOUR DAYS BEFORE I CAME TO DANCE A TIME OF TWENTY TWENTY- YOU KNOW AND THE L. A. POINTS OUT THAT WE ARE RUNNING COUNTER TO THE STRIKE TEAM- I THINK THAT THE STRIKE TEAM WAS TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE'S YOU KNOW THE FRAUD CULTURE IS TALKING ABOUT THE WORKERS THAT EDT WHEN THERE WAS A MANUAL PROCESS- I CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT'S AT LEAST ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE STRIKE TEAM SUGGESTED THAT WE USE A VENDOR THAT MEETS YOU KNOW FEDERAL. IDENTITY STANDARD ID ME OF COURSE- BECAUSE IT TAKES A MANUAL PROCESS OUT OF- OUT OF IT AND IT ELIMINATES ANY FRAUD CULTURE- I WOULD I WOULD THINK- AND I JUST JUST A REMINDER THAT YOU KNOW THESE TOOLS WORK HE STRIKE TEAM AN AUDITOR RECOMMENDATIONS. AT NIGHT I UNDERSTAND THE NARRATIVE AROUND THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING FRAUD ELIMINATION AT THE EXPENSE EXPENSE OF PROMPT AND STRAIGHT FORWARD PAYMENTS BUT I WILL SAY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S THE OPPOSITE I MEAN THE LAST THE LAST FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT THAT. WE DEAL WITH ON THE FRONT END. I THINK THE QUICKER WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO AND WE- THAT YOU KNOW. THE IN AND BEYOND AND I'M- YOU KNOW SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE HAD TO RETHINK. LOTS OF POLICIES THAT NO LONGER SERVE THE NEEDY OR CLAIMANTS AND OUR STAFF. ARE AMAZING I'VE SEEN YOU I STAFF. YOUKNOW WORK WITH EXTENSION OF ONE OF THE VENDORS IN OUR B. C. P. TO HELP US. SIFT THROUGH THE DATA AND FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHERE WE WENT RIGHT WHERE WE WENT WRONG. AND BASED ON THAT WE CHANGE OUR FIVE ARE FIVE DOCTORS BOTH INTERNALLY AND WITH THOMSON REUTERS WHICH IS ANOTHER VENDOR- IN OUR BCP. YOU KNOW IN MOVING FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO BE USING THE NEW FRAUD UNIT. THAT WAS CREATED INTERNALLY AT EDT- THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION- TO CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE FRAUD FILTERS AND ADJUST AS NECESSARY. AND USING THIS TEAM YOU KNOW WHAT TOM SOME WRITERS WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THAT OUR FILTERS- YOU KNOW. IMMEDIATELY AND ONE THING I JUST WANT TO REITERATE AND I'LL WRAP UP MY COMMENTS- IS YOU KNOW I SAID THIS LAST WEEK AT THE HEARINGI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY AGAIN. I THINK THAT WE ARE UNDER ESTIMATING WHAT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND THE IDENTITY STEPS THAT WENT ON AND THAT CONTINUES QUITE FRANKLY TO GO ON. YOU KNOW ALMOST EVERYONE THAT I KNOW WHY THERE HAD SOME SORT OF SCAM SENT TO THEM. EDT RELATED OR NOT. YOU KNOW OR KNEW SOMEONE THAT DID AND I THINK THAT SAYING THAT THE FRAUD IS OVER. YOU KNOW NOW THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE HULA- IS DANGEROUS- YOU KNOW AND TO THE ALLEY OF THIS POINT YOU KNOW. THAT I'M DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO THIS BEFORE THE HEARINGS BUT- YEAH WE'D BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH THE L. A. O. TO REVIEW THE DATA THAT THEY USED TO COME UP WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. ON BECAUSE WE CAN COMPARE IT TO THE DATA THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE AS I THINK YOU'RE ALL AWARE. YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN OF THE TICKET- TO. DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND SOME OF THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY IN THE B. P. CENTER I DO MEAN FOR A- ARE PREFERRED. US WITH THAT DATA. OPERA THE AUDITORS RECOMMENDED. OKAY I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ID ME SITUATION AS WELL AS YOU'D LIKE YES PLEASE SURE SO CURRENTLY ARE MEETING WITH SOME OTHER STATES TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING BASED ON THE FRONT THAT THEY HAVE SEEN WORKING WITH ID NEED. AND JUST LAST WEEK- AS AS- CHAD MENTIONED YOU KNOW- WE ARE WORKING WITH ID NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER WAYS TO VERIFY IDENTITY WITHOUT USING FACIAL RECOGNITION AND ONE OF THE WAYS IS LAST WEEK THE- I. D. NY. ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE IRS THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS EITHER UPLOAD A SELFIE AND DELETE IT OR TO GO THROUGH A TRUSTED REFEREE WHICH IS A LIVE PERSON- WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT STILL AGAIN TALKING TO OTHER STATES TO FIGURE OUT- WHAT THEY ARE DOING TALKING TO OUR VENDORS SUCH TO SEE THEM. SORT OF FRAUD TO SEE IF THEY WOULD ADDRESS THE TYPE OF FRAUD THAT THEY ARE SEEING BUT- ABSENT ANY- YOU KNOW ANYTHING AGREED JUST- WE SEE NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T FOLLOW WHAT. THE IRS IS DOING. BOB IS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S CERTAIN ELEMENTS AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY. BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT ID ME ID ME- OF THAT ADD USES AND IT'S A VERIFICATION PROCESS. SO ARE WE WHAT ARE WE SACRIFICING. IF WE DON'T USE ID ME- IN YOU KNOW SOME MIGHT CONSIDER IT A DOWNGRADE TO- TO DO TONIGHT DO EVERYTHING- THEN THERE'S FACIAL RECOGNITION SO. WHERE IS THE RIGHT USAGE OF THESE ELEMENTS. THAT THAT THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND ONE AND IN WHICH YOU KNOW AGAIN WE ARE ASKING AND TALKING TO OTHER STATES AS WELL AS OUR- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE VENDORS THAT WE HAVE- EXCLUDING ID ME OTHER VENDORS AS WELL. I THINK THAT- AND I CAN ARE CHAU IT IS MUCH MORE TECHNICALLY SAVVY THAN I AM ON THAT BUT- GETTING RID OF THE SELFIE OR THE TRUSTED RIGHT FOR ME REFEREE AS I UNDERSTAND IT- WOULD JUST BE BASICALLY STRAIGHT UP IDENTITY THEFT SO YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO TO THE DARK WEB IN BY MY INFORMATION FOR SIX DOLLARS AND SIXTY TWO CENTS AS I'M SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHOSE INFORMATION IS. IN ON THE DARK WEB PAGE- AND ONCE YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION- YOU KNOW YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH DO ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH THAT- YOU KNOW AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IS YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE FBI THAT THE SCAMMERS THEIR DATE THEY HAVE HAD ALL THE U. Y. SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT AND THEY'RE VERY SOPHISTICATED WE DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. NEXT ANDI DID MENTION THIS ALSO NEXT WEEK THAT THE LAST WEEK I'M SORRY THAT THE F. B. I. PUT OUT A MEDIA ADVISORY JUST LAST WEEK AS I MENTIONED SO AFTER C ENDED SO TO THE L. A. O.'S POINT ABOUT THE PRIDE OF BEING LESS- NOW I YOU KNOW THIS IS AFTER PRO ENDED AT ONE STAGE ABOUT SCAMMERS EXPLOITING JOB BOARDS. AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITES TO IMPERSONATE LEGIT BUSINESSES AND CLAIMANTS IN ORDER TO GET YOU Y. SO AT EIGHT AYE IT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD BE AMAZED TO SEE WHAT WE ARE PROVIDING AS FAR AS WHAT'S ON THE DARK WEB IN THE CHATTER IN THE ATTEMPT- I'M GOVERNMENT BENEFITS FRAUD RIGHT NOW- BUT I'D I'D PROBABLY TALK TOO MUCH BUT I CAN LET THE CIO- MAYBE DISCUSS SOME OF THE NUANCES OF THE TECHNOLOGY- IF THAT DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- YES IF YOU HAVE. IF YOU HAVE SOME. UNANSWERED THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. YES GOOD MORNING- READ A GUY ET SO WHAT YOU NEED IT WAS AS IF WE DOWNGRADE TO ELIMINATE THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICE IS OUR ABILITY TO PROVE THE IDENTITY WE USED ID ME AS AN IDENTITY PROOFING TOOL POTENTIALLY STOLEN IDENTITIES USE BY ORGAN ORGANIZED CRIMINALS WILL NOT BE DISCOVERED DURING THE SCREENING PROCESS BECAUSE I NEED ME WILL ONLY BE CHECKING IF THE PERSON SPACE SUBMITTING THE IDENTIFICATION. PROOF MATCHES THE GOVERNMENT IDENTIFICATION PAPERWORK NOT IF THIS PERSON HAS TRIED MANY TIMES TO BEFORE USING OTHER IDENTITIES WHAT HAD HAPPENED I THAT I DIDN'T EACH UP FOUND IS THAT ONE PERSON COULD BE USING THE SAME PHOTO AND THE SAME DRIVERS LICENSE WITH DIFFERENT NAMES AND THAT'S HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH THAT YOU KNOW THIS ONE PERSON WHAT IT SUBMITTED FIVE TEN OR MULTIPLE- IDENTITIES DEBRA. FILE- UNEMPLOYMENT. SO THE DAY THAT HAVE BEEN. WITH WITH USING ID ME CONTINUE TO USE IT EXCITING THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE QUESTION IS THAT THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CREATED BOM BOM BY ID ME YOU FEEL THAT. THOSE ARE NOT- SO SERIOUS THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO USE IT ME. SENATE OUR IDENTITY VARIOUS- WITH IDEALLY I WOULDN'T WITH EDT- I WOULD SAY THAT WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY- WHICH IS WHY WE ARE TALKING TO OTHER STATES AS WELL AS THE ID YOU KNOW AS WELL AS THE ID ME ABOUT PUTTING IN PLACE BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS WHICH TAKES OUT THE FACIAL RECOGNITION PIECE OF IT IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- ID NY HAS IMPLEMENTED- A PROCESS BY WHICH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO UPLOAD A SELFIE BECAUSE THAT IS PROBABLY THE ROUTE THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD GO BECAUSE IT'S QUICKER TO UPLOAD A SELFIE AND THEN YOU CAN DELETE IT AFTER. YOU KNOW THAT IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THAT SELFIE THAT LET'S SAY YOU MATCH WITH SOMEONE- FROM ANOTHER STATE THAT A LIVE PERSON WILL COME ON TO THAT WILL APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN- AND COME ON TO THE SCREEN TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THERE IS NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT THAT IS PART OF- WHAT THEY ARE DOING I BELIEVE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AGAIN. THAT IS THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE HEADED IN WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION YOU DON'T BASED ON ALSO WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING BUT YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED LAST WEEK WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE AN ISSUE WITH US FOLLOWING- THE PROCESS THAT THE IRS IS- THAT IS NOW- IMPLEMENTED WITH ID ME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY DIRECT- ANY OTHER THING MEMBERS SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU ENSURE. TIME SHOW. I YEAH WE STARTED USING ID ME TO SOLVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN THE PROBLEM RELATED THE PANDEMIC IN THE AND THE INABILITY DURING THE PANDEMIC'S FROM PEOPLE TO PRESENT THEMSELVES PERSONALLY RIGHT PHYSICALLY. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION REDUCED IS TO WHAT EXTENT- LOOKING FORWARD TO IT ARE WE PRESUPPOSING THAT ID ME WILL HAVE A PROMINENT ROLE IN MEDICINE AND SO AS COALBED SUBSIDES- AS WE CAN RETURN TO SOMETHING MORE LIKE NORMAL LIFE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE BALANCE WHERE DOES IT ME FIT INTO OR OR OR OTHER TOOLS LIKE IT. FIT INTO SOMETHING LIKE A RETURN TO NORMALCY WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY VISIT EIGHTY OFFICES. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SENATOR AND YOU KNOW ASK AS A SENATOR DRAWS SO MENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING THE WORLD IS NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME. AGAIN I DON'T THINK- BUT- THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY OPENED UP OUR EYES I THINK TO SOME OF THE- TRANSGRESSIONS AND MISGIVINGS OF THE WORLD BUT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE ARE WE WILL HAVE AN IDENTITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM- WE ARE AND YOU WILL SEE IN THE MAY REVISION. OUR PROPOSAL- FOR A NEW I. T. PROJECT- A NEW IT SYSTEMS PROBABLY LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A PROJECT- THE BENEFITS MODERNIZATION SYSTEM. AND IT WILL BE IDENTITY- VERIFICATION WITHIN THAT- THE BSM PROJECTS SO WE ANTICIPATE USING IDENTITY VERIFICATION WHETHER OR NOT. YOU KNOW HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK I MEAN IS IT IS YOU KNOW PROBABLY A COUPLE OF YEARS A WAY FOR US TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT THE NEW SYSTEM. BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE IDENTITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM YES. ANSWERS TO FOLLOW UP SEVENTY TWO IS THE DIAZ ANTICIPATED MOBILE MOST ARE ALL OF YOUR DENTURE VERIFICATION WILL TAKE PLACE. ONLINE OR THROUGH AUTOMATED PROCESSES ISSUE OR- DO WILL WE GO BACK TO SOMETHING. HYBRID OR SOMETHING LIKE LIKE I HAVE EVERY DAY EVERY TIME I GO TO THE AIRPORT WE HAVE TO TAKE MY MASK OFF AS I GO THROUGH NORTH THX. WE ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN OUR OFFICES AYE I THINK ACTUALLY IT TEAM IS MEETING. TOMORROW MORNING TO TALK ABOUT THAT SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE EXPLORING WE- AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AND I ONLY CAME TO EDT DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT- AS I UNDERSTAND IT I'M I'M I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE WERE DOING THAT IN THE OFFICES BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EXPLORE FOR PEOPLE THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT BRINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO CALL AND YOU KNOW AND THERE MAY BE ARGUMETS FOR DELIBERATELY- INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE IN PERSON WOULD SAY THAT. TO THE EXTENT YOU DO. THAT YOU REDUCE THE LIKELY IT OF ALL FRONT. AB THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS CENTER GROVE I'M THINKING CHAIR I ASK ONLY TO IN WE GOT INTO THIS IDEA WHICH I WASN'T AWARE OF- SO THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT I'D IKE TO START WITH IS THAT- MY UNDERSTANDING IN THE EDM INSTRUCTED TO EDT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS ROUGHLY- BASED ON THE AGENDA AT SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO BACK LIKELY CASES. OF PAYMENTS- THAT ARE ROUGHLY SIXTEEN WEEKS OUTPERFORMANCE- NOT PAID AT OR DELAYED I THINK THAT NUMBER IS DOWN TO AROUND SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED NOW AS OF TODAY IS THAT STILL AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF DELAYED PAYMENTS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE APPLIED FOR BENEFITS THAT ARE OUT- FOUR MINUTES. SIXTEEN WEEKS. I BELIEVE SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DEFER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TO RESPOND SPECIFICALLY TO THAT QUESTION. HI GOOD MORNING THIS YEAR WITH EDM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FRENCH DEPUTY DIRECTOR- I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS- THERE'S A CUT. TWO DIFFERENT KIND OF COHORTS OR OR AVENUES OF DETERMINATION WORKLOAD THAT WE HAVE GOING ON WE HAVE OUR- OUR CURRENT EFFORT THAT WE HAVE AS FAR AS PROSPECTIVE DETERMINATIONS THAT WE PRESUMED- AS OF JANUARY OF LAST YEAR. AND THAT INCLUDES- PRIORITIZING- THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS I'M AND SO THOSE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE PRIORITISED TO ENSURE THAT THE- RECEIVE TIMELY ADJUDICATION OR OR AS QUICK AS AND AT THE EDUCATION AS WE CAN. TO CONDUCT DETERMINATION INTERVIEWS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE THAT AE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS THESE ARE TYPICALLY ELIGIBILITY ISSUES WHERE INDIVIDUALS HAVE EITHER I'M SEPARATED WHERE THEY INDICATED THAT THEY VOLUNTARILY QUIT OR THEY WERE TERMINATED FROM THEIR EMPLOYMENT. OR INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT DID NOT REPORT WAGE INFORMATION DURING THE TIME IN WHICH THE PANDEMIC THEY HAVE THE COURAGE AND THEY WERE CERTIFYING AND DID NOT PROVIDE OR DISCLOSE THAT WAGE INFORMATION WHEN THEY WERE CERTIFYING. THEIR BI WEEKLY CERTIFICATION THE WAITING TIME FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT- ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS IT'S SEVEN TO SIXTEEN WEEKS IT IS A RANGE BECAUSE WE ARE PRIORITIZING THAT GROUP- AND I BELIEVE THE ANSWER THE QUESTION SPECIFIC TO. IT DEAD THANK YOU MA'AM. I HAVE A DOCK HERE THAT SAYS THAT- TOTAL NUMBER OF- UNEMPLOYMENT OR SKEWS ME THE ONES THAT WERE TO IMPLEMENT DEVELOP APARTMENT. OF EMPLOYEE. EMPLOYEES IS FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOREIGN TWENTY ONE- PROVIDING ALL THOSE POSITIONS ARE FILLED AND IN THAT FIFTY I'M SORRY IT'S REALLY SMALL FIFTY NINE TWENTY CATEGORY WHICH IS. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS WHICH THESE BACKLOGS WOULD BE ADDRESSED IN OUR CLAIMS TO BE FILED AND- THERE'S FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE EMPLOYEES- IN THAT. AREA IS THAT TRUE. IS THE DOCUMENT I HAVE TRUE. SENATOR NANCY VARIOUS WITH EDT I I'M NOT SURE THAT WE COULD ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION BUT- IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VACANCY RATE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT NO I MEDICINE THANK YOU MYSTERIES FOR DIRECTORS FOR DOING THAT- AND RESPONDING I'M IT'S SO BASED ON THE INFORMATION I HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN OR SIXTY FIVE EMPLOYEES EXISTED IN THE PROCESSING OF BENEFITS AND CLAIMS. THAT SO IN THERE'S OTHER EACH THAT'S ONLY THIRTY OR WORK FORCE BUT IT'S IN THIS AREA BUT THEY'RE STILL SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN- PROCESSOR SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO BUT IT'S THE INORMATION I HAVE IS A COUPLE OF WEEKS OLD. IF AND ALL THE BEST DEAL WITH THOSE PHONE CALLS I DON'T KNOW ONE LEGISLATOR THAT DOES NOT DEAL WITH PHONE CALLS IN THEIR OFFICE ABOUT PROCESS SENIOR WAITING OR DELAYED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS HAVE STEPPED IT UP. A 1000% I KNOW THAT. WITH WHAT YOU TOOK ON DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH- FRIED ADMINISTERING BENEFITS. GETTING CASE WORK DONE. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY WHAT YOU HAVE OVERCOME. AND SO I IT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND GIVING US AN INDIVIDUAL IN OUR OFFICES SO THAT WE COULD WORK DIRECTLY WITH YOU TO SOLVE CLAIMS FOR CONSTITUENTS WAS VERY HELPFUL AS WELL. BUT I HAVEN'T MY CONCERN IS THAT. I GUESS MY SOLUTION OR I HAVE IS IF YOU TOOK THESEFIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HER SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE. THAT YOU HAVE A NEW SET ASIDE ONE DAY JUST ONE DAY. YOU COULD PROBABLY ELIMINATE THOSE THAT ENTIRE BACKLOG OF CASES FOR THAT AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING UP TO FOUR MONTHS FOR THEIR BENEFITS OR DETERMINE THEM INELIGIBLE. SO THAT THEY DIDN'T GET BENEFITS SOMEWHERE ON THE WAITING LIST AND FRANKLY WE'RE CALLING OUR OFFICE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT YOUR DEPARTMENT. LATER NEEDS MEETING VARIOUS WITH EDT- FIRST AND FOREMOST I I'D I WANT TO AGAIN THANK THE STAFF- IN ALL OF YOUR OFFICES FOR THE- HELP. QUITE FRANKLY THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN TO EDT- THEY'VE HELPED YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND WE WERE HAPPY TO- YOU KNOW PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN YOUR OFFICES- THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW WE WILL WE- ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT TRUST ME BECAUSE- WE WANT TO HELP YOU AS MUCH AS YOU ARE HELPING US- AS FAR AS- I THINK I UNDERSTAND. YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING- THE ISSUE WITH THE FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN. HUNDRED ODD STAFF THAT ARE IN YOU WHY IS THERE NOT ALL AT THE SAME. LEVEL OF- THE WORK THAT THEY CAN DO SO THERE ARE THERE ARE DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS. AND CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS CAN DO CERTAIN WORK AND CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS CAN'T- ALSO NOT ALL OF THE ISSUES ARE- YOU AYE RELATED SOME OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY I. T. RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RELATED- AND SO. I DO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- EVERY PERSON CAN WORK ON. YOU KNOW ONE CASE AND WE WOULD BE DONE WHAT DOES THAT THAT BACKLOG AND IT IS A IT'S A- CONTINUAL. YOU KNOW BACKLOG THERE'S ALWAYS- SOME PEOPLE. THAT ARE BEHIND ON TWENTY ONE DAYS. YES I AM THAT AND I AREA. THAT YOUR RESPONSE AND I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THAT I HAD MY SECOND QUESTION THAT I PLANNED ON ASKING TODAY IS- WITH THE DISABILITY INSURANCE CLAIMS THERE'S ROUGHLY- THERE'S FRAUD GOING ON AND THERE'S AS WELL IT'S NOT AS LARGE AS THE U. I. FRAUD IT'S THEIR- BUT- THERE'RE SOME LEGITIMATE DISABILITY CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN FROZEN AGAIN- YOU AYE CLAIMS ARE 1100% FUNDED BY THE EMPLOYER DISABILITY CLAIMS ARE ONE. ARE OFFENDED BY THE EMPLOYEE. CAN PROCESSES ARE WITH STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DISABILITY. CLAIMS AND CLAIMS FOR DISABLED INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING PROCESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER. SURE NAY I NEED TO VARIOUS WITH EDT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE REDIRECTED- STAFF- FROM OTHER BRANCHES IN EDT MUCH LIKE WE DID WITH YOU I. TO HELP WITH THE- BACKLOG IN D. I. IT ZERO POINT SENATOR- AND THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING- WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSONS AND- THE FRAUD IS NOT NEARLY. AS LARGE AS IT WAS IN THE U. I PROGRAM DRAW THE PANDEMIC WE CAUGHT IT VERY EARLY THANKS TO- YOU KNOW GOOD STAFFING AND A PROCESS SEESTHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE BUT WE HAVE RE DIRECTED STAFF AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- AND I THIS WAS. REPORTED I BELIEVE LAST WEEK ON- DONE BY WEEKLY LEGISLATIVE CALL THAT THE NUMBER OF CALLS ARE GOING DOWN THE NUMBER OF- MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND CLAIMANTS THAT- ARE GETTING THROUGH ARE INCREASING- BUT- TO YOUR POINT. MOST OF THIS WAS FRAUD TO SO THERE IS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT VERIFIED THEIR IDENTITY- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE FRAUDULENT BASED ON HISTORICAL. NUMBERS AND DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN. IS THERE ANY YOU KNOW HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTION NOW BECAUSE I KNOW THE CHAIRS AND A VERY- TIGHT TIME CONSTRAINT BUT IS THERE A DOCUMENT THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE MY OFFICE THAT WOULD GIVE ME THE PERCENTAGE OF APPLICANT FRAUD. FOR APPLICATIONS THE PERCENTAGE OF- FRAUDULENT CLAIMS THAT WERE PAID I MEAN I JUST LIKE TO SEE NUMBERS AND PERCENT IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT TO ME OFFLINE I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- TO MY OFFICE. AND THOSE ARE THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT I WANTED TO ASK AND MAKE SURE GO TO ANSWER TO BUT NOW THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS ID MEETING. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IT WAS DETERMINED EARLIER STATED EARLIER THAT THEIR- EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND- ALL OF THAT WEEK- FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES- TO BE WELL VERSED STAFF TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE THE DIVERSE POPULATION THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IS IT MADE KNOWN- CLEARLY- TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS- THE ENGLISH IS NOT THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE BUT IS IT MADE KNOWN TO THOSE OTHER FIVE LANGUAGES THAT THEY ARE BEING IDENTIFIED BY FACIAL RECOGNITION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN BENEFITS FROM THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. DID THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT AND IF SO WHAT'S THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT- COULD YOU ASK THAT AGAIN I'M- SO THERE'S FIVE LANGUAGES THAT WE FOCUS ON TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE LANGUAGE IN DIVERSE POPULATION. HAS THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH STATE AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY YOURS. IS IT MADE CLEAR TO THESE INDIVIDUALS SPECIFICALLY THOSE IN THE FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. M. THAT WHEN THEY UPLOAD THEIR SELFIE THEY ARE THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TO IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE. YES YES THANK YOU NANCY VARIOUS WITH EDS I DEEM ME ALSO- OPERATE IN I BELIEVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OTHER LANGUAGES POSSIBLY EVEN MORE MADE THE CHAU MATE MAY HAVE A OF MORE- NUMBER SH BUT STILL YES THEY THEY CAN THEY- CAN- VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY IN OTHER LANGUAGES AND OF COURSE WE ALSO HAVE- OTHER LANGUAGES AVAILABLE FOR THE APPLICATION PROCESS. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT MY QUESTION I'M ASKING YOU IF- SO LET'S PICK A LANGUAGE- GIVE ME A LANGUAGE WHAT'S ONE OF THE FIVE LANGUAGES SPANISH. SURE OKAY SO DOES THIS THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO- HAS LIMITED ENGLISH OR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND SPEAKS PRIMARILY SPANISH DOES THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO IS APPLYING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WHEN THEY FILL OUT THE APPLICATION AND THEY UPLOAD THEIR SELFIE BECAUSE THEY TAKE A PICTURE THAT'S HOW YOU IDENTIFY THEM IS THAT. THAT INDIVIDUAL. DOES THAT INDIVIDUAL CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE IDENTIFYING THEM. THROUGH FACIAL RECOGNITION OR DO THEY THINK THEY'RE JUST UPLOADING A SELFIE SO YOU COULD SAY OH THAT'S EASY OR WHATEVER. DO THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE USING THAT PHOTO FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION THE APPLICANT. AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M NOT SURE IF THE CIA CHAU KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THAT- I I'M NOT SURE. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN GOOD MORNING IT'S JUST READ ABOUT THE BEAT SO- ID ME HAS SEVEN ADDITIONAL ACT LANGUAGES IN ADDITION TO ENGLISH AND SPANISH- LIKE ABOUT LOVE THAT TWO FORMS OF CHINESE. AND ALL THOSE AND THEIR INSTRUCTION MATCHES FOR THOSE LANGUAGES INSTRUCTION MAC MATCHES THE SAME AS THE ENGLISH AND SPANISH SO- WHATEVER TO INSTRUCTIONS ARE IN ENGLISH IT'S THE SAME THING AS- SEVEN LANGUAGES. BUT THEY ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL- PORT FOR YOUR TRUSTED REFEREED TO HAVE MORE LANGUAGES THAT COULD PROVIDE THAT THE SAME SAME INSPECTION. IS SO YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTION IF I AM A TO GAULLIST SPEAKING INDIVIDUAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I FILL OUT A APPLICATION FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN DEEMED NONESSENTIAL BY THE RESPONSE OR- NOT ESSENTIAL AS A WORKER. AND I APPLY FOR BENEFITS AND I SPEAK TO GAULA. AND I TAKE A PICTURE OF MYSELF BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE APPLICATION INTERCALL INSTRUCTS ME TO DO TO SEND TO YOU OR SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF. DO I HAVE A CLEAR TO I READ A COMMENT THIS SAYS THIS PHOTO WILL BE USED FOR FACIAL ID OR FACIAL RECOGNITION. DO I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S A STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. BY THE EDT. FOR THEIR CONDO. FELLOW- ARE THAT FENDER THE WHEN THEY AFTER THE PHOTO DON'T COME TO AYE ET. IT'S THE PROCEDURE THAT RIGHT AND ASK AND THE AT THE OUT TWENTY TO PREPARE CLAIM ACT NOW. WHEN THEY GET INTO AYE ME- SO. FOR ANY. WHY THEY GET IN EATING THE ONLY. ENGLISH AND SPANISH AT THIS TIME SELL BUT WE DON'T DO THAT THAT THAT THAT THE UPLOAD OF THE PICTURE IS NOT IN THE EDT WEBSITE IT'S IN B. B. ID ME WEBSITE SO ANY TERMS AND CONDITIONS. OF ID NEED IT'S PRESENTED WITH THE POTENTIAL CLAIM THAT WHEN THEY DO THEY'RE THEY'RE VERIFYING YOUR IDENTITY IS IN THE ID ME WHAT'S WEBSITE. AND INSTRUCTIONS HE'S SPLITTING HAIRS WHEN AND THAT'S I'M SORRY BUT YOU'RE SPLITTING HAIRS. SO YOU HAVE A CONTRACTOR THE STANCES OF HIS ONE MORE ONE MORE TIME AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON AND MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A- SECURE LINE WINNING HERE'S- OKAY I APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING IT GOES TO THE EIGHTY D. BDD EMPLOYEES A CONTRACTOR. THAT CONTRACTOR PROVIDES BENEFITS OR OR APPLICATION PROCESSES OR WHATEVER. EVEN IF THAT'S INCORRECT. I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE IS. WE SOMEBODY WHO SPEAKS TO GOLF OR A OF THOSE EITHER SO LINK. AND THEY TAKE A SELFIE AS AN APPLICATION PROCESS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO FURTHER NO LONGER WORKING. DOES THAT INDIVIDUAL CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THEY SUBMIT THAT PHOTO TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR OR THE CONTRACTOR. FOR EDIE D. THEY ARE GOING TO USE THAT FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION AGAINST SOME LARGER MORE EXPANSIVE DATABASE. SENATOR NEED THE VERY SPEEDY I THINK I SO. IT HAS BEEN AWHILE SINCE I HAVE GONE THROUGH I. DV BUT THERE IS A BOX THAT YOU CHECK- THAT SAYS THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW THAT I. D. ME CAN USE YOUR INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW EXCEPT ARE UP FOR THE PURPOSES OF WHITE- YOU'RE GOING TO ID NEED FOR. AND SO I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS THAT ALSO IN OTHER LANGUAGES TO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- IN OTHER LANGUAGES THAT THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THAT YOUR QUESTION. IS YES AND THAT'S IT AND THEN I HAVE TO JUMP IN THE ANSWER YES. THAT'S THE AND THAT'S HOW. YOU ALWAYS ANSWER STAND OKAY. YES YES WE GOT IT GOING. I SUCKS SO IT THAT MIGHT BE IN IS I DO KNOW I GOING TO ASSUME. THAT WHEN THEY TRANSLATE THE WEBSITE IT IS TRANSLATED INTO THE OTHER LANGUAGES AND THAT IS STILL- AN OPTION TO CHECK THE BOX YES OKAY MY LAST WE'RE GONNA. RUN THIS IS S THESE CONTRACTS FOR THESE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS ARE CONTRACTORS THAT EDIE YOU ADD USES. IS THERE A- IS THERE A SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION NOTICE CAN BE CANCELED- IMMEDIATELY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS- OR IS THERE A PENALTY FOR CANCELLATION ON AN EARLY CANCELLATION NOTICE. I WILL DEFER TO THIS CHAU ON THAT IDB CONTRACT WE DO HAVE A PREPAID- UP OF FOUR FORTY I DO NEED BUT WE CAN CANCEL THE SERVICE- WITHIN A CERTAIN LIMIT OF TIME I AFFECT LET THEM KNOW THAT THAT WE'RE CANCELLING THE CONTRACT.

LIKE TO CALM. GOOD AFTERNOON CELLO ONLY BRIEFLY- WITH RESPECT TO THE FOR I- OF THIS. GROUP GRANTS- OR HELP IN AN- SOCIAL SECTORS ARE PART OF THEIR THE CARAVAN A PACKAGE I MENTIONED- EARLIER- I WILL BE WERE A BROADER. I ON THE CARE COMING BUT DON'T OUT THAT ET GRANTS HAVE HAVE I THINK OF SAN AND ALLOW. SEVERAL BUDGETS- MORE THAN DOUBLING- THERE THERE'S FOR LONG TRADITIONAL MOUNT AND WE PUT OUT THAT WHAT IS IT YOU'RE GOING TO. ENSURE THAT EIGHTY EIGHTY P. HAS A CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER THE GRANTS- EVIDENTIAL REVIEW THE- QUALIFICATIONS ABOUT- ONGOING REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS WHO WHO DO RECEIVE ATP GRANT POLITICS- BUT NO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS JUST HIGHLIGHTS. THANKS THANK YOU FOR MUCH- WITH FINANCE LIKE TO COMMON. I UP IN THE MODIFY NO ADDITIONAL AT THIS TIME THANK YOU HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- I DO HAVE ACTUALLY A FEW QUESTIONS WANT FOR DEEP OF FINE. CAN YOU WHY THE TRAINING PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED ARE UNDER THE EDT AS OPPOSED TO- THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. I FEDERAL JOB IN THE FARMER TO FINANCE THANK YOU CHAIR- SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN TWO PARTS OF THIS ONE FIRST IS THE ATP WHICH IS. ITSELF A TRAINING ANY THAT OPERATES BUDGETARY EARLY UNDERNEATH. INCLEMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WOULD SORT OF WE HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE THAT EIGHTY THEIR PROPERTY IMPLEMENTATION ENTITY. THE EMT AND OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF EDIE'S WORKS ARE WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH THAT CURRENTLY MINISTERS. BROWN SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING EVERY YEAR HAS A DEMONSTRATED CAPACITY TO PROCURE FUNDS AND- EVALUATE- AS WELL AS CONDUCT TITLE ONE OVERSIGHT OF WE- SO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE QUESTIONING THAT I WAS QUESTIONING ASKING SINCE WE HAD ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS. FROM THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND FRANKLY I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE DUPLICATES SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY HAVE A DUPLICATE FONG- PROGRAM UNDER ET DE OR EIGHTY P. WE JUST WENT THROUGH A WHOLE PRESENTATION OF THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THE- HEALTH AND SOCIAL WORK. THE OF FUND FOR OIL AND GAS WORKERS- THE INTEGRATED EDUCATION OUR TRAINING ALL OF THESE WERE JUST WE JUST WENT THROUGH THESE AND THE- LABOR ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WHAT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE PROGRAMS. I CHAIR- PETRA TOP AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SORT OF I THINK YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO THE OVERVIEW THAT THE LABOR AGENCY GAVE BEFOREHAND WHICH INCLUDED THESE BUT ARE NOT BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IS AGENCY DOES NOT IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD FALL TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE E. D. I WOULD DEFER TO MY LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING. LIKE THAT. WHO'S GONNA ANSWER THAT WELL IF I MAY JUST ADD- IF YOU RECALL EARLIER. THIS NAY GIVEN OVERVIEW OF THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGING INVESTMENTS WHICH TO CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- AS PATRICK STATED. OUR OVERUSE SHE COVERED SOME OF THE. INVESTMENT STATE HEALTH. AND WE FOR THE SEASON FALL WITH A- THAT FRAMEWORK SHE PROVIDED AND THEY ARE EACH DISTINCT. YEAH ARMED IF WE COULD PERHAPS FOLLOW UP AND PROVIDE FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN EACH OF THIS INVESTMENTS BUT THEY ARE WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THAT WOMEN TRAINING PANEL COVERED ONE REGARDING THE EMIGRATE WORKFORCE THAT WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON WORKERS INCUMBENT WORKERS WORKERS THAT ARE. ACTUALLY EMPLOYED ALREADY UPGRADE GOVERNMENT SAW- THE ONE I DESCRIBED IS MORE BROAD IT'S TO EXPAND. EVERY SPECIFIC- PROGRAM- THAT WOULD. I EXPAND ON A MOM OF DEGREE THAT WOULD TRADITIONALLY A BEEN AND TRAINING TO DO THAT AND SPECIFIC TRAINING AND THAT WOULD BE BROADER TO THE PUBLIC MIND THOSE THAT ARE PUBLIC. UNDERPLAY SAID THAT I JUST GIVE BAD AND EXAMPLE TOOLS. THE DISTINCTION OF THE COMMISSION BY. YEAH AND THIS IS ABBY WITH THE EACH I FOLLOW UP ON HOW THE REMAIN. COMMENTS ON AS I DID DESCRIBE EARLY. THESE ARE THREE AND AROUND HOW. AROUND CLIMATE- AROUND IMMIGRANT INTO WHICH ON IN WHICH EACH OF THE- IN TAKING P. THE WORK FOR DEVELOP BOARD ON WILL ADMINISTER. IMPENDING- SPECIFIC PROBE ALUM AND ARE JUST TO- COORDINATE TO REFERRAL TO COP EACH OTHER- IS JUST PART OF THE INCREASING THE OF. COORDINATION TO GET PEOPLE INTO GOOD AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY SO THE WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER WHEN THOSE UNDER THE LABOR WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT. UNDER THE LARGER UMBRELLA BUT THE DIRECTED MINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM'S GOES TO ANY OF THESE WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THE OIL WORKERS- THE TERMINOLOGY THAT'S USED HERE IS REALLY DIFFERENT SOCKS USE ME FOR IF I GOT THESE CONFUSED BUT THIS DESCRIBES IT AS DISPLACED BROWN DISSIPATED- ONCE WORD SAYS ACTUALLY DISPLACED. THE OTHER WORDS ARE ANTICIPATED DISPLACEMENT- AND THOSE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT WE HEARD EARLIER BY MISTER RANEY IS THE PROCESS OF OKAY AS THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO CAP THE OIL WELLS THAT THERE WILL BE A TRANSITION FOR THOSE AND WORKERS OF BRUCE'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE DISPLACED AND SO LET'S GIVE HIM SOME MONEY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT- DOES THE- HIGH ROW TRAINING PARTNERSHIP DO THOSE ELEMENTS APPLY TO ALL OF THESE AS WELL. HAVE YOUR DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. SURE YES- SELECTED THE ONE THAT MISTER RANEY WAS DESCRIBING EARLIER WAS VERY SPECIFIC TO A PILOT FOR OIL CAFFEINE AND WHICH WE WILL BE SEEKING ACTUALLY PLACE PEOPLE INTO THOSE POSITIONS- ARM THE FINE THAT I DESCRIBE AS DISPLACED WORKER FIND IS A FUND CREATED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF WORKERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY DISPLACED FROM AN INDUSTRY AND THAT IN THE FUTURE WE ANTICIPATE THE TREND TO CONTINUE UNTIL WE CONTINUE OUR ONGOING THE SPACE JUST RIGHT INDUSTRY AND THIS FUND WILL BE CREATED TO HELP THOSE WORKERS. AND THAT CAP AND TRADE WILL BE OPTION FOR MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE BUT ALSO OUR FUNDING WILL ACT FINE OTHERS- GRANTS THAT WILL SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD HELP THESE WORKERS FIND NEW CAREERS. IN OTHER SECTORS AND INDUSTRIES APPEAR APPEAR TO BE DISK I MEAN I DON'T UNDER WHY THEY AND DO. DEPARTMENTS BRUCE'S THERE IN ONE PLACE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL GOING TO COMPREHENSIVELY PROVIDE FOR THOSE WORKERS AND YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE'RE ALREADY DECIDING THAT THEY WILL BE DISPLACED WHEN OUR WHEN OUR GOAL IS SAID TO BE THEY WILL NOT BE DISPLACED THEY WILL BE TRANSITIONED- AND PROVIDED FOR THE TRAINING OF THEY NEED WHICH APPEARS TO BE VERY LITTLE- TO GO INTO THESE NEW INTO THESE NEW SECTORS INTO THESE NEW JOBS SO. THAT PART MAKES ME YOU KNOW UNCOMFORTABLE TO DECLARE THAT THERE WILL BE DISPLACED WORKERS WE ARE HAVE WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE JOBS AS A PLACE FOR THOSE WORKERS TO GO INTO NOT AS THEY'RE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT THERE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM YOU KNOW SOME SOME MONEY SO THAT'S MY QUESTION THERE ON THE ATP ON THE- TARGETED TRAINING FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS I READ THE MODEL THAT WAS BEING USED AND WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THE MODEL HAS THERE'S A TRAINING STIPEND OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH- SO THAT PARTICIPANTS CAN FOCUS ON TRAINING. WITHOUT PART TIME OR FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. I KNOW THAT THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF MODEL WE WANT TO USE BECAUSE A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS NOT GOING TO PAY THE BILLS. EVERY EXPECTED TO DO THE TRAINING WITHOUT- BEING ABLE TO WORK SO JUST TO COMMENT ON THAT I DON'T NEED A RESPONSE IS NOT A QUESTION- MEMBERS QUESTIONS. YES SENATOR NEWMAN. RETURNED AND FOR PUTTING MYSTERY MERYL OR SOMEBODY LIKE QUESTION ON. THE ATP COMPONENT RIGHT SO NINE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY. SIMPLY REGIONALLY BIG SOME OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TRAINING CAN BE DONE EITHER IN HOUSE. OR BY A THIRD PARTY AND STRIKE BACK MIGHT MAKE QUESTIONS ARE. DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE- TO VISION CAPACITY IN OR THERE ARE ARE THERE. EXISTING TRAINING PROVIDERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND I GUESS AS PART OF THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE SERVICE STANDARD FOR QUICKER FOR PARTICIPATION. OF COURSE CERTIFICATION TO DO THAT. I CAN ANSWER QUESTION FOR THE RECORD THIS IS DIANA TORSION THE PLAN TRAINING PANEL CURRENTLY JUST TO CLARIFY A WITH REGARDS TO ANY HOUSE THE TRAINING IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED BY EITHER THE EMPLOYER THEMSELVES BY THEIR IN HOUSE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. OR THEY CAN APPROACH YOUR THIRD PARTY TRAINING ENDORS WE ALSO CONTRACTOR ACTUALLY WITHOUT A POINT WHERE CONTRACTORS WHO ARE TRAINING AGENCIES OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO IT'S NOT E. G. P. THE PROVIDES THE TRAINING I'M NOT SURE OF THAT I WAS ABLE TO CLARIFY HIS DATE I MEAN THAT WAS CLEAR BUT SERVICE TO WHAT'S WHAT'S- WHAT'S THE STANDARD FOR PARTICIPATION. BY YOU KNOW BY WAY OF QUALIFICATION VACATION FOR A THIRD PARTY PROVIDER AND ARE THERE SITUATION NUMBER RIGHT NOW. TO MEET THE DEMAND THAT THIS WILL CREATE. EXCELLENT WHAT DO HAVE TRAINING H. SIR. SUCH AS THE BURKE- THE- SECOND AS WELL FOR COMMITTEE IS OBVIOUS WE HAVE NECESSARY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRAINER'S. CREATURE THAT'S RIGHT I GUESS- THE PROVISION RIGHT HERE ALLOWS FOR EXTENDED PERIOD FOR A CONFERENCE SO THIS IS A FIVE YEAR CYCLE IS A IS THAT CORRECT. AND AGAIN I GUESS I'D LOVE TO LEARN MORE WE DON'T DO IT NOW ABOUT THROUGH THE G. P. MODEL JUST YOU KNOW BE MORE GENERALLY- AND THE COMMUNITY OF TRAINERS- AND FULLY QUALIFIED PARTICIPANTS- BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE OTHERS ARE FAIRLY TECHNICAL AREAS SO THAT- YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS THAT. EITHER WERE NOT READY TO DO THIS QUICKLY- OR IT WILL TAKE LONG ENOUGH. TO FIND TRAINERS FOR BY GESS THE CONGRESS IS THAT WE WILL HAVE. SURGERY TO SEE THAT WE WON'T HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY TRAINING SO- I GUESS IT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT AGAIN ALLOW REACH OUT AT LIKE LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS. I JUST WANT TO COUPLE RELATED FOLLOW- IS ETP. ARE REQUIRING JOB AND WAGE COMMITMENTS UP FRONT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THESE. JOBS THAT THEIR- TRAINEES ARE GOING TO WILL BE GOOD JOBS AND- WHAT INFORMATION IS IT DOES ETP REQUIRE CONTRACTORS TO SUBMIT. AND IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. YES I CAN ANSWER THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE JOBS UP FRONT YES EGP ALWAYS REQUIRES THE JOBS UP FRONT AND UP AS WELL AS WE ARE ACTUALLY VERY POSITIONS WITH OUR NEW SYSTEMS. CHIU REQUIRE AND ASKED FOR THE CURRENT WAGES OF THOSE- TRAINING PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS THE WAGES AT THE END OF THEIR NINETY DAY RETENTION PERIOD OR A SPECIFIC RETENTION PERIOD BASED ON THE TYPE OF OCCUPATION. AND IS THAT INFORMATION- THE- THAT CONTRACTORS ARE THEY REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THAT AND IS IT PUBLIC. I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION MARK ABOUT SLICK FROM EGP AS PART OF OUR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THE CONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE WAGE INFORMATION- ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS ARE BEING TRAINED AND THEIR TRAINING CLASS- THAT ALL GETS PUT INTO A PROPOSAL THAT GOES INTO- IN FRONT OF OUR PANEL AND WE PUBLISH. THOSE PROPOSALS ONLINE- WE WITHHOLD CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT'S PROPRIETARY TO THE COMPANIES- THEN ONCE THE CONTRACT IS EXECUTED WHERE TRACKING ON AN INDIVIDUAL TRAINEE LEVEL- WE'RE WE'RE GETTING- YOU KNOW DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION THINGS LIKE THAT- FOR THAT ALL OF THAT IS IN OUR NEW- A NEW KILEY FOR SYSTEM BASED ON SALES FORCE WHICH ALL PROTECTED AND- ENCRYPTED. ALSO THE- BASICALLY PRO PRIVATE THE PRIVATE INFORMATION IS NOT SHARED WITH ANYONE THAT CAN'T BE SHARED. I'M SORRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. IT IF THIS IS A PUBLIC CONTRACT WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING WITHHELD. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IT'S- BASICALLY INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IF THEY'RE COLLECTED WHICH WE DO COLLECTED ENROLLMENT FOR. ATTENTION VERIFICATION PURPOSES- JUST BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRAINEES THEIR NAMES THINGS LIKE THAT IF EVER WE'RE SHARING DATA WHERE WE HAVE TO SCRUB THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION SO THAT IT'S NOT SHARED- THEN IN AGGREGATE WE DO REPORTED YEARLY- IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT WE PROVIDE A REPORT OF HOW WE DID ESSENTIALLY DURING THE LAST YEAR ACROSS ALL OF OUR PROJECTS AND ALL OF OUR CONTRACTS AND- WE DO A PRESENTATION FOR A PENALTY WHICH OF COURSE- YOU'RE ALL WELCOME TO COME WE'RE ABOUT TO DO ONE- IN A MONTH OR TWO- JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE- ONE SIMPLE POINT. ON AVERAGE AS YOU'VE HEARD- OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR I MAKE IT SURE IS STATE. ON AVERAGE WE TRAIN ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND TRAINEES PER YEAR- AND OUR AVERAGE WAGE ACROSS OUR ENTIRE PROGRAM. ENDS UP BEING OVER THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR SO THESE ARE GOOD QUALITY OF GOOD QUALITY TRAINING THAT'S RESULTING IN HIGHER WAGES. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER GROVE PLEASE THANK YOU MR GET RIGHT STRAIGHT INTO THE QUESTION OKAY THANK YOU I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE DIRECTED TO YOU AND THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING IN ADVANCE SO THE INFORMATION I HAVE ON THE AGENDA SAYS THAT- THE DISPLACING OIL PULLING GAS WORKERS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO ESTABLISH AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR OIL AND GAS WORKERS. FACING AN ANTICIPATED DISPLACEMENT DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY WOULD IT WAS AN ANTICIPATED DISPLACEMENT TREND WITH THIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE WILL BE DISPLACEMENT SETBACK IN ABOUT INDUSTRY THE STOCK WAS ADVANCED UNDER CONSTANT OKAY M. THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT THESE WORKERS FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM ROUGHLY MAKE A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. DID YOU. DO YOU THINK THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES THEIR WAGE LOSS WITH THE LACK OF PERMITS AND EVERYTHING BEING ISSUES AND JOB AT PEOPLE BEING DISPLACED NOW. TODAY WITHOUT RIGS GOING UP DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND FOR THIS. UNANTICIPATED DISPLACEMENT. IN YOUR ORDER GOVERNOR'S WORDS AND IS ADEQUATE FOR THESE WORKERS. IT'S INTENDED TO BE A PART OF THE ARM AND WE HOPE TO LEARN FROM THE LEVEL OF NEED. FROM THIS POPULATION IN THIS INDUSTRY AND AS WE GET ACQUIRED THAT INFORMATION WEWILL REPORT BACK AND WILL CERTAINLY BRING STATE WILSHIRE THE MINISTRATION AND YOURSELVES OKAY OKAY APPRECIATE I MEAN I STILL HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS MISS MADAM CHAIR. AND SO JUST SO YOU KNOW. I FEEL LIKE AGAINST FREELY FOR MINE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OIL FIELD WORKER CONSTITUENTS. THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THEIR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEIR BENEFITS. INSTEAD OF GOING TO WHATEVER FOOD LINE YOU EXPECT THEM TO GO TO FOR HOUSING GROCERIES AND CHILD CARE. WHICH YOU MENTIONED. AND SO IN A IT'S HOW AND ANTICIPATED DISPLACEMENT THAT YOU ADDRESS OR THE ADMINISTRATION DRESSES BECAUSE YOU'RE PURPOSELY TRYING TO SHUT DOWN THE INDUSTRY AND I STILL CANNOT GET AN ANSWER FROM ANYONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING WORKERS WHICH WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY OR HOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. AT THE NECESSARY OIL THAT IS NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THEN EACH ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS NOT TO MENTION MY CULINARY GROUP ARE I REALLY MASKING YOU TO ASK YOUR DIRECT QUESTION IAN LINERS OUT OF LOS NOT JUST MAKE COMMENTS ASK A DIRECT QUESTION SO THAT THEY COULD BE ANSWERED. WHEN ROUGHLY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OIL FIELD WORKERS ARE DISPLACED NOT ANTICIPATE NOT AN ANTICIPATED BUT ANTICIPATED DISPLACED. WHERE WILL THE ADMINISTRATION. NUMBER ONE PUT THEM. LIKE THE CHAIRS QUESTIONS THERE WILL BE SOME THAT WILL TRANSITION INTO CAPPING WELLS BUT IN SOME INTO CONSTRUCTION AT IN NUMBER TWO- WHERE WILL THIS IS SOMEBODY'S A TELL ME WHERE THIS YEAR THIS OIL IS GONNA COME FROM. I'M SORRY CENTER GROUP THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE BEFORE US HERE THE ISSUE BEFORE US ARE THESE SPECIFIC TRAINING PROGRAMS AND ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE SO THAT WE CAN DECIDE ON THE BUDGET ITEM SO IF THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS HERE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WITH THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE ASKING DEFENDER IRRELEVANT. IF WE DON'T HAVE THE OIL TO TAKE CARE OF THE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL THE CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR I NEED A SPECIFIC QUESTION OR PLEASE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION HOW WILL WE PROVIDE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL WITH PEOPLE THAT DON'T WORK IN THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA FIGURE TRANSITIONING. OUT OF THOSE JOBS INTO EITHER FOOD LINES OR OTHER JOBS. HELLO DO THAT THAT'S NOT A QUESTION BEFORE THAT IS RELEVANT TO THIS ISSUE BEFORE US. SO WE MOVE ON CENTER COURT AS HE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. HE DISAPPOINTED IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE- THE INDUSTRY. REGARDLESS OF THIS COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IS HAS BEEN DECLINING AT ABOUT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT- ANNUALLY AS I UNDERSTAND THE MATERIALS HERE SO THE QUESTION BECOMES- WHAT WE DOING. TO HELP THOSE FOLKS OUT- WELL THAT'S HAPPENING. REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIDE OF THAT ISSUE YOU'RE ON. IN TERMS OF. FOSSIL FUELS. FOUR OR WHATEVER IN A TOTALLY RESPECT THE CONCERN OF. OF SOMEBODY IN THE SENATE WHO REPRESENTS SO MANY OF THOSE WORKERS- HAS THAT LEGISLATORS. BUT I THINK REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS A SAFETY NET. FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHILE IT'S HAPPENING. PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG- BUT I JUST WANTED TO. JUST CLARIFY MY ATTITUDE ABOUT THIS IN THANK YOU AND. AGAIN I RESPECT ALL OF HER COMMENTS. COURSE THANK YOU OKAY- WE BONDS TO. C.
