NICE TO HAVE THAT AVAILABLE- SO

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:36.281
THAT WE'RE NOT FRANTICALLY.

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:37.916
COMPLETING COMPETING WITH OTHER

I'M I PERHAPS GOING TO

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.407
PARTIALLY ADDRESS HOPEFULLY THE

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.075
QUESTIONS OF MY GOOD FRIEND

00:24:04.142 --> 00:24:06.077
FROM BAKER STILL DOESN'T GROW.

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:07.779
UP BECAUSE AS THE AUTHOR WITH

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:09.247
US OUR LABOR OF THE ORIGINAL

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.483
STOCKPILE BUILD. IT DOWN HERE

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.318
IS THAT THE STOCKPILE OBVIOUSLY

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:16.054
IN A LARGE EVENT LIKE COVE IT

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.722
EVEN IN TRYING NEVER GOT WE'RE

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.391
TRYING TO BUILD A STOCKPILE

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:23.228
ENOUGH. TO AVOID THAT HOWEVER.

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:24.262
FOR THE PURPOSES HOUSE ACTUALLY

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:25.997
THE BUFFER IN TO BUY TIME RATES

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:27.532
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:28.900
IN AN IMMEDIATE CRUNCH OF

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.635
COURSE THERE'S VERY LITTLE PP

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:32.804
AVAILABLE SO PRICES GO SKY HIGH

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:34.706
IT'S AN ACCESSIBLE YOU KNOW

00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:35.540
YOU'RE POTENTIALLY AT RISK

00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:37.876
FROM- PREDATORY SELLERS WHO

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:38.977
EITHER DON'T CARRY THROUGH OUR-

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:41.112
SUPPLY SUBSTANDARD PRODUCT. SO

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:43.148
THE IDEA IS THAT THE STOCKPILES

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:44.216
THE SHARES AT LEAST FOR A

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:45.917
PERIOD OF TIME YOU DO HAVE

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:47.953
ACCESS TO. HIGHER COURT YOU

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:52.090
KNOW. TO THE DVD THAT IS. THAT

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:53.725
WAS PURCHASED AT WHEN THINGS

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:54.926
WORK TO ADDRESS SUCH A HIGH

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.828
PRICE ND SO FORTH AND- SO I

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.496
THAT'S HOW I VIEW THE STOCKPILE

00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:01.466
HAPPENING. IS THE OBVIOUSLY IN

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:03.835
A LARGE PANDEMIC SITUATION IT

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:05.937
WOULD BUY SOME TIME ALLOWS YOU

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.405
TO RE ESTABLISH SUPPLIES CHAINS

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:08.373
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.741
IT. I WOULD THINK THAT IN A

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.943
WILDFIRE SITUATION WHERE. THERE

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.045
MAY NOT BE A WORLDWIDE SHORTAGE

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.413
OR EVEN A NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.382
OF PP WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.251
STATE WOULD. MAKE THE STOCKPILE

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.986
OF SALEABLE- THE MAY MAKE

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:23.088
AVAILABLE AT COST- RIGHT SO

00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:24.990
THAT'S A LOWER COST NOT EDDIE

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.591
YOU KNOW A CRUNCH CLASS. BUT

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:28.526
THEN ALSO OF COURSE AS SOON AS

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:30.562
WE'RE ABLE TO. SECURE

00:25:30.629 --> 00:25:32.530
ADDITIONAL PP START PURCHASING

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:36.902
IT IN MASS TO RE- RESTOCK THE

00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:39.371
STOCKPILES RIGHT. HOWEVER IF

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:41.139
IT'S IN A CRUNCH SITUATION AT

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:42.207
LEAST WE BOUGHT SOME TIME SO

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:43.608
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHASE DOWN

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:45.310
AND HAVING TO IMMEDIATELY BITE

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:47.412
BECAUSE OF THE IMMEDIATE NEED-

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.481
PP THAT IS EITHER UNAVALABLE

00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:51.983
OR JUST SKY HIGH PRICES. RIGHT

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.385
SO THAT I THINK IS THE PURPOSE

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:55.086
OF THE STOCKPILE AND THAT

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.087
CERTAINLY WOULD I THINK HELP

00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:57.589
EMPLOYERS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:59.491
LOCAL SORT OF SHORTAGE. THEY'RE

00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:01.393
NOT HAVING TO FIND IT AND THEN

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:02.727
HAVING TO BUY IT WHATEVER PRICE

00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:04.262
I WAS WILLING TO SELL IT FOR

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:05.297
INSTEAD THEY CAN RELY ON THE

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.631
STOCK PILE INTO THE STOCK HOW

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:08.466
CAN BE IS A LARGE PURCHASER.

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:10.435
EVENTUALLY ABLE TO YOU KNOW-

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:11.870
REBUILT YOU KNOW BASICALLY

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.905
RESUME WHEN PRICES HAVE HAVE

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.440
SETTLED OBVIOUSLY WITH A VERY

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:17.542
LARGE OUTBREAK LIKE TELEVISION-

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:18.443
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.045
CHALLENGE BUT- CERTAINLY I

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:24.950
THINK. THAT WE WHAT WE SAW WAS

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:25.583
THAT PEOPLE HAD EVEN HAD THE-

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.785
BE. SUPPLY LINES AND JUST I'LL

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:27.752
BE BUYS THE TO READ. SOME OF

00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:30.655
THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. AT THE TOP

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.090
YES SENATOR GROWTH. YOUR CHAIR

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:34.359
FOR ADDRESSING MY CONCERNS- I

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.760
DID I SAW IT HERE FROM THE

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:37.362
STATE LEVEL AS A LEGISLATOR AND

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.297
AS A BUSINESS OWNER. I ALSO SAW

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:41.132

FIFTY CENTS EACH AND TILL.

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:48.073
COULD HAPPEN AND THEN THEY WERE

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.207
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET YOU

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.141
WERE PAYING FIVE DOLLARS A

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:52.811
PIECE. SO IT WAS AND THAT WAS

00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:54.045
MY CONCERN IS IF WE DEPLETED

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:55.613
THIS BUT I APPRECIATE THE PIECE

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.982
OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK IT'S

00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:59.451

THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:14.564
FACT THIS BILL PUTS LIMITS ON

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.233
THAT- MAYBE NOT LIMITS THAT-

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.836

THAT SOME BILLS LIMITS ARE IN

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:24.741
THE CONTEXT THE FACT THAT THE

BASICALLY THE PEOPLE WHO WANT

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:33.817
TO. BAN THIS ALL TOGETHER

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:36.352
PERHAPS- AND- YOU KNOW THAT

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:37.086
WOULD BE GOING AGAINST THE

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:38.621
CENTURY THE OVERALL WILL OF THE

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:40.023

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:41.057
LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:43.893
ITSELF. SO I THINK THIS IS IN A

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.328
IN A SENSE IS ALSO AN EMERGENCY

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:47.363

VACUUM. UNTIL THE FDA ACTS-

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.678

PROPONENTS. LITTLE BIT OF A

02:06:35.254 --> 02:06:36.989
CONFLICT IF I MAY ALSO

02:06:37.056 --> 02:06:38.190

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.692

AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE ON.

02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:43.562
IT'S CLEAR I MEAN I JUST HEARD

02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:45.597
A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS-

02:06:45.664 --> 02:06:47.700
STRONGLY SUPPORTING YOUR BILL

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:50.169
WHICH IS GREAT AND I ALSO HEARD

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:53.138
FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT. THIS

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:55.040
BILL OR- SOME OTHER PORTIONS OF

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:56.642
THIS BILL MAY BE IN CONFLICT

02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:57.443
WITH THE STATE'S RECYCLING

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.545
GOALS AND AGAIN JUST FOR

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:03.048
CLARITY CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT.

02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:04.149
THANK YOU. RICHARD I DON'T

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:07.519
THINK THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING-

02:07:07.586 --> 02:07:12.124
AGAIN THE MADE IMPETUS FOR THE-

02:07:12.191 --> 02:07:14.059
HE FAST ESPECIALLY IN FOOD

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:17.262
PACKAGING IS. QUITE OFTEN- TO

02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:18.897
SAY IN MY JURISDICTION I'M VERY

02:07:18.964 --> 02:07:21.000
FORTUNATE THAT WE ACTUALLY

02:07:21.066 --> 02:07:23.135
ALLOW FOOD PACKAGING INTO OUR

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:25.404
COMPOST HOWEVER IF THE FOOD

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:27.973
PACKAGING HAS P. FASTER SOME OF

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.975
THESE OTHER- FOREVER CHEMICALS

02:07:30.042 --> 02:07:31.777
ACTUALLY POLLUTES THE COMPASS

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:35.014
SO- AGAIN- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.116
THERE IS A PARTICULAR CONFLICT

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:41.186
WITH OUR STATES- RECYCLING LAWS

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:43.322

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:45.958
MAKE SURE. THAT THESE CHEMICALS

02:07:46.025 --> 02:07:48.660

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:51.630
THE COMPOSTING BUT ALSO DON'T

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:52.865
HARM TO INDIVIDUALS FOR USING

02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:56.101
IT ON THE OTHER PIECE IS MANY

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:59.104

02:07:59.171 --> 02:08:00.873

PURCHASED- NON P. FAST FOOD

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:07.880
PACKAGING IT'S QUITE RANDOM AT

02:08:07.946 --> 02:08:09.148
THE CLUB IT'S BASED ON LOCATION

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:12.217
AND WHICH- WHICH- FOOD

02:47:43.153 --> 02:47:44.888
QUESTION YOU RAISE IS ONE THAT

02:47:44.954 --> 02:47:46.523
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AS

02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:49.626
WELL- THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IN

ACCREDITING PRO PROGRAM. BUT

02:48:09.813 --> 02:48:13.716
IT'S THE DATE THE A AND C. P.

02:48:13.783 --> 02:48:16.853
H. AS WELL THAT THE USUALLY THE

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.822
BOARD ITSELF IS LICENSING THE

02:48:18.888 --> 02:48:20.690
INDIVIDUAL AND NOT THE TRAINING

02:48:20.757 --> 02:48:22.659
PROGRAM SO IN SOME SENSE IS

02:48:22.725 --> 02:48:23.726
THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS IN

02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:25.595
TERMS OF GIVEN THE WAY THE

LEGISLATION THAT WOULD NOT

02:48:37.907 --> 02:48:39.375
DATE WERE TESTIFYING AS WELL

AS- DCA. AND THAT THEY WOULD

02:48:42.612 --> 02:48:48.952
NOT NECESSARILY- BE DIRECTLY-

02:48:49.018 --> 02:48:50.286
BECAUSE THE BLADECENTER'S ABOUT

02:48:50.353 --> 02:48:52.021
THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT PROGRAM

02:48:52.088 --> 02:48:54.357
THAT- THERE ARE SOME LIMITS TO

HOW MUCH THE- THAT IMPACTED

02:48:56.793 --> 02:48:57.961

02:50:21.377 --> 02:50:22.278
CLINICAL PORTION OF THEIR

02:50:22.345 --> 02:50:24.447
STUDIES. I THINK. A LARGE

02:50:24.514 --> 02:50:25.982
PORTION OF THE POPULATION AND

02:50:26.049 --> 02:50:27.116
THE DOES RECRUITMENT TRAINING

02:50:27.183 --> 02:50:28.651
LIKE A CLLEGE IS IN OUR SCHOOL

02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:30.920
SYSTEMS- YOU KNOW BIG. BIG SHOW

02:50:30.987 --> 02:50:32.689
COLLEGE FOR INSTANCE LIKE MANY

02:50:32.755 --> 02:50:33.323
OF THE COLLEGES THAT CALLED IN

02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:34.791
AS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL.

02:50:34.857 --> 02:50:36.125
BECAUSE OF BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE%

02:50:36.192 --> 02:50:36.993
PROGRAM DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:38.728
RESOURCES TO PAY PEOPLE TO GO

02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:39.596
THROUGH THIS RECRUITMENT PART

02:50:39.662 --> 02:50:41.531
OR THIS. TRAINING PROGRAM FOR

02:50:41.598 --> 02:50:43.166
THE CLINICAL PORTION. WHEN

02:50:43.232 --> 02:50:44.100
THEY'RE INTERNING AT THE

02:50:44.167 --> 02:50:47.070
HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEY DO- MY

02:50:47.136 --> 02:50:48.071
DAUGHTER IS A NURSE BUT THEY

02:50:48.137 --> 02:50:49.939
DID TESTING AND TRAINING AT THE

02:50:50.006 --> 02:50:51.107
SCHOOL AND THEN THEY DID

02:50:51.174 --> 02:50:52.041
CLINICAL PORTIONS OF THE

02:50:52.108 --> 02:50:53.810
HOSPITAL IF THEY CAN'T PAY FOR

02:50:53.876 --> 02:50:55.712
THEM TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. OR

02:50:55.778 --> 02:50:57.680
THE EMPLOYER OR THE BENEFITING

02:50:57.747 --> 02:50:59.215
PERSON DOESN'T- ORGANIZATION

02:50:59.282 --> 02:51:00.783
DOESN'T PAY FOR THEM. THEN THEY

02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:01.985
COULD GO TO A DIFFERENT PROGRAM

02:51:02.051 --> 02:51:03.419
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE FREE TO DO

02:51:03.486 --> 02:51:04.887
THAT AND IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW

02:51:04.954 --> 02:51:06.556
THEIR CHOICE TO GO TO A PROGRAM

02:51:06.623 --> 02:51:07.390
THAT PAID THEM TO GO THROUGH

02:51:07.457 --> 02:51:09.993
SOME OF THE TRAINING- TO LEARN.

02:51:10.059 --> 02:51:12.428
IN SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE

02:51:12.495 --> 02:51:15.565
WAGE ALLIES I KNOW THE BILL- I

02:51:15.632 --> 02:51:16.833
GUESS I SHOULD ASK THE AUTHOR.

02:51:16.899 --> 02:51:18.568
THE BILL DOESN'T MANDATE

02:51:18.635 --> 02:51:22.672
PAYMENT- FOR CLINICALS RIGHT-

02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:24.307
INTERNS OKAY THERE'S NO MANDATE

02:51:24.374 --> 02:51:26.409
FOR PAYMENT AND I THINK THE

02:51:26.476 --> 02:51:29.145
CONCERN IS THAT. IF YOU KNOW

02:51:29.212 --> 02:51:31.414
HOW STATE CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR

02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:33.216
THEIR INTERNS TO HAVE CLINICALS

02:51:33.282 --> 02:51:36.486
N. B. C. PLANT. OR MERCED CAN'T

02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:39.088
BUT ANOTHER COLLEGE CAN I THINK

02:51:39.155 --> 02:51:39.922
THAT'S WHERE THE ROAD IS GOING

02:51:39.989 --> 02:51:41.290
TO BE IN IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT

02:51:41.357 --> 02:51:44.661
SO- IDEA AND- I DO HAVE

02:51:44.727 --> 02:51:46.062
CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL IN THAT

02:51:46.129 --> 02:51:47.730
CASE BUT I JUST THANK YOU FOR

02:51:47.797 --> 02:51:48.865
ANSWERING THE QUESTION IT. IT'S

02:51:48.931 --> 02:51:50.533
NOT MANDATED BUT I THINK IT

02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:53.336
LIES IN THE RECRUITING PIECE-

02:51:53.403 --> 02:51:54.871
FOR CLASSES TO CONTINUE AND IT

02:51:54.937 --> 02:51:56.906
AFFECTS. THE COLLEGE IS

02:51:56.973 --> 02:51:59.175
DIFFERENT IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD

02:51:59.242 --> 02:52:01.210
AND TO PAY FOR THE CLINICALS-

02:52:01.277 --> 02:52:02.578
IN THE INTERNSHIP PROCESS THANK

02:52:02.645 --> 02:52:05.281
