AND THERE'S A VERY RICH

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.620 region:rollup2
AEROSPACE HISTORY HERE.

00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:04.688 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING THAT WE'RE IN NOW

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.756 region:rollup2
WAS AN EXISTING AEROSPACE

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:07.658 region:rollup2
BUILDING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:09.159 region:rollup2
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND THEN

00:52:07.658 --> 00:52:12.196 region:rollup2
CREATE THIS ADVANCED ROCKET.

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:13.697 region:rollup2
FACTORY I'M IN HAWTHORNE. AYE

00:52:12.196 --> 00:52:15.366 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO DEEP SUPPLIER

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:16.600 region:rollup2
NETWORK I BELIEVE AS I REMEMBER

ACOSTA AT REFERENCE THAT IS

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.603 region:rollup2
OPENING REMARKS AND SO WE WERE

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:21.672 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:23.207 region:rollup2
AND REALLY YOU KNOW WORK WITHIN

00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:24.808 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY FOR THAT.

00:52:23.207 --> 00:52:27.044 region:rollup2
IN THERE'S GREAT EDUCATIONAL

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:29.213 region:rollup2
RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS HERE AND

00:52:27.044 --> 00:52:31.615 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO I KNOW BRING A WEALTH

00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:32.483 region:rollup2
OF KNOWLEDGE WITH THEM. AND YOU

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.884 region:rollup2

00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:35.319 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:37.254 region:rollup2
KNOW TECHNICALLY SKILLED WORKERS

00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:38.956 region:rollup2

WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:47.931 region:rollup2
THAT SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:48.732 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS A GREAT PLACE FOR

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:50.968 region:rollup2

NOT RICHARD I GREW UP WATCHING

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:48.425 region:rollup2
THE EARLY EXPLOITS OF THE NASA

00:58:47.424 --> 00:58:49.826 region:rollup2
ASTRONAUTS WATCHING YOU KNOW

00:58:48.425 --> 00:58:51.128 region:rollup2
NEIL AND BUZZ HOP AROUND ON THE

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:52.362 region:rollup2
SURFACE OF THE MOON AND THAT

00:58:51.128 --> 00:58:54.498 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO THAT WHEN HE WHEN HE

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:56.133 region:rollup2
GREW UP. AND THE INDUSTRY HAS

00:58:54.498 --> 00:58:57.634 region:rollup2
NOT INVOLVED IN A WAY SUCH THAT

00:58:56.133 --> 00:58:59.836 region:rollup2
HE'S ABLE TO BUY A TICKET TAKE

00:58:57.634 --> 00:59:00.937 region:rollup2
TO GO TO SPACE HIMSELF SO. HE

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:02.372 region:rollup2
HAD THAT KIND OF CLASSIC

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:03.106 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURS REACTION OF SAYING

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.307 region:rollup2
WELL HERE'S THE THING I WOULD

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:05.442 region:rollup2
REALLY LIKE THAT I WOULD BE

INTO COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS. THIS

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.729 region:rollup2
VEHICLE IT'S ACTUALLY PART OF A

00:59:58.195 --> 01:00:01.731 region:rollup2
VEHICLE SET WHICH IS A FULLY

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:03.934 region:rollup2
REUSABLE SUB ORBITAL HUMAN SPACE

OR SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS OR A

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:11.608 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF THE TWO AT INTO

01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:13.643 region:rollup2
SPACE ON VERY ROUTINE VERY SAFE

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:15.645 region:rollup2
AND VERY AFFORDABLE FLIGHTS.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:17.214 region:rollup2
AND IT IS A AYE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:18.748 region:rollup2
LOOKING VEHICLE CERTAINLY AYE IF

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.549 region:rollup2
YOU'RE USED TO ROCKETS IF YOU'VE

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.151 region:rollup2
BEEN OUT OF VANDENBERG TO WATCH

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:22.252 region:rollup2
FLIGHTS. WHEN YOU CAN SEE THEM

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:23.420 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE FOG AT LEAST TELL

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:24.721 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PROBABLY USED A ROCKET

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.589 region:rollup2
STANDING ON THEIR TAILS AND

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.057 region:rollup2
LAUNCHING FROM LAUNCH PADS ON

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:28.091 region:rollup2
THE GROUND. AT THE VIRGIN GROUP

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:29.593 region:rollup2
OF COMPANIES WE DO THINGS A

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:30.827 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.195 region:rollup2
WE START WITH ROCKETS THAT ARE

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:34.231 region:rollup2
STRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE WINGS OF

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:35.365 region:rollup2
AIRPLANES MUCH LIKE CHUCK YEAGER

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:37.033 region:rollup2
IN THE BELL X. ONE OR THE X.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:38.268 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PROGRAM A LOT OF THE

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:39.836 region:rollup2
GREAT LUMINARIES OF AEROSPACE.

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.704 region:rollup2
AT WHICH OF COURSE FLEW RIGHT

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.439 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:44.441 region:rollup2
NOT SO THE SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:45.242 region:rollup2
THAT VIRGIN OR VIRGIN GALACTIC

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:46.943 region:rollup2
AND.

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:48.612 region:rollup2
AND THE SPACESHIP COMPANY USE.

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:49.713 region:rollup2
INVOLVES A CUSTOM BUILT CARRIER

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:51.448 region:rollup2
AIRCRAFT CALLED THE WHITE

01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:53.049 region:rollup2
KNIGHTS TO WHICH IS A DUAL

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:54.084 region:rollup2
FUSELAGE AIRCRAFT I ALWAYS SORT

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:56.186 region:rollup2
OF JOKINGLY REFER TO IT AS A

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:57.554 region:rollup2
CATAMARAN. AND THEN IN THE

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:58.088 region:rollup2
CENTER THERE THE MORE TRIANGULAR

01:00:57.554 --> 01:01:00.290 region:rollup2
SHAPED.

QUICKLY SUMMARIZE WHAT WE DO IS

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:19.442 region:rollup2
WE ATTACH THE SPACESHIP TO THE

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:21.111 region:rollup2
WING OF THE CARRIER AIRCRAFT IT

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:21.645 region:rollup2
TAKES OFF. LIKE A NORMAL

THE WING OF THE AIRPLANE IT FREE

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:38.762 region:rollup2
FALLS AWAY FROM THE AIRPLANE FOR

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:40.297 region:rollup2
A FEW SECONDS TO GET GOOD

01:01:38.762 --> 01:01:41.464 region:rollup2
SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:43.266 region:rollup2

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:16.466 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES OR WORK FOR PRIVATE

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.567 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LIKE SOME OF THE ONES

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:19.536 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER TODAY.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:22.606 region:rollup2
IT IS UP PRIMARILY THOUGHT OF

01:02:19.536 --> 01:02:23.673 region:rollup2
AS A SPUR SPACE TOURISM PROGRAM.

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:25.008 region:rollup2
AND SPACE TOURISM IS A REALLY

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:26.509 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT VIRGIN

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:27.877 region:rollup2
GALACTIC DIES SPACE TOURIST ALSO

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.979 region:rollup2
HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THEY

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:30.080 region:rollup2
CONTROL THEIR OWN BUDGET AND

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:31.648 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BUY A TICKET ON THE

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.116 region:rollup2
VEHICLE THAT'S NOT YET BUILT IF

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:34.217 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EXCITED ENOUGH ABOUT IT.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.285 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.386 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:37.220 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MY EDUCATIONAL

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:39.689 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND IS IN THE SPACE

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.991 region:rollup2
SCIENCES. IS THE ABILITY TO USE

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:43.093 region:rollup2
THE SAME VEHICLE WITH THE SAME

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:44.561 region:rollup2
PILOTS FLYING THE SAME FIGHT

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.895 region:rollup2
TRAJECTORY AS A RESEARCH VESSEL.

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:46.963 region:rollup2
ASA VIRGIN GALACTIC IN THE

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:48.298 region:rollup2
SPACESHIP COMPANY OVER THE

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:49.666 region:rollup2
COURSE OF ABOUT AN HOUR CAN

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:51.334 region:rollup2
RECONFIGURE THE CABIN OF THE

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:51.868 region:rollup2
VEHICLE BASICALLY PULLING OUT

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.670 region:rollup2
SOME SEATS PUTTING IN SOME

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:55.305 region:rollup2
RACKS.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.406 region:rollup2
AND HAVING A SYSTEM WHEREBY

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:57.507 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTS AGAIN THAT COULD BE

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:59.142 region:rollup2
BUILT BY STUDENTS ARE COULD BE

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.176 region:rollup2
BUILT BY NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS ARE

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.911 region:rollup2
ANYONE IN BETWEEN.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:04.047 region:rollup2
CAN'T CAN FLY THEIR EXPERIMENTS

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:05.081 region:rollup2
TO SPACE I TYPICALLY THEY BE

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:06.516 region:rollup2
FINE THINGS EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:08.151 region:rollup2
EACH ABOUT THE SIZE SOMEWHERE

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:10.053 region:rollup2
BETWEEN MAYBE A MICROWAVE OVEN

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:11.121 region:rollup2
OR A DORM ROOM REFRIGERATOR. AND

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:12.322 region:rollup2
THEY CAN SOMETIMES YOU CAN STACK

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.790 region:rollup2
A FEW THOSE TOGETHER IF YOU NEED

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:15.358 region:rollup2
A BIGGER EXPERIMENT BUT IT'S

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.926 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY ROUGHLY IN THAT CLASS.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:18.762 region:rollup2
I'M THESE VEHICLES ARE BILLS

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:19.596 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALITY AND THEIR NOT

01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:21.197 region:rollup2
YET IN COMMERCIAL SERVICE

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:23.400 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:25.068 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO. TEST AND TEST AND

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.669 region:rollup2
KEEP TESTING THESE AYE WE DO

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:27.671 region:rollup2
WANT TO FLY.

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:28.938 region:rollup2
CIVILIANS ON THESE VEHICLES

01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:30.373 region:rollup2
INCLUDING OUR BOSS RICHARD

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:32.008 region:rollup2
BRANSON WANTS TO BE CUSTOMER

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:33.243 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE HOW WOULD YOU CAN

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.477 region:rollup2
IMAGINE PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THE

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:35.779 region:rollup2
ON THE ENGINEERS THE OPERATING

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.614 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE TO ENSURE NOT ONLY

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:38.415 region:rollup2
THAT HE'S GONNA COME HOME SAFELY

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:39.983 region:rollup2
BUT THAT HE'S GONNA COME HOME

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:40.583 region:rollup2
SMILING.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.518 region:rollup2
AND EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.819 region:rollup2
ALL DOING.

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:44.554 region:rollup2
SO AS I MENTIONED THE VEHICLE

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:46.456 region:rollup2
SYSTEM INVOLVES TWO VEHICLES

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.090 region:rollup2
THAT CATAMARAN LIKE CARRIER

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:47.957 region:rollup2
AIRCRAFT WHICH WE CALL THE WHITE

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.426 region:rollup2
KNIGHT TO.

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:50.994 region:rollup2
AS OF TODAY THAT HAS FLOWN

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:52.762 region:rollup2
SAFELY TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.897 region:rollup2
TIMES IT HAS CREWMEMBERS ONBOARD

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:55.598 region:rollup2
IN EVERY SINGLE FLIGHT THERE ARE

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:56.766 region:rollup2
NO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES HERE

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.901 region:rollup2
THERE'S THESE ARE NOT DRONES

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.469 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ALL. HUMAN PILOTED

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.270 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:01.171 region:rollup2
I SO THAT'S FOR THE CARRIER

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.006 region:rollup2
AIRCRAFT.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:04.274 region:rollup2
THE SPACESHIP ITSELF HAS THAT

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.508 region:rollup2
HAS RECENTLY COMPLETED IT'S

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:07.077 region:rollup2
TWELFTH FIGHT INCLUDING ITS

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.178 region:rollup2
FIRST SUPERSONIC ROCKET POWERED

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.312 region:rollup2
FLIGHT WHICH IS A REALLY MAJOR

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:11.247 region:rollup2
MILESTONE.

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:12.649 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROGRAM AYE IT DID GO.

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:13.750 region:rollup2
ABOUT MACH ONE POINT EIGHT IF

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:15.051 region:rollup2
I'M RECALLING CORRECTLY ON THAT

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.352 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FLIGHT.

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:18.421 region:rollup2
WE HOPE TO EVENTUALLY BURN THE

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:19.789 region:rollup2
ENGINE FOR FAR LONGER AS WE GET

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.356 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE DOING SO.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.224 region:rollup2
IT ALL.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:22.826 region:rollup2
IT'LL EVENTUALLY TAKE THE

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:24.761 region:rollup2
VEHICLE AS A SET UP TO MACH

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:25.595 region:rollup2
THREE POINT FIVE OR SO AND SO

01:04:24.761 --> 01:04:27.764 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM TO

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:28.798 region:rollup2
GO BY THATBUT OBVIOUSLY AS. AS

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:30.266 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS KNOW BETTER THAN

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:31.501 region:rollup2
ANYONE THAT THAT BARRIER WHEN

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:32.135 region:rollup2
YOU CROSS THROUGH THE AT WITH

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.269 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS THROUGH THE SOUND

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:35.372 region:rollup2
BARRIER IS AT SOME OF THE

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:35.939 region:rollup2
TRICKIEST THINGS IN AND WE HAVE

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.573 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DO

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:37.941 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:39.776 region:rollup2
I OUT WE ARE JUST BUILDING A

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:41.277 region:rollup2
SPACE SHIP WERE BUILDING A SPACE

01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:42.512 region:rollup2
LINE IN A SPACE SHIP FACTORY.

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:44.180 region:rollup2
AND SO HERE IS A RELATIVELY

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:45.148 region:rollup2
RECENT CLAIMS FROM THE FROM THE

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.916 region:rollup2
AYE SHOP FOR.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:48.451 region:rollup2
THANKS TO THAT THE INVESTMENT

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:49.753 region:rollup2
WE RECEIVED IN PARTICULAR THANKS

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.421 region:rollup2
TO THE TALENT OF OUR WORKFORCE

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:53.590 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN A BEGUN ASSEMBLY ON

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:54.324 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TO SPACESHIPS. I

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.558 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT.

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:57.193 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY IN AND I

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:58.161 region:rollup2
THINK ASSEMBLYMAN ACOSTA YOU HAD

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:59.028 region:rollup2
A CHANCE TO COME UP AND VISIT US

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:00.397 region:rollup2
WEEKLY FOR WHICH WERE VERY

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:01.965 region:rollup2
GRATEFUL AND YOU GOT A CHANCE TO

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:03.266 region:rollup2
SEE THE NEXT TWO SPACESHIPS

01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:05.068 region:rollup2
WHICH WE LOVE MICHAEL AT A AND

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:06.903 region:rollup2
R. D. AFTER OUT TO RICHARD'S

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:08.071 region:rollup2
GRANDCHILDREN. NOW WHICH ARE IN

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.139 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF BEING ASSEMBLING

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:11.174 region:rollup2
AND HOPE WE'RE HOPING TO ENTER

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.574 region:rollup2
INTO THE INTO THE FLEET QUITE

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:13.109 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:14.444 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S VIRGIN GALACTIC IN THE

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:15.745 region:rollup2
SPACE COME STATE SPACESHIP

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:17.213 region:rollup2
COMPANY AND THE HUMAN SPACE

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.648 region:rollup2
FLIGHT SIDE OF WHAT THE VIRGIN

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.916 region:rollup2
GROUP IS DOING IN SPACE. NOW IN

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:21.451 region:rollup2
A TRANSITION AND QUICKLY TALK

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.552 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:23.920 region:rollup2
BUSINESS WHICH IS VIRGIN ORBIT.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:25.054 region:rollup2
WAS MY CURRENT AT MY CURRENT

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.289 region:rollup2
POSITION HERE.

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:28.057 region:rollup2
AT THIS IS.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:29.359 region:rollup2
AGAIN DOING SOMETHING

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:30.393 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHICALLY VERY SIMILAR

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:32.095 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MAKING SPACE FLIGHTS

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:33.430 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE FREQUENT AND MUCH MORE

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:35.231 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE WITHOUT SACRIFICING

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:36.866 region:rollup2
ANY RELIABILITY. BUT INSTEAD OF

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:37.367 region:rollup2
DOING THAT FOR ASTRONAUTS WERE

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.401 region:rollup2
DOING THIS FOR FOR SMALL

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.736 region:rollup2
SATELLITES.

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:40.770 region:rollup2
NOT LIKE VIRGIN GALACTIC INTO

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:42.739 region:rollup2
YOU SEE WE ALSO USE AN AIR

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.007 region:rollup2
LAUNCH SYSTEM SO AGAIN INSTEAD

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:45.675 region:rollup2
OF A ROCKET STANDING ON ITS TAIL

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:46.943 region:rollup2
AT VANDENBERG AIRFORCE BASE OR.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:48.511 region:rollup2
CAPE CANAVERAL ANYONE ANYWHERE

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.913 region:rollup2
ELSE WE START WITH A ROCKET THAT

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:51.181 region:rollup2
STRAPPED UNDER THE WING OF A

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:52.515 region:rollup2
CARRIER AIRCRAFT.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:53.716 region:rollup2
AND IN THIS CASE RATHER THAN

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:55.985 region:rollup2
USING A CUSTOM BUILT CARRIER

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:57.720 region:rollup2
AIRCRAFT WE USE THE WORLD'S MOST

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:59.222 region:rollup2
RELIABLE HIGH THE PROVEN INITIAL

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.090 region:rollup2
STAVING SAGE OF A ROCKET.

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:03.059 region:rollup2
WE USE THAT OF A BOEING SEVEN

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:04.194 region:rollup2
FOUR SEVEN ON IT IS NOWHERE NEAR

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:05.795 region:rollup2
AS IMPRESSIVE ARE CAPABLE IN

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.996 region:rollup2
MANY WAYS AS A FALCON NINE FOR

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.398 region:rollup2
STAGE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.732 region:rollup2
WEEK THEY THEY GET A STANDING

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:10.366 region:rollup2
OVATION EVERY TIME THEY BRING

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:12.068 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE HOMES WHICH REALLY

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:13.136 region:rollup2
IS REMARKABLE. ABBOTT SIMPLY

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:14.437 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:16.039 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN FINE FOR THIRTY OR

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:17.240 region:rollup2
FORTY YEARS OF THEM FANTASTIC

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:18.675 region:rollup2
SAFETY RECORD AND YOU CAN TURN

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.276 region:rollup2
AROUND ABOUT FORTY FIVE TIMES.

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:21.377 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT GET US ANYWHERE NEAR

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:22.479 region:rollup2
AS CLOSE TO SPACE OBVIOUSLY IS

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:23.646 region:rollup2
THE FIRST STAGE BUT IT DOES GIVE

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.448 region:rollup2
US A LITTLE BIT OF A HEAD START

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.149 region:rollup2
ON ON THE WAY TO SPACE AND. GIVE

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:29.419 region:rollup2
US A LOT OF.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:30.753 region:rollup2
OF RESPONSIVENESS A LOT OF THAT

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:32.622 region:rollup2
LIKE WE CALL UP TIME THE ABILITY

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:34.090 region:rollup2
TO EXACT ACCESS DIFFERENT ORBITS

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:35.391 region:rollup2
WHICH IS PARTICULAR. BUT WHICH

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.593 region:rollup2
IS ADAM PARTICULARLY USEFUL

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:38.027 region:rollup2
OFTEN MAYBE TO OUR GOVERNMENT

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.595 region:rollup2
CLIENTS BUT ALSO INCREASINGLY TO

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:40.663 region:rollup2
OUR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AS

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:41.598 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:44.133 region:rollup2
WE'VE PAIRED THAT.

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:46.402 region:rollup2
VERY PROVEN AT AIRCRAFT WITH AS

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:47.504 region:rollup2
SIMPLE A ROCKET AS WE CAN MAKE.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.838 region:rollup2
AND IT IS NOT THE HIGHEST

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.373 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE ROCKET IF YOU LOOK

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:52.308 region:rollup2
AT OUR THRUST NUMBERS NEXT TO.

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:53.309 region:rollup2
NEXT TO A FALCON NINE OR SOME

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.777 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ROCKETS ON THE MARKET

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.212 region:rollup2
WE LOOK MINUSCULE IMPUNITY BY

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:57.747 region:rollup2
COMPARISON AND WE DO THAT ON

01:06:56.212 --> 01:06:58.348 region:rollup2
PURPOSE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.382 region:rollup2
PRICES LOW AS WE CAN POSSIBLY

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.017 region:rollup2
MAKE.

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:02.485 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO TAKE

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.786 region:rollup2
HUMANS BEING BEINGS TO MARS AS

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:05.355 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL AS THAT IS.

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:06.656 region:rollup2
MY WIFE WORKS FOR THE JET

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:08.424 region:rollup2
PROPULSION LABORATORY ON MARS

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:09.292 region:rollup2
MISSION SO I SO I'M I'M ALL IN

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.326 region:rollup2
FAVOR OF MORE THOSE KINDS OF

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:11.995 region:rollup2
MISSIONS WERE JUST SIMPLY

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:13.096 region:rollup2
ANSWERING A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:14.497 region:rollup2
I WHICH IS HOW HOW HOW DO WE

01:07:13.096 --> 01:07:15.765 region:rollup2
MAKE THE A TICKET PRICES LOWEST

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:17.367 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE WE DO THAT THEIR

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.834 region:rollup2
SIMPLICITY. AND WE DO THAT

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.369 region:rollup2
THROUGH SOME ADVANCED

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:21.204 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.438 region:rollup2
I STARTING JUNE ENGAGED NOT ONLY

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:23.406 region:rollup2
THREE PRINTING BUT REALLY THE

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:23.973 region:rollup2
NEXT GENERATION OF SOME OF THE

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.542 region:rollup2
pMANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES SO

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.809 region:rollup2
THAT

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.878 region:rollup2
WE CAN BUILD THESE. IN

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:30.380 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBERS I'M TO

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.915 region:rollup2
PUT THIS IN INSISTS THAT IN A

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.783 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT LAST YEAR

01:07:31.915 --> 01:07:35.318 region:rollup2
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD THERE WERE

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:36.319 region:rollup2
NINETY LAUNCHES TO SPACE. THAT'S

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.820 region:rollup2
EVERY ROCKET OF EVERY

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:39.722 region:rollup2
CONFIGURATION WITH OTHER HUMANS

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.456 region:rollup2
ON TOP OR SATELLITES WITH ITS

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.791 region:rollup2
MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL OR

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:43.326 region:rollup2
CIVILIAN. WE WOULD LIKE TO DO

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:45.061 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR FLIGHTS PER YEAR IN

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:47.063 region:rollup2
THE VERY NEAR TERM I'M OUT OF

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:48.531 region:rollup2
OUR OUT OF OUR LUNCH FACILITIES

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.999 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:52.268 region:rollup2
AND I NEVER FACTORED PARTICULAR

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:53.369 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO SO WE'D

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:54.938 region:rollup2
LIKE TO BE BUILDING AT.

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.905 region:rollup2
I USE HIGH RATE IN IN AIR QUOTES

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:57.340 region:rollup2
A VERY HIGH RATE FOR THE ROCKET

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.608 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY EVEN IF IT'S LOW RATE

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.175 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO AT SOME OF THE

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:00.310 region:rollup2
THINGS MANUFACTURED HERE IN

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.477 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.812 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A QUICK

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:04.514 region:rollup2
UPDATE ON THE PROGRAM.

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:06.182 region:rollup2
WE PURCHASED THE AIRPLANE.

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:07.150 region:rollup2
IT WAS NICELY AN AIRPLANE THAT

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:08.718 region:rollup2
WAS BEING FLOWN BY ONE OF OUR

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:10.053 region:rollup2
SISTER COMPANIES VIRGIN ATLANTIC

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:11.120 region:rollup2
AND LIKE MOST AIRLINES THEY

01:08:10.053 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
DON'T OWN THEIR AIRPLANES THERE

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.189 region:rollup2
RELEASE THEM THEIR LEASE WAS

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.057 region:rollup2
COMING UP AND WE WERE ABLE TO

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.491 region:rollup2
AT.

01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:17.060 region:rollup2
TO COME IN AND BUY THE AIRPLANE.

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:18.628 region:rollup2
IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT IT WAS

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.963 region:rollup2
FLYING UNDER THE NAME COSMIC

01:08:18.628 --> 01:08:20.964 region:rollup2
GIRL WHICH MADE IT SEEM A LITTLE

01:08:19.963 --> 01:08:22.599 region:rollup2
BIT LIKE FATE THAT WE'RE USING

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:24.033 region:rollup2
IT AS A. AS A LAUNCH PLATFORM

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.635 region:rollup2
FOR OUT FOR SATELLITES OF A

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.736 region:rollup2
GARDEN AND LOOK BACK ON OUR HOME

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:28.504 region:rollup2
WORLD AS WELL AS EXPLORE THE

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:30.006 region:rollup2
COSMOS THERE. SO THE AIRCRAFT IS

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:31.541 region:rollup2
UP IN FLIGHT TEST NOW WE WE DID

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:32.742 region:rollup2
A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE MODIFICATION

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:34.477 region:rollup2
TO THE AIRCRAFT AS YOU CAN

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:35.478 region:rollup2
IMAGINE NOT ONLY DOING THINGS

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:37.180 region:rollup2
LIKE PULLING OUT ALL THE SEATS

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:38.815 region:rollup2
IN. THE LABORATORIES IN THE

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.249 region:rollup2
GALLEYS IN THE OVERHEAD BINS BUT

01:08:38.815 --> 01:08:41.684 region:rollup2
ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:43.286 region:rollup2
WIRED THE AIRPLANE TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:45.254 region:rollup2
TALK TO AND CARRIED THE ROCKETS

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:46.422 region:rollup2
SAFELY. I'M SEVEN FOUR SEVENS IT

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:48.091 region:rollup2
TURNS OUT ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:49.392 region:rollup2
BUILT TO CARRY A PAYLOAD UNDER

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:50.793 region:rollup2
THEIR WINGS ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:52.428 region:rollup2
DO IT TERRIBLY OFTEN WE'RE

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:54.030 region:rollup2
LEVERAGING A PRE EXISTING BIT OF

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:54.664 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING CALLED THE FIFTH

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:55.832 region:rollup2
ENGINE CARRY POSITION.

01:08:54.664 --> 01:08:57.333 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.768 region:rollup2
POSITION OF THE CEO OF AN

01:08:57.333 --> 01:09:00.103 region:rollup2
AIRLINE IF YOU EVER NEED TO

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.704 region:rollup2
ORDER AN EXTRA JET ENGINE SO YOU

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:03.339 region:rollup2
HAVE INVENTORY ON HAND. THE WAY

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:03.940 region:rollup2
THAT'S DELIVERED TO YOU IS

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:05.475 region:rollup2
CARRIED UNDER THE WING OF THE

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.609 region:rollup2
SEVEN FOUR SEVEN. AM WHAT WE'RE

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.377 region:rollup2
CARRYING IS NOT AN AIRCRAFT

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.478 region:rollup2
ENGINE IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:08.678 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SIZE LIVE A DIFFERENT

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.446 region:rollup2
MASS.

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:12.081 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS AWFULLY NICE TO BE

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:13.316 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GO TO ENGINEERING THAT

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:14.784 region:rollup2
BOEING DID THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.952 region:rollup2
AGO THAT HAS A PERFECT SAFETY

01:09:14.784 --> 01:09:17.153 region:rollup2
RECORD AND SAY OKAY LET'S USE

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:19.088 region:rollup2
THAT AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:20.556 region:rollup2
BUILD UPON THAT.

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:21.658 region:rollup2
I'M WE HAVE BUILT BY SEVERAL

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:23.493 region:rollup2
ROCKETS AND ALSO YOU SOME MORE

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.394 region:rollup2
PICTURES OF THOSE LATER BY THIS

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.295 region:rollup2
IS THAT A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:27.864 region:rollup2
FIRST FULLY ASSEMBLED ROCKET TO

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:29.799 region:rollup2
LEAVE OUR FACTORY DOORS AT LATE

01:09:27.864 --> 01:09:31.134 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR. WHICH WENT UP TO OUT

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:32.368 region:rollup2
TO THE MOJAVE AIR AND SPACE PORT

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:33.836 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CONDUCTED A FULL SET OF

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.270 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL LAUNCH CAMPAIGN

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.304 region:rollup2
REHEARSALS THESE ARE

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.706 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY.

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:38.174 region:rollup2
WET DRESS REHEARSALS WHERE WE

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:39.676 region:rollup2
PRACTICE MATING THE.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.410 region:rollup2
THE ROCKET TO SOMETHING THAT

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:42.378 region:rollup2
STIMULATES THE WING OF THE

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:43.780 region:rollup2
AIRPLANE WE PRACTICE FUELING IT

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:44.647 region:rollup2
WOULD PASS IT BY TRIES AND WE

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.715 region:rollup2
GET ALL OF OUR.

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:47.450 region:rollup2
ALL OF OUR HARD WORKING

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:48.985 region:rollup2
TECHNICIANS IN AN OPERATOR'S AT

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:50.420 region:rollup2
THEIR AT THEIR VARIOUS POSITIONS

01:09:48.985 --> 01:09:51.320 region:rollup2
IN MISSION CONTROL AND DO

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.855 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING UP INTO THE MOMENT

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.823 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WOULD PRESS GO.

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:54.724 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL AND I JUST TO MAKE

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:56.492 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE'VE THAT WERE ABLE

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:59.328 region:rollup2
TO RUN THOSE PROCESSES UP VERY

01:09:56.492 --> 01:10:00.096 region:rollup2
GRATEFUL TO TO REPORT THAT THOSE

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.764 region:rollup2
WENT OFF EXTRAORDINARILY WELL.

01:10:00.096 --> 01:10:03.099 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FINISHED DEVELOPING ARE

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:04.634 region:rollup2
NOW IN THE LATER PHASES OF

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:06.135 region:rollup2
QUALIFYING ALL OF THE MAJOR

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:07.470 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES OF THE ROCKET. FOR

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.738 region:rollup2
THE MOST PART STRUCTURES TESTING

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.872 region:rollup2
IS LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:11.240 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TANK

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.141 region:rollup2
AND HOPING IT DOESN'T BREAK AT

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.242 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:15.645 region:rollup2
INTERESTING IMAGES THAT I COULD

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:17.146 region:rollup2
FIND OF A VAT OF AYE AYE NOSE

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:19.048 region:rollup2
CONE OR A PAYLOAD FAIRING OPEN.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:20.483 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE REALLY PUTTING

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:22.051 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THROUGH ITS PACES

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:22.919 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE AN ENTIRE

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.654 region:rollup2
SECTION OF OUR FACTORY THAT I'D

01:10:22.919 --> 01:10:26.022 region:rollup2
LIKE TO. LOVINGLY REFER TO AS

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:27.323 region:rollup2
THE MEDIEVAL TORTURE CHAMBER

01:10:26.022 --> 01:10:28.157 region:rollup2
WHERE WE TAKE ALL THE PARTS THAT

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.659 region:rollup2
WE BUILT AND WE TRY AND BREAK

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:30.560 region:rollup2
THEM UP ON THE THEORY THAT IF

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.527 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EVER GONNA BREAK WE'D

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.162 region:rollup2
LIKE TO BREAK THEM ON PURPOSE IN

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:34.797 region:rollup2
THE FACTORY BEFORE THEY BREAK BY

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:36.699 region:rollup2
ACCIDENT SOMEWHERE ELSE. AYE SO

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:37.667 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:39.268 region:rollup2
WERE IN THE THICK OF RIGHT NOW.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:40.670 region:rollup2
I'M WE'VE DESIGNED ALL OF OUR

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:42.138 region:rollup2
OWN ROCKET ENGINES.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:44.207 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN BUYING THEM FROM AN

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:45.141 region:rollup2
OVERSEAS SUPPLIER AND I'M WE

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:45.742 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT WE HAVE BUILT THOSE IN

01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:47.677 region:rollup2
HOUSE.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:49.212 region:rollup2
AND ARE HAVE BEEN TESTING THEM

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:49.912 region:rollup2
FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY ARE

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:51.948 region:rollup2
DESIGNED AND BUILT.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:53.749 region:rollup2
AND AND I IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:55.084 region:rollup2
TESTED UP IN KERN COUNTY I'M WE

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:56.352 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TESTING THEM FOR A

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.187 region:rollup2
LONG TIME AT FULL DURATION AND

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:59.989 region:rollup2
AT FULL THRUST.

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:01.324 region:rollup2
THE TESTING IS NOT DONE AND IN

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.492 region:rollup2
FACT WILL NEVER BE DONE YOU KNOW

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:03.593 region:rollup2
AUTOMOBILE ENGINE STILL GET

01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:04.560 region:rollup2
BETTER EVERY YEAR AND THOSE HAVE

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.262 region:rollup2
BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE SO YOU

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.230 region:rollup2
NEVER QUITE PUT THE PEN DOWN. WE

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.798 region:rollup2
ARE TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:09.799 region:rollup2
DONE ALL THE RISKIEST THINGS NOW

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.434 region:rollup2
WHICH I NEED TO DO OTHER ISSUES

01:11:09.799 --> 01:11:13.236 region:rollup2
THINGS EVERY TIME AND THAT

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:13.836 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY DID THAT THE HEART

AND THAT HAS CONTINUED TO RING

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.693 region:rollup2
TRUE OUT WHEN WE NEED SOMETHING

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:25.828 region:rollup2

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:49.324 region:rollup2
DOWN TO.

01:28:47.289 --> 01:28:52.360 region:rollup2
DOING THAT MOVING DOWN TO

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:54.796 region:rollup2
FLORIDA FOR THAT CONSOLATION.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.398 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:58.066 region:rollup2
BEEN IMPORTANT IN THIS GROWING

01:28:56.398 --> 01:28:59.568 region:rollup2

TWIGS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY.

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:21.082 region:rollup2
THIS TECHNOLOGY PRETTY MUCH

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.449 region:rollup2
BEEN AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.318 region:rollup2
YEARS PRIOR TO.

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:25.520 region:rollup2
.

01:30:23.318 --> 01:30:26.955 region:rollup2
SPACE AS PRIOR TO PLANETS

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.357 region:rollup2
ADOPTION BUT.

01:30:26.955 --> 01:30:31.326 region:rollup2
BOTH WILL AND CHRIS WORKING AT

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:33.061 region:rollup2
NASA AMES WERE VERY FAMILIAR

01:30:31.326 --> 01:30:35.030 region:rollup2
WITH P. WHARTON'S VISION OF

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:36.965 region:rollup2
SMALL SATELLITES AS THEY APPLY

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:38.466 region:rollup2
TO THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY.

01:30:36.965 --> 01:30:41.269 region:rollup2
SO CHRIS AND WILL.

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:43.438 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS SPUN OUT OF NASA

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:45.840 region:rollup2
AMES TO FORM PLANET AND.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:47.809 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.711 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY AND CONSTERNATION

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:52.147 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE UTILITY OF SMALL

01:30:49.711 --> 01:30:53.748 region:rollup2
SATELLITES ON HIM LOW WORTH

01:30:52.147 --> 01:30:55.383 region:rollup2
ORBIT. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE IN

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:58.453 region:rollup2
LOW EARTH ORBIT MEANS THAT YOU

01:30:55.383 --> 01:31:00.121 region:rollup2
HAVE A BENIGN RADIATION AND.

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:02.924 region:rollup2
AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO USE WHAT

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:03.958 region:rollup2
ARE TERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:05.794 region:rollup2
UMMAH IN THAT.

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:07.595 region:rollup2
ON IN IT AT THAT AT THOSE

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:08.096 region:rollup2
ALTITUDES.

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:10.165 region:rollup2
SO.

01:31:08.096 --> 01:31:12.467 region:rollup2
MAHOOD PLANET.

01:31:10.165 --> 01:31:14.669 region:rollup2
INITIALLY FLEW A A FEW

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:16.404 region:rollup2
SATELLITES AND TODAY HAS GROWN

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:18.406 region:rollup2
TO OVER TWO HUNDRED SATELLITES

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:21.676 region:rollup2
IN LOW EARTH ORBIT THAT PROVIDE

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:24.112 region:rollup2
A TWICE DAILY SNAPSHOT. OF OF

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:25.880 region:rollup2
THE PLANET AS AN ASTRONOMER I

01:31:24.112 --> 01:31:27.849 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT EVERY TIME YOU BUILD A

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:29.250 region:rollup2
NEW OBSERVATIONAL FACILITY

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:30.752 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO DERIVE NEW

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:32.454 region:rollup2
RESULTS. AND.

01:31:30.752 --> 01:31:33.421 region:rollup2
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

01:31:32.454 --> 01:31:35.523 region:rollup2
WHATEVER WE HAPPEN TO BE

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:38.393 region:rollup2
OBSERVING IN THIS CASE OF ITS

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:38.927 region:rollup2
THE EARTH. OF PLANET ALLIES ALSO

01:31:38.393 --> 01:31:41.129 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE TO GROWING SUPPLY

01:31:38.927 --> 01:31:43.031 region:rollup2
CHAIN.

01:31:41.129 --> 01:31:45.967 region:rollup2
AND WITH SECONDARY LAUNCH

01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:48.136 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES ON VEHICLES LIKE

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:49.871 region:rollup2
SPACEX AND OTHERS THREE ABLE TO

01:31:48.136 --> 01:31:52.040 region:rollup2
DEPLOY THE SATELLITES IN LOW

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:53.441 region:rollup2
EARTH ORBIT I SHOW HERE THE

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.410 region:rollup2
SATELLITES BEING DEPLOYED FROM

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:56.945 region:rollup2
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:59.014 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS A RELATIVELY NOVEL.

01:31:56.945 --> 01:32:01.316 region:rollup2
CONCEPT AND PIONEERED BY THE

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:02.984 region:rollup2
SMALL SATELLITE COMMUNITY HERE

01:32:01.316 --> 01:32:04.953 region:rollup2
AND IT'S HIGHER PAYLOAD OF SMALL

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:06.788 region:rollup2
SATELLITES OR SHIPPED UP TO THE

01:32:04.953 --> 01:32:09.224 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND

01:32:06.788 --> 01:32:11.793 region:rollup2
THEN DEPLOYED BY ASTRONAUTS ON A

01:32:09.224 --> 01:32:14.562 region:rollup2
BOOM SHOWN HERE A COMPANY CALLED

01:32:11.793 --> 01:32:16.464 region:rollup2
NARAL RACKS ACTUALLY OF. SERVES

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:17.799 region:rollup2
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.768 region:rollup2
AND THE SMALL SATELLITE

01:32:17.799 --> 01:32:21.970 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF

01:32:19.768 --> 01:32:23.705 region:rollup2
SATELLITES IN LOWER THOR AND

01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:25.306 region:rollup2
LOWER EARTH ORBIT.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:26.341 region:rollup2
THE SATELLITES AS YOU CAN SEE BY

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:28.410 region:rollup2
WITH STEVE ARE ABOUT THE SIZE OF

01:32:26.341 --> 01:32:29.010 region:rollup2
A BREAD BOX.

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:30.512 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:32.313 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGIES ABLE

01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:33.848 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED AT A PRICE POINT WHICH

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:35.417 region:rollup2
IS AMENABLE TO VENTURE CAPITAL

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:36.484 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:32:35.417 --> 01:32:37.852 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH NEW

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.687 region:rollup2
SPACE.

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:41.689 region:rollup2
IS NOT THAT VENTURE CAPITALISTS

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:44.192 region:rollup2
HAVE EMBRACED SPACE IT'S THAT

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:46.161 region:rollup2
SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS MOVED

01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:48.129 region:rollup2
INTO THE FUNDING ENVELOPE WHICH

01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:50.465 region:rollup2
IS TYPICAL OF A SILICON VALLEY

DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE HARDWARE

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:12.200 region:rollup2
BETTER USING THE DATA THAT COMES

01:36:10.632 --> 01:36:13.835 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER SATELLITE COMPANIES

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.369 region:rollup2
AND MAKING THAT LAST MARK THAT

01:36:13.835 --> 01:36:16.804 region:rollup2
LAST MILE PLAY.

01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:18.172 region:rollup2
.

ORBIT FIBER IN IT MANUFACTURING.

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:30.051 region:rollup2
I THINK MADE IN SPACE IS A

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:31.185 region:rollup2
UNIQUE COMPANY BECAUSE IT'S

01:36:30.051 --> 01:36:33.254 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PIONEERED ITS

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:36.424 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY USING SUBORBITAL

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:37.925 region:rollup2
FLIGHTS OF BEFORE DEPLOYING TO

THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:39.861 region:rollup2
THE FIBER THAT THE PLANNING ON

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:42.397 region:rollup2
MAKING.

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:44.165 region:rollup2
HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING HIGH

01:36:42.397 --> 01:36:46.734 region:rollup2
THROUGHPUT. AND.

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:48.736 region:rollup2
LOW ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS TO

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:51.339 region:rollup2
ENABLE BROAD SPECTRUM AND THEN

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:52.874 region:rollup2
HIGH DATA RATES UNLIKE A WHAT

01:36:51.339 --> 01:36:54.842 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY.

01:36:52.874 --> 01:36:56.878 region:rollup2
A WHEN I LOOK AT VEHICLES LIKE

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:58.813 region:rollup2
VIRGIN GALACTIC AND THEIR USE IS

01:36:56.878 --> 01:37:01.816 region:rollup2
A RESEARCH PLATFORM NOT ONLY IS

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:04.285 region:rollup2
IT. JUST FOR A TOURISTS AND

01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:05.853 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS BUT FOR PDB PLAY

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:07.355 region:rollup2
MAIDEN SPACE DID ABOUT FOUR

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:09.324 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PARABOLAS ON THE ZERO G.

01:37:07.355 --> 01:37:11.159 region:rollup2
VEHICLE TO PROVE OUT FOR THREE

01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:12.660 region:rollup2
D. PRINTING TECHNOLOGY. THIS WAS

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:13.795 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT USE OF THAT VEHICLE

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:18.399 region:rollup2
BEFORE GOING TO THE

01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:19.701 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:21.836 region:rollup2
WITH THIS WE EXPECT TO SEE A

01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:24.572 region:rollup2
WIDE VARIETY. OF.

01:37:21.836 --> 01:37:26.274 region:rollup2
SMALL SATELLITE GUN COMPANIES

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:27.642 region:rollup2
AS I'VE SHOWN IN THE LAST SLIDE

01:37:26.274 --> 01:37:30.044 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY OVER THE NEXT FIVE

01:37:27.642 --> 01:37:31.913 region:rollup2
YEARS IS PROJECTED DOUBLE SEE

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:33.181 region:rollup2
ABOUT A THREE X. INCREASE. IN

01:37:31.913 --> 01:37:34.449 region:rollup2
SMALL SATELLITES IN LOW EARTH

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:36.150 region:rollup2
ORBIT.

01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:37.952 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NUMBER OF INCUBATORS

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:40.154 region:rollup2
AND ACCELERATORS FOR INSTANCE

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:41.923 region:rollup2
THE FOUNDERS INSTITUTE. OF HAS

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:43.891 region:rollup2
THEIR STAR FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

01:37:41.923 --> 01:37:45.493 region:rollup2
THAT EXPECTS TO GRADUATE OVER

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:47.128 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED.

01:37:45.493 --> 01:37:48.096 region:rollup2
NEW SPACE START UPS.

01:37:47.128 --> 01:37:50.932 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT.

01:37:48.096 --> 01:37:52.767 region:rollup2
SEVEN YEARS THIS IS IDEA RESI

01:37:50.932 --> 01:37:54.736 region:rollup2
THE FOUNDER OF FOUNDER THE

01:37:52.767 --> 01:37:56.037 region:rollup2
FOUNDER OF FOUNDERS INSTITUTE OF

01:37:54.736 --> 01:37:57.772 region:rollup2
SPEAKING WITH STEVE JURVETSON

01:37:56.037 --> 01:37:59.507 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE EARLY INVESTORS. IN

01:37:57.772 --> 01:38:00.708 region:rollup2
PLANET LABS.

01:37:59.507 --> 01:38:03.444 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE COMPANIES THAT I'VE

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:05.413 region:rollup2
LISTED PREVIOUSLY OUR EARLY SEED

01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:07.882 region:rollup2
STAGE SERIES A SERIES B..

01:38:05.413 --> 01:38:10.518 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:12.086 region:rollup2
YES MA'AM.

01:38:10.518 --> 01:38:13.888 region:rollup2
SO IT KIND OF GOES BACK TO THE

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:15.923 region:rollup2
QUESTION I ASKED YOU ABOUT. OF

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.691 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE'S SOMEONE A

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:19.594 region:rollup2
MINIMAL.

01:38:16.691 --> 01:38:22.630 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT.

01:38:19.594 --> 01:38:24.332 region:rollup2
I. YOU SAID NINE THE MENU OR

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:26.067 region:rollup2
EXPECT INTO. YOU KNOW REALLY

01:38:24.332 --> 01:38:28.569 region:rollup2
INCREASE THAT WITH WHAT ALL THE

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:30.304 region:rollup2
OTHER START UPS AND SO FORTH

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:32.507 region:rollup2
RIGHT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW HOW

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:33.541 region:rollup2
ARE WE LOOKING AT MANAGING THAT

01:38:32.507 --> 01:38:35.376 region:rollup2
IN WHO WOULD MANAGE THEM I MEAN

01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:37.345 region:rollup2
I SORT OF IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:40.047 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER. GLOBALLY HOW DO YOU

01:38:37.345 --> 01:38:40.248 region:rollup2
MANAGE THAT THE SKINNY MANAGED

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:41.082 region:rollup2
COME.

01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:43.518 region:rollup2
.

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:44.519 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR WORK WITH THE FAA

01:38:43.518 --> 01:38:47.221 region:rollup2
YES.

01:38:44.519 --> 01:38:49.290 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T WHERE WE ARE TODAY

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:50.792 region:rollup2
IN SPACES MUCH LIKE WHERE WE

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:52.794 region:rollup2
WERE IN AVIATION.

01:38:50.792 --> 01:38:54.362 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY AROUND NINETEEN TWENTY

01:38:52.794 --> 01:38:56.264 region:rollup2
NINETEEN THIRTY THERE'S A GREAT

01:38:54.362 --> 01:38:58.166 region:rollup2
BOOK BY CHARLES LYNN BOOK ABOUT

01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:59.667 region:rollup2
CHARLES WENT BEHIND HIM.

01:38:58.166 --> 01:39:01.135 region:rollup2
AND RURAL LIMBURG ON NORTH TO

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:02.503 region:rollup2
THE ORIENT THAT TALKS ABOUT

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:03.104 region:rollup2
CHARLES LINDBERGH. NORTH TO THE

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:04.906 region:rollup2
ORIENT.

01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:07.608 region:rollup2
.

01:39:04.906 --> 01:39:09.710 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A GREAT BOOK BECAUSE.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:11.078 region:rollup2
IT'S WHILE THE LINDBERGH BABY

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:13.948 region:rollup2
WAS STILL ALIVE BUT IT'S A.

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:15.183 region:rollup2
WITH AMARO FLYING AS THE

01:39:13.948 --> 01:39:17.084 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS AND NAVIGATOR

01:39:15.183 --> 01:39:19.320 region:rollup2
WITH CHARLES LINDBERGH AS HE

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:20.588 region:rollup2
FLIES FROM NEW YORK A TO THE

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.789 region:rollup2
ORIENT LOOKING FOR ROUTES FOR

01:39:20.588 --> 01:39:24.458 region:rollup2
PAN AM.

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:26.227 region:rollup2
AVIATION IN THE NINETEEN.

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:28.596 region:rollup2
THIRTIES WAS IN A VERY PRIMITIVE

01:39:26.227 --> 01:39:31.332 region:rollup2
STATE TODAY WITH AVIATION NOT

01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:33.034 region:rollup2
ONLY ARE WE ABLE TO A FIELD.

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:34.168 region:rollup2
.

01:39:33.034 --> 01:39:35.203 region:rollup2
DON'T TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:39:34.168 --> 01:39:37.171 region:rollup2
AIRCRAFT IN THE AIR

01:39:35.203 --> 01:39:38.639 region:rollup2
SIMULTANEOUSLY WE'VE ALSO WORKED

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:40.541 region:rollup2
ON TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS THE

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:42.310 region:rollup2
SEPARATION OF AIRCRAFT TO GO

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.910 region:rollup2
FROM TWO THOUSAND FEET DOWN TO

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:48.316 region:rollup2
ONE THOUSAND WAS THE RACE TO.

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:51.419 region:rollup2
THE MOON AND

01:39:48.316 --> 01:39:54.355 region:rollup2
SO FORTH. AND COMPETITION.

01:39:51.419 --> 01:39:56.991 region:rollup2
AMONGST OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:58.593 region:rollup2
DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING ARE

01:39:56.991 --> 01:40:00.595 region:rollup2
OPEN I MEAN ARE WE FAR AHEAD OF

01:39:58.593 --> 01:40:02.997 region:rollup2

THEIR ASSETS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:27.521 region:rollup2
HOW WE MANAGE ALL THAT IS GOING

01:40:25.453 --> 01:40:29.023 region:rollup2
TO BE A CHALLENGE A FOR THE.

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:30.992 region:rollup2

BROAD SCIENCE COMMUNITY AND.

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:36.851 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:38.552 region:rollup2
THIS ENTREPRENEURIAL THE WHAT

01:42:36.851 --> 01:42:39.820 region:rollup2
ARE WITH ENTREPRENEURS LIKE

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:41.422 region:rollup2
MASTIN SPACE SYSTEMS WHICH IS

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.390 region:rollup2
DOWN A MOJAVE. IN THE

ACTIVITY.

01:42:47.595 --> 01:42:52.066 region:rollup2
IN CLOSING I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:54.668 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES I'VE

01:42:52.066 --> 01:42:56.804 region:rollup2
SEEN A WIDE VARIETY OF STATE.

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:59.006 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO SPACE

01:42:56.804 --> 01:43:01.475 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM ARE VERY ACTIVE

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:04.011 region:rollup2
LIKE GOV OF A SPACE FLORIDA

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:05.446 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS IN A POSITION WHAT'S A

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:07.381 region:rollup2
CANCEL THE SHUTTLE OF WHAT ARE

01:43:05.446 --> 01:43:09.183 region:rollup2
THEY GOING TO DO. WITH IDEA ARE

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:10.885 region:rollup2
TOTALLY UNDER PLAYED A WORKFORCE

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:13.487 region:rollup2
BUT SPACE FLORIDA HAS REALLY

01:43:10.885 --> 01:43:14.021 region:rollup2
BEEN A VERY INTERESTING MODEL

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:16.590 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:18.859 region:rollup2
ENGAGING AND LEADING A SPACE

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:21.462 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THIS IS ALSO.

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:22.763 region:rollup2
TAKEN PLACE IN COLORADO

01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:25.099 region:rollup2
COLORADO HAS A VERY NICELY

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:27.201 region:rollup2
WRITTEN REPORT ABOUT DATA WHAT

01:43:25.099 --> 01:43:29.570 region:rollup2
THEIR ROAD. IS TOUGH FOR SPACE

01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:31.706 region:rollup2
FOR THAT STATE A KENTUCKY SPACE

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:33.874 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE. LA I LIKE

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:36.177 region:rollup2
TO THINK OF RANKING OF STATES IN

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:37.778 region:rollup2
GDP FROM CALIFORNIA NUMBER ONE

01:43:36.177 --> 01:43:39.413 region:rollup2
DOWN TO VERMONT NUMBER FIFTY

01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:40.581 region:rollup2
RECENTLY I MET A COMPANY.

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:42.583 region:rollup2
FOUNDED IN VERMONT THAT WAS

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:43.584 region:rollup2
MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR OF

VERMONT TO.

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:49.123 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED AND TO STAY IN THE

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:52.126 region:rollup2
STATE. KENTUCKY SPACES A GREAT

01:43:49.123 --> 01:43:53.260 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE LED BY CHRIS CAMPBELL OF

01:43:52.126 --> 01:43:54.428 region:rollup2
OF.

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:56.430 region:rollup2
OF HOW THEY'VE EMBRACED BOTH

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:58.132 region:rollup2
SMALL SATELLITES AND WORK ON THE

01:43:56.430 --> 01:44:00.234 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BOB

UP AT MOORHEAD STATE UNIVERSITY.

01:44:03.938 --> 01:44:08.275 region:rollup2
DOWN AND NON DOWN IN KENTUCKY

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:09.643 region:rollup2
NEW YORK SPACE ALLIANCE IS ALSO

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:10.177 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH CITY AND STATE

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:12.747 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS AND SPACE COM IS

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:13.214 region:rollup2
EVENT.

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:15.649 region:rollup2
OUT OF.

01:44:13.214 --> 01:44:17.485 region:rollup2
OUT OF HOUSTON TEXAS HEARING

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:18.753 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WAS A VERY ACTIVE

01:44:17.485 --> 01:44:20.654 region:rollup2
FOLLOWER WHILE I WAS ON THE

01:44:18.753 --> 01:44:21.956 region:rollup2
SOVIET PROGRAM OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:24.925 region:rollup2
SPACE AUTHORITY.

01:44:21.956 --> 01:44:27.461 region:rollup2
BUT I FEEL THAT THAT.

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:28.596 region:rollup2
THAT ORGANIZATION UP PERHAPS

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:30.097 region:rollup2
AND WAS PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT

01:44:28.596 --> 01:44:32.133 region:rollup2
TIME BECAUSE AT THAT TIME WE

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:34.034 region:rollup2
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A GROWING

01:44:32.133 --> 01:44:37.671 region:rollup2
SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. UP

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:39.573 region:rollup2
EFFORT I DO BELIEVE THAT A. ON

01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:43.110 region:rollup2
THIS COMMISSION SHOULD PAY

01:44:39.573 --> 01:44:44.578 region:rollup2
PROPER ATTENTION TO THE GROWING.

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:46.680 region:rollup2
SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP SECTOR

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:48.516 region:rollup2
WHICH IS UNIQUELY CALIFORNIA YOU

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.285 region:rollup2
MAY ASK WHY PEOPLE COME TO

01:44:48.516 --> 01:44:52.453 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR START UPS AND YOU

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:53.921 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S A SIMPLE ANSWER I

01:44:52.453 --> 01:44:55.389 region:rollup2
FORGET WHO WAS YOU KNOW WHY HE

01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:56.724 region:rollup2
ROBBED BANKS. BECAUSE THAT'S

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:57.858 region:rollup2
WHERE THE MONEY IS YOU KNOW

01:44:56.724 --> 01:44:59.393 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS AND

01:44:57.858 --> 01:45:00.895 region:rollup2
SILICON VALLEY BUT SILICON

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:02.029 region:rollup2
VALLEY LEADS IF YOU'LL LOOK AT

01:45:00.895 --> 01:45:04.665 region:rollup2
THE PRICE WATERHOUSE REPORT

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:06.267 region:rollup2
SILICON VALLEY CALIFORNIA LEADS.

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:21.916 region:rollup2
DATA TRISTATE AREA SO WE

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:23.717 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HAVE A LEAD IN THIS

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:25.653 region:rollup2
AND SILICON VALLEY IS. YOUR

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:28.355 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO GAIN A GROWING

01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:30.357 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF FILE OF A MONIES

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:32.426 region:rollup2
FROM LIMITED PARTNERS BUT I FEEL

01:45:30.357 --> 01:45:36.263 region:rollup2

A COUNTRIES ARE LOOKING TO BE

01:45:46.106 --> 01:45:50.077 region:rollup2
ACTIVE PLAYERS IN SPACE I THINK

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:52.179 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO DECIDE

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:52.713 region:rollup2
WHAT SHOULD WE DO IS TODAY THE

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:53.981 region:rollup2
RIGHT TIME TO DO SOMETHING

01:58:36.076 --> 01:58:40.447 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE SPACE INDUSTRY.

01:58:39.012 --> 01:58:41.748 region:rollup2

FOR COMPANIES AS WELL.

01:58:47.587 --> 01:58:50.557 region:rollup2
SO FEDERALLY THERE ARE

01:58:49.155 --> 01:58:52.525 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS TAKING PLACE

01:58:50.557 --> 01:58:54.327 region:rollup2
REGARDING INTEGRATION INTO THE

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:55.562 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM.

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:57.397 region:rollup2
BETTER CLASSIFICATION FOR SPACE

01:58:55.562 --> 01:58:58.632 region:rollup2

CAPABILITIES AND EACH WITH

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:12.712 region:rollup2
VARIOUS STATE SUPPORT.

01:59:11.144 --> 01:59:14.180 region:rollup2
STATES ARE VERY EAGER TO EARN

01:59:12.712 --> 01:59:16.316 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS AND THEY OFFER

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:17.917 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES TO OPERATORS.

01:59:16.316 --> 01:59:19.352 region:rollup2
IT IS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT

01:59:17.917 --> 01:59:20.954 region:rollup2

01:59:22.455 --> 01:59:25.692 region:rollup2
WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES

01:59:24.491 --> 01:59:28.461 region:rollup2

01:59:25.692 --> 01:59:29.095 region:rollup2

FOR THAT ONE.

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:35.902 region:rollup2
SO AND THE FAA DOES NOT TREAT

01:59:34.167 --> 01:59:37.837 region:rollup2

THE SPACEPORT AT VANDERBURGH

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:48.708 region:rollup2
IDEAL FOR LAUNCHING INTO POLAR

02:05:46.973 --> 02:05:50.176 region:rollup2
OR SUN SYNCHRONOUS ORBITS.

02:05:48.708 --> 02:05:51.878 region:rollup2
A POLAR ORBITER IMPORTANT

02:05:50.176 --> 02:05:53.346 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THE SATELLITE ORBITS

POLE. THE EARTH ROTATES BLOW IT.

02:05:55.982 --> 02:05:58.351 region:rollup2
SO OVER THE COURSE OF EACH DAY

INTO SPACE.

02:06:40.193 --> 02:06:43.763 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IT WAS FINANCED USING

02:06:41.861 --> 02:06:45.231 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INVESTMENT DOLLARS WITH

02:06:43.763 --> 02:06:46.632 region:rollup2

02:06:48.034 --> 02:06:51.771 region:rollup2
AND WAS DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE

02:06:49.502 --> 02:06:54.373 region:rollup2
A LARGE VARIETY OF SMALLER CLASS

02:06:51.771 --> 02:06:56.342 region:rollup2

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:57.643 region:rollup2
HOWEVER SINCE ITS INCEPTION THE

SPACEPORT HAS ONLY SUPPORTED

02:06:57.643 --> 02:07:01.214 region:rollup2
NINE LAUNCHES.

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:02.815 region:rollup2
OUR THIS MODEST USED IS MOSTLY

02:07:01.214 --> 02:07:04.717 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTED ATTRIBUTABLE TO A

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:06.953 region:rollup2
LACK OF DEMAND. AND LACK OF A

02:07:06.953 --> 02:07:12.592 region:rollup2
SATELLITE LAUNCH CAPABILITY BUT

02:07:08.621 --> 02:07:14.093 region:rollup2
DEMAND IS CHANGING RAPIDLY.

02:07:12.592 --> 02:07:15.061 region:rollup2
NOT SO SIMILAR TO THE AYE

02:07:14.093 --> 02:07:17.430 region:rollup2

NOT TO OVERCOME THIS BARRIER

02:08:33.339 --> 02:08:36.142 region:rollup2
SEVERAL NEW COMPANIES ARE

02:09:45.411 --> 02:09:48.280 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES WHY

02:09:46.379 --> 02:09:49.682 region:rollup2
ARE THESE COMPANIES INCLINED TO

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.117 region:rollup2
LAUNCH OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:09:49.682 --> 02:09:53.319 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE DO TO GROW THIS

THE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I CAME

02:16:41.126 --> 02:16:45.464 region:rollup2
ON BOARD TO A IS T. WE ONLY HAD

WHAT WE HAVE NOW.

02:16:48.634 --> 02:16:51.804 region:rollup2

YEARS NOW.

02:17:01.647 --> 02:17:05.384 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON WHY WE SENT

02:17:03.649 --> 02:17:07.319 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FROM DC TO CALIFORNIA

02:17:05.384 --> 02:17:08.887 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE THE LINGERIE AND

02:17:07.319 --> 02:17:10.155 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES PICKING UP ARE QUITE

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:11.356 region:rollup2
QUITE FAST.

THE BUDGET FOR TWO OF NINETEEN.

02:17:27.773 --> 02:17:32.578 region:rollup2
GUESS A COMPARISON TO THE REST

02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:34.379 region:rollup2
OF THE FAA WE ARE A VERY SMALL

02:17:32.578 --> 02:17:36.148 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF BUSINESS BUT WE DO

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:37.850 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF WORK IN TERMS OF

02:17:36.148 --> 02:17:39.318 region:rollup2
THE SPACE OPERATIONS THAT ARE

02:17:37.850 --> 02:17:43.322 region:rollup2
CONCURRENT OCCURRING O. POLLUTED

02:17:39.318 --> 02:17:45.757 region:rollup2
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

02:17:43.322 --> 02:17:47.126 region:rollup2
AS FOLLOWS A LIKE SEEING HOW

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:48.761 region:rollup2
BREAKS DOWN THERE ARE THREE

02:17:47.126 --> 02:17:50.329 region:rollup2
MAJOR PHASES IN LICENSING

02:17:48.761 --> 02:17:50.929 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES.

02:17:50.329 --> 02:17:51.964 region:rollup2
THE FREE APPLICATION

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:54.700 region:rollup2
CONSULTATION.

02:17:51.964 --> 02:17:56.502 region:rollup2
LICENSING EVALUATION.

02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:58.871 region:rollup2
APPLICATION ACCEPTANCE AND THEN

02:17:56.502 --> 02:18:00.873 region:rollup2
LAUNCH OPERATIONS.

02:17:58.871 --> 02:18:02.975 region:rollup2
THE VERY TOP ERA THERE IS TO

02:18:00.873 --> 02:18:04.243 region:rollup2
THREE ITEMS SPEAKING.

02:18:02.975 --> 02:18:05.644 region:rollup2
AND.

02:18:04.243 --> 02:18:07.179 region:rollup2
.

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.780 region:rollup2
SO I WAS GONNA GO TO THE

02:18:07.179 --> 02:18:09.014 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT CAME UP EARLIER

02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:12.151 region:rollup2
FROM.

02:18:09.014 --> 02:18:14.419 region:rollup2
THE MEMBER I THINK SHARON AND

02:18:12.151 --> 02:18:15.687 region:rollup2
ASKED ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR WHAT

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:17.322 region:rollup2
HOW WE INCORPORATE LAUNCHES INTO

02:18:15.687 --> 02:18:18.323 region:rollup2
NAZ.

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:20.025 region:rollup2
THEY ARE DOZEN AGREEMENT THAT'S

02:18:18.323 --> 02:18:21.627 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY THE APPLICANT TO.

02:18:20.025 --> 02:18:24.596 region:rollup2
.

02:18:21.627 --> 02:18:26.431 region:rollup2
COULD GET HAVE FOR.

02:18:24.596 --> 02:18:28.734 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT TO THE LAST WHICH IS

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:31.670 region:rollup2
A LOW A LOT OF AGREEMENT. AND A

02:18:28.734 --> 02:18:34.406 region:rollup2
TF ARE IT'S TYPICALLY ISSUE. TO

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:36.341 region:rollup2
SENATE SANTOS AEROSPACE TO AVOID

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:37.309 region:rollup2
ANY IMPACT TO THE AIRCRAFT IN

02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:39.077 region:rollup2
DESTIN AREA.

02:18:37.309 --> 02:18:41.013 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT IS THE THE

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:42.748 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IT

02:18:41.013 --> 02:18:43.982 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE IT'S A. PRETTY A

02:18:42.748 --> 02:18:45.651 region:rollup2
RELIABLE SOURCE OF OF

02:18:43.982 --> 02:18:47.119 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT THE LOCAL AIR

02:18:45.651 --> 02:18:48.687 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC CENTER HAS IN HIS

02:18:47.119 --> 02:18:50.322 region:rollup2
POSSESSION. DONE THE VARIOUS

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:51.957 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS THAT THEY CAN USE IT

02:18:50.322 --> 02:18:53.158 region:rollup2
SENT OUT THEIR SPACE NOW

02:18:51.957 --> 02:18:54.726 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS A VERY VALID ONE WE

02:18:53.158 --> 02:18:56.228 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A T.

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:57.796 region:rollup2
O. ATTRACT ORGANIZATION TO

02:18:56.228 --> 02:18:58.864 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR

02:18:57.796 --> 02:19:00.799 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

02:18:58.864 --> 02:19:02.634 region:rollup2
I'M NOT A PROBLEM WE WE

02:19:00.799 --> 02:19:03.368 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE. THAT THE LOTTERY TO

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:04.770 region:rollup2
PICK UP.

02:19:03.368 --> 02:19:06.572 region:rollup2
I THINK THE TIMING OF IT IS

02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:07.272 region:rollup2
KIND UNCERTAIN BUT YOU CAN SEE

02:19:06.572 --> 02:19:08.674 region:rollup2
IT COMING.

02:19:07.272 --> 02:19:11.143 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

02:19:08.674 --> 02:19:11.810 region:rollup2
IS IS OUR IS DUE DILIGENCE TO

02:19:11.143 --> 02:19:13.745 region:rollup2
START TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS

02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:14.780 region:rollup2
MORE AND SEWER INTERACTING WITH

02:19:13.745 --> 02:19:16.415 region:rollup2
A TEAL.

02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:17.950 region:rollup2
AS OFTEN AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE

02:19:16.415 --> 02:19:20.619 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR ISSUES.

02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:21.954 region:rollup2
WITHIN PACK AND AIR SPACE DOES

02:19:20.619 --> 02:19:24.189 region:rollup2
AS IT EXISTS TODAY.

02:19:21.954 --> 02:19:26.391 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALK

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:27.492 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO IS THE POLICY REVIEW

02:19:26.391 --> 02:19:29.595 region:rollup2
PALER REVIEW.

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:31.663 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY ALL

02:19:29.595 --> 02:19:32.998 region:rollup2
PIECES OF THE VALUATION. SO THE

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:34.733 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT CAME UP EARLIER

02:19:32.998 --> 02:19:36.969 region:rollup2
HAS ALL ALL HAVE GONE THROUGH

02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:38.337 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS FOR OBTAINING A

02:19:36.969 --> 02:19:39.871 region:rollup2
LICENSE FOR LUNCH SAY. THE

02:19:38.337 --> 02:19:40.973 region:rollup2
PAYING A LICENSE FOR A LAUNCH

02:19:39.871 --> 02:19:42.874 region:rollup2
VEHICLE.

02:19:40.973 --> 02:19:44.610 region:rollup2
AND IN THE VERY RIGHT SOUTH OF

02:19:42.874 --> 02:19:46.745 region:rollup2
THAT DIET LINE THERE WE HAVE

02:19:44.610 --> 02:19:47.913 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL COMPLIANCE

02:19:46.745 --> 02:19:48.113 region:rollup2
MONITORING SAGE.

02:19:47.913 --> 02:19:49.481 region:rollup2
WHERE?

02:19:48.113 --> 02:19:50.983 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:19:49.481 --> 02:19:52.251 region:rollup2
SAFETY INSPECTORS ACTUALLY SIT

02:19:50.983 --> 02:19:53.585 region:rollup2
ON CONSOLE FOR ALL OF THE

02:19:52.251 --> 02:19:55.520 region:rollup2
VARIOUS MISSIONS

02:19:53.585 --> 02:19:57.289 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THE CAPACITY A

02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:04.963 region:rollup2
LICENSE AND. AND REPUTATION MADE

02:19:57.289 --> 02:20:07.332 region:rollup2
AN APPLICATION.

02:20:04.963 --> 02:20:09.868 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF

02:20:07.332 --> 02:20:11.436 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CREDITOR PATH TO LOOK

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:13.171 region:rollup2
LIKE IN THE FUTURE.

02:20:11.436 --> 02:20:15.874 region:rollup2
AND CURRENTLY HAS A SENSE TODAY

02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:17.576 region:rollup2
SO. RIGHT NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY

02:20:15.874 --> 02:20:19.478 region:rollup2
INVOLVED AND CONCERNED WITH JUST

02:20:17.576 --> 02:20:20.312 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC SAFETY EXPECT OF THESE

02:20:19.478 --> 02:20:22.014 region:rollup2
LAUNCHES.

02:20:20.312 --> 02:20:23.081 region:rollup2
FROM VARIOUS PLACES ALL OVER

02:20:22.014 --> 02:20:25.450 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY AND WORLD.

02:20:23.081 --> 02:20:25.984 region:rollup2
I THE SECOND PHASE THAT WE ARE

02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:28.153 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATING HIS OCCUPANT

02:20:25.984 --> 02:20:30.155 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

02:20:28.153 --> 02:20:32.324 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A

02:20:30.155 --> 02:20:34.459 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE ONCE SEE

02:20:32.324 --> 02:20:36.128 region:rollup2
MORE TALK MORATORIUM EXPIRES.

02:20:34.459 --> 02:20:38.130 region:rollup2
IF YOU STANDS ARE DEVELOPED WE

02:20:36.128 --> 02:20:40.032 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE THAT HAPPENING.

02:20:38.130 --> 02:20:41.867 region:rollup2
IN IN THE NEAR TERM.

02:20:40.032 --> 02:20:44.503 region:rollup2
ONE THING I DID ONE IMAGE INTO

02:20:41.867 --> 02:20:46.238 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST PHASE IS THAT WE DO

02:20:44.503 --> 02:20:46.705 region:rollup2
HAVE A PART FOR SIXTY HUMAN

02:20:46.238 --> 02:20:48.440 region:rollup2
SPACE FLIGHT REGULATE

02:20:46.705 --> 02:20:50.609 region:rollup2
REGULATION.

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:52.144 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN EFFECT AND ARE OFFERS

02:20:50.609 --> 02:20:53.845 region:rollup2
UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SPACE

02:20:52.144 --> 02:20:56.081 region:rollup2
FLIGHT PARTICIPANTS ON THEIR

02:20:57.215 --> 02:21:02.020 region:rollup2
SPACE OPERATIONS OF FROM THE

02:21:00.085 --> 02:21:03.355 region:rollup2
VARIOUS COMPANIES.

02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:04.856 region:rollup2
AND UP TO THE FAR RIGHT.

02:21:03.355 --> 02:21:06.625 region:rollup2
THERE IS.

02:21:04.856 --> 02:21:08.427 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ANOTHER BOX THEIR

02:21:06.625 --> 02:21:09.961 region:rollup2
MISSION ASSURANCE.

02:21:08.427 --> 02:21:12.164 region:rollup2
WE THINK AT SOME POINT AND I'M

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:13.065 region:rollup2
THINKING MAYBE A DECADE OR SO

02:21:12.164 --> 02:21:15.200 region:rollup2
FROM NOW.

02:21:13.065 --> 02:21:16.668 region:rollup2
WOODSTOCK CERTIFYING THESE UP

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.638 region:rollup2

02:21:16.668 --> 02:21:22.975 region:rollup2
AVIATION IS IS DOING NOW FOR.

02:21:19.638 --> 02:21:23.909 region:rollup2
THE AVIATION WORLD. OF INDEX

02:21:22.975 --> 02:21:25.310 region:rollup2
SAID TIMING IS THAT IT'S NOT

02:21:23.909 --> 02:21:26.778 region:rollup2
SURE. BUT THAT'S KIND OF

02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:27.612 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WE'RE GOING AND TO

02:21:26.778 --> 02:21:29.981 region:rollup2
PREPARE FOR THAT.

02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:32.117 region:rollup2
AS WE GO TO A LICENSING PROCESS

02:21:29.981 --> 02:21:33.385 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING MORE INTO. A

02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:41.619 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE SATELLITE

02:27:40.118 --> 02:27:42.954 region:rollup2
SERVICES HAS BEEN PROVIDED.

02:27:41.619 --> 02:27:45.156 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE.

02:27:42.954 --> 02:27:46.024 region:rollup2
THE TRAIN OF DIPPING IN AND

02:27:45.156 --> 02:27:48.560 region:rollup2
KIND OF COMING UP.

02:27:46.024 --> 02:27:50.128 region:rollup2
WOULD PUT THE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:51.863 region:rollup2
SO THE NAME OF YEARS.

02:27:50.128 --> 02:27:52.931 region:rollup2
THAT'S TYPICALLY DO TO.

02:27:51.863 --> 02:27:55.533 region:rollup2
IF YOU WOULD HAVE SOME COUNTY

02:27:52.931 --> 02:27:56.968 region:rollup2
EVENT IN A AND A OPERATION. THAT

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:57.836 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT AFFECT THE ENTIRE

02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:59.971 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

02:27:57.836 --> 02:28:01.806 region:rollup2
IF AS A COMMON COMPONENT OR

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:03.575 region:rollup2
COMMON INJURY OF COMMON.

02:28:01.806 --> 02:28:05.477 region:rollup2
TYPE OF FLIGHT.

02:28:03.575 --> 02:28:07.545 region:rollup2
A KIND OF. TRICKLES DOWN IN

02:28:05.477 --> 02:28:08.813 region:rollup2
EFFECT INTO INDUSTRY BUT LATELY

02:28:07.545 --> 02:28:10.982 region:rollup2
THAT THE TRAIN HAS BEEN GOING UP

02:28:08.813 --> 02:28:11.750 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN.

02:28:10.982 --> 02:28:14.252 region:rollup2
THAT TYPE OF.

02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:16.287 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WOULD IMPACT THE

02:28:14.252 --> 02:28:16.588 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN INDUSTRY THAT MUCH

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:23.928 region:rollup2
IN AND THE.

02:28:16.588 --> 02:28:25.830 region:rollup2
ELEVEN LATER YEARS.

02:28:23.928 --> 02:28:27.098 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:28.032 region:rollup2
INJURIES IS EXPANDING ITS

02:28:27.098 --> 02:28:30.101 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES.

02:28:28.032 --> 02:28:31.736 region:rollup2
WITH A VARIETY OF LAUNCH

02:28:30.101 --> 02:28:33.705 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS TIM FROM BG.

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:35.573 region:rollup2
HYBRID WING LAUNCH SYSTEM TO

02:28:33.705 --> 02:28:39.244 region:rollup2
BLUE ORIGINS AND SPACEX'S.

02:28:35.573 --> 02:28:41.179 region:rollup2
OF VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND WHOSE

02:28:39.244 --> 02:28:42.380 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR FIRST DAYS LANDINGS

02:28:41.179 --> 02:28:44.015 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO THAT.

02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:45.950 region:rollup2
THE BIGELOW ARIS BIGELOW

02:28:44.015 --> 02:28:47.051 region:rollup2
AEROSPACE WHO MANUFACTURES AND

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:48.052 region:rollup2
DEVELOPS.

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:50.455 region:rollup2
EXPANDABLE SPACE STATIONS OF

02:28:48.052 --> 02:28:52.190 region:rollup2
MODULES.

02:28:50.455 --> 02:28:54.125 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CHARTER IS A IS A

02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:56.394 region:rollup2
GOOD INDICATOR FOR WHAT'S

02:28:54.125 --> 02:28:58.029 region:rollup2
HAPPENING NOW IN INDUSTRY. AND

02:28:56.394 --> 02:29:00.665 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THE EXCITING.

02:28:58.029 --> 02:29:01.766 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL SPACE ADVENTURE

02:29:00.665 --> 02:29:03.868 region:rollup2
OPERATES NAKED THAT'S.

02:29:01.766 --> 02:29:05.737 region:rollup2
PROBABLY DOWN. A LITTLE BIT BUT

02:29:03.868 --> 02:29:06.171 region:rollup2
SURELY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

02:29:05.737 --> 02:29:11.643 region:rollup2
CONSIDER HAPPENING.

02:29:06.171 --> 02:29:13.344 region:rollup2
AND A NEAR TERM.

02:29:11.643 --> 02:29:13.678 region:rollup2
SO INVESTMENTS IN NEW MARKETS IN

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:18.183 region:rollup2
AND VEHICLES.

02:29:13.678 --> 02:29:19.651 region:rollup2
.

02:29:18.183 --> 02:29:22.120 region:rollup2
I JUST LIKE TO SUMMARIZE BUSTING

02:29:19.651 --> 02:29:23.788 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCIAL SPACE HAS BEEN.

02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:25.390 region:rollup2
SEEN RECORD INVESTMENT OVER LAST

02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:26.858 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS.

02:29:25.390 --> 02:29:29.627 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND

02:29:26.858 --> 02:29:31.362 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN A STUDY FOUND PRIVATE

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:33.531 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN COMMERCIAL SPACE.

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:34.098 region:rollup2
OVERALL HAS INCREASED.

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:35.767 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THE COMPANIES

02:29:34.098 --> 02:29:37.335 region:rollup2
RECEIVING FUNDING ARE BASED IN

02:29:35.767 --> 02:29:39.604 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:41.339 region:rollup2
GOT INCLUDING THE VENTURE

02:29:39.604 --> 02:29:42.474 region:rollup2
VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS THEY'RE

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:48.613 region:rollup2
GETTING HEAVILY AYE INVOLVED

02:29:42.474 --> 02:29:50.215 region:rollup2
LATELY.

02:29:48.613 --> 02:29:52.717 region:rollup2
A COMMERCIAL MONEY A GIVEN

02:29:50.215 --> 02:29:54.886 region:rollup2
REVENUE FROM A GLOBAL SPACE

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:56.654 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY WAS ABOUT.

02:29:54.886 --> 02:29:57.956 region:rollup2
TOWARD TO SIXTY BILLION IN TWO

02:29:56.654 --> 02:30:00.525 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

02:29:57.956 --> 02:30:01.893 region:rollup2
THE TALK SHOWS THAT MOST OF THE

02:30:00.525 --> 02:30:03.261 region:rollup2
MONEY COMES FROM.

02:30:01.893 --> 02:30:03.895 region:rollup2
SATELLITE SERVICE OF GROUND

02:30:03.261 --> 02:30:05.797 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT.

02:30:03.895 --> 02:30:08.700 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT

02:30:05.797 --> 02:30:09.868 region:rollup2
LAUNCHES IS ONLY A FRACTION OF

02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:12.270 region:rollup2
THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY BILLION

02:30:09.868 --> 02:30:15.573 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR. COMMERCIAL MONEY.

02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:17.242 region:rollup2
IN THIS SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT

02:30:15.573 --> 02:30:18.910 region:rollup2
LAUNCH AN AIDS TEES MISSION.

02:30:17.242 --> 02:30:20.245 region:rollup2
IS RELATED AND INFLUENCES THE

02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:20.645 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

02:30:20.245 --> 02:30:22.146 region:rollup2
SUCCESS AND AND.

02:30:20.645 --> 02:30:23.715 region:rollup2
.

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:24.515 region:rollup2
NO SWORDS AT THE MONEY HOUSE

02:30:23.715 --> 02:30:26.184 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE.

02:30:24.515 --> 02:30:31.189 region:rollup2
ADMIT INTO THE THE WHOLE

02:30:26.184 --> 02:30:33.791 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:30:31.189 --> 02:30:35.093 region:rollup2
FAA AND NATIONAL GOES SO THAT

02:30:33.791 --> 02:30:36.694 region:rollup2
THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS

02:30:35.093 --> 02:30:39.531 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY.

02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:40.131 region:rollup2
STALKING WITH VARIOUS COMPANIES

02:30:39.531 --> 02:30:41.532 region:rollup2

THAT.

02:30:54.479 --> 02:30:57.282 region:rollup2
THINK THEY HAVE A BUSINESS CASE

02:30:55.813 --> 02:31:02.620 region:rollup2
OVERSEAS ARE THAT WE CAN HELP

02:30:57.282 --> 02:31:04.556 region:rollup2
WITH.

02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:06.457 region:rollup2
THIS CHART SHOWS AND EXPAND THE

02:31:04.556 --> 02:31:08.326 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT OF WORLDWIDE INCLUDING

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:09.928 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING PROPOSED GLOBAL

NEW ZEALAND.

02:31:11.329 --> 02:31:15.466 region:rollup2
BELOW US BELOW OSTROWY THERE AS

02:31:14.299 --> 02:31:16.734 region:rollup2
A NEW LAUNCH COMPANY AT THINK

02:31:15.466 --> 02:31:19.337 region:rollup2
WAS MUCH EARLIER.

02:31:16.734 --> 02:31:21.072 region:rollup2
BUT BASS OTHER CALIFORNIA.

02:31:19.337 --> 02:31:21.606 region:rollup2
WITH ROCKET LAB.

02:31:21.072 --> 02:31:24.409 region:rollup2
OF THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF.

02:31:21.606 --> 02:31:25.810 region:rollup2
.

02:31:24.409 --> 02:31:27.312 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS LATELY AND

02:31:25.810 --> 02:31:29.747 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORKING A. S..

02:31:27.312 --> 02:31:30.848 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR UPCOMING MISSION AND

02:31:29.747 --> 02:31:32.650 region:rollup2
IS DOING.

02:31:30.848 --> 02:31:34.152 region:rollup2
AND IN THE COMING MONTHS.

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:37.121 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WORKING WITH UNITED

UK ITALY AND BRAZIL.

02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:42.727 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT COMMERCIAL

02:31:40.959 --> 02:31:49.500 region:rollup2
LAUNCH SITES IN THE VARIOUS.

02:31:42.727 --> 02:31:51.736 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:52.537 region:rollup2
SO THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR

02:31:51.736 --> 02:31:54.272 region:rollup2
A IS T..

02:31:52.537 --> 02:31:55.707 region:rollup2
IS ANOTHER AREA OF

02:31:54.272 --> 02:31:57.942 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION

02:31:55.707 --> 02:31:59.777 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A. S. T. AND THE

02:31:57.942 --> 02:32:02.580 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SPACE INDUSTRY.

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:04.449 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW STAMP IS IS A MEMBER.

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:07.352 region:rollup2
NASA AMES IS AN ASSOCIATE

02:32:04.449 --> 02:32:09.053 region:rollup2
MEMBER USC IS WORKING ON

02:32:07.352 --> 02:32:10.588 region:rollup2
BECOMING AN AFFILIATE MEMBER I

02:32:09.053 --> 02:32:12.156 region:rollup2
AM BERKELEY HAS SHOWN A LOT A

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:15.059 region:rollup2
LOT OF INTEREST RECENTLY.

02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:16.494 region:rollup2
WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM.

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:18.329 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THE TOP FOUR ITEM

02:32:16.494 --> 02:32:19.864 region:rollup2
ZERO THE FOCAL POINTS AEROSPACE

02:32:18.329 --> 02:32:21.132 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SPACE POOR

02:32:19.864 --> 02:32:23.768 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS.

SPACE TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES

02:32:23.768 --> 02:32:27.538 region:rollup2
IN SPACE FLIGHT AND INITIATE

02:32:25.103 --> 02:32:29.774 region:rollup2
VIABILITY. AND THAT THAT REALLY

02:32:27.538 --> 02:32:31.542 region:rollup2
SPEAKS TO THAT THE VARIOUS.

02:32:29.774 --> 02:32:33.011 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE

02:32:31.542 --> 02:32:34.445 region:rollup2
FOR A MEMBER OF THEY WERE TO

02:32:33.011 --> 02:32:35.913 region:rollup2
BECOME INVOLVED A HALF INTEREST

02:32:34.445 --> 02:32:37.548 region:rollup2
IN.

02:32:35.913 --> 02:32:47.658 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE PRESENTING HERE.

02:32:37.548 --> 02:32:50.461 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CO E. PROGRAM.

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:51.262 region:rollup2
SO LOOKING AHEAD I THINK THE TO

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:53.264 region:rollup2
TAKE AWAY IS THAT.

02:32:51.262 --> 02:32:54.599 region:rollup2
.

02:32:53.264 --> 02:32:57.335 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS WAS

02:32:54.599 --> 02:32:58.503 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING WAYS IS T. AND THE

02:32:57.335 --> 02:33:00.705 region:rollup2
COP FOUR YEAR.

02:32:58.503 --> 02:33:03.007 region:rollup2
AEROSPACE COMMITTEE COMMISSION

02:33:00.705 --> 02:33:05.009 region:rollup2
COULD INTERACT IN SUPPORT OF

02:33:03.007 --> 02:33:06.677 region:rollup2
OTHER EACH OTHER'S EFFORT.

02:33:05.009 --> 02:33:09.981 region:rollup2
OUR WILL TO REFORM EFFORTS.

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:11.349 region:rollup2
FOR THE ARTICLE ON THE WAY AND

02:33:09.981 --> 02:33:12.950 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THIS A MINUTE AGO.

02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:14.252 region:rollup2
AIRSPACE ACCESS SPACE PORTS

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:17.121 region:rollup2
INNER.

02:33:14.252 --> 02:33:18.022 region:rollup2
GRETA REFORMS ARE THE THREE ARCS

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:19.757 region:rollup2
THAT ARE.

02:33:18.022 --> 02:33:21.292 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN PICKED UP THE PACE

02:33:19.757 --> 02:33:23.127 region:rollup2
HAVE GREAT INTERACTION WITH

02:33:21.292 --> 02:33:25.263 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY I THINK IT SERVED ITS

02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:26.798 region:rollup2
PURPOSE. THE GOAL NOW IS TO GET

02:33:25.263 --> 02:33:28.866 region:rollup2
THE RULE MAKING NOW. THAT.

02:33:26.798 --> 02:33:30.868 region:rollup2
REALLY ADDRESSES SOME OF THE

02:33:28.866 --> 02:33:32.470 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WERE. DISCUSSED

02:33:30.868 --> 02:33:34.205 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A. S. T. AN ENTRY

02:33:32.470 --> 02:33:35.707 region:rollup2
REGARDING OF LAUNCHING

02:33:34.205 --> 02:33:38.476 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY STREAMLINING.

02:33:35.707 --> 02:33:41.245 region:rollup2
AND CAN MAKE IN THE THE.

02:33:38.476 --> 02:33:44.982 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS MORE MORE EFFICIENT.

02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:47.151 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TODAY'S INDUSTRY.

02:33:44.982 --> 02:33:48.453 region:rollup2
OF POTENTIAL FIAC INTERACTION

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:51.055 region:rollup2
WITH THE CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE

02:33:48.453 --> 02:33:52.924 region:rollup2
COMMISSION. OF SO WE HAVE

02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:54.358 region:rollup2
IN THAT THE TO SUPPOSE THERE ARE

02:33:52.924 --> 02:33:55.727 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT. ONE OF THE WITH

02:36:09.694 --> 02:36:14.332 region:rollup2
GRANTS.

CRACKED SO ó AS A GENERAL

FIFTH IT WAS A FIFTY FIFTY

02:36:32.350 --> 02:36:35.686 region:rollup2

SO THE THE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST

02:36:47.398 --> 02:36:51.168 region:rollup2
TODAY THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:36:48.1000 --> 02:36:53.371 region:rollup2

ROBERT WELL REPRESENTED BY.

02:37:00.912 --> 02:37:03.347 region:rollup2
A CONGRESSMAN AND.

02:37:01.312 --> 02:37:04.181 region:rollup2
.

02:37:03.347 --> 02:37:06.117 region:rollup2
MCCARTHY.

02:37:04.181 --> 02:37:07.752 region:rollup2

SO I AM I US FROM DEALING WITH

02:37:11.889 --> 02:37:15.660 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE CURRENTLY AND.

02:37:13.858 --> 02:37:17.128 region:rollup2
I WASN'T SURE WHETHER I WOULD

02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:18.763 region:rollup2
MAKE ANY PROGRESS WITHIN THE FAA

02:37:17.128 --> 02:37:20.831 region:rollup2
SO MY FIRST CALL WAS TO HIS

02:37:18.763 --> 02:37:22.466 region:rollup2
OFFICE. OF EXPLAINING THE

02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:24.135 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE AND SAYING I NEED I

02:37:22.466 --> 02:37:25.336 region:rollup2
NEED HELP GETTING SOME KIND OF

02:37:24.135 --> 02:37:28.472 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY.

02:37:25.336 --> 02:37:34.278 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT OTHER

02:37:28.472 --> 02:37:35.279 region:rollup2
AVENUES FOR US RIGHT NOW.

02:37:34.278 --> 02:37:37.715 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE.

02:37:35.279 --> 02:37:38.916 region:rollup2
.

02:37:37.715 --> 02:37:39.150 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY ARE YOU

02:37:38.916 --> 02:37:41.585 region:rollup2
ARE YOU.

02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:43.621 region:rollup2
.

02:37:41.585 --> 02:37:46.991 region:rollup2
YEAH ARE YOU SUGGESTING LIKE

02:37:43.621 --> 02:37:47.925 region:rollup2
BOND FUNDS FROM THE STATE.

02:37:46.991 --> 02:37:51.195 region:rollup2
AS ODESSA SOURCE OF AN.

02:37:47.925 --> 02:37:52.763 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE.

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:55.199 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE EASIEST FOR US IS

02:37:52.763 --> 02:37:57.368 region:rollup2
TO JUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE

02:37:55.199 --> 02:38:00.071 region:rollup2
OUT ARE A REGULAR BANK CLONE

02:37:57.368 --> 02:38:02.473 region:rollup2
JUST SAYS MOST ENTITIES CARE ON?

02:38:00.071 --> 02:38:03.674 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE REGION OR IN ITS

02:38:02.473 --> 02:38:05.609 region:rollup2
IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:07.545 region:rollup2
RAISE BOND MONEY AND WE HAVE

02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:09.714 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL DISTRICT AND NOT A

02:38:07.545 --> 02:38:12.283 region:rollup2
LOT OF A PROPERTY OWNERS.

02:38:09.714 --> 02:38:13.918 region:rollup2
ARE PRESENT IN THAT DISTRICT SO

02:38:12.283 --> 02:38:15.453 region:rollup2
MOST THINGS MOST THINGS GET

02:38:13.918 --> 02:38:16.721 region:rollup2
VOTED DOWN TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:38:15.453 --> 02:38:17.855 region:rollup2
ARE STREET LIGHTS WERE RIPPED

02:38:16.721 --> 02:38:19.256 region:rollup2
OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE VOTED DOWN

02:38:17.855 --> 02:38:20.825 region:rollup2
HAVE EVERY TRIED.

02:38:19.256 --> 02:38:21.859 region:rollup2
WELL WE HAVE NOT TRIED RAISING

02:38:20.825 --> 02:38:23.594 region:rollup2
BONDS FOR THE AIRPORT.

02:38:21.859 --> 02:38:24.662 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T THINK IT

02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:27.131 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A FRUITFUL EFFORT.

02:38:24.662 --> 02:38:29.233 region:rollup2
AND VERY LABOR INTENSIVE.

02:38:27.131 --> 02:38:30.935 region:rollup2
THE OTHER AVENUE THAT WE WERE

02:38:29.233 --> 02:38:32.403 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED TO PURSUE WAS THROUGH

02:38:30.935 --> 02:38:34.572 region:rollup2
AYE BANK AND.

02:38:32.403 --> 02:38:36.507 region:rollup2
AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS

02:38:34.572 --> 02:38:38.876 region:rollup2
OF PURSUING AYE BANK.

02:38:36.507 --> 02:38:40.778 region:rollup2
AYE IT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

02:38:38.876 --> 02:38:42.013 region:rollup2
THAT I HAD ON THE TABLE AT THAT.

02:38:40.778 --> 02:38:44.215 region:rollup2
AT THE MOMENT.

02:38:42.013 --> 02:38:46.050 region:rollup2
WAS PURSUING THE I THINK FUNDS

02:38:44.215 --> 02:38:48.519 region:rollup2
AND BY THE TIME I GOT THE

02:38:46.050 --> 02:38:50.755 region:rollup2
INVITATION TO APPLY FOR THE I

02:38:48.519 --> 02:38:53.290 region:rollup2
HATE FUNDS. THAT OPPORTUNITY

02:38:50.755 --> 02:38:54.458 region:rollup2
DRIED UP. SO I ADDED ESSENTIALLY

02:38:53.290 --> 02:38:57.661 region:rollup2
START OVER.

02:38:54.458 --> 02:39:00.664 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT PROCESS WAS WAS

02:38:57.661 --> 02:39:02.366 region:rollup2
ALSO QUITE FRUSTRATING WE THIRDS

02:39:00.664 --> 02:39:03.367 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN OF LACKEY AT ONE

02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:05.069 region:rollup2
POINT INTRODUCED SOME

02:39:03.367 --> 02:39:07.004 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HELP US

02:39:05.069 --> 02:39:07.872 region:rollup2
WITH THE GETTING A NEGOTIABLE

02:39:07.004 --> 02:39:08.973 region:rollup2
NOTE.

02:39:07.872 --> 02:39:11.442 region:rollup2
A AND.

02:39:08.973 --> 02:39:13.477 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY DIDN'T DIDN'T SEEM

02:39:11.442 --> 02:39:14.545 region:rollup2
TO PUSH BACK BUT THE SENATE DID.

02:39:13.477 --> 02:39:16.447 region:rollup2
SO IT GOT HELD UP AND SENATE

02:39:14.545 --> 02:39:18.149 region:rollup2
FINANCE COMMITTEE. AND THEY CAME

02:39:16.447 --> 02:39:19.717 region:rollup2
BACK TO US BASICALLY SAYING WE

02:39:18.149 --> 02:39:20.885 region:rollup2
HAD WE HAD NOT PURSUE ALL

02:39:19.717 --> 02:39:22.620 region:rollup2
AVENUES.

02:39:20.885 --> 02:39:23.788 region:rollup2
WE COULD GO THROUGH AN

02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:25.022 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BANKER WE COULD DO

02:39:23.788 --> 02:39:27.158 region:rollup2
ALL THESE OTHER OPTIONS BUT THE

02:39:25.022 --> 02:39:29.293 region:rollup2
REALITY IS. EVERY OTHER OPTION

02:39:27.158 --> 02:39:30.995 region:rollup2
IS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR US AS A

02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:32.396 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ENTITY. AND WHERE IT

02:39:30.995 --> 02:39:33.864 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL

02:39:32.396 --> 02:39:35.466 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION.

02:39:33.864 --> 02:39:36.801 region:rollup2
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A

02:39:35.466 --> 02:39:38.335 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL BANK LOAN WITH A

02:39:36.801 --> 02:39:40.171 region:rollup2
WITH A NORMAL INTEREST RATE IS

02:39:38.335 --> 02:39:40.805 region:rollup2
JUST TOO EXPENSIVE AN OPTION FOR

02:39:40.171 --> 02:39:42.773 region:rollup2
US.

02:39:40.805 --> 02:39:43.741 region:rollup2
SO ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD BUILD

02:39:42.773 --> 02:39:45.009 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE PASS

02:39:43.741 --> 02:39:46.143 region:rollup2
THROUGH THOSE COST TO OUR

02:39:45.009 --> 02:39:47.645 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS.

02:39:46.143 --> 02:39:49.046 region:rollup2
AND AND THOSE COSTS ARE TO

02:39:47.645 --> 02:39:51.482 region:rollup2
BECOME VERY COST PROHIBITIVE

02:39:49.046 --> 02:39:52.516 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY.

02:39:51.482 --> 02:39:54.218 region:rollup2
SO YOU WOULD BE LESS THAN OF

02:39:52.516 --> 02:39:56.120 region:rollup2
ACTION TO BE ABLE TO.

02:39:54.218 --> 02:39:57.021 region:rollup2
TO GET A A.

02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:58.856 region:rollup2
STANDARD COMMERCIAL BANK LOANS

02:39:57.021 --> 02:40:00.458 region:rollup2
YES.

02:39:58.856 --> 02:40:03.561 region:rollup2
THE THEIR PC TWO TWO FIVE FIVE

02:40:00.458 --> 02:40:05.329 region:rollup2
SEVEN LIMITS ITS ITS SPECIFIC

02:40:03.561 --> 02:40:06.764 region:rollup2

BORROWING TO FIVE HUNDRED

02:40:06.764 --> 02:40:09.366 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR NO GOOD FOR

02:40:08.532 --> 02:40:14.238 region:rollup2
NEGOTIABLE NOTES SETS THE

02:40:09.366 --> 02:40:18.375 region:rollup2
STANDARD BANK LOAN.

02:40:14.238 --> 02:40:20.077 region:rollup2
.

02:40:18.375 --> 02:40:21.045 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE FOR.

02:40:20.077 --> 02:40:23.013 region:rollup2
I A NO WE STILL HAVE

02:40:21.045 --> 02:40:25.249 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES FROM.

02:40:23.013 --> 02:40:25.483 region:rollup2
VERSION AND.

02:40:25.249 --> 02:40:26.383 region:rollup2
SPACEX.

02:40:25.483 --> 02:40:29.253 region:rollup2
.

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:29.920 region:rollup2
BUT THEM.

02:40:29.253 --> 02:40:32.756 region:rollup2
TELL I ASK YOU FIRST.

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:33.257 region:rollup2
.

02:40:32.756 --> 02:40:35.159 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP

02:40:33.257 --> 02:40:35.326 region:rollup2
BETWEEN?

02:40:35.159 --> 02:40:37.828 region:rollup2
THE.

02:40:35.326 --> 02:40:39.130 region:rollup2
.

02:40:37.828 --> 02:40:40.464 region:rollup2
WHERE THESE COMPANIES ARE

02:40:39.130 --> 02:40:41.332 region:rollup2
LAUNCHING AND WHERE THEY WOULD

02:40:40.464 --> 02:40:42.399 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE?

02:40:41.332 --> 02:40:44.201 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:46.070 region:rollup2
ROCKETS

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:48.139 region:rollup2
SO THE MORE MANUFACTURING IN

02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:50.341 region:rollup2
MOJAVE SO TAKE VIRGIN ORDER FOR

02:40:48.139 --> 02:40:52.076 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE VIRGIN ORBIT.

02:40:50.341 --> 02:40:53.777 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING THEIR ROCKY

02:40:52.076 --> 02:40:55.012 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING IN LONG BEACH.

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:56.647 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING ALL THEIR ROCKET

02:40:55.012 --> 02:40:58.082 region:rollup2
TESTING IN MOJAVE AND THEY

02:40:56.647 --> 02:40:59.617 region:rollup2
INTEND TO DO LAUNCHES FROM

02:40:58.082 --> 02:41:01.252 region:rollup2
HARVEY AS WELL.

02:40:59.617 --> 02:41:02.052 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S SO THEIR SEVEN

02:41:01.252 --> 02:41:03.821 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN IS NOT HOUSED IN

02:41:02.052 --> 02:41:05.456 region:rollup2
MOJAVE BUT WHEN THEY GET READY

02:41:03.821 --> 02:41:06.957 region:rollup2
TO DO WILL LAUNCH THEIR THIS I'M

02:41:05.456 --> 02:41:07.491 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVENTY MOHAVE.

02:41:06.957 --> 02:41:09.093 region:rollup2
THEY BRING THE ROCKETS TO

02:41:07.491 --> 02:41:11.462 region:rollup2
MOJAVE.

02:41:09.093 --> 02:41:11.929 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THEY MAY HAVE ON SITE

02:41:11.462 --> 02:41:13.164 region:rollup2
IS JUST AN EASY WAY TO

02:41:11.929 --> 02:41:15.032 region:rollup2
TRANSPORT.

02:41:13.164 --> 02:41:16.567 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY WOULD CONDUCT

02:41:15.032 --> 02:41:18.369 region:rollup2
THEIR LUNCHES FROM THERE.

02:41:16.567 --> 02:41:20.070 region:rollup2
THEY'RE INTERESTED POTENTIALLY

02:41:18.369 --> 02:41:21.405 region:rollup2
AN EXPANDING OF FOOTPRINT IN

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:22.973 region:rollup2
MOJAVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEVERAL

02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:24.675 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES SAID ARE DRIVING UP

02:41:22.973 --> 02:41:27.645 region:rollup2
FROM LONG BEACH REGULARLY. SO

02:41:24.675 --> 02:41:28.579 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT TEMPORARY STRUCTURES

02:41:27.645 --> 02:41:30.281 region:rollup2
SET OUT FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AND

02:41:28.579 --> 02:41:31.749 region:rollup2
THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE A AND ACTUAL

02:41:30.281 --> 02:41:33.284 region:rollup2
FACILITY FOR THEM.

02:41:31.749 --> 02:41:34.451 region:rollup2
.

02:41:33.284 --> 02:41:36.720 region:rollup2
AND A MINIMUM A CONCRETE PAD IS

02:41:34.451 --> 02:41:38.255 region:rollup2
DEDICATED FOR THEIR USE SO.

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:39.390 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THAT THERE ARE STILL

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:40.925 region:rollup2
JUST BE USING OUR EXISTING

02:41:39.390 --> 02:41:43.594 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THEIR LUNCH

02:41:40.925 --> 02:41:45.930 region:rollup2
PROP.

02:41:43.594 --> 02:41:47.064 region:rollup2
I ADMIT I WOULD OPEN UP TO TO

02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:49.767 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE PANELISTS BETTER.

02:41:47.064 --> 02:41:51.135 region:rollup2
MAIN.

02:41:49.767 --> 02:41:53.304 region:rollup2
THIS SEEMS TO LOGISTICALLY MAKE

02:41:51.135 --> 02:41:55.072 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT THERE.

02:41:53.304 --> 02:41:57.575 region:rollup2
YOU'D WANT TO MANUFACTURE. NEAR

02:41:55.072 --> 02:41:57.741 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU'RE LAUNCHING.

02:41:57.575 --> 02:42:00.311 region:rollup2
YES.

02:41:57.741 --> 02:42:01.478 region:rollup2
SO I AM I A DENTAL DEFTLY

02:42:00.311 --> 02:42:02.079 region:rollup2
TOUCHED ON THIS I'M SURE AS WELL

02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:04.548 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:42:02.079 --> 02:42:06.183 region:rollup2
ARE ARE ISSUE REALLY IS WELL

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:08.652 region:rollup2
COUPLE THINGS. THE REMOTE

02:42:06.183 --> 02:42:10.421 region:rollup2
LOCATION WE HAVE IS FAVORABLE TO

02:42:08.652 --> 02:42:11.855 region:rollup2
LAUNCH OPERATIONS BUT NOT SO

02:42:10.421 --> 02:42:12.790 region:rollup2
MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO RECRUITING

02:42:11.855 --> 02:42:15.359 region:rollup2
TALENT.

02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:17.027 region:rollup2
SO AND THE REASON THAT COMPANIES

02:42:15.359 --> 02:42:18.429 region:rollup2
LIKE VIRGIN ORDERFOR INSTANCE

02:42:17.027 --> 02:42:19.930 region:rollup2
ARE LOCATED ALONG THE JUST

02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:21.599 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THEY

02:42:19.930 --> 02:42:23.801 region:rollup2
CAN RECRUIT THE ENGINEERS.

02:42:21.599 --> 02:42:24.635 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THAT ARE WILLING TO DO

02:42:23.801 --> 02:42:26.837 region:rollup2
THOSE JOBS ARE HAPPY TO DO THOSE

02:42:24.635 --> 02:42:27.972 region:rollup2
JOBS IT'S A LOT HARDER TO

02:42:26.837 --> 02:42:29.707 region:rollup2
RECRUIT THAT TALENT TO THE

02:42:27.972 --> 02:42:31.208 region:rollup2
ANTELOPE VALLEY. SO THAT'S

02:42:29.707 --> 02:42:34.612 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST REALITIES ARE

02:42:31.208 --> 02:42:35.446 region:rollup2
LOCATION.

02:42:34.612 --> 02:42:37.615 region:rollup2
YEAH I'D SAY.

02:42:35.446 --> 02:42:38.816 region:rollup2
.

02:42:37.615 --> 02:42:41.151 region:rollup2
SEE CERTAINLY TOUCHED ON.

02:42:38.816 --> 02:42:41.919 region:rollup2
LOGISTICS ISSUES THAT THAT I

02:42:41.151 --> 02:42:43.554 region:rollup2
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AYE

02:42:41.919 --> 02:42:44.755 region:rollup2
AYE MY POINT OUT A FEW EXAMPLES

02:42:43.554 --> 02:42:47.458 region:rollup2
OF SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE

02:42:44.755 --> 02:42:48.692 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING. IN CALIFORNIA BUT

02:42:47.458 --> 02:42:50.060 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TAKING THEIR LAUNCH

02:42:48.692 --> 02:42:51.495 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE.

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:53.831 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO

02:42:51.495 --> 02:42:55.599 region:rollup2
FIRST OR SECOND TYPE LAUNCHES.

02:42:53.831 --> 02:42:57.034 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ALL BASED ON VENTURE

02:42:55.599 --> 02:42:59.270 region:rollup2
CAPITALIST THEY'RE TRYING IT

02:42:57.034 --> 02:43:00.070 region:rollup2
JUST PROVED THEIR SYSTEM. AYE

02:42:59.270 --> 02:43:02.273 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE WHERE THEY CAN SAVE

02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:03.440 region:rollup2
MONEY THEY'RE LOOKING TO SAVE.

02:43:02.273 --> 02:43:06.744 region:rollup2
AND.

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:07.811 region:rollup2
AND SO RIGHT NOW THEY. IF THEY

02:43:06.744 --> 02:43:09.647 region:rollup2
BEEN FACED WITH A WORKMAN THE

02:43:07.811 --> 02:43:12.249 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR TO WITH THIS DECISION.

02:43:09.647 --> 02:43:14.485 region:rollup2
WE WANNA PAY ACTUALLY JUST SIX

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:16.153 region:rollup2
AND TAKE IT TO KODIAK WHERE

02:43:14.485 --> 02:43:17.921 region:rollup2
KODIAK HAS SOME MORE

02:43:16.153 --> 02:43:19.990 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE THE STATE

02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:21.291 region:rollup2
WILL WORK WITH US AND WHERE WE

02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:23.060 region:rollup2
ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH ONE FEDERAL

02:43:21.291 --> 02:43:23.894 region:rollup2
AGENCY THE FAA WHO LICENSE OUR

02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:25.229 region:rollup2
LAUNCH.

02:43:23.894 --> 02:43:26.997 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL DEPARTMENT

02:43:25.229 --> 02:43:29.967 region:rollup2
DEFENSE IN A FEDERAL RANGE.

02:43:26.997 --> 02:43:32.269 region:rollup2
OR DO WE TRADE THAT OFF AND

02:43:29.967 --> 02:43:34.338 region:rollup2
SAVE ON THE JOYSTICKS BUT DAN.

02:43:32.269 --> 02:43:36.106 region:rollup2
HAVE THE INCREASED COSTS OF

02:43:34.338 --> 02:43:37.107 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THE FEDERAL RANGE.

02:43:36.106 --> 02:43:37.641 region:rollup2
AND THAT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ALL

02:43:37.107 --> 02:43:39.243 region:rollup2
CHOOSING TO GO ELSEWHERE.

02:43:37.641 --> 02:43:41.111 region:rollup2
.

02:43:39.243 --> 02:43:41.812 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S SEVERAL OTHER

02:43:41.111 --> 02:43:44.048 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT.

02:43:41.812 --> 02:43:44.715 region:rollup2
SO IN ADDITION TO HAVE A POOR

02:43:44.048 --> 02:43:45.916 region:rollup2
LAUNCH CAPABILITY WHICH I TALKED

02:43:44.715 --> 02:43:47.217 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:43:45.916 --> 02:43:48.852 region:rollup2
I'LL OBVIOUSLY THESE COMPANIES

02:43:47.217 --> 02:43:49.887 region:rollup2
ALSO ONE EQUATORIAL LAUNCH SO

02:43:48.852 --> 02:43:50.954 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT

02:43:49.887 --> 02:43:51.388 region:rollup2
FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA.

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:53.223 region:rollup2
AND.

02:43:51.388 --> 02:43:55.059 region:rollup2
IN THOSE STATES.

02:43:53.223 --> 02:43:56.493 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FLORIDA AS WAS

02:43:55.059 --> 02:43:58.028 region:rollup2
MENTIONED BEFORE SPACE FLORIDA

02:43:56.493 --> 02:43:59.697 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN

02:43:58.028 --> 02:44:00.798 region:rollup2
ATTRACTING BUSINESS THERE'D SO

02:43:59.697 --> 02:44:02.366 region:rollup2
THEY DO MATCHING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:44:00.798 --> 02:44:04.335 region:rollup2
GRANTS.

02:44:02.366 --> 02:44:05.903 region:rollup2
AND SO THE THE EXAMPLE THERE IS

02:44:04.335 --> 02:44:07.404 region:rollup2
YOU GOT TO START A COMPANY WHO

02:44:05.903 --> 02:44:08.839 region:rollup2
WANTS TO DO THEIR FIRST LAUNCH.

02:44:07.404 --> 02:44:10.674 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN EITHER COME TO

02:44:08.839 --> 02:44:11.942 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND.

02:44:10.674 --> 02:44:13.177 region:rollup2
INVEST A BUNCH OF MONEY AND

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:14.578 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED OR YOU

02:44:13.177 --> 02:44:15.979 region:rollup2
GO TO FLORIDAWHERE THE STATE OF

02:44:14.578 --> 02:44:18.015 region:rollup2
FLORIDA WILL INVEST IN YOUR

02:44:15.979 --> 02:44:18.882 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY'RE GONNA

02:44:18.015 --> 02:44:20.384 region:rollup2
PROVE OUT THERE CONCEPTS IN

02:44:18.882 --> 02:44:22.486 region:rollup2
FLORIDA. AUGUST ONCE THEY PROVE

02:44:20.384 --> 02:44:23.787 region:rollup2
THEIR CONCEPTS THEY ALL THEIR

02:44:22.486 --> 02:44:25.522 region:rollup2
BUSINESS MODELS SAY. THE

02:44:23.787 --> 02:44:27.291 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA COME ONCE WE

02:44:25.522 --> 02:44:28.759 region:rollup2
START LAUNCHING SUCCESSFULLY.

02:44:27.291 --> 02:44:30.060 region:rollup2
RUN HAVE TONS OF CUSTOMERS AND

02:44:28.759 --> 02:44:31.862 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD YOU

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:32.896 region:rollup2
EXTRA INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER

02:44:31.862 --> 02:44:34.298 region:rollup2
PLACES.

02:44:32.896 --> 02:44:35.632 region:rollup2
PASSOVER SO RIGHT NOW I AM

02:44:34.298 --> 02:44:37.167 region:rollup2
UNITS.

02:44:35.632 --> 02:44:38.769 region:rollup2
IT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THESE

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:40.771 region:rollup2
COMPANIES AND INCLUDING ROCKET

02:44:38.769 --> 02:44:41.939 region:rollup2
LAB WOULD LOVE TO GET A LAUNCH

02:44:40.771 --> 02:44:43.574 region:rollup2
FROM CALIFORNIA.

02:44:41.939 --> 02:44:45.809 region:rollup2
BUT THEY JUST FELT IT WAS

02:44:43.574 --> 02:44:46.677 region:rollup2
EASIER TO GO ELSEWHERE AND

02:44:45.809 --> 02:44:50.447 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY THEY DECIDE TO BUILD

02:44:46.677 --> 02:44:51.849 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN OVERSEE SPACEPORT.

02:44:50.447 --> 02:44:53.016 region:rollup2
MMHM. DOT THE EIGHT ALSO BRINGS

02:44:51.849 --> 02:44:54.418 region:rollup2
UP CHALLENGES WHEN THESE

02:44:53.016 --> 02:44:55.953 region:rollup2
SO THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING

02:44:54.418 --> 02:44:56.787 region:rollup2
AFTER THE SMALL SET MARKET.

02:44:55.953 --> 02:44:58.722 region:rollup2
WHICH NOW THE GOVERNMENT'S

02:44:56.787 --> 02:44:58.956 region:rollup2
GETTING INTERESTED.

02:44:58.722 --> 02:45:00.691 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:44:58.956 --> 02:45:02.059 region:rollup2
IT.

02:45:00.691 --> 02:45:04.528 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NATIONAL

02:45:02.059 --> 02:45:06.263 region:rollup2
SECURITY SMALL SAD SINCE AND

02:45:04.528 --> 02:45:08.265 region:rollup2
CLASSIFY PAYLOADS.

02:45:06.263 --> 02:45:10.768 region:rollup2
IT IT BECOMES MUCH MORE

02:45:08.265 --> 02:45:12.136 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING TO SHIP THE PAYLOAD

02:45:10.768 --> 02:45:13.036 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF AYE TO OUR CONCERNS

02:45:12.136 --> 02:45:15.472 region:rollup2
OR.

02:45:13.036 --> 02:45:17.107 region:rollup2
OVER TO NW ZEALAND FOR A

02:45:15.472 --> 02:45:17.674 region:rollup2
LAUNCH OR EVEN UP TO ALASKA.

02:45:17.107 --> 02:45:18.776 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD THEY WOULD MUCH

02:45:17.674 --> 02:45:21.178 region:rollup2
RATHER KEEP IT.

02:45:18.776 --> 02:45:22.446 region:rollup2
LOCAL AND KEEP IT IN THE

02:45:21.178 --> 02:45:22.646 region:rollup2
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES

02:45:22.446 --> 02:45:24.114 region:rollup2
AND.

02:45:22.646 --> 02:45:25.616 region:rollup2
SO SO I I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:45:24.114 --> 02:45:26.617 region:rollup2
OF INCENTIVES.

02:45:25.616 --> 02:45:27.918 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:45:26.617 --> 02:45:29.520 region:rollup2
FOR EVENTUALLY FOR THESE

COMPANIES TO BE HERE CALIFORNIA

02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:31.889 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT FOR

THAT'S SPACEX'S BUILDING.

02:45:40.731 --> 02:45:47.438 region:rollup2
THE LAUNCH PAD IN TEXAS.

02:45:44.535 --> 02:45:48.639 region:rollup2
HIS IS. MAN I CAN ASK THEM AND

02:45:47.438 --> 02:45:51.108 region:rollup2

FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE.

02:45:52.810 --> 02:45:55.379 region:rollup2
IS IT IS THAT.

02:45:53.777 --> 02:45:57.014 region:rollup2
AN INDICATION THAT PERHAPS SOME.

02:45:55.379 --> 02:45:57.281 region:rollup2
.

02:45:57.014 --> 02:45:59.082 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

02:45:57.281 --> 02:46:00.784 region:rollup2
.

02:45:59.082 --> 02:46:01.819 region:rollup2
SPACEX MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE

02:46:00.784 --> 02:46:06.023 region:rollup2
COULD BE FOLLOWING THE LAUNCH

02:46:01.819 --> 02:46:10.461 region:rollup2
PAD TO TEXAS.

02:46:06.023 --> 02:46:13.430 region:rollup2
WELL I I PLEDGE.

02:46:10.461 --> 02:46:16.834 region:rollup2
MAY LIE PROMESAS.

02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:18.735 region:rollup2
WHITE AND BUT I THINK YOU KNOW.

02:46:16.834 --> 02:46:21.638 region:rollup2
THE THE LOCATION OF THE LAUNCH

02:46:18.735 --> 02:46:23.507 region:rollup2
PAD OFTEN DEPENDS ON WHERE THE

02:46:21.638 --> 02:46:25.108 region:rollup2
LAUNCH IS GOING SO WE LAUNCH OUT

02:46:23.507 --> 02:46:26.677 region:rollup2
OF CAPE CANAVERAL AND. WERE

02:46:25.108 --> 02:46:28.579 region:rollup2
SENDING AYE.

02:46:26.677 --> 02:46:30.214 region:rollup2
ARE CARGO DRAGON CURRENTLY AND

02:46:28.579 --> 02:46:30.781 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY CREW DRAG INTO

02:46:30.214 --> 02:46:32.416 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

02:46:30.781 --> 02:46:33.417 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH

02:46:32.416 --> 02:46:34.952 region:rollup2
THE TRAJECTORY OF WHERE THE

02:46:33.417 --> 02:46:36.753 region:rollup2
LAUNCH IS GOING.

02:46:34.952 --> 02:46:38.021 region:rollup2
R. HOFFMAN FACILITY WE'RE NOW

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:38.789 region:rollup2
UP TO A MILLION AND A HALF

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:41.158 region:rollup2
SQUARE FEET.

02:46:38.789 --> 02:46:42.326 region:rollup2
AS OUR CAMPUS FOR OUR DESIGN

02:46:41.158 --> 02:46:43.594 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION MANUFACTURING SO

02:46:42.326 --> 02:46:44.928 region:rollup2
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT

02:46:43.594 --> 02:46:46.463 region:rollup2
TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT

02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:48.432 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT. I AM I THINK

02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:51.201 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE EAGER TO PICK UP

02:46:48.432 --> 02:46:51.835 region:rollup2
AND MOVE BUT YES THERE THEY ARE

02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:53.937 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:55.873 region:rollup2
HOPE AN ADDITIONAL LAUNCH

02:46:53.937 --> 02:46:57.441 region:rollup2
FACILITY IN TEXAS. AND ALL OF

02:46:55.873 --> 02:46:58.876 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT BEING

02:46:57.441 --> 02:47:00.410 region:rollup2
FURTHER SOUTH EVEN ON THE CAPE

02:46:58.876 --> 02:47:01.778 region:rollup2
SO IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH

02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:04.281 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LAUNCHERS ARE GOING.

02:47:01.778 --> 02:47:05.916 region:rollup2
AND. AND WE WE ARE RAMPING UP

02:47:04.281 --> 02:47:07.217 region:rollup2
OUR LAUNCH KIDS GOING OUT OF

02:47:05.916 --> 02:47:08.986 region:rollup2
VANDENBERG SO THERE'S STILL A

02:47:07.217 --> 02:47:09.520 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT TO HEAR

02:47:08.986 --> 02:47:13.156 region:rollup2
TO CALIFORNIA HANDS AND WE

02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:13.957 region:rollup2
DON'T.

02:47:13.156 --> 02:47:15.792 region:rollup2
OR SEE THAT CHANGING BUT IN

02:47:13.957 --> 02:47:17.928 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE THE THE LAUNCH IS

02:47:15.792 --> 02:47:19.930 region:rollup2
SET TO BE TAKING PLACE IN TEXAS.

02:47:17.928 --> 02:47:22.199 region:rollup2
AS OF NOW THE THE MANUFACTURING

02:47:19.930 --> 02:47:23.901 region:rollup2
TAKES PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:47:22.199 --> 02:47:25.269 region:rollup2
THEN THOSE. ROCKET SHIP YES

02:47:23.901 --> 02:47:27.070 region:rollup2
THOUGH ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR

02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:29.339 region:rollup2
ROCKETS ARE MANUFACTURED HERE IN

02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:31.141 region:rollup2
OUR HAWTHORNE FACILITY. AND

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:32.042 region:rollup2
THERE IS. WHEAT YOU HEARD FROM

02:47:31.141 --> 02:47:33.110 region:rollup2
OTHER PANELISTS THAT THEY DO

02:47:32.042 --> 02:47:35.145 region:rollup2
ENGINE TESTING AT DIFFERENT

02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:35.379 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS WE DO OUR TESTING AND

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:37.114 region:rollup2
TEXAS.

02:47:35.379 --> 02:47:39.249 region:rollup2
.

02:47:37.114 --> 02:47:40.951 region:rollup2
BUT OUR MANUFACTURING IS HERE IN

02:47:39.249 --> 02:47:42.986 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN IMAGINE

02:47:40.951 --> 02:47:44.488 region:rollup2
THAT TESTING ROCKET ENGINES AND

02:47:42.986 --> 02:47:46.623 region:rollup2
URBAN LOS ANGELES WOULD NOT BE

02:47:44.488 --> 02:47:48.492 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE. AND WHICH IS WHY ARE

02:47:46.623 --> 02:47:49.893 region:rollup2
TESTING FOR THE ENGINE FIRING

02:47:48.492 --> 02:47:51.995 region:rollup2
AND DOESN'T HAPPEN AT OUR

02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:54.631 region:rollup2

YOU.

02:48:17.988 --> 02:48:20.657 region:rollup2
POST A QUESTION WHY ARE THESE

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:22.426 region:rollup2
WIRE SOME COMPANIES LAUNCHING

02:48:20.657 --> 02:48:24.528 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA HE TALKED

02:48:22.426 --> 02:48:25.829 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SPACE WORSE SPACEPORT

02:48:24.528 --> 02:48:27.531 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:48:25.829 --> 02:48:29.166 region:rollup2
THE REGULATORY HURDLES.

02:48:27.531 --> 02:48:32.402 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH YOU INITIALLY START

02:48:29.166 --> 02:48:34.471 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

02:48:32.402 --> 02:48:36.673 region:rollup2
THAT. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF

02:48:34.471 --> 02:48:37.307 region:rollup2
COMPLYING WITH REGULATIONS FROM

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:37.574 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT JUST

02:48:37.307 --> 02:48:39.376 region:rollup2
A STATE.

02:48:37.574 --> 02:48:41.144 region:rollup2
AROUND.

02:48:39.376 --> 02:48:43.113 region:rollup2
.

02:48:41.144 --> 02:48:44.748 region:rollup2
ARE YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS

02:48:43.113 --> 02:48:46.383 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR STREAMLINING

02:48:44.748 --> 02:48:47.985 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS THOSE ARE PRIMARILY.

02:48:46.383 --> 02:48:49.853 region:rollup2
IN THE AREA OF THE

02:48:47.985 --> 02:48:51.421 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

02:48:49.853 --> 02:48:53.290 region:rollup2
YES SIR SO ENVIRONMENTAL.

02:48:51.421 --> 02:48:54.992 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS.

02:48:53.290 --> 02:48:56.526 region:rollup2
JUST IN GENERAL SAFETY

02:48:54.992 --> 02:48:58.395 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS WHICH IS BOTH

02:48:56.526 --> 02:49:01.131 region:rollup2
IT'S BOTH CAL OSHA AS WELL AS.

02:48:58.395 --> 02:49:02.499 region:rollup2
AT AS.

02:49:01.131 --> 02:49:04.735 region:rollup2
AT VANDERBURGH BEING ON THE

02:49:02.499 --> 02:49:06.737 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PROPERTY SO WE DO WHAT'S

02:49:04.735 --> 02:49:07.504 region:rollup2
WITH FEDERAL SAFETY AND DIED

02:49:06.737 --> 02:49:10.240 region:rollup2
VANDERBURGH SAFETY AS WELL.

02:49:07.504 --> 02:49:12.309 region:rollup2
.

02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:14.311 region:rollup2
THAT DAY.

02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:15.379 region:rollup2
WHILE A LOT OF TIMES THOSE THOSE

02:49:14.311 --> 02:49:17.614 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REGULATIONS WHETHER

02:49:15.379 --> 02:49:19.383 region:rollup2
IT'S CALIFORNIA OR FEDERAL.

02:49:17.614 --> 02:49:20.751 region:rollup2
THEIR CONFLICTING.

02:49:19.383 --> 02:49:22.586 region:rollup2
SO IF A COMPANY IS.

02:49:20.751 --> 02:49:24.221 region:rollup2
.

02:49:22.586 --> 02:49:27.290 region:rollup2
DURING THEIR FIRST LAUNCHES IN

02:49:24.221 --> 02:49:27.557 region:rollup2
IN ALASKA WHERE THEY'RE A LITTLE

02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:29.860 region:rollup2
BIT MORE.

02:49:27.557 --> 02:49:31.128 region:rollup2
.

02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:32.896 region:rollup2
LENIENT ON SOME OF THOSE

02:49:31.128 --> 02:49:34.331 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS THAT WHEN THEY COME

02:49:32.896 --> 02:49:35.499 region:rollup2
TO TRANSPORT THEIR OPERATIONS TO

02:49:34.331 --> 02:49:37.467 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IF IT BRINGS ON

02:49:35.499 --> 02:49:40.270 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COSTS.

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:41.972 region:rollup2
IT AS AT THE FAA MENTIONED YOUR

02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:43.507 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME THEY WANT. ANYONE OF

02:49:41.972 --> 02:49:45.976 region:rollup2
THESE COMPANIES WANTS TO LAUNCH

02:49:43.507 --> 02:49:47.344 region:rollup2
THAT. I GET SAME EXACT ROCKET

02:49:45.976 --> 02:49:48.812 region:rollup2
FROM A DIFFERENT SPACE PORT IT

02:49:47.344 --> 02:49:51.248 region:rollup2
IT GOES THROUGH A WHOLE NEW

02:49:48.812 --> 02:49:52.983 region:rollup2
LICENSING PROCESS HER SPACEPORT

02:49:51.248 --> 02:49:54.117 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S SPECIFIC TO

02:49:52.983 --> 02:49:56.787 region:rollup2
THE LOCATION.

02:49:54.117 --> 02:49:58.388 region:rollup2
AND SO HOT SO NOT ONLY DO THEY

02:49:56.787 --> 02:49:58.855 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WITH THE

02:49:58.388 --> 02:50:00.757 region:rollup2
FAA WHEN THEY COME TO

02:49:58.855 --> 02:50:02.025 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:50:00.757 --> 02:50:03.427 region:rollup2
BUT THEN THEY ALSO HAVE TO GO

02:50:02.025 --> 02:50:05.996 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT PROCESS WITH THE

02:50:03.427 --> 02:50:07.230 region:rollup2
FEDERAL RANGE AND AND FLYING ON

02:50:05.996 --> 02:50:09.166 region:rollup2
THE RANGE AND ALL THE RANGE

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:10.834 region:rollup2
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT

02:50:09.166 --> 02:50:14.638 region:rollup2
THEY LEVY ON THEM. OKAY.

02:50:10.834 --> 02:50:16.707 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD BE ON ONE OF THE.

02:50:14.638 --> 02:50:17.774 region:rollup2
PERHAPS AREAS THAT SHOULD WE

02:50:16.707 --> 02:50:18.975 region:rollup2
SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING THE

TO FLY FROM.

02:53:17.754 --> 02:53:20.323 region:rollup2

FLIGHTS WILL HAPPEN ALSO FROM A

02:53:20.323 --> 02:53:23.326 region:rollup2
HOBBY AT IT'S A FANTASTIC

MANY PERHAPS ALL OF OUR PORT

02:53:36.106 --> 02:53:39.643 region:rollup2
POLAR FLIGHTS WILL CONTINUE TO

HAPPEN FROM THERE. AND POLAR

02:53:39.643 --> 02:53:43.046 region:rollup2
LAUNCHES OUR A FAIRLY LARGE

02:53:41.378 --> 02:53:44.481 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF OF OF THAT TERM

02:53:43.046 --> 02:53:46.116 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL MET DEMAND THAT WE'VE

02:53:44.481 --> 02:53:47.584 region:rollup2
SEEN THUS FAR.

02:53:46.116 --> 02:53:49.052 region:rollup2
FOUR SATELLITES I WANT TO GO TO

02:53:47.584 --> 02:53:50.553 region:rollup2
OTHER ORBITAL DESTINATIONS THAT

02:53:49.052 --> 02:53:51.187 region:rollup2
MAYBE ONE OF YOUR BRING AROUND

02:53:50.553 --> 02:53:53.256 region:rollup2
THE EQUATOR RATHER THAN AROUND

02:53:51.187 --> 02:53:54.591 region:rollup2
THE POLES. OUT BOTH THE LAWS OF

02:53:53.256 --> 02:53:55.792 region:rollup2
NATURE AND THE LAWS OF HUMANS

02:53:54.591 --> 02:53:56.993 region:rollup2
INDICATE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:53:55.792 --> 02:53:57.927 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR

02:53:56.993 --> 02:53:58.762 region:rollup2
THAT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO

02:53:57.927 --> 02:54:00.297 region:rollup2
LAUNCH FROM SOMEWHERE THAT'S A

02:53:58.762 --> 02:54:02.032 region:rollup2
MUCH LOWER LATITUDE. AND SO

02:54:00.297 --> 02:54:03.433 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY PLACES FOR OTHER

02:54:02.032 --> 02:54:05.468 region:rollup2
SPACE COMPANIES AND FOR USAS

02:54:03.433 --> 02:54:07.470 region:rollup2

THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:54:08.371 --> 02:54:10.540 region:rollup2
PACIFIC.

02:54:09.205 --> 02:54:11.841 region:rollup2
HAVE STARTED TO BE MORE

PLACES BUT I ANTICIPATE THAT

02:54:15.412 --> 02:54:17.647 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WILL ALWAYS BE AN

02:54:16.513 --> 02:54:19.382 region:rollup2

WE DIDN'T MAKE A GOOD POINT OF

02:54:33.163 --> 02:54:35.932 region:rollup2
THAT THE REASON WHY WE'RE

02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:38.501 region:rollup2

SMALL SETS AND.

03:00:05.294 --> 03:00:08.298 region:rollup2
