MISTER MCCARTY PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU GOOD TO BE BACK HAPPY NEW YEAR AFTER YEAR COMMITTEE. HOT FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK OUR COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH US OVER THE BREAK TO GET THIS BILL IN ORDER TO BE HEARD TODAY AND. WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS PRESENTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THIS THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY HELPS TO IMPROVE. SCREENINGS FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF ZERO THREE THREE. HELPING THEM GET ARE ON TRACK TO HAVE PROPER DEVELOPMENTS IN LIFE AND IN SCHOOL. HOW WE KNOW THAT? EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS SO CRITICAL IN THE EARLY FIRST THREE YEARS OF LIFE. CAUSING THE BRAIN ARCHITECTURE TO DEVELOP IT CONVERSELY WHEN CHALLENGES. COME AROUND IT IT IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT EARLY IN INTERVENTION IS KEY. AND. SCREENINGS CAN IDENTIFY THESE ISSUES EARLY ON AND FOCUSING ON. IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE CHILD'S IT IMPACT IN HEALTH AND SCHOOL IN IN THE LATER YEARS. WE KNOW THAT. ADVERSE HOW THE CHILD IMPACTS CREATES TOXIC STRESS WHICH HAS HORRIBLE LONG TERM IMPACTS ON THE THE YOUNG CHILD IN LIFE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT REMEDIES CAN'T COME ABOUT BY REGAINING HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES TODAY. AND THAT THISWOULD ALLOW SCREENINGS AT THE EARLIER LEVELS OF A CHILD'S EXISTENCE AND BRING ABOUT BETTER OUTCOMES FOR KIDS. WITH THAT I HAVE DOCTOR MONEY PATEL FROM THE UCLA EXCUSE ME U. S. C.. BIG. BIG PROBLEM. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AND A BIG MISTAKE BESSER OF PEDIATRICS DOCTOR PATEL. GOOD HAVE AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO COME AND ADDRESS YOU TODAY I AM DOCTOR MANTAPA TOWN I COME TO YOU AS A PEDIATRICIAN WHO CARES FOR. IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES OF LOS ANGELES FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS. I MEAN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL PEDIATRICS WITH THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES. AND THE CO CHAIR OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COUNCIL FOR THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. EIGHT CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF OUR PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOME FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS AND I WOULD SAY MOST IMPORTANT I AM THE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN WHO. I'VE WATCHED GROW AND DEVELOP. MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE EPIDEMIC OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY STARTING WHEN I BEGAN PRACTICING IN BOYLE HEIGHTS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. I NOTED INCREASED INCIDENCE OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY PREDOMINANTLY SPEECH DELAY IN THIS COMMUNITY. COULDN'T AND I NOTICED THAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT I WORKED ALONGSIDE WE'RE NOT DOING THE EVIDENCE BASED SCREENING THAT WE HAVE ALL TIED BEEN TIED TO DELAYS PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS. SPECIFICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I REMEMBER WALKING INTO A ROOM AND THE CHART ON THE DOOR SAID NINE MONTH WELL CHILD VISIT. WHEN I WALKED IN THE ROOM I SAW MOM HOLDING UP HER CHILD PROPPING HER UP IN A CITY POSITION AND HOLDING HER HEAD. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD NINE MONTH WITH CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT AT THIS AGE THEY SHOULD BE SITTING THEY SHOULD BE STARTING TO FEED THEMSELVES. THEY SHOULD START CRAWLING PULLING THEMSELVES UP TO STAND IN THIS TOWN UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT ABLE TO DO SO. I SAT NEXT TO MOM AND I ASK YOU A BROADER IN THAT DAY AND SHE SAID SHE IS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE SHE VISITED MANY DOCTORS AND THEY ALL THE DOCTORS TOLD HER CHILDLESS FINE. AND SHE SAID AS A MOTHER SHE KNEW THAT HER CHILD WAS NOT DEVELOPING THE SAME AS HER OTHER CHILDREN. pAND SHE WANTED HELP. I FINISH MY ASSESSMENT AND I DID A VALIDATED SCREENING TOOL CALLED THE AGES AND STAGES AND I CONFIRM THAT HER CHILD DID IN FACT HAVE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY IN A WORKED WITH AND HER WITH HER FOR THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. INTEGRATING HER INTO COMEY BT COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCE SAYS FOR EARLY INTERVENTION WHICH ALREADY EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY. I'M I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO ON OCTOBER RIGHT AT HER FIVE YEAR OLD WELL CHILD VISIT. IN MY P. SHIP RAN INTO THE ROOM SHE TOLD ME THE COLOR OF HER PARENTS HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT HER KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AT ROWING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DOWN THE STREET. SHE'S MAINSTREAMED AND GRADUATED FROM THERAPIES AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TAKE THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE HAVE WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS CHILD GETTER INTO EARLY INTERVENTION RESOURCES AND WE HAVE CHANGED HER LIFE NOW SHE'S MAINSTREAM AND THERE'S IN THE SHE DOES NOT HAVE A NEED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION RESOURCES. THE PREVALENCE OF JOAN OF THE LEÃ³N CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE HAS INCREASED BY SEVENTEEN POINT ONE PERCENT IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS. WITH UP TO FIFTEEN PERCENT TWELVE MILE DELAY IN IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES THE SAME COMMITTEES THAT I SERVE. THEIR REASONS IS JUSTICE ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY MENTIONED INFLUENCES OF TOXIC STRESS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. MICHAEL CYCLE SOCIAL SOUGHT STIMULATION FOR CHILDREN. IN REALLY OVERWHELMINGLY FEWER RESOURCES THAT EXIST IN THESE COMMUNITIES. WE NOT THAT WHAT THE LATINO POPULATION THERE'S AN EVEN GREATER. CHANCE OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY UP TO THREE TIMES OTHER CHILDREN. IN OUR STATE UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PEDIATRICS MANDATING THROUGH RIGHT FEATURES THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING EVIDENCE BASE SCREENINGS WITH VALIDATED MEASURES THAT NINE MONTHS EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY MONTHS. AND WITH DHS MANDATING WITH CA SHEEPY GUIDELINES WE SHOULD BE DOING THESE. I PERSONALLY LESSEN A THIRD OF CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY SCREENED AND OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW OUR STATE RANKS FORTY THIRD IN THE NATION FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AND WE CAN DO BETTER. THAT. THE REASON WHY THIS EARLY IDENTIFICATION IS SO IMPORTANT IS AS WAS MENTIONED BETWEEN THE AGES OF ZERO THREE. THAT'S THE PRIME TIME THAT THE CHILD'S BRAIN IS THE MOST PLASTIC WE CALL IT KNOW PLASTICITY WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE YOU CAN STIMULATE. YOU CAN GROW YOU CAN IMPACT A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT AND BY THAT YOU CAN IMPACT AND OPTIMIZE THEIR FUTURE. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WAS HONORED TO GET AT LARGE SCALE GRANT TO STANDARDIZE OPERATIONALIZE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING IN MY CLINIC SYSTEMS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY AFTER THREE YEARS. WE'VE GONE FROM A SCREENING RATE OF TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO NINETY SIX PERCENT. WE HAVE SCREENED EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN IN EAST LOS ANGELES WE KNOW THAT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS A SCREEN THAT DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY RISKS IS BY TWELVE POINT NINE PERCENT. OF SEVERE TEN TWENTY PERCENT DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE HAVE CONNECTED FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR CHILDREN INTO EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. SO THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE HERE I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THESE RESOURCES ALREADY EXIST WE ARE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS AND WE SHOULD BE ALLOCATING FUNDING AND WHATEVER WE CAN DO TOGETHER TO OPTIMIZE. THE FUTURE FOR THESE CHILDREN STILL THINK YOU. I AM HAVING A LITTLE DONNA AND I AM REPRESENTING FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATION NEWS ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS UP THIS BILL AND I AM JUST APPEAR ONE FOR MORAL SUPPORT AND TO. JUST ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF THEY DO END UP GETTING DIRECTED TOWARDS ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER SINCE SUPPORT. BUT I HAVE A MINUTE.

ALEX TO CAPRI ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. PRETTY MUCH ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DETERMINE. CLAIMS THE CHAIR THEY DO WE OFTEN TO THE WITNESSES JUST ONE QUESTION. ABOUT WHAT A BARRIER SO MAKING THE SCREENING HAPPEN. WE HAVE A NUMBER PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO THIS LIKE EARLY STAR PROGRAM. WITHIN. THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TO DO THIS TYPE OF SCREENING. WHAT BARRIERS EXIST AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT ONCE THIS LEGISLATION PASSES? THAT THOSE WHO NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS READINGS IN FACT. DO GET. FIVE POINT WE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE LAST YEAR LOOKING AT THE SAME THING AS WHAT AT THE VARIATION CHALLENGES TO DEVELOP ALL SCREENING. AND THE REASONS AT LEAST FROM THE PROVIDER AND IS TIME CONSTRAINTS I'M WE WORK IN BUSY A LOT OF US IN COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTERS FQHCS WE HAVE TWENTY MINUTE APPOINTMENTS. AND IN THOSE TWENTY MIN APPOINTMENTS WE HAVE TO DEAL OVERWHELMING ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE AND WELL CHILD CARE. KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCREENING TOOLS REMEMBER CHILDREN ARE NOT SEEN BY ONLY PEDIATRICIANS BUT MID LEVEL PROVIDERS FAMILY PRACTICE EVEN ADULT PROVIDERS AND A LOT OF TIMES. IT DEPENDING ON YOUR RESIDENTS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL EDUCATION YOU MAY NOT HAVE YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT THE VALIDATED SCREENING TOOLS. AND THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION IN THE COMMUNITY THAT DIVERT MENTAL SURVEILLANCE EQUALS DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING SURVEILLANCE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CHILD TWO MONTHS THEY SHOULD BE SMILE THEY SHOULD BE GOING. THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS ACTUALLY DOING A FORMALIZED DEVELOPMENTAL SCREEN. AND AND MOST PROVIDERS ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS THAT DIFFERENCE. THERE'S ALSO RELIANCE ON FAMILIES TO REPORT PROBLEMS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY IN ARE PREDOMINATELY TINO POPULATION WE FOUND THAT. A LOT OF THE FAMILIES DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS NORMAL DEVELOPMENT AND THAT RECOGNITION ISN'T THERE AND THERE MAY BE A PROVIDER RELIANCE ON FAMILIES JUST TELL. THEM WHAT IS HAPPENING AND THEN FINALLY. WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO EVEN SCREEN THERE'S ALSO WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU HAVE A POSITIVE LIGHT OF THE PROVIDERS DON'T KNOW THE SYSTEMS OF CARE AND THE CHALLENGES AND UNDERSTAND. THIS REGIONAL CENTER THERE'S COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN HELP SO IT'S A VERY COMPLEX MULTI FACTOR. SURE YOU IN THE AUTHOR GONNA HELP US TO GET THROUGH THOSE BARRIERS SO THANK YOU THINK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WENDY. YEAH. IT HAS MOVED IN WITH BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SEASON MISS KOREA SORRY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION AS THE TELL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST JUMP IN. IT'S KIND OF SHOCKING THAT WERE FORTY THIRD. IN THE NATION ON DOING THIS THIS TYPE OF. PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS A MOM.
