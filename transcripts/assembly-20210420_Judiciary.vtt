00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.584
SO DID YOU TOUCH ON THINGS THEM

00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:55.552
UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION CRACK

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:57.520
ONE IS IMPORTANT. ONE IS THE

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:59.589
QUESTION OF. HOW WORKING. AND

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:04.828
GENERATE. I THINK. SO THE

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:06.830
ENFORCEMENT PERSONALLY YES- SO

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:08.898
I MEAN REQUIRE. YOU KNOW IT'S

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:09.799
THE IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED HAVE

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:10.600
THE ATTORNEY JOHN AS THE

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:13.570
ENFORCER OF. AND THE I BELIEVE

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:14.437
THE MOST IN. MECHANISM THERE IS

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:15.572
AN ENGINE I THINK WE ALL. TO

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:16.806
THIS TO BE CORRECTED RIGHT NEAR

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.274
DRUGS OR IT COULD CRACK THAT'S

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:20.577
THE GOAL. AND SO WHAT HAS BEEN

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:21.644
A PROBLEM IN THE PAST IS THIS

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:24.514
QUESTION OF WILL THERE BE GIVEN

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:25.482
HOW COMPLICATED THIS IS BECAUSE

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:27.617
I THINK HOPE HI I PERSONALLY

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:29.486
BELIEVE THAT IF SOMETHING IS.

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:30.787
MORE EXPENSIVE TO MANUFACTURE

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:32.122
WHICH IN SOME CASES WOMEN'S

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.523
GARMENTS FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.391
MORE EXPENSIVE TO TAYLOR THEN

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:36.693
EMAIL GARMENT THAT YOU CAN

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.727
CHARGE FOR THAT RIGHT FOR THE

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:38.895
COST OF THE DIFFERENTIAL IN

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:40.230
PRODUCTION OF GOODS. AND SO

00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:41.631
THIS IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:42.966
OF WHERE IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:44.134
PRICE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.602
COSTS MORE TO MANUFACTURE THE

00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:47.003
GOOD AND WHERE IS IT JUST. A

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.340
GENDER TAX RATE. AND SO THAT.

00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:50.974
GIVE THE COMPLICATED NATURE OF

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.776
THAT. YOU KNOW THIS ITERATION

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:53.877
OF THE BILL SAYS THAT WE

00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:55.311
BELIEVE THAT THE ENFORCEMENT IS

00:56:55.378 --> 00:56:56.346
APPROPRIATELY PLACED IN THE

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:58.014
HANDS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL-

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.549
IT IS WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:00.850
WE ARE THINKING ABOUT IS DO WE

00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:02.218
WANT IT. GIVEN HOW MUCH THE

00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:03.186
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:04.754
OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO. WE

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:05.989
WANT TO EXPAND THAT OUT TO

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:07.157
LOCAL CITY ATTORNEYS TO GIVE

00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:08.091
LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE RIGHT TO

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:09.058
DO THIS YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:10.527
BAND WITH TO DO THAT SO THAT IS

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:11.361
ON THE TABLE AND IF THAT'S

00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:13.163
SOMETHING. THAT I WOULD SUGGEST

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.497
ADDING THAT BEFORE IT GETS TO

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:15.632
APPROACH IT'S FEELING A LITTLE

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:18.268
BIT LIGHT- STATEMENT BILL WHICH

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.903
I'M COOL WITH BUT IT'S NOT

PEOPLE WITH THE KIND OF RELIEF.

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:24.440
THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY I DON'T

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:25.608
SEE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:26.910

ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT DOWN

WE CAN MAKE THIS MORE WORKABLE

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.275
I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS LOW

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:55.076
HANGING FRUIT AND SOME OF THE-

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:56.444
THE CLAIMS THAT WERE MADE JUST

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:57.345
AREN'T BORNE OUT BY WHAT'S

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.146
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THE

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:00.148
MARKETPLACE- TELEVISIONS AND

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.983
OTHER BREAKABLE- ELECTRONICS

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.385
WERE BROUGHT UP. SAM SONG NO

POLYSTYRENE THEIR PACKAGING

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:07.122
THEY USED TO FOR A KIND OF

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.924
FOAM- MOLDED- CARDBOARD FOR

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.059
THEIR TELEVISIONS AND THEIR

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.927
BREAKABLE ELECTRONICS- SO THE

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.062
INDUSTRY IS ALREADY MOVING IN

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:15.330
THIS DIRECTION THEY'RE SHOWING

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:16.898
NOT IN THE FUTURE BUT RIGHT NOW

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.233
EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THIS IS

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.601
POSSIBLE EVEN FOR VERY

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.136
BREAKABLE OBJECTS. WE HAVE

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:22.304
LIMITED THIS TO LARGE ONLINE

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.172
RETAILERS I THINK IT MAYBE IS

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.173
TELLING THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.008
ONLINE RETAILERS HAS NOT YET-

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.443
COME IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:29.277
ARE ALREADY MOVING IN THIS

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:31.079
DIRECTION VERY RAPIDLY AND KNOW

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:32.647
THAT THIS IS WHAT THEIR

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:34.316
CUSTOMERS ARE ARE LOOKING FOR.

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:35.684
A WAY TO THE WERE THE TALK

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:36.618
ABOUT US INVESTING IN

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:37.819
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RECYCLING

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:38.687
AND I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.388
NUMBER ONE IT SHOULDN'T BE ON

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:41.690
PUBLIC AGENCIES AND CONSUMERS

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:43.191
AND RATEPAYERS TO PAID UP ALL

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.693
THE BURDEN OF THIS AND IT EVERY

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:46.094
TIME IS LEGISLATURE IS TRIED TO

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:47.329
HAVE MORE PRODUCER

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:48.697
RESPONSIBILITY AND SHIPPER

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:50.131
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRASH

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.599
THAT THEY ARE LITERALLY DUMPING

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.401
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:55.337
THEY THEY DON'T SUPPORT THOSE

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:59.374
EFFORTS AND. THOSE BILLS VERY

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:00.442
RARELY MAKE IT THROUGH. AND

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.110
THIS MAN. IS NOT RECYCLABLE

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:03.778
THERE IS NO MARKET FOR IT IT'S

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.080
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO TRY TO

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.381
RECYCLE IT OVER AND OVER AND I

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:07.282
DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT CAN BE

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:08.983
RATE RECYCLED MORE THAN ONCE.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.218
THE AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.087
IT IS A DANGEROUS PRODUCT IT'S

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:13.088
A DANGEROUS PRODUCT IN OUR

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.856
ENVIRONMENT. IT BREAKS DOWN

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:16.458
INTO MICROPLASTICS IT END UP

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:17.992
EVEN WHEN IT'S AN LANDFILLS IN

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.494
OUR WATER STREAMS THAT NOW IS

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.563
DETECTABLE AT. PRETTY HIGH

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:23.098

BORN BABIES. THAT'S

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.370
UNACCEPTABLE AND IN THIS CASE

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:30.505

THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY- RIGHT

03:11:00.582 --> 03:11:02.217
ACT AND THAT PROVIDES UP TO

03:11:02.284 --> 03:11:03.518
THREE MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

03:11:03.585 --> 03:11:05.353
CARE FOR MEDICAL CARE WHICH IS

03:11:05.420 --> 03:11:06.788
FANTASTIC IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE

03:11:06.855 --> 03:11:08.223
ALWAYS NEEDED. I GUESS MY

03:11:08.290 --> 03:11:10.125
CONCERN IS AS A SMALL BUSINESS

03:11:10.192 --> 03:11:12.594
OWNER THE POTENTIAL OF-

03:11:12.661 --> 03:11:14.062
LITIGATION BEING PUT ON A SMALL

03:11:14.129 --> 03:11:15.197
BUSINESSES THERE'S BAD ACTORS

03:11:15.263 --> 03:11:17.365
AND THERE'S GOOD ACTORS- BUT WE

03:11:17.432 --> 03:11:18.333
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE SMALL

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:20.001
BUSINESSES EMPLOY THESE PEOPLE

03:11:20.068 --> 03:11:21.970
AND SO IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

03:11:22.037 --> 03:11:24.039
BE THERE ARE. THE JOBS LEAVE SO

03:11:24.105 --> 03:11:25.307
WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN WHAT'S

03:11:25.373 --> 03:11:26.875
YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT ON THE

03:11:26.942 --> 03:11:28.109
LITIGATION THAT COULD COME UP

03:11:28.176 --> 03:11:29.110
THERE SPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T

03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:32.447
HAVE- A REASONABLE- YOU KNOW

03:11:32.514 --> 03:11:34.482
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS WHAT

03:11:34.549 --> 03:11:35.417
IS THE DEFINITION OF THAT

03:11:35.483 --> 03:11:36.885
THAT'S MY CHILDREN. THANK YOU

03:11:36.952 --> 03:11:37.886
THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU FOR

03:11:37.953 --> 03:11:39.588
THE QUESTION FOR **** SO MY

03:11:39.654 --> 03:11:40.889
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE FORTY

03:11:40.956 --> 03:11:42.757
HOURS A WEEK OF- DOES NOT APPLY

03:11:42.824 --> 03:11:44.092
TO BUSINESSES TWENTY FIVE

03:11:44.159 --> 03:11:46.461
EMPLOYEES OR OR BELOW SO I

03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:47.095
THINK WE'RE LEAVING OUT A WHOLE

03:11:47.162 --> 03:11:48.897
COHORT OF FOLKS THERE- WITH

03:11:48.964 --> 03:11:50.699
REGARD TO THE LYTIC LITIGATION-

03:11:50.765 --> 03:11:52.500
QUESTION. WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN

03:11:52.567 --> 03:11:53.568
IT IN THIS BILL THAT'S BEEN

03:11:53.635 --> 03:11:55.003
PASSED IN OVER TWO HUNDRED

03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.804
MINUTES OF HOLIDAYS ACROSS THE

03:11:55.871 --> 03:11:57.105
COUNTRY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A

03:11:57.172 --> 03:11:58.874
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN-

03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:00.141
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

03:12:00.208 --> 03:12:01.910
HASTINGS LAW DID SOME RESEARCH

03:12:01.977 --> 03:12:03.411
ON THIS AND- AND FOUND I THINK

03:12:03.478 --> 03:12:04.980
IN TOTAL THERE WERE SEVENTY ONE

03:12:05.046 --> 03:12:06.181
TOTAL LAWSUITS PERTAINING TO

03:12:06.248 --> 03:12:08.483
THIS SO. IT'S JUST NOT. AS

03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:09.384
PREVALENT I THINK IS THE

03:12:09.451 --> 03:12:10.685
CHAMBERS SAYING THAT IT WILL

03:12:10.752 --> 03:12:13.788
BE- I ALSO THINK THAT THIS BILL

03:12:13.855 --> 03:12:16.124
IS IT'S VERY NARROWLY DEFINED

03:12:16.191 --> 03:12:17.959
YOU KNOW IT'S- REQUIRES

03:12:18.026 --> 03:12:20.095
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR

03:12:20.161 --> 03:12:21.229
THE KNOWN FAMILY

03:12:21.296 --> 03:12:22.330
RESPONSIBILITIES AN APPLICANT

03:12:22.397 --> 03:12:23.632
OR EMPLOYEE RELATED TO

03:12:23.698 --> 03:12:25.300
OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM.

03:12:25.367 --> 03:12:26.868
NEEDING TO CARE FOR A MINOR

03:12:26.935 --> 03:12:28.203
CHILD OR CARE RECIPIENT WHO

03:12:28.270 --> 03:12:29.938
SCHOOL OR PLACE OF CARE IS

03:12:30.005 --> 03:12:31.439
CLOSED OR OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE

03:12:31.506 --> 03:12:33.742
SO IT'S NARROW IN SCOPE- AND

03:12:33.808 --> 03:12:34.609
THE LAST THING I'LL SAY WITH

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:36.578
THE FORTY HOURS YOU KNOW THAT

03:12:36.645 --> 03:12:37.712
CAN BE USED FOR A LOT OF

03:12:37.779 --> 03:12:39.180
DIFFERENT THINGS DOMESTIC

03:12:39.247 --> 03:12:43.919
VIOLENCE. STALKING I MEAN

03:12:43.985 --> 03:12:44.920
THERE'S A WIDE AGE OF THINGS AS

03:12:44.986 --> 03:12:45.453
A SHOULD BE. THIS IS VERY

03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:49.858
NARROW AND- THE STRANGER. THANK

03:12:49.925 --> 03:12:54.396
YOU MISTER CHAIR- I REALLY I

03:12:54.462 --> 03:12:56.097
THINK I UNDERSTAND PROBABLY

03:12:56.164 --> 03:12:57.766
BETTER THAN ANYONE THERE ARE

03:12:57.832 --> 03:12:59.534
BETTER THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE-

03:12:59.601 --> 03:13:01.469
SITTING UP HERE HOW IMPORTANT

03:13:01.536 --> 03:13:03.405
THIS IS I'VE BEEN A SINGLE DAD

03:13:03.471 --> 03:13:05.373
NOW FOR- FOURTEEN YEARS IN

03:13:05.440 --> 03:13:07.943
EFFECT AS THIS WAS GOING ON MY

03:13:08.009 --> 03:13:09.444
DAUGHTER AND I'VE BEEN TEXTING

03:13:09.511 --> 03:13:10.011
ABOUT A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT

03:13:10.078 --> 03:13:12.113
THAT WE NEED TO. COMPLETE AND

03:13:12.180 --> 03:13:13.648
IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY IT'S BEEN

03:13:13.715 --> 03:13:15.617
VERY DIFFICULT- AND NUMBER THE

03:13:15.684 --> 03:13:17.919
SITUATIONS AND THEN SOME THAT

03:13:17.986 --> 03:13:20.622
WERE BROUGHT UP HERE HAVE I'VE

03:13:20.689 --> 03:13:21.222
PERSONALLY EXPERIENED HOW HARD

03:13:21.289 --> 03:13:24.192
THIS IS TO DO- SO. I APPRECIATE

03:13:24.259 --> 03:13:26.394
THIS AND I AND I REALLY SEE AND

03:13:26.461 --> 03:13:28.229
UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THIS

03:13:28.296 --> 03:13:29.130
ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO

03:13:29.197 --> 03:13:30.932
TALK ABOUT THOUGH IS. A I DO

03:13:30.999 --> 03:13:32.567
THINK THAT THE- THERE NEEDS TO

03:13:32.634 --> 03:13:34.069
BE CERTAINTY. AND THE

03:13:34.135 --> 03:13:36.404
DEFINITIONS NEED TO BE TIGHTLY

03:13:36.471 --> 03:13:38.740
DEFINED FOR AN FOR. A NUMBER OF

03:13:38.807 --> 03:13:40.475
REASONS. WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW

03:13:40.542 --> 03:13:43.011
FAIRNESS TO SMALL BUSINESSES-

03:13:43.078 --> 03:13:44.980
BUT- BUT IN ADDITION IT'S

03:13:45.046 --> 03:13:46.848
AVOIDING LITIGATION YOU KNOW.

03:13:46.915 --> 03:13:48.516
FOR THE ACTORS OUT THERE AND I

03:13:48.583 --> 03:13:50.618
AM REALLY I DO. THINK YOU KNOW

03:13:50.685 --> 03:13:52.354
MOST PEOPLE TRY TO ACCOMPLISH

03:13:52.420 --> 03:13:53.855
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HAVE A-

03:13:53.922 --> 03:13:55.457
LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING FOR

03:13:55.523 --> 03:13:56.658
SINGLE PARENTS IN PARTICULAR

03:13:56.725 --> 03:13:58.994
HOW HARD IT IS- AND EVEN IF

03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:01.029
THEY'RE- IN A TWO PARENT. YOU

03:14:01.096 --> 03:14:04.733
KNOW SITUATION THEY THEY- THEY

03:14:04.799 --> 03:14:06.735
CAN REALLY FIGURE OUT THAT WITH

03:14:06.801 --> 03:14:08.370
ONE OF YOU IT'S HARD. SO I

03:14:08.436 --> 03:14:09.637
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO

03:14:09.704 --> 03:14:10.972
ARE REALLY TRYING TO COMPLY AND

03:14:11.039 --> 03:14:13.475
TRYING TO DO RIGHT. UNDERSTAND

03:14:13.541 --> 03:14:15.377
WHAT HOW WHAT THE LEGAL

03:14:15.443 --> 03:14:16.711
DEFINITION YEP NOT A

03:14:16.778 --> 03:14:18.179
COMMONSENSE DEFINITION OF

03:14:18.246 --> 03:14:19.581
REASONABLE. BUT A LEGAL

03:14:19.647 --> 03:14:21.683
DEFINITION OF REASONABLE AND

03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:22.884
THAT'S HARD TO DO SO COULD YOU

03:14:22.951 --> 03:14:24.853
GO THROUGH AGAINYOU SAID THIS

03:14:24.919 --> 03:14:26.388
IS. SO COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE

03:14:26.454 --> 03:14:28.523
BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW QUOTE QUOTE

03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:30.959
REASONABLE AND QUOTE YEP. AND

03:14:31.026 --> 03:14:32.927
THEN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE SCOPES

03:14:32.994 --> 03:14:37.632
OF THE SURE THINGS. YES SO- IT

03:14:37.699 --> 03:14:39.000
REQUIRES COME. AND WHICH COULD

03:14:39.067 --> 03:14:41.503
BE WORK FROM HOME YOU KNOW

03:14:41.569 --> 03:14:42.570
WHICH WAS SORT OF THE EXAMPLE

03:14:42.637 --> 03:14:45.106
THAT WAS- THE LAWYER WHO WAS

03:14:45.173 --> 03:14:46.775
READING THE STATEMENT RIGHT-

03:14:46.841 --> 03:14:47.809
OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING FROM

03:14:47.876 --> 03:14:49.110
HOME CAN SHE WORK FROM HOME SHE

03:14:49.177 --> 03:14:50.211
HAS TO DO SOMETHING WITH HER

03:14:50.278 --> 03:14:52.480
CHILD YOU KNOW- IS IT CAN I.

03:14:52.547 --> 03:14:54.582
YOU KNOW MY KIDS IN THE SUCH

03:14:54.649 --> 03:14:55.150
SEVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD

03:14:55.216 --> 03:14:56.584
HAVE BOMB THREATS AT MY SCHOOL.

03:14:56.651 --> 03:14:58.720
YOU KNOW AND MY MOM HAVE TO

03:14:58.787 --> 03:14:59.587
COME PICK ME UP AND IT WOULD BE

03:14:59.654 --> 03:15:00.955
AN HOUR OUT OF HER DAY WERE SHE

03:15:01.022 --> 03:15:02.157
NEED TO GO DO THAT. SHE WANT TO

03:15:02.223 --> 03:15:04.059
TAKE A WHOLE DAY OFF OF WORK IN

03:15:04.125 --> 03:15:05.060
ORDER TO DO THAT BUT WANTED TO

03:15:05.126 --> 03:15:06.428
USE SOME OF THAT TIME. RIGHT

03:15:06.494 --> 03:15:08.329
AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

03:15:08.396 --> 03:15:09.030
EXAMPLES SORT OF A REASONABLE

03:15:09.097 --> 03:15:11.299
ACCOMMODATION. FOR KNOWN FAMILY

03:15:11.366 --> 03:15:12.700
RESPONSIBILITIES SO THESE ARE

03:15:12.767 --> 03:15:14.002
KNOWN RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN

03:15:14.069 --> 03:15:15.537
APPLICANT OR EMPLOYEE RELATED

03:15:15.603 --> 03:15:17.605
TO OBLIGATION. ARISING FROM

03:15:17.672 --> 03:15:18.306
NEEDED TO CARE FOR A MINOR

03:15:18.373 --> 03:15:20.175
CHILD OR CARE RECIPIENT SO

03:15:20.241 --> 03:15:21.976
COULD BE AN OLDER PARENT. OR A

03:15:22.043 --> 03:15:23.611
DISABLED PERSON IN YOUR LIFE

03:15:23.678 --> 03:15:25.113
THAT YOU YOU CARE FOR ARE NOT

03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:27.148
THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER- SCHOOL

03:15:27.215 --> 03:15:28.783
OR PLACE OF CARE IS CLOSED OR

03:15:28.850 --> 03:15:30.618
OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE. SO THAT

03:15:30.685 --> 03:15:31.719
IS THE NARROW FOCUS OF THE

03:15:31.786 --> 03:15:35.323
BILL- IN ADDITION TO THAT- IF

03:15:35.390 --> 03:15:37.592
THERE IS UNDUE HARDSHIP TO THE-

03:15:37.659 --> 03:15:39.794
EMPLOYER- WHICH IS DEFINED AS

03:15:39.861 --> 03:15:40.929
SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY OR

03:15:40.995 --> 03:15:43.031
EXPENSE. SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU

03:15:43.098 --> 03:15:44.065
WORK AT A SEVEN ELEVEN YOU'RE

03:15:44.132 --> 03:15:45.834
THE ONLY EMPLOYEE THERE. AND

03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:47.068
SOMETHING HAPPENS THEY HAVE TO

03:15:47.135 --> 03:15:48.236
SHUT THE SHOP DOWN IF THEY

03:15:48.303 --> 03:15:49.604
CAN'T FIND SOMEONE TO COME IN.

03:15:49.671 --> 03:15:51.606
THAT WOULD BE UNDUE HARDSHIP-

03:15:51.673 --> 03:15:53.608
WHICH WOULD NOT THEN QUALIFY

03:15:53.675 --> 03:15:54.676
FOR THIS AND I AGREE WITH YOU I

03:15:54.742 --> 03:15:57.045
THINK MOST EMPLOYERS. YOU KNOW

03:15:57.112 --> 03:15:58.680
THEY WANT TO BE ACCOMMODATING

03:15:58.746 --> 03:16:00.348
TO THEIR TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND

03:16:00.415 --> 03:16:01.883
I THINK MOST EMPLOYEES WANT TO

03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:02.917
DO A GOOD JOB AT THEIR PLACE OF

03:16:02.984 --> 03:16:04.719
EMPLOYMENT- BUT THERE ARE

03:16:04.786 --> 03:16:05.854
CIRCUMSTANCES IN SOME OF THE

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:06.988
STUDIES THAT I MENTIONED IN MY-

03:16:07.055 --> 03:16:08.990
INITIAL STATEMENTS. DO WILL

03:16:09.057 --> 03:16:10.458
POINT TO THE FACT THAT WE DO

03:16:10.525 --> 03:16:11.693
NEED I THINK TO WRAP HER ARMS A

03:16:11.759 --> 03:16:12.594
LITTLE BIT MORE AROUND THIS AND

03:16:12.660 --> 03:16:13.428
I'M VERY MINDFUL OF THE

03:16:13.495 --> 03:16:15.163
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY

03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:16.131
RIGHT NOW AND DISCOVERED

03:16:16.197 --> 03:16:18.032

MAJORITY. YOU KNOW VERY COUNCIL

BUSINESS BUSINESSES I TALK TO.

03:16:28.409 --> 03:16:29.577
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE

03:16:29.644 --> 03:16:31.379
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCESAND I

03:16:31.446 --> 03:16:32.647
AGREE I THINK THAT DEFINITIONS

03:16:32.714 --> 03:16:37.152

03:16:41.055 --> 03:16:41.589
TO DO SO BECAUSE I DO WANT TO

03:16:41.656 --> 03:16:43.158
CREATE A THOUGHTFUL BILL. AND

03:16:43.224 --> 03:16:44.959
ON ON SCOPES WOULD SCOPE

03:16:45.026 --> 03:16:45.894
INCLUDE AS HARDSHIP FOR

DISCOURSE. WHAT ABOUT SOME ARE

03:16:57.272 --> 03:16:57.772

COST. ACCOMMODATION AND WHAT

03:19:44.806 --> 03:19:46.474
THAT COULD MEAN. I'M A LITTLE

PROBABLY NEED THIS THE MOST ARE

03:20:05.159 --> 03:20:07.095
LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO

03:20:07.161 --> 03:20:08.763
UTILIZE THAT. SO I'M NOT SAYING

03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:10.431
THIS IS A WAIT THE APPROACH TO

03:20:10.498 --> 03:20:12.400
GO OR NOT BUT- I CAN'T HELP BUT

03:20:12.467 --> 03:20:13.234
WONDER IN SOME OF THE THINGS

03:20:13.301 --> 03:20:14.469
ARE GETTING CONFUSED AND I

03:20:14.535 --> 03:20:15.503
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:20:15.570 --> 03:20:17.038
REMIND PEOPLE YOU ABSOLUTELY

03:20:17.105 --> 03:20:18.072
CAN TAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF

03:20:18.139 --> 03:20:20.274
THE DAY- IF YOUR CHILD IS SICK

03:20:20.341 --> 03:20:21.809
WE BROKE THOSE PROTECTIONS THIS

03:20:21.876 --> 03:20:24.278
BODY DID IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN I

03:20:24.345 --> 03:20:26.180
THINK I'M SO SICK LEAVE YOU

03:20:26.247 --> 03:20:27.682
KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

03:20:27.749 --> 03:20:29.050
EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE DOES

03:20:29.117 --> 03:20:32.520
MATTER HOW SMALL. THE EMPLOYER

03:20:32.587 --> 03:20:34.522
IS WHICH IS GOOD IT'S FAIR IT'S-

03:20:34.589 --> 03:20:36.424
IMPORTANT- AND I WANT PEOPLE TO

03:20:36.491 --> 03:20:37.825
UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT

03:20:37.892 --> 03:20:39.761
RIGHT NOW- IF THEY HAVE ACCRUED

03:20:39.827 --> 03:20:41.295
SICK LEAVE. IT'S PROBABLY NOT

03:20:41.362 --> 03:20:42.597
ENOUGH ACCRUED SICK LEAVE WHERE

03:20:42.663 --> 03:20:44.198
BILL FOR THAT. BUT I'M

03:20:44.265 --> 03:20:45.666
WONDERING IF THIS THE

03:20:45.733 --> 03:20:48.102
UTILIZATION OF ALREADY- PAID

03:20:48.169 --> 03:20:51.739
TIME OFF. TO BE EXPANDED FOR

03:20:51.806 --> 03:20:53.374
THIS PURPOSE MIGHT BETTER FIT

03:20:53.441 --> 03:20:55.610
IN THAT STATUTE. I THINK YOU

03:20:55.676 --> 03:20:56.911
KNOW BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE

03:20:56.978 --> 03:20:59.614
TRYING TO. PUT SOMETHING IN A

03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:01.215
DIFFERENT STATUTE THAT MAYBE I

03:21:01.282 --> 03:21:02.216
I'M STILL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

03:21:02.283 --> 03:21:03.885
JUST A THOUGHT. THAT IT MIGHT

03:21:03.951 --> 03:21:06.320
BE THAT WE JUST. COULD EXPAND

03:21:06.387 --> 03:21:09.023
THE UTILIZATION OF PAID TIME

03:21:09.090 --> 03:21:09.991
OFF THAT WE ARE SURE I MEAN AND

03:21:10.057 --> 03:21:11.426
I'M HAPPY TO DEFINITELY LOOK

03:21:11.492 --> 03:21:12.260
INTO THAT BECAUSE I THINK. I'M

03:21:12.326 --> 03:21:14.695
NOT. MARRIED TO THIS IDEA THAT

03:21:14.762 --> 03:21:15.997
HAS TO BE THIS WAY BUT WHAT I

03:21:16.063 --> 03:21:17.732
AM FOCUSED ON IS PROVIDING THE

03:21:17.799 --> 03:21:18.933
ACCOMMODATION RIGHT SUPER

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.002

MILWAUKEE ELSE WAS THE

03:21:23.504 --> 03:21:25.640

REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IS IT

03:21:40.188 --> 03:21:41.589
TOO BROAD BUT IT ALSO ISN'T SO

03:21:41.656 --> 03:21:43.357
NARROW THAT IT EXCLUDES.

03:21:43.424 --> 03:21:44.959
