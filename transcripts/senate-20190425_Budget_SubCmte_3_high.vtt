HOW PEOPLE TOUCH LOTS OF

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.717
DIFFERENT PLACES AND THINKING

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:52.752
ABOUT HOW WE BRING THAT ALL

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:53.119

OUT NOT VERY GOOD -- AND THE

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.625
TRUE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS IS

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:01.861
THAT -- PEOPLE GET MORE OR

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:04.563
HEALTH PROBLEMS SO I MEAN THAT'S

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.698
WHY WE WANNA BUMP IT UP THAT ARE

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:06.465
AS YOU SAY.

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:07.099
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HOW HIGH IT

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:07.700
IS IS THIS IS THE RIGHT NUMBER

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.735
AT THE RIGHT TIME RIGHT AND I

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.604
WOULD STILL SAY THAT PROBABLY

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.439
THAT'S WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.741
WERE STILL AT THE LOW END AND

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:16.342
THINKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS WE

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:19.545
CAN DO -- SO WHAT'S THE GOAL

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:24.183
THEN WERE AT FORTY THREE POINT.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.117
NINE THE HOPE IS THAT I MEAN I

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:27.453
KNOW IF SO BUT SO UNDER THE

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.954
DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.290
THE MOLE -- WAS TO GO UP TEN

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:34.827
PERCENTAGE POINTS -- FROM THE

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:36.062
BASE OVER THE FIVE YEARS RENTS

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:39.065
WHAT BUT THAT WAS ONLY HOW HIGH

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:40.199
THAT WAS IT.

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:44.470
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FIFTY FIFTY

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:44.870
FOUR YEAH.

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.172
I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY I DON'T

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.373
KNOW THAT I MIGHT HAVE IT IN

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.374
HERE IF I ACTUALLY THERE IS A

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.076
LOW NUMBER TO A NOT SO LOW

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:52.144
NUMBER IT'S 10% AND I'M NOT

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.313
SAYING IT'S EASY TO DO THE 10%.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.782
EVEN EVEN AT 10% IT'S THE WHOLE

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:57.383
YEAH AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.217
ABOUT AND HIS MERRY SAID THE

00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:00.453
NUMBERS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU CUT

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:00.986
THEM WHETHER THEY COME IN

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:02.822
ANNUALLY OR THEY COME IN EVERY

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.423
SIX MONTHS AS AS RECOMMENDED.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.858
I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.927
WE'RE LOOKING FOR AT LEAST A 60%

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:09.495
GLOBALIZATION RATE FOR CHILDREN

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.197
AND SO THAT IS KIND OF CERTAINLY

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:14.233
THE OVERALL GOAL AND I KNOW THAT --

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.669
UNDER THE DTI WE HAVE BEEN --

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.571
IMPROVING OUR UTILIZATION MORE

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:20.539
THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY AGREED TO

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:21.674
RISE TO TERMS OF THE WAIVER SO I

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.208
THINK.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:23.742
YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID A LOT OF

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:25.144
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE BUT AGAIN

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.412
WE'RE STILL ALWAYS LOOKING FOR

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.280
THAT AT LEAST 60% WOULD BE KIND

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:29.882
OF THE THE PLACE IN WHICH WE

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:30.950
WOULD CONSIDER THAT TO BE

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.619
ACCEPTABLE OKAY.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.754
ALL RIGHT SO.

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:36.655
I THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.891
STRETCH GOALS IS BECAUSE BECAUSE

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.526
EVEN AT THE GOAL WE SAT.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.527
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID IT

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.661
THERE AND THERE'S SOME

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:44.263
CONSEQUENCES NOT MEETING THAT

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.265
PARTICULAR GOAL.

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:47.933
EVEN WE HAD IT I'M LIKE OKAY

DOWN -- AS ARRESTING THE DECAY

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:51.476
MAY ALLOW FOR A CHILD TO BECOME

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:52.277
MORE COOPERATIVE AS THEY GET

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:54.346

TRADITIONAL RESTORATION.

00:21:58.617 --> 00:21:59.351
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:00.018
MAIN SIDE EFFECT OF STF IS

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:00.652
THOUGHT THE APPLICATION OF THE

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:02.087
LIQUID SIGNIFICANTLY DOES COLORS

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.922
THE TOOTH INTO A DARK BLACK

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:04.456
COLOR.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:05.557
WELL THIS ON A STATIC SIDE

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:06.491
EFFECTS CAN BE TROUBLESOME I

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:08.160
WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THAT THE

BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THIS RESULT.

00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:11.363
I IN THE RIGHT SITUATION

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.938
AS A PRIVATE PRACTITIONER -- I

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.206
ACTUALLY APPLIED STF TO A TWO

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.674
YEAR OLD AND EVEN A NINETY TWO

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:25.110

STF OVER TRADITIONAL NITROUS

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:31.783
OXIDE INJECTIONS A NORMAL

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.552
FEELINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT --

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:34.419
THE NINETY TWO YEAR OLD HAD

00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:35.887
DEMENTIA AND HIS FAMILY DID NOT

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:37.756
WANT.

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.257
TO EXPAND YOU KNOW A TREMENDOUS

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:40.559
AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY INTO

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:41.927

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:44.062
ABLE TO REMOVE THE DECAY QUICKLY

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:49.234
PLACE STF AND GO ABOUT OUR WAY.

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:50.535
SO EXPANDING COVERAGE OF STF AS

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:51.136
A MEDICAL DENTAL BENEFIT WOULD

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:51.937
ENCOURAGE PROVIDERS TO EXPLORE

A BRUSH DIRECTLY TO THE DECAY --

00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:57.996
IT TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE OR TWO

00:24:58.063 --> 00:24:58.930
BEFORE THE DARK COLOR STARTS TO

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:00.899
SET IN AND THE DARK COLOR ONLY

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.234
SETS IN WHERE TO QUE IS SO IT

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.169
DOESN'T COLOR THE ENTIRE TO

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:05.704
SPOCK JUST WHERE THE COMPANY WAS

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.705

DARK TEASE THAT MAY.

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:21.913
HAVE BEEN DONE FROM LETS IT FLY

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.814
MAKE THEM -- ANXIOUS TO APPLY

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:24.749
FOR A JOB OR MAKE FRIENDS OR

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:25.583
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.217
CERTAINLY IS A DENTIST I KNOW

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:28.620
YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS --

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:29.354
TO PEOPLES -- YOU KNOW THE

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:31.523

WELL OF COURSE OR HEALTH.

00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:33.725
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE SAY

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:34.960
WELL I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:36.328
YOU'LL DENNIS AGAIN USES TOO

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:37.329
MUCH AND NOW WE ARE AND PEOPLE

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:40.098
ARE GOING TO BE HARMED BECAUSE

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:41.533
WELL CERTAINLY YEAH WE'RE STUCK

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.201
HERE TO DECAY BUT THERE MIGHT BE

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.235
A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO OVER

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:45.103
USE THAT.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.806
AND NOW PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING I

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:55.680
FEEL ASHAMED OF THEIR TEETH AND

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:58.116
SO FORTH.

00:26:58.183 --> 00:26:59.417
SO IT IS IT IS IS THAT A REAL

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:00.318
ANY AND HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN IS

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:00.652
THAT.

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:01.953
IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:02.721
COMES UP FOR WITH PARENTS

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:03.488
ESPECIALLY IN NO WE'RE TALKING

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:04.255
ABOUT VERY YOUNG CHILDREN THAT

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:05.423
WE TYPICALLY USE THIS ON OR

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.359
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS --

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:09.094
WITH THE THE LIKE THE YOUNGEST

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:09.761
I'VE USED IT ON HIS ONE YEAR OLD

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:10.929
IT'S IT'S UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:12.163
A ONE YEAR OLD TO BE ABLE.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.765
TO YOU KNOW SENATE DENTAL CHAIR

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:15.066
AND GET NITROUS OXIDE OR GO

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:15.734
UNDER SEDATION OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:15.934
THAT.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.469
SO THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO KIND OF

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:18.536
PAUSE THE DECAY AND MAYBE EVEN

00:27:18.603 --> 00:27:19.537
SAVE THE TOOTH FROM EXTRACTION

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:22.107
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UNTIL THE

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:24.009
PATIENT IS.

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:25.010
OLD ENOUGH TO SIT IN THE DENTAL

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:25.977
CHAIR AND DO NOT YOU KNOW

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:26.444
REGULAR TRADITIONAL.

00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:28.213
RESTORATIONS OR IF THEY'RE OLDER

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.781
YOU KNOW THE OLDER THEY GET.

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:31.583
YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY SAFER OR IT

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:32.650
COULD BE TO PUT THEM UNDER AN

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:33.918
ASCETIC ARE GENERAL ISSUES ARE

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:35.453
SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.888
IT'S JUST ANOTHER TOOL WE HAVE

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:39.357
IN OUR IN OUR BAG OF TRICKS TO

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:42.260
HELP STOP DECAY AND AND KEEP

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.962
TEETH AROUND OKAY SO YOU CAN

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.030
QUITE ANSWER MY QUESTION WITH.

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.065
THAT THIS SO I APPRECIATE IT'S

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:47.932
ANOTHER TOOL RIGHT.

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:51.469
BUT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID I'VE HEARD

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:54.005
SOME CONCERNS THAT.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.073
IT'S A TOOL IF IT'S BUSINESS AS

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.708
A CONSEQUENCE WHEN IT'S USED AND

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:58.510
IF IT'S OVER USED.

00:27:58.576 --> 00:27:59.511
RIGHT.

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:01.079
SO NO IT'S OKAY AND I KNOW YOU

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.547
WOULD NEVER DO THIS BUT NOW IT'S

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:03.148
OKAY SOME DATA SAID YOU KNOW

00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:04.816
WHAT I'M GOING TO USE A LOT OF

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.985
IT I CAN BILL FOR AT NOW THERE'S

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:08.019
AN OPPORTUNITY UPPER SAY THE

00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:09.320
PATIENT TO GET IT.

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:10.755
AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THE

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:11.790
PATIENTS GOING AROUND WITH BLACK

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:14.659
TEAS AND THOU THERE YOU KNOW AND

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.027
I I GUESS I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A

00:28:16.094 --> 00:28:18.029
WAY TO REVERSE THE BLACKNESS ITS

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:20.065
SILVER DINER SO IT THAT TENDS TO

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:20.799
GET.

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:21.833
PRETTY IMBEDDED IN THERE BUT

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.801
EXACTLY HOW BLACK TO THE TEETH

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.869
TURN AND IS THERE A WAY AND AND

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:26.404
AND WHAT'S THE DEAL WHAT IS THAT

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:29.040
THE RISK OF OF THAT KIND OF HARM

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:31.609
POTENTIALLY HAPPENING.

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:33.978
SO SOON AS HE'S QUITE DARK OR

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:36.247
ONE NOT I'M SURE CUT BY.

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:37.682
THAT TIME IT IS QUITE DARK ITEM

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:38.550
AND YEAH I MEAN IT'S IT'S I

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:39.317
THINK THAT'S WHERE THE INFORMED

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:40.318
CONSENT REALLY HAS TO COME INTO

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:40.919
PLAY I MEAN I CAN'T SPEAK TO

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:42.320
OTHER PEOPLE DOCTORS ARE GOING

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:43.688
TO OVER USE IT I DON'T THINK

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:44.255
THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT

00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:44.622
AREN'T.

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:46.357
OVER USED OR NOT UNDER UNDER

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:46.958
USED.

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:49.160
BUT IT'S FOR SURE A CONCERN I A

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:50.295
SHOW ALL OF MY PATIENTS THE

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:51.796
PICTURES OF IT SO THAT THE

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:53.098
PARENTS CAN MAKE AN INFORMED

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:55.533
DECISION -- BUT THERE ARE WAYS

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.501
TO COVER UP THE BLACK YOU CAN

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.137
PUT REGULAR FILLING OVER ME ARE

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:00.905
ON TOP OF IT AND KIND OF BLENDED

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:01.606
IN WITH THE TO THE LITTLE BIT

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:04.642
MORE -- I'VE DONE NOT FOR

00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:05.343
PATIENTS THAT ARE MORE

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.711
COOPERATIVE AND THEY'RE STILL

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:07.278
NOT GETTING ANESTHETICS ARE

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:08.613
STILL NOT GETTING DRILLED ON OR

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.248
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT DOES COVER

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:11.449
IT UP SO IT'S NOT AS DARK IT'LL

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:13.184
BE A LITTLE BIT GRAY KIND OF A

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.153
GREATER TONE -- SO THERE ARE

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.721
WAYS OF MAKING IT LOOK MORE

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.957
AESTHETIC -- MORE AESTHETIC -- I

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:20.558
THINK IT'S MOSTLY A CONCERN FOR

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.326
FRONT TEETH I DON'T THINK

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:22.760
PARENTS ARE SINCERELY CARE TOO

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.262
MUCH ABOUT THE BACK TEETH IT'S

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:25.196
MORE WHEN IT IS CLEAN THE FRONT

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.399
TEETH -- AND SO I THINK THAT SHE

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:40.612
MAY HAVE SOME SOME GOOD COMMENTS

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:41.212
GOOD KNOWING THAT HER DAUGHTER

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.914
HAS HAD IT.

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.449
BEST SO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:45.617
SO WE WE WERE WELL AWARE THAT

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:46.718
THE TOOTH MAY BECOME DARKER AND

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:48.887
I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR BLACK TO

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.054
USE IT'S REALLY SCARY.

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:51.556
LIFELESS TO THIS NOT BLACK IT IS

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:52.557
IT IS DARK WHERE THE TWO K. WISE

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:53.825
AND IT LOOKS ACTUALLY LIKE A

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:55.527
SMALL SILVER FILLING.

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:56.895
I SHE ONE OF HER MOUTH TO SHOW

00:29:56.961 --> 00:30:04.002
YOU I TRIED OUT -- FIVE JUSTIN.

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:05.203
BUT IT'S AND YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.673
WAYNE THE OPTIONS IT WAS STF OR

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.308
ANASTASIA AND I'M SORRY BUT AS A

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:12.043
PARENT I'M GOING TO CHOOSE STF

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.544
OVER ANASTASIA ANY DAY.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.178
AND WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:13.912
FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AND

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:15.013
ULTIMATELY IF WE NEEDED TO

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:16.181
EXPLORE FURTHER OPTIONS WITH OUR

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:18.349
DENTIST WE WOULD DO THAT BUT YOU

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:20.084
KNOW A BLACK SMALL BLACK SPOT IS

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:21.219
IS.

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:22.720
RELATIVELY SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:23.721
AND IN THE END YOU MENTIONED

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.323
ONLY THE REALLY ONLY STICKS TO

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.258
THE PART THAT WAS THE CASE SO

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:28.092
IT'S NOT LIKE ONE TO APPLIES IT

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.427
IT'S GOING LIKE COME ALL OF THE

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.228
TEETH IT'S JUST KIND OF THE

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:31.696
SPOTS GOING TO THE DARK SPOTS

00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:33.164

WITH THAT THAT COULD BE A

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.097
SIGNIFICANT BARRIER IF PEOPLE

DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:34.278
THOSE PRICES AND THE COSTS THAT

DETAIL IN A MINUTE.

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.881
AND THEN THE SECOND -- PART OF

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:12.583
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLED FOR

BUT ALSO.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.561
CHALLENGING US IS A DEPARTMENT

00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:25.062
TO WORK WITH OTHER PURCHASERS IN

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:27.098
THE STATE AND PAYERS TO COME UP

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:29.734
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW WE

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.770
CAN CHANGE -- THE OVERALL COST

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:33.804
OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:35.072
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:36.340
ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING THOSE

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:37.975
RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR THE

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.043
GOVERNOR.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.778
AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEYOND JUST

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:44.215
THE STATE -- PROGRAM -- IN THAT

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:46.650
WE AS MEDI CAL HAVE -- VERY

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:49.086
CONCRETE FEDERAL AND STATE

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:51.388
STATUTE AROUND WHAT WE CAN DO AS

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:53.324
A MEDICAID PROGRAM THE PRICING

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.191
THAT WERE ALLOWED TO RECEIVE AS

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:56.994
A AS A COMPONENT OF OUR UNIQUE

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:58.329
STATUS.

00:39:58.395 --> 00:39:59.430
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE AS A STATE --

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:00.865
NEGOTIATE AND RECEIVE

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:03.000
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON THE FEE

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.502
FOR SERVICE -- PROGRAM AS IT

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:06.070
EXISTS TODAY AS WELL AS THE

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:07.138
MANDATORY RIVER REBATES THAT

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.672
WERE SET IN PLACE NOT ONLY BY

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:09.774
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT BUT

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.176
ENHANCE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.310
CARE ACT.

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:17.148
SO I THINK -- IN ALL OF THAT --

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:19.216
WE CONTINUE -- TO SPEND

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:20.684
APPROXIMATELY TWELVE BILLION

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.286
DOLLARS AS A STATE PROGRAM

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:23.921
ACROSS BOTH MANAGED CARE AND FEE

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:26.023
FOR SERVICETODAY -- OBVIOUSLY

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:29.393
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS LOOKING --

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.095
TO AGGREGATE THAT PURCHASE SEEN

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:33.764
OUT -- F. TWO DISTINCT YOU KNOW

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:35.199
AREAS IN TERMS OF WE ONLY GET

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.634

THAT FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:40.805
AND INSTEAD RETURN ALL OF THOSE --

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.540
LIVES INTO FEE FOR SERVICE SUCH

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:43.874
THAT WERE NEGOTIATING RECEIVING

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:45.409
SUPPLEMENT A REBATES FOR THE

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:47.478
ENTIRE THRTEEN MILLION --

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:50.581
MEMBER PROGRAM -- BUT OBVIOUSLY

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:52.550
REBATES OR NOT THE GOING TO

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:54.051
CHANGE THE UNDERLYING COST OF

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:54.819
THE DRUGS SO I THINK THAT'S

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:55.820
WHERE THE OTHER ADDITIONAL

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.221
THINKING AND RECOMMENDATIONS

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.989
CERTAINLY COME AND FOR FOR

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.624
PURPOSES OF THE BROADER

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:02.626
EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUESTS -- AS

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:04.128
IT PERTAINS TO THE CAR ABOUT --

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:07.631
SPECIFICALLY -- WE HAVE SEVERAL

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:09.366
REASONS FOR DOING THIS NOT JUST

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.935
FOR THE REBATES AND FOR THE

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:12.770
AGGREGATION OF THE PURCHASING

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:13.604
POWER.

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.073
BUT AS WE LOOK TO THE RENEWAL OF

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.042
OUR WAIVERS AND TO THE CONTINUED

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:20.244
KIND OF EVOLUTION OF OUR PROGRAM --

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:22.012
THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.547
MANAGED CARE BENEFIT ACROSS THE

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.282
VARIOUS MODELS ACROSS THE

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:27.885
COUNTIES -- ACROSS PLAN TO PLAN

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.854
WE HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT NOT JUST

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.322
FOR PHARMACY BUT FOR A LOT OF

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:33.457
OTHER BENEFITS -- BENEFICIARIES

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:34.859
DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY THAT

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:37.361
THEY LIVE AND HAVE DIFFERENT --

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:38.729
ACCESS TO DIFFERENT SERVICES AT

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.865
DIFFERENT TIMES AND SO THE

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.266
STANDARDIZATION OF THE PHARMACY

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.701
BENEFIT IS ONE THAT WE THINK IS

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:46.937
BOTH -- IMPORTANT BUT ALSO IN

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:49.673
RETURNING IT TO FEE FOR SERVICE --

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.208
THE CONTRACTING PHARMACIES THAT

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:52.743
WE HAVE IN FEE FOR SERVICE --

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.079
REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 97% OF

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.380
THE PHARMACIES IN THE STATE OF

00:41:56.447 --> 00:41:58.682
CALIFORNIA -- INDIVIDUALS WILL

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:01.619
NO LONGER -- HAVE CHANGES IF

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.220
THEY CHANGE FROM EITHER COUNTIES

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:04.855
OR DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE PLAN

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:06.223
ASSIGNMENTS FROM THE STANDPOINT

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.058
THAT WE WOULD BE -- OBVIOUSLY

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.393
JUST MANAGING THAT PHARMACY

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.494
BENEFIT ON A FEE FOR SERVICE

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:12.062
BASIS SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT.

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:13.230
CHALLENGE WHICH I THINK IS IN

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.732
SOME CASES ARE THE LARGEST

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:17.801
NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET --

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.703
AROUND PURSE TIONS IN MANAGED

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.838
CARE WHEN PEOPLE.

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.339
CHANGE AND ROLE IN PLANS AND SO --

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:24.108
THE CAR ABOUT -- WILL CONSIST OF

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:26.710
A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- ACTIVITIES

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:29.046
RELATING -- TO THE REMOVAL OF

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:31.448
THE COSTS -- FROM THE RATES AND

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.984
THE MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS TODAY

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.920
AND OBVIOUSLY LOOKING -- TO

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:38.555
IMPROVE THE EXISTING DATA THAT

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:40.791
WE GIVE TO THE PLAN SO RIGHT NOW

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:42.660
IT'S INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING --

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:44.528
DRUGS THAT ARE CARVED OUT OF THE

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.319
ISSUE ABOUT MANAGED CARE PLANS

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:44.688
ABILITY TO ACCESS OR MANAGE THE

PHARMACY BENEFIT AND DID YOU

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:48.192
HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT.

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:50.127
THAT I MEAN IT'S EASY TO

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:51.929
DISCOVER SAID OF WHAT THREE

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:53.097
FORTY B. -- REALLY IS SO WE HAVE

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:53.897
HAD.

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.799
A COUPLE OF YEARS OF ONGOING

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:58.102
DIALOGUE WITH THE THREE FORTY BE

00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:01.805
COVERED ENTITIES -- IN THAT --

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.474
WHEN A THREE FORTY B. AND TO T.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.009
BILLS THE FEE FOR SERVICE --

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.443
PROGRAM TODAY THEY BILL

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.412
ACQUISITION COSTS AND REIMBURSE

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.680
ACQUISITION COST PLUS THE

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.882
DISPENSING FEE.

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:12.416
AND MANAGE CARE THERE'S A

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:12.916
DIFFERENT.

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.618
PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN GOING

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.220
ON IN THAT THE MANAGED CARE

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:17.921
PLANS ARE REIMBURSING THOSE

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:19.790
THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES -- AN

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:22.860
AMOUNT -- THAT MAY OR MAY NOT --

00:44:22.926 --> 00:44:23.827
THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT AND NO

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.996
BECAUSE THE THREE FORTY BE

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.297
DISCOUNTS AND PRICING IN THAT

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.265
THE ENTITIES THEMSELVES

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.967
NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THE

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:32.102
MANUFACTURERS IS NOT KNOWN TO US --

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:34.271
SO WE HAVE HAD ONGOING DIALOGUE

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:35.839
ABOUT HOW DO WE KIND OF BOTH

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:37.841
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENTIAL BUT

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:39.877
ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:44:39.943 --> 00:44:41.345
WE THE STATE ARE NOT PAYING.

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.047
MORE FOR DRUGS THAN WE OTHERWISE

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:44.848
SHOULD BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:46.717
THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:47.518
PAYING.

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:49.019
A PRICE THAT IS NOT A THREE

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:50.587
FORTY BE PRICE THEY THEN TURN

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.689
THOSE COSTS BACK TO US AS A

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:53.223
STATE SO THERE'S A CONCERN

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.491
AROUND.

00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:56.560
PAIN -- FOR PAIN FOR COSTS THAT

00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:57.961
OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO IF

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:58.562
THEY WERE IN A FEE FOR SERVICE

00:44:58.629 --> 00:44:59.496
ENVIRONMENT.

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:00.697
I THINK AS PART OF THE

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.099
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:05.335

TO SUPPORT THE SAFETY NET --

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:47.811
THAT'S A POLICY DECISION THAT

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:49.279
WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE IN TERMS

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:51.648
OF YOU KNOW.

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:53.183

A LITTLE WHILE.

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.907
I DOES NOT THAT MUCH LONGER

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:50.207

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.978
OKAY RIGHT WHAT COMES FROM LA --

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:57.347
FIRST.

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:58.749
BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA SO -- WE

00:46:58.815 --> 00:46:59.950
RECENTLY RELEASED REPORT

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:00.984
ANALYZING THE CARVE OUT OF

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:02.953
PHARMACY SERVICES AND MEDI CAL --

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:03.787
WHERE WE FIND THAT -- WE'RE WE

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:04.721
AGREE REALLY WITH THE

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:05.289
ADMINISTRATION THAT THE CAR

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.790
ABOUT IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.092
THAT SAVINGS FOR THE STATE --

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.727
AND POTENTIALLY IN THE HUNDREDS

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:12.796
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS WAS

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:15.465
NOTED IN THE IN THE GALLEY OR IN

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:17.701
THE BUDGET -- WE EAGERLY AWAIT

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:19.436
THE THE THE FISCAL ESTIMATE AS

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.505
WELL WE THINK THAT A LOT MUCH OF

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:22.906
THE SAVINGS COULD COME IN THE

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:25.108
FORM OF THAT TRANSFER OF SAVINGS

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:26.610
FROM THREE FORTY BE -- COVERED

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:28.245
ENTITIES OVER TO THE STATE

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:30.347
THROUGH -- THE STATE ULTIMATELY

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:32.049
PURCHASING THOSE DRUGS AT AT

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:34.218
LOWER COSTS -- THE OTHER SAVINGS

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:37.120
ARE LIKELY TO COME -- FROM JUST

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.256
THE TRANSITION OF SPENDING FROM

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:41.625
MANAGED CARE PLANS TO THE STATE

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:43.393
OBVIOUSLY FOR THE ACTUAL DRUG

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.295
BENEFIT WE WOULD BEAR THOSE

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:46.363
COSTS AND SO THERE'D BE

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.264
OFFSETTING COSTS.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:48.332
BUT A PORTION OF THAT TRIP --

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:50.734
THAT TRANSFER OVER TO THE STATE --

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.769
COULD BE IN SAVINGS THAT THROUGH

00:47:52.836 --> 00:47:56.073
LESSER ADMINISTRATIVE AND MAY I

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.608
SAY PROFIT ACCESS.

00:47:57.674 --> 00:48:00.544
FUNDING -- FOR FOR THOSE MANAGED

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:01.778
CARE PLANS.

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:02.813
ULTIMATELY WITH THE THE CARD

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:03.947
THAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE A MAJOR

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:06.316
IMPACT ON THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:08.018
WITHIN THE MADE MEDI CAL PROGRAM

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.019
WE AGREE THAT THE STANDARD OF

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:10.354
THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.990
BENEFIT COULD BE BENEFICIAL --

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:14.625
FOR FOR BENEFICIARIES.

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.193
MANAGED CARE PLANS BEAU WOULD

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.928
WOULD RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:20.230
FUNDING GOING FORWARD --

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:21.131
INCLUDING POTENTIALLY ON THERE

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:21.898
FOR THE TIME FOR THEIR

00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:23.433
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SO

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.736
FORTH -- THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:27.971
WHAT POTENTIALLY LOSE -- SOME OF

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.239
THE NET REVENUES THAT THEY

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:31.375
AREN'T CURRENTLY ON ON THE THREE

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:32.843
FORTY BE SIGNED AND SO -- WE

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.311
DEFINITELY THINK WE I THINK WE

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:35.679
AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:38.815
THAT -- YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:40.851
THAT THOSE -- OF THIS THE

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.219
TRANSFER OF THOSE SAVINGS

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:44.354
RESULTS IN SORT OF HARM TO THOSE

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.323
INDIVIDUALS PRO -- TO THOSE

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.557
INDIVIDUAL COVERED ENTITIES AND

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:49.693
THAT THAT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED --

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.995
THAT YOU KNOW A SPECIFIC STATE

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:57.934
POLICY CAN BE CRAFTED TO TWO

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:59.770
INCH -- THEIR CONTINUED

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.104
VIABILITY -- AND THEN -- WHAT WE

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:02.005
DON'T ANTICIPATE THEN ON THE

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:03.373
OTHER END MAJOR IMPACT ON DRUG

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.207
MANUFACTURERS -- THE

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:04.875
ADMINISTRATION HAS ASSERTED THAT

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:05.375
IT DOES HAVE UNILATERAL

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:07.544
AUTHORITY TO UNDER CURRENT STATE

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:09.446
LAW TO AFFECT THE CARVE OUT --

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:11.415
AND WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT --

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.183
WITH THAT ASSESSMENT HOWEVER WE

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.217
DO STILL THINK THAT THE

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.519
LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:18.255
SIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY -- TO AND

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:19.623
AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO PROVIDE

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:22.192
INPUT INTO BOTH WHETHER AND HOW

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:23.694
THIS CARVE OUT PROCEEDS.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.595
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS -- THAT THE

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:27.397
COVER WILL ULTIMATELY REQUIRED

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:30.701
NEW STATE RESOURCES -- FOR DH

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:32.903
YES -- TO CONDUCT PRIOR

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:35.238
AUTHORIZATION REVIEWS -- AND TO

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:37.140
DO A VARIETY OF OTHER ACTIVITIES

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.508
TO THE ULTIMATELY SEND THE

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.944
INFORMATION -- FROM THE STATE TO

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:42.346
MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ENSURE

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:43.313
CONTINUED COULD CARE

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.448
COORDINATION AT THE MANAGEDCARE

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.583
PLAN LEVEL AND SO THE STATE

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.051
CAN'T THE LEGISLATURE REALLY CAN

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:50.787
PROVIDE -- STRONG OVERSIGHT --

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:53.123
AND REALLY BEEN PUT INTO WHETHER

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.391
AND HOW THAT CARVE OUT PROCEEDS

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.425
TROUGH ITS APPROVAL OR

00:49:55.492 --> 00:50:00.030
REJECTION OF THE STATE RESOURCES.

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:00.731
THERE IS A THERE IS MUCH

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:02.366
INFORMATION THAT IS MISSING ON

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.633
ULTIMATELY HOW THIS CARVE OUT

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.335
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND IT'S

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.738
LIKELY IMPACTS -- AND SO WE DO

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:09.272
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:11.475

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:30.527
WOULD LIKE TO SEE PERSPECTIVE

THEIR BENEFICIARIES SINCE THEY

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:39.035
WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT ROLE --

PUT IN PLACE SO THAT -- MANAGE

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.712
CARE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOW SUBJECT

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.547
TO A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW -- FOR

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:56.753
BENEFICIAL GOING FORWARD.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.655
AND THEN -- ALSO ANALYSIS OF OF

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.657
FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO TO THIS

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.592
PURSUIT SO WE DO IN OUR REPORT

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:07.097
BUT AND ULTIMATELY HERE HAPPY TO

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:12.536
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THOSE OR

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:14.838
OTHER ASPECTS OF THE INITIATIVE.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:15.605
I DO HAVE QUESTIONS WITH

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:17.974
FINANCING ENDING ALL RIGHT.

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:18.642
SO I'VE BEEN LISTENING CAREFULLY

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:19.443
TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:19.743
[inaudible]

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.912
SO.

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:24.781
WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY?

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.450
SO WE HAVE A POTENTIAL FOR WE'RE

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:28.452
GOING AGAIN ESTIMATES FOR

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:31.321
SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION. NINETY

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:32.322
THOUSAND SURF KIND OF

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:34.324
ANTICIPATED REPOSE BUT ALSO WAY

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:36.593
HEARD YOU SAY WAS OF MOST OF

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.594
THAT WAS GOING TO COME FROM

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.362
ESSENTIALLY SHUTTING DOWN THREE

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:40.997
FORTY BE.

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:41.731
I'M NOT NOTS FROM ACTUALLY

00:51:41.798 --> 00:51:43.767
SAVINGS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.001
MANUFACTURERS TECHTV SPECIALLY

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:46.203
SAID THAT.

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:48.071
NOT REALLY GOING TO SAY MY FIVE

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:48.972
SOON AFTER ACTORS BUT ASTHE

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:50.340
MONEY'S COMING FROM CLOSING

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:52.142
THREE FORTY B. WHICH IS NOT WHAT

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:53.109
I THINK WHEN PEOPLE HEARD THE

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:54.311
GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT THEY

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:55.378
WERE DISSIPATING THEY WERE

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:56.246
THINKING THAT.

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:57.647
STATE WAS GOING TO USE OUR

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:59.783
PURCHASING LEVERAGE IN ORDER TO

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.751
BE ABLE TO PURCHASE DRUGS OUT

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:04.087
LOWER PRICE AND THAT THAT'S

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:05.055
WHERE THE SAVINGS TO COME FROM.

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:05.589
WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:07.791
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW MUCH

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:09.826
SAVINGS THE STATE CAN GET FROM

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.161
THE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES.

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:12.796
ARE IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:13.864
MANAGED CARE PLANS CURRENTLY

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.132
NEGOTIATE REBATES WITH DRUG

00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:17.667
MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER FOR THOSE

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.069
STRUT THEIR DRUGS TO BE PLACED

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.237
ON THE FORMULARIES.

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:22.506
WE DO BELIEVE THAT THOSE REBATES

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:23.640
DID INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:25.008
FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.810
MANAGE CARE REBATES WITHIN THE

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.645
MEDICAID OUT WITHIN MEDICAID PER

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.347
PER GRAMS NATIONWIDE BUT WE

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:31.915
DON'T HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.650
OF THE EXTENT OF THOSE REBATES.

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:35.185
ULTIMATELY WHATEVER THE STATE

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:36.820
DOES RECEIVE IN SUPPLEMENTAL

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:39.122
REBATES -- THROUGH SORT OF THE

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:40.557
FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM -- THOSE

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:43.727
SAVINGS WOULD BE OFFSET AGAINST --

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:45.529
ANY SAVINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:47.531
PASSED ON TO THE STATE THROUGH

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:49.466
MANAGED CARE PLANS -- REBATES

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:50.800
WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:52.369
ULTIMATELY WE REALLY DON'T KNOW

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:53.870
THE NET IMPACT BUT WOULD LOOK WE

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:55.672
LOOK FOR TO EVALUATING THAT WHEN

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.541
WE DO SEE THE FISCAL ESTIMATE SO.

00:52:57.607 --> 00:52:59.543
NOTE NOT THERE'S NOT CERTAINTY

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.077
HERE AT ALL I MEAN THERE THERE

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:02.345
WOULDN'T BE ONCE WE SEE A FISCAL

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:03.980
ESTIMATE BUT WE SHOULD WE DO

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.682
HOPE FOR A LITTLE MORE CLARITY

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:07.083
ONCE THAT DOES COME OUT.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.451
THE ESTIMATE WILL BE ABLE TO

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:12.756
SHOW WHAT WHERE THE COMPONENTS

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:14.257
OF THE SAVINGS ARE COMING FROM.

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:14.457
OKAY.

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:17.294
ALL RIGHT.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.029
IT IS SO I'VE MET BUNCH ALARM

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:20.597
BELLS ARE GOING OFF RIGHT NOW.

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:23.567
BECAUSE THEY MOST OF IT IS

00:53:23.633 --> 00:53:24.568
COMING FROM THAT GIVE YOU.

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.803
OKAY.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.940
RIGHT WELL I MY CONCERN ITSELF

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:30.707
FIRST OF ALL I MEAN WE CAN.

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.609
WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT DEBATE

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:34.411
ABOUT THREE FORTY BE IN.

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:35.245
YOU KNOW IS.

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.681
IS A WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT.

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:40.150
NO ENTITIES ARE USING THESE MEN

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.719
AND YES AT SOMEWHAT ANECDOTAL.

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:43.286
AND I WAS THAT AGE RIGHT BUT

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:44.654
THEY'RE USING THEM TO PROVIDE

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:46.690
OTHER SERVICES MAYBE THERE'S A

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:47.791
DESIRE FOR MORE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.292
OF EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE SPENDING

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:52.162
THAT MONEY -- BUT ESSENTIALLY

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:54.264
WHAT I SEE THOUGH IN THE END IS

00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:55.265
IS THAT WE'RE STRIPPING THAT

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.800
MONEY AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO

00:53:56.866 --> 00:53:58.335
ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES THE

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.604
CLINICS PLANNED PARENTHOOD OTHER

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:04.341
PEOPLE WHO GET THREE FORTY B..

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:06.710
THEN WE GOT A GET THAT MONEY

00:54:06.776 --> 00:54:07.410
BACK TO THEM IN SOME WAY TOO

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:09.012
RIGHT TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:09.913
THEY WERE PAYING FOR UNLESS WE

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.114
JUST WANT TAKE WITH THE SERVICES

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:13.583
AS WELL -- SO THAT ESSENTIALLY

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.253
IS NOT A SAVINGS -- IT'S IT DID

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.722
IT IS BETTER TO TRANSFER SO OKAY

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:20.056
FINDER NOT GETTING IT THIS WAY

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:21.024
WE HAD TO PAY FOR ANOTHER WAY

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.125
UNLESS WE ACTUALLY SAY WE DON'T

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:24.427
WANT TO SERVICES ANYMORE.

00:54:24.494 --> 00:54:26.296
MY GUESS IS THE TYPE OF SERVICES

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:29.766
THEY'RE PROVIDING -- ARE

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.234
PROBABLY ONES THAT.

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:31.901
WE'LL HEAR FROM PEOPLE SAYING NO

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:34.471
THEY NEED TO HAVE THOSE SERVICES

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:36.706
I A I I I I I DON'T SEE THIS

00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:39.009
GROUPS BASICALLY TAKING MONEY

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.410
AND TO STICK IN YOUR POCKET AND

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:42.145
WALKING AWAY WITH IT I THINK

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:43.580
THEY'RE USING IT.

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:44.547
TO PROVIDE OTHER PEOPLE SERVE WE

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.650
CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:47.283
WHAT THE VALUE OF IT IS AND SO

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.051
FORTH.

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:53.523
BUT IT'S LIMITING THREE FORTY

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:54.691
BP'S.

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.726
WITH THAT MONEY ESSENTIALLY

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.294
SPRITE GOING BACK AND SOME OTHER

00:54:58.361 --> 00:55:01.064
MECHANISM. TWO PEOPLE FOR STUFF

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:01.965
I DON'T.

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:04.868
THE SERVICES IT'S NOT GOING TO

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.036
IT.

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:06.703
I I DON'T SEE THAT LIKE -- WELL

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:10.674
NOW WE HAVE SOME NEW MONEY.

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.208
THE INSTITUTE IT THOUGH I THINK

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:13.143
THAT'S TO TO MY COMMENTS EARLIER

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:13.977
THAT SAYS.

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:15.912
CERTAINLY THAT TRANSPARENCY OF

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.647
THOSE REVENUES AND WHAT THOSE

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.215
SERVICES ARE DOING TO SUPPORT

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:22.018
THE SAFETY NET TODAY IS THE

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:23.386
DIALOGUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:24.888
AND LEGISLATURE NEED TO HAVE

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.189
WHICH IS ARE THE SERVICES THAT

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:27.757
WE COLLECTIVELY AGREE NEED TO BE

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.325
PROVIDED AND IF SO.

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:31.061
THEN THERE'S A AN APPROPRIATION

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:32.495
IN A FUNDING MECHANISM TO

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:33.630
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RIGHT NOW WHAT

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.832
WE'RE SEEN AS A AS A DEPARTMENT

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:36.966
IS WE DON'T KNOW EITHER IT RIGHT

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.469
IT'S IT'S ANECDOTAL AND SO WE

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:41.304
REMAIN OPEN TO SEEING WHAT THAT

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:42.939
DATA IS AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.107
ARE WITH THOSE REVENUES.

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:45.375
BEING GENERATED AND OBVIOUSLY IT

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:47.077
WOULD BE A A JOINT DECISION

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:47.977
BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:50.513
ADMINISTRATION AS TO WHETHER OR

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.081
NOT TO CONTINUE TO FUND THE

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:51.781
SERVICE.

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.349
AND AND MAYBE THE ONLY THING I

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:54.184
WOULD ADD IS THAT I THINK THERE

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.085
IS THAT A LITTLE MORE

00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:56.786
UNCERTAINTY HERE THAN THERE WAS

00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:59.055
IN UNDER LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL TO

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:01.091
REALLY ELIMINATE THE USE OF

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:01.758
THREE FORTY B..

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:03.193
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SAY THE

00:56:03.259 --> 00:56:04.994
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT FEE

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:06.362
FOR SERVICE PAYS AND WHAT

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:07.897
MANAGED CARE PLANS CURRENTLY PAY

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:10.533
FOR A GIVEN THREE FORTY B. DRUG --

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.837
WHEREAS I THINK THAT THE SORT OF

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:16.106
AND SO HOW MUCH OF A HIT SAY AT

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:17.273
THREE FORTY BE COVERED ENTITY IS

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.808
TAKING IS UNCERTAIN AT LEAST AT

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.777
THIS POINT UNTIL WE SEE A FISCAL

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:24.147
ESTIMATE -- SO THERE COULD IT IT

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.615
IT JUST IS THERE IS THERE JUST

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.517
IS UNCERTAINTY HERE AS TO ITS

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:28.852
ULTIMATE MAGNITUDE AND I

00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:30.553
REMEMBER DISCUSSION CORRECTLY

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.589
LAST YEAR THE PROBLEM WAS THAT

00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:36.259
YES THE STATE SAVES MONEY.

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.160
BUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:39.028
GETS TAKEN AWAY SO THE MATH

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.196
MINUS THE STATE SAVES IS

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.599
ACTUALLY LESS ABOUT HALF.

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:45.201
OF WHAT THE ENTITIES ESSENTIALLY.

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:47.170
ADD SO WHICH MEANS OF THAT

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.738
ACTUALLY WE'VE JUST.

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:50.573
CHOPPED IN HALF THAT WE NOT ONLY

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.541
DO WE HAVE.

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:52.742
TO TAKE THE STOCK QUOTE SAVINGS

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:53.743
WE GOT AND FINALLY THE CHANNEL

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.211
BACK WE'VE GOT TO FIND MORE EVEN

00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:57.480
MORE MONEY.

00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:59.215
OTHERWISE IT'S STILL A CUTS.

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:00.917
THE YEAH THE ONLY THING I MIGHT.

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:03.453
ADD TO THAT IS -- THE IF TO THE

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.488
EXTENT THAT WE DID THAT REINVEST

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:06.990
THIS THE SAVINGS THAT WE DID GET

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:08.324
WE WOULD ALSO GET THE FEDERAL

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:10.460
MATCH THERE AS WELL SO IT WOULD

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:12.162
BE YOU KNOW DOUBLE THE YOU KNOW

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:13.463
THAT WHATEVER WE SAID THE

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.932
SAVINGS THAT WE GOT AND WE SAY.

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.634
EXPANDED COVERAGE OR PROVIDED A

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.602
TARGETED RATE INCREASE WHERE WE

00:57:19.669 --> 00:57:21.337
FIND AN ACCESS ISSUE WE WOULD

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:23.640
ALSO BE SORT OF LEVERAGING

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:26.609
FEDERAL FUNDS THERE AS WELL --

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:31.214
DATA YOU SAID THAT -- LET'S SAY --

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.883
THE ADMINISTRATION MAY FEEL IT'S

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.852
THEY CAN DO THIS WITHOUT.

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:37.754
MUCH.

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:38.988
BUT AS THE AYE AYES CERTAINLY

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:40.023
TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES I THINK

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:41.324
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE VERY

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:44.194
VERY VERY VERY VERY INVOLVED IN

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.495
THIS.

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:49.899
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE -- VERY.

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:50.967
AT THAT EIGHT OF THE

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.035
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IS DONE

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:54.270
WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:56.372
APPROVAL.

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:57.207
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:58.808
CONSEQUENCES THAT I'M HEARING

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:01.010
RIGHT NOW.

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.412
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:03.146
HIGH.

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:05.381
WHAT THIS IS THE SITE?

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:06.583
AND CERTAINLY LOOK FOR THE

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.651
ESTIMATE BUT THIS IS ANY WHAT

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:09.352
PEOPLE WERE THINKING WHEN WE

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:10.587
HEARD AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS THAT

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:11.788
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.156
LEVERAGE.

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:15.625
OUR PURCHASING POWER TO LOWER

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.160
OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:18.995
PEOPLE AND WHILE PEOPLE SAID

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:20.263
WELL WHAT'S GONNA HAVE A THREE

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.164
FORTY BEATER NOT THINKING LIKE

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:22.866
WELL THAT'S FOR MRS SAVINGS ARE

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.000
GOING TO BE COMING FROM IT AT

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:25.268
ALL SUPPOSED TO COME FROM.

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:28.271
MAGGOTS ARE PURCHASING POWER --

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:29.939
AND ACTED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:32.108
WELL SO WHAT OUR FORMULARY

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.276
HAVING A LEVERAGE THAT BUT OUR

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.345
HEARING LIKE WELL NOT SO MUCH

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.313
WE'LL FIND ON THE ESTIMATE.

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.082
BUT I THINK -- THERE'S AND

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:41.417
CERTAINLY THINK CERTAINLY I'VE

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:42.485
HER HEARD FROM ME MY COLLEAGUES

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:43.519
I THINK TO BE SIGNIFICANT

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:44.821
CONCERN.

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.256
IF THE THIS BASICALLY

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:48.057
ESSENTIALLY BECOMES A PROPOSAL

00:58:48.124 --> 00:58:52.762
PRIMARILY TO ELIMINATE THREE

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:54.430
FORTY BE.

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:54.931
I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:59.202
TREMENDOUS CONCERN.

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.403
WE LOOK FOR THIS SORT OF

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.305
ANALYZING THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:03.640
FISCAL ESTIMATE TO SEE THE

00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:05.408
EXTENT TO WHICH THREE FORTY B.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:06.843
IS REALLY A SORT OF PRIMARY

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.444
GENERATOR OF THE SAVINGS --

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:10.013
VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER SORT OF

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.648
TRANSFERS OF I OR SOME OF THE

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:13.783
OTHER SAVINGS OPPORTUNITY SO

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:15.852
STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY HERE.

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.320
OKAY.

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:17.987
ALL RIGHT AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THE

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.756
PUBLIC HAS ANY COMMENT ABOUT

00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:23.593

CONVERSATIONS THE MANAGED CARE

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:30.500
PLANS ABOUT -- A MEDIC YO BUT

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:33.336
DON'T LET AND I RELATED TO TALK

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:34.938
WITH VALUE BASED PURCHASING BUT

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:35.939
OBVIOUSLY -- MEDICATION

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.240
TREATMENT IS SERVE A COMPONENT

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:40.243
IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.178
AND SO THE WAY WE CALL CARVE IT

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.113
OUT AND IS A SEPARATE THING IN

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.449
TERMS OF FOR DOING VALLEY'S

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:47.016
PURCHASING ARE THE TYPES OF

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:47.550
THINGS.

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:48.885
WE GOT THINK ABOUT HOW THAT ALL

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.353
KIND OF COMES BACK TOGETHER

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.221
BECAUSE IT'S FOR APPLE SOMETIMES

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:53.990
WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:56.159
IMPROVE -- QUALITY AND REDUCE

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:57.760
COSTS IS ACTUALLY.

00:59:57.827 --> 00:59:59.562
TO INCREASE MEDICATION.

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.464
ADHERENCE AND THEREFORE

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.467
UTILIZATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.401
MEDICATIONS FRAMPOL ASTHMA TRY

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.703
TO GET MORE PEOPLE ON CONTROLLER

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.271
MEDICATIONS SO FORTH AND AND BUT

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.572
THAT SAVINGS COMES FROM

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.474
REDUCTION AND UTILIZATION THINGS

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.742
LIKE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.177
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SO FORTH

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.846
SELF MEDICATIONS CARVED OUT.

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:20.283
HOW DOES THAT WORK RIGHT BECAUSE

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.384
NOW YOU HAVE [inaudible]

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.285
THAT.

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:22.952
THAT THAT ART OF THE FUNDING IS

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:25.722
SEPARATED FROM.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:26.322
THE OTHER PIECE AND SO HOW DO

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:26.889

TOGETHER AS OUR AS WE TRY TO

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.208

FIFTY TWO HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:59.481

REQUIRES A STANDARD SET OF

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:21.670
PROJECTS AND METRICS.

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:22.671

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:25.073
ADDITIONAL ONES THAT THAT THE

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.875

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:10.185
ABOUT THAT TOO BUT IT'S TERM.

I I GUESS I'M TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:27.836
HOW TO CAPTURE LIKE WHAT

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:29.270
HAPPENED WITH THE WAIVER RIGHT

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:30.839
AND AND AND AND AND AND HOW DO

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:32.107
WE MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.341
AT LEAST TO BE PART OF THE

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.643
PURPOSE OF OF THESE PROGRAMS IS

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:37.145
THE SAY WELL WHAT WORKED WHAT.

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:39.013
DIDN'T WORK WHAT WE WANT TO

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.749
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH --

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.584
WHAT WE PITCH TO CMS THAT WE

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:45.987
WANT TO CONTINUE RIGHT -- I MEAN

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:46.921
IT SO I GUESS IT WILL MAYBE ALL

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.256
OF THEM BUT BUT I MEAN IT'S

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:50.091
HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO SAY LOOK

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.026
WE'VE GOTTEN SOME INFORMATION TO

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:52.660
SHOW THAT WE MADE A DIFFERENCE

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:53.495
SO.

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.796
HOW DO YOU SEE THAT ROLLING OUT

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.097
AND HOW AND HOW DO YOU SEE

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:57.699
REPORTING OUT TO YOU KNOW THE

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.734
LEGISLATURE AND OTHER PEOPLE

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:02.137
ABOUT WHAT THE?

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:03.872
RESULTS ARE LIKE QUITE.

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:05.106
BEYOND THEY'LL HAVE SOME GREAT

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:08.176
CASE STORIES AND SO FORTH BUT

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:09.511
EXACTLY WHAT.

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:10.245
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:11.579
SURE SO WE DO HAVE --IN MOST OF

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:15.316
THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE MID MID

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:17.218
EVALUATION OR HOWARD SO WE'VE

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.653
DONE SOME OF THOSE.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.554
I THINK WE HAVE ONE COMING UP

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:20.555
FROM ONE I'M SORRY I DON'T

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:21.623
REMEMBER THEM OFF THE TOP OF MY

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.625
HEAD WE ALSO DO QUARTERLY AND

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.660
ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE WAIVER TO

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:28.630
SEE A MASS -- AND SO WE ARE

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:30.098
ESSENTIALLY COMBING THROUGH THAT

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:31.833
INFORMATION AND LOOKING AT THE

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.802
OTHER DATA THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.136
EVEN IF THE EVALUATION ISN'T

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:36.504
DONE YET.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.573
AS A BASIS FOR HAVING THAT

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.375
CONVERSATION THAT WE THINK WILL

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:42.310
STAR IN THE FALL OF WHAT THINGS

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.679
WORKED AND SO HOW DO WE THEN I

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:45.814
THINK THE POINT YOU'VE MADE A

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.815
LOT LIKE HAVE IT NOT TO BE

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.550
PILOTS ANYMORE BUT REALLY HOW DO

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:49.884
WE IF SOMETHING'S WORKING HOW DO.

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.519
WE MAKE IT INTO THE MEDICAID

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:54.189
PROGRAM AS A WHOLE JUST CLARIFY

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:54.923
I MEAN THAT.

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:58.493
SOME PEOPLE SAY RIGHT WE I

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.228
SUBMIT REPORTS. TO THOSE REPORTS

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:01.029
ARE JUST LIKE WHAT WE SPEND THIS

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:02.497
MUCH MONEY AND WE DELIVERED EX

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.998
NUMBER SERVICES SO FORTH I MEAN

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:06.034
THAT'S BEEN A WE HAVE ACTUAL.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.302
VALUATION.

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:08.503
SO I THINK WHAT THEY MIGHT BE

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:09.337
HELPFUL IS.

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:11.973
THAT BIT OF A A BROADER TIMELINE

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.741
ON THE VALUATION THE KIND OF

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:15.710
RESULTS YES WE'RE GOING TO YET I

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.879
MEAN THE ON THE OUR REPORTING WE

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:18.680
SPENT.

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:21.516
HOWEVER MUCH MONEY OBVIOUSLY IS

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:22.150
BUDGET COMMITTEE AND CARE ABOUT

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.418
MONEY A LOT.

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.019
BUT ALSO I'M THINKING ABOUT THE

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:26.554
EMIGRATE AND AND ALSO RECOGNIZE

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.957
FOR EXAMPLE OKAY SO THE WAIVERS.

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:31.226
DONE WE HOPE THAT IT WILL

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:32.393
CONTINUES ON THESE PROGRAMS

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.262
CONTINUE IN A FUTURE WAIVER BUT

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.831
IS OR HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO.

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:38.299
YOU KNOW THE DEAD OR CAPTURED A

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:40.101
LAST YEAR RIGHT AND DEPENDING

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:42.170
HOW LONG IT TOOK TO RAMP UP AND

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.104
SO AND BY WE WILL HAVE TO RAMP

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:43.705
UP.

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.206
YEAH WE WANT YOU DON'T DOES NOT

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:47.408
THINK THINGS SO HAPPEN ONLY ONE

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.843
YEAR BUT THE OF MAY TAKE A FEW

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:50.144
YEARS BEFORE YOU SEE THE IMPACT.

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:53.348
IS THERE'RE SOME SORT OF PLANNED

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:55.049
FOR EVALUATION TO OR YOU KNOW

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.217
TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.820
CONCLUSION OF THIS WAIVER NOW OF

01:25:58.887 --> 01:25:59.521
THE THIRD LACKEY WEEKS WE'RE

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:00.922
STILL CONTINUE THE PROGRAM BUT

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.423
EVEN THE PROGRAM FOR SOME REASON

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.459
WAS NO LONGER FUNDED DUMMIES OR

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:04.659
SOME.

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:06.461
WAY TO LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:07.629
CONCLUSION OF THAT WAY FOR ALL

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:09.330
OF THE PROGRAMS ALSO REQUIRE

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:11.332

PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING SO ON

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.033
THE DENTAL SIDE WE WILL WE WOULD

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.768
HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO DO

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.703
IT -- THERE ARE OTHER

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:50.905

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:45.672
DON'T KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:47.040
A JOB LONGER THAN TWO MONTHS.

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:49.142
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WE CAN'T

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:50.510
SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION THE

01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:52.545
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:50:52.612 --> 01:50:53.279
ABLE TO TRANSITION WE'VE

01:50:53.346 --> 01:50:55.548
TRANSITIONED OVER THIRTY FIVE

01:50:55.615 --> 01:50:56.416
HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:57.951
OTHERWISE WOULD BE STRANDED

01:50:58.018 --> 01:50:59.285
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:01.121
INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS.

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:03.123
AND THESE ARE COMPLICATED VERY

01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:04.591
DETAILED TIME INTENSIVE

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:06.960
TRANSITIONS THAT WE CANNOT

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:08.461
COMPLETE IN THE TIMELINE

01:51:08.528 --> 01:51:09.863
NECESSARY UNLESS WE HAVE A

01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:11.998
STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR HOPE

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:13.433
WE OPTIMISTIC THE FEDS WILL GIVE

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.768
A LONGER EXTENSION.

01:51:14.834 --> 01:51:17.270
BUT WE CAN'T JUST KEEP BEING IN

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:18.872
THIS LIMBO PHASE THE DEPARTMENT

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:21.307
CAN'T GIVE US A LOT OF ADVICE

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:23.076
ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED UNLESS WE

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:25.745
HAVE SOME STABLE FUNDING SO WE

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:31.051

01:51:32.419 --> 01:51:34.287
THE OTHER BIG ISSUE IS WE CAN'T

EXACTLY WHAT THE REQUEST IS.

01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.035
SENATOR PENN LAST YEAR WE CAME

01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:57.237
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT TO

01:52:57.303 --> 01:52:57.737
MAKE IT.

01:52:57.804 --> 01:52:59.205
PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL REQUEST

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:01.141
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WAS

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:01.774
SCHEDULED TO END AT THE FEDERAL

01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:02.742
LEVEL.

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:05.078

01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:08.047
FEDERAL MONEY.

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:10.150
THERE WAS TREMENDOUS DISRUPTION

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:13.052
IN THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:15.955
THE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE DATE

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:17.056

SUBSEQUENT TEMPORARY EXTENSIONS

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:21.094
AND THIS DEMONSTRATES THE VITAL

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:23.329
REASON. FOR THE STATE PUTTING UP

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:25.165
THAT MONEY TO SAY WOW WILL

01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:27.100

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.735
SUPPORT IN CONGRESS.

01:53:28.801 --> 01:53:29.602
IF THEY CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:31.437
THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.573
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:34.607
PROGRAM STOP AND IT SAVES MONEY.

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:37.076
AND THIS THIS IS FOR ONE YEAR --

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:39.512
THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU WOULD BE

TO ENSHRINE IT IN LAW I'M TO

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:42.682
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ONE YEAR BUT

01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:45.418
WE DO HAVE A POLICY BILL SB TWO

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:47.086
FOURTEEN DODD. FOR THE SENATE

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:49.989
PROGRAM CLARIFIED AND THIS IS A

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:51.558
REQUEST FOR ONE YEAR FUNDING.

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:52.559
IN THE EVENT THAT THE FEDERAL

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:54.794
GOVERNMENT.

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:56.362
DOESN'T COME THROUGH OUR HOUSING

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:58.131
GAP OR SOMETHING SO WE COULD

01:53:58.198 --> 01:53:59.566
BASICALLY AT LEAST DEAR THAT

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:00.900
THAT THE NONPROFITS WHO ARE

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:02.502
DOING THIS TO HAVE THEIR

01:54:02.569 --> 01:54:04.537
EMPLOYEES TO LOOK.

01:54:04.604 --> 01:54:06.072
YOU KNOW YOU WILL DEFINITELY

01:54:06.139 --> 01:54:08.474
HAVE A JOB FOR THE NEXT YEAR

01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:09.809
BECAUSE THE MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

01:54:09.876 --> 01:54:11.811
THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH THIS

01:54:11.878 --> 01:54:12.712
WILL BE A FUNDED.

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:13.947
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY SO WE CAN

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:15.615
SUCCESSFULLY CONTINUE TO

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:17.550
TRANSITION PEOPLE THE PROBLEM IS

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:19.052
WE WERE IN A POSITION WHERE

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:21.487
PEOPLE HAD TO STOP STOP OKAY.

01:54:21.554 --> 01:54:22.188
ALL RIGHT.

01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:25.391
OKAY IT BY ANY FROM TEACHERS

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:26.859
RESPECTIVE I MEAN WELL I MEAN I

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.127
THINK WE ARE WE HAVE COMMITTED

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:29.596
AGAIN THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT

01:54:29.662 --> 01:54:31.164
CONVERSATION IN THE ASSEMBLY ON

01:54:31.231 --> 01:54:31.864
MONDAY.

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:33.533
AND SO IN ADDITION TO SOME OF

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.734
THE OTHER ISSUES WE DID ALSO

01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:36.069
COMMIT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:39.339
FINANCE ON HELPING TO UNDERSTAND

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:41.374
WHAT THE FISCAL RESULT IS IF ALL

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:42.342
THE FEDERAL MONEY IS GONE AND

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:43.509
IT'S ALL STATE FUNDING.

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:45.712
WHAT IS THE SAVINGS IF THERE IS

01:54:45.778 --> 01:54:47.013
SAVINGS JUST SO THAT THAT CAN BE

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.748
A PART OF THE DECISION MAKING SO

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:49.682
WE ARE WORKING ON THAT?

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:52.018
OKAY M. TO EXPLAIN THE LOG JAM

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:53.987
BECAUSE WE THINK THERE ARE SLOTS

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:54.654
AVAILABLE THEY'RE JUST NOT BEING

01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:56.522
FILLED OKAY AND THERE'S A VERY

01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:58.524
LONG LIKE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED

01:54:58.591 --> 01:54:59.125
PERSON WAITING LIST.

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:03.296
OKAY AND AND THIS IS.

01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:05.598
IN A SU MOST OF THESE PEOPLE IN

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:06.633
THE NURSING HOMES AT THEM TO BE

01:55:06.699 --> 01:55:08.568
A MEDICAL.

01:55:08.635 --> 01:55:10.937
SO IN GENERAL YES MOST PEOPLE IN

01:55:11.004 --> 01:55:12.105
HER SING SILLY IS RIGHT YEAH I

01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:14.007
THINK IT'S 80% -- IF WE ACTUALLY

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.675
GOT ABOUT NURSING HOMES ENTER

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:17.410
HOMES WOULD SAVE SOME MONEY TO

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:19.145
WRITE YES AND THAT IS THE BASIS

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:20.546
WHY WE HAVE THESE WEAVERS I

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:22.482
THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE OF HOW DO

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:23.816
YOU DO THAT OR IS THAT.

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:25.084
WHAT ARE THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:26.419
ARE WE DOING IT APPROPRIATELY SO

01:55:26.486 --> 01:55:27.920
THAT IS OUR GOAL AS WELL FOR

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.023
SURE -- AND AGAIN I THINK A YOU

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:31.624
KNOW AS AS WE COMMITTED TO COME

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:33.493
BACK -- IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS ON

01:55:33.559 --> 01:55:34.927
SORT OF SOME OF THE PARTICULAR

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:36.496
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT

01:55:36.562 --> 01:55:37.964
PARTICULAR ON CHILDREN OR OTHERS.

01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:39.098
THAT WE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:55:39.165 --> 01:55:41.234
ADDRESS BUT YES WE WE ARE A 100%

01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:42.468
AND ON HOME COMMUNITY BASED

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:43.569
SERVICES WE JUST.

01:55:43.636 --> 01:55:44.370
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:45.305
IT RIGHT THERE'S ALSO

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:46.906
UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU ARE VERY

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:48.007
FAMILIAR WITH THERE'S LOTS OF

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:49.042
VERY SPECIFIC FEDERAL

01:55:49.108 --> 01:55:50.443
REQUIREMENTS.

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:52.211
THAT ALSO TAKE TIME THAT YOU

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:53.513
KNOW I THINK WE WOULD ALL LIKE

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:54.347
THINGS.

01:55:54.414 --> 01:55:55.415
TO MAGICALLY BE EASIER BUT

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:56.783
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS BUT WE THAT

01:55:56.849 --> 01:55:57.950
WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO

01:55:58.017 --> 01:55:58.885
FIGURE OUT.

01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:00.520
HOW TO IMPROVE WHAT'S GOING ON

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:01.587
RIGHT BUT AT A AT THE ON THE

01:56:01.654 --> 01:56:04.057
BUDGETARY STANDPOINT SO I

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:05.825
UNDERSTAND LIKE OKAY IF THE FED

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:06.092
DOESN'T?

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:07.927
AT ALL BUT PRICE SOME KIND OF A

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:09.929
FINANCIAL I DON'T CARE TO USE

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:13.399
RIGHT WORD BUT BUT IT IS BY WAY

01:56:13.466 --> 01:56:14.167
OF IT TURNS OUT WERE FUNDING IT

01:56:14.233 --> 01:56:15.735
WE CAN CHANGES WE CAN MAKE THE

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:22.608
RULES LAW HE'S HEARD IT'S OUR

01:56:22.675 --> 01:56:22.809
MONEY.

01:56:22.875 --> 01:56:23.643
YES.

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:24.577
BUT I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING

01:56:24.644 --> 01:56:24.977
ABOUT.

01:56:25.044 --> 01:56:26.212
THIS IS A PROGRAM TO GET PEOPLE

01:56:26.279 --> 01:56:27.213
OUT OF NURSING HOMES INTO THEIR

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:27.647
HOMES.

01:56:27.714 --> 01:56:29.115
THAT'S SAVING US MONEY.

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:30.116
SO WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS IT

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:31.250
SAVED US MONEY BUT BECAUSE WE

01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:32.952
HAD ALL FEDERAL MONEY FOR THEIR

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:34.754
PART -- YEAH I THINK THAT'S

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:35.555
WHERE DOES THAT'S THE AMOUNT

01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:37.056
THAT WE LOOK AT NINE SO JUST TO

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:38.591
MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND

01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:40.326
WHAT IT IS IN THE CONTEXT OF IF

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:41.361
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DESN'T

IN BECAUSE THE MANAGED CARE

02:39:01.331 --> 02:39:02.566
PLANS.

02:39:02.633 --> 02:39:04.001
ARE IN THE POSITION OF

02:39:04.067 --> 02:39:05.636
NEGOTIATING WITH PROVIDERS ABOUT

02:39:05.702 --> 02:39:07.471
WHAT THOSE RATES COULD BE -- WE

02:39:07.537 --> 02:39:09.539
DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY WHAT THE

02:39:09.606 --> 02:39:11.475
RATES ARE GETTING TO AFTER THE

02:39:11.541 --> 02:39:13.210
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ARE MADE

02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:15.212
AND THIS MEANS THAT WE MAY NOT

02:39:15.279 --> 02:39:16.380
BE TARGETING.

02:39:16.446 --> 02:39:18.148
THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:19.549
PLACES WHERE THEY ARE MOST

02:39:19.616 --> 02:39:21.351
NEEDED SINCE MANAGED CARE PLANS

02:39:21.418 --> 02:39:21.952
COULD ALREADY BE MAKING

02:39:22.019 --> 02:39:25.222
ADJUSTMENTS -- IN SOME CASES TO

02:39:25.289 --> 02:39:26.957
TO TRY AND INCREASE THE ACCESS.

02:39:27.024 --> 02:39:29.192
IN LIGHT OF THAT -- WE THINK

02:39:29.259 --> 02:39:30.360
IT'S CRITICAL AS A AND THE

02:39:30.427 --> 02:39:31.762
DEPARTMENT HAS MENTIONED THAT.

02:39:31.828 --> 02:39:34.298
THIS BE EVALUATED TO ENSURE THAT

02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:37.634
IT'S THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY --

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:39.102
TO GUARANTEE THE LEVEL OF ACCESS

02:39:39.169 --> 02:39:40.804
IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT THE

02:39:40.871 --> 02:39:42.572
LEGISLATURE ONCE.

02:39:42.639 --> 02:39:44.408
AND WE ALSO NOTE THAT AND THERE

02:39:44.474 --> 02:39:45.943
ARE OTHER.

02:39:46.009 --> 02:39:48.045
WAYS TO GET AT ENSURING THAT

02:39:48.111 --> 02:39:49.379
THERE'S ACCESS IN THE PROGRAM A

02:39:49.446 --> 02:39:50.147
ONE OF THOSE.

02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:52.215
IS THROUGH COMPLIANCE AND

02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:53.784
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH

02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:55.118
MANAGED CARE PLANS.

02:39:55.185 --> 02:39:57.254
AND ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT THAT

02:39:57.321 --> 02:39:57.888
WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE

02:39:57.955 --> 02:40:00.190
AGENDA IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:03.193
PROPOSAL WITH -- REGARD -- TO

02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:03.694
STRENGTHENING PREVENTIVE

02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:06.296
SERVICES FOR CHILDREN IN IN THE

02:40:06.363 --> 02:40:07.731
MEDICARE PROGRAM -- THIS HAS THE

02:40:07.798 --> 02:40:09.266
POTENTIAL TO BE A COST EFFECTIVE

02:40:09.333 --> 02:40:14.071
WAY TO IMPROVE ACCESS -- AS IT --

02:40:14.137 --> 02:40:18.375
FOCUS ON HELPING THEM.

02:40:18.442 --> 02:40:18.976
ENSURING THE MEASURE PLANS ARE

02:40:19.042 --> 02:40:19.509
MEETING THEIR CONTRACTUAL

02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:20.177
REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT. TO TO

02:40:20.243 --> 02:40:23.013
ACCESS [inaudible]

02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:24.081
FINANCE [inaudible]

02:40:24.147 --> 02:40:27.818
COMMENTS. EIGHT SO FOR A FIRST

02:40:27.884 --> 02:40:31.388
OF ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT --

02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:32.389
STATE THAT IT WILL TAKE SOME

02:40:32.456 --> 02:40:32.923
TIME TO SEE RESULTS RIGHT

02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:34.291
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT

02:40:34.358 --> 02:40:35.225
YOU MAKE THE CHANGE PEOPLE TO

02:40:35.292 --> 02:40:36.259
KNOW THE CHANGES HAPPENED SO

02:40:36.326 --> 02:40:38.362
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

02:40:38.428 --> 02:40:39.062
AND THEN TAKE SOME TIME TO

02:40:39.129 --> 02:40:40.864
MEASURE IT AND THEN REPORTED OUT

02:40:40.931 --> 02:40:43.266
SO -- I APPRECIATE RECOGNITION

02:40:43.333 --> 02:40:44.334
OF ACTUALLY HAVING SOME

02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:46.703
CONSISTENCY SO THAT PEOPLE WILL

02:40:46.770 --> 02:40:48.005
ACTUALLY CONSIDER BEHAVIOR

02:40:48.071 --> 02:40:50.073
CHANGE AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY --

02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:51.842
WHAT'S.

02:40:51.908 --> 02:40:52.809
MATTERS IN TERMS OF ON THE END

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:54.378
SO WE WANT MORE PEOPLE WILLING

02:40:54.444 --> 02:40:58.949
TO ACCEPT MEDI CAL PATIENTS -- I

02:40:59.016 --> 02:41:00.817
APPRECIATE -- THE ALLEY AS

02:41:00.884 --> 02:41:05.722
COMMENTS -- AGAIN I GUESS WHAT I

02:41:05.789 --> 02:41:08.392
SAY IS THAT -- CERTAINLY TIME

02:41:08.458 --> 02:41:11.128
AND DISTANCE AND WE USE THAT FOR

02:41:11.194 --> 02:41:14.064
IN IN -- AND OUR COMMERCIAL SIDE

02:41:14.131 --> 02:41:18.702
AS WELL -- HIDE THIS IT'S A

02:41:18.769 --> 02:41:19.703
BETTER FOR STILL FAIRLY NARROW

02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:23.774
WAY OF LOOKING AT AT ACCESS IN

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:25.609
THE FACT.

02:41:25.675 --> 02:41:26.276
I THINK THE STANDARDS ONLY APPLY

02:41:26.343 --> 02:41:28.245
TO CERTAIN SPECIALTY IS CERTAIN

02:41:28.311 --> 02:41:30.881
TYPES OF SERVICES SO -- SO I

02:41:30.947 --> 02:41:32.049
THINK THAT AND ONE WITH A LOOK

02:41:32.115 --> 02:41:34.951
AT OTHER MEDICAID PROGRAMS I

02:41:35.018 --> 02:41:37.254
MEAN I I I I I IT IN WHAT WERE

02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:37.521
YOU HERE.

02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:39.322
FOR FREQUENTLY BUT I ALSO SEE

02:41:39.389 --> 02:41:41.658
PEOPLE GETTING BACKED UP TRYING --

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:42.926
TO THOSE WEEDS OUT NO WE CAN

02:41:42.993 --> 02:41:45.395
BRACE MEDI CAL EXPANSION

02:41:45.462 --> 02:41:46.563
MEDICAID EXPANSION SO FORTH I

02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:48.298
KNOW WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH

02:41:48.365 --> 02:41:50.767
THIS ISSUE OF OF PEOPLE BUT BE

02:41:50.834 --> 02:41:52.669
ABLE TO GET IN -- AND WHILE

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:54.237
CERTAINLY US SOME MANAGED CARE

02:41:54.304 --> 02:41:56.106
PLANS HAVE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:57.174
VERTICALLY FOR SPECIALTY CARE

02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:00.877
WHICH HAS BEEN.

02:42:00.944 --> 02:42:04.147
THOSE PROBLEMATIC.

02:42:04.214 --> 02:42:06.083
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE --

02:42:06.149 --> 02:42:08.985
THERE'S ALSO CHALLENGES SO -- SO

02:42:09.052 --> 02:42:10.987
IS SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE

02:42:11.054 --> 02:42:12.389
CERTAINLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO TO

02:42:12.456 --> 02:42:13.623
EVALUATE THAT AND ALSO LOOK AT

02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:15.759
THE FULL RANGE OF THE ACCESS

02:42:15.826 --> 02:42:16.760
SERVICES WHICH ACTUALLY FRANKLY

02:42:16.827 --> 02:42:18.528
IS -- THE BIGGER CHALLENGES ON

02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:19.796
THE SPECIALTY SIDE.

02:42:19.863 --> 02:42:21.932
NOW RECOGNIZING THE REASON ON

02:42:21.998 --> 02:42:22.766
THE PRIMARY CARE SIDE WE TEND TO

02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:27.704
HAVE A LITTLE LESS IS BECAUSE OF

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:30.340
OUR FQHCS AND ARE AT AND LOOK

02:42:30.407 --> 02:42:31.108
LOOK LIKES AND SO FORTH AND IN

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:32.509
SOME SENSES -- AND THEY GET

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:37.581
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES SO -- SO FOR

02:42:37.647 --> 02:42:38.515
EXAMPLE WITH THE LOWEST

02:42:38.582 --> 02:42:39.783
DISSIPATION RATE OF PRIVATE

02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:40.484
PRACTICE PEDIATRICIANS.

02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:42.385
IN OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM OF ANY

02:42:42.452 --> 02:42:43.987
STATE.

02:42:44.054 --> 02:42:45.989
SO THE QUESTION IS IS THAT IS

02:42:46.056 --> 02:42:47.290
THAT A PROBLEM OR NOT WELL YOU

02:42:47.357 --> 02:42:48.558
KNOW IF WE CAN GET INTO A

02:42:48.625 --> 02:42:51.261
DIFFERENT ONE RIGHT TO GET TO A

02:42:51.328 --> 02:42:51.495
CLINIC.

02:42:51.561 --> 02:42:54.598
BUT ARE A LARGE NUMBER CAN IT

02:42:54.664 --> 02:42:56.666
THERE IN URBAN AREAS FINE OF

02:42:56.733 --> 02:42:58.535
CLINICS AROUND BUT THE STAT IS

02:42:58.602 --> 02:42:59.603
THAT GOOD ENOUGH.

02:42:59.669 --> 02:43:00.504
FOR MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES OTHER

02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:01.671
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE MORE

02:43:01.738 --> 02:43:03.373
DISPERSED AND WHILE THEY'RE

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:05.442
CERTAINLY VERY EXCELLENT.

02:43:05.509 --> 02:43:06.176
COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTERS RURAL

02:43:06.243 --> 02:43:07.010
HEALTH CENTERS.

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:08.211
SOME OF THE MORE CHALLENGING

02:43:08.278 --> 02:43:10.180
WHEN THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO

02:43:10.247 --> 02:43:13.083
PHYSICIANS -- ISN'T

02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:17.454
PARTICIPATING NOW BUT TO MY

02:43:17.521 --> 02:43:19.489
COMMENT.

02:43:19.556 --> 02:43:20.824
YEAH THE ONLY THING I MIGHT ADD

02:43:20.891 --> 02:43:22.325
IS THAT WE DO WE DO REALLY AGREE

02:43:22.392 --> 02:43:23.760
THAT THERE IS -- WHILE BROADER

02:43:23.827 --> 02:43:24.594
CONSTELLATION OF ACCESS OR

02:43:24.661 --> 02:43:25.595
QUALITY MEASURES THAT REALLY

02:43:25.662 --> 02:43:27.898
MATTER FOR HOW WELL THE MEDI CAL

02:43:27.964 --> 02:43:29.432
PROGRAM IS A IS SUCCEEDING AND

02:43:29.499 --> 02:43:30.600
SO FORTH AND THAT THAT IS WHY WE

02:43:30.667 --> 02:43:31.668
DO THINK THE APPROACH THAT WE

02:43:31.735 --> 02:43:33.203
WILL DISCUSS AT THE END OF THE

02:43:33.270 --> 02:43:33.570
DH CS AGENDA.

02:43:33.637 --> 02:43:35.105
IN TERMS OF INCREASING THE

02:43:35.172 --> 02:43:37.841
NUMBER OF HE THIS MEASURES THAT --

02:43:37.908 --> 02:43:40.410
PLANS ARE -- HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:41.845
TO FULLY UTILIZING THE SURVEYS

02:43:41.912 --> 02:43:42.746
OF BENEFICIARY SATISFACTION AND

02:43:42.812 --> 02:43:44.648
SO FORTH AND SO WE REALLY DO --

02:43:44.714 --> 02:43:45.649
WE DO REALLY DO THINK THAT THAT

02:43:45.715 --> 02:43:47.083
LOOKING AT ENFORCEMENT AND

02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:48.351
ACCOUNTABILITY TO A LOT OF THESE

02:43:48.418 --> 02:43:49.085
OUTCOMES MEASURE DOES HOLD

02:43:49.152 --> 02:43:53.823
PROMISE IN TERMS OF INCREASING

02:43:53.890 --> 02:43:56.092
QUALITY AND ACCESS.

02:43:56.159 --> 02:43:58.828
AND THE SONY SIKORA PROVEN HE

02:43:58.895 --> 02:44:01.698
THIS IS GREAT -- BUT IT'S THE

02:44:01.765 --> 02:44:03.300
MYSTERY OF DATA AND IT'S USUALLY

02:44:03.366 --> 02:44:05.669
ON FAIRLY CALM CONDITIONS SO IF

02:44:05.735 --> 02:44:06.303
YOU HAVE RARE CONDITIONS THERE'S

02:44:06.369 --> 02:44:08.138
USUALLY NOT A HE THIS MEASURE

02:44:08.205 --> 02:44:09.940
BECAUSE IT'S MORE EPISODIC.

02:44:10.006 --> 02:44:11.274
WE DO CAPS I APPRECIATE THE

02:44:11.341 --> 02:44:11.975
REMOVING THE CAPS EVERY.

02:44:12.042 --> 02:44:14.978
YEAR BUT SO FAR WE HAVEN'T DONE

02:44:15.045 --> 02:44:21.618
VERY WELL ON CAP SO WHAT --

02:44:21.685 --> 02:44:23.220
EVERY OTHER YEAR OKAY THIS IS A

02:44:23.286 --> 02:44:23.853
VERY THREE YEARS EVERY TWO YEARS

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:25.422
SO -- BUT FRANKLY YOU KNOW IF

02:44:25.488 --> 02:44:26.623
YOU LOOK AT COMMERCIAL PLANS

02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:28.491
STIR GENTLY FOR FIVE STARS IF WE

02:44:28.558 --> 02:44:29.993
HAVE A THREE STAR MEDI CAL PLAN

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:31.394
THAT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY WELL

02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:33.263
I KNOW WE HAVE SOME CARDS ARE

02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:35.565
PLANS ARE UP AT FOUR FEIST I

02:44:35.632 --> 02:44:38.702
APPRECIATE THAT YES AND WE WE

02:44:38.768 --> 02:44:39.035
NEED TO TAKE.

02:44:39.102 --> 02:44:41.104
A LOOK AT THIS MEASURES.

02:44:41.171 --> 02:44:43.039
ALL RIGHT WELL WE DO HAVE --

02:44:43.106 --> 02:44:45.942
NUMEROUS -- STAKEHOLDER

02:44:46.009 --> 02:44:51.348
PROPOSALS DO WE HAVE HERE.

02:44:51.414 --> 02:44:55.118
LET'S SEE 1-234-567-8910 ELEVEN

02:44:55.185 --> 02:44:56.319

REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY

03:02:55.297 --> 03:02:56.065
CLINICAL LABORATORY SERVICES

03:02:56.131 --> 03:02:56.932
CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY

03:02:56.999 --> 03:02:59.101
ASSOCIATION AND ON THE BETTER

03:02:59.168 --> 03:03:00.669
CIRCLES THE DEVELOPMENTAL

03:03:00.736 --> 03:03:01.704
SERVICES NETWORK.

03:03:01.770 --> 03:03:03.372

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON

03:03:04.306 --> 03:03:05.307
CHRISTIE FOR A ON BEHALF OF THE

03:03:05.374 --> 03:03:06.742
CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY

03:03:06.809 --> 03:03:08.277
ASSOCIATION WE HAVE QUESTION LAP

03:03:08.344 --> 03:03:09.678
CORE THAT OUR MEMBERS.

03:03:09.745 --> 03:03:11.013
AND WE HAVE A BIT UNIQUE

03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:13.082
SITUATION WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A

03:03:13.148 --> 03:03:14.316
RATE INCREASE WE'RE JUST

03:03:14.383 --> 03:03:16.118
ACTUALLY ASKING THAT ARE MEDI

03:03:16.185 --> 03:03:17.720
CAL RATE BE LEFT THE SAME.

03:03:17.786 --> 03:03:18.887
AND NOT BE CUT BECAUSE IT'S

03:03:18.954 --> 03:03:19.955
SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING AT

03:03:20.022 --> 03:03:21.757
THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO HOW THAT

03:03:21.824 --> 03:03:22.858
WORKS AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:03:22.925 --> 03:03:25.294
IN CMS HAS MADE THE DECISION TO

03:03:25.361 --> 03:03:26.662
CHANGE THE WAY THEY CALCULATE.

03:03:26.729 --> 03:03:28.330
A MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

03:03:28.397 --> 03:03:29.898
FOR CLINICAL LABORATORIES SO

03:03:29.965 --> 03:03:31.266
THEY HAVE CUT ALL OF THE RATES

03:03:31.333 --> 03:03:33.969
DOWN TO THE NATIONAL MARKET RATE.

03:03:34.036 --> 03:03:34.903
AND THE REASON THIS IS AN ISSUE

03:03:34.970 --> 03:03:37.072
NOW IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING

03:03:37.139 --> 03:03:38.507
ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:03:38.574 --> 03:03:40.642
THAT'S BEEN HERE SINCE TWO

03:03:40.709 --> 03:03:41.543
THOUSAND THREE THAT SAYS UP OUR

03:03:41.610 --> 03:03:43.312
MEDICAL RATES CANNOT BE MORE

03:03:43.379 --> 03:03:46.448
THAN 80% OF THE MEDICARE RATE.

03:03:46.515 --> 03:03:48.851
AND SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOW

03:03:48.917 --> 03:03:50.452
THAT WE HAVE THESE NEW REDUCE TO

03:03:50.519 --> 03:03:52.154
MEDICARE RATES FOR THE FIRST

03:03:52.221 --> 03:03:53.155
TIME.

03:03:53.222 --> 03:03:55.090
THIS IMPACTS WHAT OUR RATES ARE

03:03:55.157 --> 03:03:56.725
FOR MEDI CAL AND I CAN GIVE YOU

03:03:56.792 --> 03:03:57.693
A QUICK EXAMPLE KINDA HELPS

03:03:57.760 --> 03:03:59.294
ILLUSTRATE THAT.

03:03:59.361 --> 03:04:00.429
SO AS A PART OF THE MEDI CAL

03:04:00.496 --> 03:04:01.797
PROGRAM WE DO CHILDHOOD LEAD

03:04:01.864 --> 03:04:03.932
BLOOD TESTING.

03:04:03.999 --> 03:04:04.900
AND SO AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN

03:04:04.967 --> 03:04:06.668
ME -- WHEN THEY TESTING ON A

03:04:06.735 --> 03:04:08.437
LEAD IN THE BLOOD IT'S THE SAME

03:04:08.504 --> 03:04:09.772
TEST FOR A CHILD AND MEDI CAL AS

03:04:09.838 --> 03:04:11.006
IT IS FOR AN ADULT IN THE

03:04:11.073 --> 03:04:12.207
MEDICARE PROGRAM?

03:04:12.274 --> 03:04:13.675
AND SO THE RECENT -- MEDICARE

03:04:13.742 --> 03:04:15.444
PRICE WAS SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND

03:04:15.511 --> 03:04:16.345
SIXTY ONE CENTS THE NEW

03:04:16.412 --> 03:04:17.713
CALCULATION THAT PUT IT UP

03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:19.882
MRKET RATE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO

03:04:19.948 --> 03:04:21.417
TEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS.

03:04:21.483 --> 03:04:24.286
SO IN CALIFORNIA BACK IN TWO

03:04:24.353 --> 03:04:26.722
pTO A MARKET RATE SO THE STATE

03:04:26.789 --> 03:04:27.756
FORTY COPULATE OUT THE MARKET

03:04:27.823 --> 03:04:29.525
RATE AND THE CURRENT MARKET RATE

03:04:29.591 --> 03:04:30.426
FOR THIS TEST.

03:04:30.492 --> 03:04:32.428
IS TEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE

03:04:32.494 --> 03:04:33.362
CENTS SO YOU CAN SEE IS VERY

03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:34.630
SIMILAR TO THAT MARKET RATE.

03:04:34.696 --> 03:04:36.932
THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS NEW

03:04:36.999 --> 03:04:37.900
PROVISION OUR WEBSITE WITH HIS

03:04:37.966 --> 03:04:40.002
OLD PROVISION IT WILL CAUSE THAT

03:04:40.068 --> 03:04:42.604
RATE TO BE CUT 20% DOWN TO EIGHT

03:04:42.671 --> 03:04:43.872
DOLLARS AND FORTY EIGHT CENTS.

03:04:43.939 --> 03:04:46.074
AND THEN WE STILL HAVE THE AB

03:04:46.141 --> 03:04:48.110
9710% CUT SO THAT BRINGS IT DOWN

03:04:48.177 --> 03:04:48.911
TO SEVEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE

03:04:48.977 --> 03:04:49.445
CENTS.

03:04:49.511 --> 03:04:50.679
SO IF YOU CAN SEE THE CURRENT

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:52.848
MEDI CAL RATE IS TEN DOLLARS AND

03:04:52.915 --> 03:04:54.483
THE NEW RATE WOULD BE UNDER

03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:55.551
SEVEN DOLLARS SO WE ABSOLUTELY

03:04:55.617 --> 03:04:56.985
THINK IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT

03:04:57.052 --> 03:04:58.720

NEED TO BE CUT 30%.

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:16.238
IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

03:05:16.305 --> 03:05:17.506
HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

03:05:17.573 --> 03:05:19.475

THIS IS THIS SO IN OTHER WORDS.

03:05:51.139 --> 03:05:52.007
IS IT FAIR TO JUST TAKE THE

03:15:54.709 --> 03:15:56.111
PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE INITIATIVE.

03:15:56.177 --> 03:15:58.246
AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW AND NEGOCIO

03:15:58.313 --> 03:16:00.014
THE GOVERNOR PUT THE SAN.

ADMIT THAT LEGALLY I HAD NO.

03:16:23.171 --> 03:16:25.273
ABILITY TO DO THIS IT'S AN

03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:26.774
INITIATIVE I MEAN WE ALLEN THINK

03:16:26.841 --> 03:16:28.409
THE LEGISLATURE COULD TRY TO

03:16:28.476 --> 03:16:33.548
PASS A BILL. TO TO FIX THAT SO --

03:16:33.615 --> 03:16:35.183
SO I WILL TELL YOU THAT I SHARE

03:16:35.250 --> 03:16:37.986
YEAR -- CONCERN I HAVE.

03:16:38.052 --> 03:16:39.554
MAN MADE THAT POINT POINTEDLY

03:16:39.621 --> 03:16:44.025
AND AT LEAST IN THE A AND

03:16:44.092 --> 03:16:45.293
SEVERAL OCCASIONS HERE -- BUT IN

03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:48.163
THE END -- AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE

03:16:48.229 --> 03:16:51.065
TO AND I WILL URGE AGAIN I HOPE

03:16:51.132 --> 03:16:54.202
THAT WITH THE HOSPITALS THAT --

03:16:54.269 --> 03:16:55.970
FINANCE LOOK AT THAT BUT SO

03:16:56.037 --> 03:16:56.704
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN MAY

03:16:56.771 --> 03:16:59.741
BU WHATEVER THEY DECIDE THAT WE

03:16:59.807 --> 03:17:00.708
HAVE.

03:17:00.775 --> 03:17:03.011
VERY LITTLE ABILITY TO CHANGE IT

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:03.978
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WAY

03:17:04.045 --> 03:17:06.381
THE INITIATIVE WAS WRITTEN SO.

03:17:06.447 --> 03:17:08.650
I WILL APPEAL ONCE AGAIN TO

03:17:08.716 --> 03:17:10.118
FINANCE TO HONOR WHAT I CONSIDER

03:17:10.185 --> 03:17:11.719
TO BE THE SPIRIT THE ACTUAL

03:17:11.786 --> 03:17:13.188
SPIRITS AND INTENTION OF THE

03:17:13.254 --> 03:17:15.056
VOTERS.

03:17:15.123 --> 03:17:16.691
AND I SAID PREVIOUSLY I WON'T.

03:17:16.758 --> 03:17:18.426
GO THROUGH ALL OF IT BUT THAT

03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:20.595
ARE.

03:17:20.662 --> 03:17:23.464
WHEN VOTERS -- PASS INITIATIVES --

03:17:23.531 --> 03:17:25.934
AND DAY -- AND WE DON'T UNDER

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:27.468
DURING TENSIONS WE CAN DOWN LIKE

03:17:27.535 --> 03:17:29.137
THE STRICT BUT LEGAL WE DON'T

03:17:29.204 --> 03:17:30.872
HONOR TENSIONS THAT UNDERMINES

03:17:30.939 --> 03:17:32.140
TRUST.

03:17:32.207 --> 03:17:33.174
BY THE VOTERS AND THEN WE HAVE

03:17:33.241 --> 03:17:34.742
TO GO BACK TO THEM AGAIN AND ASK

03:17:34.809 --> 03:17:36.945
THEM TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES

03:17:37.011 --> 03:17:38.012
FOR VERY IMPORTANT THINGS FOR

03:17:38.079 --> 03:17:39.414
THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA.

03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:41.816
THEY RIGHTFULLY BECOME A LITTLE

03:17:41.883 --> 03:17:42.483
LESS.

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:45.553
OPEN TO THOSE IDEAS BECAUSE

03:17:45.620 --> 03:17:48.122
THAT'S WHY I OFTEN HEAR SAY THAT

03:17:48.189 --> 03:17:49.857
ONE COMES INITIATIVE MONEY WE

03:17:49.924 --> 03:17:51.025
NEED TO SPEND IT THE WAY THE

03:17:51.092 --> 03:17:52.227
VOTERS INTENDED.

03:17:52.293 --> 03:17:53.728
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CAN KEEP

03:17:53.795 --> 03:17:55.230
GOING BACK TO THEM AND ASK THEM

03:17:55.296 --> 03:17:56.965
FOR HELP AGAIN AND WHEN THEY

03:17:57.031 --> 03:17:58.666
POINT TO THE FACT AND THE WE'D

03:17:58.733 --> 03:18:00.435
HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT'S NOT

03:18:00.501 --> 03:18:02.170
BEING DONE THE WAY THAT WAS

03:18:02.237 --> 03:18:03.538
PRESENTED TO THEM SO.

03:18:03.605 --> 03:18:05.273
NOW I'M REALIZE PART OF IT ALSO

03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:08.042
IS THE WAY WE WRITE THESE THINGS

03:18:08.109 --> 03:18:10.678
TO BUT SO I HOPE.

03:18:10.745 --> 03:18:12.480
BECAUSE OF WHILE I SAID THE WAY

03:18:12.547 --> 03:18:13.548
IS WRITTEN THE TORIES ENTIRELY

03:18:13.615 --> 03:18:14.649
IN THE HANDS OF THE PARK FINANCE.

03:18:14.716 --> 03:18:17.118
I HOPE THAT.

03:18:17.185 --> 03:18:20.922
THE GOVERNOR WHO IS THE BOSS --

03:18:20.989 --> 03:18:24.025
WILL -- THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT --

RESOURCES FOR RESTORING THOSE

03:22:26.501 --> 03:22:30.037
CUTS -- THEY WERE ABSENT FOR A

03:22:30.104 --> 03:22:32.607

THE MONEY -- SO -- THAT DOESN'T

03:22:57.899 --> 03:22:59.600

03:24:27.521 --> 03:24:28.689
BEGAN A COMPETITIVE BIDDING

03:24:28.756 --> 03:24:30.791
PROGRAM FOR DME A MOSTLY FOCUSED

03:24:30.858 --> 03:24:32.627
ON URBAN AREAS -- AND MUCH OF

03:24:32.693 --> 03:24:34.829
CALIFORNIA OF THOSE RATES

03:24:34.895 --> 03:24:36.697
GREATLY REDUCED THE ALLOWABLE

03:24:36.764 --> 03:24:38.065
UNDER MEDICARE SO.

03:24:38.132 --> 03:24:40.334
NOW WE'RE FACED WITH MEDI CAL

03:24:40.401 --> 03:24:42.370
THE BEGINNING TO USE THESE LOWER

03:24:42.436 --> 03:24:45.139
RATES EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST OF

03:24:45.206 --> 03:24:46.273
THIS YEAR.

03:24:46.340 --> 03:24:47.675
A SPA IT'S BEEN SUBMITTED --

03:24:47.742 --> 03:24:48.142
WOULD MAKE THOSE RATES

03:24:48.209 --> 03:24:49.977
RETROACTIVE ONCE A SPA IS

03:24:50.044 --> 03:24:51.979
APPROVED AND IT WOULD BE --

03:24:52.046 --> 03:24:53.314
THOSE MEDICARE RATES ARE RE

03:24:53.381 --> 03:24:55.049
BEING REDUCED FOR C. PAP FOR

03:24:55.116 --> 03:24:57.018
BEDS FOR SENATE WHEELCHAIRS BY

03:24:57.084 --> 03:24:57.952
4260%.

03:24:58.019 --> 03:25:00.054
MEDI CAL WOULD THEN TAKE 80% OF

03:25:00.121 --> 03:25:01.722
THAT AMOUNT AS THE PAYABLE. TO

03:25:01.789 --> 03:25:02.957
THE REDUCTIONS ARE MORE THAN

03:25:03.024 --> 03:25:04.225
MINOR THEY ARE A REALLY

03:25:04.291 --> 03:25:06.427
SIGNIFICANT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN --

03:25:06.494 --> 03:25:08.029
IMPACT IN THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY

03:25:08.095 --> 03:25:10.831
WITH ACCESS TO DME THERE WAS A

03:25:10.898 --> 03:25:13.968
LUCILLE PACKARD -- STUDY FOR CCS

03:25:14.035 --> 03:25:16.203
WHICH SHOW 37% OF PATIENTS HAD

03:25:16.270 --> 03:25:17.672
DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING OFFENDER.

03:25:17.738 --> 03:25:19.006
BECAUSE OF LOW REIMBURSEMENT

03:25:19.073 --> 03:25:20.508
BECAUSE OF UNWILLING TO PROVIDE

03:25:20.574 --> 03:25:22.376
CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AND

03:25:22.443 --> 03:25:23.811
LONG DELAYS IN GETTING ACCESS

03:25:23.878 --> 03:25:24.845
THE NUMBER PROVIDERS IN

03:25:24.912 --> 03:25:26.047
CALIFORNIA HAS GONE DOWN BUT FOR

03:25:26.113 --> 03:25:28.616
OVER 40% THE LAST EIGHTEEN

03:25:28.683 --> 03:25:29.216
MONTHS BECAUSE OF COMPETITIVE

03:25:29.283 --> 03:25:29.784
BIDDING.

03:25:29.850 --> 03:25:31.318
MEDICARE HAS NOW SLOW DOWN THE

03:25:31.385 --> 03:25:32.353
COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS

03:25:32.420 --> 03:25:34.121
DELAYED ANY NEW ROUNDS OF

03:25:34.188 --> 03:25:37.091
COMPETITIVE BIDDING UNTIL UNTIL

03:25:37.158 --> 03:25:37.658
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND

03:25:37.725 --> 03:25:38.726
CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS.

03:25:38.793 --> 03:25:40.294
SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT

03:25:40.361 --> 03:25:42.229
THAT MEDI CAL PROGRAM IS GOING

03:25:42.296 --> 03:25:44.098
TO HAVE TO SERIOUS ACCESS ISSUES.

03:25:44.165 --> 03:25:46.534
WITH ACCESS TO DM ME IF THESE

03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:47.301
RATES ARE IMPLEMENTED IN

03:25:47.368 --> 03:25:48.335
ADDITION PROVIDERS ARE TOTALLY

03:25:48.402 --> 03:25:49.603
UNAWARE THE WHAT THESE RATES ARE

03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:51.005
GOING TO BE THE PROVIDING

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:52.073
SERVICE RIGHT NOW UNDER FEE

03:25:52.139 --> 03:25:53.407
SCHEDULE IS PUBLISHED.

03:25:53.474 --> 03:25:55.076
THE CLUE IS GOING TO BE SO SLASH

03:25:55.142 --> 03:25:59.780
DRAMATICALLY -- ONCE THE SPAS

03:25:59.847 --> 03:26:02.216
APPROVED -- QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT

03:26:02.283 --> 03:26:03.884
VENTILATOR WE HEARD FROM EARLIER

03:26:03.951 --> 03:26:07.421
AND SUBACUTE THE VENTILATORS ARE --

03:26:07.488 --> 03:26:08.322
A PRODUCT THAT THAT FEW DE ME

03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.923
COMPANIES PROVIDE BECAUSE THE

03:26:08.989 --> 03:26:10.024
COMPLEXITY BECAUSE THE TWENTY

03:26:10.091 --> 03:26:11.859
FOUR SEVEN CARE. FOR RESPIRATORY

03:26:11.926 --> 03:26:13.394
THERAPY EXCEPT FOR A THAT RATE

03:26:13.461 --> 03:26:14.028
WAS REDUCED BECAUSE OF MEDICARE

03:26:14.095 --> 03:26:15.362
CHANGES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:16.464
FROM ELEVEN AND ALWAYS A MONTH

03:26:16.530 --> 03:26:17.164
LATER DOLLARS A MONTH.

03:26:17.231 --> 03:26:18.199
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT

03:26:18.265 --> 03:26:19.500
THE EQUIPMENT'S EXPENSIVE DOES

03:26:19.567 --> 03:26:20.935
NOT INCLUDE ALL THE SUPPLIES

03:26:21.001 --> 03:26:22.703
THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPLACED --

03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:23.938
THE BREEDING CIRCUITS THE TUBING

03:26:24.004 --> 03:26:25.606
ETCETERA THOSE ARE ALL PART OF

03:26:25.673 --> 03:26:26.574
THE RENTAL RATE.

03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:29.110
SO OF BEEN ACCESS IS BECOMING AN

03:26:29.176 --> 03:26:30.745
ISSUE YOU'LL HEAR FROM -- CCS

03:26:30.811 --> 03:26:32.446
PROGRAM A PROPENSITY TO GETTING

03:26:32.513 --> 03:26:34.115
A DELAYS IN GETTING KIDS OUT OF

03:26:34.181 --> 03:26:35.816
HOSPITALS BECAUSE A LACK OF OF

03:26:35.883 --> 03:26:37.518
THAT PATIENTS -- VENTA EQUIPMENT

03:26:37.585 --> 03:26:39.920
SO WE ARE ASKING FOR THE PROGRAM

03:26:39.987 --> 03:26:41.222
TO MOVE TO UNDER PERCENT

03:26:41.288 --> 03:26:42.656
MEDICARE RATES WHICH FEDERAL LAW

03:26:42.723 --> 03:26:44.692
ALLOWS HIM TO DO -- AND TO USE A

03:26:44.759 --> 03:26:46.227
BLENDED RATE BECAUSE THE REAL

03:26:46.293 --> 03:26:47.762
RATES UNDER MEDICARE IN

03:26:47.828 --> 03:26:49.029
CALIFORNIA DRAMATICALLY HIGHER

03:26:49.096 --> 03:26:50.598
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE

03:26:50.664 --> 03:26:51.999
VERY LOW RATES IMPACTING.

03:26:52.066 --> 03:26:53.834
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND NON

03:26:53.901 --> 03:26:55.302
URBAN AREAS WITH RATES THAT ARE

03:26:55.369 --> 03:26:57.571
NOT SUSTAINABLE -- ALSO ASKING

03:26:57.638 --> 03:26:58.506
THE TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CUSTOM

03:26:58.572 --> 03:27:01.208
REHAB AREA OF THE MEDICARE --

03:27:01.275 --> 03:27:03.177
ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS WITH THE USE

03:27:03.244 --> 03:27:04.745
OF MODIFIERS THAT UPGRADE OF THE

03:27:04.812 --> 03:27:09.316
REIMBURSEMENT CERTAIN ITEMS OF

03:27:09.383 --> 03:27:09.850
CUSTOMER YEAH BECAUSE THE

03:27:09.917 --> 03:27:11.152
COMPLEXITY.

03:27:11.218 --> 03:27:12.653
THANK YOU I TALK FAST.

03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:14.755
THANK YOU I HATE EIGHT COUNTS OF

03:27:14.822 --> 03:27:16.891
OUR HEALTH SERVICES ALEJO

03:27:16.957 --> 03:27:17.191
[inaudible]

03:27:17.258 --> 03:27:19.660
FINANCE OKAY.

03:27:19.727 --> 03:27:20.828
WE'VE ACT I MEAN IS ARE WE

03:27:20.895 --> 03:27:22.696
MONITORING ACCESS TO THE ME --

03:27:22.763 --> 03:27:24.565
YES SO -- THE STATE PLAN THAT

03:27:24.632 --> 03:27:26.133
WAS MENTIONED HAS BEEN SUBMITTED

03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:27.902
TO CMS IT IS STILL PENDING THAT

03:27:27.968 --> 03:27:29.970
DID INCLUDE AN ACCESS ASSESSMENT

03:27:30.037 --> 03:27:30.905
ON OUR PART TO THAT IT WILL BE

03:27:30.971 --> 03:27:33.541
PART OF CMS IS EVALUATION OF A

03:27:33.607 --> 03:27:34.275
APPROVING.

03:27:34.341 --> 03:27:37.545
THE THE REDUCTIONS.

03:27:37.611 --> 03:27:39.113
AND AS MENTIONED THIS IS REALLY

03:27:39.180 --> 03:27:40.447
NECESSITATED BY THE STATE LAW

03:27:40.514 --> 03:27:42.249
LIMITATION OF 80% OF MEDICARE

03:27:42.316 --> 03:27:43.317
AND THE FACT THAT.

03:27:43.384 --> 03:27:44.685
AT THIS POINT MEDICARE'S BEEN

03:27:44.752 --> 03:27:46.987
COMING DOWN AND SO THAT'S WHY --

03:27:47.054 --> 03:27:49.056
OUR STATE PLAN AND OURS OUR

03:27:49.123 --> 03:27:49.690
STATE PLAN IS BASED OFF OF THE

03:27:49.757 --> 03:27:50.658
STATE LAW.

03:27:50.724 --> 03:27:52.359
OKAY SO DO WE NEED TO WELL I

03:27:52.426 --> 03:27:54.361
MEAN SO WE BENCHMARKED AGAINST

03:27:54.428 --> 03:27:56.497
MEDICARE RATE AND WE CITY

03:27:56.564 --> 03:27:57.097
PERCENT MEDICARE MEDICARE WAS

03:27:57.164 --> 03:27:57.832
OLD.

03:27:57.898 --> 03:27:59.567
A LOT HIGHER.

03:27:59.633 --> 03:28:01.702
THE FORMER IT'S BEEN COMING DOWN

03:28:01.769 --> 03:28:02.870
PRETTY THIN COMING DOWN A COMMON

03:28:02.937 --> 03:28:04.438
EXAMPLE LOCSIN CONCENTRATOR

03:28:04.505 --> 03:28:05.940
WHICH IS PRIME A RESPIRATORY

03:28:06.006 --> 03:28:07.274
TOOL CURRENTLY MEDI CAL IS

03:28:07.341 --> 03:28:08.509
REIMBURSING HUNDRED AND FORTY

03:28:08.576 --> 03:28:09.710
FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH.

03:28:09.777 --> 03:28:10.711
THE NEW RATE WOULD BE FIFTY

03:28:10.778 --> 03:28:12.880
DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S A

03:28:12.947 --> 03:28:14.148
SIGNIFICANT YEAH.

03:28:14.215 --> 03:28:16.083
SO I MEAN I THINK.

03:28:16.150 --> 03:28:18.652
APPRECIATE IN THAT AS WELL IF IT

03:28:18.719 --> 03:28:20.354
IS A SITE.

03:28:20.421 --> 03:28:22.323
NOW WE CAN ARGUE HOW MUCH OF A

03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:24.024
MARGIN MEDICARE TRIES TO BUILD

03:28:24.091 --> 03:28:25.593
AND I GET THE IDEA OF LIKE --

03:28:25.659 --> 03:28:27.294
MAYBE SHE COME IN UNDER MEDICARE

03:28:27.361 --> 03:28:28.863
BUT IT'S MEDICARE'S REALLY

03:28:28.929 --> 03:28:30.831
COMING DOWN ON THEIR RATES AND

03:28:30.898 --> 03:28:32.199
THEY'RE TRYING TERM INTO RATES

03:28:32.266 --> 03:28:33.500
BASED ON ACTUAL COSTS AND

03:28:33.567 --> 03:28:34.969
SQUEEZING OUT PROFIT MARGIN AND

03:28:35.035 --> 03:28:36.503
WE'RE SAYING THEN YOU HAVE TO GO

03:28:36.570 --> 03:28:40.674
SUB PROFIT -- MORGADO I THINK WE

03:28:40.741 --> 03:28:43.177
HAVE SOME ISSUES SO -- I THINK

03:28:43.244 --> 03:28:44.678
WE MAY HAVE TO SOUNDS LIKE HIM

03:28:44.745 --> 03:28:45.479
HEARING A PATTERN HERE WHETHER

03:28:45.546 --> 03:28:48.816
V. NEED TO RE LOOK AT WHETHER

03:28:48.883 --> 03:28:50.751
THAT'S RIGHT BENCHMARK AND 80%

03:28:50.818 --> 03:28:53.554
OF MEDICARE OR OR IT'S A

03:28:53.621 --> 03:28:54.755
MEDICARE RATE OR SOME OTHER AND

03:28:54.822 --> 03:28:56.824
MORE INDEPENDENT BENCHMARKS THAT.

03:28:56.891 --> 03:28:58.692
ALLOWS US TO SURE ACCESS WITHOUT

03:28:58.759 --> 03:29:00.294
THE REPAIR WANTS TO BE UPROOTED

03:29:00.361 --> 03:29:01.295
PURCHASER.

03:29:01.362 --> 03:29:04.064
SO -- WE I THINK SOUNDS LIKE

03:29:04.131 --> 03:29:05.933
IT'S TIME TO MAYBE LOOK AT THAT

03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:07.368
BENCHMARK SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BUILT

03:29:07.434 --> 03:29:09.837
INTO A LOT OF IT'S A GENERAL IS

03:29:09.904 --> 03:29:12.239
GENERALLY HOW THE MEDICAID RATES

03:29:12.306 --> 03:29:14.074
ARE SET -- A LESS THERE'S A

03:29:14.141 --> 03:29:15.776
DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY SO FOR

03:29:15.843 --> 03:29:17.711
MOST OF THE TYPES OF SERVICES

03:29:17.778 --> 03:29:18.545
THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT THAT

03:29:18.612 --> 03:29:20.381
AREN'T SORT OF FACILITY SERVICES

03:29:20.447 --> 03:29:21.749
OR THINGS LIKE THAT IT IS.

03:29:21.815 --> 03:29:24.118
TYPICALLY BENCHMARKS 280% OF

03:29:24.184 --> 03:29:26.921
MEDICARE -- AND SO THEN WE HAVE

03:29:26.987 --> 03:29:28.989
TO UPDATE THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE

03:29:29.056 --> 03:29:30.791
OF THESE OF MEDICARE CHANGING

03:29:30.858 --> 03:29:31.859
THEIR RATES IN TERMS OF THE

03:29:31.926 --> 03:29:33.093
ACTUAL RATE THAT'S BEING PAID

03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:35.162
BUT YES THEY IT IS A GENERAL

03:29:35.229 --> 03:29:36.697
REQUIREMENT FOR MOST OF OUR

03:29:36.764 --> 03:29:38.332
OUTPATIENT AND SORT OF

03:29:38.399 --> 03:29:39.833
CANCELLARIA TYPE SERVICES AND IS

03:29:39.900 --> 03:29:40.234
THIS.

03:29:40.301 --> 03:29:43.170
TYPICAL OF OTHER STATES SEVEN

03:29:43.237 --> 03:29:44.838
THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY TYPICAL

03:29:44.905 --> 03:29:46.607
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY -- IT'S AN

03:29:46.674 --> 03:29:48.943
80% OF MEDICARE ARE BECAUSE IN

03:29:49.009 --> 03:29:50.511
MEDICARE RIGHT THAT'S THE

03:29:50.577 --> 03:29:52.513
PAYMENT FROM THE MEDICARE.

03:29:52.579 --> 03:29:55.449
PROGRAM AND THE 20% IS THE COST

03:29:55.516 --> 03:29:57.184
SHARING FROM THE BENEFICIARY --

03:29:57.251 --> 03:30:00.821
SO THAT IT IS A VERY TYPICAL

03:30:00.888 --> 03:30:01.689
STANDARD.

03:30:01.755 --> 03:30:02.523
OKAY THAT IS WHERE IT REGIONALLY

03:30:02.589 --> 03:30:04.258
CAME FROM WHENEVER HOWEVER MANY

03:30:04.325 --> 03:30:05.726
YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS HERE THAT.

03:30:05.793 --> 03:30:06.560
RIGHT BUT BUT I THINK WHAT IT

03:30:06.627 --> 03:30:07.962
BUT I'VE OBVIOUSLY THEN ON THE

03:30:08.028 --> 03:30:10.397
MEDICARE SIDE IS IS THAT THERE'S

03:30:10.464 --> 03:30:12.299
THE BENEFICIARY COST SHARING

03:30:12.366 --> 03:30:13.801
YOUR PAIN THE OTHER 20% OR TO

03:30:13.867 --> 03:30:15.569
HAVE A MEDIGAP PLAN OR SOMETHING

03:30:15.636 --> 03:30:16.670
THAT COVERS AT THIS CASE.

03:30:16.737 --> 03:30:18.505
WE'RE NOT EXPECTING LOW INCOME

03:30:18.572 --> 03:30:22.042
FAMILIES TO COUGH UP THE OTHER

03:30:22.109 --> 03:30:22.309
IMPORTANT.

03:30:22.376 --> 03:30:23.978
SO.

03:30:24.044 --> 03:30:25.846
SO WE I THINK WE'RE CLOSE THE

03:30:25.913 --> 03:30:28.115
SAY WE'VE THE THE ALMOST MANY

03:30:28.182 --> 03:30:29.483
OCCASIONS HERE IN THIS.

03:30:29.550 --> 03:30:30.150
THE SUBCOMMITTEE SINCE I'VE BEEN

03:30:30.217 --> 03:30:32.186
IN HERE WE'VE HAD RULES THAT ARE

03:30:32.252 --> 03:30:34.088
IN PLACE FOR DECADES THAT THE

03:30:34.154 --> 03:30:35.956
LONGER WORK AND I THINK IT'S

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:37.491
PERHAPS TIME TO RE LOOK AT THEM.

03:30:37.558 --> 03:30:38.158
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S

03:30:38.225 --> 03:30:41.662
A CMS ISSUES RELATED TO THAT BUT

03:30:41.729 --> 03:30:42.296
I MEAN IT THEY WOULD ALL

03:30:42.363 --> 03:30:44.131
REQUIRES FEDERAL APPROVALS

03:30:44.198 --> 03:30:46.367
BECAUSE THEY 80% LIMITATION IS

03:30:46.433 --> 03:30:49.370
IN ANY ANY OF OUR STATE PLANS --

03:30:49.436 --> 03:30:52.906
THE ONLY LIMITATION -- OTHERWISE

03:30:52.973 --> 03:30:55.142
AND IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE ARMY IS

03:30:55.209 --> 03:30:56.510
THE LIMITATION TO A 100% OF

03:30:56.577 --> 03:30:57.811
MEDICARE THAT ACTUALLY DOES NOT

03:30:57.878 --> 03:31:00.147
EXIST FOR ANY OTHER SERVICES BUT

03:31:00.214 --> 03:31:02.182
THAT WAS PART OF THE CURE'S ACT.

03:31:02.249 --> 03:31:04.184
SO THAT THAT LIMITATION -- IS A

03:31:04.251 --> 03:31:06.620
FEDERAL LIMITATION BUT OTHERWISE.

03:31:06.687 --> 03:31:08.689
MEDICARE ITSELF IS NOT ACTUALLY

03:31:08.756 --> 03:31:12.159
A LIMITATION -- IN GENERAL I

03:31:12.226 --> 03:31:13.227
MEAN ON THE FACILITY SIDE UPPER

03:31:13.293 --> 03:31:14.395
PAYMENT LIMITS ARE BASED ON A

03:31:14.461 --> 03:31:15.763
MEDICARE WOULD PAY BACK ON THESE

03:31:15.829 --> 03:31:16.930
TYPES OF SERVICES IT WAS A BIT

03:31:16.997 --> 03:31:18.399
THIS WAS A VERY SPECIFICALLY

03:31:18.465 --> 03:31:19.566
CALLED OUT.

03:31:19.633 --> 03:31:21.902
IN THAT IN THAT BILL OKAY SO SO

03:31:21.969 --> 03:31:23.003
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

03:31:23.070 --> 03:31:24.838
SUGGESTING PERHAPS WE JUST SINCE

03:31:24.905 --> 03:31:26.507
IT'S A LIMIT AND THEN JUST DO A

03:31:26.573 --> 03:31:28.642
100% OF MEDICARE AND IT'S

03:31:28.709 --> 03:31:30.277
MEDICARE'S REALLY CRANKING DOWN

03:31:30.344 --> 03:31:30.477
THEN.

03:31:30.544 --> 03:31:35.716
THAT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE THAN.

03:31:35.783 --> 03:31:37.051
EIGHTY OKAY AND I WOULD ALSO

03:31:37.117 --> 03:31:37.918
VENTURE TO SAY IT'S A MEASURING

03:31:37.985 --> 03:31:38.819
ACCESS NOW BEFORE THESE NEW

03:31:38.886 --> 03:31:39.520
RATES ARE IN PLACE IS REALLY NOT.

03:31:39.586 --> 03:31:40.120
A BAROMETER WHAT'S GOING TO

03:31:40.187 --> 03:31:41.221
HAPPEN I MEAN ONCE PEOPLE

03:31:41.288 --> 03:31:42.890
REALIZE THIS THROUGH PAID

03:31:42.956 --> 03:31:43.524
THEY'RE NOT GONNA PROVIDING THE

03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:45.192
SERVICE A LOT OF PARTS OF

03:31:45.259 --> 03:31:45.993
CALIFORNIA RIGHT WELL RIGHT NEW

03:31:46.060 --> 03:31:47.728
MEASURE NOW IT'S THE SITUATION

03:31:47.795 --> 03:31:48.562
NOW.

03:31:48.629 --> 03:31:50.931
SO IT'S NOT THEN WHEN WHEN DO WE

03:31:50.998 --> 03:31:52.266
EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN.

03:31:52.332 --> 03:31:54.468
SO THE STATE PLAN IS WITH CMS I

03:31:54.535 --> 03:31:56.570
WILL I ASSUME FOLKS KNOW THIS

03:31:56.637 --> 03:31:58.138
PART OF THEIR PROCESS ALSO IS

03:31:58.205 --> 03:31:59.173
TAKING.

03:31:59.239 --> 03:32:01.475
A STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON THE

03:32:01.542 --> 03:32:03.577
POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR ACCESS --

03:32:03.644 --> 03:32:06.013
MOST SO YOU KNOW AT WE RARELY

03:32:06.080 --> 03:32:07.915
GET A STATE PLAN APPROVED IN THE

03:32:07.981 --> 03:32:08.982
NINETY DAY TIME FRAME SO I MEAN

03:32:09.049 --> 03:32:10.617
I I WOULD GUESS WERE PROBABLY

03:32:10.684 --> 03:32:12.419
STILL A FEW MONTHS AWAY FROM

03:32:12.486 --> 03:32:14.455
APPROVAL IF I MEAN AND AGAIN AND

03:32:14.521 --> 03:32:15.923
THEY COULD NOT GIVE APPROVAL.

03:32:15.989 --> 03:32:18.092
AS ANOTHER AS ANOTHER OPTION BUT

03:32:18.158 --> 03:32:20.094
IT IS CURRENTLY SLATED TO BE

03:32:20.160 --> 03:32:22.362

COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA --

03:34:01.361 --> 03:34:02.796
COMPLEX READ TECHNOLOGY IS

03:34:02.863 --> 03:34:05.032
SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT USED BY.

03:34:05.098 --> 03:34:06.466

LEVEL DISABILITY SO -- IT'S

03:34:08.669 --> 03:34:10.304
SOMETHING THEY DEPEND ON ON A

03:34:10.370 --> 03:34:12.072
DAILY BASIS BUT INCLUDE SUCH

03:34:12.139 --> 03:34:14.041
THINGS AS SPECIALIZE WHEELCHAIRS

AND SEATING SYSTEMS -- OTHER

03:34:16.009 --> 03:34:18.111
ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT LIKE STANDING

03:34:18.178 --> 03:34:22.616
DEVICES IN GAY TRAINERS -- IT'S

03:34:22.683 --> 03:34:25.319
PROVIDED THROUGH A VERY -- TIME --

03:34:25.385 --> 03:34:26.186
LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS INVOLVES

03:34:26.253 --> 03:34:26.787
THE PHYSICIAN THAT TYPICALLY

03:34:26.853 --> 03:34:28.288
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST OR

03:34:28.355 --> 03:34:29.423
PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

03:34:29.489 --> 03:34:32.025
AND THEN -- THE SUPPLIER ALONG

03:34:32.092 --> 03:34:32.926
WITH POTENTIALLY OTHER

03:34:32.993 --> 03:34:34.494
CLINICIANS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY

03:34:34.561 --> 03:34:36.330
THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOMETIMES

03:34:36.396 --> 03:34:38.165
THEIR FAMILY OR CARE GIVERS.

03:34:38.232 --> 03:34:39.466
IT'S VERY INTENSE A SERVICE

03:34:39.533 --> 03:34:40.801
INTENSIVE AND IT'S FOR A REALLY

03:34:40.867 --> 03:34:42.102
A SMALL POPULATION AGAIN PEOPLE

03:34:42.169 --> 03:34:43.070
THAT HAVE.

03:34:43.136 --> 03:34:44.805
VERY COMPLEX NEEDS AND ONE OF

03:34:44.871 --> 03:34:46.273
OUR CHALLENGES IS THAT IT GETS

03:34:46.340 --> 03:34:47.708
LOST SOMETIMES IN THE BROADER

03:34:47.774 --> 03:34:49.176
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CATEGORY

03:34:49.243 --> 03:34:51.645
BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL PIECE OF

03:34:51.712 --> 03:34:53.013
THAT IT'S A SMALL POPULATION.

03:34:53.080 --> 03:34:54.514
SO -- THE CHALLENGES THAT

03:34:54.581 --> 03:34:56.016
PROVIDERS ARE FACING IT IS JUST

03:34:56.083 --> 03:34:58.552
THE COMMITMENT THAT'S REQUIRED

03:34:58.619 --> 03:35:00.220
TO RUN A BUSINESS IN THIS ARENA

03:35:00.287 --> 03:35:02.422
THAT TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

03:35:02.489 --> 03:35:04.391
AND THE CREDENTIAL PEOPLE. TO DO

03:35:04.458 --> 03:35:06.159
THE EVALUATION TO NOT ONLY GET

03:35:06.226 --> 03:35:06.893
THE EQUIPMENT RIGHT THE FIRST

03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:08.829
TIME BUT THEN ONCE SOMEONE HAS

03:35:08.895 --> 03:35:09.997
THIS KIND OF EQUIPMENT.

03:35:10.063 --> 03:35:11.565
IT'S PART OF THEIR DAILY LIFE SO

03:35:11.632 --> 03:35:12.966
IF THERE'S A REPAIR THAT'S

03:35:13.033 --> 03:35:14.401
NEEDED -- IF THERE'S MAINTENANCE

03:35:14.468 --> 03:35:16.136
NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT IN

03:35:16.203 --> 03:35:17.271
A SIMPLE EXAMPLE LIKE A

03:35:17.337 --> 03:35:18.472
WHEELCHAIR SOMEONE IS A

03:35:18.538 --> 03:35:19.206
WHEELCHAIR WAS SPECIALIZED

03:35:19.273 --> 03:35:20.207
SEATING.

03:35:20.274 --> 03:35:21.908
THAT WHEELCHAIR BREAKS DOWN A

03:35:21.975 --> 03:35:23.977
LOS AND TELL THAT SHARES FIX

03:35:24.044 --> 03:35:25.112
THEIR PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN

03:35:25.178 --> 03:35:26.647
THEIR BAD -- IN THAT THE FLIES

03:35:26.713 --> 03:35:27.581
WHETHER AGAIN YOU'RE TALKING

03:35:27.648 --> 03:35:29.316
ABOUT A CHILD ADULT SOMEONE

03:35:29.383 --> 03:35:30.017
WHO'S GOING TO SCHOOL WE'RE

03:35:30.083 --> 03:35:32.319
GOING TO WORK -- SO OUR

03:35:32.386 --> 03:35:33.987
CHALLENGE REALLY IS -- WHO IS

03:35:34.054 --> 03:35:36.323
THE -- COVERING THOSE COST AND

03:35:36.390 --> 03:35:37.891
ALSO MAKING IN -- THE

03:35:37.958 --> 03:35:39.860
ENVIRONMENT SUITABLE FOR

03:35:39.926 --> 03:35:40.560
COMPANIES TO STAY IN THIS

03:35:40.627 --> 03:35:42.362
BUSINESS AS A MENTION IS ONLY

03:35:42.429 --> 03:35:44.131
EIGHT COMPANIES AND CALIFORNIA

03:35:44.197 --> 03:35:45.632
THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT AND

03:35:45.699 --> 03:35:50.137
AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE OF THE

03:35:50.203 --> 03:35:51.672
CHALLENGES THAT COMPANIES FACE --

03:35:51.738 --> 03:35:52.339
SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS --

03:35:52.406 --> 03:35:53.206
REALLY REQUESTING TWO THINGS ONE

03:35:53.273 --> 03:35:55.542
IS THE RESURGENT RELIEF FROM THE

03:35:55.609 --> 03:35:58.245
AB 9710% CAUGHT.

03:35:58.312 --> 03:36:00.380
AND ALSO THE MODIFICATION OF THE

03:36:00.447 --> 03:36:02.115
UPPER BILLION LIMIT THAT APPLIES

03:36:02.182 --> 03:36:03.917
TO THESE ITEMS AND LOOKING

03:36:03.984 --> 03:36:05.385
FORWARD TO BE MODIFIED TO ALLOW

03:36:05.452 --> 03:36:07.888
SOME LABOR COMPONENT TO BE ADDED

03:36:07.954 --> 03:36:10.757
TO THE CALCULATION -- AND ALSO

03:36:10.824 --> 03:36:12.192
TO LOOK AT THE TOTAL WHEELCHAIR

03:36:12.259 --> 03:36:15.162
VERSES INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS --

03:36:15.228 --> 03:36:16.763
WHAT WE THINK IS THIS REALLY FOR

03:36:16.830 --> 03:36:18.799
LEASE PROVIDE -- SOME --

03:36:18.865 --> 03:36:20.500
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR

03:36:20.567 --> 03:36:21.468
COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING

03:36:21.535 --> 03:36:23.070
THIS WE ALSO HAVE THE SAME

03:36:23.136 --> 03:36:24.538
CONCERNS ABOUT MENTION ABOUT THE

03:36:24.604 --> 03:36:25.906
SPA THAT'S BEING THAT IT'S BEING

03:36:25.972 --> 03:36:27.040
PROPOSED.

03:36:27.107 --> 03:36:27.574
AGAIN IT'S GOING TO HAVE

03:36:27.641 --> 03:36:29.543
REDUCTIONS IN IMPACT ALSO THIS

03:36:29.609 --> 03:36:31.611
ARENA AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL

03:36:31.678 --> 03:36:32.679
PRESSURES THAT COMPANIES ARE

03:36:32.746 --> 03:36:34.848
UNDER IT'S ONLY GONNA MAKE

03:36:34.915 --> 03:36:36.416
ACCESS AND EVEN BIGGER ISSUE --

03:36:36.483 --> 03:36:37.250
AND THEN THE FINAL THING JUST

03:36:37.317 --> 03:36:38.518
FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE IS

DIFFICULTY FOR THESE PATIENTS.

03:39:21.047 --> 03:39:22.616
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH A LOT OF

03:39:22.682 --> 03:39:24.684
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS PAY

03:39:24.751 --> 03:39:26.820

THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS IN

03:39:38.064 --> 03:39:39.633
RESOLVING THIS PROBLEM.

03:39:39.699 --> 03:39:41.234
THE OTHER INTERESTING THING IS

03:39:41.301 --> 03:39:43.036
THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL MAKE

03:39:43.103 --> 03:39:44.304
CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS THAT THEY'RE

03:39:44.371 --> 03:39:45.639
FACED WITH LAWSUITS OR

03:39:45.705 --> 03:39:46.940
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DECISIONS

03:39:47.007 --> 03:39:48.308
THAT ARE ADVERSE.

03:39:48.375 --> 03:39:49.442
THEY WILL MAKE ALL KINDS OF

03:39:49.509 --> 03:39:52.045
EXCEPTIONS PAY -- FOR UNLOADED

03:39:52.112 --> 03:39:54.981
MILES -- ADICIONAL MILEAGE

03:39:55.048 --> 03:39:56.449
REIMBURSEMENT RATES WAITING

03:39:56.516 --> 03:39:58.852
TIMES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE.

03:39:58.919 --> 03:40:00.387
TO THE ONLY MAKE THESE

03:40:00.453 --> 03:40:02.188
EXCEPTIONS ON THESE UNUSUAL

03:40:02.255 --> 03:40:04.658

VISIBLE PATIENTS.

03:40:09.396 --> 03:40:11.431
SO WE THINK THE THE SITUATION

03:40:11.498 --> 03:40:13.366
JUSTIFIES THE INCREASE WOULD

03:40:13.433 --> 03:40:15.035
TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO

UP THE WHOLE AMOUNT.

03:41:50.363 --> 03:41:51.364
OR NOT IS THERE SOME WAY TO

03:41:51.431 --> 03:41:53.333
QUANTIFY THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE

03:41:53.400 --> 03:41:54.734
HELPFUL.

03:41:54.801 --> 03:41:55.635
I REALIZE THAT THERE MAY NOT BE

03:41:55.702 --> 03:41:57.337
THAT EASY TO DO THAT YEAH I MEAN

03:41:57.404 --> 03:41:59.572
I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T LOOKED

03:41:59.639 --> 03:42:01.174
AT IT FROM THAT PRSPECTIVE I

03:42:01.241 --> 03:42:01.408
THINK.

03:42:01.474 --> 03:42:03.243
AS MENTIONED THE VAST MAJORITY

03:42:03.309 --> 03:42:05.245
OF THIS IS A MANAGED CARE -- AND

03:42:05.311 --> 03:42:09.015
pMEMBERS ARE SMALLER -- I DON'T

03:42:09.082 --> 03:42:10.884
KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN ANY SORT OF

03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:12.852
SPECIFIC CHANGES IN UTILIZATION

03:42:12.919 --> 03:42:14.854
OF OF TRANSPORTATION THAT WOULD

03:42:14.921 --> 03:42:18.191
IMPLY THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW.

03:42:18.258 --> 03:42:20.326
MY TEAMMATE BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE

03:42:20.393 --> 03:42:21.094
THAT I CAN ASK THEM I JUST DON'T

03:42:21.161 --> 03:42:21.995
KNOW.

03:42:22.062 --> 03:42:23.563
WHAT THE FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENT

03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:25.198
LOAD IS DIMINISHING IT'S TURNING

03:42:25.265 --> 03:42:27.033
ALL THE TIME PEOPLE FALL IN AND

03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:29.002
OUT OF MANAGED CARE SO THEN THEY

03:42:29.069 --> 03:42:30.203
GO FOR MANAGED CARE WHERE THEY

03:42:30.270 --> 03:42:31.404
WERE GETTING GOOD SERVICE?

03:42:31.471 --> 03:42:32.806
BACK TO FEE FOR SERVICE BECAUSE

03:42:32.872 --> 03:42:33.940
THEY FAILED TO FILE RIGHT

03:42:34.007 --> 03:42:35.642
PAPERWORK OR SOMETHING OR OTHER

03:42:35.709 --> 03:42:37.310
SO THEN -- BACK -- WITHOUT TO

03:42:37.377 --> 03:42:39.546
SERVICE FOR SIX EIGHT TEN MONTHS

03:42:39.612 --> 03:42:40.647
TILL THEY GET BACK ON MANAGED

03:42:40.714 --> 03:42:43.349
CARE SO IT'S A CONSTANT THE

03:42:43.416 --> 03:42:44.751
MATTER AND THERE'S ALWAYS NEW

03:42:44.818 --> 03:42:46.486
FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS COMING

03:42:46.553 --> 03:42:47.854
UP ON TO THE PROGRAM BEFORE

03:42:47.921 --> 03:42:48.855
THEIR SIDE.

03:42:48.922 --> 03:42:50.256
SO THEY MAY BE SMALL IN NUMBER

03:42:50.323 --> 03:42:52.392
BUT IT TO CONTINUALLY --

03:42:52.459 --> 03:42:54.828
EXISTING GROUP OF ABOUT 20% OF

03:42:54.894 --> 03:42:56.429
THE PATIENTS SOLELY THEY'RE NOT

03:42:56.496 --> 03:42:58.865
TO BE -- JUST DISMISSED AS BEING

03:42:58.932 --> 03:43:01.401
A SMALL GROUP BUT IF THE THE FOR

AND I WOULD JUST ADD.

03:44:19.746 --> 03:44:20.480
THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE

03:44:20.547 --> 03:44:22.215
LEGISLATURE IS SO MUCH AT THE

03:44:22.282 --> 03:44:23.316
MERCY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:44:23.383 --> 03:44:24.951

03:44:25.018 --> 03:44:26.386
MIGHT HAVE BEEN INDICATED.

03:44:26.452 --> 03:44:27.954
IT'S TRUE THAT PROP FIFTY FIVES

03:44:28.021 --> 03:44:29.088
GIVES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

03:44:29.155 --> 03:44:30.423
DISCRETION OVER THAT FORMULA BUT

03:44:30.490 --> 03:44:31.825
IT DOESN'T SPECIFY THE FORMULA

03:44:31.891 --> 03:44:33.026
AND SO WE'VE YOU THIS IS

03:44:33.092 --> 03:44:34.294
SOMETHING THAT'S COMPLETELY UP

03:44:34.360 --> 03:44:35.395

ELSE THAT'S IN THE BUDGET.

03:44:36.596 --> 03:44:38.798

03:44:39.432 --> 03:44:41.234

LEGISLATURE OR BOTH WOULD ADOPT

03:44:43.069 --> 03:44:44.470
A BETTER FORMULA THAT WE THINK

03:44:44.537 --> 03:44:45.305
IS MORE IN KEEPING WITH VOTER

03:44:45.371 --> 03:44:46.840
INTENT AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY

03:44:46.906 --> 03:44:48.408
THINK THAT FORMULA GENERATED WE

03:44:48.474 --> 03:44:49.542
MIGHT HAVE A MORE ROBUST.

DONE EVER.

04:03:23.689 --> 04:03:24.556
DONE A VERY QUICKLY AND

04:03:24.623 --> 04:03:25.590
SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

04:03:25.657 --> 04:03:26.925
WE DON'T KNOWLEDGE TIMES WHEN

04:03:26.992 --> 04:03:28.193
OUR STATE GOVERNMENT AND OUR

04:03:28.260 --> 04:03:29.594
EMPLOYEES INTERACTION.

04:03:29.661 --> 04:03:30.595
THINGS QUICKLY WE JUST LOOK AT

04:03:30.662 --> 04:03:32.397
THE TIMES WHEN THINGS DON'T GO

04:03:32.464 --> 04:03:34.866
SO FAST.

04:03:34.933 --> 04:03:36.168
I THINK SO SHE DOES THE TEAM

04:03:36.234 --> 04:03:37.302
WHO'S WORKED ON IT HAS DONE A

04:03:37.369 --> 04:03:40.839
TREMENDOUS JOB YES EXCELLENT WE

04:03:40.906 --> 04:03:42.207
LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF

04:03:42.274 --> 04:03:42.708
THEIR WORK CELL.

04:03:42.774 --> 04:03:44.176
ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO

04:03:44.242 --> 04:03:46.378
ISSUE NUMBER TEN IT'S THE

04:03:46.445 --> 04:03:48.046
PROPOSITION VALUE BASED PAYMENT

04:03:48.113 --> 04:03:49.047
PROGRAM OR SO AS PART OF THE

04:03:49.114 --> 04:03:50.682
JANUARY BUDGET THE GOVERNOR DID

04:03:50.749 --> 04:03:52.184
PROPOSE -- IS THREE HUNDRED

04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:53.685
SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR FOR

04:03:53.752 --> 04:03:55.053
THREE YEARS VALUE BASED PAYMENT

04:03:55.120 --> 04:03:58.056
PROGRAM WE DID RELEASE AS NOTED

04:03:58.123 --> 04:03:59.224
IN THE AGENDA AT THE DOOR THE

04:03:59.291 --> 04:04:01.493
INITIAL LIST OF OF MEASURES.

04:04:01.560 --> 04:04:02.961
WITHIN SORT OF THE FOR DOMAIN

04:04:03.028 --> 04:04:05.330
AREAS THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR

04:04:05.397 --> 04:04:07.165
AND THE AGENCY REALLY FELT WE

04:04:07.232 --> 04:04:08.333
SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON AND THAT'S

04:04:08.400 --> 04:04:10.869
PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM CARE

04:04:10.936 --> 04:04:11.603
EARLY CHILDHOOD PREVENTION.

04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:13.405
CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND

04:04:13.472 --> 04:04:15.674
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION --

04:04:15.741 --> 04:04:24.750
MET JUST TO QUICKLY HI LATE OVER

04:04:24.816 --> 04:04:26.284
BECAUSE IT BECAUSE I KNOW IT.

04:04:26.351 --> 04:04:26.818
THIS PROGRAM IS A LITTLE

04:04:26.885 --> 04:04:27.386
DIFFERENT AND I THINK SOME

04:04:27.452 --> 04:04:28.053
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO

04:04:28.120 --> 04:04:28.653
BE AN AND REALLY THAT IS YOU

04:04:28.720 --> 04:04:29.321
KNOW WE HAD TO STRUCTURE IT IN A

04:04:29.388 --> 04:04:30.022
WAY.

04:04:30.088 --> 04:04:31.023
THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD THE DATA TO

04:04:31.089 --> 04:04:32.224
DO THIS AND THIS IS DOING VALUE

04:04:32.290 --> 04:04:33.558
BASED PAYMENT ON THE PHYSICIAN

04:04:33.625 --> 04:04:34.526
LEVEL.

04:04:34.593 --> 04:04:36.028
IT IS NOT AT THE PLAN OR THE

04:04:36.094 --> 04:04:37.095
GROUP LEVEL.

04:04:37.162 --> 04:04:38.630
SO WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:04:38.697 --> 04:04:40.565
WHATEVER DATA WE WERE USING YOU

04:04:40.632 --> 04:04:42.000
COULD ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT

04:04:42.067 --> 04:04:43.502
DETERMINE PAYMENTS FROM THAT SO

04:04:43.568 --> 04:04:45.070
JUST A FLAG THAT BECAUSE I KNOW

04:04:45.137 --> 04:04:45.904
IT IS DIFFERENT THAN YOU KNOW

04:04:45.971 --> 04:04:48.440
SORT OF SOME MORE OTHER TYPICAL

04:04:48.507 --> 04:04:50.242
VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAMS --

04:04:50.308 --> 04:04:52.277
MET SO WE AS NOTED DID DID

04:04:52.344 --> 04:04:54.646
RECEIVE COMMENTS WE ARE JUST

04:04:54.713 --> 04:04:56.715
FINALISING -- THE REVIEW OF

04:04:56.782 --> 04:04:58.483
THOSE I KNOW THE QUESTION WAS

04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:59.918
WOULD IT BE CHANGING SUBSTANDARD

04:04:59.985 --> 04:05:01.720
OR SIGNIFICANTLY -- I DON'T KNOW

04:05:01.787 --> 04:05:03.155
THAT SIGNIFICANTLY BUT WE ARE

04:05:03.221 --> 04:05:04.356
LOOKING AT SOME ADDITIONAL

04:05:04.423 --> 04:05:07.025
MEASURES THAT WERE SUGGESTED --

04:05:07.092 --> 04:05:08.527
THAT WE THINK COULD COULD MAKE

04:05:08.593 --> 04:05:10.662
SENSE TO ADD AND SO WERE THE

04:05:10.729 --> 04:05:12.230
TEAM IS COMPILING ALL OF THAT

04:05:12.297 --> 04:05:14.132
RIGHT NOW BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE

04:05:14.199 --> 04:05:14.933
ABLE TO HAVE THAT OUT PRETTY

04:05:15.000 --> 04:05:17.436
SOON -- SO THAT FOLKS CAN SEE

04:05:17.502 --> 04:05:18.937
THE FINAL AND THEN AS WE HAD

04:05:19.004 --> 04:05:20.972
NOTED IN THE RELEASE OF THE

04:05:21.039 --> 04:05:23.275
DRAFT THERE WAS NO -- VALUATION

04:05:23.341 --> 04:05:25.110
OF THE MEASURES LIKE HOW MUCH

04:05:25.177 --> 04:05:26.645
MONEY YOU WOULD GET FOR

04:05:26.711 --> 04:05:27.746
PARTICULAR ACHIEVEMENT.

04:05:27.813 --> 04:05:29.548
WE FELT WE NEEDED TO FINALIZE

04:05:29.614 --> 04:05:31.383
THE MEASUREMENT LAST BEFORE THEN

04:05:31.450 --> 04:05:32.784
WE COULD START TO HAVE THAT SO

04:05:32.851 --> 04:05:34.419
ONCE WE GET THAT FINALIZE WILL

04:05:34.486 --> 04:05:35.687
START TO TALK ABOUT SRT OF THE

04:05:35.754 --> 04:05:37.589
BEGINNING OF THE MONEY INTO THE

04:05:37.656 --> 04:05:38.890
FOR AREAS.

04:05:38.957 --> 04:05:42.627
AND HOW WE THINK -- THE

04:05:42.694 --> 04:05:43.195
DIFFERENT MEASURE SHOULD BE

04:05:43.261 --> 04:05:45.297
VALUED.

04:05:45.363 --> 04:05:47.499
SARAH COMES MEGLIO.

04:05:47.566 --> 04:05:50.135
IN A REPORT WE DID THE WE DID.

04:05:50.202 --> 04:05:52.037
PRELIMINARILY EVALUATE THIS AND

04:05:52.104 --> 04:05:53.405
SORT OF WE DID PROPOSE

04:05:53.472 --> 04:05:55.841
ALTERNATIVELY -- THAT THE

04:05:55.907 --> 04:05:57.542
LEGISLATURE COULD USE THIS

04:05:57.609 --> 04:05:59.144
FUNDING TO PROVIDE -- VALUE

04:05:59.211 --> 04:06:00.612
BASED PAYMENTS MORE ON THE

04:06:00.679 --> 04:06:02.681
MANAGED CARE LEVEL -- GIVEN THE

04:06:02.747 --> 04:06:04.082
SORT OF DELEGATED MODEL WE WOULD

04:06:04.149 --> 04:06:05.584
YOU KNOW -- ASSESS THEIR

04:06:05.650 --> 04:06:07.085
PERFORMANCE ACCORDING TO THESE

04:06:07.152 --> 04:06:08.386
MEASURES AND THEN PAY THEM AND

04:06:08.453 --> 04:06:10.188
THEY WOULD -- PAY PROVIDERS AS

04:06:10.255 --> 04:06:11.356
NEED BE SO THAT IS AN

04:06:11.423 --> 04:06:13.225
ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCT TO WHAT

04:06:13.291 --> 04:06:17.028
THE GOVERNOR HAS -- HAS A

04:06:17.095 --> 04:06:19.297
PROPOSED TO DO WITH THIS FUNDING --

04:06:19.364 --> 04:06:20.298
IN IN LIGHT THOUGH.

04:06:20.365 --> 04:06:25.003
OF THE THE THE NAME PREVENTIVE

04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:26.371
SERVICE FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS

04:06:26.438 --> 04:06:28.473
THE SORT OF MORE GENERAL

04:06:28.540 --> 04:06:29.975
INCREASED ENFORCEMENT.

04:06:30.041 --> 04:06:34.246
OF HE THIS MEASURES ANOTHER --

04:06:34.312 --> 04:06:36.181
ACCESSING QUALITY MEASURES WE DO

04:06:36.248 --> 04:06:38.283
HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR

04:06:38.350 --> 04:06:39.885
NOT SOME OF THE VALUE BASED

04:06:39.951 --> 04:06:40.719
PAYMENTS ARE SOMEWHAT

04:06:40.785 --> 04:06:42.020
DUPLICATIVE WITH WHAT WE ARE

04:06:42.087 --> 04:06:43.355
DOING A LOT MORE ON THE

04:06:43.421 --> 04:06:47.092
OVERSIGHT SIDE OF THINGS -- SO

04:06:47.159 --> 04:06:48.226
WE'LL GET INTO THAT I THINK --

04:06:48.293 --> 04:06:49.961
ON THE ON THE NEXT ITEM AS WELL

04:06:50.028 --> 04:06:51.730
SO ARE THERE MEASURES THAT WE

04:06:51.796 --> 04:06:53.698
ARE NOW REALLY ENFORCING HOLDING

04:06:53.765 --> 04:06:55.467
MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE

04:06:55.534 --> 04:06:59.171
FOR ACHIEVING -- AND THEN ALSO --

04:06:59.237 --> 04:07:01.339
SORT OF ON THE OTHER SIDE ALSO

04:07:01.406 --> 04:07:03.141
PAYING A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT

04:07:03.208 --> 04:07:04.176
NOTHING WRONG WITH NECESSARILY

04:07:04.242 --> 04:07:06.811
BEEN DOING BOTH BUT ONE ONE

04:07:06.878 --> 04:07:08.146
OPTION MAY BE A MORE COST

04:07:08.213 --> 04:07:11.183
EFFECTIVE WAY. TO DO SO AND

04:07:11.249 --> 04:07:13.018
MOREOVER MANAGED CARE PLANS

04:07:13.084 --> 04:07:14.953
MIGHT NEED TO BE PAID FOR SOME

04:07:15.020 --> 04:07:16.721
OF THE MORE -- FOR THE GREATER

04:07:16.788 --> 04:07:18.757
ADHERENCE -- TO THE HIGHER

04:07:18.823 --> 04:07:19.958
STANDARDS THAT THE STATE IS

04:07:20.025 --> 04:07:21.760
IMPOSING SO WE JUST TO HAVE SOME

04:07:21.826 --> 04:07:23.929
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT --

04:07:23.995 --> 04:07:25.664
AT LEAST FOR SOME OF THE NEW

04:07:25.730 --> 04:07:26.765
VALUE BASED PAYMENTS WHETHER OR

04:07:26.831 --> 04:07:28.166
NOT THEY REPRESENT A COST

04:07:28.233 --> 04:07:29.868
EFFECTIVE SOLUTION IN LIGHT OF

04:07:29.935 --> 04:07:31.403
THE FACT THAT WE ARE -- THE

04:07:31.469 --> 04:07:32.871
STATE IS REALLY INCREASING ITS

04:07:32.938 --> 04:07:36.808
ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY

04:07:36.875 --> 04:07:37.776
MEASURES [inaudible]

04:07:37.842 --> 04:07:44.549
FINANCE. THIRTY MIGHT BE

04:07:44.616 --> 04:07:48.386
INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE

04:07:48.453 --> 04:07:49.955
PLACES WATER SOME OVERLAP AND

04:07:50.021 --> 04:07:51.489
SEE HOW MUCH THAT MOVES THE

04:07:51.556 --> 04:07:53.658
NEEDLE VERSES THE PLACES WHERE

04:07:53.725 --> 04:07:54.459
THERE ISN'T.

04:07:54.526 --> 04:07:57.495
OF ANY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

04:07:57.562 --> 04:08:00.165
FROM A VALUATION STANDPOINT.

04:08:00.232 --> 04:08:01.433
AT THE RADICALLY YOU THINK ALL

04:08:01.499 --> 04:08:04.035
WOULD DUPLICATING SO THEREFORE.

04:08:04.102 --> 04:08:05.437
YOU KNOW THEM IT'S JUST THAT

04:08:05.503 --> 04:08:06.271
DOUBLING UP OR WERE DOUBLE

04:08:06.338 --> 04:08:07.806
PAYING FOR SOMETHING BUT I I

04:08:07.872 --> 04:08:09.641
JUST A POSE THAT QUESTION TO YOU

04:08:09.708 --> 04:08:11.476
IS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY DID

04:08:11.543 --> 04:08:12.277
RESEARCH ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

04:08:12.344 --> 04:08:12.444
SO.

04:08:12.510 --> 04:08:14.212
YEAH I MEAN AS A AS A RESEARCHER

04:08:14.279 --> 04:08:15.814
AT THAT DEFERRED YOUR EXPERTISE

04:08:15.880 --> 04:08:17.215
THERE THE MEASURES CAN BE A

04:08:17.282 --> 04:08:18.850
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I THINK SO

04:08:18.917 --> 04:08:19.651
MAYBE ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:08:19.718 --> 04:08:21.286
INTEGRATION I'M NOT SURE OR YOU

04:08:21.353 --> 04:08:23.121
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S SORT

04:08:23.188 --> 04:08:25.390
OF A CORRESPONDING -- SAY -- HE

04:08:25.457 --> 04:08:26.891
THIS ENFORCEMENT MEASURE THAT'S

04:08:26.958 --> 04:08:28.627
GOING ON AND HOW DO YOU SORT OF

04:08:28.693 --> 04:08:30.328
COMPARE SAY THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

04:08:30.395 --> 04:08:32.430
INTEGRATION -- TO YOU KNOW A

04:08:32.497 --> 04:08:34.099
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING OR WELL

04:08:34.165 --> 04:08:35.367
CHILD VISIT SO.

04:08:35.433 --> 04:08:36.735
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS

04:08:36.801 --> 04:08:42.407
POTENTIAL PROMISE THERE -- BUT

04:08:42.474 --> 04:08:45.176
WE HAVE TO EVALUATE IT FOR THEIR

04:08:45.243 --> 04:08:46.645
ALL RIGHT -- SO I DO APPRECIATE

04:08:46.711 --> 04:08:48.880
THE THIS -- AFTER VALUE BASED

04:08:48.947 --> 04:08:53.285
PAYMENT -- AND IN FACT -- AND

04:08:53.351 --> 04:08:54.185
THE FACT APPRECIATE THAT AND

04:08:54.252 --> 04:08:54.786
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ON THE

04:08:54.853 --> 04:08:56.955
MEDI CAL SIDE WE HAD A HEARING

04:08:57.022 --> 04:08:57.989
ON IMMIGRATION OF CARE AND THERE

04:08:58.056 --> 04:09:02.961
WAS SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT --

04:09:03.028 --> 04:09:04.129
THING THAT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT

04:09:04.195 --> 04:09:05.930
SAMPLE ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE

04:09:05.997 --> 04:09:08.466
AND THE MEDIC OUTSIDE TRYING

04:09:08.533 --> 04:09:08.767
[inaudible]

04:09:08.833 --> 04:09:13.605
TO A LINE -- RIGHT AS SO THAT.

04:09:13.672 --> 04:09:14.639
SO WHILE WE DO HAVE I THINK WE

04:09:14.706 --> 04:09:15.340
DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

04:09:15.407 --> 04:09:17.142
SEGREGATION AND THE NATURE OF

04:09:17.208 --> 04:09:19.010
PROVIDERS TO BE -- GIVEN THAT

04:09:19.077 --> 04:09:20.545
OUR LOW REIMBURSEMENT SO FORTY

04:09:20.612 --> 04:09:21.680
SEND TEND TO HAVE LIKE THIS

04:09:21.746 --> 04:09:22.847
GROUP DOES MEDI CAL THAT GROUP I

04:09:22.914 --> 04:09:25.250
MEAN THERE ARE MANY WHO DO BOTH.

04:09:25.317 --> 04:09:27.886
AND AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO

04:09:27.952 --> 04:09:28.520
GET TO THAT WHAT CAUGHT TIPPING

04:09:28.586 --> 04:09:29.954
POINT CHANGING BEHAVIOR AND

04:09:30.021 --> 04:09:31.589
SOMEONE'S PRACTICE.

04:09:31.656 --> 04:09:33.491
IT'S GOOD IF YOU KNOW EVERY

04:09:33.558 --> 04:09:35.760
PAYER ARE ALMOST ALL THE PLAYERS

04:09:35.827 --> 04:09:37.429
ENOUGH PAIRS OF THEIR PRACTICE

04:09:37.495 --> 04:09:40.799
ALL WANT THE SAME THING BECAUSE

04:09:40.865 --> 04:09:41.800
I'LL TELL YOU AS A PHYSICIAN IF.

04:09:41.866 --> 04:09:44.302
NO ONE CARES LIKE 20% OF MY

04:09:44.369 --> 04:09:45.737
PRACTICE AS A DO AX.

04:09:45.804 --> 04:09:48.273
AND OTHER ONE IS 15% READ THOSE

04:09:48.340 --> 04:09:53.511
WHY A AND THE OTHER ONES IS THE

04:09:53.578 --> 04:09:55.980
YOU KNOW THE YOU CAN GO ALL

04:09:56.047 --> 04:09:58.350
RIGHT WELL THAT'S GREAT EXCEPT.

04:09:58.416 --> 04:10:00.151
NO I TO MAKE THE CHANGE ACROSS

04:10:00.218 --> 04:10:01.119
OUR PRACTICE IS NOT LIKE I GO

04:10:01.186 --> 04:10:01.886
LOOK AT INSURANCE CARDS ALONG A

04:10:01.953 --> 04:10:03.288
TREAT THIS PERSON THIS WAY AND

04:10:03.355 --> 04:10:04.522
THAT ONE THAT WAY RATES THAT'S

04:10:04.589 --> 04:10:05.523
THE SYSTEM YOU PUT IN PLACE YOUR

04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:07.092
PRACTICE YOU KNOW YOUR NURSES

04:10:07.158 --> 04:10:09.761

04:10:09.828 --> 04:10:10.495
HOW AND WE DO.

04:10:10.562 --> 04:10:15.100
CORPORATION CARE AROUND WHICH

04:10:15.166 --> 04:10:18.636
DISEASES AND LIKE A CELL.

04:10:18.703 --> 04:10:19.838
ALSO -- WHEN THINGS I'M HOPING

04:10:19.904 --> 04:10:20.939
THAT AS THIS IS DEVELOPED TO

04:10:21.005 --> 04:10:21.773
THINK ABOUT IT WE HAVE SOME

04:10:21.840 --> 04:10:22.340
OPPORTUNITIES ALSO ON THE

04:10:22.407 --> 04:10:23.141
COMMERCIAL SIDE GIVING THE FACT

04:10:23.208 --> 04:10:23.641
THAT YOU KNOW WE PAY FOR

04:10:23.708 --> 04:10:24.843
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE FOR CALPERS

04:10:24.909 --> 04:10:26.444
AND WE HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA

04:10:26.511 --> 04:10:29.447
SO? FOR TO TO TO BUILD ON THIS

04:10:29.514 --> 04:10:31.383
AND THINK ABOUT HOW.

04:10:31.449 --> 04:10:32.384
WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOU

04:10:32.450 --> 04:10:33.952
KNOW SO APPRECIATE YOU HAVE THIS

04:10:34.018 --> 04:10:35.653
PROPOSAL HERE AND THAT.

04:10:35.720 --> 04:10:36.654
SAYING THAT OKAY WELL SUPPOSE

04:10:36.721 --> 04:10:37.489
HAVING SOME DISCUSSIONS SAYING

04:10:37.555 --> 04:10:38.757
OKAY LET'S HAVE SOME COMMERCIAL

04:10:38.823 --> 04:10:39.824
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT DOING THE

04:10:39.891 --> 04:10:41.326
SAME THING AND SEE HOW WE CAN

04:10:41.393 --> 04:10:42.060
COORDINATE.

04:10:42.127 --> 04:10:43.194
SO BASICALLY YOU'RE GETTING THE

04:10:43.261 --> 04:10:44.963
SAME SIGNAL THAT'S GOING OUT TO

04:10:45.029 --> 04:10:46.531
THE REVISED HERS AROUND THESE

04:10:46.598 --> 04:10:48.533
PARTICULAR AREAS RIGHT OKAY.

04:10:48.600 --> 04:10:50.368
SO THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT ISN'T

04:10:50.435 --> 04:10:51.803
DOES THIS ONE JUST BE FROM THE

04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:52.804
MEDI CAL SIDE FOR THAT MAY BE

04:10:52.871 --> 04:10:55.573
ACROSS BOTH MEDI CAL AND NOW

04:10:55.640 --> 04:10:57.242
THEY'RE MAJOR COMMERCIAL PAYERS

04:10:57.308 --> 04:10:58.042
WE MAY NOT GET ALL THE PLAYERS

04:10:58.109 --> 04:10:59.878
BUT ENOUGH THAT IT'S LIKE OKAY

04:10:59.944 --> 04:11:01.513
WELL THAT'S PLAY THAT'S YOU KNOW

04:11:01.579 --> 04:11:02.147
72% MY PATIENTS.

04:11:02.213 --> 04:11:03.782
FALLEN THAT IT MAKES SENSE FOR

04:11:03.848 --> 04:11:04.716
ME TO NOW CHANGE THE WAY I DO

04:11:04.783 --> 04:11:06.885
THINGS MY PRACTICE -- BECAUSE

04:11:06.951 --> 04:11:08.753
IT'S JUST IT DID HAVE A BIG

04:11:08.820 --> 04:11:09.387
IMPACT.

04:11:09.454 --> 04:11:11.656
SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE

04:11:11.723 --> 04:11:13.625
SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND I'M

04:11:13.691 --> 04:11:16.795
IS SINCE SINCE THAT HEARING --

04:11:16.861 --> 04:11:19.297

04:11:22.367 --> 04:11:22.901
AND COVER CALIFORNIA START ON

04:11:22.967 --> 04:11:23.668
THIS IS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

04:11:23.735 --> 04:11:24.602
VALUE METRICS AND OTHER THINGS.

04:11:24.669 --> 04:11:26.171
<i>OT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THIS</i>

04:11:26.237 --> 04:11:27.839
PROPOSAL BUT I THINK WHAT YOU

04:11:27.906 --> 04:11:28.807

04:11:28.873 --> 04:11:30.241
HEARING LIKE WHAT WHAT QUALITY

04:11:30.308 --> 04:11:31.276
MEASURES ARE WE LOOKING AT HOW

CAN WE HAVE SOME.

04:11:32.777 --> 04:11:33.945
CONSISTENCY WHERE IT MAKES SENSE

04:11:34.012 --> 04:11:35.647
WHEN YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE HAVE

04:11:35.713 --> 04:11:37.182
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS BUT SO

04:11:37.248 --> 04:11:38.616
WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING DOWN THAT

04:11:38.683 --> 04:11:39.884
PATH AS PART OF SORT OF OUR

04:11:39.951 --> 04:11:41.286
FUTURE MEDI CAL PLANNING THAT

04:11:41.352 --> 04:11:42.353
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER SO

04:11:42.420 --> 04:11:43.922
DEFINITELY AGREE THAT WE WANT TO

04:11:43.988 --> 04:11:44.656
TRY.

04:11:44.722 --> 04:11:46.291
TO DO WHAT WE CAN SO THAT WERE

04:11:46.357 --> 04:11:48.159
CHANGING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND

04:11:48.226 --> 04:11:49.527
YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT IF IF

04:11:49.594 --> 04:11:56.167
YOU'RE AFFECTING SORT OF A

04:11:56.234 --> 04:11:58.937
LARGER PERCENT OF THE POPULATION.

04:11:59.003 --> 04:11:59.137

04:13:01.966 --> 04:13:04.335
CALIFORNIANS ARE PRE DIABETIC

04:13:04.402 --> 04:13:05.336

TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES --

04:14:05.730 --> 04:14:14.939
THAT'S FROM THE CALIFORNIA TO

IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES -- THE

04:14:16.941 --> 04:14:18.042
AREAS FOCUSED ON PRE AND

04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:19.844
POSTNATAL CARE CHRONIC DISEASES

04:14:19.911 --> 04:14:21.779
AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE AREAS

04:14:21.846 --> 04:14:24.015
WITH -- PERSISTENT AND WELL

04:14:24.082 --> 04:14:26.084
DOCUMENTED DISPARITIES -- WE

04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:27.452
ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT --

04:14:27.518 --> 04:14:29.687
SIMILARLY TO CONSULT WITH COVER

04:14:29.754 --> 04:14:33.257
CALIFORNIA OTHER PAIRS AND WE

04:14:33.324 --> 04:14:34.359
KNOW THAT MEDICARE AT THAT --

04:14:34.425 --> 04:14:37.895
CMS JUST UPDATED THEIR VALUE

04:14:37.962 --> 04:14:42.166
BASED PAYMENT -- PROPOSALS WHILE --

04:14:42.233 --> 04:14:43.101
AS A WHOLE SYSTEM MOVES TOWARD

04:14:43.167 --> 04:14:44.402
VALUE BASED PAYMENT WE NEED

04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:46.471
PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ACCESS

04:14:46.537 --> 04:14:47.271
AND MONITOR DISPARITIES IN

04:14:47.338 --> 04:14:49.507
HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES.

04:14:49.574 --> 04:14:50.975
A RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

04:14:51.042 --> 04:14:52.276
FAILURE TO PRIORITIZE HEALTH

04:14:52.343 --> 04:14:54.479
EQUITY IN EMERGING KERR MODELS

04:14:54.545 --> 04:14:56.147
ACTUALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

04:14:56.214 --> 04:14:57.949
EXACERBATE THEM.

04:14:58.016 --> 04:14:59.584

PAYMENT PROGRAM THAT PRIORITIZES

04:15:05.123 --> 04:15:06.658
THE REDUCTION OF DISPARITIES --

04:15:06.724 --> 04:15:08.092
AND THE DH CS CONSULT WITH A

04:15:08.159 --> 04:15:09.927
BROAD SET OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THE

04:15:09.994 --> 04:15:12.797
MECHANICS OF THE PROPOSAL -- THE

METRICS AT WE WE PROVIDE A

04:15:14.666 --> 04:15:15.900
COMMENTS ON THE METRICS AND I

04:15:15.967 --> 04:15:18.236
THINK THE METRICS THEMSELVES ARE

04:15:18.302 --> 04:15:19.737

PROPOSED THOUGH -- THAT THERE'S

04:15:24.475 --> 04:15:26.411
A FAILURE TO CLEARLY STATE THE

04:15:26.477 --> 04:15:28.179
DISPARITIES REDUCTION IS A GOAL

04:15:28.246 --> 04:15:29.914
TO TIE PAYMENTS EXPLICITLY TO

04:15:29.981 --> 04:15:31.049

THERE'S ALSO AN IMPORT.

04:15:42.160 --> 04:15:43.161
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY

04:15:43.227 --> 04:15:44.028
TO ENSURE THAT -- MANAGED CARE

04:15:44.095 --> 04:15:45.596

YOU KNOW PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

04:15:55.606 --> 04:15:57.241
WOULD ADD ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES

04:15:57.308 --> 04:15:58.409
TO STRENGTHEN THE COLLECTION AND

04:15:58.476 --> 04:15:59.444
REPORTING.

EHR CERTIFICATION AMONGST OTHER

04:16:29.707 --> 04:16:32.043
OF PROPOSALS -- THAT WE THINK

04:16:32.110 --> 04:16:33.745
WOULD HELP TO STRENGTHEN --

04:16:33.811 --> 04:16:36.180

WEEKEND APPOINTMENTS AT CETERA --

04:16:40.284 --> 04:16:42.553
YOU KNOW THIS IS A I THINK THIS

04:16:42.620 --> 04:16:43.588
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

04:16:43.654 --> 04:16:45.356
OPPORTUNITY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

04:16:45.423 --> 04:16:47.058
TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND

04:16:47.125 --> 04:16:48.993
REDUCE DISPARITIES BUT ONLY IF

04:16:49.060 --> 04:16:50.928
WE MAKE THE THAT COMMITMENT

04:16:50.995 --> 04:16:53.264
EXPLICIT -- SO WE REALLY URGE

04:16:53.331 --> 04:16:54.899
THE DEPARTMENT TO PRIORITIZE --

04:16:54.966 --> 04:16:59.570
DESPAIRS REDUCTION AS A GOAL AS

04:16:59.637 --> 04:17:01.372
PART OF THIS PROGRAM.

04:17:01.439 --> 04:17:02.940
THANK.

04:17:03.007 --> 04:17:03.608
YOU COMMENTS FROM THE EIGHTY S..

04:17:03.674 --> 04:17:04.275
I THINK THE ONLY COMMENT I HAVE

04:17:04.342 --> 04:17:05.343
I THINK IT GOES BACK TO MY PRIOR

04:17:05.409 --> 04:17:07.411
STATEMENT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

04:17:07.478 --> 04:17:09.247
OF THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF VALUE

04:17:09.313 --> 04:17:10.581
BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM BEING AT A

04:17:10.648 --> 04:17:11.849
PROVIDER LEVEL.

04:17:11.916 --> 04:17:13.251
AND SO THE KINDS OF DATA THAT

04:17:13.317 --> 04:17:14.952
YOU HAVE AVAILABLE I THINK WE

04:17:15.019 --> 04:17:17.088
SHARED THAT THE DESIRE TO REDUCE

04:17:17.155 --> 04:17:18.956
DISPARITIES I I THINK WE

04:17:19.023 --> 04:17:20.491
STRUGGLED WITH HOW COULD WE

04:17:20.558 --> 04:17:21.726
ADDRESS THAT.

04:17:21.793 --> 04:17:23.027
IN THE TYPE OF STRUCTURE THAT

04:17:23.094 --> 04:17:25.496
THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AND SO --

04:17:25.563 --> 04:17:26.864
I KNOW WE DID RECEIVE COMMENTS

04:17:26.931 --> 04:17:28.533
OR OR STILL GOING THROUGH THOSE

04:17:28.599 --> 04:17:29.600
BUT I JUST WANTED TO FLAG IT'S

04:17:29.667 --> 04:17:31.169
NOT THAT IT'S NOT A PRIORITY

04:17:31.235 --> 04:17:33.638
IT'S CAN YOU ACTUALLY DO IT AND

04:17:33.704 --> 04:17:35.306
THAT YOU KNOW DATA AS YOU KNOW

04:17:35.373 --> 04:17:37.542
CAN BE CHALLENGING -- AND AS

04:17:37.608 --> 04:17:39.343
IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW THE DATA

04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:41.012
COLLECTION THAT WE SO OUR RACE

04:17:41.078 --> 04:17:43.080
ETHNICITY DATA TODAY AND MEET IN

04:17:43.147 --> 04:17:44.415
AND IT HAS TO BE OPTIONAL.

04:17:44.482 --> 04:17:45.650
AS OURS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

04:17:45.716 --> 04:17:46.584
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS LIKE

04:17:46.651 --> 04:17:48.553
THAT AND SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY

04:17:48.619 --> 04:17:50.988
ALSO HAVE THAT INFORMATION --

04:17:51.055 --> 04:17:52.323
FOR A WIDE.

04:17:52.390 --> 04:17:53.658
PERCENTAGE THERE I THINK WE'RE

04:17:53.724 --> 04:17:56.160
LIKE AT 20% A KNOWN OR OTHER IN

04:17:56.227 --> 04:17:57.195
GENERAL IN OUR MEDICAL

04:17:57.261 --> 04:17:58.496
ELIGIBILITY DATA SO.

04:17:58.563 --> 04:18:00.031
AGAIN TOTALLY APPRECIATE AND

04:18:00.097 --> 04:18:01.999
AGREE THAT THAT IS A GOAL BUT

04:18:02.066 --> 04:18:04.302
HOW I THINK WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW

04:18:04.368 --> 04:18:09.006
DO WE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT

04:18:09.073 --> 04:18:09.807
IN A STRUCTURE LIKE THIS

04:18:09.874 --> 04:18:10.107
[inaudible]

04:18:10.174 --> 04:18:11.709
OKAY.

04:18:11.776 --> 04:18:15.379
HELLO ANY COMMENTS FINANCE.

04:18:15.446 --> 04:18:16.380
OKAY -- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT --

04:18:16.447 --> 04:18:20.284
THE PROPOSAL AND SHARED GOALS IS

04:18:20.351 --> 04:18:21.652
CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO -- HAS

04:18:21.719 --> 04:18:23.120
BEEN FIGHTING ABOUT TRYING TO

04:18:23.187 --> 04:18:26.657
DRESS -- DISPARITIES IN -- AND

04:18:26.724 --> 04:18:28.226
THAT SHE FOR THE API COMMUNITY

04:18:28.292 --> 04:18:29.894
TRYING TO ACTUALLY DISAGGREGATED

04:18:29.961 --> 04:18:31.796
SO SHE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

04:18:31.863 --> 04:18:32.296
TODAY DOING ANY OF THAT

04:18:32.363 --> 04:18:35.366
INFORMATION -- BUT ALSO REACT --

04:18:35.433 --> 04:18:37.435
RECOGNIZING UM AS SOMEONE WHO'S

04:18:37.501 --> 04:18:39.136
THAT PRACTICE SPACE RESEARCH SO

04:18:39.203 --> 04:18:43.541
OKAY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT

04:18:43.608 --> 04:18:44.242
THE PROVIDER LEVEL.

04:18:44.308 --> 04:18:44.876
THE KINDS OF INFORMATION SO WE

04:18:44.942 --> 04:18:46.844
CAN CERTAINLY HAVE THE OFFICES

04:18:46.911 --> 04:18:48.913
ASK INFORMATION LIKE YOU KNOW

04:18:48.980 --> 04:18:49.881
WHAT YOUR RATES AND AND AND SO

04:18:49.947 --> 04:18:50.848
FORTH.

04:18:50.915 --> 04:18:51.883
WE CAN'T COMPEL SOMEONE ANSWER

04:18:51.949 --> 04:18:53.284
IT IS GONNA BE SELF IDENTIFIED

04:18:53.351 --> 04:18:56.087
SO WHEN WE WE THERE ARE ELEMENTS

04:18:56.153 --> 04:18:58.489
TO DO THAT -- BUT IT'S PROBABLY

04:18:58.556 --> 04:19:01.592
NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS NEAT

04:19:01.659 --> 04:19:02.760
CLEAN AS PEOPLE EXPECT WILL BE

04:19:02.827 --> 04:19:04.929
AT MIGHT BE PRETTY FUZZY AND

04:19:04.996 --> 04:19:06.130
DEPENDING ON IT I THINK WHEN YOU

04:19:06.197 --> 04:19:07.298
AGGREGATE EVERYONE YOU MAY GO

04:19:07.365 --> 04:19:10.101
GET A BETTER IDEA BUT IT CAN BE

04:19:10.167 --> 04:19:12.670
HARD -- TO FOR PARTICULAR SO AS

04:19:12.737 --> 04:19:13.838
YOU GET DOWN TO A PARTICULAR

04:19:13.905 --> 04:19:15.139
POSITION AT SEA ON THIS BENT ON

04:19:15.206 --> 04:19:16.974
THE PATIENT BASE RIGHT -- AIDS

04:19:17.041 --> 04:19:17.675
IS THAT IT YEAH SAID TYPICAL

04:19:17.742 --> 04:19:19.911
PRICE YOUR PHYSICIAN ABOUT

04:19:19.977 --> 04:19:20.478
FIFTEEN HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND

04:19:20.544 --> 04:19:22.280
PATIENTS -- THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS

04:19:22.346 --> 04:19:23.180
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE MEASURES

04:19:23.247 --> 04:19:24.649
IF YOUR PEDIATRICIAN AND YOU'RE

04:19:24.715 --> 04:19:25.483
LOOKING AT WELL CHILD WILL.

04:19:25.549 --> 04:19:27.551
THAT COVERS A GOOD PORTION OF

04:19:27.618 --> 04:19:28.452
THEM BUT THEN YOU'RE TALKING

04:19:28.519 --> 04:19:33.224
ABOUT THE DIABETICS THAT'S A

04:19:33.291 --> 04:19:34.825
FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER AND SO --

04:19:34.892 --> 04:19:35.459
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN'T DO

04:19:35.526 --> 04:19:36.060
ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I THINK

04:19:36.127 --> 04:19:37.795
THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW WE WANT

04:19:37.862 --> 04:19:41.532
TO TRY TO REDUCE -- THE SPIRIT

04:19:41.599 --> 04:19:42.934
IS THE THING IS IS THAT YOU HAVE

04:19:43.000 --> 04:19:45.436
A HANDFUL OF PATIENCE.

04:19:45.503 --> 04:19:46.971
HOW DO YOU DO THAT ON A SENTENCE

04:19:47.038 --> 04:19:50.441
OF SIDE -- FOR THAT PARTICULAR

04:19:50.508 --> 04:19:51.742
DIE YOU CAN TRY TO DO AN

04:19:51.809 --> 04:19:54.578
AGGREGATE BUT THAT'S MORE AT THE

04:19:54.645 --> 04:19:55.846
HEALTH PLAN -- MEDICAL GROUP

04:19:55.913 --> 04:19:57.615
LEVEL.

04:19:57.682 --> 04:20:00.818
AND SO -- BUT I THINK WE SHOULD

04:20:00.885 --> 04:20:01.585
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FIGURE OUT

04:20:01.652 --> 04:20:02.153
HOW.

04:20:02.219 --> 04:20:03.888
TO CHIP CHIP AWAY AT THAT MAYBE

04:20:03.955 --> 04:20:05.656
OVER TIME YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET

04:20:05.723 --> 04:20:07.158
MORE SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE POINT

04:20:07.224 --> 04:20:08.459
OF TIME WITH NUMBERS OF PATIENTS

04:20:08.526 --> 04:20:09.927
OVER TIME YOU MAY BE ABLE TO

04:20:09.994 --> 04:20:11.829
FIND SOME WAYS TO LOOK AT SOME

04:20:11.896 --> 04:20:12.930
OF THESE THINGS.

04:20:12.997 --> 04:20:15.166
AS WELL AND I CERTAINLY THINK --

04:20:15.232 --> 04:20:16.634
ONE THING WE CAN BE COMMITTED TO

04:20:16.701 --> 04:20:18.069
YOU IS BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE

04:20:18.135 --> 04:20:20.638
DO HAVE A VALUE WAIT.

04:20:20.705 --> 04:20:21.806
THEN THE RESULTS AT THE

04:20:21.872 --> 04:20:24.508
AGGREGATE LEVEL TO SEE YOU KNOW

04:20:24.575 --> 04:20:26.243
NOT ONLY AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL

04:20:26.310 --> 04:20:28.145
BUT YOU KNOW NOT AGGREGATE TOTAL

04:20:28.212 --> 04:20:29.613
POPULATION BUT AGGREGATE BUT

04:20:29.680 --> 04:20:31.182
BREAKING BROKE BROKEN DOWN BY

04:20:31.248 --> 04:20:32.950
THE POPULATION INFORMATION THAT

04:20:33.017 --> 04:20:34.452
WE HAVE. TO SEE WHAT EFFECT IT

04:20:34.518 --> 04:20:35.853
DID HAVE WHAT WAS THERE A

04:20:35.920 --> 04:20:38.289
DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT IT OVERALL

04:20:38.356 --> 04:20:40.191
AGAIN NOT OUT THE PHYSICIAN.

04:20:40.257 --> 04:20:41.325
LEVEL BECAUSE AGAIN THE NUMBER

04:20:41.392 --> 04:20:43.294
OF PATIENTS AND ALL OF THAT SO I

04:20:43.361 --> 04:20:44.562
THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE THING

04:20:44.628 --> 04:20:46.130
WILL WILL BE LOOKING AT AND

04:20:46.197 --> 04:20:46.797
THINKING ABOUT FOR THE

04:20:46.864 --> 04:20:48.399
EVALUATION COMPONENT OF THE

04:20:48.466 --> 04:20:50.468
VALUE BASED. TO AT LEAST SEE IF

04:20:50.534 --> 04:20:52.636
IT IF IT DID HAVE DIFFERENTIAL

04:20:52.703 --> 04:20:54.005
IMPACTS AND IF SO THAT MAY BE

04:20:54.071 --> 04:20:55.606
THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW IN THE

04:20:55.673 --> 04:20:57.074
FUTURE AS WE LOOK AT STUFF IT

04:20:57.141 --> 04:20:58.676
ARE THERE OTHERS OTHER THINGS WE

04:20:58.743 --> 04:21:00.711
SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AS WE LOOK

04:21:00.778 --> 04:21:01.746
AT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

04:21:01.812 --> 04:21:03.748
PHOTO LOG THE OTHER LEVEL THAT

04:21:03.814 --> 04:21:05.116
WAS ALSO RECRUITMENT SWITCH.

04:21:05.182 --> 04:21:06.984
WHO'S PARTICIPATING IN WHICH

04:21:07.051 --> 04:21:08.486
COMMUNITIES -- AND RIGHT.

04:21:08.552 --> 04:21:13.524
BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

04:21:13.591 --> 04:21:15.893
TALKING ABOUT.

04:21:15.960 --> 04:21:17.395
OVERSTOCK OTHER ANTI GOT ABOUT

04:21:17.461 --> 04:21:19.330
THIS FOR WAY TOO LONG.

04:21:19.397 --> 04:21:20.898
BUT SO ANYWAY ONE OF THE REASONS

04:21:20.965 --> 04:21:21.432
WHY I THINK WE US ALSO FOR

04:21:21.499 --> 04:21:22.633
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO BECAUSE

04:21:22.700 --> 04:21:24.201
AS AS WE CANSEE JUST HERE

04:21:24.268 --> 04:21:25.669
THERE'S THERE'S A LOT MORE

04:21:25.736 --> 04:21:27.304
UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE AS WE

04:21:27.371 --> 04:21:28.506
TALK ABOUT THE SENATE.

04:21:28.572 --> 04:21:30.274
WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT IT

04:21:30.341 --> 04:21:33.811
THIS IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION

04:21:33.878 --> 04:21:35.780
TO MEASURE AND APPRECIATE THAT

04:21:35.846 --> 04:21:37.615
WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS SO I

04:21:37.681 --> 04:21:38.115
THINK.

04:21:38.182 --> 04:21:39.683
YOU KNOW FOR FOR FROM OUR

04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:41.218
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD

04:21:41.285 --> 04:21:42.453
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT

04:21:42.520 --> 04:21:43.821
CONVERSATION AND REALLY.

04:21:43.888 --> 04:21:45.056
FIGURE OUT HOW HOW WE CAN DO

04:21:45.122 --> 04:21:46.590
THIS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE

04:21:46.657 --> 04:21:48.659
PARTS THAT NOTE TO GET TO WHAT

04:21:48.726 --> 04:21:49.326
YOU'RE.

04:21:49.393 --> 04:21:51.128
TALKING ABOUT IS IS ACTUALLY IT

04:21:51.195 --> 04:21:53.030
IS GOING TO BE PROVIDER.

04:21:53.097 --> 04:21:55.299
GROUPS INVOLVEMENT WHICH ONES

04:21:55.366 --> 04:21:57.268
ARE IN PART OF THE VALUE EIGHT

04:21:57.334 --> 04:21:58.135
SO.

04:21:58.202 --> 04:22:00.504
SO BECAUSE INHERENTLY WE MAY NOT

04:22:00.571 --> 04:22:02.506
BE A MEASURE ON THE MEL TO GIVEN

04:22:02.573 --> 04:22:03.374
THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PER

04:22:03.441 --> 04:22:04.875
PHYSICIAN BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S

04:22:04.942 --> 04:22:06.377
CERTAIN POSITIONS OF A VERY HIGH

04:22:06.444 --> 04:22:07.678
PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS IN

04:22:07.745 --> 04:22:09.213
DIFFERENT.

04:22:09.280 --> 04:22:10.681
YELL AT THE GROUP'S DIFFERENT

04:22:10.748 --> 04:22:12.583
SOCIOECONOMIC CLASSES AND SO YOU

04:22:12.650 --> 04:22:13.250
DON'T WANT TO DO IS YOU GO BACK

04:22:13.317 --> 04:22:15.052
I HAVE A VALUE BASED PACE AND

04:22:15.119 --> 04:22:17.822
SAVE SYSTEM AND ALL THE YOU KNOW.

04:22:17.888 --> 04:22:19.924
90% OR 80% OF THEM ALL PRACTICE

04:22:19.990 --> 04:22:21.959
IN THEM YOU KNOW HELLO THIS IS

04:22:22.026 --> 04:22:23.260
NETTA CAL BUT YOU KNOW THERE.

04:22:23.327 --> 04:22:24.462
ARE CERTAIN THERE BUT THERE ARE

04:22:24.528 --> 04:22:25.696
CERTAIN PARTS OF YOU KNOW

04:22:25.763 --> 04:22:27.098
CERTAIN RIGHT AND THAT AND YOU

04:22:27.164 --> 04:22:29.066
KNOW ALL THE ONES WHO ARE TO YOU

04:22:29.133 --> 04:22:30.334
KNOW ALL THE ONES ARE TAKING A

04:22:30.401 --> 04:22:32.403
KERIO WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITIES

04:22:32.470 --> 04:22:33.370
THAT ARE.

04:22:33.437 --> 04:22:35.072
YOU KNOW HIGHLY -- NOW AFTER

04:22:35.139 --> 04:22:36.474
AMERICAN OR SOMETHING ARE

04:22:36.540 --> 04:22:39.844
PARTICIPATING OUR OR OR AREN'T

04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:41.479
PERFORMING.

04:22:41.545 --> 04:22:42.279
LET'S SAY THAT'S THE OTHER THING

04:22:42.346 --> 04:22:44.782
TO BE INCLUDED BUT THEIR QUOTE

04:22:44.849 --> 04:22:45.950
NOT PERFORMING IN.

04:22:46.016 --> 04:22:51.622
YUP THINK LIKE -- WHAT'S GOING

04:22:51.689 --> 04:22:52.289
ON IT IS IT.

04:22:52.356 --> 04:22:53.524
IS IT THE WAY WE STRUCTURED THIS

04:22:53.591 --> 04:22:54.592
IS IT YOU KNOW WHAT CELL BECAUSE

04:22:54.658 --> 04:22:55.059
THAT THAT'S WHERE THE

04:22:55.126 --> 04:22:55.960
DISPARITIES MAY SHOW UP TO WE

04:22:56.026 --> 04:22:56.994
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

04:22:57.061 --> 04:22:59.864
DIFFERENCES IN ADOPTION OF EHR

04:22:59.930 --> 04:23:01.932
TECHNOLOGY PARTICULARLY FOR YOU

04:23:01.999 --> 04:23:02.833
KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GETTING TO THE

COLLECTED AS WELL IN TERMS OF

04:32:48.985 --> 04:32:50.921

KIND OF SENSE.

04:33:00.731 --> 04:33:01.732
BUT WE THINK THERE'S A TON OF

04:33:01.798 --> 04:33:03.133
POTENTIAL IF WE WERE TO

04:33:03.200 --> 04:33:05.235

04:33:08.438 --> 04:33:10.140
DISPARITIES REDUCTION THAT WE

04:33:10.207 --> 04:33:10.974

04:33:11.041 --> 04:33:12.542
KIND OF DO BOTH THINGS WE COULD

04:33:12.609 --> 04:33:14.010
WE COULD GET THE DATA WE NEED

04:33:14.077 --> 04:33:15.178
AND THEN START TO DRIVE FOR

04:33:15.245 --> 04:33:16.947
MEANINGFUL CHANGE THIS IS REALLY

04:33:17.013 --> 04:33:18.248
ABOUT MOVING FROM THE TRIPLE

04:33:18.315 --> 04:33:21.118

SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT THEY

04:33:29.426 --> 04:33:33.563
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE OF

04:33:33.630 --> 04:33:33.930
COLOR TO DO IT.

04:33:33.997 --> 04:33:35.265
WE HAVE AN OVER REPRESENTATION

04:33:35.332 --> 04:33:36.032

04:33:38.301 --> 04:33:40.337

04:33:40.403 --> 04:33:42.372
COULD DO POTENTIALLY TO TO TRY

04:33:42.439 --> 04:33:44.040
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WORKING AND

04:33:44.107 --> 04:33:46.209
WHAT'S NOT BUT IS IS IS

04:33:46.276 --> 04:33:47.477
IMPORTANT AND IT'S EVEN MORE

04:33:47.544 --> 04:33:48.378

COLOR AND SO WE THINK IT'S WORTH.

04:33:51.948 --> 04:33:54.351
THE EFFORT TO TRY TO TAKE IT TO

04:33:54.417 --> 04:33:55.352

SOMETHING THAT'S IT YOU KNOW.

04:38:32.762 --> 04:38:33.530
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

SERVICES THAT THEY NEED.

04:38:55.285 --> 04:38:56.386
BUT WE DO THINK THIS IS AN

04:38:56.453 --> 04:38:58.254
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN ORDER

04:38:58.321 --> 04:39:00.223
FOR US TO IDENTIFY WHAT WHAT

SCREENING SOME OF THESE WILL

04:39:15.138 --> 04:39:16.873
ALSO APPLY TO THE TRAUMA STRUM

RESEARCHERS ACROSS THE STATE --

04:39:58.515 --> 04:39:59.849
THE LACK OF DEVELOPMENTAL

04:40:01.718 --> 04:40:03.553
PRIMARY REASON WHY WE'RE NOT

04:40:03.620 --> 04:40:05.088
SERVING ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN.

04:40:05.155 --> 04:40:06.956
AMONG THE REASONS THAT WE

WE SHOULD BE THINKING AS PART OF

04:42:10.446 --> 04:42:13.249
GOING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT NEED --

04:42:13.316 --> 04:42:15.585
LIKELIHOOD IS THAT IF WE DID

04:42:15.652 --> 04:42:17.086
IDENTIFY AND SERVE ALL CHILDREN

04:42:17.153 --> 04:42:21.124
THAT ASSOCIATED COSTS ON THE DDS

04:42:21.190 --> 04:42:22.292
SIDE OF THE BUDGET.

04:42:22.358 --> 04:42:23.626
WHO WOULD INCREASE BY HUNDREDS

04:42:23.693 --> 04:42:24.894
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT'S

04:42:24.961 --> 04:42:26.429
NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

04:42:26.496 --> 04:42:27.563
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET?

04:42:27.630 --> 04:42:30.066
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW

04:42:30.133 --> 04:42:31.434
WITH THE CURRENT POPULATION WERE

04:42:31.501 --> 04:42:34.003
SERVING OVER EXPERIENCING --

04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:35.905
NOTABLE PROVIDER SHORTAGES

04:42:35.972 --> 04:42:37.407
PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN AREAS OF

04:42:37.473 --> 04:42:38.441
THE STATE.

04:42:38.508 --> 04:42:39.976
IN AN INTERESTING THOSE MIGHT

04:42:40.043 --> 04:42:43.479
REQUIRE SOME UP FRONT --

04:42:43.546 --> 04:42:45.315
EXPENDITURES FROM THE STATE AND

04:42:45.381 --> 04:42:46.816
THOSE COULD EASILY BE WITHIN

04:42:46.883 --> 04:42:49.585
THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

04:42:49.652 --> 04:42:50.320
ON THIS EARTH [inaudible]

04:42:50.386 --> 04:42:52.722
FINANCE [inaudible]

04:42:52.789 --> 04:42:55.525
COMMENTS OKAY.

04:42:55.591 --> 04:42:59.796
WELL -- CERTAINLY -- I AGREE

04:42:59.862 --> 04:43:02.799
THAT -- WE BUY A LOT OF I MEAN

04:43:02.865 --> 04:43:03.599
FOR THE REASON WE'RE PROPOSING

04:43:03.666 --> 04:43:05.635
THAT'S BEING THIS IS BEING

04:43:05.702 --> 04:43:07.437
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND IS

04:43:07.503 --> 04:43:08.938
BECAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY UNDER

04:43:09.005 --> 04:43:12.642
DIAGNOSED SAYING -- AND ANYWAYS

04:43:12.709 --> 04:43:14.243
I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO

04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:17.580
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING.

04:43:17.647 --> 04:43:18.147
IF YOU THINK OF IT ALWAYS

04:43:18.214 --> 04:43:20.316
SERVICE FROM A MORE INFORMAL

04:43:20.383 --> 04:43:21.918
PROCESS.

04:43:21.984 --> 04:43:23.219
AND THEY ALSO THE PEDIATRICIAN

04:43:23.286 --> 04:43:24.687
AND WE HAD THE THE DENVER A

04:43:24.754 --> 04:43:27.557
DENVER TO WHICH ACTUALLY IS. TO

04:43:27.623 --> 04:43:28.925
OKAY IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK AND

04:43:28.991 --> 04:43:30.526
YOUNG A YES NO AND WHAT TIME DID

04:43:30.593 --> 04:43:31.894
YOU WALK IN ROLL OVER AND SO

04:43:31.961 --> 04:43:34.597
FORTH -- TO DOING MORE FORMAL

04:43:34.664 --> 04:43:37.500
MORE VALIDATE SCREENINGS -- AND

04:43:37.567 --> 04:43:39.035
THOSE SCREENINGS ARE MORE

04:43:39.102 --> 04:43:41.904
STRUCTURED -- SOMETIMES THEY MAY

04:43:41.971 --> 04:43:43.272
TAKE MORE TIME.

04:43:43.339 --> 04:43:46.376
AND FRANKLY -- SOME OF THEM AND

04:43:46.442 --> 04:43:47.577
THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT TO THE

04:43:47.643 --> 04:43:49.112
PEOPLE WHO WORKED VERY HARD TO

04:43:49.178 --> 04:43:50.913
DEVELOP THEM AND VALIDATE THEM

04:43:50.980 --> 04:43:51.914
AND SO FORTH SOMETIMES EVEN

04:43:51.981 --> 04:43:53.850
CHARGE MONEY FOR THEM RIGHT

04:43:53.916 --> 04:43:54.417
SOMEONE THAT'S INTELLECTUAL

04:43:54.484 --> 04:43:55.518
PROPERTY.

04:43:55.585 --> 04:43:57.954
RIGHT BUT BUT THE REASON -- SO

04:43:58.020 --> 04:43:59.522
USEFUL BECAUSE SOMEONE TO DO ALL

04:43:59.589 --> 04:44:01.090
THAT WORK TO VALIDATE AND SO

04:44:01.157 --> 04:44:02.792
FORTH AND I THINK AS WE'VE MOVED

04:44:02.859 --> 04:44:04.727
FORWARD IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE

04:44:04.794 --> 04:44:06.229
FOR PEDIATRICIANS AND OTHER

04:44:06.295 --> 04:44:06.763
PHYSICIANS TO TAKE CARE OF

04:44:06.829 --> 04:44:08.498
CHILDREN. TO SAY WELL WE'RE

04:44:08.564 --> 04:44:10.266
GONNA USE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY

04:44:10.333 --> 04:44:11.768
MEANS WHAT IT IS IT'S NOT A

04:44:11.834 --> 04:44:13.703
COMPUTER SOMETHING TECHNOLOGY --

04:44:13.770 --> 04:44:15.071
IT'S COSTING MORE IT'S CAUSING

04:44:15.138 --> 04:44:16.172
MORE TIME IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

04:44:16.239 --> 04:44:17.807
PAY THE LICENSING FEES AND STUFF

04:44:17.874 --> 04:44:19.675
LIKE THAT TO TO USE THESE TOOLS

04:44:19.742 --> 04:44:22.745
AND SO -- I APPRECIATE THAT THE

04:44:22.812 --> 04:44:24.147
GOVERNOR'S PUTTING SOME MORE

04:44:24.213 --> 04:44:26.315
FUNDS INTO THAT SO THAT WE CAN

04:44:26.382 --> 04:44:27.683
ALLOW ALL CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO

04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:29.852
HELP SCREENS NOW THE CONSEQUENCE

04:44:29.919 --> 04:44:31.087
OF THAT IS AN HOUR GOING DOWN TO

04:44:31.154 --> 04:44:31.988
FIND MORE CHILDREN WE ME

04:44:32.054 --> 04:44:33.423
HOPEFULLY WITH THE FIVE MORE

04:44:33.489 --> 04:44:34.991
ACTUALLY.

04:44:35.057 --> 04:44:36.192
TOO AND WHAT YOU DO WITH ALL OF

04:44:36.259 --> 04:44:37.994
THEM RIGHT SO THE PROCESS WE

04:44:38.060 --> 04:44:40.329
HAVE THEN OF THE DRESSING THAT

04:44:40.396 --> 04:44:42.432
YOU KNOW GETTING THEM IN EARLY

04:44:42.498 --> 04:44:43.599
INVENTION TO REGIONAL CENTERS.

04:44:43.666 --> 04:44:45.601
GETTING TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

04:44:45.668 --> 04:44:47.336
BY THE WAY -- SO.

04:44:47.403 --> 04:44:48.404
WE'VE HAD DISCUSSION AROUND

04:44:48.471 --> 04:44:49.972
SPECIAL EDUCATION RIGHT MOST

04:44:50.039 --> 04:44:58.080
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW SPECIAL IT

04:44:58.147 --> 04:44:59.248
STARTS AT THREE YEARS.

04:44:59.315 --> 04:45:00.817
NOT SCHOOL ROMAN THREE YEARS OLD.

04:45:00.883 --> 04:45:01.818
OKAY AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T EVEN

04:45:01.884 --> 04:45:02.385
PAY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR

04:45:02.452 --> 04:45:03.886
THREE YEAR OLDS.

04:45:03.953 --> 04:45:05.688
TELL THOSE IT IS ADDED TO JUST

04:45:05.755 --> 04:45:06.322
GETS ADDED TO THEIR SPECIAL ED

04:45:06.389 --> 04:45:07.256
BUDGET OR SO THAT'S ON THE

04:45:07.323 --> 04:45:08.324
SCHOOL DISTRICT SITE AND THEN

04:45:08.391 --> 04:45:08.858
OUR COURSE OF GOVERNMENTAL

04:45:08.925 --> 04:45:09.158
CENTERS SO.

04:45:09.225 --> 04:45:09.692
CERTAINLY I THINK THAT'S

04:45:09.759 --> 04:45:11.060
SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

04:45:11.127 --> 04:45:12.195
TACKLE I APPRECIATE LA --

04:45:12.261 --> 04:45:13.863
BRINGING THAT UP IT MAY HAVE

04:45:13.930 --> 04:45:17.300
SOME SERIOUS BUDGET --

04:45:17.366 --> 04:45:18.501
IMPLICATIONS BUT AT THE SAME

04:45:18.568 --> 04:45:20.269
TIME I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO SIT

04:45:20.336 --> 04:45:23.639
AND THEN NOT LOOK RIGHT SO YEAH

04:45:23.706 --> 04:45:24.307
BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE SAY WELL

04:45:24.373 --> 04:45:25.575
YOU KNOW WHAT. OH MY GOD YOU

04:45:25.641 --> 04:45:26.976
KNOW SWEDES WON'T LOOK AND THEN

04:45:27.043 --> 04:45:28.711
WE WON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD

04:45:28.778 --> 04:45:29.979
PRETEND LIKE NOTHING'S GOING ON

04:45:30.046 --> 04:45:31.981
AND BUT BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S

04:45:32.048 --> 04:45:34.283
NOT BECAUSE IF IT ISN'T IT.

04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:35.251
SOMETHING IS GOING ON JUST

04:45:35.318 --> 04:45:36.552
HAPPENS WE DIDN'T SEE IT BECAUSE

04:45:36.619 --> 04:45:37.653
WE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK THAT WAY

04:45:37.720 --> 04:45:39.288
AND I THINK I'M NOT SURE THAT'S

04:45:39.355 --> 04:45:41.057
THE RIGHT ANSWER EITHER I KNOW

04:45:41.123 --> 04:45:41.891
THAT SOMEBODY APPLYING I THINK

04:45:41.958 --> 04:45:42.291
YOU'RE.

04:45:42.358 --> 04:45:43.526
YOU'RE JUST GIVING US THAT

04:45:43.593 --> 04:45:45.194
YOU'RE LOOKING AND GIVING US A

04:45:45.261 --> 04:45:46.829
HEADS UP LIKE OKAY THIS IS THE

04:45:46.896 --> 04:45:48.097
IMPLICATION OF THAT AND WE'LL

04:45:48.164 --> 04:45:49.165
WALK INTO THIS.

04:45:49.232 --> 04:45:50.132
AND THEN I THINK YOU KNOW THIS

04:45:50.199 --> 04:45:51.601
LEGISLATION GOVERNOR WILL HAVE

04:45:51.667 --> 04:45:53.302
TO WORK TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT

04:45:53.369 --> 04:45:54.871
HOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

04:45:54.937 --> 04:45:57.039
AND AND TO DO THIS AND MAYBE

04:45:57.106 --> 04:45:58.040
THERE'S A THERE MIGHT BE SOME

04:45:58.107 --> 04:45:59.308
MORE EFFICIENT WAYS OF DOING

04:45:59.375 --> 04:46:00.710
THINGS AS WELL THAT WE CAN LOOK

04:46:00.776 --> 04:46:02.078
INTO ETCETERA.

04:46:02.144 --> 04:46:03.346
BUT I THINK WE FIRST GOT TO KNOW

04:46:03.412 --> 04:46:04.347
WHAT THE FIND THE SIZE OF THE

04:46:04.413 --> 04:46:05.982
PROBLEM FIRST AND WITH THAT WE

04:46:06.048 --> 04:46:06.949
NEED TO MEASURE IT AND I

04:46:07.016 --> 04:46:08.017
APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR

04:46:08.084 --> 04:46:09.752
PROPOSING THAT WE ACTUALLY --

04:46:09.819 --> 04:46:12.421
THAT IF I MEASURE -- FOR THIS IS

04:46:12.488 --> 04:46:14.023
AS IMPORTANT FIRST STEP YES.

04:46:14.090 --> 04:46:15.224
YEAH AND WE DO APPLIED THAT

04:46:15.291 --> 04:46:17.360
EFFORT -- TO TO DO BETTER AND

04:46:17.426 --> 04:46:19.095
IDENTIFYING A ONE OF ONE OF THE

04:46:19.161 --> 04:46:20.096
ISSUES THAT DOES ARISE THROUGH A

04:46:20.162 --> 04:46:21.497
MANAGED CARE PLANS AS WE DON'T

04:46:21.564 --> 04:46:22.999
WE DON'T PAY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

04:46:23.065 --> 04:46:24.367
SCREENING AND LIKE WE WOULD IN

04:46:24.433 --> 04:46:25.635
THE FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT

04:46:25.701 --> 04:46:28.104
AND THAT RESULTS IN DATA GAPS IN.

04:46:28.170 --> 04:46:29.639
IN THE NUMBER SCREENINGS THAT

04:46:29.705 --> 04:46:30.740
ARE ULTIMATELY REPORTED WE

04:46:30.806 --> 04:46:32.275
WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO

04:46:32.341 --> 04:46:33.543
TRY TO UNDERSTAND TO WHAT EXTENT

04:46:33.609 --> 04:46:34.644
ARE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS

04:46:34.710 --> 04:46:36.646
OCCURRING TODAY AND I DON'T

04:46:36.712 --> 04:46:38.247
THINK THAT THEY HAD GOOD DATA.

04:46:38.314 --> 04:46:39.482
THAT COULD ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT

04:46:39.549 --> 04:46:41.050
QUESTION SO WE HAVE A WE DON'T

04:46:41.117 --> 04:46:42.818
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE

04:46:42.885 --> 04:46:44.987
CURRENTLY SCREENING 50% OF KIDS

04:46:45.054 --> 04:46:47.423
90% OF KIDS AND SO FORTH.

04:46:47.490 --> 04:46:49.659
SO IT IT IS A IT IS A PROBLEM

04:46:49.725 --> 04:46:51.360
HOWEVER I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

04:46:51.427 --> 04:46:53.596
THE THE EXPANSION IN THE

04:46:53.663 --> 04:46:54.830
OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED CARE

04:46:54.897 --> 04:46:57.600
INCLUDES A SPECIFIC -- DATA

04:46:57.667 --> 04:46:59.335
MEASURE ON APPROPRIATE

04:46:59.402 --> 04:47:00.503
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS

04:47:00.570 --> 04:47:03.339
OCCURRING BY AGE THREE SO AND TO

04:47:03.406 --> 04:47:04.407
THE EXTENT THAT MANAGED CARE

04:47:04.473 --> 04:47:06.175
PLANS WOULD NOT MEET THAT --

04:47:06.242 --> 04:47:07.743
THEY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CAP --

04:47:07.810 --> 04:47:09.045
TO A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OR

04:47:09.111 --> 04:47:10.813
SANCTIONS SO WE DO THINK THAT

04:47:10.880 --> 04:47:13.182
THERE ARE -- ADDITIONAL EFFORTS

04:47:13.249 --> 04:47:14.216
THAT ARE OCCURRING THAT COULD

04:47:14.283 --> 04:47:20.690
SOLVE THIS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE A

04:47:20.756 --> 04:47:22.959
COST OF OF MANNER.

04:47:23.025 --> 04:47:24.026
THANK YOU AND I WOULD MAKE A

04:47:24.093 --> 04:47:26.095
NOTE -- THAT I WOULD THINK THAT --

04:47:26.162 --> 04:47:27.096
FOR THIS PAYMENT -- WE NEED TO

04:47:27.163 --> 04:47:28.931
HAVE FAIRLY WELL DEFINED

04:47:28.998 --> 04:47:30.533
CRITERIA SO THE PROBLEM IS WE

04:47:30.600 --> 04:47:31.200
SAVE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

04:47:31.267 --> 04:47:32.568
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE BEING

04:47:32.635 --> 04:47:33.102
SCREEN I'LL TELL YOU THE

04:47:33.169 --> 04:47:33.903
QUESTION.

04:47:33.970 --> 04:47:35.638
THE REAL QUESTION IS IS THAT TO

04:47:35.705 --> 04:47:36.973
WHAT LEVEL SCREENING.

04:47:37.039 --> 04:47:39.141
RIGHT SO EVERYONE OF ACCESS TO A

04:47:39.208 --> 04:47:41.143
PEDIATRICIAN VISIT HAS BEEN

04:47:41.210 --> 04:47:43.412
DEVELOPMENTALLY SCREENED

04:47:43.479 --> 04:47:44.981
QUESTIONS IS IT -- THE

04:47:45.047 --> 04:47:46.248
EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY AND WHAT

04:47:46.315 --> 04:47:47.783
YOU COULD WALK AROUND WHICH IS A

04:47:47.850 --> 04:47:49.752
LEVEL DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING

04:47:49.819 --> 04:47:50.853
FOR YOUR AGE AND ALL.

04:47:50.920 --> 04:47:52.488
HE DEVELOPED THE EYE FOR THAT

04:47:52.555 --> 04:47:53.723
BUT IT'S BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

04:47:53.789 --> 04:47:54.790
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE

04:47:54.857 --> 04:47:57.059
TALKING ABOUT US MORE FORMALIZED

04:47:57.126 --> 04:47:58.027
VALIDATED.

04:47:58.094 --> 04:48:00.262
RIGHT SO AT THAT LEVEL SCREENING

04:48:00.329 --> 04:48:01.597
WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT THEN SEARCH

04:48:01.664 --> 04:48:03.499
RANKING RIGHT SO AND I THINK

04:48:03.566 --> 04:48:06.402
THAT'S THE EXPECTATION I PRESUME --

04:48:06.469 --> 04:48:07.370
FOR TO RECEIVE A PAYMENT I THINK

04:48:07.436 --> 04:48:08.604
THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT AND WE'RE

04:48:08.671 --> 04:48:10.773
STILL FINALIZING POLICY ON HOW

04:48:10.840 --> 04:48:12.541
WE WOULD TRACK BOTH THAT BEING

04:48:12.608 --> 04:48:13.676
TRUE ON BOTH THE DEVELOPMENTAL

AND HEALTHY -- THERE'S A

04:59:34.623 --> 04:59:35.891
QUESTION OF HOW PLANNED

OF THIS IN MIND WE SPENT SEVERAL

04:59:55.711 --> 04:59:57.346
MONTHS RESEARCHING WITH OUR

UPON EACH OTHER SO WE CAN ALL

05:00:17.632 --> 05:00:19.468
GET THE MOST OUT OF IT --

05:00:19.534 --> 05:00:20.836
BECAUSE WE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

MODEL OF CARE -- SHOWING GREAT

05:07:13.548 --> 05:07:15.850
PROMISE IN OUR COMMUNITY OF

FRIEL SENIORS AN AT RISK ADULTS.

05:07:18.653 --> 05:07:20.088
OF THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE FOR YOU

05:07:20.155 --> 05:07:22.257

05:07:22.323 --> 05:07:23.625
THE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY FOR PACE

05:07:23.691 --> 05:07:25.794
PACE IS A COMPREHENSIVE CARE

05:07:25.860 --> 05:07:27.562
PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW -- PEACE

05:07:27.629 --> 05:07:29.030
PROGRAMS ARE CAPITATED THEY'RE

05:07:29.097 --> 05:07:31.065

ACUTE CARE AND LONG TERM CARE

05:07:32.567 --> 05:07:33.701
SERVICES THAT THEY'RE

05:07:33.768 --> 05:07:35.069
BENEFICIARIES NEED.

05:07:35.136 --> 05:07:36.371
AND THAT PAYMENT DOESN'T CHANGE

05:07:36.437 --> 05:07:37.539
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

05:07:37.605 --> 05:07:39.474
THAT PAYMENT TO BE -- SUPPORTIVE

05:07:39.541 --> 05:07:43.111
OF ALL THE THINGS THAT PACE DOES --

05:07:43.178 --> 05:07:45.046

OTHER SERVICES AND FEE FOR

05:07:48.650 --> 05:07:50.318
SERVICE OR MEDICARE ALSO PACES

05:07:50.385 --> 05:07:52.387
ESSENTIALLY THEIR SOLE PROVIDER --

05:07:52.453 --> 05:07:54.189
IS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THAT PACE

05:07:54.255 --> 05:07:56.324
MODERNIZATION ACT OF TWO

05:07:56.391 --> 05:07:56.891
THOUSAND SIXTEEN CHANGE THE

05:07:56.958 --> 05:07:59.294
METHODOLOGY. TO A MORE OF A

05:07:59.360 --> 05:08:00.895
EXPERIENCE BASTER COST BASED

05:08:00.962 --> 05:08:02.897
METHODOLOGY -- SHOULD SIMILAR TO

05:08:02.964 --> 05:08:04.265
THE WAY THAT OUR DEPARTMENT IS

05:08:04.332 --> 05:08:05.733
PAYING MANAGED CARE PLANS.

05:08:05.800 --> 05:08:07.502
WE SUPPORTED THAT MOVE -- IN

05:08:07.569 --> 05:08:08.970
CONCEPT AND IT CERTAINLY CAN

05:08:09.037 --> 05:08:11.272
WORK FOR PACE BUT WE ARE FINDING

05:08:11.339 --> 05:08:13.274
SOME PROBLEMS WITH -- GETTING

05:08:13.341 --> 05:08:14.843
ALL THE COSTS RECOGNIZED -- THAT

05:08:14.909 --> 05:08:16.945
METHODOLOGY SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE

05:08:17.011 --> 05:08:19.080
SUPPORTING THESE CHANGES --

05:08:19.147 --> 05:08:20.515
EXAMPLES OF AREAS WERE HAVING

05:08:20.582 --> 05:08:21.716
PROBLEMS ARE IN THE AREA OF

05:08:21.783 --> 05:08:23.852
CAPITAL COSTS SO PEACE IS A

05:08:23.918 --> 05:08:25.920
CAPITAL INTENSIVE MODEL -- IT

05:08:25.987 --> 05:08:27.655
REQUIRES ME UP TO TEN MILLION

05:08:27.722 --> 05:08:29.357
DOLLARS OR MORE TESTS TO START A

05:08:29.424 --> 05:08:31.192
PEACE CENTER -- IN TODAY'S

05:08:31.259 --> 05:08:33.294
ENVIRONMENT -- THERE'S REALLY

05:08:33.361 --> 05:08:35.496
NOTHING IN THE METHODOLOGY NO

05:08:35.563 --> 05:08:36.898
WAY TO RECOGNIZE THOSE COSTS AND

05:08:36.965 --> 05:08:38.299
ALLOW THEM TO BE RECOUPED IN A

05:08:38.366 --> 05:08:40.635
TIMELY WAY -- AND THE PROGRAMS --

05:08:40.702 --> 05:08:42.370
YOU DO HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT

05:08:42.437 --> 05:08:51.646
INVESTMENTS -- THE PROGRAM IS

05:08:51.713 --> 05:08:53.314
ALSO -- ON TO A HIGHER DEGREE OF

05:08:53.381 --> 05:08:53.982
RISK AND VOLATILITY BECAUSE IT'S

05:08:54.048 --> 05:08:54.549
COVERING EXCLUSIVELY NURSING

05:08:54.616 --> 05:08:55.316
HOME ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES

05:08:55.383 --> 05:08:56.284
THERE'S REALLY NO RISK SHARING

05:08:56.351 --> 05:08:57.151
OUR OUR SPRING I SHOULD SAY --

05:08:57.218 --> 05:08:57.919
AMONG THE BENEFICIARIES LIKE YOU

05:08:57.986 --> 05:08:58.519
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TRADITIONAL

05:08:58.586 --> 05:08:59.520
MANAGED CARE PLANS SO THERE'S A

05:08:59.587 --> 05:09:01.155
A NEED FOR A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

05:09:01.222 --> 05:09:02.557
MARGIN TO HANDLE THE THE

05:09:02.624 --> 05:09:04.259
VOLATILITY AND THAT'S THAT'S

05:09:04.325 --> 05:09:06.794
ALSO NOT ACCOUNTED.

05:09:06.861 --> 05:09:08.496
FOR IN THE METHODOLOGY AND THEN

05:09:08.563 --> 05:09:09.564
FINALLY THE START UP PROGRAMS

05:09:09.631 --> 05:09:11.799
WHICH WERE SEEING MANY TAKE TAKE

05:09:11.866 --> 05:09:13.067
ON STARTING UP THE PROGRAM WHICH

05:09:13.134 --> 05:09:14.068
IS GREAT.

05:09:14.135 --> 05:09:16.271
BUT THE METHODOLOGY DOESN'T

05:09:16.337 --> 05:09:17.505
REALLY TAKE INTOACCOUNT THAT

05:09:17.572 --> 05:09:18.907
THEIR COST STRUCTURE IS HIGHER

05:09:18.973 --> 05:09:20.575
WHEN THEY START BECAUSE THEY

05:09:20.642 --> 05:09:22.543
HAVE HIGHER OVER -- OVER HIM OUT

05:09:22.610 --> 05:09:23.778
THERE SPREADING FIXED COSTS OVER

05:09:23.845 --> 05:09:24.846
A VERY SMALL.

05:09:24.913 --> 05:09:26.748
DAYS SO ANYWAY THE PROPOSAL

05:09:26.814 --> 05:09:28.116
WOULD MAKE SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS

05:09:28.182 --> 05:09:29.817
IN THE METHODOLOGY WE THINK THE

05:09:29.884 --> 05:09:32.153
REASONABLE -- WE HAVE HAD SOME

05:09:32.220 --> 05:09:33.721
PROMISING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

05:09:33.788 --> 05:09:35.390
DEPARTMENT I THINK WE MAY BE ON

05:09:35.456 --> 05:09:36.758
THE SAME PAGE ON SOME OF THE

05:09:36.824 --> 05:09:38.326
PROVISIONS IN THE AND THE

05:09:38.393 --> 05:09:41.629

THAT EVEN WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS

05:09:44.565 --> 05:09:46.000
TO THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDING IF

05:09:46.067 --> 05:09:47.535
WE DO THIS SORT OF FLOOR FOR THE

05:09:47.602 --> 05:09:49.404
PAYMENTS -- THE PAYMENT STILL

05:09:49.470 --> 05:09:50.838
HAVE TO PEOPLE -- WITH THE STATE

05:09:50.905 --> 05:09:53.141
WOULD PAY FOR CARING FOR THESE

05:09:53.207 --> 05:09:54.575
TYPES OF BENEFICIARIES OUTSIDE

05:09:54.642 --> 05:09:56.010
OF PAYS SO IT'S STILL WALK A

05:09:56.077 --> 05:09:59.213

WITH RESPECT TO THE BENCH MARKS --

05:17:59.593 --> 05:18:01.262
ONE WE ARE MOVING OUR MINIMUM

05:18:01.328 --> 05:18:02.596
PERFORMANCE LEVEL FROM THE

05:18:02.663 --> 05:18:03.898
TWENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE TO THE

05:18:03.964 --> 05:18:07.601
FIFTIETH PERCENTILE -- SO THAT

05:18:07.668 --> 05:18:09.003
AGAIN THROUGH THE HIGHER BAR OF

05:18:09.069 --> 05:18:14.575
ACHIEVEMENTS FOR PLANS AND THEN --

05:18:14.642 --> 05:18:15.609
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I

05:18:15.676 --> 05:18:17.978
COULD GEEK OUT ON SO I'M NOT I

05:18:18.045 --> 05:18:19.747
WON'T BUT I'LL JUST -- YOU KNOW

05:18:19.814 --> 05:18:21.382
I THINK QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

05:18:21.449 --> 05:18:22.450
MEASUREMENT.

05:18:22.516 --> 05:18:24.385
IN THE WAY THAT HE DOES DOES IT

05:18:24.452 --> 05:18:26.620
WITH THE PERCENTILES IS ALWAYS

05:18:26.687 --> 05:18:27.922
POTENTIALLY QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE

05:18:27.988 --> 05:18:29.256
YOU COULD BE TERRIBLE BUT STILL

05:18:29.323 --> 05:18:31.459
BE THE BEST OR YOU COULD BE

05:18:31.525 --> 05:18:33.427
REALLY GOOD BUT BE THE WORST --

05:18:33.494 --> 05:18:33.961
AND I THINK THERE'S SOME

05:18:34.028 --> 05:18:35.529
PARTICULAR MEASURES IF YOU IF

05:18:35.596 --> 05:18:36.764
YOU LOOK AT THEM PARTICULARLY

05:18:36.831 --> 05:18:38.065
WITH SUCH AS YOU SCREENING AND

05:18:38.132 --> 05:18:39.600
OTHER THINGS FOR ADOLESCENTS

05:18:39.667 --> 05:18:41.135
WERE LIKE THE NATIONAL.

05:18:41.202 --> 05:18:44.672
THAT LIKE THE TOP IS 25% OF KIDS

05:18:44.738 --> 05:18:45.673

CHANGE HOW WERE HOLDING PLANS

05:18:49.276 --> 05:18:50.211
ACCOUNTABLE SO THERE ARE TWO I

05:18:50.277 --> 05:18:51.545
BELIEVE IT'S TWENTY THREE OF THE

05:18:51.612 --> 05:18:52.346
MEASURES.

05:18:52.413 --> 05:18:54.915
DO YOU HAVE NATIONAL BENCHMARKS

05:18:54.982 --> 05:18:56.984
JUST LIKE STREET BENCHMARKS -- I

05:18:57.051 --> 05:18:58.052
ALWAYS USE THIS WHEN I TOTALLY

05:18:58.118 --> 05:18:58.919
MAKE IT UP BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

05:18:58.986 --> 05:19:00.321
THAT THIS IS ONE BUT LIKE YOU

05:19:00.387 --> 05:19:02.056

KIDS GETTING ALL THEIR

05:19:04.391 --> 05:19:05.559
IMMUNIZATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT

05:19:05.626 --> 05:19:06.694
THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE BUT I USE.

05:19:06.760 --> 05:19:08.062
IT AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S

05:19:08.128 --> 05:19:09.630
THE ONLY ONE I CAN THINK OF SO

05:19:09.697 --> 05:19:10.865
WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE SETTING

05:19:10.931 --> 05:19:12.299
THOSE STANDARDS AND HOLDING

05:19:12.366 --> 05:19:13.901
PLANS NOT JUST TO THE FIFTIETH

05:19:13.968 --> 05:19:15.636
PERCENTILE MPO BUT FOR THOSE

05:19:15.703 --> 05:19:17.238
MEASURES FOR WHICH STANDARDS

05:19:17.304 --> 05:19:18.072
EXIST.

05:19:18.138 --> 05:19:19.373
THAT ARE YOU KNOW PROVEN TO BE

05:19:19.440 --> 05:19:21.308
APPROPRIATE WE WILL BE HOLDING

05:19:21.375 --> 05:19:23.711
PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE AS

05:19:23.777 --> 05:19:25.613
WELL -- AND AGAIN I IT MY TEAM

05:19:25.679 --> 05:19:26.413
KNOWS BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS

05:19:26.480 --> 05:19:27.348
I'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT HOW

05:19:27.414 --> 05:19:28.516
QUALITY MEASUREMENT HAS ALWAYS

05:19:28.582 --> 05:19:30.551
DRIVEN ME CRAZY FROM A

05:19:30.618 --> 05:19:32.386
MATHEMATICAL PERSPECTIVE.

05:19:32.453 --> 05:19:33.554
JUST THAT THAT YOU'RE BETTER

05:19:33.621 --> 05:19:34.355
THAN EVERYONE ELSE DOESN'T MEAN

05:19:34.421 --> 05:19:36.123
YOU'RE GOOD -- MISS SO I'M

05:19:36.190 --> 05:19:37.658
EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND HOPEFULLY

05:19:37.725 --> 05:19:38.726
YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

05:19:38.792 --> 05:19:40.294
TO LOOK AT OUR ARE THERE OTHER

05:19:40.361 --> 05:19:42.029
WAYS THAT A STANDARDIZED

05:19:42.096 --> 05:19:43.664
BENCHMARKS CAN BE ADDED FOR THE

05:19:43.731 --> 05:19:45.432
REST OF THE MEASURES -- BUT JUST

05:19:45.499 --> 05:19:49.303
STARTING WITH THE ONES FOR WHICH-THEY EXIST TODAY -- EDITION ONLY --

05:19:49.370 --> 05:19:51.171
HISTORICALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS

05:19:51.238 --> 05:19:52.773
WHEN A PLAN HAS NOT BEEN MEETING

05:19:52.840 --> 05:19:54.408
ITS PERFORMANCE LEVELS HAS THE

05:19:54.475 --> 05:19:55.643
FIRST STEP IS ALWAYS BEEN A

05:19:55.709 --> 05:19:57.211
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN.

05:19:57.278 --> 05:19:58.979
WHERE WE WORK WITH THE PLAN --

05:19:59.046 --> 05:20:00.981
AND DO A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

05:20:01.048 --> 05:20:02.416
AND PROVIDE MILESTONES THAT THEY

05:20:02.483 --> 05:20:04.652
HAVE TO MEET AND THEN ONLY IF

05:20:04.718 --> 05:20:05.619
THEY DON'T.

05:20:05.686 --> 05:20:06.887
COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE

05:20:06.954 --> 05:20:08.656
MILESTONES DID WE SANCTION THE

05:20:08.722 --> 05:20:11.325
HEALTH PLANS -- ON ON THE ON

05:20:11.392 --> 05:20:12.826
THESE QUALITY MEASURES -- WE

05:20:12.893 --> 05:20:14.562
HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT

05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:16.664
APPROACH AND NOW WITH WITH THESE

05:20:16.730 --> 05:20:19.033
HIGHER -- STANDARDS THAT IF A

05:20:19.099 --> 05:20:21.168
PLAN IS IS FAILING TO MEET THOSE

05:20:21.235 --> 05:20:22.536
STANDARDS WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY

05:20:22.603 --> 05:20:24.305
ISSUE A SANCTION AND TO DO THE

05:20:24.371 --> 05:20:26.240
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN.

05:20:26.307 --> 05:20:26.774
THAT COULD LEAD TO FUTURE

05:20:26.840 --> 05:20:29.877
SECTIONS -- AGAIN WE WE HAVE

05:20:29.944 --> 05:20:32.212
FOUND AND I THINK WE HAVE SEEN --

05:20:32.279 --> 05:20:33.747
AS WE HAVE SORT OF IN MORE

05:20:33.814 --> 05:20:35.049
RECENT YEARS BEEN USING THE

05:20:35.115 --> 05:20:37.585
SANCTION TOOL THAT IT HAS DRIVEN

05:20:37.651 --> 05:20:38.953
CHANGE IN A FASTER WAY THAN

05:20:39.019 --> 05:20:40.321
WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHEN WE

05:20:40.387 --> 05:20:42.022
WEREN'T DOING IT -- SO WE THINK

05:20:42.089 --> 05:20:43.857
IT IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT

05:20:43.924 --> 05:20:46.794
WE SHOULD BE USING -- MORE

05:20:46.860 --> 05:20:48.295
APPROPRIATELY AND MORE OFTEN --

05:20:48.362 --> 05:20:49.229
THE OTHER THINGS WHERE YOU

05:20:49.296 --> 05:20:50.698

05:20:50.764 --> 05:20:52.366
CAPS SURVEY FROM EVERY THREE

05:20:52.433 --> 05:20:53.968
YEARS TO EVERY TWO YEARS AND

05:20:54.034 --> 05:20:56.070
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DOING SO

05:20:56.136 --> 05:20:57.738

05:21:03.811 --> 05:21:05.646
THESE INCREASED A WITH THE

05:21:05.713 --> 05:21:06.580
INCREASED NUMBER OF MEASURES

05:21:06.647 --> 05:21:08.449
SORT OF A A MORE ROBUST ANNUAL

05:21:08.515 --> 05:21:09.717
COMPLIANCE REPORTS THAT WE WOULD

IS SOMETHING THAT.

05:22:11.311 --> 05:22:13.013
THEY SHOULD ALREADY KNOW IT

RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING NEW

05:22:15.015 --> 05:22:16.316
ABOUT GETTING KIDS IN FOR

05:22:16.383 --> 05:22:17.584
REGULAR CHECK UPS THAT'S BEEN

05:22:17.651 --> 05:22:20.454
AROUND FOR DECADES.

05:22:20.521 --> 05:22:22.256
SO SOMEONE WHO SAYS I'M A HEALTH

05:22:22.322 --> 05:22:24.758
PLAN.

05:22:24.825 --> 05:22:27.294
CHOUDARY KNOW HOW TO DO THIS NOW

05:22:27.361 --> 05:22:29.029
HE IS SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

05:22:29.096 --> 05:22:31.031
HARD TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHEN I

05:22:31.098 --> 05:22:33.434
GET HOT NOW I GET A CHANCE TO

05:22:33.500 --> 05:22:34.968
FIX THIS THING LIKE THAT WAS

05:22:35.035 --> 05:22:35.869
SUPPOSED TO A PAGE IN THE FIRST

05:22:35.936 --> 05:22:38.439
PLACE USED WHEN YOU APPLIED TO

05:22:38.505 --> 05:22:38.605

THIS.

05:22:39.740 --> 05:22:40.808
I MEAN THIS IS SO CORE I MEAN

05:22:40.874 --> 05:22:41.842
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THESE -- IT'S

05:22:41.909 --> 05:22:42.876
A NEW MEASURE WE'RE STILL

05:22:42.943 --> 05:22:44.378
FIGURING IT OUT KIND OF THING I

05:22:44.445 --> 05:22:45.713
MEAN THIS IS A STANDARD THAT'S

05:22:45.779 --> 05:22:49.450
BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

05:22:49.516 --> 05:22:52.186
AND IF A IF YOU DO AND AND SO --

05:22:52.252 --> 05:22:53.520
SO WELL CERTAINLY PEOPLE CAN

05:22:53.587 --> 05:22:54.822
ALWAYS LEARN THINGS AND ACTUALLY

05:22:54.888 --> 05:22:56.390
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE GET

05:22:56.457 --> 05:22:57.991
PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THE

05:22:58.058 --> 05:22:58.792
DIFFERENT PLANS A SHARE BACK

05:22:58.859 --> 05:23:00.327

I MEAN.

05:23:03.497 --> 05:23:04.431
I MEAN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

05:23:04.498 --> 05:23:07.101
PLANS THAT ARE BELOW 20% OF KIDS

05:23:07.167 --> 05:23:09.203
GETTING SCREENED.

05:23:09.269 --> 05:23:11.939
THAT -- AND AND YOU THINK ABOUT.

05:23:12.005 --> 05:23:13.540
BY THE WAY THE PROBLEM IS NOT

05:23:13.607 --> 05:23:14.975
LIKE SOMEONE GOES BACK AND

05:23:15.042 --> 05:23:16.577
CATCHES UP ON EVERYTHING AT W.

05:23:16.643 --> 05:23:18.078
MISSED THAT WINDOW OF TIME YOU

05:23:19.413 --> 05:23:21.582
THE SCREENING OF STAY OR HAVE A

05:23:21.648 --> 05:23:23.884
LEARNING DISABILITY OR SOMETHING.

05:23:23.951 --> 05:23:25.452

TO FIND THIS OUT NOW I MEAN THIS --

05:23:43.237 --> 05:23:46.106
BUT I THINK THAT -- I APPRECIATE

05:23:46.173 --> 05:23:47.908
THAT THE SITE HE YOU SHOULD

05:23:52.813 --> 05:23:53.447
MEASURES THAT WE SHOULD BE

05:23:53.514 --> 05:23:55.115
BASING MORE ON ABSOLUTE MEASURES

05:23:55.182 --> 05:24:00.788
AND NOT JUST RELATIVES YOU SAID.

05:24:00.854 --> 05:24:02.089

WITH YOU ON THAT RIGHT NOW YOU

05:24:02.756 --> 05:24:03.290
KNOW I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

05:24:03.357 --> 05:24:04.358
FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE

05:24:04.424 --> 05:24:06.059
GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO

05:24:06.126 --> 05:24:07.961
RIGHT -- AND DOES COME UP WITH

05:24:08.028 --> 05:24:10.464
BEST PRACTICES AND SO FORTH BUT

05:24:10.531 --> 05:24:13.066
AT A CERTAIN POINT ALSO IS THAT

05:24:13.133 --> 05:24:14.268
YOU SIGNED UP TO DO THIS YOU

05:24:14.334 --> 05:24:15.536
SHOULD ARRAY OF KNOWING HOW TO

05:24:15.602 --> 05:24:17.571
DO THIS -- NOW YOU COULD COULD

05:24:17.638 --> 05:24:19.173
YOU DO BETTER YEAH WE YOU AND

05:24:19.239 --> 05:24:20.707
MAYBE LEARN HOW TO DO BETTER BUT

05:24:20.774 --> 05:24:24.511
YOU SHOULD BE STARTING OFF LIKE --

05:24:24.578 --> 05:24:25.112
I DIDN'T DO VERY WELL TO START

05:24:25.179 --> 05:24:25.312
WITH.

05:24:25.379 --> 05:24:27.414
I MEAN THAT'S JUST.

05:24:27.481 --> 05:24:28.015
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

05:24:28.081 --> 05:24:28.615
DOING A CONTRACT THEN AT THAT

05:24:28.682 --> 05:24:30.751
POINT SO.

05:24:30.818 --> 05:24:33.754

BECAUSE THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT

05:24:37.558 --> 05:24:39.092
CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT ONLY THE

05:24:39.159 --> 05:24:40.561
CHILDREN THOSE CHILDREN BECOME

05:24:40.627 --> 05:24:43.130
THE ADULTS AND THE STATE OF

05:24:43.197 --> 05:24:44.965
CALIFORNIA AND JOAN OF PEOPLE

05:24:45.032 --> 05:24:46.099
KNOW THE HISTORY OF U. P. S. D.

05:24:46.166 --> 05:24:48.068
T..

05:24:48.135 --> 05:24:48.969
THE FEDERAL PROGRAM.

05:24:49.036 --> 05:24:50.504
DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF IT NOW

05:24:50.571 --> 05:24:54.174
OKAY I REALIZE IT'S LATE BUY ME

05:24:54.241 --> 05:24:54.775
A VERY.

05:24:54.842 --> 05:24:57.144
AND IT'S I WENT OFF ON MY IN MY

05:24:57.211 --> 05:24:57.811
QUALITY MEASUREMENT THING SO YOU

05:24:57.878 --> 05:24:58.612
KNOW.

05:24:58.679 --> 05:25:00.447
SO BY THE WAY SO HE PST TEA IN

05:25:00.514 --> 05:25:02.883
THE MED AND THE MEDICAID PROGRAM

05:25:02.950 --> 05:25:04.284
OBVIOUSLY F. AS IN EVERY STATE.

05:25:04.351 --> 05:25:08.121
WAS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED AROUND

05:25:08.188 --> 05:25:09.089
THE TIME OF THE VIETNAM WAR.

05:25:09.156 --> 05:25:09.890
AND THE REASON IT WAS

05:25:09.957 --> 05:25:12.426
ESTABLISHED IS BECAUSE WE HAD A

05:25:12.492 --> 05:25:13.627
DRAFT FOR THE WAR.

LICENSING FEES OF C. H. A. HAS

LICENSING FEES ARE INCREASING --

05:46:52.091 --> 05:46:53.893
THIS IS THE SIXTH YEAR IN A ROW

PROPOSED IT'S WORKING OUT TO BE

05:46:57.563 --> 05:47:00.599

THAT'S A SUSTAINABLE RATE OR NOT

05:47:15.414 --> 05:47:17.016

BIT EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND

05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:33.699
THEREFORE WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS

05:47:33.766 --> 05:47:35.167
YEAR'S P. INCREASE.

05:47:35.234 --> 05:47:35.901

IT'S HAPPENING EVERY YEAR NOW.

05:48:17.943 --> 05:48:19.545

EVEN GREATER FOR HOSPITAL THAT'S

05:48:22.214 --> 05:48:23.549

AND WE WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH

05:50:05.951 --> 05:50:06.785
SOME OF THE COMMENTS AT THE LA --

05:50:06.852 --> 05:50:09.121
MADE -- WE'VE BEEN UNDERGOING A

05:50:09.188 --> 05:50:11.357
KIND OF A LONG REACH

05:50:11.423 --> 05:50:13.559
TRANSFORMATION PROCESS -- AND I

05:50:13.625 --> 05:50:14.693
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

05:50:14.760 --> 05:50:16.562
REMEMBER IT STARTS PRIOR TO EVEN

05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:18.130
WHEN THE SOME OF THOSE INITIAL

05:50:18.197 --> 05:50:20.132
CHANGES STARTED IN BAD BUDGET

05:50:20.199 --> 05:50:22.534
YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HELD OFF

05:50:22.601 --> 05:50:23.802
ON OR OR I THINK EVEN LOWERED

05:50:23.869 --> 05:50:25.404
SOME OF THESE FEES FOR HOSPITALS

05:50:25.471 --> 05:50:26.805
BECAUSE WE WERE CUTTING THEM SO

05:50:26.872 --> 05:50:28.307
SEVERELY ON THE MEDICAL.

05:50:28.374 --> 05:50:30.476
SIDE -- AND THERE WAS JUST THERE

05:50:30.542 --> 05:50:31.977
IS SORT OF THIS UNDERSTANDING

05:50:32.044 --> 05:50:33.379
DURING THE BAD BUDGET YEARS THAT

05:50:33.445 --> 05:50:35.514
WE NEEDED TO NOT GO THERE BUT

05:50:35.581 --> 05:50:37.116
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE INTERVENING

05:50:37.182 --> 05:50:38.217
TIME IS.

SUFFER -- THERE WERE DEATHS THEY

05:50:43.622 --> 05:50:45.457

FOR EVERY HUMANS FOR PATIENTS

05:50:46.859 --> 05:50:48.627

THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL

06:23:59.516 --> 06:24:00.817
LEVEL IS THAT THE FUNDING IS

THAT THE HOUSE WAS TO DISPENSE

06:24:29.946 --> 06:24:31.081
THIS.

06:24:31.148 --> 06:24:32.449
HOW DO YOU SEE IT BEING

06:24:32.516 --> 06:24:34.317

06:24:35.919 --> 06:24:38.121
CHECK AND SEE SELECTOR WITH ME

06:24:38.188 --> 06:24:38.855
TO DOWN THE ROAD THAT UP SO

06:24:38.922 --> 06:24:39.723
WOULD BE AN ALLOCATION THAT

06:24:39.790 --> 06:24:40.924
WOULD BE CREATED BY THE

06:24:40.991 --> 06:24:41.925
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

06:24:41.992 --> 06:24:43.593

06:24:46.930 --> 06:24:47.597
FUNDING SOURCES.

06:24:47.664 --> 06:24:49.166
WE LOOK AT PREVALENCE OF CERTAIN

06:24:49.232 --> 06:24:51.601
FACTORS IN THE COMMUNITIES AND

06:24:51.668 --> 06:24:52.202
THEN BUILD A FUNDING STRUCTURE

06:24:52.269 --> 06:24:53.103
BASED ON THAT.

06:24:53.170 --> 06:24:53.937
ALL RIGHT I'M I'M GOING TO

06:24:54.004 --> 06:25:00.076

NEED I KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE

06:25:10.220 --> 06:25:13.290
HEADLINES NOW -- I THINK WHEN I

06:25:13.356 --> 06:25:14.991
THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE HAVING TO

06:25:15.058 --> 06:25:16.326
DO WITH WILD FIRES RIGHT AND WE

06:25:16.393 --> 06:25:17.727
HAVE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM.

06:25:17.794 --> 06:25:19.196

TRUCKS FOR LOCAL HOLLERED FIRE

06:25:21.331 --> 06:25:22.532
DEPARTMENTS WHO JUST THEN CAN

06:25:22.599 --> 06:25:24.568
USE THEM FOR THAT MEET THE NEEDS

06:25:24.634 --> 06:25:28.205
OF WILD FIRES AND OTHER TYPES OF

06:25:28.271 --> 06:25:30.340
THINGS -- THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD

06:25:30.407 --> 06:25:32.309
THINK ABOUT MUTUAL AID W. AT

THERE'S A MUTUAL AID STRUCTURE

06:25:33.376 --> 06:25:34.411
BUT THINK ABOUT FINDING -- A

06:25:34.478 --> 06:25:36.012
SYSTEM WHERE PRHAPS WHAT

06:25:36.079 --> 06:25:37.581
HAPPENS IS THE PART OF A PUBLIC

06:25:37.647 --> 06:25:39.783
HEALTH THE THE STATE FARM FILED

OUT FOR TO TAKE CARE OF ME IT

06:25:48.191 --> 06:25:49.326

TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE

06:27:22.786 --> 06:27:23.353
THING THAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS

06:27:23.420 --> 06:27:23.987
THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO

THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT.

06:52:54.850 --> 06:52:56.151
AND THE REASON FOR THE DECREASE

06:52:56.218 --> 06:52:57.819
PRIMARILY AS A DECREASE IN

06:52:57.886 --> 06:52:59.554
MEDICATION EXPENDITURES. FOR

06:52:59.621 --> 06:53:01.323
MEDICATION ONLY CLIENTS WHO ARE

HAVE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH

06:53:04.092 --> 06:53:07.996
COVERAGE AND FOR WHOM WE PAY THE

06:53:08.063 --> 06:53:09.798
ENTIRE COST MEDICATION -- FOR

06:53:09.865 --> 06:53:12.334
BUDGET YEAR FISCAL YEAR TWO

06:53:12.400 --> 06:53:12.868
THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY A

06:53:12.934 --> 06:53:13.702
PROPOSED EIGHT AT LOCAL SYSTEMS

06:53:13.768 --> 06:53:15.770
FINDING IS FOUR HUNDRED FORTY

06:53:15.837 --> 06:53:16.905
NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION WHICH

06:53:16.972 --> 06:53:19.274
IS AN INCREASE OF FIFTEEN POINT

06:53:19.341 --> 06:53:20.709
SEVEN MILLION OR THREE POINT 6%

06:53:20.775 --> 06:53:22.744
WHEN COMPARED TO THE TWO

06:53:22.811 --> 06:53:23.578
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET OUT AN

06:53:23.645 --> 06:53:25.380
INCREASE OF FORTY ONE POINT.

06:53:25.447 --> 06:53:27.249
NINE MILLION WHEN COMPARED TO

06:53:27.315 --> 06:53:28.884
THE REVISED COUNT YOUR BUDGET.

06:53:28.950 --> 06:53:30.385
AND INCREASE HERE IS PRIMARILY

06:53:30.452 --> 06:53:31.820
DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OVERALL

06:53:31.887 --> 06:53:34.156
MEDICATION EXPENDITURES AS WELL

06:53:34.222 --> 06:53:37.792
AS THE INCREASE AND INSURANCE

06:53:37.859 --> 06:53:39.227
PREMIUM EXPENDITURES.

06:53:39.294 --> 06:53:39.928
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO FOR THE

06:53:39.995 --> 06:53:41.630
SAKE OF TIME I JUST WANT TO DRAW

06:53:41.696 --> 06:53:43.064
ATTENTION TO ONE ITEM BECAUSE I

06:53:43.131 --> 06:53:45.600
BELIEVE -- THERE WAS A REQUEST

06:53:45.667 --> 06:53:49.905

06:53:56.111 --> 06:53:57.979
CHANGE IN BUDGET AUTHORITY --

06:53:58.046 --> 06:53:59.247

THEIR RATES OF STV'S IN

06:55:12.988 --> 06:55:15.423
CALIFORNIA CONTINUED TO INCREASE.

06:55:15.490 --> 06:55:17.892
OUR PROVISIONAL DATA FOR TWO

06:55:17.959 --> 06:55:18.860
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SHOWS ABOUT

06:55:18.927 --> 06:55:20.328
THE RATE OF INCREASE OF ALL

06:55:20.395 --> 06:55:22.897
MAJOR STV'S HE'S.

06:55:22.964 --> 06:55:24.366
STILL ON THE RISE.

06:55:24.432 --> 06:55:25.667
OUR LAST YEAR THROUGH A

06:55:25.734 --> 06:55:28.103
STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL ON WE

06:55:28.169 --> 06:55:29.771
RECEIVED AN AUGMENTATION OF TWO

06:55:29.838 --> 06:55:31.306
MILLION DOLLARS.

06:55:31.373 --> 06:55:35.410
THAT WAS -- UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A

06:55:35.477 --> 06:55:37.345
ONE TIME A ROMAN TATIAN -- OLDER

06:55:37.412 --> 06:55:39.281
THERE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO A

06:55:39.347 --> 06:55:40.615
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN

06:55:40.682 --> 06:55:42.450
INCREASING THEIR CAPACITY AND I

06:55:42.517 --> 06:55:42.784
CAN.

06:55:42.851 --> 06:55:44.319
I WILL COME BACK IN A MINUTE

06:55:44.386 --> 06:55:44.953
TELL YOU MORE WHEN THEY'VE DONE

06:55:45.020 --> 06:55:46.187
WITHOUT.

06:55:46.254 --> 06:55:48.223
THE CHALLENGE FOR THEM HAS BEEN

06:55:48.290 --> 06:55:49.457
THAT BEING THAT IS A ONE TIME

06:55:49.524 --> 06:55:50.692
AUGMENTATION THEY HAVE BEEN

06:55:50.759 --> 06:55:53.395
UNABLE TO SECURE PERSONAL

06:55:53.461 --> 06:55:54.696
RESOURCES TO DO THAT MUCH NEEDED

06:55:54.763 --> 06:55:56.231
WORK THEY NEED TO DO.

06:55:56.298 --> 06:55:57.732
SO A LOT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING

06:55:57.799 --> 06:55:59.367
IS -- ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT

06:55:59.434 --> 06:56:02.304
REQUIRE STAFF RESOURCES SO OUR

06:56:02.370 --> 06:56:04.939
PROPOSAL IS -- IN THE HOPES THAT

06:56:05.006 --> 06:56:05.540
WE CAN MAKE THAT TWO MILLION

06:56:05.607 --> 06:56:07.776
DOLLAR -- AUGMENTATION PERMANENT

06:56:07.842 --> 06:56:09.678
SO THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

06:56:09.744 --> 06:56:10.812
DON'T HAVE TWO YET AND DO

06:56:10.879 --> 06:56:14.449
ANOTHER REDUCTION IN THIS TO THE

06:56:14.516 --> 06:56:15.850

06:56:27.095 --> 06:56:30.265
MILLION REQUESTS -- SO I KNOW

06:56:30.999 --> 06:56:32.667
DIFFERENT ANSWER BUT THIS TWO

06:56:32.734 --> 06:56:34.469
MILLION REALLY ENOUGH.

06:56:34.536 --> 06:56:35.737
NO BUT I THINK.

06:56:35.804 --> 06:56:36.638
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT TWO

06:56:36.705 --> 06:56:38.673
MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT ENOUGH I

06:56:38.740 --> 06:56:40.475
MEAN I THINK WE HAVE AN

06:56:40.542 --> 06:56:42.243
INCREASING PROBLEM ABOUT HI

06:56:42.310 --> 06:56:43.378
SONYA GETTING WORSE.

06:56:43.445 --> 06:56:44.946
SO ARE CLEARLY TWO MILLION

06:56:45.013 --> 06:56:48.116
DOLLARS IS IS JUST -- TO KEEP US

06:56:48.183 --> 06:56:48.683
WHERE WE ARE TODAY IT'S NOT

06:56:48.750 --> 06:56:50.485
GOING TO HELP -- IN IMPROVING

06:56:50.552 --> 06:56:53.054
THE SITUATION MORE THAN THAT --

06:56:53.121 --> 06:56:55.023
I THINK THERE ARE.

06:56:55.090 --> 06:56:56.358
A BUDGET ESTIMATES THAT.

06:56:56.424 --> 06:56:58.626
AND PROJECTIONS THAT CAN BE MADE

06:56:58.693 --> 06:56:59.928
USING CDC.

06:56:59.994 --> 06:57:01.529
ARE GORY FILMS THAT WILL TELL

06:57:01.596 --> 06:57:02.964
YOU THAT TO ACTUALLY TURN THE

06:57:03.031 --> 06:57:06.034
CURB ON STDS WE NEED A MUCH

06:57:06.101 --> 06:57:07.535
LARGER INVESTMENT OKAY.

06:57:07.602 --> 06:57:08.470
OR MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME

06:57:08.536 --> 06:57:10.138
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN LOOKING

06:57:10.205 --> 06:57:11.706
AT THAT AND I MEAN I I THINK THE

06:57:11.773 --> 06:57:14.976
OTHER PART IS THE THINK ABOUT SO

06:57:15.043 --> 06:57:16.378
ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE RATE

06:57:16.444 --> 06:57:17.245
WE'RE TALKING HOW MUCH MONEY WE

06:57:17.312 --> 06:57:17.946
NEED TO PUT IN.

06:57:18.012 --> 06:57:18.646
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE

06:57:18.713 --> 06:57:19.981
SPENDING ON THE MEDICAL SIDE

06:57:20.048 --> 06:57:21.383
WHEN PEOPLE YELL NEED DIRECT

06:57:21.449 --> 06:57:24.119
HEALTH SERVICES FROM THESE STDS.

06:57:24.185 --> 06:57:25.653
AND HOW MUCH WERE SO I KNOW WE

06:57:25.720 --> 06:57:27.789
WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT OUT PROP

06:57:27.856 --> 06:57:29.257
FIFTY SIX AND SOME OF THAT BUT

06:57:29.324 --> 06:57:31.426
ALSO ON THE ON TERMS OF THE ON

06:57:31.493 --> 06:57:34.529
THE MEDIC HAL AND GREAT BECAUSE

06:57:34.596 --> 06:57:36.297
WHEN SOMEONE HAS AN STD.

06:57:36.364 --> 06:57:37.766
THEY'RE ALSO GONNA SIR FOR

06:57:37.832 --> 06:57:40.168
HEALTH CONSEQUENCES THAT THEN.

06:57:40.235 --> 06:57:41.403
IF THEY'RE A MEDIC HOW THAT'S

06:57:41.469 --> 06:57:43.505
GOING TO COST MEDICAL PROGRAM

06:57:43.571 --> 06:57:46.574
RIGHT NOW -- SO -- WE TALK ABOUT

06:57:46.641 --> 06:57:48.843
THOSE BABY THE ONLY TALK ABOUT

06:57:48.910 --> 06:57:49.477
THIRTY BABIES WHO ARE STILL BORN

06:57:49.544 --> 06:57:51.379
BUT AND THAT'S TERRIBLE BUT WE

06:57:51.446 --> 06:57:53.114
ALSO HAVE A LOT OF OTHER BABIES

06:57:53.181 --> 06:57:55.483
WERE BORN YOU NOW HAVE --

06:57:55.550 --> 06:57:58.253
INJURIES STRAIGHT AND AND SOME

06:57:58.319 --> 06:58:00.989
OF THEM HAVE LONG TERM AND SO

06:58:01.055 --> 06:58:02.624
THAT HEALTH COSTS THAT.

06:58:02.690 --> 06:58:04.192
EDUCATION COSTS DEVELOPMENTAL

06:58:04.259 --> 06:58:05.226
COSTS.

06:58:05.293 --> 06:58:06.928
SO I HOPE WE CAN LOOK AT THIS IN

06:58:06.995 --> 06:58:09.664
TERMS OF NOT JUST LIKE OH WELL

06:58:09.731 --> 06:58:11.232
TWO MILLION AND DO WE WANT TO DO

06:58:11.299 --> 06:58:12.867
WATER AND HOW MUCH THAT COSTS

06:58:12.934 --> 06:58:14.402
BUT WHAT'S THE COST OF NOT DOING

06:58:14.469 --> 06:58:15.603
ANYTHING HOW MUCH ARE WE

06:58:15.670 --> 06:58:16.971
SPENDING NOW.

06:58:17.038 --> 06:58:18.740
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH

06:58:18.807 --> 06:58:20.508
AND NOT CHANGING THE CURVE.

06:58:20.575 --> 06:58:21.509
SO I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I

06:58:21.576 --> 06:58:23.311
PREVIOUS OFTEN POSE IT SAID THIS

06:58:23.378 --> 06:58:26.080
ONE'S PRIVATE OVER COMPLICATED

06:58:26.147 --> 06:58:30.752
FIGURE OUT BUT FOR A A BUT YEAH.

06:58:30.819 --> 06:58:31.519
YEAH I CERTAINLY CAN'T ANSWER

06:58:31.586 --> 06:58:32.420
THAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW AND I I

06:58:32.487 --> 06:58:33.555
MEAN I GUESS ONE THING OUR

06:58:33.621 --> 06:58:34.989
OFFICE WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS

06:58:35.056 --> 06:58:37.158
PROPOSAL OR NOT WELL WE WOULDN'T.

06:58:37.225 --> 06:58:38.460
NECESSARILY HAVE A AN

06:58:38.526 --> 06:58:39.961
ALTERNATIVE AMOUNT TO RECOMMEND

06:58:40.028 --> 06:58:41.896
RIGHT NOW THE TWO MILLION

06:58:41.963 --> 06:58:43.264
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE AN ANALYTIC

06:58:43.331 --> 06:58:44.999
PIECE IS ONLY BASED ON THE FACT

06:58:45.066 --> 06:58:46.568
THAT TWO MILLION ONE TIME WAS

06:58:46.634 --> 06:58:47.669
PROVIDED LAST YEAR.

06:58:47.735 --> 06:58:49.170
RIGHT SO THAT WAS ONE OF OUR

06:58:49.237 --> 06:58:50.438
CONCERNS WHEN WE SAW THIS

06:58:50.505 --> 06:58:51.639
PROPOSAL THAT.

06:58:51.706 --> 06:58:53.675
BASICALLY THE TWO MILLION

06:58:53.741 --> 06:58:55.210
REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO

06:58:55.276 --> 06:58:58.046
PRIORITIZE ONE TERRIBLE.

06:58:58.112 --> 06:59:02.484
DISEASE OVER ANOTHER -- SO IT

06:59:02.550 --> 06:59:06.154
YOU KNOW SO I I THAT'S WHY IS IT

06:59:06.221 --> 06:59:07.589
IN THE RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS

06:59:07.655 --> 06:59:08.723
THE CURRENT PROPOSAL BUT USING

06:59:08.790 --> 06:59:10.325
THE ANALYTICS WE SHOULD FIND OUT

06:59:10.391 --> 06:59:11.860
LIKE HOW MUCH YOU REALLY NEED TO

06:59:11.926 --> 06:59:13.394
BEND THE CURVE RIGHT BECAUSE

06:59:13.461 --> 06:59:15.463
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.

06:59:15.530 --> 06:59:16.598
OR WHAT HOW MUCH WE REALLY NEED.

06:59:16.664 --> 06:59:17.699
SO OBVIOUSLY TOO MANY IS BETTER

06:59:17.765 --> 06:59:19.400

THAT NUMBER IS AND THEN WE HAVE

06:59:28.710 --> 06:59:29.978
A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE IT IS

06:59:30.044 --> 06:59:31.279
