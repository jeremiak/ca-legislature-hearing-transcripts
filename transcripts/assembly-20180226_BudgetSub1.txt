THIS WILL BEGIN OUR FIRST SOMEONE HEARING THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW OF THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE AUTHORITY. IF WE COULD HAVE THE FIRST PANEL COME FOR AUTHORITY. WHICH I'LL REFER TO AS THE EMS AUTHORITY THIS IS DANCE MY WAY OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANALYSTS. AND AS REQUESTED A PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR BUDGET IN ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE TO LAST YEAR'S CATASTROPHIC FIRES. OR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH EMS AUTHORITY RESPONSIBLE FOR. COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION OF ALL STATE ACTIVITIES CONCERNING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. THE MS AUTHORITIES A SMALL DEPARTMENT WITH RESPONSIBILITIES IN THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES. FIRST OUR PRE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH IS ONE PIECE OF AN EMERGENCY CARE NETWORK. INTEGRATED WITH HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER SERVICES. NINE ONE ONE MEDICAL SERVICES OR WIDELY SEEN BY THE PUBLIC AS A GUARANTEED RESPONSE FOR ALL IN ONE OF OUR MAJOR HEALTH CARE SAFETY NETS. IN CALIFORNIA THERE NOW MORE THAN SIXTY TWO THOUSAND CERTIFIED EMTS AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND LICENSE PARAMEDICS. THE RESPOND TO NEARLY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION NINE ONE ONE CALLS FOR EMERGENCY SERVICE ANNUALLY. WE'RE USING THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED GROUND AMBULANCES AND ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR AIR AMBULANCES. AND THEY TAKE THE ILL OR INJURED TWO ONE OF THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO CARE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS THAT ALSO. MAY BE A DESIGNATED SPECIALTY CARE CENTER. SPECIFICALLY THAT YOU MUST AUTHORITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING PARAMEDICS AND DISCIPLINING THE LICENSE WHEN NEEDED. SETTINGS GO FOR PRACTICE TRAINING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF UMASS INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST AID. AND THERE'S BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS CONCERNING MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR BOTH THE PUBLIC. AND FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. THAT HAVE PASSED ANSWER WITH IMPLEMENTING TACTICAL MEDICAL CARE TRAINING CURRICULUM. AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS. TRAINING FOR USE OF EPINEPHRINE FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONS AND THE LOCKS ON FOR NARCOTIC OVERDOSE. WE ALSO SET TRAINING STANDARDS CERTIFIED TRAINING FOR LICENSED CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. AND HELP TRAIN THE PUBLIC IN CPR AND STOP THE BLEEDING CAMPAIGNS. ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE TO FROM YOU MUST AUTHORITY REGARDING THE ROLE OF PARAMEDICS IS APPROVED HEALTH WORKFORCE PILOT PROJECT THROUGH THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. TO TEST AND EVALUATE THE USE OF PARAMEDICS AND EXPANDED MOBILE HEALTH CARE ROLLS OF FILM IDENTIFIED GAPS. IN LOCAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO AN INTEGRATION OF CARE. THE EVALUATION FOR THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BY THE UC SAN FRANCISCO CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY AND WORKFORCE. DEMONSTRATE THE PARAMEDICS PARAMEDICS CAN SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORK WITH PATIENTS TO REDUCE REPEAT HOSPITALIZATIONS. TO DECREASE NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY USE. PERFORM OUTREACH FOR HARD TO REACH PATIENTS. AND IDENTIFY PATIENTS A CAN BE BETTER TREATED IN SETTINGS OTHER THAN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ALL WITHOUT SUPPLANTING ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OR INCURRING ANY ADVERSE PATIENT OUTCOMES. SECOND OF THE YOU MUST AUTHORITY DEVELOPS GUIDELINES IN A PREVIOUS PLANS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEMS BETTER IMPLEMENT AND OPERATED BY LOCAL UMASS AGENCIES. THERE ARE THIRTY THREE LOCAL UMASS AGENCIES SEVEN MULTI COUNTY AGENCIES THAT PRIMARILY SERVE RURAL AREAS AND THAT RECEIVE SOME SUPPORT FROM STATE GENERAL FUNDS. AND TWENTY SIX SINGLE COUNTY AGENCIES. DIRECT NINE ONE ONE AMBULANCE SERVICES PROVIDED BY A MIXTURE OF PUBLIC FIRE AGENCIES AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS AND VOLUNTEERS. THE MS AUTHORITY DEVELOPS REGULATIONS FOR DESIGN AND QUALITY OF SPECIALTY CARE SYSTEMS. INCLUDING IN OUR TRAUMA SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY HAS EIGHTY ONE DESIGNATED CENTERS. PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE THAT CURRENTLY HAS A HUNDRED AND ELEVEN CENTERS. STROKES SYSTEM WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR SET DESIGNATED CENTERS A CARDIAC OR STEMI SYSTEM WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DESIGNATED CENTERS. AND THE CALIFORNIA POISON CONTROL SYSTEM THAT HANDLES NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POISON EXPOSURES EACH YEAR. ONE OF OUR PRIORITY INITIATIVES IS TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MC UMASS SYSTEM USING IMPROVE THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL DATA. WITH A SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN TWENTY NINE WHICH WAS CHAPTER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE'RE CONVERTING ALL OUR PROVIDERS TO ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION TO PAY IS PATIENT CARE THE CAN BE. AGGREGATED ANALYZING USE FOR SYSTEM EVALUATION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT. WE HAVE FINISHED WORK ON A NATIONAL GRANT TO EXCHANGE CLINICAL DATA WITH HOSPITALS. SO THE PARAMEDICS KANNAPOLIS XIN INFORMATION IN THE FIELD AND HOSPITALS TO RECEIVE PRE ARRIVAL INFORMATION FROM ME A MASS. THIS INITIAL LIVE WILL ALSO IMPROVE CARE DURING THE DISASTER BY MAKING CRITICAL PATIENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN PATIENTS ARE TREATED IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. S. B. NINETEEN CHAPTER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WILL FURTHER UTILIZE THESE HEALTH INFORMATION ADVANCES TO DESIGN AND TEST A REGISTRY FOR END F LIFE POSITION ORDERS KNOWN AS POST FORMS. THAT THE M. S. AUTHORITY DEVELOPED AND UPDATES. OUR THIRD MAJOR AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY IS THE MEDICAL RESPONSE TO DISASTER. WE PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND FEDERAL LOCAL PARTNERS TO BUILD A PUBLIC HEALTH. AND MEDICAL EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTION. PLAN RESPOND TO THE MEDICAL IMPACT IF ANY TYPE OF DISASTER OR HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND AS PART OF OUR PLANNING EFFORTS INVEST AUTHORITY DEVELOP THE HOSPITAL INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM. WHICH HAS BECOME A NATIONAL STANDARD IN AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL. TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE IN THE FIELD THE EMS AUTHORITIES DEVELOPED A TIERED SYSTEM. THERE FORTY TWO AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS HOUSED IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT CAN TRANSPORT PATIENTS ARE ESTABLISH A FIELD TRIAGE TREATMENT IN STAGING SITE FOR MULTI CASUALTY INCIDENTS. USUALLY WITHIN ONE TO TWO HOURS. THESE ARE ROUTINELY USED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IN THE PAST YEAR THE AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS WERE USED TO HELP MOVE PATIENTS FROM HEALTH FACILITIES DURING THE OROVILLE DAM EVACUATION. AND BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THROUGH OUR REGIONAL DISASTER MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATOR. AND THE LOCAL MEDICAL ON HEALTH OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR THAT IS EITHER A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OR AN EMS ADMINISTRATOR. ORGANIZED EVACUATION OF TO ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS AND MANY MORE SKILLED NURSING AN INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES. MOST NOTABLE WERE THE EVACUATION OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY PATIENTS FROM YOUNTVILLE VETERANS HOME. IN THE ENTIRE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. LOCAL HIM S. AGENCIES USED THEM NINETY TWO AMBULANCES INCLUDING FOURTEEN OF OUR AMBIENCE STRIKE TEAMS FROM FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONS. AND SIXTY PARATRANSIT VEHICLES TO EVACUATE APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED PATIENTS FROM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. THE SECOND TIER CONSISTS OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM SECOND A BOY WITHIN TWELVE HOURS BEGIN TO TREAT PATIENTS IN ANY LOCATION. THESE FLEXIBLE PATIENT CARE ACCESS CAN BE DEPLOYED AS A HEALTH CARE TEAM OF ANY SIZE AND TAKE ON HEALTH CARE MISSIONS. RANGING FROM ACUTE EMERGENCY CARE TO MANAGEMENT AND EVACUATE THE LONG TERM CARE PATIENTS. FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS HELPED WITH LOCAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. IN ADDITION PERSONNEL CAN BE PULLED FROM OUR DISASTER HEALTH CARE VOLUNTEER REGISTRY. THEY CURRENTLY CONTAINS OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND LICENSE PERSONNEL OF ALL TYPES INCLUDING THE LOCALLY ORGANIZED MEDICAL RESERVE CORES. THIRTEEN MRC UNITS WITH THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS WERE DEPLOYED FOR OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES INCLUDING THREE VETERINARY TEAMS WHICH WERE ROSTERED ON OUR DISASTER MEDICAL VOLUNTEERS SITE. THE MOBILE FIELD HOSPITAL PROGRAM AND WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MANY YEARS INTO IN THE PAST. WAS RECONFIGURED INTO THE MOBILE MEDICAL SHELTER PROGRAM THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR MULTIPLE USES. INCLUDING MEDICAL CARE A COMMAND CENTER OR MEDICAL SHELTERS. ONE COMPLETE SHELTER WITH DURABLE EQUIPMENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD. THE SECOND WAS BROKEN INTO SIX LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN EACH OF THE SIX MUTUAL AID REGION'S. THE THIRD IS BEING KEPT BY THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY FOR FLEXIBLE DEPLOYMENT. TWELVE OF OUR SHELTERS WERE RECENTLY USED DURING THE NOR CAL FIRES. TO HOUSE MULTIPLE ANCILLARY COMMAND SERVICES TO SUPPORT THE EVACUATED CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. MAYBE ALL STOP THERE AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE I MOVE ONTO OUR BUDGET AND TO ISSUE TO. I THINK AT THIS POINT IF YOU DISCONTINUE THE BIGGER OKAY. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN INCLUDES EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN THE AMOUNT OF THIRTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION. AND SIXTY NINE POINT NINE PERMANENT POSITIONS. OF THIS AMOUNT SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION OR FORTY FOUR PERCENT IS DELEGATED FOR STATE OPERATIONS. AND THE REMAINING TWENTY POINT NINE MILLION IS DELEGATED TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE. THE DEPARTMENT ONLY HAS ONE NEW WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENT UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS ISSUE TO. PM EST AUTHORITIES REQUESTING ONE PERMANENT POSITION AND A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TOTALING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND. WHICH INCLUDES ONE TIME FUNDING OF A HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX THOUSAND FOR IT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. AN ONGOING FUNDING OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND TO STRENGTHEN THE DEPARTMENTS. IT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE POLICY IN PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS. THE REQUEST RESULTS IN THE FINDINGS OF AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT BY THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT CYBER NETWORK DEFENSE TEAM IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW DEMONSTRATED THAT THE M. S. AUTHORITY LACKS SUFFICIENT IT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SUPPORT STAFFING LEVELS TO KEEP UP WITH STATE POLICY IN PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ENSURE IT. INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY WEBSITE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PARTICIPATION. IN STATE LEVEL AN AGENCY WIDE IT INITIATIVES. SO THE POSITION BEING REQUESTED WILL INITIALLY REMEDIATE THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT FINDINGS AND MANAGED IN THIS AS THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. ONGOING THE REQUESTED POSITION WILL DEVELOP IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR SECURITY PROGRAM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE I SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA WHEN IT COMES. SEEING NONE. WILL NOW HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE AND ISSUE TO.

IS THERE A CENTRALIZED LOCATION WHERE WE CAN SEARCH AND DETERMINE SOMEONE'S PREFERRED. INTENSITY OF LIFESAVING TECHNIQUES AND IF NOT IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS A STATE TO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFIT IN. FOLLOWING PEOPLE'S CHOICES FOR AND OF LIFE CARE. YES HERB FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE REMAINDER THE COMMITTEE WHO MAY NOT BE AS FAMILIAR WITH ME EXPLAIN THAT THE. SO CALLED THE POST FORM THE IS A A PHYSICIAN'S ORDERS FOR Y. SUSTAINING TREATMENT AND IT IS ACTUALLY. A SIGN THAT POSITION ORDER THAT REPRESENTS THE PATIENT'S WISHES AT THE END OF LIFE FOR THE INTENSITY OF INTERVENTION. IT IS SEPARATE FROM.

YOU KNOW IT IT ACTUALLY IS A PHYSICIAN'S ORDER RIGHT NOW IT IS IT THERE IS NO CENTRALIZED. LOCATION THAT WHERE THESE ARE STORED AND SO. YOU KNOW THE. MERGING SEE SERVICES IN A MASS AND OTHER. YOUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WHEN PATIENTS ARE BROUGHT IN OR NURSING HOMES LITERALLY RELY ON. FLUORESCENT PINK SHEET OF PAPER THAT WERE HAS THE PATIENT'S WISHES AND ASSIGNED ORDER. THE SP NINETEEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. DE YOU KNOW WAS A TEST TO TEST AT OR TO PILOT. A AT THE IDEA OF A POTENTIAL REGISTRY USING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE FOR THESE FORMS WHERE ARE YOU PROVIDER YOU WHETHER IT'S IN THE FIELD OR IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR IN A HEALTH FACILITY. COULD CALL AND RECEIVE INFORMATION EVER FIND OUT WHAT THE PATIENT'S WISHES WERE IF THAT PAPER WAS NOT AVAILABLE WITH THE PATIENT. THE TWO PILOT SITES THAT WE WERE CHOSEN WERE SAN DIEGO AND CONTRA COSTA. AND THEY ARE. THERE AFTER. SEVERAL DELAYS THEY ARE FINALLY. GETTING THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT TAKES IT PUTTING INPUT. INCLUDING THE FORMS INTO THEIR REGISTRIES AND HAVE A MECHANISM SET UP THEIR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. USE IT OR TYPES OF SYSTEMS WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO TEST BUT. THE NEXT STEP TAKING THIS AND EXPANDING IT STATEWIDE IT WILL BE A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE THAT WILL TAKE NOT ONLY A. BETTER. DESIGN OR BETTER. STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. BUT. ALSO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT WAS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION HAS BEEN WORKING ON END OF LIFE ISSUES FOR SOME TIME. AND WE HOPE ONCE DE WE GET THESE RESULTS THERE WILL BE ENOUGH INTEREST AND ADD DEMONSTRATE ENOUGH SUCCESS THAT WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND THE NEXT STEPS. THERE IS A LEGISLATIVE REPORT THAT IS. PART OF THIS LEGISLATION AND IT IS IN REVIEW RIGHT NOW IN FACT PENDING AS THOUGH IT SHOULD SHOW UP BUT I'M NOT SURE WHICH COMMITTEE IT'S GOING TO A. IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE SHORTLY. WELL I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A COPY OF THAT REPORT WHEN IT SHOULD BECOMES AVAILABLE. I'M REMINDED OF A PATIENT WHO HAD THAT TATTOO DO NOT RESUSCITATE ONTO THEIR CHEST.

SO HUNDRED TEN LAST YEAR AND TWO HUNDRED TWO ALREADY THIS YEAR SEE TO BE AGE RUNS RAN ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT MORE CONFIRMATORY TESTS THIS YEAR. INCLUDING ANTI VIRAL RESISTANCE TESTING AND I'M REALLY IS LOOKING OUT THE PERCENTAGE OF VISITS TO THE E. OUR ROOMS I'M AT MUCH GREATER PERCENTAGE IS ANOTHER ONE OF OUR INDICATORS FOR. THE SEVERITY OF THE FLAT. WE'VE ACTIVATED AGAIN OUR MEDICAL AND HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER AND TO SEND ALERTS IN THIS YOUR COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS GOVERNMENT.

ARE ARE EXPERTS IN THE PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE DETAIL BUT WE AS YOU KNOW WE ARE TASKED WITH REGULATING AND LICENSING CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS. OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY IN IMPLANTING THIS IS THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH. WE HAVE ISSUED OUR EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND HAVE BEGUN ISSUING TEMPORARY LICENSE AS. AS OF JANUARY FIRST SO AND THEY'LL PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WITH FAME DESCRIBE A PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY. WE HAVE ALSO EMBARKED ON AN UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND I HAD TO IMPLEMENT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION COMING CAMPAIGN. THEY ENTERED INTO. A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS BURST FOR A MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE OFFICE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY TO ADDRESS THE.

AND WE ARE WORKING ON UP CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NEW LAW WHAT WHAT REALLY IS THE NEW LAW WHAT DOES ENCOMPASS ASSOCIATED PENALTIES AND RISK THAT SIDE OUT PROP SIXTY FOUR. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THOSE RISKS OF CANNABIS USE TO YOUTH AND PREGNANT BREASTFEEDING WOMEN AND THOSE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AT THE CENTER OF THE LET'S TALK CANNABIS CAMPAIGN IS FORMATIVE RESEARCH. AND SO WE DO HAVE A WEBSITE UP AND RUNNING NOW WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO WORK ON THE YOUTH AND THE PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING WOMEN TO UNDERSTAND CONSUMPTION PATTERNS ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS. IN ORDER TO GUIDE OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN OF THIS CAMPAIGN INCLUDES A WEBSITE TOOL KIT.

THANK YOU IN HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE PROGRAM ACT SIR EXPERTS WHO WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH BACKGROUND ON THEIR PROGRAMS ADDRESS YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND REVIEW. THE CURRENT PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE L. L. ANYTHING'S. PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE THREE AT THIS TIME PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. WELL YOU MENTIONED. ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND OPIOID DEATHS ARE. DO WE HAVE A MORE EXACT NUMBER THAN THAT WE HAVE HAD AND HOW WE HOW WE TRACKING THOSE I KNOW THAT. INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL EXAMINERS CORONERS WHATEVER. REAP YOU KNOW. ACTUALLY YOU. GATHER THIS DATA BUT IS IS THERE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY TRACKING THIS. SO WE RELY ON A SEVERAL DATA SOURCES AND I I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT WE IS VITAL RECORDS AND LOOK AT. AND YOU WHAT'S REPORTED ON THE DEATH RECORD WE ALSO HAVE A DASHBOARD WE USE THE CURE'S DATABASE AND. I HAVE A DASHBOARD AVAILABLE WITH A VARIETY OF INFORMATION SOURCES WHERE WE TRIED TO GET OUT THAT. AND. IF I COULD ADD TO IF YOU THE SPECIFICS OF THE THE TWO THOUSAND THAT THE SPECIFIC NUMBER. EXACT NUMBER WAS ONE THOUSAND NINE TWENTY FIVE AND I WAS AS OF THE COUNTY YOUR TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE INFORMATION THAT WERE POINT FROM A SUSAN WAS MENTIONING WAS. ARE OUR VITAL RECORDS STATISTICS SO FROM THE DEATH CERTIFICATES. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS AND DISCHARGE DATA FOR THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OUR SPED AND THEN AS WELL AS. INFORMATION ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG DATA FROM THE CURE SYSTEM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ADMINISTERS DEPENDED THOSE AREAS OF OR AND AND THAT'S ALL UP ON OUR DASHBOARD AS WELL IT'S GONNA CONSOLIDATED. PICTURE. SO DO YOU TRACK ALSO. I SEE OVER OVERDOSE DEATHS WE HAVE A NUMBER FOUR BUT THE NUMBER OF OVERDOSES SET MAKE IT INTO EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT REPORTED ANYWHERE AND. FOR THAT NUMBER SO ON THE DASHBOARD AGAIN ISN'T IT ON THIS A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS SO FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS RELATED OVERDOSE WAS THIRTY NINE HUNDRED ROUGHLY. AND THEN. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF DATA THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR MILLION APPEARED PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN THAT SAME TWENTY SIXTEEN CALENDAR YEAR. AND THAT'S AVAILABLE THERE AS WELL GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I KNOW WE'VE COMMUNICATED OFFLINE BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NICE TO ACTUALLY SAY IT IN A HEARING SETTING AS WELL SO I WOULD LIKE TO FORMALIZE. AN AGREEMENT IF I COULDN'T SEE HOW WE COULD MOVE FORWARD. I BELIEVE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE NEED TO RECEIVE REGULAR UP TO DATE INFORMATION REGARDING PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS HOW WE COULD CREATE A STATE OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH. WITH SPECIFIC DATA PATTERNS SO I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT IT MAY REVISE WE MAY HAVE A PLAN FOR THIS UPCOMING YEAR. TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US SPECIFIC DATA METRIC POINTS THAT WE CAN FOLLOW. AND TRACK ENTRANT. SPECIFICALLY IF I COULD TOM I DID WANT TO ASK BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S TIMELY NOW. HOW MANY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS HAVE WE HAD IN CALIFORNIA WHEN HAVE THEY BEEN? AND HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE DIED AT EACH. SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T COLLECT SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELATED TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WE DO HAVE ONE OF YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS IS RELATED TO FIREARM DEATHS WE DO. IN OUR ANNUAL REPORTS A COUNTY HEALTH STATUS PROFILES REPORT IN IN THAT REPORT EVERY APRIL WE DO. REPORT OUT ON THE NUMBER OF FIREARM RELATED DEATHS WHICH AND BETWEEN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN YEAR WAS ROUGHLY THREE THOUSAND. BUT RELATED TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WE DON'T COLLECT THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION ANECDOTAL LEAVE THE LAST ONE I RECALL WAS DOWN IN SAN BERNADINO ON IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR WHERE UNFORTUNATELY TEACHER AND STUDENT WERE KILLED. BY THE TEACHER'S HUSBAND. BUT WE DON'T COLLECT THAT INFORMATION WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS EDUCATION DEPARTMENT JUST TO SEE IF THERE'S INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT AS FAR AS OUR DEPARTMENT WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY. WHO WANT A TRACK THAT INFORMATION? FOLLOWING UP ON OUR QUESTION THAT WE HAD ON OPIOIDS YOU HAD MENTIONED THE NALOXONE PROJECT WHERE. PHARMACISTS ARE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE IT. OF NALOXONE TO PATIENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING OPIOIDS. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD SPECIFIC DATA ON HOW THOSE PATIENTS ARE DOING THEMSELVES. IF THEY HAVE HIGHER OR LOWER RATES OF OVERDOSES COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION. SO THAT WE CAN ANALYSE THE PROJECT GOING FORWARD. I DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER TODAY BUT AND WE WILL ON ASK THE PROGRAM TO GET THAT BACK TO YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE DECISIONS AS WELL AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THE SUBCOMMITTEE CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE METRICS? WITH THAT STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR. THINK GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MONA COME AROUND THIS TIME THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION. I'LL START WITH AN OVERVIEW. OF THE CENTER FOR CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION IS ORGANIZED IN THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS. THE YOU NEVER CHRONIC DISEASE AND INJURY CONTROL. THE UNIT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE. AND THE OFFICE OF PROBLEM GAMBLING. THE CENTER CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PROGRAMS. AND AN APPROXIMATE BUDGET OF FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY STAFF. OUR MAIN FOCUS IS ON PREVENTION EFFORTS SPECIFICALLY ON ACTIVITIES SUCH AS EVALUATION POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. SURVEILLANCE PROMOTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATION. YOU WILL NOTE SPECIFIC PROGRAMMATIC HIGHLIGHTS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. AT THIS POINT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CENTER OR I'M HAPPY ALSO JUST MOVE FORWARD IN ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE PART OF SECTION FOUR AROUND. BY A MONITORING ALZHEIMER'S AND PARKINSON'S REGISTRY. THINK IF. RIGHT BIOMONITORING. SO IN TERMS OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN INCREASE. AB ONE TO TO KIND OF START OFF A LITTLE WOULD PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT BY WATCHING PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. BY LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. BY MONITORING IS THE MEASUREMENT OF CHEMICALS IN A PERSON'S BODY FLUIDS AND TISSUE INCLUDING BLOOD OR URINE. IT TELLS THEM ON OF THE CHEMICAL THAT ACTUALLY GETS INTO PEOPLE FROM ALL SOURCES AIR SOIL WATER. OR COMBINED. BECAUSE IT THIS BY A MONITORING CAN BE PRO PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION AND HOW MUCH EXPOSURE TO TOXIC. CHEMICALS A PERSON HAS. THE BIO MARCHING CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. IS A COLLABORATION OF THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL. IN A WE HAVE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. IN TERMS OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN INCREASE. THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS THAT WERE USED TO WITH THOSE OF FUNDING RESOURCES ONE WHAT'S AROUND EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. WERE WE GATHERED INFORMATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS ACROSS COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO EDUCATED COMMUNITIES AND HOW BY HIM ON A TEAM WORKS AND IDENTIFY WAYS IN WHICH BY MONITORING CALIFORNIA CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE. FINING WILL ALSO PRODUCED A BIANNUAL NEW SLATER. FURTHERMORE THE FUNDING SUPPORTED ENVIRONMENT AND BIOMONITORING FIELD WORK STUDY. THE STUDY ASSESSED THE LEVELS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS IN THE VIETNAMESE POPULATION IN SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA. IT ALSO SUPPORTED LABORATORY RESEARCH AND EQUIPMENT. THAT ENHANCE OR WAS PART OF THE. STUDIED THE BY ONE CAN STUDY. CURRENTLY THE DATA IS BEING. PRETTY MUCH ANALYZE AND FINALIZE STE FROM THE VIETNAMESE POPULATION STUDY IN SAN JOSE. WE WILL FOLLOW UP PROVIDING EDUCATION TO THE COMMUNITY. AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON UP PREVENTION INFORMATION ON WHAT WE LEARNT. IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS CAN MOVE FORWARD GREAT. VETERANS OF THE ALZHEIMER'S FUNDING. LIBERTY BACKGROUND ON THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROGRAM. THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TANK CALIFORNIA ELSE AMHERST EASY CENTERS. WE WORK TO REDUCE THE HUMAN BURDEN ECONOMIC COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AL SAMAR'S. WE ALSO WORK TO EDUCATE STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY ABOUT THE AL SOMERS DISEASE. THE ONE TIME INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS USED TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL OUR REGION EDUCATION AND AL SAMAR'S. EVALUATE THE EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE EFFORTS. AND ALSO WE PUT IN PLACE AND NOW SUMMERS TOOLKIT. THE TOOLKIT IS TO HELP CLINICIANS IDENTIFY SITUATIONS WHERE ELSE AMHERST IZZY'S IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD. SPECIFICALLY THE TOOK IT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PRACTITIONERS WITH METHODS TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS. COMPLETED DETAILED ASSESSMENT. AND INITIATE PROPER REFERRALS. CDP H. WORK WITH THE ALZHEIMER'S ON CENTERS TO ACTUALLY CREATE THIS TOOLKIT CURRENTLY IT IS IN DRAFT FORM. AND WE IT'S EXPECTED TO. WORKS BECKETT TO BEGIN PILOTS AND. THIS SUMMER. MOVING ON UP THERE NO QUESTION AS TO ITEM NUMBER TWO QUESTION A TO EXCUSE ME. RIGHT THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE REGISTRY. SO OVER THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS. WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST PATH IS TO MEET. THE QUICKLY APPROACHING DEADLINE OF THE REGISTRY. THIS INCLUDES CONVENING WHAT STAKEHOLDERS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL TO GET A SENSE OF THE DATA NEEDS THAT WE NEED IN THE STATE REGARDING PARKINSON'S. IN ADDITION WE'VE MET WITH OTHER STATES SUCH AS YOU TALK TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR OWN REGISTRY PLATFORMS AND THAT TYPE OF THE MEASUREMENTS THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW TRYING TO COLLECT. IN ADDITION THE TEAM IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON MEDIAN. FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS OF THE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REQUIREMENT TO START COLLECTING INCIDENTS ON PARKINSON'S. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT. ON IT DUE APRIL FIRST TO START POSTING INFORMATION ON THE REQUIREMENT ON A WEB SITES OR ACTIVELY WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF A POTENTIAL DATA OF REGISTRY. WE ARE CONCLUDING THAT THE BEST PATH FOR S. CONSIDERING HOW QUICKLY THIS IS APPROACHING IS TO LOOK AT AN INTERNAL SOLUTION. WERE LITEON AND HAVE MET WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT. TO IDENTIFY WHAT MIGHT WORK BEST CONSIDERING THE BUDGET AND THE TIMELINE IN WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IS. ATTENTION THE EXPLORING OF THE MODEL THAT CAL RABIH USES FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. SO. MORE TO REPORT ON YOU ON AND WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE TO. AND THE FUTURE. QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ARE THERE IS ALSO A QUESTION ABOUT THE COST ESTIMATE TO ESTABLISH A FOR REG A FULL PARKINSON'S REGISTRY. AT THIS POINT AND I ANALYZE SEEN A WHERE WE ARE WITH OF THE PARKINSON'S REGISTRY WERE ESTIMATING A COST OF ABOUT. TEN TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE RANGE WOULD REALLY BE ABOUT FOUR TO SIX MILLION OF ONE TIME TO REALLY BUILD THE AUTOMATED INFRASTRUCTURE. ALL OF FOUR TO SIX MILLION AN ONGOING. TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF FOR HOSPITALS TO REPORT COMPLETE TIMELY IN CLEAN DATA. AND ABOUT TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING UP FOR OVERSIGHT SURVEILLANCE. DATA WHERE I'M HOUSE DESIGN. AND NOT REPORTING. ITEM NUMBER THREE. NUTRITION EDUCATION OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS NEON UP. YUP SUPPORTS A COMPREHENSIVE MORE TIGHT STRATEGY FOR OBESITY PREVENTION BY FOCUSING ON POLICY SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE STRATEGIES. THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED STAFF. THE FUNDING PRIMARILY COMES THROUGH OF INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF-SOCIAL SERVICES. THE FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COME SPRING NINETY STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE USDA. AND IT'S ROUGHLY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. YUP ALSO HAS FUNDING FROM THE SENATE FOR DISEASE CONTROL. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND FUNDING FROM THE PREVENTIVE HEALTH. AND HEALTH SERVICES BLOCK GRANT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE TOTAL PROGRAM BUDGET FROM THE UP IS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ME UP HAS A UNIQUE. APPROACH BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A WE OPERATE THROUGH A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT MODEL. SO WE FUND FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS UP TO SIXTY A LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO REALLY UNDERGO AND DO A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY WORKAROUND I SNAP AT EDUCATION. PRIMARILY WE FOCUS ON EDUCATION SO. WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS ARE ON DIETARY GUIDELINES. WE ALSO AS YOU. MIGHT KNOW WOULD DO A LOT OF MEDIA AND MESSAGING CAMPAIGNS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING AND. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING TO COMMUNITY IN STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE DO A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION DESIGNS BOTH ON OUR MEDIA EFFORTS AND AND ALSO CREATE INSTRUMENT TOOLS. OF FOR OUR PROGRAMS AND THEN STATEWIDE SURVEYS ON ON EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. QUESTIONS. AYE WORLD BUT AFTER. ARE YOU DONE PRESENTING. I'M PRESIDENT I'M DONE ISSUE FOR IT LOOKS TO BERMAN A FINANCE ILIO ANY COMMENTS ON ISSUE FOR. SEEING NONE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE FOR. WILL BRING BACK THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. BECAUSE HOPING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ENDING IN MORE ON THE NUTRITION EDUCATION AND OBESITY PREVENTION BRANCH. CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE HOW WE'RE DOING. AS A STATE. ARE WE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IS THE. INVESTMENT. ARE WE GETTING A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT WITH. THE CURRENT SPENDING. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WHEAT WE KNOW THAT NATIONALLY OUR SNAP EDUCATION PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY WAS. WELL KNOWN WE PRODUCE SOME OF WE HAVE AWARDS FOR THE MEDIA CAMPAIGNS THAT WE PRODUCE WERE ALSO VERY AWARE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND TRY TO DO A LOT OF OUR. EDUCATION AROUND YOU KNOW TARGETING COMMUNITY SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. IN TERMS OF OUR EFFORTS IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OBESITY WERE KIND OF WATCHING A STAGNANT APPROACH WHEN ON TERMS OF THE DATA. THAT IN GENERAL FOR US WE CONSTANTLY GET RECOGNIZED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS NATIONALLY FOR THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE. GREAT OF WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE AND GO FOR THE. RIGHT. ISSUE FIVE THE TOBACCO TAX POP NINETY NINE ABOUT FIFTY SIX. SO THE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM OUR ARMY SOLDIER PROP NINETY NINE REVENUE CHANGES AND PROP FIFTY SIX TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. SO I'M SPECIFICALLY FOR A CHANGES HER PROPOSITION NINETY NINE WE SAW A DECREASE AN APPROPRIATION FOR AND THE HEALTH EDUCATION ACCOUNT FOR YEAR SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN AND THEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN. THERE'S A DECREASE IN APPROPRIATION AND AMOUNTS OF ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE REDUCTION ON IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL IMPACT ACTIVITIES PERTAINING TO MEDIA EVALUATION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE. SPECIFICALLY FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FIFTY SIX EXCUSE ME IT'S A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO DECREASE APPROPRIATION. DUE TO FOUR QUARTERS OF UP REVENUE AVAILABLE VERSUS FIVE QUARTERS IN REVENUE AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT THERE IS A DECREASE IN APPROPRIATION AND THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TOBACCO PREVENTION AND CONTROL ON ACCOUNT. THIS WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN APPROPRIATION FOR ACTIVITIES PERTAINING TO MEDIA EVALUATION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE. MON. AND THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO FUNDING SOURCES. AND YOU KNOW FOR US WHEN AND WE LOOK AT PROPOSITION NINETY NINE AND SOME OF THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES THAT THAT HAS REALLY ENTAILED. HAS REALLY HELPED BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR THE TOBACCO AND CAN. PREVENTION CONTROL PROGRAM. THERE IS KEY AYE AREAS OF FOCUS FOR US THROUGH PROP NINETY NINE THAT HAVE BEEN. ON IT SOLIDIFY BECAUSE OF THE FINDING INCLUDING MEDIA EVALUATION. PREVENTION EFFORTS AT THE LOCAL AND COMMUNITY LEVEL. FOR WITH PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING HAS HOW DO SIGNIFICANT IN CRITICAL ROLE IN EXPANDING AND ALL THE MEN TEAM THAT REALLY WHAT PROP NINETY BACK HAS BUILT FOR US. WHAT I MEAN SPECIFICALLY FROM THAT IS THAT? YOU KNOW WITH PROP NINETY NINE WE WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP MEDIA CAMPAIGNS IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE. THAT WERE TRANSLATED INTO MULTIPLE LANGUAGES WHAT PROP FIFTY SIX WERE ABLE TO BUILD OFF OF THOSE ACTIVITIES AND NOT ONLY CONTINUE THE WORK AROUND. OTHER MEDIA CAMPAIGNS IN TRANSLATING PAY ACTUALLY TARGETING PRIORITY POPULATIONS SUCH AS THE GAY LESBIAN BISEXUAL COMMUNITY THE ASIAN POPULATIONS. AND WERE ALSO NOT REALLY ADDRESSED SEEN EMERGING ON ISSUES IN TOBACCO CONTROL LIKE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. SO WHAT WERE YOU USING AND THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT OUR APPROACHES LOOKING AT A WILL HAS BEEN BUILT HISTORICALLY WITH PROPER NINETY NINE AND REALLY IDENTIFYING PRIORITY POPULATIONS AND EMERGING ISSUES MOVING FORWARD TO PROP FIFTY SIX. BOTH COMBINED. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA JOH NA COMMENTS ON ISSUE FIVE. AND A PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE. SAYING NONO BRING IT TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST HAVE ONE IT'S. FOR YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON PAGE TWENTY THREE OF OUR HANDLE IT SAYS THAT. WE HAVE FORTY MILLION INVESTED IN PHYSICIAN TRAINING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

STATE THAT THE JUST RECENTLY AS A MATTER OF COMMENT. IN BURMA WORKING GROUP WORKED WITH THE YES TEAM COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY THE. BILLING RATES THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS LIKE HAS. BOTH. TO IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT OF LEAD TEST DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS BUILT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS FOR LET TESTING FOR MEDI CAL KIDS WHO SHOULD BE TESTED WHEN THEY'RE ONE AND TWO. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. EVEN WITH VARIOUS ADJUSTMENTS SUCH A SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THOSE KIDS. THEY SHOULD BE GETTING TESTED ARE ACTUALLY GETTING TESTED AND SO IT JUST ILLUSTRATES COME A PROBLEM MORE HAVING RIGHT NOW WITH LUCK WITH LEAD TEST RATES AND. TRYING TO GET HOME FULL COMPLIANCE AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY ALL THE KIDS ARE AT RISK. SO AGAIN WE JUST SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THIS SOME PROPOSAL AND ALSO WAY AND ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER ACTION. IN THEIR MARMOL JUSTICE COALITION FOR WATERS WILL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS STEPHANIE MACKLIN I AM. A. RESEARCHER WITH THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WE ARE ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. OUR CONCERN IS THAT NGUYEN TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE NUMBER OF A ONE AND TWO YEAR OLDS WHO SHOULD BE TESTED. ORBIT AND IS AND THAT AMAZINGLY LOW NUMBER IT MEANS THAT ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO SHOULD BE TESTED ARE NOT BEING TRUSTED. OR DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THOSE CHILDREN WILL PAY FOR WITH THIS ALL FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN TERMS OF POVERTY AND LOST OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE BLOOD POISONING. SO DEEPLY AFFECTS SO MANY THINGS IN THEIR LIVES PARTICULARLY THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN THANK YOU BEGIN. I UNANSWERED URIAH BEHALF OF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS AND WE SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS. PROPOSAL WELL IT IS LETTERS PRIMARILY LOOKED AT AS A NEUROTOXIN IT ALSO HAS. HEAVY METALS HAVE SOME CONCERN FOR BREAST CANCER CAUSATION AS WELL SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AS WELL. THINKING UP. YOU GET A CREDIT WITH AN ARCH RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST ENERGIES HIS WORK WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS IN FLINT MICHIGAN. OUGHT TO RESPOND TO THE LEAD CRISIS AND SECURE SAFE WATER TAUGHT US MANY LESSONS ONE OF THEM WAS THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE MEDICAL IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY. TO OUTRIGHT LEAD EXPOSURES AND SOUND THE ALARM WHEN ACTION IS NEEDED WE SUPPORT THIS REQUEST TO AMEND BELIEVE IT'S REALLY VALUABLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN TO BE PROPERLY TESTED PHILIP EXPOSURES THINKING. THANK YOU. I THINK THERE WERE SOME FURTHER QUESTIONS I HAD AND SO IF YOU WANT I ANSWER THEM NOW THAT BE GREAT IN THE WILL BRING IT BACK TO US. SO WE HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE PERCENT OF MEDI CAL KIDS THAT ARE BEING TESTED ON. ARE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DONE CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION BRANCH DOES NOT HAVE DATA ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN MEDI CAL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAW CLIP RECEIVES ELECTRONIC REPORTS DIRECTLY FROM THAT THE TORIES PERFORMING THE BLOOD LET TESS. CLIP IS NOT RECEIVE INSURANCE INFORMATION OR INCOME. THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS THAT INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN MEDI CAL. HOWEVER ON FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH THE COMMITTEE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXINS MATERIALS. REQUESTED THE DEPARTMENT HELPED HER SERVICES CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL CHILDREN BEING TESTED. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS WORKING WITH D. H. CS ON THE STATE I'M ACTION WILL BE REPORTING BACK THE RESULTS. QUESTION NUMBER TWO. I'M SINCE LAUREN THE CASE DEFINITION BLOOD LEAD TEST REPORTED TO CLIP. AND BEING PROCESSED WENT FROM SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. UNTIL THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND CASES. TWO SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE ON THE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I'M SORRY EMIGRATE THAT FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. FURTHERMORE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IDENTIFY AS A CASE OF LEAD POISONING HAS INCREASED MORE THAN THREEFOLD. FROM TWO HUNDRED TO OVER SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY CASES IDENTIFIED FROM JULY TWENTY SIXTEEN. THROUGH JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ENCOUNTERS BY OUR STAFF TO LOCAL PROGRAMS AND HOW PROVIDERS WENT FROM SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIFTEEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO AS YOU CAN SEE. THERE'S BEEN. AT DEFTLY AT INCREASE IN WORKLOAD AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BEING PROVIDED AS A RESULT OF THEIR LORENA AT THE CASE DEFINITION. NUMBER THREE. CURRENTLY FORTY NINE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ALLOCATED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN COMBINED CLIP IN FEDERAL MEDICARE HOW FINDING. THE COUNTY ALLOCATIONS ARE DETERMINED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH INCREASED SPELL LEVELS IN EACH COUNTY. THE NUMBER REPORTED MEDI CAL CHILDREN UNDER AGE SIX. AND THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND OLDER HOUSING. THAT IS THE METHODOLOGY USED BY THE PROGRAM. FOR COUNTY ALLOCATIONS LET ME JUMP IN FOR A SECOND YOU'RE SAYING NUMBER NOT PERCENTAGE. SO WOULDN'T THAT INHERENTLY FAVORED THE LARGER COUNTIES TO RECEIVE. MORE OF AN ALLOCATION. IS PERCENTAGE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THE PREVALENCE OF. THIS DISEASE PROCESS. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION YOU'RE BRING ENOUGH. CURRENTLY I I DON'T HAVE EXACTLY HOW THE FORMULAS BASED I CAN FOLLOW UP AND MAKE SURE I DON'T KNOW DOCTOR STAR THING IF YOU RECALL ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. NO SORRY FOR THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE HERE I'M I'M LOCKED MARK STAR DIPPY DIRECTOR FOR RONALD HEALTH AND. I WAS ACTING OVER THE CENTER YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR SO I MEMBER A FEW THINGS NOT TOO MUCH ANYMORE. BUT I THINK THE PROGRAM DOES TARGET OF RESOURCES BASED ON. OF THE NEED AND AS WELL AS POPULATION SO THAT THEY LOOK AT CENSUS DATA. THEY THE LOVE THE TARGETING IS BASED ON LOWER INCOME BECAUSE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TEND TO BE OLDER HOUSEHOLDS. AND YOU USE TOOLS LIKE THAT AS WELL. I'M. THIS ONE HITS A LITTLE CLOSE TO HOME IF IF I CAN I HAVE OBSERVED CODE IN MY COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE OVER TEN PERCENT OF KIDS WHO. HAVE LEAD TOXICITY. AND THAT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WERE. DRIVING RESOURCES TOWARDS THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE HELP THE MOST. AND REALLY WILL BE FOLLOWING A. B. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. BEST MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THAT. WE REACHED OUT TO THE AUTHOR. CHAIR OF THE STM HE HAS A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY TO SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE HAVE ASKED SO FAR. IF YOU WANTED TO ASK SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION TO HIS BILL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN. WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR REVISING THE REGULATIONS WILL YOU BE ABLE TO CONSULT WITH EXPERTS. ARE YOU GOING TO CREATE A WORKING GROUP OF EXPERTS TO ME ONCE OR REGULARLY WHAT'S THE PLAN GOING FORWARD. A QUESTION ABSOLUTELY OF THIS STATUTE DOES REQUIRE US TO ACTUALLY CONVENE BUT STAKEHOLDERS ME WHAT THE CLINICAL SECTOR. AND IDENTIFY WAYS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY STANDARDS AS A COMPREHENSIVE LIAM WITH INPUT FROM COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. WHAT'S THE TIMING FOR THE INITIATING OF THAT CONSULTATION OF EXPERTS. FOR US IDEALLY WE ACTUALLY ARE TRYING TO SAY WERE PLANNING ALREADY INTERNALLY OR USING EXISTING. NETWORKS THAT WE HAVE WERE ACTUALLY VERY WELL CONNECTED TO THE CLINICAL SECTOR IN COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS SO. OUR GOAL IS TO. CURRENY OUR TEAMS ALREADY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD A ONCE WE GET YOU KNOW THE SUPPORT IN PLACE FROM OUR STAFF WE'VE JUST A WILL BE READY TO START. MEDIAN AND CUT CONCEPTUALIZING MORE INTENTIONALLY WITH FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY LEVEL CAN INDIVIDUALS BE RECOMMENDED CAN INDIVIDUALS APPLY TO THIS WORKING GROUP. AND THAT'S A GREAT RECOMMENDATION AND DEFTLY WE CAN. I KNOW THAT THERE IS EXISTING STAKEHOLDER GROUPS ALREADY IN PLACE WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THEN SAID YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WILL TAKE THOSE WELL I WOULD LIKE IF YOU COULD TO WORK WITH MY OFFICE AS WELL AS. A CHAIRMAN QUIRKS OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS WORKING GROUP GOING FORWARD. I'M TIRED JUST HAD A QUESTION. IF I HEARD CORRECTLY FROM THAT THAT TESTIMONY. I'VE A QUESTION ABOUT WHY ONLY A TWENTY PERCENT OF THE KIDS ARE BEING TESTED FOR LEAD ITEM OF ITS. BIZZARE. A REAL SO LET ME LET ME BACK UP THE THE QUESTION WAS ASKING OF THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL CHILDREN. RIGHT INSTILL OUR DEPARTMENT. DOZEN MANAGE THAT MEDICAL CHILDREN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE. DE HTS DOES THAT WORK. WEEK RECEIVER LABORATORY DAY YEAH I'M BLACK BLOOD LEAD TESTS. AND WE DO A LOT OF OUR PREVENTION WORK A LOT OF OUR EDUCATION WORK. WHEN WE GET KIDS THAT ARE. LEAD POISONED WE CASE MANAGE THEM A WE PROVIDE OF FOR EXAMPLE AND GO TO THEIR HOMES TO BE PROVIDE ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTS. A BIT IN TERMS OF SPECIFICALLY THE MEDI CAL POPULATION. YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY THE NUMBERS FOR THAT POPULATION BECAUSE WE DON'T COLLECT INSURANCE OR. INCOME ON THAT LABORATORY DATA LIKE IT'S LABORATORY DATA DOESN'T COME WITH THAT INFORMATION RIGHT BUT BUT I GUESS MY MY. NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE IS IF ONLY TWENTY PERCENT OF THE KIDS ARE BEING TESTED SO WE JUST SAY OKAY IT'S THERE BEATEN THEIR TONY TWENTY PERCENT. I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. MAKING SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE TESTED AND IF ONLY TWENTY PERCENT OF THE KIDS ARE BEING TESTED WHO DO WE. INSISTS. UPON. THEM TESTING THAT MORE KIDS BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING THAT WHEN YOU TEST KITS WERE PROVIDED THE STATE IS PROVIDING MONEY FOR THOSE TESTS. AND IF THE MONEY IS NOT BEING USED FOR TESTING THEN WHERE IS THAT MONEY. THIS IS WILL WE DO KNOW FROM OUR DATA WHAT MIGHT HELP. WE CURRENTLY PROCESSES. FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND LEAD TEST OF CHILDREN UNDER AGE THREE. SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT DATA. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THREE CENSUS DATA APPROXIMATELY. FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY. THOUSAND CHILDREN. AGES ONE TO TWO ARE LIVING IN HOUSEHOLDS BELOW TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOU KNOW A POVERTY LEVEL. CIVIL FOR OUR DATE AND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE IS THAT WERE REACHING ABOUT SEVENTY TWO PERCENT. OF CHILDREN. WHO ARE LOW INCOME UNDER THREE YEARS AND EACH? SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS YOU I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE MEDICAL DATA BUT I CAN SPEAK TO THE LABORATORY DATA THAT WE HAVE NO. SO YES THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION THAT BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE IN GENERAL WHO DO I GO TO OR WHO DO WE GO TO TO. GET THAT DATA SINCE YOU CAN'T PROVIDED AND WHO. DO WE ENCOURAGE AYE IF YOU WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT MARKETS ARE TESTED. BECAUSE WHAT WHAT SOUNDS LIKE IN. THIS IS MY NOW MY SECOND YEAR BUT WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT YOU ONLY HAVE. CERTAIN POWERS YOU JUST. GET THE DATA BUT SO WHO IF SOMEONE CAN HELP ME COOL WE'VE GOAL TO ENCOURAGE TO FOR. MAKE SURE THAT THESE KIDS ARE BEING TESTED AND AGAIN I'M ASSUMING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE FUNDING FOR THESE TESTS AND IF THE TESTING IS NOT HAPPENING. THEN WHERE IS THE MONEY FOR THAT TESTING. I IT'S BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND SO AS OF FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. THE COMMITTEE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS. AND WE ACTUALLY HAD A HEARING WITH THEM AND THEY WORK TWENTY EIGHT CS TO ACTUALLY START DURING THE MATCH WITH DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH IS US. SO WERE ACT WE GONNA START MATCHING THE DATA TO TRY TO GET THAT ANSWER IF THAT'S HELPFUL. ALONG THOSE LINES THOUGH ARE FIFTH IN QUESTION WAS THAT BY STATUTE DPH IS TO PROVIDE BI ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE. IS IS DPH IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS MANDATE. I'M STILL A HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ONE OH FIVE TWO NINE FIVE STATES THAT CLIP. SHALL PROVIDE BI ANNUAL REPORTS DESCRIBING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CASE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS. AND MAKE THE REPORT AVAILABLE TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THE PUBLIC. AS SUCH ON OUR WEBSITE WE CURRENTLY DO HAVE REPORTS THAT OUTLINED BY JURISDICTION. AGE AND BLOOD LEAD ON CATEGORY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SO IT'S IT'S. FOR CLARIFICATION THE STATUE DOESN'T SAY. IT'S A BIANNUAL LED LEGISLATIVE REPORT IT STATES JUST A REPORT AND IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE HOW ACCURATE IS THAT DATA IF. ON FEBRUARY OR TODAY WERE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE. APPROPRIATE REAL TIME INFORMATION AND. WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE? SO THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROPOSED IS. DATA FROM OUR LABORATORY BLOOD LEAD TASK. SO IT AT A BREAK SADDAM BY EACH OF CHILD IN JURISDICTIONS SOMEWHERE THE COUNTY AND SO THAT IS VERY ACCURATE. I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PULL. WHAT INSURANCE PLAN THE CHILDREN ARE IN BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DON'T GET THAT DATA? RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ACTUALLY JUST THE CAN I FOLLOW UP AYE OF. IT. AGAIN I'M. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN REINFORCE AND SONYA YOU CAN. SHAKING HER HEAD AS IF YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ASK. WHO? IS IT THAT I CAN SEPARATE FROM YOU BUT WHO IS IT THAT WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION FROM AN AND AND IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE THESE TO. WHOEVER IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE BEING TESTED INCOME CONCERNED WE WE JUST HAD A BILL ON DEAD. AND WATER FOR KIDS AND WE CAN TEST BAD BUT BUT YET WE CAN PROVE WE HAVE. MY CONCERN IS THAT IF BUT THE KIDS ALREADY HAVE LEAD POISONING. OR SOME KIND OF LEAD IN THEIR SYSTEM AND WERE REQUIRING SCHOOLS NOW TO TEST FOR LEAD AND. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THESE KIDS ALREADY HAVE THE LEAD IN THE SYSTEM. ANYWAY MY POINT IS WHO I ASK AND WAIT WHERE CAN WE GET THE INFORMATION. I OF WHY. THERE'S ONLY TWENTY PERCENT OF THE KIDS BEING TESTED. YEAH LET ME LET ME LOOK IN TO THE SINK EFFECTIVE BECAUSE. I WAS NODDING MY HEAD BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT IS. WHY? AS OPPOSED TO. BREAKING THE DATA UP IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT WAYS IS TO FIND OUT WHY. THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING THE LEAD TESTING THAT THEY NEED. SO I DON'T I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW THIS INFORMATION OFF HAND BUT I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AND REPORT BACK TO YOU YES PLEASE AND AND IF WE COULD. BECAUSE. IT GOES BACK TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE SO WE HAVE THIS MONEY OUT THERE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE BEING USED FOR THESE TESTS AND IT'S NOT BEING USED AND IF WE'RE NOT USING THE MONEY THAN WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THAT MONEY. THAT'S NUMBER ONE BUT BUT ACTUALLY NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT I'M HAVING IS WIRED THESE KIDS NOT BEING TESTED AND IF WE CAN. AND LIKE I FORGET WHO THE WITNESS ONCE SAID. IF WE CAN HELP THEM HOW CAN WE HELP THEM IF THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. AND SO AGAIN ASIDE FROM YOUR IT YOUR DEPARTMENT. I NEED TO KNOW WHY AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE THE INFORMATION IN THE. YOU KNOW TIMELY FASHION SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE ROOT OF IT AND WHO DO WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS LIKE IT'S. I CAN JUST PROVIDE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THAT MAYBE COULD HELP A LITTLE BUT. THE TWENTY PERCENT IS OF MEDI CAL CHILDREN AS EDU BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD. HERE IN THE POCKET AND AND HER TESTIMONY. PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY. IT'S NOT ALL CHILDREN WE KNOW FROM THE NUMBERS THAT MISS MORALIS PRESENTED WE THINK THAT WE'RE REACHING A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE LOW INCOME CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT. AS YOU NOTED WHAT WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW UP WITH DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES AND. TRY AND FIGURE OUT. WHERE IT WAS ABOUT THE TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF MEDICAL KIDS AND AND WHAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS WHAT THE WHY IS AS AS SONYA MENTIONED? AND ALSO AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PAYMENT FOR THERE'S NOT A BLOCK OF MONEY SET ASIDE FOR THIS A MEDI CAL REIMBURSES FOR SERVICES SO. IF THE PHYSICIAN ISN'T. REQUESTING THE TEST WHICH IT IS PROBABLY THE REAL CHALLENGE HERE IF THEY'RE IN WITH THE RATES THAT LOW. THEN THERE IT'S NOT GETTING REIMBURSED BECAUSE THE TEST ISN'T BEING DONE. SO WE DO HAVE OUR PROGRAM HAS WHAT'S CALLED A TO SUPPORT IT. THE TORY GUIDANCE THAT WE PROVIDE TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. AND IT'S VERY MUCH GOES ALONG WITH SOME OF THE INTENT OF AB THIRTEEN SITE SIXTEEN TO REALLY ENHANCE THAT GUIDANCE IN ORDER TO. LOOK AT. VARIOUS RISK FACTORS IN CHILDREN AND MAKE IN THE PROVIDER MAKING THE DECISION. OF ASKING A PARENT TO GET THEIR CHILD LEAD TESTING OR QUESTION THAT BLOOD TESTS. SO THE AND ALL THOSE FACTORS GO INTO THIS AND. YOU KNOW THAT DUCKTALES NICELY WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST AS WELL AS WHAT IS REQUESTED TO THIS LEGISLATION. FINALLY IF I COULD A THE GOVERNOR AND HIS BUDGET IN JANUARY IS ESTABLISHING A HOME VISITING PROGRAM TO START JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND SEE IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP EDUCATE. THE NURSES AND PROVIDERS WHO WILL BE GOING INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES. TO IDENTIFY THE RISK FACTORS FOR. LEAD TOXICITY LEAD PAINT FLAKES. TOYS OF TANTRA TOLD WANTS TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE AS THIS HOME VISITING PROGRAMS BEING ROLLED OUT THAT THERE PROVIDED ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION THAT YOU CAN. WITH THAT. STAFFERS RECOMMENDED HOLDING ISSUE SEVEN OPEN AT THIS TIME AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE A. GONNA ASK IF WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE SPACE FOR HOCEIMA HERE THE. PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WAS SEMI WITH LABOR STATE COUNCIL. WE ARE PROVIDER WE ARE A TO OUR PERMISSION FROM TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE CURRY TRAINING IN THE. THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIALS WHAT SPECIFICALLY THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE LEAD ABATEMENT WHICH NORMALLY. THE MOST CASES BEING FOUND IN. OLDER HOMES HOLDER PAINTS IN SOME CASES IN THE DIE BEING USED FOR HOMES THAT WERE BACKED IN PLASTER IN PLACE. IT'S VERY VERY DIRTY TYPE WORK AND REQUIRES. A TRAINED WORKFORCE THAT FOR THE MOST PART IS VERY. LOW PAID. WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A PROBLEM SINCE PROVIDER ONCE AGAIN THAT. DUE TO THE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AND OTHER DISCUSSIONS. ARE RECENT PARTISAN NORTH OF COURSE NOW IN THE SELF. WE ARE FINDING THAT THERE'S SOME DELAYS OCCURRING. I'M GETTING A CERTIFICATION CARDS THE PROCESS IS VERY SIMPLE. WE TRAIN THE STATE THEN ISSUES THE CARDS. UP ON THE SUGGESTION ONCE WE DEMONSTRATING GOOD FAITH IS INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO REFORM THE WORK. OUR EMPLOYERS DO GOOD GROUP OF EMPLOYERS ARE RECORDING HAS SOME OF THESE PEOPLE IN PLACE THAT HAD THE TRAINING IN THE PAST. AND IN MANY CASES THESE PEOPLE THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THESE EMPLOYERS HAVE TO RE UP. AND THE DEPARTMENT DOES TAKE PRIORITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS SO THAT THERE'S NO INTERRUPTION WHATSOEVER. WE RECOGNIZE IN MANY CASES YOU HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE SOME AND SOME THESE EMPLOYEES. A WAY TO THE LAST TEN TEN DAYS THE TWELVE DAY GRACE PERIOD. IN IN WERE SCRAMBLING FOR IT. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A TIMEFRAME ALSO BY THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO ISSUE THESE. HE'S A CERTIFICATION CARDS WE HAVE EXPERIENCING QUITE A BIT OF A DELAY IN SOME CASES. THREE FOUR FIVE SIX MONTHS. OP WHICH SLOWS DOWN THE PROCESS. AGAIN IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND. AN INNATE OR. YOU KNOW GIVE THE ONCE WERE RE UPPING ON TRAINING IT'S ONE THING WE STILL HAVE A GROUP OF FOLKS OUT THERE THE FOR THE MOST PART. ARE BEING DELAYED AND UNTIL THE CERTIFICATES ARE RICHES INDIVIDUALS AND NOT ABLE TO WOULD WORK THE EMPLOYERS UNABLE TO HIRE. IN INCREASED OUR WORK TO BE ABLE TO FIX WITH A DEMAND. AND WE'RE TRYING A FIVE FIGURE OUT A POSSIBLE WAY TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. I'M VERY MUCH AWARE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A PERIOD OF TIME WHICH DEPARTMENT IS IS TO BE DOING THIS BUT I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A FEW IF THERE'S A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALL SORTS CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING. WHOSE AFFAIRS TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE PERFORMING AND THE ISSUANCE OF CARDS. WE HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU UP IF WE GET OF THE DEPARTMENT COMEBACK FORWARD AND. WE HAD A FEW QUESTIONS ASKED. IN THE ITINERARY AND WANDERING IF YOU CAN TRUST US. YEAH THERE IS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF THE PROGRAM ON SALE DELAYED RELATED CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM IS PRETTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. EXCUSE ME THE LRC IS AUTHORIZED BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY USEPA. TO RUN SUCH A PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY IT ACCREDITS TRAINED PROVIDERS AND CERTIFIES INDIVIDUALS CAN TO SAFELY IDENTIFY AND CONDUCT EMBAYMENT ACTIVITIES. THE LRC PROGRAM CERTIFIES APPROXIMATELY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS EACH YEAR. IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING. SORRY I'M RECOVERING FROM A POT. SO THE FEDERAL GRANT FOR. IT'S TO FUNDING SOURCES ONE IS UP THROUGH THE. USEPA FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THEN THERE'S A DELAY RELATED CONSTRUCTION SPECIAL FIND WHICH FINDS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE LRC SPENT HER FINEST GENERATED BY THE CERTIFICATION APPLICATION FEE EVER US SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER APPLICATION. THINK. CURRENTLY THE APPLICATION TURN AROUND TIME FOR US IS AVERAGES ABOUT SIXTY DAYS. PER STATUE  <u><c.green>WE HAVE A</c></u> HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS TO TURN AROUND THERE. FULL APPLICATION PROCESS. CP RECOGNIZES DEPRECATION PROCESS. IS REALLY IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENTS AND EXPLORATION AS SUCH WE ARE MEETING ACTIVELY WITH OUR TEAM AND OUR STAFF. TO LOOK AT QUALITY PERMIT EFFORTS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCIES. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALLOW INCOMES. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE EIGHT AT THIS TIME. SINGING ON A BRING IT TO THE DYESS OR POST THEM HERE YET. CIRCULAR QUICKLY OB I JUST WANT ME TO COMMENT. I JUST FIND IT THAT WE SHOULD. AS POLICY IN CALIFORNIA TO CONSIDERATION. IF WE TO BE DEPENDING ON GRANTS. WITH DISCRIMINATES VERSION DC A SOMEWHAT SCARY. AND SO PLEASE SHERMAN PLEASE CONSIDER THAT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD NO DEPARTMENT REAP STREAMLINED IN HIS QUEST FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. OF THE HAVING COMING IN. WAS ALWAYS OF THE NUMBER AND I DO. BUT THAT'S OF THE REALLY TING CONSIDERATION. ACTUALLY A QUESTION I DIDN'T DON'T THINK IT WAS COMPLETELY ADDRESSED REGARDING MR HE HAS. COMMENTS ABOUT SOMETIMES IS APPLICATIONS ARE TAKING THREE TO FIVE MONTHS SO THAT'S CLEARLY FIVE MONTHS IS CLEARLY OUTSIDE YOUR STATUTORY DEADLINES TO. YOU HAVE THE SAID THE MOST THAT WERE BE DONE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS BUT YOU HAVE UP INTO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. YOU DOING SEVEN THOUSAND HERE. HE SAID. THE SEVEN THOUSAND RENEWALS OR SEVEN THOUSAND NEW ONES BECAUSE I HE'S TALKING. I THINK IT MISTER HERE DEMOCRAT YOU'RE TRYING OUT THE NEW ONES CORRECT NO IS AND THE REAL AND AND THE RE UP SO SO HOW DOES IT TAKE TO DO THE RE UPS. BECAUSE THAT SHOULD BE PRETTY SIMPLE. AND HOW LONG'S IT TAKING TO DO THE NEW ONES. SO WE PROCESS BOTH THREE NEW LAWS AND NEW. AND SAME FORMAT THAT'S WHY CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER METHODS FOR WE CAN. MAYBE CONSIDER HAVING A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY FOR RENEWALS FOR SINCE YOU YEAH I'M JUST NEW APPLICATIONS. SO IF ONE COMES INTO THE QUEUE THERE'S NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN OF RENEWAL OR A NEW APPLICATION SO THE APPLICATIONS IDENTICAL FROM YEAR TO YEAR WHETHER IT'S A NEW ONE A RENEWAL. FOR THE MOST PART YES YOU THERE'S A SECTION WHERE YOU SPECIFY IF IT'S A RENEWAL. SO I'M JUST I'M JUST PUZZLED WHY IT TAKES SO LONG. YEAH WE WE UNDERSTAND AND WE. ARE LOOKING INTERNET WENT OUT TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THE HOW LONG IT'S TAKING THAT'S ONLY RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN CURRENTLY THE AVERAGE THIRTY DAY PROCESS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO YOU KNOW THAT EXPLOIT SEES ME SIXTY DAY PROCESS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO EXPLORE. AND I GUESS I'M PUZZLED BECAUSE I COOK I CAN GO ONLINE AND. AND I WILL DO THAT IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO TO RENEW MY DENTAL LICENSE. AND IT WILL BE RENEWED VERY VERY QUICKLY. SO I'M REALLY PUZZLED WE'VE GOT FOLKS THAT THAT WE GOT A NEED FOR THESE FOLKS IN ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRE AREAS. AND AND AND WE GOT A NEED. FOR THE FOR THEM TO BE OUT IN THE WORKPLACE YET THEY MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT THREE TO FIVE MONTHS FOR THEIR CERTIFICATIONS. I'M SORRY I JUST DON'T FIND THAT TO BE TIMELY AND OR ACCEPTABLE. BUT. IF I MAY YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION WHAT WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG. SO WITH A COUPLE OF FACTORS. AND LOOKING. AT OUR DATA IS SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS WITH APPLICATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL HAD A PROCESS STE. ON PAPER SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE IT WE DON'T HAVE AN ELECTRONIC PLATFORM RIGHT. SO THAT PROCESS ON PAPER. UNFORTUNATE WHAT HAPPENS TO IS WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UP IF THERE'S INCONSISTENCIES OR INACCURACIES IN THE APPLICATION. SO WE HAVE TO THEN FOLLOW UP AND IT EXTENDS SOME OF THE TIMELINE. ON FRIES SO. WITH SOME OF THOSE UP FOR US FOR EXPLORING DIFFERENT AUTOMATION SOLUTIONS TO TRY TO. MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS ONLINE FOR EXAMPLE OR IN THAT WHEN I DO EAT THAT IT'S A INFORMATION IS. NOT PLEASE CORRECTLY THAT APPLICATION WILL LET YOU MOVE FORWARD AND BY THE TIME WE GET IT IF IT'S VERY ACCURATE WE CAN JUST MOVE FORWARD AND PROCESSES. FROM OUR INTO. BUT. WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THESE APPLICATIONS OVER THE YEARS AS WELL. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE PROCESS SEEN ABOUT SIX THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND MADE AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE PROCESSING ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED. ON AS IF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A DEMANDING. A DEMAND AN INCREASE IN DEMAND WE HAVE THE SAME ALSO ON WERE FULLY STATS SEVEN F. T. E. SO THAT HASN'T CHANGED FOR US IN QUITE SOMETIME. WALL THEN MISS RADIO AS THE TIME FRAME CHANGED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THREE TO SIX MONTHS. WHY THINK IS WAS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED STEVE? THE MORE ACTIVITIES BECOME OF THE FORESTS KNOWLEDGE OF THAT HE WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STILL JUST YET. BUT I THINK IT'S I THINK IT. I DEMAND SOURCE SPEAK. I JUST THAT AGAIN I THINK. THE WAIT TIME HAS BEEN. I MEAN A SLOW TIME AS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE IN THREE MONTHS. AND SOME OTHER TIMES I MEAN RECENTLY FOR THE LAST COUPLE THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN PROMISING ONE OFFER US WITH US FOR A LONG TIME NOW. IN ITS ITS IT IT THAT JUST KEEPS INCREASING IN TIME. BIZARRE TWENTY DEFY Y.. IF WERE BUT I I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL THE PROPOSAL EITHER THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO CHANGE THE FORMAT FOR ALL THOSE ARE JUST UPPING THE. THE RENEWAL PROCESS THAT WOULD BE SUCH A CONSIDERATION BUT DIFFERENT AND RENEWING YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE I GUESS. BUT I THINK THAT I JUST TRULY BELIEVE SOMETHING IS TO BE DONE TO EXPEDITE THE SYSTEM BILL MORE CONSISTENT. CUT CONFIRMABLE COULD HE SAID YOU HAVE SEVEN FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS TO DO THESE PROCESS PROCESSES. YES SO THAT'S ABOUT THAT'S ABOUT A THOUSAND PER PERSON. SURE WE'VE GOT YOU DIVIDE HAPPY COUPLE HUNDRED WORK DAYS A YEAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE APPLICATIONS PER PERSON. DAY. AND WE CAN'T MOVE OUT OF ANY FASTER. RIGHT NOW AGAIN I'M JUST YOU KNOW WERE AVERAGING ABOUT SO LONG AS THE APPLICATION HOW MANY PAGES IS APPLICATION. ON YOU KNOW I'M FORTUNATE ALL HAVE IT ON THE RIGHT NOW SO WE CAN BE ABLE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY. YEAH SURE YOU KNOW HOW LONG THIS APPLICATION MISTER HERE. A LOT OF IT'S THEMEDICAL HISTORY PRIVATE TOLD THE JOKE IS. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SENSING FROM THE COMMITTEE SO FAR IS. WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A MORE STREAMLINED. APPROACH. AND WE WOULD LIKE BY ME REVISION FOR YOU TO REPORT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON A MORE STREAMLINED APPROACH. AND IF I MAY I THINK SIXTY DAYS TOO LONG IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO REALLY SHORTEN IT AT THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ONTO ISSUE NOT THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND DISTINGUISH SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. TO PRESENT A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL TO INCREASE FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. MY NAME IS JANET NOODLE MAN AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM AND POLICY AT BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS AND CO FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF OUR CAMPAIGN FOR SAFE COSMETICS. THE CPP IS THE ONLY NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOCUSED SOLELY ON PREVENTING BREAST CANCER BY IDENTIFYING AND ELIMINATING CHEMICALS AND COMMERCE. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT ARE LINKED TO AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES AND AT FIRST HEALTH EFFECTS. AS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SPONSORS OF SB FOUR EIGHTY FOR THE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. I AM HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IMPORTANT CONSUMER AND WORKER RIGHT TO KNOW PROGRAM IS MORE NEEDED AND MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER. AND URGENTLY DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION AND YOUR SUPPORT. THE KIDS THE SAFE COSMETICS ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND CREATED THE CALIFORNIA SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO REPORT ANY COSMETIC OR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE STATE. THAT CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER OR BIRTH DEFECTS. THIS INCLUDES CHEMICALS FOUND ON THE PROP SIXTY FIVE LIST OR ON ANY OF THE LISTS CREATED BY SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITATIVE BODIES THAT INFORMED PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE. THE PROGRAM THEN MAKES THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATABASE WHICH IS UTILIZED BY CONSUMERS SALON WORKERS SCIENTISTS AND REGULATORS. FROM FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH A DOZEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THIS BILL WAS ENACTED THERE IS STILL NO MEANINGFUL REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF THE OVER TEN THOUSAND INGREDIENTS USED. TO FORMULATE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS EITHER HEARING CALIFORNIA. OR FEDERALLY. MOST PEOPLE ASSUME COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE TESTED FOR SAFETY BEFORE BEING STOPPED ON STORE SHELVES. IN TRUTH PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE ONE OF THE LEAST REGULATED. INDUSTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES THE FEDERAL FOOD DRUG AND COSMETICS ACT IS ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE PAGES LONG. AND HAS ONLY TWO PAGES DEVOTED TO COSMETICS SAFETY AND IS NOT BEEN AMENDED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE IT WAS ENACTED EIGHTY YEARS AGO. AS A RESULT A COSMETIC MANUFACTURE MAY USE ESSENTIALLY ANY RAW MATERIAL AS A COSMETIC INGREDIENT. AND MARKET THAT PRODUCT WITHOUT FTA PREMARKET TESTING REVIEW OR APPROVAL. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE ALTHOUGH THE FDA AND SEE PROHIBITS THE MARKETING OF ADULTERATED AND MISBRANDED COSMETICS IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THE FDA DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER RECALLS OF MISBRANDED OR ADULTERATED PRODUCTS TO GET THEM OFF OF STORE SHELVES. THAT IS WHY MANY COMPANIES CONTINUE TO TREAT THE ISSUE OF COSMETIC SAFETY AS IF IT'S THE WILD WEST. COMPANIES CAN AND DO USE CHEMICALS LINKED TO CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS REPRODUCTIVE HARM. INFERTILITY LEARNING DISABILITIES ON HORMONE DISRUPTION IN THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT WE USE EVERYDAY. WHICH IS WHY IN THE ABSENCE OF MEANINGFUL REGULATION OF THE OVER TEN THOUSAND INGREDIENTS USE TO FORMULATE THESE PRODUCTS. PROP SIXTY FIVE INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE PROVIDED BY THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. AS OF NOVEMBER SIXTH OUR STATE'S PUBLIC DATABASE DISCLOSED THE SALE OF OVER SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND COSMETIC PRODUCTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CONTAINING ONE OF EIGHTY EIGHT ONE OR MORE OF EIGHTY EIGHT UNIQUE PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS. THE PRODUCTS SPAN EIGHTY SIX CATEGORIES INCLUDING BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS MARKETED TO MEN. WOMEN CHILDREN TEENS AND SALON WORKERS SUGGESTING EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA USING BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS IS AT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO UNSAFE TOXIC CHEMICALS. GIVEN THE GROWING AWARENESS OF UNSAFE CHEMICALS AND COSMETICS IN THE GROWING DEMAND FOR SAFE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM IS MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER BECAUSE THE PUBLIC APPETITE FOR THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION GENERATED BY THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE. AS MORE AND MORE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE LINKS THE INCREASING RATES OF BREAST CANCER ASTHMA LEARNING DISABILITIES ANOTHER DISEASES AND CONDITIONS. TO THE AIR WE BREATHE THE FOOD WE EAT THE WATER WE DRINK AND THE. PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS CLEANING PRODUCTS AND OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE COME IN CONTACT WITH. ON A DAILY BASIS CONSUMERS ARE DESPERATE FOR INFORMATION TO AVOID UNNECESSARY EXPOSURES TO CHEMICALS LINKED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. YET SINCE ITS ENACTMENT STATE FUNDING FOR THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM. HAS DECREASED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM ITS INITIAL APPROPRIATION OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ITS CURRENT FUNDING LEVEL OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AS A RESULT OF CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING THE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES. TO ALLOW FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS STATUTORY MANDATES NOR TO ENSURE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROGRAM. DESPITE EXISTING ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WITHIN THE SHERMAN FOOD AND DRUG ACT. OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AND PROPOSE NEW FEE REVENUE TO BE GENERATED BY A MODEST FEE. LEVIED ON EACH PRODUCT REPORTED TO THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. PAID FOR ONLY BY THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING THE PRODUCTS WITH THE REPORTABLE CHEMICALS. IT WOULD PROVIDE A DEDICATED STREAM OF FUNDING TO THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM AND THIS FEE WOULD BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SERVICES. PROVIDED TO THE REPORTING COMPANY BY THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. AN INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM WOULD OUT FIVE POSITIONS TO THE TWO EXISTING PROGRAM STAFF. THE ADDITIONAL STAFF WOULD ENABLE THE PROGRAM TO CONDUCT REGULAR AUDITS OF THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF THE PROGRAM. THE DATA THAT'S REPORTED. INVESTIGATE INACCURATE AND UNDER REPORTING BY COMPANIES INVESTIGATE THE SAFETY OF INGREDIENTS AND PRODUCTS INCLUDING CALLING IN SAFETY DATA WHEN APPROPRIATE. CONDUCT PUBLIC EDUCATION ACTIVITIES TO RELATE TO REYES SALON WORKER AND CONSUMER AWARENESS AS WELL AS USE OF THE PROGRAM. INVESTIGATE THE INDUSTRY ABUSE OF TRADE SECRET DESIGNATIONS. INVESTIGATE UNSAFE SALON WORKER EXPOSURES FOR POSSIBLE REFERRAL TO CAL OSHA AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER RELEVANT STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. INCREASE FUNDING WOULD ALSO BE USED TO SUPPORT EVERY DESIGN AN OVERHAUL OF THE SAFE COSMETIC PROGRAMS OUTDATED ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION AND REPORTING SYSTEM. THINK I'M GONNA FINISH UP HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MORE AND MORE COSMETIC COMPANIES ARE MAKING BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WITH OUT PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS. JOINING A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR AND GROWING SECTOR OF THE EIGHTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR COSMETICS INDUSTRY PROVING THAT SAFE COSMETICS ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE THEIR PROFITABLE. IN CLOSING I HOPE THAT YOU AGREE THAT THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM IS A MUCH NEEDED MODEL FOR THE NATION THAT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED. AND ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED SO IT CAN MEET ITS FULL STATUTORY POTENTIAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE DR GINA SOLOMON TO MY RIGHT. WHO CAN HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROGRAM? AND ITS DIFFERENCE. WITH OTHER CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS SHE IS THOUGH RECENTLY. RETIRED DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SCIENCE AND HEALTH AT CAL EPA. SOLOMON IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR CHAIRMAN. I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AND I'M I'M JUST I CAME UP HERE UNDER UP MY OWN. VOLITION AND. MY OWN FUNDING I'M NOT A REPRESENTING ANYONE AND ACTUALLY I'M NOT REALLY SPEAKING. ON BEHALF FOR AGAINST THIS BUDGET ITEM BUT MORE HERE TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CAME UP. AND I THINK THAT MY EXPERIENCE WILL WILL HELP WITH ANSWERING THEM JUST SO YOU KNOW WHO I AM. UP UNTIL RECENTLY I WAS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR SCIENCE AND HEALTH. AT CAL EPA. IN THAT CAPACITY I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE SEA FOR A CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM ALSO IN PROP SIXTY FIVE. AND A NOW I AM A CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UCSF IN THE DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE. I'M ALSO A PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE IN OAKLAND. AND THESE PROGRAMS THE. IT SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM IN THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. DO YOU TOUCH BOTH ON AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS BUT IN VERY VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. SAVER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WAS CREATED ABOUT A DECADE AGO BY AT AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FUEHRER'S A BILL. AND. IT. GIVES THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL THE AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN CHEMICALS OF CONCERN. KNOWS PRODUCT TO USUALLY DEFINED QUITE NARROWLY. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO A ASKED TO. ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS THAT THEN REQUIRED THE MANUFACTURERS OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO CENTRALLY SHOW WHETHER THAT CHEMICAL IS REALLY NECESSARY IN THAT PRODUCT AND TO EVALUATE THE FULL SUITE OF ALTERNATIVES. AND THEN AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS A DTS HE DOES HAVE SOME AUTHORITY TO. MAKE REGULATORY DECISIONS. BUT THERE IS A AYE ABSENCE OF DATA COLIN AUTHORITY BUT IN THAT LAW. AND IT'S ACTUALLY AN ISSUE. THAT. DTS HE HAS ADDRESSED BY CALLING UPON. OTHER PROGRAMS OUT THERE WHERE INFORMATION ACTUALLY IS COLLECTED AND THEN MADE AVAILABLE I'M ONE OF THOSE BEING THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM WHERE IN THAT SPACE THERE IS ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION. COLLECTED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROGRAM ON CHEMICALS THAT ARE. ON THE DTS SEE CANDIDATE CHEMICALS LESS. SO THIS IS THIS IS A PLACE WHERE. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL UP ALONG WITH MANY CONSUMERS HOLES SO GO TO LOOK FOR FOR INFORMATION AND THEN. USE THAT INFORMATION TO TO TRY TO SET LOGICAL RATIONAL PRIORITIES FOR FOR. UNIT ISSUES THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU AT THAT TIME WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE ON BEHALF THE BLACK WHEN FOR WELLNESS THE CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS. I WILL SEE TO THE EXPERTS BEHIND ME BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BUDGET INCREASE ASK IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY NEEDED ON THIS MULTIBILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I UNANSWERED YOU'RE MY ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CAL PERGA AND THE. PRODUCTS CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. AS ORGANIZATIONS THAT CARE ABOUT CONSUMERS RIGHT NOW WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL. WITH THE MONEY IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE COMPLYING WITH THIS PROGRAM. AND THAT THE DATA IS. OF HIGH QUALITY SO THAT IT'S USABLE BY BOTH WORKERS AND CONSUMERS SO WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS CATHERINE PORTER ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH CALIFORNIA HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE. I'M ALSO HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF WOMEN'S VOICES FOR THE EARTH AND SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. WEARING MY COLLABORATIVE HOT. NAIL SALON WORKERS. ARE A GROUP OF WOMEN PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN A PREDOMINANTLY IMMIGRANT AND PREDOMINANTLY VIETNAMESE SPEAKING. THEY DESERVE AS DO OTHER SALON WORKERS WERE EXPOSED TO CHEMICALS ALL DAY THEY DESERVE THE MOST WROTE ROBUST INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM HAS DONE A GREAT JOB ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET FOR INSTANCE IT DEVELOPED A GREAT. DATABASE OF INFORMATION AND IT'S ACTUALLY DONE SOME A GOOD TRANSLATION OF MATERIALS INTO LANGUAGES SUCH AS VIETNAMESE BUT IT COULD DO AN EVEN MORE ROBUST JOB. AND EVEN DO A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS ARE FROM THE COSMIC FROM THAT CHEMICAL SOARING COSMETICS SO ALL THREE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WHOSE HOUSE I'M WEARING TODAY ALL. VIGOROUSLY SUPPORT MORE FUNDING FOR THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM THANK YOU. YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LEE SAID VAN FLEET AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE INVESTOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH NETWORK. WHICH IS A COLLABORATIVE PARCHIN PARTNERSHIP THAT ENGAGES WITH CORPORATIONS TO REDUCE FINANCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH RISKS. ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS. THE MEMBERS OF THE INVESTOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH NETWORK MANAGE OVER FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS. AND. THE NETWORK SUPPORTS THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT. DISCLOSURE INCENTIVIZE IS PERSONAL CARE AND COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS TO MOVE TO SAFER CHEMICALS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. THAT THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THIS STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL TOO FULL. TO ALLOW THE SAFER COSMETICS PROGRAM TO FULFILL ITS MANDATE UNDER THE MCNAUGHTON LAW THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO AGAIN I'M SUSAN LITTLE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AGAIN SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WE. WE HOPE WILL ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO FULLY ACTUALIZE ITS MISSION THANK YOU. YOU. MY NAME IS KATHERINE BEACH ON BEHALF OF BREAST CANCER ACTION AND KEEP ABREAST ORGANIZATIONS THAT CARE ABOUT VIA MENTAL CAUSES OF BREAST CANCER WE SUPPORT THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A GROWING. BODY OF EVIDENCE LINKING TOXIC CHEMICALS TO BREAST CANCER AND CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. ABOUT CHEMICALS IN OUR DAILY PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE. COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THIS PURPOSE. THANK YOU. I AM DOCTOR LISA BAILEY ON MY BREAST CANCER SURGEON AND. ALSO THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CANCER IN THE ENVIRONMENT TEAM FOR THE AMERICAN CANCER IDEA I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND. AND MY PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THERE WE SEE YOUNGER AND YOUNGER WOMEN A YOUNGER YOUNGER GIRLS MENSTRUATING AGE OF EIGHT EACH OF NINE. THIS IS NOT NORMAL OF SO MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS OCCURRING. SOME OF THESE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS TO CONTAIN. CHEMICALS THAT CAN CAUSE DISRUPTION OF THE HORMONE LEVELS AND WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THIS CAN BE RELATED TO SOME THESE HEALTH OF HEALTH EFFECTS. AS A PHYSICIAN WITH HIS WITH OUR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY DEVELOP BREAST CANCER WE CAN'T TELL THEM EXACTLY. HOW CAN THEY MAKE THEMSELVES HEALTHIER? TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF THEIR CANCER COULD RECUR. AND THERE DESPERATE TO KNOW WHAT ARE IN THOSE OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND OTHER. ANYTHING ELSE IN THEIR LIFE THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY REDUCE THEIR RISK FOR OF A FUTURE CANCER. OR OR ANYTHING. UP OF ON HEALTH SEAT A SIGNIFICANCE OF THEIR FAMILY SO I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS. ON BOTH ON MY STE BUT SELF HELP MYSELF AND ALL OF MY PATIENTS SICK. THANK YOU. I GET EXTRA CREDIT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL OVER IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT EMPOWER CONSUMERS FAMILIES AND WORKERS ABOUT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THEY USE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES SO THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED PURCHASING DECISIONS. AND UP PARTICULARLY THESE PRODUCTS CONTAIN CHEMICALS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS AND REPRODUCTIVE HARM SO WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT CONSUMER RIGHT TO KNOW PROGRAM THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MANY LIAM BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNSEL REPRESENTING OVER SIX HUNDRED. COMPANIES THAT EITHER MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR SUPPLY COSMETICS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE OPPOSE THIS BUDGET REQUEST THAT AUTHORIZES BROAD FEE AUTHORITY ON THE BACKS OF MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO FUND AN INEFFECTIVE. AND NOW DATA PROGRAM BY AN ALARMING FOREIGN TO PERCENT. CONSUMER SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY IS VERY STRONGLY COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE US. THE EARLIEST ASSERTION BY THE SPONSORS OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE LEAST REGULATED INDUSTRIES. I ONLY UNDERSCORES THEIR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING FOR WHAT THE COSMETIC INDUSTRY. HOUSE TO INDOOR FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE REGULATED BY ONLY HOW FOR PURPOSES OF PROP SIXTY FIVE REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC CONTROL SUBSTANCE CONTROLS. UNDER GREEN CHEMISTRY IN FACT ARE R. PRODUCTS WERE NAMED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. SCOPING SCOPING PLAN. IT ADDITIONALLY UNDER DP H. UNDER THIS EXISTING SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM CAR REGULATES US UNDER FOR THE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FOUND IN SOME FOR PRODUCTS. AS WELL AS FTA SO THAT ONLY SHOWS THE LAYERS AND LAYERS OF REGULATION THAT OUR INDUSTRY. AND PASSED TO COMPLY WITH. THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE FUNDING BY FOREIGN TO PERCENT UNDER THIS PROGRAM SERVICES SUSPEND. RESOURCES ON AN OUTDATED INEFFECTIVE AND DUPLICATIVE PROGRAM. AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT THIS REQUEST. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SEEKING AFFECTS. HOW DO OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS OVERLAP WITH AND POTENTIALLY DUPLICATE? AND WHY DO WE NEED TO MAKE THE SAFE CONSUMER SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM MORE ROBUST IN TODAY'S CONTEXT. THE Y. AGAIN AS SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE SEPARATE PRESENTATION IS REALLY CRITICAL AS WE CONSIDER FOREIGN TO PERCENT INCREASE. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF IT OUT DATED IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK ABOUT S. B. FORTY FOUR WHEN I WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. IT PREDATED A SIGNIFICANT UPSURGE IN PROP SIXTY FIVE ACTIONS THAT WE SEE TODAY IN MANY INDUSTRIES NOT JUST US. ADDITION. THERE WAS MENTION THAT LANDMARK LEGISLATION WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN ENACTING THE GREEN CHEMISTRY LAW. AND I ALREADY STATED MY EARLIER COMMENTS SAID THE IMPACT ON OUR PRODUCTS TODAY. BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK AT SB FORTY FOUR MAKE THEN. EVEN AND FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS UNDER LETTER I. IT TALKS ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVES TO SUBSTANCES THAT MAY BE HARMFUL. THAT'S PART AND PARCEL TO WHAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE IS ALL ABOUT. AND. UNDER THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS UNDER FOR EIGHTY FOUR LETTER F. IN G.. IT TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL RISKS TO SALON WORKERS. IT'S WORTH NOTING IN THIS CITING THAT PC PC ALONG WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTNERS WORKED WITH ASSEMBLYMAN KALRA WHO HAS. A BILL THIS YEAR AND HAD A BILL LAST YEAR THAT REQUIRES INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE FOR COSMETIC PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN A PROPOSED PROFESSIONAL SETTING. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INDUSTRY COMING TO THE TABLE. AND WORKING OUT A DEAL. ON INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE. AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING OUT A DEAL WITH MISTER KALRA THIS YEAR AS HE ADVANCES THAT EFFORT. LASTLY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE THE VALUE PROPOSITION AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT VALUE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET AS YOU GUYS ARE WELL AWARE. THIS DATABASE PROVIDES INFORMATION JUST FOR THE SAKE OF INFORMATION WITHOUT REAL CONTACTS FOR EXAMPLE. TITANIUM DIOXIDE IS AN INGREDIENT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED UNDER THIS PROGRAM. IT'S ALSO PROP SIXTY FIVE LISTED CHEMICAL. BUT IT'S ALSO FOUND IN OREOS IT'S A FOOD ADDITIVE. AND SO WITHOUT CONTEXT WHICH IS PROGRAM DOESN'T PROVIDE WERE ESSENTIALLY SAYING TO CONSUMERS IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO EAT THIS PRODUCT BUT NOT OKAY FOR YOU TO PLAY AT YOUR FACE. SARGIS CLOSE WITH URGING THAT COMMITTEE TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT THIS REQUEST. ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S CONTEXT. WITH THE LAYERS AND LAYERS OF OF EXISTING PROGRAMS BEFORE WE AUTHORIZED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THANK YOU. IF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR CHAIR. MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON WITH ARNOLD PORTER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT OPPOSITION TO THIS A BUDGET PROPOSAL ITEM IS NOT OPPOSITION TO DISCLOSURE IN FACT WE'VE SEEN. NOW LAST YEAR S. B. TWO FIFTY EIGHT DISCLOSURE. AND CLEANING PRODUCTS BY SENATOR LARA INDUSTRY IS COMING TO THE TABLE ON THESE ISSUES AS YOU ALSO HEARD IN THE CONTEXT OF PROFESSIONAL A SALONS. BUT I WANT TO. QUESTION WHETHER IN INCREASE AGAIN IN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT FUNDING AND IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATE. I WANTED ADDRESSED TO COMMENTS THEIR TWO ASSERTIONS RATHER THAT. THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY YOUR MATERIALS FOR THIS PROPOSAL. OUT ONE OF WHICH IS THE ASSERTION THAT THERE IS. MISS RECORD UNDER REPORTING AMONG COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS UNDER THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDING. TO SUPPORT. ENFORCEMENT. I I HAVE NOT YET HEARD OF ANY EXAMPLES OF SUCH UNDER REPORTING. OTHER THAN. THE BRAZILIAN BLOWOUT EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WHICH AGAIN IS INCLUDED IN THE MATERIALS. BUT TO THE EXTENT THERE IS SUCH UNDER REPORTING THERE ARE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS IN PLACE UNDER EXISTING LAW. THAT WOULD ALLOW NOT ONLY CONSUMERS. BUT BUSINESSES AGAINST BUSINESSES AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED. CHIU ALLEGE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES. AND MISLABELING WE SEE THESE CLAIMS BROUGHT. A VERY VERY FREQUENTLY IN FACT IT'S A TOPIC OF HOT DEBATE IN THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OF ITS BROAD APPLICABILITY. SO. THEY A PROGRAM DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. ENFORCING AT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE EFFECTIVE LOOK NO FURTHER THAN PROP SIXTY FIVE WHERE THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM HAS NO ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY UNDER THAT PROGRAM THERE'S A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. BUT EVEN WITHOUT ONE AGAIN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED. IS SOMETHING THAT. MANY ENTITIES USE. AND ALSO AS A SECOND ASSERTION THAT WAS MADE. IS THAT. BUSINESSES UNDER THIS ACT ARE ABUSING A TRADE SECRET CLAIMS. AGAIN THE MATERIALS DON'T CONTAIN ANY EXAMPLES. OF SUCH ABUSE. BUT. IT COULD NOT EXIST BECAUSE TRAITS OCCUR CLAIMS THAT ARE BEING CLAIMED UNDER THIS ACT ARE BEING DONE SO PURSUANT TO LAW. BOTH THE FEDERAL LAW AND ITS STATE COUNTERPART WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. PROTECT TRADE SECRET AND SO MANUFACTURES ARE DOING WHAT THEY ARE PERMITTED TO DO. AND PROTECTING TRADE SECRET FOR FOR FLAVORING AND FOR FRAGRANCES THOSE TWO ISSUES ARE SPELLED OUT AGAIN IN BOTH THE FEDERAL LAW AND THE STATE LAW. SO ANY ABUSE OF OF TRADE SECRET IS NOT ABUSE BUT SIMPLY COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. AND FINALLY. ASLEEP BEFORE ME TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT ARE THAT ARE IN PLACE YEAH ONE OVERLAPPING PROGRAM WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. IS PROP POSITION OF FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS ON THIS. DEVELOPMENT BUT. IN RESPONSE TO A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR PROP SIXTY FIVE WARNINGS BEING TO UBIQUITOUS IN. ARE NOT SPECIFYING ENOUGH INFORMATION THOSE WARNINGS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED BY THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE ON AUGUST THIRTIETH OF THE SHEER. AND THOSE WILL REQUIRE WARNING SUSPECTS OF BY THE CHEMICAL FOR WHICH THE WARNING IS BEING PROVIDED WHETHER FOR CARCINOGEN REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS. I'M OR BOTH. PROP SIXTY FIVE IS THE MOST FAR REACHING RIGHT TO KNOW ACT IN THE WORLD ARGUABLY AND EVEN THEN. IT PERTAINS TO EXPOSURES AT CERTAIN LEVELS AND NOT MERELY FOR THE CONTENTS. FOR BEING MERELY PRESENT IN IN IN THE UP PRODUCT. SO. WITH THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION AND. AGAIN CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO A NUMBER RUBIO TIM SHASTA CARE THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL I WILL ASSOCIATE MY A COMMENTS. WITH MISS LEE AND AND MISTER SAMPSON I THINK THE I WOULD CURSE A COMMITTEE TO LOOK CRITICALLY AT SOME OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED IN AND MISLEADING TESTIMONY ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF OTHER PROGRAMS REGULATORY. SCHEME SINCE HIS ACTION OF THIS LOSS OF PRODUCTION TO MAKE THE COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON A COOKING ON IS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL FRAGRANCE ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA AND THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. I COULD HELP MYSELF BUT JUST PUT ANOTHER LITTLE FINER POINT ON THE TRADE SECRET. AT CONCERNS THAT MR RAHMAN BROKEN BROUGHT UP. I JUST WANNA REMIND EVERYONE THAT IF YOU ARE ON THIS DATABASE SO OF THE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PRODUCT THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED SIX AS OF TODAY THAT HAVE A CLAIM OF TRADE SECRET. IF THEY HAVE CLAIMED IT ON THE DATABASE THEY'RE SAYING THERE IS A CARCINOGEN A REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS IN MY PRODUCT I'M JUST NOT TELLING YOU WHICH ONES I JUST DON'T WANT TO COME ACROSS THAT THEY'RE. SAYING HIDING EVERYTHING AND. YOU KNOW THERE IS USEFUL INFORMATION TO CONSUMER IN THAT RESPECT THAT IF THEY WANT TO AVOID ANY OF THOSE INGREDIENTS THEY CAN SEE. WHAT PRODUCT HIGHS SOMETHING AND? MEKA INFORMED DECISION TO THINK IT. GIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SHANE A BROWN OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MAKE COMMENTS BUT THOSE AHEAD OF ME WE ARE POSED THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND I THINK THAT WE AGREE THAT THE DATABASE IS OUTDATED AND I'M NOT FUNCTIONING BUT WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE PATHWAY PROPOSED MOVING FORWARD. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHTS A COUPLE OF OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE HAN. DTS SEE THESE ARE SORT OF BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SO WE JUST WANNA KIND OF PAINT THE PICTURE OF THE BROADER LEDGE. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT AND MANUFACTURERS ARE FACING. HUMAN. WHEN I BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FROM THE QUESTIONS. SO I WAS HOPING IF YOU COULD. BOTH DOCTORS OWN SOLOMON AND. JANET NUDELMAN. A PROBLEM MASSACRED THAT NOW IS PERFECT. CAN YOU COMMENT ABOUT GREEN CHEMISTRY WHICH CAME TO ORIGINATION AFTER THE. MEET IN LAW AND WHERE THERE'S OVERLAP DO YOU SEE THESE AS. COMPETING MEASURES OR COMPLEMENTARY. YESTERDAY NOT BROAD LEVEL AND THEN YOU COULD PIGGYBACK. SO. SO UNDER UNDER REALLY BROAD LEVEL WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS IS THESE TWO PROGRAMS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER BUT BUT NEITHER AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE OTHER. AND THEY ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT OUR RATE NOW THE THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM HAS AUTHORITY OVER. THE DISCLOSURE OF PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS SO THAT'S ONE LESS PLUS THE THE AUTHORITATIVE A LESS THAT INFORMED PROP SIXTY FIVE. THE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM AS LOOKING AT TWENTY FOUR DIFFERENT LISTS OF OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THEIR SCOPE WHEN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM EXAMINES THE THE SAFETY OF SPECIFIC CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS. THEY ARE LOOKING AT CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATIONS THAT USUALLY SPAN. LIKE IN MAYBE ONE OR TWO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY'VE ONLY SINCE THEIR INCEPTION THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. HAS A EXAMINED IN ISSUED REGULATIONS TO LOOK AT THREE DIFFERENT CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATIONS ONE LOOK DEBT TO FLAME RETARDANTS IN CHILDREN'S. SLEEPING PRODUCTS THE SECOND LOOK DAD MUFFLING CHLORIDE SO ONE CHEMICAL IN PETE STRIPPER AND THE THIRD LOOKED AT. ONE CHEMICAL UNREACTED MD AYE IN SPITE POLYURETHANE FOAM SO THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT THEY LOOK AT KIOSK A HANDFUL A HANDFUL AS MIGHT EVEN BE AN EXAGGERATION. OF CHEMICALS IN A SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR A FEW PRODUCTS IN A PRODUCT CATEGORY. THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM LOOKS AT. LOOKS FOR. APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED CHEMICALS IN THE FULL SUITE OF COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT EXIST ON THE MARKET TODAY. THEY ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE THE QUANTITY OF CHEMICALS THAT THEY LOOK AT AND THE PURPOSE BECAUSE. THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAMS PURPOSES DISCLOSURE OF THE INGREDIENT. AND THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM HAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ALTERNATIVES TO THE. TO THE CHEMICALS THAT THEY INVESTIGATE AND IF THEY DO FIND THEM TO BE HAZARDOUS WOULD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE A FOLLOW UP TO. TONY BENNETT. WOULD GREEN CHEMISTRY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS AND HOW DO WE AS CONSUMERS ENSURE THAT. WHAT WERE PUTTING ON OUR BODY IS SAFE TO USE? I'M. THE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY LAWS STADLER SH WHAT'S NOW CALLED THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AT DTS SEE. AND THAT PROGRAM HAS FROM ITS INCEPTION FACED A BIT OF A CATCH TWENTY TWO BECAUSE. THEY. NEED TO SURPASS A CERTAIN HURDLE IN ORDER TO MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR IDENTIFYING A PRIORITY. PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION TO REGULATE. AND THAT HURDLE INVOLVES YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT TOXICITY AND ALSO SOME. INFORMATION ABOUT EXPOSURE POTENTIAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT. DTS SEE QUICKLY REALIZED IN TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM. IS THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT CHEMICALS ARE IN A PRODUCT CATEGORY. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START. AND SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO. E. R. NOR TO FIGURE OUT A PATH FORWARD THEY HAVE TO FIRST FIGURE OUT OKAY WHAT. CHEMICALS WERE IN THIS PRODUCT CATEGORY THEN THEY LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE THAT. CONCENTRATION OF THOSE CHEMICALS AND. HOW COMMON THEY ARE AND HOW THAT PRODUCT IS USED IN WHAT THEY THERE'S LIKELY TO BE EXPOSURE TO? HUMANS EITHER DIRECTLY OR MAYBE INDIRECTLY THROUGH AYE GOING DOWN THE DRAIN IN INTO WATER SUPPLIES SO FORTH. SO THOSE. THEY THEY ALMOST CAN'T PASS. WITHOUT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S IN PRODUCTS AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SORT OF PIECES ARE OR PLACES THAT THAT WE GREEN CHEMISTRY. WE HAVE FOLKS ARE IMPLEMENTING GREEN CHEMISTRY GO TO STE FIND THAT IN STARTING PLACE. FUNDING CAME UP IN THE DISCUSSION AND I WAS HOPING YOU COULD. EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE NEED FOR FUNDING AND. I HAVE TO TELL YOU EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GET A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE IT DOES ALWAYS SEEM LIKE. WE SPEND. EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS. SO SOMEONE ONE THING THAT I FOUND VERY SURPRISING BY THE THE OPPOSITION'S TESTIMONY IS THAT MANY OF THEM WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE ON THE BUDGET AND THERE WOULD BE NO IMPACT ON THE BUDGET. AND I WANNA MAKE A REALLY CLEAR THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF PROPOSING A NEW FEE MECHANISM. THE THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE COMPANIES REPORTING THE PRODUCTS TO THE SAFE COSMETICS DATABASE. AT OF FAIRY VERY NOMINAL LEVELS ASSESSING A FEE OF THIRTY DOLLARS PER PRODUCT. THAT'S REPORTED TO THE DATABASE WOULD WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN AND THAT MY BELIEF ON ON ANY OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE REPORTING. OF THESE PRODUCTS SO SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THERE IS NO IMPACT ON THE BUT BUDGET AND THAT'S WHY WERE. WERE HERE TODAY. IN IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION IS WHAT WITH A FUNDING PAY FOR. EVEN OF THE THE PROBLEM WITH THE DATABASE AND AYE I HEAR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THAT IS SINCE AUGUST THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS INFORMED US THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED. JUST SINCE AUGUST THE LAST SIX MONTHS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED. USER ERROR SO THAT MEANS. BUT THREE HUNDRED TIMES WHEN WHEN A COMPANY WAS TRYING TO INPUT DATA INTO THE DATABASE. THEY RECEIVED AN ERROR AND THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THE INFORMATION IS NOT GETTING INTO THE DATABASE EN. A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT AND USABLE MANNER SO THE DATABASE IS MALFUNCTIONING I MEAN THAT IS JUST A REALITY. IT IT DOES NEED TO BE REPLACED AND AND THAT IS PART OF OUR OF OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT IT'S IT WOULD BE A ONE TIME FEE. TO CONDUCT A THE OVERHAUL OF THE DEBATE DATABASE ITSELF. ONE MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I WAS TO STOP ATTACKING ALSO A LOT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE FUNDING SOURCE AND. SOLD JUST TO UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY SO RIGHT NOW. I'M THE STATE IS FUNDING THE PROGRAM AND THAT YOUR PROPOSAL IS TO. INCREASE SAID BUT TO CHARGE THE COMPANIES FOR THAT FEE EXACTLY SO THE CURRENT OF THIS THE CURRENT ARM FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND IS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND WERE WE'RE PROPOSING TO TO SUPPLEMENT THAT FUNDING WITH. THE FEE. WHICH WOULD BE ASSESSED ON THE PRODUCTS REGISTERED WITH A DATABASE. AND THE FEE IS A ONE TIME FEE OR AN ONGOING FEE ON IT WOULD BE IT IT WOULD BE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT WOULD BE ASSESSED ON THE COMPANIES. BECAUSE THE THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO THE DATABASE CHANGE OVER TIME COMPANIES ARE CONSTANTLY FOR REFORMULATING. THEIR PRODUCTS SO I AS COMPANY I MIGHT BE REGISTERING A PRODUCT TODAY THAT CONTAINED STYRENE. AND PAY A THIRTY DOLLAR FEE NEXT YEAR I'VE MIGHT REFORMULATE STYRENE OUT OF THAT PRODUCT AND THEN I HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT. TO THE STATE SO IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT THAT THE ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE FEE OR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE FEE TAKE PLACE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. BY NOT GIVING TO TECHNICALITIES BUT WHAT IF A PRODUCT AS MULTIPLE TWO THE IS IT JUST ONE YEAH A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION THAT THE FEE WOULDN'T CHANGE BASED ON THE NUMBER. OF PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS IN THE PRODUCTS AND I COULD SHARE WITH YOU SOME SOME REALLY GOOD ILLUSTRATIONS OF PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS I MEAN ONE IN QUESTION HAS SEVEN. DFFERENT. CARCINOGENS REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS BUT THAT COMPANY WOULD JUST PAY THE THIRTY DOLLARS. ONCE FOR THAT PRODUCT MEANT JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. SO. WE DON'T THESE PRODUCTS AND RENO'S BECAUSE I LOOK AT LABELS ALL THE TIME. SO DON'T THESE PRODUCTS HAVE THAT ON THE LOWER THEIR LABELS THE INFORMATION ON THE LABELS. YES BEYOND FOOD DRUG AND COSMETIC SAFETY ACT AS BEEN AMENDED ONE SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO TO. TO MANDATE INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE ON THAT PRODUCT LABELS OF PERSONAL CARE AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS SO ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS IN A PRODUCT DO HAVE TO SHOW UP ON THE LABEL EXCEPT FOR. FRAGRANCE FLAVORINGS AND COLORANTS. SO YES CONSUMERS DO OF THE INFORMATION ON THE PRODUCT LABELS BUT I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU HAVE AS MUCH TROUBLE AS I DO WITH MY. MY OVER FORTY GUYS BUT I'M IT'S REALLY HARD TO READ THE LABELS IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND HER DISTINGUISH. BETWEEN THE CHEMICALS ON THE LABELS AND IT FEELS LIKE A A REALLY LOGICAL. AND UNFAIR FUNCTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PULL OUT THE CHEMICALS LINKED TO HARM. AND M. PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS DIRECTLY. WITHOUT DUB STAFFERS RECOMMENDED NO ACTION AT THIS TIME WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME GERMAN RAMBLER. ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO SPEAK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. I'M HERE REPRESENTING AMERICAN HEART AMERICAN CIRCUSES ZETIAN I'M CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE SACRAMENTO REGION. I'M ALSO A BOARD CERTIFIED NEUROLOGIST AND I PRACTICE HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY. I'D SPENT THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS OF MY CAREER SAID DEVELOPING CONFERENCE STROKES SYSTEMS OF CARE TELEMEDICINE SYSTEMS TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE IN THERE. MOST ACUTE IN EMERGING CRITICAL A TIME WHEN THEY'RE HAVING STROKES. I WANT TO SPEND THE NEXT TWO DECADES OF MY CAREER OF PREVENTING STROKE. AND IN ORDER TO PREVENT STROKE WE NEED TO MANAGE MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS. OF RISK FACTORS SUCH AS HYPERTENSION WHICH I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY. ATTENTION OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE WHICH IS PRESSURE THAT AFFECTS THE ARTERIAL WALLS OF OUR OF OUR VESSELS IN THE. CAN PUT US AT RISK FOR STROKE AND HEART DISEASE. WE WANT TO WITH OUR FUNDING REQUEST EMPOWER PEOPLE WITH KNOWLEDGE. PROVIDE THEM WITH THE UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE WHAT. CONSTITUTES HYPERTENSION. IN ORDER TO EMPOWER THEM WE NEED TO EDUCATE WE NEED TO CREATE AWARENESS. WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THEM TOOLS AND WE LIKE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH TOOLS SUCH AS MUCH MONITORING BLOOD PRESSURE CUFFS. WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM TO. PROVIDE SOME SELF CARE WILL ALSO ALLOW CARE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY TO GET OUT. AND TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE. SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE BETTER CARE OF THEMSELVES WE CAN PREVENT HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. I'M OPEN ANY QUESTIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILED INFORMATION HERE. AND. WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. I WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME. DOCTOR CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO TIM AND REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE AMERICAN CULTURE CARDIOLOGY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST ON THE HYPERTENSION PROGRAM. IN OVER THE YEARS AND REPRESENT CARDIOLOGY WHAT I'VE NOTICED. WHEN LISTENING TO THEM AND THEIR FRUSTRATIONS IS OVER PATIENTS GIVING ADVICE TO PATIENTS AND THEM NOT A SORRY FOLLOWING IT. AND IT'S THEY WALK OUT THE DOOR THEY TAKE INFORMATION BUT THEY DON'T ASSEMBLY DO ANYTHING WITH IT. I'M UNFORTUNATELY I'M IS THE DOCTRINE DESCRIBE WHEN COME STROKE PATIENTS FOR PATIENTS WHO SUFFER HEART ATTACKS THEY THEN COME TO US. AND THEY THEY HAVE A MUCH MORE SERIOUS CONVERSATION AMPLE WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW MANY TIMES THERE WERE FAR DOWN THE ROAD FROM HEART DISEASE PERSPECTIVE. WE CAN HELP THEM BUT IF THEY WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE ADVICE OR GIVEN EARLIER AND YOU MAY HAVE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE THE MERSEY DEPARTMENT AS WELL. ON THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT SO WE WILL LOOK AT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME SOME IS SHOWING SIGNS OF HYPERTENSION WE GIVEN SOME TOOLS TO MONITOR THAT. AND ONE OF THE ASPECTS THAT WE REALLY LIKED WAS THE NOTION OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS SO IT'S A REALLY KIND OF AN INTENSIVE WRAPAROUND APPROACH. TO STAY CONNECTED TO THE PATIENT. HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH TO STAY AHEAD OF THIS HYPERTENSION WHICH IT REALLY TRULY IS THE SILENT KILLER AS WE NOW. SO FOR THESE REASONS WERE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. I GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ADRIANA MORE I'M THE HEALTH POLICY AVERAGE CORONER FOR THE LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL AYE WE WORK WITH A LOT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS FROM WITHOUT US THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND A LOT OF WHAT WE HEAR IS THAT. A LOT OF THE MUSIC MEMBERS THAT THEY WORK WITH THEY HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS BUT THE LOT OF THEM DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE AND SO FOR US. OF YOU KNOW HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH HE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE FROM WITH BUT AS WE SEE THAT THEY ARE IN SCHICKEL PART OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE SUPPORT THIS AND WE HOPE THAT YOU DID. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. WITH THAT WILL BRING INTO DIES FOR ANY QUESTIONS. I WANTED TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THIS AND RECOGNIZE AS WELL WORKING IN THE ER THAT WE HAVE TO GET. UPSTREAM OF MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS. I WAS TROUBLED WHEN WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF LOOKING AT OUR DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS THAT OUR PATIENTS. DID NOT UNDERSTAND EIGHTY PERCENT OF WHAT WE TOLD THEM. AND KNOW THAT WE NEED BETTER OUR REACH BETTER EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE THIS CONTINUED DISCUSSION AND HOW IMPERATIVE IT IS FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AT THIS TIME STAFF RECOMMENDS NO ACTION WILL HOLD IT OPEN. AND THE BOND ISSUE ELEVEN THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR. AND THE MEMBER RUBIO. I'M MARK STAR IF YOU TOOK HER FROM ROMMEL HEALTHY PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WITH ME I HAVE MY ASSISTANT DEPUTY. MAN KLEIN. I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR PROGRAM. WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK CANNABIS UPDATE AND THEN WE HAVE ONE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU. SO THE CENTER FOR BERMAN HEALTH INCLUDES PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION. NO TO PREVENT DISEASE AND INJURY. SO ARE CENTER PROTECTION IMPROVES THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. BY WORKING TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THINGS LIKE FOODS. DRUGS MEDICAL DEVICES. MANUFACTURED CANNABIS PRODUCTS WHICH WE HEAR ABOUT MORE IN A MOMENT. WE ALSO CONDUCTED UNDER AGE TO BACK ON FORSMAN OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE STATE PROGRAM. WE DO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE. OVERSEEING MEDICAL WASTE GENERATION AND DISPOSAL. WELL I'LL ALSO NUCLEAR MERGER RESPONSE PROGRAM. OF THE. WORKING ON NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS TO REVERT INCIDENT. AND LASTLY WE OVERSEE THE USE OF RADIATION AND ONE OF OUR LARGER PROGRAMS RADIATION AND RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS IN A MEDICAL SETTING IS INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS AND RESEARCH. SETTINGS. WILL CERTIFY OPERATORS OF THAT OPERATE AT X. RAYS A CT SCANS AND OF THERAPEUTIC. RADIATION FOR. CANCER THERAPY AND OTHER USES. SO WE COVERS ALL THOSE THEIR INVESTIGATION INSPECTION LABORATORY TESTING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. MIRCHI RESPONSE AND OTHER REGULATORY ACTIVITIES WHO ARE MOSTLY A REGULATORY PROGRAM. THE CENTER INCLUDES THE DIVISION OF FOOD DRUG AND CANNABIS SAFETY AND INCLUDES A DIVISION OF RADIATION SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT. SO ARE MANUFACTURED CANNABIS SAFETY BRANCH HAS BEEN AMONG THE BUSIEST OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AS YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE. A SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE MEDICAL CANNABIS LAWS AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THEN THE ADULT USE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OF THIS ALL END UP REQUIRING LICENSING OF BOTH MEDICAL MEDICINAL CANNABIS IS NOW THE TERM WE USE. AN ADULT USE COMMERCIAL CANNABIS BY JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. RENT CLIMB WILL. STEP HAS STEPPED UP TO LEAVE THE CITY PAGES PART IN REGULATION. OF LIGHT SAME COMMERCIAL CANNABIS AND. WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE OTHER STATE ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT. SHOULD PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR WORK WHICH IS TO REGULATE CANNABIS MANUFACTURING. GOOD AFTERNOON. SO LET ME START BY JUST PROVIDING A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THIS THREE LICENSING DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING CANNABIS. SO WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL. IS THE LEAD AGENCY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CANNABIS PROGRAM. AND RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING DISTRIBUTORSTRANSPORTERS TESTING LABORATORIES MICRO BUSINESSES AND RETAILERS. THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CULTIVATORS. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANUFACTURER CAN OF A SAFETY BRANCH. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LACI'S LICENSING CANNABIS PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS. SO CITY P. H. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE OTHER TWO LICENSE IN THE PARLIAMENTS ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND DECEMBER. SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THE PERMANENT REGULATION RULE MAKING PROCESS WILL START IN THE SPRING OF THIS YEAR. THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY IN PARTNERSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH THE BUREAU AND WITH CITY CDFA. WE MEET REGULARLY AND TO COORDINATE ON REGULATIONS. AREAS OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH AND LICENSING. THE THE PERMITS STARTED ACCEPTING TEMPORARY LICENSE APPLICATIONS IN MID DECEMBER. AND CITY P. H. TO DATE HAS RECEIVED A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN APPLICATIONS. I CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS. WE HAVE ISSUED A FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN TEMPORARY LICENSE LICENSES. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE OF THE ORIGINAL APPLICATIONS WITHDREW THEIR APPLICATION. A HUNDRED AND SIX WHO WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. SO OUR CURRENT BACKLOG IS THIRTY SEVEN APPLICATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO IMPLEMENTED THE MANUFACTURING CANNABIS LICENSING SYSTEM. WHICH IS AN ONLINE APPLICATION PROCESSING SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM LAUNCH IN EARLY DECEMBER. AND THE SYSTEM ALLOWS LICENSEES TO SUMMIT MANUFACTURING LICENSE APPLICATION. CHECK THEIR LICENSE TAP OBLIGATIONS STATUS. MAKE PAYMENTS ONLINE AND RENEW THE APPLICATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT IS PARTNERING WITH THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL. TO COLLECT CASH PAYMENTS FOR LICENSING FEES. AT THE BR US SACRAMENTO LOCATION. IN ADDITION TO THAT ALL THREE DEPARTMENTS ARE COORDINATING. TO SET UP A CACHE LA CORP COORDINATED ON A CACHE LOCATION SITE FOR THE NORTH COAST. OVER THE LAST FOUR MONTHS WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN OUR RICH OFFENSE. AND DEVELOP A NUMBER OF RESOURCES TO ASSIST THE INDUSTRY AND THE TRANSITION TO THE REGULATED MARKET. SO THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED TEN LICENSE IN WORKSHOPS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE DURING THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. AND THIS WAS TO EDUCATE AND ADDRESS QUESTIONS FROM CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS. THE INFORMATION SHARE INCLUDED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND THE LICENSE APPLICATION PROCESS. IN TOTAL WE HAD ABOUT SIX HUNDRED ATTENDEES AT OUR SOCIAL. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE DEPARTMENT ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THREE WORKSHOPS HOSTED BY THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND FOR IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. ALL OF THE PRESENTATION MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN RESPONDING TO INQUIRE RESPOND INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC. AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE AVENUES FOR PEOPLE TO CONTACT US. WE HAVE A TOLL FREE NUMBER WE HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS. AND WILL ALSO HAVE AN ONLINE COMPLAINT FORM. OUR WEBSITE INCLUDES EXTENSIVE INFORMATION FOR THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC. SUCH AS THE REGULATORY INFORMATION. LICENSE INSTRUCTIONS A LICENSE LOOKUP TOOL ADVANCE RESOURCES AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. AND WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INCLUDING HANDOUTS WEBINARS IN MORE. TO ASSIST THE LICENSEES AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THEIR CATIA. AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO TRANSITION TO THE NEWLY REGULATED MARKET. PART OF THE REGULATORY PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. TO ENSURE PRODUCT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL CANNABIS MANUFACTURING. SO WE HAVE ESTABLISH FIVE REGIONAL DISTRICT OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHICH OR STAFF BY ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS WHICH HAVE BEGUN COORDINATED SITE FACILITIES OF OUR TEMPORARY LICENSEES. BUT THE FOCUS ON EDUCATING MANUFACTURERS ON HOW TO MEET THE STATE REQUIREMENTS. OUR COMPLIANCE TEAM IS COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. SO. WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY I KNOW IT'S QUITE A FULL LIST. OF ACTIVITIES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUB TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF ALL OF OUR ACCOMPLISHED. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MILIONI COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE ELEVEN. SEEING NONE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN. WE'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS. WITH THAT STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED NO ACTION WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE TWELVE. THANK YOU. OKAY ISSUE TWELVE IS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR A CALL PUBLIC BEACHES INSPECTION FOR CONTAMINANTS MRS OF FOLLOW UP. WORK. UNDER S. B. THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUESTS AN INCREASE OF THREE AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY TO ENABLE OUR DEPARTMENT TO FINALIZE THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE AMENDED PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL. AND WHICH IS REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF THE USE OF NEW RAPID TEST METHODS FOR BEACH WATER TESTING. YOU'RE DONE THE PACKET HAS AN EXCELLENT RIGHT UP OF THIS PROPOSAL SO I'LL JUST PROVIDE. LITTLE OVERVIEW LITTLE CONTEXT. A TO BE IN WITH A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR BEACH WATER SAFETY AND TESTING FOR CONTAMINATION. OF THE ONES THAT WOULD POST A BEACH WITH A WARNING SIGN IF NECESSARY OR EVEN CLOSE BEACH WHEN NECESSARY. OUR DEPARTMENT DETERMINES. THE TESTING METHODS AND THE STANDARDS AND THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE SAFETY OF BEACH WATER. AND WE DO THAT TO REGULATION. THE CURRENT GOLD STANDARD FOR DOCTOR LOGIC TESTING OF OF OCEAN WATER. IS CULTURE BASED AND THOSE YOU THAT OF BEEN INVOLVED MICROBIOLOGY PROBABLY KNOW THAT CULTURE REQUIRES TIME FOR THE ORGANISM TO GROW. THE AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIME FOR THAT TESTS IS ABOUT TWO DAYS. SO THAT HAS POTENTIAL HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES BY TAKING SO MUCH TIME THE WATER COULDBE CONTAMINATED FOR THOSE TWO DAYS BEFORE THE TEST COMES BACK AND PEOPLE ARE STILL SWIMMING AND IT. IS ALSO THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHEN THE BEACHES CLEAR AND ALLOWED TO REOPEN THERE'S A TWO DAY DELAY IN THAT AND THAT AFFECTS TOURISM AND OTHER ECONOMIC IMPACTS. SO THESE NEW RAPID METHODS HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE IN RECENT YEARS THEY'RE CALLED POLYMERIZED CHAIN REACTION METHODS AND. OF VERY QUICKLY. THEY ARE A METHOD TO DETECT THE DNA OF THE BACTERIAL ORGANISM AS OPPOSED TO CULTURING FOR ALIVE ORGANISM. THEY HAVE ABOUT A FOR OUR TURNAROUND TIME AND. SO BECAUSE OF THAT S. B. THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. CAME INTO LAW WHICH REQUIRES THE STATE TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE NEW TEST METHODS. FOR USE IN CALIFORNIA. THIRTY COMPLEX IT SPECIFIC TO EACH LOCATION EACH BEACH CAN HAVE DIFFERENT INTERFERING SUBSTANCE AS THE WATER. THERE'S A LOT OF SIDE BY SIDE TESTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO REPAIR TESTING STANDARDS GUIDELINES. AND CONDUCT TRAININGS AND REVISE OUR REGULATIONS. SO WE S. BEGAN WITH A BUDGET PROPOSAL THREE YEARS AGO THAT PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL LAB WORK AND ONLY LAB WORK. OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN COMPLETED DATA AS WELL DESCRIBE IN YOUR PACKET I WON'T REPEAT IT HERE WE'VE. BUT CLOBBERING QUITE CLOSE TO THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. THE KERN PROPOSAL THEN REQUESTS THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE LAB WORK AS WELL AS TO REVISE THE CURRENT RATE REVISE THE REGULATIONS. INCLUDES A LARGE COLLABORATIVE STUDY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RECALL THE FORTY SIX BEACH STUDY. THE SOME OF THE SITE SPECIFIC CRITERIA AND THERE'S ALSO A NEWER PC ARE AVAILABLE BUT WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS BUT I IT'S AN EVEN APPROVED RAPID TESTED WERE INCORPORATING IN OUR EVALUATION. AND THE BEGINNING IN THE THIRD YEAR WILL. BEGIN DRAFTING THE REGULATIONS WITH THE REVISED GUIDANCE FOR LOCALS AS WELL AS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM. AND WE EXPECT TO BE COMPLETELY DONE IN FIVE YEARS. OPEN QUESTIONS OF COURSE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA OPENING COMMENTS. WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE TWELVE AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS. HOME I WAS HOPING YOU CAN JUST MAKE IT A LITTLE REAL FOR ME I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS RECENTLY A SPELL IN MONTEREY. HOW WOULD THIS HAVE PLAYED OUT HOW WOULD THE PC ARE HAVE HELPED TO? IDENTIFY THE ORGANISM EARLIER OR OPEN UP THE BEACH SOONER CAN YOU GIVE US THAT AS A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE. WELL SO I DON'T RECALL THIS BILL MONTEREY BUT IF THERE'S A FACE FOR EXAMPLE SEWAGE OUTFLOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. TYPICALLY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WILL CLOSE THE BEACH IMMEDIATELY BASED ON THAT KNOWLEDGE OF SEWAGE OUTFLOW BECAUSE OF THE KNOWN RISK HAZARD OF THAT. AND THERE'S A FLOOD FOR EXAMPLE IN A SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT CAN OVERFLOW. BUT THESE ARE MORE ACTUALLY TESTS ARE MORE VALUABLE IN SITUATIONS WE DON'T HAVE A KNOWN HAZARD LIKE THAT. AND SO IT MAY BE. HEAVY USE OF THE BEACH AND MAYBE SOMETHING RELATED TO A SUITABLE THAT'S THAT'S NOT KNOWN OR OTHER CAUSES OF SOME KIND OF CONTAMINATION. BUT THE ADVANTAGE OF THE RAPID TEST IS REALLY THAT ONCE WE HAVE ALL THESE METHODS IN PLACE AND HAVE VALIDATED AT EVERY AT VARIOUS SPEECH LOCATIONS. WE'LL HAVE RESULTS A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FIVE RESULTS OF FROM THEIR BEACH WATER SAMPLES WITHIN FOUR HOURS AS OPPOSED TO TWO DAYS AND SO THEY CAN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ON ADVISING THE PUBLIC ARE CLOSING THE BEACH OR WHATEVER BASED ON THAT. WITHOUT STAFFERS RECOMMENDED NO ACTION ON THIS ITEM WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWELVE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTEEN DIDN'T GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE I'M JEANNE I SEE NO I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF BOTH HELP. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY CJ HOWARD WHO IS OUR CHIEF OF POLICY AND PLANNING IN THE CENTER. AND OUR ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR SCOTT THE PHONO. I'M GONNA START OUT WITH. PROVIDING THE REQUESTED OVERVIEW OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER FOR HEALTHCARE QUALITY LICENSING CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF LICENSED HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. TO ENSURE SAFE EFFECTIVE AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE FULFILL THIS ROLE BY CONDUCTING PERIODIC INSPECTIONS AND COMPLAIN INVESTIGATIONS OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. CH C. Q. LICENSES AND CERTIFIES OVER TEN THOUSAND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. IN THIRTY DIFFERENT LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION CATEGORIES. WE OVERSEE THE CERTIFICATION OF NURSE ASSISTANTS HOME HEALTH AIDES HEMODIALYSIS TECHNICIANS AND THE LICENSING OF NURSING HOME ADMINISTRATORS. IN ADDITION TO THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE WITHIN THE CENTER OF THE HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS PROGRAM. S. PROGRAM WAS CREATED WITH A MANDATE TO OVERSEE THE PREVENTION SURVEILLANCE AND REPORTING OF HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS. HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS ARE THE MOST COMMON COMPLICATION OF HOSPITAL CARE. SINCE TWENTY TEN ARE HAI PROGRAM HAS REDUCED ANNUAL PUBLIC REPORTS OF HOSPITAL. HA A DATA. TO HELP INFORM THE CONSTITUENCIES OF HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS AMP PROMPT PROVIDERS TO TAKE ACTIONS TO PREVENT INFECTIONS. WE ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN HA I PREVENTION BY PERFORMING SITE VISITS TO HOSPITALS WITH HIGH INFECTION RATES. CONVENING REGIONAL HAI PREVENTION COLLABORATIVE'S AND PROVIDING INFECTION PREVENTION EDUCATION TO PROVIDERS. ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CENTER FUNDED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FUND. FEDERAL FUNDS. REIMBURSEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTER AGENCY AGREEMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT OUR ACTIVITIES IN STATE OWNED FACILITIES. THERE WAS A REQUEST IN THE RIGHT UP TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE OVER THE YEARS. THE COMMITTEE RIDER PREFERENCES A TWENTY TWELVE LETTER FROM THE CENTER FROM CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. STATING THAT THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY NEEDED TO IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCES. WE ARE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE MADE CONTINUOUS AND STEADY PROGRESS. IN COMPLYING WITH CMS REGULATIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY MET ONLY FOUR OF SEVENTEEN CMS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE MET FIFTEEN OF EIGHTEEN SEE UP CMS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THE COMMITTEE RIGHT UP ALSO REFERENCES THE HARPER REPORT THAT WE COMMISSIONED AS A RESULT OF THE LETTER FROM CMS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING STEADILY. SINCE THE REPORT WAS ISSUED TO IMPLEMENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS PURSUANT TO THE HARPER REPORT INCLUDE. A COMPLETE REVAMP OF OUR WORK FORCE ESTIMATE TOOL TO MORE ACCURATELY PROJECT THE NUMBER OF STAFF WE NEED TO COMPLETE OUR MANDATED WORKLOAD. IMPROVES TRANSPARENCY BY WAY OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. PUBLICATION OF DATA METRICS. AND A REVAMP OF OUR WEB PAGE DISPLAYING FACILITY INFORMATION. WE ARE EMBRACING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS BY USING NON REGISTERED NURSES TO COMPLETE OUR MEDICAL BREACH INVESTIGATIONS. THUS FREEING UP ARE REGISTERED NURSE WORKFORCE TO FOCUS DIRECTLY ON THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE THEIR EXPERTISE. WE'RE MAKING GREATER USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE REAL TIME TRAINING TO OUR WORKFORCE AND EXPLORING WAYS TO USE MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES. TO SUPPORT THE CONSISTENT TIMELY INVESTIGATION OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. WE HAVE PROVIDED TABLETS TO OLIVER SURVEYOR WORKFORCE. TO ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK. AND WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HIRING REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES US TO HIRE A NEW NURSE BY OVER THIRTY TWO PERCENT. WE HAVE A ROOM ROBUST RECRUITMENT RETENTION PLAN AND OUR CURRENT HEALTH FACILITIES EVALUATOR NURSE VACANCY RATE IS APPROXIMATELY TEN PERCENT. IN ADDITION WE ARE ROLLING OUT LEADERSHIP IN STAFF DEVELOPMENT TRAINING TORRENT TIRE WORKFORCE. ALONG THE WAY WE HAVE ENGAGED IN NUMEROUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. INCLUDING REVAMPING OUR APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS IN ISSUING CITATIONS. THESE EFFORTS ARE PAYING OFF AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF NEW COMPLAIN INVESTIGATIONS THE CITATIONS. SURVEYORS ARE COMPLETING MORE TIMELY. WE'VE ALSO COMPLETED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS UNIT. AND AND OUR INVESTIGATION SECTION WITHIN THE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION BRANCH. WITH THE ADDED RESOURCES THAT WE. RECEIVED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FOR PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION BRANCH THE BRANCHES SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED ITS LARGE BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST CERTIFIED INDIVIDUALS. AND INVESTIGATES MOST NEW COMPLAINTS WITHIN NINETY DAYS. THE HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATE INFECTION PROGRAM HAS REFORMATTED ITS SURVEILLANCE DATA IT IS PARTNERING NOW WITH LICENSING CERTIFICATION STAFF. TO USE THEIR DATA TO HELP US IDENTIFY HOSPITALS WITH PERSISTENTLY HIGH HAI INFECTION RATES. AND TO PRIORITIZE THOSE FACILITIES FOR RELICENSING SURVEYS WITH A FOCUS ON INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT CALIFORNIA RANKED HIGHEST IN THE NATION IN THE USE OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE WERE THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. SIMILARLY IN TWENTY TWELVE CALIFORNIA RANKED TWENTY FOURTH IN THE NATION. IN THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF HANNAH PSYCHOTICS TODAY WE RANK FOURTH LOWEST IN THE NATION. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE ONGOING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MATH. EFFORTS WITHIN OUR CENTER. YOU TURN IT OVER TO SEE JAY HOW'RE NOW TO TALK ABOUT OUR BUDGET. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON UP FOR THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR POINT TWO MILLION. CVC HERE PROJECTS ARE REVISED FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION OR THREE POINT TWO PERCENT COMPARED WITH BUDGET ACT. THIS INCREASE IS THE RESULT OF VARIOUS BASELINE ADJUSTMENTS. FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SEAT SECURE ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES WILL TOTAL TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF THIRTEEN POINT SIX MILLION. OR FIVE POINT TWO PERCENT COMPARED WITH THE BUDGET ACT THIS INCREASE INCLUDES ELEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN VARIOUS BASELINE ADJUSTMENTS AND ONE POINT NINE MILLION FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FUND. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SEE THE PEACHES CONTRACT WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND WILL HAVE. LONGER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. THIS PROPOSAL EXTEND THE CURRENT CONTRACT BY ONE YEAR AND UPDATE THE SALARIES INDIRECT COSTS THREE AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS RATE. THE ESTIMATE SHOWS THAT SEE PETE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN HAPPENS. THOSE WITH HFE AND HEALTH FACILITY EVALUATOR NURSES. WHAT WHICH SHOULD THIRTY THREE OF THEM WOULD BE FOR THE STATE WORK AND A HUNDRED FOURTEEN TO BE IN LA COUNTY? WHILE CCQ CONTINUES TO HAVE A HIGH VACANCY RATE IS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN FILLING EXISTING VACANCIES AS OF JANUARY TWENTY IN THE OVERALL VACANCY RATE IS APPROXIMATELY TEN PERCENT. FOR THE HEALTH FACILITY EVALUATOR NURSES SUITS ACCUSE WORKING WITH RECRUITMENT CONSULTANTS TO AGGRESSIVELY RECRUIT AND FILL THESE POSITIONS. AND AS DECREASE THE VACANCY RATE BY EIGHT PERCENT SINCE THE SUMMER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FOR THESE REASONS TO SECURE IS NOT REQUESTING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AT THIS TIME. THE LA COUNTY. BUDGET REQUESTS A SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET REQUEST IS ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THERE FROM OUR PROGRAM FUND. THEY INCREASE AUGMENT DISCUSSION ON THE COUNTY UNTIL ISSUE FOURTEEN IF THAT'S THAT'S I JUST. COME. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON ISSUE THIRTEEN AT THIS TIME. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA JOH NA COMMENT. WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THIRTEEN AT THIS TIME. THE DOCTOR CHAIR THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TODAY MY NAME IS CAROL HERMAN I'M THE PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER. OF THE FOUNDATION AID THE ELDERLY. WE WORK ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS NOW ON THE PREVENTION OF ELDER ABUSE SPECIFICALLY IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES IN ACUTE HOSPITALS. OVER THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE HELPED OVER SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES THE MAJORITY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WERE HEADQUARTERED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WE A FILE OF THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST NURSING HOMES FOR THEIR POOR CARE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. RIGHT. MOST OF OUR CLIENTS SUFFER FROM POOR KIERAN NEGLECTING CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES. WHO COMPLAINS THAT WE FILE ALWAYS INCLUDE INSUFFICIENT STAFFING? FAYE ALSO FILED THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAWSUIT IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE NURSING HOME ABUSE CASES IN A TIMELY FASHION. THAT INSTIGATED THE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT THAT SHOWED ELEVEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS THAT HAD BEEN SITTING STAGNANT IN THE DEPARTMENT FOR QUITE SOMETIME. INSUFFICIENT STAFFING IS A YOU KNOW I MIGHT BE JUMPING AHEAD ON THIS MAYBE I SHOULD COME LAST THE NEXT ONE JUST SESSION. BUT. AS I SAID THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMPLAINTS INCLUDE INSUFFICIENT STAFFING. WHEN THE FACILITIES UNDERSTAFFED. THE PATIENT'S NEEDS CANNOT BE MET SO IT'S AUTOMATIC NEGLECT. INCREASED STAFFING IS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS AND IS ABSOLUTE MESSES IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NECESSARY. THAT INCREASED STAFFING UNDER THIS BILL. GOES FORWARD. WHAT SUPPORT WHAT FATE SUPPORTS IZZIE INCREASE IN THE NURSING HOWARD HOURS WE DON'T SUPPORT IS THE WAIVER THAT ALLOWS FACILITIES NOT TO ADHERE TO THE INCREASE NURSING? THE WAIVER WOULD BE TO DO YOU BEND DE WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE PATIENTS AS IT COULD ALLOW A FACILITY. TO BE UNDERSTAFFED. AGAINST STATUTE. FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY OF NOT STOPPING. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENT. DPH HAS NO PLANS ON WHAT TO DO WHEN A FACILITY CONTINUES TO BE UNDERSTAFFED. THE WORK FORCE IS DEFICIENT. AND THE WORKFORCE IS DEFICIENT THEY'RE STATING THAT THE WORKFORCE IS DEFICIENT AND THEREFORE THEY CAN'T HIRE. SO THEY'RE ALLOWING WAIVERS TO FACILITIES THAT CAN PROVE THAT THEY CAN'T HIRE ENOUGH YET THE DEPARTMENT HAS FUNDS AVAILABLE TO HELP THE FACILITIES TO HIRE PEOPLE. JUST LAST WEEK THE INDUSTRY STATED. THAT REGULATIONS HAVE BECOME AFFECTED SO. JULY FIRST OF EIGHTEEN. HAVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN HUNDRED NURSING HOMES IN CALIFORNIA SIX HUNDRED WILL BE FILING FOR WAIVERS. THAT SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO MEET THE NEW STAFFING REGULATIONS. I THINK THAT'S ABDOMINAL HIDE THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE IT'S NOT THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND CERTAINLY IS. PUTTING THE NURSING HOME PATIENTS AT GREAT RISK FOR POOR CARE AND A GLASS. IT APPEARS THAT. DE IT. ALSO IN THIS THE PAPERS HERE SAYS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS. UMPIRE ASKING TO POSTPONE ALL IS THE STAKEHOLDERS I CONSIDER TO BE NOT THE INDUSTRY. THE INDUSTRY WANTS IS TO BE POSTPONED NOT THE STAKEHOLDERS. SO IT APPEARS THAT DPH HAS IGNORED OUR REQUEST AS A STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE FAMILIES IN THE STATE. THAT WAIVERS NOT BE ALLOWED. IN THE WAIVERS THAT THEY HAVE COME UP WITH. NOT BE IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE IT LEAVES A AND A WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY WE'RE ALL SHOCKED. THIS IS JUST LAST THURSDAY THAT SIX HUNDRED FACILITIES WILL BE APPLYING FOR WAIVERS NOT JUST NOT TO STAFF TO THE NEW REGULATIONS. SO I'M ASKING THAT THE COMMITTEE RELOOK AT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS AND IT'S IT'S NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN RISEN A SUBCOMMITTEE MARKETS MCKINNEY LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. SEEN A HAS TAKEN PART IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT REGARDING LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL S. B.. NINETY SEVEN THAT INCREASED THE REQUIRED STAFFING RATIOS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WE SHARE A NUMBER OF THE CONCERNS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED BY MS HERMAN WITH THE FOUNDATION AIDING THE ELDERLY ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S DRAFT WORKFORCE SHORTAGE WAIVER. IN ADDITION WE WANT TO POINT OUT ON THAT THE PREVIOUS JEFF OF THE WAIVER REQUIRED. THAT BASICALLY INCLUDED CRITICAL PATIENT PROTECTIONS THAT SEEING A BELIEVES TO BE IMPORTANT TO SAFEGUARDING PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT HAVE PROPOSED REQUIRING THAT FACILITIES ALSO INCLUDE A PATIENT ASSESSMENT FOR EACH RESIDENT ALONG WITH THE FACILITIES PLAN. TO ADDRESS RESIDENT NEEDS AND ASSURE QUALITY CARE. DESPITE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE SO SEEING A STRONGLY SUPPORTED THIS PROVISION WE WROTE THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATING OUR SUPPORT. HOWEVER AND I JANUARY MEETINGS WE HEARD FROMINDUSTRY. THAT UNFORTUNATELY THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONDUCT PATIENT ASSESSMENTS FOR EACH PERSON IN THE FACILITY. THIS IS TROUBLESOME TO US BECAUSE EXISTING LAW ESSENTIALLY ARE READY REQUIRES THAT THESE PATIENT ASSESSMENTS BE COMPLETED FOR EVERY PATIENT UPON A MISSION. AND UPDATED QUARTERLY AND MORE OFTEN IF THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE PATIENT'S CONDITION. ARM AND HONESTLY THE INDUSTRY'S ASSERTION THAT IT CANNOT CONDUCT PATIENT ASSESSMENTS FOR EVERY PATIENT IN THE FACILITY. IS A FRIGHTENING ADMISSION OF INADEQUACIES IF THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING MET. SEEN A BELIEVES THAT A FACILITY REQUESTING A WAIVER OF THE MINIMUM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL SHOULD INCLUDE A PATIENT ASSESSMENT FOR EACH RESIDENT. AND THE PLANT TO ADDRESS RESIDENT NEEDS. THIS IS ALREADY A REQUIREMENT FOR HE'S PACING AND DESCRIBING HOW THESE NEEDS WILL BE MET WITH STAFFING UNDER THE REQUEST A WAIVER SHOULD NOT IMPOSE AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON ANY FACILITY. YET THE DEPARTMENT'S MOST RECENT DRAFT DELETED THIS REQUIREMENT SO CNA OBJECTS THESE CHANGES DUE TO THE FACT THAT ITS EXISTING LAW. AND WE FEEL AS THOUGH FACILITY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN MEET THE PATIENTS ON NEEDS DESPITE A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE SO WE APPRECIATE YOU GUYS CONSIDER OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU SIR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. TODAY I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE LICENSING FEES AND THE CENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS UNIT. ON WE ARE VERY CONCERNED OVER THE CD PAGE PROPOSAL TO RAISE HOSPITAL'S PEACE ONCE AGAIN. CA CHAN ARE MEMBER HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO BE PROSTRATA BY THE LENGTHY DELAYS IN CTP H. LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION COMPLETION OF COMPLAINT. AND AND EDDIE REPORTED EVENTS SURVEYS AND WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CENTRALIZED APPLICATION UNITS ABILITY TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER. CDP AGE PROPOSES TO RAISE HOSPITAL PIECE BY FIVE PERCENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. HOSPITAL FEES HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS. IN IN THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN YEAR THEY WERE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX DOLLARS PER BETH. THEY ARE PROPOSED TO BE RAISED TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE LONG WAIT TIMES PROCEED TO BE CAGED TO COMPLETE AND APPROVED APPLICATIONS. THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE CENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS UNIT. THIS CA YOU PROCESSES APPLICATIONS FOR MANY CHANGES INCLUDING INITIAL APPLICATION PER LICENSURE. CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP CHANGE OF LOCATION CHANGE OF NAME CHANGE OF SERVICES. CURRENTLY IT TAKES APPROXIMATELY EIGHT TO TEN MONTHS FOR AN APPLICATION TO REACH THE TOP OF THE QUEUE. TO BE ASSIGNED TO IS CA YOU ANALYST. IT TAKES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE TO RECEIVE APPROVAL FOR THE NEW OR EXPANDED SERVICES. TWO EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF SERVICES WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR ONE HOSPITAL EXPERIENCED A SIX MONTH WAIT FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW MRI. IN THE MEANTIME PATIENTS HAD TO BE TRANSPORTED TO ANOTHER LOCATION IN AN AMBULANCE FOR THEIR MRO. ANOTHER HOSPITAL REPORTED THAT IT HAD TO WAIT NINE MONTHS BECAUSE IT WAS ADDING TWO BEDS TO AN EXISTING CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROGRAM. IN A SOME LIKEWISE PATIENTS NEEDED BE TRANSPORT BY AMBULANCE TO ANOTHER FACILITY THAT HAD AN OPEN CARDIAC CATH THE. SO THESE ARE REAL THESE ARE SERVICES THAT REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO PATIENTS. WE DO NO THAT CD PAGE HAS UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE THE CA USE EFFICIENCY RECRUITING HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF. BOTH TEMPORARY STAFF AND TEMPORARY. BUT DELAYS DO CONTINUE. WE WOULD LIKE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER MANDATING PUBLIC METRICS ON THE WORKLOAD AND TIMELINESS OF THE CA USE ACROSSALL FACILITY TYPES. IN INVOLVING ALL APPLICATIONS. THANK YOU. JENNIFER SIDE ARAMBULA AFTER THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES I'D LIKE TO REFLECT ON THE COMMENTS THAT BARBARA GLAZIER JUST SAID WITH THAT COMPANY HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WITH. RESPECT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT DELAYS WITH THEM RESPONSES TO A SURVEYS AND OTHER THINGS WITH RESPECT TO NURSING FACILITIES I LIKE TO USE MY TIME JUST HAVE A COMMENT ON THE. A CONTENT IN THE. I CAN THEN THE ANALYSIS AND ALSO. RELATED TO ISSUE THIRTEEN THAT DEALS WITH THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THE NEW STAFFING MANDATES THAT WILL BE IN PLACE. AND AS OF JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. I'M AS FOLKS NO ONE IS REFLECTED IN THAT. INDIAN. COMMITTEE. ANALYSIS THERE IS SOME. STRONG CONCERNS AT LEAST BY. THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THAT. REQUIREMENT IT'S GOING TO BE IN PLACE AS OF JULY FIRST AND WE DO KNOW THAT LAST YEAR WAS AND PUT IN PLACE AT THE END OF THE. BUDGET PROCESS ON THERE HAS BEEN A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME FOR FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE NECESSARY STAFF. AND IS A SUBCOMMITTEE KNOWS WE TESTIFIED LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT WITH RESPECT TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR OUR FACILITIES TO FIND THE WORK FORCE NECESSARY TO STAFF THEIR FACILITIES. AT THE LEVEL THAT WAS REQUIRED PRIOR TO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE FACILITIES THAT ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COMPLY WHEN WE. PROVIDED TESTIMONY OR PROVIDED. OF. COMMENTS AT THE UPCOMING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS OF WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH THE WAIVER PROCESS WE DID SAY THAT WE. WE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE AT MOST US SIX HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT AT LEAST NOW ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE THAT ARE GOING TO THREE MONTHS AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THIS MANDATE. I THINK EVERY FACILITY THAT I KNOW OF EVERY FACILITY WITHIN OUR MEMBERSHIP WHICH IS EIGHT HUNDRED FACILITIES MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED FACILITIES WANT TO COMPLY WITH THIS NEW REQUIREMENT. AND THEY WANT TO BE ABILITY TO HIRE NEW STAFF THEY CANNOT FIND THEM. WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE A MANDATE THAT'S NOT BEING SUPPORTED BY THE STATE TO HELP THOSE FACILITIES FIND THAT WORK FORCE? THEM BACK WHEN WE HAD IT A STAFFING MANDY PUT IN PLACE BACK IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THERE WAS A PHASE IN APPROACH FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE HAD THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE TIME TO ACTUALLY. COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE THERE IS A CARE GATOR INITIATIVE THIS ACTUALLY PUT PLACE THAT SAME TIME AND THE GOVERNOR PUT IN TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PUT MONEY INTO. CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT TRAINING PROGRAMS NURSING AND OTHER TYPES OF AB TRAINING PROGRAMS WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOW AND WE HAVE A MANDATE WITHOUT ANY STATE SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT FACILITIES CAN STAFF UP TO BE COMPLIANT. THERE IS A WAIVER PROCESS IT'S BEING DELIBERATED RIGHT NOW IS CDP H.. WE HAVE APPRECIATED THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR FACILITIES TO FIND A WAIVER THIS WAIVER IS MEANT TO BE TEMPORARY. IT'S MEANT TO LAST FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO FACILITIES CAN BECOME COMPLIANT. OUR CONCERN IS THE WAIVER PROCESS SAYS IS WORKING IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR ALL FACILITIES TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR A WAIVER. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FACILITIES HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY WE WOULD RATHER ACTUALLY SEE THE STATE ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF PHASE IN APPROACH. FOR FACILITIES TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMPLY. LIKE WE DID BACK IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. I'M AND WITHIN THAT PERIOD OF TIME THE ONE TO TWO YEARS THAT THEY CAN GET TO COMPLIANCE THEN WE DON'T HAVE THE DEPARTMENT HAVING TO DEAL WITH SIX HUNDRED APPLICATIONS. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FOUND THE ABILITY TO HAVE THEM APPROVED BY JULY FIRST. AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE ONLY HAVE FORTY FACILITIES IN THE STATE THAT HAVE TRAINING PROGRAMS. CPA'S IS TAKING SOME HOURS UP TO NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS TO ACTUALLY APPROVED. TRAINING PROGRAM CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS TO GET STARTED WE HAVE DELAYS ON C. N. A.'S HUMAN BEING CERTIFIED. WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT FACILITIES HAVE THE SUPPORT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. WE WANT AND WE APPRECIATE THIS NEW REQUIREMENT WE WANT TO COMPLY WITH IT WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO ACTUALLY. CHANGE THAT NEW REQUIREMENT ANYWAY BUT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE OUR FACILITIES THE ABILITY TO TO BE COMPLIANT. THANK YOU MA'AM. MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST OF ANYWAY NOW BEHALF OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION I'M WE THINK YOU GUYS FOR THE PROCESS LAST YEAR AND AND AND. PASSING S. B. NINETY SEVEN WE HAVE A BIT OF CONCERNS THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WILL HOWEVER WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR ALL OF THOSE. WHO HAVE INPUT TO BE INVOLVED INDUSTRY LABOR ADVOCATES CONSUMERS? BUT WE DEFINITELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE GONNA ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT HENCE THE WORKFORCE I'M SHORTAGE WAIVER WE THINK THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS THE PERFECT. PLACE FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS THEY ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WE ARE BETTER ALARMED ABOUT THE PATIENT ACUITY WAIVER THAT HAS JUST BEEN RECENTLY. BROUGHT UP WITHIN THE LAST MONTH WE CAN WE COMPLETELY THINK THAT UNDERMINES THE ENTIRE INTENT. OF S. B. NINETY SEVEN WHICH YOU GUYS NOTICE. FOR PASSING LAST YEAR THE WHOLE POINT OF S. B. NINETY SEVEN IT'S PROVIDE QUALITY CARE QUALITY STAFF INTO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN NURSING FACILITIES AND AB PATIENT ACUITY WAIVER DOES DEFINITELY UNDERMINES THAT. WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. LAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT WAIVERS IN PLACE FOR THOSE FACILITIES. BUT AGAIN IT IT SHOULD BE WORKED OUT THROUGH THE PROCESS IT AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH SEE AN AIDS IN ORDER TO FULFILL THOSE THERE WAS MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR TRAINING I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT RECRUITMENT. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO PUT IN THOSE SLOTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TRAINING THAT THE BUDGET. HAS APPROPRIATED FUNDING FOR WE ARE DEFINITELY COMMITTED THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDERS WE'RE VERY HARD VERY DILIGENTLY WITH IN THE STAKEHOLDERS PROCESS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE IN ORDER TO MEET OUR GOAL SO WITH THAT. I'M I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU GUYS WORK WITH THE P. H. AND CONSIDER OUR COMMENTS TODAY THANK YOU. HIM. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FRED MAIN ON BEHALF OF CAL PACE THE. PROGRAM FOR THE ALL INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY IN THE STATE. OF. PACE IS. TRYING TO EXPAND. IN LIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PASSAGE OF THE PACE MODERNIZATION ACT. IN NOT TWO THOUSAND AND. AT SIXTEEN A TRYING IS THE OPERATIVE WORD THERE A ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR PACE ORGANIZATIONS IS THAT THEY NEED TO. BE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF. A PUBLIC HEALTH FOR A CLINIC AND EIGHTY EIGHT C. SOMETIMES A HOME HEALTH AGENCY LICENSE OR. ACHIEVE. APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTION. WHICH YOU'RE ALMOST AS DIFFICULT TO. ACQUIRE SO AS A RESULT PACES NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPAND. A AND. ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE. THE EXPANSION AUTHORIZATION. RIGHT NOW CLINIC APPLICATIONS ARE. BEING. ACTED OUT FROM APRIL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SO THAT'S QUITE A BACKLOG THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE EIGHTEEN MONTH PROCESS. THAT IT TAKES JUST UNDER THE A PERFECT ALIGNMENT OF. APPLICATION SO IT THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THAT DOESN'T UP AND THAT. APPLICATION BACKLOG THAT WERE AWARE OF WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY. THE BACKLOG FOR THE EITHER THE HOME HEALTH AGENCIES OR THE EIGHTY EIGHT C. SO. IT'S A BIG CONCERN. IT'S COSTLY FOR THE PACE ORGANIZATIONS. IN THEIR ABILITY TO START UP. OF WE DO. HAVE SOME HOPE FOR THE ELECTRONIC APPLICATION PROCESS IN THIS CENTRALIZED. STAFFING. BUT WE THINK THEY NEED TO BE. LINK TO REAL OUTCOMES DE A P. H. WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO MEET ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. FOR THE APPROVAL OF LICENSE APPLICATIONS FOR ALL PROVIDER TYPE SIMILAR TO THAT. HOSPITALS AND THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD PUBLISH PERIODIC UPDATES ON THE BACKLOG FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO AYE TRACK ITS PROGRESS. THANK YOU FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR. ISSUES TODAY. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHELLE CUT IT OUT WITH A CA YOU CALIFORNIA. HEALTH CARE DIVISION. AS YOU KNOW WE REPRESENT THE NEAREST PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WHO DO LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION FOR THE STATE AND WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO ENSURE GREATER INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM AT THAT TIME. WE WERE IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE. THE THOUGH WAY THAT THAT STATE WAS CALCULATING WORKFORCE NEEDS AT THAT TIME WOULD HAVE INDICATED THAT THE STATE NEEDED FEWER WORKERS NOT MORE AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE STATE HAS REVAMPED ITS PROCESS FOR HOW IT LOOKS AT WORKLOAD. AND. WOULD WELCOME AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS MENTIONED GETTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ON WHAT THOSE WORKLOAD PRETTY OUR PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON AND HOW THEY. HOW THEY WORK TO DAY I WILL NOTE THAT AT THAT TIME WE ALSO? MADE IT CLEAR TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE UNDER INVESTMENT IN THIS PROGRAM AND THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WERE SO DEEP THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO TURN THIS PROGRAM AROUND AND SO. WE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE PATIENTS THAT BRINGING ONBOARD SO MANY MORE STAFF WOULD TAKE TIME IT WOULD PUT ADDITIONAL STRESS ON THE EXISTING WORKFORCE WHO HAD TO DO DOUBLE DUTY AND TRYING TO. CLEAR BACKLOGS DEAL WITH THE WITH THE EXISTING OVER WORK BUT ALSO BRING NEW PEOPLE ONBOARD AND TRAIN THEM. AND. SO SO WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO BALANCE OUT PATIENTS AND SORT OF BRING THINGS TOGETHER. OVERTIME WITH THAT SAID I WILL SAY. RETENTION IN THIS PROGRAM WILL BE CHALLENGED BECAUSE THE STATE'S P. STRUCTURE IS SO LOW AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SORT OF BRING UP. THE THE PAIN BUT JUST TO KIND OF PUT IT IN CONTEXT THE STATE IS PAYING A MASTER'S LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE AROUND SIXTY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR. STARTING AND AND THE INDUSTRY WRIT LARGE IS PAYING MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT PIECE GALLON SO. IT'S EASY TO RECRUIT AWAY A HIGHLY EDUCATED VERY WELL TRAINED PUBLIC HEALTH'S HEALTH NURSE WHO'S GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING ALL THE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY. AND SO I THINK THIS IS JUST A CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE OVER THE YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE GET GREATER TRANSPARENCY. AND THAT WE MEET OUR COMMON GOAL OF IMPROVING SERVICE TO THE FACILITIES THAT ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE STATE WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC IS KEPT SAFE IN QUALITY FACILITIES AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MA'AM. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FRONT QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE. YOU CAN BE AFRAID THAT YOU LAST. WELL I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED I WANT TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I ACT. WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT THE END OF THE DAY THOUGH THE CONSUMERS ARE. ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE ARE AFFECTED SPECIFICALLY ON TALK ABOUT THE ELDERLY. AND THE THE OTHER SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES I'M I I WAS A TEACHER FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND DURING MY TENURE WE HAD A TEACHER SHORTAGE. AND THAT THERE WAS A POINT WHERE WE COULDN'T RECRUIT ENOUGH TEACHERS WE HAD QUITE A STATE AND WE HAVE TO GO OUT OF. THE COUNTRY TO RECRUITS ON THESE FOLKS NOW MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR BOTH SIDES. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT THE. PATIENT IS OF CONCERN BUT ALSO MY CONCERN IS WHERE WE CAN FIND ALL OF THESE. FOLKS TOO UP FILL THESE POSITIONS AND WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DOING YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM PAYING MORE OUT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO. TO RECRUIT THESE FOLKS BECAUSE I HAVE. TWENTY FIVE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN MY IN MY AYE DISTRICT AND ELEVEN OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. JULY FIRST. NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TRYING I WENT TO VISIT A FEW OF THEM AND THEY CAN'T RECRUIT FAST ENOUGH I SEE SEVERAL PROBLEMS I WAS ALSO A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND A LOT OF THE. THE ESPECIALLY CME PROGRAMS AT LEAST THE BASIC PART OF THAT SCENE A PROGRAMS WERE ELIMINATED DURING THE BUDGET CRISIS AND HAVE NOT BEEN BROUGHT UP. OUGHT TO FOLK FULL FULLY FUNDED OR SOME OF THE SPECIFICALLY MY AREA SOME OF THOSE. UP PROGRAMS WERE ELIMINATED AND HAVE NOT BEEN BROUGHT BACK AT ALL AND SO. HOW OLD ARE WE ASKING FOLKS TO COMPLY ON JULY FIRST ONE WHERE NOT EVEN PROVIDING? I DID HEAR THAT THERE WAS SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR TRAINING BUT WHERE THE PEOPLE COMING FROM. WE CAN HAVE ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD BUT IF WE'RE NOT RECRUITING ENOUGH FOLKS. TO TO BE TRAINED THEN HOW ARE WE EXPECTING THESE FACILITIES TO COMPLY. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO. TO ABOUT IT ONE NUMBER ONE RECRUIT BUT NUMBER TWO. I'M RETAIN BECAUSE I HEAR THAT. WE ARE RECRUITING SOME BUT THEY WERE NOT PAYING ENOUGH THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. BEATEN. THERE IS NOT IN EVIDENCE INCENTIVE FOR FOR THESE FOLKS TO STAY IN THESE FACILITIES SO WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DOING FOR. OR TO HELP WITH THAT. SO I I JUST WANT TO BE. CLEAR THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS THAT WORK IN THE FACILITIES AND OT THE NURSES THAT WORK FORCE SEEPAGE. THANK YOU OF FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. SO. YOU ARE CORRECT THAT YOU MEET WON'T BUT IT ALSO. IF IF WE IF WE TALK ABOUT THE THE. THE PAY SCALE FOR THAT THE. BUT RIGHT QUALIFIED ONE THAT IS AN ISSUE AS WELL I AGREE WITH IT SO. IN TERMS OF PAY SCALES FOR EITHER THE NURSES THAT THEY CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH FIRES OR FOR THE CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS THAT THE FACILITIES HIGHER WE WE CERTIFY THEM BUT WE DON'T HIRE THEM. WE DON'T WE WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER SETTING THOSE WHICH LEVELS YOU KNOW THE STATE'S CIVIL SERVICE CATEGORIES ARE SET AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. AND. INDUSTRY. THE DEMANDS OF INDUSTRY AND AND WHAT THEY WILL PAY ITS IS WHAT DRIVES THE SCENE A SALARY. WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THERE IS THERE. IS CLEARLY A NEED FOR MORE CNA TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE CNA TRAINING WE APPROVE. PROGRAMS THAT SEEK TO PROVIDE THAT TRAINING. AND THERE HAVE BEEN PROGRAMS THAT HAVE CLOSED OVER THE YEARS WE. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP A STATEMENT WAS MADE ALONG THE WAY. THAT I'M NOT CLEAR ON AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A MENTION THAT WE THE DEPARTMENT HAVE MONEY. FOR CNA TRAINING PROGRAMS AND THAT WAS NOT A CORRECT STATEMENT. BUT. WE DID WE DO HAVE WE HAVE A SORRY BUT CAN YOU CLARIFY THEN WHAT IS THE CORRECT STATEMENT. SO THAT THERE IS A UP THERE. WE HAVE A CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY COUNT THAT AS FEDERAL CITATION MONEY. THAT CAN BE USED ONLY. TWO FOR PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WE DO HAVE A PROPOSAL BEFORE US FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. FOR THEM TO WORK WITH TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WITH FACILITIES TO TRAIN MORE C. N. A.'S AND THEY WANT TO USE SOME OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY FOR THAT PROGRAM. THE USE OF THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THAT PROGRAM HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. WE ARE AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND THE CENTERS FOR MEDICAID MEDICARE SERVICES. TO. WORK ON THAT PROPOSAL SO THAT IT MEETS CMS IS APPROVAL SO THAT CMS WILL APPROVE THE USE OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY. TO HELP WITH THAT WHAT THEY'RE CALLING A KICKSTARTER TRAINING PROGRAM FOR CNN'S. LET ME JUMP IN JUST FOR A SECOND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE GOVERNOR AND HIS JANUARY BUDGET HAD INSERTED BELIEVE IT WAS TWO AND A HALF MILLION. THAT'S GOING TO LOOK TOWARDS THE. EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OR HIGHER ED THAT WILL HELP IN TRAINING. IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU KNOW AND IS THOSE ARE THOSE FUNDS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEED. I APOLOGIZE THAT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY AUGMENTATION FOR US OUTSIDE OF OUR BUDGET SO. SOON. AND I AM PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME TO IN FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND TWO POINT FIVE FOUR IN THE U. DD. WHAT IF A GOING? ONE ON OUR END AND ALONG THOSE LINES. THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW YOU KEEP SAYING WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO WHICH I APPRECIATE HOWEVER THE. THE THE THE COMPLIANCE IS JULY FIRST AND SO YOU SEE WHERE THE DISCONNECT IS WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO BUT YET THE FACILITIES ARE. ARE EXPECTED TO TO COMPLY BY JULY FIRST SO AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT ARE WEAK. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO COME TOGETHER WITH THE REALITY OF THIS DEBT DOES. DATE. TO COMPLY SO. TWO POINTS OF CLARIFICATION. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN AND CLARIFY SOME THINGS. THE IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE FOR THIS NEW STAFFING RATIO. IS IN THE LEGISLATION. IT IS NOT SET BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THEREFORE WE ARE ONLY YOU KNOW WE ARE BOUND BY THE TIMELINE THAT'S IN THE LEGISLATION AND. THE OTHER PIECE ON THE ON THE WAIVERS WE HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL NEED WAIVERS IN THE BEGINNING AND WHAT KIND OF WAIVERS AND CONCERNS WITH THE WAIVERS. AND I WOULD JUST I REMIND. THAT COMMITTEE AGAIN THAT. THE WAIVER PROCESS THE REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE THESE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAIVERS IS ALSO IN THE LEGISLATION AND THE LEGISLATION. MAKES IT INCUMBENT ON THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A WAIVER PROCESS SO IT'S NOT OUR CHOICE WHETHER WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE WAIVERS OR SHOULD NOT BE WAIVERS THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES. THAT WE DEVELOP PROCESSES FOR GRANTING WAIVERS. OKAY BUT IT SOLD SO THANK YOU BYE UP THE QUESTION STILL REMAINS WHERE WE CAN MAKE IT. I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION WHAT IS THE PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IF THESE WAIVERS ARE. ISSUED THEN THEN WHAT WHAT HAPPENS. TO ENCOURAGE OUR INCENTIVIZE OF THE WAIVERS BECAUSE THAT WHAT WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME IS WE'RE GONNA GIVE WAIVERS RIGHT. BUT THEN IF THERE'S NO PLAN TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS THEN. AND ANOTHER YOUR WORK AND ASKING FOR ANOTHER WAIVER THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE OF THAT THE WAIVER THE WAIVER IS. THIS IS THE PLAN THIS IS WHAT WE'RE I MEAN I'M ASSUMING RIGHT THAT IF YOU ISSUE A WAIVER THEN THE PLAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO COMPLY BY EX. PICK A DATE. SO THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN IS BECAUSE I KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT LEGISLATION WAS A IMPLEMENTED BY. YOUR. IT'S IT'S HERE. SO YOU HAVE THE SAME PRESSURE AS THE FACILITIES TO TO TO TRY AND COME TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN FIND THE A SOLUTION TO. SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO SEE JAY HOWARD TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IN STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ABOUT WHAT WE ENVISION THE WAIVER PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE ABOUT WHO WE'LL GET THEM. HOWLONG THEY WOULD LAST THE CONDITIONS FOR GETTING THEM? IS THAT WOULD THAT BE. PUPPET YOUR QUESTION. SO THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES US TO IMPLEMENT THREE POINT FIVE AND TWO POINT FOUR SO WE'RE INCREASING THE NURSING HOURS PER PATIENT DAY FROM THREE POINT TO TURN OVER ALL OF THREE POINT FIVE AND TWO POINT FOUR OF THOSE HOURS MUST BE PROVIDED BY CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS. THE LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR TWO WAIVERS TO THE REVISED STANDARD SO ONE IS A WAIVER TO THE TWO POINT FOUR CM A REQUIREMENT BASED ON PATIENT ACUITY. SORT OTHER WORDS OF FACILITY WOULD STILL NEED TO MEET THREE POINT FIVE BUT BASED OFF OF THEIR PATIENT MIX FOR THE ACUITY OF THEIR PATIENTS THEY MIGHT HAVE MORE ARE ENDS IN LV ENDS AND FEWER SEEN AS IF THEY'RE STILL MADE IN THE THREE POINT FIVE. THE SECOND WAIVER. ALLOWS OF FACILITY TO WAVE TO POINT FOUR AND OR THREE POINT FIVE PROVIDED THEY STILL ME AND OVERALL STAFFING LEVELS THREE POINT TO USE OF THE CURRENT OR EXISTING STANDARD. THE DEPARTMENTS HELD FOR PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS TO AGGREGATE AT THAT. CONCERNS. AND IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THESE WAIVERS. THE MATERIALS FROM ALL THESE ARE INTERNET AND WE WILL BE RELEASING SO THE WAY THAT THIS WHOLE ALL COME TOGETHER IS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND ALL FACILITIES LETTERS. AND THAT'LL BE RELEASED BY MARCH THIRTIETH. SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE WAIVER IS FOR THE FACILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE A IS A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN THEIR REGION. AND BE THAT THEY HAVE MADE. STRIDENT EFFORTS TO HIRE SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF STAFF AND THEN THE IN SCRANTON THE WAIVERS OF CURRENTLY OUTLINED THE NEED TO SHOW US A SERIES OF STEPS THAT THEY PLAN TO TAKE TO FULLY STAFF AND TO BE FULLY STAFFED AT. TWO POINT FOUR AND THREE POINT FIVE AND THEY CAN ONLY RENEW THE WAIVER FOR AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF YEARS. SO THREE SO YOU GET A FEW THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR IT IN THE CAR PROPOSAL AN INITIAL WAIVER AND TWO RENEWALS AND AFTER THREE YEARS YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET A WAIVER. AND ANOTHER PIECE OF GRANTING THE WAIVERS THAT THE FACILITY REQUESTING A WAIVER ACOSTA HAS TO DEMONSTRATE. TO THE DEPARTMENT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S PLAN FOR ASSURING THAT IT CAN PROVIDE. PROPER CARE TO THE RESIDENTS AT THE LOWER LEVEL. JUMP IN FOR A SECOND IF I CAN. FIRST I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE TO. MAKE UP STATEMENT THAT WERE ON BOARD WITH SUPPORTING THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL INTERESTS ARE PRESENT IN ABLE TO BE HEARD AND THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN A CONSTRUCTIVE. PATTERN. I BELIEVE THE GOAL IS TO GET TO THREE POINT FIVE AND REALLY WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE MISSING HAS HOW. AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THE FOREIGN A HALF MILLION THAT WAS INSERTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO REACH THAT GOAL. AND IF NOT IS THERE A NECESSITY FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO STEP UP. BECAUSE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE PROVIDE THE STAFFING RATIO TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY AND RESIDENTS OF NURSING HOMES. HAS JUST BEEN A BAD ONE EITHER. POINT OF INTEREST WHICH IS THAT MY. MEDICAL COLLEAGUES HAVE TOLD ME THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND. FOR ADD ONS TO SNIFF MEDICAL RATES FOR NON COMPLIANT% FACILITIES THAT'S ANOTHER. POSSIBLE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. CAN YOU KNOW. AT SOME POINT THERE IS A CAPACITY TO THE TRAINING OF SEEING EYES OF SWELLED THE. THEY HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER THEY CAN DO WENT OVER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WEEKS. IT SEEMS AS IF IF I RECALL FROM LAST YEAR WE NEED TO TEN THOUSAND NEW SEE AND EYES TO MEET THIS INCREASE REQUIREMENT. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE CAPACITY IS FOR TRAINING OF INDIVIDUALS NOW AND HOW LONG WE WOULD. ANTICIPATED TO BRING THAT MAN. I'M TRYING TO AGAIN DRIVE TOWARDS HOW DO WE HELP MAKE SURE WE CAN MEET THE OBLIGATIONS WE PUT IN STATUTE PASSED HERE. I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION I'M I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE. BIG BECAUSE WE ONLY AYE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT CERTIFY THE TRAINING PROGRAMS WE DON'T HAVE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TODAY I'M GOOD DATA FOR YOU ON. WHAT THE DIM YOU KNOW HOW MANY SEE IN A IS FACILITIES WOULD NEED TO MEET THE STAFFING RATIO? VERSUS HOW MANY SEE AN AIDS THERE ARE AVAILABLE WE DO HAVE DATA. FROM ET DE TELLING US HOW MANY SEE AN AIDS BY COUNTY ARE IN THE ARE IN THE WORK FORCE AND THAT'S PART OF THAT WILL USE THAT DATA IN EVALUATING EACH INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES. WAIVER REQUEST OF DEMONSTRATING IF THERE'S A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE BUT. AYE WHEAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD INFORMATION FOR YOU ON WHAT THE WHAT THE NEED IS AND HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL THAT NEED. CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS THIS GOES FORWARD AND WILL HAVE FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT. WALTON MORE THAN THAT THEM MONITORING WELL IT. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU DIRECTLY IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS ARE FROM FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS IF YOU CAN KEEP US POSTED AS WELL BECAUSE. MEET YOUR YOU'RE ALL HAVING THESE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND. I'M NOT SURE AT WHAT POINT YOU INVOLVED I'VE I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME REGULAR UPDATES FROM BOTH SIDES TO SEE WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE I. WHEN THIS HAPPENS I DON'T WANT US TO TO BE IN A HURRY AGAIN AND THEN. THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS DOESN'T BREAKS DOWN AT SOME POINT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN. WE PREVENT ANY KIND OF BREAKDOWN AND YOU KEEP US IN THE LOOP SO THAT WE CAN ASSIST YOU IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN. INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW THE ELEVENTH HOUR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THIS WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO THAT WHAT I'LL DO. WHEN WE RETURN IS ALL OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DATE INCLUDING MINUTES OF OUR MEETINGS. LETTERS FROM THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES ON THEIR POSITIONS DRAFTS OF OUR PROPOSALS AND. POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS FROM OUR STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ARE ALL POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE SO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET YOU A LINK TO THAT WEBSITE. DARE FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING KNOWING SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THIS THEY'RE NOT THAT SHOT I AM SURE WE'LL HEAR WHAT THEY WANT THEIR ANOTHER. YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON IF I COULD AND. SORRY DOT WOULD. DIE PROJECTS IF IF I MISS THIS DISCUSSION EARLIER. I'VE HEARD ABOUT CHALLENGES WITH RESURFACING OF C. N. A.'S AND AND HOW SLOW THAT PROCESS IS. CAN EXPLAIN WHY THAT PROCESS IS. SO SLOW ARE THEY HAVING TO FILL OUT PAPER APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL AS WELL. AND. BECAUSE THAT IS THAT THAT MIGHT BE OF WHICH I HAVE FROM PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT IS THAT THAT IS. WITHOUT THE CERTIFICATES OR WITHOUT THE RENEWAL THEY CAN'T WORK. AND YET. THEY CAN'T GET THERE RENEWAL BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING SO LONG TO GET INTO. SO LIKE I SAID EARLIER YOU KNOW I'VE GOT IT WHEN I RENEW MY DENTAL LICENSE I CAN DO THAT ONLINE. AND IT TAKES VERY LITTLE TIME WILL HAVE WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS FROM THE PROCESS AND. YET WE'RE HEARING ANECDOTALLY THAT IS TAKING A LONG LONG TIME TO GET RENEWALS FOR CNN SO. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE BOTTLENECK GIVES AND. HOW WE'RE GOING TO ALLEVIATE THAT SO THAT WE CAN? ACTUALLY HAVE THE WORKFORCE WE HAVE BE ABLE TO WORK IN THE AND FACILITIES WHERE THEY NEED TO BE THERE TO HELP PROVIDE PATIENT CARE. AND MY COLLEAGUE ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU. SO THE THE CURRENT PROCESS IS A PAPER BASED PROCESS ROUGHLY FOUR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE C. N. A.'S EXPIRATION WE SEND OUT A NOTICE REMIND IN THE C. N. A THAT IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO RENEW. BACK IN THE SUMMER AND NOVEMBER OUR PROCESSING TIME HAD BECOME QUITE A FLAG PILLARS UPWARDS OF THIRTY DAYS FOR US TO TURN AROUND. TO TURN AROUND OF THE REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION AYE WE'VE SUBSEQUENTLY DRIVEN THAT PROCESS DOWN TO TWO OR THREE DAYS THE LAST REPORT THAT I GOT TODAY WAS IT WEIRD NOW TURNING THOSE AROUND AND THREE DAYS THAT JUST MEANS OF THAT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT WAS APPROVED WITHIN THREE DAYS IT COULD BE THAT WE'VE GOT AN INCOMPLETE APPLICATION BUT WILL LET BURDENS HAVE A TURN AROUND TIME A VOLLEY OF THIRTY FIVE DAYS IT'S NOW DOWN TO TWO OR THREE. SO IT'S MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE WE ARE MOVING WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO TO AN ONLINE APPLICATION SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE GET APPLICATIONS AN ERROR OR INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS. SO THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET IT IN THE FIRST TIME AND WE CAN BE APPROVING THE SCENE A RENEWALS IN A MATTER OF DAYS RATHER THAN A MATTER OF MONTHS OR WEEKS. I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT WE ARE MONITORING HONOR ON A WEEKLY BASIS THE TURN AROUND TIME OF THOSE APPLICATION RENAULT SO IT'S THIS IS A HIGH. PRIORITY ON OUR RADAR SCREEN THAT WE ARE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY. OF JUST HOW HOW LENGTHY OF APPLE AT HOW LINK THE IS THE APPLICATION FOR RENEWAL. ACTUALLY. I DON'T HAVE IT I DON'T OFFICE OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW I CAN I CAN TELL YOU WHAT ONE OF THOSE WHAT WE WHAT WE SEE IS ONE OF THE COMMON PROBLEMS I APOLOGIZE IT ON HOW LONG APPLICATION IS. SIENESE HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS SPREAD OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OVER HOW MUCH CAN BE DONE IN ANY ONE YEAR. AND THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE THERE'S THE MOST. DIFFICULTY IN RENEWAL APPLICATIONS. EITHER WITH. APPLICANTS. GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT APPLICANTS TO VERIFY. THE LEGITIMACY OF THEIR. EDUCATION CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS OR. ENSURING THAT THEY WERE DISTRIBUTED APPROPRIATELY OVER THE TWO YEARS AND SOMETIMES WHEN. THEY ARE NOT THE INITIAL APPLICATION DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION WE THEN HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE APPLICANT. WITH THE PROCESS FOR THEM TO TEST IN BACK INTO A RENEWAL. IS THERE A RHYME OR REASON THOUGH WHY THE CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE SPLIT UP BETWEEN. THE ERRORS IT STATURE ITS AND STATUTES THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE RE LOOKED AT AS WERE STARTING TO RECOGNIZE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND. NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AS MANY CAPABLE BODIES AS WE CAN. I I DON'T THINK WE CAN COMMENT ON YOUR PARTICULAR QUESTIONS AT THE STATURE RESET TEN HOURS THE TO BE DONE IN ONE YEAR AND TEN HOURS THE SECOND YEAR SAYS THERE'S A TWENTY ARE A REQUIREMENT FOR THE CONTINUING EDUCATION SPLIT OVER. TWO YEARS SO WHETHER NOT THAT SHOULD BE REVAMPED UP MY DON'T THINK WE HAVE A A COMMENT ON THAT. FAIR ENOUGH. I WAS HOPING TO. ARE YOU. I WAS HOPING TO. TAKE A LOOK AT THE LICENSING FEES I WAS MOVED BY. WHAT CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND AS WELL AS KELPIE SAID? REGARDING THE LONG WAIT TIMES PARTICULARLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT INCREASES AND FEES. ARE WE DELIVERING ON. TIME. TO ENSURE THAT OUR APPLICATIONS ARE BEING PROCESSED IN A REALISTIC TIME FRAME IT SEEMS AS IF THAT'S A CONSISTENT THEME THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY. AND HOPEFULLY BY MAY REVISE YOU CAN PROVIDE US SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG AND PATHWAYS FORWARD TO HELP TO STREAMLINE. THIS PROCESS I CAN GIVE YOU. A LOT OF INFORMATION KNOWING CERTAINLY UPDATE YOU BY MAY REVISE SO. A LOT MORE THAN A YEAR AGO WE UNDERTOOK A PROCESS. TO. CENTRALIZE ALL OF THESE APPLICATIONS INTO HEADQUARTERS THEY USED TO BE PROCESSED. IN OUR FOURTEEN DISTRICT OFFICES AND ONE OF THE. ME DOWNSIDES OF THAT WAS INCONSISTENCIES AND APPROVAL OF APPLICATIONS AND AND PROVIDERS THAT ARE STATEWIDE. FACING INCONSISTENCIES AND WE WE KNEW. ON OUR OWN IN AND AND FROM A CONSULTANT'S RECOMMENDATION THAT REALLY CENTRALIZING THAT PROCESS WITHIN SACRAMENTO WAS THE WAY TO GO. IN THE PROCESS OF BEGINNING THAT WE UNDER ESTIMATED THE WORKLOAD THAT THAT WAS GOING TO REQUIRE SO WEAK KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S BEEN AND IS CURRENTLY AT THIS MOMENT A SIGNIFICANT. BACKLOG IN TURNING AROUND THESE APPLICATIONS WE'VE TAKEN UNDERTAKEN MANY STEPS TO IMPROVE THIS PROCESS INCLUDING. REORGANIZING THAT UNITS SO THAT WE HAVE. WORKERS THAT ARE TRAINED AND SPECIALIZED IN EACH FACILITY TYPE OF APPLICATION SO THEY CAN PROCESS THE MORE EFFECTIVELYAND EFFICIENTLY REPAIRED ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORS WE'VE HIRED. MANY ADDITIONAL STAFF INCLUDING RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF FIRING THIRTY LIMITED TERM STAFF TO TRY TO BRING THAT BACKLOG DOWN. WE HAVE DEVELOPED WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING. AUTOMATED APPLICATION PROCESS SEIZE RITUAL UP HAVE GREAT BENEFIT OVER THE LONG TERM AND WE'VE BEGUN WITH SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND OTHER FACILITIES THAT. FILL OUT THE SAME FORMS AND THOSE FORMS. WILL GO LIVE WE HOPE SOMETIME IN THE NEXT MONTH SO THAT SHOULD IMPROVE THE PROCESSING TIME AS WELL THIS IS ANOTHER AREA MISSION AS WITH THE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION BRANCH. WE MONITOR OUR. INPUT OUTPUT AND TRANSFER WEEKLY AND THERE WERE SOME COMMENTS ALONG THE WAY FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT. WANTING TO SEE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN THAT AREA WE ARE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT ARE BROKEN DOWN YOU CAN YOU THERE BE. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT LIFE YET WE'RE STILL WORKING ON CLEANING UP THE DATA THEYSHOULD BE LIVE VERY SOON. AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO PICK BY ANY PER. APPLICATION TYPE FACILITY TIBOR APPLICATION WITH THERE'S A CHANGE OF NAME A CHAIN OF OWNERSHIP FOR GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. ANY CONSUMER ANY INTERESTED PERSON WOULD BE ABLE TO GO IN REAL TIME CHECK THE BOXES WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN AND GET DATA ON WHAT OUR PERFORMANCES SO THAT THAT. ANYONE CAN MONITOR OUR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS THEIR MAPS QUITE ENCOURAGING I BELIEVE IT'S GOOD GOVERNANCE TO ENSURE THAT WERE BEING. FIDUCIARY THE RESPONSIBLE TO TAXPAYERS AND TO THE FACILITIES THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THAT SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT BY ME REVISE WE'D HAVE A PLAN IT LOOKING FORWARD. WITH THAT ASSET WAS RECOMMENDED NO ACTION ON THIS ITEM WILL HOLD IT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FORTY. SINCE OUR ISSUE FOURTEEN OTHER YUGOSLAV ARMY IF IT'S HIDDEN YOU CAN. MY. THE STORE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IF WE MAY AND THEN WE'LL PROCED. THEY WANT TO PROVIDE A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE LA COUNTY BUDGET REQUESTING AN OVERVIEW OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL FEE AND IF YOU'D LIKE AT THAT TIME I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. BUT HOW MUCH HOW MUCH I DO AT THAT POINT. SO FOR THE LA COUNTY BUDGET REQUESTS WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE. OF THE STATE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH LICENSE IN CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FUND. THIS'LL ACTUALLY FUND A TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE TO THE CONTRACTS BUDGET BECAUSE THERE WAS AN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR BASELINE ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS BUILT INTO LAST YEAR'S PCP. THAT AND ALSO INCREASED THE LA COUNTY CONTRACT BUDGET LEAVE AT THAT POINT BY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS SO THE OVERALL INCREASE YOUR YEAR FOR LA COUNTY IS ACTUALLY TWO POINT SEVEN WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR THE ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY. TO FUND CHANGES TO THE INDIRECT COST RATE. SALARIES AND BENEFITS. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE PROPOSING A SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE FEE ON LA COUNTY FACILITIES. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS FEE IS TO DO IS TO OFFSET THE HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERSONNEL AND. AND LA COUNTY IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IT WOULD HAVE COST THE STATE TO DO THE WORK AT STATE SALARIES COMPARED WITH WHAT IT DOES COST THE STATE. TO PAY FOR THE LA COUNTY CONTRACT AND SO THIS IS SO THAT FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF LA COUNTY NO LONGER BEAR A PORTION OF THE HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LA COUNTY CONTRACT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ANGELO BOLOGNA I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH PROTECTION FOR LA COUNTY. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS A MARK OR ON A SEE WHO IS THE. DIVISION HEAD FOR THE HEALTH FACILITIES INSPECTION DIVISION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I GOT A VERY BRIEF LESS THAN THREE MINUTES STATEMENT I'M GONNA READ. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH UNDER LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. CONTRACTS WITH LA COUNTY TO PERFORM FEDERAL CERTIFICATION OF LOCAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. AND TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS AND FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE FINAL YEAR OF A THREE YEAR CONTRACT. THIS IS A THREE YEAR CONTRACT THAT SORT OF ITS BEEN REPEATING ITSELF FOR SEVERAL DECADES. THAT THE LA COUNTY'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM. FIRST THE COUNTY DOES SUPPORT AND THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR THE PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE CONTRACT FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. THROUGH FY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND TO INCREASE OUR FUNDING BY ONE POINT NINE MILLION. HOWEVER THIS AMOUNT IS INSUFFICIENT TO FULLY FUND THE CONTRACT. AND THE COUNTY IS REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT NINE MILLION FOR YEAR FOR. A CLOSE THE DEFICIT. AND TO COVER THE COST OF DELIVERING THESE CRUCIAL SERVICES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AS THE SUBCOMMITTEE MAY RECALL FOUR YEARS AGO THERE WERE A SERIES OF NEWS REPORTS AND AUDITS. WHICH UNCOVERED POOR PERFORMANCE BY LA COUNTY. AND QUITE FRANKLY BY POOR PERFORMANCE AND MISMANAGEMENT THE PROGRAM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN LA COUNTY WE DISCOVERED THAT THE HEART OF THIS PROGRAM OR THIS PROBLEM. WAS THE CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING OF THE PROGRAM. WHILE LA COUNTY WAS GIVEN THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THE STATE'S WORKLOAD WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF THE FUNDING. THE UNDERFUNDING RESULTED IN A BACKLOG OF PENDING COMPLAINTS AND FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS THAT REQUIRED RESOLUTION. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT ENTERED INTO A NEW THREE YEAR CONTRACT THAT INCREASED OUR FUNDING AND TIED IT TO A DEFINED WORK PLAN. FOR EACH YEAR OF THE CONTRACT. LA COUNTY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN THE PROGRAM FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE. TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR. AND WE'RE VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN LA COUNTY HAS PRODUCED VERY GOOD RESULTS. HELLO COUNTY MET IN IN SOME CASES EXCEEDED OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN YEARS ONE AND TWO. AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO DO THE SAME IN YEAR THREE. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE CONTRACT WE RECRUITED AND HIRED SEVENTY FIVE NEW STAFF. WHICH THEN AS YOU KNOW UNDERGOES PAY FOR BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE OF TRAINING IN ORDER TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE THIS TRAINING TAKES APPROXIMATELY TWELVE MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THE COUNTIES VACANCY RATE IS CURRENTLY NINE POINT FOUR PERCENT. AND OUR STAFF TURNOVER RATE IS NINE POINT ONE PERCENT. VERSES THE STATE'S TURNOVER RATE OF NEARLY FIFTEEN PERCENT. LA COUNTY HAS PERFORMED THIS WORK ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND FACT WE REMAIN THE ONLY COUNTY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE DOES THIS TYPE OF WORK IN EVERY OTHER JURISDICTION OF THE COUNTRY THE PROGRAM IS RUN EXCLUSIVELY BY THE STATE. LA COUNTY IS COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS PROGRAM THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN THE NATION. AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR COMMITMENT IS ALIGNED WITH UNIQUE VULNERABILITY OF PATIENTS AND RESIDENTS. THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR OF HEALTH CARE FACILITY SETTING. EFFORTS TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY DEMAND SUFFICIENTLY STAFF TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE INSPECTIONS. WE ARE THEREFORE REQUESTING THIS ADDITIONAL ONE POINT NINE MILLION IN FY THE BUDGET YEAR. TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE CONTRACTED SERVICES THE PROTECT THE POPULATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR REQUEST WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO. SONYA PARTICULARLY. WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE DIFFERING COST ESTIMATES FROM BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND LA COUNTY AND. IT LOOKS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE THE ONE POINT NINE MILLION DIFFERENCE IS REALLY THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS TO SORT OF TECHNICAL FACTORS ONE IS A DIFFERENCE IN WHICH INDIRECT COSTS TREAT THEIR EACH USING AND ONE HAS TO DO WITH. ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT STAFFING VACANCIES AND THE ASSOCIATED SALARIES. WE WOULD NOTE THAT MOST OF THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO. COMING UP WITH THE LA COUNTY ESTIMATE ARE REALLY BASED ON FACTORS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO LA COUNTY SUCH AS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION DUE TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I'M THE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS RATE. AND ALSO THE FUNCTIONAL HOURS. PER FULL TIME POSITION. WE ALSO NOTE THAT IN THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS OF THIS CURRENT CONTRACT WHICH THEY HOPE TO EXTEND. THE. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH USED THE INDIRECT COST STREET THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE LA COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLER. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE WOULD RECOMMEND GOING WITH THE LA COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLER APPROVED INDIRECT COST STREET WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AN AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ABOVE WHAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS REQUESTED FOR THE CONTRACT. WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND. APPROVAL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE FEE IN LA COUNTY. AND WE THINK THIS GUY IS BETTER ALIGNS THE FUNDING WITH THE. COSTS ESOS THE REGULATORY COSTS. AND WITH THE THE FACILITIES THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT REGULATION. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ADOPT OUR PROPOSAL. IT MAY REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO. TAKE A LOOK AT THE SUPPLEMENTAL FEES THAT THEY'VE PROPOSED FOR LA COUNTY TO SEE IF THERE WOULD BE ANY ADJUSTMENT NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AT THIS TIME WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FORTY. A GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS TIED JONES AND I'M HEALTH FACILITIES EVALUATOR NURSE WITH LA COUNTY AND ALSO AT SEIU LOCAL SEVEN TWO AND NUMBER. AND PRIOR TO BECOMING AN EVALUATOR I PRACTICE AS A REGISTERED NURSE. AND THAT DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE SETTINGS GERIATRICS IN PEDIATRICS. AND. DURING THAT EXPERIENCE I WAS COMPELLED TO CALL TO ATTENTION AREAS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT. WHERE DEFICIENT PRACTICES EXISTED? AND I SAW IT AS AN INJUSTICE TO OUR PATIENTS AND THAT WE SERVED BECAUSE OF THESE DEFICIENT PRACTICES. I'M SORRY CENTER TODAY ISN'T EVALUATOR NURSE AND COMMITTED TO PROVIDE CARE TO OUR PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. BY ENSURING THAT FACILITIES MEET THE STANDARDS SET BY FEDERAL LAW AND FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND TO MEET THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS. AND IF IF FACILITIES PROVIDE SUBSTANDARD CARE AND THEY PUT PATIENTS LIVES AT RISK. AND IT MAY CAUSE THEM SIGNIFICANT HARM. THIS TIME CAN BE THE RESULT OF A FIST STILL EFFORT MILLER. THE FACILITIES FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR CLIENTELE FROM ABUSE AND NEGLECT. AS WELL AS FROM THE PROVISION OF SOME SUB STANDARD QUALITY OF CARE. I HOPE FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE BY WRITING DEFICIENCIES AND CITATIONS SO WE MAY IMPROVE HOW THEY DELIVER CARE TO AYE CLIENTELE. AND ULTIMATELY PROVIDE SAFE INCOMPETENT CARE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN LACOUNTY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN ACTION TO ADDRESS HOW SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED WE WERE. WE HAVE MET OR EXCEEDED OUR OUTCOMES IN OUR AREAS AND HAVE BEEN CONTRACT THAT WE'VE BEEN CONTRACTED TO PERFORM. THAT WE BELIEVE THAT SUCCESS WE'VE HAD IN RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND PERFORMANCE HAVE SERVED LA COUNTY RESIDENTS TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS STILL NOT CONTRACTED BY THE STATE TO PERFORM ALL THE WORK AND I COUNTY. AND IT BREAKS OUR HEARTS WHEN THERE IS NOT A STATE PLAN TO ADDRESS THE WORK THAT HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMED. WE KNOW LIVES ARE AT RISK. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAVE INCOMPETENT OF CARE SERVICES AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A SOLUTION TO ADEQUATELY STAFFED LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. AND TO SHARE THE LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THE LAST FEW YEARS OF INVESTMENT. AS MORE CHANGES REQUIRED TO BETTER SERVE AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN OUR GREAT STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION. TO LOOK AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. AND TO HELP GET US ON THE RIGHT TRACK TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES THE CRUCIAL SERVICES REQUIRE. TO ADVOCATE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE MEMBERS I COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE. WHO CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES? THANK YOU. JENNIFER SENATOR MATH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HOPE FACILITIES JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IN THAT MEDIUM ACTUALLY PROVIDED A CHART THAT'S IN THE ANALYSIS. IT JUST TO POINT OUT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN LICENSE FEES HAVE BEEN INCREASED THINK ALMOST UPWARDS OF EIGHTY PERCENT FOR FACILITIES SO. TO AGAIN COME BACK THIS YEAR AND ASK AGAIN FOR AN INCREASE IN OUR LICENSING FEES. MEAN HAS AN IMPACT ON THE REVENUE THAT A FACILITY HAS IF THEY'RE SPENDING. YOU KNOW CONTINUING TO SPENDING AN ARM EXERTED AMOUNT OF MONEY ON ON LICENSING FEES WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT. WE GENERALLY IN THE PAST HAVE NOT OPPOSED INCREASES IN LICENSING FEES. OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SUPPORT ONLY COUNTIES EFFORTS I'M JUST I THINK WE SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS TYPE OF REQUEST LATELY. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ATTACHED TO THIS WATER THE. OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THE STATE TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEM RIGHT FUNDING TO LA COUNTY AND. AND MAYBE PUT LESS BURDEN ON ADDITIONAL LICENSING FEES FOR FACILITIES SO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT HOW HOW MUCH THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASED IN THE LAST YEAR'S IT'S IT'S PRETTY. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. Q.. BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION MY COMMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO ON JENNIFER'S FROM CALF. ON BUT FOR HOSPITALS IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHETHER WE REALLY KNOW. ON EXACTLY WHAT THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL WILL END UP BEING IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. BUT FOR HOSPITALS ARE FEES ARE BEING RAISED IN THE LA COUNTY THE PROPOSAL'S TRACE THEM BY FIFTY DOLLARS PER BED. FOR THE HOSPITALS AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHY THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE SO MUCH WITH THE WORKLOAD. IS NOT DONE BY THE LA COUNTY IN THE HOSPITAL'S MOST OF IT IS DONE BY. THE REGIONAL STAFF OF CTP H. SO WE DO WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE INCREASED HOSPITALS WE DO QUESTION IT. AND THEN WE ALSO QUESTION ON. HOW MUCH? AND LOOK LOOK LOOKING DOWN A YEAR OR TWO FROM NOW HOW MUCH THE ENTIRE WORKLOAD WILL END UP COSTING IN LA COUNTY BECAUSE SURELY THAT WILL RAISE FEES AGAIN. SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS TWENTY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL NEEDS A BIT MORE WORK TO MAKE SURE WE GET A TOTALITY AND A CLEAR PICTURE AND SO I WOULD ASK THAT WE. WORK WITH OUR STAFF TO GET A BETTER SENSE BY MAY REVISE. I. AM SUPPORTIVE IN PRINCIPLE OF. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT LA COUNTY IS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE BEFORE US BUT WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND THIS ISSUE THAT WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT WILL HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT COMING YEARS AND? CAN PREPARE FOR THAT AS WELL. SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THAT THIS ITEM OPEN AND THAT WILL CONCLUDE TODAY'S HEARING. THANK YOU
