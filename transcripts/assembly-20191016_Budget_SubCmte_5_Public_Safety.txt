VALUE COMPASS IS A LOT OF STUFF OF BASICALLY THE DAY TO DAY PRISON OPERATIONS AS WELL AS PAROLE I CAN SAY THAT I'M PROUD OF BEEN PART OF THE EVOLUTION. I'VE BEEN IN THIS DEPARTMENT A VERY LONG TIME AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS CHANGE OVER THE OVER THE YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE PUT REHABILITATION LEARNING AND UNFORTUNATELY SO SUBSEQUENT TO THAT WE LOST ALL THE- LARGE PORTION OF THE FUNDING FOR WE- SINCE THAT TIME THANKS TO LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REBUILD OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM TO WHERE THEY'RE MEANINGFUL PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AND A REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO BE A PART OF THAT EVOLUTION BUT PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF ARE SHE REFORMS OF SOME FROM LITIGATION AND SOME INDEPENDENTLY WE CHOSE TO CHANGE OUR OUR MATRIX FOR SECURITY HOUSING WHAT PENALTIES GET YOU THERE WE INDIVIDUALLY THAT THAT. WE CUT THAT POPULATION. HELLO HELLO. YEAH AUTONOMOUS ALL OVER INDIA. WE FORTUNATELY. THAT POPULATION IN HALF AND IS THERE MORE TO DO I THINK THERE IS AND IT'S THINGS THAT WE CERTAINLY LOOK AT OUR CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM TO SEE WHAT OUR OTHER CHANGES WERE WE DO WE'RE LOOKING OUT OUR RECEPTION CENTER PROCESSING TO STREAMLINE THE TIME IT TAKES TO GO THROUGH A RECEPTION CENTER PROCESSING. TO GET PEOPLE TO PROGRAMS GET INTO INSTITUTIONS WHERE THEY CAN PROGRAM BEEN VERY FORTUNATE. THAT THIS DEPARTMENT HAS EMBRACED THE VARIOUS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS RIGHT WAS STARTED REALIGNMENT SUBSEQUENT TO REALIGNMENT WE HAD PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX FORTY SEVEN I HAD THE PLEASURE LEADING THOSE EFFORTS UP IN MY PRIOR POSITION AND IN THE DIFFERENCE AT THAT MADE THE VERY YOUTHFUL OFFENDER BILLS. HAVE EMBRACED IT WE'VE BEEN BRACED TO THE POINT OF UTILIZING A SECTION OF OUR PENAL CODE. THAT AFFORDS US AN OPPORTUNITY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BACK TO THE COURTS FOR RE SENTENCING. WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THAT ABILITY BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU I'VE RARELY IF EVER SAW A RECALL OF. NOW WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF INMATES REFERRED BACK TO THE COURTS FOR RECALL OF SENTENCE. THAT'S HUGE THAT'S US PUTTING OUR NAME ON SOMEBODY SAYING YEAH WE THINK THAT WE ASK THE COURT TO RE EVALUATE. AND WE'VE SEEN OVERWHELMING NOT ALL COUNTIES NOT ALL JUDGES BUT WE HAVE SEEN SUPPORT FOR THAT AND SO WE'RE HOPEFUL IN THE FUTURE AS WE FINALIZE SOME REGULATIONS SO THERE'S VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA AND EVERYBODY KNOWS SECRETARY. SO IT'S NOT A YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE CRITERIA EVERYBODY WILL KNOW WE WILL BE IN TO REGULATIONS. WE HOPE TO EXPAND FURTHER ON SOME OF OUR YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PROGRAMMING YOU KNOW THERE WAS LEGISLATION COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT AFFORDED US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLACE YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS AND LOWER LEVELS. WERE LOWER LEVELS WITHOUT PROGRAMMING. DIDN'T A LOT IT SAID GUYS FROM BEING A LEVEL FOUR BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GO FURTHER. AND WE ARE WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR EDUCATION PROGRAMS IMMENSELY WE HAVE FACE TO FACE COLLAGEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR PRISON. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF INSTITUTIONS I HAVE FOR YOUR PROGRAMS. UCLA OFFERS A AT LA SEE THROUGH PELL GRANT FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE PROGRAM. AND WE HAD SOME INMATES GRADUATE WITH A FOUR YEAR DEGREE OTHERS CAN GET THEM THROUGH COAST LINE CALL. TUITION VERSES A PATH SO WE KNOW WE LONG WAY TO GO IN THAT AREA A LOT OF OUR VERY HIGH LEVEL SKILLED VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS OUR ACCOUNT. OUR CODING FOR CUTTING PROGRAM. BUILDING PROGRAMS ARE WATER RUNNING PROGRAMS I MEAN THERE'S NUMEROUS PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT THE INTENT OF THEM IS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF JUST THIS PAST WEEK ATTENDING A GRADUATION FOR WHAT WE CALL OUR PRINTER TRAINS AND- SO THAT ARE GO ABOUT IS A FIRE CAMP SO IT MADE SURE FIRE CAMP COULD APPLY TO GO TO THE THEATER TRAINS IN OUR SUPPORT. THEY'RE PAID TO BE THERE BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION. WE'VE HAD SIXTY FIVE GRADUATES OF THAT PROGRAM SOME OF WHICH YOU ALREADY WORKING FOR CALIFORNIA SO I WAS SPEAKING IN AT NOON. ON ON. FRIDAY AND THEY WERE ACTIVATED IMMEDIATELY UPON GRADUATION TO THE LA FIRES SO THAT IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM RIGHT THAT IS REALLY HAVE A QUICK TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE ALL FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT. IT'S WORKING FOR THE PART. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DON SPECTER ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON LAW OFFICE WE'RE BASED IN BERKELEY. YEAH BOY. A STAFF OF ABOUT TWENTY AND OUR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE A LEGAL AT THAT. LIVE IT UP. AND SO I AM HERE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN YOU JUST. AT THE KNOWS. SO START BY TALKING ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE MY. YES MY. SO I'M DONE SPECTER I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON LAW OFFICE SO I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE ISSUES WE SEE FACING CORRECTIONS AND THE BASE MOST BASIC VIEW ISSUE FACING CORRECTIONS IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AT IN ITS PRISONS WE HAVE A PRISON SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND AS YOU JUST HEARD THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. THAT WE BROUGHT A CASE MANY YEARS AGO THAT WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT CAP PRISON POPULATION AT A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF ITS DESIGN PASSIVITY AN- APARTMENT HAS THROUGH. INITIATIVES IN SOME LEGISLATION BEEN ABLE TO MEET THAT CAP. BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. TO PANEL AND YOU WILL MANY OF WHOM. PROBABLY KNOW THIS BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PRISONS WHO WERE WITH WHICH YOU'RE WAY OVER THAT DESIGN CAPACITY. THERE ARE TEN PERSONS WHICH YOU'RE OVER THE COURT ORDERED CAP NOT. THE CAP WAS DESIGNED FOR THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE SO THAT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THEY'RE NOT VIOLATING A COURT ORDER. JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE. PRISONS ARE OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5% FOR PRISONS ARE OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY PERCENT. AND THE HIGHEST PRISON IS AT A HUNDRED AND 73% OF DESIGN CAPACITY THAT'S THE- PRISON AT SOLANO. IN MY OPINION UNTIL THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT GETS A HANDLE ON ON REDUCING THE- UP PRISON POPULATION. MANY OF THE EFFORTS THAT KATHY WANTS TO SUCCEED AND WE HAVE TO LITIGATE. YEAH. TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS WHAT WON'T GET FIXED THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY PEOPLE CONFINED IN SMALL SPACES AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES NECESSARY TO NOT ONLY KEEP THEM SAFE PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING SICK OR DYING BUT ALSO YOU IT'S REALLY HARD TO REHABILITATE SOMEBODY IN AN INSTITUTION WHICH IS NOT SAFE AND WHICH IS NOT PROVIDING THE PROCREATE SERVICES AND YOU IT'S REALLY HARD TO REHABILITATE SOMEBODY IN SUCH MASSIVE PRISON. IS THERE AN I. T. PERSON IN THE HOUSE OKAY VERY GO. SO OVER IT I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT'S- YOU KNOW MY IF THERE IS GOING TO BE IN AN EFFORT TO REFORM THE PRISON SYSTEM MY ENERGIES WOULD BE ON REDUCING THE POPULATION BECAUSE THAT THAT INHIBITS EVERYTHING FROM THAT KATHY WAS TRYING TO DO FROM. FROM BECOMING A REALITY AND I WANT TO TALK TO AN- A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OUR CASE THAT INVOLVED THE FAILURE OF THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE MENTALLY ILL SERVICES AND HOW THAT INTO RELATES WITH THE PRISON CAP THE SERVER SIDE RATE AS YOU MIGHT HAVE READ IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE ARTICLE JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. IS THAT A HISTORICALLY HIGH RATES RALPH THE AS THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS MENTIONED THAT IT'S A SUICIDE CRISIS IT'S A TWENTY SIX POINT THREE PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED AND THOUSANDS. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON THAT'S ABOUT THE HIGHEST AMONG MANY PRISON POPULOUS PRESENTS LARGE PRISON SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY. AND IT'S HAPPENING DESPITE THE OVER TWENTY YEARS OF LITIGATION. OVER EFFORTS TO IMPROVE A SUICIDE QUESTIONS AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE MENTALLY ILL POPULATION THE POPULATION. SINCE WE REDUCE THE POPULATION FROM A HIGH OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS BUT NOT WITHOUT HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND. PEOPLE IN PRISON WHEN WE FILED THE OVERCROWDING CASE TO WHAT IT IS NOW THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MORE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM THAN THERE WERE WHEN WE STARTED THAT CASE. AND A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN PRISON AS- A AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU KNOW AS OF AUGUST OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT OR 29% OF THE PRISON POPULATION HAD A MEN ONLY MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSIS. SO WE ARE REALLY TURNING THAT DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS INTO TWO INTO A PLACE WHICH HOUSES PEOPLE WITH LIFE SENTENCES AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AND AS A RESULT PEOPLE ARE GETTING TREATMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DESPITE ITS- EFFORTS WHICH I DON'T THINK HAVE BEEN AS ALICE'S THEY COULD BE. FIND ENOUGH. PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHIATRISTS TO TREAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY HAVE AN MENTAL ILLNESS SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SYSTEMIC REFORMS I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RATE AT WHICH WE INCARCERATE PEOPLE WITH MENTALLY ILL AND PROVIDE COMMUNITY GRAMS WHICH ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND MUCH CHEAPER THAN SENDING. A PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS TO PRISON. THE OTHER. SYSTEM WIDE. PROBLEM THAT'S FACING CORRECTIONS IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS IN THE PRISONS IT WOULD IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE PUT SOME OF THE PRISONS ARE LITERALLY FALLING APART THERE ARE HOLES IN THE ROOFS OF WINGS OF PRISONS HOUSING UNITS OF PRISONS HAVE TO BE REPLACED CAPTIONS HAVE TO BE REPLACED IF YOU GO TO THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN YOU'LL SEE A THIRD WORLD PLUMBING SYSTEM. AND WELL HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN OVER CROWDED SO WHAT IS WHAT WAS DESIGNED FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE IT'S BEEN IT'S LIKE IF YOU LIVED IN YOUR HOUSE AND YOU'RE INVITED TEN PEOPLE TO SHARE A FOR. A FOUR PERSON HOUSE. ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT THAT HOUSE HAS TO OPERATE WOULD DETERIORATE FASTER AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE OF OVERCROWDING. SO TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW. EXPENSIVE THIS IS AND HOW. THE BASE OF IT IS THE DEPARTMENT TO ITS AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ITS CREDIT IT INITIATED THE STUDY BY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WHO BUILT MANY OF THE PRISONS TO DETERMINE WHAT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. AND THEY LOOKED AT THE CALIFORNIA MEN'S FACILITY IT BACK TO BILL AND THEY FOUND THAT. IT WILL COST SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO BRING THAT UP. PRISON UP TO STANDARDS AND THAT WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO REPLACE A SEVERAL HOUSING UNITS HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER LAYS A BUNCH OF OTHER HOUSING UNITS. HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO REPLACE A BUNCH OF OTHER HOUSING UNITS AND THAT'S NOT COUNTING THE KITCHEN AND ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE THAT IS HOVERING OVER THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT THERE THESE FACILITIES ESSENTIALLY ARE NOT SAFE AND- TO BRING THAT. POINT HOME. WE LITIGATED A CASE AT THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY IN CORCORAN OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THAT OF. YEAH CAT THESE ALMA MATER. AND THE REASON WE LITIGATED THE CASES BECAUSE A PRISONER WROTE TO US AND SAID EATING IN THE DINING HALL WHERE THERE'S A HOLE IN THE ROOF AND AS YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA IT RAINS. AND SO THE RAIN WOULD COME AND BECAUSE WELL THE ROOF IS FAILING AND THE RAIN WOULD WELL I READ YOU WHAT THE COURT SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT. TWO PRISONERS WHO ARE EATING AT IN THAT DINING HALL. IT'S A SHAME THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION HAVE A LOT OF THE FIST THE EIGHT DOT ALL. ALL IN SUCH A STATE OF DISREPAIR. THE EVIDENCE PAINTS A PICTURE OF A CORRECTIONAL DINING BILL THE LONG NEGLECTED OF BASIC HOUSING MAINTENANCE THAT IS NOW IRRECONCILABLE WITH LOOKING XIN. IN THE NATION AND OF SUCH FINANCIAL UPON. THE BILL HAS. THE EXPERT WE HIRED IN THAT CASE EXAMINE THE ROOF HE'S HE'S EXAMINED THE THOUSAND ROOFS AND FOUND THAT WAS THE WORST HE'S EVER SEEN HE TESTIFIED THAT THE ROOFING FAILURES CREATE QUOTE A PATHWAY OF RAIN WATER MAKES PC'S THAT FLOWS DOWNWARD IN THE ARCHITECTURAL SYSTEMS AND INTO THE DINING ROOM. BELOW. HE ALL AND THE COURT FOUND THAT CEILING TILES SATURATED WITH THIS WATER POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF FALLING ON INMATES. CAUSING THEM EITHER PHYSICAL INJURY FROM THE IMPACT OF PLACING THEM IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH FECAL MATTER AND MOLD ON A SEPARATE OCCASION AMOUNTS FELL INTO THE DINING ROOM TABLE FROM THE CEILING. AND EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT RAINING THE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHES THAT INMATES ARE SEATED AT TABLES UNDER EXPOSED CEILING FROM WHICH MICE AND MAGGOTS FALL DURING MEAL TIME. AND THE TOP ALL THAT OFF THIS IS A CASE THAT WENT TO LITIGATION THE DEPARTMENT KNEW ABOUT IT WE REYES. IT WAS A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT THIS CASE FILE THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL TO GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED. THEY GRANTED HIS APPEAL BUT THE PROBLEM AND WE HAVE A LITIGATE THIS AND IT TOOK ACTUALLY EVEN AFTER WE WON. THE CASE IN THE COURT IT TOOK THE PERSONAL INTERVENTION OF SECRETARY DS THAT WE CLOSE THE DINING HALL UNTIL THE. PROBLEM WAS CORRECTED SO. IN CONCLUSION. POPULATION ISSUES INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES AND THE NUMBER OF MENTALLY ILL WHO WERE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM ARE THE ISSUES THAT I HOPE. YOU ALL AND THE LEGISLATURE IN FRONT OF THE COMING YEAR. YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GOING TO BE WORKING FROM A HAND OUT CALLED PLANNING FOR THE DECLINING INMATE POPULATION FOR MY REMARKS ON BOTH PANEL ONE IN PANEL TO WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE MAYBE EXTRA COPIES IF ANYONE NEEDS ONE. AND I'M GOING TO FIRST PRESENTS PROJECTIONS OF WHERE THEY MAY POPULATION IS THAT IT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ADD PROVIDE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE COURT ORDERED LIMITS ON PRISON OVERCROWDING AS WELL AS DISCUSSED SOME APPROACHES THAT THE STATE COULD TAKE TO REDUCE CAPACITY AS- POPULATION DECLINE. WHICH IS A LITTLE FOR YOUR NEXT PAGE. ONE YOU SEE IF YOU CAN SEE THE- ON ON PAGE ONE SHOWS THAT THE STATE INMATE POPULATION THE OVERALL IN THE POPULATION IS PRETTY. ACTED TO DECLINE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. SPECIFICALLY BY AN ESTIMATED SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED INMATES BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND IF THE CLIENT MERRILY AHEAD DUE TO THE IMPACT OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND I MADE CERTAIN NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS AUTHORIZED AND OR EXPANDED CDC ARE THE THIRTY TO REDUCE INMATES TERMS THEIR CREDITS. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THESE PROJECTIONS YOU SEE IN THE FIGURE HERE REFLECT ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE MADE TO THE MINISTRY MOST RECENT POPULATION PROJECTIONS. ACCOUNT FOR THEM OUR MOST RECENT MONTHS OF ACTUAL DATA AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF SOME MILLION ACTED SENSING CHANGES. TURN THE PAGE TO PAGE TWO AND I'M GOING TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE FEDERAL COURT ORDERED PRISON POPULATION CAP. MORE SPECIFICALLY CDC ARE IS REQUIRED TO LIMIT PRISON OVERCROWDING BY KEEPING THE POPULATION OF ITS THIRTY FOUR STATE OWN PRISONS TO UNDER ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND INMATES. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE DOESN'T EXCEED THAT CAP CDC ARE MAINTAINS A POPULATION TYPICALLY OF A COUPLE THOUSAND INMATES LESS THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. AND IN THE THIRTY FOUR PRESENCE IN ORDER TO BUFFER AGAINST UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN THE POPULATION AND AVOID TO AVOID EXCEEDING THAT THE COURT ORDER. AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT INMATES THAT THE STATE DOES HOUSE IN MADE OUTSIDE OF THE THIRTY FOUR STATE OWNED AND OPERATED PRISONS TO AVOID EXCEEDING THE CAP BECAUSE THE OVERALL POPULATION IS HIGHER THAN THAT CURRENTLY HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. SO AND AS OF OCTOBER NINTH CDC OUR HOUSE ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED MALE INMATES AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FEMALE INMATES AND PRIVATE PRIVATELY OPERATED CONTRACT FACILITIES. AND ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MALE INMATES IN PUBLICLY OPERATED CONTRACT FACILITIES AND ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN HUNDRED INMATES IN VARIOUS OTHER PLACEMENT. INCLUDING CONSERVATION CAMPS. MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE. I'M GOING TO DISCUSS SOME APPROACHES FOR ACCOMMODATING THE PROJECTED DECLINE IN THE INMATE POPULATION. EXISTING STATE LAW REQUIRES CDC OUR FIRST TO REMOVE ALL IN ME ALL MALE INMATES FROM PRIVATELY OPERATED CONTRACT PRISONS WHICH IS IN PROCESS THE STATE DID REMOVE INMATES FROM ONE OF THREE OF THOSE FACILITIES LAST MONTH AS AS A POPULATION. HAS BEEN DECLINING. STATE LAW THEN ARTHRITIS CDC ARE TO DETERMINE HOW TO ACCOMMODATE FURTHER DECLINES IN THE POPULATION BUT REQUIRES CDC ARE TO CONSIDER CERTAIN CRITERIA SUCH AS COST AS WELL AS GENDER SPECIFIC HOUSING NEEDS. AND REGARDING BOYS ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE CAPACITY IN LINE WITH THE PROJECTED DECLINES OF IN THE PRISON POPULATION. WE THINK THAT CLOSING STATE OPERATED PRISONS WOULD LIKELY ALLOW FOR THE GREATEST SAVINGS. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OF COURSE OTHER CRITERIA THAT SHOULD SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND SO ON THAT POINT AND AFTER. THE STATE REMOVES THE ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED INMATES FROM THE MAIL PRIVATE PRIVATELY OPERATED CONTACT AS HOUSING MALES AS IS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW. AND THE PROJECTIONS SUGGEST THAT THERE WILL BE A REMAINING REDUCTION OF ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED INMATES BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT WILL STILL NEED TO BE ACCOMMODATED. AND SO THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS THAT THIS COULD BE IT THIS REDUCTION COULD BE ACCOMMODATED. AND THE THREE THREE WAYS THREE MAIN WAYS AND ARE WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY THE FIRST IS TO CLOSE THEY OPERATED PRISONS AND WITH THAT A ROUGHLY FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND MEET DECLINE THE STATE COULD CLOSE BOTH THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED. PRESENT AT AND WHICH WE ESTIMATE WOULD YIELD ROUGHLY A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SAVINGS. I'M AN ADDITION WHEN A PRISON IS BOTH THE PENDING ON THE PRESIDENT THEY COULD ALSO. TO AVOID COSTLY INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NECESSARY TO CONTINUE OP THE PRESENT. THE SECOND APPROACH WOULD BE TO PUT A PRIORITIZE ELIMINATING THE REMAIN CONTRACT BEDS. AND SO AS I MENTIONED AFTER THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOUSING MALES AND PRIVATELY OPERATED FACILITIES ARE REMOVED THERE'S WOULD STILL BE OUT TO HUNT TWO THOUSAND INMATES LEFT IN CONTRACT FACILITIES. AND SO IF THE STATE CHOSE TO REMOVE INMATES FROM THOSE FACILITIES. IT WHAT WE ESTIMATE THAT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION DECLINE IT COULD STILL CLOSE AND MEDIUM SIZED PRISON. IN DOING SO DOING THESE TWO ACTIONS TOGETHER WE ESTIMATE WOULD SAVE AROUND A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND FINALLY THE THIRD APPROACH THAT I WILL MENTION HERE TODAY WOULD BE SIMPLY TO ALLOW THE POPULATION OF TO MAINTAIN CONTRACTS MEAN TEEN OPERATION OF ALL THE PRISONS BUT JUST ALLOW THE POPULATION OF THE- F. THIRTY FOUR STATE OWNED AND OPERATED PRISONS. TO DECLINE AS THE INMATE POPULATION DECLINES IN OTHER WORDS OPERATING PRISONS LESS DENSELY AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THAT APPROACH WOULD YIELD TOTAL OPERATIONAL SAVINGS ON IN THE SEVERAL TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND I WILL RETURN TO THE HAND OUT FOR PANEL. OVER TO HOLD MY COMMENTS THERE AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT SO I USED TO BE DIRECTOR WILL STAY SO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS. CUT ABOVE MY THING AND I KNOW AND PUBLIC SECTOR WE DON'T DO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OVERALL NOT JUST CDC ARE AND YOU'RE MENTIONING SOME. RENT IS THINGS ARE GOING ON AND I IN A WAY TO ONE. OTHER FACILITIES WHERE THEY HAVE NO AIR CONDITIONING AND IT CAN GET UPWARDS TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DEGREES OUTSIDE AND PART OF IT YOU RAISED A LOT OF THE INFORMATION FROM THE TRACK. QUAL DURING THE DAY AND THEN THEY GO TO SLEEP. AT NIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN CRAWL BUT IT'S A AND HAVE SWAMPED BANDS AND THINGS THAT NATURE BUT NO ONE'S EVER REALLY ADDRESSING MAYBE JUST GET SOME AIR CONDITIONING. BUT IT'S ALSO VERY COST PROHIBITIVE. SO. YOUR YOUR NAME AND ALL THAT ARE YOU KIND OF SAME WE SHOULD GO AND MAYBE GO TO PUBLIC AND GET A BOND AND TRY TO REBUILD A READ AND OFF THE FINANCES OVER SQUIRMING RIGHT NOW BUT EACH WEEK SO WE THINK ABOUT A COUPLE OF BONDING PROGRAM TO. REHABILITATE OUR BUILDING SO THAT THEY FIT IN LINE WITH THE NEW REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT WERE DESIGNING. SO THAT NOT BE. REFERS TO BUILD AND BRING THEM UP TO STANDARD BUT WE DESIGNED A MAST SIDE SO THAT THEY- KIND OF THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR ANY OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO. YEAH I DON'T REALLY CARE WHERE YOU GET THE MONEY. I'M NOT A MONEY ISSUE YEAH I KNOW I KNOW BUT YEAH IT'S- IS NOT ONLY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING BUT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS IT MAKES PEOPLE SICK AND IT'S A MATTER OF ACTUAL. YOU KNOW. WILL SAVE A AND FREE FROM DISEASE. AND SO YES I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR JUST ONE PRISON. HONEY BUT IT'S REAL MONEY AND IT'S GOING TO COST A LOT OF AND THEY WILL LET MORE THAT THEY'VE STUDIED AND WE'RE WAITING FOR THOSE REPORTS TO COME OUT AND I GUESS IS THE RELATIVELY SIMILAR. AND SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT I DON'T MY MATHIS BET THAT'S WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT MONEY GUY BUT YOU'RE LOOKING A LOT OF MONEY IN ORDER TO DO THIS SO. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO PRIORITIZE THE THING THAT I DID. THE REAL ESTATE AND THE PROPERTIES WHICH ARE AT THEM BECAUSE THE MOST HARTMAN THERE ARE. PUT IT YES BOTH END UP YOUR INCARCERATED TO FIX THOSE IN THAT SOME SOMEWHAT OF ON SOMEWHAT OF A QUICK SCHEDULE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO PLAN AT ALL. THANK YOU WEBER SO QUICK QUESTION TO ALL THREE PANELISTS I THINK THE UNDERSECRETARY. DESCRIBED A- SOME OF THE REHABILITATION OPTIONS I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO REALLY ENSURE THE POPULATION GOES DOWN BE ABILITY ASIANS GRANT TO BE DONE BETTER PROBABLY MORE STRATEGICALLY AND WITH CLEAR RESULTS SUGGEST FOR REQUESTED UNDERSECRETARY BUT LOVE THE COMMENTS FROM LA AS WELL AS- WHICH IS BETTER IS. I'M NOT NOTHING YOU HAVE. THE CLASSES IN PLACE IN THE FUTURE I KNOW THE SNAPPING DONE YET IN THE FUTURE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EVALUATE SUCCESS MANAGEMENT IN MAY IN MAY PERSPECTIVE HOW WILL YOU KNOW. BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE L. L. IN MISTER SPECTER COULD TURN IN THE PAPER TO. WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF INITIATIVE SO. REHABILITATION IS YOU KNOW WAS WAS ONE OF OUR KEY. KEY MISSIONS OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND SO FOCUSING THOSE ENERGIES REAR THE PROCESS OF REEVALUATING THE MODEL ON HOW WE- HOW EDUCATION IS DELIVERED AND WHAT TIME FRAMES TO MAXIMIZE UTILIZATION OF THE CLASSROOM SPACE AS WELL AS A VERY STREET IN SPACES THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED WITH OUR FURTHER EXPANSION OF OUR- INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT MODEL THAT IS GET READY TO ROLL OUT IN JANUARY. OF WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ON THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH AS WELL AS THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE WE'VE SIGNED SOME AGREEMENTS WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO BE ABLE TO TRACK OUTCOMES. IN IN SOME WAYS TO SEE. OUR OFFENDERS ABLE TO GET REAL JOBS RIGHT REAL JOBS IN TRADES REAL JOBS YOU KNOW WE I KNOW WE'RE FOCUSING ON THESE THE FIRE GUYS THAT ARE GOING OUT SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE THERE AND EXACT. HELLO I'M NOT THE PROJECT FOR. WHO'S JUST SO WE KNOW WE KNOW WHO'S IN. CHARGE OF DEVELOPING THAT TRACKING IN THAT MEASUREMENT. SO IT VARIES PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT PIECES SO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE PRISON TO IMPLEMENT HAVE THEIR PEACE FOR VERY SPECIFIC TRADES. FOR LIKE THE WHAT A WELDING TRADER CARPENTER TRAITS OF THOSE TYPE OF THINGS I KNOW DEAR PEAS WORKING ON SOME INITIATIVES AND MISTRESSES AGAIN SPEAK TO THAT AND THEN OF COURSE OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH IS PARTNERING UP TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY. GOING FORWARD. WHAT THE WHAT HOW HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE GOAL WHAT WITH THE GOAL OF THE OF THOSE VARIOUS INITIATIVES. THESE ARE MY WORDS SO. IT'S. I WOULD THINK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE BASS TO GIVE US THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK MEANING AND ALL USE ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNDERWATER WELDING THIS GUY'S OF THE CORD TO PA HAS RECIDIVISM. OUR CODING PROGRAM. LOW IF ANY WERE SERVICE AT RIGHT RATE SO THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS. TO FOUR PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY BE SUCCESSFUL. YEAH. UHHUH. YEAH SURE. UHHUH OUR. THAT'S FAIR I MEAN INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITS. THIS IS OUR NUMBER ONE CHALLENGE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. PHYSICAL PLANT AS FAR AS WHAT INSTITUTIONS ARE BUILT WITH WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMMING SPACE AND IT ALL OFTENTIMES HAS TO DO WITH THE TIME THAT THEY'RE BUILT RIGHT CTF FOR EXAMPLE OR CALIFORNIA TRADE FACILITY IT WAS BUILT AT A TIME. WHERE REHABILITATION WAS PART OF THE GAME THEY HAVE LOTS OF PROGRAM SPACE I WOULD ALSO PRESENT LOTS OF PROGRAM SPACE SO IT JUST REALLY KIND OF DEPENDS UPON EACH INSTITUTION I WISH I COULD TAKE FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY WELDING I WISH I COULD HAVE EVER CIVIL PRISON. AND EVERY SINGLE YARD I MIGHT HAVE A ONE YOUR BUT NOT ANOTHER YARD SO I MEAN WE DO HAVE A CHALLENGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FAIR NEXT LITTLE PROGRAMS RATHER INSTITUTIONS. THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I VISITED SALINAS VALLEY JUST A FEW TO GO NUTS WILL BE. WE NOTICE RIGHT YOU'RE AT. A FIVE A PRETTY AMAZING WELDING PROGRAM ONE YARD. BUT THE OTHER THREE YARDS COULDN'T. ACCESS THAT PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH IS JUST A FEW. FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE- LEVERAGE THAT AMAZING RESOURCES READY AT THE FACILITY. HOUSE ACCESS TO. HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS NOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. MAXIMIZE UTILIZATION THE SPACE THE PROGRAM. WELL THERE ARE TWO SIMPLE ANSWERS PROBABLY WHICH YOU KNOW OUR ANYONE IS A USE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS ONLY OR TWO IF YOU'RE GONNA USE NON EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THEY SHOULD COME WITH THEY SHOULD BE CUT PAIRED WITH MONEY TO ALLOW THEM TO BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT AND THE THIRD THING WHICH OF OFTEN IS THE HARDEST IS TO GET RID OF THE PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT. THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. GEN OF JUVENILE JUSTICE HAS COME A LONG WAY IN DOING THAT THEY SO I KNOW IT CAN BE DONE AS TO YOUR- COMMENT ABOUT SCALE. YEAH THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE UNDER WATER WELDERS OR HOW MANY FISH. YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TRAIN ON OUR WELDERS ARE THEY HAVE A HORSE PROGRAM AND SEE I AM. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IN A SEA OF. PEOPLE HUNDRED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SO. I THINK. YOU KNOW IF I WERE. IN CHECKING AS SOMEBODY. HE SAID. I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY DO OFFER OFFER THEM TO THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE AVAILABLE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT. THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT CRITERIA HAS BEEN IN EFFECT OR NOT. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE CONTRACT WITH EXTERNAL RESEARCHERS TO CONDUCT COST EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES OF CDC OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND MY COLLEAGUE PLANS TO DESCRIBE THAT. ON THE THIRD PANEL. YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SUSPECT I'M SURE YOU WHERE WE HAVE WE LOOK INTO THE ISSUE OF. OBVIOUSLY MAINTENANCE REPAIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OUR PRISONS WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IN PICTURES AS WELL AS A HUGE LEAKS AND- WROTE SOME THINGS THAT ARE FALLING APART. ONE OF THINGS WERE GRAPPLING WITH AND I GUESS IT SHOULD COME MAY COME FROM CDC OURS THAT WE ARE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE DECLINE IN THE POPULATION AND WE HOPE TO. QUESTION BECOMES ONCE IF WE'RE DECLINE. WE ARE HAPPY TO BE AND I WANT TO BE THEN HOW DO WE PLAN AND MANAGE THE POPULATIONS REMAINS SO WHO CAN GET TO A POINT. IN A PRISON. TO PRE INTEGRATE X. AMOUNT OF SAVINGS. THE ONE THING WE FEAR IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PUT. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO REPAIRING A PRISON THAT WE TEAR DOWN THE NEXT DAY. SO THAT'S THAT'S A REAL CONCERN AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE PRIORITY LIST. OF IF WE REDUCE THE POPULATION WHAT. SHOULD WE KEEP AND THAT'S A HOT POLITICAL ISSUE CAUSES IT SOME PEOPLE'S AREAS AND MAYBE LIKE PRISONS BECAUSE IT CREATES JOBS. SO WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE DEFINE WHAT PRISON IS GOING TO COME DOWN. IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY BECAUSE AS LONG AS THAT EXIST IT'S GOING TO COST AS ANY TO MAINTAIN IT. AND WE INVEST A LOT OF MONEY INTO REPAIRS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO YEAR ROUND. OF THAT BECOMES OF THE PUBLIC OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE. OUTRAGED AT THE FACT WE WOULD DO THAT SO IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ALL THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EASE. OF AS WE. LOOK AT THE- PLACE TO DECLINING. OF GOLD. TRY TO WE TRIED TO MAN IS THE POPULATION THAT YOU KNOW MANAGE THE PRISONS THAT ARE THERE AND I THINK OF MISTER KING INDICATED EARLIER IN ONE OF THE REVIEWS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THE PRICE KEEPS ONE UP BECAUSE NOW WE'VE GOT THE SAME OUTLET THAT THE SAME BUT THE ISSUE THAT THAT WOULD PUTTING OUT WITH A FEW PEOPLE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WE SPENDING MORE MONEY PRISONER OF RIGHT NOW THAN WE WERE WHEN WE HAD A SMALL POPULATION. SOME OF IT IS BECAUSE OF DESTRUCTION WOULD HAVE SOME OF THIS BECAUSE WOULD DO MORE PROGRAMMING BUT BUT THE REAL SAVINGS WILL COME HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT START SHUTTING DOWN EXPRESSIONS THEN I THINK IT BECOMES IT MAKES SENSE TO DO THE REPAIRS WE HAVE TO DO BUT TO. YOU KNOW. WHAT WAS HOME OF A- MILITARY BASE HERE. AND IT IS BUILD A NEW HOSPITAL NEW A PERFORMING ARTS CENTER. AND A COUPLE OF THE NEW THINGS. AND IN THE FIFTH SET IT DOWN. SO WE HAD. TO FORMING ARTS AND IS A NOBODY EVER PERFORMED IN. THAT HOSPITAL NEVER HAD A BIT IN IT THAT ANYBODY EVER LAID AND- AND YET THEY SAID SO THE DOWN BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO PUT. THEM CRD THAT SHOULD DOWN I THINK IT WAS AND SO AS A RESULT. WHEN WE WITH THIS GREAT FACILITIES IF IT JUST BILL. AND I AND I KNOW SOMETIMES I CAN'T BE HELD BECAUSE HOW LONG TO GET FROM THE BILL. BUT OUR CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE THAT. OF WE KNOW THE REHABILITATION SAM TRYING NEW THINGS WE HAVE TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. BUT IF WE WANT TO CLOSE A PRISON DO WE WANT TO RENOVATE IT FOR. OKAY AND I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO DO THAT SO. THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO RESPOND TO BUT THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF. HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE THE NUMBER PRISONS AND THE OTHER THING THAT. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR THIS PANEL WE HAVE PANEL NUMBER TWO COMING UP. IT DOES YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. NUMBER ONE HOLD WEALTHY HOLD THEM. WE HAVE OUR STREETS STRATEGIES FOR POPULATION MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE MATTHEW KATE THE TASHA. MINSKER AND CAITLIN O'NEILL. ON THIS PANEL. THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH THE SPECTER. WHEN OF CORRECTIONS YEAH. YEAH. THE SERVER HERE YEAH OKAY. YEAH YEAH YEAH. THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO THIS WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO FOLLOW ONCE AGAIN IN THE ORDER THAT YOUR IN TO TALK WITH STRATEGIES FOR POPULATION MANAGEMENT. OF WELL I THINK WE HAD. THE CORRECTIONS GOING FOR. FOLLOWED BY THE LA FOLLOWED BY THE SECRETARY OF C. C. R. AND FOLLOWED BY THE ARMY YEAH. FORMER ALIGHTED IN YOUR INTRO MA'AM. WE COME ALONG WITH A HEART PATIENT AND HAS DRASTICALLY DECREASED OVER THE YEARS THAT ARE ALL TIME HIGH OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND NOW WERE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR TO BE PRECISE AS OF MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT THAT DINGS EVERY MIDNIGHT FOR ME AND- UNFORTUNATELY. I'M STILL AWAKE MORE TIMES I HEAR. HAS A POPULATION. MY SPONSOR. SORRY OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS HAVE REALLY SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE. CAITLYN IN HELL WITH HERS SO IN TWO THOUSAND AN ELEVEN. REALIGNMENT HAPPENED AND THAT STOPPED THE INFLUX OF NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS INTO OUR SYSTEM. THAT MADE A DRASTIC DIFFERENCE IN OUR POPULATION. FOLLOWED BUT PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX WAS THE THIRD STRIKERS MONSTERS NONVIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED OF THOSE WITH TWENTY SIX HUNDRED OF THOSE HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED STILL HAVE A FEW REMAINING PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN STOP THE WHAT WE CALL THE WATER OFFENSES THERE WAS A MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY. AND NOT DEPEND UPON. THE WALL WHO ARE PART OF THAT AWAY AND MADE MINIMAL MISDEMEANOR SO THAT REALLY DRASTICALLY. REDUCED WHAT WAS COMING IN THE FRONT FRONT DOOR FOR MINOR PETTY THEFT CRIMES OR- APPLE DRUG POSSESSION. FOLLOWED BY OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE IS PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WAS VOTED BY THE VOTERS THAT SAID OKAY WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A TIME WHERE POPULATION IS SO HIGH LET'S DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS A FULL REFORM NO BUT WHAT IT IS IT GIVES IT OFFENDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK OFF TIME OFF THEIR SENTENCE. SO INDIVIDUALS GOING TO MAKE A DECISION PROGRAM AND GET CREDITS REDUCE REALLY SUBSTANTIAL CREDIT SO FOR A GED HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA COLLEGE YOU CAN GET A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. YOU CAN GET TWELVE WEEKS OFF A YEAR. THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND WE'VE SEEN A DRASTIC DECREASE IN OUR IN OUR POPULATION BECAUSE OF IT. IN ADDITION TO FIFTY SEVEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OF BUILT WHAT WE CALL THE ELEVEN SEVENTY DO YOU RECALL OF SENTENCE THAT IS REALLY BAD AND SIGNIFICANT FOR US AND WE'VE HAD PRETTY GOOD RESPONSE FROM THE COUNTIES SO WE'RE ABLE TO SEND OFFENDERS BACK FOR RESET AND SEEN THANKS TO SOME LAW CHANGES THAT. OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S ADMINISTRATION AS IT RELATES TO ENHANCEMENTS SO YOU CAN HAVE A CORE OFFENSE OF LET'S SAY IT'S FOR FOUR YEARS. YOU CAN HAVE AN EXPENSE OF TEN. AND SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND OFFENDERS BACK BASED ON GOOD CONDUCT. BACK TO THE COURTS FOR RE SENTENCING AND LIKE I SAID WE'VE SEEN SOME PRETTY GOOD SUCCESS WITH THAT. AND IS IT IS YOU GUYS KNOW THE LIFE FOR POPULATION HAS REDUCED. PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY WE'VE HAD OVER FIVE THOUSAND LIFERS RECEIVE DATES. OVER THE LAST YOU KNOW EIGHT NINE YEARS A TREND THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE AND SO THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT WHAT THAT DOES IS THE FOR THE POPULATION HOPE. THAT YES I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE CAN GET I CAN GET OUT AND BE SUCCESSFUL. AS WELL AS YOU KNOW I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD ABOUT COMMUTATIONS THE GOVERNOR HAS ABILITY. TO DO COMMUTATIONS. EVEN LIFE WITHOUT AND SO SEE IN THOSE CHANGES AND HAVING PEOPLE BE ABLE TO. GET RELEASE TO GET A SECOND CHANCE HE'S REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE TO KEEP OUR INSTITUTIONS SAY. I'M TRYING TO THE HANDOUT THAT I WAS SPEAKING FROM EARLIER CALLED PLANNING FOR THE CLEANING IN MY PROPOSITION I'M I'M GOING TO START ON PAGE FOUR. AND ONE AND DISCUSS ACTION BUT THE STATE COULD TAKE IF IT WANTED TO ACCELERATE THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND OR PRISON CLOSURE BEYOND WHAT WOULD BE ALLOW WHAT WHAT WOULD BE DOABLE JUST. AS THE POPULATION DECLINES NATURALLY. SERVICE THOSE OPTIONS FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES. THE FIRST WOULD BE TWO AND WILL BE A SET OF ACTIONS THAT OPTIONS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL INMATE POPULATION. AND FOR EXAMPLE ADD TO IT THAT BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS COULD INITIATE RELEASE CONSIDERATION FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS SIXTY DAYS EARLIER THAN THEY DO NOW WHICH WOULD EXPEDITE RELEASES AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED. AT THE STATE COULD EXPAND ACCESS TO MINIMUM CUSTODY PLACEMENTS ALLOWING SOME INMATES TO EARN MORE CREDITS. WE HAVE ALSO PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED THIS. IN ADDITION THE STATE COULD ENACT SENTENCING CHANGES ISN'T ENCOMPASSES A WIDE VARIETY OF POSSIBILITIES FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE COULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR THE ELDERLY OR YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE PROCESS SEAT. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER A WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF OPTIONS AS FAR AS AND IT'S EASY ARE CAN PURSUE TO USING ITS AUTHORITY TO INCREASE IN MAKE CREDITS AS WELL AS RECOMMENDING INMATES TO THE COURTS FOR RE SENTENCING UNDER THAT ELEVEN SEVENTY D. PROCESS. THE THIRD EXCUSE ME THE SECOND CATEGORY OF OPTIONS WAY TO YES THE ACTIONS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INMATES IN PLACEMENTS. THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE THIRTY FOUR PRISONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE COURT ORDERED POPULATION CAP. SUCH AS CONSERVATION CAMPS SO FOR EXAMPLE AND THE STATE COULD INCREASE THE CAN'T CONSERVATION CAMP POPULATION BY EXPANDING IN MADE ELIGIBILITY FOR CAMPS OR INCREASING INCENTIVES FOR INMATES TO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN CAMPS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED. IN ADDITION THE STATE COULD ALLOW MORE INMATES TO SERVE THE LAST PORTION OF THEIR SENTENCE IN THE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM. AND THEN TURNING THE PAGE TO PAGE FIVE. THE THIRD A CATEGORY OF OPTIONS WOULD BE TO ESSENTIALLY OPERATE THE THIRTY FOUR PRISONS WITH A SMALLER BUFFER WHICH IS SOMETHING I MENTIONED ON PANEL ONE AND- AT THAT THE STATE IS ALLOWED TO HOUSE UP TO A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND INMATES IN ITS- THIRTY FOUR PRESENCE. BUT CHOOSES THE HOUSE ABOUT ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BUFFER IN CASE THERE'S AN UNEXPECTED INCREASE. SO THIS OPTION WOULD JUST INVOLVE HOUSING HERE IN ME AN EXCUSE ME HOUSING MORE INMATES IN STATE OWNED AND OPERATED PRISONS AND THEREFORE OPERATING A SMALLER BUFFER. AND THE STATE CHOSE THIS OPTION IT MAY WANT TO TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE INCREASED RISK OF VIOLATING A COURT ORDER. YES SOME OF NEXT GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MATT KATE I WAS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE PRISON SYSTEM FROM 200-042-2000 EIGHT AND THE SECRETARY FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO THE END OF. TWENTY TWELVE. I'M CURRENTLY IN PRIVATE SECTOR. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE BUILT THE WRONG PRISONS BUT EVERYONE DID RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I AM VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PLUS VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. I'M AN EXCELLENT DESIGN FOR PREVENTING ESCAPES A VERY POOR DESIGN FOR. OUR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. THE SITE THE SOUND THE SMILE THE TEMPERATURE ALL POORLY DESIGNED FOR PROVIDING A THERAPEUTIC MILIEU. AND SO WHAT DO YOU DO THEY'RE TOO EXPENSIVE TO TEAR DOWN AND TOO EXPENSIVE TO REBUILD. THE ANSWER FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS REDUCING POPULATION THROUGH REDUCING RECIDIVISM. 300-003-8000 INMATES ARE RELEASED EVERY YEAR INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IF YOU CAN REDUCE RECIDIVISM BY 10% THAT'S ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND INMATES A YEAR. RIGHT AND THAT NUMBER DECLINES EACH YEAR AND SO ON. HOW DO YOU DO THAT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK. CURRENT THERE'S CURRENTLY AN INVITATION FOR BED OUT THAT IS GOING TO EXPAND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN THE PRISONS IMPROVE THEM AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE WEBSITE AND ALSO OFFICE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE SECRET SAUCE IS TO COMBINE THOSE IN PRISON PROGRAMS WITH EFFECTIVE AFTER CARE AND RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. SINCE LEAVING THE DEPARTMENT I JOIN THE BOARD OF THE ENTIRE CITIZEN COALITION AND LOS ANGELES ALSO. HAVE TAKEN ON AS CLIENTS A COUPLE OF NONPROFIT PROVIDERS WHO ARE PART OF THE MEN'S COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM AND ALSO THAT THE FEMALE VERSION CALLED THE CZ TRP. FOR MY PERSPECTIVE RIGHT NOW THERE'S ABOUT A THOUSAND OF THOSE BEDS IN THOSE BEDS FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE MEN AND THEY CAN BE RELEASED UP TO FOURTEEN MONTHS. BEFORE THE END OF THEIR SENTENCE. TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES IN THOSE PROGRAMS THEY CAN RECEIVE. NOT ONLY RYAN EDUCATION BUT TRUE WRAPAROUND SERVICES SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T REALLY PROVIDE BECAUSE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE RIGHT IN MADE IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM AT THE RIGHT TIME IN THE STATE THIS BIG. BUT IN A COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOHN STORAGE DISTRICT THAT'S REALLY EXCELLENT THEY DO A VERY NICE JOB. BUT WHEN THOSE INMATES COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAMS THEY HAVE JOBS THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING THAT WRAP AROUND SERVICES. I TO ADDRESS THERE ARE. ANY OUR CRIMINAL GENIC NEEDS THAT THEY MAY STILL HAVE IN THE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE YOU'LL GET THE KIND OF OUR RECIDIVISM REDUCTIONS THAT THAT THE STATE NEEDS. SO WHAT ARE THE RISKS IN MY PURSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE REST OF LARGELY POLITICAL. I THESE INMATES SHOULD THEY WALK AWAY FROM THESE FACILITIES AND COMMIT A CRIME THAT'S A POLITICAL PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNOR. FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THE TRUTH IS THESE INMATES WERE GOING TO BE RELEASED ANYWAY. AND SO RELEASE IN THEM AND A MATTER OF MONTHS EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN A SETTING WHERE THEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE TO SUCCEED. ACTUALLY IN FROM WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA MAKE IT A SAFER PLACE TO LIVE. WILL HELP THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS RE ENTER SUCCESSFUL WEIGHT I DON'T THAT'S NOT ONLY AN ISSUE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING BUT ALSO FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT I THINK ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S WHERE I WOULD INVEST MY MIND MY MONEY AND MY TIME IF I WERE IN YOUR CHAIRS. RIGHT NOW THERE'S ONLY A THOUSAND FIFTY OF THOSE BEDS I THINK THE STATE SHOULD INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS OVER TIME AGAIN I REPRESENT SOME OF THE NONPROFIT TO DO THIS WORK IN ALL CANDOR BUT- I DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. FOR THE RIGHT REASONS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NATASHA MINSKER I'M AN ATTORNEY AND CONSULTANT AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. MY TOPIC IS FRONT AND SOLUTIONS TO REDUCING THE PRISON POPULATION. AND I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON TWO APPROACHES. ONE GIVE PUBLIC DEFENDERS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS WELL. AN TO SENTENCING REFORM. YEAH WHAT A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN PLACATE TO THE ROLE OF JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM VERY LITTLE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. IT IS THE JOB OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER TO KEEP THEIR CLIENT OUT OF PRISON. LET'S GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT JOB WELL. IF PUBLIC DEFENDERS HAD MORE RESOURCES THEY WOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING INNOCENT PEOPLE FROM WRONGFUL CONVICTION. AND THEY WOULD DO A BETTER JOB CONFRONTING THE ROUTINE OVER CHARGING BY PROSECUTORS THAT LEADS TO UNFAIR AND UNNECESSARILY LONG SENTENCES. PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE ALSO IN DAILY CONTACT WITH THE NEEDIEST PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SONICALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS IN PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER I SAID TO A JUDGE. MY CLIENT NEEDS A PROGRAM. AND I WAS MET WITH THE RETORT. WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOUR CLIENT IT'S CALLED STATE PRISON. WHAT A NUMBER OF TIMES I QUOTE SUCCEEDED I GETTING MY CLIENT OUT OF JAIL AND WONDERED WHY SINCE HE WOULD BE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS THAT NIGHT. IMAGINE A WORLD IN WHICH PUBLIC DEFENDERS HAD SOCIAL WORKERS AND NAVIGATORS TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS FIND STABLE HOUSING AND TREATMENT. WORLD IN WHICH FROM THE FIRST ENCOUNTER PUBLIC DEFENDER COULD SAY HOW CAN I HELP WHAT DO YOU NEED HOW DO WE KEEP YOU OUT OF PRISON FOREVER. WE HAVE AN ARMY OF ADVOCATES WORKING TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON AND HELP THE NEEDIEST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. LET'S GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT JOB WELL. I WANT TO ADDRESS IN SENTENCING REFORM. IF THE ROLE OF JUDGES TO DECIDE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AND FAIR SENSES IN AN INDIVIDUAL CASE AND IF THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SET THE PARAMETERS FOR JUDGES TO ENSURE FAIR AND JUST SENSE IS AN INDIVIDUAL CASES AND TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIANS AS A WHOLE. OUR SENTENCING LAWS FAILED TO ACHIEVE THOSE BASIC GOALS. I'M GONNA SUGGEST FIVE SPECIFIC SENSING REFORMS THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER. ONE I WOMEN EIGHT THE REMAINING RESTRICTIONS THAT PREVENT JUDGES FROM CHOOSING A SENTENCE OTHER THAN PRISON. GIVE JUDGES FULL DISCRETION TO CHOOSE PROBATION OR CHOOSE A PROGRAM WHERE TO STRIKE AN ENHANCEMENT SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO PRISON. TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUING LEGACY OF THE WAR ON DRUGS IN OUR SENTENCING LAWS. THAT SENDS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE SENDS FOR SALE OF COCAINE INCLUDING CRACK. IS THREE YEARS STATE PRISON. THE LOWEST POSSIBLE SENDS FOR SALE OF HEROIN IS SIXTEEN MONTHS. THAT SPECIFIC DISPARITY ADDRESSING BACK TO SEVERITY WOULD HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON OUR JAIL POPULATIONS IT IS A STARK EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE WAR ON DRUGS CONTINUES TO IMPACT OUR SENTENCING LAWS AND UNFAIR WAY. THREE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD RE EVALUATE SENTENCES. FOR THE OFFENSES THAT LEAD TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PRISON COMMITMENTS WHICH ARE SALT AND ROBBERY. IF WE WERE TO REDUCE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE SENSE FROM SIXTEEN MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS OR EVEN FOURTEEN MONTHS. JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS LESS ABOUT WHAT WAS SENDS. BECAUSE IT IMPACTS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE POPULATION WITH HAVING NO IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY. FOUR WE NEED TO BRING BACK THE COMMONSENSE RULES WE USED TO HAVE THAT LIMITED STACKING ENHANCEMENTS AND SENSES ONE ON TOP OF THE. WE USE RULES IN CALIFORNIA THAT SAID YOU CAN'T HAVE AN ENHANCEMENT FOR USE OF A WEAPON AND THEN I ALSO HAVE AN ENHANCEMENT FOR THE INJURY THAT THAT WEAPON BECAUSE- AND HAVE ANOTHER ENHANCEMENT ON ON TOP OF THAT. WE USED TO HAVE RULES THAT SAID THE STANDS FOR YOUR OFFENSE. NEEDS TO BE THE LARGEST PART YOUR SENTENCE AND ENHANCEMENTS NEED TO BE JUST A TINY PORTION ADDED ON. WE GOT RID OF THOSE RULES. AND THEN EXTREME SENSING BECAME THE NORM IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR PRISON POPULATION EXPLODED WE NEED TO BRING BACK THOSE COMMONSENSE RULES THEY WORKED ONCE THEY WILL WORK AGAIN. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DO MORE TO ADDRESS BY CARRIER LIABILITY THAT'S WHEN ONE. IS PUNISHED FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER PERSON. YOU DID A GREAT JOB MADE A GREAT START WITH THE FELONY MURDER RULE BUT WE HAVE MORE ENHANCEMENTS AND MORE OFFENSES THAT PUNISH ONE PERSON FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S BEHAVIOR FOR EXAMPLE THE GUN ENHANCEMENT. WE CAN ADD TEN OR TWENTY YEARS ON A PERSON'S SENTENCE WHEN THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A GUN. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE ONLY SENDS AND HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR. FINALLY THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT REDUCING THE PRISON POPULATION HAS TO INCLUDE MENTION OF THE THREE STRIKES LAW. THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT REFORM TO REDUCING OUR PRISON POPULATION AND ENDING EXTREME SENSING IT'S TO REPEAL THE THREE STRIKES LAW. THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THESE IDEAS WITH YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK EVERYONE IS SPOKEN RIGHT OKAY WONDERFUL OF THE ANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YEAH. MINE WORKS HERE. SO. MAYBE IT IS ANYONE CAN IT GET ENOUGH. WE TRY TO ADDRESS THIS PART OF WHAT EACH OF YOUR ST IS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE WAY WE DEAL WITH GROW JUSTICE IN GENERAL I JUST GOT BACK FROM NORWAY. IN NORWAY. THEY BELIEVE THAT THE SENTENCE THE JUDGE GIVE YOU IS YOUR PUNISHMENT. PLUS THEY WILL ALSO SAY YOU CAN'T SERVE MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS WHICH MEANS. WHEN YOU GO TO PRISON IT'S ABOUT REHABILITATION. BECAUSE YOU'RE COMING OUT WHAT YOU KILL ONE PERSON OR TWO HUNDRED ONE PEOPLE THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU MIGHT COME OUT AGAINST WOMEN TO REHABILITATE IF YOU STILL WANNA GRAIN OF CORN OR OR BUSH A GREATER QUIRK YOU'RE COMING OUT SO WE NEED TO REBUILD SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS THERE. THAT THAT THAT. WHAT PART OF IN THIS IS THE POLITICAL THING. THE REASON THAT STARTED. THIS WHOLE PARADIGM SHIFT. IS NUMBER TWO DURING THE **** OCCUPATION. OF THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. AND WHEN THEY GET OUT THEY CAN BEGIN TO PRIME MINISTER ANY RAN THE COUNTRY. IN THEIR MIND THEY HAVE A SAYING IF YOU WANT REFORM TO PRISON SYSTEM YOU NEED SEND EVERY POLITICIAN TO PRESENT. ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING. I KNOW IT SOUNDS FUNNY BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE IN PRISON AND ALL THE ATROCITIES THAT THE NAZI'S INFLICTED ON THEM IN MIND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TRY TO CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S. VERSION OF VISION OF WHAT. THE ABILITY ASIAN SHOULD BE ENRICHED EXCEPT IT WAS DIFFICULT BUT THEY HAD A AN INFRASTRUCTURE OF POLITICIANS WHO WERE. PRESENT AND WOOD. THE CHANGES IN OUR PRIME MINISTER TIME DID THAT AND SO THIS IS A HUGE LEFT IS NOT AS EASY AS AS AS WE WOULD THINK AND SO I. TO JOIN WITH US TO TRY TO CHANGE MINDS IF ANYONE THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU KNOW IT YET THESE ARE GREAT PROGRAMS ARE GREAT BUT IF YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DO WE PUT TOGETHER THAT THIS THIS WHOLE NEW SYSTEM BUT ALSO TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC. THAT THIS IS GOOD NOT LEAVE IT WOULD JUST ONE EXAMPLE I WAS ABLE TO GET A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR REHABILITATION EARLY ON IN MY CAREER IN TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE REPUBLICANS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE. THREE STRIKES LAW IN ORDER TO SAY. IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON. I CAN SAVE YOU EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IF YOU GIVE ME A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND GIVE YOU A BILLION DOLLARS BACK SO THEY GAVE ME A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO DO REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. AND YOU COULD SELL THAT TO THE PUBLIC AND THEY COULD THEY COULD GRASP IN JUNE AT AND SO I HAVE. THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO TOOK TO MAKE THIS MORE PALATABLE TO THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE AS OBVIOUSLY RECEPTIVE IS THIS AUDIENCE TO TRY THESE IDEAS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST US IN THIS ROOM WE'VE GOT TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE OUTSIDE THIS ROOM. WHO DON'T WHO MAY NOT BE AS IN LIKE. AS WE ARE. AND EVERYBODY'S LOOKING IMAGE TO KATE NOW. I'LL SHOW THAT I THINK ONE THE PUBLIC IS MORE ON OUR SIDE THAN WE KNOW IN IN IN EVERY CALL EVERY SURVEY OF THE PUBLIC SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WANT FUNDING FOCUSED ON. COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS AND INVESTING IN HEALTH CARE AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IT'S ON US TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT WHEN WE FOR EXAMPLE GIVE SOCIAL WORKERS TO PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS FIND HOUSING AND TREATMENT. THAT IS ABOUT ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE GET PROPER HEALTH CARE AND THAT WHEN WE ARE INVESTING IN EDUCATION THAT INCLUDES EDUCATION THAT KEEPS PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON AND HELPS PEOPLE IMPRISONED. SUCCEED WHEN THEY COME OUT SO I THINK IT'S THE SUPPORT FOR SHIFTING AMONG THE PUBLIC OF SHIFTING FUNDING TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES IS THERE AND WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. WOULD YOU SAY. NUMBER I WAS GONNA SAY REHABILITATION DOES EQUATE TO PUBLIC SAFETY NEW GIVE SOMEBODY A SKILL THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE AND THE ACTUAL CHANCE TO SUCCEED AS MATT TALKED ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS. THEREFORE NOT TO GET A JOB RIGHT TO HELP WAS TO HAVE THIS KIND OF A SOFT LANDING PLACE WHILE THE FIGURE OUT THEIR NEXT STEP SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY WHEN YOU CAN PRO ROLE WITH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IN YOUR POCKET TO WHERE YOU CAN BUY A CAR. RENDON APARTMENT YOU HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCESS. OUR PART OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T TWO SENTENCES. BUT WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE REFORM AS AN AGENCY AND I'VE BEEN WITH THIS AGENCY LONGER THAN I HEAR TALK ABOUT ABOUT THIRTY TWO PLUS YEARS AND I BELIEVE IN THE EVOLUTION THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH THAT IT'S TIME. YOU DON'T HAVE IN OUR POPULATION I REMEMBER OUR POPULATION HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND IT WAS NOT FUN WORKING INSIDE THE INSTITUTIONS AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND. FOR ANYBODY. AND SO SEEN THAT THAT SHIFT AND SO WE HAVE A ROLE IN THAT. AND TO PREPARE EVERYONE FOR RELEASE AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A ROLE AND I YOU KNOW I SHARE WITH GUYS AND GET IT A CHANCE OF A LIFETIME WHETHER THEY WERE. HUNDRED EIGHTY YEARS TO LIFE AND THEY GOT. A RECALL OF SATINS WHAT A GIFT THAT WAS YOU HAVE TO BE AN AMBASSADOR OF THAT. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL SO THAT. PEOPLE WILL SOFTEN UP TO FURTHER REFORMS AS THEY COME DOWN. I GUESS THE RUNNING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT IF YOU'RE CONVICTED IN LOS ANGELES DURING THE BAY AREA YOU'RE NOT SENT TO. A LOS ANGELES OR BAY AREA FACILITY YOU YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE SENT TO WASCO OR IT CENTRAL VALLEY OR- TO LASSEN COUNTY OR TO PELICAN BAY. AND I THINK TO WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO OFFENDERS HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SO THAT MEANS TAKING. TRYING TO KEEP MORE OFFENDERS LOCAL. AND THEN WHEN THEY NEVER LEAVE OUR COMMUNITY BEGIN WITH. OR IT MEANS RETURNING THEM BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE. SUPPORTED BY THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BY THEIR FRIENDS BY THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE HEARTS AND MINDS ARE AND SO AGAIN. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH RE ENTRY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH DISH NO PROBATION SERVICES KEEPING. CRIMINAL JUSTICE LOCAL IS THE KEY TO THE HEARTS AND MINDS ARGUMENT I THINK. JUST VERY QUICKLY TO SECRETARY QUE KIND OF WHAT YOU ADVOCATED FOR IS THIS EXPANSION OF THE MAIL COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM IN THE CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL YET YOU PROGRAM. ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS HOW DO YOU SCALE THAT YOU HAD A TIME WHERE WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY BUILDING HOUSING EXPANDING THAT FOOTPRINT HOW HOW COULD WE ACTUALLY SCALE IT TO GET TO THE KINDS OF NUMBERS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE. THAN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS. WELL I THINK IS DO IT AND SO THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T GO FROM A THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND. RIGHT THAT'S JUST ONE LITTLE STEP. AND THEN IF YOU PUT THAT BUT THAT OUT TO BID YOU LET THOSE THOSE NONPROFITS AND OTHERS CAN AND COMPETE. AND YOU GO COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY AND YOU JUST DO YOUR BEST A LITTLE AT A TIME THE PRISON SYSTEM DIDN'T YOU KNOW GROW TO WHERE IT IS OVERNIGHT EITHER. AND SO THE SOLUTION SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS A SOMETHING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN I MEAN WE GO FROM A THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND HAVE A FIVE YEAR PLAN. TO CLOSE ONE PRISON. RIGHT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I THINK YOU CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. GOOD YOU HAD MENTIONED I THINK YOU'RE DECLARE WHAT THE POLITICAL RISK OF IF YOU HAD JUST ONE PERSON. RE OFFEND THAT HAPPEN TO BE IN THIS. PARTICULAR PROGRAM SO HOW DO YOU. HOW DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SORT OF. TRY TO PREVENT THAT GREAT THING ABOUT BEING A LAWMAKERS THAT YOU CAN MAKE A LAW. AND SO. IT IS ALSO IF YOU'RE THE SECRETARY OF CORRECTIONS YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE REGULATION. TO THE GOVERNOR IN SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE A PROGRAM WHERE WE YOUR RELEASED IT'S A CONDITIONAL RELEASE. AND SO YOU'RE NOT AN ENEMY. STILL IN ONE OF THESE NCRP PROGRAMS YOU'RE NOW A POORLY OR YOUR CONDITIONALLY RELEASED. FOR EARLY AND SO IF YOU IF YOU MESS UP YEAH YOU CAN GO BACK TO PRISON AND HAVE TO SERVE THE REMAINDER OF YOUR TIME. BUT THERE'S WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO NOT IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE ANY LONGER AS INMATES WE CAN CALL THEM SOMETHING ELSE SO THAT IF IT IF SOMEBODY HAS A FAMILY EMERGENCY OR OR OBEYED JUST MAKE ANOTHER MISTAKE RIGHT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN RELAPSE IS GONNA HAVE WE KNOW THAT SCIENTIFICALLY IS TRUE. THESE DON'T NEED TO BE ESCAPES RIGHT THEY NEED TO THEY CAN BE PAROLE VIOLATION AND THESE AND THESE. HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE DEALT WITH THROUGH AN APPROPRIATE SANCTION APPROPRIATE TREATMENT BASED ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY THEY BY CALLING THEM INMATES AND BY CALL ONLY TIMES EVERY TIME SOMEBODY DOESN'T SHOW FOR CURFEW TO SAY THERE'S BEEN IN THE SKATE. IS RIDICULOUS IT'S JUST TOO MUCH POLITICAL RISK YOU DON'T NEED. TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. THAT EVEN IT SORT OF MY VERY PROGRESSIVE DISTRICT OF SAN FRANCISCO THE PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP. ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PROPERTY CRIMES IN THE AUTO BURGLARIES AND THEY NEVER SAY WILL. YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THE NEVER THANK AND PROP 47-57 THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING THEIR COSTLY ASKING FOR ENHANCEMENT NOW THEY ARE. THEY ARE THE MINORITY HOW DO YOU CREATE THE- PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT TECHNICAL WORK WITH THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT THINK THAT. THE PUBLIC OVERALL IS WHAT YOU DESCRIBE BUT THEY'RE NOT THE FOLKS THAT SHOW UP. TO ALL OF OUR MEETINGS ALL OVER TOWN HOMES ARE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE. BEING BEING FRANKLY VOCAL OR PARTICIPATORY. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT YOU ARE USING ON. THE BACK. I THINK IT'S REALLY. WHY THE TWO IDEAS I TALK ABOUT THE BEST HAND IN HAND WHY IT'S REALLY REALLY I THINK IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AMONG THE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CYCLING THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON A DAILY BASIS I THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST AT THAT IS A REALITY AND WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THE FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO. AND MY NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN THE SAME WAY AND I LOOK AT THEM AND SAY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WE LIVE IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT THEY SEE THEY CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON WHAT. THAT'S THAT'S THEM AND THEY ARE GIVEN MESSAGES VERY INTENTIONALLY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THIS IS BECAUSE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN RIGHT THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL ASSOCIATION THAT MY NEIGHBORS HAVE COME UP WITH BY THEMSELVES RIGHT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL WHO CAME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION SAID YEAH THE PROBLEM IS PROP FORTY SEVEN GAVE THEM ALL THE TALKING POINTS. SO WE NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT AND SAY. CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS OF PEOPLE HUMAN BEINGS WHO DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO SLEEP AND CYCLING IN AND OUT OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS REAL. AND WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THAT. AND I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE BEST AND LEAST USED RESOURCES IF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN THE CONTACT THEIR MAKING EVERY DAY. WITH THE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED HELP. BUT WE I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT IN AND THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR IT. JUST WANT TO SAY AS AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED PROBABLY THERE'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT HASN'T BEEN RAISED TODAY THAT. MANY OF US HAVE NOT TRIED TO DO. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT THE PUBLIC NO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT THE FOLKS AT THE PIER OF. DON'T WANT TO DO THAT THESE ARE THE THESE ARE THE WARRIORS WHO DO IT. AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE DO AND WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS RELATED TO IT. I THINK YOU'VE SEEN MOST WERE RECENTLY THE A WE'VE BEEN LIMITED THE ENHANCEMENTS SOME OF THE ENHANCEMENTS SO THAT WAS IMPORTANT. TERMS OF REDUCING THAT AS WELL AS CHANGING THE THIS THE DEFINITION OF CRACK COCAINE. OF SO THAT IT'S NOT THE UP HEAVY HAVE BEEN THE THING AS IT WAS BEFORE. IN THE END AND BASICALLY TREATING IT AS COCAINE. WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO BEEN INCARCERATED. AND OUT AND WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR SENTENCING REFORM. AND THAT'S A HARD THING TO DO AND WE AND WHILE WE HAVE ADVOCATES AND SUPPORTERS AT CDC ARE SOME OF THEM. WE ALSO HAVE TO DO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE POWERFUL LOBBY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I KNOW THAT FROM THREE NINE TWO. THE POWERFUL LOBBY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH ALSO SAYS THEY DID NOT AS POWERFUL AS IT USED TO BE. SO WE KNOW THAT WE CAN BE DONE BUT IT REQUIRES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SUPPORT. FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND I THINK WE PASS LAWS THAT THAT LET US KNOW PEOPLE. OF WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU PUT IT OUT THERE LIKE THAT BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU POINT OUT. THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS PEOPLE BLAME IT ON BOTH THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW. AND AS A RESULT WE FIND OURSELVES BATTLING TO MAKE SURE THE PROPERTY SEVEN PROP WITH. THIS NUMBER THAT NUMBER BASICALLY SURVIVE SO WE'VE GOT A TREMENDOUS TASK HERE BUT I THINK WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO. OF THE. ONE THING WE HAVE DONE IN THE LEGISLATURE'S WE HAVE COMMITTED OURSELVES. TO REHABILITATION. WHEN I CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF SENTENCING. WE WANTED TO PUT. SOMETHING FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND REHABILITATION. WE COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH THOSE TWO WORDS WE HAD PUT PUNISHMENT IN IT. THERE'S PEOPLE LIKE PUNISHMENT. EVEN THOSE BEING IN PRISON IS A PUNISHMENT BY ITSELF. BUT WE COULD NOT GET THAT BILL PASSED WITHOUT PUNISHMENT THROWN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. SO WE DID CHANGE IT FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND REHABILITATION BUT PUNISHMENT IS STILL THERE. BECAUSE THAT'S THE MENTALITY. OF FOLKS WITH REGARDS TO. PUBLIC SAFETY. SO WE STILL BATTLING THESE ISSUES A VERY GOOD. DISCUSSION THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OF SIN OF SECRETARY KATE. WHAT YOU RECOMMEND. THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND AS WE BEGIN TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE POPULATION AND REDUCE. RECIDIVISM AT THE SAME TIME THIS OBVIOUSLY. BECOMES A MAJOR PIECE OF IT SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK. OUR THIRD POINT MENTAL AND WE WANT TO TRY TO GET THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE A- SOME OF YOU WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO ASK. WE'RE GOING TO ASK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THAT YOU KEEP THEM TO QUESTIONS. AND NOT DISSERTATIONS NOT LONG STATE LET'S OF PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND- ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT WE REALLY HAD IF THERE'S A QUESTION TO BE ASKED. THINK ABOUT IT AS A QUESTION NOT AS A STATEMENT. OKAY WE'LL BE ABLE THAT THIRD PANEL WITH HEARING FROM CDC ARE. AS WELL AS SOMEONE FROM LA AND SOMEONE FROM THE OFFICE OF THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR COMING. WOULD TAKE THEM IN THAT ORDER SO CVC OURS FIRST. OF FOLLOWED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND. THEN FOLLOWED BY OFFICERS BACK AGAIN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME'S RUNS USE THAT I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WITHIN C. C. R. I THINK KEEPING WITH YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENTS I'M GONNA TRY AND KEEP IT BRIEF AND NOT READ DIRECTLY FROM MY NOTES BUT I WANT TO KIND OF BRIEFLY DESCRIBE SOME OF THE RE ENTRY EFFORTS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT CITY SEE OUR- REALLY. RE ENTRY STARTS FORTY RPG AND THE DIVISION AT RECEPTION IT STARTS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST ORIENTATION PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT STANDS BEHIND AND THAT WE HAVE OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED WITH RIGHT IN THE VERY BEGINNING SO THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS FOR US AND THEN WE FOCUS SIMPLY ON MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT. EDUCATIONAL FOCUSING ON ACHIEVING A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SEE GETTING PEOPLE MOTIVATED TO COLLEGE AND REALLY CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON THOSE EDUCATIONAL FACTORS SOMETIMES FACTORS THAT HAVE I HAD DECADES OF FAILURES IN ATTENDANCE AND HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEM I'M SO REALLY STARTING TO FOCUS ON THOSE THINGS AND THEN. NOT BY ACCIDENT CDC ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSED A LOT OF ITS PROGRAMMING NEAR THE END OF INCARCERATIONS THOSE PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS THINGS THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC NEEDS LIKE SUBSTANCE USE OR ANGER MANAGEMENT VICTIM IMPACT AND THEN ALSO CAREER TECHNICAL TRADES ARE UNDERSECRETARY SPOKE A LOT ABOUT. BUT REALLY CREATING TRADES THAT ARE INNOVATIVE COST EFFECTIVE AND ARE TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE A SKILL NOT JUST TO BE TRAINED IN AN AREA BUT TO REALLY HAVE A CERTIFICATION SOMETHING LIKE AUTO MECHANICS TO WALK OUTSIDE AND SAY THERE'S NO HOW TO REPAIR A MOTOR BUT I HAVE AN EIGHT THE CERTIFICATION I HAVEN'T I CARP CERTIFICATION SO REALLY INTO INTO A LOT. AND LATER ALL WITH TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN MAJOR STRUGGLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT THAT SOMETHING WITTY TECHNOLOGY. IN THE SYSTEM THAT THEY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING GET OUT. PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND IN OUR SYSTEM THROUGH THICK AND THIN WHEN THINGS ARE CUT AND C. C. R. WHEN THEY'RE NOT CUT OR TREATMENT PROVIDERS THAT ARE. I COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NON PROFITS THE COMING DELIVER TREATMENT. THEY BELIEVE IN IT THEY MOTIVATE ME EVERY DAY TO COME BACK TO WORK BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. IN A SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HEARD. IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO IT WE ARE A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE AND WE ARE PUSHING OUR WAY AND BECAUSE REHABILITATION IS SO IMPORTANT. AND SO I CAN'T GIVE ENOUGH CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE THAT COME IN. OFTENTIMES FINDING OTHER FISCAL RESOURCES TO COME IN AND CONTINUE DOING THAT SO. THAT'S A BIG THING THAT WE REALLY FOCUS WE THINK IS IMPORTANT SO. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IN TERMS OF WHAT I FEEL LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR RE ENTERING WHAT THE DEPARTMENT REALLY STAND BEHIND. IS REALLY COMING IN ASSESSING WHAT PEOPLE NEED. AND IT'S NOT A IF THEN STATEMENT. IT'S REALLY ADDRESSING THE WHOLE PERSON AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED. AND SO THEY MIGHT NEED AN EDUCATION OR THEY MIGHT NEED TO CAREER TECHNICAL TRADE. THEY ALSO NEED TIME IN THE EVENING TO ENJOY OTHER PEOPLE'S COMPANY WORK ON COMMUNICATION. DO YOU AYE YOGA GARDENING ALL OF THESE THINGS. A PERSONAL STORY MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS THROUGH THE ROOF. AND SO I DIDN'T STOP GOING TO COLLEGE BECAUSE MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS THROUGH THE ROOF I STARTED DOING YOGA. SO NOW YOU FINISH COLLEGE AND YOU DO YOGA IN THE EVENINGS. AND THE BLOOD PRESSURE HAS COME DOWN AND I THINK OUR POPULATION EXISTS THE SAME. WE'VE HEARD IT TODAY. A RE ENTRY STARTS FROM RECEPTION. RE ENTRY IS REALLY ABOUT ADDRESSING THE ENTIRE PERSON. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A DICHOTOMY OF. THIS OR THAT BUT I'M REALLY FOCUSING ON GIVING PEOPLE. EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE REHABILITATION. IN A ROBUST WAY. AND THEN BRIEFLY SPEAKING ARE MIL COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS THAT FORMER SECRETARY KATE DISCUSS. THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS AND GIVING THOSE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS TO PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN. REINTEGRATE BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY IN A POSITIVE WAY. AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE COMING BACK IN. AND THEN FOLLOWING UP YOU KNOW IT'S ONE TREATMENT EPISODE IN TWO LOCATIONS IS HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT REHABILITATION. IT STARTS ON THE INSIDE BUT IT ENDS ON THE OUTSIDE. AND JUST TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT SOME SOMETHING ELSE AND YOUR P. THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT. IN IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN EARLY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE SAT DOWN AS AN EXECUTIVE TEAM AND REALLY SAID. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON QUALITY. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON RESOURCES THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON DATA COLLECTION SO WE- UNDERTOOK A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT END UP. A REALLY KIND OF PLAYS OUT IN CONVERSATIONS TODAY AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING. REALLY TO TRY AND PROVE. THAT WE CAN. DO THIS AND IT DOES. WORK IF IT'S DONE CORRECTLY IN IN THE RIGHT SYSTEM SO. I WANTED TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MEDICATION ARE OVER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WHICH WAITED OVER SECOND SORRY I'LL BE WORKING OFF THIS HAND OUT IMPROVING IN PRISON REHABILITATION. PROGRAMS SO GOING ON OF THE FIRST PAGE IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT IDENTIFYING SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION THE STATE AUDIT ARE ALSO IDENTIFIED SIMILAR SHORTCOMINGS IN AN AUDIT RELEASED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND ARTICLE IS FOUND THAT THAT PROGRAMS ARE NOT EVIDENCE BASED SOME PROGRAMS ON EVIDENCE BASED BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED OFF OF MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND EVEN IN CASES WHERE THEY ARE HAVE YOU SEE OUR DOES NOT CALL ME VALUE IT WHETHER THEY OPERATE WITH FIDELITY TO THOSE MODELS SECOND. PROGRAMS IN ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY TARGETED AT HIGH RISK HIGH NEED IN EIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE MANY INMATES WITH HIGH RATE THE NEEDS ARE THESE WITHOUT HAVING DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY OF THE NEEDED PROGRAMS DESPITE THOUSANDS OF LOW RISK AND LOW NEED INMATES BEING ASSIGNED MORE OVERT THIS DOESN'T TOOL USED TO ASSIGN THE INMATES MY NOT REALLY IDENTIFIED ON THE- GIVEN THAT IT WAS CREATED WITH DATA THAT IS NOW OVER TEN YEARS OLD. WAIT LET IT. MANY PROGRAMS OUGHT TO REMAIN VACANT AND MOREOVER MANY ENROLLED IN MADE DO NOT ACTUALLY ATTEND THE PROGRAMS. AND FINALLY THE PROGRAMS ARE SUBJECT TO FLAWED PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT THESE ALL BLACKS KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES. SUCH AS THE LATE THE PARTICIPATION BEFORE THESE AND IN ADDITION SOME METRICS ARE MISLEADING FOR EXAMPLE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IS DEFINED AS BEING ENROLLED FOR THIRTY DAYS REGARDLESS OF PROGRAM LANE. OR THE ACTUAL ATTENDANCE RATE. THESE ARE HAS TAKEN SOME STRESS TO ADDRESS THESE SHORTCOMINGS RIGHT HAS SPOKEN ABOUT SOME OF THEM BUT FOR EXAMPLE CITIES ARE HAS STATED THAT IT WILL REQUIRE CONTRACTOR THAT PROVIDE SOME SERVICES TO USE MODELS SHOWN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND IT IS IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTING FIDELITY ASSESSMENT FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THE JUDGE ALSO SAY THAT IT'S TAKEN STEPS TO BETTER TARGET IN MADE INCLUDING. FOR THE GUIDANCE TO INMATE ASSIGNMENT OFFICERS. I MEAN WHETHER TO SEVEN TOOLS SHOULD BE RE VALIDATED OR REPLACED. AND CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF PROGRAMS BEING SHUT DOWN DUE TO A LACK OF STAFF. WE WOULD RECOMMEND TAKING SOME ADDITIONAL STEPS TO IMPROVE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FIRST WE WOULD RECOMMEND REQUIREMENT THAT PROGRAMS BE EVIDENCE BASED TO DO THIS. WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING TV ARE TO REPORT WHETHER EACH REHABILITATION PROGRAM IS BASED ON RESEARCH SHOWING IT IS EFFECTIVE. THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE THIS A CONDITION FOR ON GOING FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED BY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED WITH FIDELITY. WE ALSO RECOMMEND HAVING INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS EVALUATE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED EIGHTY SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. WHICH WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BUT IT WAS RECENTLY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. THIRTY WE RECOMMEND MORE EFFECTIVELY TARGETING PROGRAMS YOUR HIGH RISK HIGH NEED INMATES RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING A REVIEW COMMITTEE INCLUDING X. DONALD J. COLE OR AN EXPERT. TO USE SELECT THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS MOST EFFECTIVE IDENTIFYING HIGH RISK HIGH NEED IN ME. JUNE SHORT CD SHOP PRIORITIZE HIGH RISK HIGH NEED IN MADE WE ALSO RECOMMEND TALKING STOCK YOU DIRECTING IT TO DO SO. FOURTH WE RECOMMEND IMPROVING EFFICIENT USE OF EXISTING REHABILITATION RESOURCES. RECOMMEND DIRECTING TV STAR TO ASSESS THE FACILITIES TO IDENTIFY THE RESOURCES REQUIRED. TO MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF HIGH RISK HIGH NEED IN A- WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE INCORPORATE ACTUAL INMATE ATTENDANCE INTO PROGRAM FUNDING DECISIONS TO MINIMUM. LIMIT THE NUMBER OF SLOTS ARE NOT USED EFFICIENTLY. FIFTH WE RECOMMEND IMPROVING PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO CONDUCT REGULAR OVERSIGHT IN ORDER TO ENABLE REGULAR PROGRAM OVERSIGHT WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING TV SEE ARE YOU IMPROVING REPORT ON CERTAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURES INCLUDING THE PERCENTAGE OF INMATES WITH UNMET NEEDS THE OWNER LAYS. FINALLY WE'LL NOTE THAT CONTINUE TREATMENT UPON RELEASE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REBUILD WE ABILITY ASIAN. WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING INTO PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH CDC ARE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT THEIR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THOSE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU AND HAVE ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. AFTERNOON I'M ROY WESLEY I'M THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE STATE OR JURISDICTION IS OVERSIGHT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM. AND WITH REGARD TO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. WE PRIMARILY LOOK AT. ABOUT A TWICE A YEAR AUDIT OF HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE. I ROLLED OUT SO TWICE HERE WE GO OUT AND COUNT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN SEATS COUNT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMPLETED THAT SORT OF THING. OUR MISSION IS TRANSPARENCY SO UNLIKE THE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS THE HANDS ON WHO'S ON THE GROUND ORGANIZATION. OUR JOB IS TO GO INTO A CLOSED SYSTEM THAT IS NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDE SOME. INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC TO TELL YOU ALL WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S DOING. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH RYAN'S TEAM WE HAVE A ORGANIZATION CALLED THE REHABILITATION OVERSIGHT BOARD. THAT MEETS ABOUT THREE TIMES A YEAR IT'S GOT EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE STATE THAT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. AND THE RESPONSE BY THE DEPARTMENT HAS BY AND LARGE BEEN VERY GOOD THEY HAVE A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE INCLUDING RYAN AT THE SHOE DEPARTMENT AND THEY PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT IN THE PROGRAMS. WHERE THE WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES IS THE EXECUTION OF THE FIELD. OF WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THE EXECUTION IS. SPOT IS UNEVEN AND THE. THE DEMAND BY THE HEADQUARTERS THAT WE GET THE RIGHT INMATES IN THE RIGHT SEATS AND THAT WE WANT ALL THE SEATS FILLED TURNS INTO I GOT TO HAVE PEOPLE IN SEATS REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND SO WE SEE PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE AND TRANSITIONS CLASSES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST SIX MONTHS YOU'RE IN PRISON PREPARING YOU TO GO OUT INTO. FREE SOCIETY WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIX NEW YEARS LEFT ON THEIR SENSE. OF. THAT IS THE CHALLENGE THE DEPARTMENT FACES AND THE WE TRY TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC AND OUR LEGISLATORS KNOW IS HAPPENING OUT ON THE GROUND LOOK. I THINK THAT. EVERYBODY IS. IS TRYING THEIR BEST TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK IT'S THAT. HOW THAT EXECUTION ACTUALLY HAPPENS AT THE INSTITUTION IS DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A SPAN OF CONTROL THIRTY FOUR PRISONS AND LITERALLY OVER A THOUSAND PROGRAMS. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE THAT CONSISTENCY STATEWIDE OUR OFFICE HAS VERY SMALL OVERSIGHT. PIECE OF THAT WE DO NOT HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE PEOPLE IN THE IN THE FIELD. ON ON A REGULAR BASIS WELL REGULAR BASIS IS TWICE A YEAR BUT THAT'S. THAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT. IS WHAT'S NECESSARY AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DONE BY MY OFFICE IT CAN BE DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT IT CAN BE DONE BY OTHER AGENCIES BUT THERE HAS TO BE A RECOGNITION THAT. THE VISION THAT HAPPENS IN HEADQUARTERS HAS TO. BE CARRIED OUT AT THE AT THE LOCAL. SO THANK YOU IN A. ANSWERING QUESTIONS. I WAS JUST WONDERING IF. CDC ARE HAD A RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE LA THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. SAW THEM EARLIER BUT JUST. ESPECIALLY ON PAGE THREE IN TERMS OF JUST THE- SOME OF. NEXT STEPS THAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING. THANK YOU I AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY I THINK THAT RIGHT CRITICISM FROM FROM THE LA SO I'LL CALL CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM AND THE LEGISLATURE IS. ACT ABSOLUTELY CITIES ARE START TIME STRUGGLING DATE AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT IS A LOT OF THE IN IT. THAT WE PUT IN PLACE A COUPLE YEARS SO I'M A QUICKLY JUST GO THROUGH BALL BY BALL IT IF THAT'S OKAY PLEASE SO. REQUIRE PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN SPACE SO WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THE REQUIREMENT THAT ARE TREATMENT PROGRAMS ACADEMIC EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL PROGRAMS BE EVIDENCE BASED WHEN WE FIRST STARTED COLLECTING EVIDENCE BASED INFORMATION WE WERE COLLECTING EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE WERE USING AND NOT JUST THE PRIMARY CURRICULUMS ARE SECONDARY CREEK AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THINGS WERE LAYER. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE DID WORK WITH A FEW RESULTS FIRST AND IN THAT IN THAT WORK WHEN WE CAME OUT WE WANT TO PUBLISH IT WE WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT I DID A COLLECTION ABOUT 7275% WERE. NOTED AS NOT BEING EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM NOT THAT IT WAS FOUND TO BE NEGATIVE JUST THAT IT WASN'T IN THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE OR HAD NOT BEEN RESEARCHED. SO WE THOUGHT WHAT'S OUR FIRST INITIATIVE IS TAKE IT REALLY KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS EVIDENCE BASED SO WE'VE PUT OUT POLICY WITH ARE IN PRISON PROGRAMS EVEN AS OF RECENTLY FORCING THEM TO USE CURRICULUM IS WITHIN THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR PRIMARY CURRICULUM FOR IN PRISON PROGRAMS NOW THE LAST I CHECKED WAS ABOUT 95% WAS USING EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM IN THE RESULTS FIRST. CLEARING HOUSE. AS BEING EFFECTIVE. THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT IS. WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO HARM. PROGRAMS SURROUNDING AT ITS BASE THE DISCUSSION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR US. IN SAYING OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT PEOPLE TO COME IN THE PRISONS THAT ARE DOING THINGS LIKE YOGA. THAT ARE DOING THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW REALLY COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS REALLY RICH FAMILY REUNIFICATION. WE NEED DATA. BEFORE WE SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE AND SO THOSE PROGRAMS. NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT EVIDENCE BASED. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD GO AWAY THEY PROVIDE A REALLY HOLISTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. OTHER THINGS. SO THOSE ARE OFF THE SIDE WE HAVE RESEARCH AND IF THE- INITIATIVES AROUND SO. OUR PROGRAMS TREATMENT EDUCATION. AND CAREER TECHNICAL ARE REALLY FOCUS ON BEING OUT IN SPACE AND THAT THE SECONDARY PROGRAMS WE WANT TO GIVE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES WHICH I THINK WILL BE. AND THE SECOND OVER HERE. THE MEASURE COST EFFECTIVENESS I SAID THAT STARTED WITH YOU BUT- THAT HAS BEEN A BIG INITIATIVE FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE CONTINUE ON THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE- RECTIFIER SECRETARY INTERNALLY WE WANT TO PROVE THAT IT WORKS. NATIONAL YOU SEE EDUCATION WORKING. NATIONALLY YOU SEE ARTS PROGRAMS. WORKING IN SOME RESPECTS NATIONALLY YOU SEE SUBSTANCE USE PROGRAMS WORKING WHEN DELIVERED EFFECTIVELY. AND SO WE ARE PARTNERING WITH RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS NOW. TO BOTH CREATE FOUNDATIONAL PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE DOING IT RIGHT. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE OUTCOMES WORK. AND THAT JUST MEANS DATA COLLECTION AND SOME TIME BUT WE ARE DOING THAT. AS OF TODAY I'LL MENTION TO. THREE FUNDS. OKAY SORRY. YES SORRY ABOUT THAT. WE'RE WORKING WITH YOU SEE I TO CREATE FIDELITY TOOLS AND WE'RE ALSO DOING SOMETHING WITH PP I SEE IN A VERY LONGITUDINAL STUDY TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE WORKING WE HAVE INITIATIVES GOING WITH OUR COMMUNITY AS ORGANIZATIONS AFFECTED WITH TARGETING YES FOR USING TECHNOLOGY WE'RE TRYING TO NOT MAKE IT A GROUND LEVEL THING AND SAY FOLLOW TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY IS VERY SMART AND DO THE RIGHT FORMULAS AND USS PEOPLE CORRECTLY. AND THAT GOES TO THE LIGHTER TO REALLY TO IS WE PUT IN PLACE PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY REVIEWS FOR TREATMENT WE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE SAYS START CONNECTING WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO CREATE PRE AND POST SURVEYS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT WERE REALLY PUTTING FORWARD AS AS CRITICAL SO THAT WE CAN PROVE THAT WE'RE DOING REHABILITATION CORRECTLY WE'RE GIVING. EVERYONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE DOING IT CORRECTLY AS WELL. I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL. SURE WE GET ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND WE PROBABLY WILL DO IN THE YEAR. WE HAVE OUR HEARINGS IN SACRAMENTO OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY. HOWEVER I WANT TO GIVE THOSE OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION WE DON'T A MICROPHONE UP THERE. BUT YOU WANNA COME FORWARD AND GIVE US THAT QUESTION. WELL TAKE TWO OR THREE QUESTIONS AT THE MOST BECAUSE THAT TIME IS ALMOST UP. SO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION NOW ONE. ON YOU KNOW I WAS JUST IF THAT'S MY STUDENTS. A QUESTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BIG PREAMBLE TO A QUESTION. YES THEY- DO THIS THAT WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. DON'T GIVE US A LONG BACKGROUND. STORY OTHERWISE WOULD PROBABLY ONLY HEAR ONE PERSON. OKAY. YOUR QUESTION. MY NAME'S GRAHAM FROM JOHN WITH INITIATE JUSTICE I'M ALSO PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED. MY EXPERIENCE WITH INCARCERATION WAS THAT THE PROGRAMS WHILE THEY WERE BEING OFFERED IN THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS. I WAS INCARCERATED FOR FOURTEEN YEARS THEY WERE OFFERED IN THE- BEGINNING TWELVE. AND NOW THEY ARE OFFERED SO MY QUESTION WOULD BE. THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OFFERED IN OUR- ARE. MOSTLY LOWER LEVEL ONE TO LEVEL ONE LEVEL TWO PRISONS WITCHER. MEDIUM OR LOW SECURITY. WHY ARE THESE PROGRAMS NOT BEING OFFERED TO THE HIGHER SECURITY INMATES WHO. ARE GOING TO BOARD AT THE SAME RATE THAT PEOPLE ON LOWER FACILITIES ARE GOING. AND ARE COMING UP FOR RELEASE AND THEY NEED THOSE PROGRAMS TO COMPLETE BOARD. OKAY THANK YOU ANYONE HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. I COULDN'T BRIEFLY RESPOND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS HISTORICALLY NOT PUT. PROGRAMS AT ALL LEVELS IN NAMELY CAREER TECHNICAL PROGRAMS THINGS LIKE WELDING AND STUFF LIKE THAT. WE DO HAVE ACADEMIC EVERYWHERE WE'VE ACTUALLY PUT OUT GRANTS THAT ARE DIRECTLY FOCUSED ON CERTAIN. FACILITIES THAT ARE HIGHER LEVEL FACILITIES. AND WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS THAT BECAUSE WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE FAIR AND EQUITABLE ACCESS ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS EVERY DAY. THAT MEANS CHANGING POLICY AND DOING THINGS THAT APARTMENTS NEVER DONE BEFORE. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT OKAY THE NEXT PERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS DIANA CRUISES I AM EIGHT. I HAVE A LOVED ONE IN IN ONE OF THESE PRISONS. AND HEARING A LOT ABOUT PROGRAMMING INFRASTRUCTURE IN SENTENCING BUT MAINLY ABOUT PROGRAMMING. BUT HOW CAN CDC ARE SAY IT'S OFFERING ALL THESE PROGRAMS WHEN IN THE LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN ALL THESE GLADIATOR FIGHTS AND OUR LOVED ONES ARE LOCKED DOWN. SEVEN TO TEN MONTHS NO PROGRAMMING NOTHING IS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND YOU GUYS CONTINUE TO PUSH THE NON DESIGNATED PROGRAMMING FACILITIES. THE INCREMENTAL RELEASES THAT IS. VIOLENCE IN THE PRISONS THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE THE YOU KNOW AND THEN THERE BEING PLACED AN AD SAY THEY'RE BEING PLACE. YOU KNOW GIVEN DA REFERRALS FOR TEN TO MYRTLE ATTEMPTED MURDER I MEAN EVERYTHING IS NEGATIVE ABOUT REHABILITATION AND PROGRAMMING IN THE PRISONS SINCE LAST YEAR SINCE KATHLEEN. ALISON DID YOU GET THE QUESTION REAL QUICK. I MEAN STILL YOU'RE TAMI PROGRAMMING BUT I DON'T SEE IT WOULD THESE GLADIATOR FIGHTS SO HOW CAN YOU TELL ME THEIR INMATES ARE PROGRAMMING OR THAT YOU'RE OFFERING OR OUR LOVED ONES PROGRAMS WHEN THEY ARE. LET'S GET THE QUESTION YOU WANT TO KNOW ARE THEY OFFERING PROGRAMS HOW ARE YOU OFFERING THE PROGRAMS WITH THESE GLADIATOR FIGHTS IN THESE LOCKED OKAY FINE THANK YOU ANYONE IT WOULD RESPONSE. IT'S GOING TO BE OUTSIDE MY POLICY. OKAY OKAY MISTER WESLEY. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INCREMENTAL RELEASES HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH SECRETARY TO USE THOSE HAVE STOPPED REALLY HAVE NO. OKAY OKAY LET HIM LET HIM GIVE HIS RESPONSE OKAY LET HIM HAVE HIS. WE LET HIM HAVE HIS RESPONSE PLEASE RENTAL RELEASES HAVE BEEN STOPPED AND THOSE THERE IS A REEVALUATION OF HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT WE'VE GIVEN THEM SOME. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND AT THIS POINT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING. WE'LL HEAR FROM SOMEONE ELSE HI MY NAME IS MARY MARINO AND JUST TO PIGGY BACK ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID. THEIR THEIR POLICY IS THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO DO A PERIOD BUT MISSILE MEAL STATED A VERY IMPORTANT POINT CDC ARE WILL USE THEIR AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CREDITS THE PROBLEM LIES ON HOW CDC ARE USES THAT AUTHORITY. AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE YOUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN TO HAVE PROVIDE A ROBUST OVERSIGHT THAT WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE YG TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THESE PRACTICES ARE APPROPRIATE. NOW A NUMBER TWO SHOULD BE AUDITS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GIVE US A QUESTION. ABOUT IN A STATEMENT BECAUSE I MY QUESTION MY QUESTION WOULD BE DO YOU. DOES IT NOT SOUND LIKE THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO PROVIDE AND A ROBUST OVERSIGHT THAT CDC ARE HAS NOT HAVE OR YEARS WANT TO NOTICE THE CDC ARE HAVE A ROBUST OVERSIGHT THAT'S A QUESTION I LIMITED. VERY LIMITED OVER SO I CAN TAKE THAT OKAY YES. TWO WEEKS AGO THAT GAVE OUR OFFICE NOW THIRTY TO INITIATE INDEPENDENT. AUDITS SO WE ARE CURRENTLY BUILDING TO OUR TEAMS TO GO OUT TO THE INSTITUTIONS AND- IT TAKES AWHILE TO HIGHER ORDERS AND GET ALL THE PROCESS BUT THESE WILL BE ROBUST. YELLOWBOOK AUDITS OF THE ISSUES THAT WE LOOK AT.

I'D I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK WITH THE I DON'T HAVE IT THEY'LL GET BACK TO YOU IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY WE- WE'VE DONE SOME WORK IN TERMS OF SENTENCING REFORM. AND I WORK CONTINUES SO I'M NOT SURE IF IT IF IT WERE FOR THE DRESSES YOUR SPECIFIC ISSUE OF THE RATIO OF ITS THE YEARS YEAH WE JUST LIKE TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON AND YOU GET SIX MONTHS IN A PROGRAM AND- I'LL BUY OUT OF BALANCE. WELL I THINK YEAH AND I THINK THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST THAN THEY ONCE WERE. OKAY I OPERATE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE NEXT PERSON. HI AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I'M WANTING TO KNOW THAT BEFORE WE TAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OR MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT COMES OUT OF THE- REPORTING. ON REFURBISHING A REBUILDING THE TWELVE ALL OF THESE PRISONS IN THE STATE.

WELL WE'VE HAD MORE THAN ONE PANEL FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IN MANY OF THE PANELS DO HAVE THOSE WHO ADVOCATE TO DO WORK IN THE PRISONS AND WHO ARE THE- NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT AND WORK DIRECTLY WITH THEM IN FACT. WE HEAR FROM THEM MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE AND SO THIS IS JUST A SMALL SAMPLING. WE HAD DAY BECAUSE WE WERE HIT DONOVAN TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE PRESIDENT DOWN UP AND A PERSON'S OVERALL.
